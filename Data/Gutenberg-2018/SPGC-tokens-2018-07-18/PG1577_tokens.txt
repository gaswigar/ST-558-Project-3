chapter

the
house
party
the
piers
of
the
main
entrance
of
chadlands
were
of
red
brick
and
upon
each
reposed
a
mighty
sphere
of
grey
granite
behind
them
stretched
away
the
park
where
forest
trees
nearly
shorn
of
their
leaves
at
the
edge
of
winter
still
answered
the
setting
sun
with
fires
of
thinning
foliage
they
sank
away
through
stretches
of
brake
fern
and
already
amid
their
trunks
arose
a
thin
blue
haze
breath
of
earth
made
visible
by
coming
cold
there
was
frost
in
the
air
and
the
sickle
of
a
new
moon
hung
where
dusk
of
evening
dimmed
the
green
of
the
western
sky
the
guns
were
returning
and
eight
men
with
three
women
arrived
at
the
lofty
gates
one
of
the
party
rode
a
grey
pony
and
a
woman
walked
on
each
side
of
him
they
chattered
together
and
the
little
company
of
people
passed
into
chadlands
park
and
trudged
forward
where
the
manor
house
rose
half
a
mile
ahead
then
an
old
man
emerged
from
a
lodge
hidden
behind
a
grove
of
laurel
and
bay
within
the
entrance
and
shut
the
great
gates
of
scroll
iron
they
were
of
a
flamboyant
italian
period
and
more
arrestive
than
distinguished
panelled
upon
them
and
belonging
to
a
later
day
than
they
had
been
imposed
two
iron
coats
of
arms
with
crest
above
and
motto
beneath
the
heraldic
bearings
of
the
present
owner
of
chadlands
he
set
store
upon
such
things
but
was
not
responsible
for
the
work
a
survival
himself
and
steeped
in
ancient
opinions
his
coat
won
in
a
forgotten
age
interested
him
only
less
than
his
mutiny
medal
his
sole
personal
claim
to
public
honor
he
had
served
in
youth
as
a
soldier
but
was
still
a
subaltern
when
his
father
died
and
he
came
into
his
kingdom
now
sir
walter
lennox
fifth
baronet
had
grown
old
and
his
invincible
kindness
of
heart
his
archaic
principles
his
great
wealth
and
the
limited
experiences
of
reality
for
which
such
wealth
was
responsible
left
him
a
popular
and
respected
man
yet
he
aroused
much
exasperation
in
local
landowners
from
his
generosity
and
scorn
of
all
economic
principles
and
while
his
tenants
held
him
the
very
exemplar
of
a
landlord
and
his
servants
worshipped
him
for
the
best
possible
reasons
his
friends
weary
of
remonstrance
were
forced
to
forgive
his
bad
precedents
and
a
mistaken
liberality
quite
beyond
the
power
of
the
average
unfortunate
who
lives
by
his
land
but
he
managed
his
great
manor
in
his
own
lavish
way
and
marvelled
that
other
men
declared
difficulties
with
problems
he
so
readily
solved
that
night
after
a
little
music
the
chadlands
house
party
drifted
to
the
and
while
most
of
the
men
after
a
heavy
day
far
afield
were
content
to
lounge
by
a
great
open
hearth
where
a
wood
fire
burned
sir
walter
who
had
been
on
a
pony
most
of
the
time
declared
himself
unwearied
and
demanded
a
game
no
excuses
henry
he
said
and
turned
to
a
young
man
lounging
in
an
outside
the
fireside
circle
the
youth
started
his
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
a
woman
sitting
beside
the
fire
with
her
hand
in
a
man
it
was
such
an
attitude
as
sophisticated
lovers
would
only
assume
in
private
but
the
pair
were
not
sophisticated
and
lovers
still
though
married
they
lacked
and
the
husband
liked
to
feel
his
wife
hand
in
his
after
all
a
thing
impossible
until
you
are
married
may
be
quite
seemly
afterwards
and
none
of
their
amiable
elders
regarded
their
devotion
with
cynicism
all
right
uncle
said
henry
lennox
he
rose
a
big
fellow
with
heavy
shoulders
a
youthful
face
and
flaxen
hair
he
had
been
handsome
save
for
a
nose
with
a
broken
bridge
but
his
pale
brown
eyes
were
fine
and
his
firm
mouth
and
chin
well
modelled
imagination
and
reflection
marked
his
countenance
sir
walter
claimed
thirty
points
on
his
scoring
board
and
gave
a
miss
with
the
spot
ball
i
win
he
said
he
was
a
small
very
upright
man
with
a
face
that
seemed
to
belong
to
his
generation
and
an
expression
seldom
to
be
seen
on
a
man
younger
than
seventy
life
had
not
puzzled
him
his
moderate
intellect
had
taken
it
as
he
found
it
and
through
the
magic
glasses
of
good
health
good
temper
and
great
wealth
judged
existence
a
desirable
thing
and
quite
easy
to
conduct
with
credit
you
only
want
patience
and
a
brain
he
always
declared
sir
walter
wore
an
eyeglass
he
was
growing
bald
but
preserved
a
pair
of
grey
whiskers
still
of
respectable
size
his
face
indeed
belied
him
for
it
was
moulded
in
a
stern
pattern
one
had
guessed
him
a
martinet
until
his
amiable
opinions
and
personality
were
manifested
the
old
man
was
not
vain
he
knew
that
a
world
very
different
from
his
own
extended
round
about
him
but
he
was
and
had
never
been
shaken
from
his
complacency
by
circumstances
he
had
been
disappointed
in
love
as
a
young
man
and
only
married
late
in
life
he
had
no
son
and
was
a
widower
facts
that
to
his
mind
quite
dwarfed
his
good
fortune
in
every
other
respect
he
held
the
comfortable
doctrine
that
things
are
always
levelled
up
and
he
honestly
believed
that
he
had
suffered
as
much
sorrow
and
disappointment
as
any
lennox
in
the
history
of
the
race
his
only
child
and
her
cousin
henry
lennox
had
been
brought
up
together
and
were
of
an
age
both
now
the
lad
was
his
uncle
heir
and
would
succeed
to
chadlands
and
the
title
and
it
had
been
sir
walter
hope
that
he
and
mary
might
marry
nor
had
the
youth
any
objection
to
such
a
plan
indeed
he
loved
mary
well
enough
there
was
even
thought
to
be
a
tacit
understanding
between
them
and
they
grew
up
in
a
friendship
which
gradually
became
ardent
on
the
man
part
though
it
never
ripened
upon
hers
but
she
knew
that
her
father
keenly
desired
this
marriage
and
supposed
that
it
would
happen
some
day
they
were
however
not
betrothed
when
the
war
burst
upon
europe
and
henry
then
went
from
the
officers
training
corps
to
the
fifth
devons
while
his
cousin
became
attached
to
the
red
cross
and
nursed
at
plymouth
the
accident
terminated
their
shadowy
romance
and
brought
real
love
into
the
woman
life
while
the
man
found
his
hopes
at
an
end
he
was
drafted
to
mesopotamia
speedily
fell
sick
of
jaundice
was
invalided
to
india
and
on
returning
to
the
front
saw
service
against
the
turks
but
chance
willed
that
he
won
no
distinction
he
did
his
duty
under
dreary
circumstances
while
to
his
hatred
of
war
was
added
the
weight
of
his
loss
when
he
heard
that
mary
had
fallen
in
love
he
was
an
ingenuous
kindly
youth
a
typical
lennox
who
had
developed
an
accomplishment
at
harrow
and
suffered
for
it
by
getting
his
nose
broken
when
winning
the
championship
of
the
public
schools
in
his
nineteenth
year
in
the
east
he
still
boxed
and
after
his
love
story
was
ended
the
epidemic
of
took
henry
also
and
he
wrote
a
volume
of
harmless
verse
to
the
undying
amazement
of
his
family
for
mary
lennox
the
war
had
brought
a
sailor
husband
captain
thomas
may
wounded
rather
severely
at
jutland
lost
his
heart
to
the
plain
but
attractive
young
woman
with
a
fine
figure
who
nursed
him
back
to
strength
and
as
he
vowed
had
saved
his
life
he
was
an
impulsive
man
of
thirty
and
he
came
from
a
little
somerset
vicarage
and
was
the
only
son
of
a
clergyman
the
rev
septimus
may
knowing
the
lady
as
nurse
mary
only
and
falling
passionately
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
proposed
on
the
day
he
was
allowed
to
sit
up
and
since
mary
lennox
shared
his
emotions
also
for
the
first
time
he
was
accepted
before
he
even
knew
her
name
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
force
of
love
advent
for
mary
lennox
she
had
come
to
believe
herself
as
vaguely
committed
to
her
cousin
and
imagined
that
her
affection
for
henry
amounted
to
as
much
as
she
was
ever
likely
to
feel
for
a
man
but
reality
awakened
her
and
its
glory
did
not
make
her
selfish
since
her
nature
was
not
constructed
so
to
be
it
only
taught
her
what
love
meant
and
convinced
her
that
she
could
never
marry
anybody
on
earth
but
the
stricken
sailor
and
this
she
knew
long
before
he
was
well
enough
to
give
a
sign
that
he
even
appreciated
her
ministry
the
very
whisper
of
his
voice
sent
a
thrill
through
her
before
he
had
gained
strength
to
speak
aloud
and
his
deep
tones
when
she
heard
them
were
like
no
voice
that
had
fallen
on
her
ear
till
then
the
first
thing
that
indicated
restoring
health
was
his
request
that
his
beard
might
be
trimmed
and
he
was
making
love
to
her
three
days
after
he
had
been
declared
out
of
danger
then
did
mary
begin
to
live
and
looking
back
she
marvelled
how
horses
and
dogs
and
a
had
been
her
life
till
now
the
revelation
bewildered
her
and
she
wrote
her
emotions
in
many
long
pages
to
her
cousin
the
causes
of
such
changes
she
did
not
indeed
specify
but
he
read
between
the
lines
and
knew
it
was
a
man
and
not
the
war
that
had
so
altered
and
deepened
her
outlook
he
had
never
done
it
and
he
could
not
be
angry
with
her
now
for
she
had
pretended
no
ardor
of
emotion
to
him
young
though
he
was
he
always
feared
that
she
liked
him
not
after
the
way
of
a
lover
he
had
hoped
to
open
her
eyes
some
day
but
it
was
given
to
another
to
do
so
he
felt
no
surprise
therefore
when
news
of
her
engagement
reached
him
from
herself
he
wrote
the
letter
of
his
life
in
reply
and
was
at
pains
to
laugh
at
their
attachment
and
lessen
any
regret
she
might
feel
on
his
account
her
father
took
it
somewhat
hardly
at
first
for
he
held
that
more
than
sufficient
misfortunes
to
correct
the
balance
of
prosperity
in
his
favor
had
already
befallen
him
but
he
was
deeply
attached
to
his
daughter
and
her
magical
change
under
the
new
and
radiant
revelation
convinced
him
that
she
had
now
awakened
to
an
emotional
fulness
of
life
which
could
only
be
the
outward
sign
of
love
that
she
was
in
love
for
the
first
time
also
seemed
clear
but
he
would
not
give
his
consent
until
he
had
seen
her
lover
and
heard
all
there
was
to
know
about
him
that
however
did
not
alarm
mary
for
she
believed
that
thomas
may
must
prove
a
spirit
after
sir
walter
heart
and
so
he
did
the
sailor
was
a
gentleman
he
had
proposed
without
the
faintest
notion
to
whom
he
offered
his
penniless
hand
and
when
he
did
find
out
was
so
bewildered
that
mary
assured
her
father
she
thought
he
would
change
his
mind
if
i
had
not
threatened
him
with
disgrace
and
breach
of
promise
i
do
think
he
would
have
thrown
me
over
she
said
and
now
they
had
been
wedded
for
six
months
and
mary
sat
by
the
great
log
fire
with
her
hand
in
tom
the
sailor
was
on
leave
but
expected
to
return
to
his
ship
at
plymouth
in
a
day
or
two
then
his
had
promised
to
visit
the
great
cruiser
for
the
navy
was
a
service
of
which
he
knew
little
lennoxes
had
all
been
soldiers
or
clergymen
since
a
great
lawyer
founded
the
race
the
game
of
billiards
proceeded
and
henry
caught
his
uncle
in
the
eighties
and
ran
out
with
an
unfinished
fifteen
then
ernest
travers
and
his
wife
old
and
dear
friends
of
sir
walter
played
a
hundred
up
the
lady
receiving
half
the
game
travers
was
a
suffolk
man
and
had
fagged
for
sir
walter
at
eton
their
comradeship
had
lasted
a
lifetime
and
no
year
passed
without
reciprocal
visits
travers
also
looked
at
life
with
the
eyes
of
a
wealthy
man
he
was
pompous
large
and
rubicund
a
backwoodsman
of
a
pattern
obsolescent
his
wife
ten
years
younger
than
himself
loved
pleasure
but
she
had
done
more
than
her
duty
in
her
opinion
and
borne
him
two
sons
and
a
daughter
they
were
colorless
people
who
lived
in
a
circle
of
others
like
themselves
the
war
had
sobered
them
and
at
an
early
stage
robbed
them
of
their
younger
boy
nelly
travers
won
her
game
amid
congratulations
and
tom
may
challenged
another
woman
a
diana
who
lived
for
sport
and
had
joined
the
house
party
with
her
uncle
felix
but
millicent
refused
i
shot
six
partridges
a
hare
and
two
pheasants
said
the
girl
and
i
half
asleep
other
men
were
present
also
of
a
type
not
dissimilar
it
was
a
conventional
gathering
of
rich
nobodies
each
a
big
frog
in
his
own
little
puddle
none
known
far
beyond
it
and
none
with
sufficient
intellect
or
ability
to
create
for
himself
any
position
in
the
world
save
that
won
by
the
accident
of
money
made
by
their
progenitors
had
it
been
necessary
for
any
of
them
to
earn
his
living
only
in
some
very
modest
capacity
and
on
a
very
modest
plane
might
they
have
done
so
of
the
entire
company
only
one
the
youngest
could
claim
even
the
celebrity
that
attached
to
his
little
volume
of
war
verses
and
now
upon
the
lives
of
these
folk
was
destined
to
break
an
event
unique
and
extraordinary
existence
that
had
meandered
without
personal
incident
save
of
a
description
common
to
them
all
was
within
twelve
hours
to
confront
men
and
women
alike
with
reality
they
were
destined
to
endure
at
close
quarters
an
occurrence
so
astounding
and
unparalleled
that
for
once
in
their
lives
they
would
find
themselves
interesting
to
the
wider
world
beyond
their
own
limited
circuit
and
for
their
friends
and
acquaintance
the
centre
of
a
nine
days
wonder
most
of
them
indeed
merely
touched
the
hem
of
the
mystery
and
were
not
involved
therein
but
even
for
them
a
reflected
glory
shone
they
were
at
least
objects
of
attraction
elsewhere
and
for
many
months
furnished
conversation
of
a
more
interesting
and
exciting
character
than
any
could
ever
claim
to
have
provided
before
the
attitude
to
such
an
event
and
the
opinions
concerning
it
of
such
people
might
have
been
pretty
accurately
predicted
nor
would
it
be
fair
to
laugh
at
their
terror
and
bewilderment
their
confusion
of
tongues
and
the
fatuous
theories
they
adventured
by
way
of
explanation
for
wiser
than
they
men
experienced
in
the
problems
of
humanity
and
trained
to
solve
its
enigmas
were
presently
in
no
better
case
a
very
trivial
and
innocent
remark
was
prelude
to
the
disaster
and
had
the
speaker
guessed
what
his
jest
must
presently
mean
in
terms
of
human
misery
grief
and
horror
it
is
certain
enough
that
he
would
not
have
spoken
the
women
were
gone
to
bed
and
the
men
sat
around
the
fire
smoking
and
admiring
sir
walter
ancient
blend
of
whisky
he
himself
had
just
flung
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
and
was
admonishing
his
church
tom
none
of
your
larks
when
first
you
came
to
see
me
remember
you
went
to
church
twice
on
sunday
like
a
lamb
i
have
no
backsliding
mary
will
see
to
that
governor
and
you
henry
sir
walter
disappointed
of
his
hopes
respecting
his
nephew
and
daughter
had
none
the
less
treated
the
young
man
with
tact
and
tenderness
he
felt
for
henry
he
was
also
fond
of
him
and
doubted
not
that
the
youth
would
prove
a
worthy
successor
thomas
may
was
one
with
whom
none
could
quarrel
and
he
and
his
wife
old
flame
were
now
after
the
acquaintance
of
a
week
on
friendly
terms
i
sha
fail
uncle
will
anybody
have
another
whisky
asked
sir
walter
rising
it
was
the
signal
for
departure
and
invariably
followed
the
stroke
of
a
grandfather
clock
in
the
hall
when
eleven
sounded
the
master
rose
but
he
was
delayed
tom
may
spoke
has
never
heard
the
ghost
story
governor
he
said
and
travers
badly
wants
another
drink
if
he
does
have
one
he
sleep
all
night
he
done
ten
men
work
spoke
i
did
know
you
had
a
ghost
sir
walter
i
tremendously
interested
in
psychical
research
and
so
on
if
it
not
bothering
you
and
keeping
you
up
a
ghost
at
chadlands
walter
asked
ernest
travers
you
never
told
me
ghosts
are
all
humbug
declared
another
speaker
a
youthful
colonel
of
the
war
i
deprecate
that
attitude
vane
it
may
certainly
be
that
our
ghost
is
a
humbug
or
rather
that
we
have
no
such
thing
as
a
ghost
at
all
and
that
is
my
own
impression
but
an
idle
generality
is
always
futile
indeed
any
generality
usually
is
you
have
at
least
no
right
to
say
are
all
humbug
because
you
can
not
prove
they
are
the
weight
of
evidence
is
very
much
on
the
other
side
sorry
said
colonel
vane
a
man
without
pride
i
did
know
you
believed
in
sir
walter
most
emphatically
i
believe
in
them
so
do
i
declared
ernest
travers
nay
so
does
my
wife
for
the
best
possible
reason
a
friend
of
hers
actually
saw
one
spoke
spiritualism
and
spirits
are
two
quite
different
things
he
said
one
may
discredit
the
whole
business
of
spiritualism
and
yet
firmly
believe
in
spirits
he
was
a
man
with
grey
hair
and
moustache
he
had
a
small
body
on
very
long
legs
and
though
a
veteran
now
was
still
one
of
the
best
game
shots
in
the
west
of
england
ernest
travers
agreed
with
him
indeed
they
all
agreed
sir
walter
himself
summed
up
if
you
a
christian
you
must
believe
in
the
spirits
of
the
dead
he
declared
but
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
summon
these
spirits
to
call
them
from
the
next
world
back
to
ours
and
to
consult
people
who
profess
to
be
able
to
do
so
extremely
doubtful
characters
as
a
rule
that
i
think
is
much
to
be
condemned
i
deny
that
there
are
any
living
mediums
of
communication
between
the
spirit
world
and
this
one
and
i
should
always
judge
the
man
or
woman
who
claimed
such
power
to
be
a
charlatan
but
that
spirits
of
the
departed
have
appeared
and
been
recognized
by
the
living
who
shall
deny
my
has
a
striking
case
in
his
own
recent
experience
he
actually
knows
a
man
who
was
going
to
sail
on
the
lusitania
and
his
greatest
friend
on
earth
a
soldier
who
fell
on
the
maine
appeared
to
him
and
advised
him
not
to
do
so
tom
acquaintance
could
not
say
that
he
heard
words
uttered
but
he
certainly
recognized
his
dead
friend
as
he
stood
by
his
bedside
and
he
received
into
his
mind
a
clear
warning
before
the
vision
disappeared
is
that
so
tom
exactly
so
sir
and
jack
thwaites
that
was
the
name
of
the
man
in
new
york
told
four
others
about
it
and
three
took
his
tip
and
did
sail
the
fourth
went
but
he
was
drowned
he
came
out
all
right
the
departed
are
certainly
proved
to
appear
in
their
own
ghostly
persons
nay
they
often
have
been
seen
to
do
so
admitted
travers
but
i
will
never
believe
they
are
at
our
beck
and
call
to
bang
tambourines
or
move
furniture
we
can
not
ring
up
the
dead
as
we
ring
up
the
living
on
a
telephone
the
idea
is
insufferable
and
indecent
neither
can
anybody
be
used
as
a
in
that
way
or
tell
us
the
present
position
or
occupation
and
interests
of
a
dead
man
or
what
he
smokes
or
how
his
liquor
tastes
such
ideas
degrade
our
impressions
of
life
beyond
the
grave
they
are
if
i
may
say
so
disgustingly
anthropomorphic
how
can
we
even
take
it
for
granted
that
our
spirits
will
retain
a
human
form
and
human
attributes
after
death
it
would
be
both
and
irreligious
to
attempt
to
get
at
these
things
no
doubt
declared
colonel
vane
and
they
make
confusion
worse
confounded
by
saying
that
evil
spirits
pretend
sometimes
to
hoodwink
us
by
posing
as
good
spirits
now
going
too
far
said
henry
lennox
but
your
own
ghost
sir
walter
asked
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
most
really
ancient
houses
have
some
such
addition
is
it
a
family
spectre
is
it
fairly
well
authenticated
does
it
reign
in
a
particular
spot
of
house
or
garden
i
ask
from
no
idle
curiosity
it
is
a
very
interesting
subject
if
approached
in
a
proper
spirit
as
the
psychical
research
society
of
which
i
am
a
member
does
approach
it
i
am
unprepared
to
admit
that
we
have
a
ghost
at
all
repeated
sir
walter
ancient
houses
as
you
say
often
get
some
legend
tacked
on
to
them
and
here
a
garden
walk
or
there
a
room
or
passage
is
associated
with
something
uncanny
and
contrary
to
experience
this
is
an
old
tudor
place
and
has
been
tinkered
and
altered
in
successive
generations
we
have
one
room
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
great
corridor
which
always
suffered
from
a
bad
reputation
nobody
has
ever
seen
anything
in
our
time
and
neither
my
father
nor
grandfather
ever
handed
down
any
story
of
a
personal
experience
it
is
a
bedroom
which
you
shall
see
if
you
care
to
do
so
one
very
unfortunate
and
melancholy
thing
happened
in
it
that
was
some
twelve
years
ago
when
mary
was
still
a
child
two
years
after
my
dear
wife
died
tell
us
nothing
that
can
cause
you
any
pain
walter
said
ernest
travers
it
caused
me
very
acute
pain
at
the
time
now
it
is
old
history
and
mercifully
one
can
look
back
with
nothing
but
regret
one
must
however
mention
an
incident
in
my
father
time
though
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
own
painful
experience
however
that
is
part
of
the
story
if
story
it
can
be
called
a
death
occurred
in
the
grey
room
when
i
was
a
child
owing
to
the
general
vague
feeling
entertained
against
it
we
never
put
guests
there
and
so
long
ago
as
my
father
day
it
was
relegated
to
a
store
place
and
but
one
christmas
when
we
were
very
full
there
came
quite
unexpectedly
on
christmas
eve
an
aunt
of
my
father
an
extraordinary
old
character
who
never
did
anything
that
might
be
foreseen
she
had
never
come
to
the
family
reunion
before
yet
appeared
on
this
occasion
and
declared
that
as
this
was
going
to
be
her
last
christmas
on
earth
she
had
felt
it
right
to
join
the
clan
my
father
being
the
head
of
the
family
her
sudden
advent
strained
our
resources
i
suppose
but
she
herself
reminded
us
of
the
grey
room
and
on
hearing
that
it
was
empty
insisted
on
occupying
it
the
place
is
a
bedroom
and
my
father
who
personally
entertained
no
dislike
or
dread
of
it
raised
not
the
least
objection
to
the
old
proposal
she
retired
and
was
found
dead
on
christmas
morning
she
had
not
gone
to
bed
but
was
just
about
to
do
so
apparently
when
she
had
fallen
down
and
died
she
was
had
undergone
a
lengthy
coach
journey
from
exeter
and
had
eaten
a
remarkably
good
dinner
before
going
to
bed
her
maid
was
not
suspected
and
the
doctor
held
her
end
in
no
way
unusual
it
was
certainly
never
associated
with
anything
but
natural
causes
indeed
only
events
of
much
later
date
served
to
remind
me
of
the
matter
then
one
remembered
the
spoiled
christmas
festivities
and
the
callous
and
selfish
anger
of
myself
and
various
other
young
people
that
our
rejoicings
should
be
spoiled
and
christmas
shorn
of
all
its
usual
delights
but
twelve
years
ago
mary
fell
ill
of
pneumonia
dangerously
and
a
nurse
had
to
be
summoned
in
haste
since
her
own
faithful
attendant
jane
bond
who
is
still
with
us
could
not
attend
her
both
day
and
night
a
telegram
to
the
nurses
institute
brought
gilbert
forrester
forrester
as
she
preferred
to
be
called
she
was
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
but
most
attractive
and
capable
she
had
been
a
nurse
before
she
married
a
young
medical
man
and
upon
his
unfortunate
death
she
returned
to
her
profession
she
desired
her
bedroom
to
be
as
near
the
patient
as
possible
and
objected
when
she
found
it
arranged
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
not
the
next
room
she
inquired
and
i
had
to
tell
her
that
the
next
room
suffered
from
a
bad
name
and
was
not
used
bad
name
is
it
unwholesome
she
asked
and
i
explained
that
traditions
credited
it
with
a
sinister
influence
fact
i
said
is
supposed
to
be
haunted
not
i
added
anything
has
ever
been
seen
or
heard
in
my
lifetime
but
nervous
people
do
not
like
that
sort
of
room
and
i
should
never
take
the
responsibility
of
putting
anybody
into
it
without
telling
them
she
laughed
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
ghosts
sir
walter
she
said
that
must
obviously
be
my
room
if
you
please
it
is
necessary
i
should
be
as
near
my
patient
as
possible
so
that
i
can
be
called
at
once
if
her
own
nurse
is
anxious
when
i
am
not
on
duty
well
we
saw
of
course
that
she
was
perfectly
right
she
was
a
fearless
little
woman
and
chaffed
masters
and
the
maids
while
they
lighted
a
fire
and
made
the
room
comfortable
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
an
exceedingly
pleasant
room
in
every
respect
yet
i
hesitated
and
could
not
say
that
i
was
easy
about
it
i
felt
conscious
of
a
discomfort
which
even
her
indifference
did
not
entirely
banish
i
attributed
it
to
my
acute
anxiety
over
mary
also
to
a
shadow
of
what
it
may
have
been
irritation
at
nurse
forrester
unconcealed
contempt
for
my
superstition
the
grey
room
is
large
and
commodious
with
a
rather
fine
oriel
window
above
our
eastern
porch
she
was
delighted
and
rated
me
very
amusingly
for
my
doubts
hope
you
never
call
such
a
lovely
room
haunted
again
after
i
have
gone
said
she
mary
took
to
her
and
really
seemed
easier
after
she
had
been
in
the
an
hour
she
loved
young
people
and
had
an
art
to
win
them
she
was
also
a
most
accomplished
and
nurse
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
touch
of
genius
about
her
her
voice
was
melodious
and
her
touch
gentle
i
could
appreciate
her
skill
for
i
was
never
far
from
my
daughter
side
during
that
anxious
day
forrester
came
at
the
critical
hours
but
declared
herself
very
sanguine
from
the
first
night
fell
the
child
was
sleeping
and
jane
bond
arrived
to
relieve
the
other
about
ten
then
the
lady
retired
directed
that
she
should
be
called
at
seven
or
at
any
moment
sooner
if
jane
wanted
her
i
sat
with
jane
i
remember
until
two
and
then
turned
in
myself
before
i
did
so
mary
drank
some
milk
and
seemed
to
be
holding
her
strength
well
i
was
worn
out
and
despite
my
anxiety
fell
into
deep
sleep
and
did
not
wake
until
my
man
called
me
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
what
he
told
me
brought
me
quickly
to
my
senses
and
out
of
bed
nurse
forrester
had
been
called
at
seven
but
had
not
responded
nor
could
the
maid
open
the
door
for
it
was
locked
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
housekeeper
and
jane
bond
had
loudly
summoned
her
without
receiving
any
reply
then
they
called
me
i
could
only
direct
that
the
door
should
be
forced
open
as
speedily
as
possible
and
we
were
engaged
in
this
task
when
mannering
my
medical
man
who
shot
with
us
arrived
to
see
mary
i
told
him
what
had
happened
he
went
in
to
look
at
my
girl
and
felt
satisfied
that
she
was
holding
her
own
well
indeed
he
thought
her
stronger
and
just
as
he
told
me
so
the
door
into
the
grey
room
yielded
mannering
and
my
housekeeper
forbes
entered
the
room
while
masters
fred
caunter
my
footman
who
had
broken
down
the
lock
and
i
remained
outside
the
doctor
presently
called
me
and
i
went
in
nurse
forrester
was
apparently
lying
awake
in
bed
but
she
was
not
awake
she
slept
the
sleep
of
death
her
eyes
were
open
but
glazed
and
she
was
already
cold
mannering
declared
that
she
had
been
dead
for
a
good
many
hours
yet
save
for
a
slight
but
hardly
unnatural
pallor
not
a
trace
of
death
marked
the
poor
little
creature
an
expression
of
wonder
seemed
to
sit
on
her
features
but
otherwise
she
was
looking
much
as
i
had
last
seen
her
when
she
said
everything
appeared
to
be
orderly
in
the
room
it
was
now
flooded
with
the
first
light
of
a
sunny
morning
for
she
had
drawn
her
blind
up
and
thrown
her
window
wide
open
the
poor
lady
passed
out
of
life
without
a
sound
or
signal
to
indicate
trouble
for
in
the
silence
of
night
jane
bond
must
have
heard
any
alarm
had
she
raised
one
to
me
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
that
we
gazed
upon
a
corpse
but
so
it
was
though
as
a
matter
of
form
the
doctor
took
certain
measures
to
restore
her
but
animation
was
not
suspended
it
had
passed
beyond
recall
there
was
held
a
examination
and
an
inquest
of
course
and
mannering
who
felt
deep
professional
interest
asked
a
friend
from
plymouth
to
conduct
the
examination
their
report
astounded
all
concerned
and
crowned
the
mystery
for
not
a
trace
of
any
physical
trouble
could
be
discovered
to
explain
nurse
forrester
death
she
was
thin
but
organically
sound
in
every
particular
nor
could
the
slightest
trace
of
poison
be
reported
life
had
simply
left
her
without
any
physical
reason
search
proved
that
she
had
brought
no
drugs
or
any
sort
of
physic
with
her
and
no
information
to
cast
the
least
light
came
from
the
institution
for
which
she
worked
she
was
a
favorite
there
and
the
news
of
her
sudden
death
brought
sorrow
to
her
many
personal
friends
the
physicians
felt
their
failure
to
find
a
natural
and
scientific
cause
for
her
death
indeed
mordred
from
plymouth
an
eminent
pathologist
trembled
not
a
little
about
it
as
mannering
afterwards
told
me
the
finite
mind
of
science
hates
apparently
to
be
faced
with
any
mystery
beyond
its
power
to
explain
it
regards
such
an
incident
as
a
challenge
to
human
intellect
and
does
not
remember
that
we
are
encompassed
with
mystery
as
with
a
garment
and
that
every
day
and
every
night
are
laden
with
phenomena
for
which
man
can
not
account
and
never
will
nurse
forrester
relations
a
sister
and
an
old
mother
came
to
the
funeral
also
her
dearest
woman
friend
another
professional
nurse
whose
name
i
do
not
recollect
she
was
buried
at
chadlands
and
her
grave
lies
near
our
graves
mary
loves
to
tend
it
still
though
to
her
the
dead
woman
is
but
a
name
yet
to
this
day
she
declares
that
she
can
remember
nurse
forrester
voice
through
her
fever
gentle
yet
musical
and
cheerful
as
for
me
i
never
mourned
so
brief
an
acquaintance
so
heartily
to
part
with
the
bright
creature
so
full
of
life
and
kindliness
and
to
stand
beside
her
corpse
but
eight
or
nine
hours
afterwards
was
a
chastening
and
sad
experience
sir
walter
became
pensive
and
did
not
proceed
for
the
space
of
a
minute
none
however
spoke
until
he
had
again
done
so
that
is
the
story
of
what
is
called
our
haunted
room
so
far
as
this
generation
is
concerned
what
grounds
for
its
sinister
reputation
existed
in
the
far
past
i
know
not
only
a
vague
oral
tradition
came
to
my
father
from
his
and
it
is
certain
that
neither
of
them
attached
any
personal
importance
to
it
but
after
such
a
peculiar
and
unfortunate
tragedy
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
i
regarded
the
chamber
as
ruled
out
from
my
domiciliary
scheme
and
denied
it
to
any
future
guests
do
you
really
associate
the
lady
death
with
the
room
walter
asked
travers
honestly
i
do
not
ernest
and
for
this
reason
i
deny
that
any
malignant
spiritual
personality
would
ever
be
permitted
by
the
creator
to
exercise
physical
powers
over
the
living
or
destroy
human
beings
without
reason
or
justice
the
horror
of
such
a
possibility
to
the
normal
mind
is
sufficient
argument
against
it
causes
beyond
our
apparent
knowledge
were
responsible
for
the
death
of
nurse
forrester
but
who
shall
presume
to
say
that
was
really
so
why
imagine
anything
so
irregular
i
prefer
to
think
that
had
the
been
conducted
by
somebody
else
subtle
reasons
for
her
death
might
have
appeared
science
is
fallible
and
even
specialists
make
outrageous
mistakes
you
believe
she
died
from
natural
causes
beyond
the
skill
of
those
particular
surgeons
to
discover
asked
colonel
vane
that
is
my
opinion
needless
to
say
i
should
not
tell
mannering
so
but
to
what
other
conclusion
can
a
reasonable
man
come
i
do
not
of
course
deny
the
supernatural
but
it
is
to
fall
back
upon
it
as
the
line
of
least
resistance
then
repeated
his
question
he
had
listened
with
intense
interest
to
the
story
would
you
deny
that
ghosts
so
to
call
them
can
be
associated
with
one
particular
spot
to
the
discomfort
and
even
loss
of
reason
or
life
of
those
that
may
be
in
that
spot
at
the
psychological
moment
sir
walter
emphatically
i
would
deny
it
declared
the
elder
however
tragic
the
circumstances
that
might
have
befallen
an
unfortunate
being
in
life
at
any
particular
place
it
is
in
my
opinion
monstrous
to
suppose
his
disembodied
spirit
will
hereafter
be
associated
with
the
place
we
must
be
reasonable
felix
shall
the
god
who
gave
us
reason
be
himself
unreasonable
and
yet
there
are
authentic
however
i
admit
the
weight
of
your
argument
at
the
same
time
ventured
travers
none
can
deny
that
many
strange
and
terrible
things
happen
from
hidden
causes
quite
beyond
human
power
to
explain
they
do
ernest
and
so
i
lock
up
my
grey
room
and
rule
it
out
of
our
scheme
of
existence
at
present
it
is
full
of
lumber
old
furniture
and
a
pack
of
rubbishy
family
portraits
that
only
deserve
to
be
burned
but
will
some
day
be
restored
i
suppose
not
on
my
account
uncle
walter
said
henry
lennox
i
have
no
more
respect
for
them
than
yourself
they
are
hopeless
as
art
no
no
one
must
restore
them
the
art
is
i
believe
very
bad
as
you
say
but
they
were
most
worthy
people
and
this
is
the
sole
memorial
remaining
of
them
do
let
us
see
the
room
governor
urged
tom
may
mary
showed
it
to
me
the
first
time
i
came
here
and
i
thought
it
about
the
jolliest
spot
in
the
house
so
it
is
tom
said
henry
mary
says
it
should
be
called
the
rose
room
not
the
grey
one
all
who
care
to
do
so
can
see
it
answered
sir
walter
rising
we
will
look
in
on
our
way
to
bed
get
the
key
from
my
in
the
study
henry
it
labelled
room
chapter
ii
an
experiment
ernest
travers
felix
tom
may
and
colonel
vane
followed
sir
walter
upstairs
to
a
great
corridor
which
ran
the
length
of
the
main
front
and
upon
which
opened
a
dozen
bedrooms
and
they
proceeded
to
the
eastern
extremity
it
was
lighted
throughout
and
now
their
leader
took
off
an
electric
bulb
from
a
sconce
on
the
wall
outside
the
room
they
had
come
to
visit
there
is
none
in
there
he
explained
though
the
light
was
installed
in
the
grey
room
as
elsewhere
when
i
started
my
own
plant
twenty
years
ago
my
father
never
would
have
it
he
disliked
it
exceedingly
and
believed
it
aged
the
eyes
henry
arrived
with
the
key
the
door
was
unlocked
and
the
light
established
the
party
entered
a
large
and
lofty
chamber
with
ceiling
of
elaborate
plaster
work
and
walls
the
paper
on
which
was
somewhat
tarnished
a
pattern
of
dim
pink
roses
as
large
as
cabbages
ran
riot
over
it
a
great
oriel
window
looked
east
while
a
smaller
one
opened
upon
the
south
round
the
curve
of
the
oriel
ran
a
cushioned
seat
eighteen
inches
above
the
ground
while
on
the
western
side
of
the
room
set
in
the
internal
wall
was
a
modern
fireplace
with
a
white
adams
mantel
above
it
some
old
carved
chairs
stood
round
the
walls
and
in
one
corner
stacked
together
lay
half
a
dozen
old
oil
portraits
grimy
and
faded
they
called
for
the
restorer
but
were
doubtfully
worth
his
labors
two
large
chests
of
drawers
with
rounded
bellies
and
a
very
beautiful
also
occupied
places
round
the
room
and
against
the
inner
wall
rose
a
single
fourposter
bed
of
spanish
chestnut
also
carved
a
grey
carpet
covered
the
floor
and
on
one
of
the
chests
stood
a
miniature
bronze
copy
of
the
faun
of
praxiteles
the
apartment
was
bright
and
cheerful
of
aspect
nothing
gloomy
or
depressing
marked
it
nor
a
suggestion
of
the
sinister
could
one
wish
for
a
more
amiable
looking
room
asked
they
gazed
round
them
and
ernest
travers
expressed
admiration
at
the
old
furniture
my
dear
walter
why
hide
these
things
here
he
asked
they
are
beautiful
and
may
be
valuable
too
i
been
asked
the
same
question
before
answered
the
owner
and
they
are
valuable
lord
bolsover
offered
me
a
thousand
guineas
for
those
two
chairs
but
the
things
are
heirlooms
in
a
sort
of
way
and
i
should
feel
justified
in
parting
with
them
my
grandfather
was
furniture
mad
spent
half
his
time
collecting
old
stuff
on
the
continent
spain
was
his
happy
hunting
ground
it
positively
a
shame
to
doom
these
chairs
to
a
haunted
room
uncle
declared
henry
but
the
other
shook
his
head
and
smothered
a
yawn
the
house
is
too
full
as
it
is
he
said
mary
wants
you
to
scrap
dozens
of
things
replied
his
nephew
then
there
be
plenty
of
room
you
do
what
you
please
when
your
turn
comes
and
no
doubt
cast
out
my
tusks
and
antlers
and
which
i
know
you
do
admire
wait
in
patience
henry
and
we
will
now
go
to
bed
answered
the
elder
i
am
fatigued
and
it
must
be
nearly
midnight
then
tom
may
brought
their
thoughts
back
to
the
reason
of
the
visit
look
here
governor
he
said
it
a
scandal
to
give
a
champion
room
like
this
a
bad
name
and
shut
it
up
you
fallen
into
the
habit
but
you
know
it
all
nonsense
mary
loves
this
room
i
make
you
a
sporting
offer
let
me
sleep
in
it
and
then
when
i
report
a
clean
bill
you
can
throw
it
open
again
and
announce
it
is
forgiven
without
a
stain
on
its
character
you
just
said
you
believe
spooks
have
the
power
to
hurt
anybody
then
let
me
turn
in
here
sir
walter
however
refused
no
tom
most
certainly
not
it
far
too
late
to
go
over
the
ground
again
and
explain
why
but
i
do
wish
it
a
room
was
never
seen
said
ernest
travers
you
must
let
me
look
at
it
by
daylight
and
bring
nelly
the
ceiling
too
is
evidently
very
fine
finer
even
than
the
one
in
my
room
the
ceilings
here
were
all
the
work
of
italians
in
tudor
times
explained
his
friend
they
are
elizabethan
the
plaster
is
certainly
wonderful
and
my
ceilings
are
considered
as
good
as
anything
in
the
country
i
believe
he
turned
and
the
rest
followed
him
henry
removed
the
electric
bulb
and
restored
it
to
its
place
outside
then
his
uncle
gave
him
the
key
put
it
back
in
the
cabinet
he
said
i
wo
go
down
again
the
party
broke
up
and
all
save
lennox
and
the
sailor
went
to
their
rooms
the
two
younger
men
descended
together
and
when
out
of
of
his
uncle
henry
spoke
look
here
tom
he
said
you
given
me
a
tip
i
going
to
camp
out
in
the
grey
room
then
in
the
morning
i
tell
uncle
walter
i
have
done
so
and
the
ghost
number
will
be
up
quite
all
right
old
man
only
the
plan
must
be
modified
sleep
there
i
death
on
it
and
the
brilliant
inspiration
was
mine
remember
you
ca
he
refused
to
let
you
i
did
hear
him
oh
yes
you
did
everybody
did
besides
this
is
fairly
my
task
you
wo
deny
that
chadlands
will
be
mine
some
day
so
it
up
to
me
to
knock
this
musty
yarn
on
the
head
once
and
for
all
could
anything
be
more
absurd
than
shutting
up
a
fine
room
like
that
i
really
rather
ashamed
of
uncle
walter
of
course
it
absurd
but
honestly
i
rather
keen
about
this
dearly
love
to
add
a
medieval
phantom
to
my
experiences
and
only
wish
i
thought
anything
would
show
up
i
beg
you
raise
no
objection
it
was
my
idea
and
i
very
much
wish
to
make
the
experiment
of
course
i
believe
in
anything
supernatural
they
went
back
to
the
dismissed
fred
caunter
the
footman
who
was
waiting
to
put
out
the
lights
and
continued
their
discussion
the
argument
began
to
grow
strenuous
for
each
proved
determined
and
who
owned
the
stronger
will
seemed
a
doubtful
question
for
a
time
since
no
conclusion
could
satisfy
both
they
abandoned
the
centre
of
contention
and
debated
as
their
elders
had
done
on
the
general
question
henry
declared
himself
not
wholly
convinced
he
adopted
an
agnostic
attitude
while
tom
frankly
disbelieved
the
one
preserved
an
open
mind
the
other
scoffed
at
apparitions
in
general
it
humbug
to
say
sailors
are
superstitious
now
he
asserted
they
might
have
been
but
my
experience
is
that
they
are
no
more
credulous
than
other
people
in
these
days
anyway
i
not
life
is
a
matter
of
chemistry
there
no
mumbo
jumbo
about
it
in
my
opinion
chemical
analysis
has
reached
down
to
hormones
and
enzymes
and
all
manner
of
subtle
secretions
discovered
by
this
generation
of
inquirers
but
it
all
organic
nobody
has
ever
found
anything
that
is
existence
depends
on
matter
and
when
the
chemical
process
breaks
down
the
organism
perishes
and
leaves
nothing
when
a
man
ca
go
on
breathing
he
dead
and
there
an
end
of
him
but
henry
had
read
modern
science
also
what
about
the
vital
spark
then
biologists
do
turn
down
the
theory
of
vitalism
do
they
most
of
them
do
who
count
my
dear
chap
the
presence
of
a
vital
spark
a
spark
that
can
not
be
put
out
is
merely
a
theory
with
nothing
to
prove
it
when
he
dies
the
animating
principle
does
leave
a
man
and
go
off
on
its
own
it
dies
too
it
was
part
of
the
man
as
much
as
his
heart
or
brain
that
only
an
opinion
nobody
can
be
positive
we
do
know
anything
about
what
life
really
means
and
we
have
got
the
machinery
to
find
out
by
analogy
we
can
argued
tom
where
are
you
going
to
draw
the
line
life
is
life
and
a
sponge
is
just
as
much
alive
as
a
herring
a
nettle
is
just
as
much
alive
as
an
and
an
is
just
as
much
alive
as
you
are
what
becomes
of
its
vital
spark
when
you
eat
an
oyster
you
would
believe
in
a
life
after
death
at
all
then
it
a
pure
assumption
henry
i
like
to
believe
in
it
who
would
because
if
you
honestly
did
it
would
transform
this
life
into
something
infinitely
different
from
what
it
is
it
ought
to
yet
it
does
seem
to
it
ought
to
certainly
if
you
believe
this
life
is
only
the
portal
to
another
of
much
greater
importance
then
well
there
you
are
nothing
matters
but
trying
to
make
everybody
else
believe
it
too
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
people
who
do
believe
it
or
think
they
do
seem
to
me
just
as
concentrated
on
this
life
and
just
as
much
out
to
get
the
very
best
they
can
from
it
and
wring
it
dry
as
i
am
who
reckon
all
they
believe
as
a
matter
of
course
and
do
seem
to
realize
how
much
their
belief
ought
to
imply
confessed
henry
why
do
they
believe
because
most
of
them
have
really
thought
about
it
more
than
a
turnip
thinks
they
dwell
in
a
foggy
sort
of
way
on
the
future
life
when
they
go
to
church
on
sundays
then
they
return
home
and
forget
all
about
it
till
next
sunday
lennox
brought
him
back
to
the
present
difference
well
seeing
you
laugh
at
ghosts
and
i
remain
doubtful
it
only
fair
that
i
sleep
in
the
grey
room
you
must
see
that
ghosts
hate
people
who
do
believe
in
them
they
cold
shoulder
you
but
in
my
case
they
might
feel
i
was
good
material
worth
convincing
they
might
show
up
for
me
in
a
friendly
spirit
if
they
show
for
you
it
will
probably
be
to
bully
you
tom
laughed
that
what
i
want
i
like
to
have
it
out
and
talk
sense
to
a
spook
and
show
him
what
an
ass
he
making
of
himself
the
governor
was
right
about
that
when
asked
if
he
believed
in
them
loafing
about
a
place
where
they
been
murdered
or
otherwise
maltreated
he
rejected
the
idea
yet
a
woman
certainly
died
there
and
without
a
shadow
of
reason
she
probably
died
for
a
very
good
reason
only
we
do
happen
to
know
it
henry
tried
a
different
argument
you
married
and
you
matter
i
not
married
and
do
matter
to
anybody
humbug
mary
would
like
it
anyway
you
know
that
true
she
hate
it
but
she
wo
know
anything
about
it
till
she
always
sleeps
in
her
old
nursery
when
she
comes
here
and
i
down
the
corridor
at
the
far
end
she
have
a
fit
if
she
knew
turned
in
next
door
to
her
and
was
snoozing
in
the
grey
room
but
she
wo
know
till
i
tell
her
of
my
rash
act
do
think
i
a
fool
nobody
loves
life
better
than
i
do
and
nobody
has
better
reason
to
but
i
positive
that
this
is
all
rank
nonsense
and
so
are
you
really
we
know
there
nothing
in
the
room
with
a
shadow
of
supernatural
danger
about
it
besides
you
would
want
to
sleep
there
so
badly
if
you
believed
anything
wicked
was
waiting
for
you
tons
cleverer
than
i
am
so
you
must
agree
about
that
lennox
was
bound
to
confess
that
he
entertained
no
personal
fear
they
still
argued
and
the
clock
struck
midnight
then
the
sailor
made
a
suggestion
since
you
so
infernally
obstinate
i
do
this
we
toss
up
and
the
winner
can
have
the
fun
that
fair
to
both
the
other
agreed
he
tossed
a
coin
and
may
called
tails
and
won
he
was
jubilant
while
henry
showed
a
measure
of
annoyance
the
other
consoled
him
it
better
so
old
man
you
highly
strung
and
nervy
and
a
poet
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
no
better
than
a
prize
ox
and
do
know
what
nerves
mean
i
can
sleep
anywhere
anyhow
if
you
can
sleep
in
a
submarine
you
bet
you
can
in
a
nice
airy
elizabethan
room
even
if
it
is
haunted
but
it
not
that
the
whole
point
there
not
a
haunted
room
in
the
world
get
me
your
service
revolver
like
a
good
chap
henry
was
silent
and
tom
rose
to
make
ready
for
his
vigil
i
anyhow
he
said
nothing
less
than
queen
elizabeth
herself
will
keep
me
awake
if
it
does
appear
then
the
other
surprised
him
do
think
i
want
to
go
back
on
it
you
won
the
right
to
make
the
experiment
if
we
ignore
uncle
walter
but
well
you
laugh
yet
on
my
honor
tom
i
got
a
feeling
i
rather
you
did
it
nerves
i
not
nervy
any
more
than
you
are
i
not
suggesting
that
i
go
now
of
course
but
i
do
ask
you
to
think
better
of
it
and
chuck
the
thing
why
well
one
ca
help
one
feelings
i
do
feel
a
rum
sort
of
conviction
at
the
bottom
of
my
mind
that
it
not
good
enough
i
ca
explain
there
are
no
words
for
it
that
i
know
but
it
growing
on
me
intuition
perhaps
intuition
of
what
i
ca
tell
you
but
i
ask
you
not
to
go
you
were
going
if
you
won
the
toss
i
know
then
your
growing
intuition
is
only
because
i
won
it
hanged
if
i
think
you
want
to
funk
me
old
man
i
could
do
that
but
it
different
me
going
and
you
going
i
got
nothing
to
live
for
do
think
i
maudlin
or
any
rot
of
that
sort
but
you
know
all
about
the
past
i
never
mentioned
it
to
you
and
of
course
you
have
to
me
and
i
never
should
have
but
i
will
now
i
loved
mary
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
tom
she
did
know
how
much
and
probably
i
did
either
but
that
done
and
no
man
on
earth
rejoices
in
her
great
happiness
more
than
i
do
and
no
man
on
earth
is
going
to
be
a
better
or
a
truer
friend
to
you
and
her
than
please
god
i
shall
be
but
that
being
so
ca
you
see
the
rest
my
life
ended
in
a
way
when
the
dream
of
my
life
ended
i
attach
no
importance
to
living
for
itself
and
if
anything
final
happened
to
me
it
would
leave
a
blank
anywhere
you
different
in
sober
honesty
you
ought
to
run
into
any
needless
danger
real
or
imaginary
i
thinking
of
mary
only
when
i
say
that
not
you
but
i
deny
the
danger
yes
only
you
might
listen
so
did
i
but
i
deny
it
no
longer
the
case
is
altered
when
i
tell
you
in
all
seriousness
when
i
take
my
oath
if
you
like
that
i
do
believe
now
there
is
something
in
this
i
say
it
supernatural
and
i
do
say
it
is
but
i
do
feel
deeply
impressed
in
my
mind
now
and
it
growing
stronger
every
minute
that
there
something
here
out
of
the
common
and
really
infernally
dangerous
the
other
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
what
bee
has
got
into
your
bonnet
do
call
it
that
it
a
conviction
tom
do
be
guided
by
me
old
chap
the
sailor
flushed
a
little
emptied
his
glass
and
rose
if
you
really
wanted
to
choke
me
off
you
chose
a
funny
way
to
do
so
surely
it
only
needed
this
to
determine
anybody
if
you
as
a
sane
person
honestly
believe
there
a
pinch
of
danger
in
that
blessed
place
then
i
certainly
sleep
there
or
else
wake
there
let
me
come
too
then
tom
that
be
damned
for
a
yarn
ghosts
do
show
up
for
two
people
got
pluck
enough
if
i
get
any
sport
i
be
quite
straight
about
it
and
you
shall
try
your
luck
i
can
only
make
it
a
favor
and
not
for
your
own
sake
either
i
know
mary
will
be
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
in
the
next
room
how
little
she
guess
perhaps
if
i
see
an
apparition
worthy
of
the
golden
age
i
call
her
up
do
oblige
me
may
in
anything
on
earth
but
this
thing
it
really
too
late
now
you
see
you
defeated
your
own
object
you
must
ask
me
to
throw
up
the
sponge
to
your
sudden
intuition
of
danger
sprung
on
me
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
won
the
toss
and
ca
take
my
orders
from
you
old
chap
can
i
the
other
in
his
turn
grew
a
little
warm
all
right
i
spoken
i
think
you
rather
a
fool
to
be
so
obstinate
it
is
as
if
a
nervous
old
woman
was
talking
to
you
but
you
go
your
own
way
it
does
matter
a
button
to
me
and
i
only
made
it
a
favor
for
somebody
else
sake
we
leave
it
at
that
then
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
key
and
your
revolver
too
i
have
got
mine
here
henry
hesitated
the
key
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
it
is
a
matter
of
honor
lennox
said
the
sailor
the
other
handed
over
the
key
on
this
speech
and
prepared
to
go
i
get
the
revolver
he
said
thanks
look
me
up
in
the
morning
if
you
awake
first
added
may
but
the
other
did
not
answer
he
let
tom
precede
him
and
then
turned
out
the
lights
other
lights
he
also
extinguished
as
they
left
the
hall
and
ascended
the
stairs
the
younger
pride
was
struggling
for
mastery
but
he
conquered
it
and
spoke
again
i
wish
to
heaven
you
could
see
it
from
another
point
of
view
than
your
own
tom
i
have
no
point
of
view
you
rather
exasperating
and
do
seem
to
understand
that
even
if
i
might
have
changed
my
mind
before
impossible
now
that
really
only
a
foolish
sort
of
pride
if
i
chose
my
words
clumsily
you
did
the
devil
and
all
his
angels
would
make
me
climb
down
now
the
younger
left
him
and
returned
in
a
minute
or
two
with
the
revolver
he
said
old
boy
thank
you
loaded
in
all
the
chambers
funny
you
should
want
it
take
it
back
then
but
henry
did
not
answer
and
they
parted
each
sought
his
own
bedroom
and
while
lennox
retired
at
once
and
might
have
been
expected
to
pass
a
night
more
mentally
peaceful
than
the
other
in
reality
it
was
not
so
the
younger
slept
ill
while
may
suffered
no
emotion
but
annoyance
he
was
contemptuous
of
henry
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
taken
a
rather
mean
and
unsporting
line
nor
did
he
believe
for
a
moment
that
he
was
honest
lennox
had
a
modern
mind
he
had
been
through
the
furnace
of
war
he
had
received
a
education
it
seemed
impossible
to
imagine
that
he
spoke
the
truth
or
that
his
sudden
suspicion
of
real
perils
beyond
human
power
to
combat
could
be
anything
but
a
spiteful
attempt
to
put
may
off
after
he
himself
had
lost
the
toss
yet
that
seemed
unlike
a
gentleman
then
the
allusion
to
mary
perturbed
the
sailor
he
could
not
quarrel
with
the
words
but
he
resented
the
advice
seeing
what
it
was
based
upon
his
anger
lessened
swiftly
however
and
before
he
started
his
adventure
he
had
dismissed
henry
from
his
mind
he
put
on
pyjamas
and
a
took
a
candle
a
his
watch
and
the
loaded
revolver
then
he
walked
quietly
down
the
corridor
to
the
grey
room
on
reaching
it
his
usual
good
temper
returned
and
he
found
himself
entirely
happy
and
contented
he
unlocked
the
forbidden
entrance
set
his
candle
by
the
bed
and
locked
the
door
again
from
inside
he
rolled
up
his
for
a
pillow
and
placed
his
watch
and
revolver
and
candle
at
his
hand
on
a
chair
a
few
broken
reflections
drifted
through
his
mind
as
he
yawned
and
prepared
to
sleep
his
brain
brought
up
events
of
the
day
a
missed
shot
a
good
shot
lunch
under
a
haystack
with
mary
and
niece
she
was
smart
and
showy
and
slangy
cheap
every
way
compared
with
mary
what
would
his
wife
think
if
she
knew
he
was
so
near
come
to
him
for
certain
he
cordially
hoped
that
he
might
not
be
recalled
to
his
ship
but
there
was
a
possibility
of
it
it
would
be
rather
a
lark
to
show
the
governor
over
the
indomitable
she
was
a
ship
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
navy
still
funny
that
the
italian
roof
of
the
grey
room
looked
like
a
dome
though
it
was
really
flat
a
cunning
trick
of
perspective
it
was
a
still
and
silent
night
moonless
very
dark
and
very
tranquil
he
went
to
the
window
to
throw
it
open
only
a
solitary
being
waked
long
that
night
at
chadlands
and
only
a
solitary
mind
suffered
tribulation
but
into
the
small
hours
henry
lennox
endured
the
companionship
of
disquiet
thoughts
he
could
not
sleep
and
his
brain
clear
enough
retraced
no
passage
from
the
past
day
indeed
the
events
of
the
day
had
sunk
into
remote
time
he
was
only
concerned
with
the
present
and
he
wondered
while
he
worried
that
he
should
be
worrying
yet
a
proleptic
instinct
made
him
look
forward
he
had
neither
lied
nor
exaggerated
to
may
from
the
moment
of
losing
the
toss
he
honestly
experienced
a
strong
subjective
impression
of
danger
arising
out
of
the
proposed
attack
on
the
mysteries
of
the
grey
room
it
was
indeed
that
consciousness
of
greater
possibilities
in
the
adventure
than
may
admitted
or
imagined
which
made
lennox
so
insistent
looking
back
he
perceived
many
things
and
chiefly
that
he
had
taken
a
wrong
line
and
approached
mary
husband
from
a
fatal
angle
too
late
he
recognized
his
error
it
was
inevitable
that
a
hint
of
suspected
danger
would
confirm
the
sailor
in
his
resolution
and
that
such
a
hint
should
follow
the
spin
of
the
coin
against
lennox
and
be
accompanied
by
the
assurance
that
had
he
won
henry
would
have
proceeded
despite
his
intuitions
to
do
what
he
now
begged
tom
not
to
do
that
was
a
piece
of
clumsy
work
which
he
deeply
regretted
at
the
hour
when
his
own
physical
forces
were
lowest
his
errors
of
diplomacy
forced
themselves
upon
his
mind
he
wasted
much
time
as
all
men
do
upon
their
beds
in
anticipating
in
considering
what
is
going
to
happen
or
what
is
not
in
weighing
their
own
future
words
and
deeds
given
a
variety
of
contingencies
for
reason
which
at
first
kept
him
despite
his
disquiet
in
the
region
of
the
rational
grew
weaker
with
henry
as
the
night
advanced
the
shadow
of
trouble
deepened
as
his
weary
wits
lost
their
balance
to
combat
it
the
premonition
was
as
formless
and
amorphous
as
a
cloud
and
though
he
could
not
see
any
shape
to
his
fear
or
define
its
limitations
it
grew
darker
ere
he
slept
he
considered
what
might
happen
and
putting
aside
any
lesser
disaster
tried
to
imagine
what
the
morning
would
bring
if
may
actually
succumbed
for
the
moment
the
size
of
such
an
imaginary
disaster
served
curiously
to
lessen
his
uneasiness
pushed
to
extremities
the
idea
became
merely
absurd
he
won
a
sort
of
comfort
from
such
an
outrageous
proposition
because
it
brought
him
back
to
the
solid
ground
of
reason
and
the
assurance
that
some
things
simply
do
not
happen
from
this
extravagant
summit
of
horror
his
fears
gradually
receded
such
a
waking
nightmare
even
quieted
his
nerves
when
it
was
past
for
if
a
possibility
presents
a
ludicrous
side
then
its
horror
must
diminish
by
so
much
moreover
henry
told
himself
that
if
the
threat
of
a
disaster
so
absolute
could
really
be
felt
by
him
it
was
his
duty
to
rise
at
once
intervene
and
if
necessary
summon
his
uncle
and
force
may
to
leave
the
grey
room
immediately
this
idea
amused
him
again
and
offered
another
jest
the
tragedy
really
resolved
into
jests
he
found
himself
smiling
at
the
picture
of
may
being
treated
like
a
disobedient
schoolboy
but
if
that
happened
and
tom
was
proclaimed
the
sinner
what
must
be
henry
own
fate
to
win
the
reputation
of
an
unsportsmanlike
sneak
in
mary
opinion
as
well
as
tom
he
certainly
could
call
upon
nobody
to
help
him
now
but
he
might
go
and
look
up
may
himself
that
would
be
very
sharply
resented
however
he
travelled
round
and
round
in
circles
then
asked
himself
what
he
would
do
and
say
if
anything
happened
to
tom
nothing
of
course
fatal
but
something
perhaps
so
grave
that
may
himself
would
be
unable
to
explain
it
in
that
case
henry
could
only
state
facts
exactly
as
they
had
occurred
but
there
would
be
a
deuce
of
a
muddle
if
he
had
to
make
statements
and
describe
the
exact
sequence
of
recent
incidents
already
he
forgot
the
exact
sequence
it
seemed
ages
since
he
parted
from
may
he
broke
off
there
rose
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
lighted
a
cigarette
he
shook
himself
into
wakefulness
condemned
himself
for
this
debauch
of
thinking
found
the
time
to
be
three
and
brushed
the
whole
cobweb
tangle
from
his
mind
he
knew
that
sudden
warmth
after
cold
will
often
induce
sleep
a
fact
proved
by
incidents
of
his
campaigns
so
he
trudged
up
and
down
and
opened
his
window
and
let
the
cool
breath
of
the
night
chill
his
forehead
and
breast
for
five
minutes
this
action
calmed
him
and
he
headed
himself
off
from
returning
to
the
subject
he
felt
that
mental
dread
and
discomfort
were
only
waiting
to
break
out
again
but
he
smothered
them
returned
to
bed
and
succeeded
in
keeping
his
mind
on
matter
until
he
fell
asleep
he
woke
again
before
he
was
called
rose
and
went
to
his
bath
he
took
it
cold
and
it
refreshed
him
and
cleared
his
head
for
he
had
a
headache
everything
was
changed
and
the
phantoms
of
his
imagination
remained
only
as
memories
to
be
laughed
at
he
no
longer
felt
alarm
or
anxiety
he
dressed
presently
and
guessing
that
tom
always
the
first
to
rise
might
already
be
out
of
doors
he
strolled
on
to
the
terrace
presently
to
meet
him
there
already
he
speculated
whether
an
apology
was
due
from
him
to
may
or
whether
he
might
himself
expect
one
it
did
matter
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
tom
was
all
right
now
and
that
was
the
only
thing
that
signified
chapter
iii
at
the
oriel
chadlands
sprang
into
existence
when
the
manor
houses
of
england
save
for
the
persistence
of
occasional
embattled
parapets
and
other
warlike
survivals
of
unrestful
days
now
past
had
obeyed
the
laws
of
architectural
evolution
and
begun
to
approach
a
future
of
cleanliness
and
comfort
rising
to
luxury
hitherto
unknown
the
development
of
this
ancient
mass
was
displayed
in
plan
as
much
as
in
elevation
and
at
its
date
the
great
mansion
had
stood
for
the
last
word
of
perfection
when
men
thought
on
large
lines
and
the
conditions
of
labour
made
possible
achievements
now
seldom
within
the
power
of
a
private
purse
much
had
since
been
done
but
the
main
architectural
features
were
preserved
though
the
interior
of
the
great
house
was
transformed
the
manor
of
chadlands
extended
to
some
fifty
thousand
acres
lying
in
a
river
valley
between
the
heights
of
haldon
on
the
east
and
the
frontiers
of
dartmoor
westerly
the
little
township
was
connected
by
a
branch
with
the
great
western
railway
and
the
station
lay
five
miles
from
the
manor
house
no
more
perfect
parklands
albeit
on
a
modest
scale
existed
in
south
devon
and
the
views
of
the
surrounding
heights
and
great
vale
opening
from
the
estate
caused
pleasure
alike
to
those
contented
with
obvious
beauty
and
the
small
number
of
spectators
who
understood
the
significance
of
what
constitutes
really
distinguished
landscape
eastward
long
slopes
of
herbage
and
drifts
of
azaleas

glorious
harmony
of
gold
scarlet
and
orange

sloped
upwards
to
larch
woods
while
the
gardens
of
pleasure
watered
by
a
little
trout
stream
spread
beneath
the

and
behind
it
rose

sir
walter
lennox
had
devoted
himself
to
the
sporting
side
of
the
estate
and
had
made
it
famous
in
this
respect
his
father
less
interested
in
shooting
and
hunting
had
devoted
time
and
means
to
the
flower
gardens
and
rendered
them
as
rich
as
was
possible
in
his
day
while
earlier
yet

walter
grandfather
had
been
more
concerned
for
the
interior
and
had
done
much
to

and
beautify

terrace

between

balustrade

from
the
gardens
spreading
at
a
lower
level
here
walked
henry
lennox
and
sought
tom
may
it
was
now
past
eight
on
sunday
morning
and
he
found
himself
alone
the
sun
breaking
through
heaviness
of
morning
clouds
had
risen
clear
of
haldon
hills
and
cast
a
radiance
still
dimmed
by
vapour
over
the
glow
of
the
autumn
trees
subdued
sounds
of
birds
came
from
the
glades
below
and
far
distant
from
the
scrub
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
pheasants
were
crowing
the
morning
sparkled
and
in
a
scene
so
fair
henry
found
his
spirits
rise
already
the
interview
with
mary
husband
on
the
preceding
night
seemed
remote
and
unreal
he
was
however
conscious
that
he
had
made
an
ass
of
himself
but
he
did
not
much
mind
for
it
could
not
be
said
that
may
had
shone
either
he
called
him
and
for
reply
an
old
spaniel
emerged
from
beneath
climbed
a
flight
of
broad
steps
that
ascended
to
the
terrace
and
paddled
up
to
henry
wagging
his
tail
he
was
a
very
ancient
hero
whose
record
among
the
wild
duck
still
remained
a
worthy
memory
and
won
him
honour
in
his
declining
days
the
age
of
prince
remained
doubtful
but
he
was
decrepit
now
gone
in
the
hams
and
suffering
from
cataract
of
both
eyes
a
disease
to
which
it
is
impossible
to
minister
in
a
dog
but
his
life
was
good
to
him
he
still
got
about
slept
in
the
sun
and
shared
the
best
his
master
dish
could
offer
sir
walter
adored
him
and
immediately
felt
uneasy
if
the
creature
did
not
appear
when
summoned
often
had
he
been
invisible
too
long
his
master
would
wander
whistling
round
his
haunts
then
he
would
find
him
or
be
himself
found
and
feel
easy
again
prince
went
in
to
the
open
window
of
the
while
henry
moved
by
a
thought
walked
round
the
eastern
angle
of
the
house
and
looked
up
at
the
oriel
window
of
the
grey
room
where
it
hung
aloft
on
the
side
of
the
wall
like
a
brilliant
bubble
and
flashed
with
the
sunshine
that
now
irradiated
the
casement
to
his
surprise
he
saw
the
window
was
thrown
open
and
that
may
still
in
his
pyjamas
knelt
on
the
cushioned
recess
within
and
looked
out
at
the
morning
good
lord
old
chap
he
cried
need
ask
you
if
you
have
slept
it
nearly
nine
but
the
other
made
no
response
whatever
he
continued
to
gaze
far
away
over
henry
head
at
the
sunrise
while
the
morning
breeze
moved
his
dark
hair
tom
wake
up
shouted
lennox
again
but
still
the
other
did
not
move
a
muscle
then
henry
noticed
that
he
was
unusually
pale
and
something
about
his
unwinking
eyes
also
seemed
foreign
to
an
intelligent
expression
they
were
set
and
no
movement
of
light
played
upon
them
it
seemed
that
the
watcher
was
in
a
trance
henry
felt
his
heart
jump
and
a
sensation
of
alarm
sharpened
his
thought
for
him
the
morning
was
suddenly
transformed
and
fearing
an
evil
thing
had
indeed
befallen
the
other
he
turned
to
the
terrace
and
entered
the
from
it
the
time
was
now
five
minutes
to
nine
and
as
unfailing
punctuality
had
ever
been
a
foible
of
sir
walter
his
guests
usually
respected
it
most
of
them
were
already
assembled
and
mary
may
who
was
just
stepping
into
the
garden
asked
henry
if
he
had
seen
her
husband
he
always
the
first
to
get
up
and
the
last
to
go
to
bed
she
said
bidding
her
but
not
answering
her
question
the
young
man
hastened
through
the
room
and
ascended
to
the
corridor
beneath
ernest
travers
a
being
of
fussy
temperament
with
a
heart
of
gold
spoke
to
colonel
vane
travers
was
clad
in
sunday
black
for
he
respected
tradition
forgive
me
wo
you
but
this
is
your
first
visit
and
you
do
look
much
like
church
must
we
go
to
church
too
asked
the
colonel
blankly
he
was
still
a
year
under
forty
but
had
achieved
distinction
in
the
war
there
is
no
about
it
but
sir
walter
would
appreciate
the
effort
on
your
part
he
likes
his
guests
to
go
he
is
one
of
those
men
who
are
a
light
to
this
generation
an
ancient
light
if
you
like
but
a
shining
one
he
loves
sound
maxims
you
may
say
he
runs
his
life
on
sound
maxims
he
lives
charitably
with
all
men
and
it
puzzles
him
as
it
puzzles
me
to
understand
the
growing
doubt
the
class
prejudice
nay
class
hatred
the
failure
of
trust
and
the
increasing
tension
and
uneasiness
between
employer
and
employed
he
and
i
are
agreed
that
the
tribulations
of
the
present
time
can
be
traced
to
two
disasters
only
the
lack
of
goodwill
as
shown
in
the
proletariat
whose
leaders
teach
them
to
respect
nobody
and
the
weakening
hold
of
religion
as
also
revealed
in
the
proletariat
now
to
combat
these
things
and
set
a
good
example
is
our
duty
nay
our
privilege
do
you
think
so
such
a
lecture
on
an
empty
stomach
depressed
the
colonel
he
looked
uneasy
and
anxious
i
come
of
course
if
he
like
it
but
i
afraid
i
shared
my
dread
of
church
parade
though
our
padre
was
a
merciful
being
on
the
whole
and
fairly
sensible
overhead
henry
had
tried
the
door
of
the
grey
room
and
found
it
locked
as
he
did
so
the
gong
sounded
for
breakfast
masters
always
performed
upon
it
first
he
woke
a
preliminary
whisper
of
the
great
bronze
disc
then
deepened
the
note
to
a
genial
and
mellow
roar
and
finally
calmed
it
down
again
until
it
faded
gently
into
silence
he
spoke
of
the
gong
as
a
musical
instrument
and
declared
the
art
of
sounding
it
was
a
gift
that
few
men
could
acquire
neither
movement
nor
response
rewarded
the
summons
of
lennox
and
now
in
genuine
alarm
he
went
below
again
stopped
fred
caunter
the
footman
and
asked
him
to
call
out
sir
walter
fred
waited
until
his
master
had
said
a
brief
grace
before
meat
then
he
stepped
to
his
side
and
explained
that
his
nephew
desired
to
see
him
good
patience
what
the
matter
asked
the
old
man
as
he
rose
and
joined
henry
in
the
hall
then
his
nephew
spoke
and
indicated
his
alarm
he
stammered
a
little
but
strove
to
keep
calm
and
state
facts
clearly
it
like
this
i
afraid
you
be
rather
savage
but
i
ca
talk
now
tom
and
i
had
a
yarn
when
you
gone
to
bed
and
he
was
awfully
keen
to
spend
the
night
in
the
grey
room
i
did
not
wish
it
i
know
we
were
wrong
but
we
were
both
death
on
it
and
we
tossed
up
and
he
won
where
is
he
up
there
now
looking
out
of
the
window
i
called
him
and
made
a
row
at
the
door
but
he
does
answer
he
locked
himself
in
apparently
what
have
you
done
henry
we
must
get
to
him
instantly
tell
caunter
no
i
will
do
breathe
a
syllable
of
this
to
anybody
unless
necessity
arises
do
tell
mary
sir
walter
beckoned
the
footman
bade
him
get
some
tools
and
ascend
quickly
to
the
grey
room
he
then
went
up
beside
his
nephew
while
fred
bristling
with
excitement
hastened
to
the
toolroom
he
was
a
handy
man
had
been
at
sea
during
the
war
and
now
returned
to
his
old
employment
his
slow
brain
moved
backwards
and
he
remembered
that
this
was
a
task
he
had
already
performed
ten
or
more
years
before
then
the
chamber
had
revealed
a
dead
woman
who
was
in
it
now
caunter
guessed
readily
enough
lennox
spoke
to
his
uncle
as
they
approached
the
locked
door
it
was
only
a
lark
just
to
clear
the
room
of
its
bad
character
and
have
a
laugh
at
your
expense
this
morning
but
i
afraid
ill
fainted
or
something
he
turned
in
about
one
i
was
rather
bothered
and
could
explain
to
myself
why
but
do
chatter
answered
the
other
you
have
both
done
a
very
wrong
thing
and
should
have
respected
my
wishes
at
the
door
he
called
loudly
let
us
in
at
once
tom
please
i
am
much
annoyed
if
this
is
a
jest
it
has
gone
far
enough
and
too
far
i
blame
you
severely
but
none
replied
absolute
silence
held
the
grey
room
then
came
the
footman
with
a
frail
of
tools
the
task
could
not
be
performed
in
a
moment
and
sir
walter
desirous
above
all
things
to
create
no
uneasiness
at
the
determined
to
go
down
again
but
he
was
too
late
for
his
daughter
had
already
suspected
something
she
was
not
anxious
but
puzzled
that
her
husband
tarried
she
came
up
the
stairs
with
a
letter
i
going
to
find
tom
she
said
it
not
like
him
to
be
so
lazy
here
a
letter
from
the
ship
and
i
awfully
afraid
he
may
have
to
go
back
mary
said
her
father
come
here
a
moment
he
drew
her
under
a
great
window
which
threw
light
into
the
corridor
you
must
summon
your
nerve
and
pluck
my
girl
i
very
much
afraid
that
something
has
gone
amiss
with
tom
i
know
nothing
yet
but
last
night
it
seems
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
he
and
henry
determined
that
one
of
them
should
sleep
in
the
grey
room
father
was
he
there
and
i
so
near
him
sleeping
in
the
very
next
room
he
was
there
and
is
there
he
is
not
well
henry
saw
him
looking
out
of
the
window
five
minutes
ago
but
he
was
i
fear
unconscious
let
me
go
to
him
she
said
i
will
do
so
first
it
will
be
wiser
run
down
and
ask
ernest
to
join
me
do
not
be
alarmed
i
dare
say
it
is
nothing
at
all
her
habit
of
obedience
prompted
her
to
do
as
he
desired
instantly
but
she
descended
like
lightning
called
travers
and
returned
with
him
i
will
ask
you
to
come
in
with
me
ernest
explained
sir
walter
my
slept
in
the
grey
room
last
night
and
he
does
not
respond
to
our
calls
this
morning
the
door
is
locked
and
we
are
breaking
it
open
but
you
expressly
refused
him
permission
to
do
so
walter
i
did
you
heard
me
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
is
a
very
good
motto
but
young
men
will
be
young
men
i
hope
however
nothing
serious
he
stopped
for
caunter
had
forced
the
door
and
burst
it
inward
with
a
crash
during
the
moment
silence
that
followed
they
heard
the
key
spring
into
the
room
and
strike
the
wainscot
the
place
was
flooded
with
sunshine
and
seemed
to
welcome
them
with
genial
light
and
attractive
art
the
furniture
revealed
its
rich
grain
and
beautiful
modelling
the
cherubs
carved
on
the
great
chairs
seemed
to
dance
where
the
light
flashed
on
their
little
rounded
limbs
the
silvery
walls
were
bright
and
the
huge
roses
that
tumbled
over
them
appeared
to
revive
and
display
their
original
color
at
the
touch
of
the
sun
on
a
chair
beside
the
bed
stood
an
extinguished
candle
tom
watch
and
henry
revolver
the
sailor
was
still
folded
where
he
had
placed
it
his
rug
was
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
himself
knelt
in
the
recess
at
the
open
window
upon
the
settee
that
ran
beneath
his
position
was
natural
one
arm
held
the
and
steadied
him
and
his
back
was
turned
to
sir
walter
and
travers
who
first
entered
the
room
henry
held
mary
back
and
implored
her
to
wait
a
moment
but
she
shook
off
his
hand
and
followed
her
father
sir
walter
it
was
who
approached
tom
and
grasped
his
arm
in
so
doing
he
disturbed
the
balance
of
the
body
which
fell
back
and
was
caught
by
the
two
men
its
weight
bore
ernest
travers
to
the
ground
but
henry
was
in
time
to
save
both
the
quick
and
the
dead
for
tom
may
had
expired
many
hours
before
his
face
was
of
an
ivory
whiteness
his
mouth
closed
no
sign
of
fear
but
rather
a
profound
astonishment
sat
upon
his
features
his
eyes
were
opened
and
dim
in
them
too
was
frozen
a
sort
of
speechless
amazement
how
long
he
had
been
dead
they
knew
not
but
none
were
in
doubt
of
the
fact
his
wife
too
perceived
it
she
went
to
where
he
now
lay
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
fainted
others
were
moving
outside
and
the
murmur
of
voices
reached
the
grey
room
it
was
one
of
those
tragic
situations
when
everybody
desires
to
be
of
service
and
when
and
people
are
often
hurt
unintentionally
and
never
forget
it
putting
fancied
affronts
before
the
incidents
that
caused
them
the
man
lay
dead
and
his
wife
unconscious
upon
his
body
sir
walter
rose
to
the
occasion
as
best
he
might
issued
orders
and
begged
all
who
heard
him
to
obey
without
question
he
and
his
friend
travers
lifted
mary
and
carried
her
to
her
room
it
was
her
nursery
of
old
here
they
put
her
on
her
bed
and
sent
caunter
for
travers
and
mary
old
servant
jane
bond
she
had
recovered
consciousness
before
the
women
reached
her
then
they
returned
to
the
dead
and
the
master
of
chadlands
urged
those
standing
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
corridor
to
go
back
to
their
breakfast
and
their
duties
you
can
do
no
good
he
said
i
will
only
ask
vane
to
help
us
spoke
while
the
colonel
came
forward
forgive
me
sir
walter
but
if
it
is
anything
psychical
i
ask
as
a
member
for
heaven
sake
do
as
i
wish
returned
the
other
my
is
dead
what
more
there
is
to
know
you
hear
later
i
want
vane
because
he
is
a
powerful
man
and
can
help
henry
and
my
butler
we
have
to
carry
he
broke
off
dead
gasped
the
visitor
then
he
hastened
downstairs
presently
they
lifted
the
sailor
among
them
and
got
him
to
his
own
room
they
could
not
dispose
him
in
a
comely
position
a
fact
that
specially
troubled
sir
walter
and
masters
doubted
not
that
the
doctor
would
be
able
to
do
it
henry
lennox
started
as
swiftly
as
possible
for
the
house
of
the
physician
four
miles
off
he
took
a
small
did
the
journey
along
empty
roads
in
twelve
minutes
and
was
back
again
with
mannering
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
people
whose
visit
of
pleasure
was
thus
painfully
brought
to
a
close
moved
about
whispering
on
the
terrace
they
had
as
yet
heard
no
details
and
were
considering
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
get
off
at
once
or
necessary
to
wait
until
the
morrow
their
natural
desire
was
to
depart
since
they
could
not
be
of
any
service
to
the
stricken
household
but
no
facilities
existed
on
sunday
they
walked
about
in
little
groups
one
or
two
desiring
to
smoke
but
feeling
that
to
do
so
would
appear
callous
descended
into
the
seclusion
of
the
garden
then
ernest
travers
joined
them
he
was
important
but
could
only
tell
them
that
may
had
disobeyed
his
slept
in
the
grey
room
and
died
there
he
gave
them
details
and
declared
that
in
his
opinion
it
would
be
unseemly
to
attempt
to
leave
until
the
following
day
sir
walter
would
feel
it
he
said
he
is
bearing
up
well
he
will
lunch
with
us
my
wife
tells
me
that
mary
may
is
very
sadly
that
is
natural
an
awful
blow
i
find
myself
incapable
of
grasping
it
to
think
of
so
much
boyish
good
spirits
and
such
vitality
extinguished
in
this
way
can
we
do
anything
on
earth
for
them
asked
millicent
nothing
nothing
if
i
may
advise
i
think
we
had
all
better
go
to
church
by
so
doing
we
get
out
of
the
way
for
a
time
and
please
dear
sir
walter
i
shall
certainly
go
they
greeted
the
suggestion
indeed
clutched
at
it
their
bewildered
minds
welcomed
action
they
were
hushed
and
perturbed
death
crashing
in
upon
them
thus
left
them
more
than
uncomfortable
some
at
the
bottom
of
their
souls
felt
almost
indignant
that
an
event
so
horrible
should
have
disturbed
the
level
tenor
of
their
lives
they
shared
the
most
profound
sympathy
for
the
sufferers
as
well
as
for
themselves
some
discovered
that
their
own
physical
bodies
were
upset
too
and
felt
surprised
at
the
depth
of
their
emotions
it
is
as
if
it
were
natural
felix
persisted
imagine
that
for
a
moment
it
too
creepy
i
ca
believe
it
declared
his
niece
she
was
incapable
of
suffering
much
for
anybody
and
her
excitement
had
a
flavour
not
wholly
bitter
she
saw
herself
describing
these
events
at
other
house
parties
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
that
she
was
enjoying
herself
still
she
knew
nobody
at
chadlands
very
well
it
was
her
first
visit
and
adventures
are
after
all
adventures
her
uncle
discussed
the
psychic
significance
of
the
tragedy
and
gave
instances
of
similar
events
one
or
two
listened
to
him
for
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
there
was
a
general
sensation
of
blankness
they
were
all
thrown
life
had
let
them
down
under
the
circumstances
to
most
of
them
it
seemed
an
excellent
idea
to
go
to
church
vane
joined
them
presently
he
was
able
to
give
them
many
details
and
excite
their
interest
they
crowded
round
him
and
he
spoke
nakedly
death
was
nothing
to
him
he
had
seen
so
much
they
heard
the
motor
return
with
mannering
we
so
out
of
it
said
mr
miles
handford
a
stout
man
from
yorkshire
a
wealthy
landowner
and
sportsman
he
was
unaccustomed
to
be
out
of
anything
in
his
environment
and
he
showed
actual
irritation
thank
heaven
we
are
i
should
think
answered
another
and
the
first
speaker
frowned
at
him
ernest
travers
joined
them
presently
he
had
put
on
a
black
tie
and
wore
black
gloves
and
a
silk
hat
if
you
accompany
me
he
said
i
can
show
you
the
short
way
by
a
field
path
it
cuts
off
half
a
mile
i
have
told
sir
walter
we
all
go
to
church
and
he
asked
me
if
we
would
like
the
motors
but
i
felt
the
day
being
fine
you
would
agree
with
me
that
we
might
walk
he
is
terribly
crushed
but
taking
it
like
the
man
he
is
miles
handford
and
followed
the
church
party
in
the
rear
and
relieved
their
minds
by
criticizing
travers
officious
ass
said
the
stout
man
a
typical
touch
that
black
tie
a
person
would
have
felt
this
appalling
tragedy
far
too
much
to
think
of
such
a
trifle
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
the
brute
again
it
seems
too
grotesque
marching
to
church
like
a
lot
of
children
because
he
tells
us
to
do
so
murmured
i
do
want
to
go
i
only
want
distraction
in
fact
i
do
think
i
shall
go
added
handford
but
a
woman
urged
him
to
do
so
sir
walter
would
like
it
she
said
it
all
very
sad
and
very
exasperating
indeed
declared
the
yorkshireman
and
it
shows
if
that
wanted
showing
that
there
far
far
less
consideration
among
young
men
for
their
elders
than
there
used
to
be
in
my
young
days
if
my
had
told
me
not
to
do
a
thing
the
very
wish
to
do
it
would
have
disappeared
at
once
sir
walter
was
as
clear
as
need
be
added
felix
we
all
heard
him
then
the
young
fool
heaven
forgive
him
behind
everybody
back
goes
and
plays
with
fire
in
this
insane
way
the
selfishness
just
look
at
the
inconvenience
the
upset
the
suffering
to
his
relations
and
the
worry
for
all
of
us
all
our
plans
must
be
altered
everything
upset
life
for
the
moment
turned
upside
down
a
woman
heart
broken
very
likely
and
all
for
a
piece
of
disobedient
folly
such
things
make
one
out
of
tune
with
providence
they
ought
to
happen
they
do
happen
in
yorkshire
devonshire
appears
to
be
a
slacker
county
it
the
air
i
should
wonder
education
and
law
and
order
and
the
discipline
inculcated
in
the
navy
ought
to
have
prevented
this
continued
who
ever
heard
of
a
sailor
disobeying
except
nelson
he
paid
poor
fellow
said
his
niece
who
walked
beside
him
we
have
all
paid
declared
the
north
countryman
we
have
all
paid
the
price
and
the
price
has
been
a
great
deal
of
suffering
and
discomfort
and
stress
of
mind
that
we
ought
not
have
been
called
upon
to
endure
one
resents
such
things
in
a
stable
world
well
i
not
going
to
church
anyway
i
must
smoke
for
my
nerves
i
a
psychic
myself
and
i
react
to
a
thing
of
this
sort
replied
from
a
distant
stile
between
two
fields
travers
some
hundred
yards
ahead
was
waving
directions
and
pointing
to
the
left
go
to
jericho
snapped
handford
but
not
loud
enough
for
ernest
travers
to
hear
him
a
little
ring
of
bells
throbbed
thin
music
it
rose
and
fell
on
the
easterly
breeze
and
a
squat
grey
tower
over
which
floated
a
white
ensign
on
a
flagstaff
appeared
upon
a
little
knoll
of
trees
in
the
midst
of
the
village
of
chadlands
presently
the
bells
stopped
and
the
flag
was
brought
down
to
travers
had
reached
the
church
a
maddening
sort
of
man
said
miles
handford
who
marked
these
phenomena
be
sure
sir
walter
never
told
him
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
he
has
taken
it
upon
himself
a
theatrical
mind
if
i
were
the
vicar
elsewhere
mannering
heard
what
henry
lennox
could
tell
him
as
they
returned
to
the
manor
house
together
he
displayed
very
deep
concern
combined
with
professional
interest
he
recalled
the
story
that
sir
walter
had
related
on
the
previous
night
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
a
perfectly
healthy
little
woman
and
it
will
be
the
same
here
as
sure
as
i
alive
he
said
to
think
we
shot
side
by
side
yesterday
and
i
remarked
his
fine
physique
and
wonderful
high
spirits
a
big
tough
fellow
how
poor
mary
she
is
pretty
bad
but
keeping
her
nerve
as
she
would
be
sure
to
do
declared
the
other
sir
walter
was
with
his
daughter
when
mannering
arrived
the
doctor
had
been
a
crony
of
the
elder
for
many
years
he
was
about
the
average
of
a
country
physician
a
practical
man
who
loved
his
profession
loved
sport
and
professed
conservative
principles
experience
stood
in
place
of
high
qualifications
but
he
kept
in
touch
with
medical
progress
to
the
extent
of
reading
about
it
and
availing
himself
of
improved
methods
and
preparations
when
opportunity
offered
he
examined
the
dead
man
very
carefully
indicated
how
his
posture
might
be
rendered
more
normal
and
satisfied
himself
that
human
power
was
incapable
of
restoring
the
vanished
life
he
could
discover
no
visible
indication
of
violence
and
no
apparent
excuse
for
tom
may
sudden
end
he
listened
with
attention
to
the
little
that
henry
lennox
could
tell
him
and
then
went
to
see
mary
may
and
her
father
the
young
wife
had
grown
more
collected
but
she
was
dazed
rather
than
reconciled
to
her
fate
her
mind
had
not
yet
absorbed
the
full
extent
of
her
sorrow
she
talked
incessantly
and
dwelt
on
trivialities
as
people
will
under
a
weight
of
events
too
large
to
measure
or
discuss
i
am
going
to
write
to
tom
father
she
said
this
will
be
an
awful
blow
to
him
he
was
wrapped
up
in
tom
and
to
think
that
i
was
troubling
about
his
letter
he
will
never
see
the
sea
he
loved
so
much
again
he
always
hated
that
verse
in
the
bible
that
says
there
will
be
no
more
sea
i
was
asleep
so
near
him
last
night
yet
i
never
heard
him
cry
out
or
anything
mannering
talked
gently
to
her
be
sure
he
did
not
cry
out
he
felt
no
pain
no
shock
i
am
sure
of
that
to
die
is
no
hardship
to
the
dead
remember
he
is
at
peace
mary
you
must
come
and
see
him
presently
your
father
will
call
you
soon
there
is
just
a
look
of
wonder
in
his
face
no
fear
no
suffering
keep
that
in
mind
he
could
not
have
felt
fear
he
knew
of
nothing
that
a
brave
man
might
fear
except
doing
wrong
nobody
knows
how
good
he
was
but
me
his
father
loved
him
fiercely
passionately
but
he
never
knew
how
good
he
was
because
tom
did
not
think
quite
like
old
may
i
must
write
and
say
that
tom
is
dangerously
ill
and
can
not
recover
that
will
break
it
to
him
tom
was
the
only
earthly
affection
he
had
it
will
be
terrible
when
he
comes
they
left
her
and
after
they
had
gone
she
rose
fell
on
her
knees
and
so
remained
motionless
and
tearless
for
a
long
time
through
her
own
desolation
as
yet
unrealized
there
still
persisted
the
thought
of
her
husband
father
it
seemed
that
her
mind
could
dwell
on
his
isolation
while
powerless
to
present
the
truth
of
her
husband
death
to
her
by
some
strange
mental
operation
not
unbeneficent
she
saw
his
grief
more
vividly
than
as
yet
she
felt
her
own
she
rose
presently
to
wait
the
call
and
went
to
her
desk
in
the
window
then
she
wrote
a
letter
to
her
and
pictured
his
ministering
at
that
moment
to
his
church
her
inclination
was
to
soften
the
blow
yet
she
knew
that
could
only
be
a
cruel
kindness
she
told
him
therefore
that
his
son
must
die
then
she
remembered
that
he
was
so
near
a
telegram
must
go
rather
than
a
letter
and
he
would
be
at
chadlands
before
nightfall
she
destroyed
her
letter
and
set
about
a
telegram
jane
bond
came
in
and
she
asked
her
to
dispatch
the
telegram
as
quickly
as
possible
her
old
nurse
an
elderly
spinster
to
whom
mary
was
the
first
consideration
in
existence
had
brought
her
a
cup
of
soup
and
some
toast
it
had
seemed
to
jane
the
right
thing
to
do
mary
thanked
her
and
drank
a
little
she
passed
through
a
mental
phase
as
of
dreaming
a
sensation
familiar
in
sleep
but
she
knew
that
this
was
not
a
sleeping
but
a
waking
experience
she
waited
for
her
father
yet
dreaded
to
hear
him
return
she
thought
of
human
footsteps
and
the
difference
between
them
she
remembered
that
she
would
never
hear
long
stride
again
it
often
broke
into
a
run
she
remembered
as
he
approached
her
and
she
would
often
run
toward
him
too
to
banish
the
space
that
separated
them
she
blamed
herself
bitterly
that
she
had
decreed
to
sleep
in
her
old
nursery
she
had
loved
it
so
and
the
small
bed
that
had
held
her
from
childhood
yet
if
she
had
slept
with
him
this
might
not
have
happened
to
think
that
only
a
wall
separated
us
she
kept
saying
to
herself
and
i
sleeping
and
dreaming
of
him
and
he
dying
only
a
few
yards
away
death
was
no
disaster
for
tom
so
the
doctor
had
said
what
worthless
wisdom
and
perhaps
not
even
wisdom
who
knows
what
a
disaster
death
may
be
and
who
would
ever
know
what
he
had
felt
at
the
end
or
what
his
mind
had
suffered
if
time
had
been
given
him
to
understand
that
he
was
going
to
die
she
worked
herself
into
agony
lost
at
last
and
wept
with
jane
bond
arms
round
her
and
i
was
so
troubled
because
i
thought
he
had
been
called
back
to
his
ship
she
said
he
called
to
a
better
place
than
a
ship
dear
love
sobbed
jane
after
they
left
her
sir
walter
and
mannering
had
entered
the
grey
room
for
a
moment
and
standing
there
spoke
together
i
have
a
strange
consciousness
that
i
am
living
over
the
past
again
declared
the
physician
things
were
just
so
when
that
poor
woman
nurse
forrester
you
remember
yes
i
felt
the
same
when
caunter
was
breaking
open
the
door
i
faced
the
worst
from
the
beginning
for
the
moment
i
heard
what
he
had
done
i
somehow
knew
that
my
unfortunate
was
dead
i
directly
negatived
his
suggestion
last
night
and
never
dreamed
that
he
would
have
gone
on
with
it
when
he
knew
my
wish
doubtless
he
did
not
realize
how
much
in
earnest
you
were
on
the
subject
this
may
well
prove
as
impossible
to
understand
as
the
death
i
do
not
say
it
will
but
i
suspect
it
will
a
perfectly
healthy
creature
cut
off
in
a
moment
and
nothing
to
show
us
why
absolutely
nothing
a
death
without
a
cause
a
negation
of
science
surely
there
is
a
cause
but
i
do
not
think
this
dreadful
tragedy
will
reveal
it
answered
the
doctor
i
pray
it
may
however
for
all
our
sakes
he
continued
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
deeply
i
feel
this
for
her
but
also
for
you
and
myself
too
he
was
one
of
the
best
a
good
sportsman
and
a
good
man
and
a
great
loss
to
the
service
added
sir
walter
i
have
not
considered
all
this
means
yet
my
thoughts
are
centred
on
mary
you
must
let
me
spare
you
all
i
can
my
friend
there
will
be
an
inquest
of
course
and
an
inquiry
also
a
shall
i
communicate
with
mordred
or
would
you
prefer
that
somebody
else
somebody
else
the
most
famous
man
you
know
from
no
disrespect
to
mordred
or
to
you
mannering
you
understand
that
but
i
should
like
an
independent
examination
by
some
great
authority
some
one
who
knew
nothing
of
the
former
case
this
is
an
appalling
thing
to
happen
i
do
know
where
to
begin
thinking
do
not
put
too
great
a
strain
upon
yourself
leave
it
to
those
who
will
come
to
the
matter
with
all
their
wits
and
without
your
personal
sorrow
an
independent
inquirer
is
certainly
best
one
who
as
you
say
knows
nothing
about
the
former
case
i
do
know
where
to
begin
thinking
repeated
the
other
such
a
thing
upsets
one
preconceived
opinions
i
had
always
regarded
my
aversion
to
this
room
as
a
human
weakness
a
thing
to
be
conquered
look
round
you
would
it
be
possible
to
imagine
an
apartment
with
less
of
evil
suggestion
the
other
made
a
perfunctory
examination
went
into
every
corner
tapped
the
walls
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
the
clean
morning
light
showed
its
intricate
pattern
of
interwoven
circles
converging
from
the
walls
to
the
centre
and
so
creating
a
sense
of
a
lofty
dome
instead
of
a
flat
surface
in
the
centre
was
a
boss
of
a
conventional
lily
flower
opening
its
petals
the
room
should
not
be
touched
till
after
the
inquest
i
think
indeed
if
i
may
advise
you
will
do
well
to
leave
it
just
as
it
is
for
the
police
to
see
they
will
want
to
see
it
i
imagine
unless
you
communicate
direct
with
scotland
yard
ask
for
a
special
inquiry
and
beg
that
the
local
men
are
not
employed
there
is
reason
in
that
for
it
is
quite
certain
that
nobody
here
would
be
of
any
greater
use
to
you
than
they
were
before
act
for
me
then
please
explain
that
money
is
no
object
and
ask
them
to
send
the
most
accomplished
and
experienced
men
in
the
service
but
they
are
only
concerned
with
crime
this
may
be
outside
their
scope
we
can
not
say
as
to
that
we
can
not
even
assert
that
this
is
not
a
crime
we
know
nothing
a
crime
needs
a
criminal
mannering
that
is
so
but
what
would
be
criminal
if
human
agency
were
responsible
for
it
might
nevertheless
be
the
work
of
forces
to
which
the
word
criminal
can
not
be
applied
sir
walter
stared
at
him
is
it
possible
you
suggest
a
supernatural
cause
for
this
the
doctor
shook
his
head
emphatically
not
though
i
am
not
a
materialist
as
you
are
aware
my
generation
of
practitioners
has
little
difficulty
in
reconciling
our
creed
with
our
cult
though
few
of
the
younger
men
are
able
to
do
so
i
admit
but
science
is
science
and
not
for
a
moment
do
i
imagine
anything
supernatural
here
i
think
however
there
are
unconscious
forces
at
work
and
those
responsible
for
setting
those
forces
in
action
would
be
criminals
without
a
doubt
if
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
the
man
who
fires
a
rifle
at
an
animal
if
he
hits
and
kills
it
is
the
destroyer
though
he
may
operate
from
half
a
mile
away
on
the
other
hand
the
agents
may
be
unconscious
of
what
they
are
doing
there
is
no
human
being
in
this
house
for
whom
i
would
not
answer
i
know
it
we
beat
the
wind
it
will
be
time
enough
to
consider
presently
indeed
i
should
rather
that
you
strove
to
relieve
your
mind
of
the
problem
you
have
enough
to
do
without
that
leave
it
to
those
professionally
trained
in
such
mysteries
if
a
man
is
responsible
for
this
atrocious
thing
then
it
should
be
within
the
reach
of
man
wits
to
find
him
we
failed
before
but
this
time
no
casual
examination
of
this
place
or
the
antecedents
of
your
life
will
serve
the
purpose
we
must
go
to
the
bottom
or
rather
skilled
minds
trained
to
do
so
must
go
to
the
bottom
they
will
approach
the
subject
from
a
different
angle
they
will
come
unprejudiced
and
unperturbed
if
there
has
been
foul
play
they
will
find
it
out
in
my
opinion
it
is
incredible
that
they
will
be
baffled
the
best
men
engaged
in
such
work
must
come
to
help
us
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
the
room
is
haunted
and
that
this
is
the
operation
of
an
evil
force
outside
nature
yet
permitted
by
the
creator
to
destroy
human
life
the
idea
is
too
horrible
it
revolts
me
mannering
well
it
may
do
so
banish
any
such
irrational
thought
from
your
mind
it
is
not
worthy
of
you
i
must
go
now
i
will
telegraph
to
london
to
sir
howard
fellowes
also
i
think
to
the
state
authorities
on
forensic
medicine
a
government
analyst
must
do
his
part
shall
i
communicate
with
scotland
yard
leave
that
until
the
evening
you
will
come
again
to
see
mary
please
most
certainly
i
shall
at
three
i
should
have
a
reply
to
my
messages
i
will
go
into
newton
abbot
and
telephone
from
there
i
thank
you
mannering
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
do
more
myself
my
mind
is
cruelly
shaken
this
awful
experience
has
made
an
old
man
of
me
do
say
that
it
is
awful
enough
i
admit
but
life
is
full
of
awful
things
would
that
you
might
have
escaped
them
henry
will
help
you
if
it
is
in
his
power
it
would
be
well
if
we
could
give
him
something
to
do
he
feels
guilty
in
a
way
i
have
little
time
to
observe
other
people
but
he
all
right
he
can
run
into
newton
with
me
now
it
looks
to
me
as
though
his
own
life
had
hung
on
the
pitch
of
a
coin
they
tossed
up
after
that
so
he
tells
me
he
tried
to
dissuade
your
but
failed
lennox
is
rather
cowed
and
dismayed
naturally
the
young
however
survive
mental
and
physical
disasters
and
recover
in
the
most
amazing
manner
their
mental
recuperation
is
on
a
par
with
their
bodily
powers
of
recovery
nature
is
on
their
side
let
me
urge
you
to
go
down
and
take
food
if
you
can
even
lunch
with
your
party
i
should
it
will
distract
your
mind
sir
walter
declared
that
he
had
intended
to
do
so
i
am
an
old
soldier
he
said
it
shall
not
be
thought
i
evade
my
obligations
for
personal
sorrow
as
for
this
room
it
is
accursed
and
i
am
in
a
mind
to
destroy
it
utterly
wait
wait
we
shall
see
what
our
can
find
out
for
us
do
not
think
because
i
am
practical
and
i
am
not
feeling
this
seldom
have
i
had
such
a
shock
in
nearly
forty
years
work
you
know
without
my
telling
you
how
deep
and
heartfelt
is
my
sympathy
i
feel
for
you
both
from
my
soul
i
am
sure
of
that
i
will
try
and
forget
myself
for
the
present
i
must
go
to
my
guests
i
am
very
sorry
for
them
also
it
is
a
fearful
experience
to
crash
upon
their
party
of
pleasure
i
hope
travers
may
stay
he
is
a
comfort
to
you
is
he
not
nobody
can
be
a
comfort
just
now
i
shall
not
ask
him
to
stay
fortunately
henry
is
here
he
will
stop
for
the
present
mary
is
all
that
matters
i
shall
take
her
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
devote
my
every
thought
to
her
i
sure
you
will
it
is
a
sad
duty
but
may
prove
a
very
necessary
one
their
devotion
was
absolute
it
must
go
hard
with
her
when
she
realizes
the
whole
meaning
of
this
he
went
his
way
and
sir
walter
returned
to
his
child
again
with
her
he
visited
the
dead
when
told
that
he
could
do
so
she
was
now
very
she
stopped
a
little
while
only
beside
her
husband
how
beautiful
and
happy
he
looks
she
said
but
what
i
loved
is
gone
and
going
it
has
changed
all
the
rest
this
is
not
tom
only
the
least
part
of
him
her
father
bowed
his
head
i
felt
so
when
your
mother
died
my
dearest
child
then
she
knelt
down
and
put
her
hand
on
the
hand
of
the
dead
man
and
prayed
her
father
knelt
beside
her
and
it
was
he
not
the
young
widow
who
wept
she
rose
presently
i
can
think
of
him
better
away
from
him
now
she
said
i
will
not
see
him
again
they
returned
to
her
old
nursery
and
he
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
face
life
and
take
the
head
of
his
table
at
luncheon
how
brave
of
you
dear
father
she
said
sir
walter
waited
for
the
gong
to
sound
but
it
did
not
and
he
rebuked
himself
for
thinking
that
it
would
sound
masters
had
a
more
correct
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
than
he
he
thought
curiously
upon
this
incident
and
suspected
that
he
must
be
unhinged
a
little
then
he
remembered
a
thing
that
he
had
desired
to
say
to
mary
and
returned
to
her
i
do
not
wish
you
to
sleep
in
this
room
my
darling
he
said
jane
has
begged
me
not
to
i
am
going
to
sleep
with
her
she
answered
chapter
iv
by
the
hand
of
god
sir
walter
always
remembered
that
sunday
luncheon
and
declared
that
it
reminded
him
of
a
very
painful
experience
in
his
early
life
when
shooting
in
south
africa
he
had
once
been
tossed
by
a
wounded
buffalo
bull
by
good
chance
the
creature
threw
him
into
a
gully
some
feet
lower
than
the
surrounding
bush
thus
it
lost
him
and
he
was
safe
from
destruction
there
however
he
remained
with
a
broken
leg
for
some
hours
until
rescued
and
during
that
time
the
mosquitoes
caused
him
unspeakable
torments
the
terrible
disaster
of
the
morning
became
temporarily
overshadowed
by
the
necessity
of
enduring
his
friends
comments
upon
it
the
worst
phase
of
the
ordeal
was
their
pity
sir
walter
had
never
been
pitied
in
his
life
and
detested
the
experience
this
stream
of
sympathy
and
the
chastened
voices
much
oppressed
him
he
was
angry
with
himself
also
for
a
guilty
conviction
that
in
truth
the
interest
of
the
visitors
exceeded
their
grief
he
felt
it
base
to
suspect
them
of
any
such
thing
but
the
buzz
of
their
polite
expressions
combined
with
their
cautious
questions
and
evident
thirst
for
knowledge
caused
him
exquisite
uneasiness
they
all
wanted
to
know
everything
he
could
tell
them
concerning
tom
may
had
he
enemies
was
it
conceivable
that
he
might
have
even
bitter
and
unscrupulous
enemies
dear
mary
is
keeping
up
splendidly
said
travers
she
is
magnificent
thank
heaven
i
have
been
some
little
help
to
her
you
have
nelly
without
a
doubt
do
try
to
eat
more
walter
urged
ernest
travers
much
lies
before
you
indeed
the
worst
has
yet
to
come
you
must
keep
up
for
all
our
sakes
how
thankfully
i
would
share
your
load
if
i
could
i
hope
you
are
going
to
make
this
an
official
matter
sir
walter
and
communicate
with
the
society
for
psychical
research
urged
felix
it
is
just
a
case
for
them
in
fact
when
this
gets
known
widely
as
it
must
of
course
a
great
many
skilled
inquirers
will
wish
to
visit
chadlands
and
spend
a
night
in
the
room
the
police
will
have
to
be
considered
first
declared
colonel
vane
this
is
of
course
a
police
affair
i
should
think
they
will
so
regard
it
there
is
the
service
too
the
admiralty
will
be
sure
to
do
something
is
he
to
be
buried
at
chadlands
i
suppose
so
poor
fellow
murmured
ernest
travers
i
think
your
family
graves
so
distinguished
walter
so
simple
and
fine
and
modest
just
perfectly
kept
grassy
mounds
and
simple
inscriptions
i
was
looking
at
them
after
service
the
vicar
made
a
very
tactful
allusion
to
the
great
grief
that
had
overtaken
the
lord
of
the
manor
at
the
end
of
his
sermon
henry
assisted
his
uncle
to
the
best
of
his
power
it
was
he
who
went
into
the
question
of
the
sunday
service
from
the
neighboring
market
town
and
proved
to
the
relief
of
colonel
vane
and
mr
miles
handford
that
they
might
leave
in
comfort
before
nightfall
and
catch
a
train
to
london
a
car
is
going
in
later
to
meet
poor
tom
father
he
said
and
if
it
any
convenience
it
would
take
you
both
the
pair
thankfully
agreed
then
colonel
vane
interested
sir
walter
in
spite
of
himself
the
latter
had
spoken
of
an
inquiry
and
vane
urged
a
distinguished
name
upon
him
do
get
peter
hardcastle
if
you
can
he
said
he
absolutely
top
hole
at
this
sort
of
thing
at
present
an
amazing
beggar
i
seem
to
have
heard
the
name
who
has
it
was
he
who
got
to
the
bottom
of
that
weird
murder
in
yorkshire
it
was
weird
said
handford
i
knew
intimate
friends
of
the
murdered
man
a
crime
for
which
no
logical
reason
existed
continued
the
colonel
it
puzzled
everybody
till
hardcastle
succeeded
where
his
superior
officers
at
scotland
yard
had
failed
i
believe
he
still
young
but
that
was
less
amazing
than
the
german
spy
you
remember
now
sir
walter
the
spy
had
been
too
clever
for
england
and
france
thanks
to
a
woman
who
helped
him
peter
hardcastle
got
to
know
her
then
he
actually
disguised
himself
as
the
woman
of
course
without
her
knowledge
arrested
her
and
kept
an
appointment
that
she
had
made
with
the
spy
what
was
the
spy
called
i
forget
wundt
said
felix
no
i
do
think
so
hardt
or
hardfelt
or
something
like
that
anyway
a
jolly
wonderful
thing
he
the
first
man
at
this
business
and
i
hope
you
be
able
to
secure
him
if
he
comes
sir
walter
do
let
it
be
known
that
he
is
here
keep
it
a
secret
if
hardcastle
could
come
down
as
your
guest
and
nobody
know
he
was
here
it
might
help
him
to
succeed
and
if
he
fails
then
i
hope
you
invite
the
psychical
research
society
sir
walter
let
the
chatter
flow
past
him
but
he
concentrated
on
the
name
of
peter
hardcastle
he
remembered
the
story
of
the
spy
and
the
sensation
it
had
aroused
millicent
also
remembered
it
hardcastle
declined
to
let
his
photograph
be
published
in
the
halfpenny
papers
i
remember
she
said
that
struck
me
as
so
wonderful
there
was
a
reason
given
that
he
did
not
wish
the
public
to
know
him
by
sight
i
believe
he
is
never
seen
as
himself
and
that
he
makes
up
just
as
easily
to
look
like
a
woman
as
a
man
some
people
believe
he
is
a
woman
no
you
do
say
that
to
have
made
up
as
that
german
friend
and
so
actually
reached
his
presence
nay
secured
him
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
remarkable
pages
in
the
annals
of
crime
said
ernest
travers
is
he
attached
to
scotland
yard
still
or
does
he
work
independently
asked
miles
handford
i
do
know
yet
mannering
has
already
urged
me
to
consult
scotland
yard
at
once
indeed
he
was
going
to
approach
them
hardcastle
shall
certainly
be
invited
to
do
what
he
can
i
shall
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
reach
the
truth
yet
what
even
such
a
man
can
do
is
difficult
to
see
the
walls
of
the
grey
room
are
solid
the
floor
is
of
sound
oak
the
ceiling
is
nine
or
ten
inches
thick
and
supported
by
immense
beams
the
hearth
is
modern
and
the
chimney
not
large
enough
to
admit
a
human
being
this
was
proved
twelve
years
ago
give
him
a
free
hand
all
the
same
with
servants
and
everybody
i
should
ask
him
to
come
as
your
guest
then
nobody
need
know
who
he
is
and
he
can
pursue
his
investigations
the
more
freely
felix
made
this
suggestion
after
luncheon
was
ended
and
masters
and
fred
caunter
had
left
the
room
then
the
conversation
showed
signs
of
drifting
back
to
sentimentality
sir
walter
saw
it
coming
in
their
eyes
and
sought
to
head
them
off
by
inquiring
concerning
their
own
movements
can
i
be
of
any
service
to
simplify
your
plans
i
fear
this
terrible
event
has
put
you
all
to
great
inconvenience
our
inconvenience
is
nothing
beside
your
sorrow
dear
walter
said
nelly
travers
all
declared
that
if
they
could
serve
the
cause
in
any
way
they
would
gladly
stop
at
chadlands
but
since
they
were
powerless
to
assist
they
felt
that
the
sooner
they
departed
the
better
we
go
but
we
leave
our
undying
sympathy
and
commiseration
dear
friend
declared
travers
believe
me
this
has
aged
my
wife
and
myself
probably
it
would
not
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
it
has
aged
us
all
that
he
should
have
come
through
jutland
done
worthy
deeds
won
honorable
mention
and
the
then
to
be
snatched
out
of
life
in
this
incomprehensible
manner
nay
perhaps
even
by
supernatural
means
for
we
can
not
yet
actually
declare
it
is
not
so
all
this
makes
it
impossible
to
say
much
that
can
comfort
you
or
dear
mary
time
must
pass
i
fear
walter
you
must
get
her
away
into
another
environment
thank
heaven
she
has
youth
on
her
side
yes
yes
i
shall
live
for
her
be
sure
of
that
he
left
them
and
presently
spoke
to
his
nephew
alone
in
his
study
do
what
you
can
for
them
handford
and
vane
are
getting
off
this
afternoon
the
rest
early
i
do
think
i
shall
be
able
to
dine
with
them
tom
father
will
be
here
i
fear
he
is
likely
to
be
prostrated
when
he
knows
that
all
is
over
no
he
not
that
kind
of
man
uncle
mary
tells
me
he
will
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
in
his
own
way
he
one
of
the
fighting
sort
but
he
believes
in
a
lot
of
queer
things
i
going
in
to
newton
with
colonel
vane
and
shall
meet
mannering
there
about
about
sir
howard
fellowes
he
come
down
no
doubt
perhaps
mannering
will
know
and
tell
mannering
to
insist
on
a
detective
called
peter
hardcastle
for
the
inquiry
if
he
left
scotland
yard
and
acting
independently
none
the
less
engage
him
i
shall
of
course
thankfully
pay
anything
to
get
this
tragedy
explained
be
sure
they
will
explain
it
if
they
do
not
i
shall
be
tempted
to
leave
altogether
indeed
i
may
do
so
in
any
case
mary
will
never
reconcile
herself
to
live
here
now
do
bother
about
the
future
do
think
about
it
consider
yourself
and
take
a
little
rest
this
afternoon
everybody
is
very
concerned
for
you
they
mean
to
be
awfully
decent
in
their
way
but
i
know
how
they
try
you
they
ca
help
it
such
a
thing
takes
them
out
of
their
daily
round
and
beggars
their
experience
and
makes
them
excited
and
tactless
there
no
precedent
for
them
and
you
know
how
most
people
depend
on
precedent
and
how
they
bowled
over
before
anything
new
i
will
go
to
mary
i
think
has
the
undertaker
been
yes
uncle
i
want
him
to
be
buried
with
us
here
i
should
not
suppose
his
father
will
object
not
likely
mary
would
wish
it
so
it
was
so
typical
of
mary
to
think
of
septimus
may
before
everybody
she
put
her
own
feelings
from
her
that
she
might
soften
the
blow
for
him
she
would
are
you
equal
to
telling
the
clergyman
at
the
station
that
his
son
is
dead
or
ca
you
trust
yourself
to
do
it
i
expect
he
know
it
well
enough
but
i
tell
him
everything
there
is
to
tell
i
remember
long
ago
after
the
wedding
that
he
was
interested
in
haunted
rooms
and
said
he
believed
in
such
things
on
scriptural
grounds
sir
walter
took
pause
at
this
statement
that
is
news
to
me
supposing
he
however
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
with
him
yet
he
will
of
course
be
as
deeply
concerned
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
as
i
am
though
we
must
not
interfere
or
make
the
inquiry
harder
for
hardcastle
than
he
is
bound
to
find
it
certainly
nobody
must
interfere
i
only
hope
we
can
get
peter
hardcastle
tell
them
to
call
me
when
may
arrives
and
not
sooner
i
see
mary
then
lie
down
for
an
hour
or
two
you
feel
all
right
should
you
care
to
see
mannering
i
am
right
enough
say
to
vane
and
miles
handford
for
me
they
may
have
to
return
here
presently
one
ca
tell
who
may
be
wanted
and
who
may
not
be
i
do
know
these
things
are
outside
my
experience
but
they
had
better
both
leave
you
their
directions
i
ask
them
sir
walter
visited
his
daughter
and
changed
his
mind
about
sleeping
she
was
passing
through
an
hour
of
unspeakable
horror
the
dark
temple
of
realization
had
opened
for
her
and
she
was
treading
its
dreary
aisles
henceforth
for
long
days
she
told
herself
for
ever
sorrow
and
sense
of
unutterable
loss
must
be
her
companions
and
share
her
waking
hours
they
stopped
together
alone
till
the
dusk
came
down
and
mannering
returned
he
stayed
but
a
few
minutes
and
presently
they
heard
his
car
start
again
while
that
containing
the
departing
guests
and
henry
lennox
immediately
followed
it
in
due
course
septimus
may
returned
to
chadlands
with
him
the
clergyman
had
heard
of
his
son
end
and
went
immediately
to
see
the
dead
man
there
mary
joined
him
and
witnessed
his
under
very
shattering
grief
he
was
thin
a
grey
man
with
smouldering
eyes
and
an
expression
of
endurance
a
fanatic
in
faith
by
virtue
of
certain
asperities
of
mind
and
a
critical
temperament
he
had
never
made
friends
won
his
parish
into
close
ties
nor
advanced
the
cause
of
his
religion
as
he
had
yearned
to
do
with
the
zeal
of
a
reformer
he
had
entered
the
ministry
in
youth
but
while
commanding
respect
for
his
own
rule
of
conduct
and
the
example
he
set
his
little
flock
their
affection
he
never
won
the
people
feared
him
and
dreaded
his
stern
criticism
once
certain
spirits
smarting
under
pulpit
censure
had
sought
to
be
rid
of
him
but
no
grounds
existed
on
which
they
could
eject
the
reverend
gentleman
or
challenge
his
status
he
remained
therefore
as
many
like
him
remain
embedded
in
his
parish
and
unknown
beyond
it
he
was
a
poor
student
of
human
nature
and
life
had
dimmed
his
old
ambitions
soured
his
hopes
but
it
had
not
clouded
his
faith
with
a
passionate
fervor
he
believed
all
that
he
tried
to
teach
and
held
that
an
almighty
all
loving
and
all
merciful
god
controlled
every
destiny
ordered
existence
for
the
greatest
and
least
and
allowed
nothing
to
happen
upon
earth
that
was
not
the
best
that
could
happen
for
the
immortal
beings
he
had
created
in
his
own
image
upon
this
assurance
fell
the
greatest
almost
the
only
blow
that
life
could
deal
septimus
may
he
was
stricken
suddenly
fearfully
with
his
unutterable
loss
but
his
agony
turned
into
prayer
while
he
knelt
beside
his
son
he
prayed
with
a
fiery
intensity
and
a
resonant
vibration
of
voice
that
scorched
rather
than
comforted
the
woman
who
knelt
beside
him
the
fervor
of
the
man
emotion
and
the
depth
of
his
conviction
running
like
a
torrent
through
the
narrow
channels
of
his
understanding
were
destined
presently
to
complicate
a
situation
sufficiently
painful
without
intervention
for
a
time
swiftly
came
when
septimus
may
forced
his
beliefs
upon
chadlands
and
opposed
them
to
the
opinions
of
other
people
as
deeply
concerned
as
himself
to
explain
the
death
of
his
son
may
learning
that
most
of
the
house
party
could
not
depart
until
the
following
morning
absented
himself
from
dinner
indeed
he
spent
his
time
almost
entirely
with
his
boy
and
when
night
came
kept
vigil
beside
him
something
of
the
strange
possession
of
his
mind
already
appeared
in
curious
hints
that
puzzled
sir
walter
but
it
was
not
until
after
the
examination
and
inquest
that
his
extraordinary
views
were
elaborated
millicent
and
her
uncle
were
the
first
to
depart
on
the
following
day
the
girl
harbored
a
grievance
surely
mary
might
have
seen
me
a
moment
to
say
she
said
it
a
very
dreadful
thing
but
we
been
so
sympathetic
and
understanding
about
it
that
i
think
they
ought
to
feel
rather
grateful
they
might
realize
how
trying
it
is
for
us
too
and
to
let
me
go
without
even
seeing
her
she
saw
travers
over
and
over
again
do
not
mind
grief
makes
people
selfish
declared
felix
probably
we
should
not
have
acted
so
i
think
we
should
have
hidden
our
sufferings
and
faced
our
duty
but
perhaps
we
are
exceptional
i
dare
say
may
will
write
and
express
regret
and
gratitude
later
we
must
allow
for
her
youth
and
sorrow
rather
prided
himself
on
the
charity
of
this
conclusion
when
and
travers
departed
sir
walter
bade
them
farewell
the
lady
wept
and
her
tears
fell
on
his
hand
as
he
held
it
she
was
hysterical
for
heaven
sake
do
let
mary
be
haunted
by
that
dreadful
priest
she
said
there
is
something
terrible
about
him
he
has
no
bowels
of
compassion
i
tried
to
console
him
for
the
loss
of
his
son
and
he
turned
upon
me
as
if
i
were
i
had
to
tell
him
he
was
being
rude
and
forgetting
that
he
spoke
to
a
lady
said
ernest
travers
one
makes
every
allowance
for
a
sufferings
but
they
should
not
take
the
form
of
abrupt
and
harsh
speech
to
a
sympathetic
nay
to
anyone
let
alone
a
woman
his
sacred
calling
ought
to
a
man
profession
can
not
alter
his
manners
my
dear
ernest
they
come
from
defects
of
temperament
no
doubt
may
must
not
be
judged
his
faith
would
move
mountains
so
would
mine
said
ernest
travers
and
so
would
yours
walter
but
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
be
a
christian
and
a
gentleman
to
imply
that
our
faith
was
weak
because
we
expressed
ordinary
human
emotions
and
pitied
him
unfeignedly
for
the
loss
of
his
only
child
my
dear
friends
answered
the
other
i
can
not
say
how
i
esteem
your
kindly
offices
in
this
affliction
may
we
meet
again
presently
god
bless
and
keep
you
both
the
examination
revealed
no
physical
reason
why
thomas
may
should
have
ceased
to
breathe
neither
did
the
subsequent
investigations
of
a
government
analytical
chemist
throw
any
light
upon
the
sudden
death
no
cause
existed
and
therefore
none
could
be
reported
at
the
inquest
held
a
day
later
the
coroner
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
rarely
heard
but
none
dissented
from
it
they
held
that
may
had
received
his
death
by
the
hand
of
god
all
men
receive
death
from
the
hand
of
god
said
septimus
may
when
the
judicial
inquiry
was
ended
they
receive
life
from
the
hand
of
god
also
but
while
bowing
to
that
there
is
a
great
deal
more
we
are
called
to
do
when
god
hand
falls
as
it
has
fallen
upon
my
son
i
shall
pray
beside
his
dust
and
presently
when
he
is
at
peace
i
shall
be
guided
there
is
a
grave
duty
beside
me
sir
walter
and
none
must
come
between
me
and
that
duty
there
is
a
duty
before
all
of
us
and
be
sure
nobody
will
shrink
from
it
i
have
done
what
is
right
so
far
we
have
secured
a
famous
detective
the
most
famous
in
england
they
tell
me
he
is
called
peter
hardcastle
and
he
will
i
hope
be
able
to
arrive
here
immediately
the
clergyman
shook
his
head
i
will
say
nothing
at
present
he
answered
but
believe
me
a
thousand
detectives
can
not
explain
my
son
death
i
shall
return
to
this
subject
after
the
funeral
sir
walter
but
my
conviction
grows
that
the
reason
of
these
things
will
never
be
revealed
to
the
eye
of
science
to
the
eye
of
faith
alone
we
must
trust
the
explanation
of
what
has
happened
there
are
things
concealed
from
the
wise
and
prudent
to
be
revealed
unto
babes
that
night
the
master
of
chadlands
his
nephew
and
the
priest
dined
together
and
henry
lennox
implored
a
privilege
i
feel
i
owe
it
to
poor
tom
in
a
way
he
said
i
beg
that
you
will
let
me
spend
the
night
in
the
grey
room
uncle
walter
i
would
give
my
soul
to
clear
this
but
his
uncle
refused
with
a
curt
shake
of
the
head
and
the
clergyman
uttered
a
reproof
do
not
speak
so
lightly
he
said
you
use
a
common
phrase
and
a
very
objectionable
phrase
young
man
do
you
rate
your
soul
so
low
that
you
would
surrender
it
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
morbid
craving
for
that
is
all
this
amounts
to
not
to
such
an
inquirer
will
my
son
death
reveal
its
secret
i
have
already
received
letters
from
people
offering
and
wishing
to
spend
a
night
in
that
accursed
room
said
sir
walter
do
not
call
it
until
you
know
more
urged
septimus
may
you
have
indeed
charity
answered
the
other
why
withhold
charity
we
must
approach
the
subject
in
the
only
spirit
that
can
disarm
the
danger
these
inquirers
who
seek
to
solve
the
mystery
are
not
concerned
with
my
son
death
only
the
means
that
brought
it
about
not
to
such
as
they
will
any
answer
be
vouchsafed
and
not
to
the
spirit
of
materialistic
inquiry
either
i
speak
what
i
know
and
will
say
more
upon
the
subject
at
another
time
you
can
not
accept
this
awful
thing
without
resentment
or
demur
mr
may
asked
henry
lennox
who
shall
demur
did
not
even
the
unenlightened
men
who
formed
the
coroner
jury
declare
that
tom
passed
into
another
world
by
the
hand
of
god
can
we
question
our
creator
i
too
desire
as
much
as
any
human
being
can
an
explanation
what
is
more
i
am
far
more
confident
of
an
explanation
than
you
or
any
other
man
but
that
is
because
i
already
know
the
only
road
by
which
it
will
please
god
to
send
an
explanation
and
that
is
not
the
road
which
scientists
or
rationalists
are
used
to
travel
it
is
a
road
that
i
must
be
allowed
to
walk
alone
he
left
them
after
dinner
and
returned
to
his
she
had
determined
not
to
attend
the
funeral
but
may
argued
with
her
examined
her
reasons
found
them
in
his
opinion
not
sufficient
and
prevailed
with
her
to
change
her
mind
drink
the
cup
to
the
dregs
he
said
this
is
our
grief
our
trial
none
feel
and
know
what
we
feel
and
know
and
your
youth
is
called
to
bear
a
burden
heavy
to
be
borne
you
must
stand
beside
his
grave
as
surely
as
i
must
commit
him
to
it
men
will
go
far
to
look
upon
the
coffin
of
one
whose
end
happens
to
be
mysterious
or
terrible
the
death
of
sir
walter
had
made
much
matter
for
the
newspapers
and
not
only
chadlands
but
the
countryside
converged
upon
the
naval
funeral
lined
the
route
to
the
grave
and
crowded
the
little
burying
ground
where
the
dead
man
would
lie
cameras
pointed
their
eyes
at
the
and
the
mourners
behind
it
the
photographers
worked
for
a
sort
of
illustrated
paper
that
tramples
with
a
swine
hoofs
and
routs
up
with
a
swine
nose
the
matter
its
clients

love
to
purchase
mary
supported
by
her
father
and
her
cousin
preserved
a
brave
composure
indeed
she
was
less
visibly
moved
than
they
it
seemed
that
the
ascetic
parent
of
the
dead
had
power
to
lift
the
widow
to
his
own
stern
the
chaplain
of
tom

at
the
service
but
septimus
may
conducted
it
not
a
few
old
messmates
attended
for
the
sailor
had
been
popular
and
his
unexpected
death
brought
genuine
grief
to
many
men
under
a
pile
of
flowers
the
coffin
was
carried
to
the
grave
rare
and
precious
blossoms
came
from
sir
walter
friends
and
indomitable
sent
a
mighty
anchor
of
purple
violets
may
read
the
service
without
a
tremor
but
his
eyes
blazed
out
of
his
lean
head
and
there
lacked
not
other
signs
to
indicate
the
depth
of
emotion
he
concealed
then
the
bluejackets
who
had
drawn
the
fired
a
volley
and
the
rattle
of
their
musketry
echoed
sharply
from
the
church
tower
upon
the
evening
of
the
day
that
followed
septimus
may
resumed
the
subject
concerning
which
he
had
already
fitfully
spoken
his
ideas
were
now
in
order
and
he
brought
a
formidable
argument
to
support
a
strange
request
indeed
it
amounted
to
a
demand
and
for
a
time
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
sir
walter
would
deny
him
the
priest
indeed
declared
that
he
could
take
no
denial
and
his
host
was
thankful
that
other
and
stronger
arguments
than
his
own
were
at
hand
to
argue
the
other
side
for
mannering
stayed
at
the
manor
house
after
the
funeral
and
the
rev
noel
prodgers
the
vicar
of
chadlands
a
distant
connection
of
the
lennoxes
was
also
dining
there
until
now
mannering
could
not
well
speak
but
he
invited
himself
to
dinner
on
the
day
after
the
funeral
that
he
might
press
a
course
of
action
upon
those
who
had
suffered
so
severely
he
wished
sir
walter
to
take
his
daughter
away
at
once
for
her
health
sake
and
while
advancing
this
advice
considered
the
elder
also
for
these
things
had
upset
the
master
of
chadlands
in
mind
and
body
and
mannering
was
aware
of
it
on
the
morrow
peter
hardcastle
would
arrive
and
he
had
urgently
directed
that
his
coming
should
be
in
a
private
capacity
unknown
to
the
local
police
or
neighborhood
neither
did
he
wish
the
staff
of
chadlands
to
associate
him
with
the
tragedy
an
official
examination
of
the
room
had
been
made
by
the
local
constabulary
as
upon
the
occasion
of
nurse
forrester
death
but
it
was
a
perfunctory
matter
and
those
responsible
for
it
understood
that
special
attention
would
presently
be
paid
to
the
problem
by
the
supreme
authority
after
this
man
has
been
and
gone
i
do
earnestly
beg
you
to
leave
england
and
get
abroad
sir
walter
said
mannering
i
think
it
your
duty
not
only
for
your
girl
sake
but
your
own
do
not
even
wait
for
the
report
there
is
nothing
to
keep
you
and
i
shall
personally
be
very
thankful
and
relieved
if
you
will
manage
this
and
take
mary
to
some
fresh
scenes
a
place
or
country
that
she
has
not
visited
before
there
is
nothing
like
an
entirely
novel
environment
for
distracting
the
mind
bracing
the
nerves
and
restoring
tone
i
must
do
my
duty
answered
the
other
and
that
remains
to
be
seen
if
hardcastle
should
find
out
anything
there
may
be
a
call
upon
me
at
least
i
can
not
turn
my
back
upon
chadlands
till
the
mystery
is
threshed
out
to
the
bottom
as
far
as
man
can
do
it
it
was
then
that
septimus
may
spoke
and
astounded
his
hearers
you
give
me
the
opportunity
to
introduce
my
subject
he
said
for
it
bears
directly
on
sir
walter
intentions
and
it
is
in
my
power
as
i
devoutly
believe
to
free
him
swiftly
of
any
further
need
to
remain
here
i
am
of
course
prepared
to
argue
for
my
purpose
but
would
rather
not
do
so
briefly
i
hold
it
a
vital
obligation
to
spend
this
night
in
the
grey
room
and
i
ask
that
no
obstacle
of
any
kind
be
raised
to
prevent
my
doing
so
the
wisdom
of
man
is
foolishness
before
the
wit
of
god
and
what
i
desire
to
do
is
god
will
and
wish
impressed
upon
me
while
i
knelt
for
long
hours
and
prayed
to
know
it
i
am
convinced
and
that
should
be
enough
in
this
matter
i
am
far
from
satisfied
that
all
has
yet
been
done
within
the
almighty
purpose
and
direction
to
discover
the
mystery
of
our
terrible
loss
but
he
helps
those
who
help
themselves
remember
and
i
owe
it
to
my
son
sir
walter
and
you
owe
it
to
your
daughter
mary
first
and
the
community
also
to
take
such
steps
as
heaven
through
me
has
now
directed
they
were
for
a
moment
struck
dumb
by
this
extraordinary
assertion
and
demand
a
thousand
objections
leaped
to
the
lips
of
the
elder
men
and
prodgers
a
devout
young
christian
of
poor
physique
but
great
spiritual
courage
found
himself
as
interested
by
this
fearless
demand
of
faith
as
the
others
were
alarmed
by
it
sir
walter
spoke
we
know
it
is
so
may
none
recognizes
our
obligations
both
to
the
living
and
the
dead
more
acutely
than
i
do
a
very
famous
man
of
european
reputation
will
be
here
and
if
you
too
desire
a
representative
you
have
only
got
to
say
so
i
desire
no
representative
armed
with
material
craft
or
knowledge
of
criminal
procedure
i
am
my
own
representative
and
i
come
armed
with
greater
power
than
any
you
can
command
on
earth
sir
walter
i
mean
my
maker
response
to
my
prayer
i
must
spend
the
night
in
that
room
and
can
not
leave
chadlands
until
i
have
done
so
i
trust
to
no
human
expedient
or
precaution
for
such
things
would
actually
disarm
me
but
my
faith
is
in
the
god
i
have
served
to
the
best
of
my
power
from
my
youth
up
i
entertain
not
the
least
shadow
of
fear
or
doubt
to
fear
or
doubt
would
be
to
fail
i
rely
absolutely
on
the
supreme
being
who
has
permitted
this
unspeakable
sorrow
to
fall
upon
us
and
there
is
no
living
man
less
likely
than
myself
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
unknown
spirit
hidden
here
and
permitted
to
exercise
such
awful
control
over
us
the
time
has
come
to
challenge
that
spirit
in
the
name
of
its
maker
and
to
cleanse
your
house
once
and
for
all
of
something
which
potent
for
evil
though
it
is
allowed
to
be
must
yield
to
the
forces
of
the
most
high
even
in
the
feeble
hand
of
his
minister
the
doctor
spoke
is
it
possible
sir
that
you
attribute
your
son
death
to
anything
but
natural
physical
forces
he
asked
is
it
possible
to
do
otherwise
how
can
you
of
all
men
ask
science
has
spoken
or
rather
science
has
been
struck
dumb
no
natural
physical
force
is
responsible
for
his
end
he
died
without
any
cause
that
you
could
discover
this
is
no
new
thing
however
history
records
that
men
have
passed
similarly
under
visitations
beyond
human
power
to
explain
if
the
lord
could
slay
multitudes
in
a
night
at
a
breath
as
we
know
from
the
pages
of
the
old
testament
then
it
is
certain
he
can
still
end
the
life
of
any
man
at
any
moment
and
send
his
messengers
to
do
so
i
believe
in
good
and
evil
spirits
as
i
believe
in
my
bible
and
i
know
that
strong
and
terrible
though
they
may
be
and
gifted
with
capital
powers
against
our
flesh
yet
the
will
of
god
is
stronger
than
the
strongest
of
them
these
things
i
say
have
happened
before
they
are
sent
to
try
our
faith
i
do
not
mourn
my
son
save
with
the
blind
natural
pang
of
paternity
because
i
know
that
he
has
been
withdrawn
from
this
world
for
higher
purposes
in
another
but
the
means
of
his
going
i
demand
to
investigate
because
they
may
signify
much
more
than
his
death
itself
one
reason
for
his
death
may
be
this
that
we
are
now
called
to
understand
what
is
hidden
in
the
grey
room
my
son
death
may
have
been
necessary
to
that
explanation
human
intervention
may
be
demanded
there
one
of
god
immortal
souls
for
reasons
we
can
not
tell
may
be
chained
in
that
room
waiting
its
liberation
at
human
hands
we
are
challenged
and
i
accept
the
challenge
being
impelled
thereto
by
the
sacred
message
that
has
been
put
into
my
heart
even
his
stared
in
bewilderment
at
septimus
extraordinary
opinions
while
to
the
physician
this
was
the
chatter
of
a
lunatic
i
will
take
my
bible
into
that
haunted
room
concluded
the
clergyman
and
i
will
pray
to
god
who
sits
above
both
quick
and
dead
to
protect
me
guide
me
and
lead
me
to
my
duty
sir
walter
spoke
you
flout
reason
when
you
say
these
things
my
dear
may
and
why
should
i
not
flout
reason
what
christian
but
knows
well
enough
that
reason
is
the
staff
that
breaks
in
our
hands
and
wounds
us
much
of
our
most
vital
experience
has
no
part
nor
lot
with
reason
a
thousand
things
happen
in
the
soul
history
which
reason
can
not
account
for
a
thousand
moods
temptations
incitements
prompt
us
to
action
or
deter
us
from
it
urge
us
to
do
or
avoid
for
which
reason
is
not
responsible
reason
if
we
bring
these
emotions
to
it
can
not
even
pronounce
upon
them
yet
in
them
and
from
them
springs
the
life
of
the
soul
and
the
conviction
of
immortality
act
on
impulse
who
but
daily
realizes
that
commonplace
in
his
own
experience
the
mind
does
not
only
play
tricks
and
laugh
at
reason
in
dreams
while
we
sleep
it
laughs
at
reason
while
we
wake
and
the
sanest
spirit
experiences
inspired
moments
mad
moments
unaccountable
impulses
the
reason
for
which
he
knows
not
the
ancients
explained
these
as
temptations
of
malicious
and
malignant
spirits
or
promptings
from
unseen
beings
who
wish
man
well
and
where
the
urge
is
to
evil
that
may
well
be
the
truth
and
where
it
is
to
good
who
can
doubt
whence
the
inspiration
comes
and
shall
not
my
inspiration
to
employ
the
cleverest
detective
in
england
be
also
of
good
asked
sir
walter
emphatically
not
because
this
thing
is
in
another
category
than
that
of
human
crime
it
is
lifted
upon
a
plane
where
the
knowledge
of
man
avails
nothing
you
are
a
christian
and
you
should
understand
this
as
well
as
i
do
if
there
is
danger
then
i
am
secure
because
i
have
the
only
arms
that
can
avail
in
a
battle
of
the
spirit
my
trust
is
shield
enough
against
any
evil
being
that
may
roam
this
earth
or
be
held
by
invisible
bonds
within
the
walls
of
the
grey
room
i
will
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
man
and
through
the
channel
of
potent
prayer
exorcise
this
presence
and
bring
peace
to
your
afflicted
house
for
any
living
would
i
gladly
pit
my
faith
against
evil
how
much
more
then
in
a
matter
where
my
very
own
life
blood
has
been
shed
you
can
not
deny
me
this
it
is
my
right
i
will
ask
you
to
listen
to
the
arguments
against
you
nevertheless
replied
mannering
you
have
propounded
an
extraordinary
theory
and
must
not
mind
if
we
disagree
with
you
speak
for
yourself
alone
then
answered
may
i
do
not
ask
or
expect
a
man
of
your
profession
to
agree
with
me
but
the
question
ceases
to
be
your
province
do
not
say
that
sir
urged
henry
lennox
i
do
think
my
uncle
agrees
with
you
either
you
are
assuming
too
much
honestly
i
ca
quite
admit
your
assumption
my
dear
may
declared
sir
walter
you
go
too
far
farther
than
is
justified
at
this
stage
of
events
at
any
rate
were
we
in
no
doubt
that
a
spirit
is
granted
power
within
my
house
to
destroy
human
life
then
i
confess
with
due
precautions
i
could
not
deny
you
access
to
it
in
the
omnipotent
name
you
invoke
i
am
a
christian
and
believe
my
bible
as
soundly
as
you
do
but
why
assume
such
an
extraordinary
situation
why
seek
a
supernatural
cause
for
dear
tom
death
before
we
are
satisfied
that
no
other
exists
are
you
not
satisfied
what
mortal
man
can
explain
the
facts
on
any
foundation
of
human
knowledge
consider
how
limited
human
knowledge
is
said
mannering
and
grant
that
we
have
not
exhausted
its
possibilities
yet
there
may
be
some
physical
peculiarity
about
the
room
some
deadly
but
perfectly
natural
chemical
accident
some
volatile
stuff
in
roof
or
walls
that
reacts
to
the
lowered
temperatures
of
night
a
thousand
rare
chance
combinations
of
matter
may
occur
which
are
capable
of
examination
and
which
under
skilled
experiment
will
resolve
their
secret
nothing
it
more
bewildering
than
a
good
conjuring
trick
till
we
know
how
it
is
done
and
nature
is
the
supreme
conjurer
we
have
not
found
out
all
her
tricks
and
never
shall
do
so
but
we
very
well
know
that
a
solution
to
all
of
them
exists
a
material
outlook
and
arrogant
said
the
priest
whereupon
mannering
grew
a
little
warm
it
is
neither
material
nor
arrogant
i
am
humbler
than
you
and
your
positive
assertion
seems
much
the
more
arrogant
this
is
the
twentieth
century
and
your
mediaeval
attitude
would
win
no
possible
sympathy
or
support
from
any
educated
man
truth
can
afford
to
be
patient
answered
may
but
i
too
am
quite
sane
though
your
face
doubts
it
i
do
not
claim
that
human
prayer
can
alter
physical
laws
and
i
do
not
ask
my
maker
to
work
a
miracle
on
my
behalf
or
suspend
the
operations
of
cause
and
effect
but
i
am
satisfied
that
we
are
in
a
region
outside
our
experience
and
on
another
plane
and
dimension
than
those
controlled
by
natural
law
god
has
permitted
us
to
enter
such
a
region
he
has
opened
the
door
into
this
mystery
he
has
spoken
to
my
soul
and
so
directed
me
that
i
can
not
sit
with
folded
hands
this
is
i
repeat
a
challenge
to
me
personally
there
is
as
i
potently
believe
a
being
in
bondage
here
which
only
the
voice
of
god
speaking
through
one
of
his
creatures
can
liberate
if
i
am
wrong
then
i
shall
pray
in
vain
if
right
as
i
know
by
deepest
conviction
and
intuition
then
my
prayer
must
avail
in
any
case
i
do
my
duty
and
if
i
myself
was
called
to
die
while
so
doing
what
nobler
death
can
i
desire
mannering
regarded
the
speaker
with
growing
concern
but
he
still
assumed
sanity
on
the
part
of
the
reverend
gentleman
and
still
felt
considerable
irritation
mix
with
his
solicitude
you
must
consider
others
a
little
he
said
no
mannering
they
must
consider
me
providence
sends
me
a
message
denied
to
the
rest
of
you
because
i
am
a
fit
recipient
you
are
not
it
is
newman
sense
a
conviction
arising
from
far
deeper
and
purer
than
those
that
account
for
human
reason
i
know
because
i
know
reasoning
at
best
is
mere
inference
deduced
from
observation
but
i
am
concerned
with
an
inspiration
a
something
akin
to
the
gift
of
prophecy
then
i
can
only
hope
that
sir
walter
will
exercise
his
rights
and
responsibilities
and
deny
you
what
you
wish
he
has
faith
and
i
am
sorry
that
you
lack
it
no
may
you
must
not
say
that
it
is
entirely
reasonable
that
mannering
should
ask
you
to
consider
others
said
sir
walter
to
you
a
sudden
and
peaceful
death
might
be
no
ill
but
it
would
be
a
very
serious
ill
to
the
living
a
loss
to
your
work
on
earth
which
is
not
done
a
shock
and
grief
to
those
who
respect
you
and
a
reflection
on
all
here
let
the
living
minister
to
the
living
and
put
their
trust
in
god
mannering
spoke
to
the
vicar
of
chadlands
what
do
you
think
prodgers
you
are
a
parson
too
yet
may
be
able
to
see
with
our
eyes
surely
common
sense
should
be
left
out
of
our
calculations
even
if
they
concern
the
next
world
i
respect
may
faith
answered
the
younger
priest
and
assuredly
i
believe
that
if
we
eliminate
all
physical
and
natural
causes
from
poor
captain
may
death
then
no
member
of
our
sacred
calling
should
fear
to
spend
the
night
alone
in
that
room
jacob
wrestled
with
the
angel
of
light
shall
the
servants
of
god
fear
to
oppose
a
dark
angel
well
spoken
said
may
but
that
is
not
all
sir
continued
noel
prodgers
it
is
impossible
that
we
can
share
such
certainty
as
you
claim
probability
lies
entirely
against
it
this
has
happened
twice
remember
and
each
time
a
valuable
and
precious
life
disappears
for
causes
beyond
our
knowledge
that
however
is
no
reason
for
assuming
the
causes
are
beyond
all
human
knowledge
we
do
not
all
possess
learning
in
physics
i
would
venture
most
earnestly
to
beg
you
to
desist
at
least
until
much
more
has
been
done
and
this
famous
professional
man
has
made
such
researches
as
his
genius
suggests
that
is
only
reasonable
and
reason
after
all
is
a
mighty
gift
of
god
a
gift
no
doubt
often
abused
by
finite
beings
who
actually
use
it
to
defy
the
giver
yet
none
the
less
in
its
proper
place
the
handmaid
of
faith
and
the
light
of
true
progress
but
septimus
may
argued
against
him
to
shelter
behind
reason
at
such
a
moment
is
to
blunt
the
sword
of
the
spirit
he
replied
and
human
reason
is
never
the
handmaid
of
faith
as
you
wrongly
suggest
but
her
obdurate
unsleeping
foe
that
which
metaphysicians
call
intuition
and
which
i
call
the
voice
of
god
tells
me
in
clear
tones
that
my
boy
died
by
no
human
agency
whatever
and
by
no
natural
accident
he
was
wrapt
from
this
life
to
the
next
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
by
forces
or
a
force
concerning
which
we
know
nothing
save
through
the
word
of
god
i
will
go
farther
i
will
venture
to
declare
that
this
ghost
or
discarnate
but
conscious
being
may
not
be
as
you
say
a
dark
angel
perhaps
not
wholly
evil
perhaps
not
evil
at
all
one
thing
none
can
question
it
did
the
will
of
its
creator
as
we
all
must
and
we
are
not
therefore
justified
in
asserting
that
a
malignant
force
was
exerted
to
say
so
is
to
speak
in
terms
of
our
own
bitter
loss
and
our
own
aching
hearts
but
we
are
justified
in
believing
that
a
fearful
unknown
power
was
liberated
during
the
night
that
tom
died
and
i
desire
to
approach
that
power
upon
my
knees
and
with
my
life
in
my
hands
the
conviction
of
this
righteous
but
superstitious
soul
was
uttered
with
passionate
zeal
he
puzzled
to
understand
how
fellow
christians
could
argue
against
him
and
much
resented
the
fact
that
sir
walter
withstood
his
claim
and
declined
to
permit
the
experiment
he
desired
to
make
a
formalist
and
precisian
he
held
any
sort
of
doubt
to
be
backsliding
before
the
message
in
his
own
heart
they
argued
unavailingly
with
him
and
henry
lennox
suggested
a
compromise
why
is
it
vital
after
all
that
only
one
should
undertake
this
ordeal
he
asked
i
begged
you
to
let
me
try
for
revenge
do
not
use
that
word
said
prodgers
well
at
any
rate
i
feel
just
as
great
a
call
to
be
there
as
father
can
feel
just
as
pressing
a
demand
and
desire
there
may
have
been
foul
play
at
any
rate
the
thing
was
done
by
an
active
agency
and
tom
was
taken
in
some
way
at
a
disadvantage
there
was
no
fair
fight
i
swear
he
was
evidently
kneeling
calmly
enough
looking
out
of
the
window
when
he
died
and
the
blow
must
have
been
a
coward
blow
struck
from
behind
whoever
struck
it
there
was
no
blow
henry
said
sir
walter
death
is
a
blow
uncle
the
most
awful
blow
a
strong
man
can
be
called
to
suffer
surely
and
i
beg
this
that
if
you
wo
let
me
face
the
infernal
thing
alone
you
let
me
share
this
business
with
may
he
can
pray
and
i
can
watch
but
the
dead
man
father
made
short
work
of
henry
proposition
you
are
introducing
that
very
element
of
rationalism
to
be
before
all
things
distrusted
here
the
mere
introduction
of
human
precaution
and
human
weapons
would
sully
faith
and
make
of
no
avail
the
only
sure
means
of
winning
light
on
this
solemn
problem
reason
so
employed
would
be
a
hindrance
an
actual
danger
only
absolute
faith
can
unravel
the
mystery
before
us
then
frankly
i
tell
you
that
i
lack
any
such
absolute
faith
declared
sir
walter
do
not
say
that
you
libel
yourself
and
are
letting
a
base
and
material
fear
cloud
your
own
trust
answered
may
as
there
is
no
human
reason
for
what
has
happened
so
no
human
reason
will
be
found
to
explain
it
by
denying
me
you
are
denying
the
sole
means
by
which
this
dark
terror
can
be
banished
you
are
denying
god
offer
of
peace
we
must
not
only
seek
peace
but
ensure
it
that
means
that
we
are
now
called
to
take
such
steps
as
the
almighty
puts
at
our
service
by
the
road
of
conscience
and
faith
i
have
a
right
to
this
revelation
as
my
boy
father
the
cup
is
mine
and
you
will
do
very
wrongly
if
you
deny
me
the
right
to
drink
it
i
desire
to
say
be
to
this
house
before
i
leave
it
and
christian
to
christian
you
can
not
deny
me
or
hesitate
as
to
your
answer
no
argument
would
bend
his
obstinate
conviction
and
he
debated
with
great
force
from
his
own
standpoint
he
presented
a
man
overmastered
and
mentally
incapable
of
appreciating
any
argument
against
his
possession
but
sir
walter
now
determined
was
as
obstinate
as
the
clergyman
mannering
bluntly
declared
that
it
would
be
suicide
on
may
part
and
a
conniving
at
the
same
by
any
who
permitted
him
to
attempt
his
vigil
i
too
must
do
my
duty
as
i
see
it
summed
up
the
master
of
chadlands
and
after
i
have
done
so
then
we
may
be
in
a
position
to
admit
the
case
is
altered
the
other
suddenly
rose
and
lifted
his
hands
he
was
trembling
with
emotion
may
my
god
give
a
sign
then
he
cried
they
were
silent
a
moment
for
courtesy
or
astonishment
nothing
happened
and
presently
sir
walter
spoke
you
must
bear
with
me
you
are
upset
and
scarcely
know
the
gravity
of
the
things
you
say
the
physical
and
material
investigation
that
i
consider
proper
and
the
world
has
a
right
to
demand
will
be
made
in
a
spirit
i
hope
as
earnest
and
devout
as
your
own
and
if
after
that
no
shadow
of
explanation
is
forthcoming
and
no
peril
to
life
can
be
discovered
then
i
should
feel
disposed
to
consider
your
views
more
seriously
with
many
reserves
however
at
any
rate
it
will
be
your
turn
then
if
you
still
adhere
to
your
opinions
and
i
am
sure
all
just
persons
who
hear
of
your
purpose
would
join
their
prayers
with
you
your
faith
is
weak
though
you
believe
it
strong
answered
the
other
and
he
was
equally
curt
when
the
physician
advised
him
to
take
a
before
retiring
he
bade
them
without
more
words
and
went
to
his
room
while
after
further
conversation
mannering
and
prodgers
took
their
leave
the
former
strongly
urged
sir
walter
to
set
some
sort
of
guard
outside
the
door
of
the
grey
room
that
man
not
wholly
sane
he
declared
and
he
appears
to
glory
in
the
fact
that
he
is
he
must
surely
be
aware
that
much
he
said
was
superstitious
bosh
look
after
him
guard
his
own
apartment
that
will
be
the
simplest
plan
when
they
had
gone
sir
walter
addressed
his
nephew
they
went
upstairs
together
and
stood
for
a
moment
outside
the
grey
room
the
door
was
wide
open
and
the
place
brilliantly
lighted
by
a
bulb
so
had
it
been
by
night
ever
since
the
disaster
none
of
the
household
entered
it
and
none
save
sir
walter
or
henry
was
willing
to
do
so
until
more
should
be
known
i
have
your
word
of
honor
you
will
not
go
into
that
room
said
his
uncle
but
such
is
the
mental
condition
of
this
poor
clergyman
that
i
can
but
feel
mannering
is
right
may
might
from
some
fancied
call
of
the
spirit
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
and
do
what
he
wishes
to
do
this
must
be
prevented
at
any
cost
i
will
ask
you
henry
to
follow
the
doctor
suggestion
on
my
behalf
and
keep
guard
over
him
oppose
him
actively
if
he
should
appear
and
call
me
i
would
suggest
that
caunter
or
masters
accompanied
you
but
that
is
only
to
make
gossip
and
mystery
on
no
account
i
look
after
him
you
can
trust
me
i
expect
pretty
worn
out
after
such
a
harrowing
day
poor
old
beggar
probably
sleep
soundly
enough
when
he
gets
to
bed
i
trust
so
i
can
not
offer
to
aid
you
myself
for
i
am
dead
beat
said
the
other
then
they
parted
and
the
younger
presently
took
up
a
position
in
the
west
wing
of
the
house
where
septimus
may
had
his
bedroom
not
until
sunrise
did
henry
lennox
go
to
his
own
chamber
but
his
sleepless
night
proved
a
needless
precaution
for
septimus
may
gave
no
sign
chapter
the
unseen
moves
before
ten
on
the
following
morning
peter
hardcastle
who
had
travelled
by
the
night
train
from
paddington
was
at
chadlands
a
car
had
gone
into
newton
abbot
to
meet
him
as
no
train
ran
on
the
branch
line
until
a
later
hour
the
history
of
the
detective
was
one
of
hard
work
crowned
at
last
by
a
very
remarkable
success
his
opportunity
had
come
and
he
had
grasped
it
the
accident
of
the
war
and
the
immense
publicity
given
to
his
capture
of
a
german
secret
agent
had
brought
him
into
fame
and
raised
him
to
the
heights
of
his
profession
moreover
the
extraordinary
histrionic
means
taken
to
achieve
his
purpose
and
the
picturesqueness
of
the
details
captured
that
latent
love
of
romance
common
to
all
minds
hardcastle
had
become
a
lion
women
were
foolish
about
him
he
might
have
made
a
great
match
and
retired
into
private
life
had
he
desired
to
do
so
at
the
present
time
an
american
heiress
ardently
wished
to
wed
the
man
but
he
was
not
fond
of
women
and
only
in
love
with
his
business
a
hard
life
in
the
seamy
places
of
the
world
had
made
him
something
of
a
cynic
he
had
always
appreciated
his
own
singular
powers
and
consciousness
of
ability
combined
with
a
steadfast
patience
and
unconquerable
devotion
to
his
art
as
he
called
it
had
brought
him
through
twenty
years
in
the
police
force
he
began
at
the
bottom
and
reached
the
top
he
was
the
son
of
a
small
shopkeeper
and
now
that
his
father
was
dead
his
mother
still
ran
a
little
for
her
own
satisfaction
and
occupation
peter
hardcastle
was
forty
he
had
already
made
arrangements
to
leave
scotland
yard
and
set
up
as
a
private
inquiry
agent
the
mystery
of
chadlands
would
be
the
last
case
to
occupy
him
as
a
government
servant
in
a
measure
he
regretted
the
fact
for
the
death
of
captain
thomas
may
concerning
which
every
known
particular
was
now
in
his
possession
attracted
him
and
he
knew
the
incident
had
been
widely
published
it
was
a
popular
mystery
and
as
a
man
of
business
he
well
understood
the
professional
value
of
such
sensations
to
the
man
who
resolves
the
puzzle
his
attitude
toward
the
case
appeared
at
the
outset
and
sir
walter
who
had
been
deeply
impressed
by
the
opinions
of
the
dead
man
father
and
even
unconsciously
influenced
by
them
now
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
very
different
intellect
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
superstitious
about
peter
hardcastle
he
uttered
the
views
of
a
remorseless
realist
and
at
the
outset
committed
himself
to
certain
definite
assumptions
the
inhabitants
of
the
manor
house
were
informed
that
a
friend
of
sir
walter
had
come
to
visit
chadlands
and
they
saw
nothing
to
make
them
doubt
it
for
peter
was
a
great
actor
he
had
mixed
with
all
classes
and
the
detective
had
the
imitative
cleverness
to
adapt
himself
in
speech
and
attire
to
every
society
he
even
claimed
that
he
could
think
with
the
brains
of
anybody
and
adapt
his
inner
mind
as
well
as
his
outer
shape
to
the
changing
environment
of
his
activities
he
appreciated
the
histrionics
that
operate
out
of
sight
and
would
adopt
the
blank
purview
of
the
ignorant
the
deeper
attitude
of
the
cultured
or
the
solid
posture
of
that
class
whose
education
and
inherent
opinions
is
based
upon
tradition
he
had
made
a
study
of
the
superficial
etiquette
and
manners
and
customs
of
what
is
called
the
best
society
and
knew
its
ways
as
a
naturalist
patiently
masters
the
habits
of
a
species
chadlands
saw
a
small
fair
man
with
scanty
hair
a
face
a
rather
feminine
cast
of
features
a
broad
forehead
eyes
and
a
narrow
lipless
mouth
which
revealed
very
fine
white
teeth
when
he
spoke
it
was
a
colorless
face
and
challenged
no
attention
but
it
was
a
face
that
served
as
an
excellent
canvas
and
few
professional
actors
had
ever
surpassed
peter
in
the
art
of
making
up
their
features
similarly
he
could
disguise
his
voice
the
natural
tones
of
which
were
low
monotonous
and
of
no
arrestive
quality
hardcastle
surprised
sir
walter
by
his
commonplace
appearance
and
seeming
youth
for
he
looked
ten
years
younger
than
the
forty
he
had
lived
a
being
so
undistinguished
rather
disappointed
his
elder
for
the
master
of
chadlands
had
imagined
that
any
man
of
such
wide
celebrity
must
offer
superficial
marks
of
greatness
but
here
was
one
so
insignificant
and
so
undersized
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
imagine
him
a
famous
englishman
his
very
voice
in
its
level
tones
added
to
the
suggestion
of
mediocrity
sir
walter
found
however
that
the
detective
did
not
undervalue
himself
he
was
not
arrogant
but
revealed
decision
and
immense
will
power
from
the
first
he
imposed
his
personality
and
made
people
forget
the
accidents
of
his
physical
constitution
he
said
very
little
during
breakfast
but
listened
with
attention
to
the
conversation
he
observed
that
henry
lennox
spoke
seldom
but
studied
him
unobtrusively
as
a
man
concerning
whom
he
specially
desired
to
know
more
hardcastle
proved
himself
well
educated
indeed
his
reading
studiously
pursued
and
his
intellectual
attainments
developed
by
hard
work
and
ambition
far
exceeded
those
of
any
present
the
clergyman
returned
to
his
own
ground
and
expressed
his
former
opinions
to
which
hardcastle
listened
without
a
shadow
of
the
secret
surprise
they
awoke
in
him
the
witchcraft
act
assumes
that
there
can
be
no
possible
communication
between
living
men
and
spirits
he
said
in
answer
to
an
assertion
whereon
septimus
may
instantly
took
up
the
challenge
a
fatuous
archaic
assumption
and
long
since
destroyed
by
actual
human
experience
he
replied
it
is
time
such
blasphemous
folly
should
be
banished
from
the
statute
book
i
say
because
such
an
act
takes
no
cognizance
of
the
word
of
god
outworn
acts
of
parliament
are
responsible
for
a
great
deal
of
needless
misery
in
this
world
and
it
is
high
time
these
ordinances
of
another
generation
were
sent
to
the
dust
heap
in
that
last
opinion
i
heartily
agree
with
you
declared
the
detective
henry
ventured
a
quotation
he
was
much
interested
to
learn
whether
hardcastle
had
any
views
on
the
ghost
theory
goethe
says
that
matter
can
not
exist
without
spirit
or
spirit
without
matter
would
you
to
that
mr
hardcastle
partially
matter
can
exist
without
spirit
which
you
may
prove
by
getting
under
an
avalanche
but
i
do
most
emphatically
agree
that
spirit
can
not
exist
without
matter
from
matter
where
is
life
asks
tyndall
and
nobody
can
answer
him
you
misunderstand
goethe
declared
may
in
metaphysics
i
have
no
use
for
metaphysics
believe
me
the
solemn
humbug
of
metaphysics
does
take
in
a
policeman
for
a
moment
juggling
with
words
never
advanced
the
world
welfare
or
helped
the
cause
of
truth
what
for
any
practical
purpose
does
it
matter
how
subjectively
true
a
statement
may
be
if
it
is
objectively
false
life
is
just
as
real
as
i
am
myself
no
more
and
no
less
and
all
the
metaphysical
jargon
in
the
world
wo
prevent
my
shins
from
bleeding
wet
red
blood
when
i
bark
them
against
a
stone
you
do
believe
in
the
supernatural
then
asked
may
most
emphatically
not
how
extraordinary
and
how
if
i
may
ask
do
you
fill
the
terrible
vacuum
in
your
life
that
such
a
denial
must
create
i
have
never
been
conscious
of
such
a
vacuum
i
was
a
sceptic
from
my
youth
up
no
doubt
those
who
were
nurtured
in
superstition
when
reason
at
last
conquers
and
they
break
away
may
experience
a
temporary
blank
but
the
wonders
of
nature
and
the
achievements
of
man
and
the
demands
of
the
suffering
world
these
should
be
enough
to
fill
any
blank
for
a
reasonable
creature
if
such
are
your
opinions
you
will
fail
here
declared
the
clergyman
positively
why
do
you
feel
so
sure
of
that
because
you
are
faced
with
facts
that
have
no
material
explanation
they
are
supernatural
or
supernormal
if
you
prefer
the
word
world
at
a
time
is
a
very
good
motto
in
my
judgment
replied
hardcastle
we
will
exhaust
the
possibilities
of
this
world
first
sir
they
have
already
been
exhausted
only
a
simple
straightforward
question
awaits
your
reply
do
you
believe
in
another
world
or
do
you
not
in
the
endless
punishment
or
the
endless
happiness
of
men
and
women
after
they
are
dead
if
you
like
to
confuse
the
issue
in
that
way
you
are
at
liberty
of
course
to
do
so
as
a
christian
i
can
not
demur
the
problem
for
the
rationalist
is
this
how
does
he
ignore
the
deeply
rooted
and
universal
conviction
that
there
is
a
life
to
come
is
such
a
sanguine
assurance
planted
in
the
mind
of
even
the
lowest
savage
for
nothing
where
did
the
aborigines
win
that
expectation
my
answer
embraces
the
whole
question
from
my
own
point
of
view
replied
hardcastle
the
savages
got
their
idea
of
dual
personality
from
phenomena
of
nature
which
they
were
unable
to
explain
from
their
dreams
from
their
own
shadows
on
the
earth
and
reflections
in
water
from
the
stroke
of
the
lightning
and
the
crash
of
the
thunder
from
the
echo
of
their
own
voices
thrown
back
to
them
from
crags
and
cliffs
these
things
created
their
superstitions
ignorance
bred
terror
and
terror
bred
gods
and
demons
first
out
of
the
forces
of
nature
that
is
the
appalling
mental
legacy
handed
down
in
varying
shapes
to
all
the
children
of
men
we
labor
under
them
to
this
day
you
would
dare
to
say
our
most
sacred
verities
have
sprung
from
the
dreams
of
savages
hardcastle
smiled
it
is
true
and
dreams
we
further
know
are
often
the
result
of
indigestion
early
man
did
understand
the
art
of
cookery
and
therefore
no
doubt
his
stomach
had
a
great
deal
to
put
up
with
we
have
to
thank
his
bear
steaks
and
wolf
chops
for
a
great
deal
of
our
cherished
nonsense
no
doubt
sir
walter
marking
the
clergyman
flashing
eyes
changed
the
subject
and
septimus
may
who
observed
his
concern
restrained
a
bitter
answer
but
he
despaired
of
the
detective
from
that
moment
and
proposed
to
himself
a
future
assault
on
such
detested
modern
opinions
when
opportunity
occurred
after
breakfast
hardcastle
begged
for
a
private
interview
with
the
master
of
chadlands
and
for
two
hours
sat
in
his
study
and
took
him
through
the
case
from
the
beginning
he
put
various
questions
concerning
the
members
of
the
recent
house
party
and
presently
begged
that
henry
lennox
might
join
them
i
should
like
to
hear
the
account
of
what
passed
on
the
night
between
him
and
captain
may
he
said
henry
joined
them
and
detailed
his
experience
while
he
talked
hardcastle
appraised
him
and
perceived
that
certain
nebulous
opinions
which
had
begun
to
crystallize
in
his
own
mind
could
have
no
real
foundation
the
detective
believed
that
he
was
confronted
with
a
common
murder
and
on
hearing
henry
history
as
part
of
sir
walter
story
with
the
rest
perceived
that
the
old
lover
of
mary
lennox
had
last
seen
her
husband
alive
had
drunk
with
him
and
been
the
first
to
find
him
dead
might
not
henry
have
found
an
eastern
poison
in
mesopotamia
but
his
conversation
with
the
young
man
and
the
unconscious
revelation
of
henry
himself
shattered
the
idea
lennox
was
innocent
enough
for
a
moment
the
information
of
uncle
and
nephew
exhausted
hardcastle
returned
to
the
matter
of
the
breakfast
discussion
you
will
of
course
understand
that
i
am
quite
satisfied
a
material
and
physical
explanation
exists
for
this
unfortunate
event
he
said
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
am
unprepared
to
entertain
any
supernatural
theory
of
the
business
i
do
believe
myself
in
ghosts
because
in
my
experience
and
it
is
pretty
wide
ghost
stories
break
down
badly
under
anything
like
skilled
and
independent
examination
there
is
a
natural
reason
for
what
has
happened
as
there
is
a
natural
reason
for
everything
that
happens
we
talk
of
unnatural
things
happening
but
that
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
nothing
can
happen
that
is
not
natural
what
we
call
nature
embraces
every
conceivable
action
or
event
or
possibility
we
may
fail
to
fathom
a
mystery
and
we
know
that
a
thousand
things
happen
every
day
and
night
that
seem
beyond
the
power
of
our
wits
to
explain
but
that
is
only
to
say
our
wits
are
limited
i
hold
however
that
very
few
things
happen
which
do
not
yield
an
explanation
sooner
or
later
if
approached
by
those
best
trained
to
examine
them
without
predisposition
or
prejudice
and
i
earnestly
hope
that
this
tragic
business
will
give
up
its
secret
may
you
prove
the
correctness
of
your
opinions
hardcastle
answered
sir
walter
would
you
like
to
see
the
grey
room
now
i
should
though
i
tell
you
frankly
it
is
not
in
the
grey
room
that
i
shall
find
what
i
seek
it
does
not
particularly
interest
me
and
for
this
reason
i
do
not
associate
captain
may
death
in
any
way
with
the
earlier
tragedy
that
of
the
hospital
nurse
forrester
it
is
a
coincidence
in
my
opinion
and
probably
if
physiology
were
a
more
perfect
science
than
in
my
experience
of
examinations
it
has
proved
to
be
the
reason
for
the
lady
death
would
have
appeared
and
for
that
matter
the
reason
for
captain
may
death
also
to
say
there
was
no
reason
is
of
course
absurd
nothing
ever
yet
happened
or
could
happen
without
a
reason
the
springs
of
action
were
arrested
and
the
machine
instantly
ran
down
but
a
man
is
not
a
clock
which
can
be
stopped
and
reveal
no
sign
of
the
thing
that
stopped
it
life
is
a
far
more
complex
matter
than
a
and
if
we
knew
more
we
might
not
be
faced
with
so
many
worthless
reports
but
sir
howard
fellowes
is
not
often
beaten
i
repeat
however
i
do
not
associate
the
two
deaths
in
the
grey
room
or
connect
them
as
the
result
of
one
and
the
same
cause
i
do
not
state
this
as
a
fact
beyond
dispute
but
that
for
the
present
is
my
assumption
the
gap
in
time
seems
too
considerable
i
suspect
other
causes
and
shall
have
to
make
researches
into
the
dead
man
past
life
i
should
wish
also
to
examine
all
his
property
he
has
been
in
foreign
countries
and
may
have
brought
back
something
concerning
the
nature
of
which
he
was
ignorant
he
may
possess
enemies
of
whom
neither
you
nor
may
have
heard
anything
your
knowledge
of
him
recollect
extends
over
only
a
short
time
eight
or
ten
months
i
suppose
i
shall
visit
his
ship
and
his
cabin
in
indomitable
also
and
learn
all
that
his
fellow
officers
can
tell
me
sir
walter
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
now
nearly
one
he
said
and
at
two
we
usually
take
luncheon
what
would
you
wish
to
do
between
now
and
then
none
here
but
ourselves
and
my
butler
an
old
friend
in
all
my
secrets
knows
you
have
come
professionally
i
concealed
the
fact
and
called
you
at
your
wish
though
they
can
not
fail
to
suspect
i
fear
thank
you
i
will
see
the
room
then
and
look
round
the
place
perhaps
after
luncheon
if
she
feels
equal
to
the
task
may
will
give
me
a
private
interview
i
want
to
learn
everything
possible
concerning
your
late
his
career
before
jutland
his
philosophy
of
life
his
habits
and
his
friends
she
will
very
gladly
tell
you
everything
she
can
they
ascended
to
the
grey
room
not
the
traditional
haunt
of
spooks
certainly
said
peter
hardcastle
as
they
entered
the
bright
and
cheerful
chamber
the
day
was
clear
and
from
the
southern
window
unclouded
sunshine
came
nothing
is
changed
he
asked
nothing
the
room
remains
as
it
has
been
for
many
years
kindly
describe
exactly
where
captain
may
was
found
perhaps
lennox
will
imitate
his
posture
if
he
remembers
it
remember
it
i
shall
never
forget
it
said
henry
i
first
saw
him
from
below
he
was
looking
out
of
the
open
window
and
kneeling
here
on
this
seat
let
us
open
the
window
then
the
situation
and
attitude
of
the
dead
on
discovery
were
imitated
and
hardcastle
examined
the
spot
then
he
himself
occupied
the
position
and
looked
out
i
will
ask
for
a
ladder
presently
and
examine
the
face
of
the
wall
ivy
i
see
ivy
has
told
me
some
very
interesting
secrets
before
sir
walter
i
dare
say
it
has
if
you
will
remind
me
at
luncheon
i
can
tell
you
a
truly
amazing
story
about
ivy
a
story
of
life
and
death
a
man
could
easily
go
and
come
by
this
window
not
easily
i
think
said
henry
it
is
rather
more
than
feet
to
the
ground
how
do
you
know
that
the
police
who
made
the
original
inquiry
and
were
stopped
as
you
will
remember
from
scotland
yard
measured
it
the
second
morning
afterwards
on
monday
but
they
did
not
examine
the
face
of
the
wall
i
think
not
they
dropped
a
measure
from
the
window
the
other
pursued
his
examination
of
the
room
old
furniture
he
said
very
old
evidently
it
was
collected
in
spain
by
my
grandfather
many
years
ago
valuable
no
doubt
i
understand
so
wonderful
carving
and
this
door
it
is
not
a
door
but
a
cupboard
in
the
solid
wall
sir
walter
opened
the
receptacle
as
he
spoke
the
cupboard
some
six
and
a
half
feet
high
was
empty
at
the
back
of
it
appeared
a
row
of
pegs
for
clothes
i
can
finish
with
the
room
for
the
present
at
any
rate
in
an
hour
gentlemen
said
hardcastle
i
spend
the
time
here
till
luncheon
had
your
any
interest
in
old
furniture
sir
walter
none
whatever
to
my
knowledge
he
was
interested
poor
fellow
not
in
the
contents
but
in
the
evil
reputation
of
the
room
its
bad
name
dated
back
far
beyond
the
occupation
of
my
family
captain
may
laughed
at
my
mistrust
and
as
you
know
he
came
here
contrary
to
my
express
wishes
in
order
that
he
might
chaff
me
next
morning
over
my
superstition
he
wanted
clear
its
character
as
he
said
hardcastle
was
turning
over
the
stack
of
old
in
tarnished
frames
family
portraits
yes
you
mistrusted
the
room
yourself
sir
walter
after
nurse
forrester
death
i
did
not
before
but
while
attaching
no
importance
myself
to
the
tradition
i
respected
it
nobody
else
ever
spent
a
night
here
after
the
lady
death
nobody
of
that
i
am
quite
certain
have
you
not
left
the
house
since
frequently
i
generally
spend
march
april
and
may
on
the
continent
in
france
or
italy
but
the
house
is
never
closed
and
my
people
are
responsible
to
me
the
room
is
always
locked
and
when
i
am
not
in
residence
abraham
masters
my
butler
keeps
the
key
he
shares
my
own
feelings
so
far
as
the
grey
room
is
concerned
the
detective
nodded
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
strange
fact
the
force
of
superstition
he
said
it
seems
to
feed
on
night
where
ghosts
are
involved
what
i
suppose
credulous
people
call
powers
of
darkness
but
have
you
ever
asked
yourself
why
the
spiritualists
must
work
in
the
dark
to
simplify
their
operations
no
doubt
and
make
it
easier
for
the
spirits
and
themselves
but
why
is
the
night
sacred
to
apparitions
and
supernatural
phenomena
generally
tradition
associates
them
with
those
hours
spiritualists
say
it
is
easier
for
spectres
to
appear
in
the
dark
by
reason
of
their
material
composition
it
is
then
that
we
find
the
most
authentic
accounts
of
their
manifestations
yes
because
at
that
time
human
vitality
is
lowest
and
human
reason
weakest
darkness
itself
has
a
curious
and
depressing
effect
on
the
minds
of
many
people
i
have
won
my
advantage
from
that
more
than
once
i
once
proved
a
very
notorious
crime
by
the
crude
expedient
of
impersonating
the
criminal
victim
a
murdered
woman
and
appearing
to
him
at
night
before
a
concealed
witness
but
spirits
are
doomed
the
present
extraordinary
wave
of
superstition
and
the
immense
prosperity
of
the
dealers
in
the
is
a
direct
result
of
the
war
they
are
profiteers
every
one
of
them
crystal
gazers
mediums
fortune
tellers
and
the
rest
they
are
reaping
a
rare
harvest
for
the
moment
we
punish
the
humbler
rogues
but
we
do
punish
the
fools
who
go
to
see
them
if
i
had
my
way
the
man
or
woman
who
visited
the
modern
witch
or
wizard
should
get
six
months
in
the
second
division
fools
should
be
punished
oftener
for
their
folly
but
education
will
sweep
these
things
into
the
limbo
of
man
ignorance
and
mental
infancy
ghosts
can
not
stand
the
light
of
knowledge
any
better
than
they
can
operate
in
the
light
of
day
you
are
very
positive
mr
hardcastle
not
often
on
this
subject
yes
sir
walter
lennox
i
have
seen
too
much
of
the
practitioners
metaphysics
is
largely
to
blame
physics
the
strong
you
will
find
far
too
merciful
to
metaphysics
the
weak
sir
walter
found
himself
regarding
hardcastle
with
dislike
he
spoke
quietly
yet
there
was
something
mocking
and
annoying
in
his
dogmatism
you
must
discuss
the
subject
with
may
who
breakfasted
with
us
he
will
i
think
have
no
difficulty
in
maintaining
the
contrary
opinion
they
never
have
any
difficulty
clergymen
i
mean
and
argument
with
them
is
vain
because
we
can
not
find
common
ground
to
start
from
what
is
the
reverend
gentleman
theory
he
believes
that
the
room
holds
an
invisible
and
conscious
presence
permitted
to
exercise
powers
of
a
physical
character
antagonistic
to
human
life
he
is
guarded
you
see
and
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
whether
this
being
is
working
for
good
or
evil
but
it
has
done
evil
surely
evil
from
our
standpoint
but
since
the
supreme
creator
made
this
creature
as
well
as
he
made
us
therefore
may
holds
that
we
are
not
justified
in
declaring
its
operations
are
evil
save
from
a
human
standpoint
how
was
he
related
to
captain
thomas
may
his
father
peter
hardcastle
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
spoke
again
have
you
observed
how
many
of
the
sons
of
the
clergy
go
into
the
navy
or
merchant
marine
i
have
not
they
do
however
sir
walter
began
to
dislike
the
detective
more
than
before
we
will
leave
you
now
he
said
you
will
find
me
in
my
study
if
you
want
me
that
bell
communicates
with
the
servants
the
lock
of
the
door
was
broken
when
we
forced
our
way
in
and
has
not
been
mended
but
you
can
close
the
door
if
you
wish
to
do
so
it
has
been
kept
open
since
and
the
electric
light
always
turned
on
at
night
many
thanks
i
will
consider
a
point
or
two
here
and
rejoin
you
was
the
chimney
examined
no
it
would
not
admit
a
human
being
then
sir
walter
and
his
nephew
left
the
room
and
hardcastle
waiting
until
they
were
out
of
earshot
shut
the
door
and
thrust
a
heavy
chair
against
it
they
heard
no
more
of
him
for
an
hour
and
joined
mary
and
septimus
may
who
were
walking
on
the
terrace
together
the
former
was
eager
to
learn
the
detective
opinions
but
her
husband
father
had
already
warned
her
that
peter
hardcastle
was
doomed
to
fail
the
four
walked
up
and
down
together
and
prince
sir
walter
ancient
spaniel
went
beside
them
henry
told
his
cousin
the
nature
of
their
conversation
and
the
direction
in
which
the
professional
inquiry
seemed
to
turn
he
wants
to
see
you
and
hear
everything
you
can
tell
him
about
dear
tom
past
he
said
of
course
i
will
tell
him
everything
and
what
i
do
not
know
may
will
remember
he
is
very
quiet
and
very
about
some
things
but
jolly
positive
about
others
your
wo
get
far
with
him
he
scoffs
at
any
supernatural
explanation
of
our
terrible
loss
may
overheard
this
remark
as
i
have
already
told
mary
his
failure
is
assured
he
is
wasting
his
time
and
i
knew
he
probably
would
do
so
before
he
came
not
to
such
a
man
however
clever
he
may
be
will
an
explanation
be
vouchsafed
i
would
rather
trust
an
innocent
child
to
discover
these
things
than
such
a
person
he
is
lost
in
his
own
conceit
and
harbors
vain
ideas
there
is
something
about
him
i
cordially
dislike
already
confessed
sir
walter
and
yet
it
is
a
most
unreasonable
dislike
on
my
part
for
he
is
exceedingly
well
mannered
speaks
and
conducts
himself
like
a
gentleman
and
does
nothing
that
can
offend
the
most
sensitive
a
prejudice
uncle
walter
perhaps
it
is
henry
yet
i
rarely
feel
prejudice
call
it
rather
an
intuition
said
the
clergyman
what
your
antipathetic
attitude
means
is
that
you
already
unconsciously
know
this
man
is
not
going
to
avail
and
that
his
assumption
of
superiority
in
the
matter
of
knowledge
his
opinions
and
lack
of
faith
will
defeat
him
if
nothing
else
does
he
approaches
his
problem
in
an
infidel
spirit
and
consequently
the
problem
will
evade
his
skill
because
such
skill
is
not
merely
futile
in
this
matter
but
actually
destructive
mary
left
them
and
they
discussed
the
probable
chances
of
the
detective
without
convincing
each
other
henry
who
had
been
much
impressed
by
hardcastle
argued
in
his
favor
but
septimus
may
was
obdurate
and
sir
walter
evidently
inclined
to
agree
with
him
the
young
men
think
the
old
men
fools
and
the
old
men
know
the
young
ones
are
said
sir
walter
but
he
is
not
young
uncle
he
forty
he
told
me
so
i
thought
him
ten
years
less
and
he
spoke
with
the
dogmatism
of
youth
only
on
that
subject
which
happens
to
be
the
one
subject
of
all
others
on
which
we
have
a
right
to
demand
an
open
and
reverent
mind
said
the
clergyman
henry
noticed
that
sir
walter
spoke
almost
spitefully
well
at
any
rate
he
thought
rather
small
beer
of
the
grey
room
he
felt
quite
sure
that
the
secret
lay
outside
it
he
was
going
to
exhaust
the
possibilities
of
the
place
in
no
time
as
he
spoke
the
gong
sounded
and
prince
pricking
his
ears
led
the
way
to
the
open
french
window
of
the
call
our
friend
henry
said
his
uncle
and
young
lennox
glad
of
the
opportunity
entered
the
house
he
desired
a
word
with
hardcastle
in
private
and
ascended
to
join
him
the
door
of
the
grey
room
was
still
closed
and
henry
found
some
obstacle
within
that
prevented
it
from
yielding
to
his
hand
at
once
disturbed
by
this
incident
he
did
not
stand
upon
ceremony
he
pushed
the
door
which
gave
before
him
and
he
perceived
that
a
heavy
chair
had
been
thrust
against
it
his
noisy
entrance
challenged
no
response
and
looking
round
it
appeared
for
an
instant
that
the
room
was
empty
but
lowering
his
eyes
he
saw
first
the
detective
open
notebook
and
stylograph
lying
upon
the
ground
then
he
discovered
peter
hardcastle
himself
upon
his
face
with
his
arms
stretched
out
before
him
he
lay
beside
the
hearth
motionless
lennox
stooped
supported
and
turned
him
over
he
was
still
warm
and
relaxed
in
every
limb
but
quite
unconscious
and
apparently
dead
an
expression
of
surprise
marked
his
face
and
the
corner
of
each
open
eye
had
not
yet
lost
its
lustre
but
the
pupil
was
much
dilated
chapter

from

henry
lennox
suffered
as
he
had
not
suffered
even
during
the
horrors
of
war
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
fear
he
lowered
the
unconscious
man
to
the
ground
and
knew
that
he
was
dead
for
he
had
looked
on
sudden
death
too
often
to
feel
in
any
doubt
others
however
were
not
so
ready
to
credit
this
and
after
he
hastened
downstairs
with
his
evil
message
both
sir
walter
and
masters
found
it
hard
to
believe
him
when
he
descended
his
uncle
and
may
were
standing
at
the
dining
room
door
waiting
for
him
and
peter
hardcastle
mary
had
just
joined
them
he
dead
was
all
the
youth
could
say
then
thoroughly
unnerved
he
fell
into
a
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
again
through
his
agency
had
a
dead
man
been
discovered
in
the
grey
room
in
each
case
his
had
been
the
eyes
first
to
confront
a
tragedy
and
his
the
voice
to
report
it
the
fact
persisted
in
his
mind
with
a
dark
obstinacy
as
though
some
great
personal
tribulation
had
befallen
him
mary
stopped
with
her
cousin
and
asked
terrified
questions
while
sir
walter
calling
to
masters
hastened
upstairs
followed
by
septimus
may
the
clergyman
was
also
agitated
yet
in
his
concern
there
persisted
a
note
almost
of
triumph
it
is
there
he
cried
it
is
close
to
us
watching
us
powerless
to
touch
either
you
or
me
but
this
unhappy
sceptic
proved
an
easy
victim
would
to
god
i
had
listened
to
you
yesterday
said
sir
walter
then
this
innocent
man
had
not
perhaps
been
snatched
from
life
you
were
directed
not
to
listen
your
heart
was
hardened
his
hour
had
come
i
can
not
believe
it
we
may
restore
him
it
is
impossible
that
he
can
be
dead
in
a
moment
they
stood
over
the
detective
and
masters
and
fred
caunter
with
courage
and
presence
of
mind
carried
him
out
into
the
corridor
the
butler
spoke
run
for
the
brandy
fred
he
said
we
must
get
some
down
his
neck
if
we
can
i
do
feel
the
gentleman
heart
but
it
may
not
have
stopped
he
warm
enough
the
footman
obeyed
and
hardcastle
was
laid
upon
his
back
then
sir
walter
directed
masters
hold
his
head
up
it
may
be
better
for
him
they
waited
and
during
the
few
moments
before
caunter
returned
sir
walter
spoke
again
his
mind
wandered
backward
and
seemed
for
the
moment
incapable
of
grasping
the
fact
before
him
almost
the
last
thing
the
man
said
was
to
ask
me
why
ghosts
haunted
the
night
rather
than
the
day
poor
fool
poor
fool
he
is
answered
replied
the
priest
all
attempts
to
restore
the
vanished
life
proved
useless
and
they
carried
hardcastle
downstairs
presently
henry
lennox
was
already
gone
for
the
doctor
and
when
within
an
hour
mannering
joined
them
he
could
only
pronounce
that
the
man
was
dead
no
sign
of
life
rewarded
their
protracted
efforts
to
restore
circulation
how
he
had
come
by
his
end
how
death
had
broken
into
his
frame
it
was
impossible
to
determine
not
an
unusual
sign
marked
the
body
it
revealed
neither
wound
nor
outward
evidence
of
shock
the
case
seemed
parallel
with
that
of
thomas
may
death
had
struck
the
man
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
dropped
him
where
he
stood
making
his
notes
by
the
fireplace
whereupon
a
complication
faced
mannering
mary
came
to
him
where
he
spoke
in
the
library
with
sir
walter
and
henry
lennox
she
implored
him
to
use
his
influence
with
her
for
they
had
forgotten
septimus
may
while
hastily
deliberating
as
to
what
telegrams
should
be
dispatched
but
now
they
learned
that
may
was
in
the
grey
boom
and
refused
to
leave
it
he
is
very
excited
she
said
he
is
walking
up
and
down
speaking
aloud
quoting
texts
from
scripture
addressing
the
spirit
that
he
believes
to
be
listening
to
him
it
would
be
grotesque
were
it
not
so
horrible
he
must
be
made
to
come
away
he
is
justified
of
his
faith
declared
sir
walter
i
have
withstood
him
until
now
but
i
can
do
so
no
longer
indeed
you
must
he
is
playing
with
death
said
mannering
they
sought
tom
father
to
find
him
as
mary
had
said
walking
up
and
down
with
fierce
joy
of
battle
on
his
thin
stern
face
and
in
his
shining
eyes
now
shall
the
powers
of
light
triumph
and
the
will
of
god
be
done
he
said
to
them
he
made
no
demur
however
when
they
drew
him
away
the
future
is
mine
he
declared
and
grew
calm
you
can
not
stand
between
me
and
my
duty
again
sir
walter
you
have
gravely
erred
and
this
is
the
result
of
your
error
but
you
will
not
err
a
second
time
his
excitation
ceased
and
it
was
he
who
proposed
that
they
should
return
to
their
forgotten
meal
in
the
matter
of
the
man
just
dead
he
revealed
an
indifference
almost
callous
his
god
will
justly
judge
him
according
to
his
deserving
he
declared
if
he
sinned
through
ignorance
and
false
teaching
his
punishment
will
not
be
heavy
if
he
hardened
his
heart
against
truth
and
rejected
the
faith
from
pride
but
even
then
the
father
of
mercy
may
pardon
him
he
has
failed
even
as
i
knew
he
must
and
paid
a
terrible
penalty
for
failure
sir
walter
sorely
stricken
hardly
heard
the
other
he
ate
a
little
at
mary
entreaty
then
driven
by
some
impulse
to
leave
his
and
court
solitude
excused
himself
begged
lennox
and
mannering
to
bring
him
news
when
the
telegram
dispatched
to
scotland
yard
was
answered
and
prepared
to
leave
them
as
he
rose
he
marked
his
old
spaniel
standing
whimpering
by
his
side
what
is
the
matter
with
prince
he
asked
he
has
not
had
his
dinner
said
mary
let
him
be
fed
at
once
answered
her
father
and
went
out
alone
she
rose
to
follow
him
immediately
but
mannering
who
had
stopped
and
was
with
them
begged
her
not
to
do
so
leave
him
to
himself
he
said
this
has
shaken
your
father
as
well
it
may
he
all
right
make
him
take
his
bromide
and
let
nobody
do
anything
to
worry
him
the
master
of
chadlands
meantime
went
afield
walked
half
a
mile
to
a
favorite
spot
and
sat
down
upon
a
seat
that
he
had
there
erected
a
storm
was
blowing
up
from
the
and
the
weather
of
his
mind
welcomed
it
he
alternated
between
bewilderment
and
indignation
his
own
philosophy
and
trust
in
the
ordered
foundations
of
human
existence
threatened
to
fail
him
entirely
before
this
second
stroke
it
seemed
that
the
punctual
universe
was
suddenly
turned
upside
down
and
had
emptied
a
vial
of
horror
upon
his
innocent
head
reality
was
a
thing
of
the
past
a
nightmare
had
taken
its
place
a
nightmare
from
which
there
was
no
waking
he
considered
the
stability
of
his
days
a
lifetime
followed
upon
high
principles
and
founded
on
religious
convictions
that
had
comforted
his
sorrows
and
countenanced
his
joys
it
seemed
a
trial
undeserved
that
in
his
old
age
he
should
be
thrust
upon
a
pinnacle
of
publicity
forced
into
the
public
eye
robbed
of
dignity
denied
the
privacy
he
esteemed
as
the
most
precious
privilege
that
wealth
could
command
stability
was
destroyed
to
count
upon
the
morrow
seemed
impossible
his
thought
strung
to
a
new
morbidity
unknown
till
now
ran
on
and
pictured
with
painful
vivid
stroke
upon
stroke
the
insufferable
series
of
events
that
lay
before
him
life
was
become
a
bizarre
and
brutal
business
for
a
man
of
fine
feeling
he
would
be
thrust
into
the
pitiless
mouth
of
called
to
appear
before
tribunals
subjected
to
an
inquisition
of
his
made
to
endure
a
notoriety
infinitely
odious
even
in
anticipation
indeed
sir
walter
simple
intellect
wallowed
in
anticipation
and
so
suffered
much
that
given
exercise
of
restraint
he
might
have
escaped
altogether
he
was
brave
enough
but
personal
bravery
would
not
be
called
for
he
sat
now
staring
dumbly
at
an
imaginary
series
of
events
abominable
and
unseemly
in
every
particular
to
his
order
of
mind
he
was
so
concerned
with
what
the
future
must
hold
in
store
for
him
that
for
a
time
the
present
quite
escaped
his
thoughts
he
returned
to
it
however
and
it
was
almost
with
the
shock
of
a
new
surprise
he
remembered
that
peter
hardcastle
a
man
of
european
repute
had
just
died
in
his
house
but
he
could
not
in
the
least
realize
the
new
tragedy
he
had
as
yet
barely
grasped
the
truth
of
his
end
and
still
often
found
himself
expecting
tom
footfall
and
his
jolly
voice
that
such
an
abundant
vitality
was
stilled
that
such
an
infectious
laugh
would
never
sound
again
on
mortal
ear
he
yet
sometimes
found
it
hard
to
believe
but
now
it
seemed
that
the
impact
of
this
second
blow
rammed
home
the
first
he
brooded
upon
his
dead
and
it
was
long
before
he
returned
to
the
event
of
that
day
a
thought
struck
him
and
though
elementary
enough
it
seemed
to
sir
walter
an
important
conclusion
there
could
be
no
shadow
of
doubt
that
tom
may
and
peter
hardcastle
had
died
by
the
same
secret
force
he
felt
that
he
must
remember
this
again
he
puzzled
and
then
decided
with
himself
that
if
he
meant
to
keep
sane
he
must
practice
faith
and
trust
in
god
septimus
may
had
said
that
such
unparalleled
things
sometimes
happened
in
the
world
to
try
man
faith
doubtless
he
was
right
henceforth
the
old
man
determined
to
stand
firmly
on
the
side
of
the
supernatural
with
the
priest
he
went
further
and
blamed
his
scepticism
it
had
cost
the
world
a
valuable
life
he
could
not
indeed
be
censured
for
that
in
any
court
of
inquiry
sceptical
men
would
doubtless
say
that
he
had
done
rightly
in
refusing
may
his
experiment
but
sir
walter
now
convinced
himself
that
he
had
done
wrongly
at
such
a
time
with
landmarks
vanishing
and
all
accepted
laws
of
matter
resolved
into
chaos
there
remained
only
god
to
trust
such
a
burden
as
this
was
not
to
be
borne
by
any
mortal
and
sir
walter
determined
that
he
would
not
bear
it
were
we
not
told
to
cast
our
tribulations
before
the
almighty
here
if
ever
was
a
situation
beyond
the
power
of
human
mind
to
approach
unless
a
man
walked
humbly
with
his
hand
in
his
maker
septimus
may
had
been
emphatically
right
sir
walter
repeated
this
conviction
to
himself
again
and
again
like
a
child
he
descended
to
details
presently
the
hidden
being
that
it
had
been
implicitly
agreed
could
only
operate
by
night
in
the
grey
room
proved
equally
potent
under
noonday
sun
but
why
should
it
be
otherwise
to
limit
its
activities
was
to
limit
its
powers
and
the
almighty
alone
knew
what
powers
had
been
granted
to
it
he
shrank
from
further
inquiries
or
investigations
on
any
but
a
religious
basis
he
was
now
convinced
that
no
natural
explanation
would
exist
for
what
had
happened
in
the
grey
room
and
he
believed
that
only
through
the
paths
of
christian
faith
would
peace
return
to
him
or
his
house
then
the
present
dropped
out
of
his
thoughts
they
wandered
into
the
past
and
he
concerned
himself
with
his
wife
she
it
was
who
had
taught
him
to
care
for
foreign
travel
until
his
marriage
he
had
hardly
left
england
save
when
yachting
with
friends
and
an
occasional
glimpse
of
a
mediterranean
port
was
all
that
sir
walter
knew
of
the
earth
outside
his
own
country
but
he
remembered
with
gratitude
the
opportunities
won
from
her
he
had
taken
her
round
the
world
and
found
himself
much
the
richer
in
great
memories
for
that
experience
he
was
still
thinking
when
mary
found
him
with
his
old
dog
asleep
at
his
feet
she
brought
him
a
coat
and
umbrella
for
the
threatened
storm
advanced
swiftly
under
clouds
laden
with
rain
reluctantly
enough
he
returned
to
the
present
a
telegram
had
been
received
from
london
directing
mannering
to
reach
the
nearest
telephone
and
communicate
direct
the
doctor
was
gone
to
newton
abbot
and
nothing
could
be
done
until
he
came
back
not
knowing
what
had
occupied
sir
walter
mind
mary
urged
him
to
leave
chadlands
without
delay
put
the
place
into
the
hands
of
the
police
and
take
me
with
you
she
said
nothing
can
be
gained
by
our
stopping
and
after
this
it
is
certain
the
authorities
will
not
rest
until
they
have
made
a
far
more
searching
examination
than
has
ever
yet
been
carried
out
they
will
feel
this
disaster
a
challenge
thankfully
i
would
go
he
answered
most
thankfully
i
would
avoid
what
is
hanging
over
my
head
it
was
terrible
enough
when
your
dear
husband
died
but
now
we
shall
be
the
centre
of
interest
to
half
england
every
instinct
cries
to
me
to
get
out
of
it
but
obviously
that
is
impossible
even
were
i
permitted
to
do
so
it
is
the
duty
of
the
police
to
suspect
every
man
and
woman
under
my
roof
myself
with
the
rest
these
appalling
things
have
occurred
in
my
home
and
i
must
bear
the
brunt
of
them
and
stand
up
to
all
that
they
mean
no
lennox
ever
ran
from
his
duty
however
painful
it
might
be
the
death
of
this
man
so
eminent
in
his
calling
will
attract
tremendous
attention
and
be
as
you
say
a
sort
of
direct
challenge
to
the
authorities
for
whom
he
worked
they
will
resent
this
second
tragedy
and
with
good
reason
the
poor
man
though
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
admired
him
was
a
force
for
good
in
the
world
and
his
peculiar
genius
was
devoted
to
the
detection
of
crime
and
punishment
of
criminals
a
very
worthy
occupation
however
painful
to
our
ideas
they
sat
in
the
library
now
and
henry
lennox
spoke
to
his
uncle
with
his
eye
on
the
window
waiting
for
the
sight
of
the
doctor
car
they
want
to
tear
the
place
down
very
likely
they
certainly
have
no
mercy
on
the
stones
and
mortar
any
more
than
they
will
on
us
they
can
spare
themselves
that
trouble
and
you
your
fears
declared
septimus
may
who
had
joined
them
it
is
impossible
that
they
will
be
here
until
meantime
it
is
easy
to
see
what
they
will
do
proceeded
young
lennox
and
what
they
will
think
also
nor
can
we
prevent
them
even
if
we
wanted
to
i
image
their
theory
will
be
this
they
will
suppose
that
hardcastle
left
in
that
room
alone
was
actually
on
the
track
of
those
responsible
for
tom
death
they
will
guess
that
in
some
way
or
by
some
accident
he
surprised
the
author
of
the
tragedy
and
the
assassin
seeing
his
danger
resorted
to
the
same
unknown
means
of
murder
as
before
they
may
imagine
some
hidden
lunatic
concealed
here
whose
presence
is
only
known
to
some
of
us
they
may
suspect
a
homicidal
maniac
in
me
or
my
uncle
or
masters
or
anybody
certainly
they
will
seek
a
natural
explanation
and
flout
the
idea
of
any
other
the
clergyman
protested
but
henry
was
not
prepared
to
traverse
the
old
ground
again
i
have
as
much
right
to
my
opinions
as
you
to
yours
he
said
and
i
am
positive
this
is
man
work
then
mary
announced
that
mannering
car
was
in
sight
the
library
windows
opened
on
the
western
side
of
the
house
and
afforded
a
view
of
the
main
drive
along
which
the
doctor
little
hooded
car
came
flying
like
a
dead
leaf
in
a
storm
but
it
was
not
alone
a
hospital
motor
ambulance
followed
behind
it
they
soon
learned
of
curious
things
and
the
house
was
first
thrown
into
a
great
bustle
and
then
restored
to
peace
mannering
had
spoken
for
half
an
hour
with
london
and
received
directions
that
puzzled
him
not
a
little
by
their
implication
for
a
moment
he
seemed
unwilling
to
speak
before
mary
then
he
begged
her
bluntly
to
leave
them
for
a
while
it
this
way
he
said
when
she
was
gone
they
harboring
a
mad
idea
in
london
though
of
course
the
facts
will
presently
convince
them
to
the
contrary
surely
i
must
know
death
when
i
see
it
but
a
divisional
surgeon
or
some
other
medical
official
directs
me
to
bring
this
poor
fellow
body
to
london
every
care
must
be
taken
warmth
and
air
applied
and
so
on
they
evidently
got
a
notion
that
since
life
appears
to
go
so
easily
in
the
grey
room
and
leave
no
scratch
or
wound
either
life
has
not
gone
at
all
or
that
it
may
be
within
the
power
of
science
to
bring
it
back
again
in
a
sense
this
is
a
reflection
upon
me
as
though
it
were
possible
that
i
could
make
any
mistake
between
death
and
suspended
animation
but
i
must
do
as
ordered
i
travel
to
town
with
the
dead
man
and
if
they
find
he
is
anything
but
dead
as
a
doornail
i
the
doctor
was
writing
his
reminiscences
the
recollections
of
a
country
physician
and
he
could
not
fail
to
welcome
these
events
for
they
were
destined
to
lend
extraordinary
attraction
to
a
volume
otherwise
not
destined
to
be
much
out
of
the
common
he
spoke
again
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
accompany
me
lennox
i
shall
have
a
police
inspector
from
plymouth
but
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
if
you
could
come
moreover
you
would
help
me
in
london
i
come
up
certainly
you
do
mind
uncle
walter
not
if
mannering
wishes
it
we
owe
him
more
than
we
can
ever
repay
anything
that
we
can
do
to
lessen
his
labors
ought
to
be
done
i
should
certainly
welcome
your
company
a
small
saloon
carriage
is
to
be
put
on
to
the
plymouth
train
that
leaves
newton
for
london
before
midnight
we
shall
be
met
at
paddington
by
some
of
their
doctors
and
as
to
chadlands
four
men
arrive
morning
by
the
same
train
that
peter
hardcastle
came
down
in
last
night
we
shall
pass
them
on
the
way
they
will
take
charge
both
of
the
grey
room
and
the
house
as
soon
as
they
arrive
and
they
will
be
welcome
i
would
myself
willingly
pull
down
chadlands
to
the
foundations
if
by
so
doing
i
could
discover
the
truth
it
demands
no
such
sacrifice
declared
may
who
had
listened
to
these
facts
bricks
and
mortar
stone
and
timber
are
innocent
things
one
might
as
soon
dissect
a
to
find
the
lightning
as
destroy
material
substances
to
discover
what
is
hidden
in
this
house
the
unknown
being
about
his
master
business
here
will
no
more
yield
its
secret
to
four
detectives
or
an
army
of
them
than
it
did
to
one
i
do
thou
knowest
not
now
it
is
all
summed
up
in
that
he
turned
to
mannering
and
asked
a
sudden
question
why
did
you
object
to
mary
hearing
these
facts
in
what
way
should
they
distress
her
particularly
can
you
not
see
indeed
one
might
fairly
have
objected
to
your
presence
also
but
you
are
a
man
there
is
an
implied
horror
of
the
darkest
sort
for
poor
mary
in
the
suggestion
that
hardcastle
may
still
live
if
he
can
be
brought
back
to
life
then
she
would
surely
think
that
perhaps
her
husband
and
your
son
might
have
been
imagine
the
agony
of
that
i
speak
plainly
indeed
there
is
no
rational
or
sentimental
reason
why
i
should
not
for
the
truth
is
of
course
that
the
signs
of
death
were
clearly
evident
on
your
poor
boy
before
what
we
had
to
do
was
done
but
the
bare
thought
must
have
shocked
mary
we
know
emphatically
that
hardcastle
is
dead
and
we
need
not
mention
to
her
this
fantastic
theory
from
london
i
appreciate
your
consideration
said
sir
walter
and
the
clergyman
also
acknowledged
it
there
can
be
no
shadow
of
doubt
concerning
my
son
he
said
nor
is
there
any
in
the
matter
of
this
unfortunate
man
henry
lennox
went
to
prepare
for
the
journey
then
obeying
the
doctor
directions
and
treating
the
dead
man
as
though
he
were
merely
unconscious
they
carried
him
to
the
ambulance
car
it
was
an
unseemly
farce
in
mannering
opinion
and
he
only
realized
the
painful
nature
of
his
task
when
he
came
to
undertake
it
but
he
carried
it
through
in
every
particular
as
directed
conveyed
the
corpse
to
newton
after
dark
and
had
the
ambulance
bed
in
which
it
reposed
borne
to
the
saloon
carriage
when
the
night
mail
arrived
from
plymouth
between
eleven
and
twelve
he
was
able
to
regulate
the
temperature
with
hot
steam
and
kept
hot
bottles
to
the
feet
and
sides
of
the
dead
he
felt
impatient
and
resentful
he
poured
scorn
on
the
superior
authority
for
the
benefit
of
the
inspector
and
henry
lennox
who
accompanied
him
but
in
secret
he
experienced
emotions
of
undoubted
satisfaction
that
life
had
broken
from
its
customary
monotonous
round
to
furnish
him
with
an
adventure
so
unique
he
pointed
out
a
fact
to
the
policeman
before
they
had
started
you
will
observe
he
said
with
satire
that
despite
the
heat
we
are
directed
to
apply
to
this
unfortunate
man
rigor
mortis
has
set
in
whether
the
authority
in
london
regards
that
as
an
evidence
of
death
of
course
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
perhaps
not
i
may
be
behind
the
times
neither
mannering
nor
lennox
had
spared
much
thought
for
those
left
behind
them
at
chadlands
the
extraordinary
character
of
the
task
put
upon
them
sufficed
to
fill
their
minds
and
it
was
not
until
the
small
hours
when
they
sat
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
the
train
ran
steadily
through
darkness
and
storm
that
the
younger
spoke
of
his
cousin
i
hope
those
old
men
wo
bully
mary
he
said
i
meant
to
ask
you
to
give
uncle
walter
a
caution
may
not
quite
all
there
in
my
opinion
and
very
likely
now
you
out
of
the
way
he
get
round
sir
walter
about
that
infernal
room
mannering
became
interested
mean
for
an
instant
he
wants
to
try
his
luck
after
happened
you
forget
your
day
has
been
so
full
that
you
forget
what
did
happen
i
do
not
lennox
mary
begged
me
to
tackle
the
man
i
calmed
him
and
he
came
down
to
his
luncheon
he
must
have
thought
over
the
matter
since
then
and
seen
that
he
was
playing
with
death
far
from
it
future
is
mine
that
what
he
said
and
that
means
he
try
and
be
in
the
grey
room
alone
i
wish
to
heaven
you
made
this
clear
before
we
started
but
surely
we
can
trust
sir
walter
he
knows
what
this
means
even
if
that
superstitious
lunatic
does
i
do
want
to
bother
you
answered
henry
but
looking
back
none
so
sure
that
we
can
trust
my
uncle
he
been
pretty
wild
and
who
shall
blame
him
things
like
this
crashing
into
his
life
leave
him
guessing
he
very
shaken
and
has
lost
his
mental
grip
too
reality
played
him
such
ugly
tricks
that
he
may
be
tempted
to
fall
back
on
unreality
now
you
do
mean
he
let
may
go
into
that
room
i
hope
not
he
was
firm
enough
last
night
when
the
clergyman
clamored
to
do
so
in
fact
he
made
me
keep
watch
to
see
he
did
but
i
think
he
weakened
a
lot
since
hardcastle
came
to
grief
in
broad
daylight
and
i
be
there
to
do
anything
all
this
comes
too
late
answered
the
other
if
harm
has
happened
it
has
happened
we
can
only
pray
they
preserved
some
sanity
among
them
that
why
i
say
i
hope
they
not
bullying
mary
answered
lennox
of
course
she
be
dead
against
her
idea
but
she
wo
count
she
ca
control
him
if
sir
walter
goes
over
to
his
side
let
us
not
imagine
anything
so
unreasonable
we
telegraph
to
hear
if
all
well
at
the
first
moment
we
can
the
storm
sent
a
heavy
wash
of
rain
against
the
side
of
the
carriage
it
was
a
famous
tempest
that
punished
the
south
of
england
from
land
end
to
the
north
foreland
they
were
distracted
from
their
thoughts
by
the
terrific
impact
of
the
wind
wonder
we
can
stop
on
the
rails
said
mannering
this
is
a
gale
or
i
mistaken
i
thinking
of
the
chadlands
trees
answered
the
other
it
rum
how
in
the
middle
of
such
an
awful
business
as
this
the
mind
switches
off
to
trifles
does
it
on
purpose
i
suppose
to
relieve
the
strain
yes
the
trees
will
catch
it
i
expect
i
shall
hear
a
grim
tale
of
fallen
timber
from
sir
walter
by
the
time
i
get
back
if
nothing
fallen
but
timber
i
mind
answered
mannering
but
you
made
me
devilish
uneasy
now
if
anything
further
went
wrong
well
to
put
it
mildly
they
would
say
your
uncle
ought
to
have
known
a
great
deal
better
he
does
know
a
great
deal
better
it
only
that
temporarily
knocked
off
his
balance
but
i
hardly
feel
as
anxious
as
you
do
mary
against
may
and
even
if
my
uncle
were
for
him
on
a
general
vague
theory
of
something
esoteric
and
outside
nature
which
you
ca
fairly
call
unreasonable
any
more
mannering
seeing
what
happened
even
if
sir
walter
felt
tempted
to
let
him
have
his
way
i
do
believe
really
consent
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
hope
not
i
hope
not
answered
the
other
such
a
concession
would
take
a
lot
of
explanation
if
the
result
were
another
of
these
disasters
there
ought
to
be
an
official
guard
over
the
room
after
there
certainly
will
be
replied
henry
you
may
be
sure
the
police
wo
leave
it
again
till
they
satisfied
themselves
all
the
same
i
do
see
how
a
dozen
of
them
will
be
any
safer
than
one
even
if
it
some
material
and
physical
thing
that
happens
as
we
must
suppose
and
for
that
matter
if
it
really
supernatural
why
should
a
dozen
be
safer
than
one
obviously
they
would
whatever
it
is
it
can
strike
as
it
likes
and
without
being
struck
back
but
mannering
did
not
answer
these
questions
he
was
considering
a
little
book
in
his
pocket
which
he
would
hand
over
to
the
police
in
london
next
morning
poor
chap
if
he
could
have
begun
by
taking
the
problem
by
the
throat
as
he
has
written
here
but
instead
it
took
him
by
the
throat
he
took
hardcastle
notebook
from
his
pocket
and
read
again
the
last
few
pages
he
was
dreaming
of
his
theories
to
the
last
when
he
should
surely
have
been
girt
up
in
every
limb
to
face
facts
said
lennox
he
never
realized
the
horrible
danger
perusal
of
the
detective
data
had
revealed
an
interesting
fact
it
was
known
by
his
colleagues
that
he
designed
a
book
on
the
theory
and
practice
of
criminal
investigations
and
in
many
of
his
subsequently
examined
were
found
memoranda
and
jottings
doubtless
destined
to
be
worked
out
at
another
time
it
was
clear
that
he
had
for
a
few
moments
drifted
away
from
the
grey
room
in
thought
when
his
death
overtook
him
past
events
not
present
problems
were
apparently
responsible
for
the
reflections
that
occupied
his
mind
he
was
not
concentrating
on
the
material
phenomena
actually
under
his
observation
when
he
died
but
following
some
private
meditations
provoked
by
his
experiences
elimination
embraces
the
secret
of
success
he
had
written
exercise
the
full
force
of
your
intelligence
and
spare
no
pains
to
eliminate
from
every
case
all
matter
not
bearing
directly
upon
the
actual
problem
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
issue
is
direct
and
once
permit
side
issues
to
draw
their
tracks
across
it
once
admit
metaphysical
lines
of
reasoning
the
result
will
be
confusion
and
a
problem
increasing
in
complexity
at
every
stage
only
in
romances
where
a
plot
is
invented
and
then
complicated
by
deliberate
art
shall
we
find
the
truth
ultimately
permitted
to
appear
in
some
subordinate
incident
or
individual
studiously
kept
in
the
background
that
is
the
craft
of
telling
detective
stories
but
in
truth
one
needs
to
lay
hold
of
the
problem
by
the
throat
at
the
outset
deception
is
too
much
the
province
of
the
criminal
and
too
little
the
business
of
the
investigator
and
where
it
may
be
possible
to
creep
like
a
snake
into
a
case
unknown
for
what
you
truly
are
then
your
opportunities
and
chances
of
success
are
enormously
increased
it
is
however
the
exception
when
one
can
start
without
the
knowledge
of
anybody
involved
and
the
scotland
yard
of
the
future
will
pursue
its
business
under
very
different
circumstances
from
the
present
the
detective
work
should
be
made
easier
and
not
more
difficult
none
should
know
who
is
working
on
a
case
the
representatives
should
be
disguised
and
move
among
the
characters
surrounding
the
crime
as
something
other
than
they
really
are
they
will
here
hardcastle
reflections
came
to
an
end
some
previous
notes
there
were
of
superficial
accidents
in
the
grey
room
and
a
rough
ground
plan
of
it
but
nothing
more
he
had
evidently
for
the
time
being
broken
away
from
his
environment
and
was
merely
thinking
with
a
pen
on
paper
when
he
died
chapter
vii
the
fanatic
a
succession
of
incidents
that
must
have
perturbed
the
doctor
and
his
companion
in
earnest
had
followed
upon
their
departure
from
chadlands
and
mary
soon
discovered
that
she
was
faced
with
a
terrible
problem
for
one
young
woman
had
little
chance
of
winning
her
way
against
an
old
man
and
the
religious
convictions
that
another
had
impressed
upon
him
sir
walter
and
the
priest
were
now
at
one
nor
did
the
common
sense
of
a
fourth
party
to
the
argument
convince
them
at
dinner
septimus
may
declared
his
purpose
we
are
happily
free
of
any
antagonistic
and
material
influence
he
said
providence
has
willed
that
those
opposed
to
us
should
be
taken
elsewhere
and
i
am
now
able
to
do
my
duty
without
more
opposition
surely
father
you
do
not
wish
this
asked
mary
i
thought
you
but
the
elder
was
fretful
let
me
eat
my
meal
in
peace
he
answered
i
am
not
made
of
iron
and
reason
cuts
both
ways
it
was
reasonable
to
deny
may
before
these
events
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
pretend
that
the
death
of
peter
hardcastle
has
not
changed
my
opinions
to
cleave
to
the
possibility
of
a
physical
explanation
any
longer
is
mere
folly
and
obstinacy
i
believe
him
to
be
right
this
is
fearful
for
me
and
fearful
for
everybody
here
do
you
see
what
it
would
mean
if
anything
happened
to
you
may
even
supposing
there
is
a
spirit
hidden
in
the
grey
room
with
power
and
permission
to
destroy
us
why
that
being
so
are
you
any
safer
than
dear
tom
was
or
this
poor
man
because
i
am
armed
mary
and
they
were
defenseless
unhappily
youth
is
seldom
clothed
in
the
whole
armor
of
righteousness
my
dear
son
was
a
good
and
honorable
man
but
he
was
not
a
religious
man
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
incomparable
and
vital
value
of
the
practice
of
christian
faith
hardcastle
invited
his
own
doom
he
admitted
he
even
appeared
to
pride
himself
upon
a
crude
and
pagan
rationalism
it
is
not
surprising
that
such
a
man
should
be
called
away
to
learn
the
lessons
of
which
he
stood
so
gravely
in
need
i
know
that
our
dear
tom
was
bidden
to
higher
work
to
labor
in
a
higher
cause
than
here
to
purer
knowledge
of
those
things
that
matter
most
to
the
human
soul
said
mary
but
that
is
not
to
say
god
chose
to
take
him
by
a
miracle
for
what
you
believe
amounts
to
a
miracle
you
know
that
i
am
bearing
my
loss
in
the
same
spirit
as
yourself
but
granted
it
had
to
be
at
god
will
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
suppose
the
means
employed
were
outside
nature
how
can
you
pretend
they
are
inside
nature
as
we
know
it
asked
her
father
we
know
nothing
at
all
yet
and
i
implore
may
to
wait
until
we
are
at
least
assured
that
science
can
not
find
a
reason
fear
not
for
me
my
child
answered
septimus
may
you
forget
certain
details
that
have
assisted
to
decide
me
remember
that
hardcastle
had
openly
denied
and
derided
the
possibility
of
supernatural
peril
he
had
challenged
this
potent
thing
not
an
hour
before
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
it
tom
went
to
his
death
innocently
this
man
can
not
be
absolved
so
easily
in
my
case
with
my
knowledge
and
faith
the
conditions
are
very
different
and
i
oppose
an
impregnable
barrier
between
myself
and
the
secret
being
i
am
an
old
priest
and
i
go
knowing
the
nature
of
my
task
my
weapons
are
such
that
a
good
spirit
would
applaud
them
and
an
evil
spirit
be
powerless
against
them
do
you
not
see
that
the
almighty
could
never
permit
one
of
his
creatures
for
even
the
devils
also
are
his
to
defeat
his
own
minister
or
trample
on
the
name
of
christ
it
would
amount
to
that
so
armed
one
might
walk
in
safety
through
the
lowermost
hell
for
hell
can
only
believe
and
tremble
before
the
truth
mary
looked
hopelessly
at
her
father
but
he
offered
her
small
comfort
sir
walter
still
found
himself
conforming
to
the
fierce
piety
and
dogmatic
assurance
of
the
man
of
god
in
this
welter
and
upheaval
his
modest
intellect
found
only
a
foothold
here
and
his
judgment
now
firmly
inclined
to
the
confident
assertions
of
religion
he
was
himself
a
devout
and
conventional
believer
and
he
turned
to
the
support
of
faith
and
shared
with
increasing
conviction
the
opinion
of
septimus
may
as
uttered
in
a
volume
of
confident
words
he
became
blind
to
the
physical
danger
he
even
showed
a
measure
of
annoyance
at
mary
obstinate
entreaties
she
strove
to
calm
him
and
told
him
he
was
not
himself
an
assertion
that
by
his
inner
consciousness
of
its
truth
seemed
to
incense
sir
walter
he
begged
her
to
be
silent
and
declared
that
her
remarks
savored
of
irreverence
startled
and
bewildered
by
such
a
criticism
the
woman
was
indeed
silent
for
some
time
while
her
flowed
on
and
uttered
his
conviction
yet
not
all
his
intensity
and
asseverations
could
justify
such
extravagant
assertion
at
another
time
they
might
even
have
amused
mary
but
in
sight
of
the
fact
that
her
father
was
yielding
and
that
the
end
of
the
argument
would
mean
the
clergyman
in
the
grey
room
she
could
win
nothing
but
frantic
anxiety
from
the
situation
sir
walter
was
broken
he
had
lost
his
hold
on
reality
and
she
realized
that
his
unsettled
intelligence
had
gone
over
to
the
opposition
and
there
was
none
as
it
seemed
to
argue
on
her
side
septimus
may
had
acted
like
a
dangerous
drug
on
sir
walter
he
appeared
to
be
intoxicated
in
some
degree
but
only
in
mind
not
in
manner
he
argued
for
his
new
attitude
and
he
was
not
as
excited
as
the
priest
but
maintained
his
usual
level
tones
i
agreed
with
mannering
and
henry
yesterday
as
you
know
mary
he
said
and
at
my
desire
may
desisted
from
his
wish
we
see
how
mistaken
i
was
how
right
he
must
have
been
i
have
thought
it
out
this
afternoon
calmly
and
logically
these
unfortunate
young
men
have
died
without
a
reason
for
be
sure
no
explanation
of
peter
hardcastle
death
will
be
forthcoming
though
the
whole
college
of
surgeons
examines
his
corpse
then
we
must
admit
that
life
has
been
snatched
out
of
these
bodies
by
some
force
of
which
we
have
no
conception
were
it
natural
science
would
have
discovered
a
reason
for
death
but
it
could
not
because
their
lives
flowed
away
as
water
out
of
a
bottle
leaving
the
bottle
unchanged
in
every
particular
but
life
does
not
desert
its
physical
habitation
on
these
terms
it
can
not
quit
a
healthy
human
body
neither
ruined
nor
rent
you
must
be
honest
with
yourself
my
child
as
well
as
with
your
and
me
a
physical
cause
being
absolutely
ruled
out
what
remains
i
emphatically
support
may
and
my
conscience
long
in
terrible
concern
is
now
at
rest
again
and
because
it
is
at
rest
i
know
that
i
have
done
well
i
believe
that
what
dear
tom
father
desires
to
do
namely
to
spend
this
night
in
the
grey
room
is
now
within
his
province
and
entirely
proper
to
his
profession
and
i
share
his
perfect
faith
and
confidence
it
is
you
who
lack
faith
mary
continued
septimus
may
you
lack
faith
otherwise
you
would
appreciate
the
unquestionable
truth
of
what
your
father
tells
you
listen
he
continued
and
understand
something
of
what
this
means
from
a
larger
outlook
than
our
own
selfish
and
immediate
interests
much
may
come
of
my
action
for
the
faith
at
large
i
may
find
an
answer
to
those
grave
questions
concerning
the
life
beyond
and
the
whole
problem
of
spiritualism
now
convulsing
the
church
and
casting
us
into
opposing
sections
it
is
untrodden
and
mysterious
ground
but
i
am
called
upon
to
tread
it
for
my
part
i
am
never
prepared
to
flout
inquirers
if
they
approach
these
subjects
in
a
reverent
spirit
we
must
not
revile
good
men
because
they
think
differently
from
ourselves
we
must
examine
the
assertions
of
such
inquirers
as
sir
oliver
lodge
and
sir
conan
doyle
in
a
mood
of
reverence
and
sympathy
some
men
drift
away
from
the
truth
in
vital
particulars
but
not
so
far
that
they
can
not
return
if
the
road
is
made
clear
to
them
we
must
remember
that
our
conviction
of
a
double
existence
rests
on
the
revelation
of
god
through
his
son
not
on
a
mere
vague
desire
toward
a
future
life
common
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
they
suspected
and
hoped
we
know
science
may
explain
that
general
desire
if
it
pleases
it
can
not
explain
or
destroy
the
triumphant
certainty
born
of
faith
spiritualism
has
succeeded
to
the
biblical
record
of
and
i
for
my
part
of
course
prefer
what
my
bible
teaches
i
do
not
myself
find
that
the
of
modern
spiritualism
speak
with
tongues
worthy
of
much
respect
up
to
the
present
and
it
is
certain
that
rogues
abound
but
the
question
is
clamant
it
demands
to
be
discussed
by
our
spiritual
guides
and
the
fathers
of
the
church
already
they
recognize
this
fact
and
are
beginning
to
approach
it
some
priests
in
a
right
spirit
some
as
at
the
church
congress
last
month
in
a
wrong
spirit
a
wrong
spirit
may
asked
sir
walter
in
my
opinion
a
wrong
spirit
answered
the
other
there
is
much
even
in
a
meeting
of
the
church
congress
that
makes
truly
religious
men
mourn
they
laughed
when
they
should
have
learned
i
refer
to
incidents
and
criticisms
of
last
october
there
the
dean
of
manchester
who
shows
how
those
who
have
apparently
spoken
to
us
from
beyond
through
the
mouths
of
living
persons
describe
their
different
states
and
conditions
stainton
moses
gave
us
a
vision
of
heaven
such
as
an
oxford
don
and
myself
might
be
supposed
to
appreciate
raymond
describes
a
heaven
wherein
the
average
second
lieutenant
could
find
all
that
for
the
moment
he
needs
but
why
laugh
at
these
things
if
we
make
our
own
hells
shall
we
not
make
our
own
heavens
we
must
go
into
the
next
world
more
or
less
cloyed
and
clogged
with
the
emotions
and
interests
of
this
one
it
is
inevitable
we
can
not
instantly
throw
off
a
lifetime
of
interests
affections
and
desires
we
are
still
human
and
pass
onward
as
human
beings
not
as
angels
of
light
therefore
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
the
almighty
will
temper
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
nor
impose
too
harsh
and
terrible
a
transformation
upon
the
souls
of
the
righteous
departed
but
lead
one
and
all
by
gradual
stages
and
through
not
unfamiliar
conditions
to
the
heaven
of
ultimate
and
absolute
perfection
that
he
has
designed
for
his
conscious
creatures
well
spoken
said
sir
walter
but
may
had
not
finished
he
proceeded
to
the
immediate
point
shall
it
be
denied
that
devils
have
been
cast
out
in
the
name
of
god
he
asked
and
if
from
human
tenements
then
why
not
from
dwellings
made
with
human
hands
also
may
not
a
house
be
similarly
cleansed
as
well
as
a
soul
this
unknown
spirit
angel
or
fiend
or
other
sentient
being
is
permitted
to
challenge
mankind
and
draw
attention
to
its
existence
a
mystery
i
grant
but
its
maker
has
now
willed
that
some
measure
of
this
mystery
shall
be
revealed
to
us
we
are
called
to
play
our
part
in
this
spirit
existence
it
would
seem
that
it
has
endured
a
sort
of
imprisonment
in
this
particular
room
for
more
years
than
we
know
and
it
may
actually
be
the
spirit
of
some
departed
human
being
condemned
for
causes
that
humanity
has
forgotten
to
remain
within
these
walls
the
nameless
and
unknown
thing
cries
passionately
to
be
liberated
and
is
permitted
by
its
maker
to
draw
our
terrified
attention
upon
itself
by
the
exercise
of
destructive
functions
transcending
our
reason
god
then
has
willed
that
through
the
agency
of
devout
and
living
men
the
unhappy
phantom
shall
now
be
translated
and
moved
from
this
environment
for
ever
and
to
me
the
appointed
task
is
allotted
so
i
believe
as
firmly
as
i
believe
in
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
lord
is
that
clear
to
you
sir
walter
it
is
you
have
made
it
convincingly
clear
so
be
it
then
i
too
mary
am
not
dead
to
the
meaning
of
science
in
its
proper
place
we
may
take
an
illustration
of
what
i
have
told
you
from
astronomy
as
comets
enter
our
system
from
realms
of
which
we
have
no
knowledge
dazzle
us
a
little
awaken
our
speculations
and
then
depart
so
may
certain
immortal
spirits
also
be
supposed
to
act
we
entangle
them
possibly
in
our
gross
air
and
detain
them
for
centuries
or
moments
until
their
creator
purpose
in
sending
them
is
accomplished
then
he
takes
the
means
to
liberate
them
and
set
them
on
their
eternal
roads
and
to
their
eternal
tasks
once
more
the
listening
woman
almost
against
her
reason
felt
herself
beginning
to
share
these
assumptions
but
that
they
were
fantastic
unsupported
by
any
human
knowledge
and
would
presently
involve
an
experiment
full
of
awful
peril
to
the
life
of
the
man
who
uttered
them
she
also
perceived
yet
her
reasonable
caution
and
conventional
distrust
began
to
give
way
a
little
under
the
priest
magnetic
voice
his
flaming
eyes
his
positive
and
triumphant
certainty
of
truth
he
burned
with
his
inspiration
and
she
felt
herself
powerless
to
oppose
any
argument
founded
on
facts
against
the
mystic
enthusiasm
of
such
religious
faith
his
honesty
and
fervor
could
not
however
abate
mary
acute
fear
her
father
had
entirely
gone
over
to
the
side
of
the
devotee
and
she
knew
it
it
is
well
we
have
your
opportunity
he
said
for
had
the
police
arrived
out
of
their
ignorance
they
might
deny
it
to
you
yet
mary
fought
on
against
them
in
despair
she
appealed
to
masters
he
had
been
an
officer
orderly
in
his
day
and
when
he
left
the
army
and
came
to
chadlands
he
never
departed
again
he
was
an
intelligent
man
who
occupied
a
good
part
of
his
leisure
in
reading
he
set
sir
walter
and
mary
first
in
his
affections
and
that
mary
should
have
won
him
so
completely
she
always
held
to
be
a
triumph
since
abraham
masters
had
no
regard
or
admiration
for
women
ca
you
help
me
masters
she
begged
i
sure
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
this
ought
not
to
happen
the
butler
eyed
his
master
he
was
handing
coffee
but
none
took
it
by
all
means
speak
said
sir
walter
you
know
how
i
rate
your
judgment
masters
you
have
heard
may
upon
this
terrible
subject
and
should
be
convinced
as
i
am
masters
was
very
guarded
it
not
for
me
to
pass
an
opinion
sir
walter
but
the
reverend
gentleman
no
doubt
understands
such
things
only
there
the
witch
of
endor
if
i
may
mention
the
creature
she
fetched
up
more
than
she
bargained
for
and
i
remember
a
proverb
as
i
heard
in
india
from
a
hindoo
i
forgot
the
lingo
now
but
i
remember
the
sense
they
hindoos
say
that
if
you
knock
long
enough
at
a
closed
door
the
devil
will
open
it
excuse
my
mentioning
such
a
thing
but
hindoos
are
awful
wise
and
what
then
masters
i
know
not
who
may
open
the
door
of
this
mystery
but
this
i
know
that
in
the
name
of
the
most
high
god
i
can
face
whatever
opens
it
i
ai
particular
frightened
neither
your
reverence
said
masters
but
i
would
chance
it
alone
being
about
average
sinful
and
not
near
good
enough
to
tackle
that
unknown
horror
hid
up
there
i
chance
it
though
in
high
company
like
yours
and
something
it
is
masters
and
much
to
your
credit
declared
sir
walter
for
that
matter
i
would
do
the
like
indeed
i
am
willing
to
accompany
mr
may
while
septimus
may
shook
his
head
and
mary
trembled
the
butler
spoke
again
but
there
nobody
else
in
this
house
would
not
even
fred
caunter
who
does
know
the
meaning
of
fear
as
you
can
testify
sir
walter
but
he
fed
up
with
the
grey
room
if
i
may
say
so
and
so
the
housekeeper
forbes
and
so
jane
bond
not
that
they
would
desert
the
ship
but
there
others
that
be
going
to
do
so
i
may
mention
that
four
maids
and
jackson
intend
to
give
notice
ann
maine
the
second
housemaid
has
gone
her
father
fetched
her
excuse
me
mentioning
it
but
forbes
will
give
you
the
particulars
if
you
please
hysteria
declared
sir
walter
i
do
blame
them
it
is
natural
everybody
is
free
to
go
if
they
desire
to
do
so
but
tell
them
what
you
have
heard
masters
tell
them
that
no
good
christian
need
fear
to
rest
in
peace
explain
that
may
will
presently
enter
the
grey
room
in
the
name
of
god
and
bid
them
pray
on
their
knees
for
him
before
they
go
to
sleep
masters
hesitated
all
the
same
i
very
much
wish
the
reverend
gentleman
would
give
scotland
yard
a
chance
if
they
fall
then
he
can
wipe
their
eye
after
excuse
my
language
sir
walter
i
read
a
lot
about
the
spirits
being
terrible
interested
in
as
all
human
men
must
be
and
i
hear
that
running
after
often
brings
trouble
i
do
mean
to
your
life
sir
walter
but
to
your
wits
people
get
cracked
on
and
have
to
be
locked
up
i
stopped
everybody
frightening
themselves
into
at
dinner
but
you
could
see
how
it
took
and
whether
or
no
i
do
beg
may
to
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
sit
up
along
with
him
you
never
hear
of
two
people
getting
into
trouble
with
these
here
customers
and
while
he
was
going
for
this
blackguard
ghost
in
the
name
of
the
lord
i
could
keep
my
weather
eye
lifting
for
trouble
is
a
matter
for
common
sense
and
keeping
your
nerve
in
my
opinion
and
we
do
want
another
death
on
our
hands
i
suppose
there
be
half
the
mountebanks
and
photograph
men
and
newspaper
men
in
the
land
here
and
take
me
all
my
time
to
keep
from
the
house
because
if
they
could
come
in
their
scores
for
the
late
captain
poor
gentleman
what
wo
they
try
now
this
here
famous
detective
has
been
done
in
henry
deplored
the
same
thing
said
mary
and
i
answer
again
as
i
answered
then
replied
septimus
may
you
mean
well
sir
walter
and
your
butler
means
well
but
you
propose
an
act
in
direct
opposition
to
the
principle
that
inspires
me
what
do
you
expect
to
happen
asked
mary
do
you
suppose
you
will
see
something
and
that
something
will
tell
you
what
it
is
and
why
it
killed
dear
tom
that
at
any
rate
would
be
a
very
great
blessing
to
the
living
said
her
father
the
least
the
creature
could
do
in
my
humble
opinion
ventured
masters
but
septimus
may
deprecated
such
curiosity
hope
for
no
such
thing
and
do
not
dwell
upon
what
is
to
happen
until
i
am
able
to
tell
you
what
does
happen
he
answered
allow
no
human
weakness
no
desire
to
learn
the
secrets
of
another
world
to
distract
your
thoughts
i
am
only
concerned
with
what
i
know
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
is
my
duty
to
be
entered
upon
as
swiftly
as
possible
i
hear
my
call
in
the
very
voice
of
the
wind
shouting
round
the
house
but
beyond
my
duty
i
do
not
seek
whether
information
awaits
me
whether
some
manifestation
indicating
my
success
and
valuable
to
humanity
will
be
granted
i
can
not
say
i
do
not
stop
now
to
think
about
that
alone
i
do
this
thing
yet
not
alone
for
my
hand
is
in
my
hand
your
part
will
not
be
to
accompany
me
let
each
man
and
woman
be
informed
of
what
i
do
and
let
them
lift
a
petition
for
me
that
my
work
be
crowned
with
success
but
let
them
not
assume
that
i
shall
have
anything
to
impart
the
night
may
be
one
of
peace
within
though
so
stormy
without
i
may
pray
till
dawn
with
no
knowledge
how
my
prayer
prospers
or
i
may
be
called
to
face
a
being
that
no
human
eye
has
ever
seen
and
lived
these
things
are
hidden
from
us
you
are
wonderful
and
it
is
heartening
to
meet
with
such
mighty
faith
replied
sir
walter
you
have
no
fear
no
shadow
of
hesitation
or
doubt
at
the
bottom
of
your
mind
none
only
an
overmastering
desire
to
obey
the
message
that
throbs
in
my
heart
i
will
be
honest
with
you
for
i
recognize
that
many
might
doubt
whether
you
were
in
the
right
to
let
me
face
this
ordeal
but
i
am
driven
by
an
overwhelming
mandate
did
i
fear
or
feel
one
tremor
of
uncertainty
i
would
not
proceed
for
any
wavering
might
be
fatal
and
give
me
helpless
into
the
power
of
this
watchful
spirit
but
i
am
as
certain
of
my
duty
as
i
am
that
salvation
awaits
the
just
man
i
believe
that
i
shall
liberate
this
arrested
being
with
cathartic
prayer
and
cleansing
petition
to
our
common
maker
and
have
i
not
the
spirit
of
my
dead
boy
on
my
side
could
any
living
man
however
well
intentioned
watch
with
me
and
over
me
as
he
will
fear
nothing
go
to
your
rest
and
let
all
who
would
assist
me
do
so
on
their
knees
before
they
sleep
even
masters
echoed
some
of
this
fierce
and
absolute
faith
when
he
returned
to
the
servants
hall
his
eyes
blaze
he
said
he
about
the
most
steadfast
man
ever
i
saw
inside
a
pulpit
or
out
of
it
you
feel
if
that
man
went
to
the
window
and
told
the
rain
to
stop
and
the
wind
to
go
down
they
would
no
ghost
that
ever
walked
could
best
him
anyway
they
asked
me
to
talk
and
say
what
i
felt
and
i
did
but
words
are
powerless
against
such
an
iron
will
as
he
got
i
doubted
first
and
sir
walter
said
he
doubted
likewise
but
he
dead
sure
now
and
what
good
enough
for
him
is
good
enough
for
us
i
bet
caunter
or
any
man
an
even
flyer
that
he
going
to
put
the
creature
down
and
out
and
come
off
without
a
scratch
himself
i
offered
to
sit
up
with
him
so
did
sir
walter
but
he
would
hear
of
it
so
all
got
to
do
is
to
turn
in
and
say
our
prayers
that
simple
enough
for
people
and
we
ca
do
no
better
than
to
obey
orders
it
was
none
the
less
a
nervous
and
highly
strung
household
that
presently
went
to
bed
and
no
woman
slept
without
another
woman
to
keep
her
company
sir
walter
found
himself
worn
out
in
mind
and
body
mary
made
him
take
his
bromide
and
he
slept
without
a
dream
despite
the
din
of
the
great
and
the
distant
solemn
crash
of
more
than
one
great
tree
thrown
upon
the
lap
of
mother
earth
at
last
before
he
retired
however
something
in
the
nature
of
a
procession
had
escorted
the
priest
to
his
ordeal
may
donned
biretta
surplice
and
stole
for
as
he
explained
he
was
to
hold
a
religious
service
as
sacred
and
significant
as
any
other
rite
lord
send
him
no
congregation
then
thought
masters
but
with
sir
walter
and
mary
he
followed
the
ministrant
and
left
him
at
the
open
door
of
the
grey
room
the
electric
light
shone
steadily
but
the
storm
seemed
to
beat
its
fists
at
the
windows
and
the
leaded
panes
shook
and
chattered
with
no
bell
and
candle
but
his
bible
alone
septimus
may
entered
the
room
having
first
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
before
him
then
he
turned
and
bade
to
all
be
of
good
faith
were
the
last
words
he
spoke
to
them
having
done
so
he
shut
the
door
and
they
heard
his
voice
immediately
uplifted
in
prayer
they
waited
a
little
and
the
sound
roiled
steadily
on
sir
walter
then
bade
masters
extinguish
all
the
lights
and
send
the
household
to
bed
though
the
time
was
not
more
than
ten
as
for
masters
the
glamour
and
appeal
of
those
strenuous
words
at
the
had
now
passed
and
presently
as
he
prepared
to
retire
he
found
himself
far
less
confident
and
assured
than
his
recent
words
had
implied
he
sank
slowly
from
hope
to
fear
even
pictured
the
worse
and
asked
himself
what
would
follow
if
the
worst
happened
he
believed
that
it
might
mean
serious
disaster
for
sir
walter
if
another
life
were
sacrificed
to
this
unknown
peril
and
it
transpired
that
his
master
had
sanctioned
what
would
amount
to
suicide
in
the
eyes
of
reason
then
he
began
to
fear
that
grave
trouble
must
result
already
the
burning
words
of
septimus
may
began
to
cool
and
sound
unreal
and
masters
suspected
that
if
they
were
repeated
in
other
ears
which
had
not
heard
him
utter
them
or
seen
the
fervor
of
religious
earnestness
and
reverence
in
which
they
had
been
spoken
this
feverish
business
of
exorcising
a
ghost
in
the
twentieth
century
might
only
awake
derision
and
receive
neither
credence
nor
respect
his
entire
concern
was
for
sir
walter
not
may
he
could
not
sleep
lighted
a
pipe
considered
whether
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
anything
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
take
certain
steps
yet
hesitated
from
no
fear
to
himself
but
doubt
whether
action
might
not
endanger
another
mary
did
not
sleep
either
and
she
suffered
more
for
she
had
never
approved
and
now
she
blamed
herself
not
a
little
for
her
weak
opposition
a
thousand
arguments
occurred
to
her
while
she
lay
awake
then
for
a
time
she
forgot
present
tribulations
and
her
own
grief
overwhelmed
her
as
it
was
wont
to
do
by
night
for
while
the
events
that
had
so
swiftly
followed
each
other
since
her
husband
death
banished
him
now
and
again
save
from
her
subconscious
mind
when
alone
he
was
swift
to
return
and
her
sorrow
made
many
a
night
sleepless
she
was
herself
ill
but
did
not
know
it
the
reaction
had
yet
to
come
and
could
not
be
long
delayed
for
her
nervous
energy
was
worn
out
now
she
wept
and
lived
days
with
the
dead
then
the
present
returned
to
her
mind
and
she
fretted
and
prayed
for
septimus
may
and
for
daylight
she
wondered
why
stormy
nights
were
always
the
longest
she
heard
a
thousand
unfamiliar
sounds
and
presently
leaped
from
her
bed
put
on
a
and
crept
out
into
the
house
to
know
that
all
was
well
with
the
watcher
would
hearten
her
but
then
her
feet
dragged
before
she
had
left
the
threshold
of
her
own
room
and
she
stood
still
and
shuddered
a
little
for
how
if
all
were
not
well
how
if
his
voice
no
longer
sounded
she
hesitated
to
make
the
experiment
and
balanced
the
relief
of
reassurance
against
the
horror
of
silence
she
remembered
a
storm
at
sea
when
through
a
long
night
not
lacking
danger
to
a
laboring
steamer
with
weak
engines
she
had
lain
awake
and
felt
her
heart
warm
again
when
the
watch
shouted
the
hour
she
set
out
then
determined
to
know
if
all
prospered
with
her
nor
would
she
give
ear
to
misgiving
or
ask
herself
what
she
would
do
if
no
voice
were
steadily
uplifted
in
the
grey
room
the
great
wind
seemed
to
play
upon
chadlands
like
a
harp
it
roared
and
reverberated
now
stilled
a
moment
for
another
leap
now
died
away
against
the
house
yet
still
sounded
with
a
steady
shout
in
the
neighbor
trees
at
the
casements
it
tugged
and
rattled
against
them
it
flung
the
rain
fiercely
every
bay
and
passage
of
the
interior
uttered
its
own
voice
and
overhead
was
creaking
of
old
timbers
rattling
of
old
slates
and
rustling
of
mortar
fragments
dislodged
by
sudden
vibrations
mary
proceeded
on
her
way
and
then
to
her
astonishment
heard
a
footfall
and
nearly
ran
into
an
invisible
figure
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
grey
room
man
and
woman
startled
each
other
but
neither
exclaimed
and
may
spoke
who
is
it
she
asked
and
masters
answered
oh
my
gracious
terrible
sorry
if
i
did
think
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
masters
much
the
same
as
you
i
expect
i
thought
just
to
creep
along
and
see
if
the
reverend
gentleman
was
all
right
and
he
is
the
burning
you
can
see
it
under
the
door
and
he
praying
away
steady
as
a
machine
i
doubt
he
keeping
the
evil
creature
at
arm
length
and
i
a
tidy
lot
more
hopeful
than
what
i
was
an
hour
ago
the
thing
ai
strong
enough
to
touch
a
man
praying
to
god
like
what
he
can
but
if
prayers
keep
it
harmless
then
it
got
ears
and
it
alive
can
you
believe
that
masters
she
whispered
got
to
if
it
was
just
a
natural
horror
beyond
the
reach
of
prayer
it
would
have
knocked
his
reverence
out
long
before
now
like
other
people
it
settled
the
police
officer
in
under
an
hour
and
may
been
up
against
it
for
three
nearly
four
hours
so
far
bolt
it
yet
i
should
wonder
like
a
ferret
bolts
a
rat
you
really
feel
more
hopeful
yes
i
do
and
if
he
can
fire
the
creature
and
signal
clear
for
chadlands
it
will
calm
everybody
and
be
a
proper
feather
in
his
cap
and
he
did
ought
to
be
made
a
bishop
at
the
least
not
that
scotland
yard
men
will
believe
a
word
of
it
all
the
same
ghosts
are
bang
out
of
their
line
and
i
never
met
even
a
common
constable
that
believed
in
except
bob
parrett
and
he
had
bats
in
the
belfry
poor
chap
no
they
reckon
it
somebody
in
the
house
i
expect
who
wanted
to
kill
t
others
but
ai
got
no
quarrel
with
may
and
you
be
wise
to
get
back
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
else
you
catch
a
cold
i
look
round
again
in
an
hour
or
to
if
i
go
to
sleep
my
self
they
parted
while
the
storm
still
ran
high
and
through
the
empty
corridor
when
it
was
lulled
a
voice
rolled
steadily
on
from
the
grey
boom
when
it
suddenly
ceased
an
hour
before
dawn
the
storm
had
already
begun
to
sink
and
through
a
rack
of
flying
and
breaking
cloud
the
hunter
wheeled
westerly
to
his
setting
chapter
viii
the
labors
of
the
four
despite
the
storm
sir
walter
slept
through
the
night
and
did
not
waken
until
his
man
drew
the
blinds
upon
a
dawn
sky
so
clear
that
it
seemed
washed
of
its
blue
he
had
directed
to
be
wakened
at
six
what
of
mr
may
he
asked
masters
wants
to
know
if
we
shall
call
him
sir
walter
not
if
he
has
returned
to
his
room
but
immediately
if
still
in
the
grey
room
he
not
in
his
own
room
sir
then
seek
him
at
once
the
valet
hesitated
please
sir
walter
there
none
much
cares
to
open
the
door
he
heard
his
daughter
voice
outside
at
the
same
moment
may
has
not
left
the
grey
room
father
i
be
with
you
in
a
moment
he
answered
then
he
rose
dressed
partially
and
joined
her
she
was
full
of
active
fear
all
went
well
at
two
she
said
for
i
crept
out
to
listen
so
did
masters
may
voice
sounded
clear
and
steady
they
found
the
butler
at
the
door
of
the
grey
room
he
was
pale
and
mopping
his
forehead
i
called
to
him
but
it
as
silent
as
the
grave
in
there
he
said
it
all
up
with
the
gentleman
i
know
it
he
may
not
be
there
he
may
have
gone
out
answered
sir
walter
then
he
opened
the
door
widely
and
entered
the
electric
light
still
shone
and
killed
the
pallid
white
stare
of
the
morning
upon
a
little
table
under
it
they
observed
septimus
may
bible
open
at
an
epistle
of
paul
but
the
priest
himself
was
on
the
floor
some
little
distance
away
he
lay
in
a
huddled
heap
of
his
vestments
he
had
fallen
upon
his
right
side
apparently
and
though
the
surplice
and
cassock
which
he
had
worn
were
disarranged
he
appeared
peaceful
enough
with
his
cheek
on
a
foot
stool
as
though
disposed
deliberately
upon
the
ground
to
sleep
his
biretta
was
still
upon
his
head
his
eyes
were
open
and
the
fret
and
passion
manifested
by
his
face
in
life
had
entirely
left
it
he
looked
many
years
younger
and
no
emotion
of
any
kind
marked
his
placid
countenance
but
he
was
dead
his
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
and
his
extremities
were
already
cold
the
room
appeared
unchanged
in
every
particular
as
in
the
previous
cases
death
had
come
by
stealth
yet
robbed
as
far
as
the
living
could
judge
of
all
terror
for
its
victim
masters
called
caunter
and
sir
walter
valet
who
stood
at
the
door
the
latter
declined
to
enter
or
touch
the
dead
but
caunter
obeyed
and
together
the
two
men
lifted
may
and
carried
him
to
his
own
room
in
a
moment
it
seemed
that
the
house
knew
what
had
happened
a
scene
of
panic
and
hysteria
followed
below
stairs
and
without
jane
bond
description
of
it
mary
knew
the
people
were
running
out
of
the
house
as
from
a
plague
she
left
her
father
with
masters
and
strove
to
calm
the
frightened
domestics
she
spoke
well
and
explained
that
the
event
horrible
though
it
was
yet
proved
that
no
cause
for
their
alarm
any
longer
existed
if
it
had
been
a
wicked
spirit
we
do
not
understand
it
would
have
had
no
power
over
may
who
was
a
saint
of
god
she
said
be
at
peace
restrain
yourselves
and
fear
nothing
now
there
is
no
ghost
here
had
it
been
a
demon
or
any
such
thing
it
must
have
been
conscious
and
therefore
powerless
against
may
this
proves
that
there
is
some
fearful
natural
danger
which
we
have
not
yet
discovered
hidden
in
the
room
but
no
harm
can
happen
to
anybody
if
they
do
not
go
into
the
room
the
police
are
coming
from
scotland
yard
in
an
hour
or
two
and
you
may
feel
as
sure
as
i
do
and
sir
walter
does
that
they
will
find
out
the
truth
whatever
it
is
you
must
none
of
you
think
of
leaving
before
they
come
if
you
do
they
will
only
send
for
you
again
please
prepare
your
breakfast
and
be
reasonable
sir
walter
is
terribly
upset
and
it
would
be
a
base
thing
if
any
of
you
were
to
desert
him
at
a
moment
like
this
they
grew
steadier
before
her
and
forbes
the
housekeeper
who
believed
what
mary
had
said
added
her
voice
then
sir
walter
daughter
returned
to
her
father
who
was
with
masters
in
the
study
a
man
had
already
started
for
a
doctor
but
with
mannering
away
there
was
none
nearer
than
neon
abbot
mary
called
on
masters
to
assert
his
authority
and
reassure
the
household
as
she
had
done
she
told
him
her
argument
and
he
accepted
it
as
a
revelation
thank
god
you
could
keep
your
senses
and
see
that
tell
the
master
the
same
and
make
him
drink
a
drop
of
spirits
and
get
into
his
clothes
he
shook
cruel
he
had
already
brought
the
brandy
which
was
his
panacea
for
all
ills
and
now
left
mary
and
her
father
together
she
found
him
collapsed
and
forgot
the
cause
for
a
few
moments
in
her
present
concern
for
him
indeed
she
always
thought
and
often
said
afterwards
that
but
for
the
minor
needs
for
action
that
intervened
in
this
series
of
terrible
moments
she
must
herself
have
gone
out
of
her
mind
but
something
always
happened
as
in
this
case
to
demand
her
full
attention
and
so
arrest
and
deflect
the
strain
almost
at
the
moment
of
its
impact
she
found
that
the
ideas
she
had
just
employed
to
pacify
the
hall
were
also
in
her
father
thoughts
from
them
however
he
won
no
consolation
though
he
stood
convinced
but
the
fact
that
septimus
may
should
have
failed
and
paid
for
his
failure
with
his
life
now
assumed
its
true
significance
for
sir
walter
he
was
prostrate
and
desperate
in
such
a
condition
one
is
not
master
of
oneself
and
may
say
and
do
anything
the
old
man
armor
was
off
and
in
the
course
of
his
next
few
speeches
by
a
selfish
forgetfulness
that
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
condemn
in
another
he
revealed
a
thing
that
was
destined
to
cause
the
young
widow
bitter
and
needless
pain
first
however
he
pointed
out
what
she
already
grasped
and
made
clear
to
others
this
upsets
all
may
theories
and
gives
the
lie
to
me
as
well
why
did
i
believe
him
why
did
i
let
him
convince
me
against
my
better
judgment
do
not
fret
about
that
now
you
might
say
told
you
so
but
you
will
not
do
that
nevertheless
you
were
right
to
seek
to
stop
this
unfortunate
man
last
night
and
he
was
terribly
mistaken
no
being
from
another
world
had
anything
to
do
with
his
death
if
we
granted
that
there
is
an
end
of
religious
faith
we
can
be
sure
of
it
father
evil
spirits
would
have
had
no
power
over
may
if
there
is
a
just
god
in
heaven
then
it
is
something
else
if
not
a
spirit
then
a
living
man
a
human
devil
and
the
police
will
discover
him
in
this
house
one
we
have
known
and
trusted
for
all
are
known
and
trusted
they
will
blame
me
with
good
reason
for
sacrificing
another
life
the
irony
of
fate
that
i
of
all
men
one
so
much
alive
to
the
meaning
of
mercy
that
i
out
of
superstitious
folly
but
how
will
it
look
in
the
eyes
of
justice
black
black
i
am
well
prepared
to
suffer
what
i
have
deserved
mary
nothing
that
man
can
do
to
me
equals
the
shame
and
dismay
i
feel
when
i
consider
what
i
have
done
to
myself
you
must
not
talk
so
it
is
unworthy
of
you
you
know
it
father
while
you
speak
nobody
has
a
right
to
question
you
or
your
opinions
many
would
have
been
convinced
by
may
last
night
they
may
still
think
that
he
was
right
and
that
far
from
receiving
evil
treatment
he
was
blessed
by
being
taken
away
into
the
next
world
without
pain
or
shock
we
must
feel
for
him
as
we
try
to
feel
for
dear
tom
and
i
do
not
mean
that
i
am
sorry
for
him
i
am
only
sorry
for
us
because
of
the
difficulty
of
explaining
yet
to
tell
the
truth
will
not
be
difficult
they
must
do
the
best
they
can
it
does
matter
as
much
as
you
think
indeed
how
should
they
blame
you
at
all
until
they
themselves
find
out
the
truth
they
will
they
must
they
will
discover
the
reason
they
will
hunt
down
the
murderer
and
they
will
inevitably
attach
utmost
blame
to
me
for
listening
to
a
man
possessed
may
was
possessed
i
tell
you
he
was
exceedingly
convincing
when
i
listened
to
him
he
shook
me
too
i
should
have
supported
you
instead
of
going
over
to
him
he
knows
the
truth
now
he
is
with
tom
now
we
must
remember
that
we
know
they
are
happy
and
that
makes
the
opinion
of
living
people
matter
very
little
then
out
of
his
weakness
he
smote
her
and
thrust
upon
her
some
hours
of
agony
very
horrible
in
their
nature
which
there
was
no
good
reason
that
mary
should
have
suffered
who
is
alive
and
who
is
dead
he
asked
we
do
even
know
that
the
police
demanded
to
make
their
own
inquiries
and
peter
hardcastle
may
at
this
moment
be
a
living
and
breathing
man
if
they
are
right
she
stared
at
him
and
feared
for
his
reason
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
they
were
not
prepared
to
grant
that
he
was
dead
henry
and
mannering
took
him
up
on
that
assumption
he
may
have
been
restored
to
animation
and
his
vital
forces
recovered
why
not
there
was
nothing
visible
to
indicate
dissolution
we
have
heard
of
trances
catalepsies
which
simulate
death
so
closely
that
even
physicians
are
deceived
have
not
men
been
buried
alive
tom
father
at
this
moment
might
be
restored
to
life
if
we
only
knew
how
to
act
then
she
said
with
horrified
eyes
and
stopped
he
saw
what
he
had
done
god
forgive
me
no
no
not
that
mary
it
all
madness
and
moonshine
this
is
delirium
it
will
kill
me
do
think
i
believe
them
any
more
than
mannering
did
or
henry
did
henry
has
seen
much
death
he
could
not
have
been
deceived
tom
was
dead
and
your
heart
told
you
he
was
dead
one
can
not
truly
make
any
mistake
in
the
presence
of
death
i
know
that
mary
was
marvellously
restrained
despite
the
fact
that
she
had
received
this
appalling
blow
and
vividly
suffered
all
that
it
implied
i
will
try
to
put
it
out
of
my
mind
father
she
said
quietly
but
if
hardcastle
is
alive
i
shall
go
mad
he
is
not
mannering
was
positive
nevertheless
he
may
be
and
if
he
is
then
may
probably
is
grotesque
horrible
worse
than
death
even
keep
your
mind
away
from
it
my
darling
for
the
love
of
god
who
knows
what
we
can
suffer
till
we
are
called
to
find
out
no
i
shall
not
go
mad
but
i
must
know
i
can
not
eat
or
sleep
until
i
know
i
shall
not
live
long
if
they
do
tell
me
quickly
her
father
trembled
and
grew
very
white
this
is
the
worst
of
all
he
said
these
things
will
leave
a
burning
brand
i
am
ruined
by
them
and
my
life
thrown
down
i
that
thought
i
was
strong
prove
so
weak
that
i
can
forget
my
own
daughter
and
out
of
cowardly
misery
speak
of
a
thing
she
should
never
have
known
you
have
your
revenge
mary
for
i
shall
go
a
broken
man
from
this
hour
nothing
can
ever
be
the
same
again
my
is
gone
i
could
have
endured
everything
else
the
things
that
i
dreaded
all
i
could
have
suffered
and
survived
but
to
have
forgotten
and
stabbed
you
do
do
come
we
have
got
each
other
father
we
have
still
got
each
other
the
dead
understand
everything
who
else
matters
go
to
your
room
and
let
your
dear
mind
rest
i
am
not
suffering
we
can
not
alter
the
past
and
who
would
wish
it
if
they
believe
in
eternal
life
i
would
not
call
tom
back
if
i
had
the
power
to
do
so
be
sure
of
that
she
spoke
comfortable
words
to
him
and
supported
him
to
his
room
she
knew
the
police
would
soon
arrive
and
though
they
could
not
report
concerning
the
life
or
death
of
peter
hardcastle
she
doubted
not
that
definite
information
relating
to
him
must
come
to
chadlands
quickly
upon
that
another
life
might
hang
yet
when
the
medical
man
arrived
from
newton
he
could
only
say
that
septimus
may
was
dead
he
was
a
friend
of
mannering
and
knew
the
london
opinion
that
this
form
of
apparent
death
might
in
reality
conceal
latent
possibilities
of
resuscitation
but
he
spoke
with
absolute
certainty
he
was
old
and
had
nearly
fifty
years
of
professional
experience
behind
him
the
man
is
dead
or
i
never
saw
death
he
declared
by
a
hundred
independent
evidences
we
can
be
positive
stains
have
already
appeared
and
were
they
ever
known
on
a
living
body
of
the
others
who
died
in
this
room
i
know
nothing
personally
but
here
is
death
and
in
hours
the
fact
will
be
plain
to
the
perception
of
an
idiot
what
has
happened
is
this
the
london
police
have
heard
of
a
famous
recent
german
case
mentioned
in
medizinische
wochenschraft
an
astonishing
thing
a
woman
who
had
taken
morphine
and
barbital
was
found
apparently
dead
after
a
night
exposure
in
some
lonely
spot
there
were
no
reflexes
no
pulse
no
respiration
or
yet
she
was
alive
existing
without
oxygen
an
impossibility
as
we
had
always
supposed
seeing
no
actual
evidence
of
death
the
physicians
injected
camphor
and
caffein
and
took
other
restorative
steps
with
the
result
that
in
an
hour
the
woman
breathed
again
hours
later
she
was
conscious
and
able
to
speak
it
is
assumed
that
the
poison
and
the
cold
night
air
together
had
paralyzed
her
vasomotor
nerves
and
reduced
her
body
to
a
state
akin
to
hibernation
wherein
physical
needs
are
at
their
minimum
that
case
has
doubtless
awakened
these
suspicions
and
having
regard
to
them
we
will
keep
the
poor
gentleman
in
a
warm
room
and
proceed
with
the
classical
means
for
restoring
respiration
the
doctor
was
thus
engaged
when
four
men
reached
chadlands
after
their
nightly
journey
they
were
detective
officers
of
wide
reputation
and
their
chief
a
man
with
a
round
amiable
face
and
impersonal
manner
listened
to
the
events
that
had
followed
upon
peter
arrival
and
departure
sir
walter
himself
narrated
the
incidents
and
perceiving
his
excitation
inspector
frith
assumed
the
gentlest
and
most
forbearing
attitude
that
he
knew
the
police
had
come
in
a
fighting
humor
they
arrived
without
any
preconceived
ideas
or
plan
of
action
but
they
were
in
bitter
earnest
and
knew
that
a
great
body
of
public
opinion
lay
behind
them
that
hardcastle
who
had
won
such
credit
for
his
department
and
earned
the
applause
of
two
continents
should
have
thus
been
lost
in
a
manner
so
mean
and
futile
exasperated
not
only
his
personal
colleagues
but
the
larger
public
interested
in
his
picturesque
successes
and
achievements
the
new
arrivals
felt
little
doubt
that
their
colleague
was
indeed
dead
nor
when
they
heard
of
the
last
catastrophe
and
presently
stood
by
septimus
may
could
they
feel
the
most
shadowy
suspicion
that
life
might
be
restored
to
him
sir
walter
found
his
nerve
steadied
on
the
arrival
of
these
men
indeed
by
comparison
with
other
trials
the
ordeal
before
him
now
seemed
of
no
complexity
he
gave
a
clear
account
of
events
admitted
his
great
error
and
answered
all
questions
without
any
further
confusion
of
mind
i
am
not
concerned
to
justify
my
permission
in
the
matter
of
may
he
concluded
i
deeply
deplore
it
and
bitterly
lament
the
result
but
my
reasons
for
granting
him
leave
to
do
what
he
desired
i
am
prepared
to
justify
when
the
time
comes
others
also
heard
him
speak
and
though
he
did
not
convince
my
daughter
whose
intellect
is
keener
than
my
own
i
honestly
believed
him
with
all
my
heart
it
seemed
to
me
that
only
so
could
any
reasonable
explanation
be
reached
moreover
you
have
to
consider
his
own
triumphant
conviction
and
power
of
argument
rightly
or
wrongly
he
made
me
feel
that
he
was
not
mistaken
indeed
made
me
share
his
resolute
convictions
these
things
i
am
prepared
to
explain
if
need
be
but
that
will
not
matter
to
you
personally
i
am
now
only
too
sure
that
both
septimus
may
and
i
were
mistaken
i
realize
that
there
must
exist
some
physical
causes
for
these
terrible
things
that
they
are
of
human
origin
and
i
hope
devoutly
that
you
will
be
permitted
by
providence
to
discover
them
and
those
responsible
for
them
but
the
peril
is
evidently
still
acute
the
danger
remains
and
i
need
not
ask
you
to
recognize
it
inspector
frith
answered
him
and
proved
more
human
than
sir
walter
expected
he
was
an
educated
man
of
high
standing
in
his
business
we
waste
no
time
he
said
perhaps
it
is
as
well
you
are
convinced
sir
walter
that
these
things
have
happened
inside
natural
laws
and
do
depend
on
beings
in
some
unknown
fourth
dimension
that
is
your
affair
and
i
am
very
sure
as
you
say
that
you
can
give
good
reasons
for
what
you
did
at
a
future
inquiry
though
the
results
are
so
shocking
poor
peter
was
taken
back
to
london
last
night
you
tell
us
according
to
directions
if
he
in
the
same
case
as
this
unfortunate
gentleman
then
there
not
much
doubt
about
his
being
dead
we
must
begin
at
the
beginning
though
for
us
naturally
operations
and
their
failure
are
the
most
interesting
facts
to
be
dealt
with
you
have
told
us
everything
that
happened
to
him
but
we
have
not
heard
who
found
him
my
nephew
henry
lennox
he
found
captain
may
too
he
did
he
was
the
last
to
see
him
alive
and
the
first
to
see
him
afterwards
is
he
here
he
will
be
here
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
travelled
to
london
last
night
with
the
body
of
mr
hardcastle
why
the
doctor
mannering
wished
him
to
do
so
he
desired
to
have
a
companion
have
you
anything
further
that
you
would
care
to
tell
us
only
this
that
i
think
hardcastle
with
whom
i
had
a
long
conversation
on
his
arrival
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
was
not
in
the
grey
room
we
must
look
for
an
explanation
i
believe
he
regarded
his
visit
to
the
room
itself
as
a
comparatively
unimportant
part
of
the
case
he
was
really
more
interested
in
the
life
of
my
and
his
relations
with
other
people
i
think
he
regarded
may
death
as
a
matter
which
had
been
determined
outside
the
grey
room
but
if
i
may
presume
to
advise
you
this
view
of
his
is
surely
proved
mistaken
in
the
light
of
his
own
destruction
and
what
has
happened
since
it
is
certain
now
that
the
cause
of
danger
lies
actually
in
the
room
itself
and
equally
certain
that
what
killed
my
also
killed
hardcastle
and
last
night
killed
the
reverend
septimus
may
on
the
fact
of
it
yes
admitted
frith
i
think
after
we
have
considered
the
situation
now
developed
and
visited
the
grey
room
we
shall
agree
that
there
at
any
rate
we
may
begin
the
work
that
has
brought
us
you
understand
we
rule
out
the
possibility
of
any
supernatural
event
as
hardcastle
of
course
did
while
he
very
properly
centred
on
the
history
of
captain
may
and
from
his
point
of
view
did
not
expect
to
find
the
accident
of
the
captain
death
in
this
particular
place
would
prove
important
we
shall
now
assume
otherwise
and
give
the
room
or
somebody
with
access
to
it
the
credit
for
this
destruction
of
human
life
we
shall
fasten
on
the
room
therefore
our
inquiry
is
fairly
simple
at
the
outset
simpler
than
poor
hardcastle
it
will
lie
along
one
of
two
channels
and
it
depends
entirely
upon
which
channel
we
have
to
proceed
whether
the
matter
is
going
to
take
much
time
and
possibly
fail
of
explanation
at
the
end
or
but
a
short
time
and
be
swiftly
cleared
up
i
hope
the
latter
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
can
explain
that
remark
answered
sir
walter
but
frith
was
not
prepared
immediately
to
do
so
fully
when
the
time
comes
sir
walter
but
for
the
moment
no
not
even
to
you
you
will
understand
that
our
work
must
be
entirely
secret
and
the
lines
on
which
we
proceed
known
only
to
ourselves
that
is
reasonable
for
you
can
not
tell
yet
whether
i
who
speak
to
you
may
not
be
responsible
for
everything
at
least
command
me
i
only
hope
to
heaven
you
are
not
going
to
discover
a
great
crime
i
share
your
hope
that
is
why
i
speak
of
two
channels
for
inquiry
answered
the
detective
needless
to
say
we
four
men
shall
discuss
the
new
light
thrown
upon
the
situation
very
fully
at
present
the
majority
of
us
are
inclined
to
believe
there
is
no
crime
and
the
death
of
may
does
not
to
my
mind
increase
the
likelihood
of
such
a
thing
indeed
it
supports
me
i
should
judge
in
my
present
opinion
what
that
is
will
appear
without
much
delay
we
get
to
our
quarters
now
and
ask
to
see
the
grey
room
later
on
may
i
inquire
concerning
hardcastle
i
hope
he
had
no
wife
or
family
to
mourn
him
he
was
a
bachelor
and
lived
with
his
mother
who
keeps
a
shop
the
intention
is
to
examine
his
body
this
morning
and
submit
it
to
certain
conclusive
tests
nobody
expects
much
from
them
but
they
not
going
to
lose
half
a
chance
he
was
a
great
man
you
will
hear
at
once
from
london
if
anything
transpires
to
help
you
we
shall
hear
by
noon
at
latest
sir
walter
left
them
then
and
masters
took
the
four
to
their
accommodation
their
rooms
were
situated
together
in
the
corridor
as
near
the
east
end
of
it
as
possible
but
the
four
were
not
yet
of
one
mind
and
when
they
met
presently
and
walked
together
in
the
garden
for
an
hour
it
appeared
that
while
two
of
them
agreed
with
inspector
frith
under
whom
all
acted
the
fourth
held
to
a
contrary
view
and
desired
to
take
the
second
of
the
two
channels
his
chief
had
mentioned
thus
three
men
believed
some
extraordinary
concatenation
of
circumstances
probably
mechanical
in
operation
was
responsible
for
all
that
had
happened
in
the
grey
room
but
the
fourth
a
man
older
than
frith
and
in
some
sort
his
rival
for
many
years
held
to
it
that
the
reason
of
these
things
must
be
sought
in
an
active
and
conscious
agency
he
trusted
in
a
living
cause
but
felt
confident
that
it
was
not
a
sane
one
he
had
known
a
case
when
a
madman
unsuspected
of
madness
had
operated
with
extraordinary
skill
to
destroy
innocent
persons
and
escape
detection
and
already
he
was
disposed
to
believe
that
among
the
household
of
chadlands
might
hide
such
an
insane
criminal
on
a
similar
plane
it
was
in
his
personal
experience
that
persons
possessed
with
a
desire
to
do
something
out
of
the
common
had
often
planned
and
perpetrated
apparent
physical
phenomena
and
created
an
appearance
of
supernatural
visitations
only
exposed
after
great
difficulty
by
professional
research
along
such
lines
therefore
this
man
was
prepared
to
operate
and
he
believed
it
might
be
possible
that
a
maniac
in
possession
of
some
physical
secret
would
be
found
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
manor
house
he
did
not
however
elaborate
this
opinion
but
kept
it
to
himself
indeed
the
human
element
of
jealousy
so
often
responsible
for
the
frustration
of
the
worthiest
human
ambitions
was
not
absent
from
the
minds
of
the
four
now
concerned
with
this
problem
each
desired
to
solve
it
and
while
no
rivalry
existed
among
them
save
in
the
case
of
the
two
older
men
it
was
certain
that
the
eldest
of
the
four
would
not
lose
his
hold
on
his
own
theory
or
be
at
very
vital
pains
to
stultify
it
all
however
were
fully
conscious
of
the
danger
before
them
and
frith
from
the
first
directed
that
none
was
to
work
alone
either
in
the
grey
room
or
elsewhere
at
noon
a
telegram
arrived
for
frith
from
scotland
yard
it
recorded
the
fact
that
peter
hardcastle
was
dead
and
that
examination
had
revealed
no
cause
for
his
end
the
news
reached
sir
walter
at
once
and
if
ever
he
rejoiced
in
the
death
of
a
it
was
upon
this
occasion
it
meant
unspeakable
relief
both
for
him
and
his
daughter
the
detectives
began
their
operations
after
a
midday
meal
and
having
first
carefully
studied
the
grey
room
in
every
visible
particular
they
emptied
it
of
its
contents
and
placed
the
pictures
furniture
and
statuette
outside
in
the
corridor
they
asked
for
no
assistance
and
desired
that
none
should
visit
the
scene
of
their
labors
the
apartment
empty
to
the
walls
they
examined
minutely
with
the
help
of
ladders
they
investigated
the
outer
walls
on
the
east
and
south
side
and
they
probed
the
chimney
from
above
and
below
they
searched
the
adjoining
room
mary
old
nursery
to
satisfy
themselves
that
no
communication
existed
and
they
drove
an
iron
rod
through
the
walls
in
various
directions
only
to
prove
they
were
of
solid
stone
eighteen
inches
thick
within
and
two
feet
thick
without
there
was
no
apartment
on
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
it
completed
the
eastern
angle
of
the
house
front
and
behind
it
inside
the
corridor
terminated
at
an
eastern
window
parallel
with
the
grey
room
oriel
but
flat
and
undecorated
a
modern
window
inserted
by
sir
walter
grandfather
to
lighten
a
dark
corner
not
a
foot
of
the
walls
they
left
untested
and
they
examined
and
removed
a
portion
of
the
paper
upon
them
also
then
taking
up
the
carpet
they
broke
into
the
flooring
and
skirting
boards
but
discovered
no
indication
that
the
grime
and
dust
of
centuries
had
ever
been
disturbed
the
desiccated
mummy
of
a
rat
alone
rewarded
their
scrutiny
it
lay
between
great
timbers
under
the
planking
beams
that
supported
the
elaborate
stucco
roof
of
a
below
to
the
ceiling
of
the
grey
room
they
next
turned
their
attention
fastened
an
electric
wire
to
the
nearest
point
and
through
a
in
the
roof
of
the
passage
investigated
the
empty
space
between
the
ceiling
and
the
roof
not
an
inch
of
the
massive
oaken
struts
above
did
they
fail
to
scrutinize
and
they
made
experiments
with
smoke
and
water
to
learn
if
at
any
point
so
much
as
a
existed
in
the
face
of
the
stucco
but
it
was
solid
and
spread
evenly
to
a
considerable
depth
they
studied
it
then
from
inside
the
room
to
discover
nothing
but
the
beautifully
modeled
surface
encrusted
with
successive
layers
of
whitewash
the
workmanship
belonged
to
a
time
when
men
knew
not
to
scamp
their
labors
and
art
and
craft
went
hand
in
hand
such
enthusiasms
perished
with
the
improvement
of
education
they
died
with
the
guilds
and
the
unions
are
not
concerned
to
revive
them
the
detectives
had
finished
this
examination
when
at
an
hour
in
the
late
afternoon
henry
lennox
and
mannering
returned
the
authorities
had
been
informed
of
the
death
of
septimus
may
and
desired
that
no
more
than
the
ordinary
formalities
should
be
taken
unless
their
representatives
at
chadlands
thought
otherwise
but
they
did
not
they
were
now
convinced
that
no
communication
existed
between
the
grey
room
and
the
outer
world
and
they
declared
their
determination
to
watch
in
it
during
the
coming
night
as
a
preliminary
to
this
course
however
they
examined
each
piece
of
furniture
and
every
picture
and
other
object
that
they
had
removed
from
the
room
these
told
them
nothing
and
presently
they
restored
the
chamber
in
every
particular
and
nailed
the
carpet
and
placed
each
article
as
it
had
stood
when
they
arrived
they
continued
to
decline
assistance
and
made
it
clear
that
nobody
was
to
approach
the
end
of
the
corridor
in
which
they
worked
alive
to
the
danger
but
believing
that
whatever
its
quality
four
men
could
hardly
be
simultaneously
destroyed
they
prepared
for
their
vigil
nor
did
they
manifest
any
fear
of
what
awaited
them
facts
indeed
may
be
stubborn
things
but
even
facts
will
not
upset
the
convictions
of
a
lifetime
not
one
of
the
four
for
an
instant
imagined
that
a
supernatural
explanation
of
the
mystery
existed
their
minds
were
open
and
their
wits
long
trained
in
problems
obscure
and
difficult
assured
them
that
the
problem
was
capable
of
solution
and
within
the
power
of
their
wits
to
solve
they
apprehended
no
discovery
from
the
watch
to
be
undertaken
but
at
frith
orders
they
set
stolidly
about
it
as
a
preliminary
to
the
proceedings
of
the
following
day
once
proved
that
the
murderous
force
was
powerless
against
men
prepared
and
armed
against
it
and
the
practical
inquiry
as
to
these
strange
deaths
would
be
entered
upon
they
came
with
full
powers
and
designed
to
search
the
house
without
warning
on
the
following
morning
and
examine
all
who
dwelt
in
it
sir
walter
invited
them
to
dine
with
him
and
they
did
so
there
were
present
the
master
of
chadlands
mannering
who
asked
to
spend
the
night
there
and
henry
lennox
while
masters
and
fred
caunter
waited
upon
them
the
detectives
heard
with
interest
the
result
of
the
conducted
during
the
morning
and
related
incidents
in
the
life
of
peter
hardcastle
they
were
all
unfeignedly
amazed
that
a
man
with
such
a
record
one
who
had
carried
his
life
in
his
hand
on
many
occasions
should
have
lost
it
thus
at
noonday
and
without
a
sound
of
warning
to
his
mannering
told
how
he
had
watched
the
medical
examination
but
not
assisted
at
it
all
attempts
to
galvanize
back
life
failed
as
the
experts
engaged
immediately
perceived
they
must
upon
viewing
the
corpse
and
during
the
subsequent
autopsy
when
the
dead
man
body
had
been
examined
by
chemist
and
microscopist
the
result
was
barren
of
any
pathological
detail
no
indication
to
explain
his
death
rewarded
the
search
not
a
clue
or
suspicion
existed
he
was
healthy
in
every
particular
and
his
destruction
remained
so
far
inexplicable
to
science
hardcastle
had
died
in
a
syncope
as
the
other
victims
that
was
all
the
most
learned
could
declare
impressed
by
these
facts
the
four
made
ready
and
lennox
observed
that
they
neither
drank
during
their
meal
nor
smoked
after
it
at
nine
they
began
their
work
of
the
night
but
invited
nobody
to
assist
them
and
begged
that
they
might
not
be
approached
until
daylight
on
the
following
morning
mannering
took
it
upon
himself
earnestly
to
beg
they
would
abandon
the
vigil
indeed
he
argued
strongly
against
it
consider
gentlemen
he
said
you
are
now
possibly
convinced
in
your
own
minds
that
the
source
of
these
horrible
things
is
to
be
found
outside
the
grey
room
and
not
in
it
i
agree
with
you
so
far
we
have
reached
a
pitch
where
in
my
judgment
we
are
justified
in
believing
that
some
motiveless
malignity
is
at
work
but
by
going
into
that
room
are
you
not
giving
somebody
another
opportunity
to
do
what
has
already
been
done
evil
performed
without
motive
as
you
know
better
than
i
can
tell
you
must
be
the
work
of
a
maniac
and
there
may
exist
in
this
house
unsuspected
and
unguessed
a
servant
afflicted
in
this
awful
way
one
has
heard
of
such
things
the
eldest
of
his
listeners
felt
unspeakable
interest
in
these
remarks
since
his
own
opinion
inclined
in
the
same
direction
he
was
however
none
the
less
chagrined
that
another
should
thus
voice
his
secret
theory
he
did
not
answer
but
his
chief
replied
it
is
proved
said
frith
that
no
violence
overtakes
those
subjected
to
this
ordeal
and
i
have
decided
that
we
shall
not
be
in
danger
for
this
reason
we
shall
be
armed
as
none
of
the
dead
were
our
precautions
will
preclude
any
possibility
of
foul
play
from
a
material
assault
and
needless
to
say
we
contemplate
no
other
we
are
free
agents
and
i
should
not
quarrel
with
any
among
us
who
shirked
but
duty
is
duty
and
we
have
all
faced
dangers
as
great
as
this
probably
far
greater
what
you
say
is
most
interesting
doctor
and
i
agree
with
you
that
outside
the
room
we
must
look
for
the
explanation
of
these
murders
if
murders
they
are
upon
that
business
we
shall
start
forgive
me
for
not
going
into
details
because
we
have
our
personal
methods
they
embrace
the
element
of
surprise
and
of
course
prevent
any
conversation
concerning
what
we
are
going
to
do
until
we
have
done
it
supposing
you
are
all
found
dead
asked
mannering
bluntly
then
we
are
all
found
dead
and
others
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
finding
out
why
you
suspect
somebody
yet
can
absolve
nobody
exactly
sir
walter
i
said
pretty
much
that
to
the
pressmen
who
forced
themselves
in
this
afternoon
the
accursed
daily
press
of
this
country
has
saved
the
skin
of
more
blackguards
than
i
like
to
count
keep
them
and
the
photographers
away
it
ought
to
be
criminal
their
interference
i
ordered
that
none
was
to
be
admitted
for
a
moment
it
is
always
very
hard
to
keep
them
out
they
are
cunning
devils
and
take
a
perverse
pleasure
in
adding
to
our
difficulties
little
they
care
how
they
defeat
justice
if
they
can
only
get
for
their
infernal
newspapers
inspector
frith
spoke
with
some
warmth
he
had
little
for
which
to
thank
the
popular
press
within
an
hour
the
four
departed
and
it
was
understood
that
they
should
not
be
disturbed
until
they
themselves
cared
to
reappear
mannering
remained
with
sir
walter
and
lennox
he
was
dejected
and
exceedingly
anxious
but
the
others
did
not
share
his
fears
the
younger
indeed
felt
hopeful
that
definite
results
might
presently
be
recorded
and
he
went
to
his
bed
very
thankful
to
get
there
but
sir
walter
now
calm
and
refreshed
by
some
hours
of
sleep
during
the
afternoon
designed
to
keep
his
own
vigil
poor
may
lies
in
my
library
he
said
and
i
shall
watch
beside
him
mary
also
wishes
to
do
so
it
seems
a
proper
respect
to
pay
the
dead
the
inquest
takes
place
and
he
will
be
buried
in
his
parish
we
must
attend
the
funeral
mary
and
i
if
ever
a
man
took
his
own
life
that
man
did
declared
the
doctor
chapter
ix
the
night
watch
though
a
room
had
been
prepared
for
mannering
he
did
not
occupy
it
long
the
early
hours
of
night
found
him
in
a
bad
temper
and
suffering
from
considerable
exacerbation
of
nerves
he
troubled
little
for
himself
and
still
less
concerning
the
police
for
he
was
human
and
their
indifference
to
his
advice
annoyed
him
but
for
sir
walter
he
was
perturbed
and
did
not
like
the
arrangements
that
he
had
planned
the
doctor
however
designed
to
go
and
come
and
keep
an
eye
upon
the
old
man
and
he
hoped
that
the
master
of
chadlands
would
presently
sleep
if
only
in
his
study
chair
for
himself
he
suffered
a
somewhat
unpleasant
experience
toward
midnight
but
had
himself
to
thank
for
it
he
rested
for
an
hour
in
his
bedroom
then
went
downstairs
to
find
mary
and
her
father
sitting
quietly
together
in
the
great
library
they
were
both
reading
while
at
the
farther
end
where
a
risen
moon
already
frosted
the
lofty
windows
above
him
lay
septimus
may
in
his
coffin
mary
had
plucked
a
wealth
of
white
hothouse
flowers
which
stood
in
an
old
venetian
bowl
at
his
feet
sir
walter
was
solicitous
for
the
doctor
not
in
bed
he
exclaimed
this
is
too
bad
mannering
we
shall
have
you
ill
next
you
have
been
on
your
feet
for
countless
hours
and
much
lies
before
you
do
be
sensible
my
dear
fellow
and
take
some
rest
even
if
you
can
not
sleep
there
is
no
sleep
for
me
lord
knows
how
soon
i
may
be
wanted
by
those
fools
playing
with
fire
upstairs
we
can
not
interfere
for
myself
a
great
peace
has
descended
upon
me
now
that
initiative
and
the
need
for
controlling
and
directing
is
taken
out
of
my
hands
i
began
to
feel
this
when
poor
hardcastle
arrived
but
that
composure
was
sadly
shattered
i
am
even
prepared
for
the
needful
publicity
now
i
can
face
it
if
i
erred
in
the
matter
of
this
devoted
priest
i
shall
not
question
the
judgment
of
my
upon
me
fear
nothing
of
that
sort
answered
mannering
your
has
no
right
to
judge
you
and
the
law
with
all
its
faults
appreciates
logic
who
can
question
your
right
to
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
outside
human
knowledge
your
wisdom
may
be
questioned
but
not
your
right
plenty
would
have
felt
the
same
when
the
mind
of
man
finds
itself
groping
in
the
dark
you
will
see
that
in
the
huge
majority
of
cases
it
falls
back
upon
supernatural
explanations
for
mystery
this
fact
has
made
fortunes
for
not
a
few
who
profit
by
the
credulity
of
human
nature
faiths
are
founded
on
it
may
carried
too
many
guns
for
you
he
honestly
convinced
you
that
his
theory
of
his
son
death
was
the
correct
theory
and
i
for
one
though
i
deplore
the
fact
that
you
came
to
see
with
his
eyes
and
permitted
him
to
do
what
he
believed
was
his
duty
yet
should
be
the
last
to
think
your
action
open
to
judicial
blame
no
christian
judge
at
any
rate
would
have
the
least
right
to
question
you
in
a
word
there
is
no
case
yet
against
anybody
the
force
responsible
for
these
things
is
utterly
unknown
and
if
ill
betides
the
men
upstairs
that
is
only
another
argument
for
you
sir
walter
put
down
his
book
a
volume
of
pious
meditations
events
had
drawn
him
into
a
receptive
attitude
toward
religion
he
was
surprised
at
mannering
i
never
thought
to
hear
you
admit
as
much
as
that
how
strangely
the
currents
of
the
mind
ebb
and
flow
mannering
here
are
you
with
your
scepticism
apparently
weakening
while
i
feel
thankfully
assured
at
any
rate
for
the
moment
that
only
a
material
reason
accounts
for
these
disasters
why
asked
the
physician
because
against
the
powers
of
any
dark
spirit
septimus
may
was
safe
even
had
he
been
right
and
his
prayer
had
freed
such
a
being
and
cast
it
out
of
my
house
would
the
almighty
have
permitted
it
to
rend
and
destroy
the
agent
of
its
liberation
may
could
not
have
suffered
death
by
any
conscious
supernatural
means
if
our
faith
is
true
but
as
he
himself
said
when
he
came
here
after
the
death
of
his
boy
he
did
not
pretend
that
faith
in
god
rendered
a
human
being
superior
to
the
laws
of
matter
if
as
was
suggested
at
dinner
there
is
somebody
in
this
house
with
a
mind
unhinged
who
has
discovered
a
secret
of
nature
by
which
human
life
can
be
destroyed
and
leave
no
sign
then
this
dead
clergyman
was
of
course
as
powerless
against
such
a
hideous
danger
as
any
other
human
being
but
surely
such
a
theory
is
quite
as
wild
as
any
based
on
supernatural
assumptions
you
know
the
occupants
of
this
house
every
one
of
them
sir
walter
mary
knows
them
henry
knows
them
i
have
attended
most
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
is
there
one
against
whom
such
a
suspicion
can
be
entertained
not
one
indeed
could
the
war
have
made
a
difference
asked
mary
we
know
how
shell
shock
and
wounds
to
a
poor
man
head
had
often
left
him
apparently
sound
yet
in
reality
weakened
as
to
his
mind
yes
that
is
true
enough
and
when
the
unfortunate
men
get
back
into
everyday
life
from
the
hospitals
or
endeavor
to
resume
their
old
work
the
weakness
appears
i
have
seen
cases
but
of
all
the
men
in
chadlands
there
are
only
three
examples
of
any
such
catastrophe
i
know
a
few
in
the
village
none
where
one
can
speak
of
actual
insanity
however
here
there
is
only
fred
caunter
who
was
hurt
about
the
head
on
board
ship
but
the
injury
left
no
defect
fred
is
certainly
as
sane
as
i
am
perhaps
saner
admitted
sir
walter
do
think
i
really
imagine
there
is
anything
of
the
kind
here
added
mannering
but
if
these
four
men
are
in
a
condition
to
proceed
with
their
work
you
must
expect
them
to
make
a
searching
examination
of
everybody
in
the
house
and
they
may
find
a
good
number
of
nervous
and
hysterical
women
if
not
men
it
is
not
their
province
however
to
determine
whether
people
are
weak
in
the
head
and
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
none
in
this
house
had
any
hand
in
these
disasters
never
was
a
family
with
fewer
secrets
than
mine
declared
sir
walter
the
morning
may
bring
light
said
mary
i
feel
very
little
hope
that
it
will
answered
mannering
the
inquiry
will
proceed
whatever
happens
and
we
may
all
have
to
go
to
london
to
attend
it
after
they
have
turned
chadlands
and
everybody
in
it
upside
down
as
they
surely
will
then
we
may
be
called
if
they
arrive
at
no
conclusion
i
am
prepared
to
be
i
shall
not
leave
the
country
of
course
until
i
receive
permission
to
do
so
it
must
be
apparent
to
everybody
that
i
am
of
all
men
if
not
the
most
involved
at
least
the
most
anxious
to
clear
this
mystery
that
nobody
can
doubt
then
you
must
conserve
your
strength
and
be
guided
said
mannering
i
do
beg
of
you
to
retire
now
and
insist
upon
mary
doing
the
same
nothing
can
be
gained
by
the
dead
and
necessary
energy
is
lost
to
the
living
by
this
irrational
vigil
it
is
far
past
midnight
i
beg
you
to
retire
sir
walter
and
mary
too
there
is
nothing
that
should
keep
you
out
of
bed
and
i
urge
you
to
go
to
it
but
the
elder
refused
few
will
sleep
under
this
roof
he
said
there
is
a
spirit
of
human
anxiety
and
distress
apparent
and
naturally
so
i
will
stay
here
with
this
good
man
he
is
better
company
than
many
of
the
living
i
feel
a
great
peace
here
the
dead
sustains
me
he
joined
mannering
however
in
an
appeal
to
his
daughter
and
satisfied
that
their
friend
would
not
be
far
off
at
any
time
mary
presently
left
them
she
declared
herself
as
not
anxious
or
nervous
she
had
never
believed
that
anything
but
natural
causes
were
responsible
for
her
husband
death
and
felt
an
assurance
that
morning
would
bring
some
measure
at
least
of
explanation
she
went
out
of
the
room
with
mannering
and
promising
her
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
her
father
the
doctor
left
mary
lighted
his
pipe
and
strolled
to
the
presently
he
patrolled
the
hall
and
pursued
his
own
reflections
where
his
thoughts
bent
there
his
body
unconsciously
turned
and
forgetting
the
injunction
of
the
silent
men
aloft
indeed
forgetting
them
also
for
a
moment
mannering
ascended
the
stairs
and
proceeded
along
the
corridor
toward
the
grey
room
but
he
did
not
get
far
out
of
the
darkness
a
figure
rose
and
stopped
him
the
man
turned
an
electric
torch
on
mannering
and
recognized
him
it
appeared
that
while
one
detective
kept
guard
outside
the
others
watched
within
at
the
sound
of
voices
the
door
of
the
grey
room
opened
and
in
the
bright
light
that
streamed
from
it
a
weird
figure
stood
a
tall
black
object
with
huge
and
flashing
eyes
and
what
looked
like
an
elephant
trunk
descending
from
between
them
the
watchers
wearing
hoods
and
gas
masks
resembled
the
fantastic
demons
of
a
salvator
rosa
or
fuselli
their
chief
now
accosted
the
doctor
somewhat
sharply
he
knew
his
name
and
received
his
apology
but
bade
him
leave
the
corridor
at
once
i
must
however
search
you
first
said
frith
you
were
wrong
to
come
he
continued
this
is
no
time
to
distract
us
explain
please
the
doctor
after
holding
up
his
hands
and
submitting
to
a
very
close
scrutiny
departed
and
swore
at
his
own
inadvertence
he
had
forgotten
that
in
common
with
everybody
else
involved
he
must
bear
the
brunt
of
suspicion
and
he
perceived
that
his
approach
to
the
grey
room
after
it
was
clearly
understood
that
none
should
on
any
account
attempt
to
do
so
must
attract
unpleasant
attention
to
himself
and
he
could
offer
no
better
excuse
than
that
he
had
forgotten
the
order
he
apprehended
an
unpleasantness
on
the
following
day
and
wondered
at
himself
that
he
could
have
done
anything
so
open
to
question
brain
fag
was
a
poor
excuse
but
he
had
none
better
in
an
hour
he
returned
to
sir
walter
hoping
to
find
him
asleep
but
the
master
of
chadlands
was
still
reading
and
in
a
frame
of
mind
very
quiet
and
peaceful
he
regretted
the
forgetfulness
that
had
taken
his
friend
into
the
forbidden
gallery
i
am
concerned
for
mary
he
said
she
is
only
keeping
up
at
a
terrible
cost
of
nervous
power
it
is
more
than
time
that
she
was
away
but
she
will
not
go
until
i
am
able
to
accompany
her
it
should
not
be
long
we
must
hope
they
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
soon
if
not
i
am
most
anxious
for
both
of
you
to
be
off
we
design
to
go
to
italy
she
shrinks
from
the
riviera
and
longs
for
florence
or
some
such
peaceful
place
it
will
be
cold
there
cold
wo
hurt
us
shall
you
shut
up
chadlands
impossible
it
is
the
only
home
of
half
my
elder
people
but
if
nothing
is
discovered
and
we
are
still
left
without
an
explanation
i
shall
seal
the
grey
room
windows
door
and
hearth
unless
the
authorities
direct
otherwise
i
wish
i
could
fill
the
place
with
solid
stone
or
concrete
so
that
it
would
cease
to
be
a
room
at
all
that
you
ca
do
answered
the
practical
doctor
such
a
weight
would
bring
down
the
ceiling
beneath
but
you
can
make
it
fast
and
block
it
up
if
the
thing
beats
them
we
are
like
the
blind
moving
in
regions
unfamiliar
to
their
touch
said
sir
walter
i
had
hoped
so
much
from
the
prayer
of
that
just
man
he
indeed
has
gone
to
his
reward
he
is
with
the
boy
he
loved
better
than
anything
on
earth
but
for
us
is
left
great
sorrow
and
distress
still
prayers
continue
to
be
answered
mannering
i
have
prayed
for
patience
and
i
find
myself
patient
the
iron
has
entered
my
soul
the
horror
of
publicity
the
morbid
agony
i
experienced
when
i
knew
my
name
must
be
dragged
through
every
newspaper
in
england
these
pangs
are
past
my
life
seems
to
have
ended
in
one
sense
and
looking
back
i
can
not
fail
to
see
how
little
i
grasped
the
realities
of
existence
how
i
took
my
easy
days
as
a
matter
of
course
and
never
imagined
that
for
me
too
extreme
suffering
and
misery
were
lying
in
wait
each
man
own
burden
seems
the
hardest
to
bear
i
imagine
and
to
me
these
events
have
shrivelled
the
very
marrow
in
my
bones
they
scorched
me
and
the
glare
thrown
from
the
larger
world
into
the
privacy
of
my
life
made
me
feel
that
i
could
call
on
the
hills
to
cover
me
but
now
i
can
endure
all
you
must
not
look
at
it
so
sir
walter
everybody
knows
that
you
have
done
no
wrong
and
if
your
judgment
is
questioned
what
is
it
only
the
fate
every
man
great
or
small
famous
or
insignificant
has
to
bear
you
ca
escape
criticism
in
this
world
any
more
than
you
can
escape
calumny
it
is
something
that
you
can
now
speak
so
steadfastly
preserve
such
patience
and
see
so
clearly
too
but
for
my
part
clear
seeing
only
increases
my
anxiety
i
do
personally
care
a
button
for
the
welfare
of
those
men
since
they
declined
to
take
my
advice
but
i
am
human
and
as
i
suffer
with
a
sick
patient
and
rejoice
when
he
recovers
so
i
can
not
help
suffering
at
the
thought
of
the
risk
these
four
are
running
they
sit
there
i
suppose
or
else
walk
about
they
wear
gas
masks
and
carry
weapons
in
their
hands
but
if
we
are
opposed
to
a
blind
deaf
unreasoning
force
which
acts
unconsciously
and
inevitably
then
the
fate
of
ten
men
would
be
just
as
uncertain
as
the
fate
of
one
the
thing
operates
by
day
or
night
that
much
has
been
proved
and
since
it
is
probably
acting
automatically
as
lightning
or
steam
how
can
they
escape
this
invisible
force
may
be
in
the
control
of
a
human
mind
remember
it
is
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
sir
walter
you
are
a
rash
man
to
affirm
anything
so
definite
after
what
you
have
gone
through
with
the
rest
of
us
let
me
in
my
turn
urge
you
to
go
to
your
rest
these
things
have
told
upon
you
you
are
only
flesh
and
blood
not
iron
as
you
fancy
the
men
are
all
right
so
far
i
get
something
to
eat
and
drink
said
mannering
and
leave
you
in
peace
for
a
while
do
you
will
find
all
you
need
in
the
i
directed
masters
to
leave
ample
there
in
case
the
detectives
might
want
food
shall
i
bring
you
something
a
whisky
and
a
biscuit
no
no
i
need
nothing
the
doctor
went
his
way
and
passed
an
hour
with
meat
and
drink
then
he
felt
an
overpowering
desire
to
sleep
but
resisted
it
lighted
his
pipe
again
and
resumed
his
march
in
the
hall
he
listened
presently
at
the
library
door
and
was
gratified
to
hear
a
gentle
but
steady
snore
the
sound
pleased
mannering
well
he
padded
about
once
more
resolved
to
keep
awake
until
the
vigil
was
ended
then
he
would
go
to
bed
and
sleep
it
was
now
past
three
on
a
still
winter
night
a
lull
and
interval
between
yesterday
storm
and
rough
weather
yet
to
come
the
doctor
went
out
of
doors
for
a
time
and
tramped
the
terrace
a
waning
moon
had
risen
and
the
night
was
mild
and
cloudy
bright
light
shot
out
like
fans
into
the
murk
from
the
east
and
south
windows
of
the
grey
room
returning
to
the
house
the
watcher
listened
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
heard
the
mumble
of
men
voices
and
the
sound
of
feet
they
were
changing
the
guard
and
the
detective
in
the
corridor
gave
up
his
place
to
one
from
inside
all
was
well
so
far
then
mannering
went
to
the
lolled
on
the
settee
for
a
time
and
drowsed
through
another
hour
for
a
few
minutes
he
lost
consciousness
started
up
to
blame
his
weakness
and
looked
at
his
watch
but
he
had
only
slumbered
for
five
minutes
at
six
he
told
himself
that
it
was
morning
and
went
in
again
to
sir
walter
the
old
man
had
wakened
and
was
sitting
in
quiet
reflection
until
daylight
should
outline
the
great
window
above
the
dead
the
night
has
been
one
of
peace
he
declared
the
spirit
of
poor
may
seemed
near
me
and
i
felt
too
as
though
his
son
were
not
far
off
either
is
all
well
with
the
watchers
i
leave
you
to
inquire
but
do
go
too
near
them
night
fades
over
the
woods
so
the
day
can
be
said
to
have
begun
doubtless
the
household
will
be
stirring
i
shall
go
and
inquire
if
they
will
permit
me
to
do
so
oblige
me
by
staying
here
a
few
minutes
until
i
call
my
daughter
i
do
not
want
our
poor
friend
to
be
alone
until
he
leaves
us
i
will
stay
here
for
the
present
but
do
let
mary
be
called
if
she
is
sleeping
and
turn
in
yourself
for
a
few
hours
now
i
have
slept
off
and
on
sir
walter
left
him
and
ascended
to
the
corridor
already
light
moved
wanly
in
the
windows
he
stood
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
raised
his
voice
is
all
well
gentlemen
he
asked
loudly
but
he
received
no
answer
is
all
well
he
cried
again
and
then
from
the
gloom
emerged
inspector
frith
he
had
doffed
his
gas
mask
sir
walter
switched
on
an
electric
light
nothing
i
trust
has
happened
nothing
whatever
sir
walter
no
sign
or
sound
of
anything
out
of
the
common
can
be
recorded
thank
heaven
thank
heaven
for
that
though
we
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
such
a
thing
we
none
the
less
expected
gas
explained
the
detective
that
seemed
the
only
conceivable
means
by
which
life
might
be
destroyed
in
that
room
therefore
we
wore
gas
masks
of
the
latest
pattern
supposed
to
defy
any
gaseous
combination
ever
turned
out
of
a
laboratory
it
is
well
known
that
new
destructive
gases
were
discovered
just
before
the
end
of
the
war
gases
said
to
be
infinitely
more
speedy
and
deadly
than
any
that
were
employed
as
to
that
and
whether
the
government
has
the
secret
of
them
i
can
not
say
but
no
gas
was
liberated
in
the
grey
room
last
night
otherwise
a
rat
in
a
trap
and
birds
in
a
cage
which
we
kept
by
us
would
have
felt
it
the
room
is
pure
enough
sir
walter
followed
him
down
the
corridor
and
chatted
with
the
other
men
also
they
had
left
the
grey
room
and
taken
off
their
masks
they
looked
weary
and
haggard
in
the
waxing
white
light
of
day
you
done
your
duty
and
i
am
beyond
measure
thankful
that
no
evil
has
overtaken
you
what
can
now
be
prepared
for
you
in
the
way
of
food
they
thanked
him
and
declared
that
in
an
hour
they
would
be
glad
of
breakfast
then
sir
walter
went
to
his
own
apartments
rang
and
gave
the
needful
directions
he
joined
mary
soon
afterwards
and
she
shared
his
thanksgivings
she
was
already
dressed
and
descended
immediately
to
mannering
henry
lennox
also
appeared
soon
afterwards
he
had
already
learned
from
fred
caunter
that
the
watchers
were
safely
through
the
night
chadlands
was
the
scene
of
another
inquest
and
again
a
coroner
jury
declared
that
septimus
may
as
his
son
before
him
had
died
by
the
hand
of
god
later
in
the
day
the
dead
man
was
conveyed
to
his
own
parish
and
two
days
later
sir
walter
and
mary
with
her
cousin
attended
the
funeral
meantime
the
detectives
began
their
serious
work
they
proceeded
with
system
and
upon
their
own
plan
they
omitted
to
question
not
the
least
of
the
persons
who
dwelt
at
chadlands
and
inquired
also
privately
concerning
every
member
of
the
house
party
there
assembled
when
tom
may
died
into
the
sailor
private
life
they
also
searched
and
so
gradually
investigated
every
possible
line
of
action
and
point
of
approach
to
his
death
the
cause
of
this
they
were
content
to
disregard
arguing
that
if
an
assassin
could
be
traced
his
means
of
murder
would
then
be
learned
but
from
the
first
no
sort
of
light
illumined
their
activities
and
nothing
to
be
regarded
as
a
clue
could
be
discovered
either
in
tom
may
relations
with
the
world
or
in
the
history
and
character
of
anyone
among
the
many
who
were
subject
for
inquiry
concerning
the
house
party
only
ernest
travers
and
his
wife
had
met
the
sailor
before
on
the
occasion
of
his
wedding
while
as
to
the
staff
at
chadlands
nothing
transpired
to
indicate
that
any
had
ever
had
occasion
to
feel
affronted
by
an
act
of
his
they
were
moreover
loyal
to
a
man
and
woman
they
furnished
no
peculiarities
and
gave
no
ground
for
the
least
suspicion
the
case
in
frith
opinion
was
unique
because
despite
the
number
of
persons
it
was
necessary
to
study
and
consider
in
none
of
their
relations
with
the
family
involved
could
there
be
found
a
shadow
of
unfriendly
intercourse
a
harbored
grudge
or
a
suggestion
of
the
people
were
all
simple
and
ingenuous
they
declared
and
displayed
nothing
but
regard
for
their
employer
and
many
of
them
had
succeeded
their
own
parents
in
their
present
employment
it
was
a
large
household
very
closely
united
by
ties
of
tradition
and
affection
henry
lennox
also
proved
above
suspicion
though
his
former
attachment
to
mary
was
not
concealed
it
needed
no
great
student
of
character
however
to
appreciate
his
transparent
honesty
under
examination
a
remark
that
extended
to
mannering
whose
incautious
advent
in
the
corridor
on
the
night
of
their
vigil
had
offended
the
watchers
for
three
weeks
they
worked
industriously
without
vision
but
to
the
best
of
their
experience
and
intellectual
powers
in
the
familiar
phrase
they
left
no
stone
unturned
and
following
their
report
which
frankly
admitted
absolute
failure
a
small
commission
instituted
a
further
inquiry
on
the
evidence
and
invited
those
chiefly
concerned
to
attend
it
sir
walter
his
daughter
henry
lennox
and
mannering
were
examined
with
sympathy
and
consideration
but
they
could
offer
no
opinions
throw
no
light
and
suggest
no
other
lines
of
inquiry
than
those
already
pursued
for
the
world
the
mystery
died
like
a
new
star
which
was
blazed
into
fame
only
to
retreat
or
diminish
and
disappear
once
more
fresh
problems
and
new
sensations
filled
the
newspapers
and
a
time
at
last
came
when
to
his
relief
sir
walter
could
open
his
morning
journal
and
find
no
mention
of
chadlands
therein
architects
examined
the
room
a
second
time
and
the
authorities
also
gave
permission
to
certain
notable
spiritualists
to
make
further
nocturnal
and
diurnal
vigils
therein
though
no
solitary
watcher
was
permitted
three
came
and
passed
a
day
and
a
night
in
the
grey
room
they
were
rewarded
with
no
phenomena
whatever
the
master
of
chadlands
was
at
length
informed
that
he
might
leave
england
but
directed
to
set
a
seal
on
the
grey
room
and
to
treat
it
in
such
a
manner
that
it
should
no
longer
be
capable
of
entrance
the
red
tape
that
had
wound
itself
about
the
tragedy
was
thus
unloosed
at
last
and
the
suffering
pair
made
all
haste
to
get
away
its
owner
undertook
to
treat
the
grey
room
as
directed
on
his
return
from
abroad
and
meanwhile
had
both
door
and
window
boarded
up
with
heavy
timbers
the
household
was
long
since
restored
to
and
even
cheerfulness
some
felt
pride
in
their
passing
publicity
and
none
expressed
any
fear
of
remaining
but
sir
walter
guessed
that
few
feet
would
tread
the
great
corridor
until
a
day
was
near
for
his
return
chapter
signor
vergilio
mannetti
sir
walter
persisted
in
his
purpose
and
went
to
florence
he
believed
that
here
mary
might
find
distractions
and
novelties
to
awaken
interest
which
would
come
freshly
into
her
life
without
the
pain
and
poignancy
of
any
recollection
to
lessen
the
work
of
peace
for
himself
he
only
desired
to
see
her
returning
to
content
happiness
he
knew
must
be
a
condition
far
removed
from
her
spirit
for
many
days
they
stood
one
evening
on
the
piazza
of
michelangelo
and
saw
florence
like
a
city
of
dim
red
gold
extended
beneath
them
the
setting
sunlight
wove
an
enchantment
over
towers
and
roofs
it
spread
a
veil
of
ineffable
brightness
upon
the
city
and
tinged
green
arno
also
where
the
river
wound
through
the
midst
sir
walter
was
quietly
happy
because
he
knew
that
in
a
fortnight
his
friends
ernest
and
nelly
travers
would
be
at
florence
mary
too
prepared
to
welcome
them
gladly
for
her
father
sake
he
left
his
daughter
largely
undisturbed
and
while
they
took
their
walks
together
the
old
man
to
whom
neither
music
nor
pictures
conveyed
much
significance
let
her
wander
at
will
and
the
more
readily
because
he
found
that
art
was
beginning
to
exercise
a
precious
influence
over
mary
mind
there
was
none
to
guide
her
studies
but
she
pursued
them
with
a
plan
of
her
own
and
though
at
first
the
effort
sometimes
left
her
weary
yet
she
persisted
until
she
began
to
perceive
at
least
the
immensity
of
the
knowledge
she
desired
to
acquire
music
soothed
her
mind
painting
offered
an
interest
part
sensuous
part
intellectual
perhaps
she
loved
music
best
at
first
since
it
brought
a
direct
anodyne
in
the
sound
of
music
she
could
bear
to
think
of
her
brief
love
story
she
even
made
her
father
come
and
listen
presently
to
things
that
she
began
to
value
their
minds
inevitably
proceeded
by
different
channels
of
thought
and
while
she
strove
resolutely
to
occupy
herself
with
the
new
interests
and
put
away
the
agony
of
the
past
till
thinking
was
bearable
again
and
a
road
to
peace
under
her
feet
once
more
sir
walter
seldom
found
himself
passing
many
hours
without
recurrence
of
painful
memories
and
a
sustained
longing
to
strip
the
darkness
which
buried
them
to
his
forthright
and
simple
intelligence
mystery
was
hateful
and
the
reflection
that
his
home
must
for
ever
hold
a
profound
and
appalling
mystery
often
thrust
itself
upon
his
thoughts
and
even
inclined
him
in
some
moods
to
see
chadlands
no
more
yet
a
natural
longing
to
return
to
the
old
environment
in
which
he
could
move
with
ease
and
comfort
gradually
mastered
him
and
as
the
spring
advanced
he
often
sighed
for
devonshire
yet
wondered
how
he
could
do
so
then
would
return
the
gloomy
history
of
the
winter
rolling
over
his
spirit
like
a
cloud
and
the
thought
of
going
home
again
grew
distasteful
mary
however
knew
her
father
well
enough
and
at
this
lustrous
hour
while
florence
stretched
beneath
them
in
its
quiet
evening
beauty
she
declared
that
they
must
not
much
longer
delay
their
return
plenty
of
time
he
said
i
am
not
too
old
to
learn
i
find
and
a
man
would
indeed
be
a
great
fool
if
he
could
not
learn
in
such
a
place
as
this
but
though
art
can
never
mean
much
to
me
now
your
case
is
different
and
i
am
thankful
to
know
that
these
things
will
be
a
great
addition
and
interest
to
your
future
life
i
a
philistine
and
shall
always
so
remain
but
i
a
repentant
one
i
see
my
mistake
too
late
it
a
new
world
father
she
said
and
it
has
done
a
great
deal
for
an
unhappy
woman
not
only
in
taking
my
thoughts
off
myself
but
in
lessening
my
suffering
too
i
do
not
know
why
or
how
but
music
and
these
great
solemn
pictures
painted
by
dead
men
all
touch
my
thoughts
of
dear
tom
i
seem
to
see
that
there
are
so
many
more
mighty
ones
dead
than
living
and
yet
not
dead
they
live
in
what
they
have
made
and
tom
lives
in
what
he
made
that
was
my
love
for
him
and
his
for
me
he
grows
nearer
and
dearer
than
ever
when
i
hear
beautiful
music
i
can
better
bear
to
think
of
him
at
such
times
and
it
will
always
help
me
to
remember
him
god
bless
art
if
it
does
so
much
he
said
we
come
to
it
as
little
children
and
i
shall
always
be
a
child
and
never
understand
but
for
you
the
valuable
message
will
be
received
may
life
never
turn
you
away
from
these
things
in
years
to
come
never
never
she
assured
him
art
has
done
too
much
for
me
i
shall
not
try
to
live
my
life
without
it
already
i
feel
i
could
not
what
have
you
seen
he
asked
i
was
at
the
pitti
all
the
morning
i
liked
best
fra
great
altar
piece
and
titian
portrait
of
cardinal
ippolito
dei
medici
you
must
see
him
a
strange
unhappy
spirit
only
years
old
two
years
afterwards
he
was
poisoned
and
his
haunted
discontented
eyes
closed
for
ever
and
the
so
wonderful
with
such
a
expression
in
the
soul
of
the
player
and
andrea
del
sarto
how
gracious
and
noble
but
henry
james
says
he
because
his
mind
was
so
i
suppose
he
is
but
not
to
me
he
never
will
be
to
me
you
must
come
and
see
some
of
the
things
i
specially
love
i
wo
bore
you
i
do
know
enough
to
bore
you
yet
oh
and
allori
so
lovely
but
i
wonder
if
allori
did
justice
to
her
certainly
his
could
never
have
done
what
the
real
judith
did
and
there
a
landscape
by
rubens
dark
and
old
yet
it
reminded
me
of
our
woods
where
they
open
out
above
the
valley
he
devoted
the
next
morning
to
mary
and
wandered
among
the
pictures
with
her
he
strove
to
share
her
enthusiasm
and
indeed
did
so
sometimes
then
occurred
a
little
incident
so
trivial
that
they
forgot
all
about
it
within
an
hour
yet
were
reminded
of
it
at
a
very
startling
moment
now
fast
approaching
they
had
separated
and
sir
walter
eye
was
caught
by
a
portrait
but
he
forgot
it
a
moment
later
in
passing
interest
of
a
blazoned
coat
of
arms
upon
the
frame
a
golden
bull
head
on
a
red
ground
the
heraldic
emblem
was
tarnished
and
inconspicuous
yet
the
spectator
felt
curiously
conscious
that
it
was
not
unfamiliar
it
seemed
that
he
had
seen
it
already
somewhere
he
challenged
mary
with
it
presently
but
she
had
never
observed
it
before
to
her
recollection
sir
walter
enjoyed
his
daughter
interest
and
finding
that
his
company
among
the
pictures
added
to
mary
pleasure
while
his
comments
caused
her
no
apparent
pain
he
declared
his
intention
of
seeing
more
you
must
tell
me
what
you
know
he
said
it
will
be
the
blind
leading
the
blind
dearest
she
answered
but
my
delight
must
be
in
finding
things
i
think
you
like
the
truth
is
that
neither
of
us
knows
anything
about
what
we
ought
to
like
that
a
very
small
matter
he
declared
we
must
begin
by
learning
to
like
pictures
at
all
when
ernest
comes
he
will
want
us
to
live
in
his
great
touring
car
and
fly
about
so
we
should
use
our
present
time
to
the
best
advantage
pictures
do
not
attract
him
and
he
will
be
very
much
surprised
to
hear
that
i
have
been
looking
at
them
we
must
interest
him
too
if
we
can
that
would
be
impossible
ernest
does
not
understand
pictures
and
music
gives
him
no
pleasure
he
regards
art
with
suspicion
as
a
somewhat
unmanly
thing
poor
mr
travers
do
not
pity
him
mary
his
life
is
sufficiently
full
without
it
but
i
lived
to
find
out
that
no
life
can
be
in
due
course
ernest
and
nelly
arrived
and
as
sir
walter
had
prophesied
their
pleasure
consisted
in
long
motor
drives
to
neighboring
places
and
scenes
of
interest
and
beauty
his
daughter
in
the
new
light
that
was
glimmering
for
her
found
her
father
friends
had
shrunk
a
little
she
could
speak
with
them
and
share
their
interests
less
than
of
old
but
they
set
it
down
to
her
tribulation
and
tried
to
rouse
her
ernest
travers
even
lamented
her
interests
and
hoped
they
were
only
a
passing
phase
she
appears
to
escape
from
reality
into
a
world
of
pictures
and
music
he
said
you
must
guard
against
that
my
dear
walter
these
things
can
be
of
no
permanent
interest
to
a
healthy
mind
for
a
fortnight
they
saw
much
of
their
friends
and
mary
observed
how
her
father
expanded
in
the
atmosphere
of
ernest
and
nelly
they
understood
each
other
so
well
and
echoed
so
many
similar
sentiments
and
convictions
ernest
entertained
a
poor
opinion
of
the
italian
character
he
argued
that
a
nation
which
depended
for
its
prosperity
on
wines
and
silk
and
such
wines
must
have
too
much
of
the
feminine
in
it
to
excel
he
had
a
shadowy
idea
that
he
understood
the
language
though
he
could
not
speak
nor
write
it
himself
we
who
have
been
nurtured
at
eton
and
oxford
remember
enough
latin
to
understand
these
people
he
said
for
what
is
italian
but
the
emasculated
tongue
of
ancient
rome
nelly
travers
committed
herself
to
many
utterances
as
idiotic
as
ernest
and
mary
secretly
wondered
to
find
how
shadowy
and
ridiculous
such
solid
people
showed
in
a
strange
land
they
carried
their
ignorance
and
their
parochial
atmosphere
with
them
as
openly
and
unashamedly
as
they
carried
their
luggage
she
was
not
sorry
to
leave
them
for
she
and
her
father
intended
to
stop
for
a
while
at
como
before
returning
home
again
their
friends
were
going
to
motor
over
the
battlefields
of
france
presently
and
both
ernest
and
nelly
came
to
see
sir
walter
and
his
daughter
off
for
milan
travers
rushed
to
the
door
of
the
carriage
and
thrust
in
a
newspaper
as
the
train
moved
i
have
secured
a
copy
of
last
week
walter
he
said
they
passed
over
the
apennines
on
a
night
when
the
flashed
in
every
thicket
under
the
starry
gloom
of
a
clear
and
moonless
sky
and
when
the
train
stopped
at
little
silent
stations
the
throb
of
nightingales
fell
upon
their
ears
but
circumstances
prevented
their
visit
to
the
larian
lake
for
at
milan
letters
awaited
sir
walter
from
home
and
among
them
one
that
hastened
his
return
from
a
stranger
it
came
and
chance
willed
that
the
writer
an
italian
had
actually
made
the
journey
from
rome
to
london
in
order
that
he
might
see
sir
walter
while
all
the
time
the
master
of
chadlands
happened
to
be
within
half
a
day
travel
now
the
writer
was
still
in
london
and
proposed
to
stop
there
until
he
should
receive
an
answer
to
his
communication
he
wrote
guardedly
and
made
one
statement
of
extraordinary
gravity
he
was
concerned
with
the
mystery
of
the
grey
room
and
believed
that
he
might
throw
some
light
upon
the
melancholy
incidents
recorded
concerning
it
sir
walter
hesitated
for
mary
sake
but
was
relieved
when
she
suggested
a
prompt
return
it
would
be
folly
to
delay
she
said
this
means
quite
as
much
to
me
as
to
you
father
and
i
could
not
go
to
como
knowing
there
may
be
even
the
least
gleam
of
light
for
us
at
home
nothing
can
alter
the
past
but
if
it
were
possible
to
explain
how
and
why
what
an
unutterable
relief
to
us
both
henry
was
to
meet
us
at
menaggio
he
will
be
as
thankful
as
we
are
if
anything
comes
of
this
he
leave
england
till
thursday
and
can
join
us
at
chadlands
instead
i
only
live
to
explain
these
things
confessed
her
father
i
would
give
all
that
i
have
to
discover
reasons
for
the
death
of
your
dear
husband
but
there
are
terribly
grave
hints
here
i
can
hardly
imagine
this
man
is
justified
in
speaking
of
would
the
word
mean
less
to
him
than
to
us
he
writes
perfect
english
whatever
may
be
in
store
we
must
face
it
hopefully
such
things
do
not
happen
by
chance
he
is
evidently
a
gentleman
a
man
of
refinement
and
delicate
feeling
i
am
kindly
disposed
to
him
already
there
is
something
chivalric
and
what
is
called
in
his
expressions
no
young
man
writes
like
this
nowadays
the
letter
which
both
read
many
times
revealed
the
traits
that
sir
walter
declared
it
was
written
with
latin
courtesy
and
distinction
there
were
also
touches
of
humor
in
it
which
neither
he
nor
mary
perceived
claridge
hotel
london
april
dear
sir
walter
lennox
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
that
knows
england
i
have
recently
been
profoundly
interested
and
moved
at
the
amazing
events
reported
as
happening
at
chadlands
in
the
county
of
devon
under
your
roof
the
circumstances
were
related
in
italian
journals
with
no
great
detail
but
i
read
them
in
the
newspaper
being
familiar
with
your
language
and
a
great
lover
of
your
country
i
had
already
conceived
the
idea
of
communicating
with
you
when
so
small
is
the
world
in
this
our
time
accident
actually
threw
me
into
the
society
of
one
of
your
personal
friends
at
an
entertainment
given
by
the
british
ambassador
at
rome
a
young
soldier
one
colonel
vane
was
able
to
do
me
some
service
in
a
crush
of
people
and
i
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
his
acquaintance
as
the
result
i
would
not
have
inflicted
myself
upon
another
generation
but
he
took
an
interest
in
conversing
with
one
who
knew
his
own
language
he
was
also
intelligent
for
a
military
man
needless
to
say
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
tragedy
at
chadlands
but
when
he
spoke
of
espionage
in
war
and
kindred
matters
i
found
him
familiar
with
the
details
concerning
the
death
of
the
great
english
detective
peter
hardcastle
i
then
asked
him
as
being
myself
deeply
interested
in
the
matter
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
get
further
and
fuller
details
of
the
story
of
grey
room
whereupon
he
told
me
to
my
amazement
that
he
had
been
at
chadlands
when
your
lamented
captain
thomas
may
passed
out
of
life
i
then
recollected
colonel
vane
name
among
others
mentioned
in
the
as
at
chadlands
when
the
disaster
occurred
finding
that
my
curiosity
was
not
idle
colonel
vane
accepted
an
invitation
to
dinner
and
i
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
him
and
learning
many
personal
and
intimate
particulars
of
the
event
these
were
imparted
in
confidence
and
he
knew
that
i
should
not
abuse
his
trust
indeed
i
had
already
told
him
that
it
was
my
determination
to
communicate
with
you
upon
the
strength
of
his
narrative
it
seems
improbable
that
anything
i
can
say
will
bear
upon
the
case
and
i
may
presently
find
that
i
lack
the
means
to
serve
you
or
throw
light
where
all
is
so
profoundly
buried
in
darkness
yet
i
am
not
sure
small
things
will
often
lead
to
greater
and
though
the
past
is
unhappily
beyond
recall
since
our
maker
himself
can
not
undo
the
work
of
yesterday
or
obliterate
events
embalmed
in
vanished
time
yet
there
is
always
the
future
and
if
we
could
but
read
the
past
aright
which
we
never
can
then
the
future
would
prove
less
of
a
painful
riddle
than
mankind
generally
finds
it
if
then
i
can
help
you
to
read
the
past
i
may
at
least
modify
your
anxieties
in
the
future
and
should
i
by
a
remote
chance
be
right
in
my
suspicions
it
is
quite
imperative
that
i
place
myself
at
your
service
for
the
sake
of
mankind
in
a
word
a
great
crime
has
been
committed
and
the
situation
is
possibly
such
that
further
capital
crimes
will
follow
it
i
affirm
nothing
but
i
conceive
the
agency
responsible
for
these
murders
to
be
still
active
since
the
police
have
been
so
completely
foiled
at
chadlands
there
may
still
remain
an
unsleeping
danger
to
those
who
follow
you
a
danger
indeed
to
all
human
life
so
long
as
it
is
permitted
to
persist
i
write
of
course
assuming
you
to
be
desirous
of
clearing
this
abominable
mystery
both
for
your
own
satisfaction
and
the
credit
of
your
house
there
is
but
little
to
hope
from
me
and
i
would
beg
you
not
to
feel
sanguine
in
any
way
yet
this
i
do
believe
that
if
there
is
one
man
in
the
world
who
holds
the
key
of
your
tribulation
i
am
that
man
one
lives
in
hope
that
one
may
empty
the
world
of
so
great
a
horror
and
to
do
so
would
give
one
the
most
active
satisfaction
but
i
promise
nothing
if
i
should
be
on
the
right
track
however
let
me
explain
the
direction
in
which
my
mind
is
moving
human
knowledge
may
not
be
equal
to
any
solution
and
i
may
fail
accordingly
it
may
even
be
possible
that
the
rev
septimus
may
did
not
err
and
that
at
the
cost
of
his
life
he
exorcised
some
spirit
whose
operations
were
permitted
for
reasons
hid
in
the
mind
of
its
creator
but
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
believe
otherwise
and
if
i
should
prove
correct
it
will
be
possible
to
show
that
all
has
fallen
out
in
a
manner
consonant
with
human
reason
and
explicable
by
human
understanding
i
therefore
came
to
england
glad
of
the
excuse
to
do
so
and
waited
upon
you
at
your
manor
only
to
hear
much
to
my
chagrin
that
you
were
not
in
residence
but
had
gone
to
florence
a
bird
journey
from
my
own
home
now
i
write
to
the
at
milan
where
your
servant
directed
me
that
letters
should
for
the
moment
be
sent
if
you
are
returning
soon
i
wait
for
you
if
not
it
may
be
possible
to
meet
in
italy
but
i
should
prefer
to
think
you
return
ere
long
for
i
can
not
be
of
practical
service
until
i
have
myself
with
your
permission
visited
your
house
and
seen
the
grey
room
with
my
own
eyes
i
beg
you
will
accept
my
assurances
of
kindly
regard
and
sympathy
in
the
great
sufferings
you
and
madame
may
have
been
called
upon
to
endure
until
i
hear
from
you
i
remain
at
claridge
hotel
in
london
i
have
the
honor
to
be
faithfully
yours
vergilio
mannetti
to
this
communication
albeit
he
felt
little
hope
sir
walter
made
speedy
response
he
declared
his
intention
of
returning
to
england
during
the
following
week
after
which
he
hoped
that
signor
mannetti
would
visit
chadlands
at
any
time
convenient
to
himself
he
thanked
him
gratefully
but
feared
that
since
the
italian
based
his
theory
on
a
crime
he
could
not
feel
particularly
sanguine
for
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
had
proved
mary
however
looked
deeper
into
the
letter
she
even
suspected
that
the
writer
himself
entertained
a
greater
belief
in
his
powers
than
he
declared
one
has
always
felt
the
grey
room
is
somehow
associated
with
italy
she
said
the
ceiling
we
know
was
moulded
by
italians
in
day
it
was
but
so
are
all
the
other
moulded
ceilings
in
the
house
as
well
he
may
understand
italian
workmanship
and
know
some
similar
roof
that
hid
a
secret
the
roof
can
not
conceal
an
assassin
and
he
clearly
believes
himself
on
the
track
of
a
crime
nevertheless
sir
walter
interest
increased
as
the
hour
approached
for
their
return
home
only
when
that
was
decided
did
he
discover
how
much
he
longed
to
be
there
for
the
horror
and
suffering
of
the
past
were
a
little
dimmed
already
he
thirsted
to
see
his
woods
and
meadows
in
their
vernal
dress
to
hear
the
murmur
of
his
river
and
move
again
among
familiar
voices
and
familiar
paths
chadlands
welcomed
them
on
a
rare
evening
of
may
and
the
very
genuine
joy
of
his
people
moved
sir
walter
not
a
little
henry
lennox
was
already
arrived
and
deeply
interested
to
read
the
italian
letter
he
and
mary
walked
presently
in
the
gardens
and
he
found
her
changed
she
spoke
more
slowly
laughed
not
at
all
but
she
had
welcomed
him
with
affection
and
been
interested
to
learn
all
that
he
had
to
tell
her
of
himself
i
felt
that
it
would
disappoint
you
to
be
stopped
at
the
last
moment
she
said
but
i
knew
the
reason
would
satisfy
you
well
enough
i
feel
hopeful
somehow
father
does
not
yet
it
is
hope
mixed
with
fear
for
signor
mannetti
speaks
of
a
great
crime
a
vain
theory
i
afraid
tell
me
about
yourself
you
are
well
yes
very
well
you
must
come
to
italy
some
day
henry
and
let
me
show
you
the
wonderful
things
i
have
seen
i
should
dearly
love
it
i
such
a
goth
but
it
only
brutal
laziness
i
want
to
take
up
art
and
understand
a
little
of
what
it
really
matters
you
have
it
in
you
are
you
writing
any
more
poetry
nothing
worth
showing
you
she
exercised
the
old
fascination
but
he
indulged
in
no
hope
of
the
future
he
knew
what
her
husband
had
been
to
mary
despite
the
shortness
of
their
union
and
rightly
he
felt
positive
that
she
would
never
marry
again
a
mournful
spectacle
appeared
drawn
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
old
spaniel
prince
crept
to
mary
feet
he
offered
feeble
homage
and
she
made
much
of
him
but
the
dog
had
sunk
to
a
shadow
he
must
be
put
away
poor
old
beggar
it
cruel
to
keep
him
alive
only
masters
said
he
was
determined
he
should
not
go
while
uncle
walter
was
abroad
masters
has
been
a
mother
to
him
tell
father
that
he
may
blame
masters
for
letting
him
linger
on
like
this
he
rather
hoped
i
know
that
poor
prince
would
be
painlessly
destroyed
or
die
before
he
came
back
masters
would
never
have
let
him
die
unless
directed
to
do
so
and
i
sure
father
could
never
have
written
the
words
down
and
posted
them
you
know
father
letters
awaited
the
returned
travellers
one
from
colonel
vane
who
described
his
meeting
with
signor
mannetti
and
hoped
something
might
come
of
it
and
another
from
the
stranger
himself
he
expressed
satisfaction
at
his
invitation
and
proposed
arriving
at
chadlands
on
the
following
monday
unless
directions
reached
him
to
the
contrary
when
the
time
came
sir
walter
himself
went
into
exeter
to
meet
his
guest
and
bring
him
back
by
at
first
sight
of
the
signor
his
host
experienced
a
slight
shock
of
astonishment
to
mark
the
age
for
vergilio
mannetti
was
an
ancient
man
he
had
been
tall
but
now
stooped
and
though
not
decrepit
yet
he
needed
assistance
and
was
accompanied
and
attended
by
a
italian
the
traveller
displayed
a
distinguished
bearing
he
had
a
brown
face
the
skin
of
which
appeared
to
have
shrunk
rather
than
wrinkled
yet
no
suggestion
of
a
mummy
accompanied
this
physical
accident
his
hair
was
still
plentiful
and
white
as
snow
his
dark
eyes
were
undimmed
and
proved
not
only
brilliant
but
wonderfully
keen
he
told
them
more
than
once
and
indeed
proved
that
behind
large
glasses
that
lent
an
expression
to
his
face
his
long
sight
was
unimpaired
his
rather
round
face
sparkled
with
intelligence
and
humor
he
owned
to
eighty
years
yet
presented
an
amazing
vitality
and
a
keen
interest
in
life
and
its
fulness
the
old
man
had
played
the
at
human
existence
and
seemed
to
know
as
much
if
not
more
of
the
game
than
the
players
he
confessed
to
this
attitude
and
blamed
himself
for
it
i
have
never
done
a
stroke
of
honest
work
in
my
life
he
said
i
was
born
with
the
silver
spoon
in
my
mouth
alas
i
have
been
amazingly
lazy
it
was
my
metier
to
look
on
i
ought
at
least
to
have
written
a
book
but
then
all
the
things
i
wanted
to
say
have
been
so
exquisitely
said
by
count
gobineau
in
his
immortal
volumes
that
i
should
only
have
been
an
echo
the
world
is
too
full
of
echoes
as
it
is
believe
me
if
i
had
been
called
to
work
for
my
living
i
should
have
cut
a
respectable
figure
for
i
have
an
excellent
brain
you
know
england
signor
when
i
tell
you
that
i
married
an
and
that
both
my
sons
have
english
blood
in
their
veins
you
will
realize
the
sincerity
of
my
devotion
my
dear
wife
was
a
somerset
mary
may
always
declared
that
the
old
italian
won
her
heart
and
even
awakened
something
akin
to
affection
before
she
had
known
him
half
an
hour
there
was
a
fascination
in
his
admixture
of
childish
simplicity
and
varied
knowledge
none
indeed
could
resist
his
gracious
humor
and
courtesies
the
old
man
could
be
simple
and
ingenuous
too
but
only
when
it
pleased
him
so
to
be
and
it
was
not
the
second
childishness
of
age
for
his
intellect
remained
keen
and
moved
far
more
swiftly
than
any
at
chadlands
but
he
was
modest
and
loved
a
jest
the
hand
of
time
had
indeed
touched
him
and
sometimes
his
memory
broke
down
and
he
faltered
with
a
verbal
difficulty
but
this
only
appeared
to
happen
when
he
was
weary
the
morning
is
my
good
time
he
told
them
you
will
i
fear
find
me
a
stupid
old
fellow
after
dinner
signor
mannetti
proved
a
tremendous
talker
and
implicitly
revealed
that
he
belonged
to
the
nobility
of
his
country
and
that
he
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
many
notable
men
the
subject
of
his
visit
was
not
mentioned
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
he
spoke
only
of
italy
laughed
to
think
he
had
passed
through
florence
to
seek
sir
walter
in
england
and
then
finding
his
hostess
a
neophyte
at
the
shrines
of
art
attuned
himself
to
the
subject
for
her
benefit
if
you
found
pictures
answer
to
an
unknown
need
within
yourself
that
is
very
well
he
declared
about
music
i
know
little
but
concerning
painting
a
great
deal
and
you
desire
to
know
too
i
see
the
spirit
is
willing
but
the
spirit
probably
does
not
know
yet
what
lies
in
front
of
it
you
are
groping
blind
childlike
without
a
hand
to
guard
and
an
authority
to
guide
that
is
merely
to
waste
time
when
you
go
back
to
italy
you
must
begin
at
the
beginning
if
you
are
in
earnest
not
at
the
middle
only
ignorance
measures
art
in
terms
of
skill
for
there
are
no
degrees
in
art
none
has
transcended
giotto
because
technique
and
draughtsmanship
are
accidents
of
time
they
lie
outside
the
soul
of
the
matter
art
is
in
fact
a
static
thing
it
changes
as
the
face
of
the
sea
changes
from
hour
to
hour
but
it
does
not
progress
there
are
great
and
small
artists
and
great
and
small
movements
as
there
are
great
and
small
waves
brisk
breezes
and
terrific
tempests
but
all
are
moulded
of
like
substance
in
the
one
case
art
in
the
other
the
ocean
remains
unchanged
i
shall
plan
your
instruction
for
you
if
you
please
and
send
you
to
the
primitives
first
the
mighty
ones
who
laid
the
foundations
i
lived
five
years
at
siena
for
love
of
the
beginnings
and
you
must
also
learn
to
love
and
reverence
the
beginnings
if
you
would
understand
that
light
in
the
darkness
men
call
the
renaissance
he
broke
from
mary
presently
strove
to
interest
sir
walter
and
succeeded
a
benevolent
autocracy
is
the
ideal
government
my
friend
the
ideal
of
all
supreme
thinkers
a
machiavelli
a
nietzsche
a
stendhal
a
gobineau
liberty
and
equality
are
terms
mutually
destructive
they
can
not
exist
together
for
given
liberty
the
strong
instantly
look
to
it
that
equality
shall
perish
and
rightly
so
equality
is
a
war
cry
for
fools
a
negation
of
nature
an
abortion
the
very
ants
know
better
doubtless
you
view
with
considerable
distrust
the
growing
spirit
of
democracy
or
what
is
called
by
that
name
i
do
admitted
sir
walter
your
monarch
and
mine
are
a
little
bitten
by
this
tarantula
i
am
concerned
for
them
we
must
not
pander
to
the
mob
leaders
for
they
are
not
and
never
have
been
the
thing
itself
they
not
the
mob
are
to
kill
as
you
say
but
that
state
will
soon
perish
that
thinks
to
prosper
under
the
rule
of
the
proletariat
such
a
constitution
would
be
opposed
to
natural
law
and
therefore
contain
the
seeds
of
its
own
dissolution
and
its
death
would
be
inconceivably
horrible
for
the
death
of
huge
coarse
organisms
is
always
horrible
only
distinguished
creatures
are
beautiful
in
death
or
know
how
to
die
like
gentlemen
who
are
on
your
side
signor
asked
henry
lennox
more
than
i
know
i
hope
gobineau
is
my
lighthouse
in
the
storm
you
must
read
him
if
you
have
not
done
so
he
was
the
incarnate
spirit
of
the
renaissance
he
radiated
from
his
bosom
its
effulgence
and
shot
it
forth
like
the
light
of
a
pharos
over
dark
waters
he
best
of
all
men
understood
it
and
most
of
all
men
mourned
to
see
its
bright
hope
and
glory
perish
out
of
the
earth
under
the
unconquerable
superstition
of
mankind
and
the
lamentable
infliction
of
the
jewish
race
alas
the
jews
have
destroyed
many
other
things
besides
the
saviour
of
us
all
they
found
the
renaissance
to
be
the
favorite
theme
of
signor
mannetti
he
returned
again
and
again
to
it
and
it
was
typical
of
him
that
he
could
combine
assurances
of
being
a
devout
catholic
with
sentiments
purely
pagan
christianity
has
operated
in
the
making
of
many
slaves
and
charlatans
he
said
one
mourns
the
fact
but
must
be
honest
it
has
too
often
scourged
the
only
really
precious
members
of
society
from
the
temple
of
life
it
has
cast
the
brave
and
clean
and
virile
into
outer
darkness
and
exalted
the
staple
of
humanity
which
is
never
brave
or
virile
and
seldom
really
clean
a
hideous
wave
submerges
everything
that
matters
the
proud
the
beautiful
the
only
beings
that
justify
the
existence
of
mankind
will
soon
be
on
the
hills
with
the
hawks
and
leopards
and
hunted
like
them
outcast
pariah
unwanted
hated
the
spirit
of
christianity
is
socialistic
i
fear
said
sir
walter
it
is
one
of
those
things
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
but
the
modern
clergy
speak
with
a
clear
voice
on
the
subject
do
your
clergy
indeed
speak
with
a
clear
voice
they
do
and
we
must
of
course
listen
truth
is
apt
to
be
painful
and
how
can
we
reconcile
our
aristocratic
instincts
with
our
faith
i
ask
for
information
and
you
will
forgive
the
personality
i
find
myself
in
almost
entire
agreement
with
your
noble
sentiments
but
as
a
good
christian
ought
i
to
be
so
how
do
you
stand
with
the
one
true
faith
in
your
heart
and
these
opinions
in
your
head
signor
the
old
man
twinkled
and
a
boyish
smile
lighted
his
aged
countenance
a
good
question
a
shrewd
thrust
sir
walter
there
can
be
only
one
answer
to
that
my
friend
with
god
all
things
are
possible
henry
laughed
his
uncle
was
puzzled
you
think
that
is
no
answer
continued
the
italian
but
reason
also
must
have
a
place
in
the
sun
though
we
have
to
hide
it
in
our
pocket
sometimes
so
many
great
men
would
not
extinguish
their
light
and
had
it
extinguished
for
them
a
difficult
subject
let
us
continue
to
think
in
compartments
it
is
safer
so
if
you
are
over
eighty
years
old
you
love
safety
but
i
love
joy
and
romance
also
and
is
not
religion
almost
the
only
joy
and
romance
left
to
us
it
is
affirmation
remember
not
negation
that
makes
the
world
go
round
the
forget
that
and
they
are
sterile
accordingly
signor
mannetti
wits
were
something
too
nimble
for
his
hearers
he
talked
and
talked
about
everything
but
the
matter
in
their
minds
until
ten
when
his
man
came
after
him
thereupon
he
rose
like
an
obedient
child
and
wished
them
stephano
is
my
guardian
angel
he
said
a
being
of
painful
punctuality
but
he
adds
years
to
my
life
he
forgets
nothing
i
wish
you
a
kind
farewell
until
and
offer
grateful
thanks
for
your
welcome
i
breakfast
in
my
room
if
you
please
and
shall
be
ready
at
eleven
to
put
myself
at
your
service
then
you
will
be
so
gracious
as
to
answer
me
some
questions
and
i
shall
please
god
try
to
help
you
chapter
xi
prince
djem
the
master
of
chadlands
was
both
drawn
and
repelled
by
his
guest
signor
mannetti
revealed
a
type
of
mind
entirely
beyond
the
other
experience
and
while
he
often
uttered
sentiments
with
which
sir
walter
found
himself
in
cordial
agreement
he
also
committed
himself
to
a
great
many
opinions
that
surprised
and
occasionally
shocked
the
listener
sir
walter
was
also
conscious
that
many
words
uttered
flew
above
his
understanding
the
old
italian
could
juggle
with
english
almost
as
perfectly
as
he
was
able
to
do
with
his
own
language
he
had
his
country
mastery
of
the
phrase
the
ironies
the
double
meanings
half
malicious
half
humorous
the
outlook
on
humanity
that
delights
to
surprise
the
compliment
that
on
closer
examination
proves
really
to
be
the
reverse
mary
father
voiced
his
emotions
when
the
visitor
had
gone
to
bed
if
it
did
seem
impossible
he
told
henry
i
could
almost
imagine
that
signor
mannetti
was
trying
to
pull
my
leg
sometimes
he
tries
and
succeeds
answered
young
lennox
he
is
built
that
way
his
mind
is
as
agile
as
a
monkey
despite
his
age
he
a
sly
old
bird
his
thoughts
move
a
thousand
times
faster
than
ours
and
they
a
thousand
times
more
subtle
but
he
very
fascinating
declared
mary
he
a
gentleman
answered
henry
an
italian
gentleman
different
from
us
in
their
ideas
of
good
form
that
all
good
form
is
largely
a
matter
of
geography
like
most
other
manners
and
customs
i
believe
in
him
anyway
so
do
i
mary
i
do
think
he
would
ever
have
put
himself
to
such
extraordinary
trouble
if
he
had
felt
pretty
hopeful
but
sir
walter
doubted
he
old
and
his
mind
plays
him
tricks
sometimes
no
doubt
immensely
clever
but
his
cleverness
belongs
to
the
past
he
has
not
moved
with
the
times
any
more
than
i
have
his
eye
flashes
still
and
you
know
he
has
claws
but
like
a
dear
old
persian
cat
he
would
never
dream
of
using
them
i
think
he
would
answered
her
cousin
he
might
spring
on
anybody
from
behind
he
is
at
any
rate
too
old
to
understand
democracy
he
understands
it
only
too
well
replied
sir
walter
like
myself
he
knows
that
democracy
is
only
autocracy
turned
inside
out
human
nature
is
constructed
to
bear
any
such
ideal
it
might
suit
sheep
and
oxen
not
men
he
is
an
aristocrat
a
survival
proud
as
a
peacock
under
his
humility
as
as
you
are
yourself
father
i
rather
doubt
his
kindness
of
heart
said
henry
latins
are
not
kind
but
i
do
doubt
his
cleverness
one
must
be
on
one
guard
against
first
impressions
mary
no
no
one
must
when
they
so
pleasant
there
is
nothing
small
or
peddling
about
him
it
was
angelic
of
such
an
old
man
to
take
so
much
trouble
henry
lennox
reminded
them
of
practical
considerations
the
first
thing
is
to
get
the
room
opened
for
him
he
is
going
to
see
uncle
walter
at
eleven
and
he
want
to
visit
the
grey
room
afterwards
if
we
get
chubb
and
a
man
or
two
from
the
village
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
they
can
help
caunter
to
open
the
room
and
have
it
ready
for
him
after
lunch
sir
walter
rang
and
directed
that
workmen
should
be
sent
for
at
the
earliest
hour
next
day
i
feel
doubtful
as
to
what
the
authorities
would
say
however
he
told
henry
when
his
orders
had
been
taken
what
can
they
say
but
be
well
pleased
if
the
infernal
thing
is
cleared
up
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
so
i
should
think
but
i
share
mary
optimism
i
honestly
believe
that
signor
mannetti
knows
a
great
deal
more
about
the
grey
room
than
he
has
let
us
imagine
how
can
he
possibly
do
that
asked
his
uncle
time
will
show
but
i
going
to
back
him
at
eleven
on
the
following
morning
the
visitor
appeared
he
walked
with
a
ebony
cane
and
dressed
in
a
fashion
of
earlier
days
he
was
alert
and
keen
his
mind
had
no
difficulty
in
concentrating
on
his
subject
it
appeared
that
he
had
all
particulars
at
his
fingers
ends
and
he
went
back
into
the
history
of
the
grey
room
as
far
as
sir
walter
was
able
to
take
him
we
are
dealing
with
five
victims
to
our
certain
knowledge
he
said
for
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
all
must
have
suffered
the
same
death
and
under
the
same
circumstances
four
victims
signor
you
forget
your
aged
relative
the
lady
who
came
to
spend
christmas
with
your
father
when
you
were
a
boy
and
was
found
dead
on
the
floor
colonel
vane
however
recollected
her
because
you
had
mentioned
her
when
telling
the
story
of
forrester
nurse
forrester
i
never
associated
my
aged
aunt
with
subsequent
tragedies
nobody
did
nevertheless
it
was
not
old
age
and
a
good
dinner
that
ended
her
life
she
too
perished
by
an
assassin
you
still
speak
of
crime
if
i
am
not
mistaken
then
is
the
only
word
but
forgive
me
is
it
imaginable
that
the
same
criminal
could
destroy
three
men
last
year
and
kill
an
old
woman
more
than
sixty
years
ago
quite
possible
you
do
not
see
then
i
hope
to
have
the
privilege
of
showing
you
presently
it
would
seem
then
that
the
malignant
thing
is
really
undying
as
poor
may
believed
a
conscious
being
hidden
there
but
beyond
our
sight
and
knowledge
no
no
my
friend
let
me
be
frank
i
have
no
theory
that
embraces
either
a
good
or
evil
spirit
believe
me
there
are
fewer
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy
man
has
burdened
his
brain
with
an
infinite
deal
of
rubbish
of
his
own
manufacture
much
of
his
principle
and
practice
is
built
on
myths
and
dreams
he
is
a
credulous
creature
and
insanely
tenacious
to
tradition
but
i
say
to
you
suspect
tradition
at
every
turn
and
the
more
ancient
the
tradition
the
more
mistrust
it
we
harbor
a
great
deal
too
much
of
the
savage
still
in
us
we
still
carry
about
far
more
of
his
mental
lumber
and
nonsense
than
we
imagine
intellect
should
simplify
rather
than
complicate
and
those
to
come
will
look
back
with
pity
to
see
this
generation
like
flies
entangled
in
the
webs
of
thought
their
rude
forefathers
spun
but
the
eternal
verities
are
few
a
child
could
count
them
we
are
however
a
great
deal
too
fond
of
believing
what
our
ancestors
believed
alas
nobody
sins
more
in
this
respect
than
i
let
us
then
throw
overboard
the
supernatural
once
and
for
all
so
far
as
the
grey
room
is
concerned
no
ghost
haunts
it
no
succubus
or
succuba
is
hidden
there
to
harry
the
life
out
of
good
men
and
women
it
is
strange
that
you
should
take
almost
the
identical
line
of
thought
that
poor
peter
hardcastle
took
i
hope
to
god
you
are
right
so
far
i
am
most
certainly
in
the
right
we
can
leave
the
other
world
out
of
our
calculations
he
asked
various
questions
many
of
which
did
not
appear
to
bear
on
the
subject
but
he
made
no
suggestions
as
yet
and
advanced
no
theories
he
suspected
that
peter
hardcastle
might
have
arrived
at
a
conclusion
had
not
death
cut
short
his
inquiry
from
time
to
time
he
lifted
his
hand
gently
for
silence
and
permitted
a
reply
to
penetrate
his
mind
i
think
very
slowly
about
new
things
now
he
said
an
idea
must
sink
in
gradually
and
find
its
place
that
is
the
worst
of
new
ideas
there
is
so
little
room
for
them
when
you
are
eighty
the
old
and
settled
opinions
fill
the
space
and
are
jealous
and
resent
newcomers
sir
walter
explained
to
him
presently
that
the
room
was
being
opened
and
would
be
ready
after
luncheon
whereupon
he
expressed
concern
for
the
workers
let
them
have
a
care
he
said
for
if
i
am
right
the
danger
is
still
present
let
them
work
with
despatch
and
not
loiter
about
no
harm
has
ever
undertaken
more
than
one
when
in
the
room
alone
the
detectives
saw
and
felt
nothing
nevertheless
the
assassin
was
quite
equal
to
smudging
out
the
detectives
believe
me
sir
walter
the
day
was
fine
and
signor
mannetti
expressed
a
wish
to
take
the
air
they
walked
on
the
terrace
presently
and
mary
joined
them
he
asked
for
her
arm
and
she
gave
it
prince
padded
beside
her
and
the
visitor
declared
interest
in
him
like
myself
your
dog
is
on
the
verge
of
better
things
he
said
he
will
do
good
deeds
in
the
happy
hunting
grounds
be
sure
they
told
him
the
feats
of
prince
and
he
appeared
to
be
interested
nevertheless
the
faithful
creature
ought
to
die
now
he
is
blind
and
paralysis
is
crippling
his
hinder
parts
sir
walter
patted
the
head
of
his
ancient
favorite
he
dies
on
friday
he
said
the
vet
will
come
then
i
assure
you
the
thought
gives
me
very
genuine
pain
he
has
earned
euthanasia
surely
what
is
that
fine
tree
with
great
white
flowers
i
have
seen
the
like
before
but
am
sadly
ignorant
of
horticulture
a
said
mary
it
supposed
to
be
the
finest
in
devonshire
a
beautiful
object
but
all
is
beautiful
here
an
english
spring
can
be
divine
i
shall
ask
you
to
drive
me
to
primroses
presently
those
are
azaleas
that
bank
of
living
fire
superb
he
praised
the
scene
and
spoke
about
the
formal
gardens
of
italy
then
when
luncheon
was
finished
and
he
had
smoked
a
couple
of
cigarettes
signor
mannetti
rose
bowed
to
sir
walter
and
said
now
if
you
please
they
accompanied
and
watched
him
silently
while
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
grey
room
the
place
was
unchanged
and
the
dancing
cherubs
on
the
great
chairs
seemed
to
welcome
daylight
after
their
long
darkness
the
visitor
wandered
slowly
from
end
to
end
of
the
chamber
nodded
to
himself
and
became
animated
then
he
checked
his
gathering
excitement
and
presently
spoke
i
think
i
am
going
to
help
you
sir
walter
he
said
that
is
great
and
good
news
signor
then
the
old
man
became
inconsequent
and
turned
from
the
room
to
the
contents
if
indeed
he
had
found
a
clue
he
appeared
in
no
haste
to
pursue
it
he
entered
now
upon
a
disquisition
concerning
the
furniture
and
they
listened
patiently
for
he
had
showed
that
any
interruption
troubled
him
but
it
seemed
that
he
enjoyed
putting
a
strain
upon
their
impatience
beautiful
pieces
he
said
but
not
spanish
as
you
led
me
to
suppose
spanish
chestnut
wood
but
nothing
else
spanish
about
them
they
are
of
the
italian
renaissance
and
it
is
most
seemly
that
italian
craftsmanship
of
such
high
order
should
repose
here
under
an
italian
ceiling
strange
to
say
my
sleeping
apartment
at
rome
closely
resembles
this
room
i
live
in
a
villa
that
dates
from
the
fifteenth
century
and
belonged
to
the
colonna
my
chests
are
more
superb
than
these
but
your
suite
the
bed
and
chairs
i
confess
are
better
than
mine
there
is
however
a
reason
for
that
let
us
examine
them
for
the
sake
of
may
are
these
carved
chairs
with
their
reliefs
of
dancing
putti
familiar
to
her
the
figures
i
mean
mary
shook
her
head
then
it
is
certain
that
in
your
italian
wanderings
you
did
not
go
to
prato
these
groups
of
children
dancing
and
blowing
horns
are
very
cleverly
copied
from
donatello
famous
pulpit
in
the
duomo
the
design
is
carried
on
from
the
chairs
to
the
footboard
of
the
bed
but
in
their
midst
upon
the
footboard
is
let
in
this
oval
painted
on
wood
it
is
faded
and
the
garlands
have
withered
in
so
many
hundred
years
as
well
they
might
but
i
can
feel
the
dead
color
quite
well
and
i
also
know
who
painted
it
is
it
possible
signor
this
faint
ghost
of
a
picture
there
exists
no
doubt
at
all
you
see
a
little
pinturicchio
note
the
gay
bands
of
variegated
patterns
the
arabesques
and
fruits
their
hues
have
vanished
but
their
forms
and
certain
mannerisms
of
the
master
are
unmistakable
these
dainty
decorations
were
the
sign
manual
of
such
quattrocento
painters
as
gozzoli
and
pinturicchio
and
to
these
men
he
for
whom
these
works
of
art
were
created
assigned
the
painting
and
adornment
of
the
vatican
we
will
come
to
him
directly
it
was
for
michelangelo
to
make
the
creations
of
these
artists
mere
colored
bubbles
and
froth
when
seen
against
the
immensity
and
intellectual
grandeur
of
his
future
masterpieces
in
the
sistine
but
that
was
afterwards
we
are
concerned
with
the
pope
for
whom
these
chairs
and
this
bed
were
made
yes
a
pope
my
friends
no
less
a
personage
than
alexander
he
waited
like
a
skilled
actor
for
the
tremendous
sensation
he
expected
and
deserved
but
it
did
not
come
unhappily
for
signor
mannetti
great
moment
his
words
conveyed
no
particular
impression
to
anybody
sir
walter
asked
politely
and
was
he
a
good
or
a
bad
pope
i
fear
many
of
those
gentlemen
had
little
to
their
credit
but
the
signor
felt
the
failure
of
his
great
climax
at
first
he
regretted
it
and
a
wave
of
annoyance
even
contempt
passed
unseen
through
his
mind
then
he
was
glad
that
the
secret
should
be
hidden
for
another
hours
to
gain
immensely
in
dramatic
sensation
by
delay
already
he
was
planning
the
future
and
designing
wonderful
histrionics
he
could
not
be
positive
that
he
was
right
though
now
the
old
man
felt
very
little
doubt
he
did
not
answer
sir
walter
question
but
asked
one
himself
the
detectives
examined
this
apartment
with
meticulous
care
you
say
they
did
indeed
and
yet
what
can
care
and
zeal
do
what
can
the
most
conscientious
student
achieve
if
his
activities
are
confounded
by
ignorance
the
amazing
thing
to
me
is
that
nobody
should
have
had
the
necessary
information
to
lead
them
at
least
in
the
right
direction
and
yet
i
run
on
too
fast
after
all
who
shall
be
blamed
for
it
is
of
course
the
grey
room
and
nothing
but
the
grey
room
we
are
concerned
with
am
i
right
the
grey
room
has
the
evil
fame
certainly
it
has
and
yet
a
little
knowledge
of
a
few
peculiar
facts
a
pinch
of
history
yet
once
again
who
shall
be
blamed
who
can
be
fairly
asked
to
possess
that
pinch
of
history
which
means
so
much
in
this
room
how
could
history
have
helped
us
signor
asked
henry
lennox
i
shall
tell
you
but
history
is
always
helpful
there
is
history
everywhere
around
us
not
only
here
but
in
every
other
department
of
this
noble
house
take
these
chairs
by
the
accident
of
training
i
read
in
them
a
whole
chapter
of
the
beginnings
of
the
renaissance
to
you
they
are
only
old
furniture
you
thought
them
spanish
because
they
were
bought
in
spain
at
valencia
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
did
not
know
that
sir
walter
but
your
grandfather
purchased
them
there
to
the
despair
and
envy
of
another
collector
yes
these
chairs
have
speaking
faces
to
me
just
as
the
ceiling
over
them
has
a
speaking
face
also
it
too
is
copied
history
in
fact
breathes
its
very
essence
in
this
home
if
i
knew
more
history
than
i
do
then
other
beautiful
things
would
talk
to
me
as
freely
as
these
chairs
and
as
freely
as
the
trophies
of
the
chase
and
the
tiger
skins
below
no
doubt
talk
to
sir
walter
but
are
we
not
all
historical
men
women
even
children
to
exist
is
to
take
your
place
in
history
though
as
in
my
case
the
fact
will
not
be
recorded
save
in
the
of
the
everlasting
yes
i
am
ancient
history
now
and
go
far
back
before
italy
was
a
united
kingdom
much
entertaining
information
will
be
lost
for
ever
when
i
die
believe
me
while
the
new
generation
is
crying
forth
the
new
knowledge
and
glorying
in
its
genius
we
of
the
old
guard
are
sinking
into
our
graves
and
taking
the
old
knowledge
with
us
yet
they
only
rediscover
for
themselves
what
we
know
human
life
is
the
snake
with
its
tail
in
its
mouth
nietzsche
eternal
recurrence
and
the
commonplaces
of
our
forefathers
are
echoed
on
the
lips
of
our
children
as
great
discoveries
henry
lennox
ventured
to
bring
him
back
to
the
point
what
knowledge
what
particular
branch
of
information
should
a
man
possess
signor
to
find
out
what
you
have
found
merely
an
adornment
my
young
friend
a
side
branch
of
withered
learning
not
cultivated
i
fear
by
your
scotland
yard
yet
i
have
known
country
gentlemen
to
be
skilled
in
it
the
practice
of
heraldry
i
marked
your
arms
on
your
italian
gates
i
must
look
at
those
gates
again
they
are
not
very
good
i
fear
but
the
arms
a
chevron
between
three
lions
a
fine
coat
yet
probably
not
so
ancient
as
the
gates
it
was
such
a
thing
as
bothered
me
in
florence
said
sir
walter
seen
it
before
somewhere
but
where
i
know
not
a
bull
head
of
gold
on
a
red
field
signor
mannetti
started
and
laughed
we
will
come
to
the
golden
bull
presently
sir
walter
you
shall
meet
him
i
promise
you
then
he
broke
off
and
patted
his
forehead
but
i
go
too
quickly
far
too
quickly
indeed
i
must
rest
my
poor
brain
now
or
it
will
rattle
in
my
head
like
a
dry
walnut
when
it
begins
to
rattle
i
know
that
i
have
done
enough
for
the
present
may
i
walk
in
the
garden
again
not
alone
but
with
your
companionship
of
course
unless
you
would
like
to
retire
and
rest
for
a
while
presently
i
shall
do
so
and
please
permit
nobody
to
enter
the
grey
room
but
myself
not
a
soul
must
go
or
come
without
me
sir
walter
spoke
you
still
believe
the
peril
is
material
then
an
active
physical
thing
controlled
by
a
conscious
human
intelligence
if
i
am
right
it
certainly
is
active
enough
they
went
into
the
garden
and
signor
mannetti
finding
a
snug
seat
in
the
sun
decided
to
stop
there
henry
and
his
uncle
exchanged
glances
and
the
latter
found
his
faith
weakening
for
the
italian
mind
appeared
to
wander
he
became
more
and
more
irrelevant
as
it
seemed
he
spoke
again
of
the
old
dog
who
was
at
his
master
feet
euthanasia
for
the
aged
why
not
for
that
matter
i
have
considered
it
for
myself
in
dark
moments
have
you
ever
wondered
why
we
destroy
our
pets
for
love
of
them
yet
suffer
our
fellow
creatures
to
exist
and
endure
to
the
very
dregs
nature
most
fiendish
methods
of
dissolution
again
one
of
those
terrible
problems
where
mercy
and
religion
can
not
see
eye
to
eye
they
uttered
appropriate
sentiments
and
again
the
old
man
changed
the
subject
and
broke
new
ground
there
was
a
prince
not
your
old
dog
but
a
royal
lad
of
the
east
prince
djem
the
brother
of
the
sultan
bajazet
do
you
know
that
story
possibly
not
it
is
unimportant
enough
and
to
this
day
the
sequel
of
the
incident
is
buried
in
a
mystery
as
profound
as
that
of
the
grey
room
our
later
historians
whitewash
alexander
vi
concerning
the
matter
of
prince
djem
but
then
it
is
so
much
the
habit
of
later
historians
to
whitewash
everybody
a
noble
quality
in
human
nature
perhaps
to
try
and
see
the
best
even
while
one
can
only
do
so
by
ignoring
the
worst
certainly
as
your
poet
says
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
or
at
any
rate
softer
there
is
a
tendency
to
side
with
the
angels
where
we
are
dealing
with
historic
dead
nero
caligula
calvin
alva
napoleon
torquemada
all
these
monsters
and
portents
and
a
thousand
such
figures
are
growing
whiter
as
they
grow
fainter
they
will
have
wings
and
haloes
presently
yet
not
for
me
i
am
a
good
hater
my
friends
but
prince
djem
i
wander
so
you
should
be
more
severe
with
me
and
keep
me
to
my
point
sultan
bajazet
wanted
his
younger
brother
out
of
the
way
and
he
paid
the
papacy
forty
thousand
ducats
a
year
to
keep
the
young
fellow
a
prisoner
in
italy
it
was
a
gilded
captivity
and
doubtless
the
dissolute
oriental
enjoyed
himself
quite
as
well
at
rome
as
he
would
have
done
in
constantinople
but
after
alexander
had
achieved
the
triple
tiara
bajazet
refused
to
pay
his
forty
thousand
ducats
any
longer
the
pope
therefore
wrote
strongly
to
the
sultan
telling
him
that
the
king
of
france
designed
to
seize
prince
djem
and
go
to
war
on
his
account
against
the
turks
this
does
not
weary
you
no
indeed
declared
mary
alexander
added
that
to
enable
him
to
resist
the
french
and
spare
bajazet
realms
the
threatened
invasion
a
sum
of
forty
thousand
ducats
must
be
immediately
forthcoming
the
sultan
doubtless
appalled
by
such
a
threat
despatched
the
money
with
a
private
letter
he
was
as
great
a
diplomat
as
the
pope
himself
and
saw
a
way
to
evade
this
gigantic
annual
impost
by
compounding
on
the
death
of
djem
unfortunately
for
him
however
both
the
papal
envoy
and
bajazet
own
messenger
were
captured
upon
their
return
journey
by
the
brother
of
cardinal
della
rovere
alexander
bitterest
enemy
thus
the
contents
of
the
secret
letter
became
known
and
the
christian
world
heard
with
horror
how
bajazet
had
offered
the
occupant
of
peter
throne
three
hundred
thousand
ducats
to
assassinate
prince
djem
time
passed
and
the
pope
triumphed
over
his
enemies
he
prepared
to
abandon
the
person
of
the
young
turk
to
charles
of
france
and
effectively
checkmated
the
formidable
rovere
for
a
season
but
then
as
we
know
prince
djem
suddenly
perished
and
while
latest
writers
declare
that
he
actually
reached
france
only
to
die
there
ruined
by
his
own
debaucheries
i
for
one
have
not
accepted
that
story
he
never
reached
france
my
friends
for
be
sure
alexander
vi
was
not
the
man
to
let
any
human
life
stand
between
his
treasury
and
three
hundred
thousand
ducats
signor
mannetti
preserved
silence
for
a
time
then
he
returned
in
very
surprising
fashion
to
the
subject
that
had
brought
him
to
chadlands
he
had
been
reflecting
and
now
proceeded
with
his
thoughts
aloud
you
must
however
restrain
your
natural
impatience
a
little
longer
until
another
night
has
passed
i
will
if
you
please
myself
spend
some
hours
in
the
grey
room
after
dark
and
learn
what
the
medieval
spirits
have
to
tell
me
shall
i
see
the
wraith
of
prince
djem
think
you
or
the
ghost
of
pinturicchio
hovering
round
his
little
picture
or
those
bygone
cunning
workers
in
plaster
who
built
the
ceiling
they
will
at
least
talk
the
language
of
tuscany
and
i
shall
be
at
home
among
them
sir
walter
protested
that
indeed
is
the
last
thing
i
could
permit
signor
he
said
that
is
the
first
thing
that
must
happen
nevertheless
replied
the
old
gentleman
calmly
you
need
not
fear
for
me
sir
walter
i
jest
about
the
spirits
there
are
no
spirits
in
the
grey
room
or
if
there
are
they
are
not
such
as
can
quarrel
with
you
or
me
there
is
however
something
much
worse
than
any
spirit
lurking
in
the
heart
of
your
house
a
potent
sleepless
fiendish
thing
and
far
from
wondering
at
all
that
has
happened
i
only
marvel
that
worse
did
not
befall
but
i
have
the
magic
talisman
the
sesame
i
am
safe
enough
even
if
i
am
mistaken
though
my
fires
are
burning
low
it
will
take
more
than
your
grey
room
to
extinguish
them
i
hold
the
clue
of
the
labyrinth
and
shall
pass
safely
in
and
out
again
i
can
tell
you
if
i
am
right
i
confess
that
any
such
plan
is
most
disagreeable
to
me
i
have
been
specially
directed
by
the
authorities
to
allow
no
man
to
make
further
experiments
alone
vergilio
mannetti
showed
a
trace
of
testiness
forgive
me
but
your
mind
moves
without
its
usual
agility
my
friend
have
i
not
told
you
everything
what
matters
scotland
yard
seeing
that
it
is
entirely
in
the
dark
while
i
have
the
light
let
them
hear
that
they
are
bats
and
owls
and
that
one
old
man
has
outwitted
the
pack
of
them
you
have
as
you
say
told
us
much
my
dear
signor
and
much
that
you
have
said
is
deeply
interesting
in
your
mind
it
may
be
that
these
various
facts
are
related
and
bring
you
to
some
sort
of
conclusion
bearing
on
the
grey
room
but
for
us
it
is
not
so
these
statements
leave
us
where
they
find
us
they
hang
on
nothing
not
even
upon
one
another
in
our
ears
i
speak
plainly
since
this
is
a
matter
for
plain
speaking
it
is
natural
that
you
should
not
feel
as
we
feel
but
i
need
not
remind
you
that
what
to
you
is
merely
an
extraordinary
mystery
to
us
is
much
more
you
have
imagination
however
far
more
than
i
have
and
can
guess
without
being
told
the
awful
suffering
the
past
has
brought
to
my
daughter
and
myself
our
slow
english
brains
can
not
flash
our
thoughts
along
so
quickly
as
yours
signor
said
mary
it
is
stupid
of
us
but
i
stand
corrected
answered
the
other
instantly
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
bowed
to
them
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
i
am
a
withered
old
fool
and
not
quick
at
all
forgive
me
but
thus
it
stands
since
you
did
not
guess
through
pardonable
ignorance
of
a
certain
fact
then
for
the
pleasure
of
absolute
proof
i
withhold
my
discovery
a
little
longer
there
is
drama
here
but
we
must
be
skilled
dramatists
and
not
spoil
our
climax
or
anticipate
it
it
shall
be
perhaps
even
you
are
not
going
to
be
kept
long
in
suspense
nor
will
i
go
alone
and
disobey
scotland
yard
your
aged
pet
this
spaniel
dog
shall
join
me
good
prince
and
i
will
retire
early
and
if
you
so
desire
it
we
shall
be
very
willing
to
welcome
you
in
the
grey
room
say
some
six
or
seven
hours
later
i
do
not
sleep
there
but
merely
sustain
a
vigil
as
all
the
others
did
but
it
will
be
briefer
than
theirs
you
will
oblige
me
mary
spoke
seeing
the
pain
on
her
father
face
she
felt
certain
that
the
old
man
knew
perfectly
what
he
was
talking
about
she
had
spoken
aside
to
henry
and
he
agreed
with
her
mannetti
had
solved
the
mystery
he
had
even
enabled
them
to
solve
it
but
now
perhaps
to
punish
them
for
their
stupidity
he
was
deliberately
withholding
the
key
half
from
love
of
effect
half
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
he
was
planning
something
theatrical
he
saw
himself
at
the
centre
of
the
stage
in
this
tragic
drama
and
it
was
not
unnatural
that
he
should
desire
to
figure
there
effectively
after
taking
so
much
trouble
thus
while
sir
walter
still
opposed
he
was
surprised
to
hear
mary
plead
on
the
visitor
behalf
and
his
nephew
support
her
signor
mannetti
is
quite
right
father
i
am
positive
of
it
she
said
he
is
right
and
because
he
is
right
he
is
safe
admirably
put
cried
the
italian
there
you
have
the
situation
in
a
nutshell
my
friends
trust
a
clever
woman
intuition
i
am
indeed
right
never
was
consciousness
of
right
so
impressed
upon
my
mind
prone
as
i
am
always
to
doubt
my
own
conclusions
i
am
in
fact
right
because
i
can
not
be
wrong
trust
me
my
own
safety
is
absolutely
assured
for
we
are
concerned
with
the
operations
of
men
like
ourselves
at
least
i
hope
very
different
from
ourselves
but
men
nevertheless
it
was
your
fate
to
revive
this
horror
it
shall
be
my
privilege
to
banish
it
out
of
the
earth
at
a
breath
the
cunning
of
the
ungodly
shall
be
brought
to
nought
and
not
before
it
is
time
but
the
mills
of
god
grind
slowly
our
achievement
will
certainly
resound
to
the
corners
of
the
civilized
world
i
as
positive
as
the
signor
himself
that
he
is
safe
uncle
said
henry
lennox
let
us
go
to
tea
replied
sir
walter
these
things
are
far
too
deep
for
a
plain
man
i
only
ask
you
to
consider
all
this
must
mean
to
me
who
am
the
master
of
chadlands
and
responsible
to
the
authorities
reflect
if
ill
overtook
you
it
is
impossible
that
it
can
so
others
believed
and
where
are
they
further
trouble
would
unhinge
my
mind
signor
you
have
endured
enough
to
make
you
speak
so
strongly
and
your
brave
girl
also
but
fear
nothing
whatever
i
am
far
too
deeply
concerned
and
committed
on
your
behalf
to
add
a
drop
to
the
bitter
drink
of
the
past
my
dear
sir
walter
i
am
as
safe
in
that
room
as
i
should
be
at
the
altar
steps
of
peter
trust
old
prince
if
you
can
not
trust
me
i
rely
largely
on
your
blind
pet
to
aid
me
he
has
good
work
to
do
yet
faithful
fellow
the
detectives
took
animals
into
the
room
but
they
were
not
hurt
said
lennox
neither
shall
the
dog
be
hurt
he
patted
the
sleeping
spaniel
and
they
rose
and
went
into
the
house
together
mannetti
evidently
assumed
that
his
wishes
were
to
be
granted
i
will
go
and
sleep
awhile
he
said
until
an
early
dinner
excuse
me
and
let
may
and
lennox
convince
you
as
they
are
themselves
convinced
these
events
have
immensely
excited
my
vitality
i
little
guessed
that
at
the
end
of
my
days
a
sensation
so
remarkable
lay
in
store
for
me
i
must
conserve
my
strength
for
i
am
well
very
well
and
supported
by
the
consciousness
of
coming
triumph
such
an
achievement
would
have
rewarded
my
long
journey
and
these
exertions
even
had
not
your
acquaintance
been
ample
reward
already
i
will
then
sleep
until
and
so
be
replenished
to
play
my
part
in
a
wonderful
though
melancholy
romance
let
us
dine
at
seven
if
you
please
his
excitement
and
natural
levity
strove
with
the
gloomy
facts
he
resembled
a
mourner
at
a
funeral
who
experiences
pleasant
rather
than
painful
emotions
but
continually
reminds
himself
to
behave
in
a
manner
appropriate
to
the
occasion
they
sent
for
his
man
and
on
stephano
arm
the
old
gentleman
withdrew
he
returned
for
a
moment
however
and
spoke
again
you
will
do
exactly
as
i
wish
and
allow
no
human
being
to
enter
the
grey
room
keep
the
key
in
your
pocket
sir
walter
and
do
not
go
there
yourself
either
it
is
still
a
trap
of
death
for
everybody
else
in
the
world
but
myself
chapter
xii
the
golden
bull
when
masters
came
to
clear
the
tea
he
found
sir
walter
still
unconvinced
what
do
you
think
of
signor
mannetti
masters
asked
henry
and
the
butler
who
was
a
great
reader
of
the
newspapers
made
answer
i
think
he
a
bit
of
a
freak
henry
they
tell
me
that
old
people
can
have
a
slice
of
monkey
slipped
into
nowadays
to
keep
going
and
make
young
and
lively
again
well
i
should
say
the
gentleman
had
a
whole
monkey
popped
in
somewhere
i
never
see
such
another
got
a
tongue
like
a
and
he
leaves
you
guessing
every
time
he
amazing
clever
so
his
man
that
stephano
knows
a
thing
or
two
he
got
round
jane
bond
something
disgraceful
i
never
knew
what
was
in
jane
and
her
five
and
fifty
if
she
an
hour
would
he
be
safe
in
the
grey
room
said
sir
walter
he
be
safe
anywhere
the
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
our
safe
and
a
few
other
things
i
catched
him
poking
about
in
the
silver
table
only
this
morning
he
knows
what
what
he
knows
everything
i
would
say
he
ai
one
of
the
swell
mob
myself
made
up
to
look
like
an
old
man
i
swear
he
never
seen
eighty
years
for
all
he
pretends
henry
laughed
do
you
be
frightened
of
him
masters
he
all
right
let
him
go
in
the
grey
room
by
all
means
henry
he
knows
safe
anywhere
yes
sir
walter
he
knows
he
safe
enough
he
got
the
measure
of
it
prince
is
to
go
with
him
masters
prince
why
we
do
know
he
wishes
it
he
ca
hurt
poor
old
prince
anyway
well
i
sleep
no
worse
and
i
hope
none
of
you
wo
if
excuse
me
come
what
will
there
nothing
in
the
grey
room
will
catch
that
man
napping
not
that
i
against
the
gentleman
in
general
you
understand
only
i
would
trust
him
a
foot
he
and
no
more
a
foreigner
than
i
am
else
he
could
talk
so
fine
english
as
i
do
if
not
finer
masters
is
on
our
side
father
said
mary
and
he
right
the
signor
is
he
loves
to
be
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
all
old
people
do
and
one
of
the
pathetic
things
in
life
is
that
they
seldom
allowed
to
be
so
he
making
the
most
of
his
opportunity
and
if
you
refuse
uncle
walter
he
only
go
away
and
say
he
can
not
help
you
and
accuse
us
of
giving
him
all
this
trouble
for
nothing
added
henry
lennox
they
had
their
wish
at
last
and
when
signor
mannetti
came
down
to
an
early
dinner
in
splendid
spirits
sir
walter
conceded
his
desire
good
my
friend
and
do
not
fear
that
a
night
of
anxiety
awaits
you
indeed
if
i
am
not
mistaken
it
will
be
possible
for
us
all
to
sleep
very
soundly
though
we
may
go
to
bed
rather
late
but
i
think
we
must
be
prepared
not
to
retire
till
after
two
i
will
enter
upon
my
watch
at
eight
in
half
an
hour
the
door
shall
be
left
open
as
you
wish
but
i
beg
that
none
will
approach
the
east
end
of
the
corridor
that
is
only
fair
i
will
however
permit
lennox
to
station
himself
on
the
top
of
the
great
staircase
and
from
time
to
time
he
may
challenge
me
he
shall
say
all
well
and
be
sure
i
shall
answer
is
well
could
anything
be
more
satisfactory
signor
mannetti
ate
sparingly
then
he
donned
a
big
fur
and
declared
himself
ready
they
thought
he
had
forgotten
prince
but
he
insisted
upon
the
company
of
the
ancient
spaniel
the
dog
had
fed
and
he
could
sleep
as
well
in
one
place
as
another
fear
not
said
the
italian
i
shall
be
considerate
to
your
ancient
pet
i
do
not
beg
his
aid
without
reason
he
is
on
my
side
and
will
help
me
if
he
can
infirm
though
he
be
i
have
made
friends
with
him
set
him
at
my
feet
i
will
sit
here
under
the
electric
light
and
read
my
italian
papers
thus
once
again
a
solitary
occupied
the
grey
room
and
measured
his
intelligence
against
the
terrible
forces
therein
concealed
signor
mannetti
took
leave
of
them
cheerfully
at
eight
and
while
sir
walter
and
mary
descended
to
the
library
henry
took
up
his
station
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
the
corridor
was
lighted
and
the
door
of
the
grey
room
left
open
but
in
ten
minutes
the
watcher
looked
out
and
cried
to
lennox
who
sat
smoking
about
yards
from
him
there
is
a
great
draught
here
he
said
i
will
close
the
door
but
leave
it
ajar
that
we
may
salute
each
other
from
time
to
time
the
hours
crept
on
and
since
everybody
at
chadlands
knew
what
was
happening
few
retired
to
rest
it
was
understood
that
some
time
after
midnight
signor
mannetti
hoped
to
declare
the
result
of
his
experiment
henry
lennox
challenged
always
receiving
a
brisk
reply
but
a
little
after
one
his
all
well
signor
received
no
response
he
raised
his
voice
but
still
no
answer
came
he
went
to
the
door
therefore
and
looked
into
the
grey
room
the
watcher
had
slipped
down
in
the
armchair
they
had
set
for
him
under
the
electric
light
and
was
lying
motionless
but
in
an
easy
position
he
still
wore
his
prince
henry
did
not
see
the
room
was
silent
and
cold
the
electric
light
burned
brightly
and
both
windows
were
open
young
lennox
hastened
downstairs
his
thoughts
concentrated
on
his
uncle
and
his
desire
was
to
spare
him
any
needless
shock
for
a
moment
he
believed
that
signor
mannetti
had
succumbed
in
the
grey
room
as
others
before
him
but
he
could
not
be
certain
a
bare
had
elapsed
since
the
watcher
had
uttered
a
cheerful
answer
to
the
last
summons
and
told
them
his
vigil
was
nearly
ended
lennox
sought
masters
therefore
told
him
that
the
worst
was
to
be
feared
yet
explained
that
the
old
man
who
had
watched
in
the
grey
room
might
not
be
dead
but
sunk
in
sleep
masters
was
sanguine
that
it
might
be
so
be
sure
he
is
so
i
fetch
the
liqueur
brandy
and
armed
with
his
panacea
he
followed
henry
upstairs
signor
mannetti
had
not
moved
but
as
they
approached
him
to
their
infinite
relief
he
did
so
opened
his
eyes
stared
wildly
about
him
and
then
realized
the
situation
alas
now
i
have
frightened
you
out
of
your
senses
he
said
looking
at
their
anxious
faces
all
is
well
in
less
than
another
hour
i
should
have
summoned
sir
walter
but
just
that
last
overcame
me
and
i
sank
into
sleep
what
is
the
time
a
quarter
to
two
signor
good
then
let
your
uncle
be
summoned
i
have
found
out
the
secret
a
thimbleful
of
old
cognac
signor
asked
masters
willingly
my
friend
willingly
i
see
how
wise
you
both
were
i
approve
and
thank
you
you
thought
that
i
had
followed
the
others
into
the
shades
yet
meant
to
restore
me
if
you
could
without
frightening
sir
walter
to
go
to
sleep
was
unpardonable
abraham
masters
and
henry
descended
with
the
good
news
while
the
old
man
drank
i
shall
detain
you
half
an
hour
or
so
he
said
when
they
all
returned
to
him
but
i
have
no
fear
that
anybody
will
want
to
fall
asleep
sir
walter
spoke
thank
heaven
signor
thank
heaven
all
is
well
with
you
all
is
absolutely
well
with
me
but
then
i
have
slept
refreshingly
for
some
time
you
i
fear
have
not
closed
your
eyes
would
you
have
any
objection
to
masters
hearing
what
you
may
have
to
tell
us
by
so
doing
a
true
and
ungarbled
report
will
get
out
to
chadlands
my
report
will
go
out
to
the
whole
world
sir
walter
all
is
accomplished
and
established
on
certain
proofs
your
good
spaniel
has
played
his
part
also
i
salute
him
the
old
prince
henry
now
observed
that
the
dog
was
stretched
on
the
floor
at
signor
mannetti
feet
still
asleep
mary
knelt
to
pat
the
spaniel
and
started
back
how
horribly
cold
he
is
for
ever
asleep
a
martyr
to
science
he
was
to
die
on
friday
remember
he
has
received
euthanasia
a
little
sooner
and
nothing
in
his
life
has
become
him
like
the
leaving
of
it
the
last
victim
of
the
grey
room
mourn
him
not
he
passed
without
a
pang
as
did
his
betters
but
but
you
spoke
of
crime
and
criminals
gasped
sir
walter
and
truly
great
crimes
have
been
committed
in
this
room
and
great
criminals
committed
them
is
a
crime
any
less
a
crime
because
the
doers
have
mouldered
in
their
dishonored
graves
for
nearly
five
hundred
years
your
handling
of
speech
is
not
ours
and
you
use
words
differently
the
old
dog
did
not
suffer
you
say
how
did
he
come
to
die
in
his
sleep
even
so
without
a
sigh
the
last
venerable
victim
of
this
murdering
shadow
you
saw
him
die
and
yet
were
safe
yourself
sir
asked
lennox
that
is
what
happened
now
sit
down
all
of
you
father
abraham
also
and
in
five
minutes
all
will
be
as
clear
as
day
they
obeyed
him
silently
yes
a
master
criminal
one
whose
name
has
rung
down
the
ages
and
will
from
win
a
further
resonance
would
that
we
could
bring
him
to
account
but
he
has
already
gone
to
it
if
justice
lies
at
the
root
of
things
as
all
men
pray
and
you
and
i
believe
sir
walter
an
interesting
reflection
how
many
suffer
if
they
do
not
actually
perish
from
the
sins
of
the
dead
not
only
the
sins
of
our
father
are
visited
upon
us
but
if
we
could
trace
the
infliction
the
crimes
of
countless
dead
men
accomplished
long
before
we
were
born
into
this
suffering
world
i
speak
in
a
parable
but
this
is
literal
actual
dead
men
committed
these
murders
and
left
this
legacy
of
woe
signor
mannetti
stroked
the
lifeless
spaniel
when
we
were
left
alone
i
picked
him
up
and
set
him
on
the
bed
he
did
not
waken
and
i
knew
that
he
would
never
waken
again
now
let
us
look
at
this
noble
bed
if
you
please
here
is
the
link
you
see
without
which
so
much
that
i
told
you
yesterday
must
have
sounded
no
more
than
the
idle
chatter
of
an
old
man
come
and
use
your
eyes
ah
if
only
people
had
used
their
eyes
sooner
they
followed
him
and
he
pointed
to
a
framework
of
carved
wood
that
connected
the
four
posts
what
is
this
on
the
frieze
running
above
the
capitals
of
the
little
ionic
pillars
the
papal
crown
and
keys
said
mary
good
now
regard
the
other
side
a
coat
of
arms
a
golden
bull
on
a
red
ground
why
father
that
was
what
puzzled
you
at
florence
surely
it
was
the
thing
stuck
in
my
memory
yet
i
could
not
remember
where
i
had
seen
it
before
signor
mannetti
prepared
for
his
effect
then
made
it
the
arms
of
the
borgia
the
arms
of
the
spanish
pope
alexander
vi
of
unholy
memory
so
all
is
told
and
we
will
soon
go
to
bed
having
marked
them
this
morning
you
will
see
how
readily
i
was
led
into
the
heart
of
the
secret
it
only
needed
some
such
certain
sign
and
everything
that
had
happened
was
consonant
with
this
explanation
the
first
to
suffer
puzzled
me
but
i
solved
that
problem
too
you
shall
hear
how
each
woman
and
each
man
was
slain
look
at
this
mattress
upholstered
in
satin
there
lies
the
unsleeping
thing
that
brings
sleep
so
quickly
to
others
i
guessed
it
this
morning
i
proved
it
at
seventeen
minutes
past
eight
prince
was
dead
but
not
until
i
awoke
near
two
did
i
dare
approach
him
for
how
did
he
die
the
moment
the
heat
of
his
ancient
body
penetrated
the
mattress
under
him
it
released
its
awful
venom
he
stretched
himself
curled
up
again
and
as
the
exhalation
rose
with
scarcely
a
tremor
he
passed
from
sleep
into
death
needless
to
tell
you
that
i
kept
far
from
him
for
i
guessed
that
not
until
the
poor
fellow
was
cold
would
the
demon
in
the
mattress
sink
down
and
disappear
as
the
effret
into
his
bottle
then
mattress
and
dog
were
alike
harmless
as
they
are
now
i
gave
him
only
five
hours
for
he
was
a
small
thin
beast
and
the
heat
soon
left
his
body
but
signor
i
shall
anticipate
all
your
objections
if
you
will
listen
a
little
longer
dear
may
let
us
sit
again
and
question
me
after
i
have
spoken
if
any
doubts
remain
unanswered
another
liqueur
masters
he
sipped
and
preserved
silence
for
a
few
moments
while
none
spoke
then
from
his
armchair
he
traversed
the
story
of
the
grey
room
and
proved
amazingly
familiar
with
the
smallest
detail
of
it
indeed
when
at
last
he
had
finished
none
could
find
any
questions
to
ask
there
are
two
very
interesting
preliminary
facts
to
note
my
friends
began
the
signor
he
beamed
upon
them
and
enjoyed
his
own
exposition
with
unconcealed
gusto
the
first
is
that
a
room
already
suffering
from
sinister
traditions
and
held
to
be
haunted
should
have
been
precisely
that
into
which
this
infernal
engine
of
destruction
was
introduced
yet
what
more
natural
you
have
the
furniture
and
for
the
time
being
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
the
house
is
already
full
of
beautiful
things
and
these
surplus
treasures
you
store
here
to
be
safe
and
out
of
the
way
in
a
room
which
is
not
put
to
its
proper
use
you
are
not
collectors
or
experts
sir
walter
father
did
not
share
his
enthusiasm
neither
did
sir
walter
care
for
old
furniture
so
the
pieces
take
their
place
in
this
room
and
are
more
or
less
forgotten
that
is
the
first
interesting
fact
and
the
second
seems
to
me
to
be
this
that
those
who
perished
here
in
living
memory
all
died
at
different
places
in
the
room
and
so
died
that
their
deaths
could
not
be
immediately
and
undeviatingly
traced
to
the
bed
hardcastle
for
example
as
you
have
related
his
conversation
did
not
associate
the
death
of
poor
captain
may
with
that
of
the
lady
of
the
hospital
eleven
years
before
and
sir
walter
himself
saw
no
reason
to
connect
the
still
earlier
death
of
his
aged
aunt
which
took
place
when
he
was
a
boy
with
the
disaster
that
followed
let
us
now
examine
for
a
moment
the
amazing
fact
that
none
of
the
stigmata
of
death
was
found
in
those
who
perished
here
death
has
three
modes
the
pale
horseman
strikes
us
down
by
asphyxia
by
coma
and
by
syncope
in
asphyxia
he
stabs
the
lungs
in
coma
his
lance
is
aimed
at
the
brain
in
syncope
at
the
heart
when
a
man
dies
by
asphyxia
it
means
that
the
action
of
the
muscles
by
which
he
breathes
is
stopped
or
the
work
of
his
lungs
prevented
by
injury
or
the
free
passage
of
air
arrested
as
in
drowning
or
strangulation
it
may
also
mean
that
embolism
has
taken
place
and
the
pulmonary
artery
is
blocked
withholding
blood
from
the
lungs
but
it
was
not
thus
that
any
died
in
this
chamber
coma
occurs
through
an
apoplexy
or
concussion
by
the
use
of
certain
narcotic
or
mineral
poisons
and
in
various
other
ways
all
of
which
are
ruled
out
for
us
there
remains
syncope
a
heart
ceases
to
beat
from
haemorrhage
or
starvation
from
exhaustion
or
the
depressing
influence
of
certain
drugs
they
who
died
here
died
from
syncope
but
why
no
autopsy
can
tell
us
why
they
passed
with
only
their
maker
to
sustain
them
and
none
leaves
behind
an
explanation
of
what
overtook
him
or
her
yet
we
know
full
well
even
in
the
case
of
peter
hardcastle
concerning
whom
the
police
felt
doubt
that
he
was
quite
dead
before
lennox
discovered
him
and
picked
him
up
we
know
that
the
phenomena
of
rigor
mortis
had
already
set
in
before
his
body
reached
london
nothing
however
is
new
under
the
sun
many
journals
related
the
fact
that
these
people
had
passed
away
without
a
cause
as
though
it
were
an
event
without
a
parallel
it
is
not
your
templeman
in
describes
two
examples
of
sudden
death
with
absolute
absence
of
any
pathological
condition
in
any
part
of
the
bodies
to
account
for
it
he
describes
the
case
of
a
man
of
and
calls
it
inhibition
of
the
heart
the
heart
was
arrested
in
diastole
instead
of
systole
as
is
usually
the
case
the
mode
of
death
was
syncope
the
cause
of
death
undiscoverable
a
layman
may
be
permitted
i
suppose
to
describe
inhibition
of
the
heart
as
but
we
know
in
our
cases
that
if
a
shock
it
was
not
a
painful
one
perhaps
not
even
an
unpleasant
one
since
all
other
emotions
can
be
pleasant
or
unpleasant
why
must
we
assume
that
the
supreme
emotion
of
death
may
not
be
pleasant
also
did
we
know
how
to
make
it
so
perhaps
the
borgia
among
their
secrets
had
discovered
this
at
least
the
familiar
signs
of
death
were
wholly
absent
from
the
countenances
of
the
dead
the
jaws
were
not
set
the
familiar
expressions
were
not
changed
as
usually
happens
from
rigidity
of
facial
muscles
their
faces
were
not
sallow
their
temples
were
not
sunk
their
brows
were
not
contracted
we
will
now
take
the
victims
one
by
one
and
show
how
death
happened
to
each
of
them
yet
left
no
sign
that
it
had
happened
frankly
the
first
case
alone
presented
any
difficulties
to
me
for
a
time
i
despaired
of
proving
how
the
bed
had
destroyed
sir
walter
ancestor
because
she
had
not
entered
it
but
the
difficulty
becomes
clear
to
one
possessing
our
present
knowledge
for
once
prove
the
properties
of
the
bed
and
the
rest
follows
you
will
say
that
they
were
not
proved
only
guessed
that
was
true
until
prince
died
his
death
crowned
my
edifice
of
theory
and
converted
it
to
fact
as
to
why
the
bed
has
these
properties
that
is
for
science
to
find
out
presently
to
return
then
to
the
old
lady
the
ancient
woman
of
your
race
who
came
unexpectedly
to
the
christmas
and
was
put
to
sleep
in
the
grey
room
at
her
own
wish
she
was
found
dead
next
morning
on
the
floor
she
had
not
entered
the
bed
the
exact
facts
have
long
disappeared
from
human
knowledge
and
it
is
only
possible
to
them
by
inference
and
the
support
of
those
straightforward
events
that
followed
i
conceive
then
that
though
the
old
lady
did
not
create
the
warmth
that
liberated
the
evil
spirit
of
the
bed
and
so
destroyed
her
that
warmth
was
nevertheless
artificially
created
what
must
have
happened
think
you
the
bed
is
made
up
in
haste
and
the
fire
lighted
but
the
fire
is
a
long
way
from
the
bed
and
would
have
no
effect
to
create
the
necessary
temperature
there
is
however
a
bottle
in
the
bed
or
a
hot
brick
wrapped
in
flannel
the
old
lady
is
about
to
enter
her
bed
she
has
extinguished
her
candle
but
the
flame
of
the
fire
gives
light
she
has
prayed
she
throws
off
her
and
flings
back
the
covering
of
the
bed
to
fall
an
instant
victim
to
the
miasma
she
drops
backward
and
is
found
dead
next
morning
by
which
time
the
bottle
and
bed
are
also
cold
taken
alone
i
grant
this
explanation
may
fail
to
win
your
sympathy
but
consider
the
cumulative
evidence
in
store
the
old
lady
may
of
course
have
died
a
natural
death
she
may
not
have
turned
down
the
bed
there
is
nobody
living
to
tell
us
all
that
sir
walter
can
recollect
is
that
she
was
found
on
the
floor
of
the
room
dead
exactly
where
he
does
not
remember
but
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
her
death
took
place
in
that
way
we
are
on
safer
ground
with
the
other
tragic
happenings
though
save
in
the
case
of
nurse
forrester
there
is
nothing
on
the
surface
of
events
to
connect
their
deaths
with
the
accursed
bed
you
will
see
however
that
it
is
very
easy
to
do
so
in
the
lady
case
all
is
clear
enough
she
goes
to
bed
tired
and
she
sleeps
peacefully
into
death
without
waking
she
is
probably
asleep
within
ten
minutes
before
her
own
warmth
has
penetrated
through
sheet
and
blanket
to
the
mattress
beneath
and
so
destroyed
her
suppose
that
she
is
dead
in
half
an
hour
she
retired
to
rest
at
ten
she
is
called
at
seven
the
room
is
presently
broken
into
and
she
is
then
not
only
dead
but
cold
the
demon
has
gone
to
sleep
again
under
its
lifeless
burden
now
had
she
been
stout
and
well
covered
there
had
hardly
been
time
for
her
to
grow
cold
and
those
who
came
to
her
assistance
might
even
have
perished
too
but
she
is
a
little
thin
thing
and
the
heat
has
gone
out
of
her
this
assured
the
safety
of
those
who
came
to
the
bedside
one
can
make
no
laws
as
to
the
time
necessary
for
a
dead
body
to
grow
as
cold
as
its
surroundings
the
bodies
of
the
old
and
the
young
cool
more
quickly
than
those
of
adult
persons
if
the
conditions
are
favorable
a
body
may
cool
in
six
to
eight
hours
prince
took
but
five
poor
little
bag
of
bones
in
the
case
of
captain
may
the
conditions
are
altogether
different
let
me
speak
with
all
tenderness
and
spare
you
pain
be
sure
that
he
suffered
no
more
than
the
others
the
bed
is
now
no
longer
made
the
mattress
is
bare
that
matters
not
to
him
clad
in
his
pyjamas
with
a
railway
rug
to
cover
him
and
his
for
a
pillow
he
flings
himself
down
and
from
his
powerful
and
sanguine
frame
warmth
is
instantly
communicated
to
the
mattress
that
supports
him
probably
but
a
few
minutes
were
sufficient
to
liberate
the
poison
he
is
not
asleep
but
on
the
edge
of
sleep
when
he
becomes
suddenly
conscious
of
physical
sensations
beyond
his
experience
he
had
breathed
death
but
yet
he
is
not
dead
his
brain
works
and
can
send
a
message
to
his
limbs
which
are
still
able
to
obey
but
his
hour
has
come
he
leaps
from
the
bed
in
no
suffering
but
conscious
perhaps
of
an
oppression
or
an
unfamiliar
odor
we
can
not
say
what
we
only
know
that
he
feels
intense
surprise
not
pain
for
in
that
dying
moment
his
emotions
are
fixed
for
ever
by
the
muscles
of
his
face
he
needs
air
and
seeks
it
he
hurries
to
the
recess
kneels
on
the
cushion
and
throws
open
the
window
or
the
window
may
have
been
already
open
we
can
not
tell
to
reach
it
is
his
last
conscious
act
and
in
another
moment
he
is
dead
the
bed
is
not
suspected
why
should
it
be
who
could
prove
that
he
had
even
laid
down
upon
it
indeed
it
was
believed
and
reported
at
the
inquest
that
he
had
not
done
so
yet
that
is
what
unquestionably
happened
otherwise
his
candle
would
have
burned
to
the
socket
he
had
blown
it
out
and
settled
to
rest
be
sure
we
have
now
to
deal
with
the
detective
and
here
again
there
was
nothing
to
associate
his
death
with
the
bed
of
the
borgia
yet
you
will
see
without
my
aid
how
easily
he
came
by
his
death
peter
hardcastle
desires
to
be
alone
that
he
may
study
the
grey
room
and
everything
in
it
he
is
left
as
he
wishes
walks
here
and
there
sketches
a
ground
plan
of
the
room
and
exhausts
its
more
obvious
peculiarities
would
that
he
had
known
the
meaning
of
the
golden
bull
presently
he
strikes
a
train
of
thought
and
sits
down
to
develop
it
or
he
may
not
have
finished
with
the
room
and
have
taken
a
seat
from
which
he
could
survey
everything
around
him
he
sits
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
there
on
the
right
side
he
makes
his
notes
then
his
last
thoughts
enter
his
mind
abstract
reflection
on
the
subject
of
his
trade
for
a
moment
he
forgets
the
matter
immediately
in
hand
and
writes
his
ideas
in
his
book
he
has
been
sitting
on
the
bed
now
for
some
while
how
long
we
know
not
but
long
enough
to
create
the
heightened
temperature
which
is
all
the
watchful
fiend
within
the
mattress
requires
to
summon
him
then
ascends
the
spirit
of
death
and
hardcastle
surprised
as
captain
may
was
surprised
leaps
to
his
feet
he
takes
two
or
three
steps
forward
his
book
and
pen
fall
from
his
hand
and
he
drops
upon
his
face
a
dead
man
he
is
of
course
still
warm
when
lennox
finds
him
but
the
bed
he
leaped
from
is
cold
again
and
harmless
its
work
done
there
remains
the
priest
the
rev
septimus
may
he
neither
lay
on
the
bed
nor
sat
upon
it
but
what
did
he
do
he
clearly
knelt
beside
it
a
long
time
engaged
in
prayer
nothing
more
natural
than
that
he
should
stretch
his
arms
over
the
mattress
bury
his
face
in
his
hands
and
so
remain
in
commune
with
the
almighty
uttering
petition
after
petition
for
the
being
he
conceived
as
existing
in
the
grey
room
without
power
to
escape
from
it
thus
leaning
upon
the
bed
with
his
arms
stretched
upon
it
and
his
head
perhaps
sunk
between
them
he
presently
creates
that
heightened
temperature
sufficient
to
arouse
the
destroyer
it
enters
into
him
how
we
know
not
yet
and
he
sinks
unconscious
to
the
floor
while
the
bed
is
quickly
cold
again
as
to
the
four
detectives
inspector
frith
and
his
men
pure
chance
saved
the
life
of
at
least
one
of
them
and
by
so
doing
chance
also
prevented
them
from
discovering
that
the
bed
in
their
midst
was
the
seat
of
all
the
trouble
had
one
among
them
taken
up
his
watch
upon
it
he
would
certainly
have
died
in
the
presence
of
his
collaborators
but
the
men
sat
on
chairs
in
the
corners
of
the
room
and
the
chairs
were
harmless
whether
their
gas
masks
would
indeed
have
saved
them
remains
of
course
to
be
proved
i
doubt
it
such
my
friends
were
the
masterpieces
of
the
borgia
for
whom
the
profoundest
chemists
worked
willingly
enough
and
by
doing
so
doubtless
made
their
fortunes
their
poisons
were
so
designed
to
act
that
by
their
very
operation
the
secrets
of
them
were
concealed
and
all
clues
obliterated
chemistry
knows
nothing
of
the
supernatural
yet
can
as
in
this
case
achieve
results
that
may
well
appear
to
be
black
magic
and
if
we
of
this
day
fail
to
find
them
out
it
is
easy
to
guess
that
in
their
own
times
much
that
they
caused
to
be
done
was
set
down
to
the
operations
of
heaven
alone
science
will
be
deeply
interested
in
your
borgia
mattress
sir
walter
science
i
doubt
not
will
carefully
unpick
it
and
make
a
series
of
very
remarkable
experiments
yet
i
make
bold
to
believe
that
science
may
be
baffled
by
the
cunning
and
forgotten
knowledge
of
men
long
dust
we
shall
see
as
to
that
he
rose
and
bade
masters
call
stephano
then
with
a
few
words
they
parted
and
each
shook
the
old
man
hand
and
expressed
a
deep
and
genuine
gratitude
before
they
did
so
a
little
remains
to
add
said
signor
mannetti
you
shall
hear
what
it
is
for
the
moment
it
has
been
a
crowning
joy
to
my
long
life
that
i
was
able
to
do
this
service
to
new
and
valued
friends
in
the
servants
hall
next
morning
masters
related
what
he
had
heard
and
if
you
ask
me
he
concluded
i
draw
back
what
i
thought
about
him
being
younger
than
he
pretends
he
older
old
as
the
hills
older
than
that
horror
in
the
grey
boom
he
a
demon
and
he
killed
the
old
dog
and
i
believe
he
a
borge
himself
if
the
truth
was
known
chapter
xiii
two
notes
they
walked
in
the
garden
next
morning
and
sir
walter
delayed
to
write
to
scotland
yard
until
after
seeing
signor
mannetti
again
the
old
gentleman
descended
to
them
presently
and
declared
himself
i
must
sit
in
the
sun
and
go
to
sleep
again
after
lunch
he
said
stephano
is
annoyed
with
me
and
hints
at
the
doctor
mannering
will
be
here
to
lunch
you
will
understand
that
nobody
is
more
deeply
interested
in
these
things
than
he
but
yourself
said
mary
come
and
sit
down
and
rest
you
are
looking
very
tired
a
little
reaction
no
more
it
was
worth
it
he
then
proceeded
where
he
had
broken
off
on
the
preceding
night
there
remains
only
to
tell
you
how
i
found
myself
caught
up
in
your
sad
story
it
had
not
occurred
to
you
to
wonder
i
confess
i
had
never
thought
of
that
signor
you
made
us
forget
such
a
trifling
detail
but
none
the
less
you
will
want
to
know
sir
walter
our
common
friend
colonel
vane
put
the
first
thought
in
my
head
he
laid
the
train
to
which
i
set
the
match
so
well
he
it
was
who
described
the
grey
room
very
exactly
and
the
moment
that
i
heard
of
the
ancient
carved
furniture
i
knew
that
he
spoke
of
curios
concerning
which
i
already
had
heard
the
name
of
lennox
completed
the
clue
for
that
had
already
stirred
memories
in
my
ancient
mind
i
had
listened
to
my
father
when
i
was
young
telling
a
story
in
which
a
bed
and
chairs
and
a
gentleman
named
lennox
were
connected
he
spoke
of
an
ancient
italian
suite
of
three
pieces
the
work
of
craftsmen
at
rome
in
the
fifteenth
century
it
was
papal
furniture
of
the
early
renaissance
well
known
to
him
as
being
in
a
spanish
collection
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
that
is
now
and
when
these
things
came
into
the
market
he
rejoiced
and
hurried
off
to
valencia
where
it
was
to
be
sold
for
he
was
even
such
a
man
as
your
grandfather
a
connoisseur
and
an
enthusiastic
collector
but
alas
his
hopes
were
he
found
himself
in
opposition
to
a
deeper
purse
than
his
own
and
it
was
sir
john
lennox
not
my
father
who
secured
the
bed
and
the
two
chairs
that
go
with
it
these
things
as
i
tell
you
returned
to
my
recollection
and
remembering
them
i
guessed
myself
upon
the
right
track
the
arms
of
the
borgia
and
the
successful
experiment
with
the
dog
prince
proved
that
i
was
correct
in
guessing
where
the
poison
lay
hidden
it
is
impossible
to
express
my
sense
of
your
amazing
goodness
or
my
gratitude
or
my
admiration
for
your
genius
declared
sir
walter
but
the
other
contradicted
him
genius
is
a
great
word
to
which
i
can
lay
no
claim
i
have
done
nothing
at
all
that
you
yourself
might
not
have
done
given
the
same
knowledge
as
for
gratitude
if
indeed
that
is
not
too
strong
an
expression
also
you
can
show
gratitude
in
a
very
simple
manner
dear
friend
i
am
a
practical
old
man
and
to
be
honest
i
very
greatly
covet
the
borgia
bed
and
chairs
now
if
indeed
you
feel
that
i
am
not
asking
too
grand
a
favor
a
favor
out
of
all
keeping
with
my
good
offices
on
your
behalf
then
let
me
purchase
the
bed
and
chairs
and
convey
them
with
me
home
to
rome
it
is
seemly
that
they
should
return
to
rome
is
it
not
rome
would
welcome
them
i
much
desire
to
sleep
in
that
bed
to
be
where
i
am
so
sure
prince
djem
lay
when
he
breathed
his
last
yes
believe
me
he
received
your
bed
as
a
gracious
present
from
alexander
vi
the
borgia
were
generous
of
such
gifts
the
bed
and
chairs
are
yours
my
dear
signor
and
the
rest
of
the
contents
of
the
grey
room
also
if
you
esteem
them
in
any
way
positively
i
could
not
sir
walter
indeed
you
shall
it
is
done
and
leaves
me
greatly
your
debtor
still
then
be
it
so
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
nor
will
i
say
that
you
oppress
me
with
such
extraordinary
generosity
for
is
it
not
more
blessed
to
give
than
receive
heavens
knows
what
dark
evils
the
bed
may
have
committed
in
the
course
of
its
career
but
its
activities
are
at
an
end
for
me
it
shall
bring
no
more
than
honest
slumber
but
the
mattress
no
i
do
not
want
the
mattress
that
will
be
a
nice
present
for
the
museum
of
your
royal
college
of
surgeons
a
week
later
the
old
man
was
sufficiently
rested
and
he
returned
home
taking
his
treasures
with
him
but
he
did
not
depart
until
he
had
won
a
promise
that
sir
walter
and
mary
would
visit
him
at
rome
within
the
year
experts
again
descended
upon
chadlands
packed
the
source
of
tribulation
with
exceeding
care
and
conveyed
it
to
london
for
examination
those
destined
to
make
the
inquiry
were
much
alive
to
their
perils
and
took
no
risk
six
weeks
later
letters
passed
between
england
and
rome
and
sir
walter
wrote
to
signor
mannetti
sending
such
details
as
he
was
able
to
furnish
a
thin
supple
wire
was
found
to
run
between
the
harmless
flock
of
the
mattress
and
the
satin
casing
wrote
sir
walter
experiments
showed
that
neither
the
stuffing
nor
the
outer
case
contained
any
harmful
substance
but
the
wire
of
which
fifty
miles
wound
over
the
upper
and
lower
surfaces
of
the
mattress
under
its
satin
upholstery
proved
infinitely
sensitive
to
heat
and
gave
off
or
ejected
at
tremendous
speed
an
invisible
highly
poisonous
matter
even
at
a
lower
temperature
than
that
of
a
normal
human
being
insects
placed
upon
it
perished
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
and
it
destroyed
microscopic
life
and
fish
and
frogs
in
water
at
comparatively
low
temperatures
that
caused
the
living
organisms
no
inconvenience
until
portions
of
the
wire
were
introduced
a
cat
died
in
eight
minutes
a
monkey
in
ten
no
pain
or
discomfort
marked
the
operation
of
the
wire
on
unconscious
creatures
they
sank
into
death
as
into
sudden
sleep
and
examination
revealed
no
physical
effects
whatever
the
wire
is
an
alloy
and
the
constituent
metals
have
not
yet
been
determined
but
it
is
not
an
amalgam
for
mercury
is
absent
the
wire
contains
thallium
and
helium
as
the
spectroscope
shows
but
its
awful
radioactivity
and
deadly
emanation
has
yet
to
be
explained
the
chemical
experts
have
a
startling
theory
they
suspect
there
is
a
new
element
here
probably
destined
to
occupy
one
of
the
last
unfilled
places
of
the
periodic
table
which
chronicles
all
the
elements
known
to
science
chemical
analysis
fails
to
reach
the
properties
and
for
their
examination
the
electroscope
and
spinthariscope
are
needful
with
these
the
are
at
work
the
wire
melted
at
a
lower
temperature
than
lead
but
melting
did
not
destroy
its
potency
after
cooling
the
metal
retained
its
properties
and
was
still
responsive
as
before
to
warmth
but
experiment
shows
that
in
a
molten
state
the
metal
of
the
wire
increases
in
effect
and
any
living
thing
brought
within
a
yard
of
it
under
this
condition
succumbs
instantly
its
properties
can
not
be
extracted
so
far
from
the
actual
composition
of
the
wire
they
prove
also
that
the
emanation
from
the
warmed
wire
is
exceedingly
subtle
tenuous
and
volatile
save
under
conditions
of
it
only
operates
at
two
feet
and
a
few
inches
and
the
wire
naturally
grows
cold
very
quickly
it
is
almost
as
light
as
aluminium
a
gas
mask
does
not
arrest
the
poison
indeed
it
evidently
enters
a
body
through
the
nearest
point
offered
to
it
and
a
safe
shield
has
not
yet
been
discovered
i
shall
tell
you
more
when
we
know
more
concluded
sir
walter
but
at
present
it
looks
as
though
your
prophecy
were
correct
and
that
science
is
not
going
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
horrible
secret
easily
mannering
says
that
the
properties
of
the
elements
have
yet
to
be
fully
determined
while
the
subject
of
alloys
was
never
suspected
of
containing
such
secrets
as
may
prove
to
be
the
case
if
more
there
is
to
learn
you
shall
learn
it
in
his
reply
signor
mannetti
declared
that
the
borgia
bed
continued
to
be
a
source
of
extreme
satisfaction
and
comfort
to
him
as
yet
no
vision
has
broken
my
slumbers
but
i
continue
to
hope
that
the
oriental
features
of
sultan
bajazet
brother
may
presently
revisit
the
place
of
his
taking
off
and
that
prince
djem
will
some
night
afford
me
the
pleasure
of
a
conversation
how
much
might
we
tell
each
other
that
neither
of
us
knows
as
to
the
wire
my
friend
i
will
explain
to
you
how
that
was
probably
created
and
right
or
wrong
there
is
nobody
on
this
earth
at
present
who
can
prove
my
theory
to
be
mistaken
be
sure
that
a
medieval
alchemist
searching
in
vain
for
elixir
vitae
or
the
stone
chanced
upon
this
infernal
synthesis
and
fusion
for
him
no
doubt
it
proved
a
philosopher
stone
in
earnest
for
the
borgia
always
extended
a
generous
hand
to
those
who
could
assist
their
damnable
activities
transmutation
so
a
skilled
friend
assures
me
is
now
proved
to
be
a
fact
and
another
generation
will
be
able
perhaps
to
make
gold
if
the
desire
for
that
accursed
mineral
continues
much
longer
to
dominate
mankind
farewell
for
the
present
again
to
see
you
and
your
daughter
is
one
of
those
pleasures
lying
in
wait
for
me
to
make
next
winter
a
season
of
gladness
rather
than
dismay
but
do
not
change
your
minds
one
must
keep
faith
with
a
man
of
eighty
or
risk
the
possibilities
of
remorse
