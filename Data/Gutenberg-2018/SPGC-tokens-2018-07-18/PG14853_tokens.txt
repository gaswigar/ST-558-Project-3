i
the

mystery
david
hume
reginald
brett
twisted
round
in
his
to
permit
the
light
to
fall
clearly
on
the
card
handed
to
him
by
his
what
does
david
hume
look
like
smith
he
asked
a
gentleman
sir
servants
never
make
a
mistake
when
they
give
such
a
description
of
a
visitor
brett
was
satisfied
produce
him
then
he
examined
the
card
it
is
odd
he
thought
david
hume
gives
no
address
and
writes
his
own
cards
i
like
his
signature
too
now
i
wonder
the
door
was
thrown
open
a
tall
young
man
entered
he
was
soberly
attired
in
blue
serge
his
face
and
hands
bore
the
impress
of
travel
and
exposure
his
expression
was
pleasing
and
attractive
in
repose
his
features
were
regular
and
marked
with
lines
of
thought
a
short
beard
of
the
type
affected
by
some
naval
men
gave
him
a
somewhat
unusual
appearance
otherwise
he
carried
himself
like
a
british
cavalry
officer
in
mufti
he
advanced
into
the
room
and
bowed
easily
brett
who
had
risen
instantly
felt
that
his
visitor
was
one
of
those
people
who
erect
invisible
barriers
between
themselves
and
strangers
my
errand
will
occupy
some
time
perhaps
half
an
hour
to
permit
of
full
explanation
said
hume
may
i
ask
i
am
completely
at
your
service
take
that
chair
you
will
find
it
comfortable
do
you
smoke
yes
well
try
those
cigarettes
they
are
better
than
they
look
hume
seemed
to
be
gratified
by
this
cordial
reception
he
seated
himself
as
requested
in
the
best
light
obtainable
in
a
victoria
street
flat
and
picked
up
the
box
of
cigarettes
turkish
he
announced
yes
grown
on
a
slope
near
salonica
indeed
you
interest
me
oh
i
know
them
well
i
was
there
two
months
ago
i
suppose
you
got
these
as
a
present
from
yildiz
kiosk
hume
you
asked
for
half
an
hour
make
it
an
hour
you
have
touched
upon
a
subject
dear
to
my
heart
they
are
the
best
cigarettes
in
the
world
no
one
can
buy
them
they
are
made
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
sultan
household
to
attempt
to
export
them
means
the
bastinado
and
banishment
at
the
least
i
do
not
credit
you
with
employing
agents
on
such
terms
so
i
assume
an
imperial
gift
the
barrister
had
been
looking
intently
at
the
other
man
during
this
short
colloquy
suddenly
his
eyes
sparkled
he
struck
a
match
and
held
it
to
his
visitor
with
the
words
you
are
quite
right
david
the
person
thus
addressed
neither
started
nor
sprang
to
his
feet
nor
gasped
in
amazement
he
took
the
match
lit
a
cigarette
and
said
so
you
know
me
yes
it
is
strange
i
have
never
previously
met
you
to
my
knowledge
am
i
still
a
celebrity
to
me
yes
a
sort
of
distinguished
criminal
eh
no
man
could
be
such
a
judge
of
tobacco
and
remain
commonplace
my
honour
brett
i
think
you
deserve
your
reputation
for
the
first
time
during
eighteen
months
i
feel
hopeful
do
you
know
i
passed
dozens
of
acquaintances
in
the
streets
yesterday
and
none
of
them
knew
me
yet
you
pick
me
out
at
the
first
glance
so
to
speak
they
might
do
the
same
if
you
spoke
to
them
hume
if
you
please
certainly
why
have
you
dropped
part
of
your
surname
it
is
a
long
story
my
lawyers
flint
sharp
of
gray
inn
heard
of
your
achievements
in
the
cases
of
lady
lyle
and
the
imperial
diamonds
they
persuaded
me
to
come
to
you
though
personally
you
have
little
faith
in
me
heaven
knows
brett
i
have
had
good
cause
to
lose
faith
my
case
defies
analysis
it
savours
of
the
supernatural
the
barrister
shoved
his
chair
sideways
until
he
was
able
to
reach
a
bookcase
from
which
he
took
a
bulky
interleaved
volume
supernatural
he
repeated
that
is
new
to
me
as
i
remember
the
affair
it
was
highly
sensational
perplexing
a
blend
of
romance
and
japanese
knives
but
i
do
not
remember
any
abnormal
element
save
one
utter
absence
of
motive
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
possess
a
record
of
the
facts
inquired
hume
exhibiting
some
tokens
of
excitement
in
face
and
voice
as
he
watched
brett
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
in
which
newspaper
cuttings
were
neatly
pasted
some
being
freely
annotated
yes
the
daily
press
supplies
my
demands
in
the
way
of
fiction
a
word
by
the
way
often
misapplied
where
do
you
find
stranger
tales
than
in
the
records
of
life
ah
here
we
are
he
searched
through
a
large
number
of
printed
extracts
there
were
comments
long
reports
and
not
a
few
notes
all
under
the
heading
the
stowmarket
mystery
hume
was
now
deeply
agitated
he
evidently
restrained
his
feelings
by
sheer
force
of
will
brett
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
a
little
surely
you
could
not
have
expected
my
presence
here
this
morning
i
no
more
expected
you
than
the
man
in
the
moon
was
the
reply
but
i
recognised
you
at
once
i
watched
your
face
for
many
hours
whilst
you
stood
in
the
dock
professional
business
took
me
to
the
assizes
during
your
second
trial
at
one
time
i
thought
of
offering
my
services
to
me
no
not
to
you
to
whom
then
to
the
police
winter
the
scotland
yard
man
who
had
charge
of
the
business
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
what
restrained
you
pity
and
perhaps
doubt
i
could
see
no
reason
why
you
should
kill
your
cousin
but
you
believed
me
guilty
the
barrister
looked
his
questioner
straight
in
the
eyes
he
saw
there
the
glistening
terror
of
a
tortured
soul
somehow
he
expected
to
find
a
different
expression
he
was
puzzled
why
have
you
come
here
mr
hume
he
abruptly
demanded
to
implore
your
assistance
they
tell
me
you
are
the
one
man
in
the
world
able
to
clear
my
name
from
the
stain
of
crime
will
you
do
it
again
their
eyes
met
hume
was
fighting
now
fighting
for
all
that
a
man
holds
dear
he
did
not
plead
he
only
demanded
his
rights
born
a
few
centuries
earlier
he
would
have
enforced
them
with
cold
steel
come
brett
he
almost
shouted
if
you
are
as
good
a
judge
of
men
as
you
say
i
am
of
tobacco
you
will
not
think
that
the
cowardly
murderer
who
struck
down
my
cousin
would
come
to
you
of
all
others
and
reopen
the
story
of
a
crime
closed
unwillingly
by
the
law
brett
could
on
occasion
exhibit
an
obstinate
determination
not
to
be
drawn
into
expressing
an
opinion
his
visitor
masterful
manner
annoyed
him
hume
metaphorically
speaking
took
him
by
the
throat
and
compelled
his
services
he
rebelled
against
this
species
of
compulsion
but
mere
politeness
required
some
display
of
courteous
tolerance
it
seems
to
me
he
said
that
we
are
beginning
at
the
end
i
may
not
be
able
to
help
you
what
are
the
facts
the
stranger
was
so
agitated
that
he
could
not
reply
men
are
not
ready
with
language
their
thoughts
may
be
fiery
as
bottled
vitriol
but
they
keep
the
cork
in
the
barrister
allowed
for
this
drawback
his
sympathies
were
aroused
and
they
overcame
his
slight
resentment
try
another
cigarette
he
said
i
have
here
a
summary
of
the
evidence
i
will
read
it
to
you
do
not
interrupt
follow
the
details
closely
and
correct
anything
that
is
wrong
when
i
have
ended
hume
was
still
volcanic
but
he
took
the
proffered
box
ah
cried
brett
though
you
are
angry
your
judgment
is
sound
now
listen
then
he
read
the
following
statement
prepared
by
himself
in
an
idle
moment
the
stowmarket
mystery
is
a
strange
mixture
of
the
real
and
the
unreal
sir
alan
fourth
baronet
met
his
death
on
the
his
horse
blundered
at
a
brook
and
the
rider
was
impaled
on
a
hidden
stake
placed
in
the
stream
by
his
own
orders
to
prevent
poachers
from
netting
trout
his
wife
n√©e
somers
a
bristol
family
had
him
there
were
two
children
a
daughter
margaret
aged
and
a
son
alan
aged
by
his
will
sir
alan
left
all
his
real
and
personal
estate
to
his
son
with
a
life
charge
of
per
annum
for
the
daughter
as
he
was
a
very
wealthy
man
almost
a
millionaire
the
provision
for
his
daughter
was
niggardly
which
might
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
girl
several
years
before
her
father
death
quarrelled
with
him
and
left
home
residing
in
london
and
in
florence
both
children
by
the
way
were
born
in
italy
where
sir
alan
met
and
married
miss
somers
the
old
gentleman
it
appeared
allowed
miss
per
annum
during
his
life
his
son
voluntarily
continued
this
allowance
but
the
brother
and
sister
continued
to
live
apart
he
devoted
to
travel
and
sport
she
to
music
and
art
with
a
leaning
towards
the
occult
a
woman
divorced
from
conventionality
and
filled
with
a
hatred
of
restraint
beechcroft
the
family
residence
is
situated
four
miles
from
stowmarket
close
to
the
small
village
of
sleagill
after
his
father
death
the
young
sir
alan
went
for
a
protracted
tour
round
the
world
meanwhile
his
first
cousin
david
lived
at
beechcroft
during
the
shooting
season
and
incidentally
fell
in
love
with
miss
helen
layton
daughter
of
the
rector
of
sleagill
the
rev
wilberforce
layton
hume
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
and
the
barrister
paused
expecting
him
to
say
something
but
the
other
only
gasped
brokenly
go
on
go
on
love
lasts
longer
than
death
or
crime
mused
brett
he
continued
in
eighteen
months
sir
alan
the
fifth
all
heirs
had
same
name
returned
to
beechcroft
about
christmas
his
cousin
had
been
called
away
on
family
business
but
returned
for
a
new
year
eve
ball
given
by
eastham
a
lady
of
some
local
importance
sir
alan
and
helen
layton
had
followed
the
hounds
together
three
times
during
christmas
week
they
were
of
course
old
friends
david
sent
from
scotland
his
father
estate
was
situated
close
to
inverness
some
presents
to
his
future
wife
his
cousin
and
others
the
gift
to
sir
alan
was
noteworthy
and
fatalistic
a
handsomely
inlaid
japanese
sword
with
a
small
dagger
inserted
in
a
sheath
near
the
top
of
the
scabbard
david
reached
beechcroft
on
the
day
of
the
ball
relations
between
the
cousins
seemed
to
the
servants
to
be
cool
though
the
coolness
lay
rather
with
the
baronet
and
david
a
year
older
it
may
be
here
stated
was
evidently
taken
by
surprise
by
sir
alan
attitude
the
three
young
people
went
to
the
ball
and
shortly
after
midnight
there
was
something
in
the
nature
of
a
scene
sir
alan
had
been
dancing
with
miss
layton
they
were
in
the
conservatory
when
the
young
lady
burst
into
tears
hurried
to
find
david
and
asked
him
to
take
her
at
once
to
her
carriage
eastham
was
acting
as
chaperon
to
the
girl
and
some
heated
words
passed
between
her
and
the
two
young
men
evidence
showed
that
sir
alan
had
bitterly
upbraided
miss
layton
on
account
of
her
engagement
and
hinted
that
david
had
taken
an
unfair
advantage
of
his
alan
absence
to
win
her
affections
this
was
absolutely
untrue
it
was
denied
by
the
two
most
concerned
and
by
eastham
who
as
a
privileged
friend
knew
all
the
facts
the
young
men
were
in
a
state
of
white
heat
but
david
sensibly
withdrew
and
walked
to
the
hall
eastham
house
was
close
to
the
lodge
gates
and
from
the
lodge
a
straight
drive
led
to
the
library
windows
the
main
entrance
being
at
the
side
of
the
house
in
the
library
a
footman
on
duty
in
the
room
maintained
a
good
fire
and
the
french
windows
were
left
unfastened
as
the
young
gentlemen
would
probably
enter
the
house
that
way
david
did
in
fact
do
so
the
footman
quitted
the
room
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
butler
appeared
he
was
an
old
favourite
of
david
he
asked
if
he
should
send
some
whisky
and
soda
the
young
man
agreed
adding
alan
and
i
have
commenced
the
year
badly
ferguson
we
quarrelled
over
a
silly
mistake
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
sleep
on
it
so
i
will
await
his
arrival
let
me
know
if
he
comes
in
the
other
way
the
butler
hoped
that
the
matter
was
not
a
serious
one
other
circumstances
it
might
be
was
the
answer
as
things
are
it
is
simply
a
wretched
mistake
which
a
little
reasonable
discussion
will
put
right
the
footman
brought
the
whisky
and
soda
twenty
minutes
later
he
the
room
to
attend
to
the
fire
david
was
curled
up
in
an
asleep
or
rather
dozing
for
he
stirred
a
little
when
the
man
put
some
coal
in
the
grate
this
was
at
exactly
at
the
butler
thought
he
heard
his
master
voice
coming
from
the
front
of
the
house
and
angrily
protesting
something
unfortunately
he
could
not
catch
a
single
word
he
imagined
that
the
spoken
of
by
david
had
been
renewed
he
waited
two
minutes
not
more
but
hearing
no
further
sounds
he
walked
round
to
the
library
windows
thinking
that
perhaps
he
would
see
sir
alan
in
the
room
to
his
dismay
he
found
his
young
master
stretched
on
the
turf
at
the
side
of
the
drive
thirty
feet
from
the
house
he
rushed
into
the
library
where
david
was
still
asleep
and
moving
uneasily
muttering
the
man
thought
quickly
sir
he
cried
fear
something
has
happened
to
sir
alan
he
is
lying
on
the
ground
outside
the
house
and
i
can
not
arouse
him
then
david
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shouted
god
it
was
not
a
dream
he
is
murdered
unquestionably
but
the
barrister
synopsis
of
a
thrilling
crime
proved
to
be
too
much
for
his
hearer
nerves
hume
stood
up
the
man
was
a
born
fighter
he
could
take
his
punishment
but
only
on
his
feet
again
he
cried
in
anguish
no
it
was
no
dream
but
a
foul
murder
and
they
blame
me
chapter
ii
david
hume
story
brett
closed
the
book
with
a
snap
what
good
purpose
can
it
serve
at
this
time
to
reopen
the
miserable
story
he
asked
curiously
enough
hume
paid
no
heed
to
the
question
his
lips
quivered
his
nostrils
twitched
and
his
eyes
shot
strange
gleams
he
caught
the
back
of
his
chair
with
both
hands
in
a
grasp
that
tried
to
squeeze
the
tough
oak
what
else
have
you
written
there
he
said
and
brett
could
not
help
but
admire
his
forced
composure
nothing
of
any
material
importance
you
were
arrested
after
an
interval
of
some
days
as
the
result
of
a
coroner
warrant
you
explained
that
you
had
a
vivid
dream
in
which
you
saw
your
cousin
stabbed
by
a
stranger
whom
you
did
not
know
whose
face
even
you
never
saw
sir
alan
was
undoubtedly
murdered
the
attachment
to
your
japanese
sword
had
been
driven
into
his
breast
up
to
the
hilt
actually
splitting
his
heart
to
deliver
such
a
blow
with
such
a
weapon
required
uncommon
strength
and
skill
i
think
i
describe
it
here
as
brett
referred
to
his
in
spite
of
himself
he
felt
all
his
old
interest
reawakening
in
this
remarkable
crime
yes
queried
hume
the
barrister
his
lips
pursed
up
and
critical
surveyed
his
concluding
notes
you
were
tried
at
the
ensuing
assizes
and
the
jury
disagreed
your
second
trial
resulted
in
an
acquittal
though
the
public
attitude
towards
you
was
dubious
the
judge
in
summing
up
said
that
the
evidence
against
you
be
deemed
insufficient
in
these
words
he
conveyed
the
popular
opinion
i
see
i
have
noted
here
that
miss
margaret
was
at
a
covent
garden
fancy
dress
ball
on
the
night
of
the
murder
but
the
tragic
deaths
of
her
father
and
brother
had
a
marked
influence
on
the
young
lady
she
of
course
succeeded
to
the
estates
and
decided
at
once
to
live
at
beechcroft
does
she
still
live
there
yes
i
am
told
she
is
distinguished
for
her
charity
and
good
works
she
is
married
ah
to
whom
to
an
italian
named
giovanni
capella
his
stage
name
no
he
is
really
an
italian
brett
pleasantry
was
successful
in
its
object
david
hume
regained
his
equanimity
and
sat
down
again
after
a
pause
he
went
on
may
i
ask
brett
before
i
tell
you
my
part
of
the
story
if
you
formed
any
theories
as
to
the
occurrence
at
the
time
the
barrister
consulted
his
memoranda
something
that
met
his
eyes
caused
him
to
smile
i
see
he
said
that
winter
of
scotland
yard
was
convinced
of
your
guilt
that
is
greatly
in
your
favour
why
hume
disdained
the
police
but
brett
remark
evoked
curiosity
because
winter
is
a
most
excellent
officer
whose
intellect
is
shackled
by
handcuffs
says
the
frenchman
as
a
specific
for
human
conduct
up
says
winter
when
he
is
inquiring
into
a
crime
of
course
he
is
right
nine
times
out
of
ten
but
if
in
the
tenth
case
intellect
conflicts
with
handcuffs
the
handcuffs
win
being
stronger
in
his
instance
hume
was
in
no
mood
to
appreciate
the
humours
of
scotland
yard
so
the
other
continued
the
most
telling
point
against
you
was
the
fact
that
not
only
the
butler
footman
and
two
housemaids
but
you
yourself
at
the
coroner
inquest
swore
that
the
small
japanese
knife
was
in
its
sheath
during
the
afternoon
indeed
the
footman
said
it
was
there
to
the
best
of
his
belief
at
midnight
then
again
a
small
drawer
in
sir
had
been
wrenched
open
whilst
you
were
alone
in
the
room
on
this
point
the
footman
was
positive
near
the
drawer
rested
the
sword
from
which
its
viperish
companion
had
been
abstracted
had
not
the
butler
found
sir
alan
body
still
palpitating
and
testified
beyond
any
manner
of
doubt
that
you
were
apparently
sleeping
in
the
library
you
would
have
been
hanged
mr
hume
probably
the
air
of
probability
attending
your
execution
would
have
been
most
convincing
is
my
case
then
so
desperate
you
can
not
be
tried
again
you
know
i
do
not
mean
that
i
want
to
establish
my
innocence
to
compel
society
to
reinstate
me
as
a
man
profoundly
wronged
above
all
to
marry
the
woman
i
love
brett
amused
himself
by
rapidly
projecting
several
rings
of
smoke
through
a
large
one
so
you
really
are
innocent
he
said
after
a
pause
david
hume
rose
from
his
chair
and
reached
for
his
hat
gloves
and
stick
you
have
crushed
my
remaining
hope
of
emancipation
he
exclaimed
bitterly
you
have
the
repute
of
being
able
to
pluck
the
heart
out
of
a
mystery
brett
so
when
you
assume
that
i
am
guilty
i
have
assumed
nothing
of
the
kind
you
seem
to
possess
the
faculty
of
kindly
exercise
it
and
answer
my
questions
did
you
kill
your
cousin
no
who
did
kill
him
i
do
not
know
do
you
suspect
anybody
not
in
the
remotest
degree
did
he
kill
himself
that
theory
was
discussed
privately
but
not
brought
forward
at
the
trial
three
doctors
said
it
was
not
worthy
of
a
moment
consideration
well
you
need
not
shout
your
replies
and
i
would
prefer
to
see
you
comfortably
seated
unless
of
course
you
feel
more
at
ease
near
the
door
a
trifle
shamefacedly
hume
returned
to
his
former
position
near
the
fireplace
that
shrine
to
which
all
the
household
gods
do
reverence
even
in
the
height
of
summer
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
occupants
of
a
room
deliberately
grouping
themselves
without
reference
to
the
grate
brett
placed
the
open
on
his
knees
and
ran
an
index
finger
along
underlined
passages
in
the
manner
of
counsel
consulting
a
brief
why
did
you
give
your
cousin
this
sword
because
he
told
me
he
was
making
a
collection
of
japanese
arms
and
i
remarked
that
my
grandfather
on
my
mother
side
admiral
cunningham
had
brought
this
weapon
with
others
from
the
far
east
it
lay
for
fifty
years
in
our
at
glen
tochan
so
you
met
sir
alan
soon
after
his
return
home
yes
in
london
the
day
he
arrived
came
to
town
on
purpose
in
fact
afterwards
i
travelled
north
and
he
went
to
beechcroft
how
long
afterwards
be
particular
as
to
dates
it
is
quite
a
simple
matter
owing
to
the
season
alan
reached
charing
cross
from
brindisi
on
december
we
remained
together
that
is
lived
at
the
same
hotel
paid
calls
in
company
visited
the
same
restaurants
went
to
the
same
theatres
until
the
night
of
the
when
we
parted
it
is
a
tradition
of
my
family
that
the
members
of
it
should
spend
christmas
together
a
somewhat
unusual
tradition
in
scotland
is
it
not
yes
but
it
was
my
mother
wish
so
my
father
and
i
keep
the
custom
up
your
father
is
still
living
yes
thank
goodness
he
is
now
the
sixth
baronet
he
is
not
neither
he
nor
i
will
assume
the
title
while
the
succession
bears
the
taint
of
crime
did
you
quarrel
with
your
cousin
in
london
not
by
word
or
thought
he
seemed
to
be
surprised
when
i
told
him
of
my
engagement
to
helen
but
he
warmly
congratulated
me
one
afternoon
he
was
a
trifle
but
not
with
me
tell
me
about
this
his
sister
is
or
was
then
a
rather
rapid
young
lady
she
discovered
that
certain
would
honour
her
drafts
on
her
brother
and
she
had
been
going
the
pace
somewhat
heavily
alan
went
to
see
her
told
her
to
stop
this
practice
and
sent
formal
notice
to
the
same
effect
through
his
solicitors
to
the
bill
discounters
it
annoyed
him
not
on
account
of
the
money
but
that
his
sister
should
act
in
such
a
way
ah
this
is
important
it
was
not
mentioned
at
the
trial
why
should
it
be
who
can
say
i
wish
to
goodness
i
had
helped
your
butler
to
raise
sir
alan
lifeless
body
but
about
this
family
dispute
was
there
a
scene
tears
recriminations
not
a
bit
you
do
know
rita
we
used
to
call
her
rita
because
as
boys
we
teased
her
by
saying
her
name
was
margharita
and
not
margaret
why
she
has
such
a
foreign
manner
and
style
how
did
she
acquire
them
she
was
a
big
girl
six
years
old
and
tall
for
her
age
when
her
parents
settled
down
in
england
she
first
spoke
italian
and
picked
up
italian
ways
from
her
nurse
an
old
party
who
was
devotedly
attached
to
her
even
alan
was
a
good
italian
linguist
and
given
to
foreign
manners
when
a
little
chap
but
harrow
soon
knocked
them
out
of
him
rita
retained
them
i
see
a
curious
household
i
should
have
expected
this
young
lady
to
upbraid
her
brother
after
the
style
of
the
prima
donna
in
grand
opera
no
he
told
me
she
laughed
at
him
and
invited
him
to
witness
the
trying
on
of
a
fancy
dress
costume
the
of
night
which
she
wore
at
a
the
night
he
was
murdered
when
did
she
get
married
last
january
at
naples
very
suddenly
and
without
the
knowledge
of
any
of
her
relatives
she
had
been
living
at
beechcroft
nearly
a
year
then
yes
she
went
south
in
the
winter
the
reason
she
gave
was
that
the
hall
would
be
depressing
on
the
anniversary
of
her
brother
death
she
had
become
most
popular
in
the
district
helen
is
very
fond
of
her
and
was
quite
shocked
to
hear
of
her
marriage
the
local
people
do
not
like
signor
capella
why
it
is
difficult
to
give
a
reason
miss
layton
does
not
indulge
in
details
but
that
is
the
impression
i
gather
from
her
letters
hume
paused
and
brett
shot
a
quick
glance
at
him
finish
what
you
were
going
to
say
he
said
only
this
helen
and
i
have
mutually
released
each
other
from
our
engagement
and
in
the
same
breath
have
refused
to
be
released
that
is
if
you
understand
the
barrister
nodded
the
result
is
that
we
are
both
thoroughly
miserable
our
respective
fathers
do
not
like
the
idea
of
our
marriage
under
the
circumstances
we
are
simply
drifting
in
the
feeble
hope
that
some
day
a
kindly
providence
will
dissipate
the
cloud
that
hangs
over
me
ah
brett
i
am
a
rich
man
command
the
limits
of
my
fortune
but
clear
me
prove
to
helen
that
her
faith
in
my
innocence
is
justified
for
goodness
sake
light
another
cigarette
snapped
the
barrister
you
have
interfered
with
my
line
of
thought
it
is
all
wriggly
quite
a
minute
elapsed
before
he
began
again
what
caused
the
trouble
at
eastham
ball
i
think
i
can
explain
that
it
seems
that
alan
father
told
him
to
get
married
told
him
well
left
instructions
how
i
do
not
know
i
only
gathered
as
much
from
my
cousin
remarks
well
it
was
not
until
his
final
that
he
realised
what
a
beautiful
woman
the
jolly
little
girl
he
knew
as
a
boy
had
developed
into
she
was
just
the
kind
of
wife
he
wanted
and
i
fancy
he
imagined
i
had
stolen
a
march
on
him
but
he
was
a
thoroughly
straightforward
manly
fellow
and
something
very
much
out
of
the
common
must
have
upset
him
before
he
vented
his
anger
on
me
and
helen
have
you
any
notion
not
the
least
pardon
me
i
suppose
you
were
going
to
ask
if
i
guessed
the
cause
yes
it
is
quite
unfathomable
we
parted
the
best
of
friends
in
london
although
he
knew
all
about
the
engagement
we
met
again
at
on
new
year
eve
and
he
was
very
short
with
me
i
can
only
vaguely
assume
that
some
feeling
of
resentment
had
meanwhile
been
working
up
in
him
and
it
found
expression
during
his
chat
with
helen
in
the
conservatory
did
you
use
threats
to
him
during
the
subsequent
wrangle
threats
good
gracious
no
i
was
angry
with
him
for
spoiling
miss
layton
enjoyment
i
called
him
an
ass
and
said
that
he
had
better
have
remained
away
another
year
than
come
back
and
make
mischief
that
is
all
eastham
was
far
more
outspoken
indeed
what
did
she
say
she
hinted
that
his
temper
was
a
reminiscence
of
his
southern
birth
always
a
sore
point
with
him
and
contrasted
me
with
him
to
his
disadvantage
all
very
unfair
of
course
but
you
see
she
was
the
hostess
and
alan
had
upset
her
party
very
much
so
you
walked
home
and
resolved
to
hold
out
the
olive
branch
most
decidedly
i
was
older
perhaps
a
trifle
more
sedate
i
knew
that
helen
loved
me
there
were
no
difficulties
in
the
way
of
our
marriage
which
was
arranged
for
the
following
spring
indeed
my
second
trial
took
place
on
the
very
date
we
had
selected
it
was
my
duty
to
use
poor
alan
gently
even
his
foolish
and
unreasonable
jealousy
was
a
compliment
brett
threw
the
on
to
the
table
he
clasped
his
hands
in
front
of
his
knees
tucking
his
heels
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
hume
he
said
slowly
gazing
fixedly
at
the
other
i
believe
you
you
did
not
kill
your
cousin
chapter
iii
the
dream
thank
you
was
the
quiet
answer
you
hinted
at
some
supernatural
influence
in
relation
to
this
crime
what
did
you
mean
ah
that
is
the
unpublished
part
of
the
affair
we
are
a
scots
family
as
our
name
implies
the
first
sir
alan
frazer
became
a
baronet
owing
to
his
services
to
king
george
during
the
rebellion
there
was
some
trouble
about
a
sequestered
estate
now
our
place
in
scotland
which
belonged
to
his
wife
brother
a
hume
and
a
rebel
anyhow
in
he
fought
a
duel
with
hume
son
his
own
nephew
by
marriage
and
was
killed
really
broke
in
brett
this
ancient
history
is
quite
to
the
point
sir
alan
the
first
fought
and
died
in
front
of
the
library
at
beechcroft
the
barrister
commenced
to
study
the
moulding
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
he
was
succeeded
by
his
grandson
a
little
lad
of
eight
in
after
a
heavy
drinking
bout
the
second
sir
alan
cut
his
throat
and
chose
the
scene
of
his
ancestor
duel
for
the
operation
a
remarkable
coincidence
in
during
a
bread
riot
the
third
baronet
was
stabbed
with
a
pitchfork
whilst
facing
a
mob
in
the
same
place
then
a
long
interval
occurred
again
a
small
child
became
the
heir
three
years
ago
the
fourth
baronet
expired
whilst
the
library
windows
were
being
opened
to
admit
the
litter
on
which
he
was
carried
from
the
the
fate
of
the
fifth
you
know
brett
chair
emitted
a
series
of
squeaks
as
he
urged
it
closer
to
the
wall
at
the
proper
distance
he
stretched
out
his
leg
and
pressed
an
electric
bell
with
his
toe
decanters
and
syphons
smith
he
cried
when
the
door
opened
which
do
you
take
whisky
or
brandy
mr
hume
he
inquired
whisky
but
i
assure
you
i
am
quite
serious
these
things
serious
if
my
name
were
nothing
less
than
a
runaway
would
take
me
to
beechcroft
i
have
never
previously
heard
such
a
marvellous
recital
we
are
a
race
my
uncle
and
cousin
knew
how
strangely
fate
had
pursued
every
heir
to
the
title
yet
each
hoped
that
in
his
person
the
tragic
sequence
would
be
broken
oddly
enough
my
father
holds
that
the
family
curse
or
whatever
it
is
has
now
exhausted
itself
what
grounds
has
he
for
the
belief
none
save
a
highlander
readiness
to
accept
signs
and
portents
look
at
this
seal
he
unfastened
from
his
waistcoat
his
watch
and
chain
with
a
small
bunch
of
pendants
attached
and
handed
them
to
brett
the
latter
examined
the
seal
with
deep
interest
it
was
cut
into
a
bloodstone
and
showed
a
head
surmounted
by
five
pointed
rays
like
a
crown
of
daggers
i
can
not
decipher
the
motto
he
said
what
is
it
fortis
et
audax
hum
and
bold
a
legend
too
he
reached
to
his
bookcase
for
burke
general
armoury
after
a
brief
search
he
asked
do
you
know
anything
about
heraldry
nothing
whatever
then
listen
to
this
the
crest
of
your
house
is
stag
head
erased
argent
charged
with
a
star
of
five
rays
gules
it
is
peculiar
yes
so
my
father
says
but
why
does
it
appeal
to
you
in
that
way
because
means
in
this
instance
a
stag
head
torn
forcibly
from
the
body
the
severed
part
being
jagged
like
the
teeth
of
a
saw
and
means
now
such
heraldic
rays
are
usually
azure
or
blue
by
jove
you
have
hit
upon
the
old
man
idea
he
contends
that
those
five
points
signify
the
founder
of
the
baronetcy
and
his
four
lineal
descendants
moreover
the
race
is
now
extinct
in
the
direct
succession
the
title
goes
to
a
collateral
branch
brett
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
it
is
certainly
very
strange
he
murmured
that
the
knowledge
of
some
member
of
the
college
of
heralds
should
evolve
these
armorial
bearings
with
their
weird
significance
does
this
account
for
your
allusion
to
the
supernatural
partly
do
not
forget
my
dream
tell
it
to
me
during
the
trials
my
counsel
a
very
able
man
by
the
way
you
know
him
of
course
dobbie
only
referred
to
the
fact
that
i
dreamed
my
cousin
was
in
some
mortal
danger
and
that
my
exclamation
is
murdered
was
really
a
startled
comment
on
my
part
induced
by
the
butler
words
that
is
not
correct
i
never
told
dobbie
the
details
of
my
dream
or
vision
oh
did
you
men
have
been
hanged
before
because
they
thought
they
could
construct
a
better
line
of
defence
than
their
counsel
i
had
nothing
to
defend
i
was
innocent
moreover
i
knew
i
should
not
be
convicted
the
barrister
well
remembered
the
view
of
the
case
taken
by
the
bar
mess
even
the
redoubtable
dobbie
was
afraid
of
the
jury
his
face
must
have
conveyed
dubiety
with
respect
to
hume
last
remark
for
the
other
continued
eagerly
it
is
quite
true
wait
until
i
have
concluded
after
the
footman
brought
the
whisky
and
soda
to
the
library
that
night
i
took
a
small
quantity
and
pulled
an
in
front
of
the
fire
i
was
tired
having
travelled
all
the
preceding
night
and
part
of
the
day
hence
the
warmth
and
comfort
soon
sent
me
to
sleep
i
have
a
hazy
recollection
of
the
man
coming
in
to
put
some
coal
on
the
fire
in
a
fashion
i
knew
that
it
was
not
my
cousin
but
a
servant
i
settled
down
a
trifle
more
comfortably
and
everything
became
a
blank
then
i
thought
i
awoke
i
looked
out
through
the
windows
and
to
my
astonishment
it
was
broad
daylight
the
trees
too
were
covered
with
leaves
the
sun
was
shining
and
there
was
every
evidence
of
a
fine
day
in
early
summer
in
some
indefinite
way
i
realised
that
the
library
was
no
longer
the
room
which
i
knew
the
furniture
and
carpets
were
different
the
books
were
a
very
handsome
stood
near
the
open
window
there
was
no
litter
of
newspapers
or
magazines
before
i
could
begin
to
piece
together
these
curious
discrepancies
in
the
normal
condition
of
things
i
saw
two
men
riding
up
the
avenue
where
the
yew
trees
by
the
way
were
loftier
and
finer
in
every
way
than
those
really
existing
the
horsemen
were
dressed
in
such
strange
fashion
that
unfortunately
i
paid
little
heed
to
their
faces
they
wore
frilled
waistcoats
redingotes
with
huge
lapels
and
cuffs
hats
and
gigantic
boots
they
dismounted
when
close
to
the
house
one
man
held
both
horses
the
other
advanced
i
was
just
going
to
look
him
straight
in
the
face
when
another
figure
appeared
coming
from
that
side
of
the
hall
where
the
entrance
is
situated
this
was
a
gentleman
in
very
elegant
garments
hatless
with
powdered
queue
pink
satin
coat
embroidered
with
lace
pink
satin
white
silk
stockings
and
low
shoes
as
he
walked
a
smart
cane
swung
from
his
left
wrist
by
a
silk
tassel
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
an
ivory
box
the
two
men
met
and
seemed
to
have
a
heated
argument
bitter
and
passionate
on
one
side
studiously
scornful
on
the
other
this
was
all
in
dumb
show
not
a
word
did
i
hear
my
amazed
wits
were
fully
taken
up
with
noting
their
clothes
their
postures
the
trappings
of
the
horses
the
eighteenth
century
aspect
of
the
library
strange
is
it
not
i
did
not
look
at
their
faces
hume
paused
to
gulp
down
the
contents
of
his
tumbler
brett
said
not
a
word
but
sat
intent
absorbed
wondering
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
speaker
all
at
once
the
dispute
became
vehement
the
more
stylishly
attired
man
disappeared
but
returned
instantly
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
the
stranger
as
we
may
call
him
whipped
out
a
claymore
and
the
two
fought
fiercely
by
jove
it
was
no
stage
combat
or
french
duel
they
went
for
each
other
as
if
they
meant
it
there
was
no
stopping
to
take
breath
nor
drawing
apart
after
a
foiled
attack
each
man
tried
to
kill
the
other
as
speedily
as
possible
three
times
they
circled
round
in
furious
then
the
stranger
got
his
point
home
the
other
in
mortal
agony
dropped
his
weapon
and
tried
with
both
hands
to
tear
his
adversary
blade
from
his
breast
he
failed
and
staggered
back
the
victor
still
shoving
the
claymore
through
his
opponent
body
then
and
not
until
then
i
saw
the
face
of
the
man
who
was
wounded
probably
killed
it
was
my
cousin
alan
david
hume
stopped
again
his
bronzed
face
was
pale
now
with
his
left
hand
he
swept
huge
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
brow
but
his
class
demands
coolness
in
the
most
desperate
moments
he
actually
struck
a
match
and
relighted
his
cigarette
i
suppose
you
occasionally
have
a
nightmare
after
an
indigestible
supper
brett
he
went
on
and
have
experienced
a
peculiar
sensation
of
dumb
palsy
in
the
presence
of
some
unknown
but
terrifying
danger
well
such
was
my
exact
state
at
that
moment
alan
fell
apparently
lifeless
the
stranger
kissed
his
sword
which
required
a
strong
tug
before
he
could
disengage
it
rattled
it
back
into
the
scabbard
rejoined
his
companion
and
the
two
rode
off
without
once
looking
back
i
can
see
them
now
with
hair
tied
in
a
knot
beneath
their
quaint
hats
their
hips
absurdly
swollen
by
the
huge
pockets
of
their
coats
their
boots
hanging
over
their
knees
they
wore
big
brass
spurs
with
tremendous
rowels
and
the
cantles
of
their
saddles
were
high
and
alan
lay
motionless
i
could
neither
speak
nor
move
whether
i
was
sitting
or
standing
i
can
not
tell
you
nor
do
i
know
how
i
was
supposed
to
be
attired
a
darkness
came
over
my
eyes
then
a
voice
voice
whispered
to
me
not
dearest
the
wrong
is
avenged
i
awoke
to
find
the
trembling
butler
shouting
in
my
ear
that
his
master
was
lying
dead
outside
the
house
now
brett
i
ask
you
would
you
have
submitted
that
fairy
tale
to
a
jury
i
was
quite
assured
of
a
verdict
in
my
favour
though
the
first
disagreement
almost
shook
my
faith
in
promise
but
i
did
not
want
to
end
my
days
in
a
criminal
lunatic
asylum
he
did
not
appear
to
expect
an
answer
he
was
quite
calm
again
and
even
his
eyes
had
lost
their
intensity
the
mere
telling
of
his
uncanny
experience
had
a
soothing
effect
he
nonchalantly
readjusted
his
watch
and
chain
and
noted
the
time
i
have
gone
far
beyond
my
stipulated
half
hour
he
said
forcing
a
deprecatory
smile
yes
far
beyond
indeed
you
carried
me
back
to
but
heaven
alone
knows
when
you
will
end
will
you
take
up
my
case
can
you
doubt
it
do
you
think
i
would
throw
aside
the
most
remarkable
criminal
puzzle
i
have
ever
tackled
brett
i
can
not
find
words
to
thank
you
if
you
succeed
and
you
inspire
me
with
confidence
helen
and
i
will
strive
to
merit
your
lifelong
friendship
miss
layton
knows
the
whole
of
your
story
of
course
yes
she
and
my
father
only
i
must
inform
you
that
i
had
never
heard
the
full
reason
of
the
duel
between
the
first
sir
alan
and
his
nephew
but
my
father
knew
it
fairly
well
and
the
details
fitted
in
exactly
with
my
vision
i
can
hardly
call
it
a
dream
what
was
the
nephew
name
david
hume
brett
jumped
up
and
paced
about
the
room
these
coincidences
defy
analysis
he
exclaimed
your
christian
name
is
david
your
surname
joins
both
families
why
the
thing
is
a
romance
of
the
wildest
sort
unhappily
it
has
a
tragic
side
for
me
yes
the
story
can
not
end
here
you
and
your
have
suffered
miss
layton
must
be
a
very
estimable
young
lady
one
worth
winning
she
will
be
a
true
and
loyal
wife
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
solve
the
riddle
someone
murdered
my
cousin
that
is
our
only
solid
fact
at
present
the
family
tradition
is
passing
strange
but
it
will
not
serve
in
a
court
of
law
i
may
fail
for
the
first
time
but
i
will
try
hard
when
can
you
accompany
me
to
stowmarket
the
question
disconcerted
his
eager
auditor
the
young
man
countenance
clouded
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
go
there
he
asked
certainly
you
must
throw
aside
all
delicacy
of
feeling
sacrifice
even
your
own
sentiments
that
is
the
one
locality
where
you
do
wish
to
be
seen
of
course
it
is
indeed
i
can
not
help
that
i
must
have
the
assistance
of
your
local
and
family
knowledge
to
decide
the
knotty
points
sure
to
arise
when
i
begin
the
inquiry
can
you
start
this
afternoon
yes
very
well
come
and
lunch
with
me
at
my
club
then
we
will
separate
to
meet
again
at
liverpool
street
smith
pack
my
traps
for
a
week
brett
was
in
the
hall
now
but
he
suddenly
stopped
his
companion
by
the
way
hume
you
may
like
to
wire
to
miss
layton
my
man
will
send
the
telegram
for
you
david
hume
barrier
of
proud
reserve
vanished
from
that
instant
the
kindly
familiarity
of
the
barrister
words
to
one
who
during
many
weary
days
suspected
all
men
of
loathing
him
as
a
murderer
at
large
was
directed
by
infinite
tact
hume
held
out
his
hand
you
a
good
chap
he
said
chapter
iv
through
the
library
window
hume
did
not
send
a
telegram
to
the
sleagill
rectory
he
explained
that
owing
to
the
attitude
adopted
by
the
rev
wilberforce
layton
helen
avoided
friction
with
her
father
by
receiving
his
hume
letters
under
cover
to
eastham
the
younger
man
was
quick
to
note
that
brett
did
not
like
this
arrangement
he
smilingly
protested
that
there
was
no
deception
in
the
matter
helen
would
never
consent
to
anything
that
savoured
of
subterfuge
he
explained
her
father
knows
well
that
she
hears
from
me
constantly
he
is
a
studious
reserved
old
gentleman
he
was
very
much
shocked
by
the
tragedy
and
his
daughter
innocent
association
with
it
he
told
me
quite
plainly
that
under
the
circumstances
i
ought
to
consider
the
engagement
at
an
end
possibly
i
resented
an
imputation
not
intended
by
him
i
made
some
unfair
retort
about
his
and
promptly
sent
helen
a
formal
release
she
tore
it
up
and
at
the
same
time
accepted
it
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
we
met
at
eastham
house
that
good
lady
has
remained
my
firm
friend
throughout
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
brett
that
i
broke
down
utterly
well
we
began
by
sending
messages
to
each
other
through
eastham
then
i
forwarded
to
helen
in
the
same
way
a
copy
of
a
rough
diary
of
my
travels
she
wrote
to
me
direct
i
replied
the
position
now
is
that
she
will
not
marry
me
without
her
consent
and
she
will
marry
no
one
else
he
is
aware
of
our
correspondence
she
always
tells
him
of
my
movements
the
poor
old
rector
is
worried
to
know
how
to
act
for
the
best
his
daughter
happiness
is
at
stake
and
so
my
unhappy
affairs
have
drifted
aimlessly
for
more
than
a
year
the
drifting
must
cease
said
brett
decisively
beechcroft
hall
will
probably
provide
scope
for
activity
they
reached
stowmarket
by
a
late
train
next
morning
they
drove
to
sleagill
a
pretty
village
with
a
norman
church
tower
standing
squarely
in
the
midst
of
lofty
trees
and
cottages
and
nestling
in
gardens
a
bower
of
orchards
and
green
lanes
murmured
the
barrister
as
their
sped
rapidly
over
the
smooth
highway
hume
was
driving
he
pointed
out
the
rectory
his
eyes
were
eagerly
searching
the
lawn
and
the
garden
but
he
was
denied
a
sight
of
his
divinity
the
few
people
they
encountered
gazed
at
them
curiously
hume
was
seemingly
unrecognised
here
is
eastham
house
he
said
checking
the
horse
pace
as
they
approached
a
roomy
mansion
occupying
an
angle
where
the
village
street
sharply
bifurcated
and
there
is
beechcroft
the
lodge
faced
the
road
along
which
they
were
advancing
beyond
the
gates
the
drive
with
its
selvages
of
deep
green
turf
led
straight
to
the
elizabethan
house
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
the
ground
in
the
rear
rose
gently
through
a
mile
or
more
of
the
home
park
immediately
behind
the
hall
was
a
dense
plantation
of
spruce
and
larch
the
man
who
planned
the
estate
evidently
possessed
both
taste
and
spirit
it
presented
a
beautiful
and
pleasing
picture
a
sense
of
homeliness
was
given
by
a
number
of
alderney
cattle
and
young
hunters
grazing
in
the
park
on
both
sides
of
the
avenue
beechcroft
had
a
reputation
in
metropolitan
its
were
always
in
demand
we
will
leave
the
conveyance
here
announced
brett
i
prefer
to
walk
to
the
house
the
hotel
groom
went
to
the
horse
head
he
did
not
hear
the
question
i
suppose
both
you
and
your
cousin
quitted
eastham
house
by
that
and
entered
the
park
through
the
wicket
yes
assented
hume
though
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
hit
upon
the
rather
than
the
main
entrance
because
the
is
built
out
at
the
back
it
was
originally
a
granary
the
conservatory
opens
into
the
garden
on
the
other
side
as
there
was
a
large
number
of
guests
eastham
required
all
her
front
rooms
for
supper
and
extra
servants
so
she
asked
people
to
halt
their
carriages
at
the
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
the
was
provided
by
the
there
whilst
the
yard
was
carpeted
and
covered
with
an
awning
brett
rattled
on
in
this
way
heedless
of
his
companion
blank
amazement
perhaps
secretly
enjoying
it
hume
was
so
taken
aback
that
he
stood
poised
on
the
step
of
the
vehicle
and
forgot
to
slip
the
reins
into
the
catch
on
the
splashboard
i
told
you
none
of
these
things
he
cried
of
course
not
they
are
obvious
but
tell
this
good
lady
that
we
are
going
to
the
hall
both
the
main
gate
and
wicket
were
fastened
and
the
wife
was
gazing
at
them
through
the
bars
hello
crowe
do
you
know
me
cried
hume
my
gracious
it
mr
david
gasped
the
woman
why
are
the
gates
locked
capella
is
not
receiving
visitors
sir
is
she
ill
no
sir
indisposed
i
think
capella
said
well
she
will
receive
me
at
any
rate
no
doubt
sir
it
will
be
all
right
she
hesitatingly
unbarred
the
wicket
and
the
two
men
entered
they
walked
slowly
up
the
drive
hume
was
restless
twice
he
looked
behind
him
he
stopped
it
was
here
he
said
that
the
two
men
dismounted
then
a
few
yards
farther
on
alan
came
round
from
the
door
there
and
they
fought
here
alan
forced
the
stranger
on
to
the
turf
when
he
was
stabbed
he
fell
here
he
pointed
to
a
spot
where
the
road
commenced
to
turn
to
the
left
to
clear
the
house
brett
watched
him
narrowly
the
young
man
was
describing
his
dream
not
the
actual
murder
the
vision
was
far
more
real
to
him
it
was
just
such
a
day
as
this
he
continued
it
might
have
been
almost
this
hour
the
library
windows
he
ceased
and
looked
fixedly
towards
the
house
brett
too
gazed
in
silence
they
saw
a
small
exceedingly
handsome
italian
a
young
man
with
eyes
and
a
mass
of
shining
black
hair
scowling
at
them
from
within
the
library
a
black
velvet
coat
and
a
brilliant
tie
were
the
only
bizarre
features
of
his
costume
they
served
sufficiently
to
enhance
his
foreign
appearance
such
a
man
would
be
correctly
placed
in
the
marble
frame
of
a
neapolitan
villa
here
he
was
unusual
as
brett
put
it
but
he
was
evidently
master
he
flung
open
the
window
and
said
with
some
degree
of
hauteur
whom
do
you
wish
to
see
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
his
accent
was
strongly
marked
but
his
words
were
well
chosen
and
civil
enough
had
his
tone
accorded
with
their
sense
as
it
was
he
might
be
deemed
rude
brett
advanced
are
you
signor
capella
he
inquired
capella
yes
then
you
can
indeed
be
of
much
assistance
this
gentleman
is
capella
cousin
david
corpo
di
baccho
the
italian
was
completely
taken
by
surprise
his
eyebrows
suddenly
stood
out
in
a
ridge
his
sallow
skin
could
not
become
more
pallid
to
show
emotion
he
flushed
a
swarthy
red
beyond
the
involuntary
exclamation
in
his
own
language
he
could
not
find
words
yes
explained
the
smiling
brett
he
is
a
near
relative
of
yours
by
marriage
we
were
told
by
the
that
capella
was
indisposed
but
under
the
circumstances
we
felt
assured
that
she
would
receive
her
cousin
unless
that
is
she
is
seriously
it
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
this
visit
capella
replied
to
the
barrister
but
looked
at
hume
he
had
an
unpleasant
habit
of
parting
his
lips
closely
to
his
teeth
like
the
silent
snarl
of
a
dog
undoubtedly
we
both
apologise
for
not
having
prepared
you
brett
smooth
even
voice
seemed
to
exasperate
the
other
who
continued
to
block
the
library
window
in
uncompromising
manner
and
you
sir
may
i
ask
who
you
are
my
name
is
brett
reginald
brett
a
friend
of
hume
who
i
may
mention
does
not
use
his
full
surname
at
present
the
italian
was
compelled
to
turn
his
glittering
eyes
upon
the
man
who
addressed
him
so
glibly
i
am
sorry
he
said
slowly
but
capella
is
too
unwell
to
meet
either
of
you
ah
we
share
your
regrets
nevertheless
as
a
preliminary
to
our
purpose
you
will
serve
our
needs
equally
well
may
we
not
come
in
capella
was
faced
with
difficult
alternatives
he
must
either
be
discourteous
to
two
gentlemanly
strangers
one
of
them
his
relative
or
admit
them
with
some
show
of
politeness
an
italian
may
be
rude
he
can
never
be
having
decided
capella
ushered
them
into
the
library
with
quick
transition
to
dignified
ease
he
asked
if
he
might
ring
for
any
refreshments
hume
who
glared
at
his
host
with
uncompromising
hostility
and
had
not
taken
any
part
in
the
conversation
shook
his
head
brett
surprised
both
for
different
reasons
by
readily
falling
in
with
capella
suggestion
a
whisky
and
soda
would
be
most
grateful
he
said
the
italian
moved
towards
the
bell
permit
me
cried
brett
he
rose
in
awkward
haste
and
upset
his
chair
with
a
loud
crash
on
the
parquet
floor
how
stupid
of
me
he
exclaimed
whilst
hume
wondered
what
had
happened
to
flurry
the
barrister
and
capella
smothered
a
curse
a
distant
bell
jangled
by
tacit
consent
there
was
no
further
talk
until
a
servant
appeared
the
man
was
a
stranger
to
hume
oddly
enough
brett
took
but
a
very
small
allowance
of
the
spirit
in
reality
he
hated
alcohol
in
any
form
during
the
earlier
hours
he
was
wont
to
declare
that
it
not
only
disturbed
his
digestion
but
destroyed
his
taste
for
tobacco
hume
did
not
yet
know
what
a
concession
to
exciting
circumstances
his
friend
had
made
the
previous
day
in
ordering
spirits
before
luncheon
when
the
servant
vanished
capella
settled
himself
in
his
chair
with
the
air
of
a
man
awaiting
explanations
yet
he
was
restless
and
disturbed
he
was
afraid
of
these
two
why
brett
determined
to
try
the
effect
of
generalities
you
probably
guess
the
object
of
our
visit
he
began
i
no
how
should
i
guess
as
the
husband
of
a
lady
so
closely
connected
with
hume
but
the
italian
seemed
to
be
firmly
resolved
to
end
the
suspense
caramba
he
broke
in
what
is
it
it
is
this
hume
has
asked
me
to
help
him
in
the
investigation
of
certain
the
library
door
swung
open
and
a
lady
entered
she
was
tall
graceful
her
cousinship
to
hume
was
unmistakable
in
both
there
was
the
air
of
aristocratic
birth
their
eyes
the
contour
of
their
faces
were
alike
but
the
fresh
complexion
of
the
man
was
replaced
in
the
woman
by
a
skin
whilst
her
hair
and
eyebrows
were
darker
she
was
strikingly
beautiful
a
plain
black
dress
set
off
a
figure
that
would
have
caused
a
sculptor
to
dream
of
chiselled
marble
a
passionate
voluptuous
woman
thought
brett
a
woman
easily
swayed
but
never
to
be
compelled
the
heroine
of
a
tragedy
her
first
expression
was
one
of
polite
inquiry
but
her
glance
fell
upon
hume
her
face
prone
to
betray
each
fleeting
emotion
exhibited
surprise
almost
consternation
you
davie
she
gasped
hume
went
to
meet
her
yes
rita
he
said
i
hope
you
are
glad
to
see
me
capella
was
profoundly
agitated
but
she
held
out
her
hand
and
summoned
the
quick
smile
of
an
actress
of
course
i
am
she
cried
i
did
not
know
you
were
in
england
why
did
you
not
let
me
know
and
why
are
you
here
i
only
returned
home
three
days
ago
my
journey
to
beechcroft
was
a
hasty
resolve
this
is
my
friend
reginald
brett
he
was
just
about
to
explain
to
capella
the
object
of
our
visit
when
you
came
in
neither
husband
nor
wife
looked
at
the
other
capella
was
flustered
indulging
in
desperate
surmises
but
she
laughed
readily
enough
i
heard
a
noise
in
this
room
and
then
the
bell
rang
i
thought
something
had
happened
you
know
i
mean
i
thought
there
was
no
one
here
i
fear
that
i
am
the
culprit
capella
your
husband
was
good
enough
to
invite
us
to
enter
by
the
window
and
i
promptly
disturbed
the
household
brett
pleasant
tones
came
as
a
relief
capella
glared
at
him
now
with
undisguised
hostility
for
the
barrister
adroit
ruse
had
outwitted
him
by
bringing
the
lady
from
the
which
gave
on
to
the
garden
and
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
please
do
not
take
the
blame
of
my
intrusion
brett
said
margaret
with
forced
composure
you
will
stay
for
luncheon
will
you
not
and
you
davie
are
you
at
mrs
eastham
her
concluding
question
was
eager
almost
wistful
her
cousin
answered
it
first
no
he
said
we
have
driven
over
from
stowmarket
and
unfortunately
put
in
the
barrister
we
are
pledged
to
visit
eastham
within
an
hour
the
announcement
seemed
to
please
capella
for
some
reason
at
present
hidden
from
brett
hume
of
course
was
mystified
by
the
course
taken
by
his
friend
but
held
his
peace
capella
brusquely
interfered
perhaps
rita
these
gentlemen
would
now
like
to
make
the
explanation
which
you
prevented
he
moved
towards
the
door
so
that
his
wife
could
rest
under
no
doubt
as
to
his
wishes
he
held
it
open
for
her
no
no
exclaimed
brett
this
matter
concerns
capella
personally
you
probably
forget
that
we
asked
to
be
allowed
to
see
her
in
the
first
instance
but
you
told
us
that
she
was
too
unwell
to
receive
us
for
an
instant
margaret
gazed
at
the
italian
with
imperious
scorn
then
she
deliberately
turned
her
back
on
him
and
seated
herself
close
to
her
cousin
capella
closed
the
door
and
walked
to
the
library
window
hume
openly
showed
his
pained
astonishment
at
this
little
scene
brett
treated
the
incident
as
a
domestic
commonplace
the
fact
is
he
explained
that
your
cousin
capella
has
sought
my
assistance
in
order
to
clear
his
name
of
the
odium
attached
to
it
by
the
manner
of
sir
alan
death
at
my
request
he
brought
me
here
in
this
house
in
this
very
room
such
an
inquiry
should
have
its
origin
wherever
it
may
lead
ultimately
the
lady
cheeks
became
ashen
her
large
eyes
dilated
is
not
that
terrible
business
ended
yet
she
cried
i
little
dreamed
that
such
could
be
the
object
of
your
visit
davie
what
has
happened
the
italian
swung
round
viciously
if
you
come
here
as
a
detective
brett
he
snapped
i
refer
you
to
the
police
is
known
to
them
chapter
v
from
behind
the
hedge
the
man
swarthy
rage
added
force
to
the
taunt
david
hume
leaped
up
but
brett
anticipated
him
gripping
his
arm
firmly
and
without
ostentation
margaret
too
had
risen
she
appeared
to
be
battling
with
some
powerful
emotion
choking
back
a
fierce
impulse
for
an
instant
the
situation
was
electrical
then
the
woman
clear
tones
rang
through
the
room
i
am
mistress
here
she
cried
giovanni
remain
silent
or
leave
us
how
dare
you
of
all
men
speak
thus
to
my
cousin
certainly
the
effect
of
the
barrister
straightforward
statement
was
but
brett
felt
that
a
family
quarrel
would
not
further
his
object
at
that
moment
it
was
necessary
to
stop
the
imminent
outburst
for
david
hume
and
giovanni
capella
were
silently
challenging
each
other
to
mortal
combat
what
a
place
of
to
the
descendants
of
the
georgian
baronet
was
this
library
with
its
spacious
french
windows
of
course
said
the
barrister
speaking
as
quietly
as
if
he
were
discussing
the
weather
such
a
topic
is
an
unpleasant
one
it
is
however
unavoidable
my
young
friend
here
is
determined
at
all
costs
to
discover
the
secret
of
sir
alan
murder
it
is
imperative
that
he
should
do
so
the
happiness
of
his
whole
life
depends
upon
his
success
until
that
mystery
is
solved
he
can
not
marry
the
woman
he
loves
do
you
mean
helen
layton
margaret
syllables
might
have
been
so
many
mortal
daggers
yes
is
david
still
in
love
with
her
yes
and
she
with
him
david
hume
broke
in
yes
rita
she
has
been
faithful
to
the
end
a
very
forcible
italian
oath
came
from
capella
as
he
passed
through
the
window
and
strode
rapidly
out
of
sight
passing
to
the
left
of
the
house
where
one
of
the
lines
of
yew
trees
ended
in
a
group
of
conservatories
margaret
was
now
deadly
white
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
bosom
forgive
me
she
sobbed
i
do
not
feel
well
you
will
both
be
always
welcome
here
let
no
one
interfere
with
you
but
i
must
leave
you
this
afternoon
she
staggered
to
the
door
her
cousin
caught
her
thank
you
davie
she
whispered
leave
me
now
i
will
be
all
right
soon
my
heart
troubles
me
no
do
not
ring
let
us
keep
our
miseries
from
the
servants
she
passed
out
leaving
hume
and
the
barrister
uncertain
how
best
to
act
the
situation
had
developed
with
a
vengeance
brett
was
more
bewildered
than
ever
before
in
his
life
that
scoundrel
killed
alan
and
now
he
wants
to
kill
his
own
wife
growled
hume
when
they
were
alone
brett
looked
through
him
rather
than
at
him
he
was
thinking
intently
for
a
long
time
minutes
it
seemed
to
his
fuming
companion
he
remained
motionless
with
glazed
immovable
eyes
then
he
awoke
to
action
quick
he
cried
tell
me
if
this
room
has
changed
much
since
you
were
last
here
is
the
furniture
the
same
is
that
the
what
chair
did
you
sit
in
where
was
it
placed
quick
man
you
have
wasted
eighteen
months
give
me
no
opinions
but
facts
thus
admonished
scared
somewhat
by
the
barrister
volcanic
energy
hume
obeyed
him
there
is
no
material
change
in
the
room
he
said
the
secretaire
is
the
same
you
see
here
is
the
drawer
which
was
broken
open
it
bears
the
marks
of
the
implement
used
to
force
the
lock
i
think
i
sat
in
this
chair
or
one
like
it
it
was
placed
here
my
face
was
turned
towards
the
fire
yet
in
my
dream
i
was
looking
through
the
centre
window
the
japanese
sword
rested
here
i
showed
you
where
alan
body
was
found
the
young
man
darted
about
the
room
to
illustrate
each
sentence
brett
followed
his
words
and
actions
without
comment
he
grabbed
his
hat
and
stick
we
will
return
later
in
the
day
he
said
let
us
go
at
once
and
call
on
mrs
eastham
eastham
why
because
i
want
to
see
miss
helen
layton
the
old
lady
can
send
for
her
hume
needed
no
urging
he
could
not
walk
fast
enough
they
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
when
brett
suddenly
stopped
and
checked
his
companion
behind
the
yew
trees
on
the
left
and
rendered
invisible
by
a
stout
hedge
a
man
was
running
running
at
top
speed
with
the
labouring
breath
of
one
unaccustomed
to
the
exercise
the
barrister
sprang
over
the
strip
of
turf
passed
among
the
trees
and
plunged
into
the
hedge
regardless
of
thorns
he
came
back
instantly
there
is
a
footpath
across
the
park
leading
towards
the
lodge
gates
where
does
it
come
out
he
asked
speaking
rapidly
in
a
low
tone
it
enters
the
road
near
the
avenue
close
to
the
gates
it
leads
from
a
farmhouse
a
lady
is
walking
through
the
park
towards
the
lodge
capella
is
running
to
intercept
her
come
we
may
hear
something
brett
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
along
the
turf
hume
followed
and
soon
they
were
near
the
lodge
crowe
saw
them
and
came
out
stop
her
gasped
brett
hume
signalled
the
woman
not
to
open
the
gate
she
watched
them
with
curiosity
the
barrister
slowed
down
and
quietly
made
his
way
to
the
leafy
angle
where
the
avenue
hedge
joined
that
which
shut
off
the
park
from
the
road
he
held
up
a
warning
hand
hume
stepped
warily
behind
him
and
both
men
looked
through
a
portion
of
the
hedge
where
briars
were
supplanted
by
hazel
bushes
capella
was
standing
panting
near
a
stile
a
girl
dressed
in
muslin
and
wearing
a
large
straw
hat
was
approaching
great
heavens
it
is
helen
exclaimed
hume
brett
grasped
his
shoulder
restrain
yourself
he
whispered
earnestly
luckily
capella
has
not
heard
you
i
regret
the
necessity
which
makes
us
eavesdroppers
but
it
is
a
fortunate
accident
all
the
same
not
a
word
remember
what
is
at
stake
they
could
not
see
the
italian
face
his
back
was
heaving
from
the
violence
of
his
exertion
miss
layton
was
walking
rapidly
towards
the
stile
obviously
she
had
perceived
the
waiting
man
and
she
was
not
pleased
her
pretty
face
flushed
and
sunburnt
wore
the
strained
aspect
of
a
woman
annoyed
but
trying
to
be
civil
it
was
she
who
took
the
initiative
good
day
capella
she
said
pleasantly
why
on
earth
did
you
run
so
fast
because
i
wished
to
be
here
before
you
miss
layton
replied
the
man
his
voice
tremulous
with
excitement
then
i
wish
i
had
known
because
i
could
have
beaten
you
easily
if
you
meant
to
race
me
that
was
not
my
object
well
now
you
have
attained
it
whatever
it
may
have
been
please
allow
me
to
get
over
the
stile
i
will
be
late
for
luncheon
my
father
wished
me
to
ascertain
how
farmer
burton
is
progressing
after
his
spill
he
was
thrown
from
his
whilst
coming
from
the
bury
edmund
fair
it
was
easy
for
the
listeners
behind
the
hedge
to
gather
that
the
affable
manner
was
affected
she
was
really
somewhat
alarmed
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
high
road
to
see
if
anyone
was
approaching
and
she
kept
at
some
distance
from
the
italian
do
not
play
with
me
nellie
said
capella
in
agonised
accents
i
am
consumed
with
love
of
you
can
you
not
at
least
give
me
your
pity
capella
she
cried
and
none
but
one
blind
to
all
save
his
own
passionate
desires
could
fail
to
note
her
lofty
disdain
how
can
you
be
so
base
as
to
use
such
language
to
me
base
to
love
you
again
i
say
it
base
and
unmanly
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
venture
to
so
insult
your
charming
wife
not
to
speak
of
the
insult
to
myself
when
you
so
far
forgot
yourself
a
fortnight
ago
as
to
hint
at
your
outrageous
ideas
regarding
me
i
forced
myself
to
remember
that
you
were
not
an
englishman
that
perhaps
in
your
country
there
may
be
a
social
code
which
permits
a
man
to
dishonour
his
home
and
to
annoy
a
defenceless
woman
i
can
not
forgive
you
a
second
time
let
me
pass
let
me
pass
i
tell
you
or
i
will
strike
you
brett
in
his
admiration
for
the
spirited
girl
who
notwithstanding
her
protestations
seemed
to
be
anything
but
defenceless
momentarily
forgot
his
companion
a
convulsive
tightening
of
hume
muscles
preparatory
to
a
leap
through
the
hedge
warned
him
in
time
idiot
he
whispered
as
he
clutched
him
again
were
not
the
others
so
taken
up
with
the
throbbing
influences
of
the
moment
they
must
have
heard
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
but
they
paid
little
heed
to
external
affairs
the
italian
was
speaking
nellie
he
said
you
will
drive
me
mad
but
listen
carissima
if
i
may
not
love
you
i
can
at
least
defend
you
david
the
man
who
murdered
my
wife
brother
has
returned
and
openly
boasts
that
you
are
waiting
to
marry
him
boasts
to
whom
pray
to
me
i
heard
him
say
this
not
fifteen
minutes
since
where
you
do
not
know
him
he
could
not
be
here
without
my
knowledge
then
it
is
true
you
do
intend
to
marry
this
unconvicted
felon
capella
i
really
think
you
are
what
english
people
call
but
you
believe
me
that
this
man
has
come
to
beechcroft
it
may
be
so
he
has
good
reasons
doubtless
for
keeping
his
presence
here
a
secret
whatever
they
may
be
i
shall
soon
know
them
helen
he
is
not
worthy
of
you
he
can
not
give
you
a
love
fierce
as
mine
nay
i
will
not
be
repelled
hear
me
my
wife
is
dying
i
will
be
free
in
a
few
months
bid
me
to
hope
i
will
not
trouble
you
i
will
go
away
but
i
swear
if
you
marry
frazer
neither
he
nor
you
will
long
enjoy
your
happiness
the
girl
made
no
reply
but
sprang
towards
the
stile
in
sheer
desperation
capella
strove
to
take
her
in
his
arms
not
indeed
with
intent
to
offer
her
any
violence
but
she
met
his
ardour
with
such
a
vigorous
buffet
that
he
lost
his
temper
he
caught
her
she
had
almost
surmounted
the
stile
but
her
dress
hampered
her
movements
the
italian
vowing
his
passion
in
an
ardent
flow
of
words
endeavoured
to
kiss
her
then
with
a
sigh
for
he
would
have
preferred
to
avoid
an
open
rupture
brett
let
go
his
hold
on
hume
indeed
if
he
had
not
done
so
there
must
have
been
a
fight
on
both
sides
of
the
hedge
he
turned
away
at
once
to
light
a
cigarette
what
followed
immediately
had
no
professional
interest
for
him
but
he
could
not
help
hearing
helen
shriek
of
delighted
surprise
and
certain
other
sounds
which
denoted
that
giovanni
was
being
used
as
a
football
by
his
near
relative
by
marriage
crowe
came
out
of
her
cottage
what
on
in
the
park
sir
she
inquired
anxiously
a
great
event
he
said
faust
is
kicking
mephistopheles
drat
them
colts
she
cried
adding
after
taking
thought
but
we
have
any
horses
of
them
names
sir
no
you
surprise
me
they
are
of
the
best
italian
pedigree
meanwhile
he
was
achieving
his
object
which
was
to
drive
crowe
back
towards
the
wicket
helen
voice
came
to
them
shrilly
that
will
do
davie
do
you
hear
me
why
bless
my
there
miss
layton
said
crowe
what
a
fine
little
boy
this
is
exclaimed
brett
stooping
over
a
urchin
is
he
the
oldest
good
gracious
sir
no
he
the
youngest
dear
me
i
would
not
have
thought
so
you
must
have
been
married
very
early
here
my
little
man
see
what
you
can
buy
for
what
a
nice
gentleman
he
is
to
be
sure
thought
the
wife
when
brett
passed
through
the
smaller
gate
assured
that
the
struggle
in
the
park
had
ended
just
fancy
jimmy
was
the
eldest
when
i
will
be
a
grandmother
come
august
if
all
goes
well
wi
kate
the
barrister
signed
to
the
groom
to
wait
and
joined
the
young
couple
who
now
appeared
in
the
roadway
a
haggard
dishevelled
and
furious
man
burst
through
the
avenue
hedge
and
ran
across
the
drive
crowe
he
almost
screamed
do
you
see
those
two
men
there
yes
sir
the
good
woman
was
startled
by
her
master
sudden
appearance
and
his
excited
state
they
are
never
to
be
admitted
to
the
grounds
again
do
you
understand
yes
sir
capella
turned
to
rush
away
up
the
avenue
but
he
was
compelled
to
limp
crowe
watched
him
wonderingly
and
tried
to
piece
together
in
her
mind
the
queer
sounds
and
occurrences
of
the
last
two
minutes
she
had
not
long
been
in
the
cottage
when
the
butler
arrived
you
let
two
gentlemen
in
a
while
ago
he
said
i
did
one
was
david
and
the
other
a
mr
brett
oh
was
that
the
tall
gentleman
name
i
expect
so
well
here
the
missus
written
order
that
whenever
they
want
to
come
to
the
or
go
anywheres
in
the
park
it
crowe
was
wise
enough
to
keep
her
own
counsel
but
when
the
butler
retired
she
said
then
i
obey
the
missus
an
master
can
settle
it
with
her
i
hold
by
anyhow
chapter
vi
an
old
acquaintance
helen
was
very
much
upset
by
the
painful
scene
which
had
just
been
enacted
its
vulgarity
appalled
her
in
a
little
hamlet
like
sleagill
a
riotous
cow
or
frightened
horse
supplied
sensation
for
a
week
what
would
happen
when
it
became
known
that
the
rector
daughter
had
been
attacked
by
the
squire
of
beechcroft
in
the
park
meadow
and
saved
from
his
embraces
only
after
a
vigorous
struggle
in
which
her
defender
was
david
concerning
whom
the
villagers
still
spoke
with
bated
breath
of
course
the
girl
imagined
that
many
people
must
have
witnessed
the
occurrence
the
appearance
of
brett
of
the
waiting
groom
and
of
a
chance
labourer
who
now
strode
up
the
village
street
led
her
to
think
so
she
did
not
realise
that
the
whole
affair
had
barely
lasted
a
minute
that
brett
was
hume
friend
the
a
stranger
who
had
seen
nothing
and
heard
little
whilst
the
villager
only
wondered
when
he
touched
his
cap
why
miss
layton
was
so
flustered
like
brett
attributed
her
agitation
to
its
right
cause
he
knew
that
this
healthy
and
athletic
young
woman
went
under
no
fear
of
capella
and
his
ravings
what
happened
when
you
jumped
the
hedge
he
said
to
hume
i
handled
that
scoundrel
somewhat
roughly
was
the
answer
it
was
nellie
here
who
begged
for
mercy
on
his
account
ah
well
the
incident
ended
very
pleasantly
no
one
saw
what
happened
save
the
principals
a
fortunate
thing
in
itself
we
want
to
prevent
a
nine
days
wonder
just
now
are
you
quite
sure
asked
miss
layton
overjoyed
at
this
expression
of
opinion
and
secretly
surprised
at
the
interest
taken
by
the
barrister
in
the
affair
for
hume
had
not
as
yet
found
time
to
tell
her
his
name
quite
sure
miss
layton
he
said
with
the
smile
which
made
him
such
a
prompt
favourite
with
women
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
observe
the
the
stage
was
quite
clear
for
the
chief
actors
and
now
may
i
make
a
suggestion
the
longer
we
remain
here
the
more
likely
are
we
to
attract
observation
hume
and
i
are
going
to
call
on
eastham
may
we
expect
you
in
an
hour
time
ca
you
come
in
with
us
now
exclaimed
david
eagerly
she
laughed
excitedly
being
yet
flurried
the
sudden
appearance
of
her
lover
tried
her
nerves
more
than
the
italian
passionate
avowal
no
indeed
she
cried
i
must
go
home
my
father
will
forget
all
about
his
lunch
otherwise
and
i
am
afraid
i
w
ant
to
cry
without
another
word
she
hurried
off
towards
the
rectory
my
dear
fellow
murmured
brett
to
the
disconsolate
hume
do
you
understand
she
can
not
bear
the
constraint
imposed
by
my
presence
at
this
moment
nor
could
she
meet
eastham
with
any
degree
of
composure
now
this
afternoon
she
will
return
a
mere
iceberg
eastham
i
am
sure
has
tact
i
am
going
to
the
hall
you
two
will
be
left
alone
for
hours
he
turned
aside
to
arrange
with
the
groom
concerning
the
care
of
the
horse
as
they
would
be
detained
some
time
in
the
village
then
the
two
men
approached
eastham
residence
that
good
person
a
motherly
old
lady
of
over
sixty
was
not
only
surprised
but
delighted
by
the
advent
of
david
hume
my
dear
boy
she
cried
advancing
to
meet
him
with
outstretched
hands
when
he
entered
the
what
fortunate
wind
has
blown
you
here
i
can
hardly
tell
you
auntie
he
said
both
helen
and
he
adopted
the
pleasing
fiction
of
a
relationship
that
did
not
exist
you
must
ask
mr
brett
thus
appealed
to
the
barrister
set
forth
in
a
few
explicit
words
the
object
of
their
visit
i
hope
and
believe
you
will
succeed
said
eastham
impulsively
providence
has
guided
your
steps
here
at
this
hour
you
can
not
imagine
how
miserable
that
man
capella
makes
me
why
cried
hume
darting
a
look
of
surprise
at
brett
because
he
is
simply
pestering
nellie
with
his
attentions
there
i
must
speak
plainly
he
has
gone
to
extremes
that
can
no
longer
be
misinterpreted
in
our
small
community
brett
she
explained
though
we
dearly
love
a
little
gossip
we
are
slow
to
believe
that
a
man
married
to
such
a
charming
if
somewhat
unconventional
woman
as
margaret
i
can
not
train
my
tongue
to
call
her
capella
would
deliberately
neglect
his
wife
and
dare
to
demonstrate
his
unlawful
affection
for
another
woman
especially
such
a
girl
as
helen
layton
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
inquired
brett
for
hume
was
too
furious
to
speak
for
some
months
but
it
is
only
a
fortnight
ago
since
helen
first
complained
of
it
to
me
i
promptly
told
capella
that
i
could
not
receive
him
again
at
my
house
he
discovered
that
nellie
came
here
a
good
deal
and
managed
to
call
about
the
same
time
as
she
did
then
he
found
that
she
was
interested
in
japanese
art
and
as
he
is
really
clever
in
that
respect
clever
interrupted
the
barrister
do
you
mean
that
he
understands
lacquer
work
satsuma
ware
painting
or
inlaying
is
he
a
connoisseur
or
a
student
it
is
all
greek
to
me
exclaimed
the
old
lady
but
unquestionably
the
bits
of
china
and
queer
carvings
he
often
brought
here
were
very
beautiful
nellie
did
not
like
him
personally
but
she
could
not
deny
his
knowledge
and
enthusiasm
margaret
too
used
to
invite
her
to
the
hall
for
miss
layton
has
great
taste
as
an
amateur
gardener
brett
but
this
friendship
suddenly
ceased
capella
became
very
strange
and
gloomy
in
his
manner
at
last
nellie
told
me
that
the
wretched
man
had
dared
to
utter
words
of
love
to
her
hinting
that
his
wife
could
not
live
long
and
that
he
would
come
in
for
her
fortune
now
as
my
poor
girl
has
been
the
most
faithful
soul
that
ever
lived
never
for
an
instant
doubting
that
some
day
the
cloud
would
lift
from
davie
you
may
imagine
what
a
shock
this
was
to
her
eastham
said
brett
suddenly
switching
the
conversation
away
from
the
italian
fantasy
you
are
well
acquainted
with
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
sir
alan
murder
have
you
formed
any
theory
about
the
crime
its
motive
or
its
possible
author
god
forgive
me
if
i
do
any
man
an
injury
but
in
these
last
few
days
i
have
had
my
suspicions
she
exclaimed
tell
me
your
reasons
it
arose
out
of
a
chance
remark
by
nellie
she
was
discussing
with
me
her
inexplicable
antipathy
to
capella
even
during
the
time
when
they
were
outwardly
good
friends
she
said
that
once
he
showed
her
a
japanese
sword
a
most
wonderful
piece
of
workmanship
with
veins
of
silver
and
gold
let
into
the
handle
and
part
of
the
blade
to
the
upper
part
of
the
scabbard
was
attached
a
knife
a
small
dagger
similar
yes
i
understand
an
implement
like
that
used
to
kill
sir
alan
exactly
nellie
at
first
hardly
realised
its
significance
then
she
hastily
told
capella
to
take
it
away
but
not
before
she
noticed
that
he
seemed
to
understand
the
dreadful
thing
it
is
fastened
in
its
sheath
by
a
hidden
spring
and
he
knew
exactly
how
to
open
it
any
person
not
accustomed
to
such
weapons
would
endeavour
to
pull
it
out
by
main
force
brett
did
not
press
eastham
to
pursue
her
theory
it
was
plain
that
she
regarded
the
italian
as
a
man
who
might
conceivably
be
the
murderer
of
his
wife
brother
this
was
enough
for
feminine
logic
hume
too
shared
the
same
belief
and
had
not
scrupled
to
express
it
openly
there
were
it
was
true
reasons
in
plenty
why
capella
should
have
committed
this
terrible
deed
he
was
presumably
affianced
to
margaret
at
the
time
apparently
her
father
will
had
contemplated
the
cutting
down
of
her
annual
allowance
the
young
heir
had
on
the
other
hand
made
up
the
deficit
but
why
did
these
artificial
restrictions
exist
why
were
precautions
taken
by
the
father
to
diminish
his
daughter
income
she
had
been
extravagant
both
father
and
brother
quarrelled
with
her
on
this
point
indeed
there
was
a
slight
family
disturbance
with
reference
to
it
during
sir
alan
last
visit
to
london
was
capella
mixed
up
with
it
at
last
there
was
a
glimmering
perception
of
motive
for
an
otherwise
fiendishly
irrational
act
did
it
tend
to
incriminate
the
italian
a
summons
to
luncheon
dispelled
the
momentary
gloom
of
their
thoughts
before
the
meal
ended
miss
layton
joined
them
brett
looked
at
his
watch
fifty
minutes
he
said
then
they
all
laughed
except
eastham
who
marvelled
at
the
coolness
of
the
meeting
between
the
girl
and
david
but
the
old
lady
was
have
you
met
before
she
cried
dearest
said
the
girl
kissing
her
do
you
mean
to
say
they
have
not
told
you
what
happened
in
the
park
that
will
require
a
special
sitting
said
brett
gaily
meanwhile
i
am
going
to
the
hall
i
suppose
you
do
not
care
to
accompany
me
hume
i
do
not
the
reply
was
so
emphatic
that
it
created
further
merriment
well
tell
me
quickly
what
this
new
secret
is
exclaimed
eastham
because
in
five
minutes
i
must
have
a
long
talk
with
my
cook
she
has
to
prepare
pies
and
pastry
sufficient
to
feed
nearly
a
hundred
school
children
next
monday
and
it
is
a
matter
of
much
calculation
brett
took
his
leave
i
knew
that
good
old
soul
would
be
tactful
he
said
to
himself
now
i
wonder
how
winter
made
such
a
colossal
mistake
as
to
imagine
that
hume
murdered
his
cousin
he
was
sure
of
the
affections
of
a
delightful
girl
he
could
not
succeed
to
the
property
he
has
declined
to
take
up
the
title
what
reason
could
he
have
for
committing
such
a
crime
then
a
man
walked
up
the
road
a
man
dressed
like
a
farmer
or
grazier
rotund
he
halted
opposite
eastham
house
where
the
barrister
still
stood
drawing
on
his
gloves
on
the
doorstep
yes
said
brett
aloud
you
an
egregious
ass
winter
why
mr
brett
asked
the
unabashed
detective
is
the
good
it
is
the
that
always
leads
you
astray
you
never
theorise
above
the
level
of
the
winter
yielded
to
not
unnatural
annoyance
with
habitual
caution
he
glanced
around
to
assure
himself
that
no
other
person
was
within
earshot
then
he
said
vehemently
i
tell
you
brett
that
swine
killed
sir
alan
you
use
strong
language
not
stronger
than
he
deserves
what
are
you
doing
here
i
heard
he
was
in
london
and
watched
him
i
saw
him
go
to
your
chambers
and
guessed
what
was
up
so
i
came
down
here
to
see
you
and
tell
you
what
i
know
out
of
pure
you
can
believe
it
or
not
brett
it
is
the
truth
he
has
been
tried
and
acquitted
he
can
not
be
tried
again
does
scotland
yard
i
on
my
holidays
brett
laughed
heartily
i
see
he
cried
a
holiday
for
how
long
fourteen
days
you
are
nothing
if
not
professional
i
suppose
it
was
not
your
first
offence
or
they
might
have
let
you
off
with
a
fine
the
detective
enjoyed
this
departmental
joke
he
grinned
broadly
anyhow
brett
he
said
you
and
i
have
been
engaged
on
too
many
smart
bits
of
work
for
me
to
stand
quietly
by
and
let
you
be
made
a
fool
of
the
barrister
came
nearer
and
said
in
a
low
tone
winter
you
have
never
been
more
mistaken
in
your
life
now
attend
to
my
words
if
you
help
me
you
will
in
the
first
place
be
well
paid
for
your
services
secondly
you
will
be
able
to
place
your
hand
on
the
true
murderer
of
sir
alan
or
i
will
score
my
first
failure
thirdly
scotland
yard
will
give
you
another
holiday
and
i
can
secure
you
some
shooting
in
scotland
what
say
you
the
detective
looked
thoughtful
long
experience
had
taught
him
not
to
argue
with
brett
when
the
latter
was
in
earnest
i
will
do
anything
in
my
power
he
said
but
there
is
more
in
this
business
than
perhaps
you
are
aware
of
more
than
ever
transpired
at
the
assizes
quite
so
and
a
good
deal
that
has
transpired
since
now
winter
argue
there
a
good
fellow
go
and
engage
the
landlord
of
the
local
inn
in
a
discussion
on
crops
i
am
off
to
beechcroft
hall
hume
and
i
will
call
for
you
on
our
way
back
to
stowmarket
in
our
private
at
the
hotel
there
i
will
explain
everything
they
parted
brett
was
promptly
admitted
by
crowe
and
walked
rapidly
up
the
avenue
winter
watched
his
retreating
figure
he
smart
i
know
he
smart
mused
the
detective
but
he
does
know
everything
about
this
affair
he
does
know
i
be
bound
that
david
waited
for
his
cousin
that
night
outside
the
library
i
know
it
worse
luck
until
after
he
was
acquitted
and
he
does
know
that
miss
nellie
layton
did
reach
home
until
though
she
left
the
ball
at
and
her
house
is
so
to
speak
a
minute
walk
distant
and
she
was
in
a
carriage
oh
there
more
in
this
case
than
meets
the
eye
i
ca
say
which
would
please
me
most
to
find
out
the
real
murderer
if
hume
did
do
it
or
prove
brett
to
be
in
the
wrong
chapter
vii
husband
and
wife
brett
did
not
hurry
on
his
way
to
the
hall
already
things
were
in
a
whirl
and
the
confusion
was
so
great
that
he
was
momentarily
unable
to
map
out
a
definite
line
of
action
the
relations
between
capella
and
his
wife
were
evidently
strained
almost
to
breaking
point
and
it
was
this
very
fact
which
caused
him
the
greatest
perplexity
they
had
been
married
little
more
than
six
months
they
were
an
extraordinarily
handsome
couple
apparently
well
suited
to
each
other
by
temperament
and
mutual
sympathies
whilst
their
means
were
ample
enough
to
permit
them
to
live
under
any
conditions
they
might
choose
and
gratify
personal
hobbies
to
the
fullest
extent
what
then
could
have
happened
to
divide
them
so
completely
surely
not
capella
passion
for
helen
layton
not
even
a
southerner
could
be
guilty
of
such
deliberate
rascality
such
ineffable
folly
during
the
first
few
months
after
his
marriage
to
a
beautiful
and
wealthy
wife
no
this
hypothesis
must
be
rejected
margaret
capella
had
drifted
apart
from
her
husband
almost
as
soon
as
they
reached
england
on
their
return
as
man
and
wife
capella
miserable
and
disillusioned
buried
alive
in
a
country
place
for
such
must
existence
in
beechcroft
mean
to
a
man
of
his
inclinations
had
discovered
a
startling
contrast
between
his
passionate
and
moody
spouse
and
the
bright
girl
whose
it
was
to
create
discord
between
the
inmates
of
the
hall
this
theory
did
not
wholly
exonerate
the
italian
but
it
explained
a
good
deal
the
barrister
saw
no
cause
as
yet
to
suspect
capella
of
the
young
baronet
murder
were
he
guilty
of
that
ghastly
crime
his
motive
must
have
been
to
secure
for
himself
the
position
he
was
now
deliberately
imperilling
all
for
a
girl
pretty
face
the
explanation
would
not
suffice
brett
had
seen
much
that
is
hidden
from
public
ken
in
the
vagaries
of
criminals
but
he
had
never
yet
met
a
man
wholly
bad
and
at
the
same
time
in
full
possession
of
his
senses
to
adopt
the
hasty
judgment
arrived
at
by
hume
and
eastham
capella
must
be
deemed
capable
of
murdering
his
wife
brother
of
bringing
about
the
death
of
his
wife
after
securing
the
reversion
of
her
vast
property
to
himself
and
of
falling
in
love
with
helen
all
in
the
same
breath
this
species
of
criminality
was
only
met
with
in
lunatics
and
capella
impressed
the
barrister
as
an
emotional
personage
capable
of
supreme
good
as
of
supreme
evil
but
quite
sane
the
question
to
be
solved
was
this
why
did
capella
and
his
wife
quarrel
in
the
first
instance
perhaps
that
way
light
might
come
he
asked
a
footman
if
capella
would
receive
him
the
man
glanced
at
his
card
yes
sir
he
said
at
once
madam
gave
instructions
that
if
either
you
or
david
called
you
were
to
be
taken
to
her
boudoir
where
she
awaits
you
the
room
was
evidently
on
the
first
floor
for
the
servant
led
him
up
the
magnificent
oak
staircase
that
climbed
two
sides
of
the
reception
hall
but
this
was
fated
to
be
a
day
of
interruptions
the
barrister
when
he
reached
the
landing
was
confronted
by
the
italian
a
word
with
you
brett
was
the
stiff
greeting
given
to
him
certainly
but
i
am
going
to
capella
room
she
can
wait
she
does
not
know
you
are
here
james
remain
outside
until
brett
returns
then
conduct
him
to
your
mistress
capella
tone
admitted
of
no
argument
nor
was
it
necessary
to
protest
brett
always
liked
people
to
talk
in
the
way
they
deemed
best
suited
to
their
own
interests
without
any
expostulation
therefore
he
followed
his
limping
host
into
a
luxuriously
furnished
capella
closed
the
door
and
placed
himself
gently
on
a
couch
does
your
friend
fight
he
said
fixing
his
dark
eyes
blazing
with
anger
intently
on
the
other
that
is
a
matter
on
which
your
opinion
would
probably
be
more
valuable
than
mine
spare
me
your
wit
you
know
well
what
i
mean
will
he
meet
me
on
the
continent
and
settle
our
quarrel
like
a
gentleman
not
like
a
hired
bravo
what
quarrel
brett
you
are
not
so
stupid
david
hume
notwithstanding
his
past
may
still
be
deemed
a
man
of
honour
in
some
respects
he
treated
me
grossly
this
morning
will
he
fight
me
or
must
i
treat
him
as
a
cur
brett
without
invitation
seated
himself
he
produced
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
adding
greatly
to
capella
irritation
by
his
provoking
calmness
really
he
said
at
last
you
amuse
me
silence
he
cried
imperatively
when
the
italian
would
have
broken
out
into
a
torrent
of
expostulations
listen
to
me
you
vain
fool
this
method
of
address
had
the
rare
merit
of
achieving
its
object
capella
was
reduced
to
a
condition
of
speechless
rage
you
consider
yourself
the
aggrieved
person
i
suppose
went
on
the
englishman
subsiding
into
a
state
of
contemptuous
placidity
you
neglect
your
wife
make
love
to
an
honourable
and
girl
stoop
to
the
use
of
unworthy
taunts
and
even
criminal
innuendos
lose
such
control
of
your
passion
as
to
lay
sacrilegious
hands
upon
helen
layton
and
yet
you
resent
the
punishment
administered
to
you
by
her
affianced
husband
were
i
a
surgeon
capella
i
might
take
an
anatomical
interest
in
your
brain
as
it
is
i
regard
you
as
a
psychological
study
in
blackguardism
do
you
understand
me
perfectly
you
have
not
yet
answered
my
question
will
hume
fight
i
should
say
that
nothing
would
give
him
greater
pleasure
then
you
will
arrange
this
matter
i
can
send
a
friend
to
you
and
if
you
do
i
will
send
the
police
to
you
thus
possibly
anticipating
matters
somewhat
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
my
sole
purpose
in
life
just
now
is
to
lay
hands
on
the
man
who
killed
sir
alan
until
that
end
is
achieved
i
will
take
good
care
that
your
crude
ideas
of
honour
are
dealt
with
as
they
were
by
the
toe
of
a
boot
capella
was
certainly
a
singular
person
he
listened
unmoved
to
threats
and
insults
he
gave
that
snarling
smile
of
his
and
toyed
impatiently
with
his
moustache
your
object
in
life
does
not
concern
me
your
courts
tried
their
best
to
hang
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
his
cousin
death
and
failed
i
take
it
you
decline
this
proffered
duel
yes
then
i
will
fight
david
hume
in
my
own
way
you
have
rejected
the
fair
alternative
on
his
behalf
caramba
we
shall
see
now
who
wins
he
will
never
marry
helen
what
did
you
mean
just
now
when
you
said
that
he
was
for
his
cousin
death
is
that
an
italian
way
of
describing
a
murder
capella
leaned
back
and
snarled
silently
again
it
was
a
pity
he
had
cultivated
that
trick
it
spoilt
an
otherwise
classically
regular
set
of
features
james
he
shouted
the
footman
entered
take
this
gentleman
to
your
mistress
i
have
done
with
him
for
the
present
james
said
brett
the
astonished
servant
led
him
along
a
corridor
and
knocked
at
a
door
hidden
by
a
silk
curtain
capella
rose
to
receive
her
visitor
she
was
very
pale
now
but
quite
calm
and
dignified
in
manner
davie
did
not
come
with
you
she
said
when
brett
was
seated
near
to
her
in
an
alcove
formed
by
an
oriel
window
no
he
is
with
miss
layton
ah
i
am
not
sorry
i
prefer
to
talk
with
you
alone
it
is
perhaps
better
your
cousin
is
impulsive
in
some
respects
though
enough
in
others
it
may
be
so
i
like
him
although
we
have
not
seen
much
of
each
other
since
we
were
children
i
knew
him
this
morning
principally
on
account
of
his
likeness
to
alan
but
you
are
his
friend
brett
and
i
can
discuss
with
you
matters
i
would
not
care
to
broach
with
him
he
is
with
helen
layton
now
you
say
yes
and
let
me
add
an
explanation
those
two
young
people
are
devoted
to
each
other
no
power
on
earth
could
separate
them
why
do
you
tell
me
that
because
i
think
you
wished
to
be
assured
of
it
you
are
clever
brett
if
you
can
interpret
a
criminal
designs
as
well
as
you
can
read
a
woman
heart
you
must
be
a
terror
to
a
slight
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
the
barrister
leaned
forward
his
hands
clasped
and
arms
resting
on
his
knees
i
have
just
seen
your
husband
he
said
she
exhibited
no
marked
sign
of
emotion
but
he
thought
he
detected
a
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
again
i
ask
she
exclaimed
why
do
you
tell
me
the
reason
is
obvious
you
ought
to
know
all
that
goes
on
there
was
a
quarrel
this
morning
between
him
and
david
hume
your
husband
wished
me
to
arrange
a
duel
i
promised
him
a
visit
from
the
police
if
i
heard
any
more
of
such
nonsense
a
duel
more
bloodshed
she
almost
whispered
do
not
have
any
alarm
for
either
of
them
they
are
quite
safe
i
will
guarantee
so
much
at
any
rate
but
your
husband
is
a
somewhat
curious
person
he
is
prone
to
strong
and
sudden
hatreds
and
attachments
margaret
pressed
her
hands
to
her
face
she
could
no
longer
bear
the
torture
of
quiescence
oh
what
shall
i
do
she
wailed
i
am
the
most
miserable
woman
in
england
and
i
might
have
been
the
happiest
why
are
you
miserable
mrs
capella
asked
brett
gently
i
can
not
tell
you
perhaps
it
is
owing
to
my
own
folly
are
you
sure
that
david
and
helen
intend
to
get
married
yes
then
for
heaven
sake
let
the
wedding
take
place
let
them
leave
beechcroft
and
its
associations
for
ever
that
can
not
be
until
hume
character
is
cleared
from
the
odium
attached
to
it
you
mean
my
brother
death
but
that
has
been
settled
by
the
courts
david
was
declared
guilty
surely
that
will
suffice
no
good
purpose
can
be
gained
by
reopening
an
inquiry
closed
by
the
law
i
think
you
are
a
little
unjust
to
your
cousin
in
this
matter
capella
he
and
his
future
wife
feel
very
grievously
the
slur
cast
upon
his
name
you
know
perfectly
well
that
if
half
the
people
in
this
county
were
asked
killed
sir
alan
they
would
say
hume
the
other
half
would
shake
their
heads
in
dubiety
and
prefer
not
to
be
on
visiting
terms
with
david
hume
and
his
wife
no
your
brother
was
killed
in
a
particularly
foul
way
he
died
needlessly
so
far
as
we
can
learn
his
death
should
be
avenged
and
this
can
only
be
done
by
tracking
his
murderer
and
ruthlessly
bringing
the
wretch
to
justice
are
not
these
your
own
sentiments
when
divested
of
all
conflicting
desires
brett
concluding
sentence
seemed
to
petrify
his
hearer
in
what
way
can
i
help
you
she
murmured
and
the
words
appeared
to
come
from
a
heart
of
stone
there
are
many
items
i
want
cleared
up
but
i
do
not
wish
to
distress
you
unduly
can
you
not
refer
me
to
your
solicitors
for
instance
i
imagine
they
will
be
able
to
answer
all
my
queries
no
i
prefer
to
deal
with
the
affair
myself
very
well
i
will
commence
with
you
personally
why
did
you
quarrel
with
your
brother
in
london
a
few
days
before
his
death
because
i
was
living
extravagantly
not
only
that
but
he
disapproved
of
my
manner
of
life
in
those
days
i
was
headstrong
and
wilful
i
loved
a
bohemian
existence
combined
with
absurd
luxury
or
rather
a
wildly
useless
expenditure
of
money
no
one
who
knows
me
now
could
picture
me
then
yet
now
i
am
good
and
unhappy
then
i
was
wicked
in
some
eyes
and
happy
strange
is
it
not
not
altogether
so
unusual
as
you
may
think
was
any
other
person
interested
in
what
i
may
term
the
result
of
the
dispute
between
your
brother
and
yourself
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
i
was
very
careless
in
money
matters
but
it
is
clear
that
the
curtailment
of
my
rate
of
living
from
to
per
annum
must
make
considerable
difference
to
all
connected
with
me
had
you
been
living
at
the
former
rate
yes
since
my
father
death
what
annoyed
alan
was
the
fact
that
i
had
borrowed
from
who
else
knew
of
your
disagreement
with
him
besides
these
and
his
solicitors
all
my
friends
i
used
to
laugh
at
his
serious
ways
when
i
older
and
much
more
experienced
in
some
respects
treated
life
as
a
tiresome
joke
but
none
of
my
friends
were
commissioned
to
murder
my
brother
so
that
i
might
obtain
the
estate
mr
brett
not
by
you
he
said
thoughtfully
he
knew
well
that
to
endeavour
to
get
margaret
to
implicate
her
husband
would
merely
render
her
an
active
opponent
she
loved
this
italian
scamp
she
was
profoundly
thankful
that
david
hume
had
come
back
to
claim
the
hand
of
helen
layton
the
woman
who
had
been
the
unwilling
object
of
capella
wayward
affections
she
would
be
only
too
glad
to
give
half
her
property
to
the
young
couple
if
they
would
settle
in
new
zealand
or
peru
far
from
beechcroft
yet
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
she
could
love
a
man
whom
she
suspected
of
murdering
her
brother
why
then
had
husband
and
wife
drifted
apart
assuredly
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
were
inextricably
mixed
where
did
you
marry
mr
capella
asked
brett
suddenly
at
naples
a
civil
ceremony
before
the
mayor
and
registered
by
the
british
consul
had
you
been
long
acquainted
i
met
him
oddly
enough
in
covent
garden
theatre
the
night
my
brother
was
killed
it
was
now
brett
turn
to
be
startled
are
you
quite
certain
of
this
he
asked
his
surprise
at
the
turn
taken
by
the
conversation
almost
throwing
him
off
his
guard
positive
were
you
led
to
believe
that
giovanni
was
the
murderer
her
voice
was
cold
impassive
marvellously
under

it
warned
him
threw
him
back
into
the
safe
r√¥le
of
hume
adviser
and
friend
i
am
led
to
believe
nothing
at
present
he
said
slowly
this
inquiry
is
as
yet
only
hours
old
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
seeking
information
when
i
am
gorged
with
facts
i
proceed
to
digest
them
well
what
i
tell
you
is
true
there
are
no
less
than
ten
people
all
living
i
have
no
doubt
who
can
testify
to
its
correctness
i
had
a
box
at
the
fancy
dress
ball
that
new
year
eve
i
invited
nine
guests
one
of
them
an
attach√©
at
the
italian
embassy
brought
giovanni
and
introduced
him
to
me
we
were
together
from
midnight
until
whilst
poor
alan
was
lying
here
dead
i
was
revelling
at
a
do
you
think
i
am
likely
to
forget
the
circumstances
the
icy
tones
thrilled
with
pitiful
remembrance
but
the
barrister
task
required
the
unsparing
use
of
the
probe
he
determined
once
and
for
all
to
end
an
unpleasant
scene
will
you
tell
me
why
you
and
your
husband
have
shall
we
say
disagreed
so
soon
after
your
marriage
you
were
formed
by
providence
and
nature
to
be
mated
what
has
driven
you
apart
the
woman
flushed
scarlet
under
this
direct
inquiry
i
can
not
tell
you
she
said
brokenly
but
the
cause
in
no
way
concerns
either
my
brother
death
or
david
innocence
it
is
personal
between
giovanni
and
myself
in
god
good
time
it
may
be
put
right
brett
singularly
enough
was
a
man
of
quick
impulse
he
was
moved
now
by
a
profound
pity
for
the
woman
who
thus
bared
her
heart
to
him
thank
you
for
your
candour
capella
he
exclaimed
with
a
fervour
that
evidently
touched
her
may
i
ask
one
more
question
and
i
have
done
with
a
most
unpleasant
ordeal
do
you
suspect
any
person
of
being
your
brother
assassin
no

revelations
hume
and
winter
did
not
meet
on
terms
that
might
be
strictly
described
as
cordial
brett
on
quitting
the
hall
had
surrendered
himself
to
a
spell
of
vacant
bewilderment
he
haled
the
unwilling
hume
from
helen
society
and
picked
up
the
detective
at
the
wheat
sheaf
inn
then
the
barrister
from
sheer
need
of
mental
relief
determined
to
have
some
fun
with
them
you
two
ought
to
know
each
other
he
said
at
one
time
you
took
keen
interest
in
matters
of
mutual
concern
allow
me
to
introduce
you
hume
this
is
winter
of
scotland
yard
david
was
quite
unprepared
for
the
meeting
what
he
exclaimed
his
upper
lip
stiffening
the
man
who
concocted
all
sorts
of
imaginary
evidence
against
me
is
not
the
right
word
nor
either
growled
winter
quite
right
said
brett
really
hume
you
should
be
more
careful
in
your
choice
of
language
had
winter
been
as
careless
in
his
statements
at
the
assizes
he
would
certainly
have
hanged
you
hume
was
too
happy
after
a
prolonged
with
his
beloved
to
harbour
malice
against
any
person
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
shake
hands
he
inquired
blandly
it
might
be
a
good
preliminary
to
a
better
understanding
of
one
another
you
think
winter
is
an
unscrupulous
ruffian
he
described
you
to
me
as
a
swine
not
two
hours
ago
now
you
are
both
wrong
winter
is
the
best
living
police
detective
and
a
most
one
he
will
be
a
valuable
ally
before
many
days
are
over
you
will
be
deeply
in
his
debt
in
every
sense
of
the
word
on
the
other
hand
you
hume
are
a
man
whom
winter
must
help
to
regain
his
rightful
position
this
is
one
of
the
occasions
when
justice
is
compelled
to
take
the
bandage
off
her
eyes
she
may
be
impartial
but
she
is
often
blind
now
be
friends
and
let
us
start
from
that
basis
silently
the
two
men
exchanged
a
hearty
grip
excellent
cried
the
barrister
hume
take
winter
with
you
in
front
i
will
seat
myself
beside
the
groom
and
please
oblige
me
both
of
you
by
not
addressing
a
word
to
me
between
here
and
stowmarket
hume
and
the
detective
got
along
comfortably
once
the
ice
was
broken
naturally
they
steered
clear
of
all
reference
to
the
tragedy
in
the
presence
of
the
servant
their
talk
dealt
chiefly
with
sporting
matters
brett
carried
swiftly
along
the
level
road
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
beechcroft
and
its
contiguous
hamlet
until
they
vanished
in
the
middle
distance
this
is
the
most
curious
inquiry
i
was
ever
engaged
in
he
communed
winter
of
course
will
fasten
on
to
capella
like
a
horse
leech
when
he
knows
the
facts
yet
capella
is
neither
a
coward
nor
an
ordinary
villain
for
some
ridiculous
reason
i
have
a
sneaking
sympathy
with
him
had
he
stormed
and
blustered
when
i
pitched
into
him
i
would
have
thought
less
of
him
and
his
wife
what
mysterious
workings
of
fate
brought
those
two
together
and
then
disunited
them
they
become
fascinated
one
with
the
other
whilst
the
brother
corpse
is
still
palpitating
beneath
that
terrible
stroke
they
get
married
with
not
unreasonable
haste
but
no
sooner
do
they
reach
beechcroft
a
house
of
evil
import
if
ever
bricks
and
mortar
had
such
a
character
than
they
are
driven
asunder
by
some
malign
influence
and
now
after
eighteen
months
i
am
asked
to
take
up
the
tangled
clues
if
such
may
be
said
to
exist
it
is
a
difficult
perhaps
an
impossible
undertaking
yet
if
i
have
done
so
much
in
a
day
what
may
not
happen
in
a
fortnight
long
afterwards
recalling
that
soliloquy
he
wondered
whether
or
not
were
he
suddenly
endowed
with
the
gift
of
prophecy
he
would
nevertheless
have
pursued
his
quest
he
never
could
tell
once
securely
entrenched
in
a
private
of
the
stowmarket
hotel
the
three
men
began
to
discuss
crime
and
tobacco
winter
commenced
by
being
confidential
and
professional
now
hume
he
said
as
misunderstandings
have
been
cleared
to
some
extent
by
brett
remarks
i
will
with
your
permission
ask
you
a
few
questions
fire
away
in
the
first
place
your
counsel
tried
to
prove
did
prove
in
fact
that
you
walked
straight
from
the
to
the
hall
sat
down
in
the
library
and
did
not
move
from
your
chair
until
fergusson
the
butler
told
you
how
he
had
found
sir
alan
body
on
the
lawn
exactly
so
if
a
man
comes
forward
now
and
swears
that
he
watched
you
for
nearly
ten
minutes
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
yews
on
the
left
of
the
house
he
will
not
be
telling
the
truth
that
is
putting
it
mildly
yet
there
is
such
a
witness
in
existence
and
i
am
certain
he
is
not
a
liar
in
this
matter
what
brett
and
hume
ejaculated
the
word
simultaneously
the
one
surprised
because
he
knew
how
careful
winter
was
in
matters
of
fact
the
other
indignant
at
the
seeming
disbelief
in
his
statement
please
gentlemen
appealed
the
detective
secretly
gratified
by
the
sensation
he
caused
wait
until
i
have
finished
if
i
did
not
fully
accept
brett
views
on
this
remarkable
case
i
would
not
be
sitting
here
this
minute
my
conscience
would
not
permit
it
be
virtuous
winter
but
not
too
virtuous
broke
in
brett
drily
there
you
go
again
sir
questioning
my
motives
but
i
am
of
a
forgiving
disposition
now
there
can
not
be
the
slightest
doubt
that
a
poacher
named
john
wise
better
known
as
jack
who
resides
in
this
town
chose
that
new
year
eve
as
an
excellent
time
to
net
the
meadows
behind
the
hall
he
had
heard
about
eastham
dance
and
knew
that
on
such
a
night
the
estate
keepers
would
have
more
liking
for
fun
with
the
coachmen
and
maids
than
for
he
entered
the
park
soon
after
midnight
and
saw
a
gentleman
walk
up
the
avenue
towards
the
house
he
waited
a
few
minutes
and
crept
quietly
along
the
side
of
the
hedge
in
the
park
of
course
being
winter
time
the
trees
and
bushes
were
bare
and
he
was
startled
to
see
the
same
gentleman
with
his
coat
buttoned
up
standing
in
the
shade
of
the
yews
close
to
the
hall
jack
naturally
thought
he
had
been
spotted
he
gripped
his
lurcher
collar
and
stood
still
for
nearly
ten
minutes
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
mistaken
he
had
not
been
seen
so
he
stole
off
towards
the
plantation
and
started
operations
he
is
a
poacher
and
always
works
alone
about
three
he
was
alarmed
by
a
policeman
lantern
the
search
of
the
grounds
after
the
murder
you
see
and
made
off
he
entered
stowmarket
on
the
far
side
of
the
town
and
ran
into
a
policeman
arms
they
fought
for
twenty
minutes
the
won
and
jack
got
six
months
hard
labour
for
being
in
unlawful
possession
of
game
and
assaulting
the
police
consequently
he
never
heard
a
syllable
about
the
mystery
as
this
affair
was
called
by
the
press
until
long
after
hume
second
trial
and
acquittal
yet
the
first
thing
jack
did
after
his
release
was
to
go
straight
to
the
police
and
tell
them
what
he
had
seen
i
think
hume
that
even
you
will
admit
a
good
deal
depended
on
the
result
of
the
fight
between
the
poacher
and
the
bobby
for
described
a
man
of
your
exact
appearance
and
dressed
as
you
were
that
night
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
when
winter
ended
his
recital
it
is
evident
said
brett
otherwise
engaged
in
making
that
jack
saw
the
real
murderer
a
man
like
me
in
evening
dress
who
on
earth
could
he
be
was
natural
exclamation
we
must
test
this
chap
story
said
brett
how
easily
enough
there
is
a
garden
outside
can
you
bring
this
human
bunny
here
i
think
so
very
well
stage
him
about
nine
anything
else
winter
pondered
a
little
while
then
he
addressed
hume
hesitatingly
does
brett
know
everything
that
happened
after
the
murder
i
think
so
yes
everything
say
of
an
hour
afterwards
the
effect
of
this
remark
on
hume
was
very
pronounced
his
habitual
air
of
reserve
gave
place
to
a
state
of
decided
confusion
what
are
you
hinting
at
he
cried
striving
hard
to
govern
his
voice
well
it
must
out
sooner
or
later
why
did
you
go
to
meet
miss
helen
layton
in
the
avenue
about
soon
after
sir
alan
body
had
been
examined
by
the
doctor
oh
damn
it
man
how
did
you
ascertain
that
groaned
hume
i
knew
it
all
along
but
i
did
not
see
that
it
was
very
material
to
the
case
and
i
wanted
to
keep
the
poor
young
lady
name
out
of
the
affair
as
far
as
possible
i
did
not
want
to
suggest
that
she
was
an
accessory
after
the
crime
hume
was
blushing
like
a
schoolboy
he
glanced
miserably
at
brett
but
the
barrister
was
still
puffing
artistic
designs
in
big
and
little
rings
very
well
my
reason
for
concealment
disappears
now
he
blurted
out
for
the
young
man
was
both
vexed
and
ashamed
that
wretched
night
after
she
returned
home
helen
thought
she
had
behaved
foolishly
in
creating
a
scene
she
put
on
a
cloak
changed
her
shoes
and
slipped
back
again
to
eastham
where
she
met
alan
just
coming
away
she
implored
him
to
make
up
the
quarrel
with
me
he
apologised
for
his
conduct
and
promised
to
do
the
same
to
me
when
we
met
he
explained
that
other
matters
had
upset
his
temper
that
day
and
he
had
momentarily
yielded
to
an
irritated
belief
that
everything
was
against
him
helen
watched
him
enter
the
park
she
pretended
that
she
was
going
in
to
eastham
she
could
see
the
lighted
windows
of
the
library
and
she
wondered
why
he
did
not
go
inside
but
imagined
that
at
the
distance
she
might
easily
be
mistaken
at
last
she
ran
off
to
the
rectory
again
she
lingered
in
the
garden
devoutly
wishing
that
all
might
be
well
between
alan
and
me
then
she
became
conscious
that
something
unusual
had
taken
place
owing
to
the
lights
and
commotion
for
a
long
time
she
was
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
what
could
have
happened
at
last
yielding
to
curiosity
she
came
back
to
the
lodge
the
gates
were
wide
open
eastham
dance
was
still
in
progress
she
is
not
a
timid
girl
so
she
walked
boldly
up
the
avenue
until
she
met
fergusson
the
butler
who
was
then
going
to
tell
eastham
when
she
heard
his
story
she
was
too
shocked
to
credit
it
and
asked
him
to
bring
me
i
came
by
that
time
i
was
beginning
to
realise
that
i
might
be
implicated
in
the
affair
and
i
begged
her
to
return
home
at
once
alone
she
did
so
subsequently
she
asked
me
not
to
refer
to
the
escapade
for
obvious
reasons
it
was
a
woman
little
secret
brett
and
i
was
compelled
to
keep
it
anything
else
winter
demanded
the
barrister
wrapped
in
a
cloud
of
his
own
creation
that
is
all
sir
except
the
way
in
which
i
heard
of
miss
meeting
with
mr
hume
not
through
fergusson
eh
not
a
bit
the
old
chap
is
as
close
as
wax
he
seems
to
think
that
a
must
die
a
violent
death
outside
that
library
window
and
if
the
cause
of
the
trouble
is
another
it
is
their
own
blooming
business
and
no
other
person
most
extraordinary
old
chap
have
you
met
him
no
indeed
i
am
only
just
beginning
to
hear
the
correct
details
of
the
story
hume
winced
but
passed
no
remark
well
my
information
came
through
an
anonymous
letter
you
do
say
so
how
interesting
have
you
got
it
i
brought
it
with
me
for
a
reason
other
than
that
which
actuates
me
now
i
must
confess
he
produced
a
small
envelope
frayed
at
the
edges
and
closely
compressed
it
bore
the
address
police
office
scotland
yard
and
the
postal
stamp
was
west
strand
january
within
a
small
slip
of
paper
also
typed
gave
this
message
about
stowmarket
david
hume
frazer
killed
cousin
cousin
talked
girl
in
road
girl
waited
wood
david
hume
frazer
met
girl
in
wood
after
brett
jumped
up
in
instant
excitement
ha
placed
the
two
documents
on
a
table
near
the
window
where
the
afternoon
sun
fell
directly
on
them
written
by
the
murderer
he
cried
the
result
of
perusing
the
evening
papers
containing
a
report
of
the
first
proceedings
before
the
magistrates
the
production
of
an
illiterate
man
who
knew
neither
the
use
of
a
hyphen
nor
the
correct
word
to
describe
the
avenue
not
wholly
exact
either
if
your
story
be
true
hume
my
story
is
true
helen
herself
will
tell
it
you
word
for
word
this
is
most
important
look
at
that
broken
small
and
the
bent
capital
the
letter
too
is
out
of
gear
and
does
not
register
accurately
do
you
note
the
irregular
spacing
in
you
got
that
letter
winter
and
yet
you
did
not
test
every
remington
in
london
oh
of
course
it
my
fault
winter
has
fallen
on
himself
and
he
knew
it
oh
winter
winter
come
to
me
twice
a
week
from
six
to
seven
tuesdays
and
fridays
and
i
will
give
you
a
training
now
i
wonder
if
that
has
been
repaired
the
detective
had
seldom
seen
brett
so
thoroughly
roused
his
eyes
were
brilliant
his
nose
dilated
as
if
he
could
smell
the
very
scent
of
the
anonymous
scribe
an
illiterate
man
he
repeated
in
evening
dress
the
same
height
and
appearance
as
hume
in
a
village
like
sleagill
on
a
new
year
eve
four
miles
from
everywhere
was
ever
clue
so
simple
provided
by
a
careless
scoundrel
and
eighteen
months
have
elapsed
this
is
positively
maddening
look
here
old
chap
said
hume
still
smarting
under
the
recollections
of
brett
caustic
utterance
say
you
forgive
me
for
keeping
that
thing
back
there
is
nothing
else
believe
me
it
was
for
helen
sake
rubbish
cried
the
barrister
the
only
wonder
is
that
you
are
not
long
since
assimilated
in
quicklime
in
a
prison
grave
you
are
all
cracked
i
think
living
spooks
human
march
hares
as
for
you
winter
i
weep
for
you
he
strode
rapidly
to
and
fro
along
the
length
of
the
room
smoking
prodigiously
with
frowning
brows
and
concentrated
eyes
the
others
did
not
speak
but
winter
treated
hume
to
an
informing
wink
as
one
might
say
now
you
will
hear
something
chapter
ix
the
thinking
aloud
rather
than
addressing
his
companions
brett
began
again
the
man
must
have
had
some
place
in
which
to
change
his
clothes
for
he
would
not
court
attention
by
walking
about
in
evening
dress
by
broad
daylight
he
met
and
spoke
with
alan
that
afternoon
the
result
was
unsatisfactory
the
stranger
resolved
to
visit
him
again
at
night
the
night
of
the
ball
in
a
country
village
on
such
an
occasion
a
coat
was
a
as
many
gentry
had
come
in
from
the
surrounding
district
yes
that
is
so
broke
in
hume
brett
momentarily
looked
through
him
and
the
detective
shook
his
head
to
deprecate
any
further
interruption
he
could
not
enter
eastham
house
for
there
everybody
knew
everybody
else
he
could
not
enter
the
library
of
the
hall
because
the
footman
was
on
duty
for
several
hours
is
not
that
so
he
seemed
to
bite
both
men
with
the
question
yes
they
answered
then
he
was
compelled
to
hang
about
the
avenue
watching
his
opportunity
his
opportunity
for
what
not
to
commit
a
murder
he
was
unarmed
or
at
any
rate
his
implement
was
a
haphazard
choice
selected
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
saw
david
hume
leave
the
dance
and
watched
his
brief
talk
with
the
butler
he
correctly
interpreted
preparations
to
await
his
cousin
arrival
did
hume
sleepiness
suggest
the
crime
and
its
probable
explanation
perhaps
i
can
not
determine
that
point
now
assuredly
it
gave
the
opportunity
to
commit
a
theft
something
was
stolen
from
the
secretaire
a
bold
rascal
to
force
a
drawer
whilst
another
man
was
in
the
room
did
he
fear
the
consequences
if
he
were
caught
i
think
not
he
succeeded
in
his
object
and
went
off
but
before
he
reached
the
gates
he
saw
miss
layton
whom
he
did
not
know
talking
to
the
baronet
he
secreted
himself
until
the
baronet
entered
the
park
alone
for
some
reason
he
made
his
presence
known
and
walked
with
sir
alan
to
the
lawn
outside
the
window
still
retaining
in
his
hand
the
small
knife
used
to
prise
open
the
lock
there
was
a
short
and
vehement
dispute
possibly
the
baronet
guessed
the
object
of
this
unexpected
appearance
there
may
have
been
a
struggle
then
the
knife
was
sent
home
with
such
singular
skill
that
the
victim
fell
without
a
word
a
groan
to
arouse
attention
the
murderer
made
off
down
the
avenue
but
he
was
far
too
to
run
away
and
encounter
unforeseen
dangers
no
he
waited
among
the
trees
to
ascertain
what
would
happen
when
his
victim
was
discovered
and
frame
his
plans
accordingly
it
was
then
that
he
saw
helen
layton
and
david
hume
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
murder
spread
abroad
the
dance
broke
up
amidst
the
wondering
crowd
slowly
dispersing
in
their
carriages
he
could
easily
slip
away
unseen
for
the
police
of
course
were
sure
that
david
hume
killed
his
cousin
do
you
see
winter
the
inspector
did
not
see
you
are
making
up
a
fine
tale
brett
he
said
doggedly
but
blessed
if
i
can
follow
your
reasoning
no
of
course
not
eighteen
months
of
settled
conviction
are
not
to
be
dispelled
in
an
instant
but
accept
my
theory
this
man
the
guilty
man
must
have
resided
in
stowmarket
for
some
hours
if
not
days
many
people
saw
him
he
could
not
live
in
sleagill
where
even
the
village
dogs
would
suspect
him
but
the
police
ready
to
handcuff
david
hume
never
thought
of
inquiring
about
strangers
who
came
and
went
at
stowmarket
in
those
days
stowmarket
is
a
metropolis
a
wilderness
of
changeful
beings
to
a
country
policeman
it
has
a
an
occasional
drunken
man
life
is
a
whirl
in
stowmarket
fortunately
people
have
memories
at
that
time
you
did
not
wear
a
beard
hume
no
was
the
reply
though
i
never
told
you
that
of
course
you
told
me
many
times
did
not
your
acquaintances
fail
to
recognise
you
had
not
capella
to
look
twice
at
you
before
she
knew
you
now
winter
start
out
ascertain
in
each
hotel
in
the
town
if
they
had
any
strange
guests
about
the
period
of
the
murder
there
is
a
remote
chance
that
you
may
learn
something
describe
hume
without
a
beard
and
hint
at
a
reward
if
information
is
forthcoming
money
quickens
the
agricultural
intellect
the
detective
doubting
much
obeyed
hume
asking
if
there
was
any
reason
why
he
should
not
drive
back
to
sleagill
for
an
hour
before
dinner
was
sarcastically
advised
to
go
a
good
deal
farther
indeed
the
sight
of
that
tiny
slip
had
stirred
brett
to
volcanic
activity
he
tramped
backwards
and
forwards
enveloped
in
smoke
once
he
halted
and
tore
at
the
bell
a
waiter
came
go
to
my
room
no
and
bring
me
a
leather
marked
run
i
give
you
twenty
seconds
after
that
you
lose
sixpence
a
second
out
of
your
tip
he
pulled
out
his
watch
the
man
dashed
along
the
corridor
much
to
the
amazement
of
a
passing
he
returned
bearing
the
bag
in
triumph
seventeen
seconds
by
the
law
of
equity
you
are
entitled
to
eighteenpence
brett
produced
the
money
and
led
the
gaping
waiter
out
of
the
room
promptly
shutting
the
door
on
him
he
a
rum
gentleman
that
said
the
waiter
to
the
girl
he
must
be
to
make
you
hurry
in
such
fashion
why
you
would
have
gone
faster
for
a
free
pint
i
consider
that
an
impertinent
observation
with
tilted
nose
the
man
turned
and
cannoned
against
hume
here
cried
the
latter
run
to
the
stables
and
get
me
a
horse
and
trap
if
they
are
ready
in
two
minutes
i
give
you
two
shillings
talk
about
makin
money
gasped
the
waiter
as
he
flew
downstairs
this
is
coinin
but
by
gum
they
in
a
hurry
brett
unlocked
his
bag
and
took
from
it
the
book
of
newspaper
cuttings
ah
he
said
after
a
rapid
glance
at
his
concluding
notes
i
thought
so
here
is
what
i
wrote
when
the
affair
was
fresh
in
my
mind
were
no
inquiries
made
at
stowmarket
to
learn
what
if
any
strangers
were
in
the
town
on
new
year
eve
minute
investigations
should
be
pursued
with
reference
to
margaret
friends
and
associates
fergusson
ever
been
asked
if
his
master
received
any
visitors
on
the
day
of
the
murder
or
during
the
preceding
week
if
so
who
were
they
what
is
the
precise
purpose
of
the
knife
attached
to
the
japanese
sword
it
appears
to
be
too
small
to
be
used
as
a
dagger
in
any
case
the
sword
scabbard
would
be
an
unsuitable
place
to
carry
an
auxiliary
weapon
to
european
ideas
now
i
wonder
if
fergusson
is
still
at
the
hall
the
other
matters
must
wait
winter
returned
about
the
same
time
as
hume
brett
and
the
latter
dressed
for
dinner
and
the
adroit
detective
not
to
be
beaten
borrowed
a
from
the
landlord
after
telegraphing
to
london
for
his
own
clothes
during
the
progress
of
the
meal
the
little
party
scrupulously
refrained
from
discussing
business
an
excellent
habit
always
insisted
on
by
brett
they
had
reached
the
stage
of
coffee
and
cigars
when
a
waiter
entered
and
whispered
something
to
the
police
officer
jack
is
here
exclaimed
winter
capital
tell
him
to
wait
when
the
servant
had
left
brett
detailed
his
proposed
test
he
and
hume
would
go
into
the
hotel
garden
after
donning
overcoats
and
hats
for
hume
told
him
that
both
his
cousin
and
he
himself
had
worn
that
style
of
headgear
they
would
stand
with
their
faces
hidden
beneath
the
trees
and
winter
was
to
bring
the
poacher
towards
them
after
asking
him
to
pick
out
the
man
who
most
resembled
the
person
he
had
seen
standing
in
the
avenue
at
beechcroft
the
test
was
most
successful
rabbit
jack
instantly
selected
hume
it
either
the
chap
hisself
or
his
dead
spit
was
the
poacher
dictum
then
he
was
cautioned
to
keep
his
own
counsel
as
to
the
incident
and
he
went
away
to
get
gloriously
drunk
on
in
the
seclusion
of
the
winter
related
the
outcome
of
his
inquiries
they
were
negative
landlords
and
barmaids
remembered
a
few
commercial
travellers
by
referring
to
old
lodgers
but
they
one
and
all
united
in
the
opinion
that
new
eve
was
a
most
unlikely
time
for
the
hotels
to
contain
casual
visitors
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
a
chase
from
the
start
opined
winter
obviously
replied
brett
yet
ten
minutes
ago
you
produced
a
man
who
actually
watched
the
murderer
for
a
considerable
time
that
night
whilst
winter
was
searching
his
wits
for
a
suitable
argument
the
barrister
continued
where
is
fergusson
now
i
can
answer
that
exclaimed
hume
he
is
my
father
butler
when
capella
came
to
beechcroft
the
old
man
wrote
and
said
he
could
not
take
orders
from
an
italian
it
was
like
receiving
instructions
from
a
french
cook
so
my
father
brought
him
to
glen
tochan
then
your
father
must
send
him
to
london
he
may
be
very
useful
i
understand
he
was
very
many
years
at
beechcroft
man
and
boy
as
he
puts
it
write
and
bring
him
to
town
he
can
stay
at
your
hotel
i
will
not
keep
him
long
just
one
conversation
no
more
can
you
or
your
father
tell
me
anything
else
about
that
sword
i
fear
not
admiral
cunningham
i
guess
i
the
authority
there
broke
in
winter
i
got
to
know
all
about
it
from
mr
okasaki
and
who
pray
is
mr
okasaki
a
japanese
gentleman
who
came
to
ipswich
to
hear
the
first
trial
he
was
interested
in
the
case
owing
to
the
curious
fact
that
a
murder
in
a
little
english
village
should
be
committed
with
such
a
weapon
so
he
came
down
to
listen
to
the
evidence
and
by
the
way
he
took
a
barmaid
back
with
him
there
was
rather
a
sensation
the
japs
are
very
enterprising
what
did
he
tell
you
about
the
sword
the
detective
produced
a
it
is
all
here
he
said
turning
over
the
leaves
a
japanese
samurai
or
gentleman
in
former
days
carried
two
swords
one
long
blade
for
use
against
his
enemies
and
a
shorter
one
for
committing
suicide
if
he
was
beaten
or
disgraced
the
sword
hume
gave
his
cousin
was
a
short
one
and
the
knife
which
accompanied
it
is
called
the
or
little
sword
as
well
as
i
could
understand
okasaki
a
jap
uses
this
as
a
and
also
as
a
queer
sort
of
if
he
slays
an
enemy
he
sticks
the
between
the
other
fellow
ribs
or
into
his
ear
and
leaves
it
there
a
card
in
fact
you
always
have
some
joke
against
the
growled
the
detective
i
never
you
have
just
made
a
most
excellent
one
yourself
please
continue
winter
your
researches
are
valuable
that
is
all
would
you
like
to
see
the
that
killed
sir
alan
yes
where
is
it
in
the
black
museum
at
scotland
yard
i
will
take
you
there
thank
you
by
the
way
concerning
this
man
okasaki
supposing
we
should
want
any
further
information
from
him
on
this
curious
topic
can
you
find
him
you
say
he
indulged
in
some
liaison
with
an
ipswich
girl
so
i
assume
he
has
not
gone
back
to
japan
the
last
i
heard
of
him
was
at
that
time
some
one
told
me
that
he
was
an
independent
gentleman
noted
for
his
art
tastes
the
disappearance
of
the
girl
created
a
rare
old
row
in
ipswich
make
a
note
of
him
we
may
need
his
skilled
assistance
was
there
any
special
design
on
the
it
was
ornamented
in
some
way
but
i
forget
the
pattern
i
can
help
you
in
that
matter
said
hume
i
remember
perfectly
that
the
handle
of
polished
bore
a
beautiful
embossed
design
in
gold
and
silver
of
a
setting
sun
surmounted
by
clouds
and
two
birds
correct
hume
i
recall
it
now
said
the
detective
the
same
thing
appears
on
the
handle
of
the
sword
brett
ruminated
silently
on
this
fresh
information
like
the
other
pieces
in
the
puzzle
it
seemed
to
have
no
sort
of
connection
with
the
cause
of
the
crime
why
do
you
say
sun
how
does
one
distinguish
it
from
the
rising
sun
in
embossed
or
inlaid
work
he
asked
hume
i
do
not
know
i
only
repeat
alan
remark
i
gave
the
beastly
thing
to
him
because
he
became
interested
in
japanese
arms
during
his
eastern
tour
you
will
recollect
ah
well
that
is
a
nice
point
for
okasaki
to
settle
if
we
chance
to
come
across
him
do
forget
winter
i
want
to
see
that
whom
did
you
meet
at
sleagill
hume
the
young
man
laughed
helen
of
course
any
other
person
no
i
told
her
i
might
chance
to
drive
out
in
that
direction
about
five
so
dear
me
you
were
not
at
all
certain
by
no
means
i
am
at
your
orders
excellent
then
my
orders
are
that
you
shall
meet
the
young
lady
on
every
possible
occasion
you
took
her
for
a
drive
well
er
yes
i
did
you
do
not
leave
me
much
to
tell
did
she
say
anything
of
importance
bearing
upon
our
inquiry
i
mean
nothing
she
had
not
quitted
the
rectory
since
we
came
away
i
asked
her
to
pick
up
any
village
gossip
about
the
people
at
the
hall
and
let
us
know
at
the
earliest
moment
if
she
regarded
it
as
valuable
in
any
way
that
was
thoughtful
of
you
a
great
deal
may
happen
there
at
any
moment
a
waiter
knocked
and
entered
he
handed
a
letter
to
hume
from
nellie
said
david
hastily
he
opened
the
envelope
and
perused
a
short
note
which
he
gave
to
brett
it
ran
dearest
i
have
just
heard
from
jane
our
that
capella
is
leaving
the
hall
for
london
by
an
early
train
jane
out
with
capella
valet
and
is
in
tears
tell
brett
i
am
going
to
help
eastham
to
select
prize
books
for
the
school
treat
at
with
love
yours
nellie
who
brought
this
note
inquired
hume
from
the
waiter
as
he
picked
up
pen
and
paper
a
man
from
sleagill
sir
any
reply
certainly
tell
him
to
wait
in
the
at
my
expense
he
commenced
to
write
any
message
he
asked
brett
yes
give
miss
layton
my
compliments
and
say
i
regret
to
hear
that
jane
is
in
tears
ask
her
miss
layton
to
get
jane
to
find
out
from
the
valet
what
train
his
master
will
travel
by
why
because
i
will
go
by
an
earlier
one
if
possible
but
what
about
me
confound
it
i
promised
to
meet
miss
layton
at
eleven
do
so
my
dear
fellow
but
come
to
town
evening
winter
and
i
may
want
you
so
the
detective
sent
another
telegram
to
detain
that
dress
suit
and
hume
seemed
to
have
quickly
conquered
his
disinclination
to
visit
stowmarket
chapter
x
the
black
museum
winter
who
had
never
seen
capella
was
so
well
posted
by
brett
as
to
his
personal
appearance
that
he
experienced
no
difficulty
in
picking
out
the
italian
when
he
alighted
from
the
train
at
liverpool
street
station
next
morning
capella
did
not
conduct
himself
like
a
furtive
villain
he
jumped
into
a
hansom
his
valet
followed
in
a
with
the
luggage
in
each
instance
the
address
given
to
the
driver
was
that
of
a
west
end
hotel
the
detective
cab
kept
pace
with
capella
through
old
broad
street
queen
victoria
street
and
along
the
embankment
at
the
mansion
house
and
again
at
blackfriars
they
halted
side
by
side
and
winter
noticed
that
his
quarry
was
looking
into
space
with
sullen
vindictive
eyes
he
means
mischief
to
somebody
was
winter
summing
up
i
wonder
if
he
intends
to
knife
hume
for
brett
had
given
his
professional
a
synopsis
of
all
that
happened
before
they
met
and
of
his
subsequent
conversation
with
the
happy
couple
in
beechcroft
hall
he
repeated
this
remark
to
the
barrister
when
he
reached
brett
chambers
capella
will
do
nothing
so
crude
was
the
comment
he
is
no
fool
i
do
not
credit
him
with
the
murder
of
sir
alan
but
if
i
am
mistaken
in
this
respect
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
he
can
dream
of
clearing
his
path
again
by
the
same
drastic
method
of
course
he
means
mischief
but
he
will
stab
reputations
not
individuals
when
will
you
come
to
the
black
museum
at
once
if
you
like
but
before
we
set
out
i
want
to
discuss
okasaki
with
you
what
sort
of
person
is
he
a
genuine
jap
small
lively
and
his
eyes
are
like
tiny
slits
in
a
water
melon
and
when
he
laughs
his
grin
goes
back
to
his
ears
really
winter
i
did
not
credit
you
with
such
a
fund
of
picturesque
imagery
would
you
know
him
again
i
ca
be
certain
all
japs
are
very
much
alike
to
my
thinking
but
if
i
heard
him
talk
i
would
be
almost
sure
why
do
you
ask
because
i
have
been
looking
up
a
little
information
with
reference
to
the
and
its
uses
now
okasaki
is
the
name
of
a
japanese
town
family
names
almost
invariably
have
a
topographical
foundation
referring
to
some
village
river
street
or
mountain
and
there
may
be
thousands
of
okasakis
then
again
it
was
the
custom
some
years
ago
for
a
man
to
be
called
one
name
at
birth
another
when
he
came
of
age
a
third
when
he
obtained
some
official
position
and
so
on
for
instance
you
would
be
called
spring
when
you
were
born
summer
when
you
were
autumn
when
you
became
a
policeman
and
winter
when
you
reached
your
present
rank
oh
christopher
cried
the
detective
and
if
i
were
made
chief
inspector
then
your
title
would
be
dog
or
something
of
the
sort
winter
assimilated
the
foregoing
information
with
a
profound
thankfulness
that
we
in
england
do
these
things
differently
why
are
you
so
interested
in
mr
okasaki
he
inquired
i
will
answer
your
question
by
another
why
was
he
so
interested
in
the
that
is
hardly
what
i
told
you
brett
he
professed
to
be
interested
in
the
crime
itself
but
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
he
did
ask
me
to
let
him
see
the
thing
and
did
you
yes
i
wanted
all
the
information
i
could
get
my
position
exactly
let
us
go
to
scotland
yard
the
famous
black
museum
has
so
often
been
the
subject
of
articles
in
the
public
press
that
no
detailed
description
is
needed
here
it
contains
in
glass
cases
or
hanging
on
the
walls
a
weird
collection
of
articles
famous
in
the
annals
of
crime
it
is
not
open
to
the
public
and
brett
who
had
not
seen
the
place
before
examined
its
relics
with
much
curiosity
the
detective
exhibited
a
pardonable
pride
in
some
of
them
but
his
companion
damped
his
enthusiasm
by
saying
this
is
a
depressing
sight
in
what
way
british
rogues
are
evidently
of
low
intelligence
in
the
average
a
bludgeon
and
a
halter
make
up
their
history
there
more
than
that
in
a
good
many
cases
ah
i
forgot
the
handcuffs
well
here
is
the
said
winter
shortly
the
barrister
took
the
fateful
weapon
not
more
deadly
than
a
in
appearance
and
scrutinised
it
closely
it
has
not
been
cleaned
he
said
no
it
was
left
untouched
after
the
doctor
withdrew
it
from
the
poor
young
fellow
breast
brett
produced
a
magnifying
glass
beneath
the
rust
on
the
blade
he
thought
he
could
distinguish
some
japanese
characters
in
the
quaint
pictorial
script
adapted
by
that
singular
people
from
the
chinese
system
of
writing
he
brought
the
knife
nearer
to
the
window
and
carefully
focussed
it
then
he
produced
a
and
made
a
pencil
drawing
of
the
following
inscription
illustration
winter
watched
him
with
quiet
agony
he
had
never
noticed
the
signs
before
okasaki
did
not
tell
you
what
these
scratches
meant
inquired
the
barrister
no
he
did
not
see
them
sure
quite
positive
of
course
it
is
very
smart
on
your
part
to
hit
upon
them
so
quickly
but
what
possible
purpose
can
it
serve
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
something
carved
in
japan
more
than
fifty
years
ago
at
the
very
least
i
do
not
know
it
is
very
stupid
of
me
i
admit
but
i
have
not
the
faintest
notion
does
it
make
the
finding
of
okasaki
more
important
to
a
certain
extent
we
want
to
have
everything
explained
at
present
we
have
so
little
of
what
i
regard
as
really
definite
evidence
may
i
ask
what
that
little
is
sir
alan
was
murdered
with
a
knife
produced
by
a
man
like
david
hume
whom
jack
saw
standing
beneath
the
yews
not
much
eh
winter
shook
his
head
dubiously
if
sir
alan
were
shot
instead
of
stabbed
went
on
the
barrister
the
first
thing
you
would
endeavour
to
determine
would
be
the
calibre
and
nature
of
the
bullet
why
not
be
equally
particular
about
the
knife
but
this
weapon
has
been
for
fifty
years
in
glen
tochan
its
history
is
thoroughly
established
is
it
who
made
it
whose
crest
does
it
bear
what
does
this
motto
signify
if
you
wanted
to
kill
a
man
would
you
use
this
toy
why
was
not
the
sword
itself
employed
that
string
of
questions
leaves
me
out
mr
brett
i
am
equally
uninformed
i
can
only
answer
the
last
one
the
sword
is
intended
for
suicidal
purposes
the
for
an
enemy
this
is
a
case
of
murder
not
suicide
the
detective
wheeled
sharply
on
his
heels
thereby
upsetting
charles
peace
telescopic
ladder
you
suspect
okasaki
he
cried
my
dear
fellow
okasaki
is
say
five
feet
nothing
the
murderer
is
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
japanese
are
clever
people
but
they
are
not
telescopes
and
he
picked
up
the
ladder
winter
grinned
you
always
make
capital
out
of
my
blunders
he
said
pooh
my
banking
account
is
limited
let
us
go
the
moral
atmosphere
in
this
room
is
vile
outside
the
central
police
office
they
separated
brett
to
pay
some
calls
winter
to
hunt
up
capella
movements
and
initiate
inquiries
about
okasaki
the
detective
came
to
brett
chambers
at
five
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
thank
goodness
you
are
at
home
sir
he
cried
when
smith
admitted
him
to
the
barrister
sanctum
capella
is
off
to
naples
naples
the
scene
of
his
marriage
what
did
this
journey
portend
naught
but
the
gravest
considerations
would
take
him
so
far
away
from
home
when
he
knew
that
david
and
helen
were
reunited
how
did
you
discover
this
fact
asked
brett
awaking
out
of
a
brown
study
easily
enough
as
it
happened
per
cent
of
valets
are
keen
sports
barbers
and
run
them
close
i
do
a
bit
that
way
myself
the
barrister
groaned
not
often
sir
but
this
is
holiday
time
you
see
anyhow
i
gave
the
whom
i
know
the
wink
to
come
to
a
neighbouring
bar
during
his
time
off
for
tea
he
actually
brought
capella
man
william
his
name
is
with
him
i
told
them
i
had
backed
the
first
winner
an
eight
to
one
chance
and
that
started
them
i
offered
to
put
them
on
a
certainty
next
week
and
william
face
fell
a
beastly
nuisance
he
said
off
to
naples
with
my
boss
said
i
you
not
going
before
the
night
train
perhaps
i
may
be
able
but
that
made
him
worse
because
they
leave
by
the
victoria
brett
began
to
pace
the
room
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
visit
naples
in
person
for
one
thing
he
did
not
speak
italian
but
capella
must
be
followed
at
last
he
decided
upon
a
course
of
action
winter
he
said
do
you
know
a
man
we
can
trust
an
italian
or
better
still
an
englishman
who
can
undertake
this
commission
for
us
would
you
mind
ringing
for
smith
sir
replied
the
detective
who
seemed
to
be
mightily
pleased
with
himself
smith
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
you
will
find
a
gentleman
named
holden
said
winter
ask
him
to
come
up
please
holden
appeared
a
sallow
personage
and
the
detective
explained
that
holden
was
an
sergeant
retained
for
many
years
at
headquarters
on
account
of
his
fluency
in
the
language
of
tasso
winter
did
not
mention
tasso
this
is
figurative
an
arrangement
was
quickly
made
he
was
to
start
that
evening
and
meet
capella
on
arrival
at
naples
winter
would
telegraph
the
fact
of
the
italian
departure
according
to
programme
holden
was
not
to
spare
expense
in
employing
local
assistance
if
necessary
he
was
to
report
everything
he
could
learn
about
capella
movements
brett
wanted
to
hand
him
but
found
that
all
the
money
he
had
in
his
possession
at
the
moment
only
totalled
up
to
winter
produced
a
small
bag
it
was
quite
true
what
i
said
he
smirked
i
did
back
the
first
winner
and
what
more
i
drew
it
sixteen
of
the
best
i
had
no
idea
the
police
force
was
so
corrupt
sighed
brett
as
he
completed
the
financial
transaction
and
holden
took
his
departure
the
detective
also
went
off
to
search
for
okasaki
about
nine
hume
arrived
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
he
said
that
the
rector
invited
me
to
lunch
he
approves
of
my
project
and
will
pray
for
my
success
it
has
been
a
most
pleasant
day
for
me
i
can
assure
you
the
rector
retired
to
his
study
immediately
after
lunch
i
presume
yes
said
david
innocently
has
anything
important
occurred
in
town
brett
gave
him
a
resum√©
of
events
a
chance
allusion
to
sir
alan
caused
the
young
man
to
exclaim
by
the
way
you
have
never
seen
his
photograph
he
and
i
were
very
much
alike
you
know
and
i
have
brought
from
my
rooms
a
few
pictures
which
may
interest
you
he
handed
to
brett
photographs
of
himself
and
his
two
cousins
and
of
the
older
sir
alan
and
lady
taken
singly
and
in
groups
the
barrister
examined
them
minutely
alan
and
i
pointed
out
his
client
were
photographed
during
our
last
visit
to
london
poor
chap
he
never
saw
this
picture
the
proofs
were
not
sent
until
after
his
death
something
seemed
to
puzzle
brett
very
considerably
he
compared
the
pictures
one
with
the
other
and
paid
heed
to
every
detail
let
me
understand
brett
said
at
last
i
think
i
have
it
in
my
notes
that
at
the
time
of
the
murder
you
were
sir
alan
and
capella
that
is
so
approximately
we
were
born
respectively
in
january
october
and
december
my
birthday
fell
on
the
stated
exactly
you
were
two
years
and
nine
months
older
than
he
yes
you
do
look
it
i
never
did
we
were
always
about
the
same
size
as
boys
but
he
matured
at
an
earlier
age
than
i
it
is
odd
how
old
were
you
when
this
group
was
taken
the
photograph
depicted
a
family
gathering
on
the
lawn
at
beechcroft
there
were
eight
persons
in
it
three
being
elderly
men
david
reflected
that
was
before
i
left
harrow
and
christmas
time
seventeen
almost
within
a
couple
of
weeks
so
your
cousin
margaret
was
sixteen
yes
she
was
remarkably
tall
for
her
age
that
was
a
notable
characteristic
from
an
early
age
we
boys
used
to
call
her
when
we
wanted
to
vex
her
the
three
old
gentlemen
are
very
much
alike
this
is
the
baronet
who
are
the
others
my
father
and
uncle
what
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
is
another
branch
of
the
family
well
yes
in
a
sense
my
uncle
is
dead
his
son
my
age
or
a
little
older
for
the
youngest
of
the
three
brothers
was
married
first
was
last
heard
of
in
argentina
brett
threw
the
photograph
down
with
clatter
good
heavens
he
vociferated
when
shall
i
begin
to
comprehend
this
business
in
its
entirety
how
many
more
uncles
and
aunts
and
cousins
have
you
amazed
by
this
outburst
hume
endeavoured
to
put
matters
right
i
never
thought
he
commenced
you
come
to
me
to
do
the
thinking
hume
for
goodness
sake
switch
your
memory
for
five
minutes
from
miss
layton
and
tell
me
all
you
know
of
your
family
history
have
you
any
other
relations
none
whatever
and
this
cousin
what
of
him
he
was
in
the
navy
and
being
of
a
quarrelsome
disposition
was
for
some
small
outbreak
he
would
not
submit
to
discipline
and
resigned
the
service
then
his
father
died
and
bob
went
off
to
south
america
i
have
never
heard
of
him
since
i
know
very
little
about
my
younger
uncle
household
indeed
the
occasion
recorded
by
the
photograph
was
the
last
time
the
old
men
met
in
friendship
there
was
a
dispute
about
money
matters
my
uncle
charles
was
in
the
city
the
two
estates
being
left
by
my
grandfather
to
the
two
oldest
sons
charles
died
a
poor
man
having
lost
his
fortune
by
speculation
have
you
seen
your
cousin
robert
did
he
resemble
alan
and
you
we
were
all
as
like
as
peas
people
say
that
our
house
is
remarkable
for
the
unchanging
type
of
its
male
line
that
is
readily
demonstrated
by
the
family
portraits
you
have
not
been
in
the
or
at
beechcroft
or
you
must
have
noticed
this
instantly
brett
flung
himself
into
a
chair
the
argentine
he
muttered
a
nice
school
for
a
he
had
calmed
sufficiently
to
reach
for
his
when
smith
entered
with
a
note
delivered
by
a
boy
messenger
it
was
from
winter
have
found
okasaki
his
name
is
now
numagawa
jiro
so
you
were
right
as
usual
he
and
jiro
live
at
john
mansions
kensington
chapter
xi
okasaki
in
fifteen
minutes
brett
was
bowling
along
knightsbridge
in
a
hansom
having
left
hume
with
a
strict
injunction
to
rack
his
brains
for
any
further
undiscovered
facts
bearing
upon
the
inquiry
and
turn
up
promptly
at
ten
next
morning
although
the
hour
was
late
for
calling
upon
a
complete
stranger
the
barrister
could
not
rest
until
he
had
inspected
the
jiro
m√©nage
no
was
a
long
way
from
the
ground
level
indeed
the
cats
of
kensington
if
sufficiently
enterprising
inhabitated
the
floor
above
he
rang
and
was
surveyed
with
astonishment
by
a
very
small
is
numagawa
jiro
at
home
he
inquired
no
sir
but
jiro
is
an
infantine
wail
from
one
of
the
apartments
showed
that
there
was
also
a
young
jiro
the
maid
neither
advanced
nor
retreated
she
simply
stood
stock
still
petrified
by
the
sight
of
a
visitor
brett
suggested
that
she
should
inform
her
mistress
of
his
presence
please
sir
whispered
the
girl
are
you
from
ipswich
no
from
victoria
street
i
only
asked
sir
because
master
is
particular
about
people
from
ipswich
they
upset
missus
so
she
vanished
into
the
interior
and
came
back
to
usher
him
into
the
the
flat
was
expensively
furnished
but
very
untidy
he
at
once
perceived
however
that
the
former
okasaki
was
not
romancing
when
he
boasted
of
his
artistic
tastes
the
japanese
articles
in
the
room
were
gems
of
faience
and
lacquer
work
the
entrance
of
jiro
drew
the
barrister
eyes
from
surrounding
objects
he
was
momentarily
stunned
the
woman
was
almost
a
giantess
and
amazingly
stout
in
a
tiny
flat
waited
on
by
a
diminutive
servant
and
married
to
a
japanese
she
was
grotesque
originally
a
very
tall
and
fairly
girl
she
had
evidently
blossomed
out
like
one
of
the
gorgeous
chrysanthemums
of
her
favoured
land
assuredly
she
had
acquired
no
japanese
traits
either
in
manner
or
appearance
at
first
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
genuinely
british
bad
temper
but
brett
excelled
in
the
art
of
smoothing
the
ruffled
plumes
of
femininity
what
is
it
she
demanded
surveying
him
suspiciously
i
wish
to
see
jiro
he
said
but
permit
me
to
apologise
for
making
such
an
untimely
call
as
he
is
not
at
home
i
must
not
trouble
you
beyond
inquiring
a
likely
hour
to
see
him
he
smiled
so
pleasantly
that
the
lady
became
more
complaisant
he
may
not
be
very
long
she
commenced
but
the
youthful
jiro
voice
was
again
heard
in
fretful
complaint
my
baby
is
not
well
she
explained
poor
little
darling
said
brett
he
was
tempted
to
add
what
is
its
name
but
refrained
wo
you
sit
down
said
jiro
as
i
was
saying
my
husband
may
not
be
very
long
she
was
fated
not
to
complete
that
doubly
accurate
sentence
for
at
that
moment
a
key
rattled
in
the
outer
door
here
he
is
she
announced
and
jiro
entered
it
was
fortunate
that
the
gravity
of
his
errand
no
less
than
his
power
of
kept
brett
from
laughing
as
it
was
he
smiled
very
broadly
when
he
greeted
the
master
of
the
flat
for
the
little
man
was
small
even
for
a
japanese
the
contrast
between
him
and
his
helpmate
was
ludicrous
he
could
not
possibly
kiss
her
unless
she
stooped
nor
would
his
arms
encircle
her
shoulders
and
how
is
my
pretty
he
asked
regarding
his
wife
fondly
do
call
me
that
nummie
she
cried
turning
to
brett
she
explained
he
calls
me
a
crow
and
says
it
is
a
compliment
but
i
do
like
it
in
japan
the
clow
speaks
with
the
voice
of
love
grinned
jiro
well
it
sounds
funny
in
london
so
just
attend
to
this
gentleman
he
has
come
to
see
you
on
business
jiro
forthwith
seated
herself
to
listen
to
the
conclave
brett
though
warned
by
the
maid
remark
could
not
help
himself
so
he
went
straight
to
the
point
over
a
year
ago
he
said
you
were
in
ipswich
instantly
a
severe
chill
fell
upon
his
hearers
the
man
shrank
the
woman
expanded
but
before
either
could
utter
a
word
the
barrister
continued
personally
i
know
no
one
in
ipswich
i
have
only
visited
the
town
twice
during
an
assize
week
it
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
you
gave
the
police
some
information
with
reference
to
a
japanese
weapon
which
figured
in
a
noted
crime
and
i
have
ventured
to
come
here
to
ask
you
for
additional
details
jiro
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
relief
my
gracious
she
cried
you
did
startle
me
i
ca
bear
to
hear
the
name
of
ipswich
nowadays
i
was
married
from
there
indeed
said
brett
with
polite
interest
yes
and
my
people
are
always
hunting
me
up
and
making
a
row
because
i
married
jiro
sometimes
they
make
me
that
ill
that
i
feel
half
inclined
to
go
with
him
to
japan
he
is
always
worrying
me
to
leave
london
but
the
more
i
hear
about
japan
the
less
i
fancy
it
ah
my
own
little
broke
in
her
husband
there
you
go
again
she
snapped
calling
me
a
a
goose
indeed
now
brett
how
would
you
like
to
be
called
a
wild
goose
i
have
often
deserved
it
he
said
you
do
not
understand
chirped
jiro
in
japan
the
goose
is
beautiful
elegant
it
flies
fast
like
a
white
spilit
his
english
was
almost
perfect
but
in
words
containing
a
rolled
r
he
often
substituted
an
i
understand
enough
to
keep
away
from
japan
a
place
where
they
have
an
earthquake
every
five
minutes
and
people
live
in
paper
houses
besides
look
at
the
size
of
your
just
imagine
me
brett
walking
about
among
those
little
dolls
like
a
turkey
among
we
give
fat
people
much
admilation
said
jiro
nummie
i
do
hate
that
word
fat
i
ca
help
being
tall
and
well
developed
but
it
is
only
short
women
who
become
she
hissed
the
word
venomously
as
if
she
possessed
the
scorpion
fabled
power
to
sting
herself
evidently
jiro
dreaded
corpulence
more
than
earthquakes
brett
had
never
previously
met
such
a
strangely
assorted
couple
he
would
willingly
have
prolonged
his
visit
for
mere
amusement
but
he
was
compelled
to
return
to
the
cause
of
his
presence
unless
he
asked
direct
questions
he
would
make
no
progress
he
took
from
his
the
drawing
made
in
the
black
museum
and
handed
it
to
the
japanese
saying
would
you
mind
telling
me
the
meaning
of
that
jiro
screwed
his
queer
little
eyes
upon
the
scrawling
characters
the
methods
of
writing
in
the
far
east
being
pictorial
and
inexact
require
scrutiny
of
the
context
before
a
given
sentence
can
be
correctly
interpreted
the
little
man
made
no
trouble
about
it
however
they
are
old
chalacters
he
said
in
japan
we
joke
a
lot
evely
sign
has
sevelal
meanings
this
can
be
lead
two
ways
it
is
a
plovelb
and
says
new
field
gives
a
small
clop
or
life
is
but
fifty
years
where
did
you
see
it
on
the
blade
of
the
that
killed
sir
alan
answered
brett
and
now
he
experienced
a
fresh
difficulty
the
japanese
face
is
exceedingly
expressive
when
a
native
of
the
island
empire
smiles
or
scowls
exhibits
surprise
or
fear
he
apparently
does
these
things
with
his
whole
soul
such
facial
plasticity
provides
far
more
effective
concealment
of
real
emotions
than
the
phlegmatic
indifference
of
the
briton
who
in
the
words
of
emerson
requires
pitchforks
or
the
cry
of
to
arouse
him
it
is
possible
to
throw
an
englishman
off
his
guard
by
a
shrewd
thrust
but
numagawa
jiro
was
one
of
those
persons
whose
lineaments
would
reveal
the
same
amount
of
pain
over
a
cut
finger
as
a
broken
leg
nevertheless
brett
reply
did
unquestionably
make
him
jump
and
even
jiro
bulging
features
became
anxious
is
that
possible
said
the
japanese
it
is
velly
stlange
the
police
gentleman
did
not
tell
me
about
it
he
did
not
know
of
it
until
explained
brett
and
that
is
why
i
am
here
now
it
is
the
motto
of
some
important
japanese
family
is
it
not
it
is
a
plovelb
repeated
jiro
who
evidently
intended
to
take
thought
so
i
understand
but
used
in
this
way
it
represents
a
family
a
clan
i
do
not
know
what
a
man
so
interested
in
his
country
art
as
to
go
to
an
english
provincial
town
merely
to
see
a
small
knife
must
surely
be
able
to
decide
such
a
trivial
matter
as
the
use
of
mottoes
on
sword
blades
jiro
excellent
knowledge
of
english
seemed
to
fail
him
but
his
wife
took
up
the
defence
my
husband
had
more
to
think
about
in
ipswich
than
a
small
knife
mr
brett
very
much
more
but
it
was
the
knife
which
brought
him
to
the
place
he
carried
the
major
attraction
away
with
him
jiro
thought
this
sounded
nice
she
turned
to
her
husband
why
do
you
tell
the
gentleman
all
you
know
about
it
nummie
the
little
man
looked
at
her
curiously
before
he
spoke
to
the
barrister
i
have
nothing
to
tell
he
said
i
told
the
police
all
that
they
asked
me
that
was
a
velly
old
a
hundred
yeals
old
it
was
made
by
a
famous
altist
i
have
told
you
the
meaning
of
the
liting
that
is
all
i
know
why
did
you
give
your
name
at
ipswich
as
okasaki
demanded
brett
oh
that
is
vely
easy
okosaki
is
my
family
name
you
english
people
say
it
quicker
than
numaguwa
jiro
so
i
give
it
but
when
i
got
mallied
i
used
my
light
name
japanese
law
does
not
pelmit
the
change
of
names
now
my
ploper
name
is
numagawa
jiro
which
he
pronounced
jilo
you
told
the
detective
at
ipswich
that
the
device
on
the
handle
represented
the
setting
sun
how
did
you
know
the
sun
was
setting
and
not
rising
it
was
a
haphazard
shot
the
description
was
hume
not
winter
again
the
japanese
paused
before
answering
it
was
shown
by
the
way
in
which
the
gold
was
used
japanese
altists
have
symbols
for
ideas
that
is
one
thank
you
i
imagined
you
recognised
the
device
and
could
speak
in
the
matter
by
the
way
do
you
use
a
yes
said
jiro
my
husband
is
clever
at
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
when
he
found
the
people
could
not
read
his
writing
he
bought
a
machine
i
have
sold
it
again
interfered
jiro
after
a
hasty
glance
round
the
room
and
i
am
going
to
buy
another
jiro
rose
to
stir
the
fire
unnecessarily
they
are
most
useful
said
brett
which
make
do
you
prefer
they
are
all
vely
much
alike
answered
the
japanese
but
i
am
going
to
buy
a
yost
or
a
hammond
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
receiving
me
at
this
late
hour
said
the
barrister
rising
but
before
i
go
allow
me
to
compliment
you
on
your
remarkable
knowledge
of
english
i
am
sure
you
are
indebted
to
your
good
lady
for
your
idiomatic
command
of
the
language
i
studied
it
for
yeals
in
japan
began
jiro
but
in
vain
for
his
very
much
better
half
resented
the
word
idiomatic
i
do
know
about
that
she
snorted
he
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
when
we
were
married
but
i
made
him
drop
it
and
he
is
teaching
me
japanese
his
task
is
a
pleasant
one
it
is
the
tongue
of
poetry
and
love
again
there
was
a
pause
a
minute
later
brett
was
standing
in
the
street
trying
to
determine
how
best
to
act
he
was
fully
persuaded
that
jiro
had
in
the
first
place
identified
the
crest
as
belonging
to
one
of
the
many
samurai
clans
but
the
motto
was
new
to
him
and
its
discovery
had
revealed
the
particular
family
which
claimed
its
use
why
did
he
refuse
to
impart
his
knowledge
there
must
be
plenty
of
japanese
in
london
who
would
give
this
information
readily
again
why
did
he
lie
about
the
and
endeavour
to
mislead
him
as
to
the
make
of
the
machine
he
used
for
a
certainty
jiro
would
dispose
of
the
remington
which
he
now
possessed
well
he
should
meet
with
a
ready
purchaser
if
a
letter
from
brett
to
every
agency
in
london
would
expedite
matters
he
did
not
credit
jiro
with
the
death
of
sir
alan
nor
even
with
complicity
in
the
crime
the
japanese
had
acted
as
the
unwitting
tool
of
a
stronger
personality
and
the
little
man
brain
was
even
at
this
moment
considering
fresh
aspects
of
the
affair
not
previously
within
his
ken
moreover
how
maddening
the
whole
thing
was
beginning
with
fantastic
dream
he
reviewed
the
hitherto
unknown
elements
in
the
case
capella
fierce
passion
and
queer
behaviour
culminating
in
a
sudden
journey
to
italy
margaret
silent
agony
the
existence
of
an
argentine
cousin
the
evidence
of
rabbit
jack
the
punning
motto
on
the
jiro
perturbation
and
desire
to
prevent
his
unconscious
disclosures
with
the
final
item
came
the
ludicrous
remembrance
of
that
couple
laughing
brett
hailed
a
hansom
chapter
xii
what
the
stationmaster
saw
the
number
of
exchanges
in
london
is
not
large
impressing
the
services
of
smith
and
his
wife
as
amanuenses
brett
despatched
the
requisite
letters
before
he
retired
for
the
night
he
was
up
betimes
and
out
before
breakfast
surprising
the
domestics
of
his
club
by
an
early
visit
to
the
library
the
etona
contained
a
great
many
service
members
and
made
a
feature
of
its
complete
editions
of
army
and
navy
lists
in
one
of
the
latter
eight
years
old
brett
found
among
the
officers
of
the
at
that
time
in
commission
robert
a
later
volume
recorded
his
retirement
from
the
service
hume
and
winter
reached
brett
flat
together
any
luck
with
the
jap
sir
asked
the
detective
cheerily
brett
told
them
what
had
happened
and
winter
sighed
here
indeed
was
a
promising
subject
for
an
arrest
why
not
lock
him
up
and
seize
the
but
he
knew
the
barrister
by
this
time
and
uttered
no
word
and
now
said
brett
after
a
malicious
pause
to
enable
winter
to
declare
himself
i
am
going
back
to
stowmarket
no
hume
you
are
not
coming
with
me
when
does
fergusson
arrive
here
the
question
drove
from
david
face
the
disappointed
look
with
which
he
received
his
friend
announcement
evening
he
replied
my
father
thinks
the
old
man
should
not
risk
an
journey
he
has
also
sent
me
every
detail
he
can
get
together
either
from
documents
or
recollection
bearing
upon
our
family
history
he
produced
a
formidable
roll
of
manuscript
the
old
gentleman
had
evidently
devoted
many
hours
and
some
literary
skill
to
the
compilation
i
will
read
that
in
the
train
said
brett
you
must
start
at
once
for
portsmouth
i
have
here
a
list
of
all
the
officers
serving
with
your
cousin
robert
on
the
immediately
prior
to
his
quitting
the
navy
portsmouth
devonport
southsea
and
the
neighbourhood
will
almost
certainly
contain
some
of
them
if
not
people
there
will
know
where
they
are
to
be
found
you
must
make
yourself
known
to
them
and
endeavour
to
gain
any
sort
of
news
concerning
the
naval
men
roam
all
over
the
world
some
of
them
may
have
met
him
in
the
argentine
or
in
any
of
the
south
american
ports
where
british
warships
are
constantly
calling
he
was
a
sailor
he
left
the
navy
under
no
cloud
hence
the
presence
of
a
british
would
draw
him
like
a
magnet
do
not
come
back
here
until
you
bring
news
of
him
why
is
it
so
important
you
can
not
imagine
no
i
endeavour
to
restrain
my
imagination
i
want
facts
you
are
the
best
person
to
obtain
them
one
relative
inquiring
for
another
is
a
natural
proceeding
it
will
not
arouse
suspicions
that
you
are
a
suppose
i
obtain
news
of
his
whereabouts
telegraph
to
me
and
i
will
give
you
fresh
instructions
hume
walked
to
the
door
give
my
kind
regards
to
miss
layton
he
said
grimly
i
will
be
delighted
work
hard
you
will
see
her
all
the
sooner
there
goes
a
man
in
love
continued
brett
addressing
the
back
of
winter
skull
though
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
his
career
his
reputation
everything
he
values
most
in
this
world
is
at
stake
he
is
a
sensible
fellow
who
has
become
embittered
by
unjust
suspicion
yet
he
would
unwillingly
let
a
material
item
like
his
proceedings
sink
into
oblivion
just
for
the
sake
of
telling
a
girl
that
she
looks
more
charming
than
she
did
yesterday
or
some
equally
original
remark
peculiar
to
how
do
you
account
for
it
winter
i
give
it
up
sighed
the
detective
we
are
all
fools
where
women
are
concerned
you
surprise
me
said
the
barrister
sternly
such
a
personal
confession
of
weakness
is
unexpected
i
may
say
distressing
winter
shook
his
head
you
not
married
brett
or
you
would
talk
like
that
well
let
it
pass
i
want
you
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
that
loving
couple
and
numagawa
jiro
you
must
disguise
yourself
jiro
is
to
be
shadowed
constantly
get
any
help
you
require
but
do
it
be
off
winter
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
fasten
on
to
jiro
batten
on
him
become
his
invisible
vampire
above
all
else
discover
his
associates
run
now
to
the
bank
and
cash
this
cheque
it
repays
the
sum
you
advanced
last
night
and
provides
money
for
expenses
i
must
first
see
capella
off
gasped
the
detective
all
the
more
reason
that
you
should
fly
left
to
himself
the
barrister
compiled
memoranda
for
an
hour
or
more
he
read
through
what
he
had
written
the
web
is
spreading
quickly
he
murmured
i
wonder
what
sort
of
fly
we
shall
catch
is
he
buzzing
about
under
our
very
noses
or
will
he
be
an
unknown
variety
as
they
say
in
the
argentine
sabe
during
the
journey
to
stowmarket
he
mastered
the
contents
of
the
bulky
document
sent
from
glen
tochan
it
contained
a
great
many
irrelevant
details
but
he
made
the
following
notes
after
the
duel
in
david
hume
the
man
who
avenged
with
his
sword
the
supposed
injury
inflicted
upon
his
father
by
the
first
sir
alan
escaped
to
the
netherlands
and
was
never
heard
of
again
there
was
a
local
tradition
on
the
scotch
estate
that
five
would
meet
with
violent
deaths
in
england
the
reason
for
this
singular
belief
was
found
in
the
recorded
utterances
of
an
old
nurse
popularly
credited
with
the
gift
of
second
sight
who
prophesied
after
the
outlawry
of
the
humes
in
that
there
would
be
five
generations
of
both
families
and
that
five
frazers
would
die
in
their
boots
curiously
enough
commented
the
old
gentleman
who
supplied
this
information
aunt
elspeth
prediction
is
capable
of
two
interpretations
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
first
sir
alan
frazer
assumed
the
additional
surname
of
hume
i
have
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
any
distinct
branch
of
the
hume
family
david
sister
was
married
to
my
ancestor
at
the
time
of
the
duel
admiral
cunningham
the
hardy
old
salt
who
brought
from
japan
the
sword
used
by
a
samurai
to
commit
or
suicide
by
disembowelling
commanded
the
british
vessels
of
the
combined
squadron
which
sailed
up
the
bay
of
yedo
on
july
to
intimidate
the
mikado
he
narrowly
escaped
assassination
at
the
hands
of
a
man
who
was
knocked
down
by
a
sailor
and
soundly
kicked
after
being
disarmed
the
admiral
brought
home
the
two
weapons
taken
from
his
assailant
and
the
larger
sword
was
still
to
be
seen
in
the
armoury
at
glen
tochan
the
three
brothers
of
whom
the
writer
alone
survived
quarrelled
over
money
matters
about
eight
years
before
the
murder
of
the
fifth
baronet
the
youngest
charles
had
entangled
himself
in
a
disastrous
speculation
in
the
city
and
bitterly
reproached
alan
and
david
the
narrator
because
they
would
not
come
to
his
assistance
the
old
gentleman
laboured
through
many
pages
to
explain
the
reasons
which
actuated
this
decision
but
brett
skipped
all
of
them
finally
he
suspected
no
one
of
committing
the
crime
itself
which
was
utterly
inexplicable
at
stowmarket
the
barrister
sought
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
the
stationmaster
have
you
been
long
in
charge
of
this
station
he
asked
when
the
official
ushered
him
into
a
private
office
nearly
five
years
sir
was
the
surprised
answer
ah
then
you
know
nearly
all
the
members
of
the
family
yes
sir
i
think
so
do
you
remember
the
new
year
eve
when
the
young
baronet
was
killed
yes
generally
speaking
i
do
remember
it
the
stationmaster
was
evidently
doubtful
of
the
motives
which
actuated
this
and
resolved
not
to
commit
himself
to
positive
statements
you
recollect
of
course
that
david
was
arrested
and
tried
for
the
murder
of
his
cousin
yes
very
well
now
i
want
you
to
search
your
memory
well
and
tell
me
if
you
saw
anyone
belonging
to
the
family
in
the
station
on
that
new
year
eve
the
terrible
occurrence
at
beechcroft
the
same
night
must
have
fixed
the
facts
in
your
mind
the
stationmaster
a
cautious
man
of
kindly
disposition
seemed
to
be
troubled
by
the
interrogatory
do
you
mind
if
i
ask
you
sir
why
you
are
seeking
this
information
he
inquired
after
a
thoughtful
pause
a
very
proper
question
david
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
he
has
sought
my
help
to
clear
away
the
mystery
attached
to
his
death
but
why
do
you
come
to
me
because
you
are
a
very
likely
person
to
have
some
knowledge
on
the
point
i
raised
you
see
every
person
who
enters
or
leaves
stowmarket
by
train
that
is
true
we
railway
men
see
far
more
than
people
think
said
the
official
with
a
smile
but
it
is
very
odd
that
you
should
be
the
first
gentleman
to
think
of
talking
to
me
in
connection
with
the
affair
though
i
can
assure
you
certain
things
puzzled
me
a
good
deal
at
the
time
and
what
were
they
you
are
the
gentleman
who
came
here
three
days
ago
with
david
whom
by
the
way
i
hardly
recognised
at
first
exactly
well
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
i
did
not
interfere
because
i
could
not
see
my
way
clear
to
voluntarily
give
evidence
of
course
were
i
summoned
by
the
police
it
would
be
a
different
matter
the
incidents
of
that
new
year
eve
fairly
bewildered
me
indeed
it
was
stated
at
the
trial
sir
that
david
came
from
scotland
that
morning
left
liverpool
street
at
and
reached
stowmarket
at
yes
further
he
was
admittedly
the
second
person
to
see
his
cousin
dead
body
and
remained
at
the
hall
until
arrested
by
the
police
on
a
warrant
brett
nodded
the
stationmaster
statement
promised
to
be
intensely
interesting
well
sir
continued
the
man
excitedly
i
was
mystified
enough
on
new
year
eve
but
after
the
murder
came
out
i
thought
i
was
fairly
bewitched
that
season
is
always
a
busy
one
for
us
what
between
parcels
passengers
and
bad
weather
on
the
morning
of
december
i
fancied
i
saw
david
leave
the
london
train
due
here
at
midday
i
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
because
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
and
he
was
all
muffled
up
i
did
give
the
matter
a
second
thought
until
i
saw
him
again
step
out
of
a
carriage
at
i
looked
at
him
rather
sharp
that
time
he
was
differently
dressed
and
hurried
off
without
any
luggage
he
left
the
station
quickly
so
i
imagined
i
had
been
mistaken
a
couple
of
hours
earlier
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
when
he
appeared
by
the
this
time
he
had
several
leather
trunks
and
a
footman
from
the
hall
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
platform
excuse
me
sir
but
it
was
a
fair
licker
it
must
have
been
i
wonder
you
did
not
speak
to
him
i
wish
i
had
done
so
david
is
usually
a
very
affable
young
gentleman
but
what
between
my
surprise
and
the
bustle
of
getting
the
train
away
i
lost
the
opportunity
however
the
queerest
part
of
my
story
is
coming
i
blest
if
he
did
leave
here
again
by
the
last
train
at
i
missed
his
entrance
to
the
station
but
had
a
good
look
at
him
as
the
train
went
out
he
showed
the
at
ipswich
a
return
half
to
london
because
i
asked
by
wire
now
what
did
it
all
mean
if
i
could
tell
you
it
would
save
me
much
trouble
said
brett
gravely
but
why
did
you
not
mention
these
incidents
subsequently
perhaps
i
was
wrong
sir
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
the
best
every
one
at
the
hall
including
david
himself
would
have
proved
that
i
was
a
liar
with
respect
to
his
two
earlier
arrivals
and
his
departure
by
the
i
did
not
see
what
i
would
accomplish
except
to
arouse
a
strong
suspicion
that
i
had
been
drinking
which
would
be
unjustifiable
the
stationmaster
regained
his
dignity
i
have
been
a
teetotaler
sir
for
more
than
twenty
years
you
are
sure
you
are
making
no
mistake
nothing
of
the
kind
sir
i
must
have
been
very
much
mistaken
but
i
did
not
think
so
at
the
time
and
it
bothered
me
more
than
enough
if
my
evidence
promised
to
be
of
any
service
to
david
no
consideration
would
have
kept
me
back
as
it
was
you
thought
it
would
damage
him
i
afraid
that
was
my
idea
i
agree
with
you
it
is
far
better
that
it
never
came
to
the
knowledge
of
the
police
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
may
i
ask
sir
if
what
i
have
told
you
will
be
useful
in
your
inquiry
most
decidedly
some
day
soon
david
will
thank
you
in
person
i
suppose
you
have
no
objection
to
placing
your
observations
in
written
form
for
my
private
use
and
sending
the
statement
to
me
at
the
county
hotel
not
the
least
sir
the
barrister
walked
to
the
hotel
having
despatched
his
bag
by
a
porter
i
suppose
he
said
to
himself
that
when
winter
came
here
he
rushed
straight
to
the
how
his
round
eyes
will
bulge
out
of
their
sockets
when
i
tell
him
what
i
have
just
learnt
chapter
xiii
two
women
the
surprising
information
given
by
the
stationmaster
impressed
the
barrister
as
so
much
unexpected
trover
which
would
assert
its
value
in
the
progress
of
events
he
certainly
did
not
anticipate
the
discovery
of
three
david
humes
though
he
had
hoped
to
find
traces
of
two
before
he
reached
his
hotel
he
experienced
a
spasm
of
doubt
was
his
client
telling
the
truth
about
his
movements
on
that
memorable
christmas
eve
david
story
was
fully
corroborated
by
the
railway
official
and
the
servants
at
the
hall
whose
sworn
evidence
was
in
brett
possession
but
how
about
hume
counterfeit
presentments
arriving
by
the
earlier
trains
coming
from
where
and
bound
on
what
errands
he
resolutely
closed
down
the
opened
by
his
imagination
the
pit
does
not
yawn
for
me
he
communed
but
for
the
man
who
killed
sir
alan
assuredly
he
will
fall
into
it
before
many
days
nothing
on
earth
can
stop
the
meeting
of
two
or
more
of
the
hidden
channels
now
being
opened
up
and
when
they
do
meet
there
must
be
a
dramatic
outcome
his
chief
purpose
in
revisiting
stowmarket
was
to
seek
further
confidences
from
capella
he
argued
that
the
sudden
journey
of
her
husband
to
naples
would
cause
her
much
uneasiness
and
she
might
now
be
inclined
to
reveal
circumstances
yet
hidden
he
refused
to
take
her
at
a
disadvantage
from
the
hotel
he
sent
a
cyclist
messenger
with
a
note
asking
for
an
interview
and
within
an
hour
he
received
a
cordial
request
to
come
at
once
nevertheless
he
was
not
a
little
astonished
to
find
helen
layton
awaiting
him
in
margaret
boudoir
the
girl
showed
signs
of
recent
agitation
but
she
explained
her
presence
quietly
enough
capella
sent
for
me
when
your
note
reached
her
brett
she
is
greatly
upset
by
recent
events
and
was
actually
on
the
point
of
telegraphing
to
davie
to
ask
him
to
bring
you
here
at
once
when
your
message
was
handed
to
her
she
will
be
here
presently
please
do
not
press
her
too
closely
to
reveal
anything
she
wishes
to
withhold
she
is
so
emotional
and
excited
poor
thing
that
i
fear
her
health
may
be
endangered
miss
layton
words
were
not
well
chosen
she
was
conscious
of
the
fact
and
blushed
furiously
when
brett
received
her
request
with
a
friendly
nod
of
comprehension
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
for
the
best
she
went
on
desperately
i
am
so
sorry
for
margaret
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
terrible
thing
that
my
proposed
marriage
with
her
cousin
should
be
the
innocent
cause
of
all
this
trouble
is
it
the
cause
he
asked
what
else
can
it
be
certainly
not
capella
foolish
actions
if
davie
and
i
were
married
and
far
away
from
this
neighbourhood
we
would
probably
never
see
him
again
i
assure
you
i
attach
no
serious
significance
to
his
mad
fancy
for
me
the
real
reason
for
the
present
bother
is
davie
desire
to
reopen
the
story
of
the
murder
of
that
i
am
convinced
then
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
helen
eyes
became
suspiciously
moist
how
am
i
to
decide
she
said
tremulously
naturally
i
want
the
name
of
my
future
husband
to
be
cleared
of
the
odium
attached
to
it
but
it
is
hard
that
this
can
not
be
done
without
driving
a
dear
woman
like
margaret
to
despair
perhaps
to
the
grave
i
do
not
see
why
the
one
course
should
involve
the
other
nor
do
i
but
the
fact
remains
capella
decision
to
go
to
naples
is
somehow
bound
up
with
it
oh
dear
during
the
last
two
years
a
dozen
or
more
girls
have
been
happily
married
in
this
village
without
any
one
being
killed
or
running
away
or
dying
of
grief
why
should
those
things
descend
upon
my
poor
little
head
perhaps
you
are
mistaken
events
have
conspired
to
point
to
you
as
the
unconscious
source
of
a
good
deal
that
has
happened
personally
miss
layton
i
incline
to
the
belief
that
you
are
no
more
responsible
than
david
if
the
mystery
of
sir
alan
death
is
ever
solved
i
feel
assured
that
its
genesis
will
be
found
in
circumstances
not
only
beyond
your
control
but
wholly
independent
and
likely
to
operate
in
the
same
way
if
both
you
and
your
had
never
either
seen
or
heard
of
beechcroft
hall
oh
brett
she
cried
impulsively
i
wish
i
could
be
certain
of
that
try
and
adopt
my
opinion
he
answered
with
a
smile
for
the
dubiety
was
not
very
flattering
i
know
i
am
saying
the
wrong
thing
i
can
not
help
it
margaret
distress
tried
me
sorely
be
gentle
with
her
that
is
all
i
ask
the
door
opened
and
capella
entered
helen
observations
had
prepared
brett
to
some
extent
yet
he
was
shocked
to
see
the
havoc
wrought
in
margaret
appearance
by
days
of
suffering
and
nights
of
sleepless
agony
her
face
was
drawn
and
her
eyes
unnaturally
brilliant
her
lips
bloodless
and
pinched
she
was
again
garbed
in
black
and
the
sombre
effect
of
her
dress
supplied
a
startling
contrast
to
the
deathly
pallor
of
her
features
she
recognised
brett
presence
by
a
silent
bow
and
sank
on
to
a
couch
she
was
not
acting
but
really
ill
overwrought
inert
physically
weak
from
want
of
food
and
sleep
helen
ran
to
her
side
and
took
her
in
a
loving
clasp
you
poor
darling
she
cried
why
are
you
suffering
so
now
there
was
nothing
on
earth
brett
detested
so
thoroughly
as
a
display
of
feminine
sentiment
no
matter
how
spontaneous
or
at
heart
he
was
conscious
of
kindred
emotions
a
child
cry
a
woman
sob
the
groan
of
a
despairing
man
had
power
to
move
him
so
strangely
that
he
had
more
than
once
allowed
a
opportunity
to
slip
from
his
grasp
rather
than
sear
his
own
soul
by
displaying
callous
indifference
to
the
sufferings
of
others
the
tears
of
these
two
however
set
his
teeth
on
edge
what
were
they
whining
about
the
affections
of
a
doll
of
a
man
whose
antics
had
been
rightly
treated
by
david
when
he
proved
to
capella
that
there
is
nothing
like
leather
for
the
barrister
laboured
under
no
delusions
respecting
either
woman
margaret
who
secretly
feared
her
husband
was
only
pining
for
his
rekindled
admiration
whilst
helen
though
true
as
steel
to
david
hume
could
not
be
expected
to
regard
the
italian
misplaced
passion
as
utterly
outrageous
no
woman
can
absolutely
hate
and
despise
a
man
for
loving
her
no
matter
how
absurd
or
impossible
his
passion
may
be
she
may
proclaim
even
feel
a
vast
amount
of
indignation
but
in
the
secret
recesses
of
her
soul
hidden
perhaps
from
her
own
scrutiny
she
can
find
excuses
for
him
brett
regarded
capella
as
an
impressionable
scamp
endowed
with
a
too
vivid
imagination
and
he
determined
forthwith
to
stir
his
hearers
into
revolt
defiance
anything
but
languishing
regret
and
condolence
margaret
soon
gave
him
an
opportunity
recovering
her
with
an
effort
she
said
i
am
glad
you
are
here
brett
helen
has
probably
told
you
that
we
need
your
presence
not
that
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
but
i
must
have
the
advice
of
a
wiser
and
clearer
head
than
my
own
in
the
present
position
of
affairs
exactly
so
replied
the
barrister
cheerily
as
a
preliminary
to
a
pleasant
chat
may
i
suggest
a
cup
of
tea
for
each
of
us
the
ladies
were
manifestly
astonished
tea
when
broken
hearts
were
scattered
around
the
suggestion
was
pure
bathos
margaret
with
a
touch
of
severity
permitted
brett
to
ring
and
coldly
agreed
with
helen
declaration
that
she
could
not
think
of
touching
any
species
of
refreshment
at
such
a
moment
then
said
brett
advancing
and
holding
out
his
hand
i
will
save
your
servants
from
needless
trouble
capella
i
am
equally
emphatic
in
my
insistence
on
food
and
drink
as
primary
necessities
for
instance
a
cup
of
good
tea
just
now
is
much
more
important
in
my
eyes
than
your
vagaries
surely
you
will
not
desert
me
appealed

brett
how
can
you
be
so
heartless
cried
helen
your
words
cut
me
to
the
bone
he
answered
with
an
easy
smile
but
in
this
matter
i
must
be
adamant
my
dear
ladies
pray
consider
what
a
world
we
should
live
in
if
people
went
without
their
meals
because
they
were
worried
three
days
of
such
treatment
would
end
the
south
african
war
give
ireland
home
rule
bring
even
the
american
senate
to
reason
a
week
of
it
would
extinguish
the
human
race
if
the
system
has
such
potentialities
is
it
unreasonable
to
ask
whether
or
not
any
single
individual
even
capella
is
worth
the
loss
of
a
cup
of
tea
because
he
chooses
to
go
to
naples
a
servant
entered
is
it
to
be
for
three
or
none
inquired
brett
compelling
margaret
to
meet
his
gaze
james
bring
tea
at
once
said
capella
the
barrister
accepted
this
partial
surrender
he
looked
out
over
the
park
what
lovely
weather
brett
exclaimed
how
delightful
it
must
be
at
the
just
now
really
i
am
greatly
tempted
to
run
up
to
whitby
for
a
few
days
have
you
ever
been
there
capella
or
you
miss
layton
no
well
let
me
recommend
the
coast
of
yorkshire
as
a
cure
for
all
ills
do
you
know
that
within
the
next
fortnight
you
can
if
energetic
enough
see
from
the
cliffs
at
whitby
the
sun
rise
and
set
in
the
sea
it
is
the
one
place
in
england
where
such
a
sight
is
possible
and
the
breeze
there
when
it
blows
from
the
north
it
comes
straight
from
the
polar
sea
there
is
no
land
intervening
naples
dirty
naples
pah
who
but
a
lunatic
would
prefer
naples
to
whitby
in
july
margaret
was
now
incensed
helen
surprised
and
even
slightly
amused
brett
rattled
on
demanding
and
receiving
occasional
curt
replies
the
tea
came
whatever
the
failings
of
beechcroft
might
be
they
had
not
reached
the
kitchen
delightful
little
rolls
of
thin
bread
and
butter
sandwiches
of
cucumber
and
de
foie
tempting
morsels
of
pastry
jam
and
crisp
biscuits
showed
that
the
housekeeper
had
unconsciously
adopted
brett
view
of
her
mistress
needs
margaret
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
toyed
at
first
with
these
delicacies
until
she
yielded
to
the
demands
of
her
stimulated
appetite
helen
and
brett
were
unfeignedly
hungry
and
when
brett
rose
to
ring
for
more
cucumber
sandwiches
they
all
laughed
the
first
time
i
met
you
said
margaret
whose
cheeks
began
to
exhibit
a
faint
trace
of
colour
i
told
you
that
you
could
read
a
woman
heart
i
did
not
know
you
were
also
qualified
to
act
as
her
physician
if
the
first
part
of
my
treatment
is
deemed
successful
then
i
hope
you
will
adopt
the
second
i
am
quite
in
earnest
concerning
whitby
or
cromer
if
you
do
not
care
to
go
far
north
but
brett
how
can
i
possibly
leave
beechcroft
now
did
capella
consult
you
when
he
went
to
naples
are
you
not
mistress
here
take
my
advice
give
the
majority
of
your
servants
a
holiday
close
your
house
or
better
still
have
every
room
dismantled
on
the
pretence
of
a
thorough
renovation
leave
it
to
paperhangers
plasterers
and
caretakers
the
rector
may
be
persuaded
to
allow
miss
layton
to
come
with
you
to
london
where
you
should
visit
your
dressmaker
for
you
can
now
dispense
with
mourning
when
your
husband
returns
from
naples
let
him
rage
to
the
top
of
his
bent
by
that
time
i
may
be
able
to
spare
hume
to
look
after
both
of
you
for
a
week
or
so
permit
your
husband
to
join
you
when
he
humbly
seeks
permission
not
before
believe
me
capella
if
you
have
strength
of
will
to
adopt
my
programme
in
its
entirety
the
trip
to
naples
may
have
results
wholly
unexpected
by
the
runaway
really
margaret
brett
advice
seems
to
me
to
be
very
sensible
it
happens
too
that
my
father
needs
a
change
of
air
and
i
think
we
could
both
persuade
him
to
come
with
us
to
the
coast
helen
like
all
well
regulated
young
englishwomen
quickly
took
a
reasonable
view
of
the
problem
already
capella
heroics
and
his
lamentations
began
to
appear
ridiculous
margaret
looked
wistfully
at
both
of
them
you
do
not
understand
why
my
husband
has
gone
to
naples
she
said
slowly
seemingly
revolving
something
in
her
mind
i
think
i
can
guess
his
motive
said
the
barrister
tell
me
your
explanation
of
the
riddle
she
answered
lightly
though
a
shadow
of
fear
crossed
her
eyes
soon
after
your
marriage
he
imagined
that
he
discovered
certain
facts
connected
with
your
family
possibly
relative
to
your
death
which
served
to
estrange
him
from
you
whatever
they
may
be
whether
existent
or
fanciful
you
are
in
no
way
responsible
he
has
gone
to
naples
to
obtain
proofs
of
his
suspicions
or
knowledge
he
will
come
back
to
terrorise
you
perhaps
to
seek
revenge
for
imaginary
wrongs
therefore
i
say
do
not
meet
him
by
sitting
here
blanched
and
fearful
until
it
pleases
him
to
return
compel
him
to
seek
you
let
him
find
you
at
least
outwardly
happy
and
contented
careless
of
his
neglect
and
more
pleased
than
otherwise
by
his
absence
tell
him
to
try
algiers
in
august
and
calcutta
in
september
margaret
eyes
were
widely
distended
her
mobile
features
expressed
both
astonishment
and
anxiety
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
in
an
attitude
of
deep
perplexity
they
knew
she
was
wrestling
with
the
impulse
to
take
them
wholly
into
confidence
at
last
she
spoke
i
can
not
tell
you
she
said
how
comforting
your
words
are
if
you
a
stranger
can
estimate
the
truth
so
nearly
why
should
i
torture
myself
because
my
husband
is
outrageously
unjust
i
will
follow
your
counsel
brett
if
possible
nellie
and
i
will
leave
here
perhaps
eastham
may
be
able
to
come
with
us
to
town
will
you
order
my
carriage
a
drive
will
do
me
good
come
with
nellie
and
me
and
stay
here
to
dinner
for
we
may
dispense
with
ceremony
she
left
the
room
walking
with
a
firm
and
confident
step
brett
turned
to
miss
layton
capella
is
in
for
trouble
he
said
with
a
laugh
he
will
be
forced
to
make
love
to
his
wife
a
second
time
chapter
xiv
margaret
speaks
out
during
the
drive
the
presence
of
servants
rendered
conversation
impossible
on
the
one
topic
that
engrossed
their
thoughts
the
barrister
therefore
had
an
opportunity
to
display
the
other
side
of
his
engaging
personality
his
singular
knowledge
of
the
world
his
acquaintance
with
the
latest
developments
in
literature
and
the
arts
and
so
much
of
london
as
was
suited
to
the
ears
of
polite
society
once
he
amused
the
ladies
greatly
by
a
trivial
instance
of
his
faculty
for
deducing
a
definite
fact
from
seemingly
inadequate
signs
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
horses
they
passed
a
field
in
which
some
people
were
working
neither
of
the
women
paid
attention
to
the
scene
brett
from
mere
force
of
habit
took
in
all
details
a
little
farther
on
he
said
are
we
approaching
a
village
yes
answered
miss
layton
a
small
place
named
needham
then
it
will
not
surprise
me
if
during
the
next
two
minutes
we
meet
a
horse
and
cart
with
a
load
of
potatoes
the
driver
is
a
young
man
in
his
shirt
sleeves
sitting
by
his
side
is
a
maid
in
a
poke
bonnet
probably
his
left
arm
follows
the
line
of
her
apron
string
his
hearers
could
not
help
being
surprised
by
this
prediction
helen
leaned
over
the
side
and
looked
ahead
you
are
wrong
this
time
brett
she
laughed
merrily
the
only
vehicle
between
us
and
a
turn
in
the
road
is
a
coming
this
way
that
merely
shows
the
necessity
of
carefully
choosing
one
words
i
should
have
said
not
the
carriage
sped
swiftly
along
helen
craned
her
head
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
yet
hidden
stretch
of
road
beyond
the
turning
good
gracious
she
cried
suddenly
even
margaret
was
stimulated
to
curiosity
she
bent
over
the
opposite
side
what
an
extraordinary
thing
she
exclaimed
brett
sat
unmoved
anything
in
front
being
of
course
quite
invisible
to
him
on
the
box
the
coachman
nudged
the
footman
as
if
to
say
did
you
ever
well
me
for
in
the
next
few
strides
the
horses
had
to
be
pulled
to
one
side
to
avoid
a
cart
laden
with
potatoes
driven
by
a
coatless
youth
who
had
one
arm
thrown
gracefully
around
the
waist
of
a
girl
in
a
huge
bonnet
nellie
turned
and
stared
at
them
in
most
unladylike
manner
much
to
their
discomfiture
i
do
declare
she
cried
the
girl
has
brown
eyes
brett
do
tell
us
how
you
did
it
i
will
he
replied
gaily
those
labourers
in
a
field
half
a
mile
away
were
digging
potatoes
among
the
women
sorters
was
a
girl
who
was
gazing
anxiously
in
this
direction
and
who
resumed
work
in
a
very
bad
temper
when
another
woman
spoke
to
her
in
a
chaffing
way
the
gate
was
left
open
and
there
were
fresh
in
this
direction
the
men
were
all
coatless
so
i
argued
a
young
man
driving
and
a
girl
by
his
side
hence
the
annoyance
of
the
watcher
in
the
field
owing
particularly
to
the
position
of
his
arm
the
presence
on
the
road
of
several
potatoes
with
the
earth
still
damp
on
them
added
certainty
to
my
convictions
it
is
very
easy
you
see
yes
but
how
about
the
colour
of
the
girl
eyes
that
was
hazardous
to
an
extent
but
five
out
of
every
six
women
in
this
county
have
brown
eyes
well
you
may
think
it
easy
to
me
it
is
marvellous
it
is
positively
startling
said
margaret
seriously
and
if
the
barrister
indulged
in
a
fresh
series
of
deductions
he
remained
silent
on
the
topic
he
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
to
naples
but
was
foiled
by
capella
positive
disinclination
to
discuss
italy
on
any
pretext
and
miss
layton
natural
desire
not
to
embarrass
her
friend
indeed
so
little
headway
did
he
make
so
fully
was
margaret
mind
taken
up
with
the
new
departure
he
had
suggested
that
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
rectory
to
drop
helen
who
wished
to
tell
her
father
about
the
dinner
and
to
change
her
costume
he
was
strongly
tempted
to
wriggle
out
of
the
engagement
inclination
pulled
him
to
his
quiet
in
the
county
hotel
impulse
bade
him
remain
and
make
the
most
of
the
meagre
opportunities
offered
by
the
drift
of
conversation
i
hope
said
helen
at
parting
that
i
may
persuade
you
to
come
here
and
dine
with
my
father
some
evening
when
capella
and
i
are
in
town
if
you
take
any
interest
in
old
coins
he
will
entertain
you
for
hours
then
i
depend
on
you
to
bring
an
invitation
to
the
hall
this
evening
i
expect
to
be
in
stowmarket
next
week
are
you
leaving
inquired
capella
i
think
so
would
you
care
to
walk
to
the
house
with
me
now
i
will
be
delighted
so
the
carriage
was
sent
off
and
the
two
followed
on
foot
brett
thought
that
impulse
had
led
him
aright
once
past
the
lodge
gates
margaret
looked
at
him
suddenly
with
a
quick
searching
glance
hume
was
not
in
error
when
he
spoke
of
her
continental
tricks
of
manner
you
wonder
she
said
why
i
do
not
trust
you
fully
you
know
that
i
am
keeping
something
back
from
you
you
imagine
that
you
can
guess
a
good
deal
of
what
i
am
endeavouring
to
hide
to
all
those
questions
i
may
generally
answer
of
course
you
observe
the
small
things
of
life
the
larger
events
are
built
from
them
well
i
can
be
candid
with
you
my
husband
believes
that
i
not
only
deceived
him
in
regard
to
my
marriage
but
he
is
or
was
very
jealous
of
me
she
paused
apparently
unable
to
frame
her
words
satisfactorily
having
said
so
much
put
in
the
barrister
gently
you
might
be
more
specific
his
cool
even
voice
reassured
her
i
hardly
know
how
best
to
express
myself
she
cried
question
me
i
will
reply
so
far
as
i
am
able
thank
you
you
have
told
me
that
you
first
met
capella
on
new
eve
two
years
ago
at
covent
garden
that
is
so
had
you
ever
heard
of
him
before
never
he
was
brought
to
my
party
by
an
italian
friend
did
the
acquaintance
ripen
rapidly
yes
we
found
that
our
tastes
were
identical
in
many
respects
i
did
not
know
of
my
brother
death
until
the
of
january
no
one
in
beechcroft
had
my
address
and
my
solicitor
office
was
closed
on
the
holiday
capella
called
on
me
by
request
the
day
after
the
ball
and
already
i
became
aware
of
his
admiration
italians
are
quick
to
fall
in
love
and
afterwards
when
poor
alan
murder
appeared
in
the
press
giovanni
was
among
the
first
to
write
me
a
sympathetic
letter
later
on
we
met
several
times
in
london
i
did
not
come
to
reside
in
the
hall
until
all
legal
formalities
were
settled
a
year
passed
i
went
to
naples
he
came
from
his
estate
in
calabria
and
we
renewed
our
friendship
you
do
not
know
perhaps
that
he
is
a
count
in
his
own
country
but
we
decided
not
to
use
the
title
here
then
capella
is
not
a
poor
man
by
no
means
he
is
far
from
rich
as
we
understand
the
word
he
is
worth
i
believe
why
do
you
ask
had
you
the
impression
that
he
married
me
for
my
money
there
might
well
be
other
reasons
thought
brett
glancing
at
the
beautiful
and
stately
woman
by
his
side
but
it
was
no
moment
for
idle
compliments
such
things
have
been
done
he
said
drily
then
disabuse
your
mind
of
the
idea
he
is
a
very
proud
man
his
estates
are
involved
and
in
our
first
few
days
of
happiness
we
did
indeed
discuss
the
means
of
freeing
them
whilst
our
marriage
contract
stipulates
that
in
the
event
of
either
of
us
predeceasing
the
other
and
there
being
no
children
the
survivor
inherits
but
all
at
once
a
cloud
came
between
us
and
giovanni
has
curtly
declined
any
assistance
by
me
in
discharging
his
family
debt
brett
could
not
help
remembering
capella
passionate
declaration
to
helen
but
margaret
words
read
a
new
meaning
into
it
possibly
the
italian
was
only
making
a
forlorn
hope
attack
on
a
country
natural
desire
to
shine
amidst
her
friends
well
time
would
tell
meanwhile
capella
outburst
of
confidence
was
valuable
a
cloud
he
said
what
sort
of
a
cloud
giovanni
suddenly
discovered
that
his
father
and
mine
were
deadly
enemies
it
was
a
cruel
whim
of
fate
that
brought
us
together
poor
fellow
he
was
very
fond
of
his
father
and
it
seems
that
a
legacy
of
revenge
was
bequeathed
to
him
against
an
englishman
named
beechcroft
i
remembered
too
late
that
he
once
asked
me
how
our
house
came
to
be
so
named
and
i
explained
its
english
meaning
to
him
i
joked
about
it
and
said
the
place
should
rightly
be
called
yewcroft
during
our
honeymoon
at
naples
he
learnt
that
my
father
for
some
reason
had
travelled
over
a
large
part
of
italy
in
an
assumed
name
how
did
he
learn
this
broke
in
brett
i
can
not
tell
you
the
affair
happened
like
a
flash
of
lightning
we
had
been
to
capri
one
afternoon
and
i
was
tired
i
went
to
my
room
to
rest
for
a
couple
of
hours
fell
asleep
and
awoke
to
find
giovanni
staring
at
me
in
the
most
terrifying
manner
there
was
a
fierce
scene
we
are
both
and
when
he
accused
me
of
a
ridiculous
endeavour
to
hoodwink
him
in
some
indefinable
way
i
became
very
indignant
we
patched
up
a
sort
of
truce
but
i
may
honestly
say
that
we
have
not
had
a
moment
happiness
since
but
you
spoke
of
jealousy
also
that
is
really
too
absurd
my
cousin
robert
what
the
gentleman
from
the
argentine
yes
i
suppose
david
told
you
about
him
he
did
said
the
barrister
grimly
robert
is
poor
you
may
know
he
is
also
very
a
family
trait
brett
could
not
avoid
saying
it
has
not
been
an
advantage
to
us
she
replied
mournfully
they
were
standing
now
opposite
the
library
almost
on
the
spot
where
her
brother
fell
they
turned
and
strolled
back
towards
the
lodge
robert
came
to
see
me
she
resumed
he
paid
a
visit
in
unconventional
manner
waylaid
me
in
fact
in
this
very
avenue
and
asked
me
to
help
him
he
declined
to
meet
my
husband
and
was
very
bitter
about
my
marriage
to
a
foreigner
however
i
forgave
him
for
my
own
heart
was
sore
in
me
and
he
also
had
been
unfortunate
in
a
different
way
we
had
a
long
talk
and
i
kissed
him
at
parting
i
afterwards
found
that
giovanni
had
seen
us
from
his
bedroom
he
thought
robert
was
david
i
do
not
think
he
believed
me
even
when
i
showed
him
the
counterfoil
of
my
and
the
amount
of
a
remittance
i
sent
to
robert
next
day
how
much
was
the
sum
five
hundred
pounds
and
where
did
you
send
it
to
the
hotel
victoria
in
his
own
name
certainly
have
you
ever
met
him
since
yes
unfortunately
i
was
in
london
driving
through
regent
street
in
a
hansom
when
i
saw
him
on
the
pavement
i
stopped
the
cab
and
asked
him
to
come
to
luncheon
we
have
no
town
house
so
i
was
staying
at
the
carlton
alone
yet
how
stupidly
compromising
circumstances
can
occasionally
become
i
returned
to
beechcroft
i
did
not
mention
my
meeting
with
robert
because
indeed
giovanni
and
i
were
hardly
on
speaking
terms
one
day
in
the
library
i
was
sorting
a
number
of
accounts
when
i
was
summoned
elsewhere
for
a
few
minutes
on
top
of
the
pile
was
my
receipted
hotel
bill
my
husband
came
in
glanced
at
the
paper
and
saw
a
charge
for
a
guest
when
i
returned
he
asked
me
whom
i
had
been
entertaining
i
told
him
and
could
not
help
blushing
the
affair
being
so
flagrantly
absurd
is
that
all
i
declare
to
you
brett
that
you
are
now
as
well
informed
as
i
am
myself
concerning
our
estrangement
there
is
i
take
it
no
objection
on
your
part
to
the
inquiry
i
have
undertaken
the
fixing
of
responsibility
for
your
brother
death
i
mean
margaret
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
before
she
said
in
a
low
and
steady
voice
we
are
a
strange
race
we
somehow
i
felt
when
i
first
saw
you
and
davie
together
that
you
would
be
bound
up
with
a
crisis
in
my
life
i
dread
crises
they
have
ever
been
unfortunate
for
me
i
can
not
explain
myself
further
i
know
i
am
approaching
an
eventful
epoch
well
i
am
prepared
go
on
with
your
work
in
god
name
i
can
not
become
more
unhappy
than
i
am
chapter
xv
an
unexpected
visitor
a
clock
in
the
church
tower
chimed
the
we
dine
at
seven
said
capella
let
us
return
to
the
house
i
told
the
housekeeper
to
prepare
a
room
for
you
would
you
care
to
remain
for
the
night
one
of
the
grooms
can
bring
from
stowmarket
any
articles
you
may
need
brett
declined
the
invitation
pleading
a
certain
amount
of
work
to
be
done
before
he
retired
to
rest
and
his
expectation
of
finding
letters
or
telegrams
at
the
hotel
they
walked
more
rapidly
up
the
avenue
and
the
barrister
noted
the
graceful
ease
of
margaret
movements
is
it
a
fact
he
asked
that
you
suffer
from
heart
disease
she
laughed
and
said
with
a
certain
charming
hesitation
you
are
both
doctor
and
lawyer
brett
my
heart
is
quite
sound
i
have
been
foolish
enough
to
seek
relief
from
my
troubles
in
morphia
do
not
be
alarmed
i
am
not
a
morphin√©e
i
promised
nellie
yesterday
to
stop
it
and
i
am
quite
certain
to
succeed
the
dinner
passed
uneventfully
as
brett
was
unable
to
change
his
clothes
neither
of
the
ladies
of
course
appeared
in
elaborate
costumes
helen
wore
a
simple
white
muslin
dress
with
pale
blue
ribbons
margaret
mindful
of
the
barrister
hint
concerning
her
attire
now
appeared
in
pale
grey
cr√™pe
de
chine
trimmed
with
cerise
panne
velvet
when
she
entered
the
she
almost
startled
the
others
so
strong
was
the
contrast
between
her
present
effective
garments
and
the
black
raiment
she
had
affected
constantly
since
her
return
to
beechcroft
after
her
marriage
the
reform
has
commenced
she
cried
gaily
seeing
how
they
looked
at
her
my
maid
is
in
ecstasies
about
the
proposed
visit
to
my
dressmaker
she
insisted
on
showing
me
a
study
for
an
ascot
frock
in
the
ah
she
is
a
frenchwoman
said
brett
yes
and
pray
what
mystery
have
you
elucidated
now
not
a
mystery
but
a
sober
fact
a
frenchwoman
must
be
in
the
mode
anybody
else
would
have
told
you
to
copy
yourself
fashions
are
a
sealed
book
to
me
but
i
do
claim
a
certain
taste
in
colour
effect
and
you
have
gratified
it
and
have
you
nothing
nice
to
say
to
me
mr
brett
pouted
helen
so
much
that
i
must
remain
dumb
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
hume
tragic
air
when
he
asked
me
to
give
you
kind
regards
the
dear
boy
you
have
not
yet
told
us
why
you
left
him
in
london
in
view
of
capella
outspokenness
concerning
her
cousin
this
was
a
poser
brett
fenced
with
the
query
and
the
announcement
of
dinner
stopped
all
personal
references
the
barrister
eyes
wandered
round
the
the
shaded
candles
on
the
table
did
not
permit
much
light
to
fall
on
the
walls
but
such
portraits
as
were
visible
showed
that
david
was
right
when
he
said
the
were
all
alike
they
were
a
handsome
race
strong
dour
inflexible
the
night
was
beautifully
fine
the
day
seemed
loth
to
die
and
the
twilight
lingering
on
the
pleasant
landscape
tempted
them
outside
after
the
butler
had
handed
brett
a
box
of
excellent
cigars
they
went
through
the
conservatory
into
the
park
and
sauntered
over
the
springy
pastureland
whilst
brett
amused
the
ladies
by
a
carefully
edited
account
of
his
visit
to
the
jiro
family
an
hour
passed
in
pleasant
chat
then
miss
layton
thought
it
was
time
she
went
home
and
brett
proposed
to
escort
her
to
the
rectory
subsequently
picking
up
his
conveyance
at
the
inn
they
walked
obliquely
across
the
park
towards
the
house
regaining
it
through
a
clump
of
laurels
and
the
conservatory
it
chanced
that
for
a
moment
they
were
silent
margaret
led
the
way
helen
followed
brett
came
close
behind
when
the
mistress
of
beechcroft
hall
stepped
on
to
the
turf
in
front
of
the
library
a
man
who
was
standing
under
the
yews
a
little
way
down
the
avenue
moved
forward
to
accost
her
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
alarm
and
retreated
quickly
why
davie
cried
helen
surely
it
can
not
be
you
the
stranger
made
no
reply
but
paused
irresolutely
even
in
the
dim
light
brett
needed
no
second
glance
to
reveal
to
him
the
astounding
coincidence
that
this
mysterious
prowler
was
robert
good
evening
he
said
politely
do
you
wish
to
see
your
cousin
and
who
the
devil
may
you
be
was
the
uncompromising
answer
a
friend
of
mrs
capella
h
i
glad
to
hear
it
i
thought
you
could
not
be
that
beastly
italian
you
are
candour
itself
but
you
have
not
answered
me
about
seeing
my
cousin
no
i
will
call
when
she
is
less
engaged
he
turned
to
go
but
brett
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
will
you
come
quietly
he
said
or
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
the
other
man
wheeled
round
again
that
he
feared
no
personal
violence
was
evident
indeed
it
was
possible
brett
had
his
own
strength
in
suggesting
the
alternative
the
argentine
cousin
laughed
boisterously
by
the
lord
harry
he
cried
i
like
your
style
i
will
come
in
if
only
to
have
a
good
look
at
you
they
approached
the
two
frightened
women
margaret
had
recognised
his
voice
and
now
advanced
with
outstretched
hand
i
am
glad
to
see
you
robert
she
said
in
tones
that
vibrated
somewhat
why
did
you
not
let
me
know
you
were
coming
because
i
did
not
know
myself
until
an
hour
before
i
left
london
moreover
you
might
have
wired
and
told
me
to
stop
away
so
i
sailed
without
orders
the
position
was
awkward
the
had
evidently
walked
from
stowmarket
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
soiled
and
a
trifle
truculent
perhaps
but
a
man
of
birth
and
good
breeding
helen
was
gazing
at
him
in
sheer
wonderment
he
was
so
extremely
like
david
that
at
a
distance
it
was
easy
to
confuse
the
one
with
the
other
brett
too
examined
him
curiously
he
recalled
rabbit
jack
pronouncement
either
the
chap
hisself
or
his
dead
spit
but
it
behoved
him
to
rescue
the
ladies
from
an
when
you
reached
stowmarket
did
the
stationmaster
exhibit
any
marked
interest
in
you
he
inquired
well
now
that
beats
the
band
cried
robert
he
looked
at
me
as
though
i
had
seven
heads
and
horns
to
match
but
how
did
you
know
that
merely
on
account
of
your
marked
resemblance
to
david
it
puzzled
the
stationmaster
some
time
ago
by
the
way
you
appear
to
like
the
shade
of
the
yew
trees
outside
do
you
always
approach
beechcroft
hall
in
the
same
way
the
bold
eyes
did
not
fall
before
the
barrister
penetrating
glance
what
the
deuce
has
it
got
to
do
with
you
he
replied
fiercely
who
has
appointed
you
grand
inquisitor
to
the
family
i
should
like
to
know
margaret
i
beg
your
pardon
but
this
chap
is
my
friend
reginald
brett
he
is
engaged
in
unravelling
the
manner
and
cause
of
poor
alan
death
he
has
my
full
sanction
robert
and
was
brought
here
in
the
first
instance
by
david
i
hope
therefore
you
will
treat
him
more
civilly
i
will
treat
him
as
he
treats
me
i
owe
him
nothing
at
any
rate
they
were
talking
in
the
library
having
entered
the
house
through
the
centre
window
the
unbidden
guest
faced
the
others
and
although
the
cloud
of
suspicion
hung
heavily
upon
him
the
barrister
was
far
too
shrewd
an
observer
of
human
nature
to
attribute
his
present
defiant
attitude
to
other
than
its
true
origin
a
feeling
of
humiliated
pride
brett
understood
that
to
question
him
further
was
to
risk
a
scene
a
thing
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs
no
doubt
he
said
you
wish
to
speak
privately
to
capella
i
was
on
the
point
of
escorting
miss
layton
to
her
house
shall
i
return
and
drive
you
back
to
stowmarket
i
will
be
here
in
fifteen
minutes
it
would
be
better
than
walking
replied
robert
wearily
settling
into
a
chair
with
the
air
of
a
man
physically
tired
and
mentally
perturbed
again
there
was
a
dramatic
pause
helen
more
alarmed
than
she
wished
to
admit
gave
margaret
a
questioning
look
and
received
a
strained
but
reassuring
smile
then
i
will
go
now
she
began
but
instantly
stopped
like
the
others
she
heard
the
quick
trot
of
a
horse
and
the
sound
of
rapid
wheels
approaching
from
the
lodge
who
on
earth
can
this
be
cried
margaret
blanching
visibly
the
vehicle
a
drew
nearer
they
all
went
to
the
window
even
the
indifferent
robert
rose
and
joined
them
helen
startled
them
by
running
out
to
the
side
of
the
drive
this
time
i
am
not
mistaken
she
cried
hysterically
it
is
davie
the
proceedings
of
the
gentleman
who
jumped
from
the
left
no
doubt
on
the
point
he
brazenly
kissed
her
and
in
her
excitement
she
seemed
to
like
it
she
evidently
whispered
something
to
him
for
his
first
words
to
brett
were
how
did
you
find
out
but
the
barrister
was
not
anxious
to
let
the
cousin
from
argentina
into
the
secret
of
the
search
for
him
i
have
found
out
nothing
he
interrupted
i
have
been
at
beechcroft
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
meanwhile
you
must
be
surprised
to
meet
robert
here
so
unexpectedly
david
luckily
grasped
his
friend
intention
such
information
as
he
possessed
must
wait
until
they
were
alone
how
d
do
bob
he
said
frankly
holding
out
his
hand
why
have
you
left
us
alone
all
those
years
to
turn
up
at
last
in
this
queer
way
the
young
man
kind
greeting
his
manly
attitude
had
an
effect
robert
ignored
the
proffered
hand
he
reached
for
his
hat
i
feel
like
a
beastly
interloper
he
growled
huskily
accept
my
apologies
margaret
and
you
miss
layton
i
will
call
in
the
morning
brett
if
you
still
hold
to
your
offer
i
will
await
you
at
the
lodge
or
any
other
place
you
care
to
name
with
blazing
eyes
and
mouth
firmly
set
he
endeavoured
to
reach
the
open
window
brett
barred
his
way
sit
down
man
he
said
sternly
why
are
you
such
a
fool
as
to
resist
the
kindness
offered
to
you
i
tried
to
make
matters
easy
for
you
now
i
must
speak
plainly
you
are
weak
with
hunger
he
had
seen
what
the
others
had
missed
the
colour
in
robert
face
was
due
to
exposure
but
he
was
otherwise
drawn
and
haggard
his
clothes
were
shabby
he
had
walked
from
stowmarket
because
he
could
not
afford
to
hire
any
means
of
conveyance
the
abject
confession
compelled
by
brett
words
was
too
much
for
him
he
again
collapsed
into
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
chapter
xvi
the
cousins
brett
was
the
only
person
present
who
kept
his
senses
margaret
was
too
shocked
the
lovers
too
amazed
to
speak
coherently
has
allowed
himself
to
become
run
down
said
the
barrister
with
the
nonchalance
of
one
who
discussed
the
prospects
of
weather
what
he
needs
at
the
moment
is
some
soup
and
a
few
biscuits
you
capella
might
procure
these
without
bringing
the
servants
here
especially
if
miss
layton
were
to
help
you
without
a
word
the
two
ladies
quitted
the
room
robert
looked
up
you
ring
like
good
metal
he
said
to
the
barrister
is
there
any
liquor
in
the
i
feel
a
trifle
hollow
about
the
belt
a
drink
would
do
me
good
not
until
you
have
eaten
something
first
was
the
firm
answer
are
you
so
hard
up
that
you
could
not
buy
food
well
the
fact
is
i
have
been
on
my
beam
ends
during
the
past
week
i
pawned
a
silver
watch
but
unfortunately
returned
to
my
lodgings
where
my
landlady
made
such
a
fiendish
row
about
the
bill
that
i
gave
her
every
penny
then
i
pawned
my
overcoat
raising
the
exact
fare
to
stowmarket
i
could
not
even
pay
for
a
from
gower
street
to
liverpool
street
all
i
have
eaten
was
a
humble
breakfast
at
and
i
suppose
the
sun
and
the
journey
wore
me
out
still
you
must
be
jolly
sharp
to
see
what
was
the
matter
i
thought
i
kept
my
end
up
pretty
well
david
sat
down
by
his
side
forgive
me
old
chap
continued
robert
it
broke
me
up
to
see
that
you
were
happy
after
all
your
troubles
you
are
engaged
to
a
nice
girl
alan
is
dead
i
am
the
only
unlucky
member
of
the
family
the
man
was
talking
quite
sincerely
he
even
envied
his
murdered
cousin
nothing
in
his
words
his
suspicious
mode
of
announcing
his
presence
the
vague
doubts
that
shadowed
his
past
career
puzzled
brett
so
greatly
as
that
chance
phrase
the
ladies
came
back
laden
with
good
things
from
the
kitchen
which
they
insisted
on
carrying
themselves
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
servants
all
women
are
born
actresses
their
behaviour
before
the
domestics
left
the
impression
that
some
huge
joke
was
toward
in
the
library

tactful
barrister

and
helen
outside
to
discuss
immediate
arrangements
david
promised
faithfully
to
return
from
the
rectory
in
fifteen
minutes
and
brett
the
library
robert
gave
evidence
of
his
he
tried
to
disguise
his
eagerness
but
in
vain
biscuits
sandwiches
and
soup
vanished
rapidly
until
margaret
suggested
a
further
supply
no
rita
said
her
cousin
i
have
fasted
too
often
on
the
pampas
not
to
know
the
folly
of
eating
too
heartily
i
will
be
all
right
now
especially
when
brett
produces
the
whisky
he
spoke
about
the
barrister
brought
a
decanter
from
the
the
stranger
was
still
an
enigma
he
placed
bottle
and
glass
on
the
table
wondering
to
what
extent
the
man
would
help
himself
the
quantity
was
small
and
well
diluted
so
this
member
of
the
family
was
not
a
drunkard
how
did
you
come
to
be
in
such
a
state
asked
margaret
nervously
it
is
hardly
six
months
since
i
sent
you
not
a
very
large
sum
i
admit
but
all
you
asked
me
for
and
more
than
enough
to
live
on
for
a
much
longer
period
robert
laughed
pleasantly
it
was
the
first
token
of
returning
confidence
he
reached
for
a
cigar
and
sought
margaret
permission
to
smoke
my
dear
girl
he
answered
i
am
really
a
very
unfortunate
person
i
own
a
hundred
thousand
acres
of
the
best
land
in
south
america
and
i
have
been
in
england
nearly
two
years
trying
to
raise
capital
to
develop
it
if
i
owned
a
salted
reef
or
an
american
brewery
i
could
have
got
the
money
for
the
asking
because
my
proposition
is
a
sound
paying
concern
requiring
a
delay
of
at
least
three
years
before
a
penny
of
profit
can
be
realised
i
have
worn
my
boots
out
in
climbing
up
and
down
office
stairs
to
no
purpose
out
of
your
nearly
went
out
at
once
to
pay
arrears
of
government
taxation
to
save
my
property
of
the
remaining
hundred
i
spent
fifty
in
a
fortnight
on
dinners
and
suppers
given
to
a
gang
of
scoundrels
who
i
found
subsequently
were
not
worth
a
red
cent
they
hoped
to
fleece
me
in
some
way
and
their
very
association
discredited
me
in
the
eyes
of
one
or
two
honest
men
oh
i
have
had
a
bad
time
of
it
i
can
assure
you
why
did
you
not
write
to
me
again
he
looked
at
her
steadily
before
he
explained
because
you
are
a
woman
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
am
your
relative
and
rich
how
much
do
you
want
if
your
scheme
is
really
sound
i
imagine
my
solicitors
might
sanction
my
again
he
hesitated
thank
you
rita
you
are
a
good
sort
but
i
am
not
here
on
a
matter
of
high
finance
i
want
you
to
lend
me
say
i
will
return
to
the
argentine
and
take
twenty
years
to
accomplish
what
i
could
do
in
five
with
the
necessary
capital
come
and
see
me
in
the
morning
the
sum
you
name
is
absurdly
small
in
any
case
perhaps
brett
will
accompany
you
his
advice
will
be
useful
to
both
of
us
come
early
i
leave
here
going
away
where
to
to
whitby
in
yorkshire
well
that
is
curious
said
robert
who
clearly
did
not
like
to
question
her
about
her
husband
capella
is
in
naples
she
added
i
can
not
say
when
he
will
return
her
cousin
look
was
eloquent
of
his
thoughts
he
did
not
like
the
italian
for
some
inexplicable
reason
for
to
margaret
knowledge
they
had
never
met
the
barrister
naturally
did
not
interfere
in
this
family
conclave
he
listened
intently
and
had
already
drawn
several
inferences
from
the
words
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
classify
robert
the
man
was
either
a
consummate
scoundrel
the
murderer
of
margaret
brother
or
a
maligned
and
man
within
a
few
minutes
he
would
be
called
upon
to
treat
him
in
one
category
or
the
other
a
few
questions
might
elucidate
matters
considerably
the
hiatus
in
the
conversation
created
by
the
mention
of
capella
gave
him
an
opportunity
did
you
endeavour
to
raise
the
requisite
capital
for
your
estate
in
london
only
he
inquired
no
i
tried
elsewhere
was
the
quick
rejoinder
here
for
instance
on
the
new
year
eve
before
last
now
how
the
blazes
did
you
learn
that
came
the
fierce
demand
the
speaker
excitement
rendering
him
careless
of
the
words
he
used
it
is
true
then
yes
but
robert
margaret
voice
was
choking
and
her
face
was
woefully
white
once
more
were
you
here
when
alan
was
killed
no
not
exactly
this
thing
bewilders
me
let
me
explain
i
saw
him
that
afternoon
we
had
a
furious
quarrel
i
never
told
you
about
it
rita
it
was
a
family
matter
i
do
not
hold
you
responsible
i
hold
me
responsible
what
do
you
mean
did
you
kill
my
brother
she
rose
to
her
feet
her
eyes
seemed
to
peer
into
his
soul
he
too
rose
and
faced
her
by
god
he
cried
this
is
too
much
why
did
you
ask
your
husband
that
question
because
my
husband
with
all
his
faults
is
innocent
of
that
crime
he
was
with
me
in
london
the
night
that
alan
met
his
death
and
i
too
was
in
london
i
left
stowmarket
at
six
having
reached
the
place
at
interposed
brett
the
other
turned
to
him
with
eager
pleading
in
heaven
name
brett
if
you
know
all
about
my
movements
that
day
disabuse
margaret
mind
of
the
terrible
idea
that
prompted
her
question
why
did
you
come
here
on
that
occasion
the
truth
must
out
now
my
two
uncles
swindled
my
father
that
is
margaret
your
father
led
my
uncle
david
with
him
in
a
most
unjust
proceeding
my
father
took
up
some
risky
business
in
city
finance
on
the
verbal
understanding
with
his
brothers
that
they
would
share
profits
or
bear
losses
equally
the
speculation
failed
and
your
father
basely
withdrew
from
the
compact
persuading
the
other
brother
to
follow
his
lead
perhaps
there
may
have
been
some
justification
for
his
action
but
my
poor
old
dad
was
very
bitter
about
it
the
affair
killed
him
i
made
my
own
way
in
the
world
and
came
here
to
ask
alan
to
undo
the
wrong
done
years
ago
and
help
me
to
get
on
my
feet
he
was
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
we
fell
out
badly
using
silly
recriminations
i
went
back
to
london
and
next
day
travelled
to
monte
carlo
where
i
lost
more
money
than
i
could
afford
believe
me
i
never
even
knew
of
alan
death
until
i
saw
the
reports
of
davie
trial
why
did
you
not
come
forward
then
why
no
man
could
have
better
reasons
first
it
seemed
to
me
that
davie
had
killed
him
then
when
the
second
trial
ended
i
came
to
the
conclusion
lord
help
my
wits
that
there
was
some
underhanded
work
about
the
succession
to
the
property
and
my
doubts
appeared
to
receive
confirmation
by
the
news
of
margaret
marriage
in
any
case
if
i
turned
up
to
give
evidence
i
could
only
have
helped
to
hang
one
of
my
own
relatives
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
you
might
be
suspected
never
on
my
honour
the
suggestion
is
preposterous
you
seem
to
know
everything
tell
margaret
that
i
did
leave
stowmarket
by
the
train
i
named
that
i
stayed
in
the
hotel
victoria
the
same
night
and
left
for
the
riviera
at
next
day
margaret
do
you
believe
me
you
and
i
were
sweethearts
as
children
can
you
think
i
murdered
your
brother
why
dear
girl
i
refrained
from
seeing
your
husband
lest
i
should
wound
you
by
revealing
my
thoughts
he
placed
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looked
at
her
with
such
genuine
emotion
that
she
lifted
her
swimming
eyes
to
his
and
faltered
forgive
me
robert
though
i
can
never
forgive
myself
your
words
shocked
me
i
am
sorry
i
am
not
mistaken
now
you
are
innocent
as
i
am
you
have
also
convinced
me
frazer
said
brett
quietly
robert
gazed
quickly
from
one
to
the
other
then
he
laughed
constrainedly
i
have
been
accused
of
several
offences
in
my
time
he
said
but
this
notion
that
got
into
your
heads
licks
creation
what
is
the
matter
now
said
david
hume
entering
through
the
window
chapter
xvii
cherchez
la
femme
the
three
men
drove
to
stowmarket
in
the
same
vehicle
the
grooms
returning
in
the
second
on
the
way
robert
frazer
who
may
be
designated
by
his
second
surname
to
distinguish
him
from
his
cousin
was
anxious
to
learn
what
had
caused
the
present
recrudescence
of
inquiry
into
alan
death
this
was
easily
explained
by
david
and
brett
took
care
to
confine
the
conversation
to
general
details
frazer
was
naturally
keen
to
discover
how
the
barrister
came
to
be
so
well
posted
in
his
movements
and
david
listened
eagerly
whilst
brett
related
enough
of
the
stationmaster
story
to
clear
up
that
point
hume
broke
in
with
a
laugh
that
shows
why
he
was
so
unusually
attentive
when
i
arrived
this
evening
he
spotted
me
getting
out
of
the
train
and
would
not
leave
me
until
i
was
clear
of
the
station
he
was
evidently
determined
to
ascertain
my
exact
identity
without
any
mistake
for
he
began
by
asking
if
i
were
not
david
laying
stress
on
my
christian
name
it
surprised
me
a
little
because
i
thought
the
old
chap
knew
me
well
are
you
both
absolutely
certain
that
there
are
no
other
members
of
your
family
in
existence
asked
brett
it
depends
on
how
many
of
our
precious
collection
you
are
acquainted
with
said
robert
the
only
person
brett
is
not
acquainted
with
is
my
father
exclaimed
david
stiffly
i
was
not
alluding
to
him
of
course
indeed
i
had
no
individual
specially
in
my
mind
surely
you
had
some
motive
for
your
remark
questioned
david
the
only
remaining
relative
is
mrs
capella
there
again
how
do
you
define
the
word
i
suppose
brett
you
are
fairly
well
posted
in
the
history
of
our
house
yes
well
has
it
never
struck
you
that
there
was
something
queer
about
the
manner
of
my
uncle
alan
marriage
margaret
father
i
mean
perhaps
what
do
you
know
about
it
nothing
definite
when
i
was
a
on
board
the
i
have
a
lively
recollection
of
a
fiendish
row
between
a
man
named
somers
and
another
officer
who
passed
some
chaffing
remark
about
my
respected
uncle
goings
on
in
italy
the
officer
in
question
had
forgotten
or
never
knew
that
sir
alan
married
somers
sister
they
were
bristol
people
i
think
but
he
stuck
to
it
that
sir
alan
had
an
italian
wife
he
had
seen
her
brett
was
driving
frazer
sitting
by
his
side
and
david
leaning
over
the
rail
from
the
back
seat
had
a
bombshell
dropped
in
their
midst
the
two
others
could
not
have
been
more
startled
than
by
robert
chance
observation
good
heavens
cried
hume
why
has
capella
gone
to
italy
that
question
may
soon
be
answered
said
brett
was
that
one
of
the
other
reasons
you
hinted
at
in
the
library
when
telling
us
why
you
did
not
volunteer
evidence
at
the
trial
he
asked
robert
it
was
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
now
i
did
not
know
where
the
affair
might
end
so
i
held
my
tongue
it
also
accounts
for
my
unwillingness
to
meet
capella
i
am
very
fond
of
margaret
she
is
straight
as
a
die
and
i
would
not
do
anything
to
cause
her
suffering
in
a
word
i
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
if
you
can
manage
your
matrimonial
affairs
without
all
this
fuss
davie
i
should
advise
you
to
do
the
same
what
are
you
hinting
at
what
new
mystery
is
this
cried
hume
let
us
keep
to
solid
fact
for
the
present
interposed
the
barrister
i
wish
i
had
met
you
sooner
frazer
i
would
be
nearing
naples
now
instead
of
entering
stowmarket
have
you
any
further
information
none
whatever
even
what
i
have
told
you
is
the
recollection
of
a
boy
who
did
not
understand
what
the
row
was
about
where
does
it
lead
us
anyhow
what
is
known
about
capella
very
little
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
he
will
soon
tell
us
a
good
deal
himself
i
am
beginning
to
credit
him
with
the
possession
of
more
brains
and
powers
of
malice
than
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
admit
he
is
a
dangerous
customer
look
here
exclaimed
robert
angrily
if
that
wretched
little
italian
annoys
margaret
in
any
way
i
will
crack
his
doll
head
they
reached
the
hotel
where
a
room
was
obtained
for
frazer
and
david
undertook
to
equip
him
out
of
his
portmanteau
brett
left
the
cousins
to
arrange
matters
and
hurried
to
his
where
a
number
of
telegrams
awaited
him
those
from
hume
he
barely
glanced
at
david
could
tell
his
own
story
there
were
three
from
winter
the
first
despatched
at
read
capella
and
valet
left
by
club
train
nothing
doing
japanese
the
second
was
timed
jap
accompanied
by
tall
fat
man
left
home
they
separated
piccadilly
circus
followed
jap
oh
winter
groaned
brett
and
saw
him
enter
british
museum
four
he
met
fat
man
again
outside
tottenham
court
road
tube
station
they
drove
west
in
hansom
heard
address
given
am
wiring
before
going
same
place
this
telegram
had
been
handed
in
at
an
oxford
street
office
the
third
nothing
important
all
quiet
wiring
before
your
local
office
closes
the
facetious
winter
had
signed
these
messages
snow
brett
promptly
wrote
a
telegram
to
the
detective
private
address
your
signature
should
have
been
if
that
fat
man
turns
up
again
follow
him
call
on
jap
and
endeavour
to
see
his
wife
you
may
be
sadder
but
wiser
meet
me
victoria
street
he
called
a
waiter
and
gave
instructions
that
this
message
should
be
sent
off
early
next
morning
then
he
lit
a
cigar
to
soothe
his
disappointment
i
can
not
emulate
the
house
of
commons
bird
he
mused
or
at
this
moment
i
would
be
close
to
jiro
flat
in
kensington
and
at
the
same
time
crossing
lombardy
in
an
express
what
an
ass
winter
is
to
be
sure
whenever
a
subtle
stroke
requires
an
ingenious
guard
jiro
dresses
his
wife
in
male
attire
and
sends
her
on
an
errand
he
dare
not
perform
himself
the
fact
that
they
depart
together
from
their
residence
is
diplomatic
in
itself
if
they
are
followed
the
watcher
is
sure
to
shadow
jiro
and
leave
his
unknown
friend
just
imagine
winter
dodging
jiro
around
the
rosetta
stone
or
the
phoebus
apollo
whilst
the
woman
is
visiting
some
one
or
some
place
of
infinite
value
to
our
search
it
is
positively
maddening
perhaps
in
his
heart
brett
felt
that
winter
was
not
so
greatly
to
blame
the
sudden
appearance
on
the
scene
of
a
portly
and
respectable
stranger
was
disconcerting
but
could
hardly
serve
as
an
excuse
for
leaving
trail
at
the
point
of
bifurcation
moreover
it
is
difficult
to
suspect
stout
people
of
criminal
tendencies
winter
had
the
best
of
negative
evidence
that
they
are
not
adapted
for
treasons
spoils
and
stratagems
even
a
convicted
rogue
if
corpulent
demands
sympathy
but
brett
was
very
sore
he
stamped
about
the
room
and
kicked
unoffending
chairs
out
of
the
way
his
unfailing
instinct
told
him
that
a
rare
opportunity
had
been
lost
it
was
well
for
winter
that
he
was
beyond
reach
of
the
barrister
tongue
a
valid
defence
would
have
availed
him
naught
david
entered
i
just
seized
an
opportunity
he
commenced
eagerly
but
brett
levelled
his
cigar
at
him
as
if
it
were
a
revolver
you
want
to
tell
me
he
cried
that
before
you
were
two
hours
in
portsmouth
you
ascertained
frazer
address
from
an
old
friend
you
caught
the
next
train
for
london
went
to
his
lodgings
encountered
a
nagging
landlady
and
found
that
your
cousin
had
taken
his
overcoat
to
the
pawnbroker
to
raise
money
for
his
fair
to
stowmarket
you
drove
frantically
to
liverpool
street
interviewed
a
smart
platform
inspector
and
he
told
you
that
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
ask
brett
and
he
would
not
only
give
me
a
detailed
history
of
my
own
actions
but
produce
the
very
man
he
sent
me
in
search
of
interrupted
david
laughing
nothing
the
barrister
said
or
did
could
astonish
him
now
what
has
upset
you
he
went
on
i
hope
i
made
no
mistakes
none
your
conduct
has
been
irreproachable
but
you
erred
greatly
in
the
choice
of
your
parents
there
are
far
too
many
in
existence
please
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
read
those
brett
tossed
the
detective
telegrams
across
the
table
hume
puzzled
over
them
i
think
we
ought
to
know
who
that
fat
man
was
he
said
we
do
know
she
is
a
fat
woman
the
from
ipswich
next
time
they
will
send
out
the
youthful
jiro
in
a
perambulator
but
why
are
you
so
furious
about
it
demanded
hume
was
it
so
important
to
ascertain
what
she
did
during
that
hour
and
a
quarter
important
it
is
the
only
real
clue
given
us
since
jack
saw
a
man
like
you
standing
motionless
in
the
avenue

further
complications
brett
devoted
half
an
hour
to
frazer
business
affairs
next
morning
david
was
present
and
the
result
of
the
conclave
is
shown
by
the
following
excerpt
from
a
letter
the
barrister
sent
by
them
to
capella
incidentally
excusing
his
personal
attendance
at
the
hall
in
my
opinion
your
cousin
david
and
you
should
guarantee
the
payment
of
the
on
frazer
estate
per
annum
for
five
years
you
should
give
him
a
reasonable
sum
to
rehabilitate
his
wardrobe
and
pay
the
few
small
debts
he
has
contracted
besides
allowing
him
a
weekly
stipend
to
enable
him
to
live
properly
for
another
year
i
will
place
him
in
touch
with
sound
financial
people
who
will
exploit
his
estate
if
they
think
the
prospects
are
good
and
you
can
in
the
scheme
if
you
are
so
advised
by
your
solicitors
with
whom
the
financiers
i
recommend
will
carry
weight
failing
support
in
england
frazer
says
he
can
make
his
own
way
in
the
argentine
if
helped
in
the
manner
i
suggest
he
explained
to
the
two
young
men
that
his
movements
that
day
would
be
uncertain
if
the
ladies
still
adhered
to
their
resolve
to
proceed
to
london
forthwith
the
whole
party
would
stay
at
the
same
hotel
in
that
event
they
should
send
a
telegram
to
his
victoria
street
chambers
and
he
would
dine
with
them
otherwise
they
must
advise
him
of
their
whereabouts
left
to
himself
he
curled
up
in
an
knotting
legs
and
arms
in
the
most
uncomfortable
manner
and
rendering
it
necessary
to
crane
his
neck
before
he
could
remove
a
cigar
from
his
lips
in
such
posture
alternated
with
rapid
walking
about
the
room
he
could
think
best
the
waiter
not
knowing
that
the
barrister
had
remained
in
the
hotel
came
in
to
see
what
trifles
might
be
strewed
about
table
or
mantelpiece
in
the
shape
of
loose
smokes
or
broken
hundreds
of
cigarettes
like
most
people
his
eyes
could
only
observe
the
expected
the
normal
no
one
was
standing
or
sitting
in
the
usual
way
therefore
the
room
was
empty
a
box
of
brett
turkish
cigarettes
was
lying
temptingly
open
he
advanced
touch
those
and
i
slay
you
snapped
brett
your
miserable
life
is
not
worth
one
of
them
the
man
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
fired
at
the
barrister
coiled
up
like
a
glared
at
him
in
mock
fury
i
beg
pardon
sir
he
blurted
out
i
did
know
you
was
in
evidently
a
more
expert
scoundrel
would
have
stolen
them
under
my
very
nose
you
are
a
bungler
i
really
was
goin
to
take
any
sir
just
put
them
away
that
is
all
in
that
packet
said
brett
there
are
cigarettes
i
count
them
because
each
one
is
an
epoch
i
do
count
the
cigars
in
the
sideboard
i
prefer
cigars
grinned
the
waiter
so
i
see
you
have
two
of
the
landlord
best
in
the
left
pocket
of
your
waistcoat
at
this
moment
well
if
you
ai
a
fair
scorcher
the
man
gasped
what
you
rascal
would
you
call
me
names
brett
writhed
convulsively
and
the
waiter
backed
towards
the
door
no
sir
i
was
callin
no
names
we
do
get
too
many
perks
we
waiters
do
sir
i
was
out
of
bed
until
one
and
up
again
at
six
wot
i
call
hard
work
sir
it
is
outrageous
take
five
cigars
thank
you
kindly
sir
what
kept
you
up
till
one
gossip
sir
just
silly
gossip
all
about
capella
an
beechcroft
an
i
do
know
wot
indeed
and
who
was
so
interested
in
these
topics
as
to
spoil
your
beauty
sleep
the
new
gentleman
who
is
so
like
mr
david
how
very
interesting
said
the
barrister
who
certainly
did
not
expect
this
revelation
it
seemed
to
be
interesting
to
sir
you
see
the
is
pretty
full
and
when
you
brought
last
night
sir
the
bookkeeper
the
room
next
to
mine
last
thing
i
fetched
the
gentleman
a
scotch
an
soda
an
a
cigar
said
could
sleep
and
was
lookin
at
a
fotygraf
i
caught
a
squint
at
it
an
i
sez
parding
sir
but
that
capella
miss
margaret
as
used
to
be
that
started
you
surprise
me
and
the
gentleman
surprised
me
confided
the
waiter
whose
greatest
conversational
effects
were
produced
by
quickly
adapting
remarks
made
to
him
you
are
not
aware
sir
that
the
lady
ai
no
good
i
have
heard
something
of
the
sort
then
you
heard
something
right
sir
they
do
say
as
beats
her
the
scoundrel
scoundrel
you
should
seen
no
last
night
when
i
tole
that
my
conscience
went
on
awful
did
seemed
to
be
mad
about
mrs
capella
he
is
her
cousin
cousin
that
wo
wash
sir
beggin
your
pardon
you
an
me
knows
better
than
that
i
tell
you
again
he
is
her
cousin
the
waiter
dusted
the
back
of
a
chair
well
sir
it
is
for
the
likes
of
me
to
be
contradictious
but
got
two
sisters
an
cousins
an
i
do
go
kissin
their
pictures
an
swearin
to
it
out
with
their
oh
come
now
you
are
romancing
not
a
bit
sir
when
i
went
to
my
room
i
er
is
there
a
wooden
partition
between
no
and
your
room
yes
sir
and
cracks
large
ones
yes
sir
but
why
you
should
oh
i
see
excuse
me
sir
i
thought
i
a
bell
the
waiter
hurried
off
and
brett
unwound
himself
so
robert
is
in
love
with
margaret
he
said
laughing
unmirthfully
was
there
ever
such
a
tangle
if
i
indulge
in
a
violent
flirtation
with
miss
layton
and
i
persuade
winter
to
ogle
jiro
the
affair
should
be
artistically
complete
the
conceit
brought
ipswich
to
his
mind
he
was
convinced
that
the
main
line
of
inquiry
lay
in
the
direction
of
numagawa
jiro
and
the
curious
masquerading
of
his
colossal
spouse
he
had
vaguely
intended
to
visit
the
local
police
now
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
ipswich
and
thence
to
london
further
delay
at
stowmarket
was
useless
before
his
train
quitted
the
station
he
made
matters
right
with
the
stationmaster
by
explaining
to
him
the
identity
of
the
two
men
who
had
attracted
his
attention
the
previous
evening
somehow
the
barrister
imagined
that
the
third
visitant
of
that
fateful
new
year
eve
two
years
ago
would
not
trouble
the
neighbourhood
again
herein
he
was
mistaken
at
the
county
town
he
experienced
little
difficulty
in
learning
the
antecedents
of
numagawa
jiro
in
the
first
hotel
he
entered
he
found
a
young
lady
behind
the
bar
who
was
not
only
well
acquainted
with
jiro
but
remembered
the
circumstances
of
the
courtship
the
fact
is
she
explained
there
are
a
lot
of
silly
girls
about
who
think
every
man
with
a
dark
skin
is
a
prince
in
his
own
country
if
only
he
wears
a
silk
hat
and
patent
leather
boots
is
that
all
said
brett
all
what
cried
the
girl
oh
do
be
stupid
i
mean
when
they
are
well
dressed
princess
indeed
catch
me
marrying
a
nigger
but
japanese
are
not
niggers
well
they
not
my
sort
anyhow
and
fancy
a
great
gawk
like
flossie
bird
taking
on
with
a
little
man
who
does
reach
up
to
her
elbow
it
was
simply
ridiculous
what
did
you
say
her
name
is
now
he
gave
the
required
information
and
went
on
had
jiro
any
other
friends
in
ipswich
to
your
knowledge
he
did
know
a
soul
he
was
here
for
the
assizes
about
some
case
i
think
oh
i
remember
the
mystery
and
he
stayed
at
the
hotel
where
flossie
was
engaged
how
she
ever
came
to
take
notice
of
him
i
ca
imagine
she
was
a
queer
sort
of
girl
used
to
wear
bloomers
and
get
off
her
bike
to
clout
the
small
boys
who
at
her
do
her
people
live
here
yes
and
a
rare
old
row
they
made
about
her
marriage
for
she
is
married
i
will
say
that
for
her
but
why
are
you
so
interested
in
her
the
fair
hebe
glanced
in
a
mirror
to
confirm
her
personal
opinion
that
there
were
much
nicer
girls
than
flossie
bird
left
in
ipswich
not
in
her
said
brett
in
the
example
she
set
what
do
you
mean
if
a
little
japanese
can
come
to
this
town
and
carry
off
a
lady
of
her
size
and
appearance
what
may
not
a
englishman
hope
to
accomplish
oh
go
on
he
took
her
advice
and
went
on
to
the
hotel
patronised
by
jiro
during
his
visit
to
ipswich
the
landlord
readily
showed
him
the
register
for
the
assize
week
most
of
the
guests
were
barristers
and
solicitors
many
of
them
known
personally
to
brett
none
of
the
other
names
struck
him
as
important
though
he
noted
a
few
who
arrived
on
the
same
day
as
the
japanese
mr
okasaki
he
took
the
next
train
to
london
and
reached
victoria
street
to
find
winter
awaiting
him
and
carefully
nursing
a
brown
paper
parcel
i
got
your
wire
brett
he
explained
and
this
morning
after
jiro
went
out
alone
where
did
he
go
to
the
british
museum
what
on
earth
was
he
doing
there
examining
manuscripts
my
assistant
told
me
he
was
particularly
interested
in
let
me
see
it
is
written
on
a
bit
of
paper
here
it
is
the
guai
shi
the
history
of
japan
compiled
by
rai
sanyo
between
and
containing
a
history
of
each
of
the
military
families
that
is
all
greek
to
me
but
my
man
got
the
librarian
to
jot
it
down
for
him
your
man
has
brains
what
were
you
going
to
say
when
i
interrupted
you
only
this
no
fat
companion
appeared
to
day
so
i
called
at
no
john
mansions
in
my
favourite
character
as
an
old
clo
man
the
barrister
expressed
extravagant
admiration
in
dumb
show
but
this
did
not
deceive
the
detective
who
for
some
reason
was
downcast
i
saw
jiro
and
knew
in
an
instant
that
she
was
the
stout
gentleman
who
left
her
husband
at
piccadilly
circus
yesterday
i
was
that
annoyed
i
could
hardly
do
a
deal
however
here
they
are
he
began
to
unfasten
the
string
which
fastened
the
brown
paper
parcel
here
are
what
cried
brett
jiro
coat
and
trousers
and
waistcoat
replied
winter
desperately
she
does
want
any
more
sold
for
a
song
glad
to
be
rid
of
in
fact
he
unfolded
a
suit
of
huge
dimensions
surveying
each
garment
ruefully
as
though
reproaching
it
personally
for
the
manner
in
which
it
had
deceived
him
then
brett
sat
down
and
enjoyed
a
burst
of
homeric
laughter
chapter
xix
the
third
man
appears
the
rev
wilberforce
layton
raised
no
objection
to
his
excursion
to
london
with
capella
indeed
he
promised
to
meet
them
in
whitby
a
week
later
and
remain
there
during
august
eastham
pleaded
age
and
the
school
treat
it
was
therefore
a
comparatively
youthful
party
which
brett
joined
at
dinner
in
one
of
the
great
hotels
in
northumberland
avenue
someone
had
exercised
rare
discretion
in
ordering
a
special
meal
the
wines
were
good
and
two
at
least
of
the
company
merry
as
emancipated
school
children
the
barrister
soon
received
ample
confirmation
of
the
discovery
made
by
the
stowmarket
waiter
robert
was
undoubtedly
in
love
with
his
cousin
or
to
speak
correctly
for
the
was
a
gentleman
he
had
been
in
love
with
her
as
a
boy
and
now
secretly
grieved
over
a
hopeless
passion
whether
margaret
was
conscious
of
this
devotion
or
not
brett
was
unable
to
decide
by
neither
word
nor
look
was
robert
indiscreet
when
she
was
present
he
was
lively
and
talkative
entertaining
the
others
with
snatches
of
strange
memories
drawn
from
an
adventurous
career
it
was
only
when
she
quitted
their
little
circle
that
brett
detected
the
mask
of
angry
despair
that
settled
for
a
moment
on
the
young
man
face
and
rendered
him
indifferent
to
other
influences
until
he
resolutely
aroused
himself
yet
on
the
whole
a
great
improvement
was
visible
in
frazer
attired
in
one
of
david
evening
dress
suits
carefully
groomed
and
trimmed
he
no
sooner
donned
the
garments
which
gave
him
the
outward
semblance
of
an
aristocrat
than
he
dropped
the
curt
somewhat
coarse
mannerisms
which
hitherto
distinguished
him
from
his
cousin
beyond
a
more
cosmopolitan
style
of
speech
he
was
singularly
like
david
in
person
and
deportment
they
resembled
twins
rather
than
first
cousins
they
were
both
remarkably
men
tall
wiry
and
in
splendid
condition
it
was
only
the
slightly
more
attenuated
features
of
robert
that
made
it
possible
even
for
brett
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
at
a
little
distance
helen
was
pleased
to
be
facetious
on
the
point
really
davie
she
said
now
that
your
cousin
has
come
amongst
us
you
must
remove
your
beard
at
once
why
he
asked
because
you
are
so
alike
that
some
evening
in
these
dark
corridors
i
shall
mistake
frazer
for
you
that
wo
be
half
bad
laughed
robert
nellie
blushed
and
endeavoured
to
evade
the
consequences
of
her
own
remark
i
meant
she
exclaimed
that
you
would
be
sure
to
laugh
at
me
if
i
treated
you
as
davie
not
at
all
i
would
consider
it
a
cousinly
duty
to
make
you
believe
i
was
david
and
not
myself
then
she
cried
i
will
guard
against
any
possibility
of
error
by
treating
both
of
you
as
robert
until
i
am
quite
sure
waiter
said
david
where
is
the
barber
shop
helen
became
redder
than
ever
but
they
enjoyed
the
joke
at
her
expense
the
waiter
politely
informed
his
questioner
that
the
barber
would
not
be
on
duty
until
the
morning
at
then
book
the
first
chair
for
me
said
david
and
the
second
for
me
joined
in
robert
brett
said
margaret
do
you
consider
this
competition
perfectly
disgraceful
i
am
overjoyed
he
replied
it
appears
to
me
that
the
result
must
be
personally
most
satisfactory
in
what
way
it
is
obvious
that
you
have
no
resource
but
to
accept
my
willing
slavery
miss
layton
having
monopolised
the
attentions
of
your
two
cousins
hello
cried
frazer
this
is
an
unexpected
attack
miss
layton
i
resign
have
no
fear
in
the
darkest
corridor
i
will
warn
you
that
my
name
is
though
the
words
were
carelessly
they
were
just
a
trifle
emphatic
the
incident
passed
but
they
recalled
it
subsequently
under
very
different
circumstances
brett
went
home
about
ten
next
day
at
noon
he
was
arranging
for
the
immediate
delivery
of
a
machine
sold
by
numagawa
jiro
to
a
west
end
exchange
when
a
telegram
reached
him
come
at
once
hume
he
drove
to
the
hotel
where
david
and
helen
were
sitting
in
the
foyer
awaiting
his
arrival
hume
had
kept
his
promise
anent
the
barber
he
no
longer
desired
to
alter
his
appearance
in
any
way
and
had
only
grown
a
beard
on
account
of
his
sensitiveness
regarding
his
two
trials
at
the
assizes
but
the
fun
of
the
affair
had
quite
gone
helen
was
pale
david
greatly
perturbed
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
he
said
in
a
low
voice
when
he
grasped
the
barrister
hand
someone
tried
to
kill
bob
an
hour
ago
the
blank
amazement
on
brett
face
caused
him
to
add
hurriedly
it
is
quite
true
he
had
the
narrowest
escape
he
is
in
bed
now
the
doctor
is
examining
him
we
have
secured
the
next
room
to
his
and
margaret
is
there
with
a
nurse
the
barrister
made
no
reply
but
accompanied
them
to
frazer
apartment
in
the
adjoining
room
they
found
margaret
terribly
scared
but
listening
eagerly
to
the
doctor
cheery
optimism
it
is
nothing
he
was
saying
a
severe
squeeze
some
slight
abrasions
and
a
great
nervous
shock
quite
serious
in
its
nature
although
your
friend
makes
light
of
it
and
wishes
to
get
up
at
once
i
think
however
a
nurse
entered
the
patient
insists
upon
my
leaving
the
room
she
cried
angrily
he
is
dressing
they
heard
robert
voice
confound
it
i
have
been
rolled
on
three
times
in
one
day
by
a
bucking
broncho
and
thought
nothing
of
it
i
absolutely
refuse
to
stop
in
bed
the
doctor
resigned
professional
responsibility
and
the
nature
of
margaret
cheque
caused
him
to
admit
that
to
a
man
accustomed
to
south
american
ponies
unbroken
the
nervous
shock
might
not
amount
to
much
indeed
robert
appeared
almost
immediately
and
in
a
bad
temper
i
lost
my
wind
he
explained
when
that
horse
fell
on
me
and
everyone
promptly
imagined
i
was
killed
i
hope
margaret
the
needless
excitement
of
my
appearance
on
a
stretcher
did
not
alarm
you
they
were
going
to
whip
me
off
to
the
hospital
when
i
managed
to
gurgle
out
the
name
of
the
hotel
what
happened
said
brett
the
most
extraordinary
thing
have
you
told
him
davie
no
i
attributed
your
first
words
to
me
as
being
due
to
delirium
i
had
no
idea
you
were
in
earnest
well
brett
said
frazer
sitting
down
for
notwithstanding
his
protests
he
was
somewhat
shaky
it
began
to
rain
after
breakfast
excellent
cried
the
barrister
an
englishman
in
his
sound
mind
always
starts
with
the
state
of
the
weather
i
am
sound
enough
thank
goodness
but
i
had
a
very
close
shave
laugh
davie
my
ribs
are
sore
as
the
ladies
decided
not
to
go
out
until
the
weather
took
up
davie
said
he
would
keep
them
company
whilst
i
seized
the
opportunity
to
visit
a
tailor
i
left
the
hotel
and
walked
quickly
to
the
corner
of
whitehall
it
was
hardly
worth
while
taking
a
cab
to
bond
street
and
i
intended
to
cross
in
front
of
king
charles
statue
it
is
an
awkward
place
and
a
lot
of
cabs
and
vans
were
bowling
along
downhill
from
the
strand
and
martin
church
i
waited
a
moment
on
the
kerbstone
watching
for
a
favourable
opportunity
when
suddenly
i
was
pitched
head
foremost
in
front
of
a
passing
my
escape
from
instant
death
was
solely
due
to
the
splendid
way
in
which
the
driver
handled
his
horses
and
applied
his
brake
the
near
horse
was
swung
round
so
sharp
that
he
fell
and
landed
almost
not
quite
on
the
top
of
me
i
could
feel
his
hot
reeking
body
against
my
face
and
although
the
greater
part
of
his
impact
was
borne
by
the
road
i
got
enough
to
knock
the
breath
out
of
me
you
will
see
by
the
state
of
my
clothes
in
the
other
room
how
i
was
flattened
in
the
mud
by
the
way
davie
it
is
your
suit
helen
choked
back
something
she
was
going
to
say
and
frazer
continued
a
policeman
pulled
me
from
under
the
horse
and
i
kept
my
senses
sufficiently
to
note
how
the
near
front
wheel
had
gouged
a
channel
in
the
mud
within
an
inch
or
so
of
my
head
it
went
over
my
hat
where
is
it
hume
ran
into
the
bedroom
and
returned
with
a
bowler
hat
torn
to
shreds
there
you
are
said
robert
coolly
fancy
my
head
in
that
condition
you
used
the
word
do
you
mean
that
someone
cannoned
against
you
not
a
bit
of
it
it
was
no
accident
of
a
hurrying
man
blindly
following
an
umbrella
i
have
been
a
sailor
brett
and
am
accustomed
to
maintaining
my
balance
in
a
sudden
lurch
i
do
it
intuitively
it
is
as
much
a
part
of
my
second
self
as
using
my
eyes
or
ears
with
unconscious
accuracy
some
man
a
big
powerful
man
designedly
threw
me
down
and
did
so
very
scientifically
first
pressing
his
knee
against
the
tendons
of
my
left
leg
and
then
using
his
elbow
not
one
in
a
thousand
londoners
would
know
the
trick
you
are
a
witness
pray
go
on
said
brett
being
a
sailor
however
i
did
manage
to
twist
round
slightly
as
i
fell
and
i
blessed
if
i
did
think
it
was
davie
here
who
did
it
the
barrister
keen
face
lighted
curiously
the
others
closely
watching
him
afterwards
agreed
that
he
reminded
them
of
a
greyhound
straining
after
a
luckless
hare
that
seems
to
interest
you
brett
said
frazer
i
assure
you
the
momentary
impression
was
very
distinct
my
assailant
was
dressed
like
davie
too
in
dark
blue
serge
and
wore
a
beard
for
the
moment
i
forgot
that
davie
had
visited
the
barber
this
morning
and
i
blurted
out
something
when
he
met
me
being
carried
in
through
the
hall
yes
exclaimed
hume
you
said
why
did
you
try
to
murder
me
i
was
sure
you
were
delirious
as
i
had
not
left
nellie
and
margaret
for
an
instant
since
you
went
out
that
is
so
cried
helen
margaret
uttered
no
word
she
sat
with
hands
clasped
and
pale
set
face
watching
her
cousin
as
if
his
story
had
a
mesmeric
effect
i
awfully
sorry
said
frazer
penitently
i
knew
at
once
i
was
a
fool
but
you
see
old
chap
i
remembered
you
best
as
i
had
seen
you
during
the
previous
hours
and
not
as
you
looked
at
breakfast
this
morning
do
forgive
me
but
brett
broke
in
impatiently
my
dear
fellow
your
natural
mistake
is
the
most
important
thing
that
has
happened
since
your
cousin
alan
met
his
death
the
man
who
attacked
you
mistook
you
in
turn
for
david
he
will
try
again
i
wonder
if
your
accident
will
be
reported
in
the
papers
yes
said
hume
a
youngster
came
to
me
inquired
all
about
robert
and
seemed
to
be
quite
sorry
he
was
not
mangled
then
it
will
be
your
affair
next
time
keep
a
close
whenever
you
are
alone
if
anyone
resembling
yourself
lays
a
hand
on
you
try
and
detain
him
at
all
costs
mr
brett
shrieked
helen
you
surely
can
not
mean
it
his
enthusiasm
had
caused
him
to
ignore
her
presence
for
the
next
five
minutes
he
was
earnestly
engaged
in
explaining
away
his
uncanny
request
chapter
xx
the
trail
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
brett
cast
a
searching
glance
along
the
line
of
waiting
hansoms
he
wanted
a
strong
horse
one
of
those
marvellous
animals
found
only
in
the
streets
of
london
which
trots
like
a
dog
slides
down
savoy
street
on
its
hind
legs
slips
in
and
out
among
the
traffic
like
an
eel
and
covers
a
steady
eight
miles
an
hour
for
a
seemingly
indefinite
period
shall
i
whistle
for
a
cab
sir
said
the
no
you
whistle
without
discrimination
replied
the
barrister
he
found
the
stamp
of
he
needed
fourth
on
the
rank
how
long
has
your
horse
been
out
of
the
stable
he
asked
the
driver
i
just
driven
him
here
sir
is
he
up
to
a
hard
day
work
the
best
tit
in
london
sir
pull
him
up
to
the
pavement
the
man
obeyed
instantly
his
three
predecessors
on
the
rank
began
a
chorus
wot
th
all
right
jimmy
wait
till
well
i
what
is
the
matter
inquired
brett
you
fellows
always
squeal
before
you
are
hurt
here
is
a
fare
each
for
you
and
he
solemnly
gave
them
a
shilling
even
then
they
were
not
satisfied
they
all
objurgated
jimmy
for
his
luck
as
he
drove
off
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
find
the
constable
who
had
been
on
point
duty
at
the
crossing
when
the
accident
happened
this
man
produced
his
containing
the
number
of
the
road
car
company
camden
town
and
victoria
the
driver
of
which
had
so
cleverly
avoided
a
catastrophe
the
policeman
knew
nothing
of
events
prior
to
the
falling
of
the
horse
there
was
the
usual
crowd
of
hurrying
people
the
scream
of
a
startled
woman
a
rush
of
sightseers
and
the
rescue
of
frazer
from
beneath
the
prostrate
animal
did
you
chance
to
notice
the
destination
of
the
omnibus
immediately
preceding
the
road
car
vehicle
said
brett
yes
sir
it
was
an
atlas
have
you
noted
the
exact
time
the
accident
occurred
here
it
is
sir
at
victoria
he
was
lucky
in
hitting
upon
the
camden
town
itself
drawn
up
outside
the
district
railway
station
waiting
its
turn
to
enter
the
enclosure
the
driver
was
a
sharp
fellow
and
disinclined
to
answer
questions
brett
might
be
an
emissary
of
the
enemy
but
a
handsome
tip
and
the
assurance
that
a
very
substantial
present
would
be
forwarded
to
his
address
by
the
friends
of
the
gentleman
whose
life
he
saved
unloosed
his
tongue
i
never
did
see
anything
like
it
sir
he
confided
the
road
was
quite
clear
an
i
was
bowlin
along
to
get
the
inside
berth
from
a
general
just
behind
when
this
yer
gent
was
chucked
under
the
i
would
ha
thort
was
a
suicide
if
i
seed
a
bloke
shove
orf
the
kerb
oh
you
saw
that
did
you
could
it
sir
i
was
lookin
aht
for
fares
jack
my
mate
sawr
it
too
the
conductor
thus
appealed
to
confirmed
the
statement
they
both
described
the
assailant
as
very
like
his
victim
in
size
appearance
and
garments
jack
said
he
could
do
nothing
because
the
sudden
swerving
of
the
the
fall
of
the
horse
and
the
instant
gathering
of
a
crowd
prevented
him
from
making
the
attempt
to
grab
the
other
man
who
vanished
he
believed
down
whitehall
you
did
not
tell
the
police
about
the
assault
inquired
brett
not
me
said
the
driver
the
poor
chap
in
the
road
was
not
much
i
knew
that
though
the
mob
thort
was
a
dead
an
wot
does
it
mean
a
day
lost
in
the
an
a
day
lost
on
my
too
well
said
brett
the
twist
you
gave
to
the
reins
this
morning
meant
several
days
added
to
your
would
either
of
you
know
the
man
again
if
you
saw
him
this
needed
reflection
i
would
swear
to
was
the
driver
dictum
but
i
would
swear
to
any
man
bein
like
same
said
the
conductor
the
barrister
understood
their
meaning
which
had
not
the
general
application
implied
by
the
words
he
obtained
the
addresses
of
both
men
and
left
them
his
next
visit
was
to
an
atlas
terminus
here
he
had
to
wait
a
full
hour
before
the
arrived
that
had
passed
trafalgar
square
on
a
south
journey
at
the
conductor
remembered
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
road
car
vehicle
ran
over
a
man
sir
did
it
he
inquired
nearly
not
quite
now
i
want
you
to
fix
your
thoughts
on
the
passengers
who
entered
your
at
that
point
can
you
describe
them
the
man
smiled
it
rather
a
large
order
sir
he
said
i
been
past
there
twice
since
if
it
anybody
you
know
particular
and
you
tell
me
what
he
was
like
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
brett
would
have
preferred
the
conductor
own
unaided
statement
but
seeing
no
help
for
it
he
gave
the
man
a
detailed
description
of
david
hume
plus
the
beard
has
he
got
black
snaky
eyes
and
high
the
conductor
inquired
thoughtfully
the
barrister
had
described
a
fair
man
with
brown
hair
and
the
question
in
no
way
indicated
the
colour
of
the
eyes
yet
the
odd
combination
caught
his
attention
yes
he
said
that
may
be
the
man
well
sir
i
did
pick
him
up
there
but
i
dropped
him
there
at
nine
i
picked
him
up
at
the
elephant
and
noticed
him
particular
because
he
did
pay
the
fare
for
the
whole
journey
but
took
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
would
you
know
him
again
among
a
thousand
he
had
a
funny
look
and
never
spoke
just
shoved
a
penny
out
whenever
i
came
on
top
twice
i
had
to
refuse
it
was
he
a
foreigner
not
to
my
idea
he
looked
like
a
scotchman
do
you
know
him
sir
not
yet
i
hope
to
make
his
acquaintance
can
you
remember
the
which
was
in
front
of
you
at
whitehall
at
yes
i
can
tell
you
that
it
was
a
monster
pimlico
the
conductor
is
a
friend
of
mine
named
tomkins
that
is
the
only
time
i
have
seen
him
at
the
monster
pimlico
after
another
delay
tomkins
was
produced
again
brett
described
david
hume
adorned
now
with
black
snaky
eyes
and
high
of
course
said
tomkins
i
spotted
came
aboard
wiv
a
run
just
arter
a
hoss
fell
in
front
of
the
statoo
gim
me
a
penny
did
jumped
orf
at
the
guards
without
a
ticket
afore
we
gone
a
yards
i
thort
was
frightened
or
dotty
i
did
know
agin
ra
ther
eyes
like
gimlets
the
barrister
regained
the
seclusion
of
the
hansom
st
john
mansions
kensington
he
said
to
the
driver
and
then
he
curled
up
on
the
seat
in
the
most
uncomfortable
attitude
permitted
by
the
construction
of
the
vehicle
on
nearing
his
destination
he
stopped
the
cab
at
a
convenient
corner
i
want
you
to
wait
here
for
my
return
he
told
the
driver
how
long
will
you
be
sir
not
more
than
fifteen
minutes
i
only
asked
sir
because
i
wanted
to
know
if
i
had
time
to
give
the
horse
a
feed
cabby
was
evidently
quite
convinced
that
his
eccentric
fare
was
not
a
bilker
brett
glanced
around
in
the
neighbouring
street
was
a
which
possessed
what
the
agents
call
a
good
trade
he
pointed
to
it
i
think
he
said
if
you
wait
there
it
will
be
more
comfortable
for
you
and
equally
good
for
the
horse
the
cabby
pocketed
an
interim
tip
with
a
grin
i
struck
it
rich
he
murmured
as
he
disappeared
through
a
swing
door
bearing
the
legend
tap
in
huge
letters
meanwhile
brett
sauntered
past
john
mansions
across
the
road
a
man
was
leaning
against
the
railings
of
a
large
garden
being
deeply
immersed
in
the
columns
of
a
sporting
paper
the
barrister
caught
his
eye
and
walked
on
a
minute
later
winter
overtook
him
not
a
move
here
all
day
he
said
in
disgust
except
appearance
with
the
perambulator
she
led
me
all
round
kensington
gardens
and
her
only
business
was
to
air
the
baby
and
cram
it
with
where
is
her
husband
in
the
house
he
has
stirred
out
since
yesterday

every
one
who

and
leaves
the
place
during
the
day
if
jiro

out
he
has
to
follow
her
until
he
sees
that

a
newsboy
came
running
along
shouting
the
late
edition
of

the
barrister
bought
a
paper
and
rapidly
glanced
through
its
contents
here

said
someone

a
good
memory
the
item

brett

northumberland
avenue
was
knocked
down
and
nearly
run
over
by
an
omnibus
in
whitehall
this
morning
the
skill
of
the
driver
averted
a
very
serious
accident
it
is
supposed
that
slipped
whilst
attempting
to
cross
before
the
policeman
on
duty
at
that
point
stopped
the
traffic
the
injured
gentleman
was
carried
to
his
hotel
where
he
is
staying
with
his
cousin
david
whose
name
will
be
recalled
in
connection
with
the
famous
mystery
of
last
year
what
does
it
all
mean
inquired
winter
it
means
that
you
must
listen
carefully
to
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
here
is
my
cab
jump
in
driver
i
am
surprised
that
a
man
of
your
intelligence
should
waste
your
money
on
a
cigar
throw
it
away
here
is
a
better
one
and
now
victoria
street
sharp
winter
ears
were
pricked
to
receive
brett
intelligence
beyond
a
sigh
of
professional
admiration
at
the
result
of
brett
pertinacity
with
regard
to
the
omnibuses
passing
through
whitehall
at
he
did
not
interrupt
until
the
barrister
had
ended
even
then
he
was
silent
so
brett
looked
at
him
in
surprise
well
winter
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
said
think
i
wish
i
had
half
your
luck
brett
he
answered
sadly
how
now
you
monster
no
i
not
jealous
you
beat
me
at
my
own
game
i
admit
it
i
would
never
have
thought
of
going
for
the
i
suppose
you
would
have
interviewed
the
driver
and
conductor
of
every
vehicle
on
that
route
before
you
gave
in
you
did
trouble
about
the
hansoms
hailing
a
cab
was
a
slow
business
and
risked
subsequent
identification
to
jump
on
to
a
moving
was
just
the
thing
yes
there
is
no
denying
that
you
are
d
d
smart
winter
your
unreasonable
jealousy
is
making
you
vulgar
would
any
man
swear
sir
why
did
i
let
such
a
handful
as
jiro
slip
through
my
fingers
the
other
day
clue
why
it
was
a
perfect
bale
of
cotton
if
i
had
only
followed
her
instead
of
that
little
rat
her
husband
we
would
now
know
where
the
third
man
lives
and
have
the
murderer
of
sir
alan
under
our
thumb
it
is
all
my
fault
though
sometimes
i
feel
inclined
to
blame
the
police
system
a
system
that
wo
even
give
us
telephones
between
one
station
and
another
never
mind
wait
till
i
tackle
the
next
job
for
the
yard
i
show
a
trick
or
two
chapter
xxi
concerning
chickens
and
motives
the
detective
cooled
off
by
the
time
they
reached
brett
flat
on
the
tables
they
found
two
telegrams
and
a
remington
the
messages
were
from
holden
naples
the
first
johnson
arrived
here
this
morning
the
second
johnson
proceedings
refer
to
poorhouse
and
church
registers
johnson
is
capella
explained
winter
i
forgot
to
tell
you
we
had
arranged
that
brett
surveyed
the
second
telegram
so
intently
that
the
detective
inquired
how
do
you
read
that
sir
capella
is
securing
copies
of
certificates
marriages
births
or
deaths
perhaps
all
three
he
is
also
getting
hold
of
living
witnesses
of
what
he
will
tell
us
himself
he
is
preparing
a
bombshell
of
sorts
it
will
explode
here
goodness
only
knows
who
will
be
blown
up
by
it
he
took
the
cover
off
the
seized
a
sheet
of
paper
and
began
to
manipulate
the
keyboard
with
the
methodical
carefulness
of
one
unaccustomed
to
its
use
he
wrote
about
stowmarket
david
hume
frazer
killed
cousin
cousin
talked
girl
in
road
girl
waited
wood
david
hume
frazer
met
girl
in
wood
after
do
you
mean
to
say
cried
the
detective
that
you
can
remember
the
anonymous
letter
word
for
word
you
have
only
seen
it
once
and
that
was
several
days
ago
not
only
word
for
word
but
the
spacing
the
number
of
words
in
a
line
the
lines
between
which
creases
appear
look
winter
here
is
the
small
broken
the
bent
capital
the
letter
out
of
register
where
is
the
original
here
in
my
they
silently
compared
the
two
typed
sheets
it
needed
no
expert
to
note
that
they
had
been
written
by
the
same
machine
it
would
take
a
clever
counsel
to
upset
that
piece
of
evidence
said
winter
i
wish
i
had
hold
of
the
writer
you
have
spoken
to
him
several
times
surely
you
can
not
mean
jiro
who
else
jiro
is
but
the
tool
of
a
superior
scoundrel
he
is
just
beginning
to
suspect
the
fact
and
trying
to
use
it
for
his
own
benefit
i
wish
i
was
in
naples
with
your
friend
holden
but
brett
the
murderer
is
in
london
what
about
this
attempt
my
dear
fellow
you
are
already
constructing
the
gallows
leave
that
to
the
gaol
officials
what
we
do
not
yet
know
is
the
motive
the
key
to
the
mystery
is
in
naples
probably
in
capella
hands
at
this
moment
if
i
were
there
it
would
be
in
mine
too
do
not
question
me
winter
i
am
not
inspired
i
can
only
indulge
in
vague
imaginings
capella
will
bring
the
reality
to
london
then
what
are
we
to
do
meanwhile
await
events
patiently
watch
jiro
with
the
calm
persistence
of
a
cat
watching
a
hole
into
which
a
mouse
has
disappeared
at
this
moment
eat
something
he
rang
for
smith
and
told
him
to
attend
to
the
wants
of
the
waiting
cabman
whilst
smith
made
the
speediest
arrangements
for
an
immediate
dinner
the
two
men
sat
down
and
winter
could
not
help
asking
another
question
why
are
you
keeping
the
cab
mr
brett
because
i
am
superstitious
the
detective
opened
wide
his
eyes
at
this
statement
i
mean
it
said
the
barrister
look
at
all
i
have
learnt
whilst
darting
about
london
in
that
particular
hansom
which
mind
you
i
carefully
selected
from
a
rank
of
twenty
abandon
it
until
i
am
dropped
at
my
never
winter
sighed
i
never
feel
that
way
about
anything
on
wheels
he
said
do
you
really
think
you
will
be
able
to
clear
up
this
affair
sir
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
bigger
muddle
now
than
when
i
left
it
after
the
second
trial
laugh
at
me
that
is
awkwardly
put
i
know
but
then
we
had
a
straightforward
crime
to
deal
with
now
goodness
knows
where
we
have
landed
smith
entered
and
commenced
laying
the
table
brett
did
not
reply
to
the
detective
spoken
reverie
both
men
idly
watched
the
deft
preparations
smith
suddenly
cried
the
master
of
the
household
what
sort
of
chicken
have
we
for
dinner
cold
chicken
sir
thank
you
as
you
seem
to
demand
miltonic
precision
in
phrase
i
amend
my
words
what
breed
of
chicken
have
we
for
dinner
a
dorking
sir
and
how
do
you
know
it
is
a
dorking
oh
there
lots
of
ways
of
knowin
that
sir
you
can
tell
by
the
size
by
its
head
and
feet
and
by
the
tuft
of
feathers
left
on
its
neck
beg
pardon
sir
i
was
only
saying
you
are
smith
went
out
and
brett
turned
to
his
companion
did
you
note
smith
philosophy
in
the
matter
of
dorkings
he
inquired
yes
does
it
convey
no
moral
to
you
i
fear
not
now
mark
me
winter
just
as
the
breed
of
the
chicken
is
indelibly
stamped
on
it
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
skilled
in
chickens
so
is
the
murder
we
are
investigating
marked
by
characteristics
so
plain
that
a
child
of
ten
properly
trained
to
use
his
eyes
might
discern
them
what
you
and
i
suffer
from
are
defects
implanted
by
idle
nursemaids
and
doting
mothers
let
us
for
the
moment
adopt
the
policy
of
the
theosophists
and
sit
in
consultation
apart
from
our
astral
bodies
who
killed
sir
alan
i
answer
a
relative
what
relative
someone
we
do
not
know
whom
he
did
not
know
or
who
committed
murder
because
he
was
known
what
sort
of
person
is
the
murderer
a
man
physically
like
either
david
or
robert
so
like
that
jack
would
swear
to
the
identity
of
either
of
them
as
readily
as
to
the
person
of
the
real
murderer
why
did
he
use
such
a
weird
instrument
as
the
because
he
found
it
under
his
hand
and
recognised
its
sinister
purpose
to
be
left
implanted
in
the
breast
or
brain
of
an
enemy
lifeless
body
where
is
the
man
now
in
london
perhaps
outside
this
building
perhaps
watching
the
northumberland
avenue
hotel
waiting
quietly
for
another
chance
to
take
the
life
of
the
person
who
caused
us
to
reopen
this
inquiry
to
sum
up
winter
let
us
find
such
an
individual
a
with
black
deadly
eyes
with
a
cold
calculating
remorseless
brain
with
a
knowledge
of
trick
and
fence
not
generally
an
attribute
of
the
race
let
us
lay
hands
on
him
i
say
and
you
can
book
him
for
kingdom
come
the
old
bailey
yes
sir
broke
in
winter
excitedly
but
the
motive
et
tu
brute
would
the
disciple
rend
his
master
have
i
not
told
you
that
capella
will
bring
that
knowledge
with
him
from
naples
i
have
hopes
even
of
your
friend
holden
giving
us
all
the
details
we
need
what
did
the
murderer
steal
from
sir
alan
from
the
drawer
broken
open
before
the
blow
was
struck
smith
entered
bearing
a
chicken
the
motive
winter
the
motive
laughed
brett
and
in
pursuance
of
his
invariable
practice
he
refused
to
say
another
word
about
the
crime
or
its
perpetrator
during
the
meal
chapter
xxii
the
second
attack
smith
was
accustomed
to
her
master
occasional
freaks
in
the
matter
of
dinner
her
husband
aided
by
long
experience
knew
whether
immediately
meant
one
minute
or
five
or
even
fifteen
this
time
he
gave
his
wife
the
longest
limit
so
in
addition
to
the
chicken
a
bird
whose
unhappy
attribute
is
a
facility
for
being
devoured
with
the
utmost
speed
a
mixed
grill
of
cutlets
bacon
and
french
sausages
appeared
on
the
table
the
diners
were
hungry
and
the
good
things
were
appreciated
it
was
well
that
they
wasted
no
time
on
mere
words
they
were
still
intent
on
the
feast
when
a
boy
messenger
brought
a
note
it
was
from
helen
written
in
pencil
david
was
coming
to
see
you
when
he
was
attacked
can
you
come
to
us
at
once
david
is
all
right
only
shaken
and
covered
with
mud
it
occurred
five
minutes
ago
dear
me
said
brett
dear
me
there
was
such
a
hiss
of
concentrated
fury
in
his
voice
that
winter
was
puzzled
to
account
for
the
harmless
expression
the
barrister
had
twice
used
the
detective
knew
that
his
distinguished
friend
never
by
any
chance
indulged
in
strong
language
yet
something
had
annoyed
him
so
greatly
that
a
more
powerful
expletive
would
have
had
a
very
natural
sound
brett
glared
at
him
it
is
evident
he
said
that
you
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
me
it
is
simply
the
english
form
of
the
italian
dio
mio
and
a
literal
translation
would
shock
you
it
does
appear
that
much
damage
has
been
done
to
your
client
gasped
winter
for
brett
had
unceremoniously
dragged
him
from
his
chair
with
the
intention
of
rushing
downstairs
forthwith
they
hurried
out
together
and
dashed
into
the
waiting
hansom
think
of
it
winter
groaned
the
barrister
whilst
we
were
seduced
by
a
dorking
and
a
french
sausage
an
unholy
alliance
the
very
man
we
wanted
was
waiting
in
northumberland
avenue
you
are
avenged
all
my
jibes
and
sneers
at
scotland
yard
recoil
on
my
own
head
i
might
have
known
that
such
a
desperate
scoundrel
would
soon
make
another
attempt
and
next
time
upon
the
right
person
you
followed
jiro
i
am
led
astray
by
a
cooked
fowl
oh
winter
winter
who
could
suspect
such
depravity
in
a
roasted
chicken
i
dashed
if
i
can
guess
what
you
driving
at
growled
the
detective
no
i
understand
the
blood
has
left
your
brain
and
gone
to
your
stomach
you
will
not
be
able
to
think
for
hours
raving
thus
in
disjointed
sentences
that
winter
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
brett
refused
to
be
explicit
until
they
reached
the
hotel
when
he
discharged
the
cabman
with
a
payment
that
caused
the
gentleman
on
the
perch
to
spit
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
in
great
glee
whilst
he
promptly
wheeled
the
horse
in
the
direction
of
his
livery
stables
they
were
met
by
david
himself
seated
in
the
foyer
by
the
side
of
helen
who
looked
white
and
frightened
this
chap
is
a
terror
began
hume
once
they
were
safe
in
the
privacy
of
their
i
would
never
have
believed
such
things
were
possible
in
london
if
they
had
not
actually
happened
to
robert
and
me
we
had
dinner
rather
early
and
dined
in
private
as
robert
is
feeling
stiff
now
after
this
morning
adventure
margaret
suggested
where
is
mrs
capella
interrupted
the
barrister
miss
layton
answered
she
is
with
frazer
they
have
found
a
quiet
corner
of
the
i
mean
the
where
ladies
go
and
we
have
not
told
them
yet
what
has
happened
to
davie
well
resumed
hume
margaret
idea
is
that
we
should
all
leave
here
for
the
north
she
wanted
you
to
approve
of
the
arrangement
so
i
got
into
a
hansom
and
started
for
your
chambers
it
was
raining
a
little
and
the
street
was
full
of
traffic
the
driver
asked
if
i
would
like
the
window
closed
but
i
would
sooner
face
a
tiger
than
drive
through
london
in
a
hansom
so
i
refused
the
middle
of
the
road
you
know
has
a
long
line
of
waiting
cabs
broken
by
occasional
the
horse
was
just
getting
into
a
trot
when
a
man
wrapped
in
a
mackintosh
ran
alongside
caught
the
off
rein
in
the
crook
of
his
stick
swung
the
poor
beast
right
round
through
one
of
the
gaps
in
the
rank
and
down
we
went
horse
cab
driver
and
myself
in
front
of
a
brewer
dray
luckily
for
me
and
the
driver
we
were
flung
right
over
the
smash
into
the
gutter
for
the
big
heavy
van
ran
into
the
fallen
hansom
crushed
it
like
a
matchbox
and
killed
the
horse
had
the
window
been
closed
well
it
was
so
there
is
no
need
for
romancing
poor
nellie
clung
to
her
lover
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
he
was
really
uninjured
did
you
see
your
assailant
clearly
unfortunately
no
the
side
windows
were
blurred
with
rain
and
i
was
trying
to
strike
a
match
the
first
thing
i
was
conscious
of
was
a
violent
swerve
i
looked
up
saw
a
tall
cloaked
figure
wrenching
at
the
reins
with
a
crooked
stick
and
over
we
went
i
fell
into
a
bed
of
mud
it
absolutely
blinded
me
i
jumped
up
and
fancying
that
the
blackguard
ran
up
northumberland
street
i
dashed
after
him
i
cannoned
against
some
and
we
both
fell
a
who
witnessed
the
affair
did
go
after
the
cause
of
it
and
received
such
a
blow
on
the
jaw
that
he
was
hardly
able
to
speak
when
found
by
a
policeman
where
is
this
man
now
with
the
cabman
in
a
small
hotel
across
the
road
i
had
not
the
nerve
to
bring
them
here
if
we
have
any
more
adventures
the
management
will
turn
us
out
i
fancy
they
think
our
behaviour
is
hardly
respectable
the
instant
robert
or
i
endeavour
to
leave
the
door
we
are
used
to
clean
up
a
portion
of
the
roadway
miss
layton
would
you
mind
joining
the
others
for
a
few
minutes
hume
is
going
out
with
winter
and
myself
the
barrister
request
took
helen
by
surprise
is
there
any
need
for
further
risk
she
faltered
moreover
margaret
will
see
at
once
that
something
has
gone
wrong
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
deception
where
where
davie
is
concerned
have
no
fear
tell
them
everything
hume
will
be
very
seriously
injured
in
morning
papers
this
expert
in
street
accidents
must
be
led
to
believe
he
has
succeeded
in
any
case
aided
by
a
miserable
fowl
he
is
far
enough
from
here
at
this
moment
we
will
return
in
twenty
minutes
the
girl
was
so
agitated
that
she
hardly
noticed
brett
words
but
their
purport
reassured
her
and
she
left
them
the
three
men
passed
out
into
the
drizzling
rain
owing
to
the
strand
being
up
a
continuous
stream
of
traffic
flowed
through
the
avenue
hume
pointed
out
the
gap
through
which
the
horse
was
forced
and
then
they
darted
across
the
roadway
i
fell
here
he
said
indicating
a
muddy
flood
of
road
scrapings
in
which
were
embedded
many
splinters
from
the
wreckage
of
the
hansom
brett
careless
of
the
amazement
he
caused
to
hurrying
pedestrians
waded
through
the
bed
of
mud
kicking
up
any
objects
encountered
by
his
feet
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
triumph
when
he
produced
a
stick
from
the
depths
i
thought
i
should
find
it
he
said
when
the
horse
fell
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
against
the
stick
being
extricated
from
the
reins
and
its
owner
could
not
wait
an
instant
you
and
the
stick
my
dear
hume
lay
close
together
a
small
crowd
was
gathering
the
barrister
laughed
gentleman
he
said
why
are
you
so
surprised
which
of
you
would
not
dirty
his
boots
to
recover
such
a
valuable
article
as
this
some
people
grinned
sympathetically
they
all
moved
away
in
an
upper
room
of
the
neighbouring
were
a
suffering
runner
and
a
disconsolate
cabby
the
runner
could
tell
them
nothing
tangible
concerning
the
man
he
pursued
i
sawr
bring
the
hoss
dahn
like
a
bullick
he
whispered
for
the
poor
fellow

received
a
terrible
blow
i
went
arter

an
gev

a

that

inquired
brett
nah
blawst
i
could
dodged
a
square
blow
i
can
use
my
dukes
a
bit
myself
what
was
the
value
of
the
punch
the
youth
tried
to
smile
though
the
effort
tortured
him
it
was
worth
a
thick
at
least
hume
gave
him
two
sovereigns
and
the
runner
could
not
have
been
more
taken
aback
had
the
donor
landed
him
on
the
sound
jaw
and
now
you
said
brett
to
the
cabman
what
did
you
see
me
with
a
snort
of
indignation
little
over
an
hour
ago
i

the
man
was
telling
the
truth
he
was
with
misery
brett
looked
at
hume
and
the
latter
rang
a
bell
he
asked
the
waiter
for
a
pen
and
ink
how
much
did
your
cab
cost
he
said
to
the
driver
who
was
so
downcast
that
he
actually
failed
to
correctly
interpret
david
action
the
question
had
to
be
repeated
before
an
answer
came
it
was
a
new
mister
i
was
just
makin
a
stawt
i
gev

it
an

i

wait
just
a
little
while
said
david
kindly
you
hardly
understand
this
business
the
madman
who
attacked
us
meant
to
injure
me
not
you
here
is
a
cheque
for
which
will
not
only
replace
your
horse
and
cab
but
leave
you
a
little
over
for
the
loss
of
your
time
winter
caught
the
dazed
cabman
by
the
shoulder
billy
he
said
you
know
me
are
you
going
home
or
going
to
get
drunk
billy
hesitated
goin
he
vociferated
me
one
moment
said
brett
surely
you
have
some
idea
of
the
appearance
of
the
rascal
who
pulled
your
horse
over
the
man
was
alternately
surveying
the
cheque
and
looking
into
the
face
of
his
benefactor
i
dunno
he
cried
after
a
pause
i
feel
a
bit
mixed
this
gentleman
acted
as
square
as
ever
man
did

of
a
good
stock

chapter

margaret
secret
the
waiter
managed
to
remove
the
most
obvious
traces
of
brett
escapade
in
the
gutter
and
incidentally
cleaned
the
stick
it
was
a
light
tough
ashplant
with
a
silver
band
around
the
handle
the
barrister
held
it
under
a
gas
jet
and
examined
it
closely
nothing
escaped
him
after
scrutinising
the
band
for
some
time
he
looked
at
the
ferrule
and
roughly
estimated
that
the
owner
had
used
it
two
or
three
years
finally
when
quite
satisfied
he
handed
it
to
winter
do
you
recognise
those
scratches
he
said
with
a
smile
pointing
out
a
rough
design
bitten
into
the
silver
by
the
application
of
aqua
regia
and
beeswax
the
detective
at
once
uttered
an
exclamation
of
supreme
astonishment
the
very
thing
he
cried
the
same
japanese
motto
as
that
on
the
hume
now
drew
near
so
he
growled
savagely
the
hand
that
struck
down
alan
was
the
same
that
sought
my
life
an
hour
ago
and
your
cousin
this
morning
said
brett
the
cowardly
brute
if
he
has
a
grudge
against
my
family
why
does
he
come
out
into
the
open
he
need
not
have
feared
detection
even
a
week
ago
i
could
be
found
easily
enough
why
did
he
meet
me
face
to
face
i
have
never
yet
run
away
from
trouble
or
danger
you
are
slightly
in
error
regarding
him
observed
brett
this
man
may
be
a
fiend
incarnate
but
he
is
no
coward
he
means
to
kill
to
work
some
terrible
purpose
and
he
takes
the
best
means
towards
that
end
to
his
mind
the
idea
of
giving
a
victim
fair
play
is
sheer
nonsense
it
never
even
occurs
to
him
but
a
coward
no
think
of
the
nerve
required
to
commit
robbery
and
murder
under
the
conditions
that
obtained
at
beechcroft
on
new
year
eve
think
of
the
skill
the
ready
resource
which
made
so
promptly
available
the
conditions
of
the
two
assaults
our
quarry
is
a
genius
a
poe
among
criminals
look
to
it
winter
that
your
handcuffs
are
well
fixed
when
you
arrest
him
or
he
will
slip
from
your
grasp
at
the
very
gates
of
scotland
yard
if
i
had
my
fingers
round
his
windpipe
began
david
you
would
be
a
dead
man
a
few
seconds
later
said
the
barrister
if
we
three
unarmed
had
him
in
this
room
now
equally
defenceless
i
should
regard
the
issue
as
doubtful
there
would
be
a
terrible
smirked
winter
possibly
but
it
would
be
a
fight
for
life
or
death
no
half
measures
a
matter
of
decanters
chairs
let
us
return
to
the
hotel
whilst
hume
went
to
summon
the
others
brett
seated
himself
at
a
table
and
wrote
a
curious
chapter
of
accidents
happened
in
northumberland
avenue
yesterday
early
in
the
morning
robert
quitted
his
hotel
for
a
stroll
in
the
west
end
and
narrowly
escaped
being
run
over
in
whitehall
about
his
cousin
david
was
driving
through
the
avenue
in
a
hansom
when
the
vehicle
upset
and
the
young
gentleman
was
thrown
out
he
was
picked
up
in
a
terrible
condition
and
is
reported
to
be
in
danger
of
his
life
the
barrister
read
the
paragraph
aloud
it
is
casuistic
he
commented
but
that
defect
is
pardonable
after
all
it
is
not
absolutely
mendacious
like
a
war
office
telegram
winter
go
and
bring
joy
to
the
heart
of
some
by
giving
him
that
item
the
will
ensure
its
acceptance
by
every
morning
paper
in
london
and
you
can
safely
leave
the
reporter
himself
to
add
details
about
hume
connection
with
the
stowmarket
affair
the
detective
rose
will
you
be
here
when
i
come
back
sir
he
asked
i
expect
so
in
any
case
you
must
follow
on
to
my
chambers
we
will
concert
our
plan
of
campaign
margaret
entered
with
helen
and
the
two
men
robert
limped
somewhat
how
d
do
brett
he
cried
cheerily
that
beggar
hurt
me
more
than
i
imagined
at
the
time
he
struck
a
tendon
in
my
left
leg
so
hard
that
it
is
quite
painful
now
brett
gave
an
answering
smile
but
his
thoughts
did
not
find
utterance
how
strange
it
was
that
two
men
so
widely
dissimilar
as
robert
and
the
vendor
of
newspapers
should
insist
on
the
skill
the
unerring
certainty
of
their
opponent
capella
he
said
wheeling
round
upon
the
lady
when
you
lived
in
london
or
on
the
continent
did
you
ever
include
any
japanese
in
the
circle
of
your
acquaintances
yes
was
the
reply
margaret
was
white
her
lips
tense
the
brilliancy
of
her
large
eyes
almost
unnatural
tell
me
about
them
what
can
i
tell
you
they
were
bright
lively
little
men
they
amused
my
friends
by
their
quaint
ideas
and
interested
us
at
times
by
recounting
incidents
of
life
in
the
east
were
they
all
was
one
of
them
a
man
of
unusual
stature
no
said
margaret
the
barrister
knew
that
she
was
profoundly
distressed
if
she
would
be
candid
with
me
he
mused
i
would
tear
the
heart
from
this
mystery
one
other
among
those
present
caught
the
hidden
drift
of
this
small
colloquy
robert
frazer
looked
sadly
at
his
cousin
natures
that
are
closely
allied
have
an
electric
sympathy
he
could
not
even
darkly
discern
the
truth
but
he
connected
brett
words
in
some
remote
way
with
capella
how
he
loathed
the
despicable
italian
who
left
his
wife
to
bear
alone
the
trouble
that
oppressed
her
who
only
went
away
in
order
to
concoct
some
villainy
against
her
margaret
could
not
face
the
barrister
thoughtful
searching
gaze
she
stood
up
like
the
others
of
her
race
when
danger
threatened
she
even
laughed
harshly
i
have
decided
she
said
to
leave
here
morning
helen
says
she
does
not
object
our
united
wardrobes
will
serve
all
needs
of
the
seaside
robert
tailor
visited
him
and
assured
him
that
the
result
would
be
satisfactory
without
any
preliminary
on
do
you
approve
mr
brett
most
heartily
i
can
hardly
believe
that
our
hidden
foe
will
make
a
further
attack
until
he
learns
that
he
has
been
foiled
again
yet
you
will
all
be
happier
and
unquestionably
safer
away
from
london
does
anyone
here
know
where
you
are
going
no
one
i
have
not
told
my
maid
or
footman
it
was
not
necessary
as
we
intended
to
remain
here
a
week
admirable
when
you
leave
the
hotel
in
the
morning
give
yarmouth
as
your
destination
not
until
you
reach
king
cross
need
you
inform
your
servants
that
you
are
really
going
to
whitby
would
you
object
to
ah
well
that
is
perhaps
difficult
i
was
about
to
suggest
an
assumed
name
but
miss
layton
father
would
object
no
doubt
if
he
did
not
i
would
said
robert
impetuously
who
has
margaret
to
fear
and
what
do
david
and
i
care
for
all
the
anonymous
scoundrels
in
creation
is
there
really
so
much
danger
that
such
a
proceeding
is
advisable
inquired
the
trembling
nellie
circumstances
speak
for
themselves
miss
layton
replied
brett
neither
you
nor
capella
run
the
least
risk
i
will
not
be
answerable
for
the
others
grave
difficulties
must
be
surmounted
before
the
power
for
further
injury
is
taken
from
the
man
we
seek
in
my
professional
capacity
i
say
act
openly
advertise
your
destination
make
it
known
that
hume
escaped
from
the
wreck
of
the
hansom
unhurt
should
the
murderer
follow
you
to
whitby
he
can
not
escape
me
here
in
london
he
is
one
among
five
millions
but
speaking
as
a
friend
i
advise
the
utmost
vigilance
unless
another
is
to
die
in
his
boots
it
was
not
helen
but
margaret
who
wailed
in
agony
do
you
really
mean
what
you
say
have
matters
reached
that
stage
yes
they
have
his
voice
was
cold
almost
stern
kindly
telegraph
your
whitby
address
to
me
he
said
to
hume
then
he
walked
to
the
door
leaving
them
brusquely
for
once
in
his
career
he
was
deeply
annoyed
confound
all
women
he
muttered
in
anger
they
nurse
some
petty
little
secret
some
childish
love
affair
and
deem
its
preservation
more
important
than
their
own
happiness
or
the
lives
of
their
best
friends
they
are
all
alike
duchess
or
their
fluttering
hearts
are
all
the
world
to
them
and
everything
else
chaos
if
that
woman
only
chose
mr
brett
came
a
clear
voice
along
the
corridor
it
was
margaret
she
came
to
him
hastily
why
do
you
suspect
me
she
exclaimed
brokenly
i
am
the
most
miserable
woman
on
earth
suffering
and
death
environ
me
and
overwhelm
those
nearest
and
dearest
yet
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
think
me
capable
of
concealing
from
you
material
facts
which
would
be
of
use
to
you
the
barrister
was
tempted
to
retort
that
what
she
believed
to
be
material
might
indeed
be
of
very
slight
service
to
him
but
the
contrary
proposition
held
good
too
then
he
saw
the
anguish
in
her
face
and
it
moved
him
to
say
gently
go
back
to
your
friends
capella
i
am
not
the
keeper
of
your
conscience
i
am
almost
sure
you
are
worrying
yourself
about
trifles
whatever
they
may
be
you
are
not
responsible
rest
assured
of
this
in
a
few
days
much
that
is
now
dim
and
troublous
will
be
cleared
up
i
ask
you
nothing
further
i
would
prefer
not
to
hear
anything
you
wish
to
say
to
me
it
might
fetter
my
hands
chapter
xxiv
the
meeting
there
he
said
to
himself
as
he
passed
downstairs
i
am
just
as
big
a
fool
as
she
is
she
followed
me
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
everything
and
i
send
her
back
with
a
request
to
keep
her
lips
sealed
yet
i
am
angry
with
her
for
the
risk
she
is
taking
he
reached
the
hall
and
was
about
to
cross
the
foyer
when
he
caught
the
words
gentleman
thrown
out
of
a
cab
uttered
by
a
handsome
girl
cheaply
but
gaudily
attired
who
was
making
some
inquiry
at
the
bureau
he
stopped
and
searched
for
a
match
then
he
became
interested
in
the
latest
news
pinned
in
strips
on
the
board
of
a
ticker
the
girl
explained
to
an
official
that
she
had
witnessed
an
accident
that
evening
she
was
told
that
a
gentleman
who
lived
in
the
hotel
was
hurt
was
he
seriously
injured
the
hotel
man
from
long
practice
was
enabled
to
sum
up
such
inquirers
rapidly
do
you
know
the
gentleman
he
inquired
no
that
is
slightly
well
madam
if
you
give
me
your
card
i
will
send
it
to
his
friends
they
will
give
you
all
necessary
information
she
became
confused
she
was
not
accustomed
to
the
quiet
elegance
of
a
great
hotel
the
men
in
evening
dress
the
gorgeously
attired
ladies
passing
to
elevator
or
seemed
to
be
listening
to
her
why
did
the
bureau
keeper
speak
so
loudly
then
the
assurance
of
the
cockney
came
to
her
aid
i
do
see
why
there
should
be
such
a
fuss
about
nothing
she
said
i
do
know
his
people
i
saw
the
gentleman
pitched
out
of
a
cab
and
was
sorry
for
him
so
i
just
called
to
ask
how
he
was
she
angrily
tossed
her
head
and
stared
insolently
at
an
old
lady
who
came
to
inquire
if
there
were
any
letters
for
the
countess
of
skerry
and
ness
no
letters
your
ladyship
said
the
man
and
you
miss
must
either
send
a
personal
message
or
see
the
manager
the
young
woman
bounced
out
in
a
fury
and
brett
followed
her
silently
thanking
the
favouring
planets
which
had
sent
him
down
the
stairs
at
the
very
moment
when
the
girl
was
proffering
her
request
to
the
clerk
fortunately
the
weather
was
better
now
there
was
a
clear
sky
overhead
and
the
streets
looked
quite
cheerful
after
the
steady
downpour
myriad
lamps
being
reflected
in
glistening
zigzags
across
the
wet
pavement
the
girl
did
not
head
towards
the
busy
strand
but
walked
direct
to
charing
cross
station
on
the
district
railway
the
barrister
thought
she
intended
to
go
somewhere
by
train
he
quickened
his
pace
in
order
to
be
able
to
rapidly
obtain
a
ticket
and
thus
keep
up
with
her
herein
he
was
lucky
to
his
surprise
she
passed
out
of
the
station
on
the
embankment
side
he
followed
and
nowhere
could
he
see
her
then
he
remembered
the
steps
leading
to
the
footpath
along
the
hungerford
bridge
running
up
these
steps
he
soon
caught
sight
of
the
young
woman
who
was
walking
rapidly
towards
waterloo
a
man
of
the
artisan
class
stared
at
her
as
she
passed
and
said
something
to
her
she
turned
fiercely
do
you
want
a
swipe
on
the
jaw
she
demanded
no
he
did
not
what
had
he
done
he
would
like
to
know
you
mind
your
own
business
she
said
where
am
i
goin
indeed
it
got
to
do
with
you
the
episode
was
valuable
to
the
listening
barrister
it
classified
the
anxious
inquirer
after
hume
health
her
abashed
admirer
hung
back
and
the
girl
resumed
her
onward
progress
the
man
was
conscious
that
the
gentleman
behind
him
must
have
heard
what
passed
he
endeavoured
to
justify
himself
she
pretty
she
is
he
grinned
do
you
know
her
said
brett
i
know
her
by
sight
seen
her
in
the
york
now
an
then
she
can
evidently
take
care
of
herself
ra
ther
do
you
so
much
as
look
at
her
mister
or
off
goes
your
topper
into
the
river
she
in
a
bad
temper
brett
laughed
and
walked
ahead
on
reaching
the
surrey
side
the
girl
made
for
the
waterloo
road
there
she
mounted
on
top
of
a
the
barrister
went
inside
he
thought
of
the
man
with
black
snaky
eyes
who
took
all
the
way
from
the
elephant
to
whitehall
and
now
he
brett
took
a
to
the
elephant
the
reached
that
famous
centre
of
humanity
passing
thence
through
newington
butts
to
the
kennington
park
road
in
the
latter
thoroughfare
the
girl
skipped
down
from
the
roof
and
disdaining
the
conductor
offer
to
stop
swung
herself
lightly
to
the
ground
the
barrister
followed
and
soon
found
himself
tracking
her
along
a
curved
street
of
dingy
houses
into
one
of
these
she
vanished
it
chanced
to
be
opposite
a
and
as
he
walked
past
he
made
out
the
number
externally
it
was
exactly
like
its
neighbours
dull
soiled
pinched
old
curtains
worn
blinds
blistered
paint
he
knew
that
if
he
walked
inside
he
would
tread
on
a
strip
of
oilcloth
once
gay
in
red
and
yellow
squares
but
now
worn
to
a
dirty
grey
uniformity
in
the
hall
he
would
encounter
a
rickety
faced
by
an
ancient
print
entitled
idle
hours
and
depicting
two
ladies
reclining
on
rocks
attired
in
tremendous
skirts
tight
jackets
and
diminutive
straw
hats
perched
between
their
forehead
and
chignons
in
the
middle
distance
a
fat
urchin
all
hat
and
frills
staring
stupidly
at
the
ocean
in
the
front
he
would
encounter
chairs
frayed
carpet
and
more
early
victorian
prints
in
the
back
more
frayed
carpet
more
prints
and
possibly
a
bed
nothing
very
mysterious
or
about
middle
street
yet
the
barrister
was
loth
to
leave
the
place
the
scent
of
the
chase
was
in
his
nostrils
he
had
found
he
was
tempted
to
boldly
approach
and
frame
some
excuse
a
hunt
for
lodgings
an
inquiry
for
a
missing
friend
anything
to
gain
admittance
and
learn
something
however
meagre
in
result
of
the
occupants
he
reviewed
the
facts
calmly
to
attempt
at
such
an
hour
to
glean
information
from
the
young
person
who
had
just
admitted
herself
with
a
latchkey
was
to
court
failure
and
suspicion
he
must
bide
his
time
winter
was
an
adept
in
ferreting
out
facts
concerning
these
localities
and
their
denizens
to
winter
the
inquiry
must
be
left
he
stopped
at
the
further
end
of
the
street
lit
a
cigar
and
walked
back
he
had
again
passed
no
giving
a
casual
glance
to
the
second
floor
front
window
in
which
a
light
illumined
the
blind
when
he
became
aware
that
a
man
was
approaching
from
the
kennington
park
road
otherwise
the
street
was
empty
the
lamp
opposite
no
did
not
throw
its
beams
far
into
the
gloom
but
the
advancing
figure
instantly
enlisted
brett
attention
the
man
was
tall
and
strongly
built
he
moved
with
the
ease
of
an
athlete
he
walked
with
a
long
swinging
stride
yet
carried
himself
erect
he
was
attired
in
a
navy
blue
serge
suit
and
a
bowler
hat
the
two
were
rapidly
nearing
each
other
at
ten
yards
distance
brett
knew
that
the
other
man
was
he
whom
he
sought
the
murderer
of
sir
alan
the
human
ogre
whose
mission
on
earth
seemed
to
be
the
extinction
of
all
who
bore
that
fated
name
it
is
idle
to
deny
that
brett
was
startled
by
this
unexpected
rencontre
not
until
he
made
the
discovery
did
he
remember
that
he
was
carrying
the
stick
rescued
from
the
mud
of
northumberland
avenue
the
knowledge
gave
him
an
additional
thrill
though
he
could
be
cool
enough
in
exciting
circumstances
though
his
quiet
courage
had
more
than
once
saved
his
life
in
moments
of
extreme
peril
though
physically
he
was
more
than
able
to
hold
his
own
with
say
the
average
professional
boxer
he
fully
understood
that
the
individual
now
about
to
pass
within
a
stride
could
kill
him
with
ridiculous
ease
would
this
dangerous
personage
recognise
his
own
stick
that
was
the
question
if
he
did
brett
could
already
see
himself
describing
a
parabola
in
the
air
could
hear
his
skull
crashing
against
the
pavement
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
sit
with
the
coroner
jury
and
bring
in
a
verdict
of
accidental
death
in
no
sense
did
brett
exaggerate
the
risk
he
encountered
the
individual
who
could
stab
sir
alan
to
death
with
a
knife
like
a
toy
hurl
a
stalwart
sailor
into
the
middle
of
a
street
without
perceptible
effort
and
bring
down
a
horse
and
cab
at
the
precise
instant
and
in
the
exact
spot
determined
upon
after
a
second
thought
was
no
ordinary
opponent
their
eyes
met
truly
a
a
satanic
impersonation
of
a
fine
human
type
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
his
life
brett
regretted
that
he
did
not
carry
a
revolver
when
engaged
in
his
affairs
the
barrister
be
it
stated
wore
the
conventional
and
tall
hat
of
society
his
was
a
face
once
seen
not
easily
forgotten
the
outlines
classic
and
finely
chiselled
the
habitual
expression
thoughtful
preoccupied
the
prevalent
idea
conveyed
being
tenacious
strength
quite
an
unusual
person
in
middle
street
kennington
they
passed
brett
swung
the
stick
carelessly
in
his
left
hand
but
not
so
carelessly
that
on
the
least
sign
of
a
hostile
movement
he
would
be
unable
to
dash
it
viciously
at
his
possible
adversary
eyes
he
remembered
the
advice
of
an
old
cavalry
officer
always
give
the
point
between
the
eyes
they
come
head
first
and
you
reach
at
the
earliest
moment
nevertheless
he
experienced
a
quick
quiver
down
his
spine
when
the
other
man
deliberately
stopped
and
looked
after
him
he
did
not
turn
his
head
but
he
could
feel
that
vicious
glance
travelling
over
him
could
hear
the
unspoken
question
now
i
wonder
who
are
and
what
you
want
here
he
staggered
slightly
recovered
his
balance
and
went
on
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
suggestiveness
not
overdone
a
mere
wink
of
intoxication
as
it
were
it
sufficed
such
an
explanation
accounts
for
many
things
in
london
the
watcher
resumed
his
interrupted
progress
brett
crossed
the
street
and
deliberately
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
house
in
which
the
ground
floor
was
illuminated
someone
peeped
through
a
blind
the
door
opened
as
far
as
a
rattling
chain
would
permit
good
evening
said
brett
what
do
you
want
demanded
a
suspicious
woman
smith
horatio
smith
he
does
live
here
dear
me
is
this
middle
street
yes
all
the
same
there
no
smiths
here
the
door
slammed
but
the
barrister
had
attained
his
object
the
other
man
had
entered
no
chapter
xxv
where
did
margaret
go
in
the
kennington
park
road
he
hailed
hansom
and
drove
home
winter
awaited
him
for
smith
now
admitted
the
detective
without
demur
should
his
master
be
absent
the
barrister
walked
to
a
sideboard
produced
a
decanter
of
brandy
and
helped
himself
to
a
stiff
dose
ah
he
said
pleasantly
our
american
cousins
call
it
a
reviver
but
a
corpse
could
not
do
that
could
he
winter
i
know
a
few
corpses
that
would
like
to
try
but
what
is
up
sir
i
have
not
often
seen
you
in
need
of
stimulants
i
am
most
unfeignedly
glad
to
give
you
the
opportunity
winter
suppose
some
time
you
were
told
that
the
body
of
reginald
brett
and
a
amateur
investigator
of
crime
had
been
picked
up
shortly
after
midnight
in
the
kennington
district
whilst
the
medical
evidence
showed
that
death
was
caused
by
a
fractured
skull
the
result
of
a
fall
there
being
no
other
marks
of
violence
on
the
person
what
would
you
have
thought
it
all
depends
upon
the
additional
facts
that
came
to
light
i
will
tell
them
to
you
you
were
aware
that
i
had
quitted
the
hotel
because
you
called
there
yes
whom
did
you
see
david
he
said
that
you
were
angry
with
capella
for
no
earthly
reason
that
he
could
make
out
he
further
informed
me
that
she
had
followed
you
when
you
left
the
room
and
had
not
returned
being
presumably
in
her
own
apartment
anything
further
hume
asked
miss
layton
to
go
and
see
if
capella
had
retired
for
the
night
miss
layton
came
back
looking
rather
scared
with
the
information
that
capella
had
dressed
and
gone
out
after
a
little
further
talk
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
you
were
both
together
was
that
so
brett
had
commenced
his
with
the
intention
of
humorously
proving
to
winter
that
he
the
detective
would
suspect
the
wrong
person
of
committing
the
imagined
murder
now
he
straightened
himself
and
continued
in
deadly
earnest
when
did
you
leave
the
hotel
about
had
not
capella
returned
not
a
sign
of
her
miss
layton
was
alarmed
both
the
men
furious
robert
particularly
so
i
did
not
see
any
use
in
remaining
there
thought
in
fact
i
ought
to
obey
orders
and
await
you
here
so
here
i
am
the
barrister
scribbled
on
a
card
is
at
home
he
rang
for
smith
and
said
take
a
cab
to
hume
hotel
give
him
that
card
and
bring
me
the
answer
if
you
and
the
cabman
must
have
a
drink
together
kindly
defer
the
function
until
after
your
return
smith
took
such
jibes
in
good
part
he
knew
full
well
that
to
attempt
to
argue
with
his
master
would
produce
a
list
of
previous
convictions
then
brett
proceeded
to
amaze
winter
in
his
turn
giving
him
a
full
true
and
complete
history
of
events
since
his
parting
from
capella
in
the
corridor
he
had
barely
finished
the
recital
when
smith
returned
with
a
note
yes
she
came
in
at
and
has
since
retired
for
the
night
she
says
that
her
head
ached
that
she
wanted
to
be
alone
and
went
for
a
long
walk
seemed
rather
to
resent
our
anxiety
helen
and
i
will
be
glad
when
we
are
all
safely
away
from
london
the
barrister
pondered
over
this
communication
for
a
long
time
i
fear
he
said
at
last
that
i
came
away
from
middle
street
a
few
minutes
too
soon
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
in
an
abject
state
of
fear
next
time
i
meet
frazer
the
third
i
will
be
ready
for
him
is
he
really
so
like
the
others
that
he
might
be
mistaken
for
one
of
them
in
a
sense
yes
he
has
the
same
figure
general
conformation
and
features
but
in
other
respects
he
is
utterly
different
have
you
ever
seen
a
great
actor
in
the
role
of
mephistopheles
i
do
remember
my
favourite
villain
was
barry
sullivan
as
richard
iii
brett
laughed
hysterically
let
me
speak
more
plainly
you
have
no
doubt
a
vague
picture
in
your
mind
of
a
certain
gentleman
of
the
highest
descent
who
is
popularly
credited
with
the
possession
of
horns
hoofs
and
a
barbed
tail
i
heard
of
him
very
well
you
will
see
someone
very
like
him
minus
the
adornments
aforesaid
when
you
set
eyes
on
the
principal
occupant
of
middle
street
winter
slowly
assimilated
this
description
then
he
inquired
why
did
you
say
just
now
that
you
came
away
from
middle
street
a
few
minutes
too
soon
where
did
capella
go
when
she
left
the
hotel
if
she
went
to
visit
the
man
you
met
then
she
is
acting
in
collision
with
her
brother
murderer
and
she
knows
it
that
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
winter
it
is
a
harder
thing
to
credit
sir
but
one
can
not
reject
all
evidence
merely
because
it
happens
to
be
straightforward
and
not
hypothetical
winter
you
are
sneering
at
me
no
i
am
only
trying
to
make
you
admit
the
tendency
of
facts
discovered
by
yourself
there
is
a
period
in
all
criminal
investigation
when
deductive
reasoning
becomes
inductive
now
i
have
got
you
cried
brett
i
thought
i
recognised
the
source
of
your
philosophy
in
the
first
postulate
the
second
convinces
me
you
have
been
reading
murders
in
the
rue
morgue
the
book
is
in
my
pocket
admitted
winter
i
recommend
you
to
transfer
it
to
your
head
it
should
be
issued
departmentally
as
a
supplement
to
the
police
code
but
let
us
waste
no
more
time
we
have
much
to
accomplish
i
am
all
attention
in
the
first
place
capella
is
leaving
london
for
the
north
she
must
not
be
regarded
in
our
operations
the
woman
is
weighted
with
a
secret
i
am
sorry
for
her
i
prefer
to
allow
events
as
supplied
by
others
to
unravel
the
skein
secondly
jiro
and
his
wife
and
all
who
visit
them
or
whom
they
visit
must
be
watched
incessantly
get
all
the
force
required
for
this
operation
in
its
fullest
sense
you
with
one
trusted
associate
must
keep
a
close
eye
on
no
middle
street
on
no
account
obtrude
yourself
personally
into
affairs
there
rather
miss
twenty
opportunities
than
scare
that
man
by
one
false
move
do
you
understand
me
thoroughly
i
am
to
see
and
not
be
seen
if
i
can
not
do
the
one
without
the
other
i
must
do
neither
exactly
what
a
holiday
you
are
having
you
will
return
to
the
yard
with
an
expanded
brain
when
you
buy
a
new
hat
you
will
be
astounded
and
gratified
but
beware
of
the
fate
of
the
frog
in
the
fable
he
inflated
himself
until
he
emulated
the
size
of
the
bull
and
then
oh
then
he
burst
the
detective
changed
the
conversation
abruptly
what
do
you
propose
doing
mr
brett
i
purpose
reading
a
chapter
in
stowmarket
mystery
written
by
your
friend
mr
holden
they
heard
a
loud
on
the
outer
door
probably
continued
brett
this
is
its
title
smith
entered
with
a
telegram
it
was
in
the
typed
capitals
usually
associated
with
continental
messages
it
read
johnson
leaves
naples
with
others
i
travel
same
holden
the
barrister
surveyed
the
simple
words
with
an
intensity
that
indicated
his
desire
to
wrest
from
their
context
its
hidden
significance
winter
more
subject
to
the
influences
of
the
hour
puffed
his
cigar
furiously
you
arrange
your
words
to
suit
the
next
act
for
all
the
world
like
an
adelphi
play
he
growled
i
see
that
holden
has
the
same
gift
what
does
he
mean
by
who
is
capella
bringing
with
him
witnesses
volunteered
winter
just
so
but
witnesses
in
what
cause
how
the
how
can
i
tell
by
applying
your
borrowed
logic
try
the
deductive
reasoning
you
flung
at
me
a
while
ago
i
do
quite
know
what
means
was
the
sulky
admission
that
is
the
first
step
towards
wisdom
you
admit
ignorance
deduction
in
this
sense
is
the
process
of
deriving
consequences
from
admitted
facts
now
mark
you
capella
wishes
to
be
rid
of
his
wife
by
death
or
legal
separation
he
thinks
he
wants
to
marry
miss
layton
he
is
convinced
that
something
within
his
power
if
done
effectively
will
bring
about
both
events
he
can
shunt
capella
and
so
disgust
miss
layton
with
the
that
she
will
turn
to
the
next
ardent
and
sympathetic
wooer
that
presents
himself
he
knew
the
points
of
his
case
and
went
to
naples
to
procure
proofs
he
has
obtained
them
they
are
chiefly
living
persons
he
is
bringing
them
to
england
and
their
testimony
will
convict
capella
of
some
either
voluntary
or
involuntary
holden
knows
what
capella
has
accomplished
and
thinks
it
is
unnecessary
to
remain
longer
in
naples
he
is
right
i
tell
you
winter
i
like
holden
and
i
tell
you
brett
that
if
i
swallowed
the
whole
of
stories
i
could
make
out
holden
telegram
in
that
fashion
so
i
must
stick
to
my
own
methods
and
i
put
away
a
few
wrong
in
my
time
when
shall
i
see
you
next
brett
took
out
his
watch
at
seven
the
day
after
he
said
coolly
until
then
my
address
is
metropole
brighton
chapter
xxvi
ooma
he
kept
his
word
early
next
morning
after
despatching
a
message
to
david
hume
and
receiving
an
answer
an
acknowledgment
of
his
address
in
case
of
need
he
took
train
to
and
for
hours
flung
mysteries
and
intrigues
to
the
winds
he
came
back
prepared
for
the
approaching
climax
in
such
matters
he
was
a
human
barometer
the
affairs
of
the
family
in
whose
interests
he
had
become
so
suddenly
involved
were
rapidly
reaching
an
acute
stage
something
must
happen
soon
and
that
something
would
probably
have
tremendous
and
consequences
capella
and
his
companions
known
and
unknown
would
reach
london
at
it
pleased
brett
to
time
his
homeward
journey
so
that
he
would
speed
in
the
same
direction
but
arrive
before
them
in
these
trivial
matters
he
owned
to
a
boyish
enthusiasm
it
stimulated
him
to
beat
the
other
man
even
if
he
only
called
upon
the
london
brighton
and
south
coast
line
to
conquer
a
weak
opponent
like
the
at
his
flat
were
several
letters
and
telegrams
capella
wrote
i
have
seriously
considered
your
last
words
to
me
it
is
hard
for
a
woman
the
victim
of
circumstances
and
deprived
of
her
husband
support
at
a
most
trying
and
critical
period
to
know
how
to
act
for
the
best
you
said
you
wished
your
hands
to
be
left
unfettered
well
be
it
so
you
will
encounter
no
hindrance
from
me
i
pray
for
your
success
and
can
only
hope
that
in
bringing
happiness
to
others
you
will
secure
peace
for
me
poor
woman
he
murmured
she
still
trusts
to
chance
to
save
her
whom
does
she
dread
not
her
husband
each
day
that
passes
she
must
despise
him
the
more
does
she
know
that
robert
loves
her
is
she
afraid
that
he
will
despise
her
really
a
collision
in
which
capella
was
the
only
victim
would
be
a
perfect
godsend
david
telegraphed
the
safe
arrival
of
the
party
at
a
whitby
hotel
we
have
seen
nothing
more
of
our
northumberland
avenue
acquaintance
he
added
holden
too
cabled
from
paris
announcing
progress
the
remainder
of
the
correspondence
referred
to
other
matters
and
social
engagements
all
which
latter
fixtures
the
barrister
had
summarily
broken
winter
was
announced
his
face
heralded
important
tidings
well
how
goes
the
ratiocinative
process
was
brett
greeting
i
do
know
him
said
the
detective
but
i
do
happen
to
know
most
of
the
private
inquiry
agents
in
london
and
one
of
is
going
strong
in
middle
street
he
watching
ooma
for
all
he
worth
mr
i
not
joking
brett
that
is
the
name
of
the
mysterious
gent
in
no
ooma
no
initials
anyhow
that
is
the
name
he
gives
to
the
landlady
and
her
daughter
the
girl
you
followed
from
the
hotel
tells
all
her
friends
that
when
he
gets
his
rights
he
will
marry
her
and
make
her
a
princess
ooma
a
princess
repeated
brett
such
is
the
yarn
in
kennington
circles
i
obeyed
orders
absolutely
i
and
my
mate
took
turn
about
in
the
lodgings
we
hired
where
we
are
supposed
to
be
inventors
my
pal
has
a
mechanical
twist
he
puts
together
a
small
electric
machine
during
his
spell
and
i
take
it
to
pieces
in
mine
yesterday
my
landlady
was
in
the
room
and
ooma
looked
out
of
the
opposite
window
then
she
told
me
the
whole
story
go
on
do
ooma
is
evidently
puzzled
to
learn
what
has
become
of
the
and
mrs
capella
why
do
you
bring
in
her
name
because
it
leads
to
the
second
part
of
my
story
someone
capella
or
his
solicitors
i
expect
instructed
matchem
and
smith
private
detectives
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
lady
their
man
is
an
constable
a
former
subordinate
of
mine
who
was
fined
for
taking
a
drink
when
he
ought
not
to
of
course
i
knew
him
and
he
knew
me
so
i
much
trouble
in
getting
it
out
of
him
the
speaker
paused
with
due
dramatic
effect
got
what
out
of
him
cried
brett
impatiently
and
do
puff
your
cheeks
in
that
way
remember
the
terrible
fate
of
the
frog
who
would
be
a
bull
there
neither
frogs
nor
bulls
in
this
business
retorted
winter
calm
in
the
consciousness
of
his
coming
revelation
capella
did
go
to
middle
street
that
night
she
drove
there
in
a
hansom
had
a
long
talk
with
ooma
and
nearly
drove
miss
dew
crazy
with
jealousy
we
guessed
that
already
miss
dew
is
the
prospective
princess
i
presume
yes
she
has
been
twice
to
the
hotel
since
trying
to
find
out
where
the
party
went
to
next
ooma
has
plenty
of
money
and
now
for
my
prize
packet
he
is
a
jap
impossible
this
time
you
are
wrong
brett
you
have
only
seen
him
once
you
were
full
of
his
remarkable
likeness
to
the
it
is
startling
i
admit
and
at
no
man
living
could
avoid
the
mistake
but
i
tell
you
he
is
a
jap
he
met
jiro
yesterday
and
they
walked
in
kensington
palace
gardens
they
talked
japanese
all
the
time
my
mate
heard
them
he
distinctly
caught
the
word
more
than
once
he
managed
to
shadow
them
very
neatly
by
hiring
a
and
telling
the
attendant
to
come
near
to
the
pair
every
time
there
was
a
chance
more
than
that
when
you
know
it
you
can
see
the
japanese
eyes
skin
and
mouth
it
is
the
grafting
of
the
jap
on
the
european
model
that
gives
him
the
likeness
to
well
to
the
party
you
mentioned
the
other
day
the
devil
exclaimed
brett
that
him
it
was
useless
to
explain
that
the
exclamation
was
one
of
amazement
the
barrister
began
to
roam
about
the
apartment
frowning
with
the
intensity
of
his
thoughts
once
he
confronted
winter
are
you
sure
of
this
he
demanded
so
sure
that
were
it
not
for
your
positive
instructions
ooma
would
now
be
in
holloway
awaiting
his
trial
on
a
charge
of
murder
look
at
the
facts
jack
can
identify
him
he
knew
how
to
use
the
he
knew
the
japanese
tricks
of
wrestling
which
enabled
him
to
make
those
two
clever
attacks
on
the
two
cousins
he
has
some
power
over
capella
which
brings
her
to
him
at
eleven
at
night
in
a
distant
quarter
of
london
he
made
jiro
write
the
typed
letter
in
my
possession
he
sent
jiro
to
ipswich
to
attend
david
second
trial
when
the
first
missed
fire
i
can
string
ooma
on
that
little
lot
winter
said
brett
sternly
you
make
me
tired
have
all
these
stunning
items
of
intelligence
invaded
your
intellect
only
since
you
went
to
middle
street
no
not
exactly
brett
i
must
admit
that
each
one
of
them
is
your
discovery
except
the
fact
that
he
is
a
jap
always
excepting
that
but
yesterday
i
strung
them
together
so
to
speak
ending
your
task
by
stringing
ooma
in
imagination
i
allow
you
full
credit
for
your
sensational
development
always
excepting
this
that
i
sent
you
to
middle
street
why
did
he
kill
sir
alan
how
does
his
japanese
nationality
elucidate
an
utterly
useless
and
purposeless
murder
i
do
know
mr
brett
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
you
will
learn
holden
is
nearly
due
the
barrister
resumed
his
stalk
round
the
room
in
another
minute
he
stopped
to
glance
at
his
watch
seven
he
murmured
just
time
to
get
a
message
through
to
whitby
and
perhaps
a
reply
he
wrote
a
telegram
to
hume
where
is
fergusson
i
want
to
see
him
what
has
fergusson
got
to
do
with
the
business
asked
the
detective
probably
nothing
but
he
is
the
oldest
available
repository
of
the
family
secrets
his
master
has
told
him
to
be
explicit
with
me
by
questioning
him
i
may
solve
the
riddle
presented
by
ooma
does
the
name
suggest
nothing
to
you
winter
it
has
a
japanese
ring
about
it
nothing
scotch
is
it
like
hume
for
instance
by
jove
i
never
thought
of
that
well
there
i
give
in
ooma
dash
my
buttons
that
beats
the
barrister
paid
no
heed
to
winter
fall
from
he
pondered
deeply
on
the
queer
twist
given
to
events
by
the
statement
at
last
he
took
a
volume
from
his
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
japanese
names
he
said
i
described
to
you
for
instance
what
strange
mutations
your
surname
would
undergo
were
you
born
in
the
far
east
yes
i
would
be
called
spring
summer
etc
according
to
my
growth
then
listen
to
this
and
he
read
the
following
extract
from
that
excellent
work
the
mikado
empire
by
griffis
it
has
until
recently
in
japan
been
the
custom
for
every
samurai
to
be
named
differently
in
babyhood
boyhood
manhood
or
promotion
change
of
life
or
residence
in
commemoration
of
certain
events
or
on
account
of
a
vow
or
from
mere
whim
what
a
place
for
aliases
interpolated
the
professional
at
the
birth
of
a
famous
warrior
went
on
brett
his
mother
having
dreamed
that
she
conceived
by
the
sun
called
him
hiyoshi
maro
good
sun
others
dubbed
him
ko
chiku
small
boy
and
afterward
saru
watsu
he
closed
the
volume
this
gentleman
has
twenty
other
names
he
added
but
the
foregoing
list
will
suffice
does
it
strike
you
as
odd
that
the
man
who
struck
down
the
fifth
baronet
on
the
spot
so
fatal
to
his
four
predecessors
should
bring
from
a
country
given
to
such
a
cognomen
that
irresistibly
recalls
the
original
enemy
of
the
family
david
hume
it
is
odd
asserted
winter
someone
rang
and
was
admitted
holden
announced
smith
chapter
xxvii
holden
story
the
entered
his
sallow
face
was
browned
after
his
long
journeys
and
exposure
to
the
italian
sun
in
midsummer
he
was
soiled
and
excuse
my
appearance
he
said
i
have
had
no
time
for
even
a
wash
since
this
morning
on
board
the
boat
i
thought
it
best
to
keep
a
constant
watch
on
capella
and
his
companions
who
are
they
demanded
brett
holden
looked
at
the
barrister
with
an
injured
air
i
am
a
man
of
few
words
sir
he
said
and
if
you
do
not
mind
i
will
tell
my
story
in
my
own
way
winter
was
secretly
delighted
to
hear
the
old
as
they
called
him
in
the
yard
take
a
rise
out
of
brett
in
this
manner
perhaps
exclaimed
the
barrister
your
few
words
will
come
more
easily
if
you
wet
your
whistle
well
i
must
admit
that
italian
wine
is
not
equal
to
scotch
or
is
it
irish
irish
sir
if
you
please
holden
utterance
having
been
cleared
of
cinders
he
made
a
fresh
start
as
i
was
saying
gentlemen
i
kept
an
observant
eye
on
capella
and
his
companions
and
at
the
same
time
occupied
myself
in
the
fashioning
of
certain
little
models
with
which
to
illustrate
my
subsequent
remarks
he
produced
a
map
of
naples
which
he
carefully
smoothed
out
on
the
table
pressing
the
creases
with
his
fingers
until
brett
itched
to
tweak
his
long
nose
the
man
was
evidently
a
belfast
irishman
and
the
barrister
forced
himself
to
find
amusement
in
speculating
how
such
an
individual
came
to
speak
italian
fluently
speculation
on
this
abstruse
problem
however
yielded
to
keen
interest
in
holden
proceedings
on
the
face
of
the
map
he
located
a
number
of
small
wooden
carvings
which
were
really
very
ingenious
they
represented
churches
an
hotel
a
mansion
three
ordinary
houses
a
rambling
building
like
a
public
institution
and
a
nondescript
structure
difficult
to
classify
i
find
said
holden
when
the
was
quite
to
his
liking
that
a
good
map
and
a
few
realistic
models
of
the
principal
buildings
dealt
with
in
my
discourse
give
a
lucidity
and
a
coherence
otherwise
foreign
to
the
narrative
even
winter
became
restive
under
this
style
of
address
brett
caught
his
eye
and
moved
by
common
impulse
they
lessened
the
in
a
decanter
of
antiquary
allow
me
to
remark
interpolated
brett
that
your
telegrams
were
admirably
terse
and
to
the
point
thank
you
sir
many
eminent
judges
have
complimented
me
on
my
manner
of
giving
evidence
and
now
to
business
i
arrived
at
the
railway
station
here
touching
the
building
and
took
a
room
in
the
villa
nuova
here
he
laid
a
finger
on
the
mansion
which
as
you
see
is
quite
close
to
the
hotel
de
londres
here
a
flourish
over
the
hotel
at
which
as
i
expected
capella
took
up
his
abode
according
to
your
instructions
i
obtained
a
competent
assistant
a
native
of
naples
and
we
both
awaited
capella
arrival
he
reached
naples
at
the
day
following
my
advent
at
night
and
after
breakfast
drove
straight
to
the
reclusorio
or
asylum
for
the
poor
situated
here
he
indicated
the
institution
close
to
the
botanical
gardens
capella
arranged
with
the
authorities
to
withdraw
from
the
poorhouse
an
elderly
woman
named
maria
bresciano
it
subsequently
transpired
that
she
was
a
nurse
employed
by
a
certain
english
gentleman
named
fraser
beechcroft
who
became
entangled
with
a
beautiful
italian
girl
named
margarita
di
orvieto
some
years
ago
holden
paid
not
the
remotest
attention
to
the
looks
of
amazement
exchanged
between
brett
and
winter
he
merely
paused
to
take
breath
and
peer
benignantly
at
the
map
following
lines
thereon
with
the
index
finger
of
his
right
hand
it
appears
further
he
resumed
that
the
englishman
and
the
signorina
di
orvieto
could
not
marry
on
account
of
some
foolish
religious
scruples
held
by
the
young
lady
but
they
entertained
a
very
violent
passion
for
each
other
met
clandestinely
and
a
female
child
was
born
whose
baptism
is
registered
under
the
name
of
margarita
di
orvieto
in
the
church
of
the
village
of
la
scutillo
here
he
tapped
a
tiny
spired
edifice
on
the
edge
of
the
map
the
two
were
living
there
in
great
secrecy
as
they
were
in
fear
of
their
lives
not
alone
from
the
young
lady
relatives
but
from
her
discarded
lover
the
marchese
di
capella
father
of
the
present
giovanni
capella
who
has
dropped
his
title
in
england
the
old
woman
maria
bresciano
attended
the
signorina
and
her
child
but
unfortunately
the
mother
died
and
her
death
is
registered
both
by
the
civil
authorities
in
the
minadoi
section
here
lifting
a
small
house
bodily
off
the
map
and
by
the
ecclesiastical
here
he
touched
another
spire
the
affair
created
some
stir
in
the
naples
of
that
day
but
suffering
the
calm
daring
with
which
after
the
girl
death
he
defied
those
who
had
vowed
vengeance
on
him
and
the
generally
passionate
nature
of
the
attachment
between
the
two
created
much
public
sympathy
for
him
among
others
who
were
attracted
to
him
were
a
and
somers
and
their
daughter
then
resident
in
naples
oddly
enough
beechcroft
did
not
content
himself
with
securing
efficient
care
for
his
child
but
brought
the
infant
to
the
hotel
de
londres
you
note
the
coincidence
where
it
was
nurtured
under
his
personal
supervision

drew
a
long
breath
so
this
was
margaret
secret
and
vengeance
he
was
aroused
as
from
a
dream
by
holden
steady
voice
beechcroft
always
held
that
the
signorina
di
orvieto
was
his
true
wife
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
for
their
marriage
was
only
prevented
by
a
most
and
unnatural
threat
of
incurring
her
father
dying
curse
it
she
dared
to
wed
a
protestant
eighteen
months
after
her
death
he
married
miss
somers
at
the
british
consulate
and
revealed
his
real
name
and
rank
sir
alan
baronet
of
beechcroft
near
stowmarket
england
his
lady
adopted
the
infant
girl
as
her
own
and
local
gossip
had
it
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
marriage
contract
whilst
the
ceremony
took
place
at
an
early
date
to
give
colour
to
the
kindly
pretence
the
pair
lived
in
a
distant
suburb
at
donzelle
here
another
church
fixed
the
spot
and
in
twelve
months
a
boy
was
born
birth
registered
locally
and
in
the
british
consulate
after
four
more
years
residence
in
naples
sir
alan
and
lady
left
italy
with
their
two
children
capella
found
two
of
their
old
servants
giuseppe
conti
and
lola
rintesano
living
in
these
small
houses
here
and
here
the
remaining
houses
were
lifted
into
prominence
capella
married
miss
margaret
in
naples
last
january
the
marriage
being
properly
registered
his
estates
are
situated
in
the
south
of
italy
and
his
father
retired
thither
permanently
during
the
scandal
that
took
place
years
ago
capella
has
brought
with
him
the
persons
named
as
the
nurse
and
servants
together
with
certified
copies
of
all
the
documents
cited
i
also
have
certified
copies
of
those
documents
i
now
produce
them
together
with
a
detailed
statement
of
my
expenses
capella
is
residing
in
a
neighbouring
hotel
the
methodical
laid
some
neatly
docketed
folios
on
the
table
near
the
map
and
sat
down
for
the
first
time
since
entering
the
room
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
not
uttered
an
unnecessary
word
other
men
describing
similar
complexities
would
have
given
particulars
of
their
adventures
how
this
thing
had
been
done
and
that
person
wheedled
into
confidences
holden
rose
superior
to
these
considerations
his
mission
was
and
he
had
certainly
fulfilled
it
to
the
letter
if
ever
a
grateful
country
makes
me
a
judge
holden
said
brett
i
will
add
another
to
the
encomiums
you
have
received
from
the
bench
indeed
before
this
affair
ends
that
pleasant
task
may
be
performed
by
an
existing
judge
for
i
do
not
see
now
how
we
are
going
to
keep
out
of
the
do
you
winter
looks
like
a
murder
case
plus
a
divorce
commented
the
detective
you
are
leaving
out
of
count
the
biggest
sensation
namely
the
title
to
the
beechcroft
estates
under
her
father
will
if
it
is
very
cleverly
drawn
capella
may
receive
per
annum
she
has
not
the
remotest
claim
to
beechcroft
and
its
revenues
or
to
her
brother
intestate
estate
winter
whistled
my
eye
he
exclaimed
what
is
capella
going
to
get
out
of
it
revenge
his
is
a
legacy
of
hate
like
most
other
benefactions
in
the
family
the
next
move
rests
with
him
i
wonder
what
it
will
be
chapter
xxviii
and
jiro
chance
at
times
tangles
the
threads
on
which
human
lives
depend
and
creates
such
a
net
of
knots
and
meshes
that
intelligent
foresight
is
rendered
powerless
and
plans
that
ought
to
succeed
are
doomed
to
utter
failure
it
was
so
during
the
three
days
succeeding
capella
return
from
italy
reviewing
events
in
the
lights
of
accomplished
facts
brett
subsequently
saw
many
opportunities
where
his
intervention
would
have
altered
the
fortunes
of
the
men
and
women
in
whom
he
had
become
so
interested
although
he
endeavoured
to
keep
control
of
circumstances
it
was
impossible
to
predict
with
certainty
the
manner
in
which
the
fifth
act
of
this
tragedy
in
real
life
would
unfold
itself
would
he
have
ordered
things
differently
had
he
possessed
the
power
he
never
knew
it
was
a
question
he
refused
to
discuss
with
winter
long
after
everybody
was
comfortably
married
or
buried
as
the
case
might
be
to
divide
labour
and
responsibility
he
apportioned
ooma
and
his
surroundings
to
winter
capella
to
holden
the
strict
supervision
maintained
over
the
jiro
family
was
relaxed
brett
proposed
dealing
with
them
summarily
and
in
person
holden
had
barely
concluded
his
remarkable
narrative
when
hume
reply
came
from
whitby
giving
the
address
of
the
hotel
where
fergusson
resided
brett
went
there
at
once
and
found
the
old
butler
on
the
point
of
retiring
for
the
night
fergusson
was
at
first
disinclined
to
commit
himself
to
definite
statements
with
characteristic
scottish
caution
he
would
neither
say
yes
nor
no
until
the
barrister
reminded
him
that
he
was
not
acting
in
his
young
master
interests
by
being
so
reticent
weel
sir
i
an
auld
man
and
mebbe
a
bit
haverin
in
my
judgment
just
ask
me
what
ye
wull
an
i
dae
my
best
to
answer
ye
was
the
ultimate
concession
you
remember
the
day
of
the
murder
shall
i
ever
forget
it
before
david
arrived
at
beechcroft
from
london
had
any
other
visitors
seen
sir
alan
this
was
a
poser
no
form
of
ambiguity
known
to
fergusson
would
serve
to
extricate
him
from
a
direct
reply
ay
brett
came
his
reply
at
last
one
i
can
swear
to
that
was
robert
who
met
him
in
the
park
and
walked
with
him
there
about
three
to
four
in
the
afternoon
were
there
others
whom
you
can
not
swear
to
the
butler
darted
a
quick
glance
at
the
other
ye
ken
sir
he
said
that
the
are
mixed
up
wi
an
auld
scoatch
hoose
yes
weel
sir
there
things
that
happen
in
this
world
which
no
man
can
explain
five
are
dead
and
five
had
to
die
by
violent
means
who
arranged
that
neither
you
nor
i
can
tell
that
right
sir
i
know
that
david
or
robert
never
lifted
a
hand
against
their
cousin
yet
unless
the
lord
blinded
my
auld
een
i
saw
ane
or
ither
in
the
avenue
when
i
tried
to
lift
sir
alan
frae
the
groond
you
said
nothing
of
this
at
the
time
would
ye
hae
me
speak
o
wraiths
to
a
suffolk
jury
brett
i
saw
no
mortal
man
was
a
ghaist
for
sure
an
if
i
had
gone
into
the
box
to
talk
of
such
things
they
wad
hae
discredited
my
evidence
about
david
i
might
hae
hanged
him
instead
o
savin
him
suppose
i
tell
you
that
the
man
you
saw
was
no
ghost
but
real
flesh
and
blood
a
japanese
descendant
of
the
david
hume
who
fought
and
killed
the
first
sir
alan
in
what
would
you
say
i
would
say
sir
that
it
had
to
be
were
it
ever
so
strange
have
you
ever
in
gossip
about
family
records
heard
anything
of
the
fate
of
the
david
hume
i
have
just
mentioned
only
this
sir
my
people
have
lived
on
the
highland
estate
longer
than
any
of
them
a
my
father
remembered
his
grandfather
that
a
man
who
was
in
india
wi
clive
met
hume
in
calcutta
there
was
fightin
agin
the
french
an
hume
would
neither
strike
a
blow
for
king
george
nor
draw
a
sword
for
the
french
so
he
sailed
away
to
the
east
in
a
dutch
ship
and
he
was
never
heard
of
afterwards
this
was
a
most
important
confirmation
of
the
theory
evolved
by
the
barrister
for
the
rest
fergusson
reminiscences
were
useless
next
morning
brett
went
to
somerset
house
to
consult
the
will
in
which
margaret
father
left
her
a
year
her
brother
died
intestate
as
he
expected
the
document
was
phrased
adroitly
it
read
i
give
and
bequeath
to
margaret
who
has
elected
to
desert
the
home
provided
for
her
the
sum
of
etc
the
fact
that
she
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
an
illegitimate
child
could
not
invalidate
this
bequest
for
the
rest
he
imagined
that
when
her
brother
died
so
unexpectedly
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
inquiring
into
the
fraud
perpetrated
by
lady
and
her
husband
margaret
was
unquestionably
accepted
as
the
heiress
to
her
property
the
estate
being
unentailed
then
he
drove
to
john
mansions
kensington
where
and
jiro
were
at
home
they
received
him
in
the
tiny
and
the
lady
manner
betokened
some
degree
of
nervousness
which
she
vainly
endeavoured
to
conceal
by
a
pretence
of
bland
curiosity
as
to
the
object
of
the
barrister
visit
not
so
numagawa
whose
sharp
ferret
eyes
snapped
with
anxiety
brett
left
them
under
no
doubt
from
the
commencement
he
addressed
his
remarks
wholly
to
the
japanese
you
have
an
acquaintance
perhaps
i
should
say
a
confederate
residing
at
no
middle
street
kennington
he
began
i
do
not
understand
broke
in
jiro
whose
sallow
face
crinkled
like
a
withered
apple
in
the
effort
to
display
oh
yes
you
do
the
man
name
is
ooma
he
is
a
tall
native
of
japan
he
sent
you
to
ipswich
to
watch
the
trial
of
david
for
the
murder
of
his
cousin
he
got
you
to
write
the
to
scotland
yard
on
the
which
you
disposed
of
the
day
after
my
visit
here
you
recognised
the
motto
of
his
house
in
the
design
which
i
showed
you
and
which
was
borne
on
the
blade
of
the
for
some
reason
which
i
can
not
fathom
unless
you
are
his
accomplice
you
made
your
wife
dress
in
male
attire
and
go
to
warn
him
that
some
person
was
on
his
track
you
see
i
know
everything
as
each
sentence
of
this
indictment
proceeded
it
was
pitiable
to
watch
the
faces
of
the
couple
jiro
became
a
grotesque
fit
to
adorn
the
ugliest
of
satsuma
plaques
jiro
visibly
swelled
with
agitation
brett
felt
that
she
was
too
full
and
would
overflow
with
tears
in
an
instant
this
is
vely
bad
gasped
jiro
oh
nummie
dear
have
we
been
doing
wrong
moaned
his
spouse
the
barrister
determined
to
frighten
them
thoroughly
it
is
a
grave
question
with
the
authorities
whether
they
should
not
arrest
you
instantly
he
said
on
what
charge
cried
jiro
on
a
charge
of
complicity
after
the
act
in
relation
to
the
murder
of
sir
alan
your
accomplice
ooma
is
the
murderer
what
shrieked
jiro
flouncing
on
to
her
knees
and
breaking
forth
into
piteous
sobs
oh
my
precious
infant
oh
my
darling
nummie
will
they
part
us
from
our
babe
the
door
opened
and
a
frowsy
head
appeared
did
you
call
mum
inquired
the
small
get
out
shouted
brett
and
the
door
slammed
blett
whimpered
the
japanese
i
did
not
do
this
thing
i
am
innocent
i
knew
nothing
about
it
until
until
you
verified
the
motto
on
the
blade
by
consulting
the
suai
shi
in
the
british
museum
this
shot
floored
jiro
metaphorically
and
his
wife
literally
for
she
sank
into
a
heap
he
knows
everything
nummie
she
cried
evelything
repeated
her
husband
then
tell
him
the
rest
yet
she
was
born
in
suffolk
brett
scowled
terribly
as
a
subterfuge
for
laughter
tell
me
he
said
why
you
helped
this
amazing
scoundrel
i
did
not
help
squeaked
jiro
his
voice
becoming
shrill
with
excitement
and
fear
he
was
my
fliend
he
is
a
samurai
of
japan
we
met
in
okasaki
and
again
in
london
i
came
to
england
long
after
the
clime
you
talk
of
he
told
me
these
flazel
people
were
bad
people
who
had
lobbed
his
father
in
the
old
days
he
wanted
them
to
be
all
hanged
then
he
would
get
money
he
said
they
might
watch
him
and
get
him
sent
back
to
japan
where
he
belongs
to
a
political
palty
who
are
always
beheaded
when
they
are
caught
so
when
you
come
i
think
he
wants
to
find
ooma
i
lite
ooma
a
letter
and
he
lite
me
to
send
jilo
dlessed
in
man
clothes
to
tell
him
evelything
i
did
that
to
save
my
fliend
have
you
ooma
letter
yes
hele
it
is
he
took
a
document
from
a
drawer
and
brett
saw
at
a
glance
that
statement
was
correct
you
appear
to
have
acted
as
his
tool
throughout
was
his
scornful
comment
but
brett
sobbed
the
stout
lady
i
ought
to
say
that
when
i
when
i
put
on
those
things
and
met
ooma
i
disobeyed
my
husband
in
one
matter
i
liked
you
and
was
afraid
of
ooma
so
instead
of
describing
you
to
him
i
described
from
what
my
husband
told
me
of
his
appearance
in
the
dock
he
was
the
first
man
i
could
think
of
and
it
seemed
to
be
best
as
the
quarrel
was
between
them
only
i
gave
him
a
beard
and
moustache
so
as
to
puzzle
him
more
did
i
nummie
i
told
you
when
i
came
home
so
jiro
unconscious
device
had
undoubtedly
saved
brett
from
a
murderous
attack
and
ooma
had
probably
seen
him
leave
the
northumberland
avenue
hotel
more
than
once
whilst
waiting
to
waylay
david
hume
hence
too
the
partial
recognition
by
ooma
when
they
met
by
night
in
middle
street
the
barrister
could
not
help
being
milder
in
tone
as
he
said
i
believe
you
are
both
telling
the
truth
but
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
you
must
never
again
communicate
with
ooma
in
any
way
avoid
him
as
you
would
shun
the
plague
for
within
three
or
four
days
he
will
be
in
gaol
and
you
will
be
called
upon
to
give
evidence
against
him
chapter
xxix
margaret
secret
at
his
chambers
brett
found
holden
awaiting
him
with
the
tidings
that
capella
had
gone
to
whitby
the
italian
agents
matchem
smith
had
evidently
ferreted
out
margaret
whereabouts
her
husband
full
of
vengeful
thoughts
and
base
schemings
hastened
after
her
rejoicing
in
the
knowledge
that
her
cousins
and
miss
layton
would
also
be
present
as
i
knew
exactly
where
he
was
going
and
assumed
his
object
to
be
a
domestic
quarrel
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
accompany
him
until
i
had
first
consulted
you
sir
said
the
imperturbable
holden
you
acted
quite
rightly
wait
until
the
little
beast
returns
to
london
exclaimed
the
barrister
with
some
degree
of
warmth
capella
conduct
reminded
him
of
a
spiteful
child
which
deserved
a
sound
spanking
he
telegraphed
to
hume
to
inform
him
of
the
fiery
visitor
who
might
be
expected
at
the
hotel
that
evening
oddly
enough
helen
david
and
the
rev
layton
tempted
by
a
marine
excursion
to
scarborough
and
back
left
whitby
harbour
on
a
local
steamer
at
and
were
timed
to
return
about
margaret
was
not
a
good
sailor
so
robert
remained
with
her
the
two
going
for
a
protracted
stroll
along
the
cliffs
during
their
walk
the
golden
influences
of
the
hour
unlocked
heart
she
was
overwhelmed
with
the
consciousness
of
the
wretched
mistakes
of
her
life
she
could
not
help
contrasting
the
manly
gallant
sailor
by
her
side
with
the
miserable
foreigner
whom
she
had
espoused
under
the
influence
of
a
genuine
but
too
violent
passion
the
knowledge
that
robert
might
under
happier
conditions
have
been
her
husband
was
crushing
and
terrible
there
came
to
her
some
resolve
to
show
her
cousin
how
unworthy
she
was
of
his
affections
stopping
defiantly
at
a
moment
when
he
casually
called
her
attention
to
a
lovely
glimpse
of
sea
framed
in
a
deep
gorge
she
said
to
him
robert
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
brett
the
last
time
i
saw
him
in
london
but
he
would
not
permit
it
you
are
my
cousin
and
ought
to
know
my
dear
girl
he
cried
why
this
solemnity
you
give
me
shivers
when
you
speak
in
that
way
pray
listen
to
me
robert
this
is
no
matter
for
jesting
i
am
your
cousin
but
only
in
a
sense
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
i
am
a
nameless
outcast
my
mother
was
not
alan
mother
i
was
born
before
my
father
married
the
lady
who
treated
me
as
her
daughter
until
her
death
my
mother
was
an
italian
who
died
at
my
birth
and
whom
my
father
never
married
frazer
looked
at
the
beautiful
woman
who
addressed
these
astonishing
words
to
him
and
amazement
incredulity
a
spasm
almost
of
fear
held
him
dumb
it
is
too
true
robert
i
did
not
know
these
things
until
a
few
short
months
ago
some
one
i
believe
told
my
husband
the
truth
soon
after
our
marriage
and
it
was
this
discovery
that
so
changed
his
feelings
towards
me
at
first
i
was
utterly
unable
to
explain
the
awful
alteration
in
his
attitude
not
until
i
returned
to
england
and
settled
down
at
beechcroft
did
i
become
aware
of
the
facts
surely
rita
you
are
romancing
no
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
i
have
seen
the
proofs
proofs
how
can
you
be
certain
who
made
these
statements
to
you
i
have
been
blackmailed
bled
systematically
for
large
sums
of
money
at
first
i
was
beguiled
into
a
correspondence
my
curiosity
was
aroused
by
references
to
my
husband
and
to
my
father
will
finally
i
received
copies
of
documents
which
made
matters
clear
even
to
my
bewildered
brain
more
than
that
i
was
sent
a
memorandum
written
by
my
father
in
which
he
gave
alan
all
the
particulars
corroborated
by
extracts
from
registers
and
explaining
the
reasons
which
actuated
him
in
framing
his
will
so
curiously
we
were
never
closely
knit
together
as
you
know
i
think
now
that
he
regarded
me
as
the
living
evidence
of
the
folly
of
his
earlier
years
and
perhaps
my
sensitive
nature
was
quick
to
detect
this
hidden
feeling
may
i
ask
who
blackmailed
you
robert
face
grew
hard
and
stern
the
woman
experienced
a
tumultuous
joy
as
she
saw
it
she
had
at
least
one
defender
that
is
the
hard
part
of
my
story
she
murmured
in
a
voice
broken
with
emotion
the
correspondence
took
place
with
a
man
named
ooma
a
person
i
never
even
met
at
that
time
and
can
you
believe
it
robert
within
the
past
few
days
i
have
good
reason
to
know
that
he
is
the
murderer
of
my
brother
the
man
who
endeavoured
to
kill
both
you
and
david
frazer
caught
her
by
the
shoulder
rita
he
said
what
has
come
to
you
are
you
hysterical
or
dreaming
oh
for
pity
sake
believe
me
she
moaned
brett
knows
it
is
true
what
is
worse
he
knows
that
i
know
it
i
can
not
bear
this
terrible
secret
any
longer
i
went
to
this
man
house
in
london
the
other
night
and
boldly
charged
him
with
the
crime
he
denied
it
but
i
could
see
the
lie
and
the
fear
in
his
eyes
to
avoid
a
terrible
family
scandal
i
came
here
with
you
all
but
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
god
help
me
and
pity
me
he
will
margaret
you
have
done
no
wrong
that
deserves
so
much
suffering
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
frazer
was
only
able
to
whisper
gentle
and
kindly
words
of
consolation
he
would
have
given
ten
years
of
his
life
to
have
the
right
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
tell
her
that
let
the
world
view
her
conduct
as
it
would
in
his
eyes
she
was
blameless
and
lovable
but
this
was
denied
him
she
was
the
wife
of
another
of
one
who
instead
of
shielding
and
supporting
her
was
even
then
engaged
in
plotting
her
ruin
i
nearly
went
mad
she
continued
at
last
when
i
first
became
acquainted
with
the
truth
concerning
my
parentage
with
calmer
moments
came
the
reflection
that
after
all
i
was
my
father
child
the
sister
of
alan
and
entitled
morally
if
not
legally
to
succeed
to
the
property
my
wealth
has
not
benefited
me
robert
but
at
least
i
have
tried
to
do
good
to
others
you
have
indeed
he
said
tenderly
but
tell
me
about
this
fiend
ooma
you
say
you
saw
him
then
you
were
in
possession
of
his
address
yes
during
the
past
five
months
when
brett
first
appeared
on
the
scene
i
feared
lest
he
should
discover
my
secret
how
could
i
connect
it
with
the
death
of
my
brother
the
explanation
given
to
me
was
that
the
documents
were
purloined
by
a
servant
years
ago
it
was
not
until
the
attacks
on
you
and
davie
and
the
chance
mention
he
made
of
some
curious
marks
in
a
communication
received
by
winter
that
a
horrible
suspicion
awoke
in
my
mind
i
had
received
several
letters
jiro
it
would
appear
had
not
told
evelything
to
brett
and
i
compared
some
of
those
in
london
with
the
description
given
by
davie
they
corresponded
exactly
then
i
resolved
to
make
sure
no
matter
what
the
risk
to
myself
so
i
went
to
a
place
in
kennington
the
last
night
we
were
in
town
and
there
i
saw
ooma
oh
robert
he
is
so
like
you
and
davie
that
at
first
it
seems
to
be
a
romance
only
you
two
look
honest
and
brave
whereas
he
has
the
appearance
of
a
demon
frazer
looked
at
his
watch
brett
ought
to
know
all
these
things
at
once
he
said
let
us
walk
back
to
the
hotel
and
wire
him
perhaps
it
will
be
necessary
for
david
and
me
to
return
to
london
immediately
why
you
are
safe
here
why
should
you
incur
further
risk
he
could
not
help
looking
at
her
a
slight
colour
suffused
her
face
then
he
laughed
savagely
there
will
be
no
risk
rita
once
let
me
meet
ooma
as
man
to
man
and
i
will
teach
him
a
trick
or
two
if
only
for
your
sake
the
law
will
deal
with
him
for
alan
affair
he
has
an
odd
name
it
has
a
japanese
ring
yet
you
say
he
resembles
our
family
margaret
of
course
could
only
describe
him
in
general
terms
as
they
returned
to
the
hotel
she
explained
her
strange
story
in
greater
detail
largely
on
the
lines
already
known
to
brett
in
the
office
they
found
a
telegram
addressed
to
david
but
his
cousin
opened
it
believing
it
might
be
from
brett
it
was
and
read
as
follows
capella

i
know
everything
he
has
to
tell
you
if
he
becomes
offensive
boot
him
robert
did
not
show
the
message
to
his
cousin
he
gave
her
its
general
purport
and
added
prepare
yourself
for
an
ordeal
but
be
brave
perhaps
your
husband
is
in
the
hotel
now
as
he
must
have
reached
here
half
an
hour
ago
he
had
barely
uttered
the
words
when
capella
maid
approached
capella

madam
she
said
and
awaits
you
in
your

if
possible
a

husband
and
wife
the
italian
was
glaring
out
of
a
window
when
they
entered
the
room
he
turned
instantly
with
a
waspish
ferocity
so
madam
he
cried
not
content
with
deceiving
me
from
the
first
moment
we
met
you
have
left
your
home
in
company
with
your
lover
margaret
looked
at
robert
beseechingly
the
sailor
face
was
like
granite
only
his
eyes
flashed
a
warning
that
capella
might
have
noted
were
he
less
blinded
by
passion
do
not
attempt
to
shield
yourself
by
the
presence
of
others
screamed
capella
i
know
that
miss
layton
and
her
father
are
here
that
is
part
of
the
game
you
play
as
for
you
david
hume
or
whatever
you
call
yourself
your
own
record
is
not
so
clean
that
you
should
endeavour
to
cloak
the
misdeeds
of
others
the
italian
had
never
before
seen
robert
to
his
knowledge
he
only
met
david
for
a
few
moments
during
an
angry
scene
at
beechcroft
when
brett
did
most
of
the
talking
the
mistake
he
now
made
was
a
natural
one
it
does
not
occur
to
you
said
robert
in
a
voice
remarkable
for
its
calmness
that
not
content
with
grossly
insulting
your
wife
you
are
attacking
the
reputation
of
a
man
whom
you
do
not
know
pooh
capella
in
his
excitement
snapped
his
fingers
you
are
very
fond
of
defending
your
reputations
a
fig
for
them
you
are
not
worthy
to
consort
with
honourable
people
i
feel
assured
that
when
layton
and
his
daughter
know
the
truth
about
you
they
will
decline
to
associate
with
you
whatever
else
might
be
urged
against
the
italian
he
was
no
coward
such
language
might
well
have
led
to
a
fierce
attack
on
him
by
a
man
so
greatly
his
superior
in
physical
strength
but
robert
sat
down
near
the
door
you
have
some
object
in
coming
here
he
said
what
is
it
margaret
remained
standing
near
the
capella
produced
a
bundle
of
papers
i
am
here
he
said
to
unmask
the
woman
who
unfortunately
bears
my
name
and
at
the
same
time
to
prevent
you
from
getting
miss
layton
to
marry
you
under
false
pretences
a
worthy
programme
observed
frazer
suavely
you
may
attain
the
second
part
of
your
scheme
i
admit
but
the
first
seems
to
be
difficult
is
it
we
shall
see
capella
flourished
his
papers
and
began
a
passionate
avowal
of
the
treachery
practised
on
him
in
the
matter
of
margaret
parentage
ending
by
saying
that
woman
mother
was
the
affianced
bride
of
my
father
she
deceived
him
basely
on
his
he
made
me
vow
my
lifelong
hatred
of
her
betrayer
and
all
his
descendants
to
you
a
englishman
that
perhaps
means
nothing
to
me
it
is
sacred
imperishable
dearer
than
life
and
to
think
that
i
have
been
tricked
into
a
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
the
man
who
was
my
father
enemy
how
mad
i
was
not
to
make
inquiries
what
a
poor
fool
but
i
will
have
my
revenge
i
will
expose
your
accursed
race
in
the
courts
i
will
not
rest
content
until
i
am
free
from
this
snare
margaret
would
have
spoken
but
her
cousin
quickly
forestalled
her
you
bring
two
charges
against
your
wife
robert
said
the
first
is
that
she
deceived
you
before
marriage
the
second
that
she
is
deceiving
you
now
you
contemplate
taking
divorce
proceedings
against
her
i
do
but
you
are
lying
on
both
counts
there
is
no
purer
or
more
honourable
woman
alive
than
she
who
stands
here
at
this
moment
you
are
a
mean
and
despicable
hound
to
endeavour
to
take
advantage
of
circumstances
attending
her
birth
of
which
she
was
in
profound
ignorance
she
can
tell
that
to
a
judge
sneered
the
italian
i
know
better
robert
rose
his
face
white
with
anger
margaret
he
said
you
have
heard
your
precious
husband
views
with
regard
to
you
what
do
you
say
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
no
one
knows
what
tumultuous
thoughts
coursed
through
her
brain
in
that
trying
moment
and
she
answered
i
am
his
true
and
faithful
wife
robert
i
have
never
been
otherwise
in
word
or
deed
capella
started
as
well
he
might
when
he
heard
the
christian
name
of
the
man
who
was
treating
him
with
such
quiet
scorn
so
he
laughed
maliciously
i
have
again
been
fooled
you
are
not
david
but
frazer
strode
towards
him
and
the
words
died
away
on
his
lips
listen
you
blackguard
he
hissed
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
your
wife
i
would
choke
the
miserable
life
out
of
you
go
we
have
done
with
you
you
have
unmasked
your
real
character
and
i
can
not
believe
that
a
spark
of
affection
can
remain
in
your
wife
heart
for
you
after
your
ignoble
conduct
go
i
tell
you
do
your
worst
spit
your
venom
elsewhere
than
in
this
hotel
but
first
let
me
warn
you
if
you
dare
to
approach
miss
layton
i
can
not
promise
that
my
cousin
david
will
treat
you
as
tenderly
as
i
propose
to
do
he
will
probably
thrash
you
until
you
are
unconscious
i
simply
place
you
outside
this
room
he
grabbed
the
italian
by
the
breast
with
his
right
hand
lifted
him
high
in
the
air
gathered
the
papers
from
the
table
in
his
left
hand
and
carried
his
kicking
cursing
but
helpless
adversary
to
the
door
then
he
set
him
down
again
opened
the
door
and
remembering
advice
assisted
him
outside
flinging
the
documents
after
him
and
closing
the
door
with
impotent
rage
in
his
heart
capella
rushed
from
the
hotel
and
caught
the
last
train
to
the
south
he
had
not
been
in
whitby
two
hours
but
he
was
now
embarked
upon
his
vengeful
mission
and
bitterly
resolved
to
push
it
to
the
uttermost
extremity
margaret
had
not
uttered
a
sound
during
the
final
scene
she
stood
as
one
turned
to
stone
robert
did
not
dare
to
speak
to
her
how
could
he
offer
consolation
to
a
woman
whose
tenderest
feelings
had
been
so
wantonly
outraged
robert
she
said
at
last
he
spoke
of
getting
a
divorce
i
believe
he
can
do
this
by
italian
law
here
it
should
be
impossible
in
that
case
he
said
calmly
you
and
i
will
go
and
live
in
italy
she
placed
her
hands
before
her
face
and
burst
into
a
tempest
of
tears
now
my
dear
girl
he
murmured
try
and
forget
that
pitiful
rascal
and
his
threats
you
are
well
rid
of
him
i
will
leave
you
now
for
a
little
while
in
half
an
hour
we
will
go
and
listen
to
the
band
until
dinner
really
we
have
had
a
most
enjoyable
afternoon
he
went
out
placid
and
smiling
and
margaret
sobbed
plentifully
until
it
became
necessary
to
go
to
her
room
and
remove
the
traces
of
her
grief
so
it
may
be
assumed
that
her
tears
were
not
all
occasioned
by
grief
for
the
contemplated
loss
of
her
mate
when
the
others
returned
from
their
excursion
frazer
explained
to
them
all
that
was
needful
with
reference
to
capella
visit
helen
was
very
outspoken
in
her
indignation
and
even
the
rector
condemned
the
conduct
in
plain
terms
he
warmly
approved
of
the
resolution
arrived
at
by
robert
and
david
to
return
to
london
next
day
and
not
leave
brett
until
a
definite
stage
had
been
reached
in
the
strangely
intricate
inquiry
they
were
embarked
on
they
sat
late
into
the
night
discussing
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
situation
yet
among
these
five
people
fully
cognisant
as
they
were
of
nearly
every
fact
known
to
the
able
barrister
who
had
taken
charge
of
their
affairs
not
one
even
remotely
guessed
the
pending
sequel
whilst
they
were
talking
and
hoping
for
some
favourable
outcome
the
night
express
from
york
was
hurrying
capella
to
a
weird
conclusion
of
his
efforts
to
discredit
his
wife
had
he
but
known
what
lay
before
him
he
would
have
left
the
train
at
the
first
station
and
hastened
to
margaret
to
grovel
at
her
feet
and
beg
her
forgiveness
for
the
foul
aspersions
cast
upon
her
it
was
too
late

to
beechcroft
thenceforth
as
the
french
say
events
marched
robert
frazer
faithfully
recounted
margaret
statement
to
the
barrister
and
the
detective
the
documents
copies
of
which
ooma
sent
to
the
woman
whose
sudden
accession
to
wealth
had
proved
so
unlucky
for
her
were
evidently
those
stolen
from
the
drawer
in
the
at
beechcroft
here
at
last
was
the
motive
of
the
murder
laid
bare
the
japanese
by
some
inscrutable
means
became
aware
that
the
young
baronet
possessed
these
papers
and
held
them
over
his
reputed
sister
in
the
hands
of
a
third
person
an
outsider
they
were
endowed
with
double
powers
for
mischief
he
could
threaten
the
woman
with
exposure
the
man
with
the
revelation
of
a
discreditable
family
secret
he
visited
the
library
in
order
to
commit
the
theft
probably
acting
with
greater
daring
because
he
mistook
the
sleeping
david
for
his
cousin
having
successfully
wrenched
open
the
drawer
and
secured
the
papers
still
holding
in
his
hand
the
instrument
used
for
slipping
back
the
tiny
lock
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
by
the
open
window
and
was
suddenly
confronted
by
the
real
sir
alan
who
recognised
him
and
guessed
his
object
in
being
present
at
that
hour
brett
had
gone
thus
far
in
his
spoken
commentary
on
the
affair
as
it
now
presented
itself
to
his
mind
when
winter
asked
why
do
you
say
him
brett
we
have
no
evidence
that
sir
alan
had
ever
seen
ooma
what
none
search
through
your
memory
did
not
the
stationmaster
see
a
third
david
hume
leave
the
station
that
day
when
the
movements
of
only
two
are
known
to
us
what
became
of
this
third
personage
during
the
afternoon
where
did
he
change
into
evening
dress
why
did
sir
alan
leave
documents
of
such
grave
importance
in
so
insecure
a
there
is
no
use
in
asking
me
questions
i
ca
answer
snapped
the
detective
perhaps
not
i
think
you
said
that
you
amused
yourself
in
your
middle
street
lodgings
by
taking
to
pieces
a
small
electrical
machine
fitted
together
by
your
companion
yes
sir
but
what
of
that
let
us
suppose
that
instead
of
a
complex
machine
he
built
a
small
arch
of
toy
bricks
and
you
were
well
acquainted
with
the
model
whilst
each
brick
was
numbered
in
rotation
do
you
think
you
could
manage
to
reconstruct
the
arch
after
repeated
efforts
i
expect
so
well
my
dear
winter
we
have
now
got
together
every
material
stone
in
our
edifice
capella
yielding
to
blackmail
is
the
keystone
of
the
arch
every
loose
block
fits
at
once
into
its
proper
place
the
japanese
ooma
must
have
met
sir
alan
and
discussed
this
very
question
with
him
the
baronet
must
have
unwittingly
revealed
the
family
secret
and
the
jap
was
clever
enough
to
perceive
its
value
further
the
murder
was
unpremeditated
the
inspiration
of
a
desperate
moment
and
the
weapon
selected
shows
a
sort
of
fiendish
mandate
suggested
by
family
feud
ooma
is
undoubtedly
but
smith
entered
apologetic
doubtful
holden
is
here
sir
and
says
he
wishes
to
see
you
immediately
holden
news
was
important
capella
had
left
liverpool
street
half
an
hour
ago
for
beechcroft
and
in
the
same
train
travelled
ooma
are
you
sure
of
this
demanded
brett
excitedly
springing
from
his
chair
quite
certain
sir
winter
mate
followed
him
to
the
station
and
told
me
who
the
japanese
was
besides
no
one
could
mistake
him
who
had
ever
seen
either
of
these
two
gentlemen
he
indicated
robert
and
david
quick
shouted
the
barrister
we
must
all
catch
the
next
train
to
stowmarket
winter
have
you
your
handcuffs
this
time
they
may
be
needed
smith
run
and
call
two
hansoms
he
rushed
to
a
bureau
and
produced
a
couple
of
revolvers
he
handed
one
to
holden
i
can
trust
you
he
said
not
to
fire
without
reason
do
not
shoot
to
kill
if
this
man
threatens
the
life
of
any
person
maim
him
if
possible
but
try
to
avoid
hitting
him
in
the
head
or
body
to
the
frazers
he
handed
the
heaviest
sticks
he
possessed
he
himself
pocketed
the
second
revolver
and
picked
up
the
peculiar
which
ooma
dropped
in
northumberland
avenue
now
he
said
let
us
be
off
we
have
no
time
to
lose
and
we
must
get
to
beechcroft
with
the
utmost
speed
winter
and
he
entered
the
same
hansom
why
are
you
so
anxious
to
prevent
capella
and
ooma
meeting
sir
asked
the
detective
as
their
vehicle
sped
along
victoria
street
i
do
not
care
whether
they
meet
or
not
was
the
emphatic
reply
it
is
now
imperatively
necessary
that
the
japanese
should
be
placed
where
he
can
do
no
further
harm
the
man
is
a
human
tiger
he
must
be
caged
if
all
goes
well
winter
this
case
will
pass
out
of
my
hands
into
yours
within
the
next
three
hours
the
detective
smiled
broadly
at
last
he
saw
his
way
clearly
or
thought
he
saw
it
which
is
often
not
quite
the
same
thing
in
the
present
instance
he
little
dreamed
the
nature
of
the
path
he
would
follow
but
he
was
so
gratified
that
he
could
not
long
maintain
silence
though
brett
was
obviously
disinclined
to
talk
by
jove
he
gurgled
this
will
be
the
case
of
the
year
the
barrister
replied
not
i
suppose
brett
continued
winter
with
concern
you
will
follow
your
usual
policy
and
decide
to
keep
your
connection
with
the
affair
hidden
exactly
and
you
will
follow
your
usual
policy
of
claiming
all
the
credit
under
the
magic
of
the
words
information
received
winter
could
afford
to
be
generous
brett
he
cried
there
is
no
man
would
be
so
pleased
as
i
to
see
you
come
out
of
your
shell
and
tell
the
court
all
you
have
done
you
deserve
it
it
would
be
the
proudest
moment
of
your
life
then
the
barrister
laughed
you
have
known
me
for
years
winter
he
said
yet
you
believe
that
go
to
you
are
incorrigible
the
detective
did
not
trouble
to
extract
the
exact
meaning
from
this
remark
he
understood
that
brett
would
never
think
of
entering
the
that
was
all
he
wanted
to
know
are
you
quite
certain
he
asked
with
a
last
tinge
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
that
ooma
will
be
arrested
quite
certain
if
we
can
accomplish
that
highly
desirable
task
winter
pounded
the
door
of
the
hansom
with
his
clenched
fist
then
it
is
done
he
cried
i
truss
him
up
like
a
fowl
if
he
tries
any
tricks
i
borrow
the
from
stowmarket
police
station
at
liverpool
street
they
all
made
a
hasty
meal
they
caught
the
last
train
from
london
and
passed
two
weary
hours
until
stowmarket
was
reached
there
on
the
platform
stood
the
he
approached
brett
and
whispered
a
man
who
came
here
by
the
preceding
train
told
me
that
you
and
some
other
gentlemen
might
possibly
follow
on
he
intended
to
telegraph
to
you
but
he
asked
me
in
case
you
turned
up
to
tell
you
that
the
japanese
has
gone
on
foot
to
beechcroft
and
that
capella
has
not
arrived
not
arrived
cried
brett
he
turned
to
holden
can
you
have
been
mistaken
holden
shook
his
head
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
he
asseverated
and
to
make
sure
of
his
destination
i
asked
the
ticket
examiner
where
the
gentleman
in
the
first
smoker
was
going
to
it
was
stowmarket
right
enough
there
can
be
no
error
sir
put
in
the
stationmaster
valet
came
by
the
train
and
assured
me
that
he
left
london
with
his
master
besides
the
carriage
is
here
from
the
hall
it
was
ordered
by
telegraph
there
is
the
valet
himself
he
imagines
that
capella
quitted
the
train
on
the
way
and
will
arrive
by
this
one
but
there
is
no
sign
of
him
the
mention
of
the
carriage
brought
a
look
of
decision
into
the
barrister
face
one
more
question
he
said
to
the
official
did
you
see
the
person
described
as
the
japanese
yes
sir
i
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
thought
it
was
somebody
else
it
was
not
until
the
stranger
who
arrived
by
the
train
used
that
name
to
distinguish
him
that
i
understood
i
was
mistaken
the
stationmaster
looked
into
brett
eyes
that
which
he
did
not
like
to
say
in
the
presence
of
the
frazers
of
course
he
had
fallen
into
the
same
error
as
most
people
who
only
obtained
a
casual
glimpse
of
ooma
brett
hurried
his
companions
outside
the
station
there
they
found
the
beechcroft
carriage
and
a
puzzled
valet
holding
parley
with
the
coachman
and
footman
david
hume
authority
was
sufficient
to
secure
the
use
of
the
vehicle
and
brett
made
the
position
easier
for
the
men
by
saying
that
in
all
probability
they
would
find
fresh
instructions
awaiting
them
at
the
hall
before
the
party
drove
off
winter
noticed
a
local
sergeant
of
police
standing
near
shall
i
ask
him
to
come
with
us
sir
he
said
to
brett
the
barrister
considered
the
point
for
an
instant
before
replying
perhaps
it
would
be
better
as
we
have
not
got
a
warrant
winter
grinned
broadly
again
oh
yes
we
have
he
cried
ooma
warrant
has
been
in
my
for
three
days
what
a
thoughtful
fellow
you
are
murmured
brett
in
that
case
we
can
dispense
with
local
assistance
we
five
can
surely
tackle
any
man
living
what
can
have
become
of
capella
said
david
hume
when
they
were
all
seated
and
bowling
along
the
road
to
beechcroft
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
such
a
mad
ass
would
be
up
to
commented
his
cousin
he
has
probably
gone
back
to
london
from
some
wayside
station
and
failed
to
find
his
servant
to
tell
him
before
the
train
moved
on
what
do
you
think
mr
brett
inquired
winter
i
can
form
no
opinion
i
only
wish
ooma
was
in
gaol
for
once
winter
i
appreciate
the
strength
of
your
handcuffing
policy
chapter
xxxii
the
fight
it
was
almost
dark
by
the
time
they
reached
the
lodge
gates
brett
moved
by
impulse
stopped
the
carriage
in
the
main
road
the
others
alighted
after
him
crowe
the
wife
opened
the
gates
and
evidently
wondered
why
the
carriage
did
not
enter
good
evening
crowe
said
brett
advancing
have
you
seen
a
telegraph
messenger
recently
lawk
sir
she
cried
i
did
recognise
you
in
the
gloom
no
sir
there
been
no
messenger
only
then
she
uttered
a
startled
exclamation
why
there
david
an
robert
i
could
ha
sworn
one
of
you
gentlemen
walked
up
to
the
house
five
minutes
ago
an
i
wunnered
you
never
took
no
notice
of
me
well
of
all
the
strange
things
it
was
a
natural
mistake
said
the
barrister
quietly
then
he
told
the
coachman
to
wait
where
he
was
until
a
message
reached
him
from
the
house
he
did
not
want
to
disturb
the
visitor
who
had
caused
crowe
to
wunner
nor
was
there
any
use
in
sending
the
carriage
back
to
stowmarket
somehow
he
felt
that
capella
would
not
come
to
beechcroft
that
night
the
five
men
went
rapidly
and
silently
up
the
avenue
as
they
approached
the
lighted
library
they
could
see
a
servant
parleying
with
the
japanese
a
motion
of
brett
hand
brought
the
party
into
the
shade
of
the
sombre
yews
you
and
holden
he
said
to
hume
go
round
to
the
main
entrance
proceed
at
once
to
the
library
door
enter
the
room
and
lock
the
door
behind
you
be
ready
with
your
stick
and
do
not
hesitate
to
lunge
hard
if
ooma
attacks
you
you
holden
keep
the
revolver
handy
it
must
only
be
used
to
save
life
the
moment
you
appear
at
the
door
we
will
rush
to
the
window
which
is
open
ooma
must
have
entered
that
way
you
both
understand
they
nodded
and
walked
off
clinging
to
the
line
of
the
trees
the
others
closed
up
timing
their
approach
with
perfect
judgment
they
crept
over
the
gravelled
road
at
the
bend
and
gained
the
turf
in
front
of
the
window
ooma
back
was
towards
them
they
could
hear
his
voice
a
queer
yet
strident
voice
whilst
he
questioned
a
somewhat
scared
footman
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
his
mistress
the
man
had
evidently
perceived
the
remarkable
resemblance
borne
by
this
uncanny
stranger
to
the
frazer
family
his
replies
were
respectful
but
stuttering
he
was
alarmed
by
those
fierce
eyes
more
especially
because
his
inability
to
give
satisfactory
information
seemed
to
anger
the
you
are
not
a
child
they
heard
ooma
say
with
menace
in
his
tone
you
must
have
heard
from
her
maid
or
some
other
source
where
capella
has
gone
to
n
no
sir
stammered
the
man
i
really
i
t
t
thought
c
capella
was
in
london
the
b
butler
says
we
are
all
to
a
next
week
is
there
no
way
in
which
i
can
find
out
where
your
mistress
is
at
this
moment
i
must
see
her
my
business
is
important
it
can
not
wait
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
her
brett
straining
without
like
a
hound
in
the
leash
could
note
a
slight
accentuation
in
the
perfect
english
spoken
by
ooma
there
was
just
a
suspicion
of
the
liquid
r
so
strongly
marked
in
jiro
utterance
what
an
uncanny
thing
is
heredity
it
even
alters
the
shape
of
the
roof
of
the
mouth
the
japanese
of
english
descent
could
necessarily
pronounce
english
better
than
the
native
the
servant
within
seemed
to
rack
his
brains
for
a
favourable
reply
you
might
ask
capella
sir
he
said
at
length
with
some
degree
of
returning
confidence
he
was
expected
here
by
the
last
train
but
missed
it
in
london
i
expect
he
is
sure
to
come
and
he
will
tell
you
if
you
care
to
wait
capella
coming
by
the
last
train
what
is
he
like
do
you
mean
in
appearance
sir
he
is
a
small
gentleman
with
wavy
black
hair
and
a
very
pale
face
he
but
ooma
turned
away
from
the
man
and
looked
through
the
window
with
the
lambent
glare
of
a
wild
animal
in
his
eyes
he
instantly
saw
the
three
motionless
figures
brett
winter
and
robert
they
sprang
forward
robert
was
quickest
and
reached
the
open
window
first
the
japanese
jumped
back
and
made
for
the
door
but
it
opened
in
his
face
and
david
entered
the
room
behind
him
was
holden
who
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
carried
a
revolver
ooma
caught
the
astounded
by
the
waist
lifted
him
as
though
he
were
a
truss
of
straw
and
threw
him
bodily
at
robert
frazer
and
winter
bringing
both
to
the
ground
by
this
singular
weapon
it
was
a
fatal
mistake
to
attack
the
readiest
means
of
exit
had
he
used
his
human
battering
ram
against
holden
and
david
he
might
have
escaped
but
now
he
looked
into
the
muzzle
of
another
revolver
and
heard
stern
demand
hands
up
ooma
if
you
move
you
are
a
dead
man
nevertheless
he
did
move
he
seemed
to
have
the
agility
as
well
as
the
semblance
of
a
carnivorous
animal
he
bounded
sideways
towards
the
wall
of
the
library
picked
up
the
and
barricaded
himself
behind
it
in
the
same
second
he
produced
a
small
shining
article
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
shouted
in
a
voice
now
cracked
with
rage
stand
back
all
of
you
you
may
shoot
me
i
will
not
be
arrested
winter
swearing
scrambled
from
the
floor
robert
too
threw
off
the
yelling
servant
and
rose
to
his
feet
alarmed
not
only
by
the
curious
entry
made
by
david
hume
and
holden
but
also
by
the
racket
in
the
library
other
servants
were
now
clamouring
at
the
locked
door
for
holden
had
slipped
his
left
hand
behind
him
and
turned
the
key
brett
similarly
closed
the
window
they
were
five
to
one
but
the
one
seemed
to
defy
them
that
be
blowed
for
a
tale
roared
the
infuriated
detective
whose
blood
was
fired
by
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
floored
i
arrest
you
in
the
king
name
for
the
murder
of
sir
alan
and
i
warn
you
robert
waited
for
no
preliminary
explanation
of
an
official
character
he
wanted
to
feel
that
man
bones
crack
under
his
grasp
he
had
the
strong
man
ambition
to
close
with
an
opponent
worthy
of
his
thews
and
sinews
without
any
warning
he
made
for
the
japanese
who
seemed
to
await
his
oncoming
with
singular
equanimity
though
otherwise
quivering
with
baulked
hate
but
brett
had
seen
something
that
aroused
a
suspicion
twice
had
the
japanese
looked
at
a
small
shining
thing
in
his
hand
as
though
to
make
sure
it
was
there
so
the
barrister
was
just
in
time
to
grasp
robert
shoulder
and
hold
him
back
no
he
cried
you
must
not
touch
him
i
command
it
he
can
not
escape
then
let
me
have
a
go
at
him
first
growled
frazer
whose
face
was
pale
with
passion
no
no
leave
him
to
me
winter
do
you
hear
me
stand
back
i
say
brett
imperative
tone
brooked
no
disobedience
thus
in
a
segment
of
a
circle
the
five
enclosed
the
one
against
the
wall
ooma
barricaded
by
the
table
the
others
ready
to
defeat
any
stratagem
he
might
endeavour
to
put
in
force
now
listen
to
me
ooma
said
the
barrister
sternly
you
must
drop
that
thing
you
have
in
your
right
hand
you
must
hold
both
your
hands
high
above
your
head
if
you
move
either
of
them
again
i
will
shoot
you
if
you
do
not
obey
me
before
i
count
five
i
will
shoot
you
one
two
three
the
japanese
gasping
a
horrible
sort
of
sob
three
times
plunged
the
instrument
he
held
into
his
left
arm
then
he
flung
it
straight
at
robert
one
would
have
thought
his
vengeance
would
be
directed
against
brett
whom
he
must
have
credited
by
this
time
with
his
capture
no
he
singled
out
a
for
his
last
attack
the
instrument
struck
a
button
on
robert
coat
and
fell
to
the
floor
where
it
lay
twisted
out
of
shape
by
the
force
of
the
impact
it
was
a
hypodermic
syringe
again
ooma
uttered
that
weird
cry
this
is
the
end
he
said
you
have
not
beaten
me
it
is
fate
he
folded
his
arms
and
looked
at
them
a
change
came
over
his
face
he
was
no
longer
a
tiger
at
bay
but
a
human
being
calm
dignified
almost
impressive
i
arrest
you
began
winter
you
fool
laughed
the
japanese
with
a
quiet
contempt
in
his
tone
i
shall
be
dead
in
twenty
minutes
that
syringe
contained
snake
poison
the
undiluted
venom
of
the
karait
put
away
your
pistols
they
are
not
wanted
quite
nonchalantly
he
leaned
back
against
the
bookcase
that
lined
the
wall
he
turned
his
eyes
to
robert
you
have
the
luck
of
your
race
he
said
if
that
point
had
reached
your
skin
no
human
skill
could
have
saved
you
as
it
is
you
are
spared
and
i
must
go
the
same
blood
flows
in
our
veins
yet
you
are
my
enemy
i
wish
i
could
once
get
my
fingers
round
your
throat
before
my
strength
fails
come
from
behind
that
table
and
try
was
the
quick
rejoinder
ooma
made
to
accept
the
challenge
but
brett
intervened
if
you
are
telling
the
truth
he
said
you
can
spend
your
brief
remaining
span
of
life
to
better
purpose
than
in
a
mad
combat
with
one
who
has
done
you
no
harm
where
is
capella
i
killed
him
was
the
cool
reply
the
footman
who
had
slowly
regained
his
senses
uttered
a
groan
of
horror
by
this
time
several
men
not
alone
house
servants
but
gardeners
grooms
and
others
had
gathered
on
the
lawn
send
away
that
slave
cried
ooma
impatiently
and
tell
those
others
to
go
to
their
kennels
this
is
no
place
for
such
brett
knew
that
the
japanese
was
in
truth
about
to
die
afterwards
winter
and
holden
confessed
that
they
thought
the
pretence
of
injecting
snake
poison
was
a
mere
ruse
to
gain
time
robert
and
david
intuitively
agreed
with
the
barrister
it
was
in
their
breed
to
know
when
eternity
yawned
for
one
of
them
the
very
calmness
of
the
criminal
his
magnificent
apathy
his
dislike
of
vulgar
witnesses
foreboded
a
tragedy
brett
motioned
to
holden
to
open
the
door
and
the
footman
gladly
made
his
escape
in
response
to
a
wave
of
the
barrister
arm
the
other
servants
disappeared
from
view
though
they
probably
only
retreated
to
a
greater
distance
and
could
see
well
enough
all
that
happened
yes
continued
ooma
i
killed
capella
it
was
a
mistake
everything
is
a
mistake
it
was
foolish
on
my
part
to
kill
alan
even
though
he
was
my
enemy
i
should
have
let
him
live
and
tortured
him
by
fear
you
english
dread
these
scandals
worse
than
death
we
japanese
fear
neither
for
i
am
a
japanese
and
i
am
proud
of
it
although
my
ancestor
was
david
hume
of
glen
tochan
who
fought
and
killed
the
man
who
robbed
his
father
but
how
and
why
did
you
kill
capella
asked
brett
i
saw
him
in
the
station
at
london
he
followed
me
i
puzzled
him
i
suppose
he
perceived
the
likeness
between
me
and
my
dear
cousins
we
are
like
one
another
are
we
not
we
he
laughed
mirthlessly
and
stared
at
david
and
robert
alternately
winter
broke
in
with
a
hasty
question
if
he
is
speaking
the
truth
about
the
snake
poison
should
we
send
for
a
doctor
no
one
had
thought
of
this
previously
brett
reproached
himself
for
his
forgetfulness
so
strange
are
our
civilised
notions
that
we
strive
to
save
a
man
life
in
order
to
hang
him
by
due
process
at
law
it
was
ooma
who
answered
doctor
he
cried
bring
him
bring
the
whole
college
of
surgeons
they
can
watch
me
die
and
tell
you
learnedly
why
the
blood
curdles
and
the
heart
refuses
to
act
but
not
all
their
science
can
beat
the
venom
of
the
little
karait
it
is
an
indian
snake
more
deadly
than
the
cobra
with
mightier
tooth
than
the
tiger
i
meant
to
use
that
syringe
on
the
whole
cursed
brood
of
frazers
in
this
country
no
one
would
have
known
what
happened
to
them
but
look
you
fate
is
too
powerful
the
karait
stored
his
poison
for
me
only
i
killed
only
one
of
the
race
and
him
i
stabbed
with
a
of
my
own
house
holden
left
the
room
to
send
a
messenger
for
the
village
doctor
about
capella
persisted
brett
ah
capella
he
sought
his
own
death
he
looked
at
me
so
oddly
that
i
thought
him
a
spy
i
was
alone
in
a
carriage
when
here
he
ran
along
the
platform
at
a
small
station
and
joined
me
he
began
to
question
me
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
that
we
were
coming
to
a
viaduct
over
a
stream
between
deep
cliffs
so
i
took
the
little
man
and
cracked
his
neck
then
i
flung
him
over
the
bridge
it
was
a
mistake
he
should
have
left
me
alone
he
described
this
murder
of
the
unfortunate
italian
with
the
weary
air
of
one
who
recites
a
tedious
episode
the
lids
drooped
heavily
over
his
eyes
i
am
tired
he
said
that
was
a
good
little
snake
he
knew
his
business
he
could
make
the
best
of
poison
surely
said
the
barrister
solemnly
you
are
not
so
utterly
inhuman
that
at
the
very
point
of
death
you
still
maintain
the
attitude
of
a
disappointed
avenger
what
wrong
had
all
these
people
done
you
to
demand
your
murderous
hate
ooma
seemed
for
a
moment
to
rouse
himself
from
lethargy
once
again
the
black
eyes
sparkled
with
their
menacing
gleam
it
is
you
he
cried
you
the
thinker
who
question
me
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
you
or
i
would
not
now
be
slowly
sinking
into
death
i
might
have
guessed
that
a
higher
intelligence
was
at
work
than
that
which
saw
the
with
its
motto
and
yet
failed
to
read
its
story
you
ask
my
motives
can
a
man
explain
heredity
here
and
he
threw
a
packet
of
papers
on
the
are
the
proofs
of
my
identity
it
is
not
long
ago
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
since
david
hume
was
robbed
of
his
birthright
and
what
is
such
a
period
to
the
old
families
of
england
and
japan
there
are
men
living
in
japan
who
saw
his
son
in
the
flesh
i
am
his
lawful
descendant
i
came
to
england
and
resolved
to
be
an
englishman
but
i
needed
money
do
you
remember
our
motto
new
field
gives
a
small
crop
the
first
japanese
hume
did
not
prosper
he
was
a
good
fighter
but
he
saved
no
yen
so
i
applied
to
my
family
i
came
here
on
the
new
year
eve
and
sir
alan
saw
me
walking
up
the
avenue
he
stepped
out
through
that
window
to
meet
me
he
was
surprised
at
my
appearance
and
thought
i
was
his
cousin
robert
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
years
at
this
remarkable
statement
the
four
listeners
chiefly
concerned
looked
wonderingly
at
each
other
the
main
incidents
of
the
family
feud
were
repeating
themselves
in
a
ghostly
manner
ooma
paid
no
heed
to
their
amazement
he
staggered
unsteadily
to
a
chair
and
sank
into
it
limply
it
was
the
chair
which
david
hume
occupied
when
he
slept
and
dreamed
not
even
winter
saw
cause
for
suspicion
in
the
act
ooma
was
dying
his
yellow
skin
was
now
green
his
lips
were
white
his
whole
frame
was
sinking
at
this
phase
he
became
a
japanese
and
lost
all
likeness
to
the
frazers
he
continued
with
an
odd
cackle
i
kept
up
the
error
i
demanded
money
as
my
right
and
from
his
words
i
gathered
that
the
frazers
had
been
at
their
old
tricks
and
defrauded
another
relative
robert
started
do
you
hear
he
murmured
to
brett
that
accounts
for
alan
strange
reception
of
me
the
same
day
brett
held
up
a
warning
hand
ooma
was
still
talking
i
taunted
him
with
thriving
on
the
plunder
of
his
own
people
that
made
him
furious
he
raved
about
the
world
being
in
league
against
him
the
only
relative
he
loved
one
who
was
more
than
brother
had
stolen
the
woman
he
wished
to
marry
his
sister
was
a
living
lie
his
cousin
a
blackmailer
i
laughed
you
disown
your
sister
then
i
asked
he
took
from
his
some
papers
you
will
find
them
there
on
the
table
and
told
me
in
great
anger
that
he
possessed
proof
that
she
was
not
his
sister
i
was
cooler
than
he
and
saw
the
value
of
this
admission
i
pretended
to
go
away
but
hid
among
the
trees
and
saw
him
walk
about
the
library
for
nearly
an
hour
i
meant
to
enter
the
house
if
an
opportunity
presented
itself
and
trusting
to
my
appearance
go
to
his
bedroom
if
he
changed
his
clothes
and
went
out
but
he
helped
me
by
placing
the
papers
in
the
drawer
which
i
afterwards
broke
open
i
saw
him
meet
you
he
feebly
pointed
to
robert
i
saw
you
arrive
in
the
carriage
and
he
indicated
david
then
i
determined
to
wait
until
the
night
i
went
back
to
stowmarket
where
i
left
a
portmanteau
at
a
small
hotel
brett
knew
that
winter
stole
a
look
at
him
but
he
ignored
the
fact
and
changed
my
clothes
in
england
at
night
a
man
in
evening
dress
can
enter
almost
any
house
when
i
returned
i
carried
my
bag
with
me
as
i
did
not
know
how
i
might
wish
to
get
away
subsequently
i
saw
the
preparations
for
the
ball
they
helped
me
david
hume
unexpected
appearance
at
midnight
upset
my
plans
waiting
near
the
gate
i
witnessed
alan
meeting
with
a
girl
in
a
white
dress
whilst
they
were
talking
i
ran
up
to
the
house
and
found
david
asleep
in
the
library
i
resolved
to
act
boldly
even
he
would
not
know
what
to
do
if
he
suddenly
discovered
another
frazer
in
the
room
to
force
open
the
drawer
i
picked
up
the
japanese
sword
and
knew
it
as
belonging
to
my
house
by
the
device
on
the
handle
of
the
the
thing
inspired
me
i
obtained
the
papers
and
was
going
out
when
i
met
alan
he
had
seen
what
i
was
doing
he
called
me
a
cur
and
the
memory
of
my
ancestor
vengeance
rushed
on
me
so
i
struck
him
with
the
knife
and
left
it
resting
in
his
heart
as
he
fell
afterwards
it
was
easy
no
one
knew
me
those
who
had
seen
me
thought
that
i
was
either
david
or
robert
i
depended
on
the
police
and
the
servants
to
complete
the
mystery
they
did
i
saw
david
meet
the
same
girl
in
a
white
dress
near
the
lodge
so
i
sent
the
which
i
made
jiro
write
for
me
he
wrote
it
badly
which
was
all
the
better
for
my
purpose
i
meant
david
to
be
hanged
by
the
law
then
i
would
marry
margaret
that
is
all
give
me
some
brandy
i
am
dreaming
now
i
can
see
curling
shapes
ah
he
gulped
down
half
a
tumblerful
of
raw
spirits
hastily
procured
by
brett
again
he
attempted
to
shake
off
the
torpid
state
that
was
slowly
mastering
him
he
lifted
his
eyes
feebly
to
brett
face
and
his
face
contorted
in
a
ghastly
smile
you
he
croaked
i
should
have
killed
you
you
carried
my
stick
that
night
in
middle
street
why
was
i
not
warned
did
you
follow
the
girl
from
the
hotel
i
was
a
fool
i
tried
to
stop
the
inquiry
by
getting
rid
of
david
as
if
he
had
brains
enough
to
get
on
my
track
about
that
girl
she
believes
in
me
she
does
not
know
anything
of
my
past
do
not
tell
her
try
to
help
her
she
is
coarse
one
of
the
people
as
you
say
here
but
she
has
courage
and
is
faithful
help
her
his
head
drooped
the
action
of
the
brandy
whilst
momentarily
stimulating
the
heart
helped
the
stupefaction
of
the
brain
it
was
a
question
of
a
minute
perhaps
two
why
did
you
come
here
asked
brett
quickly
to
see
margaret
she
would
give
me
money
i
was
going
away
that
man
i
threw
from
the
train
was
her
husband
he
was
not
a
proper
mate
for
a
frazer
or
a
hume
we
are
an
old
race
of
soldiers
we
know
how
to
die
four
of
us
fell
fighting
in
japan
i
am
dying
what
a
pity
his
head
sank
lower
his
breath
grew
faint
his
voice
died
away
in
unintelligible
words
after
a
brief
silence
he
spoke
again
the
words
he
used
were
japanese
in
his
weakened
consciousness
all
he
could
recollect
was
the
language
he
learnt
from
his
japanese
mother
the
mother
he
despised
when
he
became
a
man
and
knew
his
history
winter
and
brett
were
now
holding
him
the
others
drew
apart
they
afterwards
confessed
that
the
death
of
this
murderer
this
of
their
race
affected
them
greatly
he
was
fearless
to
the
end
the
way
in
which
he
quitted
life
became
him
more
than
the
manner
in
which
he
lived
there
was
a
bustle
without
and
the
local
doctor
entered
he
looked
wise
profound
even
ventured
on
a
sceptical
remark
when
the
barrister
explained
that
ooma
had
injected
into
his
arm
but
he
lifted
the
eyelids
of
the
figure
in
the
chair
and
glanced
at
the
pupils
whatever
the
cause
of
death
may
be
he
is
undoubtedly
dead
was
his
verdict
chapter
xxxiii
the
last
note
in
brett
diary
winter
and
holden
were
invaluable
during
the
trying
hours
that
followed
acting
in
conjunction
with
the
local
police
they
caused
a
search
to
be
made
for
capella
body
it
was
found
easily
enough
only
once
did
the
line
cross
such
a
place
as
that
described
by
ooma
and
a
bruised
and
battered
corpse
was
taken
out
of
the
stream
beneath
the
viaduct
meanwhile
winter
writing
from
brett
dictation
drew
up
a
complete
statement
of
all
the
facts
retailed
by
the
japanese
in
relation
to
the
murders
of
sir
alan
and
the
unfortunate
italian
this
they
signed
and
went
to
obtain
the
signatures
of
the
two
cousins
holden
and
the
for
whom
a
special
short
statement
had
been
prepared
this
is
for
use
at
the
coroner
inquest
i
suppose
inquired
david
yes
said
brett
we
must
seize
that
opportunity
to
publish
all
the
evidence
needed
to
thoroughly
acquit
you
of
suspicion
in
relation
to
your
cousin
death
by
prior
consultation
with
the
coroner
we
can
if
you
think
fit
keep
out
of
the
inquiry
all
allusions
to
mrs
capella
it
would
certainly
be
the
best
thing
to
do
agreed
david
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
robert
and
i
have
burnt
those
beastly
papers
he
pointed
to
some
shivering
ashes
in
the
grate
of
the
for
ooma
occupied
the
library
in
the
last
solemn
stateliness
of
his
final
appearance
on
earth
what
cried
brett
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
destroyed
the
documents
deposited
by
the
japanese
on
the
not
exactly
all
was
the
cool
reply
we
picked
out
those
referring
to
margaret
and
made
an
end
of
them
we
hope
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
with
regard
to
papers
discovered
on
capella
body
or
among
his
belongings
those
bearing
on
ooma
himself
are
here
and
he
pointed
to
a
small
packet
neatly
tied
up
reposing
on
the
mantelpiece
you
have
done
a
somewhat
serious
thing
we
do
care
a
cent
about
that
robert
and
i
have
both
agreed
that
what
margaret
has
she
keeps
there
may
in
course
of
time
be
very
good
reason
for
this
action
anyhow
i
have
acted
to
please
myself
and
my
father
will
i
am
sure
approve
of
what
i
have
done
brett
shook
his
head
no
lawyer
could
approve
of
these
settlements
of
important
family
affairs
has
anyone
telegraphed
to
mrs
capella
he
inquired
yes
said
robert
i
did
i
just
said
dead
capella
reported
seriously
ill
remain
in
whitby
i
will
join
you
evening
that
i
thought
was
enough
for
a
start
it
certainly
was
soon
there
came
excited
messages
from
both
margaret
and
helen
demanding
more
details
whereupon
brett
who
knew
that
suspense
was
more
unbearable
than
full
knowledge
sent
a
fairly
complete
account
of
occurrences
during
the
next
few
days
there
was
the
usual
commotion
in
the
press
that
follows
the
opening
up
of
the
secret
records
of
a
great
and
mysterious
crime
it
came
as
a
tremendous
surprise
to
david
to
learn
how
many
people
were
convinced
of
his
innocence
all
the
time
being
the
central
figure
in
the
affair
he
was
compelled
to
remain
at
beechcroft
until
capella
and
ooma
were
interred
and
the
coroner
jury
at
a
deferred
inquest
had
recorded
their
verdict
that
the
wretched
japanese
descendant
of
the
scottish
jacobite
was
not
only
doubly
a
murderer
but
guilty
of
the
heinous
crime
of
de
brett
in
the
interim
saw
to
the
despatch
of
the
italian
witnesses
back
to
naples
these
good
people
did
not
know
why
they
had
been
brought
to
england
but
they
returned
to
their
sunny
land
fully
persuaded
that
the
english
were
both
very
rich
and
very
foolish
winter
in
accordance
with
brett
promise
secured
a
fresh
holiday
towards
the
close
of
august
and
had
the
supreme
joy
of
shooting
over
a
scotch
moor
at
last
one
day
in
september
brett
was
summoned
to
whitby
to
assist
at
a
family
conclave
he
found
that
margaret
was
firm
in
her
resolve
never
again
to
live
at
beechcroft
she
and
robert
intended
to
get
married
early
in
the
new
year
and
sail
forthwith
for
the
argentine
where
with
the
help
of
his
money
robert
could
develop
his
magnificent
estate
beechroft
would
pass
into
the
possession
of
david
and
helen
and
he
who
were
to
be
married
in
october
would
settle
down
in
the
house
after
their
honeymoon
but
on
one
point
they
were
all
very
emphatic
that
library
window
should
pass
into
the
limbo
of
things
that
have
been
already
builders
were
converting
the
library
into
an
entrance
hall
and
the
main
door
would
occupy
its
natural
place
in
the
front
of
the
house
let
us
hope
that
the
return
of
the
young
couple
after
their
marriage
marked
a
new
era
for
an
abode
hitherto
singled
out
for
tragedy
their
start
was
auspicious
enough
for
true
love
in
their
case
neither
ran
smoothly
nor
yielded
to
the
pressure
of
terrible
events
and
jiro
went
to
japan
with
them
they
took
the
girl
rose
dew
and
the
last
heard
of
them
was
that
the
trio
were
running
a
in
yeddo
where
jiro
advertised
the
excellence
of
the
food
she
supplied
and
miss
dew
sternly
repressed
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
lodgers
to
obtain
credit
the
last
entry
in
brett
under
the
heading
of
the
stowmarket
mystery
is
dated
six
months
after
the
departure
of
and
robert
for
the
argentine
it
reads
is
the
anniversary
of
david
hume
first
visit
to
my
chambers
this
morning
i
discovered
in
a
corner
dusty
and
forlorn
ooma
it
reminded
me
of
a
snake
that
was
hibernating
so
i
gave
it
to
smith
and
told
him
to
light
the
kitchen
fire
with
it
then
i
telegraphed
to
old
sir
david
saying
that
i
gladly
accepted
his
invitation
for
the
his
son
it
seems
can
not
go
north
as
he
does
not
wish
to
leave
his
wife
during
the
next
couple
of
months
i
suppose
i
shall
be
a
godfather
at
an
early
date
the
end
