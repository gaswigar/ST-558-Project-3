i
introducing
raffles
holmes
it
was
a
blistering
night
in
august
all
day
long
the
mercury
in
the
thermometer
had
been
flirting
with
the
figures
at
the
top
of
the
tube
and
the
promised
shower
at
night
which
a
mendacious
weather
bureau
had
been
prophesying
as
a
slight
mitigation
of
our
sufferings
was
conspicuous
wholly
by
its
absence
i
had
but
one
comfort
in
the
sweltering
hours
of
the
day
afternoon
and
evening
and
that
was
that
my
family
were
away
in
the
mountains
and
there
was
no
law
against
my
sitting
around
all
day
clad
only
in
my
pajamas
and
otherwise
concealed
from
possibly
intruding
eyes
by
the
wreaths
of
smoke
that
i
extracted
from
the
nineteen
or
twenty
cigars
which
when
there
is
no
protesting
eye
to
suggest
otherwise
form
my
daily
allowance
i
had
tried
every
method
known
to
the
resourceful
of
modern
times
to
get
cool
and
to
stay
so
but
alas
it
was
impossible
even
the
radiators
which
all
winter
long
had
never
once
given
forth
a
spark
of
heat
now
hissed
to
the
touch
of
my
moistened
finger
enough
cooling
drinks
to
float
an
ocean
greyhound
had
passed
into
my
inner
man
with
no
other
result
than
to
make
me
perspire
more
profusely
than
ever
and
in
so
far
as
sensations
went
to
make
me
feel
hotter
than
before
finally
as
a
last
resource
along
about
midnight
its
gridiron
floor
having
had
a
chance
to
lose
some
of
its
warmth
i
climbed
out
upon
the
at
the
rear
of
the
richmere
hitched
my
hammock
from
one
of
the
railings
thereof
to
the
leader
running
from
the
roof
to
the
area
and
swung
myself
therein
some
eighty
feet
above
the
concealed
pavement
of
our
backyard
so
called
perhaps
because
of
its
dimensions
which
were
just
about
that
square
it
was
a
little
improvement
though
nothing
to
brag
of
what
fitful
zephyrs
there
might
be
caused
no
doubt
by
the
rapid
passage
to
and
fro
on
the
roof
above
and
below
of
vagrant
felines
on
cupid
contentious
battles
bent
to
the
disturbance
of
the
still
air
soughed
softly
through
the
meshes
of
my
hammock
and
gave
some
measure
of
relief
grateful
enough
for
which
i
ceased
the
perfervid
language
i
had
been
using
practically
since
sunrise
and
dozed
off
and
then
there
entered
upon
the
scene
that
marvelous
man
raffles
holmes
of
whose
exploits
it
is
the
purpose
of
these
papers
to
tell
i
had
dozed
perhaps
for
a
full
hour
when
the
first
strange
sounds
grated
upon
my
ear
somebody
had
opened
a
window
in
the
kitchen
of
the
apartment
below
and
with
a
dark
lantern
was
inspecting
the
iron
platform
of
the
without
a
moment
later
this
somebody
crawled
out
of
the
window
and
with
movements
that
in
themselves
were
a
sufficient
indication
of
the
questionable
character
of
his
proceedings
made
for
the
ladder
leading
to
the
floor
above
upon
which
many
a
time
and
oft
had
i
too
climbed
to
home
and
safety
when
an
inconsiderate
janitor
had
locked
me
out
every
step
that
he
took
was
stealthy
that
much
i
could
see
by
the
dim
starlight
his
lantern
he
had
turned
dark
again
evidently
lest
he
should
attract
attention
in
the
apartments
below
as
he
passed
their
windows
in
his
upward
flight
ha
ha
thought
i
to
myself
it
never
too
hot
for
mr
sneak
to
get
in
his
fine
work
i
wonder
whose
stuff
he
is
after
turning
over
flat
on
my
stomach
so
that
i
might
the
more
readily
observe
the
man
movements
and
breathing
pianissimo
lest
he
in
turn
should
observe
mine
i
watched
him
as
he
climbed
up
he
came
as
silently
as
the
midnight
mouse
upon
a
soft
carpet
up
past
the
jorkins
apartments
on
the
second
floor
up
stealthily
by
the
tinkletons
abode
on
the
third
up
past
the
italian
garden
of
little
persimmon
on
the
fourth
up
past
the
windows
of
the
disagreeable
garraways
kitchen
below
mine
and
then
with
the
easy
grace
of
a
feline
zip
he
silently
landed
within
reach
of
my
hand
on
my
own
little
iron
veranda
and
craning
his
neck
to
one
side
peered
in
through
the
open
window
and
listened
intently
for
two
full
minutes
humph
whispered
my
inner
consciousness
to
itself
he
is
the
coolest
thing
i
seen
since
last
christmas
left
town
i
wonder
what
he
is
up
to
there
nothing
in
my
apartment
worth
stealing
now
that
my
wife
and
children
are
away
unless
it
be
my
jap
valet
nogi
who
might
make
a
very
excellent
cab
driver
if
i
could
only
find
words
to
convey
to
his
mind
the
idea
that
he
is
discharged
and
then
the
visitor
apparently
having
correctly
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
one
within
stepped
across
the
window
sill
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
of
my
kitchen
a
moment
later
i
too
entered
the
window
in
pursuit
not
so
close
a
one
however
as
to
acquaint
him
with
my
proximity
i
wanted
to
see
what
the
chap
was
up
to
and
also
being
totally
unarmed
and
ignorant
as
to
whether
or
not
he
carried
dangerous
weapons
i
determined
to
go
slow
for
a
little
while
moreover
the
situation
was
not
wholly
devoid
of
novelty
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
here
at
last
was
abundant
opportunity
for
a
new
sensation
as
he
had
entered
so
did
he
walk
cautiously
along
the
narrow
bowling
alley
that
serves
for
a
hallway
connecting
my
and
library
with
the
until
he
came
to
the
library
into
which
he
disappeared
this
was
not
reassuring
to
me
because
to
tell
the
truth
i
value
my
books
more
than
i
do
my
plate
and
if
i
were
to
be
robbed
i
should
much
have
preferred
his
taking
my
plated
plate
from
the
than
any
one
of
my
sets
of
the
works
of
marie
corelli
hall
caine
and
other
standard
authors
from
the
library
shelves
once
in
the
library
he
quietly
drew
the
shades
at
the
windows
thereof
to
bar
possible
intruding
eyes
from
without
turned
on
the
electric
lights
and
proceeded
to
go
through
my
papers
as
calmly
and
coolly
as
though
they
were
his
own
in
a
short
time
apparently
he
found
what
he
wanted
in
the
shape
of
a
royalty
statement
recently
received
by
me
from
my
publishers
and
lighting
one
of
my
cigars
from
a
bundle
of
brevas
in
front
of
him
took
off
his
coat
and
sat
down
to
peruse
the
statement
of
my
returns
simple
though
it
was
this
act
aroused
the
first
feeling
of
resentment
in
my
breast
for
the
relations
between
the
author
and
his
publishers
are
among
the
most
sacred
confidences
of
life
and
the
peeping
tom
who
peers
through
a
keyhole
at
the
courtship
of
a
young
man
engaged
in
wooing
his
fiancée
is
no
worse
an
intruder
than
he
who
would
tear
aside
the
veil
of
secrecy
which
screens
the
official
returns
of
a
best
seller
from
the
public
eye
feeling
therefore
that
i
had
permitted
matters
to
proceed
as
far
as
they
might
with
propriety
i
instantly
entered
the
room
and
confronted
my
uninvited
guest
bracing
myself
of
course
for
the
defensive
onslaught
which
i
naturally
expected
to
sustain
but
nothing
of
the
sort
occurred
for
the
intruder
with
a
composure
that
was
nothing
short
of
marvelous
under
the
circumstances
instead
of
rising
hurriedly
like
one
caught
in
some
disreputable
act
merely
leaned
farther
back
in
the
chair
took
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
greeted
me
with
howdy
do
sir
what
can
i
do
for
you
this
beastly
hot
night
the
cold
rim
of
a
placed
at
my
temple
could
not
more
effectually
have
put
me
out
of
business
than
this
nonchalant
reception
consequently
i
gasped
out
something
about
its
being
the
sultriest
of
august
in
eighteen
years
and
plumped
back
into
a
chair
opposite
him
i
would
mind
a
remsen
cooler
myself
he
went
on
but
the
fact
is
your
butler
is
off
for
and
i
hanged
if
i
can
find
a
lemon
in
the
house
maybe
you
join
me
in
a
smoke
he
added
shoving
my
own
bundle
of
brevas
across
the
table
help
yourself
i
guess
i
know
where
the
lemons
are
said
i
but
how
did
you
know
my
butler
was
out
i
telephoned
him
to
go
to
philadelphia
this
afternoon
to
see
his
brother
yoku
who
is
ill
there
said
my
visitor
you
see
i
did
want
him
around
when
i
called
i
knew
i
could
manage
you
alone
in
case
you
turned
up
as
you
see
you
have
but
two
of
you
and
one
a
jap
i
was
afraid
might
involve
us
all
in
ugly
complications
between
you
and
me
jenkins
these
orientals
are
pretty
lively
fighters
and
your
man
nogi
particularly
has
got
down
to
a
pretty
fine
point
so
i
had
to
do
something
to
get
rid
of
him
our
arrangement
is
a
matter
for
two
not
three
anyhow
so
said
i
coldly
you
and
i
have
an
arrangement
have
we
i
aware
of
it
not
yet
he
answered
but
there
a
chance
that
we
may
have
if
i
can
only
satisfy
myself
that
you
are
the
man
i
looking
for
there
is
no
earthly
reason
that
i
can
see
why
we
should
not
come
to
terms
go
on
out
and
get
the
lemons
and
the
gin
and
soda
and
let
talk
this
thing
over
man
to
man
like
a
couple
of
good
fellows
at
the
club
i
mean
you
no
harm
and
you
certainly
do
wish
to
do
any
kind
of
injury
to
a
chap
who
even
though
appearances
are
against
him
really
means
to
do
you
a
good
turn
appearances
certainly
are
against
you
sir
said
i
a
trifle
warmly
for
the
man
composure
was
irritating
a
disappearance
would
be
more
likely
to
do
you
credit
at
this
moment
tush
jenkins
he
answered
why
waste
breath
saying
things
here
you
are
on
the
verge
of
a
big
transaction
and
you
delay
proceedings
by
making
statements
of
fact
mixed
in
with
a
cheap
wit
which
i
must
confess
i
find
surprising
and
so
obvious
as
to
be
visible
even
to
the
blind
you
do
talk
like
an
author
whose
stuff
is
worth
ten
cents
a
word
more
like
a
in
fact
with
whom
words
are
of
such
small
value
that
no
one
the
loser
if
he
throws
away
a
whole
dictionary
go
out
and
mix
a
couple
of
your
best
remsen
coolers
and
by
the
time
you
get
back
i
have
got
to
the
gist
of
this
royalty
statement
of
yours
which
is
all
i
come
for
your
silver
and
books
and
love
letters
and
manuscripts
are
safe
from
me
i
would
have
as
a
gift
what
concern
have
you
with
my
royalties
i
demanded
a
vital
one
said
he
mix
the
coolers
and
when
you
get
back
i
tell
you
go
on
there
a
good
chap
it
be
daylight
before
long
and
i
want
to
close
up
this
job
if
i
can
before
sunrise
what
there
was
in
the
man
manner
to
persuade
me
to
compliance
with
his
wishes
i
am
sure
i
can
not
say
definitely
there
was
a
cold
steely
glitter
in
his
eye
for
one
thing
with
it
however
was
a
strengthfulness
of
purpose
a
certain
pleasant
masterfulness
that
made
me
feel
that
i
could
trust
him
and
it
was
to
this
aspect
of
his
nature
that
i
yielded
there
was
something
frankly
appealing
in
his
long
thin
ascetic
looking
face
and
i
found
it
irresistible
all
right
said
i
with
a
smile
and
a
frown
to
express
the
conflicting
quality
of
my
emotions
so
be
it
i
get
the
coolers
but
you
must
remember
my
friend
that
there
are
coolers
and
coolers
just
as
there
are
jugs
and
jugs
the
kind
of
jug
that
remains
for
you
will
depend
upon
the
story
you
have
to
tell
when
i
get
back
so
you
better
see
that
it
a
good
one
i
am
not
afraid
jenkins
old
chap
he
said
with
a
hearty
laugh
as
i
rose
if
this
royalty
statement
can
prove
to
me
that
you
are
the
literary
partner
i
need
in
my
business
i
can
prove
to
you
that
i
a
good
man
to
tie
up
to
so
go
along
with
you
with
this
he
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
turned
to
a
perusal
of
my
statement
which
i
am
glad
to
say
was
a
good
one
owing
to
the
great
success
of
my
book
animals
i
have
never
the
seller
at
rochester
watertown
and
miami
in
june
and
july
while
i
went
out
into
the
and
mixed
the
coolers
as
you
may
imagine
i
was
not
long
at
it
for
my
curiosity
over
my
visitor
lent
wings
to
my
corkscrew
and
in
five
minutes
i
was
back
with
the
tempting
beverages
in
the
tall
glasses
the
lemon
curl
giving
it
the
vertebrate
appearance
that
all
stiff
drinks
should
have
and
the
ice
tinkling
refreshingly
upon
the
sultry
air
there
said
i
placing
his
glass
before
him
drink
hearty
and
then
to
business
who
are
you
there
is
my
card
he
replied
swallowing
a
goodly
half
of
the
cooler
and
smacking
his
lips
appreciatively
and
tossing
a
visiting
card
across
to
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
i
picked
up
the
card
and
read
as
follows
raffles
holmes
london
and
new
york
raffles
holmes
i
cried
in
amazement
the
same
jenkins
said
he
i
am
the
son
of
sherlock
holmes
the
famous
detective
and
grandson
of
raffles
the
distinguished
er
ah
cricketer
sir
i
gazed
at
him
dumb
with
astonishment
you
heard
of
my
father
sherlock
holmes
asked
my
visitor
i
confessed
that
the
name
of
the
gentleman
was
not
unfamiliar
to
me
and
raffles
my
grandfather
he
persisted
if
there
ever
was
a
story
of
that
fascinating
man
that
i
have
not
read
holmes
said
i
i
beg
you
will
let
me
have
it
well
then
said
he
with
that
quick
nervous
manner
which
proved
him
a
true
son
of
sherlock
holmes
did
it
never
occur
to
you
as
an
extraordinary
happening
as
you
read
of
my
father
wonderful
powers
as
a
detective
and
of
raffles
equally
wonderful
prowess
as
a
er
well
let
us
not
mince
words
as
a
thief
jenkins
the
two
men
operating
in
england
at
the
same
time
that
no
story
ever
appeared
in
which
sherlock
holmes
genius
was
pitted
against
the
subtly
planned
misdeeds
of
raffles
is
it
not
surprising
that
with
two
such
men
as
they
were
working
out
their
destinies
in
almost
identical
grooves
of
daily
action
they
should
never
have
crossed
each
other
paths
as
far
as
the
public
is
the
wiser
and
in
the
very
nature
of
the
conflicting
interests
of
their
respective
lines
of
action
as
foemen
the
one
pursuing
the
other
pursued
they
should
to
the
public
knowledge
never
have
clashed
now
that
you
speak
of
it
said
i
it
was
rather
extraordinary
that
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
one
would
think
that
the
sufferers
from
the
depredations
of
raffles
would
immediately
have
gone
to
holmes
for
assistance
in
bringing
the
other
to
justice
truly
as
you
intimate
it
was
strange
that
they
never
did
pardon
me
jenkins
put
in
my
visitor
i
never
intimated
anything
of
the
sort
what
i
intimated
was
that
no
story
of
any
such
conflict
ever
came
to
light
as
a
matter
of
fact
sherlock
holmes
was
put
upon
a
raffles
case
in
and
while
success
attended
upon
every
step
of
it
and
my
grandfather
was
run
to
earth
by
him
as
easily
as
was
ever
any
other
criminal
in
grip
a
little
naked
god
called
cupid
stepped
in
saved
raffles
from
jail
and
wrote
the
word
failure
across
holmes
docket
of
the
case
sir
am
the
only
tangible
result
of
lord
dorrington
retainers
to
sherlock
you
speak
enigmatically
after
the
occasional
fashion
of
your
illustrious
father
said
i
the
dorrington
case
is
unfamiliar
to
me
naturally
so
said
my
because
save
to
my
father
my
grandfather
and
myself
the
details
are
unknown
to
anybody
not
even
my
mother
knew
of
the
incident
and
as
for
watson
and
bunny
the
scribes
through
whose
industry
the
adventures
of
those
two
great
men
were
respectively
narrated
to
an
absorbed
world
they
did
even
know
there
had
ever
been
a
dorrington
case
because
sherlock
holmes
never
told
watson
and
raffles
never
told
bunny
but
they
both
told
me
and
now
that
i
am
satisfied
that
there
is
a
demand
for
your
books
i
am
willing
to
tell
it
to
you
with
the
understanding
that
we
share
and
share
alike
in
the
profits
if
perchance
you
think
well
enough
of
it
to
write
it
up
go
on
i
said
i
whack
up
with
you
square
and
honest
which
is
more
than
either
watson
or
bunny
ever
did
with
my
father
or
my
grandfather
else
i
should
not
be
in
the
business
which
now
occupies
my
time
and
attention
said
raffles
holmes
with
a
cold
snap
to
his
eyes
which
i
took
as
an
admonition
to
hew
strictly
to
the
line
of
honor
or
to
subject
myself
to
terrible
consequences
with
that
understanding
jenkins
tell
you
the
story
of
the
dorrington
ruby
seal
in
which
some
crime
a
good
deal
of
romance
and
my
ancestry
are
involved
ii
the
adventure
of
the
dorrington
ruby
seal
lord
dorrington
as
you
may
have
heard
said
raffles
holmes
leaning
back
in
my
and
gazing
reflectively
up
at
the
ceiling
was
chiefly
famous
in
england
as
a
sporting
peer
his
vast
estates
in
five
counties
were
always
open
to
any
sportsman
of
renown
or
otherwise
as
long
as
he
was
a
true
sportsman
so
open
indeed
was
the
house
that
he
kept
that
whether
he
was
there
or
not
little
parties
of
members
of
the
sporting
fraternity
used
to
be
got
up
at
a
moment
notice
to
run
down
to
dorrington
castle
devonshire
to
dorrington
lodge
on
the
isle
of
wight
to
dorrington
hall
near
dublin
or
to
any
other
country
place
for
over
sunday
sometimes
there
be
a
lot
of
turf
people
sometimes
a
dozen
or
more
devotes
of
the
not
infrequently
a
gathering
of
the
cricketers
of
the
time
among
whom
of
course
my
grandfather
raffles
was
conspicuous
for
the
most
part
the
cricketers
never
partook
of
dorrington
hospitality
save
when
his
lordship
was
present
for
your
is
a
bit
more
punctilious
in
such
matters
than
your
turfmen
or
habitués
it
so
happened
one
year
however
that
his
lordship
was
absent
from
england
for
the
better
part
of
eight
months
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
annual
cricket
gathering
at
his
devonshire
place
he
cabled
his
london
representative
to
see
to
it
that
everything
was
carried
on
just
as
if
he
were
present
and
that
every
one
should
be
invited
for
the
usual
week
play
and
pleasure
at
dorrington
castle
his
instructions
were
carried
out
to
the
letter
and
save
for
the
fact
that
the
genial
host
was
absent
the
went
through
to
perfection
my
grandfather
as
usual
was
the
life
of
the
occasion
and
all
went
merry
as
a
seven
months
later
lord
dorrington
returned
and
a
week
after
that
the
loss
of
the
dorrington
jewels
from
the
devonshire
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
when
or
by
whom
they
had
been
taken
was
an
absolute
mystery
as
far
as
anybody
could
find
out
they
might
have
been
taken
the
night
before
his
return
or
the
night
after
his
departure
the
only
fact
in
sight
was
that
they
were
gone
lady
dorrington
diamonds
a
valuable
jewelled
rings
belonging
to
his
lordship
and
most
irremediable
of
losses
the
famous
ruby
seal
which
george
iv
had
given
to
grandfather
sir
arthur
deering
as
a
token
of
his
personal
esteem
during
the
period
of
the
regency
this
was
a
flawless
ruby
valued
at
some
six
or
seven
thousand
pounds
sterling
in
which
had
been
cut
the
deering
arms
surrounded
by
a
garter
upon
which
were
engraved
the
words
ton
which
the
family
upon
sir
arthur
elevation
to
the
peerage
in
took
as
its
title
or
dorrington
his
lordship
was
almost
prostrated
by
the
loss
the
diamonds
and
the
rings
although
valued
at
thirty
thousand
pounds
he
could
easily
replace
but
the
personal
associations
of
the
seal
were
such
that
nothing
no
amount
of
money
could
duplicate
the
lost
ruby
so
that
his
first
act
i
broke
in
breathlessly
was
to
send
for
sherlock
holmes
my
father
said
raffles
holmes
yes
jenkins
the
first
thing
lord
dorrington
did
was
to
telegraph
to
london
for
sherlock
holmes
requesting
him
to
come
immediately
to
dorrington
castle
and
assume
charge
of
the
case
needless
to
say
holmes
dropped
everything
else
and
came
he
inspected
the
gardens
measured
the
road
from
the
railway
station
to
the
castle
questioned
all
the
servants
was
particularly
insistent
upon
knowing
where
the
was
on
the
of
january
secured
accurate
information
as
to
the
personal
habits
of
his
lordship
dachshund
nicholas
subjected
the
chef
to
a
that
covered
every
point
of
his
life
from
his
remote
ancestry
to
his
receipt
for
baking
apples
gathered
up
three
of
sweeping
from
his
lordship
private
apartment
and
two
boxes
containing
three
each
of
every
variety
of
cigars
that
lord
dorrington
had
laid
down
in
his
cellar
as
you
are
aware
sherlock
holmes
in
his
prime
was
a
great
master
of
detail
he
then
departed
for
london
taking
with
him
an
impression
in
wax
of
the
missing
seal
which
lord
dorrington
happened
to
have
preserved
in
his
escritoire
on
his
return
to
london
holmes
inspected
the
seal
carefully
under
a
and
was
instantly
impressed
with
the
fact
that
it
was
not
unfamiliar
to
him
he
had
seen
it
somewhere
before
but
where
that
was
now
the
question
in
his
mind
prior
to
this
he
had
never
had
any
communication
with
lord
dorrington
so
that
if
it
was
in
his
correspondence
that
the
seal
had
formerly
come
to
him
most
assuredly
the
person
who
had
used
it
had
come
by
it
dishonestly
fortunately
at
that
time
it
was
a
habit
of
my
father
never
to
destroy
papers
of
any
sort
every
letter
that
he
ever
received
was
classified
and
filed
envelope
and
all
the
thing
to
do
then
was
manifestly
to
run
over
the
files
and
find
the
letter
if
indeed
it
was
in
or
on
a
letter
that
the
seal
had
first
come
to
his
attention
it
was
a
herculean
job
but
that
never
feazed
sherlock
holmes
and
he
went
at
it
tooth
and
nail
finally
his
effort
was
rewarded
under
for
autograph
he
found
a
little
missive
from
a
young
girl
living
at
on
the
thames
the
daughter
she
said
of
a
retired
missionary
the
reverend
james
tattersby
asking
him
if
he
would
not
kindly
write
his
autograph
upon
the
enclosed
slip
for
her
collection
it
was
the
regular
stock
application
that
truly
distinguished
men
receive
in
every
mail
the
only
thing
to
distinguish
it
from
other
applications
was
the
beauty
of
the
seal
on
the
fly
of
the
envelope
which
attracted
his
passing
notice
and
was
then
filed
away
with
the
other
letters
of
similar
import
ho
quoth
holmes
as
he
compared
the
two
impressions
and
discovered
that
they
were
identical
innocent
little
maiden
who
collects
autographs
and
a
retired
missionary
in
possession
of
the
dorrington
seal
eh
well
that
interesting
i
think
i
shall
run
down
to
streatley
over
sunday
and
meets
miss
marjorie
tattersby
and
her
reverend
father
i
like
to
see
to
what
style
of
people
i
have
intrusted
my
autograph
to
decide
was
to
act
with
sherlock
holmes
and
the
following
saturday
hiring
a
canoe
at
windsor
he
made
his
way
up
the
river
until
he
came
to
the
pretty
little
hamlet
snuggling
in
the
thames
valley
if
such
it
may
be
called
where
the
young
lady
and
her
good
father
were
dwelling
fortune
favored
him
in
that
his
prey
was
still
there
both
much
respected
by
the
whole
community
the
father
a
fine
looking
really
splendid
specimen
of
a
man
whose
presence
alone
carried
a
conviction
of
integrity
and
a
lofty
man
the
daughter
well
to
see
her
was
to
love
her
and
the
moment
the
eyes
of
sherlock
fell
upon
her
face
that
great
heart
of
his
that
had
ever
been
adamant
to
beauty
a
very
gibraltar
against
the
wiles
of
the
other
sex
went
down
in
the
chaos
of
a
first
and
overwhelming
passion
so
hard
hit
was
he
by
miss
tattersby
beauty
that
his
chief
thought
now
was
to
avert
rather
than
to
direct
suspicion
towards
her
after
all
she
might
have
come
into
possession
of
the
jewel
honestly
though
how
the
daughter
of
a
retired
missionary
considering
its
intrinsic
value
could
manage
such
a
thing
was
pretty
hard
to
understand
and
he
fled
back
to
london
to
think
it
over
arrived
there
he
found
an
invitation
to
visit
dorrington
castle
again
incog
lord
dorrington
was
to
have
a
mixed
party
over
the
following
sunday
and
this
he
thought
would
give
holmes
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
characteristics
of
dorrington
visitors
and
possibly
gain
therefore
some
clew
as
to
the
person
from
whose
depredations
his
lordship
had
suffered
the
idea
commended
itself
to
holmes
and
in
the
disguise
of
a
young
american
clergyman
whom
dorrington
had
met
in
the
states
the
following
friday
found
him
at
dorrington
castle
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
said
raffles
holmes
the
young
clergyman
was
introduced
to
many
of
the
leading
sportsmen
of
the
hour
and
for
the
most
part
they
passed
muster
but
one
of
them
did
not
and
that
was
the
cricketer
raffles
for
the
moment
raffles
entered
the
room
jovially
greeting
everybody
about
him
and
was
presented
to
lord
dorrington
new
guest
sherlock
holmes
recognized
in
him
no
less
a
person
that
the
reverend
james
tattersby
retired
missionary
of
and
the
father
of
the
woman
who
had
filled
his
soul
with
love
and
yearning
of
the
truest
sort
the
problem
was
solved
raffles
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
caught
with
the
goods
on
holmes
could
have
exposed
him
then
and
there
had
he
chosen
to
do
so
but
every
time
it
came
to
the
point
the
lovely
face
of
marjorie
tattersby
came
between
him
and
his
purpose
how
could
he
inflict
the
pain
and
shame
which
the
exposure
of
her
father
misconduct
would
certainly
entail
upon
that
fair
woman
whose
beauty
and
fresh
innocence
had
taken
so
strong
a
hold
upon
his
heart
no
that
was
out
of
the
question
the
thing
to
do
clearly
was
to
visit
miss
tattersby
during
her
father
absence
and
if
possible
ascertain
from
just
how
she
had
come
into
possession
of
the
seal
before
taking
further
steps
in
the
matter
this
he
did
making
sure
to
begin
with
that
raffles
was
to
remain
at
dorrington
hall
for
the
coming
ten
days
holmes
had
himself
telegraphed
for
and
returned
to
london
there
he
wrote
himself
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
reverend
james
tattersby
on
the
paper
of
the
american
missionary
society
a
sheet
of
which
he
secured
in
the
public
of
that
institution
armed
with
which
he
returned
to
the
beautiful
little
spot
on
the
thames
where
the
tattersbys
abode
he
spent
the
night
at
the
inn
and
in
conversation
with
the
landlord
and
boatmen
learned
much
that
was
interesting
concerning
the
reverend
james
among
other
things
he
discovered
that
this
gentleman
and
his
daughter
had
been
respected
residents
of
the
place
for
three
years
that
tattersby
was
rarely
seen
in
the
daytime
about
the
place
that
he
was
unusually
fond
of
canoeing
at
night
which
he
said
gave
him
the
quiet
and
solitude
necessary
for
that
reflection
which
is
so
essential
to
the
spiritual
being
of
a
minister
of
grace
that
he
frequently
indulged
in
long
absences
during
which
time
it
was
supposed
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
work
of
his
calling
he
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
some
but
not
lavish
means
the
most
notable
and
suggestive
thing
however
that
holmes
ascertained
in
his
conversation
with
the
boatmen
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
famous
cliveden
robbery
when
several
thousand
pounds
worth
of
plate
had
been
taken
from
the
great
hall
that
later
fell
into
the
possession
of
a
american
tattersby
who
happened
to
be
on
the
river
late
that
night
was
according
to
his
own
statement
the
unconscious
witness
of
the
escape
of
the
thieves
on
board
a
mysterious
which
the
police
were
never
able
afterwards
to
locate
they
had
nearly
upset
his
canoe
with
the
wash
of
their
rapidly
moving
craft
as
they
sped
past
him
after
having
stowed
their
loot
safely
on
board
tattersby
had
supposed
them
to
be
employés
of
the
estate
and
never
gave
the
matter
another
thought
until
three
days
later
when
the
news
of
the
robbery
was
published
to
the
world
he
had
immediately
communicated
the
news
of
what
he
had
seen
to
the
police
and
had
done
all
that
lay
in
his
power
to
aid
them
in
locating
the
robbers
but
all
to
no
purpose
from
that
day
to
this
the
mystery
of
the
cliveden
plot
had
never
been
solved
the
following
day
holmes
called
at
the
tattersby
cottage
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
miss
tattersby
at
home
his
previous
impression
as
to
her
marvellous
beauty
was
more
than
confirmed
and
each
moment
that
he
talked
to
her
she
revealed
new
graces
of
manner
that
completed
the
capture
of
his
hitherto
unsusceptible
heart
miss
tattersby
regretted
her
father
absence
he
had
gone
she
said
to
attend
a
secret
missionary
conference
at
pentwllycod
in
wales
and
was
not
expected
back
for
a
week
all
of
which
quite
suited
sherlock
holmes
convinced
that
after
years
of
waiting
his
affinity
had
at
last
crossed
his
path
he
was
in
no
hurry
for
the
return
of
that
parent
who
would
put
an
instant
quietus
upon
this
affair
of
the
heart
manifestly
the
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
win
the
daughter
hand
and
then
intercept
the
father
acquaint
him
with
his
aspirations
and
compel
acquiescence
by
the
force
of
his
knowledge
of
raffles
misdeed
hence
instead
of
taking
his
departure
immediately
he
remained
at
the
streatley
inn
taking
care
each
day
to
encounter
miss
tattersby
on
one
pretext
or
another
hoping
that
their
acquaintance
would
ripen
into
friendship
and
then
into
something
warmer
nor
was
the
hope
a
vain
one
for
when
the
fair
marjorie
learned
that
it
was
the
visitor
intention
to
remain
in
the
neighborhood
until
her
father
return
she
herself
bade
him
to
make
use
of
the
old
gentleman
library
to
regard
himself
always
as
a
welcome
daytime
guest
she
even
suggested
pleasant
walks
through
the
neighboring
country
little
canoe
trips
up
and
down
the
thames
which
they
might
take
together
of
all
of
which
holmes
promptly
availed
himself
with
the
result
that
at
the
end
of
six
days
both
realized
that
they
were
designed
for
each
other
and
a
passionate
declaration
followed
which
opened
new
vistas
of
happiness
for
both
hence
it
was
that
when
the
reverend
james
tattersby
arrived
at
the
following
monday
night
unexpectedly
he
was
astounded
to
find
sitting
together
in
the
moonlight
in
the
charming
little
english
garden
at
the
rear
of
his
dwelling
two
persons
one
of
whom
was
his
daughter
marjorie
and
the
other
a
young
american
curate
to
whom
he
had
already
been
introduced
as
raffles
have
met
before
i
think
said
raffles
coldly
as
his
eye
fell
upon
holmes
er
do
not
recall
the
fact
replied
holmes
meeting
the
steely
stare
of
the
with
one
of
his
own
flinty
glances
ejaculated
raffles
at
the
other
failure
to
recognize
him
then
he
shivered
slightly
we
go
it
is
a
trifle
chilly
out
here
in
the
night
air
the
whole
thing
the
greeting
the
meeting
holmes
demeanor
and
all
was
so
admirably
handled
that
marjorie
tattersby
never
guessed
the
truth
never
even
suspected
the
intense
dramatic
quality
of
the
scene
she
had
just
gazed
upon
let
us
go
she
acquiesced
dutton
has
something
to
say
to
you
papa
i
presumed
said
raffles
dryly
something
that
were
better
said
to
me
alone
i
fancy
eh
he
added
so
said
holmes
calmly
and
they
went
marjorie
immediately
retired
to
the
and
holmes
and
raffles
went
at
once
to
tattersby
study
said
raffles
impatiently
when
they
were
seated
suppose
you
have
come
to
get
the
dorrington
seal
mr
holmes
you
know
me
then
mr
raffles
said
holmes
with
a
pleasant
smile
said
raffles
knew
you
at
dorrington
hall
the
moment
i
set
eyes
on
you
and
if
i
had
i
should
have
known
later
for
the
night
after
your
departure
lord
dorrington
took
me
into
his
confidence
and
revealed
your
identity
to
me
am
glad
said
holmes
saves
me
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
explanation
if
you
admit
that
you
have
the
seal
i
do
said
raffles
mentioned
it
a
moment
ago
because
dorrington
told
me
that
was
what
you
were
after
i
have
got
it
mr
holmes
know
that
observed
holmes
quietly
is
in
the
possession
of
miss
tattersby
your
daughter
mr
raffles
showed
it
to
you
eh
demanded
raffles
paling
she
sealed
a
note
to
me
with
it
however
holmes
replied
note
to
you
cried
raffles
one
asking
for
my
autograph
i
have
it
in
my
possession
said
holmes
how
do
you
know
that
she
is
the
person
from
whom
that
note
really
came
raffles
asked
i
have
seen
the
autograph
which
was
sent
in
response
to
that
request
in
your
daughter
collection
raffles
said
holmes
that
you
conclude
raffles
put
in
hoarsely
do
not
conclude
i
begin
by
surmising
sir
that
the
missing
seal
of
lord
dorrington
was
stolen
by
one
of
two
persons
yourself
or
miss
marjorie
tattersby
said
holmes
calmly
roared
raffles
springing
to
his
feet
menacingly
down
please
said
holmes
did
not
let
me
finish
i
was
going
to
add
tattersby
that
a
week
acquaintance
with
that
lovely
woman
a
full
knowledge
of
her
peculiarly
exalted
character
and
guileless
nature
makes
the
alternative
of
guilt
that
affects
her
integrity
clearly
preposterous
which
by
a
very
simple
process
of
elimination
fastens
the
guilt
beyond
all
peradventure
on
your
shoulders
at
any
rate
the
presence
of
the
seal
in
this
house
will
involve
you
in
difficult
explanations
why
is
it
here
how
did
it
come
here
why
are
you
known
as
the
reverend
james
tattersby
the
missionary
at
and
as
raffles
the
cricketer
and
man
of
the
world
at
dorrington
hall
to
say
nothing
of
the
cliveden
plate
roared
the
reverend
james
tattersby
again
springing
to
his
feet
and
glancing
instinctively
at
the
long
low
behind
him
say
nothing
continued
holmes
calmly
lighting
a
cigarette
the
cliveden
plate
now
lying
concealed
behind
those
dusty
theological
tomes
of
yours
which
you
never
allow
to
be
touched
by
any
other
hand
than
your
own
did
you
know
cried
raffles
hoarsely
did
laughed
holmes
have
only
this
moment
informed
me
of
the
fact
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
raffles
paced
the
floor
like
a
caged
tiger
a
dangerous
man
to
trifle
with
holmes
he
said
finally
can
shoot
you
down
in
cold
blood
in
a
second
likely
said
holmes
you
wo
it
would
add
to
the
difficulties
in
which
the
reverend
james
tattersby
is
already
deeply
immersed
your
troubles
are
sufficient
as
matters
stand
without
your
having
to
explain
to
the
world
why
you
have
killed
a
defenceless
guest
in
your
own
study
in
cold
blood
what
do
you
propose
to
do
demanded
raffles
after
another
pause
your
daughter
raffles
or
tattersby
whatever
your
permanent
name
is
i
guess
it
tattersby
in
this
case
said
holmes
love
her
and
she
loves
me
perhaps
i
should
apologize
for
having
wooed
and
won
her
without
due
notice
to
you
but
you
doubtless
will
forgive
that
it
a
little
formality
you
sometimes
overlook
yourself
when
you
happen
to
want
something
that
belongs
to
somebody
else
what
raffles
would
have
answered
no
one
knows
he
had
no
chance
to
reply
for
at
that
moment
marjorie
herself
put
her
radiantly
lovely
little
head
in
at
the
door
with
a
i
come
in
and
a
moment
later
she
was
gathered
in
holmes
arms
and
the
happy
lovers
received
the
reverend
james
blessing
they
were
married
a
week
later
and
as
far
as
the
world
is
concerned
the
mystery
of
the
dorrington
seal
and
that
of
the
cliveden
plate
was
never
solved
is
compounding
a
felony
raffles
said
holmes
after
the
wedding
for
a
wife
like
that
hanged
if
i
would
compound
the
ten
commandments
i
hope
i
ventured
to
put
in
at
that
point
that
the
marriage
ceremony
was
not
performed
by
the
reverend
james
tattersby
not
on
your
life
retorted
raffles
holmes
my
father
was
too
fond
of
my
mother
to
permit
of
any
flaw
in
his
title
a
year
later
i
was
born
and
well
here
i
am
son
of
one
grandson
of
the
other
with
hereditary
traits
from
both
strongly
developed
and
ready
for
business
i
want
a
literary
partner
a
man
who
will
write
me
up
as
bunny
did
raffles
and
watson
did
holmes
so
that
i
may
get
a
percentage
on
that
part
of
the
swag
i
offer
you
the
job
jenkins
those
royalty
statements
show
me
that
you
are
the
man
and
your
books
prove
to
me
that
you
need
a
few
fresh
ideas
come
what
do
you
say
will
you
do
it
my
boy
said
i
enthusiastically
do
say
another
word
will
i
well
just
try
me
and
so
it
was
that
raffles
holmes
and
i
struck
a
bargain
and
became
partners
iii
the
adventure
of
burlingame
diamond
stomacher
i
had
seen
the
marvellous
creation
very
often
at
the
opera
and
in
many
ways
resented
it
not
that
i
was
in
the
least
degree
a
victim
to
envy
hatred
and
malice
towards
those
who
are
possessed
of
a
superabundance
of
this
world
good
things
far
from
it
i
rejoice
in
the
great
fortunes
of
earth
because
with
every
dollar
corralled
by
the
superior
energies
of
the
millionaires
the
fewer
there
are
for
other
men
to
seek
and
until
we
stop
seeking
dollars
and
turn
our
minds
to
other
finer
things
there
will
be
no
hope
of
peace
and
sweet
content
upon
this
little
green
ball
we
inhabit
my
resentment
of
burlingame
diamond
stomacher
was
not
then
based
on
envy
of
its
possession
but
merely
upon
the
twofold
nuisance
which
it
created
at
the
as
the
lady
who
wore
it
sat
and
listened
to
the
strains
of
wagner
bizet
or
gounod
mixed
in
with
the
of
reggie
stockson
tommie
de
coupon
and
other
lights
of
the
social
firmament
in
the
first
place
it
caused
the
people
sitting
about
me
in
the
high
seats
of
the
house
to
chatter
about
it
and
discuss
its
probable
worth
every
time
the
lady
made
her
appearance
in
it
and
i
had
fled
from
the
standee
part
of
the
house
to
the
top
gallery
just
to
escape
the
talkers
and
if
possible
to
get
my
music
straight
without
interruptions
of
any
sort
whatsoever
on
the
side
in
the
second
place
the
confounded
thing
glittered
so
that
from
where
i
sat
it
was
as
dazzling
as
so
many
small
mirrors
flashing
in
the
light
of
the
sun
it
seemed
as
if
every
electric
light
in
the
house
found
some
kind
of
a
refractor
in
the
thousands
of
gems
of
which
it
was
composed
and
many
of
the
brilliant
light
effects
of
the
stage
were
dimmed
in
their
lustre
by
the
persistent
intrusion
of
burlingame
glory
upon
my
line
of
vision
hence
in
was
that
when
i
picked
up
my
morning
paper
and
read
in
great
flaring
on
the
front
page
that
burlingame
diamond
stomacher
had
been
stolen
from
her
at
her
onyx
cottage
at
newport
i
smiled
broadly
and
slapped
the
so
hard
in
my
satisfaction
that
even
the
biscuits
flew
up
into
the
air
and
caught
in
the
chandelier
thank
heaven
for
that
i
said
next
season
i
shall
be
able
to
enjoy
my
opera
undisturbed
i
little
thought
at
that
blissful
moment
how
closely
indeed
were
my
own
fortunes
to
be
connected
with
that
wonderful
specimen
of
the
handicraft
but
an
hour
later
i
was
made
aware
of
the
first
link
in
the
chain
that
in
a
measure
bound
me
to
it
breakfast
over
i
went
to
my
desk
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
a
novel
i
had
written
the
week
before
when
word
came
up
on
the
telephone
from
below
that
a
gentleman
from
wished
to
see
me
on
an
important
matter
of
business
tell
him
i
already
a
subscriber
i
called
down
supposing
the
visitor
to
be
merely
an
agent
i
took
the
magazine
and
a
set
of
chaucer
in
a
revolving
bookcase
from
one
of
their
agents
last
month
and
have
paid
my
dollar
in
a
moment
another
message
came
over
the
wire
the
gentleman
says
he
wants
to
see
you
about
writing
a
couple
of
sonnets
for
the
christmas
number
the
office
man
up
show
him
up
i
replied
instantly
two
minutes
later
a
rather
handsome
man
with
a
fine
eye
and
a
long
flowing
gray
beard
was
ushered
into
my
apartment
i
am
stikes
of
jenkins
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
we
thought
you
might
like
to
contribute
to
our
christmas
issue
we
want
two
sonnets
one
on
the
old
christmas
and
the
other
on
the
new
we
ca
offer
you
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
apiece
for
them
but
something
caught
in
my
throat
but
i
managed
to
reply
i
might
shade
my
terms
a
trifle
since
you
want
as
many
as
two
i
gurgled
and
i
assume
you
will
pay
on
acceptance
certainly
he
said
gravely
could
you
let
me
have
them
say
this
afternoon
i
turned
away
so
that
he
would
not
see
the
expression
of
joy
on
my
face
and
then
there
came
from
behind
me
a
deep
chuckle
and
the
observation
in
a
familiar
voice
you
might
throw
in
a
couple
of
those
remsen
coolers
too
while
about
it
jenkins
i
whirled
about
as
if
struck
and
there
in
place
of
the
editor
stood
raffles
holmes
bully
disguise
eh
he
said
folding
up
his
beard
and
putting
it
in
his
pocket
said
i
ruefully
as
i
thought
of
the
vanished
two
thousand
i
think
i
preferred
you
in
disguise
though
old
man
i
added
you
wo
when
you
hear
what
i
come
for
said
he
there
apiece
in
this
job
for
us
to
what
job
do
you
refer
i
asked
the
burlingame
case
he
replied
i
suppose
you
read
in
the
papers
this
morning
how
burlingame
diamond
stomacher
has
turned
up
missing
yes
said
i
and
i
glad
of
it
you
ought
to
be
said
holmes
since
it
will
put
in
your
pocket
you
have
heard
yet
that
there
is
a
reward
of
offered
for
its
recovery
the
public
announcement
has
not
yet
been
made
but
it
will
be
in
papers
and
we
are
the
chaps
that
are
going
to
get
the
reward
but
how
i
demanded
leave
that
to
me
said
he
i
wish
you
let
me
leave
this
of
mine
in
your
room
for
about
ten
days
it
holds
some
important
papers
and
my
shop
is
turned
just
now
with
the
painters
very
well
said
i
i
shove
it
under
my
bed
i
took
the
as
holmes
had
requested
and
hid
it
away
in
my
bedroom
immediately
returning
to
the
library
where
he
sat
smoking
one
of
my
cigars
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
there
was
something
in
his
eye
however
that
aroused
my
suspicion
as
soon
as
i
entered
see
here
holmes
said
i
i
ca
afford
to
be
mixed
up
in
any
shady
business
like
this
you
know
have
you
got
that
stomacher
no
i
have
said
he
honor
bright
i
have
i
eyed
him
narrowly
i
think
i
understand
the
evasion
i
went
on
have
got
it
because
i
have
got
it
it
in
that
under
my
bed
open
it
and
see
for
yourself
said
he
it
is
there
but
you
know
where
it
is
i
demanded
how
else
could
i
be
sure
of
that
reward
he
asked
where
is
it
i
demanded
it
er
it
is
located
yet
that
is
not
finally
said
he
and
it
be
for
ten
days
ten
days
from
now
burlingame
will
find
it
herself
and
we
divvy
on
the
reward
my
boy
and
not
a
trace
of
dishonesty
in
the
whole
business
and
with
that
raffles
holmes
filled
his
pockets
with
cigars
from
my
stores
and
bidding
me
be
patient
went
his
way
the
effect
of
his
visit
upon
my
nerves
was
such
that
any
more
work
that
day
was
impossible
the
fear
of
possible
complications
to
follow
upset
me
wholly
and
despite
his
assurance
that
the
was
innocent
of
surreptitiously
acquired
stomachers
i
could
not
rid
my
mind
of
the
suspicion
that
he
made
of
my
apartment
a
fence
for
the
concealment
of
his
booty
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
was
i
inclined
to
send
for
him
and
request
him
to
remove
the
bag
forthwith
and
yet
if
it
should
so
happen
that
he
had
spoken
the
truth
i
should
by
that
act
endanger
our
friendship
and
possibly
break
the
pact
which
bade
fair
to
be
profitable
suddenly
i
remembered
his
injunction
to
me
to
look
for
myself
and
see
if
the
stomacher
really
was
concealed
there
and
i
hastened
to
act
upon
it
it
might
have
been
pure
bluff
on
his
part
and
i
resolved
not
to
be
bluffed
the
case
opened
easily
and
the
moment
i
glanced
into
it
my
suspicions
were
allayed
it
contained
nothing
but
bundle
after
bundle
of
letters
tied
together
with
pink
and
blue
ribbons
one
or
two
old
daguerreotypes
some
locks
of
hair
and
an
ivory
miniature
of
raffles
holmes
himself
as
an
infant
not
a
stomacher
diamond
or
otherwise
was
hid
in
the
case
nor
any
other
suspicious
object
and
i
closed
it
with
a
sheepish
feeling
of
shame
for
having
intruded
upon
the
sacred
correspondence
and
relics
of
the
happy
childhood
days
of
my
new
friend
that
night
as
holmes
had
asserted
a
reward
of
was
offered
for
the
recovery
of
the
burlingame
stomacher
and
the
newspapers
for
the
next
ten
days
were
full
of
the
theories
of
detectives
of
all
sorts
amateur
professional
and
reportorial
central
office
was
after
it
in
one
place
others
sought
it
elsewhere
the
editor
of
one
new
york
paper
printed
a
full
list
of
the
names
of
the
guests
at
burlingame
dinner
the
night
the
treasure
was
stolen
and
whether
they
ever
discovered
it
for
themselves
or
not
several
bearers
of
highly
honored
social
names
were
shadowed
by
reporters
and
others
everywhere
they
went
for
the
next
week
at
the
end
of
five
days
the
reward
was
increased
to
and
then
raffles
name
began
to
appear
in
connection
with
the
case
burlingame
herself
had
sent
for
him
and
without
taking
it
out
of
the
hands
of
others
had
personally
requested
him
to
look
into
the
matter
he
had
gone
to
newport
and
looked
the
situation
over
there
he
had
questioned
all
the
servants
in
her
two
establishments
at
newport
and
new
york
and
had
finally
assured
the
lady
that
on
the
following
tuesday
morning
he
would
advise
her
by
wire
of
the
definite
location
of
her
missing
jewel
during
all
this
time
holmes
had
not
communicated
with
me
at
all
and
i
began
to
fear
that
offended
by
my
behavior
at
our
last
meeting
he
had
cut
me
out
of
his
calculations
altogether
when
just
as
i
was
about
to
retire
on
sunday
night
he
reappeared
as
he
had
first
come
to
me
stealing
up
the
and
this
time
he
wore
a
mask
and
carried
unquestionably
a
burglar
kit
and
a
dark
lantern
he
started
nervously
as
he
caught
sight
of
me
reaching
up
to
turn
off
the
light
in
the
library
hang
it
call
jenkins
he
cried
i
thought
you
gone
off
to
the
country
for
the
no
said
i
i
meant
to
go
but
i
was
detained
what
up
oh
well
i
may
as
well
out
with
it
he
answered
i
did
want
you
to
know
but
well
watch
and
see
with
this
raffles
holmes
strode
directly
to
my
bookcase
removed
my
illustrated
set
of
fox
of
martyrs
in
five
volumes
from
the
shelves
and
there
resting
upon
the
shelf
behind
them
glittered
nothing
less
than
the
missing
stomacher
great
heavens
holmes
i
said
what
does
this
mean
how
did
those
diamonds
get
there
i
put
them
there
myself
while
you
were
shoving
my
under
your
bed
the
other
night
said
he
you
told
me
you
did
have
them
i
said
reproachfully
i
did
when
i
spoke
had
them
said
he
you
told
me
they
had
not
been
finally
located
i
persisted
angrily
i
told
you
the
truth
they
were
only
temporarily
located
he
answered
i
going
to
locate
them
definitely
and
burlingame
will
find
them
where
i
cried
her
own
safe
in
her
new
york
house
said
raffles
holmes
you
yes
i
took
them
from
newport
myself
very
easy
job
too
said
raffles
holmes
ever
since
i
saw
them
at
the
opera
last
winter
i
have
had
this
in
mind
so
when
burlingame
gave
her
dinner
i
served
as
an
extra
butler
from
delmonico
drugged
the
regular
chap
up
on
the
train
on
his
way
up
from
new
york
took
his
clothes
and
went
in
his
place
that
night
i
rifled
the
newport
safe
of
the
stomacher
and
the
next
day
brought
it
here
night
i
take
it
to
the
burlingame
house
on
fifth
avenue
secure
entrance
through
a
basement
door
to
which
in
my
capacity
of
detective
i
have
obtained
the
key
and
while
the
caretakers
sleep
burlingame
diamond
stomacher
will
be
placed
in
the
safe
on
the
first
floor
back
morning
i
shall
send
burlingame
this
message
you
looked
in
your
new
york
safe
signed
raffles
holmes
he
continued
she
will
come
to
town
by
the
first
train
to
find
out
what
i
mean
we
will
go
to
her
residence
she
will
open
the
safe
and
for
us
by
jove
holmes
you
are
a
wonder
said
i
this
stomacher
is
worth
at
the
least
i
added
as
i
took
the
creation
in
my
hand
pot
of
money
that
yes
said
he
with
a
sigh
taking
the
stomacher
from
me
and
fondling
it
the
raffles
in
me
tells
me
that
but
the
sherlock
holmes
in
my
veins
well
i
ca
keep
it
jenkins
if
that
is
what
you
mean
i
blushed
at
the
intimation
conveyed
by
his
words
and
was
silent
and
holmes
gathering
up
his
tools
and
stuffing
the
stomacher
in
the
capacious
bosom
of
his
coat
bade
me
au
revoir
and
went
out
into
the
night
the
rest
is
already
public
property
all
the
morning
papers
were
full
of
the
strange
recovery
of
the
burlingame
stomacher
the
following
tuesday
morning
and
the
name
of
raffles
holmes
was
in
every
mouth
that
night
the
very
essence
of
promptitude
holmes
appeared
at
my
apartment
and
handed
me
a
check
for
my
share
in
the
transaction
why
what
does
this
mean
i
cried
as
i
took
in
the
figures
i
thought
it
was
to
be
only
it
was
said
raffles
holmes
but
burlingame
was
so
overjoyed
at
getting
the
thing
back
she
made
the
check
for
instead
of
for
you
the
soul
of
honor
holmes
i
murmured
on
my
father
side
he
said
with
a
sigh
on
my
mother
side
it
comes
hard
and
burlingame
did
she
ask
you
how
you
ferreted
the
thing
out
i
asked
yes
said
holmes
but
i
told
her
that
that
was
my
secret
that
my
secret
was
my
profession
and
that
my
profession
was
my
bread
and
butter
but
she
must
have
asked
you
who
was
the
guilty
person
i
persisted
yes
said
holmes
she
did
and
i
took
her
for
a
little
gallop
through
the
social
register
in
search
of
the
guilty
party
that
got
on
her
nerves
so
that
when
it
came
down
to
an
absolute
question
of
identity
she
begged
me
to
forget
it
i
am
dull
of
comprehension
raffles
said
i
tell
me
exactly
what
you
mean
simply
this
said
raffles
holmes
the
present
four
hundred
consists
of
about
people
of
whom
about
per
cent
go
to
newport
at
one
time
or
another
say
of
these
about
ten
per
cent
are
eligible
for
invitations
to
the
burlingame
dinners
or
now
whom
of
the
possibilities
having
access
to
the
burlingame
cottage
would
we
naturally
suspect
surely
only
those
who
were
in
the
vicinity
the
night
of
the
robbery
by
a
process
of
elimination
we
narrowed
them
down
to
just
ten
persons
exclusive
of
burlingame
herself
and
her
husband
old
billie
burlingame
we
took
the
lot
and
canvassed
them
there
were
and
willington
bodfish
they
left
early
and
the
stomacher
was
known
to
be
safe
at
the
time
of
their
departure
there
were
bishop
and
pounderby
neither
of
whom
would
be
at
all
likely
to
come
back
in
the
dead
of
night
and
remove
property
that
did
not
belong
to
them
there
were
senator
and
jorrocks
the
senator
is
after
bigger
game
than
diamond
stomachers
and
jorrocks
is
known
to
be
honest
there
were
harry
gaddsby
and
his
wife
harry
does
know
enough
to
go
in
when
it
rains
and
is
too
timid
to
call
even
his
soul
his
own
so
he
could
have
taken
it
and
gaddsby
is
long
on
stomachers
having
at
least
five
and
therefore
would
not
be
likely
to
try
to
land
a
sixth
by
questionable
means
in
that
way
we
practically
cleared
eight
possibilities
of
suspicion
burlingame
said
i
leaves
four
persons
still
in
the
ring
yourself
your
husband
your
daughter
and
the
duke
of
snarleyow
your
daughter
newly
acquired
fiancé
in
whose
honor
the
dinner
was
given
of
these
four
you
are
naturally
yourself
the
first
to
be
acquitted
your
husband
comes
next
and
is
not
likely
to
be
the
guilty
party
because
if
he
wants
a
diamond
stomacher
he
need
steal
it
having
money
enough
to
buy
a
dozen
of
them
if
he
wishes
the
third
your
daughter
should
be
regarded
as
equally
innocent
because
if
she
was
really
desirous
of
possessing
the
jewel
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
borrow
it
from
you
that
brings
us
down
to
the
duke
of
i
beg
of
you
raffles
holmes
she
cried
in
great
agitation
another
word
i
beseech
you
if
any
one
should
overhear
us
the
subject
after
all
is
an
unprofitable
one
and
i
i
rather
drop
it
and
it
it
er
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
possibly
i
er
possibly
i
the
jewel
in
the
safe
yourself
i
suggested
said
burlingame
with
a
grateful
glance
and
a
tremendous
sigh
of
relief
that
i
think
of
it
raffles
holmes
that
it
i
er
i
remember
perfectly
that
er
that
i
did
wear
it
at
all
the
night
of
my
little
dinner
and
that
i
leave
it
behind
me
when
i
left
town
humph
said
i
that
may
account
for
the
extra
it
may
said
raffles
holmes
pursing
his
lips
into
a
deprecatory
smile
iv
the
adventure
of
the
missing
pendants
i
think
said
raffles
holmes
as
he
ran
over
his
expense
account
while
sitting
in
my
library
one
night
some
months
ago
that
in
view
of
the
present
condition
of
my
exchequer
my
dear
jenkins
it
behooveth
me
to
get
busy
owning
a
is
a
demned
expensive
piece
of
business
and
my
balance
at
the
bank
has
shrunk
to
about
thanks
to
my
bills
for
cogs
clutches
and
gasoline
plus
the
chauffeur
fines
in
what
capacity
shall
you
work
raffles
or
holmes
i
asked
pausing
in
my
writing
and
regarding
him
with
that
affectionate
interest
which
contact
with
him
had
inspired
in
me
play
the
combination
always
jenkins
he
replied
if
i
did
the
raffles
act
alone
i
should
become
the
billionaire
in
this
land
of
silk
and
money
your
rich
are
so
careless
of
their
wealth
but
where
would
my
conscience
be
on
the
other
hand
if
i
stuck
to
the
holmes
act
exclusively
i
starve
to
death
but
the
combination
ah
there
is
moderate
fortune
my
boy
with
peace
of
mind
thrown
in
here
he
rose
up
buttoned
his
coat
about
his
spare
figure
and
reached
out
for
his
hat
i
guess
i
tackle
that
case
of
the
missing
pendants
he
continued
flicking
the
ash
from
his
cigar
and
gazing
up
at
the
ceiling
with
that
strange
twist
in
his
eye
which
i
had
learned
to
regard
as
the
harbinger
of
a
dawning
idea
in
his
mind
there
ten
thousand
dollars
for
somebody
in
that
job
and
you
and
i
might
as
well
have
it
as
any
one
else
i
ready
said
i
as
well
i
might
be
for
all
i
had
to
do
in
the
matter
was
to
record
the
adventure
and
take
my
half
of
the
profits
no
very
difficult
proceeding
in
either
case
good
quoth
he
i
go
to
gaffany
and
offer
my
services
you
have
a
clew
i
asked
i
have
an
idea
he
answered
as
for
the
lost
diamonds
i
know
no
more
of
their
whereabouts
than
you
do
but
i
shall
be
able
beyond
all
question
to
restore
to
gaffany
two
pendants
just
as
good
as
those
they
have
lost
and
if
i
do
that
i
am
entitled
to
the
reward
i
fancy
am
i
not
most
certainly
said
i
but
where
the
dickens
will
you
find
two
such
stones
they
are
worth
apiece
and
they
must
match
perfectly
the
two
remaining
jewels
which
gaffany
have
in
their
safe
i
match
so
closely
that
their
own
mother
could
tell
apart
said
holmes
with
a
chuckle
then
the
report
that
they
are
of
such
rarity
of
cut
and
lustre
is
untrue
i
asked
it
perfectly
true
said
holmes
but
that
makes
no
difference
the
two
stones
that
i
shall
return
two
weeks
from
to
gaffany
will
be
as
like
the
two
they
have
as
they
are
themselves
jenkins
you
can
count
on
your
half
of
that
ten
thousand
as
surely
as
though
it
is
jingled
now
in
your
pockets
and
with
that
raffles
holmes
left
me
to
my
own
devices
i
presume
that
most
readers
of
the
daily
newspapers
are
tolerably
familiar
with
the
case
of
the
missing
pendants
to
which
holmes
referred
and
on
the
quest
for
which
he
was
now
about
to
embark
there
may
be
some
of
you
however
who
have
never
heard
of
the
mysterious
robbery
of
gaffany
by
which
two
diamonds
of
almost
matchless
purity
half
of
a
quartet
of
these
stones
and
valued
at
each
had
disappeared
almost
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
and
swallowed
them
up
they
were
a
part
of
the
famous
gloria
diamond
found
last
year
at
kimberley
a
huge
uncut
gem
of
such
value
that
no
single
purchaser
for
it
could
be
found
in
the
world
by
a
syndicate
arrangement
gaffany
had
assumed
charge
of
it
and
were
in
the
process
of
making
for
a
customer
a
bar
with
four
pendants
cut
from
the
original
when
two
of
them
disappeared
they
had
been
last
seen
in
the
hands
of
a
trusted
employé
of
many
years
standing
to
whom
they
had
been
intrusted
for
mounting
and
he
had
been
seen
to
replace
them
at
the
end
of
the
work
in
the
little
office
of
the
custodian
of
the
safe
in
which
jewels
of
great
value
were
kept
at
night
this
was
the
last
seen
of
them
and
although
five
weeks
had
elapsed
since
the
discovery
of
their
loss
and
holmes
decision
to
look
into
the
matter
no
clew
of
the
slightest
description
had
been
discovered
by
the
thousands
of
sleuths
professional
or
amateur
who
had
interested
themselves
in
the
case
he
had
such
assurance
i
muttered
to
hear
him
talk
one
would
almost
believe
that
they
were
already
in
his
possession
i
did
not
see
raffles
holmes
again
for
five
days
and
then
i
met
him
only
by
chance
nor
should
i
have
known
it
was
he
had
he
not
made
himself
known
to
me
i
was
on
my
way
uptown
a
little
after
six
and
as
i
passed
gaffany
an
aged
man
emerged
from
the
employés
entrance
carrying
a
small
bag
in
his
hand
he
was
apparently
very
for
he
most
unceremoniously
bumped
into
me
as
he
came
out
of
the
door
on
to
the
sidewalk
deference
to
age
has
always
been
a
weakness
of
mine
and
i
apologized
although
it
was
he
that
was
at
fault
do
mention
it
jenkins
he
whispered
you
are
just
the
man
i
want
to
see
café
panhard
eleven
just
happen
in
and
if
a
person
with
a
red
beard
speaks
to
you
do
throw
him
down
but
act
as
if
you
were
not
annoyed
by
his
mistake
you
know
me
i
asked
tush
man
i
raffles
holmes
and
with
that
he
was
off
his
was
perfect
and
as
he
hobbled
his
way
along
broadway
through
the
maze
of
cars
trucks
and
hansoms
there
was
not
in
any
part
of
him
a
hint
or
a
suggestion
that
brought
to
mind
my
alert
partner
of
course
my
excitement
was
intense
i
could
hardly
wait
for
eleven
to
come
and
at
i
found
myself
in
front
of
the
café
panhard
a
full
hour
and
a
half
ahead
of
time
and
never
were
there
more
minutes
in
that
period
of
waiting
than
there
seemed
to
be
then
as
i
paced
broadway
until
the
appointed
hour
it
seemed
ages
before
the
clock
down
in
front
of
the
whirald
building
pointed
to
but
at
last
the
moment
arrived
and
i
entered
the
café
taking
one
of
the
little
tables
in
the
farther
corner
where
the
light
was
not
unduly
strong
and
where
the
turmoil
of
the
hungarian
band
was
reduced
by
distance
from
moltofortissimo
to
a
moderate
approach
to
a
pianissimo
which
would
admit
of
conversation
again
i
had
to
wait
but
not
for
so
long
a
time
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
when
a
man
of
military
bearing
wearing
a
full
red
beard
entered
and
after
looking
the
café
over
sauntered
up
to
where
i
sat
jenkins
said
he
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
are
you
alone
yes
said
i
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
to
sit
here
for
a
few
moments
he
observed
pulling
out
the
chair
opposite
me
i
have
your
permission
certainly
er
robinstein
is
my
name
said
he
sitting
down
and
producing
a
letter
from
his
pocket
i
have
here
a
note
from
my
old
friend
raffles
holmes
a
note
of
introduction
to
you
i
am
a
manufacturer
of
paste
jewels
or
rather
was
i
have
had
one
or
two
misfortunes
in
my
business
and
find
myself
here
in
america
practically
stranded
your
place
of
business
was
in
the
rue
de
in
paris
he
explained
i
lost
everything
in
unfortunate
speculation
and
have
come
here
to
see
if
i
could
not
get
a
new
start
holmes
thinks
you
can
use
your
influence
with
markoo
the
theatrical
costumers
who
i
believe
manufacture
themselves
all
the
stage
jewelry
they
use
in
their
business
to
give
me
something
to
do
it
was
said
in
paris
that
the
gems
which
i
made
were
of
such
quality
that
they
would
deceive
for
a
time
anyhow
the
most
expert
lapidaries
and
if
i
can
only
get
an
opening
with
markoo
co
i
am
quite
confident
that
you
will
not
repent
having
exerted
your
good
offices
in
my
behalf
why
certainly
robinstein
said
i
any
friend
of
raffles
holmes
may
command
my
services
i
know
tommy
markoo
very
well
and
as
this
is
a
pretty
busy
time
with
him
getting
his
stuff
out
for
the
fall
productions
i
have
little
doubt
i
shall
be
able
to
help
you
by
jove
i
added
as
i
glanced
over
the
café
that
a
singular
coincidence
there
is
markoo
himself
just
coming
in
the
doorway
really
said
robinstein
turning
and
gazing
towards
the
door
he
a
chap
from
what
i
had
imagined
perhaps
jenkins
it
would
er
expedite
matters
if
you
of
course
i
interrupted
tommy
is
alone
we
have
him
over
and
i
beckoned
to
markoo
and
invited
him
to
join
us
good
said
he
in
his
way
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
see
you
i
so
confoundedly
busy
these
days
just
think
of
it
i
been
at
the
shop
ever
since
eight
this
morning
tommy
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
my
friend
robinstein
said
i
not
isidore
robinstein
of
paris
said
markoo
i
have
that
misfortune
markoo
said
robinstein
misfortune
gad
robinstein
we
look
at
things
through
different
glasses
returned
markoo
the
man
who
can
do
your
work
ought
never
to
suffer
misfortune
if
he
only
stays
out
of
the
said
robinstein
aha
laughed
tommy
et
tu
brute
we
all
laughed
and
if
there
was
any
ice
to
be
broken
after
that
it
was
along
the
line
of
business
of
the
café
we
got
along
famously
together
and
when
we
parted
company
two
hours
later
all
the
necessary
arrangements
had
been
made
for
robinstein
to
begin
at
once
with
markoo
the
following
day
in
fact
four
nights
later
holmes
turned
up
at
my
apartment
well
said
i
have
you
come
to
report
progress
yes
he
said
the
reward
will
arrive
on
time
but
it
been
the
own
job
pretty
are
they
he
added
taking
a
small
package
wrapped
in
out
of
his
pocket
and
disclosing
its
contents
what
beauties
i
cried
as
my
eyes
fell
on
two
such
diamonds
as
i
had
never
before
seen
they
sparkled
on
the
paper
like
bits
of
sunshine
and
that
their
value
was
quite
it
did
not
take
one
like
myself
who
knew
little
of
gems
to
see
at
a
glance
you
have
found
them
have
you
found
what
asked
raffles
holmes
the
missing
pendants
said
i
well
not
exactly
said
raffles
holmes
i
think
i
on
the
track
of
them
though
there
an
old
chap
who
works
beside
me
down
at
gaffany
who
spends
so
much
of
his
time
drinking
that
i
getting
to
be
suspicious
of
him
i
roared
with
laughter
the
habit
is
evidence
of
a
criminal
nature
eh
i
queried
not
per
se
said
holmes
gravely
but
in
conjunctibus
if
my
latin
is
weak
please
correct
me
it
is
a
very
suspicious
habit
when
i
see
a
man
drink
ten
glasses
of
water
in
two
hours
it
indicates
to
my
mind
that
there
is
something
in
the
that
takes
his
mind
off
his
business
it
is
not
likely
to
be
either
the
ice
or
the
water
on
the
doctrine
of
probabilities
hence
it
must
be
something
else
i
caught
him
yesterday
with
his
hand
in
it
his
hand
in
the
i
demanded
yes
said
holmes
he
said
he
was
fishing
around
for
a
little
piece
of
ice
to
cool
his
head
which
ached
but
i
think
differently
he
got
as
pale
as
a
ghost
when
i
started
in
to
fish
for
a
piece
for
myself
because
my
head
ached
too
i
think
he
took
the
diamonds
and
has
hid
them
there
but
i
not
sure
yet
and
in
my
business
i
ca
afford
to
make
mistakes
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
he
is
merely
awaiting
his
opportunity
to
fish
them
out
and
light
out
with
them
then
these
i
said
are
are
they
paste
no
indeed
they
the
real
thing
said
raffles
holmes
holding
up
one
of
the
gems
to
the
light
where
it
fairly
coruscated
with
brilliance
these
are
the
other
two
of
the
original
quartet
great
heavens
holmes
do
you
mean
to
say
that
gaffany
permit
you
to
go
about
with
things
like
this
in
your
pocket
i
demanded
not
they
laughed
holmes
they
have
a
fit
if
they
knew
i
had
only
they
do
know
it
but
how
have
you
concealed
the
fact
from
them
i
persisted
robinstein
made
me
a
pair
exactly
like
them
said
holmes
the
paste
ones
are
now
lying
in
the
gaffany
safe
where
i
saw
them
placed
before
leaving
the
shop
you
too
deep
for
me
holmes
said
i
what
the
game
now
do
say
game
jenkins
he
protested
i
never
indulge
in
games
my
quarry
is
not
a
game
but
a
scheme
for
the
past
two
weeks
with
three
days
off
i
have
been
acting
as
a
workman
in
the
gaffany
ship
with
the
ostensible
purpose
of
keeping
my
eye
on
certain
employés
who
are
under
suspicion
each
day
the
remaining
two
these
have
been
handed
to
me
to
work
on
merely
to
carry
out
the
illusion
the
first
day
in
odd
moments
i
made
sketches
of
them
and
on
the
night
of
the
second
i
had
down
in
such
detail
as
to
cut
and
color
that
robinstein
had
no
difficulty
in
reproducing
them
in
the
materials
at
his
disposal
in
shop
and
all
i
had
to
do
to
get
them
was
to
keep
them
and
hand
in
the
robinstein
substitutes
when
the
hour
of
closing
came
so
that
now
in
place
of
four
diamonds
gaffany
are
in
possession
of
two
paste
pendants
worth
about
apiece
said
holmes
if
i
fail
to
find
the
originals
i
shall
have
to
use
the
paste
ones
to
carry
the
scheme
through
but
i
hate
to
do
it
it
so
confoundly
inartistic
and
as
old
a
trick
as
the
pyramids
and
raffles
holmes
got
up
and
paced
the
floor
nervously
ah
jenkins
he
said
with
a
sigh
that
is
the
point
morrow
heavens
what
will
story
be
i
i
can
not
tell
what
the
matter
holmes
said
are
you
in
danger
physically
no
morally
my
god
jenkins
yes
i
shall
need
all
of
your
help
he
cried
what
can
i
do
i
asked
you
know
you
have
only
to
command
me
do
leave
me
this
night
for
a
minute
he
groaned
if
you
do
i
am
lost
the
raffles
in
me
is
rampant
when
i
look
at
those
jewels
and
think
of
what
they
will
mean
if
i
keep
them
an
independent
fortune
forever
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
get
aboard
a
ship
and
go
to
japan
and
live
in
comfort
the
rest
of
my
days
with
the
wealth
in
my
possession
and
all
the
instincts
of
honesty
that
i
possess
through
the
father
in
me
will
be
powerless
to
prevent
my
indulgence
in
this
crime
keep
me
in
sight
and
if
i
show
the
slightest
inclination
to
give
you
the
slip
knock
me
over
the
head
will
you
for
my
own
good
i
promised
faithfully
that
i
would
do
as
he
asked
but
as
an
easier
way
out
of
an
unpleasant
situation
i
drugged
his
remsen
cooler
with
a
powder
and
an
hour
later
he
was
lying
off
on
my
divan
lost
to
the
world
for
eight
hours
at
least
as
a
further
precaution
i
put
the
jewels
in
my
own
safe
the
night
sleep
had
the
desired
effect
and
with
the
returning
day
holmes
better
nature
asserted
itself
raffles
was
subdued
and
he
returned
to
gaffany
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
his
work
here
your
check
jenkins
said
raffles
holmes
handing
me
a
draft
for
the
gems
were
found
in
the
in
the
and
gaffany
paid
up
like
gentlemen
and
the
thief
i
asked
under
arrest
said
raffles
holmes
we
caught
him
fishing
for
them
and
your
paste
jewels
where
are
they
i
wish
i
knew
he
answered
his
face
clouding
over
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
of
the
arrest
i
got
mixed
with
the
originals
i
had
last
night
and
they
did
give
me
time
or
opportunity
to
pick
out
the
four
were
mounted
immediately
and
sent
under
guard
to
the
purchaser
gaffany
did
want
to
keep
them
a
minute
longer
than
was
necessary
but
the
purchaser
is
so
rich
he
will
never
have
to
sell
so
you
see
jenkins
we
as
safe
as
a
church
your
friend
robinstein
was
a
character
holmes
said
i
yes
sighed
holmes
poor
chap
he
was
a
great
loss
to
his
friends
he
taught
me
the
art
of
making
paste
gems
when
i
was
in
paris
i
miss
him
like
the
dickens
miss
him
said
i
getting
anxious
for
robinstein
what
happened
he
is
dead
said
holmes
two
years
ago
dear
old
chap
oh
come
now
holmes
i
said
what
new
game
is
this
you
are
rigging
on
me
i
met
him
only
five
nights
ago
and
you
know
it
oh
that
one
said
raffles
holmes
with
a
laugh
was
that
robinstein
you
i
cried
yes
me
said
holmes
you
do
suppose
i
let
a
third
party
into
our
secret
do
you
and
then
he
gave
me
one
of
those
sweet
wistful
smiles
that
made
the
wonder
of
the
man
all
the
greater
i
wish
to
the
dickens
i
knew
whether
these
were
real
or
paste
he
muttered
taking
the
extra
pendants
from
his
wallet
as
he
spoke
i
dare
ask
anybody
and
i
have
got
any
means
of
telling
myself
give
them
to
me
said
i
sternly
noting
a
glitter
in
his
eye
that
suggested
the
domination
for
the
moment
of
the
raffles
in
him
tush
jenkins
he
began
uneasily
give
them
to
me
or
i
brain
you
holmes
said
i
standing
over
him
with
a
bottle
gripped
in
my
right
hand
for
your
own
good
come
give
up
he
meekly
obeyed
come
now
get
on
your
hat
said
i
i
want
you
to
go
out
with
me
what
for
jenkins
he
almost
snarled
you
see
what
for
said
i
and
raffles
holmes
obeying
we
walked
down
to
the
river
edge
where
i
stood
for
a
moment
and
then
hurled
the
remaining
stones
far
out
into
the
waters
holmes
gave
a
gasp
and
then
a
sigh
of
relief
there
i
said
it
does
matter
much
to
us
now
whether
the
confounded
things
were
real
or
not
v
the
adventure
of
the
brass
check
jenkins
said
raffles
holmes
to
me
the
other
night
as
we
sat
in
my
den
looking
over
the
criminal
news
in
the
evening
papers
in
search
of
some
interesting
material
for
him
to
work
on
this
paper
says
that
wilbraham
has
gone
to
atlantic
city
for
a
week
and
will
lend
her
gracious
presence
to
the
social
functions
of
the
hotel
garrymore
at
that
interesting
city
by
the
sea
until
monday
the
when
she
will
depart
for
chicago
where
her
sister
is
to
be
married
on
the
how
would
you
like
to
spend
the
week
with
me
at
the
garrymore
it
all
depends
upon
what
we
are
going
for
said
i
also
what
in
thunder
has
wilbraham
got
to
do
with
us
or
we
with
her
nothing
at
all
said
holmes
that
is
nothing
much
who
is
she
i
asked
eying
him
suspiciously
all
i
know
is
what
i
have
seen
in
the
papers
said
holmes
she
came
in
on
the
two
weeks
ago
and
attracted
considerable
attention
by
declaring
worth
of
pearl
rope
that
she
bought
in
paris
instead
of
trying
to
smuggle
it
through
the
it
broke
the
heart
of
pretty
nearly
every
inspector
in
the
service
she
been
watched
very
carefully
by
the
detective
bureau
in
paris
and
when
she
purchased
the
rope
there
the
news
of
it
was
cabled
over
in
cipher
so
that
they
all
be
on
the
lookout
for
it
when
she
came
in
the
whole
force
on
the
pier
was
on
the
qui
vive
and
one
of
the
most
expert
women
searchers
on
the
was
detailed
to
give
her
special
attention
the
minute
she
set
foot
on
shore
but
instead
of
doing
as
they
all
believed
she
would
do
and
giving
the
inspectors
a
chance
to
catch
her
at
trying
to
evade
the
duties
to
their
very
great
profit
she
calmly
and
coolly
declared
the
stuff
paid
her
little
per
cent
like
a
major
and
drove
off
to
the
castoria
in
full
possession
of
her
jewels
the
collector
of
the
port
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
draping
the
for
thirty
days
they
were
all
so
she
probably
take
the
rope
to
atlantic
city
with
her
aha
said
i
that
the
milk
in
the
cocoanut
is
it
you
after
that
pearl
rope
are
you
raffles
on
my
honor
as
a
holmes
said
he
i
am
not
i
shall
not
touch
the
pearl
rope
although
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
shall
have
some
unhappy
moments
during
the
week
that
i
am
in
the
same
hotel
with
it
that
one
reason
why
i
like
to
have
you
go
along
jenkins
just
to
keep
me
out
of
temptation
raffles
may
need
more
than
holmes
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
i
am
confident
however
that
with
you
to
watch
out
for
me
i
shall
be
able
to
suppress
the
strong
tendency
towards
evil
which
at
times
besets
me
we
better
keep
out
of
it
altogether
holmes
said
i
not
liking
the
weight
of
responsibility
for
his
good
behavior
that
more
than
once
he
had
placed
on
my
shoulders
you
do
deny
i
suppose
that
the
pearl
rope
is
a
factor
in
your
intentions
whatever
they
may
be
of
course
i
do
jenkins
was
his
response
if
it
were
not
for
her
pearl
rope
wilbraham
could
go
anywhere
she
pleased
without
attracting
any
more
attention
from
me
than
a
passing
it
would
be
futile
for
me
to
deny
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
pearl
rope
is
an
essential
part
of
my
scheme
and
even
if
it
were
not
futile
to
do
so
i
should
still
not
deny
it
because
neither
my
father
nor
my
grandfather
holmes
nor
raffles
ever
forgot
that
a
gentleman
does
not
lie
then
count
me
out
said
i
even
if
there
is
in
it
for
you
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
if
it
were
you
could
still
count
me
out
i
retorted
i
like
the
business
very
well
said
he
with
a
sight
i
shall
have
to
go
alone
and
endeavor
to
fight
the
terrible
temptation
unaided
with
a
strong
probability
that
i
shall
fail
and
yielding
to
it
commit
my
first
real
act
of
crime
and
in
that
event
with
the
possibility
of
a
term
at
trenton
prison
if
i
am
caught
give
it
up
raffles
i
pleaded
and
all
because
in
the
hour
of
my
need
my
best
friend
whose
aid
i
begged
refused
me
he
went
on
absolutely
ignoring
my
plea
oh
well
if
you
put
it
on
that
score
i
said
i
go
but
you
must
promise
me
not
to
touch
the
pearls
i
do
my
best
not
to
he
replied
as
usual
you
have
to
put
me
out
of
business
if
you
catch
me
trying
it
with
this
understanding
i
accompanied
raffles
holmes
to
atlantic
city
the
following
afternoon
and
the
following
evening
we
were
registered
at
the
hotel
garrymore
holmes
was
not
mistaken
in
his
belief
that
wilbraham
would
take
her
famous
pearl
rope
to
atlantic
city
with
her
that
very
evening
while
we
were
sitting
at
dinner
the
lady
entered
and
draped
about
her
stately
neck
and
shoulders
was
the
thing
itself
and
a
more
beautiful
decoration
was
never
worn
by
woman
from
the
days
of
the
queen
of
sheba
to
this
day
of
lavish
display
in
jewels
it
was
a
marvel
indeed
but
the
moment
i
saw
it
i
ceased
to
give
the
lady
credit
for
superior
virtue
in
failing
to
smuggle
it
through
the
for
its
very
size
would
have
precluded
the
possibility
of
a
successful
issue
to
any
such
attempted
evasion
of
the
law
it
was
too
bulky
to
have
been
secreted
in
any
of
the
ordinary
ways
known
to
smugglers
hence
her
candid
acknowledgment
of
its
possession
was
less
an
evidence
of
the
lady
superiority
to
the
majority
of
her
sex
in
the
matter
of
beating
the
government
than
of
her
having
been
confronted
with
the
proverbial
choice
of
the
unidentified
hobson
by
jove
jenkins
raffles
holmes
muttered
hoarsely
as
paraded
the
length
of
the
as
fairly
corruscating
with
her
rich
possessions
as
though
she
were
a
jeweller
window
incarnate
it
a
positive
crime
for
a
woman
to
appear
in
a
place
like
this
arrayed
like
that
what
right
has
she
to
subject
poor
weak
humanity
to
such
temptation
as
now
confronts
every
servant
in
this
hotel
to
say
nothing
of
guests
who
like
ourselves
are
made
breathless
with
such
lavish
display
there
poor
old
tommie
bankson
over
there
for
instance
see
how
he
gloats
over
those
pearls
he
fairly
over
them
i
glanced
across
the
and
sure
enough
there
sat
tommie
bankson
and
even
from
where
we
were
placed
we
could
see
his
hands
tremble
with
the
itch
for
possession
and
his
lips
go
dry
with
excitement
as
he
thought
of
the
material
assets
in
full
view
under
the
glare
of
the
electric
lights
i
happen
to
know
on
the
inside
continued
holmes
that
tommie
is
not
only
a
virtual
bankrupt
through
stock
speculation
but
is
actually
face
to
face
with
criminal
disgrace
for
misuse
of
trust
funds
all
of
which
he
could
escape
if
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
half
the
stuff
that
woman
is
so
carelessly
wearing
do
you
think
it
fair
to
wear
for
the
mere
gratification
of
one
vanity
things
that
arouse
in
the
hearts
of
less
fortunate
beings
such
passionate
reflections
and
such
dire
temptations
as
those
which
are
now
besetting
that
man
i
guess
we
got
enough
to
do
looking
after
raffles
old
man
without
wasting
any
of
our
on
tommie
bankson
i
replied
come
on
let
get
out
of
this
we
go
over
to
the
pentagon
for
the
night
and
we
shake
the
sands
of
atlantic
city
from
our
feet
and
hie
ourselves
back
to
new
york
where
the
temptations
are
not
so
strong
it
too
late
said
raffles
holmes
i
set
out
on
this
adventure
and
i
going
to
put
it
through
i
would
give
up
in
the
middle
of
an
enterprise
of
this
sort
any
more
than
i
would
let
a
balky
horse
refuse
to
take
a
fence
i
put
him
to
it
going
to
be
harder
than
i
thought
but
we
in
it
and
i
shall
stay
to
the
end
what
the
devil
is
the
adventure
anyhow
i
demanded
impatiently
you
vowed
you
would
touch
the
rope
i
hope
not
to
was
his
response
it
is
up
to
you
to
see
that
i
do
my
plan
does
not
involve
my
laying
hands
upon
even
the
shadow
of
it
so
we
stayed
on
at
the
garrymore
and
a
worse
week
i
never
had
anywhere
with
every
glimpse
of
that
infernal
jewel
the
raffles
in
holmes
became
harder
and
harder
to
control
in
the
daytime
he
was
all
right
but
when
night
came
on
he
was
feverish
with
the
desire
to
acquire
possession
of
the
pearls
twice
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
caught
him
endeavoring
to
sneak
out
of
our
room
and
upon
each
occasion
when
i
rushed
after
him
and
forced
him
back
he
made
no
denial
of
my
charge
that
he
was
going
after
the
jewel
the
last
time
it
involved
us
both
in
such
a
terrible
struggle
that
i
vowed
then
and
there
that
the
following
morning
should
see
my
departure
i
ca
stand
the
strain
holmes
said
i
well
if
you
ca
stand
strain
said
raffles
holmes
what
do
you
think
of
mine
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
out
that
all
i
retorted
i
wo
have
a
nerve
left
in
hours
for
four
nights
now
i
have
had
a
minute
normal
sleep
and
this
fight
you
just
put
up
has
regularly
knocked
me
out
one
more
day
jenkins
he
pleaded
she
goes
day
after
and
so
do
we
we
i
cried
after
her
nope
she
to
chicago
we
to
new
york
said
holmes
stick
it
out
a
good
fellow
and
of
course
i
yielded
the
next
day
sunday
was
one
of
feverish
excitement
but
we
got
through
it
without
mishap
and
on
monday
morning
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
i
saw
wilbraham
pull
out
of
the
philadelphia
station
en
route
for
chicago
while
raffles
holmes
and
i
returned
to
new
york
well
raffles
said
i
as
we
sped
on
our
homeward
way
we
had
our
trouble
for
our
pains
he
laughed
crisply
have
we
said
he
i
guess
not
not
unless
you
have
lost
the
trunk
check
the
porter
gave
you
what
this
brass
thing
i
demanded
taking
the
check
from
my
pocket
and
flicking
it
in
the
air
like
a
penny
that
very
brass
thing
said
holmes
you
have
lifted
that
damned
rope
and
put
it
in
my
trunk
i
roared
hush
jenkins
for
heaven
sake
do
make
a
scene
i
have
done
anything
of
the
sort
he
whispered
looking
about
him
anxiously
to
make
sure
that
we
had
not
been
overheard
those
pearls
are
as
innocent
of
my
touch
as
the
top
of
the
himalaya
mountains
is
of
yours
then
what
have
you
done
i
demanded
sulkily
just
changed
a
couple
of
trunk
checks
that
all
said
raffles
holmes
that
bit
of
brass
you
have
in
your
hand
which
was
handed
to
you
in
the
station
by
the
porter
of
the
garrymore
when
presented
at
jersey
city
will
put
you
in
possession
of
wilbraham
trunk
containing
the
bulk
of
her
jewels
she
a
trifle
careless
about
her
possessions
as
any
one
could
see
who
watched
the
nonchalant
way
in
which
she
paraded
the
board
walk
with
a
small
fortune
on
her
neck
and
fingers
most
women
would
carry
such
things
in
a
small
or
at
least
have
the
trunk
sent
by
registered
express
but
not
wilbraham
and
thanks
to
her
loud
voice
listening
outside
of
her
door
last
night
i
heard
her
directing
her
maid
where
she
wished
the
gems
packed
and
where
the
dickens
is
my
trunk
i
asked
on
the
way
to
chicago
said
raffles
holmes
calmly
wilbraham
smythe
has
the
check
for
it
safe
business
i
sneered
bribed
the
porter
i
presume
jenkins
you
are
exceedingly
uncomplimentary
at
times
said
raffles
holmes
showing
more
resentment
than
i
had
ever
given
him
credit
for
perhaps
you
observed
that
i
did
go
to
the
station
in
the
omnibus
no
you
went
over
to
the
after
some
phenacetine
for
your
headache
said
i
precisely
said
holmes
and
after
purchasing
the
phenacetine
i
jumped
aboard
the
garrymore
and
got
a
lift
over
to
the
station
it
was
during
that
ride
that
i
transferred
check
from
her
trunk
to
yours
and
vice
versa
it
one
of
the
easiest
jobs
in
the
raffles
business
especially
at
this
season
of
the
year
when
travel
is
heavy
and
porters
are
overworked
i
see
the
trunk
in
the
hudson
river
pearl
rope
and
all
before
claim
it
at
jersey
city
or
anywhere
else
said
i
perfectly
right
holmes
returned
we
hand
the
check
to
the
expressman
when
he
comes
through
the
train
and
neither
of
us
need
appear
further
in
the
matter
it
will
merely
be
delivered
at
your
apartment
why
not
yours
said
i
raffles
said
he
laconically
and
i
understood
and
then
what
i
asked
let
it
alone
unopened
safe
as
a
church
until
wilbraham
discovers
her
loss
which
will
be
afternoon
and
then
well
holmes
will
step
in
unravel
the
mystery
prove
it
to
be
a
mere
innocent
mistake
collect
about
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
dollars
reward
divvy
up
with
you
and
the
decks
will
be
cleared
for
what
turns
up
next
said
this
wonderful
player
of
dangerous
games
and
as
a
beginning
jenkins
please
sign
this
he
added
holmes
handed
me
a
which
read
as
follows
the
richmore
june
raffles
holmes
dear
sir
i
enclose
herewith
my
check
for
as
a
retainer
for
your
services
in
locating
for
me
a
missing
trunk
which
contains
articles
which
i
value
at
this
trunk
was
checked
through
to
new
york
from
atlantic
city
on
monday
last
train
and
has
not
since
been
found
whether
or
not
it
has
been
stolen
or
has
gone
astray
in
some
wholly
innocent
manner
is
not
as
yet
clear
i
know
of
no
one
better
equipped
for
the
task
of
finding
it
for
me
than
yourself
who
i
am
given
to
understand
are
the
son
of
the
famous
sherlock
holmes
of
england
the
check
represents
the
ten
per
cent
commission
on
the
value
of
the
lost
articles
which
i
believe
is
the
customary
fee
for
services
such
as
i
seek
very
truly
yours
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
i
demanded
send
it
as
an
enclosure
to
wilbraham
showing
my
credentials
as
your
agent
in
asking
her
if
by
any
mischance
your
trunk
has
got
mixed
in
with
her
luggage
observed
holmes
for
form
sake
i
shall
send
it
to
twenty
or
thirty
other
people
known
to
have
left
atlantic
city
the
same
day
moreover
it
will
suggest
the
idea
to
wilbraham
that
i
am
a
good
man
to
locate
her
trunk
also
and
the
delicate
intimation
of
my
terms
will
aha
i
see
said
i
and
my
check
to
you
i
shall
of
course
keep
observed
holmes
you
want
the
whole
business
to
be
bona
fide
do
you
it
would
be
unscrupulous
for
you
to
ask
for
its
return
i
did
exactly
like
the
idea
but
after
all
there
was
much
in
what
holmes
said
and
the
actual
risk
of
my
own
capital
relieved
my
conscience
of
the
suspicion
that
by
signing
the
letter
i
should
become
a
partner
in
a
confidence
game
hence
i
signed
the
note
mailed
it
to
raffles
holmes
enclosing
my
check
for
with
it
three
days
later
holmes
entered
my
room
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
how
this
for
business
said
he
handing
me
a
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
from
chicago
dear
sir
i
am
perfectly
delighted
to
receive
your
letter
of
july
i
think
i
have
jenkins
missing
trunk
what
pleases
me
most
however
is
the
possibility
of
your
recovering
mine
which
also
went
astray
at
the
same
time
it
contained
articles
of
even
greater
value
than
jenkins
my
pearl
rope
among
other
things
which
is
appraised
at
do
you
think
there
is
any
chance
of
your
recovering
it
for
me
i
enclose
my
check
for
as
a
retainer
the
balance
of
your
ten
per
cent
fee
i
shall
gladly
pay
on
receipt
of
my
missing
luggage
most
sincerely
yours
maude
i
rather
think
my
dear
jenkins
observed
raffles
holmes
that
we
have
that
reward
cinched
there
for
you
jenkins
said
holmes
a
week
later
handing
me
his
check
for
that
amount
easy
money
that
it
only
took
two
weeks
to
turn
the
trick
and
for
fourteen
days
work
is
pretty
fair
pay
if
we
could
count
on
that
for
a
steady
income
i
think
i
be
able
to
hold
raffles
down
without
your
assistance
you
got
fourteen
thousand
eh
said
i
i
thought
it
was
only
to
be
it
was
fourteen
thousand
counting
in
your
said
raffles
holmes
you
see
i
playing
on
the
square
old
man
half
and
half
in
everything
i
squeezed
his
hand
affectionately
but
i
ejaculated
with
a
great
feeling
of
relief
i
glad
the
thing
over
with
so
am
i
said
holmes
with
a
glitter
in
his
eye
if
we
kept
that
trunk
in
this
apartment
another
day
there
have
been
trouble
i
had
a
piece
of
up
my
sleeve
when
i
called
here
tuesday
night
what
for
i
asked
you
said
raffles
holmes
if
you
had
had
that
with
you
have
knocked
you
out
and
gone
to
china
with
the
jewels
sherlock
holmes
stock
was
below
par
tuesday
night
vi
the
adventure
of
the
hired
burglar
i
had
not
seen
raffles
holmes
for
some
weeks
nor
had
i
heard
from
him
although
i
had
faithfully
remitted
to
his
address
his
share
of
the
literary
proceeds
of
his
adventures
as
promptly
as
circumstances
permitted
on
the
first
tale
on
the
second
and
no
less
than
on
the
third
showing
a
constantly
growing
profit
on
our
combination
from
my
side
of
the
venture
these
checks
had
not
even
been
presented
for
payment
at
the
bank
fearing
from
this
that
he
might
be
ill
i
called
at
holmes
lodgings
in
the
rexmere
a
bachelor
apartment
hotel
on
street
to
inquire
as
to
the
state
of
his
health
the
clerk
behind
the
desk
greeted
my
cordially
as
i
entered
and
bade
me
go
at
once
to
apartment
on
the
eighteenth
floor
which
i
immediately
proceeded
to
do
here
is
holmes
sir
said
the
clerk
he
told
me
you
were
to
have
access
to
his
apartment
at
any
time
he
is
in
is
he
i
asked
i
really
do
know
sir
i
will
call
up
and
inquire
if
you
wish
replied
the
clerk
oh
never
mind
said
i
i
go
up
anyhow
and
if
he
is
out
i
wait
so
up
i
went
and
a
few
moments
later
had
entered
the
apartment
as
the
door
opened
the
little
private
hallway
leading
to
his
den
at
the
rear
burst
into
a
flood
of
light
and
from
an
inner
room
the
entrance
to
which
was
closed
i
could
hear
holmes
voice
cheerily
carolling
out
snatches
of
such
popular
airs
as
tammany
and
ef
yo
hab
got
no
money
yo
need
bodder
me
i
laughed
quietly
and
at
the
same
time
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
it
was
very
evident
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
there
was
nothing
serious
the
matter
with
my
friend
and
partner
hullo
raffles
i
called
out
knocking
on
the
door
to
the
inner
room
swampum
swampum
get
their
wampum
was
the
sole
answer
and
in
such
fortissimo
tones
that
i
was
not
surprised
that
he
did
not
hear
me
oh
i
say
raffles
i
hallooed
rapping
on
the
door
again
this
time
with
the
head
of
my
cane
it
jenkins
old
man
came
to
look
you
up
was
afraid
something
had
happened
to
you
down
upon
the
suwanee
river
far
far
away
dere
whar
my
heart
am
turnin
ever
dere
whar
de
ole
folks
stay
was
the
reply
again
i
laughed
he
suffering
from
a
bad
attack
of
coonitis
this
evening
i
observed
to
myself
looks
to
me
as
if
i
have
to
let
it
run
its
course
whereupon
i
retired
to
a
very
comfortable
couch
near
the
window
and
sat
down
to
await
the
termination
of
the
musical
five
minutes
later
the
singing
having
shown
no
signs
of
abatement
i
became
impatient
and
a
third
assault
on
the
door
followed
this
time
with
cane
hands
and
toes
in
unison
i
have
him
out
this
time
or
die
i
ejaculated
filled
with
resolve
and
then
began
such
a
pounding
upon
the
door
as
should
have
sufficed
to
awake
a
dead
raffles
not
to
mention
a
living
one
hi
there
jenkins
cried
a
voice
behind
me
in
the
midst
of
this
operation
identically
the
same
voice
too
as
that
still
going
on
in
the
room
in
front
of
me
what
the
dickens
are
you
trying
to
do
batter
the
house
down
i
whirled
about
like
a
flash
and
was
deeply
startled
to
see
raffles
himself
standing
by
the
divan
i
had
just
vacated
divesting
himself
of
his
gloves
and
light
overcoat
you
raffles
i
roared
in
astonishment
yep
said
he
who
else
but
the
the
other
chap
in
the
room
there
oh
laughed
raffles
that
my
hold
on
a
minute
and
show
you
whereupon
he
unlocked
the
door
into
the
bedroom
whence
had
come
the
tuneful
lyrics
threw
it
wide
open
and
revealed
to
my
astonished
gaze
no
less
an
object
than
a
large
still
engaged
in
the
strenuous
fulfilment
of
its
noisy
mission
what
the
dickens
i
said
it
attached
to
my
said
raffles
silencing
the
machine
the
minute
the
door
is
opened
it
begins
to
sing
like
the
blackbirds
baked
in
a
pie
but
what
good
is
it
said
i
oh
well
it
keeps
the
servants
from
spending
too
much
time
in
my
apartment
snooping
among
my
papers
perhaps
and
it
my
some
day
come
in
useful
in
establishing
an
alibi
if
things
go
wrong
with
me
you
have
sworn
i
was
in
there
just
now
would
you
i
would
indeed
said
i
well
you
see
i
was
so
there
you
are
said
raffles
holmes
you
come
at
an
interesting
moment
there
be
things
doing
before
the
evening
is
over
i
had
an
anxious
caller
here
five
times
already
i
been
standing
in
the
opposite
getting
a
line
on
him
his
card
name
is
grouch
his
real
name
is
here
raffles
holmes
leaned
forward
and
whispered
in
my
ear
a
name
of
such
eminent
respectability
that
i
fairly
gasped
you
do
mean
nobody
else
said
raffles
holmes
only
he
do
know
i
know
who
he
is
the
third
time
grouch
called
i
trailed
him
to
blank
house
and
then
recognized
him
as
blank
himself
and
what
does
he
want
with
you
i
asked
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
raffles
holmes
all
i
know
is
that
next
tuesday
he
will
be
required
to
turn
over
unregistered
bonds
to
a
young
man
about
to
come
of
age
for
whom
he
has
been
a
trustee
aha
said
i
and
you
think
i
do
think
jenkins
until
the
time
comes
gray
matter
is
scarce
these
times
and
i
not
wasting
any
of
mine
on
unnecessary
speculation
said
raffles
holmes
at
this
point
the
rang
and
raffles
answered
the
summons
yes
i
see
grouch
show
him
up
he
said
it
would
be
mighty
interesting
reading
if
some
newspaper
showed
him
up
he
added
with
a
grin
as
he
returned
jenkins
i
think
you
better
go
in
there
and
have
a
chat
with
the
i
have
an
idea
old
man
grouch
wo
have
much
to
say
with
a
third
party
present
listen
all
you
want
to
but
do
breathe
too
loud
or
you
frighten
him
away
i
immediately
retired
and
a
moment
later
grouch
entered
raffles
holmes
den
glad
to
see
you
said
raffles
holmes
cordially
i
was
wondering
how
soon
you
be
here
you
expected
me
then
asked
the
visitor
in
surprise
yes
said
holmes
next
tuesday
is
young
wilbraham
birthday
and
peering
through
a
crack
in
the
door
i
could
see
grouch
stagger
you
you
know
my
errand
then
he
gasped
out
only
roughly
grouch
said
holmes
coolly
only
roughly
but
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
i
ca
do
what
you
want
me
to
those
bonds
are
doubtless
in
some
broker
box
in
a
company
and
i
propose
to
try
to
borrow
them
surreptitiously
even
temporarily
from
an
incorporated
institution
it
is
not
only
a
dangerous
but
a
criminal
operation
does
your
employer
know
that
you
have
taken
them
my
employer
stammered
grouch
taken
off
his
guard
yes
are
you
the
confidential
secretary
of
mr
here
holmes
mentioned
the
name
of
the
eminent
financier
and
philanthropist
no
one
would
have
suspected
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
holmes
was
perfectly
aware
that
grouch
and
the
eminent
financier
were
one
and
the
same
person
the
idea
seemed
to
please
and
steady
the
visitor
why
ah
yes
i
am
blank
confidential
secretary
he
blurted
out
and
ah
of
course
blank
does
not
know
that
i
have
speculated
with
the
bonds
and
lost
them
the
bonds
are
in
the
hands
of
bunker
burke
i
had
hoped
you
would
be
able
to
suggest
some
way
in
which
i
could
get
hold
of
them
long
enough
to
turn
them
over
to
young
wilbraham
and
then
in
some
other
way
to
restore
them
later
to
bunker
burke
that
is
impossible
said
raffles
holmes
for
the
reasons
stated
i
can
not
be
party
to
a
criminal
operation
it
will
mean
ruin
for
me
if
it
can
not
be
done
moaned
grouch
for
blank
as
well
holmes
he
is
so
deep
in
the
market
he
ca
possibly
pull
out
i
thought
possibly
you
knew
of
some
reformed
cracksman
who
would
do
this
one
favor
for
me
just
to
tide
things
over
all
we
need
is
three
weeks
time
three
miserable
little
weeks
ca
be
done
with
a
company
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
said
raffles
holmes
if
it
were
blank
own
private
vault
at
his
home
it
would
be
different
that
would
be
a
matter
between
gentlemen
between
blank
and
myself
but
the
other
would
put
a
corporation
on
the
trail
of
the
an
uncompromising
situation
grouch
eye
glistened
you
know
a
man
who
for
a
consideration
and
with
a
guarantee
against
prosecution
would
break
open
my
i
mean
blank
private
vault
he
cried
i
think
so
said
raffles
holmes
noncommittally
not
as
a
crime
however
merely
as
a
favor
and
with
the
lofty
purpose
of
saving
an
honored
name
from
ruin
my
advice
to
you
would
be
to
put
a
dummy
package
supposed
to
contain
the
missing
bonds
along
with
about
worth
of
other
securities
in
that
vault
and
so
arrange
matters
that
on
the
night
preceding
the
date
of
young
wilbraham
majority
the
man
i
will
send
you
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
crack
it
open
and
get
away
with
the
stuff
unmolested
and
unseen
next
day
young
wilbraham
will
see
for
himself
why
it
is
that
blank
can
not
turn
over
the
trust
that
is
the
only
secure
and
i
may
say
decently
honest
way
out
of
your
trouble
raffles
holmes
you
are
a
genius
cried
grouch
ecstatically
and
then
he
calmed
down
again
as
an
unpleasant
thought
flashed
across
his
mind
why
is
it
necessary
to
put
additional
in
the
safe
mr
holmes
simply
as
a
blind
said
holmes
young
wilbraham
would
be
suspicious
if
the
burglar
got
away
with
nothing
but
his
property
would
he
quite
so
said
grouch
and
now
holmes
what
will
this
service
cost
me
five
thousand
dollars
said
holmes
whistled
grouch
is
that
pretty
steep
no
grouch
i
save
two
reputations
yours
and
blank
hundred
dollars
is
not
much
to
pay
for
a
reputation
these
days
i
mean
a
real
one
of
course
such
as
yours
is
up
to
date
said
holmes
coldly
payable
by
certified
check
said
grouch
not
much
laughed
holmes
in
bills
grouch
you
may
leave
them
in
the
safe
along
with
the
other
valuables
thank
you
holmes
said
grouch
rising
it
shall
be
as
you
say
before
i
go
sir
may
i
ask
how
you
knew
me
and
by
what
principle
of
deduction
you
came
to
guess
my
business
so
accurately
it
was
simple
enough
said
holmes
i
knew
in
the
first
place
that
so
eminent
a
person
as
blank
would
not
come
to
me
in
the
guise
of
a
grouch
if
he
had
some
very
serious
trouble
on
his
mind
i
knew
from
reading
the
society
items
in
the
that
bobby
wilbraham
would
celebrate
the
attainment
of
his
majority
by
a
big
fête
on
the
of
next
month
everybody
knows
that
blank
is
wilbraham
trustee
until
he
comes
of
age
it
was
easy
enough
to
surmise
from
that
what
the
nature
of
the
trouble
was
two
and
two
almost
invariably
make
four
mr
grouch
and
how
the
devil
demanded
grouch
angrily
how
the
devil
did
you
know
i
was
blank
blank
passes
the
plate
at
the
church
i
go
to
every
sunday
said
holmes
laughing
and
it
would
take
a
great
sight
more
than
a
wig
and
a
pair
of
whiskers
to
conceal
that
pompous
manner
of
his
tush
you
would
better
not
make
me
angry
holmes
said
grouch
reddening
you
can
get
as
angry
as
you
think
you
can
afford
to
for
all
i
care
blank
said
holmes
it
none
of
my
funeral
you
know
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
the
unmasked
blank
seeing
that
wrath
was
useless
calmed
down
and
accepted
holmes
terms
and
method
for
his
relief
i
have
my
man
there
at
october
blank
said
holmes
see
that
your
end
of
it
is
ready
the
coast
must
be
kept
clear
or
the
scheme
falls
through
grouch
went
heavily
out
and
holmes
called
me
back
into
the
room
jenkins
said
he
that
man
is
one
of
the
biggest
scoundrels
in
creation
and
i
going
to
give
him
a
jolt
where
are
you
going
to
get
the
retired
burglar
i
asked
sir
returned
raffles
holmes
this
is
to
be
a
personally
conducted
enterprise
it
a
job
worthy
of
my
grandsire
on
my
mother
side
raffles
will
turn
the
trick
and
it
turned
out
so
to
be
for
the
affair
went
through
without
a
hitch
the
night
of
october
i
spend
at
raffles
apartments
he
was
as
calm
as
though
nothing
unusual
were
on
hand
he
sang
songs
played
the
piano
and
up
to
midnight
was
as
gay
and
skittish
as
a
on
vacation
as
twelve
struck
however
he
sobered
down
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
bidding
me
remain
where
i
was
departed
by
means
of
the
keep
up
the
talk
jenkins
he
said
the
walls
are
thin
here
and
just
as
well
in
matters
of
this
sort
that
our
neighbors
should
have
the
impression
that
i
have
gone
out
i
filled
the
machine
up
with
a
choice
lot
of
songs
and
to
take
care
of
my
end
of
it
a
consolidated
gas
company
like
yourself
should
have
no
difficulty
in
filling
in
the
gaps
and
with
that
he
left
me
to
as
merry
and
withal
as
nervous
a
three
hours
as
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
raffles
had
indeed
filled
that
thirteen
full
cylinders
of
it
with
as
choice
an
assortment
of
causeries
and
humorous
anecdotes
as
any
one
could
have
wished
to
hear
now
and
again
it
would
bid
me
cheer
up
and
not
worry
about
him
once
along
about
it
cried
out
you
ought
to
see
me
now
jenkins
i
right
in
the
middle
of
this
grouch
job
and
it
a
dandy
i
teach
a
lesson
the
effect
of
all
this
was
most
uncanny
it
was
as
if
raffles
holmes
himself
spoke
to
me
from
the
depths
of
that
dark
room
in
the
blank
household
where
he
was
engaged
in
an
enterprise
of
dreadful
risk
merely
to
save
the
good
name
of
one
who
no
longer
deserved
to
bear
such
a
thing
in
spite
of
all
this
however
as
the
hours
passed
i
began
to
grow
more
and
more
nervous
the
sang
and
chattered
but
when
four
came
and
holmes
had
not
yet
returned
i
became
almost
frenzied
with
excitement
and
then
at
the
climax
of
the
tension
came
the
flash
of
his
on
the
and
he
climbed
heavily
into
the
room
thank
heaven
you
back
i
cried
you
have
reason
to
said
holmes
sinking
into
a
chair
give
me
some
whiskey
that
man
blank
is
a
worse
scoundrel
than
i
took
him
for
what
happened
i
asked
did
he
play
square
no
said
holmes
breathing
heavily
he
waited
until
i
had
busted
the
thing
open
and
was
on
my
way
out
in
the
dark
hall
and
then
pounced
on
me
with
his
butler
and
valet
i
bowled
the
butler
down
the
kitchen
stairs
and
sent
the
valet
howling
into
the
with
an
appendicitis
jab
in
the
stomach
and
had
the
pleasure
of
blacking
both
of
blank
eyes
and
the
stuff
right
here
said
holmes
tapping
his
chest
i
was
afraid
something
might
happen
on
the
way
out
and
i
kept
both
hands
free
i
have
much
confidence
in
philanthropists
like
blank
fortunately
the
scrimmage
was
in
the
dark
so
blank
will
never
know
who
hit
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
i
queried
as
we
went
over
the
booty
later
and
found
it
all
there
do
know
have
made
up
my
mind
said
holmes
laconically
i
too
tired
to
think
about
that
now
it
me
for
bed
and
with
that
he
turned
in
two
days
later
about
nine
in
the
evening
grouch
again
called
and
holmes
received
him
courteously
well
holmes
grouch
observed
unctuously
rubbing
his
hands
together
it
was
a
nice
job
neatly
done
it
saved
the
day
for
me
wilbraham
was
satisfied
and
has
given
me
a
whole
year
to
make
good
the
loss
my
reputation
is
saved
and
excuse
me
blank
or
grouch
er
to
what
do
you
refer
asked
holmes
why
our
little
transaction
of
monday
night
or
was
it
tuesday
morning
said
grouch
oh
that
said
holmes
well
i
glad
to
hear
you
managed
to
pull
it
off
satisfactorily
i
was
a
little
worried
about
it
i
was
afraid
you
were
done
for
done
for
said
grouch
no
indeed
the
little
plan
when
off
without
a
hitch
good
said
holmes
i
congratulate
you
did
you
get
to
do
the
job
who
what
what
why
what
do
you
mean
mr
holmes
gasped
grouch
precisely
what
i
say
or
maybe
you
do
like
to
tell
me
such
things
are
apt
to
be
on
a
confidential
basis
anyhow
i
glad
you
safe
grouch
and
i
hope
your
troubles
are
over
they
will
be
when
you
give
me
back
my
said
grouch
your
what
demanded
holmes
with
surprise
my
repeated
blank
his
voice
rising
to
a
shout
my
dear
grouch
said
holmes
how
should
i
know
anything
about
your
did
your
your
man
take
it
demanded
grouch
huskily
my
man
really
grouch
you
speak
in
riddles
this
evening
pray
make
yourself
more
clear
your
reformed
burglar
who
broke
open
my
safe
and
grouch
went
on
i
have
no
such
man
mr
grouch
did
you
send
a
man
to
my
house
raffles
to
break
open
my
safe
and
take
certain
specified
parcels
of
negotiable
property
therefrom
said
grouch
rising
and
pounding
the
table
with
his
fists
did
not
returned
holmes
with
equal
emphasis
i
have
never
in
my
life
sent
anybody
to
your
house
sir
then
who
in
the
name
of
heaven
did
roared
grouch
the
stuff
is
gone
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
willing
said
he
calmly
to
undertake
to
find
out
who
did
it
if
anybody
if
that
is
what
you
mean
grouch
ferreting
out
crime
is
my
profession
otherwise
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
my
interest
in
the
case
ceases
at
this
moment
here
holmes
rose
with
quiet
dignity
and
walked
to
the
door
you
will
find
me
at
my
office
in
the
morning
mr
grouch
he
remarked
in
case
you
wish
to
consult
me
professionally
hah
sneered
grouch
you
think
you
can
put
me
off
this
way
do
you
i
think
so
said
holmes
with
a
glittering
eye
no
gentleman
or
other
person
may
try
to
raise
a
disturbance
in
my
private
apartments
and
remain
there
we
see
what
the
police
have
to
say
about
this
raffles
holmes
grouch
shrieked
as
he
made
for
the
door
very
well
said
holmes
i
no
doubt
they
will
find
our
discussion
of
the
other
sinners
very
interesting
they
are
welcome
to
the
whole
story
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
he
closed
the
door
on
the
ashen
face
of
the
suffering
grouch
what
shall
i
do
with
your
share
of
the
jenkins
said
raffles
holmes
a
week
later
anything
you
please
said
i
only
do
offer
any
of
it
to
me
i
question
the
abstract
justice
of
your
mulcting
old
blank
for
the
amount
but
somehow
or
other
i
do
want
any
of
it
myself
send
it
to
the
board
of
foreign
missions
good
said
holmes
that
what
i
done
with
my
share
see
and
he
showed
me
an
evening
paper
in
which
the
board
conveyed
its
acknowledgment
of
the
generosity
of
an
unknown
donor
of
the
princely
sum
of
vii
the
redemption
of
young
billington
rand
jenkins
said
raffles
holmes
lighting
his
pipe
and
throwing
himself
down
upon
my
couch
do
you
sometimes
pine
for
those
good
old
days
of
jack
sheppard
and
dick
turpin
hang
it
all
i
getting
blisteringly
tired
of
the
modern
refinements
in
crime
and
yearn
for
the
period
when
the
highwayman
met
you
on
the
road
and
made
you
stand
and
deliver
at
the
point
of
the
pistol
indeed
i
do
i
ejaculated
i
not
raffles
but
mighty
glad
my
lines
are
cast
in
less
strenuous
scenes
when
a
comes
in
here
for
instance
and
holds
me
up
for
nineteen
dollars
a
volume
for
a
set
of
kipling
in
words
of
one
syllable
illustrated
by
his
aunt
and
every
volume
autographed
by
his
uncle
it
a
game
of
wits
between
us
as
to
whether
i
shall
buy
or
not
buy
and
if
he
gets
away
with
my
signature
to
a
contract
it
is
because
he
has
legitimately
outwitted
me
but
your
ancient
turpin
overcame
you
by
brute
force
you
had
a
run
for
your
money
from
the
moment
he
got
his
eye
on
you
and
no
percentage
of
the
swag
was
ever
returned
to
you
as
in
the
case
of
the
edition
of
kipling
in
which
you
get
at
least
fifty
cents
worth
of
paper
and
print
for
every
nineteen
dollars
you
give
up
that
is
merely
the
commercial
way
of
looking
at
it
protested
holmes
you
reckon
up
the
situation
on
a
basis
of
mere
dollars
strike
a
balance
and
charge
the
thing
up
to
profit
and
loss
but
the
romance
of
it
all
the
element
of
the
picturesque
the
delicious
tingling
sense
of
adventure
which
was
inseparable
from
a
road
experience
with
a
commanding
personality
like
turpin
these
things
are
all
lost
in
your
prosaic
methods
of
our
day
no
man
writing
his
memoirs
for
the
enlightenment
of
posterity
would
ever
dream
of
setting
down
upon
paper
the
story
of
how
a
robbed
him
of
dollars
but
the
chap
who
has
been
held
up
in
the
dark
recesses
of
a
forest
on
a
foggy
night
by
a
jack
sheppard
would
always
find
breathless
and
eager
listeners
to
or
readers
of
the
tale
he
had
to
tell
even
if
he
lost
only
a
nickel
by
the
transaction
well
old
man
said
i
i
satisfied
with
the
prosaic
methods
of
the
gas
companies
the
and
the
riggers
of
the
give
me
wall
street
and
you
take
dick
turpin
and
all
his
crew
but
what
has
set
your
mind
to
working
on
the
dick
turpin
end
of
it
anyhow
thinking
of
going
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
yourself
yes
replied
holmes
hesitatingly
i
am
not
that
i
pine
to
become
one
of
the
broom
squires
myself
but
because
i
well
i
may
be
forced
into
it
take
my
advice
raffles
i
interrupted
earnestly
let
and
highways
alone
there
too
much
of
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
in
loaded
guns
and
surplus
of
publicity
in
street
work
you
must
take
me
so
literally
jenkins
he
retorted
i
not
going
to
follow
precisely
in
the
steps
of
turpin
but
a
on
the
public
highway
seems
to
be
the
only
way
out
of
a
problem
which
i
have
been
employed
to
settle
do
you
know
young
billington
rand
by
sight
said
i
with
a
laugh
and
by
reputation
you
not
going
to
hold
him
up
are
you
i
added
contemptuously
why
not
said
holmes
it
like
breaking
into
an
empty
house
in
search
of
antique
furniture
i
explained
common
report
has
it
that
billington
rand
has
already
been
skinned
by
about
every
skinning
agency
in
town
he
posted
at
all
his
clubs
every
gambler
in
town
professional
as
well
as
social
has
his
for
bridge
poker
and
faro
debts
everybody
knows
it
except
those
fatuous
people
down
in
the
kenesaw
national
bank
where
he
employed
and
the
fidelity
company
that
on
his
bond
he
would
last
five
minutes
in
either
place
if
his
uncle
was
a
director
in
both
concerns
i
see
that
you
have
a
pretty
fair
idea
of
billington
rand
financial
condition
said
holmes
it
rather
common
talk
in
the
clubs
so
why
should
i
i
put
in
holding
him
up
would
be
at
most
an
act
of
petit
larceny
if
you
measure
a
crime
by
what
you
get
out
of
it
it
a
great
shame
though
for
at
heart
rand
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
he
a
man
who
has
all
the
modern
false
notions
of
what
a
fellow
ought
to
do
to
keep
up
what
he
calls
his
end
he
plays
cards
and
sustains
ruinous
losses
because
he
thinks
he
wo
be
considered
a
if
he
stays
out
he
plays
bridge
with
ladies
and
pays
up
when
he
loses
and
does
collect
when
he
wins
win
or
lose
he
doomed
to
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
market
just
because
of
those
very
qualities
that
make
him
a
lovable
person
kind
to
everybody
but
himself
and
weak
as
for
heaven
sake
raffles
if
the
poor
devil
anything
left
do
take
it
from
him
your
sympathy
for
rand
does
you
credit
said
holmes
but
i
have
just
as
much
of
that
as
you
have
and
that
is
why
at
five
morrow
afternoon
i
going
to
hold
him
up
in
the
public
eye
and
incontinently
rob
him
of
thousand
dollars
billington
rand
i
gasped
thousand
dollars
billington
rand
repeated
holmes
firmly
if
you
do
believe
it
come
along
and
see
he
does
know
you
does
he
not
from
adam
said
i
very
good
then
you
be
safe
as
a
church
meet
me
in
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
corridor
at
five
afternoon
and
i
show
you
as
pretty
a
as
you
ever
dreamed
of
said
holmes
but
i
ca
take
part
in
a
criminal
proceeding
like
that
holmes
i
protested
you
wo
have
to
even
if
it
were
a
criminal
proceeding
which
it
is
not
he
returned
nobody
outside
of
you
and
me
will
know
anything
about
it
but
rand
himself
and
the
chances
that
he
will
peach
are
less
than
a
millionth
part
of
a
half
per
cent
anyhow
all
you
need
be
is
a
witness
there
was
a
long
and
uneasy
silence
i
was
far
from
liking
the
job
but
after
all
so
far
holmes
had
not
led
me
into
any
difficulties
of
a
serious
nature
and
knowing
him
as
i
had
come
to
know
him
i
had
a
hearty
belief
that
any
wrong
he
did
was
temporary
and
was
sure
to
be
rectified
in
the
long
run
i
a
decent
motive
in
all
this
jenkins
he
resumed
in
a
few
moments
do
forget
that
this
is
going
to
result
in
a
reformation
that
will
be
for
the
good
of
everybody
so
do
have
any
scruples
on
that
score
all
right
raffles
said
i
you
always
played
straight
with
me
so
far
and
i
do
doubt
your
word
only
i
hate
the
highway
end
of
it
tutt
jenkins
he
ejaculated
with
a
laugh
and
giving
me
a
whack
on
the
shoulders
that
nearly
toppled
me
over
into
the
do
be
a
rabbit
the
thing
will
be
as
easy
as
cutting
jelly
with
a
razor
thus
did
i
permit
myself
to
be
persuaded
and
the
next
afternoon
at
five
holmes
and
i
met
in
the
corridor
of
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
come
on
he
said
after
the
first
salutations
were
over
rand
will
be
at
the
street
subway
at
and
it
is
important
that
we
should
catch
him
before
he
gets
to
fifth
avenue
i
glad
it
to
be
on
a
side
street
i
remarked
my
heart
beating
rapidly
with
excitement
over
the
work
in
hand
for
the
more
i
thought
of
the
venture
the
less
i
liked
it
oh
i
do
know
that
it
will
be
said
holmes
carelessly
i
may
pull
it
off
in
the
corridors
of
the
powhatan
the
pumps
in
my
heart
reversed
their
action
and
for
a
moment
i
feared
i
should
drop
with
dismay
in
the
powhatan
i
began
shut
up
jenkins
said
holmes
imperatively
this
is
no
time
for
protests
we
in
it
now
and
there
no
drawing
back
ten
minutes
later
we
stood
at
the
intersection
of
street
and
fifth
avenue
holmes
eyes
flashed
and
his
whole
nervous
system
quivered
as
with
the
joy
of
the
chase
keep
your
mouth
shut
jenkins
and
you
see
a
pretty
sight
he
whispered
for
here
comes
our
man
sure
enough
there
was
billington
rand
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
walking
along
nervously
and
clutching
an
oblong
package
wrapped
in
brown
paper
firmly
in
his
right
hand
now
for
it
said
holmes
and
we
crossed
the
street
scarcely
reaching
the
opposite
curb
before
rand
was
upon
us
rand
eyed
us
closely
and
shied
off
to
one
side
as
holmes
blocked
his
progress
i
trouble
you
for
that
package
rand
said
holmes
quietly
the
man
face
went
white
and
he
caught
his
breath
who
the
devil
are
you
he
demanded
angrily
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
retorted
holmes
i
want
that
package
or
get
out
of
my
way
cried
rand
with
a
justifiable
show
of
resentment
or
i
call
an
officer
will
you
said
holmes
quietly
will
you
call
an
officer
and
so
make
known
to
the
authorities
that
you
are
in
possession
of
thousand
dollars
worth
of
securities
that
belong
to
other
people
which
are
supposed
at
this
moment
to
be
safely
locked
up
in
the
vaults
of
the
kenesaw
national
back
along
with
other
collateral
rand
staggered
back
against
the
of
a
stoop
and
stood
there
gazing
wildly
into
holmes
face
of
course
if
you
prefer
having
the
facts
made
known
in
that
way
holmes
continued
coolly
you
have
the
option
i
am
not
going
to
use
physical
force
to
persuade
you
to
hand
the
package
over
to
me
but
you
are
a
greater
fool
than
i
take
you
for
if
you
choose
that
alternative
to
use
an
expressive
modern
phrase
billington
rand
you
will
be
caught
with
the
goods
on
and
unless
you
have
a
far
better
explanation
of
how
those
securities
happen
in
your
possession
at
this
moment
than
i
think
you
have
there
is
no
power
on
earth
can
keep
you
from
landing
in
the
unfortunate
victim
of
holmes
adventure
fairly
gasped
in
his
combined
rage
and
fright
twice
he
attempted
to
speak
but
only
inarticulate
sounds
issued
from
his
lips
you
are
of
course
very
much
disturbed
at
the
moment
holmes
went
on
and
i
am
really
very
sorry
if
anything
i
have
done
has
disarranged
any
honorable
enterprise
in
which
you
have
embarked
i
do
wish
to
hurry
you
into
a
snap
decision
which
you
may
repent
later
only
either
the
police
or
i
must
have
that
package
within
an
hour
it
is
for
you
to
say
which
of
us
is
to
get
it
suppose
we
run
over
to
the
powhatan
and
discuss
the
matter
calmly
over
a
bottle
of
glengarry
possibly
i
can
convince
you
that
it
will
be
for
your
own
good
to
do
precisely
as
i
tell
you
and
very
much
to
your
disadvantage
to
do
otherwise
rand
stupefied
by
this
sudden
intrusion
upon
his
secret
by
an
utter
stranger
lost
what
little
fight
there
was
left
in
him
and
at
least
seemed
to
assent
to
holmes
proposition
the
latter
linked
arms
with
him
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
walked
into
the
famous
hostelry
just
as
if
we
were
three
friends
bent
only
upon
having
a
pleasant
chat
over
a
café
table
what
you
have
mr
rand
asked
holmes
suavely
i
elected
for
the
glengarry
special
with
a
little
carbonic
on
the
side
same
said
rand
laconically
sandwich
with
it
asked
holmes
you
better
oh
i
ca
eat
anything
began
rand
i
bring
us
some
sandwiches
waiter
said
holmes
two
glengarry
special
a
syphon
of
carbonic
and
jenkins
what
yours
the
calmness
and
the
cheek
of
the
fellow
i
not
in
on
this
at
all
i
retorted
angered
by
holmes
use
of
my
name
and
i
want
rand
to
understand
oh
tutt
ejaculated
holmes
knows
that
rand
my
friend
jenkins
has
no
connection
with
this
enterprise
of
mine
and
he
done
his
level
best
to
dissuade
me
from
holding
you
up
so
summarily
all
he
along
for
is
to
write
the
thing
up
for
the
newspapers
cried
rand
now
thoroughly
frightened
no
laughed
holmes
nothing
so
useful
the
magazines
holmes
winked
at
me
as
he
spoke
and
i
gathered
that
there
was
method
in
his
apparent
madness
that
one
of
the
points
you
want
to
consider
though
rand
he
said
leaning
upon
the
table
with
his
elbows
think
of
the
newspapers
morning
if
you
call
the
police
rather
than
hand
that
package
over
to
me
it
be
a
big
sensation
for
wall
street
and
upper
fifth
avenue
to
say
nothing
of
what
the
yellows
will
make
of
the
story
for
the
rest
of
hoi
polloi
the
newsboys
will
be
yelling
extras
all
over
town
printed
in
great
red
letters
in
broad
daylight
for
in
securities
that
did
belong
to
him
billington
rand
has
something
to
explain
where
did
he
get
it
for
heavens
sake
man
do
pleased
the
unfortunate
billington
god
i
never
thought
of
that
of
course
you
did
think
of
that
said
holmes
that
why
i
telling
you
about
it
now
you
do
dispute
my
facts
do
you
no
i
rand
began
of
course
not
said
holmes
you
might
as
well
dispute
the
existence
of
the
building
if
you
do
want
papers
to
be
full
of
this
thing
you
hand
that
package
over
to
me
but
protested
rand
i
only
taking
them
up
to
to
a
er
to
a
broker
here
he
gathered
himself
together
and
spoke
with
greater
assurance
i
am
delivering
them
sir
to
a
broker
on
behalf
of
one
of
our
depositors
who
who
has
been
speculating
with
what
little
money
he
had
left
has
lost
his
margins
and
is
now
forced
into
an
act
of
crime
to
protect
his
speculation
said
holmes
the
broker
is
the
notorious
william
gallagher
who
runs
an
for
speculative
ladies
to
lose
their
and
bridge
winnings
in
and
your
depositor
name
is
billington
rand
otherwise
yourself
how
do
you
know
all
this
gasped
rand
oh
maybe
i
read
it
on
the
ticker
laughed
holmes
or
what
is
more
likely
possibly
i
overheard
gallagher
recommending
you
to
dip
into
the
bank
collateral
to
save
your
investment
at
green
last
night
you
were
at
green
last
night
cried
rand
in
the
booth
adjoining
your
own
and
i
heard
every
word
you
said
said
holmes
well
i
do
see
why
i
should
give
the
stuff
to
you
anyhow
growled
rand
chiefly
because
i
happen
to
be
long
on
information
which
would
be
of
interest
not
only
to
the
police
but
to
the
president
and
board
of
directors
of
the
kenesaw
national
back
rand
said
holmes
it
will
be
a
simple
matter
for
me
to
telephone
horace
huntington
the
president
of
your
institution
and
put
him
wise
to
this
transaction
of
yours
and
that
is
the
second
thing
i
shall
do
immediately
you
have
decided
not
to
part
with
that
package
the
second
thing
rand
whimpered
what
will
you
do
first
communicate
with
the
first
policeman
we
meet
when
we
leave
here
said
holmes
but
take
your
time
rand
take
your
time
do
let
me
hurry
you
into
a
decision
try
a
little
of
this
glengarry
and
we
drink
hearty
to
a
sensible
conclusion
i
i
put
them
back
in
the
vaults
pleaded
rand
ca
trust
you
my
boy
said
holmes
not
with
a
persuasive
crook
like
old
gallagher
on
your
trail
they
safer
with
me
rand
answer
was
a
muttered
oath
as
he
tossed
the
package
across
the
table
and
started
to
leave
us
one
word
more
rand
said
holmes
detaining
him
do
do
anything
rash
there
a
lot
of
between
criminals
and
i
stand
by
you
all
right
so
far
nobody
knows
you
took
these
things
and
even
when
they
turn
up
missing
if
you
go
about
your
work
as
if
nothing
had
happened
while
you
may
be
suspected
nobody
can
that
you
got
the
goods
rand
face
brightened
at
this
remark
by
jove
that
true
enough
said
he
excepting
gallagher
he
added
his
face
falling
pah
for
gallagher
cried
holmes
snapping
his
fingers
contemptuously
if
he
as
much
as
peeped
we
could
put
him
in
jail
and
if
he
sells
you
out
you
tell
him
for
me
that
i
land
him
in
sing
sing
for
a
term
of
years
he
led
you
into
this
he
certainly
did
moaned
rand
and
he
got
to
get
you
out
said
holmes
now
old
man
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
you
is
a
few
judgments
instead
of
penal
servitude
for
eight
or
ten
years
unless
you
are
foolish
enough
to
try
another
turn
of
this
sort
and
then
you
may
not
happen
on
a
highwayman
like
myself
to
get
you
out
of
your
troubles
what
is
the
combination
of
the
big
safe
in
the
outer
office
of
the
kenesaw
national
said
rand
thanks
said
holmes
jotting
it
down
coolly
in
his
that
a
good
thing
to
know
that
night
shortly
before
midnight
holmes
left
me
i
got
to
finish
this
job
said
he
the
most
ticklish
part
of
the
business
is
yet
to
come
great
scott
holmes
i
cried
is
the
thing
done
no
of
course
not
he
replied
i
got
to
bust
open
the
kenesaw
safe
now
my
dear
raffles
i
began
why
are
you
satisfied
with
what
done
already
why
must
you
shut
up
jenkins
he
interrupted
with
a
laugh
if
you
knew
what
i
was
going
to
do
you
would
kick
that
is
unless
you
turned
crook
too
not
i
said
i
indignantly
you
do
expect
me
to
keep
these
bonds
do
you
he
asked
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
i
retorted
put
back
in
the
kenesaw
bank
where
they
belong
so
that
they
be
found
there
morning
as
sure
as
i
do
billington
rand
is
doomed
said
he
it
a
tough
job
but
i
been
paid
a
thousand
dollars
by
his
family
to
find
out
what
he
up
to
and
by
thunder
after
following
his
trail
for
three
weeks
i
got
such
a
liking
for
the
boy
that
i
going
to
save
him
if
it
can
be
done
and
if
there
any
raffles
left
in
me
such
a
simple
proposition
as
cracking
a
bank
and
puting
the
stuff
back
where
it
belongs
in
a
safe
of
which
i
have
the
combination
is
going
to
stand
in
my
way
do
fret
old
man
it
as
good
as
done
and
raffles
holmes
was
off
i
passed
a
feverish
night
but
at
five
the
following
morning
a
telephone
message
set
all
my
misgivings
at
rest
hello
jenkins
came
raffles
voice
over
the
wire
hello
i
replied
just
rang
you
up
to
let
you
know
that
it
all
right
the
stuff
replaced
easiest
job
ever
like
opening
oysters
pleasant
dreams
to
you
he
said
and
click
the
connection
was
broken
two
weeks
later
billington
rand
resigned
from
the
kenesaw
bank
and
went
west
where
he
is
now
leading
the
simple
life
on
a
his
resignation
was
accepted
with
regret
and
the
board
of
directors
as
a
special
mark
of
their
liking
voted
him
a
gift
of
for
faithful
services
and
the
best
part
of
it
was
said
holmes
when
he
told
me
of
the
young
man
good
fortune
that
his
accounts
were
as
straight
as
a
string
holmes
you
are
a
bully
chap
i
cried
in
a
sudden
excess
of
enthusiasm
you
do
things
for
nothing
sometimes
nothing
echoed
holmes
nothing
why
that
job
was
worth
a
million
dollars
to
me
jenkins
but
not
in
coin
just
in
good
solid
satisfaction
in
saving
a
fine
young
chap
like
billington
rand
from
the
clutches
of
a
sharper
and
sneaking
skinflint
like
old
gallagher
viii
the
nostalgia
of
nervy
jim
the
snatcher
raffles
holmes
was
unusually
thoughtful
the
other
night
when
he
entered
my
apartment
and
for
a
long
time
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
save
an
occasional
grunt
of
assent
or
dissent
from
propositions
advanced
by
myself
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
was
cogitating
deeply
over
some
problem
that
was
more
than
ordinarily
vexatious
so
i
finally
gave
up
all
efforts
at
conversation
pushed
the
cigars
closer
to
him
poured
him
out
a
stiff
dose
of
his
favorite
glengarry
and
returned
to
my
own
work
it
was
a
full
hour
before
he
volunteered
an
observation
of
any
kind
and
then
he
plunged
rapidly
into
a
very
remarkable
tale
i
had
a
singular
adventure
jenkins
he
said
do
you
happen
to
have
in
your
set
of
my
father
adventures
a
portrait
of
sherlock
holmes
yes
i
have
i
replied
but
you
do
need
anything
of
the
kind
to
refresh
your
memory
of
him
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
and
you
got
the
photograph
before
you
i
so
like
him
then
he
queried
most
of
the
time
old
man
i
am
glad
to
say
said
i
there
are
days
when
you
are
the
living
image
of
your
grandfather
raffles
but
that
is
only
when
you
are
planning
some
scheme
of
villany
i
can
almost
invariably
detect
the
trend
of
your
thoughts
by
a
glance
at
your
face
you
are
holmes
himself
in
your
honest
moments
raffles
at
others
for
the
past
week
it
has
delighted
me
more
than
i
can
say
to
find
you
a
of
your
splendid
father
with
naught
to
suggest
your
fascinating
but
vicious
granddad
that
what
i
wanted
to
find
out
i
had
evidence
of
it
this
afternoon
on
broadway
said
he
it
was
bitterly
cold
up
around
fortieth
street
snowing
like
the
devil
and
such
winds
as
you
expect
to
find
nowhere
this
side
of
greenland
icy
mountains
i
came
out
of
a
broadway
and
started
north
when
i
was
stopped
by
an
specimen
of
humanity
who
begged
me
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
give
him
a
drink
the
poor
condition
was
such
that
it
would
have
been
manslaughter
to
refuse
him
and
a
moment
later
i
had
him
before
the
skidmore
bar
gurgling
down
a
tumblerful
of
raw
brandy
as
though
it
were
water
he
wiped
his
mouth
on
his
sleeve
and
turned
to
thank
me
when
a
look
of
recognition
came
into
his
face
and
he
staggered
back
half
in
fear
and
half
in
amazement
holmes
he
cried
i
said
i
calmly
my
curiosity
much
excited
or
his
twin
said
he
should
you
know
me
i
asked
reason
enough
he
muttered
sherlock
holmes
as
landed
me
for
ten
years
in
reading
gaol
my
friend
i
answered
no
doubt
you
deserved
it
if
he
did
it
i
am
sherlock
holmes
however
but
his
son
you
let
me
take
you
by
the
hand
governor
he
whispered
hoarsely
for
the
kindness
you
shown
me
here
but
for
the
service
your
old
man
did
me
i
am
nervy
jim
the
snatcher
said
i
with
a
laugh
consider
it
a
service
to
be
landed
in
reading
gaol
was
the
only
happy
years
i
ever
had
sir
he
answered
impetuously
keepers
was
good
to
me
i
was
well
fed
kept
workin
hard
at
an
honest
job
pickin
oakum
the
gaol
was
warm
and
i
never
went
to
bed
by
night
or
got
up
o
mornin
worried
over
the
question
o
how
i
was
goin
to
get
the
swag
to
pay
my
rent
compared
to
this
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
at
the
raging
of
the
elements
along
broadway
gaol
was
heaven
sir
and
since
i
was
discharged
i
been
a
helpless
hopeless
wanderer
sleepin
in
doorways
chilled
to
the
bone
with
not
a
friendly
eye
in
sight
and
nothin
to
do
all
day
long
and
all
night
long
but
move
on
when
the
bobbies
tell
me
to
and
think
about
the
happiness
i
left
behind
me
when
i
left
reading
was
you
ever
homesick
governor
i
confessed
to
an
occasional
feeling
of
nostalgia
for
old
picadilly
and
the
thames
you
know
says
he
i
feels
now
in
a
strange
land
dreamin
of
my
comfortable
little
cell
at
reading
the
good
meals
the
pleasant
keepers
and
a
steady
job
with
nothin
to
worry
about
for
ten
short
years
i
want
to
go
back
governor
i
want
to
go
back
well
said
holmes
lighting
a
cigar
i
was
pretty
nearly
floored
but
when
the
door
of
the
saloon
blew
open
and
a
blast
of
sharp
air
and
a
furry
of
snow
came
in
i
could
blame
the
poor
beggar
certainly
any
place
in
the
world
even
a
jail
was
more
comfortable
than
broadway
at
that
moment
i
explained
to
him
however
that
as
far
as
reading
gaol
was
concerned
i
was
powerless
to
help
him
there
just
as
good
prisons
here
ai
there
governor
he
pleaded
yes
said
i
laughing
at
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
sing
is
a
penitentiary
with
all
modern
improvements
and
a
pretty
select
clientele
you
put
me
in
there
governor
he
asked
wistfully
do
anything
you
ask
short
o
murder
governor
if
you
only
will
do
you
get
yourself
arrested
as
a
vagrant
i
asked
give
you
three
months
on
blackwell
island
and
will
tide
you
over
the
winter
permanent
governor
he
objected
the
end
o
three
months
be
out
and
have
to
begin
all
over
again
what
i
want
is
something
i
can
count
on
for
ten
or
twenty
years
besides
i
has
some
pride
governor
and
for
nervy
jim
to
do
three
months
time
lor
sir
i
could
bring
myself
to
nothin
so
small
there
was
no
resisting
the
poor
cuss
jenkins
and
i
promised
to
do
what
i
could
for
him
that
a
nice
job
said
i
what
can
you
do
that
what
stumps
me
said
raffles
holmes
scratching
his
head
in
perplexity
i
set
him
up
in
a
small
tenement
down
on
east
houston
street
temporarily
and
meanwhile
it
up
to
me
to
land
him
in
sing
sing
where
he
can
live
comfortably
for
a
decade
or
so
and
i
hanged
if
i
know
how
to
do
it
he
used
to
be
a
man
and
in
his
day
was
an
snatcher
as
his
name
signifies
and
my
father
diaries
attest
but
afraid
his
hand
is
out
for
a
nice
job
such
as
i
would
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
myself
better
let
him
slide
raffles
said
i
he
introduces
the
third
party
element
into
our
arrangement
and
that
mighty
dangerous
true
but
consider
the
literary
value
of
a
chap
that
homesick
for
jail
he
answered
persuasively
i
do
know
but
i
think
he
new
ah
the
insidious
appeal
of
that
man
he
knew
the
crack
in
my
armor
and
with
neatness
and
despatch
he
pierced
it
and
i
fell
well
i
demurred
good
said
he
we
consider
it
arranged
i
fix
him
out
in
a
week
holmes
left
me
at
this
point
and
for
two
days
i
heard
nothing
from
him
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
he
telephoned
me
to
meet
him
at
the
of
the
metropolitan
at
four
bring
your
voice
with
you
said
he
enigmatically
we
may
need
it
an
immediate
explanation
of
his
meaning
was
impossible
for
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
cut
the
connection
i
wanted
to
excite
your
curiosity
so
that
you
would
be
sure
to
come
he
laughed
when
i
asked
his
meaning
later
you
and
i
are
going
to
join
conried
selected
chorus
of
educated
persons
who
want
to
earn
their
grand
opera
instead
of
paying
five
dollars
a
performance
for
it
and
so
we
did
although
i
objected
a
little
at
first
i
ca
sing
said
i
of
course
you
ca
said
he
if
you
could
you
would
go
into
the
chorus
but
do
bother
about
that
i
have
a
slight
pull
here
and
we
can
get
in
all
right
as
long
as
we
are
moderately
intelligent
and
enough
to
carry
a
spear
in
musical
circles
my
name
is
dickson
do
forget
that
that
holmes
had
a
pull
was
shortly
proven
for
although
neither
of
us
was
more
than
ordinarily
gifted
vocally
we
proved
acceptable
and
in
a
short
time
found
ourselves
enrolled
among
the
supernumeraries
who
make
of
lohengrin
a
splendid
spectacle
to
the
eye
i
found
real
zest
in
life
carrying
that
spear
and
entered
into
the
spirit
of
what
i
presumed
to
be
a
mere
frolic
with
enthusiasm
merely
for
the
experience
of
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
delight
i
took
in
the
superb
music
which
i
have
always
loved
and
then
the
eventful
night
came
it
was
monday
and
the
house
was
packed
on
both
sides
of
the
curtain
everything
was
brilliant
the
cast
was
one
of
the
best
and
the
audience
all
that
the
new
york
audience
is
noted
for
in
wealth
beauty
and
social
prestige
and
in
the
matter
of
jewels
of
lavish
display
conspicuous
in
respect
to
the
last
was
the
though
somewhat
eccentric
who
in
her
box
fairly
scintillated
with
those
marvellous
gems
which
gave
her
as
a
musical
critic
whose
notes
on
the
opera
were
chiefly
confined
to
observations
on
its
social
aspects
put
it
the
appearance
of
being
lit
up
by
electricity
even
from
where
i
stood
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
mock
king
court
on
the
stage
i
could
see
the
rubies
and
sapphires
and
diamonds
loom
large
upon
the
horizon
as
the
read
white
and
blue
emblem
of
our
national
greatness
to
the
truly
patriotic
soul
little
did
i
dream
as
i
stood
in
the
rear
line
of
the
court
clad
in
all
the
gorgeous
regalia
of
a
vocal
supernumerary
and
swelling
the
noisy
welcome
to
the
advancing
lohengrin
with
my
apology
for
a
voice
how
intimately
associated
with
these
lustrous
headlights
i
was
soon
to
be
and
as
raffles
holmes
and
i
poured
out
our
souls
in
song
not
even
his
illustrious
father
would
have
guessed
that
he
was
there
upon
any
other
business
than
that
of
conried
as
far
as
i
could
see
raffles
was
wrapt
in
the
music
of
the
moment
and
not
once
to
my
knowledge
did
he
seem
to
be
aware
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
an
audience
much
less
one
individual
member
of
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
footlights
like
a
member
of
the
old
choral
guard
he
went
through
the
work
in
hand
as
nonchalantly
as
though
it
were
his
regular
business
in
life
it
was
during
the
intermission
between
the
first
and
second
acts
that
i
began
to
suspect
that
there
was
something
in
the
wind
beside
music
for
holmes
face
became
set
and
the
resemblance
to
his
honorable
father
which
had
of
late
been
so
marked
seemed
to
dissolve
itself
into
an
unpleasant
suggestion
of
his
other
forbear
the
acquisitive
raffles
my
own
enthusiasm
for
our
operatic
experience
which
i
took
no
pains
to
conceal
found
no
response
in
him
and
from
the
fall
of
the
curtain
on
the
first
act
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
he
were
trying
to
avoid
me
so
marked
indeed
did
this
desire
to
hold
himself
aloof
become
that
i
resolved
to
humor
him
in
it
and
instead
of
clinging
to
his
side
as
had
been
my
wont
i
let
him
go
his
own
way
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
he
disappeared
i
did
not
see
him
again
until
the
long
passage
between
ortrud
and
telrammund
was
on
when
in
the
of
the
stage
i
caught
sight
of
him
hovering
in
the
vicinity
of
the
electric
by
which
the
lights
of
the
house
are
controlled
suddenly
i
saw
him
reach
out
his
hand
quickly
and
a
moment
later
every
went
out
leaving
the
auditorium
in
darkness
relieved
only
by
the
lighting
of
the
stage
almost
immediately
there
came
a
succession
of
shrieks
from
the
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
box
and
i
knew
that
something
was
afoot
only
a
slight
commotion
in
the
audience
was
manifest
to
us
upon
the
stage
but
there
was
a
hurrying
and
scurrying
of
ushers
and
others
of
greater
or
less
authority
until
finally
the
flashed
out
again
in
all
their
illumination
the
progress
of
the
opera
was
not
interrupted
for
a
moment
but
in
that
brief
interval
of
blackness
at
the
rear
of
the
house
some
one
had
had
time
to
force
his
way
into
the
jones
box
and
snatch
from
the
neck
of
its
fair
occupant
that
wondrous
necklace
of
matchless
rubies
that
had
won
the
admiring
regard
of
many
beholders
and
the
envious
interest
of
not
a
few
three
hours
later
raffles
holmes
and
i
returned
from
the
days
and
dress
of
lohengrin
time
to
affairs
of
and
when
we
were
seated
in
my
apartment
along
about
two
in
the
morning
holmes
lit
a
cigar
poured
himself
out
a
liberal
dose
of
glengarry
and
with
a
quiet
smile
leaned
back
in
his
chair
well
he
said
what
about
it
you
have
the
floor
raffles
i
answered
was
that
your
work
one
end
of
it
said
he
it
went
off
like
poor
old
nervy
has
won
his
board
and
lodging
for
twenty
years
all
right
but
he
got
away
with
it
i
put
in
as
far
as
east
houston
street
holmes
observed
quietly
i
shall
take
up
the
case
track
nervy
to
his
lair
secure
necklace
return
it
to
the
lady
and
within
three
weeks
the
snatcher
will
take
up
his
abode
on
the
banks
of
the
hudson
the
only
banks
the
ordinary
cracksman
is
anxious
to
avoid
but
how
the
dickens
did
you
manage
to
put
a
crook
like
that
on
the
tier
floor
i
demanded
jenkins
what
a
child
you
are
laughed
holmes
how
did
i
get
him
there
why
i
set
him
up
with
a
box
of
his
own
directly
above
the
box
you
can
always
get
one
for
a
single
performance
if
you
are
willing
to
pay
for
it
and
with
a
fair
expanse
of
a
and
a
crush
hat
almost
any
man
who
has
any
style
to
him
at
all
these
days
can
pass
for
a
gentleman
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
go
to
the
present
his
ticket
walk
in
and
await
the
signal
i
gave
the
man
his
music
cue
and
two
minutes
before
the
lights
went
out
he
sauntered
down
the
broad
staircase
to
the
door
of
the
box
and
was
ready
to
turn
the
trick
he
was
under
cover
of
darkness
long
enough
to
get
away
with
the
necklace
and
when
the
lights
came
back
if
you
had
known
enough
to
look
out
into
the
auditorium
you
would
have
seen
him
back
there
in
his
box
above
taking
in
the
situation
as
calmly
as
though
he
had
himself
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
and
how
shall
you
trace
him
i
demanded
is
that
going
to
be
a
little
dangerous
not
if
he
followed
out
my
instructions
said
holmes
if
he
dropped
a
letter
addressed
to
himself
in
his
own
at
his
east
houston
street
lair
in
the
little
anteroom
of
the
box
as
i
told
him
to
do
have
all
the
clews
we
need
to
run
him
to
earth
but
suppose
the
police
find
it
i
asked
they
wo
laughed
holmes
they
spend
their
time
looking
for
some
impecunious
member
of
the
smart
set
who
might
have
done
the
job
they
always
try
to
find
the
sensational
clew
first
and
by
day
after
morning
four
or
five
poor
but
honest
members
of
the
will
find
when
they
read
the
morning
papers
that
they
are
under
surveillance
while
i
knowing
exactly
what
has
happened
will
have
all
the
start
i
need
i
have
already
offered
my
services
and
by
ten
morning
they
will
be
accepted
as
will
also
those
of
half
a
hundred
other
detectives
professional
and
amateur
at
eleven
i
will
visit
the
where
i
expect
to
find
the
incriminating
letter
on
the
floor
or
if
the
cleaning
women
have
already
done
their
work
which
is
very
doubtful
i
will
find
it
later
among
the
sweepings
of
waste
paper
in
the
cellar
of
the
accompanied
by
two
men
from
headquarters
i
will
then
proceed
to
nervy
quarters
and
if
he
is
really
sincere
in
his
desire
to
go
to
jail
for
a
protracted
period
we
shall
find
him
there
giving
an
imitation
of
a
gloat
over
his
booty
and
suppose
the
incriminating
letter
is
not
there
i
asked
he
may
have
changed
his
mind
i
have
arranged
for
that
said
holmes
with
a
quick
steely
glance
at
me
i
got
a
duplicate
letter
in
my
pocket
now
if
he
did
drop
it
i
will
but
nervy
jim
was
honest
at
least
in
his
desire
for
a
permanent
residence
in
an
penitentiary
for
even
as
the
deed
itself
had
been
accomplished
with
a
precision
that
was
almost
automatic
so
did
the
work
yet
to
be
done
go
off
with
the
nicety
of
a
schedule
everything
came
about
as
holmes
had
predicted
even
to
the
action
of
the
police
in
endeavoring
to
fasten
the
crime
upon
an
inoffensive
and
somewhat
impecunious
social
dangler
whose
only
ambition
in
life
was
to
lead
a
cotillion
well
and
whose
sole
idea
of
how
to
get
money
under
false
pretences
was
to
make
some
old
maid
believe
that
he
loved
her
for
herself
alone
and
in
his
heart
scorned
her
wealth
even
he
profited
by
this
since
he
later
sued
the
editor
who
printed
his
picture
with
the
label
a
social
highwayman
for
libel
claiming
damages
of
and
then
settled
the
case
out
of
court
for
spot
cash
the
letter
was
found
on
the
floor
of
the
box
where
nervy
jim
had
dropped
it
holmes
and
his
men
paid
an
early
visit
at
the
east
houston
street
and
found
the
happy
snatcher
snoring
away
in
his
cot
with
a
smile
on
his
face
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
dreaming
he
was
back
in
a
nice
comfortable
jail
once
more
and
as
if
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
the
missing
necklace
hung
about
his
swarthy
neck
short
work
was
made
of
the
arrest
nervy
him
almost
embarrassingly
grateful
was
railroaded
to
sing
sing
in
ten
days
time
for
fifteen
years
and
raffles
holmes
had
the
present
pleasure
and
personal
satisfaction
of
restoring
the
lost
necklace
to
the
fair
hands
of
herself
look
at
that
jenkins
he
said
gleefully
when
the
thing
was
all
over
a
check
for
well
that
is
so
much
considering
the
value
of
the
necklace
said
i
that
the
funny
part
of
it
laughed
holmes
every
stone
in
it
was
paste
but
never
let
on
for
a
minute
she
paid
her
little
ten
thousand
rather
than
have
it
known
great
heavens
really
i
said
yes
said
holmes
replacing
the
check
in
his
she
almost
as
nervy
as
nervy
jim
himself
she
what
i
call
a
sport
ix
the
adventure
of
room
raffles
holmes
and
i
had
walked
together
it
was
a
beastly
cold
night
and
when
we
reached
the
hotel
powhatan
my
companion
suggested
that
we
stop
in
for
a
moment
to
thaw
out
our
frozen
cheeks
and
incidentally
warm
up
the
inner
man
with
some
one
of
the
spirituous
concoctions
for
which
that
hostelry
is
deservedly
famous
i
naturally
acquiesced
and
in
a
moment
we
sat
at
one
of
the
small
tables
in
the
combination
and
café
of
the
hotel
queer
place
this
said
holmes
gazing
about
him
at
the
motley
company
of
guests
it
is
the
gathering
place
of
the
noted
and
the
notorious
that
handsome
who
has
just
left
the
room
is
the
reverend
harkaway
possibly
the
most
eloquent
preacher
they
have
in
boston
at
the
table
over
in
the
corner
talking
to
that
lady
with
a
roasted
pheasant
on
her
head
in
place
of
a
hat
is
jack
mcbride
the
champion
of
the
northwest
and
by
thunder
jenkins
look
at
that
a
englishman
appeared
in
the
doorway
stood
a
moment
glanced
about
him
eagerly
and
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
turned
away
and
disappeared
in
the
throngs
of
the
corridor
without
there
something
doing
to
bring
baskingford
here
muttered
holmes
lord
baskingford
said
i
who
he
he
the
most
expert
diamond
lifter
in
london
answered
holmes
his
appearance
on
piccadilly
was
a
signal
always
to
scotland
yard
to
wake
up
and
to
the
jewellers
of
bond
street
to
lock
up
my
old
daddy
used
to
say
that
baskingford
could
scent
a
kohinoor
quicker
than
a
hound
a
fox
i
wonder
what
his
game
is
is
he
a
real
lord
i
asked
real
laughed
holmes
yes
he
a
real
lord
of
the
lifters
if
what
you
mean
but
if
you
mean
does
he
belong
to
the
peerage
no
his
real
name
is
bob
hollister
he
has
served
two
terms
in
pentonville
escaped
once
from
a
russian
prison
and
is
still
in
the
ring
he
never
idle
and
if
he
comes
to
the
powhatan
you
can
gamble
your
last
dollar
on
it
that
he
has
a
good
big
stake
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
we
must
look
over
the
list
of
arrivals
we
finished
our
drink
and
settled
the
score
holmes
sauntered
in
leisurely
fashion
out
into
the
office
and
leaning
easily
over
the
counter
inspected
the
register
got
any
real
live
dukes
in
the
house
mr
sommers
he
asked
of
the
clerk
not
holmes
laughed
the
clerk
we
rather
shy
on
the
nobility
the
nearest
we
come
to
anything
worth
while
in
that
line
is
a
baronet
sir
henry
darlington
of
dorsetshire
england
we
can
show
you
a
nice
line
of
captains
of
industry
however
thank
you
sommers
said
holmes
returning
the
laugh
i
trouble
you
fact
is
i
long
on
captains
of
industry
and
was
just
a
bit
hungry
for
a
dash
of
the
british
nobility
who
is
sir
henry
darlington
of
dorsetshire
england
you
can
search
me
said
the
clerk
i
too
busy
to
study
genealogy
but
there
a
man
here
who
knows
who
he
is
all
right
all
right
at
least
i
judge
so
from
his
manner
who
that
asked
holmes
himself
said
sommers
with
a
chuckle
now
your
chance
to
ask
him
for
there
he
goes
into
the
palm
room
we
glanced
over
in
the
direction
indicated
and
again
our
eyes
fell
upon
the
muscular
form
of
lord
baskingford
oh
said
holmes
well
he
is
a
pretty
fair
specimen
is
he
little
too
large
for
my
special
purpose
though
sommers
he
added
so
you
wrap
him
up
and
send
him
home
all
right
holmes
grinned
the
clerk
come
in
again
some
time
when
we
have
a
few
fresh
importations
in
and
maybe
we
can
fix
you
out
with
a
swift
glance
at
the
open
page
of
the
register
holmes
bade
the
clerk
and
we
walked
away
room
he
said
as
we
moved
along
the
corridor
room
we
forget
that
his
lordship
is
evidently
expecting
some
one
and
i
think
fool
around
for
a
while
and
see
what
in
the
wind
a
moment
or
two
later
we
came
face
to
face
with
the
baronet
and
watched
him
as
he
passed
along
the
great
hall
scanning
every
face
in
the
place
and
on
to
the
steps
leading
down
to
the
which
he
descended
he
anxious
all
right
said
holmes
as
we
sauntered
along
how
would
you
like
to
take
a
bite
jenkins
i
like
to
stay
here
and
see
this
out
very
good
said
i
i
find
it
interesting
so
we
proceeded
towards
the
palm
room
and
sat
down
to
order
our
repast
scarcely
were
we
seated
when
one
of
the
hotel
boys
resplendent
in
brass
buttons
strutted
through
between
the
tables
calling
aloud
in
a
shrill
voice
telegram
for
four
hundred
and
seven
telegram
that
the
number
raffles
i
whispered
excitedly
i
know
it
he
said
quietly
give
him
another
chance
telegram
for
number
four
hundred
and
seven
called
the
buttons
here
boy
said
holmes
nerving
himself
up
give
me
that
four
hundred
and
seven
sir
asked
the
boy
certainly
said
holmes
coolly
hand
it
over
any
charge
no
sir
said
the
boy
giving
raffles
the
yellow
covered
message
thank
you
said
holmes
tearing
the
flap
open
carelessly
as
the
boy
departed
and
just
then
the
fictitious
baronet
entered
the
room
and
as
holmes
read
his
telegram
passed
by
us
still
apparently
in
search
of
the
unattainable
little
dreaming
how
close
at
hand
was
the
explanation
of
his
troubles
i
was
on
the
edge
of
nervous
prostration
but
holmes
never
turned
a
hair
and
save
for
a
slight
tremor
of
his
hand
no
one
would
have
even
guessed
that
there
was
anything
in
the
wind
sir
henry
darlington
took
a
seat
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
that
accounts
for
his
uneasiness
said
holmes
tossing
the
telegram
across
the
table
i
read
slight
delay
will
meet
you
at
eight
with
the
goods
the
message
was
signed
cato
let
see
said
holmes
it
is
now
here
lend
me
your
jenkins
i
produced
the
desired
article
and
holmes
in
an
admirably
feigned
hand
added
to
the
message
the
words
at
the
abbey
lafayette
boulevard
safer
restored
it
in
amended
form
to
its
envelope
call
one
of
the
please
he
said
to
the
waiter
a
moment
later
a
second
buttons
appeared
this
is
for
me
boy
said
holmes
handing
the
message
back
to
him
better
take
it
to
the
office
very
good
sir
said
the
lad
and
off
he
went
a
few
minutes
after
this
incident
sir
henry
again
rose
impatiently
and
left
the
room
and
at
a
proper
distance
to
the
rear
holmes
followed
him
darlington
stopped
at
the
desk
and
observing
the
telegram
in
his
box
called
for
it
and
opened
it
his
face
flushed
as
he
tore
it
into
scraps
and
made
for
the
elevator
into
which
he
disappeared
he
nibbling
the
bait
all
right
said
holmes
gleefully
we
just
wait
around
here
until
he
starts
and
then
we
see
what
we
can
do
with
cato
this
is
quite
an
adventure
what
do
you
suppose
it
all
about
i
asked
i
do
know
any
more
than
you
do
jenkins
said
holmes
save
this
that
old
bob
hollister
is
playing
when
he
goes
on
to
a
job
as
elaborately
as
all
this
you
can
bet
your
last
dollar
that
the
game
runs
into
five
figures
and
like
a
loyal
subject
of
his
gracious
majesty
king
edward
vii
whom
may
the
lord
save
he
reckons
not
in
dollars
but
in
pounds
sterling
who
can
cato
be
i
wonder
i
asked
we
know
at
eight
said
holmes
i
intend
to
have
him
up
up
up
where
i
asked
in
darlington
rooms
where
else
demanded
holmes
in
four
hundred
and
seven
i
gasped
certainly
that
our
headquarters
is
it
he
grinned
now
see
here
raffles
i
began
shut
up
jenkins
he
answered
just
hang
on
to
your
nerve
but
suppose
darlington
turns
up
my
dear
boy
the
abbey
is
six
miles
from
here
and
he
wo
by
any
living
chance
get
back
before
ten
we
shall
have
a
good
two
hours
and
a
half
to
do
up
old
cato
without
any
interference
from
him
said
holmes
suppose
he
does
come
what
then
i
rather
doubt
if
sir
henry
darlington
of
the
hotel
powhatan
new
york
or
dorsetshire
england
would
find
it
altogether
pleasant
to
hear
a
few
reminiscences
of
bob
hollister
of
pentonville
prison
which
i
have
on
tap
he
kick
up
the
deuce
of
a
row
i
protested
very
doubtful
jenkins
said
raffles
i
sort
of
believe
he
be
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
when
he
finds
out
what
i
know
but
if
he
is
well
do
i
represent
law
and
order
and
holmes
displayed
a
detective
badge
which
he
wore
for
use
in
emergency
cases
pinned
to
the
inner
side
of
his
suspenders
as
he
spoke
darlington
reappeared
and
leaving
his
key
at
the
office
went
out
through
the
revolving
doorway
and
jumped
into
a
hansom
where
to
sir
asked
the
cabman
the
abbey
said
darlington
they
off
whispered
holmes
with
a
laugh
and
now
for
mr
cato
we
walked
back
through
the
office
and
as
we
passed
the
bench
upon
which
the
sat
raffles
stopped
before
the
lad
who
had
delivered
the
telegram
to
him
here
son
he
said
handing
him
a
quarter
run
over
to
the
and
get
me
a
copy
of
this
months
i
be
in
the
the
boy
went
off
on
his
errand
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
with
a
magazine
thanks
said
holmes
now
get
me
my
key
and
we
call
it
square
four
hundred
and
seven
sir
said
the
boy
with
a
smile
of
recognition
yep
said
holmes
laconically
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
pretended
to
read
gad
holmes
what
a
nerve
i
muttered
we
need
it
in
this
business
said
he
the
buttons
returned
and
delivered
the
key
of
sir
henry
apartment
into
the
hands
of
raffles
holmes
ten
minutes
later
we
sat
in
room
i
in
a
blue
funk
from
sheer
nervousness
raffles
holmes
as
imperturbable
as
the
rock
of
gibraltar
from
sheer
nerve
it
was
the
usual
style
of
hotel
room
with
bath
pictures
telephone
wardrobes
and
the
last
proved
to
be
the
main
point
of
interest
upon
our
arrival
it
was
littered
up
with
papers
of
one
sort
and
another
letters
bills
receipted
and
otherwise
and
a
large
assortment
of
railway
and
steamship
folders
he
knows
how
to
get
away
was
holmes
comment
on
the
latter
most
of
the
letters
were
addressed
to
sir
henry
darlington
in
care
of
bruce
watkins
brownleigh
bankers
same
old
game
laughed
holmes
as
he
read
the
superscription
the
most
conservative
in
new
york
it
amazing
how
such
institutions
issue
letters
indiscriminately
to
any
tom
dick
or
harry
who
comes
along
and
planks
down
his
cash
they
do
seem
to
realize
that
they
thereby
unconsciously
lend
the
glamour
of
their
own
respectability
and
credit
to
people
who
instead
of
travelling
abroad
should
be
locked
up
in
the
most
convenient
penitentiary
at
home
aha
holmes
added
as
he
ran
his
eye
over
some
of
the
other
documents
and
came
upon
a
receipted
bill
we
getting
close
to
it
jenkins
here
a
receipted
bill
from
bar
leduc
of
fifth
avenue
for
three
rings
one
diamond
necklace
a
ruby
pin
and
a
set
of
pearl
yes
said
i
but
what
is
there
suspicious
about
that
if
the
things
are
paid
for
precisely
laughed
holmes
they
paid
for
sir
henry
darlington
has
enough
working
capital
to
buy
all
the
credit
he
needs
with
bar
leduc
co
there
is
a
house
in
this
town
that
after
a
cash
transaction
of
that
kind
conducted
through
bruce
watkins
brownleigh
send
its
own
soul
up
on
approval
to
a
nice
member
of
the
british
aristocracy
like
sir
henry
darlington
we
on
the
trail
jenkins
we
on
the
trail
here
a
letter
from
bar
leduc
let
see
what
light
that
sheds
on
the
matter
holmes
took
a
letter
from
an
envelope
and
read
rapidly
sir
henry
darlington
care
of
bruce
watkins
and
so
forth
dear
sir
henry
we
are
having
some
difficulty
matching
the
pearls
they
are
of
unusual
quality
but
we
hope
to
have
the
necklace
ready
for
delivery
as
requested
on
wednesday
afternoon
at
the
office
of
bruce
watkins
and
so
forth
between
five
and
six
trusting
the
delay
will
not
and
so
forth
and
hoping
to
merit
a
continuance
of
your
valued
favors
we
beg
to
remain
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
that
it
said
holmes
it
a
necklace
that
cato
is
bringing
up
to
sir
henry
darlington
and
once
in
his
possession
it
sir
henry
for
some
place
on
one
of
these
folders
why
do
they
send
them
directly
here
i
inquired
it
is
better
for
darlington
to
emphasize
bruce
watkins
brownleigh
and
not
to
bank
to
much
on
the
hotel
powhatan
that
why
said
holmes
what
the
good
of
having
bankers
like
that
back
of
you
if
you
underscore
their
endorsement
anyhow
we
discovered
the
job
jenkins
day
is
wednesday
and
the
cato
has
to
deliver
and
referred
to
in
his
telegram
is
the
pearl
necklace
of
unusual
quality
hence
not
less
than
a
stake
at
this
point
the
telephone
bell
rang
hello
said
holmes
answering
immediately
and
in
a
voice
entirely
unlike
his
own
yes
what
oh
yes
ask
him
to
come
up
he
hung
up
the
receiver
put
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
lit
it
and
turned
to
me
it
cato
just
called
coming
up
said
he
i
wish
to
heavens
i
was
going
down
i
ejaculated
you
a
queer
duck
jenkins
grinned
holmes
here
you
are
with
a
front
seat
at
what
promises
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
shows
on
earth
a
real
live
melodrama
and
all
you
can
think
of
is
home
and
mother
brace
up
for
here
he
is
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
come
in
said
holmes
cheerily
a
tall
man
opened
the
door
and
entered
as
his
eye
fell
upon
us
he
paused
on
the
threshold
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
i
afraid
i
in
the
wrong
not
at
all
come
in
and
sit
down
said
holmes
cordially
that
is
if
you
are
our
friend
and
partner
cato
darlington
could
wait
could
wait
said
cato
nope
said
holmes
he
was
very
much
annoyed
by
the
delay
cato
you
see
he
on
bigger
jobs
than
this
puny
little
affair
of
bar
leduc
and
your
failure
to
appear
on
schedule
time
threw
him
out
pearls
are
the
only
chips
in
darlington
game
my
boy
well
i
could
help
it
said
cato
bar
leduc
messenger
did
get
down
there
until
five
minutes
of
six
why
should
that
have
kept
you
until
eight
said
holmes
i
got
a
few
side
jobs
of
my
own
growled
cato
that
what
darlington
imagined
said
holmes
and
i
do
envy
you
your
meeting
with
him
when
he
comes
in
he
a
cyclone
when
he
mad
and
if
you
got
a
cellar
handy
i
advise
you
to
get
it
ready
for
occupancy
where
the
stuff
in
here
said
cato
tapping
his
chest
well
observed
holmes
quietly
we
better
make
ourselves
easy
until
the
chief
returns
you
do
mind
if
i
write
a
letter
do
you
go
ahead
said
cato
do
mind
me
light
up
said
holmes
tossing
him
a
cigar
and
turning
to
the
table
where
he
busied
himself
for
the
next
five
minutes
apparently
in
writing
cato
smoked
away
in
silence
and
picked
up
holmes
copy
of
the
which
lay
on
the
bureau
and
shortly
became
absorbed
in
its
contents
as
for
me
i
had
to
grip
both
sides
of
my
chair
to
conceal
my
nervousness
my
legs
fairly
shook
with
terror
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
scratching
of
holmes
pen
was
becoming
unendurable
and
i
think
i
should
have
given
way
and
screamed
had
not
holmes
suddenly
risen
and
walked
to
the
telephone
directly
back
of
where
cato
was
sitting
i
must
ring
for
stamps
he
said
there
do
seem
to
be
any
here
darlington
getting
stingy
in
his
old
age
hello
he
called
but
without
removing
the
receiver
from
the
hook
hello
send
me
up
a
dollar
worth
of
stamps
thank
you
cato
read
on
but
in
a
moment
the
magazine
dropped
from
his
hand
to
the
floor
holmes
was
at
his
side
and
the
cold
muzzle
of
a
revolver
pressed
uncomfortably
against
his
right
temple
that
bureau
cover
quick
raffles
cried
sharply
to
me
what
are
you
doing
gasped
cato
his
face
turning
a
with
fear
another
sound
from
you
and
you
a
dead
one
said
holmes
you
see
what
i
doing
quickly
enough
twist
it
into
a
rope
jim
he
added
addressing
me
i
did
as
i
was
bade
with
the
linen
cover
snatching
it
from
the
bureau
and
a
second
later
we
had
cato
gagged
now
tie
his
hands
and
feet
with
those
curtain
cords
holmes
went
on
heavens
how
i
hated
the
job
but
there
was
no
drawing
back
now
we
had
gone
too
far
for
that
there
said
holmes
as
we
laid
our
victim
out
on
the
floor
tied
hand
and
foot
and
as
powerless
to
speak
as
though
he
had
been
born
deaf
and
dumb
we
just
rifle
your
chest
cato
and
stow
you
away
in
the
with
a
under
your
head
to
make
you
comfortable
and
bid
you
farewell
not
au
revoir
cato
but
just
plain
farewell
forever
the
words
were
hardly
spoken
before
the
deed
was
accomplished
tearing
aside
poor
cato
vest
and
raffles
placed
himself
in
possession
of
the
treasure
from
bar
leduc
after
which
we
lay
darlington
unhappy
confederate
at
full
length
in
the
tub
placed
a
under
his
head
to
mitigate
his
sufferings
locked
him
in
and
started
for
the
elevator
great
heavens
raffles
i
chattered
as
we
emerged
upon
the
street
what
will
be
the
end
of
this
it
awful
when
sir
henry
returns
i
wish
i
could
be
there
to
see
said
he
with
a
chuckle
i
guess
we
see
quick
enough
i
leave
town
said
i
nonsense
said
holmes
do
you
worry
i
put
a
quietus
on
sir
henry
darlington
leave
town
and
we
never
hear
from
him
again
that
is
not
in
this
matter
but
how
i
demanded
far
from
convinced
i
wrote
him
a
letter
in
which
i
said
will
find
your
treasure
in
the
laughed
holmes
and
will
drive
him
from
new
york
and
close
his
mouth
forever
i
observed
sarcastically
so
very
likely
no
jenkins
not
that
but
the
address
my
dear
boy
the
address
i
put
that
message
in
an
envelope
and
left
it
on
his
table
where
he
surely
see
it
the
first
thing
when
he
gets
back
addressed
to
hollister
diamond
merchant
cell
no
pentonville
prison
aha
said
i
my
doubts
clearing
likewise
said
holmes
it
is
a
delicate
intimation
to
sir
henry
darlington
that
somebody
is
on
to
his
little
game
and
he
evaporate
before
dawn
a
week
later
holmes
brought
me
a
magnificent
pearl
what
that
i
asked
your
share
of
the
swag
he
answered
i
returned
the
pearl
necklace
to
bar
leduc
with
a
full
statement
of
how
it
came
into
my
possession
they
rewarded
me
with
this
ruby
ring
and
that
holmes
held
up
his
right
hand
on
the
fourth
finger
of
which
glistened
a
brilliant
stone
worth
not
less
than
fifteen
hundred
dollars
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
i
wondered
what
you
were
going
to
do
with
the
necklace
i
said
so
did
i
for
three
days
said
holmes
and
then
when
i
realized
that
i
was
a
single
man
i
decided
to
give
it
up
if
i
had
a
wife
to
wear
a
necklace
well
i
a
little
afraid
the
raffles
side
of
my
nature
would
have
won
out
i
wonder
whatever
became
of
darlington
said
i
i
do
know
sommers
says
he
left
town
suddenly
that
same
wednesday
night
without
paying
his
bill
holmes
answered
and
cato
i
did
inquire
but
from
what
i
know
of
bob
hollister
i
am
rather
inclined
to
believe
that
cato
left
the
powhatan
by
way
of
the
front
window
or
possibly
out
through
the
plumbing
in
some
way
laughed
holmes
either
way
would
be
the
most
comfortable
under
the
circumstances
x
the
pepperpots
i
had
often
wondered
during
the
winter
whether
or
no
it
would
be
quite
the
proper
thing
for
me
to
take
my
friend
raffles
holmes
into
the
sacred
precincts
of
my
club
by
some
men
and
i
am
one
of
them
the
club
despite
the
bad
name
that
clubs
in
general
have
as
being
antagonistic
to
the
home
is
looked
upon
as
an
institution
that
should
be
guarded
almost
as
carefully
against
the
intrusion
of
improper
persons
as
is
one
own
habitat
and
while
i
should
never
have
admitted
for
a
moment
that
raffles
was
an
undesirable
chap
to
have
around
i
could
not
deny
that
in
view
of
certain
characteristics
which
i
knew
him
to
possess
the
propriety
of
taking
him
into
the
heraclean
was
seriously
open
to
question
my
doubts
were
set
at
rest
however
on
that
point
one
day
in
january
last
when
i
observed
seated
at
one
of
our
the
reverend
mulligatawnny
rector
of
saint
a
highly
esteemed
member
of
the
organization
who
had
with
him
no
less
a
person
than
merryman
the
railway
magnate
whose
exploits
in
wall
street
have
done
much
to
give
to
that
golden
highway
the
particular
kind
of
perfume
which
it
now
exudes
to
the
nostrils
of
people
of
sensitive
honor
surely
if
mulligatawnny
was
within
his
rights
in
having
merryman
present
i
need
have
no
misgivings
as
to
mine
in
having
raffles
holmes
at
the
same
table
the
predatory
instinct
in
his
nature
was
as
a
drop
of
water
in
the
sea
to
that
ocean
of
known
acquisitiveness
which
has
floated
merryman
into
his
high
place
in
the
world
of
finance
and
as
far
as
the
moral
side
of
the
two
men
was
considered
respectively
i
felt
tolerably
confident
that
the
recording
angel
would
show
a
larger
balance
on
the
right
side
to
the
credit
of
raffles
than
to
that
of
his
more
famous
contemporary
hence
it
was
that
i
decided
the
question
in
my
friend
favor
and
a
week
or
two
later
had
him
in
at
the
heraclean
for
luncheon
the
was
filled
with
the
usual
assortment
of
interesting
men
men
who
had
really
done
something
in
life
and
who
suffered
from
none
of
that
selfish
modesty
which
leads
some
of
us
to
hide
our
light
under
the
bushel
of
silence
there
was
the
honorable
poultry
tickletoe
the
historian
whose
articles
on
the
shoddy
quality
of
the
modern
panama
hat
have
created
such
a
stir
throughout
the
hat
trade
william
darlington
ponkapog
the
poet
whose
epic
on
the
reign
of
gold
is
one
of
the
longest
and
some
writers
say
the
thickest
in
the
english
language
james
whistleton
potts
the
eminent
portraitist
whose
limnings
of
his
patients
have
won
him
a
high
place
among
the
caricaturists
of
the
age
robert
dozyphrase
the
expatriated
american
novelist
now
of
london
whose
latest
volume
of
sketches
entitled
has
been
equally
the
delight
of
his
followers
and
the
despair
of
students
of
the
occult
and
what
is
more
to
the
purpose
of
our
story
carrington
cox
retired
these
gentlemen
with
others
of
equal
distinction
whom
i
have
not
the
space
to
name
were
discussing
with
some
degree
of
simultaneity
their
own
achievements
in
the
various
fields
of
endeavor
to
which
their
lives
had
been
devoted
they
occupied
the
large
which
has
for
many
a
year
been
the
point
of
contact
for
the
distinguished
minds
of
which
the
membership
of
the
heraclean
is
made
up
the
as
it
were
over
which
the
verbal
balls
of
discussion
have
for
so
many
years
volleyed
to
the
delight
of
countless
listeners
raffles
and
i
sat
apart
at
one
of
the
smaller
tables
by
the
window
where
we
could
hear
as
much
of
the
conversation
at
the
larger
board
as
we
wished
so
many
members
of
the
heraclean
are
deaf
that
to
talk
loud
has
become
quite
de
rigueur
there
and
at
the
same
time
hold
converse
with
each
other
in
tones
best
suited
to
the
confidential
quality
of
our
communications
we
had
enjoyed
the
first
two
courses
of
our
repast
when
we
became
aware
that
general
carrington
cox
had
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
floor
and
as
he
proceeded
with
what
he
had
to
say
i
observed
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
conceal
the
fact
that
raffles
holmes
was
rather
more
deeply
interested
in
the
story
the
general
was
telling
than
in
such
chance
observations
as
i
was
making
hence
i
finished
the
luncheon
in
silence
and
even
as
did
holmes
listened
to
the
general
periods
and
they
were
as
usual
worth
listening
to
it
was
in
the
early
eighties
said
general
cox
i
was
informally
attached
to
the
spanish
legation
at
madrid
the
king
of
spain
alphonso
xii
was
about
to
be
married
to
the
highly
esteemed
lady
who
is
now
the
of
that
very
interesting
youth
alphonso
xiii
in
anticipation
of
the
event
the
city
was
in
a
fever
of
gayety
and
excitement
that
always
attends
upon
a
royal
function
of
that
nature
madrid
was
crowded
with
visitors
of
all
sorts
some
of
them
not
as
desirable
as
they
might
be
and
here
and
there
in
the
necessary
laxity
of
the
hour
one
or
two
perhaps
that
were
most
inimical
to
the
personal
safety
and
general
welfare
of
the
king
alphonso
like
many
another
royal
personage
was
given
to
the
old
haroun
al
raschid
habit
of
travelling
about
at
night
in
a
more
or
less
impenetrable
incognito
much
to
the
distaste
of
his
ministers
and
to
the
apprehension
of
the
police
who
did
not
view
with
any
too
much
satisfaction
the
possibility
of
disaster
to
the
royal
person
and
the
consequent
blame
that
would
rest
upon
their
shoulders
should
anything
of
a
serious
nature
befall
to
all
of
this
however
the
king
was
oblivious
and
it
so
happened
one
night
that
in
the
course
of
his
wanderings
he
met
with
the
long
dreaded
he
and
his
two
companions
fell
in
with
a
party
of
who
promptly
proceeded
to
hold
them
up
the
companions
were
speedily
put
out
of
business
by
the
attacking
party
and
the
king
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
very
serious
misadventure
the
least
issue
from
which
bade
fair
to
be
a
thorough
beating
if
not
an
attempt
on
his
life
it
was
at
the
moment
when
his
chances
of
escape
were
not
one
in
a
million
when
on
my
way
home
from
the
legation
where
i
had
been
detained
to
a
very
late
hour
i
came
upon
him
struggling
in
the
hands
of
four
as
nasty
ruffians
as
you
will
find
this
side
of
the
gallows
one
of
them
held
him
by
the
arms
another
was
giving
him
a
fairly
expert
imitation
of
how
it
feels
to
be
garroted
which
the
other
two
were
rifling
his
pockets
this
was
too
much
for
me
i
was
in
pretty
fit
physical
condition
at
that
time
and
felt
myself
to
be
quite
the
equal
in
a
good
old
fist
fight
of
any
dozen
ordinary
castilians
so
i
plunged
into
the
fray
heart
and
soul
not
for
an
instant
dreaming
however
what
was
the
quality
of
the
person
to
whose
assistance
i
had
come
my
first
step
was
to
bowl
over
the
garroter
expecting
no
interference
in
his
nefarious
pursuit
and
unwarned
by
his
companions
who
were
to
busily
engaged
in
their
adventure
of
loot
to
observe
my
approach
he
was
easy
prey
and
the
good
hard
whack
that
i
gave
him
just
under
his
right
ear
sent
him
flying
an
unconscious
mass
of
villanous
clay
into
the
gutter
the
surprise
of
the
onslaught
was
such
that
the
other
three
jumped
backward
thereby
releasing
the
king
arms
so
that
we
were
now
two
to
three
which
in
a
moment
became
two
to
two
for
i
lost
no
time
in
knocking
out
my
second
man
with
as
pretty
a
solar
plexus
as
you
ever
saw
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
more
demoralizing
than
a
good
solid
blow
straight
from
the
shoulder
to
chaps
whose
idea
of
fighting
is
to
sneak
up
behind
you
and
choke
you
to
death
or
to
stick
a
knife
into
the
small
of
your
back
and
had
i
been
far
less
expert
with
my
fists
i
should
still
have
had
an
incalculable
moral
advantage
over
such
riffraff
once
the
odds
in
the
matter
of
numbers
were
even
the
king
and
i
had
no
further
difficulty
in
handling
the
others
his
majesty
quarry
got
away
by
the
simple
act
of
taking
to
his
heels
and
mine
turning
to
do
likewise
received
a
salute
from
my
right
toe
which
if
i
am
any
judge
must
have
driven
the
upper
end
of
his
spine
up
through
the
top
of
his
head
left
alone
his
majesty
held
out
his
hand
and
thanked
me
profusely
from
my
timely
aid
and
asked
my
name
we
thereupon
bade
each
other
and
i
went
on
to
my
lodging
little
dreaming
of
the
service
i
had
rendered
to
the
nation
the
following
day
i
was
astonished
to
receive
at
the
legation
a
communication
bearing
the
royal
seal
commanding
me
to
appear
at
the
palace
at
once
the
summons
was
obeyed
and
upon
entering
the
palace
i
was
immediately
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
king
he
received
me
most
graciously
dismissing
however
all
his
attendants
cox
he
said
after
the
first
formal
greetings
were
over
rendered
me
a
great
service
last
night
your
majesty
said
i
what
way
putting
those
ruffians
to
flight
said
he
said
i
the
gentleman
attacked
was
one
of
your
friends
would
have
it
so
appear
said
the
king
a
great
many
reasons
i
should
prefer
that
it
were
not
known
that
it
was
i
your
majesty
i
cried
really
astonished
had
no
idea
are
discretion
itself
colonel
cox
laughed
the
king
to
assure
you
of
my
appreciation
of
the
fact
i
beg
that
you
will
accept
a
small
gift
which
you
will
some
day
shortly
receive
anonymously
it
will
not
be
at
all
commensurate
to
the
service
you
have
rendered
me
nor
to
the
discretion
which
you
have
already
so
kindly
observed
regarding
the
principals
involved
in
last
night
affair
but
in
the
spirit
of
friendly
interest
and
appreciation
back
of
it
it
will
be
of
a
value
inestimable
i
began
to
try
to
tell
his
majesty
that
my
government
did
not
permit
me
to
accept
gifts
of
any
kind
from
persons
royal
or
otherwise
but
it
was
not
possible
to
do
so
and
twenty
minutes
later
my
audience
was
over
and
i
returned
to
the
legation
with
the
uncomfortable
sense
of
having
placed
myself
in
a
position
where
i
must
either
violate
the
king
confidence
to
acquire
the
permission
of
congress
to
accept
his
gift
or
break
the
laws
by
which
all
who
are
connected
with
the
diplomatic
service
directly
or
indirectly
are
strictly
governed
i
assure
you
it
was
not
in
the
least
degree
in
the
hope
of
personal
profit
that
i
chose
the
latter
course
ten
days
later
a
pair
of
massive
golden
came
to
me
and
as
the
king
had
intimated
would
be
the
case
there
was
nothing
about
them
to
show
whence
they
had
come
taken
altogether
they
were
the
most
exquisitely
wrought
specimens
of
the
goldsmith
artistry
that
i
had
ever
seen
and
upon
their
under
side
was
inscribed
in
a
cipher
which
no
one
unfamiliar
with
the
affair
of
that
midnight
fracas
would
even
have
observed
to
alphonso
rex
to
carrington
cox
being
of
course
the
significance
thereof
they
were
put
away
with
my
other
belongings
and
two
years
later
when
my
activities
were
transferred
to
london
i
took
them
away
with
me
in
london
i
chose
to
live
in
chambers
and
was
soon
established
at
no
park
place
james
a
more
than
comfortable
and
centrally
located
where
i
found
pretty
much
everything
in
the
way
of
convenience
that
a
man
situated
as
i
was
could
reasonably
ask
for
i
had
not
been
there
more
than
six
months
however
when
something
happened
that
made
the
ease
of
apartment
life
seem
somewhat
less
desirable
that
is
my
rooms
were
broken
open
during
my
absence
over
night
on
a
little
canoeing
trip
to
henley
and
about
everything
valuable
in
my
possession
was
removed
including
the
truly
regal
sent
me
by
his
majesty
the
king
of
spain
that
i
had
carelessly
left
standing
upon
my
sideboard
until
last
week
the
general
continued
nor
hide
nor
hair
of
any
of
my
stolen
possessions
was
every
discovered
but
last
thursday
night
i
accepted
the
invitation
of
a
gentleman
well
known
in
this
country
as
a
leader
of
finance
a
veritable
captain
of
industry
the
soul
of
honor
and
one
of
the
most
genial
hosts
imaginable
i
sat
down
at
his
table
at
eight
and
will
you
believe
me
gentlemen
one
of
the
first
objects
to
greet
my
eye
upon
the
brilliantly
set
napery
was
nothing
less
than
one
of
my
lost
pots
there
was
no
mistaking
it
unique
in
pattern
it
was
certain
of
identification
anyhow
but
what
made
it
the
more
certain
was
the
cipher
to
and
of
course
you
claimed
it
asked
dozyphrase
of
course
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
retorted
the
general
i
trust
i
am
not
so
lacking
in
manners
i
merely
remarked
its
beauty
and
quaintness
and
massiveness
and
general
artistry
my
host
expressed
pleasure
at
my
appreciation
of
its
qualities
and
volunteered
the
information
that
it
was
a
little
thing
he
had
picked
up
in
a
curio
shop
on
regent
street
london
last
summer
he
had
acquired
it
in
perfect
good
faith
what
its
history
had
been
from
the
time
i
lost
it
until
then
i
am
not
aware
but
there
it
was
and
under
circumstances
of
such
a
character
that
although
it
was
indubitably
my
property
a
strong
sense
of
the
proprieties
prevented
me
from
regaining
its
possession
who
was
your
host
general
asked
tickletoe
the
general
laughed
that
telling
said
he
i
do
care
to
go
into
any
further
details
because
some
of
you
friends
of
mine
might
suggest
to
ahem
ha
well
never
mind
his
name
that
he
should
return
the
and
i
know
that
that
is
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
familiar
with
the
facts
that
i
have
just
narrated
it
was
at
about
this
point
that
the
gathering
broke
up
and
after
our
cigars
holmes
and
i
left
the
club
come
up
to
my
rooms
a
moment
said
raffles
as
we
emerged
upon
the
street
i
want
to
show
you
something
all
right
said
i
i
nothing
in
particular
to
do
this
afternoon
that
was
a
rather
interesting
tale
of
the
general
was
it
i
added
very
said
holmes
i
guess
it
not
an
uncommon
experience
however
in
these
days
for
the
and
to
be
in
possession
of
stolen
property
the
fact
of
its
turning
up
again
under
the
general
very
nose
so
many
years
later
however
that
is
unusual
the
case
will
appear
even
more
so
before
the
day
is
over
if
i
am
right
in
one
of
my
conjectures
what
raffles
holmes
conjecture
was
was
soon
to
be
made
clear
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
reached
his
apartment
and
there
unlocking
a
huge
chest
in
his
bedroom
he
produced
from
it
capacious
depths
another
gold
this
he
handed
to
me
there
the
mate
he
observed
quietly
by
jove
raffles
it
must
be
i
cried
for
beyond
all
question
in
the
woof
of
the
design
on
the
base
of
the
was
the
cipher
to
where
the
dickens
did
you
get
it
that
was
a
to
my
mother
he
explained
that
why
i
have
never
sold
it
not
even
when
i
been
on
the
edge
of
starvation
from
whom
do
you
happen
to
know
i
inquired
yes
he
replied
i
do
know
it
was
a
to
the
daughter
of
raffles
by
her
father
my
grandfather
raffles
himself
great
heavens
i
cried
then
it
was
raffles
who
well
you
know
that
london
flat
job
precisely
said
raffles
holmes
we
caught
the
old
gentleman
handed
well
i
be
jiggered
said
i
does
it
beat
creation
how
small
the
world
is
it
does
indeed
i
wonder
who
the
chap
is
who
has
the
other
raffles
observed
pretty
square
of
the
old
general
to
keep
quiet
about
it
said
i
yes
said
holmes
that
why
i
going
to
restore
this
one
i
wish
i
could
give
both
back
i
do
think
my
old
grandfather
would
have
taken
the
stuff
if
he
known
what
a
sport
the
old
general
was
and
i
sort
of
feel
myself
under
an
obligation
to
make
amends
you
can
send
him
the
one
you
got
through
the
express
companies
anonymously
said
i
no
said
holmes
the
general
left
them
on
his
sideboard
and
on
his
sideboard
he
must
find
them
if
we
could
only
find
out
the
name
of
his
host
last
thursday
i
tell
you
look
in
the
supplement
said
i
they
frequently
publish
short
paragraphs
of
the
social
doings
of
the
week
you
might
get
a
clew
there
good
idea
said
holmes
i
happen
to
have
it
here
too
there
was
an
article
in
it
last
sunday
giving
a
diagram
of
howard
vandergould
new
house
at
nippon
point
long
island
which
i
meant
to
cut
out
for
future
reference
holmes
secured
the
and
between
us
we
made
a
pretty
thorough
search
of
its
contents
especially
the
doings
of
society
columns
and
at
last
we
found
it
as
follows
a
small
dinner
of
thirty
was
given
on
thursday
evening
last
in
honor
of
and
wilbur
rattington
of
boston
by
rattington
brother
john
bruce
of
bruce
watkins
at
the
latter
residence
fifth
avenue
among
bruce
guests
were
and
dandervelt
and
elisha
scroog
carrington
cox
and
henderson
scovill
and
signor
caruso
old
bruce
eh
laughed
holmes
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
well
that
is
interesting
one
of
the
few
honest
railroad
bankers
in
the
country
a
pillar
of
the
church
a
leading
reformer
and
a
stolen
on
his
table
gee
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
asked
write
to
bruce
and
tell
him
the
facts
holmes
answer
was
a
glance
oh
he
ejaculated
with
profane
emphasis
a
week
after
the
incidents
just
described
he
walked
into
my
room
with
a
small
package
under
his
arm
there
the
pair
he
observed
unwrapping
the
parcel
and
displaying
its
contents
two
superb
golden
both
inscribed
to
beauties
are
they
they
are
indeed
did
bruce
give
it
up
willingly
i
asked
he
never
said
a
word
laughed
holmes
fact
is
he
snored
all
the
time
i
was
there
snored
said
i
yes
you
see
it
was
at
this
morning
said
holmes
and
i
went
in
the
back
way
climbed
up
to
the
extension
roof
in
through
bruce
bedroom
window
to
the
while
bruce
slept
unconscious
of
my
arrival
the
house
next
to
his
is
vacant
you
know
and
it
was
easy
travelling
you
you
i
began
yes
that
it
said
he
just
a
plain
vulgar
bit
of
business
and
i
got
it
there
were
a
lot
of
other
good
things
lying
around
he
added
with
a
gulp
but
well
i
was
righting
a
wrong
this
time
so
i
let
alone
and
barring
this
i
did
deprive
old
bruce
of
a
blooming
thing
not
even
a
wink
of
sleep
and
now
what
i
demanded
it
me
for
cedarhurst
that
where
the
general
lives
said
he
i
get
there
about
and
as
soon
as
all
is
quiet
jenkins
your
old
pal
raffles
holmes
will
climb
easily
up
to
the
piazza
gently
slide
back
the
bolts
of
the
french
windows
in
the
general
proceed
cautiously
to
the
sideboard
and
replace
thereon
these
two
souvenirs
of
a
brave
act
by
a
good
old
sport
whence
they
never
would
have
been
taken
had
my
grandfather
known
his
man
you
are
taking
a
terrible
risk
raffles
said
i
you
can
just
as
easily
send
the
tings
to
the
general
by
express
anonymously
jenkins
he
replied
that
suggestion
does
you
little
credit
and
appeals
neither
to
the
raffles
nor
to
the
holmes
in
me
pusillanimity
was
a
word
which
neither
of
my
forebears
could
ever
learn
to
use
it
was
too
long
for
one
thing
and
besides
that
it
was
never
needed
in
their
business
and
with
that
he
left
me
well
general
said
i
to
general
cox
a
week
later
at
the
club
heard
anything
further
about
your
yet
most
singular
thing
jenkins
said
he
the
d
d
things
turned
up
again
one
morning
last
week
and
where
the
devil
they
came
from
i
ca
imagine
one
of
them
however
had
a
piece
of
paper
in
it
on
which
was
written
with
thanks
for
their
use
and
apologies
for
having
kept
them
so
long
the
general
opened
his
wallet
and
handed
me
a
slip
which
he
took
from
it
there
it
is
what
in
thunder
do
you
make
out
of
it
he
asked
it
was
in
raffles
holmes
looks
to
me
as
though
bruce
also
had
been
robbed
i
laughed
bruce
who
the
devil
said
anything
about
bruce
demanded
the
general
why
did
you
tell
us
he
had
one
of
on
his
table
said
i
reddening
did
i
frowned
the
general
well
if
i
did
i
must
be
a
confounded
ass
i
thought
i
took
particular
pains
not
the
mention
bruce
name
in
the
matter
and
then
he
laughed
i
shall
have
to
be
careful
when
bruce
comes
to
dine
with
me
not
to
have
those
in
evidence
he
said
he
might
ask
embarrassing
questions
and
thus
it
was
that
raffles
holmes
atoned
for
at
least
one
of
the
offences
of
his
illustrious
grandsire
the
end
