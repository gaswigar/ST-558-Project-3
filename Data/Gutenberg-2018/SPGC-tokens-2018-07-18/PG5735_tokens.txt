chapter
i
in
the
summer
of
a
topsail
schooner
slipped
into
the
cove
under
trinidad
head
and
dropped
anchor
at
the
edge
of
the
fifteen
minutes
later
her
deposited
on
the
beach
a
man
armed
with
long
and
an
axe
and
carrying
food
and
clothing
in
a
brown
canvas
pack
from
the
beach
he
watched
the
boat
return
and
saw
the
schooner
weigh
anchor
and
stand
out
to
sea
before
the
northwest
trades
when
she
had
disappeared
from
his
ken
he
swung
his
pack
to
his
broad
and
powerful
back
and
strode
resolutely
into
the
timber
at
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
the
man
was
john
cardigan
in
that
lonely
hostile
land
he
was
the
first
pioneer
this
is
the
tale
of
cardigan
and
cardigan
son
for
in
his
chosen
land
the
pioneer
leader
in
the
gigantic
task
of
hewing
a
path
for
civilization
was
to
know
the
bliss
of
woman
love
and
of
parenthood
and
the
sorrow
that
comes
of
the
loss
of
a
perfect
mate
he
was
to
know
the
tremendous
joy
of
accomplishment
and
worldly
success
after
infinite
labour
and
in
the
sunset
of
life
he
was
to
know
the
dull
despair
of
failure
and
ruin
because
of
these
things
there
is
a
tale
to
be
told
the
tale
of
cardigan
son
who
when
his
sire
fell
in
the
fray
took
up
the
fight
to
save
his
heritage
a
tale
of
life
with
its
love
and
hate
its
battle
victory
defeat
labour
joy
and
sorrow
a
tale
of
that
unconquerable
spirit
of
youth
which
spurred
bryce
cardigan
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
for
the
sake
not
of
wealth
but
of
an
ideal
hark
then
to
this
tale
of
cardigan
redwoods
along
the
coast
of
california
through
the
secret
valleys
and
over
the
tumbled
foothills
of
the
coast
range
extends
a
belt
of
timber
of
an
average
width
of
thirty
miles
in
approaching
it
from
the
oregon
line
the
first
tree
looms
suddenly
against
the
horizon
an
outpost
as
it
were
of
the
host
of
giants
whose
column
stretches
south
nearly
four
hundred
miles
to
where
the
last
of
the
maintains
eternal
sentry
go
on
the
crest
of
the
mountains
overlooking
monterey
bay
far
in
the
interior
of
the
state
beyond
the
fertile
san
joaquin
valley
the
allies
of
this
vast
army
hold
a
small
sector
on
the
west
slope
of
the
sierras
these
are
the
redwood
forests
of
california
the
only
trees
of
their
kind
in
the
world
and
indigenous
only
to
these
two
areas
within
the
state
the
coast
timber
is
known
botanically
as
sequoia
sempervirens
that
in
the
interior
as
sequoia
gigantea
as
the
name
indicates
the
latter
is
the
larger
species
of
the
two
although
the
fibre
of
the
timber
is
coarser
and
the
wood
softer
and
consequently
less
valuable
commercially
than
the
sequoia
sempervirens
which
in
santa
cruz
san
mateo
marin
and
sonoma
counties
has
been
almost
wholly
logged
off
because
of
its
accessibility
in
northern
mendocino
humboldt
and
del
norte
counties
however
sixty
years
of
logging
seems
scarcely
to
have
left
a
scar
upon
this
vast
body
of
timber
notwithstanding
sixty
years
of
attrition
there
remain
in
this
section
of
the
redwood
belt
thousands
upon
thousands
of
acres
of
virgin
timber
that
had
already
attained
a
vigorous
growth
when
christ
was
crucified
in
their
vast
sombre
recesses
with
the
sunlight
filtering
through
their
branches
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
one
hears
no
sound
save
the
tremendous
diapason
of
the
silence
of
the
ages
here
more
forcibly
than
elsewhere
in
the
universe
is
one
reminded
of
the
littleness
of
man
and
the
glory
of
his
creator
in
sizes
ranging
from
five
to
twenty
feet
in
diameter
the
brown
trunks
rise
perpendicularly
to
a
height
of
from
ninety
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
before
putting
forth
a
single
limb
which
frequently
is
more
massive
than
the
growth
which
men
call
a
tree
in
the
forests
of
michigan
scattered
between
the
giants
like
subjects
around
their
king

or

with

black

and
cedar
in

and

when
the
twisted
and
cowering
madrone
trees
are
putting
forth
their
clusters
of
creamy
buds
when
the
white
blossoms
of
the
dogwoods
line
the
banks
of
little
streams
when
the
azaleas
and
rhododendrons
lovely
and
delicate
as
orchids
blaze
a
bed
of
glory
and
the
modest
little
oxalis
has
thrust
itself
up
through
the
brown
carpet
of
and
these
wonderful
forests
cast
upon
one
a
potent
spell
to
have
seen
them
once
thus
in
gala
dress
is
to
yearn
thereafter
to
see
them
again
and
still
again
and
grieve
always
in
the
knowledge
of
their
inevitable
death
at
the
hands
of
the
woodsman
john
cardigan
settled
in
humboldt
county
where
the
sequoia
sempervirens
attains
the
pinnacle
of
its
glory
and
with
the
lust
for
conquest
hot
in
his
blood
he
filed
upon
a
of
the
timber
almost
on
the
shore
of
humboldt
bay
land
upon
which
a
city
subsequently
was
to
be
built
with
his
axe
and
crosscut
saw
john
cardigan
brought
the
first
of
the
redwood
giants
crashing
to
the
earth
above
which
it
had
towered
for
twenty
centuries
and
in
the
form
of
split
posts
railroad
ties
pickets
and
shakes
the
fallen
giant
was
hauled
to
tidewater
in
wagons
and
shipped
to
san
francisco
in
the
little
coasting
schooners
of
the
period
here
by
the
abominable
magic
of
barter
and
trade
the
dismembered
tree
was
transmuted
into
dollars
and
cents
and
returned
to
humboldt
county
to
assist
john
cardigan
in
his
task
of
hewing
an
empire
out
of
a
wilderness
at
a
period
in
the
history
of
california
when
the
treasures
of
the
centuries
were
to
be
had
for
the
asking
or
the
taking
john
cardigan
chose
that
which
others
elected
to
cast
away
for
him
the
fertile
wheat
and
of
california
smiling
valleys
the
dull
placer
gold
in
her
streams
and
the
free
grass
knee
deep
on
her
cattle
and
held
no
lure
for
he
had
been
first
among
the
humboldt
redwoods
and
had
come
under
the
spell
of
the
vastness
and
antiquity
the
majesty
and
promise
of
these
epics
of
a
planet
he
was
a
big
man
with
a
great
heart
and
the
soul
of
a
dreamer
and
in
such
a
land
as
this
it
was
fitting
he
should
take
his
stand
in
that
wasteful
day
a
was
not
looked
upon
as
valuable
the
price
of
a
was
a
pittance
in
cash
and
a
brief
residence
in
a
cabin
constructed
on
the
claim
as
evidence
of
good
faith
to
a
government
none
too
exacting
in
the
restrictions
with
which
it
hedged
about
its
careless
dissipation
of
the
heritage
of
posterity
hence
because
redwood
were
easy
to
acquire
many
men
acquired
them
but
when
the
lure
of
greener
pastures
gripped
these
men
and
the
necessity
for
ready
money
oppressed
they
were
wont
to
sell
their
holdings
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
gradually
it
became
the
fashion
in
humboldt
to
unload
redwood
on
thrifty
visionary
john
cardigan
who
appeared
to
be
always
in
the
market
for
any
claim
worth
while
cardigan
was
a
shrewd
judge
of
stumpage
with
the
calm
certitude
of
a
prophet
he
looked
over
township
after
township
and
cunningly
checkerboarded
it
with
his
holdings
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
hillside
timber
is
the
best
john
cardigan
in
those
days
preferred
to
buy
valley
timber
for
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
the
timber
on
the
watersheds
should
become
available
he
knew
that
when
such
timber
should
be
cut
it
would
have
to
be
hauled
out
through
the
valleys
where
his
untouched
holdings
formed
an
impenetrable
barrier
to
the
exit
before
long
the
owners
of
timber
on
the
watersheds
would
come
to
realize
this
and
sell
to
john
cardigan
at
a
reasonable
price
time
passed
john
cardigan
no
longer
swung
an
axe
or
dragged
a
saw
through
a
fallen
redwood
he
was
an
employer
of
labour
now
well
known
in
san
francisco
as
a
manufacturer
of
products
the
purchasers
sending
their
own
schooners
for
the
cargo
and
presently
john
cardigan
mortgaged
all
of
his
timber
holdings
with
a
san
francisco
bank
made
a
heap
of
his
winnings
and
like
a
true
adventurer
staked
his
all
on
a
new
venture
the
first
sawmill
in
humboldt
county
the
timbers
for
it
were
hewed
out
by
hand
the
boards
and
planking
were
whipsawed
it
was
a
tiny
mill
judged
by
standards
for
in
a
working
day
john
cardigan
and
his
men
could
not
cut
more
than
twenty
thousand
feet
of
lumber
nevertheless
when
cardigan
looked
at
his
mill
his
great
heart
would
swell
with
pride
built
on
tidewater
and
at
the
mouth
of
a
large
slough
in
the
waters
of
which
he
stored
the
logs
his
cut
and
peeled
for
the
to
haul
with
down
a
vessels
could
come
to
mill
dock
to
load
and
lie
safely
in
twenty
feet
of
water
at
low
tide
also
this
dock
was
sufficiently
far
up
the
bay
to
be
sheltered
from
the
heavy
seas
that
rolled
in
from
humboldt
bar
while
the
level
land
that
stretched
inland
to
the
constituted
the
only
logical
townsite
on
the
bay
here
said
john
cardigan
to
himself
exultingly
when
a
wail
told
him
his
circular
saw
was
biting
into
the
first
redwood
log
to
be
milled
since
the
world
began
i
shall
build
a
city
and
call
it
sequoia
by
i
shall
have
cut
sufficient
timber
to
make
a
start
first
i
shall
build
for
my
employees
better
homes
than
the
rude
shacks
and
they
now
occupy
then
i
shall
build
myself
a
fine
residence
with
six
rooms
and
the
room
that
faces
on
the
bay
shall
be
the
parlour
when
i
can
afford
it
i
shall
build
a
larger
mill
employ
more
men
and
build
more
houses
i
shall
encourage
tradesmen
to
set
up
in
business
in
sequoia
and
to
my
city
i
shall
present
a
church
and
a
schoolhouse
we
shall
have
a
volunteer
fire
department
and
if
god
is
good
i
shall
at
a
later
date
get
out
some
and
build
a
schooner
to
freight
my
lumber
to
market
and
she
shall
have
three
masts
instead
of
two
and
carry
half
a
million
feet
of
lumber
instead
of
two
hundred
thousand
first
however
i
must
build
a
steam
tugboat
to
tow
my
schooner
in
and
out
over
humboldt
bar
and
after
that
ah
well
that
is
sufficient
for
the
chapter
ii
thus
did
john
cardigan
dream
and
as
he
dreamed
he
worked
the
city
of
sequoia
was
born
with
the
argonaut
mansion
of
rough
redwood
boards
and
a
dozen
cabins
with
kitchens
and
the
tradespeople
came
when
john
cardigan
with
something
of
the
largeness
of
his
own
redwood
trees
gave
them
ground
and
lumber
in
order
to
encourage
the
building
of
their
enterprises
also
the
dream
of
the
schoolhouse
and
the
church
came
true
as
did
the
steam
tugboat
and
the
schooner
with
three
masts
the
mill
was
enlarged
until
it
could
cut
forty
thousand
feet
on
a
shift
and
a
planer
and
machines
for
making
rustic
siding
and
flooring
and
ceiling
were
installed
more
appeared
upon
the
which
was
longer
now
the
cry
of
and
the
thunderous
roar
of
a
falling
redwood
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
forest
receded
from
the
bay
shore
and
at
last
the
whine
of
the
saws
silenced
these
sounds
forever
in
sequoia
at
forty
john
cardigan
was
younger
than
most
men
at
thirty
albeit
he
worked
fourteen
hours
a
day
slept
eight
and
consumed
the
remaining
two
at
his
meals
but
through
all
those
fruitful
years
of
toil
he
had
still
found
time
to
dream
and
the
spell
of
the
redwoods
had
lost
none
of
its
potency
he
was
still
the
forested
townships
with
his
adverse
holdings
the
to
the
timber
in
back
of
beyond
which
some
day
should
come
to
his
hand
also
he
had
competition
now
other
sawmills
dotted
the
bay
shore
other
schooners
carried
humboldt
redwood
to
the
world
beyond
the
bar
over
which
they
were
escorted
by
other
and
more
powerful
this
competition
john
cardigan
welcomed
and
enjoyed
however
for
he
had
been
first
in
humboldt
and
the
townsite
and
a
mile
of
tidelands
fronting
on
deep
water
were
his
hence
each
incoming
adventurer
merely
helped
his
dream
of
a
city
to
come
true
at
cardigan
was
the
first
mayor
of
sequoia
at
he
was
standing
on
his
dock
one
day
watching
his
tug
kick
into
her
berth
the
first
ship
that
had
ever
come
to
humboldt
bay
to
load
a
cargo
of
clear
redwood
for
foreign
delivery
she
was
a
big
clipper
and
her
master
a
lusty
a
widower
with
one
daughter
who
had
come
with
him
around
the
horn
john
cardigan
saw
this
girl
come
up
on
the
and
stand
by
with
a
in
her
hand
calmly
she
fixed
her
glance
upon
him
and
as
the
ship
was
shunted
in
closer
to
the
dock
she
made
the
cast
to
cardigan
he
caught
the
light
hauled
in
the
heavy
manila
to
which
it
was
attached
and
slipped
the
loop
of
the
over
the
dolphin
at
the
end
of
the
dock
some
men
wanted
aft
here
to
take
up
the
slack
of
the
on
the
windlass
sir
he
shouted
to
the
skipper
who
was
walking
around
on
top
of
the
house
that
girl
ca
haul
her
in
ca
i
the
skipper
replied
jump
aboard
and
help
cardigan
made
a
long
leap
from
the
dock
to
the
ship
rail
balanced
there
lightly
a
moment
and
sprang
to
the
deck
he
passed
the
bight
of
the
in
a
triple
loop
around
the
drum
of
the
windlass
and
without
awaiting
his
instructions
the
girl
grasped
the
slack
of
the
line
and
prepared
to
walk
away
with
it
as
the
rope
paid
in
on
the
windlass
cardigan
inserted
a
in
the
windlass
paused
and
looked
at
the
girl
raise
a
chantey
he
suggested
instantly
she
lifted
a
sweet
contralto
in
that
rollicking
old
ballad
of
the
sea
blow
the
men
for
tinkers
and
tailors
and
lawyers
and
all
way
aye
blow
the
men
down
they
ship
for
real
sailors
aboard
the
black
ball
give
me
some
time
to
blow
the
men
down
round
the
windlass
cardigan
walked
steadily
and
easily
and
the
eyes
widened
in
wonder
as
he
did
the
work
of
three
powerful
men
when
the
ship
had
been
warped
in
and
the
slack
of
the
line
made
fast
on
the
bitts
she
said
please
run
for
and
help
my
father
with
the
you
worth
three
foremast
hands
indeed
i
did
expect
to
see
a
sailor
on
this
i
had
to
come
around
the
horn
to
get
here
miss
he
explained
and
when
a
man
has
money
to
pay
for
his
passage
he
needs
must
work
i
the
second
mate
she
explained
we
had
a
succession
of
gales
from
the
falklands
to
the
evangelistas
and
there
the
mate
got
her
in
irons
and
she
took
three
big
ones
over
the
taffrail
and
cost
us
eight
men
working
we
could
get
any
canvas
on
her
to
speak
of
long
voyage
you
know
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
got
you
a
brave
girl
he
told
her
and
you
a
she
replied
if
you
looking
for
a
berth
my
father
will
be
glad
to
ship
sorry
but
i
ca
go
he
called
as
he
turned
toward
the
companion
ladder
i
cardigan
and
i
own
this
sawmill
and
must
stay
here
and
look
after
there
was
a
light
exultant
feeling
in
his
heart
as
he
scampered
along
the
deck
the
girl
had
wonderful
dark
auburn
hair
and
brown
eyes
with
a
skin
that
sun
and
wind
had
sought
in
vain
to
blemish
and
for
all
her
girlhood
she
was
a
woman
bred
from
a
race
his
own
people
to
whom
danger
and
despair
merely
furnished
a
tonic
for
their
courage
what
a
mate
for
a
man
and
she
had
looked
at
him
pridefully
they
were
married
before
the
ship
was
loaded
and
on
a
knoll
of
the
lands
back
of
the
town
and
commanding
a
view
of
the
bay
with
the
hills
in
back
and
the
little
redwoods
flourishing
in
the
front
yard
he
built
her
the
finest
home
in
sequoia
he
had
reserved
this
in
a
vague
hope
that
some
day
he
might
utilize
it
for
this
very
purpose
and
here
he
spent
with
her
three
wonderfully
happy
years
here
his
son
bryce
was
born
and
here
two
days
later
the
mother
made
the
supreme
sacrifice
of
maternity
for
half
a
day
following
the
destruction
of
his
eden
john
cardigan
sat
dumbly
beside
his
wife
his
great
hard
hand
caressing
the
auburn
head
whose
every
thought
for
three
years
had
been
his
happiness
and
comfort
then
the
doctor
came
to
him
and
mentioned
the
matter
of
funeral
arrangements
cardigan
looked
up
at
him
blankly
funeral
arrangements
he
murmured
funeral
arrangements
he
passed
his
gnarled
hand
over
his
leonine
head
ah
yes
i
suppose
so
i
shall
attend
to
he
rose
and
left
the
house
walking
with
bowed
head
out
of
sequoia
up
the
abandoned
and
decaying
through
the
redwoods
to
the
dark
green
blur
that
marked
the
old
timber
it
was
may
and
nature
was
renewing
herself
for
spring

late
in
humboldt
county
from
an
alder

a
pompous

in

busy
about
their
household

from
a
clump
of
manzanita
a
buck
watched
john
cardigan
curiously
on
past
the
landing
where
the
big
bull
stood
for
with
the
march
of
progress
the
logging
had
replaced
the
while
the
logs
were
hauled
out
of
the
woods
to
the
landing
by
means
of
a
steel
cable
and
there
loaded
on
the
of
a
logging
railroad
to
be
hauled
to
the
mill
and
dumped
in
the
he
went
up
the
recently
swamped
from
the
landing
to
the
down
timber
where
the
crosscut
men
and
barkpeelers
were
at
work
on
into
the
green
timber
where
the
and
his
men
were
chopping
come
with
me
mctavish
he
said
to
his
they
passed
through
a
narrow
gap
between
two
low
hills
and
emerged
in
a
long
narrow
valley
where
the
redwood
grew
thickly
and
where
the
smallest
tree
was
not
less
than
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
tall
mctavish
followed
at
the
master
heels
as
they
penetrated
this
grove
making
their
way
with
difficulty
through
the
underbrush
until
they
came
at
length
to
a
little
amphitheatre
a
clearing
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
and
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
redwoods
of
such
dimensions
that
even
mctavish
who
was
no
stranger
to
these
natural
marvels
was
struck
with
wonder
the
ground
in
this
little
amphitheatre
was
covered
to
a
depth
of
a
foot
with
brown
withered
little
redwood
twigs
to
which
the
dead
leaves
still
clung
while
up
through
this
aromatic
covering
delicate
maidenhair
ferns
and
oxalis
had
thrust
themselves
between
the
huge
brown
boles
of
the
redwoods
woodwardia
grew
riotously
while
through
the
great
branches
of
these
sentinels
of
the
ages
the
sunlight
filtered
against
the
prevailing
twilight
of
the
surrounding
forest
it
descended
like
a
halo
and
where
it
struck
the
ground
john
cardigan
paused
mctavish
he
said
she
died
this
i
sore
distressed
for
you
sir
the
answered
we
a
whisper
in
the
camp
yesterday
that
the
lass
was
like
to
be
in
a
bad
cardigan
scuffed
with
his
foot
a
clear
space
in
the
brown
litter
take
two
men
from
the
mctavish
he
ordered
and
have
them
dig
her
grave
here
then
swamp
a
trail
through
the
underbrush
and
out
to
the
so
we
can
carry
her
in
the
funeral
will
be
mctavish
nodded
any
further
orders
sir
yes
when
you
come
to
that
little
gap
in
the
hills
cease
your
logging
and
bear
off
he
waved
his
hand
i
not
going
to
cut
the
timber
in
this
valley
you
see
mctavish
what
it
is
the
trees
here
ah
man
i
have
the
heart
to
destroy
god
most
wonderful
handiwork
besides
she
loved
this
spot
mctavish
and
she
called
the
valley
her
valley
of
the
giants
i
i
gave
it
to
her
for
a
wedding
present
because
she
had
a
bit
of
a
dream
that
some
day
the
town
i
started
would
grow
up
to
yonder
gap
and
when
that
time
came
and
we
could
afford
it
was
in
her
mind
to
give
her
valley
of
the
giants
to
sequoia
for
a
city
park
all
hidden
away
here
and
unsuspected
she
loved
it
mctavish
it
pleased
her
to
come
here
with
me
she
make
up
a
lunch
of
her
own
cooking
and
i
would
catch
trout
in
the
stream
by
the
dogwoods
yonder
and
fry
the
fish
for
her
sometimes
i
barbecue
a
venison
steak
and
well
was
our
playhouse
mctavish
and
i
who
am
no
longer
young
i
who
never
played
until
i
met
her
i
i
a
bit
foolish
i
fear
but
i
found
rest
and
comfort
here
mctavish
even
before
i
met
her
and
i
thinking
i
have
to
come
here
often
for
the
same
she
she
was
a
very
superior
woman
mctavish
very
superior
ah
man
the
soul
of
her
i
can
not
bear
that
her
body
should
rest
in
sequoia
cemetery
along
with
the
rag
tag
and
bobtail
o
the
town
she
was
like
this
sunbeam
mctavish
she
she
aye
murmured
mctavish
huskily
i
ken
ye
wouldna
gie
her
a
common
or
a
public
spot
in
which
to
wait
for
ye
an
ye
be
shuttin
down
the
mill
an
an
layin
off
the
hands
in
her
honour
for
a
bit
until
after
the
funeral
mctavish
and
tell
your
men
they
be
paid
for
the
lost
time
that
will
be
all
when
mctavish
was
gone
john
cardigan
sat
down
on
a
small
windfall
his
head
held
slightly
to
one
side
while
he
listened
to
that
which
in
the
redwoods
is
not
sound
but
rather
the
absence
of
it
and
as
he
listened
he
absorbed
a
subtle
comfort
from
those
huge
brown
trees
so
emblematic
of
immortality
in
the
thought
he
grew
closer
to
his
maker
and
presently
found
that
peace
which
he
sought
love
such
as
theirs
could
never
die
the
tears
came
at
last
at
sundown
he
walked
home
bearing
an
armful
of
rhododendrons
and
dogwood
blossoms
which
he
arranged
in
the
room
where
she
lay
then
he
sought
the
nurse
who
had
attended
her
i
like
to
hold
my
son
he
said
gently
may
i
she
brought
him
the
baby
and
placed
it
in
his
great
arms
that
trembled
so
he
sat
down
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
this
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
blood
of
his
blood
you
have
her
hair
and
skin
and
eyes
he
murmured
my
son
my
son
i
shall
love
you
so
for
now
i
must
love
for
two
sorrow
i
shall
keep
from
you
please
god
and
happiness
and
worldly
comfort
shall
i
leave
you
when
i
go
to
he
nuzzled
his
grizzled
cheek
against
the
baby
face
just
you
and
my
trees
he
whispered
just
you
and
my
trees
to
help
me
hang
on
to
a
plucky
for
love
and
paternity
had
come
to
him
late
in
life
and
so
had
his
first
great
sorrow
wherefore
since
he
was
not
accustomed
to
these
heritages
of
all
flesh
he
would
have
to
adjust
himself
to
the
change
but
his
son
and
his
trees
ah
yes
they
would
help
and
he
would
gather

chapter
iii
a
young
digger
woman
who
had
suffered
the
loss
of
the
latest
of
her
numerous
progeny
two
days
prior
to
cardigan
death
was
installed
in
the
house
on
the
knoll
as
nurse
to
john
cardigan
son
whom
he
called
bryce
the
family
name
of
his
mother
people
a
tully
widow
of
cardigan
first
engineer
in
the
mill
was
engaged
as
housekeeper
and
cook
and
with
his
domestic
establishment
reorganized
along
these
simple
lines
john
cardigan
turned
with
added
eagerness
to
his
business
affairs
hoping
between
them
and
his
boy
to
salvage
as
much
as
possible
from
what
seemed
to
him
in
the
first
pangs
of
his
loneliness
and
desolation
the
wreckage
of
his
life
while
bryce
was
in
swaddling
clothes
he
was
known
only
to
those
females
of
sequoia
to
whom
his
foster
mother
proudly
exhibited
him
when
taking
him
abroad
for
an
airing
in
his
perambulator
with
his
advent
into
rompers
however
and
the
assumption
of
his
american
prerogative
of
free
speech
his
father
developed
the
habit
of
bringing
the
child
down
to
the
mill
office
to
which
he
added
a
playroom
that
connected
with
his
private
office
hence
prior
to
his
second
birthday
bryce
divined
that
his
father
was
closer
to
him
than
motherly
tully
or
the
girl
albeit
the
housekeeper
sang
to
him
the
lullabys
that
mothers
know
while
the
digger
girl
improvising
blank
verse
paeans
of
praise
and
prophecy
crooned
them
to
her
charge
in
the
unmusical
monotone
of
her
tribal
tongue
his
father
on
the
contrary
wasted
no
time
in
singing
but
would
toss
him
to
the
ceiling
or
set
him
astride
his
foot
and
swing
him
until
he
screamed
in
ecstasy
moreover
his
father
took
him
on
wonderful
journeys
which
no
other
member
of
the
household
had
even
suggested
together
they
were
wont
to
ride
to
and
from
the
woods
in
the
cab
of
the
logging
locomotive
and
once
they
both
got
on
the
log
carriage
in
the
mill
with
dan
keyes
the
head
sawyer
and
had
a
jolly
ride
up
to
the
saw
and
back
again
up
and
back
again
until
the
log
had
been
completely
sawed
and
because
he
had
refrained
from
crying
aloud
when
the
greedy
saw
bit
into
the
log
with
a
shrill
whine
dan
keyes
had
given
him
a
nickel
to
put
in
his
tin
bank
of
all
their
adventures
together
however
those
which
occurred
on
their
frequent
excursions
up
to
the
valley
of
the
giants
impressed
themselves
imperishably
upon
bryce
memory
how
well
he
remembered
their
first
trip
when
seated
astride
his
father
shoulders
with
his
sturdy
little
legs
around
cardigan
neck
and
his
chubby
little
hands
clasping
the
old
man
ears
they
had
gone
up
the
abandoned
and
into
the
of
the
forest
terminating
suddenly
in
a
shower
of
sunshine
that
fell
in
an
open
space
where
a
boy
could
roll
and
play
and
never
get
dirty
also
there
were
several
dozen
gray
squirrels
there
waiting
to
climb
on
his
shoulder
and
search
his
pockets
for
a
supply
of
which
his
father
always
furnished
bryce
always
looked
forward
with
eagerness
to
those
frequent
trips
with
his
father
to
the
place
where
mother
dear
went
to
from
his
perch
on
his
father
shoulders
he
could
look
vast
distances
into
the
underbrush
and
catch
glimpses
of
the
wild
life
therein
when
the
last
nut
had
been
distributed
to
the
squirrels
in
the
clearing
he
would
follow
a
flash
of
blue
that
was
a
jay
high
up
among
the
evergreen
branches
or
a
flash
of
red
that
was
a
woodpecker
hammering
a
home
in
the
bark
of
a
eventually
however
the
spell
of
the
forest
would
creep
over
the
child
intuitively
he
would
become
one
with
the
silence
climb
into
his
father
arms
as
the
latter
sat
dreaming
on
the
old
windfall
and
presently
drop
off
to
sleep
when
bryce
was
six
years
old
his
father
sent
him
to
the
public
school
in
sequoia
with
the
children
of
his
loggers
and
thus
laying
the
foundation
for
a
democratic
education
all
too
infrequent
with
the
sons
of
men
rated
as
millionaires
at
night
old
cardigan
for
so
men
had
now
commenced
to
designate
him
would
hear
his
boy
lessons
taking
the
while
an
immeasurable
delight
in
watching
the
lad
mind
develop
as
a
pupil
bryce
was
not
meteoric
he
had
his
father
patient
unexcitable
nature
and
like
the
old
man
he
possessed
the
glorious
gift
of
imagination
never
mediocre
he
was
never
especially
brilliant
but
was
seemingly
content
to
maintain
a
steady
dependable
average
in
all
things
he
had
his
mother
dark
auburn
hair
brown
eyes
and
fair
white
skin
and
quite
early
in
life
he
gave
promise
of
being
as
large
and
powerful
a
man
as
his
father
bryce
boyhood
was
much
the
same
as
that
of
other
lads
in
sequoia
save
that
in
the
matter
of
toys
and
later
guns
dogs
and
ponies
he
was
a
source
of
envy
to
his
fellows
after
his
tenth
year
his
father
placed
him
on
the
mill
and
on
payday
he
was
wont
to
line
up
with
the
to
receive
his
modest
stipend
of
ten
dollars
for
carrying
in
kindling
to
the
cook
in
the
mill
kitchen
each
day
after
school
this
otherwise
needless
arrangement
was
old
cardigan
way
of
teaching
his
boy
financial
responsibility
all
that
he
possessed
he
had
worked
for
and
he
wanted
his
son
to
grow
up
with
the
business
to
realize
that
he
was
a
part
of
it
with
definite
duties
connected
with
it
developing
upon
him
duties
which
he
must
never
shirk
if
he
was
to
retain
the
rich
redwood
heritage
his
father
had
been
so
eagerly
storing
up
for
him
when
bryce
cardigan
was
about
fourteen
years
old
there
occurred
an
important
event
in
his
life
in
a
commendable
effort
to
increase
his
income
he
had
laid
out
a
small
vegetable
garden
in
the
rear
of
his
father
house
and
here
on
a
saturday
morning
while
down
on
his
knees
weeding
carrots
he
chanced
to
look
up
and
discovered
a
young
lady
gazing
at
him
through
the
picket
fence
she
was
a
few
years
his
junior
and
a
stranger
in
sequoia
ensued
the
following
conversation
hello
little
hello
yourself
i
ai
a
little
she
ignored
the
correction
what
are
you
doing
weedin
carrots
ca
you
see
what
for
bryce
highly
incensed
at
having
been
designated
a
little
boy
by
this
superior
damsel
saw
his
opportunity
to
silence
her
cat
fur
for
kitten
breeches
he
retorted
without
any
evidence
of
originality
we
must
confess
whereat
she
stung
him
to
the
heart
with
a
sweet
smile
and
promptly
sang
for
him
this
ancient
ballad
of
childhood
what
are
little
boys
made
of
what
are
little
boys
made
of
snakes
and
snails
and
puppy
dog
tails
and
that
what
little
boys
are
made
bryce
knew
the
second
verse
and
shrivelled
inwardly
in
anticipation
of
being
informed
that
little
girls
are
made
of
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
nice
realizing
that
he
had
begun
something
which
might
not
terminate
with
credit
to
himself
he
hung
his
head
and
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
gave
all
his
attention
to
his
crop
and
presently
the
visitor
spoke
again
i
like
your
hair
little
boy
it
a
pretty
that
settled
the
issue
between
them
to
be
hailed
as
little
boy
was
bad
enough
but
to
be
reminded
of
his
crowning
misfortune
was
adding
insult
to
injury
he
rose
and
cautiously
approached
the
fence
with
the
intention
of
pinching
the
impudent
stranger
suddenly
and
surreptitiously
and
sending
her
away
weeping
as
his
hand
crept
between
the
palings
on
its
wicked
mission
the
little
miss
looked
at
him
in
friendly
fashion
and
queried
what
your
name
bryce
hand
hesitated
bryce
cardigan
he
answered
gruffly
i
shirley
sumner
she
ventured
let
be
when
did
you
come
to
live
in
sequoia
he
demanded
i
do
live
here
i
just
visiting
here
with
my
aunt
and
uncle
staying
at
the
hotel
and
there
nobody
to
play
with
my
uncle
name
is
pennington
so
my
aunt
he
out
here
buying
timber
and
we
live
in
michigan
do
you
know
the
capital
of
michigan
of
course
i
do
he
answered
the
capital
of
michigan
is
oh
you
big
stupid
it
is
it
neither
it
i
live
there
so
i
guess
i
ought
to
know
so
there
bryce
was
vanquished
and
an
acute
sense
of
his
imperfections
in
matters
geographical
inclined
him
to
end
the
argument
well
maybe
right
he
admitted
grudgingly
anyhow
what
difference
does
it
make
she
did
not
answer
evidently
she
was
desirous
of
avoiding
an
argument
if
possible
her
gaze
wandered
past
bryce
to
where
his
indian
pony
stood
with
her
head
out
the
window
of
her
contemplating
her
master
oh
what
a
dear
little
horse
shirley
sumner
exclaimed
whose
is
he
a
he
it
a
she
and
she
belongs
to
do
you
ride
her
not
very
often
now
i
getting
too
heavy
for
her
so
dad
bought
me
a
horse
that
weighs
nine
hundred
pounds
midget
only
weighs
five
he
considered
her
a
moment
while
she
gazed
in
awe
upon
this
man
with
two
horses
can
you
ride
a
pony
he
asked
for
no
reason
that
he
was
aware
of
she
sighed
shaking
her
head
resignedly
we
have
any
room
to
keep
a
pony
at
our
house
in
detroit
she
explained
and
added
hopefully
but
i
love
to
ride
on
midget
i
suppose
i
could
learn
to
ride
if
somebody
taught
me
he
looked
at
her
again
at
that
period
of
his
existence
he
was
inclined
to
regard
girls
as
a
necessary
evil
for
some
immutable
reason
they
existed
and
perforce
must
be
borne
with
and
it
was
his
hope
that
he
would
get
through
life
and
see
as
little
as
possible
of
the
exasperating
sex
nevertheless
as
bryce
surveyed
this
winsome
miss
through
the
palings
he
was
sensible
of
a
sneaking
desire
to
find
favour
in
her
eyes
also
equally
sensible
of
the
fact
that
the
path
to
that
desirable
end
lay
between
himself
and
midget
he
swelled
with
the
importance
of
one
who
knows
he
controls
a
delicate
situation
well
i
suppose
if
you
want
a
ride
i
have
to
give
it
to
you
he
grumbled
although
mighty
busy
this
oh
i
think
you
so
nice
she
declared
a
thrill
shot
through
him
that
was
akin
to
pain
with
difficulty
did
he
restrain
an
impulse
to
dash
wildly
into
the
stable
and
saddle
midget
in
furious
haste
instead
he
walked
to
the
barn
slowly
and
with
extreme
dignity
when
he
reappeared
he
was
leading
midget
a
little
silverpoint
runt
of
a
klamath
indian
pony
and
moses
a
sturdy
pinto
cayuse
from
the
cattle
ranges
over
in
trinity
county
i
have
to
ride
with
you
he
announced
ca
let
a
tenderfoot
like
you
go
out
alone
on
all
aflutter
with
delightful
anticipation
the
young
lady
climbed
up
on
the
gate
and
scrambled
into
the
saddle
when
bryce
swung
the
pony
broadside
to
the
gate
then
he
adjusted
the
stirrups
to
fit
her
passed
a
hair
rope
from
midget
little
hackamore
to
the
pommel
of
saddle
mounted
the
pinto
and
proceeded
with
his
first
adventure
as
a
two
hours
of
his
valuable
time
did
he
give
that
morning
before
the
call
of
duty
brought
him
back
to
the
house
and
his
neglected
crop
of
carrots
when
he
suggested
tactfully
however
that
it
was
now
necessary
that
his
guest
and
midget
separate
a
difficulty
arose
shirley
sumner
refused
point
blank
to
leave
the
premises
she
liked
bryce
for
his
hair
and
because
he
had
been
so
kind
to
her
she
was
a
stranger
in
sequoia
and
now
that
she
had
found
an
agreeable
companion
it
was
far
from
her
intention
to
desert
him
so
miss
sumner
stayed
and
helped
bryce
weed
his
carrots
and
since
as
a
voluntary
labourer
she
was
at
least
worth
her
board
at
noon
bryce
brought
her
in
to
tully
with
a
request
for
luncheon
when
he
went
to
the
mill
to
carry
in
the
kindling
for
the
cook
the
young
lady
returned
rather
sorrowfully
to
the
hotel
sequoia
with
a
fervent
promise
to
see
him
the
next
day
she
did
and
bryce
took
her
for
a
long
ride
up
into
the
valley
of
the
giants
and
showed
her
his
mother
grave
the
gray
squirrels
were
there
and
bryce
gave
shirley
a
bag
of
to
feed
them
then
they
put
some
flowers
on
the
grave
and
when
they
returned
to
town
and
bryce
was
unsaddling
the
ponies
shirley
drew
midget
nose
down
to
her
and
kissed
it
then
she
commenced
to
weep
rather
violently
what
are
you
crying
about
bryce
demanded
girls
were
so
hard
to
understand
i
she
howled
he
was
stricken
with
dismay
and
bade
her
desist
from
her
vain
repinings
but
her
heart
was
broken
and
somehow
bryce
appeared
to
act
automatically
he
had
his
arm
around
her
do
cry
shirley
he
pleaded
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
you
cry
do
you
want
midget
give
her
to
between
sobs
shirley
confessed
that
the
prospect
of
parting
with
him
and
not
midget
was
provocative
of
her
woe
this
staggered
bryce
and
pleased
him
immensely
and
at
parting
she
kissed
him
reiterating
her
opinion
that
he
was
the
nicest
kindest
boy
she
had
ever
met
or
hoped
to
meet
when
shirley
and
her
uncle
and
aunt
boarded
the
steamer
for
san
francisco
bryce
stood
disconsolate
on
the
dock
and
waved
to
shirley
until
he
could
no
longer
discern
her
on
the
deck
then
he
went
home
crawled
up
into
the
haymow
and
wept
for
he
had
something
in
his
heart
and
it
hurt
he
thought
of
his
elfin
companion
very
frequently
for
a
week
and
he
lost
his
appetite
very
much
to
tully
concern
then
the
steelhead
trout
began
to
run
in
eel
river
and
the
sweetest
event
that
can
occur
in
any
boy
existence
the
sudden
awakening
to
the
wonder
and
beauty
of
life
so
poignantly
realized
in
his
first
was
lost
sight
of
by
bryce
in
a
month
he
had
forgotten
the
incident
in
six
months
he
had
forgotten
shirley
sumner
chapter
iv
the
succeeding
years
of
bryce
cardigan
life
until
he
completed
his
studies
and
went
east
to
princeton
were
those
of
the
ordinary
youth
in
a
small
and
somewhat
primitive
country
town
he
made
frequent
trips
to
san
francisco
with
his
father
taking
passage
on
the
steamer
that
made
trips
between
sequoia
and
the
metropolis
as
the
sequoia
sentinel
always
referred
to
san
francisco
he
was
an
expert
fisherman
and
the
best
shot
with
rifle
or
in
the
county
he
delighted
in
sports
and
greatly
to
the
secret
delight
of
his
father
showed
a
profound
interest
in
the
latter
business
throughout
the
happy
years
of
bryce
boyhood
his
father
continued
to
enlarge
and
improve
his
sawmill
to
build
more
schooners
and
to
acquire
more
redwood
timber
lands
the
purchase
of
which
by
cardigan
a
decade
before
had
caused
his
neighbours
to
impugn
his
judgment
now
developed
strategical
importance
as
a
result
those
lands
necessary
to
consolidate
his
own
holdings
came
to
him
at
his
own
price
while
his
adverse
holdings
that
blocked
the
logging
operations
of
his
competitors
went
from
him
also
at
his
own
price
in
fact
all
plans
matured
satisfactorily
with
the
exception
of
one
and
since
it
has
a
very
definite
bearing
on
the
story
the
necessity
for
explaining
it
is
paramount
contiguous
to
cardigan
logging
operations
to
the
east
and
north
of
sequoia
and
comparatively
close
in
lay
a
block
of
two
thousand
acres
of
splendid
timber
the
natural
feasible
and
inexpensive
outlet
for
which
when
it
should
be
logged
was
the
valley
of
the
giants
for
thirty
years
john
cardigan
had
played
a
waiting
game
with
the
owner
of
that
timber
for
the
latter
was
as
fully
obsessed
with
the
belief
that
he
was
going
to
sell
it
to
john
cardigan
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
per
thousand
feet
stumpage
as
cardigan
was
certain
he
was
going
to
buy
it
for
a
dollar
a
thousand
when
he
should
be
ready
to
do
so
and
not
one
second
sooner
he
calculated
as
did
the
owner
of
the
timber
that
the
time
to
do
business
would
be
a
year
or
two
before
the
last
of
timber
in
that
section
should
be
gone
eventually
the
time
for
acquiring
more
timber
arrived
john
cardigan
meeting
his
neighbour
on
the
street
accosted
him
thus
look
here
bill
is
it
time
we
got
together
on
that
timber
of
yours
you
know
you
been
holding
it
to
block
me
and
force
me
to
buy
at
your
that
why
i
bought
it
the
other
admitted
smilingly
then
before
i
realized
my
position
you
checkmated
me
with
that
in
the
valley
and
we
been
deadlocked
ever
i
give
you
a
dollar
a
thousand
stumpage
for
your
timber
i
want
a
dollar
and
a
a
dollar
is
my
absolute
then
i
keep
my
and
i
keep
my
money
when
i
finish
logging
in
my
present
holdings
i
going
to
pull
out
of
that
country
and
log
twenty
miles
south
of
sequoia
i
have
ten
thousand
acres
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
remember
bill
the
man
who
buys
your
timber
will
have
to
log
it
through
my
land
and
i
not
going
to
log
that
in
the
valley
hence
there
will
be
no
outlet
for
your
timber
in
not
going
to
log
it
why
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
i
just
going
to
let
it
stay
there
until
i
die
when
my
will
is
filed
for
probate
your
curiosity
will
be
satisfied
but
not
until
the
other
laughed
john
he
declared
you
just
have
got
the
courage
to
pull
out
when
your
timber
adjoining
mine
is
gone
and
move
twenty
miles
south
to
the
san
hedrin
watershed
that
will
be
too
expensive
a
move
and
you
only
be
biting
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
face
come
through
with
a
dollar
and
a
half
i
never
bluff
bill
remember
if
i
pull
out
for
the
san
hedrin
not
abandon
my
there
to
come
back
and
log
your
timber
one
expensive
move
is
enough
for
me
better
take
a
dollar
bill
it
a
good
fair
price
as
the
market
on
redwood
timber
is
now
and
you
be
making
an
even
hundred
per
cent
on
your
investment
remember
bill
if
i
do
buy
your
timber
you
never
log
it
yourself
and
neither
will
anybody
else
you
be
stuck
with
it
for
the
next
forty
years
and
taxes
are
getting
any
lower
besides
there
a
good
deal
of
pine
and
fir
in
there
and
you
know
what
a
forest
fire
will
do
to
i
hang
on
a
little
longer
i
i
think
so
too
john
cardigan
replied
and
that
night
as
was
his
wont
even
though
he
realized
that
it
was
not
possible
for
bryce
to
gain
a
profound
understanding
of
the
business
problems
to
which
he
was
heir
john
cardigan
discussed
the
squaw
creek
timber
with
his
son
relating
to
him
the
details
of
his
conversation
with
the
owner
i
suppose
he
thinks
you
bluffing
bryce
commented
i
not
bryce
i
never
bluff
that
is
i
never
permit
a
bluff
of
mine
to
be
called
and
do
you
ever
do
it
either
remember
that
boy
any
time
you
deliver
a
verdict
be
sure
you
in
such
a
position
you
have
to
reverse
yourself
i
going
to
finish
logging
in
that
district
this
fall
so
if
i
to
keep
the
mill
running
i
have
to
establish
my
camps
on
the
san
hedrin
watershed
right
bryce
pondered
but
is
it
cheaper
to
give
him
his
price
on
squaw
creek
timber
than
go
logging
in
the
san
hedrin
and
have
to
build
twenty
miles
of
logging
railroad
to
get
your
logs
to
the
mill
it
would
be
son
if
i
had
to
build
the
railroad
fortunately
i
do
not
i
just
shoot
the
logs
down
the
hillside
to
the
san
hedrin
river
and
drive
them
down
the
stream
to
a
on
but
there
is
enough
water
in
the
san
hedrin
to
float
a
redwood
log
dad
i
fished
there
and
i
quite
true
in
the
summer
and
fall
but
when
the
winter
freshets
come
on
and
the
snow
begins
to
melt
in
the
spring
up
in
the
yola
bolas
where
the
san
hedrin
has
its
source
we
have
plenty
of
water
for
driving
the
river
once
we
get
the
logs
down
to
we
raft
them
and
tow
them
up
to
the
mill
so
you
see
bryce
we
wo
be
bothered
with
the
expense
of
maintaining
a
logging
railroad
as
at
bryce
looked
at
his
father
admiringly
i
guess
dan
keyes
is
right
dad
he
said
dan
says
you
crazy
like
a
fox
now
i
know
why
been
picking
up
claims
in
the
san
hedrin
no
you
do
bryce
i
never
told
you
but
i
tell
you
now
the
real
reason
humboldt
county
has
no
rail
connection
with
the
outside
world
so
we
are
forced
to
ship
our
lumber
by
water
but
some
day
a
railroad
will
be
built
in
from
the
south
from
san
francisco
and
when
it
comes
the
only
route
for
it
to
travel
is
through
our
timber
in
the
san
hedrin
valley
i
accumulated
that
ten
thousand
acres
for
you
my
son
for
the
railroad
will
never
be
built
in
my
day
it
may
come
in
yours
but
i
have
grown
weary
waiting
for
it
and
now
that
my
hand
is
forced
i
going
to
start
logging
there
it
does
matter
son
you
will
still
be
logging
there
fifty
years
from
now
and
when
the
railroad
people
come
to
you
for
a
right
of
way
my
boy
give
it
to
them
charge
them
a
cent
it
has
always
been
my
policy
to
encourage
the
development
of
this
county
and
i
want
you
to
be
a
citizen
that
why
i
sending
you
east
to
college
you
been
born
and
raised
in
this
town
and
you
must
see
more
of
the
world
you
must
be
narrow
or
provincial
because
i
saving
up
for
you
my
son
a
great
many
responsibilities
and
i
want
to
educate
you
to
meet
them
bravely
and
he
paused
regarding
the
boy
gravely
and
tenderly
bryce
lad
he
said
presently
do
you
ever
wonder
why
i
work
so
hard
and
barely
manage
to
spare
the
time
to
go
camping
with
you
in
vacation
time
why
do
you
take
it
easy
dad
you
do
work
awfully
hard
and
i
have
wondered
about
i
have
to
work
hard
my
son
because
i
started
something
a
long
time
ago
when
work
was
fun
and
now
i
ca
let
go
i
employ
too
many
people
who
are
dependent
on
me
for
their
bread
and
butter
when
they
plan
a
marriage
or
the
building
of
a
home
or
the
purchase
of
a
cottage
organ
they
have
to
figure
me
in
on
the
proposition
i
did
have
a
name
for
the
part
i
played
in
these
people
lives
until
the
other
night
when
i
was
helping
you
with
your
algebra
i
the
unknown
oh
no
bryce
protested
you
the
known
cardigan
smiled
well
maybe
i
am
he
admitted
i
always
tried
to
be
and
if
i
have
succeeded
then
you
the
unknown
quantity
bryce
because
some
day
you
have
to
take
my
place
they
will
have
to
depend
upon
you
when
i
am
gone
listen
to
me
son
you
only
a
boy
and
you
ca
understand
everything
i
tell
you
now
but
i
want
you
to
remember
what
i
tell
you
and
some
day
understanding
will
come
to
you
you
must
fail
the
people
who
work
for
you
who
are
dependent
upon
your
strength
and
brains
and
enterprises
to
furnish
them
with
an
opportunity
for
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
when
you
are
the
boss
of
cardigan
mill
you
must
keep
the
wheels
turning
you
must
never
shut
down
the
mill
or
the
in
dull
times
just
to
avoid
a
loss
you
can
stand
better
than
your
his
hard
trembling
old
hand
closed
over
the
boy
i
want
you
to
be
a
brave
and
honourable
man
he
concluded
true
to
his
word
when
john
cardigan
finished
his
logging
in
his
old
original
holdings
adjacent
to
sequoia
and
bill
henderson
squaw
creek
timber
he
quietly
moved
south
with
his
squaw
creek
and
joined
the
crew
already
getting
out
logs
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
not
until
then
did
bill
henderson
realize
that
john
cardigan
had
called
his
bluff
whereat
he
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
and
a
poor
judge
of
human
nature
he
had
tried
a
game
and
had
failed
a
dollar
a
thousand
feet
stumpage
was
a
fair
price
for
years
he
had
needed
the
money
and
now
when
it
was
too
late
he
realized
his
error
luck
was
with
henderson
however
for
shortly
thereafter
there
came
again
to
sequoia
one
colonel
seth
pennington
a
millionaire
operator
from
michigan
the
colonel
michigan
lands
had
been
logged
off
and
since
he
had
had
one
taste
of
cheap
timber
having
seen
stumpage
go
to
five
dollars
the
colonel
like
oliver
twist
desired
some
more
of
the
same
on
his
previous
visit
to
sequoia
he
had
seen
his
chance
awaiting
him
in
the
gradually
decreasing
market
for
redwood
lumber
and
the
corresponding
increase
of
melancholia
in
the
redwood
operators
hence
he
had
returned
to
michigan
closed
out
his
business
interests
there
and
returned
to
sequoia
on
the
alert
for
an
investment
in
redwood
timber
from
a
on
the
porch
of
the
hotel
sequoia
the
colonel
had
heard
the
tale
of
how
old
john
cardigan
had
called
the
bluff
of
equally
old
bill
henderson
so
for
the
next
few
weeks
the
colonel
under
pretense
of
going
hunting
or
fishing
on
squaw
creek
managed
to
make
a
fairly
accurate
cursory
cruise
of
the
henderson
timber
following
which
he
purchased
it
from
the
delighted
bill
for
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
per
thousand
feet
stumpage
and
paid
for
it
with
a
certified
check
with
his
check
in
his
hand
henderson
queried
colonel
how
do
you
purpose
logging
that
timber
the
colonel
smiled
oh
i
do
intend
to
log
it
when
i
log
timber
it
has
to
be
more
accessible
i
just
going
to
hold
on
and
outgame
your
former
prospect
john
cardigan
he
needs
that
timber
he
has
to
have
it
and
one
of
these
days
he
pay
me
two
dollars
for
bill
henderson
raised
an
admonitory
finger
and
shook
it
under
the
colonel
nose
hear
me
stranger
he
warned
when
you
know
john
cardigan
as
well
as
i
do
you
change
your
tune
he
does
he
does
the
colonel
laughed
derisively
why
that
move
of
his
over
to
the
san
hedrin
was
the
most
monumental
bluff
ever
pulled
off
in
this
all
right
sir
you
wait
and
i
seen
already
i
how
do
you
know
well
for
one
thing
henderson
i
noticed
cardigan
has
carefully
housed
his
and
he
has
scrapped
his
five
miles
of
logging
railroad
and
three
miles
of
old
bill
henderson
chewed
his
quid
of
tobacco
reflectively
and
spat
at
a
crack
in
the
sidewalk
no
he
replied
i
admit
he
ai
started
scrappin
it
yet
but
i
happen
to
know
he
sold
the
rails
to
the
freshwater
lumber
company
so
i
reckon
they
be
that
railroad
for
him
before
the
colonel
was
visibly
moved
if
your
information
is
authentic
he
said
slowly
i
suppose
i
have
to
build
a
mill
on
tidewater
and
log
the
pay
you
to
do
that
at
the
present
price
of
redwood
i
in
no
hurry
i
can
wait
for
better
well
when
better
times
arrive
you
find
that
john
cardigan
owns
the
only
property
on
this
side
of
the
bay
where
the
water
deep
enough
to
let
a
ship
lie
at
low
tide
and
load
in
there
is
deep
water
across
the
bay
and
plenty
of
property
for
sale
i
find
a
there
and
tow
my
logs
but
you
got
to
dump
in
the
water
on
this
side
everything
north
of
cardigan
mill
is
he
owns
all
the
frontage
for
a
mile
south
of
sequoia
and
after
that
come
more
if
you
dump
your
logs
on
these
they
bog
down
in
the
mud
and
there
is
water
enough
at
high
tide
to
float
off
or
let
a
tug
go
in
an
snake
you
a
discouraging
sort
of
person
the
colonel
declared
irritably
i
suppose
you
tell
me
now
that
i
ca
log
my
timber
without
permission
from
old
bill
spat
at
another
crack
his
faded
blue
eyes
twinkled
mischievously
no
that
where
you
got
the
bulge
on
john
colonel
you
can
build
a
logging
railroad
from
the
southern
fringe
of
your
timber
north
and
up
a
ten
per
cent
grade
on
the
far
side
of
the
squaw
creek
watershed
then
west
three
miles
around
a
spur
of
low
hills
and
then
south
eleven
miles
through
the
level
country
along
the
bay
shore
if
you
want
to
reduce
your
squaw
creek
grade
to
say
two
per
figure
on
ten
additional
miles
of
railroad
and
a
couple
extra
locomotives
you
understand
of
course
colonel
that
no
locomotive
can
haul
a
long
trainload
of
redwood
logs
up
a
long
crooked
two
per
cent
grade
you
have
to
have
an
extry
in
back
to
nonsense
i
build
my
road
from
squaw
creek
gulch
south
through
that
valley
where
those
whopping
big
trees
grow
that

natural
outlet
for
the
timber

graphic
colonel
pennington
took
from
his
pocket
the
rough
of
the
region
which
we
have
reproduced
herewith
and
pointed
to
the
spot
numbered
but
that
valley
ai
logged
yet
explained
henderson
do
worry
cardigan
will
sell
that
valley
to
me
also
a
right
of

down
his

through
his

bet
you

up
there
why
colonel
that
the
biggest
grove
of
the
biggest
sequoia
sempervirens
in
the
world
an
many
the
time
i
heard
john
say
he
almost
as
lief
cut
off
his
right
hand
as
fell
one
o
his
giants
as
he
calls
i
tell
you
colonel
john

mighty
peculiar
about
them
big
trees
any
time
he
can
get
a
day
off
he
goes
up
an
looks
but
my
very
dear
sir
the
colonel
protested
if
the
man
will
not
listen
to
reason
the
courts
will
make
him
i
can
condemn
a
right
of
way
you
said
old
bill
wagging
his
head
sagely
mebbe
you
can
then
again
mebbe
you
ca
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
figger
out
just
where
i
stood
but
mebbe
you
quicker
at
figgers
than
i
am
anyhow
colonel
good
luck
to
you
whichever
way
the
cat
this
illuminating
conversation
had
one
effect
on
colonel
seth
pennington
it
decided
him
to
make
haste
slowly
so
without
taking
the
trouble
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
john
cardigan
he
returned
to
detroit
there
to
await
the
next
move
in
this
gigantic
game
of
chess
chapter
v
no
man
is
infallible
and
in
planning
his
logging
operations
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
john
cardigan
presently
made
the
discovery
that
he
had
erred
in
judgment
that
season
from
may
to
november
his
put
thirty
million
feet
of
logs
into
the
san
hedrin
river
while
the
mill
sawed
on
a
reserve
supply
of
logs
taken
from
the
last
of
the
old
choppings
adjacent
to
squaw
creek
that
year
however
the
rainfall
in
the
san
hedrin
country
was
fifty
per
cent
less
than
normal
and
by
the
first
of
may
of
the
following
year
cardigan
had
succeeded
in
driving
slightly
less
than
half
of
the
cut
of
the
preceding
year
to
the
boom
on
tidewater
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
unless
the
lord
gi
us
a
lot
more
water
in
the
river
the
mctavish
complained
i
dinna
see
how
i
to
keep
the
mill
he
was
taking
john
cardigan
up
the
riverbank
and
explaining
the
situation
the
heavy
hae
sunk
to
the
bottom
he
continued
wie
a
normal
head
o
water
the
lads
move
them
but
wi
the
wee
drappie
we
have
the
noo
he
threw
up
his
hamlike
hands
despairingly
three
days
later
a
filled
the
river
to
the
brim
it
came
at
night
and
swept
the
river
clean
of
cardigan
clear
logs
an
army
of
juggernauts
they
swept
down
on
the
boiling
torrent
to
tidewater
reaching
the
bay
shortly
after
the
tide
had
commenced
to
ebb
now
a
chain
is
only
as
strong
as
its
weakest
link
and
a
is
a
chaplet
of
a
small
logs
linked
end
to
end
by
means
of
short
chains
hence
when
the
vanguard
of
logs
on
the
lip
of
that
flood
reached
the
the
impetus
of
the
charge
was
too
great
to
be
resisted
straight
through
the
weakest
link
in
this
boom
the
huge
crashed
and
out
over
humboldt
bar
to
the
broad
pacific
with
the
ebb
tide
some
of
them
came
back
while
others
caught
in
bobbed
about
the
bay
all
night
and
finally
beached
at
widely
scattered
points
out
of
the
fifteen
million
feet
of
logs
less
than
three
million
feet
were
salvaged
and
this
task
in
itself
was
an
expensive
operation
john
cardigan
received
the
news
calmly
thank
god
we
do
have
a
more
than
once
in
ten
years
he
remarked
to
his
manager
however
that
is
often
enough
considering
the
high
cost
of
this
one
those
logs
were
worth
eight
dollars
a
thousand
feet
board
measure
in
the
millpond
and
i
suppose
we
lost
a
hundred
thousand
he
turned
from
the
manager
and
walked
away
through
the
drying
yard
up
the
main
street
of
sequoia
and
on
into
the
timber
at
the
edge
of
the
town
presently
he
emerged
on
the
old
decaying
and
continued
on
through
his
lands
across
the
little
divide
and
down
into
the
of
green
timber
he
had
told
mctavish
not
to
cut
once
in
the
valley
of
the
giants
he
followed
a
to
the
little
amphitheatre
and
where
the
sunlight
filtered
through
like
a
halo
and
fell
on
a
plain
little
white
marble
monument
he
paused
and
sat
down
on
the
now
almost
decayed
windfall
i
come
for
a
little
comfort
sweetheart
he
murmured
to
her
who
slept
beneath
the
stone
then
he
leaned
back
against
a
redwood
tree
removed
his
hat
and
closed
his
eyes
holding
his
great
gray
head
the
while
a
little
to
one
side
in
a
listening
attitude
long
he
sat
there
a
great
devotee
at
the
shrine
of
his
comfort
and
presently
the
harried
look
left
his
strong
kind
face
and
was
replaced
by
a
little
prescient
smile
the
sort
of
smile
worn
by
one
who
through
bitter
years
has
sought
something
very
very
precious
and
has
at
length
discovered
it
chapter
vi
it
was
on
the
day
that
john
cardigan
received
the
telegram
from
bryce
saying
that
following
four
years
at
princeton
and
two
years
of
travel
abroad
he
was
returning
to
sequoia
to
take
over
his
redwood
heritage
that
he
discovered
that
a
stranger
and
not
the
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
the
blood
of
his
blood
was
to
reap
the
reward
of
his
fifty
years
of
endeavour
small
wonder
then
that
he
laid
his
leonine
head
upon
his
desk
and
wept
silently
as
the
aged
and
helpless
weep
for
a
long
time
he
sat
there
lethargic
with
misery
eventually
he
roused
himself
reached
for
the
desk
telephone
and
pressed
a
button
on
the
office
his
manager
one
thomas
sinclair
answered
thomas
he
said
calmly
you
know
of
course
that
bryce
is
coming
home
tell
george
to
take
the
big
car
and
go
over
to
red
bluff
for
i
attend
to
it
mr
cardigan
anything
else
yes
but
i
wait
until
bryce
gets
george
sea
otter
son
of
bryce
cardigan
old
nurse
was
a
person
in
whose
nature
struggled
the
white
man
predilection
for
advertisement
and
civic
pride
and
the
red
man
instinct
for
adornment
for
three
years
he
had
been
old
man
cardigan
chauffeur
and
about
the
latter
home
and
in
the
former
capacity
he
drove
john
cardigan
single
evidence
of
extravagance
a
napier
car
which
was
very
justly
regarded
by
george
sea
otter
as
the
king
of
automobiles
since
it
was
the
only
imported
car
in
the
county
upon
receipt
of
orders
therefore
from
sinclair
to
drive
the
napier
over
to
red
bluff
and
meet
his
future
boss
and
playfellow
george
sea
otter
arrayed
himself
in
a
pair
of
new
black
corduroy
trousers
yellow
button
shoes
a
blue
woollen
shirt
with
a
large
scarlet
silk
handkerchief
tied
around
the
neck
a
pair
of
beaded
buckskin
gloves
with
fringe
dependent
from
the
gauntlet
and
a
broad
white
beaver
hat
with
a
band
across
the
windshield
of
the
napier
he
fastened
an
pennant
bearing
in
bright
green
letters
the
legend
my
city
sequoia
as
a
precaution
against
man
and
beast
en
route
he
buckled
a
to
the
spare
tires
on
the
and
slipped
a
rifle
into
the
scabbard
within
quick
and
easy
reach
of
his
hand
and
arrayed
thus
george
descended
upon
red
bluff
at
the
helm
of
the
king
of
automobiles
when
the
overland
train
coasted
into
red
bluff
and
slid
to
a
grinding
halt
bryce
cardigan
saw
that
the
highest
living
authority
had
descended
from
the
train
also
he
had
elected
to
designate
her
thus
in
the
absence
of
any
information
anent
her
christian
and
family
names
and
for
the
further
reason
that
quite
obviously
she
was
a
very
superior
person
he
had
a
vague
suspicion
that
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
in
whose
presence
a
man
always
feels
that
he
must
appear
on
parade
one
of
those
alert
highly
intelligent
young
women
so
extremely
apt
to
reduce
an
ordinarily
intelligent
young
man
to
a
state
of
gibbering
idiocy
or
stupid
immobility
bryce
had
travelled
in
the
same
car
with
the
highest
living
authority
from
chicago
and
had
made
up
his
mind
by
observation
that
with
a
little
encouragement
she
could
be
induced
to
mount
a
and
make
a
speech
about
women
rights
that
when
her
native
state
should
be
granted
equal
suffrage
she
would
run
for
office
or
manage
somebody
political
campaign
that
she
could
drive
an
automobile
and
had
probably
been
arrested
for
speeding
that
she
could
go
around
any
golf
links
in
the
country
in
ninety
and
had
read
maeterlinck
and
enjoyed
it
bryce
could
see
that
she
was
the
little
daughter
of
some
large
rich
man
the
sparsity
of
jewellery
and
the
rich
simplicity
of
her
attire
proved
that
and
moreover
she
was
accompanied
by
a
french
maid
to
whom
she
spoke
french
in
a
manner
which
testified
that
before
acquiring
the
french
maid
she
had
been
in
the
custody
of
a
french
nurse
she
possessed
poise
for
the
rest
she
had
wonderful
hair
violet
eyes
and
skin
a
correct
nose
but
a
somewhat
generous
mouth
bryce
guessed
she
was
twenty
or
years
old
and
that
she
had
a
temper
susceptible
of
being
aroused
on
the
whole
she
was
rather
wonderful
but
not
dazzling
at
least
not
to
bryce
cardigan
he
told
himself
she
merely
interested
him
as
a
type
whatever
he
meant
by
that
the
fact
that
this
remarkable
young
woman
had
also
left
the
train
at
red
bluff
further
interested
him
for
he
knew
red
bluff
and
while
giving
due
credit
to
the
many
lovely
damsels
of
that
ambitious
little
city
bryce
had
a
suspicion
that
no
former
red
bluff
girl
would
dare
to
invade
the
old
home
town
with
a
french
maid
he
noted
as
further
evidence
of
the
correctness
of
his
assumption
that
the
youthful
at
the
station
failed
to
recognize
her
and
was
evidently
dazzled
when
followed
by
the
maid
struggling
with
two
she
approached
him
and
in
pure
though
alien
english
the
italian
a
predominated
inquired
the
name
and
location
of
the
best
hotel
and
the
hour
and
point
of
departure
of
the
automobile
stage
for
san
hedrin
the
youth
had
answered
her
first
question
and
was
about
to
answer
the
second
when
george
sea
otter
in
all
his
barbaric
splendour
came
around
the
corner
of
the
station
in
old
man
cardigan
regal
the
highest
living
authority
following
the
gaze
of
the
turned
and
beheld
george
sea
otter
beyond
a
doubt
he
was
of
the
west
westward
she
had
heard
that
california
were
picturesque
fellows
and
in
all
probability
the
displacing
of
the
old
concord
coach
of
the
in
favour
of
the
had
not
disturbed
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
drivers
in
their
choice
of
raiment
she
noted
the
projecting
from
the
scabbard
and
a
vision
of
a
stage
flashed
across
her
mind
ah
yes
of
course
the
express
messenger
weapon
no
doubt
and
further
to
clinch
her
instant
assumption
that
here
was
the
sequoia
there
was
the
pennant
adorning
the
dismissing
the
with
a
gracious
smile
the
highest
living
authority
approached
george
sea
otter
noting
the
while
further
evidence
that
this
car
was
a
public
conveyance
for
the
young
man
who
had
been
her
was
heading
toward
the
automobile
also
she
heard
him
say
hello
george
you
radiant
red
rascal
i
mighty
glad
to
see
you
boy
shake
they
shook
george
sea
otter
dark
eyes
and
white
teeth
flashing
pleasurably
bryce
tossed
his
bag
into
the
tonneau
the
opened
the
front
door
and
the
young
master
had
his
foot
on
the
and
was
about
to
enter
the
car
when
a
soft
voice
spoke
at
his
elbow
driver
this
is
the
stage
for
sequoia
is
it
not
george
sea
otter
could
scarcely
credit
his
auditory
nerves
this
car
he
demanded
bluntly
this
the
sequoia
stage
take
a
look
lady
this
here
a
napier
imported
english
automobile
it
a
private
car
and
belongs
to
my
boss
i
so
sorry
i
slandered
your
car
she
replied
demurely
i
observed
the
pennant
on
the
and
i
thought
bryce
cardigan
turned
and
lifted
his
hat
quite
naturally
you
thought
it
was
the
sequoia
stage
he
said
to
her
he
turned
a
smoldering
glance
upon
george
sea
otter
george
he
declared
ominously
but
with
a
sly
wink
that
drew
the
sting
from
his
words
if
you
anxious
to
hold
down
your
job
the
next
time
a
lady
speaks
to
you
and
asks
you
a
simple
question
you
answer
yes
or
no
and
refrain
from
sarcastic
remarks
do
let
your
enthusiasm
for
this
car
run
away
with
he
faced
the
girl
again
was
it
your
intention
to
go
out
to
sequoia
on
the
next
trip
of
the
stage
she
nodded
that
means
you
will
have
to
wait
here
three
days
until
the
stage
returns
from
sequoia
bryce
replied
i
realized
of
course
that
we
would
arrive
here
too
late
to
connect
with
the
stage
if
it
maintained
the
customary
schedule
for
its
departure
she
explained
but
it
did
occur
to
me
that
the
would
wait
until
our
train
arrived
i
had
an
idea
his
schedule
was
rather
have
no
imagination
to
speak
of
bryce
assured
her
to
himself
he
remarked
she
used
to
having
people
wait
on
a
shade
of
annoyance
passed
over
the
classic
features
of
the
highest
living
authority
oh
dear
she
complained
how
fearfully
awkward
now
i
shall
have
to
take
the
next
train
to
san
francisco
and
book
passage
on
the
steamer
to
sequoia
and
marcelle
is
such
a
poor
sailor
oh
dear
bryce
had
an
inspiration
and
hastened
to
reveal
it
we
are
about
to
start
for
sequoia
now
although
the
lateness
of
our
start
will
compel
us
to
put
up
tonight
at
the
on
the
south
fork
of
trinity
river
and
continue
the
journey
in
the
morning
however
this
is
eminently
respectable
and
the
food
and
accommodations
are
extraordinarily
good
for
mountains
so
if
an
invitation
to
occupy
the
tonneau
of
my
car
will
not
be
construed
as
an
impertinence
coming
as
it
does
from
a
total
stranger
you
are
at
liberty
to
regard
this
car
as
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
public
conveyance
which
so
scandalously
declined
to
wait
for
you
this
she
looked
at
him
searchingly
for
a
brief
instant
then
with
a
peculiarly
winning
smile
and
a
graceful
inclination
of
her
head
she
thanked
him
and
accepted
his
hospitality
thus
why
certainly
not
you
are
very
kind
and
i
shall
be
eternally
thank
you
for
that
vote
of
confidence
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
have
your
permission
to
introduce
myself
my
name
is
bryce
cardigan
and
i
live
in
sequoia
when
i
at
of
cardigan
redwoods
she
questioned
he
nodded
i
heard
of
you
i
think
she
continued
i
am
shirley
you
do
not
live
in
no
but
i
going
to
hereafter
i
was
there
about
ten
years
he
grinned
and
thrust
out
a
great
hand
which
she
surveyed
gravely
for
a
minute
before
inserting
hers
in
it
i
wonder
he
said
if
it
is
to
be
my
duty
to
give
you
a
ride
every
time
you
come
to
sequoia
the
last
time
you
were
there
you
wheedled
me
into
giving
you
a
ride
on
my
pony
an
animal
known
as
midget
do
you
by
any
chance
recall
that
incident
she
looked
up
at
him
wonderingly
why
why
you
the
boy
with
the
beautiful
auburn
hair
she
declared
he
lifted
his
hat
and
revealed
his
thick
thatch
in
all
its
glory
i
not
so
sensitive
about
it
now
he
explained
when
we
first
met
reference
to
my
hair
was
apt
to
rile
he
shook
her
little
hand
with
cordial
what
a
pity
it
was
possible
for
us
to
renew
acquaintance
on
the
train
miss
sumner
better
late
than
never
cardigan
considering
the
predicament
in
which
you
found
me
what
became
of
midget
midget
i
regret
to
state
made
a
little
pig
of
herself
one
day
and
died
of
acute
indigestion
she
ate
half
a
sack
of
carrots
and
knowing
full
well
that
she
was
eating
forbidden
fruit
she
bolted
them
and
for
her
failure
to
fletcherize
but
speaking
of
fletcherizing
did
you
dine
aboard
the
train
she
nodded
so
did
i
miss
sumner
hence
i
take
it
that
you
are
quite
ready
to
quite
then
we
drift
george
suppose
you
pile
miss
sumner
in
the
tonneau
and
then
pile
in
there
yourself
and
keep
marcelle
company
i
drive
and
you
can
sit
up
in
front
with
me
miss
sumner
snug
behind
the
where
you
not
be
blown
i
sure
this
is
going
to
be
a
far
pleasanter
journey
than
the
stage
could
possibly
have
afforded
she
said
graciously
as
bryce
slipped
in
beside
her
and
took
the
wheel
you
are
very
kind
to
share
the
pleasure
with
me
miss
he
went
through
his
gears
and
the
car
glided
away
on
its
journey
by
the
way
he
said
suddenly
as
he
turned
west
toward
the
distant
blue
mountains
of
trinity
county
how
did
you
happen
to
connect
me
with
redwoods
i
heard
my
uncle
colonel
seth
pennington
speak
of
colonel
seth
pennington
means
nothing
in
my
young
life
i
never
heard
of
him
before
so
i
dare
say
he
a
newcomer
in
our
country
i
been
away
six
years
he
added
in
explanation
we
from
michigan
uncle
was
formerly
in
the
lumber
business
there
but
he
logged
out
i
see
so
he
came
west
i
suppose
and
bought
a
lot
of
redwood
timber
cheap
from
some
old
croaker
who
never
could
see
any
future
to
the
redwood
lumber
industry
personally
i
do
think
he
could
have
made
a
better
investment
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
making
his
acquaintance
when
i
deliver
you
to
him
perhaps
you
may
be
a
neighbour
of
mine
hope
at
this
juncture
george
sea
otter
who
had
been
an
interested
listener
to
the
conversation
essayed
a
grunt
from
the
rear
seat
instantly
to
shirley
sumner
vast
surprise
her
host
grunted
also
whereupon
george
sea
otter
broke
into
a
series
of
grunts
and
guttural
exclamations
which
evidently
appeared
quite
intelligible
to
her
host
for
he
slowed
down
to
five
miles
an
hour
and
cocked
one
ear
to
the
rear
apparently
he
was
profoundly
interested
in
whatever
information
his
henchman
had
to
impart
when
george
sea
otter
finished
his
harangue
bryce
nodded
and
once
more
gave
his
attention
to
tossing
the
miles
behind
him
what
language
was
that
shirley
sumner
inquired
consumed
with
curiosity
digger
indian
he
replied
george
mother
was
my
nurse
and
he
and
i
grew
up
together
so
i
ca
very
well
help
speaking
the
language
of
the
they
chattered
volubly
on
many
subjects
for
the
first
twenty
miles
then
the
road
narrowed
and
commenced
to
climb
steadily
and
thereafter
bryce
gave
all
of
his
attention
to
the
car
for
a
deviation
of
a
foot
from
the
on
the
outside
of
the
road
would
have
sent
them
hurtling
over
the
grade
into
the
canons
below
their
course
led
through
a
rugged
wilderness
widely
diversified
and
transcendently
beautiful
and
the
girl
was
rather
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
it
in
silence
also
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
bryce
gaze
never
wavered
from
the
road
immediately
in
front
of
the
car
she
had
a
chance
to
appraise
him
critically
while
pretending
to
look
past
him
to
the
tumbled
ranges
to
their
right
she
saw
a
big
supple
powerful
man
of
or
six
with
the
bearing
and
general
demeanour
of
one
many
years
his
elder
his
rich
dark
auburn
hair
was
wavy
and
a
curling
lock
of
it
had
escaped
from
the
band
of
his
cap
at
the
temple
his
eyes
were
brown
to
match
his
hair
and
were
the
striking
feature
of
a
strong
rugged
countenance
for
they
were
spaced
at
that
eminently
proper
interval
which
proclaims
an
honest
man
his
nose
was
high
of
medium
thickness
and
just
a
trifle
long
the
nose
of
a
thinker
his
ears
were
large
with
full
lobes
the
ears
of
a
generous
man
the
mouth
but
firm
the
heavy
jaw
and
square
chin
the
great
hands
most
amazingly
free
from
freckles
denoted
the
man
who
would
not
avoid
a
fight
worth
while
indeed
while
the
girl
was
looking
covertly
at
him
she
saw
his
jaw
set
and
a
sudden
fierce
light
leap
up
in
his
eyes
which
at
first
sight
had
seemed
to
her
rather
quizzical
subconsciously
he
lifted
one
hand
from
the
wheel
and
clenched
it
he
wagged
his
head
a
very
little
bit
consequently
she
knew
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
for
some
reason
not
quite
clear
to
her
she
would
have
preferred
that
they
were
as
a
usual
thing
young
men
did
not
go
in
her
presence
so
she
sought
to
divert
his
thoughts
to
present
company
what
a
perfectly
glorious
country
she
exclaimed
ca
we
stop
for
just
a
minute
to
appreciate
it
yes
he
replied
abstractedly
as
he
descended
from
the
car
and
sat
at
her
feet
while
she
drank
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
it
a
he
country
i
love
it
and
i
glad
to
get
back
to
upon
their
arrival
at
the
however
bryce
cheered
up
and
during
dinner
was
very
attentive
and
mildly
amusing
although
keen
wits
assured
her
that
this
was
merely
a
clever
pose
and
sustained
with
difficulty
she
was
confirmed
in
this
assumption
when
after
sitting
with
him
a
little
on
the
porch
after
dinner
she
complained
of
being
weary
and
bade
him
she
had
scarcely
left
him
when
he
called
george
the
slid
out
of
the
darkness
and
sat
down
beside
him
a
moment
later
through
the
open
window
of
her
room
just
above
the
porch
where
bryce
and
george
sea
otter
sat
shirley
heard
the
former
say
george
when
did
you
first
notice
that
my
father
sight
was
beginning
to
fail
about
two
years
ago
what
made
you
notice
it
he
began
to
walk
with
his
hands
held
out
in
front
of
him
and
sometimes
he
lifted
his
feet
too
can
he
see
at
all
now
george
oh
yes
a
little
bit
enough
to
make
his
way
to
the
office
and
poor
old
governor
george
until
you
told
me
this
afternoon
i
heard
a
word
about
it
if
i
had
i
never
would
have
taken
that
jaunt
around
the
george
sea
otter
grunted
that
what
your
father
said
too
so
he
would
tell
you
and
he
ordered
everybody
else
to
keep
quiet
about
it
myself
well
i
did
want
you
to
go
home
and
not
know
it
until
you
met
that
was
mighty
kind
and
considerate
of
you
george
and
you
say
this
man
colonel
pennington
and
my
father
have
been
having
trouble
yes
here
george
sea
otter
gracefully
unburdened
himself
of
a
fervent
curse
directed
at
shirley
avuncular
relative
whereupon
that
young
lady
promptly
left
the
window
and
heard
no
more
they
were
on
the
road
again
by
eight
next
morning
and
just
as
cardigan
mill
was
blowing
the
six
whistle
bryce
stopped
the
car
at
the
head
of
the
street
leading
down
to
the
i
let
you
drive
now
george
he
informed
the
silent
sea
otter
he
turned
to
shirley
sumner
i
going
to
leave
you
now
he
said
thank
you
for
riding
over
from
red
bluff
with
me
my
father
never
leaves
the
office
until
the
whistle
blows
and
so
i
going
to
hurry
down
to
that
little
building
you
see
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
surprise
he
stepped
out
on
the
stood
there
a
moment
and
extended
his
hand
shirley
had
commenced
a
due
and
formal
expression
of
her
gratitude
for
having
been
delivered
safely
in
sequoia
when
george
sea
otter
spoke
here
comes
john
cardigan
he
said
drive
miss
sumner
around
to
colonel
pennington
house
bryce
ordered
and
even
while
he
held
shirley
hand
he
turned
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
his
father
shirley
followed
his
glance
and
saw
a
tall
powerfully
built
old
man
coming
down
the
street
with
his
hands
thrust
a
little
in
front
of
him
as
if
for
protection
from
some
invisible
assailant
oh
my
poor
old
father
she
heard
bryce
cardigan
murmur
my
dear
old
pal
and
i
let
him
grope
in
the
dark
for
two
years
he
released
her
hand
and
leaped
from
the
car
dad
he
called
it
is
i
bryce
i
come
home
to
you
at
the
slightly
bent
figure
of
john
cardigan
straightened
with
a
jerk
he
held
out
his
arms
trembling
with
eagerness
and
as
the
car
continued
on
to
the
pennington
house
shirley
looked
back
and
saw
bryce
folded
in
his
father
embrace
she
did
not
however
hear
the
with
which
the
beaten
old
man
welcomed
his
boy
sonny
sonny
oh
i
so
glad
you
back
i
missed
you
bryce
whipped
i
lost
your
heritage
oh
son
i
old
i
ca
fight
any
more
i
blind
i
ca
see
my
enemies
i
lost
your
redwood
trees
even
your
mother
valley
of
the
and
he
commenced
to
weep
for
the
third
time
in
fifty
years
and
when
the
aged
and
helpless
weep
nothing
is
more
terrible
bryce
cardigan
said
no
word
but
held
his
father
close
to
his
great
heart
and
laid
his
cheek
gently
against
the
old
man
tenderly
as
a
woman
might
and
presently
from
that
silent
communion
of
spirit
each
drew
strength
and
comfort
as
the
shadows
fell
in
john
cardigan
town
they
went
home
to
the
house
on
the
hill
chapter
vii
shirley
sumner
eyes
were
still
moist
when
george
sea
otter
in
obedience
to
the
instructions
of
his
youthful
master
set
her
the
french
maid
and
their
down
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
colonel
seth
pennington
house
the
hesitated
a
moment
undecided
whether
he
would
carry
the
up
to
the
door
or
leave
that
task
for
a
pennington
retainer
then
he
noted
the
on
the
cheeks
of
his
fair
passenger
instantly
he
took
up
the
kicked
open
the
iron
gate
and
preceded
shirley
up
the
cement
walk
to
the
door
just
wait
a
moment
if
you
please
george
shirley
said
as
he
set
the
baggage
down
and
started
back
for
the
car
he
turned
and
beheld
her
extracting
a
bill
from
her
purse
for
you
george
she
continued
thank
you
so
in
all
his
life
george
sea
otter
had
never
had
such
an
experience
he
happily
having
been
raised
in
a
country
where
with
the
exception
of
waiters
only
a
pronounced
vagrant
expects
or
accepts
a
gratuity
from
a
woman
he
took
the
bill
and
fingered
it
curiously
then
his
white
blood
asserted
itself
and
he
handed
the
bill
back
to
shirley
thank
you
he
said
respectfully
if
you
are
a
man
all
right
but
from
a
lady
no
i
am
like
my
boss
i
work
for
you
for
shirley
did
not
understand
his
refusal
but
her
instinctive
tact
warned
her
not
to
insist
she
returned
the
bill
to
her
purse
thanked
him
again
and
turned
quickly
to
hide
the
slight
flush
of
annoyance
george
sea
otter
noted
it
lady
he
said
with
great
dignity
at
first
i
did
not
want
to
carry
your
baggage
i
did
not
want
to
walk
on
this
and
with
a
sweeping
gesture
he
indicated
the
pennington
grounds
then
you
cry
a
little
because
my
boss
is
feeling
bad
about
his
old
man
so
i
like
you
better
the
old
man
well
he
has
been
like
father
to
me
and
my
mother
and
we
are
indians
my
brothers
too
they
work
for
him
so
if
you
like
my
boss
and
his
old
man
george
sea
otter
would
go
to
hell
for
you
pretty
quick
you
bet
you
my
life
you
a
very
good
boy
george
she
replied
with
difficulty
repressing
a
smile
at
his
blunt
but
earnest
avowal
i
am
glad
the
cardigans
have
such
an
honest
loyal
george
sea
otter
dark
face
lighted
with
a
quick
smile
now
you
pay
me
he
replied
and
returned
to
the
car
the
door
opened
and
a
swedish
maid
stood
in
the
entrance
regarding
her
stolidly
i
miss
sumner
shirley
informed
her
this
is
my
maid
marcelle
help
her
in
with
the
she
stepped
into
the
hall
and
called
ship
ahoy
an
answering
call
came
to
her
from
the
dining
room
across
the
and
an
instant
later
colonel
seth
pennington
stood
in
the
doorway
bless
my
whiskers
is
that
you
my
dear
he
cried
and
advanced
to
greet
her
why
how
did
you
get
here
shirley
i
thought
you
missed
the
she
presented
her
cheek
for
his
kiss
so
i
did
uncle
but
a
nice
young
man
named
bryce
cardigan
found
me
in
distress
at
red
bluff
picked
me
up
in
his
car
and
brought
me
she
sniffed
adorably
i
so
hungry
she
declared
and
here
i
am
just
in
time
for
dinner
is
my
name
in
the
pot
it
is
shirley
but
it
soon
will
be
how
perfectly
bully
to
have
you
with
me
again
my
dear
and
what
a
charming
young
lady
you
grown
to
be
since
i
saw
you
last
you
why
you
been
crying
by
jove
i
had
no
idea
you
be
so
glad
to
see
me
she
could
not
forego
a
sly
little
smile
at
his
egoism
you
looking
perfectly
splendid
uncle
seth
she
parried
and
i
feeling
perfectly
splendid
this
is
a
wonderful
country
shirley
and
everything
is
going
nicely
with
me
here
by
the
way
who
did
you
say
picked
you
up
in
his
car
bryce
cardigan
do
you
know
him
no
we
have
met
son
of
old
john
cardigan
i
dare
say
i
heard
of
him
he
been
away
from
sequoia
for
quite
a
while
i
yes
he
was
abroad
for
two
years
after
he
was
graduated
from
well
it
about
time
he
came
home
to
take
care
of
that
old
father
of
he
stepped
to
the
bell
and
pressed
it
and
the
butler
answered
set
a
place
at
dinner
for
miss
shirley
james
he
ordered
thelma
will
show
you
your
rooms
shirley
i
was
just
about
to
sit
down
to
dinner
i
wait
for
while
shirley
was
in
the
living
room
colonel
pennington
features
wore
an
expression
almost
pontifical
but
when
she
had
gone
the
atmosphere
of
paternalism
and
affection
which
he
radiated
faded
instantly
the
colonel
face
was
in
repose
now
cold
calculating
vaguely
repellent
he
scowled
slightly
now
is
that
the
devil
luck
he
soliloquized
young
cardigan
is
probably
the
only
man
in
sequoia
dashed
awkward
if
they
should
become
interested
in
each
other
at
this
time
everybody
in
town
from
lumberjacks
to
bankers
has
told
me
what
a
fine
fellow
bryce
cardigan
is
they
say
he
certainly
he
is
educated
and
has
acquired
some
worldly
polish
just
the
kind
of
young
fellow
shirley
will
find
interesting
and
welcome
company
in
a
town
like
this
many
things
can
happen
in
a
year
and
it
will
be
a
year
before
i
can
smash
the
cardigans
damn
it
chapter
vii
along
the
streets
of
sequoia
bryce
cardigan
and
his
father
walked
arm
in
arm
their
progress
continuously
interrupted
by
but
impulsive
sequoians
who
insisted
upon
halting
the
pair
to
shake
hands
with
bryce
and
bid
him
welcome
home
in
the
presence
of
those
third
parties
the
old
man
quickly
conquered
the
agitation
he
had
felt
at
this
meeting
with
his
son
and
when
presently
they
left
the
business
section
of
the
town
and
turned
into
a
street
his
emotion
assumed
the
character
of
a
quiet
joy
evidenced
in
a
more
erect
bearing
and
a
firmer
tread
as
if
he
strove
despite
his
years
not
to
appear
incongruous
as
he
walked
beside
his
splendid
son
i
wish
i
could
see
you
more
clearly
he
said
presently
his
voice
as
well
as
his
words
expressed
profound
regret
but
there
was
no
hint
of
despair
or
heartbreak
now
bryce
who
up
to
this
moment
had
refrained
from
discussing
his
misfortunes
drew
the
old
man
a
little
closer
to
his
side
what
wrong
with
your
eyes
pal
he
queried
he
did
not
often
address
his
parent
after
the
fashion
of
most
sons
as
father
dad
or
they
were
closer
to
each
other
than
that
and
a
rare
sense
of
perfect
comradeship
found
expression
on
bryce
part
in
such
salutations
as
pal
partner
and
infrequently
old
when
arguing
with
his
father
protesting
with
him
or
affectionately
scolding
him
bryce
with
mock
seriousness
sometimes
called
the
old
man
john
cardigan
cataracts
son
his
father
answered
merely
the
penalty
of
old
but
ca
something
be
done
about
it
demanded
bryce
ca
they
be
cured
somehow
or
other
certainly
they
can
but
i
shall
have
to
wait
until
they
are
completely
matured
and
i
have
become
completely
blind
then
a
specialist
will
perform
an
operation
on
my
eyes
and
in
all
probability
my
sight
will
be
restored
for
a
few
years
however
i
have
given
the
matter
a
great
deal
of
consideration
at
my
age
one
does
find
very
much
difficulty
in
making
the
best
of
everything
and
i
am
about
ready
to
quit
now
like
to
in
fact
i
oh
but
you
ca
quit
until
you
seen
your
redwoods
again
bryce
reminded
him
i
suppose
it
been
a
long
time
since
you
visited
the
valley
of
the
giants
your
long
exile
from
the
has
made
you
a
trifle
gloomy
i
john
cardigan
nodded
i
have
seen
them
in
a
year
and
a
half
bryce
last
time
i
was
up
i
slipped
between
the
logs
on
the
old
and
like
to
broke
my
old
fool
neck
but
even
that
was
warning
enough
for
me
i
cracked
right
on
into
the
timber
and
got
lost
poor
old
partner
and
what
did
you
do
about
it
the
sensible
thing
my
boy
i
just
sat
down
under
a
tree
and
waited
for
george
sea
otter
to
trail
me
and
bring
me
and
did
he
find
you
or
did
you
have
to
spend
the
night
in
the
woods
john
cardigan
smiled
humorously
i
did
not
along
about
sunset
george
found
me
seems
he
been
following
me
all
the
time
and
when
i
sat
down
he
waited
to
make
certain
whether
i
was
lost
or
just
taking
a
rest
where
i
could
be
quiet
and
i
been
leaving
to
an
indian
the
fulfillment
of
my
duty
bryce
murmured
bitterly
no
no
son
you
have
never
been
deficient
in
that
the
old
man
protested
why
did
you
have
the
old
planked
with
refuse
lumber
so
you
would
fall
through
and
you
might
have
had
the
swamp
a
new
trail
into
the
timber
and
fence
it
on
both
sides
in
order
that
you
might
feel
your
way
yes
quite
true
admitted
the
old
man
but
then
i
do
spend
money
quite
as
freely
as
i
used
to
bryce
i
consider
carefully
now
before
i
part
with
a
pal
it
was
fair
of
you
to
make
me
stay
away
so
long
if
i
had
only
known
if
i
had
remotely
suspected
you
have
spoiled
everything
of
course
do
scold
me
son
all
i
have
now
and
i
could
bear
to
send
for
you
until
you
had
your
his
trembling
old
hand
crept
over
and
closed
upon
his
hand
so
firm
but
free
from
signs
of
toil
it
was
my
pleasure
bryce
he
continued
and
you
would
deny
me
my
choice
of
sport
would
you
remember
lad
i
never
had
a
boyhood
i
never
had
a
college
education
and
the
only
real
travel
i
have
ever
had
was
when
i
worked
my
way
around
cape
horn
as
a
foremast
hand
and
all
i
saw
then
was
water
and
hardships
all
i
seen
since
is
my
little
world
here
in
sequoia
and
in
san
you
sacrificed
enough
too
much
for
me
it
pleased
me
to
give
you
all
the
advantages
i
wanted
and
afford
until
i
was
too
old
and
too
busy
to
consider
them
besides
it
was
your
mother
wish
we
made
plans
for
you
before
you
were
born
and
i
promised
her
ah
well
why
be
a
i
knew
i
could
manage
until
you
were
ready
to
settle
down
to
business
and
you
have
enjoyed
your
little
run
have
you
he
concluded
wistfully
i
have
bryce
great
hand
closed
over
the
back
of
his
father
neck
he
shook
the
old
man
with
mock
ferocity
stubborn
old
lumberjack
he
chided
john
cardigan
shook
with
an
inward
chuckle
for
the
loving
abuse
his
boy
had
formed
a
habit
of
heaping
on
him
never
failed
to
thrill
him
instinctively
bryce
had
realized
that
obvious
sympathy
copiously
expressed
was
not
the
medicine
for
his
father
bruised
spirit
hence
he
elected
to
regard
the
latter
blindness
as
a
mere
temporary
annoyance
something
to
be
considered
lightly
if
at
all
and
it
was
typical
of
him
now
that
the
subject
had
been
discussed
briefly
to
resolve
never
to
refer
to
it
again
he
released
his
hold
on
the
old
man
neck
and
tapped
the
latter
gray
head
lightly
while
with
his
tongue
he
made
noises
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
ha
i
thought
so
he
declared
after
your
years
in
the
lumber
business
your
head
has
become
packed
with
sawdust
be
serious
and
talk
to
me
i
ought
to
send
you
to
bed
without
your
supper
talk
to
you
you
bet
i
talk
to
you
john
cardigan
and
i
tell
you
things
too
you
scandalous
morning
i
going
to
put
a
pair
of
overalls
on
you
arm
you
with
a
tin
can
and
a
swab
and
set
you
to
greasing
the
skidways
partner
you
deceived
oh
nonsense
if
i
had
whimpered
that
would
only
have
spoiled
nevertheless
you
were
forced
to
cable
me
to
hurry
i
summoned
you
the
instant
i
realized
i
was
going
to
need
no
you
did
john
cardigan
you
summoned
me
because
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
you
were
panicky
and
let
yourself
get
out
of
his
father
nodded
slowly
and
you
are
over
it
yet
bryee
continued
his
voice
no
longer
bantering
but
lowered
affectionately
what
the
trouble
dad
trot
out
your
old
panic
and
let
me
inspect
it
trouble
must
be
very
real
when
it
gets
my
father
on
the
it
is
bryce
very
real
indeed
as
i
remarked
before
i
lost
your
heritage
for
he
sighed
i
waited
till
you
would
be
able
to
come
home
and
settle
down
to
business
now
you
home
and
there
is
any
business
to
settle
down
bryce
chuckled
for
he
was
indeed
far
from
being
worried
over
business
matters
his
consideration
now
being
entirely
for
his
father
peace
of
mind
all
right
he
retorted
father
has
lost
his
money
and
have
to
let
the
servants
go
and
give
up
the
old
home
that
part
of
it
is
settled
and
weak
anemic
tenderly
nurtured
little
bryce
cardigan
must
put
his
turkey
on
his
back
and
go
into
the
woods
looking
for
a
job
as
lumberjack
busted
eh
did
i
or
did
i
not
hear
the
six
whistle
blow
at
the
mill
bet
you
a
dollar
i
oh
i
have
title
to
everything
how
i
do
have
to
dig
for
good
news
then
it
appears
we
still
have
a
business
indeed
we
may
always
have
a
business
for
the
very
fact
that
it
is
going
but
not
quite
gone
implies
a
doubt
as
to
its
ultimate
departure
and
perhaps
we
may
yet
scheme
a
way
to
retain
oh
my
boy
when
i
think
of
my
years
of
toil
and
scheming
of
the
big
dreams
i
dreamed
belay
all
if
we
can
save
enough
out
of
the
wreck
to
insure
you
your
customary
home
comforts
i
sha
cry
partner
i
have
a
profession
to
fall
back
on
yes
sirree
i
own
a
and
it
says
i
an
electrical
and
civil
what
i
said
it
an
electrical
and
civil
engineer
slipped
one
over
on
you
at
college
john
cardigan
when
all
the
time
you
thought
i
was
having
a
good
time
thought
i
come
home
and
surprise
it
drives
me
wild
to
have
a
man
sputter
at
me
i
an
electrical
and
civil
engineer
i
tell
you
and
my
two
years
of
travel
have
been
spent
studying
the
installation
and
construction
of
big
plants
he
commenced
to
chuckle
softly
i
known
for
years
that
our
sawmill
was
a
debilitated
old
and
would
have
to
be
rebuilt
so
i
wanted
to
know
how
to
rebuild
it
and
i
known
for
years
that
some
day
i
might
have
to
build
a
logging
railroad
my
dear
boy
and
you
got
your
degree
partner
i
have
a
string
of
letters
after
my
name
like
the
tail
of
a
you
comfort
me
the
old
man
answered
simply
i
have
reproached
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
reared
you
with
the
sole
thought
of
making
a
lumberman
out
of
you
and
when
i
saw
your
lumber
business
slipping
through
my
fingers
you
were
sorry
i
did
have
a
profession
to
fall
back
on
eh
or
were
you
fearful
lest
you
had
raised
the
usual
rich
man
son
if
the
latter
you
did
not
compliment
me
pal
i
never
forgotten
how
hard
you
always
strove
to
impress
me
with
a
sense
of
the
exact
weight
of
my
responsibility
as
your
how
big
are
you
now
his
father
queried
suddenly
well
sir
bryce
answered
for
his
father
pleasure
putting
aside
his
normal
modesty
i
six
feet
two
inches
tall
and
i
weigh
two
hundred
pounds
in
the
pink
of
condition
i
have
a
chest

and
a
half
inches
and
a
reach
as
long
as
a
gorilla
my
underpinning
is
good
too
i
not
one
of
these
fellows
with
spidery
legs
and
a
i
can
do
a
hundred
yards
in
ten
seconds
i
no
slouch
of
a
swimmer
and
at
princeton
they
say
i
made
football
history
and
in
spite
of
it
all
i
have
an
athletic
that
is
very
encouraging
my
boy
very
ever
do
any
boxing
quite
a
little
i
fairly
up
in
the
manly
art
of
that
good
and
i
suppose
you
did
some
wrestling
at
your
college
gymnasium
did
you
not
naturally
i
went
in
for
everything
my
big
carcass
could
the
old
man
wagged
his
head
approvingly
and
they
had
reached
the
gate
of
the
cardigan
home
before
he
spoke
again
there
a
big
buck
up
in
pennington
camp
he
remarked
irrelevantly
he
a
french
canadian
imported
from
northern
michigan
by
colonel
pennington
i
dare
say
he
the
only
man
in
this
country
who
measures
up
to
you
physically
he
can
fight
with
his
fists
and
wrestle
right
cleverly
told
his
name
is
jules
rondeau
and
he
top
dog
among
the
lumberjacks
they
say
he
the
strongest
man
in
the
he
unlatched
the
gate
folks
used
to
say
that
about
me
once
he
continued
wistfully
ah
if
i
could
have
my
eyes
to
see
you
meet
jules
rondeau
the
front
portal
of
the
quaint
old
cardigan
residence
opened
and
a
lady
came
out
on
the
porch
and
hailed
bryce
she
was
tully
john
cardigan
old
housekeeper
and
almost
a
mother
to
bryce
oh
here
my
boy
she
cried
and
a
moment
later
found
herself
encircled
by
bryce
arms
and
saluted
with
a
hearty
kiss
as
he
stepped
into
the
familiar
bryce
paused
raised
his
head
and
sniffed
suspiciously
like
a
tully
arms
akimbo
watched
him
pleasurably
i
smell
something
he
declared
and
advanced
a
step
down
the
hall
for
another
sniff
then
in
exact
imitation
of
a
foxhound
he
gave
tongue
and
started
for
the
kitchen
tully
waddling
after
found
him
pointing
two
hot
blackberry
pies
which
had
but
a
few
minutes
previous
been
taken
from
the
oven
he
was
baying
lugubriously
they
wild
blackberries
too
tully
announced
pridefully
i
remembered
how
fond
you
used
to
be
of
pie
so
i
phoned
up
to
the
and
had
the
send
a
man
out
to
pick
i
still
a
tully
and
you
still
the
same
dear
thoughtful
soul
i
so
glad
now
that
i
had
sense
enough
to
think
of
you
before
i
turned
my
footsteps
toward
the
setting
he
patted
her
gray
head
mrs
he
declared
i
brought
you
a
nice
big
collar
of
irish
lace
bought
it
in
belfast
it
comes
down
around
your
neck
and
buckles
right
here
with
an
old
ivory
cameo
i
picked
up
in
burma
and
which
formerly
was
the
property
of
a
hindu
tully
simpered
with
pleasure
and
protested
that
her
boy
was
too
kind
you
have
changed
a
single
speck
she
concluded
proudly
has
the
pie
i
should
say
how
many
did
you
make
may
i
have
one
all
for
myself
tully
indeed
you
may
my
thank
you
but
i
do
not
want
it
for
myself
tully
will
you
please
wrap
one
of
those
wonderful
pies
in
a
napkin
and
the
instant
george
sea
otter
comes
in
with
the
car
tell
him
to
take
the
pie
over
to
colonel
pennington
house
and
deliver
it
to
miss
sumner
there
a
girl
who
doubtless
thinks
she
has
tasted
pie
in
her
day
and
i
want
to
prove
to
her
that
she
he
selected
a
card
from
his
sat
down
and
wrote
dear
miss
sumner
here
is
a
priceless
hot
pie
especially
manufactured
in
my
honour
it
is
so
good
i
wanted
you
to
have
some
in
all
your
life
you
have
never
tasted
anything
like
it
sincerely
bryce
cardigan
he
handed
the
card
to
tully
and
repaired
to
his
old
room
to
remove
the
stains
of
travel
before
joining
his
father
at
dinner
some
twenty
minutes
later
his
unusual
votive
offering
was
delivered
by
george
sea
otter
to
colonel
pennington
swedish
maid
who
promptly
brought
it
in
to
the
colonel
and
shirley
sumner
who
were
even
then
at
dinner
in
the
colonel
fine
dining
room
miss
sumner
amazement
was
so
profound
that
for
fully
a
minute
she
was
mute
contenting
herself
with
scrutinizing
alternately
the
pie
and
the
card
that
accompanied
it
presently
she
handed
the
card
to
her
uncle
who
affixed
his
and
read
the
epistle
with
deliberation
is
this
young
cardigan
a
truly
remarkable
young
man
shirley
he
declared
why
i
have
never
heard
of
anything
like
his
astounding
action
if
he
had
sent
you
over
an
armful
of
american
beauty
roses
from
his
father
garden
i
could
understand
it
but
an
infernal
blackberry
pie
good
heavens
i
told
you
he
was
different
she
replied
to
the
colonel
amazement
she
did
not
appear
at
all
amused
colonel
pennington
poked
a
fork
through
the
delicate
brown
crust
i
wonder
if
it
is
really
as
good
as
he
says
it
is
of
course
if
it
was
he
would
have
sent
how
do
you
know
by
intuition
she
replied
and
she
cut
into
the
pie
and
helped
the
colonel
to
a
quadrant
of
it
that
was
a
genuine
hayseed
announced
the
colonel
a
few
moments
later
as
shirley
was
pouring
coffee
from
a
percolator
in
the
library
the
idea
of
anybody
who
has
enjoyed
the
advantages
that
fellow
has
sending
a
hot
blackberry
pie
to
a
girl
he
has
just
met
yes
the
idea
she
echoed
i
find
it
rather
you
mean
i
said
bryce
cardigan
is
a
man
with
the
heart
and
soul
of
a
boy
and
i
think
it
was
mighty
sweet
of
him
to
share
his
pie
with
me
if
he
had
sent
roses
i
should
have
suspected
him
of
trying
to
me
but
the
fact
that
he
sent
a
blackberry
pie
proves
that
he
just
a
natural
simple
sane
original
citizen
just
the
kind
of
person
a
girl
can
have
for
a
dear
friend
without
incurring
the
risk
of
having
to
marry
i
repeat
that
this
is
most
only
because
it
is
an
unusual
thing
for
a
young
man
to
do
although
after
all
why
should
he
send
me
a
blackberry
pie
if
he
thought
a
blackberry
pie
would
please
me
more
than
an
armful
of
roses
besides
he
may
send
the
roses
most
extraordinary
the
colonel
reiterated
what
should
one
expect
from
such
an
extraordinary
creature
he
an
extraordinary
young
man
with
an
extraordinary
scowl
and
an
extraordinary
crinkly
smile
that
is
friendly
and
generous
and
free
from
masculine
guile
why
i
think
he
just
the
kind
of
man
who
would
send
a
girl
a
blackberry
the
colonel
noticed
a
calm
little
smile
fringing
her
generous
mouth
he
wished
he
could
tell
by
intuition
what
she
was
thinking
about
and
what
effect
a
hot
pie
was
ultimately
to
have
upon
the
value
of
his
minority
holding
in
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
chapter
ix
not
until
dinner
was
finished
and
father
and
son
had
repaired
to
the
library
for
their
coffee
and
cigars
did
bryce
cardigan
advert
to
the
subject
of
his
father
business
affairs
well
john
cardigan
he
declared
comfortably
is
friday
i
spend
saturday
and
sunday
in
sinful
sloth
and
the
renewal
of
old
acquaintance
and
on
monday
i
sit
in
at
your
desk
and
give
you
a
vacation
how
about
that
programme
pard
our
affairs
are
in
such
shape
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
hurt
or
bettered
no
matter
who
takes
charge
of
them
now
cardigan
replied
bitterly
we
about
through
i
waited
too
long
and
trusted
too
far
and
now
well
in
a
year
we
be
out
of
suppose
you
start
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
everything
right
to
the
end
george
sea
otter
informed
me
that
you
been
having
trouble
with
this
colonel
pennington
is
he
the
man
who
has
us
where
the
hair
is
short
the
old
man
nodded
the
squaw
creek
timber
deal
eh
bryce
suggested
again
the
old
man
nodded
you
wrote
me
all
about
that
bryce
continued
you
had
him
blocked
whichever
way
he
turned
so
effectually
blocked
in
fact
that
the
only
pleasure
he
has
derived
from
his
investment
since
is
the
knowledge
that
he
owns
two
thousand
acres
of
timber
with
the
exclusive
right
to
pay
taxes
on
it
walk
in
it
look
at
it
and
admire
it
in
fact
do
everything
except
log
it
mill
it
and
realize
on
his
investment
it
must
make
him
feel
like
a
bally
on
the
other
hand
his
father
reminded
him
no
matter
what
the
colonel
feeling
on
that
score
may
be
misery
loves
company
and
not
until
i
had
pulled
out
of
the
squaw
creek
country
and
started
logging
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
did
i
realize
that
i
had
been
considerable
of
a
jackass
yes
bryce
admitted
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
you
cut
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
there
was
silence
between
them
for
several
minutes
bryce
thoughts
harked
back
to
that
first
season
of
logging
in
the
san
hedrin
when
the
had
caught
the
river
filled
with
cardigan
logs
and
whirled
them
down
to
the
bay
to
crash
through
the
at
tidewater
and
continue
out
to
the
open
sea
in
his
mind
eye
he
could
still
see
the
figures
on
the
statement
sinclair
his
manager
had
presented
at
the
end
of
that
year
the
old
man
appeared
to
divine
the
trend
of
his
son
thoughts
yes
bryce
that
was
a
disastrous
year
he
declared
the
mere
loss
of
the
logs
was
a
severe
blow
but
in
addition
i
had
to
pay
out
quite
a
little
money
to
settle
with
my
customers
i
was
loaded
up
with
orders
that
year
although
i
did
expect
to
make
any
money
the
orders
were
merely
taken
to
keep
the
men
employed
you
understand
bryce
i
had
a
good
crew
the
finest
in
the
country
and
if
i
had
shut
down
my
men
would
have
scattered
and
well
you
know
how
hard
it
is
to
get
that
kind
of
a
crew
together
again
besides
i
had
never
failed
my
boys
before
and
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
failing
them
then
half
the
mills
in
the
country
were
shut
down
at
the
time
and
there
was
a
lot
of
distress
among
the
unemployed
i
could
do
it
bryce
nodded
and
when
you
lost
the
logs
you
could
fill
those
orders
then
the
market
commenced
to
jump
and
advanced
three
dollars
in
three
months
exactly
my
son
and
my
customers
began
to
crowd
me
to
fill
those
old
orders
praise
be
my
regular
customers
knew
i
was
the
kind
of
lumberman
who
tries
to
crawl
out
of
filling
orders
after
the
market
has
gone
up
nevertheless
i
could
expect
them
to
suffer
with
me
my
failure
to
perform
my
contracts
while
unavoidable
nevertheless
would
have
caused
them
a
severe
loss
and
when
they
were
forced
to
buy
elsewhere
i
paid
them
the
difference
between
the
price
they
paid
my
competitors
and
the
price
at
which
they
originally
placed
their
orders
with
me
and
the
delay
in
delivery
caused
them
further
how
much
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
to
settle
for
losses
to
my
local
customers
alone
among
my
orders
i
had
three
million
feet
of
clear
lumber
for
shipment
to
the
united
kingdom
and
these
foreign
customers
thinking
i
was
trying
to
crawfish
on
my
contracts
sued
me
and
got
judgment
for
actual
and
exemplary
damages
for
my
failure
to
perform
while
the
demurrage
on
the
ships
they
sent
to
freight
the
lumber
sent
me
hustling
to
the
bank
to
borrow
he
smoked
meditatively
for
a
minute
i
always
been
he
explained
apologetically
never
kept
much
of
a
reserve
for
emergencies
you
know
whenever
i
had
idle
money
i
put
it
into
timber
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
because
i
realized
that
some
day
the
railroad
would
build
in
from
the
south
tap
that
timber
and
double
its
value
i
not
as
yet
found
reason
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
my
course
but
he
sighed
the
railroad
is
a
long
time
coming
john
cardigan
here
spoke
of
a
most
important
factor
in
the
situation
the
crying
need
of
the
country
was
a
feeder
to
some
transcontinental
railroad
by
reason
of
natural
barriers
humboldt
county
was
not
easily
accessible
to
the
outside
world
except
from
the
sea
and
even
this
avenue
of
ingress
and
egress
would
be
closed
for
days
at
a
stretch
when
the
harbour
bar
was
on
a
rampage
with
the
exception
of
a
strip
of
level
fertile
land
perhaps
five
miles
wide
and
thirty
miles
long
and
contiguous
to
the
seacoast
the
heavily
timbered
mountains
to
the
north
east
and
south
rendered
the
building
of
a
railroad
that
would
connect
humboldt
county
with
the
outside
world
a
profoundly
difficult
and
expensive
task
the
northwestern
pacific
indeed
had
been
slowly
building
from
san
francisco
bay
up
through
marin
and
sonoma
counties
to
willits
in
mendocino
county
but
there
it
had
stuck
to
await
that
indefinite
day
when
its
finances
and
the
courage
of
its
board
of
directors
should
prove
equal
to
the
colossal
task
of
continuing
the
road
two
hundred
miles
through
the
mountains
to
sequoia
on
humboldt
bay
for
twenty
years
the
humboldt
pioneers
had
lived
in
hope
of
this
but
eventually
they
had
died
in
despair
or
were
in
process
of
doing
so
do
worry
dad
it
will
come
bryce
assured
his
father
it
bound
yes
but
not
in
my
day
and
when
it
comes
a
stranger
may
own
your
san
hedrin
timber
and
reap
the
reward
of
my
lifetime
of
again
a
silence
fell
between
them
broken
presently
by
the
old
man
that
was
a
mistake
logging
in
the
san
hedrin
he
observed
i
had
my
lesson
that
first
year
but
i
did
heed
it
if
i
had
abandoned
my
camps
there
pocketed
my
pride
paid
colonel
pennington
two
dollars
for
his
squaw
creek
timber
and
rebuilt
my
old
i
would
have
been
safe
but
i
was
stubborn
i
played
the
game
so
long
you
know
i
did
want
to
let
that
man
pennington
outgame
me
so
i
tackled
the
san
hedrin
again
we
put
thirty
million
feet
of
logs
into
the
river
that
year
and
when
the
freshet
came
mctavish
managed
to
make
a
fairly
successful
drive
but
he
was
all
winter
on
the
job
and
when
spring
came
and
the
men
went
into
the
woods
again
they
had
to
leave
nearly
a
million
feet
of
heavy
butt
logs
permanently
stranded
in
the
slack
water
along
the
banks
while
perhaps
another
million
feet
of
lighter
logs
had
been
lifted
out
of
the
channel
by
the
overflow
and
left
high
and
dry
when
the
water
receded
there
they
were
bryce
scattered
up
and
down
the
river
far
from
the
cables
and
the
only
power
we
could
use
to
get
those
monsters
back
into
the
river
again
and
i
was
forced
to
decide
whether
they
should
be
abandoned
or
split
during
the
summer
into
railroad
ties
posts
pickets
and
shakes
commodities
for
which
there
was
very
little
call
at
the
time
and
in
which
even
when
sold
there
could
be
no
profit
after
deducting
the
cost
of
the
wagon
haul
to
sequoia
and
the
water
freight
from
sequoia
to
market
so
i
abandoned
i
remember
that
phase
of
it
to
log
it
the
third
year
only
meant
that
more
of
those
heavy
logs
would
jam
and
spell
more
loss
besides
there
was
always
danger
of
another
which
would
put
me
out
of
business
completely
and
i
could
afford
the
that
was
the
time
you
should
have
offered
colonel
pennington
a
handsome
profit
on
his
squaw
creek
timber
if
my
hindsight
was
as
good
as
my
foresight
and
i
had
my
eyesight
i
would
be
in
this
dilemma
at
all
the
old
man
retorted
briskly
hard
to
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks
and
besides
i
was
obsessed
with
the
need
of
protecting
your
heritage
from
attack
in
any
john
cardigan
straightened
up
in
his
chair
and
laid
the
tip
of
his
right
index
finger
in
the
centre
of
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
here
was
the
situation
bryce
the
centre
of
my
palm
represents
sequoia
the
end
of
my
fingers
represents
the
san
hedrin
timber
twenty
miles
south
now
if
the
railroad
built
in
from
the
south
you
would
win
but
if
it
built
in
from
grant
pass
oregon
on
the
north
from
the
base
of
my
hand
the
terminus
of
the
line
would
be
sequoia
twenty
miles
from
your
timber
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
bryce
nodded
in
which
event
he
replied
we
would
be
in
much
the
same
position
with
our
san
hedrin
timber
as
colonel
pennington
is
with
his
squaw
creek
timber
we
would
have
the
comforting
knowledge
that
we
owned
it
and
paid
taxes
on
it
but
could
do
a
thing
with
it
right
you
are
the
thing
to
do
then
as
i
viewed
the
situation
bryce
was
to
acquire
a
body
of
timber
north
of
sequoia
and
be
prepared
for
either
eventuality
and
this
i
silence
again
descended
upon
them
and
bryce
gazing
into
the
open
fireplace
recalled
an
event
in
that
period
of
his
father
activities
old
bill
henderson
had
come
up
to
their
house
to
dinner
one
night
and
quite
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
his
soup
the
old
fox
had
glared
across
at
his
host
and
bellowed
john
i
hear
you
bought
six
thousand
acres
up
in
township
john
cardigan
had
merely
nodded
and
henderson
had
continued
going
to
log
it
or
hold
it
for
investment
it
was
a
good
buy
cardigan
had
replied
enigmatically
so
i
thought
i
better
take
it
at
the
price
i
suppose
bryce
will
log
it
some
then
i
wish
bryce
was
such
a
boy
john
see
here
now
neighbour
i
up
i
took
that
money
pennington
gave
me
for
my
squaw
creek
timber
and
put
it
back
into
redwood
in
township
nine
up
against
your
holdings
there
john
i
build
a
mill
on
tidewater
if
you
sell
me
a
site
and
i
log
my
timber
if
i
sell
you
a
bill
and
i
wo
stab
you
to
the
heart
either
consider
that
that
bully
john
but
still
you
only
dispose
of
part
of
my
troubles
there
twelve
miles
of
to
build
to
get
my
logs
to
the
mill
and
i
have
enough
ready
money
to
make
the
grade
better
throw
in
with
me
john
and
we
build
the
road
and
operate
it
for
our
joint
i
not
throw
in
with
you
bill
at
my
time
of
life
i
do
want
to
have
the
worry
of
building
maintaining
and
operating
twelve
miles
of
private
railroad
but
i
loan
you
without
security
you
have
to
take
an
unsecured
note
john
everything
i
got
is
the
money
you
need
to
build
and
equip
the
road
finished
cardigan
in
return
you
are
to
shoulder
all
the
grief
and
worry
of
the
road
and
give
me
a
contract
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
per
thousand
feet
to
haul
my
logs
down
to
tidewater
with
your
own
my
minimum
haul
will
be
million
feet
annually
and
my
maximum
fifty
million
sold
cried
henderson
and
it
was
even
so
bryce
came
out
of
his
reverie
and
now
he
queried
of
his
father
i
mortgaged
the
san
hedrin
timber
in
the
south
to
buy
the
timber
in
the
north
my
son
then
after
i
commenced
logging
in
my
new
holdings
came
several
long
lean
years
of
famine
i
stuck
it
out
hoping
for
a
change
for
the
better
i
could
bear
to
close
down
my
mill
and
for
the
reason
that
i
could
stand
the
loss
far
more
readily
than
the
men
who
worked
for
me
and
depended
upon
me
but
the
market
dragged
in
the
doldrums
and
bill
henderson
died
and
his
boys
got
discouraged
and
a
sudden
flash
of
inspiration
illumined
bryce
cardigan
brain
and
they
sold
out
to
colonel
pennington
he
cried
exactly
the
colonel
took
over
my
contract
with
henderson
company
along
with
the
other
assets
and
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
as
assignee
to
fulfill
the
contract
for
the
past
two
years
the
market
for
redwood
has
been
most
gratifying
and
if
i
could
only
have
gotten
a
maximum
supply
of
logs
over
pennington
road
i
have
worked
out
of
the
hole
but
he
manages
to
hold
you
to
a
minimum
annual
haul
of
million
feet
eh
john
cardigan
nodded
he
claims
he
short
of
that
wrecks
and
fires
have
embarrassed
the
road
he
can
always
find
excuses
for
failing
to
spot
in
for
cardigan
logs
bill
henderson
never
played
the
game
that
way
he
gave
me
what
i
wanted
and
never
held
me
to
the
minimum
haulage
when
i
was
prepared
to
give
him
the
what
does
colonel
pennington
want
pard
he
wants
said
john
cardigan
slowly
my
valley
of
the
giants
and
a
right
of
way
through
my
land
from
the
valley
to
a
on
deep
and
you
refused
him
naturally
you
know
my
ideas
on
that
big
his
old
head
sank
low
on
his
breast
folks
call
them
cardigan
redwoods
now
he
murmured
cardigan
redwoods
and
pennington
would
cut
them
oh
bryce
the
man
has
a
soul
but
i
fail
to
see
what
the
loss
of
cardigan
redwoods
has
to
do
with
the
impending
ruin
of
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
his
son
reminded
him
we
have
all
the
timber
we
my
contract
has
but
one
more
year
to
run
and
recently
i
tried
to
get
pennington
to
renew
it
he
was
very
nice
and
sociable
but
he
named
me
a
for
a
renewal
of
the
contract
for
five
years
of
three
dollars
per
thousand
feet
that
rate
is
prohibitive
and
puts
us
out
of
not
necessarily
bryce
returned
evenly
how
about
the
state
railroad
commission
has
it
got
something
to
say
about
rates
yes
on
common
carriers
but
pennington
load
is
a
private
my
contract
will
expire
next
year
and
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
pennington
to
renew
it
and
one
ca
operate
a
sawmill
without
logs
you
then
said
bryce
calmly
we
shut
the
mill
down
when
the
contract
expires
hold
our
timber
as
an
investment
and
live
the
simple
life
until
we
can
sell
it
or
a
transcontinental
road
builds
into
humboldt
county
and
enables
us
to
start
up
the
mill
john
cardigan
shook
his
head
i
mortgaged
to
the
last
penny
he
confessed
and
pennington
has
been
buying
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
bonds
until
he
is
in
control
of
the
issue
buy
in
the
san
hedrin
timber
at
the
foreclosure
sale
and
in
order
to
get
it
back
and
save
something
for
you
out
of
the
wreckage
i
have
to
make
an
unprofitable
trade
with
him
i
have
to
give
him
my
timber
adjoining
his
north
of
sequoia
together
with
my
valley
of
the
giants
in
return
for
the
san
hedrin
timber
to
which
he
have
a
deed
but
the
mill
all
my
old
employees
with
their
numerous
dependents
gone
with
you
left
and
without
a
dollar
to
pay
your
taxes
smashed
like
that
and
he
drove
his
fist
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
perhaps
but
not
without
a
fight
bryce
answered
although
he
knew
their
plight
was
hopeless
i
give
that
man
pennington
a
run
for
his
money
or
i
know
the
the
telephone
on
the
table
beside
him
tinkled
and
he
took
down
the
receiver
and
said
hello
mercy
came
the
clear
sweet
voice
of
shirley
sumner
over
the
wire
do
you
feel
as
savage
as
all
that
cardigan
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
the
thrill
that
was
akin
to
pain
came
to
bryce
cardigan
he
laughed
if
i
had
known
you
were
calling
miss
sumner
he
said
i
should
have
growled
well
you
forgiven
for
several
reasons
but
principally
for
sending
me
that
delicious
blackberry
pie
of
course
it
discoloured
my
teeth
temporarily
but
i
do
care
the
pie
was
worth
it
and
you
were
awfully
dear
to
think
of
sending
it
thank
you
so
glad
you
liked
it
miss
sumner
i
dare
to
hope
that
i
may
have
the
privilege
of
seeing
you
soon
of
course
one
good
pie
deserves
another
some
evening
next
week
when
that
dear
old
daddy
of
yours
can
spare
his
boy
you
might
be
interested
to
see
our
dining
room
uncle
seth
is
so
proud
of
i
too
recent
an
arrival
to
know
the
hour
at
which
uncle
seth
dines
but
i
let
you
know
later
and
name
a
definite
date
would
thursday
night
be
convenient
perfectly
thank
you
a
thousand
she
bade
him
as
he
turned
from
the
telephone
his
father
looked
up
what
are
you
going
to
do
lad
he
queried
i
have
to
do
some
thinking
bryce
answered
so
i
going
up
into
cardigan
redwoods
to
do
it
up
there
a
fellow
can
get
set
as
it
were
to
put
over
a
thought
with
a
punch
in
the
dogwoods
and
rhododendron
are
blooming
now
the
old
man
murmured
wistfully
bryce
knew
what
he
was
thinking
of
i
attend
to
the
flowers
for
mother
he
assured
cardigan
and
he
added
fiercely
and
i
attend
to
the
battle
for
father
we
may
lose
but
that
man
pennington
will
know
he
been
in
a
fight
before
we
fin
he
broke
off
abruptly
for
he
had
just
remembered
that
he
was
to
dine
at
the
pennington
house
the
following
thursday
and
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
who
smilingly
breaks
bread
with
his
enemy
chapter
x
for
many
years
there
had
been
installed
in
cardigan
mill
a
clock
set
to
united
states
observatory
time
and
corrected
hourly
by
the
telegraph
company
it
was
the
only
clock
of
its
kind
in
sequoia
hence
folk
set
their
watches
by
it
or
rather
by
the
whistle
on
cardigan
mill
with
a
due
appreciation
of
the
important
function
of
this
clock
toward
his
old
zeb
curry
the
chief
engineer
and
a
stickler
for
being
on
time
was
most
meticulous
in
his
with
a
sage
and
prophetic
eye
fixed
upon
the
face
of
the
clock
and
a
particularly
greasy
hand
grasping
the
zeb
would
wait
until
the
clock
registered
exactly
and
a
half
whereupon
the
seven
whistle
would
commence
blowing
to
cease
instantly
upon
the
stroke
of
the
hour
it
was
old
zeb
pride
and
boast
that
with
a
single
exception
during
the
sixteen
years
the
clock
had
been
in
service
no
man
could
say
that
zeb
had
been
more
than
a
second
late
or
early
with
his
that
exception
occurred
when
bryce
cardigan
invading
the
engine
room
while
zeb
was
at
luncheon
looped
the
until
the
end
dangled
seven
feet
above
ground
as
a
consequence
zeb
who
was
a
short
fat
little
man
was
forced
to
leap
at
it
several
times
before
success
crowned
his
efforts
and
the
whistle
blew
thereafter
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
his
reason
tottered
on
its
throne
due
to
the
fact
that
bryce
induced
every
mill
employee
to
call
upon
the
engineer
and
remind
him
that
he
must
be
growing
old
since
he
was
no
longer
dependable
on
the
morning
following
bryce
cardigan
return
to
sequoia
zeb
curry
as
per
custom
started
his
engine
at
that
gave
the
huge
bandsaws
two
minutes
in
which
to
attain
their
proper
speed
and
afforded
dan
kenyon
the
head
sawyer
ample
time
to
run
his
steam
out
to
the
end
of
the
track
for
daniel
too
was
a
reliable
man
in
the
matter
of
starting
his
daily
uproar
on
time
at
precisely
six
and
a
half
therefore
the
engineer
hand
closed
over
the
handle
of
the
and
dan
kenyon
standing
on
the
with
his
hand
on
the
lever
took
a
squint
through
a
rather
grimy
window
that
gave
upon
the
and
the
at
the
head
of
it
the
whistle
ceased
blowing
but
still
dan
kenyon
stood
at
his
post
oblivious
of
the
hungry
saws
ten
seconds
passed
then
zeb
curry
immeasurably
scandalized
at
daniel
tardiness
tooted
the
whistle
sharply
twice
whereupon
dan
woke
up
threw
over
the
lever
and
walked
his
log
up
to
the
saw
for
the
next
five
hours
zeb
curry
had
no
opportunity
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
head
sawyer
after
blowing
the
twelve
whistle
however
he
hurried
over
to
the
where
the
mill
hands
already
lined
the
benches
shovelling
food
into
their
mouths
as
only
a
lumberman
or
a
miner
can
dan
kenyon
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
the
place
of
honour
sacred
to
the
head
sawyer
and
when
his
mouth
would
permit
of
some
activity
other
than
mastication
zeb
curry
caught
his
eye
hey
you
dan
kenyon
he
shouted
across
the
table
what
happened
to
you
this
mornin

thirty
years
when
we
was
shut
down
for
repairs
dan
continued
i
looked
through
that
winder
when
john
cardigan
was
away
from
sequoia
to
watch
him
git
to
his
office
on
time
he
there
when
the
whistle
blows
clear
up
to
the
time
his
eyes
go
back
on
him
an
then
he
arrives
late
once
or
twice
on
account
havin
to
go
careful
this
mornin
for
the
first
time
in
fifty
year
he
stays
in
bed
but
his
son
has
the
key
in
the
office
door
when
the
whistle
blows
an
dan
kenyon
paused
abruptly
the
hum
of
conversation
ceased
and
silence
fell
upon
the
room
as
bryce
cardigan
strolled
in
the
door
nodded
to
the
men
and
slid
in
on
the
bench
to
a
seat
beside
the
head
sawyer
hello
dan
hello
zeb
he
said
and
shook
hands
with
each
i
mighty
glad
to
see
you
both

an
he
like
his
daddy

ashamed
to

with
his
men

ai
ashamed
to
eat
with
his
men
nuther
glad

us
again
boy
mighty
glad
dan
here
gittin
an
old
squaw
with
his
work
an
needs
somebody
to
jerk
him
up
while
the
rest
o
these
here
i
noticed
that
about
dan
bryce
interrupted
craftily
he
slowing
up
zeb
he
must
have
been
fifteen
seconds
late
this
morning
or
perhaps
he
added
you
were
fifteen
seconds
earlier
than
the
dan
grinned
and
bryce
went
on
seriously
i
afraid
you
getting
too
old
to
ride
the
dan
you
been
at
it
a
long
time
so
with
the
utmost
good
will
in
the
world
toward
you
you
fired
i
might
as
well
tell
you
now
you
know
me
dan
i
always
did
dislike
beating
about
the
fired
dan
kenyon
eyes
popped
with
amazement
and
horror
fired
after
thirty
years
he
croaked
fired
there
was
unmistakable
finality
in
bryce
tones
you
hired
again
however
at
a
higher
salary
as
you
can
get
away
with
that
job
ca
you
dan
in
fact
he
added
without
waiting
for
the
overjoyed
dan
to
answer
him
you
got
to
get
away
with
it
because
i
discharged
the
i
found
on
the
job
when
i
got
down
here
this
morning
he
been
letting
too
many
profits
go
into
the
in
fact
the
entire
plant
has
gone
to
glory
old
and
rotten
could
stand
a
pressure
and
empty
axes
not
in
their
proper
places
filled
with
stale
chemical
why
the
smallest
kind
of
a
fire
here
would
get
beyond
our
control
with
that
man
on
the
job
besides
he
changed
the
i
found
the
men
putting
clear
boards
with
streaks
in
them
in
with
the
no
clear
the
customer
may
not
kick
at
a
small
percentage
of
no
in
his
no
but
it
only
fair
to
give
it
to
him
at
two
dollars
a
thousand
well
purred
zeb
curry
they
do
grade
lumber
as
strict
nowadays
as
they
used
to
before
you
went
away
colonel
pennington
says
we
a
lot
o
back
numbers
out
this
way
an
too
generous
with
our
grades
first
thing
he
did
was
to
call
a
meetin
of
all
the
humboldt
lumber
manufacturers
an
organize
into
an
association
then
he
had
the
changed
the
retailers
hollered
for
a
while
but
bimeby
they
got
used
to
did
my
father
join
that
association
bryce
demanded
quickly
yes
he
told
pennington
he
was
goin
to
be
no
obstructionist
in
the
trade
but
he
did
kick
like
a
bay
steer
on
them
new
refused
to
conform
to
said
he
was
too
old
an
had
been
too
long
in
business
to
start
gougin
his
customers
at
his
time
o
life
so
he
got
out
o
the
bully
for
john
cardigan
bryce
declared
i
suppose
we
could
make
a
little
more
money
by
cheapening
our
grade
but
the
quality
of
our
lumber
is
so
well
known
that
it
sells
itself
and
saves
us
the
expense
of
maintaining
a
corps
of
from
what
i
hear
tell
o
the
colonel
dan
observed
sagely
the
least
he
ever
wants
is
a
hundred
and
fifty
per
cent
the
best
of
yes
old
zeb
observed
gravely
an
so
fur
as
i
can
see
he
ai
none
too
perticular
how
he
gets
he
helped
himself
to
a
toothpick
and
followed
by
the
head
sawyer
abruptly
left
the
room
after
the
fashion
of
sawmill
men
and
woodsmen
who
eat
as
much
as
they
can
as
quickly
as
they
can
and
eventually
die
of
old
age
rather
than
indigestion
bryce
ate
his
noonday
meal
in
more
leisurely
fashion
and
at
its
conclusion
stepped
into
the
kitchen
where
do
you
live
cook
he
demanded
of
that
functionary
and
upon
being
informed
he
retired
to
the
office
and
called
up
the
sequoia
bryce
cardigan
speaking
he
informed
the
butcher
do
you
ever
buy
any
pigs
from
our
mill
cook
not
any
more
the
butcher
answered
he
stung
me
once
with
a
dozen
fine
shoats
they
looked
great
but
after
i
had
slaughtered
them
and
had
them
dressed
they
turned
out
to
be
hogs
swill
and
thank
bryce
hung
up
i
knew
that
cook
was
wasteful
he
declared
turning
to
his
father
old
manager
one
thomas
sinclair
he
wastes
food
in
order
to
take
the
swill
home
to
his
hogs
and
nobody
watches
him
things
have
certainly
gone
to
the
devil
he
continued
no
fault
of
mine
sinclair
protested
i
never
paid
any
attention
to
matters
outside
the
office
your
father
looked
after
everything
bryce
looked
at
sinclair
the
latter
was
a
thin
spare
nervous
man
in
the
late
fifties
and
though
generally
credited
with
being
john
cardigan
manager
bryce
knew
that
sinclair
was
in
reality
little
more
than
a
glorified
bookkeeper
and
a
very
excellent
bookkeeper
indeed
bryce
realized
that
in
the
colossal
task
that
confronted
him
he
could
expect
no
real
help
from
sinclair
yes
he
replied
my
father
looked
after
everything
else
while
he
oh
you
soon
get
the
business
straightened
out
and
running
smoothly
again
sinclair
declared
confidently
well
i
glad
i
started
on
the
job
rather
than
next
monday
as
i
planned
to
do
last
he
stepped
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
a
big
steam
schooner
and
a
lay
in
the
lee
of
the
piles
of
lumber
sailors
and
tallymen
and
timekeeper
lounged
enjoying
the
brief
period
of
the
noon
hour
still
theirs
before
the
driving
mates
of
the
should
turn
them
to
on
the
job
once
more
to
his
right
and
left
stretched
the
drying
yard
gangway
on
gangway
formed
by
the
serried
rows
of
the
placidly
feeding
from
their
nosebags
while
the
fellows
who
piled
the
lumber
sat
about
in
little
groups
conversing
with
the
as
bryce
looked
a
puff
of
white
steam
appeared
over
the
roof
of
the
old
sawmill
and
the
one
whistle
blew
instantly
that
scene
of
indolence
and
ease
turned
to
one
of
activity
the
lounging
in
the
gangways
scurried
for
their
stations
in
the
mill
men
climbed
to
the
tops
of
the
while
other
men
passed
boards
and
scantlings
up
to
them
the
aboard
the
vessels
rattled
the
of
the
steam
schooner
swung
outward
and
a
moment
later
two
great
of
newly
sawed
lumber
rose
in
the
air
swung
inward
and
descended
to
the
steamer
decks
all
about
bryce
were
scenes
of
activity
of
human
endeavour
and
to
him
in
that
moment
came
the
thought
my
father
brought
all
this
to
pass
and
now
the
task
of
continuing
it
is
mine
all
those
men
who
earn
a
living
in
cardigan
mill
and
on
cardigan
dock
those
sailors
who
sail
the
ships
that
carry
cardigan
lumber
into
the
distant
marts
of
men
are
dependent
upon
me
and
my
father
used
to
tell
me
not
to
fail
them
must
my
father
have
wrought
all
this
in
vain
and
must
i
stand
by
and
see
all
this
go
to
satisfy
the
overwhelming
ambition
of
a
stranger
his
big
hands
clenched
no
he
growled
savagely
if
i
stick
around
this
office
a
minute
longer
i
go
crazy
bryce
snarled
then
give
me
your
last
five
annual
statements
sinclair
the
old
servitor
brought
forth
the
documents
in
question
bryce
stuffed
them
into
his
pocket
and
left
the
office
three
quarters
of
an
hour
later
he
entered
the
little
amphitheatre
in
the
valley
of
the
giants
and
paused
with
an
expression
of
dismay
one
of
the
giants
had
fallen
and
lay
stretched
across
the
little
clearing
in
its
descent
it
had
demolished
the
little
white
stone
over
his
mother
grave
and
had
driven
the
fragments
of
the
stone
deep
into
the
earth
the
tremendous
brown
butt
quite
ruined
the
appearance
of
the
amphitheatre
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
constituted
a
barrier
some
fifteen
feet
high
and
of
equal
thickness
athwart
the
centre
of
the
clearing
with
fully
three
quarters
of
the
length
of
the
tree
lost
to
sight
where
the
fallen
monarch
had
wedged
between
its
more
fortunate
fellows
the
fact
that
the
tree
was
down
however
was
secondary
to
the
fact
that
neither
wind
nor
lightning
had
brought
it
low
but
rather
the
impious
hand
of
man
for
the
great
jagged
stump
showed
all
too
plainly
the
marks
of
saw
and
axe
a
pile
of
chips
four
feet
deep
littered
the
ground
for
fully
a
minute
bryce
stood
dumbly
gazing
upon
the
sacrilege
before
his
rage
and
horror
found
vent
in
words
an
enemy
has
done
this
thing
he
cried
aloud
to
the
and
over
her
grave
presently
smothering
his
emotion
he
walked
the
length
of
the
dead
giant
and
where
the
top
tapered
off
to
a
size
that
would
permit
of
his
stepping
across
it
he
retraced
his
steps
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
until
he
had
reached
a
point
some
fifty
feet
from
the
butt
when
the
vandal
reason
for
felling
the
monster
became
apparent
it
was
a
burl
tree
at
the
point
where
bryce
paused
a
malignant
growth
had
developed
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
for
all
the
world
like
a
tremendous
wart
this
was
the
burl
so
prized
for
and
panelling
because
of
the
fact
that
the
twisted
wavy
grain
lends
to
the
wood
an
extraordinary
beauty
when
polished
bryee
noted
that
the
work
of
removing
this
excrescence
had
been
accomplished
very
neatly
with
a
saw
the
growth
perhaps
ten
feet
in
diameter
had
been
neatly
sliced
off
much
as
a
housewife
cuts
slice
after
slice
from
a
loaf
of
bread
he
guessed
that
these
slices
practically
circular
in
shape
had
been
rolled
out
of
the
woods
to
some
conveyance
waiting
to
receive
them
what
bryce
could
not
understand
however
was
the
stupid
brutality
of
the
raiders
in
felling
the
tree
merely
for
that
section
of
burl
by
permitting
the
tree
to
stand
and
merely
building
a
staging
up
to
the
burl
the
latter
could
have
been
removed
without
vital
injury
to
the
tree
whereas
by
destroying
the
tree
the
wretches
had
evidenced
all
too
clearly
to
bryce
a
wanton
desire
to
add
insult
to
injury
bryce
inspected
the
scars
on
the
stump
carefully
they
were
to
such
an
extent
that
to
his
experienced
eye
it
was
evident
the
outrage
had
been
committed
more
than
a
year
previously
and
the
winter
rains
not
to
mention
the
spring
growth
of
grasses
and
underbrush
had
effectually
destroyed
all
trace
of
the
trail
taken
by
the
vandals
with
their
booty
poor
old
dad
he
murmured
i
glad
now
he
has
been
unable
to
get
up
here
and
see
this
it
would
have
broken
his
heart
i
have
this
tree
made
into
and
the
stump
dynamited
and
removed
this
summer
after
he
is
operated
on
and
gets
back
his
sight
he
will
come
up
here
and
he
must
never
know
perhaps
he
will
have
forgotten
how
many
trees
stood
in
this
circle
and
i
fill
in
the
hole
left
by
the
stump
and
plant
some
manzanita
there
to
hide
the
he
paused
peeping
out
from
under
a
chip
among
the
litter
at
his
feet
was
the
moldy
corner
of
a
white
envelope
in
an
instant
bryce
had
it
in
his
hand
the
envelope
was
dirty
and
but
to
a
certain
extent
the
redwood
chips
under
which
it
had
lain
hidden
had
served
to
protect
it
and
the
writing
on
the
face
was
still
legible
the
envelope
was
empty
and
addressed
to
jules
rondeau
care
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
sequoia
california
bryce
read
and
reread
that
address
rondeau
he
muttered
jules
rondeau
i
heard
that
name
before
ah
yes
dad
spoke
of
him
last
night
he
pennington
he
paused
an
enemy
had
done
this
thing
and
in
all
the
world
john
cardigan
had
but
one
enemy
colonel
seth
pennington
had
pennington
sent
his
to
do
this
dirty
work
out
of
sheer
spite
hardly
the
section
of
burl
was
gone
and
this
argued
that
the
question
of
spite
had
been
purely
a
matter
of
secondary
consideration
evidently
bryce
reasoned
someone
had
desired
that
burl
redwood
greatly
and
that
someone
had
not
been
jules
rondeau
since
a
would
not
be
likely
to
spend
five
minutes
of
his
leisure
time
in
consideration
of
the
beauties
of
a
burl
or
panel
hence
if
rondeau
had
superintended
the
task
of
felling
the
tree
it
must
have
been
at
the
behest
of
a
superior
and
since
a
acknowledges
no
superior
save
the
creator
of
the
the
recipient
of
that
stolen
burl
must
have
been
colonel
pennington
suddenly
he
thrilled
if
jules
rondeau
had
stolen
that
burl
to
present
it
to
colonel
pennington
his
employer
then
the
finished
article
must
be
in
pennington
home
and
bryce
had
been
invited
to
that
home
for
dinner
the
following
thursday
by
the
colonel
niece
i
go
after
all
he
told
himself
i
go
and
i
see
what
i
shall
he
was
too
wrought
up
now
to
sit
calmly
down
in
the
peace
and
quietude
of
the
giants
and
digest
the
annual
reports
sinclair
had
given
him
he
hastened
back
to
the
and
sought
sinclair
at
what
hour
does
the
leave
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
yard
for
our
in
township
nine
he
demanded
eight
and
one
daily
have
you
any
maps
of
the
holdings
of
pennington
and
ourselves
in
that
district
let
me
have
them
please
i
know
the
topography
of
that
district
perfectly
but
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
holdings
in
and
around
sinclair
gave
him
the
maps
and
bryce
retired
to
his
father
private
office
and
gave
himself
up
to
a
study
of
them
chapter
xi
when
shirley
sumner
descended
to
the
breakfast
room
on
the
morning
following
her
arrival
in
sequoia
the
first
glance
at
her
stately
countenance
informed
her
that
during
the
night
something
had
occurred
to
irritate
colonel
seth
pennington
and
startle
him
out
of
his
customary
bland
composure
he
greeted
her
politely
but
coldly
and
without
even
the
perfunctory
formality
of
inquiring
how
she
had
passed
the
night
he
came
directly
to
the
issue
shirley
he
began
did
i
hear
you
calling
young
cardigan
on
the
telephone
after
dinner
last
night
or
did
my
ears
deceive
me
your
ears
are
all
right
uncle
seth
i
called
cardigan
up
to
thank
him
for
the
pie
he
sent
over
and
incidentally
to
invite
him
over
here
to
dinner
on
thursday
i
thought
i
heard
you
asking
somebody
to
dinner
and
as
you
do
know
a
soul
in
sequoia
except
young
cardigan
naturally
i
opined
that
he
was
to
be
the
object
of
our
the
colonel
coughed
slightly
from
the
manner
in
which
he
approached
the
task
of
buttering
his
hot
cakes
shirley
knew
he
had
something
more
to
say
and
was
merely
formulating
a
polite
set
of
phrases
in
which
to
express
himself
she
resolved
to
help
him
along
i
dare
say
it
quite
all
right
to
have
invited
him
is
it
uncle
seth
certainly
certainly
my
dear
quite
all
right
but
er
ah
slightly
oh
i
so
sorry
if
i
had
known
perhaps
some
other
night
i
am
expecting
other
company
thursday
night
unfortunately
brayton
the
president
of
the
bank
of
sequoia
is
coming
up
to
dine
and
discuss
some
business
affairs
with
me
afterward
so
if
you
do
mind
my
dear
suppose
you
call
young
cardigan
up
and
ask
him
to
defer
his
visit
until
some
later
certainly
uncle
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
i
should
have
cardigan
on
thursday
if
his
presence
would
mean
the
slightest
interference
with
your
plans
what
perfectly
marvellous
roses
how
did
you
succeed
in
growing
them
uncle
seth
he
smiled
sourly
i
did
raise
them
he
replied
that
indian
that
drives
john
cardigan
car
brought
them
around
about
an
hour
ago
along
with
a
card
there
it
is
beside
your
she
blushed
ever
so
slightly
i
suppose
bryce
cardigan
is
vindicating
himself
she
murmured
as
she
withdrew
the
card
from
the
envelope
as
she
had
surmised
it
was
bryce
cardigan
colonel
pennington
was
the
proprietor
of
a
similar
surmise
fast
work
shirley
he
murmured
banteringly
i
wonder
what
he
send
you
for
luncheon
some
dill
pickles
she
pretended
to
be
very
busy
with
the
roses
and
not
to
have
heard
him
her
uncle
sneer
was
not
lost
on
her
however
she
resented
it
but
chose
to
ignore
it
for
the
present
and
when
at
length
she
had
finished
arranging
the
flowers
she
changed
the
conversation
adroitly
by
questioning
her
relative
anent
the
opportunities
for
shopping
in
sequoia
the
colonel
who
could
assimilate
a
hint
quicker
than
most
ordinary
mortals
saw
that
he
had
annoyed
her
and
he
promptly
hastened
to
make
amends
by
permitting
himself
to
be
led
readily
into
this
new
conversational
channel
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
however
he
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
urgent
business
at
the
office
and
left
the
room
shirley
left
alone
at
the
picked
idly
at
the
preserved
figs
the
owlish
butler
set
before
her
vaguely
she
wondered
at
her
uncle
apparent
hostility
to
the
cardigans
she
was
as
vaguely
troubled
in
the
knowledge
that
until
she
should
succeed
in
eradicating
this
hostility
it
must
inevitably
act
as
a
bar
to
the
further
progress
of
her
friendship
with
bryce
cardigan
and
she
told
herself
she
did
not
want
to
lose
that
friendship
she
was
the
least
bit
in
love
with
him
albeit
she
realized
he
was
rather
lovable
the
delight
which
she
had
experienced
in
his
society
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
absolutely
different
from
any
other
man
she
had
met
his
simplicity
his
utter
lack
of
swank
his
directness
his
good
nature
and
dry
sense
of
humour
made
him
shine
luminously
in
comparison
with
the
worldly
rather
artificial
young
men
she
had
previously
met
young
men
who
said
and
did
only
those
things
which
time
tradition
and
hallowed
memory
assured
them
were
done
by
the
right
sort
of
people
shirley
had
a
suspicion
that
bryce
cardigan
could
and
would
swear
like
a
pirate
should
his
temper
be
aroused
and
the
circumstances
appear
to
warrant
letting
off
steam
also
she
liked
him
because
he
was
imaginative
because
he
saw
and
sensed
and
properly
understood
without
a
diagram
or
a
blueprint
and
lastly
he
was
a
good
devoted
son
and
was
susceptible
of
development
into
a
congenial
and
wholly
acceptable
comrade
to
a
young
lady
absolutely
lacking
in
other
means
of
amusement
she
finished
her
breakfast
in
thoughtful
silence
then
she
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
bryce
at
his
home
tully
all
aflutter
with
curiosity
was
quite
insistent
that
shirley
should
leave
her
name
and
telephone
number
but
failing
to
carry
her
point
consented
to
inform
the
latter
that
bryce
was
at
the
office
she
gave
shirley
the
telephone
number
when
the
girl
called
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
bryce
answered
he
recognized
her
voice
instantly
and
called
her
name
before
she
had
opportunity
to
announce
her
identity
thank
you
so
much
for
the
beautiful
roses
cardigan
she
began
i
glad
you
liked
them
nobody
picks
flowers
out
of
our
garden
you
know
i
used
to
but
i
be
too
busy
hereafter
to
bother
with
the
very
well
then
i
am
not
to
expect
any
more
roses
i
a
stupid
clodhopper
of
course
you
may
by
the
way
miss
sumner
does
your
uncle
own
a
car
i
believe
he
does
a
little
old
rattletrap
which
he
drives
then
i
send
george
over
with
the
napier
this
afternoon
you
might
care
to
take
a
spin
out
into
the
surrounding
country
by
the
way
miss
sumner
you
are
to
consider
george
and
that
car
as
your
personal
property
i
fear
you
going
to
find
sequoia
a
dull
place
so
whenever
you
wish
to
go
for
a
ride
just
call
me
up
and
i
have
george
report
to
but
think
of
all
the
expensive
gasoline
and
tires
oh
but
you
must
look
at
things
from
that
angle
after
you
cross
the
rocky
mountains
on
your
way
west
moreover
mine
is
the
only
real
car
in
the
country
and
i
know
you
like
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
afternoon
i
do
know
i
have
thought
that
far
for
some
real
sport
i
would
suggest
that
you
motor
up
to
laguna
grande
that
spanish
for
big
lagoon
you
know
take
a
rod
with
you
there
are
some
salmon
in
the
lagoon
that
is
there
used
to
be
and
if
you
hook
one
you
get
a
but
i
have
any
i
send
you
over
a
good
but
i
have
nobody
to
teach
me
how
to
use
it
she
hinted
daringly
i
appreciate
that
compliment
he
flashed
back
at
her
but
unfortunately
my
holidays
are
over
for
a
long
long
time
i
took
my
father
place
in
the
business
this
so
soon
yes
things
have
been
happening
while
i
was
away
however
speaking
of
fishing
george
sea
otter
will
prove
an
invaluable
instructor
he
is
a
good
boy
and
you
may
trust
him
implicitly
on
thursday
evening
you
can
tell
me
what
success
you
had
with
the
oh
that
reminds
me
cardigan
you
ca
come
thursday
evening
after
and
she
explained
the
reason
by
jove
he
replied
i
mighty
glad
you
tipped
me
off
about
that
i
could
possibly
remain
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
a
one
who
will
not
lend
me
suppose
you
come
wednesday
night
we
call
that
a
bet
thank
she
chuckled
at
his
frank
good
humour
thank
you
mr
cardigan
for
all
your
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
and
if
you
will
persist
in
being
nice
to
me
you
might
send
george
sea
otter
and
the
car
at
be
glad
to
avail
myself
of
both
until
i
can
get
a
car
of
my
own
sent
up
from
san
francisco
till
wednesday
night
then
as
bryce
cardigan
hung
up
he
heaved
a
slight
sigh
and
a
parody
on
a
quatrain
from
lalla
rookh
ran
through
his
mind
i
never
loved
a
dear
gazelle
to
glad
me
with
its
limpid
eye
but
when
i
learned
to
love
it
well
the
thing
was
sure
to
die
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
of
the
habit
of
playing
he
found
himself
the
possessor
of
a
very
great
desire
to
close
down
the
desk
call
on
shirley
sumner
and
spend
the
remainder
of
the
day
basking
in
the
sunlight
of
her
presence
chapter
xii
the
days
passed
swiftly
as
they
have
a
habit
of
passing
after
one
has
discovered
one
allotted
task
in
life
and
has
proceeded
to
perform
it
following
his
discovery
of
the
outrage
committed
on
his
sanctuary
bryce
wasted
considerable
valuable
time
and
effort
in
a
futile
endeavour
to
gather
some
further
hint
of
the
identity
of
the
vandals
but
despairing
at
last
he
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
resolving
only
that
on
thursday
he
would
go
up
into
pennington
woods
and
interview
the
redoubtable
jules
rondeau
bryce
natural
inclination
was
to
wait
upon
rondeau
immediately
if
not
sooner
but
the
recollection
of
his
dinner
engagement
at
the
pennington
home
warned
him
to
proceed
cautiously
for
while
harbouring
no
apprehensions
as
to
the
outcome
of
a
possible
clash
with
rondeau
bryce
was
not
so
optimistic
as
to
believe
he
would
escape
unscathed
from
an
encounter
experience
had
impressed
upon
him
the
fact
that
in
a
battle
nobody
is
quite
so
thoroughly
at
home
as
a
lumberjack
once
in
a
clinch
with
such
a
man
even
a
champion
gladiator
of
the
prize
ring
may
well
feel
apprehensive
of
the
outcome
wednesday
evening
at
five
sinclair
the
manager
came
into
bryce
office
with
a
handful
of
folded
papers
i
have
here
he
announced
in
his
clerky
voice
with
a
touch
of
solemnity
to
it
a
trial
balance
i
have
not
had
time
to
make
an
exact
inventory
but
in
order
to
give
you
some
idea
of
the
condition
of
your
father
affairs
i
have
used
approximate
figures
and
prepared
a
bryce
reached
for
the
papers
you
will
note
the
amount
charged
off
to
profit
and
loss
under
the
head
of
sinclair
continued
it
amounts
approximately
to
two
thousand
dollars
a
month
and
this
sum
represents
payments
to
crippled
employees
and
the
dependent
families
of
men
killed
in
the
employ
of
the
in
addition
to
these
payments
your
father
owns
farms
which
he
has
cleared
from
his
lands
these
little
farms
are
equipped
with
bungalows
and
outbuildings
built
by
your
father
and
represent
a
considerable
investment
as
you
know
these
farms
are
wonderfully
rich
and
are
planted
in
apples
and
berries
other
lands
contiguous
to
them
sell
readily
at
two
hundred
dollars
an
acre
and
so
you
will
see
that
your
father
has
approximately
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
tied
up
in
these
little
but
he
has
given
a
at
nothing
a
year
for
each
farm
to
former
employees
who
have
been
smashed
beyond
the
possibility
of
doing
the
hard
work
of
the
mill
and
woods
bryce
reminded
the
manager
hence
you
must
not
figure
those
farms
among
our
why
not
sinclair
replied
evenly
formal
leases
have
never
been
executed
and
the
tenants
occupy
the
property
at
your
i
think
that
will
be
about
as
far
as
the
discussion
on
that
point
need
proceed
bryce
replied
smilingly
my
father
word
has
always
been
considered
sufficient
in
this
country
his
verbal
promise
to
pay
has
always
been
collateral
enough
for
those
who
know
but
my
dear
boy
sinclair
protested
while
that
sort
of
philanthropy
is
very
delightful
when
one
can
afford
the
luxury
it
is
scarcely
practical
when
one
is
teetering
on
the
verge
of
financial
ruin
after
all
bryce
is
the
first
law
of
human
nature
and
the
sale
of
those
farms
would
go
a
long
way
toward
helping
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
out
of
the
hole
it
is
in
at
and
we
really
teetering
on
the
edge
of
financial
ruin
eh
bryce
queried
calmly
that
is
expressing
your
condition
mildly
the
payment
of
interest
on
the
bonded
indebtedness
falls
due
on
july
first
and
going
to
default
on
it
sure
as
death
and
taxes
colonel
pennington
holds
a
majority
of
our
bonds
and
that
means
prompt
suit
for
well
then
sinclair
bryce
retorted
carefully
the
documents
the
manager
had
handed
him
i
tell
you
what
we
do
for
fifty
years
my
father
has
played
the
game
in
this
community
like
a
sport
and
a
gentleman
and
i
be
damned
if
his
son
will
dog
it
now
at
the
finish
i
gather
from
your
remarks
that
we
could
find
ready
sale
for
those
little
farms
i
am
continually
receiving
offers
for
then
they
were
not
included
in
the
list
of
properties
covered
by
our
bonded
indebtedness
no
your
father
refused
to
include
them
he
said
he
would
take
a
chance
on
the
financial
future
of
himself
and
his
boy
but
not
on
his
helpless
good
old
john
cardigan
well
sinclair
i
not
take
a
chance
on
them
either
so
morning
you
will
instruct
our
attorney
to
draw
up
formal
on
those
farms
and
to
make
certain
they
are
absolutely
unassailable
colonel
pennington
may
have
the
lands
sold
to
satisfy
a
deficiency
judgment
against
us
but
while
those
from
the
former
owner
are
in
force
my
father
proteges
can
not
be
dispossessed
after
they
are
dead
of
course
pennington
may
take
the
farms
and
be
damned
to
sinclair
stared
in
frank
amazement
at
his
youthful
superior
you
are
throwing
away
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
he
said
distinctly
i
have
thrown
it
away
yet
you
forget
sinclair
that
we
going
to
fight
first
and
fight
like
fiends
then
if
we
lose
well
the
tail
goes
with
the
hide
by
the
way
sinclair
are
any
of
those
farms
untenanted
at
the
present
time
yes
old
bill
tarpey
who
lost
his
three
boys
in
a
forest
fire
over
on
the
san
hedrin
passed
out
last
week
the
tarpey
boys
died
in
the
cardigan
employ
and
so
your
father
gave
bill
the
use
of
a
farm
out
near
well
you
better
be
his
successor
sinclair
you
no
longer
a
young
man
and
you
been
thirty
years
in
this
office
play
safe
sinclair
and
include
yourself
in
one
of
those
my
dear
boy
nonsense
united
we
stand
divided
we
fall
sinclair
and
let
there
be
no
moaning
of
the
bar
when
a
cardigan
puts
out
to
smiling
he
rose
from
his
desk
patted
the
bewildered
sinclair
on
the
latter
grizzled
head
and
then
reached
for
his
hat
i
dining
out
sinclair
and
i
would
be
a
at
the
feast
for
a
ripe
peach
your
confounded
figures
might
make
me
gloomy
so
we
just
reserve
discussion
of
them
till
morning
be
a
sport
sinclair
and
for
once
in
your
life
beat
the
six
whistle
in
other
words
i
suggest
that
you
go
home
and
rest
for
he
left
sinclair
staring
at
him
rather
stupidly
chapter
xiii
colonel
pennington
imported
british
butler
showed
bryce
into
the
pennington
living
room
at
announcing
him
with
due
ceremony
shirley
rose
from
the
piano
where
she
had
been
idly
fingering
the
keys
and
greeted
him
with
every
appearance
of
pleasure
following
which
she
turned
to
present
her
visitor
to
colonel
pennington
who
was
standing
in
his
favourite
position
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
uncle
seth
this
is
cardigan
who
was
so
very
nice
to
me
the
day
i
landed
in
red
the
colonel
bowed
i
have
to
thank
you
sir
for
your
courtesy
to
my
he
had
assumed
an
air
of
reserve
of
distinct
aloofness
despite
his
studied
politeness
bryce
stepped
forward
with
extended
hand
which
the
colonel
grasped
in
a
manner
vaguely
suggestive
of
that
creation
of
charles
dickens
uriah
heep
bryce
was
tempted
to
squeeze
the
lax
fingers
until
the
colonel
should
bellow
with
pain
but
resisting
the
ungenerous
impulse
he
replied
instead
your
niece
colonel
is
one
of
those
fortunate
beings
the
world
will
always
clamour
to
quite
true
cardigan
when
she
was
quite
a
little
girl
i
came
under
her
spell
so
did
i
colonel
miss
sumner
has
doubtless
told
you
of
our
first
meeting
some
twelve
years
ago
quite
so
may
i
offer
you
a
cocktail
cardigan
thank
you
certainly
dad
and
i
have
been
pinning
one
on
about
this
time
every
night
since
my
shirley
belongs
to
the
band
of
hope
the
colonel
explained
ready
at
any
time
to
break
a
lance
with
the
demon
rum
back
in
michigan
where
we
used
to
live
she
saw
too
many
woodsmen
around
after
the
spring
drive
so
we
have
to
drink
her
share
cardigan
pray
be
bryce
seated
himself
well
we
lumbermen
are
a
low
lot
and
naturally
fond
of
dissipation
he
agreed
i
fear
miss
sumner
prohibition
tendencies
will
be
still
further
strengthened
after
she
has
seen
the
what
is
that
shirley
queried
the
runs
over
your
uncle
logging
railroad
up
into
township
nine
where
his
timber
and
ours
is
located
it
is
the
only
train
operated
on
sunday
and
it
leaves
sequoia
at
five
to
carry
the
pennington
and
cardigan
crews
back
to
the
woods
after
their
celebration
in
town
as
a
usual
thing
all
hands
with
the
exception
of
the
brakeman
engineers
and
fireman
are
singing
weeping
or
fighting
but
why
do
you
provide
transportation
for
them
to
come
to
town
saturday
nights
shirley
protested
they
ride
in
on
the
last
trainload
of
logs
and
if
we
did
let
them
do
it
they
ask
for
their
time
it
the
way
of
the
gentle
lumberjack
and
of
course
once
they
get
in
we
have
to
round
them
up
on
sunday
afternoon
and
get
them
back
on
the
job
hence
the
do
they
fight
cardigan
frequently
i
might
say
usually
it
quite
an
inspiring
sight
to
see
a
couple
of
lumberjacks
going
to
it
on
a
travelling
thirty
miles
an
but
are
they
liable
to
fall
off
and
get
killed
no
you
see
they
used
to
fighting
that
way
moreover
the
engineer
looks
back
and
if
he
sees
any
signs
of
donnybrook
fair
he
slows
how
horrible
yes
indeed
the
right
of
way
is
lined
with
empty
whiskey
colonel
pennington
spoke
up
we
do
have
any
fighting
on
the
any
more
he
said
blandly
indeed
how
do
you
prevent
it
bryce
asked
my
jules
rondeau
makes
them
keep
the
peace
pennington
replied
with
a
small
smile
if
there
any
fighting
to
be
done
he
does
you
mean
among
his
own
crew
of
course
bryce
suggested
no
he
in
charge
of
the
and
whether
a
fight
starts
among
your
men
or
ours
he
takes
a
hand
he
had
them
all
behaving
mildly
for
quite
a
while
because
he
can
whip
any
man
in
the
country
and
everybody
realizes
it
i
do
know
what
i
do
without
rondeau
he
certainly
makes
those
bohunks
of
mine
step
do
you
employ
bohunks
colonel
certainly
they
cost
less
they
are
far
less
independent
than
most
men
and
more
readily
handled
and
you
do
have
to
pamper
them
particularly
in
the
matter
of
food
why
mr
cardigan
with
all
due
respect
to
your
father
the
way
he
feeds
his
men
is
simply
ridiculous
cake
and
pie
and
doughnuts
at
the
same
meal
the
colonel
snorted
virtuously
well
dad
started
in
to
feed
his
men
the
same
food
he
fed
himself
and
i
suppose
the
habits
one
forms
in
youth
are
not
readily
changed
in
old
age
but
that
makes
it
hard
for
other
manufacturers
the
colonel
protested
i
feed
my
men
good
plain
food
and
plenty
of
it
quite
better
food
than
they
were
used
to
before
they
came
to
this
country
but
i
can
not
seem
to
satisfy
them
i
am
continuously
being
reminded
when
i
do
a
thing
thus
and
so
that
john
cardigan
does
it
otherwise
your
respected
parent
is
the
basis
for
comparison
in
this
country
cardigan
and
i
find
it
devilish
he
laughed
indulgently
and
passed
his
to
bryce
uncle
seth
always
grows
restless
when
some
other
man
is
the
leader
shirley
volunteered
with
a
mischievous
glance
at
pennington
he
was
the
great
of
the
back
in
michigan
but
out
here
he
has
to
play
second
fiddle
do
you
i
afraid
i
do
my
dear
the
colonel
admitted
with
his
best
air
of
hearty
expansiveness
i
afraid
i
do
however
cardigan
now
that
you
have
at
least
i
have
been
so
informed
taken
over
your
business
i
am
hoping
we
will
be
enabled
to
get
together
on
many
little
details
and
work
them
out
on
a
common
basis
to
our
mutual
advantage
we
lumbermen
should
stand
together
and
not
make
it
hard
for
each
other
for
instance
your
scale
of
wages
is
totally
disproportionate
to
the
present
high
cost
of
manufacture
and
the
mediocre
market
yet
just
because
you
pay
it
you
set
a
precedent
which
we
are
all
forced
to
follow
however
he
concluded
let
not
talk
shop
i
imagine
we
have
enough
of
that
during
the
day
besides
here
are
the
with
the
disposal
of
the
cocktails
the
conversation
drifted
into
a
discussion
of
shirley
adventures
with
a
salmon
in
big
lagoon
the
colonel
discoursed
learnedly
on
the
superior
sport
of
which
prompted
bryce
to
enter
into
a
description
of
going
after
swordfish
among
the
islands
of
the
santa
barbara
channel
when
the
fish
gets
into
white
water
is
good
sport
is
fine
and
the
in
eel
river
are
hard
to
beat
muskellunge
are
a
delight
and
tarpon
are
not
so
bad
if
looking
for
thrills
but
for
genuine
inspiration
give
me
a
swordfish
that
will
leap
out
of
the
water
from
three
to
six
feet
and
do
it
three
or
four
hundred
times
all
on
a
line
and
rod
so
light
one
dares
not
state
the
exact
weight
if
he
values
his
reputation
for
veracity
once
i
was
fishing
at
san
the
butler
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
bowed
to
shirley
at
the
time
announcing
that
dinner
was
served
the
girl
rose
and
gave
her
arm
to
bryce
with
her
other
arm
linked
through
her
uncle
she
turned
toward
the
dining
room
just
inside
the
entrance
bryce
paused
the
soft
glow
of
the
candles
in
the
silver
candlesticks
upon
the
table
was
reflected
in
the
polished
walls
of
the
formed
of
panels
of
the
most
exquisitely
patterned
redwood
burl
bryce
cardigan
had
ever
seen
also
the
panels
were
unusually
large
shirley
sumner
alert
glance
followed
bryce
as
it
swept
around
the
room
this
dining
room
is
uncle
seth
particular
delight
cardigan
she
explained
it
is
very
beautiful
miss
sumner
and
your
uncle
has
worked
wonders
in
the
matter
of
having
it
polished
those
panels
are
positively
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
specimens
of
redwood
burl
ever
turned
out
in
this
country
the
grain
is
not
merely
wavy
it
is
not
merely
curly
it
is
actually
so
contrary
that
you
have
here
colonel
pennington
a
room
absolutely
unique
in
that
it
is
formed
of
burl
mark
the
deep
shadows
in
it
and
how
it
does
reflect
those
candles
it
is
beautiful
the
colonel
declared
and
i
must
confess
to
a
pardonable
pride
in
it
although
the
task
of
keeping
these
walls
from
being
marred
by
the
furniture
knocking
against
them
requires
the
utmost
bryce
turned
and
his
brown
eyes
blazed
into
the
colonel
where
did
you
succeed
in
finding
such
a
marvellous
tree
he
queried
pointedly
i
know
of
but
one
tree
in
humboldt
county
that
could
have
produced
such
beautiful
for
about
a
second
colonel
pennington
met
bryce
glance
unwaveringly
then
he
read
something
in
his
guest
eyes
and
his
glance
shifted
while
over
his
benign
countenance
a
flush
spread
quickly
bryce
noted
it
and
his
quickly
roused
suspicions
were
as
quickly
kindled
into
certainty
where
did
you
find
that
tree
he
repeated
innocently
rondeau
my
knew
i
was
on
the
lookout
for
something
special
something
nobody
else
could
get
so
he
kept
his
eyes
indeed
there
was
just
a
trace
of
irony
in
bryce
tones
as
he
drew
shirley
chair
and
held
it
for
her
as
you
say
colonel
it
is
difficult
to
keep
such
soft
wood
from
being
marred
by
contact
with
the
furniture
and
you
are
fortunate
to
have
such
a
in
your
employ
such
loyal
fellows
are
usually
too
good
to
be
true
and
quite
frequently
they
put
their
blankets
on
their
backs
and
get
out
of
the
country
when
you
least
expect
it
i
dare
say
it
would
be
a
shock
to
you
if
rondeau
did
there
was
no
mistaking
the
veiled
threat
behind
that
apparently
innocent
observation
and
the
colonel
being
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
astuteness
realized
that
at
last
he
must
place
his
cards
on
the
table
his
glance
as
he
rested
it
on
bryce
now
was
baleful
ophidian
yes
he
said
i
would
be
rather
disappointed
however
i
pay
rondeau
rather
more
than
it
is
customary
to
pay
so
i
imagine
stay
unless
of
course
somebody
takes
a
notion
to
run
him
out
of
the
county
and
when
that
happens
i
want
to
be
on
hand
to
view
the
bryce
sprinkled
a
modicum
of
salt
in
his
soup
i
going
up
into
township
nine
afternoon
he
remarked
casually
i
think
i
shall
go
over
to
your
camp
and
pay
the
incomparable
jules
a
brief
visit
really
i
have
heard
so
much
about
that
of
yours
colonel
that
i
ache
to
take
him
apart
and
see
what
makes
him
again
the
colonel
assimilated
the
hint
but
preferred
to
dissemble
oh
you
ca
steal
him
from
me
cardigan
he
laughed
i
warn
you
in
advance
so
spare
yourself
the
i
try
anything
once
bryce
retorted
with
equal
good
nature
however
i
do
want
to
steal
him
from
you
i
want
to
ascertain
from
him
where
he
procured
this
burl
there
may
be
more
of
the
same
in
the
neighbourhood
where
he
got
he
would
tell
he
might
i
a
persuasive
little
cuss
when
i
choose
to
exert
rondeau
is
not
communicative
he
requires
lots
of
what
delicious
soup
bryce
murmured
blandly
miss
sumner
may
i
have
a
cracker
the
dinner
passed
pleasantly
the
challenge
and
defiance
between
guest
and
host
had
been
so
skillfully
and
gracefully
exchanged
that
shirley
had
the
slightest
suspicion
that
these
two
men
had
under
her
very
nose
as
it
were
agreed
to
be
enemies
and
then
for
the
time
being
turned
their
attention
to
other
and
more
trifling
matters
coffee
was
served
in
the
living
room
and
through
the
fragrant
smoke
of
pennington
perfectos
a
sprightly
conversation
continued
for
an
hour
then
the
colonel
secretly
enraged
at
the
calm
mocking
contemplative
glances
which
bryce
ever
and
anon
bestowed
upon
him
and
unable
longer
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
too
apprehensive
that
this
cool
young
man
knew
nothing
and
would
do
nothing
even
if
he
knew
something
rose
pleaded
the
necessity
for
looking
over
some
papers
and
bade
bryce
foolishly
he
proffered
bryce
a
limp
hand
and
a
demon
of
deviltry
taking
possession
of
the
latter
this
time
he
squeezed
with
a
simple
hearty
earnestness
the
while
he
said
colonel
pennington
i
hope
i
do
not
have
to
assure
you
that
my
visit
here
this
evening
has
not
only
been
delightful
but
er
instructive
sir
and
pleasant
with
difficulty
the
colonel
suppressed
a
groan
however
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
who
suffers
in
silence
for
a
minute
later
the
butler
leaning
over
the
banisters
as
his
master
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
library
heard
the
latter
curse
with
an
eloquence
that
was
singularly
appealing
chapter
xiv
colonel
seth
pennington
looked
up
sourly
as
a
clerk
entered
his
private
office
well
he
demanded
brusquely
when
addressing
his
employees
the
colonel
seldom
bothered
to
assume
his
pontifical
manner
mr
bryce
cardigan
is
waiting
to
see
you
very
well
show
him
bryce
entered
good
morning
colonel
he
said
pleasantly
and
brazenly
thrust
out
his
hand
not
for
me
my
boy
the
colonel
assured
him
i
had
enough
of
that
last
night
we
just
consider
the
all
attended
to
if
you
please
have
a
chair
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
i
can
do
to
make
you
i
delighted
to
find
you
in
such
a
generous
frame
of
mind
colonel
you
can
make
me
genuinely
happy
by
renewing
for
ten
years
on
the
same
terms
as
the
original
contract
your
arrangement
to
freight
the
logs
of
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
from
the
woods
to
colonel
pennington
cleared
his
throat
with
a
propitiatory
then
he
removed
his
gold
spectacles
and
carefully
wiped
them
with
a
silk
handkerchief
as
carefully
replaced
them
upon
his
aristocratic
nose
and
then
gazed
curiously
at
bryce
upon
my
soul
he
breathed
i
realized
of
course
that
this
is
reopening
an
issue
which
you
have
been
pleased
to
regard
as
having
been
settled
in
the
last
letter
my
father
had
from
you
and
wherein
you
named
terms
that
were
absolutely
my
dear
young
friend
my
very
dear
young
friend
i
must
protest
at
being
asked
to
discuss
this
matter
your
father
and
i
have
been
over
it
in
detail
we
failed
to
agree
and
that
settles
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
not
in
position
to
handle
your
logs
with
my
limited
and
that
old
hauling
contract
which
i
took
over
when
i
bought
the
mills
and
logging
railroad
from
the
late
henderson
and
incorporated
into
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
has
been
an
embarrassment
i
have
longed
to
rid
myself
of
under
those
circumstances
you
could
scarcely
expect
me
to
saddle
myself
with
it
again
at
your
mere
request
and
solely
to
oblige
i
did
not
expect
you
to
agree
to
my
request
i
am
not
quite
that
optimistic
bryce
replied
evenly
then
why
did
you
ask
me
i
thought
that
possibly
if
i
reopened
negotiations
you
might
have
a
reasonable
to
i
have
thought
of
i
suppose
if
i
agreed
to
sell
you
that
of
timber
in
the
little
valley
over
yonder
he
pointed
to
the
east
and
the
natural
outlet
for
your
squaw
creek
timber
you
quickly
think
of
one
bryce
suggested
pointedly
no
i
am
not
in
the
market
for
that
valley
of
the
giants
as
your
idealistic
father
prefers
to
call
it
once
i
would
have
purchased
it
for
double
its
value
but
at
present
i
am
not
nevertheless
it
would
be
an
advantage
for
you
to
possess
my
dear
boy
the
possession
of
that
big
timber
is
an
advantage
i
expect
to
enjoy
before
i
acquire
many
more
gray
hairs
but
i
do
not
expect
to
pay
for
do
you
expect
me
to
offer
it
to
you
as
a
bonus
for
renewing
our
hauling
contract
the
colonel
snapped
his
fingers
by
george
he
declared
that
a
bright
idea
and
a
few
months
ago
i
would
have
been
inclined
to
consider
it
very
seriously
but
now
you
figure
you
got
us
winging
eh
bryce
was
smiling
pleasantly
i
am
making
no
admissions
pennington
responded
enigmatically
nor
any
hauling
contracts
for
my
neighbour
logs
he
added
you
may
change
your
i
suppose
i
have
to
abandon
logging
in
township
nine
and
go
back
to
the
san
hedrin
bryce
sighed
resignedly
if
you
do
you
go
broke
you
ca
afford
it
you
on
the
verge
of
insolvency
this
i
suppose
since
you
decline
to
haul
our
logs
after
the
expiration
of
our
present
contract
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
are
not
financially
able
to
build
our
own
logging
railroad
that
the
wisest
course
my
father
and
i
could
pursue
would
be
to
sell
our
timber
in
township
nine
to
you
it
adjoins
your
holdings
in
the
same
township
i
had
a
notion
the
situation
would
begin
to
dawn
upon
the
colonel
was
smiling
now
his
handsome
face
was
gradually
assuming
the
expression
pontifical
i
give
you
a
dollar
a
thousand
feet
stumpage
for
on
whose
cruise
oh
my
own
cruisers
will
estimate
i
afraid
i
ca
accept
that
offer
we
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
it
you
know
and
if
we
sold
it
to
you
at
a
dollar
the
sale
would
not
bring
us
sufficient
money
to
take
up
our
bonded
indebtedness
we
only
have
the
san
hedrin
timber
and
the
valley
of
the
giants
left
and
since
we
can
not
log
either
of
these
at
present
naturally
we
be
out
of
that
the
way
i
figured
it
my
well
we
not
going
out
of
pardon
me
for
disagreeing
with
you
i
think
you
not
much
we
ca
afford
the
colonel
smiled
benignantly
my
dear
boy
my
very
dear
young
friend
listen
to
me
your
paternal
ancestor
is
the
only
human
being
who
has
ever
succeeded
in
making
a
perfect
monkey
of
me
when
i
wanted
to
purchase
from
him
a
right
of
way
through
his
absurd
valley
of
the
giants
in
order
that
i
might
log
my
squaw
creek
timber
he
refused
me
and
to
add
insult
to
injury
he
spouted
a
lot
of
rot
about
his
big
trees
how
much
they
meant
to
him
and
the
utter
artistic
horror
of
running
a
through
the
grove
particularly
since
he
planned
to
bequeath
it
to
sequoia
as
a
public
park
he
expects
the
city
to
grow
up
to
it
during
the
next
twenty
years
my
boy
that
was
the
first
bad
break
your
father
made
his
second
break
was
his
refusal
to
sell
me
a
he
was
the
first
man
in
this
county
and
he
had
been
shrewd
enough
to
hog
all
the
real
estate
and
hold
onto
it
i
remember
he
called
himself
a
progressive
citizen
and
when
i
asked
him
why
he
was
so
assiduously
blocking
the
wheels
of
progress
he
replied
that
the
railroad
would
build
in
from
the
south
some
day
but
that
when
it
did
its
builders
would
have
to
be
assured
of
terminal
facilities
on
humboldt
bay
holding
intact
the
spot
where
rail
and
water
are
bound
to
meet
he
told
me
insure
the
terminal
on
tidewater
which
the
railroad
must
have
before
consenting
to
build
but
if
i
sell
it
to
tom
dick
and
harry
they
will
be
certain
to
gouge
the
railroad
when
the
latter
tries
to
buy
it
from
them
they
may
scare
the
railroad
away
naturally
bryce
replied
the
average
human
being
is
a
hog
and
merciless
when
he
has
the
upper
hand
he
figures
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
my
father
on
the
contrary
has
always
planned
for
the
future
he
did
want
that
railroad
blocked
by
and
its
building
delayed
the
country
needed
rail
connection
with
the
outside
world
and
moreover
his
san
hedrin
timber
is
worth
a
hoot
until
that
feeder
to
a
transcontinental
road
shall
be
built
to
tap
but
he
sold
bill
henderson
the
on
tidewater
that
he
refused
to
sell
me
and
later
i
had
to
pay
henderson
heirs
a
whooping
price
for
it
and
i
have
half
the
land
i
but
he
needed
henderson
then
they
had
a
deal
on
together
you
must
remember
colonel
that
while
bill
henderson
held
that
squaw
creek
timber
he
later
sold
you
my
father
would
never
sell
him
a
ca
you
see
the
sporting
point
of
view
involved
my
father
and
bill
henderson
were
rivals
for
thirty
years
they
had
tried
to
outgame
each
other
on
that
squaw
creek
timber
henderson
thought
he
could
force
my
father
to
buy
at
a
certain
price
and
my
father
thought
he
could
force
henderson
to
sell
at
a
lesser
price
they
were
perfectly
frank
about
it
with
each
other
and
held
no
grudges
of
course
after
you
bought
henderson
out
you
foolishly
took
over
his
job
of
trying
to
outgame
my
father
that
why
you
bought
henderson
out
is
it
you
had
a
vision
of
my
father
paying
you
a
nice
profit
on
your
investment
but
he
fooled
you
and
now
you
peeved
and
wo
bryce
hitched
his
chair
farther
toward
the
colonel
why
should
my
dad
be
nice
to
bill
henderson
after
the
feud
ended
he
continued
they
could
play
the
game
together
then
and
they
did
colonel
why
ca
you
be
as
sporty
as
henderson
and
my
father
they
fought
each
other
but
they
fought
fairly
and
in
the
open
and
they
never
lost
the
respect
and
liking
each
had
for
the
i
will
not
renew
your
logging
contract
that
is
final
young
man
no
man
can
ride
me
with
spurs
and
get
away
with
oh
i
knew
that
then
why
have
you
called
on
me
taking
up
my
time
on
a
dead
issue
i
wanted
to
give
you
one
final
chance
to
repent
i
know
your
plan
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
smash
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
acquire
it
at
fifty
per
cent
of
its
value
and
merge
its
assets
with
your
laguna
grande
lumber
company
you
are
an
ambitious
man
you
want
to
be
the
greatest
redwood
manufacturer
in
california
and
in
order
to
achieve
your
ambitions
you
are
willing
to
ruin
a
competitor
you
decline
to
play
the
game
like
a
i
play
the
game
of
business
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
i
do
nothing
illegal
and
nothing
generous
or
chivalrous
colonel
you
know
your
plea
of
a
shortage
of
is
that
the
contract
for
hauling
our
logs
has
been
very
profitable
and
will
be
more
profitable
in
the
future
if
you
will
accept
a
increase
on
the
and
renew
the
contract
for
ten
nothing
doing
young
man
remember
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
ask
then
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
down
fighting
i
do
not
anticipate
much
of
a
you
get
as
much
as
i
can
give
i
not
at
all
and
i
begin
by
running
your
out
of
the
you
know
why
of
course
those
burl
panels
in
your
dining
room
rondeau
felled
a
tree
in
our
valley
of
the
giants
to
get
that
burl
for
you
colonel
pennington
flushed
i
defy
you
to
prove
that
he
almost
shouted
very
well
i
make
rondeau
confess
perhaps
he
even
tell
me
who
sent
him
after
the
burl
upon
my
word
i
think
you
inspired
that
dastardly
raid
at
any
rate
i
know
rondeau
is
guilty
and
you
as
his
employer
and
the
beneficiary
of
his
crime
must
accept
the
the
colonel
face
went
white
i
do
not
admit
anything
except
that
you
appear
to
have
lost
your
head
young
man
however
for
the
sake
of
argument
granting
that
rondeau
felled
that
tree
he
did
it
under
the
apprehension
that
your
valley
of
the
giants
is
a
part
of
my
squaw
creek
timber
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
malice
in
the
act
brutality
even
for
my
mother
grave
identified
the
land
as
ours
and
rondeau
felled
the
tree
on
her
if
that
is
so
and
rondeau
felled
that
tree
i
do
not
believe
he
did
i
am
sincerely
sorry
cardigan
name
your
price
and
i
will
pay
you
for
the
tree
i
do
not
desire
any
trouble
to
develop
over
this
you
ca
pay
for
that
tree
bryce
burst
forth
no
pitiful
human
being
can
pay
in
dollars
and
cents
for
the
wanton
destruction
of
handiwork
you
wanted
that
burl
and
when
my
father
was
blind
and
could
no
longer
make
his
sunday
pilgrimage
up
to
that
grove
your
went
up
and
stole
that
which
you
knew
you
could
not
that
will
be
about
all
from
you
young
man
get
out
of
my
office
and
by
the
way
forget
that
you
have
met
my
it
your
office
so
i
get
out
as
for
your
second
command
he
snapped
his
fingers
in
pennington
face
fooey
when
bryce
had
gone
the
colonel
hurriedly
called
his
on
the
telephone
and
asked
for
jules
rondeau
only
to
be
informed
by
the
timekeeper
who
answered
the
telephone
that
rondeau
was
up
in
the
green
timber
with
the
choppers
and
could
not
be
gotten
to
the
telephone
in
less
than
two
hours
do
not
send
for
him
then
pennington
commanded
i
coming
up
on
the
train
and
will
talk
to
him
when
he
comes
in
for
his
at
eleven
and
just
as
the
colonel
was
leaving
to
board
the
bound
empty
for
the
woods
shirley
sumner
made
her
appearance
in
his
office
uncle
seth
she
complained
i
lonesome
the
bookkeeper
tells
me
you
going
up
to
the
may
i
go
with
you
by
all
means
usually
i
ride
in
the
cab
with
the
engineer
and
fireman
but
if
you
coming
i
have
them
hook
on
the
caboose
step
lively
my
dear
or
they
be
holding
the
train
for
us
and
upsetting
our
chapter
xv
by
virtue
of
their
with
pennington
the
cardigans
and
their
employees
were
transported
free
over
pennington
logging
railroad
hence
when
bryce
cardigan
resolved
to
wait
upon
jules
rondeau
in
the
matter
of
that
murdered
giant
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
choose
the
shortest
and
most
direct
route
to
his
quarry
and
as
the
long
string
of
empty
came
crawling
off
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
he
swung
over
the
side
quite
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
shirley
and
her
precious
relative
were
riding
in
the
little
caboose
in
the
rear
at
the
train
slid
in
on
the
log
landing
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
main
camp
and
bryce
dropped
off
and
approached
the
engineer
of
the
little
used
for
loading
the
logs
where
rondeau
he
asked
the
engineer
pointed
to
a
huge
swarthy
man
approaching
across
the
clearing
in
which
the
camp
was
situated
that
him
he
replied
and
without
further
ado
bryce
strode
to
meet
his
man
are
you
jules
rondeau
he
demanded
as
he
came
up
to
the
the
latter
nodded
i
bryce
cardigan
his
interrogator
announced
and
i
here
to
thrash
you
for
chopping
that
big
redwood
tree
over
in
that
little
valley
where
my
mother
is
oh
rondeau
smiled
wiz
pleasure
and
without
a
hesitation
he
rushed
bryce
backed
away
from
him
warily
and
they
circled
when
i
get
through
with
you
rondeau
bryce
said
distinctly
take
a
good
man
to
lead
you
to
your
meals
this
country
is
big
enough
for
both
of
us
and
since
you
came
here
last
you
got
to
go
bryce
stepped
in
feinted
for
rondeau
jaw
with
his
right
and
when
the
quickly
covered
ripped
a
sizzling
left
into
the
midriff
rondeau
grunted
and
dropped
his
guard
with
the
result
that
bryce
great
fists
played
a
devil
tattoo
on
his
countenance
before
he
could
crouch
and
cover
this
is
a
tough
one
thought
bryce
his
blows
had
not
apparently
had
the
slightest
effect
on
the
crouched
low
and
with
his
arms
wrapped
around
his
head
rondeau
still
came
on
unfalteringly
and
bryce
was
forced
to
give
way
before
him
to
save
his
hands
he
avoided
the
risk
of
battering
rondeau
hard
head
and
sinewy
arms
already
word
that
the
was
battling
with
a
stranger
had
been
shouted
into
the
camp
dining
room
and
the
entire
crew
of
that
camp
abandoning
their
meal
came
pouring
forth
to
view
the
contest
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
bryce
saw
them
coming
but
he
was
not
apprehensive
for
he
knew
the
code
of
the
woodsman
let
every
man
roll
his
own
it
would
be
a
fight
to
a
finish
for
no
man
would
interfere
striking
kicking
gouging
biting
or
choking
would
not
be
looked
upon
as
unsportsmanlike
and
as
bryce
backed
cautiously
away
from
the
huge
lithe
active
and
powerful
man
before
him
he
realized
that
jules
rondeau
was
as
his
father
had
stated
top
dog
among
the
rondeau
it
was
apparent
had
no
stomach
for
bryce
style
of
combat
he
wanted
a
fight
and
kept
rushing
hoping
to
clinch
if
he
could
but
get
his
great
hands
on
bryce
he
would
wrestle
him
down
climb
him
and
finish
the
fight
in
but
a
was
exactly
what
bryce
was
striving
to
avoid
hence
when
rondeau
rushed
bryce
and
peppered
the
woodsman
ribs
but
the
which
by
now
was
ringed
around
them
began
to
voice
disapproval
of
this
style
of
battle
clinch
with
him
a
voice
roared
tie
into
him
rondeau
another
shouted
it
a
fair
match
cried
another
and
the
red
one
picked
on
the
main
push
he
was
looking
for
a
fight
an
he
ought
to
get
it
but
these
fancy
fights
do
suit
me
flop
him
stranger
flop
rondeau
ca
catch
him
a
fourth
man
jeered
he
a
not
a
suddenly
two
powerful
hands
were
placed
between
bryce
shoulders
effectually
halting
his
backward
progress
then
he
was
propelled
violently
forward
until
he
collided
with
rondeau
with
a
bellow
of
triumph
the
arms
were
around
bryce
swinging
him
until
he
faced
the
man
who
had
forced
him
into
that
terrible
grip
this
was
no
less
a
personage
than
colonel
seth
pennington
and
it
was
obvious
he
had
taken
charge
of
what
he
considered
the
obsequies
stand
back
you
men
and
give
them
room
he
shouted
rondeau
will
take
care
of
him
now
stand
back
i
say
i
discharge
the
man
that
with
a
heave
and
a
grunt
rondeau
lifted
his
antagonist
and
the
pair
went
crashing
to
the
earth
together
bryce
underneath
and
then
something
happened
with
a
howl
of
pain
rondeau
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
lay
clasping
his
left
wrist
in
his
right
hand
while
bryce
scrambled
to
his
feet
the
good
old
does
the
trick
he
announced
and
stooping
he
grasped
the
by
the
collar
with
his
left
hand
lifted
him
and
struck
him
a
terrible
blow
in
the
face
with
his
right
but
for
the
arm
that
upheld
him
rondeau
would
have
fallen
to
have
him
fall
however
was
not
part
of
bryce
plan
jerking
the
fellow
toward
him
he
passed
his
arm
around
rondeau
neck
holding
the
latter
head
as
in
a
vise
with
the
crook
of
his
elbow
and
then
the
battering
started
when
it
was
finished
bryce
let
his
man
go
and
rondeau
bloody
sobbing
and
sprawled
on
the
ground
bryce
bent
over
him
now
damn
you
he
roared
who
felled
that
tree
in
cardigan
redwoods
i
did
enough
i
confess
the
words
were
a
whisper
did
colonel
pennington
suggest
it
to
you
he
want
ze
burl
by
gar
i
do
not
want
to
fell
zat
tree
that
all
i
want
to
stooping
bryce
seized
rondeau
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
the
slack
of
his
overalls
lifted
him
and
threw
him
as
one
throws
a
sack
of
meal
full
at
colonel
pennington
you
threw
me
at
him
now
i
throw
him
at
you
you
damned
thieving
greedy
hypocritical
scoundrel
if
it
were
for
your
years
and
your
gray
hair
i
kill
the
helpless
hulk
of
the
descended
upon
the
expansive
chest
and
sent
him
crashing
earthward
then
bryce
turned
to
face
the
ring
of
laguna
grande
employees
about
him
next
he
roared
singly
in
pairs
or
the
whole
damned
pack
mr
cardigan
he
turned
colonel
pennington
breath
had
been
knocked
out
of
his
body
by
the
impact
of
his
and
he
lay
inert
gasping
like
a
hooked
fish
beside
him
shirley
sumner
was
kneeling
her
hands
clasping
her
uncle
but
with
her
violet
eyes
blazing
fiercely
on
bryce
cardigan
how
dare
you
she
cried
you
coward
to
hurt
my
uncle
he
gazed
at
her
a
moment
fiercely
defiantly
his
chest
rising
and
falling
from
his
recent
exertions
his
knotted
fists
gory
with
the
blood
of
his
enemy
then
the
light
of
battle
died
and
he
hung
his
head
sorry
he
murmured
not
for
his
sake
but
yours
i
did
know
you
were
here
i
forgot
i
never
speak
to
you
again
so
long
as
i
live
she
burst
out
passionately
he
advanced
a
step
and
stood
gazing
down
upon
her
her
angry
glance
met
his
unflinchingly
and
presently
for
him
the
light
went
out
of
the
world
very
well
he
murmured
and
with
bowed
head
he
turned
and
made
off
through
the
green
timber
toward
his
own
five
miles
distant
chapter
xvi
with
the
descent
upon
his
breast
of
the
limp
body
of
his
big
colonel
pennington
had
been
struck
to
earth
as
effectively
as
if
a
tree
had
fallen
on
him
indeed
with
such
force
did
his
proud
head
collide
with
terra
firma
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
soft
cushion
of
ferns
and
tiny
redwood
twigs
his
neck
must
have
been
broken
by
the
shock
to
complete
his
withdrawal
from
active
service
the
last
whiff
of
breath
had
been
driven
from
his
lungs
and
for
the
space
of
a
minute
during
which
jules
rondeau
lay
heavily
across
his
midriff
the
colonel
was
quite
unable
to
get
it
back
pale
gasping
and
jarred
from
soul
to
suspenders
he
was
merely
aware
that
something
unexpected
and
disconcerting
had
occurred
while
the
colonel
fought
for
his
breath
his
woodsmen
remained
in
the
offing
paralyzed
into
inactivity
by
reason
of
the
swiftness
and
thoroughness
of
bryce
cardigan
work
then
shirley
motioned
to
them
to
remove
the
wreckage
and
they
hastened
to
obey
freed
from
the
weight
on
the
geometric
centre
of
his
being
colonel
pennington
stretched
his
legs
rolled
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
snorted
violently
several
times
like
a
buck
after
the
sixth
snort
he
felt
so
much
better
that
a
clear
understanding
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
catastrophe
came
to
him
he
struggled
and
sat
up
looking
around
a
little
wildly
where
did
cardigan
go
he
gasped
one
of
his
men
pointed
to
the

pennington
ordered
i
give
a
pay
to
each
of
the
six
men
that
bring
that
scoundrel
to
me
get
him
quickly
understand
not

pennington
shook
with
fury
get
him
he
croaked
there
are
enough
of
you
to
do
the
job
close
in
on
him
everybody
i
give
a
month
pay
to
a
man
of
that
indiscriminate
mixture
of
spaniard
and
indian
known
in
california
as
cholo
swept
the
circle
of
men
with
an
alert
and
knowing
glance
his
name
was
flavio
artelan
but
his
straight
black
hair
dark
russet
complexion
beady
eyes
and
hawk
nose
gave
him
such
a
resemblance
to
a
fowl
that
he
was
known
among
his
fellows
as
the
black
minorca
regardless
of
the
fact
that
this
sobriquet
was
scarcely
fair
to
a
very
excellent
breed
of
chicken
that
offer
good
enough
for
me
he
remarked
in
businesslike
tones
come
on
everybody
a
month
pay
for
five
minutes
work
i
would
tackle
the
job
with
six
men
but
there
are
twenty
of
us
hurry
the
colonel
urged
them
shirley
sumner
flashing
glance
rested
upon
the
black
minorca
you
dare
she
cried
twenty
to
one
for
shame
for
a
month
pay
he
replied
impudently
and
grinned
evilly
and
takin
orders
from
my
he
started
on
a
for
the
timber
and
a
dozen
men
trailed
after
him
shirley
turned
helplessly
on
her
uncle
seized
his
arm
and
shook
it
frantically
call
them
back
call
them
back
she
pleaded
her
uncle
got
uncertainly
to
his
feet
not
on
your
life
he
growled
and
in
his
cold
gray
eyes
there
danced
the
lights
of
a
thousand
devils
i
told
you
the
fellow
was
a
ruffian
now
perhaps
you
believe
me
we
hold
him
until
rondeau
revives
and
then
shirley
guessed
the
rest
and
she
realized
that
it
was
useless
to
plead
that
she
was
only
wasting
time
bryce
bryce
she
called
run
they
after
you
twenty
of
them
run
run
for
my
sake
his
voice
answered
her
from
the
timber
run
from
those
cattle
not
from
man
or
a
silence
then
so
you
changed
your
mind
have
you
you
spoken
to
me
again
there
was
triumph
exultation
in
his
voice
the
timber
too
thick
shirley
i
could
get
away
anyhow
so
i
coming
she
saw
him
burst
through
a
thicket
of
alder
saplings
into
the
clearing
saw
half
a
dozen
of
her
uncle
men
close
in
around
him
like
wolves
around
a
sick
steer
and
at
the
shock
of
their
contact
she
moaned
and
hid
her
face
in
her
trembling
hands
half
man
and
half
tiger
that
he
was
the
black
minorca
as
leader
reached
bryce
first
the
cholo
was
a
squat
powerful
little
man
with
more
bounce
to
him
than
a
rubber
ball
leading
his
men
by
a
dozen
yards
he
hesitated
not
an
instant
but
dodged
under
the
blow
bryce
lashed
out
at
him
and
came
up
inside
the
latter
guard
feeling
for
bryce
throat
instead
he
met
bryce
knee
in
his
abdomen
and
forthwith
he
folded
up
like
an
accordion
the
next
instant
bryce
had
stooped
caught
him
by
the
slack
of
the
trousers
and
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
thrown
him
as
he
had
thrown
rondeau
into
the
midst
of
the
men
advancing
to
his
aid
three
of
them
went
down
backward
and
bryce
charging
over
them
stretched
two
more
with
blows
from
left
and
right
and
continued
on
across
the
clearing
running
at
top
speed
for
he
realized
that
for
all
the
desperation
of
his
fight
and
the
losses
already
inflicted
on
his
assailants
the
odds
against
him
were
insurmountable
seeing
him
running
away
the
laguna
grande
took
heart
and
hope
and
pursued
him
straight
for
the
loading
donkey
at
the
bryce
ran
beside
the
donkey
stood
a
neat
tier
of
firewood
in
the
chopping
block
where
the
had
driven
it
prior
to
abandoning
his
post
to
view
the
contest
between
bryce
and
jules
rondeau
was
a
axe
bryce
jerked
it
loose
swung
it
whirled
on
his
pursuers
and
rushed
them
like
turkeys
scattering
before
the
raid
of
a
coyote
they
fled
in
divers
directions
and
from
a
safe
distance
turned
to
gaze
apprehensively
upon
this
demon
they
had
been
ordered
to
bring
in
bryce
lowered
the
axe
removed
his
hat
and
mopped
his
moist
brow
from
the
centre
of
the
clearing
men
were
crawling
or
staggering
to
safety
with
the
exception
of
the
black
minorca
who
lay
moaning
softly
colonel
pennington
seeing
his
fondest
hopes
expire
lost
his
head
completely
get
off
my
property
you
savage
he
shrilled
do
be
a
nut
colonel
bryce
returned
soothingly
i
get
off
when
i
get
good
and
ready
and
not
a
second
sooner
in
fact
i
was
trying
to
get
off
as
rapidly
as
i
could
when
you
sent
your
men
to
bring
me
back
prithee
why
old
thing
didst
crave
more
conversation
with
me
or
didst
want
thy
camp
cleaned
out
he
started
toward
pennington
who
backed
hastily
away
shirley
stood
her
ground
bending
upon
bryce
as
he
approached
her
a
cold
and
disapproving
glance
i
get
you
yet
the
colonel
declared
from
the
shelter
of
an
old
stump
behind
which
he
had
taken
refuge
barking
dogs
never
bite
colonel
and
that
reminds
me
i
heard
enough
from
you
one
more
cheep
out
of
you
my
friend
and
i
go
up
to
my
own
return
here
with
a
crew
of
bluenoses
and
wild
irish
and
run
your
wops
bohunks
and
cholos
out
of
the
county
i
do
fancy
the
class
of
labour
you
importing
into
this
county
the
colonel
evidently
deciding
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valour
promptly
subsided
although
bryce
could
see
that
he
was
mumbling
threats
to
himself
though
not
in
an
audible
voice
the
demon
cardigan
halted
beside
shirley
and
stood
gazing
down
at
her
he
was
smiling
at
her
whimsically
she
met
his
glance
for
a
few
seconds
then
her
lids
were
lowered
and
she
bit
her
lip
with
vexation
shirley
he
said
you
are
presumptuous
she
quavered
you
set
me
an
example
in
presumption
he
retorted
good
humouredly
did
you
not
call
me
by
my
first
name
a
minute
ago
he
glanced
toward
colonel
pennington
and
observed
the
latter
with
his
neck
craned
across
his
protecting
stump
he
was
all
ears
bryce
pointed
sternly
across
the
clearing
and
the
colonel
promptly
abandoned
his
refuge
and
retreated
hastily
in
the
direction
indicated
the
heir
to
cardigan
redwoods
bent
over
the
girl
you
spoke
to
me
after
your
promise
not
to
shirley
he
said
gently
you
will
always
speak
to
she
commenced
to
cry
softly
i
loathe
you
she
sobbed
for
you
i
have
the
utmost
respect
and
admiration
he
replied
no
you
have
if
you
had
you
would
hurt
my
uncle
the
only
human
being
in
all
this
world
who
is
dear
to
gosh
he
murmured
plaintively
i
jealous
of
that
man
however
sorry
i
hurt
him
he
is
no
longer
young
while
i
well
i
forgot
the
chivalry
my
daddy
taught
me
i
give
you
my
word
i
came
here
to
fight
fairly
he
merely
tried
to
stop
you
from
no
he
did
shirley
he
interfered
and
fouled
me
still
despite
that
if
i
had
known
you
were
a
spectator
i
think
i
should
have
controlled
myself
and
refrained
from
pulling
off
my
vengeance
in
your
presence
i
shall
never
cease
to
regret
that
i
subjected
you
to
such
a
distressing
spectacle
i
do
hope
however
that
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
i
am
not
a
bully
although
when
there
is
a
fight
worth
while
i
never
dodge
it
and
this
time
i
fought
for
the
honour
of
the
house
of
if
you
want
me
to
believe
that
you
will
beg
my
uncle
i
ca
do
that
he
is
my
enemy
and
i
shall
hate
him
forever
i
shall
fight
him
and
his
way
of
doing
business
until
he
reforms
or
i
am
she
looked
up
at
him
showing
a
face
in
which
resentment
outrage
and
wistfulness
were
mirrored
you
realize
of
course
what
your
insistence
on
that
plan
means
cardigan
call
me
bryce
he
pleaded
you
going
to
call
me
that
some
day
anyhow
so
why
not
start
now
you
are
altogether
insufferable
sir
please
go
away
and
never
presume
to
address
me
again
you
are
quite
he
shook
his
head
i
do
not
give
up
that
readily
shirley
i
know
how
dear
what
your
friendship
meant
to
me
until
you
sent
me
away
i
did
think
there
was
any
hope
until
you
warned
me
those
dogs
were
hunting
me
and
called
me
he
held
out
his
hand
gave
us
our
relations
he
quoted
thank
god
we
can
choose
our
friends
and
i
be
a
good
friend
to
you
shirley
sumner
until
i
have
earned
the
right
to
be
something
more
wo
you
shake
hands
with
me
remember
this
fight
is
only
the
first
skirmish
in
a
war
to
the
finish
and
i
am
leading
a
forlorn
hope
if
i
lose
well
this
will
be
i
hate
you
she
answered
drearily
all
our
fine
friendship
smashed
and
you
growing
stupidly
sentimental
i
think
it
of
you
please
go
away
you
are
distressing
he
smiled
at
her
tenderly
forgivingly
wistfully
but
she
did
not
see
it
then
it
is
really
he
murmured
with
mock
dolorousness
she
nodded
her
bowed
head
yes
she
whispered
after
all
i
have
some
pride
you
know
you
must
presume
to
be
the
butterfly
preaching
contentment
to
the
toad
in
the
as
you
will
it
he
turned
away
i
send
your
axe
back
with
the
first
trainload
of
logs
from
my
camp
colonel
he
called
to
pennington
once
more
he
strode
away
into
the
timber
shirley
watched
him
pass
out
of
her
life
and
gloried
in
what
she
conceived
to
be
his
agony
for
she
had
both
temper
and
spirit
and
bryce
cardigan
calmly
blunderingly
rather
stupidly
she
thought
had
presumed
flagrantly
on
brief
acquaintance
her
uncle
was
right
he
was
not
of
their
kind
of
people
and
it
was
well
she
had
discovered
this
before
permitting
herself
to
develop
a
livelier
feeling
of
friendship
for
him
it
was
true
he
possessed
certain
manly
virtues
but
his
crudities
by
far
outweighed
these
the
colonel
voice
broke
in
upon
her
bitter
reflections
that
fellow
cardigan
is
a
hard
nut
to
crack
i
say
that
for
he
had
crossed
the
clearing
to
her
side
and
was
addressing
her
with
his
customary
air
of
expansiveness
i
think
my
dear
you
had
better
go
back
into
the
caboose
away
from
the
prying
eyes
of
these
rough
fellows
i
sorry
you
came
shirley
i
never
forgive
myself
for
bringing
you
if
i
had
thought
but
how
could
i
know
that
scoundrel
was
coming
here
to
raise
a
disturbance
and
only
last
night
he
was
at
our
house
for
dinner
that
just
what
makes
it
so
terrible
uncle
seth
she
quavered
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
a
man
of
young
cardigan
evident
intelligence
and
advantages
could
be
such
a
boor
shirley
however
i
for
one
am
not
surprised
you
will
recall
that
i
warned
you
he
might
be
his
father
son
the
best
course
to
pursue
now
is
to
forget
that
you
have
ever
met
the
i
wonder
what
could
have
occurred
to
make
such
a
madman
of
him
the
girl
queried
wonderingly
he
acted
more
like
a
demon
than
a
human
just
like
his
old
father
the
colonel
purred
benevolently
when
he
ca
get
what
he
wants
he
sulks
i
tell
you
what
got
on
his
confounded
nerves
i
been
freighting
logs
for
the
senior
cardigan
over
my
railroad
the
contract
for
hauling
them
was
a
heritage
from
old
bill
henderson
from
whom
i
bought
the
mill
and
and
of
course
as
his
assignee
it
was
incumbent
upon
me
to
fulfill
contract
with
cardigan
even
though
the
was
ruinous
well
this
morning
young
cardigan
came
to
my
office
reminded
me
that
the
contract
would
expire
by
limitation
next
year
and
asked
me
to
renew
it
and
at
the
same
i
offered
to
renew
the
contract
but
at
a
higher
and
explained
to
him
that
i
could
not
possibly
continue
to
haul
his
logs
at
a
loss
well
right
away
he
flew
into
a
rage
and
called
me
a
robber
whereupon
i
informed
him
that
since
he
thought
me
a
robber
perhaps
we
had
better
not
attempt
to
have
any
business
dealings
with
each
other
that
i
really
did
want
his
contract
at
any
price
having
scarcely
sufficient
to
handle
my
own
logs
that
made
him
calm
down
but
in
a
little
while
he
lost
his
head
again
and
grew
snarly
and
abusive
to
such
an
extent
indeed
that
finally
i
was
forced
to
ask
him
to
leave
my
nevertheless
uncle
seth
i
can
not
understand
why
he
should
make
such
a
furious
attack
upon
your
the
colonel
laughed
with
a
fair
imitation
of
sincerity
and
tolerant
amusement
my
dear
that
is
no
mystery
to
me
there
are
men
who
finding
it
impossible
or
inadvisable
to
make
a
physical
attack
upon
their
enemy
find
ample
satisfaction
in
poisoning
his
favourite
dog
burning
his
house
or
beating
up
one
of
his
faithful
employees
cardigan
picked
on
rondeau
for
the
reason
that
a
few
days
ago
he
tried
to
hire
rondeau
away
from
me
offered
him
dollars
a
month
more
than
i
was
paying
him
by
george
of
course
when
rondeau
came
to
me
with
cardigan
proposition
i
promptly
met
cardigan
bid
and
retained
rondeau
consequently
cardigan
hates
us
both
and
took
the
earliest
opportunity
to
vent
his
spite
on
the
colonel
sighed
and
brushed
the
dirt
and
leaves
from
his
tweeds
thunder
he
continued
philosophically
it
all
in
the
game
so
why
worry
over
it
and
why
continue
to
discuss
an
unpleasant
topic
my
dear
a
groan
from
the
black
minorca
challenged
her
attention
i
think
that
man
is
badly
hurt
uncle
she
suggested
serves
him
right
he
returned
coldly
he
tackled
that
cyclone
full
twenty
feet
in
advance
of
the
others
if
they
all
closed
in
together
they
would
have
pulled
him
down
i
have
that
cholo
and
rondeau
sent
down
with
the
next
trainload
of
logs
to
the
company
hospital
they
a
poor
lot
and
deserve
manhandling
they
paused
facing
toward
the
timber
from
which
came
a
voice
powerful
sweetly
resonant
raised
in
song
shirley
knew
that
baritone
for
she
had
heard
it
the
night
before
when
bryce
cardigan
faking
his
own
accompaniment
at
the
piano
had
sung
for
her
a
number
of
carefully
expurgated
lumberjack
ballads
the
lunatic
humour
of
which
had
delighted
her
exceedingly
she
marvelled
now
at
his
choice
of
minstrelsy
for
the
melody
was
hauntingly
plaintive
the
words
eugene
field
poem
of
childhood
little
boy
the
little
toy
dog
is
covered
with
dust
but
sturdy
and
stanch
he
stands
and
the
little
toy
soldier
is
red
with
rust
and
his
musket
molds
in
his
hands
time
was
when
the
little
toy
dog
was
new
and
the
soldier
was
passing
fair
and
that
was
the
time
when
our
little
boy
blue
kissed
them
and
put
them
devil
is
he
the
colonel
commented
approvingly
and
his
voice
is
half
bad
just
singing
to
be
defiant
i
shirley
did
not
answer
but
a
few
minutes
previously
she
had
seen
the
singer
a
raging
fury
brandishing
an
axe
and
driving
men
before
him
she
could
not
understand
and
presently
the
song
grew
faint
among
the
timber
and
died
away
entirely
her
uncle
took
her
gently
by
the
arm
and
steered
her
toward
the
caboose
well
what
do
you
think
of
your
company
now
he
demanded
gayly
i
think
she
answered
soberly
that
you
have
gained
an
enemy
worth
while
and
that
it
behooves
you
not
to
underestimate
chapter
xvii
through
the
green
timber
bryce
cardigan
strode
and
there
was
a
lilt
in
his
heart
now
already
he
had
forgotten
the
desperate
situation
from
which
he
had
just
escaped
he
thought
only
of
shirley
sumner
face
with
terror
and
because
he
knew
that
at
least
some
of
those
tears
had
been
inspired
by
the
gravest
apprehensions
as
to
his
physical
because
in
his
ears
there
still
resounded
her
frantic
warning
he
realized
that
however
stern
her
decree
of
banishment
had
been
she
was
nevertheless
not
indifferent
to
him
and
it
was
this
knowledge
that
had
thrilled
him
into
song
and
which
when
his
song
was
done
had
brought
to
his
firm
mouth
a
mobility
that
presaged
his
old
whimsical
smile
to
his
brown
eyes
a
beaming
light
of
confidence
and
pride
the
climax
had
been
reached
and
passed
and
the
result
had
been
far
from
the
disaster
he
had
painted
in
his
mind
eye
ever
since
the
knowledge
had
come
to
him
that
he
was
doomed
to
battle
to
a
knockout
with
colonel
pennington
and
that
one
of
the
earliest
fruits
of
hostilities
would
doubtless
be
the
loss
of
shirley
sumner
prized
friendship
well
he
had
lost
her
friendship
but
a
still
small
voice
whispered
to
him
that
the
loss
was
not
irreparable
whereat
he
swung
his
axe
as
a
bandmaster
swings
his
baton
he
was
glad
that
he
had
started
the
war
and
was
now
free
to
fight
it
out
unhampered
up
hill
and
down
dale
he
went
because
of
the
tremendous
trees
he
could
not
see
the
sun
yet
with
the
instinct
of
the
woodsman
an
instinct
as
infallible
as
that
of
a
homing
pigeon
he
was
not
puzzled
as
to
direction
within
two
hours
his
long
tireless
stride
brought
him
out
into
a
clearing
in
the
valley
where
his
own
stood
he
went
directly
to
the
where
in
a
listless
and
manner
the
loading
crew
were
piling
logs
on
pennington
bryce
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
two
at
pennington
locomotive
would
appear
to
back
in
and
couple
to
the
long
line
of
trucks
and
the
train
was
only
half
loaded
where
mctavish
bryce
demanded
of
the
the
man
mouthed
his
quid
spat
copiously
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
pointed
up
at
his
shanty
he
made
answer
and
grinned
at
bryce
knowingly
up
through
the
camp
single
short
street
flanked
on
each
side
with
the
woodsmen
shanties
bryce
went
dogs
barked
at
him
for
he
was
a
stranger
in
his
own
camp
children
playing
in
the
dust
gazed
upon
him
owlishly
at
the
most
pretentious
shanty
on
the
street
bryce
turned
in
he
had
never
seen
it
before
but
he
knew
it
to
be
the
home
for
unlike
its
neighbours
the
house
was
painted
with
the
coarse
red
paint
that
is
used
on
while
a
fence
made
of
fancy
pointed
pickets
painted
white
inclosed
a
tiny
garden
in
front
of
the
house
as
bryce
came
through
the
gate
a
young
girl
rose
from
where
she
knelt
in
a
bed
of
freshly
transplanted
pansies
bryce
lifted
his
hat
is
mctavish
at
home
he
asked
she
nodded
he
can
not
see
anybody
she
hastened
to
add
he
i
think
he
see
me
and
i
wonder
if
you
moira
yes
i
i
bryce
a
look
of
fright
crept
into
the
girl
eyes
are
you
bryce
cardigan
she
faltered
and
looked
at
him
more
closely
yes
you
bryce
you
changed
but
then
it
been
six
years
since
we
saw
you
last
he
came
toward
her
with
outstretched
hand
and
you
were
a
little
girl
when
i
saw
you
last
now
you
a
she
grasped
his
hand
with
the
frank
heartiness
of
a
man
i
mighty
glad
to
meet
you
again
moira
i
just
guessed
who
you
were
for
of
course
i
should
never
have
recognized
you
when
i
saw
you
last
you
wore
your
hair
in
a
braid
down
your
i
twenty
years
old
she
informed
him
stand
right
where
you
are
until
i
have
looked
at
you
he
commanded
and
backed
off
a
few
feet
the
better
to
contemplate
her
he
saw
a
girl
slightly
above
medium
height
tanned
robust
simply
gowned
in
a
gingham
dress
her
hands
were
soiled
from
her
recent
labours
in
the
and
her
shoes
were
heavy
and
coarse
yet
neither
hands
nor
feet
were
large
or
ungraceful
her
head
was
well
formed
her
hair
jet
black
and
of
unusual
lustre
and
abundance
was
parted
in
the
middle
and
held
in
an
coil
at
the
nape
of
a
neck
the
beauty
of
which
was
revealed
by
the
low
cut
of
her
simple
frock
moira
was
a
decided
brunette
with
that
wonderful
quality
of
skin
to
be
seen
only
among
brunettes
who
have
roses
in
their
cheeks
her
brow
was
broad
and
spiritual
in
her
eyes
large
black
and
listrous
there
was
a
brooding
tenderness
not
untouched
with
sorrow
some
such
expression
indeed
as
da
vinci
put
in
the
eyes
of
his
mona
lisa
her
nose
was
patrician
her
face
oval
her
lips
full
and
red
were
slightly
parted
in
the
adorable
cupid
bow
which
is
the
inevitable
heritage
of
a
short
upper
lip
her
teeth
were
white
as
parian
marble
and
her
full
breast
was
rising
and
falling
swiftly
as
if
she
laboured
under
suppressed
excitement
so
delightful
a
picture
did
moira
mctavish
make
that
bryce
forgot
all
his
troubles
in
her
sweet
presence
by
the
gods
moira
he
declared
earnestly
you
a
peach
when
i
saw
you
last
you
were
awkward
and
leggy
like
a
colt
i
sure
you
were
a
bit
and
now
you
the
most
ravishing
young
lady
in
seventeen
counties
by
jingo
moira
you
a
stunner
and
no
mistake
are
you
married
she
shook
her
head
blushing
pleasurably
at
his
unpolished
but
sincere
compliments
what
not
married
why
what
the
deuce
can
be
the
matter
with
the
eligible
young
fellows
hereabouts
there
are
any
eligible
young
fellows
hereabouts
bryce
and
lived
in
these
woods
all
my
that
why
you
have
been
and
i
do
intend
to
marry
a
lumberjack
and
continue
to
live
in
these
woods
she
went
on
earnestly
as
if
she
found
pleasure
in
this
opportunity
to
announce
her
rebellion
despite
her
defiance
however
there
was
a
note
of
sad
resignation
in
her
voice
you
do
know
a
thing
about
it
moira
some
bright
day
your
prince
charming
will
come
by
riding
the
and
after
that
it
will
always
be
autumn
in
the
woods
for
you
everything
will
just
naturally
turn
to
crimson
and
how
do
you
know
mr
bryce
he
laughed
i
read
about
it
in
a
i
prefer
spring
in
the
woods
i
think
it
seems
it
so
foolish
of
me
i
know
i
ought
to
be
contented
but
it
hard
to
be
contented
when
it
is
always
winter
in
one
heart
that
frieze
of
timber
on
the
skyline
limits
my
world
mr
bryce
hills
and
timber
timber
and
hills
and
the
thunder
of
falling
redwoods
and
when
the
trees
have
been
logged
off
so
we
can
see
the
world
we
move
back
into
green
timber
she
sighed
are
you
lonely
moira
she
nodded
poor
moira
he
murmured
absently
the
thought
that
he
so
readily
understood
touched
her
a
glint
of
tears
was
in
her
sad
eyes
he
saw
them
and
placed
his
arm
fraternally
around
her
shoulders
moira
do
cry
he
soothed
her
i
understand
perfectly
and
of
course
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
you
too
fine
for
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
he
indicated
the
camp
he
had
led
her
to
the
low
stoop
in
front
of
the
shanty
sit
down
on
the
steps
moira
and
we
talk
it
over
i
really
called
to
see
your
father
but
i
guess
i
do
want
to
see
him
after
all
if
he
she
looked
at
him
bravely
i
did
know
you
at
first
bryce
i
fibbed
father
is
sick
he
i
thought
so
when
i
saw
the
taking
it
easy
at
the
i
terribly
i
loathe
it
and
i
can
not
leave
it
she
burst
out
vehemently
chained
to
my
degradation
i
dream
dreams
and
they
never
come
true
i
i
oh
bryce
bryce
i
so
so
am
i
he
retorted
we
all
get
our
dose
of
it
you
know
and
just
at
present
i
having
an
extra
helping
it
seems
you
cursed
with
too
much
imagination
moira
i
sorry
about
your
father
he
been
with
us
a
long
time
and
my
father
has
borne
a
lot
from
him
for
old
sake
sake
he
told
me
the
other
night
that
he
has
discharged
mac
fourteen
times
during
the
past
ten
years
but
to
date
he
has
been
able
to
make
it
stick
for
all
his
sixty
years
moira
your
confounded
parent
can
still
manhandle
any
man
on
the
and
as
fast
as
dad
put
in
a
new
old
mac
drove
him
off
the
job
he
simply
declines
to
be
fired
and
dad
worn
out
and
too
tired
to
bother
about
his
old
any
more
he
been
waiting
until
i
should
get
i
know
said
moira
wearily
nobody
wants
to
be
cardigan
and
have
to
fight
my
father
to
hold
his
job
i
realize
what
a
nuisance
he
has
bryce
chuckled
i
asked
father
why
he
did
stand
pat
and
let
mac
work
for
nothing
having
discharged
him
my
father
was
under
no
obligation
to
give
him
his
salary
just
because
he
insisted
on
being
dad
might
have
starved
your
father
out
of
these
woods
but
the
trouble
was
that
old
mac
would
always
come
and
promise
reform
and
end
up
by
borrowing
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
and
then
dad
had
to
hire
him
again
to
get
it
back
of
course
the
matter
simmers
down
to
this
dad
is
so
fond
of
your
father
that
he
just
has
got
the
moral
courage
to
work
him
over
and
now
that
job
is
up
to
me
moira
i
not
going
to
beat
about
the
bush
with
you
they
tell
me
your
father
is
a
hopeless
i
afraid
he
is
how
long
has
he
been
drinking
to
excess
about
ten
years
i
think
of
course
he
would
always
take
a
few
drinks
with
the
men
around
but
after
mother
died
he
began
taking
his
drinks
between
then
he
took
to
going
down
to
sequoia
on
saturday
nights
and
coming
back
on
the
the
maddest
of
the
lot
i
suppose
he
was
lonely
too
he
did
get
real
bad
however
till
about
two
years
just
about
the
time
my
father
eyes
began
to
fail
him
and
he
ceased
coming
up
into
the
woods
to
jack
mac
up
so
he
let
the
brakes
go
and
started
to
coast
and
now
he
reached
the
bottom
i
could
get
him
on
the
telephone
or
yesterday
i
suppose
he
was
down
in
arcata
liquoring
she
nodded
miserably
well
we
have
to
get
logs
to
the
mill
and
we
ca
get
them
with
old
john
barleycorn
for
a
moira
so
we
going
to
change
and
the
new
will
not
be
driven
off
the
job
because
i
going
to
stay
up
here
a
couple
of
weeks
and
break
him
in
myself
by
the
way
is
mac
ugly
in
his
cups
thank
god
no
she
answered
fervently
drunk
or
sober
he
has
never
said
an
unkind
word
to
but
how
do
you
manage
to
get
money
to
clothe
yourself
sinclair
tells
me
mac
needs
every
cent
of
his
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month
to
enjoy
i
used
to
steal
from
him
the
girl
admitted
then
i
grew
ashamed
of
that
and
for
the
past
six
months
i
been
earning
my
own
living
sinclair
was
very
kind
he
gave
me
a
job
waiting
on
table
in
the
camp
dining
room
you
see
i
had
to
have
something
here
i
could
leave
my
father
he
had
to
have
somebody
to
take
care
of
him
do
you
see
bryce
sinclair
is
a
fuzzy
old
fool
bryce
declared
with
emphasis
the
idea
of
our
daughter
slinging
hash
to
lumberjacks
poor
moira
he
took
one
of
her
hands
in
his
noting
the
callous
spots
on
the
plump
palm
the
thick
that
hinted
so
of
toil
the
nails
that
had
never
been
manicured
save
by
moira
herself
do
you
remember
when
i
was
a
boy
moira
how
i
used
to
come
up
to
the
to
hunt
and
fish
i
always
lived
with
the
mctavishes
then
and
in
september
when
the
huckleberries
were
ripe
we
used
to
go
out
and
pick
them
together
poor
moira
why
we
old
pals
and
i
be
shot
if
i
going
to
see
you
she
glanced
at
him
shyly
with
beaming
eyes
you
have
changed
a
bit
bryce
not
one
little
bit
let
talk
about
you
moira
you
went
to
school
in
sequoia
you
yes
i
was
graduated
from
the
high
school
there
i
used
to
ride
the
into
town
and
back
good
news
listen
moira
i
going
to
fire
your
father
as
i
said
because
he
working
for
old
now
not
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
i
really
ought
to
pension
him
after
his
long
years
in
the
cardigan
service
but
i
be
hanged
if
we
can
afford
pensions
any
more
particularly
to
keep
a
man
in
booze
so
the
best
our
old
gets
from
me
is
this
shanty
or
another
like
it
when
we
move
to
new
cuttings
and
a
perpetual
for
our
camp
dining
room
while
the
cardigans
remain
in
business
i
finance
him
for
a
trip
to
some
state
institution
where
they
sometimes
reclaim
such
wreckage
if
i
did
think
he
too
old
a
dog
to
be
taught
new
perhaps
she
suggested
sadly
you
had
better
talk
the
matter
over
with
no
i
rather
not
i
fond
of
your
father
moira
he
was
a
man
when
i
saw
him
last
such
a
man
as
these
woods
will
never
see
again
and
i
do
want
to
see
him
again
until
he
cold
sober
i
write
him
a
letter
as
for
you
moira
you
fired
too
i
not
have
you
waiting
on
table
in
my
not
by
a
jugful
you
to
come
down
to
sequoia
and
go
to
work
in
our
office
we
can
use
you
on
the
books
helping
sinclair
and
relieve
him
of
the
task
of
billing
checking
tallies
and
looking
after
the
i
pay
you
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
moira
can
you
get
along
on
that
her
hard
hand
closed
over
his
tightly
but
she
did
not
speak
all
right
moira
it
a
go
then
hills
and
timber
timber
and
hills
and
i
going
to
set
you
free
perhaps
in
sequoia
you
find
your
prince
charming
there
there
girl
do
cry
we
cardigans
had
years
of
faithful
service
from
donald
mctavish
before
he
commenced
slipping
after
all
we
owe
him
something
i
she
drew
his
hand
suddenly
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
her
hot
tears
of
joy
fell
on
it
but
her
heart
was
too
full
for
mere
words
moira
buck
up
he
protested
hugely
pleased
but
embarrassed
withal
the
way
you
take
this
one
would
think
you
had
expected
me
to
go
back
on
an
old
pal
and
had
been
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
did
cheer
up
moira
cherries
are
ripe
or
at
any
rate
they
soon
will
be
and
if
you
just
cease
shedding
the
scalding
and
listen
to
me
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
advance
you
two
months
salary
for
well
you
need
a
lot
of
clothes
and
things
in
sequoia
that
you
do
need
here
and
i
glad
i
managed
to
settle
the
mctavish
hash
without
kicking
up
a
row
and
hurting
your
feelings
poor
old
mac
sorry
i
ca
bear
with
him
but
we
simply
have
to
have
the
logs
you
he
rose
stooped
and
pinched
her
ear
for
had
he
not
known
her
since
childhood
and
had
they
not
gathered
huckleberries
together
in
the
long
ago
she
was
sister
to
him
just
another
one
of
his
problems
and
nothing
more
report
on
the
job
as
soon
as
possible
moira
he
called
to
her
from
the
gate
then
the
gate
banged
behind
him
and
with
a
smile
and
a
debonair
wave
of
his
hand
he
was
striding
down
the
little
camp
street
where
the
dogs
and
the
children
played
in
the
dust
after
a
while
moira
walked
to
the
gate
and
leaning
upon
it
looked
down
the
street
toward
the
where
bryce
was
ragging
the
laggard
crew
into
some
thing
like
their
speed
presently
the
locomotive
backed
in
and
coupled
to
the
log
tram
and
when
she
saw
bryce
leap
aboard
and
seat
himself
on
a
top
log
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
not
fail
to
see
her
at
the
gate
she
waved
to
him
he
threw
her
a
careless
kiss
and
the
train
pulled
out
presently
when
moira
lifted
her
madonna
glance
to
the
frieze
of
timber
on
the
skyline
there
was
a
new
glory
in
her
eyes
and
lo
it
was
autumn
in
the
woods
for
over
that
hill
prince
charming
had
come
to
her
and
life
was
all
crimson
and
gold
when
the
train
loaded
with
cardigan
logs
crawled
in
on
the
main
track
and
stopped
at
the
in
pennington
camp
the
locomotive
uncoupled
and
backed
in
on
the
siding
for
the
purpose
of
kicking
the
caboose
in
which
shirley
and
colonel
pennington
had
ridden
to
the
woods
out
onto
the
main
line
again
where
owing
to
a
slight
downhill
grade
the
caboose
controlled
by
the
brakeman
could
coast
gently
forward
and
be
hooked
on
to
the
end
of
the
for
the
return
journey
to
sequoia
throughout
the
afternoon
shirley
following
the
battle
royal
between
bryce
and
the
pennington
retainers
had
sat
dismally
in
the
caboose
she
was
prey
to
many
conflicting
emotions
but
having
had
what
her
sex
term
a
good
cry
she
had
to
a
great
extent
recovered
her
customary
poise
and
was
busily
speculating
on
the
rapidity
with
which
she
could
leave
sequoia
and
forget
she
had
ever
met
bryce
cardigan
when
the
rumbled
into
the
landing
and
the
last
of
the
long
string
of
trucks
came
to
a
stop
directly
opposite
the
caboose
shirley
happened
to
be
looking
through
the
grimy
caboose
window
at
that
moment
on
the
top
log
of
the
load
the
object
of
her
unhappy
speculations
was
seated
apparently
quite
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
back
once
more
in
the
haunt
of
his
enemies
although
knowledge
that
the
axe
he
had
so
unceremoniously
borrowed
of
colonel
pennington
was
driven
deep
into
the
log
beside
him
with
the
haft
convenient
to
his
hand
probably
had
much
to
do
with
bryce
air
of
detached
indifference
he
was
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
chin
in
his
cupped
hands
and
a
pipe
thrust
aggressively
out
the
corner
of
his
mouth
the
while
he
stared
moodily
at
his
feet
shirley
suspected
she
knew
what
he
was
thinking
of
he
was
less
than
six
feet
from
her
and
a
morbid
fascination
moved
her
to
remain
at
the
window
and
watch
the
play
of
emotions
over
his
strong
stern
face
she
told
herself
that
should
he
move
should
he
show
the
slightest
disposition
to
raise
his
head
and
bring
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
hers
she
would
dodge
away
from
the
window
in
time
to
escape
his
scrutiny
she
reckoned
without
the
engine
with
a
smart
bump
it
struck
the
caboose
and
shunted
it
briskly
up
the
siding
at
the
sound
of
the
impact
bryce
raised
his
troubled
glance
just
in
time
to
see
shirley
body
yielding
to
the
shock
sway
into
full
view
at
the
window
with
difficulty
he
suppressed
a
grin
i
bet
my
immortal
soul
she
was
peeking
at
me
he
soliloquized
confound
the
luck
another
meeting
this
afternoon
would
be
tactfully
he
resumed
his
study
of
his
feet
not
even
looking
up
when
the
caboose
after
gaining
the
main
track
slid
gently
down
the
slight
grade
and
was
coupled
to
the
rear
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
colonel
pennington
passing
alongside
the
and
entering
the
caboose
he
heard
the
engineer
shout
to
the
brakeman
who
had
ridden
down
from
the
head
of
the
train
to
unlock
the
siding
switch
and
couple
the
caboose
to
hurry
up
lock
the
switch
and
get
back
aboard
the
engine
ca
get
this
danged
key
to
turn
in
the
lock
the
brakeman
shouted
presently
lock
rusty
and
something
gone
bust
minutes
passed
bryce
assumed
abstraction
became
real
for
he
had
many
matters
to
occupy
his
busy
brain
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
sit
idle
without
adverting
to
some
of
them
presently
he
was
subconsciously
aware
that
the
train
was
moving
gently
forward
almost
immediately
it
seemed
to
him
the
long
string
of
trucks
had
gathered
their
customary
speed
and
then
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
bryce
that
the
train
had
started
off
without
a
single
jerk
and
that
it
was
gathering
headway
rapidly
he
looked
ahead
and
his
hair
grew
creepy
at
the
roots
there
was
no
locomotive
attached
to
the
train
it
was
running
away
down
a
two
per
cent
grade
and
because
of
the
tremendous
weight
of
the
train
it
was
gathering
momentum
at
a
fearful
rate
the
reason
for
the
runaway
dawned
on
bryce
instantly
the
road
being
privately
owned
was
like
most
neglected
as
to
roadbed
and
also
it
was
undermanned
and
the
who
also
acted
as
switchman
had
failed
to
set
the
on
the
leading
truck
after
the
engineer
had
locked
the
as
a
result
during
the
five
or
six
minutes
required
to
spot
in
the
caboose
and
an
extra
minute
or
two
lost
while
the
brakeman
struggled
with
the
recalcitrant
lock
on
the
switch
the
air
had
leaked
away
through
the
worn
valves
and
rubber
tubing
and
the
brakes
had
been
released
so
that
the
train
without
warning
had
quietly
and
almost
noiselessly
slid
out
of
the
and
started
on
its
mad
career
before
the
engineer
could
beat
it
to
the
other
switch
with
the
locomotive
run
out
on
the
main
track
let
the
runaway
gradually
catch
up
with
him
and
hold
it
no
matter
how
or
what
happened
to
him
or
his
engine
the
first
had
cleared
the
switch
and
blocked
pursuit
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
save
watch
the
wild
runaway
and
pray
for
of
all
the
mad
runaways
in
a
mad
world
a
loaded
is
by
far
the
worst
for
an
instant
after
realizing
his
predicament
bryce
cardigan
was
tempted
to
jump
and
take
his
chance
on
a
few
broken
bones
before
the
train
could
reach
a
greater
speed
than
twenty
miles
an
hour
his
impulse
was
to
run
forward
and
set
the
handbrake
on
the
leading
truck
but
a
glance
showed
him
that
even
with
the
train
standing
still
he
could
not
hope
to
leap
from
truck
to
truck
and
land
on
the
round
freshly
peeled
surface
of
the
logs
without
slipping
for
he
had
no
calks
in
his
boots
and
to
slip
now
meant
swift
and
horrible
death
too
late
he
muttered
even
if
i
could
get
to
the
head
of
the
train
i
could
stop
her
with
the
should
i
succeed
in
locking
the
wheels
the
brute
would
be
doing
fifty
miles
an
hour
by
that
time
the
front
truck
would
slide
and
skid
leave
the
tracks
and
pile
up
with
me
at
the
bottom
of
a
mess
of
wrecked
and
redwood
then
he
remembered
in
the
wildly
rolling
caboose
shirley
sumner
rode
with
her
uncle
while
less
than
two
miles
ahead
the
track
swung
in
a
sharp
curve
high
up
along
the
hillside
above
mad
river
bryce
knew
the
leading
truck
would
never
take
that
curve
at
high
speed
even
if
the
ancient
should
hold
together
until
the
curve
was
reached
but
would
shoot
off
at
a
tangent
into
the
canyon
carrying
trucks
logs
and
caboose
with
it
rolling
over
and
over
down
the
hillside
to
the
river
the
caboose
must
be
cut
out
of
this
runaway
bryce
soliloquized
and
it
must
be
cut
out
in
a
devil
of
a
hurry
here
goes
nothing
in
particular
and
may
god
be
good
to
my
dear
old
he
jerked
his
axe
out
of
the
log
drove
it
deep
into
the
top
log
toward
the
end
and
by
using
the
haft
to
cling
to
crawled
toward
the
rear
of
the
load
and
looked
down
at
the
caboose
coupling
the
top
log
was
a
butt
the
two
bottom
logs
were
eighteen
footers
with
a
silent
prayer
of
thanks
to
providence
bryce
slid
down
to
the
landing
thus
formed
he
was
still
five
feet
above
the
coupling
however
but
by
leaning
over
the
swaying
bumping
edge
and
swinging
the
axe
with
one
hand
he
managed
to
cut
through
the
rubber
hose
on
the
air
connection
the
blamed
thing
might
hold
and
drag
the
caboose
along
after
pulled
out
the
he
reflected
and
i
ca
afford
to
take
chances
nevertheless
he
took
them
axe
in
hand
he
leaped
down
to
the
narrow
ledge
formed
by
the
bumper
in
front
of
the
cabooses
driving
his
face
into
the
front
of
the
caboose
and
he
only
grasped
the
steel
rod
leading
from
the
to
the
wheel
on
the
roof
in
time
to
avoid
falling
half
stunned
between
the
front
of
the
caboose
and
the
rear
of
the
the
caboose
had
once
been
a
hence
there
was
no
railed
front
platform
to
which
bryce
might
have
leaped
in
safety
clinging
perilously
on
the
bumper
he
reached
with
his
foot
got
his
toe
under
the
lever
on
the
side
jerked
it
upward
and
threw
the
pin
out
of
the
coupling
then
with
his
free
hand
he
swung
the
axe
and
drove
the
great
steel
jaws
of
the
coupling
apart
the
caboose
was
cut
out
but
already
the
deadly
curve
was
in
sight
in
two
minutes
the
first
truck
would
reach
it
and
the
caboose
though
cut
loose
had
to
be
stopped
else
with
the
headway
it
had
gathered
it
too
would
follow
the
to
glory
for
a
moment
bryce
clung
to
the
weak
and
dizzy
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
when
leaping
down
from
the
loaded
truck
to
the
caboose
bumper
his
face
had
smashed
into
the
front
of
the
caboose
his
chin
was
bruised
skinned
and
bloody
his
nose
had
been
broken
and
twin
rivulets
of
blood
ran
from
his
nostrils
he
wiped
it
away
swung
his
axe
drove
the
blade
deep
into
the
bumper
and
left
it
there
with
the
haft
quivering
turning
he
climbed
swiftly
up
the
narrow
iron
ladder
beside
the
until
he
reached
the
roof
then
still
standing
on
the
ladder
he
reached
the
and
drew
it
promptly
but
gradually
around
until
the
began
to
bite
when
he
exerted
his
tremendous
strength
to
the
utmost
and
with
his
knees
braced
doggedly
against
the
front
of
the
caboose
held
the
wheel
the
brake
screamed
but
the
speed
of
the
caboose
was
not
appreciably
slackened
it
had
too
good
a
start
bryce
moaned
the
momentum
is
more
than
i
can
overcome
oh
shirley
my
love
god
help
you
he
cast
a
sudden
despairing
look
over
his
shoulder
downward
at
the
coupling
he
was
winning
after
all
for
a
space
of
six
feet
now
yawned
between
the
end
of
the
and
the
bumper
of
the
caboose
if
he
could
but
hold
that
tremendous
strain
on
the
wheel
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
might
get
the
demon
caboose
under
control
again
he
dug
his
knees
into
the
front
of
the
car
and
twisted
on
the
wheel
until
it
seemed
that
his
muscles
must
crack
after
what
seemed
an
eon
of
waiting
he
ventured
another
look
ahead
the
rear
was
a
hundred
yards
in
front
of
him
now
and
from
the
wheels
of
the
caboose
an
odour
of
something
burning
drifted
up
to
him
i
got
your
wheels
locked
he
half
sobbed
i
hold
you
yet
you
brute
slide
that
it
slide
and
flatten
your
infernal
wheels
hah
you
quitting
quitting
i
have
you
in
control
before
we
reach
the
curve
burn
curse
you
burn
with
a
shriek
of
metal
scraping
metal
the
head
of
the
juggernaut
ahead
took
the
curve
clung
there
an
instant
and
was
catapulted
out
into
space
logs
weighing
twenty
tons
were
flung
about
like
kindling
one
instant
bryce
could
see
them
in
the
air
the
next
they
had
disappeared
down
the
hillside
a
deafening
crash
a
splash
a
cloud
of
dust
with
a
protesting
squeal
the
caboose
came
to
the
point
where
the
had
left
the
right
of
way
carrying
rails
and
ties
with
it
the
wheels
on
the
side
nearest
the
bank
slid
into
the
dirt
first
and
plowed
deep
into
the
soil
the
caboose
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
trembled
and
rattled
overtopped
its
centre
of
gravity
and
fell
over
against
the
wearily
like
a
drunken
hag
bryce
still
clinging
to
the
brake
was
fully
braced
for
the
shock
and
was
not
flung
off
calmly
he
descended
the
ladder
recovered
the
axe
from
the
bumper
climbed
back
to
the
roof
tiptoed
off
the
roof
to
the
top
of
the
bank
and
sat
calmly
down
under
a
manzanita
bush
to
await
results
for
he
was
quite
confident
that
none
of
the
occupants
of
the
confounded
caboose
had
been
treated
to
anything
worse
than
a
wild
ride
and
a
rare
fright
and
he
was
curious
to
see
how
shirley
sumner
would
behave
in
an
emergency
colonel
pennington
was
first
to
emerge
at
the
rear
of
the
caboose
he
leaped
lightly
down
the
steps
ran
to
the
front
of
the
car
looked
down
the
track
and
swore
feelingly
then
he
darted
back
to
the
rear
of
the
caboose
all
clear
and
snug
as
a
bug
under
a
chip
my
dear
he
called
to
shirley
thank
god
the
caboose
became
uncoupled
guess
that
fool
brakeman
forgot
to
drop
the
pin
it
was
the
last
car
and
when
it
jumped
the
track
and
plowed
into
the
dirt
it
just
naturally
quit
and
toppled
over
against
the
bank
come
out
my
shirley
came
out
but
white
and
trembling
the
colonel
placed
his
arm
around
her
and
she
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
shuddered
there
there
he
soothed
her
affectionately
it
all
over
my
dear
all
well
that
ends
the
train
she
cried
in
a
choking
voice
where
is
it
in
little
pieces
down
in
mad
he
laughed
happily
and
the
logs
were
even
mine
as
for
the
trucks
they
were
a
lot
of
ratty
antiques
and
only
fit
to
haul
cardigan
logs
about
a
hundred
yards
of
roadbed
ruined
that
the
extent
of
my
loss
for
i
charged
off
the
trucks
to
profit
and
loss
two
years
bryce
cardigan
she
sobbed
i
saw
him
he
was
riding
a
top
log
on
the
train
he
ah
god
help
him
the
colonel
shook
her
with
sudden
ferocity
young
cardigan
he
cried
sharply
riding
the
logs
are
you
certain
she
nodded
and
her
shoulders
shook
piteously
then
bryce
cardigan
is
gone
pennington
pronouncement
was
solemn
deadly
with
its
flat
finality
no
man
could
have
rolled
down
into
mad
river
with
a
trainload
of
logs
and
survived
the
devil
himself
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
added
well
that
clears
the
atmosphere
considerably
although
for
all
his
faults
i
regret
for
his
father
sake
that
this
dreadful
affair
has
happened
well
it
ca
be
helped
shirley
do
cry
my
dear
i
know
it
terrible
but
there
there
my
love
do
brace
up
poor
devil
for
all
his
damnable
treatment
of
me
i
would
have
had
this
happen
for
a
million
shirley
burst
into
wild
weeping
bryce
heart
leaped
for
he
understood
the
reason
for
her
grief
she
had
sent
him
away
in
anger
and
he
had
gone
to
his
death
ergo
it
would
be
long
before
shirley
would
forgive
herself
bryce
had
not
intended
presenting
himself
before
her
in
his
battered
and
bloody
condition
but
the
sight
of
her
distress
now
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
coughed
slightly
and
the
alert
colonel
glanced
up
at
him
instantly
well
i
be
hanged
the
words
fell
from
pennington
lips
with
a
heartiness
that
was
almost
touching
i
thought
you
gone
with
the
sorry
to
have
disappointed
you
old
top
bryce
replied
blithely
but
i
just
naturally
stubborn
too
bad
about
the
atmosphere
you
thought
cleared
a
moment
ago
it
clogged
worse
than
ever
at
the
sound
of
bryce
voice
shirley
raised
her
head
whirled
and
looked
up
at
him
he
held
his
handkerchief
over
his
gory
face
that
the
sight
might
not
distress
her
he
could
have
whooped
with
delight
at
the
joy
that
flashed
through
her
wet
lids
bryce
cardigan
she
commanded
sternly
come
down
here
this
i
not
a
pretty
sight
shirley
better
let
me
go
about
my
she
stamped
her
foot
come
here
well
since
you
insist
he
replied
and
he
slid
down
the
bank
how
did
you
get
up
there
and
what
do
you
mean
by
hiding
there
spying
on
me
you
you
oh
you
cuss
a
little
if
it
will
help
any
he
suggested
i
had
to
get
out
of
your
way
out
of
your
sight
and
up
there
was
the
best
place
i
was
on
the
roof
of
the
caboose
when
it
toppled
over
so
all
i
had
to
do
was
step
ashore
and
sit
then
why
did
you
stay
there
she
demanded
furiously
you
would
let
me
he
answered
demurely
and
when
i
saw
you
weeping
because
i
was
supposed
to
be
with
the
angels
i
could
help
coughing
to
let
you
know
i
was
still
hanging
around
ornery
as
a
how
did
you
ruin
your
face
cardigan
tried
to
take
a
cast
of
the
front
end
of
the
caboose
in
my
classic
countenance
that
but
you
were
riding
the
top
log
on
the
last
truck
certainly
but
i
was
hayseed
enough
to
stay
there
until
we
struck
this
curve
i
knew
exactly
what
was
going
to
happen
so
i
climbed
down
to
the
bumper
of
the
caboose
uncoupled
it
from
the
truck
climbed
up
on
the
roof
and
managed
to
get
the
old
thing
under
control
with
the
then
i
skedaddled
up
into
the
brush
because
i
knew
you
were
inside
and
the
way
colonel
pennington
here
is
your
axe
which
i
borrowed
this
afternoon
much
obliged
for
its
use
the
last
is
probably
waiting
on
the
siding
at
freshwater
to
pass
the
late
lamented
consequently
a
walk
of
about
a
mile
will
bring
you
a
means
of
transportation
back
to
sequoia
walk
leisurely
you
have
lots
of
time
as
for
myself
i
in
a
hurry
and
my
room
is
more
greatly
to
be
desired
than
my
company
so
i
start
he
lifted
his
hat
turned
and
walked
briskly
down
the
ruined
track
shirley
made
a
little
gesture
of
dissent
half
opened
her
lips
to
call
him
back
thought
better
of
it
and
let
him
go
when
he
was
out
of
sight
it
dawned
on
her
that
he
had
risked
his
life
to
save
hers
uncle
seth
she
said
soberly
what
would
have
happened
to
us
if
bryce
cardigan
had
not
come
up
here
to
thrash
your
we
both
be
in
kingdom
come
now
he
answered
truthfully
under
the
circumstances
then
shirley
continued
suppose
we
all
agree
to
forget
that
anything
unusual
happened
i
bear
the
young
man
no
ill
will
shirley
but
before
you
permit
yourself
to
be
carried
away
by
the
splendour
of
his
action
in
cutting
out
the
caboose
and
getting
it
under
control
it
might
be
well
to
remember
that
his
own
precious
hide
was
at
stake
also
he
would
have
cut
the
caboose
out
even
if
you
and
i
had
not
been
in
no
he
would
not
she
insisted
for
the
thought
that
he
had
done
it
for
her
sake
was
very
sweet
to
her
and
would
persist
cooped
up
in
the
caboose
we
did
not
know
the
train
was
running
away
until
it
was
too
late
for
us
to
jump
while
bryce
cardigan
riding
out
on
the
logs
must
have
known
it
almost
immediately
he
would
have
had
time
to
jump
before
the
runaway
gathered
too
much
headway
and
he
would
have
jumped
uncle
seth
for
his
father
well
he
certainly
did
stay
for
mine
she
dried
her
moist
eyes
and
blushed
furiously
uncle
seth
she
pleaded
taking
him
lovingly
by
the
arm
let
be
friends
with
bryce
cardigan
let
get
together
and
agree
on
an
equitable
contract
for
freighting
his
logs
over
our
you
are
now
he
replied
severely
mixing
sentiment
and
business
if
you
persist
the
result
will
be
chaos
cardigan
has
in
a
large
measure
squared
himself
for
his
ruffianly
conduct
earlier
in
the
day
and
forgive
him
and
treat
him
with
courtesy
hereafter
but
i
want
you
to
understand
shirley
that
such
treatment
by
me
does
not
constitute
a
license
for
that
fellow
to
crawl
up
in
my
lap
and
be
petted
he
is
practically
a
pauper
now
which
makes
him
a
poor
business
risk
and
you
please
me
greatly
by
leaving
him
severely
alone
by
making
him
keep
his
i
not
do
that
she
answered
with
a
quiet
finality
that
caused
her
uncle
to
favour
her
with
a
quick
searching
glance
he
need
not
have
worried
however
for
bryce
cardigan
was
too
well
aware
of
his
own
financial
condition
to
risk
the
humiliation
of
asking
shirley
sumner
to
share
it
with
him
moreover
he
had
embarked
upon
a
war
a
war
which
he
meant
to
fight
to
a
finish
chapter

george
sea
otter
summoned
by
telephone
came
out
to
freshwater
the
station
nearest
the
wreck
and
transported
his
battered
young
master
back
to
sequoia
here
bryce
sought
the
doctor
in
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
little
hospital
and
had
his
wrecked
nose
reorganized
and
his
cuts
bandaged
it
was
characteristic
of
his
father
son
that
when
this
detail
had
been
attended
to
he
should
go
to
the
office
and
work
until
the
six
whistle
blew
old
cardigan
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
gate
when
he
reached
home
george
sea
otter
had
already
given
the
old
man
a
more
or
less
garbled
account
of
the
runaway
and
cardigan
eagerly
awaited
his
arrival
in
order
to
ascertain
the
details
of
this
new
disaster
which
had
come
upon
them
for
disaster
it
was
in
truth
the
loss
of
the
logs
was
trifling
perhaps
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
the
destruction
of
the
was
the
crowning
misfortune
both
cardigans
knew
that
pennington
would
eagerly
seize
upon
this
point
to
stint
his
competitor
still
further
on
that
there
would
be
delays
purposeful
but
apparently
unavoidable
before
this
lost
would
be
replaced
and
in
the
interim
the
cardigan
mill
unable
to
get
a
sufficient
supply
of
logs
to
fill
orders
in
hand
would
be
forced
to
close
down
full
well
pennington
knew
that
anything
which
tends
to
bring
about
a
shortage
of
raw
material
for
any
manufacturing
plant
will
result
inevitably
in
the
loss
of
customers
well
son
said
john
cardigan
mildly
as
bryce
unlatched
the
gate
another
bump
eh
yes
sir
right
on
the
i
meant
another
bump
to
your
heritage
my
i
worrying
more
about
my
nose
partner
in
fact
i
not
worrying
about
my
heritage
at
all
i
come
to
a
decision
on
that
point
going
to
fight
and
fight
to
the
last
we
going
down
fighting
and
by
the
way
i
started
the
fight
this
afternoon
i
whaled
the
wadding
out
of
that
bucko
of
pennington
and
as
a
special
compliment
to
you
john
cardigan
i
did
an
almighty
fine
job
of
cleaning
even
went
so
far
as
to
muss
the
colonel
up
a
wow
wow
bryce
bully
for
you
i
wanted
that
man
rondeau
taken
apart
he
has
terrorized
our
for
a
long
time
he
king
of
the
you
bryce
was
relieved
his
father
did
not
know
then
of
the
act
of
vandalism
in
the
valley
of
the
giants
this
fact
strengthened
resolve
not
to
tell
him
also
to
get
the
fallen
monarch
sawed
up
and
the
stump
blasted
out
before
an
operation
should
restore
his
father
sight
and
reveal
to
him
the
crowning
cruelty
of
his
enemy
arm
in
arm
they
walked
up
the
garden
path
together
just
as
they
entered
the
house
the
telephone
in
the
hall
tinkled
and
bryce
answered
mr
cardigan
came
shirley
sumner
voice
over
the
wire
bryce
he
corrected
her
she
ignored
the
correction
i
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
she
faltered
there
is
no
necessity
for
saying
anything
but
you
saved
our
lives
and
at
least
have
a
right
to
expect
due
and
grateful
acknowledgment
of
our
debt
i
rang
up
to
tell
you
how
splendid
and
heroic
your
action
was
i
had
my
own
life
to
save
you
did
not
think
of
that
at
the
well
i
did
think
of
your
uncle
either
he
replied
without
enthusiasm
i
sure
we
never
can
hope
to
catch
even
with
you
do
try
your
revered
relative
will
not
so
why
should
you
you
are
making
it
somewhat
hard
for
me
to
to
rehabilitate
our
friendship
cardigan
we
have
just
passed
through
a
most
extraordinary
day
and
if
at
evening
i
can
feel
as
i
do
now
i
think
you
ought
to
do
your
share
and
bless
your
heart
he
murmured
the
very
fact
that
you
bothered
to
ring
me
up
at
all
makes
me
your
debtor
shirley
can
you
stand
some
plain
speaking
between
friends
i
mean
i
think
so
well
then
said
bryce
listen
to
this
i
am
your
uncle
enemy
until
death
do
us
part
neither
he
nor
i
expect
to
ask
or
to
give
quarter
and
i
going
to
smash
him
if
i
if
you
do
you
smash
me
she
warned
him
likewise
our
friendship
i
sorry
but
it
got
to
be
done
if
i
can
do
it
shall
shall
we
say
shirley
there
was
a
break
in
her
voice
mr
cardigan
i
wanted
you
to
well
that
cutting
the
mustard
he
murmured
sotto
voce
and
there
goes
another
bright
unknown
to
himself
he
spoke
directly
into
the
transmitter
and
shirley
clinging
half
hopefully
to
the
receiver
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
heard
him
caught
every
inflection
of
the
words
commonplace
enough
but
freighted
with
the
pathos
of
bryce
first
real
tragedy
oh
bryce
she
cried
sharply
but
he
did
not
hear
her
he
had
hung
up
his
receiver
now
the
week
that
ensued
was
remarkable
for
the
amount
of
work
bryce
accomplished
in
the
investigation
of
his
father
affairs
also
for
a
visit
from
donald
mctavish
the
bryce
found
him
sitting
in
the
private
office
one
morning
at
seven
hello
mctavish
he
saluted
the
cheerfully
and
extended
his
hand
for
a
cordial
greeting
his
wayward
employee
stood
up
took
the
proffered
hand
in
both
of
his
huge
and
callous
ones
and
held
it
rather
childishly
weel
is
the
wee
laddie
hissel
he
boomed
i
glad
to
see
ye
you
have
seen
me
the
day
before
yesterday
if
you
had
been
seeable
bryce
reminded
him
with
a
bright
smile
mac
old
man
they
tell
me
you
gotten
to
be
a
regular
i
nae
deny
i
take
a
wee
drappie
now
an
then
the
admitted
frankly
albeit
there
was
a
harried
hangdog
look
in
his
eyes
bryce
sat
down
at
his
desk
lighted
his
pipe
and
looked
mctavish
over
soberly
the
was
a
big
scotsman
with
a
plentiful
sprinkling
of
silver
in
his
thick
mane
of
red
hair
which
fell
far
down
on
his
shoulders
a
tremendous
nose
rose
majestically
out
of
a
face
so
strong
and
rugged
one
searched
in
vain
for
aught
of
manly
beauty
in
it
his
long
arms
hung
almost
to
his
knees
and
he
was
slightly
stooped
as
if
from
bearing
heavy
burdens
though
in
the
late
fifties
his
years
had
touched
him
lightly
but
john
barleycorn
had
not
been
so
considerate
bryce
noted
that
mctavish
was
carrying
some
thirty
pounds
of
whiskey
fat
and
that
the
pupils
of
his
fierce
blue
eyes
were
permanently
distended
showing
that
alcohol
had
begun
to
affect
his
brain
his
hands
trembled
as
he
stood
before
bryce
smiling
fatuously
and
plucking
at
the
cuffs
of
his
mackinaw
the
latter
realized
that
mctavish
was
waiting
for
him
to
broach
the
object
of
the
visit
so
with
an
effort
he
decided
to
begin
the
disagreeable
task
mac
did
moira
give
you
my
message
well
i
guess
we
understand
each
other
mac
was
there
something
else

wanted
to
see
me
about
mctavish
sidled
up
to
the
desk
ye
no
be
firin
auld
mac
oot

he
pleaded
hopefully
mon
ha
ye
the
heart
to
do
it
after
these
years
bryce
nodded
if
you
have
the
heart
after
all
these
years
to
draw
pay
you
do
not
earn
then
i
have
the
heart
to
put
a
better
man

arguing

meals
at
the
camp
kitchen

clothing
and
tobacco
that
i
send
out
to
you
neither
more
nor
less
he
reached
into
his
desk
and
drew
forth
a
check
here

wages
to
the
fifteenth
it
the
last
cardigan
check
you

i
terribly
sorry
but

deepened
to
a
growl

old

the
cardigans
they
never

met
the
youthful
master
for
several
seconds
then
the
trembled
and
his
gaze
sought
the
office
floor
bryce
knew
he
had
his
man
whipped
at
last
and
mctavish
realized
it
too
for
quite
suddenly
he

he
roared
furiously
and
left
the
office
bryce
called
after
him
a
cheerful
but
he
did
not
answer
and
he
did
not
remain
in
town
neither
did
he
return
to
his
shanty
in
the
woods
for
a
month
his
whereabouts

then
one
day
moira
received
a
letter
from
him
informing
her
that
he
had
a
job
in
a
shingle
mill
in
mendocino
county
chapter
xix
in
the
interim
bryce
had
not
been
idle
from
his
he
picked
an
old
experienced
hand
one
jabez
curtis
to
take
the
place
of
the
vanished
mctavish
colonel
pennington
having
repaired
in
three
days
the
gap
in
his
railroad
wrote
a
letter
to
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
informing
bryce
that
until
more
equipment
could
be
purchased
and
delivered
to
take
the
place
of
the
destroyed
in
the
wreck
the
latter
would
have
to
be
content
with
whereupon
bryce
irritated
the
colonel
profoundly
by
purchasing
a
lot
of
trucks
from
a
bankrupt
mill
in
lassen
county
and
delivering
them
to
the
colonel
road
via
the
deck
of
a
steam
schooner
that
will
insure
delivery
of
sufficient
logs
to
get
out
our
orders
on
file
bryce
informed
his
father
while
we
are
morally
certain
our
mill
will
run
but
one
year
longer
i
intend
that
it
shall
run
full
capacity
for
that
year
in
fact
i
going
to
saw
in
that
one
year
remaining
to
us
as
much
lumber
as
we
would
ordinarily
saw
in
two
years
to
be
exact
i
going
to
run
a
the
sightless
old
man
raised
both
hands
in
deprecation
the
market
wo
absorb
it
he
protested
then
we
stack
it
in
piles
to
and
wait
until
the
market
is
brisk
enough
to
absorb
it
bryce
replied
our
finances
wo
stand
the
overhead
of
that
i
tell
you
his
father
warned
i
know
we
have
sufficient
cash
on
hand
to
attempt
it
dad
but
going
to
borrow
from
whom
no
bank
in
sequoia
will
lend
us
a
penny
and
long
before
you
came
home
i
had
sounded
every
possible
source
of
a
private
did
you
sound
the
sequoia
bank
of
commerce
certainly
not
pennington
owns
the
controlling
interest
in
that
bank
and
i
was
never
a
man
to
waste
my
bryce
chuckled
i
do
care
where
the
money
comes
from
so
long
as
i
get
it
partner
pennington
money
may
be
tainted
in
fact
i
risk
a
bet
that
it
is
but
our
employees
will
accept
it
for
wages
nevertheless
desperate
circumstances
require
desperate
measures
you
know
and
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
colonel
pennington
controls
the
sequoia
bank
of
commerce
i
drifted
in
on
the
president
and
casually
struck
him
for
a
loan
of
one
hundred
thousand
well
i
be
shot
bryce
what
did
he
say
said
he
take
the
matter
under
consideration
and
give
me
an
answer
this
morning
he
asked
me
of
course
what
i
wanted
that
much
money
for
and
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
run
a
double
my
force
of
men
in
the
woods
and
buy
some
more
which
i
can
get
rather
cheap
well
this
morning
i
called
for
my
answer
and
got
it
the
sequoia
bank
of
commerce
will
loan
me
up
to
a
hundred
thousand
but
it
wo
give
me
the
cash
in
a
lump
sum
i
can
have
enough
to
buy
the
now
and
on
the
first
of
each
month
when
i
present
my
the
bank
will
advance
me
the
money
to
meet
bryce
i
am
i
am
not
since
you
tell
me
colonel
pennington
controls
that
bank
that
the
bank
should
accommodate
us
is
the
most
natural
procedure
imaginable
pennington
is
only
playing
safe
which
is
why
the
bank
declined
to
give
me
the
money
in
a
lump
sum
if
we
run
a
pennington
knows
that
we
ca
dispose
of
our
excess
output
under
present
market
conditions
the
redwood
trade
is
in
the
doldrums
and
will
remain
in
them
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
until
the
principal
redwood
centres
secure
a
rail
outlet
to
the
markets
of
the
country
it
a
safe
bet
our
lumber
is
going
to
pile
up
on
the
mill
dock
hence
when
the
smash
comes
and
the
sequoia
bank
of
commerce
calls
our
loan
and
we
can
not
possibly
meet
it
the
lumber
on
hand
will
prove
security
for
the
loan
will
it
not
in
fact
it
will
be
worth
two
or
three
dollars
per
thousand
more
then
than
it
is
now
because
it
will
be
and
inasmuch
as
all
the
signs
point
to
pennington
gobbling
us
anyhow
it
strikes
me
as
a
rather
good
business
on
his
part
to
give
us
sufficient
rope
to
insure
a
thorough
job
of
but
what
idea
have
you
got
back
of
such
a
procedure
bryce
merely
a
forlorn
hope
dad
something
might
turn
up
the
market
may
take
a
sudden
spurt
and
go
up
three
or
four
yes
and
it
may
take
a
sudden
spurt
and
drop
three
or
four
dollars
his
father
reminded
him
bryce
laughed
that
would
be
pennington
funeral
dad
and
whether
the
market
goes
up
or
comes
down
it
costs
us
nothing
to
make
the
quite
his
father
agreed
then
if
you
come
down
to
the
office
morning
dad
hold
a
meeting
of
our
board
of
directors
and
authorize
me
as
president
of
the
company
to
sign
the
note
to
the
bank
we
borrowing
this
without
collateral
you
john
cardigan
sighed
such
daring
financial
acrobatics
were
not
usual
with
him
but
as
bryce
had
remarked
there
was
no
reason
why
in
their
present
predicament
they
should
not
gamble
hence
he
entered
no
further
objection
and
the
following
day
the
agreement
was
entered
into
with
the
bank
bryce
closed
by
wire
for
the
extra
and
immediately
set
about
rounding
up
a
crew
for
the
woods
and
for
the
in
the
mill
for
a
month
bryce
was
as
busy
as
the
proverbial
with
the
itch
and
during
all
that
time
he
did
not
see
shirley
sumner
or
hear
of
her
directly
or
indirectly
only
at
infrequent
intervals
did
he
permit
himself
to
think
of
her
for
he
was
striving
to
forget
and
the
memory
of
his
brief
glimpse
of
paradise
was
always
provocative
of
pain
moira
mctavish
in
the
meantime
had
come
down
from
the
woods
and
entered
upon
her
duties
in
the
mill
office
the
change
from
her
dull
drab
life
giving
her
as
it
did
an
opportunity
for
companionship
with
people
of
greater
mentality
and
refinement
than
she
had
been
used
to
quickly
brought
about
a
swift
transition
in
the
girl
nature
with
the
passing
of
the
coarse
shoes
and
calico
dresses
and
the
substitution
of
the
kind
of
clothing
all
women
of
moira
instinctive
refinement
and
natural
beauty
long
for
the
girl
became
cheerful
animated
and
imbued
with
the
optimism
of
her
years
at
first
old
sinclair
resented
the
advent
of
a
woman
in
the
office
then
he
discovered
that
moira
efforts
lightened
his
own
labours
in
exact
proportion
to
the
knowledge
of
the
business
which
she
assimilated
from
day
to
day
moira
worked
in
the
general
office
and
except
upon
occasions
when
bryce
desired
to
look
at
the
books
or
moira
brought
some
document
into
the
private
office
for
his
perusal
there
were
days
during
which
his
pleasant
good
morning
moira
constituted
the
extent
of
their
conversation
to
john
cardigan
however
moira
was
a
ministering
angel
gradually
she
relieved
bryce
of
the
care
of
the
old
man
she
made
a
cushion
for
his
in
the
office
she
read
the
papers
to
him
and
the
correspondence
and
discussed
with
him
the
receipt
and
delivery
of
orders
the
movements
of
the
the
comedies
and
tragedies
of
his
people
which
had
become
to
him
matters
of
the
utmost
importance
she
brushed
his
hair
dusted
his
hat
and
crowned
him
with
it
when
he
left
the
office
at
nightfall
and
whenever
bryce
was
absent
in
the
woods
or
in
san
francisco
it
fell
to
her
lot
to
lead
the
old
man
to
and
from
the
house
on
the
hill
to
his
starved
heart
her
sweet
womanly
attentions
were
tremendously
welcome
and
gradually
he
formed
the
habit
of
speaking
of
her
half
tenderly
half
jokingly
as
my
bryce
had
been
absent
in
san
francisco
for
ten
days
he
had
planned
to
stay
three
weeks
but
finding
his
business
consummated
in
less
time
he
returned
to
sequoia
unexpectedly
moira
was
standing
at
the
tall
bookkeeping
desk
her
beautiful
dark
head
bent
over
the
ledger
when
he
entered
the
office
and
set
his
suitcase
in
the
corner
is
that
you
bryce
she
queried
the
identical
individual
moira
how
did
you
guess
it
was
i
she
looked
up
at
him
then
and
her
wonderful
dark
eyes
lighted
with
a
flame
bryce
had
not
seen
in
them
heretofore
i
knew
you
were
coming
she
replied
simply
but
how
could
you
know
i
did
telegraph
because
i
wanted
to
surprise
my
father
and
the
instant
the
boat
touched
the
dock
i
went
overside
and
came
directly
here
i
did
even
wait
for
the
crew
to
run
out
the
gangplank
so
i
know
nobody
could
have
told
you
i
was
that
is
quite
right
bryce
nobody
told
me
you
were
coming
but
i
just
knew
when
i
heard
the
noyo
whistling
as
she
made
the
dock
that
you
were
aboard
and
i
did
look
up
when
you
entered
the
office
because
i
wanted
to
verify
my
my
you
had
a
hunch
moira
do
you
get
those
telepathic
messages
very
often
he
was
crossing
the
office
to
shake
her
hand
i
never
noticed
particularly
that
is
until
i
came
to
work
here
but
i
always
know
when
you
are
returning
after
a
considerable
she
gave
him
her
hand
i
so
glad
you
why
he
demanded
bluntly
she
flushed
i
i
really
do
know
well
then
he
persisted
what
do
you
think
makes
you
glad
i
had
been
thinking
how
nice
it
would
be
to
have
you
back
bryce
when
you
enter
the
office
it
like
a
breeze
rustling
the
tops
of
the
redwoods
and
your
father
misses
you
so
he
talks
to
me
a
great
deal
about
you
why
of
course
we
miss
you
anybody
as
he
held
her
hand
he
glanced
down
at
it
and
noted
how
greatly
it
had
changed
during
the
past
few
months
the
skin
was
no
longer
rough
and
brown
and
the
fingers
formerly
stiff
and
swollen
from
hard
work
were
growing
more
shapely
from
her
hand
his
glance
roved
over
the
girl
noting
the
improvements
in
her
dress
and
the
way
the
thick
wavy
black
hair
was
piled
on
top
of
her
shapely
head
it
had
occurred
to
me
before
moira
he
said
with
a
bright
impersonal
smile
that
robbed
his
remark
of
all
suggestion
of
masculine
flattery
but
it
seems
to
me
i
unusually
glad
to
see
you
also
you
been
fixing
your
hair
the
soft
lambent
glow
leaped
again
into
moira
eyes
he
had
noticed
her
particularly
do
you
like
my
hair
done
that
way
she
inquired
eagerly
i
do
know
whether
i
do
or
not
it
unusual
for
you
you
look
mighty
sweetly
with
it
coiled
in
back
somewhat
like
an
daguerreotype
of
my
mother
is
this
new
style
the
latest
in
hairdressing
in
sequoia
i
think
so
bryce
i
copied
it
from
colonel
pennington
niece
miss
oh
he
replied
briefly
you
met
her
have
you
i
did
know
she
was
in
sequoia
she
been
away
but
she
came
back
last
week
i
went
to
the
valley
of
the
giants
last
saturday
afternoon
bryce
interrupted
you
did
tell
my
father
about
the
tree
that
was
cut
did
you
he
demanded
sharply
good
girl
he
must
know
go
on
moira
i
interrupted
i
met
miss
sumner
up
there
she
was
lost
she
followed
the
old
trail
into
the
timber
and
when
the
trees
shut
out
the
sun
she
lost
all
sense
of
direction
she
was
terribly
frightened
and
crying
when
i
found
her
and
brought
her
well
i
swan
moira
what
was
she
doing
in
our
timber
she
told
me
that
once
when
she
was
a
little
girl
you
had
taken
her
for
a
ride
on
your
pony
up
to
your
mother
grave
and
it
seems
she
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
that
spot
again
and
started
out
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
poor
dear
she
was
in
a
sad
state
when
i
found
how
fortunate
you
found
her
i
met
miss
sumner
three
or
four
times
that
was
when
she
first
came
to
sequoia
she
a
stunning
girl
she
perfectly
bryce
she
the
first
lady
i
ever
met
no
doubt
her
kind
are
not
a
product
of
homely
little
communities
like
sequoia
and
for
that
matter
neither
is
her
wolf
of
an
uncle
what
did
miss
sumner
have
to
say
to
you
moira
she
told
me
all
about
herself
and
she
said
a
lot
of
nice
things
about
you
bryce
after
i
told
her
i
worked
for
you
and
when
i
showed
her
the
way
home
she
insisted
that
i
should
walk
home
with
her
so
i
did
and
the
butler
served
us
with
tea
and
toast
and
marmalade
then
she
showed
me
all
her
wonderful
things
and
gave
me
some
of
them
oh
bryce
she
so
sweet
she
had
her
maid
dress
my
hair
in
half
a
dozen
different
styles
until
they
could
decide
on
the
right
style
and
and
that
it
eh
moira
she
nodded
brightly
i
can
see
that
you
and
miss
sumner
evidently
hit
it
off
just
right
with
each
other
are
you
going
to
call
on
her
again
oh
yes
she
begged
me
to
she
says
she
i
dare
say
she
is
moira
well
her
choice
of
a
pal
is
a
tribute
to
the
brains
i
suspected
her
of
possessing
and
i
glad
you
gotten
to
know
each
other
i
no
doubt
you
find
life
a
little
lonely
sometimes
how
my
father
splendid
i
taken
good
care
of
him
for
moira
you
a
sweetheart
of
a
girl
i
do
know
how
we
ever
managed
to
wiggle
along
without
fraternally
almost
paternally
he
gave
her
radiant
cheek
three
light
little
pats
as
he
strode
past
her
to
the
private
office
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
his
desk
upon
which
he
could
see
through
the
open
door
a
pile
of
letters
and
orders
and
a
moment
later
he
was
deep
in
a
perusal
of
them
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
ever
and
anon
the
girl
turned
upon
him
her
brooding
glance
that
night
bryce
and
his
father
as
was
their
custom
after
dinner
repaired
to
the
library
where
the
bustling
and
motherly
tully
served
their
coffee
this
good
soul
after
the
democratic
fashion
in
vogue
in
many
western
communities
had
never
been
regarded
as
a
servant
neither
did
she
so
regard
herself
she
was
john
cardigan
housekeeper
and
as
such
she
had
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
served
father
and
son
their
meals
and
then
seated
herself
at
the
table
with
them
this
arrangement
had
but
one
drawback
although
this
did
not
present
itself
until
after
bryce
return
to
sequoia
and
his
assumption
of
the
direction
of
the
cardigan
destinies
for
tully
had
a
failing
common
to
many
of
her
sex
she
possessed
for
other
people
business
an
interest
absolutely
incapable
of
satisfaction
and
she
was
in
addition
garrulous
beyond
belief
the
library
was
the
one
spot
in
the
house
which
at
the
beginning
of
her
employment
john
cardigan
had
indicated
to
tully
as
sanctuary
for
him
and
his
hence
having
served
the
coffee
this
evening
the
amiable
creature
withdrew
although
not
without
a
pang
as
she
reflected
upon
the
probable
nature
of
their
conversation
and
the
void
which
must
inevitably
result
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
her
advice
and
friendly
cooperation
and
sympathy
no
sooner
had
tully
departed
than
bryce
rose
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
john
cardigan
opened
the
conversation
with
a
contented
grunt
plug
the
keyhole
son
he
continued
i
believe
you
have
something
on
your
mind
and
you
know
how
tully
resents
the
closing
of
that
door
estimable
soul
that
she
is
i
have
known
her
to
eavesdrop
she
help
it
poor
thing
she
was
born
that
bryce
clipped
a
cigar
and
held
a
lighted
match
while
his
father
smoked
then
he
slipped
into
the
beside
the
old
man
well
john
cardigan
he
began
eagerly
fate
ripped
a
big
hole
in
our
dark
cloud
the
other
day
and
showed
me
some
of
the
silver
lining
been
making
bad
medicine
for
colonel
pennington
partner
the
pill
rolling
for
that
scheming
scoundrel
will
surely
nauseate
him
when
he
swallows
what
in
the
wind
boy
we
going
to
parallel
pennington
inasmuch
as
that
will
cost
close
to
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
i
of
the
opinion
that
we
not
going
to
do
anything
of
the
perhaps
nevertheless
if
i
can
demonstrate
to
a
certain
party
that
it
will
not
cost
more
than
three
quarters
of
a
million
he
loan
me
the
the
old
man
shook
his
head
i
do
believe
it
bryce
who
the
crazy
man
his
name
is
gregory
he
now
i
know
he
crazy
when
he
hands
you
the
money
you
find
talking
real
money
but
thinking
of
confederate
greenbacks
for
a
sane
scotchman
to
loan
that
much
money
without
collateral
security
would
be
equivalent
to
exposing
his
spinal
cord
and
tickling
it
with
a
bryce
laughed
pal
he
declared
if
you
and
i
have
any
brains
they
must
roll
around
in
our
skulls
like
buckshot
in
a
tin
pan
here
been
sitting
for
three
months
and
twiddling
our
thumbs
or
lying
awake
nights
trying
to
scheme
a
way
out
of
our
difficulties
when
if
we
had
the
sense
that
god
gives
geese
we
would
have
solved
the
problem
long
ago
and
ceased
worrying
listen
now
with
all
your
ears
when
bill
henderson
wanted
to
build
the
logging
railroad
which
he
afterward
sold
to
pennington
and
which
pennington
is
now
using
as
a
club
to
beat
our
brains
out
did
he
have
the
money
to
build
it
where
did
he
get
it
i
loaned
it
to
him
he
only
had
about
eight
miles
of
road
to
build
then
so
i
could
afford
to
accommodate
how
did
he
pay
you
back
why
he
gave
me
a
contract
for
hauling
our
logs
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
thousand
feet
and
i
merely
credited
his
account
with
the
amount
of
the
he
sent
me
until
he
squared
up
the
loan
principal
and
well
if
bill
henderson
financed
himself
on
that
plan
why
we
think
of
using
the
same
plan
for
financing
a
road
to
parallel
pennington
john
cardigan
sat
up
with
a
jerk
by
thunder
he
murmured
that
was
as
close
as
he
ever
came
to
uttering
an
oath
by
thunder
he
repeated
i
never
thought
of
that
but
then
he
added
i
not
so
young
as
i
used
to
be
and
there
are
any
number
of
ideas
which
would
have
occurred
to
me
twenty
years
ago
but
do
not
occur
to
me
all
right
john
cardigan
i
forgive
you
now
then
continue
to
listen
to
the
north
of
that
great
block
of
timber
held
by
you
and
pennington
lie
the
redwood
holdings
of
the
trinidad
redwood
timber
never
heard
of
them
well
timber
away
in
there
in
back
of
beyond
has
never
been
well
advertised
because
it
is
regarded
as
practically
inaccessible
by
extending
his
and
adding
to
his
pennington
could
make
it
accessible
but
he
will
not
he
figures
on
buying
all
that
back
timber
rather
cheap
when
he
gets
around
to
it
for
the
reason
that
the
trinidad
redwood
timber
company
can
not
possibly
mill
its
timber
until
a
railroad
connects
its
holdings
with
the
outside
world
they
can
hold
it
until
their
corporation
franchise
expires
and
it
will
not
increase
sufficiently
in
value
to
pay
i
wonder
why
the
blamed
fools
ever
bought
in
there
when
they
bought
it
looked
like
a
good
buy
you
will
remember
that
some
ten
years
ago
a
company
was
incorporated
with
the
idea
of
building
a
railroad
from
grant
pass
oregon
on
the
line
of
the
southern
pacific
down
the
oregon
and
california
coast
to
tap
the
redwood
i
remember
there
was
a
big
whoop
and
hurrah
and
then
the
proposition
died
abornin
the
engineers
found
that
the
cost
of
construction
through
that
mountainous
country
was
well
before
the
project
died
gregory
and
his
associates
believed
that
it
was
going
to
survive
they
decided
to
climb
in
on
the
ground
floor
had
some
advance
inside
information
that
the
road
was
to
be
built
go
they
quietly
gathered
together
thirty
thousand
acres
of
good
stuff
and
then
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
railroad
and
they
are
still
waiting
gregory
by
the
way
is
the
president
of
the
trinidad
redwood
timber
company
he
an
edinburgh
man
and
the
fly
american
promoters
got
him
to
put
up
the
price
of
the
timber
and
then
mortgaged
their
interests
to
him
as
security
for
the
advance
he
foreclosed
on
their
notes
five
years
and
there
he
is
with
his
useless
timber
john
cardigan
murmured
thoughtfully
the
poor
scotch
sucker
he
is
poor
the
purchase
of
that
timber
did
even
dent
his
he
what
they
call
in
england
a
manufacturer
purveyor
to
his
majesty
the
king
and
all
that
but
he
would
like
to
sell
his
timber
and
being
scotch
naturally
he
desires
to
sell
it
at
a
profit
in
order
to
create
a
market
for
it
however
he
has
to
have
an
outlet
to
that
market
we
supply
the
outlet
with
his
help
and
what
happens
why
timber
that
cost
him
fifty
and
cents
per
thousand
feet
stumpage
and
the
actual
timber
will
overrun
the
cruiser
estimate
every
time
will
be
worth
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
perhaps
the
elder
cardigan
turned
slowly
in
his
chair
and
bent
his
sightless
gaze
upon
his
son
well
well
he
cried
impatiently
he
loans
us
the
money
to
build
our
road
we
build
it
on
through
our
timber
and
into
his
the
collateral
security
which
we
put
up
will
be
a
contract
to
haul
his
logs
to
tidewater
on
humboldt
bay
at
a
base
of
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
with
an
increase
of
cents
per
thousand
every
five
years
thereafter
and
an
option
for
a
renewal
of
the
contract
upon
expiration
at
the
rate
of
freight
last
paid
we
also
grant
him
perpetual
for
his
logs
in
the
slough
which
we
own
and
where
we
now
store
our
logs
until
needed
at
the
mill
in
addition
we
sell
him
at
a
reasonable
figure
sufficient
land
fronting
on
tidewater
to
enable
him
to
erect
a
sawmill
lay
out
his
yards
and
build
a
dock
out
into
the
deep
water
thus
gregory
will
have
that
which
he
has
got
now
an
outlet
to
his
market
by
water
and
when
the
railroad
to
sequoia
builds
in
from
the
south
it
will
connect
with
the
road
which
we
have
built
from
sequoia
up
into
township
nine
to
the
north
hence
gregory
will
also
have
an
outlet
to
his
market
by
rail
he
can
easily
get
a
good
manager
to
run
his
lumber
business
until
he
finds
a
customer
for
it
and
in
the
meantime
we
will
be
charging
his
account
with
our
against
him
and
gradually
pay
off
the
loan
without
pinching
have
you
talked
with
gregory
yes
i
met
him
while
i
was
in
san
francisco
somebody
brought
him
up
to
a
meeting
of
the
redwood
lumber
manufacturers
association
and
i
pounced
on
him
like
an
owl
on
a
john
cardigan
old
hand
came
gropingly
forth
and
rested
affectionately
upon
his
boy
what
a
wonderful
scheme
it
would
have
been
a
year
ago
he
murmured
sadly
you
forget
my
son
that
we
can
not
last
in
business
long
enough
to
get
that
road
built
though
gregory
should
agree
to
finance
the
building
of
it
the
interest
on
our
bonded
indebtedness
is
payable
on
the
first
we
can
meet
it
aye
but
we
ca
meet
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
which
under
the
terms
of
our
deed
of
trust
we
are
required
to
pay
in
on
july
first
of
each
year
as
a
sinking
fund
toward
the
retirement
of
our
bonds
by
efforts
by
sacrificing
a
dozen
cargoes
raising
hob
with
the
market
and
getting
ourselves
disliked
by
our
neighbours
we
managed
to
meet
half
of
it
this
year
and
procure
an
extension
of
six
months
on
the
balance
due
that
is
pennington
way
he
plays
with
us
as
a
cat
does
with
a
mouse
knowing
like
the
cat
that
when
he
is
weary
of
playing
he
will
devour
us
and
now
when
we
are
deeper
in
debt
than
ever
when
the
market
is
lower
and
more
sluggish
than
it
has
been
in
fifteen
years
to
hope
to
meet
the
interest
and
the
next
payment
to
the
sinking
fund
taxes
my
optimism
bryce
it
just
ca
be
done
we
have
our
road
about
half
completed
when
we
bust
up
in
business
indeed
the
minute
pennington
suspected
we
were
paralleling
his
line
he
choke
off
our
wind
i
tell
you
it
ca
be
but
bryce
contradicted
him
earnestly
it
can
be
done
he
said
gregory
knows
nothing
of
our
financial
condition
our
rating
in
the
reports
of
the
commercial
agencies
is
as
good
as
it
ever
was
and
a
man
never
broke
till
somebody
finds
it
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
if
we
can
start
building
our
road
and
have
it
half
completed
before
pennington
jumps
on
us
gregory
will
simply
have
to
come
to
our
aid
in
once
he
ties
up
with
us
he
committed
to
the
task
of
seeing
us
through
if
we
fall
he
must
pick
us
up
and
carry
us
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
and
i
will
so
arrange
the
deal
that
he
will
have
to
i
can
do
it
i
tell
john
cardigan
raised
his
hand
no
he
said
firmly
i
will
not
allow
you
to
do
this
that
way
that
is
the
pennington
method
if
we
fall
my
son
we
pass
out
like
gentlemen
not
blackguards
we
will
not
take
advantage
of
this
man
gregory
faith
if
he
joins
forces
with
us
we
lay
our
hand
on
the
table
and
let
him
then
he
never
join
hands
with
us
partner
we
we
not
done
my
son
we
have
one
alternative
and
i
going
to
take
it
i
got
to
for
your
sake
moreover
your
mother
would
have
wished
it
you
do
mean
yes
i
do
i
going
to
sell
pennington
my
valley
of
the
giants
thank
god
that
does
not
belong
to
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
it
is
my
personal
property
and
it
is
not
mortgaged
pennington
can
never
foreclose
on
it
and
until
he
gets
it
hundred
acres
of
virgin
timber
on
squaw
creek
are
valueless
nay
a
source
of
expense
to
him
bryce
he
has
to
have
it
and
he
pay
the
price
when
he
knows
i
mean
with
a
sweeping
gesture
he
waved
aside
the
arguments
that
rose
to
his
son
lips
lead
me
to
the
telephone
he
commanded
and
bryce
recognizing
his
sire
unalterable
determination
obeyed
find
pennington
number
in
the
john
cardigan
commanded
next
bryce
found
it
and
his
father
proceeded
to
get
the
colonel
on
the
wire
pennington
he
said
hoarsely
this
is
john
cardigan
speaking
decided
to
sell
you
that
that
blocks
your
timber
on
squaw
indeed
the
colonel
purred
i
had
an
idea
you
were
going
to
present
it
to
the
city
for
a
natural
i
changed
my
mind
i
decided
to
sell
at
your
last
i
changed
my
mind
too
i
decided
not
to
buy
at
my
last
offer
slowly
john
cardigan
hung
the
receiver
on
the
hook
turned
and
groped
for
his
son
when
he
found
him
the
old
man
held
him
for
a
moment
in
his
arms
lead
me
upstairs
son
he
murmured
presently
i
tired
going
to
when
colonel
seth
pennington
turned
from
the
telephone
and
faced
his
niece
shirley
read
his
triumph
in
his
face
old
cardigan
has
capitulated
at
last
he
cried
exultingly
we
played
a
waiting
game
and
i
won
he
just
telephoned
to
say
he
accept
my
last
offer
for
his
valley
of
the
giants
as
the
sentimental
old
fool
calls
that
of
huge
redwoods
that
blocks
the
outlet
to
our
squaw
creek
but
you
not
going
to
buy
it
you
told
him
so
uncle
of
course
i
not
going
to
buy
it
at
my
last
offer
it
worth
five
thousand
dollars
in
the
open
market
and
once
i
offered
him
fifty
thousand
for
it
now
i
give
him
i
wonder
why
he
wants
to
sell
shirley
mused
from
what
bryce
cardigan
told
me
once
his
father
attaches
a
sentimental
value
to
that
strip
of
woods
his
wife
is
buried
there
it
or
rather
it
used
to
be
a
sort
of
shrine
to
the
old
he
selling
it
because
he
desperate
if
he
was
teetering
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
he
never
let
me
outgame
him
pennington
replied
gayly
i
say
this
for
the
old
fellow
he
no
bluffer
however
since
i
know
his
financial
condition
almost
to
a
dollar
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
good
business
to
buy
his
valley
of
the
giants
now
wait
until
he
has
gone
bust
and
save
or
thirty
thousand
i
think
you
biting
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
face
uncle
seth
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
needs
that
outlet
in
dollars
and
cents
what
is
it
worth
to
the
company
if
i
thought
i
could
get
it
from
cardigan
a
few
months
from
now
go
as
high
as
a
hundred
thousand
for
it
he
answered
coolly
in
that
event
i
advise
you
to
take
it
for
fifty
thousand
terribly
hard
on
old
cardigan
to
have
to
sell
it
even
at
that
you
do
not
understand
these
matters
shirley
do
try
and
waste
your
sympathy
on
that
old
humbug
he
has
to
dig
up
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
pay
on
his
bonded
indebtedness
and
he
finding
it
a
difficult
job
he
just
sparring
for
time
but
he
lose
as
if
to
indicate
that
he
considered
the
matter
closed
the
colonel
drew
his
chair
toward
the
fire
picked
up
a
magazine
and
commenced
idly
to
slit
the
pages
shirley
studied
the
back
of
his
head
for
some
time
then
got
out
some
fancy
work
and
commenced
plying
her
needle
and
as
she
plied
it
a
thought
nebulous
at
first
gradually
took
form
in
her
head
until
eventually
she
murmured
loud
enough
for
the
colonel
to
hear
i
do
do
what
pennington
queried
something
nice
for
somebody
who
did
something
nice
for
me
she
answered
that
mctavish
girl
he
suggested
poor
moira
is
she
sweet
uncle
seth
i
going
to
give
her
that
black
suit
of
mine
i
scarcely
worn
it
i
thought
so
he
interrupted
with
an
indulgent
yawn
well
do
whatever
makes
for
your
happiness
my
dear
that
all
money
is
about
two
the
following
afternoon
old
judge
moore
of
the
superior
court
of
humboldt
county
drifted
into
bryce
cardigan
office
sat
down
uninvited
and
lifted
his
long
legs
to
the
top
of
an
adjacent
chair
well
bryce
my
boy
he
began
a
little
bird
tells
me
your
daddy
is
considering
the
sale
of
cardigan
redwoods
or
the
valley
of
the
giants
as
your
paternal
ancestor
prefers
to
refer
to
that
little
old
out
yonder
on
the
edge
of
town
how
about
it
bryce
stared
at
him
a
moment
questioningly
yes
judge
he
replied
we
sell
if
we
get
our
well
his
visitor
drawled
i
have
a
client
who
might
be
persuaded
i
here
to
talk
turkey
what
your
price
before
we
talk
price
bryce
parried
i
want
you
to
answer
a
let
her
fly
said
judge
moore
are
you
directly
or
indirectly
acting
for
colonel
pennington
that
none
of
your
business
young
man
at
least
it
would
be
none
of
your
business
if
i
were
directly
or
indirectly
acting
for
that
unconvicted
thief
to
the
best
of
my
information
and
belief
colonel
pennington
does
figure
in
this
deal
in
any
way
shape
or
manner
and
as
you
know
i
been
your
daddy
friend
for
thirty
still
bryce
was
not
convinced
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
would
have
staked
his
honour
on
the
judge
veracity
nobody
knew
better
than
he
in
what
devious
ways
the
colonel
worked
his
wonders
to
perform
well
he
said
your
query
is
rather
sudden
judge
but
still
i
can
name
you
a
price
i
will
state
frankly
however
that
i
believe
it
to
be
over
your
head
we
have
several
times
refused
to
sell
to
colonel
pennington
for
a
hundred
thousand
naturally
that
little
dab
of
timber
is
worth
more
to
pennington
than
to
anybody
else
however
my
client
has
given
me
instructions
to
go
as
high
as
a
hundred
thousand
if
necessary
to
get
the
what
i
said
it
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
the
present
standard
weight
and
judge
moore
last
statement
swept
away
bryce
suspicions
he
required
now
no
further
evidence
that
regardless
of
the
identity
of
the
client
that
client
could
not
possibly
be
colonel
seth
pennington
or
any
one
acting
for
him
since
only
the
night
before
pennington
had
curtly
refused
to
buy
the
property
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
a
moment
bryce
stared
stupidly
at
his
visitor
then
he
recovered
his
wits
sold
he
almost
shouted
and
after
the
fashion
of
the
west
extended
his
hand
to
clinch
the
bargain
the
judge
shook
it
solemnly
the
lord
loveth
a
quick
trader
he
declared
and
reached
into
the
capacious
breast
pocket
of
his
prince
albert
coat
here
the
deed
already
made
out
in
favour
of
myself
as
he
winked
knowingly
client
a
bit
modest
i
take
it
bryce
suggested
oh
very
of
course
i
only
hazarding
a
guess
but
that
guess
is
that
my
client
can
afford
the
gamble
and
is
figuring
on
giving
pennington
a
pain
where
he
never
knew
it
to
ache
him
before
in
plain
english
i
believe
the
colonel
is
in
for
a
razooing
at
the
hands
of
somebody
with
a
small
grouch
against
may
the
lord
strengthen
that
somebody
arm
bryce
breathed
fervently
if
your
client
can
afford
to
hold
out
long
enough
he
be
able
to
buy
pennington
squaw
creek
timber
at
a
my
understanding
is
that
such
is
the
bryce
reached
for
the
deed
then
reached
for
his
hat
if
you
be
good
enough
to
wait
here
judge
moore
i
run
up
to
the
house
and
get
my
father
to
sign
this
deed
the
valley
of
the
giants
is
his
personal
property
you
know
he
did
include
it
in
his
assets
when
incorporating
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
returned
with
the
deed
duly
signed
by
john
cardigan
and
witnessed
by
bryce
whereupon
the
judge
carelessly
tossed
his
certified
check
for
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
on
bryce
desk
and
departed
whistling
turkey
in
the
bryce
reached
for
the
telephone
and
called
up
colonel
pennington
bryce
cardigan
speaking
he
began
but
the
colonel
cut
him
short
my
dear
impulsive
young
friend
he
interrupted
in
oleaginous
tones
how
often
do
you
have
to
be
told
that
i
am
not
quite
ready
to
buy
that
oh
bryce
retorted
i
merely
called
up
to
tell
you
that
every
dollar
and
every
asset
you
have
in
the
world
including
your
heart
blood
is
sufficient
to
buy
the
valley
of
the
giants
from
us
eh
what
that
why
because
my
dear
overcautious
and
thoroughly
unprincipled
enemy
it
was
sold
five
minutes
ago
for
the
tidy
sum
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
if
you
do
believe
me
come
over
to
my
office
and
let
you
feast
your
eyes
on
the
certified
he
could
hear
a
distinct
gasp
after
an
interval
of
five
seconds
however
the
colonel
recovered
his
poise
i
congratulate
you
he
purred
i
suppose
i
have
to
wait
a
little
longer
now
wo
i
well
patience
is
my
middle
name
au
the
colonel
hung
up
his
hard
face
was
ashen
with
rage
and
he
stared
at
a
calendar
on
the
wall
with
his
cold
phidian
stare
however
he
was
not
without
a
generous
stock
of
optimism
somebody
has
learned
of
the
low
state
of
the
cardigan
fortune
he
mused
and
taken
advantage
of
it
to
induce
the
old
man
to
sell
at
last
they
figuring
on
selling
to
me
at
a
neat
profit
and
i
certainly
did
overplay
my
hand
last
night
however
there
nothing
to
do
now
except
sit
tight
and
wait
for
the
new
next
meanwhile
in
the
general
office
of
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
joy
was
rampant
bryce
cardigan
was
doing
a
buck
and
wing
dance
around
the
room
while
moira
mctavish
with
her
back
to
her
tall
desk
watched
him
in
her
eyes
a
tremendous
joy
and
a
sweet
yearning
glow
of
adoration
that
bryce
was
too
happy
and
excited
to
notice
suddenly
he
paused
before
her
moira
you
a
lucky
girl
he
declared
i
thought
this
morning
you
were
going
back
to
a
kitchen
in
a
it
almost
broke
my
heart
to
think
of
fate
swindling
you
like
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
gave
her
a
brotherly
hug
it
autumn
in
the
woods
moira
and
all
the
underbrush
is
she
smiled
though
it
was
winter
in
her
heart
chapter
xx
not
the
least
of
the
traits
which
formed
shirley
sumner
character
was
pride
proud
people
quite
usually
are
fiercely
independent
and
meticulously
honest
and
shirley
pride
was
monumental
hers
was
the
pride
of
lineage
of
womanhood
of
an
assured
station
in
life
combined
with
that
other
pride
which
is
rather
difficult
of
definition
without
verbosity
and
is
perhaps
better
expressed
in
the
terse
and
illuminating
phrase
a
unlike
her
precious
relative
unlike
the
majority
of
her
sex
shirley
had
a
wonderfully
balanced
sense
of
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
her
code
of
honour
resembled
that
of
a
very
gallant
gentleman
she
could
love
well
and
hate
well
a
careful
analysis
of
shirley
feelings
toward
bryce
cardigan
immediately
following
the
incident
in
pennington
woods
had
showed
her
that
under
more
propitious
circumstances
she
might
have
fallen
in
love
with
that
tempestuous
young
man
in
sheer
recognition
of
the
many
lovable
and
manly
qualities
she
had
discerned
in
him
as
an
offset
to
the
credit
side
of
bryce
account
with
her
however
there
appeared
certain
debits
in
the
consideration
of
which
shirley
always
lost
her
temper
and
was
immediately
quite
certain
she
loathed
the
unfortunate
man
he
had
been
an
honoured
and
for
aught
shirley
knew
to
the
contrary
welcome
guest
in
the
penninton
home
one
night
and
the
following
day
had
assaulted
his
host
committed
great
bodily
injuries
upon
the
employees
for
little
or
no
reason
save
the
satisfaction
of
an
abominable
temper
made
threats
of
further
violence
declared
his
unfaltering
enmity
to
her
nearest
and
relative
and
in
the
next
breath
had
had
the
insolence
to
prate
of
his
respect
and
admiration
for
her
indeed
in
cogitating
on
this
latter
incongruity
shirley
recalled
that
the
extraordinary
fellow
had
been
forced
rather
abruptly
to
check
himself
in
order
to
avoid
a
fervid
declaration
of
love
and
all
of
this
under
the
protection
of
a
axe
one
eye
on
her
and
the
other
on
his
enemies
however
all
of
these
grave
crimes
and
misdemeanors
were
really
insignificant
compared
with
his
crowning
offense
what
had
infuriated
shirley
was
the
fact
that
she
had
been
at
some
pains
to
inform
bryce
cardigan
that
she
loathed
him
whereat
he
had
looked
her
over
coolly
grinned
a
little
and
declined
to
believe
her
then
seemingly
as
if
fate
had
decreed
that
her
futility
should
be
impressed
upon
her
still
further
bryce
cardigan
had
been
granted
an
opportunity
to
save
in
a
strikingly
calm
heroic
and
painful
manner
her
and
her
uncle
from
certain
and
horrible
death
thus
placing
upon
shirley
an
obligation
that
was
as
irritating
to
acknowledge
as
it
was
futile
to
attempt
to
reciprocate
that
was
where
the
shoe
pinched
before
that
day
was
over
she
had
been
forced
to
do
one
of
two
things
acknowledge
in
no
uncertain
terms
her
indebtedness
to
him
or
remain
silent
and
be
convicted
of
having
been
in
plain
language
a
rotter
so
she
had
telephoned
him
and
purposely
left
ajar
the
door
to
their
former
friendly
relations
monstrous
he
had
seen
the
open
door
and
deliberately
slammed
it
in
her
face
luckily
for
them
both
she
had
heard
all
unsuspected
by
him
as
he
slowly
hung
the
receiver
on
the
hook
the
soliloquy
wherein
he
gave
her
a
pointed
hint
of
the
distress
with
which
he
abdicated
which
knowledge
was
all
that
deterred
her
from
despising
him
with
the
fervour
of
a
woman
scorned
resolutely
shirley
set
herself
to
the
task
of
forgetting
bryce
when
after
the
passage
of
a
few
weeks
she
realized
that
he
was
quite
sincere
in
his
determination
to
forget
her
frequent
glimpses
of
him
on
the
streets
of
sequoia
the
occasional
mention
of
his
name
in
the
sequoia
sentinel
the
very
whistle
of
cardigan
mill
made
her
task
a
difficult
one
and
presently
in
desperation
she
packed
up
and
departed
for
an
indefinite
stay
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
however
she
discovered
that
absence
had
had
the
traditional
effect
upon
her
heart
and
found
herself
possessed
of
a
great
curiosity
to
study
the
villain
at
short
range
and
discover
if
possible
what
new
rascality
he
might
be
meditating
about
this
time
a
providential
attack
of
that
aristocratic
ailment
gout
having
laid
colonel
pennington
low
she
told
herself
her
duty
lay
in
sequoia
that
she
had
shirley
sumner
in
hand
at
last
and
that
the
danger
was
over
in
consequence
she
returned
to
sequoia
the
fascination
which
a
lighted
candle
holds
for
a
moth
is
too
well
known
to
require
further
elucidation
here
in
yielding
one
day
to
a
desire
to
visit
the
valley
of
the
giants
shirley
told
herself
that
she
was
going
there
to
gather
wild
blackberries
she
had
been
thinking
of
a
certain
blackberry
pie
which
thought
naturally
induced
reflection
on
bryce
cardigan
and
reminded
shirley
of
her
first
visit
to
the
giants
under
the
escort
of
a
boy
in
knickerbockers
she
had
a
very
vivid
remembrance
of
that
little
amphitheatre
with
the
sunbeams
falling
like
a
halo
on
the
plain
tombstone
she
wondered
if
the
years
had
changed
it
all
and
decided
that
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
harm
in
indulging
a
very
natural
curiosity
to
visit
and
investigate
her
meeting
with
moira
mctavish
that
day
and
the
subsequent
friendship
formed
with
the
daughter
renewed
all
her
old
apprehensions
on
the
assumption
that
shirley
and
bryce
were
practically
strangers
to
each
other
an
assumption
which
shirley
for
obvious
reasons
did
not
attempt
to
dissipate
moira
did
not
hesitate
to
mention
bryce
very
frequently
to
her
he
was
the
one
human
being
in
the
world
utterly
worth
while
and
it
is
natural
for
women
to
discuss
frequently
and
at
great
length
the
subject
nearest
their
hearts
in
the
three
stock
subjects
of
the
admirable
sex
man
dress
and
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
man
readily
holds
the
ascendancy
and
by
degrees
moira
discovering
that
shirley
having
all
the
dresses
she
required
several
dozen
more
in
fact
and
being
neither
subnormal
mentally
nor
fragile
physically
gave
the
last
two
topics
scant
attention
formed
the
habit
of
expatiating
at
great
length
on
the
latter
moira
described
bryce
in
minute
detail
and
related
to
her
eager
auditor
little
unconscious
daily
acts
of
kindness
thoughtfulness
or
humour
performed
by
bryce
his
devotion
to
his
father
his
idealistic
attitude
toward
the
cardigan
employees
his
ability
his
industry
the
wonderful
care
he
bestowed
upon
his
fingernails
his
marvellous
taste
in
neckwear
the
boyishness
of
his
lighter
and
the
mannishness
of
his
serious
moments
and
presently
little
by
little
shirley
resentment
against
him
faded
and
in
her
heart
was
born
a
great
wistfulness
bred
of
the
hope
that
some
day
she
would
meet
bryce
cardigan
on
the
street
and
that
he
would
pause
lift
his
hat
smile
at
her
his
compelling
smile
and
forthwith
proceed
to
bully
her
into
being
friendly
and
forgiving
browbeat
her
into
admitting
her
change
of
heart
and
glorying
in
it
to
this
remarkable
state
of
mind
had
shirley
sumner
attained
at
the
time
old
john
cardigan
leading
his
last
little
trump
in
a
vain
hope
that
it
would
enable
him
to
take
the
odd
trick
in
the
huge
game
he
had
played
for
fifty
years
decided
to
sell
his
valley
of
the
giants
shortly
after
joining
her
uncle
in
sequoia
shirley
had
learned
from
the
colonel
the
history
of
old
man
cardigan
and
his
valley
of
the
giants
or
as
the
townspeople
called
it
cardigan
redwoods
therefore
she
was
familiar
with
its
importance
to
the
assets
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
since
while
that
remained
the
property
of
john
cardigan
two
thousand
five
hundred
acres
of
splendid
timber
owned
by
the
former
were
rendered
inaccessible
her
uncle
had
explained
to
her
that
ultimately
this
would
mean
the
tying
up
of
some
two
million
dollars
and
inasmuch
as
the
colonel
never
figured
less
than
five
per
cent
return
on
anything
he
was
in
this
instance
facing
a
net
loss
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
each
year
obstinate
john
cardigan
persisted
in
retaining
that
i
gladly
give
him
a
hundred
thousand
for
that
miserable
little
dab
of
timber
and
let
him
keep
a
couple
of
acres
surrounding
his
wife
grave
if
the
old
fool
would
only
listen
to
reason
the
colonel
had
complained
bitterly
to
her
i
offered
him
that
price
a
score
of
times
and
he
tells
me
blandly
the
property
is
for
sale
well
he
who
laughs
last
laughs
best
and
if
i
ca
get
that
by
paying
more
than
ten
times
what
it
worth
in
the
open
market
i
get
it
some
other
way
if
it
costs
me
a
how
shirley
had
queried
at
the
time
never
mind
my
dear
he
had
answered
darkly
you
would
understand
the
procedure
if
i
told
you
i
have
to
run
all
around
robin
barn
and
put
up
a
deal
of
money
one
way
or
another
but
in
the
end
i
get
it
all
back
with
interest
and
cardigan
redwoods
the
old
man
ca
last
forever
and
what
with
his
fool
methods
of
doing
business
he
about
broke
anyhow
i
expect
to
do
business
with
his
executor
or
his
receiver
within
a
shirley
as
explained
in
a
preceding
chapter
had
been
present
the
night
john
cardigan
desperate
and
brought
to
bay
at
last
had
telephoned
pennington
at
the
latter
home
accepting
pennington
last
offer
for
the
valley
of
the
giants
the
cruel
triumph
in
the
colonel
handsome
face
as
he
curtly
rebuffed
old
cardigan
had
been
too
apparent
for
the
girl
to
mistake
recalling
her
conversation
with
him
anent
the
impending
possibility
of
his
doing
business
with
john
cardigan
receiver
or
executor
she
realized
now
that
a
crisis
had
come
in
the
affairs
of
the
cardigans
and
across
her
vision
there
flashed
again
the
vision
of
bryce
cardigan
homecoming
of
a
tall
old
man
with
his
trembling
arms
clasped
around
his
boy
with
grizzled
cheek
laid
against
his
son
as
one
who
seeking
comfort
through
bitter
years
at
length
had
found
it
presently
another
thought
came
to
shirley
she
knew
bryce
cardigan
was
far
from
being
indifferent
to
her
she
had
given
him
his
opportunity
to
be
friendly
with
her
again
and
he
had
chosen
to
ignore
her
though
sorely
against
his
will
for
weeks
shirley
had
pondered
this
mysterious
action
and
now
she
thought
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
reason
underlying
it
all
in
sequoia
bryce
cardigan
was
regarded
as
the
heir
to
the
throne
of
humboldt
first
but
shirley
knew
now
that
as
a
bryce
cardigan
bade
fair
to
wear
a
tinsel
crown
was
it
this
knowledge
that
had
led
him
to
avoid
her
i
wonder
she
mused
he
proud
perhaps
the
realization
that
he
will
soon
be
penniless
and
shorn
of
his
high
estate
has
made
him
chary
of
acquiring
new
friends
in
his
old
circle
perhaps
if
he
were
secure
in
his
business
affairs
ah
yes
poor
boy
he
was
desperate
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
her
heart
swelled
oh
bryce
bryce
she
murmured
i
think
i
beginning
to
understand
some
of
your
fury
that
day
in
the
woods
it
all
a
great
mystery
but
i
sure
you
did
intend
to
be
so
so
terrible
oh
my
dear
if
we
had
only
continued
to
be
the
good
friends
we
started
out
to
be
perhaps
you
let
me
help
you
now
for
what
good
is
money
if
one
can
not
help
one
dear
friends
in
distress
still
i
know
you
would
let
me
help
you
for
men
of
your
stamp
can
not
borrow
from
a
woman
no
matter
how
desperate
their
need
and
yet
you
only
need
a
paltry
fifty
thousand
dollars
shirley
carried
to
bed
with
her
that
night
the
woes
of
the
cardigans
and
in
the
morning
she
telephoned
moira
mctavish
and
invited
the
latter
to
lunch
with
her
at
home
that
noon
it
was
in
her
mind
to
question
moira
with
a
view
to
acquiring
additional
information
when
moira
came
shirley
saw
that
she
had
been
weeping
my
poor
moira
she
said
putting
her
arms
around
her
visitor
what
has
happened
to
distress
you
has
your
father
come
back
to
sequoia
forgive
me
for
asking
you
never
mentioned
him
but
i
have
heard
there
there
dear
tell
me
all
about
moira
laid
her
head
on
shirley
shoulder
and
sobbed
for
several
minutes
then
it
bryce
she
wailed
he
so
unhappy
something
happened
they
going
to
sell
cardigan
redwoods
and
they
do
want
to
old
cardigan
is
home
ill
and
just
before
i
left
the
office
bryce
came
in
and
stood
a
moment
looking
at
me
so
tragically
i
i
asked
him
what
had
happened
then
he
patted
my
cheek
oh
i
know
i
just
one
of
his
responsibilities
and
said
moira
never
any
luck
and
went
into
his
private
office
i
waited
a
little
and
then
i
went
in
too
and
oh
miss
sumner
he
had
his
head
down
on
his
desk
and
when
i
touched
his
head
he
reached
up
and
took
my
hand
and
held
it
and
laid
his
cheek
against
it
a
little
while
and
oh
his
cheek
was
wet
it
cruel
of
god
to
make
him
unhappy
good
too
good
and
oh
i
love
him
so
miss
shirley
i
love
him
so
and
he
never
never
know
i
just
one
of
his
responsibilities
you
know
and
i
should
presume
but
nobody
has
ever
been
kind
to
me
but
bryce
and
you
and
i
ca
help
loving
people
who
are
kind
and
gentle
to
the
hysterical
outburst
over
shirley
led
the
girl
to
her
cozy
upstairs
and
prevailed
upon
the
girl
to
put
on
one
of
her
own
beautiful
negligees
moira
story
her
confession
of
love
so
tragic
because
so
hopeless
had
stirred
shirley
deeply
she
seated
herself
in
front
of
moira
and
cupped
her
chin
in
her
palm
of
course
dear
she
said
you
could
possibly
see
anybody
you
loved
suffer
so
and
not
feel
dreadfully
about
it
and
when
a
man
like
bryce
cardigan
is
struck
down
he
apt
to
present
rather
a
tragic
and
helpless
figure
he
wanted
sympathy
moira
woman
sympathy
and
it
was
dear
of
you
to
give
it
to
i
gladly
die
for
him
moira
answered
simply
oh
miss
shirley
you
do
know
him
the
way
we
who
work
for
him
do
if
you
did
you
love
him
too
you
could
help
it
miss
perhaps
he
loves
you
too
the
words
came
with
difficulty
moira
shook
her
head
hopelessly
no
miss
shirley
i
only
one
of
his
many
human
problems
and
he
just
wo
go
back
on
me
for
old
sake
we
played
together
ten
years
ago
when
he
used
to
spend
his
vacations
at
our
house
in
cardigan
woods
when
my
father
was
he
bryce
cardigan
and
i
i
used
to
work
in
the
kitchen
of
his
never
mind
moira
he
may
love
you
even
though
you
do
not
suspect
it
you
must
be
so
despairing
providence
has
a
way
of
working
out
these
things
tell
me
about
his
trouble
i
think
it
money
he
been
terribly
worried
for
a
long
time
and
afraid
things
are
going
right
with
the
business
i
felt
ever
since
i
been
there
that
there
something
that
puts
a
cloud
over
bryce
smile
it
hurts
them
terribly
to
have
to
sell
the
valley
of
the
giants
but
they
have
to
colonel
pennington
is
the
only
one
who
would
consider
buying
it
they
do
want
him
to
have
it
and
still
they
have
to
sell
to
i
happen
to
know
moira
that
he
is
going
to
buy
yes
he
is
but
not
at
a
price
that
will
do
them
any
good
they
have
always
thought
he
would
be
eager
to
buy
whenever
they
decided
to
sell
and
now
he
says
he
does
want
it
and
old
cardigan
is
ill
over
it
all
bryce
says
his
father
has
lost
his
courage
at
last
and
oh
dear
things
are
in
such
a
mess
bryce
started
to
tell
me
all
about
it
and
then
he
stopped
suddenly
and
would
say
another
shirley
smiled
she
thought
she
understood
the
reason
for
that
however
she
did
not
pause
to
speculate
on
it
since
the
crying
need
of
the
present
was
the
distribution
of
a
ray
of
sunshine
to
moira
silly
she
chided
how
needlessly
you
are
grieving
you
say
my
uncle
has
declined
to
buy
the
valley
of
the
giants
moira
nodded
my
uncle
does
know
what
he
talking
about
moira
i
see
that
he
does
buy
it
what
price
are
the
cardigans
asking
for
it
now
well
colonel
pennington
has
offered
them
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
it
time
and
again
but
last
night
he
withdrew
that
offer
then
they
named
a
price
of
fifty
thousand
and
he
said
he
did
want
it
at
he
needs
it
and
it
worth
every
cent
of
a
hundred
thousand
to
him
moira
do
worry
dear
he
buy
it
because
i
make
him
and
buy
it
immediately
only
you
must
promise
me
not
to
mention
a
single
word
of
what
i
telling
you
to
bryce
cardigan
or
in
fact
to
anybody
do
you
promise
moira
seized
shirley
hand
and
kissed
it
impulsively
very
well
then
shirley
continued
that
matter
is
adjusted
and
now
we
all
be
happy
here
comes
thelma
with
luncheon
cheer
up
dear
and
remember
that
sometime
this
afternoon
you
going
to
see
bryce
smile
again
and
perhaps
there
wo
be
so
much
of
a
cloud
over
his
smile
this
when
moira
returned
to
the
office
of
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
shirley
rang
for
her
maid
bring
me
my
and
hat
thelma
she
ordered
and
telephone
for
the
she
seated
herself
before
the
mirror
at
her
and
dusted
her
adorable
nose
with
a
mr
smarty
cardigan
she
murmured
happily
you
walked
over
my
pride
did
you
placed
me
under
an
obligation
i
could
never
hope
to
meet
and
then
ignored
me
did
you
very
well
old
boy
we
all
have
our
innings
sooner
or
later
you
know
and
i
going
to
make
a
substantial
payment
on
that
huge
obligation
as
sure
as
my
name
is
shirley
sumner
then
some
day
when
the
sun
is
shining
for
you
again
you
come
to
me
and
be
very
very
humble
you
entirely
too
independent
cardigan
but
oh
my
dear
i
do
hope
you
will
not
need
so
much
money
i
be
put
to
my
wit
end
to
get
it
to
you
without
letting
you
know
because
if
your
affairs
go
to
smash
you
be
perfectly
intolerable
and
yet
you
deserve
it
you
such
an
idiot
for
not
loving
moira
she
an
angel
and
i
gravely
fear
i
just
an
interfering
mischievous
resentful
little
devil
seeking
vengeance
on
she
paused
suddenly
no
i
not
do
that
either
she
soliloquized
i
keep
it
myself
for
an
investment
i
show
uncle
seth
i
a
business
woman
after
all
he
has
had
his
fair
chance
at
the
valley
of
the
giants
after
waiting
years
for
it
and
now
he
has
deliberately
sacrificed
that
chance
to
be
mean
and
vindictive
i
afraid
uncle
seth
is
very
sporty
after
what
bryce
cardigan
did
for
us
that
day
the
ran
away
i
have
to
teach
him
not
to
hit
an
old
man
when
he
down
and
begging
for
mercy
buy
the
valley
but
keep
my
identity
secret
from
everybody
then
when
uncle
seth
finds
a
stranger
in
possession
he
have
a
fit
and
perhaps
before
he
recovers
sell
me
all
his
squaw
creek
timber
only
he
never
know
i
the
buyer
and
when
i
control
the
outlet
well
i
think
that
squaw
creek
timber
will
make
an
excellent
investment
if
it
held
for
a
few
years
shirley
my
dear
i
pleased
with
you
really
i
never
knew
until
now
why
men
could
be
so
devoted
to
business
wo
it
be
jolly
to
step
in
between
uncle
seth
and
bryce
cardigan
hold
up
my
hand
like
a
policeman
and
say
it
boys
no
fighting
if
you
please
and
if
anybody
wants
to
know
who
boss
around
here
start
something
and
shirley
laid
her
head
upon
the
and
laughed
heartily
she
had
suddenly
bethought
herself
of
aesop
fable
of
the
lion
and
the
mouse
when
her
uncle
came
home
that
night
shirley
observed
that
he
was
preoccupied
and
disinclined
to
conversation
i
noticed
in
this
evening
paper
she
remarked
presently
that
cardigan
has
sold
his
valley
of
the
giants
so
you
bought
it
after
all
no
such
luck
he
almost
barked
i
an
idiot
i
should
be
placed
in
charge
of
a
keeper
now
for
heaven
sake
shirley
do
discuss
that
timber
with
me
for
if
you
do
i
go
plain
lunatic
crazy
i
had
a
very
trying
poor
uncle
seth
she
purred
sweetly
her
apparent
sympathy
soothed
his
rasped
soul
he
continued
oh
i
get
the
infernal
property
and
it
will
be
worth
what
i
have
to
pay
for
it
only
it
certainly
does
gravel
me
to
realize
that
i
am
about
to
be
held
up
with
no
help
in
sight
i
see
judge
moore
and
offer
him
a
quick
profit
for
his
client
that
the
game
you
i
do
hope
the
new
owner
exhibits
some
common
sense
uncle
dear
she
replied
and
turned
back
to
the
piano
but
i
greatly
fear
she
added
to
herself
that
the
new
owner
is
going
to
prove
a
most
obstinate
creature
and
frightfully
hard
to
true
to
his
promise
the
colonel
called
on
judge
moore
bright
and
early
the
following
morning
act
three
of
that
little
business
drama
entitled
valley
of
the
giants
my
dear
judge
he
announced
pleasantly
i
play
the
lead
in
this
act
you
remember
me
i
hope
i
played
a
bit
in
act
in
so
far
as
my
information
goes
sir
you
been
cut
out
of
the
cast
in
act
three
i
do
seem
to
find
any
lines
for
you
to
one
line
judge
one
little
line
what
profit
does
your
client
want
on
that
that
is
not
in
the
market
colonel
when
it
is
send
for
you
since
you
the
only
logical
prospect
should
my
client
decide
to
sell
and
remembering
how
you
butted
in
on
politics
in
this
county
last
fall
and
provided
a
to
beat
me
and
place
a
crook
on
the
superior
court
bench
in
order
to
give
you
an
edge
in
the
many
suits
you
are
always
filing
or
having
filed
against
you
i
rise
to
remark
that
you
have
about
ten
split
seconds
in
which
to
disappear
from
my
office
if
you
linger
longer
i
start
throwing
and
as
if
to
emphasize
his
remark
the
judge
hand
closed
over
one
of
the
articles
in
question
the
colonel
withdrew
with
what
dignity
he
could
muster
chapter
xxi
upon
his
return
from
the
office
that
night
bryce
cardigan
found
his
father
had
left
his
bed
and
was
seated
before
the
library
fire
feeling
a
whole
lot
better
eh
pal
his
son
queried
john
cardigan
smiled
yes
son
he
replied
plaintively
i
guess
manage
to
live
till
next
oh
i
knew
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
you
john
cardigan
that
a
healthy
check
would
cure
pennington
rather
jolted
you
though
did
he
he
did
bryce
it
was
jolt
enough
to
be
forced
to
sell
that
quarter
i
never
expected
we
have
to
do
it
but
when
i
realize
that
it
was
a
case
of
sacrificing
you
or
my
giants
of
course
you
won
and
i
did
feel
so
badly
about
it
as
i
used
to
think
i
would
i
suppose
that
because
there
is
a
certain
morbid
pleasure
in
a
real
sacrifice
for
those
we
love
and
i
never
doubted
but
that
pennington
would
snap
up
the
property
the
instant
i
offered
to
sell
hence
his
refusal
in
the
face
of
our
desperate
need
for
money
to
carry
on
until
conditions
improve
almost
floored
your
old
well
we
can
afford
to
draw
our
breath
now
and
that
gives
us
a
fighting
chance
partner
and
right
after
dinner
you
and
i
will
sit
down
and
start
brewing
a
pot
of
powerful
bad
medicine
for
the
son
i
been
sitting
here
simmering
all
there
was
a
note
of
the
old
dominant
fighting
john
cardigan
in
his
voice
now
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
even
if
i
must
sit
on
the
bench
and
root
not
reached
the
point
where
my
years
have
begun
to
affect
my
thinking
he
touched
his
leonine
head
i
as
right
as
a
fox
upstairs
johnny
we
buck
the
line
together
after
dinner
you
trot
out
your
plan
of
campaign
and
i
trot
out
mine
then
we
tear
them
apart
select
the
best
pieces
of
each
and
weld
them
into
a
perfect
accordingly
dinner
disposed
of
father
and
son
sat
down
together
to
prepare
the
plan
of
campaign
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
a
silence
settled
between
them
the
while
they
puffed
meditatively
upon
their
cigars
then
the
old
man
spoke
we
have
to
fight
him
in
the
why
because
if
pennington
knows
or
even
suspects
the
identity
of
the
man
who
is
going
to
parallel
his
logging
railroad
he
will
throw
all
the
weight
of
his
truly
capable
mind
his
wealth
and
his
ruthlessness
against
you
and
you
will
be
smashed
to
beat
that
man
you
must
do
more
than
spend
money
you
will
have
to
outthink
him
outwork
him
outgame
him
and
when
eventually
you
have
won
you
know
you
been
in
the
fight
of
your
career
you
have
one
advantage
starting
out
the
colonel
does
think
you
have
the
courage
to
parallel
his
road
in
the
first
place
in
the
second
place
he
knows
you
have
the
money
and
in
the
third
place
he
is
morally
certain
you
can
not
borrow
it
because
you
have
any
collateral
to
secure
your
note
we
are
mortgaged
now
to
the
limit
and
our
floating
indebtedness
is
very
large
on
the
face
of
things
and
according
to
the
colonel
very
correct
inside
information
we
helpless
and
unless
the
stiffens
very
materially
this
year
by
the
time
our
with
pennington
road
expires
we
be
back
where
we
were
yesterday
before
we
sold
the
giants
pennington
regards
that
hundred
thousand
as
money
for
us
so
all
things
considered
the
colonel
will
be
slow
to
suspect
us
of
having
an
ace
in
the
hole
but
by
jinks
we
have
it
and
we
going
to
play
no
said
bryce
we
going
to
let
somebody
else
play
it
for
us
the
point
you
make
to
wit
that
we
must
remain
absolutely
in
the
background
is
well
very
well
agreed
the
old
man
now
let
us
proceed
to
the
next
point
you
must
engage
some
reliable
engineer
to
look
over
the
proposed
route
of
the
road
and
give
us
an
estimate
of
the
cost
of
for
the
sake
of
argument
we
will
consider
that
done
and
that
the
estimate
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
sum
gregory
is
willing
to
advance
your
third
step
then
will
be
to
incorporate
a
railroad
company
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
i
think
i
favour
the
fair
state
of
new
jersey
with
our
trade
bryce
suggested
dryly
i
notice
that
when
pennington
bought
out
the
henderson
interests
and
reorganized
that
property
he
incorporated
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
home
of
the
trusts
there
must
be
some
advantage
connected
with
such
a
have
it
your
own
way
boy
what
good
enough
for
the
colonel
is
good
enough
for
us
now
then
you
are
going
to
incorporate
a
company
to
build
a
road
twelve
miles
long
and
a
private
road
at
that
that
would
be
a
fatal
step
pennington
would
know
somebody
was
going
to
build
a
and
regardless
of
who
the
builders
were
he
would
have
to
fight
them
in
how
are
you
going
to
cover
your
trail
my
son
bryce
pondered
i
will
to
begin
have
a
dummy
board
of
directors
also
my
road
can
not
be
private
it
must
be
a
common
carrier
and
where
the
shoe
pinches
common
carriers
are
subject
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
railroad
they
are
wise
and
just
rules
commented
the
old
man
expensive
to
obey
at
times
but
quite
necessary
we
can
obey
and
still
be
happy
objection
well
then
since
we
must
be
a
common
carrier
we
might
as
well
carry
our
deception
still
further
and
incorporate
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
road
from
sequoia
to
grant
pass
oregon
there
to
connect
with
the
southern
john
cardigan
smiled
the
old
dream
revived
eh
well
the
old
jokes
always
bring
a
hearty
laugh
people
will
laugh
at
your
company
because
folks
up
this
way
realize
that
the
construction
cost
of
such
a
road
is
prohibitive
not
to
mention
the
cost
of
maintenance
which
would
be
tremendous
and
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
freight
area
well
since
we
not
going
to
build
more
than
twelve
miles
of
our
road
during
the
next
year
and
probably
not
more
than
ten
miles
additional
during
the
present
century
we
wo
worry
over
it
it
does
cost
a
cent
more
to
procure
a
franchise
to
build
a
road
from
here
to
the
moon
if
we
fail
to
build
to
grant
pass
our
franchise
to
build
the
uncompleted
portion
of
the
road
merely
lapses
and
we
hold
only
that
portion
which
we
have
constructed
that
all
we
want
to
how
about
rights
of
way
they
will
cost
us
very
little
if
anything
most
or
the
landowners
along
the
proposed
route
will
give
us
rights
of
way
free
gratis
and
for
nothing
just
to
encourage
the
lunatics
without
a
railroad
the
land
is
valueless
and
as
a
common
carrier
they
know
we
can
condemn
rights
of
way
capriciously
withheld
something
we
can
not
do
as
a
private
road
moreover
deeds
to
rights
of
way
can
be
drawn
with
a
after
which
they
revert
to
the
original
good
strategy
my
son
and
certainly
as
a
common
carrier
we
will
be
welcomed
by
the
farmers
and
cattlemen
along
our
short
line
we
can
handle
their
freight
without
much
annoyance
and
perhaps
at
a
slight
well
that
about
completes
the
rough
outline
of
our
plan
the
next
thing
to
do
is
to
start
and
keep
right
on
moving
for
as
old
omar
has
it
bird
of
time
hath
but
a
little
way
to
flutter
and
the
birdshot
is
catching
up
with
him
we
have
a
year
in
which
to
build
our
road
if
we
do
not
hurry
the
mill
will
have
to
shut
down
for
lack
of
logs
when
our
contract
with
pennington
you
forget
the
manager
for
our
new
corporation
the
and
general
manager
the
man
we
engage
must
be
the
fastest
and
most
convincing
talker
in
california
not
only
must
he
be
able
to
tell
a
lie
with
a
straight
face
but
he
must
be
able
to
believe
his
own
lies
and
he
must
talk
in
millions
look
millions
and
act
as
if
a
million
dollars
were
equivalent
in
value
to
a
redwood
stump
in
addition
he
must
be
a
man
of
real
ability
and
a
person
you
can
trust
i
have
the
very
man
you
mention
his
name
is
buck
ogilvy
and
only
this
very
day
i
received
a
letter
from
him
begging
me
for
a
small
loan
i
have
buck
on
ice
in
a
san
francisco
tell
me
about
him
do
have
to
you
just
told
me
about
him
however
i
read
you
his
letter
i
claim
there
is
more
character
in
a
letter
than
in
a
here
bryce
read
aloud
golden
gate
hotel
rooms
fifty
cents
and
up
san
francisco
california
august
fifteenth
my
dear
cardigan
hark
to
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
then
picture
to
yourself
the
unlovely
spectacle
of
a
strong
man
crying
let
us
assume
that
you
have
duly
considered
now
wind
up
your
wrist
and
send
me
a
rectangular
piece
of
white
blue
green
or
pink
paper
bearing
in
the
lower
corner
in
your
clear
bold
chirography
the
magic
words
bryce
cardigan
with
the
little
hook
and
flourish
which
identifies
your
signature
given
in
your
serious
moods
and
lends
value
to
otherwise
worthless
paper
five
dollars
would
make
me
chirk
up
ten
would
start
a
slight
smile
twenty
would
put
a
beam
in
mine
eye
fifty
would
cause
me
to
utter
shrill
cries
of
unadulterated
joys
and
a
hundred
would
inspire
me
to
actions
like
unto
those
of
a
whirling
dervish
i
am
so
flat
busted
my
arches
make
hollow
sounds
as
i
tread
the
hard
pavements
of
a
great
city
seeking
a
job
pausing
on
the
brink
of
despair
that
destiny
which
shapes
our
ends
inspired
me
to
think
of
old
times
and
happier
days
and
particularly
of
that
midget
of
a
girl
who
tended
the
just
back
of
the
railroad
station
at
princeton
you
stole
that
damsel
from
me
and
i
never
thanked
you
then
i
remembered
you
were
a
with
a
kind
heart
and
that
you
lived
somewhere
in
california
so
i
looked
in
the
telephone
book
and
found
the
address
of
the
san
francisco
office
of
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
you
have
a
mean
man
in
charge
there
i
called
on
him
told
him
i
was
an
old
college
pal
of
yours
and
tried
to
borrow
a
dollar
he
spurned
me
with
contumely
so
much
of
it
in
fact
that
i
imagine
you
have
a
number
of
such
friends
while
he
was
abusing
me
i
stole
from
his
desk
the
stamped
envelope
which
bears
to
you
these
tidings
of
great
woe
and
while
awaiting
your
reply
be
advised
that
i
subsist
on
the
bitter
cud
of
reflection
fresh
air
and
water
all
of
which
thank
god
cost
nothing
my
tale
is
soon
told
when
you
knew
me
last
i
was
a
prosperous
young
contractor
alas
i
put
all
my
eggs
in
one
basket
and
produced
an
omelet
took
a
contract
to
build
a
railroad
in
honduras
honduras
got
to
fighting
with
nicaragua
the
government
i
had
done
business
with
went
out
of
business
and
the
nicaraguan
army
recruited
all
my
labourers
and
mounted
them
on
my
mules
and
horses
swiped
all
my
grub
and
told
me
to
go
home
i
went
why
stay
moreover
i
had
an
incentive
consisting
of
about
an
inch
of
bayonet
fortunately
not
applied
in
a
vital
spot
which
accelerated
rather
than
decreased
my
speed
hurry
my
dear
cardigan
tempest
fidgets
remember
moriarity
which
if
you
still
remember
your
latin
means
time
flies
remember
i
finished
eating
my
overcoat
the
day
before
yesterday
make
it
a
hundred
and
god
will
bless
you
when
i
get
it
i
come
to
sequoia
and
kiss
you
i
pay
you
back
sometime
of
course
wistfully
thine
buck
ogilvy
delays
are
dangerous
and
procrastination
is
the
thief
of
b
john
cardigan
chuckled
i
take
buck
ogilvy
bryce
he
do
is
he
honest
i
do
know
he
was
the
last
time
i
saw
then
wire
him
a
hundred
do
wait
for
the
mail
the
steamer
that
carries
your
letter
might
be
wrecked
and
your
friend
ogilvy
forced
to
i
have
already
wired
him
the
hundred
in
all
probability
he
is
now
out
whirling
like
a
good
boy
well
i
think
we
planned
sufficient
for
the
present
bryce
you
better
leave
for
san
francisco
and
close
your
deal
with
gregory
arrange
with
him
to
leave
his
own
representative
with
ogilvy
to
keep
tab
on
the
job
check
the
bills
and
pay
them
as
they
fall
due
and
above
all
things
insist
that
gregory
shall
place
the
money
in
a
san
francisco
bank
subject
to
the
joint
check
of
his
representative
and
ours
hire
a
good
lawyer
to
draw
up
the
agreement
between
you
be
sure
you
right
and
then
go
ahead
full
speed
when
you
return
to
sequoia
i
have
a
few
more
points
to
give
you
mull
them
over
in
the
chapter
xxii
when
bryce
cardigan
walked
down
the
at
the
in
san
francisco
the
first
face
he
saw
among
the
waiting
crowd
was
buck
ogilvy
ogilvy
wore
his
and
a
joyous
smile
proving
that
in
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
all
was
well
with
the
world
he
pressed
forward
and
thrust
forth
a
great
speckled
paw
for
bryce
to
shake
bryce
ignored
it
why
do
you
remember
me
ogilvy
demanded
i
buck
bryce
looked
him
fairly
in
the
eye
and
favoured
him
with
a
lightning
wink
i
have
never
heard
of
you
ogilvy
you
are
mistaking
me
for
someone
sorry
ogilvy
murmured
my
mistake
thought
you
were
bill
kerrick
who
used
to
be
a
partner
of
mine
i
expecting
him
on
this
boat
and
he
the
speaking
image
of
bryce
nodded
and
passed
on
hailed
a
taxicab
and
was
driven
to
the
san
francisco
office
of
his
company
five
minutes
later
the
door
opened
and
buck
ogilvy
entered
i
was
a
bit
puzzled
at
the
dock
bryce
he
explained
as
they
shook
hands
but
decided
to
play
safe
and
then
follow
you
to
your
office
what
up
have
you
killed
somebody
and
are
the
detectives
on
your
trail
if
so
up
and
i
assume
the
responsibility
for
your
crime
just
to
show
you
how
grateful
i
am
for
that
no
i
was
being
shadowed
buck
but
my
principal
enemy
was
coming
down
the
gangplank
right
behind
me
and
so
was
my
principal
enemy
ogilvy
interrupted
what
does
our
enemy
look
like
like
ready
money
and
if
he
had
seen
me
shaking
hands
with
you
have
suspected
a
connection
between
us
later
on
buck
you
have
a
good
job
about
five
hundred
a
thanks
old
man
i
work
for
you
for
nothing
what
are
we
going
to
do
build
twelve
miles
of
logging
railroad
and
parallel
the
line
of
the
old
wolf
i
spoke
of
a
moment
good
news
we
do
it
how
soon
do
you
want
it
done
as
soon
as
possible
you
the
and
general
i
accept
the
nomination
what
do
i
do
first
listen
carefully
to
my
story
analyze
my
plan
for
possible
weak
spots
and
then
get
busy
because
after
i
have
provided
the
funds
and
given
the
word
the
rest
is
up
to
you
i
must
not
be
known
in
the
transaction
at
all
because
that
would
be
fatal
and
i
miss
my
guess
if
once
we
start
building
or
advertising
the
building
of
the
road
you
and
i
and
everybody
connected
with
the
enterprise
will
not
be
shadowed
day
and
night
by
an
army
of
i
listen
said
buck
ogilvy
and
he
inclined
a
large
speckled
ear
in
bryce
direction
the
while
his
large
speckled
hand
drew
a
toward
him
three
hours
later
ogilvy
was
in
possession
of
the
most
minute
details
of
the
situation
in
sequoia
had
tabulated
indexed
and
them
in
his
ingenious
brain
and
was
ready
for
business
and
so
announced
himself
and
inasmuch
as
that
hundred
you
sent
me
has
been
pretty
well
shattered
he
concluded
suppose
you
call
in
your
manager
who
refused
me
alms
on
your
credit
and
give
him
orders
to
honour
my
if
i
to
light
in
sequoia
looking
like
ready
money
got
to
have
some
clothes
and
a
shine
and
a
shave
and
a
shampoo
and
a
trunk
and
a
private
secretary
if
there
was
a
railroad
running
into
sequoia
i
insist
on
a
private
this
final
detail
having
been
attended
to
ogilvy
promptly
proceeded
to
forget
business
and
launched
forth
into
a
recital
of
his
manifold
adventures
since
leaving
princeton
and
when
at
length
all
of
their
classmates
had
been
accounted
for
and
listed
as
dead
married
prosperous
or
pauperized
the
amiable
and
highly
entertaining
buck
took
his
departure
with
the
announcement
that
he
would
look
around
a
little
and
try
to
buy
some
good
grading
equipment
and
a
locomotive
in
addition
to
casting
an
eye
over
the
labour
situation
and
sending
a
few
wires
east
for
the
purpose
of
sounding
the
market
on
steel
rails
always
an
enthusiast
in
all
things
in
his
mind
eye
ogilvy
could
already
see
a
long
trainload
of
logs
coming
down
the
northern
california
oregon
railroad
as
he
and
bryce
had
decided
to
christen
the
venture
n
ogilvy
murmured
sounds
brisk
and
snappy
i
like
it
hope
that
old
hunks
pennington
likes
it
too
he
probably
feel
that
stands
for
northern
california
when
bryce
cardigan
returned
to
sequoia
his
labours
insofar
as
the
building
of
the
road
were
concerned
had
been
completed
his
agreement
with
gregory
of
the
trinidad
redwood
timber
company
had
been
signed
sealed
and
delivered
the
money
to
build
the
road
had
been
deposited
in
bank
and
buck
ogilvy
was
already
spending
it
like
a
drunken
sailor
from
now
on
bryce
could
only
watch
wait
and
pray
on
the
next
steamer
a
surveying
party
with
complete
arrived
in
sequoia
purchased
a
wagon
and
two
horses
piled
their
dunnage
into
the
wagon
and
disappeared
hard
on
their
heels
came
buck
ogilvy
and
occupied
the
bridal
suite
in
the
hotel
sequoia
arrangements
for
which
had
previously
been
made
by
wire
in
the
sitting
room
of
the
suite
ogilvy
installed
a
new
desk
a
and
a
brisk
young
male
secretary
he
had
been
in
town
less
than
an
hour
when
the
editor
of
the
sequoia
sentinel
sent
up
his
card
the
announcement
of
the
incorporation
of
the
northern
california
outrage
for
so
had
ogilvy
in
huge
enjoyment
of
the
misery
he
was
about
to
create
dubbed
the
road
had
previously
been
flashed
to
the
sentinel
by
the
united
press
association
as
a
local
feature
story
and
already
speculation
was
rife
in
sequoia
as
to
the
identity
of
the
harebrained
individuals
who
dared
to
back
an
enterprise
as
nebulous
as
the
millennium
ogilvy
was
expecting
the
visit
in
fact
impatiently
awaiting
it
and
since
the
easiest
thing
he
did
was
to
speak
for
publication
naturally
the
editor
of
the
sentinel
got
a
story
which
to
that
individual
simple
soul
seemed
to
warrant
a
head
which
it
received
having
boned
up
on
the
literature
of
the
redwood
manufacturers
association
what
buck
ogilvy
did
know
about
redwood
timber
redwood
lumber
the
remaining
redwood
acreage
and
market
conditions
past
and
present
might
have
been
secreted
in
the
editorial
eye
without
seriously
hampering
the
editorial
sight
he
stated
that
the
capital
behind
the
project
was
foreign
that
he
believed
in
the
success
of
the
project
and
that
his
entire
fortune
was
dependent
upon
the
completion
of
it
in
glowing
terms
he
spoke
of
the
billions
of
tons
of
to
be
hauled
out
of
this
wonderfully
fertile
and
country
and
confidently
predicted
for
the
county
a
future
commercial
supremacy
that
would
be
simply
staggering
to
contemplate
when
colonel
seth
pennington
read
this
outburst
he
smiled
that
a
bright
scheme
on
the
part
of
that
trinidad
redwood
timber
company
gang
to
start
a
railroad
excitement
and
unload
their
white
elephant
he
declared
a
scheme
like
that
stuck
them
with
their
timber
and
i
suppose
they
figure
there
a
sucker
born
every
minute
and
that
the
same
old
gag
might
work
again
chances
are
they
have
a
prospect
in
tow
when
bryce
cardigan
read
it
he
laughed
the
interview
was
so
like
buck
ogilvy
in
the
morning
the
latter
automobile
was
brought
up
from
the
and
accompanied
by
his
secretary
ogilvy
disappeared
into
the
north
following
the
bright
new
stakes
of
his
and
for
three
weeks
was
seen
no
more
as
for
bryce
cardigan
that
young
man
buckled
down
to
business
and
whenever
questioned
about
the
new
railroad
was
careful
to
hoot
at
the
idea
on
a
day
when
bryce
mind
happened
to
be
occupied
with
thoughts
of
shirley
sumner
he
bumped
into
her
on
the
main
street
of
sequoia
and
to
her
great
relief
but
profound
surprise
he
paused
in
his
tracks
lifted
his
hat
smiled
and
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
thought
better
of
it
changed
his
mind
and
continued
on
about
his
business
as
shirley
passed
him
she
looked
him
squarely
in
the
face
and
in
her
glance
there
was
neither
coldness
nor
malice
bryce
felt
himself
afire
from
heels
to
hair
one
instant
and
cold
and
clammy
the
next
for
shirley
spoke
to
him
good
morning
he
paused
turned
and
approached
her
good
morning
shirley
he
replied
how
have
you
been
i
might
have
been
dead
for
all
the
interest
you
took
in
me
she
replied
sharply
as
matters
stand
i
exceedingly
well
thank
you
by
the
way
are
you
still
belligerent
he
nodded
i
have
to
still
peeved
at
my
uncle
again
he
nodded
i
think
you
a
great
big
grouch
bryce
cardigan
she
flared
at
him
suddenly
you
make
me
unutterably
i
sorry
he
answered
but
just
at
present
i
am
forced
to
subject
you
to
the
strain
say
a
year
from
now
when
things
are
different
with
me
i
strive
not
to
i
not
be
here
a
year
from
now
she
warned
him
he
bowed
then
i
go
wherever
you
are
and
bring
you
and
with
a
mocking
little
grin
he
lifted
his
hat
and
passed
on
chapter
xxiii
though
buck
ogilvy
was
gone
from
sequoia
for
a
period
of
three
weeks
he
was
by
no
means
forgotten
his
secretary
proved
to
be
an
industrious
who
by
mail
telegraph
and
telephone
managed
daily
to
keep
the
editor
of
the
sequoia
sentinel
fully
apprised
of
all
developments
in
the
matter
of
the
northern
california
oregon
railroad
company
including
some
that
had
not
as
yet
developed
the
result
was
copious
and
persistent
publicity
for
the
new
railroad
company
and
the
arousing
in
the
public
mind
of
a
genuine
interest
in
this
railroad
which
was
to
do
so
much
for
the
town
of
sequoia
colonel
seth
pennington
was
among
those
who
skeptical
at
first
and
inclined
to
ridicule
the
project
into
an
early
grave
eventually
found
himself
swayed
by
the
publicity
and
gradually
coerced
into
serious
consideration
of
the
results
attendant
upon
the
building
of
the
road
the
colonel
was
naturally
as
suspicious
as
a
rattlesnake
in
august
hence
he
had
no
sooner
emerged
from
the
ranks
of
the
frank
scoffers
than
his
alert
mind
framed
the
question
how
is
this
new
road
improbable
as
i
know
it
to
be
going
to
affect
the
interests
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
if
the
unexpected
should
happen
and
those
should
actually
build
a
road
from
sequoia
to
grant
pass
oregon
and
thus
construct
a
feeder
to
a
transcontinental
line
five
minutes
of
serious
reflection
sufficed
to
bring
the
colonel
to
the
verge
of
panic
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
yielding
to
fright
despite
his
firm
belief
that
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
frightened
similar
considerations
occur
to
a
small
boy
who
is
walking
home
in
the
dark
past
a
cemetery
the
vital
aspects
of
his
predicament
dawned
on
the
colonel
one
night
at
dinner
midway
between
the
soup
and
the
fish
so
forcibly
did
they
occur
to
him
in
fact
that
for
the
nonce
he
forgot
that
his
niece
was
seated
opposite
him
confound
them
the
colonel
murmured
distinctly
i
must
look
into
this
look
into
what
uncle
dear
shirley
asked
innocently
this
new
railroad
that
man
ogilvy
talks
of
building
which
means
shirley
that
with
sequoia
as
his
starting
point
he
is
going
to
build
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
north
to
connect
with
the
main
line
of
the
southern
pacific
in
but
would
that
be
the
finest
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
to
humboldt
county
she
demanded
of
him
undoubtedly
it
would
to
humboldt
county
but
to
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
in
which
you
have
something
more
than
a
sentimental
interest
my
dear
it
would
be
a
blow
a
large
part
of
the
estate
left
by
your
father
is
invested
in
laguna
grande
stock
and
as
you
know
all
of
my
efforts
are
devoted
to
appreciating
that
stock
and
to
fighting
against
anything
that
has
a
tendency
to
depreciate
which
reminds
me
uncle
seth
that
you
never
discuss
with
me
any
of
the
matters
pertaining
to
my
business
interests
she
suggested
he
beamed
upon
her
with
his
patronizing
and
indulgent
smile
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
puzzle
that
pretty
head
of
yours
with
business
affairs
while
i
am
alive
and
on
the
job
he
answered
however
since
you
have
expressed
a
desire
to
have
this
railroad
situation
explained
to
you
i
will
do
so
i
am
not
interested
in
seeing
a
feeder
built
from
sequoia
north
to
grant
pass
and
connecting
with
the
southern
pacific
but
i
am
tremendously
interested
in
seeing
a
feeder
built
south
from
sequoia
toward
san
francisco
to
connect
with
the
northwestern
why
for
cold
calculating
business
reasons
my
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
resumed
a
few
months
ago
i
would
not
have
told
you
the
things
i
am
about
to
tell
you
shirley
for
the
reason
that
a
few
months
ago
it
seemed
to
me
you
were
destined
to
become
rather
friendly
with
young
cardigan
when
that
fellow
desires
to
be
agreeable
he
can
be
rather
a
likable
boy
lovable
even
you
are
both
young
with
young
people
who
have
many
things
in
common
and
are
thrown
together
in
a
community
like
sequoia
a
lively
friendship
may
develop
into
an
ardent
love
and
it
has
been
my
experience
that
ardent
love
not
infrequently
leads
to
the
shirley
blushed
and
her
uncle
chuckled
fortunately
he
continued
bryce
cardigan
had
the
misfortune
to
show
himself
to
you
in
his
true
colours
and
you
had
the
good
sense
to
dismiss
him
consequently
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
explain
to
you
now
what
i
considered
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
withhold
from
you
at
that
time
provided
of
course
that
all
this
does
not
bore
you
to
do
go
on
uncle
seth
i
tremendously
interested
averred
shirley
shortly
after
i
launched
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
in
which
as
your
guardian
and
executor
of
your
father
estate
i
deemed
it
wise
to
invest
part
of
your
inheritance
i
found
myself
forced
to
seek
further
for
sound
investments
for
your
surplus
funds
now
good
timber
bought
cheap
inevitably
will
be
sold
dear
at
least
such
has
been
my
observation
during
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
old
john
cardigan
had
some
twenty
thousand
acres
of
the
finest
redwood
timber
in
the
state
timber
which
had
cost
him
an
average
price
of
less
than
fifty
cents
per
thousand
well
in
this
instance
the
old
man
had
overreached
himself
and
finding
it
necessary
to
increase
his
working
capital
he
incorporated
his
holdings
into
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
and
floated
a
of
a
million
dollars
they
were
six
per
cent
certificates
the
security
was
ample
and
i
invested
for
you
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
cardigan
bonds
i
bought
them
at
eighty
and
they
were
worth
two
hundred
at
least
they
would
have
been
worth
two
hundred
under
my
management
how
did
you
manage
to
buy
them
so
cheap
she
interrupted
old
cardigan
had
had
a
long
run
of
bad
luck
due
to
bad
management
and
bad
judgment
my
dear
and
when
a
corporation
is
bonded
the
bondholders
have
access
to
its
financial
statements
from
time
to
time
i
discovered
bondholders
who
needed
money
and
hence
unloaded
at
a
sacrifice
but
by
far
the
majority
of
the
bonds
i
purchased
for
your
account
were
owned
by
local
people
who
had
lost
confidence
in
john
cardigan
and
the
future
of
the
redwood
lumber
industry
hereabouts
you
understand
do
you
not
i
do
not
understand
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
a
very
well
i
shall
proceed
to
he
held
up
his
index
finger
item
one
for
years
old
john
cardigan
has
rendered
valueless
because
inaccessible
hundred
acres
of
laguna
grande
timber
on
squaw
creek
his
absurd
valley
of
the
giants
blocks
the
outlet
and
of
course
he
persisted
in
refusing
me
a
right
of
way
through
that
little
dab
of
timber
in
order
to
discourage
me
and
force
me
to
sell
him
that
squaw
creek
timber
at
his
yes
shirley
agreed
i
dare
say
that
was
his
object
was
it
reprehensible
of
him
uncle
seth
not
a
bit
my
dear
he
was
simply
playing
the
cold
game
of
business
i
would
have
done
the
same
thing
to
cardigan
had
the
situation
been
reversed
we
played
a
game
together
and
i
admit
that
he
won
fairly
and
then
why
is
it
that
you
feel
such
resentment
against
him
oh
i
do
resent
the
old
fool
shirley
he
merely
annoys
me
i
suppose
i
feel
a
certain
natural
chagrin
at
having
been
beaten
and
in
consequence
cherish
an
equally
natural
desire
to
pay
the
old
schemer
back
in
his
own
coin
under
the
rules
as
we
play
the
game
such
action
on
my
part
is
perfectly
permissible
is
it
not
yes
she
agreed
frankly
i
think
it
is
uncle
seth
certainly
if
he
blocked
you
and
rendered
your
timber
valueless
there
is
no
reason
why
if
you
have
the
opportunity
you
should
not
block
him
and
render
his
timber
the
colonel
banged
the
table
with
his
fist
so
heartily
that
the
silver
fairly
leaped
spoken
like
a
man
he
declared
i
have
the
opportunity
and
am
proceeding
to
impress
the
cardigans
with
the
truth
of
the
old
saying
that
every
dog
must
have
his
day
when
cardigan
contract
with
our
road
for
the
hauling
of
his
logs
expires
by
limitation
next
year
i
am
not
going
to
renew
it
at
least
not
until
i
have
forced
him
to
make
me
the
concessions
i
desire
and
certainly
not
at
the
present
ruinous
then
said
shirley
eagerly
if
you
got
a
right
of
way
through
his
valley
of
the
giants
you
would
renew
the
contract
he
has
with
you
for
the
hauling
of
his
logs
would
you
not
i
would
have
before
young
cardigan
raised
such
hades
that
day
in
the
before
old
cardigan
sold
his
valley
of
the
giants
to
another
burglar
and
before
i
had
gathered
indubitable
evidence
that
neither
of
the
cardigans
knows
enough
about
managing
a
sawmill
and
selling
lumber
to
guarantee
a
reasonable
profit
on
the
capital
they
have
invested
and
still
pay
the
interest
on
their
bonded
and
floating
indebtedness
shirley
i
bought
those
cardigan
bonds
for
you
because
i
thought
old
cardigan
knew
his
business
and
would
make
the
bonds
valuable
make
them
worth
par
instead
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
is
tottering
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
the
bonds
i
purchased
for
you
are
now
worth
less
than
i
paid
for
them
and
by
next
year
the
cardigans
will
default
on
the
interest
so
i
going
to
sit
tight
and
decline
to
have
any
more
business
dealings
with
the
cardigans
when
their
hauling
contract
expires
i
shall
not
renew
it
under
any
circumstances
that
will
prevent
them
from
getting
logs
and
so
they
will
automatically
go
out
of
the
lumber
business
and
into
the
hands
of
a
receiver
and
since
you
are
the
largest
individual
stockholder
i
representing
you
and
a
number
of
minor
bondholders
will
dominate
the
executive
committee
of
the
bondholders
when
they
meet
to
consider
what
shall
be
done
when
the
cardigans
default
on
their
interest
and
the
payment
due
the
sinking
fund
i
shall
then
have
myself
appointed
receiver
for
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
investigate
its
affairs
thoroughly
and
see
for
myself
whether
or
no
there
is
a
possibility
of
working
it
out
of
the
jam
it
is
in
and
saving
you
a
loss
on
your
bonds
i
must
pursue
this
course
my
dear
in
justice
to
you
and
the
other
bondholders
if
on
the
other
hand
i
find
the
situation
hopeless
or
conclude
that
a
period
of
several
years
must
ensue
before
the
cardigans
work
out
of
debt
i
shall
recommend
to
the
bank
which
holds
the
deed
of
trust
and
acts
as
trustee
that
the
property
be
sold
at
public
auction
to
the
highest
bidder
to
reimburse
the
bondholders
of
course
he
hastened
to
add
if
the
property
sells
for
more
than
the
corporation
owes
such
excess
will
then
in
due
course
be
turned
over
to
the
is
it
likely
to
sell
at
a
price
in
excess
of
the
indebtedness
shirley
queried
anxiously
it
is
possible
but
scarcely
probable
he
answered
dryly
i
have
in
mind
under
those
circumstances
bidding
the
property
in
for
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
and
merging
it
with
our
holdings
paying
part
of
the
of
the
cardigan
property
in
cardigan
bonds
and
the
remainder
in
but
what
will
the
cardigans
do
then
uncle
seth
well
long
before
the
necessity
for
such
a
contingency
arises
the
old
man
will
have
been
gathered
to
the
bosom
of
abraham
and
after
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
has
ceased
to
exist
young
cardigan
can
go
to
work
for
a
would
you
give
him
employment
uncle
seth
i
would
not
do
you
think
i
crazy
shirley
remember
my
dear
there
is
no
sentiment
in
business
if
there
was
we
would
have
any
i
think
i
understand
uncle
seth
with
the
exception
of
what
effect
the
building
of
the
has
upon
your
item
two
he
challenged
and
ticked
it
off
on
his
middle
finger
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
owns
two
fine
bodies
of
redwood
timber
widely
separated
one
to
the
south
of
sequoia
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
and
at
present
practically
valueless
because
inaccessible
and
the
other
to
the
north
of
sequoia
immediately
adjoining
our
holdings
in
township
nine
and
valuable
because
of
its
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
her
smilingly
the
logging
railroad
of
our
corporation
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
makes
it
accessible
now
while
the
building
of
the
would
be
a
grand
thing
for
the
county
in
general
we
can
get
along
without
it
because
it
does
help
us
out
particularly
we
already
have
a
railroad
running
from
our
timber
to
tidewater
and
we
can
reach
the
markets
of
the
world
with
our
i
think
i
understand
uncle
seth
when
cardigan
hauling
contract
with
our
road
expires
his
timber
in
township
nine
will
depreciate
in
value
because
it
will
no
longer
be
accessible
while
our
timber
being
still
accessible
retains
its
exactly
and
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
shirley
i
do
not
want
cardigan
timber
in
township
nine
given
back
its
value
through
accessibility
provided
by
the
if
that
road
is
not
built
cardigan
timber
in
township
nine
will
be
valuable
to
us
but
not
to
another
living
soul
moreover
the
trinidad
redwood
timber
company
has
a
raft
of
fine
timber
still
farther
north
and
adjoining
the
holdings
of
our
company
and
cardigan
and
if
this
infernal
is
built
we
be
enabled
to
buy
that
trinidad
timber
pretty
cheap
one
of
these
bright
days
all
of
which
appears
to
me
to
constitute
sound
business
logic
uncle
he
nodded
item
three
he
continued
and
ticked
it
off
on
his
third
finger
i
want
to
see
the
feeder
for
a
transcontinental
line
built
into
sequoia
from
the
south
for
the
reason
that
it
will
tap
the
cardigan
holdings
in
the
san
hedrin
watershed
and
give
a
tremendous
value
to
timber
which
at
the
present
time
is
rather
a
negative
asset
consequently
i
would
prefer
to
have
that
value
created
after
san
hedrin
timber
has
been
merged
with
the
assets
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
and
so
i
must
investigate
this
outfit
and
block
it
if
possible
and
it
should
be
how
for
instance
i
have
considered
the
means
my
dear
those
come
later
for
the
present
i
am
convinced
that
the
is
a
corporate
joke
sprung
on
the
dear
public
by
the
trinidad
redwood
timber
company
to
get
the
said
dear
public
excited
create
a
boom
and
boost
before
the
boom
collapses
a
condition
which
will
follow
the
collapse
of
the
the
trinidad
people
hope
to
sell
their
holdings
and
get
from
really
said
shirley
demurely
the
more
i
see
of
business
the
more
fascinating
i
find
shirley
it
the
grandest
game
in
the
and
yet
she
added
musingly
old
cardigan
is
so
blind
and
they
be
saying
that
about
me
some
day
if
i
live
to
be
as
old
as
john
nevertheless
i
feel
sorry
for
him
uncle
well
if
you
continue
to
waste
your
sympathy
on
him
rather
than
on
his
son
i
not
object
he
retorted
laughingly
oh
bryce
cardigan
is
able
to
take
care
of
yes
and
mean
he
saved
our
lives
uncle
he
had
to
in
order
to
save
his
own
do
forget
that
my
carefully
he
dissected
a
and
removed
the
backbone
i
give
a
ripe
peach
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
scheming
buttinsky
who
bought
old
cardigan
valley
of
the
giants
he
said
presently
i
be
hanged
if
that
does
complicate
matters
a
you
should
have
bought
it
when
the
opportunity
offered
she
reminded
him
you
could
have
had
it
then
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
less
than
you
would
have
paid
for
it
a
year
ago
and
i
sure
that
should
have
been
sufficient
indication
to
you
that
the
game
you
and
the
cardigans
had
been
playing
so
long
had
come
to
an
end
he
was
beaten
and
acknowledged
it
and
i
think
you
might
have
been
a
little
more
generous
to
your
fallen
enemy
uncle
i
dare
say
he
admitted
lightly
however
i
was
and
now
i
going
to
be
punished
for
it
my
dear
so
do
roast
me
any
more
by
the
way
that
speckled
fellow
ogilvy
who
is
promoting
the
northern
california
oregon
railroad
is
back
in
town
again
somehow
i
much
confidence
in
that
fellow
i
think
i
wire
the
san
francisco
office
to
look
him
up
in
dun
and
bradstreet
folks
up
this
way
are
taking
too
much
for
granted
on
that
fellow
mere
say
so
but
i
for
one
intend
to
delve
for
facts
particularly
with
regard
to
the
and
ogilvy
associates
i
sleep
a
whole
lot
more
soundly
if
i
knew
the
answer
to
two
very
important
what
are
they
uncle
seth
well
i
like
to
know
whether
the
is
genuine
or
a
screen
to
hide
the
operations
of
the
trinidad
redwood
timber
it
might
said
shirley
with
one
of
those
sudden
flashes
of
intuition
peculiar
to
women
be
a
screen
to
hide
the
operations
of
bryce
cardigan
now
that
he
knows
you
are
going
to
renew
his
hauling
contract
he
may
have
decided
to
build
his
own
logging
after
a
pause
the
colonel
made
answer
no
i
have
no
fear
of
that
it
would
cost
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
build
that
line
and
bridge
mad
river
and
the
cardigans
have
got
that
amount
of
money
what
more
they
ca
get
but
suppose
she
persisted
that
the
real
builder
of
the
road
should
prove
to
be
bryce
cardigan
after
all
what
would
you
do
colonel
pennington
eyes
twinkled
i
greatly
fear
my
dear
i
should
make
a
noise
like
something
suppose
you
lost
the
in
that
event
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
would
be
any
worse
off
than
it
is
at
present
the
principal
loser
as
i
view
the
situation
would
be
miss
shirley
sumner
who
has
the
misfortune
to
be
loaded
up
with
cardigan
bonds
and
as
for
bryce
cardigan
well
that
young
man
would
certainly
know
he
been
through
a
i
wonder
if
he
fight
to
the
last
uncle
why
i
believe
he
will
pennington
replied
soberly
i
love
to
see
you
beat
shirley
why
my
dear
you
growing
her
uncle
tones
were
laden
with
banter
but
his
countenance
could
not
conceal
the
pleasure
her
last
remark
had
given
him
why
not
i
have
something
at
stake
have
i
not
then
you
really
want
me
to
smash
him
the
colonel
voice
proclaimed
his
incredulity
you
got
me
into
this
fight
by
buying
cardigan
bonds
for
me
she
replied
meaningly
and
i
look
to
you
to
save
the
investment
or
as
much
of
it
as
possible
for
certainly
if
it
should
develop
that
the
cardigans
are
the
real
promoters
of
the
to
permit
them
to
go
another
dollars
into
debt
in
a
forlorn
hope
of
saving
a
company
already
with
indebtedness
would
savor
of
common
business
sense
would
it
the
colonel
rose
hastily
came
around
the
table
and
kissed
her
paternally
my
dear
he
murmured
you
such
a
comfort
to
me
upon
my
word
you
i
so
glad
you
have
explained
the
situation
to
me
uncle
i
would
have
explained
it
long
ago
had
i
not
cherished
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
er
well
that
despite
everything
young
cardigan
might
er
influence
you
against
your
better
judgment
and
er
you
silly
man
he
shrugged
one
must
figure
every
angle
of
a
possible
situation
my
dear
and
i
should
hesitate
to
start
something
with
the
cardigans
and
have
you
because
of
foolish
sentiment
call
off
my
shirley
thrust
out
her
adorable
chin
aggressively
sick
tige
she
answered
shake
up
boy
you
bet
i
shake
up
the
colonel
declared
joyously
he
paused
with
a
morsel
of
food
on
his
fork
and
waved
the
fork
at
her
aggressively
you
stimulate
me
into
activity
shirley
my
mind
has
been
singularly
dull
of
late
i
have
worried
unnecessarily
but
now
that
i
know
you
are
with
me
i
am
inspired
i
tell
you
how
we
fix
this
new
railroad
if
it
exhibits
signs
of
being
again
he
smote
the
table
we
sew
up
tighter
than
a
new
do
tell
me
how
she
pleaded
eagerly
i
block
them
on
their
franchise
to
run
over
the
city
streets
of
how
by
making
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
see
things
my
way
he
answered
dryly
furthermore
in
order
to
enter
sequoia
the
will
have
to
cross
the
tracks
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
line
on
water
street
make
a
and
i
enjoin
them
and
hold
them
up
in
the
courts
till
the
cows
come
uncle
seth
you
a
well
at
least
i
no
slouch
at
looking
after
my
own
interests
and
yours
shirley
in
the
midst
of
peace
we
should
be
prepared
for
war
you
met
mayor
poundstone
and
his
lady
have
you
i
had
tea
at
her
house
last
good
news
suppose
you
invite
her
and
poundstone
here
for
dinner
some
night
this
week
just
a
quiet
little
family
dinner
shirley
and
after
dinner
you
can
take
poundstone
upstairs
on
some
pretext
or
other
while
i
sound
poundstone
out
on
his
attitude
toward
the
o
they
have
asked
for
a
franchise
yet
at
least
the
sentinel
has
printed
a
word
about
it
but
when
they
do
of
course
the
franchise
will
be
advertised
for
sale
to
the
highest
bidder
naturally
i
do
want
to
bid
against
them
they
might
run
the
price
up
on
me
and
leave
me
with
a
franchise
on
my
hands
something
i
do
not
want
because
i
have
no
use
for
the
blamed
thing
myself
i
feel
certain
however
i
can
find
some
less
expensive
means
of
keeping
them
out
of
it
say
by
convincing
poundstone
and
a
majority
of
the
city
council
that
the
is
not
such
a
public
asset
as
its
promoters
claim
for
it
hence
i
think
it
wise
to
sound
the
situation
out
in
advance
do
you
my
dear
she
nodded
i
shall
attend
to
the
matter
uncle
five
minutes
after
dinner
was
over
shirley
joined
her
uncle
in
the
library
and
announced
that
his
honor
the
mayor
and
poundstone
would
be
delighted
to
dine
with
them
on
the
following
thursday
night
chapter
xxiv
to
return
to
bryce
cardigan
having
completed
his
preliminary
plans
to
build
the
bryce
had
returned
to
sequoia
prepared
to
sit
quietly
on
the
and
watch
his
peppery
henchman
buck
ogilvy
go
into
action
the
more
bryce
considered
that
young
man
fitness
for
the
position
he
occupied
the
more
satisfied
did
he
become
with
his
decision
while
he
had
not
been
in
touch
with
ogilvy
for
several
years
he
had
known
him
intimately
at
princeton
in
his
last
year
at
college
ogilvy
father
a
railroad
magnate
had
come
a
disastrous
cropper
in
the
stock
market
thus
throwing
buck
upon
his
own
resources
and
cutting
short
his
college
career
which
was
probably
the
very
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
his
father
son
for
a
brief
period
perhaps
five
minutes
buck
had
staggered
under
the
blow
then
his
tremendous
optimism
had
asserted
itself
and
while
he
packed
his
trunk
he
had
planned
for
the
future
as
to
how
that
future
had
developed
the
reader
will
have
gleaned
some
slight
idea
from
the
information
imparted
in
his
letter
to
bryce
cardigan
already
quoted
in
a
word
ogilvy
had
had
his
ups
and
downs
ogilvy
return
to
sequoia
following
his
tour
in
search
of
rights
of
way
for

heralded
by
a
visit
from
him
to
bryce
cardigan
at
the
latter
office
as
he
breasted
the
counter
in
the
general
office
moira
mctavish
left
her
desk
and
came
over
to
see
what
the
visitor
desired
i
should
like
to
see
bryce
cardigan
buck
began
in
crisp
businesslike
accents
he
was
fumbling
in
his
and
did
not
look
up
until
about
to
hand
his
card
to
moira
when
his
mouth
flew
half
open
the
while
he
stared
at
her
with
consummate
frankness
the
girl
glance
met
his
momentarily
then
was
lowered
modestly
she
took
the
card
and
carried
it
to
bryce
bryce
grunted
that
noisy
fellow
ogilvy
eh
his
clothes
are
simply
wonderful
and
so
is
his
voice

very
refined
but
he
carroty

and
has
freckled
hands
bryce
rose
and
sauntered
into
the
general
office
mr
bryce
cardigan

queried
politely
with
an
interrogative
lift
of
his
blond
eyebrows
at
your
service
ogilvy

you
so
much
he
followed
bryce
to
the
latter
private
office

the
door
carefully
behind
him
and
stood
with
his
broad
back
against
it

it
i
should
say
not

believe
you

quite
sane

would
run
the
risk
of
being
seen

old

not
the
of
the
northern
california
oregon
railroad
and

soulless
corporation

see
fit
he
sat
down
crossed
his
long
legs
and
jerked
a
speckled
thumb
toward
the
outer
office
i
was
sane
when
i
came
in
here
but
the
eyes
of
the
girl
outside
oh

them
eyes
i
must
be
introduced
to

an
houri
like
that
around

a
dollar
and
spun
it
in
the
air
nothing
doing
buck

yourself
these
agonizing
suspicions
the
fact
of
the
matter

wonderful
inspiration

bryce

a
kind
word
for
me
wo
you
sort
of
boom
my
stock
eh
be
a
good
certainly
now
come
down
to
earth
and
render
a
report
on
your
i
try
to
begin
i
secured
rights
of
way
at
a
total
cost
of
twelve
thousand
one
hundred
and
three
dollars
and
nine
cents
from
the
city
limits
of
sequoia
to
the
southern
boundary
of
your
timber
in
township
nine
i
got
my
line
surveyed
and
so
far
as
the
building
of
the
road
is
concerned
i
know
exactly
what
i
going
to
do
and
how
and
when
i
going
to
do
it
once
i
get
my
material
on
the
what
steps
have
you
taken
toward
securing
your
material
well
i
can
close
a
favourable
contract
for
steel
rails
with
the
colorado
steel
products
company
their
schedule
of
deliveries
is
as
far
as
san
francisco
but
it
up
to
you
to
provide
water
transportation
from
there
to
we
can
handle
the
rails
on
our
steam
schooners
next
i
have
an
option
of
a
rattling
good
locomotive
down
at
the
santa
fe
shops
and
the
hawkins
barnes
construction
company
have
offered
me
a
steam
shovel
half
a
dozen
and
a
lot
of
fresnos
and
scrapers
at
ruinous
prices
this
equipment
is
pretty
well
worn
and
they
want
to
get
rid
of
it
before
buying
new
stuff
for
their
contract
to
build
the
arizona
and
sonora
central
however
it
is
equipment
for
us
because
it
will
last
until
we
through
with
it
then
we
can
scrap
it
for
junk
we
can
buy
or
rent
teams
from
local
citizens
and
get
half
of
our
labour
locally
san
francisco
employment
bureaus
will
readily
supply
the
remainder
and
i
have
half
a
dozen
fine
boys
on
tap
to
boss
the
steam
shovel
gang
and
construction
gang
and
as
soon
as
you
tell
me
how
i
to
get
my
material
ashore
and
out
on
the
job
i
order
it
and
get
that
exactly
where
the
shoe
begins
to
pinch
pennington
tracks
enter
the
city
along
water
street
with
one
spur
into
his
and
another
out
on
his
from
the
tracks
we
also
have
built
a
spur
through
our
out
to
our
and
a
out
on
to
our
milldock
we
can
unload
our
locomotive
steam
shovel
and
on
our
own
wharf
but
unless
pennington
gives
us
permission
to
use
his
tracks
out
to
a
point
beyond
the
city
limits
where
a
y
will
lead
off
to
the
point
where
our
construction
begins
we
up
a
suppose
he
refuses
bryce
what
then
why
we
simply
have
to
enter
the
city
down
front
street
paralleling
pennington
tracks
on
water
street
turning
down
b
street
make
a
of
pennington
line
on
water
street
and
connecting
with
the
spur
into
our
ca
have
an
elbow
turn
at
front
and
b
streets
do
have
to
we
own
a
square
block
on
that
corner
and
we
build
across
it
making
a
gradual
see
here
my
son
buck
said
solemnly
is
this
your
first
adventure
in
railroad
building
bryce
nodded
i
thought
so
otherwise
you
would
talk
so
confidently
of
running
your
line
over
city
streets
and
making
on
your
competitor
road
if
your
competitor
regards
you
as
a
menace
to
his
pocketbook
he
can
give
you
a
nice
little
run
for
your
money
and
delay
you
i
realize
that
buck
that
why
i
not
appearing
in
this
railroad
deal
at
all
if
pennington
suspected
i
was
back
of
it
he
fight
me
before
the
city
council
and
move
heaven
and
earth
to
keep
me
out
of
a
franchise
to
use
the
city
streets
and
cross
his
line
of
course
since
his
main
line
runs
on
city
property
under
a
franchise
granted
by
the
city
the
city
has
a
perfect
right
to
grant
me
the
privilege
of
making
a
of
his
line
will
they
do
it
that
the
problem
if
they
will
not
you
licked
my
son
and
i
out
of
a
we
can
sue
and
condemn
a
right
of
yes
but
if
the
city
council
puts
up
a
plea
that
it
is
against
the
best
interests
of
the
city
to
grant
the
franchise
you
find
that
except
in
most
extraordinary
cases
the
courts
regard
it
as
against
public
policy
to
give
judgment
against
a
municipality
the
state
or
the
government
of
the
united
states
at
any
rate
they
hang
you
up
in
the
courts
till
you
die
of
old
age
and
as
i
understand
the
matter
you
have
to
have
this
line
running
in
less
than
a
year
or
go
out
of
bryce
hung
his
head
thoughtfully
i
been
too
cocksure
he
muttered
presently
i
should
have
spent
that
twelve
thousand
for
rights
of
way
until
i
had
settled
the
matter
of
the
oh
i
did
buy
any
rights
of
way
yet
ogilvy
hastened
to
assure
him
i
only
signed
the
up
on
an
agreement
to
give
or
sell
me
a
right
of
way
at
the
stipulated
figures
any
time
within
one
year
from
date
the
cost
of
the
surveying
gang
and
my
salary
and
expenses
are
all
that
you
are
out
to
buck
you
a
not
at
all
i
merely
been
through
all
this
before
and
have
profited
by
my
experience
now
then
to
get
back
to
our
muttons
will
the
city
council
grant
you
a
franchise
to
enter
the
city
and
jump
tracks
i
sure
i
do
know
buck
you
have
to
ask
them
sound
them
out
the
city
council
meets
saturday
they
meet
this
evening
in
the
private
diningroom
of
the
hotel
sequoia
if
i
can
arrange
it
buck
ogilvy
declared
emphatically
going
to
have
them
all
up
for
dinner
and
talk
the
matter
over
i
not
exactly
aged
bryce
but
i
handled
about
fifteen
city
councils
and
county
boards
of
supervisors
not
to
mention
mexican
and
central
american
governors
and
presidents
in
my
day
and
i
know
the
breed
from
cover
to
cover
following
a
preliminary
conference
i
let
you
know
whether
you
going
to
get
that
franchise
without
difficulty
or
whether
somebody
itchy
palm
will
have
to
be
crossed
with
silver
first
honest
men
never
temporize
you
know
where
they
stand
but
a
grafter
temporizes
and
plays
a
waiting
game
hoping
to
wear
your
patience
down
to
the
point
where
you
ask
him
bluntly
to
name
his
figure
by
the
way
what
do
you
know
about
your
blighted
old
city
council
anyway
two
of
the
five
councilmen
are
for
sale
two
are
honest
men
and
one
is
an
uncertain
quantity
the
mayor
is
a
politician
i
known
them
all
since
boyhood
and
if
i
dared
come
out
in
the
open
i
think
that
even
the
crooks
have
sentiment
enough
for
what
the
cardigans
stand
for
in
this
county
to
decline
to
hold
me
then
why
not
come
out
in
the
open
and
save
trouble
and
expense
i
am
not
ready
to
have
a
lot
of
notes
called
on
me
bryce
replied
dryly
neither
am
i
desirous
of
having
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
start
a
riot
in
the
redwood
lumber
market
by
cutting
prices
to
a
point
where
i
would
have
to
sell
my
lumber
at
a
loss
in
order
to
get
hold
of
a
little
ready
money
neither
do
i
desire
to
have
trees
felled
across
the
right
of
way
of
pennington
road
after
his
trainloads
of
logs
have
gone
through
and
before
mine
have
started
from
the
woods
i
do
want
my
jammed
until
i
ca
move
and
i
do
want
engineer
to
take
a
curve
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
whip
my
loaded
off
into
a
canon
and
leave
me
hung
up
for
lack
of
i
tell
you
the
man
has
me
under
his
thumb
and
the
only
way
i
can
escape
is
to
slip
out
when
he
is
looking
he
can
do
too
many
things
to
block
the
delivery
of
my
logs
and
then
dub
them
acts
of
god
in
order
to
avoid
a
judgment
against
him
on
suit
for
of
his
hauling
contract
with
this
slimy
old
beggar
is
he
i
dare
say
he
would
hesitate
to
buy
the
city
council
to
block
you
would
he
i
know
he
lie
and
steal
i
dare
say
he
corrupt
a
public
buck
ogilvy
rose
and
stretched
himself
i
got
my
work
cut
out
for
me
have
i
he
declared
with
a
yawn
however
it
be
a
fight
worth
while
and
that
at
least
will
make
it
interesting
well
bryce
pressed
the
buzzer
on
his
desk
and
a
moment
later
moira
entered
permit
me
moira
to
present
ogilvy
ogilvy
miss
the
introduction
having
been
acknowledged
by
both
parties
bryce
continued
mr
ogilvy
will
have
frequent
need
to
interview
me
at
this
office
moira
but
it
is
our
joint
desire
that
his
visits
here
shall
remain
a
profound
secret
to
everybody
with
the
exception
of
ourselves
to
that
end
he
will
hereafter
call
at
night
when
this
portion
of
the
town
is
absolutely
deserted
you
have
an
extra
key
to
the
office
moira
i
wish
you
would
give
it
to
the
girl
nodded
mr
ogilvy
will
have
to
take
pains
to
avoid
our
watchman
she
suggested
that
is
a
point
well
taken
moira
buck
when
you
call
make
it
a
point
to
arrive
here
promptly
on
the
hour
the
watchman
will
be
down
in
the
mill
then
punching
the
again
moira
inclined
her
dark
head
and
withdrew
buck
ogilvy
groaned
god
speed
the
day
when
you
can
come
out
from
under
and
be
permitted
to
call
during
office
hours
he
murmured
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
withdrew
via
the
general
office
half
an
hour
later
bryce
looked
out
and
saw
him
draped
over
the
counter
engaged
in
animated
conversation
with
moira
mctavish
before
ogilvy
left
he
had
managed
to
impress
moira
with
a
sense
of
the
disadvantage
under
which
he
laboured
through
being
forced
because
of
circumstances
cardigan
would
doubtless
relate
to
her
in
due
course
to
abandon
all
hope
of
seeing
her
at
the
office
at
least
for
some
time
to
come
then
he
spoke
feelingly
of
the
unmitigated
horror
of
being
a
stranger
in
a
strange
town
forced
to
sit
around
hotel
lobbies
with
drummers
and
other
lost
souls
and
drew
from
moira
the
assurance
that
it
was
more
distressing
than
having
to
sit
around
a
boardinghouse
night
after
night
watching
old
women
tat
and
tattle
this
was
the
opening
buck
ogilvy
had
sparred
for
fixing
moira
with
his
bright
blue
eyes
he
grinned
boldly
and
said
suppose
miss
mctavish
we
start
a
league
for
the
dispersion
of
gloom
you
be
the
president
and
i
be
the
financial
how
would
the
league
operate
moira
demanded
cautiously
well
it
might
begin
by
giving
a
dinner
to
all
the
members
followed
by
a
little
into
the
country
next
saturday
afternoon
buck
suggested
moira
madonna
glance
appraised
him
steadily
i
have
known
you
very
long
ogilvy
she
reminded
him
oh
i
easy
to
get
acquainted
with
he
retorted
lightly
besides
do
i
come
well
recommended
he
pondered
for
a
moment
then
tell
you
what
miss
mctavish
suppose
we
put
it
up
to
bryce
cardigan
if
he
says
it
all
right
we
pull
off
the
party
if
he
says
it
all
wrong
i
go
out
and
drown
myself
and
fairer
words
than
them
has
no
man
i
think
it
over
said
moira
by
all
means
never
decide
such
an
important
matter
in
a
hurry
just
tell
me
your
home
telephone
number
and
i
ring
up
at
seven
this
evening
for
your
reluctantly
moira
gave
him
the
number
she
was
not
at
all
prejudiced
against
this
carroty
stranger
in
fact
she
had
a
vague
suspicion
that
he
was
a
sure
cure
for
the
blues
an
ailment
which
she
suffered
from
all
too
frequently
and
moreover
his
voice
his
respectful
manner
his
alert
eyes
and
his
wonderful
clothing
were
all
rather
alluring
womanlike
she
was
flattered
at
being
noticed
particularly
by
a
man
like
ogilvy
whom
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
was
vastly
superior
to
any
male
even
in
sequoia
with
the
sole
exception
of
bryce
cardigan
the
flutter
of
a
great
adventure
was
in
moira
heart
and
the
flush
of
a
thousand
roses
in
her
cheeks
when
buck
ogilvy
having
at
length
departed
she
went
into
bryce
private
office
to
get
his
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
of
accepting
the
invitation
bryce
listened
to
her
gravely
as
with
all
the
sweet
innocence
of
her
years
and
unworldliness
she
laid
the
ogilvy
proposition
before
him
by
all
means
accept
he
counselled
her
buck
ogilvy
is
one
of
the
finest
gentlemen
you
ever
meet
i
stake
my
reputation
on
him
you
find
him
vastly
amusing
moira
he
make
niobe
forget
her
troubles
and
he
does
know
how
to
order
a
do
you
think
i
ought
to
have
a
chaperon
well
it
is
necessary
although
it
good
form
in
a
small
town
like
sequoia
where
everybody
knows
everybody
i
thought
so
moira
murmured
thoughtfully
i
ask
miss
sumner
to
come
with
us
ogilvy
wo
mind
the
extra
expense
i
he
be
delighted
bryce
assured
her
maliciously
ask
miss
sumner
by
all
when
moira
had
left
him
bryce
sighed
gosh
he
murmured
i
wish
i
could
go
he
was
roused
from
his
bitter
introspections
presently
by
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
to
his
amazement
shirley
sumner
was
calling
him
you
a
wee
bit
surprised
are
you
cardigan
she
said
teasingly
i
am
he
answered
honestly
i
had
a
notion
i
was
quite
persona
non
grata
with
are
you
relieved
to
find
you
are
not
you
are
you
thank
you
i
am
i
suppose
you
wondering
why
i
have
telephoned
to
you
no
i
have
had
time
the
suddenness
of
it
all
has
left
me
more
or
less
dumb
why
did
you
ring
up
i
wanted
some
advice
suppose
you
wanted
very
very
much
to
know
what
two
people
were
talking
about
but
found
yourself
in
a
position
where
you
could
eavesdrop
what
would
you
do
i
would
eavesdrop
he
told
her
severely
that
is
a
nice
thing
to
do
and
i
did
think
you
would
contemplate
anything
that
i
would
ordinarily
but
i
have
every
moral
ethical
and
financial
right
to
be
a
party
to
that
conversation
only
well
with
you
present
there
would
be
no
conversation
is
that
it
exactly
and
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
you
should
know
what
is
said
and
you
do
not
intend
to
use
your
knowledge
of
this
conversation
when
gained
for
an
illegal
or
unethical
purpose
i
do
not
on
the
contrary
if
i
am
aware
of
what
is
being
planned
i
can
prevent
others
from
doing
something
illegal
and
in
that
event
shirley
i
should
say
you
are
quite
justified
in
but
how
can
i
do
it
i
ca
hide
in
a
closet
and
buy
a
dictograph
and
have
it
hidden
in
the
room
where
the
conversation
takes
place
it
will
record
every
word
of
where
can
i
buy
one
in
san
will
you
telephone
to
your
san
francisco
office
and
have
them
buy
one
for
me
and
ship
it
to
you
together
with
directions
for
using
george
sea
otter
can
bring
it
over
to
me
when
it
shirley
this
is
most
i
quite
realize
that
may
i
depend
upon
you
to
oblige
me
in
this
matter
certainly
but
why
pick
on
me
of
all
persons
to
perform
such
a
mission
for
you
i
can
trust
you
to
forget
that
you
have
performed
thank
you
i
think
you
may
safely
trust
me
and
i
shall
attend
to
the
matter
you
are
very
kind
cardigan
how
is
your
dear
old
father
moira
told
me
sometime
ago
that
he
was
he
quite
well
again
thank
you
by
the
way
moira
does
know
that
you
and
i
have
ever
met
why
do
you
tell
her
i
ca
answer
that
question
now
perhaps
some
day
i
may
be
in
a
position
to
do
it
too
bad
the
circumstances
are
such
that
we
who
started
out
to
be
such
agreeable
friends
see
so
little
of
each
other
indeed
it
is
however
it
all
your
fault
i
have
told
you
once
how
you
can
obviate
that
distressing
situation
but
you
so
stubborn
i
have
got
to
the
point
where
i
like
crawling
on
my
hands
and
knees
he
flared
back
at
her
even
for
your
sake
i
decline
to
simulate
friendship
or
tolerance
for
your
uncle
hence
i
must
be
content
to
let
matters
stand
as
they
are
between
she
laughed
lightly
so
you
are
still
uncompromisingly
belligerent
still
after
uncle
seth
scalp
yes
and
i
think
i
going
to
get
it
at
any
rate
he
is
going
to
get
do
you
think
you
rather
unjust
to
make
me
suffer
for
the
sins
of
my
relative
bryce
she
demanded
she
had
called
him
by
his
first
name
he
thrilled
i
lost
in
a
quagmire
of
debts
i
helpless
now
he
murmured
i
not
fighting
for
myself
alone
but
for
a
thousand
dependents
for
a
principle
for
an
ancient
sentiment
that
was
my
father
and
is
now
mine
you
do
not
i
understand
more
than
you
give
me
credit
for
and
some
day
realize
it
i
understand
just
enough
to
make
me
feel
sorry
for
you
i
understand
what
even
my
uncle
does
suspect
at
present
and
that
is
that
you
the
directing
genius
of
the
northern
california
oregon
railroad
and
hiding
behind
your
friend
ogilvy
now
listen
to
me
bryce
cardigan
you
never
going
to
build
that
road
do
you
understand
the
suddenness
of
her
attack
amazed
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
contradict
her
instead
he
blurted
out
angrily
and
defiantly
i
build
that
road
if
it
costs
me
my
life
if
it
costs
me
you
understand
i
in
this
fight
to
you
will
not
build
that
road
she
reiterated
why
because
i
shall
not
permit
you
to
i
have
some
financial
interest
in
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
and
it
is
not
to
that
financial
interest
that
you
should
build
the
how
did
you
find
out
i
was
behind
ogilvy
intuition
then
i
accused
you
of
it
and
you
admitted
i
suppose
you
going
to
tell
your
uncle
now
he
retorted
witheringly
on
the
contrary
i
am
not
i
greatly
fear
i
was
born
with
a
touch
of
sporting
blood
cardigan
so
i
going
to
let
you
two
fight
until
you
exhausted
and
then
i
going
to
step
in
and
decide
the
issue
you
can
save
money
by
surrendering
now
i
hold
the
whip
i
prefer
to
fight
with
your
permission
this
bout
will
go
to
a
i
not
so
certain
i
do
not
like
you
all
the
more
for
that
decision
and
if
it
will
comfort
you
the
least
bit
you
have
my
word
of
honour
that
i
shall
not
reveal
to
my
uncle
the
identity
of
the
man
behind
the
i
not
a
tattletale
you
know
and
moreover
i
have
a
great
curiosity
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
story
the
fact
is
both
you
and
uncle
seth
annoy
me
exceedingly
how
lovely
everything
would
have
been
if
you
two
had
started
this
feud
and
forced
upon
me
the
task
of
trying
to
be
fair
and
impartial
to
you
can
you
remain
fair
and
impartial
i
think
i
can
even
up
to
the
point
of
deciding
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
build
that
road
then
i
shall
act
independently
of
you
both
forgive
my
slang
but
i
going
to
hand
you
each
a
poke
shirley
he
told
her
earnestly
listen
carefully
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
i
love
you
i
loved
you
from
the
day
i
first
met
you
i
shall
always
love
you
and
when
i
get
around
to
it
i
going
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
at
present
however
that
is
a
right
i
do
not
possess
however
the
day
i
acquire
the
right
i
shall
exercise
and
when
will
that
day
be
very
softly
in
awesome
tones
the
day
i
drive
the
last
spike
in
the
fell
a
silence
then
i
glad
bryce
cardigan
you
not
a
quitter
good
luck
and
do
forget
my
she
hung
up
and
sat
at
the
telephone
for
a
moment
dimpled
chin
in
dimpled
hand
her
glance
wandering
through
the
window
and
far
away
across
the
roofs
of
the
town
to
where
the
of
cardigan
mill
cut
the
how
hate
you
if
i
could
handle
you
she
murmured
following
this
exasperating
but
illuminating
conversation
with
shirley
sumner
over
the
telephone
bryce
cardigan
was
a
distressed
and
badly
worried
man
however
bryce
was
a
communicant
of
a
very
simple
faith
to
wit
that
one
is
never
whipped
till
one
is
counted
out
and
the
first
shock
of
shirley
discovery
having
passed
he
wasted
no
time
in
vain
repinings
but
straightway
set
himself
to
scheme
a
way
out
of
his
dilemma
for
an
hour
he
sat
slouched
in
his
chair
chin
on
breast
the
while
he
reviewed
every
angle
of
the
situation
he
found
it
impossible
however
to
dissociate
the
business
from
the
personal
aspects
of
his
relations
with
shirley
and
he
recalled
that
she
had
the
very
best
of
reasons
for
placing
their
relations
on
a
business
basis
rather
than
a
sentimental
one
he
had
played
a
part
in
their
little
drama
which
he
knew
must
have
baffled
and
infuriated
her
more
had
she
in
those
delightful
few
days
of
their
early
acquaintance
formed
for
him
a
sentiment
somewhat
stronger
than
friendship
he
did
not
flatter
himself
that
this
was
so
he
could
understand
her
attitude
toward
him
as
that
of
the
woman
scorned
for
the
present
however
it
was
all
a
profound
and
disturbing
mystery
and
after
an
hour
of
futile
concentration
there
came
to
bryce
the
old
childish
impulse
to
go
to
his
father
with
his
troubles
that
sturdy
old
soul
freed
from
the
hot
passions
of
youth
its
impetuosity
and
its
proneness
to
consider
cause
rather
than
effect
had
weathered
too
many
storms
in
his
day
to
permit
the
present
one
to
benumb
his
brain
as
it
had
his
son
he
will
be
able
to
think
without
having
his
thoughts
blotted
out
by
a
woman
face
bryce
soliloquized
he
like
one
of
his
own
big
redwood
trees
his
head
is
always
above
the
straightway
bryce
left
the
office
and
went
home
to
the
old
house
on
the
knoll
john
cardigan
was
sitting
on
the
veranda
and
from
a
stand
beside
him
george
sea
otter
entertained
him
with
a
phonograph
selection
the
suwanee
river
sung
by
a
male
quartet
as
the
gate
clicked
john
raised
his
head
then
as
bryce
quick
step
spurned
the
cement
walk
up
the
little
garden
he
rose
and
stood
with
one
hand
outstretched
and
trembling
a
little
he
could
not
see
but
with
the
intuition
of
the
blind
he
knew
what
is
it
son
he
demanded
gently
as
bryce
came
up
the
low
steps
george
choke
that
contraption
bryce
took
his
father
hand
i
in
trouble
john
cardigan
he
said
simply
and
i
not
big
enough
to
handle
it
the
leonine
old
man
smiled
and
his
smile
had
all
the
sweetness
of
a
benediction
his
boy
was
in
trouble
and
had
come
to
him
good
then
he
would
not
fail
him
sit
down
son
and
tell
the
old
man
all
about
it
begin
at
the
beginning
and
let
me
have
all
the
angles
of
the
bryce
obeyed
and
for
the
first
time
john
cardigan
learned
of
his
acquaintance
with
shirley
sumner
and
the
fact
that
she
had
been
present
in
pennington
woods
the
day
bryce
had
gone
there
to
settle
the
score
with
jules
rondeau
in
the
wonderful
first
flush
of
his
love
a
sense
of
embarrassment
following
his
discovery
of
the
fact
that
his
father
and
colonel
pennington
were
implacable
enemies
had
decided
bryce
not
to
mention
the
matter
of
the
girl
to
john
cardigan
until
the
entente
cordiale
between
pennington
and
his
father
could
be
reestablished
for
bryce
had
with
the
optimism
of
his
years
entertained
for
a
few
days
a
thought
that
he
could
bring
about
this
desirable
condition
of
affairs
the
discovery
that
he
could
not
together
with
his
renunciation
of
his
love
until
he
should
succeed
in
protecting
his
heritage
and
eliminating
the
despair
that
had
come
upon
his
father
in
the
latter
old
age
had
further
operated
to
render
unnecessary
any
discussion
of
the
girl
with
the
old
man
with
the
patience
and
gentleness
of
a
confessor
john
cardigan
heard
the
story
now
and
though
bryce
gave
no
hint
in
words
that
his
affections
were
involved
in
the
fight
for
the
cardigan
acres
yet
did
his
father
know
it
for
he
was
a
parent
and
his
great
heart
went
out
in
sympathy
for
his
boy
i
understand
sonny
i
understand
this
young
lady
is
only
one
additional
reason
why
you
must
win
for
of
course
you
understand
she
is
not
indifferent
to
i
do
not
know
that
she
feels
for
me
anything
stronger
than
a
vagrant
sympathy
dad
for
while
she
is
eternally
feminine
nevertheless
she
has
a
masculine
way
of
looking
at
many
things
she
is
a
good
comrade
with
a
bully
sense
of
sportsmanship
and
unlike
her
skunk
of
an
uncle
she
fights
in
the
open
under
the
circumstances
however
her
first
loyalty
is
to
him
in
fact
she
owes
none
to
me
and
i
dare
say
he
has
given
her
some
extremely
plausible
reason
why
we
should
be
eliminated
while
i
think
she
is
sorry
that
it
must
be
done
nevertheless
in
a
mistaken
impulse
of
she
is
likely
to
let
him
do
perhaps
perhaps
one
never
knows
why
a
woman
does
things
although
it
is
a
safe
bet
that
if
they
with
you
at
all
they
with
you
all
the
way
eliminate
the
girl
my
boy
she
trying
to
play
fair
to
you
and
her
relative
let
us
concentrate
on
the
entire
situation
hinges
on
that
of
his
tracks
on
water
he
does
know
you
plan
to
cross
them
does
he
then
lad
your
job
is
to
get
your
crossing
in
before
he
finds
out
is
it
yes
but
it
is
an
impossible
task
partner
i
not
aladdin
you
know
i
have
to
have
a
franchise
from
the
city
council
and
i
have
to
have
both
are
procurable
my
son
induce
the
city
council
to
grant
you
a
temporary
franchise
and
buy
your
rails
from
pennington
he
has
a
mile
of
track
running
up
laurel
creek
and
laurel
creek
was
logged
out
three
years
ago
i
believe
that
spur
is
useless
to
pennington
and
the
rails
are
rusting
but
will
he
sell
them
to
me
not
if
you
tell
him
why
you
want
but
he
hates
me
old
the
colonel
never
permits
sentiment
to
interfere
with
business
my
son
he
does
need
the
rails
and
he
does
desire
your
money
consider
the
how
do
you
stand
with
the
mayor
and
the
council
i
do
not
stand
at
all
i
opposed
poundstone
for
the
office
dobbs
who
was
appointed
to
fill
a
vacancy
caused
by
the
death
of
a
regularly
elected
councilman
was
once
a
bookkeeper
in
our
office
you
will
remember
i
discharged
him
for
looting
the
drawer
andrews
and
mullin
are
professional
politicians
and
not
to
be
trusted
in
fact
poundstone
dobbs
andrews
and
mullin
are
known
as
the
solid
four
yates
and
thatcher
the
remaining
members
of
the
city
council
are
the
result
of
the
reform
ticket
last
fall
but
since
they
are
in
the
minority
they
are
that
makes
it
not
at
all
the
cardigans
are
not
known
to
be
connected
with
the
o
send
your
bright
friend
ogilvy
after
that
franchise
he
the
only
man
who
can
land
it
give
him
a
free
hand
and
tell
him
to
deliver
the
goods
by
any
means
short
of
bribery
i
imagine
he
had
experience
with
city
councils
and
will
know
exactly
how
to
proceed
i
know
you
can
procure
the
rails
and
have
them
at
the
intersection
of
b
and
water
streets
thursday
night
if
ogilvy
can
procure
the
temporary
franchise
and
have
it
in
his
pocket
by
six
thursday
night
you
should
have
that
crossing
in
by
sunup
friday
morning
then
let
pennington
rave
he
can
not
procure
an
injunction
to
restrain
us
from
cutting
his
tracks
thus
throwing
the
matter
into
the
courts
and
holding
us
up
indefinitely
because
by
the
time
he
wakes
up
the
tracks
will
have
been
cut
the
best
he
can
do
then
will
be
to
fight
us
before
the
city
council
when
we
apply
for
our
permanent
franchise
thank
god
however
the
name
of
cardigan
carries
weight
in
this
county
and
with
the
pressure
of
public
sympathy
and
opinion
back
of
us
we
may
venture
my
boy
to
break
a
lance
with
the
solid
four
should
they
stand
with
partner
it
looks
like
a
forlorn
hope
said
bryce
well
you
the
boy
to
lead
it
and
it
will
cost
but
little
to
put
in
the
crossing
and
take
a
chance
remember
bryce
once
we
have
that
crossing
in
it
stands
like
a
between
pennington
and
the
law
which
he
knows
so
well
how
to
pervert
to
suit
his
ignoble
he
turned
earnestly
to
bryce
and
waved
a
trembling
admonitory
finger
your
job
is
to
keep
out
of
court
once
pennington
gets
the
law
on
us
the
issue
will
not
be
settled
in
our
favour
for
years
and
in
the
meantime
you
perish
run
along
now
and
hunt
up
ogilvy
george
play
that
river
quartet
again
it
sort
o
soothes
chapter
xxv
it
was
with
a
considerably
lighter
heart
that
bryce
returned
to
the
from
which
he
lost
no
time
in
summoning
buck
ogilvy
by
telephone
thanks
so
much
for
the
invitation
ogilvy
murmured
gratefully
be
down
in
a
pig
and
he
was
bryce
you
look
like
the
devil
he
declared
the
moment
he
entered
the
latter
private
office
i
ought
to
buck
i
just
raised
the
devil
and
spilled
the
beans
on
the
to
whom
when
and
where
to
pennington
niece
over
the
telephone
about
two
hours
buck
ogilvy
smote
his
left
palm
with
his
right
fist
and
you
waited
two
hours
to
confess
your
crime
zounds
man
this
is
i
know
curse
me
buck
i
probably
talked
you
out
of
a
good
oh
say
not
so
old
settler
we
may
still
have
an
out
how
did
you
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
that
remarkable
girl
called
me
up
and
accused
you
of
being
a
mere
screen
for
me
and
amazed
me
so
i
admitted
ogilvy
dropped
his
red
head
in
simulated
agony
and
moaned
presently
he
raised
it
and
said
well
it
might
have
been
worse
think
of
what
might
have
happened
had
she
called
in
person
she
would
have
picked
your
pocket
for
the
corporate
seal
the
combination
of
the
safe
and
the
list
of
stockholders
and
probably
ended
up
by
gagging
you
and
binding
you
in
your
own
do
buck
comfort
and
not
abuse
is
what
i
need
all
right
i
conclude
my
remarks
by
stating
that
i
regard
you
as
a
lovable
devoid
of
sufficient
mental
energy
to
pound
the
proverbial
sand
into
the
proverbial
now
then
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
to
save

its
intersection

all
accounts

bryce
almost
roared
why

girl
that
bluffed
the
secret
of
the
out
of
me
do
you
hate
her
for
it
no

to
keep
up
appearances
any
longer
meet
me
at
the
canton
at
seven
and
check
dull
care
at
the
and
before
bryce
could
protest
ogilvy
had
thrown
open
the
office
door
and
called
the
glad
tidings
to
moira
who
was
working
in
the
next
room
whereupon
moira
wonderful
eyes
shone
with
that
strange
lambent
flame
she
clasped
her
hands
joyously
oh
how
wonderful
she
exclaimed
always
wanted
miss
shirley
to
meet
again
bryce
was
moved
to
protest
but
buck
ogilvy
reached
around
the
door
and
kicked
him
in
the
shins
do
crab
my
game
you
miserable
detract
one
speck
from
that
girl
pleasure
and
you
never
see
that
temporary
franchise
he
threatened
i
will
not
work
for
a
quitter
so
there
and
with
his
bright
smile
he
set
out
immediately
upon
the
trail
of
the
city
council
leaving
bryce
cardigan
a
prey
to
many
conflicting
emotions
the
chief
of
which
for
all
that
he
strove
to
suppress
it
was
riotous
joy
in
the
knowledge
that
while
he
had
fought
against
it
fate
had
decreed
that
he
should
bask
once
more
in
the
radiance
of
shirley
sumner
adorable
presence
presently
for
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
moira
heard
him
whistling
turkey
in
the
chapter
xxvi
fortunately
for
the
situation
which
had
so
suddenly
confronted
him
bryce
cardigan
had
buck
ogilvy
and
out
of
the
experiences
gained
in
other
enterprises
the
said
ogilvy
while
startled
was
not
stunned
by
the
suddenness
and
immensity
of
the
order
so
casually
given
him
by
his
youthful
employer
for
he
had
already
devoted
to
the
matter
of
that
crossing
the
better
part
of
the
preceding
night
also
he
had
investigated
indexed
and
the
city
council
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
how
great
or
how
little
would
be
the
effort
he
must
devote
to
obtaining
from
it
the
coveted
franchise
got
to
run
a
sandy
on
the
mayor
buck
soliloquized
as
he
walked
rapidly
uptown
and
i
have
to
be
mighty
slick
about
it
too
or
get
my
fingers
in
the
jam
if
i
get
the
mayor
on
my
side
if
i
get
him
to
the
point
where
he
thinks
well
of
me
and
would
like
to
oblige
me
without
prejudicing
himself
financially
or
politically
i
can
get
that
temporary
franchise
now
how
shall
i
proceed
to
sneak
up
on
that
oily
old
cuss
blind
side
two
blocks
farther
on
ogilvy
paused
and
snapped
his
fingers
vigorously
eureka
he
murmured
i
got
poundstone
by
the
tail
on
a
downhill
haul
is
it
a
cinch
well
i
just
guess
i
should
tell
a
man
he
hurried
to
the
telephone
building
and
put
in
a
call
for
the
san
francisco
office
of
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
when
the
manager
came
on
the
line
ogilvy
dictated
to
him
a
message
which
he
instructed
the
manager
to
telegraph
back
to
him
at
the
hotel
sequoia
one
hour
later
this
mysterious
detail
attended
to
he
continued
on
to
the
mayor
office
in
the
city
hall
mayor
poundstone
bushy
eyebrows
arched
with
interest
when
his
secretary
laid
upon
his
desk
the
card
of
buchanan
ogilvy
and
general
manager
of
the
northern
california
oregon
railroad
he
breathed
with
an
unpleasant
resemblance
to
a
bon
vivant
who
sees
before
him
his
favourite
vintage
i
have
been
expecting
ogilvy
to
call
for
quite
a
while
at
last
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
show
him
the
visitor
was
accordingly
admitted
to
the
great
man
presence
and
favoured
with
an
official
handshake
of
great
heartiness
i
been
hoping
to
have
this
pleasure
for
quite
some
time
poundstone
buck
announced
easily
as
he
disposed
of
his
hat
and
overcoat
on
an
adjacent
chair
but
unfortunately
i
have
had
so
much
preliminary
detail
to
attend
to
before
making
an
official
call
that
at
last
i
grew
discouraged
and
concluded
i
just
drop
in
informally
and
get
alert
blue
eyes
opened
wide
in
sympathy
with
his
genial
mouth
to
deluge
mayor
poundstone
with
a
smile
that
was
friendly
guileless
confidential
and
singularly
delightful
ogilvy
was
a
man
possessed
of
tremendous
personal
magnetism
when
he
chose
to
exert
it
and
that
smile
was
ever
the
opening
gun
of
his
magnetic
bombardment
for
it
was
a
smile
that
always
had
the
effect
of
making
the
observer
desire
to
behold
it
again
of
disarming
suspicion
and
establishing
confidence
glad
you
did
mighty
glad
the
mayor
cried
heartily
we
have
all
of
course
heard
of
your
great
plans
and
are
naturally
anxious
to
hear
more
of
them
in
the
hope
that
we
can
do
all
that
anybody
reasonably
and
legally
can
to
promote
your
enterprise
and
incidentally
our
own
since
we
are
not
insensible
to
the
advantages
which
will
accrue
to
this
county
when
it
is
connected
by
rail
with
the
outside
that
extremely
broad
view
is
most
encouraging
buck
chirped
and
he
showered
the
mayor
with
another
smile
reciprocity
is
the
watchword
of
progress
i
might
state
however
that
while
you
humboldters
are
fully
alive
to
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
a
feeder
to
a
transcontinental
road
my
associates
and
myself
are
not
insensible
of
the
fact
that
the
success
of
our
enterprise
depends
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
city
of
sequoia
shall
cooperate
with
us
and
since
you
are
the
chief
executive
of
the
city
naturally
i
have
come
to
you
to
explain
our
plans
i
have
read
your
articles
of
incorporation
ogilvy
mayor
poundstone
boomed
paternally
you
will
recall
that
they
were
published
in
the
sequoia
sentinel
it
strikes
me
then
you
know
exactly
what
we
purpose
doing
and
any
further
explanation
would
be
superfluous
buck
interrupted
amiably
glad
to
dispose
of
the
matter
so
promptly
again
he
favoured
the
mayor
with
his
bright
smile
and
the
latter
now
fully
convinced
that
here
was
a
young
man
of
vast
emprise
whom
it
behooved
him
to
receive
in
a
and
manner
nodded
vigorous
approval
well
that
being
the
case
ogilvy
he
continued
what
can
we
sequoians
do
to
make
you
happy
why
to
begin
with
poundstone
you
might
accept
my
solemn
assurances
that
despite
the
skepticism
which
for
some
unknown
reason
appears
to
shroud
our
enterprise
in
the
minds
of
some
people
we
have
incorporated
a
railroad
company
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
railroad
we
purpose
commencing
grading
operations
in
the
very
near
future
and
the
only
thing
that
can
possibly
interfere
with
the
project
will
be
the
declination
of
the
city
council
to
grant
us
a
franchise
to
run
our
line
through
the
city
to
he
handed
his
to
mayor
poundstone
and
continued
lightly
and
i
am
glad
to
have
your
assurance
that
the
city
council
will
not
drop
a
cold
chisel
in
the
cogs
of
the
wheels
of
poundstone
had
given
no
such
assurance
but
for
some
reason
he
did
not
feel
equal
to
the
task
of
contradicting
this
pleasant
fellow
ogilvy
continued
at
the
proper
time
we
shall
apply
for
the
franchise
it
will
then
be
time
enough
to
discuss
it
in
the
meantime
the
plans
a
public
dedicatory
ceremony
at
the
first
breaking
of
ground
and
i
would
be
greatly
honoured
mayor
if
you
would
consent
to
turn
the
first
shovelful
of
earth
and
deliver
the
address
of
welcome
upon
that
the
mayor
swelled
like
a
thanksgiving
turkey
the
honour
will
be
mine
he
corrected
his
visitor
thank
you
so
much
sir
well
that
another
worry
off
my
with
the
tact
of
a
prime
minister
buck
then
proceeded
deliberately
to
shift
the
conversation
to
the
weather
and
asked
a
number
of
questions
anent
the
annual
rainfall
then
he
turned
to
crops
finance
and
national
politics
and
gradually
veered
around
to
an
artistic
of
the
vast
expansion
of
the
industry
when
the
should
be
connected
by
rail
with
the
markets
of
the
entire
country
he
spoke
of
the
magic
effect
the
building
of
such
a
line
would
have
upon
the
growth
of
sequoia
sequoia
he
felt
convinced
was
destined
to
become
a
city
of
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
he
rhapsodized
over
the
progressive
spirit
of
the
community
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
studded
the
waters
of
humboldt
bay
with
the
masts
of
the
shipping
suddenly
he
checked
himself
glanced
at
his
watch
apologized
for
consuming
so
much
of
his
honour
valuable
time
expressed
himself
felicitated
at
knowing
the
mayor
gracefully
expressed
his
appreciation
for
the
encouragement
given
his
enterprise
and
departed
when
he
had
gone
mayor
poundstone
declared
to
his
secretary
that
without
doubt
ogilvy
was
the
livest
keenest
fellow
that
had
struck
sequoia
since
the
advent
of
old
john
cardigan
half
an
hour
later
the
mayor
rang
buck
ogilvy
was
on
the
line
i
beg
your
pardon
for
bothering
you
with
my
affairs
twice
in
the
same
day
mayor
he
announced
deprecatingly
but
the
fact
is
a
condition
has
just
arisen
which
necessitates
the
immediate
employment
of
an
attorney
the
job
is
not
a
very
important
one
and
almost
any
lawyer
would
do
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
must
sooner
or
later
employ
an
attorney
to
look
after
our
interests
locally
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
as
well
make
the
selection
of
a
permanent
attorney
now
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
city
poundstone
would
it
be
imposing
on
your
consideration
if
i
asked
you
to
recommend
such
a
person
why
not
at
all
not
at
all
delighted
to
help
you
ogilvy
let
me
see
now
there
are
several
attorneys
in
sequoia
all
men
of
excellent
ability
and
unimpeachable
integrity
whom
i
can
recommend
with
the
utmost
pleasure
cadman

up

of

to
henry
henry
poundstone
junior
proved
to
be
the
sole
inhabitant
of
one
rather
bare
office
in
the
cardigan
block
buck
had
fully
resolved
to
give
him
a
retainer
of
a
thousand
dollars
or
even
more
if
he
asked
for
it
but
after
one
look
at
henry
he
cut
the
appropriation
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
young
poundstone
was
blonde
and
frail
with
large
round
spectacles
rabbit
teeth
and
the
swiftly
receding
chin
of
the
terrapin
moreover
he
was
in
such
a
flutter
of
anticipation
over
the
arrival
of
his
client
that
buck
deduced
two
things
to
wit
that
the
mayor
had
telephoned
henry
he
was
apt
to
have
a
client
and
that
as
a
result
of
this
miracle
henry
was
in
no
fit
state
to
discuss
the
sordid
subject
of
fees
and
retainers
ergo
ogilvy
decided
to
obviate
such
discussion
now
or
in
the
future
he
handed
henry
a
check
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
which
he
wrote
out
on
the
spot
and
with
his
bright
winning
smile
remarked
now
poundstone
we
will
proceed
to
business
that
retainer
is
a
large
one
i
admit
but
neither
is
the
job
i
have
for
you
later
if
need
of
your
services
on
a
larger
scale
should
develop
we
shall
of
course
expect
to
make
a
new
arrangement
whereby
you
will
receive
the
customary
retainer
of
all
of
our
corporation
attorneys
i
trust
that
is
quite
eminently
so
gasped
the
young
disciple
of
blackstone
very
well
then
let
us
proceed
to
buck
removed
from
a
small
leather
bag
a
bale
of
documents
i
have
here
he
announced
agreements
from
landowners

within
one
year
from
date
satisfactory
deeds
covering
rights

which
are
minutely
described
in

i

these
deeds
prepared

signing

at
the
earliest
possible
you
shall
have
them
at
this
time
henry

the
head
of
henry
poundstone
junior
was
held
high
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
flung
forth
his
modest
shingle
to
the
breezes
of
sequoia
six
months
before
and
there
was
an
unaccustomed
gleam
of
importance
in
his
pale
eyes
as
he
rushed
into
big
father
office
in
the
city
hall
by
jinks
dad
he
exulted
i
hooked
a
fish
at
last
and
he
a
omit
the
cheers
my
boy
remember
i
sent
that
fish
to
you
his
father
answered
with
a
bland
and
indulgent
smile
what
are
you
doing
for
ogilvy
and
how
large
a
retainer
did
he
give
you
i
making
out
deeds
to
his
rights
of
way
ordinarily
it
about
a
job
but
without
waiting
to
discuss
finances
he
handed
me
out
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
why
dad
that
more
than
you
make
in
a
month
from
your
job
as
well
that
is
a
bad
retainer
it
an
opening
wedge
however
it
would
be
mere
in
san
read
this
henry
urged
and
thrust
a
yellow
under
the

the

adjusted
his
glasses

this

the

dated
that
day
and
addressed
to
buchanan

hotel
sequoia

also
with
a
keen
eye
to
minor
details
lie
noted
that
it
had
been
filed
at
san
francisco
subsequent
to
ogilvy
visit
to
him
that
afternoon
breathed
his
honour
that
accounts
for
his
failure
to
bring
the
matter
up
at
our
interview
upon
his
return
to
the
hotel
he
found
this
telegram
and
got
busy
at
once
by
jupiter
this
looks
like
business
henry
how
did
you
come
into
possession
of
this
telegram
it
must
have
been
mixed
up
in
the
documents
ogilvy
left
with
me
i
found
it
on
my
desk
when
i
was
sorting
out
the
papers
and
in
my
capacity
of
attorney
for
the
i
had
no
hesitancy
in
reading
well
i
do
declare
wonder
who
hockley
is
never
heard
of
that
fellow
in
connection
with
the
hockley
does
matter
young
henry
declared
triumphantly
although
i
bet
a
hat
he
one
of
those
wall
street
fellows
and
one
of
probably
of
course
is
the
man
who
the
devil
is
henry
smiled
tolerantly
upon
his
ignorant
and
guileless
parent
well
how
would
pierpont
morgan
do
for
a
guess
he
queried
hell
bells
and
mayor
poundstone
started
as
if
i
should
say
you
have
hooked
a
big
fish
boy
landed
a
whale
and
the
mayor
whistled
softly
in
his
amazement
and
delight
by
golly
to
think
of
you
getting
in
with
that
bunch
tremendyous
did
ogilvy
say
anything
about
future
business
he
did
said
if
i
proved
satisfactory
he
would
probably
take
me
on
and
pay
the
customary
retainer
given
all
of
their
corporation
well
by
golly
he
better
take
you
on
i
had
a
notion
that
chap
ogilvy
was
smart
enough
to
know
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
on
and
who
does
the
if
i
could
guarantee
ogilvy
that
temporary
franchise
mentioned
in
his
telegram
it
might
help
me
to
get
in
right
with
at
the
start
his
hopeful
suggested
i
guess
it
would
be
kind
of
poor
to
be
taken
on
as
one
of
the
regular
staff
of
attorneys
for
a
morgan
corporation
eh
say
they
pay
those
chaps
as
high
as
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
retainer
guarantee
it
his
father
shouted
guarantee
it
well
i
should
snicker
we
just
show
and
his
crowd
that
they
made
no
mistake
when
they
picked
you
as
their
sequoia
legal
representative
call
a
special
meeting
of
that
little
old
city
council
of
mine
and
jam
that
temporary
franchise
through
while
you
be
saying
robinson
i
tell
you
what
let
do
henry
suggested
i
draw
up
the
temporary
franchise
and
we
put
it
through
at
say
ten
without
saying
a
word
to
ogilvy
about
it
then
when
the
city
clerk
has
signed
and
attested
it
and
put
the
seal
of
the
city
on
it
i
just
casually
take
it
over
to
ogilvy
of
course
he
be
surprised
and
ask
me
how
i
came
to
get
it
and
and
you
look
surprised
his
father
cautioned
sort
of
as
if
you
failed
to
comprehend
what
he
driving
at
make
him
repeat
then
you
say
that
why
that
nothing
ogilvy
i
found
the
telegram
in
those
papers
you
left
with
me
read
it
and
concluded
you
left
it
there
to
give
me
the
dope
so
i
could
go
ahead
and
get
the
franchise
for
you
up
here
whenever
anybody
wants
a
franchise
from
the
city
they
always
hire
an
attorney
to
get
it
for
them
so
i
did
think
anything
about
this
but
just
naturally
went
and
got
it
for
you
if
it
right
why
say
so
and
i
have
it
made
right
old
poundstone
nudged
his
son
in
the
short
ribs
and
winked
drolly
let
him
get
the
idea
you
a
fly
bird
and
on
to
your
leave
it
to
yours
truly
said
henry
his
father
carefully
made
a
copy
of
the
telegram
h
he
grunted
wants
to
cross
water
street
at
b
and
build
out
front
street
well
i
dare
say
nobody
will
kick
over
the
traces
at
that
nothing
but
warehouses
and
yards
along
there
anyhow
still
come
to
think
of
it
pennington
will
probably
raise
a
howl
about
sparks
from
the
engines
of
the
setting
his
lumber
piles
afire
and
he
wo
relish
the
idea
of
that
crossing
because
that
means
a
watchman
and
and
he
have
to
stand
half
the
cost
of
he
be
dead
against
it
henry
declared
i
know
because
at
the
wednesday
meeting
of
the
lumber
manufacturers
association
the
subject
of
the
came
up
and
pennington
made
a
talk
against
it
he
said
the
ought
to
be
discouraged
if
it
was
a
legitimate
enterprise
which
he
doubted
because
the
most
feasible
and
natural
route
for
a
road
would
be
from
willits
mendocino
county
north
to
sequoia
he
said
the
did
tap
the
main
body
of
the
and
that
his
own
road
could
be
extended
to
act
as
a
feeder
to
a
line
that
would
build
in
from
the
south
i
tell
you
he
dead
set
against
then
we
wo
tell
him
anything
about
it
henry
we
just
pull
off
this
special
session
of
the
council
and
forget
to
invite
the
reporters
after
the
job
has
been
put
over
pennington
can
come
around
and
howl
all
he
wants
we
not
letting
a
chance
like
this
slip
by
us
without
grabbing
a
handful
of
the
henry
no
sir
not
if
we
know
you
bet
said
henry
earnestly
and
it
was
even
so
the
entire
council
was
present
with
the
exception
of
thatcher
who
was
home
his
running
mate
yates
was
heartily
in
favour
of
doing
all
and
sundry
of
those
things
which
would
aid
and
encourage
the
building
of
the
railroad
and
offered
no
objection
to
the
motion
to
grant
a
temporary
franchise
however
he
always
played
ball
with
the
absent
thatcher
and
he
was
fairly
well
acquainted
with
his
other
colleagues
on
the
council
where
they
were
concerned
he
was
as
suspicious
as
a
rattlesnake
in
august
in
consequence
of
which
he
considered
it
policy
to
play
safe
pending
thatcher
recovery
rising
in
his
place
he
pointed
out
to
the
board
the
fact
that
many
prominent
citizens
who
yearned
for
such
a
road
as
the
had
warned
him
of
the
danger
of
lending
official
aid
and
comfort
to
a
passel
of
professional
promoters
and
that
after
all
the
might
merely
be
the
to
a
boom
planned
to
unload
the
undesirable
timber
holdings
of
the
trinidad
redwood
lumber
company
in
which
event
it
might
be
well
for
the
council
to
proceed
with
caution
it
was
yates
opinion
that
for
the
present
a
temporary
franchise
for
thirty
days
only
should
be
given
if
during
that
thirty
days
the
exhibited
indubitable
signs
of
activity
he
would
gladly
vote
for
a
extension
to
enable
the
matter
of
a
permanent
franchise
to
be
taken
up
in
regular
order
this
amendment
to
the
original
motion
met
with
the
unqualified
approval
of
the
mayor
as
he
was
careful
to
announce
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
members
of
the
solid
four
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
however
that
he
was
afraid
to
oppose
yates
in
such
a
simple
matter
through
fear
that
yates
might
grow
cantankerous
and
carry
his
troubles
to
the
sequoia
sentinel
a
base
trick
he
had
been
known
to
do
in
the
past
after
explaining
the
advisability
of
keeping
secret
for
the
present
the
fact
that
a
franchise
had
been
granted
his
honour
with
the
consent
of
the
maker
of
the
original
motion
and
the
second
thereof
submitted
the
amended
motion
to
a
vote
which
was
carried
unanimously
at
thursday
morning
therefore
young
henry
poundstone
having
worked
the
greater
part
of
the
previous
night
preparing
the
deeds
delivered
both
deeds
and
franchise
to
buck
ogilvy
at
the
latter
hotel
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
latter
could
conceal
his
tremendous
amazement
when
henry
casually
handed
him
the
franchise
true
he
had
slipped
that
fake
telegram
among
the
contracts
as
bait
for
henry
and
his
father
but
in
his
wildest
flights
of
fancy
had
not
looked
for
them
to
swallow
hook
line
and
sinker
his
fondest
hope
at
the
time
he
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
was
that
henry
would
show
the
telegram
to
his
father
and
thus
inculcate
in
the
old
gentleman
a
friendly
feeling
toward
the
not
unmixed
with
pleasurable
anticipations
of
the
day
when
henry
poundstone
junior
should
be
one
of
the
most
highly
prized
members
of
the
legal
staff
of
a
corporation
when
he
could
control
his
emotions
ogilvy
gazed
approvingly
upon
henry
poundstone
mr
poundstone
he
said
solemnly
i
have
met
some
meteoric
young
attorneys
in
my
day
but
you
the
first
genuine
comet
i
have
seen
in
the
legal
firmament
do
you
mind
telling
me
exactly
how
you
procured
this
franchise
and
why
you
procured
it
without
explicit
orders
from
me
henry
did
his
best
to
look
puzzled
why
he
said
you
left
that
telegram
with
me
and
i
concluded
that
you
regarded
it
as
or
else
had
forgotten
to
mention
it
i
knew
you
were
busy
and
i
did
want
to
bother
you
with
details
so
i
just
went
ahead
and
filled
the
order
for
you
anything
wrong
about
that
certainly
not
it
perfectly
wonderful
but
how
did
you
put
it
over
henry
smirked
my
dad
the
engineer
he
said
bluntly
if
thirty
days
ai
enough
time
see
me
and
i
get
you
thirty
days
more
and
in
the
meantime
nobody
knows
a
thing
about
this
little
deal
what
more
they
wo
know
i
figured
colonel
pennington
might
try
to
block
you
at
that
crossing
so
i
buck
ogilvy
extended
his
hand
in
benediction
and
let
it
drop
lightly
on
henry
poundstone
thin
shoulder
henry
quivered
with
anticipation
under
that
gentle
accolade
and
swallowed
his
heart
while
the
great
ogilvy
made
a
portentous
announcement
my
dear
poundstone
he
said
earnestly
i
am
not
a
man
to
forget
clever
work
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
he
smiled
his
radiant
smile
you
understand
of
course
that
i
am
speaking
for
and
can
make
you
no
firm
promises
however
he
smiled
again
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
you
do
thank
you
said
henry
poundstone
junior
thank
you
ever
so
chapter
xvii
an
experience
extending
over
a
very
active
business
career
of
thirty
years
had
convinced
colonel
seth
pennington
of
the
futility
of
wracking
his
brains
in
vain
speculation
over
mysteries
in
his
day
he
had
been
interested
in
some
small
corporations
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
he
knew
peanut
politics
and
had
learned
that
the
very
best
way
to
fight
the
devil
is
with
fire
frequently
he
had
found
it
of
great
interest
and
profit
to
him
to
know
exactly
how
certain
men
spent
their
time
and
his
money
and
since
he
was
a
very
busy
man
himself
naturally
he
had
to
delegate
somebody
else
to
procure
this
information
for
him
when
therefore
the
northern
california
oregon
railroad
commenced
to
encroach
on
the
colonel
for
sleep
he
realized
that
there
was
but
one
way
in
which
to
conserve
his
rest
and
that
was
by
engaging
to
fathom
the
mystery
for
him
a
specialist
in
the
unravelling
of
mysteries
in
times
gone
by
the
colonel
had
found
a
certain
national
an
extremely
efficient
aid
to
commercial
agencies
and
to
these
tried
and
true
subordinates
he
turned
now
for
explicit
and
satisfying
information
anent
the
northern
california
outrage
the
information
forthcoming
from
dun
and
bradstreet
was
vague
and
unsatisfying
neither
of
these
two
commercial
agencies
could
ascertain
anything
of
interest
regarding
the
finances
of
the
o
for
the
present
the
corporation
had
no
office
its
destinies
in
san
francisco
being
guarded
by
a
attorney
who
had
declined
to
make
any
statement
regarding
the
company
but
promised
one
at
an
early
date
the
board
of
directors
consisted
of
this
attorney
his
two
assistants
his
stenographer
and
buchanan
ogilvy
the
company
had
been
incorporated
for
five
million
dollars
divided
into
five
million
shares
of
par
value
of
one
dollar
each
and
five
shares
had
been
subscribed
both
agencies
forwarded
copies
of
the
articles
of
incorporation
but
since
the
colonel
had
already
read
this
document
in
the
sequoia
sentinel
he
was
not
further
interested
it
looks
fishy
to
me
the
colonel
commented
to
his
manager
and
more
than
ever
convinced
it
a
scheme
of
that
trinidad
redwood
timber
company
to
start
a
and
unload
and
that
is
something
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
does
not
view
with
favour
for
the
reason
that
one
of
these
bright
days
those
trinidad
people
will
come
to
their
senses
and
sell
cheap
to
us
a
slight
extension
of
our
will
make
that
trinidad
timber
accessible
hence
we
are
the
only
logical
customers
and
should
control
the
situation
however
to
be
sure
is
to
be
satisfied

of

and
one
of
the

actually
procured
a
job
as
chainman
with
his
surveying
gang
while
the
other
kept
ogilvy
and
his
secretary
under
surveillance
their
reports
however
yielded
the
colonel
nothing
until
the
first
day
of

to

when
the
following
written
report
caused
the
colonel
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
it
was

he
entered

returned

hurried
to
the

he
was
with
poundstone
until
when
he
returned
leisurely
to

presently

the

alighted
and
entered

returned
at
sharp
accompanied
by
a
young

she
introduced
to

then
driven

found
in
hotel
bar
saw
him
to
bed
at
sharp
needless
to
relate
this
report
had
a
most
amazing
effect
upon
colonel
pennington
and
when
at
length
he
could
recover
his
mental
equilibrium
he
set
about
quite
calmly
to
analyze
the
report
word
by
word
and
sentence
by
sentence
with
the
result
that
he
promptly
arrived
at
the
following
conclusion
his
niece
shirley
sumner
was
not
to
be
trusted
in
so
far
as
young
bryce
cardigan
was
concerned
despite
her
assumption
of
hostility
toward
the
fellow
since
that
memorable
day
in
pennington
woods
the
colonel
was
now
fully
convinced
that
she
had
made
her
peace
with
him
and
had
been
the
recipient
of
his
secret
attentions
right
along
the
colonel
was
on
the
verge
of
calling
his
niece
up
to
demand
an
explanation
but
on
second
thought
decided
to
wait
a
few
days
and
see
what
his
men
might
have
to
report
further
the
was
still
a
mystery
but
a
mystery
in
which
bryce
cardigan
was
interested
moreover
he
was
anxious
to
aid
the
in
every
way
possible
however
the
colonel
could
understand
this
cardigan
would
aid
anything
that
might
possibly
tend
to
lift
the
cardigan
lumber
interests
out
from
under
the
iron
heel
of
colonel
pennington
and
he
was
just
young
enough
and
unsophisticated
enough
to
be
fooled
by
that
trinidad
redwood
timber
gang
the
was
going
to
make
a
mighty
bluff
even
to
the
extent
of
applying
for
a
franchise
to
run
over
the
city
streets
of
sequoia
hence
ogilvy
visit
to
mayor
poundstone
doubtless
on
the
advice
of
bryce
cardigan
hence
also
his
visit
to
young
henry
poundstone
whom
he
had
doubtless
engaged
as
his
legal
representative
in
order
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
young
man
father
coarse
work
ogilvy
had
carried
a
small
leather
bag
to
and
from
henry
poundstone
office
that
bag
was
readily
explained
it
had
contained
a
bribe
in
gold
coin
and
young
henry
had
been
selected
as
the
that
meant
that
mayor
poundstone
had
agreed
to
deliver
the
franchise
for
a
consideration
and
like
the
smooth
scoundrel
he
was
he
wanted
his
bit
in
gold
coin
which
could
not
be
marked
without
the
marks
being
discovered
ogilvy
had
called
first
on
the
mayor
to
arrange
the
details
then
he
had
called
on
the
mayor
son
to
complete
the
transaction
if
a
franchise
had
been
arranged
for
and
the
bribe
already
delivered
that
meant
the
prompt
and
unadvertised
commencement
of
operations
where
the
colonel
asked
himself
would
these
operations
begin
why
close
to
the
waterfront
where
materials
could
be
landed
from
the
steamer
that
brought
them
to
sequoia
at
whose
would
those
materials
be
discharged
why
cardigan
dock
of
course
ogilvy
had
probably
called
first
on
cardigan
to
arrange
that
detail
yes
the
was
going
to
carry
its
monumental
bluff
to
the
point
of
building
a
mile
of
track
through
town
no
no
they
would
spend
that
much
money
on
a
bluff
they
would
bribe
poundstone
unless
the
road
was
meant
and
was
it
a
common
carrier
after
all
had
cardigan
in
some
mysterious
manner
managed
to
borrow
enough
money
to
parallel
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
and
was
he
disguising
it
as
a
common
carrier
the
trail
was
growing
hot
the
colonel
mopped
his
brow
and
concentrated
further
if
the
was
really
going
to
start
operations
in
order
to
move
its
material
from
the
cardigan
dock
to
the
scene
of
operations
it
would
have
to
cut
his
the
colonel
tracks
somewhere
on
water
street
damnation
that
was
it
they
were
trying
to
slip
one
over
on
him
they
were
planning
to
get
a
in
before
he
should
awake
to
the
situation
they
were
planning
too
to
have
the
city
council
slip
through
the
franchise
when
nobody
was
looking
and
once
the
crossing
should
be
in
they
could
laugh
at
colonel
pennington
the
scoundrels
he
murmured
i
on
to
them
cardigan
is
playing
the
game
with
them
that
why
he
bought
those
rails
from
the
old
laurel
creek
spur
oh
the
sly
young
fox
quoting
that
portion
of
our
hauling
contract
which
stipulates
that
all
spurs
and
extensions
of
my
road
once
it
enters
cardigan
lands
must
be
made
at
cardigan
expense
and
all
to
fool
me
into
thinking
he
wanted
those
rails
for
an
extension
of
his
oh
what
a
blithering
idiot
i
have
been
however
not
too
late
yet
poundstone
is
coming
over
to
dinner
thursday
night
and
i
wring
the
swine
dry
before
he
leaves
the
house
and
as
for
those
rails
cardigan
managed
to
hornswoggle
me
out
of
he
seized
the
telephone
and
fairly
shouted
to
his
exchange
operator
to
get
his
jules
rondeau
on
the
line
that
you
rondeau
he
shouted
when

around
and
say

the
colonel
retorted
coolly
it
strikes
me

the
black
minorca
are
rather
slow
playing
even
with
young
rondeau
grunted
i
theenk
mebbe
so
you

yourself
boss
he
replied
enigmatically
and
hung
up
chapter
xviii
the
dictograph
which
shirley
had
asked
bryce
to
obtain
for
her
in
san
francisco
arrived
on
the
regular
on
thursday
morning
and
bryce
called
her
up
to
ask
when
she
desired
it
sent
over
good
morning
cardigan
she
greeted
him
cheerily
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
any
the
worse
for
having
permitted
yourself
to
be
a
human
being
last
night
why
i
feel
pretty
fine
shirley
i
think
it
did
me
a
lot
of
good
to
crawl
out
of
my
shell
last
you
feel
encouraged
to
go
on
living
eh
and
fighting
by
all
then
something
has
occurred
of
late
to
give
you
new
courage
oh
many
things
did
i
give
an
exhibition
of
my
courage
in
accepting
ogilvy
invitation
to
dinner
knowing
you
were
going
to
be
there
she
did
not
like
that
you
carry
your
frankness
to
extremes
my
friend
she
retorted
i
sure
i
always
been
much
nicer
to
you
than
you
nevertheless
there
was
any
valid
reason
why
i
should
tantalize
myself
last
then
why
did
you
come
he
had
a
suspicion
that
she
was
laughing
silently
at
him
partly
to
please
ogilvy
who
has
fallen
head
over
heels
in
love
with
moira
partly
to
please
moira
who
wanted
me
to
meet
you
but
mostly
to
please
myself
because
while
i
dreaded
it
nevertheless
i
wanted
to
see
you
again
i
comforted
myself
with
the
thought
that
for
the
sake
of
appearances
we
dared
not
quarrel
in
the
presence
of
moira
and
my
friend
ogilvy
and
i
dare
say
you
felt
the
same
way
at
any
rate
i
have
seldom
had
more
enjoyment
when
partaking
of
a
meal
with
an
please
do
not
say
that
she
answered
i
am
your
opponent
but
not
your
that
nice
of
you
by
the
way
shirley
you
may
inform
your
uncle
at
breakfast
friday
morning
about
my
connection
with
the
o
in
fact
i
think
it
would
be
far
better
for
you
if
you
made
it
a
point
to
do
why
because
both
ogilvy
and
myself
have
a
very
strong
suspicion
that
your
uncle
has
a
detective
or
two
on
our
trails
there
was
a
strange
man
rather
prevalent
around
him
all
day
yesterday
and
i
noticed
a
fellow
following
my
car
last
night
he
was
on
a
bicycle
and
followed
me
home
i
communicated
my
suspicions
to
ogilvy
and
this
morning
he
spent
two
hours
trying
to
shake
the
same
man
off
his
trail
and
could
so
i
judge
your
uncle
will
learn
that
you
dined
with
ogilvy
moira
and
me
last
oh
dear
that
he
could
sense
her
distress
ashamed
of
having
been
seen
in
my
company
eh
please
do
are
you
quite
serious
in
this
matter
uncle
seth
will
think
it
so
so
he
probably
tell
you
about
it
better
beat
him
to
the
issue
by
up
shirley
doubtless
his
suspicions
are
already
aroused
and
if
you
inform
him
that
you
know
i
am
the
real
builder
of
the
he
think
you
a
smart
woman
and
that
you
been
doing
a
little
private
work
of
your
own
on
behalf
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
which
is
exactly
what
i
have
been
doing
she
reminded
him
i
know
but
then
i
not
afraid
of
you
shirley
that
is
any
more
and
after
friday
morning
i
not
be
afraid
of
your
uncle
do
tell
him
at
breakfast
then
watch
to
see
if
it
affects
his
oh
dear
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
i
believe
you
are
one
your
dictograph
has
arrived
shall
i
send
george
sea
otter
over
with
it
and
have
you
somebody
to
install
it
oh
bother
does
it
have
to
be
installed
it
does
you
place
the
contraption
hide
it
rather
in
the
room
where
the
conspirators
conspire
then
you
run
wires
from
it
into
another
room
where
the
detectives
listen
in
on
the
could
george
sea
otter
install
it
i
think
he
could
there
is
a
printed
card
of
instructions
and
i
dare
say
george
would
find
the
job
no
more
baffling
than
the
on
the
will
he
tell
anybody
not
if
you
ask
him
not
not
even
you
not
even
a
whisper
to
himself
very
well
then
please
send
him
over
thank
you
so
much
bryce
cardigan
you
an
awful
good
old
sort
after
all
really
it
hurts
me
to
have
to
oppose
you
it
would
be
so
much
nicer
if
we
did
have
all
those
redwood
trees
to
protect
would
it
let
us
not
argue
the
question
shirley
i
think
i
have
my
redwood
trees
protected
he
had
scarcely
finished
telephoning
his
home
to
instruct
george
sea
otter
to
report
with
the
express
package
to
shirley
when
buck
ogilvy
strolled
into
the
office
and
tossed
a
document
on
his
desk
your
little
old
temporary
franchise
old
thing
he
announced
and
with
many
a
hearty
laugh
he
related
to
bryce
the
ingenious
means
by
which
he
had
obtained
it
and
now
if
you
will
phone
up
to
your
and
instruct
the
to
lay
off
about
fifty
men
to
rest
for
the
day
pending
a
hard
night
work
and
arrange
to
send
them
down
on
the
last
i
drop
around
after
dinner
and
we
fly
to
that
here
a
list
of
the
tools
we
i
telephone
colonel
pennington
manager
and
ask
him
to
kick
a
in
on
the
laurel
creek
spur
and
snake
those
with
my
rails
aboard
out
to
the
junction
with
the
main
line
bryce
replied
and
he
called
up
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
only
to
be
informed
by
no
less
a
person
than
colonel
pennington
himself
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
send
the
in
until
the
following
afternoon
the
colonel
was
sorry
but
the
was
in
the
shop
having
the
brick
in
her
renewed
while
the
mogul
that
hauled
the
log
trams
would
not
have
time
to
attend
to
the
matter
since
the
flats
would
have
to
be
spotted
on
the
sidetrack
at
cardigan
in
the
woods
and
this
could
not
be
done
until
the
last
loaded
for
the
day
had
been
hauled
out
to
make
room
why
not
switch
back
with
the
mogul
after
the
logtrain
has
been
hauled
out
on
the
main
line
bryce
demanded
pointedly
pennington
however
was
not
trapped
my
dear
fellow
he
replied
patronizingly
quite
impossible
i
assure
you
that
old
trestle
across
the
creek
my
boy
it
has
been
looked
at
for
years
while
i
send
the
light
over
it
and
have
no
fears
i
happen
to
know
colonel
that
the
big
mogul
kicked
those
flats
in
to
load
the
rails
i
know
it
and
what
happened
why
that
old
trestle
squeaked
and
shook
and
gave
every
evidence
of
being
about
to
buckle
in
the
centre
my
engineer
threatened
to
quit
if
i
sent
him
in
very
well
i
suppose
i
have
to
wait
until
the
comes
out
of
the
shop
bryce
replied
resignedly
and
hung
up
he
turned
a
troubled
face
to
ogilvy
checkmated
he
announced
whipped
to
a
frazzle
the
colonel
is
lying
buck
and
i
caught
him
at
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
mogul
did
kick
those
flats
in
at
all
the
did
and
i
know
it
now
i
going
to
send
a
man
over
to
snoop
around
pennington
roundhouse
and
verify
his
report
about
the
being
in
the
he
did
so
half
an
hour
later
the
messenger
returned
with
the
information
that
not
only
was
the
not
in
the
shop
but
her
had
been
overhauled
the
week
before
and
was
reported
to
be
in
excellent
condition
that
settles
it
buck
ogilvy
mourned
he
had
men
on
my
trail
after
all
they
have
reported
and
the
colonel
is
as
suspicious
as
a
rhino
he
does
know
anything
but
he
smells
danger
just
the
exactly
buck
so
he
is
delaying
the
game
until
he
can
learn
something
he
drummed
idly
on
his
desk
for
several
minutes
then
buck
can
you
run
a
locomotive
with
one
hand
old
fine
business
well
i
guess
we
put
in
that
crossing
night
the
will
be
in
the
roundhouse
at
pennington
mill
night
so
we
ca
steal
that
but
we
can
steal
the
mogul
just
send
word
up
to
my
not
to
have
his
train
loaded
when
the
mogul
comes
up
late
afternoon
to
haul
it
down
to
our
he
will
explain
to
the
engineer
and
fireman
that
our
big
bull
donkey
went
out
and
we
could
get
our
logs
down
to
the
landing
in
time
to
get
them
loaded
that
day
of
course
the
bother
to
run
down
to
sequoia
for
the
night
that
is
they
wo
run
the
mogul
down
they
just
leave
her
at
our
all
night
and
put
up
for
the
night
at
our
camp
however
if
they
should
be
forced
because
of
their
private
affairs
to
return
to
sequoia
they
borrow
my
trackwalker
velocipede
i
have
one
that
is
driven
with
a
small
gasolene
engine
i
use
it
in
running
back
and
forth
to
the
in
case
i
fail
to
connect
with
a
but
how
do
you
know
they
will
put
up
at
your
camp
all
night
bryce
my
men
will
make
them
comfortable
and
it
means
they
can
lie
abed
until
seven
instead
of
having
to
roll
out
at
five
which
would
be
the
case
if
they
spent
the
night
at
this
end
of
the
line
if
they
do
not
stay
at
our
the
mogul
will
stay
there
provided
my
lends
them
my
velocipede
the
fireman
would
prefer
that
to
firing
that
big
mogul
all
the
way
back
to
yes
buck
agreed
i
think
he
there
is
a
slight
grade
at
our
i
know
that
because
the
air
leaked
out
of
the
brakes
on
a
i
was
on
a
short
time
ago
and
the
train
ran
away
with
me
now
the
will
set
the
airbrakes
on
the
mogul
and
leave
her
with
steam
up
to
throb
all
night
they
not
blow
her
down
for
that
would
mean
work
firing
her
in
the
morning
our
task
buck
will
be
to
throw
off
the
airbrakes
and
let
her
glide
silently
out
of
our
about
a
mile
down
the
road
stop
get
up
steam
run
down
to
the
junction
with
the
main
line
back
in
on
the
laurel
creek
spur
couple
on
to
those
and
breeze
merrily
down
to
sequoia
with
them
they
be
loaded
waiting
for
us
our
men
will
be
congregated
in
our
just
off
water
street
near
b
waiting
for
us
to
arrive
with
the
rails
and
bingo
we
go
to
it
after
we
drop
the
flats
we
run
the
engine
back
to
the
woods
leave
it
where
we
found
it
return
on
the
velocipede
if
it
there
or
in
my
automobile
if
it
is
there
you
can
get
back
in
ample
time
to
superintend
the
cutting
of
the
crossing
spoken
like
a
man
quoth
buck
ogilvy
you
the
one
man
in
this
world
for
whom
i
steal
a
locomotive
boy
had
either
of
the
conspirators
known
of
pennington
plans
to
entertain
mayor
poundstone
at
dinner
on
thursday
night
it
is
probable
they
would
not
have
cheered
until
those
were
out
of
the
woods
chapter
xxix
mayor
poundstone
and
his
wife
arrived
at
the
pennington
home
in
redwood
boulevard
at
six
thursday
evening
it
was
with
a
profound
feeling
of
relief
that
his
honour
lifted
the
lady
from
their
modest
little
flivver
for
once
inside
the
pennington
house
he
felt
he
would
be
free
from
a
peculiarly
devilish
brand
of
persecution
inaugurated
by
his
wife
about
three
months
previously
poundstone
wanted
a
new
automobile
and
she
had
entered
upon
a
campaign
of
nagging
and
complaint
hoping
to
wear
poundstone
resistance
down
to
the
point
where
he
would
be
willing
to
barter
his
hope
of
salvation
in
return
for
a
guarantee
of
peace
on
earth
i
feel
like
a
perfect
fool
calling
upon
these
people
in
this
filthy
little
rattletrap
poundstone
protested
as
they
passed
up
the
cement
walk
toward
the
pennington
portal
mayor
poundstone
paused
had
he
been
medusa
the
glance
he
bent
upon
his
spouse
would
have
transformed
her
instantly
into
a
not
particularly
symmetrical
statue
of
concrete
he
had
reached
the
in
pity
name
woman
he
growled
talk
about
something
else
give
me
one
night
of
peace
let
me
enjoy
my
dinner
and
this
i
ca
help
it
retorted
with
asperity
she
pointed
to
shirley
sumner
car
parked
under
the
if
i
had
a
sedan
like
that
i
could
die
happy
and
it
only
cost
hundred
and
fifty
i
paid
six
hundred
and
fifty
for
the
rattletrap
and
i
could
afford
that
he
almost
whimpered
you
were
happy
with
it
until
i
was
elected
you
forget
our
social
position
my
dear
she
purred
sweetly
he
could
have
struck
her
hang
your
social
position
he
gritted
savagely
shut
up
will
you
social
position
in
a
sawmill
town
rats
sh
sh
control
yourself
henry
she
plucked
gently
at
his
arm
with
her
other
hand
she
lifted
the
huge
knocker
on
the
front
door
dammit
you
drive
me
crazy
yet
poundstone
gurgled
and
subsided
the
pennington
butler
a
very
superior
person
opened
the
door
and
swept
them
with
a
faintly
disapproving
glance
it
is
possible
that
he
found
mayor
poundstone
who
was
adorned
with
a
white
string
tie
a
soft
slouch
hat
a
prince
albert
coat
and
horseshoe
cut
vest
mildly
amusing
the
poundstones
entered
at
the
entrance
to
the
living
room
the
butler
announced
sonorously
mayor
poundstone
and
glad
to
see
you
aboard
the
ship
colonel
pennington
boomed
with
his
best
air
of
hearty
expansiveness
well
well
he
continued
leading
poundstone
to
a
divan
in
front
of
the
fire
this
is
certainly
delightful
my
niece
will
be
down
in
two
shakes
of
a
lamb
tail
have
a
cigarette
in
the
midst
of
the
commonplace
chatter
incident
to
such
occasions
shirley
entered
the
room
and
the
colonel
leaving
her
to
entertain
the
guests
went
to
a
small
sideboard
in
one
corner
and
brought
forth
the
materials
as
he
jocularly
termed
them
james
appeared
like
magic
with
a
tray
glasses
and
tiny
serviettes
and
the
colonel
elixir
was
passed
to
the
company
to
your
beautiful
eyes
poundstone
was
pennington
debonair
toast
as
he
fixed
green
orbs
with
his
own
poundstone
your
very
good
health
murmured
poundstone
perfectly
and
not
a
bit
strong
have
another
her
hospitable
host
suggested
and
he
poured
it
quite
oblivious
of
the
frightened
wink
which
the
mayor
telegraphed
his
wife
i
will
if
miss
sumner
will
join
me
acquiesced
thanks
i
seldom
drink
a
cocktail
and
one
is
always
my
limit
shirley
replied
smilingly
oh
well
the
colonel
retorted
agreeably
we
make
it
a
festival
poundstone
smoke
they
smoked
up
and
poundstone
prayed
to
his
rather
nebulous
gods
that
would
not
discuss
automobiles
during
the
dinner
alas
the
colonel
cocktails
were
not
unduly
fortified
but
for
all
that
the
two
which
poundstone
had
assimilated
contained
just
sufficient
kick
to
loosen
the
lady
tongue
without
thickening
it
consequently
about
the
time
the
piece
de
resistance
made
its
appearance
she
threw
caution
to
the
winds
and
adverted
to
the
subject
closest
to
her
heart
i
was
telling
henry
as
we
came
up
the
walk
how
greatly
i
envied
you
that
beautiful
sedan
miss
sumner
she
gushed
is
it
a
perfectly
stunning
car
poundstone
made
one
futile
attempt
to
head
her
off
and
i
was
telling
poundstone
he
struck
in
with
a
pathetic
attempt
to
appear
humorous
and
condescending
that
a
little
jitney
was
our
gait
and
that
she
might
as
well
abandon
her
passionate
yearning
for
a
closed
car
angelina
my
dear
something
tells
me
i
going
to
enjoy
this
dinner
a
whole
lot
more
if
you
just
make
up
your
mind
to
be
real
nice
and
resign
yourself
to
the
never
my
dear
she
shook
a
coy
finger
at
him
you
dear
old
tightie
she
cooed
you
do
realize
what
a
closed
car
means
to
a
she
turned
to
shirley
how
an
open
car
does
blow
one
around
my
dear
yes
indeed
said
shirley
innocently
heard
the
mckinnon
people
had
a
man
killed
up
in
their
woods
yesterday
colonel
poundstone
remarked
hoping
against
hope
to
divert
the
conversation
yes
the
fellow
own
fault
pennington
replied
he
was
one
of
those
employees
who
held
to
the
opinion
that
every
man
is
the
captain
of
his
own
soul
and
the
sole
proprietor
of
his
own
body
hence
that
it
behooved
him
to
look
after
both
in
view
of
the
high
cost
of
he
was
warned
that
the
was
weak
at
that
old
splice
and
liable
to
pull
out
of
the
becket
and
sure
enough
it
did
the
free
end
of
the
cable
snapped
back
like
a
whip
and
i
hold
to
the
opinion
poundstone
interrupted
that
if
one
wishes
for
a
thing
hard
enough
and
just
keeps
on
wishing
one
is
bound
to
get
my
dear
said
poundstone
impressively
if
you
would
only
confine
yourself
to
wishing
i
assure
you
your
chances
for
success
would
be
infinitely
there
was
no
mistaking
this
rebuke
even
two
cocktails
were
powerless
to
render
poundstone
oblivious
to
it
shirley
and
her
uncle
saw
the
mayor
lady
flush
slightly
they
caught
the
glint
of
murder
in
his
honour
eye
and
the
keen
intelligence
of
each
warned
them
that
closed
cars
should
be
a
closed
topic
of
conversation
with
the
poundstones
with
the
nicest
tact
in
the
world
shirley
adroitly
changed
the
subject
to
some
tailored
she
had
observed
in
the
window
of
a
local
emporium
that
day
and
poundstone
subsided
about
nine
shirley
in
response
to
a
meaning
glance
from
her
relative
tactfully
convoyed
poundstone
upstairs
leaving
her
uncle
alone
with
his
prey
instantly
pennington
got
down
to
business
well
he
queried
apropos
of
nothing
what
do
you
hear
with
reference
to
the
railroad
oh
the
usual
amount
of
wind
colonel
nobody
knows
what
to
make
of
that
pennington
studied
the
end
of
his
cigar
a
moment
well
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
that
project
either
he
admitted
presently
but
while
it
looks
like
a
fake
i
have
a
suspicion
that
where
there
so
much
smoke
one
is
likely
to
discover
a
little
fire
i
been
waiting
to
see
whether
or
not
they
will
apply
for
a
franchise
to
enter
the
city
but
they
seem
to
be
taking
their
time
about
they
certainly
are
a
deliberate
crowd
the
mayor
murmured
have
they
made
any
move
to
get
a
franchise
pennington
asked
bluntly
if
they
have
i
suppose
you
would
be
the
first
man
to
hear
about
it
i
do
mean
to
be
impertinent
he
added
with
a
gracious
smile
but
the
fact
is
i
noticed
that
windbag
ogilvy
entering
your
office
in
the
city
hall
the
other
afternoon
and
i
could
help
wondering
whether
his
visit
was
social
or
social
so
far
as
i
could
observe
poundstone
replied
truthfully
wondering
just
how
much
pennington
knew
and
rather
apprehensive
that
he
might
get
caught
in
a
lie
before
the
evening
was
over
preliminary
to
the
official
visit
i
dare
the
colonel
puffed
thoughtfully
for
a
while
for
which
the
mayor
was
grateful
since
it
provided
time
in
which
to
organize
himself
suddenly
however
pennington
turned
toward
his
guest
and
fixed
the
latter
with
a
serious
glance
i
had
anticipated
discussing
this
matter
with
you
poundstone
and
you
must
forgive
me
for
it
but
the
fact
is
i
might
as
well
be
frank
with
you
i
am
very
greatly
interested
in
the
operation
of
this
proposed
indeed
financially
yes
but
not
in
the
financial
way
you
think
if
that
railroad
is
built
it
will
have
a
very
distinct
effect
on
my
in
just
what
way
i
am
amazed
you
would
if
you
had
given
the
subject
very
close
consideration
the
logical
route
for
this
railroad
is
from
willits
north
to
sequoia
not
from
sequoia
north
to
grant
pass
oregon
such
a
road
as
the
contemplates
will
tap
about
one
third
of
the
redwood
belt
only
while
a
line
built
in
from
the
south
will
tap
two
thirds
of
it
the
remaining
third
can
be
tapped
by
an
extension
of
my
own
when
my
own
timber
is
logged
out
i
will
want
other
business
for
my
road
and
if
the
parallels
it
i
will
be
left
with
two
streaks
of
rust
on
my
ah
i
perceive
so
it
will
so
it
will
you
agree
with
me
then
poundstone
that
the
is
not
designed
to
foster
the
best
interests
of
the
community
of
course
you
well
i
had
given
the
subject
very
mature
thought
colonel
but
in
the
light
of
your
observations
it
would
appear
that
you
are
quite
of
course
i
am
right
i
take
it
therefore
that
when
the
applies
for
its
franchise
to
run
through
sequoia
neither
you
nor
your
city
council
will
consider
the
proposition
at
i
can
not
of
course
speak
for
the
city
council
poundstone
began
but
pennington
cold
amused
smile
froze
further
utterance
be
frank
with
me
poundstone
i
am
not
a
child
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
this
will
you
exert
every
effort
to
block
that
franchise
in
the
firm
conviction
that
by
so
doing
you
will
accomplish
a
laudable
public
service
poundstone
squirmed
i
should
not
care
at
this
time
to
go
on
record
he
replied
evasively
when
i
have
had
time
to
look
into
the
matter
more
thoroughly
my
dear
man
let
us
not
straddle
the
fence
business
is
a
game
and
so
is
politics
neither
knows
any
sentiment
suppose
you
should
favour
this
crowd
in
a
mistaken
idea
that
you
were
doing
the
right
thing
and
that
subsequently
numberless
developed
the
idea
that
you
had
not
done
your
public
duty
would
some
of
them
not
be
likely
to
invoke
a
recall
election
and
retire
you
and
your
city
council
in
disgrace
i
doubt
if
they
could
defeat
me
i
have
no
such
doubt
pennington
replied
pointedly
poundstone
looked
up
at
him
from
under
lowered
lids
is
that
a
threat
he
demanded
tremulously
my
dear
fellow
threaten
my
guest
pennington
laughed
patronizingly
i
am
giving
you
advice
poundstone
and
rather
good
advice
it
strikes
me
however
while
we
on
the
subject
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
telling
you
that
in
the
event
of
a
disastrous
decision
on
your
part
i
should
not
feel
justified
in
supporting
he
might
with
equal
frankness
have
said
i
would
smash
to
his
guest
his
meaning
was
not
obscure
poundstone
studied
the
pattern
of
the
rug
and
pennington
watching
him
sharply
saw
that
the
man
was
distressed
then
suddenly
one
of
those
brilliant
inspirations
or
flashes
of
rare
intuition
which
had
helped
so
materially
to
fashion
pennington
into
a
captain
of
industry
came
to
him
he
resolved
on
a
bold
stroke
let
not
beat
about
the
bush
poundstone
he
said
with
the
air
of
a
father
patiently
striving
to
induce
his
child
to
recant
a
lie
tell
the
truth
and
save
himself
from
the
parental
wrath
you
been
doing
business
with
ogilvy
i
know
it
for
a
fact
and
you
might
as
well
admit
poundstone
looked
up
red
and
embarrassed
if
i
had
known
he
began
certainly
certainly
i
realize
you
acted
in
perfect
good
faith
you
like
the
majority
of
people
in
sequoia
you
all
so
crazy
for
with
the
outside
world
that
you
jump
at
the
first
plan
that
seems
to
promise
you
one
now
i
as
eager
as
the
others
but
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
railroad
i
for
one
desire
the
right
kind
of
railroad
and
the
is
the
right
kind
that
is
not
for
the
interests
i
represent
have
you
promised
ogilvy
a
franchise
there
was
no
dodging
that
question
a
denial
under
the
present
circumstances
would
be
tantamount
to
an
admission
poundstone
could
not
guess
just
how
much
the
colonel
really
knew
and
it
would
not
do
to
lie
to
him
since
eventually
the
lie
must
be
discovered
caught
between
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
poundstone
only
knew
that
ogilvy
could
never
be
to
him
such
a
powerful
enemy
as
colonel
seth
pennington
so
after
the
fashion
of
his
kind
he
chose
the
lesser
of
two
evils
he
resolved
to
come
the
city
council
has
already
granted
the
a
temporary
franchise
he
confessed
pennington
sprang
furiously
to
his
feet
he
snarled
why
did
you
do
that
without
consulting
me
did
know
you
were
remotely
now
that
the
ice
was
broken
poundstone
felt
relieved
and
was
prepared
to
defend
his
act
vigorously
and
we
did
not
commit
ourselves
irrevocably
he
continued
the
temporary
franchise
will
expire
in
days
and
in
that
short
time
the
can
not
even
get
have
you
any
understanding
as
to
an
extension
of
that
temporary
franchise
in
case
the
desires
it
well
yes
not
in
writing
however
i
gave
ogilvy
to
understand
that
if
he
was
not
ready
in
thirty
days
an
extension
could
readily
be
any
witnesses
i
am
not
such
a
fool
sir
poundstone
declared
with
asperity
i
had
a
notion
i
might
as
well
admit
it
that
you
would
have
serious
objection
to
having
your
tracks
cut
by
a
at
b
and
water
and
for
no
reason
in
life
except
to
justify
himself
and
inculcate
in
pennington
an
impression
that
the
latter
was
dealing
with
a
crafty
and
mayor
poundstone
smiled
boldly
and
knowingly
i
repeat
he
said
that
i
did
not
put
it
in
he
leaned
back
nonchalantly
and
blew
smoke
at
the
ceiling
you
oily
rascal
pennington
soliloquized
you
a
smarter
man
than
i
thought
you
trying
to
play
both
ends
against
the
he
recalled
the
report
of
his
private
detective
and
the
incident
of
ogilvy
visit
to
young
henry
poundstone
office
with
a
small
leather
bag
he
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
this
bag
had
contained
the
bribe
in
gold
coin
which
had
been
productive
of
that
temporary
franchise
and
the
verbal
understanding
for
its
possible
extension
ogilvy
did
business
with
you
through
your
son
henry
he
challenged
poundstone
started
violently
how
much
did
henry
get
out
of
it
pennington
continued
brutally
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
retainer
and
not
a
cent
more
poundstone
protested
virtuously
and
truthfully
you
not
so
good
a
business
man
as
i
gave
you
credit
for
being
the
colonel
retorted
mirthfully
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
oh
lord
poundstone
you
funny
upon
my
word
you
a
and
the
colonel
gave
himself
up
to
a
sincerely
hearty
laugh
you
call
it
a
retainer
he
continued
presently
but
a
grand
jury
might
call
it
something
else
however
he
went
on
after
a
slight
pause
you
not
in
politics
for
your
health
so
let
get
down
to
brass
tacks
how
much
do
you
want
to
deny
the
not
only
an
extension
of
that
temporary
franchise
but
also
a
permanent
franchise
when
they
apply
for
it
poundstone
rose
with
great
dignity
colonel
pennington
sir
he
said
you
insult
sit
down
you
been
insulted
that
way
before
now
shall
we
say
one
thousand
dollars
per
each
for
your
three
good
councilmen
and
true
and
for
yourself
that
sedan
of
my
niece
it
a
good
car
last
model
but
only
run
about
four
thousand
miles
and
in
tiptop
condition
it
always
had
the
best
of
care
and
i
imagine
it
will
please
immensely
and
grant
you
surcease
from
sorrow
of
course
i
will
not
give
it
to
you
i
sell
it
to
you
five
hundred
down
upon
the
signing
of
the
agreement
and
in
lieu
of
the
cash
i
will
take
over
that
jitney
poundstone
finds
so
distasteful
then
i
will
employ
your
son
henry
as
the
attorney
for
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
and
give
him
a
retainer
of
hundred
dollars
for
one
year
i
will
leave
it
to
you
to
get
this
hundred
dollars
from
henry
and
pay
my
niece
cash
for
the
car
does
that
strike
you
as
a
perfectly
safe
and
sane
proposition
had
a
vista
of
paradise
opened
up
before
poundstone
he
could
not
have
been
more
thrilled
he
had
been
absolutely
honest
in
his
plea
to
poundstone
that
he
could
not
afford
a
sedan
much
as
he
longed
to
oblige
her
and
gain
a
greatly
to
be
desired
peace
and
now
the
price
was
dangling
before
his
eyes
so
to
speak
at
any
rate
it
was
parked
in
the
not
fifty
feet
distant
for
the
space
of
a
minute
the
mayor
weighed
his
son
future
as
a
corporation
attorney
against
his
own
future
as
mayor
of
sequoia
and
henry
lost
it
might
be
arranged
colonel
he
murmured
in
a
low
voice
the
voice
of
shame
it
is
already
arranged
the
colonel
replied
cheerfully
leave
your
jit
at
the
front
gate
and
drive
home
in
shirley
car
i
arrange
matters
with
he
laughed
shortly
it
means
of
course
that
have
to
telegraph
to
san
francisco
and
buy
her
a
later
model
thank
goodness
she
has
a
birthday
have
a
fresh
cigar
riding
home
that
night
in
shirley
sumner
car
poundstone
leaned
suddenly
toward
her
husband
threw
a
fat
arm
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
oh
henry
you
darling
she
purred
what
did
i
tell
you
if
a
person
only
wishes
hard
enough
oh
go
to
the
devil
he
roared
angrily
you
nagged
me
into
it
shut
up
and
take
your
arm
away
do
you
want
me
to
wreck
the
car
before
we
had
it
an
hour
as
for
colonel
pennington
he
had
little
difficulty
in
explaining
the
deal
to
shirley
who
was
sleepy
and
not
at
all
interested
the
poundstones
had
bored
her
to
extinction
and
upon
her
uncle
assurance
that
she
would
have
a
new
car
within
a
week
she
thanked
him
and
for
the
first
time
retired
without
offering
her
cheek
for
his
kiss
shortly
thereafter
the
colonel
sought
his
own
virtuous
couch
and
prepared
to
surrender
himself
to
the
first
good
sleep
in
three
weeks
he
laid
the
flattering
unction
to
his
soul
that
bryce
cardigan
had
dealt
him
a
poor
hand
from
a
marked
deck
and
he
had
played
it
exceedingly
well
lucky
i
blocked
the
young
beggar
from
getting
those
rails
out
of
the
laurel
creek
spur
he
mused
or
he
have
had
his
in
overnight
and
then
where
the
devil
would
i
have
been
up
salt
creek
without
a
paddle
and
all
the
courts
in
christendom
would
avail
me
he
was
dozing
off
when
a
sound
smote
upon
his
ears
instantly
he
was
wide
awake
listening
intently
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
the
sound
grew
louder
evidently
it
was
approaching
sequoia
and
with
a
bound
the
colonel
sat
up
in
bed
trembling
in
every
limb
suddenly
out
of
the
deep
rumbling
diapason
he
heard
a
sharp
click
then
another
and
another
he
counted
them
six
in
all
a
locomotive
and
two
he
murmured
and
they
just
passed
over
the
switch
leading
from
the
tracks
out
to
my
that
means
the
train
is
going
down
water
street
to
the
switch
into
cardigan
yard
by
george
they
outwitted
me
with
the
agility
of
a
boy
he
sprang
into
his
clothes
raced
downstairs
and
leaped
into
mayor
poundstone
jitney
standing
in
the
darkness
at
the
front
gate

plan
for
getting
ms
rails
down
from
laurel
creek
depended
entirely
upon
the
whimsy
which
might
seize
the
crew
of
the
big
mogul
that
hauled
the
last
load
of
logs
out
of
cardigan
redwoods
on
thursday
afternoon
should
the
engineer
and
fireman
decide
to
leave
the
locomotive
at
the
for
the
night
bryce
task
would
be
as
simple
as
turning
a
hose
down
a
on
the
other
hand
should
they
run
back
to
sequoia
with
the
engine
he
and
ogilvy
faced
the
alternative
of
borrowing
it
from
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
roundhouse
and
that
operation
in
view
of
the
fact
that
pennington
night
watchman
would
be
certain
to
hear
the
engine
leaving
offered
difficulties
throughout
the
afternoon
after
having
sent
his
orders
in
writing
to
the
via
george
sea
otter
for
he
dared
not
trust
to
the
telephone
be
waited
in
his
office
for
a
from
the
as
to
what
action
the
had
taken
he
could
not
work
he
could
not
think
he
only
knew
that
all
depended
upon
the
success
of
his
coup
finally
at
a
quarter
of
six
curtis
his
rang
in
they
staying
here
all
night
sir
he
reported
house
them
as
far
from
the
as
possible
and
organize
a
to
keep
them
busy
in
case
they
do
go
to
bed
before
eight
bryce
ordered
in
the
meantime
send
a
man
you
can
trust
jim
harding
who
runs
the
big
will
do
down
to
the
locomotive
to
keep
steam
up
until
i
he
had
scarcely
hung
up
when
buck
ogilvy
came
into
the
office
well
he
queried
casually
buck
replied
bryce
how
about
your
end
of
the
contract
crowbars
picks
shovels
to
cut
the
rails
lanterns
to
work
by
and
men
to
do
the
work
will
be
cached
in
your
by
nine
waiting
for
the
rails
to
bryce
nodded
his
approval
then
i
suppose
there
nothing
to
do
but
get
a
bite
of
dinner
and
proceed
to
buck
insisted
on
keeping
an
engagement
to
dine
with
moira
and
bryce
agreed
to
call
for
him
at
the
bon
gusto
restaurant
then
bryce
went
home
to
dine
with
his
father
old
cardigan
was
happier
than
his
son
had
seen
him
since
the
return
of
the
latter
to
sequoia
well
sonny
i
had
a
mighty
pleasant
afternoon
he
declared
as
bryce
led
him
to
the
i
been
up
to
the
valley
of
the
bryce
was
amazed
why
how
could
you
he
demanded
the
old
is
impassable
and
after
you
leave
the
end
of
the
the
trail
in
to
mother
grave
is
so
overgrown
with
buckthorn
and
wild
lilac
i
doubt
if
a
rabbit
could
get
through
it
not
a
bit
of
it
the
old
man
replied
somebody
has
gone
to
work
and
planked
that
old
and
put
up
a
on
each
side
while
the
trail
through
the
giants
has
been
grubbed
out
and
smoothed
over
all
that
old
i
abandoned
in
those
choppings
has
been
strung
from
tree
to
tree
alongside
the
path
on
both
sides
i
can
go
up
there
alone
now
once
george
sets
me
on
the
old
i
ca
get
how
did
you
discover
this
bryce
demanded
judge
moore
representing
the
new
owner
called
round
this
morning
and
took
me
in
tow
he
said
his
client
knew
the
property
held
for
me
a
certain
sentimental
value
which
was
transferred
in
the
deed
and
so
the
judge
had
been
instructed
to
have
the
planked
and
the
forest
trail
grubbed
out
for
me
it
appears
that
the
valley
is
going
to
be
a
public
park
after
all
but
for
the
present
and
while
i
live
it
is
my
private
this
is
perfectly
amazing
it
mighty
comforting
his
father
admitted
guess
the
new
owner
must
be
one
of
my
old
friends
perhaps
somebody
i
did
a
favour
for
once
and
this
is
his
way
of
repaying
remember
the
old
windfall
we
used
to
sit
on
well
it
rotted
through
and
bears
have
clawed
it
into
chips
in
their
search
for
grubs
but
the
new
owner
had
a
seat
put
in
there
for
me
just
the
kind
of
seat
i
like
a
lumberjack
made
from
an
old
i
sat
in
it
and
the
judge
left
me
and
i
did
a
right
smart
lot
o
thinking
and
while
it
did
lead
me
anywhere
still
i
er
you
felt
better
did
you
his
son
suggested
john
cardigan
nodded
i
like
to
know
the
name
of
the
owner
he
said
presently
i
like
mighty
well
to
say
thank
you
to
him
it
is
usual
for
people
nowadays
to
have
as
much
respect
for
sentiment
in
an
old
duffer
like
me
as
the
fellow
has
he
sort
of
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
had
sold
at
buck
ogilvy
came
out
of
the
bon
gusto
restaurant
with
moira
just
as
bryce
with
george
sea
otter
at
the
wheel
of
the
napier
drove
up
to
the
curb
they
left
moira
at
her
and
rolled
noiselessly
away
at
nine
they
arrived
at
cardigan
and
found
jim
harding
the
engineer
placidly
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
cab
bryce
hailed
him
that
you
jim
you
run
up
to
jabe
curtis
shanty
and
tell
him
we
here
have
him
gather
his
gang
and
bring
two
pairs
of
overalls
and
two
jumpers
large
size
with
him
when
he
harding
vanished
into
the
darkness
and
buck
ogilvy
climbed
up
into
the
cab
and
glanced
at
the
a
hundred
and
forty
he
announced
good
enough
presently
the
accompanied
by
thirty
of
his
best
men
came
down
to
the
at
bryce
order
they
clambered
aboard
the
engine
and
tender
hanging
on
the
steps
on
the
roof
of
the
cab
on
the
cowcatcher
anywhere
they
could
find
a
harding
cast
aside
the
two
old
ties
which
the
careful
had
placed
across
the
tracks
in
front
of
the
drivers
as
additional
precaution
buck
ogilvy
cut
off
the
air
and
the
locomotive
and
tender
began
to
glide
slowly
down
the
almost
imperceptible
grade
with
a
slight
click
it
cleared
the
switch
and
slid
out
onto
the
cardigan
lateral
swiftly
gathering
speed
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
line
buck
ogilvy
applied
the
brakes
and
eased
her
down
to
twenty
miles
per
hour
at
the
junction
with
the
main
line
buck
backed
briskly
up
into
the
laguna
grande
woods
and
coupled
to
the
two
loaded
the
scrambled
aboard
the
flats
and
the
train
pulled
out
for
sequoia
forty
minutes
later
they
rumbled
down
water
street
and
slid
to
a
grinding
halt
at
the
intersection
of
b
street
from
the
darkness
of
cardigan
where
they
had
been
waiting
twenty
picked
men
of
the
now
emerged
bearing
lanterns
and
tools
under
buck
ogilvy
direction
the
dirt
promptly
began
to
fly
while
the
unloaded
the
rails
and
piled
them
close
to
the
sidewalk
suddenly
a
voice
harsh
and
strident
with
passion
rose
above
the
thud
of
the
picks
and
the
clang
of
metal
who
in
charge
here
and
what
in
blazes
do
you
mean
by
cutting
my
tracks
bryce
turned
in
time
to
behold
colonel
seth
pennington
leap
from
an
automobile
and
advance
upon
buck
ogilvy
ogilvy
held
a
lantern
up
to
the
colonel
face
and
surveyed
pennington
calmly
colonel
he
began
with
exasperating
politeness
i
presume
you
are
colonel
pennington
my
name
is
buchanan
ogilvy
and
i
am
in
charge
of
these
operations
i
am
the
and
general
manager
of
the
and
i
am
engaged
in
the
blithe
task
of
making
a
of
your
rails
i
had
hoped
to
accomplish
this
without
your
knowledge
or
consent
but
now
that
you
are
here
that
hope
of
course
has
died
have
a
and
he
thrust
a
perfecco
under
the
nose
pennington
struck
it
to
the
ground
and
on
the
instant
half
a
dozen
rough
rascals
emptied
their
shovels
over
him
he
was
deluged
with
dirt
stand
back
colonel
stand
back
if
you
please
you
in
the
way
of
the
shovellers
buck
ogilvy
warned
him
soothingly
bryce
cardigan
came
over
and
at
sight
of
him
pennington
choked
with
fury
you
you
he
sputtered
unable
to
say
more
i
the
bryce
replied
nice
little
fiction
that
of
yours
about
the
being
laid
up
in
the
shops
and
the
laurel
creek
bridge
being
unsafe
for
this
big
he
looked
pennington
over
with
frank
admiration
you
certainly
on
the
job
colonel
i
say
that
much
for
you
the
man
who
plans
to
defeat
you
must
jump
far
and
fast
or
his
tail
will
be
trod
you
stolen
my
engine
pennington
almost
screamed
i
have
the
law
on
you
for
grand
you
do
know
who
stole
your
engine
for
all
you
know
your
own
may
have
run
it
down
i
attend
to
you
sir
pennington
replied
and
he
turned
to
enter
mayor
poundstone
little
flivver
not
at
least
bryce
retorted
gently
having
gone
this
far
i
would
be
a
poor
general
to
permit
you
to
escape
now
with
the
news
of
your
discovery
you
be
down
here
in
an
hour
with
a
couple
of
hundred
members
of
your
and
give
us
the
rush
you
will
oblige
me
colonel
pennington
by
remaining
exactly
where
you
are
until
i
give
you
permission
to
and
if
i
refuse
then
i
shall
manhandle
you
truss
you
up
like
a
fowl
in
the
tonneau
of
your
car
and
gag
to
bryce
infinite
surprise
the
colonel
smiled
oh
very
well
he
replied
i
guess
you
got
the
bulge
on
me
young
man
do
you
mind
if
i
sit
in
the
warm
cab
of
my
own
engine
i
came
away
in
such
a
hurry
i
quite
forgot
my
not
at
all
i
sit
up
there
and
keep
you
half
an
hour
passed
an
automobile
came
slowly
up
water
street
and
paused
half
a
block
away
evidently
reconnoitering
the
situation
instantly
the
colonel
thrust
his
head
out
the
cab
window
sexton
he
shouted
cardigan
cutting
in
a
crossing
he
holding
me
here
against
my
will
get
the
together
and
phone
for
rondeau
and
his
send
the
and
a
couple
of
flats
up
for
them
phone
poundstone
tell
him
to
have
the
chief
of
police
bryce
cardigan
great
hand
closed
over
the
colonel
neck
while
down
water
street
a
dark
streak
that
was
buck
ogilvy
sped
toward
the
automobile
intending
to
climb
in
and
make
pennington
manager
a
prisoner
also
he
was
too
late
however
sexton
swung
his
car
and
departed
at
full
speed
down
water
street
leaving
the
disappointed
buck
to
return
panting
to
the
scene
of
operations
bryce
cardigan
released
his
hold
on
pennington
neck
you
win
colonel
he
announced
no
good
can
come
of
holding
you
here
any
longer
into
your
car
and
on
your
thank
you
young
man
the
colonel
answered
and
there
was
a
metallic
ring
in
his
voice
he
looked
at
his
watch
in
the
glare
of
a
torch
plenty
of
time
he
murmured
curfew
shall
not
ring
quite
deliberately
he
climbed
into
the
mayor
late
source
of
woe
and
breezed
away
colonel
pennington
did
not
at
once
return
to
his
home
however
instead
he
drove
up
to
the
business
centre
of
the
town
the
streets
were
deserted
but
one
saloon
the
sawdust
pile
was
still
open
pennington
strode
through
the
bar
and
into
the
back
room
where
a
number
of
were
in
progress
for
a
moment
he
stood
his
cold
ophidian
glance
circling
the
room
until
it
came
to
rest
on
no
less
a
personage
than
the
black
minorca
an
individual
with
whom
the
reader
has
already
had
some
slight
acquaintance
it
will
be
recalled
that
the
black
minorca
led
the
futile
rush
against
bryce
cardigan
that
day
in
pennington
woods
the
colonel
approached
the
table
where
the
black
minorca
sat
thumbing
the
edges
of
his
cards
and
touched
the
cholo
on
the
shoulder
the
black
minorca
turned
and
pennington
nodded
to
him
to
follow
whereupon
the
latter
cashed
in
his
chips
and
joined
his
employer
on
the
sidewalk
here
a
whispered
conversation
ensued
and
at
its
conclusion
the
black
minorca
nodded
vigorously
sure
he
assured
the
colonel
i
fix
good
and
together
pennington
and
the
black
minorca
entered
the
automobile
and
proceeded
swiftly
to
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
from
a
locker
the
colonel
produced
a
repeating
rifle
and
three
boxes
of
cartridges
which
he
handed
to
the
cholo
who
departed
without
further
ado
into
the
night
twenty
minutes
later
from
the
top
of
a
in
bryce
cardigan
saw
the
flash
of
a
rifle
and
felt
a
sudden
sting
on
his
left
forearm
he
leaped
around
in
front
of
the
cowcatcher
to
gain
the
shelter
of
the
engine
and
another
bullet
struck
at
his
feet
and
ricocheted
off
into
the
night
it
was
followed
by
a
fusillade
the
bullets
kicking
up
the
freshly
disturbed
earth
among
the
workers
and
sending
them
scurrying
to
various
points
of
safety
in
an
instant
the
crossing
was
deserted
and
work
had
been
stopped
while
from
the
top
of
the
adjacent
the
black
minorca
poured
a
stream
of
lead
and
filthy
invective
at
every
point
which
he
suspected
of
harbouring
a
cardigan
follower
i
do
think
he
hurt
anybody
buck
ogilvy
whispered
as
he
crouched
with
bryce
beside
the
engine
but
that
due
to
his
marksmanship
rather
than
his
he
tried
hard
enough
to
plug
me
bryce
declared
and
showed
the
hole
through
his
sleeve
they
call
him
the
black
minorca
and
he
a
mongrel
greaser
who
kill
his
own
mother
for
a
i
like
to
plug
him
buck
murmured
regretfully
what
would
be
the
use
this
will
be
his
last
night
in
humboldt
county
a
rifle
shot
rang
out
from
the
side
of
b
street
from
the
across
the
street
bryce
and
ogilvy
heard
a
suppressed
grunt
of
pain
and
a
crash
as
of
a
breaking
board
instantly
out
of
the
shadows
george
sea
otter
came
padding
on
velvet
feet
rifle
in
hand
and
then
bryce
understood
all
right
boss
said
george
simply
as
he
joined
bryce
and
ogilvy
under
the
lee
of
the
locomotive
now
we
get
busy
men
ogilvy
called
back
to
the
and
while
bryce
followed
by
the
careless
george
sea
otter
went
into
the
to
succour
the
enemy
ogilvy
set
an
example
to
the
men
by
stepping
into
the
open
and
starting
briskly
to
work
with
a
shovel
at
the
bottom
of
the
pile
of
lumber
the
black
minorca
was
discovered
with
a
severe
in
his
right
hip
also
he
was
suffering
from
numerous
bruises
and
contusions
george
sea
otter
possessed
himself
of
the
fallen
cholo
rifle
while
bryce
picked
the
wretch
up
and
carried
him
to
his
automobile
take
the
swine
over
to
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
hospital
and
tell
them
to
patch
him
up
he
ordered
george
sea
otter
i
keep
both
rifles
and
the
ammunition
here
for
jules
rondeau
and
his
they
probably
be
dropping
in
on
us
about
two
if
i
know
anything
about
colonel
pennington
way
of
doing
chapter
xxxi
having
dispatched
the
black
minorca
to
hold
up
the
work
until
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
colonel
pennington
fairly
burned
the
streets
en
route
to
his
home
he
realized
that
there
would
be
no
more
sleep
for
him
that
night
and
he
was
desirous
of
getting
into
a
heavy
ulster
before
venturing
forth
again
into
the
night
air
the
violent
slam
with
which
he
closed
the
front
door
after
him
brought
shirley
in
and
slippers
to
the
staircase
uncle
seth
she
called
here
he
replied
from
the
hall
below
what
the
matter

the
devil
to
pay
he
answered
that
fellow
cardigan
is
back
of
the
after
all
and
he
and
ogilvy
have
a
gang
of
fifty
men
down
at
the
intersection
of
water
and
b
streets
cutting
in
a
of

he
dashed
into
the
living
room
and
she
heard
him
calling
frantically
into
the
telephone
at
last
she
murmured
and
crept
down
the
stairs
pausing
behind
the
heavy
portieres
at
the
entrance
to
the
living
room
that
you
poundstone
she
heard
him
saying
rapidly
into
the

he
stood
at
the
telephone
the
receiver
still
held
to
his
ear
and
his
right
forefinger
holding
down
the
hook
while
the
line
cleared
when
he
spoke
again
shirley
knew
he

got
a
response
immediately
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour

me
if

shirley
was
standing
in
the
doorway
as
he
faced
about
from
the
telephone
uncle
seth
she
said
quietly

any
honourable
method
of
defeating
bryce
cardigan
but
call
off
the
black
minorca

hold
you
personally
responsible
for

he
soothed
her
do

i

but
its

shooting
just
to

minorca

black
minorca

kill
him
go
instantly
and
stop

he
said
rather
humbly
and
sprang
down
the
front
steps
into
the
waiting
car
i
play
the
game
fairly
shirley
never
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
watched
the
red
like
a
malevolent
eye
disappear
down
the
street
and
presently
as
she
stood
there
down
the
boulevard
a
huge
gray
car
came
slipping
noiselessly
so
noiselessly
in
fact
that
shirley
recognized
it
by
that
very
quality
of
silence
it
was
bryce
cardigan
napier
george
she
called
come
the
car
slid
over
to
the
gate
and
stopped
at
the
sight
of
the
slim
white
figure
running
down
the
garden
walk
is
cardigan
hurt
she
demanded
in
an
agony
of
suspense
george
sea
otter
grunted
contemptuously
nobody

the
black
minorca
i
am
taking
him
to
your
company
hospital
miss
he
tried
to
shoot
my
boss
so
i
shoot

through
the
leg
now
my
boss

to
the
laguna
grande
hospital
george

i
would

the
bay

hysterically
on
your
way
back
from
the
hospital
stop
and
pick
me
up
george
she
ordered
this
senseless
feud

gone
far
enough
i
must
stop
it
at
he
touched
his
broad
hat
and
she
returned
to
the
house
to
dress
meanwhile
colonel
pennington
had
reached
the
crossing
once
more
simultaneously
with
the
arrival
of
sam
perkins
the
chief
of
police
accompanied
by
two
automobiles
crammed
with
patrolmen
perkins
strutted
up
to
bryce
cardigan
and
buck
ogilvy
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
row
cardigan
he
demanded
something
has
slipped
sam
bryce
retorted
pleasantly
you
been
calling
me
bryce
for
the
past
twenty
years
and
now
you
mistering
me
the
meaning
of
this
row
you
ask
bryce
continued
well
i
engaged
in
making
a
of
colonel
pennington
tracks
under
a
temporary
franchise
granted
me
by
the
city
of
sequoia
here
the
and
he
thrust
the
document
under
the
police
chief
nose
this
is
the
first
i
heard
about
any
franchise
sam
perkins
replied
suspiciously
seems
to
me
you
been
mighty
secret
about
this
job
how
do
i
know
this
ai
a
forgery
call
up
the
mayor
and
ask
him
bryce
suggested
i
do
that
quoth
perkins
ponderously
and
in
the
meantime
do
do
any
more
digging
or
he
hurried
away
to
his
automobile
leaving
a
lieutenant
in
charge
of
the
squad
also
in
the
meantime
young
man
colonel
pennington
announced
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
take
possession
of
my
locomotive
and
i
observe
you
have
finished
unloading
those
help
yourself
colonel
bryce
replied
with
an
assumption
of
heartiness
he
was
far
from
feeling
thank
you
so
much
with
the
greatest
good
nature
in
life
pennington
climbed
into
the
cab
reached
for
the
and
rang
the
bell
vigorously
then
he
permitted
himself
a
triumphant
toot
of
the
whistle
after
which
he
threw
off
the
air
and
gently
opened
the
throttle
he
was
not
a
but
he
had
ridden
in
the
cab
of
his
own
locomotive
and
felt
quite
confident
of
his
ability
in
a
pinch
with
a
creak
and
a
bump
the
train
started
and
the
colonel
ran
it
slowly
up
until
the
locomotive
stood
on
the
tracks
exactly
where
buck
ogilvy
had
been
cutting
in
his
crossing
whereupon
the
colonel
locked
the
brakes
opened
his
exhaust
and
blew
the
boiler
down
and
when
the
last
ounce
of
steam
had
escaped
he
descended
and
smilingly
accosted
bryce
cardigan
that
engine
being
my
property
he
announced
i
take
the
short
end
of
any
bet
you
care
to
make
young
man
that
it
will
sit
on
those
tracks
until
your
temporary
franchise
expires
i
give
a
good
deal
to
see
anybody
not
in
my
employ
attempt
to
get
up
steam
in
that
boiler
until
i
give
the
word
cut
in
your
now
if
you
can
you
whelp
and
be
damned
to
you
i
got
you
blocked
i
rather
imagine
this
nice
gentleman
has
it
on
us
old
dear
chirped
buck
ogilvy
plaintively
well
we
did
our
damndest
which
angels
ca
do
no
more
let
us
gather
up
our
tools
and
go
home
my
son
for
something
tells
me
that
if
i
hang
around
here
i
bust
one
of
two
things
this
sleek
scoundrel
gray
head
or
one
of
my
bellicose
veins
hello
whom
have
we
here
bryce
turned
and
found
himself
facing
shirley
sumner
her
tender
lip
was
quivering
and
the
tears
shone
in
her
eyes
like
stars
he
stared
at
her
in
silence
my
friend
she
murmured
tremulously
did
i
tell
you
i
would
not
permit
you
to
build
the
he
bowed
his
head
in
rage
and
shame
at
his
defeat
buck
ogilvy
took
him
by
the
arm
midnight
holy
hour
he
quoted
silence
now
is
brooding
like
a
gentle
spirit
a
still
and
pulseless
world
bryce
old
chap
this
is
one
of
those
occasions
where
silence
is
golden
speak
not
i
do
it
for
you
miss
sumner
he
continued
bowing
graciously
and
colonel
pennington
favouring
that
triumphant
rascal
with
an
equally
gracious
bow
we
leave
you
in
possession
of
the
field
temporarily
however
if
anybody
should
drive
up
in
a
hack
and
lean
out
and
ask
you
just
tell
him
buck
ogilvy
has
another
trump
tucked
away
in
his
bryce
turned
to
go
but
with
a
sudden
impulse
shirley
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
his
left
arm
bryce
she
murmured
he
lifted
her
hand
gently
from
his
forearm
led
her
to
the
front
of
the
locomotive
and
held
her
hand
up
to
the
headlight
her
fingers
were
crimson
with
blood
your
uncle
killer
did
that
shirley
he
said
ironically
it
only
a
slight
but
that
is
no
fault
of
your
allies
and
he
left
her
standing
pale
of
face
and
trembling
in
the
white
glare
of
the
headlight
chapter
xxxii
shirley
made
no
effort
to
detain
bryce
cardigan
as
he
walked
to
his
car
and
climbed
into
it
ogilvy
remained
merely
long
enough
to
give
orders
to
the
foreman
to
gather
up
the
tools
store
them
in
the
of
cardigan
mill
and
dismiss
his
gang
then
he
too
entered
the
automobile
and
at
a
word
from
bryce
the
car
slid
noiselessly
away
into
the
darkness
the
crew
departed
a
few
minutes
later
and
when
shirley
found
herself
alone
with
her
uncle
the
tumult
in
her
heart
gave
way
to
the
tears
she
could
no
longer
repress
pennington
stood
by
watching
her
curiously
coldly
presently
shirley
mastered
her
emotion
and
glanced
toward
him
well
my
dear
he
queried
nervously
i
i
think
i
had
better
go
home
she
said
without
spirit
i
think
so
too
he
answered
get
into
the
mayor
flivver
my
dear
and
i
drive
you
and
perhaps
the
least
said
about
this
affair
the
better
shirley
there
are
many
things
that
you
do
not
understand
and
which
can
not
be
elucidated
by
i
can
understand
an
attempt
at
assassination
uncle
that
blackguard
minorca
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
put
him
on
such
a
job
i
told
him
to
bluff
and
threaten
cardigan
i
knew
would
realize
the
grudge
the
black
minorca
has
against
him
and
for
that
reason
i
figured
the
greaser
was
the
only
man
who
could
bluff
him
while
i
gave
him
orders
to
shoot
i
told
him
distinctly
not
to
hit
anybody
good
lord
shirley
surely
you
do
not
think
i
would
wink
at
a
murder
i
do
she
answered
passionately
with
bryce
cardigan
out
of
the
way
you
would
have
a
clear
field
before
you
oh
my
dear
my
dear
surely
you
do
not
realize
what
you
are
saying
you
are
beside
yourself
shirley
please
please
do
not
wound
me
so
so
horribly
you
do
not
you
can
not
realize
what
a
desperate
fight
i
have
been
putting
up
for
both
our
sakes
i
am
surrounded
by
enemies
the
most
implacable
enemies
they
force
me
to
fight
the
devil
with
fire
and
here
you
are
giving
them
aid
and
i
want
you
to
defeat
bryce
cardigan
if
you
can
do
it
at
another
time
and
in
a
calmer
mood
we
will
discuss
that
villain
he
said
authoritatively
if
we
argue
the
matter
now
we
are
liable
to
misunderstandings
we
may
quarrel
and
that
is
something
neither
of
us
can
afford
get
into
the
car
and
we
will
go
home
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
your
sophistry
does
not
alter
my
opinion
she
replied
firmly
however
as
you
say
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
to
discuss
they
drove
home
in
silence
shirley
went
at
once
to
her
room
for
the
colonel
however
the
night
work
had
scarcely
begun
the
instant
he
heard
the
door
to
his
niece
room
shut
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
laguna
grande
roundhouse
sexton
his
manager
answered
have
you
sent
the
to
the
woods
for
rondeau
and
his
men
just
good
now
then
sexton
listen
to
me
as
you
know
this
raid
of
cardigan
has
developed
so
suddenly
i
am
more
or
less
taken
by
surprise
and
have
had
no
time
to
prepare
the
kind
of
that
will
be
most
effective
however
with
the
crossing
blocked
i
gain
time
in
which
to
organize
only
there
must
be
no
weak
point
in
my
organization
in
order
to
insure
that
i
am
proceeding
to
san
francisco
by
motor
via
the
coast
road
i
will
arrive
late
night
and
early
saturday
morning
i
will
appear
in
the
united
states
district
court
with
our
attorneys
and
file
a
complaint
and
petition
for
an
order
temporarily
restraining
the
from
cutting
our
tracks
i
will
have
to
make
an
affidavit
to
support
the
complaint
so
i
had
better
be
to
do
it
rather
than
risk
the
delay
of
making
the
affidavit
tomorrow
morning
here
and
forwarding
it
by
mail
to
our
attorneys
the
judge
will
sign
a
restraining
order
returnable
in
from
ten
to
thirty
days
i
try
for
thirty
because
that
will
knock
out
the
temporary
franchise
and
after
i
have
obtained
the
restraining
order
i
will
have
the
united
states
marshal
telegraph
it
to
ogilvy
and
cardigan
bully
cried
sexton
heartily
that
will
fix
their
in
the
meantime
pennington
continued
logs
will
be
glutting
our
landings
we
need
that
locomotive
for
its
legitimate
purposes
take
all
that
discarded
machinery
and
the
old
boiler
we
removed
from
the
mill
last
fall
dump
it
on
the
tracks
at
the
crossing
and
get
the
locomotive
back
on
its
run
understand
the
other
side
having
no
means
of
removing
these
heavy
obstructions
will
be
blocked
until
i
return
by
that
time
the
matter
will
be
in
the
district
court
cardigan
will
be
hung
up
until
his
temporary
franchise
expires
and
the
city
council
will
not
renew
it
get
me
yes
i
be
back
sunday
forenoon
he
hung
up
went
to
his
chauffeur
quarters
over
the
garage
and
routed
the
man
out
of
bed
then
he
returned
quietly
to
his
room
dressed
and
packed
a
bag
for
his
journey
left
a
brief
note
for
shirley
notifying
her
of
his
departure
and
started
on
his
mile
trip
over
the
mountains
to
the
south
as
his
car
sped
through
sleeping
sequoia
and
gained
the
open
country
the
colonel
heart
thrilled
pleasurably
he
held
cards
and
spades
big
and
little
casino
four
aces
and
the
joker
therefore
he
knew
he
could
sweep
the
board
at
his
pleasure
and
during
his
absence
shirley
would
have
opportunity
to
cool
off
while
he
would
find
time
to
formulate
an
argument
to
lull
her
suspicions
upon
his
return
chapter
xxxiii
quite
oblivious
of
her
uncle
departure
for
san
francisco
shirley
lay
awake
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
night
turning
over
and
over
in
her
mind
the
various
aspects
of
the
imbroglio
of
one
thing
she
was
quite
certain
peace
must
be
declared
at
all
hazards
she
had
been
obsessed
of
a
desire
rather
unusual
in
her
sex
to
see
a
fight
worth
while
she
had
planned
to
permit
it
to
go
to
a
knockout
to
use
bryce
cardigan
language
because
she
believed
bryce
cardigan
would
be
vanquished
and
she
had
desired
to
see
him
smashed
but
not
beyond
repair
for
her
joy
in
the
conflict
was
to
lie
in
the
task
of
putting
the
pieces
together
afterward
she
realized
now
however
that
she
had
permitted
matters
to
go
too
far
a
revulsion
of
feeling
toward
her
uncle
induced
by
the
memory
of
bryce
cardigan
blood
on
her
white
convinced
the
girl
that
at
all
hazards
to
her
financial
future
henceforth
she
and
her
uncle
must
tread
separate
paths
she
had
found
him
out
at
last
and
because
in
her
nature
there
was
some
of
his
own
fixity
of
purpose
the
resolution
cost
her
no
particular
pang
it
was
rather
a
relief
therefore
when
the
imperturbable
james
handed
her
at
breakfast
the
following
note
shirley
dear
after
leaving
you
last
night
i
decided
that
in
your
present
frame
of
mind
my
absence
for
a
few
days
might
tend
to
a
calmer
and
clearer
perception
on
your
part
of
the
necessary
tactics
which
in
a
moment
of
desperation
i
saw
fit
with
regret
to
pursue
last
night
and
in
the
hope
that
you
will
have
attained
your
old
attitude
toward
me
before
my
return
i
am
leaving
in
the
motor
for
san
francisco
your
terrible
accusation
has
grieved
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
do
not
feel
equal
to
the
task
of
confronting
you
until
in
a
more
judicial
frame
of
mind
you
can
truly
absolve
me
of
the
charge
of
wishing
to
do
away
with
young
cardigan
your
affectionate
uncle
seth
shirley
lip
curled
with
a
rarer
keener
intuition
than
she
had
hitherto
manifested
she
sensed
the
hypocrisy
between
the
lines
she
was
not
deceived
he
has
gone
to
san
francisco
for
more
ammunition
she
soliloquized
very
well
while
you
away
i
shall
manufacture
a
few
bombs
after
breakfast
she
left
the
house
and
walked
to
the
intersection
of
b
with
water
street
jules
rondeau
and
his
crew
of
lumberjacks
were
there
and
with
two
policemen
guarded
the
crossing
rondeau
glanced
at
shirley
surprised
then
lifted
his
hat
shirley
looked
from
the
woods
bully
to
the
locomotive
and
back
to
rondeau
rondeau
she
said

cardigan

a
bad
man
to
fight

him

going
to
do
it

he
nodded
by
whose
orders
mr
sexton
he
tell
me
to
do
well
rondeau
some
day
i
be
boss
of
laguna
grande
and

she
replied
and
passed
on
down
b
street
to
the
office
of
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
moira
mctavish
looked
up
as
she
entered
where
is
he
dear
shirley
asked
i
must
see
in
that
office
miss
shirley
moira
replied
and
pointed
to
the
door
shirley
stepped
to
the
door
knocked
and
then
entered
bryce
cardigan
seated
at
his
desk
looked
up
as
she
came
in
his
left
arm
was
in
a
sling
and
he
looked
harassed
and
dejected
do
get
up
bryce
she
said
as
he
attempted
to
rise
i
know
quite
exhausted
you
look
she
sat
down
i
so
sorry
she
said
softly
his
dull
glance
brightened
it
does
amount
to
that
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
it
throbs
a
little
and
it
stiff
and
sore
so
i
carry
it
in
the
sling
that
helps
a
little
what
did
you
want
to
see
me
about
i
wanted
to
tell
you
said
shirley
that
that
last
night
affair
was
not
of
my
he
smiled
compassionately
i
i
could
bear
to
have
you
think
i
break
my
word
and
tell
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
had
dealt
me
a
hand
from
the
bottom
of
the
deck
shirley
please
do
worry
about
it
your
uncle
has
had
two
private
detectives
watching
ogilvy
and
oh
she
breathed
much
relieved
a
ghost
of
the
old
bantering
smile
lighted
her
winsome
features
well
then
she
challenged
i
suppose
you
do
hate
on
the
contrary
i
love
you
he
answered
however
since
you
must
have
known
this
for
some
time
past
i
suppose
it
is
superfluous
to
mention
it
moreover
i
have
the
right
she
had
cast
her
eyes
down
modestly
she
raised
them
now
and
looked
at
him
searchingly
i
suppose
you
acknowledge
yourself
whipped
at
last
bryce
she
ventured
would
it
please
you
to
have
me
surrender
he
was
very
serious
indeed
it
would
why
because
i
tired
of
fighting
i
want
peace
i
i
afraid
to
let
this
matter
go
any
further
i
truly
i
think
i
want
peace
too
he
answered
wearily
i
be
glad
to
quit
with
honour
and
i
do
it
too
if
you
can
induce
your
uncle
to
give
me
the
kind
of
logging
contract
i
want
with
his
i
could
do
that
bryce
he
has
you
whipped
and
he
is
not
merciful
to
the
fallen
you
have
to
surrender
again
she
laid
her
little
hand
timidly
on
his
wounded
forearm
please
give
up
bryce
for
my
sake
if
you
persist
somebody
will
get
i
suppose
i
have
to
he
murmured
sadly
i
dare
say
right
though
one
should
never
admit
defeat
until
he
is
counted
out
i
suppose
he
continued
bitterly
your
uncle
is
in
high
feather
this
i
do
know
bryce
he
left
in
his
motor
for
san
francisco
about
one
this
for
an
instant
bryce
cardigan
stared
at
her
then
a
slow
mocking
little
smile
crept
around
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
lighted
with
mirth
glorious
news
my
dear
shirley
perfectly
glorious
so
the
old
fox
has
gone
to
san
francisco
eh
left
in
a
hurry
and
via
the
overland
route
could
wait
for
the
regular
eh
great
jumping
jehoshaphat
he
must
have
had
important
business
to
attend
and
bryce
commenced
to
chuckle
oh
the
poor
old
colonel
he
continued
presently
the
dear
old
pirate
what
a
horrible
right
swing
running
into
and
you
want
me
to
acknowledge
defeat
my
dear
girl
in
the
language
of
the
classic
there
is
nothing
doing
i
shall
put
in
my
crossing
sunday
morning
and
if
you
do
believe
it
drop
around
and
see
me
in
you
must
try
protested
shirley
rondeau
is
there
with
his
crew
and
he
has
orders
to
stop
you
besides
you
ca
expect
help
from
the
police
uncle
seth
has
made
a
deal
with
the
mayor
shirley
pleaded
frantically
that
for
the
police
and
that
venal
mayor
poundstone
bryce
retorted
with
another
snap
of
his
fingers
i
rid
the
city
of
them
at
the
fall
i
came
prepared
to
suggest
a
compromise
bryce
she
declared
but
he
interrupted
her
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
you
ca
effect
a
compromise
you
been
telling
me
i
shall
never
build
the
because
you
will
not
permit
me
to
you
powerless
i
tell
you
i
shall
build
you
sha
she
fired
back
at
him
and
a
spot
of
anger
glowed
in
each
cheek
you
the
most
stubborn
and
belligerent
man
i
have
ever
known
sometimes
i
almost
hate
come
around
at
ten
morning
and
watch
me
put
in
the
crossing
watch
me
give
rondeau
and
his
gang
the
he
reached
over
suddenly
lifted
her
hand
and
kissed
it
how
i
love
you
dear
little
antagonist
he
murmured
if
you
loved
me
you
would
oppose
me
she
protested
softly
i
tell
you
again
bryce
you
make
it
very
hard
for
me
to
be
friendly
with
i
do
want
to
be
friendly
with
you
you
driving
me
crazy
shirley
please
run
along
home
or
wherever
you
bound
i
tried
to
understand
your
peculiar
code
but
you
too
deep
for
me
so
let
me
go
my
way
to
the
devil
george
sea
otter
is
outside
asleep
in
the
tonneau
of
the
car
tell
him
to
drive
you
wherever
you
going
i
suppose
you
afoot
for
i
noticed
the
mayor
riding
to
his
office
in
your
sedan
this
she
tried
to
look
outraged
but
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
take
offense
at
his
bluntness
neither
did
she
resent
a
look
which
she
detected
in
his
eyes
even
though
it
told
her
he
was
laughing
at
her
oh
very
well
she
replied
with
what
dignity
she
could
muster
have
it
your
own
way
i
tried
to
warn
you
thank
you
for
your
offer
of
the
car
i
shall
be
glad
to
use
it
uncle
seth
sold
my
car
to
mayor
poundstone
last
night
admired
it
so
ah
then
it
was
that
rascally
poundstone
who
told
your
uncle
about
the
temporary
franchise
thus
arousing
his
suspicions
to
such
an
extent
that
when
he
heard
his
locomotive
rumbling
into
town
he
smelled
a
rat
and
hurried
down
to
the
crossing
possibly
the
poundstones
dined
at
our
house
last
pretty
hard
on
you
i
should
say
but
then
i
suppose
you
have
to
play
the
game
with
uncle
seth
well
good
morning
shirley
sorry
to
hurry
you
away
but
you
must
remember
we
on
a
strictly
business
basis
yet
and
you
must
waste
my
you
horrid
bryce
you
adorable
good
you
be
sorry
for
this
she
warned
him
good
she
passed
out
into
the
general
office
visited
with
moira
about
five
minutes
and
drove
away
in
the
napier
bryce
watched
her
through
the
window
she
knew
he
was
watching
her
but
nevertheless
she
could
not
forbear
turning
round
to
verify
her
suspicions
when
she
did
he
waved
his
sound
arm
at
her
and
she
flushed
with
vexation
god
bless
her
he
murmured
she
been
my
ally
all
along
and
i
never
suspected
it
i
wonder
what
her
game
can
he
sat
musing
for
a
long
time
yes
he
concluded
presently
old
poundstone
has
us
and
pennington
made
it
worth
his
while
and
the
colonel
sold
the
mayor
his
niece
automobile
worth
hundred
dollars
at
least
and
since
old
finances
will
not
permit
such
an
extravagance
i
wondering
how
pennington
expects
him
to
pay
for
it
i
smell
a
rat
as
big
as
a
kangaroo
in
this
case
two
and
two
do
make
four
they
make
six
guess
i
build
a
fire
under
old
he
took
down
the
and
called
up
the
mayor
bryce
cardigan
speaking
poundstone
he
greeted
the
chief
executive
of
sequoia
oh
hello
bryce
my
boy
poundstone
boomed
affably
how
tricks
i
hear
you
bought
that
sedan
from
colonel
pennington
niece
wish
i
known
it
was
for
sale
i
have
outbid
you
want
to
make
a
profit
on
your
bargain
no
not
this
morning
bryce
i
think
we
keep
it
has
been
wanting
a
closed
car
for
a
long
time
and
when
the
colonel
offered
me
this
one
at
a
bargain
i
snapped
it
up
could
afford
a
new
one
you
know
but
then
this
one
just
as
good
as
and
you
do
care
to
get
rid
of
it
at
a
profit
bryce
repeated
no
sirree
oh
you
mistaken
mayor
i
think
you
do
i
would
suggest
that
you
take
that
car
back
to
pennington
garage
and
leave
it
there
that
would
be
the
most
profitable
thing
you
could
wha
what
what
in
blue
blazes
are
you
driving
at
the
mayor
sputtered
i
would
care
to
discuss
it
over
the
telephone
i
take
it
however
that
a
hint
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
and
i
warn
you
mayor
that
if
you
keep
that
car
it
will
bring
you
bad
luck
is
friday
and
friday
is
an
unlucky
day
i
get
rid
of
that
sedan
before
noon
if
i
were
there
was
a
long
fateful
silence
then
in
a
singularly
small
quavering
voice
you
think
it
best
cardigan
i
do
return
it
to
no
redwood
boulevard
and
no
questions
will
be
asked
when
shirley
reached
home
at
noon
she
found
her
car
parked
in
front
of
the
porte
cochere
and
a
brief
note
left
with
the
butler
informed
her
that
after
thinking
the
matter
over
poundstone
had
decided
the
poundstone
family
could
not
afford
such
an
extravagance
and
accordingly
the
car
was
returned
with
many
thanks
for
the
opportunity
to
purchase
it
at
such
a
ridiculously
low
figure
shirley
smiled
and
put
the
car
up
in
the
garage
when
she
returned
to
the
house
her
maid
thelma
informed
her
that
bryce
cardigan
had
been
calling
her
on
the
telephone
so
she
called
bryce
up
at
once
has
poundstone
returned
your
car
he
queried
why
yes
what
makes
you
ask
oh
i
had
a
suspicion
he
might
you
see
i
called
him
up
and
suggested
it
somehow
his
honour
is
peculiarly
susceptible
to
suggestions
from
me
and
bryce
cardigan
she
declared
you
a
sly
rascal
that
what
you
are
i
sha
tell
you
another
i
hope
you
had
a
stenographer
at
the
dictograph
when
the
mayor
and
your
uncle
cooked
up
their
little
deal
he
continued
that
was
thoughtful
of
you
shirley
it
was
a
bully
club
to
have
up
your
sleeve
at
the
final
for
with
it
you
can
make
behave
himself
and
force
that
compromise
you
spoke
of
seriously
however
i
do
want
you
to
use
it
shirley
we
must
avoid
a
scandal
by
all
means
and
praise
be
i
do
need
your
club
to
beat
your
uncle
brains
out
i
taking
his
club
away
from
him
to
use
for
that
really
i
believe
you
happy
happy
i
should
tell
a
man
if
the
streets
of
sequoia
were
paved
with
eggs
i
could
walk
them
all
day
without
making
an
it
must
be
nice
to
feel
so
happy
after
so
many
months
of
the
indeed
it
is
shirley
you
see
until
very
recently
i
was
very
much
worried
as
to
your
attitude
toward
me
i
could
believe
you
so
far
forget
yourself
as
to
love
me
in
spite
of
everything
so
i
never
took
the
trouble
to
ask
you
and
now
i
do
have
to
ask
you
i
know
and
i
be
around
to
see
you
after
i
get
that
crossing
in
you
perfectly
horrid
she
blazed
and
hung
up
without
the
formality
of
saying
chapter
xxxiv
shortly
after
shirley
departure
from
his
office
bryce
had
a
visit
from
buck
ogilvy
the
latter
wore
a
neatly
pressed
suit
of
shepherd
plaid
with
a
white
carnation
in
his
lapel
and
he
was
apparently
the
most
young
man
in
humboldt
county
he
struck
an
attitude
and
demanded
boss
what
do
you
think
of
my
new
suit
you
lunatic
do
you
know
red
blonds
should
never
wear
light
shades
you
dressed
like
a
negro
well
i
feel
as
happy
as
an
and
by
the
way
you
all
chirked
up
yourself
who
been
helping
you
to
the
elixir
of
life
when
we
parted
last
night
you
were
forty
fathoms
deep
in
the
slough
of
no
less
a
divinity
than
miss
shirley
sumner
she
called
this
morning
to
explain
that
last
night
fiasco
was
none
of
her
making
and
quite
innocently
she
imparted
the
information
that
old
pennington
lighted
out
for
san
francisco
at
one
this
morning
wherefore
i
laugh
three
long
loud
raucous
cheers
for
uncle
he
gone
to
rush
a
restraining
order
through
the
united
states
district
court
wonder
why
he
did
wire
his
attorneys
to
attend
to
the
matter
for
he
has
the
crossing
blocked
and
inasmuch
as
the
mayor
feeds
out
of
pennington
hand
the
colonel
is
quite
confident
that
said
crossing
will
remain
blocked
as
for
the
restraining
order
well
if
one
wants
a
thing
well
done
one
should
do
it
all
that
does
explain
your
cheerful
attitude
oh
but
it
does
i
told
you
about
old
duncan
mctavish
father
have
i
ogilvy
nodded
and
bryce
continued
when
i
fired
the
old
scoundrel
for
boozing
it
almost
broke
his
heart
he
had
to
leave
humboldt
where
everybody
knew
him
so
he
wandered
down
into
mendocino
county
and
got
a
job
sticking
lumber
in
the
of
the
willits
lumber
company
he
been
there
two
months
now
and
i
am
informed
by
his
employer
that
old
mac
has
taken
a
drink
in
all
that
time
and
what
more
he
is
going
to
take
one
how
do
you
know
because
i
make
it
my
business
to
find
out
mac
was
the
finest
this
county
ever
knew
hence
you
do
not
assume
that
i
would
lose
the
old
scoundrel
without
making
a
fight
for
him
do
you
why
buck
he
been
on
the
cardigan
thirty
years
and
i
only
fired
him
in
order
to
reform
him
well
last
week
i
sent
one
of
mac
old
friends
down
to
willits
purposely
to
call
on
him
and
invite
him
out
a
time
but
mac
would
drink
with
him
no
sir
he
could
be
tempted
on
the
contrary
he
told
the
tempter
that
i
had
promised
to
give
him
back
his
job
if
he
remained
on
the
water
wagon
for
one
year
he
was
resolved
to
win
back
his
job
and
his
i
know
what
your
plan
is
ogilvy
interrupted
you
going
to
ask
duncan
mctavish
to
waylay
pennington
on
the
road
at
some
point
where
it
runs
through
the
timber
kidnap
him
and
hold
him
until
we
have
had
time
to
clear
the
crossing
and
cut
pennington
tracks
we
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
buck
continued
seriously
listen
now
to
father
words
of
wisdom
this
is
an
old
one
to
me
i
fought
at
crossings
before
now
and
whether
successful
or
defeated
i
have
always
learned
something
in
battle
did
you
hear
me
tell
that
girl
and
her
villainous
avuncular
relative
last
night
that
i
had
another
ace
up
my
kimono
bryce
nodded
that
was
not
brag
old
dear
i
had
the
ace
and
this
morning
i
played
it
wherefore
in
my
heart
there
is
that
peace
that
passeth
understanding
particularly
since
i
have
just
had
a
telegram
informing
me
that
my
ace
took
the
odd
he
opened
a
drawer
in
bryce
desk
and
reached
for
the
cigars
he
knew
were
there
not
at
all
a
bad
cigar
for
ten
cents
however
you
will
recall
that
from
the
very
instant
we
decided
to
cut
in
that
we
commenced
to
plan
against
interference
by
pennington
in
consequence
we
kept
or
tried
to
keep
our
decision
a
secret
however
there
existed
at
all
times
the
possibility
that
pennington
might
discover
our
benevolent
intentions
and
block
us
with
his
only
weapon
a
restraining
order
issued
by
the
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
now
one
of
the
most
delightful
things
i
know
about
a
court
is
that
it
is
open
to
all
men
seeking
justice
or
injustice
disguised
as
justice
also
there
is
a
wise
old
saw
to
the
effect
that
battles
are
won
by
the
fellow
who
gets
there
first
with
the
most
men
the
situation
from
the
start
was
absurdly
simple
if
pennington
got
to
the
district
court
first
we
were
lost
you
mean
you
got
there
first
exclaimed
bryce
i
did
by
the
very
simple
method
of
preparing
to
get
there
first
in
case
anything
slipped
something
did
slip
last
night
however
i
was
ready
so
all
i
had
to
do
was
press
the
button
for
as
omar
khayyam
remarked
shall
it
avail
a
man
if
he
buyeth
a
padlock
for
his
stable
after
his
favourite
stallion
hath
been
lifted
several
days
ago
my
boy
i
wrote
a
long
letter
to
our
attorney
in
san
francisco
explaining
every
detail
of
our
predicament
the
instant
i
received
that
temporary
franchise
from
the
city
council
i
mailed
a
certified
copy
of
it
to
our
attorney
also
then
in
anticipation
of
our
discovery
by
pennington
i
instructed
the
attorney
to
prepare
the
complaint
and
petition
for
a
restraining
order
against
seth
pennington
et
al
and
stand
by
to
rush
the
judge
with
it
the
instant
he
heard
from
me
well
about
the
time
old
pennington
started
for
san
francisco
this
morning
i
had
our
attorney
out
of
bed
and
on
the
telephone
at
nine
this
morning
he
appeared
in
the
united
states
district
court
at
the
judge
signed
a
restraining
order
forbidding
our
enemies
to
interfere
with
us
in
the
exercise
of
a
right
legally
granted
us
by
the
city
of
sequoia
and
at
a
deputy
united
states
marshal
started
in
an
automobile
for
sequoia
via
the
overland
route
he
will
arrive
late
night
and
on
sunday
we
will
get
that
locomotive
out
of
our
way
and
install
our
and
pennington
ah
the
poor
pennington
mon
pauvre
seth
buck
sighed
comically
he
will
be
just
hours
you
old
bryce
murmured
you
wicked
wicked
man
buck
ogilvy
lifted
his
lapel
and
sniffed
luxuriously
at
his
white
carnation
the
while
a
thin
little
smile
played
around
the
corners
of
his
humorous
mouth
ah
he
murmured
presently
life
pretty
sweet
is
it
chapter
xxxv
events
followed
each
other
with
refreshing
rapidity
while
the
crew
of
the
big
locomotive
on
the
crossing
busied
themselves
getting
up
steam
sexton
and
jules
rondeau
toiled
at
the
loading
of
the
discarded
boiler
and
heavy
castings
aboard
two
by
utilizing
the
steel
derrick
on
the
company
this
task
was
completed
by
noon
and
after
luncheon
the
mogul
backed
up
the
main
line
past
the
switch
into
the
laguna
grande
yards
whereupon
the
kicked
the
two
and
the
out
of
the
yard
and
down
to
the
crossing
where
the
obstructions
were
promptly
unloaded
the
police
watched
the
operation
with
alert
interest
but
forebore
to
interfere
in
this
closing
of
a
public
thoroughfare
to
sexton
annoyance
and
secret
apprehension
bryce
cardigan
and
buck
ogilvy
promptly
appeared
on
the
scene
both
very
cheerful
and
lavish
with
expert
advice
as
to
the
best
method
of
expediting
the
job
in
hand
to
bryce
surprise
jules
rondeau
appeared
to
take
secret
enjoyment
of
this
chaffing
of
the
laguna
grande
manager
occasionally
he
eyed
bryce
curiously
but
without
animus
and
presently
he
flashed
the
latter
a
lightning
wink
as
if
to
say
what
a
fool
sexton
is
to
oppose

chapter
xxxvi
at
eleven
saturday
night
the
deputy
united
states
marshal
arrived
in
sequoia
upon
the
advice
of
buck
ogilvy
however
he
made
no
attempt
at
service
that
night
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
jules
rondeau
and
his
bullies
still
guarded
the
crossing
at
eight
sunday
morning
however
bryce
cardigan
drove
him
down
to
the
crossing
buck
ogilvy
was
already
there
with
his
men
superintending
the
erection
of
a
huge
derrick
close
to
the
heap
of
obstructions
placed
on
the
crossing
sexton
was
watching
him
uneasily
and
flushed
as
ogilvy
pointed
him
out
to
the
marshal
there
your
meat
marshal
he
announced
the
marshal
approached
and
extended
toward
sexton
a
copy
of
the
restraining
order
the
latter
struck
it
aside
and
refused
to
accept
it
whereupon
the
deputy
marshal
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
with
it
tag
you
out
of
the
game
my
friend
he
said
pleasantly
as
the
document
fluttered
to
sexton
feet
the
latter
turned
to
jules
rondeau
i
can
no
longer
take
charge
here
rondeau
he
explained
i
am
forbidden
to

lak
the
deputy
marshal
handed
rondeau
a
paper
at
the
same
time
showing
his
badge
you
out
too
my
friend
he
laughed
do
be
foolish
and
try
to
buck
the
law
if
you
do
i
shall
have
to
place
a
nice
little
pair

little
restraining

foresight
so
it
is
useless
to
try
to
beat
this
game
on
a
sexton
who
still
lingered
made
a
gesture
of
surrender
dismiss
your
crew
rondeau
he
ordered
we
whipped
to
a
a
gleam
of
pleasure
not
unmixed
with
triumph
lighted
the
dark
eyes
of
the
i
tol
sexton

not

he
said
simply
now
mebbe
he
believe
that
jules
rondeau

up
sexton
roared
petulantly
rondeau
shrugged
contemptuously
turned
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
great
arm
indicated
to
his
men
that
they
were
to
go
then
without
a
backward
glance
to
see
that
they
followed
the
strode
away
in

direction
of

repeated
once
more

in

ears
he
raised
his
right
hand
much
as
a
bear
raises
its
paw
his
blunt
fingers
worked
a
little
and
there
was
a
smoldering
fire
in
his
dark
eyes
without
further
protest
sexton
opened
the
safe
counted
out
the
wages

took

closed
over

quite
as
easily
as
a
woman
dresses
a
baby
he
gagged
sexton
with
sexton
own
handkerchief
laid
him
gently
on
the
floor
and
departed
locking
the
door
behind
him
and
taking
the
key
at
the
corner
of
the
building
where
the
entered
the
office
he
paused
jerked
once
at
the
wire
and
passed
on
leaving
the
broken
ends
on
the
ground
in
the
he
found
the
crew
on
duty
waiting
for
steam
in
the
boiler
the
withdrawal
of
both
locomotives
brief
as
had
been
their
absence
had
caused
a
glut
of
logs
at
the
laguna
grande
landings
and
sexton
was
catching
up
with
the
traffic
by
sending
the
crew
out
for
one
even
though
it
was
sunday
the
crew
had
been
used
to
receiving
orders
from
rondeau
and
moreover
they
were
not
aware
of
his
recent
action
hence
at
his
command
they
ran
the
out
of
the
roundhouse
coupled
up
the
two
and
the
and
backed
down
to
the
crossing
upon
arrival
jules
rondeau
leaned
out
of
the
cab
window
and
hailed

he
said

stepped
over
to
the
and
looked
up
at
his

by
whose

he
queried
mine

answered
sexton

he
did
he
waited
not
for
a
confirmation
from
his
new
master
but
proceeded
to
direct
operations
like
the
born
driver
and
leader
of
men
that
he
was
with
his
late
employer
gear
he
fastened
to
the
old
castings
and
the
boiler
lifted
them
with
the
derrick
on
the
and
swung
them
up
and
around
onto
the
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
crossing
was
once
more
clear
then
the
cardigan
crew
fell
upon
it
while
jules
rondeau
ran
the
train
back
to
the
laguna
grande
yards
dismissed
his
crew
returned
to
the
and
released

xxxvii
colonel
pennington
discovery
at
san
francisco
that
bryce
cardigan
had
stolen
his
thunder
and
turned
the
bolt
upon
him
was
the
hardest
blow
seth
pennington
could
remember
having
received
throughout
years
of
give
and
take
he
was
too
old
and
experienced
a
campaigner
however
to
permit
a
futile
rage
to
cloud
his
reason
he
prided
himself
upon
being
a
foeman
worthy
of
any
man
steel
on
tuesday
he
returned
to
sequoia
sexton
related
to
him
in
detail
the
events
which
had
transpired
since
his
departure
but
elicited
nothing
more
than
a
noncommittal
grunt
there
is
one
more
matter
sir
which
will
doubtless
be
of
interest
to
you
sexton
continued
apologetically
miss
sumner
called
me
on
the
telephone
yesterday
and
instructed
me
formally
to
notify
the
board
of
directors
of
the
laguna
grande
company
of
a
special
meeting
of
the
board
to
be
held
here
at
two
this
afternoon
in
view
of
the
impossibility
of
communicating
with
you
while
you
were
en
route
i
conformed
to
her
wishes
our
as
you
know
stipulate
that
no
meeting
of
the
board
shall
be
called
without
formal
written
notice
to
each
director
mailed
hours
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
sexton
by
conforming
to
her
wishes
miss
sumner
is
not
a
director
of
this
pennington
voice
was
harsh
and
trembled
with
apprehension
miss
sumner
controls
forty
per
cent
of
the
laguna
grande
stock
sir
i
took
that
into
you
lie
pennington
all
but
screamed
you
took
into
consideration
your
job
as
secretary
and
general
manager
damnation
he
rose
and
commenced
pacing
up
and
down
his
office
suddenly
he
paused
sexton
still
stood
beside
his
desk
watching
him
respectfully
you
fool
he
snarled
get
out
of
here
and
leave
me
sexton
departed
promptly
glancing
at
his
watch
as
he
did
so
it
lacked
five
minutes
of
two
he
passed
shirley
sumner
in
the
general
office
shirley
pennington
began
in
a
hoarse
voice
as
she
entered
his
office
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
directors
meeting
you
have
requested
be
seated
uncle
seth
the
girl
answered
quietly
if
you
will
only
be
quiet
and
reasonable
perhaps
we
can
dispense
with
this
meeting
which
appears
to
frighten
you
he
sat
down
promptly
a
look
of
relief
on
his
face
i
scarcely
know
how
to
begin
uncle
seth
shirley
commenced
sadly
it
hurts
me
terribly
to
be
forced
to
hurt
you
but
there
does
appear
to
be
any
other
way
out
of
it
i
can
not
trust
you
to
manage
my
financial
affairs
in
the
future
this
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
principal
one
being
young
cardigan
he
interrupted
in
a
low
voice
i
suppose
so
she
answered
although
i
did
think
until
very
recently
that
it
was
those
sixteen
townships
of
red
cedar
that
crown
grant
in
british
columbia
in
which
you
induced
me
to
invest
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
you
will
remember
that
you
purchased
that
timber
for
me
from
the
caribou
timber
company
limited
you
said
it
was
an
unparalleled
investment
quite
recently
i
learned
no
matter
how
that
you
were
the
principal
owner
of
the
caribou
timber
company
limited
smart
as
you
are
somebody
swindled
you
with
that
red
cedar
it
was
a
wonderful
stand
of
timber
so
read
the
cruiser
report
but
fifty
per
cent
of
it
despite
its
green
and
flourishing
appearance
is
and
the
remaining
fifty
per
cent
of
sound
timber
can
not
be
logged
unless
the
rotten
timber
is
logged
also
and
gotten
out
of
the
way
also
and
i
am
informed
that
logging
it
spells
she
gazed
upon
him
steadily
but
without
malice
his
face
crimsoned
and
then
paled
presently
his
glance
sought
the
carpet
while
he
struggled
to
formulate
a
verbal
defense
against
her
accusation
shirley
continued
you
had
erected
a
huge
sawmill
and
built
and
equipped
a
before
you
discovered
you
had
been
swindled
so
in
order
to
save
as
much
as
possible
from
the
wreck
you
decided
to
unload
your
white
elephant
on
somebody
else
i
was
the
readiest
victim
you
were
the
executor
of
my
father
estate
you
were
my
guardian
and
financial
adviser
and
so
you
found
it
very
very
easy
to
swindle
me
i
had
my
back
to
the
wall
he
quavered
i
was
desperate
and
it
was
at
all
the
bad
investment
you
have
been
told
it
is
you
had
the
money
more
money
than
you
knew
what
to
do
with
and
with
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
those
cedar
lands
i
knew
i
could
make
an
investment
in
california
redwood
and
more
than
retrieve
my
fortunes
make
big
money
for
both
of
you
might
have
borrowed
the
money
from
me
you
know
i
have
never
hesitated
to
join
in
your
this
was
too
big
a
deal
for
you
shirley
i
had
vision
i
could
see
incalculable
riches
in
this
redwood
empire
but
it
was
a
tremendous
gamble
and
required
twenty
millions
to
swing
it
at
the
very
start
i
dreamed
of
the
control
of
california
redwood
and
if
you
will
stand
by
me
shirley
i
shall
yet
make
my
dream
come
true
and
half
of
it
shall
be
yours
it
has
always
been
my
intention
to
buy
back
from
you
secretly
and
at
a
nice
profit
to
you
that
caribou
red
cedar
and
with
the
acquisition
of
the
cardigan
properties
i
would
have
been
in
position
to
do
so
why
that
cardigan
tract
in
the
san
hedrin
which
we
will
buy
in
within
a
year
for
half
a
million
is
worth
five
millions
at
least
and
by
that
time
i
feel
certain
in
fact
i
know
the
northern
pacific
will
commence
building
in
from
the
south
from
she
silenced
him
with
a
disdainful
gesture
you
shall
not
smash
the
cardigans
she
declared
firmly
i
shall
he
began
but
he
paused
abruptly
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that
tact
and
not
pugnacity
was
the
requirement
for
the
handling
of
this
ticklish
situation
you
are
devoid
of
mercy
of
a
sense
of
sportsmanship
now
then
uncle
seth
listen
to
me
you
have
hours
in
which
to
make
up
your
mind
whether
to
accept
my
ultimatum
or
refuse
it
if
you
refuse
i
shall
prosecute
you
for
fraud
and
a
betrayal
of
trust
as
my
father
executor
on
that
timber
he
brightened
a
trifle
i
afraid
that
would
be
a
long
hard
row
to
hoe
my
dear
and
of
course
i
shall
have
to
defend
in
addition
the
girl
went
on
quietly
the
county
grand
jury
shall
be
furnished
with
a
stenographic
report
of
your
conversation
of
thursday
night
with
mayor
poundstone
that
will
not
be
a
long
hard
row
to
hoe
uncle
seth
for
in
addition
to
the
stenographer
i
have
another
very
reliable
witness
judge
moore
your
casual
disposal
of
my
sedan
as
a
bribe
to
the
mayor
will
be
hard
to
explain
and
rather
amusing
in
view
of
the
fact
that
bryce
cardigan
managed
to
frighten
poundstone
into
returning
the
sedan
while
you
were
away
and
if
that
is
not
sufficient
for
my
purposes
i
have
the
sworn
confession
of
the
black
minorca
that
you
gave
him
five
hundred
dollars
to
kill
bryce
cardigan
your
rondeau
will
also
swear
that
you
approached
him
with
a
proposition
to
do
away
with
bryce
cardigan
i
think
therefore
that
you
will
readily
see
how
impossible
a
situation
you
have
managed
to
create
and
will
not
disagree
with
me
when
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
leave
this
his
face
had
gone
gray
and
haggard
i
ca
he
murmured
i
leave
this
great
business
now
your
own
interests
in
the
company
render
such
a
course
unthinkable
without
my
hand
at
the
helms
things
will
go
to
i
risk
that
i
want
to
get
rid
of
that
worthless
timber
so
i
think
you
had
better
buy
it
back
from
me
at
the
same
figure
at
which
you
sold
it
to
but
i
have
the
money
and
i
ca
borrow
it
i
i
i
will
have
the
equivalent
in
stock
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
you
will
call
on
judge
moore
to
complete
the
transaction
and
leave
with
him
your
resignation
as
president
of
the
laguna
grande
lumber
the
colonel
raised
his
glance
and
bent
it
upon
her
in
cold
appraisal
she
met
it
with
firmness
and
the
thought
came
to
him
she
is
a
pennington
and
hope
died
out
in
his
heart
he
began
pleading
in
maudlin
fashion
for
mercy
for
compromise
but
the
girl
was
obdurate
i
am
showing
you
more
mercy
than
you
deserve
you
to
whom
mercy
was
ever
a
sign
of
weakness
of
vacillation
there
is
a
gulf
between
us
uncle
seth
a
gulf
which
for
a
long
time
i
have
dimly
sensed
and
which
because
of
my
recent
discoveries
has
widened
until
it
can
no
longer
be
he
wrung
his
hands
in
desperation
and
suddenly
slid
to
his
knees
before
her
with
hypocritical
endearments
he
strove
to
take
her
hand
but
she
drew
away
from
him
do
touch
me
she
cried
sharply
and
with
a
breaking
note
in
her
voice
you
planned
to
kill
bryce
cardigan
and
for
that
and
that
alone
i
shall
never
forgive
she
fled
from
the
office
leaving
him
cringing
and
grovelling
on
the
floor
there
will
be
no
directors
meeting
sexton
she
informed
the
manager
as
she
passed
through
the
general
office
it
is
chapter
xxxviii
that
trying
interview
with
her
uncle
had
wrenched
shirley
soul
to
a
degree
that
left
her
faint
and
weak
she
at
once
set
out
on
a
long
drive
in
the
hope
that
before
she
turned
homeward
again
she
might
regain
something
of
her
customary
composure
presently
the
street
gave
way
to
a
dirt
road
and
terminated
abruptly
at
the
boundaries
of
a
field
that
sloped
gently
upward
a
field
studded
with
huge
black
redwood
stumps
showing
dismally
through
coronets
of
young
redwoods
that
grew
riotously
around
the
base
of
the
departed
parent
trees
from
the
fringe
of
the
thicket
thus
formed
the
terminus
of
an
old
showed
and
a
signboard
freshly
painted
pointed
the
way
to
the
valley
of
the
giants
shirley
had
not
intended
to
come
here
but
now
that
she
had
arrived
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
here
she
wanted
to
come
parking
her
car
by
the
side
of
the
road
she
alighted
and
proceeded
up
the
old
skid
now
newly
planked
and
with
the
encroaching
forestration
cut
away
so
that
the
daylight
might
enter
from
above
on
over
the
gentle
divide
she
went
and
down
toward
the
amphitheatre
where
the
primeval
giants
grew
and
as
she
approached
it
the
sound
that
is
silence
in
the
redwoods
the
thunderous
diapason
of
the
centuries
wove
its
spell
upon
her
quickly
imperceptibly
there
faded
from
her
mind
the
memory
of
that
grovelling
thing
she
had
left
behind
in
the
and
in
its
place
there
came
a
subtle
peace
a
feeling
of
awe
of
wonder
such
a
feeling
indeed
as
must
come
to
one
in
the
realization
that
man
is
distant
but
god
is
near
a
cluster
of
wild
orchids
pendent
from
the
great
roots
of
a
giant
challenged
her
attention
she
gathered
them
farther
on
in
a
spot
where
a
shaft
of
sunlight
fell
she
plucked
an
armful
of
golden
california
poppies
and
flaming
rhododendron
and
with
her
delicate
burden
she
came
at
length
to
the
clearing
where
the
halo
of
sunlight
fell
upon
the
grave
of
bryce
cardigan
mother
there
were
red
roses
on
it
a
couple
of
dozen
at
least
and
these
she
rearranged
in
order
to
make
room
for
her
own
offering
poor
dear
she
murmured
audibly
god
did
spare
you
for
much
happiness
did
he
a
voice
deep
resonant
kindly
spoke
a
few
feet
away
who
is
it
shirley
startled
turned
swiftly
seated
across
the
little
amphitheatre
in
a
lumberjack
fashioned
from
an
old
barrel
john
cardigan
sat
his
sightless
gaze
bent
upon
her
who
is
it
he
repeated
shirley
sumner
she
answered
you
do
not
know
me
no
replied
he
i
do
not
that
is
a
name
i
have
heard
however
you
are
seth
pennington
niece
is
someone
with
you
i
am
quite
alone
and
why
did
you
come
here
alone
he
queried
i
i
wanted
to
you
mean
you
wanted
to
think
clearly
my
dear
ah
yes
this
is
the
place
for
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
you
were
thinking
aloud
miss
shirley
sumner
i
heard
you
you
said
dear
god
did
spare
you
for
much
happiness
did
he
and
i
think
you
rearranged
my
roses
did
i
have
them
on
her
grave
yes
cardigan
i
was
merely
making
room
for
some
wild
flowers
i
had
indeed
then
you
knew
about
her
being
yes
sir
some
ten
years
ago
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
i
met
your
son
bryce
he
gave
me
a
ride
on
his
indian
pony
and
we
came
here
so
i
well
i
declare
ten
years
ago
eh
you
met
eh
you
met
bryce
since
his
return
to
sequoia
i
believe
he
quite
a
fellow
he
is
john
cardigan
nodded
sagely
so
that
why
you
thought
aloud
he
remarked
impersonally
bryce
told
you
about
her
you
are
right
miss
shirley
sumner
god
did
give
her
much
time
for
happiness
just
three
years
but
oh
such
wonderful
years
such
wonderful
years
it
was
mighty
fine
of
you
to
bring
flowers
he
announced
presently
i
appreciate
that
i
wish
i
could
see
you
you
must
be
a
dear
nice
thoughtful
girl
wo
you
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
i
should
be
glad
to
she
answered
and
seated
herself
on
the
brown
carpet
of
redwood
twigs
close
to
his
chair
so
you
came
up
here
to
do
a
little
clear
thinking
he
continued
in
his
deliberate
amiable
tones
do
you
come
here
often
this
is
the
third
time
in
ten
years
she
answered
i
feel
that
i
have
no
business
to
intrude
here
this
is
your
shrine
and
strangers
should
not
profane
i
think
i
should
have
resented
the
presence
of
any
other
person
miss
sumner
i
resented
you
until
you
i
glad
you
said
that
cardigan
it
sets
me
at
i
had
been
up
here
for
nearly
two
years
until
recently
you
see
i
i
do
own
the
valley
of
the
giants
any
indeed
to
whom
have
you
sold
it
i
do
not
know
miss
sumner
i
had
to
sell
there
was
no
other
way
out
of
the
jam
bryce
and
i
were
in
so
i
sacrificed
my
sentiment
for
my
boy
however
the
new
owner
has
been
wonderfully
kind
and
thoughtful
she
reorganized
that
old
so
even
an
old
blind
duffer
like
me
can
find
his
way
in
and
out
without
getting
lost
and
she
had
this
made
for
me
i
have
told
judge
moore
who
represents
the
unknown
owner
to
extend
my
thanks
to
his
client
but
words
are
so
empty
shirley
sumner
if
that
new
owner
could
only
understand
how
truly
grateful
i
am
how
profoundly
her
courtesy
touches
me
her
courtesy
shirley
echoed
did
a
woman
buy
the
giants
he
smiled
down
at
her
why
certainly
who
but
a
woman
and
a
dear
kind
thoughtful
woman
would
have
thought
to
have
this
chair
made
and
brought
up
here
for
me
fell
a
long
silence
between
them
then
john
cardigan
trembling
hand
went
groping
out
toward
the
girl
why
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
guessed
it
immediately
he
said
you
are
the
new
owner
my
dear
child
if
the
silent
prayers
of
a
very
unhappy
old
man
will
bring
blessing
on
you
there
there
girl
i
did
intend
to
make
you
weep
what
a
tender
heart
it
is
to
be
sure
she
took
his
great
hand
and
her
hot
tears
fell
on
it
for
his
gentleness
his
benignancy
had
touched
her
deeply
oh
you
must
not
tell
anybody
you
must
she
cried
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
as
she
knelt
before
him
good
land
of
love
girl
what
made
you
do
it
why
should
a
girl
like
you
give
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
my
valley
of
the
giants
were
you
hesitatingly
your
uncle
agent
no
i
bought
it
myself
with
my
own
money
my
uncle
does
know
i
am
the
new
owner
you
see
he
wanted
it
for
ah
yes
i
suspected
as
much
a
long
time
ago
your
uncle
is
the
modern
type
of
business
man
not
very
much
of
an
idealist
i
afraid
but
tell
me
why
you
decided
to
thwart
the
plans
of
your
i
knew
it
hurt
you
terribly
to
sell
your
giants
they
were
dear
to
you
for
sentimental
reasons
i
understood
also
why
you
were
forced
to
sell
so
i
well
i
decided
the
giants
would
be
safer
in
my
possession
than
in
my
uncle
in
all
probability
he
would
have
logged
this
valley
for
the
sake
of
the
clear
boards
he
could
get
from
these
that
does
not
explain
satisfactorily
to
me
why
you
took
sides
with
a
stranger
against
your
own
kin
john
cardigan
persisted
there
must
be
a
deeper
and
more
potent
reason
miss
shirley
well
shirley
made
answer
glad
that
he
could
not
see
the
flush
of
confusion
and
embarrassment
that
crimsoned
her
cheek
when
i
came
to
sequoia
last
may
your
son
and
i
met
quite
accidentally
the
stage
to
sequoia
had
already
gone
and
he
was
gracious
enough
to
invite
me
to
make
the
journey
in
his
car
then
we
recalled
having
met
as
children
and
presently
i
gathered
from
his
conversation
that
he
and
his
as
he
called
you
were
very
dear
to
each
other
i
was
witness
to
your
meeting
that
night
i
saw
him
take
you
in
his
big
arms
and
hold
you
tight
because
you
gone
blind
while
he
was
away
having
a
good
time
and
you
had
told
him
i
thought
that
was
brave
of
you
and
later
when
bryce
and
moira
mctavish
told
me
about
you
how
kind
you
were
how
you
felt
your
responsibility
toward
your
employees
and
the
community
well
i
just
could
help
a
leaning
toward
and
boy
because
the
boy
was
so
fine
and
true
to
his
ah
he
a
man
he
is
indeed
old
john
cardigan
murmured
proudly
i
dare
say
you
never
get
to
know
him
intimately
but
if
you
should
i
know
him
intimately
she
corrected
him
he
saved
my
life
the
day
the
ran
away
and
that
was
another
reason
i
owed
him
a
debt
and
so
did
my
uncle
but
uncle
would
pay
his
share
and
i
had
to
pay
for
wonderful
murmured
john
cardigan
wonderful
but
still
you
told
me
why
you
paid
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
giants
when
you
could
have
bought
them
for
fifty
thousand
you
had
a
woman
reason
i
dare
say
and
women
always
reason
from
the
heart
never
the
head
however
if
you
do
not
care
to
tell
me
i
shall
not
insist
perhaps
i
have
appeared
unduly
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
she
answered
a
gentle
prescient
smile
fringed
his
old
mouth
he
wagged
his
leonine
head
as
if
to
say
why
should
i
ask
when
i
know
fell
again
a
restful
silence
then
am
i
allowed
one
guess
miss
shirley
sumner
yes
but
you
would
never
guess
the
i
am
a
very
wise
old
man
when
one
sits
in
the
dark
one
sees
much
that
was
hidden
from
him
in
the
full
glare
of
the
light
my
son
is
proud
manly
independent
and
the
soul
of
honour
he
needed
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
you
knew
it
probably
your
uncle
informed
you
you
wanted
to
loan
him
some
money
but
you
could
you
feared
to
offend
him
by
proffering
it
had
you
proffered
it
he
would
have
declined
it
so
you
bought
my
valley
of
the
giants
at
a
preposterous
price
and
kept
your
action
a
and
he
patted
her
hand
gently
as
if
to
silence
any
denial
while
far
down
the
a
voice
a
baritone
floated
faintly
to
them
through
the
forest
somebody
was
singing
or
rather
chanting
a
singularly
tuneless
refrain
wild
and
barbaric
what
is
that
shirley
cried
that
is
my
son
coming
to
fetch
his
old
daddy
home
replied
john
cardigan
that
thing
he
howling
is
an
indian
or
paean
of
triumph
something
his
nurse
taught
him
when
he
wore
pinafores
if
you
excuse
me
miss
shirley
sumner
i
leave
you
now
i
generally
contrive
to
meet
him
on
the
he
bade
her
and
started
down
the
trail
his
stick
tapping
against
the
old
stretched
from
tree
to
tree
beside
the
trail
and
marking
it
shirley
was
tremendously
relieved
she
did
not
wish
to
meet
bryce
cardigan
and
she
was
distinctly
grateful
to
john
cardigan
for
his
nice
consideration
in
sparing
her
an
interview
she
seated
herself
in
the
lumberjack
so
lately
vacated
and
chin
in
hand
gave
herself
up
to
meditation
on
this
extraordinary
old
man
and
his
extraordinary
son
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
down
the
trail
bryce
met
his
father
hello
john
cardigan
he
called
what
do
you
mean
by
skallyhooting
through
these
woods
without
a
pilot
eh
explain
your
reckless
you
great
overgrown
duffer
his
father
retorted
affectionately
i
thought
you
never
he
reached
into
his
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
but
failed
to
find
it
and
searched
through
another
pocket
and
still
another
by
gravy
son
he
remarked
presently
i
do
believe
i
left
my
silk
handkerchief
the
one
moira
gave
me
for
my
last
birthday
up
yonder
i
would
lose
that
handkerchief
for
a
farm
skip
along
and
find
it
for
me
son
i
wait
for
you
here
do
i
be
back
in
a
pig
whisper
his
son
replied
and
started
briskly
up
the
trail
while
his
father
leaned
against
a
madrone
tree
and
smiled
his
prescient
little
smile
bryce
brisk
step
on
the
thick
carpet
of
withered
brown
twigs
aroused
shirley
from
her
reverie
when
she
looked
up
he
was
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
little
amphitheatre
gazing
at
her
you
you
she
stammered
and
rose
as
if
to
flee
from
him
the
governor
sent
me
back
to
look
for
his
handkerchief
shirley
he
explained
he
did
tell
me
you
were
here
guess
he
did
hear
he
advanced
smilingly
toward
her
i
tremendously
glad
to
see
you
shirley
he
said
and
paused
beside
her
fate
has
been
singularly
kind
to
me
indeed
i
been
pondering
all
day
as
to
just
how
i
was
to
arrange
a
private
and
confidential
little
chat
with
you
without
calling
upon
you
at
your
uncle
i
do
feel
like
chatting
she
answered
a
little
drearily
and
then
he
noted
her
wet
lashes
instantly
he
was
on
one
knee
beside
her
with
the
amazing
confidence
that
had
always
distinguished
him
in
her
eyes
his
big
left
arm
went
around
her
and
when
her
hands
went
to
her
face
he
drew
them
gently
away
i
waited
too
long
sweetheart
he
murmured
thank
god
i
can
tell
you
at
last
all
the
things
that
have
been
accumulating
in
my
heart
i
love
you
shirley
i
loved
you
from
that
first
day
we
met
at
the
station
and
all
these
months
of
strife
and
repression
have
merely
served
to
make
me
love
you
the
more
perhaps
you
have
been
all
the
dearer
to
me
because
you
seemed
so
hopelessly
he
drew
her
head
down
on
his
breast
his
great
hand
patted
her
hot
cheek
his
honest
brown
eyes
gazed
earnestly
wistfully
into
hers
i
love
you
he
whispered
all
that
i
have
all
that
i
am
all
that
i
hope
to
be
i
offer
to
you
shirley
sumner
and
in
the
shrine
of
my
heart
i
shall
hold
you
sacred
while
life
shall
last
you
are
not
indifferent
to
me
dear
i
know
you
not
but
tell
me
answer
me
her
violet
eyes
were
uplifted
to
his
and
in
them
he
read
the
answer
to
his
cry
ah
may
i
he
murmured
and
kissed
her
oh
my
dear
impulsive
gentle
big
sweetheart
she
whispered
and
then
her
arms
went
around
his
neck
and
the
fullness
of
her
happiness
found
vent
in
tears
he
did
not
seek
to
have
her
repress
in
the
safe
haven
of
his
arms
she
rested
and
there
quite
without
effort
or
distress
she
managed
to
convey
to
him
something
more
than
an
inkling
of
the
thoughts
that
were
wont
to
come
to
her
whenever
they
met
oh
my
love
he
cried
happily
i
had
dared
dream
of
such
happiness
until
you
were
so
unattainable
the
obstacles
between
us
were
so
many
and
so
great
why
bryce
she
interrupted
him
he
took
her
adorable
little
nose
in
his
great
thumb
and
forefinger
and
tweaked
it
gently
the
light
began
to
dawn
yesterday
my
dear
little
enemy
following
an
interesting
which
i
put
in
with
his
honour
the
mayor
acting
upon
suspicion
only
i
told
poundstone
i
was
prepared
to
send
him
to
the
if
he
did
behave
himself
in
the
matter
of
my
permanent
franchise
for
the
and
the
oily
old
invertebrate
wept
and
promised
me
anything
if
i
would
disgrace
him
so
i
promised
i
would
do
anything
until
the
franchise
matter
should
be
definitely
settled
after
which
i
returned
to
my
office
to
find
awaiting
me
there
no
less
a
person
than
the
man
for
the
northwestern
pacific
he
was
a
perfectly
delightful
young
fellow
and
he
had
a
proposition
to
unfold
it
seems
the
northwestern
pacific
has
decided
to
build
up
from
willits
and
all
that
powwow
and
publicity
of
buck
ogilvy
about
the
was
in
all
probability
the
very
thing
that
spurred
them
to
action
they
figured
the
was
back
of
the
that
it
was
to
be
the
first
link
of
a
chain
of
coast
roads
to
be
connected
ultimately
with
the
terminus
of
the
on
gray
harbour
washington
and
if
the
should
be
built
it
meant
that
a
rival
road
would
get
the
edge
on
them
in
the
matter
of
every
stick
of
humboldt
and
del
norte
redwood
and
they
be
left
holding
the
why
did
they
think
that
dear
that
amazing
rascal
buck
ogilvy
used
to
be
a
me
that
the
money
had
been
deposited
in
escrow
there
awaiting
formal
deed
that
money
puts
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
in
the
clear
no
receivership
for
us
now
my
dear
one
and
i
going
right
ahead
with
the
building
of
the
while
our
holdings
down
on
the
san
hedrin
double
in
value
for
the
reason
that
within
three
years
they
will
be
accessible
and
can
be
logged
over
the
rails
of
the
northwestern
pacific
bryce
shirley
declared
have
i
always
told
you
i
never
permit
you
to
build
the
of
course
he
replied
but
surely
you
going
to
withdraw
your
objections
i
am
not
you
must
choose
between
the
and
and
she
met
his
surprised
gaze
unflinchingly
shirley
you
do
mean
it
i
do
mean
it
i
have
always
meant
it
i
love
you
dear
but
for
all
that
you
must
not
build
that
he
stood
up
and
towered
above
her
sternly
i
must
build
it
shirley
i
contracted
to
do
it
and
i
must
keep
faith
with
gregory
of
the
trinidad
timber
company
he
putting
up
the
money
and
i
to
do
the
work
and
operate
the
line
i
ca
go
back
on
him
not
for
my
sake
she
pleaded
he
shook
his
head
i
must
go
on
he
reiterated
do
you
realize
what
that
resolution
means
to
us
the
girl
tones
were
grave
her
glance
graver
i
realize
what
it
means
to
me
she
came
closer
to
him
suddenly
the
blaze
in
her
violet
eyes
gave
way
to
one
of
mirth
oh
you
dear
big
booby
she
cried
i
was
just
testing
and
she
clung
to
him
laughing
you
always
beat
me
down
you
always
win
bryce
dear
i
the
laguna
grande
lumber
company
at
least
i
will
be
and
i
repeat
for
the
last
time
that
you
shall
not
build
the
because
i
going
to
oh
dear
i
shall
die
laughing
at
you
because
i
going
to
merge
with
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
and
then
my
railroad
shall
be
your
railroad
and
we
extend
it
and
haul
gregory
logs
to
tidewater
for
him
also
and
silly
did
i
tell
you
you
never
build
the
god
bless
my
mildewed
soul
he
murmured
and
drew
her
to
him
in
the
gathering
dusk
they
walked
down
the
trail
beside
the
madrone
tree
john
cardigan
waited
patiently
well
he
queried
when
they
joined
him
did
you
find
my
handkerchief
for
me
son
i
did
find
your
handkerchief
john
cardigan
bryce
answered
but
i
did
find
what
i
suspect
you
sent
me
back
for
and
that
is
a
perfectly
wonderful
for
john
cardigan
smiled
and
held
out
his
arms
for
her
this
he
said
is
the
happiest
day
that
i
have
known
since
my
boy
was
chapter
xxxix
colonel
seth
pennington
was
thoroughly
crushed
look
which
way
he
would
the
bedevilled
old
rascal
could
find
no
loophole
for
escape
you
win
cardigan
he
muttered
desperately
as
he
sat
in
his
office
after
shirley
had
left
him
you
had
more
than
a
shade
in
every
round
thus
far
and
at
the
finish
you
landed
a
clean
knockout
if
i
had
to
fight
any
man
but
you
he
sighed
resignedly
and
pressed
the
on
his
desk
sexton
entered
sexton
he
said
bluntly
and
with
a
slight
quiver
in
his
voice
my
niece
and
i
have
had
a
disagreement
we
have
quarrelled
over
young
cardigan
she
going
to
marry
him
now
our
affairs
are
somewhat
involved
and
in
order
to
straighten
them
out
we
spun
a
coin
to
see
whether
she
should
sell
her
stock
in
laguna
grande
to
me
or
whether
i
should
sell
mine
to
her
and
i
lost
the
of
the
stock
at
the
close
of
last
year
business
plus
ten
per
cent
will
determine
the
selling
price
and
i
shall
resign
as
president
you
will
in
all
probability
be
retained
to
manage
the
company
until
it
is
merged
with
the
cardigan
redwood
lumber
company
when
i
imagine
you
will
be
given
ample
notice
to
seek
a
new
job
elsewhere
call
miss
sumner
attorney
judge
moore
on
the
telephone
and
ask
him
to
come
to
the
office
at
nine
when
the
papers
can
be
drawn
up
and
signed
that
is
the
colonel
did
not
return
to
his
home
in
redwood
boulevard
that
night
he
had
no
appetite
for
dinner
and
sat
brooding
in
his
office
until
very
late
then
he
went
to
the
hotel
sequoia
and
engaged
a
room
he
did
not
possess
sufficient
courage
to
face
his
niece
again
at
four
the
next
day
the
colonel
his
baggage
his
automobile
his
chauffeur
and
the
solemn
butler
james
boarded
the
passenger
steamer
for
san
francisco
and
at
sailed
out
of
humboldt
bay
over
the
thundering
bar
and
on
into
the
south
the
colonel
was
still
a
rich
man
but
his
dream
of
a
redwood
empire
had
faded
and
once
more
he
was
taking
up
the
search
for
cheap
timber
whether
he
ever
found
it
or
not
is
a
matter
that
does
not
concern
us
at
a
moment
when
young
henry
poundstone
dream
of
legal
opulence
was
fading
when
mayor
poundstone
hopes
for
domestic
peace
had
been
shattered
beyond
repair
the
while
his
cheap
political
aspirations
had
been
equally
devastated
because
of
a
certain
damnable
document
in
the
possession
of
bryce
cardigan
many
events
of
importance
were
transpiring
on
the
veranda
of
his
home
john
cardigan
sat
tapping
the
floor
with
his
stick
and
dreaming
dreams
which
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
were
beside
him
shirley
sat
her
glance
bent
musingly
out
across
the
roofs
of
sequoia
and
on
to
the
bay
shore
where
the
smoke
and
floated
up
from
two
sawmills
her
own
and
bryce
cardigan
to
her
came
at
regularly
spaced
intervals
the
faint
whining
of
the
saws
and
the
rumble
of
crawling
out
on
the
high
over
the
piles
of
bright
freshly
sawed
lumber
she
caught
from
time
to
time
the
flash
of
white
spray
as
the
great
logs
tossed
from
the
trucks
hurtled
down
the
skids
and
crashed
into
the
bay
at
the
docks
of
both
mills
vessels
were
loading
their
tall
spars
cutting
the
skyline
above
and
beyond
the
smokestacks
far
down
the
bay
a
steam
schooner
loaded
until
her
was
almost
flush
with
the
water
was
putting
out
to
sea
and
shirley
heard
the
faint
echo
of
her
siren
as
she
whistled
her
intention
to
pass
to
starboard
of
a
inward
bound
in
tow
of
a
cardigan
tug
it
wonderful
she
said
presently
apropos
of
nothing
aye
he
replied
in
his
deep
melodious
voice
i
been
sitting
here
my
dear
listening
to
your
thoughts
you
know
something
now
of
the
tie
that
binds
my
boy
to
sequoia
this
he
waved
his
arm
abroad
in
the
darkness
this
is
the
true
essence
of
life
to
create
to
develop
the
gifts
that
god
has
given
us
to
work
and
know
the
blessing
of
weariness
to
have
dreams
and
see
them
come
true
that
is
life
and
i
have
lived
and
now
i
am
ready
to

smiled
wistfully
king

dead
long

the
king
i
wonder
if
you
raised
as
you
have
been
can
face
life
in
sequoia
resolutely
with
my
son
it
is
a
dull
drab
sawmill
town
where
life
unfolds
gradually
without
thrill
where
the
years
stretch
ahead
of
one
with
only
trees
among
simple
folk
the
life
may
be
hard
on
you
shirley
one
has
to
acquire
a
taste
for
it
you
i
have
known
the
lilt
of
battle
she
answered
hence
i
think
i
can
enjoy
the
sweets
of
victory
i
am
and
what
a
run
you
did
give
that
boy
bryce
she
laughed
softly
i
wanted
him
to
fight
i
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
the
stuff
that
was
in
him

logs

rascally
hide
and

to
say
about
it

dryly
i

eh
well
any
time

deny
me
the
privilege
of
hiring
and
firing
you
going
to
be
out

service
of
a
rattling
good
general
manager

me
responsible
for

must
select
the
tools

well
bryce
laughed

it
your
own
way
only
if
you
can
drive
duncan
mctavish
out
of
cardigan
woods
i
like
to
see
you
do
it
possession
is
nine
points
of
the
law
buck
and
old
duncan
is
in
what
do
you
mean
in
possession
i
mean
that
at
ten
this
morning
duncan
mctavish
appeared
at
our
the
was
all
gone
from
him
and
he
appeared
forty
years
old
instead
of
the
sixty
he
is
with
a
whoop
he
came
jumping
over
the
logs
straight
for
jules
rondeau
the
big
canuck
saw
him
coming
and
knew
what
his
visit
portended
so
he
was
taken
unawares
it
was
a
case
of
fight
for
his
job
and
rondeau
the
devil
you
say
i
do
and
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
it
was
a
rough
and
tumble
and
no
grips
barred
just
the
kind
of
fight
rondeau
likes
nevertheless
old
duncan
floored
him
while
he
been
away
somebody
taught
him
the
and
the
and
a
few
more
fancy
ones
and
he
got
to
work
on
rondeau
in
a
hurry
in
fact
he
had
to
for
if
the
tussle
had
gone
over
five
minutes
rondeau
youth
would
have
decided
the
and
rondeau
was
whipped
to
a
whisper
mac
floored
him
climbed
him
and
choked
him
until
he
beat
the
ground
with
his
free
hand
in
token
of
surrender
whereupon
old
duncan
let
him
up
and
rondeau
went
to
his
shanty
and
packed
his
turkey
the
last
i
saw
of
him
he
was
headed
over
the
hill
to
camp
two
on
laguna
grande
he
probably
chase
that
assistant
i
hired
after
the
consolidation
out
of
shirley
woods
and
help
himself
to
the
job
i
do
care
if
he
does
what
interests
me
is
the
fact
that
the
old
cardigan
is
back
on
the
job
in
cardigan
woods
and
mighty
glad
of
it
the
old
horsethief
has
had
his
lesson
and
will
remain
sober
hereafter
i
think
he
the
infamous
old
outlaw
mac
knows
the
san
hedrin
as
i
know
my
own
pocket
he
be
a
tower
of
strength
when
we
open
up
that
tract
after
the
railroad
builds
in
by
the
way
has
my
dad
been
down
this
morning
yes
moira
read
the
mail
to
him
and
then
took
him
up
to
the
valley
of
the
giants
he
said
he
wanted
to
do
a
little
quiet
figuring
on
that
new
steam
schooner
you
thinking
of
building
he
thinks
she
ought
to
be
bigger
big
enough
to
carry
two
million
bryce
glanced
at
his
watch
it
half
after
eleven
he
said
guess
i
run
up
to
the
giants
and
bring
him
home
to
he
stepped
into
the
napier
standing
outside
the
office
and
drove
away
buck
ogilvy
waited
until
bryce
was
out
of
sight
then
with
sudden
determination
he
entered
the
office
moira
he
said
abruptly
approaching
the
desk
where
she
worked
your
dad
is
back
and
what
more
bryce
cardigan
has
let
him
have
his
old
job

the
last
time

worse
than

rascal
of
a
father
of
yours
does
and
i
tell
you

not
have
you
go
back
to
the
woods
to
take
care
of
him

now
moira

me
a
definite
i
afraid
i
do
love
you
well
enough
to
marry
you
ogilvy
moira
pleaded
i
truly
fond
of
you
but
the
last
boat
gone
cried
ogilvy
desperately
i
answered
well

not
stick
around
here
much
longer
moira
i
realize
i
must
be
a
nuisance
but
i
ca
help
being
a
nuisance
when
you
near
me
so
i
quit
my
good
job
here
and
go
back
to
my
old
game
of
oh
you
would
quit
a
job
moira
cried
aghast
i
quit
a
job
i
desperate
enough
to
go
over
to
the
mill
and
pick
a
fight
with
the
big
bandsaw
i
going
away
where
i
see
you
your
eyes
are
driving
me
but
i
do
want
you
to
go
call
me
buck
he
commanded
sharply
i
do
want
you
to
go
buck
she
repeated
meekly
i
shall
feel
guilty
driving
you
out
of
a
fine
then
marry
me
and
i
but
suppose
i
do
love
you
the
way
you
deserve
suppose
suppose
buck
ogilvy
cried
you
no
longer
certain
of
yourself
how
dare
you
deny
your
love
for
me
eh
moira
i
risk
her
eyes
turned
to
him
timidly
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
in
their
smoky
depths
a
lambent
flame
i
do
know
she
quavered
and
it
a
big
responsibility
in
case
oh
the
devil
take
the
case
he
cried
rapturously
and
took
her
hands
in
his
do
i
improve
with
age
dear
moira
he
asked
with
boyish
eagerness
then
before
she
could
answer
he
swept
on
a
tornado
of
love
and
pleading
and
presently
moira
was
in
his
arms
he
was
kissing
her
and
she
was
crying
softly
because
well
she
admired
buck
ogilvy
more
she
respected
him
and
was
genuinely
fond
of
him
she
wondered
and
as
she
wondered
a
quiet
joy
thrilled
her
in
the
knowledge
that
it
did
not
seem
at
all
impossible
for
her
to
grow
in
time
absurdly
fond
of
this
wholesome
red
rascal
oh
buck
dear
she
whispered
i
do
know
i
sure
but
perhaps
i
loved
you
a
little
bit
for
a
long
i
perfectly
wild
over
you
you
the
most
wonderful
woman
i
ever
heard
of
old
and
he
pinched
them
just
to
see
the
colour
come
and
go
john
cardigan
was
seated
in
his
lumberjack
as
his
son
approached
his
hat
lay
on
the
litter
of
brown
twigs
beside
him
his
chin
was
sunk
on
his
breast
and
his
head
was
held
a
little
to
one
side
in
a
listening
attitude
a
vagrant
little
breeze
rustled
gently
a
lock
of
his
fine
long
white
hair
bryce
stooped
over
the
old
man
and
shook
him
gently
by
the
shoulder
wake
up
partner
he
called
cheerfully
but
john
cardigan
did
not
wake
and
again
his
son
shook
him
still
receiving
no
response
bryce
lifted
the
leonine
old
head
and
gazed
into
his
father
face
john
cardigan
he
cried
sharply
wake
up
old
the
old
eyes
opened
and
john
cardigan
smiled
up
at
his
boy
good
son
he
whispered
good
son
he
closed
his
sightless
eyes
again
as
if
the
mere
effort
of
holding
them
open
wearied
him
i
been
sitting
here
waiting
he
went
on
in
the
same
gentle
whisper
no
not
waiting
for
you
boy
waiting
his
head
fell
over
on
his
son
shoulder
his
hand
went
groping
for
bryce
listen
he
continued
ca
you
hear
it
the
silence
wait
for
you
here
my
son
mother
and
i
will
wait
together
now
in
this
spot
she
fancied
i
tired
i
want
rest
look
after
old
mac
and
moira
and
bill
dandy
who
lost
his
leg
at
camp
seven
last
fall
and
tom
ellington
children
and
all
the
others
son
you
know
bryce
your
responsibilities
sorry
i
ca
wait
to
see
the
san
hedrin
opened
up
but
i
lived
my
life
and
loved
my
love
ah
yes
i
been
happy
so
happy
just
doing
things
and
dreaming
here
among
my
giants
and
he
sighed
gently
good
son
he
whispered
again
his
big
body
relaxed
and
the
great
heart
of
the
argonaut
was
still
bryce
held
him
until
the
realization
came
to
him
that
his
father
was
no
more
that
like
a
watch
the
winding
of
which
has
been
neglected
he
had
gradually
slowed
up
and
stopped
old
he
murmured
you
escaped
into
the
light
at
last
we
go
home
together
now
but
we
come
back
and
with
his
father
body
in
his
strong
arms
he
departed
from
the
little
amphitheatre
walking
lightly
with
his
heavy
burden
down
the
old
to
the
waiting
automobile
and
two
days
later
john
cardigan
returned
to
rest
forever
with
his
lost
mate
among
the
giants
himself
at
last
an
infinitesimal
portion
of
that
tremendous
silence
that
is
the
diapason
of
the
ages
when
the
funeral
was
over
shirley
and
bryce
lingered
until
they
found
themselves
alone
beside
the
freshly
turned
earth
through
a
rift
in
the
great
branches
two
hundred
feet
above
a
patch
of
cerulean
sky
showed
faintly
the
sunlight
fell
like
a
broad
golden
shaft
over
the
grave
and
from
the
brown
trunk
of
an
adjacent
tree
a
gray
squirrel
a
descendant
perhaps
of
the
gray
squirrel
that
had
been
wont
to
rob
bryce
pockets
of
twenty
years
before
chirped
at
them
inquiringly
he
was
a
giant
among
men
said
bryce
presently
what
a
fitting
place
for
him
to
lie
he
passed
his
arm
around
his
wife
shoulders
and
drew
her
to
him
you
made
it
possible
she
gazed
up
at
him
in
adoration
and
presently
they
left
the
valley
of
the
giants
to
face
the
world
together
strong
in
their
faith
to
live
their
lives
and
love
their
loves
to
dream
their
dreams
and
perchance
when
life
should
be
done
with
and
the
hour
of
rest
at
hand
to
surrender
sustained
and
comforted
by
the
knowledge
that
those
dreams
had
come
true
the
end
