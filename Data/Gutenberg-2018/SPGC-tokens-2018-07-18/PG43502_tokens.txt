by
the
morning
post
butler
nearly
at
the
plans
lady

she
understand

farnborough
butler

i
afraid
i
scandalously
early
it
did
take
me
nearly
as
long
to
motor
over
as
lord
john
said
lady
john
i
afraid
my
husband
is
no
authority
on
motoring
and
he
not
home
yet
from
church
farn
it
the
greatest
luck
finding
i
thought
miss
levering
was
the
only
person
under
this
roof
who
was
ever
allowed
to
observe
sunday
as
a
real
day
of
rest
lady
john
if
you
come
to
see
miss
levering
farn
is
she
here
i
give
you
my
word
i
did
know
it
lady
john
oh
farn
does
she
come
every
lady
john
whenever
we
can
get
her
to
but
we
only
known
her
a
couple
of
months
farn
and
i
have
only
known
her
three
weeks
lady
john
i
come
to
ask
you
to
help
me
lady
john
with
miss
levering
i
ca
do
it
farn
no
no
all
that
no
good
she
only
laughs
lady
john
ah
she
looks
upon
you
as
a
boy
farn
such
rot
what
do
you
think
she
said
to
me
in
london
the
other
day
lady
john
that
she
was
four
years
older
than
you
farn
oh
i
knew
that
no
she
said
she
knew
she
was
all
the
charming
things
i
been
saying
but
there
was
only
one
way
to
prove
it
and
that
was
to
marry
some
one
young
enough
to
be
her
son
she
noticed
that
was
what
the
attractive
women
did
and
she
named
names
lady
john
were
too
old
farn
her
future
husband
she
said
was
probably
just
entering
eton
lady
john
just
like
her
farn
the
subject
no
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
the
secretaryship
lady
john
you
did
get
it
then
farn
no
it
the
grief
of
my
life
lady
john
oh
if
you
do
get
one
you
get
another
farn
but
there
only
one
lady
john
only
one
vacancy
farn
only
one
man
i
give
my
ears
to
work
for
lady
john
i
remember
farn
do
i
always
talk
about
stonor
well
it
a
habit
people
have
got
into
lady
john
i
forget
do
you
know
stonor
personally
or
are
you
just
dazzled
from
afar
farn
oh
i
know
him
the
trouble
is
he
does
know
me
if
he
did
realise
he
ca
be
sure
of
winning
his
election
without
my
valuable
services
lady
john
geoffrey
stonor
is
always
a
foregone
conclusion
farn
that
the
great
man
shares
that
opinion
is
precisely
his
weak
point
his
only
one
lady
john
you
think
because
the
liberals
swept
the
country
the
last
time
farn
how
can
we
be
sure
any
conservative
seat
is
safe
after
lady
john
and
turns
to
her
forgive
me
i
know
you
not
interested
in
politics
politics
but
this
concerns
geoffrey
stonor
lady
john
and
you
count
on
my
being
interested
in
him
like
all
the
rest
of
my
sex
farn
lady
john
i
heard
the
news
lady
john
what
news
farn
that
your
little
niece
the
scotch
heiress
is
going
to
become
geoffrey
stonor
lady
john
who
told
you
that
farn
please
do
mind
my
knowing
lady
john
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
having
a
few
days
with
just
her
family
in
the
secret
before
the
flood
of
congratulations
breaks
loose
farn
oh
that
all
right
i
always
hear
things
before
other
people
lady
john
well
i
must
ask
you
to
be
good
enough
to
be
very
circumspect
i
would
have
my
niece
think
that
i
farn
oh
of
course
not
lady
john
she
will
be
here
in
an
hour
farn
up
what
the
future
stonor
lady
john
yes
unfortunately
we
had
one
or
two
people
already
asked
for
the
farn
and
i
go
and
invite
myself
to
luncheon
lady
john
you
can
buy
me
off
i
promise
to
remove
myself
in
five
minutes
if
you
lady
john
no
the
penalty
is
you
shall
stay
and
keep
the
others
amused
between
church
and
luncheon
and
so
leave
me
free
up
the
only
farn
wild
horses
wo
get
a
hint
out
of
me
i
only
mentioned
it
to
you
because
since
we
come
back
to
live
in
this
part
of
the
world
you
been
so
awfully
kind
i
thought
i
hoped
maybe
you
you
put
in
a
word
for
me
lady
john
with
farn
with
your
nephew
that
is
to
be
though
i
the
slavish
satellite
people
make
out
you
ca
doubt
lady
john
oh
i
do
doubt
but
you
know
stonor
inspires
a
similar
enthusiasm
in
a
good
many
young
farn
they
have
studied
the
situation
as
i
have
they
do
know
what
at
stake
they
do
go
to
that
hole
dutfield
as
i
did
just
to
hear
his
friday
speech
lady
john
ah
but
you
were
rewarded
jean
my
niece
wrote
me
it
was
glorious
farn
well
you
know
was
disappointed
he
too
content
just
to
criticise
just
to
make
his
delicate
pungent
fun
of
the
men
who
are
grappling
very
inadequately
of
course
still
with
the
big
questions
there
a
carrying
power
up
and
faces
an
imaginary
some
of
stonor
friends
ought
to
point
it
out
there
a
driving
power
in
the
poorest
constructive
policy
that
makes
the
most
brilliant
criticism
look
barren
lady
john
who
told
you
that
farn
you
think
there
nothing
in
it
because
say
it
but
now
that
he
coming
into
the
family
lord
john
or
somebody
really
ought
to
point
out
stonor
overdoing
his
r√¥le
of
magnificent
security
lady
john
i
do
see
even
lord
john
offering
to
instruct
stonor
farn
believe
me
that
just
stonor
danger
nobody
saying
a
word
everybody
hoping
he
on
the
point
of
adopting
some
definite
line
something
strong
and
original
that
going
to
fire
the
public
imagination
and
bring
the
tories
back
into
power
lady
john
so
he
will
farn
not
if
he
disappoints
meetings
goes
calmly
up
to
town
and
leaves
the
field
to
the
liberals
lady
john
when
did
he
do
anything
like
that
farn
yesterday
a
harassed
and
now
that
he
got
this
other
preoccupation
lady
john
you
mean
farn
yes
your
niece
that
spoilt
child
of
fortune
of
course
she
kept
him
from
the
meeting
last
night
well
if
that
the
effect
she
going
to
have
it
pretty
serious
lady
john
are
farn
i
can
assure
you
the
election
agent
more
so
he
simply
tearing
his
hair
lady
john
gravely
and
coming
how
do
you
know
farn
he
told
me
so
himself
yesterday
i
scraped
acquaintance
with
the
agent
just
to
see
if
if
lady
john
it
not
only
here
that
you
manoeuvre
for
that
secretaryship
farn
you
can
never
tell
when
your
chance
might
come

election

through
the

minutes
that

hour
earlier

dawdling
through
the
park
with
the
church
brigade
farn
oh
a
glance
back

i
go
and
meet
them
farnborough
lord
j
he
turns
that
discreet
young
man
will
get
on
lady
john
jean
but
did
you
get
here
jean
he
motored
me
down
lady
john
geoffrey
stonor
jean
why
where
is
he
then
jean
he
dropped
me
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
and
went
on
to
see
a
supporter
about
something
lord
j
you
let
him
go
off
like
that
without
lady
john
jean
just
tell
me
my
child
is
it
all
right
jean
my
engagement
yes
absolutely
lady
john
geoffrey
stonor
is
going
to
be
a
little
too
old
for
you
jean
bless
me
am
i
such
a
chicken
lady
john
used
not
to
be
so
young
but
it
become
so
jean
yes
we
do
grow
up
so
quick
but
on
the
other
hand
we
up
longer
lord
j
you
got
what
vulgarly
called
looks
my
dear
and
that
will
help
to
you
up
jean
i
know
what
uncle
john
thinking
but
i
not
the
only
girl
who
been
left
what
vulgarly
called
money
lord
j
you
the
only
one
of
our
immediate
circle
who
been
left
so
beautifully
much
jean
ah
but
remember
geoffrey
could
everybody
he
could
have
married
any
one
in
england
lady
john
i
afraid
everybody
does
know
it
not
excepting
stonor
lord
j
well
how
spoilt
is
the
great
man
jean
not
the
least
little
bit
in
the
world
you
see
he
so
wants
to
know
my
relations
better
an
orphan
has
so
few
belongings
she
has
to
make
the
most
of
them
lord
j
let
us
hope
he
approve
of
us
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
jean
he
will
he
an
angel
why
he
gets
on
with
my
grandfather
lady
john
he
you
mean
to
say
geoffrey
stonor
is
just
a
tiny
bit
superior
about
dissenters
jean
not
half
as
much
as
uncle
john
and
all
the
rest
of
you
my
grandfather
been
ill
again
you
know
and
rather
difficult
bless
him
but
geoffrey
her
lady
john
he
must
have
powers
of
persuasion
to
get
that
old
covenanter
to
let
you
come
in
an
abhorred
on
sunday
too
jean
grandfather
did
know
lady
john

know

honestly
meant
to
come

me
on
my
way

the
station

had
the
most
glorious
run

you
about

affected
oh
very

or

form

restlessness

nice
fella

a
balance

rather
smart

foreign

to
be
haled
out
to
talk
about

shuts
her
handkerchief

and
we
in
the
act
of
discussing
italian
literature
perhaps
you
tell
me
that
is
a
more
savoury
topic
for
a
lady
miss
but
for
the
tramp
population
less
conducive
to
savouriness
do
you
think
than
baths

morbid
interest
in
vagrants

too
leave

of

she
never
goes
anywhere
without
a
mackintosh
and
a
collapsible
bath

too
great

of
thing

pity

more
eloquent
adjectives

laughing
and
talking
to
her
husband
mrs
heriot
jean
for
what
was
freddy
too
happily
married
and
all
the
rest
miss
greatorex
was
repudiating
the
horrid
rumour
that
freddy
had
been
speaking
in
public
about
women
trade
unions
was
that
what
you
said
heriot
lord
j
yes
it
is
made
up
as
carefully
as
your
aunt
parties
usually
are
here
we
got
greatorex
his
who
hates
political
women
and
we
got
in
that
mild
and
little
lady
over
his
shoulder
mrs
freddy
great
down
stage
in
comic
you
do
mean
jean
and
gaily
oh
and
you
got
me
lord
j
genial
my
dear
child
he
does
hate
the
charming
wives
and
sweethearts
who
help
to
win
seats
jean
her
uncle
a
discreet
little
signal
of
miss
greatorex
objects
only
to
the
unsexed
creatures
who
a
lord
j
to
cover
up
his
yes
yes
who
want
to
act
independently
of
men
miss
vote
and
do
silly
things
of
that
sort
lord
j
exactly
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
hear
any
more
of
nonsense
jean
you
mean
that
rowdy
scene
in
the
house
of
commons
yes
no
decent
woman
will
be
able
to
say
suffrage
without
blushing
for
another
generation
thank
heaven
miss
oh
i
understood
that
so
little
i
almost
imagined
people
were
more
stirred
up
about
it
than
they
ever
been
before
great
a
quizzical
affectation
of
not
people
like
you
miss
how
do
you
know
great
a
god
bless
my
soul
lord
j
she
saying
that
only
to
get
a
rise
out
of
you
great
ah
yes
your
frocks
are
serious
enough
miss
i
told
it
an
exploded
notion
that
the
suffrage
women
are
all
dowdy
and
dull
great
do
you
believe
it
miss
well
of
course
we
know
you
been
an
authority
on
the
subject
for
let
see
how
many
years
is
it
you
kept
the
house
in
roars
whenever
woman
rights
are
mentioned
great
but
not
entirely
oh
as
long
as
known
anything
about
politics
there
have
been
a
few
discontented
old
maids
and
hungry
widows
miss
a
few
that
really
rather
forbearing
of
you
greatorex
i
afraid
the
number
of
the
discontented
and
the
hungry
was
among
the
mill
operatives
alone
at
least
the
papers
said
so
did
they
great
oh
do
ask
me
that
kind
of
woman
does
interest
me
afraid
only
i
am
able
to
point
out
to
the
people
who
lose
their
heads
and
seem
inclined
to
treat
the
phenomenon
seriously
that
absolutely
nothing
new
in
it
there
have
been
women
for
the
last
forty
years
who
have
had
anything
more
pressing
to
do
than
petition
parliament
miss
and
that
as
far
as
they
got
lord
j
on
his
it
as
far
as
they
ever
get
the
group
miss
greatorex
let
me
see
was
a
deputation
sent
to
you
not
long
ago
great
h
yes
yes
miss
though
she
has
just
recalled
the
oh
yes
i
remember
i
thought
at
the
time
in
my
modest
way
it
was
nothing
short
of
heroic
of
them
to
go
asking
audience
of
their
arch
opponent
great
it
did
come
off
miss
oh
i
thought
they
insisted
on
bearding
the
lion
in
his
den
great
of
course
i
was
going
to
be
bothered
with
a
lot
of
miss
you
do
mean
you
refused
to
go
out
and
face
them
great
a
comic
look
of
i
would
have
done
it
for
worlds
but
a
friend
of
mine
went
and
had
a
look
at
miss
well
did
he
get
back
alive
great
yes
but
he
advised
me
not
to
go
you
quite
right
he
said
do
you
think
of
bothering
he
said
i
looked
over
the
lot
he
said
and
there
is
a
among
jean
precipitates
herself
into
the
you
remember
freddy
friend
who
came
to
tea
here
in
the
winter
greatorex
he
was
a
member
of
parliament
too
quite
a
little
young
one
he
said
women
would
never
be
respected
till
they
had
the
vote
greatorex
the
other
men
smile
and
all
the
women
mrs
heriot
i
remember
telling
him
that
he
was
too
young
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about
lord

yes

afraid
you
all
sat
on
the
poor
gentleman
lady

her
most
distinguished
air

want
to
be

little
laugh

humanely

reasons

her
to
keep
the
old
man
out

the
workhouse
and
father
is
so
proud
if

would
starve
worst
of
all
he
might
hear
what
had
happened
up
in
london
to
his
girl
she
did
say
i
suppose
how
she
happened
to
fall
so
low

lost
the
train
back
one
sunday
night
and
was

terrified
of
her
employer
to
dare
ring
him
up
after
hours
the
wrong
person
found
her
crying
on
the
platform
she
should
have
gone
to
one
of
the
friendly
societies
miss
at
eleven
at
night
and
there
are
the
rescue
leagues
i
myself
have
been
connected
with
one
for
twenty
years

what
he
gave
me
and
she
began
to
cry
in
her
hand
were
two
pennies
silvered
over
to
look
like
i
do
believe
that
story
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
some
trumps
up
now
who
tells
you
such
miss
several
credible
people
i
did
believe
them
till
jean
till
miss
till
last
week
i
saw
for
myself
lady
john
where
miss
in
a
low
not
a
hundred
yards
from

a
new
organ
for
how

i
was
on
a
pilgrimage
jean
a
pilgrimage
miss
into
the
underworld

jean
how
you
miss
i
put
on
an
old
gown
and
a
tawdry
hat
lady
john
you
never
know
how
many
things
are
hidden
from
a
woman
in
good
clothes
the
bold
free
look
of
a
man
at
a
woman
he
believes
to
be
destitute
you
must
that
look
on
you
before
you
can
understand
a
good
half
of
history
jean
jean
but
where
did
you
go
dressed
like
that
miss
down
among
the
homeless
women
on
a
wet
night
looking
for
shelter
lady
john
no
wonder
you

jean

like
that
miss

miss
it
so
much
worse
i
dare
not
tell
about
it
even
if
you
were
here

could
jean
you
need
suppose
darling
that
those
wretched
creatures
feel
it
as
we
would
miss
the
girls
who
need
shelter
and
work
are
all
an
involuntary
we
know
that
all
the
women
who
are
miss
that
is
why
every
woman
ought
to
take
an
interest
in
this
every
girl
too
jean
yes
oh
yes
lady
john
no
this
is
a
matter
for
us
older
an
air
of
sly
or
for
a
person
who
has
some
special
knowledge
ca
pretend
to
have
access
to
such
sources
of
information
as
miss
levering
miss
heriot
yes
for
i
can
give
you
access
as
you
seem
to
think
i
have
some
knowledge
about
homeless
girls
lady
john
turning
it
well
my
dear
it
will
all
come
in
convenient
the
miss
it
once
happened
to
me
to
take
offence
at
an
ugly
thing
that
was
going
on
under
my
father
roof
oh
ago
i
was
an
impulsive
girl
i
turned
my
back
on
my
father
house
lady
john
jean
that
was
of
course
if
a
girl
does
miss
that
was
what
all
my
relations
said
a
glance
jean
and
i
could
explain
jean
not
to
your
mother
miss
she
was
dead
i
went
to
london
to
a
small
hotel
and
tried
to
find
employment
i
wandered
about
all
day
and
every
day
from
agency
to
agency
i
was
supposed
to
be
educated
i
been
brought
up
partly
in
paris
i
could
play
several
instruments
and
sing
little
songs
in
four
different
tongues
jean
did
nobody
want
you
to
teach
french
or
sing
the
little
songs
miss
the
heads
of
schools
thought
me
too
young
there
were
people
ready
to
listen
to
my
singing
but
the
terms
they
were
too
hard
soon
my
money
was
gone
i
began
to
pawn
my
trinkets
went
jean
and
still
no
work
miss
no
but
by
that
time
i
had
some
real
education
an
unpaid
hotel
bill
and
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
some
girls
think
it
hardship
to
have
to
earn
their
living
the
horror
is
not
to
be
allowed
to
jean
what
happened
lady
john
my
dear
miss
levering
have
your
things
been
sent
down

chance

met
a
friend
of
my
family
jean

was
lucky
miss
i
thought
so
he
was
nearly
ten
years
older
than

he
said
he
wanted
to
help
me
jean
and
did
he
lady
john
her
hand
miss
levering
miss
perhaps
after
all
he
did
sudden
change
of
why
do
i
waste
time
over
myself
i
belonged
to
the
little
class
of
armed
women
my
body
was
born
weak
and
my
spirit
was
broken
by
the
of
slavery
but
as
heriot
was
kind
enough
to
hint
i
do
know
something
about
the
possible
fate
of
homeless
girls
i
found
there
were
pleasant
parks
museums
free
libraries
in
our
great
rich
london
and
not
one
single
place
where
destitute
women
can
be
sure
of
work
that
is
killing
or
food
that
is
worse
than
prison
fare
that
why
women
ought
not
to
sleep
o
nights
till
this
shelter
stands
spreading
out
wide
arms
jean
no
no
up
her
gloves
fan
even
when
it
built
you
see
many
of
those
creatures
will
prefer
the
life
they
lead
they
it
miss
a
woman
told
me
one
of
the
sort
that
knows
told
me
many
of
them
like
it
so
much
that
they
are
indifferent
to
the
risk
of
being
sent
to
prison
gives
them
a
she
said
lady
john
a
rest
miss
levering
at
the
clock
as
she
rises
to
go
lady
john
heriot
their
heads
over
the
plan
covertly
jean
miss
levering
i
want
to
begin
to
understand
something
of
i
horribly
ignorant
miss
at
her
i
a
rather
busy
person
jean
i
have
a
quite
special
reason
for
wanting
to
be
ignorant
i
go
to
town
if
come
and
lunch
with
me
miss
thank
you
i
heriot
i
must
go
and
put
my
hat
on
how
little
she
minds
all
these
horrors
lady
john
they
turn
me
cold
ugh
i
wonder
if
she
signed
the
visitors
book
for
all
her
shelter
schemes
she
a
hard
woman
jean
miss
levering
is
oh
of
course
wo
think
so
she
has
angled
very
adroitly
for
your
sympathy
jean
she
does
look
hard
lady
john
jean
taking
i
not
sure
but
what
she
does
her
mouth
always
like
this
as
if
she
were
holding
back
something
by
main
force
under
her
well
so
she
is
lady
john
the
lobby
to
look
at
the
visitors
jean
why
have
i
seen
her
before
oh
she
lived
abroad
with
you
know
about
her
i
suppose
jean
i
do
know
how
aunt
ellen
came
to
know
her
that
was
my
doing
but
i
did
bargain
for
her
being
introduced
to
you
jean
she
seems
to
go
everywhere
and
why
should
she
you
must
ask
her
to
eaton
square
jean
i
have
then
you
have
to
get
out
of
it
jean
a
stubborn
i
must
have
a
reason
and
a
very
good
reason
well
it
not
a
thing
i
should
have
preferred
to
tell
you
but
i
know
how
difficult
you
are
to
guide
so
i
suppose
you
have
to
know
her
it
was
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
i
found
her
horribly
ill
in
a
lonely
welsh
farmhouse
we
had
taken
the
manor
for
that
august
the
farmer
wife
was
frightened
and
begged
me
to
go
and
see
what
i
thought
i
soon
saw
how
it
was
i
thought
she
was
dying
jean
what
was
the
i
got
no
more
out
of
her
than
the
farmer
wife
did
she
had
had
no
letters
there
had
been
no
one
to
see
her
except
a
man
down
from
london
a
doctor
nameless
of
course
and
then
this
result
the
farmer
and
his
wife
highly
respectable
people
were
incensed
they
were
for
turning
the
girl
out
jean
but
yes
pitiless
some
of
these
people
are
i
insisted
they
should
treat
the
girl
humanely
and
we
became
friends
that
is
sort
of
in
spite
of
all
i
did
for
her
jean
what
did
you
do
i
i
told
you
and
i
lent
her
money
no
small
sum
either
jean
has
she
never
paid
it
back
oh
yes
after
a
time
but
i
kept
her
secret
as
much
as
i
knew
of
it
jean
but
you
been
telling
me
that
was
my
duty
and
i
had
her
full
confidence
jean
was
it
natural
she
well
all
things
considered
she
might
have
wanted
to
tell
me
who
was
responsible
jean
oh
aunt
lydia
all
she
ever
said
was
that
she
was
ashamed
her
temper
and
her
fine
feeling
for
the
innocence
of
her
ashamed
that
she
had
had
the
courage
to
resist
not
the
original
temptation
but
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
her
not
to
go
through
with
it
as
she
said
jean
her
you
are
being
so
delicate
i
not
sure
i
understand
the
only
thing
you
need
understand
is
that
not
a
desirable
companion
for
a
young
girl
jean
when
did
you
see
her
after
after
a
slight
i
met
her
last
winter
at
the
bishop
she
a
connection
of
his
wife
they
got
her
to
help
with
some
of
their
work
then
she
took
hold
of
ours
your
aunt
and
uncle
are
quite
foolish
about
her
and
i
debarred
from
taking
any
steps
at
least
till
the
shelter
is
out
of
hand
jean
i
do
rather
wonder
she
can
bring
herself
to
talk
about
the
unfortunate
women
of
the
world
the
effrontery
of
it
jean
or
the
courage
her
hand
up
to
her
throat
as
if
the
sentence
had
caught
even
presumes
to
set
right
of
course
i
do
in
the
least
poor
soul
but
i
feel
i
owe
it
to
your
dead
mother
to
tell
you
about
her
especially
as
you
old
enough
now
to
know
something
about
life
jean
and
since
a
girl
need
be
very
old
to
suffer
for
her
ignorance
a
little
i
she
was
rather
wonderful
jean
to
have
lived
through
when
she
was
how
old
oh
nineteen
or
thereabouts
jean
five
years
younger
than
i
to
be
abandoned
and
to
come
out
of
it
like
this
her
hand
on
the
girl
it
was
too
bad
to
have
to
tell
you
such
a
sordid
story
of
all
days
jean
it
is
a
very
terrible
story
but
this
was
a
bad
time
i
feel
very
sorry
for
women
who
are
happy
horn
heard
that
geoffrey
stonor
what
makes
you
think
jean
yes
yes

humanly
possible

i
was
afraid
to

fear

prevented

felt

heavy

jove
to
the
others
clustered
round
the
what
gigantic
luck
outside

and
glance
and
then
elaborately
turn
their
backs
and
pretend
to
be
talking
among
themselves
but
betray
as
far
as
manners
permit
the
enormous
sensation
the
arrival

half
way
they
shake
hands
smiling
into
each
other
jean
such
a
long
time
since
we
met
lord

stonor
you
growing
very
enterprising
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
when
i
heard
you
motored
all
the
way
from
town
to
see
a
supporter
on
sunday
stonor
i
do
know
how
we
covered
the
ground
in
the
old
days
lady
john
it
no
use
to
stand
for
your
borough
any
more
the
american
you
know
he
runs
for
congress
by
and
by
we
shall
all
be
flying
after
the
thing
we
want
jean
jean
sh
and
then
glances
over
her
shoulder
and
speaks
all
sorts
of
irrelevant
people
here
farn
to
resist
the
temptation
comes
how
do
you
do
stonor
stonor
oh
how
do
farn
some
of
them
were
arguing
in
the
last
night
whether
it
did
hurt
a
man
chances
going
about
in
a
motor
lord
j
yes
we
been
hearing
a
lot
of
stories
about
the
unpopularity
of
among
the
class
that
has
got
of
course
what
do
you
say
lady
john
i
sure
you
gain
more
votes
by
being
able
to
reach
so
many
more
of
your
constituency
than
we
used
stonor
well
i
do
know
i
sometimes
wondered
whether
the
charm
of
our
presence
was
counterbalanced
by
the
way
we
tear
about
smothering
our
in
dust
and
running
down
their
pigs
and
chickens
not
to
speak
of
their
children
lord
j
what
on
the
whole
are
the
prospects
farnborough
stonor
we
shall
have
to
work
harder
than
we
realised
farn
ah
towards
jean
a
as
she
slips
her
arm
in
her
uncle
and
smiles
geoffrey
he
says
he
believes
i
be
able
to
make
a
real
difference
to
his
chances
is
it
angelic
of
him
stonor
a
jocular
angelic
macchiavelian
i
pin
all
my
hopes
on
your
being
able
to
counteract
the
pernicious
influence
of
my
opponent
glib
wife
jean
you
want
me
to
have
a
share
in
it
all
do
you
geoffrey
stonor
into
her
of
course
i
do
farnborough
down
again
on
pretence
of
talking
mrs
heriot
lord
i
do
gather
you
altogether
sanguine
any
complication
jean
lady
john
close
girl
radiant
stonor
her
eyes
and
whispering
to
the
sympathetic
elder
stonor
well
sunday
paper
out
of
there
this
agitation
about
the
woman
question
oddly
enough
it
seems
likely
to
affect
the
issue
lord
j
why
should
it
ca
you
do
what
the
other
four
hundred
have
done
stonor
easily
but
you
see
the
mere
fact
that
four
hundred
and
twenty
members
have
been
worried
into
promising
support
and
then
once
in
the
house
have
let
the
matter
severely
alone
lord
j
stonor
let
it
alone
bless
my
soul
i
should
think
so
indeed
stonor
of
course
only
it
a
device
that
somewhat
worn
miss
levering
hat
on
gloves
and
veil
in
her
lord
j
still
if
they
think
they
getting
a
future
cabinet
minister
on
their
side
stonor
it
will
be
sufficiently
embarrassing
for
the
cabinet
minister
stonor
to
speak
jean
dead
miss
levering
jean
you
know
one
another
miss
stonor
intentness
but
quite
everybody
in
this
part
of
the
world
knows
stonor
but
he
know
me
lord
j
miss
levering
greatorex
in
with
an
air
of
freddy
wide
jean
miss
levering
artless
oh
have
you
been
hearing
him
speak
miss
yes
i
was
visiting
some
relations
near
dutfield
they
took
me
to
hear
you
stonor
oh
the
night
the
suffragettes
made
their
customary
row
miss
the
night
they
asked
you
stonor
at
the
first
chance
of
distraction
shakes
hands
freddy
well
freddy
what
do
you
think
of
your
friends
now
my
friends
stonor
her
the
sunday
yes
the
disorderly
women
they
are
not
my
friends
but
i
do
think
you
must
call
them
stonor
why
not
i
can
forgive
them
for
worrying
the
late
government
but
they
disorderly
miss
is
the
phrase
consecrated
to
a
different
class
great
has
got
hold
of
the
sunday
he
perfectly
right
how
do
you
do
disorderly
women
that
what
they
are
farn
over
his
ought
to
be
locked
up
every
one
of
great
public
nuisances
going
about
with
dog
whips
and
spitting
in
policemen
faces
a
harassed
i
wonder
if
they
did
spit
great
of
they
did
on
you
no
authority
on
what
they
do
run
away
great
to
turn
the
run
away
yes
a
few
and
if
ever
i
muster
up
courage
to
come
back
it
will
be
to
vote
for
better
manners
in
public
life
not
worse
than
we
have
already
so
should
i
do
think
that
defend
the
suffragette
methods
jean
cheerful
still
you
an
advocate
of
the
suffrage
are
you
i
do
beat
the
air
great
only
policemen
if
you
cared
to
know
the
attitude
of
the
real
workers
in
the
reform
you
might
have
noticed
in
any
paper
last
week
we
lost
no
time
in
dissociating
ourselves
from
the
little
group
of
hysterical
her
husband
eye
and
instantly
checks
her
flow
of
they
have
lowered
the
whole
sex
in
the
eyes
of
the
entire
world
jean
geoffrey
stonor
i
ca
quite
see
what
they
want
those
suffragettes
great
notoriety
farn
what
they
want
a
good
thrashin
that
what
i
give
miss
spirited
fellow
lord
j
well
there
one
sure
thing
they
dished
their
goose
greatorex
still
reading
the
i
believe
these
silly
scenes
are
a
pure
joy
to
you
great
final
to
the
whole
silly
business
jean
looking
from
one
to
the
the
suffragettes
do
seem
to
they
dead
great
they
still
keep
up
a
sort
of
but
they
done
for
themselves
jean
her
hands
with
oh
i
hope
they
last
till
the
election
over
farn
why
jean
oh
we
want
them
to
get
the
working
man
to
and
a
little
to
vote
for
the
conservative
candidate
that
so
round
for
help
general
lord
j
fancy
jean
great
the
working
man
a
good
deal
of
an
ass
but
even
he
listen
to
jean
appealing
to
the
stonor
but
he
listen
like
anything
i
asked
why
there
were
so
few
at
the
long
mitcham
meeting
and
i
was
told
oh
they
all
gone
to
hear
miss
stonor
just
for
a
lark
that
was
lord
j
it
has
no
real
effect
on
the
vote
great
not
the
smallest
jean
stonor
why
i
thought
you
said
stonor
rubbing
his
hand
over
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
speaking
i
a
notion
a
little
soap
and
water
would
do
me
any
harm
lord
i
take
you
up
you
know
freddy
tunbridge
stonor
to
shake
hands
exeunt
all
jean
stonor
away
says
greatorex
well
if
women
are
of
no
importance
in
politics
it
is
for
the
reason
you
gave
there
is
now
and
then
a
among
them
great
about
hm
hm
himself
mrs
freddy
lord
the
perils
that
beset
the
feet
of
man
an
air
of
comic
caution
moves
jean
farnborough
why
does
he
behave
like
that
farn
his
moral
sense
is
shocked
jean
why
i
saw
him
and
freddy
together
at
the
french
play
the
other
night
as
thick
as
thieves
miss
ah
that
was
before
he
knew
her
revolting
views
jean
what
revolting
views
great
sh
sunday
greatorex
cautiously
further
jean
in
spite
of
i
ca
believe
women
are
so
helpless
when
i
see
men
so
afraid
of
them
great
the
great
mistake
was
in
teaching
them
to
read
and
write
jean
miss
levering
something
miss
greatorex
oh
no
that
was
the
worst
mistake
great
yes
it
was
miss
no
believe
me
the
mistake
was
in
letting
women
learn
to
talk
great
about
with
sudden
i
see
now
what
to
be
the
next
great
reform
miss
up
the
little
when
women
are
all
dumb
no
more
discussions
of
the
paradiso
great
a
gesture
of
mock
the
thing
itself
that
a
great
deal
better
than
talking
about
it
as
i
sure
know
miss
why
do
you
think
i
know
great
only
the
plain
women
are
in
any
doubt
jean
miss
levering
great
wait
for
me
farnborough
i
can
not
go
about
unprotected
farnborough
greatorex
it
true
what
that
old
cynic
says
the
scene
in
the
house
has
put
back
the
reform
a
generation
jean
i
wish
been
there
i
jean
oh
was
it
like
the
papers
said
worse
i
never
been
so
moved
in
public
no
tragedy
no
great
opera
ever
gripped
an
audience
as
the
situation
in
the
house
did
that
night
there
we
all
sat
breathless
with
everything
more
favourable
to
us
than
it
had
been
within
the
memory
of
women
another
five
minutes
and
the
resolution
would
have
passed
then
all
in
a
moment
lady
john
heriot
listen
they
talking
about
the
female
hooligans
no
thank
you
apart
with
the
church
times
all
in
a
moment
a
horrible
dingy
little
flag
was
poked
through
the
grille
of
the
gallery
cries
insults
scuffling
the
police
the
ignominious
turning
out
of
the
women
as
well
as
the
oh
i
ca
of
it
without
up
and
walks
to
and
then
the
next
morning
the
people
gloating
our
friends
antagonised
people
who
were
wavering
nearly
won
over
all
thrown
back
heart
breaking
even
my
husband
freddy
been
an
angel
about
letting
me
take
my
share
when
i
felt
i
must
but
of
course
i
always
known
he
does
really
like
it
it
makes
him
shy
i
sure
it
gives
him
a
horrid
twist
inside
when
he
sees
my
name
among
the
speakers
on
the
placards
but
he
always
been
an
angel
about
it
before
this
after
the
disgraceful
scene
he
said
it
just
shows
how
unfit
women
are
for
any
sort
of
coherent
thinking
or
concerted
action
jean
to
think
that
it
should
be
women
who
given
the
cause
the
worst
blow
it
ever
had
the
work
of
forty
years
destroyed
in
five
minutes
jean
they
must
have
felt
pretty
sick
when
they
woke
up
the
next
morning
the
suffragettes
i
do
waste
any
sympathy
on
i
thinking
of
the
penalty
women
have
to
pay
because
a
handful
of
hysterical
jean
still
i
think
i
sorry
for
them
it
must
be
dreadful
to
find
you
done
such
a
lot
of
harm
to
the
thing
you
care
most
about
in
the
world
miss
do
you
picture
the
suffragettes
sitting
in
sackcloth
well
they
ca
help
realising
what
they
done
miss
is
it
just
possible
they
realise
they
waked
up
interest
in
the
woman
question
so
that
it
advertised
in
every
paper
and
discussed
in
every
house
from
land
end
to
john
do
you
think
know
there
been
more
said
and
written
about
it
in
these
ten
days
since
the
scene
than
in
the
ten
years
before
it
you
are
saying
you
think
it
was
a
good
way
to
get
what
they
wanted
miss
i
only
pointing
out
that
it
seems
not
such
a
bad
way
to
get
it
known
they
want
something
and
want
it
bad
jean
did
greatorex
say
women
had
been
politely
petitioning
parliament
for
forty
years
miss
and
men
have
only
laughed
jean
but
they
come
round
looks
from
one
to
the
tunbridge
says
before
that
horrid
scene
everything
was
favourable
at
last
miss
at
last
had
it
been
just
as
favourable
before
no
we
never
had
so
many
members
pledged
to
our
side
miss
i
thought
i
heard
somebody
say
the
bill
had
got
as
far
as
that
time
and
time
again
jean
oh
no
surely
not
this
was
only
a
resolution
the
bill
passed
a
second
reading
years
ago
jean
wide
and
what
difference
did
it
make
miss
the
men
laughed
rather
louder
oh
it
got
as
far
as
a
second
reading
several
times
but
we
never
had
so
many
friends
in
the
house
before
miss
a
faint
friends
jean
why
do
you
say
it
like
that
miss
perhaps
because
i
was
thinking
of
a
funny
story
he
said
it
was
funny
a
liberal
whip
told
me
the
other
day
a
radical
member
went
out
of
the
house
after
his
speech
in
favour
of
the
woman
bill
and
as
he
came
back
half
an
hour
later
he
heard
some
members
talking
in
the
lobby
about
the
astonishing
number
who
were
going
to
vote
for
the
measure
and
the
friend
of
woman
dropped
his
jaw
and
clutched
the
man
next
him
my
god
he
said
you
do
mean
to
say
they
going
to
give
it
to
them
jean
oh
you
do
think
all
men
in
parliament
are
like
that
miss
i
do
think
all
men
are
burglars
but
i
lock
my
doors
jean
her
you
think
that
night
of
the
scene
you
think
the
men
did
to
play
fair
miss
coolness
in
contrast
to
the
excitement
of
the
did
the
women
sit
quiet
till
ten
minutes
to
closing
time
jean
ten
minutes
to
settle
a
question
like
that
miss
freddy
could
you
see
the
men
were
at
their
old
game
lady
john
you
think
they
were
just
putting
off
the
issue
till
it
was
too
late
miss
a
detached
was
there
but
i
have
heard
anybody
deny
that
the
women
waited
till
ten
minutes
to
eleven
then
they
discovered
the
policeman
who
been
sent
up
at
the
psychological
moment
to
the
back
of
the
gallery
then
i
told
when
the
women
saw
they
were
betrayed
once
more
they
utilised
the
few
minutes
left
to
impress
on
the
country
at
large
the
fact
of
their
demands
did
it
in
the
only
way
left
them
leaning
forward
reflectively
smiling
chin
in
it
does
rather
look
to
the
outsider
as
if
the
women
had
worked
for
forty
years
and
made
less
impression
on
the
world
then
those
fiery
young
women
made
in
five
minutes
oh
come
be
fair
miss
well
you
must
admit
that
next
day
every
newspaper
reader
in
europe
and
america
knew
there
were
women
in
england
in
such
dead
earnest
about
the
suffrage
that
the
men
had
stopped
laughing
at
last
and
turned
them
out
of
the
house
men
even
advertised
how
little
they
appreciated
the
fun
by
sending
the
women
to
gaol
in
pretty
sober
earnest
and
all
the
world
was
talking
about
it
heriot
down
the
church
times
and
joins
the
lady
john
i
have
noticed
whenever
the
men
are
there
the
women
sit
and
discuss
that
scene
jean
sha
have
to
wait
till
the
men
are
gone
lady
john
and
says
half
he
in
sympathy
lady
john
how
do
you
know
jean
he
told
the
interrupting
women
so
freddy
mystified
the
others
lady
john
oh
freddy
lord
john
by
the
door
they
went
out
of
they
stop
to
here
freddy
hastily
miss
levering
judging
from
the
outside
those
of
us
who
have
been
working
for
years
we
all
realise
it
was
a
perfectly
lunatic
proceeding
why
the
only
chance
of
our
getting
what
we
want
is
by
the
men
watchful
eye
leaving
her
husband
for
a
moment
miss
levering
involuntary
what
the
matter
miss
winning
over
the
men
has
been
the
woman
way
for
centuries

you
think
the
result
should
make
us
proud
of
our
policy

those

that
way
forward
with
clasped
hands
looking
into
every
woman
in
a
state
of
natural
subjection
jean

allegiance

her
idea
of
romance
and
her
hope
of
motherhood
they
embodied
for
her

they
the
strongest
things
in

till

them

want
to
go

wretches
who

homeless
on

of

four

aged

with

wondering

apologetically

up

then
saunter
off

by
a
small
dirty
boy
of

need
be
seen
bearing
the
final
words
of

will
be

to
get
to

group
of
speakers
on

these
are
as
the
curtain

is
waving
her

d
think
many
o
you
workin
men
would
be
found
turnin
over
their
wyges
to
their
wives
no
wot
the
reason
thousands
do
and
the
best
and
the
soberest
because
the
workin
man
knows
that
wot
a
pound
to
is
twenty
shillin
to
wife
and
she
myke
every
penny
in
every
one
o
them
shillin
she
gets
more
fur

let
the
women
manage
well
the
poor

the

because
the

do
the
national

a
libel
to

about

yorkshire
tailoresses

o
the
poor

i
can
tell
you
we
see
there
reforms

if
you
us
you
be
yerselves
voices
rot
drivel
old
newsvendor
true
as
gospel
retires
against
the
banner
with
the
others
there
is
some
a
man
well
now
that
wus
so
bad
fur
a
woman
another
fur
a
chairman
through
this
miss
ernestine
blunt
will
now
address
you
chiefly
ironic
laughter
a
general
moving
closer
and
knitting
up
of
ernestine
blunt
about
but
looks
younger
she
is
very
downright
not
to
say
pugnacious
the
something
amusing
and
attractive
about
her
is
there
as
it
were
against
her
will
and
the
more
fetching
for
that
she
has
no
conventional
gestures
and
none
of
any
sort
at
first
as
she
warms
to
her
work
she
uses
her
slim
hands
to
enforce
her
emphasis
but
as
though
unconsciously
her
manner
of
speech
is
less
monotonous
than
that
of
the
average
but
she
too
has
a
fashion
of
leaning
all
her
weight
on
the
end
of
the
sentence
she
brings
out
the
final
word
or
two
with
an
effort
of
underscoring
and
makes
a
forward
motion
of
the
slim
body
as
if
the
better
to
drive
the
last
nail
in
she
evidently
means
to
be
immensely
practical
the
kind
who
is
pleased
to
think
she
has
a
grain
of
sentimentality
in
her
composition
and
whose
feeling
when
it
does
all
but
master
her
communicates
itself
magnetically
to
miss
ernestine
blunt
perhaps
i
better
begin
by
explaining
a
little
about
our
tactics
tactics
we
know
mykin
trouble
public
scandal
to
make
you
understand
what
we
done
i
must
remind
you
of
what
others
have
done
perhaps
you
do
know
that
women
first
petitioned
parliament
for
the
franchise
as
long
ago
as
voice
how
do
know
pauses
a
moment
taken
off
her
guard
by
the
suddenness
of
the
voice
you
was
there
voice
that
was
the
trouble
haw
haw
miss
b
and
the
petition
was
presented
voice
give
a
now
she
got
out
of
crydle
miss
e
presented
to
the
house
of
commons
by
that
great
liberal
john
stuart
mill
mill
who
is
he
when
he
at
home
bills
or
resolutions
have
been
before
the
house
on
and
off
for
the
last
years
that
roughly
is
our
history
we
found
ourselves
towards
the
close
of
the
year
with
no
assurance
that
if
we
went
on
in
the
same
way
any
girl
born
into
the
world
in
this
generation
would
live
to
exercise
the
rights
of
citizenship
though
she
lived
to
be
a
hundred
so
we
said
all
this
has
been
in
vain
we
must
try
some
other
way
how
did
the
working
man
get
the
suffrage
we
asked
ourselves
well
we
turned
up
the
records
and
we
voices
not
by
scratching
people
faces
disraeli
give
it
dizzy
get
out
cahnty
cahncil
scholarships
oh
lord
this
education
chartist
riots
she
thinkin
of
in
the
miss
b
but
we
do
to
follow
such
a
violent
example
we
would
much
rather
but
if
that
the
only
way
we
can
make
the
country
see
we
in
earnest
we
are
prepared
to
show
them
voice
an
they
show
you
give
you
another
month
miss
b
do
think
that
going
to
prison
has
any
fears
for
us
go
if
by
doing
that
we
could
get
freedom
for
the
rest
of
the
women
voices
hear
hear
rot
do
the
men
ye
to
get
your
rights
miss
b
here
some
one
asking
why
the
men
do
help
it
partly
they
do
understand
yet
they
before
we
done
partly
they
do
understand
yet
what
at
stake
respectable
old
man
lord
they
a
of
us
voice
wot
next
miss
e
and
partly
that
the
bravest
man
is
afraid
of
ridicule
oh
yes
we
heard
a
great
deal
all
our
lives
about
the
timidity
and
the
sensitiveness
of
women
and
it
true
we
sensitive
but
i
tell
you
ridicule
crumples
a
man
up
it
steels
a
woman
we
come
to
know
the
value
of
ridicule
we
educated
ourselves
so
that
we
welcome
ridicule
we
owe
our
sincerest
thanks
to
the
comic
writers
the
cartoonist
is
our
unconscious
friend
who
cartoons
people
who
are
of
no
importance
what
advertisement
is
so
sure
of
being
remembered
poetic
young
man
i
admit
that
miss
b
if
we
did
know
it
by
any
other
sign
the
comic
papers
would
tell
us
but
our
greatest
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
the
man
who
called
us
female
hooligans
crowd
bursts
into
we
are
hooligans
but
we
hope
the
fact
will
be
overlooked
if
everybody
said
we
were
nice
women
who
come
to
hear
us
the
men
tell
us
it
is
womanly
for
us
to
care
about
politics
how
do
they
know
what
womanly
it
for
women
to
decide
that
let
the
men
attend
to
being
manly
it
will
take
them
all
their
time
voice
are
we
oh
no
miss
b
and
they
say
it
would
be
dreadful
if
we
got
the
vote
because
then
we
be
pitted
against
men
in
the
economic
struggle
but
that
come
about
already
do
you
know
that
out
of
every
hundred
women
in
this
country
are
women
it
used
to
be
thought
unfeminine
for
women
to
be
students
and
to
aspire
to
the
arts
that
bring
fame
and
fortune
but
nobody
has
ever
said
it
was
unfeminine
for
women
to
do
the
heavy
drudgery
that
badly
paid
that
kind
of
work
had
to
be
done
by
and
the
men
did
hanker
after
it
oh
no
and
a
man
on
the
outer
fringe
she
can
the
little
one
can
another
oh
they
can
all
talk
a
beery
dirty
fellow
of
fifty
i
would
like
to
be
think
o
comin
to
his
pal
i
soon
learn
miss
b
through
the
oh
no
the
women
scrub
and
cook
and
that
all
right
but
if
they
want
to
try
their
hand
at
the
better
paid
work
of
the
liberal
professions
oh
very
unfeminine
indeed
then
there
another
thing
now
i
want
you
to
listen
to
this
because
it
important
men
say
if
we
persist
in
competing
with
them
for
the
bigger
prizes
they
dreadfully
afraid
we
lose
the
beautiful
protecting
chivalry
that
yes
i
wonder
you
laugh
laugh
forward
with
lit
but
the
women
i
found
at
the
ferry
tin
works
working
for
five
shillings
a
week
i
did
see
them
laughing
the
beautiful
chivalry
of
the
employers
of
women
does
prevent
them
from
paying
women
tenpence
a
day
for
sorting
coal
and
loading
and
unloading
carts
does
prevent
them
from
forcing
women
to
earn
bread
in
ways
worse
still
so
we
talk
about
chivalry
it
being
we
just
let
this
poor
ghost
of
chivalry
go
in
exchange
for
a
little
plain
justice
voice
if
the
house
of
commons
wo
give
you
justice
why
do
you
go
to
the
house
of
lords
miss
b
what
voice
better
up
case
of
early
closin
a
man
at
the
back
asks
the
speaker
miss
b
to
you
be
allowed
to
ask
any
question
you
like
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
of
oh
is
it
question
time
i
miss
killed
cock
robin
is
about
to
resume
but
above
the
general
noise
the
voice
of
a
man
at
the
back
reaches
her
indistinct
but
insistent
she
leans
forward
trying
to
catch
what
he
says
while
the
indistinguishable
murmur
has
been
going
geoffrey

appeared
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd

hope
we
hear
one
of
the
the
worst
miss

the
interrupter
on
the
other
what
what
do
you
say
screws
up
her
eyes
with
the
effort
to
hear
and
puts
a
hand
up
to
her
ear
a
few
indistinguishable
words
between
her
and
the
lady
john
has
been
studying
the
figures
on
the
platform
through
her
lorgnon
turns
to
a
working

you
tell
me
my

are
the
ones
that
a
that

nice
little
working

how
about

b
well
you
know
some
people
say
the
whole
trouble
about
us
is
that
we
fight
but
it
is
only
hard
necessity
makes
us
do
that
we
do
to
fight
as
men
seem
to
just
for
fighting
sake
women
are
for
peace
voice
hear
hear
miss
b
and
when
we
have
a
share
in
public
affairs
there
be
less
likelihood
of
war
but
that
not
to
say
women
ca
fight
the
boer
women
did
the
russian
women
face
conflicts
worse
than
any
battlefield
can
show
voice
shakes
a
little
and
the
eyes
fill
but
she
controls
her
emotion
gallantly
and
dashes
but
we
women
know
all
that
is
evil
and
we
for
peace
our
part
we
proud
to
remember
it
our
part
has
been
to
go
about
after
you
men
in
and
up
the
great
yes
seems
funny
does
it
you
men
blow
them
to
bits
and
then
we
come
along
and
put
them
together
again
if
you
know
anything
about
military
nursing
you
know
a
good
deal
of
our
work

been
done
in
the
face
of
danger
it
always
been
old
newsvendor
that
so
that
so
miss

taking
away
from
you
men
the
work
that
always
been
yours
you
ca
any
longer
keep
women
out
of
the
industries
the
only
question
is
upon
what
terms

she
continue
to
be
in
as
long
as
she
in
on
bad
terms
she
not
only
hurting
herself
she
hurting
you
but
if
you

discouraged
about
our

trade
in

the
men

visible
effort
she
goes
well
i
certainly
did
know
before
that
the
sergeants
and
policemen
are
instructed
to
deceive
the
people
as
to
the
time
such
cases
are
heard
you
ask
and
you
sent
to
marlborough
police
court
instead
of
to
marylebone
voice
they
ought
ter
sent
yer
to
do
y
good
old
newsvendor
you
go
on
miss
do
mind
voice
wot
expect
from
a
pig
but
a
grunt
miss
you
told
the
case
will
be
at
two
and
it
really
called
for
eleven
well
i
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
i
believe
what
i
was
told
a
little
to
her
yes
that
almost
the
first
thing
we
have
to
learn
to
get
over
our
touching
faith
that
because
a
man
tells
us
something
it
true
i
got
to
the
right
court
and
i
was
so
anxious
not
to
be
late
i
was
too
early
the
case
before
the
women
was
just
coming
on
i
heard
a
noise
at
the
door
i
saw
the
helmets
of
two
policemen
and
i
said
to
myself
what
sort
of
crime
shall
i
have
to
sit
and
hear
about
is
this
a
burglar
coming
along
between
the
two
big
policemen
or
will
it
be
a
murderer
what
sort
of
felon
is
to
stand
in
the
dock
before
the
women
whose
crime
is
they
ask
for
the
vote
but
try
as
i
would
i
see
the
prisoner
my
heart
misgave
me
is
it
a
woman
i
wondered
then
the
policemen
got
nearer
and
i
saw
waits
an
a
little
thin
boy
what
do
you
think
he
was
charged
with
stealing
what
had
he
been
stealing
that
small
criminal
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
sat
there
looking
on
that
the
men
who
had
the
affairs
of
the
world
in
their
hands
from
the
beginning
and
who
made
so
poor
a
business
of
it
voices
oh
oh
pore
benighted
man
are
we
no
miss
so
poor
a
business
of
it
as
to
have
the
poor
and
the
unemployed
in
the
condition
they
in
when
your
only
remedy
for
a
starving
child
is
to
hale
him
off
to
the
because
he
had
managed
to
get
a
little
milk
well
i
wonder
that
the
men
refuse
to
be
helped
with
a
problem
they
so
notoriously
failed
at
i
began
to
say
to
myself
is
it
time
the
women
lent
a
hand
a
voice
would
you
have
women
magistrates
is
stumped
by
the
suddenness
of
the
voices
haw
haw
magistrates
another
women
let
prove
first
they
deserve
a
shabby
art
student
hair
longish
soft
hat
and
flowing
they
study
music
by
thousands
where
their
beethoven
where
their
plato
where
the
woman
shakespeare
another
yes
what
they
ever
speaker
clenches
her
hands
and
is
recovering
her
presence
of
mind
so
that
by
the
time
chairman
make
himself
heard
with
now
men
give
this
lady
a
fair
hearing
interrupt
she
with
the
slightest
of
gestures
waves
him
aside
with
a
low
it
all
right
miss
and
raising
her
these
questions
are
quite
proper
they
are
often
asked
elsewhere
and
i
would
like
to
ask
in
return
since
when
was
human
society
held
to
exist
for
its
handful
of
geniuses
how
many
platos
are
there
here
in
this
crowd
a
voice
loud
and
divil
a
wan
miss
not
one
yet
that
does
keep
you
men
off
the
register
how
many
shakespeares
are
there
in
all
england
not
one
yet
the
state
does
tumble
to
pieces
railroads
and
ships
are
built
homes
are
kept
going
and
babies
are
born
the
world
goes
on
over
the
it
goes
on
virtue
of
its
common
voices
hear
hear
miss
i
am
not
concerned
that
you
should
think
we
women
can
paint
great
pictures
or
compose
immortal
music
or
write
good
books
i
am
content
that
we
should
be
classed
with
the
common
people
who
keep
the
world
going
but
up
and
taking
a
fresh
i
like
the
world
to
go
a
great
deal
better
we
were
talking
about
justice
i
have
been
inquiring
into
the
kind
of
lodging
the
poorest
class
of
homeless
women
can
get
in
this
town
of
london
i
find
that
only
the
men
of
that
class
are
provided
for
some
measure
to
establish
rowton
houses
for
women
has
been
before
the
london
county
council
they
looked
into
the
question
very
carefully
so
their
apologists
say
and
what
did
they
decide
they
decided
that
could
do
lady
john
forced
her
way
stonor
is
that
true
stonor
miss
levering
i
do
know
miss
why
could
that
great
body
do
nothing
because
if
these
cheap
and
decent
houses
were
opened
they
said
the
homeless
women
in
the
streets
would
make
use
of
them
you
think
i
not
in
earnest
but
that
was
actually
the
decision
and
the
reason
given
for
it
women
that
the
bitter
struggle
for
existence
has
forced
into
a
life
of
horror
stonor
lady
john
you
think
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
motion
of
the
head
jean
miss
the
outcast
women
might
take
advantage
of
the
shelter
these
decent
cheap
places
offered
but
the
i
said
are
all
who
avail
themselves
of
lord

are

to
depend
on
the
chivalry
of
men
two
policemen
who
at
first
had
been
strolling
about

stood
during
this
scene
in

falls
upon
his
big
figure
he
still
has
the
collar
of
his
motor
coat
turned
up
to
his
ears
a
change
passes
over
her
face
and
her
nerve
fails
her
an
miss
justice
and
chivalry
steadies
her
voice
and
hurries
they
both
remind
me
of
what
those
of
you
who
read
the
news
i
have
begun
only
lately
to
do
that
but
seen
the
accounts
of
the
girl
who
been
tried
in
manchester
lately
for
the
murder
of
her
child
not
pleasant
reading
even
if
we
noticed
it
we
would
speak
of
it
in
my
world
a
few
months
ago
i
should
have
turned
away
my
eyes
and
forgotten
even
the
headline
as
quickly
as
i
could
but
since
that
morning
in
the
i
read
these
things
this
as
you
remember
was
about
a
little
working
girl
an
orphan
of
eighteen
who
crawled
with
the
dead
body
of
her
child
to
her
master
and
left
the
baby
there
she
dragged
herself
a
little
way
off
and
fainted
a
few
days
later
she
found
herself
in
court
being
tried
for
the
murder
of
her
child
her
master
a
married
man
had
of
course
reported
the
find
at
his
to
the
police
and
he
had
been
summoned
to
give
evidence
the
girl
cried
out
to
him
in
the
open
court
you
are
the
father
he
could
deny
it
the
coroner
at
the
jury
request
censured
the
man
and
regretted
that
the
law
did
make
him
responsible
but
he
went
and
that
girl
is
now
serving
her
sentence
in
strangeways
gaol
and
scraps
of
indistinguishable
comment
in
the
crowd
through
which
jean
is
jean
has
wormed
her
way
stonor
why
do
you
dislike
her
so
stonor
i
why
should
you
think
jean
a
vaguely
frightened
i
never
saw
you
look
as
you
did
as
you
do
chairman
order
please
give
the
lady
a
fair
miss
to
him
it
all
right
men
make
boast
that
an
english
citizen
is
tried
by
his
peers
what
woman
is
tried
by
hers
sombre
passion
strengthens
her
voice
and
hurries
her
a
woman
is
arrested
by
a
man
brought
before
a
man
judge
tried
by
a
jury
of
men
condemned
by
men
taken
to
prison
by
a
man
and
by
a
man
she
hanged
where
in
all
this
were
peers
why
did
men
so
long
ago
insist
on
trial
by
a
jury
of
their
peers
so
that
justice
should
miscarry
was
it
a
man
peers
would
best
understand
his
circumstances
his
temptation
the
degree
of
his
guilt
yet
there
no
such
unlikeness
between
different
classes
of
men
as
exists
between
man
and
woman
what
man
has
the
knowledge
that
makes
him
a
fit
judge
of
woman
deeds
at
that
time
of
anguish
that
hour
her
voice
and
bends
over
the
that
hour
that
some
woman
struggled
through
to
put
each
man
here
into
the
world
i
noticed
when
a
previous
speaker
quoted
the
labour
party
you
applauded
some
of
you
here
i
gather
call
yourselves
labour
men
every
woman
who
has
borne
a
child
is
a
labour
woman
no
man
among
you
can
judge
what
she
goes
through
in
her
hour
of
darkness
jean
frightened
eyes
on
her
lover
set
white
face
geoffrey
miss
her
fluttering
breath
goes
on
very
in
that
great
agony
when
even
under
the
best
conditions
that
money
and
devotion
can
buy
many
a
woman
falls
into
temporary
mania
and
not
a
few
go
down
to
death
in
the
case
of
this
poor
little
abandoned
working
girl
what
man
can
be
the
fit
judge
of
her
deeds
in
that
awful
moment
of
temptation
women
know
of
these
things
as
those
know
burning
who
have
walked
through
fire
stonor
a
motion
jean
she
turns
away
fronting
the
audience
her
hands
go
up
to
her
throat
as
though
she
suffered
a
choking
sensation
it
is
in
her
face
that
she
knows
miss
levering
over
the
platform
and
speaks
with
a
low
and
thrilling
i
would
say
in
conclusion
to
the
women
here
it
not
enough
to
be
sorry
for
these
our
unfortunate
sisters
we
must
get
the
conditions
of
life
made
fairer
we
women
must
organise
we
must
learn
to
work
together
we
have
all
rich
and
poor
happy
and
unhappy
worked
so
long
and
so
exclusively
for
we
hardly
know
how
to
work
for
one
another
but
we
must
learn
those
who
can
may
give
money
voices
oh
yes

money
miss
those
who
have
pennies
to
give
even
those
people
are
so
poor
they
ca
give
some
part
of
their
labour
some
share
of
their
sympathy
and
support
to
hear
something

turns
for
the
last
time

the
crowd
silencing
the
general
murmur
and
holding
the
people
by
the
sudden
concentration
of
passion
in
her
i
do
mean
to
say
it
would
be
better
if
men

did
this
work
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
but
the
mass
of
men
wo
have
it
so
i

the
good

the
spirit
they
aroused

as
well
as
any
man
could
tell

would
be
a
bad
day
for

tumult

undeniable
and
then
when
she
said
that
at
the
meeting
about
the
dark
hour
and
i

flashed
over

a
long
time
ago
jean
and
why
could
you

of

his

have
been
terribly
hard
stonor
towards

you

and
stands
that
a
man
like
you
should
have
had
the
freedom
that
even
the
lowest
seem
to
have
stonor
freedom
jean
to
marry
the
woman
they
choose
stonor
she
did
break

young
to
discuss
such
a
story
turns
jean
i
not
so
young
as
she
was
when
stonor
upon
very
well
then
if
you
will
have
it
the
truth
is
it
did
seem
to
weigh
upon
her
as
it
seems
to
on
you
that
i
was
able
to
marry
her
jean
why
are
you
so
sure
of
that
stonor
because
she
did
so
much
as
hint
such
a
thing
when
she
wrote
that
she
meant
to
break
off
the
the

what
made
her
write
like
that

suppressed
why
you
go
on

reason
did
she
give

and
looks
blindly
out
and
speaks
in
a
low
if

have
been
possible
to
get
my
father
to

is
its
expression
so
tragically
eloquent
that
fear
for
the
first
time
catches
hold
of
i
am
glad
you
did
mean
to
desert
her
geoffrey
it
was
your
fault
after
all
only
some
misunderstanding
that
can
be
cleared
up
stonor
up
jean
yes
cleared
up
stonor
you
are
thinking
that
this
miserable
old
affair
i
as
good
as
forgotten
jean
a
whisper
with
a
glance
at
the
door
which
he
does
stonor
no
no
i
do
mean
exactly
forgotten
but
you
torturing
me
so
i
do
know
what
i
saying
goes
you
are
jean
you
you
are
going
to
let
it
come
between
you
and
me
jean
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
and
then
taking
it
away
answers
i
ca
make
or
unmake
what
past
but
i
glad
at
least
that
you
did
to
desert
her
in
her
trouble
remind
her
of
that
first
of
all
wo
you
to
the
stonor
where
are
you
going
his
why
should
i
remind
anybody
of
what
i
want
only
to
forget
jean
on
sh
stonor
eyes
on
the
you
do
mean
that
jean
yes
i
left
her
to
get
a
little
rest
recoils
in
an
access
of
uncontrollable
rage
she
follows
him
speechless
he
goes
get
his
geoffrey
do
go
before
you
hear
me
i
do
know
if
what
i
think
matters
to
you
now
but
i
hope
it
does
you
can
still
make
me
think
of
you
without
shrinking
if
you
will
stonor
her
a
moment
with
his
eyes
then
what
is
it
you
are
asking
of
me
jean
to
make
amends
geoffrey
stonor
an
you
poor
little
innocent
jean
i
poor
enough
but
her
hands
i
not
so
innocent
but
what
i
know
you
must
right
that
old
wrong
now
if
ever
to
right
it
stonor
you
are
insane
enough
to
think
i
would
turn
round
in
these
few
hours
and
go
back
to
something
that
ten
years
ago
was
ended
for
ever
why
it
stark
staring
madness
jean
no
on
his
what
you
did
ten
years
ago
was
mad
this
is
paying
a
debt
stonor
look
here
jean
you
dreadfully
wrought
up
and
excited
tired
too
jean
no
not
tired
though
i
travelled
so
far
i
know
you
smile
at
sudden
conversions
you
think
hysterical
worse
vulgar
but
people
must
get
their
revelation
how
they
can
and
geoffrey
if
i
ca
make
you
see
this
one
of
mine
i
shall
know
your
love
could
never
mean
strength
to
me
only
weakness
and
i
shall
be
afraid
so
afraid
i
never
dare
to
give
you
the
of
making
me
loathe
myself
i
shall
never
see
you
again
stonor
how
right
was
to
be
afraid
of
that
vein
of
fanaticism
in
you
towards
the
jean
certainly
you
could
make
a
greater
mistake
than
to
go
away
now
and
think
it
any
good
ever
to
come
back
even
if
i
came
to
feel
different
i
could
anything
different
i
should
know
all
this
could
be
forgotten
i
should
know
that
it
would
poison
my
life
in
the
end
yours
too
stonor
suppressed
she
has
made
good
use
of
her
time
a
sudden
what
has
changed
her
has
been
seeing
visions
too
jean
what
do
you
mean
stonor
why
is
she
intriguing
to
get
hold
of
a
man
that
ten
years
ago
she
flatly
refused
to
see
or
hold
any
communication
with
jean
intriguing
to
get
hold
of
she
has
mentioned
you
stonor
then
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
you
know
that
she
wants
what
you
ask
jean
there
ca
be
any
doubt
about
that
stonor
immense
you
absurd
ridiculous
child
then
all
this
is
just
your
own
unaided
invention
well
i
could
thank
god
into
the
nearest
chair
and
passes
his
handkerchief
over
his
jean
for
what
are
you
thanking
god
stonor
to
think
out
his
plan
of
suppose
i
not
going
to
risk
it
but
suppose
looks
up
and
at
the
sight
jean
a
new
tenderness
comes
into
his
own
he
rises
whether
i
deserve
to
suffer
or
not
it
quite
certain
do
do
cry
dear
one
it
never
was
the
real
thing
i
had
to
wait
till
i
knew
you
before
i
understood
jean
her
eyes
oh
is
that
true
her
movement
towards
loving
you
has
made
things
clear
to
me
i
dream
of
before
if
i
could
think
that
because
of
me
you
were
able
to
do
this
stonor
her
by
the
shoulders
and
says
look
here
do
you
seriously
ask
me
to
give
up
the
girl
i
love
to
go
and
offer
to
marry
a
woman
that
even
to
think
of
jean
you
cared
for
her
once
you
care
about
her
again
she
is
beautiful
and
brilliant

impulse

miss
but
there
something

point
where
he
recognises
that

one

the
thousands
with
hope
still
in
their
hearts
and
youth
in
their
blood
let
him
help
let
him
be
a
friend
to
women
jean
on
a
wave
of
yes
yes
i
understand
that
too
door
opens
stonor
lady
john
makes
a
slight
gesture
towards
the
two
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
jean
sight
of
thank
you
lady
john
a
clear
commonplace
tone
jean
well
you
rather
gave
us
the
slip
vida
i
believe
stonor
wants
to
see
you
for
a
few
minutes
at
but
i
like
a
word
with
you
first
as
i
must
get
back
stonor
do
you
think
the
car
your
man
said
something
about
stonor
oh
did
he
i
see
about
it
stonor
going
out
he
encounters
butler
stonor
butler
trent
has
called
miss
to
take
miss
levering
to
the
meeting
jean
bring
trent
into
my
i
tell
him
you
ca
go
butler
jean
lady
john
i
know
my
dear
not
aware
of
what
that
impulsive
girl
wants
to
insist
on
miss
yes
i
am
aware
of
it
lady
john
but
it
is
with
your
sanction
surely
that
she
goes
on
making
this
extraordinary
demand
miss
i
did
sanction
it
at
first
but
i
been
thinking
it
over
lady
john
then
all
i
can
say
is
i
am
greatly
disappointed
in
you
you
threw
this
man
over
years
ago
for
reasons
whatever
they
were
that
seemed
to
you
good
and
sufficient
and
now
you
come
between
him
and
a
younger
woman
just
to
play
nemesis
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
miss
is
that
what
he
says
lady
john
he
says
nothing
that
is
fair
and
considerate
miss
i
can
see
he
changed
lady
john
and
you
unchanged
is
that
it
miss
i
changed
even
more
than
he
lady
john
but
and
annoyance
blended
in
her
you
care
about
him
still
vida
miss
no
lady
john
i
see
it
just
that
you
wish
to
marry
somebody
miss
oh
lady
john
there
are
no
men
listening
lady
john
no
i
did
suppose
there
were
miss
then
why
keep
up
that
old
pretence
lady
john
what
pre
miss
that
to
marry
all
is
every
woman
dearest
ambition
till
the
grave
closes
over
her
you
and
i
it
is
true
lady
john
well
but
oh
it
was
just
the
unexpected
sight
of
him
bringing
it
back
was
what
fired
you
this
afternoon
an
honest
attempt
at
sympathetic
of
course
the
memory
of
a
thing
like
that
can
never
die
can
never
even
be
dimmed
the
miss
i
mean
her
to
think
so
lady
john
jean
miss
levering
lady
john
and
it
so
miss
you
do
seriously
believe
a
woman
with
anything
else
to
think
about
comes
to
the
end
of
ten
years
still
in
a
memory
of
that
sort
lady
john
you
got
over
it
then
miss
if
the
newspapers
did
remind
me
i
should
remember
once
a
twelvemonth
that
there
was
ever
such
a
person
as
geoffrey
stonor
in
the
world
lady
john
unconscious
oh
i
glad
miss
yes
i
glad
too
lady
john
and
if
geoffrey
stonor
offered
you
what
called
reparation
you
refuse
it
miss
a
little
geoffrey
stonor
for
me
he
simply
one
of
the
links
in
a
chain
of
evidence
certain
i
think
a
hundred
times
of
other
women
present
unhappiness
to
once
that
i
remember
that
old
unhappiness
of
mine
that
past
i
think
of
the
nail
and
chain
makers
of
cradley
heath
the
sweated
girls
of
the
slums
i
think
of
the
army
of
women
whose
very
existence
i
must
mention
lady
john
then
why
in
heaven
name
do
you
let
poor
jean
imagine
miss
look
i
trust
you
lady
john
i
suffer
from
that
old
wrong
as
jean
thinks
i
do
but
i
shall
coin
her
sympathy
into
gold
for
a
greater
cause
than
mine
lady
john
i
do
understand
you
miss
jean
is
old
enough
to
be
able
to
care
as
much
about
a
principle
as
about
a
person
but
if
my
pain
can
turn
her
generosity
into
the
common
treasury
lady
john
what
do
you
propose
she
shall
do
poor
child
miss
use
her
hold
over
geoffrey
stonor
to
make
him
help
us
lady
john
help
you
miss
the
man
who
served
one
woman
god
knows
how
many
more
very
ill
shall
serve
hundreds
of
thousands
well
geoffrey
stonor
shall
make
it
harder
for
his
son
harder
still
for
his
grandson
to
treat
any
woman
as
he
treated
me
lady
john
how
will
he
do
that
miss
by
putting
an
end
to
the
helplessness
of
women
lady
john
you
must
think
he
has
a
great
deal
of
power
miss
power
yes
men
have
too
much
over
penniless
and
frightened
women
lady
john
what
nonsense
you
talk
as
though
the
women
had
their
share
of
human
nature
are
made
of
ice
any
more
than
the
men
miss
no
but
all
the
same
we
have
more
lady
john
than
men
miss
you
know
we
have
lady
john
i
know
we
must
admit
it
miss
for
fear
they
call
us
fishes
lady
john
they
talk
of
our
lack
of
but
it
the
last
thing
they
women
to
have
miss
oh
we
know
what
they
want
us
to
have
so
we
make
shift
to
have
it
if
we
do
we
go
without
hope
sometimes
we
go
without
bread
lady
john
vida
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
miss
i
mean
to
say
that
men
vanity
wo
let
them
see
it
but
the
thing
largely
a
question
of
economics
lady
john
you
loved
him
then
miss
oh
yes
i
loved
him
it
was
my
helplessness
turned
the
best
thing
life
can
bring
into
a
curse
for
both
of
us
lady
john
i
do
understand
you
miss
oh
being
understood
that
too
much
to
expect
when
people
come
to
know
i
joined
the
union
lady
john
but
you
wo
miss
who
is
there
who
will
resist
the
temptation
to
say
poor
vida
levering
what
a
pity
she
has
got
a
husband
and
a
baby
to
keep
her
quiet
the
few
who
know
about
me
they
be
equally
sure
that
not
the
larger
view
of
life
i
gained
my
own
poor
little
story
is
responsible
for
my
new
departure
forward
and
looks
lady
john
my
best
friend
she
will
be
surest
of
all
that
it
a
private
sense
of
loss
or
lower
yet
a
grudge
but
i
tell
you
the
only
difference
between
me
and
thousands
of
women
with
husbands
and
babies
is
that
i
free
to
say
what
i
think
lady
john
and
looking
at
her
i
must
get
back
my
poor
guests
miss
i
wo
ring
i
think
you
find
stonor
downstairs
waiting
for
you
lady
john
oh
a
he
will
have
left
word
about
the
car
in
any
case
miss
levering
opened
the
allen
trent
in
the
act
of
saying
goodbye
jean
the
miss
well
trent
i
did
expect
to
see
you
this
evening
trent
and
stands
in
the
why
not
have
i
ever
failed
miss
lady
john
this
is
one
of
our
allies
he
is
good
enough
to
squire
me
through
the
rabble
from
time
to
time
lady
john
well
i
think
it
very
handsome
of
you
after
what
she
said
about
men
trent
i
no
great
opinion
of
most
men
myself
i
might
add
or
of
most
women
lady
john
oh
well
at
any
rate
i
shall
go
away
relieved
to
think
that
miss
levering
plain
speaking
has
alienated
masculine
regard
trent
why
should
it
lady
john
that
right
trent
do
believe
all
she
says
in
the
heat
of
propaganda
trent
i
do
believe
all
she
says
but
i
not
cast
down
lady
john
not
when
she
says
trent
was
there
never
a
mysogynist
of
my
sex
who
ended
by
deciding
to
make
an
exception
lady
john
oh
if
what
you
build
on
trent
well
why
should
a
on
your
side
prove
equally
open
to
reason
miss
that
part
of
the
question
does
concern
me
i
come
to
a
place
where
i
realise
that
the
first
battles
of
this
new
campaign
must
be
fought
by
women
alone
the
only
effective
help
men
could
give
amendment
of
the
law
they
refuse
the
rest
is
nothing
lady
john
do
be
ungrateful
vida
here
trent
ready
to
face
criticism
in
publicly
championing
you
miss
it
an
illusion
that
i
as
an
individual
need
trent
i
am
quite
safe
in
the
crowd
please
do
wait
for
me
and
do
come
for
me
again
trent
of
course
if
you
rather
miss
and
that
reminds
me
i
was
asked
to
thank
you
and
to
tell
you
too
that
they
the
women
of
the
union
they
wo
need
your
chairmanship
any
more

her
agitation

little
broken
at

these
years

brink
of
protest
checks

am
not
here
to
deny
it

stonor
moment

as
he
looks
at
her

have
promised
that

exact
it
i
will
miss
ah
if
i
insist

it
all
good
then
do
you
know

in
kind
stonor

me
back
what
you
took
from
me
my
old
faith

me
that
stonor
oh
if
you
mean
to
make
phrases

of
scant
miss
or
give
me
back
mere
kindness
or
even
tolerance
oh
i
do
mean
tolerance

me
back
the
power
to
think
fairly
of
my
brothers
not
as
mockers
thieves
stonor
i
have
not
mocked
you
and
i
have
asked
you
miss
something
you
knew
i
should
refuse
or
eyes
did
you
dare
to
be
afraid
i
would
stonor
i
suppose
if
we
set
our
teeth
we
could
miss
i
could
not
even
if
i
set
my
teeth
and
you
would
dream
of
asking
me
if
you
thought
there
was
the
smallest
chance
stonor
i
can
do
no
more
than
make
you
an
offer
of
such
reparation
as
is
in
my
power
if
you
do
accept
it
turns
with
an
air
of
that
done
miss
accept
it
no
go
away
and
live
in
debt
pay
and
pay
and
pay
and
find
yourself
still
in
debt
for
a
thing
you
never
be
able
to
give
me
back
and
when
you
come
to
die
say
to
yourself
i
paid
all
creditors
but
one
stonor
i
rather
tired
you
know
of
this
talk
of
debt
if
i
hear
that
you
persist
in
it
i
shall
have
to
miss
what
faces
stonor
no
i
keep
to
my
resolution
to
the
miss
what
resolution
stonor
i
came
here
under
considerable
pressure
to
speak
of
the
future
not
to
the
past
miss
the
future
and
the
past
are
one
stonor
you
talk
as
if
that
old
madness
was
mine
alone
it
is
the
woman
way
miss
i
know
and
it
not
fair
men
suffer
as
well
as
we
by
the
woman
starting
wrong
we
are
taught
to
think
the
man
a
sort
of
demigod
if
he
tells
her
go
down
into
hell
down
into
hell
she
goes
stonor
make
no
mistake
not
the
woman
alone
go
down
miss
yes
they
go
down
together
but
the
man
comes
up
alone
as
a
rule
it
is
more
convenient
so
for
him
and
for
the
other
woman
eyes
of
both
go
jean
stonor
my
conscience
is
clear
i
know
and
so
do
you
that
most
men
in
my
position
would
have
troubled
themselves
i
gave
myself
endless
trouble
miss
wondering
so
you
gone
about
all
these
years
feeling
that
you
discharged
every
obligation
stonor
not
only
that
i
stood
by
you
with
a
fidelity
that
was
nothing
short
of
quixotic
if
woman
like
you
recall
the
past
i
insist
on
your
recalling
it
correctly
miss
you
think
i
do
recall
it
correctly
stonor
not
when
you
make
other
people
believe
that
i
deserted
you
gathering
it
a
curious
enough
charge
when
you
stop
to
consider
himself
and
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
sweeps
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
miss
well
when
we
just
for
five
minutes
out
of
ten
years
when
we
do
stop
to
consider
stonor
we
remember
it
was
who
did
the
deserting
since
you
had
to
rake
the
story
up
you
might
have
had
the
fairness
to
tell
the
facts
miss
you
think
the
facts
would
have
excused
you
stonor
no
doubt
you
forgotten
them
since
lady
john
tells
me
you
would
remember
my
existence
once
a
year
if
the
newspapers
did
miss
ah
you
minded
that
stonor
manly
i
minded
your
giving
false
impressions
is
about
to
speak
he
advances
on
do
you
deny
that
you
returned
my
letters
unopened
miss
no
stonor
do
you
deny
that
you
refused
to
see
me
and
that
when
i
persisted
you
vanished
miss
i
do
deny
any
of
those
things
stonor
why
i
had
no
trace
of
you
for
years
miss
i
suppose
not
stonor
very
well
then
what
i
do
miss
nothing
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
stonor
it
was
too
late
you
knew
since
you
read
the
papers
that
my
father
died
that
same
year
there
was
no
longer
any
barrier
between
us
miss
oh
yes
there
was
a
barrier
stonor
of
your
own
making
then
miss
i
had
my
guilty
share
in
it
but
the
barrier
voice
the
barrier
was
your
invention
stonor
it
was
no
invention
if
you
had
ever
known
my
father
miss
oh
the
echoes
the
echoes
how
often
you
used
to
say
if
i
knew
your
father
but
you
said
too
you
called
the
greatest
barrier
by
another
name
stonor
what
name
miss
the
child
that
was
to
come
stonor
that
was
before
my
father
died
while
i
still
hoped
to
get
his
consent
miss
how
the
thought
of
that
personage
used
to
terrorise
me
what
chance
had
a
little
unborn
child
against
the
last
of
the
great
feudal
lords
as
you
called
him
stonor
you
the
child
would
have
stood
between
you
and
me
miss
i
know
the
child
stand
between
you
and
me
stonor
vague
it
stand
miss
happy
mothers
teach
their
children
mine
had
to
teach
me
stonor
you
talk
as
if
miss
teach
me
that
a
woman
may
do
a
thing
for
love
sake
that
shall
kill
love
stonor
and
putting
from
him
fuller
comprehension
rises
with
an
air
of
you
certainly
made
it
plain
you
had
no
love
left
for
me
miss
i
had
need
of
it
all
for
the
child
stonor
comes
closer
speaks
hurriedly
and
very
do
you
mean
then
that
after
all
it
lived
miss
no
i
mean
that
it
was
sacrificed
but
it
showed
me
no
barrier
is
so
impassable
as
the
one
a
little
child
can
raise
stonor
light
was
that
why
you
was
why
miss
speechless
a
day
and
night
there
it
was
between
my
thought
of
you
and
me
sits
again
staring
at
when
i
was
most
unhappy
i
would
wake
thinking
i
heard
it
cry
it
was
my
own
crying
i
heard
but
i
seemed
to
have
it
in
my
arms
i
suppose
i
was
mad
i
used
to
lie
there
in
that
lonely
farmhouse
pretending
to
hush
it
it
was
so
i
hushed
myself
stonor
i
never
knew
miss
i
did
blame
you
you
could
risk
being
with
me
stonor
you
agreed
that
for
both
our
sakes
miss
yes
you
had
to
be
very
circumspect
you
were
so
well
known
your
autocratic
father
your
brilliant
political
future
stonor
be
fair
future
as
i
saw
it
then
miss
yes
it
all
hung
on
concealment
it
must
have
looked
quite
simple
to
you
you
did
know
that
the
ghost
of
a
child
that
had
never
seen
the
light
the
frail
thing
you
meant
to
sweep
aside
and
forget
swept
aside
and
forgotten
you
did
know
it
was
strong
enough
to
push
you
out
of
my
life
with
an
added
it
can
do
more
over
him
and
it
can
push
that
girl
out
stonor
it
can
do
more
still
stonor
are
you
threatening
me
miss
no
i
am
preparing
you
stonor
for
what
miss
for
the
work
that
must
be
done
either
with
or
stonor
his
eyes
a
miss
one
of
two
things
either
her
life
and
all
she
has
given
to
this
new
service
or
a
ransom
if
i
give
her
up
to
you
stonor
i
see
a
price
well
miss
searchingly
in
his
face
hesitates
and
shakes
her
even
if
i
could
trust
you
to
pay
no
it
would
be
a
poor
bargain
to
give
her
up
for
anything
you
could
do
stonor
in
spite
of
your
assumption
she
may
not
be
your
tool
miss
you
are
horribly
afraid
she
is
but
you
are
wrong
do
think
it
merely
i
that
have
got
hold
of
jean
dunbarton
stonor
who
else
miss
the
new
spirit
that
abroad
stonor
away
with
an
exclamation
and
begins
to
pace
up
and
down
jean
miss
how
else
should
that
inexperienced
girl
have
felt
the
new
loyalty
and
responded
as
she
did
stonor
his
new
indeed
however
little
loyal
miss
loyal
above
all
but
no
newer
than
electricity
was
when
it
first
lit
up
the
world
it
had
been
there
since
the
world
began
waiting
to
do
away
with
the
dark
has
the
thing
stonor
voice
held
down
to
its
lowest
the
thing
fighting
is
nothing
more
than
one
person
hold
on
a
highly
sensitive
imagination
i
consented
to
this
interview
with
the
hope
gesture
of
it
only
remains
for
me
to
show
her
your
true
motive
is
revenge
miss
once
say
that
to
her
and
you
are
lost
stonor
his
look
is
the
look
of
a
man
who
sees
happiness
slipping
miss
i
know
what
it
is
that
men
fear
it
even
seems
as
if
it
must
be
through
fear
that
your
enlightenment
will
come
that
is
why
i
see
a
value
in
jean
dunbarton
far
beyond
her
fortune
stonor
his
eyes
dully
and
fixes
them
vida
miss
more
than
any
girl
i
know
if
i
keep
her
from
you
that
gentle
inflexible
creature
could
rouse
in
men
the
old
fear
stonor
fear
i
believe
you
are
mad
miss
l
mad
unsexed
these
are
the
words
in
the
middle
ages
men
cried
out
witch
and
burnt
her
the
woman
who
served
no
man
bed
or
board
stonor
you
want
to
make
that
poor
child
believe
miss
she
sees
for
herself
we
come
to
a
place
where
we
find
there
a
value
in
women
apart
from
the
value
men
see
in
them
you
teach
us
not
to
look
to
you
for
some
of
the
things
we
need
most
if
women
must
be
freed
by
women
we
have
need
of
such
as
eyes
go
jean
who
knows
she
may
be
the
new
joan
of
arc
stonor
that
should
be
the
sacrifice
miss
you
have
taught
us
to
look
very
calmly
on
the
sacrifice
of
women
men
tell
us
in
every
tongue
it
a
necessary
evil
stonor
rooted
staring
at
the
miss
one
girl
happiness
against
a
thing
nobler
than
happiness
for
thousands
who
can
hesitate
stonor
good
god
ca
you
see
that
this
crazed
campaign
you
start
her
on
even
if
it
successful
it
can
only
be
so
through
the
help
of
men
what
excuse
shall
you
make
your
own
soul
for
not
going
straight
to
the
goal
miss
you
think
we
would
be
glad
to
go
straight
to
the
goal
stonor
i
do
i
see
you
much
rather
punish
me
and
see
her
revel
in
a
morbid
miss
you
say
i
want
to
punish
you
only
because
like
most
men
you
wo
take
the
trouble
to
understand
what
we
do
want
or
how
determined
we
are
to
have
it
you
ca
kill
this
new
spirit
among
women
and
you
could
make
a
greater
mistake
than
to
think
it
finds
a
home
only
in
the
exceptional
or
the
unhappy
it
so
strange
geoffrey
to
see
a
man
like
you
as
much
deluded
as
the
hyde
park
loafers
who
say
to
ernestine
blunt
who
hurt
feelings
why
not
realise
quite
close
to
this
is
a
thing
that
goes
deeper
than
personal
experience
and
yet
her
voice
and
glancing
at
the
if
you
take
only
the
narrowest
personal
view
a
good
deal
depends
on
what
you
and
i
agree
upon
in
the
next
five
minutes
stonor
her
farther
away
from
the
you
recommend
my
realising
the
larger
issues
but
in
your
ambition
to
attach
that
girl
to
the
chariot
wheels
of
progress
you
quite
ignore
the
fact
that
people
fitter
for
such
work
the
men
you
look
to
enlist
in
the
end
are
ready
waiting
to
give
the
thing
a
chance
miss
men
are
ready
what
men
stonor
her
eyes
picking
his
women
have
themselves
to
blame
that
the
question
has
grown
so
delicate
that
responsible
people
shrink
for
the
moment
from
being
implicated
in
it
miss
we
have
seen
the
shrinking
stonor
without
quoting
any
one
else
i
might
point
out
that
the
new
antagonism
seems
to
have
blinded
you
to
the
small
fact
that
i
for
one
am
not
an
opponent
miss
the
phrase
a
familiar
ring
we
have
heard
it
from
four
hundred
and
twenty
others
stonor
i
spoke
if
i
may
say
so
of
some
one
who
would
count
some
one
who
can
carry
his
party
along
with
him
or
risk
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
miss
did
you
mean
you
are
ready
to
do
that
stonor
an
hour
ago
i
was
miss
l
ah
an
hour
ago
stonor
exactly
you
do
understand
men
they
can
be
led
they
be
driven
ten
minutes
before
you
came
into
the
room
i
was
ready
to
say
i
would
throw
in
my
political
lot
with
this
reform
miss
and
now
stonor
now
you
block
my
way
by
an
attempt
at
coercion
by
forcing
my
hand
you
give
my
adherence
an
air
of
for
a
personal
end
exactly
the
mistake
of
the
ignorant
agitators
of
your
union
as
you
call
it
you
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
this
movement
will
go
forward
not
because
of
the
agitation
but
in
spite
of
it
there
are
men
in
parliament
who
would
have
been
actively
serving
the
reform
as
actively
as
so
vast
a
constitutional
change
miss
and
they
have
done
it
because
stonor
because
it
would
have
put
a
premium
on
breaches
of
decent
behaviour
takes
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
out
of
his
look
here
miss
with
excitement
as
she
reads
the
this
is
very
good
i
see
only
one
objection
stonor
objection
miss
you
have
sent
it
stonor
is
your
fault
miss
when
did
you
write
this
stonor
just
before
you
came
in
when
glances
at
the
miss
ah
it
must
have
pleased
jean
that
message
him
back
the
stonor
at
her
yielding
it
up
so
lightly
and
jean
not
so
much
as
read
it
he
throws
himself
heavily
into
a
chair
and
drops
his
head
in
his
miss
i
could
drive
a
bargain
with
you
but
i
think
i
wo
if
love
and
ambition
urge
you
on
perhaps
gazes
at
the
slack
hopeless
figure
with
its
sudden
look
of
age
goes
over
silently
and
stands
by
his
after
all
life

as
she
goes
towards
the
folding
why
should
you
think
that
it
only
you
these
ten
years
have
taught
something
to
why
not
give
even
a
man
credit
for
a
willingness
to
learn
something
of
life
and
for
being
sorry
profoundly
sorry
for
the
pain
his
instruction
has
cost
others
you
seem
to
think
i
taken
it
all
quite
lightly

thought
of

of
the

more
than
ever
you
have
lost
your
beauty
miss
the
gods
saw
it
was
so
little
effectual
it
was
worth
taking
away
stands
looking
out
into
the
one
mishap
what
is
that
a
thing
as
trivial
to
the
great
world
as
sordid
in
most
eyes
but
the
time
has
come
when
a
woman
may
look
about
her
and
say
what
general
significance
has
my
secret
pain
does
it
on
to
anything
and
i
find
it
does
i
no
longer
merely
a
woman
who
has
stumbled
on
the
way
i
one
controls
with
difficulty
the
shake
in
her
who
has
got
up
bruised
and
bleeding
wiped
the
dust
from
her
hands
and
the
tears
from
her
face
and
said
to
herself
not
merely
here
one
luckless
woman
but
here
is
a
stone
of
stumbling
to
many
let
see
if
it
ca
be
moved
out
of
other
women
way
and
she
calls
people
to
come
and
help
no
mortal
man
let
alone
a
woman
can
move
that
rock
of
offence
but
a
sudden
sombre
flame
of
if

done
