introduction
to
volume
four
the
three
books
gathered
under
the
title
in
search
of
the
castaways
occupied
much
of
verne
s
attention
during
the
three
years
following
the
characters
used
in
these
books
were
afterwards
reintroduced
in
the
mysterious
island
which
was
in
its
turn
a
sequel
to
twenty
thousand
leagues
under
the
thus
this
entire
set
of
books
form
a
united
series
upon
which
verne
worked
intermittently
during
ten
years
in
search
of
the
castaways
which
has
also
been
published
as
the
children
of
captain
grant
and
as
a
voyage
around
the
world
is
perhaps
most
interesting
in
connection
with
the
last
of
these
titles
it
is
our
author
s
first
distinctly
geographical
romance
by
an
ingenious
device
he
sets
before
the
rescuers
a
search
which
compels
their
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
around
a
certain
parallel
of
the
southern
hemisphere
thus
they
cross
in
turn
through
south
america
australia
and
new
zealand
besides
visiting
minor
islands
the
three
great
regions
form
the
of
the
three
books
which
compose
the
story
in
each
region
the
rescuers
meet
with
adventures
characteristic
of
the
land
they
encounter
indians
in
america
bushrangers
in
australia
and
maoris
in
new
zealand
the
passage
of
the
searching
party
gives
ground
one
is
almost
tempted
to
say
excuse
for
a
close
and
careful
description
of
each
country
and
of
its
inhabitants
step
by
step
even
the
lesser
incidents
of
the
story
are
employed
to
emphasise
the
distinctive
features
of
each
land
the
explorers
are
almost
frozen
on
the
heights
of
the
andes
and
almost
drowned
in
the
floods
of
the
patagonian
pampas
an
avalanche
sweeps
some
of
them
away
a
condor
carries
off
a
lad
in
australia
they
are
stopped
by
jungles
and
by
quagmires
they
hunt
kangaroos
in
new
zealand
they
take
refuge
amid
hot
sulphur
springs
and
in
a
house
tabooed
they
escape
by
starting
a
volcano
into
eruption
here
then
are
fancy
and
extravagance
mixed
with
truth
and
information
verne
has
done
a
vast
and
useful
work
in
stimulating
the
interest
not
only
of
frenchmen
but
of
all
civilised
nations
with
regard
to
the
lesser
known
regions
of
our
globe
he
has
broadened
knowledge
and
guided
study
during
the
years
following
he
even
for
a
time
deserted
his
favorite
field
of
labor
fiction
and
devoted
himself
to
a
popular
book
now
superseded
by
later
works
entitled
the
illustrated
geography
of
france
and
her
verne
has
perhaps
had
a
larger
share
than
any
other
single
individual
in
causing
the
yearly
tide
of
international
travel
and
because
with
mutual
knowledge
among
the
nations
comes
mutual
understanding
and
appreciation
mutual
brotherhood
hence
jules

was
one
of
the
first
and
greatest

those
teachers
who
are
now
leading
us
toward
international

chapter
i
the
shark
on
the
of
july
a
magnificent
yacht
was
steaming
along
the
north
channel
at
full
speed
with
a
strong
breeze
blowing
from
the
the
union
jack
was
flying
at
the
and
a
blue
standard
bearing
the
initials
embroidered
in
gold
and
surmounted
by
a
ducal
coronet
floated
from
the
topgallant
head
of
the
the
name
of
the
yacht
was
the
duncan
and
the
owner
was
lord
glenarvan
one
of
the
sixteen
scotch
peers
who
sit
in
the
upper
house
and
the
most
distinguished
member
of
the
royal
thames
yacht
club
so
famous
throughout
the
united
kingdom
lord
edward
glenarvan
was
on
board
with
his
young
wife
lady
helena
and
one
of
his
cousins
major
mcnabbs
the
duncan
was
newly
built
and
had
been
making
a
trial
trip
a
few
miles
outside
the
firth
of
clyde
she
was
returning
to
glasgow
and
the
isle
of
arran
already
loomed
in
the
distance
when
the
sailor
on
watch
caught
sight
of
an
enormous
fish
sporting
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
lord
edward
who
was
immediately
apprised
of
the
fact
came
up
on
the
poop
a
few
minutes
after
with
his
cousin
and
asked
john
mangles
the
captain
what
sort
of
an
animal
he
thought
it
was
well
since
your
lordship
asks
my
opinion
said
mangles
i
think
it
is
a
shark
and
a
fine
large
one
a
shark
on
these
shores
there
is
nothing
at
all
improbable
in
that
returned
the
captain
this
fish
belongs
to
a
species
that
is
found
in
all
latitudes
and
in
all
seas
it
is
the
or
shark
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
but
if
your
lordship
has
no
objections
and
it
would
give
the
smallest
pleasure
to
lady
helena
to
see
a
novelty
in
the
way
of
fishing
we
ll
soon
haul
up
the
monster
and
find
out
what
it
really
what
do
you
say
mcnabbs
shall
we
try
to
catch
it
asked
lord
glenarvan
if
you
like
it
s
all
one
to
me
was
his
cousin
s
cool
reply
the
more
of
those
terrible
creatures
that
are
killed
the
better
at
all
events
said
john
mangles
so
let
s
seize
the
chance
and
it
will
not
only
give
us
a
little
diversion
but
be
doing
a
good
very
well
set
to
work
then
said
glenarvan
lady
helena
soon
joined
her
husband
on
deck
quite
charmed
at
the
prospect
of
such
exciting
sport
the
sea
was
splendid
and
every
movement
of
the
shark
was
distinctly
visible
in
obedience
to
the
captain
s
orders
the
sailors
threw
a
strong
rope
over
the
starboard
side
of
the
yacht
with
a
big
hook
at
the
end
of
it
concealed
in
a
thick
lump
of
bacon
the
bait
took
at
once
though
the
shark
was
full
fifty
yards
distant
he
began
to
make
rapidly
for
the
yacht
beating
the
waves
violently
with
his
fins
and
keeping
his
tail
in
a
perfectly
straight
line
as
he
got
nearer
his
great
projecting
eyes
could
be
seen
inflamed
with
greed
and
his
gaping
jaws
with
their
quadruple
row
of
teeth
his
head
was
large
and
shaped
like
a
double
hammer
at
the
end
of
a
handle
john
mangles
was
right
this
was
evidently
a
the
most
voracious
of
all
the
squalidae
species
the
passengers
and
sailors
on
the
yacht
were
watching
all
the
animal
s
movements
with
the
liveliest
interest
he
soon
came
within
reach
of
the
bait
turned
over
on
his
back
to
make
a
good
dart
at
it
and
in
a
second
bacon
and
contents
had
disappeared
he
had
hooked
himself
now
as
the
tremendous
jerk
he
gave
the
cable
proved
and
the
sailors
began
to
haul
in
the
monster
by
means
of
tackle
attached
to
the
mainyard
he
struggled
desperately
but
his
captors
were
prepared
for
his
violence
and
had
a
long
rope
ready
with
a
slip
knot
which
caught
his
tail
and
rendered
him
powerless
at
once
in
a
few
minutes
more
he
was
hoisted
up
over
the
side
of
the
yacht
and
thrown
on
the
deck
a
man
came
forward
immediately
hatchet
in
hand
and
approaching
him
cautiously
with
one
powerful
stroke
cut
off
his
tail
this
ended
the
business
for
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
of
the
shark
but
though
the
sailors
vengeance
was
satisfied
their
curiosity
was
not
they
knew
the
brute
had
no
very
delicate
appetite
and
the
contents
of
his
stomach
might
be
worth
investigation
this
is
the
common
practice
on
all
ships
when
a
shark
is
captured
but
lady
glenarvan
declined
to
be
present
at
such
a
disgusting
exploration
and
withdrew
to
the
cabin
again
the
fish
was
still
breathing
it
measured
ten
feet
in
length
and
weighed
more
than
six
hundred
pounds
this
was
nothing
extraordinary
for
though
the
shark
is
not
classed
among
the
most
gigantic
of
the
species
it
is
always
reckoned
among
the
most
formidable
the
huge
brute
was
soon
ripped
up
in
a
very
unceremonious
fashion
the
hook
had
fixed
right
in
the
stomach
which
was
found
to
be
absolutely
empty
and
the
disappointed
sailors
were
just
going
to
throw
the
remains
overboard
when
the
boatswain
s
attention
was
attracted
by
some
large
object
sticking
fast
in
one
of
the
viscera
i
say
what
s
this
he
exclaimed
that
replied
one
of
the
sailors
why
it
s
a
piece
of
rock
the
beast
swallowed
by
way
of
it
s
just
a
bottle
neither
more
nor
less
that
the
fellow
has
got
in
his
inside
and
couldn
t
digest
said
another
of
the
crew
hold
your
tongues
all
of
you
said
tom
austin
the
mate
of
the
duncan
don
t
you
see
the
animal
has
been
such
an
inveterate
tippler
that
he
has
not
only
drunk
the
wine
but
swallowed
the
bottle
what
said
lord
glenarvan
do
you
mean
to
say
it
is
a
bottle
that
the
shark
has
got
in
his
ay
it
is
a
bottle
most
certainly
replied
the
boatswain
but
not
just
from
the
well
tom
be
careful
how
you
take
it
out
said
lord
glenarvan
for
bottles
found
in
the
sea
often
contain
precious
do
you
think
this
does
said
major
mcnabbs
incredulously
it
possibly
may
at
any
oh
i
m
not
saying
it
doesn
t
there
may
perhaps
be
some
secret
in
it
returned
the
major
that
s
just
what
we
re
to
see
said
his
cousin
well
here
it
is
said
the
mate
holding
up
a
shapeless
lump
he
had
managed
to
pull
out
though
with
some
difficulty
get
the
filthy
thing
washed
then
and
bring
it
to
the
tom
obeyed
and
in
a
few
minutes
brought
in
the
bottle
and
laid
it
on
the
table
at
which
lord
glenarvan
and
the
major
were
sitting
ready
with
the
captain
and
of
course
lady
helena
for
women
they
say
are
always
a
little
curious
everything
is
an
event
at
sea
for
a
moment
they
all
sat
silent
gazing
at
this
frail
relic
wondering
if
it
told
the
tale
of
sad
disaster
or
brought
some
trifling
message
from
a
sailor
who
had
flung
it
into
the
sea
to
amuse
himself
when
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
however
the
only
way
to
know
was
to
examine
the
bottle
and
glenarvan
set
to
work
without
further
delay
so
carefully
and
minutely
that
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
coroner
making
an
inquest
he
commenced
by
a
close
inspection
of
the
outside
the
neck
was
long
and
slender
and
round
the
thick
rim
there
was
still
an
end
of
wire
hanging
though
eaten
away
with
rust
the
sides
were
very
thick
and
strong
enough
to
bear
great
pressure
it
was
evidently
of
champagne
origin
and
the
major
said
immediately
that
s
one
of
our
clicquot
s
nobody
contradicted
him
as
he
was
supposed
to
know
but
lady
helena
exclaimed
what
does
it
matter
about
the
bottle
if
we
don
t
know
where
it
comes
from
we
shall
know
that
too
presently
and
we
may
affirm
this
much
already
it
comes
from
a
long
way
off
look
at
those
petrifactions
all
over
it
these
different
substances
almost
turned
to
mineral
we
might
say
through
the
action
of
the
salt
water
this
waif
had
been
tossing
about
in
the
ocean
a
long
time
before
the
shark
swallowed
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
mcnabbs
i
dare
say
this
frail
concern
has
made
a
long
voyage
protected
by
this
strong
but
i
want
to
know
where
from
said
lady
glenarvan
wait
a
little
dear
helena
wait
we
must
have
patience
with
bottles
but
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
this
one
will
answer
all
our
questions
replied
her
husband
beginning
to
scrape
away
the
hard
substances
round
the
neck
soon
the
cork
made
its
appearance
but
much
damaged
by
the
water
that
s
vexing
said
lord
edward
for
if
papers
are
inside
they
ll
be
in
a
pretty
state
it
s
to
be
feared
they
will
said
the
major
but
it
is
a
lucky
thing
the
shark
swallowed
them
i
must
say
added
glenarvan
for
the
bottle
would
have
sunk
to
the
bottom
before
long
with
such
a
cork
as
that
s
true
enough
replied
john
mangles
and
yet
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
fished
them
up
in
the
open
sea
then
we
might
have
found
out
the
road
they
had
come
by
taking
the
exact
latitude
and
longitude
and
studying
the
atmospheric
and
submarine
currents
but
with
such
a
postman
as
a
shark
that
goes
against
wind
and
tide
there
s
no
clew
whatever
to
the
we
shall
see
said
glenarvan
gently
taking
out
the
cork
a
strong
odor
of
salt
water
pervaded
the
whole
saloon
and
lady
helena
asked
impatiently
well
what
is
there
i
was
right
exclaimed
glenarvan
i
see
papers
inside
but
i
fear
it
will
be
impossible
to
remove
them
he
added
for
they
appear
to
have
rotted
with
the
damp
and
are
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
break
it
said
the
major
i
would
rather
preserve
the
whole
if
i
no
doubt
you
would
said
lady
helena
but
the
contents
are
more
valuable
than
the
bottle
and
we
had
better
sacrifice
the
one
than
the
if
your
lordship
would
simply
break
off
the
neck
i
think
we
might
easily
withdraw
the
papers
suggested
john
mangles
try
it
edward
try
it
said
lady
helena
lord
glenarvan
was
very
unwilling
but
he
found
there
was
no
alternative
the
precious
bottle
must
be
broken
they
had
to
get
a
hammer
before
this
could
be
done
though
for
the
stony
material
had
acquired
the
hardness
of
granite
a
few
sharp
strokes
however
soon
shivered
it
to
fragments
many
of
which
had
pieces
of
paper
sticking
to
them
these
were
carefully
removed
by
lord
glenarvan
and
separated
and
spread
out
on
the
table
before
the
eager
gaze
of
his
wife
and
friends
chapter
ii
the
three
documents
all
that
could
be
discovered
however
on
these
pieces
of
paper
was
a
few
words
here
and
there
the
remainder
of
the
lines
being
almost
completely
obliterated
by
the
action
of
the
water
lord
glenarvan
examined
them
attentively
for
a
few
minutes
turning
them
over
on
all
sides
holding
them
up
to
the
light
and
trying
to
decipher
the
least
scrap
of
writing
while
the
others
looked
on
with
anxious
eyes
at
last
he
said
there
are
three
distinct
documents
here
apparently
copies
of
the
same
document
in
three
different
languages
here
is
one
in
english
one
in
french
and
one
in
but
can
you
make
any
sense
out
of
them
asked
lady
helena
that
s
hard
to
say
my
dear
helena
the
words
are
quite
perhaps
the
one
may
supplement
the
other
suggested
major
mcnabbs
very
likely
they
will
said
the
captain
it
is
impossible
that
the
very
same
words
should
have
been
effaced
in
each
document
and
by
putting
the
scraps
together
we
might
gather
some
intelligible
meaning
out
of
that
s
what
we
will
do
rejoined
lord
glenarvan
but
let
us
proceed
methodically
here
is
the
english
document
all
that
remained
of
it
was
the
following
gow
sink
stra
aland
skipp
gr
that
monit
of
long
and
ssistance
there
s
not
much
to
be
made
out
of
that
said
the
major
looking
disappointed
no
but
it
is
good
english
anyhow
returned
the
captain
there
s
no
doubt
of
it
said
glenarvan
the
words
sink
aland
lost
are
entire
skipp
is
evidently
part
of
the
word
skipper
and
that
s
what
they
call
ship
captains
often
in
england
there
seems
a
gr
mentioned
and
that
most
likely
is
the
captain
of
the
shipwrecked
well
come
we
have
made
out
a
good
deal
already
said
lady
helena
yes
but
unfortunately
there
are
whole
lines
wanting
said
the
major
and
we
have
neither
the
name
of
the
ship
nor
the
place
where
she
was
we
ll
get
that
by
and
by
said
edward
oh
yes
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
replied
the
major
who
always
echoed
his
neighbor
s
opinion
but
how
by
comparing
one
document
with
the
let
us
try
them
said
his
wife
the
second
piece
of
paper
was
even
more
destroyed
than
the
first
only
a
few
scattered
words
remained
here
and
there
it
ran
as
follows
juni
glas
zwei
atrosen
graus
bringt
ihnen
this
is
written
in
german
said
john
mangles
the
moment
he
looked
at
it
and
you
understand
that
language
don
t
you
asked
lord
glenarvan
come
then
tell
us
the
meaning
of
these
the
captain
examined
the
document
carefully
and
said
well
here
s
the
date
of
the
occurrence
first
juni
means
june
and
if
we
put
that
before
the
figures
we
have
in
the
other
document
it
gives
us
the
exact
date
of
june
capital
exclaimed
lady
helena
go
on
john
on
the
same
line
resumed
the
young
captain
there
is
the
syllable
glas
and
if
we
add
that
to
the
gow
we
found
in
the
english
paper
we
get
the
whole
word
glasgow
at
once
the
documents
evidently
refer
to
some
ship
that
sailed
out
of
the
port
of
that
is
my
opinion
too
said
the
major
the
second
line
is
completely
effaced
continued
the
captain
but
here
are
two
important
words
on
the
third
there
is
zwei
which
means
two
and
atrosen
or
matrosen
the
german
for
then
i
suppose
it
is
about
a
captain
and
two
sailors
said
lady
helena
it
seems
so
replied
lord
glenarvan
i
must
confess
your
lordship
that
the
next
word
puzzles
me
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
perhaps
the
third
document
may
throw
some
light
on
it
the
last
two
words
are
plain
enough
bringt
ihnen
means
bring
them
and
if
you
recollect
in
the
english
paper
we
had
ssistance
so
by
putting
the
parts
together
it
reads
thus
i
think
bring
them
yes
that
must
be
it
replied
lord
glenarvan
but
where
are
the
poor
fellows
we
have
not
the
slightest
indication
of
the
place
meantime
nor
of
where
the
catastrophe
perhaps
the
french
copy
will
be
more
explicit
suggested
lady
helena
here
it
is
then
said
lord
glenarvan
and
that
is
in
a
language
we
all
the
words
it
contained
were
these
troi
ats
tannia
gonie
austral
abor
contin
pr
cruel
indi
jete
ongit
et
degrees
lat
there
are
figures
exclaimed
lady
helena
look
let
us
go
steadily
to
work
said
lord
glenarvan
and
begin
at
the
beginning
i
think
we
can
make
out
from
the
incomplete
words
in
the
first
line
that
a
vessel
is
in
question
and
there
is
little
doubt
about
the
name
we
get
that
from
the
fragments
of
the
other
papers
it
is
the
britannia
as
to
the
next
two
words
gonie
and
austral
it
is
only
austral
that
has
any
meaning
to
but
that
is
a
valuable
scrap
of
information
said
john
mangles
the
shipwreck
occurred
in
the
southern
that
s
a
wide
world
said
the
major
well
we
ll
go
on
resumed
glenarvan
here
is
the
word
abor
that
is
clearly
the
root
of
the
verb
aborder
the
poor
men
have
landed
somewhere
but
where
contin
does
that
mean
continent
cruel
cruel
interrupted
john
mangles
i
see
now
what
graus
is
part
of
in
the
second
document
it
is
grausam
the
word
in
german
for
cruel
let
s
go
on
said
lord
glenarvan
becoming
quite
excited
over
his
task
as
the
incomplete
words
began
to
fill
up
and
develop
their
meaning
indi
is
it
india
where
they
have
been
shipwrecked
and
what
can
this
word
ongit
be
part
of
ah
i
see
it
is
longitude
and
here
is
the
latitude
degrees
that
is
the
precise
indication
at
last
then
but
we
haven
t
the
longitude
objected
mcnabbs
but
we
can
t
get
everything
my
dear
major
and
it
is
something
at
all
events
to
have
the
exact
latitude
the
french
document
is
decidedly
the
most
complete
of
the
three
but
it
is
plain
enough
that
each
is
the
literal
translation
of
the
other
for
they
all
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
lines
what
we
have
to
do
now
is
to
put
together
all
the
words
we
have
found
and
translate
them
into
one
language
and
try
to
ascertain
their
most
probable
and
logical
well
what
language
shall
we
choose
asked
the
major
i
think
we
had
better
keep
to
the
french
since
that
was
the
most
complete
document
of
the
your
lordship
is
right
said
john
mangles
and
besides
we
re
all
familiar
with
the
very
well
then
i
ll
set
to
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
written
as
follows

lost
just
at
that
moment
one
of
the
sailors
came
to
inform
the
captain
that
they
were
about
entering
the
firth
of
clyde
and
to
ask
what
were
his
orders
what
are
your
lordship
s
intentions
said
john
mangles
addressing
lord
glenarvan
to
get
to
dunbarton
as
quickly
as
possible
john
and
lady
helena
will
return
to
malcolm
castle
while
i
go
on
to
london
and
lay
this
document
before
the
the
sailor
received
orders
accordingly
and
went
out
to
deliver
them
to
the
mate
now
friends
said
lord
glenarvan
let
us
go
on
with
our
investigations
for
we
are
on
the
track
of
a
great
catastrophe
and
the
lives
of
several
human
beings
depend
on
our
sagacity
we
must
give
our
whole
minds
to
the
solution
of
this
first
of
all
there
are
three
very
distinct
things
to
be
considered
in
this
document
the
things
we
know
the
things
we
may
conjecture
the
things
we
do
not
what
are
those
we
know
we
know
that
on
the
of
june
a
vessel
the
britannia
of
glasgow
foundered
that
two
sailors
and
the
captain
threw
this
document
into
the
sea
in
degrees
latitude
and
they
entreat
exactly
so
said
the
major
what
are
those
now
we
may
conjecture
continued
glenarvan
that
the
shipwreck
occurred
in
the
southern
seas
and
here
i
would
draw
your
attention
at
once
to
the
incomplete
word
gonie
doesn
t
the
name
of
the
country
strike
you
even
in
the
mere
mention
of
it
patagonia
exclaimed
lady
helena
but
is
patagonia
crossed
by
the
parallel
asked
the
major
that
is
easily
ascertained
said
the
captain
opening
a
map
of
south
america
yes
it
is
patagonia
just
touches
the
parallel
it
cuts
through
araucania
goes
along
over
the
pampas
to
the
north
and
loses
itself
in
the
well
let
us
proceed
then
with
our
conjectures
the
two
sailors
and
the
captain
land
land
where
contin
on
a
continent
on
a
continent
mark
you
not
an
island
what
becomes
of
them
there
are
two
letters
here
providentially
which
give
a
clew
to
their
fate
pr
that
must
mean
prisoners
and
cruel
indian
is
evidently
the
meaning
of
the
next
two
words
these
unfortunate
men
are
captives
in
the
hands
of
cruel
indians
don
t
you
see
it
don
t
the
words
seem
to
come
of
themselves
and
fill
up
the
blanks
isn
t
the
document
quite
clear
now
isn
t
the
sense
glenarvan
spoke
in
a
tone
of
absolute
conviction
and
his
enthusiastic
confidence
appeared
contagious
for
the
others
all
exclaimed
too
yes
it
is
evident
quite
evident
after
an
instant
lord
edward
said
again
to
my
own
mind
the
hypothesis
is
so
plausible
that
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
the
event
occurred
on
the
coast
of
patagonia
but
still
i
will
have
inquiries
made
in
glasgow
as
to
the
destination
of
the
britannia
and
we
shall
know
if
it
is
possible
she
could
have
been
wrecked
on
those
oh
there
s
no
need
to
send
so
far
to
find
out
that
said
john
mangles
i
have
the
and
shipping
here
and
we
ll
see
the
name
on
the
list
and
all
about
do
look
at
once
then
said
lord
glenarvan
the
file
of
papers
for
the
year
was
soon
brought
and
john
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
rapidly
running
down
each
page
with
his
eye
in
search
of
the
name
required
but
his
quest
was
not
long
for
in
a
few
minutes
he
called
out
i
ve
got
it
may
with
cargo
for
glasgow
the
britannia
captain
grant
exclaimed
lord
glenarvan
that
is
the
adventurous
scotchman
that
attempted
to
found
a
new
scotland
on
the
shores
of
the
yes
rejoined
john
mangles
it
is
the
very
man
he
sailed
from
glasgow
in
the
britannia
in
and
has
not
been
heard
of
there
isn
t
a
doubt
of
it
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
repeated
lord
glenarvan
it
is
just
that
same
captain
grant
the
britannia
left
callao
on
the
of
may
and
on
the
of
june
a
week
afterward
she
is
lost
on
the
coast
of
patagonia
the
few
broken
disjointed
words
we
find
in
these
documents
tell
us
the
whole
story
you
see
friends
our
conjectures
hit
the
mark
very
well
we
know
all
now
except
one
thing
and
that
is
the
that
is
not
needed
now
we
know
the
country
with
the
latitude
alone
i
would
engage
to
go
right
to
the
place
where
the
wreck
then
have
we
really
all
the
particulars
now
asked
lady
helena
all
dear
helena
i
can
fill
up
every
one
of
these
blanks
the
sea
has
made
in
the
document
as
easily
as
if
captain
grant
were
dictating
to
and
he
took
up
the
pen
and
dashed
off
the
following
lines
immediately
on
the
of
june
the
vessel
britannia
of
glasgow
has
sunk
on
the
coast
of
patagonia
in
the
southern
hemisphere
making
for
the
shore
two
sailors
and
captain
grant
are
about
to
land
on
the
continent
where
they
will
be
taken
prisoners
by
cruel
indians
they
have
thrown
this
document
into
the
sea
in
longitude
and
latitude
degrees
bring
them
assistance
or
they
are
capital
capital
dear
edward
said
lady
helena
if
those
poor
creatures
ever
see
their
native
land
again
it
is
you
they
will
have
to
thank
for
and
they
will
see
it
again
returned
lord
glenarvan
the
statement
is
too
explicit
and
clear
and
certain
for
england
to
hesitate
about
going
to
the
aid
of
her
three
sons
cast
away
on
a
desert
coast
what
she
has
done
for
franklin
and
so
many
others
she
will
do
for
these
poor
shipwrecked
fellows
of
the
most
likely
the
unfortunate
men
have
families
who
mourn
their
loss
perhaps
this
captain
grant
had
a
wife
and
children
suggested
lady
helena
very
true
my
dear
and
i
ll
not
forget
to
let
them
know
that
there
is
still
hope
but
now
friends
we
had
better
go
up
on
deck
as
the
boat
must
be
getting
near
the
a
carriage
and
waited
there
in
readiness
to
convey
lady
helena
and
major
mcnabbs
to
malcolm
castle
and
lord
glenarvan
bade
adieu
to
his
young
wife
and
jumped
into
the
express
train
for
glasgow
but
before
starting
he
confided
an
important
missive
to
a
swifter
agent
than
himself
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
it
flashed
along
the
electric
wire
to
london
to
appear
next
day
in
the
and
morning
in
the
following
words
for
information
respecting
the
fate
of
the
vessel
britannia
of
glasgow
captain
grant
apply
to
lord
glenarvan
malcolm
castle
luss
dumbartonshire
chapter
iii
the
captain
s
children
lord
glenarvan
s
fortune
was
enormous
and
he
spent
it
entirely
in
doing
good
his
kindheartedness
was
even
greater
than
his
generosity
for
the
one
knew
no
bounds
while
the
other
of
necessity
had
its
limits
as
lord
of
luss
and
laird
of
malcolm
he
represented
his
county
in
the
house
of
lords
but
with
his
jacobite
ideas
he
did
not
care
much
for
the
favor
of
the
house
of
hanover
and
he
was
looked
upon
coldly
by
the
state
party
in
england
because
of
the
tenacity
with
which
he
clung
to
the
traditions
of
his
forefathers
and
his
energetic
resistance
to
the
political
encroachments
of
southerners
and
yet
he
was
not
a
man
behind
the
times
and
there
was
nothing
little
or
about
him
but
while
always
keeping
open
his
ancestral
county
to
progress
he
was
a
true
scotchman
at
heart
and
it
was
for
the
honor
of
scotland
that
he
competed
in
the
yacht
races
of
the
royal
thames
yacht
club
edward
glenarvan
was
years
of
age
he
was
tall
in
person
and
had
rather
stern
features
but
there
was
an
exceeding
sweetness
in
his
look
and
a
stamp
of
highland
poetry
about
his
whole
bearing
he
was
known
to
be
brave
to
excess
and
full
of
daring
and
chivalry
a
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
his
goodness
excelled
every
other
quality
and
he
was
more
charitable
than
martin
himself
for
he
would
have
given
the
whole
of
his
cloak
to
any
of
the
poor
highlanders
he
had
scarcely
been
married
three
months
and
his
bride
was
miss
helena
tuffnell
the
daughter
of
william
tuffnell
the
great
traveler
one
of
the
many
victims
of
geographical
science
and
of
the
passion
for
discovery
miss
helena
did
not
belong
to
a
noble
family
but
she
was
scotch
and
that
was
better
than
all
nobility
in
the
eyes
of
lord
glenarvan
and
she
was
moreover
a
charming
religious
young
woman
lord
glenarvan
did
not
forget
that
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
a
great
traveler
and
he
thought
it
likely
that
she
would
inherit
her
father
s
predilections
he
had
the
duncan
built
expressly
that
he
might
take
his
bride
to
the
most
beautiful
lands
in
the
world
and
complete
their
honeymoon
by
sailing
up
the
mediterranean
and
through
the
clustering
islands
of
the
archipelago
however
lord
glenarvan
had
gone
now
to
london
the
lives
of
the
shipwrecked
men
were
at
stake
and
lady
helena
was
too
much
concerned
herself
about
them
to
grudge
her
husband
s
temporary
absence
a
telegram
next
day
gave
hope
of
his
speedy
return
but
in
the
evening
a
letter
apprised
her
of
the
difficulties
his
proposition
had
met
with
and
the
morning
after
brought
another
in
which
he
openly
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
with
the
admiralty
lady
helena
began
to
get
anxious
as
the
day
wore
on
in
the
evening
when
she
was
sitting
alone
in
her
room
halbert
the
house
steward
came
in
and
asked
if
she
would
see
a
young
girl
and
boy
that
wanted
to
speak
to
lord
glenarvan
some
of
the
country
people
asked
lady
helena
no
madame
replied
the
steward
i
do
not
know
them
at
all
they
came
by
rail
to
balloch
and
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
to
tell
them
to
come
up
in
a
few
minutes
a
girl
and
boy
were
shown
in
they
were
evidently
brother
and
sister
for
the
resemblance
was
unmistakable
the
girl
was
about
sixteen
years
of
age
her
tired
pretty
face
and
sorrowful
eyes
and
resigned
but
courageous
look
as
well
as
her
neat
though
poor
attire
made
a
favorable
impression
the
boy
she
held
by
the
hand
was
about
twelve
but
his
face
expressed
such
determination
that
he
appeared
quite
his
sister
s
protector
the
girl
seemed
too
shy
to
utter
a
word
at
first
but
lady
helena
quickly
relieved
her
embarrassment
by
saying
with
an
encouraging
smile
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
i
think
no
replied
the
boy
in
a
decided
tone
not
to
you
but
to
lord
excuse
him
ma
am
said
the
girl
with
a
look
at
her
brother
lord
glenarvan
is
not
at
the
castle
just
now
returned
lady
helena
but
i
am
his
wife
and
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
you
are
lady
glenarvan
interrupted
the
girl
i
the
wife
of
lord
glenarvan
of
malcolm
castle
that
put
an
announcement
in
the
times
about
the
shipwreck
of
the
britannia
yes
yes
said
lady
helena
eagerly
and
you
i
am
miss
grant
ma
am
and
this
is
my
miss
grant
miss
grant
exclaimed
lady
helena
drawing
the
young
girl
toward
her
and
taking
both
her
hands
and
kissing
the
boy
s
rosy
cheeks
what
is
it
you
know
ma
am
about
the
shipwreck
tell
me
is
my
father
living
shall
we
ever
see
him
again
oh
tell
me
said
the
girl
earnestly
my
dear
child
replied
lady
helena
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
answer
you
lightly
such
a
question
i
would
not
delude
you
with
vain
oh
tell
me
all
tell
me
all
ma
am
i
m
proof
against
sorrow
i
can
bear
to
hear
my
poor
child
there
is
but
a
faint
hope
but
with
the
help
of
almighty
heaven
it
is
just
possible
you
may
one
day
see
your
father
once
the
girl
burst
into
tears
and
robert
seized
lady
glenarvan
s
hand
and
covered
it
with
kisses
as
soon
as
they
grew
calmer
they
asked
a
complete
string
of
questions
and
lady
helena
recounted
the
whole
story
of
the
document
telling
them
that
their
father
had
been
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
patagonia
and
that
he
and
two
sailors
the
sole
survivors
appeared
to
have
reached
the
shore
and
had
written
an
appeal
for
help
in
three
languages
and
committed
it
to
the
care
of
the
waves
during
the
recital
robert
grant
was
devouring
the
speaker
with
his
eyes
and
hanging
on
her
lips
his
childish
imagination
evidently
retraced
all
the
scenes
of
his
father
s
shipwreck
he
saw
him
on
the
deck
of
the
britannia
and
then
struggling
with
the
billows
then
clinging
to
the
rocks
and
lying
at
length
exhausted
on
the
beach
more
than
once
he
cried
out
oh
papa
my
poor
papa
and
pressed
close
to
his
sister
miss
grant
sat
silent
and
motionless
with
clasped
hands
and
all
she
said
when
the
narration
ended
was
oh
ma
am
the
paper
please
i
have
not
it
now
my
dear
child
replied
lady
helena
you
haven
t
it
no
lord
glenarvan
was
obliged
to
take
it
to
london
for
the
sake
of
your
father
but
i
have
told
you
all
it
contained
word
for
word
and
how
we
managed
to
make
out
the
complete
sense
from
the
fragments
of
words
left
all
except
the
longitude
we
can
do
without
that
said
the
boy
yes
robert
rejoined
lady
helena
smiling
at
the
child
s
decided
tone
and
so
you
see
miss
grant
you
know
the
smallest
details
now
just
as
well
as
i
yes
ma
am
but
i
should
like
to
have
seen
my
father
s
well
perhaps
lord
glenarvan
will
be
back
my
husband
determined
to
lay
the
document
before
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
to
induce
them
to
send
out
a
ship
immediately
in
search
of
captain
is
it
possible
ma
am
exclaimed
the
girl
that
you
have
done
that
for
us
yes
my
dear
miss
grant
and
i
am
expecting
lord
glenarvan
back
every
minute
oh
ma
am
heaven
bless
you
and
lord
glenarvan
said
the
young
girl
fervently
overcome
with
grateful
emotion
my
dear
girl
we
deserve
no
thanks
anyone
in
our
place
would
have
done
the
same
i
only
trust
the
hopes
we
are
leading
you
to
entertain
may
be
realized
but
till
my
husband
returns
you
will
remain
at
the
oh
no
ma
am
i
could
not
abuse
the
sympathy
you
show
to
strangers
dear
child
interrupted
lady
helena
you
and
your
brother
are
not
strangers
in
this
house
and
i
should
like
lord
glenarvan
to
be
able
on
his
arrival
to
tell
the
children
of
captain
grant
himself
what
is
going
to
be
done
to
rescue
their
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
an
invitation
given
with
such
heart
and
miss
grant
and
her
brother
consented
to
stay
till
lord
glenarvan
returned
chapter
iv
lady
glenarvan
s
proposal
lady
helena
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
to
the
children
about
the
fears
lord
glenarvan
had
expressed
in
his
letters
respecting
the
decisions
of
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
with
regard
to
the
document
nor
did
she
mention
the
probable
captivity
of
captain
grant
among
the
indians
of
south
america
why
sadden
the
poor
children
and
damp
their
newly
cherished
hopes
it
would
not
in
the
least
alter
the
actual
state
of
the
case
so
not
a
word
was
said
and
after
answering
all
miss
grant
s
questions
lady
helena
began
to
interrogate
in
her
turn
asking
her
about
her
past
life
and
her
present
circumstances
it
was
a
touching
simple
story
she
heard
in
reply
and
one
which
increased
her
sympathy
for
the
young
girl
mary
and
robert
were
the
captain
s
only
children
harry
grant
lost
his
wife
when
robert
was
born
and
during
his
long
voyages
he
left
his
little
ones
in
charge
of
his
cousin
a
good
old
lady
captain
grant
was
a
fearless
sailor
he
not
only
thoroughly
understood
navigation
but
commerce
also
a
qualification
eminently
useful
to
skippers
in
the
merchant
service
he
lived
in
dundee
in
perthshire
scotland
his
father
a
minister
of
katrine
s
church
had
given
him
a
thorough
education
as
he
believed
that
could
never
hurt
anybody
harry
s
voyages
were
prosperous
from
the
first
and
a
few
years
after
robert
was
born
he
found
himself
possessed
of
a
considerable
fortune
it
was
then
that
he
projected
the
grand
scheme
which
made
him
popular
in
scotland
like
glenarvan
and
a
few
noble
families
in
the
lowlands
he
had
no
heart
for
the
union
with
england
in
his
eyes
the
interests
of
his
country
were
not
identified
with
those
of
the
and
to
give
scope
for
personal
development
he
resolved
to
found
an
immense
scotch
colony
on
one
of
the
ocean
continents
possibly
he
might
have
thought
that
some
day
they
would
achieve
their
independence
as
the
united
states
did
an
example
doubtless
to
be
followed
eventually
by
australia
and
india
but
whatever
might
be
his
secret
motives
such
was
his
dream
of
colonization
but
as
is
easily
understood
the
government
opposed
his
plans
and
put
difficulties
enough
in
his
way
to
have
killed
an
ordinary
man
but
harry
would
not
be
beaten
he
appealed
to
the
patriotism
of
his
countrymen
placed
his
fortune
at
the
service
of
the
cause
built
a
ship
and
manned
it
with
a
picked
crew
and
leaving
his
children
to
the
care
of
his
old
cousin
set
off
to
explore
the
great
islands
of
the
pacific
this
was
in
and
for
twelve
months
or
up
to
may
letters
were
regularly
received
from
him
but
no
tidings
whatever
had
come
since
his
departure
from
callao
in
june
and
the
name
of
the
britannia
never
appeared
in
the
shipping
list
just
at
this
juncture
the
old
cousin
died
and
harry
grant
s
two
children
were
left
alone
in
the
world
mary
grant
was
then
only
fourteen
but
she
resolved
to
face
her
situation
bravely
and
to
devote
herself
entirely
to
her
little
brother
who
was
still
a
mere
child
by
dint
of
close
economy
combined
with
tact
and
prudence
she
managed
to
support
and
educate
him
working
day
and
night
denying
herself
everything
that
she
might
give
him
all
he
needed
watching
over
him
and
caring
for
him
like
a
mother
the
two
children
were
living
in
this
touching
manner
in
dundee
struggling
patiently
and
courageously
with
their
poverty
mary
thought
only
of
her
brother
and
indulged
in
dreams
of
a
prosperous
future
for
him
she
had
long
given
up
all
hope
of
the
britannia
and
was
fully
persuaded
that
her
father
was
dead
what
then
was
her
emotion
when
she
accidentally
saw
the
notice
in
the
times
she
never
hesitated
for
an
instant
as
to
the
course
she
should
adopt
but
determined
to
go
to
dumbartonshire
immediately
to
learn
the
best
and
worst
even
if
she
were
to
be
told
that
her
father
s
lifeless
body
had
been
found
on
a
distant
shore
or
in
the
bottom
of
some
abandoned
ship
it
would
be
a
relief
from
incessant
doubt
and
torturing
suspense
she
told
her
brother
about
the
advertisement
and
the
two
children
started
off
together
that
same
day
for
perth
where
they
took
the
train
and
arrived
in
the
evening
at
malcolm
castle
such
was
mary
grant
s
sorrowful
story
and
she
recounted
it
in
so
simple
and
unaffected
a
manner
that
it
was
evident
she
never
thought
her
conduct
had
been
that
of
a
heroine
through
those
long
trying
years
but
lady
helena
thought
it
for
her
and
more
than
once
she
put
her
arms
round
both
the
children
and
could
not
restrain
her
tears
as
for
robert
he
seemed
to
have
heard
these
particulars
for
the
first
time
all
the
while
his
sister
was
speaking
he
gazed
at
her
with
eyes
only
knowing
now
how
much
she
had
done
and
suffered
for
him
and
as
she
ended
he
flung
himself
on
her
neck
and
exclaimed
oh
mamma
my
dear
little
mamma
it
was
quite
dark
by
this
time
and
lady
helena
made
the
children
go
to
bed
for
she
knew
they
must
be
tired
after
their
journey
they
were
soon
both
sound
asleep
dreaming
of
happy
days
after
they
had
retired
lady
helena
sent
for
major
mcnabbs
and
told
him
the
incidents
of
the
evening
that
mary
grant
must
be
a
brave
girl
said
the
major
i
only
hope
my
husband
will
succeed
for
the
poor
children
s
sake
said
his
cousin
it
would
be
terrible
for
them
if
he
did
he
will
be
sure
to
succeed
or
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
must
have
hearts
harder
than
portland
but
notwithstanding
mcnabbs
s
assurance
lady
helena
passed
the
night
in
great
anxiety
and
could
not
close
her
eyes
mary
grant
and
her
brother
were
up
very
early
next
morning
and
were
walking
about
in
the
courtyard
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
carriage
approaching
it
was
lord
glenarvan
and
almost
immediately
lady
helena
and
the
major
came
out
to
meet
him
lady
helena
flew
toward
her
husband
the
moment
he
alighted
but
he
embraced
her
silently
and
looked
gloomy
and
disappointed
indeed
even
furious
well
edward
she
said
tell
well
helena
dear
those
people
have
no
heart
they
have
refused
yes
they
have
refused
me
a
ship
they
talked
of
the
millions
that
had
been
wasted
in
search
for
franklin
and
declared
the
document
was
obscure
and
unintelligible
and
then
they
said
it
was
two
years
now
since
they
were
cast
away
and
there
was
little
chance
of
finding
them
besides
they
would
have
it
that
the
indians
who
made
them
prisoners
would
have
dragged
them
into
the
interior
and
it
was
impossible
they
said
to
hunt
all
through
patagonia
for
three
men
three
scotchmen
that
the
search
would
be
vain
and
perilous
and
cost
more
lives
than
it
saved
in
short
they
assigned
all
the
reasons
that
people
invent
who
have
made
up
their
minds
to
refuse
the
truth
is
they
remembered
captain
grant
s
projects
and
that
is
the
secret
of
the
whole
affair
so
the
poor
fellow
is
lost
for
my
father
my
poor
father
cried
mary
grant
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
lord
glenarvan
who
exclaimed
in
amazement
your
father
what
is
this
miss
yes
edward
said
lady
helena
this
is
miss
mary
grant
and
her
brother
the
two
children
condemned
to
orphanage
by
the
cruel
admiralty
oh
miss
grant
said
lord
glenarvan
raising
the
young
girl
if
i
had
known
of
your
presence
he
said
no
more
and
there
was
a
painful
silence
in
the
courtyard
broken
only
by
sobs
no
one
spoke
but
the
very
attitude
of
both
servants
and
masters
spoke
their
indignation
at
the
conduct
of
the
english
government
at
last
the
major
said
addressing
lord
glenarvan
then
you
have
no
hope
whatever
none
was
the
reply
very
well
then
exclaimed
little
robert
i
ll
go
and
speak
to
those
people
myself
and
we
ll
see
if
they
he
did
not
complete
his
sentence
for
his
sister
stopped
him
but
his
clenched
fists
showed
his
intentions
were
the
reverse
of
pacific
no
robert
said
mary
grant
we
will
thank
this
noble
lord
and
lady
for
what
they
have
done
for
us
and
never
cease
to
think
of
them
with
gratitude
and
then
we
ll
both
go
mary
said
lady
helena
in
a
tone
of
surprise
go
where
asked
lord
glenarvan
i
am
going
to
throw
myself
at
the
queen
s
feet
and
we
shall
see
if
she
will
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
prayers
of
two
children
who
implore
their
father
s
lord
glenarvan
shook
his
head
not
that
he
doubted
the
kind
heart
of
her
majesty
but
he
knew
mary
would
never
gain
access
to
her
suppliants
but
too
rarely
reach
the
steps
of
a
throne
it
seems
as
if
royal
palaces
had
the
same
inscription
on
their
doors
that
the
english
have
on
their
ships
are
requested
not
to
speak
to
the
man
at
the
lady
glenarvan
understood
what
was
passing
in
her
husband
s
mind
and
she
felt
the
young
girl
s
attempt
would
be
useless
and
only
plunge
the
poor
children
in
deeper
despair
suddenly
a
grand
generous
purpose
fired
her
soul
and
she
called
out
mary
grant
wait
my
child
and
listen
to
what
i
m
going
to
mary
had
just
taken
her
brother
by
the
hand
and
turned
to
go
away
but
she
stepped
back
at
lady
helena
s
bidding
the
young
wife
went
up
to
her
husband
and
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
though
her
voice
was
firm
and
her
face
beamed
with
animation
edward
when
captain
grant
wrote
that
letter
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
he
committed
it
to
the
care
of
god
god
has
sent
it
to
us
to
us
undoubtedly
god
intends
us
to
undertake
the
rescue
of
these
poor
what
do
you
mean
helena
i
mean
this
that
we
ought
to
think
ourselves
fortunate
if
we
can
begin
our
married
life
with
a
good
action
well
you
know
edward
that
to
please
me
you
planned
a
pleasure
trip
but
what
could
give
us
such
genuine
pleasure
or
be
so
useful
as
to
save
those
unfortunate
fellows
cast
off
by
their
country
helena
exclaimed
lord
glenarvan
yes
edward
you
understand
me
the
duncan
is
a
good
strong
ship
she
can
venture
in
the
southern
seas
or
go
round
the
world
if
necessary
let
us
go
edward
let
us
start
off
and
search
for
captain
grant
lord
glenarvan
made
no
reply
to
this
bold
proposition
but
smiled
and
holding
out
his
arms
drew
his
wife
into
a
close
fond
embrace
mary
and
robert
seized
her
hands
and
covered
them
with
kisses
and
the
servants
who
thronged
the
courtyard
and
had
been
witnesses
of
this
touching
scene
shouted
with
one
voice
hurrah
for
the
lady
of
luss
three
cheers
for
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
chapter
v
the
departure
of
the
duncan
we
have
said
already
that
lady
helena
was
a
brave
generous
woman
and
what
she
had
just
done
proved
it
her
husband
had
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
such
a
wife
one
who
could
understand
and
enter
into
all
his
views
the
idea
of
going
to
captain
grant
s
rescue
had
occurred
to
him
in
london
when
his
request
was
refused
and
he
would
have
anticipated
lady
helena
only
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
parting
from
her
but
now
that
she
herself
proposed
to
go
all
hesitation
was
at
an
end
the
servants
of
the
castle
had
hailed
the
project
with
loud
acclamations
for
it
was
to
save
their
brothers
scotchmen
like
themselves
and
lord
glenarvan
cordially
joined
his
cheers
with
theirs
for
the
lady
of
luss
the
departure
once
resolved
upon
there
was
not
an
hour
to
be
lost
a
telegram
was
dispatched
to
john
mangles
the
very
same
day
conveying
lord
glenarvan
s
orders
to
take
the
duncan
immediately
to
glasgow
and
to
make
preparations
for
a
voyage
to
the
southern
seas
and
possibly
round
the
world
for
lady
helena
was
right
in
her
opinion
that
the
yacht
might
safely
attempt
the
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
if
necessary
the
duncan
was
a
steam
yacht
of
the
finest
description
she
was
tons
burden
much
larger
than
any
of
the
first
vessels
that
touched
the
shores
of
the
new
world
for
the
largest
of
the
four
ships
that
sailed
with
columbus
was
only
tons
she
had
two
masts
and
all
the
sails
and
rigging
of
an
ordinary
clipper
which
would
enable
her
to
take
advantage
of
every
favorable
wind
though
her
chief
reliance
was
on
her
mechanical
power
the
engine
which
was
constructed
on
a
new
system
was
a
one
of
power
and
put
in
motion
a
double
screw
this
gave
the
yacht
such
swiftness
that
during
her
trial
trip
in
the
firth
of
clyde
she
made
seventeen
miles
an
hour
a
higher
speed
than
any
vessel
had
yet
attained
no
alterations
were
consequently
needed
in
the
duncan
herself
john
mangles
had
only
to
attend
to
her
interior
arrangements
his
first
care
was
to
enlarge
the
bunkers
to
carry
as
much
coal
as
possible
for
it
is
difficult
to
get
fresh
supplies
he
had
to
do
the
same
with
the
and
managed
so
well
that
he
succeeded
in
laying
in
provisions
enough
for
two
years
there
was
abundance
of
money
at
his
command
and
enough
remained
to
buy
a
cannon
on
a
pivot
carriage
which
he
mounted
on
the
forecastle
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
and
it
is
always
well
to
be
able
to
send
a
good
round
bullet
flying
four
miles
off
john
mangles
understood
his
business
though
he
was
only
the
captain
of
a
pleasure
yacht
he
was
one
of
the
best
skippers
in
glasgow
he
was
thirty
years
of
age
and
his
countenance
expressed
both
courage
and
goodness
if
the
features
were
somewhat
coarse
he
had
been
brought
up
at
the
castle
by
the
glenarvan
family
and
had
turned
out
a
capital
sailor
having
already
given
proof
in
some
of
his
long
voyages
of
his
skill
and
energy
and
when
lord
glenarvan
offered
him
the
command
of
the
duncan
he
accepted
it
with
right
good
will
for
he
loved
the
master
of
malcolm
castle
like
a
brother
and
had
hitherto
vainly
sought
some
opportunity
of
showing
his
devotion
tom
austin
the
mate
was
an
old
sailor
worthy
of
all
confidence
the
crew
consisting
of
men
including
the
captain
and
chief
officer
were
all
from
dumbartonshire
experienced
sailors
and
all
belonging
to
the
glenarvan
estate
in
fact
it
was
a
regular
clan
and
they
did
not
forget
to
carry
with
them
the
traditional
bagpipes
lord
glenarvan
had
in
them
a
band
of
trusty
fellows
skilled
in
their
calling
devoted
to
himself
full
of
courage
and
as
practiced
in
handling
as
in
the
maneuvering
of
a
ship
a
valiant
little
troop
ready
to
follow
him
any
where
even
in
the
most
dangerous
expeditions
when
the
crew
heard
whither
they
were
bound
they
could
not
restrain
their
enthusiasm
and
the
rocks
of
dumbarton
rang
again
with
their
joyous
outbursts
of
cheers
but
while
john
mangles
made
the
stowage
and
provisioning
of
the
yacht
his
chief
business
he
did
not
forget
to
fit
up
the
rooms
of
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
for
a
long
voyage
he
had
also
to
get
cabins
ready
for
the
children
of
captain
grant
as
lady
helena
could
not
refuse
mary
s
request
to
accompany
her
as
for
young
robert
he
would
have
smuggled
himself
in
somewhere
in
the
hold
of
the
duncan
rather
than
be
left
behind
he
would
willingly
have
gone
as
like
nelson
it
was
impossible
to
resist
a
little
fellow
like
that
and
indeed
no
one
tried
he
would
not
even
go
as
a
passenger
but
must
serve
in
some
capacity
as
apprentice
or
sailor
he
did
not
care
which
so
he
was
put
in
charge
of
john
mangles
to
be
properly
trained
for
his
vocation
and
i
hope
he
won
t
spare
me
the
if
i
don
t
do
properly
said
robert
rest
easy
on
that
score
my
boy
said
lord
glenarvan
gravely
he
did
not
add
that
this
mode
of
punishment
was
forbidden
on
board
the
duncan
and
moreover
was
quite
unnecessary
to
complete
the
roll
of
passengers
we
must
name
major
mcnabbs
the
major
was
about
fifty
years
of
age
with
a
calm
face
and
regular
features
a
man
who
did
whatever
he
was
told
of
an
excellent
indeed
a
perfect
temper
modest
silent
peaceable
and
amiable
agreeing
with
everybody
on
every
subject
never
discussing
never
disputing
never
getting
angry
he
wouldn
t
move
a
step
quicker
or
slower
whether
he
walked
upstairs
to
bed
or
mounted
a
breach
nothing
could
excite
him
nothing
could
disturb
him
not
even
a
cannon
ball
and
no
doubt
he
will
die
without
ever
having
known
even
a
passing
feeling
of
irritation
this
man
was
endowed
in
an
eminent
degree
not
only
with
ordinary
animal
courage
that
physical
bravery
of
the
which
is
solely
due
to
muscular
energy
but
he
had
what
is
far
nobler
moral
courage
firmness
of
soul
if
he
had
any
fault
it
was
his
being
so
intensely
scotch
from
top
to
toe
a
caledonian
of
the
caledonians
an
obstinate
stickler
for
all
the
ancient
customs
of
his
country
this
was
the
reason
he
would
never
serve
in
england
and
he
gained
his
rank
of
major
in
the
regiment
the
highland
black
watch
composed
entirely
of
scotch
noblemen
as
a
cousin
of
glenarvan
he
lived
in
malcolm
castle
and
as
a
major
he
went
as
a
matter
of
course
with
the
duncan
such
then
was
the
personnel
of
this
yacht
so
unexpectedly
called
to
make
one
of
the
most
wonderful
voyages
of
modern
times
from
the
hour
she
reached
the
steamboat
quay
at
glasgow
she
completely
monopolized
the
public
attention
a
considerable
crowd
visited
her
every
day
and
the
duncan
was
the
one
topic
of
interest
and
conversation
to
the
great
vexation
of
the
different
captains
in
the
port
among
others
of
captain
burton
in
command
of
the
scotia
a
magnificent
steamer
lying
close
beside
her
and
bound
for
calcutta
considering
her
size
the
scotia
might
justly
look
upon
the
duncan
as
a
mere
and
yet
this
pleasure
yacht
of
lord
glenarvan
was
quite
the
center
of
attraction
and
the
excitement
about
her
daily
increased
the
duncan
was
to
sail
out
with
the
tide
at
three
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
but
before
starting
a
touching
ceremony
was
witnessed
by
the
good
people
of
glasgow
at
eight
o
clock
the
night
before
lord
glenarvan
and
his
friends
and
the
entire
crew
from
the
stokers
to
the
captain
all
who
were
to
take
part
in
this
voyage
left
the
yacht
and
repaired
to
mungo
s
the
ancient
cathedral
of
the
city
this
venerable
edifice
so
marvelously
described
by
walter
scott
remains
intact
amid
the
ruins
made
by
the
reformation
and
it
was
there
beneath
its
lofty
arches
in
the
grand
nave
in
the
presence
of
an
immense
crowd
and
surrounded
by
tombs
as
thickly
set
as
in
a
cemetery
that
they
all
assembled
to
implore
the
blessing
of
heaven
on
their
expedition
and
to
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
providence
the
rev
morton
conducted
the
service
and
when
he
had
ended
and
pronounced
the
benediction
a
young
girl
s
voice
broke
the
solemn
silence
that
followed
it
was
mary
grant
who
poured
out
her
heart
to
god
in
prayer
for
her
benefactors
while
grateful
happy
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
and
almost
choked
her
utterance
the
vast
assembly
dispersed
under
the
influence
of
deep
emotion
and
at
ten
o
clock
the
passengers
and
crew
returned
on
board
the
vessel
chapter
vi
an
unexpected
passenger
the
ladies
passed
the
whole
of
the
first
day
of
the
voyage
in
their
berths
for
there
was
a
heavy
swell
in
the
sea
and
toward
evening
the
wind
blew
pretty
fresh
and
the
duncan
tossed
and
pitched
considerably
but
the
morning
after
the
wind
changed
and
the
captain
ordered
the
men
to
put
up
the
foresail
and
brigantine
and
foretopsail
which
greatly
lessened
the
rolling
of
the
vessel
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
were
able
to
come
on
deck
at
daybreak
where
they
found
lord
glenarvan
major
mcnabbs
and
the
captain
and
how
do
you
stand
the
sea
miss
mary
said
lord
glenarvan
pretty
well
my
lord
i
am
not
very
much
inconvenienced
by
it
besides
i
shall
get
used
to
and
our
young
robert
oh
as
for
robert
said
the
captain
whenever
he
is
not
poking
about
down
below
in
the
he
is
perched
somewhere
aloft
among
the
rigging
a
youngster
like
that
laughs
at
why
look
at
him
this
very
moment
do
you
see
him
the
captain
pointed
toward
the
foremast
and
sure
enough
there
was
robert
hanging
on
the
yards
of
the
topgallant
mast
a
hundred
feet
above
in
the
air
mary
involuntarily
gave
a
start
but
the
captain
said
oh
don
t
be
afraid
miss
mary
he
is
all
right
take
my
word
for
it
i
ll
have
a
capital
sailor
to
present
to
captain
grant
before
long
for
we
ll
find
the
worthy
captain
depend
upon
heaven
grant
it
john
replied
the
young
girl
my
dear
child
said
lord
glenarvan
there
is
something
so
providential
in
the
whole
affair
that
we
have
every
reason
to
hope
we
are
not
going
we
are
led
we
are
not
searching
we
are
guided
and
then
see
all
the
brave
men
that
have
enlisted
in
the
service
of
the
good
cause
we
shall
not
only
succeed
in
our
enterprise
but
there
will
be
little
difficulty
in
it
i
promised
lady
helena
a
pleasure
trip
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
i
don
t
keep
my
edward
said
his
wife
you
are
the
best
of
not
at
all
was
the
reply
but
i
have
the
best
of
crews
and
the
best
of
ships
you
don
t
admire
the
duncan
i
suppose
miss
mary
on
the
contrary
my
lord
i
do
admire
her
and
i
m
a
connoisseur
in
ships
returned
the
young
girl
indeed
yes
i
have
played
all
my
life
on
my
father
s
ships
he
should
have
made
me
a
sailor
for
i
dare
say
at
a
push
i
could
reef
a
sail
or
plait
a
gasket
easily
do
you
say
so
miss
exclaimed
john
mangles
if
you
talk
like
that
you
and
john
will
be
great
friends
for
he
can
t
think
any
calling
is
equal
to
that
of
a
seaman
he
can
t
fancy
any
other
even
for
a
woman
isn
t
it
true
john
quite
so
said
the
captain
and
yet
your
lordship
i
must
confess
that
miss
grant
is
more
in
her
place
on
the
poop
than
reefing
a
topsail
but
for
all
that
i
am
quite
flattered
by
her
and
especially
when
she
admires
the
duncan
replied
glenarvan
well
really
said
lady
glenarvan
you
are
so
proud
of
your
yacht
that
you
make
me
wish
to
look
all
over
it
and
i
should
like
to
go
down
and
see
how
our
brave
men
are
their
quarters
are
replied
john
they
are
as
comfortable
as
if
they
were
at
and
they
really
are
at
home
my
dear
helena
said
lord
glenarvan
this
yacht
is
a
portion
of
our
old
caledonia
a
fragment
of
dumbartonshire
making
a
voyage
by
special
favor
so
that
in
a
manner
we
are
still
in
our
own
country
the
duncan
is
malcolm
castle
and
the
ocean
is
loch
very
well
dear
edward
do
the
honors
of
the
castle
at
your
service
madam
but
let
me
tell
olbinett
the
steward
of
the
yacht
was
an
excellent
d
and
might
have
been
french
for
his
airs
of
importance
but
for
all
that
he
discharged
his
functions
with
zeal
and
intelligence
olbinett
said
his
master
as
he
appeared
in
answer
to
his
summons
we
are
going
to
have
a
turn
before
breakfast
i
hope
we
shall
find
it
ready
when
we
come
he
said
this
just
as
if
it
had
been
a
walk
to
tarbert
or
loch
katrine
they
were
going
and
the
steward
bowed
with
perfect
gravity
in
reply
are
you
coming
with
us
major
asked
lady
helena
if
you
command
me
replied
mcnabbs
oh
said
lord
glenarvan
the
major
is
absorbed
in
his
cigar
you
mustn
t
tear
him
from
it
he
is
an
inveterate
smoker
miss
mary
i
can
tell
you
he
is
always
smoking
even
while
he
the
major
gave
an
assenting
nod
and
lord
glenarvan
and
his
party
went
below
mcnabbs
remained
alone
talking
to
himself
as
was
his
habit
and
was
soon
enveloped
in
still
thicker
clouds
of
smoke
he
stood
motionless
watching
the
track
of
the
yacht
after
some
minutes
of
this
silent
contemplation
he
turned
round
and
suddenly
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
new
comer
certainly
if
any
thing
could
have
surprised
him
this
rencontre
would
for
he
had
never
seen
the
stranger
in
his
life
before
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
about
forty
years
of
age
and
resembled
a
long
nail
with
a
big
head
his
head
was
large
and
massive
his
forehead
high
his
chin
very
marked
his
eyes
were
concealed
by
enormous
round
spectacles
and
in
his
look
was
that
peculiar
indecision
which
is
common
to
nyctalopes
or
people
who
have
a
peculiar
construction
of
the
eye
which
makes
the
sight
imperfect
in
the
day
and
better
at
night
it
was
evident
from
his
physiognomy
that
he
was
a
lively
intelligent
man
he
had
not
the
crabbed
expression
of
those
grave
individuals
who
never
laugh
on
principle
and
cover
their
emptiness
with
a
mask
of
seriousness
he
looked
far
from
that
his
careless
air
and
easy
unceremonious
manners
showed
plainly
that
he
knew
how
to
take
men
and
things
on
their
bright
side
but
though
he
had
not
yet
opened
his
mouth
he
gave
one
the
impression
of
being
a
great
talker
and
moreover
one
of
those
absent
folks
who
neither
see
though
they
are
looking
nor
hear
though
they
are
listening
he
wore
a
traveling
cap
and
strong
low
yellow
boots
with
leather
gaiters
his
pantaloons
and
jacket
were
of
brown
velvet
and
their
innumerable
pockets
were
stuffed
with
and
a
thousand
other
things
equally
cumbersome
and
useless
not
to
mention
a
telescope
in
addition
which
he
carried
in
a
the
stranger
s
excitement
was
a
strong
contrast
to
the
major
s
placidity
he
walked
round
mcnabbs
looking
at
him
and
questioning
him
with
his
eyes
without
eliciting
one
remark
from
the
imperturbable
scotchman
or
awakening
his
curiosity
in
the
least
to
know
where
he
came
from
and
where
he
was
going
and
how
he
had
got
on
board
the
duncan
finding
all
his
efforts
baffled
by
the
major
s
indifference
the
mysterious
passenger
seized
his
telescope
drew
it
out
to
its
fullest
extent
about
four
feet
and
began
gazing
at
the
horizon
standing
motionless
with
his
legs
wide
apart
his
examination
lasted
some
few
minutes
and
then
he
lowered
the
glass
set
it
up
on
deck
and
leaned
on
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
of
course
his
weight
shut
up
the
instrument
immediately
by
pushing
the
different
parts
one
into
the
other
and
so
suddenly
that
he
fell
full
length
on
deck
and
lay
sprawling
at
the
foot
of
the
mainmast
any
one
else
but
the
major
would
have
smiled
at
least
at
such
a
ludicrous
sight
but
mcnabbs
never
moved
a
muscle
of
his
face
this
was
too
much
for
the
stranger
and
he
called
out
with
an
unmistakably
foreign
accent
steward
he
waited
a
minute
but
nobody
appeared
and
he
called
again
still
louder
steward
olbinett
chanced
to
be
passing
that
minute
on
his
way
from
the
galley
and
what
was
his
astonishment
at
hearing
himself
addressed
like
this
by
a
lanky
individual
of
whom
he
had
no
knowledge
whatever
where
can
he
have
come
from
who
is
he
he
thought
to
himself
he
can
not
possibly
be
one
of
lord
glenarvan
s
friends
however
he
went
up
on
the
poop
and
approached
the
unknown
personage
who
accosted
him
with
the
inquiry
are
you
the
steward
of
this
vessel
yes
sir
replied
olbinett
but
i
have
not
the
honor
of
i
am
the
passenger
in
cabin
number
number
repeated
the
steward
certainly
and
your
name
what
is
it
well
olbinett
my
friend
we
must
think
of
breakfast
and
that
pretty
quickly
it
is
hours
since
i
have
had
anything
to
eat
or
rather
hours
that
i
have
been
asleep
pardonable
enough
in
a
man
who
came
all
the
way
without
stopping
from
paris
to
glasgow
what
is
the
breakfast
hour
nine
o
clock
replied
olbinett
mechanically
the
stranger
tried
to
pull
out
his
watch
to
see
the
time
but
it
was
not
till
he
had
rummaged
through
the
ninth
pocket
that
he
found
it
ah
well
he
said
it
is
only
eight
o
clock
at
present
fetch
me
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
while
i
am
waiting
for
i
am
actually
falling
through
sheer
olbinett
heard
him
without
understanding
what
he
meant
for
the
voluble
stranger
kept
on
talking
incessantly
flying
from
one
subject
to
another
the
captain
isn
t
the
captain
up
yet
and
the
chief
officer
what
is
he
doing
is
he
asleep
still
it
is
fine
weather
fortunately
and
the
wind
is
favorable
and
the
ship
goes
all
just
at
that
moment
john
mangles
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
here
is
the
captain
said
olbinett
ah
delighted
captain
burton
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
exclaimed
the
unknown
john
mangles
stood
stupefied
as
much
at
seeing
the
stranger
on
board
as
at
hearing
himself
called
captain
but
the
new
comer
went
on
in
the
most
affable
manner
allow
me
to
shake
hands
with
you
sir
and
if
i
did
not
do
so
yesterday
evening
it
was
only
because
i
did
not
wish
to
be
troublesome
when
you
were
starting
but
captain
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
begin
my
intercourse
with
john
mangles
opened
his
eyes
as
wide
as
possible
and
stood
staring
at
olbinett
and
the
stranger
alternately
but
without
waiting
for
a
reply
the
rattling
fellow
continued
now
the
introduction
is
made
my
dear
captain
we
are
old
friends
let
s
have
a
little
talk
and
tell
me
how
you
like
the
scotia
what
do
you
mean
by
the
scotia
put
in
john
mangles
at
last
by
the
scotia
why
the
ship
we
re
on
of
course
a
good
ship
that
has
been
commended
to
me
not
only
for
its
physical
qualities
but
also
for
the
moral
qualities
of
its
commander
the
brave
captain
burton
you
will
be
some
relation
of
the
famous
african
traveler
of
that
name
a
daring
man
he
was
sir
i
offer
you
my
sir
interrupted
john
i
am
not
only
no
relation
of
burton
the
great
traveler
but
i
am
not
even
captain
ah
is
that
so
it
is
burdness
the
chief
officer
that
i
am
talking
to
at
mr
burdness
repeated
john
mangles
beginning
to
suspect
how
the
matter
stood
only
he
asked
himself
whether
the
man
was
mad
or
some
heedless
rattle
pate
he
was
beginning
to
explain
the
case
in
a
categorical
manner
when
lord
glenarvan
and
his
party
came
up
on
the
poop
the
stranger
caught
sight
of
them
directly
and
exclaimed
ah
the
passengers
the
passengers
i
hope
you
are
going
to
introduce
me
to
them
burdness
but
he
could
not
wait
for
any
one
s
intervention
and
going
up
to
them
with
perfect
ease
and
grace
said
bowing
to
miss
grant
madame
then
to
lady
helena
with
another
bow
miss
and
to
lord
glenarvan
here
john
mangles
interrupted
him
and
said
lord
my
lord
continued
the
unknown
i
beg
pardon
for
presenting
myself
to
you
but
at
sea
it
is
well
to
relax
the
strict
rules
of
etiquette
a
little
i
hope
we
shall
soon
become
acquainted
with
each
other
and
that
the
company
of
these
ladies
will
make
our
voyage
in
the
scotia
appear
as
short
as
lady
helena
and
miss
grant
were
too
astonished
to
be
able
to
utter
a
single
word
the
presence
of
this
intruder
on
the
poop
of
the
duncan
was
perfectly
inexplicable
lord
glenarvan
was
more
collected
and
said
sir
to
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
to
jacques
eliacin
francois
marie
paganel
secretary
of
the
geographical
society
of
paris
corresponding
member
of
the
societies
of
berlin
bombay
darmstadt
leipsic
london
petersburg
vienna
and
new
york
honorary
member
of
the
royal
geographical
and
ethnographical
institute
of
the
east
indies
who
after
having
spent
twenty
years
of
his
life
in
geographical
work
in
the
study
wishes
to
see
active
service
and
is
on
his
way
to
india
to
gain
for
the
science
what
information
he
can
by
following
up
the
footsteps
of
great
chapter
vii
jacques
paganel
is
undeceived
the
secretary
of
the
geographical
society
was
evidently
an
amiable
personage
for
all
this
was
said
in
a
most
charming
manner
lord
glenarvan
knew
quite
well
who
he
was
now
for
he
had
often
heard
paganel
spoken
of
and
was
aware
of
his
merits
his
geographical
works
his
papers
on
modern
discoveries
inserted
in
the
reports
of
the
society
and
his
correspondence
gave
him
a
most
distinguished
place
among
the
literati
of
france
lord
glenarvan
could
not
but
welcome
such
a
guest
and
shook
hands
cordially
and
now
that
our
introductions
are
over
he
added
you
will
allow
me
monsieur
paganel
to
ask
you
a
question
twenty
my
lord
replied
paganel
it
will
always
be
a
pleasure
to
converse
with
was
it
last
evening
that
you
came
on
board
this
vessel
yes
my
lord
about
o
clock
i
jumped
into
a
cab
at
the
caledonian
railway
and
from
the
cab
into
the
scotia
where
i
had
booked
my
cabin
before
i
left
paris
it
was
a
dark
night
and
i
saw
no
one
on
board
so
i
found
cabin
no
and
went
to
my
berth
immediately
for
i
had
heard
that
the
best
way
to
prevent
is
to
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
you
start
and
not
to
stir
for
the
first
few
days
and
moreover
i
had
been
traveling
for
thirty
hours
so
i
tucked
myself
in
and
slept
conscientiously
i
assure
you
for
paganel
s
listeners
understood
the
whole
mystery
now
of
his
presence
on
the
duncan
the
french
traveler
had
mistaken
his
vessel
and
gone
on
board
while
the
crew
were
attending
the
service
at
mungo
s
all
was
explained
but
what
would
the
learned
geographer
say
when
he
heard
the
name
and
destination
of
the
ship
in
which
he
had
taken
passage
then
it
is
calcutta
paganel
that
you
have
chosen
as
your
point
of
departure
on
your
travels
yes
my
lord
to
see
india
has
been
a
cherished
purpose
with
me
all
my
life
it
will
be
the
realization
of
my
fondest
dreams
to
find
myself
in
the
country
of
elephants
and
then
it
would
be
by
no
means
a
matter
of
indifference
to
you
to
visit
another
country
no
my
lord
indeed
it
would
be
very
disagreeable
for
i
have
letters
from
lord
somerset
the
and
also
a
commission
to
execute
for
the
geographical
ah
you
have
a
yes
i
have
to
attempt
a
curious
and
important
journey
the
plan
of
which
has
been
drawn
up
by
my
learned
friend
and
colleague
vivien
de
saint
martin
i
am
to
pursue
the
track
of
the
schlaginweit
brothers
and
colonels
waugh
and
webb
and
hodgson
and
huc
and
gabet
the
missionaries
and
moorecroft
and
jules
remy
and
so
many
celebrated
travelers
i
mean
to
try
and
succeed
where
krick
the
missionary
so
unfortunately
failed
in
in
a
word
i
want
to
follow
the
course
of
the
river
which
waters
thibet
for
a
distance
of
kilometres
flowing
along
the
northern
base
of
the
himalayas
and
to
find
out
at
last
whether
this
river
does
not
join
itself
to
the
brahmapoutre
in
the
northeast
of
the
gold
medal
my
lord
is
promised
to
the
traveler
who
will
succeed
in
ascertaining
a
fact
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
desiderata
to
the
geography
of
paganel
was
magnificent
he
spoke
with
superb
animation
soaring
away
on
the
wings
of
imagination
it
would
have
been
as
impossible
to
stop
him
as
to
stop
the
rhine
at
the
falls
of
schaffhausen
monsieur
jacques
paganel
said
lord
glenarvan
after
a
brief
pause
that
would
certainly
be
a
grand
achievement
and
you
would
confer
a
great
boon
on
science
but
i
should
not
like
to
allow
you
to
be
laboring
under
a
mistake
any
longer
and
i
must
tell
you
therefore
that
for
the
present
at
least
you
must
give
up
the
pleasure
of
a
visit
to
give
it
up
and
why
because
you
are
turning
your
back
on
the
indian
what
captain
i
am
not
captain
burton
said
john
mangles
but
the
this
vessel
is
not
the
it
would
be
impossible
to
depict
the
astonishment
of
paganel
he
stared
first
at
one
and
then
at
another
in
the
utmost
bewilderment
lord
glenarvan
was
perfectly
grave
and
lady
helena
and
mary
showed
their
sympathy
for
his
vexation
by
their
looks
as
for
john
mangles
he
could
not
suppress
a
smile
but
the
major
appeared
as
unconcerned
as
usual
at
last
the
poor
fellow
shrugged
his
shoulders
pushed
down
his
spectacles
over
his
nose
and
said
you
are
but
just
at
that
very
moment
his
eye
fell
on
the
wheel
of
the
ship
and
he
saw
the
two
words
on
it
duncan
glasgow
the
duncan
the
duncan
he
exclaimed
with
a
cry
of
despair
and
forthwith
rushed
down
the
stairs
and
away
to
his
cabin
as
soon
as
the
unfortunate
savant
had
disappeared
every
one
except
the
major
broke
out
into
such
peals
of
laughter
that
the
sound
reached
the
ears
of
the
sailors
in
the
forecastle
to
mistake
a
railway
or
to
take
the
train
to
edinburgh
when
you
want
to
go
to
dumbarton
might
happen
but
to
mistake
a
ship
and
be
sailing
for
chili
when
you
meant
to
go
to
india
that
is
a
blunder
indeed
however
said
lord
glenarvan
i
am
not
much
astonished
at
it
in
paganel
he
is
quite
famous
for
such
misadventures
one
day
he
published
a
celebrated
map
of
america
and
put
japan
in
it
but
for
all
that
he
is
distinguished
for
his
learning
and
he
is
one
of
the
best
geographers
in
but
what
shall
we
do
with
the
poor
gentleman
said
lady
helena
we
can
t
take
him
with
us
to
why
not
replied
mcnabbs
gravely
we
are
not
responsible
for
his
heedless
mistakes
suppose
he
were
in
a
railway
train
would
they
stop
it
for
him
no
but
he
would
get
out
at
the
first
well
that
is
just
what
he
can
do
here
too
if
he
likes
he
can
disembark
at
the
first
place
where
we
while
they
were
talking
paganel
came
up
again
on
the
poop
looking
very
woebegone
and
crestfallen
he
had
been
making
inquiry
about
his
luggage
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
all
on
board
and
kept
repeating
incessantly
the
unlucky
words
the
duncan
the
duncan
he
could
find
no
others
in
his
vocabulary
he
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
sometimes
stopping
to
examine
the
sails
or
gaze
inquiringly
over
the
wide
ocean
at
the
far
horizon
at
length
he
accosted
lord
glenarvan
once
more
and
said
and
this
duncan
where
is
she
going
to
america
monsieur
paganel
was
the
reply
and
to
what
particular
part
to
to
chili
to
chili
cried
the
unfortunate
geographer
and
my
mission
to
india
but
what
will
de
the
president
of
the
central
commission
say
and
d
avezac
and
cortanbert
and
vivien
de
saint
martin
how
shall
i
show
my
face
at
the
seances
of
the
society
come
monsieur
paganel
don
t
despair
it
can
all
be
managed
you
will
only
have
to
put
up
with
a
little
delay
which
is
relatively
of
not
much
importance
the
will
wait
for
you
still
in
the
mountains
of
thibet
we
shall
soon
put
in
at
madeira
and
you
will
get
a
ship
there
to
take
you
back
to
thanks
my
lord
i
suppose
i
must
resign
myself
to
it
but
people
will
say
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
adventure
and
it
is
only
to
me
such
things
happen
and
then
too
there
is
a
cabin
taken
for
me
on
board
the
oh
as
to
the
scotia
you
ll
have
to
give
that
up
but
the
duncan
is
a
pleasure
yacht
is
it
not
began
paganel
again
after
a
fresh
examination
of
the
vessel
yes
sir
said
john
mangles
and
belongs
to
lord
who
begs
you
will
draw
freely
on
his
hospitality
said
lord
glenarvan
a
thousand
thanks
my
lord
i
deeply
feel
your
courtesy
but
allow
me
to
make
one
observation
india
is
a
fine
country
and
can
offer
many
a
surprising
marvel
to
travelers
these
ladies
i
suppose
have
never
seen
it
well
now
the
man
at
the
helm
has
only
to
give
a
turn
at
the
wheel
and
the
duncan
will
sail
as
easily
to
calcutta
as
to
concepcion
and
since
it
is
only
a
pleasure
trip
that
you
are
his
proposal
was
met
by
such
grave
disapproving
shakes
of
the
head
that
he
stopped
short
before
the
sentence
was
completed
and
lady
helena
said
monsieur
paganel
if
we
were
only
on
a
pleasure
trip
i
should
reply
let
us
all
go
to
india
together
and
i
am
sure
lord
glenarvan
would
not
object
but
the
duncan
is
going
to
bring
back
shipwrecked
mariners
who
were
cast
away
on
the
shores
of
patagonia
and
we
could
not
alter
such
a
the
frenchman
was
soon
put
in
possession
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
he
was
no
unmoved
auditor
and
when
he
heard
of
lady
helena
s
generous
proposition
he
could
not
help
saying
madame
permit
me
to
express
my
admiration
of
your
conduct
throughout
my
unreserved
admiration
let
your
yacht
continue
her
course
i
should
reproach
myself
were
i
to
cause
a
single
day
s
will
you
join
us
in
our
search
then
asked
lady
helena
it
is
impossible
madame
i
must
fulfill
my
mission
i
shall
disembark
at
the
first
place
you
touch
at
wherever
it
may
that
will
be
madeira
said
john
mangles
madeira
be
it
then
i
shall
only
be
leagues
from
lisbon
and
i
shall
wait
there
for
some
means
of
very
well
monsieur
paganel
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
and
for
my
own
part
i
am
very
glad
to
be
able
to
offer
you
meantime
a
few
days
hospitality
i
only
hope
you
will
not
find
our
company
too
oh
my
lord
exclaimed
paganel
i
am
but
too
happy
to
have
made
a
mistake
which
has
turned
out
so
agreeably
still
it
is
a
very
ridiculous
plight
for
a
man
to
be
in
to
find
himself
sailing
to
america
when
he
set
out
to
go
to
the
east
indies
but
in
spite
of
this
melancholy
reflection
the
frenchman
submitted
gracefully
to
the
compulsory
delay
he
made
himself
amiable
and
merry
and
even
diverting
and
enchanted
the
ladies
with
his
good
humor
before
the
end
of
the
day
he
was
friends
with
everybody
at
his
request
the
famous
document
was
brought
out
he
studied
it
carefully
and
minutely
for
a
long
time
and
finally
declared
his
opinion
that
no
other
interpretation
of
it
was
possible
mary
grant
and
her
brother
inspired
him
with
the
most
lively
interest
he
gave
them
great
hope
indeed
the
young
girl
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
sanguine
prediction
of
success
and
this
odd
way
of
foreseeing
future
events
but
for
his
mission
he
would
have
made
one
of
the
search
party
for
captain
grant
undoubtedly
as
for
lady
helena
when
he
heard
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
william
tuffnell
there
was
a
perfect
explosion
of
admiring
epithets
he
had
known
her
father
and
what
letters
had
passed
between
them
when
william
tuffnell
was
a
corresponding
member
of
the
society
it
was
he
himself
that
had
introduced
him
and
malte
brun
what
a
this
was
and
what
a
pleasure
to
travel
with
the
daughter
of
tuffnell
he
wound
up
by
asking
permission
to
kiss
her
which
lady
helena
granted
though
it
was
perhaps
a
little

viii
the
geographer
s
resolution
meantime
the
yacht
favored
by
the
currents
from
the
north
of
africa
was
making
rapid
progress
toward
the
equator
on
the
of
august
they
sighted
the
madeira
group
of
islands
and
glenarvan
true
to
his
promise
offered
to
put
in
there
and
land
his
new
guest
but
paganel
said
my
dear
lord
i
won
t
stand
on
ceremony
with
you
tell
me
did
you
intend
to
stop
at
madeira
before
i
came
on
board
no
replied
glenarvan
well
then
allow
me
to
profit
by
my
unlucky
mistake
madeira
is
an
island
too
well
known
to
be
of
much
interest
now
to
a
geographer
every
thing
about
this
group
has
been
said
and
written
already
besides
it
is
completely
going
down
as
far
as
wine
growing
is
concerned
just
imagine
no
vines
to
speak
of
being
in
madeira
in
pipes
of
wine
were
made
there
and
in
the
number
fell
to
it
is
a
grievous
spectacle
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
we
might
go
on
to
the
canary
isles
certainly
it
will
not
the
least
interfere
with
our
i
know
it
will
not
my
dear
lord
in
the
canary
islands
you
see
there
are
three
groups
to
study
besides
the
peak
of
teneriffe
which
i
always
wished
to
visit
this
is
an
opportunity
and
i
should
like
to
avail
myself
of
it
and
make
the
ascent
of
the
famous
mountain
while
i
am
waiting
for
a
ship
to
take
me
back
to
as
you
please
my
dear
paganel
said
lord
glenarvan
though
he
could
not
help
smiling
and
no
wonder
for
these
islands
are
scarcely
miles
from
madeira
a
trifling
distance
for
such
a
quick
sailer
as
the
duncan
next
day
about
john
mangles
and
paganel
were
walking
on
the
poop
the
frenchman
was
assailing
his
companion
with
all
sorts
of
questions
about
chili
when
all
at
once
the
captain
interrupted
him
and
pointing
toward
the
southern
horizon
said
monsieur
paganel
yes
my
dear
be
so
good
as
to
look
in
this
direction
don
t
you
see
anything
you
re
not
looking
in
the
right
place
it
is
not
on
the
horizon
but
above
it
in
the
in
the
clouds
i
might
well
not
there
there
by
the
upper
end
of
the
i
see
then
you
don
t
want
to
see
anyway
though
we
are
forty
miles
off
yet
i
tell
you
the
peak
of
teneriffe
is
quite
visible
yonder
above
the
but
whether
paganel
could
not
or
would
not
see
it
then
two
hours
later
he
was
forced
to
yield
to
ocular
evidence
or
own
himself
blind
you
do
see
it
at
last
then
said
john
mangles
yes
yes
distinctly
replied
paganel
adding
in
a
disdainful
tone
and
that
s
what
they
call
the
peak
of
teneriffe
that
s
the
it
doesn
t
look
much
of
a
it
is
feet
though
above
the
level
of
the
that
is
not
equal
to
mont
likely
enough
but
when
you
come
to
ascend
it
probably
you
ll
think
it
high
oh
ascend
it
ascend
it
my
dear
captain
what
would
be
the
good
after
humboldt
and
bonplan
that
humboldt
was
a
great
genius
he
made
the
ascent
of
this
mountain
and
has
given
a
description
of
it
which
leaves
nothing
unsaid
he
tells
us
that
it
comprises
five
different
zones
the
zone
of
the
vines
the
zone
of
the
laurels
the
zone
of
the
pines
the
zone
of
the
alpine
heaths
and
lastly
the
zone
of
sterility
he
set
his
foot
on
the
very
summit
and
found
that
there
was
not
even
room
enough
to
sit
down
the
view
from
the
summit
was
very
extensive
stretching
over
an
area
equal
to
spain
then
he
went
right
down
into
the
volcano
and
examined
the
extinct
crater
what
could
i
do
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
after
that
great
man
well
certainly
there
isn
t
much
left
to
glean
that
is
vexing
too
for
you
would
find
it
dull
work
waiting
for
a
vessel
in
the
peak
of
but
i
say
mangles
my
dear
fellow
are
there
no
ports
in
the
cape
verde
islands
that
we
might
touch
at
oh
yes
nothing
would
be
easier
than
putting
you
off
at
villa
and
then
i
should
have
one
advantage
which
is
by
no
means
inconsiderable
i
should
find
at
senegal
and
that
is
not
far
away
from
those
islands
i
am
quite
aware
that
the
group
is
said
to
be
devoid
of
much
interest
and
wild
and
unhealthy
but
everything
is
curious
in
the
eyes
of
a
geographer
seeing
is
a
science
there
are
people
who
do
not
know
how
to
use
their
eyes
and
who
travel
about
with
as
much
intelligence
as
a
but
that
s
not
in
my
line
i
assure
please
yourself
monsieur
paganel
i
have
no
doubt
geographical
science
will
be
a
gainer
by
your
sojourn
in
the
cape
verde
islands
we
must
go
in
there
anyhow
for
coal
so
your
disembarkation
will
not
occasion
the
least
the
captain
gave
immediate
orders
for
the
yacht
to
continue
her
route
steering
to
the
west
of
the
canary
group
and
leaving
teneriffe
on
her
larboard
she
made
rapid
progress
and
passed
the
tropic
of
cancer
on
the
second
of
september
at
the
weather
now
began
to
change
and
the
atmosphere
became
damp
and
heavy
it
was
the
rainy
season
tempo
das
as
the
spanish
call
it
a
trying
season
to
travelers
but
useful
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
african
islands
who
lack
trees
and
consequently
water
the
rough
weather
prevented
the
passengers
from
going
on
deck
but
did
not
make
the
conversation
any
less
animated
in
the
saloon
on
the
of
september
paganel
began
to
collect
his
luggage
to
go
on
shore
the
duncan
was
already
steaming
among
the
islands
she
passed
sal
a
complete
tomb
of
sand
lying
barren
and
desolate
and
went
on
among
the
vast
coral
reefs
and
athwart
the
isle
of
jacques
with
its
long
chain
of
basaltic
mountains
till
she
entered
the
port
of
villa
praya
and
anchored
in
eight
fathoms
of
water
before
the
town
the
weather
was
frightful
and
the
surf
excessively
violent
though
the
bay
was
sheltered
from
the
sea
winds
the
rain
fell
in
such
torrents
that
the
town
was
scarcely
visible
through
it
it
rose
on
a
plain
in
the
form
of
a
terrace
buttressed
on
volcanic
rocks
three
hundred
feet
high
the
appearance
of
the
island
through
the
thick
veil
of
rain
was
mournful
in
the
extreme
lady
helena
could
not
go
on
shore
as
she
had
purposed
indeed
even
coaling
was
a
difficult
business
and
the
passengers
had
to
content
themselves
below
the
poop
as
best
they
might
naturally
enough
the
main
topic
of
conversation
was
the
weather
everybody
had
something
to
say
about
it
except
the
major
who
surveyed
the
universal
deluge
with
the
utmost
indifference
paganel
walked
up
and
down
shaking
his
head
it
is
clear
enough
paganel
said
lord
glenarvan
that
the
elements
are
against
i
ll
be
even
with
them
for
all
that
replied
the
frenchman
you
could
not
face
rain
like
that
monsieur
paganel
said
lady
helena
oh
quite
well
madam
as
far
as
i
myself
am
concerned
it
is
for
my
luggage
and
instruments
that
i
am
afraid
everything
will
be
the
disembarking
is
the
worst
part
of
the
business
once
at
villa
praya
you
might
manage
to
find
pretty
good
quarters
they
wouldn
t
be
over
clean
and
you
might
find
the
monkeys
and
pigs
not
always
the
most
agreeable
companions
but
travelers
are
not
too
particular
and
moreover
in
seven
or
eight
months
you
would
get
a
ship
i
dare
say
to
take
you
back
to
seven
or
eight
months
exclaimed
paganel
at
least
the
cape
verde
islands
are
not
much
frequented
by
ships
during
the
rainy
season
but
you
can
employ
your
time
usefully
this
archipelago
is
still
but
little
you
can
go
up
the
large
rivers
suggested
lady
helena
there
are
none
well
then
the
small
there
are
none
the
running
brooks
there
are
no
brooks
you
can
console
yourself
with
the
forests
if
that
s
the
case
put
in
the
major
you
can
t
make
forests
without
trees
and
there
are
no
a
charming
country
said
the
major
comfort
yourself
my
dear
paganel
you
ll
have
the
mountains
at
any
rate
said
glenarvan
oh
they
are
neither
lofty
nor
interesting
my
lord
and
beside
they
have
been
described
already
said
lord
glenarvan
yes
that
is
always
my
luck
at
the
canary
islands
i
saw
myself
anticipated
by
humboldt
and
here
by
charles
deville
a
impossible
it
is
too
true
replied
paganel
in
a
doleful
voice
monsieur
deville
was
on
board
the
government
corvette
la
decidee
when
she
touched
at
the
cape
verde
islands
and
he
explored
the
most
interesting
of
the
group
and
went
to
the
top
of
the
volcano
in
isle
fogo
what
is
left
for
me
to
do
after
him
it
is
really
a
great
pity
said
helena
what
will
become
of
you
monsieur
paganel
paganel
remained
silent
you
would
certainly
have
done
much
better
to
have
landed
at
madeira
even
though
there
had
been
no
wine
said
glenarvan
still
the
learned
secretary
was
silent
i
should
wait
said
the
major
just
as
if
he
had
said
i
should
not
paganel
spoke
again
at
length
and
said
my
dear
glenarvan
where
do
you
mean
to
touch
next
at
plague
it
that
is
a
long
way
out
of
the
road
to
not
it
from
the
moment
you
pass
cape
horn
you
are
getting
nearer
to
i
doubt
it
beside
resumed
lord
glenarvan
with
perfect
gravity
when
people
are
going
to
the
indies
it
doesn
t
matter
much
whether
it
is
to
the
east
or
what
it
does
not
matter
much
without
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
pampas
in
patagonia
are
as
much
indians
as
the
natives
of
the
well
done
my
lord
that
s
a
reason
that
would
never
have
entered
my
head
and
then
my
dear
paganel
you
can
gain
the
gold
medal
anyway
there
is
as
much
to
be
done
and
sought
and
investigated
and
discovered
in
the
cordilleras
as
in
the
mountains
of
but
the
course
of
the
what
about
that
go
up
the
rio
colorado
instead
it
is
a
river
but
little
known
and
its
course
on
the
map
is
marked
out
too
much
according
to
the
fancy
of
i
know
it
is
my
dear
lord
they
have
made
grave
mistakes
oh
i
make
no
question
that
the
geographical
society
would
have
sent
me
to
patagonia
as
soon
as
to
india
if
i
had
sent
in
a
request
to
that
effect
but
i
never
thought
of
just
like
come
monsieur
paganel
will
you
go
with
us
asked
lady
helena
in
her
most
winning
tone
madam
my
mission
we
shall
pass
through
the
straits
of
magellan
i
must
tell
you
said
lord
glenarvan
my
lord
you
are
a
let
me
add
that
we
shall
visit
port
port
famine
exclaimed
the
frenchman
besieged
on
all
sides
that
famous
port
in
french
annals
think
too
monsieur
paganel
that
by
taking
part
in
our
enterprise
you
will
be
linking
france
with
a
geographer
would
be
of
much
use
to
our
expedition
and
what
can
be
nobler
than
to
bring
science
to
the
service
of
humanity
that
s
well
said
take
my
advice
then
and
yield
to
chance
or
rather
providence
follow
our
example
it
was
providence
that
sent
us
the
document
and
we
set
out
in
consequence
the
same
providence
brought
you
on
board
the
duncan
don
t
leave
shall
i
say
yes
my
good
friends
come
now
tell
me
you
want
me
very
much
to
stay
don
t
you
said
paganel
and
you
re
dying
to
stay
now
aren
t
you
paganel
returned
glenarvan
that
s
about
it
confessed
the
learned
geographer
but
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
chapter
ix
through
the
straits
of
magellan
the
joy
on
board
was
universal
when
paganel
s
resolution
was
made
known
little
robert
flung
himself
on
his
neck
in
such
tumultuous
delight
that
he
nearly
threw
the
worthy
secretary
down
and
made
him
say
rude
i
ll
teach
him
robert
bade
fair
to
be
an
accomplished
gentleman
some
day
for
john
mangles
was
to
make
a
sailor
of
him
and
the
major
was
to
teach
him
and
glenarvan
and
lady
helena
were
to
instil
into
him
courage
and
goodness
and
generosity
while
mary
was
to
inspire
him
with
gratitude
toward
such
instructors
the
duncan
soon
finished
taking
in
coal
and
turned
her
back
on
the
dismal
region
she
fell
in
before
long
with
the
current
from
the
coast
of
brazil
and
on
the
of
september
entered
the
southern
hemisphere
so
far
then
the
voyage
had
been
made
without
difficulty
everybody
was
full
of
hope
for
in
this
search
for
captain
grant
each
day
seemed
to
increase
the
probability
of
finding
him
the
captain
was
among
the
most
confident
on
board
but
his
confidence
mainly
arose
from
the
longing
desire
he
had
to
see
miss
mary
happy
he
was
smitten
with
quite
a
peculiar
interest
for
this
young
girl
and
managed
to
conceal
his
sentiments
so
well
that
everyone
on
board
saw
it
except
himself
and
mary
grant
as
for
the
learned
geographer
he
was
probably
the
happiest
man
in
all
the
southern
hemisphere
he
spent
the
whole
day
in
studying
maps
which
were
spread
out
on
the
saloon
table
to
the
great
annoyance
of
olbinett
who
could
never
get
the
cloth
laid
for
meals
without
disputes
on
the
subject
but
all
the
passengers
took
his
part
except
the
major
who
was
perfectly
indifferent
about
geographical
questions
especially
at
paganel
also
came
across
a
regular
cargo
of
old
books
in
the
chief
officer
s
chest
they
were
in
a
very
damaged
condition
but
among
them
he
raked
out
a
few
spanish
volumes
and
determined
forthwith
to
set
to
work
to
master
the
language
of
cervantes
as
no
one
on
board
understood
it
and
it
would
be
helpful
in
their
search
along
the
chilian
coast
thanks
to
his
taste
for
languages
he
did
not
despair
of
being
able
to
speak
the
language
fluently
when
they
arrived
at
concepcion
he
studied
it
furiously
and
kept
constantly
muttering
heterogeneous
syllables
he
spent
his
leisure
hours
in
teaching
young
robert
and
instructed
him
in
the
history
of
the
country
they
were
so
rapidly
approaching
on
the
of
september
the
yacht
arrived
off
the
straits
of
magellan
and
entered
them
without
delay
this
route
is
generally
preferred
by
steamers
on
their
way
to
the
pacific
ocean
the
exact
length
of
the
straits
is
miles
ships
of
the
largest
tonnage
find
throughout
sufficient
depth
of
water
even
close
to
the
shore
and
there
is
a
good
bottom
everywhere
and
abundance
of
fresh
water
and
rivers
abounding
in
fish
and
forests
in
game
and
plenty
of
safe
and
accessible
harbors
in
fact
a
thousand
things
which
are
lacking
in
strait
lemaire
and
cape
horn
with
its
terrible
rocks
incessantly
visited
by
hurricane
and
tempest
for
the
first
three
or
four
hours
that
is
to
say
for
about
sixty
to
eighty
miles
as
far
as
cape
gregory
the
coast
on
either
side
was
low
and
sandy
jacques
paganel
would
not
lose
a
single
point
of
view
nor
a
single
detail
of
the
straits
it
would
scarcely
take
hours
to
go
through
them
and
the
moving
panorama
on
both
sides
seen
in
all
the
clearness
and
glory
of
the
light
of
a
southern
sun
was
well
worth
the
trouble
of
looking
at
and
admiring
on
the
terra
del
fuego
side
a
few
creatures
were
wandering
about
on
the
rocks
but
on
the
other
side
not
a
solitary
inhabitant
was
visible
paganel
was
so
vexed
at
not
being
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
any
patagonians
that
his
companions
were
quite
amused
at
him
he
would
insist
that
patagonia
without
patagonians
was
not
patagonia
at
all
but
glenarvan
replied
patience
my
worthy
geographer
we
shall
see
the
patagonians
i
am
not
sure
of
but
there
is
such
a
people
anyhow
said
lady
helena
i
doubt
it
much
madam
since
i
don
t
see
but
surely
the
very
name
patagonia
which
means
great
feet
in
spanish
would
not
have
been
given
to
imaginary
oh
the
name
is
nothing
said
paganel
who
was
arguing
simply
for
the
sake
of
arguing
and
besides
to
speak
the
truth
we
are
not
sure
if
that
is
their
what
an
idea
exclaimed
glenarvan
did
you
know
that
major
no
replied
mcnabbs
and
wouldn
t
give
a
scotch
for
the
you
shall
hear
it
however
major
indifferent
though
magellan
called
the
natives
patagonians
the
fuegians
called
them
tiremenen
the
chilians
caucalhues
the
colonists
of
carmen
tehuelches
the
araucans
huiliches
bougainville
gives
them
the
name
of
chauha
and
falkner
that
of
tehuelhets
the
name
they
give
themselves
is
inaken
now
tell
me
then
how
would
you
recognize
them
indeed
is
it
likely
that
a
people
with
so
many
names
has
any
actual
existence
that
s
a
queer
argument
certainly
said
lady
helena
well
let
us
admit
it
said
her
husband
but
our
friend
paganel
must
own
that
even
if
there
are
doubts
about
the
name
of
the
race
there
is
none
about
their
indeed
i
will
never
own
anything
so
outrageous
as
that
replied
paganel
they
are
tall
said
glenarvan
i
don
t
know
are
they
little
then
asked
lady
helena
no
one
can
affirm
that
they
about
the
average
then
said
mcnabbs
i
don
t
know
that
that
s
going
a
little
too
far
said
glenarvan
travelers
who
have
seen
them
tell
travelers
who
have
seen
them
interrupted
paganel
don
t
agree
at
all
in
their
accounts
magellan
said
that
his
head
scarcely
reached
to
their
well
then
that
yes
but
drake
declares
that
the
english
are
taller
than
the
tallest
patagonian
oh
the
english
that
may
be
replied
the
major
disdainfully
but
we
are
talking
of
the
cavendish
assures
us
that
they
are
tall
and
robust
continued
paganel
hawkins
makes
out
they
are
giants
lemaire
and
shouten
declare
that
they
are
eleven
feet
these
are
all
credible
witnesses
said
glenarvan
yes
quite
as
much
as
wood
narborough
and
falkner
who
say
they
are
of
medium
stature
again
byron
giraudais
bougainville
wallis
and
carteret
declared
that
the
patagonians
are
six
feet
six
inches
but
what
is
the
truth
then
among
all
these
contradictions
asked
lady
helena
just
this
madame
the
patagonians
have
short
legs
and
a
large
bust
or
by
way
of
a
joke
we
might
say
that
these
natives
are
six
feet
high
when
they
are
sitting
and
only
five
when
they
are
bravo
my
dear
geographer
said
glenarvan
that
is
very
well
unless
the
race
has
no
existence
that
would
reconcile
all
statements
returned
paganel
but
here
is
one
consolation
at
all
events
the
straits
of
magellan
are
very
magnificent
even
without
just
at
this
moment
the
duncan
was
rounding
the
peninsula
of
brunswick
between
splendid
panoramas
seventy
miles
after
doubling
cape
gregory
she
left
on
her
starboard
the
penitentiary
of
punta
arena
the
church
steeple
and
the
chilian
flag
gleamed
for
an
instant
among
the
trees
and
then
the
strait
wound
on
between
huge
granitic
masses
which
had
an
imposing
effect
mountains
appeared
their
heads
white
with
eternal
snows
and
their
feet
hid
in
immense
forests
toward
the
southwest
mount
tarn
rose
feet
high
night
came
on
after
a
long
lingering
twilight
the
light
insensibly
melting
away
into
soft
shades
these
brilliant
constellations
began
to
bestud
the
sky
and
the
southern
cross
shone
out
there
were
numerous
bays
along
the
shore
easy
of
access
but
the
yacht
did
not
drop
anchor
in
any
she
continued
her
course
fearlessly
through
the
luminous
darkness
presently
ruins
came
in
sight
crumbling
buildings
which
the
night
invested
with
grandeur
the
sad
remains
of
a
deserted
settlement
whose
name
will
be
an
eternal
protest
against
these
fertile
shores
and
forests
full
of
game
the
duncan
was
passing
fort
famine
it
was
in
that
very
spot
that
sarmiento
a
spaniard
came
in
with
four
hundred
emigrants
to
establish
a
colony
he
founded
the
city
of
philip
but
the
extreme
severity
of
winter
decimated
the
inhabitants
and
those
who
had
struggled
through
the
cold
died
subsequently
of
starvation
cavendish
the
corsair
discovered
the
last
survivor
dying
of
hunger
in
the
ruins
after
sailing
along
these
deserted
shores
the
duncan
went
through
a
series
of
narrow
passes
between
forests
of
beech
and
ash
and
birch
and
at
length
doubled
cape
froward
still
bristling
with
the
ice
of
the
last
winter
on
the
other
side
of
the
strait
in
terra
del
fuego
stood
mount
sarmiento
towering
to
a
height
of
feet
an
enormous
accumulation
of
rocks
separated
by
bands
of
cloud
forming
a
sort
of
aerial
archipelago
in
the
sky
it
is
at
cape
froward
that
the
american
continent
actually
terminates
for
cape
horn
is
nothing
but
a
rock
sunk
in
the
sea
in
latitude
degrees
at
cape
momax
the
straits
widened
and
she
was
able
to
get
round
narborough
isles
and
advance
in
a
more
southerly
direction
till
at
length
the
rock
of
cape
pilares
the
extreme
point
of
desolation
island
came
in
sight
hours
after
entering
the
straits
before
her
stem
lay
a
broad
open
sparkling
ocean
which
jacques
paganel
greeted
with
enthusiastic
gestures
feeling
kindred
emotions
with
those
which
stirred
the
bosom
of
ferdinand
de
magellan
himself
when
the
sails
of
his
ship
the
trinidad
first
bent
before
the
breeze
from
the
great
pacific
chapter
x
the
course
decided
a
week
after
they
had
doubled
the
cape
pilares
the
duncan
steamed
into
the
bay
of
talcahuano
a
magnificent
estuary
twelve
miles
long
and
nine
broad
the
weather
was
splendid
from
november
to
march
the
sky
is
always
cloudless
and
a
constant
south
wind
prevails
as
the
coast
is
sheltered
by
the
mountain
range
of
the
andes
in
obedience
to
lord
glenarvan
s
order
john
mangles
had
sailed
as
near
the
archipelago
of
chiloe
as
possible
and
examined
all
the
creeks
and
windings
of
the
coast
hoping
to
discover
some
traces
of
the
shipwreck
a
broken
spar
or
any
fragment
of
the
vessel
would
have
put
them
in
the
right
track
but
nothing
whatever
was
visible
and
the
yacht
continued
her
route
till
she
dropped
anchor
at
the
port
of
talcahuano
days
from
the
time
she
had
sailed
out
of
the
fogs
of
the
clyde
glenarvan
had
a
boat
lowered
immediately
and
went
on
shore
accompanied
by
paganel
the
learned
geographer
gladly
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
of
making
use
of
the
language
he
had
been
studying
so
conscientiously
but
to
his
great
amazement
found
he
could
not
make
himself
understood
by
the
people
it
is
the
accent
i
ve
not
got
he
said
let
us
go
to
the
replied
glenarvan
they
were
informed
on
arriving
there
by
means
of
a
few
english
words
aided
by
expressive
gestures
that
the
british
consul
lived
at
concepcion
an
hour
s
ride
distant
glenarvan
found
no
difficulty
in
procuring
two
fleet
horses
and
he
and
paganel
were
soon
within
the
walls
of
the
great
city
due
to
the
enterprising
genius
of
valdivia
the
valiant
comrade
of
the
pizarros
how
it
was
shorn
of
its
ancient
splendor
often
pillaged
by
the
natives
burned
in
it
lay
in
desolation
and
ruins
its
walls
still
blackened
by
the
flames
scarcely
numbering
inhabitants
and
already
eclipsed
by
talcahuano
the
grass
was
growing
in
the
streets
beneath
the
lazy
feet
of
the
citizens
and
all
trade
and
business
indeed
any
description
of
activity
was
impossible
the
notes
of
the
mandolin
resounded
from
every
balcony
and
languishing
songs
floated
on
the
breeze
concepcion
the
ancient
city
of
brave
men
had
become
a
village
of
women
and
children
lord
glenarvan
felt
no
great
desire
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
this
decay
though
paganel
tried
to
draw
him
into
a
discussion
on
the
subject
he
would
not
delay
an
instant
but
went
straight
on
to
the
house
of
bentic
her
majesty
s
consul
who
received
them
very
courteously
and
on
learning
their
errand
undertook
to
make
inquiries
all
along
the
coast
but
to
the
question
whether
a
vessel
called
the
britannia
had
gone
ashore
either
on
the
chilian
or
araucanian
coast
he
gave
a
decided
negative
no
report
of
such
an
event
had
been
made
to
him
or
any
of
the
other
consuls
glenarvan
however
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
disheartened
he
went
back
to
talcahuano
and
spared
neither
pains
nor
expense
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
whole
seaboard
but
it
was
all
in
vain
the
most
minute
inquiries
were
fruitless
and
lord
glenarvan
returned
to
the
yacht
to
report
his
ill
success
mary
grant
and
her
brother
could
not
restrain
their
grief
lady
helena
did
her
best
to
comfort
them
by
loving
caresses
while
jacques
paganel
took
up
the
document
and
began
studying
it
again
he
had
been
poring
over
it
for
more
than
an
hour
when
glenarvan
interrupted
him
and
said
paganel
i
appeal
to
your
sagacity
have
we
made
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
document
is
there
anything
illogical
about
the
meaning
paganel
was
silent
absorbed
in
reflection
have
we
mistaken
the
place
where
the
catastrophe
occurred
continued
glenarvan
does
not
the
name
patagonia
seem
apparent
even
to
the
least
individual
paganel
was
still
silent
besides
said
glenarvan
does
not
the
word
indien
prove
we
are
right
perfectly
so
replied
mcnabbs
and
is
it
not
evident
then
that
at
the
moment
of
writing
the
words
the
shipwrecked
men
were
expecting
to
be
made
prisoners
by
the
indians
i
take
exception
to
that
my
lord
said
paganel
and
even
if
your
other
conclusions
are
right
this
at
least
seemed
to
me
what
do
you
mean
asked
lady
helena
while
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
geographer
i
mean
this
replied
paganel
that
captain
grant
is
a
prisoner
among
the
and
i
further
add
that
the
document
states
it
explain
yourself
sir
said
mary
grant
nothing
is
plainer
dear
mary
instead
of
reading
the
document
read
and
the
whole
thing
is
but
that
is
impossible
replied
lord
glenarvan
impossible
and
why
my
noble
friend
asked
paganel
smiling
because
the
bottle
could
only
have
been
thrown
into
the
sea
just
when
the
vessel
went
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
and
consequently
the
latitude
and
longitude
given
refer
to
the
actual
place
of
the
there
is
no
proof
of
that
replied
paganel
and
i
see
nothing
to
preclude
the
supposition
that
the
poor
fellows
were
dragged
into
the
interior
by
the
indians
and
sought
to
make
known
the
place
of
their
captivity
by
means
of
this
except
this
fact
my
dear
paganel
that
there
was
no
sea
and
therefore
they
could
not
have
flung
the
bottle
into
unless
they
flung
it
into
rivers
which
ran
into
the
sea
returned
paganel
this
reply
was
so
unexpected
and
yet
so
admissible
that
it
made
them
all
completely
silent
for
a
minute
though
their
beaming
eyes
betrayed
the
rekindling
of
hope
in
their
hearts
lady
helena
was
the
first
to
speak
what
an
idea
she
exclaimed
and
what
a
good
idea
was
paganel
s
naive
rejoinder
to
her
exclamation
what
would
you
advise
then
said
glenarvan
my
advice
is
to
follow
the
parallel
from
the
point
where
it
touches
the
american
continent
to
where
it
dips
into
the
atlantic
without
deviating
from
it
half
a
degree
and
possibly
in
some
part
of
its
course
we
shall
fall
in
with
the
shipwrecked
there
is
a
poor
chance
of
that
said
the
major
poor
as
it
is
returned
paganel
we
ought
not
to
lose
it
if
i
am
right
in
my
conjecture
that
the
bottle
has
been
carried
into
the
sea
on
the
bosom
of
some
river
we
can
not
fail
to
find
the
track
of
the
prisoners
you
can
easily
convince
yourselves
of
this
by
looking
at
this
map
of
the
he
unrolled
a
map
of
chili
and
the
argentine
provinces
as
he
spoke
and
spread
it
out
on
the
table
just
follow
me
for
a
moment
he
said
across
the
american
continent
let
us
make
a
stride
across
the
narrow
strip
of
chili
and
over
the
cordilleras
of
the
andes
and
get
into
the
heart
of
the
pampas
shall
we
find
any
lack
of
rivers
and
streams
and
currents
no
for
here
are
the
rio
negro
and
rio
colorado
and
their
tributaries
intersected
by
the
parallel
and
any
of
them
might
have
carried
the
bottle
on
its
waters
then
perhaps
in
the
midst
of
a
tribe
in
some
indian
settlement
on
the
shores
of
these
almost
unknown
rivers
those
whom
i
may
call
my
friends
await
some
providential
intervention
ought
we
to
disappoint
their
hopes
do
you
not
all
agree
with
me
that
it
is
our
duty
to
go
along
the
line
my
finger
is
pointing
out
at
this
moment
on
the
map
and
if
after
all
we
find
i
have
been
mistaken
still
to
keep
straight
on
and
follow
the
parallel
till
we
find
those
we
seek
if
even
we
go
right
round
the
world
his
generous
enthusiasm
so
touched
his
auditors
that
involuntarily
they
rose
to
their
feet
and
grasped
his
hands
while
robert
exclaimed
as
he
devoured
the
map
with
his
eyes
yes
my
father
is
there
and
where
he
is
replied
glenarvan
we
ll
manage
to
go
my
boy
and
find
him
nothing
can
be
more
logical
than
paganel
s
theory
and
we
must
follow
the
course
he
points
out
without
the
least
hesitation
captain
grant
may
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
numerous
tribe
or
his
captors
may
be
but
a
handful
in
the
latter
case
we
shall
carry
him
off
at
once
but
in
the
event
of
the
former
after
we
have
reconnoitered
the
situation
we
must
go
back
to
the
duncan
on
the
eastern
coast
and
get
to
buenos
ayres
where
we
can
soon
organize
a
detachment
of
men
with
major
mcnabbs
at
their
head
strong
enough
to
tackle
all
the
indians
in
the
argentine
that
s
capital
my
lord
said
john
mangles
and
i
may
add
that
there
is
no
danger
whatever
crossing
the
monsieur
paganel
asked
lady
helena
you
have
no
fear
then
that
if
the
poor
fellows
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
indians
their
lives
at
least
have
been
what
a
question
why
madam
the
indians
are
not
anthropophagi
far
from
it
one
of
my
own
countrymen
guinnard
associated
with
me
in
the
geographical
society
was
three
years
a
prisoner
among
the
indians
in
the
pampas
he
had
to
endure
sufferings
and
but
came
off
victorious
at
last
a
european
is
a
useful
being
in
these
countries
the
indians
know
his
value
and
take
care
of
him
as
if
he
were
some
costly
there
is
not
the
least
room
then
for
hesitation
said
lord
glenarvan
go
we
must
and
as
soon
as
possible
what
route
must
we
take
one
that
is
both
easy
and
agreeable
replied
paganel
rather
mountainous
at
first
and
then
sloping
gently
down
the
eastern
side
of
the
andes
into
a
smooth
plain
turfed
and
graveled
quite
like
a
let
us
see
the
map
said
the
major
here
it
is
my
dear
mcnabbs
we
shall
go
through
the
capital
of
araucania
and
cut
the
cordilleras
by
the
pass
of
antuco
leaving
the
volcano
on
the
south
and
gliding
gently
down
the
mountain
sides
past
the
neuquem
and
the
rio
colorado
on
to
the
pampas
till
we
reach
the
sierra
tapalquen
from
whence
we
shall
see
the
frontier
of
the
province
of
buenos
ayres
these
we
shall
pass
by
and
cross
over
the
sierra
tandil
pursuing
our
search
to
the
very
shores
of
the
atlantic
as
far
as
point
paganel
went
through
this
programme
of
the
expedition
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
map
he
was
so
posted
up
in
the
travels
of
frezier
molina
humboldt
miers
and
orbigny
that
he
had
the
geographical
nomenclature
at
his
fingers
ends
and
could
trust
implicitly
to
his
memory
you
see
then
friend
he
added
that
it
is
a
straight
course
in
thirty
days
we
shall
have
gone
over
it
and
gained
the
eastern
side
before
the
duncan
however
little
she
may
be
delayed
by
the
westerly
then
the
duncan
is
to
cruise
between
corrientes
and
cape
saint
antonie
said
john
mangles
just
and
how
is
the
expedition
to
be
organized
asked
glenarvan
as
simply
as
possible
all
there
is
to
be
done
is
to
reconnoiter
the
situation
of
captain
grant
and
not
to
come
to
gunshot
with
the
indians
i
think
that
lord
glenarvan
our
natural
leader
the
major
who
would
not
yield
his
place
to
anybody
and
your
humble
servant
jacques
and
me
interrupted
robert
robert
robert
exclaimed
mary
and
why
not
returned
paganel
travels
form
the
youthful
mind
yes
robert
we
four
and
three
of
the
and
does
your
lordship
mean
to
pass
me
by
said
john
mangles
addressing
his
master
my
dear
john
replied
glenarvan
we
leave
passengers
on
board
those
dearer
to
us
than
life
and
who
is
to
watch
over
them
but
the
devoted
captain
then
we
can
t
accompany
you
said
lady
helena
while
a
shade
of
sadness
beclouded
her
eyes
my
dear
helena
the
journey
will
so
soon
be
accomplished
that
it
will
be
but
a
brief
separation
and
yes
dear
i
understand
it
is
all
right
and
i
do
hope
you
may
besides
you
can
hardly
call
it
a
journey
added
paganel
what
is
it
then
it
is
just
making
a
flying
passage
across
the
continent
the
way
a
good
man
goes
through
the
world
doing
all
the
good
he
can
that
is
our
this
ended
the
discussion
if
a
conversation
can
be
so
called
where
all
who
take
part
in
it
are
of
the
same
opinion
preparations
commenced
the
same
day
but
as
secretly
as
possible
to
prevent
the
indians
getting
scent
of
it
the
day
of
departure
was
fixed
for
the
of
october
the
sailors
were
all
so
eager
to
join
the
expedition
that
glenarvan
found
the
only
way
to
prevent
jealousy
among
them
was
to
draw
lots
who
should
go
this
was
accordingly
done
and
fortune
favored
the
chief
officer
tom
austin
wilson
a
strong
jovial
young
fellow
and
mulrady
so
good
a
boxer
that
he
might
have
entered
the
lists
with
tom
sayers
himself
glenarvan
displayed
the
greatest
activity
about
the
preparations
for
he
was
anxious
to
be
ready
by
the
appointed
day
john
mangles
was
equally
busy
in
coaling
the
vessel
that
she
might
weigh
anchor
at
the
same
time
there
was
quite
a
rivalry
between
glenarvan
and
the
young
captain
about
getting
first
to
the
argentine
coast
both
were
ready
on
the
the
whole
search
party
assembled
in
the
saloon
to
bid
farewell
to
those
who
remained
behind
the
duncan
was
just
about
to
get
under
way
and
already
the
vibration
of
the
screw
began
to
agitate
the
limpid
waters
of
talcahuano
glenarvan
paganel
mcnabbs
robert
grant
tom
austin
wilson
and
mulrady
stood
armed
with
carbines
and
colt
s
revolvers
guides
and
mules
awaited
them
at
the
landing
stairs
of
the
harbor
it
is
time
said
lord
glenarvan
at
last
go
then
dear
edward
said
lady
helena
restraining
her
emotion
lord
glenarvan
clasped
her
closely
to
his
breast
for
an
instant
and
then
turned
away
while
robert
flung
his
arms
round
mary
s
neck
and
now
friends
said
paganel
let
s
have
one
good
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
all
round
to
last
us
till
we
get
to
the
shores
of
the
this
was
not
much
to
ask
but
he
certainly
got
strong
enough
grips
to
go
some
way
towards
satisfying
his
desire
all
went
on
deck
now
and
the
seven
explorers
left
the
vessel
they
were
soon
on
the
quay
and
as
the
yacht
turned
round
to
pursue
her
course
she
came
so
near
where
they
stood
that
lady
helena
could
exchange
farewells
once
more
god
help
you
she
called
out
heaven
will
help
us
madam
shouted
paganel
in
reply
for
you
may
be
sure
we
ll
help
go
on
sung
out
the
captain
to
his
engineer
at
the
same
moment
lord
glenarvan
gave
the
signal
to
start
and
away
went
the
mules
along
the
coast
while
the
duncan
steamed
out
at
full
speed
toward
the
broad
ocean
chapter
xi
traveling
in
chili
the
native
troops
organized
by
lord
glenarvan
consisted
of
three
men
and
a
boy
the
captain
of
the
muleteers
was
an
englishman
who
had
become
naturalized
through
twenty
years
residence
in
the
country
he
made
a
livelihood
by
letting
out
mules
to
travelers
and
leading
them
over
the
difficult
passes
of
the
cordilleras
after
which
he
gave
them
in
charge
of
a
baqueano
or
argentine
guide
to
whom
the
route
through
the
pampas
was
perfectly
familiar
this
englishman
had
not
so
far
forgotten
his
mother
tongue
among
mules
and
indians
that
he
could
not
converse
with
his
countrymen
and
a
lucky
thing
it
was
for
them
as
lord
glenarvan
found
it
far
easier
to
give
orders
than
to
see
them
executed
paganel
was
still
unsuccessful
in
making
himself
understood
the
catapez
as
he
was
called
in
chilian
had
two
natives
called
peons
and
a
boy
about
twelve
years
of
age
under
him
the
peons
took
care
of
the
baggage
mules
and
the
boy
led
the
madrina
a
young
mare
adorned
with
rattle
and
bells
which
walked
in
front
followed
by
ten
mules
the
travelers
rode
seven
of
these
and
the
catapez
another
the
remaining
two
carried
provisions
and
a
few
bales
of
goods
intended
to
secure
the
goodwill
of
the
caciques
of
the
plain
the
peons
walked
according
to
their
usual
habit
every
arrangement
had
been
made
to
insure
safety
and
speed
for
crossing
the
andes
is
something
more
than
an
ordinary
journey
it
could
not
be
accomplished
without
the
help
of
the
hardy
mules
of
the
argentine
breed
those
reared
in
the
country
are
much
superior
to
their
progenitors
they
are
not
particular
about
their
food
and
only
drink
once
a
day
and
they
can
go
with
ease
ten
leagues
in
eight
hours
there
are
no
inns
along
this
road
from
one
ocean
to
another
the
only
viands
on
which
travelers
can
regale
themselves
are
dried
meat
rice
seasoned
with
pimento
and
such
game
as
may
be
shot
the
torrents
provide
them
with
water
in
the
mountains
and
the
rivulets
in
the
plains
which
they
improve
by
the
addition
of
a
few
drops
of
rum
and
each
man
carries
a
supply
of
this
in
a
bullock
s
horn
called
chiffle
they
have
to
be
careful
however
not
to
indulge
too
freely
in
alcoholic
drinks
as
the
climate
itself
has

peculiarly
exhilarating
effect
on

it

glenarvan
an
experienced
traveler
who
knew
how
to
adapt
himself
to
the
customs
of
other
countries
adopted
the
chilian
costume
for
himself
and
his
whole
party
paganel
and
robert
both
alike
children
though
of
different
growth
were
wild
with
delight
as
they
inserted
their
heads
in
the
national
poncho
an
immense
plaid
with
a
hole
in
center
and
their
legs
in
high
leather
boots
the
mules
were
richly
caparisoned
with
the
arab
bit
in
their
mouths
and
long
reins
of
plaited
leather
which
served
as
a
whip
the
headstall
of
the
bridle
was
decorated
with
metal
ornaments
and
the
alforjas
double
sacks
of
gay
colored
linen
containing
the
day
s
provisions
paganel
distrait
as
usual
was
flung
several
times
before
he
succeeded
in
bestriding
his
good
steed
but
once
in
the
saddle
his
inseparable
telescope
on
his
he
held
on
well
enough
keeping
his
feet
fast
in
the
stirrups
and
trusting
entirely
to
the
sagacity
of
his
beast
as
for
robert
his
first
attempt
at
mounting
was
successful
and
proved
that
he
had
the
making
in
him
of
an
excellent
horseman
the
weather
was
splendid
when
they
started
the
sky
a
deep
cloudless
blue
and
yet
the
atmosphere
so
tempered
by
the
sea
breezes
as
to
prevent
any
feeling
of
oppressive
heat
they
marched
rapidly
along
the
winding
shore
of
the
bay
of
talcahuano
in
order
to
gain
the
extremity
of
the
parallel
thirty
miles
south
no
one
spoke
much
the
first
day
for
the
smoke
of
the
duncan
was
still
visible
on
the
horizon
and
the
pain
of
parting
too
keenly
felt
paganel
talked
to
himself
in
spanish
asking
and
answering
questions
the
catapez
moreover
was
a
taciturn
man
naturally
and
had
not
been
rendered
loquacious
by
his
calling
he
hardly
spoke
to
his
peons
they
understood
their
duties
perfectly
if
one
of
the
mules
stopped
they
urged
it
on
with
a
guttural
cry
and
if
that
proved
unavailing
a
pebble
thrown
with
unerring
aim
soon
cured
the
animal
s
obstinacy
if
a
strap
got
loose
or
a
rein
fell
a
peon
came
forward
instantly
and
throwing
off
his
poncho
flung
it
over
his
beast
s
head
till
the
accident
was
repaired
and
the
march
resumed
the
custom
of
the
muleteers
is
to
start
immediately
after
breakfast
about
eight
o
clock
and
not
to
stop
till
they
camp
for
the
night
about
glenarvan
fell
in
with
the
practice
and
the
first
halt
was
just
as
they
arrived
at
arauco
situated
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
bay
to
find
the
extremity
of
the
degree
of
latitude
they
would
have
required
to
proceed
as
far
as
the
bay
of
carnero
twenty
miles
further
but
the
agents
of
glenarvan
had
already
scoured
that
part
of
the
coast
and
to
repeat
the
exploration
would
have
been
useless
it
was
therefore
decided
that
arauco
should
be
the
point
of
departure
and
they
should
keep
on
from
there
toward
the
east
in
a
straight
line
since
the
weather
was
so
favorable
and
the
whole
party
even
robert
were
in
perfect
health
and
altogether
the
journey
had
commenced
under
such
favorable
auspices
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
push
forward
as
quickly
as
possible
accordingly
the
next
day
they
marched
miles
or
more
and
encamped
at
nightfall
on
the
banks
of
rio
biobio
the
country
still
presented
the
same
fertile
aspect
and
abounded
in
flowers
but
animals
of
any
sort
only
came
in
sight
occasionally
and
there
were
no
birds
visible
except
a
solitary
heron
or
owl
and
a
thrush
or
grebe
flying
from
the
falcon
human
beings
there
were
none
not
a
native
appeared
not
even
one
of
the
guassos
the
degenerate
offspring
of
indians
and
spaniards
dashed
across
the
plain
like
a
shadow
his
flying
steed
dripping
with
blood
from
the
cruel
thrusts
inflicted
by
the
gigantic
spurs
of
his
master
s
naked
feet
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
make
inquiries
when
there
was
no
one
to
address
and
lord
glenarvan
came
to
the
conclusion
that
captain
grant
must
have
been
dragged
right
over
the
andes
into
the
pampas
and
that
it
would
be
useless
to
search
for
him
elsewhere
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
wait
patiently
and
press
forward
with
all
the
speed
in
their
power
on
the
they
set
out
in
the
usual
line
of
march
a
line
which
it
was
hard
work
for
robert
to
keep
his
ardor
constantly
compelled
him
to
get
ahead
of
the
madrina
to
the
great
despair
of
his
mule
nothing
but
a
sharp
recall
from
glenarvan
kept
the
boy
in
proper
order
the
country
now
became
more
diversified
and
the
rising
ground
indicated
their
approach
to
a
mountainous
district
rivers
were
more
numerous
and
came
rushing
noisily
down
the
slopes
paganel
consulted
his
maps
and
when
he
found
any
of
those
streams
not
marked
which
often
happened
all
the
fire
of
a
geographer
burned
in
his
veins
and
he
would
exclaim
with
a
charming
air
of
vexation
a
river
which
hasn
t
a
name
is
like
having
no
civil
standing
it
has
no
existence
in
the
eye
of
geographical
he
christened
them
forthwith
without
the
least
hesitation
and
marked
them
down
on
the
map
qualifying
them
with
the
most
adjectives
he
could
find
in
the
spanish
language
what
a
language
he
said
how
full
and
sonorous
it
is
it
is
like
the
metal
church
bells
are
made
of
composed
of
parts
of
copper
and
of
but
i
say
do
you
make
any
progress
in
it
asked
glenarvan
most
certainly
my
dear
lord
ah
if
it
wasn
t
the
accent
that
wretched
accent
and
for
want
of
better
work
paganel
whiled
away
the
time
along
the
road
by
practising
the
difficulties
in
pronunciation
repeating
all
the
words
he
could
though
still
making
geographical
observations
any
question
about
the
country
that
glenarvan
might
ask
the
catapez
was
sure
to
be
answered
by
the
learned
frenchman
before
he
could
reply
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
guide
who
gazed
at
him
in
bewilderment
about
two
o
clock
that
same
day
they
came
to
a
cross
road
and
naturally
enough
glenarvan
inquired
the
name
of
it
it
is
the
route
from
yumbel
to
los
angeles
said
paganel
glenarvan
looked
at
the
catapez
who
replied
quite
and
then
turning
toward
the
geographer
he
added
you
have
traveled
in
these
parts
before
sir
oh
yes
said
paganel
quite
gravely
on
a
mule
no
in
an
easy
the
catapez
could
not
make
him
out
but
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
resumed
his
post
at
the
head
of
the
party
at
five
in
the
evening
they
stopped
in
a
gorge
of
no
great
depth
some
miles
above
the
little
town
of
loja
and
encamped
for
the
night
at
the
foot
of
the
sierras
the
first
steppes
of
the
great
cordilleras
chapter
xii
eleven
thousand
feet
aloft
nothing
of
importance
had
occurred
hitherto
in
the
passage
through
chili
but
all
the
obstacles
and
difficulties
incident
to
a
mountain
journey
were
about
to
crowd
on
the
travelers
now
one
important
question
had
first
to
be
settled
which
pass
would
take
them
over
the
andes
and
yet
not
be
out
of
their
fixed
route
on
questioning
the
catapez
on
the
subject
he
replied
there
are
only
two
practicable
passes
that
i
know
of
in
this
part
of
the
the
pass
of
arica
is
one
undoubtedly
discovered
by
valdivia
mendoze
said
paganel
just
and
that
of
villarica
is
the
well
my
good
fellow
both
these
passes
have
only
one
fault
they
take
us
too
far
out
of
our
route
either
north
or
have
you
no
other
to
propose
asked
the
major
certainly
replied
paganel
there
is
the
pass
of
antuco
on
the
slope
of
the
volcano
in
latitude
degrees
or
in
other
words
only
half
a
degree
out
of
our
that
would
do
but
are
you
acquainted
with
this
pass
of
antuco
catapez
said
glenarvan
yes
your
lordship
i
have
been
through
it
but
i
did
not
mention
it
as
no
one
goes
that
way
but
the
indian
shepherds
with
the
herds
of
oh
very
well
if
mares
and
sheep
and
oxen
can
go
that
way
we
can
so
let
s
start
at
the
signal
for
departure
was
given
immediately
and
they
struck
into
the
heart
of
the
valley
of
las
lejas
between
great
masses
of
chalk
crystal
from
this
point
the
pass
began
to
be
difficult
and
even
dangerous
the
angles
of
the
declivities
widened
and
the
ledges
narrowed
and
frightful
precipices
met
their
gaze
the
mules
went
cautiously
along
keeping
their
heads
near
the
ground
as
if
scenting
the
track
they
marched
in
file
sometimes
at
a
sudden
bend
of
the
road
the
madrina
would
disappear
and
the
little
caravan
had
to
guide
themselves
by
the
distant
tinkle
of
her
bell
often
some
capricious
winding
would
bring
the
column
in
two
parallel
lines
and
the
catapez
could
speak
to
his
peons
across
a
crevasse
not
two
fathoms
wide
though
two
hundred
deep
which
made
between
them
an
inseparable
gulf
glenarvan
followed
his
guide
step
by
step
he
saw
that
his
perplexity
was
increasing
as
the
way
became
more
difficult
but
did
not
dare
to
interrogate
him
rightly
enough
perhaps
thinking
that
both
mules
and
muleteers
were
very
much
governed
by
instinct
and
it
was
best
to
trust
to
them
for
about
an
hour
longer
the
catapez
kept
wandering
about
almost
at
haphazard
though
always
getting
higher
up
the
mountains
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
stop
short
they
were
in
a
narrow
valley
one
of
those
gorges
called
by
the
indians
quebrads
and
on
reaching
the
end
a
wall
of
porphyry
rose
perpendicularly
before
them
and
barred
further
passage
the
catapez
after
vain
attempts
at
finding
an
opening
dismounted
crossed
his
arms
and
waited
glenarvan
went
up
to
him
and
asked
if
he
had
lost
his
way
no
your
lordship
was
the
reply
but
you
are
not
in
the
pass
of
we
you
are
sure
you
are
not
mistaken
i
am
not
mistaken
see
there
are
the
remains
of
a
fire
left
by
the
indians
and
there
are
the
marks
of
the
mares
and
the
they
must
have
gone
on
yes
but
no
more
will
go
the
last
earthquake
has
made
the
route
to
mules
said
the
major
but
not
to
ah
that
s
your
concern
i
have
done
all
i
could
my
mules
and
myself
are
at
your
service
to
try
the
other
passes
of
the
and
that
would
delay
us
three
days
at
glenarvan
listened
silently
he
saw
the
catapez
was
right
his
mules
could
not
go
farther
when
he
talked
of
returning
however
glenarvan
appealed
to
his
companions
and
said
will
you
go
on
in
spite
of
all
the
difficulty
we
will
follow
your
lordship
replied
tom
austin
and
even
precede
you
added
paganel
what
is
it
after
all
we
have
only
to
cross
the
top
of
the
mountain
chain
and
once
over
nothing
can
be
easier
of
descent
than
the
slopes
we
shall
find
there
when
we
get
below
we
shall
find
baqueanos
argentine
shepherds
who
will
guide
us
through
the
pampas
and
swift
horses
accustomed
to
gallop
over
the
plains
let
s
go
forward
then
i
say
and
without
a
moment
s
forward
they
all
exclaimed
you
will
not
go
with
us
then
said
glenarvan
to
the
catapez
i
am
the
muleteer
was
the
reply
as
you
please
said
glenarvan
we
can
do
without
him
said
paganel
on
the
other
side
we
shall
get
back
into
the
road
to
antuco
and
i
m
quite
sure
i
ll
lead
you
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
as
straight
as
the
best
guide
in
the
accordingly
glenarvan
settled
accounts
with
the
catapez
and
bade
farewell
to
him
and
his
peons
and
mules
the
arms
and
instruments
and
a
small
stock
of
provisions
were
divided
among
the
seven
travelers
and
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
the
ascent
should
recommence
at
once
and
if
necessary
should
continue
part
of
the
night
there
was
a
very
steep
winding
path
on
the
left
which
the
mules
never
would
have
attempted
it
was
toilsome
work
but
after
two
hours
exertion
and
a
great
deal
of
roundabout
climbing
the
little
party
found
themselves
once
more
in
the
pass
of
antuco
they
were
not
far
now
from
the
highest
peak
of
the
cordilleras
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
any
beaten
path
the
entire
region
had
been
overturned
by
recent
shocks
of
earthquake
and
all
they
could
do
was
to
keep
on
climbing
higher
and
higher
paganel
was
rather
disconcerted
at
finding
no
way
out
to
the
other
side
of
the
chain
and
laid
his
account
with
having
to
undergo
great
fatigue
before
the
topmost
peaks
of
the
andes
could
be
reached
for
their
mean
height
is
between
eleven
and
twelve
thousand
six
hundred
feet
fortunately
the
weather
was
calm
and
the
sky
clear
in
addition
to
the
season
being
favorable
but
in
winter
from
may
to
october
such
an
ascent
would
have
been
impracticable
the
intense
cold
quickly
kills
travelers
and
those
who
even
manage
to
hold
out
against
it
fall
victims
to
the
violence
of
the
temporales
a
sort
of
hurricane
peculiar
to
those
regions
which
yearly
fills
the
abysses
of
the
cordilleras
with
dead
bodies
they
went
on
toiling
steadily
upward
all
night
hoisting
themselves
up
to
almost
inaccessible
plateaux
and
leaping
over
broad
deep
crevasses
they
had
no
ropes
but
arms
linked
in
arms
supplied
the
lack
and
shoulders
served
for
ladders
the
strength
of
mulrady
and
the
dexterity
of
wilson
were
taxed
heavily
now
these
two
brave
scots
multiplied
themselves
so
to
speak
many
a
time
but
for
their
devotion
and
courage
the
small
band
could
not
have
gone
on
glenarvan
never
lost
sight
of
young
robert
for
his
age
and
vivacity
made
him
imprudent
paganel
was
a
true
frenchman
in
his
impetuous
ardor
and
hurried
furiously
along
the
major
on
the
contrary
only
went
as
quick
as
was
necessary
neither
more
nor
less
climbing
without
the
least
apparent
exertion
perhaps
he
hardly
knew
indeed
that
he
was
climbing
at
all
or
perhaps
he
fancied
he
was
descending
the
whole
aspect
of
the
region
had
now
completely
changed
huge
blocks
of
glittering
ice
of
a
bluish
tint
on
some
of
the
declivities
stood
up
on
all
sides
reflecting
the
early
light
of
morn
the
ascent
became
very
perilous
they
were
obliged
to
reconnoiter
carefully
before
making
a
single
step
on
account
of
the
crevasses
wilson
took
the
lead
and
tried
the
ground
with
his
feet
his
companions
followed
exactly
in
his
footprints
lowering
their
voices
to
a
whisper
as
the
least
sound
would
disturb
the
currents
of
air
and
might
cause
the
fall
of
the
masses
of
snow
suspended
in
the
air
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
above
their
heads
they
had
come
now
to
the
region
of
shrubs
and
bushes
which
higher
still
gave
place
to
grasses
and
cacti
at
feet
all
trace
of
vegetation
had
disappeared
they
had
only
stopped
once
to
rest
and
snatch
a
hurried
meal
to
recruit
their
strength
with
superhuman
courage
the
ascent
was
then
resumed
amid
increasing
dangers
and
difficulties
they
were
forced
to
bestride
sharp
peaks
and
leap
over
chasms
so
deep
that
they
did
not
dare
to
look
down
them
in
many
places
wooden
crosses
marked
the
scene
of
some
great
catastrophes
about
two
o
clock
they
came
to
an
immense
barren
plain
without
a
sign
of
vegetation
the
air
was
dry
and
the
sky
unclouded
blue
at
this
elevation
rain
is
unknown
and
vapors
only
condense
into
snow
or
hail
here
and
there
peaks
of
porphyry
or
basalt
pierced
through
the
white
like
the
bones
of
a
skeleton
and
at
intervals
fragments
of
quartz
or
gneiss
loosened
by
the
action
of
the
air
fell
down
with
a
faint
dull
sound
which
in
a
denser
atmosphere
would
have
been
almost
imperceptible
however
in
spite
of
their
courage
the
strength
of
the
little
band
was
giving
way
glenarvan
regretted
they
had
gone
so
far
into
the
interior
of
the
mountain
when
he
saw
how
exhausted
his
men
had
become
young
robert
held
out
manfully
but
he
could
not
go
much
farther
at
three
o
clock
glenarvan
stopped
and
said
we
must
he
knew
if
he
did
not
himself
propose
it
no
one
else
would
rest
rejoined
paganel
we
have
no
place
of
it
is
absolutely
necessary
however
if
it
were
only
for
no
no
said
the
courageous
lad
i
can
still
walk
don
t
you
shall
be
carried
my
boy
but
we
must
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
cordilleras
cost
what
it
may
there
we
may
perhaps
find
some
hut
to
cover
us
all
i
ask
is
a
two
hours
longer
are
you
all
of
the
same
opinion
said
glenarvan
yes
was
the
unanimous
reply
and
mulrady
added
i
ll
carry
the
the
march
eastward
was
forthwith
resumed
they
had
a
frightful
height
to
climb
yet
to
gain
the
topmost
peaks
the
rarefaction
of
the
atmosphere
produced
that
painful
oppression
known
by
the
name
of
puna
drops
of
blood
stood
on
the
gums
and
lips
and
respiration
became
hurried
and
difficult
however
strong
the
will
of
these
brave
men
might
be
the
time
came
at
last
when
their
physical
powers
failed
and
vertigo
that
terrible
malady
in
the
mountains
destroyed
not
only
their
bodily
strength
but
their
moral
energy
falls
became
frequent
and
those
who
fell
could
not
rise
again
but
dragged
themselves
along
on
their
knees
but
just
as
exhaustion
was
about
to
make
short
work
of
any
further
ascent
and
glenarvan
s
heart
began
to
sink
as
he
thought
of
the
snow
lying
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
of
the
intense
cold
and
saw
the
shadow
of
night
fast
overspreading
the
desolate
peaks
and
knew
they
had
not
a
roof
to
shelter
them
suddenly
the
major
stopped
and
said
in
a
calm
voice
a
hut
chapter
xiii
a
sudden
descent
anyone
else
but
mcnabbs
might
have
passed
the
hut
a
hundred
times
and
gone
all
round
it
and
even
over
it
without
suspecting
its
existence
it
was
covered
with
snow
and
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
surrounding
rocks
but
wilson
and
mulrady
succeeded
in
digging
it
out
and
clearing
the
opening
after
half
an
hour
s
hard
work
to
the
great
joy
of
the
whole
party
who
eagerly
took
possession
of
it
they
found
it
was
a
casucha
constructed
by
the
indians
made
of
adobes
a
species
of
bricks
baked
in
the
sun
its
form
was
that
of
a
cube
feet
on
each
side
and
it
stood
on
a
block
of
basalt
a
stone
stair
led
up
to
the
door
the
only
opening
and
narrow
as
this
door
was
the
hurricane
and
snow
and
hail
found
their
way
in
when
the
temporales
were
unchained
in
the
mountains
ten
people
could
easily
find
room
in
it
and
though
the
walls
might
be
none
too
in
the
rainy
season
at
this
time
of
the
year
at
any
rate
it
was
sufficient
protection
against
the
intense
cold
which
according
to
the
thermometer
was
ten
degrees
below
zero
besides
there
was
a
sort
of
fireplace
in
it
with
a
chimney
of
bricks
badly
enough
put
together
certainly
but
still
it
allowed
of
a
fire
being
lighted
this
will
shelter
us
at
any
rate
said
glenarvan
even
if
it
is
not
very
comfortable
providence
has
led
us
to
it
and
we
can
only
be
why
it
is
a
perfect
palace
i
call
it
said
paganel
we
only
want
flunkeys
and
courtiers
we
shall
do
capital
especially
when
there
is
a
good
fire
blazing
on
the
hearth
for
we
are
quite
as
cold
as
we
are
hungry
for
my
part
i
would
rather
see
a
good
faggot
just
now
than
a
slice
of
well
tom
we
ll
try
and
get
some
combustible
or
other
said
paganel
combustibles
on
the
top
of
the
cordilleras
exclaimed
mulrady
in
a
dubious
tone
since
there
is
a
chimney
in
the
casucha
said
the
major
the
probability
is
that
we
shall
find
something
to
burn
in
our
friend
mcnabbs
is
right
said
glenarvan
get
everything
in
readiness
for
supper
and
i
ll
go
out
and
turn
wilson
and
i
will
go
with
you
said
paganel
do
you
want
me
asked
robert
getting
up
no
my
brave
boy
rest
yourself
you
ll
be
a
man
when
others
are
only
children
at
your
age
replied
glenarvan
on
reaching
the
little
mound
of
porphyry
glenarvan
and
his
two
companions
left
the
casucha
in
spite
of
the
perfect
calmness
of
the
atmosphere
the
cold
was
stinging
paganel
consulted
his
barometer
and
found
that
the
depression
of
the
mercury
corresponded
to
an
elevation
of
feet
only
meters
lower
than
mont
blanc
but
if
these
mountains
had
presented
the
difficulties
of
the
giant
of
the
swiss
alps
not
one
of
the
travelers
could
have
crossed
the
great
chain
of
the
new
world
on
reaching
a
little
mound
of
porphyry
glenarvan
and
paganel
stopped
to
gaze
about
them
and
scan
the
horizon
on
all
sides
they
were
now
on
the
summit
of
the
nevadas
of
the
cordilleras
and
could
see
over
an
area
of
forty
miles
the
valley
of
the
colorado
was
already
sunk
in
shadow
and
night
was
fast
drawing
her
mantle
over
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
andes
the
western
side
was
illumined
by
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
and
peaks
and
glaciers
flashed
back
his
golden
beams
with
dazzling
radiance
on
the
south
the
view
was
magnificent
across
the
wild
valley
of
the
torbido
about
two
miles
distant
rose
the
volcano
of
antuco
the
mountain
roared
like
some
enormous
monster
and
vomited
red
smoke
mingled
with
torrents
of
sooty
flame
the
surrounding
peaks
appeared
on
fire
showers
of
stones
clouds
of
reddish
vapor
and
rockets
of
lava
all
combined
presented
the
appearance
of
glowing
sparkling
streams
the
splendor
of
the
spectacle
increased
every
instant
as
night
deepened
and
the
whole
sky
became
lighted
up
with
a
dazzling
reflection
of
the
blazing
crater
while
the
sun
gradually
becoming
shorn
of
his
sunset
glories
disappeared
like
a
star
lost
in
the
distant
darkness
of
the
horizon
paganel
and
glenarvan
would
have
remained
long
enough
gazing
at
the
sublime
struggle
between
the
fires
of
earth
and
heaven
if
the
more
practical
wilson
had
not
reminded
them
of
the
business
on
hand
there
was
no
wood
to
be
found
however
but
fortunately
the
rocks
were
covered
with
a
poor
dry
species
of
lichen
of
this
they
made
an
ample
provision
as
well
as
of
a
plant
called
llaretta
the
root
of
which
burns
tolerably
well
this
precious
combustible
was
carried
back
to
the
casucha
and
heaped
up
on
the
hearth
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
kindle
it
though
and
still
more
to
keep
it
alight
the
air
was
so
rarefied
that
there
was
scarcely
oxygen
enough
in
it
to
support
combustion
at
least
this
was
the
reason
assigned
by
the
major
by
way
of
compensation
however
he
added
water
will
boil
at
less
than
degrees
heat
it
will
come
to
the
point
of
ebullition
before
mcnabbs
was
right
as
the
thermometer
proved
for
it
was
plunged
into
the
kettle
when
the
water
boiled
and
the
mercury
only
rose
to
degrees
coffee
was
soon
ready
and
eagerly
gulped
down
by
everybody
the
dry
meat
certainly
seemed
poor
fare
and
paganel
couldn
t
help
saying
i
tell
you
what
some
grilled
llama
wouldn
t
be
bad
with
this
would
it
they
say
that
the
llama
is
substitute
for
the
ox
and
the
sheep
and
i
should
like
to
know
if
it
is
in
an
alimentary
what
replied
the
major
you
re
not
content
with
your
supper
most
learned
enchanted
with
it
my
brave
major
still
i
must
confess
i
should
not
say
no
to
a
dish
of
you
are
a
i
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
but
come
now
though
you
call
me
that
you
wouldn
t
sulk
at
a
beefsteak
yourself
would
you
probably
and
if
you
were
asked
to
lie
in
wait
for
a
llama
notwithstanding
the
cold
and
the
darkness
you
would
do
it
without
the
least
hesitation
of
course
and
if
it
will
give
you
the
slightest
pleasure
his
companions
had
hardly
time
to
thank
him
for
his
obliging
good
nature
when
distant
and
prolonged
howls
broke
on
their
ear
plainly
not
proceeding
from
one
or
two
solitary
animals
but
from
a
whole
troop
and
one
moreover
that
was
rapidly
approaching
providence
had
sent
them
a
supper
as
well
as
led
them
to
a
hut
this
was
the
geographer
s
conclusion
but
glenarvan
damped
his
joy
somewhat
by
remarking
that
the
quadrupeds
of
the
cordilleras
are
never
met
with
in
such
a
high
latitude
then
where
can
these
animals
come
from
asked
tom
austin
don
t
you
hear
them
getting
nearer
an
avalanche
suggested
mulrady
impossible
returned
paganel
that
is
regular
let
us
go
out
and
see
said
glenarvan
yes
and
be
ready
for
hunting
replied
mcnabbs
arming
himself
with
his
carbine
they
all
rushed
forthwith
out
of
the
casucha
night
had
completely
set
in
dark
and
starry
the
moon
now
in
her
last
quarter
had
not
yet
risen
the
peaks
on
the
north
and
east
had
disappeared
from
view
and
nothing
was
visible
save
the
fantastic
silhouette
of
some
towering
rocks
here
and
there
the
howls
and
clearly
the
howls
of
terrified
animals
were
redoubled
they
proceeded
from
that
part
of
the
cordilleras
which
lay
in
darkness
what
could
be
going
on
there
suddenly
a
furious
avalanche
came
down
an
avalanche
of
living
animals
mad
with
fear
the
whole
plateau
seemed
to
tremble
there
were
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
these
animals
and
in
spite
of
the
rarefied
atmosphere
their
noise
was
deafening
were
they
wild
beasts
from
the
pampas
or
herds
of
llamas
and
vicunas
glenarvan
mcnabbs
robert
austin
and
the
two
sailors
had
just
time
to
throw
themselves
flat
on
the
ground
before
they
swept
past
like
a
whirlwind
only
a
few
paces
distant
paganel
who
had
remained
standing
to
take
advantage
of
his
peculiar
powers
of
sight
was
knocked
down
in
a
twinkling
at
the
same
moment
the
report
of
firearms
was
heard
the
major
had
fired
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
an
animal
had
fallen
close
by
and
that
the
whole
herd
yelling
louder
than
ever
had
rushed
down
and
disappeared
among
the
declivities
lighted
up
by
the
reflection
of
the
volcano
ah
i
ve
got
them
said
a
voice
the
voice
of
paganel
got
what
asked
glenarvan
my
spectacles
was
the
reply
one
might
expect
to
lose
that
much
in
such
a
tumult
as
you
are
not
wounded
i
hope
no
only
knocked
down
but
by
what
by
this
replied
the
major
holding
up
the
animal
he
had
killed
they
all
hastened
eagerly
into
the
hut
to
examine
mcnabbs
prize
by
the
light
of
the
fire
it
was
a
pretty
creature
like
a
small
camel
without
a
hump
the
head
was
small
and
the
body
flattened
the
legs
were
long
and
slender
the
skin
fine
and
the
hair
the
color
of
au
paganel
had
scarcely
looked
at
it
before
he
exclaimed
a
guanaco
what
sort
of
an
animal
is
that
asked
glenarvan
one
you
can
and
it
is
good
savory
meat
i
assure
you
a
dish
of
olympus
i
knew
we
should
have
fresh
meat
for
supper
and
such
meat
but
who
is
going
to
cut
up
the
beast
i
will
said
wilson
well
i
ll
undertake
to
cook
it
said
paganel
can
you
cook
then
monsieur
paganel
asked
robert
i
should
think
so
my
boy
i
m
a
frenchman
and
in
every
frenchman
there
is
a
five
minutes
afterward
paganel
began
to
grill
large
slices
of
venison
on
the
embers
made
by
the
use
of
the
llarettas
and
in
about
ten
minutes
a
dish
was
ready
which
he
served
up
to
his
companions
by
the
tempting
name
of
guanaco
cutlets
no
one
stood
on
ceremony
but
fell
to
with
a
hearty
good
will
to
the
absolute
stupefaction
of
the
geographer
however
the
first
mouthful
was
greeted
with
a
general
grimace
and
such
exclamations
as
tough
it
is
it
is
not
the
poor
savant
was
obliged
to
own
that
his
cutlets
could
not
be
relished
even
by
hungry
men
they
began
to
banter
him
about
his
olympian
dish
and
indulge
in
jokes
at
his
expense
but
all
he
cared
about
was
to
find
out
how
it
happened
that
the
flesh
of
the
guanaco
which
was
certainly
good
and
eatable
food
had
turned
out
so
badly
in
his
hands
at
last
light
broke
in
on
him
and
he
called
out
i
see
through
it
now
yes
i
see
through
it
i
have
found
out
the
secret
the
meat
was
too
long
kept
was
it
asked
mcnabbs
quietly
no
but
the
meat
had
walked
too
much
how
could
i
have
forgotten
that
what
do
you
mean
asked
tom
austin
i
mean
this
the
guanaco
is
only
good
for
eating
when
it
is
killed
in
a
state
of
rest
if
it
has
been
long
hunted
and
gone
over
much
ground
before
it
is
captured
it
is
no
longer
eatable
i
can
affirm
the
fact
by
the
mere
taste
that
this
animal
has
come
a
great
distance
and
consequently
the
whole
herd
you
are
certain
of
this
asked
glenarvan
absolutely
but
what
could
have
frightened
the
creatures
so
and
driven
them
from
their
haunts
when
they
ought
to
have
been
quietly
sleeping
that
s
a
question
my
dear
glenarvan
i
could
not
possibly
answer
take
my
advice
and
let
us
go
to
sleep
without
troubling
our
heads
about
it
i
say
major
shall
we
go
to
sleep
yes
we
ll
go
to
sleep
each
one
thereupon
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
poncho
and
the
fire
was
made
up
for
the
night
loud
snores
in
every
tune
and
key
soon
resounded
from
all
sides
of
the
hut
the
deep
bass
contribution
of
paganel
completing
the
harmony
but
glenarvan
could
not
sleep
secret
uneasiness
kept
him
in
a
continual
state
of
wakefulness
his
thoughts
reverted
involuntarily
to
those
frightened
animals
flying
in
one
common
direction
impelled
by
one
common
terror
they
could
not
be
pursued
by
wild
beasts
for
at
such
an
elevation
there
were
almost
none
to
be
met
with
and
of
hunters
still
fewer
what
terror
then
could
have
driven
them
among
the
precipices
of
the
andes
glenarvan
felt
a
presentiment
of
approaching
danger
but
gradually
he
fell
into
a
state
and
his
apprehensions
were
lulled
hope
took
the
place
of
fear
he
saw
himself
on
the
morrow
on
the
plains
of
the
andes
where
the
search
would
actually
commence
and
perhaps
success
was
close
at
hand
he
thought
of
captain
grant
and
his
two
sailors
and
their
deliverance
from
cruel
bondage
as
these
visions
passed
rapidly
through
his
mind
every
now
and
then
he
was
roused
by
the
crackling
of
the
fire
or
sparks
flying
out
or
some
little
jet
of
flame
would
suddenly
flare
up
and
illumine
the
faces
of
his
slumbering
companions
then
his
presentiments
returned
in
greater
strength
than
before
and
he
listened
anxiously
to
the
sounds
outside
the
hut
at
certain
intervals
he
fancied
he
could
hear
rumbling
noises
in
the
distance
dull
and
threatening
like
the
of
thunder
before
a
storm
there
surely
must
be
a
storm
raging
down
below
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
he
got
up
and
went
out
to
see
the
moon
was
rising
the
atmosphere
was
pure
and
calm
not
a
cloud
visible
either
above
or
below
here
and
there
was
a
passing
reflection
from
the
flames
of
antuco
but
neither
storm
nor
lightning
and
myriads
of
bright
stars
studded
the
zenith
still
the
rumbling
noises
continued
they
seemed
to
meet
together
and
cross
the
chain
of
the
andes
glenarvan
returned
to
the
casucha
more
uneasy
than
ever
questioning
within
himself
as
to
the
connection
between
these
sounds
and
the
flight
of
the
guanacos
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
the
time
was
about
two
in
the
morning
as
he
had
no
certainty
however
of
any
immediate
danger
he
did
not
wake
his
companions
who
were
sleeping
soundly
after
their
fatigue
and
after
a
little
dozed
off
himself
and
slumbered
heavily
for
some
hours
all
of
a
sudden
a
violent
crash
made
him
start
to
his
feet
a
deafening
noise
fell
on
his
ear
like
the
roar
of
artillery
he
felt
the
ground
giving
way
beneath
him
and
the
casucha
rocked
to
and
fro
and
opened
he
shouted
to
his
companions
but
they
were
already
awake
and
tumbling
over
each
other
they
were
being
rapidly
dragged
down
a
steep
declivity
day
dawned
and
revealed
a
terrible
scene
the
form
of
the
mountains
changed
in
an
instant
cones
were
cut
off
tottering
peaks
disappeared
as
if
some
trap
had
opened
at
their
base
owing
to
a
peculiar
phenomenon
of
the
cordilleras
an
enormous
mass
many
miles
in
extent
had
been
displaced
entirely
and
was
speeding
down
toward
the
plain
an
earthquake
exclaimed
paganel
he
was
not
mistaken
it
was
one
of
those
cataclysms
frequent
in
chili
and
in
this
very
region
where
copiapo
had
been
twice
destroyed
and
santiago
four
times
laid
in
ruins
in
fourteen
years
this
region
of
the
globe
is
so
underlaid
with
volcanic
fires
and
the
volcanoes
of
recent
origin
are
such
insufficient
safety
valves
for
the
subterranean
vapors
that
shocks
are
of
frequent
occurrence
and
are
called
by
the
people
tremblores
the
plateau
to
which
the
seven
men
were
clinging
holding
on
by
tufts
of
lichen
and
giddy
and
terrified
in
the
extreme
was
rushing
down
the
declivity
with
the
swiftness
of
an
express
at
the
rate
of
fifty
miles
an
hour
not
a
cry
was
possible
nor
an
attempt
to
get
off
or
stop
they
could
not
even
have
heard
themselves
speak
the
internal
rumblings
the
crash
of
the
avalanches
the
fall
of
masses
of
granite
and
basalt
and
the
whirlwind
of
pulverized
snow
made
all
communication
impossible
sometimes
they
went
perfectly
smoothly
along
without
jolts
or
jerks
and
sometimes
on
the
contrary
the
plateau
would
reel
and
roll
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
coasting
past
abysses
in
which
fragments
of
the
mountain
were
falling
tearing
up
trees
by
the
roots
and
leveling
as
if
with
the
keen
edge
of
an
immense
scythe
every
projection
of
the
declivity
how
long
this
indescribable
descent
would
last
no
one
could
calculate
nor
what
it
would
end
in
ultimately
none
of
the
party
knew
whether
the
rest
were
still
alive
whether
one
or
another
were
not
already
lying
in
the
depths
of
some
abyss
almost
breathless
with
the
swift
motion
frozen
with
the
cold
air
which
pierced
them
through
and
blinded
with
the
whirling
snow
they
gasped
for
breath
and
became
exhausted
and
nearly
inanimate
only
retaining
their
hold
of
the
rocks
by
a
powerful
instinct
of
suddenly
a
tremendous
shock
pitched
them
right
off
and
sent
them
rolling
to
the
very
foot
of
the
mountain
the
plateau
had
stopped
for
some
minutes
no
one
stirred
at
last
one
of
the
party
picked
himself
up
and
stood
on
his
feet
stunned
by
the
shock
but
still
firm
on
his
legs
this
was
the
major
he
shook
off
the
blinding
snow
and
looked
around
him
his
companions
lay
in
a
close
circle
like
the
shots
from
a
gun
that
has
just
been
discharged
piled
one
on
top
of
another
the
major
counted
them
all
were
there
except
one
that
one
was
robert
grant
chapter
xiv
providentially
rescued
the
eastern
side
of
the
cordilleras
of
the
andes
consists
of
a
succession
of
lengthened
declivities
which
slope
down
almost
insensibly
to
the
plain
the
soil
is
carpeted
with
rich
herbage
and
adorned
with
magnificent
trees
among
which
in
great
numbers
were
planted
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
and
golden
with
fruit
there
were
literally
perfect
forests
of
these
this
district
was
in
fact
just
a
corner
of
fertile
normandy
the
sudden
transition
from
a
desert
to
an
oasis
from
snowy
peaks
to
verdant
plains
from
winter
to
summer
can
not
fail
to
strike
the
traveler
s
eye
the
ground
moreover
had
recovered
its
immobility
the
trembling
had
ceased
though
there
was
little
doubt
the
forces
below
the
surface
were
carrying
on
their
devastating
work
further
on
for
shocks
of
earthquake
are
always
occurring
in
some
part
or
other
of
the
andes
this
time
the
shock
had
been
one
of
extreme
violence
the
outline
of
the
mountains
was
wholly
altered
and
the
pampas
guides
would
have
sought
vainly
for
the
accustomed
landmarks
a
magnificent
day
had
dawned
the
sun
was
just
rising
from
his
ocean
bed
and
his
bright
rays
streamed
already
over
the
argentine
plains
and
ran
across
to
the
atlantic
it
was
about
eight
o
clock
lord
glenarvan
and
his
companions
were
gradually
restored
to
animation
by
the
major
s
efforts
they
had
been
completely
stunned
but
had
sustained
no
injury
whatever
the
descent
of
the
cordilleras
was
accomplished
and
as
dame
nature
had
conveyed
them
at
her
own
expense
they
could
only
have
praised
her
method
of
locomotion
if
one
of
their
number
and
that
one
the
feeblest
and
youngest
the
child
of
the
party
had
not
been
missing
at
the
roll
call
the
brave
boy
was
beloved
by
everybody
paganel
was
particularly
attached
to
him
and
so
was
the
major
with
all
his
apparent
coldness
as
for
glenarvan
he
was
in
absolute
despair
when
he
heard
of
his
disappearance
and
pictured
to
himself
the
child
lying
in
some
deep
abyss
wildly
crying
for
succor
we
must
go
and
look
for
him
and
look
till
we
find
him
he
exclaimed
almost
unable
to
keep
back
his
tears
we
can
not
leave
him
to
his
fate
every
valley
and
precipice
and
abyss
must
be
searched
through
and
through
i
will
have
a
rope
fastened
round
my
waist
and
go
down
myself
i
insist
upon
it
you
understand
i
insist
upon
it
heaven
grant
robert
may
be
still
alive
if
we
lose
the
boy
how
could
we
ever
dare
to
meet
the
father
what
right
have
we
to
save
the
captain
at
the
cost
of
his
son
s
life
glenarvan
s
companions
heard
him
in
silence
he
sought
to
read
hope
in
their
eyes
but
they
did
not
venture
to
meet
his
gaze
at
last
he
said
well
you
hear
what
i
say
but
you
make
no
response
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
no
hope
not
the
slightest
again
there
was
silence
till
mcnabbs
asked
which
of
you
can
recollect
when
robert
disappeared
no
one
could
say
well
then
resumed
the
major
you
know
this
at
any
rate
who
was
the
child
beside
during
our
descent
of
the
cordilleras
beside
me
replied
wilson
very
well
up
to
what
moment
did
you
see
him
beside
you
try
if
you
can
all
that
i
can
recollect
is
that
robert
grant
was
still
by
my
side
holding
fast
by
a
tuft
of
lichen
less
than
two
minutes
before
the
shock
which
finished
our
less
than
two
minutes
mind
what
you
are
saying
i
dare
say
a
minute
seemed
a
very
long
time
to
you
are
you
sure
you
are
not
making
a
mistake
i
don
t
think
i
am
no
it
was
just
about
two
minutes
as
i
tell
very
well
then
and
was
robert
on
your
right
or
left
on
my
left
i
remember
that
his
poncho
brushed
past
my
and
with
regard
to
us
how
were
you
placed
on
the
left
then
robert
must
have
disappeared
on
this
side
said
the
major
turning
toward
the
mountain
and
pointing
toward
the
right
and
i
should
judge
he
added
considering
the
time
that
has
elapsed
that
the
spot
where
he
fell
is
about
two
miles
up
between
that
height
and
the
ground
is
where
we
must
search
dividing
the
different
zones
among
us
and
it
is
there
we
shall
find
not
another
word
was
spoken
the
six
men
commenced
their
explorations
keeping
constantly
to
the
line
they
had
made
in
their
descent
examining
closely
every
fissure
and
going
into
the
very
depths
of
the
abysses
choked
up
though
they
partly
were
with
fragments
of
the
plateau
and
more
than
one
came
out
again
with
garments
torn
to
rags
and
feet
and
hands
bleeding
for
many
long
hours
these
brave
fellows
continued
their
search
without
dreaming
of
taking
rest
but
all
in
vain
the
child
had
not
only
met
his
death
on
the
mountain
but
found
a
grave
which
some
enormous
rock
had
sealed
forever
about
one
o
clock
glenarvan
and
his
companions
met
again
in
the
valley
glenarvan
was
completely
crushed
with
grief
he
scarcely
spoke
the
only
words
that
escaped
his
lips
amid
his
sighs
were
i
shall
not
go
away
i
shall
not
go
away
no
one
of
the
party
but
could
enter
into
his
feeling
and
respect
it
let
us
wait
said
paganel
to
the
major
and
tom
austin
we
will
take
a
little
rest
and
recruit
our
strength
we
need
it
anyway
either
to
prolong
our
search
or
continue
our
yes
and
as
edward
wishes
it
we
will
rest
he
has
still
hope
but
what
is
it
he
hopes
who
knows
said
tom
austin
poor
robert
replied
paganel
brushing
away
a
tear
the
valley
was
thickly
wooded
and
the
major
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
suitable
place
of
encampment
he
chose
a
clump
of
tall
carob
trees
under
which
they
arranged
their
few
belongings
few
indeed
for
all
they
had
were
sundry
wraps
and
and
a
little
dried
meat
and
rice
not
far
off
there
was
a
rio
which
supplied
them
with
water
though
it
was
still
somewhat
muddy
after
the
disturbance
of
the
avalanche
mulrady
soon
had
a
fire
lighted
on
the
grass
and
a
warm
refreshing
beverage
to
offer
his
master
but
glenarvan
refused
to
touch
it
and
lay
stretched
on
his
poncho
in
a
state
of
absolute
prostration
so
the
day
passed
and
night
came
on
calm
and
peaceful
as
the
preceding
had
been
while
his
companions
were
lying
motionless
though
wide
awake
glenarvan
betook
himself
once
more
to
the
slopes
of
the
cordilleras
listening
intently
in
hope
that
some
cry
for
help
would
fall
upon
his
ear
he
ventured
far
up
in
spite
of
his
being
alone
straining
his
ear
with
painful
eagerness
to
catch
the
faintest
sound
and
calling
aloud
in
an
agony
of
despair
but
he
heard
nothing
save
the
beatings
of
his
own
heart
though
he
wandered
all
night
on
the
mountain
sometimes
the
major
followed
him
and
sometimes
paganel
ready
to
lend
a
helping
hand
among
the
slippery
peaks
and
dangerous
precipices
among
which
he
was
dragged
by
his
rash
and
useless
imprudence
all
his
efforts
were
in
vain
however
and
to
his
repeated
cries
of
robert
robert
echo
was
the
only
response
day
dawned
and
it
now
became
a
matter
of
necessity
to
go
and
bring
back
the
poor
lord
from
the
distant
plateau
even
against
his
will
his
despair
was
terrible
who
could
dare
to
speak
of
quitting
this
fatal
valley
yet
provisions
were
done
and
argentine
guides
and
horses
were
not
far
off
to
lead
them
to
the
pampas
to
go
back
would
be
more
difficult
than
to
go
forward
besides
the
atlantic
ocean
was
the
appointed
meeting
place
with
the
duncan
these
were
strong
reasons
against
any
long
delay
indeed
it
was
best
for
all
parties
to
continue
the
route
as
soon
as
possible
mcnabbs
undertook
the
task
of
rousing
lord
glenarvan
from
his
grief
for
a
long
time
his
cousin
seemed
not
to
hear
him
at
last
he
shook
his
head
and
said
almost
did
you
say
we
must
start
yes
we
must
wait
one
hour
yes
we
ll
wait
another
replied
the
major
the
hour
slipped
away
and
again
glenarvan
begged
for
longer
grace
to
hear
his
imploring
tones
one
might
have
thought
him
a
criminal
begging
a
respite
so
the
day
passed
on
till
it
was
almost
noon
mcnabbs
hesitated
now
no
longer
but
acting
on
the
advice
of
the
rest
told
his
cousin
that
start
they
must
for
all
their
lives
depended
on
prompt
action
yes
yes
replied
glenarvan
let
us
start
let
us
start
but
he
spoke
without
looking
at
mcnabbs
his
gaze
was
fixed
intently
on
a
certain
dark
speck
in
the
heavens
suddenly
he
exclaimed
extending
his
arm
and
keeping
it
motionless
as
if
petrified
there
there
look
look
all
eyes
turned
immediately
in
the
direction
indicated
so
imperiously
the
dark
speck
was
increasing
visibly
it
was
evidently
some
bird
hovering
above
them
a
condor
said
paganel
yes
a
condor
replied
glenarvan
who
knows
he
is
coming
down
he
is
gradually
getting
lower
let
us
paganel
was
not
mistaken
it
was
assuredly
a
condor
this
magnificent
bird
is
the
king
of
the
southern
andes
and
was
formerly
worshiped
by
the
incas
it
attains
an
extraordinary
development
in
those
regions
its
strength
is
prodigious
it
has
frequently
driven
oxen
over
the
edge
of
precipices
down
into
the
depths
of
abysses
it
seizes
sheep
and
kids
and
young
calves
browsing
on
the
plains
and
carries
them
off
to
inaccessible
heights
it
hovers
in
the
air
far
beyond
the
utmost
limits
of
human
sight
and
its
powers
of
vision
are
so
great
that
it
can
discern
the
smallest
objects
on
the
earth
beneath
what
had
this
condor
discovered
then
could
it
be
the
corpse
of
robert
grant
who
knows
repeated
glenarvan
keeping
his
eye
immovably
fixed
on
the
bird
the
enormous
creature
was
fast
approaching
sometimes
hovering
for
awhile
with
outspread
wings
and
sometimes
falling
with
the
swiftness
of
inert
bodies
in
space
presently
he
began
to
wheel
round
in
wide
circles
they
could
see
him
distinctly
he
measured
more
than
fifteen
feet
and
his
powerful
wings
bore
him
along
with
scarcely
the
slightest
effort
for
it
is
the
prerogative
of
large
birds
to
fly
with
calm
majesty
while
insects
have
to
beat
their
wings
a
thousand
times
a
second
the
major
and
wilson
had
seized
their
carbines
but
glenarvan
stopped
them
by
a
gesture
the
condor
was
encircling
in
his
flight
a
sort
of
inaccessible
plateau
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
he
wheeled
round
and
round
with
dazzling
rapidity
opening
and
shutting
his
formidable
claws
and
shaking
his
cartilaginous
carbuncle
or
comb
it
is
there
there
exclaimed
glenarvan
a
sudden
thought
flashed
across
his
mind
and
with
a
terrible
cry
he
called
out
fire
fire
oh
suppose
robert
were
still
alive
that
but
it
was
too
late
the
condor
had
dropped
out
of
sight
behind
the
crags
only
a
second
passed
a
second
that
seemed
an
age
and
the
enormous
bird
reappeared
carrying
a
heavy
load
and
flying
at
a
slow
rate
a
cry
of
horror
rose
on
all
sides
it
was
a
human
body
the
condor
had
in
his
claws
dangling
in
the
air
and
apparently
lifeless
it
was
robert
grant
the
bird
had
seized
him
by
his
clothes
and
had
him
hanging
already
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
the
air
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
travelers
and
was
flapping
his
wings
violently
endeavoring
to
escape
with
his
heavy
prey
oh
would
that
robert
were
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
rocks
rather
than
be
a
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
seizing
wilson
s
carbine
took
aim
at
the
condor
his
arm
was
too
trembling
however
to
keep
the
weapon
steady
let
me
do
it
said
the
major
and
with
a
calm
eye
and
sure
hands
and
motionless
body
he
aimed
at
the
bird
now
three
hundred
feet
above
him
in
the
air
but
before
he
had
pulled
the
trigger
the
report
of
a
gun
resounded
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
a
white
smoke
rose
from
between
two
masses
of
basalt
and
the
condor
shot
in
the
head
gradually
turned
over
and
began
to
fall
supported
by
his
great
wings
spread
out
like
a
parachute
he
had
not
let
go
his
prey
but
gently
sank
down
with
it
on
the
ground
about
ten
paces
from
the
stream
we
ve
got
him
we
ve
got
him
shouted
glenarvan
and
without
waiting
to
see
where
the
shot
so
providentially
came
from
he
rushed
toward
the
condor
followed
by
his
companions
when
they
reached
the
spot
the
bird
was
dead
and
the
body
of
robert
was
quite
concealed
beneath
his
mighty
wings
glenarvan
flung
himself
on
the
corpse
and
dragging
it
from
the
condor
s
grasp
placed
it
flat
on
the
grass
and
knelt
down
and
put
his
ear
to
the
heart
but
a
wilder
cry
of
joy
never
broke
from
human
lips
than
glenarvan
uttered
the
next
moment
as
he
started
to
his
feet
and
exclaimed
he
is
alive
he
is
still
alive
the
boy
s
clothes
were
stripped
off
in
an
instant
and
his
face
bathed
with
cold
water
he
moved
slightly
opened
his
eyes
looked
round
and
murmured
oh
my
lord
is
it
you
he
said
my
father
glenarvan
could
not
reply
he
was
speechless
with
emotion
and
kneeling
down
by
the
side
of
the
child
so
miraculously
saved
burst
into
tears
chapter
xv
thalcave
robert
had
no
sooner
escaped
one
terrible
danger
than
he
ran
the
risk
of
another
scarcely
less
formidable
he
was
almost
torn
to
pieces
by
his
friends
for
the
brave
fellows
were
so
overjoyed
at
the
sight
of
him
that
in
spite
of
his
weak
state
none
of
them
would
be
satisfied
without
giving
him
a
hug
however
it
seemed
as
if
good
rough
hugging
did
not
hurt
sick
people
at
any
rate
it
did
not
hurt
robert
but
quite
the
contrary
but
the
first
joy
of
deliverance
over
the
next
thought
was
who
was
the
deliverer
of
course
it
was
the
major
who
suggested
looking
for
him
and
he
was
not
far
off
for
about
fifty
paces
from
the
rio
a
man
of
very
tall
stature
was
seen
standing
motionless
on
the
lowest
crags
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
a
long
gun
was
lying
at
his
feet
he
had
broad
shoulders
and
long
hair
bound
together
with
leather
thongs
he
was
over
six
feet
in
height
his
bronzed
face
was
red
between
the
eyes
and
mouth
black
by
the
lower
eyelids
and
white
on
the
forehead
he
wore
the
costume
of
the
patagonians
on
the
frontiers
consisting
of
a
splendid
cloak
ornamented
with
scarlet
arabesques
made
of
the
skins
of
the
guanaco
sewed
together
with
ostrich
tendons
and
with
the
silky
wool
turned
up
on
the
edge
under
this
mantle
was
a
garment
of
fastened
round
the
waist
and
coming
down
to
a
point
in
front
a
little
bag
hung
from
his
belt
containing
colors
for
painting
his
face
his
boots
were
pieces
of
ox
hide
fastened
round
the
ankles
by
straps
across
this
patagonian
had
a
splendid
face
indicating
real
intelligence
notwithstanding
the
medley
of
colors
by
which
it
was
disfigured
his
waiting
attitude
was
full
of
dignity
indeed
to
see
him
standing
grave
and
motionless
on
his
pedestal
of
rocks
one
might
have
taken
him
for
a
statue
of
as
soon
as
the
major
perceived
him
he
pointed
him
out
to
glenarvan
who
ran
toward
him
immediately
the
patagonian
came
two
steps
forward
to
meet
him
and
glenarvan
caught
hold
of
his
hand
and
pressed
it
in
his
own
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
meaning
of
the
action
for
the
noble
face
of
the
scotch
lord
so
beamed
with
gratitude
that
no
words
were
needed
the
stranger
bowed
slightly
in
return
and
said
a
few
words
that
neither
glenarvan
nor
the
major
could
understand
the
patagonian
surveyed
them
attentively
for
a
few
minutes
and
spoke
again
in
another
language
but
this
second
idiom
was
no
more
intelligible
than
the
first
certain
words
however
caught
glenarvan
s
ear
as
sounding
like
spanish
a
few
sentences
of
which
he
could
speak
espanol
he
asked
the
patagonian
nodded
in
reply
a
movement
of
the
head
which
has
an
affirmative
significance
among
all
nations
that
s
good
said
the
major
our
friend
paganel
will
be
the
very
man
for
him
it
is
lucky
for
us
that
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
learn
paganel
was
called
forthwith
he
came
at
once
and
saluted
the
stranger
with
all
the
grace
of
a
frenchman
but
his
compliments
were
lost
on
the
patagonian
for
he
did
not
understand
a
single
syllable
however
on
being
told
how
things
stood
he
began
in
spanish
and
opening
his
mouth
as
wide
as
he
could
the
better
to
articulate
said
sois
um
homen
de
you
are
a
brave
man
the
native
listened
but
made
no
reply
he
doesn
t
understand
said
the
geographer
perhaps
you
haven
t
the
right
accent
suggested
the
major
that
s
just
it
confound
the
accent
once
more
paganel
repeated
his
compliment
but
with
no
better
success
i
ll
change
the
phrase
he
said
and
in
slow
deliberate
tones
he
went
on
duvida
um
a
patagonian
undoubtedly
no
response
still
dizeime
said
paganel
answer
me
but
no
answer
came
compriendeis
do
you
understand
shouted
paganel
at
the
very
top
of
his
voice
as
if
he
would
burst
his
throat
evidently
the
indian
did
not
understand
for
he
replied
in
spanish
i
do
not
understand
it
was
paganel
s
turn
now
to
be
amazed
he
pushed
his
spectacles
right
down
over
his
nose
as
if
greatly
irritated
and
said
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
can
make
out
one
word
of
his
infernal
patois
it
is
araucanian
that
s
certain
not
a
bit
of
it
said
glenarvan
it
was
spanish
he
and
addressing
the
patagonian
he
repeated
the
word
espanol
spanish
yes
yes
replied
the
indian
paganel
s
surprise
became
absolute
stupefaction
the
major
and
his
cousin
exchanged
sly
glances
and
mcnabbs
said
mischievously
with
a
look
of
fun
on
his
face
ah
ah
my
worthy
friend
is
this
another
of
your
misadventures
you
seem
to
have
quite
a
monopoly
of
what
said
paganel
pricking
up
his
ear
yes
it
s
clear
enough
the
man
speaks
he
yes
he
certainly
speaks
spanish
perhaps
it
is
some
other
language
you
have
been
studying
all
this
time
instead
of
but
paganel
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
stiffly
you
go
a
little
too
far
well
how
is
it
that
you
don
t
understand
him
then
why
of
course
because
the
man
speaks
badly
replied
the
learned
geographer
getting
impatient
he
speaks
badly
that
is
to
say
because
you
can
t
understand
him
returned
the
major
coolly
come
come
mcnabbs
put
in
glenarvan
your
supposition
is
quite
inadmissable
however
distrait
our
friend
paganel
is
it
is
hardly
likely
he
would
study
one
language
for
well
edward
or
rather
you
my
good
paganel
explain
it
i
explain
nothing
i
give
proof
here
is
the
book
i
use
daily
to
practice
myself
in
the
difficulties
of
the
spanish
language
examine
it
for
yourself
major
he
said
handing
him
a
volume
in
a
very
ragged
condition
which
he
had
brought
up
after
a
long
rummage
from
the
depths
of
one
of
his
numerous
pockets
now
you
can
see
whether
i
am
imposing
on
you
he
continued
indignantly
and
what
s
the
name
of
this
book
asked
the
major
as
he
took
it
from
his
hand
the
lusiades
an
admirable
epic
which
the
lusiades
exclaimed
glenarvan
yes
my
friend
the
lusiades
of
the
great
camoens
neither
more
nor
camoens
repeated
glenarvan
but
paganel
my
unfortunate
fellow
camoens
was
a
portuguese
it
is
portuguese
you
have
been
learning
for
the
last
six
weeks
camoens
luisades
portuguese
paganel
could
not
say
more
he
looked
vexed
while
his
companions
who
had
all
gathered
round
broke
out
in
a
furious
burst
of
laughter
the
indian
never
moved
a
muscle
of
his
face
he
quietly
awaited
the
explanation
of
this
incomprehensible
mirth
fool
idiot
that
i
am
at
last
uttered
paganel
is
it
really
a
fact
you
are
not
joking
with
me
it
is
what
i
have
actually
been
doing
why
it
is
a
second
confusion
of
tongues
like
babel
ah
me
my
friends
what
is
to
become
of
me
to
start
for
india
and
arrive
at
chili
to
learn
spanish
and
talk
portuguese
why
if
i
go
on
like
this
some
day
i
shall
be
throwing
myself
out
of
the
window
instead
of
my
cigar
to
hear
paganel
bemoan
his
misadventures
and
see
his
comical
discomfiture
would
have
upset
anyone
s
gravity
besides
he
set
the
example
himself
and
said
laugh
away
my
friends
laugh
as
loud
as
you
like
you
can
t
laugh
at
me
half
as
much
as
i
laugh
at
myself
but
i
say
said
the
major
after
a
minute
this
doesn
t
alter
the
fact
that
we
have
no
oh
don
t
distress
yourself
about
that
replied
paganel
portuguese
and
spanish
are
so
much
alike
that
i
made
a
mistake
but
this
very
resemblance
will
be
a
great
help
toward
rectifying
it
in
a
very
short
time
i
shall
be
able
to
thank
the
patagonian
in
the
language
he
speaks
so
paganel
was
right
he
soon
managed
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
the
stranger
and
found
out
even
that
his
name
was
thalcave
a
word
that
signified
in
araucanian
the
this
surname
had
no
doubt
come
from
his
skill
in
handling
but
what
rejoiced
glenarvan
most
was
to
learn
that
he
was
a
guide
by
occupation
and
moreover
a
guide
across
the
pampas
to
his
mind
the
meeting
with
him
was
so
providential
that
he
could
not
doubt
now
of
the
success
of
their
enterprise
the
deliverance
of
captain
grant
seemed
an
accomplished
fact
when
the
party
went
back
to
robert
the
boy
held
out
his
arms
to
the
patagonian
who
silently
laid
his
hand
on
his
head
and
proceeded
to
examine
him
with
the
greatest
care
gently
feeling
each
of
his
aching
limbs
then
he
went
down
to
the
rio
and
gathered
a
few
handfuls
of
wild
celery
which
grew
on
the
banks
with
which
he
rubbed
the
child
s
body
all
over
he
handled
him
with
the
most
exquisite
delicacy
and
his
treatment
so
revived
the
lad
s
strength
that
it
was
soon
evident
that
a
few
hours
rest
would
set
him
all
right
it
was
accordingly
decided
that
they
should
encamp
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
ensuing
night
two
grave
questions
moreover
had
to
be
settled
where
to
get
food
and
means
of
transport
provisions
and
mules
were
both
lacking
happily
they
had
thalcave
however
a
practised
guide
and
one
of
the
most
intelligent
of
his
class
he
undertook
to
find
all
that
was
needed
and
offered
to
take
him
to
a
tolderia
of
indians
not
further
than
four
miles
off
at
most
where
he
could
get
supplies
of
all
he
wanted
this
proposition
was
partly
made
by
gestures
and
partly
by
a
few
spanish
words
which
paganel
managed
to
make
out
his
offer
was
accepted
and
glenarvan
and
his
learned
friend
started
off
with
him
at
once
they
walked
at
a
good
pace
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
had
to
make
great
strides
to
keep
up
with
the
giant
thalcave
the
road
lay
through
a
beautiful
fertile
region
abounding
in
rich
pasturages
where
a
hundred
thousand
cattle
might
have
fed
comfortably
large
ponds
connected
by
an
inextricable
labyrinth
of
rios
amply
watered
these
plains
and
produced
their
greenness
swans
with
black
heads
were
disporting
in
the
water
disputing
possession
with
the
numerous
intruders
which
gamboled
over
the
llanos
the
feathered
tribes
were
of
most
brilliant
plumage
and
of
marvelous
variety
and
deafening
noise
the
isacus
a
graceful
sort
of
dove
with
gray
feathers
streaked
with
white
and
the
yellow
cardinals
were
flitting
about
in
the
trees
like
moving
flowers
while
overhead
pigeons
sparrows
chingolos
bulgueros
and
mongitas
were
flying
swiftly
along
rending
the
air
with
their
piercing
cries
paganel
s
admiration
increased
with
every
step
and
he
had
nearly
exhausted
his
vocabulary
of
adjectives
by
his
loud
exclamations
to
the
astonishment
of
the
patagonian
to
whom
the
birds
and
the
swans
and
the
prairies
were
every
day
things
the
learned
geographer
was
so
lost
in
delight
that
he
seemed
hardly
to
have
started
before
they
came
in
sight
of
the
indian
camp
or
tolderia
situated
in
the
heart
of
a
valley
about
thirty
nomadic
indians
were
living
there
in
rude
cabins
made
of
branches
pasturing
immense
herds
of
milch
cows
sheep
oxen
and
horses
they
went
from
one
prairie
to
another
always
finding
a
table
for
their
guests
these
nomads
were
a
hybrid
type
of
araucans
and
aucas
they
were
of
an
olive
tint
of
medium
stature
and
massive
form
with
a
low
forehead
almost
circular
face
thin
lips
high
cheekbones
effeminate
features
and
cold
expression
as
a
whole
they
are
about
the
least
interesting
of
the
indians
however
it
was
their
herds
glenarvan
wanted
not
themselves
as
long
as
he
could
get
beef
and
horses
he
cared
for
nothing
else
thalcave
did
the
bargaining
it
did
not
take
long
in
exchange
for
seven
ready
saddled
horses
of
the
argentine
breed
pounds
of
charqui
or
dried
meat
several
measures
of
rice
and
leather
bottles
for
water
the
indians
agreed
to
take
twenty
ounces
of
gold
as
they
could
not
get
wine
or
rum
which
they
would
have
preferred
though
they
were
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
value
of
gold
glenarvan
wished
to
purchase
an
eighth
horse
for
the
patagonian
but
he
gave
him
to
understand
that
it
would
be
useless
they
got
back
to
the
camp
in
less
than
half
an
hour
and
were
hailed
with
acclamations
by
the
whole
party
or
rather
the
provisions
and
horses
were
they
were
all
hungry
and
ate
heartily
of
the
welcome
viands
robert
took
a
little
food
with
the
rest
he
was
fast
recovering
strength
the
close
of
the
day
was
spent
in
complete
repose
and
pleasant
talk
about
the
dear
absent
ones
paganel
never
quitted
the
indian
s
side
it
was
not
that
he
was
so
glad
to
see
a
real
patagonian
by
whom
he
looked
a
perfect
pigmy
a
patagonian
who
might
have
almost
rivaled
the
emperor
maximii
and
that
congo
negro
seen
by
the
learned
van
der
brock
both
eight
feet
high
but
he
caught
up
spanish
phrases
from
the
indian
and
studied
the
language
without
a
book
this
time
gesticulating
at
a
great
rate
all
the
grand
sonorous
words
that
fell
on
his
ear
if
i
don
t
catch
the
accent
he
said
to
the
major
it
won
t
be
my
fault
but
who
would
have
said
to
me
that
it
was
a
patagonian
who
would
teach
me
spanish
one
day
chapter
xvi
the
news
of
the
lost
captain
next
day
the
of
october
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
thalcave
gave
the
signal
for
departure
between
the
and
degrees
the
argentine
soil
slopes
eastward
and
all
the
travelers
had
to
do
was
to
follow
the
slope
right
down
to
the
sea
glenarvan
had
supposed
thalcave
s
refusal
of
a
horse
was
that
he
preferred
walking
as
some
guides
do
but
he
was
mistaken
for
just
as
they
were
ready
the
patagonian
gave
a
peculiar
whistle
and
immediately
a
magnificent
steed
of
the
pure
argentine
breed
came
bounding
out
of
a
grove
close
by
at
his
master
s
call
both
in
form
and
color
the
animal
was
of
perfect
beauty
the
major
who
was
a
thorough
judge
of
all
the
good
points
of
a
horse
was
loud
in
admiration
of
this
sample
of
the
pampas
breed
and
considered
that
in
many
respects
he
greatly
resembled
an
english
hunter
this
splendid
creature
was
called
thaouka
a
word
in
patagonia
which
means
bird
and
he
well
deserved
the
name
thalcave
was
a
consummate
horseman
and
to
see
him
on
his
prancing
steed
was
a
sight
worth
looking
at
the
saddle
was
adapted
to
the
two
hunting
weapons
in
common
use
on
the
argentine
plains
the
bolas
and
the
lazo
the
bolas
consists
of
three
balls
fastened
together
by
a
strap
of
leather
attached
to
the
front
of
the
recado
the
indians
fling
them
often
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
feet
from
the
animal
or
enemy
of
which
they
are
in
pursuit
and
with
such
precision
that
they
catch
round
their
legs
and
throw
them
down
in
an
instant
it
is
a
formidable
weapon
in
their
hands
and
one
they
handle
with
surprising
skill
the
lazo
is
always
retained
in
the
hand
it
is
simply
a
rope
thirty
feet
long
made
of
tightly
twisted
leather
with
a
slip
knot
at
the
end
which
passes
through
an
iron
ring
this
noose
was
thrown
by
the
right
hand
while
the
left
keeps
fast
hold
of
the
rope
the
other
end
of
which
is
fastened
to
the
saddle
a
long
carbine
in
the
shoulder
belt
completed
the
accouterments
of
the
patagonian
he
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
party
quite
unconscious
of
the
admiration
he
was
exciting
and
they
set
off
going
alternately
at
a
gallop
and
walking
pace
for
the
trot
seemed
altogether
unknown
to
them
robert
proved
to
be
a
bold
rider
and
completely
reassured
glenarvan
as
to
his
ability
to
keep
his
seat
the
pampas
commenced
at
the
very
foot
of
the
cordilleras
they
may
be
divided
into
three
parts
the
first
extends
from
the
chain
of
the
andes
and
stretches
over
an
extent
of
miles
covered
with
stunted
trees
and
bushes
the
second
miles
is
clothed
with
magnificent
herbage
and
stops
about
miles
from
buenos
ayres
from
this
point
to
the
sea
the
foot
of
the
traveler
treads
over
immense
prairies
of
lucerne
and
thistles
which
constitute
the
third
division
of
the
pampas
on
issuing
from
the
gorges
of
the
cordilleras
glenarvan
and
his
band
came
first
to
plains
of
sand
called
medanos
lying
in
ridges
like
waves
of
the
sea
and
so
extremely
fine
that
the
least
breath
of
wind
agitated
the
light
particles
and
sent
them
flying
in
clouds
which
rose
and
fell
like
it
was
a
spectacle
which
caused
both
pleasure
and
pain
for
nothing
could
be
more
curious
than
to
see
the
said
wandering
over
the
plain
coming
in
contact
and
mingling
with
each
other
and
falling
and
rising
in
wild
confusion
but
on
the
other
hand
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
than
the
dust
which
was
thrown
off
by
these
innumerable
medanos
which
was
so
impalpable
that
close
one
s
eyes
as
they
might
it
found
its
way
through
the
lids
this
phenomenon
lasted
the
greater
part
of
the
day
the
travelers
made
good
progress
however
and
about
four
o
clock
the
cordilleras
lay
full
forty
miles
behind
them
the
dark
outlines
being
already
almost
lost
in
the
evening
mists
they
were
all
somewhat
fatigued
with
the
journey
and
glad
enough
to
halt
for
the
night
on
the
banks
of
the
neuquem
called
ramid
or
comoe
by
certain
geographers
a
troubled
turbulent
rapid
flowing
between
high
red
banks
no
incident
of
any
importance
occurred
that
night
or
the
following
day
they
rode
well
and
fast
finding
the
ground
firm
and
the
temperature
bearable
toward
noon
however
the
sun
s
rays
were
extremely
scorching
and
when
evening
came
a
bar
of
clouds
streaked
the
southwest
horizon
a
sure
sign
of
a
change
in
the
weather
the
patagonian
pointed
it
out
to
the
geographer
who
replied
yes
i
know
and
turning
to
his
companions
added
see
a
change
of
weather
is
coming
we
are
going
to
have
a
taste
of
and
he
went
on
to
explain
that
this
pampero
is
very
common
in
the
argentine
plains
it
is
an
extremely
dry
wind
which
blows
from
the
southwest
thalcave
was
not
mistaken
for
the
pampero
blew
violently
all
night
and
was
sufficiently
trying
to
poor
fellows
only
sheltered
by
their
ponchos
the
horses
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
the
men
stretched
themselves
beside
them
in
a
close
group
glenarvan
was
afraid
they
would
be
delayed
by
the
continuance
of
the
hurricane
but
paganel
was
able
to
reassure
him
on
that
score
after
consulting
his
barometer
the
pampero
generally
brings
a
tempest
which
lasts
three
days
and
may
be
always
foretold
by
the
depression
of
the
mercury
he
said
but
when
the
barometer
rises
on
the
contrary
which
is
the
case
now
all
we
need
expect
is
a
few
violent
blasts
so
you
can
make
your
mind
easy
my
good
friend
by
sunrise
the
sky
will
be
quite
clear
you
talk
like
a
book
paganel
replied
glenarvan
and
i
am
one
and
what
s
more
you
are
welcome
to
turn
over
my
leaves
whenever
you
the
book
was
right
at
one
o
clock
the
wind
suddenly
lulled
and
the
weary
men
fell
asleep
and
woke
at
daybreak
refreshed
and
invigorated
it
was
the
of
october
and
the
tenth
day
since
they
had
left
talcahuano
they
were
still
ninety
miles
from
the
point
where
the
rio
colorado
crosses
the
parallel
that
is
to
say
about
two
days
journey
glenarvan
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
appearance
of
any
indians
intending
to
question
them
through
thalcave
about
captain
grant
as
paganel
could
not
speak
to
him
well
enough
for
this
but
the
track
they
were
following
was
one
little
frequented
by
the
natives
for
the
ordinary
routes
across
the
pampas
lie
further
north
if
by
chance
some
nomadic
horseman
came
in
sight
far
away
he
was
off
again
like
a
dart
not
caring
to
enter
into
conversation
with
strangers
to
a
solitary
individual
a
little
troop
of
eight
men
all
mounted
and
well
armed
wore
a
suspicious
aspect
so
that
any
intercourse
either
with
honest
men
or
even
banditti
was
almost
impossible
glenarvan
was
regretting
this
exceedingly
when
he
unexpectedly
met
with
a
singular
justification
of
his
rendering
of
the
eventful
document
in
pursuing
the
course
the
travelers
had
laid
down
for
themselves
they
had
several
times
crossed
the
routes
over
the
plains
in
common
use
but
had
struck
into
none
of
them
hitherto
thalcave
had
made
no
remark
about
this
he
understood
quite
well
however
that
they
were
not
bound
for
any
particular
town
or
village
or
settlement
every
morning
they
set
out
in
a
straight
line
toward
the
rising
sun
and
went
on
without
the
least
deviation
moreover
it
must
have
struck
thalcave
that
instead
of
being
the
guide
he
was
guided
yet
with
true
indian
reserve
he
maintained
absolute
silence
but
on
reaching
a
particular
point
he
checked
his
horse
suddenly
and
said
to
paganel
the
carmen
yes
my
good
patagonian
replied
paganel
in
his
best
spanish
the
route
from
carmen
to
we
are
not
going
to
take
it
no
replied
paganel
where
are
we
going
then
always
to
the
that
s
going
who
knows
thalcave
was
silent
and
gazed
at
the
geographer
with
an
air
of
profound
surprise
he
had
no
suspicion
that
paganel
was
joking
for
an
indian
is
always
grave
you
are
not
going
to
carmen
then
he
added
after
a
moment
s
pause
nor
to
mendoza
no
nor
to
just
then
glenarvan
came
up
to
ask
the
reason
of
the
stoppage
and
what
he
and
thalcave
were
discussing
he
wanted
to
know
whether
we
were
going
to
carmen
or
mendoza
and
was
very
much
surprised
at
my
negative
reply
to
both
well
certainly
it
must
seem
strange
to
i
think
so
he
says
we
are
going
well
paganel
i
wonder
if
it
is
possible
to
make
him
understand
the
object
of
our
expedition
and
what
our
motive
is
for
always
going
that
would
be
a
difficult
matter
for
an
indian
knows
nothing
about
degrees
and
the
finding
of
the
document
would
appear
to
him
a
mere
fantastic
is
it
the
story
he
would
not
understand
or
the
storyteller
said
mcnabbs
quietly
ah
mcnabbs
i
see
you
have
small
faith
in
my
spanish
well
try
it
my
good
so
i
and
turning
round
to
the
patagonian
he
began
his
narrative
breaking
down
frequently
for
the
want
of
a
word
and
the
difficulty
of
making
certain
details
intelligible
to
a
indian
it
was
quite
a
sight
to
see
the
learned
geographer
he
gesticulated
and
articulated
and
so
worked
himself
up
over
it
that
the
big
drops
of
sweat
fell
in
a
cascade
down
his
forehead
on
to
his
chest
when
his
tongue
failed
his
arms
were
called
to
aid
paganel
got
down
on
the
ground
and
traced
a
geographical
map
on
the
sand
showing
where
the
lines
of
latitude
and
longitude
cross
and
where
the
two
oceans
were
along
which
the
carmen
route
led
thalcave
looked
on
composedly
without
giving
any
indication
of
comprehending
or
not
comprehending
the
lesson
had
lasted
half
an
hour
when
the
geographer
left
off
wiped
his
streaming
face
and
waited
for
the
patagonian
to
speak
does
he
understand
said
glenarvan
that
remains
to
be
seen
but
if
he
doesn
t
i
give
it
up
replied
paganel
thalcave
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
his
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
lines
drawn
on
the
sand
now
becoming
fast
effaced
by
the
wind
well
said
paganel
to
him
at
length
the
patagonian
seemed
not
to
hear
paganel
fancied
he
could
detect
an
ironical
smile
already
on
the
lips
of
the
major
and
determined
to
carry
the
day
was
about
to
recommence
his
geographical
illustrations
when
the
indian
stopped
him
by
a
gesture
and
said
you
are
in
search
of
a
prisoner
yes
replied
paganel
and
just
on
this
line
between
the
setting
and
rising
sun
added
thalcave
speaking
in
indian
fashion
of
the
route
from
west
to
east
yes
yes
that
s
and
it
s
your
god
continued
the
guide
that
has
sent
you
the
secret
of
this
prisoner
on
the
god
his
will
be
accomplished
then
replied
the
native
almost
solemnly
we
will
march
east
and
if
it
needs
be
to
the
paganel
triumphing
in
his
pupil
immediately
translated
his
replies
to
his
companions
and
exclaimed
what
an
intelligent
race
all
my
explanations
would
have
been
lost
on
nineteen
in
every
twenty
of
the
peasants
in
my
own
glenarvan
requested
him
to
ask
the
patagonian
if
he
had
heard
of
any
foreigners
who
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
indians
of
the
pampas
paganel
did
so
and
waited
an
answer
perhaps
i
the
reply
was
no
sooner
translated
than
the
patagonian
found
himself
surrounded
by
the
seven
men
questioning
him
with
eager
glances
paganel
was
so
excited
he
could
hardly
find
words
and
he
gazed
at
the
grave
indian
as
if
he
could
read
the
reply
on
his
lips
each
word
spoken
by
thalcave
was
instantly
translated
so
that
the
whole
party
seemed
to
hear
him
speak
in
their
mother
tongue
and
what
about
the
prisoner
asked
paganel
he
was
a
you
have
seen
him
no
but
i
have
heard
the
indian
speak
of
him
he
is
brave
he
has
the
heart
of
a
the
heart
of
a
bull
said
paganel
ah
this
magnificent
patagonian
language
you
understand
him
my
friends
he
means
a
courageous
my
father
exclaimed
robert
grant
and
turning
to
paganel
he
asked
what
the
spanish
was
for
is
it
my
mio
replied
the
geographer
immediately
taking
thalcave
s
hands
in
his
own
the
boy
said
in
a
soft
tone
mio
replied
the
patagonian
his
face
lighting
up
he
took
the
child
in
his
arms
lifted
him
up
on
his
horse
and
gazed
at
him
with
peculiar
sympathy
his
intelligent
face
was
full
of
quiet
feeling
but
paganel
had
not
completed
his
interrogations
this
prisoner
who
was
he
what
was
he
doing
when
had
thalcave
heard
of
him
all
these
questions
poured
upon
him
at
once
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
an
answer
and
learned
that
the
european
was
a
slave
in
one
of
the
tribes
that
roamed
the
country
between
the
colorado
and
the
rio
negro
but
where
was
the
last
place
he
was
in
with
the
cacique
in
the
line
we
have
been
following
and
who
is
this
cacique
the
chief
of
the
poyuches
indians
a
man
with
two
tongues
and
two
that
s
to
say
false
in
speech
and
false
in
action
said
paganel
after
he
had
translated
this
beautiful
figure
of
the
patagonian
language
and
can
we
deliver
our
friend
he
added
you
may
if
he
is
still
in
the
hands
of
the
and
when
did
you
last
hear
of
him
a
long
while
ago
the
sun
has
brought
two
summers
since
then
to
the
the
joy
of
glenarvan
can
not
be
described
this
reply
agreed
perfectly
with
the
date
of
the
document
but
one
question
still
remained
for
him
to
put
to
thalcave
you
spoke
of
a
prisoner
he
said
but
were
there
not
three
i
don
t
know
said
thalcave
and
you
know
nothing
of
his
present
situation
this
ended
the
conversation
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
three
men
had
become
separated
long
ago
but
still
this
much
was
certain
that
the
indians
had
spoken
of
a
european
that
was
in
their
power
and
the
date
of
the
captivity
and
even
the
descriptive
phrase
about
the
captive
evidently
pointed
to
harry
grant
chapter
xvii
a
serious
necessity
the
argentine
pampas
extend
from
the
to
the
fortieth
degree
of
southern
latitude
the
word
pampa
of
araucanian
origin
signifies
and
justly
applies
to
the
whole
region
the
mimosas
growing
on
the
western
part
and
the
substantial
herbage
on
the
eastern
give
those
plains
a
peculiar
appearance
the
soil
is
composed
of
sand
and
red
or
yellow
clay
and
this
is
covered
by
a
layer
of
earth
in
which
the
vegetation
takes
root
the
geologist
would
find
rich
treasures
in
the
tertiary
strata
here
for
it
is
full
of
antediluvian
remains
enormous
bones
which
the
indians
attribute
to
some
gigantic
race
that
lived
in
a
past
age
the
horses
went
on
at
a
good
pace
through
the
thick
the
grass
of
the
pampas
so
high
and
thick
that
the
indians
find
shelter
in
it
from
storms
at
certain
distances
but
increasingly
seldom
there
were
wet
marshy
spots
almost
entirely
under
water
where
the
willows
grew
and
a
plant
called
the
here
the
horses
drank
their
fill
greedily
as
if
bent
on
quenching
their
thirst
for
past
present
and
future
thalcave
went
first
to
beat
the
bushes
and
frighten
away
the
cholinas
a
most
dangerous
species
of
viper
the
bite
of
which
kills
an
ox
in
less
than
an
hour
for
two
days
they
plodded
steadily
across
this
arid
and
deserted
plain
the
dry
heat
became
severe
there
were
not
only
no
rios
but
even
the
ponds
dug
out
by
the
indians
were
dried
up
as
the
drought
seemed
to
increase
with
every
mile
paganel
asked
thalcave
when
he
expected
to
come
to
water
at
lake
salinas
replied
the
indian
and
when
shall
we
get
there
when
the
argentines
travel
in
the
pampas
they
generally
dig
wells
and
find
water
a
few
feet
below
the
surface
but
the
travelers
could
not
fall
back
on
this
resource
not
having
the
necessary
implements
they
were
therefore
obliged
to
husband
the
small
provision
of
water
they
had
still
left
and
deal
it
out
in
rations
so
that
if
no
one
had
enough
to
satisfy
his
thirst
no
one
felt
it
too
painful
they
halted
at
evening
after
a
course
of
thirty
miles
and
eagerly
looked
forward
to
a
good
night
s
rest
to
compensate
for
the
fatigue
of
day
but
their
slumbers
were
invaded
by
a
swarm
of
mosquitoes
which
allowed
them
no
peace
their
presence
indicated
a
change
of
wind
which
shifted
to
the
north
a
south
or
southwest
wind
generally
puts
to
flight
these
little
pests
even
these
petty
ills
of
life
could
not
ruffle
the
major
s
equanimity
but
paganel
on
the
contrary
was
perfectly
exasperated
by
such
trifling
annoyances
he
abused
the
poor
mosquitoes
desperately
and
deplored
the
lack
of
some
acid
lotion
which
would
have
eased
the
pain
of
their
stings
the
major
did
his
best
to
console
him
by
reminding
him
of
the
fact
that
they
had
only
to
do
with
one
species
of
insect
among
the
naturalists
reckon
he
would
listen
to
nothing
and
got
up
in
a
very
bad
temper
he
was
quite
willing
to
start
at
daybreak
however
for
they
had
to
get
to
lake
salinas
before
sundown
the
horses
were
tired
out
and
dying
for
water
and
though
their
riders
had
stinted
themselves
for
their
sakes
still
their
ration
was
very
insufficient
the
drought
was
constantly
increasing
and
the
heat
none
the
less
for
the
wind
being
north
this
wind
being
the
simoom
of
the
pampas
there
was
a
brief
interruption
this
day
to
the
monotony
of
the
journey
mulrady
who
was
in
front
of
the
others
rode
hastily
back
to
report
the
approach
of
a
troop
of
indians
the
news
was
received
with
very
different
feelings
by
glenarvan
and
thalcave
the
scotchman
was
glad
of
the
chance
of
gleaning
some
information
about
his
shipwrecked
countryman
while
the
patagonian
hardly
cared
to
encounter
the
nomadic
indians
of
the
prairie
knowing
their
bandit
propensities
he
rather
sought
to
avoid
them
and
gave
orders
to
his
party
to
have
their
arms
in
readiness
for
any
trouble
presently
the
nomads
came
in
sight
and
the
patagonian
was
reassured
at
finding
they
were
only
ten
in
number
they
came
within
a
hundred
yards
of
them
and
stopped
this
was
near
enough
to
observe
them
distinctly
they
were
fine
specimens
of
the
native
races
which
had
been
almost
entirely
swept
away
in
by
general
rosas
tall
in
stature
with
arched
forehead
and
olive
complexion
they
were
dressed
in
guanaco
skins
and
carried
lances
twenty
feet
long
knives
slings
bolas
and
lassos
and
by
their
dexterity
in
the
management
of
their
horses
showed
themselves
to
be
accomplished
riders
they
appeared
to
have
stopped
for
the
purpose
of
holding
a
council
with
each
other
for
they
shouted
and
gesticulated
at
a
great
rate
glenarvan
determined
to
go
up
to
them
but
he
had
no
sooner
moved
forward
than
the
whole
band
wheeled
round
and
disappeared
with
incredible
speed
it
would
have
been
useless
for
the
travelers
to
attempt
to
overtake
them
with
such
wornout
horses
the
cowards
exclaimed
paganel
they
scampered
off
too
quick
for
honest
folks
said
mcnabbs
who
are
these
indians
thalcave
asked
paganel
the
gauchos
cried
paganel
and
turning
to
his
companions
he
added
we
need
not
have
been
so
much
on
our
guard
there
was
nothing
to
how
is
that
asked
mcnabbs
because
the
gauchos
are
inoffensive
you
believe
that
paganel
certainly
i
do
they
took
us
for
robbers
and
fled
in
i
rather
think
they
did
not
dare
to
attack
us
replied
glenarvan
much
vexed
at
not
being
able
to
enter
into
some
sort
of
communication
with
those
indians
whatever
they
were
that
s
my
opinion
too
said
the
major
for
if
i
am
not
mistaken
instead
of
being
harmless
the
gauchos
are
formidable
the
idea
exclaimed
paganel
and
forthwith
commenced
a
lively
discussion
of
this
ethnological
thesis
so
lively
that
the
major
became
excited
and
quite
contrary
to
his
usual
suavity
said
bluntly
i
believe
you
are
wrong
wrong
replied
paganel
yes
thalcave
took
them
for
robbers
and
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
well
thalcave
was
mistaken
this
time
retorted
paganel
somewhat
sharply
the
gauchos
are
agriculturists
and
shepherds
and
nothing
else
as
i
have
stated
in
a
pamphlet
on
the
natives
of
the
pampas
written
by
me
which
has
attracted
some
illustration
omitted
page
intentionally
blank
well
well
you
have
committed
an
error
that
s
all
monsieur
what
monsieur
mcnabbs
you
tell
me
i
have
committed
an
error
an
inadvertence
if
you
like
which
you
can
put
among
the
errata
in
the
next
paganel
highly
incensed
at
his
geographical
knowledge
being
brought
in
question
and
even
jested
about
allowed
his
to
get
the
better
of
him
and
said
know
sir
that
my
books
have
no
need
of
such
indeed
well
on
this
occasion
they
have
at
any
rate
retorted
mcnabbs
quite
as
obstinate
as
his
opponent
sir
i
think
you
are
very
annoying
and
i
think
you
are
very
glenarvan
thought
it
was
high
time
to
interfere
for
the
discussion
was
getting
too
hot
so
he
said
come
now
there
is
no
doubt
one
of
you
is
very
teasing
and
the
other
is
very
crabbed
and
i
must
say
i
am
surprised
at
both
of
the
patagonian
without
understanding
the
cause
could
see
that
the
two
friends
were
quarreling
he
began
to
smile
and
said
quietly
it
s
the
north
the
north
wind
exclaimed
paganel
what
s
the
north
wind
to
do
with
it
ah
it
is
just
that
said
glenarvan
it
s
the
north
wind
that
has
put
you
in
a
bad
temper
i
have
heard
that
in
south
america
the
wind
greatly
irritates
the
nervous
by
patrick
edward
you
are
right
said
the
major
laughing
heartily
but
paganel
in
a
towering
rage
would
not
give
up
the
contest
and
turned
upon
glenarvan
whose
intervention
in
this
jesting
manner
he
resented
and
so
my
lord
my
nervous
system
is
irritated
he
said
yes
paganel
it
is
the
north
wind
a
wind
which
causes
many
a
crime
in
the
pampas
as
the
tramontane
does
in
the
campagna
of
crimes
returned
the
geographer
do
i
look
like
a
man
that
would
commit
crimes
that
s
not
exactly
what
i
tell
me
at
once
that
i
want
to
assassinate
you
well
i
am
really
afraid
replied
glenarvan
bursting
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
in
which
all
others
joined
paganel
said
no
more
but
went
off
in
front
alone
and
came
back
in
a
few
minutes
quite
himself
as
if
he
had
completely
forgotten
his
grievance
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
thalcave
who
was
considerably
in
advance
of
the
rest
descried
in
the
distance
the
lake
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
reached
its
banks
but
a
grievous
disappointment
awaited
them
the
lake
was
dried
up
chapter

in
search
of
water
lake
salinas
ends
the
string
of

connected

ventana
and
guamini
numerous
expeditions
were
formerly
made
there
from
buenos
ayres
to
collect
the
salt
deposited
on
its
banks
as
the
waters
contain
great
quantities
of
chloride
of
sodium
but
when
thalcave
spoke
of
the
lake
as
supplying
drinkable
water
he
was
thinking
of
the
rios
of
fresh
water
which
run
into
it
those
streams
however
were
all
dried
up
also
the
burning
sun
had
drunk
up
every
thing
liquid
and
the
consternation
of
the
travelers
may
be
imagined
at
the
discovery
some
action
must
be
taken
immediately
however
for
what
little
water
still
remained
was
almost
bad
and
could
not
quench
thirst
hunger
and
fatigue
were
forgotten
in
the
face
of
this
imperious
necessity
a
sort
of
leather
tent
called
a
roukah
which
had
been
left
by
the
natives
afforded
the
party
a
temporary
and
the
weary
horses
stretched
themselves
along
the
muddy
banks
and
tried
to
browse
on
the
marine
plants
and
dry
reeds
they
found
there
nauseous
to
the
taste
as
they
must
have
been
as
soon
as
the
whole
party
were
ensconced
in
the
roukah
paganel
asked
thalcave
what
he
thought
was
best
to
be
done
a
rapid
conversation
followed
a
few
words
of
which
were
intelligible
to
glenarvan
thalcave
spoke
calmly
but
the
lively
frenchman
gesticulated
enough
for
both
after
a
little
thalcave
sat
silent
and
folded
his
arms
what
does
he
say
asked
glenarvan
i
fancied
he
was
advising
us
to
yes
into
two
parties
those
of
us
whose
horses
are
so
done
out
with
fatigue
and
thirst
that
they
can
scarcely
drag
one
leg
after
the
other
are
to
continue
the
route
as
they
best
can
while
the
others
whose
steeds
are
fresher
are
to
push
on
in
advance
toward
the
river
guamini
which
throws
itself
into
lake
san
lucas
about
miles
off
if
there
should
be
water
enough
in
the
river
they
are
to
wait
on
the
banks
till
their
companions
reach
them
but
should
it
be
dried
up
they
will
hasten
back
and
spare
them
a
useless
and
what
will
we
do
then
asked
austin
then
we
shall
have
to
make
up
our
minds
to
go
miles
south
as
far
as
the
commencement
of
the
sierra
ventana
where
rivers
it
is
wise
counsel
and
we
will
act
upon
it
without
loss
of
time
my
horse
is
in
tolerable
good
trim
and
i
volunteer
to
accompany
oh
my
lord
take
me
said
robert
as
if
it
were
a
question
of
some
pleasure
party
but
would
you
be
able
for
it
my
boy
oh
i
have
a
fine
beast
which
just
wants
to
have
a
gallop
please
my
lord
to
take
come
then
my
boy
said
glenarvan
delighted
not
to
leave
robert
behind
if
we
three
don
t
manage
to
find
out
fresh
water
somewhere
he
added
we
must
be
very
well
well
and
what
about
me
said
paganel
oh
my
dear
paganel
you
must
stay
with
the
reserve
corps
replied
the
major
you
are
too
well
acquainted
with
the
parallel
and
the
river
guamini
and
the
whole
pampas
for
us
to
let
you
go
neither
mulrady
nor
wilson
nor
myself
would
be
able
to
rejoin
thalcave
at
the
given
rendezvous
but
we
will
put
ourselves
under
the
banner
of
the
brave
jacques
paganel
with
perfect
i
resign
myself
said
the
geographer
much
flattered
at
having
supreme
command
but
mind
paganel
no
distractions
added
the
major
don
t
you
take
us
to
the
wrong
place
to
the
borders
of
the
pacific
for
oh
you
insufferable
major
it
would
serve
you
right
replied
paganel
laughing
but
how
will
you
manage
to
understand
what
thalcave
says
glenarvan
he
continued
i
suppose
replied
glenarvan
the
patagonian
and
i
won
t
have
much
to
talk
about
besides
i
know
a
few
spanish
words
and
at
a
pinch
i
should
not
fear
either
making
him
understand
me
or
my
understanding
go
then
my
worthy
friend
said
paganel
we
ll
have
supper
first
rejoined
glenarvan
and
then
sleep
if
we
can
till
it
is
starting
the
supper
was
not
very
reviving
without
drink
of
any
kind
and
they
tried
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
it
by
a
good
sleep
but
paganel
dreamed
of
water
all
night
of
torrents
and
cascades
and
rivers
and
ponds
and
streams
and
brooks
in
fact
he
had
a
complete
nightmare
next
morning
at
six
o
clock
the
horses
of
thalcave
glenarvan
and
robert
were
got
ready
their
last
ration
of
water
was
given
them
and
drunk
with
more
avidity
than
satisfaction
for
it
was
filthy
disgusting
stuff
the
three
travelers
then
jumped
into
their
saddles
and
set
off
shouting
revoir
to
their
companions
don
t
come
back
whatever
you
do
called
paganel
after
them
the
de
las
which
they
had
to
traverse
is
a
dry
plain
covered
with
stunted
trees
not
above
ten
feet
high
and
small
mimosas
which
the
indians
call
and
jumes
a
bushy
shrub
rich
in
soda
here
and
there
large
spaces
were
covered
with
salt
which
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
with
astonishing
brilliancy
these
might
easily
have
been
taken
for
sheets
of
ice
had
not
the
intense
heat
forbidden
the
illusion
and
the
contrast
these
dazzling
white
sheets
presented
to
the
dry
ground
gave
the
desert
a
most
peculiar
character
eighty
miles
south
on
the
contrary
the
sierra
ventana
toward
which
the
travelers
might
possibly
have
to
betake
themselves
should
the
guamini
disappoint
their
hopes
the
landscape
was
totally
different
there
the
fertility
is
splendid
the
pasturage
is
incomparable
unfortunately
to
reach
them
would
necessitate
a
march
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
south
and
this
was
why
thalcave
thought
it
best
to
go
first
to
guamini
as
it
was
not
only
much
nearer
but
also
on
the
direct
line
of
route
the
three
horses
went
forward
might
and
main
as
if
instinctively
knowing
whither
they
were
bound
thaouka
especially
displayed
a
courage
that
neither
fatigue
nor
hunger
could
damp
he
bounded
like
a
bird
over
the
canadas
and
the
bushes
of
his
loud
joyous
neighing
seeming
to
bode
success
to
the
search
the
horses
of
glenarvan
and
robert
though
not
so
felt
the
spur
of
his
example
and
followed
him
bravely
thalcave
inspirited
his
companions
as
much
as
thaouka
did
his
brethren
he
sat
motionless
in
the
saddle
but
often
turned
his
head
to
look
at
robert
and
ever
and
anon
gave
him
a
shout
of
encouragement
and
approval
as
he
saw
how
well
he
rode
certainly
the
boy
deserved
praise
for
he
was
fast
becoming
an
excellent
cavalier
bravo
robert
said
glenarvan
thalcave
is
evidently
congratulating
you
my
boy
and
paying
you
what
for
my
lord
for
your
good
i
can
hold
firm
on
that
s
all
replied
robert
blushing
with
pleasure
at
such
an
encomium
that
is
the
principal
thing
robert
but
you
are
too
modest
i
tell
you
that
some
day
you
will
turn
out
an
accomplished
what
would
papa
say
to
that
said
robert
laughing
he
wants
me
to
be
a
the
one
won
t
hinder
the
other
if
all
cavaliers
wouldn
t
make
good
sailors
there
is
no
reason
why
all
sailors
should
not
make
good
horsemen
to
keep
one
s
footing
on
the
yards
must
teach
a
man
to
hold
on
firm
and
as
to
managing
the
reins
and
making
a
horse
go
through
all
sorts
of
movements
that
s
easily
acquired
indeed
it
comes
poor
father
said
robert
how
he
will
thank
you
for
saving
his
you
love
him
very
much
robert
yes
my
lord
dearly
he
was
so
good
to
me
and
my
sister
we
were
his
only
thought
and
whenever
he
came
home
from
his
voyages
we
were
sure
of
some
souvenir
from
all
the
places
he
had
been
to
and
better
still
of
loving
words
and
caresses
ah
if
you
knew
him
you
would
love
him
too
mary
is
most
like
him
he
has
a
soft
voice
like
hers
that
s
strange
for
a
sailor
isn
t
it
yes
robert
very
i
see
him
still
the
boy
went
on
as
if
speaking
to
himself
good
brave
papa
he
put
me
to
sleep
on
his
knee
crooning
an
old
scotch
ballad
about
the
lochs
of
our
country
the
time
sometimes
comes
back
to
me
but
very
confused
like
so
it
does
to
mary
too
ah
my
lord
how
we
loved
him
well
i
do
think
one
needs
to
be
little
to
love
one
s
father
like
yes
and
to
be
grown
up
my
child
to
venerate
him
replied
glenarvan
deeply
touched
by
the
boy
s
genuine
affection
during
this
conversation
the
horses
had
been
slackening
speed
and
were
only
walking
now
you
will
find
him
said
robert
again
after
a
few
minutes
silence
yes
we
ll
find
him
was
glenarvan
s
reply
thalcave
has
set
us
on
the
track
and
i
have
great
confidence
in
thalcave
is
a
brave
indian
isn
t
he
said
the
boy
that
indeed
he
do
you
know
something
my
lord
what
is
it
and
then
i
will
tell
you
that
all
the
people
you
have
with
you
are
brave
lady
helena
whom
i
love
so
and
the
major
with
his
calm
manner
and
captain
mangles
and
monsieur
paganel
and
all
the
sailors
on
the
duncan
how
courageous
and
devoted
they
yes
my
boy
i
know
that
replied
glenarvan
and
do
you
know
that
you
are
the
best
of
no
most
certainly
i
don
t
know
well
it
is
time
you
did
my
lord
said
the
boy
seizing
his
lordship
s
hand
and
covering
it
with
kisses
glenarvan
shook
his
head
but
said
no
more
as
a
gesture
from
thalcave
made
them
spur
on
their
horses
and
hurry
forward
but
it
was
soon
evident
that
with
the
exception
of
thaouka
the
wearied
animals
could
not
go
quicker
than
a
walking
pace
at
noon
they
were
obliged
to
let
them
rest
for
an
hour
they
could
not
go
on
at
all
and
refused
to
eat
the
alfafares
a
poor
sort
of
lucerne
that
grew
there
glenarvan
began
to
be
uneasy
tokens
of
sterility
were
not
the
least
on
the
decrease
and
the
want
of
water
might
involve
serious
calamities
thalcave
said
nothing
thinking
probably
that
it
would
be
time
enough
to
despair
if
the
guamini
should
be
dried
up
if
indeed
the
heart
of
an
indian
can
ever
despair
spur
and
whip
had
both
to
be
employed
to
induce
the
poor
animals
to
resume
the
route
and
then
they
only
crept
along
for
their
strength
was
gone
thaouka
indeed
could
have
galloped
swiftly
enough
and
reached
the
rio
in
a
few
hours
but
thalcave
would
not
leave
his
companions
behind
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
it
was
hard
work
however
to
get
the
animal
to
consent
to
walk
quietly
he
kicked
and
reared
and
neighed
violently
and
was
subdued
at
last
more
by
his
master
s
voice
than
hand
thalcave
positively
talked
to
the
beast
and
thaouka
understood
perfectly
though
unable
to
reply
for
after
a
great
deal
of
arguing
the
noble
creature
yielded
though
he
still
champed
the
bit
thalcave
did
not
understand
thaouka
it
turned
out
though
thaouka
understood
him
the
intelligent
animal
felt
humidity
in
the
atmosphere
and
drank
it
in
with
frenzy
moving
and
making
a
noise
with
his
tongue
as
if
taking
deep
draughts
of
some
cool
refreshing
liquid
the
patagonian
could
not
mistake
him
now
water
was
not
far
off
the
two
other
horses
seemed
to
catch
their
comrade
s
meaning
and
inspired
by
his
example
made
a
last
effort
and
galloped
forward
after
the
indian
about
three
o
clock
a
white
line
appeared
in
a
dip
of
the
road
and
seemed
to
tremble
in
the
sunlight
water
exclaimed
glenarvan
yes
yes
it
is
water
shouted
robert
they
were
right
and
the
horses
knew
it
too
for
there
was
no
need
now
to
urge
them
on
they
tore
over
the
ground
as
if
mad
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
reached
the
river
and
plunged
in
up
to
their
chests
their
masters
had
to
go
on
too
whether
they
would
or
not
but
they
were
so
rejoiced
at
being
able
to
quench
their
thirst
that
this
compulsory
bath
was
no
grievance
oh
how
delicious
this
is
exclaimed
robert
taking
a
deep
draught
drink
moderately
my
boy
said
glenarvan
but
he
did
not
set
the
example
thalcave
drank
very
quietly
without
hurrying
himself
taking
small
gulps
but
as
long
as
a
lazo
as
the
patagonians
say
he
seemed
as
if
he
were
never
going
to
leave
off
and
really
there
was
some
danger
of
his
swallowing
up
the
whole
river
at
last
glenarvan
said
well
our
friends
won
t
be
disappointed
this
time
they
will
be
sure
of
finding
clear
cool
water
when
they
get
here
that
is
to
say
if
thalcave
leaves
any
for
but
couldn
t
we
go
to
meet
them
it
would
spare
them
several
hours
suffering
and
you
re
right
my
boy
but
how
could
we
carry
them
this
water
the
leather
bottles
were
left
with
wilson
no
it
is
better
for
us
to
wait
for
them
as
we
agreed
they
can
t
be
here
till
about
the
middle
of
the
night
so
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
get
a
good
bed
and
a
good
supper
ready
for
thalcave
had
not
waited
for
glenarvan
s
proposition
to
prepare
an
encampment
he
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
discover
on
the
banks
of
the
a
a
sort
of
enclosure
which
had
served
as
a
fold
for
flocks
and
was
shut
in
on
three
sides
a
more
suitable
place
could
not
be
found
for
their
night
s
lodging
provided
they
had
no
fear
of
sleeping
in
the
open
air
beneath
the
heavens
and
none
of
thalcave
s
companions
had
much
solicitude
on
that
score
accordingly
they
took
possession
at
once
and
stretched
themselves
at
full
length
on
the
ground
in
the
bright
sunshine
to
dry
their
dripping
garments
well
now
we
ve
secured
a
lodging
we
must
think
of
supper
said
glenarvan
our
friends
must
not
have
reason
to
complain
of
the
couriers
they
sent
to
precede
them
and
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
they
will
be
very
satisfied
it
strikes
me
that
an
hour
s
shooting
won
t
be
lost
time
are
you
ready
robert
yes
my
lord
replied
the
boy
standing
up
gun
in
hand
why
glenarvan
proposed
this
was
that
the
banks
of
the
guamini
seemed
to
be
the
general
rendezvous
of
all
the
game
in
the
surrounding
plains
a
sort
of
partridge
peculiar
to
the
pampas
called
tinamous
black
a
species
of
plover
called
yellow
rays
and
waterfowl
with
magnificent
green
plumage
rose
in
coveys
no
quadrupeds
however
were
visible
but
thalcave
pointed
to
the
long
grass
and
thick
brushwood
and
gave
his
friends
to
understand
they
were
lying
there
in
concealment
disdaining
the
feathered
tribes
when
more
substantial
game
was
at
hand
the
hunters
first
shots
were
fired
into
the
underwood
instantly
there
rose
by
the
hundred
roebucks
and
guanacos
like
those
that
had
swept
over
them
that
terrible
night
on
the
cordilleras
but
the
timid
creatures
were
so
frightened
that
they
were
all
out
of
gunshot
in
a
twinkling
the
hunters
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
humbler
game
though
in
an
alimentary
point
of
view
nothing
better
could
be
wished
a
dozen
of
red
partridges
and
rays
were
speedily
brought
down
and
glenarvan
also
managed
very
cleverly
to
kill
a
or
peccary
a
pachydermatous
animal
the
flesh
of
which
is
excellent
eating
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
hunters
had
all
the
game
they
required
robert
had
killed
a
curious
animal
belonging
to
the
order
edentata
an
armadillo
a
sort
of
tatou
covered
with
a
hard
bony
shell
in
movable
pieces
and
measuring
a
foot
and
a
half
long
it
was
very
fat
and
would
make
an
excellent
dish
the
patagonian
said
robert
was
very
proud
of
his
success
thalcave
did
his
part
by
capturing
a
nandou
a
species
of
ostrich
remarkable
for
its
extreme
swiftness
there
could
be
no
entrapping
such
an
animal
and
the
indian
did
not
attempt
it
he
urged
thaouka
to
a
gallop
and
made
a
direct
attack
knowing
that
if
the
first
aim
missed
the
nandou
would
soon
tire
out
horse
and
rider
by
involving
them
in
an
inextricable
labyrinth
of
windings
the
moment
therefore
that
thalcave
got
to
a
right
distance
he
flung
his
bolas
with
such
a
powerful
hand
and
so
skillfully
that
he
caught
the
bird
round
the
legs
and
paralyzed
his
efforts
at
once
in
a
few
seconds
it
lay
flat
on
the
ground
the
indian
had
not
made
his
capture
for
the
mere
pleasure
and
glory
of
such
a
novel
chase
the
flesh
of
the
nandou
is
highly
esteemed
and
thalcave
felt
bound
to
contribute
his
share
of
the
common
repast
they
returned
to
the
ramada
bringing
back
the
string
of
partridges
the
ostrich
the
peccary
and
the
armadillo
the
ostrich
and
the
peccary
were
prepared
for
cooking
by
divesting
them
of
their
tough
skins
and
cutting
them
up
into
thin
slices
as
to
the
armadillo
he
carries
his
cooking
apparatus
with
him
and
all
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
place
him
in
his
own
shell
over
the
glowing
embers
the
substantial
dishes
were
reserved
for
the
and
the
three
hunters
contented
themselves
with
devouring
the
partridges
and
washed
down
their
meal
with
clear
fresh
water
which
was
pronounced
superior
to
all
the
porter
in
the
world
even
to
the
famous
highland
usquebaugh
or
whisky
the
horses
had
not
been
overlooked
a
large
quantity
of
dry
fodder
was
discovered
lying
heaped
up
in
the
ramada
and
this
supplied
them
amply
with
both
food
and
bedding
when
all
was
ready
the
three
companions
wrapped
themselves
in
the
ponchos
and
stretched
themselves
on
an
eiderdown
of
alfafares
the
usual
bed
of
hunters
on
the
pampas
chapter

the
red
wolves
night
came
but
the
orb
of
night
was
invisible
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
for
she
was
just
in
her
first
quarter
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
was
all
that
illumined
the
plain
the
waters
of
the
guamini
ran
silently
like
a
sheet
of
oil
over
a
surface
of
marble
birds
quadrupeds
and
reptiles
were
resting
motionless
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
the
silence
of
the
desert
brooded
over
the
pampas
glenarvan
robert
and
thalcave
had
followed
the
common
example
and
lay
in
profound
slumber
on
their
soft
couch
of
lucerne
the
horses
had
stretched
themselves
full
length
on
the
ground
except
thaouka
who
slept
standing
true
to
his
high
blood
proud
in
repose
as
in
action
and
ready
to
start
at
his
master
s
call
absolute
silence
reigned
within
the
inclosure
over
which
the
dying
embers
of
the
fire
shed
a
fitful
light
however
the
indian
s
sleep
did
not
last
long
for
about
ten
o
clock
he
woke
sat
up
and
turned
his
ear
toward
the
plain
listening
intently
with
eyes
an
uneasy
look
began
to
depict
itself
on
his
usually
impassive
face
had
he
caught
scent
of
some
party
of
indian
marauders
or
of
jaguars
water
tigers
and
other
terrible
animals
that
haunt
the
neighborhood
of
rivers
apparently
it
was
the
latter
for
he
threw
a
rapid
glance
on
the
combustible
materials
heaped
up
in
the
inclosure
and
the
expression
of
anxiety
on
his
countenance
seemed
to
deepen
this
was
not
surprising
as
the
whole
pile
of
alfafares
would
soon
burn
out
and
could
only
ward
off
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
for
a
brief
interval
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
circumstances
but
wait
and
wait
he
did
in
a
posture
his
head
leaning
on
his
hands
and
his
elbows
on
his
knees
like
a
man
roused
suddenly
from
his
night
s
sleep
a
whole
hour
passed
and
anyone
except
thalcave
would
have
lain
down
again
on
his
couch
reassured
by
the
silence
round
him
but
where
a
stranger
would
have
suspected
nothing
the
sharpened
senses
of
the
indian
detected
the
approach
of
danger
as
he
was
thus
watching
and
listening
thaouka
gave
a
low
neigh
and
stretched
his
nostrils
toward
the
entrance
of
the
ramada
this
startled
the
patagonian
and
made
him
rise
to
his
feet
at
once
thaouka
scents
an
enemy
he
said
to
himself
going
toward
the
opening
to
make
careful
survey
of
the
plains
silence
still
prevailed
but
not
tranquillity
for
thalcave
caught
a
glimpse
of
shadows
moving
noiselessly
over
the
tufts
of
here
and
there
luminous
spots
appeared
dying
out
and
rekindling
constantly
in
all
directions
like
fantastic
lights
dancing
over
the
surface
of
an
immense
lagoon
an
inexperienced
eye
might
have
mistaken
them
for
fireflies
which
shine
at
night
in
many
parts
of
the
pampas
but
thalcave
was
not
deceived
he
knew
the
enemies
he
had
to
deal
with
and
lost
no
time
in
loading
his
carbine
and
taking
up
his
post
in
front
of
the
fence
he
did
not
wait
long
for
a
strange
cry
a
confused
sound
of
barking
and
howling
broke
over
the
pampas
followed
next
instant
by
the
report
of
the
carbine
which
made
the
uproar
a
hundred
times
worse
glenarvan
and
robert
woke
in
alarm
and
started
to
their
feet
instantly
what
is
it
exclaimed
robert
is
it
the
indians
asked
glenarvan
no
replied
thalcave
the
aguaras
said
robert
looking
inquiringly
at
glenarvan
yes
replied
glenarvan
the
red
wolves
of
the
they
seized
their
weapons
at
once
and
stationed
themselves
beside
the
patagonian
who
pointed
toward
the
plain
from
whence
the
yelling
resounded
robert
drew
back
involuntarily
you
are
not
afraid
of
wolves
my
boy
said
glenarvan
no
my
lord
said
the
lad
in
a
firm
tone
and
moreover
beside
you
i
am
afraid
of
so
much
the
better
these
aguaras
are
not
very
formidable
either
and
if
it
were
not
for
their
number
i
should
not
give
them
a
never
mind
we
are
all
well
armed
let
them
we
ll
certainly
give
them
a
warm
reception
rejoined
glenarvan
his
lordship
only
spoke
thus
to
reassure
the
child
for
a
secret
terror
filled
him
at
the
sight
of
this
legion
of
bloodthirsty
animals
let
loose
on
them
at
midnight
there
might
possibly
be
some
hundreds
and
what
could
three
men
do
even
armed
to
the
teeth
against
such
a
multitude
as
soon
as
thalcave
said
the
word
aguara
glenarvan
knew
that
he
meant
the
red
wolf
for
this
is
the
name
given
to
it
by
the
pampas
indians
this
voracious
animal
called
by
naturalists
the
is
in
shape
like
a
large
dog
and
has
the
head
of
a
fox
its
fur
is
a
color
and
there
is
a
black
mane
all
down
the
back
it
is
a
strong
nimble
animal
generally
inhabiting
marshy
places
and
pursuing
aquatic
animals
by
swimming
prowling
about
by
night
and
sleeping
during
the
day
its
attacks
are
particularly
dreaded
at
the
estancias
or
sheep
stations
as
it
often
commits
considerable
ravages
carrying
off
the
finest
of
the
flock
singly
the
aguara
is
not
much
to
be
feared
but
they
generally
go
in
immense
packs
and
one
had
better
have
to
deal
with
a
jaguar
or
cougar
than
with
them
both
from
the
noise
of
the
howling
and
the
multitude
of
shadows
leaping
about
glenarvan
had
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
number
of
the
wolves
and
he
knew
they
had
scented
a
good
meal
of
human
flesh
or
horse
flesh
and
none
of
them
would
go
back
to
their
dens
without
a
share
it
was
certainly
a
very
alarming
situation
to
be
in
the
assailants
were
gradually
drawing
closer
the
horses
displayed
signs
of
the
liveliest
terror
with
the
exception
of
thaouka
who
stamped
his
foot
and
tried
to
break
loose
and
get
out
his
master
could
only
calm
him
by
keeping
up
a
low
continuous
whistle
glenarvan
and
robert
had
posted
themselves
so
as
to
defend
the
opening
of
the
ramada
they
were
just
going
to
fire
into
the
nearest
ranks
of
the
wolves
when
thalcave
lowered
their
weapons
what
does
thalcave
mean
asked
robert
he
forbids
our
and
why
perhaps
he
thinks
it
is
not
the
right
but
this
was
not
the
indian
s
reason
and
so
glenarvan
saw
when
he
lifted
the
showed
him
it
was
nearly
empty
what
s
wrong
asked
robert
we
must
husband
our
ammunition
was
the
reply
s
shooting
has
cost
us
dear
and
we
are
short
of
powder
and
shot
we
can
t
fire
more
than
twenty
the
boy
made
no
reply
and
glenarvan
asked
him
if
he
was
frightened
no
my
lord
he
said
that
s
right
returned
glenarvan
a
fresh
report
resounded
that
instant
thalcave
had
made
short
work
of
one
assailant
more
audacious
than
the
rest
and
the
infuriated
pack
had
retreated
to
within
a
hundred
steps
of
the
inclosure
on
a
sign
from
the
indian
glenarvan
took
his
place
while
thalcave
went
back
into
the
inclosure
and
gathered
up
all
the
dried
grass
and
alfafares
and
indeed
all
the
combustibles
he
could
rake
together
and
made
a
pile
of
them
at
the
entrance
into
this
he
flung
one
of
the
embers
and
soon
the
bright
flames
shot
up
into
the
dark
night
glenarvan
could
now
get
a
good
glimpse
of
his
antagonists
and
saw
that
it
was
impossible
to
exaggerate
their
numbers
or
their
fury
the
barrier
of
fire
just
raised
by
thalcave
had
redoubled
their
anger
though
it
had
cut
off
their
approach
several
of
them
however
urged
on
by
the
hindmost
ranks
pushed
forward
into
the
very
flames
and
burned
their
paws
for
their
pains
from
time
to
time
another
shot
had
to
be
fired
notwithstanding
the
fire
to
keep
off
the
howling
pack
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
fifteen
dead
animals
lay
stretched
on
the
prairie
the
situation
of
the
besieged
was
relatively
speaking
less
dangerous
now
as
long
as
the
powder
lasted
and
the
barrier
of
fire
burned
on
there
was
no
fear
of
being
overmastered
but
what
was
to
be
done
afterward
when
both
means
of
defense
failed
at
once
glenarvan
s
heart
swelled
as
he
looked
at
robert
he
forgot
himself
in
thinking
of
this
poor
child
as
he
saw
him
showing
a
courage
so
far
above
his
years
robert
was
pale
but
he
kept
his
gun
steady
and
stood
with
firm
foot
ready
to
meet
the
attacks
of
the
infuriated
wolves
however
after
glenarvan
had
calmly
surveyed
the
actual
state
of
affairs
he
determined
to
bring
things
to
a
crisis
in
an
hour
s
time
he
said
we
shall
neither
have
powder
nor
fire
it
will
never
do
to
wait
till
then
before
we
settle
what
to
accordingly
he
went
up
to
thalcave
and
tried
to
talk
to
him
by
the
help
of
the
few
spanish
words
his
memory
could
muster
though
their
conversation
was
often
interrupted
by
one
or
the
other
having
to
fire
a
shot
it
was
no
easy
task
for
the
two
men
to
understand
each
other
but
most
fortunately
glenarvan
knew
a
great
deal
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
red
wolf
otherwise
he
could
never
have
interpreted
the
indian
s
words
and
gestures
as
it
was
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
could
get
any
answer
from
thalcave
to
tell
robert
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
what
does
he
say
he
says
that
at
any
price
we
must
hold
out
till
daybreak
the
aguara
only
prowls
about
at
night
and
goes
back
to
his
lair
with
the
first
streak
of
dawn
it
is
a
cowardly
beast
that
loves
the
darkness
and
dreads
the
light
an
owl
on
four
very
well
let
us
defend
ourselves
then
till
yes
my
boy
and
with
when
gun
and
shots
already
thalcave
had
set
the
example
for
whenever
a
wolf
came
too
near
the
burning
pile
the
long
arm
of
the
patagonian
dashed
through
the
flames
and
came
out
again
reddened
with
blood
but
very
soon
this
means
of
defense
would
be
at
an
end
about
two
o
clock
thalcave
flung
his
last
armful
of
combustibles
into
the
fire
and
barely
enough
powder
remained
to
load
a
gun
five
times
glenarvan
threw
a
sorrowful
glance
round
him
he
thought
of
the
lad
standing
there
and
of
his
companions
and
those
left
behind
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
robert
was
silent
perhaps
the
danger
seemed
less
imminent
to
his
imagination
but
glenarvan
thought
for
him
and
pictured
to
himself
the
horrible
fate
that
seemed
to
await
him
inevitably
quite
overcome
by
his
emotion
he
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
straining
him
convulsively
to
his
heart
pressed
his
lips
on
his
forehead
while
tears
he
could
not
restrain
streamed
down
his
cheeks
robert
looked
up
into
his
face
with
a
smile
and
said
i
am
not
no
my
child
no
and
you
are
right
in
two
hours
daybreak
will
come
and
we
shall
be
saved
bravo
thalcave
my
brave
patagonian
bravo
he
added
as
the
indian
that
moment
leveled
two
enormous
beasts
who
endeavored
to
leap
across
the
barrier
of
flames
but
the
fire
was
fast
dying
out
and
the
denouement
of
the
terrible
drama
was
approaching
the
flames
got
lower
and
lower
once
more
the
shadows
of
night
fell
on
the
prairie
and
the
glaring
eyes
of
the
wolves
glowed
like
phosphorescent
balls
in
the
darkness
a
few
minutes
longer
and
the
whole
pack
would
be
in
the
inclosure
thalcave
loaded
his
carbine
for
the
last
time
killed
one
more
enormous
monster
and
then
folded
his
arms
his
head
sank
on
his
chest
and
he
appeared
buried
in
deep
thought
was
he
planning
some
daring
impossible
mad
attempt
to
repulse
the
infuriated
horde
glenarvan
did
not
venture
to
ask
at
this
very
moment
the
wolves
began
to
change
their
tactics
the
deafening
howls
suddenly
ceased
they
seemed
to
be
going
away
gloomy
silence
spread
over
the
prairie
and
made
robert
exclaim
they
re
gone
but
thalcave
guessing
his
meaning
shook
his
head
he
knew
they
would
never
relinquish
their
sure
prey
till
daybreak
made
them
hasten
back
to
their
dens
still
their
plan
of
attack
had
evidently
been
altered
they
no
longer
attempted
to
force
the
entrance
but
their
new
maneuvers
only
heightened
the
danger
they
had
gone
round
the
ramada
as
by
common
consent
and
were
trying
to
get
in
on
the
opposite
side
the
next
minute
they
heard
their
claws
attacking
the
moldering
wood
and
already
formidable
paws
and
hungry
savage
jaws
had
found
their
way
through
the
palings
the
terrified
horses
broke
loose
from
their
halters
and
ran
about
the
inclosure
mad
with
fear
glenarvan
put
his
arms
round
the
young
lad
and
resolved
to
defend
him
as
long
as
his
life
held
out
possibly
he
might
have
made
a
useless
attempt
at
flight
when
his
eye
fell
on
thalcave
the
indian
had
been
stalking
about
the
ramada
like
a
stag
when
he
suddenly
stopped
short
and
going
up
to
his
horse
who
was
trembling
with
impatience
began
to
saddle
him
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
without
forgetting
a
single
strap
or
buckle
he
seemed
no
longer
to
disturb
himself
in
the
least
about
the
wolves
outside
though
their
yells
had
redoubled
in
intensity
a
dark
suspicion
crossed
glenarvan
s
mind
as
he
watched
him
he
is
going
to
desert
us
he
exclaimed
at
last
as
he
saw
him
seize
the
reins
as
if
preparing
to
mount
he
never
replied
robert
instead
of
deserting
them
the
truth
was
that
the
indian
was
going
to
try
and
save
his
friends
by
sacrificing
himself
thaouka
was
ready
and
stood
champing
his
bit
he
reared
up
and
his
splendid
eyes
flashed
fire
he
understood
his
master
but
just
as
the
patagonian
caught
hold
of
the
horse
s
mane
glenarvan
seized
his
arm
with
a
convulsive
grip
and
said
pointing
to
the
open
prairie
you
are
going
away
yes
replied
the
indian
understanding
his
gesture
then
he
said
a
few
words
in
spanish
which
meant
good
horse
quick
will
draw
all
the
wolves
away
after
oh
thalcave
exclaimed
glenarvan
quick
quick
replied
the
indian
while
glenarvan
said
in
a
broken
agitated
voice
to
robert
robert
my
child
do
you
hear
him
he
wants
to
sacrifice
himself
for
us
he
wants
to
rush
away
over
the
pampas
and
turn
off
the
wolves
from
us
by
attracting
them
to
friend
thalcave
returned
robert
throwing
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
patagonian
friend
thalcave
don
t
leave
us
no
said
glenarvan
he
shall
not
leave
and
turning
toward
the
indian
he
said
pointing
to
the
frightened
horses
let
us
go
no
replied
thalcave
catching
his
meaning
bad
beasts
frightened
thaouka
good
be
it
so
then
returned
glenarvan
thalcave
will
not
leave
you
robert
he
teaches
me
what
i
must
do
it
is
for
me
to
go
and
for
him
to
stay
by
then
seizing
thaouka
s
bridle
he
said
i
am
going
thalcave
not
no
replied
the
patagonian
quietly
i
am
exclaimed
glenarvan
snatching
the
bridle
out
of
his
hands
i
myself
save
this
boy
thalcave
i
commit
him
to
glenarvan
was
so
excited
that
he
mixed
up
english
words
with
his
spanish
but
what
mattered
the
language
at
such
a
terrible
moment
a
gesture
was
enough
the
two
men
understood
each
other
however
thalcave
would
not
give
in
and
though
every
instant
s
delay
but
increased
the
danger
the
discussion
continued
neither
glenarvan
nor
thalcave
appeared
inclined
to
yield
the
indian
had
dragged
his
companion
towards
the
entrance
of
the
ramada
and
showed
him
the
prairie
making
him
understand
that
now
was
the
time
when
it
was
clear
from
the
wolves
but
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
for
should
this
maneuver
not
succeed
it
would
only
render
the
situation
of
those
left
behind
more
desperate
and
that
he
knew
his
horse
well
enough
to
be
able
to
trust
his
wonderful
lightness
and
swiftness
to
save
them
all
but
glenarvan
was
blind
and
obstinate
and
determined
to
sacrifice
himself
at
all
hazards
when
suddenly
he
felt
himself
violently
pushed
back
thaouka
pranced
up
and
reared
himself
bolt
upright
on
his
hind
legs
and
made
a
bound
over
the
barrier
of
fire
while
a
clear
young
voice
called
out
god
save
you
my
but
before
either
thalcave
or
glenarvan
could
get
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
boy
holding
on
fast
by
thaouka
s
mane
he
was
out
of
sight
robert
oh
you
unfortunate
boy
cried
glenarvan
but
even
thalcave
did
not
catch
the
words
for
his
voice
was
drowned
in
the
frightful
uproar
made
by
the
wolves
who
had
dashed
off
at
a
tremendous
speed
on
the
track
of
the
horse
thalcave
and
glenarvan
rushed
out
of
the
ramada
already
the
plain
had
recovered
its
tranquillity
and
all
that
could
be
seen
of
the
red
wolves
was
a
moving
line
far
away
in
the
distant
darkness
glenarvan
sank
prostrate
on
the
ground
and
clasped
his
hands
despairingly
he
looked
at
thalcave
who
smiled
with
his
accustomed
calmness
and
said
thaouka
good
horse
brave
boy
he
will
save
himself
and
suppose
he
falls
said
glenarvan
he
ll
not
but
notwithstanding
thalcave
s
assurances
poor
glenarvan
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
torturing
anxiety
he
seemed
quite
insensible
now
to
the
danger
they
had
escaped
through
the
departure
of
the
wolves
and
would
have
hastened
immediately
after
robert
if
the
indian
had
not
kept
him
back
by
making
him
understand
the
impossibility
of
their
horses
overtaking
thaouka
and
also
that
boy
and
horse
had
outdistanced
the
wolves
long
since
and
that
it
would
be
useless
going
to
look
for
them
till
daylight
at
four
o
clock
morning
began
to
dawn
a
pale
glimmer
appeared
in
the
horizon
and
pearly
drops
of
dew
lay
thick
on
the
plain
and
on
the
tall
grass
already
stirred
by
the
breath
of
day
the
time
for
starting
had
arrived
now
cried
thalcave
glenarvan
made
no
reply
but
took
robert
s
horse
and
sprung
into
the
saddle
next
minute
both
men
were
galloping
at
full
speed
toward
the
west
in
the
line
in
which
their
companions
ought
to
be
advancing
they
dashed
along
at
a
prodigious
rate
for
a
full
hour
dreading
every
minute
to
come
across
the
mangled
corpse
of
robert
glenarvan
had
torn
the
flanks
of
his
horse
with
his
spurs
in
his
mad
haste
when
at
last
were
heard
in
the
distance
at
regular
intervals
as
if
fired
as
a
signal
there
they
are
exclaimed
glenarvan
and
both
he
and
the
indian
urged
on
their
steeds
to
a
still
quicker
pace
till
in
a
few
minutes
more
they
came
up
to
the
little
detachment
conducted
by
paganel
a
cry
broke
from
glenarvan
s
lips
for
robert
was
there
alive
and
well
still
mounted
on
the
superb
thaouka
who
neighed
loudly
with
delight
at
the
sight
of
his
master
oh
my
child
my
child
cried
glenarvan
with
indescribable
tenderness
in
his
tone
both
he
and
robert
leaped
to
the
ground
and
flung
themselves
into
each
other
s
arms
then
the
indian
hugged
the
brave
boy
in
his
arms
he
is
alive
he
is
alive
repeated
glenarvan
again
and
again
yes
replied
robert
and
thanks
to
this
great
recognition
of
his
favorite
s
services
was
wholly
unexpected
by
the
indian
who
was
talking
to
him
that
minute
caressing
and
speaking
to
him
as
if
human
blood
flowed
in
the
veins
of
the
proud
creature
then
turning
to
paganel
he
pointed
to
robert
and
said
a
brave
and
employing
the
indian
metaphor
he
added
his
spurs
did
not
tremble
but
glenarvan
put
his
arms
round
the
boy
and
said
why
wouldn
t
you
let
me
or
thalcave
run
the
risk
of
this
last
chance
of
deliverance
my
son
my
lord
replied
the
boy
in
tones
of
gratitude
wasn
t
it
my
place
to
do
it
thalcave
has
saved
my
life
already
and
you
you
are
going
to
save
my
chapter
xx
strange
signs
after
the
first
joy
of
the
meeting
was
over
paganel
and
his
party
except
perhaps
the
major
were
only
conscious
of
one
feeling
they
were
dying
of
thirst
most
fortunately
for
them
the
guamini
ran
not
far
off
and
about
seven
in
the
morning
the
little
troop
reached
the
inclosure
on
its
banks
the
precincts
were
strewed
with
the
dead
wolves
and
judging
from
their
numbers
it
was
evident
how
violent
the
attack
must
have
been
and
how
desperate
the
resistance
as
soon
as
the
travelers
had
drunk
their
fill
they
began
to
demolish
the
breakfast
prepared
in
the
ramada
and
did
ample
justice
to
the
extraordinary
viands
the
nandou
fillets
were
pronounced
and
the
armadillo
was
delicious
to
eat
moderately
said
paganel
would
be
positive
ingratitude
to
providence
we
must
eat
and
so
they
did
but
were
none
the
worse
for
it
the
water
of
the
guamini
greatly
aided
digestion
apparently
glenarvan
however
was
not
going
to
imitate
hannibal
at
capua
and
at
ten
o
clock
next
morning
gave
the
signal
for
starting
the
leathern
bottles
were
filled
with
water
and
the
day
s
march
commenced
the
horses
were
so
well
rested
that
they
were
quite
fresh
again
and
kept
up
a
canter
almost
constantly
the
country
was
not
so
parched
up
now
and
consequently
less
sterile
but
still
a
desert
no
incident
occurred
of
any
importance
during
the
and
of
november
and
in
the
evening
they
reached
the
boundary
of
the
pampas
and
camped
for
the
night
on
the
frontiers
of
the
province
of
buenos
ayres
of
their
journey
was
now
accomplished
it
was
days
since
they
left
the
bay
of
talcahuano
and
they
had
gone
miles
next
morning
they
crossed
the
conventional
line
which
separates
the
argentine
plains
from
the
region
of
the
pampas
it
was
here
that
thalcave
hoped
to
meet
the
caciques
in
whose
hands
he
had
no
doubt
harry
grant
and
his
men
were
prisoners
from
the
time
of
leaving
the
guamini
there
was
marked
change
in
the
temperature
to
the
great
relief
of
the
travelers
it
was
much
cooler
thanks
to
the
violent
and
cold
winds
from
patagonia
which
constantly
agitate
the
atmospheric
waves
horses
and
men
were
glad
enough
of
this
after
what
they
had
suffered
from
the
heat
and
drought
and
they
felt
animated
with
fresh
ardor
and
confidence
but
contrary
to
what
thalcave
had
said
the
whole
district
appeared
uninhabited
or
rather
abandoned
their
route
often
led
past
or
went
right
through
small
lagoons
sometimes
of
fresh
water
sometimes
of
brackish
on
the
banks
and
bushes
about
these
were
hopping
about
and
larks
singing
joyously
in
concert
with
the
tangaras
the
rivals
in
color
of
the
brilliant
humming
birds
on
the
thorny
bushes
the
nests
of
the
annubis
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
breeze
like
an
indian
hammock
and
on
the
shore
magnificent
flamingos
stalked
in
regular
order
like
soldiers
marching
and
spread
out
their
flaming
red
wings
their
nests
were
seen
in
groups
of
thousands
forming
a
complete
town
about
a
foot
high
and
resembling
a
truncated
cone
in
shape
the
flamingos
did
not
disturb
themselves
in
the
least
at
the
approach
of
the
travelers
but
this
did
not
suit
paganel
i
have
been
very
desirous
a
long
time
he
said
to
the
major
to
see
a
flamingo
all
right
replied
mcnabbs
now
while
i
have
the
opportunity
i
should
like
to
make
the
most
of
it
continued
paganel
very
well
do
it
come
with
me
then
major
and
you
too
robert
i
want
and
all
three
went
off
towards
the
flamingos
leaving
the
others
to
go
on
in
advance
as
soon
as
they
were
near
enough
paganel
fired
only
loading
his
gun
however
with
powder
for
he
would
not
shed
even
the
blood
of
a
bird
uselessly
the
shot
made
the
whole
assemblage
fly
away
while
paganel
watched
them
attentively
through
his
spectacles
well
did
you
see
them
fly
he
asked
the
major
certainly
i
did
was
the
reply
i
could
not
help
seeing
them
unless
i
had
been
well
and
did
you
think
they
resembled
feathered
arrows
when
they
were
flying
not
in
the
not
a
bit
added
robert
i
was
sure
of
it
said
the
geographer
with
a
satisfied
air
and
yet
the
very
proudest
of
modest
men
my
illustrious
countryman
chateaubriand
made
the
inaccurate
comparison
oh
robert
comparison
is
the
most
dangerous
figure
in
rhetoric
that
i
know
mind
you
avoid
it
all
your
life
and
only
employ
it
in
a
last
are
you
satisfied
with
your
experiment
asked
mcnabbs
and
so
am
i
but
we
had
better
push
on
now
for
your
illustrious
chateaubriand
has
put
us
more
than
a
mile
on
rejoining
their
companions
they
found
glenarvan
busily
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
indian
though
apparently
unable
to
make
him
understand
thalcave
s
gaze
was
fixed
intently
on
the
horizon
and
his
face
wore
a
puzzled
expression
the
moment
paganel
came
in
sight
glenarvan
called
out
come
along
friend
paganel
thalcave
and
i
can
t
understand
each
other
at
after
a
few
minute
s
talk
with
the
patagonian
the
interpreter
turned
to
glenarvan
and
said
thalcave
is
quite
astonished
at
the
fact
and
certainly
it
is
very
strange
that
there
are
no
indians
nor
even
traces
of
any
to
be
seen
in
these
plains
for
they
are
generally
thick
with
companies
of
them
either
driving
along
cattle
stolen
from
the
estancias
or
going
to
the
andes
to
sell
their
zorillo
cloths
and
plaited
leather
and
what
does
thalcave
think
is
the
reason
he
does
not
know
he
is
amazed
and
that
s
but
what
description
of
indians
did
he
reckon
on
meeting
in
this
part
of
the
pampas
just
the
very
ones
who
had
the
foreign
prisoners
in
their
hands
the
natives
under
the
rule
of
the
caciques
calfoucoura
catriel
or
who
are
these
caciques
chiefs
that
were
all
powerful
thirty
years
ago
before
they
were
driven
beyond
the
sierras
since
then
they
have
been
reduced
to
subjection
as
much
as
indians
can
be
and
they
scour
the
plains
of
the
pampas
and
the
province
of
buenos
ayres
i
quite
share
thalcave
s
surprise
at
not
discovering
any
traces
of
them
in
regions
which
they
usually
infest
as
salteadores
or
and
what
must
we
do
then
i
ll
go
and
ask
him
replied
paganel
after
a
brief
colloquy
he
returned
and
said
this
is
his
advice
and
very
sensible
it
is
i
think
he
says
we
had
better
continue
our
route
to
the
east
as
far
as
fort
independence
and
if
we
don
t
get
news
of
captain
grant
there
we
shall
hear
at
any
rate
what
has
become
of
the
indians
of
the
argentine
is
fort
independence
far
away
asked
glenarvan
no
it
is
in
the
sierra
tandil
a
distance
of
about
sixty
and
when
shall
we
arrive
the
day
after
in
the
glenarvan
was
considerably
disconcerted
by
this
circumstance
not
to
find
an
indian
where
in
general
there
were
only
too
many
was
so
unusual
that
there
must
be
some
grave
cause
for
it
but
worse
still
if
harry
grant
were
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
any
of
those
tribes
had
he
been
dragged
away
with
them
to
the
north
or
south
glenarvan
felt
that
cost
what
it
might
they
must
not
lose
his
track
and
therefore
decided
to
follow
the
advice
of
thalcave
and
go
to
the
village
of
tandil
they
would
find
some
one
there
to
speak
to
at
all
events
about
four
o
clock
in
the
evening
a
hill
which
seemed
a
mountain
in
so
flat
a
country
was
sighted
in
the
distance
this
was
sierra
tapalquem
at
the
foot
of
which
the
travelers
camped
that
night
the
passage
in
the
morning
over
this
sierra
was
accomplished
without
the
slightest
difficulty
after
having
crossed
the
cordillera
of
the
andes
it
was
easy
work
to
ascend
the
gentle
heights
of
such
a
sierra
as
this
the
horses
scarcely
slackened
their
speed
at
noon
they
passed
the
deserted
fort
of
tapalquem
the
first
of
the
chain
of
forts
which
defend
the
southern
frontiers
from
indian
marauders
but
to
the
increasing
surprise
of
thalcave
they
did
not
come
across
even
the
shadow
of
an
indian
about
the
middle
of
the
day
however
three
flying
horsemen
well
mounted
and
well
armed
came
in
sight
gazed
at
them
for
an
instant
and
then
sped
away
with
inconceivable
rapidity
glenarvan
was
furious
gauchos
said
the
patagonian
designating
them
by
the
name
which
had
caused
such
a
fiery
discussion
between
the
major
and
paganel
ah
the
gauchos
replied
mcnabbs
well
paganel
the
north
wind
is
not
blowing
what
do
you
think
of
those
fellows
yonder
i
think
they
look
like
regular
and
how
far
is
it
from
looking
to
being
my
good
geographer
only
just
a
step
my
dear
paganel
s
admission
was
received
with
a
general
laugh
which
did
not
in
the
least
disconcert
him
he
went
on
talking
about
the
indians
however
and
made
this
curious
observation
i
have
read
somewhere
he
said
that
about
the
arabs
there
is
a
peculiar
expression
of
ferocity
in
the
mouth
while
the
eyes
have
a
kindly
look
now
in
these
american
savages
it
is
quite
the
reverse
for
the
eye
has
a
particularly
villainous
no
physiognomist
by
profession
could
have
better
characterized
the
indian
race
but
desolate
as
the
country
appeared
thalcave
was
on
his
guard
against
surprises
and
gave
orders
to
his
party
to
form
themselves
in
a
close
platoon
it
was
a
useless
precaution
however
for
that
same
evening
they
camped
for
the
night
in
an
immense
tolderia
which
they
not
only
found
perfectly
empty
but
which
the
patagonian
declared
after
he
had
examined
it
all
round
must
have
been
uninhabited
for
a
long
time
next
day
the
first
estancias
of
the
sierra
tandil
came
in
sight
the
estancias
are
large
cattle
stations
for
breeding
cattle
but
thalcave
resolved
not
to
stop
at
any
of
them
but
to
go
straight
on
to
fort
independence
they
passed
several
farms
fortified
by
battlements
and
surrounded
by
a
deep
moat
the
principal
building
being
encircled
by
a
terrace
from
which
the
inhabitants
could
fire
down
on
the
marauders
in
the
plain
glenarvan
might
perhaps
have
got
some
information
at
these
houses
but
it
was
the
surest
plan
to
go
straight
on
to
the
village
of
tandil
accordingly
they
went
on
without
stopping
fording
the
rio
of
los
huasos
and
also
the
chapaleofu
a
few
miles
further
on
soon
they
were
treading
the
grassy
slopes
of
the
first
ridges
of
the
sierra
tandil
and
an
hour
afterward
the
village
appeared
in
the
depths
of
a
narrow
gorge
and
above
it
towered
the
lofty
battlements
of
fort
independence
chapter
xxi
a
false
trail
the
sierra
tandil
rises
a
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
it
is
a
primordial
chain
that
is
to
say
anterior
to
all
organic
and
metamorphic
creation
it
is
formed
of
a
ridge
of
gneiss
hills
covered
with
fine
short
grass
the
district
of
tandil
to
which
it
has
given
its
name
includes
all
the
south
of
the
province
of
buenos
ayres
and
terminates
in
a
river
which
conveys
north
all
the
rios
that
take
their
rise
on
its
slopes
after
making
a
short
ascent
up
the
sierra
they
reached
the
postern
gate
so
carelessly
guarded
by
an
argentine
sentinel
that
they
passed
through
without
difficulty
a
circumstance
which
betokened
extreme
negligence
or
extreme
security
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
commandant
appeared
in
person
he
was
a
vigorous
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
of
military
aspect
with
grayish
hair
and
an
imperious
eye
as
far
as
one
could
see
through
the
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
which
escaped
from
his
short
pipe
his
walk
reminded
paganel
instantly
of
the
old
subalterns
in
his
own
country
thalcave
was
spokesman
and
addressing
the
officer
presented
lord
glenarvan
and
his
companions
while
he
was
speaking
the
commandant
kept
staring
fixedly
at
paganel
in
rather
an
embarrassing
manner
the
geographer
could
not
understand
what
he
meant
by
it
and
was
just
about
to
interrogate
him
when
the
commandant
came
forward
and
seizing
both
his
hands
in
the
most
fashion
said
in
a
joyous
voice
in
the
mother
tongue
of
the
geographer
a
frenchman
yes
a
frenchman
replied
paganel
ah
delightful
welcome
welcome
i
am
a
frenchman
too
he
added
shaking
paganel
s
hand
with
such
vigor
as
to
be
almost
alarming
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
paganel
asked
the
major
yes
said
paganel
somewhat
proudly
one
has
friends
in
every
division
of
the
after
he
had
succeeded
in
disengaging
his
hand
though
not
without
difficulty
from
the
living
vise
in
which
it
was
held
a
lively
conversation
ensued
glenarvan
would
fain
have
put
in
a
word
about
the
business
on
hand
but
the
commandant
related
his
entire
history
and
was
not
in
a
mood
to
stop
till
he
had
done
it
was
evident
that
the
worthy
man
must
have
left
his
native
country
many
years
back
for
his
mother
tongue
had
grown
unfamiliar
and
if
he
had
not
forgotten
the
words
he
certainly
did
not
remember
how
to
put
them
together
he
spoke
more
like
a
negro
belonging
to
a
french
colony
the
fact
was
that
the
governor
of
fort
independence
was
a
french
sergeant
an
old
comrade
of
parachapee
he
had
never
left
the
fort
since
it
had
been
built
in
and
strange
to
say
he
commanded
it
with
the
consent
of
the
argentine
government
he
was
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
a
basque
by
birth
and
his
name
was
manuel
ipharaguerre
so
that
he
was
almost
a
spaniard
a
year
after
his
arrival
in
the
country
he
was
naturalized
took
service
in
the
argentine
army
and
married
an
indian
girl
who
was
then
nursing
twin
babies
six
months
old
two
boys
be
it
understood
for
the
good
wife
of
the
commandant
would
have
never
thought
of
presenting
her
husband
with
girls
manuel
could
not
conceive
of
any
state
but
a
military
one
and
he
hoped
in
due
time
with
the
help
of
god
to
offer
the
republic
a
whole
company
of
young
soldiers
you
saw
them
charming
good
soldiers
are
jose
juan
and
miquele
pepe
seven
year
old
pepe
can
handle
a
pepe
hearing
himself
complimented
brought
his
two
little
feet
together
and
presented
arms
with
perfect
grace
he
ll
get
on
added
the
sergeant
he
ll
be
or
some
sergeant
manuel
seemed
so
enchanted
that
it
would
have
been
useless
to
express
a
contrary
opinion
either
to
the
profession
of
arms
or
the
probable
future
of
his
children
he
was
happy
and
as
goethe
says
nothing
that
makes
us
happy
is
an
all
this
talk
took
up
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
the
great
astonishment
of
thalcave
the
indian
could
not
understand
how
so
many
words
could
come
out
of
one
throat
no
one
interrupted
the
sergeant
but
all
things
come
to
an
end
and
at
last
he
was
silent
but
not
till
he
had
made
his
guests
enter
his
dwelling
and
be
presented
to
madame
ipharaguerre
then
and
not
till
then
did
he
ask
his
guests
what
had
procured
him
the
honor
of
their
visit
now
or
never
was
the
moment
to
explain
and
paganel
seizing
the
chance
at
once
began
an
account
of
their
journey
across
the
pampas
and
ended
by
inquiring
the
reason
of
the
indians
having
deserted
the
country
ah
there
was
no
one
replied
the
sergeant
shrugging
his
shoulders
really
no
one
and
us
too
our
arms
crossed
nothing
to
do
but
why
war
yes
civil
war
between
the
paraguayans
and
buenos
ayriens
replied
the
sergeant
well
well
indians
all
in
the
north
in
the
rear
of
general
flores
indian
pillagers
find
pillage
but
where
are
the
caciques
caciques
are
with
what
catriel
there
is
no
and
calfoucoura
there
is
no
and
is
there
no
yanchetruz
no
no
the
reply
was
interpreted
by
thalcave
who
shook
his
head
and
gave
an
approving
look
the
patagonian
was
either
unaware
of
or
had
forgotten
that
civil
war
was
decimating
the
two
parts
of
the
republic
a
war
which
ultimately
required
the
intervention
of
brazil
the
indians
have
everything
to
gain
by
these
intestine
strifes
and
can
not
lose
such
fine
opportunities
of
plunder
there
was
no
doubt
the
sergeant
was
right
in
assigning
war
then
as
the
cause
of
the
forsaken
appearance
of
the
plains
but
this
circumstance
upset
all
glenarvan
s
projects
for
if
harry
grant
was
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
caciques
he
must
have
been
dragged
north
with
them
how
and
where
should
they
ever
find
him
if
that
were
the
case
should
they
attempt
a
perilous
and
almost
useless
journey
to
the
northern
border
of
the
pampas
it
was
a
serious
question
which
would
need
to
be
well
talked
over
however
there
was
one
inquiry
more
to
make
to
the
sergeant
and
it
was
the
major
who
thought
of
it
for
all
the
others
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
had
the
sergeant
heard
whether
any
europeans
were
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
caciques
manuel
looked
thoughtful
for
a
few
minutes
like
a
man
trying
to
ransack
his
memory
at
last
he
said
ah
said
glenarvan
catching
at
the
fresh
hope
they
all
eagerly
crowded
round
the
sergeant
exclaiming
tell
us
tell
it
was
some
years
ago
replied
manuel
yes
all
i
heard
was
that
some
europeans
were
prisoners
but
i
never
saw
you
are
making
a
mistake
said
glenarvan
it
can
t
be
some
years
ago
the
date
of
the
shipwreck
is
explicitly
given
the
britannia
was
wrecked
in
june
it
is
scarcely
two
years
oh
more
than
that
my
impossible
said
paganel
oh
but
it
must
be
it
was
when
pepe
was
born
there
were
two
no
three
said
glenarvan
two
replied
the
sergeant
in
a
positive
tone
two
echoed
glenarvan
much
surprised
two
englishmen
no
no
who
is
talking
of
englishmen
no
a
frenchman
and
an
an
italian
who
was
massacred
by
the
poyuches
exclaimed
paganel
yes
and
i
heard
afterward
that
the
frenchman
was
saved
exclaimed
young
robert
his
very
life
hanging
on
the
lips
of
the
sergeant
yes
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
the
paganel
struck
his
forehead
with
an
air
of
desperation
and
said
at
last
ah
i
understand
it
is
all
clear
now
everything
is
but
what
is
it
asked
glenarvan
with
as
much
impatience
my
friends
replied
paganel
taking
both
robert
s
hands
in
his
own
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
a
sad
disaster
we
have
been
on
a
wrong
track
the
prisoner
mentioned
is
not
the
captain
at
all
but
one
of
my
own
countrymen
and
his
companion
who
was
assassinated
by
the
poyuches
was
marco
vazello
the
frenchman
was
dragged
along
by
the
cruel
indians
several
times
as
far
as
the
shores
of
the
colorado
but
managed
at
length
to
make
his
escape
and
return
to
colorado
instead
of
following
the
track
of
harry
grant
we
have
fallen
on
that
of
young
this
announcement
was
heard
with
profound
silence
the
mistake
was
palpable
the
details
given
by
the
sergeant
the
nationality
of
the
prisoner
the
murder
of
his
companions
his
escape
from
the
hands
of
the
indians
all
evidenced
the
fact
glenarvan
looked
at
thalcave
with
a
crestfallen
face
and
the
indian
turning
to
the
sergeant
asked
whether
he
had
never
heard
of
three
english
captives
never
replied
manuel
they
would
have
known
of
them
at
tandil
i
am
sure
no
it
can
not
after
this
there
was
nothing
further
to
do
at
fort
independence
but
to
shake
hands
with
the
commandant
and
thank
him
and
take
leave
glenarvan
was
in
despair
at
this
complete
overthrow
of
his
hopes
and
robert
walked
silently
beside
him
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
glenarvan
could
not
find
a
word
of
comfort
to
say
to
him
paganel
gesticulated
and
talked
away
to
himself
the
major
never
opened
his
mouth
nor
thalcave
whose
as
an
indian
seemed
quite
wounded
by
having
allowed
himself
to
go
on
a
wrong
scent
no
one
however
would
have
thought
of
reproaching
him
for
an
error
so
pardonable
they
went
back
to
the
fonda
and
had
supper
but
it
was
a
gloomy
party
that
surrounded
the
table
it
was
not
that
any
one
of
them
regretted
the
fatigue
they
had
so
heedlessly
endured
or
the
dangers
they
had
run
but
they
felt
their
hope
of
success
was
gone
for
there
was
no
chance
of
coming
across
captain
grant
between
the
sierra
tandil
and
the
sea
as
sergeant
manuel
must
have
heard
if
any
prisoners
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
indians
on
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
any
event
of
this
nature
would
have
attracted
the
notice
of
the
indian
traders
who
traffic
between
tandil
and
carmen
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
the
best
thing
to
do
now
was
to
get
to
the
duncan
as
quick
as
possible
at
the
appointed
rendezvous
paganel
asked
glenarvan
however
to
let
him
have
the
document
again
on
the
faith
of
which
they
had
set
out
on
so
bootless
a
search
he
read
it
over
and
over
as
if
trying
to
extract
some
new
meaning
out
of
it
yet
nothing
can
be
clearer
said
glenarvan
it
gives
the
date
of
the
shipwreck
and
the
manner
and
the
place
of
the
captivity
in
the
most
categorical
that
it
does
not
no
it
does
not
exclaimed
paganel
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
since
harry
grant
is
not
in
the
pampas
he
is
not
in
america
but
where
he
is
the
document
must
say
and
it
shall
say
my
friends
or
my
name
is
not
jacques
paganel
any
chapter
xxii
the
flood
a
distance
of
miles
separates
fort
independence
from
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
unless
unexpected
and
certainly
improbable
delays
should
occur
in
four
days
glenarvan
would
rejoin
the
duncan
but
to
return
on
board
without
captain
grant
and
after
having
so
completely
failed
in
his
search
was
what
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
consequently
when
next
day
came
he
gave
no
orders
for
departure
the
major
took
it
upon
himself
to
have
the
horses
saddled
and
make
all
preparations
thanks
to
his
activity
next
morning
at
eight
o
clock
the
little
troop
was
descending
the
grassy
slopes
of
the
sierra
glenarvan
with
robert
at
his
side
galloped
along
without
saying
a
word
his
bold
determined
nature
made
it
impossible
to
take
failure
quietly
his
heart
throbbed
as
if
it
would
burst
and
his
head
was
burning
paganel
excited
by
the
difficulty
was
turning
over
and
over
the
words
of
the
document
and
trying
to
discover
some
new
meaning
thalcave
was
perfectly
silent
and
left
thaouka
to
lead
the
way
the
major
always
confident
remained
firm
at
his
post
like
a
man
on
whom
discouragement
takes
no
hold
tom
austin
and
his
two
sailors
shared
the
dejection
of
their
master
a
timid
rabbit
happened
to
run
across
their
path
and
the
superstitious
men
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
a
bad
omen
said
wilson
yes
in
the
highlands
repeated
mulrady
what
s
bad
in
the
highlands
is
not
better
here
returned
wilson
sententiously
toward
noon
they
had
crossed
the
sierra
and
descended
into
the
undulating
plains
which
extend
to
the
sea
limpid
rios
intersected
these
plains
and
lost
themselves
among
the
tall
grasses
the
ground
had
once
more
become
a
dead
level
the
last
mountains
of
the
pampas
were
passed
and
a
long
carpet
of
verdure
unrolled
itself
over
the
monotonous
prairie
beneath
the
horses
tread
hitherto
the
weather
had
been
fine
but
the
sky
presented
anything
but
a
reassuring
appearance
the
heavy
vapors
generated
by
the
high
temperature
of
the
preceding
days
hung
in
thick
clouds
which
ere
long
would
empty
themselves
in
torrents
of
rain
moreover
the
vicinity
of
the
atlantic
and
the
prevailing
west
wind
made
the
climate
of
this
district
particularly
damp
this
was
evident
by
the
fertility
and
abundance
of
the
pasture
and
its
dark
color
however
the
clouds
remained
unbroken
for
the
present
and
in
the
evening
after
a
brisk
gallop
of
forty
miles
the
horses
stopped
on
the
brink
of
deep
canadas
immense
natural
trenches
filled
with
water
no
shelter
was
near
and
ponchos
had
to
serve
both
for
tents
and
coverlets
as
each
man
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
beneath
the
threatening
sky
next
day
the
presence
of
water
became
still
more
sensibly
felt
it
seemed
to
exude
from
every
pore
of
the
ground
soon
large
ponds
some
just
beginning
to
form
and
some
already
deep
lay
across
the
route
to
the
east
as
long
as
they
had
only
to
deal
with
lagoons
circumscribed
pieces
of
water
unencumbered
with
aquatic
plants
the
horses
could
get
through
well
enough
but
when
they
encountered
moving
sloughs
called
pentanos
it
was
harder
work
tall
grass
blocked
them
up
and
they
were
involved
in
the
peril
before
they
were
aware
these
bogs
had
already
proved
fatal
to
more
than
one
living
thing
for
robert
who
had
got
a
good
bit
ahead
of
the
party
came
rushing
back
at
full
gallop
calling
out
monsieur
paganel
monsieur
paganel
a
forest
of
what
exclaimed
the
geographer
you
have
found
a
forest
of
horns
yes
yes
or
at
any
rate
a
a
coppice
replied
paganel
shrugging
his
shoulders
my
boy
you
are
i
am
not
dreaming
and
you
will
see
for
yourself
well
this
is
a
strange
country
they
sow
horns
and
they
sprout
up
like
wheat
i
wish
i
could
get
some
of
the
the
boy
is
really
speaking
seriously
said
the
major
yes
major
and
you
will
soon
see
i
am
the
boy
had
not
been
mistaken
for
presently
they
found
themselves
in
front
of
an
immense
field
of
horns
regularly
planted
and
stretching
far
out
of
sight
it
was
a
complete
copse
low
and
close
packed
but
a
strange
sort
well
said
robert
this
is
peculiar
certainly
said
paganel
and
he
turned
round
to
question
thalcave
on
the
subject
the
horns
come
out
of
the
ground
replied
the
indian
but
the
oxen
are
down
what
exclaimed
paganel
do
you
mean
to
say
that
a
whole
herd
was
caught
in
that
mud
and
buried
alive
yes
said
the
patagonian
and
so
it
was
an
immense
herd
had
been
suffocated
side
by
side
in
this
enormous
bog
and
this
was
not
the
first
occurrence
of
the
kind
which
had
taken
place
in
the
argentine
plains
an
hour
afterward
and
the
field
of
horns
lay
two
miles
behind
thalcave
was
somewhat
anxiously
observing
a
state
of
things
which
appeared
to
him
unusual
he
frequently
stopped
and
raised
himself
on
his
stirrups
and
looked
around
his
great
height
gave
him
a
commanding
view
of
the
whole
horizon
but
after
a
keen
rapid
survey
he
quickly
resumed
his
seat
and
went
on
about
a
mile
further
he
stopped
again
and
leaving
the
straight
route
made
a
circuit
of
some
miles
north
and
south
and
then
returned
and
fell
back
in
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
troop
without
saying
a
syllable
as
to
what
he
hoped
or
feared
this
strange
behavior
several
times
repeated
made
glenarvan
very
uneasy
and
quite
puzzled
paganel
at
last
at
glenarvan
s
request
he
asked
the
indian
about
it
thalcave
replied
that
he
was
astonished
to
see
the
plains
so
saturated
with
water
never
to
his
knowledge
since
he
had
followed
the
calling
of
guide
had
he
found
the
ground
in
this
soaking
condition
even
in
the
rainy
season
the
argentine
plains
had
always
been
passable
but
what
is
the
cause
of
this
increasing
humidity
said
paganel
i
do
not
know
and
what
if
i
did
could
it
be
owing
to
the
rios
of
the
sierra
being
swollen
to
overflowing
by
the
heavy
rains
sometimes
they
and
is
it
the
case
now
paganel
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
this
unsatisfactory
reply
and
went
back
to
glenarvan
to
report
the
result
of
his
conversation
and
what
does
thalcave
advise
us
to
do
said
glenarvan
paganel
went
back
to
the
guide
and
asked
him
go
on
fast
was
the
reply
this
was
easier
said
than
done
the
horses
soon
tired
of
treading
over
ground
that
gave
way
at
every
step
it
sank
each
moment
more
and
more
till
it
seemed
half
under
water
they
quickened
their
pace
but
could
not
go
fast
enough
to
escape
the
water
which
rolled
in
great
sheets
at
their
feet
before
two
hours
the
cataracts
of
the
sky
opened
and
deluged
the
plain
in
true
tropical
torrents
of
rain
never
was
there
a
finer
occasion
for
displaying
philosophic
equanimity
there
was
no
shelter
and
nothing
for
it
but
to
bear
it
stolidly
the
ponchos
were
streaming
like
the
overflowing
on
the
roof
of
a
house
and
the
unfortunate
horsemen
had
to
submit
to
a
double
bath
for
their
horses
dashed
up
the
water
to
their
waists
at
every
step
in
this
drenching
shivering
state
and
worn
out
with
fatigue
they
came
toward
evening
to
a
miserable
rancho
which
could
only
have
been
called
a
shelter
by
people
not
very
fastidious
and
certainly
only
travelers
in
extremity
would
even
have
entered
it
but
glenarvan
and
his
companions
had
no
choice
and
were
glad
enough
to
burrow
in
this
wretched
hovel
though
it
would
have
been
despised
by
even
a
poor
indian
of
the
pampas
a
miserable
fire
of
grass
was
kindled
which
gave
out
more
smoke
than
heat
and
was
very
difficult
to
keep
alight
as
the
torrents
of
rain
which
dashed
against
the
ruined
cabin
outside
found
their
way
within
and
fell
down
in
large
drops
from
the
roof
twenty
times
over
the
fire
would
have
been
extinguished
if
mulrady
and
wilson
had
not
kept
off
the
water
the
supper
was
a
dull
meal
and
neither
appetizing
nor
reviving
only
the
major
seemed
to
eat
with
any
relish
the
impassive
mcnabbs
was
superior
to
all
circumstances
paganel
frenchman
as
he
was
tried
to
joke
but
the
attempt
was
a
failure
my
jests
are
damp
he
said
they
miss
the
only
consolation
in
such
circumstances
was
to
sleep
and
accordingly
each
one
lay
down
and
endeavored
to
find
in
slumber
a
temporary
forgetfulness
of
his
discomforts
and
his
fatigues
the
night
was
stormy
and
the
planks
of
the
rancho
cracked
before
the
blast
as
if
every
instant
they
would
give
way
the
poor
horses
outside
exposed
to
all
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
were
making
piteous
moans
and
their
masters
were
suffering
quite
as
much
inside
the
ruined
rancho
however
sleep
overpowered
them
at
length
robert
was
the
first
to
close
his
eyes
and
lean
his
head
against
glenarvan
s
shoulder
and
soon
all
the
rest
were
soundly
sleeping
too
under
the
guardian
eye
of
heaven
the
night
passed
safely
and
no
one
stirred
till
thaouka
woke
them
by
tapping
vigorously
against
the
rancho
with
his
hoof
he
knew
it
was
time
to
start
and
at
a
push
could
give
the
signal
as
well
as
his
master
they
owed
the
faithful
creature
too
much
to
disobey
him
and
set
off
immediately
the
rain
had
abated
but
floods
of
water
still
covered
the
ground
paganel
on
consulting
his
map
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
rios
grande
and
vivarota
into
which
the
water
from
the
plains
generally
runs
must
have
been
united
in
one
large
bed
several
miles
in
extent
extreme
haste
was
imperative
for
all
their
lives
depended
on
it
should
the
inundation
increase
where
could
they
find
refuge
not
a
single
elevated
point
was
visible
on
the
whole
circle
of
the
horizon
and
on
such
level
plains
water
would
sweep
along
with
fearful
rapidity
the
horses
were
spurred
on
to
the
utmost
and
thaouka
led
the
way
bounding
over
the
water
as
if
it
had
been
his
natural
element
certainly
he
might
justly
have
been
called
a
better
than
many
of
the
amphibious
animals
who
bear
that
name
all
of
a
sudden
about
ten
in
the
morning
thaouka
betrayed
symptoms
of
violent
agitation
he
kept
turning
round
toward
the
south
neighing
continually
and
snorting
with
wide
open
nostrils
he
reared
violently
and
thalcave
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
his
seat
the
foam
from
his
mouth
was
tinged
with
blood
from
the
action
of
the
bit
pulled
tightly
by
his
master
s
strong
hand
and
yet
the
fiery
animal
would
not
be
still
had
he
been
free
his
master
knew
he
would
have
fled
away
to
the
north
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
have
carried
him
what
is
the
matter
with
thaouka
asked
paganel
is
he
bitten
by
the
leeches
they
are
very
voracious
in
the
argentine
no
replied
the
indian
is
he
frightened
at
something
then
yes
he
scents
what
danger
i
don
t
but
though
no
danger
was
apparent
to
the
eye
the
ear
could
catch
the
sound
of
a
murmuring
noise
beyond
the
limits
of
the
horizon
like
the
coming
in
of
the
tide
soon
a
confused
sound
was
heard
of
bellowing
and
neighing
and
bleating
and
about
a
mile
to
the
south
immense
flocks
appeared
rushing
and
tumbling
over
each
other
in
the
greatest
disorder
as
they
hurried
along
with
inconceivable
rapidity
they
raised
such
a
whirlwind
of
water
in
their
course
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
them
clearly
a
hundred
whales
of
the
largest
size
could
hardly
have
dashed
up
the
ocean
waves
more
violently
anda
quick
quick
shouted
thalcave
in
a
voice
like
thunder
what
is
it
then
asked
paganel
the
rising
replied
thalcave
he
means
an
inundation
exclaimed
paganel
flying
with
the
others
after
thalcave
who
had
spurred
on
his
horse
toward
the
north
it
was
high
time
for
about
five
miles
south
an
immense
towering
wave
was
seen
advancing
over
the
plain
and
changing
the
whole
country
into
an
ocean
the
tall
grass
disappeared
before
it
as
if
cut
down
by
a
scythe
and
clumps
of
mimosas
were
torn
up
and
drifted
about
like
floating
islands
the
wave
was
speeding
on
with
the
rapidity
of
a
racehorse
and
the
travelers
fled
before
it
like
a
cloud
before
a
they
looked
in
vain
for
some
harbor
of
refuge
and
the
terrified
horses
galloped
so
wildly
along
that
the
riders
could
hardly
keep
their
saddles
anda
shouted
thalcave
and
again
they
spurred
on
the
poor
animals
till
the
blood
ran
from
their
lacerated
sides
they
stumbled
every
now
and
then
over
great
cracks
in
the
ground
or
got
entangled
in
the
hidden
grass
below
the
water
they
fell
and
were
pulled
up
only
to
fall
again
and
again
and
be
pulled
up
again
and
again
the
level
of
the
waters
was
sensibly
rising
and
less
than
two
miles
off
the
gigantic
wave
reared
its
crested
head
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
this
supreme
struggle
with
the
most
terrible
of
elements
lasted
the
fugitives
could
not
tell
how
far
they
had
gone
but
judging
by
the
speed
the
distance
must
have
been
considerable
the
poor
horses
however
were
in
water
now
and
could
only
advance
with
extreme
difficulty
glenarvan
and
paganel
and
indeed
the
whole
party
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
as
the
horses
were
fast
getting
out
of
their
depth
and
six
feet
of
water
would
be
enough
to
drown
them
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
the
anguish
of
mind
these
eight
men
endured
they
felt
their
own
impotence
in
the
presence
of
these
cataclysms
of
nature
so
far
beyond
all
human
power
their
salvation
did
not
lie
in
their
own
hands
five
minutes
afterward
and
the
horses
were
swimming
the
current
alone
carried
them
along
with
tremendous
force
and
with
a
swiftness
equal
to
their
fastest
gallop
they
must
have
gone
fully
twenty
miles
an
hour
all
hope
of
delivery
seemed
impossible
when
the
major
suddenly
called
out
a
tree
a
tree
exclaimed
glenarvan
yes
there
there
replied
thalcave
pointing
with
his
finger
to
a
species
of
gigantic
which
raised
its
solitary
head
above
the
waters
his
companions
needed
no
urging
forward
now
this
tree
so
opportunely
discovered
they
must
reach
at
all
hazards
the
horses
very
likely
might
not
be
able
to
get
to
it
but
at
all
events
the
men
would
the
current
bearing
them
right
down
to
it
just
at
that
moment
tom
austin
s
horse
gave
a
smothered
neigh
and
disappeared
his
master
freeing
his
feet
from
the
stirrups
began
to
swim
vigorously
hang
on
to
my
saddle
called
glenarvan
thanks
your
honor
but
i
have
good
stout
robert
how
is
your
horse
going
asked
his
lordship
turning
to
young
grant
famously
my
lord
he
swims
like
a
lookout
shouted
the
major
in
a
stentorian
voice
the
warning
was
scarcely
spoken
before
the
enormous
billow
a
monstrous
wave
forty
feet
high
broke
over
the
fugitives
with
a
fearful
noise
men
and
animals
all
disappeared
in
a
whirl
of
foam
a
liquid
mass
weighing
several
millions
of
tons
engulfed
them
in
its
seething
waters
when
it
had
rolled
on
the
men
reappeared
on
the
surface
and
counted
each
other
rapidly
but
all
the
horses
except
thaouka
who
still
bore
his
master
had
gone
down
forever
courage
courage
repeated
glenarvan
supporting
paganel
with
one
arm
and
swimming
with
the
other
i
can
manage
i
can
manage
said
the
worthy
savant
i
am
even
not
sorry
but
no
one
ever
knew
what
he
was
not
sorry
about
for
the
poor
man
was
obliged
to
swallow
down
the
rest
of
his
sentence
with
half
a
pint
of
muddy
water
the
major
advanced
quietly
making
regular
strokes
worthy
of
a
master
swimmer
the
sailors
took
to
the
water
like
porpoises
while
robert
clung
to
thaouka
s
mane
and
was
carried
along
with
him
the
noble
animal
swam
superbly
instinctively
making
for
the
tree
in
a
straight
line
the
tree
was
only
twenty
fathoms
off
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
safely
reached
by
the
whole
party
but
for
this
refuge
they
must
all
have
perished
in
the
flood
the
water
had
risen
to
the
top
of
the
trunk
just
to
where
the
parent
branches
fork
out
it
was
consequently
quite
easy
to
clamber
up
to
it
thalcave
climbed
up
first
and
got
off
his
horse
to
hoist
up
robert
and
help
the
others
his
powerful
arms
had
soon
placed
all
the
exhausted
swimmers
in
a
place
of
security
but
meantime
thaouka
was
being
rapidly
carried
away
by
the
current
he
turned
his
intelligent
face
toward
his
master
and
shaking
his
long
mane
neighed
as
if
to
summon
him
to
his
rescue
are
you
going
to
forsake
him
thalcave
asked
paganel
i
replied
the
indian
and
forthwith
he
plunged
down
into
the
tumultuous
waters
and
came
up
again
ten
fathoms
off
a
few
instants
afterward
his
arms
were
round
thaouka
s
neck
and
master
and
steed
were
drifting
together
toward
the
misty
horizon
of
the
north
chapter
xxiii
a
singular
abode
the
tree
on
which
glenarvan
and
his
companions
had
just
found
refuge
resembled
a
having
the
same
glossy
foliage
and
rounded
form
in
reality
however
it
was
the
ombu
which
grows
solitarily
on
the
argentine
plains
the
enormous
and
twisted
trunk
of
this
tree
is
planted
firmly
in
the
soil
not
only
by
its
great
roots
but
still
more
by
its
vigorous
shoots
which
fasten
it
down
in
the
most
tenacious
manner
this
was
how
it
stood
proof
against
the
shock
of
the
mighty
billow
this
ombu
measured
in
height
a
hundred
feet
and
covered
with
its
shadow
a
circumference
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
yards
all
this
scaffolding
rested
on
three
great
boughs
which
sprang
from
the
trunk
two
of
these
rose
almost
perpendicularly
and
supported
the
immense
parasol
of
foliage
the
branches
of
which
were
so
crossed
and
intertwined
and
entangled
as
if
by
the
hand
of
a
that
they
formed
an
impenetrable
shade
the
third
arm
on
the
contrary
stretched
right
out
in
a
horizontal
position
above
the
roaring
waters
into
which
the
lower
leaves
dipped
there
was
no
want
of
room
in
the
interior
of
this
gigantic
tree
for
there
were
great
gaps
in
the
foliage
perfect
glades
with
air
in
abundance
and
freshness
everywhere
to
see
the
innumerable
branches
rising
to
the
clouds
and
the
creepers
running
from
bough
to
bough
and
attaching
them
together
while
the
sunlight
glinted
here
and
there
among
the
leaves
one
might
have
called
it
a
complete
forest
instead
of
a
solitary
tree
sheltering
them
all
on
the
arrival
of
the
fugitives
a
myriad
of
the
feathered
tribes
fled
away
into
the
topmost
branches
protesting
by
their
outcries
against
this
flagrant
usurpation
of
their
domicile
these
birds
who
themselves
had
taken
refuge
in
the
solitary
ombu
were
in
hundreds
comprising
blackbirds
starlings
isacas
hilgueros
and
especially
the
of
most
resplendent
colors
when
they
flew
away
it
seemed
as
though
a
gust
of
wind
had
blown
all
the
flowers
off
the
tree
such
was
the
asylum
offered
to
the
little
band
of
glenarvan
young
grant
and
the
agile
wilson
were
scarcely
perched
on
the
tree
before
they
had
climbed
to
the
upper
branches
and
put
their
heads
through
the
leafy
dome
to
get
a
view
of
the
vast
horizon
the
ocean
made
by
the
inundation
surrounded
them
on
all
sides
and
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
seemed
to
have
no
limits
not
a
single
tree
was
visible
on
the
liquid
plain
the
ombu
stood
alone
amid
the
rolling
waters
and
trembled
before
them
in
the
distance
drifting
from
south
to
north
carried
along
by
the
impetuous
torrent
they
saw
trees
torn
up
by
the
roots
twisted
branches
roofs
torn
off
destroyed
ranchos
planks
of
sheds
stolen
by
the
deluge
from
estancias
carcasses
of
drowned
animals
skins
and
on
a
shaky
tree
a
complete
family
of
jaguars
howling
and
clutching
hold
of
their
frail
raft
still
farther
away
a
black
spot
almost
invisible
already
caught
wilson
s
eye
it
was
thalcave
and
his
faithful
thaouka
thalcave
thalcave
shouted
robert
stretching
out
his
hands
toward
the
courageous
patagonian
he
will
save
himself
robert
replied
wilson
we
must
go
down
to
his
next
minute
they
had
descended
the
three
stages
of
boughs
and
landed
safely
on
the
top
of
the
trunk
where
they
found
glenarvan
paganel
the
major
austin
and
mulrady
sitting
either
astride
or
in
some
position
they
found
more
comfortable
wilson
gave
an
account
of
their
investigations
aloft
and
all
shared
his
opinion
with
respect
to
thalcave
the
only
question
was
whether
it
was
thalcave
who
would
save
thaouka
or
thaouka
save
thalcave
their
own
situation
meantime
was
much
more
alarming
than
his
no
doubt
the
tree
would
be
able
to
resist
the
current
but
the
waters
might
rise
higher
and
higher
till
the
topmost
branches
were
covered
for
the
depression
of
the
soil
made
this
part
of
the
plain
a
deep
reservoir
glenarvan
s
first
care
consequently
was
to
make
notches
by
which
to
ascertain
the
progress
of
the
inundation
for
the
present
it
was
stationary
having
apparently
reached
its
height
this
was
reassuring
and
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
said
glenarvan
make
our
nest
of
course
replied
paganel
make
our
nest
exclaimed
robert
certainly
my
boy
and
live
the
life
of
birds
since
we
can
t
that
of
all
very
well
but
who
will
fill
our
bills
for
us
said
glenarvan
i
will
said
the
major
all
eyes
turned
toward
him
immediately
and
there
he
sat
in
a
natural
formed
of
two
elastic
boughs
holding
out
his
alforjas
damp
but
still
intact
oh
mcnabbs
that
s
just
like
you
exclaimed
glenarvan
you
think
of
everything
even
under
circumstances
which
would
drive
all
out
of
your
since
it
was
settled
we
were
not
going
to
be
drowned
i
had
no
intention
of
starving
of
i
should
have
thought
of
it
too
said
paganel
but
i
am
so
and
what
is
in
the
alforjas
asked
tom
austin
food
enough
to
last
seven
men
for
two
days
replied
mcnabbs
and
i
hope
the
inundation
will
have
gone
down
in
hours
said
glenarvan
or
that
we
shall
have
found
some
way
of
regaining
added
paganel
our
first
business
then
now
is
to
breakfast
said
glenarvan
i
suppose
you
mean
after
we
have
made
ourselves
dry
observed
the
major
and
where
s
the
fire
asked
wilson
we
must
make
it
returned
paganel
where
on
the
top
of
the
trunk
of
and
what
with
with
the
dead
wood
we
cut
off
the
but
how
will
you
kindle
it
asked
glenarvan
our
tinder
is
just
like
wet
we
can
dispense
with
it
replied
paganel
we
only
want
a
little
dry
moss
and
a
ray
of
sunshine
and
the
lens
of
my
telescope
and
you
ll
see
what
a
fire
i
ll
get
to
dry
myself
by
who
will
go
and
cut
wood
in
the
forest
i
will
said
robert
and
off
he
scampered
like
a
young
cat
into
the
depths
of
the
foliage
followed
by
his
friend
wilson
paganel
set
to
work
to
find
dry
moss
and
had
soon
gathered
sufficient
this
he
laid
on
a
bed
of
damp
leaves
just
where
the
large
branches
began
to
fork
out
forming
a
natural
hearth
where
there
was
little
fear
of
conflagration
robert
and
wilson
speedily
reappeared
each
with
an
armful
of
dry
wood
which
they
threw
on
the
moss
by
the
help
of
the
lens
it
was
easily
kindled
for
the
sun
was
blazing
overhead
in
order
to
ensure
a
proper
draught
paganel
stood
over
the
hearth
with
his
long
legs
straddled
out
in
the
arab
manner
then
stooping
down
and
raising
himself
with
a
rapid
motion
he
made
a
violent
current
of
air
with
his
poncho
which
made
the
wood
take
fire
and
soon
a
bright
flame
roared
in
the
improvised
brasier
after
drying
themselves
each
in
his
own
fashion
and
hanging
their
ponchos
on
the
tree
where
they
were
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
breeze
they
breakfasted
carefully
however
rationing
out
the
provisions
for
the
morrow
had
to
be
thought
of
the
immense
basin
might
not
empty
so
soon
as
glenarvan
expected
and
anyway
the
supply
was
very
limited
the
ombu
produced
no
fruit
though
fortunately
it
would
likely
abound
in
fresh
eggs
thanks
to
the
numerous
nests
stowed
away
among
the
leaves
not
to
speak
of
their
feathered
proprietors
these
resources
were
by
no
means
to
be
despised
the
next
business
was
to
install
themselves
as
comfortably
as
they
could
in
prospect
of
a
long
stay
as
the
kitchen
and
are
on
the
ground
floor
said
paganel
we
must
sleep
on
the
first
floor
the
house
is
large
and
as
the
rent
is
not
dear
we
must
not
cramp
ourselves
for
room
i
can
see
up
yonder
natural
cradles
in
which
once
safely
tucked
up
we
shall
sleep
as
if
we
were
in
the
best
beds
in
the
world
we
have
nothing
to
fear
besides
we
will
watch
and
we
are
numerous
enough
to
repulse
a
fleet
of
indians
and
other
wild
we
only
want
i
have
my
revolvers
said
glenarvan
and
i
have
mine
replied
robert
but
what
s
the
good
of
them
said
tom
austin
unless
monsieur
paganel
can
find
out
some
way
of
making
we
don
t
need
it
replied
mcnabbs
exhibiting
a
powder
flask
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
where
did
you
get
it
from
major
asked
paganel
from
thalcave
he
thought
it
might
be
useful
to
us
and
gave
it
to
me
before
he
plunged
into
the
water
to
save
generous
brave
indian
exclaimed
glenarvan
yes
replied
tom
austin
if
all
the
patagonians
are
cut
after
the
same
pattern
i
must
compliment
i
protest
against
leaving
out
the
horse
said
paganel
he
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
patagonian
and
i
m
much
mistaken
if
we
don
t
see
them
again
the
one
on
the
other
s
what
distance
are
we
from
the
atlantic
asked
the
major
about
forty
miles
at
the
outside
replied
paganel
and
now
friends
since
this
is
liberty
hall
i
beg
to
take
leave
of
you
i
am
going
to
choose
an
observatory
for
myself
up
there
and
by
the
help
of
my
telescope
let
you
know
how
things
are
going
on
in
the
forthwith
the
geographer
set
off
hoisting
himself
up
very
cleverly
from
bough
to
bough
till
he
disappeared
beyond
the
thick
foliage
his
companions
began
to
arrange
the
night
quarters
and
prepare
their
beds
but
this
was
neither
a
long
nor
difficult
task
and
very
soon
they
resumed
their
seats
round
the
fire
to
have
a
talk
as
usual
their
theme
was
captain
grant
in
three
days
should
the
water
subside
they
would
be
on
board
the
duncan
once
more
but
harry
grant
and
his
two
sailors
those
poor
shipwrecked
fellows
would
not
be
with
them
indeed
it
even
seemed
after
this
ill
success
and
this
useless
journey
across
america
that
all
chance
of
finding
them
was
gone
forever
where
could
they
commence
a
fresh
quest
what
grief
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
would
feel
on
hearing
there
was
no
further
hope
poor
sister
said
robert
it
is
all
up
with
for
the
first
time
glenarvan
could
not
find
any
comfort
to
give
him
what
could
he
say
to
the
lad
had
they
not
searched
exactly
where
the
document
stated
and
yet
he
said
this
degree
of
latitude
is
not
a
mere
figure
and
that
it
applies
to
the
shipwreck
or
captivity
of
harry
grant
is
no
mere
guess
or
supposition
we
read
it
with
our
own
all
very
true
your
honor
replied
tom
austin
and
yet
our
search
has
been
it
is
both
a
provoking
and
hopeless
business
replied
glenarvan
provoking
enough
certainly
said
the
major
but
not
hopeless
it
is
precisely
because
we
have
an
uncontestable
figure
provided
for
us
that
we
should
follow
it
up
to
the
what
do
you
mean
asked
glenarvan
what
more
can
we
do
a
very
logical
and
simple
thing
my
dear
edward
when
we
go
on
board
the
duncan
turn
her
beak
head
to
the
east
and
go
right
along
the
parallel
till
we
come
back
to
our
starting
point
if
do
you
suppose
that
i
have
not
thought
of
that
mcnabbs
replied
glenarvan
yes
a
hundred
times
but
what
chance
is
there
of
success
to
leave
the
american
continent
wouldn
t
it
be
to
go
away
from
the
very
spot
indicated
by
harry
grant
from
this
very
patagonia
so
distinctly
named
in
the
and
would
you
recommence
your
search
in
the
pampas
when
you
have
the
certainty
that
the
shipwreck
of
the
britannia
neither
occurred
on
the
coasts
of
the
pacific
nor
the
atlantic
glenarvan
was
silent
and
however
small
the
chance
of
finding
harry
grant
by
following
up
the
given
parallel
ought
we
not
to
try
i
don
t
say
no
replied
glenarvan
and
are
you
not
of
my
opinion
good
friends
added
the
major
addressing
the
sailors
entirely
said
tom
austin
while
mulrady
and
wilson
gave
an
assenting
nod
listen
to
me
friends
said
glenarvan
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
and
remember
robert
this
is
a
grave
discussion
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
find
captain
grant
i
am
pledged
to
it
and
will
devote
my
whole
life
to
the
task
if
needs
be
all
scotland
would
unite
with
me
to
save
so
devoted
a
son
as
he
has
been
to
her
i
too
quite
think
with
you
that
we
must
follow
the
parallel
round
the
globe
if
necessary
however
slight
our
chance
of
finding
him
but
that
is
not
the
question
we
have
to
settle
there
is
one
much
more
important
than
that
is
should
we
from
this
time
and
all
together
give
up
our
search
on
the
american
continent
no
one
made
any
reply
each
one
seemed
afraid
to
pronounce
the
word
well
resumed
glenarvan
addressing
himself
especially
to
the
major
my
dear
edward
replied
mcnabbs
it
would
be
incurring
too
great
a
responsibility
for
me
to
reply
et
it
is
a
question
which
requires
reflection
i
must
know
first
through
which
countries
the
parallel
of
southern
latitude
passes
that
s
paganel
s
business
he
will
tell
you
that
said
glenarvan
let
s
ask
him
then
replied
the
major
but
the
learned
geographer
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
was
hidden
among
the
thick
leafage
of
the
ombu
and
they
must
call
out
if
they
wanted
him
paganel
paganel
shouted
glenarvan
here
replied
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
clouds
where
are
you
in
my
what
are
you
doing
there
examining
the
wide
could
you
come
down
for
a
minute
do
you
want
me
what
for
to
know
what
countries
the
parallel
passes
that
s
easily
said
i
need
not
disturb
myself
to
come
down
for
very
well
tell
us
listen
then
after
leaving
america
the
parallel
crosses
the
atlantic
and
then
it
encounters
isle
tristan
d
it
goes
on
two
degrees
below
the
cape
of
good
and
afterwards
runs
across
the
indian
ocean
and
just
touches
isle
pierre
in
the
amsterdam
go
it
cuts
australia
by
the
province
of
and
after
leaving
australia
in
this
last
sentence
was
not
completed
was
the
geographer
hesitating
or
didn
t
he
know
what
to
say
no
but
a
terrible
cry
resounded
from
the
top
of
the
tree
glenarvan
and
his
friends
turned
pale
and
looked
at
each
other
what
fresh
catastrophe
had
happened
now
had
the
unfortunate
paganel
slipped
his
footing
already
wilson
and
mulrady
had
rushed
to
his
rescue
when
his
long
body
appeared
tumbling
down
from
branch
to
branch
but
was
he
living
or
dead
for
his
hands
made
no
attempt
to
seize
anything
to
stop
himself
a
few
minutes
more
and
he
would
have
fallen
into
the
roaring
waters
had
not
the
major
s
strong
arm
barred
his
passage
much
obliged
mcnabbs
said
paganel
how
s
this
what
is
the
matter
with
you
what
came
over
you
another
of
your
absent
yes
yes
replied
paganel
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
with
emotion
yes
but
this
was
something
what
was
it
i
said
we
had
made
a
mistake
we
are
making
it
still
and
have
been
all
explain
glenarvan
major
robert
my
friends
exclaimed
paganel
all
you
that
hear
me
we
are
looking
for
captain
grant
where
he
is
not
to
be
what
do
you
say
exclaimed
glenarvan
not
only
where
he
is
not
now
but
where
he
has
never
chapter
xxiv
paganel
s
disclosure
profound
astonishment
greeted
these
unexpected
words
of
the
learned
geographer
what
could
he
mean
had
he
lost
his
sense
he
spoke
with
such
conviction
however
that
all
eyes
turned
toward
glenarvan
for
paganel
s
affirmation
was
a
direct
answer
to
his
question
but
glenarvan
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
though
evidently
he
was
not
inclined
to
favor
his
friend
s
views
yes
began
paganel
again
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
himself
a
little
yes
we
have
gone
a
wrong
track
and
read
on
the
document
what
was
never
explain
yourself
paganel
said
the
major
and
more
calmly
if
you
the
thing
is
very
simple
major
like
you
i
was
in
error
like
you
i
had
rushed
at
a
false
interpretation
until
about
an
instant
ago
on
the
top
of
the
tree
when
i
was
answering
your
questions
just
as
i
pronounced
the
word
australia
a
sudden
flash
came
across
my
mind
and
the
document
became
clear
as
what
exclaimed
glenarvan
you
mean
to
say
that
harry
grant
i
mean
to
say
replied
paganel
that
the
word
austral
that
occurs
in
the
document
is
not
a
complete
word
as
we
have
supposed
up
till
now
but
just
the
root
of
the
word
well
that
would
be
strange
said
the
major
strange
repeated
glenarvan
shrugging
his
shoulders
it
is
simply
impossible
returned
paganel
that
is
a
word
we
don
t
allow
in
what
continued
glenarvan
in
a
tone
of
the
most
profound
incredulity
you
dare
to
contend
with
the
document
in
your
hand
that
the
shipwreck
of
the
britannia
happened
on
the
shores
of
i
am
sure
of
it
replied
paganel
my
conscience
exclaimed
glenarvan
i
must
say
i
am
surprised
at
such
a
declaration
from
the
secretary
of
a
geographical
society
and
why
so
said
paganel
touched
in
his
weak
point
because
if
you
allow
the
word
australie
you
must
also
allow
the
word
indiens
and
indians
are
never
seen
paganel
was
not
the
least
surprised
at
this
rejoinder
doubtless
he
expected
it
for
he
began
to
smile
and
said
my
dear
glenarvan
don
t
triumph
over
me
too
fast
i
am
going
to
floor
you
completely
and
never
was
an
englishman
more
thoroughly
defeated
than
you
will
be
it
will
be
the
revenge
for
cressy
and
i
wish
nothing
better
take
your
revenge
listen
then
in
the
text
of
the
document
there
is
neither
mention
of
the
indians
nor
of
patagonia
the
incomplete
word
indi
does
not
mean
indiens
but
of
course
indigenes
aborigines
now
do
you
admit
that
there
are
aborigines
in
australia
bravo
paganel
said
the
major
well
do
you
agree
to
my
interpretation
my
dear
lord
asked
the
geographer
again
yes
replied
glenarvan
if
you
will
prove
to
me
that
the
fragment
of
a
word
gonie
does
not
refer
to
the
country
of
the
certainly
it
does
not
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
patagonia
said
paganel
read
it
any
way
you
please
except
how
theogonie
agonie
said
the
major
i
don
t
care
which
returned
paganel
the
word
is
quite
unimportant
i
will
not
even
try
to
find
out
its
meaning
the
main
point
is
that
austral
means
australie
and
we
must
have
gone
blindly
on
a
wrong
track
not
to
have
discovered
the
explanation
at
the
very
beginning
it
was
so
evident
if
i
had
found
the
document
myself
and
my
judgment
had
not
been
misled
by
your
interpretation
i
should
never
have
read
it
a
burst
of
hurrahs
and
congratulations
and
compliments
followed
paganel
s
words
austin
and
the
sailors
and
the
major
and
robert
most
all
overjoyed
at
this
fresh
hope
applauded
him
heartily
while
even
glenarvan
whose
eyes
were
gradually
getting
open
was
almost
prepared
to
give
in
i
only
want
to
know
one
thing
more
my
dear
paganel
he
said
and
then
i
must
bow
to
your
what
is
it
how
will
you
group
the
words
together
according
to
your
new
interpretation
how
will
the
document
read
easily
enough
answered
here
is
the
document
replied
paganel
taking
out
the
precious
paper
he
had
been
studying
so
conscientiously
for
the
last
few
days
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
complete
silence
while
the
worthy
savant
took
time
to
collect
his
thoughts
before
complying
with
his
lordship
s
request
then
putting
his
finger
on
the
words
and
emphasizing
some
of
them
he
began
as
follows
britannia
de
glasgow
a
sombre
put
if
you
please
jours
trois
or
longue
it
doesn
t
signify
it
is
quite
a
matter
of
indifference
les

ou
ils

de

ils

ce
etc
is
that
clear
clear
enough
replied
glenarvan
if
the
word
continent
can
be
applied
to
australia
which
is
only
an
make
yourself
easy
about
that
my
dear
glenarvan
the
best
geographers
have
agreed
to
call
the
island
the
australian
then
all
i
have
now
to
say
is
my
friends
said
glenarvan
away
to
australia
and
may
heaven
help
us
to
australia
echoed
his
companions
with
one
voice
i
tell
you
what
paganel
added
glenarvan
your
being
on
board
the
duncan
is
a
perfect
all
right
look
on
me
as
a
messenger
of
providence
and
let
us
drop
the
so
the
conversation
ended
a
conversation
which
great
results
were
to
follow
it
completely
changed
the
moral
condition
of
the
travelers
it
gave
the
clew
of
the
labyrinth
in
which
they
had
thought
themselves
hopelessly
entangled
and
amid
their
ruined
projects
inspired
them
with
fresh
hope
they
could
now
quit
the
american
continent
without
the
least
hesitation
and
already
their
thoughts
had
flown
to
the
australias
in
going
on
board
the
duncan
again
they
would
not
bring
despair
with
them
and
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
would
not
have
to
mourn
the
irrevocable
loss
of
captain
grant
this
thought
so
filled
them
with
joy
that
they
forgot
all
the
dangers
of
their
actual
situation
and
only
regretted
that
they
could
not
start
immediately
it
was
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
they
determined
to
have
supper
at
six
paganel
wished
to
get
up
a
splendid
spread
in
honor
of
the
occasion
but
as
the
materials
were
very
scanty
he
proposed
to
robert
to
go
and
hunt
in
the
neighboring
forest
robert
clapped
his
hands
at
the
idea
so
they
took
thalcave
s
powder
flask
cleaned
the
revolvers
and
loaded
them
with
small
shot
and
set
off
don
t
go
too
far
said
the
major
gravely
to
the
two
hunters
after
their
departure
glenarvan
and
mcnabbs
went
down
to
examine
the
state
of
the
water
by
looking
at
the
notches
they
had
made
on
the
tree
and
wilson
and
mulrady
replenished
the
fire
no
sign
of
decrease
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
immense
lake
yet
the
flood
seemed
to
have
reached
its
maximum
height
but
the
violence
with
which
it
rushed
from
the
south
to
north
proved
that
the
equilibrium
of
the
argentine
rivers
was
not
restored
before
getting
lower
the
liquid
mass
must
remain
stationary
as
in
the
case
with
the
ocean
before
the
ebb
tide
commences
while
glenarvan
and
his
cousin
were
making
these
observations
the
report
of
firearms
resounded
frequently
above
their
heads
and
the
jubilant
outcries
of
the
two
sportsmen
for
paganel
was
every
whit
as
much
a
child
as
robert
they
were
having
a
fine
time
of
it
among
the
thick
leaves
judging
by
the
peals
of
laughter
which
rang
out
in
the
boy
s
clear
treble
voice
and
paganel
s
deep
bass
the
chase
was
evidently
successful
and
wonders
in
culinary
art
might
be
expected
wilson
had
a
good
idea
to
begin
with
which
he
had
skilfully
carried
out
for
when
glenarvan
came
back
to
the
brasier
he
found
that
the
brave
fellow
had
actually
managed
to
catch
with
only
a
pin
and
a
piece
of
string
several
dozen
small
fish
as
delicate
as
smelts
called
mojarras
which
were
all
jumping
about
in
a
fold
of
his
poncho
ready
to
be
converted
into
an
exquisite
dish
at
the
same
moment
the
hunters
reappeared
paganel
was
carefully
carrying
some
black
swallows
eggs
and
a
string
of
sparrows
which
he
meant
to
serve
up
later
under
the
name
of
field
larks
robert
had
been
clever
enough
to
bring
down
several
brace
of
hilgueros
small
green
and
yellow
birds
which
are
excellent
eating
and
greatly
in
demand
in
the
montevideo
market
paganel
who
knew
fifty
ways
of
dressing
eggs
was
obliged
for
this
once
to
be
content
with
simply
hardening
them
on
the
hot
embers
but
notwithstanding
this
the
viands
at
the
meal
were
both
dainty
and
varied
the
dried
beef
hard
eggs
grilled
mojarras
sparrows
and
roast
hilgueros
made
one
of
those
gala
feasts
the
memory
of
which
is
imperishable
the
conversation
was
very
animated
many
compliments
were
paid
paganel
on
his
twofold
talents
as
hunter
and
cook
which
the
savant
accepted
with
the
modesty
which
characterizes
true
merit
then
he
turned
the
conversation
on
the
peculiarities
of
the
ombu
under
whose
canopy
they
had
found
shelter
and
whose
depths
he
declared
were
immense
robert
and
i
he
added
jestingly
thought
ourselves
hunting
in
the
open
forest
i
was
afraid
for
the
minute
we
should
lose
ourselves
for
i
could
not
find
the
road
the
sun
was
sinking
below
the
horizon
i
sought
vainly
for
footmarks
i
began
to
feel
the
sharp
pangs
of
hunger
and
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
forest
resounded
already
with
the
roar
of
wild
beasts
no
not
that
there
are
no
wild
beasts
here
i
am
sorry
to
what
exclaimed
glenarvan
you
are
sorry
there
are
no
wild
beasts
certainly
i
and
yet
we
should
have
every
reason
to
dread
their
their
ferocity
is
scientifically
speaking
replied
the
learned
geographer
now
come
paganel
said
the
major
you
ll
never
make
me
admit
the
utility
of
wild
beasts
what
good
are
they
why
major
exclaimed
paganel
for
purposes
of
classification
into
orders
and
families
and
species
and
a
mighty
advantage
certainly
replied
mcnabbs
i
could
dispense
with
all
that
if
i
had
been
one
of
noah
s
companions
at
the
time
of
the
deluge
i
should
most
assuredly
have
hindered
the
imprudent
patriarch
from
putting
in
pairs
of
lions
and
tigers
and
panthers
and
bears
and
such
animals
for
they
are
as
malevolent
as
they
are
you
would
have
done
that
asked
paganel
yes
i
well
you
would
have
done
wrong
in
a
zoological
point
of
view
returned
paganel
but
not
in
a
humanitarian
one
rejoined
the
major
it
is
shocking
replied
paganel
why
for
my
part
on
the
contrary
i
should
have
taken
special
care
to
preserve
megatheriums
and
pterodactyles
and
all
the
antediluvian
species
of
which
we
are
unfortunately
deprived
by
his
and
i
say
returned
mcnabbs
that
noah
did
a
very
good
thing
when
he
abandoned
them
to
their
fate
that
is
if
they
lived
in
his
and
i
say
he
did
a
very
bad
thing
retorted
paganel
and
he
has
justly
merited
the
malediction
of
savants
to
the
end
of
time
the
rest
of
the
party
could
not
help
laughing
at
hearing
the
two
friends
disputing
over
old
noah
contrary
to
all
his
principles
the
major
who
all
his
life
had
never
disputed
with
anyone
was
always
sparring
with
paganel
the
geographer
seemed
to
have
a
peculiarly
exciting
effect
on
him
glenarvan
as
usual
always
the
peacemaker
interfered
in
the
debate
and
said
whether
the
loss
of
ferocious
animals
is
to
be
regretted
or
not
in
a
scientific
point
of
view
there
is
no
help
for
it
now
we
must
be
content
to
do
without
them
paganel
can
hardly
expect
to
meet
with
wild
beasts
in
this
aerial
why
not
asked
the
geographer
wild
beasts
on
a
tree
exclaimed
tom
austin
yes
undoubtedly
the
american
tiger
the
jaguar
takes
refuge
in
the
trees
when
the
chase
gets
too
hot
for
him
it
is
quite
possible
that
one
of
these
animals
surprised
by
the
inundation
might
have
climbed
up
into
this
ombu
and
be
hiding
now
among
its
thick
you
haven
t
met
any
of
them
at
any
rate
i
suppose
said
the
major
no
replied
paganel
though
we
hunted
all
through
the
wood
it
is
vexing
for
it
would
have
been
a
splendid
chase
a
jaguar
is
a
bloodthirsty
ferocious
creature
he
can
twist
the
neck
of
a
horse
with
a
single
stroke
of
his
paw
when
he
has
once
tasted
human
flesh
he
scents
it
greedily
he
likes
to
eat
an
indian
best
and
next
to
him
a
negro
then
a
mulatto
and
last
of
all
a
white
i
am
delighted
to
hear
we
come
number
four
said
mcnabbs
that
only
proves
you
are
insipid
retorted
paganel
with
an
air
of
disdain
i
am
delighted
to
be
insipid
was
the
major
s
reply
well
it
is
humiliating
enough
said
the
intractable
paganel
the
white
man
proclaimed
himself
chief
of
the
human
race
but
jaguar
is
of
a
different
opinion
it
be
that
as
it
may
my
brave
paganel
seeing
there
are
neither
indians
nor
negroes
nor
mulattoes
among
us
i
am
quite
rejoiced
at
the
absence
of
your
beloved
jaguars
our
situation
is
not
so
particularly
what
not
agreeable
exclaimed
paganel
jumping
at
the
word
as
likely
to
give
a
new
turn
to
the
conversation
you
are
complaining
of
your
lot
i
should
think
so
indeed
replied
glenarvan
do
you
find
these
uncomfortable
hard
branches
very
luxurious
i
have
never
been
more
comfortable
even
in
my
study
we
live
like
the
birds
we
sing
and
fly
about
i
begin
to
believe
men
were
intended
to
live
on
but
they
want
wings
suggested
the
major
they
ll
make
them
some
and
till
then
put
in
glenarvan
with
your
leave
i
prefer
the
gravel
of
a
park
or
the
floor
of
a
house
or
the
deck
of
a
ship
to
this
aerial
we
must
take
things
as
they
come
glenarvan
returned
paganel
if
good
so
much
the
better
if
bad
never
mind
ah
i
see
you
are
wishing
you
had
all
the
comforts
of
malcolm
no
but
i
am
quite
certain
robert
is
perfectly
happy
interrupted
paganel
eager
to
insure
one
partisan
at
least
yes
that
i
am
exclaimed
robert
in
a
joyous
tone
at
his
age
it
is
quite
natural
replied
glenarvan
and
at
mine
too
returned
the
geographer
the
fewer
one
s
comforts
the
fewer
one
s
needs
and
the
fewer
one
s
needs
the
greater
one
s
now
now
said
the
major
here
is
paganel
running
a
tilt
against
riches
and
gilt
no
mcnabbs
replied
the
savant
i
m
not
but
if
you
like
i
ll
tell
you
a
little
arabian
story
that
comes
into
my
mind
very
apropos
this
oh
do
do
said
robert
and
what
is
your
story
to
prove
paganel
inquired
the
major
much
what
all
stories
prove
my
brave
not
much
then
rejoined
mcnabbs
but
go
on
scheherazade
and
tell
us
the
there
was
once
said
paganel
a
son
of
the
great
who
was
unhappy
and
went
to
consult
an
old
dervish
the
old
sage
told
him
that
happiness
was
a
difficult
thing
to
find
in
this
world
however
he
added
i
know
an
infallible
means
of
procuring
your
what
is
it
asked
the
young
prince
it
is
to
put
the
shirt
of
a
happy
man
on
your
whereupon
the
prince
embraced
the
old
man
and
set
out
at
once
to
search
for
his
talisman
he
visited
all
the
capital
cities
in
the
world
he
tried
on
the
shirts
of
kings
and
emperors
and
princes
and
nobles
but
all
in
vain
he
could
not
find
a
man
among
them
that
was
happy
then
he
put
on
the
shirts
of
artists
and
warriors
and
merchants
but
these
were
no
better
by
this
time
he
had
traveled
a
long
way
without
finding
what
he
sought
at
last
he
began
to
despair
of
success
and
began
sorrowfully
to
retrace
his
steps
back
to
his
father
s
palace
when
one
day
he
heard
an
honest
peasant
singing
so
merrily
as
he
drove
the
plow
that
he
thought
surely
this
man
is
happy
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
happiness
on
forthwith
he
accosted
him
and
said
are
you
happy
yes
was
the
reply
there
is
nothing
you
desire
you
would
not
change
your
lot
for
that
of
a
king
never
well
then
sell
me
your
my
shirt
i
haven
t
one
chapter
xxv
between
fire
and
water
before
turning
into
their
nest
as
paganel
had
called
it
he
and
robert
and
glenarvan
climbed
up
into
the
observatory
to
have
one
more
inspection
of
the
liquid
plain
it
was
about
nine
o
clock
the
sun
had
just
sunk
behind
the
glowing
mists
of
the
western
horizon
the
eastern
horizon
was
gradually
assuming
a
most
stormy
aspect
a
thick
dark
bar
of
cloud
was
rising
higher
and
higher
and
by
degrees
extinguishing
the
stars
before
long
half
the
sky
was
overspread
evidently
motive
power
lay
in
the
cloud
itself
for
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
absolute
calm
reigned
in
the
atmosphere
not
a
leaf
stirred
on
the
tree
not
a
ripple
disturbed
the
surface
of
the
water
there
seemed
to
be
scarcely
any
air
even
as
though
some
vast
pneumatic
machine
had
rarefied
it
the
entire
atmosphere
was
charged
to
the
utmost
with
electricity
the
presence
of
which
sent
a
thrill
through
the
whole
nervous
system
of
all
animated
beings
we
are
going
to
have
a
storm
said
paganel
you
re
not
afraid
of
thunder
are
you
robert
asked
glenarvan
no
my
lord
exclaimed
robert
well
my
boy
so
much
the
better
for
a
storm
is
not
far
and
a
violent
one
too
added
paganel
if
i
may
judge
by
the
look
of
it
is
not
the
storm
i
care
about
said
glenarvan
so
much
as
the
torrents
of
rain
that
will
accompany
it
we
shall
be
soaked
to
the
skin
whatever
you
may
say
paganel
a
nest
won
t
do
for
a
man
and
you
will
learn
that
soon
to
your
with
the
help
of
philosophy
it
will
replied
paganel
philosophy
that
won
t
keep
you
from
getting
no
but
it
will
warm
well
said
glenarvan
we
had
better
go
down
to
our
friends
and
advise
them
to
wrap
themselves
up
in
their
philosophy
and
their
ponchos
as
tightly
as
possible
and
above
all
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
patience
for
we
shall
need
it
before
very
glenarvan
gave
a
last
glance
at
the
angry
sky
the
clouds
now
covered
it
entirely
only
a
dim
streak
of
light
shone
faintly
in
the
west
a
dark
shadow
lay
on
the
water
and
it
could
hardly
be
distinguished
from
the
thick
vapors
above
it
there
was
no
sensation
of
light
or
sound
all
was
darkness
and
silence
around
let
us
go
down
said
glenarvan
the
thunder
will
soon
burst
over
on
returning
to
the
bottom
of
the
tree
they
found
themselves
to
their
great
surprise
in
a
sort
of
dim
twilight
produced
by
myriads
of
luminous
specks
which
appeared
buzzing
confusedly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
it
is
phosphorescence
i
suppose
said
glenarvan
no
but
phosphorescent
insects
positive
living
diamonds
which
the
ladies
of
buenos
ayres
convert
into
magnificent
what
exclaimed
robert
those
sparks
flying
about
are
insects
yes
my
robert
caught
one
in
his
hand
and
found
paganel
was
right
it
was
a
kind
of
large
drone
an
inch
long
and
the
indians
call
it
this
curious
specimen
of
the
coleoptera
sheds
its
radiance
from
two
spots
in
the
front
of
its
and
the
light
is
sufficient
to
read
by
holding
his
watch
close
to
the
insect
paganel
saw
distinctly
that
the
time
was
on
rejoining
the
major
and
his
three
sailors
glenarvan
warned
them
of
the
approaching
storm
and
advised
them
to
secure
themselves
in
their
beds
of
branches
as
firmly
as
possible
for
there
was
no
doubt
that
after
the
first
clap
of
thunder
the
wind
would
become
unchained
and
the
ombu
would
be
violently
shaken
though
they
could
not
defend
themselves
from
the
waters
above
they
might
at
least
keep
out
of
the
rushing
current
beneath
they
wished
one
another
though
hardly
daring
to
hope
for
it
and
then
each
one
rolled
himself
in
his
poncho
and
lay
down
to
sleep
but
the
approach
of
the
great
phenomena
of
nature
excites
vague
uneasiness
in
the
heart
of
every
sentient
being
even
in
the
most
the
whole
party
in
the
ombu
felt
agitated
and
oppressed
and
not
one
of
them
could
close
his
eyes
the
first
peal
of
thunder
found
them
wide
awake
it
occurred
about
and
sounded
like
a
distant
rolling
glenarvan
ventured
to
creep
out
of
the
sheltering
foliage
and
made
his
way
to
the
extremity
of
the
horizontal
branch
to
take
a
look
round
the
deep
blackness
of
the
night
was
already
scarified
with
sharp
bright
lines
which
were
reflected
back
by
the
water
with
unerring
exactness
the
clouds
had
rent
in
many
parts
but
noiselessly
like
some
soft
cotton
material
after
attentively
observing
both
the
zenith
and
horizon
glenarvan
went
back
to
the
center
of
the
trunk
well
glenarvan
what
s
your
report
asked
paganel
i
say
it
is
beginning
in
good
earnest
and
if
it
goes
on
so
we
shall
have
a
terrible
so
much
the
better
replied
the
enthusiastic
paganel
i
should
like
a
grand
exhibition
since
we
can
t
run
that
s
another
of
your
theories
said
the
major
and
one
of
my
best
mcnabbs
i
am
of
glenarvan
s
opinion
that
the
storm
will
be
superb
just
a
minute
ago
when
i
was
trying
to
sleep
several
facts
occurred
to
my
memory
that
make
me
hope
it
will
for
we
are
in
the
region
of
great
electrical
tempests
for
instance
i
have
read
somewhere
that
in
in
this
very
province
of
buenos
ayres
lightning
struck
times
during
one
single
storm
my
colleague
martin
de
moussy
counted
minutes
of
uninterrupted
watch
in
hand
asked
the
major
watch
in
hand
only
one
thing
makes
me
uneasy
added
paganel
if
it
is
any
use
to
be
uneasy
and
that
is
that
the
culminating
point
of
this
plain
is
just
this
very
ombu
where
we
are
a
lightning
conductor
would
be
very
serviceable
to
us
at
present
for
it
is
this
tree
especially
among
all
that
grow
in
the
pampas
that
the
thunder
has
a
particular
affection
for
besides
i
need
not
tell
you
friend
that
learned
men
tell
us
never
to
take
refuge
under
trees
during
a
most
seasonable
advice
certainly
in
our
circumstances
said
the
major
i
must
confess
paganel
replied
glenarvan
that
you
might
have
chosen
a
better
time
for
this
reassuring
bah
replied
paganel
all
times
are
good
for
getting
information
ha
now
it
s
louder
peals
of
thunder
interrupted
this
inopportune
conversation
the
violence
increasing
with
the
noise
till
the
whole
atmosphere
seemed
to
vibrate
with
rapid
oscillations
the
incessant
flashes
of
lightning
took
various
forms
some
darted
down
perpendicularly
from
the
sky
five
or
six
times
in
the
same
place
in
succession
others
would
have
excited
the
interest
of
a
savant
to
the
highest
degree
for
though
arago
in
his
curious
statistics
only
cites
two
examples
of
forked
lightning
it
was
visible
here
hundreds
of
times
some
of
the
flashes
branched
out
in
a
thousand
different
directions
making
coralliform
zigzags
and
threw
out
wonderful
jets
of
arborescent
light
soon
the
whole
sky
from
east
to
north
seemed
supported
by
a
phosphoric
band
of
intense
brilliancy
this
kept
increasing
by
degrees
till
it
overspread
the
entire
horizon
kindling
the
clouds
which
were
faithfully
mirrored
in
the
waters
as
if
they
were
masses
of
combustible
material
beneath
and
presented
the
appearance
of
an
immense
globe
of
fire
the
center
of
which
was
the
ombu
glenarvan
and
his
companions
gazed
silently
at
this
terrifying
spectacle
they
could
not
make
their
voices
heard
but
the
sheets
of
white
light
which
enwrapped
them
every
now
and
then
revealed
the
face
of
one
and
another
sometimes
the
calm
features
of
the
major
sometimes
the
eager
curious
glance
of
paganel
or
the
energetic
face
of
glenarvan
and
at
others
the
scared
eyes
of
the
terrified
robert
and
the
careless
looks
of
the
sailors
investing
them
with
a
weird
spectral
aspect
however
as
yet
no
rain
had
fallen
and
the
wind
had
not
risen
in
the
least
but
this
state
of
things
was
of
short
duration
before
long
the
cataracts
of
the
sky
burst
forth
and
came
down
in
vertical
streams
as
the
large
drops
fell
splashing
into
the
lake
fiery
sparks
seemed
to
fly
out
from
the
illuminated
surface
was
the
rain
the
finale
of
the
storm
if
so
glenarvan
and
his
companions
would
escape
scot
free
except
for
a
few
vigorous
douche
baths
no
at
the
very
height
of
this
struggle
of
the
electric
forces
of
the
atmosphere
a
large
ball
of
fire
appeared
suddenly
at
the
extremity
of
the
horizontal
parent
branch
as
thick
as
a
man
s
wrist
and
surrounded
with
black
smoke
this
ball
after
turning
round
and
round
for
a
few
seconds
burst
like
a
bombshell
and
with
so
much
noise
that
the
explosion
was
distinctly
audible
above
the
general
fracas
a
sulphurous
smoke
filled
the
air
and
complete
silence
reigned
till
the
voice
of
tom
austin
was
heard
shouting
the
tree
is
on
tom
was
right
in
a
moment
as
if
some
fireworks
were
being
ignited
the
flame
ran
along
the
west
side
of
the
ombu
the
dead
wood
and
nests
of
dried
grass
and
the
whole
sap
which
was
of
a
spongy
texture
supplied
food
for
its
devouring
activity
the
wind
had
risen
now
and
fanned
the
flame
it
was
time
to
flee
and
glenarvan
and
his
party
hurried
away
to
the
eastern
side
of
their
refuge
which
was
meantime
untouched
by
the
fire
they
were
all
silent
troubled
and
terrified
as
they
watched
branch
after
branch
shrivel
and
crack
and
writhe
in
the
flame
like
living
serpents
and
then
drop
into
the
swollen
torrent
still
red
and
gleaming
as
it
was
borne
swiftly
along
on
the
rapid
current
the
flames
sometimes
rose
to
a
prodigious
height
and
seemed
almost
lost
in
the
atmosphere
and
sometimes
beaten
down
by
the
hurricane
closely
enveloped
the
ombu
like
a
robe
of
nessus
terror
seized
the
entire
group
they
were
almost
suffocated
with
smoke
and
scorched
with
the
unbearable
heat
for
the
conflagration
had
already
reached
the
lower
branches
on
their
side
of
the
ombu
to
extinguish
it
or
check
its
progress
was
impossible
and
they
saw
themselves
irrevocably
condemned
to
a
torturing
death
like
the
victims
of
hindoo
divinities
at
last
their
situation
was
absolutely
intolerable
of
the
two
deaths
staring
them
in
the
face
they
had
better
choose
the
less
cruel
to
the
water
exclaimed
glenarvan
wilson
who
was
nearest
the
flames
had
already
plunged
into
the
lake
but
next
minute
he
screamed
out
in
the
most
violent
terror
help
help
austin
rushed
toward
him
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
major
dragged
him
up
again
on
the
tree
what
s
the
matter
they
asked
alligators
alligators
replied
wilson
the
whole
foot
of
the
tree
appeared
to
be
surrounded
by
these
formidable
animals
of
the
saurian
order
by
the
glare
of
the
flames
they
were
immediately
recognized
by
paganel
as
the
ferocious
species
peculiar
to
america
called
caimans
in
the
spanish
territories
about
ten
of
them
were
there
lashing
the
water
with
their
powerful
tails
and
attacking
the
ombu
with
the
long
teeth
of
their
lower
jaw
at
this
sight
the
unfortunate
men
gave
themselves
up
to
be
lost
a
frightful
death
was
in
store
for
them
since
they
must
either
be
devoured
by
the
fire
or
by
the
caimans
even
the
major
said
in
a
calm
voice
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
there
are
circumstances
in
which
men
are
powerless
when
the
unchained
elements
can
only
be
combated
by
other
elements
glenarvan
gazed
with
haggard
looks
at
the
fire
and
water
leagued
against
him
hardly
knowing
what
deliverance
to
implore
from
heaven
the
violence
of
the
storm
had
abated
but
it
had
developed
in
the
atmosphere
a
considerable
quantity
of
vapors
to
which
electricity
was
about
to
communicate
immense
force
an
enormous
was
gradually
forming
in
the
south
a
cone
of
thick
mists
but
with
the
point
at
the
bottom
and
base
at
the
top
linking
together
the
turbulent
water
and
the
angry
clouds
this
meteor
soon
began
to
move
forward
turning
over
and
over
on
itself
with
dizzy
rapidity
and
sweeping
up
into
its
center
a
column
of
water
from
the
lake
while
its
gyratory
motions
made
all
the
surrounding
currents
of
air
rush
toward
it
a
few
seconds
more
and
the
gigantic
threw
itself
on
the
ombu
and
caught
it
up
in
its
whirl
the
tree
shook
to
its
roots
glenarvan
could
fancy
the
caimans
teeth
were
tearing
it
up
from
the
soil
for
as
he
and
his
companions
held
on
each
clinging
firmly
to
the
other
they
felt
the
towering
ombu
give
way
and
the
next
minute
it
fell
right
over
with
a
terrible
hissing
noise
as
the
flaming
branches
touched
the
foaming
water
it
was
the
work
of
an
instant
already
the
had
passed
to
carry
on
its
destructive
work
elsewhere
it
seemed
to
empty
the
lake
in
its
passage
by
continually
drawing
up
the
water
into
itself
the
ombu
now
began
to
drift
rapidly
along
impelled
by
wind
and
current
all
the
caimans
had
taken
their
departure
except
one
that
was
crawling
over
the
upturned
roots
and
coming
toward
the
poor
refugees
with
wide
open
jaws
but
mulrady
seizing
hold
of
a
branch
that
was
off
struck
the
monster
such
a
tremendous
blow
that
it
fell
back
into
the
torrent
and
disappeared
lashing
the
water
with
its
formidable
tail
glenarvan
and
his
companions
being
thus
delivered
from
the
voracious
saurians
stationed
themselves
on
the
branches
windward
of
the
conflagration
while
the
ombu
sailed
along
like
a
blazing
through
the
dark
night
the
flames
spreading
themselves
round
like
sails
before
the
breath
of
the
hurricane
chapter
xxvi
the
return
on
board
for
two
hours
the
ombu
navigated
the
immense
lake
without
reaching
the
flames
which
were
devouring
it
had
gradually
died
out
the
chief
danger
of
their
frightful
passage
was
thus
removed
and
the
major
went
the
length
of
saying
that
he
should
not
be
surprised
if
they
were
saved
after
all
the
direction
of
the
current
remained
unchanged
always
running
from
southwest
to
northeast
profound
darkness
had
again
set
in
only
illumined
here
and
there
by
a
parting
flash
of
lightning
the
storm
was
nearly
over
the
rain
had
given
place
to
light
mists
which
a
breath
of
wind
dispersed
and
the
heavy
masses
of
cloud
had
separated
and
now
streaked
the
sky
in
long
bands
the
ombu
was
borne
onward
so
rapidly
by
the
impetuous
torrent
that
anyone
might
have
supposed
some
powerful
locomotive
engine
was
hidden
in
its
trunk
it
seemed
likely
enough
they
might
continue
drifting
in
this
way
for
days
about
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
however
the
major
noticed
that
the
roots
were
beginning
to
graze
the
ground
occasionally
and
by
sounding
the
depth
of
the
water
with
a
long
branch
tom
austin
found
that
they
were
getting
on
rising
ground
twenty
minutes
afterward
the
ombu
stopped
short
with
a
violent
jolt
land
land
shouted
paganel
in
a
ringing
tone
the
extremity
of
the
calcined
bough
had
struck
some
hillock
and
never
were
sailors
more
glad
the
rock
to
them
was
the
port
already
robert
and
wilson
had
leaped
on
to
the
solid
plateau
with
a
loud
joyful
hurrah
when
a
whistle
was
heard
the
gallop
of
a
horse
resounded
over
the
plain
and
the
tall
form
of
thalcave
emerged
from
the
darkness
thalcave
thalcave
they
all
cried
with
one
voice
amigos
replied
the
patagonian
who
had
been
waiting
for
the
travelers
here
in
the
same
place
where
the
current
had
landed
himself
as
he
spoke
he
lifted
up
robert
in
his
arms
and
hugged
him
to
his
breast
never
imagining
that
paganel
was
hanging
on
to
him
a
general
and
hearty
followed
and
everyone
rejoiced
at
seeing
their
faithful
guide
again
then
the
patagonian
led
the
way
into
the
hangar
of
a
deserted
estancia
where
there
was
a
good
blazing
fire
to
warm
them
and
a
substantial
meal
of
fine
juicy
slices
of
venison
soon
broiling
of
which
they
did
not
leave
a
crumb
when
their
minds
had
calmed
down
a
little
and
they
were
able
to
reflect
on
the
dangers
they
had
come
through
from
flood
and
fire
and
alligators
they
could
scarcely
believe
they
had
escaped
thalcave
in
a
few
words
gave
paganel
an
account
of
himself
since
they
parted
entirely
ascribing
his
deliverance
to
his
intrepid
horse
then
paganel
tried
to
make
him
understand
their
new
interpretation
of
the
document
and
the
consequent
hopes
they
were
indulging
whether
the
indian
actually
understood
his
ingenious
hypothesis
was
a
question
but
he
saw
that
they
were
glad
and
confident
and
that
was
enough
for
him
as
can
easily
be
imagined
after
their
compulsory
rest
on
the
ombu
the
travelers
were
up
betimes
and
ready
to
start
at
eight
o
clock
they
set
off
no
means
of
transport
being
procurable
so
far
south
they
were
compelled
to
walk
however
it
was
not
more
than
forty
miles
now
that
they
had
to
go
and
thaouka
would
not
refuse
to
give
a
lift
occasionally
to
a
tired
pedestrian
or
even
to
a
couple
at
a
pinch
in
hours
they
might
reach
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
the
tract
of
marshy
ground
still
under
water
soon
lay
behind
them
as
thalcave
led
them
upward
to
the
higher
plains
here
the
argentine
territory
resumed
its
monotonous
aspect
a
few
clumps
of
trees
planted
by
european
hands
might
chance
to
be
visible
among
the
pasturage
but
quite
as
rarely
as
in
tandil
and
tapalquem
sierras
the
native
trees
are
only
found
on
the
edge
of
long
prairies
and
about
cape
corrientes
next
day
though
still
fifteen
miles
distant
the
proximity
of
the
ocean
was
sensibly
felt
the
virazon
a
peculiar
wind
which
blows
regularly
half
of
the
day
and
night
bent
down
the
heads
of
the
tall
grasses
thinly
planted
woods
rose
to
view
and
small
mimosas
bushes
of
acacia
and
tufts
of
here
and
there
shining
like
pieces
of
broken
glass
were
salinous
lagoons
which
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
journey
as
the
travelers
had
to
wind
round
them
to
get
past
they
pushed
on
as
quickly
as
possible
hoping
to
reach
lake
salado
on
the
shores
of
the
ocean
the
same
day
and
at
when
they
found
themselves
in
front
of
the
sand
hills
two
hundred
feet
high
which
skirt
the
coast
they
were
all
tolerably
tired
but
when
the
long
murmur
of
the
distant
ocean
fell
on
their
ears
the
exhausted
men
forgot
their
fatigue
and
ran
up
the
sandhills
with
surprising
agility
but
it
was
getting
quite
dark
already
and
their
eager
gaze
could
discover
no
traces
of
the
duncan
on
the
gloomy
expanse
of
water
that
met
their
sight
but
she
is
there
for
all
that
exclaimed
glenarvan
waiting
for
us
and
running
we
shall
see
her
replied
mcnabbs
tom
austin
hailed
the
invisible
yacht
but
there
was
no
response
the
wind
was
very
high
and
the
sea
rough
the
clouds
were
scudding
along
from
the
west
and
the
spray
of
the
waves
dashed
up
even
to
the
it
was
little
wonder
then
if
the
man
on
the
could
neither
hear
nor
make
himself
heard
supposing
the
duncan
were
there
there
was
no
shelter
on
the
coast
for
her
neither
bay
nor
cove
nor
port
not
so
much
as
a
creek
the
shore
was
composed
of
which
ran
out
into
the
sea
and
were
more
dangerous
to
approach
than
rocky
shoals
the
irritate
the
waves
and
make
the
sea
so
particularly
rough
that
in
heavy
weather
vessels
that
run
aground
there
are
invariably
dashed
to
pieces
though
then
the
duncan
would
keep
far
away
from
such
a
coast
john
mangles
is
a
prudent
captain
to
get
near
tom
austin
however
was
of
the
opinion
that
she
would
be
able
to
keep
five
miles
out
the
major
advised
his
impatient
relative
to
restrain
himself
to
circumstances
since
there
was
no
means
of
dissipating
the
darkness
what
was
the
use
of
straining
his
eyes
by
vainly
endeavoring
to
pierce
through
it
he
set
to
work
immediately
to
prepare
the
night
s
encampment
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
the
last
provisions
supplied
the
last
meal
and
afterward
each
following
the
major
s
example
scooped
out
a
hole
in
the
sand
which
made
a
comfortable
enough
bed
and
then
covered
himself
with
the
soft
material
up
to
his
chin
and
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
but
glenarvan
kept
watch
there
was
still
a
stiff
breeze
of
wind
and
the
ocean
had
not
recovered
its
equilibrium
after
the
recent
storm
the
waves
at
all
times
tumultuous
now
broke
over
the
with
a
noise
like
thunder
glenarvan
could
not
rest
knowing
the
duncan
was
so
near
him
as
to
supposing
she
had
not
arrived
at
the
appointed
rendezvous
that
was
out
of
the
question
glenarvan
had
left
the
bay
of
talcahuano
on
the
of
october
and
arrived
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
on
the
of
november
he
had
taken
thirty
days
to
cross
chili
the
cordilleras
the
pampas
and
the
argentine
plains
giving
the
duncan
ample
time
to
double
cape
horn
and
arrive
on
the
opposite
side
for
such
a
fast
runner
there
were
no
impediments
certainly
the
storm
had
been
very
violent
and
its
fury
must
have
been
terrible
on
such
a
vast
battlefield
as
the
atlantic
but
the
yacht
was
a
good
ship
and
the
captain
was
a
good
sailor
he
was
bound
to
be
there
and
he
would
be
there
these
reflections
however
did
not
calm
glenarvan
when
the
heart
and
the
reason
are
struggling
it
is
generally
the
heart
that
wins
the
mastery
the
laird
of
malcolm
castle
felt
the
presence
of
loved
ones
about
him
in
the
darkness
as
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
lonely
strand
he
gazed
and
listened
and
even
fancied
he
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
a
faint
light
i
am
not
mistaken
he
said
to
himself
i
saw
a
ship
s
light
one
of
the
lights
on
the
duncan
oh
why
can
t
i
see
in
the
dark
all
at
once
the
thought
rushed
across
him
that
paganel
said
he
was
a
nyctalope
and
could
see
at
night
he
must
go
and
wake
him
the
learned
geographer
was
sleeping
as
sound
as
a
mole
a
strong
arm
pulled
him
up
out
of
the
sand
and
made
him
call
out
who
goes
there
it
is
i
who
glenarvan
come
i
need
your
my
eyes
replied
paganel
rubbing
them
vigorously
yes
i
need
your
eyes
to
make
out
the
duncan
in
this
darkness
so
confound
the
nyctalopia
said
paganel
inwardly
though
delighted
to
be
of
any
service
to
his
friend
he
got
up
and
shook
his
stiffened
limbs
and
stretching
and
yawning
as
most
people
do
when
roused
from
sleep
followed
glenarvan
to
the
beach
glenarvan
begged
him
to
examine
the
distant
horizon
across
the
sea
which
he
did
most
conscientiously
for
some
minutes
well
do
you
see
nothing
asked
glenarvan
not
a
thing
even
a
cat
couldn
t
see
two
steps
before
look
for
a
red
light
or
a
green
one
her
larboard
or
starboard
i
see
neither
a
red
nor
a
green
light
all
is
pitch
dark
replied
paganel
his
eyes
involuntarily
beginning
to
close
for
half
an
hour
he
followed
his
impatient
friend
mechanically
letting
his
head
frequently
drop
on
his
chest
and
raising
it
again
with
a
start
at
last
he
neither
answered
nor
spoke
and
he
reeled
about
like
a
drunken
man
glenarvan
looked
at
him
and
found
he
was
sound
asleep
without
attempting
to
wake
him
he
took
his
arm
led
him
back
to
his
hole
and
buried
him
again
comfortably
at
dawn
next
morning
all
the
slumberers
started
to
their
feet
and
rushed
to
the
shore
shouting
hurrah
hurrah
as
lord
glenarvan
s
loud
cry
the
duncan
the
duncan
broke
upon
his
ear
there
she
was
five
miles
out
her
courses
carefully
reefed
and
her
steam
half
up
her
smoke
was
lost
in
the
morning
mist
the
sea
was
so
violent
that
a
vessel
of
her
tonnage
could
not
have
ventured
safely
nearer
the
glenarvan
by
the
aid
of
paganel
s
telescope
closely
observed
the
movements
of
the
yacht
it
was
evident
that
john
mangles
had
not
perceived
his
passengers
for
he
continued
his
course
as
before
but
at
this
very
moment
thalcave
fired
his
carbine
in
the
direction
of
the
yacht
they
listened
and
looked
but
no
signal
of
recognition
was
returned
a
second
and
a
third
time
the
indian
fired
awakening
the
echoes
among
the
at
last
a
white
smoke
was
seen
issuing
from
the
side
of
the
yacht
they
see
us
exclaimed
glenarvan
that
s
the
cannon
of
the
a
few
seconds
and
the
heavy
boom
of
the
cannon
came
across
the
water
and
died
away
on
the
shore
the
sails
were
instantly
altered
and
the
steam
got
up
so
as
to
get
as
near
the
coast
as
possible
presently
through
the
glass
they
saw
a
boat
lowered
lady
helena
will
not
be
able
to
come
said
tom
austin
it
is
too
nor
john
mangles
added
mcnabbs
he
can
not
leave
the
my
sister
my
sister
cried
robert
stretching
out
his
arms
toward
the
yacht
which
was
now
rolling
violently
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
get
on
board
said
glenarvan
patience
edward
you
will
be
there
in
a
couple
of
hours
replied
the
major
two
hours
but
it
was
impossible
for
a
boat
a
one
to
come
and
go
in
a
shorter
space
of
time
glenarvan
went
back
to
thalcave
who
stood
beside
thaouka
with
his
arms
crossed
looking
quietly
at
the
troubled
waves
glenarvan
took
his
hand
and
pointing
to
the
yacht
said
come
the
indian
gently
shook
his
head
come
friend
repeated
glenarvan
no
said
thalcave
gently
here
is
thaouka
and
there
the
pampas
he
added
embracing
with
a
passionate
gesture
the
prairies
glenarvan
understood
his
refusal
he
knew
that
the
indian
would
never
forsake
the
prairie
where
the
bones
of
his
fathers
were
whitening
and
he
knew
the
religious
attachment
of
these
sons
of
the
desert
for
their
native
land
he
did
not
urge
thalcave
longer
therefore
but
simply
pressed
his
hand
nor
could
he
find
it
in
his
heart
to
insist
when
the
indian
smiling
as
usual
would
not
accept
the
price
of
his
services
pushing
back
the
money
and
saying
for
the
sake
of
glenarvan
could
not
reply
but
he
wished
at
least
to
leave
the
brave
fellow
some
souvenir
of
his
european
friends
what
was
there
to
give
however
arms
horses
everything
had
been
destroyed
in
the
unfortunate
inundation
and
his
friends
were
no
richer
than
himself
he
was
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
show
his
recognition
of
the
disinterestedness
of
this
noble
guide
when
a
happy
thought
struck
him
he
had
an
exquisite
portrait
of
lady
helena
in
his
pocket
a
oeuvre
of
lawrence
this
he
drew
out
and
offered
to
thalcave
simply
saying
my
the
indian
gazed
at
it
with
a
softened
eye
and
said
good
and
then
robert
and
paganel
and
the
major
and
the
rest
exchanged
touching
farewells
with
the
faithful
patagonian
thalcave
embraced
them
each
and
pressed
them
to
his
broad
chest
paganel
made
him
accept
a
map
of
south
america
and
the
two
oceans
which
he
had
often
seen
the
indian
looking
at
with
interest
it
was
the
most
precious
thing
the
geographer
possessed
as
for
robert
he
had
only
caresses
to
bestow
and
these
he
lavished
on
his
friend
not
forgetting
to
give
a
share
to
thaouka
the
boat
from
the
duncan
was
now
fast
approaching
and
in
another
minute
had
glided
into
a
narrow
channel
between
the
and
run
ashore
my
wife
were
glenarvan
s
first
words
my
sister
said
robert
lady
helena
and
miss
grant
are
waiting
for
you
on
board
replied
the
coxswain
but
lose
no
time
your
honor
we
have
not
a
minute
for
the
tide
is
beginning
to
ebb
the
last
kindly
adieux
were
spoken
and
thalcave
accompanied
his
friends
to
the
boat
which
had
been
pushed
back
into
the
water
just
as
robert
was
going
to
step
in
the
indian
took
him
in
his
arms
and
gazed
tenderly
into
his
face
then
he
said
now
go
you
are
a
friend
said
glenarvan
once
more
shall
we
never
see
each
other
again
paganel
called
out
sabe
who
knows
replied
thalcave
lifting
his
arms
toward
heaven
these
were
the
indian
s
last
words
dying
away
on
the
breeze
as
the
boat
receded
gradually
from
the
shore
for
a
long
time
his
dark
motionless
silhouette
stood
out
against
the
sky
through
the
white
dashing
spray
of
the
waves
then
by
degrees
his
tall
form
began
to
diminish
in
size
till
at
last
his
friends
of
a
day
lost
sight
of
him
altogether
an
hour
afterward
robert
was
the
first
to
leap
on
board
the
duncan
he
flung
his
arms
round
mary
s
neck
amid
the
loud
joyous
hurrahs
of
the
crew
on
the
yacht
thus
the
journey
across
south
america
was
accomplished
the
given
line
of
march
being
scrupulously
adhered
to
throughout
neither
mountains
nor
rivers
had
made
the
travelers
change
their
course
and
though
they
had
not
had
to
encounter
any
from
men
their
generous
intrepidity
had
been
often
enough
roughly
put
to
the
proof
by
the
fury
of
the
unchained
elements

page
intentionally
blank
chapter
i
a
new
destination
for
the
first
few
moments
the
joy
of
reunion
completely
filled
the
hearts
lord
glenarvan
had
taken
care
that
the
of
their
expedition
should
not
throw
a
gloom
over
the
pleasure
of
meeting
his
very
first
words
being
cheer
up
friends
cheer
up
captain
grant
is
not
with
us
but
we
have
a
certainty
of
finding
him
only
such
an
assurance
as
this
would
have
restored
hope
to
those
on
board
the
duncan
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
had
been
sorely
tried
by
the
suspense
as
they
stood
on
the
poop
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
boat
and
trying
to
count
the
number
of
its
passengers
alternate
hope
and
fear
agitated
the
bosom
of
poor
mary
sometimes
she
fancied
she
could
see
her
father
harry
grant
and
sometimes
she
gave
way
to
despair
her
heart
throbbed
violently
she
could
not
speak
and
indeed
could
scarcely
stand
lady
helena
put
her
arm
round
her
waist
to
support
her
but
the
captain
john
mangles
who
stood
close
beside
them
spoke
no
encouraging
word
for
his
practiced
eye
saw
plainly
that
the
captain
was
not
there
he
is
there
he
is
coming
oh
father
exclaimed
the
young
girl
but
as
the
boat
came
nearer
her
illusion
was
dispelled
all
hope
forsook
her
and
she
would
have
sunk
in
despair
but
for
the
reassuring
voice
of
glenarvan
after
their
mutual
embraces
were
over
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
and
john
mangles
were
informed
of
the
principal
incidents
of
the
expedition
and
especially
of
the
new
interpretation
of
the
document
due
to
the
sagacity
of
jacques
paganel
his
lordship
also
spoke
in
the
most
eulogistic
terms
of
robert
of
whom
mary
might
well
be
proud
his
courage
and
devotion
and
the
dangers
he
had
run
were
all
shown
up
in
strong
relief
by
his
patron
till
the
modest
boy
did
not
know
which
way
to
look
and
was
obliged
to
hide
his
burning
cheeks
in
his
sister
s
arms
no
need
to
blush
robert
said
john
mangles
your
conduct
has
been
worthy
of
your
and
he
leaned
over
the
boy
and
pressed
his
lips
on
his
cheek
still
wet
with
mary
s
tears
the
major
and
paganel
it
need
hardly
be
said
came
in
for
their
due
share
of
welcome
and
lady
helena
only
regretted
she
could
not
shake
hands
with
the
brave
and
generous
thalcave
mcnabbs
soon
slipped
away
to
his
cabin
and
began
to
shave
himself
as
coolly
and
composedly
as
possible
while
paganel
flew
here
and
there
like
a
bee
sipping
the
sweets
of
compliments
and
smiles
he
wanted
to
embrace
everyone
on
board
the
yacht
and
beginning
with
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
wound
up
with
olbinett
the
steward
who
could
only
acknowledge
so
polite
an
attention
by
announcing
that
breakfast
was
ready
breakfast
exclaimed
paganel
yes
monsieur
a
real
breakfast
on
a
real
table
with
a
cloth
and
napkins
certainly
monsieur
and
we
shall
neither
have
charqui
nor
hard
eggs
nor
fillets
of
ostrich
oh
monsieur
said
olbinett
in
an
aggrieved
tone
i
don
t
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
my
friend
said
the
geographer
smiling
but
for
a
month
that
has
been
our
usual
bill
of
fare
and
when
we
dined
we
stretched
ourselves
full
length
on
the
ground
unless
we
sat
astride
on
the
trees
consequently
the
meal
you
have
just
announced
seemed
to
me
like
a
dream
or
fiction
or
well
monsieur
paganel
come
along
and
let
us
prove
its
reality
said
lady
helena
who
could
not
help
laughing
take
my
arm
replied
the
gallant
geographer
has
his
lordship
any
orders
to
give
me
about
the
duncan
asked
john
mangles
after
breakfast
john
replied
glenarvan
we
ll
discuss
the
program
of
our
new
expedition
olbinett
s
breakfast
seemed
quite
a
fete
to
the
hungry
guests
it
was
pronounced
excellent
and
even
superior
to
the
festivities
of
the
pampas
paganel
was
helped
twice
to
each
dish
through
absence
of
mind
he
said
this
unlucky
word
reminded
lady
helena
of
the
amiable
frenchman
s
propensity
and
made
her
ask
if
he
had
ever
fallen
into
his
old
habits
while
they
were
away
the
major
and
glenarvan
exchanged
smiling
glances
and
paganel
burst
out
laughing
and
protested
on
his
honor
that
he
would
never
be
caught
tripping
again
once
more
during
the
whole
voyage
after
this
prelude
he
gave
an
amusing
recital
of
his
disastrous
mistake
in
learning
spanish
and
his
profound
study
of
camoens
after
all
he
added
it
s
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
and
i
don
t
regret
the
why
not
my
worthy
friend
asked
the
major
because
i
not
only
know
spanish
but
portuguese
i
can
speak
two
languages
instead
of
upon
my
word
i
never
thought
of
that
said
mcnabbs
my
compliments
paganel
my
sincere
but
paganel
was
too
busily
engaged
with
his
knife
and
fork
to
lose
a
single
mouthful
though
he
did
his
best
to
eat
and
talk
at
the
same
time
he
was
so
much
taken
up
with
his
plate
however
that
one
little
fact
quite
escaped
his
observation
though
glenarvan
noticed
it
at
once
this
was
that
john
mangles
had
grown
particularly
attentive
to
mary
grant
a
significant
glance
from
lady
helena
told
him
moreover
how
affairs
stood
and
inspired
him
with
affectionate
sympathy
for
the
young
lovers
but
nothing
of
this
was
apparent
in
his
manner
to
john
for
his
next
question
was
what
sort
of
a
voyage
he
had
made
we
could
not
have
had
a
better
but
i
must
apprise
your
lordship
that
i
did
not
go
through
the
straits
of
magellan
what
you
doubled
cape
horn
and
i
was
not
there
exclaimed
paganel
hang
yourself
said
the
major
selfish
fellow
you
advise
me
to
do
that
because
you
want
my
rope
retorted
the
geographer
well
you
see
my
dear
paganel
unless
you
have
the
gift
of
ubiquity
you
can
t
be
in
two
places
at
once
while
you
were
scouring
the
pampas
you
could
not
be
doubling
cape
that
doesn
t
prevent
my
regretting
it
replied
paganel
here
the
subject
dropped
and
john
continued
his
account
of
his
voyage
on
arriving
at
cape
pilares
he
had
found
the
winds
dead
against
him
and
therefore
made
for
the
south
coasting
along
the
desolation
isle
and
after
going
as
far
as
the
degree
southern
latitude
had
doubled
cape
horn
passed
by
terra
del
fuego
and
the
straits
of
lemaire
keeping
close
to
the
patagonian
shore
at
cape
corrientes
they
encountered
the
terrible
storm
which
had
handled
the
travelers
across
the
pampas
so
roughly
but
the
yacht
had
borne
it
bravely
and
for
the
last
three
days
had
stood
right
out
to
sea
till
the
welcome
of
the
expedition
was
heard
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
party
it
was
only
justice
the
captain
added
that
he
should
mention
the
intrepid
bearing
of
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
throughout
the
whole
hurricane
they
had
not
shown
the
least
fear
unless
for
their
friends
who
might
possibly
be
exposed
to
the
fury
of
the
after
john
mangles
had
finished
his
narrative
glenarvan
turned
to
mary
and
said
my
dear
miss
mary
the
captain
has
been
doing
homage
to
your
noble
qualities
and
i
am
glad
to
think
you
are
not
unhappy
on
board
his
how
could
i
be
replied
mary
naively
looking
at
lady
helena
and
at
the
young
captain
too
likely
enough
oh
my
sister
is
very
fond
of
you
john
and
so
am
i
exclaimed
robert
and
so
am
i
of
you
my
dear
boy
returned
the
captain
a
little
abashed
by
robert
s
innocent
avowal
which
had
kindled
a
faint
blush
on
mary
s
cheek
then
he
managed
to
turn
the
conversation
to
safer
topics
by
saying
and
now
that
your
lordship
has
heard
all
about
the
doings
of
the
duncan
perhaps
you
will
give
us
some
details
of
your
own
journey
and
tell
us
more
about
the
exploits
of
our
young
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
such
a
recital
to
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
and
accordingly
lord
glenarvan
hastened
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
going
over
incident
by
incident
the
entire
march
from
one
ocean
to
another
the
pass
of
the
andes
the
earthquake
the
disappearance
of
robert
his
capture
by
the
condor
thalcave
s
providential
shot
the
episode
of
the
red
wolves
the
devotion
of
the
young
lad
sergeant
manuel
the
inundations
the
caimans
the
waterspout
the
night
on
the
atlantic
shore
all
these
details
amusing
or
terrible
excited
by
turns
laughter
and
horror
in
the
listeners
often
and
often
robert
came
in
for
caresses
from
his
sister
and
lady
helena
never
was
a
boy
so
much
embraced
or
by
such
enthusiastic
friends
and
now
friends
added
lord
glenarvan
when
he
had
finished
his
narrative
we
must
think
of
the
present
the
past
is
gone
but
the
future
is
ours
let
us
come
back
to
captain
harry
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
they
all
went
into
lord
glenarvan
s
private
cabin
and
seated
themselves
round
a
table
covered
with
charts
and
plans
to
talk
over
the
matter
fully
my
dear
helena
said
lord
glenarvan
i
told
you
when
we
came
on
board
a
little
while
ago
that
though
we
had
not
brought
back
captain
grant
our
hope
of
finding
him
was
stronger
than
ever
the
result
of
our
journey
across
america
is
this
we
have
reached
the
conviction
or
rather
absolute
certainty
that
the
shipwreck
never
occurred
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
nor
pacific
the
natural
inference
is
that
as
far
as
regards
patagonia
our
interpretation
of
the
document
was
erroneous
most
fortunately
our
friend
paganel
in
a
happy
moment
of
inspiration
discovered
the
mistake
he
has
proved
clearly
that
we
have
been
on
the
wrong
track
and
so
explained
the
document
that
all
doubt
whatever
is
removed
from
our
minds
however
as
the
document
is
in
french
i
will
ask
paganel
to
go
over
it
for
your
the
learned
geographer
thus
called
upon
executed
his
task
in
the
most
convincing
manner
descanting
on
the
syllables
gonie
and
indi
and
extracting
australia
out
of
austral
he
pointed
out
that
captain
grant
on
leaving
the
coast
of
peru
to
return
to
europe
might
have
been
carried
away
with
his
disabled
ship
by
the
southern
currents
of
the
pacific
right
to
the
shores
of
australia
and
his
hypotheses
were
so
ingenious
and
his
deductions
so
subtle
that
even
the
john
mangles
a
difficult
judge
and
most
unlikely
to
be
led
away
by
any
flights
of
imagination
was
completely
satisfied
at
the
conclusion
of
paganel
s
dissertation
glenarvan
announced
that
the
duncan
would
sail
immediately
for
australia
but
before
the
decisive
orders
were
given
mcnabbs
asked
for
a
few
minutes
hearing
say
away
mcnabbs
replied
glenarvan
i
have
no
intention
of
weakening
the
arguments
of
my
friend
paganel
and
still
less
of
refuting
them
i
consider
them
wise
and
weighty
and
deserving
our
attention
and
think
them
justly
entitled
to
form
the
basis
of
our
future
researches
but
still
i
should
like
them
to
be
submitted
to
a
final
examination
in
order
to
make
their
worth
incontestable
and
go
on
major
said
paganel
i
am
ready
to
answer
all
your
they
are
simple
enough
as
you
will
see
five
months
ago
when
we
left
the
clyde
we
had
studied
these
same
documents
and
their
interpretation
then
appeared
quite
plain
no
other
coast
but
the
western
coast
of
patagonia
could
possibly
we
thought
have
been
the
scene
of
the
shipwreck
we
had
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
on
the
that
s
true
replied
glenarvan
a
little
later
continued
the
major
when
a
providential
fit
of
absence
of
mind
came
over
paganel
and
brought
him
on
board
the
yacht
the
documents
were
submitted
to
him
and
he
approved
our
plan
of
search
most
i
do
not
deny
it
said
paganel
and
yet
we
were
mistaken
resumed
the
major
yes
we
were
mistaken
returned
paganel
but
it
is
only
human
to
make
a
mistake
while
to
persist
in
it
a
man
must
be
a
stop
paganel
don
t
excite
yourself
i
don
t
mean
to
say
that
we
should
prolong
our
search
in
what
is
it
then
that
you
want
asked
glenarvan
a
confession
nothing
more
a
confession
that
australia
now
as
evidently
appears
to
be
the
theater
of
the
shipwreck
of
the
britannia
as
america
did
we
confess
it
willingly
replied
paganel
very
well
then
since
that
is
the
case
my
advice
is
not
to
let
your
imagination
rely
on
successive
and
contradictory
evidence
who
knows
whether
after
australia
some
other
country
may
not
appear
with
equal
certainty
to
be
the
place
and
we
may
have
to
recommence
our
search
glenarvan
and
paganel
looked
at
each
other
silently
struck
by
the
justice
of
these
remarks
i
should
like
you
therefore
continued
the
major
before
we
actually
start
for
australia
to
make
one
more
examination
of
the
documents
here
they
are
and
here
are
the
charts
let
us
take
up
each
point
in
succession
through
which
the
parallel
passes
and
see
if
we
come
across
any
other
country
which
would
agree
with
the
precise
indications
of
the
nothing
can
be
more
easily
and
quickly
done
replied
paganel
for
countries
are
not
very
numerous
in
this
latitude
well
look
said
the
major
displaying
an
english
planisphere
on
the
plan
of
mercator
s
chart
and
presenting
the
appearance
of
a
terrestrial
globe
he
placed
it
before
lady
helena
and
then
they
all
stood
round
so
as
to
be
able
to
follow
the
argument
of
paganel
as
i
have
said
already
resumed
the
learned
geographer
after
having
crossed
south
america
the
degree
of
latitude
cuts
the
islands
of
tristan
d
acunha
now
i
maintain
that
none
of
the
words
of
the
document
could
relate
to
these
the
documents
were
examined
with
the
most
minute
care
and
the
conclusion
unanimously
reached
was
that
these
islands
were
entirely
out
of
the
question
let
us
go
on
then
resumed
paganel
after
leaving
the
atlantic
we
pass
two
degrees
below
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
into
the
indian
ocean
only
one
group
of
islands
is
found
on
this
route
the
amsterdam
isles
now
then
we
must
examine
these
as
we
did
the
tristan
d
acunha
after
a
close
survey
the
amsterdam
isles
were
rejected
in
their
turn
not
a
single
word
or
part
of
a
word
french
english
or
german
could
apply
to
this
group
in
the
indian
ocean
now
we
come
to
australia
continued
paganel
the
parallel
touches
this
continent
at
cape
bernouilli
and
leaves
it
at
twofold
bay
you
will
agree
with
me
that
without
straining
the
text
the
english
word
stra
and
the
french
one
austral
may
relate
to
australia
the
thing
is
too
plain
to
need
the
conclusion
of
paganel
met
with
unanimous
approval
every
probability
was
in
his
favor
and
where
is
the
next
point
asked
mcnabbs
that
is
easily
answered
after
leaving
twofold
bay
we
cross
an
arm
of
the
sea
which
extends
to
new
zealand
here
i
must
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
french
word
contin
means
a
continent
irrefragably
captain
grant
could
not
then
have
found
refuge
in
new
zealand
which
is
only
an
island
however
that
may
be
though
examine
and
compare
and
go
over
and
over
each
word
and
see
if
by
any
possibility
they
can
be
made
to
fit
this
new
in
no
way
whatever
replied
john
mangles
after
a
minute
investigation
of
the
documents
and
the
planisphere
no
chimed
in
all
the
rest
and
even
the
major
himself
it
can
not
apply
to
new
now
went
on
paganel
in
all
this
immense
space
between
this
large
island
and
the
american
coast
there
is
only
one
solitary
barren
little
island
crossed
by
the
and
what
is
its
name
asked
the
major
here
it
is
marked
in
the
map
it
is
maria
theresa
a
name
of
which
there
is
not
a
single
trace
in
either
of
the
three
not
the
slightest
said
glenarvan
i
leave
you
then
my
friends
to
decide
whether
all
these
probabilities
not
to
say
certainties
are
not
in
favor
of
the
australian
evidently
replied
the
captain
and
all
the
others
well
then
john
said
glenarvan
the
next
question
is
have
you
provisions
and
coal
enough
yes
your
honor
i
took
in
an
ample
store
at
talcahuano
and
besides
we
can
easily
replenish
our
stock
of
coal
at
cape
well
then
give
let
me
make
one
more
observation
interrupted
mcnabbs
go
on
whatever
likelihood
of
success
australia
may
offer
us
wouldn
t
it
be
advisable
to
stop
a
day
or
two
at
the
tristan
d
acunha
isles
and
the
amsterdam
they
lie
in
our
route
and
would
not
take
us
the
least
out
of
the
way
then
we
should
be
able
to
ascertain
if
the
britannia
had
left
any
traces
of
her
shipwreck
there
incredulous
major
exclaimed
paganel
he
still
sticks
to
his
i
stick
to
this
any
way
that
i
don
t
want
to
have
to
retrace
our
steps
supposing
that
australia
should
disappoint
our
sanguine
it
seems
to
me
a
good
precaution
replied
glenarvan
and
i
m
not
the
one
to
dissuade
you
from
it
returned
paganel
quite
the
steer
straight
for
tristan
d
immediately
your
honor
replied
the
captain
going
on
deck
while
robert
and
mary
grant
overwhelmed
lord
glenarvan
with
their
grateful
thanks
shortly
after
the
duncan
had
left
the
american
coast
and
was
running
eastward
her
sharp
keel
rapidly
cutting
her
way
through
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
ocean
chapter
ii
tristan
d
acunha
and
the
isle
of
amsterdam
if
the
yacht
had
followed
the
line
of
the
equator
the
degrees
which
separate
australia
from
america
or
more
correctly
cape
bernouilli
from
cape
corrientes
would
have
been
equal
to
geographical
miles
but
along
the
parallel
these
same
degrees
owing
to
the
form
of
the
earth
only
represent
miles
from
the
american
coast
to
tristan
d
acunha
is
reckoned
miles
a
distance
which
john
mangles
hoped
to
clear
in
ten
days
if
east
winds
did
not
retard
the
motion
of
the
yacht
but
he
was
not
long
uneasy
on
that
score
for
toward
evening
the
breeze
sensibly
lulled
and
then
changed
altogether
giving
the
duncan
a
fair
field
on
a
calm
sea
for
displaying
her
incomparable
qualities
as
a
sailor
the
passengers
had
fallen
back
into
their
ordinary
ship
life
and
it
hardly
seemed
as
if
they
really
could
have
been
absent
a
whole
month
instead
of
the
pacific
the
atlantic
stretched
itself
out
before
them
and
there
was
scarcely
a
shade
of
difference
in
the
waves
of
the
two
oceans
the
elements
after
having
handled
them
so
roughly
seemed
now
disposed
to
favor
them
to
the
utmost
the
sea
was
tranquil
and
the
wind
kept
in
the
right
quarter
so
that
the
yacht
could
spread
all
her
canvas
and
lend
its
aid
if
needed
to
the
indefatigable
steam
stored
up
in
the
boiler
under
such
conditions
the
voyage
was
safely
and
rapidly
accomplished
their
confidence
increased
as
they
found
themselves
nearer
the
australian
coast
they
began
to
talk
of
captain
grant
as
if
the
yacht
were
going
to
take
him
on
board
at
a
given
port
his
cabin
was
got
ready
and
berths
for
the
men
this
cabin
was
next
to
the
famous
which
paganel
had
taken
possession
of
instead
of
the
one
he
had
booked
on
the
scotia
it
had
been
till
now
occupied
by
olbinett
who
vacated
it
for
the
expected
guest
mary
took
great
delight
in
arranging
it
with
her
own
hands
and
adorning
it
for
the
reception
of
the
loved
inmate
the
learned
geographer
kept
himself
closely
shut
up
he
was
working
away
from
morning
till
night
at
a
work
entitled
sublime
impressions
of
a
geographer
in
the
argentine
pampas
and
they
could
hear
him
repeating
elegant
periods
aloud
before
committing
them
to
the
white
pages
of
his
and
more
than
once
unfaithful
to
clio
the
muse
of
history
he
invoked
in
his
transports
the
divine
calliope
the
muse
of
epic
poetry
paganel
made
no
secret
of
it
either
the
chaste
daughters
of
apollo
willingly
left
the
slopes
of
helicon
and
parnassus
at
his
call
lady
helena
paid
him
sincere
compliments
on
his
mythological
visitants
and
so
did
the
major
though
he
could
not
forbear
adding
but
mind
no
fits
of
absence
of
mind
my
dear
paganel
and
if
you
take
a
fancy
to
learn
australian
don
t
go
and
study
it
in
a
chinese
things
went
on
perfectly
smoothly
on
board
lady
helena
and
lord
glenarvan
found
leisure
to
watch
john
mangles
growing
attachment
to
mary
grant
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
against
it
and
indeed
since
john
remained
silent
it
was
best
to
take
no
notice
of
it
what
will
captain
grant
think
lord
glenarvan
asked
his
wife
one
day
he
ll
think
john
is
worthy
of
mary
my
dear
edward
and
he
ll
think
meanwhile
the
yacht
was
making
rapid
progress
five
days
after
losing
sight
of
cape
corrientes
on
the
of
november
they
fell
in
with
fine
westerly
breezes
and
the
duncan
might
almost
have
dispensed
with
her
screw
altogether
for
she
flew
over
the
water
like
a
bird
spreading
all
her
sails
to
catch
the
breeze
as
if
she
were
running
a
race
with
the
royal
thames
club
yachts
next
day
the
ocean
appeared
covered
with
immense
seaweeds
looking
like
a
great
pond
choked
up
with
the
debris
of
trees
and
plants
torn
off
the
neighboring
continents
commander
murray
had
specially
pointed
them
out
to
the
attention
of
navigators
the
duncan
appeared
to
glide
over
a
long
prairie
which
paganel
justly
compared
to
the
pampas
and
her
speed
slackened
a
little
hours
after
at
break
of
day
the
man
on
the
was
heard
calling
out
land
ahead
in
what
direction
asked
tom
austin
who
was
on
watch
leeward
was
the
reply
this
exciting
cry
brought
everyone
speedily
on
deck
soon
a
telescope
made
its
appearance
followed
by
jacques
paganel
the
learned
geographer
pointed
the
instrument
in
the
direction
indicated
but
could
see
nothing
that
resembled
land
look
in
the
clouds
said
john
mangles
ah
now
i
do
see
a
sort
of
peak
but
very
it
is
tristan
d
acunha
replied
john
mangles
then
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
we
must
be
eighty
miles
from
it
for
the
peak
of
tristan
seven
thousand
feet
high
is
visible
at
that
that
s
it
some
hours
later
the
sharp
lofty
crags
of
the
group
of
islands
stood
out
clearly
on
the
horizon
the
conical
peak
of
tristan
looked
black
against
the
bright
sky
which
seemed
all
ablaze
with
the
splendor
of
the
rising
sun
soon
the
principal
island
stood
out
from
the
rocky
mass
at
the
summit
of
a
triangle
inclining
toward
the
northeast
tristan
d
acunha
is
situated
in
degrees
of
southern
latitude
and
degrees
of
longitude
west
of
the
meridian
at
greenwich
inaccessible
island
is
eighteen
miles
to
the
southwest
and
nightingale
island
is
ten
miles
to
the
southeast
and
this
completes
the
little
solitary
group
of
islets
in
the
atlantic
ocean
toward
noon
the
two
principal
landmarks
by
which
the
group
is
recognized
were
sighted
and
at
the
duncan
entered
falmouth
bay
in
tristan
d
acunha
several
whaling
vessels
were
lying
quietly
at
anchor
there
for
the
coast
abounds
in
seals
and
other
marine
animals
john
mangle
s
first
care
was
to
find
good
anchorage
and
then
all
the
passengers
both
ladies
and
gentlemen
got
into
the
long
boat
and
were
rowed
ashore
they
stepped
out
on
a
beach
covered
with
fine
black
sand
the
impalpable
debris
of
the
calcined
rocks
of
the
island
tristan
d
acunha
is
the
capital
of
the
group
and
consists
of
a
little
village
lying
in
the
heart
of
the
bay
and
watered
by
a
noisy
rapid
stream
it
contained
about
fifty
houses
tolerably
clean
and
disposed
with
geometrical
regularity
behind
this
miniature
town
there
lay
hectares
of
meadow
land
bounded
by
an
embankment
of
lava
above
this
embankment
the
conical
peak
rose
feet
high
lord
glenarvan
was
received
by
a
governor
supplied
from
the
english
colony
at
the
cape
he
inquired
at
once
respecting
harry
grant
and
the
britannia
and
found
the
names
entirely
unknown
the
tristan
d
acunha
isles
are
out
of
the
route
of
ships
and
consequently
little
frequented
since
the
wreck
of
the
in
on
the
rocks
of
inaccessible
island
two
vessels
have
stranded
on
the
chief
island
the
primanguet
in
and
the
american
philadelphia
in
these
three
events
comprise
the
whole
catalogue
of
maritime
disasters
in
the
annals
of
the
acunhas
lord
glenarvan
did
not
expect
to
glean
any
information
and
only
asked
by
the
way
of
duty
he
even
sent
the
boats
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
island
the
entire
extent
of
which
was
not
more
than
seventeen
miles
at
most
in
the
interim
the
passengers
walked
about
the
village
the
population
does
not
exceed
inhabitants
and
consists
of
english
and
americans

to

and
cape
hottentots
who
might
bear
away
the
palm
for
ugliness
the
children
of
these
heterogeneous
households
are
very
disagreeable
compounds
of
saxon
stiffness
and
african
blackness
it
was
nearly
nightfall
before
the
party
returned
to
the
yacht
chattering
and
admiring
the
natural
riches
displayed
on
all
sides
for
even
close
to
the
streets
of
the
capital
fields
of
wheat
and
maize
were
waving
and
crops
of
vegetables
imported
forty
years
before
and
in
the
environs
of
the
village
herds
of
cattle
and
sheep
were
feeding
the
boats
returned
to
the
duncan
about
the
same
time
as
lord
glenarvan
they
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
entire
island
in
a
few
hours
but
without
coming
across
the
least
trace
of
the
britannia
the
only
result
of
this
voyage
of
circumnavigation
was
to
strike
out
the
name
of
isle
tristan
from
the
program
of
search
chapter
iii
cape
town
and
viot
as
john
mangles
intended
to
put
in
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
for
coals
he
was
obliged
to
deviate
a
little
from
the
parallel
and
go
two
degrees
north
in
less
than
six
days
he
cleared
the
thirteen
hundred
miles
which
separate
the
point
of
africa
from
tristan
d
acunha
and
on
the
of
november
at
the
table
mountain
was
sighted
at
eight
o
clock
they
entered
the
bay
and
cast
anchor
in
the
port
of
cape
town
they
sailed
away
next
morning
at
daybreak
between
the
cape
and
amsterdam
island
there
is
a
distance
of
miles
but
with
a
good
sea
and
favoring
breeze
this
was
only
a
ten
day
s
voyage
the
elements
were
now
no
longer
at
war
with
the
travelers
as
on
their
journey
across
the
pampas
air
and
water
seemed
in
league
to
help
them
forward
ah
the
sea
the
sea
exclaimed
paganel
it
is
the
field
for
the
exercise
of
human
energies
and
the
ship
is
the
true
vehicle
of
civilization
think
my
friends
if
the
globe
had
been
only
an
immense
continent
the
thousandth
part
of
it
would
still
be
unknown
to
us
even
in
this
nineteenth
century
see
how
it
is
in
the
interior
of
great
countries
in
the
steppes
of
siberia
in
the
plains
of
central
asia
in
the
deserts
of
africa
in
the
prairies
of
america
in
the
immense
wilds
of
australia
in
the
icy
solitudes
of
the
poles
man
scarcely
dares
to
venture
the
most
daring
shrinks
back
the
most
courageous
succumbs
they
can
not
penetrate
them
the
means
of
transport
are
insufficient
and
the
heat
and
disease
and
savage
disposition
of
the
natives
are
impassable
obstacles
twenty
miles
of
desert
separate
men
more
than
five
hundred
miles
of
paganel
spoke
with
such
warmth
that
even
the
major
had
nothing
to
say
against
this
panegyric
of
the
ocean
indeed
if
the
finding
of
harry
grant
had
involved
following
a
parallel
across
continents
instead
of
oceans
the
enterprise
could
not
have
been
attempted
but
the
sea
was
there
ready
to
carry
the
travelers
from
one
country
to
another
and
on
the
of
december
at
the
first
streak
of
day
they
saw
a
fresh
mountain
apparently
emerging
from
the
bosom
of
the
waves
this
was
amsterdam
island
situated
in
degrees
minutes
latitude
and
degrees
minutes
longitude
the
high
cone
of
which
in
clear
weather
is
visible
fifty
miles
off
at
eight
o
clock
its
form
indistinct
though
it
still
was
seemed
almost
a
reproduction
of
teneriffe
and
consequently
it
must
resemble
tristan
d
acunha
observed
glenarvan
a
very
wise
conclusion
said
paganel
according
to
the
geometrographic
axiom
that
two
islands
resembling
a
third
must
have
a
common
likeness
i
will
only
add
that
like
tristan
d
acunha
amsterdam
island
is
equally
rich
in
seals
and
there
are
robinsons
everywhere
then
said
lady
helena
indeed
madam
replied
paganel
i
know
few
islands
without
some
tale
of
the
kind
appertaining
to
them
and
the
romance
of
your
immortal
countryman
daniel
defoe
has
been
often
enough
realized
before
his
monsieur
paganel
said
mary
may
i
ask
you
a
question
two
if
you
like
my
dear
young
lady
and
i
promise
to
answer
well
then
i
want
to
know
if
you
would
be
very
much
frightened
at
the
idea
of
being
cast
away
alone
on
a
desert
i
exclaimed
paganel
come
now
my
good
fellow
said
the
major
don
t
go
and
tell
us
that
it
is
your
most
cherished
i
don
t
pretend
it
is
that
but
still
after
all
such
an
adventure
would
not
be
very
unpleasant
to
me
i
should
begin
a
new
life
i
should
hunt
and
fish
i
should
choose
a
grotto
for
my
domicile
in
winter
and
a
tree
in
summer
i
should
make
storehouses
for
my
harvests
in
one
word
i
should
colonize
my
all
by
yourself
all
by
myself
if
i
was
obliged
besides
are
we
ever
obliged
can
not
one
find
friends
among
the
animals
and
choose
some
tame
kid
or
eloquent
parrot
or
amiable
monkey
and
if
a
lucky
chance
should
send
one
a
companion
like
the
faithful
friday
what
more
is
needed
two
friends
on
a
rock
there
is
happiness
suppose
now
the
major
and
i
thank
you
replied
the
major
interrupting
him
i
have
no
inclination
in
that
line
and
should
make
a
very
poor
robinson
my
dear
monsieur
paganel
said
lady
helena
you
are
letting
your
imagination
run
away
with
you
as
usual
but
the
dream
is
very
different
from
the
reality
you
are
thinking
of
an
imaginary
robinson
s
life
thrown
on
a
picked
island
and
treated
like
a
spoiled
child
by
nature
you
only
see
the
sunny
what
madam
you
don
t
believe
a
man
could
be
happy
on
a
desert
island
i
do
not
man
is
made
for
society
and
not
for
solitude
and
solitude
can
only
engender
despair
it
is
a
question
of
time
at
the
outset
it
is
quite
possible
that
material
wants
and
the
very
necessities
of
existence
may
engross
the
poor
shipwrecked
fellow
just
snatched
from
the
waves
but
afterward
when
he
feels
himself
alone
far
from
his
fellow
men
without
any
hope
of
seeing
country
and
friends
again
what
must
he
think
what
must
he
suffer
his
little
island
is
all
his
world
the
whole
human
race
is
shut
up
in
himself
and
when
death
comes
which
utter
loneliness
will
make
terrible
he
will
be
like
the
last
man
on
the
last
day
of
the
world
believe
me
monsieur
paganel
such
a
man
is
not
to
be
paganel
gave
in
though
regretfully
to
the
arguments
of
lady
helena
and
still
kept
up
a
discussion
on
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
isolation
till
the
very
moment
the
duncan
dropped
anchor
about
a
mile
off
amsterdam
island
this
lonely
group
in
the
indian
ocean
consists
of
two
distinct
islands
miles
apart
and
situated
exactly
on
the
meridian
of
the
indian
peninsula
to
the
north
is
amsterdam
island
and
to
the
south
paul
but
they
have
been
often
confounded
by
geographers
and
navigators
at
the
time
of
the
duncan
s
visit
to
the
island
the
population
consisted
of
three
people
a
frenchman
and
two
mulattoes
all
three
employed
by
the
merchant
proprietor
paganel
was
delighted
to
shake
hands
with
a
countryman
in
the
person
of
good
old
monsieur
viot
he
was
far
advanced
in
years
but
did
the
honors
of
the
place
with
much
politeness
it
was
a
happy
day
for
him
when
these
kindly
strangers
touched
at
his
island
for
peter
s
was
only
frequented
by
and
now
and
then
a
whaler
the
crews
of
which
are
usually
rough
coarse
men
viot
presented
his
subjects
the
two
mulattoes
they
composed
the
whole
living
population
of
the
island
except
a
few
wild
boars
in
the
interior
and
myriads
of
penguins
the
little
house
where
the
three
solitary
men
lived
was
in
the
heart
of
a
natural
bay
on
the
southeast
formed
by
the
crumbling
away
of
a
portion
of
the
mountain
twice
over
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
amsterdam
island
became
the
country
of
deserted
sailors
providentially
saved
from
misery
and
death
but
since
these
events
no
vessel
had
been
lost
on
its
coast
had
any
shipwreck
occurred
some
fragments
must
have
been
thrown
on
the
sandy
shore
and
any
poor
sufferers
from
it
would
have
found
their
way
to
viot
s
the
old
man
had
been
long
on
the
island
and
had
never
been
called
upon
to
exercise
such
hospitality
of
the
britannia
and
captain
grant
he
knew
nothing
but
he
was
certain
that
the
disaster
had
not
happened
on
amsterdam
island
nor
on
the
islet
called
paul
for
whalers
and
went
there
constantly
and
must
have
heard
of
it
glenarvan
was
neither
surprised
nor
vexed
at
the
reply
indeed
his
object
in
asking
was
rather
to
establish
the
fact
that
captain
grant
had
not
been
there
than
that
he
had
this
done
they
were
ready
to
proceed
on
their
voyage
next
day
they
rambled
about
the
island
till
evening
as
its
appearance
was
very
inviting
its
fauna
and
flora
however
were
poor
in
the
extreme
the
only
specimens
of
quadrupeds
birds
fish
and
cetacea
were
a
few
wild
boars
stormy
petrels
albatrosses
perch
and
seals
here
and
there
thermal
springs
and
chalybeate
waters
escaped
from
the
black
lava
and
thin
dark
vapors
rose
above
the
volcanic
soil
some
of
these
springs
were
very
hot
john
mangles
held
his
thermometer
in
one
of
them
and
found
the
temperature
was
degrees
fahrenheit
fish
caught
in
the
sea
a
few
yards
off
cooked
in
five
minutes
in
these
all
but
boiling
waters
a
fact
which
made
paganel
resolve
not
to
attempt
to
bathe
in
them
toward
evening
after
a
long
promenade
glenarvan
and
his
party
bade
adieu
to
the
good
old
viot
and
returned
to
the
yacht
wishing
him
all
the
happiness
possible
on
his
desert
island
and
receiving
in
return
the
old
man
s
blessing
on
their
expedition
chapter
iv
a
wager
and
how
decided
on
the
of
december
at
three
the
duncan
lay
puffing
out
her
smoke
in
the
little
harbor
ready
to
start
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
anchor
was
lifted
and
the
screw
set
in
motion
by
eight
o
clock
when
the
passengers
came
on
deck
the
amsterdam
island
had
almost
disappeared
from
view
behind
the
mists
of
the
horizon
this
was
the
last
on
the
route
and
nothing
now
was
between
them
and
the
australian
coast
but
three
thousand
miles
distance
should
the
west
wind
continue
but
a
dozen
days
longer
and
the
sea
remain
favorable
the
yacht
would
have
reached
the
end
of
her
voyage
mary
grant
and
her
brother
could
not
gaze
without
emotion
at
the
waves
through
which
the
duncan
was
speeding
her
course
when
they
thought
that
these
very
same
waves
must
have
dashed
against
the
prow
of
the
britannia
but
a
few
days
before
her
shipwreck
here
perhaps
captain
grant
with
a
disabled
ship
and
diminished
crew
had
struggled
against
the
tremendous
hurricanes
of
the
indian
ocean
and
felt
himself
driven
toward
the
coast
with
irresistible
force
the
captain
pointed
out
to
mary
the
different
currents
on
the
ship
s
chart
and
explained
to
her
their
constant
direction
among
others
there
was
one
running
straight
to
the
australian
continent
and
its
action
is
equally
felt
in
the
atlantic
and
pacific
it
was
doubtless
against
this
that
the
britannia
dismasted
and
rudderless
had
been
unable
to
contend
and
consequently
been
dashed
against
the
coast
and
broken
in
pieces
a
difficulty
about
this
however
presented
itself
the
last
intelligence
of
captain
grant
was
from
callao
on
the
of
may
as
appeared
in
the
and
shipping
how
then
was
it
possible
that
on
the
of
june
only
eight
days
after
leaving
the
shores
of
peru
that
the
britannia
could
have
found
herself
in
the
indian
ocean
but
to
this
paganel
who
was
consulted
on
the
subject
found
a
very
plausible
solution
it
was
one
evening
about
six
days
after
their
leaving
amsterdam
island
when
they
were
all
chatting
together
on
the
poop
that
the
difficulty
was
stated
by
glenarvan
paganel
made
no
reply
but
went
and
fetched
the
document
after
perusing
it
he
still
remained
silent
simply
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
if
ashamed
of
troubling
himself
about
such
a
trifle
come
my
good
friend
said
glenarvan
at
least
give
us
an
no
replied
paganel
i
ll
merely
ask
a
question
for
captain
john
to
and
what
is
it
monsieur
paganel
said
john
mangles
could
a
quick
ship
make
the
distance
in
a
month
over
that
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
which
lies
between
america
and
australia
yes
by
making
two
hundred
miles
in
would
that
be
an
extraordinary
rate
of
speed
not
at
all
sailing
clippers
often
go
well
then
instead
of
june
on
this
document
suppose
that
one
figure
has
been
destroyed
by
the
and
read
june
or
june
and
all
is
that
s
to
say
replied
lady
helena
that
between
the
of
may
and
the
of
june
captain
grant
could
have
crossed
the
pacific
and
found
himself
in
the
indian
paganel
s
theory
met
with
universal
acceptance
that
s
one
more
point
cleared
up
said
glenarvan
thanks
to
our
friend
all
that
remains
to
be
done
now
is
to
get
to
australia
and
look
out
for
traces
of
the
wreck
on
the
western
or
the
eastern
said
john
mangles
indeed
john
you
may
be
right
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
document
to
indicate
which
shore
was
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
and
both
points
of
the
continent
crossed
by
the
parallel
must
therefore
be
then
my
lord
it
is
doubtful
after
all
said
mary
oh
no
miss
mary
john
mangles
hastened
to
reply
seeing
the
young
girl
s
apprehension
his
lordship
will
please
to
consider
that
if
captain
grant
had
gained
the
shore
on
the
east
of
australia
he
would
almost
immediately
have
found
refuge
and
assistance
the
whole
of
that
coast
is
english
we
might
say
peopled
with
colonists
the
crew
of
the
britannia
could
not
have
gone
ten
miles
without
meeting
a
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
captain
john
said
paganel
on
the
eastern
coast
harry
grant
would
not
only
have
found
an
english
colony
easily
but
he
would
certainly
have
met
with
some
means
of
transport
back
to
and
he
would
not
have
found
the
same
resources
on
the
side
we
are
making
for
asked
lady
helena
no
madam
replied
paganel
it
is
a
desert
coast
with
no
communication
between
it
and
melbourne
or
adelaide
if
the
britannia
was
wrecked
on
those
rocky
shores
she
was
as
much
cut
off
from
all
chance
of
help
as
if
she
had
been
lost
on
the
inhospitable
shores
of
but
what
has
become
of
my
father
there
then
all
these
two
years
asked
mary
grant
my
dear
mary
replied
paganel
you
have
not
the
least
doubt
have
you
that
captain
grant
reached
the
australian
continent
after
his
shipwreck
no
monsieur
well
granting
that
what
became
of
him
the
suppositions
we
might
make
are
not
numerous
they
are
confined
to
three
either
harry
grant
and
his
companions
have
found
their
way
to
the
english
colonies
or
they
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
natives
or
they
are
lost
in
the
immense
wilds
of
go
on
paganel
said
lord
glenarvan
as
the
learned
frenchman
made
a
pause
the
first
hypothesis
i
reject
then
to
begin
with
for
harry
grant
could
not
have
reached
the
english
colonies
or
long
ago
he
would
have
been
back
with
his
children
in
the
good
town
of
poor
father
murmured
mary
away
from
us
for
two
whole
hush
mary
said
robert
monsieur
paganel
will
tell
alas
my
boy
i
can
not
all
that
i
affirm
is
that
captain
grant
is
in
the
hands
of
the
but
these
natives
said
lady
helena
hastily
are
they
reassure
yourself
madam
said
paganel
divining
her
thoughts
the
aborigines
of
australia
are
low
enough
in
the
scale
of
human
intelligence
and
most
degraded
and
uncivilized
but
they
are
mild
and
gentle
in
disposition
and
not
sanguinary
like
their
new
zealand
neighbors
though
they
may
be
prisoners
their
lives
have
never
been
threatened
you
may
be
sure
all
travelers
are
unanimous
in
declaring
that
the
australian
natives
abhor
shedding
blood
and
many
a
time
they
have
found
in
them
faithful
allies
in
repelling
the
attacks
of
convicts
far
more
cruelly
you
hear
what
monsieur
paganel
tells
us
mary
said
lady
helena
turning
to
the
young
girl
if
your
father
is
in
the
hands
of
the
natives
which
seems
probable
from
the
document
we
shall
find
and
what
if
he
is
lost
in
that
immense
country
asked
mary
well
we
ll
find
him
still
exclaimed
paganel
in
a
confident
tone
won
t
we
friends
most
certainly
replied
glenarvan
and
anxious
to
give
a
less
gloomy
turn
to
the
conversation
he
added
but
i
won
t
admit
the
supposition
of
his
being
lost
not
for
an
neither
will
i
said
paganel
is
australia
a
big
place
inquired
robert
australia
my
boy
is
about
as
large
as
of
europe
it
has
somewhere
about
so
much
as
that
said
the
major
yes
mcnabbs
almost
to
a
yard
s
breadth
don
t
you
think
now
it
has
a
right
to
be
called
a
continent
i
do
i
may
add
continued
the
savant
that
there
are
but
few
accounts
of
travelers
being
lost
in
this
immense
country
indeed
i
believe
leichardt
is
the
only
one
of
whose
fate
we
are
ignorant
and
some
time
before
my
departure
i
learned
from
the
geographical
society
that
mcintyre
had
strong
hopes
of
having
discovered
traces
of
the
whole
of
australia
then
is
not
yet
explored
asked
lady
helena
no
madam
but
very
little
of
it
this
continent
is
not
much
better
known
than
the
interior
of
africa
and
yet
it
is
from
no
lack
of
enterprising
travelers
from
to
more
than
fifty
have
been
engaged
in
exploring
along
the
coast
and
in
the
oh
fifty
exclaimed
mcnabbs
incredulously
no
no
objected
the
major
that
is
going
too
and
i
might
go
farther
mcnabbs
replied
the
geographer
impatient
of
contradiction
yes
mcnabbs
quite
that
farther
still
if
you
doubt
me
i
can
give
you
the
oh
oh
said
the
major
coolly
that
s
just
like
you
savants
you
stick
at
major
will
you
bet
your
rifle
against
my
telescope
why
not
paganel
if
it
would
give
you
any
done
major
exclaimed
paganel
you
may
say
to
your
rifle
for
it
will
never
shoot
another
chamois
or
fox
unless
i
lend
it
to
you
which
i
shall
always
be
happy
to
do
by
the
and
whenever
you
require
the
use
of
your
telescope
paganel
i
shall
be
equally
obliging
replied
the
major
gravely
let
us
begin
then
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
shall
be
our
jury
robert
you
must
keep
this
was
agreed
upon
and
paganel
forthwith
commenced
mnemosyne
goddess
of
memory
chaste
mother
of
the
muses
he
exclaimed
inspire
thy
faithful
servant
and
fervent
worshiper
two
hundred
and
years
ago
my
friends
australia
was
unknown
strong
suspicions
were
entertained
of
the
existence
of
a
great
southern
continent
in
the
library
of
your
british
museum
glenarvan
there
are
two
charts
the
date
of
which
is
which
mention
a
country
south
of
asia
called
by
the
portuguese
great
java
but
these
charts
are
not
sufficiently
authentic
in
the
seventeenth
century
in
quiros
a
spanish
navigator
discovered
a
country
which
he
named
australia
de
espiritu
santo
some
authors
imagine
that
this
was
the
new
hebrides
group
and
not
australia
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
the
question
however
count
quiros
robert
and
let
us
pass
on
to
one
said
robert
in
that
same
year
louis
vas
de
torres
the
second
in
command
of
the
fleet
of
quiros
pushed
further
south
but
it
is
to
theodore
hertoge
a
dutchman
that
the
honor
of
the
great
discovery
belongs
he
touched
the
western
coast
of
australia
in
degrees
latitude
and
called
it
eendracht
after
his
vessel
from
this
time
navigators
increased
in
zeachen
discovered
the
northern
parts
of
the
coast
and
called
them
arnheim
and
diemen
in
jan
edels
went
along
the
western
coast
and
christened
it
by
his
own
name
in
leuwin
went
down
as
far
as
the
cape
which
became
his
and
so
paganel
continued
with
name
after
name
until
his
hearers
cried
for
mercy
stop
paganel
said
glenarvan
laughing
heartily
don
t
quite
crush
poor
mcnabbs
be
generous
he
owns
he
is
and
what
about
the
rifle
asked
the
geographer
triumphantly
it
is
yours
paganel
replied
the
major
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
but
your
memory
might
gain
an
armory
by
such
it
is
certainly
impossible
to
be
better
acquainted
with
australia
not
the
least
name
not
even
the
most
trifling
fact
as
to
the
most
trifling
fact
i
don
t
know
about
that
said
the
major
shaking
his
head
what
do
you
mean
mcnabbs
exclaimed
paganel
simply
that
perhaps
all
the
incidents
connected
with
the
discovery
of
australia
may
not
be
known
to
just
fancy
retorted
paganel
throwing
back
his
head
proudly
come
now
if
i
name
one
fact
you
don
t
know
will
you
give
me
back
my
rifle
said
mcnabbs
on
the
spot
very
well
it
s
a
bargain
yes
a
bargain
that
s
all
right
well
now
paganel
do
you
know
how
it
is
that
australia
does
not
belong
to
france
but
it
seems
to
me
or
at
any
rate
do
you
know
what
s
the
reason
the
english
give
asked
the
major
no
replied
paganel
with
an
air
of
vexation
just
because
captain
baudin
who
was
by
no
means
a
timid
man
was
so
afraid
in
of
the
croaking
of
the
australian
frogs
that
he
raised
his
anchor
with
all
possible
speed
and
quitted
the
coast
never
to
what
exclaimed
paganel
do
they
actually
give
that
version
of
it
in
england
but
it
is
just
a
bad
bad
enough
certainly
but
still
it
is
history
in
the
united
it
s
an
insult
exclaimed
the
patriotic
geographer
and
they
relate
that
gravely
i
must
own
it
is
the
case
replied
glenarvan
amidst
a
general
outburst
of
laughter
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
never
heard
of
it
before
never
but
i
protest
against
it
besides
the
english
call
us
now
in
general
people
are
not
afraid
of
what
they
it
is
said
though
for
all
that
replied
mcnabbs
so
the
major
kept
his
famous
rifle
after
all
chapter
v
the
storm
on
the
indian
ocean
two
days
after
this
conversation
john
mangles
announced
that
the
duncan
was
in
longitude
degrees
minutes
and
the
passengers
found
on
consulting
the
chart
that
consequently
cape
bernouilli
could
not
be
more
than
five
degrees
off
they
must
be
sailing
then
in
that
part
of
the
indian
ocean
which
washed
the
australian
continent
and
in
four
days
might
hope
to
see
cape
bernouilli
appear
on
the
horizon
hitherto
the
yacht
had
been
favored
by
a
strong
westerly
breeze
but
now
there
were
evident
signs
that
a
calm
was
impending
and
on
the
of
december
the
wind
fell
entirely
as
the
sailors
say
there
was
not
enough
to
fill
a
cap
there
was
no
saying
how
long
this
state
of
the
atmosphere
might
last
but
for
the
powerful
propeller
the
yacht
would
have
been
obliged
to
lie
motionless
as
a
log
the
young
captain
was
very
much
annoyed
however
at
the
prospect
of
emptying
his
for
he
had
covered
his
ship
with
canvas
intending
to
take
advantage
of
the
slightest
breeze
after
all
though
said
glenarvan
with
whom
he
was
talking
over
the
subject
it
is
better
to
have
no
wind
than
a
contrary
your
lordship
is
right
replied
john
mangles
but
the
fact
is
these
sudden
calms
bring
change
of
weather
and
this
is
why
i
dread
them
we
are
close
on
the
trade
winds
and
if
we
get
them
ever
so
little
in
our
teeth
it
will
delay
us
well
john
what
if
it
does
it
will
only
make
our
voyage
a
little
yes
if
it
does
not
bring
a
storm
with
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
we
are
going
to
have
bad
weather
replied
glenarvan
examining
the
sky
which
from
horizon
to
zenith
seemed
absolutely
cloudless
i
do
returned
the
captain
i
may
say
so
to
your
lordship
but
i
should
not
like
to
alarm
lady
glenarvan
or
miss
you
are
acting
wisely
but
what
makes
you
uneasy
sure
indications
of
a
storm
don
t
trust
my
lord
to
the
appearance
of
the
sky
nothing
is
more
deceitful
for
the
last
two
days
the
barometer
has
been
falling
in
a
most
ominous
manner
and
is
now
at
degrees
this
is
a
warning
i
dare
not
neglect
for
there
is
nothing
i
dread
more
than
storms
in
the
southern
seas
i
have
had
a
taste
of
them
already
the
vapors
which
become
condensed
in
the
immense
glaciers
at
the
south
pole
produce
a
current
of
air
of
extreme
violence
this
causes
a
struggle
between
the
polar
and
equatorial
winds
which
results
in
cyclones
tornadoes
and
all
those
multiplied
varieties
of
tempest
against
which
a
ship
is
no
well
john
said
glenarvan
the
duncan
is
a
good
ship
and
her
captain
is
a
brave
sailor
let
the
storm
come
we
ll
meet
it
john
mangles
remained
on
deck
the
whole
night
for
though
as
yet
the
sky
was
still
unclouded
he
had
such
faith
in
his
that
he
took
every
precaution
that
prudence
could
suggest
about
the
sky
began
to
darken
in
the
south
and
the
crew
were
called
up
and
all
the
sails
hauled
in
except
the
foresail
brigantine
and
at
midnight
the
wind
freshened
and
before
long
the
cracking
of
the
masts
and
the
rattling
of
the
cordage
and
groaning
of
the
timbers
awakened
the
passengers
who
speedily
made
their
appearance
on
deck
at
least
paganel
glenarvan
the
major
and
robert
is
it
the
hurricane
asked
glenarvan
quietly
not
yet
replied
the
captain
but
it
is
close
at
and
he
went
on
giving
his
orders
to
the
men
and
doing
his
best
to
make
ready
for
the
storm
standing
like
an
officer
commanding
a
breach
with
his
face
to
the
wind
and
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
troubled
sky
the
glass
had
fallen
to
degrees
and
the
hand
pointed
to
tempest
it
was
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
lady
helena
and
miss
grant
ventured
upstairs
on
deck
but
they
no
sooner
made
their
appearance
than
the
captain
hurried
toward
them
and
begged
them
to
go
below
again
immediately
the
waves
were
already
beginning
to
dash
over
the
side
of
the
ship
and
the
sea
might
any
moment
sweep
right
over
her
from
stem
to
stern
the
noise
of
the
warring
elements
was
so
great
that
his
words
were
scarcely
audible
but
lady
helena
took
advantage
of
a
sudden
lull
to
ask
if
there
was
any
danger
none
whatever
replied
john
mangles
but
you
can
not
remain
on
deck
madam
no
more
can
miss
the
ladies
could
not
disobey
an
order
that
seemed
almost
an
entreaty
and
they
returned
to
their
cabin
at
the
same
moment
the
wind
redoubled
its
fury
making
the
masts
bend
beneath
the
weight
of
the
sails
and
completely
lifting
up
the
yacht
haul
up
the
foresail
shouted
the
captain
lower
the
topsail
and
glenarvan
and
his
companions
stood
silently
gazing
at
the
struggle
between
their
good
ship
and
the
waves
lost
in
wondering
and
admiration
at
the
spectacle
just
then
a
dull
hissing
was
heard
above
the
noise
of
the
elements
the
steam
was
escaping
violently
not
by
the
funnel
but
from
the
of
the
boiler
the
alarm
whistle
sounded
unnaturally
loud
and
the
yacht
made
a
frightful
pitch
overturning
wilson
who
was
at
the
wheel
by
an
unexpected
blow
from
the
tiller
the
duncan
no
longer
obeyed
the
helm
what
is
the
matter
cried
the
captain
rushing
on
the
bridge
the
ship
is
heeling
over
on
her
side
replied
wilson
the
engine
the
engine
shouted
the
engineer
away
rushed
john
to
the
a
cloud
of
steam
filled
the
room
the
pistons
were
motionless
in
their
cylinders
and
they
were
apparently
powerless
and
the
fearing
for
his
boilers
was
letting
off
the
steam
what
s
wrong
asked
the
captain
the
propeller
is
bent
or
entangled
was
the
reply
it
s
not
acting
at
can
t
you
extricate
it
it
is
an
accident
like
this
could
not
be
remedied
and
john
s
only
resource
was
to
fall
back
on
his
sails
and
seek
to
make
an
auxiliary
of
his
most
powerful
enemy
the
wind
he
went
up
again
on
deck
and
after
explaining
in
a
few
words
to
lord
glenarvan
how
things
stood
begged
him
to
retire
to
his
cabin
with
the
rest
of
the
passengers
but
glenarvan
wished
to
remain
above
no
your
lordship
said
the
captain
in
a
firm
tone
i
must
be
alone
with
my
men
go
into
the
saloon
the
vessel
will
have
a
hard
fight
with
the
waves
and
they
would
sweep
you
over
without
but
we
might
be
a
go
in
my
lord
go
in
i
must
indeed
insist
on
it
there
are
times
when
i
must
be
master
on
board
and
retire
you
their
situation
must
indeed
be
desperate
for
john
mangles
to
speak
in
such
authoritative
language
glenarvan
was
wise
enough
to
understand
this
and
felt
he
must
set
an
example
in
obedience
he
therefore
quitted
the
deck
immediately
with
his
three
companions
and
rejoined
the
ladies
who
were
anxiously
watching
the
denouement
of
this
war
with
the
elements
he
s
an
energetic
fellow
this
brave
john
of
mine
said
lord
glenarvan
as
he
entered
the
saloon
that
he
is
replied
paganel
he
reminds
me
of
your
great
shakespeare
s
boatswain
in
the
tempest
who
says
to
the
king
on
board
hence
what
care
these
roarers
for
the
name
of
king
to
cabin
silence
trouble
us
however
john
mangles
did
not
lose
a
second
in
extricating
his
ship
from
the
peril
in
which
she
was
placed
by
the
condition
of
her
screw
propeller
he
resolved
to
rely
on
the
mainsail
for
keeping
in
the
right
route
as
far
as
possible
and
to
brace
the
yards
obliquely
so
as
not
to
present
a
direct
front
to
the
storm
the
yacht
turned
about
like
a
swift
horse
that
feels
the
spur
and
presented
a
broadside
to
the
billows
the
only
question
was
how
long
would
she
hold
out
with
so
little
sail
and
what
sail
could
resist
such
violence
for
any
length
of
time
the
great
advantage
of
keeping
up
the
mainsail
was
that
it
presented
to
the
waves
only
the
most
solid
portions
of
the
yacht
and
kept
her
in
the
right
course
still
it
involved
some
peril
for
the
vessel
might
get
engulfed
between
the
waves
and
not
be
able
to
raise
herself
but
mangles
felt
there
was
no
alternative
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
keep
the
crew
ready
to
alter
the
sail
at
any
moment
and
stay
in
the
shrouds
himself
watching
the
tempest
the
remainder
of
the
night
was
spent
in
this
manner
and
it
was
hoped
that
morning
would
bring
a
calm
but
this
was
a
delusive
hope
at
the
wind
had
increased
to
a
hurricane
john
said
nothing
but
he
trembled
for
his
ship
and
those
on
board
the
duncan
made
a
frightful
plunge
forward
and
for
an
instant
the
men
thought
she
would
never
rise
again
already
they
had
seized
their
hatchets
to
cut
away
the
shrouds
from
the
mainmast
but
the
next
minute
the
sails
were
torn
away
by
the
tempest
and
had
flown
off
like
gigantic
albatrosses
the
yacht
had
risen
once
more
but
she
found
herself
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
entirely
now
with
nothing
to
steady
or
direct
her
and
was
so
fearfully
pitched
and
tossed
about
that
every
moment
the
captain
expected
the
masts
would
break
short
off
john
had
no
resource
but
to
put
up
a
forestaysail
and
run
before
the
gale
but
this
was
no
easy
task
twenty
times
over
he
had
all
his
work
to
begin
again
and
it
was
before
his
attempt
succeeded
a
mere
shred
of
canvas
though
it
was
it
was
enough
to
drive
the
duncan
forward
with
inconceivable
rapidity
to
the
northeast
of
course
in
the
same
direction
as
the
hurricane
swiftness
was
their
only
chance
of
safety
sometimes
she
would
get
in
advance
of
the
waves
which
carried
her
along
and
cutting
through
them
with
her
sharp
prow
bury
herself
in
their
depths
at
others
she
would
keep
pace
with
them
and
make
such
enormous
leaps
that
there
was
imminent
danger
of
her
being
pitched
over
on
her
side
and
then
again
every
now
and
then
the
sea
would
the
yacht
and
the
angry
billows
would
sweep
over
the
deck
from
stem
to
stern
with
tremendous
violence
in
this
alarming
situation
and
amid
dreadful
alternations
of
hope
and
despair
the
of
december
passed
away
and
the
ensuing
night
john
mangles
never
left
his
post
not
even
to
take
food
though
his
impassive
face
betrayed
no
symptoms
of
fear
he
was
tortured
with
anxiety
and
his
steady
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
north
as
if
trying
to
pierce
through
the
thick
mists
that
enshrouded
it
there
was
indeed
great
cause
for
fear
the
duncan
was
out
of
her
course
and
rushing
toward
the
australian
coast
with
a
speed
which
nothing
could
lessen
to
john
mangles
it
seemed
as
if
a
thunderbolt
were
driving
them
along
every
instant
he
expected
the
yacht
would
dash
against
some
rock
for
he
reckoned
the
coast
could
not
be
more
than
twelve
miles
off
and
better
far
be
in
mid
ocean
exposed
to
all
its
fury
than
too
near
land
john
mangles
went
to
find
glenarvan
and
had
a
private
talk
with
him
about
their
situation
telling
him
frankly
the
true
state
of
affairs
stating
the
case
with
all
the
coolness
of
a
sailor
prepared
for
anything
and
everything
and
he
wound
up
by
saying
he
might
perhaps
be
obliged
to
cast
the
yacht
on
shore
to
save
the
lives
of
those
on
board
my
lord
he
added
do
it
then
john
replied
lord
glenarvan
and
lady
helena
miss
grant
i
will
tell
them
at
the
last
moment
when
all
hope
of
keeping
out
at
sea
is
over
you
will
let
me
know
i
will
my
glenarvan
rejoined
his
companions
who
felt
they
were
in
imminent
danger
though
no
word
was
spoken
on
the
subject
both
ladies
displayed
great
courage
fully
equal
to
any
of
the
party
paganel
descanted
in
the
most
inopportune
manner
about
the
direction
of
atmospheric
currents
making
interesting
comparisons
between
tornadoes
cyclones
and
rectilinear
tempests
the
major
calmly
awaited
the
end
with
the
fatalism
of
a
mussulman
about
eleven
o
clock
the
hurricane
appeared
to
decrease
slightly
the
damp
mist
began
to
clear
away
and
a
sudden
gleam
of
light
revealed
a
shore
about
six
miles
distant
they
were
driving
right
down
on
it
enormous
breakers
fifty
feet
high
were
dashing
over
it
and
the
fact
of
their
height
showed
john
there
must
be
solid
ground
before
they
could
make
such
a
rebound
those
are
he
said
to
austin
i
think
they
are
replied
the
mate
we
are
in
god
s
hands
said
john
if
we
can
not
find
any
opening
for
the
yacht
and
if
she
doesn
t
find
the
way
in
herself
we
are
the
tide
is
high
at
present
it
is
just
possible
we
may
ride
over
those
but
just
see
those
breakers
what
ship
could
stand
them
let
us
invoke
divine
aid
austin
meanwhile
the
duncan
was
speeding
on
at
a
frightful
rate
soon
she
was
within
two
miles
of
the
which
were
still
veiled
from
time
to
time
in
thick
mist
but
john
fancied
he
could
see
beyond
the
breakers
a
quiet
basin
where
the
duncan
would
be
in
comparative
safety
but
how
could
she
reach
it
all
the
passengers
were
summoned
on
deck
for
now
that
the
hour
of
shipwreck
was
at
hand
the
captain
did
not
wish
anyone
to
be
shut
up
in
his
cabin
john
said
glenarvan
in
a
low
voice
to
the
captain
i
will
try
to
save
my
wife
or
perish
with
her
i
put
miss
grant
in
your
yes
my
lord
replied
john
mangles
raising
glenarvan
s
hand
to
his
moistened
eyes
the
yacht
was
only
a
few
cables
lengths
from
the
sandbanks
the
tide
was
high
and
no
doubt
there
was
abundance
of
water
to
float
the
ship
over
the
dangerous
bar
but
these
terrific
breakers
alternately
lifting
her
up
and
then
leaving
her
almost
dry
would
infallibly
make
her
graze
the
was
there
no
means
of
calming
this
angry
sea
a
last
expedient
struck
the
captain
the
oil
my
lads
he
exclaimed
bring
the
oil
here
the
crew
caught
at
the
idea
immediately
this
was
a
plan
that
had
been
successfully
tried
already
the
fury
of
the
waves
had
been
allayed
before
this
time
by
covering
them
with
a
sheet
of
oil
its
effect
is
immediate
but
very
temporary
the
moment
after
a
ship
has
passed
over
the
smooth
surface
the
sea
redoubles
its
violence
and
woe
to
the
bark
that
follows
the
casks
of
were
forthwith
hauled
up
for
danger
seemed
to
have
given
the
men
double
strength
a
few
hatchet
blows
soon
knocked
in
the
heads
and
they
were
then
hung
over
the
larboard
and
starboard
be
ready
shouted
john
looking
out
for
a
favorable
moment
in
twenty
seconds
the
yacht
reached
the
bar
now
was
the
time
pour
out
cried
the
captain
and
god
prosper
it
the
barrels
were
turned
upside
down
and
instantly
a
sheet
of
oil
covered
the
whole
surface
of
the
water
the
billows
fell
as
if
by
magic
the
whole
foaming
sea
seemed
leveled
and
the
duncan
flew
over
its
tranquil
bosom
into
a
quiet
basin
beyond
the
formidable
bar
but
almost
the
same
minute
the
ocean
burst
forth
again
with
all
its
fury
and
the
towering
breakers
dashed
over
the
bar
with
increased
violence
chapter
vi
a
hospitable
colonist
the
captain
s
first
care
was
to
anchor
his
vessel
securely
he
found
excellent
moorage
in
five
fathoms
depth
of
water
with
a
solid
bottom
of
hard
granite
which
afforded
a
firm
hold
there
was
no
danger
now
of
either
being
driven
away
or
stranded
at
low
water
after
so
many
hours
of
danger
the
duncan
found
herself
in
a
sort
of
creek
sheltered
by
a
high
circular
point
from
the
winds
outside
in
the
open
sea
lord
glenarvan
grasped
john
mangles
hand
and
simply
said
thank
you
this
was
all
but
john
felt
it
ample
recompense
glenarvan
kept
to
himself
the
secret
of
his
anxiety
and
neither
lady
helena
nor
mary
nor
robert
suspected
the
grave
perils
they
had
just
escaped
one
important
fact
had
to
be
ascertained
on
what
part
of
the
coast
had
the
tempest
thrown
them
how
far
must
they
go
to
regain
the
parallel
at
what
distance
was
cape
bernouilli
this
was
soon
determined
by
taking
the
position
of
the
ship
and
it
was
found
that
she
had
scarcely
deviated
two
degrees
from
the
route
they
were
in
longitude
degrees
minutes
and
latitude
degrees
minutes
at
cape
catastrophe
three
hundred
miles
from
cape
bernouilli
the
nearest
port
was
adelaide
the
capital
of
southern
australia
could
the
duncan
be
repaired
there
this
was
the
question
the
extent
of
the
injuries
must
first
be
ascertained
and
in
order
to
do
this
he
ordered
some
of
the
men
to
dive
down
below
the
stern
their
report
was
that
one
of
the
branches
of
the
screw
was
bent
and
had
got
jammed
against
the
stern
post
which
of
course
prevented
all
possibility
of
rotation
this
was
a
serious
damage
so
serious
as
to
require
more
skilful
workmen
than
could
be
found
in
adelaide
after
mature
reflection
lord
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
came
to
the
determination
to
sail
round
the
australian
coast
stopping
at
cape
bernouilli
and
continuing
their
route
south
as
far
as
melbourne
where
the
duncan
could
speedily
be
put
right
this
effected
they
would
proceed
to
cruise
along
the
eastern
coast
to
complete
their
search
for
the
britannia
this
decision
was
unanimously
approved
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
start
with
the
first
fair
wind
they
had
not
to
wait
long
for
the
same
night
the
hurricane
had
ceased
entirely
and
there
was
only
a
manageable
breeze
from
the
preparations
for
sailing
were
instantly
commenced
and
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
crew
lifted
the
anchors
and
got
under
way
with
fresh
canvas
outspread
and
a
wind
blowing
right
for
the
australian
shores
two
hours
afterward
cape
catastrophe
was
out
of
sight
in
the
evening
they
doubled
cape
borda
and
came
alongside
kangaroo
island
this
is
the
largest
of
the
australian
islands
and
a
great
hiding
place
for
runaway
convicts
its
appearance
was
enchanting
the
stratified
rocks
on
the
shore
were
richly
carpeted
with
verdure
and
innumerable
kangaroos
were
jumping
over
the
woods
and
plains
just
as
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
in
next
day
boats
were
sent
ashore
to
examine
the
coast
minutely
as
they
were
now
on
the
parallel
and
between
that
and
the
glenarvan
wished
to
leave
no
part
unexplored
the
boats
had
hard
rough
work
of
it
now
but
the
men
never
complained
glenarvan
and
his
inseparable
companion
paganel
and
young
robert
generally
accompanied
them
but
all
this
painstaking
exploration
came
to
nothing
not
a
trace
of
the
shipwreck
could
be
seen
anywhere
the
australian
shores
revealed
no
more
than
the
patagonian
however
it
was
not
time
yet
to
lose
hope
altogether
for
they
had
not
reached
the
exact
point
indicated
by
the
document
on
the
of
december
they
arrived
off
cape
bernouilli
which
terminates
lacepede
bay
and
yet
not
a
vestige
of
the
britannia
had
been
discovered
still
this
was
not
surprising
as
it
was
two
years
since
the
occurrence
of
the
catastrophe
and
the
sea
might
and
indeed
must
have
scattered
and
destroyed
whatever
fragments
of
the
brig
had
remained
besides
the
natives
who
scent
a
wreck
as
the
vultures
do
a
dead
body
would
have
pounced
upon
it
and
carried
off
the
smaller
debris
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
harry
grant
and
his
companions
had
been
made
prisoners
the
moment
the
waves
threw
them
on
the
shore
and
been
dragged
away
into
the
interior
of
the
continent
but
if
so
what
becomes
of
paganel
s
ingenious
hypothesis
about
the
document
that
it
had
been
thrown
into
a
river
and
carried
by
a
current
into
the
sea
that
was
a
plausible
enough
theory
in
patagonia
but
not
in
the
part
of
australia
intersected
by
the
parallel
besides
the
patagonian
rivers
the
rio
colorado
and
the
rio
negro
flow
into
the
sea
along
deserted
solitudes
uninhabited
and
uninhabitable
while
on
the
contrary
the
principal
rivers
of
australia
the
murray
the
yarrow
the
torrens
the
darling
all
connected
with
each
other
throw
themselves
into
the
ocean
by
routes
and
their
mouths
are
ports
of
great
activity
what
likelihood
consequently
would
there
be
that
a
fragile
bottle
would
ever
find
its
way
along
such
busy
thoroughfares
right
out
into
the
indian
ocean
paganel
himself
saw
the
impossibility
of
it
and
confessed
to
the
major
who
raised
a
discussion
on
the
subject
that
his
hypothesis
would
be
altogether
illogical
in
australia
it
was
evident
that
the
degrees
given
related
to
the
place
where
the
britannia
was
actually
shipwrecked
and
not
the
place
of
captivity
and
that
the
bottle
therefore
had
been
thrown
into
the
sea
on
the
western
coast
of
the
continent
however
as
glenarvan
justly
remarked
this
did
not
alter
the
fact
of
captain
grant
s
captivity
in
the
least
degree
though
there
was
no
reason
now
for
prosecuting
the
search
for
him
along
the
parallel
more
than
any
other
it
followed
consequently
that
if
no
traces
of
the
britannia
were
discovered
at
cape
bernouilli
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
return
to
europe
lord
glenarvan
would
have
been
unsuccessful
but
he
would
have
done
his
duty
courageously
and
conscientiously
but
the
young
grants
did
not
feel
disheartened
they
had
long
since
said
to
themselves
that
the
question
of
their
father
s
deliverance
was
about
to
be
finally
settled
irrevocably
indeed
they
might
consider
it
for
as
paganel
had
judiciously
demonstrated
if
the
wreck
had
occurred
on
the
eastern
side
the
survivors
would
have
found
their
way
back
to
their
own
country
long
since
hope
on
hope
on
mary
said
lady
helena
to
the
young
girl
as
they
neared
the
shore
god
s
hand
will
still
lead

said
captain
john
man

extremity
is
god
s
opportunity
when
one
way
is
hedged
up
another
is

to
god
grant
it
replied
mary
land
was
quite
close
now
the
cape
ran
out
two
miles
into
the
sea
and
terminated
in
a
gentle
slope
and
the
boat
glided
easily
into
a
sort
of
natural
creek
between
coral
banks
in
a
state
of
formation
which
in
course
of
time
would
be
a
belt
of
coral
reefs
round
the
southern
point
of
the
australian
coast
even
now
they
were
quite
sufficiently
formidable
to
destroy
the
keel
of
a
ship
and
the
britannia
might
likely
enough
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
on
them
the
passengers
landed
without
the
least
difficulty
on
an
absolutely
desert
shore
cliffs
composed
of
beds
of
strata
made
a
coast
line
sixty
to
eighty
feet
high
which
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
scale
without
ladders
or
john
mangles
happened
to
discover
a
natural
breach
about
half
a
mile
south
part
of
the
cliff
had
been
partially
beaten
down
no
doubt
by
the
sea
in
some
equinoctial
gale
through
this
opening
the
whole
party
passed
and
reached
the
top
of
the
cliff
by
a
pretty
steep
path
robert
climbed
like
a
young
cat
and
was
the
first
on
the
summit
to
the
despair
of
paganel
who
was
quite
ashamed
to
see
his
long
legs
forty
years
old
by
a
young
urchin
of
twelve
however
he
was
far
ahead
of
the
major
who
gave
himself
no
concern
on
the
subject
they
were
all
soon
assembled
on
the
lofty
crags
and
from
this
elevation
could
command
a
view
of
the
whole
plain
below
it
appeared
entirely
uncultivated
and
covered
with
shrubs
and
bushes
glenarvan
thought
it
resembled
some
glens
in
the
lowlands
of
scotland
and
paganel
fancied
it
like
some
barren
parts
of
britanny
but
along
the
coast
the
country
appeared
to
be
inhabited
and
significant
signs
of
industry
revealed
the
presence
of
civilized
men
not
savages
a
mill
exclaimed
robert
and
sure
enough
in
the
distance
the
long
sails
of
a
mill
appeared
apparently
about
three
miles
off
it
certainly
is
a
windmill
said
paganel
after
examining
the
object
in
question
through
his
telescope
let
us
go
to
it
then
said
glenarvan
away
they
started
and
after
walking
about
half
an
hour
the
country
began
to
assume
a
new
aspect
suddenly
changing
its
sterility
for
cultivation
instead
of
bushes
hedges
met
the
eye
inclosing
recent
clearings
several
bullocks
and
about
half
a
dozen
horses
were
feeding
in
meadows
surrounded
by
acacias
supplied
from
the
vast
plantations
of
kangaroo
island
gradually
fields
covered
with
cereals
came
in
sight
whole
acres
covered
with
bristling
ears
of
corn
in
the
shape
of
large
blooming
orchards
a
fine
garden
worthy
of
horace
in
which
the
useful
and
agreeable
were
blended
then
came
sheds
commons
wisely
distributed
and
last
of
all
a
plain
comfortable
crowned
by
a
mill
and
fanned
and
shaded
by
its
long
sails
as
they
kept
constantly
moving
round
just
at
that
moment
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
came
out
of
the
house
warned
by
the
loud
barking
of
four
dogs
of
the
arrival
of
strangers
he
was
followed
by
five
handsome
strapping
lads
his
sons
and
their
mother
a
fine
tall
woman
there
was
no
mistaking
the
little
group
this
was
a
perfect
type
of
the
irish
colonist
a
man
who
weary
of
the
miseries
of
his
country
had
come
with
his
family
to
seek
fortune
and
happiness
beyond
the
seas
before
glenarvan
and
his
party
had
time
to
reach
the
house
and
present
themselves
in
due
form
they
heard
the
cordial
words

the
house
of
paddy

moore

said
glenarvan
if
i
am
not
mistaken
warmly
grasping
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
colonist
i
was
replied
paddy
o
moore
but
now
i
am
australian
come
in
gentlemen
whoever
you
may
be
this
house
is
it
was
impossible
not
to
accept
an
invitation
given
with
such
grace
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
were
led
in
by
o
moore
while
the
gentlemen
were
assisted
by
his
sturdy
sons
to
disencumber
themselves
of
their
an
immense
hall
light
and
airy
occupied
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
which
was
built
of
strong
planks
laid
horizontally
a
few
wooden
benches
fastened
against
the
walls
about
ten
stools
two
oak
chests
on
tin
mugs
a
large
long
table
where
twenty
guests
could
sit
comfortably
composed
the
furniture
which
looked
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
solid
house
and
robust
inmates
the
noonday
meal
was
spread
the
soup
tureen
was
smoking
between
roast
beef
and
a
leg
of
mutton
surrounded
by
large
plates
of
olives
grapes
and
oranges
the
necessary
was
there
and
there
was
no
lack
of
the
superfluous
the
host
and
hostess
were
so
pleasant
and
the
big
table
with
its
abundant
fare
looked
so
inviting
that
it
would
have
been
ungracious
not
to
have
seated
themselves
the
farm
servants
on
equal
footing
with
their
master
were
already
in
their
places
to
take
their
share
of
the
meal
paddy
o
moore
pointed
to
the
seats
reserved
for
the
strangers
and
said
to
glenarvan
i
was
waiting
for
waiting
for
us
replied
glenarvan
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
am
always
waiting
for
those
who
come
said
the
irishman
and
then
in
a
solemn
voice
while
the
family
and
domestics
reverently
stood
he
repeated
the
benedicite
dinner
followed
immediately
during
which
an
animated
conversation
was
kept
up
on
all
sides
from
scotch
to
irish
is
but
a
handsbreadth
the
tweed
several
fathoms
wide
digs
a
deeper
trench
between
scotland
and
england
than
the
twenty
leagues
of
irish
channel
which
separates
old
caledonia
from
the
emerald
isle
paddy
o
moore
related
his
history
it
was
that
of
all
emigrants
driven
by
misfortune
from
their
own
country
many
come
to
seek
fortunes
who
only
find
trouble
and
sorrow
and
then
they
throw
the
blame
on
chance
and
forget
the
true
cause
is
their
own
idleness
and
vice
and
want
of
commonsense
whoever
is
sober
and
industrious
honest
and
economical
gets
on
such
a
one
had
been
and
was
paddy
o
moore
he
left
dundalk
where
he
was
starving
and
came
with
his
family
to
australia
landed
at
adelaide
where
refusing
employment
as
a
miner
he
got
engaged
on
a
farm
and
two
months
afterward
commenced
clearing
ground
on
his
own
account
the
whole
territory
of
south
australia
is
divided
into
lots
each
containing
eighty
acres
and
these
are
granted
to
colonists
by
the
government
any
industrious
man
by
proper
cultivation
can
not
only
get
a
living
out
of
his
lot
but
lay
by
pounds
a
year
paddy
o
moore
knew
this
he
profited
by
his
own
former
experience
and
laid
by
every
penny
he
could
till
he
had
saved
enough
to
purchase
new
lots
his
family
prospered
and
his
farm
also
the
irish
peasant
became
a
landed
proprietor
and
though
his
little
estate
had
only
been
under
cultivation
for
two
years
he
had
five
hundred
acres
cleared
by
his
own
hands
and
five
hundred
head
of
cattle
he
was
his
own
master
after
having
been
a
serf
in
europe
and
as
independent
as
one
can
be
in
the
freest
country
in
the
world
his
guests
congratulated
him
heartily
as
he
ended
his
narration
and
paddy
o
moore
no
doubt
expected
confidence
for
confidence
but
he
waited
in
vain
however
he
was
one
of
those
discreet
people
who
can
say
i
tell
you
who
i
am
but
i
don
t
ask
who
you
glenarvan
s
great
object
was
to
get
information
about
the
britannia
and
like
a
man
who
goes
right
to
the
point
he
began
at
once
to
interrogate
o
moore
as
to
whether
he
had
heard
of
the
shipwreck
the
reply
of
the
irishman
was
not
favorable
he
had
never
heard
the
vessel
mentioned
for
two
years
at
least
no
ship
had
been
wrecked
on
that
coast
neither
above
nor
below
the
cape
now
the
date
of
the
catastrophe
was
within
two
years
he
could
therefore
declare
positively
that
the
survivors
of
the
wreck
had
not
been
thrown
on
that
part
of
the
western
shore
now
my
lord
he
added
may
i
ask
what
interest
you
have
in
making
the
inquiry
this
pointed
question
elicited
in
reply
the
whole
history
of
the
expedition
glenarvan
related
the
discovery
of
the
document
and
the
various
attempts
that
had
been
made
to
follow
up
the
precise
indications
given
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
unfortunate
captives
and
he
concluded
his
account
by
expressing
his
doubt
whether
they
should
ever
find
the
captain
after
all
his
dispirited
tone
made
a
painful
impression
on
the
minds
of
his
auditors
robert
and
mary
could
not
keep
back
their
tears
and
paganel
had
not
a
word
of
hope
or
comfort
to
give
them
john
mangles
was
grieved
to
the
heart
though
he
too
was
beginning
to
yield
to
the
feeling
of
hopelessness
which
had
crept
over
the
rest
when
suddenly
the
whole
party
were
electrified
by
hearing
a
voice
exclaim
my
lord
praise
and
thank
god
if
captain
grant
is
alive
he
is
on
this
australian
chapter
vii
the
quartermaster
of
the
britannia
the
surprise
caused
by
these
words
can
not
be
described
glenarvan
sprang
to
his
feet
and
pushing
back
his
seat
exclaimed
who
spoke
i
did
said
one
of
the
servants
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
you
ayrton
replied
his
master
not
less
bewildered
than
glenarvan
yes
it
was
i
rejoined
ayrton
in
a
firm
tone
though
somewhat
agitated
voice
a
scotchman
like
yourself
my
lord
and
one
of
the
shipwrecked
crew
of
the
the
effect
of
such
a
declaration
may
be
imagined
mary
grant
fell
back
in
lady
helena
s
arms
overcome
by
joyful
emotion
and
robert
and
mangles
and
paganel
started
up
and
toward
the
man
that
paddy
o
moore
had
addressed
as
ayrton
he
was
a
fellow
about
years
of
age
with
very
bright
eyes
though
beneath
thick
overhanging
brows
in
spite
of
extreme
leanness
there
was
an
air
of
unusual
strength
about
him
he
seemed
all
bone
and
nerves
or
to
use
a
scotch
expression
as
if
he
had
not
wasted
time
in
making
fat
he
was
and
of
middle
height
and
though
his
features
were
coarse
his
face
was
so
full
of
intelligence
and
energy
and
decision
that
he
gave
one
a
favorable
impression
the
interest
he
excited
was
still
further
heightened
by
the
marks
of
recent
suffering
imprinted
on
his
countenance
it
was
evident
that
he
had
endured
long
and
severe
hardships
and
that
he
had
borne
them
bravely
and
come
off
victor
you
are
one
of
the
shipwrecked
sailors
of
the
britannia
was
glenarvan
s
first
question
yes
my
lord
captain
grant
s
and
saved
with
him
after
the
shipwreck
no
my
lord
no
i
was
separated
from
him
at
that
terrible
moment
for
i
was
swept
off
the
deck
as
the
ship
then
you
are
not
one
of
the
two
sailors
mentioned
in
the
document
no
i
was
not
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
document
the
captain
must
have
thrown
it
into
the
sea
when
i
was
no
longer
on
but
the
captain
what
about
the
captain
i
believed
he
had
perished
gone
down
with
all
his
crew
i
imagined
myself
the
sole
but
you
said
just
now
captain
grant
was
no
i
said
the
captain
is
and
you
added
is
on
the
australian
and
indeed
he
can
not
be
anywhere
then
you
don
t
know
where
he
is
no
my
lord
i
say
again
i
supposed
he
was
buried
beneath
the
waves
or
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
rocks
it
was
from
you
i
learned
that
he
was
still
what
then
do
you
know
simply
this
if
captain
grant
is
alive
he
is
in
where
did
the
shipwreck
occur
asked
major
mcnabbs
this
should
have
been
the
first
question
but
in
the
excitement
caused
by
the
unexpected
incident
glenarvan
cared
more
to
know
where
the
captain
was
than
where
the
britannia
had
been
lost
after
the
major
s
inquiry
however
glenarvan
s
examination
proceeded
more
logically
and
before
long
all
the
details
of
the
event
stood
out
clearly
before
the
minds
of
the
company
to
the
question
put
by
the
major
ayrton
replied
when
i
was
swept
off
the
forecastle
when
i
was
hauling
in
the
the
britannia
was
running
right
on
the
australian
coast
she
was
not
more
than
two
cables
length
from
it
and
consequently
she
must
have
struck
just
in
latitude
degrees
asked
john
mangles
yes
in
latitude
on
the
west
coast
no
on
the
east
coast
was
the
prompt
reply
and
at
what
date
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
exactly
just
exactly
exclaimed
glenarvan
you
see
then
my
lord
continued
ayrton
i
might
justly
say
captain
is
alive
he
is
on
the
australian
continent
and
it
is
useless
looking
for
him
anywhere
and
we
will
look
for
him
there
and
find
him
too
and
save
him
exclaimed
paganel
ah
precious
document
he
added
with
perfect
naivete
you
must
own
you
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
uncommonly
shrewd
but
doubtless
nobody
heard
his
flattering
words
for
glenarvan
and
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
and
robert
were
too
much
engrossed
with
ayrton
to
listen
to
anyone
else
they
pressed
round
him
and
grasped
his
hands
it
seemed
as
if
this
man
s
presence
was
the
sure
pledge
of
harry
grant
s
deliverance
if
this
sailor
had
escaped
the
perils
of
the
shipwreck
why
should
not
the
captain
ayrton
was
quite
sanguine
as
to
his
existence
but
on
what
part
of
the
continent
he
was
to
be
found
that
he
could
not
say
the
replies
the
man
gave
to
the
thousand
questions
that
assailed
him
on
all
sides
were
remarkably
intelligent
and
exact
all
the
while
he
spake
mary
held
one
of
his
hands
in
hers
this
sailor
was
a
companion
of
her
father
s
one
of
the
crew
of
the
britannia
he
had
lived
with
harry
grant
crossed
the
seas
with
him
and
shared
his
dangers
mary
could
not
keep
her
eyes
off
his
face
rough
and
homely
though
it
was
and
she
wept
for
joy
up
to
this
time
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
doubting
either
the
veracity
or
identity
of
the
quartermaster
but
the
major
and
perhaps
john
mangles
now
began
to
ask
themselves
if
this
ayrton
s
word
was
to
be
absolutely
believed
there
was
something
suspicious
about
this
unexpected
meeting
certainly
the
man
had
mentioned
facts
and
dates
which
corresponded
and
the
minuteness
of
his
details
was
most
striking
still
exactness
of
details
was
no
positive
proof
indeed
it
has
been
noticed
that
a
falsehood
has
sometimes
gained
ground
by
being
exceedingly
particular
in
minutiae
mcnabbs
therefore
prudently
refrained
from
committing
himself
by
expressing
any
opinion
john
mangles
however
was
soon
convinced
when
he
heard
ayrton
speak
to
the
young
girl
about
her
father
he
knew
mary
and
robert
quite
well
he
had
seen
them
in
glasgow
when
the
ship
sailed
he
remembered
them
at
the
farewell
breakfast
given
on
board
the
britannia
to
the
captain
s
friends
at
which
sheriff
mcintyre
was
present
robert
then
a
boy
of
ten
years
old
had
been
given
into
his
charge
and
he
ran
away
and
tried
to
climb
the
rigging
yes
that
i
did
it
is
quite
right
said
robert
he
went
on
to
mention
several
other
trifling
incidents
without
attaching
the
importance
to
them
that
john
mangles
did
and
when
he
stopped
mary
grant
said
in
her
soft
voice
oh
go
on
ayrton
tell
us
more
about
our
the
quartermaster
did
his
best
to
satisfy
the
poor
girl
and
glenarvan
did
not
interrupt
him
though
a
score
of
questions
far
more
important
crowded
into
his
mind
lady
helena
made
him
look
at
mary
s
beaming
face
and
the
words
he
was
about
to
utter
remained
unspoken
ayrton
gave
an
account
of
the
britannia
s
voyage
across
the
pacific
mary
knew
most
of
it
before
as
news
of
the
ship
had
come
regularly
up
to
the
month
of
may
in
the
course
of
the
year
harry
grant
had
touched
at
all
the
principal
ports
he
had
been
to
the
hebrides
to
new
guinea
new
zealand
and
new
caledonia
and
had
succeeded
in
finding
an
important
point
on
the
western
coast
of
papua
where
the
establishment
of
a
scotch
colony
seemed
to
him
easy
and
its
prosperity
certain
a
good
port
on
the
molucca
and
philippine
route
must
attract
ships
especially
when
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
would
have
supplanted
the
cape
route
harry
grant
was
one
of
those
who
appreciated
the
great
work
of
de
lesseps
and
would
not
allow
political
rivalries
to
interfere
with
international
interests
after
reconnoitering
papua
the
britannia
went
to
provision
herself
at
callao
and
left
that
port
on
the
of
may
to
return
to
europe
by
the
indian
ocean
and
the
cape
three
weeks
afterward
his
vessel
was
disabled
by
a
fearful
storm
in
which
they
were
caught
and
obliged
to
cut
away
the
masts
a
leak
sprang
in
the
hold
and
could
not
be
stopped
the
crew
were
too
exhausted
to
work
the
pumps
and
for
eight
days
the
britannia
was
tossed
about
in
the
hurricane
like
a
shuttlecock
she
had
six
feet
of
water
in
her
hold
and
was
gradually
sinking
the
boats
had
been
all
carried
away
by
the
tempest
death
stared
them
in
the
face
when
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
as
paganel
had
rightly
supposed
they
came
in
sight
of
the
eastern
coast
of
australia
the
ship
soon
neared
the
shore
and
presently
dashed
violently
against
it
ayrton
was
swept
off
by
a
wave
and
thrown
among
the
breakers
where
he
lost
consciousness
when
he
recovered
he
found
himself
in
the
hands
of
natives
who
dragged
him
away
into
the
interior
of
the
country
since
that
time
he
had
never
heard
the
britannia
s
name
mentioned
and
reasonably
enough
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
had
gone
down
with
all
hands
off
the
dangerous
reefs
of
twofold
bay
this
ended
ayrton
s
recital
and
more
than
once
sorrowful
exclamations
were
evoked
by
the
story
the
major
could
not
in
common
justice
doubt
its
authenticity
the
sailor
was
then
asked
to
narrate
his
own
personal
history
which
was
short
and
simple
enough
he
had
been
carried
by
a
tribe
of
natives
four
hundred
miles
north
of
the
parallel
he
spent
a
miserable
existence
there
not
that
he
was
but
the
natives
themselves
lived
miserably
he
passed
two
long
years
of
painful
slavery
among
them
but
always
cherished
in
his
heart
the
hope
of
one
day
regaining
his
freedom
and
watching
for
the
slightest
opportunity
that
might
turn
up
though
he
knew
that
his
flight
would
be
attended
with
innumerable
dangers
at
length
one
night
in
october
he
managed
to
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
natives
and
took
refuge
in
the
depths
of
immense
forests
for
a
whole
month
he
subsisted
on
roots
edible
ferns
and
mimosa
gums
wandering
through
vast
solitudes
guiding
himself
by
the
sun
during
the
day
and
by
the
stars
at
night
he
went
on
though
often
almost
despairingly
through
bogs
and
rivers
and
across
mountains
till
he
had
traversed
the
whole
of
the
uninhabited
part
of
the
continent
where
only
a
few
bold
travelers
have
ventured
and
at
last
in
an
exhausted
and
all
but
dying
condition
he
reached
the
hospitable
dwelling
of
paddy
o
moore
where
he
said
he
had
found
a
happy
home
in
exchange
for
his
labor
and
if
ayrton
speaks
well
of
me
said
the
irish
settler
when
the
narrative
ended
i
have
nothing
but
good
to
say
of
him
he
is
an
honest
intelligent
fellow
and
a
good
worker
and
as
long
as
he
pleases
paddy
o
moore
s
house
shall
be
ayrton
thanked
him
by
a
gesture
and
waited
silently
for
any
fresh
question
that
might
be
put
to
him
though
he
thought
to
himself
that
he
surely
must
have
satisfied
all
legitimate
curiosity
what
could
remain
to
be
said
that
he
had
not
said
a
hundred
times
already
glenarvan
was
just
about
to
open
a
discussion
about
their
future
plan
of
action
profiting
by
this
rencontre
with
ayrton
and
by
the
information
he
had
given
them
when
major
mcnabbs
addressing
the
sailor
said
you
were
quartermaster
you
say
on
the
britannia
yes
replied
ayrton
without
the
least
hesitation
but
as
if
conscious
that
a
certain
feeling
of
mistrust
however
slight
had
prompted
the
inquiry
he
added
i
have
my
shipping
papers
with
me
i
saved
them
from
the
he
left
the
room
immediately
to
fetch
his
official
document
and
though
hardly
absent
a
minute
paddy
o
moore
managed
to
say
my
lord
you
may
trust
ayrton
i
vouch
for
his
being
an
honest
man
he
has
been
two
months
now
in
my
service
and
i
have
never
had
once
to
find
fault
with
him
i
knew
all
this
story
of
his
shipwreck
and
his
captivity
he
is
a
true
man
worthy
of
your
entire
glenarvan
was
on
the
point
of
replying
that
he
had
never
doubted
his
good
faith
when
the
man
came
in
and
brought
his
engagement
written
out
in
due
form
it
was
a
paper
signed
by
the
shipowners
and
captain
grant
mary
recognized
her
father
s
writing
at
once
it
was
to
certify
that
tom
ayrton
seaman
was
engaged
as
quartermaster
on
board
the
vessel
the
britannia
there
could
not
possibly
be
the
least
doubt
now
of
ayrton
s
identity
for
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
account
for
his
possession
of
the
document
if
he
were
not
the
man
named
in
it
now
then
said
glenarvan
i
wish
to
ask
everyone
s
opinion
as
to
what
is
best
to
be
done
your
advice
ayrton
will
be
particularly
valuable
and
i
shall
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
let
us
have
after
a
few
minutes
thought
ayrton
replied
i
thank
you
my
lord
for
the
confidence
you
show
towards
me
and
i
hope
to
prove
worthy
of
it
i
have
some
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
habits
of
the
natives
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
most
certainly
you
can
interrupted
glenarvan
i
think
with
you
resumed
ayrton
that
the
captain
and
his
two
sailors
have
escaped
alive
from
the
wreck
but
since
they
have
not
found
their
way
to
the
english
settlement
nor
been
seen
any
where
i
have
no
doubt
that
their
fate
has
been
similar
to
my
own
and
that
they
are
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
some
of
the
native
that
s
exactly
what
i
have
always
argued
said
paganel
the
shipwrecked
men
were
taken
prisoners
as
they
feared
but
must
we
conclude
without
question
that
like
yourself
they
have
been
dragged
away
north
of
the
parallel
i
should
suppose
so
sir
for
hostile
tribes
would
hardly
remain
anywhere
near
the
districts
under
the
british
that
will
complicate
our
search
said
glenarvan
somewhat
disconcerted
how
can
we
possibly
find
traces
of
the
captives
in
the
heart
of
so
vast
a
continent
no
one
replied
though
lady
helena
s
questioning
glances
at
her
companions
seemed
to
press
for
an
answer
paganel
even
was
silent
his
ingenuity
for
once
was
at
fault
john
mangles
paced
the
cabin
with
great
strides
as
if
he
fancied
himself
on
the
deck
of
his
ship
evidently
quite
nonplussed
and
you
ayrton
said
lady
helena
at
last
what
would
you
do
madam
replied
ayrton
readily
enough
i
should
in
the
duncan
and
go
right
to
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
there
i
should
be
guided
by
circumstances
and
by
any
chance
indications
we
might
very
good
returned
glenarvan
but
we
must
wait
till
the
duncan
is
ah
she
has
been
injured
then
said
ayrton
yes
replied
mangles
to
any
serious
extent
no
but
such
injuries
as
require
more
skilful
workmanship
than
we
have
on
board
one
of
the
branches
of
the
screw
is
twisted
and
we
can
not
get
it
repaired
nearer
than
well
let
the
ship
go
to
melbourne
then
said
paganel
and
we
will
go
without
her
to
twofold
and
how
asked
mangles
by
crossing
australia
as
we
crossed
america
keeping
along
the
but
the
duncan
repeated
ayrton
as
if
particularly
anxious
on
that
score
the
duncan
can
rejoin
us
or
we
can
rejoin
her
as
the
case
may
be
should
we
discover
captain
grant
in
the
course
of
our
journey
we
can
all
return
together
to
melbourne
if
we
have
to
go
on
to
the
coast
on
the
contrary
then
the
duncan
can
come
to
us
there
who
has
any
objection
to
make
have
you
major
no
not
if
there
is
a
practicable
route
across
so
practicable
that
i
propose
lady
helena
and
miss
grant
should
accompany
are
you
speaking
seriously
asked
glenarvan
perfectly
so
my
lord
it
is
a
journey
of
miles
not
more
if
we
go
twelve
miles
a
day
it
will
barely
take
us
a
month
just
long
enough
to
put
the
vessel
in
trim
if
we
had
to
cross
the
continent
in
a
lower
latitude
at
its
wildest
part
and
traverse
immense
deserts
where
there
is
no
water
and
where
the
heat
is
tropical
and
go
where
the
most
adventurous
travelers
have
never
yet
ventured
that
would
be
a
different
matter
but
the
parallel
cuts
only
through
the
province
of
victoria
quite
an
english
country
with
roads
and
railways
and
well
populated
almost
everywhere
it
is
a
journey
you
might
make
almost
in
a
chaise
though
a
wagon
would
be
better
it
is
a
mere
trip
from
london
to
edinburgh
nothing
what
about
wild
beasts
though
asked
glenarvan
anxious
to
go
into
all
the
difficulties
of
the
proposal
there
are
no
wild
beasts
in
and
how
about
the
savages
there
are
no
savages
in
this
latitude
and
if
there
were
they
are
not
cruel
like
the
new
and
the
convicts
there
are
no
convicts
in
the
southern
provinces
only
in
the
eastern
colonies
the
province
of
victoria
not
only
refused
to
admit
them
but
passed
a
law
to
prevent
any
men
from
other
provinces
from
entering
her
territories
this
very
year
the
government
threatened
to
withdraw
its
subsidy
from
the
peninsular
company
if
their
vessels
continued
to
take
in
coal
in
those
western
parts
of
australia
where
convicts
are
admitted
what
don
t
you
know
that
and
you
an
englishman
in
the
first
place
i
beg
leave
to
say
i
am
not
an
englishman
replied
glenarvan
what
paganel
says
is
perfectly
correct
said
paddy
o
moore
not
only
the
province
of
victoria
but
also
southern
australia
queensland
and
even
tasmania
have
agreed
to
expel
convicts
from
their
territories
ever
since
i
have
been
on
this
farm
i
have
never
heard
of
one
in
this
and
i
can
speak
for
myself
i
have
never
come
across
you
see
then
friends
went
on
jacques
paganel
there
are
few
if
any
savages
no
ferocious
animals
no
convicts
and
there
are
not
many
countries
of
europe
for
which
you
can
say
as
much
well
will
you
go
what
do
you
think
helena
asked
glenarvan
what
we
all
think
dear
edward
replied
lady
helena
turning
toward
her
companions
let
us
be
off
at
chapter
viii
preparation
for
the
journey
glenarvan
never
lost
much
time
between
adopting
an
idea
and
carrying
it
out
as
soon
as
he
consented
to
paganel
s
proposition
he
gave
immediate
orders
to
make
arrangements
for
the
journey
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
the
time
of
starting
was
fixed
for
the
of
december
the
next
day
but
one
what
results
might
not
come
out
of
this
journey
the
presence
of
harry
grant
had
become
an
indisputable
fact
and
the
chances
of
finding
him
had
increased
not
that
anyone
expected
to
discover
the
captain
exactly
on
the
parallel
which
they
intended
strictly
to
follow
but
they
might
come
upon
his
track
and
at
all
events
they
were
going
to
the
actual
spot
where
the
wreck
had
occurred
that
was
the
principal
point
besides
if
ayrton
consented
to
join
them
and
act
as
their
guide
through
the
forests
of
the
province
of
victoria
and
right
to
the
eastern
coast
they
would
have
a
fresh
chance
of
success
glenarvan
was
sensible
of
this
and
asked
his
host
whether
he
would
have
any
great
objection
to
his
asking
ayrton
to
accompany
them
for
he
felt
particularly
desirous
of
securing
the
assistance
of
harry
grant
s
old
companion
paddy
o
moore
consented
though
he
would
regret
the
loss
of
his
excellent
servant
well
then
ayrton
will
you
come
with
us
in
our
search
expedition
ayrton
did
not
reply
immediately
he
even
showed
signs
of
hesitation
but
at
last
after
due
reflection
said
yes
my
lord
i
will
go
with
you
and
if
i
can
not
take
you
to
captain
grant
i
can
at
least
take
you
to
the
very
place
where
his
ship
thanks
one
question
my
well
where
will
you
meet
the
duncan
again
at
melbourne
unless
we
traverse
the
whole
continent
from
coast
to
but
the
captain
the
captain
will
await
my
instructions
in
the
port
of
you
may
depend
on
me
then
my
i
will
the
quartermaster
was
warmly
thanked
by
the
passengers
of
the
duncan
and
the
children
loaded
him
with
caresses
everyone
rejoiced
in
his
decision
except
the
irishman
who
lost
in
him
an
intelligent
and
faithful
helper
but
paddy
understood
the
importance
glenarvan
attached
to
the
presence
of
the
man
and
submitted
the
whole
party
then
returned
to
the
ship
after
arranging
a
rendezvous
with
ayrton
and
ordering
him
to
procure
the
necessary
means
of
conveyance
across
the
country
when
john
mangles
supported
the
proposition
of
paganel
he
took
for
granted
that
he
should
accompany
the
expedition
he
began
to
speak
to
glenarvan
at
once
about
it
and
adduced
all
sorts
of
arguments
to
advance
his
cause
his
devotion
to
lady
helena
and
his
lordship
how
useful
could
he
be
in
organizing
the
party
and
how
useless
on
board
the
duncan
everything
in
fact
but
the
main
reason
and
that
he
had
no
need
to
bring
forward
i
ll
only
ask
you
one
question
john
said
glenarvan
have
you
entire
confidence
in
your
chief
officer
absolute
replied
mangles
tom
austin
is
a
good
sailor
he
will
take
the
ship
to
her
destination
see
that
the
repairs
are
skilfully
executed
and
bring
her
back
on
the
appointed
day
tom
is
a
slave
to
duty
and
discipline
never
would
he
take
it
upon
himself
to
alter
or
retard
the
execution
of
an
order
your
lordship
may
rely
on
him
as
on
very
well
then
john
replied
glenarvan
you
shall
go
with
us
for
it
would
be
advisable
he
added
smiling
that
you
should
be
there
when
we
find
mary
grant
s
oh
your
lordship
murmured
john
turning
pale
he
could
say
no
more
but
grasped
lord
glenarvan
s
hand
next
day
john
mangles
and
the
ship
s
carpenter
accompanied
by
sailors
carrying
provisions
went
back
to
paddy
o
moore
s
house
to
consult
the
irishman
about
the
best
method
of
transport
all
the
family
met
him
ready
to
give
their
best
help
ayrton
was
there
and
gave
the
benefit
of
his
experience
on
one
point
both
he
and
paddy
agreed
that
the
journey
should
be
made
in
a
by
the
ladies
and
that
the
gentlemen
should
ride
on
horseback
paddy
could
furnish
both
bullocks
and
vehicle
the
vehicle
was
a
cart
twenty
feet
long
covered
over
by
a
tilt
and
resting
on
four
large
wheels
without
spokes
or
felloes
or
iron
tires
in
a
word
plain
wooden
discs
the
front
and
hinder
part
were
connected
by
means
of
a
rude
mechanical
contrivance
which
did
not
allow
of
the
vehicle
turning
quickly
there
was
a
pole
in
front
feet
long
to
which
the
bullocks
were
to
be
yoked
in
couples
these
animals
were
able
to
draw
both
with
head
and
neck
as
their
yoke
was
fastened
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
to
this
a
collar
was
attached
by
an
iron
peg
it
required
great
skill
to
drive
such
a
long
narrow
shaky
concern
and
to
guide
such
a
team
by
a
goad
but
ayrton
had
served
his
apprenticeship
to
it
on
the
irishman
s
farm
and
paddy
could
answer
for
his
competency
the
role
of
conductor
was
therefore
assigned
to
him
there
were
no
springs
to
the
wagon
and
consequently
it
was
not
likely
to
be
very
comfortable
but
such
as
it
was
they
had
to
take
it
but
if
the
rough
construction
could
not
be
altered
john
mangles
resolved
that
the
interior
should
be
made
as
easy
as
possible
his
first
care
was
to
divide
it
into
two
compartments
by
a
wooden
partition
the
back
one
was
intended
for
the
provisions
and
luggage
and
olbinett
s
portable
kitchen
the
front
was
set
apart
especially
for
the
ladies
and
under
the
carpenter
s
hands
was
to
be
speedily
converted
into
a
comfortable
room
covered
with
a
thick
carpet
and
fitted
up
with
a
toilet
table
and
two
couches
thick
leather
curtains
shut
in
this
apartment
and
protected
the
occupants
from
the
chilliness
of
the
nights
in
case
of
necessity
the
gentlemen
might
shelter
themselves
here
when
the
violent
rains
came
on
but
a
tent
was
to
be
their
usual
when
the
caravan
camped
for
the
night
john
mangles
exercised
all
his
ingenuity
in
furnishing
the
small
space
with
everything
that
the
two
ladies
could
possibly
require
and
he
succeeded
so
well
that
neither
lady
helena
nor
mary
had
much
reason
to
regret
leaving
their
cosy
cabins
on
board
the
duncan
for
the
rest
of
the
party
the
preparations
were
soon
made
for
they
needed
much
less
strong
horses
were
provided
for
lord
glenarvan
paganel
robert
grant
mcnabbs
and
john
mangles
also
for
the
two
sailors
wilson
and
mulrady
who
were
to
accompany
their
captain
ayrton
s
place
was
of
course
to
be
in
front
of
the
wagon
and
olbinett
who
did
not
much
care
for
equitation
was
to
make
room
for
himself
among
the
baggage
horses
and
bullocks
were
grazing
in
the
irishman
s
meadows
ready
to
fetch
at
a
moment
s
notice
after
all
arrangements
were
made
and
the
carpenter
set
to
work
john
mangles
escorted
the
irishman
and
his
family
back
to
the
vessel
for
paddy
wished
to
return
the
visit
of
lord
glenarvan
ayrton
thought
proper
to
go
too
and
about
four
o
clock
the
party
came
over
the
side
of
the
duncan
they
were
received
with
open
arms
glenarvan
would
not
be
outstripped
in
politeness
and
invited
his
visitors
to
stop
and
dine
his
hospitality
was
willingly
accepted
paddy
was
quite
amazed
at
the
splendor
of
the
saloon
and
was
loud
in
admiration
of
the
fitting
up
of
the
cabins
and
the
carpets
and
hangings
as
well
as
of
the
polished
of
the
upper
deck
ayrton
s
approbation
was
much
less
hearty
for
he
considered
it
mere
costly
superfluity
but
when
he
examined
the
yacht
with
a
sailor
s
eye
the
quartermaster
of
the
britannia
was
as
enthusiastic
about
it
as
paddy
he
went
down
into
the
hold
inspected
the
screw
department
and
the
examining
the
engine
thoroughly
and
inquired
about
its
power
and
consumption
he
explored
the
the
the
and
armory
in
which
last
he
seemed
to
be
particularly
attracted
by
a
cannon
mounted
on
the
forecastle
glenarvan
saw
he
had
to
do
with
a
man
who
understood
such
matters
as
was
evident
from
his
questions
ayrton
concluded
his
investigations
by
a
survey
of
the
masts
and
rigging
you
have
a
fine
vessel
my
lord
he
said
after
his
curiosity
was
satisfied
a
good
one
and
that
is
best
replied
glenarvan
and
what
is
her
tonnage
two
hundred
and
ten
i
don
t
think
i
am
far
out
continued
ayrton
in
judging
her
speed
at
fifteen
knots
i
should
say
she
could
do
that
say
seventeen
put
in
john
mangles
and
you
ve
hit
the
seventeen
exclaimed
the
quartermaster
why
not
a
not
the
best
among
them
i
mean
could
chase
her
not
one
replied
mangles
the
duncan
is
a
regular
racing
yacht
and
would
never
let
herself
be
even
at
sailing
asked
ayrton
even
at
well
my
lord
and
you
too
captain
returned
ayrton
allow
a
sailor
who
knows
what
a
ship
is
worth
to
compliment
you
on
stay
on
board
of
her
then
ayrton
said
glenarvan
it
rests
with
yourself
to
call
it
i
will
think
of
it
my
lord
was
all
ayrton
s
reply
just
then
olbinett
came
to
announce
dinner
and
his
lordship
repaired
with
his
guests
to
the
saloon
that
ayrton
is
an
intelligent
man
said
paganel
to
the
major
too
intelligent
muttered
mcnabbs
who
without
any
apparent
reason
had
taken
a
great
dislike
to
the
face
and
manners
of
the
quartermaster
during
the
dinner
ayrton
gave
some
interesting
details
about
the
australian
continent
which
he
knew
perfectly
he
asked
how
many
sailors
were
going
to
accompany
the
expedition
and
seemed
astonished
to
hear
that
only
two
were
going
he
advised
glenarvan
to
take
all
his
best
men
and
even
urged
him
to
do
it
which
advice
by
the
way
ought
to
have
removed
the
major
s
suspicion
but
said
glenarvan
our
journey
is
not
dangerous
is
it
not
at
all
replied
ayrton
quickly
well
then
we
ll
have
all
the
men
we
can
on
board
hands
will
be
wanted
to
work
the
ship
and
to
help
in
the
repairs
besides
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
she
should
meet
us
to
the
very
day
at
whatever
place
may
be
ultimately
selected
consequently
we
must
not
lessen
her
ayrton
said
nothing
more
as
if
convinced
his
lordship
was
right
when
evening
came
scotch
and
irish
separated
ayrton
and
paddy
o
moore
and
family
returned
home
horses
and
wagons
were
to
be
ready
the
next
day
and
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
was
fixed
for
starting
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
soon
made
their
preparations
they
had
less
to
do
than
jacques
paganel
for
he
spent
half
the
night
in
arranging
and
wiping
and
rubbing
up
the
lenses
of
his
telescope
of
course
next
morning
he
slept
on
till
the
major
s
stentorian
voice
roused
him
the
luggage
was
already
conveyed
to
the
farm
thanks
to
john
mangles
and
a
boat
was
waiting
to
take
the
passengers
they
were
soon
seated
and
the
young
captain
gave
his
final
orders
to
tom
austin
his
chief
officer
he
impressed
upon
him
that
he
was
to
wait
at
melbourne
for
lord
glenarvan
s
commands
and
to
obey
them
scrupulously
whatever
they
might
be
the
old
sailor
told
john
he
might
rely
on
him
and
in
the
name
of
the
men
begged
to
offer
his
lordship
their
best
wishes
for
the
success
of
this
new
expedition
a
storm
of
hurrahs
burst
forth
from
the
yacht
as
the
boat
rowed
off
in
ten
minutes
the
shore
was
reached
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
the
irishman
s
farm
all
was
ready
lady
helena
was
enchanted
with
her
installation
the
huge
chariot
with
its
primitive
wheels
and
massive
planks
pleased
her
particularly
the
six
bullocks
yoked
in
pairs
had
a
patriarchal
air
about
them
which
took
her
fancy
ayrton
goad
in
hand
stood
waiting
the
orders
of
this
new
master
my
word
said
paganel
this
is
a
famous
vehicle
it
beats
all
the
in
the
world
i
don
t
know
a
better
fashion
of
traveling
than
in
a
mountebank
s
caravan
a
movable
house
which
goes
or
stops
wherever
you
please
what
can
one
wish
better
the
samaratians
understood
that
and
never
traveled
in
any
other
monsieur
paganel
said
lady
helena
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
my
assuredly
madam
i
should
count
it
an
honor
have
you
fixed
the
day
i
shall
be
at
home
every
day
to
my
friends
replied
lady
helena
and
you
are
the
most
devoted
among
them
all
interrupted
paganel
gaily
these
mutual
compliments
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
seven
horses
saddled
and
ready
they
were
brought
by
paddy
s
sons
and
lord
glenarvan
paid
the
sum
stipulated
for
his
various
purchases
adding
his
cordial
thanks
which
the
worthy
irishman
valued
at
least
as
much
as
his
golden
guineas
the
signal
was
given
to
start
and
lady
helena
and
mary
took
their
places
in
the
reserved
compartment
ayrton
seated
himself
in
front
and
olbinett
scrambled
in
among
the
luggage
the
rest
of
the
party
well
armed
with
carbines
and
revolvers
mounted
their
horses
ayrton
gave
a
peculiar
cry
and
his
team
set
off
the
wagon
shook
and
the
planks
creaked
and
the
axles
grated
in
the
naves
of
the
wheels
and
before
long
the
hospitable
farm
of
the
irishman
was
out
of
sight
chapter
ix
a
country
of
paradoxes
it
was
the
of
december
a
dull
damp
dreary
month
in
the
northern
hemisphere
but
on
the
australian
continent
it
might
be
called
june
the
hottest
season
of
the
year
had
already
commenced
and
the
sun
s
rays
were
almost
tropical
when
lord
glenarvan
started
on
his
new
expedition
most
fortunately
the
parallel
did
not
cross
the
immense
deserts
inaccessible
regions
which
have
cost
many
martyrs
to
science
already
glenarvan
could
never
have
encountered
them
he
had
only
to
do
with
the
southern
part
of
australia
with
a
narrow
portion
of
the
province
of
adelaide
with
the
whole
of
victoria
and
with
the
top
of
the
reversed
triangle
which
forms
new
south
wales
it
is
scarcely
miles
from
cape
bernouilli
to
the
frontiers
of
victoria
it
was
not
above
a
two
days
march
and
ayrton
reckoned
on
their
sleeping
next
night
at
apsley
the
most
westerly
town
of
victoria
the
commencement
of
a
journey
is
always
marked
by
ardor
both
in
the
horses
and
the
horsemen
this
is
well
enough
in
the
horsemen
but
if
the
horses
are
to
go
far
their
speed
must
be
moderated
and
their
strength
husbanded
it
was
therefore
fixed
that
the
average
journey
every
day
should
not
be
more
than
from
to
thirty
miles
besides
the
pace
of
the
horses
must
be
regulated
by
the
slower
pace
of
the
bullocks
truly
mechanical
engines
which
lose
in
time
what
they
gain
in
power
the
wagon
with
its
passengers
and
provisions
was
the
very
center
of
the
caravan
the
moving
fortress
the
horsemen
might
act
as
scouts
but
must
never
be
far
away
from
it
as
no
special
marching
order
had
been
agreed
upon
everybody
was
at
liberty
to
follow
his
inclinations
within
certain
limits
the
hunters
could
scour
the
plain
amiable
folks
could
talk
to
the
fair
occupants
of
the
wagon
and
philosophers
could
philosophize
paganel
who
was
all
three
combined
had
to
be
and
was
everywhere
at
once
the
march
across
adelaide
presented
nothing
of
any
particular
interest
a
succession
of
low
hills
rich
in
dust
a
long
stretch
of
what
they
call
in
australia
bush
several
prairies
covered
with
a
small
prickly
bush
considered
a
great
dainty
by
the
ovine
tribe
embraced
many
miles
here
and
there
they
noticed
a
species
of
sheep
peculiar
to
new
holland
sheep
with
pig
s
heads
feeding
between
the
posts
of
the
telegraph
line
recently
made
between
adelaide
and
the
coast
up
to
this
time
there
had
been
a
singular
resemblance
in
the
country
to
the
monotonous
plains
of
the
argentine
pampas
there
was
the
same
grassy
flat
soil
the
same
horizon
against
the
sky
mcnabbs
declared
they
had
never
changed
countries
but
paganel
told
him
to
wait
and
he
would
soon
see
a
difference
and
on
the
faith
of
this
assurance
marvelous
things
were
expected
by
the
whole
party
in
this
fashion
after
a
march
of
sixty
miles
in
two
days
the
caravan
reached
the
parish
of
apsley
the
first
town
in
the
province
of
victoria
in
the
wimerra
district
the
wagon
was
put
up
at
the
crown
inn
supper
was
soon
smoking
on
the
table
it
consisted
solely
of
mutton
served
up
in
various
ways
they
all
ate
heartily
but
talked
more
than
they
ate
eagerly
asking
paganel
questions
about
the
wonders
of
the
country
they
were
just
beginning
to
traverse
the
amiable
geographer
needed
no
pressing
and
told
them
first
that
this
part
of
it
was
called
australia
felix
wrongly
named
he
continued
it
had
better
have
been
called
rich
for
it
is
true
of
countries
as
individuals
that
riches
do
not
make
happiness
thanks
to
her
gold
mines
australia
has
been
abandoned
to
wild
devastating
adventurers
you
will
come
across
them
when
we
reach
the
gold
is
not
the
colony
of
victoria
of
but
a
recent
origin
asked
lady
glenarvan
yes
madam
it
only
numbers
thirty
years
of
existence
it
was
on
the
of
june
on
a
tuesday
at
a
quarter
past
seven
in
the
evening
put
in
the
major
who
delighted
in
teasing
the
frenchman
about
his
precise
dates
no
at
ten
minutes
past
seven
replied
the
geographer
gravely
that
batman
and
falckner
first
began
a
settlement
at
port
phillip
the
bay
on
which
the
large
city
of
melbourne
now
stands
for
fifteen
years
the
colony
was
part
of
new
south
wales
and
recognized
sydney
as
the
capital
but
in
she
was
declared
independent
and
took
the
name
of
and
has
greatly
increased
in
prosperity
since
then
i
believe
said
glenarvan
judge
for
yourself
my
noble
friend
replied
paganel
here
are
the
numbers
given
by
the
last
statistics
and
let
mcnabbs
say
as
he
likes
i
know
nothing
more
eloquent
than
go
on
said
the
major
well
then
in
the
colony
of
port
phillip
had
inhabitants
the
province
of
victoria
numbers
seven
millions
of
vines
produce
annually
gallons
of
wine
there
are
horses
spreading
over
the
plains
and
horned
cattle
graze
in
her
is
there
not
also
a
certain
number
of
pigs
inquired
mcnabbs
yes
major
and
how
many
sheep
including
the
one
we
are
eating
at
this
no
without
counting
that
since
it
is
three
parts
bravo
monsieur
paganel
exclaimed
lady
helena
laughing
heartily
it
must
be
owned
you
are
posted
up
in
geographical
questions
and
my
cousin
mcnabbs
need
not
try
and
find
you
it
is
my
calling
madam
to
know
this
sort
of
thing
and
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
my
information
when
you
please
you
may
therefore
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
wonderful
things
are
in
store
for
you
in
this
strange
it
does
not
look
like
it
at
present
said
mcnabbs
on
purpose
to
tease
paganel
just
wait
impatient
major
was
his
rejoinder
you
have
hardly
put
your
foot
on
the
frontier
when
you
turn
round
and
abuse
it
well
i
say
and
say
again
and
will
always
maintain
that
this
is
the
most
curious
country
on
the
earth
its
formation
and
nature
and
products
and
climate
and
even
its
future
disappearance
have
amazed
and
are
now
amazing
and
will
amaze
all
the
savants
in
the
world
think
my
friends
of
a
continent
the
margin
of
which
instead
of
the
center
rose
out
of
the
waves
originally
like
a
gigantic
ring
which
encloses
perhaps
in
its
center
a
sea
partly
evaporated
the
waves
of
which
are
drying
up
daily
where
humidity
does
not
exist
either
in
the
air
or
in
the
soil
where
the
trees
lose
their
bark
every
year
instead
of
their
leaves
where
the
leaves
present
their
sides
to
the
sun
and
not
their
face
and
consequently
give
no
shade
where
the
wood
is
often
incombustible
where
stones
are
dissolved
by
the
rain
where
the
forests
are
low
and
the
grasses
gigantic
where
the
animals
are
strange
where
quadrupeds
have
beaks
like
the
echidna
or
ornithorhynchus
and
naturalists
have
been
obliged
to
create
a
special
order
for
them
called
monotremes
where
the
kangaroos
leap
on
unequal
legs
and
sheep
have
pigs
heads
where
foxes
fly
about
from
tree
to
tree
where
the
swans
are
black
where
rats
make
nests
where
the
opens
her
to
receive
visits
from
her
feathered
friends
where
the
birds
astonish
the
imagination
by
the
variety
of
their
notes
and
their
aptness
where
one
bird
serves
for
a
clock
and
another
makes
a
sound
like
a
postilion
cracking
of
a
whip
and
a
third
imitates
a
and
a
fourth
the
motion
of
a
pendulum
where
one
laughs
when
the
sun
rises
and
another
cries
when
the
sun
sets
oh
strange
illogical
country
land
of
paradoxes
and
anomalies
if
ever
there
was
one
on
earth
the
learned
botanist
grimard
was
right
when
he
said
there
is
that
australia
a
sort
of
parody
or
rather
a
defiance
of
universal
laws
in
the
face
of
the
rest
of
the
paganel
s
tirade
was
poured
forth
in
the
most
impetuous
manner
and
seemed
as
if
it
were
never
coming
to
an
end
the
eloquent
secretary
of
the
geographical
society
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
he
went
on
and
on
gesticulating
furiously
and
brandishing
his
fork
to
the
imminent
danger
of
his
neighbors
but
at
last
his
voice
was
drowned
in
a
thunder
of
applause
and
he
managed
to
stop
certainly
after
such
an
enumeration
of
australian
peculiarities
he
might
have
been
left
in
peace
but
the
major
said
in
the
coolest
tone
possible
and
is
that
all
paganel
no
indeed
not
rejoined
the
frenchman
with
renewed
vehemence
what
exclaimed
lady
helena
there
are
more
wonders
still
in
australia
yes
madam
its
climate
it
is
even
stranger
than
its
is
it
possible
they
all
said
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
hygienic
qualities
of
the
climate
continued
paganel
rich
as
it
is
in
oxygen
and
poor
in
azote
there
are
no
damp
winds
because
the
trade
winds
blow
regularly
on
the
coasts
and
most
diseases
are
unknown
from
typhus
to
measles
and
chronic
still
that
is
no
small
advantage
said
glenarvan
no
doubt
but
i
am
not
referring
to
that
but
to
one
quality
it
has
which
is
and
what
is
that
you
will
never
believe
yes
we
will
exclaimed
his
auditors
their
curiosity
aroused
by
this
preamble
well
it
is
it
is
what
it
is
a
moral
a
moral
regeneration
yes
replied
the
savant
in
a
tone
of
conviction
here
metals
do
not
get
rust
on
them
by
exposure
to
the
air
nor
men
here
the
pure
dry
atmosphere
whitens
everything
rapidly
both
linen
and
souls
the
virtue
of
the
climate
must
have
been
well
known
in
england
when
they
determined
to
send
their
criminals
here
to
be
what
do
you
mean
to
say
the
climate
has
really
any
such
influence
said
lady
helena
yes
madam
both
on
animals
and
you
are
not
joking
monsieur
paganel
i
am
not
madam
the
horses
and
the
cattle
here
are
of
incomparable
docility
you
see
it
it
is
impossible
but
it
is
a
fact
and
the
convicts
transported
into
this
reviving
salubrious
air
become
regenerated
in
a
few
years
philanthropists
know
this
in
australia
all
natures
grow
but
what
is
to
become
of
you
then
monsieur
paganel
in
this
privileged
country
you
who
are
so
good
already
said
lady
helena
what
will
you
turn
out
excellent
madam
just
excellent
and
that
s
chapter
x
an
accident
the
next
day
the
of
december
they
started
at
daybreak
the
heat
was
already
considerable
but
not
unbearable
and
the
road
was
smooth
and
good
and
allowed
the
cavalcade
to
make
speedy
progress
in
the
evening
they
camped
on
the
banks
of
the
white
lake
the
waters
of
which
are
brackish
and
undrinkable
jacques
paganel
was
obliged
to
own
that
the
name
of
this
lake
was
a
complete
misnomer
for
the
waters
were
no
more
white
than
the
black
sea
is
black
or
the
red
sea
red
or
the
yellow
river
yellow
or
the
blue
mountains
blue
however
he
argued
and
disputed
the
point
with
all
the
of
a
geographer
but
his
reasoning
made
no
impression
olbinett
prepared
the
evening
meal
with
his
accustomed
punctuality
and
after
this
was
dispatched
the
travelers
disposed
themselves
for
the
night
in
the
wagon
and
in
the
tent
and
were
soon
sleeping
soundly
notwithstanding
the
melancholy
howling
of
the
dingoes
the
jackals
of
australia
a
magnificent
plain
thickly
covered
with
chrysanthemums
stretched
out
beyond
the
lake
and
glenarvan
and
his
friends
would
gladly
have
explored
its
beauties
when
they
awoke
next
morning
but
they
had
to
start
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
was
visible
but
one
stretch
of
prairie
enameled
with
flower
in
all
the
freshness
and
abundance
of
spring
the
blue
flowers
of
the
flax
combined
with
the
bright
hues
of
the
scarlet
acanthus
a
flower
peculiar
to
the
country
a
few
cassowaries
were
bounding
over
the
plain
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
near
them
the
major
was
fortunate
enough
however
to
hit
one
very
rare
animal
with
a
ball
in
the
leg
this
was
the
jabiru
a
species
which
is
fast
disappearing
the
gigantic
crane
of
the
english
colonies
this
winged
creature
was
five
feet
high
and
his
wide
conical
extremely
pointed
beak
measured
eighteen
inches
in
length
the
violet
and
purple
tints
of
his
head
contrasted
vividly
with
the
glossy
green
of
his
neck
and
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
his
throat
and
the
bright
red
of
his
long
legs
nature
seems
to
have
exhausted
in
its
favor
all
the
primitive
colors
on
her
palette
great
admiration
was
bestowed
on
this
bird
and
the
major
s
spoil
would
have
borne
the
honors
of
the
day
had
not
robert
come
across
an
animal
a
few
miles
further
on
and
bravely
killed
it
it
was
a
shapeless
creature
half
porcupine
half
a
sort
of
unfinished
animal
belonging
to
the
first
stage
of
creation
a
long
glutinous
extensible
tongue
hung
out
of
his
jaws
in
search
of
the
ants
which
formed
its
principal
food
it
is
an
echidna
said
paganel
have
you
ever
seen
such
a
creature
it
is
horrible
replied
glenarvan
horrible
enough
but
curious
and
what
s
more
peculiar
to
australia
one
might
search
for
it
in
vain
in
any
other
part
of
the
naturally
enough
the
geographer
wished
to
preserve
this
interesting
specimen
of
monotremata
and
wanted
to
stow
it
away
in
the
luggage
but
olbinett
resented
the
idea
so
indignantly
that
the
savant
was
obliged
to
abandon
his
project
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
john
mangles
descried
an
enormous
column
of
smoke
about
three
miles
off
gradually
overspreading
the
whole
horizon
what
could
be
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
paganel
was
inclined
to
think
it
was
some
description
of
meteor
and
his
lively
imagination
was
already
in
search
of
an
explanation
when
ayrton
cut
short
all
his
conjectures
summarily
by
announcing
that
the
cloud
of
dust
was
caused
by
a
drove
of
cattle
on
the
road
the
quartermaster
proved
right
for
as
the
cloud
came
nearer
quite
a
chorus
of
bleatings
and
neighings
and
escaped
from
it
mingled
with
the
loud
tones
of
a
human
voice
in
the
shape
of
cries
and
whistles
and
vociferations
presently
a
man
came
out
of
the
cloud
this
was
the
of
the
army
glenarvan
advanced
toward
him
and
friendly
relations
were
speedily
established
between
them
the
leader
or
to
give
him
his
proper
designation
the
was
part
owner
of
the
drove
his
name
was
sam
machell
and
he
was
on
his
way
from
the
eastern
provinces
to
portland
bay
the
drove
numbered
head
in
all
or
bullocks
sheep
and
horses
all
these
had
been
bought
in
the
blue
mountains
in
a
poor
lean
condition
and
were
going
to
be
fatted
up
on
the
rich
pasture
lands
of
southern
australia
and
sold
again
at
a
great
profit
sam
machell
expected
to
get
pounds
on
each
bullock
and
on
every
sheep
which
would
bring
him
in
pounds
this
was
doing
good
business
but
what
patience
and
energy
were
required
to
conduct
such
a
restive
stubborn
lot
to
their
destination
and
what
fatigues
must
have
to
be
endured
truly
the
gain
was
hardly
earned
sam
machell
told
his
history
in
a
few
words
while
the
drove
continued
their
march
among
the
groves
of
mimosas
lady
helena
and
mary
and
the
rest
of
the
party
seated
themselves
under
the
shade
of
a
and
listened
to
his
recital
it
was
seven
months
since
sam
machell
had
started
he
had
gone
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
a
day
and
his
interminable
journey
would
last
three
months
longer
his
assistants
in
the
laborious
task
comprised
twenty
dogs
and
thirty
men
five
of
whom
were
blacks
and
very
serviceable
in
tracking
up
any
strayed
beasts
six
wagons
made
the
all
the
men
were
armed
with
stockwhips
the
handles
of
which
are
eighteen
inches
long
and
the
lash
nine
feet
and
they
move
about
among
the
ranks
bringing
refractory
animals
back
into
order
while
the
dogs
the
light
cavalry
of
the
regiment
preserved
discipline
in
the
wings
the
travelers
were
struck
with
the
admirable
arrangement
of
the
drove
the
different
stock
were
kept
apart
for
wild
sheep
and
bullocks
would
not
have
got
on
together
at
all
the
bullocks
would
never
have
grazed
where
the
sheep
had
passed
along
and
consequently
they
had
to
go
first
divided
into
two
battalions
five
regiments
of
sheep
followed
in
charge
of
twenty
men
and
last
of
all
came
the
horses
sam
machell
drew
the
attention
of
his
auditors
to
the
fact
that
the
real
guides
of
the
drove
were
neither
the
men
nor
the
dogs
but
the
oxen
themselves
beasts
of
superior
intelligence
recognized
as
leaders
by
their
congenitors
they
advanced
in
front
with
perfect
gravity
choosing
the
best
route
by
instinct
and
fully
alive
to
their
claim
to
respect
indeed
they
were
obliged
to
be
studied
and
humored
in
everything
for
the
whole
drove
obeyed
them
implicitly
if
they
took
it
into
their
heads
to
stop
it
was
a
matter
of
necessity
to
yield
to
their
good
pleasure
for
not
a
single
animal
would
move
a
step
till
these
leaders
gave
the
signal
to
set
off
sundry
details
added
by
the
completed
the
history
of
this
expedition
worthy
of
being
written
if
not
commended
by
xenophon
himself
as
long
as
the
troop
marched
over
the
plains
it
was
well
enough
there
was
little
difficulty
or
fatigue
the
animals
fed
as
they
went
along
and
slaked
their
thirst
at
the
numerous
creeks
that
watered
the
plains
sleeping
at
night
and
making
good
progress
in
the
day
always
obedient
and
tractable
to
the
dogs
but
when
they
had
to
go
through
great
forests
and
groves
of
eucalyptus
and
mimosas
the
difficulties
increased
platoons
battalions
and
regiments
got
all
mixed
together
or
scattered
and
it
was
a
work
of
time
to
collect
them
again
should
a
leader
unfortunately
go
astray
he
had
to
be
found
cost
what
it
might
on
pain
of
a
general
disbandment
and
the
blacks
were
often
long
days
in
quest
of
him
before
their
search
was
successful
during
the
heavy
rains
the
lazy
beasts
refused
to
stir
and
when
violent
storms
chanced
to
occur
the
creatures
became
almost
mad
with
terror
and
were
seized
with
a
wild
disorderly
panic
however
by
dint
of
energy
and
ambition
the
triumphed
over
these
difficulties
incessantly
renewed
though
they
were
he
kept
steadily
on
mile
after
mile
of
plains
and
woods
and
mountains
lay
behind
but
in
addition
to
all
his
other
qualities
there
was
one
higher
than
all
that
he
specially
needed
when
they
came
to
rivers
this
was
patience
patience
that
could
stand
any
trial
and
not
only
could
hold
out
for
hours
and
days
but
for
weeks
the
would
be
himself
forced
to
wait
on
the
banks
of
a
stream
that
might
have
been
crossed
at
once
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
but
the
obstinacy
of
the
herd
the
bullocks
would
taste
the
water
and
turn
back
the
sheep
fled
in
all
directions
afraid
to
brave
the
liquid
element
the
hoped
when
night
came
he
might
manage
them
better
but
they
still
refused
to
go
forward
the
rams
were
dragged
in
by
force
but
the
sheep
would
not
follow
they
tried
what
thirst
would
do
by
keeping
them
without
drink
for
several
days
but
when
they
were
brought
to
the
river
again
they
simply
quenched
their
thirst
and
declined
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
water
the
next
expedient
employed
was
to
carry
all
the
lambs
over
hoping
the
mothers
would
be
drawn
after
them
moved
by
their
cries
but
the
lambs
might
bleat
as
pitifully
as
they
liked
the
mothers
never
stirred
sometimes
this
state
of
affairs
would
last
a
whole
month
and
the
would
be
driven
to
his
wits
end
by
his
bleating
bellowing
neighing
army
then
all
of
a
sudden
one
fine
day
without
rhyme
or
reason
a
detachment
would
take
it
into
their
heads
to
make
a
start
across
and
the
only
difficulty
now
was
to
keep
the
whole
herd
from
rushing
after
them
the
wildest
confusion
set
in
among
the
ranks
and
numbers
of
the
animals
were
drowned
in
the
passage
such
was
the
narrative
of
sam
machell
during
its
recital
a
considerable
part
of
the
troop
had
filed
past
in
good
order
it
was
time
for
him
to
return
to
his
place
at
their
head
that
he
might
be
able
to
choose
the
best
pasturage
taking
leave
of
lord
glenarvan
he
sprang
on
a
capital
horse
of
the
native
breed
that
one
of
his
men
held
waiting
for
him
and
after
shaking
hands
cordially
with
everybody
all
round
took
his
departure
a
few
minutes
later
nothing
was
visible
of
the
and
his
troop
but
a
cloud
of
dust
the
wagon
resumed
its
course
in
the
opposite
direction
and
did
not
stop
again
till
they
halted
for
the
night
at
the
foot
of
mount
talbot
paganel
made
the
judicious
observation
that
it
was
the
of
december
the
christmas
day
so
dear
to
english
hearts
but
the
steward
had
not
forgotten
it
and
an
appetizing
meal
was
soon
ready
under
the
tent
for
which
he
deserved
and
received
warm
compliments
from
the
guests
indeed
olbinett
had
quite
excelled
himself
on
this
occasion
he
produced
from
his
stores
such
an
array
of
european
dishes
as
is
seldom
seen
in
the
australian
desert
reindeer
hams
slices
of
salt
beef
smoked
salmon
oat
cakes
and
barley
meal
scones
tea
and
whisky
in
abundance
and
several
bottles
of
port
composed
this
astonishing
meal
the
little
party
might
have
thought
themselves
in
the
grand
of
malcolm
castle
in
the
heart
of
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
next
day
at
the
wagon
reached
the
banks
of
the
wimerra
on
the
meridian
the
river
half
a
mile
in
width
wound
its
limpid
course
between
tall
rows
of
and
acacias
magnificent
specimens
of
the
myrtacea
among
others
the
fifteen
feet
high
with
long
drooping
branches
adorned
with
red
flowers
thousands
of
birds
the
lories
and
greenfinches
and
pigeons
not
to
speak
of
the
noisy
paroquets
flew
about
in
the
green
branches
below
on
the
bosom
of
the
water
were
a
couple
of
shy
and
unapproachable
black
swans
this
of
the
australian
rivers
soon
disappeared
among
the
windings
of
the
wimerra
which
water
the
charming
landscape
in
the
most
capricious
manner
the
wagon
stopped
on
a
grassy
bank
the
long
fringes
of
which
dipped
in
the
rapid
current
there
was
neither
raft
nor
bridge
but
cross
over
they
must
ayrton
looked
about
for
a
practicable
ford
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
water
seemed
shallower
and
it
was
here
they
determined
to
try
to
pass
over
the
soundings
in
different
parts
showed
a
depth
of
three
feet
only
so
that
the
wagon
might
safely
enough
venture
i
suppose
there
is
no
other
way
of
fording
the
river
said
glenarvan
to
the
quartermaster
no
my
lord
but
the
passage
does
not
seem
dangerous
we
shall
manage
shall
lady
glenarvan
and
miss
grant
get
out
of
the
wagon
not
at
all
my
bullocks
are
surefooted
and
you
may
rely
on
me
for
keeping
them
very
well
ayrton
i
can
trust
the
horsemen
surrounded
the
ponderous
vehicle
and
all
stepped
boldly
into
the
current
generally
when
wagons
have
to
ford
rivers
they
have
empty
casks
slung
all
round
them
to
keep
them
floating
on
the
water
but
they
had
no
such
swimming
belt
with
them
on
this
occasion
and
they
could
only
depend
on
the
sagacity
of
the
animals
and
the
prudence
of
ayrton
who
directed
the
team
the
major
and
the
two
sailors
were
some
feet
in
advance
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
went
at
the
sides
of
the
wagon
ready
to
lend
any
assistance
the
fair
travelers
might
require
and
paganel
and
robert
brought
up
the
rear
all
went
well
till
they
reached
the
middle
of
the
wimerra
but
then
the
hollow
deepened
and
the
water
rose
to
the
middle
of
the
wheels
the
bullocks
were
in
danger
of
losing
their
footing
and
dragging
with
them
the
oscillating
vehicle
ayrton
devoted
himself
to
his
task
courageously
he
jumped
into
the
water
and
hanging
on
by
the
bullocks
horns
dragged
them
back
into
the
right
course
suddenly
the
wagon
made
a
jolt
that
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
a
crack
was
heard
and
the
vehicle
began
to
lean
over
in
a
most
precarious
manner
the
water
now
rose
to
the
ladies
feet
the
whole
concern
began
to
float
though
john
mangles
and
lord
glenarvan
hung
on
to
the
side
it
was
an
anxious
moment
fortunately
a
vigorous
effort
drove
the
wagon
toward
the
opposite
shore
and
the
bank
began
to
slope
upward
so
that
the
horses
and
bullocks
were
able
to
regain
their
footing
and
soon
the
whole
party
found
themselves
on
the
other
side
glad
enough
though
wet
enough
too
the
fore
part
of
the
wagon
however
was
broken
by
the
jolt
and
glenarvan
s
horse
had
lost
a
shoe
this
was
an
accident
that
needed
to
be
promptly
repaired
they
looked
at
each
other
hardly
knowing
what
to
do
till
ayrton
proposed
he
should
go
to
black
point
station
twenty
miles
further
north
and
bring
back
a
blacksmith
with
him
yes
go
my
good
fellow
said
glenarvan
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
get
there
and
back
about
fifteen
hours
replied
ayrton
but
not
start
at
once
then
and
we
will
camp
here
on
the
banks
of
the
wimerra
till
you
chapter
xi
crime
or
calamity
it
was
not
without
apprehension
that
the
major
saw
ayrton
quit
the
wimerra
camp
to
go
and
look
for
a
blacksmith
at
the
black
point
station
but
he
did
not
breathe
a
word
of
his
private
misgivings
and
contented
himself
with
watching
the
neighborhood
of
the
river
nothing
disturbed
the
repose
of
those
tranquil
glades
and
after
a
short
night
the
sun
reappeared
on
the
horizon
as
to
glenarvan
his
only
fear
was
lest
ayrton
should
return
alone
if
they
fail
to
find
a
workman
the
wagon
could
not
resume
the
journey
this
might
end
in
a
delay
of
many
days
and
glenarvan
impatient
to
succeed
could
brook
no
delay
in
his
eagerness
to
attain
his
object
ayrton
luckily
had
lost
neither
his
time
nor
his
trouble
he
appeared
next
morning
at
daybreak
accompanied
by
a
man
who
gave
himself
out
as
the
blacksmith
from
black
point
station
he
was
a
powerful
fellow
and
tall
but
his
features
were
of
a
low
brutal
type
which
did
not
prepossess
anyone
in
his
favor
but
that
was
nothing
provided
he
knew
his
business
he
scarcely
spoke
and
certainly
he
did
not
waste
his
breath
in
useless
words
is
he
a
good
workman
said
john
mangles
to
the
quartermaster
i
know
no
more
about
him
than
you
do
captain
said
ayrton
but
we
shall
the
blacksmith
set
to
work
evidently
that
was
his
trade
as
they
could
plainly
see
from
the
way
he
set
about
repairing
the
forepart
of
the
wagon
he
worked
skilfully
and
with
uncommon
energy
the
major
observed
that
the
flesh
of
his
wrists
was
deeply
furrowed
showing
a
ring
of
extravasated
blood
it
was
the
mark
of
a
recent
injury
which
the
sleeve
of
an
old
woolen
shirt
could
not
conceal
mcnabbs
questioned
the
blacksmith
about
those
sores
which
looked
so
painful
the
man
continued
his
work
without
answering
two
hours
more
and
the
damage
the
carriage
had
sustained
was
made
good
as
to
glenarvan
s
horse
it
was
soon
disposed
of
the
blacksmith
had
had
the
forethought
to
bring
the
shoes
with
him
these
shoes
had
a
peculiarity
which
did
not
escape
the
major
it
was
a
trefoil
clumsily
cut
on
the
back
part
mcnabbs
pointed
it
out
to
ayrton
it
is
the
brand
said
the
quartermaster
that
enables
them
to
track
any
horses
that
may
stray
from
the
station
and
prevents
their
being
mixed
with
other
the
horse
was
soon
shod
the
blacksmith
claimed
his
wage
and
went
off
without
uttering
four
words
half
an
hour
later
the
travelers
were
on
the
road
beyond
the
grove
of
mimosas
was
a
stretch
of
sparsely
timbered
country
which
quite
deserved
its
name
of
open
some
fragments
of
quartz
and
ferruginous
rock
lay
among
the
scrub
and
the
tall
grass
where
numerous
flocks
were
feeding
some
miles
farther
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
plowed
deep
into
the
alluvial
soil
where
irregular
creeks
murmured
in
their
beds
half
hidden
among
giant
reeds
they
skirted
vast
salt
lakes
rapidly
evaporating
the
journey
was
accomplished
without
trouble
and
indeed
without
fatigue
lady
helena
invited
the
horsemen
of
the
party
to
pay
her
a
visit
in
turns
as
her
was
but
small
and
in
pleasant
converse
with
this
amiable
woman
they
forgot
the
fatigue
of
their
day
s
ride
lady
helena
seconded
by
miss
mary
did
the
honors
of
their
ambulatory
house
with
perfect
grace
john
mangles
was
not
forgotten
in
these
daily
invitations
and
his
somewhat
serious
conversation
was
not
unpleasing
the
party
crossed
in
a
diagonal
direction
the
road
from
crowland
to
horsham
which
was
a
very
dusty
one
and
little
used
by
pedestrians
the
spurs
of
some
low
hills
were
skirted
at
the
boundary
of
talbot
county
and
in
the
evening
the
travelers
reached
a
point
about
three
miles
from
maryborough
the
fine
rain
was
falling
which
in
any
other
country
would
have
soaked
the
ground
but
here
the
air
absorbed
the
moisture
so
wonderfully
that
the
camp
did
not
suffer
in
the
least
next
day
the
of
december
the
march
was
delayed
somewhat
by
a
succession
of
little
hills
resembling
a
miniature
switzerland
it
was
a
constant
repetition
of
up
and
down
hill
and
many
a
jolt
besides
all
of
which
were
scarcely
pleasant
the
travelers
walked
part
of
the
way
and
thought
it
no
hardship
at
eleven
o
clock
they
arrived
at
carisbrook
rather
an
important
municipality
ayrton
was
for
passing
outside
the
town
without
going
through
it
in
order
he
said
to
save
time
glenarvan
concurred
with
him
but
paganel
always
eager
for
novelties
was
for
visiting
carisbrook
they
gave
him
his
way
and
the
wagon
went
on
slowly
paganel
as
was
his
custom
took
robert
with
him
his
visit
to
the
town
was
very
short
but
it
sufficed
to
give
him
an
exact
idea
of
australian
towns
there
was
a
bank
a
a
market
a
church
and
a
hundred
or
so
of
brick
houses
all
exactly
alike
the
whole
town
was
laid
out
in
squares
crossed
with
parallel
streets
in
the
english
fashion
nothing
could
be
more
simple
nothing
less
attractive
as
the
town
grows
they
lengthen
the
streets
as
we
lengthen
the
trousers
of
a
growing
child
and
thus
the
original
symmetry
is
undisturbed
carisbrook
was
full
of
activity
a
remarkable
feature
in
these
towns
of
yesterday
it
seems
in
australia
as
if
towns
shot
up
like
trees
owing
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
men
of
business
were
hurrying
along
the
streets
gold
buyers
were
hastening
to
meet
the
escort
the
precious
metal
guarded
by
the
local
police
was
coming
from
the
mines
at
bendigo
and
mount
alexander
all
the
little
world
was
so
absorbed
in
its
own
interests
that
the
strangers
passed
unobserved
amid
the
laborious
inhabitants
after
an
hour
devoted
to
visiting
carisbrook
the
two
visitors
rejoined
their
companions
and
crossed
a
highly
cultivated
district
long
stretches
of
prairie
known
as
the
low
level
plains
next
met
their
gaze
dotted
with
countless
sheep
and
shepherds
huts
and
then
came
a
sandy
tract
without
any
transition
but
with
the
abruptness
of
change
so
characteristic
of
australian
scenery
mount
simpson
and
mount
terrengower
marked
the
southern
point
where
the
boundary
of
the
loddon
district
cuts
the
meridian
as
yet
they
had
not
met
with
any
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
living
in
the
savage
state
glenarvan
wondered
if
the
australians
were
wanting
in
australia
as
the
indians
had
been
wanting
in
the
pampas
of
the
argentine
district
but
paganel
told
him
that
in
that
latitude
the
natives
frequented
chiefly
the
murray
plains
about
one
hundred
miles
to
the
eastward
we
are
now
approaching
the
gold
district
said
he
in
a
day
or
two
we
shall
cross
the
rich
region
of
mount
alexander
it
was
here
that
the
swarm
of
diggers
alighted
in
the
natives
had
to
fly
to
the
interior
we
are
in
civilized
districts
without
seeing
any
sign
of
it
but
our
road
will
before
the
day
is
over
cross
the
railway
which
connects
the
murray
with
the
sea
well
i
must
confess
a
railway
in
australia
does
seem
to
me
an
astonishing
thing
and
pray
why
paganel
said
glenarvan
why
because
it
jars
on
one
s
ideas
oh
i
know
you
english
are
so
used
to
colonizing
distant
possessions
you
who
have
electric
telegraphs
and
universal
exhibitions
in
new
zealand
you
think
it
is
all
quite
natural
but
it
the
mind
of
a
frenchman
like
myself
and
confuses
all
one
s
notions
of
australia
because
you
look
at
the
past
and
not
at
the
present
said
john
mangles
a
loud
whistle
interrupted
the
discussion
the
party
were
within
a
mile
of
the
railway
quite
a
number
of
persons
were
hastening
toward
the
railway
bridge
the
people
from
the
neighboring
stations
left
their
houses
and
the
shepherds
their
flocks
and
crowded
the
approaches
to
the
railway
every
now
and
then
there
was
a
shout
the
railway
the
railway
something
serious
must
have
occurred
to
produce
such
an
agitation
perhaps
some
terrible
accident
glenarvan
followed
by
the
rest
urged
on
his
horse
in
a
few
minutes
he
arrived
at
camden
bridge
and
then
he
became
aware
of
the
cause
of
such
an
excitement
a
fearful
accident
had
occurred
not
a
collision
but
a
train
had
gone
off
the
line
and
then
there
had
been
a
fall
the
affair
recalled
the
worst
disasters
of
american
railways
the
river
crossed
by
the
railway
was
full
of
broken
carriages
and
the
engine
whether
the
weight
of
the
train
had
been
too
much
for
the
bridge
or
whether
the
train
had
gone
off
the
rails
the
fact
remained
that
five
carriages
out
of
six
fell
into
the
bed
of
the
loddon
dragged
down
by
the
locomotive
the
sixth
carriage
miraculously
preserved
by
the
breaking
of
the
coupling
chain
remained
on
the
rails
six
feet
from
the
abyss
below
nothing
was
discernible
but
a
melancholy
heap
of
twisted
and
blackened
axles
shattered
wagons
bent
rails
charred
sleepers
the
boiler
burst
by
the
shock
had
scattered
its
plates
to
enormous
distances
from
this
shapeless
mass
of
ruins
flames
and
black
smoke
still
rose
after
the
fearful
fall
came
fire
more
fearful
still
great
tracks
of
blood
scattered
limbs
charred
trunks
of
bodies
showed
here
and
there
none
could
guess
how
many
victims
lay
dead
and
mangled
under
those
ruins
glenarvan
paganel
the
major
mangles
mixing
with
the
crowd
heard
the
current
talk
everyone
tried
to
account
for
the
accident
while
doing
his
utmost
to
save
what
could
be
saved
the
bridge
must
have
broken
said
one
not
a
bit
of
it
the
bridge
is
whole
enough
they
must
have
forgotten
to
close
it
to
let
the
train
pass
that
is
it
was
in
fact
a
swing
bridge
which
opened
for
the
convenience
of
the
boats
had
the
guard
by
an
unpardonable
oversight
omitted
to
close
it
for
the
passage
of
the
train
so
that
the
train
coming
on
at
full
speed
was
precipitated
into
the
loddon
this
hypothesis
seemed
very
admissible
for
although
of
the
bridge
lay
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
train
the
other
half
drawn
up
to
the
opposite
shore
hung
still
unharmed
by
its
chains
no
one
could
doubt
that
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
the
guard
had
caused
the
catastrophe
the
accident
had
occurred
in
the
night
to
the
express
train
which
left
melbourne
at
in
the
evening
about
a
quarter
past
three
in
the
morning
minutes
after
leaving
castlemaine
it
arrived
at
camden
bridge
where
the
terrible
disaster
befell
the
passengers
and
guards
of
the
last
and
only
remaining
carriage
at
once
tried
to
obtain
help
but
the
telegraph
whose
posts
were
lying
on
the
ground
could
not
be
worked
it
was
three
hours
before
the
authorities
from
castlemaine
reached
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
it
was
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
the
salvage
party
was
organized
under
the
direction
of
mitchell
the
of
the
colony
and
a
detachment
of
police
commanded
by
an
inspector
the
squatters
and
their
hands
lent
their
aid
and
directed
their
efforts
first
to
extinguishing
the
fire
which
raged
in
the
ruined
heap
with
unconquerable
violence
a
few
unrecognizable
bodies
lay
on
the
slope
of
the
embankment
but
from
that
blazing
mass
no
living
thing
could
be
saved
the
fire
had
done
its
work
too
speedily
of
the
passengers
ten
only
survived
those
in
the
last
carriage
the
railway
authorities
sent
a
locomotive
to
bring
them
back
to
castlemaine
lord
glenarvan
having
introduced
himself
to
the
entered
into
conversation
with
him
and
the
inspector
of
police
the
latter
was
a
tall
thin
man
cool
and
whatever
he
may
have
felt
allowed
no
trace
of
it
to
appear
on
his
features
he
contemplated
this
calamity
as
a
mathematician
does
a
problem
he
was
seeking
to
solve
it
and
to
find
the
unknown
and
when
glenarvan
observed
this
is
a
great
misfortune
he
quietly
replied
better
than
that
my
better
than
that
cried
glenarvan
i
do
not
understand
it
is
better
than
a
misfortune
it
is
a
crime
he
replied
in
the
same
quiet
tone
glenarvan
looked
inquiringly
at
mitchell
for
a
solution
yes
my
lord
replied
the
our
inquiries
have
resulted
in
the
conclusion
that
the
catastrophe
is
the
result
of
a
crime
the
last
has
been
robbed
the
surviving
passengers
were
attacked
by
a
gang
of
five
or
six
villains
the
bridge
was
intentionally
opened
and
not
left
open
by
the
negligence
of
the
guard
and
connecting
with
this
fact
the
guard
s
disappearance
we
may
conclude
that
the
wretched
fellow
was
an
accomplice
of
these
the
shook
his
head
at
this
inference
you
do
not
agree
with
me
said
mitchell
no
not
as
to
the
complicity
of
the
well
but
granting
that
complicity
we
may
attribute
the
crime
to
the
natives
who
haunt
the
murray
without
him
the
blacks
could
never
have
opened
a
they
know
nothing
of
its
exactly
so
said
the
well
added
mitchell
we
have
the
evidence
of
a
boatman
whose
boat
passed
camden
bridge
at
that
the
bridge
was
properly
shut
after
he
well
after
that
i
can
not
see
any
doubt
as
to
the
complicity
of
the
the
shook
his
head
gently
but
continuously
then
you
don
t
attribute
the
crime
to
the
natives
not
at
to
whom
then
just
at
this
moment
a
noise
was
heard
from
about
half
a
mile
up
the
river
a
crowd
had
gathered
and
quickly
increased
they
soon
reached
the
station
and
in
their
midst
were
two
men
carrying
a
corpse
it
was
the
body
of
the
guard
quite
cold
stabbed
to
the
heart
the
murderers
had
no
doubt
hoped
by
dragging
their
victim
to
a
distance
that
the
police
would
be
put
on
a
wrong
scent
in
their
first
inquiries
this
discovery
at
any
rate
justified
the
doubts
of
the
the
poor
blacks
had
had
no
hand
in
the
matter
those
who
dealt
that
blow
said
he
were
already
well
used
to
this
little
instrument
and
so
saying
he
produced
a
pair
of
darbies
a
kind
of
handcuff
made
of
a
double
ring
of
iron
secured
by
a
lock
i
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
them
with
these
bracelets
as
a
new
year
s
then
you
suspect
some
folks
who
came
out
free
in
her
majesty
s
what
convicts
cried
paganel
who
recognized
the
formula
employed
in
the
australian
colonies
i
thought
said
glenarvan
convicts
had
no
right
in
the
province
of
bah
said
the
inspector
if
they
have
no
right
they
take
it
they
escape
sometimes
and
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
this
lot
have
come
straight
from
perth
and
take
my
word
for
it
they
will
soon
be
there
mitchell
nodded
acquiescence
in
the
words
of
the
at
this
moment
the
wagon
arrived
at
the
level
crossing
of
the
railway
glenarvan
wished
to
spare
the
ladies
the
horrible
spectacle
at
camden
bridge
he
took
courteous
leave
of
the
and
made
a
sign
to
the
rest
to
follow
him
there
is
no
reason
said
he
for
delaying
our
when
they
reached
the
wagon
glenarvan
merely
mentioned
to
lady
helena
that
there
had
been
a
railway
accident
without
a
hint
of
the
crime
that
had
played
so
great
a
part
in
it
neither
did
he
make
mention
of
the
presence
of
a
band
of
convicts
in
the
neighborhood
reserving
that
piece
of
information
solely
for
ayrton
s
ear
the
little
procession
now
crossed
the
railway
some
two
hundred
yards
below
the
bridge
and
then
resumed
their
eastward
course
chapter
xii
toline
of
the
lachlan
about
two
miles
from
the
railway
the
plain
terminated
in
a
range
of
low
hills
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
wagon
entered
a
succession
of
narrow
gorges
and
capricious
windings
out
of
which
it
emerged
into
a
most
charming
region
where
grand
trees
not
closely
planted
but
in
scattered
groups
were
growing
with
absolutely
tropical
luxuriance
as
the
party
drove
on
they
stumbled
upon
a
little
native
boy
lying
fast
asleep
beneath
the
shade
of
a
magnificent
banksia
he
was
dressed
in
european
garb
and
seemed
about
eight
years
of
age
there
was
no
mistaking
the
characteristic
features
of
his
race
the
crisped
hair
the
nearly
black
skin
the
flattened
nose
the
thick
lips
the
unusual
length
of
the
arms
immediately
classed
him
among
the
aborigines
of
the
interior
but
a
degree
of
intelligence
appeared
in
his
face
that
showed
some
educational
influences
must
have
been
at
work
on
his
savage
untamed
nature
lady
helena
whose
interest
was
greatly
excited
by
this
spectacle
got
out
of
the
wagon
followed
by
mary
and
presently
the
whole
company
surrounded
the
peaceful
little
sleeper
poor
child
said
mary
grant
is
he
lost
i
wonder
in
this
desert
i
suppose
said
lady
helena
he
has
come
a
long
way
to
visit
this
part
no
doubt
some
he
loves
are
but
he
can
t
be
left
here
added
robert
we
must
his
compassionate
sentence
remained
unfinished
for
just
at
that
moment
the
child
turned
over
in
his
sleep
and
to
the
extreme
surprise
of
everybody
there
was
a
large
label
on
his
shoulders
on
which
the
following
was
written
toline
to
be
conducted
to
echuca
care
of
jeffries
smith
railway
porter
prepaid
that
s
the
english
all
over
exclaimed
paganel
they
send
off
a
child
just
as
they
would
luggage
and
book
him
like
a
parcel
i
heard
it
was
done
certainly
but
i
could
not
believe
it
poor
child
said
lady
helena
could
he
have
been
in
the
train
that
got
off
the
line
at
camden
bridge
perhaps
his
parents
are
killed
and
he
is
left
alone
in
the
world
i
don
t
think
so
madam
replied
john
mangles
that
card
rather
goes
to
prove
he
was
traveling
he
is
waking
up
said
mary
and
so
he
was
his
eyes
slowly
opened
and
then
closed
again
pained
by
the
glare
of
light
but
lady
helena
took
his
hand
and
he
jumped
up
at
once
and
looked
about
him
in
bewilderment
at
the
sight
of
so
many
strangers
he
seemed
half
frightened
at
first
but
the
presence
of
lady
helena
reassured
him
do
you
understand
english
my
little
man
asked
the
young
lady
i
understand
it
and
speak
it
replied
the
child
in
fluent
enough
english
but
with
a
marked
accent
his
pronunciation
was
like
a
frenchman
s
what
is
your
name
asked
lady
helena
toline
replied
the
little
native
toline
exclaimed
paganel
ah
i
think
that
means
bark
of
a
tree
in
toline
nodded
and
looked
again
at
the
travelers
where
do
you
come
from
inquired
lady
helena
from
melbourne
by
the
railway
from
were
you
in
the
accident
at
camden
bridge
said
glenarvan
yes
sir
was
toline
s
reply
but
the
god
of
the
bible
protected
are
you
traveling
alone
yes
alone
the
reverend
paxton
put
me
in
charge
of
jeffries
smith
but
unfortunately
the
poor
man
was
and
you
did
not
know
any
one
else
on
the
train
no
one
madam
but
god
watches
over
children
and
never
forsakes
toline
said
this
in
soft
quiet
tones
which
went
to
the
heart
when
he
mentioned
the
name
of
god
his
voice
was
grave
and
his
eyes
beamed
with
all
the
fervor
that
animated
his
young
soul
this
religious
enthusiasm
at
so
tender
an
age
was
easily
explained
the
child
was
one
of
the
aborigines
baptized
by
the
english
missionaries
and
trained
by
them
in
all
the
rigid
principles
of
the
methodist
church
his
calm
replies
proper
behavior
and
even
his
somber
garb
made
him
look
like
a
little
reverend
already
but
where
was
he
going
all
alone
in
these
solitudes
and
why
had
he
left
camden
bridge
lady
helena
asked
him
about
this
i
was
returning
to
my
tribe
in
the
lachlan
he
replied
i
wished
to
see
my
family
are
they
australians
inquired
john
mangles
yes
australians
of
the
lachlan
replied
toline
have
you
a
father
and
mother
said
robert
grant
yes
my
brother
replied
toline
holding
out
his
hand
to
little
grant
robert
was
so
touched
by
the
word
brother
that
he
kissed
the
black
child
and
they
were
friends
forthwith
the
whole
party
were
so
interested
in
these
replies
of
the
little
australian
savage
that
they
all
sat
round
him
in
a
listening
group
but
the
sun
had
meantime
sunk
behind
the
tall
trees
and
as
a
few
miles
would
not
greatly
retard
their
progress
and
the
spot
they
were
in
would
be
suitable
for
a
halt
glenarvan
gave
orders
to
prepare
their
camp
for
the
night
at
once
ayrton
unfastened
the
bullocks
and
turned
them
out
to
feed
at
will
the
tent
was
pitched
and
olbinett
got
the
supper
ready
toline
consented
after
some
difficulty
to
share
it
though
he
was
hungry
enough
he
took
his
seat
beside
robert
who
chose
out
all
the
titbits
for
his
new
friend
toline
accepted
them
with
a
shy
grace
that
was
very
charming
the
conversation
with
him
however
was
still
kept
up
for
everyone
felt
an
interest
in
the
child
and
wanted
to
talk
to
him
and
hear
his
history
it
was
simple
enough
he
was
one
of
the
poor
native
children
confided
to
the
care
of
charitable
societies
by
the
neighboring
tribes
the
australian
aborigines
are
gentle
and
inoffensive
never
exhibiting
the
fierce
hatred
toward
their
conquerors
which
characterizes
the
new
zealanders
and
possibly
a
few
of
the
races
of
northern
australia
they
often
go
to
the
large
towns
such
as
adelaide
sydney
and
melbourne
and
walk
about
in
very
primitive
costume
they
go
to
barter
their
few
articles
of
industry
hunting
and
fishing
implements
weapons
and
some
of
the
chiefs
from
pecuniary
motives
no
doubt
willingly
leave
their
children
to
profit
by
the
advantages
of
a
gratuitous
education
in
english
this
was
how
toline
s
parents
had
acted
they
were
true
australian
savages
living
in
the
lachlan
a
vast
region
lying
beyond
the
murray
the
child
had
been
in
melbourne
five
years
and
during
that
time
had
never
once
seen
any
of
his
own
people
and
yet
the
imperishable
feeling
of
kindred
was
still
so
strong
in
his
heart
that
he
had
dared
to
brave
this
journey
over
the
wilds
to
visit
his
tribe
once
more
scattered
though
perchance
it
might
be
and
his
family
even
should
he
find
it
decimated
and
after
you
have
kissed
your
parents
are
you
coming
back
to
melbourne
asked
lady
glenarvan
yes
madam
replied
toline
looking
at
the
lady
with
a
loving
expression
and
what
are
you
going
to
be
some
day
she
continued
i
am
going
to
snatch
my
brothers
from
misery
and
ignorance
i
am
going
to
teach
them
to
bring
them
to
know
and
love
god
i
am
going
to
be
a
words
like
those
spoken
with
such
animation
from
a
child
of
only
eight
years
might
have
provoked
a
smile
in
light
scoffing
auditors
but
they
were
understood
and
appreciated
by
the
grave
scotch
who
admired
the
courage
of
this
young
disciple
already
armed
for
the
battle
even
paganel
was
stirred
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
and
felt
his
warmer
sympathy
awakened
for
the
poor
child
to
speak
the
truth
up
to
that
moment
he
did
not
care
much
for
a
savage
in
european
attire
he
had
not
come
to
australia
to
see
australians
in
coats
and
trousers
he
preferred
them
simply
tattooed
and
this
conventional
dress
jarred
on
his
preconceived
notions
but
the
child
s
genuine
religious
fervor
won
him
over
completely
indeed
the
of
the
conversation
converted
the
worthy
geographer
into
his
best
friend
it
was
in
reply
to
a
question
lady
helena
had
asked
that
toline
said
he
was
studying
at
the
normal
school
in
melbourne
and
that
the
principal
was
the
reverend
paxton
and
what
do
they
teach
you
she
went
on
to
say
they
teach
me
the
bible
and
mathematics
and
paganel
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
and
said
indeed
geography
yes
sir
said
toline
and
i
had
the
first
prize
for
geography
before
the
christmas
you
had
the
first
prize
for
geography
my
boy
yes
sir
here
it
is
returned
toline
pulling
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
it
was
a
bible
size
and
well
bound
on
the
first
page
was
written
the
words
normal
school
melbourne
first
prize
for
geography
toline
of
the
paganel
was
beside
himself
an
australian
well
versed
in
geography
this
was
marvelous
and
he
could
not
help
kissing
toline
on
both
cheeks
just
as
if
he
had
been
the
reverend
paxton
himself
on
the
day
of
the
distribution
of
prizes
paganel
need
not
have
been
so
amazed
at
this
circumstance
however
for
it
is
frequent
enough
in
australian
schools
the
little
savages
are
very
quick
in
learning
geography
they
learn
it
eagerly
and
on
the
other
hand
are
perfectly
averse
to
the
science
of
arithmetic
toline
could
not
understand
this
outburst
of
affection
on
the
part
of
the
frenchman
and
looked
so
puzzled
that
lady
helena
thought
she
had
better
inform
him
that
paganel
was
a
celebrated
geographer
and
a
distinguished
professor
on
occasion
a
professor
of
geography
cried
toline
oh
sir
do
question
me
question
you
well
i
d
like
nothing
better
indeed
i
was
going
to
do
it
without
your
leave
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
how
they
teach
geography
in
the
normal
school
of
and
suppose
toline
trips
you
up
paganel
said
mcnabbs
what
a
likely
idea
exclaimed
the
geographer
trip
up
the
secretary
of
the
geographical
society
of
their
examination
then
commenced
after
paganel
had
settled
his
spectacles
firmly
on
his
nose
drawn
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
put
on
a
solemn
voice
becoming
to
a
professor
pupil
toline
stand
as
toline
was
already
standing
he
could
not
get
any
higher
but
he
waited
modestly
for
the
geographer
s
questions
pupil
toline
what
are
the
five
divisions
of
the
globe
oceanica
asia
africa
america
and
perfectly
so
now
we
ll
take
oceanica
first
where
are
we
at
this
moment
what
are
the
principal
divisions
australia
belonging
to
the
english
new
zealand
belonging
to
the
english
tasmania
belonging
to
the
english
the
islands
of
chatham
auckland
macquarie
kermadec
makin
maraki
are
also
belonging
to
the
very
good
and
new
caledonia
the
sandwich
islands
the
mendana
the
pomotou
they
are
islands
under
the
protectorate
of
great
what
cried
paganel
under
the
protectorate
of
great
britain
i
rather
think
on
the
contrary
that
france
france
said
the
child
with
an
astonished
look
well
well
said
paganel
is
that
what
they
teach
you
in
the
melbourne
normal
school
yes
sir
isn
t
it
right
oh
yes
yes
perfectly
right
all
oceanica
belongs
to
the
english
that
s
an
understood
thing
go
paganel
s
face
betrayed
both
surprise
and
annoyance
to
the
great
delight
of
the
major
let
us
go
on
to
asia
said
the
geographer
asia
replied
toline
is
an
immense
country
capital
calcutta
chief
towns
bombay
madras
calicut
aden
malacca
singapore
pegu
colombo
the
islands
the
maldives
the

belonging
to
the
very
good
pupil
toline
and
now
for
africa
comprises
two
chief
colonies
the
cape
on
the
south
capital
capetown
and
on
the
west
the
english
settlements
chief
city
sierra
capital
said
paganel
beginning
to
enter
into
this
perfectly
taught
but
fanciful
geography
as
to
algeria
morocco
egypt
they
are
all
struck
out
of
the
britannic
let
us
pass
on
pray
to
it
is
divided
said
toline
promptly
into
north
and
south
america
the
former
belongs
to
the
english
in
canada
new
brunswick
new
scotland
and
the
united
states
under
the
government
of
president
president
johnson
cried
paganel
the
successor
of
the
great
and
good
lincoln
assassinated
by
a
mad
fanatic
of
the
slave
party
capital
nothing
could
be
better
and
as
to
south
america
with
its
guiana
its
archipelago
of
south
shetland
its
georgia
jamaica
trinidad
that
belongs
to
the
english
too
well
i
ll
not
be
the
one
to
dispute
that
point
but
toline
i
should
like
to
know
your
opinion
of
europe
or
rather
your
professor
europe
said
toline
not
at
all
understanding
paganel
s
excitement
yes
europe
who
does
europe
belong
to
why
to
the
english
replied
toline
as
if
the
fact
was
quite
settled
i
much
doubt
it
returned
paganel
but
how
s
that
toline
for
i
want
to
know
that
england
ireland
scotland
malta
jersey
and
the
ionian
islands
the
hebrides
the
shetlands
and
the
yes
yes
my
lad
but
there
are
other
states
you
forgot
to
what
are
they
replied
the
child
not
the
least
disconcerted
spain
russia
austria
prussia
france
answered
paganel
they
are
provinces
not
states
said
toline
well
that
beats
all
exclaimed
paganel
tearing
off
his
spectacles
yes
continued
the
child
spain
capital
admirable
perfect
sublime
and
france
for
i
am
french
and
i
should
like
to
know
to
whom
i
france
said
toline
quietly
is
an
english
province
chief
city
calais
cried
paganel
so
you
think
calais
still
belongs
to
the
english
and
that
it
is
the
capital
of
france
yes
sir
and
it
is
there
that
the
governor
lord
this
was
too
much
for
paganel
s
risible
faculties
he
burst
out
laughing
toline
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
him
he
had
done
his
best
to
answer
every
question
put
to
him
but
the
singularity
of
the
answers
were
not
his
blame
indeed
he
never
imagined
anything
singular
about
them
however
he
took
it
all
quietly
and
waited
for
the
professor
to
recover
himself
these
peals
of
laughter
were
quite
incomprehensible
to
him
you
see
said
major
mcnabbs
laughing
i
was
right
the
pupil
could
enlighten
you
after
most
assuredly
friend
major
replied
the
geographer
so
that
s
the
way
they
teach
geography
in
melbourne
they
do
it
well
these
professors
in
the
normal
school
europe
asia
africa
america
oceanica
the
whole
world
belongs
to
the
english
my
conscience
with
such
an
ingenious
education
it
is
no
wonder
the
natives
submit
ah
well
toline
my
boy
does
the
moon
belong
to
england
too
she
will
some
day
replied
the
young
savage
gravely
this
was
the
climax
paganel
could
not
stand
any
more
he
was
obliged
to
go
away
and
take
his
laugh
out
for
he
was
actually
exploding
with
mirth
and
he
went
fully
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
encampment
before
his
equilibrium
was
restored
meanwhile
glenarvan
looked
up
a
geography
they
had
brought
among
their
books
it
was
richardson
s
compendium
a
work
in
great
repute
in
england
and
more
in
agreement
with
modern
science
than
the
manual
in
use
in
the
normal
school
in
melbourne
here
my
child
he
said
to
toline
take
this
book
and
keep
it
you
have
a
few
wrong
ideas
about
geography
which
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
rectify
i
will
give
you
this
as
a
keepsake
from
toline
took
the
book
silently
but
after
examining
it
attentively
he
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
incredulity
and
could
not
even
make
up
his
mind
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
by
this
time
night
had
closed
in
it
was
and
time
to
think
of
rest
if
they
were
to
start
betimes
next
day
robert
offered
his
friend
toline
half
his
bed
and
the
little
fellow
accepted
it
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
withdrew
to
the
wagon
and
the
others
lay
down
in
the
tent
paganel
s
merry
peals
still
mingling
with
the
low
sweet
song
of
the
wild
magpie
but
in
the
morning
at
six
o
clock
when
the
sunshine
wakened
the
sleepers
they
looked
in
vain
for
the
little
australian
toline
had
disappeared
was
he
in
haste
to
get
to
the
lachlan
district
or
was
he
hurt
by
paganel
s
laughter
no
one
could
say
but
when
lady
helena
opened
her
eyes
she
discovered
a
fresh
branch
of
mimosa
leaves
lying
across
her
and
paganel
found
a
book
in
his
vest
pocket
which
turned
out
to
be
richardson
s
chapter
xiii
a
warning
on
the
of
january
at
sunrise
the
travelers
forded
the
colban
and
the
caupespe
rivers
the
half
of
their
journey
was
now
accomplished
in
fifteen
days
more
should
their
journey
continue
to
be
prosperous
the
little
party
would
reach
twofold
bay
they
were
all
in
good
health
all
that
paganel
said
of
the
hygienic
qualities
of
the
climate
was
realized
there
was
little
or
no
humidity
and
the
heat
was
quite
bearable
neither
horses
nor
bullocks
could
complain
of
it
any
more
than
human
beings
the
order
of
the
march
had
been
changed
in
one
respect
since
the
affair
of
camden
bridge
that
criminal
catastrophe
on
the
railway
made
ayrton
take
sundry
precautions
which
had
hitherto
been
unnecessary
the
hunters
never
lost
sight
of
the
wagon
and
whenever
they
camped
one
was
always
placed
on
watch
morning
and
evening
the
firearms
were
primed
afresh
it
was
certain
that
a
gang
of
ruffians
was
prowling
about
the
country
and
though
there
was
no
cause
for
actual
fear
it
was
well
to
be
ready
for
whatever
might
happen
it
need
hardly
be
said
these
precautions
were
adopted
without
the
knowledge
of
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
as
lord
glenarvan
did
not
wish
to
alarm
them
they
were
by
no
means
unnecessary
however
for
any
imprudence
or
carelessness
might
have
cost
the
travelers
dear
others
beside
glenarvan
were
on
their
guard
in
lonely
settlements
and
on
stations
the
inhabitants
and
the
squatters
prepared
carefully
against
any
attack
or
surprise
houses
are
closed
at
nightfall
the
dogs
let
loose
inside
the
fences
barked
at
the
slightest
sound
not
a
single
shepherd
on
horseback
gathered
his
numerous
flocks
together
at
close
of
day
without
having
a
carbine
slung
from
his
saddle
the
outrage
at
camden
bridge
was
the
reason
for
all
this
and
many
a
colonist
fastened
himself
in
with
bolts
and
bars
now
at
dusk
who
used
to
sleep
with
open
doors
and
windows
the
government
itself
displayed
zeal
and
prudence
especially
in
the
department
on
this
very
day
just
as
glenarvan
and
his
party
were
on
their
way
from
kilmore
to
heathcote
the
mail
dashed
by
at
full
speed
but
though
the
horses
were
at
a
gallop
glenarvan
caught
sight
of
the
glittering
weapons
of
the
mounted
police
that
rode
by
its
side
as
they
swept
past
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
travelers
might
have
fancied
themselves
back
in
those
lawless
times
when
the
discovery
of
the
first
deluged
the
australian
continent
with
the
scum
of
europe
a
mile
beyond
the
road
to
kilmore
the
wagon
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
cape
bernouilli
struck
into
one
of
those
forests
of
gigantic
trees
which
extend
over
a
of
several
degrees
a
cry
of
admiration
escaped
the
travelers
at
the
sight
of
the
eucalyptus
trees
two
hundred
feet
high
with
tough
bark
five
inches
thick
the
trunks
measuring
twenty
feet
round
and
furrowed
with
foamy
streaks
of
an
odorous
resin
rose
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
the
soil
not
a
branch
not
a
twig
not
a
stray
shoot
not
even
a
knot
spoilt
the
regularity
of
their
outline
they
could
not
have
come
out
smoother
from
the
hands
of
a
turner
they
stood
like
pillars
all
molded
exactly
alike
and
could
be
counted
by
hundreds
at
an
enormous
height
they
spread
out
in
chaplets
of
branches
rounded
and
adorned
at
their
extremity
with
alternate
leaves
at
the
axle
of
these
leaves
solitary
flowers
drooped
down
the
calyx
of
which
resembles
an
inverted
urn
under
this
leafy
dome
which
never
lost
its
greenness
the
air
circulated
freely
and
dried
up
the
dampness
of
the
ground
horses
cattle
and
wagon
could
easily
pass
between
the
trees
for
they
were
standing
in
wide
rows
and
parceled
out
like
a
wood
that
was
being
felled
this
was
neither
like
the
woods
choked
up
with
brambles
nor
the
virgin
forest
barricaded
with
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
and
overgrown
with
inextricable
tangles
of
creepers
where
only
iron
and
fire
could
open
up
a
track
a
grassy
carpet
at
the
foot
of
the
trees
and
a
canopy
of
verdure
above
long
perspectives
of
bold
colors
little
shade
little
freshness
at
all
a
peculiar
light
as
if
the
rays
came
through
a
thin
veil
dappled
lights
and
shades
sharply
reflected
on
the
ground
made
up
a
whole
and
constituted
a
peculiar
spectacle
rich
in
novel
effects
the
forests
of
the
oceanic
continent
do
not
in
the
least
resemble
the
forests
of
the
new
world
and
the
eucalyptus
the
tara
of
the
aborigines
belonging
to
the
family
of
myrtacea
the
different
varieties
of
which
can
hardly
be
enumerated
is
the
tree
of
the
australian
flora
the
reason
of
the
shade
not
being
deep
nor
the
darkness
profound
under
these
domes
of
verdure
was
that
these
trees
presented
a
curious
anomaly
in
the
disposition
of
the
leaves
instead
of
presenting
their
broad
surface
to
the
sunlight
only
the
side
is
turned
only
the
profile
of
the
leaves
is
seen
in
this
singular
foliage
consequently
the
sun
s
rays
slant
down
them
to
the
earth
as
if
through
the
open
slants
of
a
venetian
blind
glenarvan
expressed
his
surprise
at
this
circumstance
and
wondered
what
could
be
the
cause
of
it
paganel
who
was
never
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
immediately
replied
what
astonishes
me
is
not
the
caprice
of
nature
she
knows
what
she
is
about
but
botanists
don
t
always
know
what
they
are
saying
nature
made
no
mistake
in
giving
this
peculiar
foliage
to
the
tree
but
men
have
erred
in
calling
them
what
does
the
word
mean
asked
mary
grant
it
comes
from
a
greek
word
meaning
i
they
took
care
to
commit
the
mistake
in
greek
that
it
might
not
be
so
for
anyone
can
see
that
the
ecualyptus
covers
i
agree
with
you
there
said
glenarvan
but
now
tell
us
paganel
how
it
is
that
the
leaves
grow
in
this
fashion
from
a
purely
physical
cause
friends
said
paganel
and
one
that
you
will
easily
understand
in
this
country
where
the
air
is
dry
and
rain
seldom
falls
and
the
ground
is
parched
the
trees
have
no
need
of
wind
or
sun
moisture
lacking
sap
is
lacking
also
hence
these
narrow
leaves
which
seek
to
defend
themselves
against
the
light
and
prevent
too
great
evaporation
this
is
why
they
present
the
profile
and
not
the
face
to
the
sun
s
rays
there
is
nothing
more
intelligent
than
a
and
nothing
more
selfish
added
the
major
these
only
thought
of
themselves
and
not
at
all
of
everyone
inclined
to
the
opinion
of
mcnabbs
except
paganel
who
congratulated
himself
on
walking
under
shadeless
trees
though
all
the
time
he
was
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
however
this
disposition
of
foliage
was
certainly
to
be
regretted
for
the
journey
through
the
forest
was
often
long
and
painful
as
the
traveler
had
no
protection
whatever
against
the
sun
s
fierce
rays
the
whole
of
this
day
the
wagon
continued
to
roll
along
through
interminable
rows
of
eucalyptus
without
meeting
either
quadruped
or
native
a
few
cockatoos
lived
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
but
at
such
a
height
they
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
and
their
noisy
chatter
was
changed
into
an
imperceptible
murmur
occasionally
a
swarm
of
flew
along
a
distant
path
and
lighted
it
up
for
an
instant
with
gay
colors
but
otherwise
solemn
silence
reigned
in
this
vast
green
temple
and
the
tramp
of
the
horses
a
few
words
exchanged
with
each
other
by
the
riders
the
grinding
noise
of
the
wheels
and
from
time
to
time
a
cry
from
ayrton
to
stir
up
his
lazy
team
were
the
only
sounds
which
disturbed
this
immense
solitude
when
night
came
they
camped
at
the
foot
of
some
eucalyptus
which
bore
marks
of
a
comparatively
recent
fire
they
looked
like
tall
factory
chimneys
for
the
flame
had
completely
hollowed
them
out
their
whole
length
with
the
thick
bark
still
covering
them
they
looked
none
the
worse
however
this
bad
habit
of
squatters
or
natives
will
end
in
the
destruction
of
these
magnificent
trees
and
they
will
disappear
like
the
cedars
of
lebanon
those
world
monuments
burnt
by
unlucky
camp
fires
olbinett
acting
on
paganel
s
advice
lighted
his
fire
to
prepare
supper
in
one
of
these
tubular
trunks
he
found
it
drew
capitally
and
the
smoke
was
lost
in
the
dark
foliage
above
the
requisite
precautions
were
taken
for
the
night
and
ayrton
mulrady
wilson
and
john
mangles
undertook
in
turn
to
keep
watch
until
sunrise
on
the
of
january
all
day
long
they
came
to
nothing
but
the
same
symmetrical
avenues
of
trees
it
seemed
as
if
they
never
were
going
to
end
however
toward
evening
the
ranks
of
trees
began
to
thin
and
on
a
little
plain
a
few
miles
off
an
assemblage
of
regular
houses
seymour
cried
paganel
that
is
the
last
town
we
come
to
in
the
province
of
is
it
an
important
one
asked
lady
helena
it
is
a
mere
village
madam
but
on
the
way
to
become
a
shall
we
find
a
respectable
hotel
there
asked
glenarvan
i
hope
so
replied
paganel
very
well
let
us
get
on
to
the
town
for
our
fair
travelers
with
all
their
courage
will
not
be
sorry
i
fancy
to
have
a
good
night
s
my
dear
edward
mary
and
i
will
accept
it
gladly
but
only
on
the
condition
that
it
will
cause
no
delay
or
take
us
the
least
out
of
the
it
will
do
neither
replied
lord
glenarvan
besides
our
bullocks
are
fatigued
and
we
will
start
at
it
was
now
nine
o
clock
the
moon
was
just
beginning
to
rise
but
her
rays
were
only
slanting
yet
and
lost
in
the
mist
it
was
gradually
getting
dark
when
the
little
party
entered
the
wide
streets
of
seymour
under
paganel
s
guidance
who
seemed
always
to
know
what
he
had
never
seen
but
his
instinct
led
him
right
and
he
walked
straight
to
campbell
s
north
british
hotel
the
major
without
even
leaving
the
hotel
was
soon
aware
that
fear
absorbed
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
town
ten
minutes
conversation
with
dickson
the
loquacious
landlord
made
him
completely
acquainted
with
the
actual
state
of
affairs
but
he
never
breathed
a
word
to
any
one
when
supper
was
over
though
and
lady
glenarvan
and
mary
and
robert
had
retired
the
major
detained
his
companions
a
little
and
said
they
have
found
out
the
perpetrators
of
the
crime
on
the
sandhurst
and
are
they
arrested
asked
ayrton
eagerly
no
replied
mcnabbs
without
apparently
noticing
the
empressment
of
the
quartermaster
an
empressment
which
moreover
was
reasonable
enough
under
the
circumstances
so
much
the
worse
replied
ayrton
well
said
glenarvan
who
are
the
authors
of
the
crime
read
replied
the
major
offering
glenarvan
a
copy
of
the
and
new
zealand
and
you
will
see
that
the
inspector
of
the
police
was
not
glenarvan
read
aloud
the
following
message
sydney
it
will
be
remembered
that
on
the
night
of
the
or
of
last
december
there
was
an
accident
at
camden
bridge
five
miles
beyond
the
station
at
castlemaine
on
the
railway
from
melbourne
to
sandhurst
the
night
express
dashing
along
at
full
speed
was
precipitated
into
the
loddon
river
camden
bridge
had
been
left
open
the
numerous
robberies
committed
after
the
accident
the
body
of
the
guard
picked
up
about
half
a
mile
from
camden
bridge
proved
that
this
catastrophe
was
the
result
of
a
crime
indeed
the
coroner
s
inquest
decided
that
the
crime
must
be
attributed
to
the
band
of
convicts
which
escaped
six
months
ago
from
the
penitentiary
at
perth
western
australia
just
as
they
were
about
to
be
transferred
to
norfolk
island
the
gang
numbers
men
they
are
under
the
command
of
a
certain
ben
joyce
a
criminal
of
the
most
dangerous
class
who
arrived
in
australia
a
few
months
ago
by
what
ship
is
not
known
and
who
has
hitherto
succeeded
in
evading
the
hands
of
justice
the
inhabitants
of

colonists
and
squatters
at
stations
are
hereby
cautioned
to
be
on
their
guard
and
to
communicate
to
the
any
information
that
may
aid
his
search
mitchell
when
glenarvan
had
finished
reading
this
article
mcnabbs
turned
to
the
geographer
and
said
you
see
paganel
there
can
be
convicts
in
escaped
convicts
that
is
evident
replied
paganel
but
not
regularly
transported
criminals
those
fellows
have
no
business
well
they
are
here
at
any
rate
said
glenarvan
but
i
don
t
suppose
the
fact
need
materially
alter
our
arrangements
what
do
you
think
john
john
mangles
did
not
reply
immediately
he
hesitated
between
the
sorrow
it
would
cause
the
two
children
to
give
up
the
search
and
the
fear
of
compromising
the
expedition
if
lady
glenarvan
and
miss
grant
were
not
with
us
he
said
i
should
not
give
myself
much
concern
about
these
glenarvan
understood
him
and
added
of
course
i
need
not
say
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
giving
up
our
task
but
would
it
perhaps
be
prudent
for
the
sake
of
our
companions
to
rejoin
the
duncan
at
melbourne
and
proceed
with
our
search
for
traces
of
harry
grant
on
the
eastern
side
what
do
you
think
of
it
mcnabbs
before
i
give
my
opinion
replied
the
major
i
should
like
to
hear
ayrton
at
this
direct
appeal
the
quartermaster
looked
at
glenarvan
and
said
i
think
we
are
two
hundred
miles
from
melbourne
and
that
the
danger
if
it
exists
is
as
great
on
the
route
to
the
south
as
on
the
route
to
the
east
both
are
little
frequented
and
both
will
serve
us
besides
i
do
not
think
that
thirty
scoundrels
can
frighten
eight
determined
men
my
advice
then
is
to
go
and
good
advice
too
ayrton
replied
paganel
by
going
on
we
may
come
across
the
traces
of
captain
grant
in
returning
south
on
the
contrary
we
turn
our
backs
to
them
i
think
with
you
then
and
i
don
t
care
a
snap
for
these
escaped
fellows
a
brave
man
wouldn
t
care
a
bit
for
them
upon
this
they
agreed
with
the
one
voice
to
follow
their
original
programme
just
one
thing
my
lord
said
ayrton
when
they
were
about
to
separate
say
on
wouldn
t
it
be
advisable
to
send
orders
to
the
duncan
to
be
at
the
coast
what
good
would
that
be
replied
john
mangles
when
we
reach
twofold
bay
it
will
be
time
enough
for
that
if
any
unexpected
event
should
oblige
us
to
go
to
melbourne
we
might
be
sorry
not
to
find
the
duncan
there
besides
her
injuries
can
not
be
repaired
yet
for
these
reasons
then
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
all
right
said
ayrton
and
forbore
to

matter

chapter

wealth
in
the
wilderness
on
january
at
after
a
tranquil
night
passed
in
longitude
degrees
the
travelers
continued
their
journey
across
the
vast
district
they
directed
their
course
steadily
toward
the
rising
sun
and
made
a
straight
line
across
the
plain
twice
over
they
came
upon
the
traces
of
squatters
going
toward
the
north
and
their
different
footprints
became
confused
and
glenarvan
s
horse
no
longer
left
on
the
dust
the
blackpoint
mark
recognizable
by
its
double
shamrock
the
plain
was
furrowed
in
some
places
by
fantastic
winding
creeks
surrounded
by
box
and
whose
waters
were
rather
temporary
than
permanent
they
originated
in
the
slopes
of
the
buffalo
ranges
a
chain
of
mountains
of
moderate
height
the
undulating
line
of
which
was
visible
on
the
horizon
it
was
resolved
to
camp
there
the
same
night
ayrton
goaded
on
his
team
and
after
a
journey
of
miles
the
bullocks
arrived
somewhat
fatigued
the
tent
was
pitched
beneath
the
great
trees
and
as
night
had
drawn
on
supper
was
served
as
quickly
as
possible
for
all
the
party
cared
more
for
sleeping
than
eating
after
such
a
day
s
march
paganel
who
had
the
first
watch
did
not
lie
down
but
shouldered
his
rifle
and
walked
up
and
down
before
the
camp
to
keep
himself
from
going
to
sleep
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
the
moon
the
night
was
almost
luminous
with
the
light
of
the
southern
constellations
the
savant
amused
himself
with
reading
the
great
book
of
the
firmament
a
book
which
is
always
open
and
full
of
interest
to
those
who
can
read
it
the
profound
silence
of
sleeping
nature
was
only
interrupted
by
the
clanking
of
the
hobbles
on
the
horses
feet
paganel
was
engrossed
in
his
astronomical
meditations
and
thinking
more
about
the
celestial
than
the
terrestrial
world
when
a
distant
sound
aroused
him
from
his
reverie
he
listened
attentively
and
to
his
great
amaze
fancied
he
heard
the
sounds
of
a
piano
he
could
not
be
mistaken
for
he
distinctly
heard
chords
struck
a
piano
in
the
wilds
said
paganel
to
himself
i
can
never
believe
it
is
it
certainly
was
very
surprising
but
paganel
found
it
easier
to
believe
it
was
some
australian
bird
imitating
the
sounds
of
a
pleyel
or
erard
as
others
do
the
sounds
of
a
clock
or
mill
but
at
this
very
moment
the
notes
of
a
clear
ringing
voice
rose
on
the
air
the
pianist
was
accompanied
by
singing
still
paganel
was
unwilling
to
be
convinced
however
next
minute
he
was
forced
to
admit
the
fact
for
there
fell
on
his
ear
the
sublime
strains
of
mozart
s
il
mio
tesoro
tanto
from
don
juan
well
now
said
the
geographer
to
himself
let
the
australian
birds
be
as
queer
as
they
may
and
even
granting
the
paroquets
are
the
most
musical
in
the
world
they
can
t
sing
mozart
he
listened
to
the
sublime
inspiration
of
the
great
master
to
the
end
the
effect
of
this
soft
melody
on
the
still
clear
night
was
indescribable
paganel
remained
as
if
spellbound
for
a
time
the
voice
ceased
and
all
was
silence
when
wilson
came
to
relieve
the
watch
he
found
the
geographer
plunged
into
a
deep
reverie
paganel
made
no
remark
however
to
the
sailor
but
reserved
his
information
for
glenarvan
in
the
morning
and
went
into
the
tent
to
bed
next
day
they
were
all
aroused
from
sleep
by
the
sudden
loud
barking
of
dogs
glenarvan
got
up
forthwith
two
magnificent
pointers
admirable
specimens
of
english
hunting
dogs
were
bounding
in
front
of
the
little
wood
into
which
they
had
retreated
at
the
approach
of
the
travelers
redoubling
their
clamor
there
is
some
station
in
this
desert
then
said
glenarvan
and
hunters
too
for
these
are
regular
paganel
was
just
about
to
recount
his
nocturnal
experiences
when
two
young
men
appeared
mounted
on
horses
of
the
most
perfect
breed
true
the
two
gentlemen
dressed
in
elegant
hunting
costume
stopped
at
the
sight
of
the
little
group
camping
in
gipsy
fashion
they
looked
as
if
they
wondered
what
could
bring
an
armed
party
there
but
when
they
saw
the
ladies
get
out
of
the
wagon
they
dismounted
instantly
and
went
toward
them
hat
in
hand
lord
glenarvan
came
to
meet
them
and
as
a
stranger
announced
his
name
and
rank
the
gentlemen
bowed
and
the
elder
of
them
said
my
lord
will
not
these
ladies
and
yourself
and
friends
honor
us
by
resting
a
little
beneath
our
roof
began
glenarvan
michael
and
sandy
patterson
are
our
names
proprietors
of
hottam
station
our
house
is
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
gentlemen
replied
glenarvan
i
should
not
like
to
abuse
such
my
lord
returned
michael
patterson
by
accepting
it
you
will
confer
a
favor
on
poor
exiles
who
will
be
only
too
happy
to
do
the
honors
of
the
glenarvan
bowed
in
token
of
acquiescence
sir
said
paganel
addressing
michael
patterson
if
it
is
not
an
impudent
question
may
i
ask
whether
it
was
you
that
sung
an
air
from
the
divine
mozart
last
night
it
was
sir
replied
the
stranger
and
my
cousin
sandy
accompanied
well
sir
replied
paganel
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
young
man
receive
the
sincere
compliments
of
a
frenchman
who
is
a
passionate
admirer
of
this
michael
grasped
his
hand
cordially
and
then
pointing
out
the
road
to
take
set
off
accompanied
by
the
ladies
and
lord
glenarvan
and
his
friends
for
the
station
the
horses
and
the
camp
were
left
to
the
care
of
ayrton
and
the
sailors
hottam
station
was
truly
a
magnificent
establishment
kept
as
scrupulously
in
order
as
an
english
park
immense
meadows
enclosed
in
gray
fences
stretched
away
out
of
sight
in
these
thousands
of
bullocks
and
millions
of
sheep
were
grazing
tended
by
numerous
shepherds
and
still
more
numerous
dogs
the
crack
of
the
mingled
continually
with
the
barking
of
the
collies
and
the
bellowing
and
bleating
of
the
cattle
and
sheep
toward
the
east
there
was
a
boundary
of
myalls
and
beyond
which
rose
mount
hottam
its
imposing
peak
towering
feet
high
long
avenues
of
green
trees
were
visible
on
all
sides
here
and
there
was
a
thick
clump
of
grass
trees
tall
bushes
ten
feet
high
like
the
dwarf
palm
quite
lost
in
their
crown
of
long
narrow
leaves
the
air
was
balmy
and
odorous
with
the
perfume
of
scented
laurels
whose
white
blossoms
now
in
full
bloom
distilled
on
the
breeze
the
finest
aromatic
perfume
to
these
charming
groups
of
native
trees
were
added
transplantations
from
european
climates
the
peach
pear
and
apple
trees
were
there
the
fig
the
orange
and
even
the
oak
to
the
rapturous
delight
of
the
travelers
who
greeted
them
with
loud
hurrahs
but
astonished
as
the
travelers
were
to
find
themselves
walking
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
trees
of
their
own
native
land
they
were
still
more
so
at
the
sight
of
the
birds
that
flew
about
in
the
branches
the
satin
bird
with
its
silky
plumage
and
the
with
their
plumage
of
gold
and
black
velvet
for
the
first
time
too
they
saw
here
the
lyre
bird
the
tail
of
which
resembles
in
form
the
graceful
instrument
of
orpheus
it
flew
about
among
the
tree
ferns
and
when
its
tail
struck
the
branches
they
were
almost
surprised
not
to
hear
the
harmonious
strains
that
inspired
amphion
to
rebuild
the
walls
of
thebes
paganel
had
a
great
desire
to
play
on
it
however
lord
glenarvan
was
not
satisfied
with
admiring
the
wonders
of
this
oasis
improvised
in
the
australian
desert
he
was
listening
to
the
history
of
the
young
gentlemen
in
england
in
the
midst
of
civilized
countries
the
new
comer
acquaints
his
host
whence
he
comes
and
whither
he
is
going
but
here
by
a
refinement
of
delicacy
michael
and
sandy
patterson
thought
it
a
duty
to
make
themselves
known
to
the
strangers
who
were
about
to
receive
their
hospitality
michael
and
sandy
patterson
were
the
sons
of
london
bankers
when
they
were
twenty
years
of
age
the
head
of
their
family
said
here
are
some
thousands
young
men
go
to
a
distant
colony
and
start
some
useful
settlement
there
learn
to
know
life
by
labor
if
you
succeed
so
much
the
better
if
you
fail
it
won
t
matter
much
we
shall
not
regret
the
money
which
makes
you
the
two
young
men
obeyed
they
chose
the
colony
of
victoria
in
australia
as
the
field
for
sowing
the
paternal
and
had
no
reason
to
repent
the
selection
at
the
end
of
three
years
the
establishment
was
flourishing
in
victoria
new
south
wales
and
southern
australia
there
are
more
than
three
thousand
stations
some
belonging
to
squatters
who
rear
cattle
and
others
to
settlers
who
farm
the
ground
till
the
arrival
of
the
two
pattersons
the
largest
establishment
of
this
sort
was
that
of
jamieson
which
covered
an
area
of
miles
with
a
frontage
of
about
eight
miles
along
the
peron
one
of
the
affluents
of
the
darling
now
hottam
station
bore
the
palm
for
business
and
extent
the
young
men
were
both
squatters
and
settlers
they
managed
their
immense
property
with
rare
ability
and
uncommon
energy
the
station
was
far
removed
from
the
chief
towns
in
the
midst
of
the
unfrequented
districts
of
the
murray
it
occupied
a
long
wide
space
of
five
leagues
in
extent
lying
between
the
buffalo
ranges
and
mount
hottam
at
the
two
angles
north
of
this
vast
quadrilateral
mount
aberdeen
rose
on
the
left
and
the
peaks
of
high
barven
on
the
right
winding
beautiful
streams
were
not
wanting
thanks
to
the
creeks
and
affluents
of
the
oven
s
river
which
throws
itself
at
the
north
into
the
bed
of
the
murray
consequently
they
were
equally
successful
in
cattle
breeding
and
farming
ten
thousand
acres
of
ground
admirably
cultivated
produced
harvests
of
native
productions
and
exotics
and
several
millions
of
animals
fattened
in
the
fertile
pastures
the
products
of
hottam
station
fetched
the
very
highest
price
in
the
markets
of
castlemaine
and
melbourne
michael
and
sandy
patterson
had
just
concluded
these
details
of
their
busy
life
when
their
dwelling
came
in
sight
at
the
extremity
of
the
avenue
of
the
oaks
it
was
a
charming
house
built
of
wood
and
brick
hidden
in
groves
of
emerophilis
nothing
at
all
however
belonging
to
a
station
was
visible
neither
sheds
nor
stables
nor
all
these
a
perfect
village
comprising
more
than
twenty
huts
and
houses
were
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
in
the
heart
of
a
little
valley
electric
communication
was
established
between
this
village
and
the
master
s
house
which
far
removed
from
all
noise
seemed
buried
in
a
forest
of
exotic
trees
at
sandy
patterson
s
bidding
a
sumptuous
breakfast
was
served
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
wines
and
viands
were
of
the
finest
quality
but
what
pleased
the
guests
most
of
all
in
the
midst
of
these
refinements
of
opulence
was
the
joy
of
the
young
squatters
in
offering
them
this
splendid
hospitality
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
told
the
history
of
the
expedition
and
had
their
liveliest
interest
awakened
for
its
success
they
spoke
hopefully
to
the
young
grants
and
michael
said
harry
grant
has
evidently
fallen
into
the
hands
of
natives
since
he
has
not
turned
up
at
any
of
the
settlements
on
the
coast
he
knows
his
position
exactly
as
the
document
proves
and
the
reason
he
did
not
reach
some
english
colony
is
that
he
must
have
been
taken
prisoner
by
the
savages
the
moment
he
landed
that
is
precisely
what
befell
his
quartermaster
ayrton
said
john
mangles
but
you
gentlemen
then
have
never
heard
the
catastrophe
of
the
britannia
mentioned
inquired
lady
helena
never
madam
replied
michael
and
what
treatment
in
your
opinion
has
captain
grant
met
with
among
the
natives
the
australians
are
not
cruel
madam
replied
the
young
squatter
and
miss
grant
may
be
easy
on
that
score
there
have
been
many
instances
of
the
gentleness
of
their
nature
and
some
europeans
have
lived
a
long
time
among
them
without
having
the
least
cause
to
complain
of
their
king
among
others
the
sole
survivor
of
the
burke
expedition
put
in
paganel
and
not
only
that
bold
explorer
returned
sandy
but
also
an
english
soldier
named
buckley
who
deserted
at
port
philip
in
and
who
was
welcomed
by
the
natives
and
lived
years
among
and
more
recently
added
michael
one
of
the
last
numbers
of
the
australasia
informs
us
that
a
certain
morrilli
has
just
been
restored
to
his
countrymen
after
sixteen
years
of
slavery
his
story
is
exactly
similar
to
the
captain
s
for
it
was
at
the
very
time
of
his
shipwreck
in
the
pruvienne
in
that
he
was
made
prisoner
by
the
natives
and
dragged
away
into
the
interior
of
the
continent
i
therefore
think
you
have
reason
to
hope
the
young
squatter
s
words
caused
great
joy
to
his
auditors
they
completely
corroborated
the
opinions
of
paganel
and
ayrton
the
conversation
turned
on
the
convicts
after
the
ladies
had
left
the
table
the
squatters
had
heard
of
the
catastrophe
at
camden
bridge
but
felt
no
uneasiness
about
the
escaped
gang
it
was
not
a
station
with
more
than
a
hundred
men
on
it
that
they
would
dare
to
attack
besides
they
would
never
go
into
the
deserts
of
the
murray
where
they
could
find
no
booty
nor
near
the
colonies
of
new
south
wales
where
the
roads
were
too
well
watched
ayrton
had
said
this
too
glenarvan
could
not
refuse
the
request
of
his
amiable
hosts
to
spend
the
whole
day
at
the
station
it
was
twelve
hours
delay
but
also
twelve
hours
rest
and
both
horses
and
bullocks
would
be
the
better
for
the
comfortable
quarters
they
would
find
there
this
was
accordingly
agreed
upon
and
the
young
squatters
sketched
out
a
programme
of
the
day
s
amusements
which
was
adopted
eagerly
at
noon
seven
vigorous
hunters
were
before
the
door
an
elegant
brake
was
intended
for
the
ladies
in
which
the
coachman
could
exhibit
his
skill
in
driving
the
cavalcade
set
off
preceded
by
huntsmen
and
armed
with
rifles
followed
by
a
pack
of
pointers
barking
joyously
as
they
bounded
through
the
bushes
for
four
hours
the
hunting
party
wandered
through
the
paths
and
avenues
of
the
park
which
was
as
large
as
a
small
german
state
the
or
gotha
would
have
gone
inside
it
comfortably
few
people
were
to
be
met
in
it
certainly
but
sheep
in
abundance
as
for
game
there
was
a
complete
preserve
awaiting
the
hunters
the
noisy
reports
of
guns
were
soon
heard
on
all
sides
little
robert
did
wonders
in
company
with
major
mcnabbs
the
daring
boy
in
spite
of
his
sister
s
injunctions
was
always
in
front
and
the
first
to
fire
but
john
mangles
promised
to
watch
over
him
and
mary
felt
less
uneasy
during
this
battue
they
killed
certain
animals
peculiar
to
the
country
the
very
names
of
which
were
unknown
to
paganel
among
others
the
wombat
and
the
the
wombat
is
an
herbivorous
animal
which
burrows
in
the
ground
like
a
badger
it
is
as
large
as
a
sheep
and
the
flesh
is
excellent
the
bandicoot
is
a
species
of
marsupial
animal
which
could
outwit
the
european
fox
and
give
him
lessons
in
pillaging
poultry
yards
it
was
a
animal
a
foot
and
a
half
long
but
as
paganel
chanced
to
kill
it
of
course
he
thought
it
charming
an
adorable
creature
he
called
it
but
the
most
interesting
event
of
the
day
by
far
was
the
kangaroo
hunt
about
four
o
clock
the
dogs
roused
a
troop
of
these
curious
marsupials
the
little
ones
retreated
precipitately
into
the
maternal
pouch
and
all
the
troop
decamped
in
file
nothing
could
be
more
astonishing
than
the
enormous
bounds
of
the
kangaroo
the
hind
legs
of
the
animal
are
twice
as
long
as
the
front
ones
and
unbend
like
a
spring
at
the
head
of
the
flying
troop
was
a
male
five
feet
high
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
an
old
man
as
the
bushmen
say
for
four
or
five
miles
the
chase
was
vigorously
pursued
the
kangaroos
showed
no
signs
of
weariness
and
the
dogs
who
had
reason
enough
to
fear
their
strong
paws
and
sharp
nails
did
not
care
to
approach
them
but
at
last
worn
out
with
the
race
the
troop
stopped
and
the
old
man
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
ready
to
defend
himself
one
of
the
pointers
carried
away
by
excitement
went
up
to
him
next
minute
the
unfortunate
beast
leaped
into
the
air
and
fell
down
again
completely
ripped
up
the
whole
pack
indeed
would
have
had
little
chance
with
these
powerful
marsupia
they
had
to
dispatch
the
fellow
with
rifles
nothing
but
balls
could
bring
down
the
gigantic
animal
just
at
this
moment
robert
was
well
nigh
the
victim
of
his
own
imprudence
to
make
sure
of
his
aim
he
had
approached
too
near
the
kangaroo
and
the
animal
leaped
upon
him
immediately
robert
gave
a
loud
cry
and
fell
mary
grant
saw
it
all
from
the
brake
and
in
an
agony
of
terror
speechless
and
almost
unable
even
to
see
stretched
out
her
arms
toward
her
little
brother
no
one
dared
to
fire
for
fear
of
wounding
the
child
but
john
mangles
opened
his
hunting
knife
and
at
the
risk
of
being
ripped
up
himself
sprang
at
the
animal
and
plunged
it
into
his
heart
the
beast
dropped
forward
and
robert
rose
unhurt
next
minute
he
was
in
his
sister
s
arms
thank
you
john
thank
you
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
the
young
captain
i
had
pledged
myself
for
his
safety
was
all
john
said
taking
her
trembling
fingers
into
his
own
this
occurrence
ended
the
sport
the
band
of
marsupia
had
disappeared
after
the
death
of
their
leader
the
hunting
party
returned
home
bringing
their
game
with
them
it
was
then
six
o
clock
a
magnificent
dinner
was
ready
among
other
things
there
was
one
dish
that
was
a
great
success
it
was
soup
prepared
in
the
native
manner
next
morning
very
early
they
took
leave
of
the
young
squatters
with
hearty
thanks
and
a
positive
promise
from
them
of
a
visit
to
malcolm
castle
when
they
should
return
to
europe
then
the
wagon
began
to
move
away
round
the
foot
of
mount
hottam
and
soon
the
hospitable
dwelling
disappeared
from
the
sight
of
the
travelers
like
some
brief
vision
which
had
come
and
gone
for
five
miles
further
the
horses
were
still
treading
the
station
lands
it
was
not
till
nine
o
clock
that
they
had
passed
the
last
fence
and
entered
the
almost
unknown
districts
of
the
province
of
victoria
chapter
xv
suspicious
occurrences
an
immense
barrier
lay
across
the
route
to
the
southeast
it
was
the
australian
alps
a
vast
fortification
the
fantastic
curtain
of
which
extended
miles
and
pierced
the
clouds
at
the
height
of
feet
the
cloudy
sky
only
allowed
the
heat
to
reach
the
ground
through
a
close
veil
of
mist
the
temperature
was
just
bearable
but
the
road
was
toilsome
from
its
uneven
character
the
extumescences
on
the
plain
became
more
and
more
marked
several
mounds
planted
with
green
young
gum
trees
appeared
here
and
there
further
on
these
protuberances
rising
sharply
formed
the
first
steps
of
the
great
alps
from
this
time
their
course
was
a
continual
ascent
as
was
soon
evident
in
the
strain
it
made
on
the
bullocks
to
drag
along
the
cumbrous
wagon
their
yoke
creaked
they
breathed
heavily
and
the
muscles
of
their
houghs
were
stretched
as
if
they
would
burst
the
planks
of
the
vehicle
groaned
at
the
unexpected
jolts
which
ayrton
with
all
his
skill
could
not
prevent
the
ladies
bore
their
share
of
discomfort
bravely
john
mangles
and
his
two
sailors
acted
as
scouts
and
went
about
a
hundred
steps
in
advance
they
found
out
practical
paths
or
passes
indeed
they
might
be
called
for
these
projections
of
the
ground
were
like
so
many
rocks
between
which
the
wagon
had
to
steer
carefully
it
required
absolute
navigation
to
find
a
safe
way
over
the
billowy
region
it
was
a
difficult
and
often
perilous
task
many
a
time
wilson
s
hatchet
was
obliged
to
open
a
passage
through
thick
tangles
of
shrubs
the
damp
argillaceous
soil
gave
way
under
their
feet
the
route
was
indefinitely
prolonged
owing
to
the
insurmountable
obstacles
huge
blocks
of
granite
deep
ravines
suspected
lagoons
which
obliged
them
to
make
a
thousand
detours
when
night
came
they
found
they
had
only
gone
over
half
a
degree
they
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
of
cobongra
on
the
edge
of
a
little
plain
covered
with
little
shrubs
four
feet
high
with
bright
red
leaves
which
gladdened
the
eye
we
shall
have
hard
work
to
get
over
said
glenarvan
looking
at
the
chain
of
mountains
the
outlines
of
which
were
fast
fading
away
in
the
deepening
darkness
the
very
name
alps
gives
plenty
of
room
for
it
is
not
quite
so
big
as
it
sounds
my
dear
glenarvan
don
t
suppose
you
have
a
whole
switzerland
to
traverse
in
australia
there
are
the
grampians
the
pyrenees
the
alps
the
blue
mountains
as
in
europe
and
america
but
in
miniature
this
simply
implies
either
that
the
imagination
of
geographers
is
not
infinite
or
that
their
vocabulary
of
proper
names
is
very
then
these
australian
alps
said
lord
glenarvan
are
mere
pocket
mountains
put
in
paganel
we
shall
get
over
them
without
knowing
speak
for
yourself
said
the
major
it
would
certainly
take
a
very
absent
man
who
could
cross
over
a
chain
of
mountains
and
not
know
absent
but
i
am
not
an
absent
man
now
i
appeal
to
the
ladies
since
ever
i
set
foot
on
the
australian
continent
have
i
been
once
at
fault
can
you
reproach
me
with
a
single
blunder
not
one
monsieur
paganel
said
mary
grant
you
are
now
the
most
perfect
of
too
perfect
added
lady
helena
laughing
your
blunders
suited
you
didn
t
they
madam
if
i
have
no
faults
now
i
shall
soon
get
like
everybody
else
i
hope
then
i
shall
make
some
outrageous
mistake
before
long
which
will
give
you
a
good
laugh
you
see
unless
i
make
mistakes
it
seems
to
me
i
fail
in
my
next
day
the
of
january
notwithstanding
the
assurances
of
the
confident
geographer
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
that
the
little
troop
made
its
way
through
the
alpine
pass
they
were
obliged
to
go
at
a
venture
and
enter
the
depths
of
narrow
gorges
without
any
certainty
of
an
outlet
ayrton
would
doubtless
have
found
himself
very
much
embarrassed
if
a
little
inn
a
miserable
public
house
had
not
suddenly
presented
itself
my
goodness
cried
paganel
the
landlord
of
this
inn
won
t
make
his
fortune
in
a
place
like
this
what
is
the
use
of
it
here
to
give
us
the
information
we
want
about
the
route
replied
glenarvan
let
us
go
glenarvan
followed
by
ayrton
entered
the
inn
forthwith
the
landlord
of
the
bush
inn
as
it
was
called
was
a
coarse
man
with
an
face
who
must
have
considered
himself
his
principal
customer
for
the
gin
brandy
and
whisky
he
had
to
sell
he
seldom
saw
any
one
but
the
squatters
and
rovers
he
answered
all
the
questions
put
to
him
in
a
surly
tone
but
his
replies
sufficed
to
make
the
route
clear
to
ayrton
and
that
was
all
that
was
wanted
glenarvan
rewarded
him
with
a
handful
of
silver
for
his
trouble
and
was
about
to
leave
the
tavern
when
a
placard
against
the
wall
arrested
his
attention
it
was
a
police
notice
and
announcing
the
escape
of
the
convicts
from
perth
and
offering
a
reward
for
the
capture
of
ben
joyce
of
pounds
sterling
he
s
a
fellow
that
s
worth
hanging
and
no
mistake
said
glenarvan
to
the
quartermaster
and
worth
capturing
still
more
but
what
a
sum
to
offer
he
is
not
worth
it
i
don
t
feel
very
sure
of
the
innkeeper
though
in
spite
of
the
notice
said
glenarvan
no
more
do
i
replied
ayrton
they
went
back
to
the
wagon
toward
the
point
where
the
route
to
lucknow
stopped
a
narrow
path
wound
away
from
this
which
led
across
the
chain
in
a
slanting
direction
they
had
commenced
the
ascent
it
was
hard
work
more
than
once
both
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
to
get
down
and
walk
they
were
obliged
to
help
to
push
round
the
wheels
of
the
heavy
vehicle
and
to
support
it
frequently
in
dangerous
declivities
to
unharness
the
bullocks
when
the
team
could
not
go
well
round
sharp
turnings
prop
up
the
wagon
when
it
threatened
to
roll
back
and
more
than
once
ayrton
had
to
reinforce
his
bullocks
by
harnessing
the
horses
although
they
were
tired
out
already
with
dragging
themselves
along
whether
it
was
this
prolonged
fatigue
or
from
some
other
cause
altogether
was
not
known
but
one
of
the
horses
sank
suddenly
without
the
slightest
symptom
of
illness
it
was
mulrady
s
horse
that
fell
and
on
attempting
to
pull
it
up
the
animal
was
found
to
be
dead
ayrton
examined
it
immediately
but
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
disaster
the
beast
must
have
broken
some
blood
vessels
said
glenarvan
evidently
replied
ayrton
take
my
horse
mulrady
added
glenarvan
i
will
join
lady
helena
in
the
mulrady
obeyed
and
the
little
party
continued
their
fatiguing
ascent
leaving
the
carcass
of
the
dead
animal
to
the
ravens
the
australian
alps
are
of
no
great
thickness
and
the
base
is
not
more
than
eight
miles
wide
consequently
if
the
pass
chosen
by
ayrton
came
out
on
the
eastern
side
they
might
hope
to
get
over
the
high
barrier
within
hours
more
the
difficulty
of
the
route
would
then
be
surmounted
and
they
would
only
have
to
get
to
the
sea
during
the
the
travelers
reached
the
point
of
the
pass
about
feet
high
they
found
themselves
on
an
open
plateau
with
nothing
to
intercept
the
view
toward
the
north
the
quiet
waters
of
lake
omco
all
alive
with
aquatic
birds
and
beyond
this
lay
the
vast
plains
of
the
murray
to
the
south
were
the
wide
spreading
plains
of
gippsland
with
its
abundant
and
tall
forests
there
nature
was
still
mistress
of
the
products
and
water
and
great
trees
where
the
woodman
s
ax
was
as
yet
unknown
and
the
squatters
then
five
in
number
could
not
struggle
against
her
it
seemed
as
if
this
chain
of
the
alps
separated
two
different
countries
one
of
which
had
retained
its
primitive
wildness
the
sun
went
down
and
a
few
solitary
rays
piercing
the
rosy
clouds
lighted
up
the
murray
district
leaving
gippsland
in
deep
shadow
as
if
night
had
suddenly
fallen
on
the
whole
region
the
contrast
was
presented
very
vividly
to
the
spectators
placed
between
these
two
countries
so
divided
and
some
emotion
filled
the
minds
of
the
travelers
as
they
contemplated
the
almost
unknown
district
they
were
about
to
traverse
right
to
the
frontiers
of
victoria
they
camped
on
the
plateau
that
night
and
next
day
the
descent
commenced
it
was
tolerably
rapid
a
hailstorm
of
extreme
violence
assailed
the
travelers
and
obliged
them
to
seek
a
shelter
among
the
rocks
it
was
not
but
regular
lumps
of
ice
as
large
as
one
s
hand
which
fell
from
the
stormy
clouds
a
waterspout
could
not
have
come
down
with
more
violence
and
sundry
big
bruises
warned
paganel
and
robert
to
retreat
the
wagon
was
riddled
in
several
places
and
few
coverings
would
have
held
out
against
those
sharp
icicles
some
of
which
had
fastened
themselves
into
the
trunks
of
the
trees
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
till
this
tremendous
shower
was
over
unless
the
travelers
wished
to
be
stoned
it
lasted
about
an
hour
and
then
the
march
commenced
anew
over
slanting
rocks
still
slippery
after
the
hail
toward
evening
the
wagon
very
much
shaken
and
disjointed
in
several
parts
but
still
standing
firm
on
its
wooden
disks
came
down
the
last
slopes
of
the
alps
among
great
isolated
pines
the
passage
ended
in
the
plains
of
gippsland
the
chain
of
the
alps
was
safely
passed
and
the
usual
arrangements
were
made
for
the
nightly
encampment
on
the
at
daybreak
the
journey
was
resumed
with
an
ardor
which
never
relaxed
everyone
was
eager
to
reach
the
goal
that
is
to
say
the
pacific
ocean
at
that
part
where
the
wreck
of
the
britannia
had
occurred
nothing
could
be
done
in
the
lonely
wilds
of
gippsland
and
ayrton
urged
lord
glenarvan
to
send
orders
at
once
for
the
duncan
to
repair
to
the
coast
in
order
to
have
at
hand
all
means
of
research
he
thought
it
would
certainly
be
advisable
to
take
advantage
of
the
lucknow
route
to
melbourne
if
they
waited
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
any
way
of
direct
communication
with
the
capital
this
advice
seemed
good
and
paganel
recommended
that
they
should
act
upon
it
he
also
thought
that
the
presence
of
the
yacht
would
be
very
useful
and
he
added
that
if
the
lucknow
road
was
once
passed
it
would
be
impossible
to
communicate
with
melbourne
glenarvan
was
undecided
what
to
do
and
perhaps
he
would
have
yielded
to
ayrton
s
arguments
if
the
major
had
not
combated
this
decision
vigorously
he
maintained
that
the
presence
of
ayrton
was
necessary
to
the
expedition
that
he
would
know
the
country
about
the
coast
and
that
if
any
chance
should
put
them
on
the
track
of
harry
grant
the
quartermaster
would
be
better
able
to
follow
it
up
than
any
one
else
and
finally
that
he
alone
could
point
out
the
exact
spot
where
the
shipwreck
occurred
mcnabbs
voted
therefore
for
the
continuation
of
the
voyage
without
making
the
least
change
in
their
programme
john
mangles
was
of
the
same
opinion
the
young
captain
said
even
that
orders
would
reach
the
duncan
more
easily
from
twofold
bay
than
if
a
message
was
sent
two
hundred
miles
over
a
wild
country
his
counsel
prevailed
it
was
decided
that
they
should
wait
till
they
came
to
twofold
bay
the
major
watched
ayrton
narrowly
and
noticed
his
disappointed
look
but
he
said
nothing
keeping
his
observations
as
usual
to
himself
the
plains
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
australian
alps
were
level
but
slightly
inclined
toward
the
east
great
clumps
of
mimosas
and
eucalyptus
and
various
odorous
broke
the
uniform
monotony
here
and
there
the
covered
the
ground
with
its
bushes
covered
with
gay
flowers
several
unimportant
creeks
mere
streams
full
of
little
rushes
and
half
covered
up
with
orchids
often
interrupted
the
route
they
had
to
ford
these
flocks
of
bustards
and
emus
fled
at
the
approach
of
the
travelers
below
the
shrubs
kangaroos
were
leaping
and
springing
like
dancing
jacks
but
the
hunters
of
the
party
were
not
thinking
much
of
the
sport
and
the
horses
little
needed
any
additional
fatigue
moreover
a
sultry
heat
oppressed
the
plain
the
atmosphere
was
completely
saturated
with
electricity
and
its
influence
was
felt
by
men
and
beasts
they
just
dragged
themselves
along
and
cared
for
nothing
else
the
silence
was
only
interrupted
by
the
cries
of
ayrton
urging
on
his
burdened
team
from
noon
to
two
o
clock
they
went
through
a
curious
forest
of
ferns
which
would
have
excited
the
admiration
of
less
weary
travelers
these
plants
in
full
flower
measured
thirty
feet
in
height
horses
and
riders
passed
easily
beneath
their
drooping
leaves
and
sometimes
the
spurs
would
clash
against
the
woody
stems
beneath
these
immovable
parasols
there
was
a
refreshing
coolness
which
every
one
appreciated
jacques
paganel
always
demonstrative
gave
such
deep
sighs
of
satisfaction
that
the
paroquets
and
cockatoos
flew
out
in
alarm
making
a
deafening
chorus
of
noisy
chatter
the
geographer
was
going
on
with
his
sighs
and
jubilations
with
the
utmost
coolness
when
his
companions
suddenly
saw
him
reel
forward
and
he
and
his
horse
fell
down
in
a
lump
was
it
giddiness
or
worse
still
suffocation
caused
by
the
high
temperature
they
ran
to
him
exclaiming
paganel
paganel
what
is
the
matter
just
this
i
have
no
horse
now
he
replied
disengaging
his
feet
from
the
stirrups
what
your
horse
dead
like
mulrady
s
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
struck
glenarvan
john
mangles
and
wilson
examined
the
animal
and
found
paganel
was
right
his
horse
had
been
suddenly
struck
dead
that
is
strange
said
john
very
strange
truly
muttered
the
major
glenarvan
was
greatly
disturbed
by
this
fresh
accident
he
could
not
get
a
fresh
horse
in
the
desert
and
if
an
epidemic
was
going
to
seize
their
steeds
they
would
be
seriously
embarrassed
how
to
proceed
before
the
close
of
the
day
it
seemed
as
if
the
word
epidemic
was
really
going
to
be
justified
a
third
horse
wilson
s
fell
dead
and
what
was
perhaps
equally
disastrous
one
of
the
bullocks
also
the
means
of
traction
and
transport
were
now
reduced
to
three
bullocks
and
four
horses
the
situation
became
grave
the
unmounted
horsemen
might
walk
of
course
as
many
squatters
had
done
already
but
if
they
abandoned
the
wagon
what
would
the
ladies
do
could
they
go
over
the
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
which
lay
between
them
and
twofold
bay
john
mangles
and
lord
glenarvan
examined
the
surviving
horses
with
great
uneasiness
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
symptom
of
illness
or
feebleness
in
them
the
animals
were
in
perfect
health
and
bravely
bearing
the
fatigues
of
the
voyage
this
somewhat
reassured
glenarvan
and
made
him
hope
the
malady
would
strike
no
more
victims
ayrton
agreed
with
him
but
was
unable
to
find
the
least
solution
of
the
mystery
they
went
on
again
the
wagon
serving
from
time
to
time
as
a
house
of
rest
for
the
pedestrians
in
the
evening
after
a
march
of
only
ten
miles
the
signal
to
halt
was
given
and
the
tent
pitched
the
night
passed
without
inconvenience
beneath
a
vast
mass
of
bushy
ferns
under
which
enormous
bats
properly
called
flying
foxes
were
flapping
about
the
next
day
s
journey
was
good
there
were
no
new
calamities
the
health
of
the
expedition
remained
satisfactory
horses
and
cattle
did
their
task
cheerily
lady
helena
s
was
very
lively
thanks
to
the
number
of
visitors
olbinett
busied
himself
in
passing
round
refreshments
which
were
very
acceptable
in
such
hot
weather
half
a
barrel
of
scotch
ale
was
sent
in
bodily
barclay
and
was
declared
to
be
the
greatest
man
in
great
britain
even
above
wellington
who
could
never
have
manufactured
such
good
beer
this
was
a
scotch
estimate
jacques
paganel
drank
largely
and
discoursed
still
more
omni
re
a
day
so
well
commenced
seemed
as
if
it
could
not
but
end
well
they
had
gone
fifteen
good
miles
and
managed
to
get
over
a
pretty
hilly
district
where
the
soil
was
reddish
there
was
every
reason
to
hope
they
might
camp
that
same
night
on
the
banks
of
the
snowy
river
an
important
river
which
throws
itself
into
the
pacific
south
of
victoria
already
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
were
making
deep
ruts
on
the
wide
plains
covered
with
blackish
alluvium
as
it
passed
on
between
tufts
of
luxuriant
grass
and
fresh
fields
of
gastrolobium
as
evening
came
on
a
white
mist
on
the
horizon
marked
the
course
of
the
snowy
river
several
additional
miles
were
got
over
and
a
forest
of
tall
trees
came
in
sight
at
a
bend
of
the
road
behind
a
gentle
eminence
ayrton
turned
his
team
a
little
toward
the
great
trunks
lost
in
shadow
and
he
had
got
to
the
skirts
of
the
wood
about
from
the
river
when
the
wagon
suddenly
sank
up
to
the
middle
of
the
wheels
stop
he
called
out
to
the
horsemen
following
him
what
is
wrong
inquired
glenarvan
we
have
stuck
in
the
mud
replied
ayrton
he
tried
to
stimulate
the
bullocks
to
a
fresh
effort
by
voice
and
goad
but
the
animals
were
buried
up
their
legs
and
could
not
stir
let
us
camp
here
suggested
john
mangles
it
would
certainly
be
the
best
place
said
ayrton
we
shall
see
by
daylight
how
to
get
ourselves
glenarvan
acted
on
their
advice
and
came
to
a
halt
night
came
on
rapidly
after
a
brief
twilight
but
the
heat
did
not
withdraw
with
the
light
stifling
vapors
filled
the
air
and
occasionally
bright
flashes
of
lightning
the
reflections
of
a
distant
storm
lighted
up
the
sky
with
a
fiery
glare
arrangements
were
made
for
the
night
immediately
they
did
the
best
they
could
with
the
sunk
wagon
and
the
tent
was
pitched
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
great
trees
and
if
the
rain
did
not
come
they
had
not
much
to
complain
about
ayrton
succeeded
though
with
some
difficulty
in
extricating
the
three
bullocks
these
courageous
beasts
were
engulfed
up
to
their
flanks
the
quartermaster
turned
them
out
with
the
four
horses
and
allowed
no
one
but
himself
to
see
after
their
pasturage
he
always
executed
his
task
wisely
and
this
evening
glenarvan
noticed
he
redoubled
his
care
for
which
he
took
occasion
to
thank
him
the
preservation
of
the
team
being
of
supreme
importance
meantime
the
travelers
were
dispatching
a
hasty
supper
fatigue
and
heat
destroy
appetite
and
sleep
was
needed
more
than
food
lady
helena
and
miss
grant
speedily
bade
the
company
and
retired
their
companions
soon
stretched
themselves
under
the
tent
or
outside
under
the
trees
which
is
no
great
hardship
in
this
salubrious
climate
gradually
they
all
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
the
darkness
deepened
owing
to
a
thick
current
of
clouds
which
overspread
the
sky
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
silence
of
night
was
only
interrupted
by
the
cries
of
the
morepork
in
the
minor
key
like
the
mournful
cuckoos
of
europe
towards
eleven
o
clock
after
a
wretched
heavy
unrefreshing
sleep
the
major
woke
his
eyes
were
struck
with
a
faint
light
running
among
the
great
trees
it
looked
like
a
white
sheet
and
glittered
like
a
lake
and
mcnabbs
thought
at
first
it
was
the
commencement
of
a
fire
he
started
up
and
went
toward
the
wood
but
what
was
his
surprise
to
perceive
a
purely
natural
phenomenon
before
him
lay
an
immense
bed
of
mushrooms
which
emitted
a
phosphorescent
light
the
luminous
spores
of
the
cryptograms
shone
in
the
darkness
with
intensity
the
major
who
had
no
selfishness
about
him
was
going
to
waken
paganel
that
he
might
see
this
phenomenon
with
his
own
eyes
when
something
occurred
which
arrested
him
this
phosphorescent
light
illumined
the
distance
half
a
mile
and
mcnabbs
fancied
he
saw
a
shadow
pass
across
the
edge
of
it
were
his
eyes
deceiving
him
was
it
some
hallucination
mcnabbs
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
after
a
close
scrutiny
he
could
distinctly
see
several
men
stooping
down
and
lifting
themselves
up
alternately
as
if
they
were
looking
on
the
ground
for
recent
marks
the
major
resolved
to
find
out
what
these
fellows
were
about
and
without
the
least
hesitation
or
so
much
as
arousing
his
companions
crept
along
lying
flat
on
the
ground
like
a
savage
on
the
prairies
completely
hidden
among
the
long
grass
chapter
xvi
a
startling
discovery
it
was
a
frightful
night
at
two
the
rain
began
to
fall
in
torrents
from
the
stormy
clouds
and
continued
till
daybreak
the
tent
became
an
insufficient
shelter
glenarvan
and
his
companions
took
refuge
in
the
wagon
they
did
not
sleep
but
talked
of
one
thing
and
another
the
major
alone
whose
brief
absence
had
not
been
noticed
contented
himself
with
being
a
silent
listener
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
if
the
storm
lasted
longer
the
snowy
river
would
overflow
its
banks
which
would
be
a
very
unlucky
thing
for
the
wagon
stuck
fast
as
it
was
already
in
the
soft
ground
mulrady
ayrton
and
mangles
went
several
times
to
ascertain
the
height
of
the
water
and
came
back
dripping
from
head
to
foot
at
last
day
appeared
the
rain
ceased
but
sunlight
could
not
break
through
the
thick
clouds
large
patches
of
yellowish
water
muddy
dirty
ponds
indeed
they
were
covered
the
ground
a
hot
steam
rose
from
the
soaking
earth
and
saturated
the
atmosphere
with
unhealthy
humidity
glenarvan
s
first
concern
was
the
wagon
this
was
the
main
thing
in
his
eyes
they
examined
the
ponderous
vehicle
and
found
it
sunk
in
the
mud
in
a
deep
hollow
in
the
stiff
clay
the
forepart
had
disappeared
completely
and
the
hind
part
up
to
the
axle
it
would
be
a
hard
job
to
get
the
heavy
conveyance
out
and
would
need
the
united
strength
of
men
bullocks
and
horses
at
any
rate
we
must
make
haste
said
john
mangles
if
the
clay
dries
it
will
make
our
task
still
more
let
us
be
quick
then
replied
ayrton
glenarvan
his
two
sailors
john
mangles
and
ayrton
went
off
at
once
into
the
wood
where
the
animals
had
passed
the
night
it
was
a
forest
of
tall
nothing
but
dead
trees
with
wide
spaces
between
which
had
been
barked
for
ages
or
rather
skinned
like
the
at
harvest
time
a
miserable
network
of
bare
branches
was
seen
above
two
hundred
feet
high
in
the
air
not
a
bird
built
its
nest
in
these
aerial
skeletons
not
a
leaf
trembled
on
the
dry
branches
which
rattled
together
like
bones
to
what
cataclysm
is
this
phenomenon
to
be
attributed
so
frequent
in
australia
entire
forests
struck
dead
by
some
epidemic
no
one
knows
neither
the
oldest
natives
nor
their
ancestors
who
have
lain
long
buried
in
the
groves
of
the
dead
have
ever
seen
them
green
glenarvan
as
he
went
along
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
gray
sky
on
which
the
smallest
branch
of
the
was
sharply
defined
ayrton
was
astonished
not
to
discover
the
horses
and
bullocks
where
he
had
left
them
the
preceding
night
they
could
not
have
wandered
far
with
the
hobbles
on
their
legs
they
looked
over
the
wood
but
saw
no
signs
of
them
and
ayrton
returned
to
the
banks
of
the
river
where
magnificent
mimosas
were
growing
he
gave
a
cry
well
known
to
his
team
but
there
was
no
reply
the
quartermaster
seemed
uneasy
and
his
companions
looked
at
him
with
disappointed
faces
an
hour
had
passed
in
vain
endeavors
and
glenarvan
was
about
to
go
back
to
the
wagon
when
a
neigh
struck
on
his
ear
and
immediately
after
a
bellow
they
are
there
cried
john
mangles
slipping
between
the
tall
branches
of
gastrolobium
which
grew
high
enough
to
hide
a
whole
flock
glenarvan
mulrady
and
ayrton
darted
after
him
and
speedily
shared
his
stupefaction
at
the
spectacle
which
met
their
gaze
two
bullocks
and
three
horses
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
struck
down
like
the
rest
their
bodies
were
already
cold
and
a
flock
of
looking
ravens
croaking
among
the
mimosas
were
watching
the
unexpected
prey
glenarvan
and
his
party
gazed
at
each
other
and
wilson
could
not
keep
back
the
oath
that
rose
to
his
lips
what
do
you
mean
wilson
said
glenarvan
with
difficulty
controlling
himself
ayrton
bring
away
the
bullock
and
the
horse
we
have
left
they
will
have
to
serve
us
if
the
wagon
were
not
sunk
in
the
mud
said
john
mangles
these
two
animals
by
making
short
journeys
would
be
able
to
take
us
to
the
coast
so
we
must
get
the
vehicle
out
cost
what
it
we
will
try
john
replied
glenarvan
let
us
go
back
now
or
they
will
be
uneasy
at
our
long
ayrton
removed
the
hobbles
from
the
bullock
and
mulrady
from
the
horse
and
they
began
to
return
to
the
encampment
following
the
winding
margin
of
the
river
in
half
an
hour
they
rejoined
paganel
and
mcnabbs
and
the
ladies
and
told
them
of
this
fresh
disaster
upon
my
honor
ayrton
the
major
could
not
help
saying
it
is
a
pity
that
you
hadn
t
had
the
shoeing
of
all
our
beasts
when
we
forded
the
why
sir
asked
ayrton
because
out
of
all
our
horses
only
the
one
your
blacksmith
had
in
his
hands
has
escaped
the
common
that
s
true
said
john
mangles
it
s
strange
it
happens
a
mere
chance
and
nothing
more
replied
the
quartermaster
looking
firmly
at
the
major
major
mcnabbs
bit
his
lips
as
if
to
keep
back
something
he
was
about
to
say
glenarvan
and
the
rest
waited
for
him
to
speak
out
his
thoughts
but
the
major
was
silent
and
went
up
to
the
wagon
which
ayrton
was
examining
what
was
he
going
to
say
mangles
asked
glenarvan
i
don
t
know
replied
the
young
captain
but
the
major
is
not
at
all
a
man
to
speak
without
no
john
said
lady
helena
mcnabbs
must
have
suspicions
about
suspicions
exclaimed
paganel
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
what
can
they
be
asked
glenarvan
does
he
suppose
him
capable
of
having
killed
our
horses
and
bullocks
and
for
what
purpose
is
not
ayrton
s
interest
identical
with
our
own
you
are
right
dear
edward
said
lady
helena
and
what
is
more
the
quartermaster
has
given
us
incontestable
proofs
of
his
devotion
ever
since
the
commencement
of
the
certainly
he
has
replied
mangles
but
still
what
could
the
major
mean
i
wish
he
would
speak
his
mind
plainly
does
he
suppose
him
acting
in
concert
with
the
convicts
asked
paganel
imprudently
what
convicts
said
miss
grant
monsieur
paganel
is
making
a
mistake
replied
john
mangles
instantly
he
knows
very
well
there
are
no
convicts
in
the
province
of
ah
that
is
true
returned
paganel
trying
to
get
out
of
his
unlucky
speech
whatever
had
i
got
in
my
head
convicts
who
ever
heard
of
convicts
being
in
australia
besides
they
would
scarcely
have
disembarked
before
they
would
turn
into
good
honest
men
the
climate
you
know
miss
mary
the
regenerative
climate
here
the
poor
savant
stuck
fast
unable
to
get
further
like
the
wagon
in
the
mud
lady
helena
looked
at
him
in
surprise
which
quite
deprived
him
of
his
remaining
but
seeing
his
embarrassment
she
took
mary
away
to
the
side
of
the
tent
where
olbinett
was
laying
out
an
elaborate
breakfast
i
deserve
to
be
transported
myself
said
paganel
woefully
i
think
so
said
glenarvan
and
after
this
grave
reply
which
completely
overwhelmed
the
worthy
geographer
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
went
toward
the
wagon
they
found
ayrton
and
the
two
sailors
doing
their
best
to
get
it
out
of
the
deep
ruts
and
the
bullock
and
horse
yoked
together
were
straining
every
muscle
wilson
and
mulrady
were
pushing
the
wheels
and
the
quartermaster
urging
on
the
team
with
voice
and
goad
but
the
heavy
vehicle
did
not
stir
the
clay
already
dry
held
it
as
firmly
as
if
sealed
by
some
hydraulic
cement
john
mangles
had
the
clay
watered
to
loosen
it
but
it
was
of
no
use
after
renewed
vigorous
efforts
men
and
animals
stopped
unless
the
vehicle
was
taken
to
pieces
it
would
be
impossible
to
extricate
it
from
the
mud
but
they
had
no
tools
for
the
purpose
and
could
not
attempt
such
a
task
however
ayrton
who
was
for
conquering
this
obstacle
at
all
costs
was
about
to
commence
afresh
when
glenarvan
stopped
him
by
saying
enough
ayrton
enough
we
must
husband
the
strength
of
our
remaining
horse
and
bullock
if
we
are
obliged
to
continue
our
journey
on
foot
the
one
animal
can
carry
the
ladies
and
the
other
the
provisions
they
may
thus
still
be
of
great
service
to
very
well
my
lord
replied
the
quartermaster
the
exhausted
beasts
now
friends
added
glenarvan
let
us
return
to
the
encampment
and
deliberately
examine
our
situation
and
determine
on
our
course
of
after
a
tolerably
good
breakfast
to
make
up
for
their
bad
night
the
discussion
was
opened
and
every
one
of
the
party
was
asked
to
give
his
opinion
the
first
point
was
to
ascertain
their
exact
position
and
this
was
referred
to
paganel
who
informed
them
with
his
customary
rigorous
accuracy
that
the
expedition
had
been
stopped
on
the
parallel
in
longitude
degrees
minutes
on
the
banks
of
the
snowy
river
what
is
the
exact
longitude
of
twofold
bay
asked
glenarvan
one
hundred
and
fifty
degrees
replied
paganel
two
degrees
seven
minutes
distant
from
this
and
that
is
equal
to
and
melbourne
is
two
hundred
miles
off
at
very
good
our
position
being
then
settled
what
is
best
to
do
the
response
was
unanimous
to
get
to
the
coast
without
delay
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
undertook
to
go
five
miles
a
day
the
courageous
ladies
did
not
shrink
if
necessary
from
walking
the
whole
distance
between
the
snowy
river
and
twofold
bay
you
are
a
brave
traveling
companion
dear
helena
said
lord
glenarvan
but
are
we
sure
of
finding
at
the
bay
all
we
want
when
we
get
there
without
the
least
doubt
replied
paganel
eden
is
a
municipality
which
already
numbers
many
years
in
existence
its
port
must
have
frequent
communication
with
melbourne
i
suppose
even
at
delegete
on
the
victoria
frontier
miles
from
here
we
might
revictual
our
expedition
and
find
fresh
means
of
and
the
duncan
asked
ayrton
don
t
you
think
it
advisable
to
send
for
her
to
come
to
the
bay
what
do
you
think
john
said
glenarvan
i
don
t
think
your
lordship
should
be
in
any
hurry
about
it
replied
the
young
captain
after
brief
reflection
there
will
be
time
enough
to
give
orders
to
tom
austin
and
summon
him
to
the
that
s
quite
certain
added
paganel
you
see
said
john
in
four
or
five
days
we
shall
reach
four
or
five
days
repeated
ayrton
shaking
his
head
say
fifteen
or
twenty
captain
if
you
don
t
want
to
repent
your
mistake
when
it
is
too
fifteen
or
twenty
days
to
go
miles
cried
glenarvan
at
the
least
my
lord
you
are
going
to
traverse
the
most
difficult
portion
of
victoria
a
desert
where
everything
is
wanting
the
squatters
say
plains
covered
with
scrub
where
is
no
beaten
track
and
no
stations
you
will
have
to
walk
hatchet
or
torch
in
hand
and
believe
me
that
s
not
quick
ayrton
had
spoken
in
a
firm
tone
and
paganel
at
whom
all
the
others
looked
inquiringly
nodded
his
head
in
token
of
his
agreement
in
opinion
with
the
quartermaster
but
john
mangles
said
well
admitting
these
difficulties
in
fifteen
days
at
most
your
lordship
can
send
orders
to
the
i
have
to
add
said
ayrton
that
the
principal
difficulties
are
not
the
obstacles
in
the
road
but
the
snowy
river
has
to
be
crossed
and
most
probably
we
must
wait
till
the
water
goes
wait
cried
john
is
there
no
ford
i
think
not
replied
ayrton
this
morning
i
was
looking
for
some
practical
crossing
but
could
not
find
any
it
is
unusual
to
meet
with
such
a
tumultuous
river
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
it
is
a
fatality
against
which
i
am
is
this
snowy
river
wide
asked
lady
helena
wide
and
deep
madam
replied
ayrton
a
mile
wide
with
an
impetuous
current
a
good
swimmer
could
not
go
over
without
let
us
build
a
boat
then
said
robert
who
never
stuck
at
anything
we
have
only
to
cut
down
a
tree
and
hollow
it
out
and
get
in
and
be
he
s
going
ahead
this
boy
of
captain
grant
s
said
paganel
and
he
s
right
returned
john
mangles
we
shall
be
forced
to
come
to
that
and
i
think
it
is
useless
to
waste
our
time
in
idle
what
do
you
think
of
it
ayrton
asked
glenarvan
seriously
i
think
my
lord
that
a
month
hence
unless
some
help
arrives
we
shall
find
ourselves
still
on
the
banks
of
the
well
then
have
you
any
better
plan
to
propose
said
john
mangles
somewhat
impatiently
yes
that
the
duncan
should
leave
melbourne
and
go
to
the
east
oh
always
the
same
story
and
how
could
her
presence
at
the
bay
facilitate
our
means
of
getting
there
ayrton
waited
an
instant
before
answering
and
then
said
rather
evasively
i
have
no
wish
to
obtrude
my
opinions
what
i
do
is
for
our
common
good
and
i
am
ready
to
start
the
moment
his
honor
gives
the
and
he
crossed
his
arms
and
was
silent
that
is
no
reply
ayrton
said
glenarvan
tell
us
your
plan
and
we
will
discuss
it
what
is
it
you
propose
ayrton
replied
in
a
calm
tone
of
assurance
i
propose
that
we
should
not
venture
beyond
the
snowy
in
our
present
condition
it
is
here
we
must
wait
till
help
comes
and
this
help
can
only
come
from
the
duncan
let
us
camp
here
where
we
have
provisions
and
let
one
of
us
take
your
orders
to
tom
austin
to
go
on
to
twofold
this
unexpected
proposition
was
greeted
with
astonishment
and
by
john
mangles
with
opposition
meantime
continued
ayrton
either
the
river
will
get
lower
and
allow
us
to
ford
it
or
we
shall
have
time
to
make
a
canoe
this
is
the
plan
i
submit
for
your
lordship
s
well
ayrton
replied
glenarvan
your
plan
is
worthy
of
serious
consideration
the
worst
thing
about
it
is
the
delay
it
would
cause
but
it
would
save
us
great
fatigue
and
perhaps
danger
what
do
you
think
of
it
friends
speak
your
mind
mcnabbs
said
lady
helena
since
the
beginning
of
the
discussion
you
have
been
only
a
listener
and
very
sparing
of
your
since
you
ask
my
advice
said
the
major
i
will
give
it
you
frankly
i
think
ayrton
has
spoken
wisely
and
well
and
i
side
with
such
a
reply
was
hardly
looked
for
as
hitherto
the
major
had
been
strongly
opposed
to
ayrton
s
project
ayrton
himself
was
surprised
and
gave
a
hasty
glance
at
the
major
however
paganel
lady
helena
and
the
sailors
were
all
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
and
since
mcnabbs
had
come
over
to
his
opinion
glenarvan
decided
that
the
quartermaster
s
plan
should
be
adopted
in
principle
and
now
john
he
added
don
t
you
think
yourself
it
would
be
prudent
to
encamp
here
on
the
banks
of
the
river
snowy
till
we
can
get
some
means
of
yes
replied
john
mangles
if
our
messenger
can
get
across
the
snowy
when
we
can
not
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
quartermaster
who
said
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
about
the
messenger
will
not
cross
the
indeed
said
john
mangles
he
will
simply
go
back
to
the
lucknow
road
which
leads
straight
to
go
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
on
foot
cried
the
young
captain
on
horseback
replied
ayrton
there
is
one
horse
sound
enough
at
present
it
will
only
be
an
affair
of
four
days
allow
the
duncan
two
days
more
to
get
to
the
bay
and
twenty
hours
to
get
back
to
the
camp
and
in
a
week
the
messenger
can
be
back
with
the
entire
crew
of
the
the
major
nodded
approvingly
as
ayrton
spoke
to
the
profound
astonishment
of
john
mangles
but
as
every
one
was
in
favor
of
the
plan
all
there
was
to
do
was
to
carry
it
out
as
quickly
as
possible
now
then
friends
said
glenarvan
we
must
settle
who
is
to
be
our
messenger
it
will
be
a
fatiguing
perilous
mission
i
would
not
conceal
the
fact
from
you
who
is
disposed
then
to
sacrifice
himself
for
his
companions
and
carry
our
instructions
to
melbourne
wilson
and
mulrady
and
also
paganel
john
mangles
and
robert
instantly
offered
their
services
john
particularly
insisted
that
he
should
be
intrusted
with
the
business
but
ayrton
who
had
been
silent
till
that
moment
now
said
with
your
honor
s
permission
i
will
go
myself
i
am
accustomed
to
all
the
country
round
many
a
time
i
have
been
across
worse
parts
i
can
go
through
where
another
would
stick
i
ask
then
for
the
good
of
all
that
i
may
be
sent
to
melbourne
a
word
from
you
will
accredit
me
with
your
chief
officer
and
in
six
days
i
guarantee
the
duncan
shall
be
in
twofold
that
s
well
spoken
replied
glenarvan
you
are
a
clever
daring
fellow
and
you
will
it
was
quite
evident
the
quartermaster
was
the
fittest
man
for
the
mission
all
the
rest
withdrew
from
the
competition
john
mangles
made
this
one
last
objection
that
the
presence
of
ayrton
was
necessary
to
discover
traces
of
the
britannia
or
harry
grant
but
the
major
justly
observed
that
the
expedition
would
remain
on
the
banks
of
the
snowy
till
the
return
of
ayrton
that
they
had
no
idea
of
resuming
their
search
without
him
and
that
consequently
his
absence
would
not
in
the
least
prejudice
the
captain
s
interests
well
go
ayrton
said
glenarvan
be
as
quick
as
you
can
and
come
back
by
eden
to
our
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
shot
across
the
quartermaster
s
face
he
turned
away
his
head
but
not
before
john
mangles
caught
the
look
and
instinctively
felt
his
old
distrust
of
ayrton
revive
the
quartermaster
made
immediate
preparations
for
departure
assisted
by
the
two
sailors
one
of
whom
saw
to
the
horse
and
the
other
to
the
provisions
glenarvan
meantime
wrote
his
letter
for
tom
austin
he
ordered
his
chief
officer
to
repair
without
delay
to
twofold
bay
he
introduced
the
quartermaster
to
him
as
a
man
worthy
of
all
confidence
on
arriving
at
the
coast
tom
was
to
dispatch
a
detachment
of
sailors
from
the
yacht
under
his
orders
glenarvan
was
just
at
this
part
of
his
letter
when
mcnabbs
who
was
following
him
with
his
eyes
asked
him
in
a
singular
tone
how
he
wrote
ayrton
s
name
why
as
it
is
pronounced
of
course
replied
glenarvan
it
is
a
mistake
replied
the
major
quietly
he
pronounces
it
ayrton
but
he
writes
it
joyce
chapter
xvii
the
plot
unveiled
the
revelation
of
tom
ayrton
s
name
was
like
a
clap
of
thunder
ayrton
had
started
up
quickly
and
grasped
his
revolver
a
report
was
heard
and
glenarvan
fell
wounded
by
a
ball
gunshots
resounded
at
the
same
time
outside
john
mangles
and
the
sailors
after
their
first
surprise
would
have
seized
ben
joyce
but
the
bold
convict
had
already
disappeared
and
rejoined
his
gang
scattered
among
the
the
tent
was
no
shelter
against
the
balls
it
was
necessary
to
beat
a
retreat
glenarvan
was
slightly
wounded
but
could
stand
up
to
the
wagon
to
the
wagon
cried
john
mangles
dragging
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
along
who
were
soon
in
safety
behind
the
thick
curtains
john
and
the
major
and
paganel
and
the
sailors
seized
their
carbines
in
readiness
to
repulse
the
convicts
glenarvan
and
robert
went
in
beside
the
ladies
while
olbinett
rushed
to
the
common
defense
these
events
occurred
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
john
mangles
watched
the
skirts
of
the
wood
attentively
the
reports
had
ceased
suddenly
on
the
arrival
of
ben
joyce
profound
silence
had
succeeded
the
noisy
fusillade
a
few
wreaths
of
white
smoke
were
still
curling
over
the
tops
of
the
gum
trees
the
tall
tufts
of
gastrolobium
were
motionless
all
signs
of
attack
had
disappeared
the
major
and
john
mangles
examined
the
wood
closely
as
far
as
the
great
trees
the
place
was
abandoned
numerous
footmarks
were
there
and
several
caps
were
lying
smoking
on
the
ground
the
major
like
a
prudent
man
extinguished
these
carefully
for
a
spark
would
be
enough
to
kindle
a
tremendous
conflagration
in
this
forest
of
dry
trees
the
convicts
have
disappeared
said
john
mangles
yes
replied
the
major
and
the
disappearance
of
them
makes
me
uneasy
i
prefer
seeing
them
face
to
face
better
to
meet
a
tiger
on
the
plain
than
a
serpent
in
the
grass
let
us
beat
the
bushes
all
round
the
the
major
and
john
hunted
all
round
the
country
but
there
was
not
a
convict
to
be
seen
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
right
down
to
the
river
ben
joyce
and
his
gang
seemed
to
have
flown
away
like
a
flock
of
marauding
birds
it
was
too
sudden
a
disappearance
to
let
the
travelers
feel
perfectly
safe
consequently
they
resolved
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
the
wagon
a
regular
fortress
buried
in
mud
was
made
the
center
of
the
camp
and
two
men
mounted
guard
round
it
who
were
relieved
hour
by
hour
the
first
care
of
lady
helena
and
mary
was
to
dress
glenarvan
s
wound
lady
helena
rushed
toward
him
in
terror
as
he
fell
down
struck
by
ben
joyce
s
ball
controlling
her
agony
the
courageous
woman
helped
her
husband
into
the
wagon
then
his
shoulder
was
bared
and
the
major
found
on
examination
that
the
ball
had
only
gone
into
the
flesh
and
there
was
no
internal
lesion
neither
bone
nor
muscle
appeared
to
be
injured
the
wound
bled
profusely
but
glenarvan
could
use
his
fingers
and
forearm
and
consequently
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
uneasiness
about
the
issue
as
soon
as
his
shoulder
was
dressed
he
would
not
allow
any
more
fuss
to
be
made
about
himself
but
at
once
entered
on
the
business
in
hand
all
the
party
except
mulrady
and
wilson
who
were
on
guard
were
brought
into
the
wagon
and
the
major
was
asked
to
explain
how
this
denouement
had
come
about
before
commencing
his
recital
he
told
lady
helena
about
the
escape
of
the
convicts
at
perth
and
their
appearance
in
victoria
as
also
their
complicity
in
the
railway
catastrophe
he
handed
her
the
and
new
zealand
they
had
bought
in
seymour
and
added
that
a
reward
had
been
offered
by
the
police
for
the
apprehension
of
ben
joyce
a
redoubtable
bandit
who
had
become
a
noted
character
during
the
last
eighteen
months
for
doing
deeds
of
villainy
and
crime
but
how
had
mcnabbs
found
out
that
ayrton
and
ben
joyce
were
one
and
the
same
individual
this
was
the
mystery
to
be
unraveled
and
the
major
soon
explained
it
ever
since
their
first
meeting
mcnabbs
had
felt
an
instinctive
distrust
of
the
quartermaster
two
or
three
insignificant
facts
a
hasty
glance
exchanged
between
him
and
the
blacksmith
at
the
wimerra
river
his
unwillingness
to
cross
towns
and
villages
his
persistence
about
getting
the
duncan
summoned
to
the
coast
the
strange
death
of
the
animals
entrusted
to
his
care
and
lastly
a
want
of
frankness
in
all
his
behavior
all
these
details
combined
had
awakened
the
major
s
suspicions
however
he
could
not
have
brought
any
direct
accusation
against
him
till
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
had
occurred
he
then
told
of
his
experience
mcnabbs
slipping
between
the
tall
shrubs
got
within
reach
of
the
suspicious
shadows
he
had
noticed
about
half
a
mile
away
from
the
encampment
the
phosphorescent
furze
emitted
a
faint
light
by
which
he
could
discern
three
men
examining
marks
on
the
ground
and
one
of
the
three
was
the
blacksmith
of
black
point
it
is
them
said
one
of
the
men
yes
replied
another
there
is
the
trefoil
on
the
mark
of
the
horseshoe
it
has
been
like
that
since
the
all
the
horses
are
the
poison
is
not
far
there
is
enough
to
kill
a
regiment
of
a
useful
plant
this
i
heard
them
say
this
to
each
other
and
then
they
were
quite
silent
but
i
did
not
know
enough
yet
so
i
followed
them
soon
the
conversation
began
again
he
is
a
clever
fellow
this
ben
joyce
said
the
blacksmith
a
capital
quartermaster
with
his
invention
of
if
his
project
succeeds
it
will
be
a
stroke
of
he
is
a
very
devil
is
this
call
him
ben
joyce
for
he
has
well
earned
his
and
then
the
scoundrels
left
the
forest
i
had
all
the
information
i
wanted
now
and
came
back
to
the
camp
quite
convinced
begging
paganel
s
pardon
that
australia
does
not
reform
this
was
all
the
major
s
story
and
his
companions
sat
silently
thinking
over
it
then
ayrton
has
dragged
us
here
said
glenarvan
pale
with
anger
on
purpose
to
rob
and
assassinate
for
nothing
else
replied
the
major
and
ever
since
we
left
the
wimerra
his
gang
has
been
on
our
track
and
spying
on
us
waiting
for
a
favorable
then
the
wretch
was
never
one
of
the
sailors
on
the
britannia
he
had
stolen
the
name
of
ayrton
and
the
shipping
they
were
all
looking
at
mcnabbs
for
an
answer
for
he
must
have
put
the
question
to
himself
already
there
is
no
great
certainty
about
the
matter
he
replied
in
his
usual
calm
voice
but
in
my
opinion
the
man
s
name
is
really
ayrton
ben
joyce
is
his
de
it
is
an
incontestible
fact
that
he
knew
harry
grant
and
also
that
he
was
quartermaster
on
the
britannia
these
facts
were
proved
by
the
minute
details
given
us
by
ayrton
and
are
corroborated
by
the
conversation
between
the
convicts
which
i
repeated
to
you
we
need
not
lose
ourselves
in
vain
conjectures
but
consider
it
as
certain
that
ben
joyce
is
ayrton
and
that
ayrton
is
ben
joyce
that
is
to
say
one
of
the
crew
of
the
britannia
has
turned
leader
of
the
convict
the
explanations
of
mcnabbs
were
accepted
without
discussion
now
then
said
glenarvan
will
you
tell
us
how
and
why
harry
grant
s
quartermaster
comes
to
be
in
australia
how
i
don
t
know
replied
mcnabbs
and
the
police
declare
they
are
as
ignorant
on
the
subject
as
myself
why
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
is
a
mystery
which
the
future
may
the
police
are
not
even
aware
of
ayrton
s
identity
with
ben
joyce
said
john
mangles
you
are
right
john
replied
the
major
and
this
circumstance
would
throw
light
on
their
then
i
suppose
said
lady
helena
the
wicked
wretch
had
got
work
on
paddy
o
moore
s
farm
with
a
criminal
intent
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
he
was
planning
some
evil
design
against
the
irishman
when
a
better
chance
presented
itself
chance
led
us
into
his
presence
he
heard
paganel
s
story
and
all
about
the
shipwreck
and
the
audacious
fellow
determined
to
act
his
part
immediately
the
expedition
was
decided
on
at
the
wimerra
he
found
means
of
communicating
with
one
of
his
gang
the
blacksmith
of
black
point
and
left
traces
of
our
journey
which
might
be
easily
recognized
the
gang
followed
us
a
poisonous
plant
enabled
them
gradually
to
kill
our
bullocks
and
horses
at
the
right
moment
he
sunk
us
in
the
marshes
of
the
snowy
and
gave
us
into
the
hands
of
his
such
was
the
history
of
ben
joyce
the
major
had
shown
him
up
in
his
character
a
bold
and
formidable
criminal
his
manifestly
evil
designs
called
for
the
utmost
vigilance
on
the
part
of
glenarvan
happily
the
unmasked
bandit
was
less
to
be
feared
than
the
traitor
but
one
serious
consequence
must
come
out
of
this
revelation
no
one
had
thought
of
it
yet
except
mary
grant
john
mangles
was
the
first
to
notice
her
pale
despairing
face
he
understood
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
at
a
glance
miss
mary
miss
mary
he
cried
you
are
crying
crying
my
child
said
lady
helena
my
father
madam
my
father
replied
the
poor
girl
she
could
say
no
more
but
the
truth
flashed
on
every
mind
they
all
knew
the
cause
of
her
grief
and
why
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
and
her
father
s
name
came
to
her
lips
the
discovery
of
ayrton
s
treachery
had
destroyed
all
hope
the
convict
had
invented
a
shipwreck
to
entrap
glenarvan
in
the
conversation
overheard
by
mcnabbs
the
convicts
had
plainly
said
that
the
britannia
had
never
been
wrecked
on
the
rocks
in
twofold
bay
harry
grant
had
never
set
foot
on
the
australian
continent
a
second
time
they
had
been
sent
on
the
wrong
track
by
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
document
gloomy
silence
fell
on
the
whole
party
at
the
sight
of
the
children
s
sorrow
and
no
one
could
find
a
cheering
word
to
say
robert
was
crying
in
his
sister
s
arms
paganel
muttered
in
a
tone
of
vexation
that
unlucky
document
it
may
boast
of
having
a
dozen
peoples
wits
the
worthy
geographer
was
in
such
a
rage
with
himself
that
he
struck
his
forehead
as
if
he
would
smash
it
in
glenarvan
went
out
to
mulrady
and
wilson
who
were
keeping
watch
profound
silence
reigned
over
the
plain
between
the
wood
and
the
river
ben
joyce
and
his
band
must
be
at
considerable
distance
for
the
atmosphere
was
in
such
a
state
of
complete
torpor
that
the
slightest
sound
would
have
been
heard
it
was
evident
from
the
flocks
of
birds
on
the
lower
branches
of
the
trees
and
the
kangaroos
feeding
quietly
on
the
young
shoots
and
a
couple
of
emus
whose
confiding
heads
passed
between
the
great
clumps
of
bushes
that
those
peaceful
solitudes
were
untroubled
by
the
presence
of
human
beings
you
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
for
the
last
hour
said
glenarvan
to
the
two
sailors
nothing
whatever
your
honor
replied
wilson
the
convicts
must
be
miles
away
from
they
were
not
in
numbers
enough
to
attack
us
i
suppose
added
mulrady
ben
joyce
will
have
gone
to
recruit
his
party
with
some
bandits
like
himself
among
the
who
may
be
lurking
about
the
foot
of
the
that
is
probably
the
case
mulrady
replied
glenarvan
the
rascals
are
cowards
they
know
we
are
armed
and
well
armed
too
perhaps
they
are
waiting
for
nightfall
to
commence
the
attack
we
must
redouble
our
watchfulness
oh
if
we
could
only
get
out
of
this
bog
and
down
the
coast
but
this
swollen
river
bars
our
passage
i
would
pay
its
weight
in
gold
for
a
raft
which
would
carry
us
over
to
the
other
why
does
not
your
honor
give
orders
for
a
raft
to
be
constructed
we
have
plenty
of
no
wilson
replied
glenarvan
this
snowy
is
not
a
river
it
is
an
impassable
john
mangles
the
major
and
paganel
just
then
came
out
of
the
wagon
on
purpose
to
examine
the
state
of
the
river
they
found
it
still
so
swollen
by
the
heavy
rain
that
the
water
was
a
foot
above
the
level
it
formed
an
impetuous
current
like
the
american
rapids
to
venture
over
that
foaming
current
and
that
rushing
flood
broken
into
a
thousand
eddies
and
hollows
and
gulfs
was
impossible
john
mangles
declared
the
passage
impracticable
but
we
must
not
stay
here
he
added
without
attempting
anything
what
we
were
going
to
do
before
ayrton
s
treachery
is
still
more
necessary
what
do
you
mean
john
asked
glenarvan
i
mean
that
our
need
is
urgent
and
that
since
we
can
not
go
to
twofold
bay
we
must
go
to
melbourne
we
have
still
one
horse
give
it
to
me
my
lord
and
i
will
go
to
but
that
will
be
a
dangerous
venture
john
said
glenarvan
not
to
speak
of
the
perils
of
a
journey
of
two
hundred
miles
over
an
unknown
country
the
road
and
the
will
be
guarded
by
the
accomplices
of
ben
i
know
it
my
lord
but
i
know
also
that
things
can
t
stay
long
as
they
are
ayrton
only
asked
a
week
s
absence
to
fetch
the
crew
of
the
duncan
and
i
will
be
back
to
the
snowy
river
in
six
days
well
my
lord
what
are
your
commands
before
glenarvan
decides
said
paganel
i
must
make
an
observation
that
some
one
must
go
to
melbourne
is
evident
but
that
john
mangles
should
be
the
one
to
expose
himself
to
the
risk
can
not
be
he
is
the
captain
of
the
duncan
and
must
be
careful
of
his
life
i
will
go
that
is
all
very
well
paganel
said
the
major
but
why
should
you
be
the
one
to
go
are
we
not
here
said
mulrady
and
wilson
and
do
you
think
replied
mcnabbs
that
a
journey
of
two
hundred
miles
on
horseback
frightens
friends
said
glenarvan
one
of
us
must
go
so
let
it
be
decided
by
drawing
lots
write
all
our
names
not
yours
my
lord
said
john
mangles
and
why
not
what
separate
you
from
lady
helena
and
before
your
wound
is
healed
too
glenarvan
said
paganel
you
can
not
leave
the
no
added
the
major
your
place
is
here
edward
you
ought
not
to
danger
is
involved
in
it
said
glenarvan
and
i
will
take
my
share
along
with
the
rest
write
the
names
paganel
and
put
mine
among
them
and
i
hope
the
lot
may
fall
on
his
will
was
obeyed
the
names
were
written
and
the
lots
drawn
fate
fixed
on
mulrady
the
brave
sailor
shouted
hurrah
and
said
my
lord
i
am
ready
to
glenarvan
pressed
his
hand
and
then
went
back
to
the
wagon
leaving
john
mangles
and
the
major
on
watch
lady
helena
was
informed
of
the
determination
to
send
a
message
to
melbourne
and
that
they
had
drawn
lots
who
should
go
and
mulrady
had
been
chosen
lady
helena
said
a
few
kind
words
to
the
brave
sailor
which
went
straight
to
his
heart
fate
could
hardly
have
chosen
a
better
man
for
he
was
not
only
brave
and
intelligent
but
robust
and
superior
to
all
fatigue
mulrady
s
departure
was
fixed
for
eight
o
clock
immediately
after
the
short
twilight
wilson
undertook
to
get
the
horse
ready
he
had
a
project
in
his
head
of
changing
the
horse
s
left
shoe
for
one
off
the
horses
that
had
died
in
the
night
this
would
prevent
the
convicts
from
tracking
mulrady
or
following
him
as
they
were
not
mounted
while
wilson
was
arranging
this
glenarvan
got
his
letter
ready
for
tom
austin
but
his
wounded
arm
troubled
him
and
he
asked
paganel
to
write
it
for
him
the
savant
was
so
absorbed
in
one
fixed
idea
that
he
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
he
was
about
in
all
this
succession
of
vexations
it
must
be
said
the
document
was
always
uppermost
in
paganel
s
mind
he
was
always
worrying
himself
about
each
word
trying
to
discover
some
new
meaning
and
losing
the
wrong
interpretation
of
it
and
going
over
and
over
himself
in
perplexities
he
did
not
hear
glenarvan
when
he
first
spoke
but
on
the
request
being
made
a
second
time
he
said
ah
very
well
i
m
while
he
spoke
he
was
mechanically
getting
paper
from
his
he
tore
a
blank
page
off
and
sat
down
pencil
in
hand
to
write
glenarvan
began
to
dictate
as
follows
order
to
tom
austin
chief
officer
to
get
to
sea
without
delay
and
bring
the
duncan
to
paganel
was
just
finishing
the
last
word
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
on
the
and
new
zealand
lying
on
the
ground
the
paper
was
so
folded
that
only
the
last
two
syllables
of
the
title
were
visible
paganel
s
pencil
stopped
and
he
seemed
to
become
oblivious
of
glenarvan
and
the
letter
entirely
till
his
friends
called
out
come
paganel
ah
said
the
geographer
with
a
loud
exclamation
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
major
nothing
nothing
replied
paganel
then
he
muttered
to
himself
aland
aland
he
had
got
up
and
seized
the
newspaper
he
shook
it
in
his
efforts
to
keep
back
the
words
that
involuntarily
rose
to
his
lips
lady
helena
mary
robert
and
glenarvan
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
unaccountable
agitation
paganel
looked
as
if
a
sudden
fit
of
insanity
had
come
over
him
but
his
excitement
did
not
last
he
became
by
degrees
calmer
the
gleam
of
joy
that
shone
in
his
eyes
died
away
he
sat
down
again
and
said
quietly
when
you
please
my
lord
i
am
glenarvan
resumed
his
dictation
at
once
and
the
letter
was
soon
completed
it
read
as
follows
order
to
tom
austin
to
go
to
sea
without
delay
and
take
the
duncan
to
melbourne
by
the
degree
of
latitude
to
the
eastern
coast
of
of
australia
said
paganel
ah
yes
of
then
he
finished
the
letter
and
gave
it
to
glenarvan
to
sign
who
went
through
the
necessary
formality
as
well
as
he
could
and
closed
and
sealed
the
letter
paganel
whose
hand
still
trembled
with
emotion
directed
it
thus
tom
austin
chief
officer
on
board
the
yacht
duncan
then
he
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
wagon
gesticulating
and
repeating
the
incomprehensible
words
aland
aland
aland
chapter
xviii
four
days
of
anguish
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
on
without
any
further
incident
all
the
preparations
for
mulrady
s
journey
were
completed
and
the
brave
sailor
rejoiced
in
being
able
to
give
his
lordship
this
proof
of
devotion
paganel
had
recovered
his
usual
and
manners
his
look
indeed
betrayed
his
preoccupation
but
he
seemed
resolved
to
keep
it
secret
no
doubt
he
had
strong
reasons
for
this
course
of
action
for
the
major
heard
him
repeating
like
a
man
struggling
with
himself
no
no
they
would
not
believe
it
and
besides
what
good
would
it
be
it
is
too
late
having
taken
this
resolution
he
busied
himself
with
giving
mulrady
the
necessary
directions
for
getting
to
melbourne
and
showed
him
his
way
on
the
map
all
the
tracks
that
is
to
say
paths
through
the
prairie
came
out
on
the
road
to
lucknow
this
road
after
running
right
down
to
the
coast
took
a
sudden
bend
in
the
direction
of
melbourne
this
was
the
route
that
must
be
followed
steadily
for
it
would
not
do
to
attempt
a
short
cut
across
an
almost
unknown
country
nothing
consequently
could
be
more
simple
mulrady
could
not
lose
his
way
as
to
dangers
there
were
none
after
he
had
gone
a
few
miles
beyond
the
encampment
out
of
the
reach
of
ben
joyce
and
his
gang
once
past
their
hiding
place
mulrady
was
certain
of
soon
being
able
to
outdistance
the
convicts
and
execute
his
important
mission
successfully
at
six
o
clock
they
all
dined
together
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
the
tent
was
not
protection
enough
and
the
whole
party
had
to
take
refuge
in
the
wagon
this
was
a
sure
refuge
the
clay
kept
it
firmly
imbedded
in
the
soil
like
a
fortress
resting
on
sure
foundations
the
arsenal
was
composed
of
seven
carbines
and
seven
revolvers
and
could
stand
a
pretty
long
siege
for
they
had
plenty
of
ammunition
and
provisions
but
before
six
days
were
over
the
duncan
would
anchor
in
twofold
bay
and
hours
after
her
crew
would
reach
the
other
shore
of
the
snowy
river
and
should
the
passage
still
remain
impracticable
the
convicts
at
any
rate
would
be
forced
to
retire
before
the
increased
strength
but
all
depended
on
mulrady
s
success
in
his
perilous
enterprise
at
eight
o
clock
it
got
very
dark
now
was
the
time
to
start
the
horse
prepared
for
mulrady
was
brought
out
his
feet
by
way
of
extra
precaution
were
wrapped
round
with
cloths
so
that
they
could
not
make
the
least
noise
on
the
ground
the
animal
seemed
tired
and
yet
the
safety
of
all
depended
on
his
strength
and
surefootedness
the
major
advised
mulrady
to
let
him
go
gently
as
soon
as
he
got
past
the
convicts
better
delay
than
not
arrive
safely
john
mangles
gave
his
sailor
a
revolver
which
he
had
loaded
with
the
utmost
care
this
is
a
formidable
weapon
in
the
hand
of
a
man
who
does
not
tremble
for
six
shots
fired
in
a
few
seconds
would
easily
clear
a
road
infested
with
criminals
mulrady
seated
himself
in
the
saddle
ready
to
start
here
is
the
letter
you
are
to
give
to
tom
austin
said
glenarvan
don
t
let
him
lose
an
hour
he
is
to
sail
for
twofold
bay
at
once
and
if
he
does
not
find
us
there
if
we
have
not
managed
to
cross
the
snowy
let
him
come
on
to
us
without
delay
now
go
my
brave
sailor
and
god
be
with
he
shook
hands
with
him
and
bade
him
and
so
did
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
a
more
timorous
man
than
the
sailor
would
have
shrunk
back
a
little
from
setting
out
on
such
a
dark
raining
night
on
an
errand
so
full
of
danger
across
vast
unknown
wilds
but
his
farewells
were
calmly
spoken
and
he
speedily
disappeared
down
a
path
which
skirted
the
wood
at
the
same
moment
the
gusts
of
wind
redoubled
their
violence
the
high
branches
of
the
eucalyptus
clattered
together
noisily
and
bough
after
bough
fell
on
the
wet
ground
more
than
one
great
tree
with
no
living
sap
but
still
standing
hitherto
fell
with
a
crash
during
this
storm
the
wind
howled
amid
the
cracking
wood
and
mingled
its
moans
with
the
ominous
roaring
of
the
rain
the
heavy
clouds
driving
along
toward
the
east
hung
on
the
ground
like
rays
of
vapor
and
deep
cheerless
gloom
intensified
the
horrors
of
the
night
the
travelers
went
back
into
the
wagon
immediately
mulrady
had
gone
lady
helena
mary
grant
glenarvan
and
paganel
occupied
the
first
compartment
which
had
been
hermetically
closed
the
second
was
occupied
by
olbinett
wilson
and
robert
the
major
and
john
mangles
were
on
duty
outside
this
precaution
was
necessary
for
an
attack
on
the
part
of
the
convicts
would
be
easy
enough
and
therefore
probable
enough
the
two
faithful
guardians
kept
close
watch
bearing
philosophically
the
rain
and
wind
that
beat
on
their
faces
they
tried
to
pierce
through
the
darkness
so
favorable
to
ambushes
for
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
noise
of
the
tempest
the
sough
of
the
wind
the
rattling
branches
falling
trees
and
roaring
of
the
unchained
waters
at
times
the
wind
would
cease
for
a
few
moments
as
if
to
take
breath
nothing
was
audible
but
the
moan
of
the
snowy
river
as
it
flowed
between
the
motionless
reeds
and
the
dark
curtain
of
gum
trees
the
silence
seemed
deeper
in
these
momentary
lulls
and
the
major
and
john
mangles
listened
attentively
during
one
of
these
calms
a
sharp
whistle
reached
them
john
mangles
went
hurriedly
up
to
the
major
you
heard
that
he
asked
yes
said
mcnabbs
is
it
man
or
beast
a
man
replied
john
mangles
and
then
both
listened
the
mysterious
whistle
was
repeated
and
answered
by
a
kind
of
report
but
almost
indistinguishable
for
the
storm
was
raging
with
renewed
violence
mcnabbs
and
john
mangles
could
not
hear
themselves
speak
they
went
for
comfort
under
the
shelter
of
the
wagon
at
this
moment
the
leather
curtains
were
raised
and
glenarvan
rejoined
his
two
companions
he
too
had
heard
this
whistle
and
the
report
which
echoed
under
the
tilt
which
way
was
it
asked
he
there
said
john
pointing
to
the
dark
track
in
the
direction
taken
by
mulrady
how
far
the
wind
brought
it
i
should
think
three
or
four
miles
at
come
said
glenarvan
putting
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
no
said
the
major
it
is
a
decoy
to
get
us
away
from
the
but
if
mulrady
has
even
now
fallen
beneath
the
blows
of
these
rascals
exclaimed
glenarvan
seizing
mcnabbs
by
the
hand
we
shall
know
by
said
the
major
coolly
determined
to
prevent
glenarvan
from
taking
a
step
which
was
equally
rash
and
futile
you
can
not
leave
the
camp
my
lord
said
john
i
will
go
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
cried
mcnabbs
energetically
do
you
want
to
have
us
killed
one
by
one
to
diminish
our
force
and
put
us
at
the
mercy
of
these
wretches
if
mulrady
has
fallen
a
victim
to
them
it
is
a
misfortune
that
must
not
be
repeated
mulrady
was
sent
chosen
by
chance
if
the
lot
had
fallen
to
me
i
should
have
gone
as
he
did
but
i
should
neither
have
asked
nor
expected
in
restraining
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
the
major
was
right
in
every
aspect
of
the
case
to
attempt
to
follow
the
sailor
to
run
in
the
darkness
of
night
among
the
convicts
in
their
leafy
ambush
was
madness
and
more
than
that
it
was
useless
glenarvan
s
party
was
not
so
numerous
that
it
could
afford
to
sacrifice
another
member
of
it
still
glenarvan
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
yield
his
hand
was
always
on
his
carbine
he
wandered
about
the
wagon
and
bent
a
listening
ear
to
the
faintest
sound
the
thought
that
one
of
his
men
was
perhaps
mortally
wounded
abandoned
to
his
fate
calling
in
vain
on
those
for
whose
sake
he
had
gone
forth
was
a
torture
to
him
mcnabbs
was
not
sure
that
he
should
be
able
to
restrain
him
or
if
glenarvan
carried
away
by
his
feelings
would
not
run
into
the
arms
of
ben
joyce
edward
said
he
be
calm
listen
to
me
as
a
friend
think
of
lady
helena
of
mary
grant
of
all
who
are
left
and
besides
where
would
you
go
where
would
you
find
mulrady
he
must
have
been
attacked
two
miles
off
in
what
direction
which
track
would
you
follow
at
that
very
moment
as
if
to
answer
the
major
a
cry
of
distress
was
heard
listen
said
glenarvan
this
cry
came
from
the
same
quarter
as
the
report
but
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
glenarvan
repulsing
mcnabbs
was
already
on
the
track
when
at
three
hundred
paces
from
the
wagon
they
heard
the
exclamation
help
help
the
voice
was
plaintive
and
despairing
john
mangles
and
the
major
sprang
toward
the
spot
a
few
seconds
after
they
perceived
among
the
scrub
a
human
form
dragging
itself
along
the
ground
and
uttering
mournful
groans
it
was
mulrady
wounded
apparently
dying
and
when
his
companions
raised
him
they
felt
their
hands
bathed
in
blood
the
rain
came
down
with
redoubled
violence
and
the
wind
raged
among
the
branches
of
the
dead
trees
in
the
pelting
storm
glenarvan
the
major
and
john
mangles
transported
the
body
of
mulrady
on
their
arrival
everyone
got
up
paganel
robert
wilson
and
olbinett
left
the
wagon
and
lady
helena
gave
up
her
compartment
to
poor
mulrady
the
major
removed
the
poor
fellow
s
flannel
shirt
which
was
dripping
with
blood
and
rain
he
soon
found
the
wound
it
was
a
stab
in
the
right
side
mcnabbs
dressed
it
with
great
skill
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
weapon
had
touched
any
vital
part
an
intermittent
jet
of
scarlet
blood
flowed
from
it
the
patient
s
paleness
and
weakness
showed
that
he
was
seriously
injured
the
major
washed
the
wound
first
with
fresh
water
and
then
closed
the
orifice
after
this
he
put
on
a
thick
pad
of
lint
and
then
folds
of
scraped
linen
held
firmly
in
place
with
a
bandage
he
succeeded
in
stopping
the
hemorrhage
mulrady
was
laid
on
his
side
with
his
head
and
chest
well
raised
and
lady
helena
succeeded
in
making
him
swallow
a
few
drops
of
water
after
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
wounded
man
who
till
then
had
lain
motionless
made
a
slight
movement
his
eyes
unclosed
his
lips
muttered
incoherent
words
and
the
major
bending
toward
him
heard
him
repeating
my
lord
the
letter
ben
the
major
repeated
these
words
and
looked
at
his
companions
what
did
mulrady
mean
ben
joyce
had
been
the
attacking
party
of
course
but
why
surely
for
the
express
purpose
of
intercepting
him
and
preventing
his
arrival
at
the
duncan
this
letter
glenarvan
searched
mulrady
s
pockets
the
letter
addressed
to
tom
austin
was
gone
the
night
wore
away
amid
anxiety
and
distress
every
moment
they
feared
would
be
poor
mulrady
s
last
he
suffered
from
acute
fever
the
sisters
of
charity
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
never
left
him
never
was
patient
so
well
tended
nor
by
such
sympathetic
hands
day
came
and
the
rain
had
ceased
great
clouds
filled
the
sky
still
the
ground
was
strewn
with
broken
branches
the
marly
soil
soaked
by
the
torrents
of
rain
had
yielded
still
more
the
approaches
to
the
wagon
became
difficult
but
it
could
not
sink
any
deeper
john
mangles
paganel
and
glenarvan
went
as
soon
as
it
was
light
enough
to
reconnoiter
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
encampment
they
revisited
the
track
which
was
still
stained
with
blood
they
saw
no
vestige
of
ben
joyce
nor
of
his
band
they
penetrated
as
far
as
the
scene
of
the
attack
here
two
corpses
lay
on
the
ground
struck
down
by
mulrady
s
bullets
one
was
the
blacksmith
of
blackpoint
his
face
already
changed
by
death
was
a
dreadful
spectacle
glenarvan
searched
no
further
prudence
forbade
him
to
wander
from
the
camp
he
returned
to
the
wagon
deeply
absorbed
by
the
critical
position
of
affairs
we
must
not
think
of
sending
another
messenger
to
melbourne
said
he
but
we
must
said
john
mangles
and
i
must
try
to
pass
where
my
sailor
could
not
no
john
it
is
out
of
the
question
you
have
not
even
a
horse
for
the
journey
which
is
full
two
hundred
miles
this
was
true
for
mulrady
s
horse
the
only
one
that
remained
had
not
returned
had
he
fallen
during
the
attack
on
his
rider
or
was
he
straying
in
the
bush
or
had
the
convicts
carried
him
off
come
what
will
replied
glenarvan
we
will
not
separate
again
let
us
wait
a
week
or
a
fortnight
till
the
snowy
falls
to
its
normal
level
we
can
then
reach
twofold
bay
by
short
stages
and
from
there
we
can
send
on
to
the
duncan
by
a
safer
channel
the
order
to
meet
that
seems
the
only
plan
said
paganel
therefore
my
friends
rejoined
glenarvan
no
more
parting
it
is
too
great
a
risk
for
one
man
to
venture
alone
into
a
waste
and
now
may
god
save
our
poor
sailor
and
protect
the
rest
of
us
glenarvan
was
right
in
both
points
first
in
prohibiting
all
isolated
attempts
and
second
in
deciding
to
wait
till
the
passage
of
the
snowy
river
was
practicable
he
was
scarcely
thirty
miles
from
delegete
the
first
frontier
village
of
new
south
wales
where
he
would
easily
find
the
means
of
transport
to
twofold
bay
and
from
there
he
could
telegraph
to
melbourne
his
orders
about
the
duncan
these
measures
were
wise
but
how
late
if
glenarvan
had
not
sent
mulrady
to
lucknow
what
misfortunes
would
have
been
averted
not
to
speak
of
the
assassination
of
the
sailor
when
he
reached
the
camp
he
found
his
companions
in
better
spirits
they
seemed
more
hopeful
than
before
he
is
better
he
is
better
cried
robert
running
out
to
meet
lord
glenarvan
mulrady
yes
edward
answered
lady
helena
a
reaction
has
set
in
the
major
is
more
confident
our
sailor
will
where
is
mcnabbs
asked
glenarvan
with
him
mulrady
wanted
to
speak
to
him
and
they
must
not
be
he
then
learned
that
about
an
hour
since
the
wounded
man
had
awakened
from
his
lethargy
and
the
fever
had
abated
but
the
first
thing
he
did
on
recovering
his
memory
and
speech
was
to
ask
for
lord
glenarvan
or
failing
him
the
major
mcnabbs
seeing
him
so
weak
would
have
forbidden
any
conversation
but
mulrady
insisted
with
such
energy
that
the
major
had
to
give
in
the
interview
had
already
lasted
some
minutes
when
glenarvan
returned
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
await
the
return
of
mcnabbs
presently
the
leather
curtains
of
the
wagon
moved
and
the
major
appeared
he
rejoined
his
friends
at
the
foot
of
a
where
the
tent
was
placed
his
face
usually
so
stolid
showed
that
something
disturbed
him
when
his
eyes
fell
on
lady
helena
and
the
young
girl
his
glance
was
full
of
sorrow
glenarvan
questioned
him
and
extracted
the
following
information
when
he
left
the
camp
mulrady
followed
one
of
the
paths
indicated
by
paganel
he
made
as
good
speed
as
the
darkness
of
the
night
would
allow
he
reckoned
that
he
had
gone
about
two
miles
when
several
men
five
he
thought
sprang
to
his
horse
s
head
the
animal
reared
mulrady
seized
his
revolver
and
fired
he
thought
he
saw
two
of
his
assailants
fall
by
the
flash
he
recognized
ben
joyce
but
that
was
all
he
had
not
time
to
fire
all
the
barrels
he
felt
a
violent
blow
on
his
side
and
was
thrown
to
the
ground
still
he
did
not
lose
consciousness
the
murderers
thought
he
was
dead
he
felt
them
search
his
pockets
and
then
heard
one
of
them
say
i
have
the
give
it
to
me
returned
ben
joyce
and
now
the
duncan
is
at
this
point
of
the
story
glenarvan
could
not
help
uttering
a
cry
mcnabbs
continued
now
you
fellows
added
ben
joyce
catch
the
horse
in
two
days
i
shall
be
on
board
the
duncan
and
in
six
i
shall
reach
twofold
bay
this
is
to
be
the
rendezvous
my
lord
and
his
party
will
be
still
stuck
in
the
marshes
of
the
snowy
river
cross
the
river
at
the
bridge
of
kemple
pier
proceed
to
the
coast
and
wait
for
me
i
will
easily
manage
to
get
you
on
board
once
at
sea
in
a
craft
like
the
duncan
we
shall
be
masters
of
the
indian
hurrah
for
ben
joyce
cried
the
convicts
mulrady
s
horse
was
brought
and
ben
joyce
disappeared
galloping
on
the
lucknow
road
while
the
band
took
the
road
southeast
of
the
snowy
river
mulrady
though
severely
wounded
had
the
strength
to
drag
himself
to
within
three
hundred
paces
from
the
camp
whence
we
found
him
almost
dead
there
said
mcnabbs
is
the
history
of
mulrady
and
now
you
can
understand
why
the
brave
fellow
was
so
determined
to
this
revelation
terrified
glenarvan
and
the
rest
of
the
party
pirates
pirates
cried
glenarvan
my
crew
massacred
my
duncan
in
the
hands
of
these
bandits
yes
for
ben
joyce
will
surprise
the
ship
said
the
major
and
then
well
we
must
get
to
the
coast
first
said
paganel
but
how
are
we
to
cross
the
snowy
river
said
wilson
as
they
will
replied
glenarvan
they
are
to
cross
at
kemple
pier
bridge
and
so
will
but
about
mulrady
asked
lady
helena
we
will
carry
him
we
will
have
relays
can
i
leave
my
crew
to
the
mercy
of
ben
joyce
and
his
gang
to
cross
the
snowy
river
at
kemple
pier
was
practicable
but
dangerous
the
convicts
might
entrench
themselves
at
that
point
and
defend
it
they
were
at
least
thirty
against
seven
but
there
are
moments
when
people
do
not
deliberate
or
when
they
have
no
choice
but
to
go
on
my
lord
said
john
mangles
before
we
throw
away
our
chance
before
venturing
to
this
bridge
we
ought
to
reconnoiter
and
i
will
undertake
i
will
go
with
you
john
said
paganel
this
proposal
was
agreed
to
and
john
mangles
and
paganel
prepared
to
start
immediately
they
were
to
follow
the
course
of
the
snowy
river
follow
its
banks
till
they
reached
the
place
indicated
by
ben
joyce
and
especially
they
were
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
the
convicts
who
were
probably
scouring
the
bush
so
the
two
brave
comrades
started
well
provisioned
and
well
armed
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
as
they
threaded
their
way
among
the
tall
reeds
by
the
river
the
rest
anxiously
awaited
their
return
all
day
evening
came
and
still
the
scouts
did
not
return
they
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
at
last
toward
eleven
o
clock
wilson
announced
their
arrival
paganel
and
john
mangles
were
worn
out
with
the
fatigues
of
a
walk
well
what
about
the
bridge
did
you
find
it
asked
glenarvan
with
impetuous
eagerness
yes
a
bridge
of
said
john
mangles
the
convicts
passed
over
but
but
what
said
glenarvan
who
foreboded
some
new
misfortune
they
burned
it
after
they
passed
said
paganel
chapter
xix
helpless
and
hopeless
it
was
not
a
time
for
despair
but
action
the
bridge
at
kemple
pier
was
destroyed
but
the
snowy
river
must
be
crossed
come
what
might
and
they
must
reach
twofold
bay
before
ben
joyce
and
his
gang
so
instead
of
wasting
time
in
empty
words
the
next
day
the
of
january
john
mangles
and
glenarvan
went
down
to
examine
the
river
and
arrange
for
the
passage
over
the
swollen
and
tumultuous
waters
had
not
gone
down
the
least
they
rushed
on
with
indescribable
fury
it
would
be
risking
life
to
battle
with
them
glenarvan
stood
gazing
with
folded
arms
and
downcast
face
would
you
like
me
to
try
and
swim
across
said
john
mangles
no
john
no
said
lord
glenarvan
holding
back
the
bold
daring
young
fellow
let
us
and
they
both
returned
to
the
camp
the
day
passed
in
the
most
intense
anxiety
ten
times
lord
glenarvan
went
to
look
at
the
river
trying
to
invent
some
bold
way
of
getting
over
but
in
vain
had
a
torrent
of
lava
rushed
between
the
shores
it
could
not
have
been
more
impassable
during
these
long
wasted
hours
lady
helena
under
the
major
s
advice
was
nursing
mulrady
with
the
utmost
skill
the
sailor
felt
a
throb
of
returning
life
mcnabbs
ventured
to
affirm
that
no
vital
part
was
injured
loss
of
blood
accounted
for
the
patient
s
extreme
exhaustion
the
wound
once
closed
and
the
hemorrhage
stopped
time
and
rest
would
be
all
that
was
needed
to
complete
his
cure
lady
helena
had
insisted
on
giving
up
the
first
compartment
of
the
wagon
to
him
which
greatly
tried
his
modesty
the
poor
fellow
s
greatest
trouble
was
the
delay
his
condition
might
cause
glenarvan
and
he
made
him
promise
that
they
should
leave
him
in
the
camp
under
wilson
s
care
should
the
passage
of
the
river
become
practicable
but
unfortunately
no
passage
was
practicable
either
that
day
or
the
next
january
glenarvan
was
in
despair
lady
helena
and
the
major
vainly
tried
to
calm
him
and
preached
patience
patience
indeed
when
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
ben
joyce
was
boarding
the
yacht
when
the
duncan
loosing
from
her
moorings
was
getting
up
steam
to
reach
the
fatal
coast
and
each
hour
was
bringing
her
nearer
john
mangles
felt
in
his
own
breast
all
that
glenarvan
was
suffering
he
determined
to
conquer
the
difficulty
at
any
price
and
constructed
a
canoe
in
the
australian
manner
with
large
sheets
of
bark
of
the
these
sheets
were
kept
together
by
bars
of
wood
and
formed
a
very
fragile
boat
the
captain
and
the
sailor
made
a
trial
trip
in
it
during
the
day
all
that
skill
and
strength
and
tact
and
courage
could
do
they
did
but
they
were
scarcely
in
the
current
before
they
were
upside
down
and
nearly
paid
with
their
lives
for
the
dangerous
experiment
the
boat
disappeared
dragged
down
by
the
eddy
john
mangles
and
wilson
had
not
gone
ten
fathoms
and
the
river
was
a
mile
broad
and
swollen
by
the
heavy
rains
and
melted
snows
thus
passed
the
and
of
january
the
major
and
glenarvan
went
five
miles
up
the
river
in
search
of
a
favorable
passage
but
everywhere
they
found
the
same
roaring
rushing
impetuous
torrent
the
whole
southern
slope
of
the
australian
alps
poured
its
liquid
masses
into
this
single
bed
all
hope
of
saving
the
duncan
was
now
at
an
end
five
days
had
elapsed
since
the
departure
of
ben
joyce
the
yacht
must
be
at
this
moment
at
the
coast
and
in
the
hands
of
the
convicts
however
it
was
impossible
that
this
state
of
things
could
last
the
temporary
influx
would
soon
be
exhausted
and
the
violence
also
indeed
on
the
morning
of
the
paganel
announced
that
the
water
was
already
lower
what
does
it
matter
now
said
glenarvan
it
is
too
late
that
is
no
reason
for
our
staying
longer
here
said
the
major
certainly
not
replied
john
mangles
perhaps
tomorrow
the
river
may
be
and
will
that
save
my
unhappy
men
cried
glenarvan
will
your
lordship
listen
to
me
returned
john
mangles
i
know
tom
austin
he
would
execute
your
orders
and
set
out
as
soon
as
departure
was
possible
but
who
knows
whether
the
duncan
was
ready
and
her
injury
repaired
on
the
arrival
of
ben
joyce
and
suppose
the
yacht
could
not
go
to
sea
suppose
there
was
a
delay
of
a
day
or
two
you
are
right
john
replied
glenarvan
we
must
get
to
twofold
bay
we
are
only
miles
from
yes
added
paganel
and
that
s
a
town
where
we
shall
find
rapid
means
of
conveyance
who
knows
whether
we
shan
t
arrive
in
time
to
prevent
a
let
us
start
cried
glenarvan
john
mangles
and
wilson
instantly
set
to
work
to
construct
a
canoe
of
larger
dimensions
experience
had
proved
that
the
bark
was
powerless
against
the
violence
of
the
torrent
and
john
accordingly
felled
some
of
the
and
made
a
rude
but
solid
raft
with
the
trunks
it
was
a
long
task
and
the
day
had
gone
before
the
work
was
ended
it
was
completed
next
morning
by
this
time
the
waters
had
visibly
diminished
the
torrent
had
once
more
become
a
river
though
a
very
rapid
one
it
is
true
however
by
pursuing
a
zigzag
course
and
overcoming
it
to
a
certain
extent
john
hoped
to
reach
the
opposite
shore
at
twelve
they
embarked
provisions
enough
for
a
couple
of
days
the
remainder
was
left
with
the
wagon
and
the
tent
mulrady
was
doing
well
enough
to
be
carried
over
his
convalescence
was
rapid
at
one
o
clock
they
all
seated
themselves
on
the
raft
still
moored
to
the
shore
john
mangles
had
installed
himself
at
the
starboard
and
entrusted
to
wilson
a
sort
of
oar
to
steady
the
raft
against
the
current
and
lessen
the
leeway
he
took
his
own
stand
at
the
back
to
steer
by
means
of
a
large
scull
but
notwithstanding
their
efforts
wilson
and
john
mangles
soon
found
themselves
in
an
inverse
position
which
made
the
action
of
the
oars
impossible
there
was
no
help
for
it
they
could
do
nothing
to
arrest
the
gyratory
movement
of
the
raft
it
turned
round
with
dizzying
rapidity
and
drifted
out
of
its
course
john
mangles
stood
with
pale
face
and
set
teeth
gazing
at
the
whirling
current
however
the
raft
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
about
half
a
mile
from
the
starting
point
here
the
current
was
extremely
strong
and
this
broke
the
whirling
eddy
and
gave
the
raft
some
stability
john
and
wilson
seized
their
oars
again
and
managed
to
push
it
in
an
oblique
direction
this
brought
them
nearer
to
the
left
shore
they
were
not
more
than
fifty
fathoms
from
it
when
wilson
s
oar
snapped
short
off
and
the
raft
no
longer
supported
was
dragged
away
john
tried
to
resist
at
the
risk
of
breaking
his
own
oar
too
and
wilson
with
bleeding
hands
seconded
his
efforts
with
all
his
might
at
last
they
succeeded
and
the
raft
after
a
passage
of
more
than
half
an
hour
struck
against
the
steep
bank
of
the
opposite
shore
the
shock
was
so
violent
that
the
logs
became
disunited
the
cords
broke
and
the
water
bubbled
up
between
the
travelers
had
barely
time
to
catch
hold
of
the
steep
bank
they
dragged
out
mulrady
and
the
two
dripping
ladies
everyone
was
safe
but
the
provisions
and
firearms
except
the
carbine
of
the
major
went
drifting
down
with
the
debris
of
the
raft
the
river
was
crossed
the
little
company
found
themselves
almost
without
provisions
miles
from
delegete
in
the
midst
of
the
unknown
deserts
of
the
victoria
frontier
neither
settlers
nor
squatters
were
to
be
met
with
it
was
entirely
uninhabited
unless
by
ferocious
bushrangers
and
bandits
they
resolved
to
set
off
without
delay
mulrady
saw
clearly
that
he
would
be
a
great
drag
on
them
and
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
and
even
to
remain
alone
till
assistance
could
be
sent
from
delegete
glenarvan
refused
it
would
be
three
days
before
he
could
reach
delegete
and
five
the
shore
that
is
to
say
the
of
january
now
as
the
duncan
had
left
melbourne
on
the
what
difference
would
a
few
days
delay
make
no
my
friend
he
said
i
will
not
leave
anyone
behind
we
will
make
a
litter
and
carry
you
in
the
litter
was
made
of
boughs
of
eucalyptus
covered
with
branches
and
whether
he
would
or
not
mulrady
was
obliged
to
take
his
place
on
it
glenarvan
would
be
the
first
to
carry
his
sailor
he
took
hold
of
one
end
and
wilson
of
the
other
and
all
set
off
what
a
sad
spectacle
and
how
lamentably
was
this
expedition
to
end
which
had
commenced
so
well
they
were
no
longer
in
search
of
harry
grant
this
continent
where
he
was
not
and
never
had
been
threatened
to
prove
fatal
to
those
who
sought
him
and
when
these
intrepid
countrymen
of
his
should
reach
the
shore
they
would
find
the
duncan
waiting
to
take
them
home
again
the
first
day
passed
silently
and
painfully
every
ten
minutes
the
litter
changed
bearers
all
the
sailor
s
comrades
took
their
share
in
this
task
without
murmuring
though
the
fatigue
was
augmented
by
the
great
heat
in
the
evening
after
a
journey
of
only
five
miles
they
camped
under
the
the
small
store
of
provisions
saved
from
the
raft
composed
the
evening
meal
but
all
they
had
to
depend
upon
now
was
the
major
s
carbine
it
was
a
dark
rainy
night
and
morning
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
dawn
they
set
off
again
but
the
major
could
not
find
a
chance
of
firing
a
shot
this
fatal
region
was
only
a
desert
unfrequented
even
by
animals
fortunately
robert
discovered
a
bustard
s
nest
with
a
dozen
of
large
eggs
in
it
which
olbinett
cooked
on
hot
cinders
these
with
a
few
roots
of
purslain
which
were
growing
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
were
all
the
breakfast
of
the
the
route
now
became
extremely
difficult
the
sandy
plains
were
bristling
with
spinifex
a
prickly
plant
which
is
called
in
melbourne
the
porcupine
it
tears
the
clothing
to
rags
and
makes
the
legs
bleed
the
courageous
ladies
never
complained
but
footed
it
bravely
setting
an
example
and
encouraging
one
and
another
by
word
or
look
they
stopped
in
the
evening
at
mount
bulla
bulla
on
the
edge
of
the
jungalla
creek
the
supper
would
have
been
very
scant
if
mcnabbs
had
not
killed
a
large
rat
the
which
is
highly
spoken
of
as
an
article
of
diet
olbinett
roasted
it
and
it
would
have
been
pronounced
even
superior
to
its
reputation
had
it
equaled
the
sheep
in
size
they
were
obliged
to
be
content
with
it
however
and
it
was
devoured
to
the
bones
on
the
the
weary
but
still
energetic
travelers
started
off
again
after
having
gone
round
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
crossed
the
long
prairies
where
the
grass
seemed
made
of
whalebone
it
was
a
tangle
of
darts
a
medley
of
sharp
little
sticks
and
a
path
had
to
be
cut
through
either
with
the
hatchet
or
fire
that
morning
there
was
not
even
a
question
of
breakfast
nothing
could
be
more
barren
than
this
region
strewn
with
pieces
of
quartz
not
only
hunger
but
thirst
began
to
assail
the
travelers
a
burning
atmosphere
heightened
their
discomfort
glenarvan
and
his
friends
could
only
go
half
a
mile
an
hour
should
this
lack
of
food
and
water
continue
till
evening
they
would
all
sink
on
the
road
never
to
rise
again
but
when
everything
fails
a
man
and
he
finds
himself
without
resources
at
the
very
moment
when
he
feels
he
must
give
up
then
providence
steps
in
water
presented
itself
in
the
cephalotes
a
species
of
flower
filled
with
refreshing
liquid
which
hung
from
the
branches
of
bushes
they
all
quenched
their
thirst
with
these
and
felt
new
life
returning
the
only
food
they
could
find
was
the
same
as
the
natives
were
forced
to
subsist
upon
when
they
could
find
neither
game
nor
serpents
nor
insects
paganel
discovered
in
the
dry
bed
of
a
creek
a
plant
whose
excellent
properties
had
been
frequently
described
by
one
of
his
colleagues
in
the
geographical
society
it
was
the
nardou
a
cryptogamous
plant
of
the
family
marsilacea
and
the
same
which
kept
burke
and
king
alive
in
the
deserts
of
the
interior
under
its
leaves
which
resembled
those
of
the
trefoil
there
were
dried
sporules
as
large
as
a
lentil
and
these
sporules
when
crushed
between
two
stones
made
a
sort
of
flour
this
was
converted
into
coarse
bread
which
stilled
the
pangs
of
hunger
at
least
there
was
a
great
abundance
of
this
plant
growing
in
the
district
and
olbinett
gathered
a
large
supply
so
that
they
were
sure
of
food
for
several
days
the
next
day
the
mulrady
was
able
to
walk
part
of
the
way
his
wound
was
entirely
cicatrized
the
town
of
delegete
was
not
more
than
ten
miles
off
and
that
evening
they
camped
in
longitude
degrees
on
the
very
frontier
of
new
south
wales
for
some
hours
a
fine
but
penetrating
rain
had
been
falling
there
would
have
been
no
shelter
from
this
if
by
chance
john
mangles
had
not
discovered
a
sawyer
s
hut
deserted
and
dilapidated
to
a
degree
but
with
this
miserable
cabin
they
were
obliged
to
be
content
wilson
wanted
to
kindle
a
fire
to
prepare
the
nardou
bread
and
he
went
out
to
pick
up
the
dead
wood
scattered
all
over
the
ground
but
he
found
it
would
not
light
the
great
quantity
of
albuminous
matter
which
it
contained
prevented
all
combustion
this
is
the
incombustible
wood
put
down
by
paganel
in
his
list
of
australian
products
they
had
to
dispense
with
fire
and
consequently
with
food
too
and
sleep
in
their
wet
clothes
while
the
laughing
jackasses
concealed
in
the
high
branches
seemed
to
ridicule
the
poor
unfortunates
however
glenarvan
was
nearly
at
the
end
of
his
sufferings
it
was
time
the
two
young
ladies
were
making
heroic
efforts
but
their
strength
was
hourly
decreasing
they
dragged
themselves
along
almost
unable
to
walk
next
morning
they
started
at
daybreak
at
delegete
came
in
sight
in
the
county
of
wellesley
and
fifty
miles
from
twofold
bay
means
of
conveyance
were
quickly
procured
here
hope
returned
to
glenarvan
as
they
approached
the
coast
perhaps
there
might
have
been
some
slight
delay
and
after
all
they
might
get
there
before
the
arrival
of
the
duncan
in
hours
they
would
reach
the
bay
at
noon
after
a
comfortable
meal
all
the
travelers
installed
in
a
drawn
by
five
strong
horses
left
delegete
at
a
gallop
the
postilions
stimulated
by
a
promise
of
a
princely
douceur
drove
rapidly
along
over
a
road
they
did
not
lose
a
minute
in
changing
horses
which
took
place
every
ten
miles
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
infected
with
glenarvan
s
zeal
all
that
day
and
night
too
they
traveled
on
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
an
hour
in
the
morning
at
sunrise
a
dull
murmur
fell
on
their
ears
and
announced
their
approach
to
the
indian
ocean
they
required
to
go
round
the
bay
to
gain
the
coast
at
the
parallel
the
exact
point
where
tom
austin
was
to
wait
their
arrival
when
the
sea
appeared
all
eyes
anxiously
gazed
at
the
offing
was
the
duncan
by
a
miracle
of
providence
there
running
close
to
the
shore
as
a
month
ago
when
they
crossed
cape
corrientes
they
had
found
her
on
the
argentine
coast
they
saw
nothing
sky
and
earth
mingled
in
the
same
horizon
not
a
sail
enlivened
the
vast
stretch
of
ocean
one
hope
still
remained
perhaps
tom
austin
had
thought
it
his
duty
to
cast
anchor
in
twofold
bay
for
the
sea
was
heavy
and
a
ship
would
not
dare
to
venture
near
the
shore
to
eden
cried
glenarvan
immediately
the
resumed
the
route
round
the
bay
toward
the
little
town
of
eden
five
miles
distant
the
postilions
stopped
not
far
from
the
lighthouse
which
marks
the
entrance
of
the
port
several
vessels
were
moored
in
the
roadstead
but
none
of
them
bore
the
flag
of
malcolm
glenarvan
john
mangles
and
paganel
got
out
of
the
coach
and
rushed
to
the
to
inquire
about
the
arrival
of
vessels
within
the
last
few
days
no
ship
had
touched
the
bay
for
a
week
perhaps
the
yacht
has
not
started
glenarvan
said
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
lifting
him
from
despair
perhaps
we
have
arrived
john
mangles
shook
his
head
he
knew
tom
austin
his
first
mate
would
not
delay
the
execution
of
an
order
for
ten
days
i
must
know
at
all
events
how
they
stand
said
glenarvan
better
certainty
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
a
telegram
was
sent
to
the
syndicate
of
shipbrokers
in
melbourne
the
whole
party
then
repaired
to
the
victoria
hotel
at
the
following
telegraphic
reply
was
received
lord
glenarvan
eden

the
duncan
left
on

current
destination
unknown
andrews
the
telegram
dropped
from
glenarvan
s
hands
there
was
no
doubt
now
the
good
honest
scotch
yacht
was
now
a
pirate
ship
in
the
hands
of
ben
joyce
so
ended
this
journey
across
australia
which
had
commenced
under
circumstances
so
favorable
all
trace
of
captain
grant
and
his
shipwrecked
men
seemed
to
be
irrevocably
lost
this
ill
success
had
cost
the
loss
of
a
ship
s
crew
lord
glenarvan
had
been
vanquished
in
the
strife
and
the
courageous
searchers
whom
the
unfriendly
elements
of
the
pampas
had
been
unable
to
check
had
been
conquered
on
the
australian
shore
by
the
perversity

i
a
rough
captain
if
ever
the
searchers
after
captain
grant
were
tempted
to
despair
surely
it
was
at
this
moment
when
all
their
hopes
were
destroyed
at
a
blow
toward
what
quarter
of
the
world
should
they
direct
their
endeavors
how
were
they
to
explore
new
countries
the
duncan
was
no
longer
available
and
even
an
immediate
return
to
their
own
land
was
out
of
the
question
thus
the
enterprise
of
these
generous
scots
had
failed
failed
a
despairing
word
that
finds
no
echo
in
a
brave
soul
and
yet
under
the
repeated
blows
of
adverse
fate
glenarvan
himself
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
his
inability
to
prosecute
his
devoted
efforts
mary
grant
at
this
crisis
nerved
herself
to
the
resolution
never
to
utter
the
name
of
her
father
she
suppressed
her
own
anguish
when
she
thought
of
the
unfortunate
crew
who
had
perished
the
daughter
was
merged
in
the
friend
and
she
now
took
upon
her
to
console
lady
glenarvan
who
till
now
had
been
her
faithful
comforter
she
was
the
first
to
speak
of
returning
to
scotland
john
mangles
was
filled
with
admiration
at
seeing
her
so
courageous
and
so
resigned
he
wanted
to
say
a
word
further
in
the
captain
s
interest
but
mary
stopped
him
with
a
glance
and
afterward
said
to
him
no
john
we
must
think
of
those
who
ventured
their
lives
lord
glenarvan
must
return
to
europe
you
are
right
miss
mary
answered
john
mangles
he
must
beside
the
english
authorities
must
be
informed
of
the
fate
of
the
duncan
but
do
not
despair
rather
than
abandon
our
search
i
will
resume
it
alone
i
will
either
find
captain
grant
or
perish
in
the
attempt
it
was
a
serious
undertaking
to
which
john
mangles
bound
himself
mary
accepted
and
gave
her
hand
to
the
young
captain
as
if
to
ratify
the
treaty
on
john
mangles
side
it
was
a
life
s
devotion
on
mary
s
undying
gratitude
during
that
day
their
departure
was
finally
arranged
they
resolved
to
reach
melbourne
without
delay
next
day
john
went
to
inquire
about
the
ships
ready
to
sail
he
expected
to
find
frequent
communication
between
eden
and
victoria
he
was
disappointed
ships
were
scarce
three
or
four
vessels
anchored
in
twofold
bay
constituted
the
mercantile
fleet
of
the
place
none
of
them
were
bound
for
melbourne
nor
sydney
nor
point
de
galle
at
any
of
which
ports
glenarvan
would
have
found
ships
loading
for
england
in
fact
the
peninsular
and
oriental
company
has
a
regular
line
of
packets
between
these
points
and
england
under
these
circumstances
what
was
to
be
done
waiting
for
a
ship
might
be
a
tedious
affair
for
twofold
bay
is
not
much
frequented
numbers
of
ships
pass
by
without
touching
after
due
reflection
and
discussion
glenarvan
had
nearly
decided
to
follow
the
coast
road
to
sydney
when
paganel
made
an
unexpected
proposition
the
geographer
had
visited
twofold
bay
on
his
own
account
and
was
aware
that
there
were
no
means
of
transport
for
sydney
or
melbourne
but
of
the
three
vessels
anchored
in
the
roadstead
one
was
loading
for
auckland
the
capital
of
the
northern
island
of
new
zealand
paganel
s
proposal
was
to
take
the
ship
in
question
and
get
to
auckland
whence
it
would
be
easy
to
return
to
europe
by
the
boats
of
the
peninsular
and
oriental
company
this
proposition
was
taken
into
serious
consideration
paganel
on
this
occasion
dispensed
with
the
volley
of
arguments
he
generally
indulged
in
he
confined
himself
to
the
bare
proposition
adding
that
the
voyage
to
new
zealand
was
only
five
or
six
days
the
distance
in
fact
being
only
about
a
thousand
miles
by
a
singular
coincidence
auckland
is
situated
on
the
parallel
the
which
the
explorers
had
perseveringly
followed
since
they
left
the
coast
of
araucania
paganel
might
fairly
have
used
this
as
an
argument
in
favor
of
his
scheme
in
fact
it
was
a
natural
opportunity
of
visiting
the
shores
of
new
zealand
but
paganel
did
not
lay
stress
on
this
argument
after
two
mistakes
he
probably
hesitated
to
attempt
a
third
interpretation
of
the
document
besides
what
could
he
make
of
it
it
said
positively
that
a
continent
had
served
as
a
refuge
for
captain
grant
not
an
island
now
new
zealand
was
nothing
but
an
island
this
seemed
decisive
whether
for
this
reason
or
for
some
other
paganel
did
not
connect
any
idea
of
further
search
with
this
proposition
of
reaching
auckland
he
merely
observed
that
regular
communication
existed
between
that
point
and
great
britain
and
that
it
was
easy
to
take
advantage
of
it
john
mangles
supported
paganel
s
proposal
he
advised
its
adoption
as
it
was
hopeless
to
await
the
problematical
arrival
of
a
vessel
in
twofold
bay
but
before
coming
to
any
decision
he
thought
it
best
to
visit
the
ship
mentioned
by
the
geographer
glenarvan
the
major
paganel
robert
and
mangles
himself
took
a
boat
and
a
few
strokes
brought
them
alongside
the
ship
anchored
two
cables
length
from
the
quay
it
was
a
brig
of
tons
named
the
macquarie
it
was
engaged
in
the
coasting
trade
between
the
various
ports
of
australia
and
new
zealand
the
captain
or
rather
the
master
received
his
visitors
gruffly
enough
they
perceived
that
they
had
to
do
with
a
man
of
no
education
and
whose
manners
were
in
no
degree
superior
to
those
of
the
five
sailors
of
his
crew
with
a
coarse
red
face
thick
hands
and
a
broken
nose
blind
of
an
eye
and
his
lips
stained
with
the
pipe
will
halley
was
a
sadly
brutal
looking
person
but
they
had
no
choice
and
for
so
short
a
voyage
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
very
particular
what
do
you
want
asked
will
halley
when
the
strangers
stepped
on
the
poop
of
his
ship
the
captain
answered
john
mangles
i
am
the
captain
said
halley
what
else
do
you
want
the
macquarie
is
loading
for
auckland
i
believe
yes
what
else
what
does
she
carry
everything
salable
and
purchasable
what
else
when
does
she
sail
at
the
tide
what
else
does
she
take
passengers
that
depends
on
who
the
passengers
are
and
whether
they
are
satisfied
with
the
ship
s
they
would
bring
their
own
what
else
what
else
yes
how
many
are
there
nine
two
of
them
are
i
have
no
we
will
manage
with
such
space
as
may
be
left
at
their
what
else
do
you
agree
said
john
mangles
who
was
not
in
the
least
put
out
by
the
captain
s
peculiarities
we
ll
see
said
the
master
of
the
macquarie
will
halley
took
two
or
three
turns
on
the
poop
making
it
resound
with
boots
and
then
he
turned
abruptly
to
john
mangles
what
would
you
pay
said
he
what
do
you
ask
replied
john
fifty
glenarvan
looked
consent
very
good
fifty
pounds
replied
john
mangles
but
passage
only
added
halley
yes
passage
food
agreed
and
now
said
will
putting
out
his
hand
what
about
the
deposit
money
here
is
half
of
the
pounds
said
mangles
counting
out
the
sum
to
the
master
all
aboard
said
he
before
noon
whether
or
no
i
weigh
we
will
be
this
said
glenarvan
the
major
robert
paganel
and
john
mangles
left
the
ship
halley
not
so
much
as
touching
the
oilskin
that
adorned
his
red
locks
what
a
brute
exclaimed
john
he
will
do
answered
paganel
he
is
a
regular
a
downright
bear
added
the
major
i
fancy
said
john
mangles
that
the
said
bear
has
dealt
in
human
flesh
in
his
what
matter
answered
glenarvan
as
long
as
he
commands
the
macquarie
and
the
macquarie
goes
to
new
zealand
from
twofold
bay
to
auckland
we
shall
not
see
much
of
him
after
auckland
we
shall
see
him
no
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
were
delighted
to
hear
that
their
departure
was
arranged
for
glenarvan
warned
them
that
the
macquarie
was
inferior
in
comfort
to
the
duncan
but
after
what
they
had
gone
through
they
were
indifferent
to
trifling
annoyances
wilson
was
told
off
to
arrange
the
accommodation
on
board
the
macquarie
under
his
busy
brush
and
broom
things
soon
changed
their
aspect
will
halley
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
let
the
sailor
have
his
way
glenarvan
and
his
party
gave
him
no
concern
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
to
know
their
names
his
new
freight
represented
fifty
pounds
and
he
rated
it
far
below
the
two
hundred
tons
of
cured
hides
which
were
stowed
away
in
his
hold
skins
first
men
after
he
was
a
merchant
as
to
his
sailor
qualification
he
was
said
to
be
skillful
enough
in
navigating
these
seas
whose
reefs
make
them
very
dangerous
as
the
day
drew
to
a
close
glenarvan
had
a
desire
to
go
again
to
the
point
on
the
coast
cut
by
the
parallel
two
motives
prompted
him
he
wanted
to
examine
once
more
the
presumed
scene
of
the
wreck
ayrton
had
certainly
been
quartermaster
on
the
britannia
and
the
britannia
might
have
been
lost
on
this
part
of
the
australian
coast
on
the
east
coast
if
not
on
the
west
it
would
not
do
to
leave
without
thorough
investigation
a
locality
which
they
were
never
to
revisit
and
then
failing
the
britannia
the
duncan
certainly
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
convicts
perhaps
there
had
been
a
fight
there
might
yet
be
found
on
the
coast
traces
of
a
struggle
a
last
resistance
if
the
crew
had
perished
among
the
waves
the
waves
probably
had
thrown
some
bodies
on
the
shore
glenarvan
accompanied
by
his
faithful
john
went
to
carry
out
the
final
search
the
landlord
of
the
victoria
hotel
lent
them
two
horses
and
they
set
out
on
the
northern
road
that
skirts
twofold
bay
it
was
a
melancholy
journey
glenarvan
and
captain
john
trotted
along
without
speaking
but
they
understood
each
other
the
same
thoughts
the
same
anguish
harrowed
both
their
hearts
they
looked
at
the
rocks
they
needed
no
words
of
question
or
answer
john
s
zeal
and
intelligence
were
a
guarantee
that
every
point
was
scrupulously
examined
the
least
likely
places
as
well
as
the
sloping
beaches
and
sandy
plains
where
even
the
slight
tides
of
the
pacific
might
have
thrown
some
fragments
of
wreck
but
no
indication
was
seen
that
could
suggest
further
search
in
that
quarter
all
trace
of
the
wreck
escaped
them
still
as
to
the
duncan
no
trace
either
all
that
part
of
australia
bordering
the
ocean
was
desert
still
john
mangles
discovered
on
the
skirts
of
the
shore
evident
traces
of
camping
remains
of
fires
recently
kindled
under
solitary
had
a
tribe
of
wandering
blacks
passed
that
way
lately
no
for
glenarvan
saw
a
token
which
furnished
incontestable
proof
that
the
convicts
had
frequented
that
part
of
the
coast
this
token
was
a
grey
and
yellow
garment
worn
and
patched
an
rag
thrown
down
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
it
bore
the
convict
s
original
number
at
the
perth
penitentiary
the
felon
was
not
there
but
his
filthy
garments
betrayed
his
passage
this
livery
of
crime
after
having
clothed
some
miscreant
was
now
decaying
on
this
desert
shore
you
see
john
said
glenarvan
the
convicts
got
as
far
as
here
and
our
poor
comrades
of
the
duncan
yes
said
john
in
a
low
voice
they
never
landed
they
perished
those
wretches
cried
glenarvan
if
ever
they
fall
into
my
hands
i
will
avenge
my
crew
grief
had
hardened
glenarvan
s
features
for
some
minutes
he
gazed
at
the
expanse
before
him
as
if
taking
a
last
look
at
some
ship
disappearing
in
the
distance
then
his
eyes
became
dim
he
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
and
without
a
word
or
look
set
off
at
a
gallop
toward
eden
the
wanderers
passed
their
last
evening
sadly
enough
their
thoughts
recalled
all
the
misfortunes
they
had
encountered
in
this
country
they
remembered
how
full
of
hope
they
had
been
at
cape
bernouilli
and
how
cruelly
disappointed
at
twofold
bay
paganel
was
full
of
feverish
agitation
john
mangles
who
had
watched
him
since
the
affair
at
snowy
river
felt
that
the
geographer
was
hesitating
whether
to
speak
or
not
to
speak
a
thousand
times
he
had
pressed
him
with
questions
and
failed
in
obtaining
an
answer
but
that
evening
john
in
lighting
him
to
his
room
asked
him
why
he
was
so
nervous
friend
john
said
paganel
evasively
i
am
not
more
nervous
than
i
always
mr
paganel
answered
john
you
have
a
secret
that
chokes
well
cried
the
geographer
gesticulating
what
can
i
do
it
is
stronger
than
i
what
is
stronger
my
joy
on
the
one
hand
my
despair
on
the
you
rejoice
and
despair
at
the
same
time
yes
at
the
idea
of
visiting
new
why
have
you
any
trace
asked
john
eagerly
have
you
recovered
the
lost
tracks
no
friend
john
no
one
returns
from
new
zealand
but
still
you
know
human
nature
all
we
want
to
nourish
hope
is
breath
my
device
is
and
it
is
the
best
motto
in

chapter
ii
navigators
and
their
discoveries
next
day
the
of
january
the
passengers
of
the
macquarie
were
installed
on
board
the
brig
will
halley
had
not
offered
his
cabin
to
his
lady
passengers
this
omission
was
the
less
to
be
deplored
for
the
den
was
worthy
of
the
bear
at
half
past
twelve
the
anchor
was
weighed
having
been
loosed
from
its
with
some
difficulty
a
moderate
breeze
was
blowing
from
the
southwest
the
sails
were
gradually
unfurled
the
five
hands
made
slow
work
wilson
offered
to
assist
the
crew
but
halley
begged
him
to
be
quiet
and
not
to
interfere
with
what
did
not
concern
him
he
was
accustomed
to
manage
his
own
affairs
and
required
neither
assistance
nor
advice
this
was
aimed
at
john
mangles
who
had
smiled
at
the
clumsiness
of
some
maneuver
john
took
the
hint
but
mentally
resolved
that
he
would
nevertheless
hold
himself
in
readiness
in
case
the
incapacity
of
the
crew
should
endanger
the
safety
of
the
vessel
however
in
time
the
sails
were
adjusted
by
the
five
sailors
aided
by
the
stimulus
of
the
captain
s
oaths
the
macquarie
stood
out
to
sea
on
the
larboard
tack
under
all
her
lower
sails
topsails
topgallants
and
jib
by
and
by
the
other
sails
were
hoisted
but
in
spite
of
this
additional
canvas
the
brig
made
very
little
way
her
rounded
bow
the
width
of
her
hold
and
her
heavy
stern
made
her
a
bad
sailor
the
perfect
type
of
a
wooden
shoe
they
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
happily
five
days
or
at
most
six
would
take
them
to
auckland
no
matter
how
bad
a
sailor
the
macquarie
was
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
australian
coast
and
the
lighthouse
of
the
port
of
eden
had
faded
out
of
sight
the
ship
labored
on
the
lumpy
sea
and
rolled
heavily
in
the
trough
of
the
waves
the
passengers
below
suffered
a
good
deal
from
this
motion
but
it
was
impossible
to
stay
on
deck
as
it
rained
violently
thus
they
were
condemned
to
close
imprisonment
each
one
of
them
was
lost
in
his
own
reflections
words
were
few
now
and
then
lady
helena
and
miss
grant
exchanged
a
few
syllables
glenarvan
was
restless
he
went
in
and
out
while
the
major
was
impassive
john
mangles
followed
by
robert
went
on
the
poop
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
the
weather
paganel
sat
in
his
corner
muttering
vague
and
incoherent
words
what
was
the
worthy
geographer
thinking
of
of
new
zealand
the
country
to
which
destiny
was
leading
him
he
went
mentally
over
all
his
history
he
called
to
mind
the
scenes
of
the
past
in
that
country
but
in
all
that
history
was
there
a
fact
was
there
a
solitary
incident
that
could
justify
the
discoverers
of
these
islands
in
considering
them
as
a
could
a
modern
geographer
or
a
sailor
concede
to
them
such
a
designation
paganel
was
always
revolving
the
meaning
of
the
document
he
was
possessed
with
the
idea
it
became
his
ruling
thought
after
patagonia
after
australia
his
imagination
allured
by
a
name
flew
to
new
zealand
but
in
that
direction
one
point
and
only
one
stood
in
his
way
he
repeated
that
must
mean
continent
and
then
he
resumed
his
mental
retrospect
of
the
navigators
who
made
known
to
us
these
two
great
islands
of
the
southern
sea
it
was
on
the
of
december
that
the
dutch
navigator
tasman
after
discovering
van
diemen
s
land
sighted
the
unknown
shores
of
new
zealand
he
coasted
along
for
several
days
and
on
the
of
december
his
ships
penetrated
into
a
large
bay
which
terminating
in
a
narrow
strait
separated
the
two
islands
the
northern
island
was
called
by
the
natives
a
word
which
signifies
the
fish
of
mani
the
southern
island
was
called
the
whale
that
yields
the
abel
tasman
sent
his
boats
on
shore
and
they
returned
accompanied
by
two
canoes
and
a
noisy
company
of
natives
these
savages
were
middle
height
of
brown
or
yellow
complexion
angular
bones
harsh
voices
and
black
hair
which
was
dressed
in
the
japanese
manner
and
surmounted
by
a
tall
white
feather
this
first
interview
between
europeans
and
aborigines
seemed
to
promise
amicable
and
lasting
intercourse
but
the
next
day
when
one
of
tasman
s
boats
was
looking
for
an
anchorage
nearer
to
the
land
seven
canoes

by
a
great
number
of

attacked

fiercely
the

capsized
and
filled
the
quartermaster

was
instantly
struck
with
a
spear
and
fell
into
the
sea
of
his
six
companions
four
were
killed
the
other
two
and
the
quartermaster
were
able
to
swim
to
the
ships
and
were
picked
up
and
recovered
after
this
sad
occurrence
tasman
set
sail
confining
his
revenge
to
giving
the
natives
a
few
which
probably
did
not
reach
them
he
left
this
bay
which
still
bears
the
name
of
massacre
bay
followed
the
western
coast
and
on
the
of
january
anchored
near
the
point
here
the
violence
of
the
surf
as
well
as
the
unfriendly
attitude
of
the
natives
prevented
his
obtaining
water
and
he
finally
quitted
these
shores
giving
them
the
name
or
the
land
of
the
states
in
honor
of
the
the
dutch
navigator
concluded
that
these
islands
were
adjacent
to
the
islands
of
the
same
name
on
the
east
of
terra
del
fuego
at
the
southern
point
of
the
american
continent
he
thought
he
had
found
the
great
southern
but
said
paganel
to
himself
what
a
seventeenth
century
sailor
might
call
a
continent
would
never
stand
for
one
with
a
nineteenth
century
man
no
such
mistake
can
be
supposed
no
there
is
something
here
that
baffles
chapter
iii
the
of
navigators
on
the
of
january
four
days
after
starting
the
macquarie
had
not
done
of
the
distance
between
australia
and
new
zealand
will
halley
took
very
little
heed
to
the
working
of
the
ship
he
let
things
take
their
chance
he
seldom
showed
himself
for
which
no
one
was
sorry
no
one
would
have
complained
if
he
had
passed
all
his
time
in
his
cabin
but
for
the
fact
that
the
brutal
captain
was
every
day
under
the
influence
of
gin
or
brandy
his
sailors
willingly
followed
his
example
and
no
ship
ever
sailed
more
entirely
depending
on
providence
than
the
macquarie
did
from
twofold
bay
this
unpardonable
carelessness
obliged
john
mangles
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
ever
open
mulrady
and
wilson
more
than
once
brought
round
the
helm
when
some
careless
steering
threatened
to
throw
the
ship
on
her
often
will
halley
would
interfere
and
abuse
the
two
sailors
with
a
volley
of
oaths
the
latter
in
their
impatience
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
bind
this
drunken
captain
and
lower
him
into
the
hold
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
but
john
mangles
succeeded
after
some
persuasion
in
calming
their
indignation
still
the
position
of
things
filled
him
with
anxiety
but
for
fear
of
alarming
glenarvan
he
spoke
only
to
paganel
or
the
major
mcnabbs
recommended
the
same
course
as
mulrady
and
wilson
if
you
think
it
would
be
for
the
general
good
john
said
mcnabbs
you
should
not
hesitate
to
take
the
command
of
the
vessel
when
we
get
to
auckland
the
drunken
imbecile
can
resume
his
command
and
then
he
is
at
liberty
to
wreck
himself
if
that
is
his
all
that
is
very
true
mcnabbs
and
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
i
will
do
it
as
long
as
we
are
on
open
sea
a
careful
lookout
is
enough
my
sailors
and
i
are
watching
on
the
poop
but
when
we
get
near
the
coast
i
confess
i
shall
be
uneasy
if
halley
does
not
come
to
his
could
not
you
direct
the
course
asked
paganel
that
would
be
difficult
replied
john
would
you
believe
it
that
there
is
not
a
chart
on
board
is
that
so
it
is
indeed
the
macquarie
only
does
a
coasting
trade
between
eden
and
auckland
and
halley
is
so
at
home
in
these
waters
that
he
takes
no
i
suppose
he
thinks
the
ship
knows
the
way
and
steers
ha
ha
laughed
john
mangles
i
do
not
believe
in
ships
that
steer
themselves
and
if
halley
is
drunk
when
we
get
among
soundings
he
will
get
us
all
into
let
us
hope
said
paganel
that
the
neighborhood
of
land
will
bring
him
to
his
well
then
said
mcnabbs
if
needs
were
you
could
not
sail
the
macquarie
into
auckland
without
a
chart
of
the
coast
certainly
not
the
coast
is
very
dangerous
it
is
a
series
of
shallow
fiords
as
irregular
and
capricious
as
the
fiords
of
norway
there
are
many
reefs
and
it
requires
great
experience
to
avoid
them
the
strongest
ship
would
be
lost
if
her
keel
struck
one
of
those
rocks
that
are
submerged
but
a
few
feet
below
the
in
that
case
those
on
board
would
have
to
take
refuge
on
the
if
there
was
a
terrible
extremity
said
paganel
for
they
are
not
hospitable
shores
and
the
dangers
of
the
land
are
not
less
appalling
than
the
dangers
of
the
you
refer
to
the
maories
monsieur
paganel
asked
john
mangles
yes
my
friend
they
have
a
bad
name
in
these
waters
it
is
not
a
matter
of
timid
or
brutish
australians
but
of
an
intelligent
and
sanguinary
race
cannibals
greedy
of
human
flesh
to
whom
we
should
look
in
vain
for
well
then
exclaimed
the
major
if
captain
grant
had
been
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
new
zealand
you
would
dissuade
us
from
looking
for
oh
you
might
search
on
the
coasts
replied
the
geographer
because
you
might
find
traces
of
the
britannia
but
not
in
the
interior
for
it
would
be
perfectly
useless
every
european
who
ventures
into
these
fatal
districts
falls
into
the
hands
of
the
maories
and
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
maories
is
a
lost
man
i
have
urged
my
friends
to
cross
the
pampas
to
toil
over
the
plains
of
australia
but
i
will
never
lure
them
into
the
mazes
of
the
new
zealand
forest
may
heaven
be
our
guide
and
keep
us
from
ever
being
thrown
within
the
power
of
those
fierce
natives
chapter
iv
the
wreck
of
the
macquarie
still
this
wearisome
voyage
dragged
on
on
the
of
february
six
days
from
starting
the
macquarie
had
not
yet
made
a
nearer
acquaintance
with
the
shores
of
auckland
the
wind
was
fair
nevertheless
and
blew
steadily
from
the
southwest
but
the
currents
were
against
the
ship
s
course
and
she
scarcely
made
any
way
the
heavy
lumpy
sea
strained
her
cordage
her
timbers
creaked
and
she
labored
painfully
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
her
standing
rigging
was
so
out
of
order
that
it
allowed
play
to
the
masts
which
were
violently
shaken
at
every
roll
of
the
sea
fortunately
will
halley
was
not
a
man
in
a
hurry
and
did
not
use
a
press
of
canvas
or
his
masts
would
inevitably
have
come
down
john
mangles
therefore
hoped
that
the
wretched
hull
would
reach
port
without
accident
but
it
grieved
him
that
his
companions
should
have
to
suffer
so
much
discomfort
from
the
defective
arrangements
of
the
brig
but
neither
lady
helena
nor
mary
grant
uttered
a
word
of
complaint
though
the
continuous
rain
obliged
them
to
stay
below
where
the
want
of
air
and
the
violence
of
the
motion
were
painfully
felt
they
often
braved
the
weather
and
went
on
the
poop
till
driven
down
again
by
the
force
of
a
sudden
squall
then
they
returned
to
the
narrow
space
fitter
for
stowing
cargo
than
accommodating
passengers
especially
ladies
their
friends
did
their
best
to
amuse
them
paganel
tried
to
beguile
the
time
with
his
stories
but
it
was
a
hopeless
case
their
minds
were
so
distracted
at
this
change
of
route
as
to
be
quite
unhinged
much
as
they
had
been
interested
in
his
dissertation
on
the
pampas
or
australia
his
lectures
on
new
zealand
fell
on
cold
and
indifferent
ears
besides
they
were
going
to
this
new
and
country
without
enthusiasm
without
conviction
not
even
of
their
own
free
will
but
solely
at
the
bidding
of
destiny
of
all
the
passengers
on
board
the
macquarie
the
most
to
be
pitied
was
lord
glenarvan
he
was
rarely
to
be
seen
below
he
could
not
stay
in
one
place
his
nervous
organization
highly
excited
could
not
submit
to
confinement
between
four
narrow
bulkheads
all
day
long
even
all
night
regardless
of
the
torrents
of
rain
and
the
dashing
waves
he
stayed
on
the
poop
sometimes
leaning
on
the
rail
sometimes
walking
to
and
fro
in
feverish
agitation
his
eyes
wandered
ceaselessly
over
the
blank
horizon
he
scanned
it
eagerly
during
every
short
interval
of
clear
weather
it
seemed
as
if
he
sought
to
question
the
voiceless
waters
he
longed
to
tear
away
the
veil
of
fog
and
vapor
that
obscured
his
view
he
could
not
be
resigned
and
his
features
expressed
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
he
was
a
man
of
energy
till
now
happy
and
powerful
and
deprived
in
a
moment
of
power
and
happiness
john
mangles
bore
him
company
and
endured
with
him
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
on
this
day
glenarvan
looked
more
anxiously
than
ever
at
each
point
where
a
break
in
the
mist
enabled
him
to
do
so
john
came
up
to
him
and
said
your
lordship
is
looking
out
for
land
glenarvan
shook
his
head
in
dissent
and
yet
said
the
young
captain
you
must
be
longing
to
quit
this
vessel
we
ought
to
have
seen
the
lights
of
auckland
hours
glenarvan
made
no
reply
he
still
looked
and
for
a
moment
his
glass
was
pointed
toward
the
horizon
to
windward
the
land
is
not
on
that
side
my
lord
said
john
mangles
look
more
to
why
john
replied
glenarvan
i
am
not
looking
for
the
what
then
my
lord
my
yacht
the
duncan
said
glenarvan
hotly
it
must
be
here
on
these
coasts
skimming
these
very
waves
playing
the
vile
part
of
a
pirate
it
is
here
john
i
am
certain
of
it
on
the
track
of
vessels
between
australia
and
new
zealand
and
i
have
a
presentiment
that
we
shall
fall
in
with
god
keep
us
from
such
a
meeting
why
john
your
lordship
forgets
our
position
what
could
we
do
in
this
ship
if
the
duncan
gave
chase
we
could
not
even
fly
fly
john
yes
my
lord
we
should
try
in
vain
we
should
be
taken
delivered
up
to
the
mercy
of
those
wretches
and
ben
joyce
has
shown
us
that
he
does
not
stop
at
a
crime
our
lives
would
be
worth
little
we
would
fight
to
the
death
of
course
but
after
that
think
of
lady
glenarvan
think
of
mary
grant
poor
girls
murmured
glenarvan
john
my
heart
is
broken
and
sometimes
despair
nearly
masters
me
i
feel
as
if
fresh
misfortunes
awaited
us
and
that
heaven
itself
is
against
us
it
terrifies
me
you
my
lord
not
for
myself
john
but
for
those
i
love
whom
you
love
keep
up
your
heart
my
lord
said
the
young
captain
we
must
not
look
out
for
troubles
the
macquarie
sails
badly
but
she
makes
some
way
nevertheless
will
halley
is
a
brute
but
i
am
keeping
my
eyes
open
and
if
the
coast
looks
dangerous
i
will
put
the
ship
s
head
to
sea
again
so
that
on
that
score
there
is
little
or
no
danger
but
as
to
getting
alongside
the
duncan
god
forbid
and
if
your
lordship
is
bent
on
looking
out
for
her
let
it
be
in
order
to
give
her
a
wide
john
mangles
was
right
an
encounter
with
the
duncan
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
macquarie
there
was
every
reason
to
fear
such
an
engagement
in
these
narrow
seas
in
which
pirates
could
ply
their
trade
without
risk
however
for
that
day
at
least
the
yacht
did
not
appear
and
the
sixth
night
from
their
departure
from
twofold
bay
came
without
the
fears
of
john
mangles
being
realized
but
that
night
was
to
be
a
night
of
terrors
darkness
came
on
almost
suddenly
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
sky
was
very
threatening
the
sailor
instinct
rose
above
the
stupefaction
of
the
drunkard
and
roused
will
halley
he
left
his
cabin
rubbed
his
eyes
and
shook
his
great
red
head
then
he
drew
a
great
deep
breath
of
air
as
other
people
swallow
a
draught
of
water
to
revive
themselves
he
examined
the
masts
the
wind
freshened
and
veering
a
point
more
to
the
westward
blew
right
for
the
new
zealand
coast
illustration
omitted
page
intentionally
blank
will
halley
with
many
an
oath
called
his
men
tightened
his
topmast
cordage
and
made
all
snug
for
the
night
john
mangles
approved
in
silence
he
had
ceased
to
hold
any
conversation
with
the
coarse
seaman
but
neither
glenarvan
nor
he
left
the
poop
two
hours
after
a
stiff
breeze
came
on
will
halley
took
in
the
lower
reef
of
his
topsails
the
maneuver
would
have
been
a
difficult
job
for
five
men
if
the
macquarie
had
not
carried
a
double
yard
on
the
american
plan
in
fact
they
had
only
to
lower
the
upper
yard
to
bring
the
sail
to
its
smallest
size
two
hours
passed
the
sea
was
rising
the
macquarie
was
struck
so
violently
that
it
seemed
as
if
her
keel
had
touched
the
rocks
there
was
no
real
danger
but
the
heavy
vessel
did
not
rise
easily
to
the
waves
by
and
by
the
returning
waves
would
break
over
the
deck
in
great
masses
the
boat
was
washed
out
of
the
davits
by
the
force
of
the
water
john
mangles
never
released
his
watch
any
other
ship
would
have
made
no
account
of
a
sea
like
this
but
with
this
heavy
craft
there
was
a
danger
of
sinking
by
the
bow
for
the
deck
was
filled
at
every
lurch
and
the
sheet
of
water
not
being
able
to
escape
quickly
by
the
scuppers
might
submerge
the
ship
it
would
have
been
the
wisest
plan
to
prepare
for
emergency
by
knocking
out
the
bulwarks
with
an
ax
to
facilitate
their
escape
but
halley
refused
to
take
this
precaution
but
a
greater
danger
was
at
hand
and
one
that
it
was
too
late
to
prevent
about
eleven
john
mangles
and
wilson
who
stayed
on
deck
throughout
the
gale
were
suddenly
struck
by
an
unusual
noise
their
nautical
instincts
awoke
john
seized
the
sailor
s
hand
the
reef
said
he
yes
said
wilson
the
waves
breaking
on
the
not
more
than
two
cables
length
off
at
farthest
the
land
is
there
john
leaned
over
the
side
gazed
into
the
dark
water
and
called
out
wilson
the
lead
the
master
posted
forward
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
his
position
wilson
seized
the
sprang
to
the
and
threw
the
lead
the
rope
ran
out
between
his
fingers
at
the
third
knot
the
lead
stopped
three
fathoms
cried
wilson
captain
said
john
running
to
will
halley
we
are
on
the
whether
or
not
he
saw
halley
shrug
his
shoulders
is
of
very
little
importance
but
he
hurried
to
the
helm
put
it
hard
down
while
wilson
leaving
the
line
hauled
at
the
brace
to
bring
the
ship
to
the
wind
the
man
who
was
steering
received
a
smart
blow
and
could
not
comprehend
the
sudden
attack
let
her
go
let
her
go
said
the
young
captain
working
her
to
get
away
from
the
reefs
for
half
a
minute
the
starboard
side
of
the
vessel
was
turned
toward
them
and
in
spite
of
the
darkness
john
could
discern
a
line
of
foam
which
moaned
and
gleamed
four
fathoms
away
at
this
moment
will
halley
comprehending
the
danger
lost
his
head
his
sailors
hardly
sobered
could
not
understand
his
orders
his
incoherent
words
his
contradictory
orders
showed
that
this
stupid
sot
had
quite
lost
his
he
was
taken
by
surprise
at
the
proximity
of
the
land
which
was
eight
miles
off
when
he
thought
it
was
thirty
or
forty
miles
off
the
currents
had
thrown
him
out
of
his
habitual
track
and
this
miserable
slave
of
routine
was
left
quite
helpless
still
the
prompt
maneuver
of
john
mangles
succeeded
in
keeping
the
macquarie
off
the
breakers
but
john
did
not
know
the
position
for
anything
he
could
tell
he
was
girdled
in
by
reefs
the
wind
blew
them
strongly
toward
the
east
and
at
every
lurch
they
might
strike
in
fact
the
sound
of
the
reef
soon
redoubled
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
bow
they
must
luff
again
john
put
the
helm
down
again
and
brought
her
up
the
breakers
increased
under
the
bow
of
the
vessel
and
it
was
necessary
to
put
her
about
to
regain
the
open
sea
whether
she
would
be
able
to
go
about
under
shortened
sail
and
badly
trimmed
as
she
was
remained
to
be
seen
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
helm
hard
down
cried
mangles
to
wilson
the
macquarie
began
to
near
the
new
line
of
reefs
in
another
moment
the
waves
were
seen
dashing
on
submerged
rocks
it
was
a
moment
of
inexpressible
anxiety
the
spray
was
luminous
just
as
if
lit
up
by
sudden
phosphorescence
the
roaring
of
the
sea
was
like
the
voice
of
those
ancient
tritons
whom
poetic
mythology
endowed
with
life
wilson
and
mulrady
hung
to
the
wheel
with
all
their
weight
some
cordage
gave
way
which
endangered
the
foremast
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
she
would
go
about
without
further
damage
suddenly
the
wind
fell
and
the
vessel
fell
back
and
turning
her
became
hopeless
a
high
wave
caught
her
below
carried
her
up
on
the
reefs
where
she
struck
with
great
violence
the
foremast
came
down
with
all
the
the
brig
rose
twice
and
then
lay
motionless
heeled
over
on
her
port
side
at
an
angle
of
degrees
the
glass
of
the
skylight
had
been
smashed
to
powder
the
passengers
rushed
out
but
the
waves
were
sweeping
the
deck
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
they
dared
not
stay
there
john
mangles
knowing
the
ship
to
be
safely
lodged
in
the
sand
begged
them
to
return
to
their
own
quarters
tell
me
the
truth
john
said
glenarvan
calmly
the
truth
my
lord
is
that
we
are
at
a
standstill
whether
the
sea
will
devour
us
is
another
question
but
we
have
time
to
it
is
midnight
yes
my
lord
and
we
must
wait
for
the
can
we
not
lower
the
boat
in
such
a
sea
and
in
the
dark
it
is
impossible
and
besides
where
could
we
land
well
then
john
let
us
wait
for
the
will
halley
however
ran
up
and
down
the
deck
like
a
maniac
his
crew
had
recovered
their
senses
and
now
broached
a
cask
of
brandy
and
began
to
drink
john
foresaw
that
if
they
became
drunk
terrible
scenes
would
ensue
the
captain
could
not
be
relied
on
to
restrain
them
the
wretched
man
tore
his
hair
and
wrung
his
hands
his
whole
thought
was
his
uninsured
cargo
i
am
ruined
i
am
lost
he
would
cry
as
he
ran
from
side
to
side
john
mangles
did
not
waste
time
on
him
he
armed
his
two
companions
and
they
all
held
themselves
in
readiness
to
resist
the
sailors
who
were
filling
themselves
with
brandy
seasoned
with
fearful
blasphemies
the
first
of
these
wretches
that
comes
near
the
ladies
i
will
shoot
like
a
dog
said
the
major
quietly
the
sailors
doubtless
saw
that
the
passengers
were
determined
to
hold
their
own
for
after
some
attempts
at
pillage
they
disappeared
to
their
own
quarters
john
mangles
thought
no
more
of
these
drunken
rascals
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
dawn
the
ship
was
now
quite
motionless
the
sea
became
gradually
calmer
the
wind
fell
the
hull
would
be
safe
for
some
hours
yet
at
daybreak
john
examined
the
the
yawl
which
was
now
their
only
boat
would
carry
the
crew
and
the
passengers
it
would
have
to
make
three
trips
at
least
as
it
could
only
hold
four
as
he
was
leaning
on
the
skylight
thinking
over
the
situation
of
affairs
john
mangles
could
hear
the
roaring
of
the
surf
he
tried
to
pierce
the
darkness
he
wondered
how
far
it
was
to
the
land
they
longed
for
no
less
than
dreaded
a
reef
sometimes
extends
for
miles
along
the
coast
could
their
fragile
boat
hold
out
on
a
long
trip
while
john
was
thus
ruminating
and
longing
for
a
little
light
from
the
murky
sky
the
ladies
relying
on
him
slept
in
their
little
berths
the
stationary
attitude
of
the
brig
insured
them
some
hours
of
repose
glenarvan
john
and
their
companions
no
longer
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
the
crew
who
were
now
wrapped
in
a
drunken
sleep
also
refreshed
themselves
by
a
short
nap
and
a
profound
silence
reigned
on
board
the
ship
herself
slumbering
peacefully
on
her
bed
of
sand
toward
four
o
clock
the
first
peep
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
east
the
clouds
were
dimly
defined
by
the
pale
light
of
the
dawn
john
returned
to
the
deck
the
horizon
was
veiled
with
a
curtain
of
fog
some
faint
outlines
were
shadowed
in
the
mist
but
at
a
considerable
height
a
slight
swell
still
agitated
the
sea
but
the
more
distant
waves
were
undistinguishable
in
a
motionless
bank
of
clouds
john
waited
the
light
gradually
increased
and
the
horizon
acquired
a
rosy
hue
the
curtain
slowly
rose
over
the
vast
watery
stage
black
reefs
rose
out
of
the
waters
then
a
line
became
defined
on
the
belt
of
foam
and
there
gleamed
a
luminous
point
behind
a
low
hill
which
concealed
the
scarcely
risen
sun
there
was
the
land
less
than
nine
miles
off
land
ho
cried
john
mangles
his
companions
aroused
by
his
voice
rushed
to
the
poop
and
gazed
in
silence
at
the
coast
whose
outline
lay
on
the
horizon
whether
they
were
received
as
friends
or
enemies
that
coast
must
be
their
refuge
where
is
halley
asked
glenarvan
i
do
not
know
my
lord
replied
john
mangles
where
are
the
sailors
invisible
like
probably
dead
drunk
like
himself
added
mcnabbs
let
them
be
called
said
glenarvan
we
can
not
leave
them
on
the
mulrady
and
wilson
went
down
to
the
forecastle
and
two
minutes
after
they
returned
the
place
was
empty
they
then
searched
between
decks
and
then
the
hold
but
found
no
trace
of
will
halley
nor
his
sailors
what
no
one
exclaimed
glenarvan
could
they
have
fallen
into
the
sea
asked
paganel
everything
is
possible
replied
john
mangles
who
was
getting
uneasy
then
turning
toward
the
stern
to
the
boat
said
he
wilson
and
mulrady
followed
to
launch
the
yawl
the
yawl
was
gone
chapter
v
cannibals
will
halley
and
his
crew
taking
advantage
of
the
darkness
of
night
and
the
sleep
of
the
passengers
had
fled
with
the
only
boat
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
captain
whose
duty
would
have
kept
him
on
board
to
the
last
had
been
the
first
to
quit
the
ship
the
cowards
are
off
said
john
mangles
well
my
lord
so
much
the
better
they
have
spared
us
some
trying
no
doubt
said
glenarvan
besides
we
have
a
captain
of
our
own
and
courageous
if
unskillful
sailors
your
companions
john
say
the
word
and
we
are
ready
to
the
major
paganel
robert
wilson
mulrady
olbinett
himself
applauded
glenarvan
s
speech
and
ranged
themselves
on
the
deck
ready
to
execute
their
captain
s
orders
what
is
to
be
done
asked
glenarvan
it
was
evident
that
raising
the
macquarie
was
out
of
the
question
and
no
less
evident
that
she
must
be
abandoned
waiting
on
board
for
succor
that
might
never
come
would
have
been
imprudence
and
folly
before
the
arrival
of
a
chance
vessel
on
the
scene
the
macquarie
would
have
broken
up
the
next
storm
or
even
a
high
tide
raised
by
the
winds
from
seaward
would
roll
it
on
the
sands
break
it
up
into
splinters
and
scatter
them
on
the
shore
john
was
anxious
to
reach
the
land
before
this
inevitable
consummation
he
proposed
to
construct
a
raft
strong
enough
to
carry
the
passengers
and
a
sufficient
quantity
of
provisions
to
the
coast
of
new
zealand
there
was
no
time
for
discussion
the
work
was
to
be
set
about
at
once
and
they
had
made
considerable
progress
when
night
came
and
interrupted
them
toward
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
after
supper
while
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
slept
in
their
berths
paganel
and
his
friends
conversed
on
serious
matters
as
they
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
robert
had
chosen
to
stay
with
them
the
brave
boy
listened
with
all
his
ears
ready
to
be
of
use
and
willing
to
enlist
in
any
perilous
adventure
paganel
asked
john
mangles
whether
the
raft
could
not
follow
the
coast
as
far
as
auckland
instead
of
landing
its
freight
on
the
coast
john
replied
that
the
voyage
was
impossible
with
such
an
unmanageable
craft
and
what
we
can
not
do
on
a
raft
could
have
been
done
in
the
ship
s
boat
yes
if
necessary
answered
john
but
we
should
have
had
to
sail
by
day
and
anchor
at
then
those
wretches
who
abandoned
us
oh
as
for
them
said
john
they
were
drunk
and
in
the
darkness
i
have
no
doubt
they
paid
for
their
cowardice
with
their
so
much
the
worse
for
them
and
for
us
replied
paganel
for
the
boat
would
have
been
very
useful
to
what
would
you
have
paganel
the
raft
will
bring
us
to
the
shore
said
glenarvan
the
very
thing
i
would
fain
avoid
exclaimed
the
geographer
what
do
you
think
another
twenty
miles
after
crossing
the
pampas
and
australia
can
have
any
terrors
for
us
hardened
as
we
are
to
fatigue
my
friend
replied
paganel
i
do
not
call
in
question
our
courage
nor
the
bravery
of
our
friends
twenty
miles
would
be
nothing
in
any
other
country
than
new
zealand
you
can
not
suspect
me
of
i
was
the
first
to
persuade
you
to
cross
america
and
australia
but
here
the
case
is
different
i
repeat
anything
is
better
than
to
venture
into
this
treacherous
anything
is
better
in
my
judgment
said
john
mangles
than
braving
certain
destruction
on
a
stranded
what
is
there
so
formidable
in
new
zealand
asked
glenarvan
the
savages
said
paganel
the
savages
repeated
glenarvan
can
we
not
avoid
them
by
keeping
to
the
shore
but
in
any
case
what
have
we
to
fear
surely
two
resolute
and
europeans
need
not
give
a
thought
to
an
attack
by
a
handful
of
miserable
paganel
shook
his
head
in
this
case
there
are
no
miserable
beings
to
contend
with
the
new
zealanders
are
a
powerful
race
who
are
rebelling
against
english
rule
who
fight
the
invaders
and
often
beat
them
and
who
always
eat
them
cannibals
exclaimed
robert
cannibals
then
they
heard
him
whisper
my
sister
lady
don
t
frighten
yourself
my
boy
said
glenarvan
our
friend
paganel
far
from
it
rejoined
paganel
robert
has
shown
himself
a
man
and
i
treat
him
as
such
in
not
concealing
the
truth
from
paganel
was
right
cannibalism
has
become
a
fixed
fact
in
new
zealand
as
it
is
in
the
fijis
and
in
torres
strait
superstition
is
no
doubt
partly
to
blame
but
cannibalism
is
certainly
owing
to
the
fact
that
there
are
moments
when
game
is
scarce
and
hunger
great
the
savages
began
by
eating
human
flesh
to
appease
the
demands
of
an
appetite
rarely
satiated
subsequently
the
priests
regulated
and
satisfied
the
monstrous
custom
what
was
a
meal
was
raised
to
the
dignity
of
a
ceremony
that
is
all
besides
in
the
eyes
of
the
maories
nothing
is
more
natural
than
to
eat
one
another
the
missionaries
often
questioned
them
about
cannibalism
they
asked
them
why
they
devoured
their
brothers
to
which
the
chiefs
made
answer
that
fish
eat
fish
dogs
eat
men
men
eat
dogs
and
dogs
eat
one
another
even
the
maori
mythology
has
a
legend
of
a
god
who
ate
another
god
and
with
such
a
precedent
who
could
resist
eating
his
neighbor
another
strange
notion
is
that
in
eating
a
dead
enemy
they
consume
his
spiritual
being
and
so
inherit
his
soul
his
strength
and
his
bravery
which
they
hold
are
specially
lodged
in
the
brain
this
accounts
for
the
fact
that
the
brain
figures
in
their
feasts
as
the
choicest
delicacy
and
is
offered
to
the
most
honored
guest
but
while
he
acknowledged
all
this
paganel
maintained
not
without
a
show
of
reason
that
sensuality
and
especially
hunger
was
the
first
cause
of
cannibalism
among
the
new
zealanders
and
not
only
among
the
polynesian
races
but
also
among
the
savages
of
europe
for
said
he
cannibalism
was
long
prevalent
among
the
ancestors
of
the
most
civilized
people
and
especially
if
the
major
will
not
think
me
personal
among
the
really
said
mcnabbs
yes
major
replied
paganel
if
you
read
certain
passages
of
saint
jerome
on
the
atticoli
of
scotland
you
will
see
what
he
thought
of
your
forefathers
and
without
going
so
far
back
as
historic
times
under
the
reign
of
elizabeth
when
shakespeare
was
dreaming
out
his
a
scotch
bandit
sawney
bean
was
executed
for
the
crime
of
cannibalism
was
it
religion
that
prompted
him
to
cannibalism
no
it
was
hunger
said
john
mangles
hunger
repeated
paganel
but
above
all
the
necessity
of
the
carnivorous
appetite
of
replacing
the
bodily
waste
by
the
azote
contained
in
animal
tissues
the
lungs
are
satisfied
with
a
provision
of
vegetable
and
farinaceous
food
but
to
be
strong
and
active
the
body
must
be
supplied
with
those
plastic
elements
that
renew
the
muscles
until
the
maories
become
members
of
the
vegetarian
association
they
will
eat
meat
and
human
flesh
as
why
not
animal
flesh
asked
glenarvan
because
they
have
no
animals
replied
paganel
and
that
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
not
to
extenuate
but
to
explain
their
cannibal
habits
quadrupeds
and
even
birds
are
rare
on
these
inhospitable
shores
so
that
the
maories
have
always
eaten
human
flesh
there
are
even
seasons
as
there
are
in
civilized
countries
hunting
seasons
then
begin
the
great
wars
and
whole
tribes
are
served
up
on
the
tables
of
the
well
then
said
glenarvan
according
to
your
mode
of
reasoning
paganel
cannibalism
will
not
cease
in
new
zealand
until
her
pastures
teem
with
sheep
and
evidently
my
dear
lord
and
even
then
it
will
take
years
to
wean
them
from
maori
flesh
which
they
prefer
to
all
others
for
the
children
will
still
have
a
relish
for
what
their
fathers
so
highly
appreciated
according
to
them
it
tastes
like
pork
with
even
more
flavor
as
to
white
men
s
flesh
they
do
not
like
it
so
well
because
the
whites
eat
salt
with
their
food
which
gives
a
peculiar
flavor
not
to
the
taste
of
they
are
dainty
said
the
major
but
black
or
white
do
they
eat
it
raw
or
cook
it
why
what
is
that
to
you
mcnabbs
cried
robert
what
is
that
to
me
exclaimed
the
major
earnestly
if
i
am
to
make
a
meal
for
a
cannibal
i
should
prefer
being
why
because
then
i
should
be
sure
of
not
being
eaten
alive
very
good
major
said
paganel
but
suppose
they
cooked
you
alive
the
fact
is
answered
the
major
i
would
not
give
for
the
choice
well
mcnabbs
if
it
will
comfort
you
you
may
as
well
be
told
the
new
zealanders
do
not
eat
flesh
without
cooking
or
smoking
it
they
are
very
clever
and
experienced
in
cookery
for
my
part
i
very
much
dislike
the
idea
of
being
eaten
the
idea
of
ending
one
s
life
in
the
maw
of
a
savage
bah
the
conclusion
of
all
said
john
mangles
is
that
we
must
not
fall
into
their
hands
let
us
hope
that
one
day
christianity
will
abolish
all
these
monstrous
yes
we
must
hope
so
replied
paganel
but
believe
me
a
savage
who
has
tasted
human
flesh
is
not
easily
persuaded
to
forego
it
i
will
relate
two
facts
which
prove
by
all
means
let
us
have
the
facts
paganel
said
glenarvan
the
first
is
narrated
in
the
chronicles
of
the
jesuit
society
in
brazil
a
portuguese
missionary
was
one
day
visiting
an
old
brazilian
woman
who
was
very
she
had
only
a
few
days
to
live
the
jesuit
inculcated
the
truths
of
religion
which
the
dying
woman
accepted
without
objection
then
having
attended
to
her
spiritual
wants
he
bethought
himself
of
her
bodily
needs
and
offered
her
some
european
delicacies
alas
said
she
my
digestion
is
too
weak
to
bear
any
kind
of
food
there
is
only
one
thing
i
could
fancy
and
nobody
here
could
get
it
for
what
is
it
asked
the
jesuit
ah
my
son
said
she
it
is
the
hand
of
a
little
boy
i
feel
as
if
i
should
enjoy
munching
the
little
bones
horrid
but
i
wonder
is
it
so
very
nice
said
robert
my
second
tale
will
answer
you
my
boy
said
paganel
one
day
a
missionary
was
reproving
a
cannibal
for
the
horrible
custom
so
abhorrent
to
god
s
laws
of
eating
human
flesh
and
beside
said
he
it
must
be
so
nasty
oh
father
said
the
savage
looking
greedily
at
the
missionary
say
that
god
forbids
it
that
is
a
reason
for
what
you
tell
us
but
don
t
say
it
is
nasty
if
you
had
only
tasted
it
chapter
vi
a
dreaded
country
paganel
s
facts
were
indisputable
the
cruelty
of
the
new
zealanders
was
beyond
a
doubt
therefore
it
was
dangerous
to
land
but
had
the
danger
been
a
hundredfold
greater
it
had
to
be
faced
john
mangles
felt
the
necessity
of
leaving
without
delay
a
vessel
doomed
to
certain
and
speedy
destruction
there
were
two
dangers
one
certain
and
the
other
probable
but
no
one
could
hesitate
between
them
as
to
their
chance
of
being
picked
up
by
a
passing
vessel
they
could
not
reasonably
hope
for
it
the
macquarie
was
not
in
the
track
of
ships
bound
to
new
zealand
they
keep
further
north
for
auckland
further
south
for
new
plymouth
and
the
ship
had
struck
just
between
these
two
points
on
the
desert
region
of
the
shores
of
a
dangerous
difficult
coast
and
infested
by
desperate
characters
when
shall
we
get
away
asked
glenarvan
morning
at
ten
o
clock
replied
john
mangles
the
tide
will
then
turn
and
carry
us
to
next
day
february
at
eight
o
clock
the
raft
was
finished
john
had
given
all
his
attention
to
the
building
of
this
structure
the
foreyard
which
did
very
well
for
mooring
the
anchors
was
quite
inadequate
to
the
transport
of
passengers
and
provisions
what
was
needed
was
a
strong
manageable
raft
that
would
resist
the
force
of
the
waves
during
a
passage
of
nine
miles
nothing
but
the
masts
could
supply
suitable
materials
wilson
and
mulrady
set
to
work
the
rigging
was
cut
clear
and
the
mainmast
chopped
away
at
the
base
fell
over
the
starboard
rail
which
crashed
under
its
weight
the
macquarie
was
thus
razed
like
a
pontoon
when
the
lower
mast
the
topmasts
and
the
royals
were
sawn
and
split
the
principal
pieces
of
the
raft
were
ready
they
were
then
joined
to
the
fragments
of
the
foremast
and
the
whole
was
fastened
securely
together
john
took
the
precaution
to
place
in
the
interstices
half
a
dozen
empty
barrels
which
would
raise
the
structure
above
the
level
of
the
water
on
this
strong
foundation
wilson
laid
a
kind
of
floor
in
open
work
made
of
the
gratings
off
the
hatches
the
spray
could
then
dash
on
the
raft
without
staying
there
and
the
passengers
would
be
kept
dry
in
addition
to
this
the
firmly
lashed
together
formed
a
kind
of
circular
barrier
which
protected
the
deck
from
the
waves
that
morning
john
seeing
that
the
wind
was
in
their
favor
rigged
up
the
in
the
middle
of
the
raft
as
a
mast
it
was
stayed
with
shrouds
and
carried
a
makeshift
sail
a
large
oar
was
fixed
behind
to
act
as
a
rudder
in
case
the
wind
was
sufficient
to
require
it
the
greatest
pains
had
been
expended
on
strengthening
the
raft
to
resist
the
force
of
the
waves
but
the
question
remained
whether
in
the
event
of
a
change
of
wind
they
could
steer
or
indeed
whether
they
could
hope
ever
to
reach
the
land
at
nine
o
clock
they
began
to
load
first
came
the
provisions
in
quantity
sufficient
to
last
till
they
should
reach
auckland
for
they
could
not
count
on
the
productions
of
this
barren
region
olbinett
s
stores
furnished
some
preserved
meat
which
remained
of
the
purchase
made
for
their
voyage
in
the
macquarie
this
was
but
a
scanty
resource
they
had
to
fall
back
on
the
coarse
viands
of
the
ship
sea
biscuits
of
inferior
quality
and
two
casks
of
salt
fish
the
steward
was
quite
crestfallen
these
provisions
were
put
in
hermetically
sealed
cases
staunch
and
safe
from
sea
water
and
then
lowered
on
to
the
raft
and
strongly
lashed
to
the
foot
of
the
mast
the
arms
and
ammunition
were
piled
in
a
dry
corner
fortunately
the
travelers
were
well
armed
with
carbines
and
revolvers
a
holding
anchor
was
also
put
on
board
in
case
john
should
be
unable
to
make
the
land
in
one
tide
and
would
have
to
seek
moorings
at
ten
o
clock
the
tide
turned
the
breeze
blew
gently
from
the
northwest
and
a
slight
swell
rocked
the
frail
craft
are
we
ready
asked
john
all
ready
captain
answered
wilson
all
aboard
cried
john
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
descended
by
a
rope
ladder
and
took
their
station
at
the
foot
of
the
mast
on
the
cases
of
provisions
their
companions
near
them
wilson
took
the
helm
john
stood
by
the
tackle
and
mulrady
cut
the
line
which
held
the
raft
to
the
ship
s
side
the
sail
was
spread
and
the
frail
structure
commenced
its
progress
toward
the
land
aided
by
wind
and
tide
the
coast
was
about
nine
miles
off
a
distance
that
a
boat
with
good
oars
would
have
accomplished
in
three
hours
but
with
a
raft
allowance
must
be
made
if
the
wind
held
they
might
reach
the
land
in
one
tide
but
if
the
breeze
died
away
the
ebb
would
carry
them
away
from
the
shore
and
they
would
be
compelled
to
anchor
and
wait
for
the
next
tide
a
serious
consideration
and
one
that
filled
john
mangles
with
anxiety
still
he
hoped
to
succeed
the
wind
freshened
the
tide
had
turned
at
ten
o
clock
and
by
three
they
must
either
make
the
land
or
anchor
to
save
themselves
from
being
carried
out
to
sea
they
made
a
good
start
little
by
little
the
black
line
of
the
reefs
and
the
yellow
banks
of
sand
disappeared
under
the
swelling
tide
extreme
watchfulness
and
perfect
skill
were
necessary
to
avoid
these
submerged
rocks
and
steer
a
bark
that
did
not
readily
answer
to
the
helm
and
that
constantly
broke
off
at
noon
they
were
still
five
miles
from
shore
a
tolerably
clear
sky
allowed
them
to
make
out
the
principal
features
of
the
land
in
the
northeast
rose
a
mountain
about
feet
high
whose
sharply
defined
outline
was
exactly
like
the
grinning
face
of
a
monkey
turned
toward
the
sky
it
was
pirongia
which
the
map
gave
as
exactly
on
the
parallel
at
twelve
paganel
remarked
that
all
the
rocks
had
disappeared
under
the
rising
tide
all
but
one
answered
lady
helena
which
madam
asked
paganel
there
replied
she
pointing
to
a
black
speck
a
mile
off
yes
indeed
said
paganel
let
us
try
to
ascertain
its
position
so
as
not
to
get
too
near
it
for
the
sea
will
soon
conceal
it
is
exactly
in
a
line
with
the
northern
slope
of
the
mountain
said
john
mangles
wilson
mind
you
give
it
a
wide
yes
captain
answered
the
sailor
throwing
his
whole
weight
on
the
great
oar
that
steered
the
raft
in
half
an
hour
they
had
made
half
a
mile
but
strange
to
say
the
black
point
still
rose
above
the
waves
john
looked
attentively
and
in
order
to
make
it
out
borrowed
paganel
s
telescope
that
is
no
reef
said
he
after
a
moment
it
is
something
floating
which
rises
and
falls
with
the
is
it
part
of
the
mast
of
the
macquarie
asked
lady
helena
no
said
glenarvan
none
of
her
timbers
could
have
come
so
stay
said
john
mangles
i
know
it
it
is
the
the
ship
s
boat
exclaimed
glenarvan
yes
my
lord
the
ship
s
boat
keel
the
unfortunate
creatures
cried
lady
helena
they
have
perished
yes
madam
replied
john
mangles
they
must
have
perished
for
in
the
midst
of
these
breakers
in
a
heavy
swell
on
that
pitchy
night
they
ran
to
certain
for
a
few
minutes
the
passengers
were
silent
they
gazed
at
the
frail
craft
as
they
drew
near
it
it
must
evidently
have
capsized
about
four
miles
from
the
shore
and
not
one
of
the
crew
could
have
escaped
but
this
boat
may
be
of
use
to
us
said
glenarvan
that
is
true
answered
john
mangles
keep
her
up
the
direction
was
slightly
changed
but
the
breeze
fell
gradually
and
it
was
two
hours
before
they
reached
the
boat
mulrady
stationed
forward
fended
off
the
blow
and
the
yawl
was
drawn
alongside
empty
asked
john
mangles
yes
captain
answered
the
sailor
the
boat
is
empty
and
all
its
seams
are
open
it
is
of
no
use
to
no
use
at
all
said
mcnabbs
none
at
all
said
john
mangles
it
is
good
for
nothing
but
to
i
regret
it
said
paganel
for
the
yawl
might
have
taken
us
to
we
must
bear
our
fate
monsieur
paganel
replied
john
mangles
but
for
my
part
in
such
a
stormy
sea
i
prefer
our
raft
to
that
crazy
boat
a
very
slight
shock
would
be
enough
to
break
her
up
therefore
my
lord
we
have
nothing
to
detain
us
as
you
think
best
on
then
wilson
said
john
and
bear
straight
for
the
there
was
still
an
hour
before
the
turn
of
the
tide
in
that
time
they
might
make
two
miles
but
the
wind
soon
fell
almost
entirely
and
the
raft
became
nearly
motionless
and
soon
began
to
drift
to
seaward
under
the
influence
of
the
john
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
let
go
the
anchor
said
he
mulrady
who
stood
to
execute
this
order
let
go
the
anchor
in
five
fathoms
water
the
raft
backed
about
two
fathoms
on
the
line
which
was
then
at
full
stretch
the
sail
was
taken
in
and
everything
made
snug
for
a
tedious
period
of
inaction
the
returning
tide
would
not
occur
till
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
as
john
mangles
did
not
care
to
go
on
in
the
dark
the
anchorage
was
for
the
night
or
at
least
till
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
land
being
in
sight
at
a
distance
of
less
than
three
miles
a
considerable
swell
raised
the
waves
and
seemed
to
set
in
continuously
toward
the
coast
and
perceiving
this
glenarvan
asked
john
why
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
this
swell
to
get
nearer
to
the
land
your
lordship
is
deceived
by
an
optical
illusion
said
the
young
captain
although
the
swell
seems
to
carry
the
waves
landward
it
does
not
really
move
at
all
it
is
mere
undulating
molecular
motion
nothing
more
throw
a
piece
of
wood
overboard
and
you
will
see
that
it
will
remain
quite
stationary
except
as
the
tide
affects
it
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
and
dinner
said
the
major
olbinett
unpacked
some
dried
meat
and
a
dozen
biscuits
the
steward
blushed
as
he
proffered
the
meager
bill
of
fare
but
it
was
received
with
a
good
grace
even
by
the
ladies
who
however
had
not
much
appetite
owing
to
the
violent
motion
this
motion
produced
by
the
jerking
of
the
raft
on
the
cable
while
she
lay
head
on
to
the
sea
was
very
severe
and
fatiguing
the
blows
of
the
short
tumbling
seas
were
as
severe
as
if
she
had
been
striking
on
a
submerged
rock
sometimes
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
she
was
not
aground
the
cable
strained
violently
and
every
half
hour
john
had
to
take
in
a
fathom
to
ease
it
without
this
precaution
it
would
certainly
have
given
way
and
the
raft
must
have
drifted
to
destruction
john
s
anxiety
may
easily
be
understood
his
cable
might
break
or
his
anchor
lose
its
hold
and
in
either
case
the
danger
was
imminent
night
drew
on
the
sun
s
disc
enlarged
by
refraction
was
dipping
below
the
horizon
the
distant
waves
glittered
in
the
west
and
sparkled
like
sheets
of
liquid
silver
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
that
direction
but
sky
and
water
except
one
object
the
hull
of
the
macquarie
motionless
on
her
rocky
bed
the
short
twilight
postponed
the
darkness
only
by
a
few
minutes
and
soon
the
coast
outline
which
bounded
the
view
on
the
east
and
north
was
lost
in
darkness
the
shipwrecked
party
were
in
an
agonizing
situation
on
their
narrow
raft
and
overtaken
by
the
shades
of
night
some
of
the
party
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
a
prey
to
evil
dreams
others
could
not
close
an
eye
when
the
day
dawned
the
whole
party
were
worn
out
with
fatigue
with
the
rising
tide
the
wind
blew
again
toward
the
land
it
was
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
john
arranged
everything
for
resuming
their
voyage
and
then
he
ordered
the
anchor
to
be
weighed
but
the
anchor
flukes
had
been
so
imbedded
in
the
sand
by
the
repeated
jerks
of
the
cable
that
without
a
windlass
it
was
impossible
to
detach
it
even
with
the
tackle
which
wilson
had
improvised
half
an
hour
was
lost
in
vain
efforts
john
impatient
of
delay
cut
the
rope
thus
sacrificing
his
anchor
and
also
the
possibility
of
anchoring
again
if
this
tide
failed
to
carry
them
to
land
but
he
decided
that
further
delay
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
an
committed
the
raft
to
the
mercy
of
the
wind
assisted
by
a
current
of
two
knots
an
hour
the
sail
was
spread
they
drifted
slowly
toward
the
land
which
rose
in
gray
hazy
masses
on
a
background
of
sky
illumined
by
the
rising
sun
the
reef
was
dexterously
avoided
and
doubled
but
with
the
fitful
breeze
the
raft
could
not
get
near
the
shore
what
toil
and
pain
to
reach
a
coast
so
full
of
danger
when
attained
at
nine
o
clock
the
land
was
less
than
a
mile
off
it
was
a
shore
fringed
with
breakers
a
practicable
had
to
be
discovered
gradually
the
breeze
grew
fainter
and
then
ceased
entirely
the
sail
flapped
idly
against
the
mast
and
john
had
it
furled
the
tide
alone
carried
the
raft
to
the
shore
but
steering
had
become
impossible
and
its
passage
was
impeded
by
immense
bands
of
fucus
at
ten
o
clock
john
found
himself
almost
at
a
not
three
cables
lengths
from
the
shore
having
lost
their
anchor
they
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
john
clenched
his
hands
he
was
racked
with
anxiety
and
cast
frenzied
glances
toward
this
inaccessible
shore
in
the
midst
of
his
perplexities
a
shock
was
felt
the
raft
stood
still
it
had
landed
on
a
fathoms
from
the
coast
glenarvan
robert
wilson
and
mulrady
jumped
into
the
water
the
raft
was
firmly
moored
to
the
nearest
rocks
the
ladies
were
carried
to
land
without
wetting
a
fold
of
their
dresses
and
soon
the
whole
party
with
their
arms
and
provisions
were
finally
landed
on
these
much
dreaded
new
zealand
shores
chapter
vii
the
maori
war
glenarvan
would
have
liked
to
start
without
an
hour
s
delay
and
follow
the
coast
to
auckland
but
since
the
morning
heavy
clouds
had
been
gathering
and
toward
eleven
o
clock
after
the
landing
was
effected
the
vapors
condensed
into
violent
rain
so
that
instead
of
starting
they
had
to
look
for
shelter
wilson
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
what
just
suited
their
wants
a
grotto
hollowed
out
by
the
sea
in
the
basaltic
rocks
here
the
travelers
took
shelter
with
their
arms
and
provisions
in
the
cave
they
found
a
store
of
dried
which
formed
a
convenient
couch
for
fire
they
lighted
some
wood
near
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
dried
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
john
hoped
that
the
duration
of
this
deluge
of
rain
would
be
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
its
violence
but
he
was
doomed
to
disappointment
hours
passed
without
any
abatement
of
its
fury
toward
noon
the
wind
freshened
and
increased
the
force
of
the
storm
the
most
patient
of
men
would
have
rebelled
at
such
an
untoward
incident
but
what
could
be
done
without
any
vehicle
they
could
not
brave
such
a
tempest
and
after
all
unless
the
natives
appeared
on
the
scene
a
delay
of
twelve
hours
was
not
so
much
consequence
as
the
journey
to
auckland
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
days
during
this
involuntary
halt
the
conversation
turned
on
the
incidents
of
the
new
zealand
war
but
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
critical
position
into
which
these
macquarie
passengers
were
thrown
something
ought
to
be
known
of
the
history
of
the
struggle
which
had
deluged
the
island
of
with
blood
since
the
arrival
of
abel
tasman
in
cook
s
strait
on
the
of
december
though
the
new
zealanders
had
often
been
visited
by
european
vessels
they
had
maintained
their
liberty
in
their
several
islands
no
european
power
had
thought
of
taking
possession
of
this
archipelago
which
commands
the
whole
pacific
ocean
the
missionaries
stationed
at
various
points
were
the
sole
channels
of
christian
civilization
some
of
them
especially
the
anglicans
prepared
the
minds
of
the
new
zealand
chiefs
for
submitting
to
the
english
yoke
it
was
cleverly
managed
and
these
chiefs
were
influenced
to
sign
a
letter
addressed
to
queen
victoria
to
ask
her
protection
but
the
most
clearsighted
of
them
saw
the
folly
of
this
step
and
one
of
them
after
having
affixed
his
to
the
letter
by
way
of
signature
uttered
these
prophetic
words
we
have
lost
our
country
henceforth
it
is
not
ours
soon
the
stranger
will
come
and
take
it
and
we
shall
be
his
and
so
it
was
on
january
the
english
corvette
herald
arrived
to
claim
possession
from
the
year
till
the
day
the
duncan
left
the
clyde
nothing
had
happened
here
that
paganel
did
not
know
and
he
was
ready
to
impart
his
information
to
his
companions
madam
said
he
in
answer
to
lady
helena
s
questions
i
must
repeat
what
i
had
occasion
to
remark
before
that
the
new
zealanders
are
a
courageous
people
who
yielded
for
a
moment
but
afterward
fought
foot
to
foot
against
the
english
invaders
the
maori
tribes
are
organized
like
the
old
clans
of
scotland
they
are
so
many
great
families
owning
a
chief
who
is
very
jealous
of
his
prerogative
the
men
of
this
race
are
proud
and
brave
one
tribe
tall
with
straight
hair
like
the
maltese
or
the
jews
of
bagdad
the
other
smaller
thickset
like
mulattoes
but
robust
haughty
and
warlike
they
had
a
famous
chief
named
hihi
a
real
vercingetorix
so
that
you
need
not
be
astonished
that
the
war
with
the
english
has
become
chronic
in
the
northern
island
for
in
it
is
the
famous
tribe
of
the
waikatos
who
defend
their
lands
under
the
leadership
of
william
but
said
john
mangles
are
not
the
english
in
possession
of
the
principal
points
in
new
zealand
certainly
dear
john
replied
paganel
after
captain
hobson
took
formal
possession
and
became
governor
nine
colonies
were
founded
at
various
times
between
and
in
the
most
favorable
situations
these
formed
the
nucleus
of
nine
provinces
four
in
the
north
island
and
five
in
the
southern
island
with
a
total
population
of
inhabitants
on
the
of
june
but
what
about
this
interminable
war
asked
john
mangles
well
said
paganel
six
long
months
have
gone
by
since
we
left
europe
and
i
can
not
say
what
may
have
happened
during
that
time
with
the
exception
of
a
few
facts
which
i
gathered
from
the
newspapers
of
maryborough
and
seymour
during
our
australian
journey
at
that
time
the
fighting
was
very
lively
in
the
northern
and
when
did
the
war
commence
asked
mary
grant
recommence
you
mean
my
dear
young
lady
replied
paganel
for
there
was
an
insurrection
so
far
back
as
the
present
war
began
toward
the
close
of
but
long
before
that
date
the
maories
were
occupied
in
making
preparations
to
shake
off
the
english
yoke
the
national
party
among
the
natives
carried
on
an
active
propaganda
for
the
election
of
a
maori
ruler
the
object
was
to
make
old
potatau
king
and
to
fix
as
the
capital
of
the
new
kingdom
his
village
which
lay
between
the
waikato
and
waipa
rivers
potatau
was
an
old
man
remarkable
rather
for
cunning
than
bravery
but
he
had
a
prime
minister
who
was
both
intelligent
and
energetic
a
descendant
of
the
ngatihahuas
who
occupied
the
isthmus
before
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
this
minister
william
thompson
became
the
soul
of
the
war
of
independence
and
organized
the
maori
troops
with
great
skill
under
this
guidance
a
taranaki
chief
gathered
the
scattered
tribes
around
the
same
flag
a
waikato
chief
formed
a
land
league
intended
to
prevent
the
natives
from
selling
their
land
to
the
english
government
and
warlike
feasts
were
held
just
as
in
civilized
countries
on
the
verge
of
revolution
the
english
newspapers
began
to
notice
these
alarming
symptoms
and
the
government
became
seriously
disturbed
at
these
land
league
proceedings
in
short
the
train
was
laid
and
the
mine
was
ready
to
explode
nothing
was
wanted
but
the
spark
or
rather
the
shock
of
rival
interests
to
produce
the
spark
this
shock
took
place
in
in
the
taranaki
province
on
the
southwest
coast
of
a
native
had
six
hundred
acres
of
land
in
the
neighborhood
of
new
plymouth
he
sold
them
to
the
english
government
but
when
the
surveyor
came
to
measure
the
purchased
land
the
chief
kingi
protested
and
by
the
month
of
march
he
had
made
the
six
hundred
acres
in
question
into
a
fortified
camp
surrounded
with
high
palisades
some
days
after
colonel
gold
carried
this
fortress
at
the
head
of
his
troops
and
that
day
heard
the
first
shot
fired
of
the
native
have
the
rebels
been
successful
up
to
this
time
yes
madam
and
the
english
themselves
have
often
been
compelled
to
admire
the
courage
and
bravery
of
the
new
zealanders
their
mode
of
warfare
is
of
the
guerilla
type
they
form
skirmishing
parties
come
down
in
small
detachments
and
pillage
the
colonists
homes
general
cameron
had
no
easy
time
in
the
campaigns
during
which
every
bush
had
to
be
searched
in
after
a
long
and
sanguinary
struggle
the
maories
were
entrenched
in
strong
and
fortified
position
on
the
upper
waikato
at
the
end
of
a
chain
of
steep
hills
and
covered
by
three
miles
of
forts
the
native
prophets
called
on
all
the
maori
population
to
defend
the
soil
and
promised
the
extermination
of
the
pakekas
or
white
men
general
cameron
had
three
thousand
volunteers
at
his
disposal
and
they
gave
no
quarter
to
the
maories
after
the
barbarous
murder
of
captain
sprent
several
bloody
engagements
took
place
in
some
instances
the
fighting
lasted
twelve
hours
before
the
maories
yielded
to
the
english
cannonade
the
heart
of
the
army
was
the
fierce
waikato
tribe
under
william
thompson
this
native
general
commanded
at
the
outset
warriors
afterward
increased
to
the
men
of
shongi
and
heki
two
powerful
chiefs
came
to
his
assistance
the
women
took
their
part
in
the
most
trying
labors
of
this
patriotic
war
but
right
has
not
always
might
after
severe
struggles
general
cameron
succeeded
in
subduing
the
waikato
district
but
empty
and
depopulated
for
the
maories
escaped
in
all
directions
some
wonderful
exploits
were
related
four
hundred
maories
who
were
shut
up
in
the
fortress
of
orakau
besieged
by
english
under
carey
without
water
or
provisions
refused
to
surrender
but
one
day
at
noon
cut
their
way
through
the
then
decimated
regiment
and
escaped
to
the
but
asked
john
mangles
did
the
submission
of
the
waikato
district
put
an
end
to
this
sanguinary
war
no
my
friend
replied
paganel
the
english
resolved
to
march
on
taranaki
province
and
besiege
mataitawa
william
thompson
s
fortress
but
they
did
not
carry
it
without
great
loss
just
as
i
was
leaving
paris
i
heard
that
the
governor
and
the
general
had
accepted
the
submission
of
the
tauranga
tribes
and
left
them
in
possession
of
of
their
lands
it
was
also
rumored
that
the
principal
chief
of
the
rebellion
william
thompson
was
inclined
to
surrender
but
the
australian
papers
have
not
confirmed
this
but
rather
the
contrary
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
at
this
moment
the
war
is
going
on
with
renewed
then
according
to
you
paganel
said
glenarvan
this
struggle
is
still
going
on
in
the
provinces
of
auckland
and
taranaki
i
think
this
very
province
where
the
macquarie
s
wreck
has
deposited
exactly
we
have
landed
a
few
miles
above
kawhia
harbor
where
the
maori
flag
is
probably
still
then
our
most
prudent
course
would
be
to
keep
toward
the
north
remarked
glenarvan
by
far
the
most
prudent
said
paganel
the
new
zealanders
are
incensed
against
europeans
and
especially
against
the
english
therefore
let
us
avoid
falling
into
their
we
might
have
the
good
fortune
to
fall
in
with
a
detachment
of
european
troops
said
lady
helena
we
may
madam
replied
the
geographer
but
i
do
not
expect
it
detached
parties
do
not
like
to
go
far
into
the
country
where
the
smallest
tussock
the
thinnest
brushwood
may
conceal
an
accomplished
marksman
i
don
t
fancy
we
shall
pick
up
an
escort
of
the
regiment
but
there
are
on
this
west
coast
and
we
shall
be
able
to
make
them
our
till
we
get
to
chapter
viii
on
the
road
to
auckland
on
the
of
february
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
signal
for
departure
was
given
by
glenarvan
during
the
night
the
rain
had
ceased
the
sky
was
veiled
with
light
gray
clouds
which
moderated
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
allowed
the
travelers
to
venture
on
a
journey
by
day
paganel
had
measured
on
the
map
a
distance
of
eighty
miles
between
point
kawhia
and
auckland
it
was
an
eight
days
journey
if
they
made
ten
miles
a
day
but
instead
of
following
the
windings
of
the
coast
he
thought
it
better
to
make
for
a
point
thirty
miles
off
at
the
confluence
of
the
waikato
and
the
waipa
at
the
village
of
ngarnavahia
the
overland
track
passes
that
point
and
is
rather
a
path
than
a
road
practicable
for
the
vehicles
which
go
almost
across
the
island
from
napier
in
hawke
s
bay
to
auckland
from
this
village
it
would
be
easy
to
reach
drury
and
there
they
could
rest
in
an
excellent
hotel
highly
recommended
by
hochstetter
the
travelers
each
carrying
a
share
of
the
provisions
commenced
to
follow
the
shore
of
aotea
bay
from
prudential
motives
they
did
not
allow
themselves
to
straggle
and
by
instinct
they
kept
a
over
the
undulating
plains
to
the
eastward
ready
with
their
loaded
carbines
paganel
map
in
hand
took
a
professional
pleasure
in
verifying
the
minutest
details
the
country
looked
like
an
immense
prairie
which
faded
into
distance
and
promised
an
easy
walk
but
the
travelers
were
undeceived
when
they
came
to
the
edge
of
this
verdant
plain
the
grass
gave
way
to
a
low
scrub
of
small
bushes
bearing
little
white
flowers
mixed
with
those
innumerable
tall
ferns
with
which
the
lands
of
new
zealand
abound
they
had
to
cut
a
path
across
the
plain
through
these
woody
stems
and
this
was
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
but
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
first
slopes
of
the
hakarihoata
ranges
were
turned
and
the
party
camped
immediately
after
a
fourteen
miles
march
they
might
well
think
of
resting
neither
wagon
or
tent
being
available
they
sought
repose
beneath
some
magnificent
norfolk
island
pines
they
had
plenty
of
rugs
which
make
good
beds
glenarvan
took
every
possible
precaution
for
the
night
his
companions
and
he
well
armed
were
to
watch
in
turns
two
and
two
till
daybreak
no
fires
were
lighted
barriers
of
fire
are
a
potent
preservation
from
wild
beasts
but
new
zealand
has
neither
tiger
nor
lion
nor
bear
nor
any
wild
animal
but
the
maori
adequately
fills
their
place
and
a
fire
would
only
have
served
to
attract
this
jaguar
the
night
passed
pleasantly
with
the
exception
of
the
attack
of
the
called
by
the
natives
ngamu
and
the
visit
of
the
audacious
family
of
rats
who
exercised
their
teeth
on
the
provisions
next
day
on
the
of
february
paganel
rose
more
sanguine
and
almost
reconciled
to
the
country
the
maories
whom
he
particularly
dreaded
had
not
yet
appeared
and
these
ferocious
cannibals
had
not
molested
him
even
in
his
dreams
i
begin
to
think
that
our
little
journey
will
end
favorably
this
evening
we
shall
reach
the
confluence
of
the
waipa
and
waikato
and
after
that
there
is
not
much
chance
of
meeting
natives
on
the
way
to
how
far
is
it
now
said
glenarvan
to
the
confluence
of
the
waipa
and
waikato
fifteen
miles
just
about
what
we
did
but
we
shall
be
terribly
delayed
if
this
interminable
scrub
continues
to
obstruct
our
no
said
paganel
we
shall
follow
the
banks
of
the
waipa
and
then
we
shall
have
no
obstacle
but
on
the
contrary
a
very
easy
well
then
said
glenarvan
seeing
the
ladies
ready
let
us
make
a
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
the
thick
brushwood
seriously
impeded
their
progress
neither
wagon
nor
horses
could
have
passed
where
travelers
passed
so
that
their
australian
vehicle
was
but
slightly
regretted
until
practicable
wagon
roads
are
cut
through
these
forests
of
scrub
new
zealand
will
only
be
accessible
to
foot
passengers
the
ferns
whose
name
is
legion
concur
with
the
maories
in
keeping
strangers
off
the
lands
the
little
party
overcame
many
obstacles
in
crossing
the
plains
in
which
the
hakarihoata
ranges
rise
but
before
noon
they
reached
the
banks
of
the
waipa
and
followed
the
northward
course
of
the
river
the
major
and
robert
without
leaving
their
companions
shot
some
snipe
and
partridge
under
the
low
shrubs
of
the
plain
olbinett
to
save
time
plucked
the
birds
as
he
went
along
paganel
was
less
absorbed
by
the
culinary
importance
of
the
game
than
by
the
desire
of
obtaining
some
bird
peculiar
to
new
zealand
his
curiosity
as
a
naturalist
overcame
his
hunger
as
a
traveler
he
called
to
mind
the
peculiarities
of
the
tui
of
the
natives
sometimes
called
the
from
its
incessant
chuckle
and
sometimes
the
parson
in
allusion
to
the
white
cravat
it
wears
over
its
black
plumage
the
tui
said
paganel
to
the
major
grows
so
fat
during
the
winter
that
it
makes
him
ill
and
prevents
him
from
flying
then
he
tears
his
breast
with
his
beak
to
relieve
himself
of
his
fat
and
so
becomes
lighter
does
not
that
seem
to
you
singular
mcnabbs
so
singular
that
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
replied
the
major
paganel
to
his
great
regret
could
not
find
a
single
specimen
or
he
might
have
shown
the
incredulous
major
the
bloody
scars
on
the
breast
but
he
was
more
fortunate
with
a
strange
animal
which
hunted
by
men
cats
and
dogs
has
fled
toward
the
unoccupied
country
and
is
fast
disappearing
from
the
fauna
of
new
zealand
robert
searching
like
a
ferret
came
upon
a
nest
made
of
interwoven
roots
and
in
it
a
pair
of
birds
destitute
of
wings
and
tail
with
four
toes
a
long
beak
and
a
covering
of
white
feathers
over
the
whole
body
singular
creatures
which
seemed
to
connect
the
oviparous
tribes
with
the
mammifers
it
was
the
new
zealand
kiwi
the
of
naturalists
which
lives
with
equal
satisfaction
on
larvae
insects
worms
or
seeds
this
bird
is
peculiar
to
the
country
it
has
been
introduced
into
very
few
of
the
zoological
collections
of
europe
its
graceless
shape
and
comical
motions
have
always
attracted
the
notice
of
travelers
and
during
the
great
exploration
of
the
astrolabe
and
the
zelee
dumont
d
urville
was
principally
charged
by
the
academy
of
sciences
to
bring
back
a
specimen
of
these
singular
birds
but
in
spite
of
rewards
offered
to
the
natives
he
could
not
obtain
a
single
specimen
paganel
who
was
elated
at
such
a
piece
of
luck
tied
the
two
birds
together
and
carried
them
along
with
the
intention
of
presenting
them
to
the
jardin
des
plantes
in
paris
presented
by
jacques
he
mentally
saw
the
flattering
inscription
on
the
handsomest
cage
in
the
gardens
sanguine
geographer
the
party
pursued
their
way
without
fatigue
along
the
banks
of
the
waipa
the
country
was
quite
deserted
not
a
trace
of
natives
nor
any
track
that
could
betray
the
existence
of
man
the
stream
was
fringed
with
tall
bushes
or
glided
along
sloping
banks
so
that
nothing
obstructed
the
view
of
the
low
range
of
hills
which
closed
the
eastern
end
of
the
valley
with
their
grotesque
shapes
and
their
outlines
lost
in
a
deceptive
haze
they
brought
to
mind
giant
animals
worthy
of
antediluvian
times
they
might
have
been
a
herd
of
enormous
whales
suddenly
turned
to
stone
these
disrupted
masses
proclaimed
their
essentially
volcanic
character
new
zealand
is
in
fact
a
formation
of
recent
plutonic
origin
its
emergence
from
the
sea
is
constantly
increasing
some
points
are
known
to
have
risen
six
feet
in
twenty
years
fire
still
runs
across
its
center
shakes
it
convulses
it
and
finds
an
outlet
in
many
places
by
the
mouths
of
geysers
and
the
craters
of
volcanoes
at
four
in
the
afternoon
nine
miles
had
been
easily
accomplished
according
to
the
map
which
paganel
constantly
referred
to
the
confluence
of
the
waipa
and
waikato
ought
to
be
reached
about
five
miles
further
on
and
there
the
night
halt
could
be
made
two
or
three
days
would
then
suffice
for
the
fifty
miles
which
lay
between
them
and
the
capital
and
if
glenarvan
happened
to
fall
in
with
the
mail
coach
that
plies
between
hawkes
bay
and
auckland
twice
a
month
eight
hours
would
be
sufficient
therefore
said
glenarvan
we
shall
be
obliged
to
camp
during
the
night
once
yes
said
paganel
but
i
hope
for
the
last
i
am
very
glad
to
think
so
for
it
is
very
trying
for
lady
helena
and
mary
and
they
never
utter
a
murmur
added
john
mangles
but
i
think
i
heard
you
mention
a
village
at
the
confluence
of
these
yes
said
the
geographer
here
it
is
marked
on
johnston
s
map
it
is
ngarnavahia
two
miles
below
the
well
could
we
not
stay
there
for
the
night
lady
helena
and
miss
grant
would
not
grudge
two
miles
more
to
find
a
hotel
even
of
a
humble
a
hotel
cried
paganel
a
hotel
in
a
maori
village
you
would
not
find
an
inn
not
a
tavern
this
village
will
be
a
mere
cluster
of
huts
and
so
far
from
seeking
rest
there
my
advice
is
that
you
give
it
a
wide
your
old
fears
paganel
retorted
glenarvan
my
dear
lord
where
maories
are
concerned
distrust
is
safer
than
confidence
i
do
not
know
on
what
terms
they
are
with
the
english
whether
the
insurrection
is
suppressed
or
successful
or
whether
indeed
the
war
may
not
be
going
on
with
full
vigor
modesty
apart
people
like
us
would
be
a
prize
and
i
must
say
i
would
rather
forego
a
taste
of
maori
hospitality
i
think
it
certainly
more
prudent
to
avoid
this
village
of
ngarnavahia
to
skirt
it
at
a
distance
so
as
to
avoid
all
encounters
with
the
natives
when
we
reach
drury
it
will
be
another
thing
and
there
our
brave
ladies
will
be
able
to
recruit
their
strength
at
their
this
advice
prevailed
lady
helena
preferred
to
pass
another
night
in
the
open
air
and
not
to
expose
her
companions
to
danger
neither
mary
grant
or
she
wished
to
halt
and
they
continued
their
march
along
the
river
two
hours
later
the
first
shades
of
evening
began
to
fall
the
sun
before
disappearing
below
the
western
horizon
darted
some
bright
rays
through
an
opening
in
the
clouds
the
distant
eastern
summits
were
empurpled
with
the
parting
glories
of
the
day
it
was
like
a
flying
salute
addressed
to
the
travelers
glenarvan
and
his
friends
hastened
their
steps
they
knew
how
short
the
twilight
is
in
this
high
latitude
and
how
quickly
the
night
follows
it
they
were
very
anxious
to
reach
the
confluence
of
the
two
rivers
before
the
darkness
overtook
them
but
a
thick
fog
rose
from
the
ground
and
made
it
very
difficult
to
see
the
way
fortunately
hearing
stood
them
in
the
stead
of
sight
shortly
a
nearer
sound
of
water
indicated
that
the
confluence
was
at
hand
at
eight
o
clock
the
little
troop
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
waipa
loses
itself
in
the
waikato
with
a
moaning
sound
of
meeting
waves
there
is
the
waikato
cried
paganel
and
the
road
to
auckland
is
along
its
right
we
shall
see
that
said
the
major
let
us
camp
here
it
seems
to
me
that
that
dark
shadow
is
that
of
a
little
clump
of
trees
grown
expressly
to
shelter
us
let
us
have
supper
and
then
get
some
supper
by
all
means
said
paganel
but
no
fire
nothing
but
biscuit
and
dried
meat
we
have
reached
this
spot
incognito
let
us
try
and
get
away
in
the
same
manner
by
good
luck
the
fog
is
in
our
the
clump
of
trees
was
reached
and
all
concurred
in
the
wish
of
the
geographer
the
cold
supper
was
eaten
without
a
sound
and
presently
a
profound
sleep
overcame
the
travelers
who
were
tolerably
fatigued
with
their
fifteen
miles
march
chapter
ix
introduction
to
the
cannibals
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
a
thick
fog
was
clinging
to
the
surface
of
the
river
a
portion
of
the
vapors
that
saturated
the
air
were
condensed
by
the
cold
and
lay
as
a
dense
cloud
on
the
water
but
the
rays
of
the
sun
soon
broke
through
the
watery
mass
and
melted
it
away
a
tongue
of
land
sharply
pointed
and
bristling
with
bushes
projected
into
the
uniting
streams
the
swifter
waters
of
the
waipa
rushed
against
the
current
of
the
waikato
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
they
mingled
with
it
but
the
calm
and
majestic
river
soon
quieted
the
noisy
stream
and
carried
it
off
quietly
in
its
course
to
the
pacific
ocean
when
the
vapor
disappeared
a
boat
was
seen
ascending
the
current
of
the
waikato
it
was
a
canoe
seventy
feet
long
five
broad
and
three
deep
the
prow
raised
like
that
of
a
venetian
gondola
and
the
whole
hollowed
out
of
a
trunk
of
a
kahikatea
a
bed
of
dry
fern
was
laid
at
the
bottom
it
was
swiftly
rowed
by
eight
oars
and
steered
with
a
paddle
by
a
man
seated
in
the
stern
this
man
was
a
tall
maori
about
years
of
age
muscular
with
powerfully
developed
hands
and
feet
his
prominent
and
brow
his
fierce
look
and
sinister
expression
gave
him
a
formidable
aspect
tattooing
or
moko
as
the
new
zealanders
call
it
is
a
mark
of
great
distinction
none
is
worthy
of
these
honorary
lines
who
has
not
distinguished
himself
in
repeated
fights
the
slaves
and
the
lower
class
can
not
obtain
this
decoration
chiefs
of
high
position
may
be
known
by
the
finish
and
precision
and
truth
of
the
design
which
sometimes
covers
their
whole
bodies
with
the
figures
of
animals
some
are
found
to
undergo
the
painful
operation
of
moko
five
times
the
more
illustrious
the
more
illustrated
is
the
rule
of
new
zealand
dumont
d
urville
has
given
some
curious
details
as
to
this
custom
he
justly
observes
that
moko
is
the
counterpart
of
the
armorial
bearings
of
which
many
families
in
europe
are
so
vain
but
he
remarks
that
there
is
this
difference
the
armorial
bearings
of
europe
are
frequently
a
proof
only
of
the
merits
of
the
first
who
bore
them
and
are
no
certificate
of
the
merits
of
his
descendants
while
the
individual
of
the
maori
is
an
irrefragible
proof
that
it
was
earned
by
the
display
of
extraordinary
personal
courage
the
practice
of
tattooing
independently
of
the
consideration
it
procures
has
also
a
useful
aspect
it
gives
the
cutaneous
system
an
increased
thickness
enabling
it
to
resist
the
inclemency
of
the
season
and
the
incessant
attacks
of
the
mosquito
as
to
the
chief
who
was
steering
the
canoe
there
could
be
no
mistake
the
sharpened
albatross
bone
used
by
the
maori
tattooer
had
five
times
scored
his
countenance
he
was
in
his
fifth
edition
and
betrayed
it
in
his
haughty
bearing
his
figure
draped
in
a
large
mat
woven
of
phormium
trimmed
with
dogskins
was
clothed
with
a
pair
of
cotton
drawers
from
recent
combats
from
the
pendant
lobe
of
his
ears
hung
earrings
of
green
jade
and
round
his
neck
a
quivering
necklace
of
pounamous
a
kind
of
jade
stone
sacred
among
the
new
zealanders
at
his
side
lay
an
english
rifle
and
a
a
kind
of
ax
of
an
emerald
color
and
eighteen
inches
long
beside
him
sat
nine
armed
warriors
of
inferior
rank
fellows
some
of
them
suffering
from
recent
wounds
they
sat
quite
motionless
wrapped
in
their
flax
mantles
three
dogs
lay
at
their
feet
the
eight
rowers
in
the
prow
seemed
to
be
servants
or
slaves
of
the
chief
they
rowed
vigorously
and
propelled
the
boat
against
the
not
very
rapid
current
of
the
waikato
with
extraordinary
velocity
in
the
center
of
this
long
canoe
with
their
feet
tied
together
sat
ten
european
prisoners
closely
packed
together
it
was
glenarvan
and
lady
helena
mary
grant
robert
paganel
the
major
john
mangles
the
steward
and
the
two
sailors
the
night
before
the
little
band
had
unwittingly
owing
to
the
mist
encamped
in
the
midst
of
a
numerous
party
of
natives
toward
the
middle
of
the
night
they
were
surprised
in
their
sleep
were
made
prisoners
and
carried
on
board
the
canoe
they
had
not
been
so
far
but
all
attempts
at
resistance
had
been
vain
their
arms
and
ammunition
were
in
the
hands
of
the
savages
and
they
would
soon
have
been
targets
for
their
own
balls
they
were
soon
aware
from
a
few
english
words
used
by
the
natives
that
they
were
a
retreating
party
of
the
tribe
who
had
been
beaten
and
decimated
by
the
english
troops
and
were
on
their
way
back
to
the
upper
waikato
the
maori
chief
whose
principal
warriors
had
been
picked
off
by
the
soldiers
of
the
regiment
was
returning
to
make
a
final
appeal
to
the
tribes
of
the
waikato
district
so
that
he
might
go
to
the
aid
of
the
indomitable
william
thompson
who
was
still
holding
his
own
against
the
conquerors
the
chief
s
name
was
a
name
of
evil
boding
in
the
native
language
meaning
he
who
eats
the
limbs
of
his
he
was
bold
and
brave
but
his
cruelty
was
equally
remarkable
no
pity
was
to
be
expected
at
his
hands
his
name
was
well
known
to
the
english
soldiers
and
a
price
had
been
set
on
his
head
by
the
governor
of
new
zealand
this
terrible
blow
befell
glenarvan
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
about
to
reach
the
haven
of
auckland
and
so
regain
his
own
country
but
no
one
who
looked
at
his
cool
calm
features
could
have
guessed
the
anguish
he
endured
glenarvan
always
rose
to
his
misfortunes
he
felt
that
his
part
was
to
be
the
strength
and
the
example
of
his
wife
and
companions
that
he
was
the
head
and
chief
ready
to
die
for
the
rest
if
circumstances
required
it
he
was
of
a
deeply
religious
turn
of
mind
and
never
lost
his
trust
in
providence
nor
his
belief
in
the
sacred
character
of
his
enterprise
in
the
midst
of
this
crowning
peril
he
did
not
give
way
to
any
feeling
of
regret
at
having
been
induced
to
venture
into
this
country
of
savages
his
companions
were
worthy
of
him
they
entered
into
his
lofty
views
and
judging
by
their
haughty
demeanor
it
would
scarcely
have
been
supposed
that
they
were
hurrying
to
the
final
catastrophe
with
one
accord
and
by
glenarvan
s
advice
they
resolved
to
affect
utter
indifference
before
the
natives
it
was
the
only
way
to
impress
these
ferocious
natures
savages
in
general
and
particularly
the
maories
have
a
notion
of
dignity
from
which
they
never
derogate
they
respect
above
all
things
coolness
and
courage
glenarvan
was
aware
that
by
this
mode
of
procedure
he
and
his
companions
would
spare
themselves
needless
humiliation
from
the
moment
of
embarking
the
natives
who
were
very
taciturn
like
all
savages
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
word
but
from
the
few
sentences
they
did
utter
glenarvan
felt
certain
that
the
english
language
was
familiar
to
them
he
therefore
made
up
his
mind
to
question
the
chief
on
the
fate
that
awaited
them
addressing
himself
to
he
said
in
a
perfectly
unconcerned
voice
where
are
we
going
chief
looked
coolly
at
him
and
made
no
answer
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
us
pursued
glenarvan
a
sudden
gleam
flashed
into
the
eyes
of
and
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
exchange
you
if
your
own
people
care
to
have
you
eat
you
if
they
don
glenarvan
asked
no
further
questions
but
hope
revived
in
his
heart
he
concluded
that
some
maori
chiefs
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
english
and
that
the
natives
would
try
to
get
them
exchanged
so
they
had
a
chance
of
salvation
and
the
case
was
not
quite
so
desperate
the
canoe
was
speeding
rapidly
up
the
river
paganel
whose
excitable
temperament
always
rebounded
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
had
quite
regained
his
spirits
he
consoled
himself
that
the
natives
were
saving
them
the
trouble
of
the
journey
to
the
english
outposts
and
that
was
so
much
gain
so
he
took
it
quite
quietly
and
followed
on
the
map
the
course
of
the
waikato
across
the
plains
and
valleys
of
the
province
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
concealing
their
alarm
conversed
in
a
low
voice
with
glenarvan
and
the
keenest
physiognomists
would
have
failed
to
see
any
anxiety
in
their
faces
the
waikato
is
the
national
river
in
new
zealand
it
is
to
the
maories
what
the
rhine
is
to
the
germans
and
the
danube
to
the
slavs
in
its
course
of
miles
it
waters
the
finest
lands
of
the
north
island
from
the
province
of
wellington
to
the
province
of
auckland
it
gave
its
name
to
all
those
indomitable
tribes
of
the
river
district
which
rose
against
the
invaders
the
waters
of
this
river
are
still
almost
strangers
to
any
craft
but
the
native
canoe
the
most
audacious
tourist
will
scarcely
venture
to
invade
these
sacred
shores
in
fact
the
upper
waikato
is
sealed
against
profane
europeans
paganel
was
aware
of
the
feelings
of
veneration
with
which
the
natives
regard
this
great
arterial
stream
he
knew
that
the
english
and
german
naturalists
had
never
penetrated
further
than
its
junction
with
the
waipa
he
wondered
how
far
the
good
pleasure
of
would
carry
his
captives
he
could
not
have
guessed
but
for
hearing
the
word
taupo
repeatedly
uttered
between
the
chief
and
his
warriors
he
consulted
his
map
and
saw
that
taupo
was
the
name
of
a
lake
celebrated
in
geographical
annals
and
lying
in
the
most
mountainous
part
of
the
island
at
the
southern
extremity
of
auckland
province
the
waikato
passes
through
this
lake
and
then
flows
on
for
miles
chapter
x
a
momentous
interview
an
unfathomable
gulf
miles
long
and
twenty
miles
broad
was
produced
but
long
before
historic
times
by
the
falling
in
of
caverns
among
the
trachytic
lavas
of
the
center
of
the
island
and
these
waters
falling
from
the
surrounding
heights
have
taken
possession
of

whose
roaring

rival
the
cyclones
of

the
whole

boils
like

immense

hung
over

the

like

quickly
baked
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
on
a
craggy
spur
of
the
mountain
stood
a
pah
or
maori
fortress
the
prisoners
whose
feet
and
hands
were
liberated
were
landed
one
by
one
and
conducted
into
it
by
the
warriors
the
path
which
led
up
to
the
intrenchment
lay
across
fields
of
phormium
and
a
grove
of
beautiful
trees
the

and

dracaenas

large

with
metallic
sheen
on
their
plumage
and
a
world
of
starlings
with
reddish
carmeles
flew
away
at
the
approach
of
the
natives
after
a
rather
circuitous
walk
glenarvan
and
his
party
arrived
at
the
the
fortress
was
defended
by
an
outer
inclosure
of
strong
palisades
fifteen
feet
high
a
second
line
of
stakes
then
a
fence
composed
of
osiers
with
inclosed
verne
the
inner
space
that
is
the
plateau
of
the
pah
on
which
were
erected
the
maori
buildings
and
about
forty
huts
arranged
symmetrically
when
the
captives
approached
they
were
at
the
sight
of
the
heads
which
adorned
the
posts
of
the
inner
circle
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
turned
away
their
eyes
more
with
disgust
than
with
terror
these
heads
were
those
of
hostile
chiefs
who
had
fallen
in
battle
and
whose
bodies
had
served
to
feed
the
conquerors
the
geographer
recognized
that
it
was
so
from
their
eye
sockets
being
hollow
and
deprived
of
glenarvan
and
his
companions
had
taken
in
all
this
scene
at
a
glance
they
stood
near
an
empty
house
waiting
the
pleasure
of
the
chief
and
exposed
to
the
abuse
of
a
crowd
of
old
crones
this
troop
of
harpies
surrounded
them
shaking
their
fists
howling
and
vociferating
some
english
words
that
escaped
their
coarse
mouths
left
no
doubt
that
they
were
clamoring
for
immediate
vengeance
in
the
midst
of
all
these
cries
and
threats
lady
helena
tranquil
to
all
outward
seeming
affected
an
indifference
she
was
far
from
feeling
this
courageous
woman
made
heroic
efforts
to
restrain
herself
lest
she
should
disturb
glenarvan
s
coolness
poor
mary
grant
felt
her
heart
sink
within
her
and
john
mangles
stood
by
ready
to
die
in
her
behalf
his
companions
bore
the
deluge
of
invectives
each
according
to
his
disposition
the
major
with
utter
indifference
paganel
with
exasperation
that
increased
every
moment
glenarvan
to
spare
lady
helena
the
attacks
of
these
witches
walked
straight
up
to
and
pointing
to
the
hideous
group
send
them
away
said
he
the
maori
chief
stared
fixedly
at
his
prisoner
without
speaking
and
then
with
a
nod
he
silenced
the
noisy
horde
glenarvan
bowed
as
a
sign
of
thanks
and
went
slowly
back
to
his
place
at
this
moment
a
hundred
maories
were
assembled
in
the
pah
old
men
full
grown
men
youths
the
former
were
calm
but
gloomy
awaiting
the
orders
of
the
others
gave
themselves
up
to
the
most
violent
sorrow
bewailing
their
parents
and
friends
who
had
fallen
in
the
late
engagements
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
chiefs
that
obeyed
the
call
of
william
thompson
who
had
returned
to
the
lake
district
and
he
was
the
first
to
announce
to
his
tribe
the
defeat
of
the
national
insurrection
beaten
on
the
plains
of
the
lower
waikato
of
the
two
hundred
warriors
who
under
his
orders
hastened
to
the
defence
of
the
soil
one
hundred
and
fifty
were
missing
on
his
return
allowing
for
a
number
being
made
prisoners
by
the
invaders
how
many
must
be
lying
on
the
field
of
battle
never
to
return
to
the
country
of
their
ancestors
this
was
the
secret
of
the
outburst
of
grief
with
which
the
tribe
saluted
the
arrival
of
up
to
that
moment
nothing
had
been
known
of
the
last
defeat
and
the
fatal
news
fell
on
them
like
a
thunder
clap
among
the
savages
sorrow
is
always
manifested
by
physical
signs
the
parents
and
friends
of
deceased
warriors
the
women
especially
lacerated
their
faces
and
shoulders
with
sharpened
shells
the
blood
spurted
out
and
blended
with
their
tears
deep
wounds
denoted
great
despair
the
unhappy
maories
bleeding
and
excited
were
hideous
to
look
upon
there
was
another
serious
element
in
their
grief
not
only
had
they
lost
the
relative
or
friend
they
mourned
but
his
bones
would
be
missing
in
the
family
mausoleum
in
the
maori
religion
the
possession
of
these
relics
is
regarded
as
indispensable
to
the
destinies
of
the
future
life
not
the
perishable
flesh
but
the
bones
which
are
collected
with
the
greatest
care
cleaned
scraped
polished
even
varnished
and
then
deposited
in
the
oudoupa
that
is
the
house
of
these
tombs
are
adorned
with
wooden
statues
representing
with
perfect
exactness
the
tattoo
of
the
deceased
but
now
their
tombs
would
be
left
empty
the
religious
rites
would
be
unsolemnized
and
the
bones
that
escaped
the
teeth
of
the
wild
dog
would
whiten
without
burial
on
the
field
of
battle
then
the
sorrowful
chorus
redoubled
the
menaces
of
the
women
were
intensified
by
the
imprecations
of
the
men
against
the
europeans
abusive
epithets
were
lavished
the
accompanying
gestures
became
more
violent
the
howl
was
about
to
end
in
brutal
action
fearing
that
he
might
be
overpowered
by
the
fanatics
of
his
tribe
conducted
his
prisoners
to
a
sacred
place
on
an
abruptly
raised
plateau
at
the
other
end
of
the
this
hut
rested
against
a
mound
elevated
a
hundred
feet
above
it
which
formed
the
steep
outer
buttress
of
the
entrenchment
in
this
sacred
house
the
priests
or
arikis
taught
the
maories
about
a
triune
god
father
son
and
bird
or
spirit
the
large
well
constructed
hut
contained
the
sacred
and
choice
food
which
eats
by
the
mouths
of
his
priests
in
this
place
and
safe
for
the
moment
from
the
frenzied
natives
the
captives
lay
down
on
the
flax
mats
lady
helena
was
quite
exhausted
her
moral
energies
prostrate
and
she
fell
helpless
into
her
husband
s
arms
glenarvan
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
and
said
courage
my
dear
helena
heaven
will
not
forsake
us
robert
was
scarcely
in
when
he
jumped
on
wilson
s
shoulders
and
squeezed
his
head
through
a
crevice
left
between
the
roof
and
the
walls
from
which
chaplets
of
amulets
were
hung
from
that
elevation
he
could
see
the
whole
extent
of
the
pah
and
as
far
as
s
house
they
are
all
crowding
round
the
chief
said
he
softly
they
are
throwing
their
arms
about
they
are
howling
is
trying
to
then
he
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
is
speaking
the
savages
are
quieter
they
are
listening
evidently
said
the
major
this
chief
has
a
personal
interest
in
protecting
us
he
wants
to
exchange
his
prisoners
for
some
chiefs
of
his
tribe
but
will
his
warriors
consent
yes
they
are
listening
they
have
dispersed
some
are
gone
into
their
huts
the
others
have
left
the
are
you
sure
said
the
major
yes
mcnabbs
replied
robert
is
left
alone
with
the
warriors
of
his
canoe
oh
one
of
them
is
coming
up
here
come
down
robert
said
glenarvan
at
this
moment
lady
helena
who
had
risen
seized
her
husband
s
arm
edward
she
said
in
a
resolute
tone
neither
mary
grant
nor
i
must
fall
into
the
hands
of
these
savages
alive
and
so
saying
she
handed
glenarvan
a
loaded
revolver
exclaimed
glenarvan
with
flashing
eyes
yes
the
maories
do
not
search
their
prisoners
but
edward
this
is
for
us
not
for
glenarvan
slipped
the
revolver
under
his
coat
at
the
same
moment
the
mat
at
the
entrance
was
raised
and
a
native
entered
he
motioned
to
the
prisoners
to
follow
him
glenarvan
and
the
rest
walked
across
the
pah
and
stopped
before
he
was
surrounded
by
the
principal
warriors
of
his
tribe
and
among
them
the
maori
whose
canoe
joined
that
of
the
at
the
confluence
of
on
the
waikato
he
was
a
man
about
forty
years
of
age
powerfully
built
and
of
fierce
and
cruel
aspect
his
name
was
meaning
the
irascible
in
the
native
tongue
treated
him
with
a
certain
tone
of
respect
and
by
the
fineness
of
his
tattoo
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
held
a
lofty
position
in
the
tribe
but
a
keen
observer
would
have
guessed
the
feeling
of
rivalry
that
existed
between
these
two
chiefs
the
major
observed
that
the
influence
of
gave
umbrage
to
they
both
ruled
the
waikato
tribes
and
were
equal
in
authority
during
this
interview
smiled
but
his
eyes
betrayed
a
enmity
interrogated
glenarvan
you
are
english
said
he
yes
replied
glenarvan
unhesitatingly
as
his
nationality
would
facilitate
the
exchange
and
your
companions
said
my
companions
are
english
like
myself
we
are
shipwrecked
travelers
but
it
may
be
important
to
state
that
we
have
taken
no
part
in
the
that
matters
little
was
the
brutal
answer
of
every
englishman
is
an
enemy
your
people
invaded
our
island
they
robbed
our
fields
they
burned
our
villages
they
were
wrong
said
glenarvan
quietly
i
say
so
because
i
think
it
not
because
i
am
in
your
listen
said
the
tohonga
the
chief
priest
of
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
your
brethren
he
is
a
prisoner
among
the
pakekas
our
deity
has
commanded
us
to
ransom
him
for
my
own
part
i
would
rather
have
torn
out
your
heart
i
would
have
stuck
your
head
and
those
of
your
companions
on
the
posts
of
that
palisade
but
has
as
he
uttered
these
words
who
till
now
had
been
quite
unmoved
trembled
with
rage
and
his
features
expressed
intense
ferocity
then
after
a
few
minutes
interval
he
proceeded
more
calmly
do
you
think
the
english
will
exchange
you
for
our
tohonga
glenarvan
hesitated
all
the
while
watching
the
maori
chief
i
do
not
know
said
he
after
a
moment
of
silence
speak
returned
is
your
life
worth
that
of
our
tohonga
no
replied
glenarvan
i
am
neither
a
chief
nor
a
priest
among
my
own
paganel
petrified
at
this
reply
looked
at
glenarvan
in
amazement
appeared
equally
astonished
you
doubt
it
then
said
he
i
do
not
know
replied
glenarvan
your
people
will
not
accept
you
as
an
exchange
for
tohonga
me
alone
no
repeated
glenarvan
all
of
us
perhaps
they
our
maori
custom
replied
is
head
for
offer
first
these
ladies
in
exchange
for
your
priest
said
glenarvan
pointing
to
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
lady
helena
was
about
to
interrupt
him
but
the
major
held
her
back
those
two
ladies
continued
glenarvan
bowing
respectfully
toward
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
are
personages
of
rank
in
their
own
the
warrior
gazed
coldly
at
his
prisoner
an
evil
smile
relaxed
his
lips
for
a
moment
then
he
controlled
himself
and
in
a
voice
of
anger
do
you
hope
to
deceive
with
lying
words
accursed
pakeka
can
not
the
eyes
of
read
hearts
and
pointing
to
lady
helena
that
is
your
wife
he
said
no
mine
exclaimed
and
then
pushing
his
prisoners
aside
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
lady
helena
who
turned
pale
at
his
touch
edward
cried
the
unfortunate
woman
in
terror
glenarvan
without
a
word
raised
his
arm
a
shot
and
fell
at
his
feet
the
sound
brought
a
crowd
of
natives
to
the
spot
a
hundred
arms
were
ready
and
glenarvan
s
revolver
was
snatched
from
him
glanced
at
glenarvan
with
a
curious
expression
then
with
one
hand
protecting
glenarvan
with
the
other
he
waved
off
the
crowd
who
were
rushing
on
the
party
at
last
his
voice
was
heard
above
the
tumult
taboo
taboo
he
shouted
at
that
word
the
crowd
stood
still
before
glenarvan
and
his
companions
who
for
the
time
were
preserved
by
a
supernatural
influence
a
few
minutes
after
they
were
to
which
was
their
prison
but
robert
grant
and
paganel
were
not
with
them
chapter
xi
the
chief
s
funeral
as
frequently
happens
among
the
maories
joined
the
title
of
ariki
to
that
of
tribal
chief
he
was
invested
with
the
dignity
of
priest
and
as
such
he
had
the
power
to
throw
over
persons
or
things
the
superstitious
protection
of
the
the
taboo
which
is
common
to
all
the
polynesian
races
has
the
primary
effect
of
isolating
the
tabooed
person
and
preventing
the
use
of
tabooed
things
according
to
the
maori
doctrine
anyone
who
laid
sacrilegious
hands
on
what
had
been
declared
taboo
would
be
punished
with
death
by
the
insulted
deity
and
even
if
the
god
delayed
the
vindication
of
his
power
the
priests
took
care
to
accelerate
his
vengeance
by
the
chiefs
the
taboo
is
made
a
political
engine
except
in
some
cases
for
domestic
reasons
for
instance
a
native
is
tabooed
for
several
days
when
his
hair
is
cut
when
he
is
tattooed
when
he
is
building
a
canoe
or
a
house
when
he
is
seriously
ill
and
when
he
is
dead
if
excessive
consumption
threatens
to
exterminate
the
fish
of
a
river
or
ruin
the
early
crop
of
sweet
potatoes
these
things
are
put
under
the
protection
of
the
taboo
if
a
chief
wishes
to
clear
his
house
of
he
taboos
it
if
an
english
trader
displeases
him
he
is
tabooed
his
interdict
has
the
effect
of
the
old
royal
if
an
object
is
tabooed
no
one
can
touch
it
with
impunity
when
a
native
is
under
the
interdict
certain
aliments
are
denied
him
for
a
prescribed
period
if
he
is
relieved
as
regards
the
severe
diet
his
slaves
feed
him
with
the
viands
he
is
forbidden
to
touch
with
his
hands
if
he
is
poor
and
has
no
slaves
he
has
to
take
up
the
food
with
his
mouth
like
an
animal
in
short
the
most
trifling
acts
of
the
maories
are
directed
and
modified
by
this
singular
custom
the
deity
is
brought
into
constant
contact
with
their
daily
life
the
taboo
has
the
same
weight
as
a
law
or
rather
the
code
of
the
maories
indisputable
and
undisputed
is
comprised
in
the
frequent
applications
of
the
taboo
as
to
the
prisoners
confined
in
the
it
was
an
arbitrary
taboo
which
had
saved
them
from
the
fury
of
the
tribe
some
of
the
natives
friends
and
partisans
of
desisted
at
once
on
hearing
their
chief
s
voice
and
protected
the
captives
from
the
rest
glenarvan
cherished
no
illusive
hopes
as
to
his
own
fate
nothing
but
his
death
could
atone
for
the
murder
of
a
chief
and
among
these
people
death
was
only
the
concluding
act
of
a
martyrdom
of
torture
glenarvan
therefore
was
fully
prepared
to
pay
the
penalty
of
the
righteous
indignation
that
nerved
his
arm
but
he
hoped
that
the
wrath
of
would
not
extend
beyond
himself
what
a
night
he
and
his
companions
passed
who
could
picture
their
agonies
or
measure
their
sufferings
robert
and
paganel
had
not
been
restored
to
them
but
their
fate
was
no
doubtful
matter
they
were
too
surely
the
first
victims
of
the
frenzied
natives
even
mcnabbs
who
was
always
sanguine
had
abandoned
hope

was
nearly
frantic
at
the
sight
of
mary
grant
s
despair
at
being
separated
from
her
brother
glenarvan
pondered
over
the
terrible
request
of
lady
helena
who
preferred
dying
by
his
hand
to
submitting
to
torture
and
slavery
how
was
he
to
summon
the
terrible
courage
and
mary
who
has
a
right
to
strike
her
dead
thought
john
whose
heart
was
broken
escape
was
clearly
impossible
ten
warriors
armed
to
the
teeth
kept
watch
at
the
door
of
the
morning
of
february
arrived
no
communication
had
taken
place
between
the
natives
and
the
tabooed
prisoners
a
limited
supply
of
provisions
was
in
the
house
which
the
unhappy
inmates
scarcely
touched
misery
deadened
the
pangs
of
hunger
the
day
passed
without
change
and
without
hope
the
funeral
ceremonies
of
the
dead
chief
would
doubtless
be
the
signal
for
their
execution
although
glenarvan
did
not
conceal
from
himself
the
probability
that
had
given
up
all
idea
of
exchange
the
major
still
cherished
a
spark
of
hope
who
knows
said
he
as
he
reminded
glenarvan
of
the
effect
produced
on
the
chief
by
the
death
of
who
knows
but
that
in
his
heart
is
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
even
mcnabbs
remarks
failed
to
awaken
hope
in
glenarvan
s
mind
the
next
day
passed
without
any
appearance
of
preparation
for
their
punishment
and
this
was
the
reason
of
the
delay
the
maories
believe
that
for
three
days
after
death
the
soul
inhabits
the
body
and
therefore
for
three
times
hours
the
corpse
remains
unburied
this
custom
was
rigorously
observed
till
february
the
pah
was
deserted
john
mangles
hoisted
on
wilson
s
shoulders
frequently
reconnoitered
the
outer
defences
not
a
single
native
was
visible
only
the
watchful
sentinels
relieving
guard
at
the
door
of
the
but
on
the
third
day
the
huts
opened
all
the
savages
men
women
and
children
in
all
several
hundred
maories
assembled
in
the
pah
silent
and
calm
came
out
of
his
house
and
surrounded
by
the
principal
chiefs
of
his
tribe
he
took
his
stand
on
a
mound
some
feet
above
the
level
in
the
center
of
the
enclosure
the
crowd
of
natives
formed
in
a
half
circle
some
distance
off
in
dead
silence
at
a
sign
from
a
warrior
bent
his
steps
toward
remember
said
lady
helena
to
her
husband
glenarvan
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
mary
grant
went
closer
to
john
mangles
and
said
hurriedly
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
can
not
but
think
if
a
wife
may
claim
death
at
her
husband
s
hands
to
escape
a
shameful
life
a
betrothed
wife
may
claim
death
at
the
hands
of
her
betrothed
husband
to
escape
the
same
fate
john
at
this
last
moment
i
ask
you
have
we
not
long
been
betrothed
to
each
other
in
our
secret
hearts
may
i
rely
on
you
as
lady
helena
relies
on
lord
glenarvan
mary
cried
the
young
captain
in
his
despair
ah
dear
mary
the
mat
was
lifted
and
the
captives
led
to
the
two
women
were
resigned
to
their
fate
the
men
dissembled
their
sufferings
with
superhuman
effort
they
arrived
in
the
presence
of
the
maori
chief
you
killed
said
he
to
glenarvan
i
did
answered
glenarvan
you
die
at
alone
asked
glenarvan
with
a
beating
heart
oh
if
our
tohonga
s
life
was
not
more
precious
than
yours
exclaimed
with
a
ferocious
expression
of
regret
at
this
moment
there
was
a
commotion
among
the
natives
glenarvan
looked
quickly
around
the
crowd
made
way
and
a
warrior
appeared
heated
by
running
and
sinking
with
fatigue
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
said
in
english
evidently
for
the
benefit
of
the
captives
you
come
from
the
camp
of
the
pakekas
yes
answered
the
maori
you
have
seen
the
prisoner
our
tohonga
i
have
seen
alive
dead
english
have
shot
it
was
all
over
with
glenarvan
and
his
companions
all
cried
you
all
die
at
punishment
fell
on
all
indiscriminately
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
were
grateful
to
heaven
for
the
boon
the
captives
were
not
taken
back
to
they
were
destined
to
attend
the
obsequies
of
the
chief
and
the
bloody
rites
that
accompanied
them
a
guard
of
natives
conducted
them
to
the
foot
of
an
immense
kauri
and
then
stood
on
guard
without
taking
their
eyes
off
the
prisoners
the
three
prescribed
days
had
elapsed
since
the
death
of
and
the
soul
of
the
dead
warrior
had
finally
departed
so
the
ceremonies
commenced
the
body
was
laid
on
a
small
mound
in
the
central
enclosure
it
was
clothed
in
a
rich
dress
and
wrapped
in
a
magnificent
flax
mat
his
head
adorned
with
feathers
was
encircled
with
a
crown
of
green
leaves
his
face
arms
and
chest
had
been
rubbed
with
oil
and
did
not
show
any
sign
of
decay
the
parents
and
friends
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mound
and
at
a
certain
moment
as
if
the
leader
of
an
orchestra
were
leading
a
funeral
chant
there
arose
a
great
wail
of
tears
sighs
and
sobs
they
lamented
the
deceased
with
a
plaintive
rhythm
and
doleful
cadence
the
kinsmen
beat
their
heads
the
kinswomen
tore
their
faces
with
their
nails
and
lavished
more
blood
than
tears
but
these
demonstrations
were
not
sufficient
to
propitiate
the
soul
of
the
deceased
whose
wrath
might
strike
the
survivors
of
his
tribe
and
his
warriors
as
they
could
not
recall
him
to
life
were
anxious
that
he
should
have
nothing
to
wish
for
in
the
other
world
the
wife
of
was
not
to
be
parted
from
him
indeed
she
would
have
refused
to
survive
him
it
was
a
custom
as
well
as
a
duty
and
maori
history
has
no
lack
of
such
sacrifices
this
woman
came
on
the
scene
she
was
still
young
her
disheveled
hair
flowed
over
her
shoulders
her
sobs
and
cries
filled
the
air
incoherent
words
regrets
sobs
broken
phrases
in
which
she
extolled
the
virtues
of
the
dead
alternated
with
her
moans
and
in
a
crowning
paroxysm
of
sorrow
she
threw
herself
at
the
foot
of
the
mound
and
beat
her
head
on
the
earth
the
drew
near
suddenly
the
wretched
victim
rose
but
a
violent
blow
from
a
mere
a
kind
of
club
brandished
by
the
chief
struck
her
to
the
ground
she
fell
senseless
horrible
yells
followed
a
hundred
arms
threatened
the
captives
but
no
one
moved
for
the
funeral
ceremonies
were
not
yet
over
the
wife
of
had
joined
her
husband
the
two
bodies
lay
stretched
side
by
side
but
in
the
future
life
even
the
presence
of
his
faithful
companion
was
not
enough
who
would
attend
on
them
in
the
realm
of
if
their
slaves
did
not
follow
them
into
the
other
world
six
unfortunate
fellows
were
brought
to
the
mound
they
were
attendants
whom
the
pitiless
usages
of
war
had
reduced
to
slavery
during
the
chief
s
lifetime
they
had
borne
the
severest
privations
and
been
subjected
to
all
kinds
of
they
had
been
scantily
fed
and
incessantly
occupied
like
beasts
of
burden
and
now
according
to
maori
ideas
they
were
to
resume
to
all
eternity
this
life
of
bondage
these
poor
creatures
appeared
quite
resigned
to
their
destiny
they
were
not
taken
by
surprise
their
unbound
hands
showed
that
they
met
their
fate
without
resistance
their
death
was
speedy
and
not
aggravated
by
tedious
suffering
torture
was
reserved
for
the
authors
of
the
murder
who
only
twenty
paces
off
averted
their
eyes
from
the
horrible
scene
which
was
to
grow
yet
more
horrible
six
blows
of
the
mere
delivered
by
the
hands
of
six
powerful
warriors
felled
the
victims
in
the
midst
of
a
sea
of
blood
this
was
the
signal
for
a
fearful
scene
of
cannibalism
the
bodies
of
slaves
are
not
protected
by
taboo
like
those
of
their
masters
they
belong
to
the
tribe
they
were
a
sort
of
small
change
thrown
among
the
mourners
and
the
moment
the
sacrifice
was
over
the
whole
crowd
chiefs
warriors
old
men
women
children
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
fell
upon
the
senseless
remains
with
brutal
appetite
faster
than
a
rapid
pen
could
describe
it
the
bodies
still
reeking
were
dismembered
divided
cut
up
not
into
morsels
but
into
crumbs
of
the
two
hundred
maories
present
everyone
obtained
a
share
they
fought
they
struggled
they
quarreled
over
the
smallest
fragment
the
drops
of
hot
blood
splashed
over
these
festive
monsters
and
the
whole
of
this
detestable
crew
groveled
under
a
rain
of
blood
it
was
like
the
delirious
fury
of
tigers
fighting
over
their
prey
or
like
a
circus
where
the
wild
beasts
devour
the
deer
this
scene
ended
a
score
of
fires
were
lit
at
various
points
of
the
pah
the
smell
of
charred
flesh
polluted
the
air
and
but
for
the
fearful
tumult
of
the
festival
but
for
the
cries
that
emanated
from
these
throats
the
captives
might
have
heard
the
bones
crunching
under
the
teeth
of
the
cannibals
glenarvan
and
his
companions
breathless
with
horror
tried
to
conceal
this
fearful
scene
from
the
eyes
of
the
two
poor
ladies
they
understood
then
what
fate
awaited
them
next
day
at
dawn
and
also
with
what
cruel
torture
this
death
would
be
preceded
they
were
dumb
with
horror
the
funeral
dances
commenced
strong
liquors
distilled
from
the
piper
excelsum
animated
the
intoxication
of
the
natives
they
had
nothing
human
left
it
seemed
possible
that
the
taboo
might
be
forgotten
and
they
might
rush
upon
the
prisoners
who
were
already
terrified
at
their
delirious
gestures
but
had
kept
his
own
senses
amidst
the
general
delirium
he
allowed
an
hour
for
this
orgy
of
blood
to
attain
its
maximum
and
then
cease
and
the
final
scene
of
the
obsequies
was
performed
with
the
accustomed
ceremonial
the
corpses
of
and
his
wife
were
raised
the
limbs
were
bent
and
laid
against
the
stomach
according
to
the
maori
usage
then
came
the
funeral
not
the
final
interment
but
a
burial
until
the
moment
when
the
earth
had
destroyed
the
flesh
and
nothing
remained
but
the
skeleton
the
place
of
oudoupa
or
the
tomb
had
been
chosen
outside
the
fortress
about
two
miles
off
at
the
top
of
a
low
hill
called
maunganamu
situated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
lake
and
to
this
spot
the
body
was
to
be
taken
two
palanquins
of
a
very
primitive
kind
in
fact
were
brought
to
the
foot
of
the
mound
and
the
corpses
doubled
up
so
that
they
were
sitting
rather
than
lying
and
their
garments
kept
in
place
by
a
band
of
hanes
were
placed
on
them
four
warriors
took
up
the
litters
on
their
shoulders
and
the
whole
tribe
repeating
their
funeral
chant
followed
in
procession
to
the
place
of
sepulture
the
captives
still
strictly
guarded
saw
the
funeral
cortege
leave
the
inner
inclosure
of
the
pah
then
the
chants
and
cries
grew
fainter
for
about
half
an
hour
the
funeral
procession
remained
out
of
sight
in
the
hollow
valley
and
then
came
in
sight
again
winding
up
the
mountain
side
the
distance
gave
a
fantastic
effect
to
the
undulating
movement
of
this
long
serpentine
column
the
tribe
stopped
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
on
the
summit
of
maunganamu
where
the
burial
place
of
had
been
prepared
an
ordinary
maori
would
have
had
nothing
but
a
hole
and
a
heap
of
earth
but
a
powerful
and
formidable
chief
destined
to
speedy
deification
was
honored
with
a
tomb
worthy
of
his
exploits
the
oudoupa
had
been
fenced
round
and
posts
surmounted
with
faces
painted
in
red
ochre
stood
near
the
grave
where
the
bodies
were
to
lie
the
relatives
had
not
forgotten
that
the
waidoua
the
spirit
of
the
dead
lives
on
mortal
food
as
the
body
did
in
this
life
therefore
food
was
deposited
in
the
inclosure
as
well
as
the
arms
and
clothing
of
the
deceased
nothing
was
omitted
for
comfort
the
husband
and
wife
were
laid
side
by
side
then
covered
with
earth
and
grass
after
another
series
of
laments
then
the
procession
wound
slowly
down
the
mountain
and
henceforth
none
dare
ascend
the
slope
of
maunganamu
on
pain
of
death
for
it
was
tabooed
like
tongariro
where
lie
the
ashes
of
a
chief
killed
by
an
earthquake
in
chapter
xii
strangely
liberated
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
beyond
lake
taupo
behind
the
peaks
of
tuhahua
and
pukepapu
the
captives
were
conducted
back
to
their
prison
they
were
not
to
leave
it
again
till
the
tops
of
the
wahiti
ranges
were
lit
with
the
first
fires
of
day
they
had
one
night
in
which
to
prepare
for
death
overcome
as
they
were
with
horror
and
fatigue
they
took
their
last
meal
together
we
shall
need
all
our
strength
glenarvan
had
said
to
look
death
in
the
face
we
must
show
these
savages
how
europeans
can
the
meal
ended
lady
helena
repeated
the
evening
prayer
aloud
her
companions
repeated
it
after
her
who
does
not
turn
his
thoughts
toward
god
in
the
hour
of
death
this
done
the
prisoners
embraced
each
other
mary
grant
and
helena
in
a
corner
of
the
hut
lay
down
on
a
mat
sleep
which
keeps
all
sorrow
in
abeyance
soon
weighed
down
their
eyelids
they
slept
in
each
other
s
arms
overcome
by
exhaustion
and
prolonged
watching
then
glenarvan
taking
his
friends
aside
said
my
dear
friends
our
lives
and
the
lives
of
these
poor
women
are
in
god
s
hands
if
it
is
decreed
that
we
die
let
us
die
bravely
like
christian
men
ready
to
appear
without
terror
before
the
supreme
judge
god
who
reads
our
hearts
knows
that
we
had
a
noble
end
in
view
if
death
awaits
us
instead
of
success
it
is
by
his
will
stern
as
the
decree
may
seem
i
will
not
repine
but
death
here
means
not
death
only
it
means
torture
insult
perhaps
and
here
are
two
ladies
glenarvan
s
voice
firm
till
now
faltered
he
was
silent
a
moment
and
having
overcome
his
emotion
he
said
addressing
the
young
captain
john
you
have
promised
mary
what
i
promised
lady
helena
what
is
your
plan
i
believe
said
john
that
in
the
sight
of
god
i
have
a
right
to
fulfill
that
yes
john
but
we
are
no
replied
john
showing
him
a
dagger
i
snatched
it
from
when
he
fell
at
your
feet
my
lord
whichever
of
us
survives
the
other
will
fulfill
the
wish
of
lady
helena
and
mary
after
these
words
were
said
a
profound
silence
ensued
at
last
the
major
said
my
friends
keep
that
to
the
last
moment
i
am
not
an
advocate
of
irremediable
i
did
not
speak
for
ourselves
said
glenarvan
be
it
as
it
may
we
can
face
death
had
we
been
alone
i
should
ere
now
have
cried
my
friends
let
us
make
an
effort
let
us
attack
these
wretches
but
with
these
poor
girls
at
this
moment
john
raised
the
mat
and
counted
natives
keeping
guard
on
the
a
great
fire
had
been
lighted
and
its
lurid
glow
threw
into
strong
relief
the
irregular
outlines
of
the
some
of
the
savages
were
sitting
round
the
brazier
the
others
standing
motionless
their
black
outlines
relieved
against
the
clear
background
of
flame
but
they
all
kept
watchful
guard
on
the
hut
confided
to
their
care
it
has
been
said
that
between
a
vigilant
jailer
and
a
prisoner
who
wishes
to
escape
the
chances
are
in
favor
of
the
prisoner
the
fact
is
the
interest
of
the
one
is
keener
than
that
of
the
other
the
jailer
may
forget
that
he
is
on
guard
the
prisoner
never
forgets
that
he
is
guarded
the
captive
thinks
oftener
of
escaping
than
the
jailer
of
preventing
his
flight
and
hence
we
hear
of
frequent
and
wonderful
escapes
but
in
the
present
instance
hatred
and
revenge
were
the
jailers
not
an
indifferent
warder
the
prisoners
were
not
bound
but
it
was
because
bonds
were
useless
when
men
were
watching
the
only
egress
from
the
this
house
with
its
back
to
the
rock
which
closed
the
fortress
was
only
accessible
by
a
long
narrow
promontory
which
joined
it
in
front
to
the
plateau
on
which
the
pah
was
erected
on
its
two
other
sides
rose
pointed
rocks
which
jutted
out
over
an
abyss
a
hundred
feet
deep
on
that
side
descent
was
impossible
and
had
it
been
possible
the
bottom
was
shut
in
by
the
enormous
rock
the
only
outlet
was
the
regular
door
of
the
and
the
maories
guarded
the
promontory
which
united
it
to
the
pah
like
a
drawbridge
all
escape
was
thus
hopeless
and
glenarvan
having
tried
the
walls
for
the
twentieth
time
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
so
the
hours
of
this
night
wretched
as
they
were
slipped
away
thick
darkness
had
settled
on
the
mountain
neither
moon
nor
stars
pierced
the
gloom
some
gusts
of
wind
whistled
by
the
sides
of
the
pah
and
the
posts
of
the
house
creaked
the
fire
outside
revived
with
the
puffs
of
wind
and
the
flames
sent
fitful
gleams
into
the
interior
of
the
group
of
prisoners
was
lit
up
for
a
moment
they
were
absorbed
in
their
last
thoughts
and
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
in
the
hut
it
might
have
been
about
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
the
major
s
attention
was
called
to
a
slight
noise
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
foundation
of
the
posts
in
the
wall
of
the
hut
which
abutted
on
the
rock
mcnabbs
was
at
first
indifferent
but
finding
the
noise
continue
he
listened
then
his
curiosity
was
aroused
and
he
put
his
ear
to
the
ground
it
sounded
as
if
someone
was
scraping
or
hollowing
out
the
ground
outside
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
of
it
he
crept
over
to
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
and
startling
them
from
their
melancholy
thoughts
led
them
to
the
end
of
the
hut
listen
said
he
motioning
them
to
stoop
the
scratching
became
more
and
more
audible
they
could
hear
the
little
stones
grate
on
a
hard
body
and
roll
away
some
animal
in
his
burrow
said
john
mangles
glenarvan
struck
his
forehead
who
knows
said
he
it
might
be
a
animal
or
man
answered
the
major
i
will
soon
find
out
wilson
and
olbinett
joined
their
companions
and
all
united
to
dig
through
the
wall
john
with
his
dagger
the
others
with
stones
taken
from
the
ground
or
with
their
nails
while
mulrady
stretched
along
the
ground
watched
the
native
guard
through
a
crevice
of
the
matting
these
savages
sitting
motionless
around
the
fire
suspected
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
twenty
feet
off
the
soil
was
light
and
friable
and
below
lay
a
bed
of
silicious
tufa
therefore
even
without
tools
the
aperture
deepened
quickly
it
soon
became
evident
that
a
man
or
men
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
pah
were
cutting
a
passage
into
its
exterior
wall
what
could
be
the
object
did
they
know
of
the
existence
of
the
prisoners
or
was
it
some
private
enterprise
that
led
to
the
undertaking
the
prisoners
redoubled
their
efforts
their
fingers
bled
but
still
they
worked
on
after
half
an
hour
they
had
gone
three
feet
deep
they
perceived
by
the
increased
sharpness
of
the
sounds
that
only
a
thin
layer
of
earth
prevented
immediate
communication
some
minutes
more
passed
and
the
major
withdrew
his
hand
from
the
stroke
of
a
sharp
blade
he
suppressed
a
cry
john
mangles
inserting
the
blade
of
his
poniard
avoided
the
knife
which
now
protruded
above
the
soil
but
seized
the
hand
that
wielded
it
it
was
the
hand
of
a
woman
or
child
a
european
on
neither
side
had
a
word
been
uttered
it
was
evidently
the
cue
of
both
sides
to
be
silent
is
it
robert
whispered
glenarvan
but
softly
as
the
name
was
breathed
mary
grant
already
awakened
by
the
sounds
in
the
hut
slipped
over
toward
glenarvan
and
seizing
the
hand
all
stained
with
earth
she
covered
it
with
kisses
my
darling
robert
said
she
never
doubting
it
is
you
it
is
you
yes
little
sister
said
he
it
is
i
am
here
to
save
you
all
but
be
very
brave
lad
repeated
glenarvan
watch
the
savages
outside
said
robert
mulrady
whose
attention
was
distracted
for
a
moment
by
the
appearance
of
the
boy
resumed
his
post
it
is
all
right
said
he
there
are
only
four
awake
the
rest
are
a
minute
after
the
hole
was
enlarged
and
robert
passed
from
the
arms
of
his
sister
to
those
of
lady
helena
round
his
body
was
rolled
a
long
coil
of
flax
rope
my
child
my
child
murmured
lady
helena
the
savages
did
not
kill
you
no
madam
said
he
i
do
not
know
how
it
happened
but
in
the
scuffle
i
got
away
i
jumped
the
barrier
for
two
days
i
hid
in
the
bushes
to
try
and
see
you
while
the
tribe
were
busy
with
the
chief
s
funeral
i
came
and
reconnoitered
this
side
of
the
path
and
i
saw
that
i
could
get
to
you
i
stole
this
knife
and
rope
out
of
the
desert
hut
the
tufts
of
bush
and
the
branches
made
me
a
ladder
and
i
found
a
kind
of
grotto
already
hollowed
out
in
the
rock
under
this
hut
i
had
only
to
bore
some
feet
in
soft
earth
and
here
i
twenty
noiseless
kisses
were
his
reward
let
us
be
off
said
he
in
a
decided
tone
is
paganel
below
asked
glenarvan
monsieur
paganel
replied
the
boy
amazed
yes
is
he
waiting
for
us
no
my
lord
but
is
he
not
here
inquired
robert
no
robert
answered
mary
grant
why
have
you
not
seen
him
asked
glenarvan
did
you
lose
each
other
in
the
confusion
did
you
not
get
away
together
no
my
lord
said
robert
taken
aback
by
the
disappearance
of
his
friend
paganel
well
lose
no
more
time
said
the
major
wherever
paganel
is
he
can
not
be
in
worse
plight
than
ourselves
let
us
truly
the
moments
were
precious
they
had
to
fly
the
escape
was
not
very
difficult
except
the
twenty
feet
of
perpendicular
fall
outside
the
grotto
after
that
the
slope
was
practicable
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
from
this
point
the
prisoners
could
soon
gain
the
lower
valleys
while
the
maories
if
they
perceived
the
flight
of
the
prisoners
would
have
to
make
a
long
round
to
catch
them
being
unaware
of
the
gallery
between
the
and
the
outer
rock
the
escape
was
commenced
and
every
precaution
was
taken
the
captives
passed
one
by
one
through
the
narrow
passage
into
the
grotto
john
mangles
before
leaving
the
hut
disposed
of
all
the
evidences
of
their
work
and
in
his
turn
slipped
through
the
opening
and
let
down
over
it
the
mats
of
the
house
so
that
the
entrance
to
the
gallery
was
quite
concealed
the
next
thing
was
to
descend
the
vertical
wall
to
the
slope
below
and
this
would
have
been
impracticable
but
that
robert
had
brought
the
flax
rope
which
was
now
unrolled
and
fixed
to
a
projecting
point
of
rock
the
end
hanging
over
john
mangles
before
his
friends
trusted
themselves
to
this
flax
rope
tried
it
he
did
not
think
it
very
strong
and
it
was
of
importance
not
to
risk
themselves
imprudently
as
a
fall
would
be
fatal
this
rope
said
he
will
only
bear
the
weight
of
two
persons
therefore
let
us
go
in
rotation
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
first
when
they
arrive
at
the
bottom
three
pulls
at
the
rope
will
be
a
signal
to
us
to
i
will
go
first
said
robert
i
discovered
a
deep
hollow
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
where
those
who
come
down
can
conceal
themselves
and
wait
for
the
go
my
boy
said
glenarvan
pressing
robert
s
hand
robert
disappeared
through
the
opening
out
of
the
grotto
a
minute
after
the
three
pulls
at
the
cord
informed
them
the
boy
had
alighted
safely
glenarvan
and
lady
helena
immediately
ventured
out
of
the
grotto
the
darkness
was
still
very
great
though
some
grayish
streaks
were
already
visible
on
the
eastern
summits
the
biting
cold
of
the
morning
revived
the
poor
young
lady
she
felt
stronger
and
commenced
her
perilous
descent
glenarvan
first
then
lady
helena
let
themselves
down
along
the
rope
till
they
came
to
the
spot
where
the
perpendicular
wall
met
the
top
of
the
slope
then
glenarvan
going
first
and
supporting
his
wife
began
to
descend
backward
he
felt
for
the
tufts
and
grass
and
shrubs
able
to
afford
a
foothold
tried
them
and
then
placed
lady
helena
s
foot
on
them
some
birds
suddenly
awakened
flew
away
uttering
feeble
cries
and
the
fugitives
trembled
when
a
stone
loosened
from
its
bed
rolled
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
had
reached
down
the
slope
when
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
opening
of
the
grotto
stop
whispered
john
mangles
glenarvan
holding
with
one
hand
to
a
tuft
of
tetragonia
with
the
other
holding
his
wife
waited
with
breathless
anxiety
wilson
had
had
an
alarm
having
heard
some
unusual
noise
outside
the
he
went
back
into
the
hut
and
watched
the
maories
from
behind
the
mat
at
a
sign
from
him
john
stopped
glenarvan
one
of
the
warriors
on
guard
startled
by
an
unusual
sound
rose
and
drew
nearer
to
the
he
stood
still
about
two
paces
from
the
hut
and
listened
with
his
head
bent
forward
he
remained
in
that
attitude
for
a
minute
that
seemed
an
hour
his
ear
intent
his
eye
peering
into
the
darkness
then
shaking
his
head
like
one
who
sees
he
is
mistaken
he
went
back
to
his
companions
took
an
armful
of
dead
wood
and
threw
it
into
the
smouldering
fire
which
immediately
revived
his
face
was
lighted
up
by
the
flame
and
was
free
from
any
look
of
doubt
and
after
having
glanced
to
where
the
first
light
of
dawn
whitened
the
eastern
sky
stretched
himself
near
the
fire
to
warm
his
stiffened
limbs
all
s
well
whispered
wilson
john
signaled
to
glenarvan
to
resume
his
descent
glenarvan
let
himself
gently
down
the
slope
soon
lady
helena
and
he
landed
on
the
narrow
track
where
robert
waited
for
them
the
rope
was
shaken
three
times
and
in
his
turn
john
mangles
preceding
mary
grant
followed
in
the
dangerous
route
he
arrived
safely
he
rejoined
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
in
the
hollow
mentioned
by
robert
five
minutes
after
all
the
fugitives
had
safely
escaped
from
the
left
their
retreat
and
keeping
away
from
the
inhabited
shores
of
the
lakes
they
plunged
by
narrow
paths
into
the
recesses
of
the
mountains
they
walked
quickly
trying
to
avoid
the
points
where
they
might
be
seen
from
the
pah
they
were
quite
silent
and
glided
among
the
bushes
like
shadows
whither
where
chance
led
them
but
at
any
rate
they
were
free
toward
five
o
clock
the
day
began
to
dawn
bluish
clouds
marbled
the
upper
stratum
of
clouds
the
misty
summits
began
to
pierce
the
morning
mists
the
orb
of
day
was
soon
to
appear
and
instead
of
giving
the
signal
for
their
execution
would
on
the
contrary
announce
their
flight
it
was
of
vital
importance
that
before
the
decisive
moment
arrived
they
should
put
themselves
beyond
the
reach
of
the
savages
so
as
to
put
them
off
their
track
but
their
progress
was
slow
for
the
paths
were
steep
lady
glenarvan
climbed
the
slopes
supported
not
to
say
carried
by
glenarvan
and
mary
grant
leaned
on
the
arm
of
john
mangles
robert
radiant
with
joy
triumphant
at
his
success
led
the
march
and
the
two
sailors
brought
up
the
rear
another
half
an
hour
and
the
glorious
sun
would
rise
out
of
the
mists
of
the
horizon
for
half
an
hour
the
fugitives
walked
on
as
chance
led
them
paganel
was
not
there
to
take
the
lead
he
was
now
the
object
of
their
anxiety
and
whose
absence
was
a
black
shadow
between
them
and
their
happiness
but
they
bore
steadily
eastward
as
much
as
possible
and
faced
the
gorgeous
morning
light
soon
they
had
reached
a
height
of
feet
above
lake
taupo
and
the
cold
of
the
morning
increased
by
the
altitude
was
very
keen
dim
outlines
of
hills
and
mountains
rose
behind
one
another
but
glenarvan
only
thought
how
best
to
get
lost
among
them
time
enough
by
and
by
to
see
about
escaping
from
the
labyrinth
at
last
the
sun
appeared
and
sent
his
first
rays
on
their
path
suddenly
a
terrific
yell
from
a
hundred
throats
rent
the
air
it
came
from
the
pah
whose
direction
glenarvan
did
not
know
besides
a
thick
veil
of
fog
which
spread
at
his
feet
prevented
any
distinct
view
of
the
valleys
below
but
the
fugitives
could
not
doubt
that
their
escape
had
been
discovered
and
now
the
question
was
would
they
be
able
to
elude
pursuit
had
they
been
seen
would
not
their
track
betray
them
at
this
moment
the
fog
in
the
valley
lifted
and
enveloped
them
for
a
moment
in
a
damp
mist
and
at
three
hundred
feet
below
they
perceived
the
swarming
mass
of
frantic
natives
while
they
looked
they
were
seen
renewed
howls
broke
forth
mingled
with
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
whole
tribe
after
vainly
trying
to
scale
the
rock
of
rushed
out
of
the
pah
and
hastened
by
the
shortest
paths
in
pursuit
of
the
prisoners
who
were
flying
from
their
vengeance
chapter
xiii
the
sacred
mountain
the
summit
of
the
mountain
was
still
a
hundred
feet
above
them
the
fugitives
were
anxious
to
reach
it
that
they
might
continue
their
flight
on
the
eastern
slope
out
of
the
view
of
their
pursuers
they
hoped
then
to
find
some
practicable
ridge
that
would
allow
of
a
passage
to
the
neighboring
peaks
that
were
thrown
together
in
an
orographic
maze
to
which
poor
paganel
s
genius
would
doubtless
have
found
the
clew
they
hastened
up
the
slope
spurred
on
by
the
loud
cries
that
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
avenging
crowd
had
already
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
courage
my
friends
cried
glenarvan
urging
his
companions
by
voice
and
look
in
less
than
five
minutes
they
were
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
then
they
turned
to
judge
of
their
position
and
decide
on
a
route
that
would
baffle
their
pursuers
from
their
elevated
position
they
could
see
over
lake
taupo
which
stretched
toward
the
west
in
its
setting
of
picturesque
mountains
on
the
north
the
peaks
of
pirongia
on
the
south
the
burning
crater
of
tongariro
but
eastward
nothing
but
the
rocky
barrier
of
peaks
and
ridges
that
formed
the
wahiti
ranges
the
great
chain
whose
unbroken
links
stretch
from
the
east
cape
to
cook
s
straits
they
had
no
alternative
but
to
descend
the
opposite
slope
and
enter
the
narrow
gorges
uncertain
whether
any
outlet
existed
glenarvan
could
not
prolong
the
halt
for
a
moment
wearied
as
they
might
be
they
must
fly
or
be
discovered
let
us
go
down
cried
he
before
our
passage
is
cut
but
just
as
the
ladies
had
risen
with
a
despairing
effort
mcnabbs
stopped
them
and
said
glenarvan
it
is
useless
look
and
then
they
all
perceived
the
inexplicable
change
that
had
taken
place
in
the
movements
of
the
maories
their
pursuit
had
suddenly
stopped
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
had
ceased
by
an
imperious
command
the
natives
had
paused
in
their
career
and
surged
like
the
sea
waves
against
an
opposing
rock
all
the
crowd
thirsting
for
blood
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
yelling
and
gesticulating
brandishing
guns
and
hatchets
but
not
advancing
a
foot
their
dogs
rooted
to
the
spot
like
themselves
barked
with
rage
what
stayed
them
what
occult
power
controlled
these
savages
the
fugitives
looked
without
understanding
fearing
lest
the
charm
that
enchained
s
tribe
should
be
broken
suddenly
john
mangles
uttered
an
exclamation
which
attracted
the
attention
of
his
companions
he
pointed
to
a
little
inclosure
on
the
summit
of
the
cone
the
tomb
of
said
robert
are
you
sure
robert
said
glenarvan
yes
my
lord
it
is
the
tomb
i
recognize
robert
was
right
fifty
feet
above
at
the
extreme
peak
of
the
mountain
freshly
painted
posts
formed
a
small
palisaded
inclosure
and
glenarvan
too
was
convinced
that
it
was
the
chief
s
burial
place
the
chances
of
their
flight
had
led
them
to
the
crest
of
maunganamu
glenarvan
followed
by
the
rest
climbed
to
the
foot
of
the
tomb
a
large
opening
covered
with
mats
led
into
it
glenarvan
was
about
to
invade
the
sanctity
of
the
oudoupa
when
he
reeled
backward
a
savage
said
he
in
the
tomb
inquired
the
major
yes
no
matter
go
glenarvan
the
major
robert
and
john
mangles
entered
there
sat
a
maori
wrapped
in
a
large
flax
mat
the
darkness
of
the
oudoupa
preventing
them
from
distinguishing
his
features
he
was
very
quiet
and
was
eating
his
breakfast
quite
coolly
glenarvan
was
about
to
speak
to
him
when
the
native
forestalled
him
by
saying
gayly
and
in
good
english
sit
down
my
lord
breakfast
is
it
was
paganel
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
they
all
rushed
into
the
oudoupa
and
he
was
cordially
embraced
all
round
paganel
was
found
again
he
was
their
salvation
they
wanted
to
question
him
to
know
how
and
why
he
was
here
on
the
summit
of
maunganamu
but
glenarvan
stopped
this
misplaced
curiosity
the
savages
said
he
the
savages
said
paganel
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
have
a
contempt
for
those
people
come
and
look
at
they
all
followed
paganel
out
of
the
the
maories
were
still
in
the
same
position
round
the
base
of
the
mountain
uttering
fearful
cries
shout
yell
till
your
lungs
are
gone
stupid
wretches
said
paganel
i
dare
you
to
come
here
but
why
said
glenarvan
because
the
chief
is
buried
here
and
the
tomb
protects
us
because
the
mountain
is
tabooed
yes
my
friends
and
that
is
why
i
took
refuge
here
as
the
malefactors
used
to
flee
to
the
sanctuaries
in
the
middle
god
be
praised
said
lady
helena
lifting
her
hands
to
heaven
the
fugitives
were
not
yet
out
of
danger
but
they
had
a
moment
s
respite
which
was
very
welcome
in
their
exhausted
state
glenarvan
was
too
much
overcome
to
speak
and
the
major
nodded
his
head
with
an
air
of
perfect
content
and
now
my
friends
said
paganel
if
these
brutes
think
to
exercise
their
patience
on
us
they
are
mistaken
in
two
days
we
shall
be
out
of
their
by
flight
said
glenarvan
but
how
that
i
do
not
know
answered
paganel
but
we
shall
manage
and
now
everybody
wanted
to
know
about
their
friend
s
adventures
they
were
puzzled
by
the
reserve
of
a
man
generally
so
talkative
on
this
occasion
they
had
to
drag
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
usually
he
was
a
ready
now
he
gave
only
evasive
answers
to
the
questions
of
the
rest
paganel
is
another
man
thought
mcnabbs
his
face
was
really
altered
he
wrapped
himself
closely
in
his
great
flax
mat
and
seemed
to
deprecate
observation
everyone
noticed
his
embarrassment
when
he
was
the
subject
of
conversation
though
nobody
appeared
to
remark
it
when
other
topics
were
under
discussion
paganel
resumed
his
usual
gayety
of
his
adventures
all
that
could
be
extracted
from
him
at
this
time
was
as
follows
after
the
murder
of
paganel
took
advantage
like
robert
of
the
commotion
among
the
natives
and
got
out
of
the
inclosure
but
less
fortunate
than
young
grant
he
walked
straight
into
a
maori
camp
where
he
met
a
tall
chief
evidently
of
higher
rank
than
all
the
warriors
of
his
tribe
the
chief
spoke
excellent
english
and
he
saluted
the
by
rubbing
the
end
of
his
nose
against
the
end
of
the
geographer
s
nose
paganel
wondered
whether
he
was
to
consider
himself
a
prisoner
or
not
but
perceiving
that
he
could
not
stir
without
the
polite
escort
of
the
chief
he
soon
made
up
his
mind
on
that
point
this
chief
hihi
or
sunbeam
was
not
a
bad
fellow
paganel
s
spectacles
and
telescope
seemed
to
give
him
a
great
idea
of
paganel
s
importance
and
he
manifested
great
attachment
to
him
not
only
by
kindness
but
by
a
strong
flax
rope
especially
at
night
this
lasted
for
three
days
to
the
inquiry
whether
he
was
well
treated
he
said
yes
and
no
without
further
answer
he
was
a
prisoner
and
except
that
he
expected
immediate
execution
his
state
seemed
to
him
no
better
than
that
in
which
he
had
left
his
unfortunate
friends
one
night
however
he
managed
to
break
his
rope
and
escape
he
had
seen
from
afar
the
burial
of
the
chief
and
knew
that
he
was
buried
on
the
top
of
maunganamu
and
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
the
mountain
would
be
therefore
tabooed
he
resolved
to
take
refuge
there
being
unwilling
to
leave
the
region
where
his
companions
were
in
durance
he
succeeded
in
his
dangerous
attempt
and
had
arrived
the
previous
night
at
the
tomb
of
and
there
proposed
to
recruit
his
strength
while
he
waited
in
the
hope
that
his
friends
might
by
divine
mercy
find
the
means
of
escape
such
was
paganel
s
story
did
he
designedly
conceal
some
incident
of
his
captivity
more
than
once
his
embarrassment
led
them
to
that
conclusion
but
however
that
might
be
he
was
heartily
congratulated
on
all
sides
and
then
the
present
emergency
came
on
for
serious
discussion
the
natives
dare
not
climb
maunganamu
but
they
of
course
calculated
that
hunger
and
thirst
would
restore
them
their
prey
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
and
patience
is
one
of
the
virtues
of
all
savages
glenarvan
was
fully
alive
to
the
difficulty
but
made
up
his
mind
to
watch
for
an
opportunity
or
make
one
first
of
all
he
made
a
thorough
survey
of
maunganamu
their
present
fortress
not
for
the
purpose
of
defence
but
of
escape
the
major
john
robert
paganel
and
himself
made
an
exact
map
of
the
mountain
they
noted
the
direction
outlet
and
inclination
of
the
paths
the
ridge
a
mile
in
length
which
united
maunganamu
to
the
wahiti
chain
had
a
downward
inclination
its
slope
narrow
and
jagged
though
it
was
appeared
the
only
practicable
route
if
they
made
good
their
escape
at
all
if
they
could
do
this
without
observation
under
cover
of
night
they
might
possibly
reach
the
deep
valleys
of
the
range
and
put
the
maories
off
the
scent
but
there
were
dangers
in
this
route
the
last
part
of
it
was
within
pistol
shot
of
natives
posted
on
the
lower
slopes
already
when
they
ventured
on
the
exposed
part
of
the
crest
they
were
saluted
with
a
hail
of
shot
which
did
not
reach
them
some
gun
wads
carried
by
the
wind
fell
beside
them
they
were
made
of
printed
paper
which
paganel
picked
up
out
of
curiosity
and
with
some
trouble
deciphered
that
is
a
good
idea
my
friends
do
you
know
what
those
creatures
use
for
wads
no
paganel
said
glenarvan
pages
of
the
bible
if
that
is
the
use
they
make
of
the
holy
book
i
pity
the
missionaries
it
will
be
rather
difficult
to
establish
a
maori
and
what
text
of
scripture
did
they
aim
at
us
a
message
from
god
himself
exclaimed
john
mangles
who
was
in
the
act
of
reading
the
scorched
fragment
of
paper
it
bids
us
hope
in
him
added
the
young
captain
firm
in
the
faith
of
his
scotch
convictions
read
it
john
said
glenarvan
and
john
read
what
the
powder
had
left
visible
i
will
deliver
him
for
he
hath
trusted
in
my
friends
said
glenarvan
we
must
carry
these
words
of
hope
to
our
dear
brave
ladies
the
sound
will
bring
comfort
to
their
glenarvan
and
his
companions
hastened
up
the
steep
path
to
the
cone
and
went
toward
the
tomb
as
they
climbed
they
were
astonished
to
perceive
every
few
moments
a
kind
of
vibration
in
the
soil
it
was
not
a
movement
like
earthquake
but
that
peculiar
tremor
that
affects
the
metal
of
a
boiler
under
high
pressure
it
was
clear
the
mountain
was
the
outer
covering
of
a
body
of
vapor
the
product
of
subterranean
fires
this
phenomenon
of
course
excited
no
surprise
in
those
that
had
just
traveled
among
the
hot
springs
of
the
waikato
they
knew
that
the
central
region
of
the
is
essentially
volcanic
it
is
a
sieve
whose
interstices
furnish
a
passage
for
the
earth
s
vapors
in
the
shape
of
boiling
geysers
and
solfataras
paganel
who
had
already
noticed
this
called
the
attention
of
his
friends
to
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
mountain
the
peak
of
maunganamu
was
only
one
of
the
many
cones
which
bristle
on
this
part
of
the
island
it
was
a
volcano
of
the
future
a
slight
mechanical
change
would
produce
a
crater
of
eruption
in
these
slopes
which
consisted
merely
of
whitish
silicious
tufa
that
may
be
said
glenarvan
but
we
are
in
no
more
danger
here
than
standing
by
the
boiler
of
the
duncan
this
solid
crust
is
like
sheet
i
agree
with
you
added
the
major
but
however
good
a
boiler
may
be
it
bursts
at
last
after
too
long
mcnabbs
said
paganel
i
have
no
fancy
for
staying
on
the
cone
when
providence
points
out
a
way
i
will
go
at
i
wish
remarked
john
that
maunganamu
could
carry
us
himself
with
all
the
motive
power
that
he
has
inside
it
is
too
bad
that
millions
of
should
lie
under
our
feet
unavailable
for
our
needs
our
duncan
would
carry
us
to
the
end
of
the
world
with
the
thousandth
part
of
the
recollections
of
the
duncan
evoked
by
john
mangles
turned
glenarvan
s
thoughts
into
their
saddest
channel
for
desperate
as
his
own
case
was
he
often
forgot
it
in
vain
regret
at
the
fate
of
his
crew
his
mind
still
dwelt
on
it
when
he
reached
the
summit
of
maunganamu
and
met
his
companions
in
misfortune
lady
helena
when
she
saw
glenarvan
came
forward
to
meet
him
dear
edward
said
she
you
have
made
up
your
mind
are
we
to
hope
or
fear
hope
my
dear
helena
replied
glenarvan
the
natives
will
never
set
foot
on
the
mountain
and
we
shall
have
time
to
devise
a
plan
of
more
than
that
madam
god
himself
has
encouraged
us
to
and
so
saying
john
mangles
handed
to
lady
helena
the
fragment
of
paper
on
which
was
legible
the
sacred
words
and
these
young
women
whose
trusting
hearts
were
always
open
to
observe
providential
interpositions
read
in
these
words
an
indisputable
sign
of
salvation
and
now
let
us
go
to
the
oudoupa
cried
paganel
in
his
gayest
mood
it
is
our
castle
our
our
study
none
can
meddle
with
us
there
ladies
allow
me
to
do
the
honors
of
this
charming
they
followed
paganel
and
when
the
savages
saw
them
profaning
anew
the
tabooed
burial
place
they
renewed
their
fire
and
their
fearful
yells
the
one
as
loud
as
the
other
but
fortunately
the
balls
fell
short
of
our
friends
though
the
cries
reached
them
lady
helena
mary
grant
and
their
companions
were
quite
relieved
to
find
that
the
maories
were
more
dominated
by
superstition
than
by
anger
and
they
entered
the
monument
it
was
a
palisade
made
of
posts
symbolic
figures
tattooed
on
the
wood
set
forth
the
rank
and
achievements
of
the
deceased
strings
of
amulets
made
of
shells
or
cut
stones
hung
from
one
part
to
another
in
the
interior
the
ground
was
carpeted
with
green
leaves
and
in
the
middle
a
slight
mound
betokened
the
place
of
the
newly
made
grave
there
lay
the
chief
s
weapons
his
guns
loaded
and
capped
his
spear
his
splendid
ax
of
green
jade
with
a
supply
of
powder
and
ball
for
the
happy
hunting
grounds
quite
an
arsenal
said
paganel
of
which
we
shall
make
a
better
use
what
ideas
they
have
fancy
carrying
arms
in
the
other
world
well
said
the
major
but
these
are
english
no
doubt
replied
glenarvan
and
it
is
a
very
unwise
practice
to
give
firearms
to
savages
they
turn
them
against
the
invaders
naturally
enough
but
at
any
rate
they
will
be
very
valuable
to
yes
said
paganel
but
what
is
more
useful
still
is
the
food
and
water
provided
for
things
had
been
handsomely
done
for
the
deceased
chief
the
amount
of
provisions
denoted
their
esteem
for
the
departed
there
was
food
enough
to
sustain
ten
persons
for
fifteen
days
or
the
dead
man
forever
the
vegetable
aliments
consisted
of
edible
ferns
sweet
potatoes
the
convolvulus
batatas
which
was
indigenous
and
the
potato
which
had
been
imported
long
before
by
the
europeans
large
jars
contained
pure
water
and
a
dozen
baskets
artistically
plaited
contained
tablets
of
an
unknown
green
gum
the
fugitives
were
therefore
provided
for
some
days
against
hunger
and
thirst
and
they
needed
no
persuasion
to
begin
their
attack
on
the
deceased
chief
s
stores
glenarvan
brought
out
the
necessary
quantity
and
put
them
into
olbinett
s
hands
the
steward
who
never
could
forget
his
routine
ideas
even
in
the
most
exceptional
circumstances
thought
the
meal
a
slender
one
he
did
not
know
how
to
prepare
the
roots
and
besides
had
no
fire
but
paganel
soon
solved
the
difficulty
by
recommending
him
to
bury
his
fern
roots
and
sweet
potatoes
in
the
soil
the
temperature
of
the
surface
stratum
was
very
high
and
a
thermometer
plunged
into
the
soil
would
have
marked
from
to
degrees
in
fact
olbinett
narrowly
missed
being
scalded
for
just
as
he
had
scooped
a
hole
for
the
roots
a
jet
of
vapor
sprang
up
and
with
a
whistling
sound
rose
six
feet
above
the
ground
the
steward
fell
back
in
terror
shut
off
steam
cried
the
major
running
to
close
the
hole
with
the
loose
drift
while
paganel
pondering
on
the
singular
phenomenon
muttered
to
himself
let
me
see
ha
ha
why
not
are
you
hurt
inquired
mcnabbs
of
olbinett
no
major
said
the
steward
but
i
did
not
expect
that
providence
would
send
you
fire
interrupted
paganel
in
a
jovial
tone
first
the
larder
of
and
then
fire
out
of
the
ground
upon
my
word
this
mountain
is
a
paradise
i
propose
that
we
found
a
colony
and
cultivate
the
soil
and
settle
here
for
life
we
shall
be
the
robinsons
of
maunganamu
we
should
want
for
if
it
is
solid
ground
said
john
mangles
well
it
is
not
a
thing
of
yesterday
said
paganel
it
has
stood
against
the
internal
fire
for
many
a
day
and
will
do
so
till
we
leave
it
at
any
breakfast
is
ready
announced
olbinett
with
as
much
dignity
as
if
he
was
in
malcolm
castle
without
delay
the
fugitives
sat
down
near
the
palisade
and
began
one
of
the
many
meals
with
which
providence
had
supplied
them
in
critical
circumstances
nobody
was
inclined
to
be
fastidious
but
opinions
were
divided
as
regarded
the
edible
fern
some
thought
the
flavor
sweet
and
agreeable
others
pronounced
it
leathery
insipid
and
resembling
the
taste
of
gum
the
sweet
potatoes
cooked
in
the
burning
soil
were
excellent
the
geographer
remarked
that
was
not
badly
off
after
all
and
now
that
their
hunger
was
appeased
it
was
time
to
decide
on
their
plan
of
escape
so
soon
exclaimed
paganel
in
a
piteous
tone
would
you
quit
the
home
of
delight
so
soon
but
monsieur
paganel
interposed
lady
helena
if
this
be
capua
you
dare
not
intend
to
imitate
hannibal
madam
i
dare
not
contradict
you
and
if
discussion
is
the
order
of
the
day
let
it
first
said
glenarvan
i
think
we
ought
to
start
before
we
are
driven
to
it
by
hunger
we
are
revived
now
and
ought
to
take
advantage
of
it
we
will
try
to
reach
the
eastern
valleys
by
crossing
the
cordon
of
natives
under
cover
of
the
excellent
answered
paganel
if
the
maories
allow
us
to
and
if
not
asked
john
mangles
then
we
will
use
our
great
resources
said
paganel
but
have
we
great
resources
inquired
the
major
more
than
we
can
use
replied
paganel
without
any
further
explanation
and
then
they
waited
for
the
night
the
natives
had
not
stirred
their
numbers
seemed
even
greater
perhaps
owing
to
the
influx
of
the
stragglers
of
the
tribe
fires
lighted
at
intervals
formed
a
girdle
of
flame
round
the
base
of
the
mountain
so
that
when
darkness
fell
maunganamu
appeared
to
rise
out
of
a
great
brasier
and
to
hide
its
head
in
the
thick
darkness
five
hundred
feet
below
they
could
hear
the
hum
and
the
cries
of
the
enemy
s
camp
at
nine
o
clock
the
darkness
being
very
intense
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
went
out
to
reconnoiter
before
embarking
the
whole
party
on
this
critical
journey
they
made
the
descent
noiselessly
and
after
about
ten
minutes
arrived
on
the
narrow
ridge
that
crossed
the
native
lines
fifty
feet
above
the
camp
all
went
well
so
far
the
maories
stretched
beside
the
fires
did
not
appear
to
observe
the
two
fugitives
but
in
an
instant
a
double
fusillade
burst
forth
from
both
sides
of
the
ridge
back
exclaimed
glenarvan
those
wretches
have
the
eyes
of
cats
and
the
guns
of
riflemen
and
they
turned
and
once
more
climbed
the
steep
slope
of
the
mountain
and
then
hastened
to
their
friends
who
had
been
alarmed
at
the
firing
glenarvan
s
hat
was
pierced
by
two
balls
and
they
concluded
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
venture
again
on
the
ridge
between
two
lines
of
marksmen
wait
till
said
paganel
and
as
we
can
not
elude
their
vigilance
let
me
try
my
hand
on
the
night
was
cold
but
happily
had
been
furnished
with
his
best
night
gear
and
the
party
wrapped
themselves
each
in
a
warm
flax
mantle
and
protected
by
native
superstition
slept
quietly
inside
the
inclosure
on
the
warm
ground
still
violating
with
the
violence
of
the
internal
ebullition
chapter
xiv
a
bold
stratagem
next
day
february
the
sun
s
first
rays
awoke
the
sleepers
of
the
maunganamu
the
maories
had
long
since
been
astir
coming
and
going
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
without
leaving
their
line
of
observation
furious
clamor
broke
out
when
they
saw
the
europeans
leave
the
sacred
place
they
had
profaned
each
of
the
party
glanced
first
at
the
neighboring
mountains
and
at
the
deep
valleys
still
drowned
in
mist
and
over
lake
taupo
which
the
morning
breeze
ruffled
slightly
and
then
all
clustered
round
paganel
eager
to
hear
his
project
paganel
soon
satisfied
their
curiosity
my
friends
said
he
my
plan
has
one
great
recommendation
if
it
does
not
accomplish
all
that
i
anticipate
we
shall
be
no
worse
off
than
we
are
at
present
but
it
must
it
will
and
what
is
it
asked
mcnabbs
it
is
this
replied
paganel
the
superstition
of
the
natives
has
made
this
mountain
a
refuge
for
us
and
we
must
take
advantage
of
their
superstition
to
escape
if
i
can
persuade
that
we
have
expiated
our
profanation
that
the
wrath
of
the
deity
has
fallen
on
us
in
a
word
that
we
have
died
a
terrible
death
do
you
think
he
will
leave
the
plateau
of
maunganamu
to
return
to
his
village
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
glenarvan
and
what
is
the
horrible
death
you
refer
to
asked
lady
helena
the
death
of
the
sacrilegious
my
friends
replied
paganel
the
avenging
flames
are
under
our
feet
let
us
open
a
way
for
them
what
make
a
volcano
cried
john
mangles
yes
an
impromptu
volcano
whose
fury
we
can
regulate
there
are
plenty
of
vapors
ready
to
hand
and
subterranean
fires
ready
to
issue
forth
we
can
have
an
eruption
ready
to
an
excellent
idea
paganel
well
conceived
said
the
major
you
understand
replied
the
geographer
we
are
to
pretend
to
fall
victims
to
the
flames
of
the
maori
pluto
and
to
disappear
spiritually
into
the
tomb
of
and
stay
there
three
four
even
five
days
if
necessary
that
is
to
say
till
the
savages
are
convinced
that
we
have
perished
and
abandon
their
but
said
miss
grant
suppose
they
wish
to
be
sure
of
our
punishment
and
climb
up
here
to
see
no
my
dear
mary
returned
paganel
they
will
not
do
that
the
mountain
is
tabooed
and
if
it
devoured
its
sacrilegious
intruders
it
would
only
be
more
inviolably
it
is
really
a
very
clever
plan
said
glenarvan
there
is
only
one
chance
against
it
that
is
if
the
savages
prolong
their
watch
at
the
foot
of
maunganamu
we
may
run
short
of
provisions
but
if
we
play
our
game
well
there
is
not
much
fear
of
and
when
shall
we
try
this
last
chance
asked
lady
helena
rejoined
paganel
when
the
darkness
is
the
agreed
said
mcnabbs
paganel
you
are
a
genius
and
i
who
seldom
get
up
an
enthusiasm
i
answer
for
the
success
of
your
plan
oh
those
villains
they
shall
have
a
little
miracle
that
will
put
off
their
conversion
for
another
century
i
hope
the
missionaries
will
forgive
the
project
of
paganel
was
therefore
adopted
and
certainly
with
the
superstitious
ideas
of
the
maories
there
seemed
good
ground
for
hope
but
brilliant
as
the
idea
might
be
the
difficulty
was
in
the
the
volcano
might
devour
the
bold
schemers
who
offered
it
a
crater
could
they
control
and
direct
the
eruption
when
they
had
succeeded
in
letting
loose
its
vapor
and
flames
and
lava
streams
the
entire
cone
might
be
engulfed
it
was
meddling
with
phenomena
of
which
nature
herself
has
the
absolute
monopoly
paganel
had
thought
of
all
this
but
he
intended
to
act
prudently
and
without
pushing
things
to
extremes
an
appearance
would
be
enough
to
dupe
the
maories
and
there
was
no
need
for
the
terrible
realities
of
an
eruption
how
long
that
day
seemed
each
one
of
the
party
inwardly
counted
the
hours
all
was
made
ready
for
flight
the
oudoupa
provisions
were
divided
and
formed
very
portable
packets
some
mats
and
firearms
completed
their
light
equipment
all
of
which
they
took
from
the
tomb
of
the
chief
it
is
needless
to
say
that
their
preparations
were
made
within
the
inclosure
and
that
they
were
unseen
by
the
savages
at
six
o
clock
the
steward
served
up
a
refreshing
meal
where
or
when
they
would
eat
in
the
valleys
of
the
ranges
no
one
could
foretell
so
that
they
had
to
take
in
supplies
for
the
future
the
principal
dish
was
composed
of
half
a
dozen
rats
caught
by
wilson
and
stewed
lady
helena
and
mary
grant
obstinately
refused
to
taste
this
game
which
is
highly
esteemed
by
the
natives
but
the
men
enjoyed
it
like
the
real
maories
the
meat
was
excellent
and
savory
and
the
six
devourers
were
devoured
down
to
the
bones
the
evening
twilight
came
on
the
sun
went
down
in
a
bank
of
clouds
a
few
flashes
of
lightning
glanced
across
the
horizon
and
distant
thunder
pealed
through
the
darkened
sky
paganel
welcomed
the
storm
which
was
a
valuable
aid
to
his
plans
and
completed
his
program
the
savages
are
superstitiously
affected
by
the
great
phenomena
of
nature
the
new
zealanders
think
that
thunder
is
the
angry
voice
of
and
lightning
the
fierce
gleam
of
his
eyes
thus
their
deity
was
coming
personally
to
chastise
the
violators
of
the
taboo
at
eight
o
clock
the
summit
of
the
maunganamu
was
lost
in
portentous
darkness
the
sky
would
supply
a
black
background
for
the
blaze
which
paganel
was
about
to
throw
on
it
the
maories
could
no
longer
see
their
prisoners
and
this
was
the
moment
for
action
speed
was
necessary
glenarvan
paganel
mcnabbs
robert
the
steward
and
the
two
sailors
all
lent
a
hand
the
spot
for
the
crater
was
chosen
thirty
paces
from
s
tomb
it
was
important
to
keep
the
oudoupa
intact
for
if
it
disappeared
the
taboo
of
the
mountain
would
be
nullified
at
the
spot
mentioned
paganel
had
noticed
an
enormous
block
of
stone
round
which
the
vapors
played
with
a
certain
degree
of
intensity
this
block
covered
a
small
natural
crater
hollowed
in
the
cone
and
by
its
own
weight
prevented
the
egress
of
the
subterranean
fire
if
they
could
move
it
from
its
socket
the
vapors
and
the
lava
would
issue
by
the
disencumbered
opening
the
workers
used
as
levers
some
posts
taken
from
the
interior
of
the
oudoupa
and
they
plied
their
tools
vigorously
against
the
rocky
mass
under
their
united
efforts
the
stone
soon
moved
they
made
a
little
trench
so
that
it
might
roll
down
the
inclined
plane
as
they
gradually
raised
it
the
vibrations
under
foot
became
more
distinct
dull
roarings
of
flame
and
the
whistling
sound
of
a
furnace
ran
along
under
the
thin
crust
the
intrepid
veritable
cyclops
handling
earth
s
fires
worked
in
silence
soon
some
fissures
and
jets
of
steam
warned
them
that
their
place
was
growing
dangerous
but
a
crowning
effort
moved
the
mass
which
rolled
down
and
disappeared
immediately
the
thin
crust
gave
way
a
column
of
fire
rushed
to
the
sky
with
loud
detonations
while
streams
of
boiling
water
and
lava
flowed
toward
the
native
camp
and
the
lower
valleys
all
the
cone
trembled
as
if
it
was
about
to
plunge
into
a
fathomless
gulf
glenarvan
and
his
companions
had
barely
time
to
get
out
of
the
way
they
fled
to
the
enclosure
of
the
oudoupa
not
without
having
been
sprinkled
with
water
at
degrees
this
water
at
first
spread
a
smell
like
soup
which
soon
changed
into
a
strong
odor
of
sulphur
then
the
mud
the
lava
the
volcanic
stones
all
spouted
forth
in
a
torrent
streams
of
fire
furrowed
the
sides
of
maunganamu
the
neighboring
mountains
were
lit
up
by
the
glare
the
dark
valleys
were
also
filled
with
dazzling
light
all
the
savages
had
risen
howling
under
the
pain
inflicted
by
the
burning
lava
which
was
bubbling
and
foaming
in
the
midst
of
their
camp
those
whom
the
liquid
fire
had
not
touched
fled
to
the
surrounding
hills
then
turned
and
gazed
in
terror
at
this
fearful
phenomenon
this
volcano
in
which
the
anger
of
their
deity
would
swallow
up
the
profane
intruders
on
the
sacred
mountain
now
and
then
when
the
roar
of
the
eruption
became
less
violent
their
cry
was
heard
taboo
taboo
taboo
an
enormous
quantity
of
vapors
heated
stones
and
lava
was
escaping
by
this
crater
of
maunganamu
it
was
not
a
mere
geyser
like
those
that
girdle
round
mount
hecla
in
iceland
it
was
itself
a
hecla
all
this
volcanic
commotion
was
confined
till
then
in
the
envelope
of
the
cone
because
the
safety
valve
of
tangariro
was
enough
for
its
expansion
but
when
this
new
issue
was
afforded
it
rushed
forth
fiercely
and
by
the
laws
of
equilibrium
the
other
eruptions
in
the
island
must
on
that
night
have
lost
their
usual
intensity
an
hour
after
this
volcano
burst
upon
the
world
broad
streams
of
lava
were
running
down
its
sides
legions
of
rats
came
out
of
their
holes
and
fled
from
the
scene
all
night
long
and
fanned
by
the
tempest
in
the
upper
sky
the
crater
never
ceased
to
pour
forth
its
torrents
with
a
violence
that
alarmed
glenarvan
the
eruption
was
breaking
away
the
edges
of
the
opening
the
prisoners
hidden
behind
the
inclosure
of
stakes
watched
the
fearful
progress
of
the
phenomenon
morning
came
the
fury
of
the
volcano
had
not
slackened
thick
yellowish
fumes
were
mixed
with
the
flames
the
lava
torrents
wound
their
serpentine
course
in
every
direction
glenarvan
watched
with
a
beating
heart
looking
from
all
the
interstices
of
the
palisaded
enclosure
and
observed
the
movements
in
the
native
camp
the
maories
had
fled
to
the
neighboring
ledges
out
of
the
reach
of
the
volcano
some
corpses
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
cone
were
charred
by
the
fire
further
off
toward
the
pah
the
lava
had
reached
a
group
of
twenty
huts
which
were
still
smoking
the
maories
forming
here
and
there
groups
contemplated
the
canopied
summit
of
maunganamu
with
religious
awe
approached
in
the
midst
of
his
warriors
and
glenarvan
recognized
him
the
chief
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
side
untouched
by
the
lava
but
he
did
not
ascend
the
first
ledge
standing
there
with
his
arms
stretched
out
like
an
exerciser
he
made
some
grimaces
whose
meaning
was
obvious
to
the
prisoners
as
paganel
had
foreseen
launched
on
the
avenging
mountain
a
more
rigorous
taboo
soon
after
the
natives
left
their
positions
and
followed
the
winding
paths
that
led
toward
the
pah
they
are
going
exclaimed
glenarvan
they
have
left
their
posts
god
be
praised
our
stratagem
has
succeeded
my
dear
lady
helena
my
brave
friends
we
are
all
dead
and
buried
but
this
evening
when
night
comes
we
shall
rise
and
leave
our
tomb
and
fly
these
barbarous
tribes
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
of
the
joy
that
pervaded
the
oudoupa
hope
had
regained
the
mastery
in
all
hearts
the
intrepid
travelers
forgot
the
past
forgot
the
future
to
enjoy
the
present
delight
and
yet
the
task
before
them
was
not
an
easy
one
to
gain
some
european
outpost
in
the
midst
of
this
unknown
country
but
once
off
their
track
they
thought
themselves
safe
from
all
the
savages
in
new
zealand
a
whole
day
had
to
elapse
before
they
could
make
a
start
and
they
employed
it
in
arranging
a
plan
of
flight
paganel
had
treasured
up
his
map
of
new
zealand
and
on
it
could
trace
out
the
best
roads
after
discussion
the
fugitives
resolved
to
make
for
the
bay
of
plenty
towards
the
east
the
region
was
unknown
but
apparently
desert
the
travelers
who
from
their
past
experience
had
learned
to
make
light
of
physical
difficulties
feared
nothing
but
meeting
maories
at
any
cost
they
wanted
to
avoid
them
and
gain
the
east
coast
where
the
missionaries
had
several
stations
that
part
of
the
country
had
hitherto
escaped
the
horrors
of
war
and
the
natives
were
not
in
the
habit
of
scouring
the
country
as
to
the
distance
that
separated
lake
taupo
from
the
bay
of
plenty
they
calculated
it
about
a
hundred
miles
ten
days
march
at
ten
miles
a
day
could
be
done
not
without
fatigue
but
none
of
the
party
gave
that
a
thought
if
they
could
only
reach
the
mission
stations
they
could
rest
there
while
waiting
for
a
favorable
opportunity
to
get
to
auckland
for
that
was
the
point
they
desired
to
reach
this
question
settled
they
resumed
their
watch
of
the
native
proceedings
and
continued
so
doing
till
evening
fell
not
a
solitary
native
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
when
darkness
set
in
over
the
taupo
valleys
not
a
fire
indicated
the
presence
of
the
maories
at
the
base
the
road
was
free
at
nine
o
clock
the
night
being
unusually
dark
glenarvan
gave
the
order
to
start
his
companions
and
he
armed
and
equipped
at
the
expense
of
began
cautiously
to
descend
the
slopes
of
maunganamu
john
mangles
and
wilson
leading
the
way
eyes
and
ears
on
the
alert
they
stopped
at
the
slightest
sound
they
started
at
every
passing
cloud
they
slid
rather
than
walked
down
the
spur
that
their
figures
might
be
lost
in
the
dark
mass
of
the
mountain
at
two
hundred
feet
below
the
summit
john
mangles
and
his
sailors
reached
the
dangerous
ridge
that
had
been
so
obstinately
defended
by
the
natives
if
by
ill
luck
the
maories
more
cunning
than
the
fugitives
had
only
pretended
to
retreat
if
they
were
not
really
duped
by
the
volcanic
phenomenon
this
was
the
spot
where
their
presence
would
be
betrayed
glenarvan
could
not
but
shudder
in
spite
of
his
confidence
and
in
spite
of
the
jokes
of
paganel
the
fate
of
the
whole
party
would
hang
in
the
balance
for
the
ten
minutes
required
to
pass
along
that
ridge
he
felt
the
beating
of
lady
helena
s
heart
as
she
clung
to
his
arm
he
had
no
thought
of
turning
back
neither
had
john
the
young
captain
followed
closely
by
the
whole
party
and
protected
by
the
intense
darkness
crept
along
the
ridge
stopping
when
some
loose
stone
rolled
to
the
bottom
if
the
savages
were
still
in
the
ambush
below
these
unusual
sounds
might
provoke
from
both
sides
a
dangerous
fusillade
but
speed
was
impossible
in
their
progress
down
this
sloping
crest
when
john
mangles
had
reached
the
lowest
point
he
was
scarcely
feet
from
the
plateau
where
the
natives
were
encamped
the
night
before
and
then
the
ridge
rose
again
pretty
steeply
toward
a
wood
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
all
this
lower
part
was
crossed
without
molestation
and
they
commenced
the
ascent
in
silence
the
clump
of
bush
was
invisible
though
they
knew
it
was
there
and
but
for
the
possibility
of
an
ambush
glenarvan
counted
on
being
safe
when
the
party
arrived
at
that
point
but
he
observed
that
after
this
point
they
were
no
longer
protected
by
the
taboo
the
ascending
ridge
belonged
not
to
maunganamu
but
to
the
mountain
system
of
the
eastern
side
of
lake
taupo
so
that
they
had
not
only
pistol
shots
but
fighting
to
fear
for
ten
minutes
the
little
band
ascended
by
insensible
degrees
toward
the
higher
john
could
not
discern
the
dark
wood
but
he
knew
it
ought
to
be
within
two
hundred
feet
suddenly
he
stopped
almost
retreated
he
fancied
he
heard
something
in
the
darkness
his
stoppage
interrupted
the
march
of
those
behind
he
remained
motionless
long
enough
to
alarm
his
companions
they
waited
with
unspeakable
anxiety
wondering
if
they
were
doomed
to
retrace
their
steps
and
return
to
the
summit
of
maunganamu
but
john
finding
that
the
noise
was
not
repeated
resumed
the
ascent
of
the
narrow
path
of
the
ridge
soon
they
perceived
the
shadowy
outline
of
the
wood
showing
faintly
through
the
darkness
a
few
steps
more
and
they
were
hid
from
sight
in
the
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
chapter
xv
from
peril
to
safety
the
night
favored
their
escape
and
prudence
urged
them
to
lose
no
time
in
getting
away
from
the
fatal
neighborhood
of
lake
taupo
paganel
took
the
post
of
leader
and
his
wonderful
instinct
shone
out
anew
in
this
difficult
mountain
journey
his
nyctalopia
was
a
great
advantage
his
sight
enabling
him
to
distinguish
the
smallest
object
in
the
deepest
gloom
for
three
hours
they
walked
on
without
halting
along
the
slope
of
the
eastern
side
paganel
kept
a
little
to
the
southeast
in
order
to
make
use
of
a
narrow
passage
between
the
kaimanawa
and
the
wahiti
ranges
through
which
the
road
from
hawkes
bay
to
auckland
passes
once
through
that
gorge
his
plan
was
to
keep
off
the
road
and
under
the
shelter
of
the
high
ranges
march
to
the
coast
across
the
inhabited
regions
of
the
province
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
they
had
made
twelve
miles
in
twelve
hours
the
courageous
women
could
not
be
pressed
further
and
besides
the
locality
was
suitable
for
camping
the
fugitives
had
reached
the
pass
that
separates
the
two
chains
paganel
map
in
hand
made
a
loop
toward
the
northeast
and
at
ten
o
clock
the
little
party
reached
a
sort
of
redan
formed
by
a
projecting
rock
the
provisions
were
brought
out
and
justice
was
done
to
their
meal
mary
grant
and
the
major
who
had
not
thought
highly
of
the
edible
fern
till
then
now
ate
of
it
heartily
the
halt
lasted
till
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
then
they
resumed
their
journey
and
in
the
evening
they
stopped
eight
miles
from
the
mountains
and
required
no
persuasion
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
next
day
was
one
of
serious
difficulties
their
route
lay
across
this
wondrous
region
of
volcanic
lakes
geysers
and
solfataras
which
extended
to
the
east
of
the
wahiti
ranges
it
is
a
country
more
pleasant
for
the
eye
to
ramble
over
than
for
the
limbs
every
quarter
of
a
mile
they
had
to
turn
aside
or
go
around
for
some
obstacle
and
thus
incurred
great
fatigue
but
what
a
strange
sight
met
their
eyes
what
infinite
variety
nature
lavishes
on
her
great
panoramas
on
this
vast
extent
of
twenty
miles
square
the
subterranean
forces
had
a
field
for
the
display
of
all
their
varied
effects
salt
springs
of
singular
transparency
peopled
by
myriads
of
insects
sprang
up
from
thickets
of
scrub
they
diffused
a
powerful
odor
of
burnt
powder
and
scattered
on
the
ground
a
white
sediment
like
dazzling
snow
the
limpid
waters
were
nearly
at
boiling
point
while
some
neighboring
springs
spread
out
like
sheets
of
glass
gigantic
grew
beside
them
in
conditions
analogous
to
those
of
the
silurian
vegetation
on
every
side
jets
of
water
rose
like
park
fountains
out
of
a
sea
of
vapor
some
of
them
continuous
others
intermittent
as
if
a
capricious
pluto
controlled
their
movements
they
rose
like
an
amphitheater
on
natural
terraces
their
waters
gradually
flowed
together
under
folds
of
white
smoke
and
corroding
the
edges
of
the
steps
of
this
gigantic
staircase
they
fed
whole
lakes
with
their
boiling
torrents
farther
still
beyond
the
hot
springs
and
tumultuous
geysers
came
the
solfataras
the
ground
looked
as
if
covered
with
large
pustules
these
were
slumbering
craters
full
of
cracks
and
fissures
from
which
rose
various
gases
the
air
was
saturated
with
the
acrid
and
unpleasant
odor
of
sulphurous
acid
the
ground
was
encrusted
with
sulphur
and
crystalline
concretions
all
this
incalculable
wealth
had
been
accumulating
for
centuries
and
if
the
sulphur
beds
of
sicily
should
ever
be
exhausted
it
is
here
in
this
little
known
district
of
new
zealand
that
supplies
must
be
sought
the
fatigue
in
traveling
in
such
a
country
as
this
will
be
best
understood
camping
was
very
difficult
and
the
sportsmen
of
the
party
shot
nothing
worthy
of
olbinett
s
skill
so
that
they
had
generally
to
content
themselves
with
fern
and
sweet
potato
a
poor
diet
which
was
scarcely
sufficient
to
recruit
the
exhausted
strength
of
the
little
party
who
were
all
anxious
to
escape
from
this
barren
region
but
four
days
at
least
must
elapse
before
they
could
hope
to
leave
it
on
february
at
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
from
maunganamu
glenarvan
called
a
halt
and
camped
at
the
foot
of
a
nameless
mountain
marked
on
paganel
s
map
the
wooded
plains
stretched
away
from
sight
and
great
forests
appeared
on
the
horizon
that
day
mcnabbs
and
robert
killed
three
kiwis
which
filled
the
chief
place
on
their
table
not
for
long
however
for
in
a
few
moments
they
were
all
consumed
from
the
beaks
to
the
claws
at
dessert
between
the
potatoes
and
sweet
potatoes
paganel
moved
a
resolution
which
was
carried
with
enthusiasm
he
proposed
to
give
the
name
of
glenarvan
to
this
unnamed
mountain
which
rose
feet
high
and
then
was
lost
in
the
clouds
and
he
printed
carefully
on
his
map
the
name
of
the
scottish
nobleman
it
would
be
idle
to
narrate
all
the
monotonous
and
uninteresting
details
of
the
rest
of
the
journey
only
two
or
three
occurrences
of
any
importance
took
place
on
the
way
from
the
lakes
to
the
pacific
ocean
the
march
was
all
day
long
across
forests
and
plains
john
took
observations
of
the
sun
and
stars
neither
heat
nor
rain
increased
the
discomfort
of
the
journey
but
the
travelers
were
so
reduced
by
the
trials
they
had
undergone
that
they
made
very
slow
progress
and
they
longed
to
arrive
at
the
mission
station
they
still
chatted
but
the
conversation
had
ceased
to
be
general
the
little
party
broke
up
into
groups
attracted
to
each
other
not
by
narrow
sympathies
but
by
a
more
personal
communion
of
ideas
glenarvan
generally
walked
alone
his
mind
seemed
to
recur
to
his
unfortunate
crew
as
he
drew
nearer
to
the
sea
he
apparently
lost
sight
of
the
dangers
which
lay
before
them
on
their
way
to
auckland
in
the
thought
of
his
massacred
men
the
horrible
picture
haunted
him
harry
grant
was
never
spoken
of
they
were
no
longer
in
a
position
to
make
any
effort
on
his
behalf
if
his
name
was
uttered
at
all
it
was
between
his
daughter
and
john
mangles
john
had
never
reminded
mary
of
what
she
had
said
to
him
on
that
last
night
at
he
was
too
wise
to
take
advantage
of
a
word
spoken
in
a
moment
of
despair
when
he
mentioned
captain
grant
john
always
spoke
of
further
search
he
assured
mary
that
lord
glenarvan
would
in
the
enterprise
he
persistently
returned
to
the
fact
that
the
authenticity
of
the
document
was
indisputable
and
that
therefore
harry
grant
was
somewhere
to
be
found
and
that
they
would
find
him
if
they
had
to
try
all
over
the
world
mary
drank
in
his
words
and
she
and
john
united
by
the
same
thought
cherished
the
same
hope
often
lady
helena
joined
in
the
conversation
but
she
did
not
participate
in
their
illusions
though
she
refrained
from
chilling
their
enthusiasm
mcnabbs
robert
wilson
and
mulrady
kept
up
their
hunting
parties
without
going
far
from
the
rest
and
each
one
furnished
his
quota
of
game
paganel
arrayed
in
his
flax
mat
kept
himself
aloof
in
a
silent
and
pensive
mood
and
yet
it
is
only
justice
to
say
in
spite
of
the
general
rule
that
in
the
midst
of
trials
dangers
fatigues
and
privations
the
most
amiable
dispositions
become
ruffled
and
embittered
all
our
travelers
were
united
devoted
ready
to
die
for
one
another
on
the
of
february
their
progress
was
stopped
by
a
river
which
answered
to
the
wakari
on
paganel
s
map
and
was
easily
forded
for
two
days
plains
of
low
scrub
succeeded
each
other
without
interruption
half
the
distance
from
lake
taupo
to
the
coast
had
been
traversed
without
accident
though
not
without
fatigue
then
the
scene
changed
to
immense
and
interminable
forests
which
reminded
them
of
australia
but
here
the
kauri
took
the
place
of
the
eucalyptus
although
their
enthusiasm
had
been
incessantly
called
forth
during
their
four
months
journey
glenarvan
and
his
companions
were
compelled
to
admire
and
wonder
at
those
gigantic
pines
worthy
rivals
of
the
cedars
of
lebanon
and
the
mammoth
trees
of
california
the
kauris
measured
a
hundred
feet
high
before
the
ramification
of
the
branches
they
grew
in
isolated
clumps
and
the
forest
was
not
composed
of
trees
but
of
innumerable
groups
of
trees
which
spread
their
green
canopies
in
the
air
two
hundred
feet
from
the
ground
some
of
these
pines
still
young
about
a
hundred
years
old
resembled
the
red
pine
of
europe
they
had
a
dark
crown
surmounted
by
a
dark
conical
shoot
their
older
brethren
five
or
six
hundred
years
of
age
formed
great
green
pavilions
supported
on
the
inextricable
network
of
their
branches
these
patriarchs
of
the
new
zealand
forest
measured
fifty
yards
in
circumference
and
the
united
arms
of
all
the
travelers
could
not
embrace
the
giant
trunk
for
three
days
the
little
party
made
their
way
under
these
vast
arches
over
a
clayey
soil
which
the
foot
of
man
had
never
trod
they
knew
this
by
the
quantity
of
resinous
gum
that
lay
in
heaps
at
the
foot
of
the
trees
and
which
would
have
lasted
for
native
exportation
many
years
the
sportsmen
found
whole
coveys
of
the
kiwi
which
are
scarce
in
districts
frequented
by
the
maories
the
native
dogs
drive
them
away
to
the
shelter
of
these
inaccessible
forests
they
were
an
abundant
source
of
nourishing
food
to
our
travelers
paganel
also
had
the
good
fortune
to
espy
in
a
thicket
a
pair
of
gigantic
birds
his
instinct
as
a
naturalist
was
awakened
he
called
his
companions
and
in
spite
of
their
fatigue
the
major
robert
and
he
set
off
on
the
track
of
these
animals
his
curiosity
was
excusable
for
he
had
recognized
or
thought
he
had
recognized
these
birds
as
moas
belonging
to
the
species
of
dinornis
which
many
naturalists
class
with
the
extinct
birds
this
if
paganel
was
right
would
confirm
the
opinion
of
hochstetter
and
other
travelers
on
the
present
existence
of
the
wingless
giants
of
new
zealand
these
moas
which
paganel
was
chasing
the
contemporaries
of
the
megatherium
and
the
pterodactyles
must
have
been
eighteen
feet
high
they
were
huge
ostriches
timid
too
for
they
fled
with
extreme
rapidity
but
no
shot
could
stay
their
course
after
a
few
minutes
of
chase
these
moas
disappeared
among
the
tall
trees
and
the
sportsmen
lost
their
powder
and
their
pains
that
evening
march
glenarvan
and
his
companions
emerging
at
last
from
the
immense
camped
at
the
foot
of
mount
ikirangi
whose
summit
rose
five
thousand
five
hundred
feet
into
the
air
at
this
point
they
had
traveled
a
hundred
miles
from
maunganamu
and
the
shore
was
still
thirty
miles
away
john
mangles
had
calculated
on
accomplishing
the
whole
journey
in
ten
days
but
he
did
not
foresee
the
physical
difficulties
of
the
country
on
the
whole
owing
to
the
circuits
the
obstacles
and
the
imperfect
observations
the
journey
had
been
extended
by
fully
and
now
that
they
had
reached
mount
ikirangi
they
were
quite
worn
out
two
long
days
of
walking
were
still
to
be
accomplished
during
which
time
all
their
activity
and
vigilance
would
be
required
for
their
way
was
through
a
district
often
frequented
by
the
natives
the
little
party
conquered
their
weariness
and
set
out
next
morning
at
daybreak
between
mount
ikirangi
which
was
left
to
the
right
and
mount
hardy
whose
summit
rose
on
the
left
to
a
height
of
feet
the
journey
was
very
trying
for
about
ten
miles
the
bush
was
a
tangle
of
a
kind
of
flexible
rope
appropriately
called
that
caught
the
feet
at
every
step
for
two
days
they
had
to
cut
their
way
with
an
ax
through
this
hydra
hunting
became
impossible
and
the
sportsmen
failed
in
their
accustomed
tribute
the
provisions
were
almost
exhausted
and
there
was
no
means
of
renewing
them
their
thirst
was
increasing
by
fatigue
and
there
was
no
water
wherewith
to
quench
it
the
sufferings
of
glenarvan
and
his
party
became
terrible
and
for
the
first
time
their
moral
energy
threatened
to
give
way
they
no
longer
walked
they
dragged
themselves
along
soulless
bodies
animated
only
by
the
instinct
of
which
survives
every
other
feeling
and
in
this
melancholy
plight
they
reached
point
lottin
on
the
shores
of
the
pacific
here
they
saw
several
deserted
huts
the
ruins
of
a
village
lately
destroyed
by
the
war
abandoned
fields
and
everywhere
signs
of
pillage
and
incendiary
fires
they
were
toiling
painfully
along
the
shore
when
they
saw
at
a
distance
of
about
a
mile
a
band
of
natives
who
rushed
toward
them
brandishing
their
weapons
glenarvan
hemmed
in
by
the
sea
could
not
fly
and
summoning
all
his
remaining
strength
he
was
about
to
meet
the
attack
when
john
mangles
cried
a
boat
a
boat
and
there
twenty
paces
off
a
canoe
with
six
oars
lay
on
the
beach
to
launch
it
jump
in
and
fly
from
the
dangerous
shore
was
only
a
minute
s
work
john
mangles
mcnabbs
wilson
and
mulrady
took
the
oars
glenarvan
the
helm
the
two
women
robert
and
olbinett
stretched
themselves
beside
him
in
ten
minutes
the
canoe
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
sea
was
calm
the
fugitives
were
silent
but
john
who
did
not
want
to
get
too
far
from
land
was
about
to
give
the
order
to
go
up
the
coast
when
he
suddenly
stopped
rowing
he
saw
three
canoes
coming
out
from
behind
point
lottin
and
evidently
about
to
give
chase
out
to
sea
out
to
sea
he
exclaimed
better
to
drown
if
we
must
the
canoe
went
fast
under
her
four
rowers
for
half
an
hour
she
kept
her
distance
but
the
poor
exhausted
fellows
grew
weaker
and
the
three
pursuing
boats
began
to
gain
sensibly
on
them
at
this
moment
scarcely
two
miles
lay
between
them
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
the
attack
of
the
natives
who
were
already
preparing
to
fire
their
long
guns
what
was
glenarvan
about
standing
up
in
the
stern
he
was
looking
toward
the
horizon
for
some
chimerical
help
what
did
he
hope
for
what
did
he
wish
had
he
a
presentiment
in
a
moment
his
eyes
gleamed
his
hand
pointed
out
into
the
distance
a
ship
a
ship
he
cried
my
friends
row
row
hard
not
one
of
the
rowers
turned
his
head
not
an
must
be
lost
paganel
alone
rose
and
turned
his
telescope
to
the
point
indicated
yes
said
he
a
ship
a
steamer
they
are
under
full
steam
they
are
coming
to
us
found
now
brave
comrades
the
fugitives
summoned
new
energy
and
for
another
half
hour
keeping
their
distance
they
rowed
with
hasty
strokes
the
steamer
came
nearer
and
nearer
they
made
out
her
two
masts
bare
of
sails
and
the
great
volumes
of
black
smoke
glenarvan
handing
the
tiller
to
robert
seized
paganel
s
glass
and
watched
the
movements
of
the
steamer
john
mangles
and
his
companions
were
lost
in
wonder
when
they
saw
glenarvan
s
features
contract
and
grow
pale
and
the
glass
drop
from
his
hands
one
word
explained
it
the
duncan
exclaimed
glenarvan
the
duncan
and
the
convicts
the
duncan
cried
john
letting
go
his
oar
and
rising
yes
death
on
all
sides
murmured
glenarvan
crushed
by
despair
it
was
indeed
the
yacht
they
could
not
mistake
her
the
yacht
and
her
bandit
crew
the
major
could
scarcely
restrain
himself
from
cursing
their
destiny
the
canoe
was
meantime
standing
still
where
should
they
go
whither
fly
what
choice
was
there
between
the
convicts
and
the
savages
a
shot
was
fired
from
the
nearest
of
the
native
boats
and
the
ball
struck
wilson
s
oar
a
few
strokes
then
carried
the
canoe
nearer
to
the
duncan
the
yacht
was
coming
down
at
full
speed
and
was
not
more
than
half
a
mile
off
john
mangles
between
two
enemies
did
not
know
what
to
advise
whither
to
fly
the
two
poor
ladies
on
their
knees
prayed
in
their
agony
the
savages
kept
up
a
running
fire
and
shots
were
raining
round
the
canoe
when
suddenly
a
loud
report
was
heard
and
a
ball
from
the
yacht
s
cannon
passed
over
their
heads
and
now
the
boat
remained
motionless
between
the
duncan
and
the
native
canoes
john
mangles
frenzied
with
despair
seized
his
ax
he
was
about
to
scuttle
the
boat
and
sink
it
with
his
unfortunate
companions
when
a
cry
from
robert
arrested
his
arm
tom
austin
tom
austin
the
lad
shouted
he
is
on
board
i
see
him
he
knows
us
he
is
waving
his
the
ax
hung
useless
in
john
s
hand
a
second
ball
whistled
over
his
head
and
cut
in
two
the
nearest
of
the
three
native
boats
while
a
loud
hurrah
burst
forth
on
board
the
duncan
the
savages
took
flight
fled
and
regained
the
shore
come
on
tom
come
on
cried
john
mangles
in
a
joyous
voice
and
a
few
minutes
after
the
ten
fugitives
how
they
knew
not
were
all
safe
on
board
the
duncan
chapter
xvi
why
the
duncan
went
to
new
zealand
it
would
be
vain
to
attempt
to
depict
the
feelings
of
glenarvan
and
his
friends
when
the
songs
of
old
scotia
fell
on
their
ears
the
moment
they
set
foot
on
the
deck
of
the
duncan
the
piper
blew
his
bagpipes
and
commenced
the
national
pibroch
of
the
malcolm
clan
while
loud
hurrahs
rent
the
air
glenarvan
and
his
whole
party
even
the
major
himself
were
crying
and
embracing
each
other
they
were
delirious
with
joy
the
geographer
was
absolutely
mad
he
frisked
about
telescope
in
hand
pointing
it
at
the
last
canoe
approaching
the
shore
but
at
the
sight
of
glenarvan
and
his
companions
with
their
clothing
in
rags
and
thin
haggard
faces
bearing
marks
of
horrible
sufferings
the
crew
ceased
their
noisy
demonstrations
these
were
specters
who
had
returned
not
the
bright
adventurous
travelers
who
had
left
the
yacht
three
months
before
so
full
of
hope
chance
and
chance
only
had
brought
them
back
to
the
deck
of
the
yacht
they
never
thought
to
see
again
and
in
what
a
state
of
exhaustion
and
feebleness
but
before
thinking
of
fatigue
or
attending
to
the
imperious
demands
of
hunger
and
thirst
glenarvan
questioned
tom
austin
about
his
being
on
this
coast
why
had
the
duncan
come
to
the
eastern
coast
of
new
zealand
how
was
it
not
in
the
hands
of
ben
joyce
by
what
providential
fatality
had
god
brought
them
in
the
track
of
the
fugitives
why
how
and
for
what
purpose
tom
was
stormed
with
questions
on
all
sides
the
old
sailor
did
not
know
which
to
listen
to
first
and
at
last
resolved
to
hear
nobody
but
glenarvan
and
to
answer
nobody
but
him
but
the
convicts
inquired
glenarvan
what
did
you
do
with
them
the
convicts
replied
tom
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
does
not
in
the
least
understand
what
he
is
being
asked
yes
the
wretches
who
attacked
the
what
yacht
your
honor
s
why
of
course
tom
the
duncan
and
ben
joyce
who
came
on
i
don
t
know
this
ben
joyce
and
have
never
seen
never
seen
him
exclaimed
paganel
stupefied
at
the
old
sailor
s
replies
then
pray
tell
me
tom
how
it
is
that
the
duncan
is
cruising
at
this
moment
on
the
coast
of
new
zealand
but
if
glenarvan
and
his
friends
were
totally
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
bewilderment
of
the
old
sailor
what
was
their
amazement
when
he
replied
in
a
calm
voice
the
duncan
is
cruising
here
by
your
honor
s
by
my
orders
cried
glenarvan
yes
my
lord
i
only
acted
in
obedience
to
the
instructions
sent
in
your
letter
of
january
my
letter
my
letter
exclaimed
glenarvan
the
ten
travelers
pressed
closer
round
tom
austin
devouring
him
with
their
eyes
the
letter
dated
from
snowy
river
had
reached
the
duncan
then
let
us
come
to
explanations
pray
for
it
seems
to
me
i
am
dreaming
you
received
a
letter
tom
yes
a
letter
from
your
at
melbourne
at
melbourne
just
as
our
repairs
were
and
this
letter
it
was
not
written
by
you
but
bore
your
signature
my
just
so
my
letter
was
brought
by
a
convict
called
ben
no
by
a
sailor
called
ayrton
a
quartermaster
on
the
yes
ayrton
or
ben
joyce
one
and
the
same
individual
well
and
what
were
the
contents
of
this
letter
it
contained
orders
to
leave
melbourne
without
delay
and
go
and
cruise
on
the
eastern
coast
of
australia
said
glenarvan
with
such
vehemence
that
the
old
sailor
was
somewhat
disconcerted
of
australia
repeated
tom
opening
his
eyes
no
but
new
australia
tom
australia
they
all
cried
with
one
voice
austin
s
head
began
to
feel
in
a
whirl
glenarvan
spoke
with
such
assurance
that
he
thought
after
all
he
must
have
made
a
mistake
in
reading
the
letter
could
a
faithful
exact
old
servant
like
himself
have
been
guilty
of
such
a
thing
he
turned
red
and
looked
quite
disturbed
never
mind
tom
said
lady
helena
god
so
willed
but
no
madam
pardon
me
replied
old
tom
no
it
is
impossible
i
was
not
mistaken
ayrton
read
the
letter
as
i
did
and
it
was
he
on
the
contrary
who
wished
to
bring
me
to
the
australian
ayrton
cried
glenarvan
yes
ayrton
himself
he
insisted
it
was
a
mistake
that
you
meant
to
order
me
to
twofold
have
you
the
letter
still
tom
asked
the
major
extremely
interested
in
this
mystery
yes
mcnabbs
replied
austin
i
ll
go
and
fetch
he
ran
at
once
to
his
cabin
in
the
forecastle
during
his
momentary
absence
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
all
but
the
major
who
crossed
his
arms
and
said
well
now
paganel
you
must
own
this
would
be
going
a
little
too
what
growled
paganel
looking
like
a
gigantic
note
of
interrogation
with
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
and
his
stooping
back
austin
returned
directly
with
the
letter
written
by
paganel
and
signed
by
glenarvan
will
your
honor
read
it
he
said
handing
it
to
him
glenarvan
took
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
order
to
tom
austin
to
put
out
to
sea
without
delay
and
to
take
the
duncan
by
latitude
degrees
to
the
eastern
coast
of
new
zealand
new
zealand
cried
paganel
leaping
up
and
he
seized
the
letter
from
glenarvan
rubbed
his
eyes
pushed
down
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
read
it
for
himself
new
zealand
he
repeated
in
an
indescribable
tone
letting
the
order
slip
between
his
fingers
that
same
moment
he
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
turning
round
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
major
who
said
in
a
grave
tone
well
my
good
paganel
after
all
it
is
a
lucky
thing
you
did
not
send
the
duncan
to
cochin
china
this
pleasantry
finished
the
poor
geographer
the
crew
burst
out
into
loud
homeric
laughter
paganel
ran
about
like
a
madman
seized
his
head
with
both
hands
and
tore
his
hair
he
neither
knew
what
he
was
doing
nor
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
rushed
down
the
poop
stairs
mechanically
and
paced
the
deck
nodding
to
himself
and
going
straight
before
without
aim
or
object
till
he
reached
the
forecastle
there
his
feet
got
entangled
in
a
coil
of
rope
he
stumbled
and
fell
accidentally
catching
hold
of
a
rope
with
both
hands
in
his
fall
suddenly
a
tremendous
explosion
was
heard
the
forecastle
gun
had
gone
off
riddling
the
quiet
calm
of
the
waves
with
a
volley
of
small
shot
the
unfortunate
paganel
had
caught
hold
of
the
cord
of
the
loaded
gun
the
geographer
was
thrown
down
the
forecastle
ladder
and
disappeared
below
a
cry
of
terror
succeeded
the
surprise
produced
by
the
explosion
everybody
thought
something
terrible
must
have
happened
the
sailors
rushed
between
decks
and
lifted
up
paganel
almost
bent
double
the
geographer
uttered
no
sound
they
carried
his
long
body
onto
the
poop
his
companions
were
in
despair
the
major
who
was
always
the
surgeon
on
great
occasions
began
to
strip
the
unfortunate
that
he
might
dress
his
wounds
but
he
had
scarcely
put
his
hands
on
the
dying
man
when
he
started
up
as
if
touched
by
an
electrical
machine
never
never
he
exclaimed
and
pulling
his
ragged
coat
tightly
round
him
he
began
buttoning
it
up
in
a
strangely
excited
manner
but
paganel
began
the
major
no
i
tell
you
i
must
examine
you
shall
not
you
may
perhaps
have
broken
continued
mcnabbs
yes
continued
paganel
getting
up
on
his
long
legs
but
what
i
have
broken
the
carpenter
can
what
is
it
then
bursts
of
laughter
from
the
crew
greeted
this
speech
paganel
s
friends
were
quite
reassured
about
him
now
they
were
satisfied
that
he
had
come
off
safe
and
sound
from
his
adventure
with
the
forecastle
gun
at
any
rate
thought
the
major
the
geographer
is
wonderfully
but
now
paganel
was
recovered
a
little
he
had
to
reply
to
a
question
he
could
not
escape
now
paganel
said
glenarvan
tell
us
frankly
all
about
it
i
own
that
your
blunder
was
providential
it
is
sure
and
certain
that
but
for
you
the
duncan
would
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
convicts
but
for
you
we
should
have
been
recaptured
by
the
maories
but
for
my
sake
tell
me
by
what
supernatural
aberration
of
mind
you
were
induced
to
write
new
zealand
instead
of
australia
well
upon
my
oath
said
paganel
it
is
but
the
same
instant
his
eyes
fell
on
mary
and
robert
grant
and
he
stopped
short
and
then
went
on
what
would
you
have
me
say
my
dear
glenarvan
i
am
mad
i
am
an
idiot
an
incorrigible
fellow
and
i
shall
live
and
die
the
most
terrible
absent
man
i
can
t
change
my
unless
you
get
flayed
get
flayed
alive
cried
the
geographer
with
a
furious
look
is
that
a
personal
allusion
an
allusion
to
what
asked
mcnabbs
quietly
this
was
all
that
passed
the
mystery
of
the
duncan
s
presence
on
the
coast
was
explained
and
all
that
the
travelers
thought
about
now
was
to
get
back
to
their
comfortable
cabins
and
to
have
breakfast
however
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
stayed
behind
with
tom
austin
after
the
others
had
retired
they
wished
to
put
some
further
questions
to
him
now
then
old
austin
said
glenarvan
tell
me
didn
t
it
strike
you
as
strange
to
be
ordered
to
go
and
cruise
on
the
coast
of
new
zealand
yes
your
honor
replied
tom
i
was
very
much
surprised
but
it
is
not
my
custom
to
discuss
any
orders
i
receive
and
i
obeyed
could
i
do
otherwise
if
some
catastrophe
had
occurred
through
not
carrying
out
your
injunctions
to
the
letter
should
not
i
have
been
to
blame
would
you
have
acted
differently
captain
no
tom
replied
john
mangles
but
what
did
you
think
asked
glenarvan
i
thought
your
honor
that
in
the
interest
of
harry
grant
it
was
necessary
to
go
where
i
was
told
to
go
i
thought
that
in
consequence
of
fresh
arrangements
you
were
to
sail
over
to
new
zealand
and
that
i
was
to
wait
for
you
on
the
east
coast
of
the
island
moreover
on
leaving
melbourne
i
kept
our
destination
a
secret
and
the
crew
only
knew
it
when
we
were
right
out
at
sea
and
the
australian
continent
was
finally
out
of
sight
but
one
circumstance
occurred
which
greatly
perplexed
what
was
it
tom
asked
glenarvan
just
this
that
when
the
quartermaster
of
the
britannia
heard
our
destination
ayrton
cried
glenarvan
then
he
is
on
board
yes
your
ayrton
here
repeated
glenarvan
looking
at
john
mangles
god
has
so
willed
said
the
young
captain
in
an
instant
like
lightning
ayrton
s
conduct
his
treachery
glenarvan
s
wound
mulrady
s
assassination
the
sufferings
of
the
expedition
in
the
marshes
of
the
snowy
river
the
whole
past
life
of
the
miscreant
flashed
before
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
and
now
by
the
strangest
concourse
of
events
the
convict
was
in
their
power
where
is
he
asked
glenarvan
eagerly
in
a
cabin
in
the
forecastle
and
under
why
was
he
imprisoned
because
when
ayrton
heard
the
vessel
was
going
to
new
zealand
he
was
in
a
fury
because
he
tried
to
force
me
to
alter
the
course
of
the
ship
because
he
threatened
me
and
last
of
all
because
he
incited
my
men
to
mutiny
i
saw
clearly
he
was
a
dangerous
individual
and
i
must
take
precautions
against
and
since
then
since
then
he
has
remained
in
his
cabin
without
attempting
to
go
that
s
well
just
at
this
moment
glenarvan
and
john
mangles
were
summoned
to
the
saloon
where
breakfast
which
they
so
sorely
needed
was
awaiting
them
they
seated
themselves
at
the
table
and
spoke
no
more
of
ayrton
but
after
the
meal
was
over
and
the
guests
were
refreshed
and
invigorated
and
they
all
went
upon
deck
glenarvan
acquainted
them
with
the
fact
of
the
quartermaster
s
presence
on
board
and
at
the
same
time
announced
his
intention
of
having
him
brought
before
them
may
i
beg
to
be
excused
from
being
present
at
his
examination
said
lady
helena
i
confess
dear
edward
it
would
be
extremely
painful
for
me
to
see
the
wretched
he
must
be
confronted
with
us
helena
replied
lord
glenarvan
i
beg
you
will
stay
ben
joyce
must
see
all
his
victims
face
to
lady
helena
yielded
to
his
wish
mary
grant
sat
beside
her
near
glenarvan
all
the
others
formed
a
group
round
them
the
whole
party
that
had
been
compromised
so
seriously
by
the
treachery
of
the
convict
the
crew
of
the
yacht
without
understanding
the
gravity
of
the
situation
kept
profound
silence
bring
ayrton
here
said
glenarvan

ayrton
s
obstinacy
ayrton
came
he
crossed
the
deck
with
a
confident
tread
and
mounted
the
steps
to
the
poop
his
eyes
were
gloomy
his
teeth
set
his
fists
clenched
convulsively
his
appearance
betrayed
neither
effrontery
nor
timidity
when
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
lord
glenarvan
he
folded
his
arms
and
awaited
the
questions
calmly
and
silently
ayrton
said
glenarvan
here
we
are
then
you
and
us
on
this
very
duncan
that
you
wished
to
deliver
into
the
hands
of
the
convicts
of
ben
the
lips
of
the
quartermaster
trembled
slightly
and
a
quick
flush
suffused
his
impassive
features
not
the
flush
of
remorse
but
of
shame
at
failure
on
this
yacht
which
he
thought
he
was
to
command
as
master
he
was
a
prisoner
and
his
fate
was
about
to
be
decided
in
a
few
seconds
however
he
made
no
reply
glenarvan
waited
patiently
but
ayrton
persisted
in
keeping
absolute
silence
speak
ayrton
what
have
you
to
say
resumed
glenarvan
ayrton
hesitated
the
wrinkles
in
his
forehead
deepened
and
at
length
he
said
in
calm
voice
i
have
nothing
to
say
my
lord
i
have
been
fool
enough
to
allow
myself
to
be
caught
act
as
you
then
he
turned
his
eyes
away
toward
the
coast
which
lay
on
the
west
and
affected
profound
indifference
to
what
was
passing
around
him
one
would
have
thought
him
a
stranger
to
the
whole
affair
but
glenarvan
was
determined
to
be
patient
powerful
motives
urged
him
to
find
out
certain
details
concerning
the
mysterious
life
of
ayrton
especially
those
which
related
to
harry
grant
and
the
britannia
he
therefore
resumed
his
interrogations
speaking
with
extreme
gentleness
and
firmly
restraining
his
violent
irritation
against
him
i
think
ayrton
he
went
on
that
you
will
not
refuse
to
reply
to
certain
questions
that
i
wish
to
put
to
you
and
first
of
all
ought
i
to
call
you
ayrton
or
ben
joyce
are
you
or
are
you
not
the
quartermaster
of
the
britannia
ayrton
remained
impassive
gazing
at
the
coast
deaf
to
every
question
glenarvan
s
eyes
kindled
as
he
said
again
will
you
tell
me
how
you
left
the
britannia
and
why
you
are
in
australia
the
same
silence
the
same
impassibility
listen
to
me
ayrton
continued
glenarvan
it
is
to
your
interest
to
speak
frankness
is
the
only
resource
left
to
you
and
it
may
stand
you
in
good
stead
for
the
last
time
i
ask
you
will
you
reply
to
my
questions
ayrton
turned
his
head
toward
glenarvan
and
looked
into
his
eyes
my
lord
he
said
it
is
not
for
me
to
answer
justice
may
witness
against
me
but
i
am
not
going
to
witness
against
proof
will
be
easy
said
glenarvan
easy
my
lord
repeated
ayrton
in
a
mocking
tone
your
honor
makes
rather
a
bold
assertion
there
it
seems
to
me
for
my
own
part
i
venture
to
affirm
that
the
best
judge
in
the
temple
would
be
puzzled
what
to
make
of
me
who
will
say
why
i
came
to
australia
when
captain
grant
is
not
here
to
tell
who
will
prove
that
i
am
the
ben
joyce
placarded
by
the
police
when
the
police
have
never
had
me
in
their
hands
and
my
companions
are
at
liberty
who
can
damage
me
except
yourself
by
bringing
forward
a
single
crime
against
me
or
even
a
blameable
action
who
will
affirm
that
i
intended
to
take
possession
of
this
ship
and
deliver
it
into
the
hands
of
the
convicts
no
one
i
tell
you
no
one
you
have
your
suspicions
but
you
need
certainties
to
condemn
a
man
and
certainties
you
have
none
until
there
is
a
proof
to
the
contrary
i
am
ayrton
quartermaster
of
the
ayrton
had
become
animated
while
he
was
speaking
but
soon
relapsed
into
his
former
indifference
he
no
doubt
expected
that
his
reply
would
close
the
examination
but
glenarvan
commenced
again
and
said
ayrton
i
am
not
a
crown
prosecutor
charged
with
your
indictment
that
is
no
business
of
mine
it
is
important
that
our
respective
situations
should
be
clearly
defined
i
am
not
asking
you
anything
that
could
compromise
you
that
is
for
justice
to
do
but
you
know
what
i
am
searching
for
and
a
single
word
may
put
me
on
the
track
i
have
lost
will
you
speak
ayrton
shook
his
head
like
a
man
determined
to
be
silent
will
you
tell
me
where
captain
grant
is
asked
glenarvan
no
my
lord
replied
ayrton
will
you
tell
me
where
the
britannia
was
wrecked
no
neither
the
one
nor
the
ayrton
said
glenarvan
in
almost
beseeching
tones
if
you
know
where
harry
grant
is
will
you
at
least
tell
his
poor
children
who
are
waiting
for
you
to
speak
the
word
ayrton
hesitated
his
features
contracted
and
he
muttered
in
a
low
voice
i
can
not
my
then
he
added
with
vehemence
as
if
reproaching
himself
for
a
momentary
weakness
no
i
will
not
speak
have
me
hanged
if
you
hanged
exclaimed
glenarvan
overcome
by
a
sudden
feeling
of
anger
but
immediately
mastering
himself
he
added
in
a
grave
voice
ayrton
there
is
neither
judge
nor
executioner
here
at
the
first
port
we
touch
at
you
will
be
given
up
into
the
hands
of
the
english
that
is
what
i
demand
was
the
quartermaster
s
reply
then
he
turned
away
and
quietly
walked
back
to
his
cabin
which
served
as
his
prison
two
sailors
kept
guard
at
the
door
with
orders
to
watch
his
slightest
movement
the
witnesses
of
this
examination
retired
from
the
scene
indignant
and
despairing
as
glenarvan
could
make
no
way
against
ayrton
s
obstinacy
what
was
to
be
done
now
plainly
no
course
remained
but
to
carry
out
the
plan
formed
at
eden
of
returning
to
europe
and
giving
up
for
the
time
this
unsuccessful
enterprise
for
the
traces
of
the
britannia
seemed
irrevocably
lost
and
the
document
did
not
appear
to
allow
any
fresh
interpretation
on
the
parallel
there
was
not
even
another
country
and
the
duncan
had
only
to
turn
and
go
back
after
glenarvan
had
consulted
his
friends
he
talked
over
the
question
of
returning
more
particularly
with
the
captain
john
examined
the
coal
bunkers
and
found
there
was
only
enough
to
last
fifteen
days
longer
at
the
outside
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
put
in
at
the
nearest
port
for
a
fresh
supply
john
proposed
that
he
should
steer
for
the
bay
of
talcahuano
where
the
duncan
had
once
before
been
revictualed
before
she
commenced
her
voyage
of
circumnavigation
it
was
a
direct
route
across
and
lay
exactly
along
the
parallel
from
thence
the
yacht
being
amply
provisioned
might
go
south
double
cape
horn
and
get
back
to
scotland
by
the
atlantic
route
this
plan
was
adopted
and
orders
were
given
to
the
engineer
to
get
up
the
steam
half
an
hour
afterward
the
of
the
yacht
was
turned
toward
talcahuano
over
a
sea
worthy
of
being
called
the
pacific
and
at
six
the
last
mountains
of
new
zealand
had
disappeared
in
warm
hazy
mist
on
the
horizon
the
return
voyage
was
fairly
commenced
a
sad
voyage
for
the
courageous
searching
party
to
come
back
to
the
port
without
bringing
home
harry
grant
with
them
the
crew
so
joyous
at
departure
and
so
hopeful
were
coming
back
to
europe
defeated
and
discouraged
there
was
not
one
among
the
brave
fellows
whose
heart
did
not
swell
at
the
thought
of
seeing
his
own
country
once
more
and
yet
there
was
not
one
among
them
either
who
would
not
have
been
willing
to
brave
the
perils
of
the
sea
for
a
long
time
still
if
they
could
but
find
captain
grant
consequently
the
hurrahs
which
greeted
the
return
of
lord
glenarvan
to
the
yacht
soon
gave
place
to
dejection
instead
of
the
close
intercourse
which
had
formerly
existed
among
the
passengers
and
the
lively
conversations
which
had
cheered
the
voyage
each
one
kept
apart
from
the
others
in
the
solitude
of
his
own
cabin
and
it
was
seldom
that
anyone
appeared
on
the
deck
of
the
duncan
paganel
who
generally
shared
in
an
exaggerated
form
the
feelings
of
those
about
him
whether
painful
or
joyous
a
man
who
could
have
invented
hope
if
necessary
even
paganel
was
gloomy
and
taciturn
he
was
seldom
visible
his
natural
loquacity
and
french
vivacity
gave
place
to
silence
and
dejection
he
seemed
even
more
downhearted
than
his
companions
if
glenarvan
spoke
at
all
of
renewing
the
search
he
shook
his
head
like
a
man
who
has
given
up
all
hope
and
whose
convictions
concerning
the
fate
of
the
shipwrecked
men
appeared
settled
it
was
quite
evident
he
believed
them
irrevocably
lost
and
yet
there
was
a
man
on
board
who
could
have
spoken
the
decisive
word
and
refused
to
break
his
silence
this
was
ayrton
there
was
no
doubt
the
fellow
knew
if
not
the
present
whereabouts
of
the
captain
at
least
the
place
of
shipwreck
but
it
was
evident
that
were
grant
found
he
would
be
a
witness
against
him
hence
his
persistent
silence
which
gave
rise
to
great
indignation
on
board
especially
among
the
crew
who
would
have
liked
to
deal
summarily
with
him
glenarvan
repeatedly
renewed
his
attempts
with
the
quartermaster
but
promises
and
threats
were
alike
useless
ayrton
s
obstinacy
was
so
great
and
so
inexplicable
that
the
major
began
to
believe
he
had
nothing
to
reveal
his
opinion
was
shared
moreover
by
the
geographer
as
it
corroborated
his
own
notion
about
harry
grant
but
if
ayrton
knew
nothing
why
did
he
not
confess
his
ignorance
it
could
not
be
turned
against
him
his
silence
increased
the
difficulty
of
forming
any
new
plan
was
the
presence
of
the
quartermaster
on
the
australian
continent
a
proof
of
harry
grant
s
being
there
it
was
settled
that
they
must
get
this
information
out
of
ayrton
lady
helena
seeing
her
husband
s
asked
his
permission
to
try
her
powers
against
the
obstinacy
of
the
quartermaster
when
a
man
had
failed
a
woman
perhaps
with
her
gentler
influence
might
succeed
is
there
not
a
constant
repetition
going
on
of
the
story
of
the
fable
where
the
storm
blow
as
it
will
can
not
tear
the
cloak
from
the
shoulders
of
the
traveler
while
the
first
warm
rays
of
sunshine
make
him
throw
it
off
immediately
glenarvan
knowing
his
young
wife
s
good
sense
allowed
her
to
act
as
she
pleased
the
same
day
the
of
march
ayrton
was
conducted
to
lady
helena
s
saloon
mary
grant
was
to
be
present
at
the
interview
for
the
influence
of
the
young
girl
might
be
considerable
and
lady
helena
would
not
lose
any
chance
of
success
for
a
whole
hour
the
two
ladies
were
closeted
with
the
quartermaster
but
nothing
transpired
about
their
interview
what
had
been
said
what
arguments
they
used
to
win
the
secret
from
the
convict
or
what
questions
were
asked
remained
unknown
but
when
they
left
ayrton
they
did
not
seem
to
have
succeeded
as
the
expression
on
their
faces
denoted
discouragement
in
consequence
of
this
when
the
quartermaster
was
being
taken
back
to
his
cabin
the
sailors
met
him
with
violent
menaces
he
took
no
notice
except
by
shrugging
his
shoulders
which
so
increased
their
rage
that
john
mangles
and
glenarvan
had
to
interfere
and
could
only
repress
it
with
difficulty
but
lady
helena
would
not
own
herself
vanquished
she
resolved
to
struggle
to
the
last
with
this
pitiless
man
and
went
next
day
herself
to
his
cabin
to
avoid
exposing
him
again
to
the
vindictiveness
of
the
crew
the
good
and
gentle
scotchwoman
stayed
alone
with
the
convict
leader
for
two
long
hours
glenarvan
in
a
state
of
extreme
nervous
anxiety
remained
outside
the
cabin
alternately
resolved
to
exhaust
completely
this
last
chance
of
success
alternately
resolved
to
rush
in
and
snatch
his
wife
from
so
painful
a
situation
but
this
time
when
lady
helena
reappeared
her
look
was
full
of
hope
had
she
succeeded
in
extracting
the
secret
and
awakening
in
that
adamant
heart
a
last
faint
touch
of
pity
mcnabbs
who
first
saw
her
could
not
restrain
a
gesture
of
incredulity
however
the
report
soon
spread
among
the
sailors
that
the
quartermaster
had
yielded
to
the
persuasions
of
lady
helena
the
effect
was
electrical
the
entire
crew
assembled
on
deck
far
quicker
than
tom
austin
s
whistle
could
have
brought
them
together
glenarvan
had
hastened
up
to
his
wife
and
eagerly
asked
has
he
spoken
no
replied
lady
helena
but
he
has
yielded
to
my
entreaties
and
wishes
to
see
ah
dear
helena
you
have
succeeded
i
hope
so
have
you
made
him
any
promise
that
i
must
ratify
only
one
that
you
will
do
all
in
your
power
to
mitigate
his
very
well
dear
helena
let
ayrton
come
lady
helena
retired
to
her
cabin
with
mary
grant
and
the
quartermaster
was
brought
into
the
saloon
where
lord
glenarvan
was
expecting
him
chapter
xviii
a
discouraging
confession
as
soon
as
the
quartermaster
was
brought
into
the
presence
of
lord
glenarvan
his
keepers
withdrew
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
ayrton
said
glenarvan
yes
my
lord
replied
the
quartermaster
did
you
wish
for
a
private
interview
yes
but
i
think
if
major
mcnabbs
and
paganel
were
present
it
would
be
for
whom
for
ayrton
spoke
quite
calmly
and
firmly
glenarvan
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
and
then
sent
to
summon
mcnabbs
and
paganel
who
came
at
once
we
are
all
ready
to
listen
to
you
said
glenarvan
when
his
two
friends
had
taken
their
place
at
the
saloon
table
ayrton
collected
himself
for
an
instant
and
then
said
my
lord
it
is
usual
for
witnesses
to
be
present
at
every
contract
or
transaction
between
two
parties
that
is
why
i
desire
the
presence
of
paganel
and
mcnabbs
for
it
is
properly
speaking
a
bargain
which
i
propose
to
glenarvan
accustomed
to
ayrton
s
ways
exhibited
no
surprise
though
any
bargaining
between
this
man
and
himself
seemed
strange
what
is
the
bargain
he
said
this
replied
ayrton
you
wish
to
obtain
from
me
certain
facts
which
may
be
useful
to
you
i
wish
to
obtain
from
you
certain
advantages
which
would
be
valuable
to
me
it
is
giving
for
giving
my
lord
do
you
agree
to
this
or
not
what
are
the
facts
asked
paganel
eagerly
no
said
glenarvan
what
are
the
advantages
ayrton
bowed
in
token
that
he
understood
glenarvan
s
distinction
these
he
said
are
the
advantages
i
ask
it
is
still
your
intention
i
suppose
to
deliver
me
up
to
the
english
authorities
yes
ayrton
it
is
only
i
don
t
say
it
is
not
replied
the
quartermaster
quietly
then
of
course
you
would
never
consent
to
set
me
at
glenarvan
hesitated
before
replying
to
a
question
so
plainly
put
on
the
answer
he
gave
perhaps
the
fate
of
harry
grant
might
depend
however
a
feeling
of
duty
toward
human
justice
compelled
him
to
say
no
ayrton
i
can
not
set
you
at
i
do
not
ask
it
said
the
quartermaster
proudly
then
what
is
it
you
want
a
middle
place
my
lord
between
the
gibbet
that
awaits
me
and
the
liberty
which
you
can
not
grant
and
that
is
to
allow
me
to
be
left
on
one
of
the
uninhabited
islands
of
the
pacific
with
such
things
as
are
absolute
necessaries
i
will
manage
as
best
i
can
and
will
repent
if
i
have
glenarvan
quite
unprepared
for
such
a
proposal
looked
at
his
two
friends
in
silence
but
after
a
brief
reflection
he
replied
ayrton
if
i
agree
to
your
request
you
will
tell
me
all
i
have
an
interest
in
yes
my
lord
that
is
to
say
all
i
know
about
captain
grant
and
the
the
whole
truth
the
but
what
guarantee
have
i
oh
i
see
what
you
are
uneasy
about
you
need
a
guarantee
for
me
for
the
truth
of
a
criminal
that
s
natural
but
what
can
you
have
under
the
circumstances
there
is
no
help
for
it
you
must
either
take
my
offer
or
leave
i
will
trust
to
you
ayrton
said
glenarvan
simply
and
you
do
right
my
lord
besides
if
i
deceive
you
vengeance
is
in
your
own
how
you
can
come
and
take
me
again
from
where
you
left
me
as
i
shall
have
no
means
of
getting
away
from
the
ayrton
had
an
answer
for
everything
he
anticipated
the
difficulties
and
furnished
unanswerable
arguments
against
himself
it
was
evident
he
intended
to
affect
perfect
good
faith
in
the
business
it
was
impossible
to
show
more
complete
confidence
and
yet
he
was
prepared
to
go
still
further
in
disinterestedness
my
lord
and
gentlemen
he
added
i
wish
to
convince
you
of
the
fact
that
i
am
playing
cards
on
the
table
i
have
no
wish
to
deceive
you
and
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
fresh
proof
of
my
sincerity
in
this
matter
i
deal
frankly
with
you
because
i
reckon
on
your
speak
ayrton
said
glenarvan
my
lord
i
have
not
your
promise
yet
to
accede
to
my
proposal
and
yet
i
do
not
scruple
to
tell
you
that
i
know
very
little
about
harry
very
little
exclaimed
glenarvan
yes
my
lord
the
details
i
am
in
a
position
to
give
you
relate
to
myself
they
are
entirely
personal
and
will
not
do
much
to
help
you
to
recover
the
lost
traces
of
captain
keen
disappointment
was
depicted
on
the
faces
of
glenarvan
and
the
major
they
thought
the
quartermaster
in
the
possession
of
an
important
secret
and
he
declared
that
his
communications
would
be
very
nearly
barren
paganel
s
countenance
remained
unmoved
somehow
or
other
this
avowal
of
ayrton
and
surrender
of
himself
so
to
speak
unconditionally
singularly
touched
his
auditors
especially
when
the
quartermaster
added
so
i
tell
you
beforehand
the
bargain
will
be
more
to
my
profit
than
it
does
not
signify
replied
glenarvan
i
accept
your
proposal
ayrton
i
give
you
my
word
to
land
you
on
one
of
the
islands
of
the
pacific
all
right
my
lord
replied
the
quartermaster
was
this
strange
man
glad
of
this
decision
one
might
have
doubted
it
for
his
impassive
countenance
betokened
no
emotion
whatever
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
acting
for
someone
else
rather
than
himself
i
am
ready
to
answer
he
said
we
have
no
questions
to
put
to
you
said
glenarvan
tell
us
all
you
know
ayrton
and
begin
by
declaring
who
you
gentlemen
replied
ayrton
i
am
really
tom
ayrton
the
quartermaster
of
the
britannia
i
left
glasgow
on
harry
grant
s
ship
on
the
of
march
for
fourteen
months
i
cruised
with
him
in
the
pacific
in
search
of
an
advantageous
spot
for
founding
a
scotch
colony
harry
grant
was
the
man
to
carry
out
grand
projects
but
serious
disputes
often
arose
between
us
his
temper
and
mine
could
not
agree
i
can
not
bend
and
with
harry
grant
when
once
his
resolution
is
taken
any
resistance
is
impossible
my
lord
he
has
an
iron
will
both
for
himself
and
others
but
in
spite
of
that
i
dared
to
rebel
and
i
tried
to
get
the
crew
to
join
me
and
to
take
possession
of
the
vessel
whether
i
was
to
blame
or
not
is
of
no
consequence
be
that
as
it
may
harry
grant
had
no
scruples
and
on
the
of
april
he
left
me
behind
on
the
west
coast
of
of
australia
said
the
major
interrupting
ayrton
in
his
narrative
then
of
course
you
had
quitted
the
britannia
before
she
touched
at
callao
which
was
her
last
date
yes
replied
the
quartermaster
for
the
britannia
did
not
touch
there
while
i
was
on
board
and
how
i
came
to
speak
of
callao
at
paddy
o
moore
s
farm
was
that
i
learned
the
circumstances
from
your
go
on
ayrton
said
glenarvan
i
found
myself
abandoned
on
a
nearly
desert
coast
but
only
forty
miles
from
the
penal
settlement
at
perth
the
capital
of
western
australia
as
i
was
wandering
there
along
the
shore
i
met
a
band
of
convicts
who
had
just
escaped
and
i
joined
myself
to
them
you
will
dispense
my
lord
with
any
account
of
my
life
for
two
years
and
a
half
this
much
however
i
must
tell
you
that
i
became
the
leader
of
the
gang
under
the
name
of
ben
joyce
in
september
i
introduced
myself
at
the
irish
farm
where
i
engaged
myself
as
a
servant
in
my
real
name
ayrton
i
waited
there
till
i
should
get
some
chance
of
seizing
a
ship
this
was
my
one
idea
two
months
afterward
the
duncan
arrived
during
your
visit
to
the
farm
you
related
captain
grant
s
history
and
i
learned
then
facts
of
which
i
was
not
previously
aware
that
the
britannia
had
touched
at
callao
and
that
her
latest
news
was
dated
june
two
months
after
my
disembarkation
and
also
about
the
document
and
the
loss
of
the
ship
somewhere
along
the
parallel
and
lastly
the
strong
reasons
you
had
for
supposing
harry
grant
was
on
the
australian
continent
without
the
least
hesitation
i
determined
to
appropriate
the
duncan
a
matchless
vessel
able
to
outdistance
the
swiftest
ships
in
the
british
navy
but
serious
injuries
had
to
be
repaired
i
therefore
let
it
go
to
melbourne
and
joined
myself
to
you
in
my
true
character
as
quartermaster
offering
to
guide
you
to
the
scene
of
the
shipwreck
fictitiously
placed
by
me
on
the
east
coast
of
australia
it
was
in
this
way
followed
or
sometimes
preceded
by
my
gang
of
convicts
i
directed
your
expedition
toward
the
province
of
victoria
my
men
committed
a
bootless
crime
at
camden
bridge
since
the
duncan
if
brought
to
the
coast
could
not
escape
me
and
with
the
yacht
once
mine
i
was
master
of
the
ocean
i
led
you
in
this
way
unsuspectingly
as
far
as
the
snowy
river
the
horses
and
bullocks
dropped
dead
one
by
one
poisoned
by
the
gastrolobium
i
dragged
the
wagon
into
the
marshes
where
it
got
half
buried
at
my
instance
but
you
know
the
rest
my
lord
and
you
may
be
sure
that
but
for
the
blunder
of
paganel
i
should
now
command
the
duncan
such
is
my
history
gentlemen
my
disclosures
unfortunately
can
not
put
you
on
the
track
of
harry
grant
and
you
perceive
that
you
have
made
but
a
poor
bargain
by
coming
to
my
the
quartermaster
said
no
more
but
crossed
his
arms
in
his
usual
fashion
and
waited
glenarvan
and
his
friends
kept
silence
they
felt
that
this
strange
criminal
had
spoken
the
whole
truth
he
had
only
missed
his
coveted
prize
the
duncan
through
a
cause
independent
of
his
will
his
accomplices
had
gone
to
twofold
bay
as
was
proved
by
the
convict
blouse
found
by
glenarvan
faithful
to
the
orders
of
their
chief
they
had
kept
watch
on
the
yacht
and
at
length
weary
of
waiting
had
returned
to
the
old
haunt
of
robbers
and
incendiaries
in
the
country
parts
of
new
south
wales
the
major
put
the
first
question
his
object
being
to
verify
the
dates
of
the
britannia
you
are
sure
then
he
said
that
it
was
on
the
of
april
you
were
left
on
the
west
coast
of
australia
on
that
very
day
replied
ayrton
and
do
you
know
what
projects
harry
grant
had
in
view
at
the
time
in
an
indefinite
way
i
say
all
you
can
ayrton
said
glenarvan
the
least
indication
may
set
us
in
the
right
i
only
know
this
much
my
lord
replied
the
quartermaster
that
captain
grant
intended
to
visit
new
zealand
now
as
this
part
of
the
programme
was
not
carried
out
while
i
was
on
board
it
is
not
impossible
that
on
leaving
callao
the
britannia
went
to
reconnoiter
new
zealand
this
would
agree
with
the
date
assigned
by
the
document
to
the
shipwreck
the
of
june
clearly
said
paganel
but
objected
glenarvan
there
is
nothing
in
the
fragmentary
words
in
the
document
that
could
apply
to
new
that
i
can
not
answer
said
the
quartermaster
well
ayrton
said
glenarvan
you
have
kept
your
word
and
i
will
keep
mine
we
have
to
decide
now
on
what
island
of
the
pacific
ocean
you
are
to
be
left
it
matters
little
my
lord
replied
ayrton
return
to
your
cabin
said
glenarvan
and
wait
our
the
quartermaster
withdrew
guarded
by
the
two
sailors
that
villain
might
have
been
a
man
said
the
major
yes
returned
glenarvan
he
is
a
strong
fellow
why
was
it
that
he
must
needs
turn
his
powers
to
such
evil
account
but
harry
grant
i
must
fear
he
is
irrevocably
lost
poor
children
who
can
tell
them
where
their
father
is
i
can
replied
paganel
yes
i
can
one
could
not
help
remarking
that
the
geographer
so
loquacious
and
impatient
usually
had
scarcely
spoken
during
ayrton
s
examination
he
listened
without
opening
his
mouth
but
this
speech
of
his
now
was
worth
many
others
and
it
made
glenarvan
spring
to
his
feet
crying
out
you
paganel
you
know
where
captain
grant
is
yes
as
far
as
can
be
how
do
you
know
from
that
infernal
ah
said
the
major
in
a
tone
of
the
most
profound
incredulity
hear
me
first
and
shrug
your
shoulders
afterward
said
paganel
i
did
not
speak
sooner
because
you
would
not
have
believed
me
besides
it
was
useless
and
i
only
speak
because
ayrton
s
opinion
just
supports
my
then
it
is
new
zealand
asked
glenarvan
listen
and
judge
replied
paganel
it
is
not
without
reason
or
rather
i
had
a
reason
for
making
the
blunder
which
has
saved
our
lives
when
i
was
in
the
very
act
of
writing
the
letter
to
glenarvan
s
dictation
the
word
zealand
was
swimming
in
my
brain
this
is
why
you
remember
we
were
in
the
wagon
mcnabbs
had
just
apprised
lady
helena
about
the
convicts
he
had
given
her
the
number
of
the
and
new
zealand
which
contained
the
account
of
the
catastrophe
at
camden
bridge
now
just
as
i
was
writing
the
newspaper
was
lying
on
the
ground
folded
in
such
a
manner
that
only
two
syllables
of
the
title
were
visible
these
two
syllables
were
aland
what
a
sudden
light
flashed
on
my
mind
aland
was
one
of
the
words
in
the
english
document
one
that
hitherto
we
had
translated
and
which
must
have
been
the
termination
of
the
proper
noun
indeed
said
glenarvan
yes
continued
paganel
with
profound
conviction
this
meaning
had
escaped
me
and
do
you
know
why
because
my
wits
were
exercised
naturally
on
the
french
document
as
it
was
most
complete
and
in
that
this
important
word
was
oh
oh
said
the
major
your
imagination
goes
too
far
paganel
and
you
forget
your
former
go
on
major
i
am
ready
to
answer
well
then
what
do
you
make
of
your
word
austra
what
it
was
at
first
it
merely
means
southern
well
and
this
syllable
indi
which
was
first
the
root
of
the
indians
and
second
the
root
of
the
word
well
the
third
and
last
time
replied
paganel
it
will
be
the
first
syllable
of
the
word
and
contin
cried
mcnabbs
does
that
still
mean
continent
no
since
new
zealand
is
only
an
what
then
asked
glenarvan
my
dear
lord
replied
paganel
i
am
going
to
translate
the
document
according
to
my
third
interpretation
and
you
shall
judge
i
only
make
two
observations
beforehand
first
forget
as
much
as
possible
preceding
interpretations
and
divest
your
mind
of
all
preconceived
notions
second
certain
parts
may
appear
to
you
strained
and
it
is
possible
that
i
translate
them
badly
but
they
are
of
no
importance
among
others
the
word
agonie
which
chokes
me
but
i
can
not
find
any
other
explanation
besides
my
interpretation
was
founded
on
the
french
document
and
don
t
forget
it
was
written
by
an
englishman
who
could
not
be
familiar
with
the
idioms
of
the
french
language
now
then
having
said
this
much
i
will
and
slowly
articulating
each
syllable
he
repeated
the
following
sentences
le
juin
de
a
apres
une
longue
agonie
dans
les
mers
australes
sur
les
cotes
de
la
nouvelle
zelande
in
english

cruelle
indigence
ils

ce
par
et
degrees
de
latitude
a
secours
ou
ils
sont
perdus
on
the
of
june
the
vessel
britannia
of
glasgow
has
foundered
after
a
long
agonie
in
the
southern
seas
on
the
coast
of
new
zealand
two
sailors
and
captain
grant
have
succeeded
in
landing
continually
a
prey
to
cruel
indigence
they
have
thrown
this
document
into
the
sea
in
longitude
and
degrees
latitude
come
to
their
help
or
they
are
lost
paganel
stopped
his
interpretation
was
admissible
but
precisely
because
it
appeared
as
likely
as
the
preceding
it
might
be
as
false
glenarvan
and
the
major
did
not
then
try
and
discuss
it
however
since
no
traces
of
the
britannia
had
yet
been
met
with
either
on
the
patagonian
or
australian
coasts
at
the
points
where
these
countries
are
crossed
by
the
parallel
the
chances
were
in
favor
of
new
zealand
now
paganel
said
glenarvan
will
you
tell
me
why
you
have
kept
this
interpretation
secret
for
nearly
two
months
because
i
did
not
wish
to
buoy
you
up
again
with
vain
hopes
besides
we
were
going
to
auckland
to
the
very
spot
indicated
by
the
latitude
of
the
but
since
then
when
we
were
dragged
out
of
the
route
why
did
you
not
speak
because
however
just
the
interpretation
it
could
do
nothing
for
the
deliverance
of
the
why
not
paganel
because
admitting
that
the
captain
was
wrecked
on
the
new
zealand
coast
now
that
two
years
have
passed
and
he
has
not
reappeared
he
must
have
perished
by
shipwreck
or
by
the
new
then
you
are
of
the
opinion
said
glenarvan
that
that
vestiges
of
the
wreck
might
be
found
but
that
the
survivors
of
the
britannia
have
beyond
doubt
keep
all
this
silent
friends
said
glenarvan
and
let
me
choose
a
fitting
moment
to
communicate
these
sad
tidings
to
captain
grant
s
chapter
xix
a
cry
in
the
night
the
crew
soon
heard
that
no
light
had
been
thrown
on
the
situation
of
captain
grant
by
the
revelations
of
ayrton
and
it
caused
profound
disappointment
among
them
for
they
had
counted
on
the
quartermaster
and
the
quartermaster
knew
nothing
which
could
put
the
duncan
on
the
right
track
the
yacht
therefore
continued
her
course
they
had
yet
to
select
the
island
for
ayrton
s
banishment
paganel
and
john
mangles
consulted
the
charts
on
board
and
exactly
on
the
parallel
found
a
little
isle
marked
by
the
name
of
maria
theresa
a
sunken
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
ocean
miles
from
the
american
coast
and
miles
from
new
zealand
the
nearest
land
on
the
north
was
the
archipelago
of
pomotou
under
the
protectorate
of
france
on
the
south
there
was
nothing
but
the
eternal
of
the
polar
sea
no
ship
would
come
to
reconnoiter
this
solitary
isle
no
echoes
from
the
world
would
ever
reach
it
the
storm
birds
only
would
rest
awhile
on
it
during
their
long
flight
and
in
many
charts
the
rock
was
not
even
marked
if
ever
complete
isolation
was
to
be
found
on
earth
it
was
on
this
little
island
ayrton
was
informed
of
its
situation
and
expressed
his
willingness
to
live
there
apart
from
his
fellows
the
head
of
the
vessel
was
in
consequence
turned
toward
it
immediately
two
days
later
at
two
o
clock
the
man
on
watch
signaled
land
on
the
horizon
this
was
maria
theresa
a
low
elongated
island
scarcely
raised
above
the
waves
and
looking
like
an
enormous
whale
it
was
still
thirty
miles
distant
from
the
yacht
whose
stem
was
rapidly
cutting
her
way
over
the
water
at
the
rate
of
sixteen
knots
an
hour
gradually
the
form
of
the
island
grew
more
distinct
on
the
horizon
the
orb
of
day
sinking
in
the
west
threw
up
its
peculiar
outlines
in
sharp
relief
a
few
peaks
of
no
great
elevation
stood
out
here
and
there
tipped
with
sunlight
at
five
o
clock
john
mangles
could
discern
a
light
smoke
rising
from
it
is
it
a
volcano
he
asked
of
paganel
who
was
gazing
at
this
new
land
through
his
telescope
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
replied
the
geographer
maria
theresa
is
a
spot
little
known
nevertheless
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
its
origin
were
due
to
some
submarine
upheaval
and
consequently
it
may
be
but
in
that
case
said
glenarvan
is
there
not
reason
to
fear
that
if
an
eruption
produced
it
an
eruption
may
carry
it
away
that
is
not
possible
replied
paganel
we
know
of
its
existence
for
several
centuries
which
is
our
security
when
the
isle
julia
emerged
from
the
mediterranean
it
did
not
remain
long
above
the
waves
and
disappeared
a
few
months
after
its
very
good
said
glenarvan
do
you
think
john
we
can
get
there
no
your
honor
i
must
not
risk
the
duncan
in
the
dark
for
i
am
unacquainted
with
the
coast
i
will
keep
under
steam
but
go
very
slowly
and
at
daybreak
we
can
send
off
a
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
maria
theresa
though
five
miles
to
leeward
appeared
only
an
elongated
shadow
scarcely
visible
the
duncan
was
always
getting
nearer
at
nine
o
clock
a
bright
glare
became
visible
and
flames
shot
up
through
the
darkness
the
light
was
steady
and
continued
that
confirms
the
supposition
of
a
volcano
said
paganel
observing
it
attentively
yet
replied
john
mangles
at
this
distance
we
ought
to
hear
the
noise
which
always
accompanies
an
eruption
and
the
east
wind
brings
no
sound
whatever
to
our
that
s
true
said
paganel
it
is
a
volcano
that
blazes
but
does
not
speak
the
gleam
seems
intermittent
too
sometimes
like
that
of
a
you
are
right
said
john
mangles
and
yet
we
are
not
on
a
lighted
ah
he
exclaimed
another
fire
on
the
shore
this
time
look
it
moves
it
has
changed
its
place
john
was
not
mistaken
a
fresh
fire
had
appeared
which
seemed
to
die
out
now
and
then
and
suddenly
flare
up
again
is
the
island
inhabited
then
said
glenarvan
by
savages
evidently
replied
paganel
but
in
that
case
we
can
not
leave
the
quartermaster
no
replied
the
major
he
would
be
too
bad
a
gift
even
to
bestow
on
we
must
find
some
other
uninhabited
island
said
glenarvan
who
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
delicacy
of
mcnabbs
i
promised
ayrton
his
life
and
i
mean
to
keep
my
at
all
events
don
t
let
us
trust
them
added
paganel
the
new
zealanders
have
the
barbarous
custom
of
deceiving
ships
by
moving
lights
like
the
wreckers
on
the
cornish
coast
in
former
times
now
the
natives
of
maria
theresa
may
have
heard
of
this
keep
her
off
a
point
called
out
john
to
the
man
at
the
helm
at
sunrise
we
shall
know
what
we
re
at
eleven
o
clock
the
passengers
and
john
mangles
retired
to
their
cabins
in
the
forepart
of
the
yacht
the
man
on
watch
was
pacing
the
deck
while
aft
there
was
no
one
but
the
man
at
the
wheel
at
this
moment
mary
grant
and
robert
came
on
the
poop
the
two
children
of
the
captain
leaning
over
the
rail
gazed
sadly
at
the
phosphorescent
waves
and
the
luminous
wake
of
the
duncan
mary
was
thinking
of
her
brother
s
future
and
robert
of
his
sister
s
their
father
was
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
both
was
this
idolized
parent
still
in
existence
must
they
give
him
up
but
no
for
what
would
life
be
without
him
what
would
become
of
them
without
him
what
would
have
become
of
them
already
but
for
lord
glenarvan
and
lady
helena
the
young
boy
old
above
his
years
through
trouble
divined
the
thoughts
that
troubled
his
sister
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
own
said
mary
we
must
never
despair
remember
the
lessons
our
father
gave
us
keep
your
courage
up
and
no
matter
what
befalls
you
let
us
show
this
obstinate
courage
which
can
rise
above
everything
up
to
this
time
sister
you
have
been
working
for
me
it
is
my
turn
now
and
i
will
work
for

robert
replied
the
young
girl
i
must
tell
you
something
resumed
robert
you
mustn
t
be
vexed
mary
why
should
i
be
vexed
my
child
and

let
me
do
it

said
mary
getting
uneasy
sister

going
to
be
a
sailor

going
to
leave
me
cried
the
young
girl
pressing
her
brother

hand
yes

a
sailor
like
my
father
and
captain

his
devotion

i
he
is
going
to
make
a
grand
sailor
out

we
are
going

me
you

willing
sister
mine
what
our
father

have
done
for
us

is
our
duty
mine
at
least
to
do
for
him
my
life
has
one
purpose
to
which
it
should
be
entirely
consecrated
that
is
to
search
and
never
cease
searching
for
my
father
who
would
never
have
given
us
up
ah
mary
how
good
our
father
was
and
so
noble
so
generous
added
mary
do
you
know
robert
he
was
already
a
glory
to
our
country
and
that
he
would
have
been
numbered
among
our
great
men
if
fate
had
not
arrested
his
yes
i
know
it
said
robert
mary
put
her
arm
around
the
boy
and
hugged
him
fondly
as
he
felt
her
tears
fall
on
his
forehead
mary
mary
he
cried
it
doesn
t
matter
what
our
friends
say
i
still
hope
and
will
always
hope
a
man
like
my
father
doesn
t
die
till
he
has
finished
his
mary
grant
could
not
reply
sobs
choked
her
voice
a
thousand
feelings
struggled
in
her
breast
at
the
news
that
fresh
attempts
were
about
to
be
made
to
recover
harry
grant
and
that
the
devotion
of
the
captain
was
so
unbounded
and
does
john
still
hope
she
asked
yes
replied
robert
he
is
a
brother
that
will
never
forsake
us
never
i
will
be
a
sailor
you
ll
say
yes
won
t
you
sister
and
let
me
join
him
in
looking
for
my
father
i
am
sure
you
are
yes
i
am
willing
said
mary
but
the
separation
she
murmured
you
will
not
be
alone
mary
i
know
that
my
friend
john
told
me
so
lady
helena
will
not
let
you
leave
her
you
are
a
woman
you
can
and
should
accept
her
kindness
to
refuse
would
be
ungrateful
but
a
man
my
father
has
said
a
hundred
times
must
make
his
own
but
what
will
become
of
our
own
dear
home
in
dundee
so
full
of
memories
we
will
keep
it
little
sister
all
that
is
settled
and
settled
so
well
by
our
friend
john
and
also
by
lord
glenarvan
he
is
to
keep
you
at
malcolm
castle
as
if
you
were
his
daughter
my
lord
told
my
friend
john
so
and
he
told
me
you
will
be
at
home
there
and
have
someone
to
speak
to
about
our
father
while
you
are
waiting
till
john
and
i
bring
him
back
to
you
some
day
ah
what
a
grand
day
that
will
be
exclaimed
robert
his
face
glowing
with
enthusiasm
my
boy
my
brother
replied
mary
how
happy
my
father
would
be
if
he
could
hear
you
how
much
you
are
like
him
dear
robert
like
our
dear
dear
father
when
you
grow
up
you
ll
be
just
i
hope
i
may
said
robert
blushing
with
filial
and
sacred
pride
but
how
shall
we
requite
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
said
mary
grant
oh
that
will
not
be
difficult
replied
robert
with
boyish
confidence
we
will
love
and
revere
them
and
we
will
tell
them
so
and
we
will
give
them
plenty
of
kisses
and
some
day
when
we
can
get
the
chance
we
will
die
for
we
ll
live
for
them
on
the
contrary
replied
the
young
girl
covering
her
brother
s
forehead
with
kisses
they
will
like
that
better
and
so
shall
the
two
children
then
relapsed
into
silence
gazing
out
into
the
dark
night
and
giving
way
to
long
reveries
interrupted
occasionally
by
a
question
or
remark
from
one
to
the
other
a
long
swell
undulated
the
surface
of
the
calm
sea
and
the
screw
turned
up
a
luminous
furrow
in
the
darkness
a
strange
and
altogether
supernatural
incident
now
occurred
the
brother
and
sister
by
some
of
those
magnetic
communications
which
link
souls
mysteriously
together
were
the
subjects
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
instant
of
the
same
hallucination
out
of
the
midst
of
these
waves
with
their
alternations
of
light
and
shadow
a
deep
plaintive
voice
sent
up
a
cry
the
tones
of
which
thrilled
through
every
fiber
of
their
being
come
come
were
the
words
which
fell
on
their
ears
they
both
started
up
and
leaned
over
the
railing
and
peered
into
the
gloom
with
questioning
eyes
mary
you
heard
that
you
heard
that
cried
robert
but
they
saw
nothing
but
the
long
shadow
that
stretched
before
them
robert
said
mary
pale
with
emotion
i
thought
yes
i
thought
as
you
did
that
we
must
both
be
ill
with
fever
a
second
time
the
cry
reached
them
and
this
time
the
illusion
was
so
great
that
they
both
exclaimed
simultaneously
my
father
my
father
it
was
too
much
for
mary
overcome
with
emotion
she
fell
fainting
into
robert
s
arms
help
shouted
robert
my
sister
my
father
help
help
the
man
at
the
wheel
darted
forward
to
lift
up
the
girl
the
sailors
on
watch
ran
to
assist
and
john
mangles
lady
helena
and
glenarvan
were
hastily
roused
from
sleep
my
sister
is
dying
and
my
father
is
there
exclaimed
robert
pointing
to
the
waves
they
were
wholly
at
a
loss
to
understand
him
yes
he
repeated
my
father
is
there
i
heard
my
father
s
voice
mary
heard
it
too
just
at
this
moment
mary
grant
recovering
consciousness
but
wandering
and
excited
called
out
my
father
my
father
is
there
and
the
poor
girl
started
up
and
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
yacht
wanted
to
throw
herself
into
the
sea
my
lord
lady
helena
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
i
tell
you
my
father
is
there
i
can
declare
that
i
heard
his
voice
come
out
of
the
waves
like
a
wail
as
if
it
were
a
last
the
young
girl
went
off
again
into
convulsions
and
spasms
which
became
so
violent
that
she
had
to
be
carried
to
her
cabin
where
lady
helena
lavished
every
care
on
her
robert
kept
on
repeating
my
father
my
father
is
there
i
am
sure
of
it
my
lord
the
spectators
of
this
painful
scene
saw
that
the
captain
s
children
were
laboring
under
an
hallucination
but
how
were
they
to
be
undeceived
glenarvan
made
an
attempt
however
he
took
robert
s
hand
and
said
you
say
you
heard
your
father
s
voice
my
dear
boy
yes
my
lord
there
in
the
middle
of
the
waves
he
cried
out
come
come
and
did
you
recognize
his
voice
yes
i
recognized
it
immediately
yes
yes
i
can
swear
to
it
my
sister
heard
it
and
recognized
it
as
well
how
could
we
both
be
deceived
my
lord
do
let
us
go
to
my
father
s
help
a
boat
a
boat
glenarvan
saw
it
was
impossible
to
undeceive
the
poor
boy
but
he
tried
once
more
by
saying
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
hawkins
you
were
at
the
wheel
were
you
not
when
miss
mary
was
so
strangely
attacked
yes
your
honor
replied
hawkins
and
you
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
now
robert
see
if
it
had
been
hawkins
s
father
returned
the
boy
with
indomitable
energy
hawkins
would
not
say
he
had
heard
nothing
it
was
my
father
my
lord
my
sobs
choked
his
voice
he
became
pale
and
silent
and
presently
fell
down
insensible
like
his
sister
glenarvan
had
him
carried
to
his
bed
where
he
lay
in
a
deep
swoon
poor
orphans
said
john
mangles
it
is
a
terrible
trial
they
have
to
bear
yes
said
glenarvan
excessive
grief
has
produced
the
same
hallucination
in
both
of
them
and
at
the
same
in
both
of
them
muttered
paganel
that
s
strange
and
pure
science
would
say
he
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
and
listened
attentively
making
a
sign
to
the
rest
to
keep
still
but
profound
silence
reigned
around
paganel
shouted
his
loudest
no
response
came
it
is
strange
repeated
the
geographer
going
back
to
his
cabin
close
sympathy
in
thought
and
grief
does
not
suffice
to
explain
this
next
day
march
at
at
dawn
the
passengers
including
mary
and
robert
who
would
not
stay
behind
were
all
assembled
on
the
poop
each
one
eager
to
examine
the
land
they
had
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
night
before
the
yacht
was
coasting
along
the
island
at
the
distance
of
about
a
mile
and
its
smallest
details
could
be
seen
by
the
eye
suddenly
robert
gave
a
loud
cry
and
exclaimed
he
could
see
two
men
running
about
and
gesticulating
and
a
third
was
waving
a
flag
the
union
jack
said
john
mangles
who
had
caught
up
a
true
enough
said
paganel
turning
sharply
round
toward
robert
my
lord
said
robert
trembling
with
emotion
if
you
don
t
want
me
to
swim
to
the
shore
let
a
boat
be
lowered
oh
my
lord
i
implore
you
to
let
me
be
the
first
to
no
one
dared
to
speak
what
on
this
little
isle
crossed
by
the
parallel
there
were
three
men
shipwrecked
englishmen
instantaneously
everyone
thought
of
the
voice
heard
by
robert
and
mary
the
preceding
night
the
children
were
right
perhaps
in
the
affirmation
the
sound
of
a
voice
might
have
reached
them
but
this
voice
was
it
their
father
s
no
alas
most
assuredly
no
and
as
they
thought
of
the
dreadful
disappointment
that
awaited
them
they
trembled
lest
this
new
trial
should
crush
them
completely
but
who
could
stop
them
from
going
on
shore
lord
glenarvan
had
not
the
heart
to
do
it
lower
a
boat
he
called
out
another
minute
and
the
boat
was
ready
the
two
children
of
captain
grant
glenarvan
john
mangles
and
paganel
rushed
into
it
and
six
sailors
who
rowed
so
vigorously
that
they
were
presently
almost
close
to
the
shore
at
ten
fathoms
distance
a
piercing
cry
broke
from
mary
s
lips
my
father
she
exclaimed
a
man
was
standing
on
the
beach
between
two
others
his
tall
powerful
form
and
his
physiognomy
with
its
mingled
expression
of
boldness
and
gentleness
bore
a
resemblance
both
to
mary
and
robert
this
was
indeed
the
man
the
children
had
so
often
described
their
hearts
had
not
deceived
them
this
was
their
father
captain
grant
the
captain
had
heard
mary
s
cry
for
he
held
out
his
arms
and
fell
flat
on
the
sand
as
if
struck
by
a
thunderbolt

does
not

for
both
father
and
children
recovered
before
they
had
reached
the
yacht
the
scene
which
followed
who
can
describe
language
fails
the
whole
crew
wept
aloud
at
the
sight
of
these
three
clasped
together
in
a
close
silent
embrace
the
moment
harry
grant
came
on
deck
he
knelt
down
reverently
the
pious
scotchman
s
first
act
on
touching
the
yacht
which
to
him
was
the
soil
of
his
native
land
was
to
return
thanks
to
the
god
of
his
deliverance
then
turning
to
lady
helena
and
lord
glenarvan
and
his
companions
he
thanked
them
in
broken
words
for
his
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
during
the
short
passage
from
the
isle
to
the
yacht
his
children
had
given
him
a
brief
sketch
of
the
duncan
s
history
what
an
immense
debt
he
owed
to
this
noble
lady
and
her
friends
from
lord
glenarvan
down
to
the
lowest
sailor
on
board
how
all
had
struggled
and
suffered
for
him
harry
grant
expressed
his
gratitude
with
such
simplicity
and
nobleness
his
manly
face
suffused
with
pure
and
sweet
emotion
that
the
whole
crew
felt
amply
recompensed
for
the
trials
they
had
undergone
even
the
impassable
major
himself
felt
a
tear
steal
down
his
cheek
in
spite
of
all
his
while
the
good
simple
paganel
cried
like
a
child
who
does
not
care
who
sees
his
tears
harry
grant
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
daughter
he
thought
her
beautiful
charming
and
he
not
only
said
so
to
himself
but
repeated
it
aloud
and
appealed
to
lady
helena
for
confirmation
of
his
opinion
as
if
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
not
blinded
by
his
paternal
affection
his
boy
too
came
in
for
admiration
how
he
has
grown
he
is
a
man
was
his
delighted
exclamation
and
he
covered
the
two
children
so
dear
to
him
with
the
kisses
he
had
been
heaping
up
for
them
during
his
two
years
of
absence
robert
then
presented
all
his
friends
successively
and
found
means
always
to
vary
the
formula
of
introduction
though
he
had
to
say
the
same
thing
about
each
the
fact
was
each
and
all
had
been
perfect
in
the
children
s
eyes
john
mangles
blushed
like
a
child
when
his
turn
came
and
his
voice
trembled
as
he
spoke
to
mary
s
father
lady
helena
gave
captain
grant
a
narrative
of
the
voyage
and
made
him
proud
of
his
son
and
daughter
she
told
him
of
the
young
hero
s
exploits
and
how
the
lad
had
already
paid
back
part
of
the
paternal
debt
to
lord
glenarvan
john
mangles
sang
mary
s
praises
in
such
terms
that
harry
grant
acting
on
a
hint
from
lady
helena
put
his
daughter
s
hand
into
that
of
the
brave
young
captain
and
turning
to
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
said
my
lord
and
you
madam
also
give
your
blessing
to
our
when
everything
had
been
said
and
over
and
over
again
glenarvan
informed
harry
grant
about
ayrton
grant
confirmed
the
quartermaster
s
confession
as
far
as
his
disembarkation
on
the
coast
of
australia
was
concerned
he
is
an
intelligent
intrepid
man
he
added
whose
passions
have
led
him
astray
may
reflection
and
repentance
bring
him
to
a
better
mind
but
before
ayrton
was
transferred
harry
grant
wished
to
do
the
honors
of
his
rock
to
his
friends
he
invited
them
to
visit
his
wooden
house
and
dine
with
him
in
robinson
crusoe
fashion
glenarvan
and
his
friends
accepted
the
invitation
most
willingly
robert
and
mary
were
eagerly
longing
to
see
the
solitary
house
where
their
father
had
so
often
wept
at
the
thought
of
them
a
boat
was
manned
and
the
captain
and
his
two
children
lord
and
lady
glenarvan
the
major
john
mangles
and
paganel
landed
on
the
shores
of
the
island
a
few
hours
sufficed
to
explore
the
whole
domain
of
harry
grant
it
was
in
fact
the
summit
of
a
submarine
mountain
a
plateau
composed
of
basaltic
rocks
and
volcanic
debris
during
the
geological
epochs
of
the
earth
this
mountain
had
gradually
emerged
from
the
depths
of
the
pacific
through
the
action
of
the
subterranean
fires
but
for
ages
back
the
volcano
had
been
a
peaceful
mountain
and
the
crater
an
island
rising
out
of
the
liquid
plain
then
soil
formed
the
vegetable
kingdom
took
possession
of
this
new
land
several
whalers
landed
domestic
animals
there
in
passing
goats
and
pigs
which
multiplied
and
ran
wild
and
the
three
kingdoms
of
nature
were
now
displayed
on
this
island
sunk
in
mid
ocean
when
the
survivors
of
the
shipwrecked
britannia
took
refuge
there
the
hand
of
man
began
to
organize
the
efforts
of
nature
in
two
years
and
a
half
harry
grant
and
his
two
sailors
had
metamorphosed
the
island
several
acres
of
land
were
stocked
with
vegetables
of
excellent
quality
the
house
was
shaded
by
luxuriant
the
magnificent
ocean
stretched
before
the
windows
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
harry
grant
had
the
table
placed
beneath
the
grand
trees
and
all
the
guests
seated
themselves
a
hind
quarter
of
a
goat
nardou
bread
several
bowls
of
milk
two
or
three
roots
of
wild
endive
and
pure
fresh
water
composed
the
simple
repast
worthy
of
the
shepherds
of
arcadia
paganel
was
enchanted
his
old
fancies
about
robinson
crusoe
revived
in
full
force
he
is
not
at
all
to
be
pitied
that
scoundrel
ayrton
he
exclaimed
enthusiastically
this
little
isle
is
just
a
paradise
yes
replied
harry
grant
a
paradise
to
these
poor
shipwrecked
fellows
that
heaven
had
pity
on
but
i
am
sorry
that
maria
theresa
was
not
an
extensive
and
fertile
island
with
a
river
instead
of
a
stream
and
a
port
instead
of
a
tiny
bay
exposed
to
the
open
and
why
captain
asked
glenarvan
because
i
should
have
made
it
the
foundation
of
the
colony
with
which
i
mean
to
dower
ah
captain
grant
you
have
not
given
up
the
project
then
which
made
you
so
popular
in
our
old
country
no
my
lord
and
god
has
only
saved
me
through
your
efforts
that
i
might
accomplish
my
task
my
poor
brothers
in
old
caledonia
all
who
are
needy
must
have
a
refuge
provided
for
them
in
another
land
against
their
misery
and
my
dear
country
must
have
a
colony
of
her
own
for
herself
alone
somewhere
in
these
seas
where
she
may
find
that
independence
and
comfort
she
so
lacks
in
ah
that
is
very
true
captain
grant
said
lady
helena
this
is
a
grand
project
of
yours
and
worthy
of
a
noble
heart
but
this
little
isle
no
madam
it
is
a
rock
only
fit
at
most
to
support
a
few
settlers
while
what
we
need
is
a
vast
country
whose
virgin
soil
abounds
in
untouched
stores
of
wealth
replied
the
captain
well
captain
exclaimed
glenarvan
the
future
is
ours
and
this
country
we
will
seek
for
and
the
two
brave
scotchmen
joined
hands
in
a
hearty
grip
and
so
sealed
the
compact
a
general
wish
was
expressed
to
hear
while
they
were
on
the
island
the
account
of
the
shipwreck
of
the
britannia
and
of
the
two
years
spent
by
the
survivors
in
this
very
place
harry
grant
was
delighted
to
gratify
their
curiosity
and
commenced
his
narration
forthwith
my
story
he
said
is
that
of
all
the
robinson
crusoes
cast
upon
an
island
with
only
god
and
themselves
to
rely
on
and
feeling
it
a
duty
to
struggle
for
life
with
the
elements
it
was
during
the
night
of
the
or
of
june
that
the
britannia
disabled
by
a
six
days
storm
struck
against
the
rocks
of
maria
theresa
the
sea
was
mountains
high
and
lifeboats
were
useless
my
unfortunate
crew
all
perished
except
bob
learce
and
joe
bell
who
with
myself
managed
to
reach
shore
after
twenty
unsuccessful
attempts
the
land
which
received
us
was
only
an
uninhabited
island
two
miles
broad
and
five
long
with
about
thirty
trees
in
the
interior
a
few
meadows
and
a
brook
of
fresh
water
which
fortunately
never
dried
up
alone
with
my
sailors
in
this
corner
of
the
globe
i
did
not
despair
i
put
my
trust
in
god
and
accustomed
myself
to
struggle
resolutely
for
existence
bob
and
joe
my
brave
companions
in
misfortune
my
friends
seconded
me
energetically
we
began
like
the
fictitious
robinson
crusoe
of
defoe
our
model
by
collecting
the
planks
of
the
ship
the
tools
a
little
powder
and
firearms
and
a
bag
of
precious
seeds
the
first
few
days
were
painful
enough
but
hunting
and
fishing
soon
afforded
us
a
sure
supply
of
food
for
wild
goats
were
in
abundance
in
the
interior
of
the
island
and
marine
animals
abounded
on
the
coast
by
degrees
we
fell
into
regular
ways
and
habits
of
life
i
had
saved
my
instruments
from
the
wreck
and
knew
exactly
the
position
of
the
island
i
found
we
were
out
of
the
route
of
vessels
and
could
not
be
rescued
unless
by
some
providential
chance
i
accepted
our
trying
lot
composedly
always
thinking
however
of
my
dear
ones
remembering
them
every
day
in
my
prayers
though
never
hoping
to
see
them
again
however
we
toiled
on
resolutely
and
before
long
several
acres
of
land
were
sown
with
the
seed
off
the
britannia
potatoes
endive
sorrel
and
other
vegetables
besides
gave
wholesome
variety
to
our
daily
fare
we
caught
some
young
kids
which
soon
grew
quite
tame
we
had
milk
and
butter
the
nardou
which
grew
abundantly
in
dried
up
creeks
supplied
us
with
tolerably
substantial
bread
and
we
had
no
longer
any
fears
for
our
material
life
we
had
built
a
log
hut
with
the
debris
of
the
britannia
and
this
was
covered
over
with
sail
cloth
carefully
tarred
over
and
beneath
this
secure
shelter
the
rainy
season
passed
comfortably
many
a
plan
was
discussed
here
and
many
a
dream
indulged
in
the
brightest
of
which
is
this
day
realized
i
had
at
first
the
idea
of
trying
to
brave
the
perils
of
the
ocean
in
a
canoe
made
out
of
the
spars
of
the
ship
but
miles
lay
between
us
and
the
nearest
coast
that
is
to
say
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
of
pomotou
no
boat
could
have
stood
so
long
a
voyage
i
therefore
relinquished
my
scheme
and
looked
for
no
deliverance
except
from
a
divine
hand
ah
my
poor
children
how
often
we
have
stood
on
the
top
of
the
rocks
and
watched
the
few
vessels
passing
in
the
distance
far
out
at
sea
during
the
whole
period
of
our
exile
only
two
or
three
vessels
appeared
on
the
horizon
and
those
only
to
disappear
again
immediately
two
years
and
a
half
were
spent
in
this
manner
we
gave
up
hoping
but
yet
did
not
despair
at
last
early
yesterday
morning
when
i
was
standing
on
the
highest
peak
of
the
island
i
noticed
a
light
smoke
rising
in
the
west
it
increased
and
soon
a
ship
appeared
in
sight
it
seemed
to
be
coming
toward
us
but
would
it
not
rather
steer
clear
of
an
island
where
there
was
no
harbor
ah
what
a
day
of
agony
that
was
my
heart
was
almost
bursting
my
comrades
kindled
a
fire
on
one
of
the
peaks
night
came
on
but
no
signal
came
from
the
yacht
deliverance
was
there
however
were
we
to
see
it
vanish
from
our
eyes
i
hesitated
no
longer
the
darkness
was
growing
deeper
the
ship
might
double
the
island
during
the
night
i
jumped
into
the
sea
and
attempted
to
make
my
way
toward
it
hope
trebled
my
strength
i
cleft
the
waves
with
superhuman
vigor
and
had
got
so
near
the
yacht
that
i
was
scarcely
thirty
fathoms
off
when
it
tacked
about
this
provoked
me
to
the
despairing
cry
which
only
my
two
children
heard
it
was
no
illusion
then
i
came
back
to
the
shore
exhausted
and
overcome
with
emotion
and
fatigue
my
two
sailors
received
me
half
dead
it
was
a
horrible
night
this
last
we
spent
on
the
island
and
we
believed
ourselves
abandoned
forever
when
day
dawned
and
there
was
the
yacht
sailing
nearly
alongside
under
easy
steam
your
boat
was
lowered
we
were
saved
and
oh
wonder
of
divine
goodness
my
children
my
beloved
children
were
there
holding
out
their
arms
to
me
robert
and
mary
almost
smothered
their
father
with
kisses
and
caresses
as
he
ended
his
narrative
it
was
now
for
the
first
time
that
the
captain
heard
that
he
owed
his
deliverance
to
the
somewhat
hieroglyphical
document
which
he
had
placed
in
a
bottle
and
confined
to
the
mercy
of
the
ocean
but
what
were
jacques
paganel
s
thoughts
during
captain
grant
s
recital
the
worthy
geographer
was
turning
over
in
his
brain
for
the
thousandth
time
the
words
of
the
document
he
pondered
his
three
successive
interpretations
all
of
which
had
proved
false
how
had
this
island
called
maria
theresa
been
indicated
in
the
papers
originally
at
last
paganel
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
seizing
harry
grant
s
hand
he
exclaimed
captain
will
you
tell
me
at
last
what
really
was
in
your
indecipherable
document
a
general
curiosity
was
excited
by
this
question
of
the
geographer
for
the
enigma
which
had
been
for
nine
months
a
mystery
was
about
to
be
explained
well
captain
repeated
paganel
do
you
remember
the
precise
words
of
the
document
exactly
replied
harry
grant
and
not
a
day
has
passed
without
my
recalling
to
memory
words
with
which
our
last
hopes
were
and
what
are
they
captain
asked
glenarvan
speak
for
our
is
wounded
to
the
quick
i
am
ready
to
satisfy
you
replied
harry
grant
but
you
know
to
multiply
the
chances
of
safety
i
had
inclosed
three
documents
in
the
bottle
in
three
different
languages
which
is
it
you
wish
to
hear
they
are
not
identical
then
cried
paganel
yes
they
are
almost
to
a
well
then
let
us
have
the
french
document
replied
glenarvan
that
is
the
one
that
is
most
respected
by
the
waves
and
the
one
on
which
our
interpretations
have
been
mostly
my
lord
i
will
give
it
you
word
for
word
replied
harry
grant

the
name
of

paganel
had
started
up
hastily
and
now
being
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
he
called
out
how
can
it
be
isle
tabor
why
this
is
maria
theresa
undoubtedly
monsieur
paganel
replied
harry
grant
it
is
maria
theresa
on
the
english
and
german
charts
but
is
named
tabor
on
the
french
ones
at
this
moment
a
vigorous
thump
on
paganel
s
shoulder
almost
bent
him
double
truth
obliges
us
to
say
it
was
the
major
that
dealt
the
blow
though
strangely
contrary
to
his
usual
strict
politeness
geographer
said
mcnabbs
in
a
tone
of
the
most
supreme
contempt
but
paganel
had
not
even
felt
the
major
s
hand
what
was
that
compared
to
the
geographical
blow
which
had
stunned
him
he
had
been
gradually
getting
nearer
the
truth
however
as
he
learned
from
captain
grant
he
had
almost
entirely
deciphered
the
indecipherable
document
the
names
patagonia
australia
new
zealand
had
appeared
to
him
in
turn
with
absolute
certainty
contin
at
first
continent
had
gradually
reached
its
true
meaning
had
successively
signified
and
at
last
the
right
word
was
found
indigence
but
one
mutilated
word
abor
had
baffled
the
geographer
s
sagacity
paganel
had
persisted
in
making
it
the
root
of
the
verb
aborder
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
proper
name
the
french
name
of
the
isle
tabor
the
isle
which
had
been
a
refuge
for
the
shipwrecked
sailors
of
the
britannia
it
was
difficult
to
avoid
falling
into
the
error
however
for
on
the
english
planispheres
on
the
duncan
the
little
isle
was
marked
maria
theresa
no
matter
cried
paganel
tearing
his
hair
i
ought
not
to
have
forgotten
its
double
appellation
it
is
an
unpardonable
mistake
one
unworthy
of
a
secretary
of
the
geographical
society
i
am
disgraced
come
come
monsieur
paganel
said
lady
helena
moderate
your
no
madam
no
i
am
a
mere
ass
and
not
even
a
learned
one
added
the
major
by
way
of
consolation
when
the
meal
was
over
harry
grant
put
everything
in
order
in
his
house
he
took
nothing
away
wishing
the
guilty
to
inherit
the
riches
of
the
innocent
then
they
returned
to
the
vessel
and
as
glenarvan
had
determined
to
start
the
same
day
he
gave
immediate
orders
for
the
disembarkation
of
the
quartermaster
ayrton
was
brought
up
on
the
poop
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
harry
grant
it
is
i
ayrton
said
grant
yes
it
is
you
captain
replied
ayrton
without
the
least
sign
of
surprise
at
harry
grant
s
recovery
well
i
am
not
sorry
to
see
you
again
in
good
it
seems
ayrton
that
i
made
a
mistake
in
landing
you
on
an
inhabited
it
seems
so
you
are
going
to
take
my
place
on
this
uninhabited
island
may
heaven
give
you
repentance
amen
said
ayrton
calmly
glenarvan
then
addressed
the
quartermaster
it
is
still
your
wish
then
ayrton
to
be
left
behind
yes
my
lord
and
isle
tabor
meets
your
wishes
now
then
listen
to
my
last
words
ayrton
you
will
be
cut
off
here
from
all
the
world
and
no
communication
with
your
fellows
is
possible
miracles
are
rare
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
quit
this
isle
you
will
be
alone
with
no
eye
upon
you
but
that
of
god
who
reads
the
deepest
secrets
of
the
heart
but
you
will
be
neither
lost
nor
forsaken
as
captain
grant
was
unworthy
as
you
are
of
anyone
s
remembrance
you
will
not
be
dropped
out
of
recollection
i
know
where
you
are
ayrton
i
know
where
to
find
you
i
shall
never
god
keep
your
honor
was
all
ayrton
s
reply
these
were
the
final
words
exchanged
between
glenarvan
and
the
quartermaster
the
boat
was
ready
and
ayrton
got
into
it
john
mangles
had
previously
conveyed
to
the
island
several
cases
of
preserved
food
besides
clothing
and
tools
and
firearms
and
a
supply
of
powder
and
shot
the
quartermaster
could
commence
a
new
life
of
honest
labor
nothing
was
lacking
not
even
books
among
others
the
bible
so
dear
to
english
hearts
the
parting
hour
had
come
the
crew
and
all
the
passengers
were
assembled
on
deck
more
than
one
felt
his
heart
swell
with
emotion
mary
grant
and
lady
helena
could
not
restrain
their
feelings
must
it
be
done
said
the
young
wife
to
her
husband
must
the
poor
man
be
left
there
he
must
helena
replied
lord
glenarvan
it
is
in
expiation
of
his
at
that
moment
the
boat
in
charge
of
john
mangles
turned
away
ayrton
who
remained
standing
and
still
unmoved
took
off
his
cap
and
bowed
gravely
glenarvan
uncovered
and
all
the
crew
followed
his
example
as
if
in
presence
of
a
man
who
was
about
to
die
and
the
boat
went
off
in
profound
silence
on
reaching
land
ayrton
jumped
on
the
sandy
shore
and
the
boat
returned
to
the
yacht
it
was
then
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
from
the
poop
the
passengers
could
see
the
quartermaster
gazing
at
the
ship
standing
with
folded
arms
on
a
rock
motionless
as
a
statue
shall
we
set
sail
my
lord
asked
john
mangles
yes
john
replied
glenarvan
hastily
more
moved
than
he
cared
to
show
go
on
shouted
john
to
the
engineer
the
steam
hissed
and
puffed
out
the
screw
began
to
stir
the
waves
and
by
eight
o
clock
the
last
peaks
of
isle
tabor
disappeared
in
the
shadows
of
the
night
chapter
xxi
paganel
s
last
entanglement
on
the
of
march
eleven
days
after
leaving
the
island
the
duncan
sighted
the
american
coast
and
next
day
dropped
anchor
in
the
bay
of
talcahuano
they
had
come
back
again
after
a
voyage
of
five
months
during
which
and
keeping
strictly
along
the
parallel
they
had
gone
round
the
world
the
passengers
in
this
memorable
expedition
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
the
travelers
club
had
visited
chili
the
pampas
the
argentine
republic
the
atlantic
the
island
of
tristan
d
acunha
the
indian
ocean
amsterdam
island
australia
new
zealand
isle
tabor
and
the
pacific
their
search
had
not
been
fruitless
for
they
were
bringing
back
the
survivors
of
the
shipwrecked
britannia
not
one
of
the
brave
scots
who
set
out
at
the
summons
of
their
chief
but
could
answer
to
their
names
all
were
returning
to
their
old
scotia
as
soon
as
the
duncan
had
she
sailed
along
the
coast
of
patagonia
doubled
cape
horn
and
made
a
swift
run
up
the
atlantic
ocean
no
voyage
could
be
more
devoid
of
incident
the
yacht
was
simply
carrying
home
a
cargo
of
happiness
there
was
no
secret
now
on
board
not
even
john
mangles
s
attachment
to
mary
grant
yes
there
was
one
mystery
still
which
greatly
excited
mcnabbs
s
curiosity
why
was
it
that
paganel
remained
always
hermetically
fastened
up
in
his
clothes
with
a
big
comforter
round
his
throat
and
up
to
his
very
ears
the
major
was
burning
with
desire
to
know
the
reason
of
this
singular
fashion
but
in
spite
of
interrogations
allusions
and
suspicions
on
the
part
of
mcnabbs
paganel
would
not
unbutton
not
even
when
the
duncan
crossed
the
line
and
the
heat
was
so
great
that
the
seams
of
the
deck
were
melting
he
is
so
distrait
that
he
thinks
he
is
at
petersburg
said
the
major
when
he
saw
the
geographer
wrapped
in
an
immense
as
if
the
mercury
had
been
frozen
in
the
thermometer
at
last
on
the
of
may
days
from
the
time
of
leaving
talcahuano
john
mangles
sighted
the
lights
of
cape
clear
the
yacht
entered
george
s
channel
crossed
the
irish
sea
and
on
the
of
may
reached
the
firth
of
clyde
at
o
clock
she
dropped
anchor
off
dunbarton
and
at
the
passengers
arrived
at
malcolm
castle
amidst
the
enthusiastic
cheering
of
the
highlanders
as
fate
would
have
it
then
harry
grant
and
his
two
companions
were
saved
john
mangles
wedded
mary
grant
in
the
old
cathedral
of
mungo
and
paxton
the
same
clergyman
who
had
prayed
nine
months
before
for
the
deliverance
of
the
father
now
blessed
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
and
his
deliverer
robert
was
to
become
a
sailor
like
harry
grant
and
john
mangles
and
take
part
with
them
in
the
captain
s
grand
projects
under
the
auspices
of
lord
glenarvan
but
fate
also
decreed
that
paganel
was
not
to
die
a
bachelor
probably
so
the
fact
was
the
learned
geographer
after
his
heroic
exploits
could
not
escape
celebrity
his
blunders
made
quite
a
furore
among
the
fashionables
of
scotland
and
he
was
overwhelmed
with
courtesies
it
was
then
that
an
amiable
lady
about
thirty
years
of
age
in
fact
a
cousin
of
mcnabbs
a
little
eccentric
herself
but
good
and
still
charming
fell
in
love
with
the
geographer
s
oddities
and
offered
him
her
hand
forty
thousand
pounds
went
with
it
but
that
was
not
mentioned
paganel
was
far
from
being
insensible
to
the
sentiments
of
miss
arabella
but
yet
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
it
was
the
major
who
was
the
medium
of
communication
between
these
two
souls
evidently
made
for
each
other
he
even
told
paganel
that
his
marriage
was
the
last
freak
he
would
be
able
to
allow
himself
paganel
was
in
a
great
state
of
embarrassment
but
strangely
enough
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
speak
the
fatal
word
does
not
miss
arabella
please
you
then
asked
mcnabbs
oh
major
she
is
charming
exclaimed
paganel
a
thousand
times
too
charming
and
if
i
must
tell
you
all
she
would
please
me
better
if
she
were
less
so
i
wish
she
had
a
defect
be
easy
on
that
score
replied
the
major
she
has
and
more
than
one
the
most
perfect
woman
in
the
world
has
always
her
quota
so
paganel
it
is
settled
then
i
suppose
i
dare
come
now
my
learned
friend
what
makes
you
hesitate
i
am
unworthy
of
miss
arabella
was
the
invariable
reply
of
the
geographer
and
to
this
he
would
stick
at
last
one
day
being
fairly
driven
in
a
corner
by
the
intractable
major
he
ended
by
confiding
to
him
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
a
certain
peculiarity
which
would
facilitate
his
apprehension
should
the
police
ever
be
on
his
track
bah
said
the
major
it
is
really
as
i
tell
you
replied
paganel
what
does
it
matter
my
worthy
friend
do
you
think
so
major
on
the
contrary
it
only
makes
you
more
uncommon
it
adds
to
your
personal
merits
it
is
the
very
thing
to
make
you
the
nonpareil
husband
that
arabella
dreams
and
the
major
with
imperturbable
gravity
left
paganel
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
disquietude
a
short
conversation
ensued
between
mcnabbs
and
miss
arabella
a
fortnight
afterwards
the
marriage
was
celebrated
in
grand
style
in
the
chapel
of
malcolm
castle
paganel
looked
magnificent
but
closely
buttoned
up
and
miss
arabella
was
arrayed
in
splendor
and
this
secret
of
the
geographer
would
have
been
forever
buried
in
oblivion
if
the
major
had
not
mentioned
it
to
glenarvan
and
he
could
not
hide
it
from
lady
helena
who
gave
a
hint
to
mangles
to
make
a
long
story
short
it
got
in
the
end
to
olbinett
s
ears
and
soon
became
noised
abroad
jacques
paganel
during
his
three
days
captivity
among
the
maories
had
been
tattooed
from
the
feet
to
the
shoulders
and
he
bore
on
his
chest
a
heraldic
kiwi
with
outspread
wings
which
was
biting
at
his
heart
this
was
the
only
adventure
of
his
grand
voyage
that
paganel
could
never
get
over
and
he
always
bore
a
grudge
to
new
zealand
on
account
of
it
it
was
for
this
reason
too
that
notwithstanding
solicitation
and
regrets
he
never
would
return
to
france
he
dreaded
lest
he
should
expose
the
whole
geographical
society
in
his
person
to
the
jests
of
caricaturists
and
low
newspapers
by
their
secretary
coming
back
tattooed
the
return
of
the
captain
to
scotland
was
a
national
event
and
harry
grant
was
soon
the
most
popular
man
in
old
caledonia
his
son
robert
became
a
sailor
like
himself
and
captain
mangles
and
under
the
patronage
of
lord
glenarvan
they
resumed
the
project
of
founding
a
scotch
colony
in
the
southern
seas
