the
black
tulip
by

pere
chapter
a
grateful
people
on
the
of
august
the
city
of
the
hague
always
so
lively
so
neat
and
so
trim
that
one
might
believe
every
day
to
be
sunday
with
its
shady
park
with
its
tall
trees
spreading
over
its
gothic
houses
with
its
canals
like
large
mirrors
in
which
its
steeples
and
its
almost
eastern
cupolas
are
reflected
the
city
of
the
hague
the
capital
of
the
seven
united
provinces
was
swelling
in
all
its
arteries
with
a
black
and
red
stream
of
hurried
panting
and
restless
citizens
who
with
their
knives
in
their
girdles
muskets
on
their
shoulders
or
sticks
in
their
hands
were
pushing
on
to
the
buytenhof
a
terrible
prison
the
grated
windows
of
which
are
still
shown
where
on
the
charge
of
attempted
murder
preferred
against
him
by
the
surgeon
tyckelaer
cornelius
de
witt
the
brother
of
the
grand
pensionary
of
holland
was
confined
if
the
history
of
that
time
and
especially
that
of
the
year
in
the
middle
of
which
our
narrative
commences
were
not
indissolubly
connected
with
the
two
names
just
mentioned
the
few
explanatory
pages
which
we
are
about
to
add
might
appear
quite
supererogatory
but
we
will
from
the
very
first
apprise
the
reader
our
old
friend
to
whom
we
are
wont
on
the
first
page
to
promise
amusement
and
with
whom
we
always
try
to
keep
our
word
as
well
as
is
in
our
power
that
this
explanation
is
as
indispensable
to
the
right
understanding
of
our
story
as
to
that
of
the
great
event
itself
on
which
it
is
based
cornelius
de
witt
ruart
de
pulten
that
is
to
say
warden
of
the
dikes
of
dort
his
native
town
and
member
of
the
assembly
of
the
states
of
holland
was
years
of
age
when
the
dutch
people
tired
of
the
republic
such
as
john
de
witt
the
grand
pensionary
of
holland
understood
it
at
once
conceived
a
most
violent
affection
for
the
stadtholderate
which
had
been
abolished
for
ever
in
holland
by
the
perpetual
edict
forced
by
john
de
witt
upon
the
united
provinces
as
it
rarely
happens
that
public
opinion
in
its
whimsical
flights
does
not
identify
a
principle
with
a
man
thus
the
people
saw
the
personification
of
the
republic
in
the
two
stern
figures
of
the
brothers
de
witt
those
romans
of
holland
spurning
to
pander
to
the
fancies
of
the
mob
and
wedding
themselves
with
unbending
fidelity
to
liberty
without
licentiousness
and
prosperity
without
the
waste
of
superfluity
on
the
other
hand
the
stadtholderate
recalled
to
the
popular
mind
the
grave
and
thoughtful
image
of
the
young
prince
william
of
orange
the
brothers
de
witt
humoured
louis
whose
moral
influence
was
felt
by
the
whole
of
europe
and
the
pressure
of
whose
material
power
holland
had
been
made
to
feel
in
that
marvellous
campaign
on
the
rhine
which
in
the
space
of
three
months
had
laid
the
power
of
the
united
provinces
prostrate
louis
xiv
had
long
been
the
enemy
of
the
dutch
who
insulted
or
ridiculed
him
to
their
hearts
content
although
it
must
be
said
that
they
generally
used
french
refugees
for
the
mouthpiece
of
their
spite
their
national
pride
held
him
up
as
the
mithridates
of
the
republic
the
brothers
de
witt
therefore
had
to
strive
against
a
double
difficulty
against
the
force
of
national
antipathy
and
besides
against
the
feeling
of
weariness
which
is
natural
to
all
vanquished
people
when
they
hope
that
a
new
chief
will
be
able
to
save
them
from
ruin
and
shame
this
new
chief
quite
ready
to
appear
on
the
political
stage
and
to
measure
himself
against
louis
however
gigantic
the
fortunes
of
the
grand
monarch
loomed
in
the
future
was
william
prince
of
orange
son
of
william
and
grandson
by
his
mother
henrietta
stuart
of
charles
of
england
we
have
mentioned
him
before
as
the
person
by
whom
the
people
expected
to
see
the
office
of
stadtholder
restored
this
young
man
was
in
years
of
age
john
de
witt
who
was
his
tutor
had
brought
him
up
with
the
view
of
making
him
a
good
citizen
loving
his
country
better
than
he
did
his
disciple
the
master
had
by
the
perpetual
edict
extinguished
the
hope
which
the
young
prince
might
have
entertained
of
one
day
becoming
stadtholder
but
god
laughs
at
the
presumption
of
man
who
wants
to
raise
and
prostrate
the
powers
on
earth
without
consulting
the
king
above
and
the
fickleness
and
caprice
of
the
dutch
combined
with
the
terror
inspired
by
louis
in
repealing
the
perpetual
edict
and
the
office
of
stadtholder
in
favour
of
william
of
orange
for
whom
the
hand
of
providence
had
traced
out
ulterior
destinies
on
the
hidden
map
of
the
future
the
grand
pensionary
bowed
before
the
will
of
his
fellow
citizens
cornelius
de
witt
however
was
more
obstinate
and
notwithstanding
all
the
threats
of
death
from
the
orangist
rabble
who
besieged
him
in
his
house
at
dort
he
stoutly
refused
to
sign
the
act
by
which
the
office
of
stadtholder
was
restored
moved
by
the
tears
and
entreaties
of
his
wife
he
at
last
complied
only
adding
to
his
signature
the
two
letters
vi
coactus
notifying
thereby
that
he
only
yielded
to
force
it
was
a
real
miracle
that
on
that
day
he
escaped
from
the
doom
intended
for
him
john
de
witt
derived
no
advantage
from
his
ready
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
his
fellow
citizens
only
a
few
days
after
an
attempt
was
made
to
stab
him
in
which
he
was
severely
although
not
mortally
wounded
this
by
no
means
suited
the
views
of
the
orange
faction
the
life
of
the
two
brothers
being
a
constant
obstacle
to
their
plans
they
changed
their
tactics
and
tried
to
obtain
by
calumny
what
they
had
not
been
able
to
effect
by
the
aid
of
the
poniard
how
rarely
does
it
happen
that
in
the
right
moment
a
great
man
is
found
to
head
the
execution
of
vast
and
noble
designs
and
for
that
reason
when
such
a
providential
concurrence
of
circumstances
does
occur
history
is
prompt
to
record
the
name
of
the
chosen
one
and
to
hold
him
up
to
the
admiration
of
posterity
but
when
satan
interposes
in
human
affairs
to
cast
a
shadow
upon
some
happy
existence
or
to
overthrow
a
kingdom
it
seldom
happens
that
he
does
not
find
at
his
side
some
miserable
tool
in
whose
ear
he
has
but
to
whisper
a
word
to
set
him
at
once
about
his
task
the
wretched
tool
who
was
at
hand
to
be
the
agent
of
this
dastardly
plot
was
one
tyckelaer
whom
we
have
already
mentioned
a
surgeon
by
profession
he
lodged
an
information
against
cornelius
de
witt
setting
forth
that
the
warden
who
as
he
had
shown
by
the
letters
added
to
his
signature
was
fuming
at
the
repeal
of
the
perpetual
edict
had
from
hatred
against
william
of
orange
hired
an
assassin
to
deliver
the
new
republic
of
its
new
stadtholder
and
he
tyckelaer
was
the
person
thus
chosen
but
that
horrified
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
act
which
he
was
asked
to
perpetrate
he
had
preferred
rather
to
reveal
the
crime
than
to
commit
it
this
disclosure
was
indeed
well
calculated
to
call
forth
a
furious
outbreak
among
the
orange
faction
the
attorney
general
caused
on
the
of
august
cornelius
de
witt
to
be
arrested
and
the
noble
brother
of
john
de
witt
had
like
the
vilest
criminal
to
undergo
in
one
of
the
apartments
of
the
town
prison
the
preparatory
degrees
of
torture
by
means
of
which
his
judges
expected
to
force
from
him
the
confession
of
his
alleged
plot
against
william
of
orange
but
cornelius
was
not
only
possessed
of
a
great
mind
but
also
of
a
great
heart
he
belonged
to
that
race
of
martyrs
who
indissolubly
wedded
to
their
political
convictions
as
their
ancestors
were
to
their
faith
are
able
to
smile
on
pain
while
being
stretched
on
the
rack
he
recited
with
a
firm
voice
and
scanning
the
lines
according
to
measure
the
first
strophe
of
the
justum
ac
tenacem
of
horace
and
making
no
confession
tired
not
only
the
strength
but
even
the
fanaticism
of
his
executioners
the
judges
notwithstanding
acquitted
tyckelaer
from
every
charge
at
the
same
time
sentencing
cornelius
to
be
deposed
from
all
his
offices
and
dignities
to
pay
all
the
costs
of
the
trial
and
to
be
banished
from
the
soil
of
the
republic
for
ever
this
judgment
against
not
only
an
innocent
but
also
a
great
man
was
indeed
some
gratification
to
the
passions
of
the
people
to
whose
interests
cornelius
de
witt
had
always
devoted
himself
but
as
we
shall
soon
see
it
was
not
enough
the
athenians
who
indeed
have
left
behind
them
a
pretty
tolerable
reputation
for
ingratitude
have
in
this
respect
to
yield
precedence
to
the
dutch
they
at
least
in
the
case
of
aristides
contented
themselves
with
banishing
him
john
de
witt
at
the
first
intimation
of
the
charge
brought
against
his
brother
had
resigned
his
office
of
grand
pensionary
he
too
received
a
noble
recompense
for
his
devotedness
to
the
best
interests
of
his
country
taking
with
him
into
the
retirement
of
private
life
the
hatred
of
a
host
of
enemies
and
the
fresh
scars
of
wounds
inflicted
by
assassins
only
too
often
the
sole
guerdon
obtained
by
honest
people
who
are
guilty
of
having
worked
for
their
country
and
of
having
forgotten
their
own
private
interests
in
the
meanwhile
william
of
orange
urged
on
the
course
of
events
by
every
means
in
his
power
eagerly
waiting
for
the
time
when
the
people
by
whom
he
was
idolised
should
have
made
of
the
bodies
of
the
brothers
the
two
steps
over
which
he
might
ascend
to
the
chair
of
stadtholder
thus
then
on
the
of
august
as
we
have
already
stated
in
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
the
whole
town
was
crowding
towards
the
buytenhof
to
witness
the
departure
of
cornelius
de
witt
from
prison
as
he
was
going
to
exile
and
to
see
what
traces
the
torture
of
the
rack
had
left
on
the
noble
frame
of
the
man
who
knew
his
horace
so
well
yet
all
this
multitude
was
not
crowding
to
the
buytenhof
with
the
innocent
view
of
merely
feasting
their
eyes
with
the
spectacle
there
were
many
who
went
there
to
play
an
active
part
in
it
and
to
take
upon
themselves
an
office
which
they
conceived
had
been
badly
filled
that
of
the
executioner
there
were
indeed
others
with
less
hostile
intentions
all
that
they
cared
for
was
the
spectacle
always
so
attractive
to
the
mob
whose
instinctive
pride
is
flattered
by
it
the
sight
of
greatness
hurled
down
into
the
dust
has
not
they
would
say
this
cornelius
de
witt
been
locked
up
and
broken
by
the
rack
shall
we
not
see
him
pale
streaming
with
blood
covered
with
shame
and
was
not
this
a
sweet
triumph
for
the
burghers
of
the
hague
whose
envy
even
beat
that
of
the
common
rabble
a
triumph
in
which
every
honest
citizen
and
townsman
might
be
expected
to
share
moreover
hinted
the
orange
agitators
interspersed
through
the
crowd
whom
they
hoped
to
manage
like
a
and
at
the
same
time
crushing
instrument
moreover
will
there
not
from
the
buytenhof
to
the
gate
of
the
town
a
nice
little
opportunity
present
itself
to
throw
some
handfuls
of
dirt
or
a
few
stones
at
this
cornelius
de
witt
who
not
only
conferred
the
dignity
of
stadtholder
on
the
prince
of
orange
merely
vi
coactus
but
who
also
intended
to
have
him
assassinated
besides
which
the
fierce
enemies
of
france
chimed
in
if
the
work
were
done
well
and
bravely
at
the
hague
cornelius
would
certainly
not
be
allowed
to
go
into
exile
where
he
will
renew
his
intrigues
with
france
and
live
with
his
big
scoundrel
of
a
brother
john
on
the
gold
of
the
marquis
de
being
in
such
a
temper
people
generally
will
run
rather
than
walk
which
was
the
reason
why
the
inhabitants
of
the
hague
were
hurrying
so
fast
towards
the
buytenhof
honest
tyckelaer
with
a
heart
full
of
spite
and
malice
and
with
no
particular
plan
settled
in
his
mind
was
one
of
the
foremost
being
paraded
about
by
the
orange
party
like
a
hero
of
probity
national
honour
and
christian
charity
this
daring
miscreant
detailed
with
all
the
embellishments
and
flourishes
suggested
by
his
base
mind
and
his
ruffianly
imagination
the
attempts
which
he
pretended
cornelius
de
witt
had
made
to
corrupt
him
the
sums
of
money
which
were
promised
and
all
the
diabolical
stratagems
planned
beforehand
to
smooth
for
him
tyckelaer
all
the
difficulties
in
the
path
of
murder
and
every
phase
of
his
speech
eagerly
listened
to
by
the
populace
called
forth
enthusiastic
cheers
for
the
prince
of
orange
and
groans
and
imprecations
of
blind
fury
against
the
brothers
de
witt
the
mob
even
began
to
vent
its
rage
by
inveighing
against
the
iniquitous
judges
who
had
allowed
such
a
detestable
criminal
as
the
villain
cornelius
to
get
off
so
cheaply
some
of
the
agitators
whispered
he
will
be
off
he
will
escape
from
us
others
replied
a
vessel
is
waiting
for
him
at
schevening
a
french
craft
tyckelaer
has
seen
honest
tyckelaer
hurrah
for
tyckelaer
the
mob
cried
in
chorus
and
let
us
not
forget
a
voice
exclaimed
from
the
crowd
that
at
the
same
time
with
cornelius
his
brother
john
who
is
as
rascally
a
traitor
as
himself
will
likewise
make
his
and
the
two
rogues
will
in
france
make
merry
with
our
money
with
the
money
for
our
vessels
our
arsenals
and
our
dockyards
which
they
have
sold
to
louis
well
then
don
t
let
us
allow
them
to
depart
advised
one
of
the
patriots
who
had
gained
the
start
of
the
others
forward
to
the
prison
to
the
prison
echoed
the
crowd
amid
these
cries
the
citizens
ran
along
faster
and
faster
cocking
their
muskets
brandishing
their
hatchets
and
looking
death
and
defiance
in
all
directions
no
violence
however
had
as
yet
been
committed
and
the
file
of
horsemen
who
were
guarding
the
approaches
of
the
buytenhof
remained
cool
unmoved
silent
much
more
threatening
in
their
impassibility
than
all
this
crowd
of
burghers
with
their
cries
their
agitation
and
their
threats
the
men
on
their
horses
indeed
stood
like
so
many
statues
under
the
eye
of
their
chief
count
tilly
the
captain
of
the
mounted
troops
of
the
hague
who
had
his
sword
drawn
but
held
it
with
its
point
downwards
in
a
line
with
the
straps
of
his
stirrup
this
troop
the
only
defence
of
the
prison
overawed
by
its
firm
attitude
not
only
the
disorderly
riotous
mass
of
the
populace
but
also
the
detachment
of
the
burgher
guard
which
being
placed
opposite
the
buytenhof
to
support
the
soldiers
in
keeping
order
gave
to
the
rioters
the
example
of
seditious
cries
shouting
hurrah
for
orange
down
with
the
traitors
the
presence
of
tilly
and
his
horsemen
indeed
exercised
a
salutary
check
on
these
civic
warriors
but
by
degrees
they
waxed
more
and
more
angry
by
their
own
shouts
and
as
they
were
not
able
to
understand
how
any
one
could
have
courage
without
showing
it
by
cries
they
attributed
the
silence
of
the
dragoons
to
pusillanimity
and
advanced
one
step
towards
the
prison
with
all
the
turbulent
mob
following
in
their
wake
in
this
moment
count
tilly
rode
forth
towards
them
merely
lifting
his
sword
and
contracting
his
brow
whilst
he
addressed
them
well
gentlemen
of
the
burgher
guard
what
are
you
advancing
for
and
what
do
you
wish
the
burghers
shook
their
muskets
repeating
their
cry
hurrah
for
orange
death
to
the
traitors
hurrah
for
orange
all
well
and
good
replied
tilly
although
i
certainly
am
more
partial
to
happy
faces
than
to
gloomy
ones
death
to
the
traitors
as
much
of
it
as
you
like
as
long
as
you
show
your
wishes
only
by
cries
but
as
to
putting
them
to
death
in
good
earnest
i
am
here
to
prevent
that
and
i
shall
prevent
then
turning
round
to
his
men
he
gave
the
word
of
command
soldiers
ready
the
troopers
obeyed
orders
with
a
precision
which
immediately
caused
the
burgher
guard
and
the
people
to
fall
back
in
a
degree
of
confusion
which
excited
the
smile
of
the
cavalry
officer
holloa
he
exclaimed
with
that
bantering
tone
which
is
peculiar
to
men
of
his
profession
be
easy
gentlemen
my
soldiers
will
not
fire
a
shot
but
on
the
other
hand
you
will
not
advance
by
one
step
towards
the
and
do
you
know
sir
that
we
have
muskets
roared
the
commandant
of
the
burghers
i
must
know
it
by
jove
you
have
made
them
glitter
enough
before
my
eyes
but
i
beg
you
to
observe
also
that
we
on
our
side
have
pistols
that
the
pistol
carries
admirably
to
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
and
that
you
are
only
from
death
to
the
traitors
cried
the
exasperated
burghers
go
along
with
you
growled
the
officer
you
always
cry
the
same
thing
over
again
it
is
very
with
this
he
took
his
post
at
the
head
of
his
troops
whilst
the
tumult
grew
fiercer
and
fiercer
about
the
buytenhof
and
yet
the
fuming
crowd
did
not
know
that
at
that
very
moment
when
they
were
tracking
the
scent
of
one
of
their
victims
the
other
as
if
hurrying
to
meet
his
fate
passed
at
a
distance
of
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
behind
the
groups
of
people
and
the
dragoons
to
betake
himself
to
the
buytenhof
john
de
witt
indeed
had
alighted
from
his
coach
with
his
servant
and
quietly
walked
across
the
courtyard
of
the
prison
mentioning
his
name
to
the
turnkey
who
however
knew
him
he
said
good
morning
gryphus
i
am
coming
to
take
away
my
brother
who
as
you
know
is
condemned
to
exile
and
to
carry
him
out
of
the
whereupon
the
jailer
a
sort
of
bear
trained
to
lock
and
unlock
the
gates
of
the
prison
had
greeted
him
and
admitted
him
into
the
building
the
doors
of
which
were
immediately
closed
again
ten
yards
farther
on
john
de
witt
met
a
lovely
young
girl
of
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
dressed
in
the
national
costume
of
the
frisian
women
who
with
pretty
demureness
dropped
a
curtesy
to
him
chucking
her
under
the
chin
he
said
to
her
good
morning
my
good
and
fair
rosa
how
is
my
brother
oh
mynheer
john
the
young
girl
replied
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
harm
which
has
been
done
to
him
that
s
all
over
but
what
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
i
am
afraid
of
the
harm
which
they
are
going
to
do
to
oh
yes
said
de
witt
you
mean
to
speak
of
the
people
down
below
don
t
you
do
you
hear
them
they
are
indeed
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
but
when
they
see
us
perhaps
they
will
grow
calmer
as
we
have
never
done
them
anything
but
that
s
unfortunately
no
reason
except
for
the
contrary
muttered
the
girl
as
on
an
imperative
sign
from
her
father
she
withdrew
indeed
child
what
you
say
is
only
too
then
in
pursuing
his
way
he
said
to
himself
here
is
a
damsel
who
very
likely
does
not
know
how
to
read
who
consequently
has
never
read
anything
and
yet
with
one
word
she
has
just
told
the
whole
history
of
the
and
with
the
same
calm
mien
but
more
melancholy
than
he
had
been
on
entering
the
prison
the
grand
pensionary
proceeded
towards
the
cell
of
his
brother
chapter
the
two
brothers
as
the
fair
rosa
with
foreboding
doubt
had
foretold
so
it
happened
whilst
john
de
witt
was
climbing
the
narrow
winding
stairs
which
led
to
the
prison
of
his
brother
cornelius
the
burghers
did
their
best
to
have
the
troop
of
tilly
which
was
in
their
way
removed
seeing
this
disposition
king
mob
who
fully
appreciated
the
laudable
intentions
of
his
own
beloved
militia
shouted
most
lustily
hurrah
for
the
burghers
as
to
count
tilly
who
was
as
prudent
as
he
was
firm
he
began
to
parley
with
the
burghers
under
the
protection
of
the
cocked
pistols
of
his
dragoons
explaining
to
the
valiant
townsmen
that
his
order
from
the
states
commanded
him
to
guard
the
prison
and
its
approaches
with
three
companies
wherefore
such
an
order
why
guard
the
prison
cried
the
orangists
stop
replied
the
count
there
you
at
once
ask
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
was
told
guard
the
prison
and
i
guard
it
you
gentlemen
who
are
almost
military
men
yourselves
you
are
aware
that
an
order
must
never
be
but
this
order
has
been
given
to
you
that
the
traitors
may
be
enabled
to
leave
the
very
possibly
as
the
traitors
are
condemned
to
exile
replied
tilly
but
who
has
given
this
order
the
states
to
be
sure
the
states
are
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
and
you
are
a
traitor
yourself
i
yes
well
as
to
that
let
us
understand
each
other
gentlemen
whom
should
i
betray
the
states
why
i
can
not
betray
them
whilst
being
in
their
pay
i
faithfully
obey
their
as
the
count
was
so
indisputably
in
the
right
that
it
was
impossible
to
argue
against
him
the
mob
answered
only
by
redoubled
clamour
and
horrible
threats
to
which
the
count
opposed
the
most
perfect
urbanity
gentlemen
he
said
uncock
your
muskets
one
of
them
may
go
off
by
accident
and
if
the
shot
chanced
to
wound
one
of
my
men
we
should
knock
over
a
couple
of
hundreds
of
yours
for
which
we
should
indeed
be
very
sorry
but
you
even
more
so
especially
as
such
a
thing
is
neither
contemplated
by
you
nor
by
if
you
did
that
cried
the
burghers
we
should
have
a
pop
at
you
of
course
you
would
but
suppose
you
killed
every
man
jack
of
us
those
whom
we
should
have
killed
would
not
for
all
that
be
less
then
leave
the
place
to
us
and
you
will
perform
the
part
of
a
good
first
of
all
said
the
count
i
am
not
a
citizen
but
an
officer
which
is
a
very
different
thing
and
secondly
i
am
not
a
hollander
but
a
frenchman
which
is
more
different
still
i
have
to
do
with
no
one
but
the
states
by
whom
i
am
paid
let
me
see
an
order
from
them
to
leave
the
place
to
you
and
i
shall
only
be
too
glad
to
wheel
off
in
an
instant
as
i
am
confoundedly
bored
yes
yes
cried
a
hundred
voices
the
din
of
which
was
immediately
swelled
by
five
hundred
others
let
us
march
to
the
let
us
go
and
see
the
deputies
come
along
come
along
that
s
it
tilly
muttered
between
his
teeth
as
he
saw
the
most
violent
among
the
crowd
turning
away
go
and
ask
for
a
meanness
at
the
and
you
will
see
whether
they
will
grant
it
go
my
fine
fellows
go
the
worthy
officer
relied
on
the
honour
of
the
magistrates
who
on
their
side
relied
on
his
honour
as
a
soldier
i
say
captain
the
first
lieutenant
whispered
into
the
ear
of
the
count
i
hope
the
deputies
will
give
these
madmen
a
flat
refusal
but
after
all
it
would
do
no
harm
if
they
would
send
us
some
in
the
meanwhile
john
de
witt
whom
we
left
climbing
the
stairs
after
the
conversation
with
the
jailer
gryphus
and
his
daughter
rosa
had
reached
the
door
of
the
cell
where
on
a
mattress
his
brother
cornelius
was
resting
after
having
undergone
the
preparatory
degrees
of
the
torture
the
sentence
of
banishment
having
been
pronounced
there
was
no
occasion
for
inflicting
the
torture
extraordinary
cornelius
was
stretched
on
his
couch
with
broken
wrists
and
crushed
fingers
he
had
not
confessed
a
crime
of
which
he
was
not
guilty
and
now
after
three
days
of
agony
he
once
more
breathed
freely
on
being
informed
that
the
judges
from
whom
he
had
expected
death
were
only
condemning
him
to
exile
endowed
with
an
iron
frame
and
a
stout
heart
how
would
he
have
disappointed
his
enemies
if
they
could
only
have
seen
in
the
dark
cell
of
the
buytenhof
his
pale
face
lit
up
by
the
smile
of
the
martyr
who
forgets
the
dross
of
this
earth
after
having
obtained
a
glimpse
of
the
bright
glory
of
heaven
the
warden
indeed
had
already
recovered
his
full
strength
much
more
owing
to
the
force
of
his
own
strong
will
than
to
actual
aid
and
he
was
calculating
how
long
the
formalities
of
the
law
would
still
detain
him
in
prison
this
was
just
at
the
very
moment
when
the
mingled
shouts
of
the
burgher
guard
and
of
the
mob
were
raging
against
the
two
brothers
and
threatening
captain
tilly
who
served
as
a
rampart
to
them
this
noise
which
roared
outside
of
the
walls
of
the
prison
as
the
surf
dashing
against
the
rocks
now
reached
the
ears
of
the
prisoner
but
threatening
as
it
sounded
cornelius
appeared
not
to
deem
it
worth
his
while
to
inquire
after
its
cause
nor
did
he
get
up
to
look
out
of
the
narrow
grated
window
which
gave
access
to
the
light
and
to
the
noise
of
the
world
without
he
was
so
absorbed
in
his
pain
that
it
had
almost
become
a
habit
with
him
he
felt
with
such
delight
the
bonds
which
connected
his
immortal
being
with
his
perishable
frame
gradually
loosening
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
spirit
freed
from
the
trammels
of
the
body
were
hovering
above
it
like
the
expiring
flame
which
rises
from
the
embers
he
also
thought
of
his
brother
and
whilst
the
latter
was
thus
vividly
present
to
his
mind
the
door
opened
and
john
entered
hurrying
to
the
bedside
of
the
prisoner
who
stretched
out
his
broken
limbs
and
his
hands
tied
up
in
bandages
towards
that
glorious
brother
whom
he
now
excelled
not
in
services
rendered
to
the
country
but
in
the
hatred
which
the
dutch
bore
him
john
tenderly
kissed
his
brother
on
the
forehead
and
put
his
sore
hands
gently
back
on
the
mattress
cornelius
my
poor
brother
you
are
suffering
great
pain
are
you
not
i
am
suffering
no
longer
since
i
see
you
my
oh
my
poor
dear
cornelius
i
feel
most
wretched
to
see
you
in
such
a
and
indeed
i
have
thought
more
of
you
than
of
myself
and
whilst
they
were
torturing
me
i
never
thought
of
uttering
a
complaint
except
once
to
say
poor
brother
but
now
that
you
are
here
let
us
forget
all
you
are
coming
to
take
me
away
are
you
not
i
i
am
quite
healed
help
me
to
get
up
and
you
shall
see
how
i
can
you
will
not
have
to
walk
far
as
i
have
my
coach
near
the
pond
behind
tilly
s
tilly
s
dragoons
what
are
they
near
the
pond
for
well
said
the
grand
pensionary
with
a
melancholy
smile
which
was
habitual
to
him
the
gentlemen
at
the
expect
that
the
people
at
the
hague
would
like
to
see
you
depart
and
there
is
some
apprehension
of
a
of
a
tumult
replied
cornelius
fixing
his
eyes
on
his
perplexed
brother
a
tumult
yes
oh
that
s
what
i
heard
just
now
said
the
prisoner
as
if
speaking
to
himself
then
turning
to
his
brother
he
continued
are
there
many
persons
down
before
the
yes
my
brother
there
but
then
to
come
here
to
me
well
how
is
it
that
they
have
allowed
you
to
pass
you
know
well
that
we
are
not
very
popular
cornelius
said
the
grand
pensionary
with
gloomy
bitterness
i
have
made
my
way
through
all
sorts
of
bystreets
and
you
hid
yourself
john
i
wished
to
reach
you
without
loss
of
time
and
i
did
what
people
will
do
in
politics
or
on
the
sea
when
the
wind
is
against
them
i
at
this
moment
the
noise
in
the
square
below
was
heard
to
roar
with
increasing
fury
tilly
was
parleying
with
the
burghers
well
well
said
cornelius
you
are
a
very
skilful
pilot
john
but
i
doubt
whether
you
will
as
safely
guide
your
brother
out
of
the
buytenhof
in
the
midst
of
this
gale
and
through
the
raging
surf
of
popular
hatred
as
you
did
the
fleet
of
van
tromp
past
the
shoals
of
the
scheldt
to
with
the
help
of
god
cornelius
we
ll
at
least
try
answered
john
but
first
of
all
a
word
with
speak
the
shouts
began
anew
hark
hark
continued
cornelius
how
angry
those
people
are
is
it
against
you
or
against
me
i
should
say
it
is
against
us
both
cornelius
i
told
you
my
dear
brother
that
the
orange
party
while
assailing
us
with
their
absurd
calumnies
have
also
made
it
a
reproach
against
us
that
we
have
negotiated
with
what
blockheads
they
are
but
indeed
they
reproach
us
with
and
yet
if
these
negotiations
had
been
successful
they
would
have
prevented
the
defeats
of
rees
orsay
wesel
and
rheinberg
the
rhine
would
not
have
been
crossed
and
holland
might
still
consider
herself
invincible
in
the
midst
of
her
marshes
and
all
this
is
quite
true
my
dear
cornelius
but
still
more
certain
it
is
that
if
at
this
moment
our
correspondence
with
the
marquis
de
louvois
were
discovered
skilful
pilot
as
i
am
i
should
not
be
able
to
save
the
frail
barque
which
is
to
carry
the
brothers
de
witt
and
their
fortunes
out
of
holland
that
correspondence
which
might
prove
to
honest
people
how
dearly
i
love
my
country
and
what
sacrifices
i
have
offered
to
make
for
its
liberty
and
glory
would
be
ruin
to
us
if
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
orange
party
i
hope
you
have
burned
the
letters
before
you
left
dort
to
join
me
at
the
my
dear
brother
cornelius
answered
your
correspondence
with
de
louvois
affords
ample
proof
of
your
having
been
of
late
the
greatest
most
generous
and
most
able
citizen
of
the
seven
united
provinces
i
rejoice
in
the
glory
of
my
country
and
particularly
do
i
rejoice
in
your
glory
john
i
have
taken
good
care
not
to
burn
that
then
we
are
lost
as
far
as
this
life
is
concerned
quietly
said
the
grand
pensionary
approaching
the
window
no
on
the
contrary
john
we
shall
at
the
same
time
save
our
lives
and
regain
our
but
what
have
you
done
with
these
letters
i
have
intrusted
them
to
the
care
of
cornelius
van
baerle
my
godson
whom
you
know
and
who
lives
at
poor
honest
van
baerle
who
knows
so
much
and
yet
thinks
of
nothing
but
of
flowers
and
of
god
who
made
them
you
have
intrusted
him
with
this
fatal
secret
it
will
be
his
ruin
poor
soul
his
ruin
yes
for
he
will
either
be
strong
or
he
will
be
weak
if
he
is
strong
he
will
when
he
hears
of
what
has
happened
to
us
boast
of
our
acquaintance
if
he
is
weak
he
will
be
afraid
on
account
of
his
connection
with
us
if
he
is
strong
he
will
betray
the
secret
by
his
boldness
if
he
is
weak
he
will
allow
it
to
be
forced
from
him
in
either
case
he
is
lost
and
so
are
we
let
us
therefore
fly
fly
as
long
as
there
is
still
cornelius
de
witt
raising
himself
on
his
couch
and
grasping
the
hand
of
his
brother
who
shuddered
at
the
touch
of
his
linen
bandages
replied
do
not
i
know
my
godson
have
not
i
been
enabled
to
read
every
thought
in
van
baerle
s
mind
and
every
sentiment
in
his
heart
you
ask
whether
he
is
strong
or
weak
he
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
that
is
not
now
the
question
the
principal
point
is
that
he
is
sure
not
to
divulge
the
secret
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
does
not
know
it
john
turned
round
in
surprise
you
must
know
my
dear
brother
that
i
have
been
trained
in
the
school
of
that
distinguished
politician
john
de
witt
and
i
repeat
to
you
that
van
baerle
is
not
aware
of
the
nature
and
importance
of
the
deposit
which
i
have
intrusted
to
quick
then
cried
john
as
there
is
still
time
let
us
convey
to
him
directions
to
burn
the
through
whom
through
my
servant
craeke
who
was
to
have
accompanied
us
on
horseback
and
who
has
entered
the
prison
with
me
to
assist
you
consider
well
before
having
those
precious
documents
burnt
john
i
consider
above
all
things
that
the
brothers
de
witt
must
necessarily
save
their
lives
to
be
able
to
save
their
character
if
we
are
dead
who
will
defend
us
who
will
have
fully
understood
our
intentions
you
expect
then
that
they
would
kill
us
if
those
papers
were
found
john
without
answering
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
square
whence
at
that
very
moment
fierce
shouts
and
savage
yells
made
themselves
heard
yes
yes
said
cornelius
i
hear
these
shouts
very
plainly
but
what
is
their
meaning
john
opened
the
window
death
to
the
traitors
howled
the
populace
do
you
hear
now
cornelius
to
the
traitors
that
means
us
said
the
prisoner
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
yes
it
means
us
repeated
john
where
is
craeke
at
the
door
of
your
cell
i
let
him
enter
john
opened
the
door
the
faithful
servant
was
waiting
on
the
threshold
come
in
craeke
and
mind
well
what
my
brother
will
tell
no
john
it
will
not
suffice
to
send
a
verbal
message
unfortunately
i
shall
be
obliged
to
and
why
that
because
van
baerle
will
neither
give
up
the
parcel
nor
burn
it
without
a
special
command
to
do
but
will
you
be
able
to
write
poor
old
fellow
john
asked
with
a
look
on
the
scorched
and
bruised
hands
of
the
unfortunate
sufferer
if
i
had
pen
and
ink
you
would
soon
see
said
cornelius
here
is
a
pencil
at
any
have
you
any
paper
for
they
have
left
me
here
take
this
bible
and
tear
out
the
very
well
that
will
but
your
writing
will
be
just
leave
me
alone
for
that
said
cornelius
the
executioners
have
indeed
pinched
me
badly
enough
but
my
hand
will
not
tremble
once
in
tracing
the
few
lines
which
are
and
really
cornelius
took
the
pencil
and
began
to
write
when
through
the
white
linen
bandages
drops
of
blood
oozed
out
which
the
pressure
of
the
fingers
against
the
pencil
squeezed
from
the
raw
flesh
a
cold
sweat
stood
on
the
brow
of
the
grand
pensionary
cornelius
wrote
my
dear
godson
burn
the
parcel
which
i
have
intrusted
to
you
burn
it
without
looking
at
it
and
without
opening
it
so
that
its
contents
may
for
ever
remain
unknown
to
yourself
secrets
of
this
description
are
death
to
those
with
whom
they
are
deposited
burn
it
and
you
will
have
saved
john
and
cornelius
de
witt
farewell
and
love
me
cornelius
de
witt
august
john
with
tears
in
his
eyes
wiped
off
a
drop
of
the
noble
blood
which
had
soiled
the
leaf
and
after
having
handed
the
despatch
to
craeke
with
a
last
direction
returned
to
cornelius
who
seemed
overcome
by
intense
pain
and
near
fainting
now
said
he
when
honest
craeke
sounds
his
coxswain
s
whistle
it
will
be
a
signal
of
his
being
clear
of
the
crowd
and
of
his
having
reached
the
other
side
of
the
pond
and
then
it
will
be
our
turn
to
five
minutes
had
not
elapsed
before
a
long
and
shrill
whistle
was
heard
through
the
din
and
noise
of
the
square
of
the
buytenhof
john
gratefully
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
now
said
he
let
us
off
chapter
the
pupil
of
john
de
witt
whilst
the
clamour
of
the
crowd
in
the
square
of
buytenhof
which
grew
more
and
more
menacing
against
the
two
brothers
determined
john
de
witt
to
hasten
the
departure
of
his
brother
cornelius
a
deputation
of
burghers
had
gone
to
the
to
demand
the
withdrawal
of
tilly
s
horse
it
was
not
far
from
the
buytenhof
to
hoogstraet
high
street
and
a
stranger
who
since
the
beginning
of
this
scene
had
watched
all
its
incidents
with
intense
interest
was
seen
to
wend
his
way
with
or
rather
in
the
wake
of
the
others
towards
the
to
hear
as
soon
as
possible
the
current
news
of
the
hour
this
stranger
was
a
very
young
man
of
scarcely
or
three
with
nothing
about
him
that
bespoke
any
great
energy
he
evidently
had
his
good
reasons
for
not
making
himself
known
as
he
hid
his
face
in
a
handkerchief
of
fine
frisian
linen
with
which
he
incessantly
wiped
his
brow
or
his
burning
lips
with
an
eye
keen
as
that
of
a
bird
of
prey
with
a
long
aquiline
nose
a
finely
cut
mouth
which
he
generally
kept
open
or
rather
which
was
gaping
like
the
edges
of
a
wound
this
man
would
have
presented
to
lavater
if
lavater
had
lived
at
that
time
a
subject
for
physiognomical
observations
which
at
the
first
blush
would
not
have
been
very
favourable
to
the
person
in
question
what
difference
is
there
between
the
figure
of
the
conqueror
and
that
of
the
pirate
said
the
ancients
the
difference
only
between
the
eagle
and
the
vulture
serenity
or
restlessness
and
indeed
the
sallow
physiognomy
the
thin
and
sickly
body
and
the
prowling
ways
of
the
stranger
were
the
very
type
of
a
suspecting
master
or
an
unquiet
thief
and
a
police
officer
would
certainly
have
decided
in
favour
of
the
latter
supposition
on
account
of
the
great
care
which
the
mysterious
person
evidently
took
to
hide
himself
he
was
plainly
dressed
and
apparently
unarmed
his
arm
was
lean
but
wiry
and
his
hands
dry
but
of
an
aristocratic
whiteness
and
delicacy
and
he
leaned
on
the
shoulder
of
an
officer
who
with
his
hand
on
his
sword
had
watched
the
scenes
in
the
buytenhof
with
eager
curiosity
very
natural
in
a
military
man
until
his
companion
drew
him
away
with
him
on
arriving
at
the
square
of
the
hoogstraet
the
man
with
the
sallow
face
pushed
the
other
behind
an
open
shutter
from
which
corner
he
himself
began
to
survey
the
balcony
of
the
at
the
savage
yells
of
the
mob
the
window
of
the
opened
and
a
man
came
forth
to
address
the
people
who
is
that
on
the
balcony
asked
the
young
man
glancing
at
the
orator
it
is
the
deputy
bowelt
replied
the
officer
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
do
you
know
anything
of
him
an
honest
man
at
least
i
believe
so
hearing
this
character
given
of
bowelt
the
young
man
showed
signs
of
such
a
strange
disappointment
and
evident
dissatisfaction
that
the
officer
could
not
but
remark
it
and
therefore
added
at
least
people
say
so
monseigneur
i
can
not
say
anything
about
it
myself
as
i
have
no
personal
acquaintance
with
mynheer
an
honest
man
repeated
he
who
was
addressed
as
monseigneur
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
is
an
honest
man
brave
homme
or
a
brave
one
homme
brave
ah
monseigneur
must
excuse
me
i
would
not
presume
to
draw
such
a
fine
distinction
in
the
case
of
a
man
whom
i
assure
your
highness
once
more
i
know
only
by
if
this
bowelt
is
an
honest
man
his
highness
continued
he
will
give
to
the
demand
of
these
furibund
petitioners
a
very
queer
the
nervous
quiver
of
his
hand
which
moved
on
the
shoulder
of
his
companion
as
the
fingers
of
a
player
on
the
keys
of
a
harpsichord
betrayed
his
burning
impatience
so
ill
concealed
at
certain
times
and
particularly
at
that
moment
under
the
icy
and
sombre
expression
of
his
face
the
chief
of
the
deputation
of
the
burghers
was
then
heard
addressing
an
interpellation
to
mynheer
bowelt
whom
he
requested
to
let
them
know
where
the
other
deputies
his
colleagues
were
gentlemen
bowelt
repeated
for
the
second
time
i
assure
you
that
in
this
moment
i
am
here
alone
with
mynheer
d
asperen
and
i
can
not
take
any
resolution
on
my
own
the
order
we
want
the
order
cried
several
thousand
voices
mynheer
bowelt
wished
to
speak
but
his
words
were
not
heard
and
he
was
only
seen
moving
his
arms
in
all
sorts
of
gestures
which
plainly
showed
that
he
felt
his
position
to
be
desperate
when
at
last
he
saw
that
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
he
turned
round
towards
the
open
window
and
called
mynheer
d
asperen
the
latter
gentleman
now
made
his
appearance
on
the
balcony
where
he
was
saluted
with
shouts
even
more
energetic
than
those
with
which
ten
minutes
before
his
colleague
had
been
received
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
undertaking
the
difficult
task
of
haranguing
the
mob
but
the
mob
preferred
forcing
the
guard
of
the
states
which
however
offered
no
resistance
to
the
sovereign
people
to
listening
to
the
speech
of
mynheer
d
asperen
now
then
the
young
man
coolly
remarked
whilst
the
crowd
was
rushing
into
the
principal
gate
of
the
it
seems
the
question
will
be
discussed
indoors
captain
come
along
and
let
us
hear
the
oh
monseigneur
monseigneur
take
care
of
what
among
these
deputies
there
are
many
who
have
had
dealings
with
you
and
it
would
be
sufficient
that
one
of
them
should
recognize
your
yes
that
i
might
be
charged
with
having
been
the
instigator
of
all
this
work
indeed
you
are
right
said
the
young
man
blushing
for
a
moment
from
regret
of
having
betrayed
so
much
eagerness
from
this
place
we
shall
see
them
return
with
or
without
the
order
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
dragoons
then
we
may
judge
which
is
greater
mynheer
bowelt
s
honesty
or
his
but
replied
the
officer
looking
with
astonishment
at
the
personage
whom
he
addressed
as
monseigneur
but
your
highness
surely
does
not
suppose
for
one
instant
that
the
deputies
will
order
tilly
s
horse
to
quit
their
post
why
not
the
young
man
quietly
retorted
because
doing
so
would
simply
be
signing
the
death
warrant
of
cornelius
and
john
de
we
shall
see
his
highness
replied
with
the
most
perfect
coolness
god
alone
knows
what
is
going
on
within
the
hearts
of
the
officer
looked
askance
at
the
impassible
figure
of
his
companion
and
grew
pale
he
was
an
honest
man
as
well
as
a
brave
one
from
the
spot
where
they
stood
his
highness
and
his
attendant
heard
the
tumult
and
the
heavy
tramp
of
the
crowd
on
the
staircase
of
the
the
noise
thereupon
sounded
through
the
windows
of
the
hall
on
the
balcony
of
which
mynheers
bowelt
and
d
asperen
had
presented
themselves
these
two
gentlemen
had
retired
into
the
building
very
likely
from
fear
of
being
forced
over
the
balustrade
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
after
this
fluctuating
shadows
in
tumultuous
confusion
were
seen
flitting
to
and
fro
across
the
windows
the
council
hall
was
filling
suddenly
the
noise
subsided
and
as
suddenly
again
it
rose
with
redoubled
intensity
and
at
last
reached
such
a
pitch
that
the
old
building
shook
to
the
very
roof
at
length
the
living
stream
poured
back
through
the
galleries
and
stairs
to
the
arched
gateway
from
which
it
was
seen
issuing
like
waters
from
a
spout
at
the
head
of
the
first
group
man
was
flying
rather
than
running
his
face
hideously
distorted
with
satanic
glee
this
man
was
the
surgeon
tyckelaer
we
have
it
we
have
it
he
cried
brandishing
a
paper
in
the
air
they
have
got
the
order
muttered
the
officer
in
amazement
well
then
his
highness
quietly
remarked
now
i
know
what
to
believe
with
regard
to
mynheer
bowelt
s
honesty
and
courage
he
has
neither
the
one
nor
the
then
looking
with
a
steady
glance
after
the
crowd
which
was
rushing
along
before
him
he
continued
let
us
now
go
to
the
buytenhof
captain
i
expect
we
shall
see
a
very
strange
sight
the
officer
bowed
and
without
making
any
reply
followed
in
the
steps
of
his
master
there
was
an
immense
crowd
in
the
square
and
about
the
neighbourhood
of
the
prison
but
the
dragoons
of
tilly
still
kept
it
in
check
with
the
same
success
and
with
the
same
firmness
it
was
not
long
before
the
count
heard
the
increasing
din
of
the
approaching
multitude
the
first
ranks
of
which
rushed
on
with
the
rapidity
of
a
cataract
at
the
same
time
he
observed
the
paper
which
was
waving
above
the
surface
of
clenched
fists
and
glittering
arms
halloa
he
said
rising
in
his
stirrups
and
touching
his
lieutenant
with
the
knob
of
his
sword
i
really
believe
those
rascals
have
got
the
dastardly
ruffians
they
are
cried
the
lieutenant
it
was
indeed
the
order
which
the
burgher
guard
received
with
a
roar
of
triumph
they
immediately
sallied
forth
with
lowered
arms
and
fierce
shouts
to
meet
count
tilly
s
dragoons
but
the
count
was
not
the
man
to
allow
them
to
approach
within
an
inconvenient
distance
stop
he
cried
stop
and
keep
off
from
my
horse
or
i
shall
give
the
word
of
command
to
here
is
the
order
a
hundred
insolent
voices
answered
at
once
he
took
it
in
amazement
cast
a
rapid
glance
on
it
and
said
quite
aloud
those
who
have
signed
this
order
are
the
real
murderers
of
cornelius
de
witt
i
would
rather
have
my
two
hands
cut
off
than
have
written
one
single
letter
of
this
infamous
and
pushing
back
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
the
man
who
wanted
to
take
it
from
him
he
added
wait
a
minute
papers
like
this
are
of
importance
and
are
to
be
saying
this
he
folded
up
the
document
and
carefully
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
then
turning
round
towards
his
troop
he
gave
the
word
of
command
tilly
s
dragoons
wheel
to
the
right
after
this
he
added
in
an
undertone
yet
loud
enough
for
his
words
to
be
not
altogether
lost
to
those
about
him
and
now
ye
butchers
do
your
work
a
savage
yell
in
which
all
the
keen
hatred
and
ferocious
triumph
rife
in
the
precincts
of
the
prison
simultaneously
burst
forth
and
accompanied
the
departure
of
the
dragoons
as
they
were
quietly
filing
off
the
count
tarried
behind
facing
to
the
last
the
infuriated
populace
which
advanced
at
the
same
rate
as
the
count
retired
john
de
witt
therefore
had
by
no
means
exaggerated
the
danger
when
assisting
his
brother
in
getting
up
he
hurried
his
departure
cornelius
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
pensionary
descended
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
courtyard
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
he
found
little
rosa
trembling
all
over
oh
mynheer
john
she
said
what
a
misfortune
what
is
it
my
child
asked
de
witt
they
say
that
they
are
gone
to
the
to
fetch
the
order
for
tilly
s
horse
to
you
do
not
say
so
replied
john
indeed
my
dear
child
if
the
dragoons
are
off
we
shall
be
in
a
very
sad
i
have
some
advice
to
give
you
rosa
said
trembling
even
more
violently
than
before
well
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
say
my
child
why
should
not
god
speak
by
your
mouth
now
then
mynheer
john
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
not
go
out
through
the
main
and
why
so
as
the
dragoons
of
tilly
are
still
at
their
post
yes
but
their
order
as
long
as
it
is
not
revoked
enjoins
them
to
stop
before
the
have
you
got
an
order
for
them
to
accompany
you
out
of
the
town
we
have
not
well
then
in
the
very
moment
when
you
have
passed
the
ranks
of
the
dragoons
you
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
but
the
burgher
guard
alas
the
burgher
guard
are
the
most
enraged
of
what
are
we
to
do
then
if
i
were
in
your
place
mynheer
john
the
young
girl
timidly
continued
i
should
leave
by
the
postern
which
leads
into
a
deserted
whilst
all
the
people
are
waiting
in
the
high
street
to
see
you
come
out
by
the
principal
entrance
from
there
i
should
try
to
reach
the
gate
by
which
you
intend
to
leave
the
but
my
brother
is
not
able
to
walk
said
john
i
shall
try
cornelius
said
with
an
expression
of
most
sublime
fortitude
but
have
you
not
got
your
carriage
asked
the
girl
the
carriage
is
down
near
the
great
not
so
she
replied
i
considered
your
coachman
to
be
a
faithful
man
and
i
told
him
to
wait
for
you
at
the
the
two
brothers
looked
first
at
each
other
and
then
at
rosa
with
a
glance
full
of
the
most
tender
gratitude
the
question
is
now
said
the
grand
pensionary
whether
gryphus
will
open
this
door
for
indeed
he
will
do
no
such
thing
said
rosa
well
and
how
then
i
have
foreseen
his
refusal
and
just
now
whilst
he
was
talking
from
the
window
of
the
porter
s
lodge
with
a
dragoon
i
took
away
the
key
from
his
and
you
have
got
it
here
it
is
mynheer
my
child
said
cornelius
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
in
exchange
for
the
service
you
are
rendering
us
but
the
bible
which
you
will
find
in
my
room
it
is
the
last
gift
of
an
honest
man
i
hope
it
will
bring
you
good
i
thank
you
master
cornelius
it
shall
never
leave
me
replied
rosa
and
then
with
a
sigh
she
said
to
herself
what
a
pity
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
read
the
shouts
and
cries
are
growing
louder
and
louder
said
john
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
come
along
gentlemen
said
the
girl
who
now
led
the
two
brothers
through
an
inner
lobby
to
the
back
of
the
prison
guided
by
her
they
descended
a
staircase
of
about
a
dozen
steps
traversed
a
small
courtyard
which
was
surrounded
by
castellated
walls
and
the
arched
door
having
been
opened
for
them
by
rosa
they
emerged
into
a
lonely
street
where
their
carriage
was
ready
to
receive
them
quick
quick
my
masters
do
you
hear
them
cried
the
coachman
in
a
deadly
fright
yet
after
having
made
cornelius
get
into
the
carriage
first
the
grand
pensionary
turned
round
towards
the
girl
to
whom
he
said
my
child
words
could
never
express
our
gratitude
god
will
reward
you
for
having
saved
the
lives
of
two
rosa
took
the
hand
which
john
de
witt
proffered
to
her
and
kissed
it
with
every
show
of
respect
go
for
heaven
s
sake
go
she
said
it
seems
they
are
going
to
force
the
john
de
witt
hastily
got
in
sat
himself
down
by
the
side
of
his
brother
and
fastening
the
apron
of
the
carriage
called
out
to
the
coachman
to
the
the
was
the
iron
gate
leading
to
the
harbor
of
schevening
in
which
a
small
vessel
was
waiting
for
the
two
brothers
the
carriage
drove
off
with
the
fugitives
at
the
full
speed
of
a
pair
of
spirited
flemish
horses
rosa
followed
them
with
her
eyes
until
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
upon
which
closing
the
door
after
her
she
went
back
and
threw
the
key
into
a
cell
the
noise
which
had
made
rosa
suppose
that
the
people
were
forcing
the
prison
door
was
indeed
owing
to
the
mob
battering
against
it
after
the
square
had
been
left
by
the
military
solid
as
the
gate
was
and
although
gryphus
to
do
him
justice
stoutly
enough
refused
to
open
it
yet
evidently
it
could
not
resist
much
longer
and
the
jailer
growing
very
pale
put
to
himself
the
question
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
open
the
door
than
to
allow
it
to
be
forced
when
he
felt
some
one
gently
pulling
his
coat
he
turned
round
and
saw
rosa
do
you
hear
these
madmen
he
said
i
hear
them
so
well
my
father
that
in
your
place
you
would
open
the
door
no
i
should
allow
it
to
be
but
they
will
kill
me
yes
if
they
see
how
shall
they
not
see
me
hide
where
in
the
secret
but
you
my
child
i
shall
get
into
it
with
you
we
shall
lock
the
door
and
when
they
have
left
the
prison
we
shall
again
come
forth
from
our
hiding
zounds
you
are
right
there
cried
gryphus
it
s
surprising
how
much
sense
there
is
in
such
a
little
head
then
as
the
gate
began
to
give
way
amidst
the
triumphant
shouts
of
the
mob
she
opened
a
little
and
said
come
along
come
along
but
our
prisoners
god
will
watch
over
them
and
i
shall
watch
over
gryphus
followed
his
daughter
and
the
closed
over
his
head
just
as
the
broken
gate
gave
admittance
to
the
populace
the
dungeon
where
rosa
had
induced
her
father
to
hide
himself
and
where
for
the
present
we
must
leave
the
two
offered
to
them
a
perfectly
safe
retreat
being
known
only
to
those
in
power
who
used
to
place
there
important
prisoners
of
state
to
guard
against
a
rescue
or
a
revolt
the
people
rushed
into
the
prison
with
the
cry
death
to
the
traitors
to
the
gallows
with
cornelius
de
witt
death
death
chapter
the
murderers
the
young
man
with
his
hat
slouched
over
his
eyes
still
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
officer
and
still
wiping
from
time
to
time
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
was
watching
in
a
corner
of
the
buytenhof
in
the
shade
of
the
overhanging
of
a
closed
shop
the
doings
of
the
infuriated
mob
a
spectacle
which
seemed
to
draw
near
its
catastrophe
indeed
said
he
to
the
officer
indeed
i
think
you
were
right
van
deken
the
order
which
the
deputies
have
signed
is
truly
the
of
master
cornelius
do
you
hear
these
people
they
certainly
bear
a
sad
grudge
to
the
two
de
in
truth
replied
the
officer
i
never
heard
such
they
seem
to
have
found
out
the
cell
of
the
man
look
look
is
not
that
the
window
of
the
cell
where
cornelius
was
locked
up
a
man
had
seized
with
both
hands
and
was
shaking
the
iron
bars
of
the
window
in
the
room
which
cornelius
had
left
only
ten
minutes
before
halloa
halloa
the
man
called
out
he
is
how
is
that
gone
asked
those
of
the
mob
who
had
not
been
able
to
get
into
the
prison
crowded
as
it
was
with
the
mass
of
intruders
gone
gone
repeated
the
man
in
a
rage
the
bird
has
what
does
this
man
say
asked
his
highness
growing
quite
pale
oh
monseigneur
he
says
a
thing
which
would
be
very
fortunate
if
it
should
turn
out
true
certainly
it
would
be
fortunate
if
it
were
true
said
the
young
man
unfortunately
it
can
not
be
however
look
said
the
officer
and
indeed
some
more
faces
furious
and
contorted
with
rage
showed
themselves
at
the
windows
crying
escaped
gone
they
have
helped
them
off
and
the
people
in
the
street
repeated
with
fearful
imprecations
escaped
gone
after
them
and
catch
them
monseigneur
it
seems
that
mynheer
cornelius
has
really
escaped
said
the
officer
yes
from
prison
perhaps
but
not
from
the
town
you
will
see
van
deken
that
the
poor
fellow
will
find
the
gate
closed
against
him
which
he
hoped
to
find
has
an
order
been
given
to
close
the
town
gates
monseigneur
no
at
least
i
do
not
think
so
who
could
have
given
such
an
order
indeed
but
what
makes
your
highness
suppose
there
are
fatalities
monseigneur
replied
in
an
offhand
manner
and
the
greatest
men
have
sometimes
fallen
victims
to
such
at
these
words
the
officer
felt
his
blood
run
cold
as
somehow
or
other
he
was
convinced
that
the
prisoner
was
lost
at
this
moment
the
roar
of
the
multitude
broke
forth
like
thunder
for
it
was
now
quite
certain
that
cornelius
de
witt
was
no
longer
in
the
prison
cornelius
and
john
after
driving
along
the
pond
had
taken
the
main
street
which
leads
to
the
giving
directions
to
the
coachman
to
slacken
his
pace
in
order
not
to
excite
any
suspicion
but
when
on
having
proceeded
down
that
street
the
man
felt
that
he
had
left
the
prison
and
death
behind
and
before
him
there
was
life
and
liberty
he
neglected
every
precaution
and
set
his
horses
off
at
a
gallop
all
at
once
he
stopped
what
is
the
matter
asked
john
putting
his
head
out
of
the
coach
window
oh
my
masters
cried
the
coachman
it
is
terror
choked
the
voice
of
the
honest
fellow
well
say
what
you
have
to
say
urged
the
grand
pensionary
the
gate
is
closed
that
s
what
it
how
is
this
it
is
not
usual
to
close
the
gate
by
just
look
john
de
witt
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
indeed
saw
that
the
man
was
right
never
mind
but
drive
on
said
john
i
have
with
me
the
order
for
the
commutation
of
the
punishment
the
will
let
us
the
carriage
moved
along
but
it
was
evident
that
the
driver
was
no
longer
urging
his
horses
with
the
same
degree
of
confidence
moreover
as
john
de
witt
put
his
head
out
of
the
carriage
window
he
was
seen
and
recognized
by
a
brewer
who
being
behind
his
companions
was
just
shutting
his
door
in
all
haste
to
join
them
at
the
buytenhof
he
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
ran
after
two
other
men
before
him
whom
he
overtook
about
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
and
told
them
what
he
had
seen
the
three
men
then
stopped
looking
after
the
carriage
being
however
not
yet
quite
sure
as
to
whom
it
contained
the
carriage
in
the
meanwhile
arrived
at
the
open
cried
the
coachman
open
echoed
the
gatekeeper
from
the
threshold
of
his
lodge
it
s
all
very
well
to
say
open
but
what
am
i
to
do
it
with
with
the
key
to
be
sure
said
the
coachman
with
the
key
oh
yes
but
if
you
have
not
got
it
how
is
that
have
not
you
got
the
key
asked
the
coachman
no
i
haven
what
has
become
of
it
well
they
have
taken
it
from
who
some
one
i
dare
say
who
had
a
mind
that
no
one
should
leave
the
my
good
man
said
the
grand
pensionary
putting
out
his
head
from
the
window
and
risking
all
for
gaining
all
my
good
man
it
is
for
me
john
de
witt
and
for
my
brother
cornelius
who
i
am
taking
away
into
oh
mynheer
de
witt
i
am
indeed
very
much
grieved
said
the
gatekeeper
rushing
towards
the
carriage
but
upon
my
sacred
word
the
key
has
been
taken
from
when
this
by
whom
by
a
pale
and
thin
young
man
of
about
and
wherefore
did
you
give
it
up
to
him
because
he
showed
me
an
order
signed
and
by
whom
by
the
gentlemen
of
the
well
then
said
cornelius
calmly
our
doom
seems
to
be
do
you
know
whether
the
same
precaution
has
been
taken
at
the
other
gates
i
do
now
then
said
john
to
the
coachman
god
commands
man
to
do
all
that
is
in
his
power
to
preserve
his
life
go
and
drive
to
another
and
whilst
the
servant
was
turning
round
the
vehicle
the
grand
pensionary
said
to
the
gatekeeper
take
our
thanks
for
your
good
intentions
the
will
must
count
for
the
deed
you
had
the
will
to
save
us
and
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
is
as
if
you
had
succeeded
in
doing
alas
said
the
gatekeeper
do
you
see
down
there
drive
at
a
gallop
through
that
group
john
called
out
to
the
coachman
and
take
the
street
on
the
left
it
is
our
only
the
group
which
john
alluded
to
had
for
its
nucleus
those
three
men
whom
we
left
looking
after
the
carriage
and
who
in
the
meanwhile
had
been
joined
by
seven
or
eight
others
these
evidently
meant
mischief
with
regard
to
the
carriage
when
they
saw
the
horses
galloping
down
upon
them
they
placed
themselves
across
the
street
brandishing
cudgels
in
their
hands
and
calling
out
stop
stop
the
coachman
on
his
side
lashed
his
horses
into
increased
speed
until
the
coach
and
the
men
encountered
the
brothers
de
witt
enclosed
within
the
body
of
the
carriage
were
not
able
to
see
anything
but
they
felt
a
severe
shock
occasioned
by
the
rearing
of
the
horses
the
whole
vehicle
for
a
moment
shook
and
stopped
but
immediately
after
passing
over
something
round
and
elastic
which
seemed
to
be
the
body
of
a
prostrate
man
set
off
again
amidst
a
volley
of
the
fiercest
oaths
alas
said
cornelius
i
am
afraid
we
have
hurt
some
gallop
gallop
called
john
but
notwithstanding
this
order
the
coachman
suddenly
came
to
a
stop
now
then
what
is
the
matter
again
asked
john
look
there
said
the
coachman
john
looked
the
whole
mass
of
the
populace
from
the
buytenhof
appeared
at
the
extremity
of
the
street
along
which
the
carriage
was
to
proceed
and
its
stream
moved
roaring
and
rapid
as
if
lashed
on
by
a
hurricane
stop
and
get
off
said
john
to
the
coachman
it
is
useless
to
go
any
farther
we
are
lost
here
they
are
here
they
are
five
hundred
voices
were
crying
at
the
same
time
yes
here
they
are
the
traitors
the
murderers
the
assassins
answered
the
men
who
were
running
after
the
carriage
to
the
people
who
were
coming
to
meet
it
the
former
carried
in
their
arms
the
bruised
body
of
one
of
their
companions
who
trying
to
seize
the
reins
of
the
horses
had
been
trodden
down
by
them
this
was
the
object
over
which
the
two
brothers
had
felt
their
carriage
pass
the
coachman
stopped
but
however
strongly
his
master
urged
him
he
refused
to
get
off
and
save
himself
in
an
instant
the
carriage
was
hemmed
in
between
those
who
followed
and
those
who
met
it
it
rose
above
the
mass
of
moving
heads
like
a
floating
island
but
in
another
instant
it
came
to
a
dead
stop
a
blacksmith
had
with
his
hammer
struck
down
one
of
the
horses
which
fell
in
the
traces
at
this
moment
the
shutter
of
a
window
opened
and
disclosed
the
sallow
face
and
the
dark
eyes
of
the
young
man
who
with
intense
interest
watched
the
scene
which
was
preparing
behind
him
appeared
the
head
of
the
officer
almost
as
pale
as
himself
good
heavens
monseigneur
what
is
going
on
there
whispered
the
officer
something
very
terrible
to
a
certainty
replied
the
other
don
t
you
see
monseigneur
they
are
dragging
the
grand
pensionary
from
the
carriage
they
strike
him
they
tear
him
to
pieces
indeed
these
people
must
certainly
be
prompted
by
a
most
violent
indignation
said
the
young
man
with
the
same
impassible
tone
which
he
had
preserved
all
along
and
here
is
cornelius
whom
they
now
likewise
drag
out
of
the
carriage
cornelius
who
is
already
quite
broken
and
mangled
by
the
torture
only
look
look
indeed
it
is
cornelius
and
no
the
officer
uttered
a
feeble
cry
and
turned
his
head
away
the
brother
of
the
grand
pensionary
before
having
set
foot
on
the
ground
whilst
still
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
carriage
was
struck
down
with
an
iron
bar
which
broke
his
skull
he
rose
once
more
but
immediately
fell
again
some
fellows
then
seized
him
by
the
feet
and
dragged
him
into
the
crowd
into
the
middle
of
which
one
might
have
followed
his
bloody
track
and
he
was
soon
closed
in
among
the
savage
yells
of
malignant
exultation
the
young
man
a
thing
which
would
have
been
thought
impossible
grew
even
paler
than
before
and
his
eyes
were
for
a
moment
veiled
behind
the
lids
the
officer
saw
this
sign
of
compassion
and
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
this
softened
tone
of
his
feelings
continued
come
come
monseigneur
for
here
they
are
also
going
to
murder
the
grand
but
the
young
man
had
already
opened
his
eyes
again
to
be
sure
he
said
these
people
are
really
implacable
it
does
no
one
good
to
offend
monseigneur
said
the
officer
may
not
one
save
this
poor
man
who
has
been
your
highness
s
instructor
if
there
be
any
means
name
it
and
if
i
should
perish
in
the
attempt
william
of
orange
for
he
it
was
knit
his
brows
in
a
very
forbidding
manner
restrained
the
glance
of
gloomy
malice
which
glistened
in
his
eye
and
answered
captain
van
deken
i
request
you
to
go
and
look
after
my
troops
that
they
may
be
armed
for
any
but
am
i
to
leave
your
highness
here
alone
in
the
presence
of
all
these
murderers
go
and
don
t
you
trouble
yourself
about
me
more
than
i
do
myself
the
prince
gruffly
replied
the
officer
started
off
with
a
speed
which
was
much
less
owing
to
his
sense
of
military
obedience
than
to
his
pleasure
at
being
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
witnessing
the
shocking
spectacle
of
the
murder
of
the
other
brother
he
had
scarcely
left
the
room
when
john
who
with
an
almost
superhuman
effort
had
reached
the
stone
steps
of
a
house
nearly
opposite
that
where
his
former
pupil
concealed
himself
began
to
stagger
under
the
blows
which
were
inflicted
on
him
from
all
sides
calling
out
my
brother
where
is
my
brother
one
of
the
ruffians
knocked
off
his
hat
with
a
blow
of
his
clenched
fist
another
showed
to
him
his
bloody
hands
for
this
fellow
had
ripped
open
cornelius
and
disembowelled
him
and
was
now
hastening
to
the
spot
in
order
not
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
serving
the
grand
pensionary
in
the
same
manner
whilst
they
were
dragging
the
dead
body
of
cornelius
to
the
gibbet
john
uttered
a
cry
of
agony
and
grief
and
put
one
of
his
hands
before
his
eyes
oh
you
close
your
eyes
do
you
said
one
of
the
soldiers
of
the
burgher
guard
well
i
shall
open
them
for
and
saying
this
he
stabbed
him
with
his
pike
in
the
face
and
the
blood
spurted
forth
my
brother
cried
john
de
witt
trying
to
see
through
the
stream
of
blood
which
blinded
him
what
had
become
of
cornelius
my
brother
my
brother
go
and
run
after
him
bellowed
another
murderer
putting
his
musket
to
his
temples
and
pulling
the
trigger
but
the
gun
did
not
go
off
the
fellow
then
turned
his
musket
round
and
taking
it
by
the
barrel
with
both
hands
struck
john
de
witt
down
with
the
john
staggered
and
fell
down
at
his
feet
but
raising
himself
with
a
last
effort
he
once
more
called
out
my
brother
with
a
voice
so
full
of
anguish
that
the
young
man
opposite
closed
the
shutter
there
remained
little
more
to
see
a
third
murderer
fired
a
pistol
with
the
muzzle
to
his
face
and
this
time
the
shot
took
effect
blowing
out
his
brains
john
de
witt
fell
to
rise
no
more
on
this
every
one
of
the
miscreants
emboldened
by
his
fall
wanted
to
fire
his
gun
at
him
or
strike
him
with
blows
of
the
or
stab
him
with
a
knife
or
swords
every
one
wanted
to
draw
a
drop
of
blood
from
the
fallen
hero
and
tear
off
a
shred
from
his
garments
and
after
having
mangled
and
torn
and
completely
stripped
the
two
brothers
the
mob
dragged
their
naked
and
bloody
bodies
to
an
extemporised
gibbet
where
amateur
executioners
hung
them
up
by
the
feet
then
came
the
most
dastardly
scoundrels
of
all
who
not
having
dared
to
strike
the
living
flesh
cut
the
dead
in
pieces
and
then
went
about
the
town
selling
small
slices
of
the
bodies
of
john
and
cornelius
at
ten
sous
a
piece
we
can
not
take
upon
ourselves
to
say
whether
through
the
almost
imperceptible
chink
of
the
shutter
the
young
man
witnessed
the
conclusion
of
this
shocking
scene
but
at
the
very
moment
when
they
were
hanging
the
two
martyrs
on
the
gibbet
he
passed
through
the
terrible
mob
which
was
too
much
absorbed
in
the
task
so
grateful
to
its
taste
to
take
any
notice
of
him
and
thus
he
reached
unobserved
the
which
was
still
closed
ah
sir
said
the
gatekeeper
do
you
bring
me
the
key
yes
my
man
here
it
it
is
most
unfortunate
that
you
did
not
bring
me
that
key
only
one
quarter
of
an
hour
sooner
said
the
gatekeeper
with
a
sigh
and
why
that
asked
the
other
because
i
might
have
opened
the
gate
to
mynheers
de
witt
whereas
finding
the
gate
locked
they
were
obliged
to
retrace
their
gate
gate
cried
a
voice
which
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
man
in
a
hurry
the
prince
turning
round
observed
captain
van
deken
is
that
you
captain
he
said
you
are
not
yet
out
of
the
hague
this
is
executing
my
orders
very
monseigneur
replied
the
captain
this
is
the
third
gate
at
which
i
have
presented
myself
the
other
two
were
well
this
good
man
will
open
this
one
for
you
do
it
my
the
last
words
were
addressed
to
the
gatekeeper
who
stood
quite
thunderstruck
on
hearing
captain
van
deken
addressing
by
the
title
of
monseigneur
this
pale
young
man
to
whom
he
himself
had
spoken
in
such
a
familiar
way
as
it
were
to
make
up
for
his
fault
he
hastened
to
open
the
gate
which
swung
creaking
on
its
hinges
will
monseigneur
avail
himself
of
my
horse
asked
the
captain
i
thank
you
captain
i
shall
use
my
own
steed
which
is
waiting
for
me
close
at
and
taking
from
his
pocket
a
golden
whistle
such
as
was
generally
used
at
that
time
for
summoning
the
servants
he
sounded
it
with
a
shrill
and
prolonged
call
on
which
an
equerry
on
horseback
speedily
made
his
appearance
leading
another
horse
by
the
bridle
william
without
touching
the
stirrup
vaulted
into
the
saddle
of
the
led
horse
and
setting
his
spurs
into
its
flanks
started
off
for
the
leyden
road
having
reached
it
he
turned
round
and
beckoned
to
the
captain
who
was
far
behind
to
ride
by
his
side
do
you
know
he
then
said
without
stopping
that
those
rascals
have
killed
john
de
witt
as
well
as
his
brother
alas
monseigneur
the
captain
answered
sadly
i
should
like
it
much
better
if
these
two
difficulties
were
still
in
your
highness
s
way
of
becoming
de
facto
stadtholder
of
certainly
it
would
have
been
better
said
william
if
what
did
happen
had
not
happened
but
it
can
not
be
helped
now
and
we
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
let
us
push
on
captain
that
we
may
arrive
at
alphen
before
the
message
which
the
are
sure
to
send
to
me
to
the
the
captain
bowed
allowed
the
prince
to
ride
ahead
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
kept
at
the
same
respectful
distance
as
he
had
done
before
his
highness
called
him
to
his
side
how
i
should
wish
william
of
orange
malignantly
muttered
to
himself
with
a
dark
frown
and
setting
the
spurs
to
his
horse
to
see
the
figure
which
louis
will
cut
when
he
is
apprised
of
the
manner
in
which
his
dear
friends
de
witt
have
been
served
oh
thou
sun
thou
sun
as
truly
as
i
am
called
william
the
silent
thou
sun
thou
hadst
best
look
to
thy
rays
and
the
young
prince
the
relentless
rival
of
the
great
king
sped
away
upon
his
fiery
steed
this
future
stadtholder
who
had
been
but
the
day
before
very
uncertainly
established
in
his
new
power
but
for
whom
the
burghers
of
the
hague
had
built
a
staircase
with
the
bodies
of
john
and
cornelius
two
princes
as
noble
as
he
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
man
chapter
the
and
his
neighbour
whilst
the
burghers
of
the
hague
were
tearing
in
pieces
the
bodies
of
john
and
cornelius
de
witt
and
whilst
william
of
orange
after
having
made
sure
that
his
two
antagonists
were
really
dead
was
galloping
over
the
leyden
road
followed
by
captain
van
deken
whom
he
found
a
little
too
compassionate
to
honour
him
any
longer
with
his
confidence
craeke
the
faithful
servant
mounted
on
a
good
horse
and
little
suspecting
what
terrible
events
had
taken
place
since
his
departure
proceeded
along
the
high
road
lined
with
trees
until
he
was
clear
of
the
town
and
the
neighbouring
villages
being
once
safe
he
left
his
horse
at
a
livery
stable
in
order
not
to
arouse
suspicion
and
tranquilly
continued
his
journey
on
the
which
conveyed
him
by
easy
stages
to
dort
pursuing
their
way
under
skilful
guidance
by
the
shortest
possible
routes
through
the
windings
of
the
river
which
held
in
its
watery
embrace
so
many
enchanting
little
islands
edged
with
willows
and
rushes
and
abounding
in
luxurious
vegetation
whereon
flocks
of
fat
sheep
browsed
in
peaceful
sleepiness
craeke
from
afar
off
recognised
dort
the
smiling
city
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
dotted
with
windmills
he
saw
the
fine
red
brick
houses
mortared
in
white
lines
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
water
and
their
balconies
open
towards
the
river
decked
out
with
silk
tapestry
embroidered
with
gold
flowers
the
wonderful
manufacture
of
india
and
china
and
near
these
brilliant
stuffs
large
lines
set
to
catch
the
voracious
eels
which
are
attracted
towards
the
houses
by
the
garbage
thrown
every
day
from
the
kitchens
into
the
river
craeke
standing
on
the
deck
of
the
boat
saw
across
the
moving
sails
of
the
windmills
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
the
red
and
pink
house
which
was
the
goal
of
his
errand
the
outlines
of
its
roof
were
merging
in
the
yellow
foliage
of
a
curtain
of
poplar
trees
the
whole
habitation
having
for
background
a
dark
grove
of
gigantic
elms
the
mansion
was
situated
in
such
a
way
that
the
sun
falling
on
it
as
into
a
funnel
dried
up
warmed
and
fertilised
the
mist
which
the
verdant
screen
could
not
prevent
the
river
wind
from
carrying
there
every
morning
and
evening
having
disembarked
unobserved
amid
the
usual
bustle
of
the
city
craeke
at
once
directed
his
steps
towards
the
house
which
we
have
just
described
and
which
white
trim
and
tidy
even
more
cleanly
scoured
and
more
carefully
waxed
in
the
hidden
corners
than
in
the
places
which
were
exposed
to
view
enclosed
a
truly
happy
mortal
this
happy
mortal
rara
avis
was
van
baerle
the
godson
of
cornelius
de
witt
he
had
inhabited
the
same
house
ever
since
his
childhood
for
it
was
the
house
in
which
his
father
and
grandfather
old
established
princely
merchants
of
the
princely
city
of
dort
were
born
mynheer
van
baerle
the
father
had
amassed
in
the
indian
trade
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
guilders
which
mynheer
van
baerle
the
son
at
the
death
of
his
dear
and
worthy
parents
found
still
quite
new
although
one
set
of
them
bore
the
date
of
coinage
of
and
the
other
that
of
a
fact
which
proved
that
they
were
guilders
of
van
baerle
the
father
and
of
van
baerle
the
grandfather
but
we
will
inform
the
reader
at
once
that
these
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
guilders
were
only
the
pocket
money
or
sort
of
purse
for
cornelius
van
baerle
the
hero
of
this
story
as
his
landed
property
in
the
province
yielded
him
an
income
of
about
ten
thousand
guilders
a
year
when
the
worthy
citizen
the
father
of
cornelius
passed
from
time
into
eternity
three
months
after
having
buried
his
wife
who
seemed
to
have
departed
first
to
smooth
for
him
the
path
of
death
as
she
had
smoothed
for
him
the
path
of
life
he
said
to
his
son
as
he
embraced
him
for
the
last
time
eat
drink
and
spend
your
money
if
you
wish
to
know
what
life
really
is
for
as
to
toiling
from
morn
to
evening
on
a
wooden
stool
or
a
leathern
chair
in
a
or
a
laboratory
that
certainly
is
not
living
your
time
to
die
will
also
come
and
if
you
are
not
then
so
fortunate
as
to
have
a
son
you
will
let
my
name
grow
extinct
and
my
guilders
which
no
one
has
ever
fingered
but
my
father
myself
and
the
coiner
will
have
the
surprise
of
passing
to
an
unknown
master
and
least
of
all
imitate
the
example
of
your
godfather
cornelius
de
witt
who
has
plunged
into
politics
the
most
ungrateful
of
all
careers
and
who
will
certainly
come
to
an
untimely
having
given
utterance
to
this
paternal
advice
the
worthy
mynheer
van
baerle
died
to
the
intense
grief
of
his
son
cornelius
who
cared
very
little
for
the
guilders
and
very
much
for
his
father
cornelius
then
remained
alone
in
his
large
house
in
vain
his
godfather
offered
to
him
a
place
in
the
public
service
in
vain
did
he
try
to
give
him
a
taste
for
glory
although
cornelius
to
gratify
his
godfather
did
embark
with
de
ruyter
upon
the
seven
provinces
the
flagship
of
a
fleet
of
one
hundred
and
sail
with
which
the
famous
admiral
set
out
to
contend
singlehanded
against
the
combined
forces
of
france
and
england
when
guided
by
the
pilot
leger
he
had
come
within
of
the
prince
with
the
duke
of
york
the
english
king
s
brother
aboard
upon
which
de
ruyter
his
mentor
made
so
sharp
and
well
directed
an
attack
that
the
duke
perceiving
that
his
vessel
would
soon
have
to
strike
made
the
best
of
his
way
aboard
the
saint
michael
when
he
had
seen
the
saint
michael
riddled
and
shattered
by
the
dutch
broadside
drift
out
of
the
line
when
he
had
witnessed
the
sinking
of
the
earl
of
sandwich
and
the
death
by
fire
or
drowning
of
four
hundred
sailors
when
he
realized
that
the
result
of
all
this
destruction
after
twenty
ships
had
been
blown
to
pieces
three
thousand
men
killed
and
five
thousand
injured
was
that
nothing
was
decided
that
both
sides
claimed
the
victory
that
the
fighting
would
soon
begin
again
and
that
just
one
more
name
that
of
southwold
bay
had
been
added
to
the
list
of
battles
when
he
had
estimated
how
much
time
is
lost
simply
in
shutting
his
eyes
and
ears
by
a
man
who
likes
to
use
his
reflective
powers
even
while
his
fellow
creatures
are
cannonading
one
another
cornelius
bade
farewell
to
de
ruyter
to
the
ruart
de
pulten
and
to
glory
kissed
the
knees
of
the
grand
pensionary
for
whom
he
entertained
the
deepest
veneration
and
retired
to
his
house
at
dort
rich
in
his
repose
his
years
an
iron
constitution
and
keen
perceptions
and
his
capital
of
more
than
four
hundred
thousands
of
florins
and
income
of
ten
thousand
convinced
that
a
man
is
always
endowed
by
heaven
with
too
much
for
his
own
happiness
and
just
enough
to
make
him
miserable
consequently
and
to
indulge
his
own
idea
of
happiness
cornelius
began
to
be
interested
in
the
study
of
plants
and
insects
collected
and
classified
the
flora
of
all
the
dutch
islands
arranged
the
whole
entomology
of
the
province
on
which
he
wrote
a
treatise
with
plates
drawn
by
his
own
hands
and
at
last
being
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
his
time
and
especially
with
his
money
which
went
on
accumulating
at
a
most
alarming
rate
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
select
for
himself
from
all
the
follies
of
his
country
and
of
his
age
one
of
the
most
elegant
and
expensive
he
became
a
it
was
the
time
when
the
dutch
and
the
portuguese
rivalling
each
other
in
this
branch
of
horticulture
had
begun
to
worship
that
flower
and
to
make
more
of
a
cult
of
it
than
ever
naturalists
dared
to
make
of
the
human
race
for
fear
of
arousing
the
jealousy
of
god
soon
people
from
dort
to
mons
began
to
talk
of
mynheer
van
baerle
s
tulips
and
his
beds
pits
and
drawers
of
bulbs
were
visited
as
the
galleries
and
libraries
of
alexandria
were
by
illustrious
roman
travellers
van
baerle
began
by
expending
his
yearly
revenue
in
laying
the
groundwork
of
his
collection
after
which
he
broke
in
upon
his
new
guilders
to
bring
it
to
perfection
his
exertions
indeed
were
crowned
with
a
most
magnificent
result
he
produced
three
new
tulips
which
he
called
the
jane
after
his
mother
the
van
baerle
after
his
father
and
the
cornelius
after
his
godfather
the
other
names
have
escaped
us
but
the
fanciers
will
be
sure
to
find
them
in
the
catalogues
of
the
times
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
cornelius
de
witt
came
to
dort
for
three
months
to
live
at
his
old
family
mansion
for
not
only
was
he
born
in
that
city
but
his
family
had
been
resident
there
for
centuries
cornelius
at
that
period
as
william
of
orange
said
began
to
enjoy
the
most
perfect
unpopularity
to
his
fellow
citizens
the
good
burghers
of
dort
however
he
did
not
appear
in
the
light
of
a
criminal
who
deserved
to
be
hung
it
is
true
they
did
not
particularly
like
his
somewhat
austere
republicanism
but
they
were
proud
of
his
valour
and
when
he
made
his
entrance
into
their
town
the
cup
of
honour
was
offered
to
him
readily
enough
in
the
name
of
the
city
after
having
thanked
his
fellow
citizens
cornelius
proceeded
to
his
old
paternal
house
and
gave
directions
for
some
repairs
which
he
wished
to
have
executed
before
the
arrival
of
his
wife
and
children
and
thence
he
wended
his
way
to
the
house
of
his
godson
who
perhaps
was
the
only
person
in
dort
as
yet
unacquainted
with
the
presence
of
cornelius
in
the
town
in
the
same
degree
as
cornelius
de
witt
had
excited
the
hatred
of
the
people
by
sowing
those
evil
seeds
which
are
called
political
passions
van
baerle
had
gained
the
affections
of
his
fellow
citizens
by
completely
shunning
the
pursuit
of
politics
absorbed
as
he
was
in
the
peaceful
pursuit
of
cultivating
tulips
van
baerle
was
truly
beloved
by
his
servants
and
labourers
nor
had
he
any
conception
that
there
was
in
this
world
a
man
who
wished
ill
to
another
and
yet
it
must
be
said
to
the
disgrace
of
mankind
that
cornelius
van
baerle
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
had
a
much
more
ferocious
fierce
and
implacable
enemy
than
the
grand
pensionary
and
his
brother
had
among
the
orange
party
who
were
most
hostile
to
the
devoted
brothers
who
had
never
been
sundered
by
the
least
misunderstanding
during
their
lives
and
by
their
mutual
devotion
in
the
face
of
death
made
sure
the
existence
of
their
brotherly
affection
beyond
the
grave
at
the
time
when
cornelius
van
baerle
began
to
devote
himself
to
expending
on
this
hobby
his
yearly
revenue
and
the
guilders
of
his
father
there
was
at
dort
living
next
door
to
him
a
citizen
of
the
name
of
isaac
boxtel
who
from
the
age
when
he
was
able
to
think
for
himself
had
indulged
the
same
fancy
and
who
was
in
ecstasies
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
tulban
which
as
we
are
assured
by
the
floriste
francaise
the
most
highly
considered
authority
in
matters
relating
to
this
flower
is
the
first
word
in
the
cingalese
tongue
which
was
ever
used
to
designate
that
masterpiece
of
floriculture
which
is
now
called
the
tulip
boxtel
had
not
the
good
fortune
of
being
rich
like
van
baerle
he
had
therefore
with
great
care
and
patience
and
by
dint
of
strenuous
exertions
laid
out
near
his
house
at
dort
a
garden
fit
for
the
culture
of
his
cherished
flower
he
had
mixed
the
soil
according
to
the
most
approved
prescriptions
and
given
to
his
hotbeds
just
as
much
heat
and
fresh
air
as
the
strictest
rules
of
horticulture
exact
isaac
knew
the
temperature
of
his
frames
to
the
twentieth
part
of
a
degree
he
knew
the
strength
of
the
current
of
air
and
tempered
it
so
as
to
adapt
it
to
the
wave
of
the
stems
of
his
flowers
his
productions
also
began
to
meet
with
the
favour
of
the
public
they
were
beautiful
nay
distinguished
several
fanciers
had
come
to
see
boxtel
s
tulips
at
last
he
had
even
started
amongst
all
the
linnaeuses
and
tourneforts
a
tulip
which
bore
his
name
and
which
after
having
travelled
all
through
france
had
found
its
way
into
spain
and
penetrated
as
far
as
portugal
and
the
king
don
alfonso
who
being
expelled
from
lisbon
had
retired
to
the
island
of
terceira
where
he
amused
himself
not
like
the
great
condé
with
watering
his
carnations
but
with
growing
tulips
had
on
seeing
the
boxtel
tulip
exclaimed
not
so
bad
by
any
means
all
at
once
cornelius
van
baerle
who
after
all
his
learned
pursuits
had
been
seized
with
the
tulipomania
made
some
changes
in
his
house
at
dort
which
as
we
have
stated
was
next
door
to
that
of
boxtel
he
raised
a
certain
building
in
his
by
a
story
which
shutting
out
the
sun
took
half
a
degree
of
warmth
from
boxtel
s
garden
and
on
the
other
hand
added
half
a
degree
of
cold
in
winter
not
to
mention
that
it
cut
the
wind
and
disturbed
all
the
horticultural
calculations
and
arrangements
of
his
neighbour
after
all
this
mishap
appeared
to
boxtel
of
no
great
consequence
van
baerle
was
but
a
painter
a
sort
of
fool
who
tried
to
reproduce
and
disfigure
on
canvas
the
wonders
of
nature
the
painter
he
thought
had
raised
his
studio
by
a
story
to
get
better
light
and
thus
far
he
had
only
been
in
the
right
mynheer
van
baerle
was
a
painter
as
mynheer
boxtel
was
a
he
wanted
somewhat
more
sun
for
his
paintings
and
he
took
half
a
degree
from
his
neighbour
s
tulips
the
law
was
for
van
baerle
and
boxtel
had
to
abide
by
it
besides
isaac
had
made
the
discovery
that
too
much
sun
was
injurious
to
tulips
and
that
this
flower
grew
quicker
and
had
a
better
colouring
with
the
temperate
warmth
of
morning
than
with
the
powerful
heat
of
the
midday
sun
he
therefore
felt
almost
grateful
to
cornelius
van
baerle
for
having
given
him
a
screen
gratis
maybe
this
was
not
quite
in
accordance
with
the
true
state
of
things
in
general
and
of
isaac
boxtel
s
feelings
in
particular
it
is
certainly
astonishing
what
rich
comfort
great
minds
in
the
midst
of
momentous
catastrophes
will
derive
from
the
consolations
of
philosophy
but
alas
what
was
the
agony
of
the
unfortunate
boxtel
on
seeing
the
windows
of
the
new
story
set
out
with
bulbs
and
seedlings
of
tulips
for
the
border
and
tulips
in
pots
in
short
with
everything
pertaining
to
the
pursuits
of
a
there
were
bundles
of
labels
cupboards
and
drawers
with
compartments
and
wire
guards
for
the
cupboards
to
allow
free
access
to
the
air
whilst
keeping
out
slugs
mice
dormice
and
rats
all
of
them
very
curious
fanciers
of
tulips
at
two
thousand
francs
a
bulb
boxtel
was
quite
amazed
when
he
saw
all
this
apparatus
but
he
was
not
as
yet
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
his
misfortune
van
baerle
was
known
to
be
fond
of
everything
that
pleases
the
eye
he
studied
nature
in
all
her
aspects
for
the
benefit
of
his
paintings
which
were
as
minutely
finished
as
those
of
gerard
dow
his
master
and
of
mieris
his
friend
was
it
not
possible
that
having
to
paint
the
interior
of
a
s
he
had
collected
in
his
new
studio
all
the
accessories
of
decoration
yet
although
thus
consoling
himself
with
illusory
suppositions
boxtel
was
not
able
to
resist
the
burning
curiosity
which
was
devouring
him
in
the
evening
therefore
he
placed
a
ladder
against
the
partition
wall
between
their
gardens
and
looking
into
that
of
his
neighbour
van
baerle
he
convinced
himself
that
the
soil
of
a
large
square
bed
which
had
formerly
been
occupied
by
different
plants
was
removed
and
the
ground
disposed
in
beds
of
loam
mixed
with
river
mud
a
combination
which
is
particularly
favourable
to
the
tulip
and
the
whole
surrounded
by
a
border
of
turf
to
keep
the
soil
in
its
place
besides
this
sufficient
shade
to
temper
the
noonday
heat
aspect
water
in
abundant
supply
and
at
hand
in
short
every
requirement
to
insure
not
only
success
but
also
progress
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
that
van
baerle
had
become
a
boxtel
at
once
pictured
to
himself
this
learned
man
with
a
capital
of
four
hundred
thousand
and
a
yearly
income
of
ten
thousand
guilders
devoting
all
his
intellectual
and
financial
resources
to
the
cultivation
of
the
tulip
he
foresaw
his
neighbour
s
success
and
he
felt
such
a
pang
at
the
mere
idea
of
this
success
that
his
hands
dropped
powerless
his
knees
trembled
and
he
fell
in
despair
from
the
ladder
and
thus
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
painted
tulips
but
for
real
ones
that
van
baerle
took
from
him
half
a
degree
of
warmth
and
thus
van
baerle
was
to
have
the
most
admirably
fitted
aspect
and
besides
a
large
airy
and
well
ventilated
chamber
where
to
preserve
his
bulbs
and
seedlings
while
he
boxtel
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
for
this
purpose
his
bedroom
and
lest
his
sleeping
in
the
same
apartment
might
injure
his
bulbs
and
seedlings
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
a
miserable
garret
boxtel
then
was
to
have
next
door
to
him
a
rival
and
successful
competitor
and
his
rival
instead
of
being
some
unknown
obscure
gardener
was
the
godson
of
mynheer
cornelius
de
witt
that
is
to
say
a
celebrity
boxtel
as
the
reader
may
see
was
not
possessed
of
the
spirit
of
porus
who
on
being
conquered
by
alexander
consoled
himself
with
the
celebrity
of
his
conqueror
and
now
if
van
baerle
produced
a
new
tulip
and
named
it
the
john
de
witt
after
having
named
one
the
cornelius
it
was
indeed
enough
to
choke
one
with
rage
thus
boxtel
with
jealous
foreboding
became
the
prophet
of
his
own
misfortune
and
after
having
made
this
melancholy
discovery
he
passed
the
most
wretched
night
imaginable
chapter
the
hatred
of
a
from
that
moment
boxtel
s
interest
in
tulips
was
no
longer
a
stimulus
to
his
exertions
but
a
deadening
anxiety
henceforth
all
his
thoughts
ran
only
upon
the
injury
which
his
neighbour
would
cause
him
and
thus
his
favourite
occupation
was
changed
into
a
constant
source
of
misery
to
him
van
baerle
as
may
easily
be
imagined
had
no
sooner
begun
to
apply
his
natural
ingenuity
to
his
new
fancy
than
he
succeeded
in
growing
the
finest
tulips
indeed
he
knew
better
than
any
one
else
at
haarlem
or
leyden
the
two
towns
which
boast
the
best
soil
and
the
most
congenial
climate
how
to
vary
the
colours
to
modify
the
shape
and
to
produce
new
species
he
belonged
to
that
natural
humorous
school
who
took
for
their
motto
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
aphorism
uttered
by
one
of
their
number
in
to
despise
flowers
is
to
offend
from
that
premise
the
school
of
the
most
exclusive
of
all
schools
worked
out
the
following
syllogism
in
the
same
year
to
despise
flowers
is
to
offend
god
the
more
beautiful
the
flower
is
the
more
does
one
offend
god
in
despising
it
the
tulip
is
the
most
beautiful
of
all
flowers
therefore
he
who
despises
the
tulip
offends
god
beyond
by
reasoning
of
this
kind
it
can
be
seen
that
the
four
or
five
thousand
of
holland
france
and
portugal
leaving
out
those
of
ceylon
and
china
and
the
indies
might
if
so
disposed
put
the
whole
world
under
the
ban
and
condemn
as
schismatics
and
heretics
and
deserving
of
death
the
several
hundred
millions
of
mankind
whose
hopes
of
salvation
were
not
centred
upon
the
tulip
we
can
not
doubt
that
in
such
a
cause
boxtel
though
he
was
van
baerle
s
deadly
foe
would
have
marched
under
the
same
banner
with
him
mynheer
van
baerle
and
his
tulips
therefore
were
in
the
mouth
of
everybody
so
much
so
that
boxtel
s
name
disappeared
for
ever
from
the
list
of
the
notable
in
holland
and
those
of
dort
were
now
represented
by
cornelius
van
baerle
the
modest
and
inoffensive
savant
engaging
heart
and
soul
in
his
pursuits
of
sowing
planting
and
gathering
van
baerle
caressed
by
the
whole
fraternity
of
in
europe
entertained
nor
the
least
suspicion
that
there
was
at
his
very
door
a
pretender
whose
throne
he
had
usurped
he
went
on
in
his
career
and
consequently
in
his
triumphs
and
in
the
course
of
two
years
he
covered
his
borders
with
such
marvellous
productions
as
no
mortal
man
following
in
the
tracks
of
the
creator
except
perhaps
shakespeare
and
rubens
have
equalled
in
point
of
numbers
and
also
if
dante
had
wished
for
a
new
type
to
be
added
to
his
characters
of
the
inferno
he
might
have
chosen
boxtel
during
the
period
of
van
baerle
s
successes
whilst
cornelius
was
weeding
manuring
watering
his
beds
whilst
kneeling
on
the
turf
border
he
analysed
every
vein
of
the
flowering
tulips
and
meditated
on
the
modifications
which
might
be
effected
by
crosses
of
colour
or
otherwise
boxtel
concealed
behind
a
small
sycamore
which
he
had
trained
at
the
top
of
the
partition
wall
in
the
shape
of
a
fan
watched
with
his
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
and
with
foaming
mouth
every
step
and
every
gesture
of
his
neighbour
and
whenever
he
thought
he
saw
him
look
happy
or
descried
a
smile
on
his
lips
or
a
flash
of
contentment
glistening
in
his
eyes
he
poured
out
towards
him
such
a
volley
of
maledictions
and
furious
threats
as
to
make
it
indeed
a
matter
of
wonder
that
this
venomous
breath
of
envy
and
hatred
did
not
carry
a
blight
on
the
innocent
flowers
which
had
excited
it
when
the
evil
spirit
has
once
taken
hold
of
the
heart
of
man
it
urges
him
on
without
letting
him
stop
thus
boxtel
soon
was
no
longer
content
with
seeing
van
baerle
he
wanted
to
see
his
flowers
too
he
had
the
feelings
of
an
artist
the
of
a
rival
engrossed
his
interest
he
therefore
bought
a
telescope
which
enabled
him
to
watch
as
accurately
as
did
the
owner
himself
every
progressive
development
of
the
flower
from
the
moment
when
in
the
first
year
its
pale
begins
to
peep
from
the
ground
to
that
glorious
one
when
after
five
years
its
petals
at
last
reveal
the
hidden
treasures
of
its
chalice
how
often
had
the
miserable
jealous
man
to
observe
in
van
baerle
s
beds
tulips
which
dazzled
him
by
their
beauty
and
almost
choked
him
by
their
perfection
and
then
after
the
first
blush
of
the
admiration
which
he
could
not
help
feeling
he
began
to
be
tortured
by
the
pangs
of
envy
by
that
slow
fever
which
creeps
over
the
heart
and
changes
it
into
a
nest
of
vipers
each
devouring
the
other
and
ever
born
anew
how
often
did
boxtel
in
the
midst
of
tortures
which
no
pen
is
able
fully
to
describe
how
often
did
he
feel
an
inclination
to
jump
down
into
the
garden
during
the
night
to
destroy
the
plants
to
tear
the
bulbs
with
his
teeth
and
to
sacrifice
to
his
wrath
the
owner
himself
if
he
should
venture
to
stand
up
for
the
defence
of
his
tulips
but
to
kill
a
tulip
was
a
horrible
crime
in
the
eyes
of
a
genuine
as
to
killing
a
man
it
would
not
have
mattered
so
very
much
yet
van
baerle
made
such
progress
in
the
noble
science
of
growing
tulips
which
he
seemed
to
master
with
the
true
instinct
of
genius
that
boxtel
at
last
was
maddened
to
such
a
degree
as
to
think
of
throwing
stones
and
sticks
into
the
of
his
neighbour
but
remembering
that
he
would
be
sure
to
be
found
out
and
that
he
would
not
only
be
punished
by
law
but
also
dishonoured
for
ever
in
the
face
of
all
the
of
europe
he
had
recourse
to
stratagem
and
to
gratify
his
hatred
tried
to
devise
a
plan
by
means
of
which
he
might
gain
his
ends
without
being
compromised
himself
he
considered
a
long
time
and
at
last
his
meditations
were
crowned
with
success
one
evening
he
tied
two
cats
together
by
their
hind
legs
with
a
string
about
six
feet
in
length
and
threw
them
from
the
wall
into
the
midst
of
that
noble
that
princely
that
royal
bed
which
contained
not
only
the
cornelius
de
witt
but
also
the
beauty
of
brabant
edged
with
purple
and
pink
the
marble
of
rotterdam
colour
of
flax
blossoms
feathered
red
and
flesh
colour
the
wonder
of
haarlem
the
colombin
obscur
and
the
columbin
clair
the
frightened
cats
having
alighted
on
the
ground
first
tried
to
fly
each
in
a
different
direction
until
the
string
by
which
they
were
tied
together
was
tightly
stretched
across
the
bed
then
however
feeling
that
they
were
not
able
to
get
off
they
began
to
pull
to
and
fro
and
to
wheel
about
with
hideous
caterwaulings
mowing
down
with
their
string
the
flowers
among
which
they
were
struggling
until
after
a
furious
strife
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
string
broke
and
the
combatants
vanished
boxtel
hidden
behind
his
sycamore
could
not
see
anything
as
it
was
but
the
piercing
cries
of
the
cats
told
the
whole
tale
and
his
heart
overflowing
with
gall
now
throbbed
with
triumphant
joy
boxtel
was
so
eager
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
injury
that
he
remained
at
his
post
until
morning
to
feast
his
eyes
on
the
sad
state
in
which
the
two
cats
had
left
the
of
his
neighbour
the
mists
of
the
morning
chilled
his
frame
but
he
did
not
feel
the
cold
the
hope
of
revenge
keeping
his
blood
at
fever
heat
the
chagrin
of
his
rival
was
to
pay
for
all
the
inconvenience
which
he
incurred
himself
at
the
earliest
dawn
the
door
of
the
white
house
opened
and
van
baerle
made
his
appearance
approaching
the
with
the
smile
of
a
man
who
has
passed
the
night
comfortably
in
his
bed
and
has
had
happy
dreams
all
at
once
he
perceived
furrows
and
little
mounds
of
earth
on
the
beds
which
only
the
evening
before
had
been
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
all
at
once
he
perceived
the
symmetrical
rows
of
his
tulips
to
be
completely
disordered
like
the
pikes
of
a
battalion
in
the
midst
of
which
a
shell
has
fallen
he
ran
up
to
them
with
blanched
cheek
boxtel
trembled
with
joy
fifteen
or
twenty
tulips
torn
and
crushed
were
lying
about
some
of
them
bent
others
completely
broken
and
already
withering
the
sap
oozing
from
their
bleeding
bulbs
how
gladly
would
van
baerle
have
redeemed
that
precious
sap
with
his
own
blood
but
what
were
his
surprise
and
his
delight
what
was
the
disappointment
of
his
rival
not
one
of
the
four
tulips
which
the
latter
had
meant
to
destroy
was
injured
at
all
they
raised
proudly
their
noble
heads
above
the
corpses
of
their
slain
companions
this
was
enough
to
console
van
baerle
and
enough
to
fan
the
rage
of
the
horticultural
murderer
who
tore
his
hair
at
the
sight
of
the
effects
of
the
crime
which
he
had
committed
in
vain
van
baerle
could
not
imagine
the
cause
of
the
mishap
which
fortunately
was
of
far
less
consequence
than
it
might
have
been
on
making
inquiries
he
learned
that
the
whole
night
had
been
disturbed
by
terrible
caterwaulings
he
besides
found
traces
of
the
cats
their
footmarks
and
hairs
left
behind
on
the
to
guard
therefore
in
future
against
a
similar
outrage
he
gave
orders
that
henceforth
one
of
the
under
gardeners
should
sleep
in
the
garden
in
a
near
the
boxtel
heard
him
give
the
order
and
saw
the
put
up
that
very
day
but
he
deemed
himself
lucky
in
not
having
been
suspected
and
being
more
than
ever
incensed
against
the
successful
horticulturist
he
resolved
to
bide
his
time
just
then
the
tulip
society
of
haarlem
offered
a
prize
for
the
discovery
we
dare
not
say
the
manufacture
of
a
large
black
tulip
without
a
spot
of
colour
a
thing
which
had
not
yet
been
accomplished
and
was
considered
impossible
as
at
that
time
there
did
not
exist
a
flower
of
that
species
approaching
even
to
a
dark
nut
brown
it
was
therefore
generally
said
that
the
founders
of
the
prize
might
just
as
well
have
offered
two
millions
as
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
since
no
one
would
be
able
to
gain
it
the
world
however
was
thrown
by
it
into
a
state
of
most
active
commotion
some
fanciers
caught
at
the
idea
without
believing
it
practicable
but
such
is
the
power
of
imagination
among
florists
that
although
considering
the
undertaking
as
certain
to
fail
all
their
thoughts
were
engrossed
by
that
great
black
tulip
which
was
looked
upon
to
be
as
chimerical
as
the
black
swan
of
horace
or
the
white
raven
of
french
tradition
van
baerle
was
one
of
the
who
were
struck
with
the
idea
boxtel
thought
of
it
in
the
light
of
a
speculation
van
baerle
as
soon
as
the
idea
had
once
taken
root
in
his
clear
and
ingenious
mind
began
slowly
the
necessary
planting
and
to
reduce
the
tulips
which
he
had
grown
already
from
red
to
brown
and
from
brown
to
dark
brown
by
the
next
year
he
had
obtained
flowers
of
a
perfect
and
boxtel
espied
them
in
the
border
whereas
he
had
himself
as
yet
only
succeeded
in
producing
the
light
brown
it
might
perhaps
be
interesting
to
explain
to
the
gentle
reader
the
beautiful
chain
of
theories
which
go
to
prove
that
the
tulip
borrows
its
colors
from
the
elements
perhaps
we
should
give
him
pleasure
if
we
were
to
maintain
and
establish
that
nothing
is
impossible
for
a
florist
who
avails
himself
with
judgment
and
discretion
and
patience
of
the
sun
s
heat
the
clear
water
the
juices
of
the
earth
and
the
cool
breezes
but
this
is
not
a
treatise
upon
tulips
in
general
it
is
the
story
of
one
particular
tulip
which
we
have
undertaken
to
write
and
to
that
we
limit
ourselves
however
alluring
the
subject
which
is
so
closely
allied
to
ours
boxtel
once
more
worsted
by
the
superiority
of
his
hated
rival
was
now
completely
disgusted
with
and
being
driven
half
mad
devoted
himself
entirely
to
observation
the
house
of
his
rival
was
quite
open
to
view
a
garden
exposed
to
the
sun
cabinets
with
glass
walls
shelves
cupboards
boxes
and
ticketed
which
could
easily
be
surveyed
by
the
telescope
boxtel
allowed
his
bulbs
to
rot
in
the
pits
his
seedlings
to
dry
up
in
their
cases
and
his
tulips
to
wither
in
the
borders
and
henceforward
occupied
himself
with
nothing
else
but
the
doings
at
van
baerle
s
he
breathed
through
the
stalks
of
van
baerle
s
tulips
quenched
his
thirst
with
the
water
he
sprinkled
upon
them
and
feasted
on
the
fine
soft
earth
which
his
neighbour
scattered
upon
his
cherished
bulbs
but
the
most
curious
part
of
the
operations
was
not
performed
in
the
garden
it
might
be
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
van
baerle
went
up
to
his
laboratory
into
the
glazed
cabinet
whither
boxtel
s
telescope
had
such
an
easy
access
and
here
as
soon
as
the
lamp
illuminated
the
walls
and
windows
boxtel
saw
the
inventive
genius
of
his
rival
at
work
he
beheld
him
sifting
his
seeds
and
soaking
them
in
liquids
which
were
destined
to
modify
or
to
deepen
their
colours
he
knew
what
cornelius
meant
when
heating
certain
grains
then
moistening
them
then
combining
them
with
others
by
a
sort
of
grafting
a
minute
and
marvellously
delicate
manipulation
and
when
he
shut
up
in
darkness
those
which
were
expected
to
furnish
the
black
colour
exposed
to
the
sun
or
to
the
lamp
those
which
were
to
produce
red
and
placed
between
the
endless
reflections
of
two
those
intended
for
white
the
pure
representation
of
the
limpid
element
this
innocent
magic
the
fruit
at
the
same
time
of
musings
and
of
manly
genius
this
patient
untiring
labour
of
which
boxtel
knew
himself
to
be
incapable
made
him
gnawed
as
he
was
with
envy
centre
all
his
life
all
his
thoughts
and
all
his
hopes
in
his
telescope
for
strange
to
say
the
love
and
interest
of
horticulture
had
not
deadened
in
isaac
his
fierce
envy
and
thirst
of
revenge
sometimes
whilst
covering
van
baerle
with
his
telescope
he
deluded
himself
into
a
belief
that
he
was
levelling
a
musket
at
him
and
then
he
would
seek
with
his
finger
for
the
trigger
to
fire
the
shot
which
was
to
have
killed
his
neighbour
but
it
is
time
that
we
should
connect
with
this
epoch
of
the
operations
of
the
one
and
the
espionage
of
the
other
the
visit
which
cornelius
de
witt
came
to
pay
to
his
native
town
chapter
the
happy
man
makes
acquaintance
with
misfortune
cornelius
de
witt
after
having
attended
to
his
family
affairs
reached
the
house
of
his
godson
cornelius
van
baerle
one
evening
in
the
month
of
january
de
witt
although
being
very
little
of
a
horticulturist
or
of
an
artist
went
over
the
whole
mansion
from
the
studio
to
the
inspecting
everything
from
the
pictures
down
to
the
tulips
he
thanked
his
godson
for
having
joined
him
on
the
deck
of
the
admiral
s
ship
the
seven
provinces
during
the
battle
of
southwold
bay
and
for
having
given
his
name
to
a
magnificent
tulip
and
whilst
he
thus
with
the
kindness
and
affability
of
a
father
to
a
son
visited
van
baerle
s
treasures
the
crowd
gathered
with
curiosity
and
even
respect
before
the
door
of
the
happy
man
all
this
hubbub
excited
the
attention
of
boxtel
who
was
just
taking
his
meal
by
his
fireside
he
inquired
what
it
meant
and
on
being
informed
of
the
cause
of
all
this
stir
climbed
up
to
his
post
of
observation
where
in
spite
of
the
cold
he
took
his
stand
with
the
telescope
to
his
eye
this
telescope
had
not
been
of
great
service
to
him
since
the
autumn
of
the
tulips
like
true
daughters
of
the
east
averse
to
cold
do
not
abide
in
the
open
ground
in
winter
they
need
the
shelter
of
the
house
the
soft
bed
on
the
shelves
and
the
congenial
warmth
of
the
stove
van
baerle
therefore
passed
the
whole
winter
in
his
laboratory
in
the
midst
of
his
books
and
pictures
he
went
only
rarely
to
the
room
where
he
kept
his
bulbs
unless
it
were
to
allow
some
occasional
rays
of
the
sun
to
enter
by
opening
one
of
the
movable
sashes
of
the
glass
front
on
the
evening
of
which
we
are
speaking
after
the
two
corneliuses
had
visited
together
all
the
apartments
of
the
house
whilst
a
train
of
domestics
followed
their
steps
de
witt
said
in
a
low
voice
to
van
baerle
my
dear
son
send
these
people
away
and
let
us
be
alone
for
some
the
younger
cornelius
bowing
assent
said
aloud
would
you
now
sir
please
to
see
my
the
this
pantheon
this
sanctum
sanctorum
of
the
was
as
delphi
of
old
interdicted
to
the
profane
uninitiated
never
had
any
of
his
servants
been
bold
enough
to
set
his
foot
there
cornelius
admitted
only
the
inoffensive
broom
of
an
old
frisian
housekeeper
who
had
been
his
nurse
and
who
from
the
time
when
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
culture
of
tulips
ventured
no
longer
to
put
onions
in
his
stews
for
fear
of
pulling
to
pieces
and
mincing
the
idol
of
her
foster
child
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
therefore
the
servants
who
were
carrying
the
lights
respectfully
fell
back
cornelius
taking
the
candlestick
from
the
hands
of
the
foremost
conducted
his
godfather
into
that
room
which
was
no
other
than
that
very
cabinet
with
a
glass
front
into
which
boxtel
was
continually
prying
with
his
telescope
the
envious
spy
was
watching
more
intently
than
ever
first
of
all
he
saw
the
walls
and
windows
lit
up
then
two
dark
figures
appeared
one
of
them
tall
majestic
stern
sat
down
near
the
table
on
which
van
baerle
had
placed
the
taper
in
this
figure
boxtel
recognised
the
pale
features
of
cornelius
de
witt
whose
long
hair
parted
in
front
fell
over
his
shoulders
de
witt
after
having
said
some
few
words
to
cornelius
the
meaning
of
which
the
prying
neighbour
could
not
read
in
the
movement
of
his
lips
took
from
his
breast
pocket
a
white
parcel
carefully
sealed
which
boxtel
judging
from
the
manner
in
which
cornelius
received
it
and
placed
it
in
one
of
the
presses
supposed
to
contain
papers
of
the
greatest
importance
his
first
thought
was
that
this
precious
deposit
enclosed
some
newly
imported
bulbs
from
bengal
or
ceylon
but
he
soon
reflected
that
cornelius
de
witt
was
very
little
addicted
to
and
that
he
only
occupied
himself
with
the
affairs
of
man
a
pursuit
by
far
less
peaceful
and
agreeable
than
that
of
the
florist
he
therefore
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
parcel
contained
simply
some
papers
and
that
these
papers
were
relating
to
politics
but
why
should
papers
of
political
import
be
intrusted
to
van
baerle
who
not
only
was
but
also
boasted
of
being
an
entire
stranger
to
the
science
of
government
which
in
his
opinion
was
more
occult
than
alchemy
itself
it
was
undoubtedly
a
deposit
which
cornelius
de
witt
already
threatened
by
the
unpopularity
with
which
his
countrymen
were
going
to
honour
him
was
placing
in
the
hands
of
his
godson
a
contrivance
so
much
the
more
cleverly
devised
as
it
certainly
was
not
at
all
likely
that
it
should
be
searched
for
at
the
house
of
one
who
had
always
stood
aloof
from
every
sort
of
intrigue
and
besides
if
the
parcel
had
been
made
up
of
bulbs
boxtel
knew
his
neighbour
too
well
not
to
expect
that
van
baerle
would
not
have
lost
one
moment
in
satisfying
his
curiosity
and
feasting
his
eyes
on
the
present
which
he
had
received
but
on
the
contrary
cornelius
had
received
the
parcel
from
the
hands
of
his
godfather
with
every
mark
of
respect
and
put
it
by
with
the
same
respectful
manner
in
a
drawer
stowing
it
away
so
that
it
should
not
take
up
too
much
of
the
room
which
was
reserved
to
his
bulbs
the
parcel
thus
being
secreted
cornelius
de
witt
got
up
pressed
the
hand
of
his
godson
and
turned
towards
the
door
van
baerle
seizing
the
candlestick
and
lighting
him
on
his
way
down
to
the
street
which
was
still
crowded
with
people
who
wished
to
see
their
great
fellow
citizen
getting
into
his
coach
boxtel
had
not
been
mistaken
in
his
supposition
the
deposit
intrusted
to
van
baerle
and
carefully
locked
up
by
him
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
john
de
witt
s
correspondence
with
the
marquis
de
louvois
the
war
minister
of
the
king
of
france
only
the
godfather
forbore
giving
to
his
godson
the
least
intimation
concerning
the
political
importance
of
the
secret
merely
desiring
him
not
to
deliver
the
parcel
to
any
one
but
to
himself
or
to
whomsoever
he
should
send
to
claim
it
in
his
name
and
van
baerle
as
we
have
seen
locked
it
up
with
his
most
precious
bulbs
to
think
no
more
of
it
after
his
godfather
had
left
him
very
unlike
boxtel
who
looked
upon
this
parcel
as
a
clever
pilot
does
on
the
distant
and
scarcely
perceptible
cloud
which
is
increasing
on
its
way
and
which
is
fraught
with
a
storm
little
dreaming
of
the
jealous
hatred
of
his
neighbour
van
baerle
had
proceeded
step
by
step
towards
gaining
the
prize
offered
by
the
horticultural
society
of
haarlem
he
had
progressed
from
shade
to
that
of
roasted
coffee
and
on
the
very
day
when
the
frightful
events
took
place
at
the
hague
which
we
have
related
in
the
preceding
chapters
we
find
him
about
one
o
clock
in
the
day
gathering
from
the
border
the
young
suckers
raised
from
tulips
of
the
colour
of
roasted
coffee
and
which
being
expected
to
flower
for
the
first
time
in
the
spring
of
would
undoubtedly
produce
the
large
black
tulip
required
by
the
haarlem
society
on
the
of
august
at
one
o
clock
cornelius
was
therefore
in
his
with
his
feet
resting
on
the
of
the
table
and
his
elbows
on
the
cover
looking
with
intense
delight
on
three
suckers
which
he
had
just
detached
from
the
mother
bulb
pure
perfect
and
entire
and
from
which
was
to
grow
that
wonderful
produce
of
horticulture
which
would
render
the
name
of
cornelius
van
baerle
for
ever
illustrious
i
shall
find
the
black
tulip
said
cornelius
to
himself
whilst
detaching
the
suckers
i
shall
obtain
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
offered
by
the
society
i
shall
distribute
them
among
the
poor
of
dort
and
thus
the
hatred
which
every
rich
man
has
to
encounter
in
times
of
civil
wars
will
be
soothed
down
and
i
shall
be
able
without
fearing
any
harm
either
from
republicans
or
orangists
to
keep
as
heretofore
my
borders
in
splendid
condition
i
need
no
more
be
afraid
lest
on
the
day
of
a
riot
the
shopkeepers
of
the
town
and
the
sailors
of
the
port
should
come
and
tear
out
my
bulbs
to
boil
them
as
onions
for
their
families
as
they
have
sometimes
quietly
threatened
when
they
happened
to
remember
my
having
paid
two
or
three
hundred
guilders
for
one
bulb
it
is
therefore
settled
i
shall
give
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
of
the
haarlem
prize
to
the
poor
and
yet
here
cornelius
stopped
and
heaved
a
sigh
and
yet
he
continued
it
would
have
been
so
very
delightful
to
spend
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
on
the
enlargement
of
my
or
even
on
a
journey
to
the
east
the
country
of
beautiful
flowers
but
alas
these
are
no
thoughts
for
the
present
times
when
muskets
standards
proclamations
and
beating
of
drums
are
the
order
of
the
van
baerle
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
sighed
again
then
turning
his
glance
towards
his
bulbs
objects
of
much
greater
importance
to
him
than
all
those
muskets
standards
drums
and
proclamations
which
he
conceived
only
to
be
fit
to
disturb
the
minds
of
honest
people
he
said
these
are
indeed
beautiful
bulbs
how
smooth
they
are
how
well
formed
there
is
that
air
of
melancholy
about
them
which
promises
to
produce
a
flower
of
the
colour
of
ebony
on
their
skin
you
can
not
even
distinguish
the
circulating
veins
with
the
naked
eye
certainly
certainly
not
a
light
spot
will
disfigure
the
tulip
which
i
have
called
into
existence
and
by
what
name
shall
we
call
this
offspring
of
my
sleepless
nights
of
my
labour
and
my
thought
tulipa
nigra
barlœnsis
yes
barlœnsis
a
fine
name
all
the
that
is
to
say
all
the
intelligent
people
of
europe
will
feel
a
thrill
of
excitement
when
the
rumour
spreads
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
the
grand
black
tulip
is
found
how
is
it
called
the
fanciers
will
tulipa
nigra
barlœnsis
why
barlœnsis
after
its
grower
van
baerle
will
be
the
and
who
is
this
van
baerle
it
is
the
same
who
has
already
produced
five
new
tulips
the
jane
the
john
de
witt
the
cornelius
de
witt
well
that
is
what
i
call
my
ambition
it
will
cause
tears
to
no
one
and
people
will
talk
of
my
tulipa
nigra
barlœnsis
when
perhaps
my
godfather
this
sublime
politician
is
only
known
from
the
tulip
to
which
i
have
given
his
name
oh
these
darling
bulbs
when
my
tulip
has
flowered
baerle
continued
in
his
soliloquy
and
when
tranquillity
is
restored
in
holland
i
shall
give
to
the
poor
only
fifty
thousand
guilders
which
after
all
is
a
goodly
sum
for
a
man
who
is
under
no
obligation
whatever
then
with
the
remaining
fifty
thousand
guilders
i
shall
make
experiments
with
them
i
shall
succeed
in
imparting
scent
to
the
tulip
ah
if
i
succeed
in
giving
it
the
odour
of
the
rose
or
the
carnation
or
what
would
be
still
better
a
completely
new
scent
if
i
restored
to
this
queen
of
flowers
its
natural
distinctive
perfume
which
she
has
lost
in
passing
from
her
eastern
to
her
european
throne
and
which
she
must
have
in
the
indian
peninsula
at
goa
bombay
and
madras
and
especially
in
that
island
which
in
olden
times
as
is
asserted
was
the
terrestrial
paradise
and
which
is
called
ceylon
oh
what
glory
i
must
say
i
would
then
rather
be
cornelius
van
baerle
than
alexander
cæsar
or
maximilian
oh
the
admirable
bulbs
thus
cornelius
indulged
in
the
delights
of
contemplation
and
was
carried
away
by
the
sweetest
dreams
suddenly
the
bell
of
his
cabinet
was
rung
much
more
violently
than
usual
cornelius
startled
laid
his
hands
on
his
bulbs
and
turned
round
who
is
here
he
asked
sir
answered
the
servant
it
is
a
messenger
from
the
a
messenger
from
the
hague
what
does
he
want
sir
it
is
craeke
the
confidential
servant
of
mynheer
john
de
witt
good
let
him
i
can
not
wait
said
a
voice
in
the
lobby
and
at
the
same
time
forcing
his
way
in
craeke
rushed
into
the
this
abrupt
entrance
was
such
an
infringement
on
the
established
rules
of
the
household
of
cornelius
van
baerle
that
the
latter
at
the
sight
of
craeke
almost
convulsively
moved
his
hand
which
covered
the
bulbs
so
that
two
of
them
fell
on
the
floor
one
of
them
rolling
under
a
small
table
and
the
other
into
the
fireplace
zounds
said
cornelius
eagerly
picking
up
his
precious
bulbs
what
s
the
matter
the
matter
sir
said
craeke
laying
a
paper
on
the
large
table
on
which
the
third
bulb
was
lying
the
matter
is
that
you
are
requested
to
read
this
paper
without
losing
one
and
craeke
who
thought
he
had
remarked
in
the
streets
of
dort
symptoms
of
a
tumult
similar
to
that
which
he
had
witnessed
before
his
departure
from
the
hague
ran
off
without
even
looking
behind
him
all
right
all
right
my
dear
craeke
said
cornelius
stretching
his
arm
under
the
table
for
the
bulb
your
paper
shall
be
read
indeed
it
then
examining
the
bulb
which
he
held
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
he
said
well
here
is
one
of
them
uninjured
that
confounded
craeke
thus
to
rush
into
my
let
us
now
look
after
the
and
without
laying
down
the
bulb
which
he
already
held
baerle
went
to
the
fireplace
knelt
down
and
stirred
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
the
ashes
which
fortunately
were
quite
cold
he
at
once
felt
the
other
bulb
well
here
it
is
he
said
and
looking
at
it
with
almost
fatherly
affection
he
exclaimed
uninjured
as
the
first
at
this
very
instant
and
whilst
cornelius
still
on
his
knees
was
examining
his
pets
the
door
of
the
was
so
violently
shaken
and
opened
in
such
a
brusque
manner
that
cornelius
felt
rising
in
his
cheeks
and
his
ears
the
glow
of
that
evil
counsellor
which
is
called
wrath
now
what
is
it
again
he
demanded
are
people
going
mad
here
oh
sir
sir
cried
the
servant
rushing
into
the
with
a
much
paler
face
and
with
a
much
more
frightened
mien
than
craeke
had
shown
well
asked
cornelius
foreboding
some
mischief
from
the
double
breach
of
the
strict
rule
of
his
house
oh
sir
fly
fly
quick
cried
the
servant
fly
and
what
for
sir
the
house
is
full
of
the
guards
of
the
what
do
they
want
they
want
what
for
to
arrest
arrest
me
arrest
me
do
you
say
yes
sir
and
they
are
headed
by
a
what
s
the
meaning
of
all
this
said
van
baerle
grasping
in
his
hands
the
two
bulbs
and
directing
his
terrified
glance
towards
the
staircase
they
are
coming
up
they
are
coming
up
cried
the
servant
oh
my
dear
child
my
worthy
master
cried
the
old
housekeeper
who
now
likewise
made
her
appearance
in
the
take
your
gold
your
jewelry
and
fly
fly
but
how
shall
i
make
my
escape
nurse
said
van
baerle
jump
out
of
the
feet
from
the
ground
but
you
will
fall
on
six
feet
of
soft
soil
yes
but
i
should
fall
on
my
never
mind
jump
cornelius
took
the
third
bulb
approached
the
window
and
opened
it
but
seeing
what
havoc
he
would
necessarily
cause
in
his
borders
and
more
than
this
what
a
height
he
would
have
to
jump
he
called
out
never
and
fell
back
a
step
at
this
moment
they
saw
across
the
banister
of
the
staircase
the
points
of
the
halberds
of
the
soldiers
rising
the
housekeeper
raised
her
hands
to
heaven
as
to
cornelius
van
baerle
it
must
be
stated
to
his
honour
not
as
a
man
but
as
a
his
only
thought
was
for
his
inestimable
bulbs
looking
about
for
a
paper
in
which
to
wrap
them
up
he
noticed
the
from
the
bible
which
craeke
had
laid
upon
the
table
took
it
without
in
his
confusion
remembering
whence
it
came
folded
in
it
the
three
bulbs
secreted
them
in
his
bosom
and
waited
at
this
very
moment
the
soldiers
preceded
by
a
magistrate
entered
the
room
are
you
cornelius
van
baerle
demanded
the
magistrate
who
although
knowing
the
young
man
very
well
put
his
question
according
to
the
forms
of
justice
which
gave
his
proceedings
a
much
more
dignified
air
i
am
that
person
master
van
spennen
answered
cornelius
politely
to
his
judge
and
you
know
it
very
then
give
up
to
us
the
seditious
papers
which
you
secrete
in
your
the
seditious
papers
repeated
cornelius
quite
dumfounded
at
the
imputation
now
don
t
look
astonished
if
you
i
vow
to
you
master
van
spennen
cornelius
replied
that
i
am
completely
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
you
then
i
shall
put
you
in
the
way
doctor
said
the
judge
give
up
to
us
the
papers
which
the
traitor
cornelius
de
witt
deposited
with
you
in
the
month
of
january
a
sudden
light
came
into
the
mind
of
cornelius
halloa
said
van
spennen
you
begin
now
to
remember
don
t
you
indeed
i
do
but
you
spoke
of
seditious
papers
and
i
have
none
of
that
you
deny
it
then
certainly
i
the
magistrate
turned
round
and
took
a
rapid
survey
of
the
whole
cabinet
where
is
the
apartment
you
call
your
he
asked
the
very
same
where
you
now
are
master
van
the
magistrate
cast
a
glance
at
a
small
note
at
the
top
of
his
papers
all
right
he
said
like
a
man
who
is
sure
of
his
ground
then
turning
round
towards
cornelius
he
continued
will
you
give
up
those
papers
to
me
but
i
can
not
master
van
spennen
those
papers
do
not
belong
to
me
they
have
been
deposited
with
me
as
a
trust
and
a
trust
is
dr
cornelius
said
the
judge
in
the
name
of
the
states
i
order
you
to
open
this
drawer
and
to
give
up
to
me
the
papers
which
it
saying
this
the
judge
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
third
drawer
of
the
press
near
the
fireplace
in
this
very
drawer
indeed
the
papers
deposited
by
the
warden
of
the
dikes
with
his
godson
were
lying
a
proof
that
the
police
had
received
very
exact
information
ah
you
will
not
said
van
spennen
when
he
saw
cornelius
standing
immovable
and
bewildered
then
i
shall
open
the
drawer
and
pulling
out
the
drawer
to
its
full
length
the
magistrate
at
first
alighted
on
about
twenty
bulbs
carefully
arranged
and
ticketed
and
then
on
the
paper
parcel
which
had
remained
in
exactly
the
same
state
as
it
was
when
delivered
by
the
unfortunate
cornelius
de
witt
to
his
godson
the
magistrate
broke
the
seals
tore
off
the
envelope
cast
an
eager
glance
on
the
first
leaves
which
met
his
eye
and
then
exclaimed
in
a
terrible
voice
well
justice
has
been
rightly
informed
after
all
how
said
cornelius
how
is
this
don
t
pretend
to
be
ignorant
mynheer
van
baerle
answered
the
magistrate
follow
how
s
that
follow
you
cried
the
doctor
yes
sir
for
in
the
name
of
the
states
i
arrest
arrests
were
not
as
yet
made
in
the
name
of
william
of
orange
he
had
not
been
stadtholder
long
enough
for
that
arrest
me
cried
cornelius
but
what
have
i
done
that
s
no
affair
of
mine
doctor
you
will
explain
all
that
before
your
where
at
the
cornelius
in
mute
stupefaction
embraced
his
old
nurse
who
was
in
a
swoon
shook
hands
with
his
servants
who
were
bathed
in
tears
and
followed
the
magistrate
who
put
him
in
a
coach
as
a
prisoner
of
state
and
had
him
driven
at
full
gallop
to
the
hague
chapter
an
invasion
the
incident
just
related
was
as
the
reader
has
guessed
before
this
the
diabolical
work
of
mynheer
isaac
boxtel
it
will
be
remembered
that
with
the
help
of
his
telescope
not
even
the
least
detail
of
the
private
meeting
between
cornelius
de
witt
and
van
baerle
had
escaped
him
he
had
indeed
heard
nothing
but
he
had
seen
everything
and
had
rightly
concluded
that
the
papers
intrusted
by
the
warden
to
the
doctor
must
have
been
of
great
importance
as
he
saw
van
baerle
so
carefully
secreting
the
parcel
in
the
drawer
where
he
used
to
keep
his
most
precious
bulbs
the
upshot
of
all
this
was
that
when
boxtel
who
watched
the
course
of
political
events
much
more
attentively
than
his
neighbour
cornelius
was
used
to
do
heard
the
news
of
the
brothers
de
witt
being
arrested
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
against
the
states
he
thought
within
his
heart
that
very
likely
he
needed
only
to
say
one
word
and
the
godson
would
be
arrested
as
well
as
the
godfather
yet
full
of
happiness
as
was
boxtel
s
heart
at
the
chance
he
at
first
shrank
with
horror
from
the
idea
of
informing
against
a
man
whom
this
information
might
lead
to
the
scaffold
but
there
is
this
terrible
thing
in
evil
thoughts
that
evil
minds
soon
grow
familiar
with
them
besides
this
mynheer
isaac
boxtel
encouraged
himself
with
the
following
sophism
cornelius
de
witt
is
a
bad
citizen
as
he
is
charged
with
high
treason
and
arrested
i
on
the
contrary
am
a
good
citizen
as
i
am
not
charged
with
anything
in
the
world
as
i
am
as
free
as
the
air
of
heaven
if
therefore
cornelius
de
witt
is
a
bad
citizen
of
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
he
is
charged
with
high
treason
and
arrested
his
accomplice
cornelius
van
baerle
is
no
less
a
bad
citizen
than
himself
and
as
i
am
a
good
citizen
and
as
it
is
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
to
inform
against
the
bad
ones
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
against
cornelius
van
specious
as
this
mode
of
reasoning
might
sound
it
would
not
perhaps
have
taken
so
complete
a
hold
of
boxtel
nor
would
he
perhaps
have
yielded
to
the
mere
desire
of
vengeance
which
was
gnawing
at
his
heart
had
not
the
demon
of
envy
been
joined
with
that
of
cupidity
boxtel
was
quite
aware
of
the
progress
which
van
baerle
had
made
towards
producing
the
grand
black
tulip
cornelius
notwithstanding
all
his
modesty
had
not
been
able
to
hide
from
his
most
intimate
friends
that
he
was
all
but
certain
to
win
in
the
year
of
grace
the
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
offered
by
the
horticultural
society
of
haarlem
it
was
just
this
certainty
of
cornelius
van
baerle
that
caused
the
fever
which
raged
in
the
heart
of
isaac
boxtel
if
cornelius
should
be
arrested
there
would
necessarily
be
a
great
upset
in
his
house
and
during
the
night
after
his
arrest
no
one
would
think
of
keeping
watch
over
the
tulips
in
his
garden
now
in
that
night
boxtel
would
climb
over
the
wall
and
as
he
knew
the
position
of
the
bulb
which
was
to
produce
the
grand
black
tulip
he
would
filch
it
and
instead
of
flowering
for
cornelius
it
would
flower
for
him
isaac
he
also
instead
of
van
baerle
would
have
the
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
not
to
speak
of
the
sublime
honour
of
calling
the
new
flower
tulipa
nigra
boxtellensis
a
result
which
would
satisfy
not
only
his
vengeance
but
also
his
cupidity
and
his
ambition
awake
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
grand
black
tulip
asleep
he
dreamed
of
it
at
last
on
the
of
august
about
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
temptation
grew
so
strong
that
mynheer
isaac
was
no
longer
able
to
resist
it
accordingly
he
wrote
an
anonymous
information
the
minute
exactness
of
which
made
up
for
its
want
of
authenticity
and
posted
his
letter
never
did
a
venomous
paper
slipped
into
the
jaws
of
the
bronze
lions
at
venice
produce
a
more
prompt
and
terrible
effect
on
the
same
evening
the
letter
reached
the
principal
magistrate
who
without
a
moment
s
delay
convoked
his
colleagues
early
for
the
next
morning
on
the
following
morning
therefore
they
assembled
and
decided
on
van
baerle
s
arrest
placing
the
order
for
its
execution
in
the
hands
of
master
van
spennen
who
as
we
have
seen
performed
his
duty
like
a
true
hollander
and
who
arrested
the
doctor
at
the
very
hour
when
the
orange
party
at
the
hague
were
roasting
the
bleeding
shreds
of
flesh
torn
from
the
corpses
of
cornelius
and
john
de
witt
but
whether
from
a
feeling
of
shame
or
from
craven
weakness
isaac
boxtel
did
not
venture
that
day
to
point
his
telescope
either
at
the
garden
or
at
the
laboratory
or
at
the
he
knew
too
well
what
was
about
to
happen
in
the
house
of
the
poor
doctor
to
feel
any
desire
to
look
into
it
he
did
not
even
get
up
when
his
only
servant
who
envied
the
lot
of
the
servants
of
cornelius
just
as
bitterly
as
boxtel
did
that
of
their
master
entered
his
bedroom
he
said
to
the
man
i
shall
not
get
up
i
am
about
nine
o
clock
he
heard
a
great
noise
in
the
street
which
made
him
tremble
at
this
moment
he
was
paler
than
a
real
invalid
and
shook
more
violently
than
a
man
in
the
height
of
fever
his
servant
entered
the
room
boxtel
hid
himself
under
the
counterpane
oh
sir
cried
the
servant
not
without
some
inkling
that
whilst
deploring
the
mishap
which
had
befallen
van
baerle
he
was
announcing
agreeable
news
to
his
master
oh
sir
you
do
not
know
then
what
is
happening
at
this
moment
how
can
i
know
it
answered
boxtel
with
an
almost
unintelligible
voice
well
mynheer
boxtel
at
this
moment
your
neighbour
cornelius
van
baerle
is
arrested
for
high
nonsense
boxtel
muttered
with
a
faltering
voice
the
thing
is
faith
sir
at
any
rate
that
s
what
people
say
and
besides
i
have
seen
judge
van
spennen
with
the
archers
entering
the
well
if
you
have
seen
it
with
your
own
eyes
that
s
a
different
case
at
all
events
said
the
servant
i
shall
go
and
inquire
once
more
be
you
quiet
sir
i
shall
let
you
know
all
about
boxtel
contented
himself
with
signifying
his
approval
of
the
zeal
of
his
servant
by
dumb
show
the
man
went
out
and
returned
in
half
an
hour
oh
sir
all
that
i
told
you
is
indeed
quite
how
so
mynheer
van
baerle
is
arrested
and
has
been
put
into
a
carriage
and
they
are
driving
him
to
the
to
the
hague
yes
to
the
hague
and
if
what
people
say
is
true
it
won
t
do
him
much
and
what
do
they
say
boxtel
asked
faith
sir
they
say
but
it
is
not
quite
sure
that
by
this
hour
the
burghers
must
be
murdering
mynheer
cornelius
and
mynheer
john
de
oh
muttered
or
rather
growled
boxtel
closing
his
eyes
from
the
dreadful
picture
which
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
why
to
be
sure
said
the
servant
to
himself
whilst
leaving
the
room
mynheer
isaac
boxtel
must
be
very
sick
not
to
have
jumped
from
his
bed
on
hearing
such
good
and
in
reality
isaac
boxtel
was
very
sick
like
a
man
who
has
murdered
another
but
he
had
murdered
his
man
with
a
double
object
the
first
was
attained
the
second
was
still
to
be
attained
night
closed
in
it
was
the
night
which
boxtel
had
looked
forward
to
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
he
got
up
he
then
climbed
into
his
sycamore
he
had
calculated
correctly
no
one
thought
of
keeping
watch
over
the
garden
the
house
and
the
servants
were
all
in
the
utmost
confusion
he
heard
the
clock
strike
ten
eleven
twelve
at
midnight
with
a
beating
heart
trembling
hands
and
a
livid
countenance
he
descended
from
the
tree
took
a
ladder
leaned
it
against
the
wall
mounted
it
to
the
last
step
but
one
and
listened
all
was
perfectly
quiet
not
a
sound
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
one
solitary
light
that
of
the
housekeeper
was
burning
in
the
house
this
silence
and
this
darkness
emboldened
boxtel
he
got
astride
the
wall
stopped
for
an
instant
and
after
having
ascertained
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
he
put
his
ladder
from
his
own
garden
into
that
of
cornelius
and
descended
then
knowing
to
an
inch
where
the
bulbs
which
were
to
produce
the
black
tulip
were
planted
he
ran
towards
the
spot
following
however
the
gravelled
walks
in
order
not
to
be
betrayed
by
his
footprints
and
on
arriving
at
the
precise
spot
he
proceeded
with
the
eagerness
of
a
tiger
to
plunge
his
hand
into
the
soft
ground
he
found
nothing
and
thought
he
was
mistaken
in
the
meanwhile
the
cold
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
he
felt
about
close
by
it
nothing
he
felt
about
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
nothing
he
felt
about
in
front
and
at
the
back
nothing
he
was
nearly
mad
when
at
last
he
satisfied
himself
that
on
that
very
morning
the
earth
had
been
disturbed
in
fact
whilst
boxtel
was
lying
in
bed
cornelius
had
gone
down
to
his
garden
had
taken
up
the
mother
bulb
and
as
we
have
seen
divided
it
into
three
boxtel
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
the
place
he
dug
up
with
his
hands
more
than
ten
square
feet
of
ground
at
last
no
doubt
remained
of
his
misfortune
mad
with
rage
he
returned
to
his
ladder
mounted
the
wall
drew
up
the
ladder
flung
it
into
his
own
garden
and
jumped
after
it
all
at
once
a
last
ray
of
hope
presented
itself
to
his
mind
the
seedling
bulbs
might
be
in
the
it
was
therefore
only
requisite
to
make
his
entry
there
as
he
had
done
into
the
garden
there
he
would
find
them
and
moreover
it
was
not
at
all
difficult
as
the
sashes
of
the
might
be
raised
like
those
of
a
greenhouse
cornelius
had
opened
them
on
that
morning
and
no
one
had
thought
of
closing
them
again
everything
therefore
depended
upon
whether
he
could
procure
a
ladder
of
sufficient
length
one
of
feet
instead
of
ten
boxtel
had
noticed
in
the
street
where
he
lived
a
house
which
was
being
repaired
and
against
which
a
very
tall
ladder
was
placed
this
ladder
would
do
admirably
unless
the
workmen
had
taken
it
away
he
ran
to
the
house
the
ladder
was
there
boxtel
took
it
carried
it
with
great
exertion
to
his
garden
and
with
even
greater
difficulty
raised
it
against
the
wall
of
van
baerle
s
house
where
it
just
reached
to
the
window
boxtel
put
a
lighted
dark
lantern
into
his
pocket
mounted
the
ladder
and
slipped
into
the
on
reaching
this
sanctuary
of
the
florist
he
stopped
supporting
himself
against
the
table
his
legs
failed
him
his
heart
beat
as
if
it
would
choke
him
here
it
was
even
worse
than
in
the
garden
there
boxtel
was
only
a
trespasser
here
he
was
a
thief
however
he
took
courage
again
he
had
not
gone
so
far
to
turn
back
with
empty
hands
but
in
vain
did
he
search
the
whole
room
open
and
shut
all
the
drawers
even
that
privileged
one
where
the
parcel
which
had
been
so
fatal
to
cornelius
had
been
deposited
he
found
ticketed
as
in
a
botanical
garden
the
jane
the
john
de
witt
the
and
the
coloured
tulip
but
of
the
black
tulip
or
rather
the
seedling
bulbs
within
which
it
was
still
sleeping
not
a
trace
was
found
and
yet
on
looking
over
the
register
of
seeds
and
bulbs
which
van
baerle
kept
in
duplicate
if
possible
even
with
greater
exactitude
and
care
than
the
first
commercial
houses
of
amsterdam
their
ledgers
boxtel
read
these
lines
of
august
i
have
taken
up
the
mother
bulb
of
the
grand
black
tulip
which
i
have
divided
into
three
perfect
oh
these
bulbs
these
bulbs
howled
boxtel
turning
over
everything
in
the
where
could
he
have
concealed
them
then
suddenly
striking
his
forehead
in
his
frenzy
he
called
out
oh
wretch
that
i
am
oh
thrice
fool
boxtel
would
any
one
be
separated
from
his
bulbs
would
any
one
leave
them
at
dort
when
one
goes
to
the
hague
could
one
live
far
from
one
s
bulbs
when
they
enclose
the
grand
black
tulip
he
had
time
to
get
hold
of
them
the
scoundrel
he
has
them
about
him
he
has
taken
them
to
the
hague
it
was
like
a
flash
of
lightning
which
showed
to
boxtel
the
abyss
of
a
uselessly
committed
crime
boxtel
sank
quite
paralyzed
on
that
very
table
and
on
that
very
spot
where
some
hours
before
the
unfortunate
van
baerle
had
so
leisurely
and
with
such
intense
delight
contemplated
his
darling
bulbs
well
then
after
all
said
the
envious
boxtel
raising
his
livid
face
from
his
hands
in
which
it
had
been
buried
if
he
has
them
he
can
keep
them
only
as
long
as
he
lives
and
the
rest
of
this
detestable
thought
was
expressed
by
a
hideous
smile
the
bulbs
are
at
the
hague
he
said
therefore
i
can
no
longer
live
at
dort
away
then
for
them
to
the
hague
to
the
hague
and
boxtel
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
treasures
about
him
so
entirely
were
his
thoughts
absorbed
by
another
inestimable
treasure
let
himself
out
by
the
window
glided
down
the
ladder
carried
it
back
to
the
place
whence
he
had
taken
it
and
like
a
beast
of
prey
returned
growling
to
his
house
chapter
the
family
cell
it
was
about
midnight
when
poor
van
baerle
was
locked
up
in
the
prison
of
the
buytenhof
what
rosa
foresaw
had
come
to
pass
on
finding
the
cell
of
cornelius
de
witt
empty
the
wrath
of
the
people
ran
very
high
and
had
gryphus
fallen
into
the
hands
of
those
madmen
he
would
certainly
have
had
to
pay
with
his
life
for
the
prisoner
but
this
fury
had
vented
itself
most
fully
on
the
two
brothers
when
they
were
overtaken
by
the
murderers
thanks
to
the
precaution
which
william
the
man
of
precautions
had
taken
in
having
the
gates
of
the
city
closed
a
momentary
lull
had
therefore
set
in
whilst
the
prison
was
empty
and
rosa
availed
herself
of
this
favourable
moment
to
come
forth
from
her
hiding
place
which
she
also
induced
her
father
to
leave
the
prison
was
therefore
completely
deserted
why
should
people
remain
in
the
jail
whilst
murder
was
going
on
at
the
gryphus
came
forth
trembling
behind
the
courageous
rosa
they
went
to
close
the
great
gate
at
least
as
well
as
it
would
close
considering
that
it
was
half
demolished
it
was
easy
to
see
that
a
hurricane
of
mighty
fury
had
vented
itself
upon
it
about
four
o
clock
a
return
of
the
noise
was
heard
but
of
no
threatening
character
to
gryphus
and
his
daughter
the
people
were
only
dragging
in
the
two
corpses
which
they
came
back
to
gibbet
at
the
usual
place
of
execution
rosa
hid
herself
this
time
also
but
only
that
she
might
not
see
the
ghastly
spectacle
at
midnight
people
again
knocked
at
the
gate
of
the
jail
or
rather
at
the
barricade
which
served
in
its
stead
it
was
cornelius
van
baerle
whom
they
were
bringing
when
the
jailer
received
this
new
inmate
and
saw
from
the
warrant
the
name
and
station
of
his
prisoner
he
muttered
with
his
turnkey
smile
godson
of
cornelius
de
witt
well
young
man
we
have
the
family
cell
here
and
we
will
give
it
to
and
quite
enchanted
with
his
joke
the
ferocious
orangeman
took
his
cresset
and
his
keys
to
conduct
cornelius
to
the
cell
which
on
that
very
morning
cornelius
de
witt
had
left
to
go
into
exile
or
what
in
revolutionary
times
is
meant
instead
by
those
sublime
philosophers
who
lay
it
down
as
an
axiom
of
high
policy
it
is
the
dead
only
who
do
not
on
the
way
which
the
despairing
florist
had
to
traverse
to
reach
that
cell
he
heard
nothing
but
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
saw
nothing
but
the
face
of
a
young
girl
the
dog
rushed
forth
from
a
niche
in
the
wall
shaking
his
heavy
chain
and
sniffing
all
round
cornelius
in
order
so
much
the
better
to
recognise
him
in
case
he
should
be
ordered
to
pounce
upon
him
the
young
girl
whilst
the
prisoner
was
mounting
the
staircase
appeared
at
the
narrow
door
of
her
chamber
which
opened
on
that
very
flight
of
steps
and
holding
the
lamp
in
her
right
hand
she
at
the
same
time
lit
up
her
pretty
blooming
face
surrounded
by
a
profusion
of
rich
wavy
golden
locks
whilst
with
her
left
she
held
her
white
closely
over
her
breast
having
been
roused
from
her
first
slumber
by
the
unexpected
arrival
of
van
baerle
it
would
have
made
a
fine
picture
worthy
of
rembrandt
the
gloomy
winding
stairs
illuminated
by
the
reddish
glare
of
the
cresset
of
gryphus
with
his
scowling
jailer
s
countenance
at
the
top
the
melancholy
figure
of
cornelius
bending
over
the
banister
to
look
down
upon
the
sweet
face
of
rosa
standing
as
it
were
in
the
bright
frame
of
the
door
of
her
chamber
with
embarrassed
mien
at
being
thus
seen
by
a
stranger
and
at
the
bottom
quite
in
the
shade
where
the
details
are
absorbed
in
the
obscurity
the
mastiff
with
his
eyes
glistening
like
carbuncles
and
shaking
his
chain
on
which
the
double
light
from
the
lamp
of
rosa
and
the
lantern
of
gryphus
threw
a
brilliant
glitter
the
sublime
master
would
however
have
been
altogether
unable
to
render
the
sorrow
expressed
in
the
face
of
rosa
when
she
saw
this
pale
handsome
young
man
slowly
climbing
the
stairs
and
thought
of
the
full
import
of
the
words
which
her
father
had
just
spoken
you
will
have
the
family
this
vision
lasted
but
a
moment
much
less
time
than
we
have
taken
to
describe
it
gryphus
then
proceeded
on
his
way
cornelius
was
forced
to
follow
him
and
five
minutes
afterwards
he
entered
his
prison
of
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
more
as
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
with
it
gryphus
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
bed
on
which
the
martyr
had
suffered
so
much
who
on
that
day
had
rendered
his
soul
to
god
then
taking
up
his
cresset
he
quitted
the
cell
thus
left
alone
cornelius
threw
himself
on
his
bed
but
he
slept
not
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
narrow
window
barred
with
iron
which
looked
on
the
buytenhof
and
in
this
way
saw
from
behind
the
trees
that
first
pale
beam
of
light
which
morning
sheds
on
the
earth
as
a
white
mantle
now
and
then
during
the
night
horses
had
galloped
at
a
smart
pace
over
the
buytenhof
the
heavy
tramp
of
the
patrols
had
resounded
from
the
pavement
and
the
slow
matches
of
the
arquebuses
flaring
in
the
east
wind
had
thrown
up
at
intervals
a
sudden
glare
as
far
as
to
the
panes
of
his
window
but
when
the
rising
sun
began
to
gild
the
coping
stones
at
the
gable
ends
of
the
houses
cornelius
eager
to
know
whether
there
was
any
living
creature
about
him
approached
the
window
and
cast
a
sad
look
round
the
circular
yard
before
him
at
the
end
of
the
yard
a
dark
mass
tinted
with
a
dingy
blue
by
the
morning
dawn
rose
before
him
its
dark
outlines
standing
out
in
contrast
to
the
houses
already
illuminated
by
the
pale
light
of
early
morning
cornelius
recognised
the
gibbet
on
it
were
suspended
two
shapeless
trunks
which
indeed
were
no
more
than
bleeding
skeletons
the
good
people
of
the
hague
had
chopped
off
the
flesh
of
its
victims
but
faithfully
carried
the
remainder
to
the
gibbet
to
have
a
pretext
for
a
double
inscription
written
on
a
huge
placard
on
which
cornelius
with
the
keen
sight
of
a
young
man
of
was
able
to
read
the
following
lines
daubed
by
the
coarse
brush
of
a
here
are
hanging
the
great
rogue
of
the
name
of
john
de
witt
and
the
little
rogue
cornelius
de
witt
his
brother
two
enemies
of
the
people
but
great
friends
of
the
king
of
cornelius
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
and
in
the
agony
of
his
frantic
terror
knocked
with
his
hands
and
feet
at
the
door
so
violently
and
continuously
that
gryphus
with
his
huge
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
ran
furiously
up
the
jailer
opened
the
door
with
terrible
imprecations
against
the
prisoner
who
disturbed
him
at
an
hour
which
master
gryphus
was
not
accustomed
to
be
aroused
well
now
by
my
soul
he
is
mad
this
new
de
witt
he
cried
but
all
those
de
witts
have
the
devil
in
master
master
cried
cornelius
seizing
the
jailer
by
the
arm
and
dragging
him
towards
the
window
master
what
have
i
read
down
there
where
down
there
on
that
and
trembling
pale
and
gasping
for
breath
he
pointed
to
the
gibbet
at
the
other
side
of
the
yard
with
the
cynical
inscription
surmounting
it
gryphus
broke
out
into
a
laugh
eh
eh
he
answered
so
you
have
read
it
well
my
good
sir
that
s
what
people
will
get
for
corresponding
with
the
enemies
of
his
highness
the
prince
of
the
brothers
de
witt
are
murdered
cornelius
muttered
with
the
cold
sweat
on
his
brow
and
sank
on
his
bed
his
arms
hanging
by
his
side
and
his
eyes
closed
the
brothers
de
witt
have
been
judged
by
the
people
said
gryphus
you
call
that
murdered
do
you
well
i
call
it
and
seeing
that
the
prisoner
was
not
only
quiet
but
entirely
prostrate
and
senseless
he
rushed
from
the
cell
violently
slamming
the
door
and
noisily
drawing
the
bolts
recovering
his
consciousness
cornelius
found
himself
alone
and
recognised
the
room
where
he
was
the
family
cell
as
gryphus
had
called
it
as
the
fatal
passage
leading
to
ignominious
death
and
as
he
was
a
philosopher
and
more
than
that
as
he
was
a
christian
he
began
to
pray
for
the
soul
of
his
godfather
then
for
that
of
the
grand
pensionary
and
at
last
submitted
with
resignation
to
all
the
sufferings
which
god
might
ordain
for
him
then
turning
again
to
the
concerns
of
earth
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
was
alone
in
his
dungeon
he
drew
from
his
breast
the
three
bulbs
of
the
black
tulip
and
concealed
them
behind
a
block
of
stone
on
which
the
traditional
of
the
prison
was
standing
in
the
darkest
corner
of
his
cell
useless
labour
of
so
many
years
such
sweet
hopes
crushed
his
discovery
was
after
all
to
lead
to
naught
just
as
his
own
career
was
to
be
cut
short
here
in
his
prison
there
was
not
a
trace
of
vegetation
not
an
atom
of
soil
not
a
ray
of
sunshine
at
this
thought
cornelius
fell
into
a
gloomy
despair
from
which
he
was
only
aroused
by
an
extraordinary
circumstance
what
was
this
circumstance
we
shall
inform
the
reader
in
our
next
chapter
chapter
the
jailer
s
daughter
on
the
same
evening
gryphus
as
he
brought
the
prisoner
his
mess
slipped
on
the
damp
flags
whilst
opening
the
door
of
the
cell
and
fell
in
the
attempt
to
steady
himself
on
his
hand
but
as
it
was
turned
the
wrong
way
he
broke
his
arm
just
above
the
wrist
cornelius
rushed
forward
towards
the
jailer
but
gryphus
who
was
not
yet
aware
of
the
serious
nature
of
his
injury
called
out
to
him
it
is
nothing
don
t
you
he
then
tried
to
support
himself
on
his
arm
but
the
bone
gave
way
then
only
he
felt
the
pain
and
uttered
a
cry
when
he
became
aware
that
his
arm
was
broken
this
man
so
harsh
to
others
fell
swooning
on
the
threshold
where
he
remained
motionless
and
cold
as
if
dead
during
all
this
time
the
door
of
the
cell
stood
open
and
cornelius
found
himself
almost
free
but
the
thought
never
entered
his
mind
of
profiting
by
this
accident
he
had
seen
from
the
manner
in
which
the
arm
was
bent
and
from
the
noise
it
made
in
bending
that
the
bone
was
fractured
and
that
the
patient
must
be
in
great
pain
and
now
he
thought
of
nothing
else
but
of
administering
relief
to
the
sufferer
however
little
benevolent
the
man
had
shown
himself
during
their
short
interview
at
the
noise
of
gryphus
s
fall
and
at
the
cry
which
escaped
him
a
hasty
step
was
heard
on
the
staircase
and
immediately
after
a
lovely
apparition
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
cornelius
it
was
the
beautiful
young
frisian
who
seeing
her
father
stretched
on
the
ground
and
the
prisoner
bending
over
him
uttered
a
faint
cry
as
in
the
first
fright
she
thought
gryphus
whose
brutality
she
well
knew
had
fallen
in
consequence
of
a
struggle
between
him
and
the
prisoner
cornelius
understood
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
girl
at
the
very
moment
when
the
suspicion
arose
in
her
heart
but
one
moment
told
her
the
true
state
of
the
case
and
ashamed
of
her
first
thoughts
she
cast
her
beautiful
eyes
wet
with
tears
on
the
young
man
and
said
to
him
i
beg
your
pardon
and
thank
you
sir
the
first
for
what
i
have
thought
and
the
second
for
what
you
are
cornelius
blushed
and
said
i
am
but
doing
my
duty
as
a
christian
in
helping
my
yes
and
affording
him
your
help
this
evening
you
have
forgotten
the
abuse
which
he
heaped
on
you
this
morning
oh
sir
this
is
more
than
humanity
this
is
indeed
christian
cornelius
cast
his
eyes
on
the
beautiful
girl
quite
astonished
to
hear
from
the
mouth
of
one
so
humble
such
a
noble
and
feeling
speech
but
he
had
no
time
to
express
his
surprise
gryphus
recovered
from
his
swoon
opened
his
eyes
and
as
his
brutality
was
returning
with
his
senses
he
growled
that
s
it
a
fellow
is
in
a
hurry
to
bring
to
a
prisoner
his
supper
and
falls
and
breaks
his
arm
and
is
left
lying
on
the
hush
my
father
said
rosa
you
are
unjust
to
this
gentleman
whom
i
found
endeavouring
to
give
you
his
his
aid
gryphus
replied
with
a
doubtful
air
it
is
quite
true
master
i
am
quite
ready
to
help
you
still
you
said
gryphus
are
you
a
medical
man
it
was
formerly
my
and
so
you
would
be
able
to
set
my
arm
and
what
would
you
need
to
do
it
let
us
two
splinters
of
wood
and
some
linen
for
a
do
you
hear
rosa
said
gryphus
the
prisoner
is
going
to
set
my
arm
that
s
a
saving
come
assist
me
to
get
up
i
feel
as
heavy
as
rosa
lent
the
sufferer
her
shoulder
he
put
his
unhurt
arm
around
her
neck
and
making
an
effort
got
on
his
legs
whilst
cornelius
to
save
him
a
walk
pushed
a
chair
towards
him
gryphus
sat
down
then
turning
towards
his
daughter
he
said
well
didn
t
you
hear
go
and
fetch
what
is
rosa
went
down
and
immediately
after
returned
with
two
staves
of
a
small
barrel
and
a
large
roll
of
linen
bandage
cornelius
had
made
use
of
the
intervening
moments
to
take
off
the
man
s
coat
and
to
tuck
up
his
shirt
sleeve
is
this
what
you
require
sir
asked
rosa
yes
mademoiselle
answered
cornelius
looking
at
the
things
she
had
brought
yes
that
s
right
now
push
this
table
whilst
i
support
the
arm
of
your
rosa
pushed
the
table
cornelius
placed
the
broken
arm
on
it
so
as
to
make
it
flat
and
with
perfect
skill
set
the
bone
adjusted
the
splinters
and
fastened
the
bandages
at
the
last
touch
the
jailer
fainted
a
second
time
go
and
fetch
vinegar
mademoiselle
said
cornelius
we
will
bathe
his
temples
and
he
will
but
instead
of
acting
up
to
the
doctor
s
prescription
rosa
after
having
satisfied
herself
that
her
father
was
still
unconscious
approached
cornelius
and
said
service
for
service
what
do
you
mean
my
pretty
child
said
cornelius
i
mean
to
say
sir
that
the
judge
who
is
to
examine
you
has
inquired
for
the
room
in
which
you
are
confined
and
on
being
told
that
you
are
occupying
the
cell
of
mynheer
cornelius
de
witt
laughed
in
a
very
strange
and
very
disagreeable
manner
which
makes
me
fear
that
no
good
awaits
but
asked
cornelius
what
harm
can
they
do
to
me
look
at
that
but
i
am
not
guilty
said
cornelius
were
they
guilty
whom
you
see
down
there
gibbeted
mangled
and
torn
to
pieces
that
s
true
said
cornelius
gravely
and
besides
continued
rosa
the
people
want
to
find
you
guilty
but
whether
innocent
or
guilty
your
trial
begins
and
the
day
after
you
will
be
condemned
matters
are
settled
very
quickly
in
these
well
and
what
do
you
conclude
from
all
this
i
conclude
that
i
am
alone
that
i
am
weak
that
my
father
is
lying
in
a
swoon
that
the
dog
is
muzzled
and
that
consequently
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
your
making
your
escape
fly
then
that
s
what
i
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
i
was
not
able
to
save
mynheer
cornelius
or
mynheer
john
de
witt
and
that
i
should
like
to
save
you
only
be
quick
there
my
father
is
regaining
his
breath
one
minute
more
and
he
will
open
his
eyes
and
it
will
be
too
late
do
you
hesitate
in
fact
cornelius
stood
immovable
looking
at
rosa
yet
looking
at
her
as
if
he
did
not
hear
her
don
t
you
understand
me
said
the
young
girl
with
some
impatience
yes
i
do
said
cornelius
but
but
i
will
not
they
would
accuse
never
mind
said
rosa
blushing
never
mind
you
are
very
good
my
dear
child
replied
cornelius
but
i
you
stay
oh
sir
oh
sir
don
t
you
understand
that
you
will
be
condemned
to
death
executed
on
the
scaffold
perhaps
assassinated
and
torn
to
pieces
just
like
mynheer
john
and
mynheer
cornelius
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
think
of
me
but
fly
from
this
place
take
care
it
bears
ill
luck
to
the
de
witts
halloa
cried
the
jailer
recovering
his
senses
who
is
talking
of
those
rogues
those
wretches
those
villains
the
de
witts
don
t
be
angry
my
good
man
said
cornelius
with
his
smile
the
worst
thing
for
a
fracture
is
excitement
by
which
the
blood
is
thereupon
he
said
in
an
undertone
to
rosa
my
child
i
am
innocent
and
i
shall
await
my
trial
with
tranquillity
and
an
easy
hush
said
rosa
why
hush
my
father
must
not
suppose
that
we
have
been
talking
to
each
what
harm
would
that
do
what
harm
he
would
never
allow
me
to
come
here
any
more
said
rosa
cornelius
received
this
innocent
confidence
with
a
smile
he
felt
as
if
a
ray
of
good
fortune
were
shining
on
his
path
now
then
what
are
you
chattering
there
together
about
said
gryphus
rising
and
supporting
his
right
arm
with
his
left
nothing
said
rosa
the
doctor
is
explaining
to
me
what
diet
you
are
to
diet
diet
for
me
well
my
fine
girl
i
shall
put
you
on
diet
on
what
diet
my
father
never
to
go
to
the
cells
of
the
prisoners
and
if
ever
you
should
happen
to
go
to
leave
them
as
soon
as
possible
come
off
with
me
lead
the
way
and
be
rosa
and
cornelius
exchanged
glances
that
of
rosa
tried
to
express
there
you
see
that
of
cornelius
said
let
it
be
as
the
lord
chapter
cornelius
van
baerle
s
will
rosa
had
not
been
mistaken
the
judges
came
on
the
following
day
to
the
buytenhof
and
proceeded
with
the
trial
of
cornelius
van
baerle
the
examination
however
did
not
last
long
it
having
appeared
on
evidence
that
cornelius
had
kept
at
his
house
that
fatal
correspondence
of
the
brothers
de
witt
with
france
he
did
not
deny
it
the
only
point
about
which
there
seemed
any
difficulty
was
whether
this
correspondence
had
been
intrusted
to
him
by
his
godfather
cornelius
de
witt
but
as
since
the
death
of
those
two
martyrs
van
baerle
had
no
longer
any
reason
for
withholding
the
truth
he
not
only
did
not
deny
that
the
parcel
had
been
delivered
to
him
by
cornelius
de
witt
himself
but
he
also
stated
all
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
done
this
confession
involved
the
godson
in
the
crime
of
the
godfather
manifest
complicity
being
considered
to
exist
between
cornelius
de
witt
and
cornelius
van
baerle
the
honest
doctor
did
not
confine
himself
to
this
avowal
but
told
the
whole
truth
with
regard
to
his
own
tastes
habits
and
daily
life
he
described
his
indifference
to
politics
his
love
of
study
of
the
fine
arts
of
science
and
of
flowers
he
explained
that
since
the
day
when
cornelius
de
witt
handed
to
him
the
parcel
at
dort
he
himself
had
never
touched
nor
even
noticed
it
to
this
it
was
objected
that
in
this
respect
he
could
not
possibly
be
speaking
the
truth
since
the
papers
had
been
deposited
in
a
press
in
which
both
his
hands
and
his
eyes
must
have
been
engaged
every
day
cornelius
answered
that
it
was
indeed
so
that
however
he
never
put
his
hand
into
the
press
but
to
ascertain
whether
his
bulbs
were
dry
and
that
he
never
looked
into
it
but
to
see
if
they
were
beginning
to
sprout
to
this
again
it
was
objected
that
his
pretended
indifference
respecting
this
deposit
was
not
to
be
reasonably
entertained
as
he
could
not
have
received
such
papers
from
the
hand
of
his
godfather
without
being
made
acquainted
with
their
important
character
he
replied
that
his
godfather
cornelius
loved
him
too
well
and
above
all
that
he
was
too
considerate
a
man
to
have
communicated
to
him
anything
of
the
contents
of
the
parcel
well
knowing
that
such
a
confidence
would
only
have
caused
anxiety
to
him
who
received
it
to
this
it
was
objected
that
if
de
witt
had
wished
to
act
in
such
a
way
he
would
have
added
to
the
parcel
in
case
of
accidents
a
certificate
setting
forth
that
his
godson
was
an
entire
stranger
to
the
nature
of
this
correspondence
or
at
least
he
would
during
his
trial
have
written
a
letter
to
him
which
might
be
produced
as
his
justification
cornelius
replied
that
undoubtedly
his
godfather
could
not
have
thought
that
there
was
any
risk
for
the
safety
of
his
deposit
hidden
as
it
was
in
a
press
which
was
looked
upon
as
sacred
as
the
tabernacle
by
the
whole
household
of
van
baerle
and
that
consequently
he
had
considered
the
certificate
as
useless
as
to
a
letter
he
certainly
had
some
remembrance
that
some
moments
previous
to
his
arrest
whilst
he
was
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
one
of
the
rarest
of
his
bulbs
john
de
witt
s
servant
entered
his
and
handed
to
him
a
paper
but
the
whole
was
to
him
only
like
a
vague
dream
the
servant
had
disappeared
and
as
to
the
paper
perhaps
it
might
be
found
if
a
proper
search
were
made
as
far
as
craeke
was
concerned
it
was
impossible
to
find
him
as
he
had
left
holland
the
paper
also
was
not
very
likely
to
be
found
and
no
one
gave
himself
the
trouble
to
look
for
it
cornelius
himself
did
not
much
press
this
point
since
even
supposing
that
the
paper
should
turn
up
it
could
not
have
any
direct
connection
with
the
correspondence
which
constituted
the
crime
the
judges
wished
to
make
it
appear
as
though
they
wanted
to
urge
cornelius
to
make
a
better
defence
they
displayed
that
benevolent
patience
which
is
generally
a
sign
of
the
magistrate
s
being
interested
for
the
prisoner
or
of
a
man
s
having
so
completely
got
the
better
of
his
adversary
that
he
needs
no
longer
any
oppressive
means
to
ruin
him
cornelius
did
not
accept
of
this
hypocritical
protection
and
in
a
last
answer
which
he
set
forth
with
the
noble
bearing
of
a
martyr
and
the
calm
serenity
of
a
righteous
man
he
said
you
ask
me
things
gentlemen
to
which
i
can
answer
only
the
exact
truth
hear
it
the
parcel
was
put
into
my
hands
in
the
way
i
have
described
i
vow
before
god
that
i
was
and
am
still
ignorant
of
its
contents
and
that
it
was
not
until
my
arrest
that
i
learned
that
this
deposit
was
the
correspondence
of
the
grand
pensionary
with
the
marquis
de
louvois
and
lastly
i
vow
and
protest
that
i
do
not
understand
how
any
one
should
have
known
that
this
parcel
was
in
my
house
and
above
all
how
i
can
be
deemed
criminal
for
having
received
what
my
illustrious
and
unfortunate
godfather
brought
to
my
this
was
van
baerle
s
whole
defence
after
which
the
judges
began
to
deliberate
on
the
verdict
they
considered
that
every
offshoot
of
civil
discord
is
mischievous
because
it
revives
the
contest
which
it
is
the
interest
of
all
to
put
down
one
of
them
who
bore
the
character
of
a
profound
observer
laid
down
as
his
opinion
that
this
young
man
so
phlegmatic
in
appearance
must
in
reality
be
very
dangerous
as
under
this
icy
exterior
he
was
sure
to
conceal
an
ardent
desire
to
avenge
his
friends
the
de
witts
another
observed
that
the
love
of
tulips
agreed
perfectly
well
with
that
of
politics
and
that
it
was
proved
in
history
that
many
very
dangerous
men
were
engaged
in
gardening
just
as
if
it
had
been
their
profession
whilst
really
they
occupied
themselves
with
perfectly
different
concerns
witness
tarquin
the
elder
who
grew
poppies
at
gabii
and
the
great
condé
who
watered
his
carnations
at
the
dungeon
of
vincennes
at
the
very
moment
when
the
former
meditated
his
return
to
rome
and
the
latter
his
escape
from
prison
the
judge
summed
up
with
the
following
dilemma
either
cornelius
van
baerle
is
a
great
lover
of
tulips
or
a
great
lover
of
politics
in
either
case
he
has
told
us
a
falsehood
first
because
his
having
occupied
himself
with
politics
is
proved
by
the
letters
which
were
found
at
his
house
and
secondly
because
his
having
occupied
himself
with
tulips
is
proved
by
the
bulbs
which
leave
no
doubt
of
the
fact
and
herein
lies
the
enormity
of
the
case
as
cornelius
van
baerle
was
concerned
in
the
growing
of
tulips
and
in
the
pursuit
of
politics
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
prisoner
is
of
hybrid
character
of
an
amphibious
organisation
working
with
equal
ardour
at
politics
and
at
tulips
which
proves
him
to
belong
to
the
class
of
men
most
dangerous
to
public
tranquillity
and
shows
a
certain
or
rather
a
complete
analogy
between
his
character
and
that
of
those
master
minds
of
which
tarquin
the
elder
and
the
great
condé
have
been
felicitously
quoted
as
the
upshot
of
all
these
reasonings
was
that
his
highness
the
prince
stadtholder
of
holland
would
feel
infinitely
obliged
to
the
magistracy
of
the
hague
if
they
simplified
for
him
the
government
of
the
seven
provinces
by
destroying
even
the
least
germ
of
conspiracy
against
his
authority
this
argument
capped
all
the
others
and
in
order
so
much
the
more
effectually
to
destroy
the
germ
of
conspiracy
sentence
of
death
was
unanimously
pronounced
against
cornelius
van
baerle
as
being
arraigned
and
convicted
for
having
under
the
innocent
appearance
of
a
participated
in
the
detestable
intrigues
and
abominable
plots
of
the
brothers
de
witt
against
dutch
nationality
and
in
their
secret
relations
with
their
french
enemy
a
supplementary
clause
was
tacked
to
the
sentence
to
the
effect
that
the
aforesaid
cornelius
van
baerle
should
be
led
from
the
prison
of
the
buytenhof
to
the
scaffold
in
the
yard
of
the
same
name
where
the
public
executioner
would
cut
off
his
as
this
deliberation
was
a
most
serious
affair
it
lasted
a
full
during
which
the
prisoner
was
remanded
to
his
cell
there
the
recorder
of
the
states
came
to
read
the
sentence
to
him
master
gryphus
was
detained
in
bed
by
the
fever
caused
by
the
fracture
of
his
arm
his
keys
passed
into
the
hands
of
one
of
his
assistants
behind
this
turnkey
who
introduced
the
recorder
rosa
the
fair
frisian
maid
had
slipped
into
the
recess
of
the
door
with
a
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
to
stifle
her
sobs
cornelius
listened
to
the
sentence
with
an
expression
rather
of
surprise
than
sadness
after
the
sentence
was
read
the
recorder
asked
him
whether
he
had
anything
to
answer
indeed
i
have
not
he
replied
only
i
confess
that
among
all
the
causes
of
death
against
which
a
cautious
man
may
guard
i
should
never
have
supposed
this
to
be
on
this
answer
the
recorder
saluted
van
baerle
with
all
that
consideration
which
such
functionaries
generally
bestow
upon
great
criminals
of
every
sort
but
whilst
he
was
about
to
withdraw
cornelius
asked
by
the
bye
mr
recorder
what
day
is
the
thing
you
know
what
i
mean
to
take
place
why
answered
the
recorder
a
little
surprised
by
the
of
the
condemned
man
a
sob
was
heard
behind
the
door
and
cornelius
turned
round
to
look
from
whom
it
came
but
rosa
who
had
foreseen
this
movement
had
fallen
back
and
continued
cornelius
what
hour
is
appointed
twelve
o
clock
indeed
said
cornelius
i
think
i
heard
the
clock
strike
ten
about
twenty
minutes
ago
i
have
not
much
time
to
indeed
you
have
not
if
you
wish
to
make
your
peace
with
god
said
the
recorder
bowing
to
the
ground
you
may
ask
for
any
clergyman
you
saying
these
words
he
went
out
backwards
and
the
assistant
turnkey
was
going
to
follow
him
and
to
lock
the
door
of
cornelius
s
cell
when
a
white
and
trembling
arm
interposed
between
him
and
the
heavy
door
cornelius
saw
nothing
but
the
golden
brocade
cap
tipped
with
lace
such
as
the
frisian
girls
wore
he
heard
nothing
but
some
one
whispering
into
the
ear
of
the
turnkey
but
the
latter
put
his
heavy
keys
into
the
white
hand
which
was
stretched
out
to
receive
them
and
descending
some
steps
sat
down
on
the
staircase
which
was
thus
guarded
above
by
himself
and
below
by
the
dog
the
turned
round
and
cornelius
beheld
the
face
of
rosa
blanched
with
grief
and
her
beautiful
eyes
streaming
with
tears
she
went
up
to
cornelius
crossing
her
arms
on
her
heaving
breast
oh
sir
sir
she
said
but
sobs
choked
her
utterance
my
good
girl
cornelius
replied
with
emotion
what
do
you
wish
i
may
tell
you
that
my
time
on
earth
is
i
come
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
said
rosa
extending
her
arms
partly
towards
him
and
partly
towards
heaven
don
t
weep
so
rosa
said
the
prisoner
for
your
tears
go
much
more
to
my
heart
than
my
approaching
fate
and
you
know
the
less
guilty
a
prisoner
is
the
more
it
is
his
duty
to
die
calmly
and
even
joyfully
as
he
dies
a
martyr
come
there
s
a
dear
don
t
cry
any
more
and
tell
me
what
you
want
my
pretty
she
fell
on
her
knees
forgive
my
father
she
said
your
father
your
father
said
cornelius
astonished
yes
he
has
been
so
harsh
to
you
but
it
is
his
nature
he
is
so
to
every
one
and
you
are
not
the
only
one
whom
he
has
he
is
punished
my
dear
rosa
more
than
punished
by
the
accident
that
has
befallen
him
and
i
forgive
i
thank
you
sir
said
rosa
and
now
tell
me
oh
tell
me
can
i
do
anything
for
you
you
can
dry
your
beautiful
eyes
my
dear
child
answered
cornelius
with
a
smile
but
what
can
i
do
for
you
for
you
i
mean
a
man
who
has
only
one
hour
longer
to
live
must
be
a
great
sybarite
still
to
want
anything
my
dear
the
clergyman
whom
they
have
proposed
to
you
i
have
worshipped
god
all
my
life
i
have
worshipped
him
in
his
works
and
praised
him
in
his
decrees
i
am
at
peace
with
him
and
do
not
wish
for
a
clergyman
the
last
thought
which
occupies
my
mind
however
has
reference
to
the
glory
of
the
almighty
and
indeed
my
dear
i
should
ask
you
to
help
me
in
carrying
out
this
last
oh
mynheer
cornelius
speak
speak
exclaimed
rosa
still
bathed
in
tears
give
me
your
hand
and
promise
me
not
to
laugh
my
dear
laugh
exclaimed
rosa
frantic
with
grief
laugh
at
this
moment
do
you
not
see
my
tears
rosa
you
are
no
stranger
to
me
i
have
not
seen
much
of
you
but
that
little
is
enough
to
make
me
appreciate
your
character
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
more
fair
or
more
pure
than
you
are
and
if
from
this
moment
i
take
no
more
notice
of
you
forgive
me
it
is
only
because
on
leaving
this
world
i
do
not
wish
to
have
any
further
rosa
felt
a
shudder
creeping
over
her
frame
for
whilst
the
prisoner
pronounced
these
words
the
belfry
clock
of
the
buytenhof
struck
eleven
cornelius
understood
her
yes
yes
let
us
make
haste
he
said
you
are
right
then
taking
the
paper
with
the
three
suckers
from
his
breast
where
he
had
again
put
it
since
he
had
no
longer
any
fear
of
being
searched
he
said
my
dear
girl
i
have
been
very
fond
of
flowers
that
was
at
a
time
when
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
anything
else
to
be
loved
don
t
blush
rosa
nor
turn
away
and
even
if
i
were
making
you
a
declaration
of
love
alas
poor
dear
it
would
be
of
no
more
consequence
down
there
in
the
yard
there
is
an
instrument
of
steel
which
in
sixty
minutes
will
put
an
end
to
my
boldness
well
rosa
i
loved
flowers
dearly
and
i
have
found
or
at
least
i
believe
so
the
secret
of
the
great
black
tulip
which
it
has
been
considered
impossible
to
grow
and
for
which
as
you
know
or
may
not
know
a
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
has
been
offered
by
the
horticultural
society
of
haarlem
these
hundred
thousand
guilders
and
heaven
knows
i
do
not
regret
them
these
hundred
thousand
guilders
i
have
here
in
this
paper
for
they
are
won
by
the
three
bulbs
wrapped
up
in
it
which
you
may
take
rosa
as
i
make
you
a
present
of
mynheer
cornelius
yes
yes
rosa
you
may
take
them
you
are
not
wronging
any
one
my
child
i
am
alone
in
this
world
my
parents
are
dead
i
never
had
a
sister
or
a
brother
i
have
never
had
a
thought
of
loving
any
one
with
what
is
called
love
and
if
any
one
has
loved
me
i
have
not
known
it
however
you
see
well
rosa
that
i
am
abandoned
by
everybody
as
in
this
sad
hour
you
alone
are
with
me
in
my
prison
consoling
and
assisting
but
sir
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
well
let
us
talk
seriously
my
dear
child
those
hundred
thousand
guilders
will
be
a
nice
marriage
portion
with
your
pretty
face
you
shall
have
them
rosa
dear
rosa
and
i
ask
nothing
in
return
but
your
promise
that
you
will
marry
a
fine
young
man
whom
you
love
and
who
will
love
you
as
dearly
as
i
loved
my
flowers
don
t
interrupt
me
rosa
dear
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
the
poor
girl
was
nearly
choking
with
her
sobs
cornelius
took
her
by
the
hand
listen
to
me
he
continued
i
ll
tell
you
how
to
manage
it
go
to
dort
and
ask
butruysheim
my
gardener
for
soil
from
my
border
number
six
fill
a
deep
box
with
it
and
plant
in
it
these
three
bulbs
they
will
flower
next
may
that
is
to
say
in
seven
months
and
when
you
see
the
flower
forming
on
the
stem
be
careful
at
night
to
protect
them
from
the
wind
and
by
day
to
screen
them
from
the
sun
they
will
flower
black
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
you
are
then
to
apprise
the
president
of
the
haarlem
society
he
will
cause
the
color
of
the
flower
to
be
proved
before
a
committee
and
these
hundred
thousand
guilders
will
be
paid
to
rosa
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
now
continued
cornelius
wiping
away
a
tear
which
was
glistening
in
his
eye
and
which
was
shed
much
more
for
that
marvellous
black
tulip
which
he
was
not
to
see
than
for
the
life
which
he
was
about
to
lose
i
have
no
wish
left
except
that
the
tulip
should
be
called
rosa
barlœnsis
that
is
to
say
that
its
name
should
combine
yours
and
mine
and
as
of
course
you
do
not
understand
latin
and
might
therefore
forget
this
name
try
to
get
for
me
pencil
and
paper
that
i
may
write
it
down
for
rosa
sobbed
afresh
and
handed
to
him
a
book
bound
in
shagreen
which
bore
the
initials
what
is
this
asked
the
prisoner
alas
replied
rosa
it
is
the
bible
of
your
poor
godfather
cornelius
de
witt
from
it
he
derived
strength
to
endure
the
torture
and
to
bear
his
sentence
without
flinching
i
found
it
in
this
cell
after
the
death
of
the
martyr
and
have
preserved
it
as
a
relic
i
brought
it
to
you
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
book
must
possess
in
itself
a
divine
power
write
in
it
what
you
have
to
write
mynheer
cornelius
and
though
unfortunately
i
am
not
able
to
read
i
will
take
care
that
what
you
write
shall
be
cornelius
took
the
bible
and
kissed
it
reverently
with
what
shall
i
write
asked
cornelius
there
is
a
pencil
in
the
bible
said
rosa
this
was
the
pencil
which
john
de
witt
had
lent
to
his
brother
and
which
he
had
forgotten
to
take
away
with
him
cornelius
took
it
and
on
the
second
fly
leaf
for
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
first
was
torn
out
drawing
near
his
end
like
his
godfather
he
wrote
with
a
no
less
firm
hand
on
this
day
the
of
august
being
on
the
point
of
rendering
although
innocent
my
soul
to
god
on
the
scaffold
i
bequeath
to
rosa
gryphus
the
only
worldly
goods
which
remain
to
me
of
all
that
i
have
possessed
in
this
world
the
rest
having
been
confiscated
i
bequeath
i
say
to
rosa
gryphus
three
bulbs
which
i
am
convinced
must
produce
in
the
next
may
the
grand
black
tulip
for
which
a
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
has
been
offered
by
the
haarlem
society
requesting
that
she
may
be
paid
the
same
sum
in
my
stead
as
my
sole
heiress
under
the
only
condition
of
her
marrying
a
respectable
young
man
of
about
my
age
who
loves
her
and
whom
she
loves
and
of
her
giving
the
black
tulip
which
will
constitute
a
new
species
the
name
of
rosa
barlœnsis
that
is
to
say
hers
and
mine
combined
so
may
god
grant
me
mercy
and
to
her
health
and
long
life
cornelius
van
the
prisoner
then
giving
the
bible
to
rosa
said
alas
she
answered
i
have
already
told
you
i
can
not
cornelius
then
read
to
rosa
the
testament
that
he
had
just
made
the
agony
of
the
poor
girl
almost
overpowered
her
do
you
accept
my
conditions
asked
the
prisoner
with
a
melancholy
smile
kissing
the
trembling
hands
of
the
afflicted
girl
oh
i
don
t
know
sir
she
stammered
you
don
t
know
child
and
why
not
because
there
is
one
condition
which
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
which
i
should
have
thought
that
all
was
settled
between
you
give
me
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
as
a
marriage
portion
don
t
you
and
under
the
condition
of
my
marrying
a
man
whom
i
love
well
then
sir
this
money
can
not
belong
to
me
i
shall
never
love
any
one
neither
shall
i
and
after
having
with
difficulty
uttered
these
words
rosa
almost
swooned
away
in
the
violence
of
her
grief
cornelius
frightened
at
seeing
her
so
pale
and
sinking
was
going
to
take
her
in
his
arms
when
a
heavy
step
followed
by
other
dismal
sounds
was
heard
on
the
staircase
amidst
the
continued
barking
of
the
dog
they
are
coming
to
fetch
you
oh
god
oh
god
cried
rosa
wringing
her
hands
and
have
you
nothing
more
to
tell
me
she
fell
on
her
knees
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
became
almost
senseless
i
have
only
to
say
that
i
wish
you
to
preserve
these
bulbs
as
a
most
precious
treasure
and
carefully
to
treat
them
according
to
the
directions
i
have
given
you
do
it
for
my
sake
and
now
farewell
yes
yes
she
said
without
raising
her
head
i
will
do
anything
you
bid
me
except
marrying
she
added
in
a
low
voice
for
that
oh
that
is
impossible
for
she
then
put
the
cherished
treasure
next
her
beating
heart
the
noise
on
the
staircase
which
cornelius
and
rosa
had
heard
was
caused
by
the
recorder
who
was
coming
for
the
prisoner
he
was
followed
by
the
executioner
by
the
soldiers
who
were
to
form
the
guard
round
the
scaffold
and
by
some
curious
of
the
prison
cornelius
without
showing
any
weakness
but
likewise
without
any
bravado
received
them
rather
as
friends
than
as
persecutors
and
quietly
submitted
to
all
those
preparations
which
these
men
were
obliged
to
make
in
performance
of
their
duty
then
casting
a
glance
into
the
yard
through
the
narrow
window
of
his
cell
he
perceived
the
scaffold
and
at
twenty
paces
distant
from
it
the
gibbet
from
which
by
order
of
the
stadtholder
the
outraged
remains
of
the
two
brothers
de
witt
had
been
taken
down
when
the
moment
came
to
descend
in
order
to
follow
the
guards
cornelius
sought
with
his
eyes
the
angelic
look
of
rosa
but
he
saw
behind
the
swords
and
halberds
only
a
form
lying
outstretched
near
a
wooden
bench
and
a
deathlike
face
half
covered
with
long
golden
locks
but
rosa
whilst
falling
down
senseless
still
obeying
her
friend
had
pressed
her
hand
on
her
velvet
bodice
and
forgetting
everything
in
the
world
besides
instinctively
grasped
the
precious
deposit
which
cornelius
had
intrusted
to
her
care
leaving
the
cell
the
young
man
could
still
see
in
the
convulsively
clinched
fingers
of
rosa
the
yellowish
leaf
from
that
bible
on
which
cornelius
de
witt
had
with
such
difficulty
and
pain
written
these
few
lines
which
if
van
baerle
had
read
them
would
undoubtedly
have
been
the
saving
of
a
man
and
a
tulip
chapter
the
execution
cornelius
had
not
three
hundred
paces
to
walk
outside
the
prison
to
reach
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
the
dog
quietly
looked
at
him
whilst
he
was
passing
cornelius
even
fancied
he
saw
in
the
eyes
of
the
monster
a
certain
expression
as
it
were
of
compassion
the
dog
perhaps
knew
the
condemned
prisoners
and
only
bit
those
who
left
as
free
men
the
shorter
the
way
from
the
door
of
the
prison
to
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
the
more
fully
of
course
it
was
crowded
with
curious
people
these
were
the
same
who
not
satisfied
with
the
blood
which
they
had
shed
three
days
before
were
now
craving
for
a
new
victim
and
scarcely
had
cornelius
made
his
appearance
than
a
fierce
groan
ran
through
the
whole
street
spreading
all
over
the
yard
and
from
the
streets
which
led
to
the
scaffold
and
which
were
likewise
crowded
with
spectators
the
scaffold
indeed
looked
like
an
islet
at
the
confluence
of
several
rivers
in
the
midst
of
these
threats
groans
and
yells
cornelius
very
likely
in
order
not
to
hear
them
had
buried
himself
in
his
own
thoughts
and
what
did
he
think
of
in
his
last
melancholy
journey
neither
of
his
enemies
nor
of
his
judges
nor
of
his
executioners
he
thought
of
the
beautiful
tulips
which
he
would
see
from
heaven
above
at
ceylon
or
bengal
or
elsewhere
when
he
would
be
able
to
look
with
pity
on
this
earth
where
john
and
cornelius
de
witt
had
been
murdered
for
having
thought
too
much
of
politics
and
where
cornelius
van
baerle
was
about
to
be
murdered
for
having
thought
too
much
of
tulips
it
is
only
one
stroke
of
the
axe
said
the
philosopher
to
himself
and
my
beautiful
dream
will
begin
to
be
only
there
was
still
a
chance
just
as
it
had
happened
before
to
de
chalais
to
de
thou
and
other
slovenly
executed
people
that
the
headsman
might
inflict
more
than
one
stroke
that
is
to
say
more
than
one
martyrdom
on
the
poor
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
van
baerle
mounted
the
scaffold
not
the
less
resolutely
proud
of
having
been
the
friend
of
that
illustrious
john
and
godson
of
that
noble
cornelius
de
witt
whom
the
ruffians
who
were
now
crowding
to
witness
his
own
doom
had
torn
to
pieces
and
burnt
three
days
before
he
knelt
down
said
his
prayers
and
observed
not
without
a
feeling
of
sincere
joy
that
laying
his
head
on
the
block
and
keeping
his
eyes
open
he
would
be
able
to
his
last
moment
to
see
the
grated
window
of
the
buytenhof
at
length
the
fatal
moment
arrived
and
cornelius
placed
his
chin
on
the
cold
damp
block
but
at
this
moment
his
eyes
closed
involuntarily
to
receive
more
resolutely
the
terrible
avalanche
which
was
about
to
fall
on
his
head
and
to
engulf
his
life
a
gleam
like
that
of
lightning
passed
across
the
scaffold
it
was
the
executioner
raising
his
sword
van
baerle
bade
farewell
to
the
great
black
tulip
certain
of
awaking
in
another
world
full
of
light
and
glorious
tints
three
times
he
felt
with
a
shudder
the
cold
current
of
air
from
the
knife
near
his
neck
but
what
a
surprise
he
felt
neither
pain
nor
shock
he
saw
no
change
in
the
colour
of
the
sky
or
of
the
world
around
him
then
suddenly
van
baerle
felt
gentle
hands
raising
him
and
soon
stood
on
his
feet
again
although
trembling
a
little
he
looked
around
him
there
was
some
one
by
his
side
reading
a
large
parchment
sealed
with
a
huge
seal
of
red
wax
and
the
same
sun
yellow
and
pale
as
it
behooves
a
dutch
sun
to
be
was
shining
in
the
skies
and
the
same
grated
window
looked
down
upon
him
from
the
buytenhof
and
the
same
rabble
no
longer
yelling
but
completely
thunderstruck
were
staring
at
him
from
the
streets
below
van
baerle
began
to
be
sensible
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
his
highness
william
prince
of
orange
very
likely
afraid
that
van
baerle
s
blood
would
turn
the
scale
of
judgment
against
him
had
compassionately
taken
into
consideration
his
good
character
and
the
apparent
proofs
of
his
innocence
his
highness
accordingly
had
granted
him
his
life
cornelius
at
first
hoped
that
the
pardon
would
be
complete
and
that
he
would
be
restored
to
his
full
liberty
and
to
his
flower
borders
at
dort
but
cornelius
was
mistaken
to
use
an
expression
of
madame
de
sévigné
who
wrote
about
the
same
time
there
was
a
postscript
to
the
letter
and
the
most
important
part
of
the
letter
was
contained
in
the
postscript
in
this
postscript
william
of
orange
stadtholder
of
holland
condemned
cornelius
van
baerle
to
imprisonment
for
life
he
was
not
sufficiently
guilty
to
suffer
death
but
he
was
too
much
so
to
be
set
at
liberty
cornelius
heard
this
clause
but
the
first
feeling
of
vexation
and
disappointment
over
he
said
to
himself
never
mind
all
this
is
not
lost
yet
there
is
some
good
in
this
perpetual
imprisonment
rosa
will
be
there
and
also
my
three
bulbs
of
the
black
tulip
are
but
cornelius
forgot
that
the
seven
provinces
had
seven
prisons
one
for
each
and
that
the
board
of
the
prisoner
is
anywhere
else
less
expensive
than
at
the
hague
which
is
a
capital
his
highness
who
as
it
seems
did
not
possess
the
means
to
feed
van
baerle
at
the
hague
sent
him
to
undergo
his
perpetual
imprisonment
at
the
fortress
of
loewestein
very
near
dort
but
alas
also
very
far
from
it
for
loewestein
as
the
geographers
tell
us
is
situated
at
the
point
of
the
islet
which
is
formed
by
the
confluence
of
the
waal
and
the
meuse
opposite
gorcum
van
baerle
was
sufficiently
versed
in
the
history
of
his
country
to
know
that
the
celebrated
grotius
was
confined
in
that
castle
after
the
death
of
barneveldt
and
that
the
states
in
their
generosity
to
the
illustrious
publicist
jurist
historian
poet
and
divine
had
granted
to
him
for
his
daily
maintenance
the
sum
of
stivers
i
said
van
baerle
to
himself
i
am
worth
much
less
than
grotius
they
will
hardly
give
me
twelve
stivers
and
i
shall
live
miserably
but
never
mind
at
all
events
i
shall
then
suddenly
a
terrible
thought
struck
him
ah
he
exclaimed
how
damp
and
misty
that
part
of
the
country
is
and
the
soil
so
bad
for
the
tulips
and
then
rosa
will
not
be
at
loewestein
chapter
what
was
going
on
all
this
time
in
the
mind
of
one
of
the
spectators
whilst
cornelius
was
engaged
with
his
own
thoughts
a
coach
had
driven
up
to
the
scaffold
this
vehicle
was
for
the
prisoner
he
was
invited
to
enter
it
and
he
obeyed
his
last
look
was
towards
the
buytenhof
he
hoped
to
see
at
the
window
the
face
of
rosa
brightening
up
again
but
the
coach
was
drawn
by
good
horses
who
soon
carried
van
baerle
away
from
among
the
shouts
which
the
rabble
roared
in
honour
of
the
most
magnanimous
stadtholder
mixing
with
it
a
spice
of
abuse
against
the
brothers
de
witt
and
the
godson
of
cornelius
who
had
just
now
been
saved
from
death
this
reprieve
suggested
to
the
worthy
spectators
remarks
such
as
the
following
it
s
very
fortunate
that
we
used
such
speed
in
having
justice
done
to
that
great
villain
john
and
to
that
little
rogue
cornelius
otherwise
his
highness
might
have
snatched
them
from
us
just
as
he
has
done
this
among
all
the
spectators
whom
van
baerle
s
execution
had
attracted
to
the
buytenhof
and
whom
the
sudden
turn
of
affairs
had
disagreeably
surprised
undoubtedly
the
one
most
disappointed
was
a
certain
respectably
dressed
burgher
who
from
early
morning
had
made
such
a
good
use
of
his
feet
and
elbows
that
he
at
last
was
separated
from
the
scaffold
only
by
the
file
of
soldiers
which
surrounded
it
many
had
shown
themselves
eager
to
see
the
perfidious
blood
of
the
guilty
cornelius
flow
but
not
one
had
shown
such
a
keen
anxiety
as
the
individual
just
alluded
to
the
most
furious
had
come
to
the
buytenhof
at
daybreak
to
secure
a
better
place
but
he
outdoing
even
them
had
passed
the
night
at
the
threshold
of
the
prison
from
whence
as
we
have
already
said
he
had
advanced
to
the
very
foremost
rank
unguibus
et
rostro
that
is
to
say
coaxing
some
and
kicking
the
others
and
when
the
executioner
had
conducted
the
prisoner
to
the
scaffold
the
burgher
who
had
mounted
on
the
stone
of
the
pump
the
better
to
see
and
be
seen
made
to
the
executioner
a
sign
which
meant
it
s
a
bargain
isn
t
it
the
executioner
answered
by
another
sign
which
was
meant
to
say
be
quiet
it
s
all
this
burgher
was
no
other
than
mynheer
isaac
boxtel
who
since
the
arrest
of
cornelius
had
come
to
the
hague
to
try
if
he
could
not
get
hold
of
the
three
bulbs
of
the
black
tulip
boxtel
had
at
first
tried
to
gain
over
gryphus
to
his
interest
but
the
jailer
had
not
only
the
snarling
fierceness
but
likewise
the
fidelity
of
a
dog
he
had
therefore
bristled
up
at
boxtel
s
hatred
whom
he
had
suspected
to
be
a
warm
friend
of
the
prisoner
making
trifling
inquiries
to
contrive
with
the
more
certainty
some
means
of
escape
for
him
thus
to
the
very
first
proposals
which
boxtel
made
to
gryphus
to
filch
the
bulbs
which
cornelius
van
baerle
must
be
supposed
to
conceal
if
not
in
his
breast
at
least
in
some
corner
of
his
cell
the
surly
jailer
had
only
answered
by
kicking
mynheer
isaac
out
and
setting
the
dog
at
him
the
piece
which
the
mastiff
had
torn
from
his
hose
did
not
discourage
boxtel
he
came
back
to
the
charge
but
this
time
gryphus
was
in
bed
feverish
and
with
a
broken
arm
he
therefore
was
not
able
to
admit
the
petitioner
who
then
addressed
himself
to
rosa
offering
to
buy
her
a
of
pure
gold
if
she
would
get
the
bulbs
for
him
on
this
the
generous
girl
although
not
yet
knowing
the
value
of
the
object
of
the
robbery
which
was
to
be
so
well
remunerated
had
directed
the
tempter
to
the
executioner
as
the
heir
of
the
prisoner
in
the
meanwhile
the
sentence
had
been
pronounced
thus
isaac
had
no
more
time
to
bribe
any
one
he
therefore
clung
to
the
idea
which
rosa
had
suggested
he
went
to
the
executioner
isaac
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
cornelius
would
die
with
the
bulbs
on
his
heart
but
there
were
two
things
which
boxtel
did
not
calculate
upon
rosa
that
is
to
say
love
william
of
orange
that
is
to
say
clemency
but
for
rosa
and
william
the
calculations
of
the
envious
neighbour
would
have
been
correct
but
for
william
cornelius
would
have
died
but
for
rosa
cornelius
would
have
died
with
his
bulbs
on
his
heart
mynheer
boxtel
went
to
the
headsman
to
whom
he
gave
himself
out
as
a
great
friend
of
the
condemned
man
and
from
whom
he
bought
all
the
clothes
of
the
dead
man
that
was
to
be
for
one
hundred
guilders
rather
an
exorbitant
sum
as
he
engaged
to
leave
all
the
trinkets
of
gold
and
silver
to
the
executioner
but
what
was
the
sum
of
a
hundred
guilders
to
a
man
who
was
all
but
sure
to
buy
with
it
the
prize
of
the
haarlem
society
it
was
money
lent
at
a
thousand
per
which
as
nobody
will
deny
was
a
very
handsome
investment
the
headsman
on
the
other
hand
had
scarcely
anything
to
do
to
earn
his
hundred
guilders
he
needed
only
as
soon
as
the
execution
was
over
to
allow
mynheer
boxtel
to
ascend
the
scaffold
with
his
servants
to
remove
the
inanimate
remains
of
his
friend
the
thing
was
moreover
quite
customary
among
the
faithful
brethren
when
one
of
their
masters
died
a
public
death
in
the
yard
of
the
buytenhof
a
fanatic
like
cornelius
might
very
easily
have
found
another
fanatic
who
would
give
a
hundred
guilders
for
his
remains
the
executioner
also
readily
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
making
only
one
condition
that
of
being
paid
in
advance
boxtel
like
the
people
who
enter
a
show
at
a
fair
might
be
disappointed
and
refuse
to
pay
on
going
out
boxtel
paid
in
advance
and
waited
after
this
the
reader
may
imagine
how
excited
boxtel
was
with
what
anxiety
he
watched
the
guards
the
recorder
and
the
executioner
and
with
what
intense
interest
he
surveyed
the
movements
of
van
baerle
how
would
he
place
himself
on
the
block
how
would
he
fall
and
would
he
not
in
falling
crush
those
inestimable
bulbs
had
not
he
at
least
taken
care
to
enclose
them
in
a
golden
box
as
gold
is
the
hardest
of
all
metals
every
trifling
delay
irritated
him
why
did
that
stupid
executioner
thus
lose
time
in
brandishing
his
sword
over
the
head
of
cornelius
instead
of
cutting
that
head
off
but
when
he
saw
the
recorder
take
the
hand
of
the
condemned
and
raise
him
whilst
drawing
forth
the
parchment
from
his
pocket
when
he
heard
the
pardon
of
the
stadtholder
publicly
read
out
then
boxtel
was
no
more
like
a
human
being
the
rage
and
malice
of
the
tiger
of
the
hyena
and
of
the
serpent
glistened
in
his
eyes
and
vented
itself
in
his
yell
and
his
movements
had
he
been
able
to
get
at
van
baerle
he
would
have
pounced
upon
him
and
strangled
him
and
so
then
cornelius
was
to
live
and
was
to
go
with
him
to
loewestein
and
thither
to
his
prison
he
would
take
with
him
his
bulbs
and
perhaps
he
would
even
find
a
garden
where
the
black
tulip
would
flower
for
him
boxtel
quite
overcome
by
his
frenzy
fell
from
the
stone
upon
some
orangemen
who
like
him
were
sorely
vexed
at
the
turn
which
affairs
had
taken
they
mistaking
the
frantic
cries
of
mynheer
isaac
for
demonstrations
of
joy
began
to
belabour
him
with
kicks
and
cuffs
such
as
could
not
have
been
administered
in
better
style
by
any
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
blows
were
however
nothing
to
him
he
wanted
to
run
after
the
coach
which
was
carrying
away
cornelius
with
his
bulbs
but
in
his
hurry
he
overlooked
a
in
his
way
stumbled
lost
his
centre
of
gravity
rolled
over
to
a
distance
of
some
yards
and
only
rose
again
bruised
and
begrimed
after
the
whole
rabble
of
the
hague
with
their
muddy
feet
had
passed
over
him
one
would
think
that
this
was
enough
for
one
day
but
mynheer
boxtel
did
not
seem
to
think
so
as
in
addition
to
having
his
clothes
torn
his
back
bruised
and
his
hands
scratched
he
inflicted
upon
himself
the
further
punishment
of
tearing
out
his
hair
by
handfuls
as
an
offering
to
that
goddess
of
envy
who
as
mythology
teaches
us
wears
a
of
serpents
chapter
the
pigeons
of
dort
it
was
indeed
in
itself
a
great
honour
for
cornelius
van
baerle
to
be
confined
in
the
same
prison
which
had
once
received
the
learned
master
grotius
but
on
arriving
at
the
prison
he
met
with
an
honour
even
greater
as
chance
would
have
it
the
cell
formerly
inhabited
by
the
illustrious
barneveldt
happened
to
be
vacant
when
the
clemency
of
the
prince
of
orange
sent
the
van
baerle
there
the
cell
had
a
very
bad
character
at
the
castle
since
the
time
when
grotius
by
means
of
the
device
of
his
wife
made
escape
from
it
in
that
famous
which
the
jailers
forgot
to
examine
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
to
van
baerle
an
auspicious
omen
that
this
very
cell
was
assigned
to
him
for
according
to
his
ideas
a
jailer
ought
never
to
have
given
to
a
second
pigeon
the
cage
from
which
the
first
had
so
easily
flown
the
cell
had
an
historical
character
we
will
only
state
here
that
with
the
exception
of
an
alcove
which
was
contrived
there
for
the
use
of
madame
grotius
it
differed
in
no
respect
from
the
other
cells
of
the
prison
only
perhaps
it
was
a
little
higher
and
had
a
splendid
view
from
the
grated
window
cornelius
felt
himself
perfectly
indifferent
as
to
the
place
where
he
had
to
lead
an
existence
which
was
little
more
than
vegetation
there
were
only
two
things
now
for
which
he
cared
and
the
possession
of
which
was
a
happiness
enjoyed
only
in
imagination
a
flower
and
a
woman
both
of
them
as
he
conceived
lost
to
him
for
ever
fortunately
the
good
doctor
was
mistaken
in
his
prison
cell
the
most
adventurous
life
which
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
any
was
reserved
for
him
one
morning
whilst
at
his
window
inhaling
the
fresh
air
which
came
from
the
river
and
casting
a
longing
look
to
the
windmills
of
his
dear
old
city
dort
which
were
looming
in
the
distance
behind
a
forest
of
chimneys
he
saw
flocks
of
pigeons
coming
from
that
quarter
to
perch
fluttering
on
the
pointed
gables
of
loewestein
these
pigeons
van
baerle
said
to
himself
are
coming
from
dort
and
consequently
may
return
there
by
fastening
a
little
note
to
the
wing
of
one
of
these
pigeons
one
might
have
a
chance
to
send
a
message
there
then
after
a
few
moments
consideration
he
exclaimed
i
will
do
a
man
grows
very
patient
who
is
years
of
age
and
condemned
to
a
prison
for
life
that
is
to
say
to
something
like
or
thousand
days
of
captivity
van
baerle
from
whose
thoughts
the
three
bulbs
were
never
absent
made
a
snare
for
catching
the
pigeons
baiting
the
birds
with
all
the
resources
of
his
kitchen
such
as
it
was
for
eight
slivers
sixpence
english
a
day
and
after
a
month
of
unsuccessful
attempts
he
at
last
caught
a
female
bird
it
cost
him
two
more
months
to
catch
a
male
bird
he
then
shut
them
up
together
and
having
about
the
beginning
of
the
year
obtained
some
eggs
from
them
he
released
the
female
which
leaving
the
male
behind
to
hatch
the
eggs
in
her
stead
flew
joyously
to
dort
with
the
note
under
her
wing
she
returned
in
the
evening
she
had
preserved
the
note
thus
it
went
on
for
fifteen
days
at
first
to
the
disappointment
and
then
to
the
great
grief
of
van
baerle
on
the
sixteenth
day
at
last
she
came
back
without
it
van
baerle
had
addressed
it
to
his
nurse
the
old
frisian
woman
and
implored
any
charitable
soul
who
might
find
it
to
convey
it
to
her
as
safely
and
as
speedily
as
possible
in
this
letter
there
was
a
little
note
enclosed
for
rosa
van
baerle
s
nurse
had
received
the
letter
in
the
following
way
leaving
dort
mynheer
isaac
boxtel
had
abandoned
not
only
his
house
his
servants
his
observatory
and
his
telescope
but
also
his
pigeons
the
servant
having
been
left
without
wages
first
lived
on
his
little
savings
and
then
on
his
master
s
pigeons
seeing
this
the
pigeons
emigrated
from
the
roof
of
isaac
boxtel
to
that
of
cornelius
van
baerle
the
nurse
was
a
woman
who
could
not
live
without
something
to
love
she
conceived
an
affection
for
the
pigeons
which
had
thrown
themselves
on
her
hospitality
and
when
boxtel
s
servant
reclaimed
them
with
culinary
intentions
having
eaten
the
first
fifteen
already
and
now
wishing
to
eat
the
other
fifteen
she
offered
to
buy
them
from
him
for
a
consideration
of
six
stivers
per
head
this
being
just
double
their
value
the
man
was
very
glad
to
close
the
bargain
and
the
nurse
found
herself
in
undisputed
possession
of
the
pigeons
of
her
master
s
envious
neighbour
in
the
course
of
their
wanderings
these
pigeons
with
others
visited
the
hague
loewestein
and
rotterdam
seeking
variety
doubtless
in
the
flavour
of
their
wheat
or
hempseed
chance
or
rather
god
for
we
can
see
the
hand
of
god
in
everything
had
willed
that
cornelius
van
baerle
should
happen
to
hit
upon
one
of
these
very
pigeons
therefore
if
the
envious
wretch
had
not
left
dort
to
follow
his
rival
to
the
hague
in
the
first
place
and
then
to
gorcum
or
to
loewestein
for
the
two
places
are
separated
only
by
the
confluence
of
the
waal
and
the
meuse
van
baerle
s
letter
would
have
fallen
into
his
hands
and
not
the
nurse
s
in
which
event
the
poor
prisoner
like
the
raven
of
the
roman
cobbler
would
have
thrown
away
his
time
his
trouble
and
instead
of
having
to
relate
the
series
of
exciting
events
which
are
about
to
flow
from
beneath
our
pen
like
the
varied
hues
of
a
many
coloured
tapestry
we
should
have
naught
to
describe
but
a
weary
waste
of
days
dull
and
melancholy
and
gloomy
as
night
s
dark
mantle
the
note
as
we
have
said
had
reached
van
baerle
s
nurse
and
also
it
came
to
pass
that
one
evening
in
the
beginning
of
february
just
when
the
stars
were
beginning
to
twinkle
cornelius
heard
on
the
staircase
of
the
little
turret
a
voice
which
thrilled
through
him
he
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
listened
it
was
the
sweet
harmonious
voice
of
rosa
let
us
confess
it
cornelius
was
not
so
stupefied
with
surprise
or
so
beyond
himself
with
joy
as
he
would
have
been
but
for
the
pigeon
which
in
answer
to
his
letter
had
brought
back
hope
to
him
under
her
empty
wing
and
knowing
rosa
he
expected
if
the
note
had
ever
reached
her
to
hear
of
her
whom
he
loved
and
also
of
his
three
darling
bulbs
he
rose
listened
once
more
and
bent
forward
towards
the
door
yes
they
were
indeed
the
accents
which
had
fallen
so
sweetly
on
his
heart
at
the
hague
the
question
now
was
whether
rosa
who
had
made
the
journey
from
the
hague
to
loewestein
and
who
cornelius
did
not
understand
how
had
succeeded
even
in
penetrating
into
the
prison
would
also
be
fortunate
enough
in
penetrating
to
the
prisoner
himself
whilst
cornelius
debating
this
point
within
himself
was
building
all
sorts
of
castles
in
the
air
and
was
struggling
between
hope
and
fear
the
shutter
of
the
grating
in
the
door
opened
and
rosa
beaming
with
joy
and
beautiful
in
her
pretty
national
costume
but
still
more
beautiful
from
the
grief
which
for
the
last
five
months
had
blanched
her
cheeks
pressed
her
little
face
against
the
wire
grating
of
the
window
saying
to
him
oh
sir
sir
here
i
am
cornelius
stretched
out
his
arms
and
looking
to
heaven
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
oh
rosa
rosa
hush
let
us
speak
low
my
father
follows
on
my
heels
said
the
girl
your
father
yes
he
is
in
the
courtyard
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
receiving
the
instructions
of
the
governor
he
will
presently
come
the
instructions
of
the
governor
listen
to
me
i
ll
try
to
tell
you
all
in
a
few
words
the
stadtholder
has
a
one
league
distant
from
leyden
properly
speaking
a
kind
of
large
dairy
and
my
aunt
who
was
his
nurse
has
the
management
of
it
as
soon
as
i
received
your
letter
which
alas
i
could
not
read
myself
but
which
your
housekeeper
read
to
me
i
hastened
to
my
aunt
there
i
remained
until
the
prince
should
come
to
the
dairy
and
when
he
came
i
asked
him
as
a
favour
to
allow
my
father
to
exchange
his
post
at
the
prison
of
the
hague
with
the
jailer
of
the
fortress
of
loewestein
the
prince
could
not
have
suspected
my
object
had
he
known
it
he
would
have
refused
my
request
but
as
it
is
he
granted
and
so
you
are
here
as
you
and
thus
i
shall
see
you
every
day
as
often
as
i
can
manage
oh
rosa
my
beautiful
rosa
do
you
love
me
a
little
a
little
she
said
you
make
no
great
pretensions
mynheer
cornelius
tenderly
stretched
out
his
hands
towards
her
but
they
were
only
able
to
touch
each
other
with
the
tips
of
their
fingers
through
the
wire
grating
here
is
my
father
said
she
rosa
then
abruptly
drew
back
from
the
door
and
ran
to
meet
old
gryphus
who
made
his
appearance
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
chapter
the
little
grated
window
gryphus
was
followed
by
the
mastiff
the
turnkey
took
the
animal
round
the
jail
so
that
if
needs
be
he
might
recognize
the
prisoners
father
said
rosa
here
is
the
famous
prison
from
which
mynheer
grotius
escaped
you
know
mynheer
grotius
oh
yes
that
rogue
grotius
a
friend
of
that
villain
barneveldt
whom
i
saw
executed
when
i
was
a
child
ah
so
grotius
and
that
s
the
chamber
from
which
he
escaped
well
i
ll
answer
for
it
that
no
one
shall
escape
after
him
in
my
and
thus
opening
the
door
he
began
in
the
dark
to
talk
to
the
prisoner
the
dog
on
his
part
went
up
to
the
prisoner
and
growling
smelled
about
his
legs
just
as
though
to
ask
him
what
right
he
had
still
to
be
alive
after
having
left
the
prison
in
the
company
of
the
recorder
and
the
executioner
but
the
fair
rosa
called
him
to
her
side
well
my
master
said
gryphus
holding
up
his
lantern
to
throw
a
little
light
around
you
see
in
me
your
new
jailer
i
am
head
turnkey
and
have
all
the
cells
under
my
care
i
am
not
vicious
but
i
m
not
to
be
trifled
with
as
far
as
discipline
my
good
master
gryphus
i
know
you
perfectly
well
said
the
prisoner
approaching
within
the
circle
of
light
cast
around
by
the
lantern
halloa
that
s
you
mynheer
van
baerle
said
gryphus
that
s
you
well
i
declare
it
s
astonishing
how
people
do
oh
yes
and
it
s
really
a
great
pleasure
to
me
good
master
gryphus
to
see
that
your
arm
is
doing
well
as
you
are
able
to
hold
your
lantern
with
gryphus
knitted
his
brow
now
that
s
just
it
he
said
people
always
make
blunders
in
politics
his
highness
has
granted
you
your
life
i
m
sure
i
should
never
have
done
don
t
say
so
replied
cornelius
why
not
because
you
are
the
very
man
to
conspire
again
you
learned
people
have
dealings
with
the
nonsense
master
gryphus
are
you
dissatisfied
with
the
manner
in
which
i
have
set
your
arm
or
with
the
price
that
i
asked
you
said
cornelius
laughing
on
the
contrary
growled
the
jailer
you
have
set
it
only
too
well
there
is
some
witchcraft
in
this
after
six
weeks
i
was
able
to
use
it
as
if
nothing
had
happened
so
much
so
that
the
doctor
of
the
buytenhof
who
knows
his
trade
well
wanted
to
break
it
again
to
set
it
in
the
regular
way
and
promised
me
that
i
should
have
my
blessed
three
months
for
my
money
before
i
should
be
able
to
move
and
you
did
not
want
that
i
said
nay
as
long
as
i
can
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
that
arm
gryphus
was
a
roman
catholic
i
laugh
at
the
but
if
you
laugh
at
the
devil
master
gryphus
you
ought
with
so
much
more
reason
to
laugh
at
learned
ah
learned
people
learned
people
why
i
would
rather
have
to
guard
ten
soldiers
than
one
scholar
the
soldiers
smoke
guzzle
and
get
drunk
they
are
gentle
as
lambs
if
you
only
give
them
brandy
or
moselle
but
scholars
and
drink
smoke
and
fuddle
ah
yes
that
s
altogether
different
they
keep
sober
spend
nothing
and
have
their
heads
always
clear
to
make
conspiracies
but
i
tell
you
at
the
very
outset
it
won
t
be
such
an
easy
matter
for
you
to
conspire
first
of
all
you
will
have
no
books
no
paper
and
no
conjuring
book
it
s
books
that
helped
mynheer
grotius
to
get
i
assure
you
master
gryphus
replied
van
baerle
that
if
i
have
entertained
the
idea
of
escaping
i
most
decidedly
have
it
no
well
well
said
gryphus
just
look
sharp
that
s
what
i
shall
do
also
but
for
all
that
i
say
his
highness
has
made
a
great
not
to
have
cut
off
my
head
thank
you
master
just
so
look
whether
the
mynheer
de
witt
don
t
keep
very
quiet
that
s
very
shocking
what
you
say
now
master
gryphus
cried
van
baerle
turning
away
his
head
to
conceal
his
disgust
you
forget
that
one
of
those
unfortunate
gentlemen
was
my
friend
and
the
other
my
second
yes
but
i
also
remember
that
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
was
a
conspirator
and
moreover
i
am
speaking
from
christian
oh
indeed
explain
that
a
little
to
me
my
good
master
gryphus
i
do
not
quite
understand
well
then
if
you
had
remained
on
the
block
of
master
harbruck
what
you
would
not
suffer
any
longer
whereas
i
will
not
disguise
it
from
you
i
shall
lead
you
a
sad
life
of
thank
you
for
the
promise
master
and
whilst
the
prisoner
smiled
ironically
at
the
old
jailer
rosa
from
the
outside
answered
by
a
bright
smile
which
carried
sweet
consolation
to
the
heart
of
van
baerle
gryphus
stepped
towards
the
window
it
was
still
light
enough
to
see
although
indistinctly
through
the
gray
haze
of
the
evening
the
vast
expanse
of
the
horizon
what
view
has
one
from
here
asked
gryphus
why
a
very
fine
and
pleasant
one
said
cornelius
looking
at
rosa
yes
yes
too
much
of
a
view
too
and
at
this
moment
the
two
pigeons
scared
by
the
sight
and
especially
by
the
voice
of
the
stranger
left
their
nest
and
disappeared
quite
frightened
in
the
evening
mist
halloa
what
s
this
cried
gryphus
my
pigeons
answered
cornelius
your
pigeons
cried
the
jailer
your
pigeons
has
a
prisoner
anything
of
his
own
why
then
said
cornelius
the
pigeons
which
a
merciful
father
in
heaven
has
lent
to
so
here
we
have
a
breach
of
the
rules
already
replied
gryphus
pigeons
ah
young
man
young
man
i
ll
tell
you
one
thing
that
before
is
over
your
pigeons
will
boil
in
my
first
of
all
you
should
catch
them
master
gryphus
you
won
t
allow
these
pigeons
to
be
mine
well
i
vow
they
are
even
less
yours
than
omittance
is
no
acquittance
growled
the
jailer
and
i
shall
certainly
wring
their
necks
before
hours
are
over
you
may
be
sure
of
whilst
giving
utterance
to
this
promise
gryphus
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
examine
the
nest
this
gave
van
baerle
time
to
run
to
the
door
and
squeeze
the
hand
of
rosa
who
whispered
to
him
at
nine
o
clock
this
gryphus
quite
taken
up
with
the
desire
of
catching
the
pigeons
next
day
as
he
had
promised
he
would
do
saw
and
heard
nothing
of
this
short
interlude
and
after
having
closed
the
window
he
took
the
arm
of
his
daughter
left
the
cell
turned
the
key
twice
drew
the
bolts
and
went
off
to
make
the
same
kind
promise
to
the
other
prisoners
he
had
scarcely
withdrawn
when
cornelius
went
to
the
door
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
and
as
soon
as
they
had
died
away
he
ran
to
the
window
and
completely
demolished
the
nest
of
the
pigeons
rather
than
expose
them
to
the
tender
mercies
of
his
bullying
jailer
he
drove
away
for
ever
those
gentle
messengers
to
whom
he
owed
the
happiness
of
having
seen
rosa
again
this
visit
of
the
jailer
his
brutal
threats
and
the
gloomy
prospect
of
the
harshness
with
which
as
he
had
before
experienced
gryphus
watched
his
prisoners
all
this
was
unable
to
extinguish
in
cornelius
the
sweet
thoughts
and
especially
the
sweet
hope
which
the
presence
of
rosa
had
reawakened
in
his
heart
he
waited
eagerly
to
hear
the
clock
of
the
tower
of
loewestein
strike
nine
the
last
chime
was
still
vibrating
through
the
air
when
cornelius
heard
on
the
staircase
the
light
step
and
the
rustle
of
the
flowing
dress
of
the
fair
frisian
maid
and
soon
after
a
light
appeared
at
the
little
grated
window
in
the
door
on
which
the
prisoner
fixed
his
earnest
gaze
the
shutter
opened
on
the
outside
here
i
am
said
rosa
out
of
breath
from
running
up
the
stairs
here
i
oh
my
good
you
are
then
glad
to
see
me
can
you
ask
but
how
did
you
contrive
to
get
here
tell
now
listen
to
me
my
father
falls
asleep
every
evening
almost
immediately
after
his
supper
i
then
make
him
lie
down
a
little
stupefied
with
his
gin
don
t
say
anything
about
it
because
thanks
to
this
nap
i
shall
be
able
to
come
every
evening
and
chat
for
an
hour
with
oh
i
thank
you
rosa
dear
saying
these
words
cornelius
put
his
face
so
near
the
little
window
that
rosa
withdrew
hers
i
have
brought
back
to
you
your
cornelius
s
heart
leaped
with
joy
he
had
not
yet
dared
to
ask
rosa
what
she
had
done
with
the
precious
treasure
which
he
had
intrusted
to
her
oh
you
have
preserved
them
then
did
you
not
give
them
to
me
as
a
thing
which
was
dear
to
you
yes
but
as
i
have
given
them
to
you
it
seems
to
me
that
they
belong
to
they
would
have
belonged
to
me
after
your
death
but
fortunately
you
are
alive
now
oh
how
i
blessed
his
highness
in
my
heart
if
god
grants
to
him
all
the
happiness
that
i
have
wished
him
certainly
prince
william
will
be
the
happiest
man
on
earth
when
i
looked
at
the
bible
of
your
godfather
cornelius
i
was
resolved
to
bring
back
to
you
your
bulbs
only
i
did
not
know
how
to
accomplish
it
i
had
however
already
formed
the
plan
of
going
to
the
stadtholder
to
ask
from
him
for
my
father
the
appointment
of
jailer
of
loewestein
when
your
housekeeper
brought
me
your
letter
oh
how
we
wept
together
but
your
letter
only
confirmed
me
the
more
in
my
resolution
i
then
left
for
leyden
and
the
rest
you
what
my
dear
rosa
you
thought
even
before
receiving
my
letter
of
coming
to
meet
me
again
if
i
thought
of
it
said
rosa
allowing
her
love
to
get
the
better
of
her
bashfulness
i
thought
of
nothing
and
saying
these
words
rosa
looked
so
exceedingly
pretty
that
for
the
second
time
cornelius
placed
his
forehead
and
lips
against
the
wire
grating
of
course
we
must
presume
with
the
laudable
desire
to
thank
the
young
lady
rosa
however
drew
back
as
before
in
truth
she
said
with
that
coquetry
which
somehow
or
other
is
in
the
heart
of
every
young
girl
i
have
often
been
sorry
that
i
am
not
able
to
read
but
never
so
much
so
as
when
your
housekeeper
brought
me
your
letter
i
kept
the
paper
in
my
hands
which
spoke
to
other
people
and
which
was
dumb
to
poor
stupid
so
you
have
often
regretted
not
being
able
to
read
said
cornelius
i
should
just
like
to
know
on
what
troth
she
said
laughing
to
read
all
the
letters
which
were
written
to
oh
you
received
letters
rosa
by
but
who
wrote
to
you
who
why
in
the
first
place
all
the
students
who
passed
over
the
buytenhof
all
the
officers
who
went
to
parade
all
the
clerks
and
even
the
merchants
who
saw
me
at
my
little
and
what
did
you
do
with
all
these
notes
my
dear
rosa
formerly
she
answered
i
got
some
friend
to
read
them
to
me
which
was
capital
fun
but
since
a
certain
time
well
what
use
is
it
to
attend
to
all
this
nonsense
since
a
certain
time
i
have
burnt
since
a
certain
time
exclaimed
cornelius
with
a
look
beaming
with
love
and
joy
rosa
cast
down
her
eyes
blushing
in
her
sweet
confusion
she
did
not
observe
the
lips
of
cornelius
which
alas
only
met
the
cold
yet
in
spite
of
this
obstacle
they
communicated
to
the
lips
of
the
young
girl
the
glowing
breath
of
the
most
tender
kiss
at
this
sudden
outburst
of
tenderness
rosa
grew
very
pale
perhaps
paler
than
she
had
been
on
the
day
of
the
execution
she
uttered
a
plaintive
sob
closed
her
fine
eyes
and
fled
trying
in
vain
to
still
the
beating
of
her
heart
and
thus
cornelius
was
again
alone
rosa
had
fled
so
precipitately
that
she
completely
forgot
to
return
to
cornelius
the
three
bulbs
of
the
black
tulip
chapter
master
and
pupil
the
worthy
master
gryphus
as
the
reader
may
have
seen
was
far
from
sharing
the
kindly
feeling
of
his
daughter
for
the
godson
of
cornelius
de
witt
there
being
only
five
prisoners
at
loewestein
the
post
of
turnkey
was
not
a
very
onerous
one
but
rather
a
sort
of
sinecure
given
after
a
long
period
of
service
but
the
worthy
jailer
in
his
zeal
had
magnified
with
all
the
power
of
his
imagination
the
importance
of
his
office
to
him
cornelius
had
swelled
to
the
gigantic
proportions
of
a
criminal
of
the
first
order
he
looked
upon
him
therefore
as
the
most
dangerous
of
all
his
prisoners
he
watched
all
his
steps
and
always
spoke
to
him
with
an
angry
countenance
punishing
him
for
what
he
called
his
dreadful
rebellion
against
such
a
clement
prince
as
the
stadtholder
three
times
a
day
he
entered
van
baerle
s
cell
expecting
to
find
him
trespassing
but
cornelius
had
ceased
to
correspond
since
his
correspondent
was
at
hand
it
is
even
probable
that
if
cornelius
had
obtained
his
full
liberty
with
permission
to
go
wherever
he
liked
the
prison
with
rosa
and
his
bulbs
would
have
appeared
to
him
preferable
to
any
other
habitation
in
the
world
without
rosa
and
his
bulbs
rosa
in
fact
had
promised
to
come
and
see
him
every
evening
and
from
the
first
evening
she
had
kept
her
word
on
the
following
evening
she
went
up
as
before
with
the
same
mysteriousness
and
the
same
precaution
only
she
had
this
time
resolved
within
herself
not
to
approach
too
near
the
grating
in
order
however
to
engage
van
baerle
in
a
conversation
from
the
very
first
which
would
seriously
occupy
his
attention
she
tendered
to
him
through
the
grating
the
three
bulbs
which
were
still
wrapped
up
in
the
same
paper
but
to
the
great
astonishment
of
rosa
van
baerle
pushed
back
her
white
hand
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
the
young
man
had
been
considering
about
the
matter
listen
to
me
he
said
i
think
we
should
risk
too
much
by
embarking
our
whole
fortune
in
one
ship
only
think
my
dear
rosa
that
the
question
is
to
carry
out
an
enterprise
which
until
now
has
been
considered
impossible
namely
that
of
making
the
great
black
tulip
flower
let
us
therefore
take
every
possible
precaution
so
that
in
case
of
a
failure
we
may
not
have
anything
to
reproach
ourselves
with
i
will
now
tell
you
the
way
i
have
traced
out
for
rosa
was
all
attention
to
what
he
would
say
much
more
on
account
of
the
importance
which
the
unfortunate
attached
to
it
than
that
she
felt
interested
in
the
matter
herself
i
will
explain
to
you
rosa
he
said
i
dare
say
you
have
in
this
fortress
a
small
garden
or
some
courtyard
or
if
not
that
at
least
some
we
have
a
very
fine
garden
said
rosa
it
runs
along
the
edge
of
the
waal
and
is
full
of
fine
old
could
you
bring
me
some
soil
from
the
garden
that
i
may
judge
i
will
do
so
take
some
from
a
sunny
spot
and
some
from
a
shady
so
that
i
may
judge
of
its
properties
in
a
dry
and
in
a
moist
be
assured
i
after
having
chosen
the
soil
and
if
it
be
necessary
modified
it
we
will
divide
our
three
bulbs
you
will
take
one
and
plant
it
on
the
day
that
i
will
tell
you
in
the
soil
chosen
by
me
it
is
sure
to
flower
if
you
tend
it
according
to
my
i
will
not
lose
sight
of
it
for
a
you
will
give
me
another
which
i
will
try
to
grow
here
in
my
cell
and
which
will
help
me
to
beguile
those
long
weary
hours
when
i
can
not
see
you
i
confess
to
you
i
have
very
little
hope
for
the
latter
one
and
i
look
beforehand
on
this
unfortunate
bulb
as
sacrificed
to
my
selfishness
however
the
sun
sometimes
visits
me
i
will
besides
try
to
convert
everything
into
an
artificial
help
even
the
heat
and
the
ashes
of
my
pipe
and
lastly
we
or
rather
you
will
keep
in
reserve
the
third
sucker
as
our
last
resource
in
case
our
first
two
experiments
should
prove
a
failure
in
this
manner
my
dear
rosa
it
is
impossible
that
we
should
not
succeed
in
gaining
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
for
your
marriage
portion
and
how
dearly
shall
we
enjoy
that
supreme
happiness
of
seeing
our
work
brought
to
a
successful
issue
i
know
it
all
now
said
rosa
i
will
bring
you
the
soil
and
you
will
choose
it
for
your
bulb
and
for
mine
as
to
that
in
which
yours
is
to
grow
i
shall
have
several
journeys
to
convey
it
to
you
as
i
can
not
bring
much
at
a
there
is
no
hurry
for
it
dear
rosa
our
tulips
need
not
be
put
into
the
ground
for
a
month
at
least
so
you
see
we
have
plenty
of
time
before
us
only
i
hope
that
in
planting
your
bulb
you
will
strictly
follow
all
my
i
promise
you
i
and
when
you
have
once
planted
it
you
will
communicate
to
me
all
the
circumstances
which
may
interest
our
nursling
such
as
change
of
weather
footprints
on
the
walks
or
footprints
in
the
borders
you
will
listen
at
night
whether
our
garden
is
not
resorted
to
by
cats
a
couple
of
those
untoward
animals
laid
waste
two
of
my
borders
at
i
will
on
moonlight
nights
have
you
ever
looked
at
your
garden
my
dear
child
the
window
of
my
overlooks
well
on
moonlight
nights
you
will
observe
whether
any
rats
come
out
from
the
holes
in
the
wall
the
rats
are
most
mischievous
by
their
gnawing
everything
and
i
have
heard
unfortunate
complain
most
bitterly
of
noah
for
having
put
a
couple
of
rats
in
the
i
will
observe
and
if
there
are
cats
or
rats
you
will
apprise
me
of
it
that
s
right
and
moreover
van
baerle
having
become
mistrustful
in
his
captivity
continued
there
is
an
animal
much
more
to
be
feared
than
even
the
cat
or
the
what
animal
man
you
comprehend
my
dear
rosa
a
man
may
steal
a
guilder
and
risk
the
prison
for
such
a
trifle
and
consequently
it
is
much
more
likely
that
some
one
might
steal
a
hundred
thousand
no
one
ever
enters
the
garden
but
thank
you
thank
you
my
dear
rosa
all
the
joy
of
my
life
has
still
to
come
from
and
as
the
lips
of
van
baerle
approached
the
grating
with
the
same
ardor
as
the
day
before
and
as
moreover
the
hour
for
retiring
had
struck
rosa
drew
back
her
head
and
stretched
out
her
hand
in
this
pretty
little
hand
of
which
the
coquettish
damsel
was
particularly
proud
was
the
bulb
cornelius
kissed
most
tenderly
the
tips
of
her
fingers
did
he
do
so
because
the
hand
kept
one
of
the
bulbs
of
the
great
black
tulip
or
because
this
hand
was
rosa
s
we
shall
leave
this
point
to
the
decision
of
wiser
heads
than
ours
rosa
withdrew
with
the
other
two
suckers
pressing
them
to
her
heart
did
she
press
them
to
her
heart
because
they
were
the
bulbs
of
the
great
black
tulip
or
because
she
had
them
from
cornelius
this
point
we
believe
might
be
more
readily
decided
than
the
other
however
that
may
have
been
from
that
moment
life
became
sweet
and
again
full
of
interest
to
the
prisoner
rosa
as
we
have
seen
had
returned
to
him
one
of
the
suckers
every
evening
she
brought
to
him
handful
by
handful
a
quantity
of
soil
from
that
part
of
the
garden
which
he
had
found
to
be
the
best
and
which
indeed
was
excellent
a
large
jug
which
cornelius
had
skilfully
broken
did
service
as
a
he
half
filled
it
and
mixed
the
earth
of
the
garden
with
a
small
portion
of
dried
river
mud
a
mixture
which
formed
an
excellent
soil
then
at
the
beginning
of
april
he
planted
his
first
sucker
in
that
jug
not
a
day
passed
on
which
rosa
did
not
come
to
have
her
chat
with
cornelius
the
tulips
concerning
whose
cultivation
rosa
was
taught
all
the
mysteries
of
the
art
formed
the
principal
topic
of
the
conversation
but
interesting
as
the
subject
was
people
can
not
always
talk
about
tulips
they
therefore
began
to
chat
also
about
other
things
and
the
found
out
to
his
great
astonishment
what
a
vast
range
of
subjects
a
conversation
may
comprise
only
rosa
had
made
it
a
habit
to
keep
her
pretty
face
invariably
six
inches
distant
from
the
grating
having
perhaps
become
distrustful
of
herself
there
was
one
thing
especially
which
gave
cornelius
almost
as
much
anxiety
as
his
bulbs
a
subject
to
which
he
always
returned
the
dependence
of
rosa
on
her
father
indeed
van
baerle
s
happiness
depended
on
the
whim
of
this
man
he
might
one
day
find
loewestein
dull
or
the
air
of
the
place
unhealthy
or
the
gin
bad
and
leave
the
fortress
and
take
his
daughter
with
him
when
cornelius
and
rosa
would
again
be
separated
of
what
use
would
the
carrier
pigeons
then
be
said
cornelius
to
rosa
as
you
my
dear
girl
would
not
be
able
to
read
what
i
should
write
to
you
nor
to
write
to
me
your
thoughts
in
well
answered
rosa
who
in
her
heart
was
as
much
afraid
of
a
separation
as
cornelius
himself
we
have
one
hour
every
evening
let
us
make
good
use
of
i
don
t
think
we
make
such
a
bad
use
of
it
as
it
let
us
employ
it
even
better
said
rosa
smiling
teach
me
to
read
and
write
i
shall
make
the
best
of
your
lessons
believe
me
and
in
this
way
we
shall
never
be
separated
any
more
except
by
our
own
oh
then
we
have
an
eternity
before
us
said
cornelius
rosa
smiled
and
quietly
shrugged
her
shoulders
will
you
remain
for
ever
in
prison
she
said
and
after
having
granted
you
your
life
will
not
his
highness
also
grant
you
your
liberty
and
will
you
not
then
recover
your
fortune
and
be
a
rich
man
and
then
when
you
are
driving
in
your
own
coach
riding
your
own
horse
will
you
still
look
at
poor
rosa
the
daughter
of
a
jailer
scarcely
better
than
a
hangman
cornelius
tried
to
contradict
her
and
certainly
he
would
have
done
so
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
the
sincerity
of
a
soul
full
of
love
she
however
smilingly
interrupted
him
saying
how
is
your
tulip
going
on
to
speak
to
cornelius
of
his
tulip
was
an
expedient
resorted
to
by
her
to
make
him
forget
everything
even
rosa
herself
very
well
indeed
he
said
the
coat
is
growing
black
the
sprouting
has
commenced
the
veins
of
the
bulb
are
swelling
in
eight
days
hence
and
perhaps
sooner
we
may
distinguish
the
first
buds
of
the
leaves
protruding
and
yours
rosa
oh
i
have
done
things
on
a
large
scale
and
according
to
your
now
let
me
hear
rosa
what
you
have
done
said
cornelius
with
as
tender
an
anxiety
as
he
had
lately
shown
to
herself
well
she
said
smiling
for
in
her
own
heart
she
could
not
help
studying
this
double
love
of
the
prisoner
for
herself
and
for
the
black
tulip
i
have
done
things
on
a
large
scale
i
have
prepared
a
bed
as
you
described
it
to
me
on
a
clear
spot
far
from
trees
and
walls
in
a
soil
slightly
mixed
with
sand
rather
moist
than
dry
without
a
fragment
of
stone
or
well
done
rosa
well
i
am
now
only
waiting
for
your
further
orders
to
put
in
the
bulb
you
know
that
i
must
be
behindhand
with
you
as
i
have
in
my
favour
all
the
chances
of
good
air
of
the
sun
and
abundance
of
all
true
all
true
exclaimed
cornelius
clapping
his
hands
with
joy
you
are
a
good
pupil
rosa
and
you
are
sure
to
gain
your
hundred
thousand
don
t
forget
said
rosa
smiling
that
your
pupil
as
you
call
me
has
still
other
things
to
learn
besides
the
cultivation
of
yes
yes
and
i
am
as
anxious
as
you
are
rosa
that
you
should
learn
to
when
shall
we
begin
at
no
why
because
our
hour
is
expired
and
i
must
leave
already
but
what
shall
we
read
oh
said
rosa
i
have
a
book
a
book
which
i
hope
will
bring
us
yes
on
the
following
evening
rosa
returned
with
the
bible
of
cornelius
de
witt
chapter
the
first
bulb
on
the
following
evening
as
we
have
said
rosa
returned
with
the
bible
of
cornelius
de
witt
then
began
between
the
master
and
the
pupil
one
of
those
charming
scenes
which
are
the
delight
of
the
novelist
who
has
to
describe
them
the
grated
window
the
only
opening
through
which
the
two
lovers
were
able
to
communicate
was
too
high
for
conveniently
reading
a
book
although
it
had
been
quite
convenient
for
them
to
read
each
other
s
faces
rosa
therefore
had
to
press
the
open
book
against
the
grating
edgewise
holding
above
it
in
her
right
hand
the
lamp
but
cornelius
hit
upon
the
lucky
idea
of
fixing
it
to
the
bars
so
as
to
afford
her
a
little
rest
rosa
was
then
enabled
to
follow
with
her
finger
the
letters
and
syllables
which
she
was
to
spell
for
cornelius
who
with
a
straw
pointed
out
the
letters
to
his
attentive
pupil
through
the
holes
of
the
grating
the
light
of
the
lamp
illuminated
the
rich
complexion
of
rosa
her
blue
liquid
eyes
and
her
golden
hair
under
her
of
gold
brocade
with
her
fingers
held
up
and
showing
in
the
blood
as
it
flowed
downwards
in
the
veins
that
pale
pink
hue
which
shines
before
the
light
owing
to
the
living
transparency
of
the
flesh
tint
rosa
s
intellect
rapidly
developed
itself
under
the
animating
influence
of
cornelius
and
when
the
difficulties
seemed
too
arduous
the
sympathy
of
two
loving
hearts
seemed
to
smooth
them
away
and
rosa
after
having
returned
to
her
room
repeated
in
her
solitude
the
reading
lessons
and
at
the
same
time
recalled
all
the
delight
which
she
had
felt
whilst
receiving
them
one
evening
she
came
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
this
was
too
extraordinary
an
instance
not
to
call
forth
at
once
cornelius
s
inquiries
after
its
cause
oh
do
not
be
angry
with
me
she
said
it
is
not
my
fault
my
father
has
renewed
an
acquaintance
with
an
old
crony
who
used
to
visit
him
at
the
hague
and
to
ask
him
to
let
him
see
the
prison
he
is
a
good
sort
of
fellow
fond
of
his
bottle
tells
funny
stories
and
moreover
is
very
free
with
his
money
so
as
always
to
be
ready
to
stand
a
you
don
t
know
anything
further
of
him
asked
cornelius
surprised
no
she
answered
it
s
only
for
about
a
fortnight
that
my
father
has
taken
such
a
fancy
to
this
friend
who
is
so
assiduous
in
visiting
ah
so
said
cornelius
shaking
his
head
uneasily
as
every
new
incident
seemed
to
him
to
forebode
some
catastrophe
very
likely
some
spy
one
of
those
who
are
sent
into
jails
to
watch
both
prisoners
and
their
i
don
t
believe
that
said
rosa
smiling
if
that
worthy
person
is
spying
after
any
one
it
is
certainly
not
after
my
after
whom
then
me
for
you
why
not
said
rosa
smiling
ah
that
s
true
cornelius
observed
with
a
sigh
you
will
not
always
have
suitors
in
vain
this
man
may
become
your
i
don
t
say
anything
to
the
what
cause
have
you
to
entertain
such
a
happy
prospect
rather
say
this
fear
mynheer
thank
you
rosa
you
are
right
well
i
will
say
then
this
fear
i
have
only
this
reason
tell
me
i
am
anxious
to
this
man
came
several
times
before
to
the
buytenhof
at
the
hague
i
remember
now
it
was
just
about
the
time
when
you
were
confined
there
when
i
left
he
left
too
when
i
came
here
he
came
after
me
at
the
hague
his
pretext
was
that
he
wanted
to
see
see
me
yes
it
must
have
undoubtedly
been
only
a
pretext
for
now
when
he
could
plead
the
same
reason
as
you
are
my
father
s
prisoner
again
he
does
not
care
any
longer
for
you
quite
the
contrary
i
heard
him
say
to
my
father
only
yesterday
that
he
did
not
know
go
on
rosa
pray
do
that
i
may
guess
who
that
man
is
and
what
he
are
you
quite
sure
mynheer
cornelius
that
none
of
your
friends
can
interest
himself
for
you
i
have
no
friends
rosa
i
have
only
my
old
nurse
whom
you
know
and
who
knows
you
alas
poor
sue
she
would
come
herself
and
use
no
roundabout
ways
she
would
at
once
say
to
your
father
or
to
you
my
good
sir
or
my
good
miss
my
child
is
here
see
how
grieved
i
am
let
me
see
him
only
for
one
hour
and
i
ll
pray
for
you
as
long
as
i
no
no
continued
cornelius
with
the
exception
of
my
poor
old
sue
i
have
no
friends
in
this
then
i
come
back
to
what
i
thought
before
and
the
more
so
as
last
evening
at
sunset
whilst
i
was
arranging
the
border
where
i
am
to
plant
your
bulb
i
saw
a
shadow
gliding
between
the
alder
trees
and
the
aspens
i
did
not
appear
to
see
him
but
it
was
this
man
he
concealed
himself
and
saw
me
digging
the
ground
and
certainly
it
was
me
whom
he
followed
and
me
whom
he
was
spying
after
i
could
not
move
my
rake
or
touch
one
atom
of
soil
without
his
noticing
oh
yes
yes
he
is
in
love
with
you
said
cornelius
is
he
young
is
he
handsome
saying
this
he
looked
anxiously
at
rosa
eagerly
waiting
for
her
answer
young
handsome
cried
rosa
bursting
into
a
laugh
he
is
hideous
to
look
at
crooked
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
and
never
dares
to
look
me
in
the
face
or
to
speak
except
in
an
and
his
name
jacob
i
don
t
know
then
you
see
that
at
all
events
he
does
not
come
after
at
any
rate
if
he
loves
you
rosa
which
is
very
likely
as
to
see
you
is
to
love
you
at
least
you
don
t
love
to
be
sure
i
don
then
you
wish
me
to
keep
my
mind
easy
i
should
certainly
ask
you
to
do
well
then
now
as
you
begin
to
know
how
to
read
you
will
read
all
that
i
write
to
you
of
the
pangs
of
jealousy
and
of
absence
won
t
you
rosa
i
shall
read
it
if
you
write
with
good
big
then
as
the
turn
which
the
conversation
took
began
to
make
rosa
uneasy
she
asked
by
the
bye
how
is
your
tulip
going
on
oh
rosa
only
imagine
my
joy
this
morning
i
looked
at
it
in
the
sun
and
after
having
moved
the
soil
aside
which
covers
the
bulb
i
saw
the
first
sprouting
of
the
leaves
this
small
germ
has
caused
me
a
much
greater
emotion
than
the
order
of
his
highness
which
turned
aside
the
sword
already
raised
at
the
you
hope
then
said
rosa
smiling
yes
yes
i
and
i
in
my
turn
when
shall
i
plant
my
bulb
oh
the
first
favourable
day
i
will
tell
you
but
whatever
you
do
let
nobody
help
you
and
don
t
confide
your
secret
to
any
one
in
the
world
do
you
see
a
connoisseur
by
merely
looking
at
the
bulb
would
be
able
to
distinguish
its
value
and
so
my
dearest
rosa
be
careful
in
locking
up
the
third
sucker
which
remains
to
it
is
still
wrapped
up
in
the
same
paper
in
which
you
put
it
and
just
as
you
gave
it
me
i
have
laid
it
at
the
bottom
of
my
chest
under
my
point
lace
which
keeps
it
dry
without
pressing
upon
it
but
good
night
my
poor
captive
how
already
it
must
be
it
must
coming
so
late
and
going
so
my
father
might
grow
impatient
not
seeing
me
return
and
that
precious
lover
might
suspect
a
here
she
listened
uneasily
what
is
it
asked
van
baerle
i
thought
i
heard
what
then
something
like
a
step
creaking
on
the
surely
said
the
prisoner
that
can
not
be
master
gryphus
he
is
always
heard
at
a
no
it
is
not
my
father
i
am
quite
sure
but
but
but
it
might
be
mynheer
rosa
rushed
toward
the
staircase
and
a
door
was
really
heard
rapidly
to
close
before
the
young
damsel
had
got
down
the
first
ten
steps
cornelius
was
very
uneasy
about
it
but
it
was
after
all
only
a
prelude
to
greater
anxieties
the
flowing
day
passed
without
any
remarkable
incident
gryphus
made
his
three
visits
and
discovered
nothing
he
never
came
at
the
same
hours
as
he
hoped
thus
to
discover
the
secrets
of
the
prisoner
van
baerle
therefore
had
devised
a
contrivance
a
sort
of
pulley
by
means
of
which
he
was
able
to
lower
or
to
raise
his
jug
below
the
ledge
of
tiles
and
stone
before
his
window
the
strings
by
which
this
was
effected
he
had
found
means
to
cover
with
that
moss
which
generally
grows
on
tiles
or
in
the
crannies
of
the
walls
gryphus
suspected
nothing
and
the
device
succeeded
for
eight
days
one
morning
however
when
cornelius
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
his
bulb
from
which
a
germ
of
vegetation
was
already
peeping
forth
had
not
heard
old
gryphus
coming
upstairs
as
a
gale
of
wind
was
blowing
which
shook
the
whole
tower
the
door
suddenly
opened
gryphus
perceiving
an
unknown
and
consequently
a
forbidden
object
in
the
hands
of
his
prisoner
pounced
upon
it
with
the
same
rapidity
as
the
hawk
on
its
prey
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
his
coarse
hard
hand
the
same
which
he
had
broken
and
which
cornelius
van
baerle
had
set
so
well
grasped
at
once
in
the
midst
of
the
jug
on
the
spot
where
the
bulb
was
lying
in
the
soil
what
have
you
got
here
he
roared
ah
have
i
caught
you
and
with
this
he
grabbed
in
the
soil
i
nothing
nothing
cried
cornelius
trembling
ah
have
i
caught
you
a
jug
and
earth
in
it
there
is
some
criminal
secret
at
the
bottom
of
all
oh
my
good
master
gryphus
said
van
baerle
imploringly
and
anxious
as
the
partridge
robbed
of
her
young
by
the
reaper
in
fact
gryphus
was
beginning
to
dig
the
soil
with
his
crooked
fingers
take
care
sir
take
care
said
cornelius
growing
quite
pale
care
of
what
zounds
of
what
roared
the
jailer
take
care
i
say
you
will
crush
it
master
and
with
a
rapid
and
almost
frantic
movement
he
snatched
the
jug
from
the
hands
of
gryphus
and
hid
it
like
a
treasure
under
his
arms
but
gryphus
obstinate
like
an
old
man
and
more
and
more
convinced
that
he
was
discovering
here
a
conspiracy
against
the
prince
of
orange
rushed
up
to
his
prisoner
raising
his
stick
seeing
however
the
impassible
resolution
of
the
captive
to
protect
his
he
was
convinced
that
cornelius
trembled
much
less
for
his
head
than
for
his
jug
he
therefore
tried
to
wrest
it
from
him
by
force
halloa
said
the
jailer
furious
here
you
see
you
are
leave
me
my
tulip
cried
van
baerle
ah
yes
tulip
replied
the
old
man
we
know
well
the
shifts
of
but
i
vow
to
you
let
go
repeated
gryphus
stamping
his
foot
let
go
or
i
shall
call
the
call
whoever
you
like
but
you
shall
not
have
this
flower
except
with
my
gryphus
exasperated
plunged
his
finger
a
second
time
into
the
soil
and
now
he
drew
out
the
bulb
which
certainly
looked
quite
black
and
whilst
van
baerle
quite
happy
to
have
saved
the
vessel
did
not
suspect
that
the
adversary
had
possessed
himself
of
its
precious
contents
gryphus
hurled
the
softened
bulb
with
all
his
force
on
the
flags
where
almost
immediately
after
it
was
crushed
to
atoms
under
his
heavy
shoe
van
baerle
saw
the
work
of
destruction
got
a
glimpse
of
the
juicy
remains
of
his
darling
bulb
and
guessing
the
cause
of
the
ferocious
joy
of
gryphus
uttered
a
cry
of
agony
which
would
have
melted
the
heart
even
of
that
ruthless
jailer
who
some
years
before
killed
pelisson
s
spider
the
idea
of
striking
down
this
spiteful
bully
passed
like
lightning
through
the
brain
of
the
the
blood
rushed
to
his
brow
and
seemed
like
fire
in
his
eyes
which
blinded
him
and
he
raised
in
his
two
hands
the
heavy
jug
with
all
the
now
useless
earth
which
remained
in
it
one
instant
more
and
he
would
have
flung
it
on
the
bald
head
of
old
gryphus
but
a
cry
stopped
him
a
cry
of
agony
uttered
by
poor
rosa
who
trembling
and
pale
with
her
arms
raised
to
heaven
made
her
appearance
behind
the
grated
window
and
thus
interposed
between
her
father
and
her
friend
gryphus
then
understood
the
danger
with
which
he
had
been
threatened
and
he
broke
out
in
a
volley
of
the
most
terrible
abuse
indeed
said
cornelius
to
him
you
must
be
a
very
mean
and
spiteful
fellow
to
rob
a
poor
prisoner
of
his
only
consolation
a
tulip
for
shame
my
father
rosa
chimed
in
it
is
indeed
a
crime
you
have
committed
ah
is
that
you
my
little
the
old
man
cried
boiling
with
rage
and
turning
towards
her
don
t
you
meddle
with
what
don
t
concern
you
but
go
down
as
quickly
as
unfortunate
me
continued
cornelius
overwhelmed
with
grief
after
all
it
is
but
a
tulip
gryphus
resumed
as
he
began
to
be
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
you
may
have
as
many
tulips
as
you
like
i
have
three
hundred
of
them
in
my
to
the
devil
with
your
tulips
cried
cornelius
you
are
worthy
of
each
other
had
i
a
hundred
thousand
millions
of
them
i
would
gladly
give
them
for
the
one
which
you
have
just
oh
so
gryphus
said
in
a
tone
of
triumph
now
there
we
have
it
it
was
not
your
tulip
you
cared
for
there
was
in
that
false
bulb
some
witchcraft
perhaps
some
means
of
correspondence
with
conspirators
against
his
highness
who
has
granted
you
your
life
i
always
said
they
were
wrong
in
not
cutting
your
head
father
father
cried
rosa
yes
yes
it
is
better
as
it
is
now
repeated
gryphus
growing
warm
i
have
destroyed
it
and
i
ll
do
the
same
again
as
often
as
you
repeat
the
trick
didn
t
i
tell
you
my
fine
fellow
that
i
would
make
your
life
a
hard
one
a
curse
on
you
cornelius
exclaimed
quite
beyond
himself
with
despair
as
he
gathered
with
his
trembling
fingers
the
remnants
of
that
bulb
on
which
he
had
rested
so
many
joys
and
so
many
hopes
we
shall
plant
the
other
my
dear
mynheer
cornelius
said
rosa
in
a
low
voice
who
understood
the
intense
grief
of
the
unfortunate
and
who
with
the
pure
sacred
love
of
her
innocent
heart
poured
these
kind
words
like
a
drop
of
balm
on
the
bleeding
wounds
of
cornelius
chapter
rosa
s
lover
rosa
had
scarcely
pronounced
these
consolatory
words
when
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
staircase
asking
gryphus
how
matters
were
going
on
do
you
hear
father
said
rosa
what
master
jacob
calls
you
he
is
there
was
such
a
noise
said
gryphus
wouldn
t
you
have
thought
he
would
murder
me
this
doctor
they
are
always
very
troublesome
fellows
these
then
pointing
with
his
finger
towards
the
staircase
he
said
to
rosa
just
lead
the
way
after
this
he
locked
the
door
and
called
out
i
shall
be
with
you
directly
friend
poor
cornelius
thus
left
alone
with
his
bitter
grief
muttered
to
himself
ah
you
old
hangman
it
is
me
you
have
trodden
under
foot
you
have
murdered
me
i
shall
not
survive
and
certainly
the
unfortunate
prisoner
would
have
fallen
ill
but
for
the
counterpoise
which
providence
had
granted
to
his
grief
and
which
was
called
rosa
in
the
evening
she
came
back
her
first
words
announced
to
cornelius
that
henceforth
her
father
would
make
no
objection
to
his
cultivating
flowers
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
prisoner
asked
with
a
doleful
look
i
know
it
because
he
has
said
to
deceive
me
no
he
ah
yes
but
too
this
repentance
is
not
of
and
who
put
it
into
him
if
you
only
knew
how
his
friend
scolded
him
ah
master
jacob
he
does
not
leave
you
then
that
master
jacob
at
any
rate
he
leaves
us
as
little
as
he
can
saying
this
she
smiled
in
such
a
way
that
the
little
cloud
of
jealousy
which
had
darkened
the
brow
of
cornelius
speedily
vanished
how
was
it
asked
the
prisoner
well
being
asked
by
his
friend
my
father
told
at
supper
the
whole
story
of
the
tulip
or
rather
of
the
bulb
and
of
his
own
fine
exploit
of
crushing
cornelius
heaved
a
sigh
which
might
have
been
called
a
groan
had
you
only
seen
master
jacob
at
that
moment
continued
rosa
i
really
thought
he
would
set
fire
to
the
castle
his
eyes
were
like
two
flaming
torches
his
hair
stood
on
end
and
he
clinched
his
fist
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
would
have
strangled
my
you
have
done
that
he
cried
you
have
crushed
the
bulb
indeed
i
it
is
infamous
said
master
jacob
it
is
odious
you
have
committed
a
great
crime
my
father
was
quite
dumbfounded
are
you
mad
too
he
asked
his
oh
what
a
worthy
man
is
this
master
jacob
muttered
cornelius
an
honest
soul
an
excellent
heart
that
he
the
truth
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
treat
a
man
more
rudely
than
he
did
my
father
he
was
really
quite
in
despair
repeating
over
and
over
again
crushed
crushed
the
bulb
my
god
my
god
crushed
then
turning
toward
me
he
asked
but
it
was
not
the
only
one
that
he
had
did
he
ask
that
inquired
cornelius
with
some
anxiety
you
think
it
was
not
the
only
one
said
my
father
very
well
we
shall
search
for
the
you
will
search
for
the
others
cried
jacob
taking
my
father
by
the
collar
but
he
immediately
loosed
him
then
turning
towards
me
he
continued
asking
and
what
did
that
poor
young
man
say
i
did
not
know
what
to
answer
as
you
had
so
strictly
enjoined
me
never
to
allow
any
one
to
guess
the
interest
which
you
are
taking
in
the
bulb
fortunately
my
father
saved
me
from
the
difficulty
by
chiming
in
what
did
he
say
didn
t
he
fume
and
fret
i
interrupted
him
saying
was
it
not
natural
that
he
should
be
furious
you
were
so
unjust
and
brutal
father
well
now
are
you
mad
cried
my
father
what
immense
misfortune
is
it
to
crush
a
tulip
bulb
you
may
buy
a
hundred
of
them
in
the
market
of
perhaps
some
less
precious
one
than
that
was
i
quite
incautiously
and
what
did
jacob
say
or
do
at
these
words
asked
cornelius
at
these
words
if
i
must
say
it
his
eyes
seemed
to
flash
like
but
said
cornelius
that
was
not
all
i
am
sure
he
said
something
in
his
so
then
my
pretty
rosa
he
said
with
a
voice
as
sweet
a
honey
so
you
think
that
bulb
to
have
been
a
precious
one
i
saw
that
i
had
made
a
blunder
what
do
i
know
i
said
negligently
do
i
understand
anything
of
tulips
i
only
know
as
unfortunately
it
is
our
lot
to
live
with
prisoners
that
for
them
any
pastime
is
of
value
this
poor
mynheer
van
baerle
amused
himself
with
this
bulb
well
i
think
it
very
cruel
to
take
from
him
the
only
thing
that
he
could
have
amused
himself
but
first
of
all
said
my
father
we
ought
to
know
how
he
has
contrived
to
procure
this
i
turned
my
eyes
away
to
avoid
my
father
s
look
but
i
met
those
of
jacob
it
was
as
if
he
had
tried
to
read
my
thoughts
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
some
little
show
of
anger
sometimes
saves
an
answer
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
turned
my
back
and
advanced
towards
the
door
but
i
was
kept
by
something
which
i
heard
although
it
was
uttered
in
a
very
low
voice
only
jacob
said
to
my
father
it
would
not
be
so
difficult
to
ascertain
how
so
you
need
only
search
his
person
and
if
he
has
the
other
bulbs
we
shall
find
them
as
there
usually
are
three
suckers
three
suckers
cried
cornelius
did
you
say
that
i
have
three
the
word
certainly
struck
me
just
as
much
as
it
does
you
i
turned
round
they
were
both
of
them
so
deeply
engaged
in
their
conversation
that
they
did
not
observe
my
movement
but
said
my
father
perhaps
he
has
not
got
his
bulbs
about
him
then
take
him
down
under
some
pretext
or
other
and
i
will
search
his
cell
in
the
halloa
halloa
said
cornelius
but
this
jacob
of
yours
is
a
villain
it
i
am
afraid
he
tell
me
rosa
continued
cornelius
with
a
pensive
air
what
did
you
not
tell
me
that
on
the
day
when
you
prepared
your
borders
this
man
followed
you
so
he
that
he
glided
like
a
shadow
behind
the
elder
trees
that
not
one
of
your
movements
escaped
him
not
one
rosa
said
cornelius
growing
quite
pale
well
it
was
not
you
he
was
who
else
then
it
is
not
you
that
he
was
in
love
with
but
with
whom
else
he
was
after
my
bulb
and
is
in
love
with
my
tulip
you
don
t
say
so
and
yet
it
is
very
possible
said
rosa
will
you
make
sure
of
it
in
what
manner
oh
it
would
be
very
easy
tell
go
into
the
garden
manage
matters
so
that
jacob
may
know
as
he
did
the
first
time
that
you
are
going
there
and
that
he
may
follow
you
feign
to
put
the
bulb
into
the
ground
leave
the
garden
but
look
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
and
watch
well
and
what
then
what
then
we
shall
do
as
he
oh
said
rosa
with
a
sigh
you
are
very
fond
of
your
to
tell
the
truth
said
the
prisoner
sighing
likewise
since
your
father
crushed
that
unfortunate
bulb
i
feel
as
if
part
of
my
own
self
had
been
now
just
hear
me
said
rosa
will
you
try
something
else
what
will
you
accept
the
proposition
of
my
father
which
proposition
did
not
he
offer
to
you
tulip
bulbs
by
hundreds
indeed
he
accept
two
or
three
and
along
with
them
you
may
grow
the
third
yes
that
would
do
very
well
said
cornelius
knitting
his
brow
if
your
father
were
alone
but
there
is
that
master
jacob
who
watches
all
our
well
that
is
true
but
only
think
you
are
depriving
yourself
as
i
can
easily
see
of
a
very
great
she
pronounced
these
words
with
a
smile
which
was
not
altogether
without
a
tinge
of
irony
cornelius
reflected
for
a
moment
he
evidently
was
struggling
against
some
vehement
desire
no
he
cried
at
last
with
the
stoicism
of
a
roman
of
old
it
would
be
a
weakness
it
would
be
a
folly
it
would
be
a
meanness
if
i
thus
give
up
the
only
and
last
resource
which
we
possess
to
the
uncertain
chances
of
the
bad
passions
of
anger
and
envy
i
should
never
deserve
to
be
forgiven
no
rosa
no
we
shall
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
the
spot
to
be
chosen
for
your
tulip
you
will
plant
it
according
to
my
instructions
and
as
to
the
third
sucker
cornelius
here
heaved
a
deep
sigh
watch
over
it
as
a
miser
over
his
first
or
last
piece
of
gold
as
the
mother
over
her
child
as
the
wounded
over
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
watch
over
it
rosa
some
voice
within
me
tells
me
that
it
will
be
our
saving
that
it
will
be
a
source
of
good
to
be
easy
mynheer
cornelius
said
rosa
with
a
sweet
mixture
of
melancholy
and
gravity
be
easy
your
wishes
are
commands
to
and
even
continued
van
baerle
warming
more
and
more
with
his
subject
if
you
should
perceive
that
your
steps
are
watched
and
that
your
speech
has
excited
the
suspicion
of
your
father
and
of
that
detestable
master
jacob
well
rosa
don
t
hesitate
for
one
moment
to
sacrifice
me
who
am
only
still
living
through
you
me
who
have
no
one
in
the
world
but
you
sacrifice
me
don
t
come
to
see
me
any
rosa
felt
her
heart
sink
within
her
and
her
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
alas
she
said
what
is
it
asked
cornelius
i
see
one
what
do
you
see
i
see
said
she
bursting
out
in
sobs
i
see
that
you
love
your
tulips
with
such
love
as
to
have
no
more
room
in
your
heart
left
for
other
saying
this
she
fled
cornelius
after
this
passed
one
of
the
worst
nights
he
ever
had
in
his
life
rosa
was
vexed
with
him
and
with
good
reason
perhaps
she
would
never
return
to
see
the
prisoner
and
then
he
would
have
no
more
news
either
of
rosa
or
of
his
tulips
we
have
to
confess
to
the
disgrace
of
our
hero
and
of
floriculture
that
of
his
two
affections
he
felt
most
strongly
inclined
to
regret
the
loss
of
rosa
and
when
at
about
three
in
the
morning
he
fell
asleep
overcome
with
fatigue
and
harassed
with
remorse
the
grand
black
tulip
yielded
precedence
in
his
dreams
to
the
sweet
blue
eyes
of
the
fair
maid
of
friesland
chapter
the
maid
and
the
flower
but
poor
rosa
in
her
secluded
chamber
could
not
have
known
of
whom
or
of
what
cornelius
was
dreaming
from
what
he
had
said
she
was
more
ready
to
believe
that
he
dreamed
of
the
black
tulip
than
of
her
and
yet
rosa
was
mistaken
but
as
there
was
no
one
to
tell
her
so
and
as
the
words
of
cornelius
s
thoughtless
speech
had
fallen
upon
her
heart
like
drops
of
poison
she
did
not
dream
but
she
wept
the
fact
was
that
as
rosa
was
a
creature
of
no
mean
perception
and
a
noble
heart
she
took
a
very
clear
and
judicious
view
of
her
own
social
position
if
not
of
her
moral
and
physical
qualities
cornelius
was
a
scholar
and
was
wealthy
at
least
he
had
been
before
the
confiscation
of
his
property
cornelius
belonged
to
the
who
were
prouder
of
their
richly
emblazoned
shop
signs
than
the
hereditary
nobility
of
their
heraldic
bearings
therefore
although
he
might
find
rosa
a
pleasant
companion
for
the
dreary
hours
of
his
captivity
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
bestowing
his
heart
it
was
almost
certain
that
he
would
bestow
it
upon
a
tulip
that
is
to
say
upon
the
proudest
and
noblest
of
flowers
rather
than
upon
poor
rosa
the
jailer
s
lowly
child
thus
rosa
understood
cornelius
s
preference
of
the
tulip
to
herself
but
was
only
so
much
the
more
unhappy
therefor
during
the
whole
of
this
terrible
night
the
poor
girl
did
not
close
an
eye
and
before
she
rose
in
the
morning
she
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
making
her
appearance
at
the
grated
window
no
more
but
as
she
knew
with
what
ardent
desire
cornelius
looked
forward
to
the
news
about
his
tulip
and
as
notwithstanding
her
determination
not
to
see
any
more
a
man
her
pity
for
whose
fate
was
fast
growing
into
love
she
did
not
on
the
other
hand
wish
to
drive
him
to
despair
she
resolved
to
continue
by
herself
the
reading
and
writing
lessons
and
fortunately
she
had
made
sufficient
progress
to
dispense
with
the
help
of
a
master
when
the
master
was
not
to
be
cornelius
rosa
therefore
applied
herself
most
diligently
to
reading
poor
cornelius
de
witt
s
bible
on
the
second
fly
leaf
of
which
the
last
will
of
cornelius
van
baerle
was
written
alas
she
muttered
when
perusing
again
this
document
which
she
never
finished
without
a
tear
the
pearl
of
love
rolling
from
her
limpid
eyes
on
her
pale
cheeks
alas
at
that
time
i
thought
for
one
moment
he
loved
poor
rosa
she
was
mistaken
never
had
the
love
of
the
prisoner
been
more
sincere
than
at
the
time
at
which
we
are
now
arrived
when
in
the
contest
between
the
black
tulip
and
rosa
the
tulip
had
had
to
yield
to
her
the
first
and
foremost
place
in
cornelius
s
heart
but
rosa
was
not
aware
of
it
having
finished
reading
she
took
her
pen
and
began
with
as
laudable
diligence
the
by
far
more
difficult
task
of
writing
as
however
rosa
was
already
able
to
write
a
legible
hand
when
cornelius
so
uncautiously
opened
his
heart
she
did
not
despair
of
progressing
quickly
enough
to
write
after
eight
days
at
the
latest
to
the
prisoner
an
account
of
his
tulip
she
had
not
forgotten
one
word
of
the
directions
given
to
her
by
cornelius
whose
speeches
she
treasured
in
her
heart
even
when
they
did
not
take
the
shape
of
directions
he
on
his
part
awoke
deeper
in
love
than
ever
the
tulip
indeed
was
still
a
luminous
and
prominent
object
in
his
mind
but
he
no
longer
looked
upon
it
as
a
treasure
to
which
he
ought
to
sacrifice
everything
and
even
rosa
but
as
a
marvellous
combination
of
nature
and
art
with
which
he
would
have
been
happy
to
adorn
the
bosom
of
his
beloved
one
yet
during
the
whole
of
that
day
he
was
haunted
with
a
vague
uneasiness
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
the
fear
lest
rosa
should
not
come
in
the
evening
to
pay
him
her
usual
visit
this
thought
took
more
and
more
hold
of
him
until
at
the
approach
of
evening
his
whole
mind
was
absorbed
in
it
how
his
heart
beat
when
darkness
closed
in
the
words
which
he
had
said
to
rosa
on
the
evening
before
and
which
had
so
deeply
afflicted
her
now
came
back
to
his
mind
more
vividly
than
ever
and
he
asked
himself
how
he
could
have
told
his
gentle
comforter
to
sacrifice
him
to
his
tulip
that
is
to
say
to
give
up
seeing
him
if
need
be
whereas
to
him
the
sight
of
rosa
had
become
a
condition
of
life
in
cornelius
s
cell
one
heard
the
chimes
of
the
clock
of
the
fortress
it
struck
seven
it
struck
eight
it
struck
nine
never
did
the
metal
voice
vibrate
more
forcibly
through
the
heart
of
any
man
than
did
the
last
stroke
marking
the
ninth
hour
through
the
heart
of
cornelius
all
was
then
silent
again
cornelius
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
to
repress
as
it
were
its
violent
palpitation
and
listened
the
noise
of
her
footstep
the
rustling
of
her
gown
on
the
staircase
were
so
familiar
to
his
ear
that
she
had
no
sooner
mounted
one
step
than
he
used
to
say
to
himself
here
comes
this
evening
none
of
those
little
noises
broke
the
silence
of
the
lobby
the
clock
struck
nine
and
a
quarter
the
then
a
quarter
to
ten
and
at
last
its
deep
tone
announced
not
only
to
the
inmates
of
the
fortress
but
also
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
loewestein
that
it
was
ten
this
was
the
hour
at
which
rosa
generally
used
to
leave
cornelius
the
hour
had
struck
but
rosa
had
not
come
thus
then
his
foreboding
had
not
deceived
him
rosa
being
vexed
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
left
him
to
himself
alas
he
thought
i
have
deserved
all
this
she
will
come
no
more
and
she
is
right
in
staying
away
in
her
place
i
should
do
just
the
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
cornelius
listened
waited
and
hoped
until
midnight
then
he
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
with
his
clothes
on
it
was
a
long
and
sad
night
for
him
and
the
day
brought
no
hope
to
the
prisoner
at
eight
in
the
morning
the
door
of
his
cell
opened
but
cornelius
did
not
even
turn
his
head
he
had
heard
the
heavy
step
of
gryphus
in
the
lobby
but
this
step
had
perfectly
satisfied
the
prisoner
that
his
jailer
was
coming
alone
thus
cornelius
did
not
even
look
at
gryphus
and
yet
he
would
have
been
so
glad
to
draw
him
out
and
to
inquire
about
rosa
he
even
very
nearly
made
this
inquiry
strange
as
it
would
needs
have
appeared
to
her
father
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
in
all
this
some
selfish
hope
to
hear
from
gryphus
that
his
daughter
was
ill
except
on
extraordinary
occasions
rosa
never
came
during
the
day
cornelius
therefore
did
not
really
expect
her
as
long
as
the
day
lasted
yet
his
sudden
starts
his
listening
at
the
door
his
rapid
glances
at
every
little
noise
towards
the
grated
window
showed
clearly
that
the
prisoner
entertained
some
latent
hope
that
rosa
would
somehow
or
other
break
her
rule
at
the
second
visit
of
gryphus
cornelius
contrary
to
all
his
former
habits
asked
the
old
jailer
with
the
most
winning
voice
about
her
health
but
gryphus
contented
himself
with
giving
the
laconical
answer
all
s
at
the
third
visit
of
the
day
cornelius
changed
his
former
inquiry
i
hope
nobody
is
ill
at
loewestein
nobody
replied
even
more
laconically
the
jailer
shutting
the
door
before
the
nose
of
the
prisoner
gryphus
being
little
used
to
this
sort
of
civility
on
the
part
of
cornelius
began
to
suspect
that
his
prisoner
was
about
to
try
and
bribe
him
cornelius
was
now
alone
once
more
it
was
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
the
anxiety
of
yesterday
returned
with
increased
intensity
but
another
time
the
hours
passed
away
without
bringing
the
sweet
vision
which
lighted
up
through
the
grated
window
the
cell
of
poor
cornelius
and
which
in
retiring
left
light
enough
in
his
heart
to
last
until
it
came
back
again
van
baerle
passed
the
night
in
an
agony
of
despair
on
the
following
day
gryphus
appeared
to
him
even
more
hideous
brutal
and
hateful
than
usual
in
his
mind
or
rather
in
his
heart
there
had
been
some
hope
that
it
was
the
old
man
who
prevented
his
daughter
from
coming
in
his
wrath
he
would
have
strangled
gryphus
but
would
not
this
have
separated
him
for
ever
from
rosa
the
evening
closing
in
his
despair
changed
into
melancholy
which
was
the
more
gloomy
as
involuntarily
van
baerle
mixed
up
with
it
the
thought
of
his
poor
tulip
it
was
now
just
that
week
in
april
which
the
most
experienced
gardeners
point
out
as
the
precise
time
when
tulips
ought
to
be
planted
he
had
said
to
rosa
i
shall
tell
you
the
day
when
you
are
to
put
the
bulb
in
the
he
had
intended
to
fix
at
the
vainly
hoped
for
interview
the
following
day
as
the
time
for
that
momentous
operation
the
weather
was
propitious
the
air
though
still
damp
began
to
be
tempered
by
those
pale
rays
of
the
april
sun
which
being
the
first
appear
so
congenial
although
so
pale
how
if
rosa
allowed
the
right
moment
for
planting
the
bulb
to
pass
by
if
in
addition
to
the
grief
of
seeing
her
no
more
he
should
have
to
deplore
the
misfortune
of
seeing
his
tulip
fail
on
account
of
its
having
been
planted
too
late
or
of
its
not
having
been
planted
at
all
these
two
vexations
combined
might
well
make
him
leave
off
eating
and
drinking
this
was
the
case
on
the
fourth
day
it
was
pitiful
to
see
cornelius
dumb
with
grief
and
pale
from
utter
prostration
stretch
out
his
head
through
the
iron
bars
of
his
window
at
the
risk
of
not
being
able
to
draw
it
back
again
to
try
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
garden
on
the
left
spoken
of
by
rosa
who
had
told
him
that
its
parapet
overlooked
the
river
he
hoped
that
perhaps
he
might
see
in
the
light
of
the
april
sun
rosa
or
the
tulip
the
two
lost
objects
of
his
love
in
the
evening
gryphus
took
away
the
breakfast
and
dinner
of
cornelius
who
had
scarcely
touched
them
on
the
following
day
he
did
not
touch
them
at
all
and
gryphus
carried
the
dishes
away
just
as
he
had
brought
them
cornelius
had
remained
in
bed
the
whole
day
well
said
gryphus
coming
down
from
the
last
visit
i
think
we
shall
soon
get
rid
of
our
rosa
was
startled
nonsense
said
jacob
what
do
you
mean
he
doesn
t
drink
he
doesn
t
eat
he
doesn
t
leave
his
bed
he
will
get
out
of
it
like
mynheer
grotius
in
a
chest
only
the
chest
will
be
a
rosa
grew
pale
as
death
ah
she
said
to
herself
he
is
uneasy
about
his
and
rising
with
a
heavy
heart
she
returned
to
her
chamber
where
she
took
a
pen
and
paper
and
during
the
whole
of
that
night
busied
herself
with
tracing
letters
on
the
following
morning
when
cornelius
got
up
to
drag
himself
to
the
window
he
perceived
a
paper
which
had
been
slipped
under
the
door
he
pounced
upon
it
opened
it
and
read
the
following
words
in
a
handwriting
which
he
could
scarcely
have
recognized
as
that
of
rosa
so
much
had
she
improved
during
her
short
absence
of
seven
days
be
easy
your
tulip
is
going
on
although
these
few
words
of
rosa
s
somewhat
soothed
the
grief
of
cornelius
yet
he
felt
not
the
less
the
irony
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
them
rosa
then
was
not
ill
she
was
offended
she
had
not
been
forcibly
prevented
from
coming
but
had
voluntarily
stayed
away
thus
rosa
being
at
liberty
found
in
her
own
will
the
force
not
to
come
and
see
him
who
was
dying
with
grief
at
not
having
seen
her
cornelius
had
paper
and
a
pencil
which
rosa
had
brought
to
him
he
guessed
that
she
expected
an
answer
but
that
she
would
not
come
before
the
evening
to
fetch
it
he
therefore
wrote
on
a
piece
of
paper
similar
to
that
which
he
had
received
it
was
not
my
anxiety
about
the
tulip
that
has
made
me
ill
but
the
grief
at
not
seeing
after
gryphus
had
made
his
last
visit
of
the
day
and
darkness
had
set
in
he
slipped
the
paper
under
the
door
and
listened
with
the
most
intense
attention
but
he
neither
heard
rosa
s
footsteps
nor
the
rustling
of
her
gown
he
only
heard
a
voice
as
feeble
as
a
breath
and
gentle
like
a
caress
which
whispered
through
the
grated
little
window
in
the
door
the
word
now
was
the
eighth
day
for
eight
days
cornelius
and
rosa
had
not
seen
each
other
chapter
the
events
which
took
place
during
those
eight
days
on
the
following
evening
at
the
usual
hour
van
baerle
heard
some
one
scratch
at
the
grated
little
window
just
as
rosa
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
in
the
heyday
of
their
friendship
cornelius
being
as
may
easily
be
imagined
not
far
off
from
the
door
perceived
rosa
who
at
last
was
waiting
again
for
him
with
her
lamp
in
her
hand
seeing
him
so
sad
and
pale
she
was
startled
and
said
you
are
ill
mynheer
cornelius
yes
i
am
he
answered
as
indeed
he
was
suffering
in
mind
and
in
body
i
saw
that
you
did
not
eat
said
rosa
my
father
told
me
that
you
remained
in
bed
all
day
i
then
wrote
to
calm
your
uneasiness
concerning
the
fate
of
the
most
precious
object
of
your
and
i
said
cornelius
i
have
answered
seeing
your
return
my
dear
rosa
i
thought
you
had
received
my
it
is
true
i
have
received
you
can
not
this
time
excuse
yourself
with
not
being
able
to
read
not
only
do
you
read
very
fluently
but
also
you
have
made
marvellous
progress
in
indeed
i
have
not
only
received
but
also
read
your
note
accordingly
i
am
come
to
see
whether
there
might
not
be
some
remedy
to
restore
you
to
restore
me
to
health
cried
cornelius
but
have
you
any
good
news
to
communicate
to
me
saying
this
the
poor
prisoner
looked
at
rosa
his
eyes
sparkling
with
hope
whether
she
did
not
or
would
not
understand
this
look
rosa
answered
gravely
i
have
only
to
speak
to
you
about
your
tulip
which
as
i
well
know
is
the
object
uppermost
in
your
rosa
pronounced
those
few
words
in
a
freezing
tone
which
cut
deeply
into
the
heart
of
cornelius
he
did
not
suspect
what
lay
hidden
under
this
appearance
of
indifference
with
which
the
poor
girl
affected
to
speak
of
her
rival
the
black
tulip
oh
muttered
cornelius
again
again
have
i
not
told
you
rosa
that
i
thought
but
of
you
that
it
was
you
alone
whom
i
regretted
you
whom
i
missed
you
whose
absence
i
felt
more
than
the
loss
of
liberty
and
of
life
itself
rosa
smiled
with
a
melancholy
air
ah
she
said
your
tulip
has
been
in
such
cornelius
trembled
involuntarily
and
showed
himself
clearly
to
be
caught
in
the
trap
if
ever
the
remark
was
meant
as
such
danger
he
cried
quite
alarmed
what
danger
rosa
looked
at
him
with
gentle
compassion
she
felt
that
what
she
wished
was
beyond
the
power
of
this
man
and
that
he
must
be
taken
as
he
was
with
his
little
foible
yes
she
said
you
have
guessed
the
truth
that
suitor
and
amorous
swain
jacob
did
not
come
on
my
and
what
did
he
come
for
cornelius
anxiously
asked
he
came
for
the
sake
of
the
alas
said
cornelius
growing
even
paler
at
this
piece
of
information
than
he
had
been
when
rosa
a
fortnight
before
had
told
him
that
jacob
was
coming
for
her
sake
rosa
saw
this
alarm
and
cornelius
guessed
from
the
expression
of
her
face
in
what
direction
her
thoughts
were
running
oh
pardon
me
rosa
he
said
i
know
you
and
i
am
well
aware
of
the
kindness
and
sincerity
of
your
heart
to
you
god
has
given
the
thought
and
strength
for
defending
yourself
but
to
my
poor
tulip
when
it
is
in
danger
god
has
given
nothing
of
the
rosa
without
replying
to
this
excuse
of
the
prisoner
continued
from
the
moment
when
i
first
knew
that
you
were
uneasy
on
account
of
the
man
who
followed
me
and
in
whom
i
had
recognized
jacob
i
was
even
more
uneasy
myself
on
the
day
therefore
after
that
on
which
i
saw
you
last
and
on
which
you
said
cornelius
interrupted
her
once
more
pardon
me
rosa
he
cried
i
was
wrong
in
saying
to
you
what
i
said
i
have
asked
your
pardon
for
that
unfortunate
speech
before
i
ask
it
again
shall
i
always
ask
it
in
vain
on
the
following
day
rosa
continued
remembering
what
you
had
told
me
about
the
stratagem
which
i
was
to
employ
to
ascertain
whether
that
odious
man
was
after
the
tulip
or
after
me
yes
yes
odious
tell
me
he
said
do
you
hate
that
man
i
do
hate
him
said
rosa
as
he
is
the
cause
of
all
the
unhappiness
i
have
suffered
these
eight
you
too
have
been
unhappy
rosa
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
for
this
kind
well
on
the
day
after
that
unfortunate
one
i
went
down
into
the
garden
and
proceeded
towards
the
border
where
i
was
to
plant
your
tulip
looking
round
all
the
while
to
see
whether
i
was
again
followed
as
i
was
last
and
then
cornelius
asked
and
then
the
same
shadow
glided
between
the
gate
and
the
wall
and
once
more
disappeared
behind
the
you
feigned
not
to
see
him
didn
t
you
cornelius
asked
remembering
all
the
details
of
the
advice
which
he
had
given
to
rosa
yes
and
i
stooped
over
the
border
in
which
i
dug
with
a
spade
as
if
i
was
going
to
put
the
bulb
and
he
what
did
he
do
during
all
this
time
i
saw
his
eyes
glisten
through
the
branches
of
the
tree
like
those
of
a
there
you
see
there
you
see
cried
cornelius
then
after
having
finished
my
work
i
but
only
behind
the
garden
door
i
dare
say
so
that
you
might
see
through
the
keyhole
what
he
was
going
to
do
when
you
had
left
he
waited
for
a
moment
very
likely
to
make
sure
of
my
not
coming
back
after
which
he
sneaked
forth
from
his
and
approached
the
border
by
a
long
at
last
having
reached
his
goal
that
is
to
say
the
spot
where
the
ground
was
newly
turned
he
stopped
with
a
careless
air
looking
about
in
all
directions
and
scanning
every
corner
of
the
garden
every
window
of
the
neighbouring
houses
and
even
the
sky
after
which
thinking
himself
quite
alone
quite
isolated
and
out
of
everybody
s
sight
he
pounced
upon
the
border
plunged
both
his
hands
into
the
soft
soil
took
a
handful
of
the
mould
which
he
gently
frittered
between
his
fingers
to
see
whether
the
bulb
was
in
it
and
repeated
the
same
thing
twice
or
three
times
until
at
last
he
perceived
that
he
was
outwitted
then
keeping
down
the
agitation
which
was
raging
in
his
breast
he
took
up
the
rake
smoothed
the
ground
so
as
to
leave
it
on
his
retiring
in
the
same
state
as
he
had
found
it
and
quite
abashed
and
rueful
walked
back
to
the
door
affecting
the
unconcerned
air
of
an
ordinary
visitor
of
the
oh
the
wretch
muttered
cornelius
wiping
the
cold
sweat
from
his
brow
oh
the
wretch
i
guessed
his
intentions
but
the
bulb
rosa
what
have
you
done
with
it
it
is
already
rather
late
to
plant
the
bulb
it
has
been
in
the
ground
for
these
six
where
and
how
cried
cornelius
good
heaven
what
imprudence
what
is
it
in
what
sort
of
soil
is
it
in
what
aspect
good
or
bad
is
there
no
risk
of
having
it
filched
by
that
detestable
jacob
there
is
no
danger
of
its
being
stolen
said
rosa
unless
jacob
will
force
the
door
of
my
oh
then
it
is
with
you
in
your
bedroom
said
cornelius
somewhat
relieved
but
in
what
soil
in
what
vessel
you
don
t
let
it
grow
i
hope
in
water
like
those
good
ladies
of
haarlem
and
dort
who
imagine
that
water
could
replace
the
earth
you
may
make
yourself
comfortable
on
that
score
said
rosa
smiling
your
bulb
is
not
growing
in
i
breathe
it
is
in
a
good
sound
stone
pot
just
about
the
size
of
the
jug
in
which
you
had
planted
yours
the
soil
is
composed
of
three
parts
of
common
mould
taken
from
the
best
spot
of
the
garden
and
one
of
the
sweepings
of
the
road
i
have
heard
you
and
that
detestable
jacob
as
you
call
him
so
often
talk
about
what
is
the
soil
best
fitted
for
growing
tulips
that
i
know
it
as
well
as
the
first
gardener
of
and
now
what
is
the
aspect
rosa
at
present
it
has
the
sun
all
day
long
that
is
to
say
when
the
sun
shines
but
when
it
once
peeps
out
of
the
ground
i
shall
do
as
you
have
done
here
dear
mynheer
cornelius
i
shall
put
it
out
of
my
window
on
the
eastern
side
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
eleven
and
in
my
window
towards
the
west
from
three
to
five
in
the
that
s
it
that
s
it
cried
cornelius
and
you
are
a
perfect
gardener
my
pretty
rosa
but
i
am
afraid
the
nursing
of
my
tulip
will
take
up
all
your
yes
it
will
said
rosa
but
never
mind
your
tulip
is
my
daughter
i
shall
devote
to
it
the
same
time
as
i
should
to
a
child
of
mine
if
i
were
a
mother
only
by
becoming
its
mother
rosa
added
smilingly
can
i
cease
to
be
its
my
kind
and
pretty
rosa
muttered
cornelius
casting
on
her
a
glance
in
which
there
was
much
more
of
the
lover
than
of
the
gardener
and
which
afforded
rosa
some
consolation
then
after
a
silence
of
some
moments
during
which
cornelius
had
grasped
through
the
openings
of
the
grating
for
the
receding
hand
of
rosa
he
said
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
bulb
has
now
been
in
the
ground
for
six
days
yes
six
days
mynheer
cornelius
she
answered
and
it
does
not
yet
show
leaf
no
but
i
think
it
will
well
then
you
will
bring
me
news
about
it
and
about
yourself
won
t
you
rosa
i
care
very
much
for
the
daughter
as
you
called
it
just
now
but
i
care
even
much
more
for
the
said
rosa
looking
at
cornelius
askance
i
don
t
know
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
come
good
heavens
said
cornelius
why
can
t
you
come
mynheer
cornelius
i
have
lots
of
things
to
and
i
have
only
one
muttered
cornelius
yes
said
rosa
to
love
your
to
love
you
rosa
shook
her
head
after
which
followed
a
pause
well
cornelius
at
last
broke
the
silence
well
rosa
everything
changes
in
the
realm
of
nature
the
flowers
of
spring
are
succeeded
by
other
flowers
and
the
bees
which
so
tenderly
caressed
the
violets
and
the
will
flutter
with
just
as
much
love
about
the
the
rose
the
jessamine
and
the
what
does
all
this
mean
asked
rosa
you
have
abandoned
me
miss
rosa
to
seek
your
pleasure
elsewhere
you
have
done
well
and
i
will
not
complain
what
claim
have
i
to
your
fidelity
my
fidelity
rosa
exclaimed
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
without
caring
any
longer
to
hide
from
cornelius
this
dew
of
pearls
dropping
on
her
cheeks
my
fidelity
have
i
not
been
faithful
to
you
do
you
call
it
faithful
to
desert
me
and
to
leave
me
here
to
die
but
mynheer
cornelius
said
rosa
am
i
not
doing
everything
for
you
that
could
give
you
pleasure
have
i
not
devoted
myself
to
your
tulip
you
are
bitter
rosa
you
reproach
me
with
the
only
unalloyed
pleasure
which
i
have
had
in
this
i
reproach
you
with
nothing
mynheer
cornelius
except
perhaps
with
the
intense
grief
which
i
felt
when
people
came
to
tell
me
at
the
buytenhof
that
you
were
about
to
be
put
to
you
are
displeased
rosa
my
sweet
girl
with
my
loving
i
am
not
displeased
with
your
loving
them
mynheer
cornelius
only
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
that
you
love
them
better
than
you
do
oh
my
dear
dear
rosa
look
how
my
hands
tremble
look
at
my
pale
cheek
hear
how
my
heart
beats
it
is
for
you
my
love
not
for
the
black
tulip
destroy
the
bulb
destroy
the
germ
of
that
flower
extinguish
the
gentle
light
of
that
innocent
and
delightful
dream
to
which
i
have
accustomed
myself
but
love
me
rosa
love
me
for
i
feel
deeply
that
i
love
but
yes
after
the
black
tulip
sighed
rosa
who
at
last
no
longer
coyly
withdrew
her
warm
hands
from
the
grating
as
cornelius
most
affectionately
kissed
them
above
and
before
everything
in
this
world
may
i
believe
you
as
you
believe
in
your
own
well
then
be
it
so
but
loving
me
does
not
bind
you
too
unfortunately
it
does
not
bind
me
more
than
i
am
bound
but
it
binds
you
rosa
to
what
first
of
all
not
to
she
smiled
that
s
your
way
she
said
you
are
tyrants
all
of
you
you
worship
a
certain
beauty
you
think
of
nothing
but
her
then
you
are
condemned
to
death
and
whilst
walking
to
the
scaffold
you
devote
to
her
your
last
sigh
and
now
you
expect
poor
me
to
sacrifice
to
you
all
my
dreams
and
my
but
who
is
the
beauty
you
are
talking
of
rosa
said
cornelius
trying
in
vain
to
remember
a
woman
to
whom
rosa
might
possibly
be
alluding
the
dark
beauty
with
a
slender
waist
small
feet
and
a
noble
head
in
short
i
am
speaking
of
your
cornelius
smiled
that
is
an
imaginary
lady
love
at
all
events
whereas
without
counting
that
amorous
jacob
you
by
your
own
account
are
surrounded
with
all
sorts
of
swains
eager
to
make
love
to
you
do
you
remember
rosa
what
you
told
me
of
the
students
officers
and
clerks
of
the
hague
are
there
no
clerks
officers
or
students
at
loewestein
indeed
there
are
and
lots
of
who
write
letters
they
do
and
now
as
you
know
how
to
read
here
cornelius
heaved
a
sigh
at
the
thought
that
poor
captive
as
he
was
to
him
alone
rosa
owed
the
faculty
of
reading
the
which
she
received
as
to
that
said
rosa
i
think
that
in
reading
the
notes
addressed
to
me
and
passing
the
different
swains
in
review
who
send
them
to
me
i
am
only
following
your
how
so
my
instructions
indeed
your
instructions
sir
said
rosa
sighing
in
her
turn
have
you
forgotten
the
will
written
by
your
hand
on
the
bible
of
cornelius
de
witt
i
have
not
forgotten
it
for
now
as
i
know
how
to
read
i
read
it
every
day
over
and
over
again
in
that
will
you
bid
me
to
love
and
marry
a
handsome
young
man
of
or
eight
years
i
am
on
the
for
that
young
man
and
as
the
whole
of
my
day
is
taken
up
with
your
tulip
you
must
needs
leave
me
the
evenings
to
find
but
rosa
the
will
was
made
in
the
expectation
of
death
and
thanks
to
heaven
i
am
still
well
then
i
shall
not
be
after
the
handsome
young
man
and
i
shall
come
to
see
that
s
it
rosa
come
come
under
one
granted
beforehand
that
the
black
tulip
shall
not
be
mentioned
for
the
next
three
it
shall
never
be
mentioned
any
more
if
you
wish
it
no
no
the
damsel
said
laughing
i
will
not
ask
for
and
saying
this
she
brought
her
fresh
cheek
as
if
unconsciously
so
near
the
iron
grating
that
cornelius
was
able
to
touch
it
with
his
lips
rosa
uttered
a
little
scream
which
however
was
full
of
love
and
disappeared
chapter
the
second
bulb
the
night
was
a
happy
one
and
the
whole
of
the
next
day
happier
still
during
the
last
few
days
the
prison
had
been
heavy
dark
and
lowering
as
it
were
with
all
its
weight
on
the
unfortunate
captive
its
walls
were
black
its
air
chilling
the
iron
bars
seemed
to
exclude
every
ray
of
light
but
when
cornelius
awoke
next
morning
a
beam
of
the
morning
sun
was
playing
about
those
iron
bars
pigeons
were
hovering
about
with
outspread
wings
whilst
others
were
lovingly
cooing
on
the
roof
or
near
the
still
closed
window
cornelius
ran
to
that
window
and
opened
it
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
new
life
and
joy
and
liberty
itself
were
entering
with
this
sunbeam
into
his
cell
which
so
dreary
of
late
was
now
cheered
and
irradiated
by
the
light
of
love
when
gryphus
therefore
came
to
see
his
prisoner
in
the
morning
he
no
longer
found
him
morose
and
lying
in
bed
but
standing
at
the
window
and
singing
a
little
ditty
halloa
exclaimed
the
jailer
how
are
you
this
morning
asked
cornelius
gryphus
looked
at
him
with
a
scowl
and
how
is
the
dog
and
master
jacob
and
our
pretty
rosa
gryphus
ground
his
teeth
saying
here
is
your
thank
you
friend
cerberus
said
the
prisoner
you
are
just
in
time
i
am
very
oh
you
are
hungry
are
you
said
gryphus
and
why
not
asked
van
baerle
the
conspiracy
seems
to
thrive
remarked
gryphus
what
conspiracy
very
well
i
know
what
i
know
master
scholar
just
be
quiet
we
shall
be
on
our
be
on
your
guard
friend
gryphus
be
on
your
guard
as
long
as
you
please
my
conspiracy
as
well
as
my
person
is
entirely
at
your
we
ll
see
that
at
saying
this
gryphus
went
out
at
noon
repeated
cornelius
what
does
that
mean
well
let
us
wait
until
the
clock
strikes
twelve
and
we
shall
it
was
very
easy
for
cornelius
to
wait
for
twelve
at
midday
as
he
was
already
waiting
for
nine
at
night
it
struck
twelve
and
there
were
heard
on
the
staircase
not
only
the
steps
of
gryphus
but
also
those
of
three
or
four
soldiers
who
were
coming
up
with
him
the
door
opened
gryphus
entered
led
his
men
in
and
shut
the
door
after
them
there
now
search
they
searched
not
only
the
pockets
of
cornelius
but
even
his
person
yet
they
found
nothing
they
then
searched
the
sheets
the
mattress
and
the
straw
mattress
of
his
bed
and
again
they
found
nothing
now
cornelius
rejoiced
that
he
had
not
taken
the
third
sucker
under
his
own
care
gryphus
would
have
been
sure
to
ferret
it
out
in
the
search
and
would
then
have
treated
it
as
he
did
the
first
and
certainly
never
did
prisoner
look
with
greater
complacency
at
a
search
made
in
his
cell
than
cornelius
gryphus
retired
with
the
pencil
and
the
two
or
three
leaves
of
white
paper
which
rosa
had
given
to
van
baerle
this
was
the
only
trophy
brought
back
from
the
expedition
at
six
gryphus
came
back
again
but
alone
cornelius
tried
to
propitiate
him
but
gryphus
growled
showed
a
large
tooth
like
a
tusk
which
he
had
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
went
out
backwards
like
a
man
who
is
afraid
of
being
attacked
from
behind
cornelius
burst
out
laughing
to
which
gryphus
answered
through
the
grating
let
him
laugh
that
the
winner
that
day
was
cornelius
rosa
came
at
nine
she
was
without
a
lantern
she
needed
no
longer
a
light
as
she
could
now
read
moreover
the
light
might
betray
her
as
jacob
was
dogging
her
steps
more
than
ever
and
lastly
the
light
would
have
shown
her
blushes
of
what
did
the
young
people
speak
that
evening
of
those
matters
of
which
lovers
speak
at
the
house
doors
in
france
or
from
a
balcony
into
the
street
in
spain
or
down
from
a
terrace
into
a
garden
in
the
east
they
spoke
of
those
things
which
give
wings
to
the
hours
they
spoke
of
everything
except
the
black
tulip
at
last
when
the
clock
struck
ten
they
parted
as
usual
cornelius
was
happy
as
thoroughly
happy
as
a
would
be
to
whom
one
has
not
spoken
of
his
tulip
he
found
rosa
pretty
good
graceful
and
charming
but
why
did
rosa
object
to
the
tulip
being
spoken
of
this
was
indeed
a
great
defect
in
rosa
cornelius
confessed
to
himself
sighing
that
woman
was
not
perfect
part
of
the
night
he
thought
of
this
imperfection
that
is
to
say
so
long
as
he
was
awake
he
thought
of
rosa
after
having
fallen
asleep
he
dreamed
of
her
but
the
rosa
of
his
dreams
was
by
far
more
perfect
than
the
rosa
of
real
life
not
only
did
the
rosa
of
his
dreams
speak
of
the
tulip
but
also
brought
to
him
a
black
one
in
a
china
vase
cornelius
then
awoke
trembling
with
joy
and
muttering
rosa
rosa
i
love
and
as
it
was
already
day
he
thought
it
right
not
to
fall
asleep
again
and
he
continued
following
up
the
line
of
thought
in
which
his
mind
was
engaged
when
he
awoke
ah
if
rosa
had
only
conversed
about
the
tulip
cornelius
would
have
preferred
her
to
queen
semiramis
to
queen
cleopatra
to
queen
elizabeth
to
queen
anne
of
austria
that
is
to
say
to
the
greatest
or
most
beautiful
queens
whom
the
world
has
seen
but
rosa
had
forbidden
it
under
pain
of
not
returning
rosa
had
forbidden
the
least
mention
of
the
tulip
for
three
days
that
meant
hours
given
to
the
lover
to
be
sure
but
it
was
hours
stolen
from
the
horticulturist
there
was
one
consolation
of
the
hours
during
which
rosa
would
not
allow
the
tulip
to
be
mentioned
had
passed
already
and
the
remaining
would
pass
quickly
enough
eighteen
with
waiting
for
the
evening
s
interview
and
eighteen
with
rejoicing
in
its
remembrance
rosa
came
at
the
same
hour
and
cornelius
submitted
most
heroically
to
the
pangs
which
the
compulsory
silence
concerning
the
tulip
gave
him
his
fair
visitor
however
was
well
aware
that
to
command
on
the
one
point
people
must
yield
on
another
she
therefore
no
longer
drew
back
her
hands
from
the
grating
and
even
allowed
cornelius
tenderly
to
kiss
her
beautiful
golden
tresses
poor
girl
she
had
no
idea
that
these
playful
little
lovers
tricks
were
much
more
dangerous
than
speaking
of
the
tulip
was
but
she
became
aware
of
the
fact
as
she
returned
with
a
beating
heart
with
glowing
cheeks
dry
lips
and
moist
eyes
and
on
the
following
evening
after
the
first
exchange
of
salutations
she
retired
a
step
looking
at
him
with
a
glance
the
expression
of
which
would
have
rejoiced
his
heart
could
he
but
have
seen
it
well
she
said
she
is
she
is
up
who
what
asked
cornelius
who
did
not
venture
on
a
belief
that
rosa
would
of
her
own
accord
have
abridged
the
term
of
his
probation
she
well
my
daughter
the
tulip
said
rosa
what
cried
cornelius
you
give
me
permission
then
i
do
said
rosa
with
the
tone
of
an
affectionate
mother
who
grants
a
pleasure
to
her
child
ah
rosa
said
cornelius
putting
his
lips
to
the
grating
with
the
hope
of
touching
a
cheek
a
hand
a
forehead
anything
in
short
he
touched
something
much
better
two
warm
and
half
open
lips
rosa
uttered
a
slight
scream
cornelius
understood
that
he
must
make
haste
to
continue
the
conversation
he
guessed
that
this
unexpected
kiss
had
frightened
rosa
is
it
growing
up
straight
straight
as
a
rocket
said
rosa
how
high
at
least
two
oh
rosa
take
good
care
of
it
and
we
shall
soon
see
it
grow
can
i
take
more
care
of
it
said
she
indeed
i
think
of
nothing
else
but
the
of
nothing
else
rosa
why
now
i
shall
grow
jealous
in
my
oh
you
know
that
to
think
of
the
tulip
is
to
think
of
you
i
never
lose
sight
of
it
i
see
it
from
my
bed
on
awaking
it
is
the
first
object
that
meets
my
eyes
and
on
falling
asleep
the
last
on
which
they
rest
during
the
day
i
sit
and
work
by
its
side
for
i
have
never
left
my
chamber
since
i
put
it
you
are
right
rosa
it
is
your
dowry
you
yes
and
with
it
i
may
marry
a
young
man
of
or
years
whom
i
shall
be
in
love
don
t
talk
in
that
way
you
naughty
that
evening
cornelius
was
one
of
the
happiest
of
men
rosa
allowed
him
to
press
her
hand
in
his
and
to
keep
it
as
long
as
he
would
besides
which
he
might
talk
of
his
tulip
as
much
as
he
liked
from
that
hour
every
day
marked
some
progress
in
the
growth
of
the
tulip
and
in
the
affection
of
the
two
young
people
at
one
time
it
was
that
the
leaves
had
expanded
and
at
another
that
the
flower
itself
had
formed
great
was
the
joy
of
cornelius
at
this
news
and
his
questions
succeeded
one
another
with
a
rapidity
which
gave
proof
of
their
importance
formed
exclaimed
cornelius
is
it
really
formed
it
is
repeated
rosa
cornelius
trembled
with
joy
so
much
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
hold
by
the
grating
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
then
turning
again
to
rosa
he
continued
his
questions
is
the
oval
regular
the
cylinder
full
and
are
the
points
very
green
the
oval
is
almost
one
inch
long
and
tapers
like
a
needle
the
cylinder
swells
at
the
sides
and
the
points
are
ready
to
two
days
after
rosa
announced
that
they
were
open
open
rosa
cried
cornelius
is
the
involucrum
open
but
then
one
may
see
and
already
distinguish
here
the
prisoner
paused
anxiously
taking
breath
yes
answered
rosa
one
may
already
distinguish
a
thread
of
different
colour
as
thin
as
a
and
its
colour
asked
cornelius
trembling
oh
answered
rosa
it
is
very
dark
brown
darker
than
darker
my
good
rosa
darker
thank
you
dark
as
dark
as
the
ink
with
which
i
wrote
to
cornelius
uttered
a
cry
of
mad
joy
then
suddenly
stopping
and
clasping
his
hands
he
said
oh
there
is
not
an
angel
in
heaven
that
may
be
compared
to
you
rosa
indeed
said
rosa
smiling
at
his
enthusiasm
rosa
you
have
worked
with
such
ardour
you
have
done
so
much
for
me
rosa
my
tulip
is
about
to
flower
and
it
will
flower
black
rosa
rosa
you
are
the
most
perfect
being
on
earth
after
the
tulip
ah
be
quiet
you
malicious
little
creature
be
quiet
for
shame
do
not
spoil
my
pleasure
but
tell
me
rosa
as
the
tulip
is
so
far
advanced
it
will
flower
in
two
or
three
days
at
the
latest
or
the
day
ah
and
i
shall
not
see
it
cried
cornelius
starting
back
i
shall
not
kiss
it
as
a
wonderful
work
of
the
almighty
as
i
kiss
your
hand
and
your
cheek
rosa
when
by
chance
they
are
near
the
rosa
drew
near
not
by
accident
but
intentionally
and
cornelius
kissed
her
tenderly
faith
i
shall
cull
it
if
you
wish
oh
no
no
rosa
when
it
is
open
place
it
carefully
in
the
shade
and
immediately
send
a
message
to
haarlem
to
the
president
of
the
horticultural
society
that
the
grand
black
tulip
is
in
flower
i
know
well
it
is
far
to
haarlem
but
with
money
you
will
find
a
messenger
have
you
any
money
rosa
rosa
smiled
oh
yes
she
said
enough
said
cornelius
i
have
three
hundred
oh
if
you
have
three
hundred
guilders
you
must
not
send
a
messenger
rosa
but
you
must
go
to
haarlem
but
what
in
the
meantime
is
to
become
of
the
flower
oh
the
flower
you
must
take
it
with
you
you
understand
that
you
must
not
separate

i
am
separating
from
you
mynheer
ah
that
s
true
my
sweet
rosa
oh
my
god
how
wicked
men
are
what
have
i
done
to
offend
them
and
why
have
they
deprived
me
of
my
liberty
you
are
right
rosa
i
can
not
live
without
you
well
you
will
send
some
one
to
haarlem
that
s
settled
really
the
matter
is
wonderful
enough
for
the
president
to
put
himself
to
some
trouble
he
will
come
himself
to
loewestein
to
see
the
then
suddenly
checking
himself
he
said
with
a
faltering
voice
rosa
rosa
if
after
all
it
should
not
flower
black
oh
surely
surely
you
will
know
or
the
day
and
to
wait
until
evening
to
know
it
rosa
i
shall
die
with
impatience
could
we
not
agree
about
a
signal
i
shall
do
better
than
what
will
you
do
if
it
opens
at
night
i
shall
come
and
tell
you
myself
if
it
is
day
i
shall
pass
your
door
and
slip
you
a
note
either
under
the
door
or
through
the
grating
during
the
time
between
my
father
s
first
and
second
yes
rosa
let
it
be
so
one
word
of
yours
announcing
this
news
to
me
will
be
a
double
there
ten
o
clock
strikes
said
rosa
i
must
now
leave
yes
yes
said
cornelius
go
rosa
go
rosa
withdrew
almost
melancholy
for
cornelius
had
all
but
sent
her
away
it
is
true
that
he
did
so
in
order
that
she
might
watch
over
his
black
tulip
chapter
the
opening
of
the
flower
the
night
passed
away
very
sweetly
for
cornelius
although
in
great
agitation
every
instant
he
fancied
he
heard
the
gentle
voice
of
rosa
calling
him
he
then
started
up
went
to
the
door
and
looked
through
the
grating
but
no
one
was
behind
it
and
the
lobby
was
empty
rosa
no
doubt
would
be
watching
too
but
happier
than
he
she
watched
over
the
tulip
she
had
before
her
eyes
that
noble
flower
that
wonder
of
wonders
which
not
only
was
unknown
but
was
not
even
thought
possible
until
then
what
would
the
world
say
when
it
heard
that
the
black
tulip
was
found
that
it
existed
and
that
it
was
the
prisoner
van
baerle
who
had
found
it
how
cornelius
would
have
spurned
the
offer
of
his
liberty
in
exchange
for
his
tulip
day
came
without
any
news
the
tulip
was
not
yet
in
flower
the
day
passed
as
the
night
night
came
and
with
it
rosa
joyous
and
cheerful
as
a
bird
well
asked
cornelius
well
all
is
going
on
prosperously
this
night
without
any
doubt
our
tulip
will
be
in
and
will
it
flower
black
black
as
without
a
speck
of
any
other
without
one
good
heavens
my
dear
rosa
i
have
been
dreaming
all
night
in
the
first
place
of
you
rosa
made
a
sign
of
incredulity
and
then
of
what
we
must
well
well
and
i
will
tell
you
now
what
i
have
decided
on
the
tulip
once
being
in
flower
and
it
being
quite
certain
that
it
is
perfectly
black
you
must
find
a
if
it
is
no
more
than
that
i
have
a
messenger
quite
is
he
safe
one
for
whom
i
will
answer
he
is
one
of
my
i
hope
not
no
be
quiet
it
is
the
ferryman
of
loewestein
a
smart
young
man
of
by
jove
be
quiet
said
rosa
smiling
he
is
still
under
age
as
you
have
yourself
fixed
it
from
to
in
fine
do
you
think
you
may
rely
on
this
young
man
as
on
myself
he
would
throw
himself
into
the
waal
or
the
meuse
if
i
bade
well
rosa
this
lad
may
be
at
haarlem
in
ten
hours
you
will
give
me
paper
and
pencil
and
perhaps
better
still
pen
and
ink
and
i
will
write
or
rather
on
second
thoughts
you
will
for
if
i
did
being
a
poor
prisoner
people
might
like
your
father
see
a
conspiracy
in
it
you
will
write
to
the
president
of
the
horticultural
society
and
i
am
sure
he
will
but
if
he
tarries
well
let
us
suppose
that
he
tarries
one
day
or
even
two
but
it
is
impossible
a
like
him
will
not
tarry
one
hour
not
one
minute
not
one
second
to
set
out
to
see
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
but
as
i
said
if
he
tarried
one
or
even
two
days
the
tulip
will
still
be
in
its
full
splendour
the
flower
once
being
seen
by
the
president
and
the
protocol
being
drawn
up
all
is
in
order
you
will
only
keep
a
duplicate
of
the
protocol
and
intrust
the
tulip
to
him
ah
if
we
had
been
able
to
carry
it
ourselves
rosa
it
would
never
have
left
my
hands
but
to
pass
into
yours
but
this
is
a
dream
which
we
must
not
entertain
continued
cornelius
with
a
sigh
the
eyes
of
strangers
will
see
it
flower
to
the
last
and
above
all
rosa
before
the
president
has
seen
it
let
it
not
be
seen
by
any
one
alas
if
any
one
saw
the
black
tulip
it
would
be
oh
did
you
not
tell
me
yourself
of
what
you
apprehended
from
your
lover
jacob
people
will
steal
one
guilder
why
not
a
hundred
thousand
i
shall
watch
be
but
if
it
opened
whilst
you
were
here
the
whimsical
little
thing
would
indeed
be
quite
capable
of
playing
such
a
trick
said
rosa
and
if
on
your
return
you
find
it
open
well
oh
rosa
whenever
it
opens
remember
that
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
in
apprising
the
and
in
apprising
you
yes
i
rosa
sighed
yet
without
any
bitter
feeling
but
rather
like
a
woman
who
begins
to
understand
a
foible
and
to
accustom
herself
to
it
i
return
to
your
tulip
mynheer
van
baerle
and
as
soon
as
it
opens
i
will
give
you
news
which
being
done
the
messenger
will
set
out
rosa
rosa
i
don
t
know
to
what
wonder
under
the
sun
i
shall
compare
compare
me
to
the
black
tulip
and
i
promise
you
i
shall
feel
very
much
flattered
good
night
then
till
we
meet
again
mynheer
oh
say
good
night
my
good
night
my
friend
said
rosa
a
little
consoled
say
my
very
dear
oh
my
friend
very
dear
friend
i
entreat
you
say
very
dear
rosa
very
very
dear
yes
very
dear
said
rosa
with
a
beating
heart
beyond
herself
with
happiness
and
now
that
you
have
said
very
dear
dear
rosa
say
also
most
happy
say
happier
and
more
blessed
than
ever
man
was
under
the
i
only
lack
one
thing
and
that
is
your
cheek
your
fresh
cheek
your
soft
rosy
cheek
oh
rosa
give
it
me
of
your
own
free
will
and
not
by
chance
ah
the
prisoner
s
prayer
ended
in
a
sigh
of
ecstasy
his
lips
met
those
of
the
maiden
not
by
chance
nor
by
stratagem
but
as
s
was
to
meet
the
lips
of
julie
a
hundred
years
later
rosa
made
her
escape
cornelius
stood
with
his
heart
upon
his
lips
and
his
face
glued
to
the
wicket
in
the
door
he
was
fairly
choking
with
happiness
and
joy
he
opened
his
window
and
gazed
long
with
swelling
heart
at
the
cloudless
vault
of
heaven
and
the
moon
which
shone
like
silver
upon
the
stream
flowing
from
far
beyond
the
hills
he
filled
his
lungs
with
the
pure
sweet
air
while
his
brain
dwelt
upon
thoughts
of
happiness
and
his
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
religious
fervour
oh
thou
art
always
watching
from
on
high
my
god
he
cried
half
prostrate
his
glowing
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stars
forgive
me
that
i
almost
doubted
thy
existence
during
these
latter
days
for
thou
didst
hide
thy
face
behind
the
clouds
and
wert
for
a
moment
lost
to
my
sight
o
thou
merciful
god
thou
pitying
father
everlasting
but
this
evening
and
again
i
see
thee
in
all
thy
wondrous
glory
in
the
mirror
of
thy
heavenly
abode
and
more
clearly
still
in
the
mirror
of
my
grateful
he
was
well
again
the
poor
invalid
the
wretched
captive
was
free
once
more
during
part
of
the
night
cornelius
with
his
heart
full
of
joy
and
delight
remained
at
his
window
gazing
at
the
stars
and
listening
for
every
sound
then
casting
a
glance
from
time
to
time
towards
the
lobby
down
there
he
said
is
rosa
watching
like
myself
and
waiting
from
minute
to
minute
down
there
under
rosa
s
eyes
is
the
mysterious
flower
which
lives
which
expands
which
opens
perhaps
rosa
holds
in
this
moment
the
stem
of
the
tulip
between
her
delicate
fingers
touch
it
gently
rosa
perhaps
she
touches
with
her
lips
its
expanding
chalice
touch
it
cautiously
rosa
your
lips
are
burning
yes
perhaps
at
this
moment
the
two
objects
of
my
dearest
love
caress
each
other
under
the
eye
of
at
this
moment
a
star
blazed
in
the
southern
sky
and
shot
through
the
whole
horizon
falling
down
as
it
were
on
the
fortress
of
loewestein
cornelius
felt
a
thrill
run
through
his
frame
ah
he
said
here
is
heaven
sending
a
soul
to
my
and
as
if
he
had
guessed
correctly
nearly
at
that
very
moment
the
prisoner
heard
in
the
lobby
a
step
light
as
that
of
a
sylph
and
the
rustling
of
a
gown
and
a
voice
which
said
to
him
cornelius
my
friend
my
very
dear
friend
and
very
happy
friend
come
come
cornelius
darted
with
one
spring
from
the
window
to
the
door
his
lips
met
those
of
rosa
who
told
him
with
a
kiss
it
is
open
it
is
black
here
it
how
here
it
is
exclaimed
cornelius
yes
yes
we
ought
indeed
to
run
some
little
risk
to
give
a
great
joy
here
it
is
take
and
with
one
hand
she
raised
to
the
level
of
the
grating
a
dark
lantern
which
she
had
lit
in
the
meanwhile
whilst
with
the
other
she
held
to
the
same
height
the
miraculous
tulip
cornelius
uttered
a
cry
and
was
nearly
fainting
oh
muttered
he
my
god
my
god
thou
dost
reward
me
for
my
innocence
and
my
captivity
as
thou
hast
allowed
two
such
flowers
to
grow
at
the
grated
window
of
my
prison
the
tulip
was
beautiful
splendid
magnificent
its
stem
was
more
than
eighteen
inches
high
it
rose
from
out
of
four
green
leaves
which
were
as
smooth
and
straight
as
iron
the
whole
of
the
flower
was
as
black
and
shining
as
jet
rosa
said
cornelius
almost
gasping
rosa
there
is
not
one
moment
to
lose
in
writing
the
it
is
written
my
dearest
cornelius
said
rosa
is
it
indeed
whilst
the
tulip
opened
i
wrote
it
myself
for
i
did
not
wish
to
lose
a
moment
here
is
the
letter
and
tell
me
whether
you
approve
of
cornelius
took
the
letter
and
read
in
a
handwriting
which
was
much
improved
even
since
the
last
little
note
he
had
received
from
rosa
as
follows
mynheer
president
the
black
tulip
is
about
to
open
perhaps
in
ten
minutes
as
soon
as
it
is
open
i
shall
send
a
messenger
to
you
with
the
request
that
you
will
come
and
fetch
it
in
person
from
the
fortress
at
loewestein
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
jailer
gryphus
almost
as
much
of
a
captive
as
the
prisoners
of
my
father
i
can
not
therefore
bring
to
you
this
wonderful
flower
this
is
the
reason
why
i
beg
you
to
come
and
fetch
it
yourself
it
is
my
wish
that
it
should
be
called
rosa
barlœnsis
it
has
opened
it
is
perfectly
black
come
mynheer
president
come
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
humble
servant
rosa
gryphus
that
s
it
dear
rosa
that
s
it
your
letter
is
admirable
i
could
not
have
written
it
with
such
beautiful
simplicity
you
will
give
to
the
committee
all
the
information
that
will
be
required
of
you
they
will
then
know
how
the
tulip
has
been
grown
how
much
care
and
anxiety
and
how
many
sleepless
nights
it
has
cost
but
for
the
present
not
a
minute
must
be
lost
the
messenger
the
messenger
what
s
the
name
of
the
president
give
me
the
letter
i
will
direct
it
oh
he
is
very
well
known
it
is
mynheer
van
systens
the
burgomaster
of
haarlem
give
it
to
me
rosa
give
it
to
and
with
a
trembling
hand
cornelius
wrote
the
address
to
mynheer
peter
van
systens
burgomaster
and
president
of
the
horticultural
society
of
and
now
rosa
go
go
said
cornelius
and
let
us
implore
the
protection
of
god
who
has
so
kindly
watched
over
us
until
chapter
the
rival
and
in
fact
the
poor
young
people
were
in
great
need
of
protection
they
had
never
been
so
near
the
destruction
of
their
hopes
as
at
this
moment
when
they
thought
themselves
certain
of
their
fulfilment
the
reader
can
not
but
have
recognized
in
jacob
our
old
friend
or
rather
enemy
isaac
boxtel
and
has
guessed
no
doubt
that
this
worthy
had
followed
from
the
buytenhof
to
loewestein
the
object
of
his
love
and
the
object
of
his
hatred
the
black
tulip
and
cornelius
van
baerle
what
no
one
but
a
and
an
envious
could
have
discovered
the
existence
of
the
bulbs
and
the
endeavours
of
the
prisoner
jealousy
had
enabled
boxtel
if
not
to
discover
at
least
to
guess
we
have
seen
him
more
successful
under
the
name
of
jacob
than
under
that
of
isaac
gain
the
friendship
of
gryphus
which
for
several
months
he
cultivated
by
means
of
the
best
genièvre
ever
distilled
from
the
texel
to
antwerp
and
he
lulled
the
suspicion
of
the
jealous
turnkey
by
holding
out
to
him
the
flattering
prospect
of
his
designing
to
marry
rosa
besides
thus
offering
a
bait
to
the
ambition
of
the
father
he
managed
at
the
same
time
to
interest
his
zeal
as
a
jailer
picturing
to
him
in
the
blackest
colours
the
learned
prisoner
whom
gryphus
had
in
his
keeping
and
who
as
the
sham
jacob
had
it
was
in
league
with
satan
to
the
detriment
of
his
highness
the
prince
of
orange
at
first
he
had
also
made
some
way
with
rosa
not
indeed
in
her
affections
but
inasmuch
as
by
talking
to
her
of
marriage
and
of
love
he
had
evaded
all
the
suspicions
which
he
might
otherwise
have
excited
we
have
seen
how
his
imprudence
in
following
rosa
into
the
garden
had
unmasked
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
damsel
and
how
the
instinctive
fears
of
cornelius
had
put
the
two
lovers
on
their
guard
against
him
the
reader
will
remember
that
the
first
cause
of
uneasiness
was
given
to
the
prisoner
by
the
rage
of
jacob
when
gryphus
crushed
the
first
bulb
in
that
moment
boxtel
s
exasperation
was
the
more
fierce
as
though
suspecting
that
cornelius
possessed
a
second
bulb
he
by
no
means
felt
sure
of
it
from
that
moment
he
began
to
dodge
the
steps
of
rosa
not
only
following
her
to
the
garden
but
also
to
the
lobbies
only
as
this
time
he
followed
her
in
the
night
and
he
was
neither
seen
nor
heard
except
once
when
rosa
thought
she
saw
something
like
a
shadow
on
the
staircase
her
discovery
however
was
made
too
late
as
boxtel
had
heard
from
the
mouth
of
the
prisoner
himself
that
a
second
bulb
existed
taken
in
by
the
stratagem
of
rosa
who
had
feigned
to
put
it
in
the
ground
and
entertaining
no
doubt
that
this
little
farce
had
been
played
in
order
to
force
him
to
betray
himself
he
redoubled
his
precaution
and
employed
every
means
suggested
by
his
crafty
nature
to
watch
the
others
without
being
watched
himself
he
saw
rosa
conveying
a
large
of
white
earthenware
from
her
father
s
kitchen
to
her
bedroom
he
saw
rosa
washing
in
pails
of
water
her
pretty
little
hands
begrimed
as
they
were
with
the
mould
which
she
had
handled
to
give
her
tulip
the
best
soil
possible
and
at
last
he
hired
just
opposite
rosa
s
window
a
little
attic
distant
enough
not
to
allow
him
to
be
recognized
with
the
naked
eye
but
sufficiently
near
to
enable
him
with
the
help
of
his
telescope
to
watch
everything
that
was
going
on
at
the
loewestein
in
rosa
s
room
just
as
at
dort
he
had
watched
the
of
cornelius
he
had
not
been
installed
more
than
three
days
in
his
attic
before
all
his
doubts
were
removed
from
morning
to
sunset
the
was
in
the
window
and
like
those
charming
female
figures
of
mieris
and
metzys
rosa
appeared
at
that
window
as
in
a
frame
formed
by
the
first
budding
sprays
of
the
wild
vine
and
the
honeysuckle
encircling
her
window
rosa
watched
the
with
an
interest
which
betrayed
to
boxtel
the
real
value
of
the
object
enclosed
in
it
this
object
could
not
be
anything
else
but
the
second
bulb
that
is
to
say
the
quintessence
of
all
the
hopes
of
the
prisoner
when
the
nights
threatened
to
be
too
cold
rosa
took
in
the
well
it
was
then
quite
evident
she
was
following
the
instructions
of
cornelius
who
was
afraid
of
the
bulb
being
killed
by
frost
when
the
sun
became
too
hot
rosa
likewise
took
in
the
pot
from
eleven
in
the
morning
until
two
in
the
afternoon
another
proof
cornelius
was
afraid
lest
the
soil
should
become
too
dry
but
when
the
first
leaves
peeped
out
of
the
earth
boxtel
was
fully
convinced
and
his
telescope
left
him
no
longer
in
any
uncertainty
before
they
had
grown
one
inch
in
height
cornelius
possessed
two
bulbs
and
the
second
was
intrusted
to
the
love
and
care
of
rosa
for
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
the
tender
secret
of
the
two
lovers
had
not
escaped
the
prying
curiosity
of
boxtel
the
question
therefore
was
how
to
wrest
the
second
bulb
from
the
care
of
rosa
certainly
this
was
no
easy
task
rosa
watched
over
her
tulip
as
a
mother
over
her
child
or
a
dove
over
her
eggs
rosa
never
left
her
room
during
the
day
and
more
than
that
strange
to
say
she
never
left
it
in
the
evening
for
seven
days
boxtel
in
vain
watched
rosa
she
was
always
at
her
post
this
happened
during
those
seven
days
which
made
cornelius
so
unhappy
depriving
him
at
the
same
time
of
all
news
of
rosa
and
of
his
tulip
would
the
coolness
between
rosa
and
cornelius
last
for
ever
this
would
have
made
the
theft
much
more
difficult
than
mynheer
isaac
had
at
first
expected
we
say
the
theft
for
isaac
had
simply
made
up
his
mind
to
steal
the
tulip
and
as
it
grew
in
the
most
profound
secrecy
and
as
moreover
his
word
being
that
of
a
renowned
would
any
day
be
taken
against
that
of
an
unknown
girl
without
any
knowledge
of
horticulture
or
against
that
of
a
prisoner
convicted
of
high
treason
he
confidently
hoped
that
having
once
got
possession
of
the
bulb
he
would
be
certain
to
obtain
the
prize
and
then
the
tulip
instead
of
being
called
tulipa
nigra
barlœnsis
would
go
down
to
posterity
under
the
name
of
tulipa
nigra
boxtellensis
or
boxtellea
mynheer
isaac
had
not
yet
quite
decided
which
of
these
two
names
he
would
give
to
the
tulip
but
as
both
meant
the
same
thing
this
was
after
all
not
the
important
point
the
point
was
to
steal
the
tulip
but
in
order
that
boxtel
might
steal
the
tulip
it
was
necessary
that
rosa
should
leave
her
room
great
therefore
was
his
joy
when
he
saw
the
usual
evening
meetings
of
the
lovers
resumed
he
first
of
all
took
advantage
of
rosa
s
absence
to
make
himself
fully
acquainted
with
all
the
peculiarities
of
the
door
of
her
chamber
the
lock
was
a
double
one
and
in
good
order
but
rosa
always
took
the
key
with
her
boxtel
at
first
entertained
an
idea
of
stealing
the
key
but
it
soon
occurred
to
him
not
only
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
abstract
it
from
her
pocket
but
also
that
when
she
perceived
her
loss
she
would
not
leave
her
room
until
the
lock
was
changed
and
then
boxtel
s
first
theft
would
be
useless
he
thought
it
therefore
better
to
employ
a
different
expedient
he
collected
as
many
keys
as
he
could
and
tried
all
of
them
during
one
of
those
delightful
hours
which
rosa
and
cornelius
passed
together
at
the
grating
of
the
cell
two
of
the
keys
entered
the
lock
and
one
of
them
turned
round
once
but
not
the
second
time
there
was
therefore
only
a
little
to
be
done
to
this
key
boxtel
covered
it
with
a
slight
coat
of
wax
and
when
he
thus
renewed
the
experiment
the
obstacle
which
prevented
the
key
from
being
turned
a
second
time
left
its
impression
on
the
wax
it
cost
boxtel
two
days
more
to
bring
his
key
to
perfection
with
the
aid
of
a
small
file
rosa
s
door
thus
opened
without
noise
and
without
difficulty
and
boxtel
found
himself
in
her
room
alone
with
the
tulip
the
first
guilty
act
of
boxtel
had
been
to
climb
over
a
wall
in
order
to
dig
up
the
tulip
the
second
to
introduce
himself
into
the
of
cornelius
through
an
open
window
and
the
third
to
enter
rosa
s
room
by
means
of
a
false
key
thus
envy
urged
boxtel
on
with
rapid
steps
in
the
career
of
crime
boxtel
as
we
have
said
was
alone
with
the
tulip
a
common
thief
would
have
taken
the
pot
under
his
arm
and
carried
it
off
but
boxtel
was
not
a
common
thief
and
he
reflected
it
was
not
yet
certain
although
very
probable
that
the
tulip
would
flower
black
if
therefore
he
stole
it
now
he
not
only
might
be
committing
a
useless
crime
but
also
the
theft
might
be
discovered
in
the
time
which
must
elapse
until
the
flower
should
open
he
therefore
as
being
in
possession
of
the
key
he
might
enter
rosa
s
chamber
whenever
he
liked
thought
it
better
to
wait
and
to
take
it
either
an
hour
before
or
after
opening
and
to
start
on
the
instant
to
haarlem
where
the
tulip
would
be
before
the
judges
of
the
committee
before
any
one
else
could
put
in
a
reclamation
should
any
one
then
reclaim
it
boxtel
would
in
his
turn
charge
him
or
her
with
theft
this
was
a
scheme
and
quite
worthy
of
its
author
thus
every
evening
during
that
delightful
hour
which
the
two
lovers
passed
together
at
the
grated
window
boxtel
entered
rosa
s
chamber
to
watch
the
progress
which
the
black
tulip
had
made
towards
flowering
on
the
evening
at
which
we
have
arrived
he
was
going
to
enter
according
to
custom
but
the
two
lovers
as
we
have
seen
only
exchanged
a
few
words
before
cornelius
sent
rosa
back
to
watch
over
the
tulip
seeing
rosa
enter
her
room
ten
minutes
after
she
had
left
it
boxtel
guessed
that
the
tulip
had
opened
or
was
about
to
open
during
that
night
therefore
the
great
blow
was
to
be
struck
boxtel
presented
himself
before
gryphus
with
a
double
supply
of
genièvre
that
is
to
say
with
a
bottle
in
each
pocket
gryphus
being
once
fuddled
boxtel
was
very
nearly
master
of
the
house
at
eleven
o
clock
gryphus
was
dead
drunk
at
two
in
the
morning
boxtel
saw
rosa
leaving
the
chamber
but
evidently
she
held
in
her
arms
something
which
she
carried
with
great
care
he
did
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
black
tulip
which
was
in
flower
but
what
was
she
going
to
do
with
it
would
she
set
out
that
instant
to
haarlem
with
it
it
was
not
possible
that
a
young
girl
should
undertake
such
a
journey
alone
during
the
night
was
she
only
going
to
show
the
tulip
to
cornelius
this
was
more
likely
he
followed
rosa
in
his
stocking
feet
walking
on
tiptoe
he
saw
her
approach
the
grated
window
he
heard
her
calling
cornelius
by
the
light
of
the
dark
lantern
he
saw
the
tulip
open
and
black
as
the
night
in
which
he
was
hidden
he
heard
the
plan
concerted
between
cornelius
and
rosa
to
send
a
messenger
to
haarlem
he
saw
the
lips
of
the
lovers
meet
and
then
heard
cornelius
send
rosa
away
he
saw
rosa
extinguish
the
light
and
return
to
her
chamber
ten
minutes
after
he
saw
her
leave
the
room
again
and
lock
it
twice
boxtel
who
saw
all
this
whilst
hiding
himself
on
the
of
the
staircase
above
descended
step
by
step
from
his
story
as
rosa
descended
from
hers
so
that
when
she
touched
with
her
light
foot
the
lowest
step
of
the
staircase
boxtel
touched
with
a
still
lighter
hand
the
lock
of
rosa
s
chamber
and
in
that
hand
it
must
be
understood
he
held
the
false
key
which
opened
rosa
s
door
as
easily
as
did
the
real
one
and
this
is
why
in
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
we
said
that
the
poor
young
people
were
in
great
need
of
the
protection
of
god
chapter
the
black
tulip
changes
masters
cornelius
remained
standing
on
the
spot
where
rosa
had
left
him
he
was
quite
overpowered
with
the
weight
of
his
twofold
happiness
half
an
hour
passed
away
already
did
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
enter
through
the
iron
grating
of
the
prison
when
cornelius
was
suddenly
startled
at
the
noise
of
steps
which
came
up
the
staircase
and
of
cries
which
approached
nearer
and
nearer
almost
at
the
same
instant
he
saw
before
him
the
pale
and
distracted
face
of
rosa
he
started
and
turned
pale
with
fright
cornelius
cornelius
she
screamed
gasping
for
breath
good
heaven
what
is
it
asked
the
prisoner
cornelius
the
tulip
well
how
shall
i
tell
you
speak
speak
rosa
some
one
has
taken
stolen
it
from
stolen
taken
said
cornelius
yes
said
rosa
leaning
against
the
door
to
support
herself
yes
taken
stolen
and
saying
this
she
felt
her
limbs
failing
her
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
but
how
tell
me
explain
to
oh
it
is
not
my
fault
my
poor
rosa
she
no
longer
dared
to
call
him
my
beloved
you
have
then
left
it
alone
said
cornelius
ruefully
one
minute
only
to
instruct
our
messenger
who
lives
scarcely
fifty
yards
off
on
the
banks
of
the
and
during
that
time
notwithstanding
all
my
injunctions
you
left
the
key
behind
unfortunate
child
no
no
no
this
is
what
i
can
not
understand
the
key
was
never
out
of
my
hands
i
clinched
it
as
if
i
were
afraid
it
would
take
but
how
did
it
happen
then
that
s
what
i
can
not
make
out
i
had
given
the
letter
to
my
messenger
he
started
before
i
left
his
house
i
came
home
and
my
door
was
locked
everything
in
my
room
was
as
i
had
left
it
except
the
tulip
that
was
gone
some
one
must
have
had
a
key
for
my
room
or
have
got
a
false
one
made
on
she
was
nearly
choking
with
sobs
and
was
unable
to
continue
cornelius
immovable
and
full
of
consternation
heard
almost
without
understanding
and
only
muttered
stolen
stolen
and
i
am
lost
o
cornelius
forgive
me
forgive
me
it
will
kill
me
seeing
rosa
s
distress
cornelius
seized
the
iron
bars
of
the
grating
and
furiously
shaking
them
called
out
rosa
rosa
we
have
been
robbed
it
is
true
but
shall
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
dejected
for
all
that
no
no
the
misfortune
is
great
but
it
may
perhaps
be
remedied
rosa
we
know
the
thief
alas
what
can
i
say
about
it
but
i
say
that
it
is
no
one
else
but
that
infamous
jacob
shall
we
allow
him
to
carry
to
haarlem
the
fruit
of
our
labour
the
fruit
of
our
sleepless
nights
the
child
of
our
love
rosa
we
must
pursue
we
must
overtake
him
but
how
can
we
do
all
this
my
friend
without
letting
my
father
know
we
were
in
communication
with
each
other
how
should
i
a
poor
girl
with
so
little
knowledge
of
the
world
and
its
ways
be
able
to
attain
this
end
which
perhaps
you
could
not
attain
yourself
rosa
rosa
open
this
door
to

and
you
will

and
the
unfortunate
man
whose
strength
was
increased
tenfold
by
his
rage
began
to
shake
the
door
with
a
great
noise
little
heeding
that
the
thunder
of
his
voice
was
through
the
spiral
staircase
rosa
in
her
fright
made
vain
attempts
to
check
this
furious
outbreak

did
not
finish
her
speech
as
a
growl
by
her
side
interrupted
her
my
father
cried
rosa
gryphus
roared
van
baerle
oh
you
villain
old
gryphus
in
the
midst
of
all
the
noise
had
ascended
the
staircase
without
being
heard
he
rudely
seized
his
daughter
by
the
wrist
so
you
will
take
my
keys
he
said
in
a
voice
choked
with
rage
ah
this
dastardly
fellow
this
monster
this
of
a
conspirator
is
your
own
dear

t
i
rosa
clasped
her
hands
in
despair
ah
gryphus
continued
passing
from
the
madness
of
anger
to
the
cool
irony
of
a
man
who
has
got
the
better
of
his
enemy
ah
you
innocent
you
gentle
scholar
you
will
kill
me
and

well

day
after

felicity

unnatural

as
to
you
master

we
shall
see
each
other
again
just
be
quiet
we
rosa
beyond
herself
with
terror
and
despair
kissed
her
hands
to
her
friend
then
suddenly
struck
with
a
bright
thought
she
rushed
toward
the
staircase
saying
all
is
not
yet
lost
cornelius
rely
on
me
my
her
father
followed
her
growling
as
to
poor
cornelius
he
gradually
loosened
his
hold
of
the
bars
which
his
fingers
still
grasped
convulsively
his
head
was
heavy
his
eyes
almost
started
from
their
sockets
and
he
fell
heavily
on
the
floor
of
his
cell
muttering
stolen
it
has
been
stolen
from
me
during
this
time
boxtel
had
left
the
fortress
by
the
door
which
rosa
herself
had
opened
he
carried
the
black
tulip
wrapped
up
in
a
cloak
and
throwing
himself
into
a
coach
which
was
waiting
for
him
at
gorcum
he
drove
off
without
as
may
well
be
imagined
having
informed
his
friend
gryphus
of
his
sudden
departure
and
now
as
we
have
seen
him
enter
his
coach
we
shall
with
the
consent
of
the
reader
follow
him
to
the
end
of
his
journey
he
proceeded
but
slowly
as
the
black
tulip
could
not
bear
travelling
but
boxtel
fearing
that
he
might
not
arrive
early
enough
procured
at
delft
a
box
lined
all
round
with
fresh
moss
in
which
he
packed
the
tulip
the
flower
was
so
lightly
pressed
upon
all
sides
with
a
supply
of
air
from
above
that
the
coach
could
now
travel
full
speed
without
any
possibility
of
injury
to
the
tulip
he
arrived
next
morning
at
haarlem
fatigued
but
triumphant
and
to
do
away
with
every
trace
of
the
theft
he
transplanted
the
tulip
and
breaking
the
original
threw
the
pieces
into
the
canal
after
which
he
wrote
the
president
of
the
horticultural
society
a
letter
in
which
he
announced
to
him
that
he
had
just
arrived
at
haarlem
with
a
perfectly
black
tulip
and
with
his
flower
all
safe
took
up
his
quarters
at
a
good
hotel
in
the
town
and
there
he
waited
chapter
the
president
van
systens
rosa
on
leaving
cornelius
had
fixed
on
her
plan
which
was
no
other
than
to
restore
to
cornelius
the
stolen
tulip
or
never
to
see
him
again
she
had
seen
the
despair
of
the
prisoner
and
she
knew
that
it
was
derived
from
a
double
source
and
that
it
was
incurable
on
the
one
hand
separation
became
inevitable
gryphus
having
at
the
same
time
surprised
the
secret
of
their
love
and
of
their
secret
meetings
on
the
other
hand
all
the
hopes
on
the
fulfilment
of
which
cornelius
van
baerle
had
rested
his
ambition
for
the
last
seven
years
were
now
crushed
rosa
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
dejected
by
trifles
but
who
in
great
emergencies
are
supplied
by
the
misfortune
itself
with
the
energy
for
combating
or
with
the
resources
for
remedying
it
she
went
to
her
room
and
cast
a
last
glance
about
her
to
see
whether
she
had
not
been
mistaken
and
whether
the
tulip
was
not
stowed
away
in
some
corner
where
it
had
escaped
her
notice
but
she
sought
in
vain
the
tulip
was
still
missing
the
tulip
was
indeed
stolen
rosa
made
up
a
little
parcel
of
things
indispensable
for
a
journey
took
her
three
hundred
guilders
that
is
to
say
all
her
fortune
fetched
the
third
bulb
from
among
her
lace
where
she
had
laid
it
up
and
carefully
hid
it
in
her
bosom
after
which
she
locked
her
door
twice
to
disguise
her
flight
as
long
as
possible
and
leaving
the
prison
by
the
same
door
which
an
hour
before
had
let
out
boxtel
she
went
to
a
to
hire
a
carriage
the
man
had
only
a
chaise
and
this
was
the
vehicle
which
boxtel
had
hired
since
last
evening
and
in
which
he
was
now
driving
along
the
road
to
delft
for
the
road
from
loewestein
to
haarlem
owing
to
the
many
canals
rivers
and
rivulets
intersecting
the
country
is
exceedingly
circuitous
not
being
able
to
procure
a
vehicle
rosa
was
obliged
to
take
a
horse
with
which
the
readily
intrusted
her
knowing
her
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
jailer
of
the
fortress
rosa
hoped
to
overtake
her
messenger
a
and
honest
lad
whom
she
would
take
with
her
and
who
might
at
the
same
time
serve
her
as
a
guide
and
a
protector
and
in
fact
she
had
not
proceeded
more
than
a
league
before
she
saw
him
hastening
along
one
of
the
side
paths
of
a
very
pretty
road
by
the
river
setting
her
horse
off
at
a
canter
she
soon
came
up
with
him
the
honest
lad
was
not
aware
of
the
important
character
of
his
message
nevertheless
he
used
as
much
speed
as
if
he
had
known
it
and
in
less
than
an
hour
he
had
already
gone
a
league
and
a
half
rosa
took
from
him
the
note
which
had
now
become
useless
and
explained
to
him
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
for
her
the
boatman
placed
himself
entirely
at
her
disposal
promising
to
keep
pace
with
the
horse
if
rosa
would
allow
him
to
take
hold
of
either
the
croup
or
the
bridle
of
her
horse
the
two
travellers
had
been
on
their
way
for
five
hours
and
made
more
than
eight
leagues
and
yet
gryphus
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
his
daughter
having
left
the
fortress
the
jailer
who
was
of
a
very
spiteful
and
cruel
disposition
chuckled
within
himself
at
the
idea
of
having
struck
such
terror
into
his
daughter
s
heart
but
whilst
he
was
congratulating
himself
on
having
such
a
nice
story
to
tell
to
his
boon
companion
jacob
that
worthy
was
on
his
road
to
delft
and
thanks
to
the
swiftness
of
the
horse
had
already
the
start
of
rosa
and
her
companion
by
four
leagues
and
whilst
the
affectionate
father
was
rejoicing
at
the
thought
of
his
daughter
weeping
in
her
room
rosa
was
making
the
best
of
her
way
towards
haarlem
thus
the
prisoner
alone
was
where
gryphus
thought
him
to
be
rosa
was
so
little
with
her
father
since
she
took
care
of
the
tulip
that
at
his
dinner
hour
that
is
to
say
at
twelve
o
clock
he
was
reminded
for
the
first
time
by
his
appetite
that
his
daughter
was
fretting
rather
too
long
he
sent
one
of
the
to
call
her
and
when
the
man
came
back
to
tell
him
that
he
had
called
and
sought
her
in
vain
he
resolved
to
go
and
call
her
himself
he
first
went
to
her
room
but
loud
as
he
knocked
rosa
answered
not
the
locksmith
of
the
fortress
was
sent
for
he
opened
the
door
but
gryphus
no
more
found
rosa
than
she
had
found
the
tulip
at
that
very
moment
she
entered
rotterdam
gryphus
therefore
had
just
as
little
chance
of
finding
her
in
the
kitchen
as
in
her
room
and
just
as
little
in
the
garden
as
in
the
kitchen
the
reader
may
imagine
the
anger
of
the
jailer
when
after
having
made
inquiries
about
the
neighbourhood
he
heard
that
his
daughter
had
hired
a
horse
and
like
an
adventuress
set
out
on
a
journey
without
saying
where
she
was
going
gryphus
again
went
up
in
his
fury
to
van
baerle
abused
him
threatened
him
knocked
all
the
miserable
furniture
of
his
cell
about
and
promised
him
all
sorts
of
misery
even
starvation
and
flogging
cornelius
without
even
hearing
what
his
jailer
said
allowed
himself
to
be
abused
and
threatened
remaining
all
the
while
sullen
immovable
dead
to
every
emotion
and
fear
after
having
sought
for
rosa
in
every
direction
gryphus
looked
out
for
jacob
and
as
he
could
not
find
him
either
he
began
to
suspect
from
that
moment
that
jacob
had
run
away
with
her
the
damsel
meanwhile
after
having
stopped
for
two
hours
at
rotterdam
had
started
again
on
her
journey
on
that
evening
she
slept
at
delft
and
on
the
following
morning
she
reached
haarlem
four
hours
after
boxtel
had
arrived
there
rosa
first
of
all
caused
herself
to
be
led
before
mynheer
van
systens
the
president
of
the
horticultural
society
of
haarlem
she
found
that
worthy
gentleman
in
a
situation
which
to
do
justice
to
our
story
we
must
not
pass
over
in
our
description
the
president
was
drawing
up
a
report
to
the
committee
of
the
society
this
report
was
written
on
paper
in
the
finest
handwriting
of
the
president
rosa
was
announced
simply
as
rosa
gryphus
but
as
her
name
well
as
it
might
sound
was
unknown
to
the
president
she
was
refused
admittance
rosa
however
was
by
no
means
abashed
having
vowed
in
her
heart
in
pursuing
her
cause
not
to
allow
herself
to
be
put
down
either
by
refusal
or
abuse
or
even
brutality
announce
to
the
president
she
said
to
the
servant
that
i
want
to
speak
to
him
about
the
black
these
words
seemed
to
be
an
open
sesame
for
she
soon
found
herself
in
the
office
of
the
president
van
systens
who
gallantly
rose
from
his
chair
to
meet
her
he
was
a
spare
little
man
resembling
the
stem
of
a
flower
his
head
forming
its
chalice
and
his
two
limp
arms
representing
the
double
leaf
of
the
tulip
the
resemblance
was
rendered
complete
by
his
waddling
gait
which
made
him
even
more
like
that
flower
when
it
bends
under
a
breeze
well
miss
he
said
you
are
coming
i
am
told
about
the
affair
of
the
black
to
the
president
of
the
horticultural
society
the
tulipa
nigra
was
a
power
which
in
its
character
as
queen
of
the
tulips
might
send

asked
van
systens

a
smile
of
tender
veneration

don
t

rosa
how
is
that
could
any
misfortune

happened

a
very
great
one

but
to
what
it
has
been
stolen
from
stolen
the
black
tulip
yes
do
you
know
the
thief
i
have
my
suspicions
but
i
must
not
yet
accuse
any
but
the
matter
may
very
easily
be
how
is
that
as
it
has
been
stolen
from
you
the
thief
can
not
be
far
why
not
because
i
have
seen
the
black
tulip
only
two
hours
you
have
seen
the
black
tulip
cried
rosa
rushing
up
to
mynheer

systens
as

your
master
of
with
my
master
yes
are
you
not
in
the
service
of
master
isaac
boxtel
i
yes
but
for
whom
do
you
take
me
sir
and
for
whom
do
you
take
me
i
hope
sir
i
take
you
for
what
you
are
that
is
to
say
for
the
honorable
mynheer
van
systens
burgomaster
of
haarlem
and
president
of
the
horticultural
and
what
is
it
you
told
me
just
now
i
told
you
sir
that
my
tulip
has
been
then
your
tulip
is
that
of
mynheer
boxtel
well
my
child
you
express
yourself
very
badly
the
tulip
has
been
stolen
not
from
you
but
from
mynheer
i
repeat
to
you
sir
that
i
do
not
know
who
this
mynheer
boxtel
is
and
that
i
have
now
heard
his
name
pronounced
for
the
first
you
do
not
know
who
mynheer
boxtel
is
and
you
also
had
a
black
tulip
but
is
there
any
other
besides
mine
asked
rosa
trembling
yes
that
of
mynheer
how
is
it
black
of
without
speck
without
a
single
speck
or
even
and
you
have
this
tulip
you
have
it
deposited
here
no
but
it
will
be
as
it
has
to
be
exhibited
before
the
committee
previous
to
the
prize
being
oh
sir
cried
rosa
this
boxtel
this
isaac
boxtel
who
calls
himself
the
owner
of
the
black
tulip
and
who
is
its
owner
is
he
not
a
very
thin
man
bald
with
sunken
eyes
i
think
he
restless
stooping
and
bowlegged
in
truth
you
draw
master
boxtel
s
portrait
feature
by
and
the
tulip
sir
is
it
not
in
a
pot
of
white
and
blue
earthenware
with
yellowish
flowers
in
a
basket
on
three
sides
oh
as
to
that
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
looked
more
at
the
flower
than
at
the
oh
sir
that
s
my
tulip
which
has
been
stolen
from
me
i
came
here
to
reclaim
it
before
you
and
from
oh
oh
said
van
systens
looking
at
rosa
what
you
are
here
to
claim
the
tulip
of
master
boxtel
well
i
must
say
you
are
cool
honoured
sir
a
little
put
out
by
this
apostrophe
i
do
not
say
that
i
am
coming
to
claim
the
tulip
of
master
boxtel
but
to
reclaim
my
yours
yes
the
one
which
i
have
myself
planted
and
well
then
go
and
find
out
master
boxtel
at
the
white
swan
inn
and
you
can
then
settle
matters
with
him
as
for
me
considering
that
the
cause
seems
to
me
as
difficult
to
judge
as
that
which
was
brought
before
king
solomon
and
that
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
as
wise
as
he
was
i
shall
content
myself
with
making
my
report
establishing
the
existence
of
the
black
tulip
and
ordering
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
to
be
paid
to
its
grower
my
oh
sir
sir
said
rosa
imploringly
only
my
child
continued
van
systens
as
you
are
young
and
pretty
and
as
there
may
be
still
some
good
in
you
i
ll
give
you
some
good
advice
be
prudent
in
this
matter
for
we
have
a
court
of
justice
and
a
prison
here
at
haarlem
and
moreover
we
are
exceedingly
ticklish
as
far
as
the
honour
of
our
tulips
is
concerned
go
my
child
go
remember
master
isaac
boxtel
at
the
white
swan
and
mynheer
van
systens
taking
up
his
fine
pen
resumed
his
report
which
had
been
interrupted
by
rosa
s
visit
chapter
a
member
of
the
horticultural
society
rosa
beyond
herself
and
nearly
mad
with
joy
and
fear
at
the
idea
of
the
black
tulip
being
found
again
started
for
the
white
swan
followed
by
the
boatman
a
stout
lad
from
frisia
who
was
strong
enough
to
knock
down
a
dozen
boxtels
he
had
been
made
acquainted
in
the
course
of
the
journey
with
the
state
of
affairs
and
was
not
afraid
of
any
encounter
only
he
had
orders
in
such
a
case
to
spare
the
tulip
but
on
arriving
in
the
great
rosa
at
once
stopped
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
her
just
as
homer
s
minerva
seizes
achilles
by
the
hair
at
the
moment
when
he
is
about
to
be
carried
away
by
his
anger
good
heaven
she
muttered
to
herself
i
have
made
a
grievous
blunder
it
may
be
i
have
ruined
cornelius
the
tulip
and
myself
i
have
given
the
alarm
and
perhaps
awakened
suspicion
i
am
but
a
woman
these
men
may
league
themselves
against
me
and
then
i
shall
be
lost
if
i
am
lost
that
matters
nothing
but
cornelius
and
the
tulip
she
reflected
for
a
moment
if
i
go
to
that
boxtel
and
do
not
know
him
if
that
boxtel
is
not
my
jacob
but
another
fancier
who
has
also
discovered
the
black
tulip
or
if
my
tulip
has
been
stolen
by
some
one
else
or
has
already
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
third
person
if
i
do
not
recognize
the
man
only
the
tulip
how
shall
i
prove
that
it
belongs
to
me
on
the
other
hand
if
i
recognise
this
boxtel
as
jacob
who
knows
what
will
come
out
of
it
whilst
we
are
contesting
with
each
other
the
tulip
will
in
the
meanwhile
a
great
noise
was
heard
like
the
distant
roar
of
the
sea
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
people
were
running
about
doors
opening
and
shutting
rosa
alone
was
unconscious
of
all
this
hubbub
among
the
multitude
we
must
return
to
the
president
she
muttered
well
then
let
us
return
said
the
boatman
they
took
a
small
street
which
led
them
straight
to
the
mansion
of
mynheer
van
systens
who
with
his
best
pen
in
his
finest
hand
continued
to
draw
up
his
report
everywhere
on
her
way
rosa
heard
people
speaking
only
of
the
black
tulip
and
the
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
the
news
had
spread
like
wildfire
through
the
town
rosa
had
not
a
little
difficulty
is
penetrating
a
second
time
into
the
office
of
mynheer
van
systens
who
however
was
again
moved
by
the
magic
name
of
the
black
tulip
but
when
he
recognised
rosa
whom
in
his
own
mind
he
had
set
down
as
mad
or
even
worse
he
grew
angry
and
wanted
to
send
her
away
rosa
however
clasped
her
hands
and
said
with
that
tone
of
honest
truth
which
generally
finds
its
way
to
the
hearts
of
men
for
heaven
s
sake
sir
do
not
turn
me
away
listen
to
what
i
have
to
tell
you
and
if
it
be
not
possible
for
you
to
do
me
justice
at
least
you
will
not
one
day
have
to
reproach
yourself
before
god
for
having
made
yourself
the
accomplice
of
a
bad
van
systens
stamped
his
foot
with
impatience
it
was
the
second
time
that
rosa
interrupted
him
in
the
midst
of
a
composition
which
stimulated
his
vanity
both
as
a
burgomaster
and
as
president
of
the
horticultural
society
but
my
report
he
cried
my
report
on
the
black
tulip
mynheer
van
systens
rosa
continued
with
the
firmness
of
innocence
and
truth
your
report
on
the
black
tulip
will
if
you
don
t
hear
me
be
based
on
crime
or
on
falsehood
i
implore
you
sir
let
this
master
boxtel
whom
i
assert
to
be
master
jacob
be
brought
here
before
you
and
me
and
i
swear
that
i
will
leave
him
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
tulip
if
i
do
not
recognise
the
flower
and
its
well
i
declare
here
is
a
proposal
said
van
systens
what
do
you
mean
i
ask
you
what
can
be
proved
by
your
recognising
them
after
all
said
rosa
in
her
despair
you
are
an
honest
man
sir
how
would
you
feel
if
one
day
you
found
out
that
you
had
given
the
prize
to
a
man
for
something
which
he
not
only
had
not
produced
but
which
he
had
even
stolen
rosa
s
speech
seemed
to
have
brought
a
certain
conviction
into
the
heart
of
van
systens
and
he
was
going
to
answer
her
in
a
gentler
tone
when
at
once
a
great
noise
was
heard
in
the
street
and
loud
cheers
shook
the
house
what
is
this
cried
the
burgomaster
what
is
this
is
it
possible
have
i
heard
aright
and
he
rushed
towards
his
anteroom
without
any
longer
heeding
rosa
whom
he
left
in
his
cabinet
scarcely
had
he
reached
his
anteroom
when
he
cried
out
aloud
on
seeing
his
staircase
invaded
up
to
the
very
by
the
multitude
which
was
accompanying
or
rather
following
a
young
man
simply
clad
in
a
velvet
embroidered
with
silver
who
with
a
certain
aristocratic
slowness
ascended
the
white
stone
steps
of
the
house
in
his
wake
followed
two
officers
one
of
the
navy
and
the
other
of
the
cavalry
van
systens
having
found
his
way
through
the
frightened
domestics
began
to
bow
almost
to
prostrate
himself
before
his
visitor
who
had
been
the
cause
of
all
this
stir
monseigneur
he
called
out
monseigneur
what
distinguished
honour
is
your
highness
bestowing
for
ever
on
my
humble
house
by
your
visit
dear
mynheer
van
systens
said
william
of
orange
with
a
serenity
which
with
him
took
the
place
of
a
smile
i
am
a
true
hollander
i
am
fond
of
the
water
of
beer
and
of
flowers
sometimes
even
of
that
cheese
the
flavour
of
which
seems
so
grateful
to
the
french
the
flower
which
i
prefer
to
all
others
is
of
course
the
tulip
i
heard
at
leyden
that
the
city
of
haarlem
at
last
possessed
the
black
tulip
and
after
having
satisfied
myself
of
the
truth
of
news
which
seemed
so
incredible
i
have
come
to
know
all
about
it
from
the
president
of
the
horticultural
oh
monseigneur
monseigneur
said
van
systens
what
glory
to
the
society
if
its
endeavours
are
pleasing
to
your
highness
have
you
got
the
flower
here
said
the
prince
who
very
likely
already
regretted
having
made
such
a
long
speech
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
have
and
where
is
it
with
its
who
is
he
an
honest
of
his
name
his
quarters
at
the
white
swan
i
shall
send
for
him
and
if
in
the
meanwhile
your
highness
will
do
me
the
honour
of
stepping
into
my
he
will
be
sure
knowing
that
your
highness
is
here
to
lose
no
time
in
bringing
his
very
well
send
for
yes
your
highness
but
what
is
it
oh
nothing
of
any
consequence
everything
is
of
consequence
mynheer
van
well
then
monseigneur
if
it
must
be
said
a
little
difficulty
has
presented
what
difficulty
this
tulip
has
already
been
claimed
by
usurpers
it
s
true
that
it
is
worth
a
hundred
thousand
indeed
yes
monseigneur
by
usurpers
by
this
is
a
crime
mynheer
van
so
it
is
your
and
have
you
any
proofs
of
their
guilt
no
monseigneur
the
guilty
woman
the
guilty
woman
sir
i
ought
to
say
the
woman
who
claims
the
tulip
monseigneur
is
here
in
the
room
close
and
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
think
monseigneur
that
the
bait
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
may
have
tempted
and
so
she
claims
the
tulip
yes
and
what
proof
does
she
offer
i
was
just
going
to
question
her
when
your
highness
came
question
her
mynheer
van
systens
question
her
i
am
the
first
magistrate
of
the
country
i
will
hear
the
case
and
administer
i
have
found
my
king
solomon
said
van
systens
bowing
and
showing
the
way
to
the
prince
his
highness
was
just
going
to
walk
ahead
but
suddenly
recollecting
himself
he
said
go
before
me
and
call
me
plain
the
two
then
entered
the
cabinet
rosa
was
still
standing
at
the
same
place
leaning
on
the
window
and
looking
through
the
panes
into
the
garden
ah
a
frisian
girl
said
the
prince
as
he
observed
rosa
s
gold
brocade
headdress
and
red
petticoat
at
the
noise
of
their
footsteps
she
turned
round
but
scarcely
saw
the
prince
who
seated
himself
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
apartment
all
her
attention
as
may
be
easily
imagined
was
fixed
on
that
important
person
who
was
called
van
systens
so
that
she
had
no
time
to
notice
the
humble
stranger
who
was
following
the
master
of
the
house
and
who
for
aught
she
knew
might
be
somebody
or
nobody
the
humble
stranger
took
a
book
down
from
the
shelf
and
made
van
systens
a
sign
to
commence
the
examination
forthwith
van
systens
likewise
at
the
invitation
of
the
young
man
in
the
violet
coat
sat
down
in
his
turn
and
quite
happy
and
proud
of
the
importance
thus
cast
upon
him
began
my
child
you
promise
to
tell
me
the
truth
and
the
entire
truth
concerning
this
tulip
i
well
then
speak
before
this
gentleman
this
gentleman
is
one
of
the
members
of
the
horticultural
what
am
i
to
tell
you
sir
said
rosa
beside
that
which
i
have
told
you
well
then
what
is
it
i
repeat
the
question
i
have
addressed
to
you
which
that
you
will
order
mynheer
boxtel
to
come
here
with
his
tulip
if
i
do
not
recognise
it
as
mine
i
will
frankly
tell
it
but
if
i
do
recognise
it
i
will
reclaim
it
even
if
i
go
before
his
highness
the
stadtholder
himself
with
my
proofs
in
my
you
have
then
some
proofs
my
child
god
who
knows
my
good
right
will
assist
me
to
van
systens
exchanged
a
look
with
the
prince
who
since
the
first
words
of
rosa
seemed
to
try
to
remember
her
as
if
it
were
not
for
the
first
time
that
this
sweet
voice
rang
in
his
ears
an
officer
went
off
to
fetch
boxtel
and
van
systens
in
the
meanwhile
continued
his
examination
and
with
what
do
you
support
your
assertion
that
you
are
the
real
owner
of
the
black
tulip
with
the
very
simple
fact
of
my
having
planted
and
grown
it
in
my
own
in
your
chamber
where
was
your
chamber
at
you
are
from
loewestein
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
jailer
of
the
the
prince
made
a
little
movement
as
much
as
to
say
well
that
s
it
i
remember
and
all
the
while
feigning
to
be
engaged
with
his
book
he
watched
rosa
with
even
more
attention
than
he
had
before
and
you
are
fond
of
flowers
continued
mynheer
van
systens
yes
then
you
are
an
experienced
florist
i
dare
say
rosa
hesitated
a
moment
then
with
a
tone
which
came
from
the
depth
of
her
heart
she
said
gentlemen
i
am
speaking
to
men
of
there
was
such
an
expression
of
truth
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
van
systens
and
the
prince
answered
simultaneously
by
an
affirmative
movement
of
their
heads
well
then
i
am
not
an
experienced
florist
i
am
only
a
poor
girl
one
of
the
people
who
three
months
ago
knew
neither
how
to
read
nor
how
to
write
no
the
black
tulip
has
not
been
found
by
but
by
whom
else
by
a
poor
prisoner
of
by
a
prisoner
of
loewestein
repeated
the
prince
the
tone
of
his
voice
startled
rosa
who
was
sure
she
had
heard
it
before
by
a
prisoner
of
state
then
continued
the
prince
as
there
are
none
else
having
said
this
he
began
to
read
again
at
least
in
appearance
yes
said
rosa
with
a
faltering
voice
yes
by
a
prisoner
of
van
systens
trembled
as
he
heard
such
a
confession
made
in
the
presence
of
such
a
witness
continue
said
william
dryly
to
the
president
of
the
horticultural
society
ah
sir
said
rosa
addressing
the
person
whom
she
thought
to
be
her
real
judge
i
am
going
to
incriminate
myself
very
certainly
said
van
systens
the
prisoner
of
state
ought
to
be
kept
in
close
confinement
at
alas
and
from
what
you
tell
me
you
took
advantage
of
your
position
as
daughter
of
the
jailer
to
communicate
with
a
prisoner
of
state
about
the
cultivation
of
so
it
is
sir
rosa
murmured
in
dismay
yes
i
am
bound
to
confess
i
saw
him
every
unfortunate
girl
exclaimed
van
systens
the
prince
observing
the
fright
of
rosa
and
the
pallor
of
the
president
raised
his
head
and
said
in
his
clear
and
decided
tone
this
can
not
signify
anything
to
the
members
of
the
horticultural
society
they
have
to
judge
on
the
black
tulip
and
have
no
cognizance
to
take
of
political
offences
go
on
young
woman
go
van
systens
by
means
of
an
eloquent
glance
offered
in
the
name
of
the
tulip
his
thanks
to
the
new
member
of
the
horticultural
society
rosa
reassured
by
this
sort
of
encouragement
which
the
stranger
was
giving
her
related
all
that
had
happened
for
the
last
three
months
all
that
she
had
done
and
all
that
she
had
suffered
she
described
the
cruelty
of
gryphus
the
destruction
of
the
first
bulb
the
grief
of
the
prisoner
the
precautions
taken
to
insure
the
success
of
the
second
bulb
the
patience
of
the
prisoner
and
his
anxiety
during
their
separation
how
he
was
about
to
starve
himself
because
he
had
no
longer
any
news
of
his
tulip
his
joy
when
she
went
to
see
him
again
and
lastly
their
despair
when
they
found
that
the
tulip
which
had
come
into
flower
was
stolen
just
one
hour
after
it
had
opened
all
this
was
detailed
with
an
accent
of
truth
which
although
producing
no
change
in
the
impassible
mien
of
the
prince
did
not
fail
to
take
effect
on
van
systens
but
said
the
prince
it
can
not
be
long
since
you
knew
the
rosa
opened
her
large
eyes
and
looked
at
the
stranger
who
drew
back
into
the
dark
corner
as
if
he
wished
to
escape
her
observation
why
sir
she
asked
him
because
it
is
not
yet
four
months
since
the
jailer
gryphus
and
his
daughter
were
removed
to
that
is
true
otherwise
you
must
have
solicited
the
transfer
of
your
father
in
order
to
be
able
to
follow
some
prisoner
who
may
have
been
transported
from
the
hague
to
sir
said
rosa
blushing
finish
what
you
have
to
say
said
william
i
confess
i
knew
the
prisoner
at
the
happy
prisoner
said
william
smiling
at
this
moment
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
for
boxtel
returned
and
announced
to
the
prince
that
the
person
whom
he
had
been
to
fetch
was
following
on
his
heels
with
his
tulip
chapter
the
third
bulb
boxtel
s
return
was
scarcely
announced
when
he
entered
in
person
the
of
mynheer
van
systens
followed
by
two
men
who
carried
in
a
box
their
precious
burden
and
deposited
it
on
a
table
the
prince
on
being
informed
left
the
cabinet
passed
into
the
admired
the
flower
and
silently
resumed
his
seat
in
the
dark
corner
where
he
had
himself
placed
his
chair
rosa
trembling
pale
and
terrified
expected
to
be
invited
in
her
turn
to
see
the
tulip
she
now
heard
the
voice
of
boxtel
it
is
he
she
exclaimed
the
prince
made
her
a
sign
to
go
and
look
through
the
open
door
into
the
it
is
my
tulip
cried
rosa
i
recognise
it
oh
my
poor
cornelius
and
saying
this
she
burst
into
tears
the
prince
rose
from
his
seat
went
to
the
door
where
he
stood
for
some
time
with
the
full
light
falling
upon
his
figure
as
rosa
s
eyes
now
rested
upon
him
she
felt
more
than
ever
convinced
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
seen
the
stranger
master
boxtel
said
the
prince
come
in
here
if
you
boxtel
eagerly
approached
and
finding
himself
face
to
face
with
william
of
orange
started
back
his
highness
he
called
out
his
highness
rosa
repeated
in
dismay
hearing
this
exclamation
on
his
left
boxtel
turned
round
and
perceived
rosa
at
this
sight
the
whole
frame
of
the
thief
shook
as
if
under
the
influence
of
a
galvanic
shock
ah
muttered
the
prince
to
himself
he
is
but
boxtel
making
a
violent
effort
to
control
his
feelings
was
already
himself
again
master
boxtel
said
william
you
seem
to
have
discovered
the
secret
of
growing
the
black
tulip
yes
your
highness
answered
boxtel
in
a
voice
which
still
betrayed
some
confusion
it
is
true
his
agitation
might
have
been
attributable
to
the
emotion
which
the
man
must
have
felt
on
suddenly
recognising
the
prince
but
continued
the
stadtholder
here
is
a
young
damsel
who
also
pretends
to
have
found
boxtel
with
a
disdainful
smile
shrugged
his
shoulders
william
watched
all
his
movements
with
evident
interest
and
curiosity
then
you
don
t
know
this
young
girl
said
the
prince
no
your
highness
and
you
child
do
you
know
master
boxtel
no
i
don
t
know
master
boxtel
but
i
know
master
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
to
say
that
at
loewestein
the
man
who
here
calls
himself
isaac
boxtel
went
by
the
name
of
master
what
do
you
say
to
that
master
boxtel
i
say
that
this
damsel
lies
your
you
deny
therefore
having
ever
been
at
loewestein
boxtel
hesitated
the
fixed
and
searching
glance
of
the
proud
eye
of
the
prince
prevented
him
from
lying
i
can
not
deny
having
been
at
loewestein
your
highness
but
i
deny
having
stolen
the
you
have
stolen
it
and
that
from
my
room
cried
rosa
with
indignation
i
deny
now
listen
to
me
do
you
deny
having
followed
me
into
the
garden
on
the
day
when
i
prepared
the
border
where
i
was
to
plant
it
do
you
deny
having
followed
me
into
the
garden
when
i
pretended
to
plant
it
do
you
deny
that
on
that
evening
you
rushed
after
my
departure
to
the
spot
where
you
hoped
to
find
the
bulb
do
you
deny
having
dug
in
the
ground
with
your
hands
but
thank
god
in
vain
as
it
was
a
stratagem
to
discover
your
intentions
say
do
you
deny
all
this
boxtel
did
not
deem
it
fit
to
answer
these
several
charges
but
turning
to
the
prince
continued
i
have
now
for
twenty
years
grown
tulips
at
dort
i
have
even
acquired
some
reputation
in
this
art
one
of
my
hybrids
is
entered
in
the
catalogue
under
the
name
of
an
illustrious
personage
i
have
dedicated
it
to
the
king
of
portugal
the
truth
in
the
matter
is
as
i
shall
now
tell
your
highness
this
damsel
knew
that
i
had
produced
the
black
tulip
and
in
concert
with
a
lover
of
hers
in
the
fortress
of
loewestein
she
formed
the
plan
of
ruining
me
by
appropriating
to
herself
the
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
which
with
the
help
of
your
highness
s
justice
i
hope
to
yah
cried
rosa
beyond
herself
with
anger
silence
said
the
prince
then
turning
to
boxtel
he
said
and
who
is
that
prisoner
to
whom
you
allude
as
the
lover
of
this
young
woman
rosa
nearly
swooned
for
cornelius
was
designated
as
a
dangerous
prisoner
and
recommended
by
the
prince
to
the
especial
surveillance
of
the
jailer
nothing
could
have
been
more
agreeable
to
boxtel
than
this
question
this
prisoner
he
said
is
a
man
whose
name
in
itself
will
prove
to
your
highness
what
trust
you
may
place
in
his
probity
he
is
a
prisoner
of
state
who
was
once
condemned
to
and
his
name
rosa
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
with
a
movement
of
despair
his
name
is
cornelius
van
baerle
said
boxtel
and
he
is
godson
of
that
villain
cornelius
de
the
prince
gave
a
start
his
generally
quiet
eye
flashed
and
a
paleness
spread
over
his
impassible
features
he
went
up
to
rosa
and
with
his
finger
gave
her
a
sign
to
remove
her
hands
from
her
face
rosa
obeyed
as
if
under
mesmeric
influence
without
having
seen
the
sign
it
was
then
to
follow
this
man
that
you
came
to
me
at
leyden
to
solicit
for
the
transfer
of
your
father
rosa
hung
down
her
head
and
nearly
choking
said
yes
your
go
on
said
the
prince
to
boxtel
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
isaac
continued
your
highness
knows
all
but
there
is
one
thing
which
i
did
not
intend
to
say
because
i
did
not
wish
to
make
this
girl
blush
for
her
ingratitude
i
came
to
loewestein
because
i
had
business
there
on
this
occasion
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
old
gryphus
and
falling
in
love
with
his
daughter
made
an
offer
of
marriage
to
her
and
not
being
rich
i
committed
the
imprudence
of
mentioning
to
them
my
prospect
of
gaining
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
in
proof
of
which
i
showed
to
them
the
black
tulip
her
lover
having
himself
made
a
show
at
dort
of
cultivating
tulips
to
hide
his
political
intrigues
they
now
plotted
together
for
my
ruin
on
the
eve
of
the
day
when
the
flower
was
expected
to
open
the
tulip
was
taken
away
by
this
young
woman
she
carried
it
to
her
room
from
which
i
had
the
good
luck
to
recover
it
at
the
very
moment
when
she
had
the
impudence
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
announce
to
the
members
of
the
horticultural
society
that
she
had
produced
the
grand
black
tulip
but
she
did
not
stop
there
there
is
no
doubt
that
during
the
few
hours
which
she
kept
the
flower
in
her
room
she
showed
it
to
some
persons
whom
she
may
now
call
as
witnesses
but
fortunately
your
highness
has
now
been
warned
against
this
impostor
and
her
oh
my
god
my
god
what
infamous
falsehoods
said
rosa
bursting
into
tears
and
throwing
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
stadtholder
who
although
thinking
her
guilty
felt
pity
for
her
dreadful
agony
you
have
done
very
wrong
my
child
he
said
and
your
lover
shall
be
punished
for
having
thus
badly
advised
you
for
you
are
so
young
and
have
such
an
honest
look
that
i
am
inclined
to
believe
the
mischief
to
have
been
his
doing
and
not
monseigneur
monseigneur
cried
rosa
cornelius
is
not
william
started
not
guilty
of
having
advised
you
that
s
what
you
want
to
say
is
it
not
what
i
wish
to
say
your
highness
is
that
cornelius
is
as
little
guilty
of
the
second
crime
imputed
to
him
as
he
was
of
the
of
the
first
and
do
you
know
what
was
his
first
crime
do
you
know
of
what
he
was
accused
and
convicted
of
having
as
an
accomplice
of
cornelius
de
witt
concealed
the
correspondence
of
the
grand
pensionary
and
the
marquis
de
well
sir
he
was
ignorant
of
this
correspondence
being
deposited
with
him
completely
ignorant
i
am
as
certain
as
of
my
life
that
if
it
were
not
so
he
would
have
told
me
for
how
could
that
pure
mind
have
harboured
a
secret
without
revealing
it
to
me
no
no
your
highness
i
repeat
it
and
even
at
the
risk
of
incurring
your
displeasure
cornelius
is
no
more
guilty
of
the
first
crime
than
of
the
second
and
of
the
second
no
more
than
of
the
first
oh
would
to
heaven
that
you
knew
my
cornelius
monseigneur
he
is
a
de
witt
cried
boxtel
his
highness
knows
only
too
much
of
him
having
once
granted
him
his
silence
said
the
prince
all
these
affairs
of
state
as
i
have
already
said
are
completely
out
of
the
province
of
the
horticultural
society
of
then
knitting
his
brow
he
added
as
to
the
tulip
make
yourself
easy
master
boxtel
you
shall
have
justice
done
to
boxtel
bowed
with
a
heart
full
of
joy
and
received
the
congratulations
of
the
president
you
my
child
william
of
orange
continued
you
were
going
to
commit
a
crime
i
will
not
punish
you
but
the
real
shall
pay
the
penalty
for
both
a
man
of
his
name
may
be
a
conspirator
and
even
a
traitor
but
he
ought
not
to
be
a
a
thief
cried
rosa
cornelius
a
thief
pray
your
highness
do
not
say
such
a
word
it
would
kill
him
if
he
knew
it
if
theft
there
has
been
i
swear
to
you
sir
no
one
else
but
this
man
has
committed
prove
it
boxtel
coolly
remarked
i
shall
prove
it
with
god
s
help
i
then
turning
towards
boxtel
she
asked
the
tulip
is
yours
it
how
many
bulbs
were
there
of
it
boxtel
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
after
a
short
consideration
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
would
not
ask
this
question
if
there
were
none
besides
the
two
bulbs
of
which
he
had
known
already
he
therefore
answered
what
has
become
of
these
bulbs
oh
what
has
become
of
them
well
one
has
failed
the
second
has
produced
the
black
and
the
third
the
third
the
third
where
is
it
i
have
it
at
home
said
boxtel
quite
confused
at
home
where
at
loewestein
or
at
dort
at
dort
said
boxtel
you
lie
cried
rosa
monseigneur
she
continued
whilst
turning
round
to
the
prince
i
will
tell
you
the
true
story
of
these
three
bulbs
the
first
was
crushed
by
my
father
in
the
prisoner
s
cell
and
this
man
is
quite
aware
of
it
for
he
himself
wanted
to
get
hold
of
it
and
being
balked
in
his
hope
he
very
nearly
fell
out
with
my
father
who
had
been
the
cause
of
his
disappointment
the
second
bulb
planted
by
me
has
produced
the
black
tulip
and
the
third
and
last
saying
this
she
drew
it
from
her
bosom
here
it
is
in
the
very
same
paper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
up
together
with
the
two
others
when
about
to
be
led
to
the
scaffold
cornelius
van
baerle
gave
me
all
the
three
take
it
monseigneur
take
and
rosa
unfolding
the
paper
offered
the
bulb
to
the
prince
who
took
it
from
her
hands
and
examined
it
but
monseigneur
this
young
woman
may
have
stolen
the
bulb
as
she
did
the
tulip
boxtel
said
with
a
faltering
voice
and
evidently
alarmed
at
the
attention
with
which
the
prince
examined
the
bulb
and
even
more
at
the
movements
of
rosa
who
was
reading
some
lines
written
on
the
paper
which
remained
in
her
hands
her
eyes
suddenly
lighted
up
she
read
with
breathless
anxiety
the
mysterious
paper
over
and
over
again
and
at
last
uttering
a
cry
held
it
out
to
the
prince
and
said
read
monseigneur
for
heaven
s
sake
read
william
handed
the
third
bulb
to
van
systens
took
the
paper
and
read
no
sooner
had
he
looked
at
it
than
he
began
to
stagger
his
hand
trembled
and
very
nearly
let
the
paper
fall
to
the
ground
and
the
expression
of
pain
and
compassion
in
his
features
was
really
frightful
to
see
it
was
that
taken
from
the
bible
which
cornelius
de
witt
had
sent
to
dort
by
craeke
the
servant
of
his
brother
john
to
request
van
baerle
to
burn
the
correspondence
of
the
grand
pensionary
with
the
marquis
de
louvois
this
request
as
the
reader
may
remember
was
couched
in
the
following
terms
my
dear
godson
burn
the
parcel
which
i
have
intrusted
to
you
burn
it
without
looking
at
it
and
without
opening
it
so
that
its
contents
may
for
ever
remain
unknown
to
yourself
secrets
of
this
description
are
death
to
those
with
whom
they
are
deposited
burn
it
and
you
will
have
saved
john
and
cornelius
de
witt
farewell
and
love
me
cornelius
de
witt
august
this
slip
of
paper
offered
the
proofs
both
of
van
baerle
s
innocence
and
of
his
claim
to
the
property
of
the
tulip
rosa
and
the
stadtholder
exchanged
one
look
only
that
of
rosa
was
meant
to
express
here
you
see
that
of
the
stadtholder
signified
be
quiet
and
the
prince
wiped
the
cold
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
slowly
folded
up
the
paper
whilst
his
thoughts
were
wandering
in
that
labyrinth
without
a
goal
and
without
a
guide
which
is
called
remorse
and
shame
for
the
past
soon
however
raising
his
head
with
an
effort
he
said
in
his
usual
voice
go
boxtel
justice
shall
be
done
i
promise
then
turning
to
the
president
he
added
you
my
dear
mynheer
van
systens
take
charge
of
this
young
woman
and
of
the
tulip
all
bowed
and
the
prince
left
among
the
deafening
cheers
of
the
crowd
outside
boxtel
returned
to
his
inn
rather
puzzled
and
uneasy
tormented
by
misgivings
about
that
paper
which
william
had
received
from
the
hand
of
rosa
and
which
his
highness
had
read
folded
up
and
so
carefully
put
in
his
pocket
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
this
rosa
went
up
to
the
tulip
tenderly
kissed
its
leaves
and
with
a
heart
full
of
happiness
and
confidence
in
the
ways
of
god
broke
out
in
the
words
thou
knowest
best
for
what
end
thou
madest
my
good
cornelius
teach
me
to
chapter
the
hymn
of
the
flowers
whilst
the
events
we
have
described
in
our
last
chapter
were
taking
place
the
unfortunate
van
baerle
forgotten
in
his
cell
in
the
fortress
of
loewestein
suffered
at
the
hands
of
gryphus
all
that
a
prisoner
can
suffer
when
his
jailer
has
formed
the
determination
of
playing
the
part
of
hangman
gryphus
not
having
received
any
tidings
of
rosa
or
of
jacob
persuaded
himself
that
all
that
had
happened
was
the
devil
s
work
and
that
cornelius
van
baerle
had
been
sent
on
earth
by
satan
the
result
of
it
was
that
one
fine
morning
the
third
after
the
disappearance
of
jacob
and
rosa
he
went
up
to
the
cell
of
cornelius
in
even
a
greater
rage
than
usual
the
latter
leaning
with
his
elbows
on
the
and
supporting
his
head
with
his
two
hands
whilst
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
distant
hazy
horizon
where
the
windmills
of
dort
were
turning
their
sails
was
breathing
the
fresh
air
in
order
to
be
able
to
keep
down
his
tears
and
to
fortify
himself
in
his
philosophy
the
pigeons
were
still
there
but
hope
was
not
there
there
was
no
future
to
look
forward
to
alas
rosa
being
watched
was
no
longer
able
to
come
could
she
not
write
and
if
so
could
she
convey
her
letters
to
him
no
no
he
had
seen
during
the
two
preceding
days
too
much
fury
and
malignity
in
the
eyes
of
old
gryphus
to
expect
that
his
vigilance
would
relax
even
for
one
moment
moreover
had
not
she
to
suffer
even
worse
torments
than
those
of
seclusion
and
separation
did
this
brutal
blaspheming
drunken
bully
take
revenge
on
his
daughter
like
the
ruthless
fathers
of
the
greek
drama
and
when
the
genièvre
had
heated
his
brain
would
it
not
give
to
his
arm
which
had
been
only
too
well
set
by
cornelius
even
double
force
the
idea
that
rosa
might
perhaps
be
nearly
drove
cornelius
mad
he
then
felt
his
own
powerlessness
he
asked
himself
whether
god
was
just
in
inflicting
so
much
tribulation
on
two
innocent
creatures
and
certainly
in
these
moments
he
began
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
providence
it
is
one
of
the
curses
of
misfortune
that
it
thus
begets
doubt
van
baerle
had
proposed
to
write
to
rosa
but
where
was
she
he
also
would
have
wished
to
write
to
the
hague
to
be
beforehand
with
gryphus
who
he
had
no
doubt
would
by
denouncing
him
do
his
best
to
bring
new
storms
on
his
head
but
how
should
he
write
gryphus
had
taken
the
paper
and
pencil
from
him
and
even
if
he
had
both
he
could
hardly
expect
gryphus
to
despatch
his
letter
then
cornelius
revolved
in
his
mind
all
those
stratagems
resorted
to
by
unfortunate
prisoners
he
had
thought
of
an
attempt
to
escape
a
thing
which
never
entered
his
head
whilst
he
could
see
rosa
every
day
but
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
clearly
he
saw
the
impracticability
of
such
an
attempt
he
was
one
of
those
choice
spirits
who
abhor
everything
that
is
common
and
who
often
lose
a
good
chance
through
not
taking
the
way
of
the
vulgar
that
high
road
of
mediocrity
which
leads
to
everything
how
is
it
possible
said
cornelius
to
himself
that
i
should
escape
from
loewestein
as
grotius
has
done
the
same
thing
before
me
has
not
every
precaution
been
taken
since
are
not
the
windows
barred
are
not
the
doors
of
double
and
even
of
treble
strength
and
the
sentinels
ten
times
more
watchful
and
have
not
i
besides
all
this
an
argus
so
much
the
more
dangerous
as
he
has
the
keen
eyes
of
hatred
finally
is
there
not
one
fact
which
takes
away
all
my
spirit
i
mean
rosa
s
absence
but
suppose
i
should
waste
ten
years
of
my
life
in
making
a
file
to
file
off
my
bars
or
in
braiding
cords
to
let
myself
down
from
the
window
or
in
sticking
wings
on
my
shoulders
to
fly
like
dædalus
but
luck
is
against
me
now
the
file
would
get
dull
the
rope
would
break
or
my
wings
would
melt
in
the
sun
i
should
surely
kill
myself
i
should
be
picked
up
maimed
and
crippled
i
should
be
labelled
and
put
on
exhibition
in
the
museum
at
the
hague
between
the
doublet
of
william
the
taciturn
and
the
female
walrus
captured
at
stavesen
and
the
only
result
of
my
enterprise
will
have
been
to
procure
me
a
place
among
the
curiosities
of
holland
but
no
and
it
is
much
better
so
some
fine
day
gryphus
will
commit
some
atrocity
i
am
losing
my
patience
since
i
have
lost
the
joy
and
company
of
rosa
and
especially
since
i
have
lost
my
tulip
undoubtedly
some
day
or
other
gryphus
will
attack
me
in
a
manner
painful
to
my
or
to
my
love
or
even
threaten
my
personal
safety
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
but
since
my
imprisonment
i
feel
a
strange
and
almost
irresistible
pugnacity
well
i
shall
get
at
the
throat
of
that
old
villain
and
strangle
cornelius
at
these
words
stopped
for
a
moment
biting
his
lips
and
staring
out
before
him
then
eagerly
returning
to
an
idea
which
seemed
to
possess
a
strange
fascination
for
him
he
continued
well
and
once
having
strangled
him
why
should
i
not
take
his
keys
from
him
why
not
go
down
the
stairs
as
if
i
had
done
the
most
virtuous
action
why
not
go
and
fetch
rosa
from
her
room
why
not
tell
her
all
and
jump
from
her
window
into
the
waal
i
am
expert
enough
as
a
swimmer
to
save
both
of
us
rosa
but
oh
heaven
gryphus
is
her
father
whatever
may
be
her
affection
for
me
she
will
never
approve
of
my
having
strangled
her
father
brutal
and
malicious
as
he
has
been
i
shall
have
to
enter
into
an
argument
with
her
and
in
the
midst
of
my
speech
some
wretched
turnkey
who
has
found
gryphus
with
the
in
his
throat
or
perhaps
actually
dead
will
come
along
and
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
then
i
shall
see
the
buytenhof
again
and
the
gleam
of
that
infernal
sword
which
will
not
stop
a
second
time
but
will
make
acquaintance
with
the
nape
of
my
neck
it
will
not
do
cornelius
my
fine
fellow
it
is
a
bad
plan
but
then
what
is
to
become
of
me
and
how
shall
i
find
rosa
again
such
were
the
cogitations
of
cornelius
three
days
after
the
sad
scene
of
separation
from
rosa
at
the
moment
when
we
find
him
standing
at
the
window
and
at
that
very
moment
gryphus
entered
he
held
in
his
hand
a
huge
stick
his
eyes
glistening
with
spiteful
thoughts
a
malignant
smile
played
round
his
lips
and
the
whole
of
his
carriage
and
even
all
his
movements
betokened
bad
and
malicious
intentions
cornelius
heard
him
enter
and
guessed
that
it
was
he
but
did
not
turn
round
as
he
knew
well
that
rosa
was
not
coming
after
him
there
is
nothing
more
galling
to
angry
people
than
the
coolness
of
those
on
whom
they
wish
to
vent
their
spleen
the
expense
being
once
incurred
one
does
not
like
to
lose
it
one
s
passion
is
roused
and
one
s
blood
boiling
so
it
would
be
labour
lost
not
to
have
at
least
a
nice
little
row
gryphus
therefore
on
seeing
that
cornelius
did
not
stir
tried
to
attract
his
attention
by
a
loud
umph
umph
cornelius
was
humming
between
his
teeth
the
hymn
of
flowers
a
sad
but
very
charming
song
we
are
the
daughters
of
the
secret
fire
of
the
fire
which
runs
through
the
veins
of
the
earth
we
are
the
daughters
of
aurora
and
of
the
dew
we
are
the
daughters
of
the
air
we
are
the
daughters
of
the
water
but
we
are
above
all
the
daughters
of
this
song
the
placid
melancholy
of
which
was
still
heightened
by
its
calm
and
sweet
melody
exasperated
gryphus
he
struck
his
stick
on
the
stone
pavement
of
the
cell
and
called
out
halloa
my
warbling
gentleman
don
t
you
hear
me
cornelius
turned
round
merely
saying
good
morning
and
then
began
his
song
again
men
defile
us
and
kill
us
while
loving
us
we
hang
to
the
earth
by
a
thread
this
thread
is
our
root
that
is
to
say
our
life
but
we
raise
on
high
our
arms
towards
ah
you
accursed
sorcerer
you
are
making
game
of
me
i
believe
roared
gryphus
cornelius
continued
for
heaven
is
our
home
our
true
home
as
from
thence
comes
our
soul
as
thither
our
soul
returns
our
soul
that
is
to
say
our
gryphus
went
up
to
the
prisoner
and
said
but
you
don
t
see
that
i
have
taken
means
to
get
you
under
and
to
force
you
to
confess
your
are
you
mad
my
dear
master
gryphus
asked
cornelius
and
as
he
now
for
the
first
time
observed
the
frenzied
features
the
flashing
eyes
and
foaming
mouth
of
the
old
jailer
he
said
bless
the
man
he
is
more
than
mad
he
is
gryphus
flourished
his
stick
above
his
head
but
van
baerle
moved
not
and
remained
standing
with
his
arms
akimbo
it
seems
your
intention
to
threaten
me
master
yes
indeed
i
threaten
you
cried
the
jailer
and
with
what
first
of
all
look
at
what
i
have
in
my
i
think
that
s
a
stick
said
cornelius
calmly
but
i
don
t
suppose
you
will
threaten
me
with
oh
you
don
t
suppose
why
not
because
any
jailer
who
strikes
a
prisoner
is
liable
to
two
penalties
the
first
laid
down
in
article
of
the
regulations
at
loewestein
any
jailer
inspector
or
turnkey
who
lays
hands
upon
any
prisoner
of
state
will
be
yes
who
lays
hands
said
gryphus
mad
with
rage
but
there
is
not
a
word
about
a
stick
in
the
and
the
second
continued
cornelius
which
is
not
written
in
the
regulation
but
which
is
to
be
found
elsewhere
whosoever
takes
up
the
stick
will
be
thrashed
by
the
gryphus
growing
more
and
more
exasperated
by
the
calm
and
sententious
tone
of
cornelius
brandished
his
cudgel
but
at
the
moment
when
he
raised
it
cornelius
rushed
at
him
snatched
it
from
his
hands
and
put
it
under
his
own
arm
gryphus
fairly
bellowed
with
rage
hush
hush
my
good
man
said
cornelius
don
t
do
anything
to
lose
your
ah
you
sorcerer
i
ll
pinch
you
worse
roared
gryphus
i
wish
you
don
t
you
see
my
hand
is
empty
yes
i
see
it
and
i
am
glad
of
you
know
that
it
is
not
generally
so
when
i
come
upstairs
in
the
it
s
true
you
generally
bring
me
the
worst
soup
and
the
most
miserable
rations
one
can
imagine
but
that
s
not
a
punishment
to
me
i
eat
only
bread
and
the
worse
the
bread
is
to
your
taste
the
better
it
is
to
how
so
oh
it
s
a
very
simple
well
tell
it
me
said
gryphus
very
willingly
i
know
that
in
giving
me
bad
bread
you
think
you
do
me
certainly
i
don
t
give
it
you
to
please
you
you
well
then
i
who
am
a
sorcerer
as
you
know
change
your
bad
into
excellent
bread
which
i
relish
more
than
the
best
cake
and
then
i
have
the
double
pleasure
of
eating
something
that
gratifies
my
palate
and
of
doing
something
that
puts
you
in
a
gryphus
answered
with
a
growl
oh
you
confess
then
that
you
are
a
indeed
i
am
one
i
don
t
say
it
before
all
the
world
because
they
might
burn
me
for
it
but
as
we
are
alone
i
don
t
mind
telling
well
well
well
answered
gryphus
but
if
a
sorcerer
can
change
black
bread
into
white
won
t
he
die
of
hunger
if
he
has
no
bread
at
all
what
s
that
said
cornelius
consequently
i
shall
not
bring
you
any
bread
at
all
and
we
shall
see
how
it
will
be
after
eight
cornelius
grew
pale
and
continued
gryphus
we
ll
begin
this
very
day
as
you
are
such
a
clever
sorcerer
why
you
had
better
change
the
furniture
of
your
room
into
bread
as
to
myself
i
shall
pocket
the
eighteen
sous
which
are
paid
to
me
for
your
but
that
s
murder
cried
cornelius
carried
away
by
the
first
impulse
of
the
very
natural
terror
with
which
this
horrible
mode
of
death
inspired
him
well
gryphus
went
on
in
his
jeering
way
as
you
are
a
sorcerer
you
will
live
cornelius
put
on
a
smiling
face
again
and
said
have
you
not
seen
me
make
the
pigeons
come
here
from
dort
well
said
gryphus
well
a
pigeon
is
a
very
dainty
morsel
and
a
man
who
eats
one
every
day
would
not
starve
i
and
how
about
the
fire
said
gryphus
fire
but
you
know
that
i
m
in
league
with
the
devil
do
you
think
the
devil
will
leave
me
without
fire
why
fire
is
his
proper
a
man
however
healthy
his
appetite
may
be
would
not
eat
a
pigeon
every
day
wagers
have
been
laid
to
do
so
and
those
who
made
them
gave
them
well
but
when
i
am
tired
of
pigeons
i
shall
make
the
fish
of
the
waal
and
of
the
meuse
come
up
to
gryphus
opened
his
large
eyes
quite
bewildered
i
am
rather
fond
of
fish
continued
cornelius
you
never
let
me
have
any
well
i
shall
turn
your
starving
me
to
advantage
and
regale
myself
with
gryphus
nearly
fainted
with
anger
and
with
fright
but
he
soon
rallied
and
said
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
well
as
you
force
me
to
it
and
with
these
words
he
drew
forth
a
and
opened
it
halloa
a
knife
said
cornelius
preparing
to
defend
himself
with
his
stick
chapter
in
which
van
baerle
before
leaving
loewestein
settles
accounts
with
gryphus
the
two
remained
silent
for
some
minutes
gryphus
on
the
offensive
and
van
baerle
on
the
defensive
then
as
the
situation
might
be
prolonged
to
an
indefinite
length
cornelius
anxious
to
know
something
more
of
the
causes
which
had
so
fiercely
exasperated
his
jailer
spoke
first
by
putting
the
question
well
what
do
you
want
after
all
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
want
answered
gryphus
i
want
you
to
restore
to
me
my
daughter
your
daughter
cried
van
baerle
yes
my
daughter
rosa
whom
you
have
taken
from
me
by
your
devilish
magic
now
will
you
tell
me
where
she
is
and
the
attitude
of
gryphus
became
more
and
more
threatening
rosa
is
not
at
loewestein
cried
cornelius
you
know
well
she
is
not
once
more
will
you
restore
her
to
me
i
see
said
cornelius
this
is
a
trap
you
are
laying
for
now
for
the
last
time
will
you
tell
me
where
my
daughter
is
guess
it
you
rogue
if
you
don
t
know
only
wait
only
wait
growled
gryphus
white
with
rage
and
with
quivering
lips
as
his
brain
began
to
turn
ah
you
will
not
tell
me
anything
well
i
ll
unlock
your
teeth
he
advanced
a
step
towards
cornelius
and
said
showing
him
the
weapon
which
he
held
in
his
hands
do
you
see
this
knife
well
i
have
killed
more
than
fifty
black
cocks
with
it
and
i
vow
i
ll
kill
their
master
the
devil
as
well
as
but
you
blockhead
said
cornelius
will
you
really
kill
me
i
shall
open
your
heart
to
see
in
it
the
place
where
you
hide
my
saying
this
gryphus
in
his
frenzy
rushed
towards
cornelius
who
had
barely
time
to
retreat
behind
his
table
to
avoid
the
first
thrust
but
as
gryphus
continued
with
horrid
threats
to
brandish
his
huge
knife
and
as
although
out
of
the
reach
of
his
weapon
yet
as
long
as
it
remained
in
the
madman
s
hand
the
ruffian
might
fling
it
at
him
cornelius
lost
no
time
and
availing
himself
of
the
stick
which
he
held
tight
under
his
arm
dealt
the
jailer
a
vigorous
blow
on
the
wrist
of
that
hand
which
held
the
knife
the
knife
fell
to
the
ground
and
cornelius
put
his
foot
on
it
then
as
gryphus
seemed
bent
upon
engaging
in
a
struggle
which
the
pain
in
his
wrist
and
shame
for
having
allowed
himself
to
be
disarmed
would
have
made
desperate
cornelius
took
a
decisive
step
belaboring
his
jailer
with
the
most
heroic
and
selecting
the
exact
spot
for
every
blow
of
the
terrible
cudgel
it
was
not
long
before
gryphus
begged
for
mercy
but
before
begging
for
mercy
he
had
lustily
roared
for
help
and
his
cries
had
roused
all
the
functionaries
of
the
prison
two
turnkeys
an
inspector
and
three
or
four
guards
made
their
appearance
all
at
once
and
found
cornelius
still
using
the
stick
with
the
knife
under
his
foot
at
the
sight
of
these
witnesses
who
could
not
know
all
the
circumstances
which
had
provoked
and
might
justify
his
offence
cornelius
felt
that
he
was
irretrievably
lost
in
fact
appearances
were
sadly
against
him
in
one
moment
cornelius
was
disarmed
and
gryphus
raised
and
supported
and
bellowing
with
rage
and
pain
he
was
able
to
count
on
his
back
and
shoulders
the
bruises
which
were
beginning
to
swell
like
the
hills
dotting
the
slopes
of
a
mountain
ridge
a
protocol
of
the
violence
practiced
by
the
prisoner
against
his
jailer
was
immediately
drawn
up
and
as
it
was
made
on
the
depositions
of
gryphus
it
certainly
could
not
be
said
to
be
too
tame
the
prisoner
being
charged
with
neither
more
nor
less
than
with
an
attempt
to
murder
for
a
long
time
premeditated
with
open
rebellion
whilst
the
charge
was
made
out
against
cornelius
gryphus
whose
presence
was
no
longer
necessary
after
having
made
his
depositions
was
taken
down
by
his
turnkeys
to
his
lodge
groaning
and
covered
with
bruises
during
this
time
the
guards
who
had
seized
cornelius
busied
themselves
in
charitably
informing
their
prisoner
of
the
usages
and
customs
of
loewestein
which
however
he
knew
as
well
as
they
did
the
regulations
had
been
read
to
him
at
the
moment
of
his
entering
the
prison
and
certain
articles
in
them
remained
fixed
in
his
memory
among
other
things
they
told
him
that
this
regulation
had
been
carried
out
to
its
full
extent
in
the
case
of
a
prisoner
named
mathias
who
in
that
is
to
say
five
years
before
had
committed
a
much
less
violent
act
of
rebellion
than
that
of
which
cornelius
was
guilty
he
had
found
his
soup
too
hot
and
thrown
it
at
the
head
of
the
chief
turnkey
who
in
consequence
of
this
ablution
had
been
put
to
the
inconvenience
of
having
his
skin
come
off
as
he
wiped
his
face
mathias
was
taken
within
twelve
hours
from
his
cell
then
led
to
the
jailer
s
lodge
where
he
was
registered
as
leaving
loewestein
then
taken
to
the
esplanade
from
which
there
is
a
very
fine
prospect
over
a
wide
expanse
of
country
there
they
fettered
his
hands
bandaged
his
eyes
and
let
him
say
his
prayers
hereupon
he
was
invited
to
go
down
on
his
knees
and
the
guards
of
loewestein
twelve
in
number
at
a
sign
from
a
sergeant
very
cleverly
lodged
a
each
in
his
body
in
consequence
of
this
proceeding
mathias
incontinently
did
then
and
there
die
cornelius
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
to
this
delightful
recital
and
then
said
ah
ah
within
twelve
hours
you
say
yes
the
twelfth
hour
had
not
even
struck
if
i
remember
right
said
the
guard
who
had
told
him
the
story
thank
you
said
cornelius
the
guard
still
had
the
smile
on
his
face
with
which
he
accompanied
and
as
it
were
accentuated
his
tale
when
footsteps
and
a
jingling
of
spurs
were
heard
ascending
the
the
guards
fell
back
to
allow
an
officer
to
pass
who
entered
the
cell
of
cornelius
at
the
moment
when
the
clerk
of
loewestein
was
still
making
out
his
report
is
this
no
he
asked
yes
captain
answered
a
officer
then
this
is
the
cell
of
the
prisoner
cornelius
van
baerle
exactly
where
is
the
prisoner
here
i
am
sir
answered
cornelius
growing
rather
pale
notwithstanding
all
his
courage
you
are
cornelius
van
baerle
asked
he
this
time
addressing
the
prisoner
himself
yes
then
follow
oh
oh
said
cornelius
whose
heart
felt
oppressed
by
the
first
dread
of
death
what
quick
work
they
make
here
in
the
fortress
of
loewestein
and
the
rascal
talked
to
me
of
twelve
hours
ah
what
did
i
tell
you
whispered
the
communicative
guard
in
the
ear
of
the
culprit
a
how
so
you
promised
me
twelve
ah
yes
but
here
comes
to
you
an
of
his
highness
even
one
of
his
most
intimate
companions
van
deken
zounds
they
did
not
grant
such
an
honour
to
poor
come
come
said
cornelius
drawing
a
long
breath
come
i
ll
show
to
these
people
that
an
honest
burgher
godson
of
cornelius
de
witt
can
without
flinching
receive
as
many
as
that
saying
this
he
passed
proudly
before
the
clerk
who
being
interrupted
in
his
work
ventured
to
say
to
the
officer
but
captain
van
deken
the
protocol
is
not
yet
it
is
not
worth
while
finishing
it
answered
the
officer
all
right
replied
the
clerk
philosophically
putting
up
his
paper
and
pen
into
a
greasy
and
it
was
written
thought
poor
cornelius
that
i
should
not
in
this
world
give
my
name
either
to
a
child
to
a
flower
or
to
a
book
the
three
things
by
which
a
man
s
memory
is
repressing
his
melancholy
thoughts
he
followed
the
officer
with
a
resolute
heart
and
carrying
his
head
erect
cornelius
counted
the
steps
which
led
to
the
esplanade
regretting
that
he
had
not
asked
the
guard
how
many
there
were
of
them
which
the
man
in
his
official
complaisance
would
not
have
failed
to
tell
him
what
the
poor
prisoner
was
most
afraid
of
during
this
walk
which
he
considered
as
leading
him
to
the
end
of
the
journey
of
life
was
to
see
gryphus
and
not
to
see
rosa
what
savage
satisfaction
would
glisten
in
the
eyes
of
the
father
and
what
sorrow
dim
those
of
the
daughter
how
gryphus
would
glory
in
his
punishment
punishment
rather
savage
vengeance
for
an
eminently
righteous
deed
which
cornelius
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
performed
as
a
bounden
duty
but
rosa
poor
girl
must
he
die
without
a
glimpse
of
her
without
an
opportunity
to
give
her
one
last
kiss
or
even
to
say
one
last
word
of
farewell
and
worst
of
all
must
he
die
without
any
intelligence
of
the
black
tulip
and
regain
his
consciousness
in
heaven
with
no
idea
in
what
direction
he
should
look
to
find
it
in
truth
to
restrain
his
tears
at
such
a
crisis
the
poor
wretch
s
heart
must
have
been
encased
in
more
of
the
aes
triplex
the
triple
brass
than
horace
bestows
upon
the
sailor
who
first
visited
the
terrifying
acroceraunian
shoals
in
vain
did
cornelius
look
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
he
saw
no
sign
either
of
rosa
or
gryphus
on
reaching
the
esplanade
he
bravely
looked
about
for
the
guards
who
were
to
be
his
executioners
and
in
reality
saw
a
dozen
soldiers
assembled
but
they
were
not
standing
in
line
or
carrying
muskets
but
talking
together
so
gayly
that
cornelius
felt
almost
shocked
all
at
once
gryphus
limping
staggering
and
supporting
himself
on
a
crooked
stick
came
forth
from
the
jailer
s
lodge
his
old
eyes
gray
as
those
of
a
cat
were
lit
up
by
a
gleam
in
which
all
his
hatred
was
concentrated
he
then
began
to
pour
forth
such
a
torrent
of
disgusting
imprecations
against
cornelius
that
the
latter
addressing
the
officer
said
i
do
not
think
it
very
becoming
sir
that
i
should
be
thus
insulted
by
this
man
especially
at
a
moment
like
well
hear
me
said
the
officer
laughing
it
is
quite
natural
that
this
worthy
fellow
should
bear
you
a
grudge
you
seem
to
have
given
it
him
very
but
sir
it
was
only
in
never
mind
said
the
captain
shrugging
his
shoulders
like
a
true
philosopher
let
him
talk
what
does
it
matter
to
you
now
the
cold
sweat
stood
on
the
brow
of
cornelius
at
this
answer
which
he
looked
upon
somewhat
in
the
light
of
brutal
irony
especially
as
coming
from
an
officer
of
whom
he
had
heard
it
said
that
he
was
attached
to
the
person
of
the
prince
the
unfortunate
then
felt
that
he
had
no
more
resources
and
no
more
friends
and
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
god
s
will
be
done
he
muttered
bowing
his
head
then
turning
towards
the
officer
who
seemed
complacently
to
wait
until
he
had
finished
his
meditations
he
asked
please
sir
tell
me
now
where
am
i
to
go
the
officer
pointed
to
a
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
which
reminded
him
very
strongly
of
that
which
under
similar
circumstances
had
before
attracted
his
attention
at
buytenhof
enter
said
the
officer
ah
muttered
cornelius
to
himself
it
seems
they
are
not
going
to
treat
me
to
the
honours
of
the
he
uttered
these
words
loud
enough
for
the
chatty
guard
who
was
at
his
heels
to
overhear
him
that
kind
soul
very
likely
thought
it
his
duty
to
give
cornelius
some
new
information
for
approaching
the
door
of
the
carriage
whilst
the
officer
with
one
foot
on
the
step
was
still
giving
some
orders
he
whispered
to
van
baerle
condémned
prisoners
have
sometimes
been
taken
to
their
own
town
to
be
made
an
example
of
and
have
then
been
executed
before
the
door
of
their
own
house
it
s
all
according
to
cornelius
thanked
him
by
signs
and
then
said
to
himself
well
here
is
a
fellow
who
never
misses
giving
consolation
whenever
an
opportunity
presents
itself
in
truth
my
friend
i
m
very
much
obliged
to
you
the
carriage
drove
away
ah
you
villain
you
brigand
roared
gryphus
clinching
his
fists
at
the
victim
who
was
escaping
from
his
clutches
is
it
not
a
shame
that
this
fellow
gets
off
without
having
restored
my
daughter
to
me
if
they
take
me
to
dort
thought
cornelius
i
shall
see
in
passing
my
house
whether
my
poor
borders
have
been
much
chapter
wherein
the
reader
begins
to
guess
the
kind
of
execution
that
was
awaiting
van
baerle
the
carriage
rolled
on
during
the
whole
day
it
passed
on
the
right
of
dort
went
through
rotterdam
and
reached
delft
at
five
o
clock
in
the
evening
at
least
twenty
leagues
had
been
travelled
cornelius
addressed
some
questions
to
the
officer
who
was
at
the
same
time
his
guard
and
his
companion
but
cautious
as
were
his
inquiries
he
had
the
disappointment
of
receiving
no
answer
cornelius
regretted
that
he
had
no
longer
by
his
side
the
chatty
soldier
who
would
talk
without
being
questioned
that
obliging
person
would
undoubtedly
have
given
him
as
pleasant
details
and
exact
explanations
concerning
this
third
strange
part
of
his
adventures
as
he
had
done
concerning
the
first
two
the
travellers
passed
the
night
in
the
carriage
on
the
following
morning
at
dawn
cornelius
found
himself
beyond
leyden
having
the
north
sea
on
his
left
and
the
zuyder
zee
on
his
right
three
hours
after
he
entered
haarlem
cornelius
was
not
aware
of
what
had
passed
at
haarlem
and
we
shall
leave
him
in
ignorance
of
it
until
the
course
of
events
enlightens
him
but
the
reader
has
a
right
to
know
all
about
it
even
before
our
hero
and
therefore
we
shall
not
make
him
wait
we
have
seen
that
rosa
and
the
tulip
like
two
orphan
sisters
had
been
left
by
prince
william
of
orange
at
the
house
of
the
president
van
systens
rosa
did
not
hear
again
from
the
stadtholder
until
the
evening
of
that
day
on
which
she
had
seen
him
face
to
face
toward
evening
an
officer
called
at
van
systen
s
house
he
came
from
his
highness
with
a
request
for
rosa
to
appear
at
the
town
hall
there
in
the
large
council
room
into
which
she
was
ushered
she
found
the
prince
writing
he
was
alone
with
a
large
frisian
greyhound
at
his
feet
which
looked
at
him
with
a
steady
glance
as
if
the
faithful
animal
were
wishing
to
do
what
no
man
could
do
read
the
thoughts
of
his
master
in
his
face
william
continued
his
writing
for
a
moment
then
raising
his
eyes
and
seeing
rosa
standing
near
the
door
he
said
without
laying
down
his
pen
come
here
my
rosa
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
the
table
sit
down
he
said
rosa
obeyed
for
the
prince
was
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
but
he
had
scarcely
turned
them
again
to
his
paper
when
she
bashfully
retired
to
the
door
the
prince
finished
his
letter
during
this
time
the
greyhound
went
up
to
rosa
surveyed
her
and
began
to
caress
her
ah
ah
said
william
to
his
dog
it
s
easy
to
see
that
she
is
a
countrywoman
of
yours
and
that
you
recognise
then
turning
towards
rosa
and
fixing
on
her
his
scrutinising
and
at
the
same
time
impenetrable
glance
he
said
now
my
the
prince
was
scarcely
and
rosa
eighteen
or
twenty
he
might
therefore
perhaps
better
have
said
my
sister
my
child
he
said
with
that
strangely
commanding
accent
which
chilled
all
those
who
approached
him
we
are
alone
let
us
speak
rosa
began
to
tremble
and
yet
there
was
nothing
but
kindness
in
the
expression
of
the
prince
s
face
monseigneur
she
stammered
you
have
a
father
at
loewestein
yes
your
you
do
not
love
him
i
do
not
at
least
not
as
a
daughter
ought
to
do
it
is
not
right
not
to
love
one
s
father
but
it
is
right
not
to
tell
a
rosa
cast
her
eyes
to
the
ground
what
is
the
reason
of
your
not
loving
your
father
he
is
in
what
way
does
he
show
his
wickedness
he
the
all
of
them
but
don
t
you
bear
him
a
grudge
for
some
one
in
particular
my
father
in
particular
mynheer
van
baerle
who
who
is
your
lover
rosa
started
back
a
step
whom
i
love
monseigneur
she
answered
proudly
since
when
asked
the
prince
since
the
day
when
i
first
saw
and
when
was
that
the
day
after
that
on
which
the
grand
pensionary
john
and
his
brother
cornelius
met
with
such
an
awful
the
prince
compressed
his
lips
and
knit
his
brow
and
his
eyelids
dropped
so
as
to
hide
his
eyes
for
an
instant
after
a
momentary
silence
he
resumed
the
conversation
but
to
what
can
it
lead
to
love
a
man
who
is
doomed
to
live
and
die
in
prison
it
will
lead
if
he
lives
and
dies
in
prison
to
my
aiding
him
in
life
and
in
and
would
you
accept
the
lot
of
being
the
wife
of
a
prisoner
as
the
wife
of
mynheer
van
baerle
i
should
under
any
circumstances
be
the
proudest
and
happiest
woman
in
the
world
but
but
what
i
dare
not
say
there
is
something
like
hope
in
your
tone
what
do
you
hope
she
raised
her
moist
and
beautiful
eyes
and
looked
at
william
with
a
glance
full
of
meaning
which
was
calculated
to
stir
up
in
the
recesses
of
his
heart
the
clemency
which
was
slumbering
there
ah
i
understand
you
he
said
rosa
with
a
smile
clasped
her
hands
you
hope
in
me
said
the
prince
yes
umph
the
prince
sealed
the
letter
which
he
had
just
written
and
summoned
one
of
his
officers

said

give

execute
them
as
far
as
they
regard
the
officer
bowed
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
gallop
of
a
horse
was
heard
resounding
in
the
vaulted
archway
my
child
continued
the
prince
the
feast
of
the
tulip

be
on
sunday

haarlem
haarlem
whither
three
days
ago
we
conducted
our
gentle
reader
and
whither
we
request
him
to
follow
us
once
more
in
the
footsteps
of
the
prisoner
is
a
pleasant
city
which
justly
prides
itself
on
being
one
of
the
most
shady
in
all
the
netherlands
while
other
towns
boast
of
the
magnificence
of
their
arsenals
and
and
the
splendour
of
their
shops
and
markets
haarlem
s
claims
to
fame
rest
upon
her
superiority
to
all
other
provincial
cities
in
the
number
and
beauty
of
her
spreading
elms
graceful
poplars
and
more
than
all
upon
her
pleasant
walks
shaded
by
the
lovely
arches
of
magnificent
oaks
lindens
and
chestnuts
haarlem
just
as
her
neighbour
leyden
became
the
centre
of
science
and
her
queen
amsterdam
that
of
commerce
haarlem
preferred
to
be
the
agricultural
or
more
strictly
speaking
the
horticultural
metropolis
in
fact
girt
about
as
she
was
breezy
and
exposed
to
the
sun
s
hot
rays
she
seemed
to
offer
to
gardeners
so
many
more
guarantees
of
success
than
other
places
with
their
heavy
sea
air
and
their
scorching
heat
on
this
account
all
the
serene
souls
who
loved
the
earth
and
its
fruits
had
gradually
gathered
together
at
haarlem
just
as
all
the
nervous
uneasy
spirits
whose
ambition
was
for
travel
and
commerce
had
settled
in
rotterdam
and
amsterdam
and
all
the
politicians
and
selfish
worldlings
at
the
hague
we
have
observed
that
leyden
overflowed
with
scholars
in
like
manner
haarlem
was
devoted
to
the
gentle
pursuits
of
peace
to
music
and
painting
orchards
and
avenues
groves
and
parks
haarlem
went
wild
about
flowers
and
tulips
received
their
full
share
of
worship
haarlem
offered
prizes
for
and
this
fact
brings
us
in
the
most
natural
manner
to
that
celebration
which
the
city
intended
to
hold
on
may
in
honour
of
the
great
black
tulip
immaculate
and
perfect
which
should
gain
for
its
discoverer
one
hundred
thousand
guilders
haarlem
having
placed
on
exhibition
its
favourite
having
advertised
its
love
of
flowers
in
general
and
of
tulips
in
particular
at
a
period
when
the
souls
of
men
were
filled
with
war
and
sedition
haarlem
having
enjoyed
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
admiring
the
very
purest
ideal
of
tulips
in
full
bloom
haarlem
this
tiny
town
full
of
trees
and
of
sunshine
of
light
and
shade
had
determined
that
the
ceremony
of
bestowing
the
prize
should
be
a
fete
which
should
live
for
ever
in
the
memory
of
men
so
much
the
more
reason
was
there
too
in
her
determination
in
that
holland
is
the
home
of
fetes
never
did
sluggish
natures
manifest
more
eager
energy
of
the
singing
and
dancing
sort
than
those
of
the
good
republicans
of
the
seven
provinces
when
amusement
was
the
order
of
the
day
study
the
pictures
of
the
two
teniers
it
is
certain
that
sluggish
folk
are
of
all
men
the
most
earnest
in
tiring
themselves
not
when
they
are
at
work
but
at
play
thus
haarlem
was
thrice
given
over
to
rejoicing
for
a
celebration
was
to
take
place
in
the
first
place
the
black
tulip
had
been
produced
secondly
the
prince
william
of
orange
as
a
true
hollander
had
promised
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
of
its
inauguration
and
thirdly
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
the
states
to
show
to
the
french
at
the
conclusion
of
such
a
disastrous
war
as
that
of
that
the
flooring
of
the
batavian
republic
was
solid
enough
for
its
people
to
dance
on
it
with
the
accompaniment
of
the
cannon
of
their
fleets
the
horticultural
society
of
haarlem
had
shown
itself
worthy
of
its
fame
by
giving
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
for
the
bulb
of
a
tulip
the
town
which
did
not
wish
to
be
outdone
voted
a
like
sum
which
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
that
notable
body
to
solemnise
the
auspicious
event
and
indeed
on
the
sunday
fixed
for
this
ceremony
there
was
such
a
stir
among
the
people
and
such
an
enthusiasm
among
the
townsfolk
that
even
a
frenchman
who
laughs
at
everything
at
all
times
could
not
have
helped
admiring
the
character
of
those
honest
hollanders
who
were
equally
ready
to
spend
their
money
for
the
construction
of
a
that
is
to
say
for
the
support
of
national
honour
as
they
were
to
reward
the
growth
of
a
new
flower
destined
to
bloom
for
one
day
and
to
serve
during
that
day
to
divert
the
ladies
the
learned
and
the
curious
at
the
head
of
the
notables
and
of
the
horticultural
committee
shone
mynheer
van
systens
dressed
in
his
richest
habiliments
the
worthy
man
had
done
his
best
to
imitate
his
favourite
flower
in
the
sombre
and
stern
elegance
of
his
garments
and
we
are
bound
to
record
to
his
honour
that
he
had
perfectly
succeeded
in
his
object
dark
crimson
velvet
dark
purple
silk
and
cloth
with
linen
of
dazzling
whiteness
composed
the
festive
dress
of
the
president
who
marched
at
the
head
of
his
committee
carrying
an
enormous
nosegay
like
that
which
a
hundred
and
years
later
monsieur
de
robespierre
displayed
at
the
festival
of
the
supreme
there
was
however
a
little
difference
between
the
two
very
different
from
the
french
tribune
whose
heart
was
so
full
of
hatred
and
ambitious
vindictiveness
was
the
honest
president
who
carried
in
his
bosom
a
heart
as
innocent
as
the
flowers
which
he
held
in
his
hand
behind
the
committee
who
were
as
gay
as
a
meadow
and
as
fragrant
as
a
garden
in
spring
marched
the
learned
societies
of
the
town
the
magistrates
the
military
the
nobles
and
the
boors
the
people
even
among
the
respected
republicans
of
the
seven
provinces
had
no
place
assigned
to
them
in
the
procession
they
merely
lined
the
streets
this
is
the
place
for
the
multitude
which
with
true
philosophic
spirit
waits
until
the
triumphal
pageants
have
passed
to
know
what
to
say
of
them
and
sometimes
also
to
know
what
to
do
this
time
however
there
was
no
question
either
of
the
triumph
of
pompey
or
of
cæsar
neither
of
the
defeat
of
mithridates
nor
of
the
conquest
of
gaul
the
procession
was
as
placid
as
the
passing
of
a
flock
of
lambs
and
as
inoffensive
as
a
flight
of
birds
sweeping
through
the
air
haarlem
had
no
other
triumphers
except
its
gardeners
worshipping
flowers
haarlem
idolised
the
florist
in
the
centre
of
this
pacific
and
fragrant
cortege
the
black
tulip
was
seen
carried
on
a
litter
which
was
covered
with
white
velvet
and
fringed
with
gold
the
handles
of
the
litter
were
supported
by
four
men
who
were
from
time
to
time
relieved
by
fresh
relays
even
as
the
bearers
of
mother
cybele
used
to
take
turn
and
turn
about
at
rome
in
the
ancient
days
when
she
was
brought
from
etruria
to
the
eternal
city
amid
the
blare
of
trumpets
and
the
worship
of
a
whole
nation
this
public
exhibition
of
the
tulip
was
an
act
of
adoration
rendered
by
an
entire
nation
unlettered
and
unrefined
to
the
refinement
and
culture
of
its
illustrious
and
devout
leaders
whose
blood
had
stained
the
foul
pavement
of
the
buytenhof
reserving
the
right
at
a
future
day
to
inscribe
the
names
of
its
victims
upon
the
highest
stone
of
the
dutch
pantheon
it
was
arranged
that
the
prince
stadtholder
himself
should
give
the
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
which
interested
the
people
at
large
and
it
was
thought
that
perhaps
he
would
make
a
speech
which
interested
more
particularly
his
friends
and
enemies
for
in
the
most
insignificant
words
of
men
of
political
importance
their
friends
and
their
opponents
always
endeavour
to
detect
and
hence
think
they
can
interpret
something
of
their
true
thoughts
as
if
your
true
politician
s
hat
were
not
a
bushel
under
which
he
always
hides
his
light
at
length
the
great
and
day
may
arrived
and
all
haarlem
swelled
by
her
neighbours
was
gathered
in
the
beautiful
streets
determined
on
this
occasion
not
to
waste
its
applause
upon
military
heroes
or
those
who
had
won
notable
victories
in
the
field
of
science
but
to
reserve
their
applause
for
those
who
had
overcome
nature
and
had
forced
the
inexhaustible
mother
to
be
delivered
of
what
had
theretofore
been
regarded
as
impossible
a
completely
black
tulip
nothing
however
is
more
fickle
than
such
a
resolution
of
the
people
when
a
crowd
is
once
in
the
humour
to
cheer
it
is
just
the
same
as
when
it
begins
to
hiss
it
never
knows
when
to
stop
it
therefore
in
the
first
place
cheered
van
systens
and
his
nosegay
then
the
corporation
then
followed
a
cheer
for
the
people
and
at
last
and
for
once
with
great
justice
there
was
one
for
the
excellent
music
with
which
the
gentlemen
of
the
town
councils
generously
treated
the
assemblage
at
every
halt
every
eye
was
looking
eagerly
for
the
heroine
of
the
festival
that
is
to
say
the
black
tulip
and
for
its
hero
in
the
person
of
the
one
who
had
grown
it
in
case
this
hero
should
make
his
appearance
after
the
address
we
have
seen
worthy
van
systens
at
work
on
so
conscientiously
he
would
not
fail
to
make
as
much
of
a
sensation
as
the
stadtholder
himself
but
the
interest
of
the
day
s
proceedings
for
us
is
centred
neither
in
the
learned
discourse
of
our
friend
van
systens
however
eloquent
it
might
be
nor
in
the
young
dandies
resplendent
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
munching
their
heavy
cakes
nor
in
the
poor
young
peasants
gnawing
smoked
eels
as
if
they
were
sticks
of
vanilla
sweetmeat
neither
is
our
interest
in
the
lovely
dutch
girls
with
red
cheeks
and
ivory
bosoms
nor
in
the
fat
round
mynheers
who
had
never
left
their
homes
before
nor
in
the
sallow
thin
travellers
from
ceylon
or
java
nor
in
the
thirsty
crowds
who
quenched
their
thirst
with
pickled
cucumbers
no
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
real
interest
of
the
situation
the
fascinating
dramatic
interest
is
not
to
be
found
here
our
interest
is
in
a
smiling
sparkling
face
to
be
seen
amid
the
members
of
the
horticultural
committee
in
the
person
with
a
flower
in
his
belt
combed
and
brushed
and
all
clad
in
scarlet
a
colour
which
makes
his
black
hair
and
yellow
skin
stand
out
in
violent
contrast
this
hero
radiant
with
rapturous
joy
who
had
the
distinguished
honour
of
making
the
people
forget
the
speech
of
van
systens
and
even
the
presence
of
the
stadtholder
was
isaac
boxtel
who
saw
carried
on
his
right
before
him
the
black
tulip
his
pretended
daughter
and
on
his
left
in
a
large
purse
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
in
glittering
gold
pieces
towards
which
he
was
constantly
squinting
fearful
of
losing
sight
of
them
for
one
moment
now
and
then
boxtel
quickened
his
step
to
rub
elbows
for
a
moment
with
van
systens
he
borrowed
a
little
importance
from
everybody
to
make
a
kind
of
false
importance
for
himself
as
he
had
stolen
rosa
s
tulip
to
effect
his
own
glory
and
thereby
make
his
fortune
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
prince
will
arrive
and
the
procession
will
halt
for
the
last
time
after
the
tulip
is
placed
on
its
throne
the
prince
yielding
precedence
to
this
rival
for
the
popular
adoration
will
take
a
magnificently
emblazoned
parchment
on
which
is
written
the
name
of
the
grower
and
his
highness
in
a
loud
and
audible
tone
will
proclaim
him
to
be
the
discoverer
of
a
wonder
that
holland
by
the
instrumentality
of
him
boxtel
has
forced
nature
to
produce
a
black
flower
which
shall
henceforth
be
called
tulipa
nigra
boxtellea
from
time
to
time
however
boxtel
withdrew
his
eyes
for
a
moment
from
the
tulip
and
the
purse
timidly
looking
among
the
crowd
for
more
than
anything
he
dreaded
to
descry
there
the
pale
face
of
the
pretty
frisian
girl
she
would
have
been
a
spectre
spoiling
the
joy
of
the
festival
for
him
just
as
banquo
s
ghost
did
that
of
macbeth
and
yet
if
the
truth
must
be
told
this
wretch
who
had
stolen
what
was
the
boast
of
man
and
the
dowry
of
a
woman
did
not
consider
himself
as
a
thief
he
had
so
intently
watched
this
tulip
followed
it
so
eagerly
from
the
drawer
in
cornelius
s
to
the
scaffold
of
the
buytenhof
and
from
the
scaffold
to
the
fortress
of
loewestein
he
had
seen
it
bud
and
grow
in
rosa
s
window
and
so
often
warmed
the
air
round
it
with
his
breath
that
he
felt
as
if
no
one
had
a
better
right
to
call
himself
its
producer
than
he
had
and
any
one
who
would
now
take
the
black
tulip
from
him
would
have
appeared
to
him
as
a
thief
yet
he
did
not
perceive
rosa
his
joy
therefore
was
not
spoiled
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
magnificent
trees
which
were
decorated
with
garlands
and
inscriptions
the
procession
halted
amidst
the
sounds
of
lively
music
and
the
young
damsels
of
haarlem
made
their
appearance
to
escort
the
tulip
to
the
raised
seat
which
it
was
to
occupy
on
the
platform
by
the
side
of
the
gilded
chair
of
his
highness
the
stadtholder
and
the
proud
tulip
raised
on
its
pedestal
soon
overlooked
the
assembled
crowd
of
people
who
clapped
their
hands
and
made
the
old
town
of
haarlem
with
their
tremendous
cheers
chapter
a
last
request
at
this
solemn
moment
and
whilst
the
cheers
still
resounded
a
carriage
was
driving
along
the
road
on
the
outskirts
of
the
green
on
which
the
scene
occurred
it
pursued
its
way
slowly
on
account
of
the
flocks
of
children
who
were
pushed
out
of
the
avenue
by
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
this
carriage
covered
with
dust
and
creaking
on
its
axles
the
result
of
a
long
journey
enclosed
the
unfortunate
van
baerle
who
was
just
beginning
to
get
a
glimpse
through
the
open
window
of
the
scene
which
we
have
tried
with
poor
success
no
doubt
to
present
to
the
eyes
of
the
reader
the
crowd
and
the
noise
and
the
display
of
artificial
and
natural
magnificence
were
as
dazzling
to
the
prisoner
as
a
ray
of
light
flashing
suddenly
into
his
dungeon
notwithstanding
the
little
readiness
which
his
companion
had
shown
in
answering
his
questions
concerning
his
fate
he
ventured
once
more
to
ask
the
meaning
of
all
this
bustle
which
at
first
sight
seemed
to
be
utterly
disconnected
with
his
own
affairs
what
is
all
this
pray
mynheer
lieutenant
he
asked
of
his
conductor
as
you
may
see
sir
replied
the
officer
it
is
a
ah
a
feast
said
cornelius
in
the
sad
tone
of
indifference
of
a
man
to
whom
no
joy
remains
in
this
world
then
after
some
moments
silence
during
which
the
carriage
had
proceeded
a
few
yards
he
asked
once
more
the
feast
of
the
patron
saint
of
haarlem
as
i
see
so
many
it
is
indeed
a
feast
in
which
flowers
play
a
principal
oh
the
sweet
scents
oh
the
beautiful
colours
cried
cornelius
stop
that
the
gentleman
may
see
said
the
officer
with
that
frank
kindliness
which
is
peculiar
to
military
men
to
the
soldier
who
was
acting
as
postilion
oh
thank
you
sir
for
your
kindness
replied
van
baerle
in
a
melancholy
tone
the
joy
of
others
pains
me
please
spare
me
this
just
as
you
wish
drive
on
i
ordered
the
driver
to
stop
because
i
thought
it
would
please
you
as
you
are
said
to
love
flowers
and
especially
that
the
feast
of
which
is
celebrated
and
what
flower
is
that
the
the
tulip
cried
van
baerle
is
the
feast
of
tulips
yes
sir
but
as
this
spectacle
displeases
you
let
us
drive
the
officer
was
about
to
give
the
order
to
proceed
but
cornelius
stopped
him
a
painful
thought
having
struck
him
he
asked
with
faltering
voice
is
the
prize
given
sir
yes
the
prize
for
the
black
cornelius
s
cheek
flushed
his
whole
frame
trembled
and
the
cold
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
alas
sir
he
said
all
these
good
people
will
be
as
unfortunate
as
myself
for
they
will
not
see
the
solemnity
which
they
have
come
to
witness
or
at
least
they
will
see
it
what
is
it
you
mean
to
say
i
mean
to
say
replied
cornelius
throwing
himself
back
in
the
carriage
that
the
black
tulip
will
not
be
found
except
by
one
whom
i
in
this
case
said
the
officer
the
person
whom
you
know
has
found
it
for
the
thing
which
the
whole
of
haarlem
is
looking
at
at
this
moment
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
black
the
black
tulip
replied
van
baerle
thrusting
half
his
body
out
of
the
carriage
window
where
is
it
where
is
it
down
there
on
the
throne
don
t
you
see
i
do
see
come
along
sir
said
the
officer
now
we
must
drive
oh
have
pity
have
mercy
sir
said
van
baerle
don
t
take
me
away
let
me
look
once
more
is
what
i
see
down
there
the
black
tulip
quite
black
is
it
possible
oh
sir
have
you
seen
it
it
must
have
specks
it
must
be
imperfect
it
must
only
be
dyed
black
ah
if
i
were
there
i
should
see
it
at
once
let
me
alight
let
me
see
it
close
i
beg
of
are
you
mad
sir
how
could
i
allow
such
a
thing
i
implore
but
you
forget
that
you
are
a
it
is
true
i
am
a
prisoner
but
i
am
a
man
of
honour
and
i
promise
you
on
my
word
that
i
will
not
run
away
i
will
not
attempt
to
escape
only
let
me
see
the
but
my
orders
sir
my
and
the
officer
again
made
the
driver
a
sign
to
proceed
cornelius
stopped
him
once
more
oh
be
forbearing
be
generous
my
whole
life
depends
upon
your
pity
alas
perhaps
it
will
not
be
much
longer
you
don
t
know
sir
what
i
suffer
you
don
t
know
the
struggle
going
on
in
my
heart
and
mind
for
after
all
cornelius
cried
in
despair
if
this
were
my
tulip
if
it
were
the
one
which
has
been
stolen
from
rosa
oh
i
must
alight
sir
i
must
see
the
flower
you
may
kill
me
afterwards
if
you
like
but
i
will
see
it
i
must
see
be
quiet
unfortunate
man
and
come
quickly
back
into
the
carriage
for
here
is
the
escort
of
his
highness
the
stadtholder
and
if
the
prince
observed
any
disturbance
or
heard
any
noise
it
would
be
ruin
to
me
as
well
as
to
van
baerle
more
afraid
for
his
companion
than
himself
threw
himself
back
into
the
carriage
but
he
could
only
keep
quiet
for
half
a
minute
and
the
first
twenty
horsemen
had
scarcely
passed
when
he
again
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
window
gesticulating
imploringly
towards
the
stadtholder
at
the
very
moment
when
he
passed
william
impassible
and
quiet
as
usual
was
proceeding
to
the
green
to
fulfil
his
duty
as
chairman
he
held
in
his
hand
the
roll
of
parchment
which
on
this
festive
day
had
become
his
baton
seeing
the
man
gesticulate
with
imploring
mien
and
perhaps
also
recognising
the
officer
who
accompanied
him
his
highness
ordered
his
carriage
to
stop
in
an
instant
his
snorting
steeds
stood
still
at
a
distance
of
about
six
yards
from
the
carriage
in
which
van
baerle
was
caged
what
is
this
the
prince
asked
the
officer
who
at
the
first
order
of
the
stadtholder
had
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
and
was
respectfully
approaching
him
monseigneur
he
cried
this
is
the
prisoner
of
state
whom
i
have
fetched
from
loewestein
and
whom
i
have
brought
to
haarlem
according
to
your
highness
s
what
does
he
want
he
entreats
for
permission
to
stop
here
for
to
see
the
black
tulip
monseigneur
said
van
baerle
clasping
his
hands
and
when
i
have
seen
it
when
i
have
seen
what
i
desire
to
know
i
am
quite
ready
to
die
if
die
i
must
but
in
dying
i
shall
bless
your
highness
s
mercy
for
having
allowed
me
to
witness
the
glorification
of
my
it
was
indeed
a
curious
spectacle
to
see
these
two
men
at
the
windows
of
their
several
carriages
the
one
surrounded
by
his
guards
and
all
powerful
the
other
a
prisoner
and
miserable
the
one
going
to
mount
a
throne
the
other
believing
himself
to
be
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
william
looking
with
his
cold
glance
on
cornelius
listened
to
his
anxious
and
urgent
request
then
addressing
himself
to
the
officer
he
said
is
this
person
the
mutinous
prisoner
who
has
attempted
to
kill
his
jailer
at
loewestein
cornelius
heaved
a
sigh
and
hung
his
head
his
honest
face
turned
pale
and
red
at
the
same
instant
these
words
of
the
prince
who
by
some
secret
messenger
unavailable
to
other
mortals
had
already
been
apprised
of
his
crime
seemed
to
him
to
forebode
not
only
his
doom
but
also
the
refusal
of
his
last
request
he
did
not
try
to
make
a
struggle
or
to
defend
himself
and
he
presented
to
the
prince
the
affecting
spectacle
of
despairing
innocence
like
that
of
a
child
a
spectacle
which
was
fully
understood
and
felt
by
the
great
mind
and
the
great
heart
of
him
who
observed
it
allow
the
prisoner
to
alight
and
let
him
see
the
black
tulip
it
is
well
worth
being
seen
thank
you
monseigneur
thank
you
said
cornelius
nearly
swooning
with
joy
and
staggering
on
the
steps
of
his
carriage
had
not
the
officer
supported
him
our
poor
friend
would
have
made
his
thanks
to
his
highness
prostrate
on
his
knees
with
his
forehead
in
the
dust
after
having
granted
this
permission
the
prince
proceeded
on
his
way
over
the
green
amidst
the
most
enthusiastic
acclamations
he
soon
arrived
at
the
platform
and
the
thunder
of
cannon
shook
the
air
chapter
conclusion
van
baerle
led
by
four
guards
who
pushed
their
way
through
the
crowd
sidled
up
to
the
black
tulip
towards
which
his
gaze
was
attracted
with
increasing
interest
the
nearer
he
approached
to
it
he
saw
it
at
last
that
unique
flower
which
he
was
to
see
once
and
no
more
he
saw
it
at
the
distance
of
six
paces
and
was
delighted
with
its
perfection
and
gracefulness
he
saw
it
surrounded
by
young
and
beautiful
girls
who
formed
as
it
were
a
guard
of
honour
for
this
queen
of
excellence
and
purity
and
yet
the
more
he
ascertained
with
his
own
eyes
the
perfection
of
the
flower
the
more
wretched
and
miserable
he
felt
he
looked
all
around
for
some
one
to
whom
he
might
address
only
one
question
but
his
eyes
everywhere
met
strange
faces
and
the
attention
of
all
was
directed
towards
the
chair
of
state
on
which
the
stadtholder
had
seated
himself
william
rose
casting
a
tranquil
glance
over
the
enthusiastic
crowd
and
his
keen
eyes
rested
by
turns
on
the
three
extremities
of
a
triangle
formed
opposite
to
him
by
three
persons
of
very
different
interests
and
feelings
at
one
of
the
angles
boxtel
trembling
with
impatience
and
quite
absorbed
in
watching
the
prince
the
guilders
the
black
tulip
and
the
crowd
at
the
other
cornelius
panting
for
breath
silent
and
his
attention
his
eyes
his
life
his
heart
his
love
quite
concentrated
on
the
black
tulip
and
thirdly
standing
on
a
raised
step
among
the
maidens
of
haarlem
a
beautiful
frisian
girl
dressed
in
fine
scarlet
woollen
cloth
embroidered
with
silver
and
covered
with
a
lace
veil
which
fell
in
rich
folds
from
her
of
gold
brocade
in
one
word
rosa
who
faint
and
with
swimming
eyes
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
officers
of
william
the
prince
then
slowly
unfolded
the
parchment
and
said
with
a
calm
clear
voice
which
although
low
made
itself
perfectly
heard
amidst
the
respectful
silence
which
all
at
once
arrested
the
breath
of
fifty
thousand
spectators
you
know
what
has
brought
us
here
a
prize
of
one
hundred
thousand
guilders
has
been
promised
to
whosoever
should
grow
the
black
tulip
the
black
tulip
has
been
grown
here
it
is
before
your
eyes
coming
up
to
all
the
conditions
required
by
the
programme
of
the
horticultural
society
of
haarlem
the
history
of
its
production
and
the
name
of
its
grower
will
be
inscribed
in
the
book
of
honour
of
the
city
let
the
person
approach
to
whom
the
black
tulip
in
pronouncing
these
words
the
prince
to
judge
of
the
effect
they
produced
surveyed
with
his
eagle
eye
the
three
extremities
of
the
triangle
he
saw
boxtel
rushing
forward
he
saw
cornelius
make
an
involuntary
movement
and
lastly
he
saw
the
officer
who
was
taking
care
of
rosa
lead
or
rather
push
her
forward
towards
him
at
the
sight
of
rosa
a
double
cry
arose
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
prince
boxtel
thunderstruck
and
cornelius
in
joyful
amazement
both
exclaimed
rosa
rosa
this
tulip
is
yours
is
it
not
my
child
said
the
prince
yes
monseigneur
stammered
rosa
whose
striking
beauty
excited
a
general
murmur
of
applause
oh
muttered
cornelius
she
has
then
belied
me
when
she
said
this
flower
was
stolen
from
her
oh
that
s
why
she
left
loewestein
alas
am
i
then
forgotten
betrayed
by
her
whom
i
thought
my
best
friend
on
earth
oh
sighed
boxtel
i
am
this
tulip
continued
the
prince
will
therefore
bear
the
name
of
its
producer
and
figure
in
the
catalogue
under
the
title
tulipa
nigra
rosa
barlœnsis
because
of
the
name
van
baerle
which
will
henceforth
be
the
name
of
this
and
at
the
same
time
william
took
rosa
s
hand
and
placed
it
in
that
of
a
young
man
who
rushed
forth
pale
and
beyond
himself
with
joy
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
saluting
alternately
the
prince
and
his
bride
and
who
with
a
grateful
look
to
heaven
returned
his
thanks
to
the
giver
of
all
this
happiness
at
the
same
moment
there
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
president
van
systens
another
man
struck
down
by
a
very
different
emotion
boxtel
crushed
by
the
failure
of
his
hopes
lay
senseless
on
the
ground
when
they
raised
him
and
examined
his
pulse
and
his
heart
he
was
quite
dead
this
incident
did
not
much
disturb
the
festival
as
neither
the
prince
nor
the
president
seemed
to
mind
it
much
cornelius
started
back
in
dismay
when
in
the
thief
in
the
pretended
jacob
he
recognised
his
neighbour
isaac
boxtel
whom
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
he
had
not
for
one
instant
suspected
of
such
a
wicked
action
then
to
the
sound
of
trumpets
the
procession
marched
back
without
any
change
in
its
order
except
that
boxtel
was
now
dead
and
that
cornelius
and
rosa
were
walking
triumphantly
side
by
side
and
hand
in
hand
on
their
arriving
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
the
prince
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
purse
with
the
hundred
thousand
guilders
said
to
cornelius
it
is
difficult
to
say
by
whom
this
money
is
gained
by
you
or
by
rosa
for
if
you
have
found
the
black
tulip
she
has
nursed
it
and
brought
it
into
flower
it
would
therefore
be
unjust
to
consider
it
as
her
dowry
it
is
the
gift
of
the
town
of
haarlem
to
the
cornelius
wondered
what
the
prince
was
driving
at
the
latter
continued
i
give
to
rosa
the
sum
of
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
which
she
has
fairly
earned
and
which
she
can
offer
to
you
they
are
the
reward
of
her
love
her
courage
and
her
honesty
as
to
you
sir
thanks
to
rosa
again
who
has
furnished
the
proofs
of
your
innocence
and
saying
these
words
the
prince
handed
to
cornelius
that
of
the
bible
on
which
was
written
the
letter
of
cornelius
de
witt
and
in
which
the
third
bulb
had
been
wrapped
as
to
you
it
has
come
to
light
that
you
were
imprisoned
for
a
crime
which
you
had
not
committed
this
means
that
you
are
not
only
free
but
that
your
property
will
be
restored
to
you
as
the
property
of
an
innocent
man
can
not
be
confiscated
cornelius
van
baerle
you
are
the
godson
of
cornelius
de
witt
and
the
friend
of
his
brother
john
remain
worthy
of
the
name
you
have
received
from
one
of
them
and
of
the
friendship
you
have
enjoyed
with
the
other
the
two
de
witts
wrongly
judged
and
wrongly
punished
in
a
moment
of
popular
error
were
two
great
citizens
of
whom
holland
is
now
the
prince
after
these
last
words
which
contrary
to
his
custom
he
pronounced
with
a
voice
full
of
emotion
gave
his
hands
to
the
lovers
to
kiss
whilst
they
were
kneeling
before
him
then
heaving
a
sigh
he
said
alas
you
are
very
happy
who
dreaming
only
of
what
perhaps
is
the
true
glory
of
holland
and
forms
especially
her
true
happiness
do
not
attempt
to
acquire
for
her
anything
beyond
new
colours
of
and
casting
a
glance
towards
that
point
of
the
compass
where
france
lay
as
if
he
saw
new
clouds
gathering
there
he
entered
his
carriage
and
drove
off
cornelius
started
on
the
same
day
for
dort
with
rosa
who
sent
her
lover
s
old
housekeeper
as
a
messenger
to
her
father
to
apprise
him
of
all
that
had
taken
place
those
who
thanks
to
our
description
have
learned
the
character
of
old
gryphus
will
comprehend
that
it
was
hard
for
him
to
become
reconciled
to
his
he
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
blows
which
he
had
received
in
that
famous
encounter
to
judge
from
the
weals
which
he
counted
their
number
he
said
amounted
to
but
at
last
in
order
as
he
declared
not
to
be
less
generous
than
his
highness
the
stadtholder
he
consented
to
make
his
peace
appointed
to
watch
over
the
tulips
the
old
man
made
the
rudest
keeper
of
flowers
in
the
whole
of
the
seven
provinces
it
was
indeed
a
sight
to
see
him
watching
the
obnoxious
moths
and
butterflies
killing
slugs
and
driving
away
the
hungry
bees
as
he
had
heard
boxtel
s
story
and
was
furious
at
having
been
the
dupe
of
the
pretended
jacob
he
destroyed
the
sycamore
behind
which
the
envious
isaac
had
spied
into
the
garden
for
the
plot
of
ground
belonging
to
him
had
been
bought
by
cornelius
and
taken
into
his
own
garden
rosa
growing
not
only
in
beauty
but
in
wisdom
also
after
two
years
of
her
married
life
could
read
and
write
so
well
that
she
was
able
to
undertake
by
herself
the
education
of
two
beautiful
children
which
she
had
borne
in
and
both
in
may
the
month
of
flowers
as
a
matter
of
course
one
was
a
boy
the
other
a
girl
the
former
being
called
cornelius
the
other
rosa
van
baerle
remained
faithfully
attached
to
rosa
and
to
his
tulips
the
whole
of
his
life
was
devoted
to
the
happiness
of
his
wife
and
the
culture
of
flowers
in
the
latter
of
which
occupations
he
was
so
successful
that
a
great
number
of
his
varieties
found
a
place
in
the
catalogue
of
holland
the
two
principal
ornaments
of
his
were
those
two
leaves
from
the
bible
of
cornelius
de
witt
in
large
golden
frames
one
of
them
containing
the
letter
in
which
his
godfather
enjoined
him
to
burn
the
correspondence
of
the
marquis
de
louvois
and
the
other
his
own
will
in
which
he
bequeathed
to
rosa
his
bulbs
under
condition
that
she
should
marry
a
young
man
of
from
to
years
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
loved
a
condition
which
was
scrupulously
fulfilled
although
or
rather
because
cornelius
did
not
die
and
to
ward
off
any
envious
attempts
of
another
isaac
boxtel
he
wrote
over
his
door
the
lines
which
grotius
had
on
the
day
of
his
flight
scratched
on
the
walls
of
his
prison
sometimes
one
has
suffered
so
much
that
he
has
the
right
never
to
be
able
to
say
i
am
too
happy
