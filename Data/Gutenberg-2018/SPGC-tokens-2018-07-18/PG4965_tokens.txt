an
incident
the
dinner
hour
of
scotland
sixty
years
since
was
two
it
was
therefore
about
four
of
a
delightful
autumn
afternoon
that
gilfillan
commenced
his
march
in
hopes
although
stirling
was
eighteen
miles
distant
he
might
be
able
by
becoming
a
borrower
of
the
night
for
an
hour
or
two
to
reach
it
that
evening
he
therefore
put
forth
his
strength
and
marched
stoutly
along
at
the
head
of
his
followers
eyeing
our
hero
from
time
to
time
as
if
he
longed
to
enter
into
controversy
with
him
at
length
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
he
slackened
his
pace
till
he
was
alongside
of
his
prisoner
horse
and
after
marching
a
few
steps
in
silence
abreast
of
him
he
suddenly
asked
ye
say
wha
the
carle
was
wi
the
black
coat
and
the
mousted
head
that
was
wi
the
laird
of
cairnvreckan
presbyterian
clergyman
answered
waverley
answered
gilfillan
contemptuously
wretched
erastian
or
rather
an
obscure
prelatist
a
favourer
of
the
black
indulgence
ane
of
thae
dumb
dogs
that
canna
bark
they
tell
ower
a
clash
o
terror
and
a
clatter
o
comfort
in
their
sermons
without
ony
sense
or
savour
or
life
ye
been
fed
in
siccan
a
fauld
belike
i
am
of
the
church
of
england
said
waverley
they
just
replied
the
covenanter
nae
wonder
they
gree
sae
weel
wha
wad
hae
thought
the
goodly
structure
of
the
kirk
of
scotland
built
up
by
our
fathers
in
wad
hae
been
defaced
by
carnal
ends
and
the
corruptions
of
the
time
ay
wha
wad
hae
thought
the
carved
work
of
the
sanctuary
would
hae
been
sae
soon
cut
down
to
this
lamentation
which
one
or
two
of
the
assistants
chorussed
with
a
deep
groan
our
hero
thought
it
unnecessary
to
make
any
reply
whereupon
gilfillan
resolving
that
he
should
be
a
hearer
at
least
if
not
a
disputant
proceeded
in
his
jeremiade
now
is
it
wonderful
when
for
lack
of
exercise
anent
the
call
to
the
service
of
the
altar
and
the
duty
of
the
day
ministers
fall
into
sinful
compliances
with
patronage
and
indemnities
and
oaths
and
bonds
and
other
corruptions
is
it
wonderful
i
say
that
you
sir
and
other
unhappy
persons
should
labour
to
build
up
your
auld
babel
of
iniquity
as
in
the
bluidy
persecuting
times
i
trow
gin
ye
werena
blinded
wi
the
graces
and
favours
and
services
and
enjoyments
and
employments
and
inheritances
of
this
wicked
world
i
could
prove
to
you
by
the
scripture
in
what
a
filthy
rag
ye
put
your
trust
and
that
your
surplices
and
your
copes
and
vestments
are
but
garments
of
the
muckle
harlot
that
sitteth
upon
seven
hills
and
drinketh
of
the
cup
of
abomination
but
i
trow
ye
are
deaf
as
adders
upon
that
side
of
the
head
ay
ye
are
deceived
with
her
enchantments
and
ye
traffic
with
her
merchandise
and
ye
are
drunk
with
the
cup
of
her
fornication
how
much
longer
this
military
theologist
might
have
continued
his
invective
in
which
he
spared
nobody
but
the
scattered
remnant
of
as
he
called
them
is
absolutely
uncertain
his
matter
was
copious
his
voice
powerful
and
his
memory
strong
so
that
there
was
little
chance
of
his
ending
his
exhortation
till
the
party
had
reached
stirling
had
not
his
attention
been
attracted
by
a
pedlar
who
had
joined
the
march
from
a
and
who
sighed
or
groaned
with
great
regularity
at
all
fitting
pauses
of
his
homily
what
may
ye
be
friend
said
the
gifted
gilfillan
puir
pedlar
that
bound
for
stirling
and
craves
the
protection
of
your
honour
party
in
these
kittle
times
ah
your
honour
has
a
notable
faculty
in
searching
and
explaining
the
secret
ay
the
secret
and
obscure
and
incomprehensible
causes
of
the
backslidings
of
the
land
ay
your
honour
touches
the
root
the
matter
said
gilfillan
with
a
more
complacent
voice
than
he
had
hitherto
used
not
me
i
do
not
go
out
to
and
to
steadings
and
to
to
have
herds
and
cottars
and
burghers
pull
off
their
bonnets
to
me
as
they
do
to
major

twenty

had
the
blessing
of

but
the
pride
of
my
heart
has
not
increased
with
them
nor
do
i
delight
to
be
called
captain
though
i
have
the
subscribed
commission
of
that
nobleman

earl
of
glencairn
fa
whilk
i
am

designated
while
i
live

gilfillan
who
will
stand
up
for
the
standards
of
doctrine
agreed
on
by
the
ance
famous
kirk
of
scotland
before
she
trafficked
with
the
accursed
achan
while
he
has
a
plack
in
his
purse
or
a
drap
o
bluid
in
his
body
said
the
pedlar
have
seen
your
land
about
mauchlin
a
fertile
spot
your
lines
have
fallen
in
pleasant
places
and
siccan
a
breed
o
cattle
is
not
in
ony
laird
land
in
scotland
say
right
ye
say
right
friend
retorted
gilfillan
eagerly
for
he
was
not
inaccessible
to
flattery
upon
this
subject
say
right
they
are
the
real
lancashire
and
there
no
the
like
o
them
even
at
the
mains
of
kilmaurs
and
he
then
entered
into
a
discussion
of
their
excellences
to
which
our
readers
will
probably
be
as
indifferent
as
our
hero
after
this
excursion
the
leader
returned
to
his
theological
discussions
while
the
pedlar
less
profound
upon
those
mystic
points
contented
himself
with
groaning
and
expressing
his
edification
at
suitable
intervals
a
blessing
it
would
be
to
the
puir
blinded
popish
nations
among
whom
i
hae
sojourned
to
have
siccan
a
light
to
their
paths
i
hae
been
as
far
as
muscovia
in
my
sma
trading
way
as
a
travelling
merchant
and
i
hae
been
through
france
and
the
low
countries
and
a
poland
and
maist
feck
o
germany
and
o
it
would
grieve
your
honour
soul
to
see
the
murmuring
and
the
singing
and
massing
that
in
the
kirk
and
the
piping
that
in
the
quire
and
the
heathenish
dancing
and
dicing
upon
the
sabbath
this
set
gilfillan
off
upon
the
book
of
sports
and
the
covenant
and
the
engagers
and
the
protesters
and
the
whiggamore
raid
and
the
assembly
of
divines
at
westminster
and
the
longer
and
shorter
catechism
and
the
excommunication
at
torwood
and
the
slaughter
of
archbishop
sharp
this
last
topic
again
led
him
into
the
lawfulness
of
defensive
arms
on
which
subject
he
uttered
much
more
sense
than
could
have
been
expected
from
some
other
parts
of
his
harangue
and
attracted
even
waverley
attention
who
had
hitherto
been
lost
in
his
own
sad
reflections
gilfillan
then
considered
the
lawfulness
of
a
private
standing
forth
as
the
avenger
of
public
oppression
and
as
he
was
labouring
with
great
earnestness
the
cause
of
mas
james
mitchell
who
fired
at
the
archbishop
of
saint
andrews
some
years
before
the
prelate
assassination
on
magus
muir
an
incident
occurred
which
interrupted
his
harangue
the
rays
of
the
sun
were
lingering
on
the
very
verge
of
the
horizon
as
the
party
ascended
a
hollow
and
somewhat
steep
path
which
led
to
the
summit
of
a
rising
ground
the
country
was
uninclosed
being
part
of
a
very
extensive
heath
or
common
but
it
was
far
from
level
exhibiting
in
many
places
hollows
filled
with
furze
and
broom
in
others
little
dingles
of
stunted
brushwood
a
thicket
of
the
latter
description
crowned
the
hill
up
which
the
party
ascended
the
foremost
of
the
band
being
the
stoutest
and
most
active
had
pushed
on
and
having
surmounted
the
ascent
were
out
of
ken
for
the
present
gilfillan
with
the
pedlar
and
the
small
party
who
were
waverley
more
immediate
guard
were
near
the
top
of
the
ascent
and
the
remainder
straggled
after
them
at
a
considerable
interval
such
was
the
situation
of
matters
when
the
pedlar
missing
as
he
said
a
little
doggie
which
belonged
to
him
began
to
halt
and
whistle
for
the
animal
this
signal
repeated
more
than
once
gave
offence
to
the
rigour
of
his
companion
the
rather
because
it
appeared
to
indicate
inattention
to
the
treasures
of
theological
and
controversial
knowledge
which
were
pouring
out
for
his
edification
he
therefore
signified
gruffly
that
he
could
not
waste
his
time
in
waiting
for
an
useless
cur
if
your
honour
wad
consider
the
case
of
tobit
exclaimed
gilffflan
with
great
heat
and
his
dog
baith
are
altogether
heathenish
and
apocryphal
and
none
but
a
prelatist
or
a
papist
would
draw
them
into
question
i
doubt
i
hae
been
in
you
friend
likely
answered
the
pedlar
with
great
composure
i
shall
take
leave
to
whistle
again
upon
puir
bawty
this
last
signal
was
answered
in
an
unexpected
manner
for
six
or
eight
stout
highlanders
who
lurked
among
the
copse
and
brushwood
sprung
into
the
hollow
way
and
began
to
lay
about
them
with
their
claymores
gilfillan
unappalled
at
this
undesirable
apparition
cried
out
manfully
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
and
drawing
his
broadsword
would
probably
have
done
as
much
credit
to
the
good
old
cause
as
any
of
its
doughty
champions
at
drumclog
when
behold
the
pedlar
snatching
a
musket
from
the
person
who
was
next
him
bestowed
the
butt
of
it
with
such
emphasis
on
the
head
of
his
late
instructor
in
the
cameronian
creed
that
he
was
forthwith
levelled
to
the
ground
in
the
confusion
which
ensued
the
horse
which
bore
our
hero
was
shot
by
one
of
party
as
he
discharged
his
firelock
at
random
waverley
fell
with
and
indeed
under
the
animal
and
sustained
some
severe
contusions
but
he
was
almost
instantly
extricated
from
the
fallen
steed
by
two
highlanders
who
each
seizing
him
by
the
arm
hurried
him
away
from
the
scuffle
and
from
the
highroad
they
ran
with
great
speed
half
supporting
and
half
dragging
our
hero
who
could
however
distinguish
a
few
dropping
shots
fired
about
the
spot
which
he
had
left
this
as
he
afterwards
learned
proceeded
from
gilfillan
party
who
had
now
assembled
the
stragglers
in
front
and
rear
having
joined
the
others
at
their
approach
the
highlanders
drew
off
but
not
before
they
had
rifled
gilfillan
and
two
of
his
people
who
remained
on
the
spot
grievously
wounded
a
few
shots
were
exchanged
betwixt
them
and
the
westlanders
but
the
latter
now
without
a
commander
and
apprehensive
of
a
second
ambush
did
not
make
any
serious
effort
to
recover
their
prisoner
judging
it
more
wise
to
proceed
on
their
journey
to
stirling
carrying
with
them
their
wounded
captain
and
comrades
chapter
xxxvii
waverley
is
still
in
distress
the
velocity
and
indeed
violence
with
which
waverley
was
hurried
along
nearly
deprived
him
of
sensation
for
the
injury
he
had
received
from
his
fall
prevented
him
from
aiding
himself
so
effectually
as
he
might
otherwise
have
done
when
this
was
observed
by
his
conductors
they
called
to
their
aid
two
or
three
others
of
the
party
and
swathing
our
hero
body
in
one
of
their
plaids
divided
his
weight
by
that
means
among
them
and
transported
him
at
the
same
rapid
rate
as
before
without
any
exertion
of
his
own
they
spoke
little
and
that
in
gaelic
and
did
not
slacken
their
pace
till
they
had
run
nearly
two
miles
when
they
abated
their
extreme
rapidity
but
continued
still
to
walk
very
fast
relieving
each
other
occasionally
our
hero
now
endeavoured
to
address
them
but
was
only
answered
with
beurl
agam
have
no
english
being
as
waverley
well
knew
the
constant
reply
of
a
highlander
when
he
either
does
not
understand
or
does
not
choose
to
reply
to
an
englishman
or
lowlander
he
then
mentioned
the
name
of
vich
lan
vohr
concluding
that
he
was
indebted
to
his
friendship
for
his
rescue
from
the
clutches
of
gifted
gilfillan
but
neither
did
this
produce
any
mark
of
recognition
from
his
escort
the
twilight
had
given
place
to
moonshine
when
the
party
halted
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipitous
glen
which
as
partly
enlightened
by
the
moonbeams
seemed
full
of
trees
and
tangled
brushwood
two
of
the
highlanders
dived
into
it
by
a
small
as
if
to
explore
its
recesses
and
one
of
them
returning
in
a
few
minutes
said
something
to
his
companions
who
instantly
raised
their
burden
and
bore
him
with
great
attention
and
care
down
the
narrow
and
abrupt
descent
notwithstanding
their
precautions
however
waverley
person
came
more
than
once
into
contact
rudely
enough
with
the
projecting
stumps
and
branches
which
overhung
the
pathway
at
the
bottom
of
the
descent
and
as
it
seemed
by
the
side
of
a
brook
for
waverley
heard
the
rushing
of
a
considerable
body
of
water
although
its
stream
was
invisible
in
the
darkness
the
party
again
stopped
before
a
small
and
hovel
the
door
was
open
and
the
inside
of
the
premises
appeared
as
uncomfortable
and
rude
as
its
situation
and
exterior
foreboded
there
was
no
appearance
of
a
floor
of
any
kind
the
roof
seemed
rent
in
several
places
the
walls
were
composed
of
loose
stones
and
turf
and
the
thatch
of
branches
of
trees
the
fire
was
in
the
centre
and
filled
the
whole
wigwam
with
smoke
which
escaped
as
much
through
the
door
as
by
means
of
a
circular
aperture
in
the
roof
an
old
highland
sibyl
the
only
inhabitant
of
this
forlorn
mansion
appeared
busy
in
the
preparation
of
some
food
by
the
light
which
the
fire
afforded
waverley
could
discover
that
his
attendants
were
not
of
the
clan
of
ivor
for
fergus
was
particularly
strict
in
requiring
from
his
followers
that
they
should
wear
the
tartan
striped
in
the
mode
peculiar
to
their
race
a
mark
of
distinction
anciently
general
through
the
highlands
and
still
maintained
by
those
chiefs
who
were
proud
of
their
lineage
or
jealous
of
their
separate
and
exclusive
authority
edward
had
lived
at
glennaquoich
long
enough
to
be
aware
of
a
distinction
which
he
had
repeatedly
heard
noticed
and
now
satisfied
that
he
had
no
interest
with
his
attendants
he
glanced
a
disconsolate
eye
around
the
interior
of
the
cabin
the
only
furniture
excepting
a
and
a
wooden
press
called
in
scotland
an
ambry
sorely
decayed
was
a
large
wooden
bed
planked
as
is
usual
all
around
and
opening
by
a
sliding
panel
in
this
recess
the
highlanders
deposited
waverley
after
he
had
by
signs
declined
any
refreshment
his
slumbers
were
broken
and
unrefreshing
strange
visions
passed
before
his
eyes
and
it
required
constant
and
reiterated
efforts
of
mind
to
dispel
them
shivering
violent
headache
and
shooting
pains
in
his
limbs
succeeded
these
symptoms
and
in
the
morning
it
was
evident
to
his
highland
attendants
or
guard
for
he
knew
not
in
which
light
to
consider
them
that
waverley
was
quite
unfit
to
travel
after
a
long
consultation
among
themselves
six
of
the
party
left
the
hut
with
their
arms
leaving
behind
an
old
and
a
young
man
the
former
addressed
waverley
and
bathed
the
contusions
which
swelling
and
livid
colour
now
made
conspicuous
his
own
portmanteau
which
the
highlanders
had
not
failed
to
bring
off
supplied
him
with
linen
and
to
his
great
surprise
was
with
all
its
undiminished
contents
freely
resigned
to
his
use
the
bedding
of
his
couch
seemed
clean
and
comfortable
and
his
aged
attendant
closed
the
door
of
the
bed
for
it
had
no
curtain
after
a
few
words
of
gaelic
from
which
waverley
gathered
that
he
exhorted
him
to
repose
so
behold
our
hero
for
a
second
time
the
patient
of
a
highland
esculapius
but
in
a
situation
much
more
uncomfortable
than
when
he
was
the
guest
of
the
worthy
tomanrait
the
symptomatic
fever
which
accompanied
the
injuries
he
had
sustained
did
not
abate
till
the
third
day
when
it
gave
way
to
the
care
of
his
attendants
and
the
strength
of
his
constitution
and
he
could
now
raise
himself
in
his
bed
though
not
without
pain
he
observed
however
that
there
was
a
great
disinclination
on
the
part
of
the
old
woman
who
acted
as
his
nurse
as
well
as
on
that
of
the
elderly
highlander
to
permit
the
door
of
the
bed
to
be
left
open
so
that
he
might
amuse
himself
with
observing
their
motions
and
at
length
after
waverley
had
repeatedly
drawn
open
and
they
had
as
frequently
shut
the
hatchway
of
his
cage
the
old
gentleman
put
an
end
to
the
contest
by
securing
it
on
the
outside
with
a
nail
so
effectually
that
the
door
could
not
be
drawn
till
this
exterior
impediment
was
removed
while
musing
upon
the
cause
of
this
contradictory
spirit
in
persons
whose
conduct
intimated
no
purpose
of
plunder
and
who
in
all
other
points
appeared
to
consult
his
welfare
and
his
wishes
it
occurred
to
our
hero
that
during
the
worst
crisis
of
his
illness
a
female
figure
younger
than
his
old
highland
nurse
had
appeared
to
flit
around
his
couch
of
this
indeed
he
had
but
a
very
indistinct
recollection
but
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
when
attentively
listening
he
often
heard
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
voice
of
another
female
conversing
in
whispers
with
his
attendant
who
could
it
be
and
why
should
she
apparently
desire
concealment
fancy
immediately
aroused
herself
and
turned
to
flora
but
after
a
short
conflict
between
his
eager
desire
to
believe
she
was
in
his
neighbourhood
guarding
like
an
angel
of
mercy
the
couch
of
his
sickness
waverley
was
compelled
to
conclude
that
his
conjecture
was
altogether
improbable
since
to
suppose
she
had
left
her
comparatively
safe
situation
at
glennaquoich
to
descend
into
the
low
country
now
the
seat
of
civil
war
and
to
inhabit
such
a
as
this
was
a
thing
hardly
to
be
imagined
yet
his
heart
bounded
as
he
sometimes
could
distinctly
hear
the
trip
of
a
light
female
step
glide
to
or
from
the
door
of
the
hut
or
the
suppressed
sounds
of
a
female
voice
of
softness
and
delicacy
hold
dialogue
with
the
hoarse
inward
croak
of
old
janet
for
so
he
understood
his
antiquated
attendant
was
denominated
having
nothing
else
to
amuse
his
solitude
he
employed
himself
in
contriving
some
plan
to
gratify
his
curiosity
in
despite
of
the
sedulous
caution
of
janet
and
the
old
highland
janizary
for
he
had
never
seen
the
young
fellow
since
the
first
morning
at
length
upon
accurate
examination
the
infirm
state
of
his
wooden
appeared
to
supply
the
means
of
gratifying
his
curiosity
for
out
of
a
spot
which
was
somewhat
decayed
he
was
able
to
extract
a
nail
through
this
minute
aperture
he
could
perceive
a
female
form
wrapped
in
a
plaid
in
the
act
of
conversing
with
janet
but
since
the
days
of
our
grandmother
eve
the
gratification
of
inordinate
curiosity
has
generally
borne
its
penalty
in
disappointment
the
form
was
not
that
of
flora
nor
was
the
face
visible
and
to
crown
his
vexation
while
he
laboured
with
the
nail
to
enlarge
the
hole
that
he
might
obtain
a
more
complete
view
a
slight
noise
betrayed
his
purpose
and
the
object
of
his
curiosity
instantly
disappeared
nor
so
far
as
he
could
observe
did
she
again
revisit
the
cottage
all
precautions
to
blockade
his
view
were
from
that
time
abandoned
and
he
was
not
only
permitted
but
assisted
to
rise
and
quit
what
had
been
in
a
literal
sense
his
couch
of
confinement
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
leave
the
hut
for
the
young
highlander
had
now
rejoined
his
senior
and
one
or
other
was
constantly
on
the
watch
whenever
waverley
approached
the
cottage
door
the
sentinel
upon
duty
civilly
but
resolutely
placed
himself
against
it
and
opposed
his
exit
accompanying
his
action
with
signs
which
seemed
to
imply
there
was
danger
in
the
attempt
and
an
enemy
in
the
neighbourhood
old
janet
appeared
anxious
and
upon
the
watch
and
waverley
who
had
not
yet
recovered
strength
enough
to
attempt
to
take
his
departure
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
his
hosts
was
under
the
necessity
of
remaining
patient
his
fare
was
in
every
point
of
view
better
than
he
could
have
conceived
for
poultry
and
even
wine
were
no
strangers
to
his
table
the
highlanders
never
presumed
to
eat
with
him
and
unless
in
the
circumstance
of
watching
him
treated
him
with
great
respect
his
sole
amusement
was
gazing
from
the
window
or
rather
the
shapeless
aperture
which
was
meant
to
answer
the
purpose
of
a
window
upon
a
large
and
rough
brook
which
raged
and
foamed
through
a
rocky
channel
closely
canopied
with
trees
and
bushes
about
ten
feet
beneath
the
site
of
his
house
of
captivity
upon
the
sixth
day
of
his
confinement
waverley
found
himself
so
well
that
he
began
to
meditate
his
escape
from
this
dull
and
miserable
thinking
any
risk
which
he
might
incur
in
the
attempt
preferable
to
the
stupefying
and
intolerable
uniformity
of
janet
retirement
the
question
indeed
occurred
whither
he
was
to
direct
his
course
when
again
at
his
own
disposal
two
schemes
seemed
practicable
yet
both
attended
with
danger
and
difficulty
one
was
to
go
back
to
glennaquoich
and
join
fergus
by
whom
he
was
sure
to
be
kindly
received
and
in
the
present
state
of
his
mind
the
rigour
with
which
he
had
been
treated
fully
absolved
him
in
his
own
eyes
from
his
allegiance
to
the
existing
government
the
other
project
was
to
endeavour
to
attain
a
scottish
seaport
and
thence
to
take
shipping
for
england
his
mind
wavered
between
these
plans
and
probably
if
he
had
effected
his
escape
in
the
manner
he
proposed
he
would
have
been
finally
determined
by
the
comparative
facility
by
which
either
might
have
been
executed
but
his
fortune
had
settled
that
he
was
not
to
be
left
to
his
option
upon
the
evening
of
the
seventh
day
the
door
of
the
hut
suddenly
opened
and
two
highlanders
entered
whom
waverley
recognised
as
having
been
a
part
of
his
original
escort
to
this
cottage
they
conversed
for
a
short
time
with
the
old
man
and
his
companion
and
then
made
waverley
understand
by
very
significant
signs
that
he
was
to
prepare
to
accompany
them
this
was
a
joyful
communication
what
had
already
passed
during
his
confinement
made
it
evident
that
no
personal
injury
was
designed
to
him
and
his
romantic
spirit
having
recovered
during
his
repose
much
of
that
elasticity
which
anxiety
resentment
disappointment
and
the
mixture
of
unpleasant
feelings
excited
by
his
late
adventures
had
for
a
time
subjugated
was
now
wearied
with
inaction
his
passion
for
the
wonderful
although
it
is
the
nature
of
such
dispositions
to
be
excited
by
that
degree
of
danger
which
merely
gives
dignity
to
the
feeling
of
the
individual
exposed
to
it
had
sunk
under
the
extraordinary
and
apparently
insurmountable
evils
by
which
he
appeared
environed
at
cairnvreckan
in
fact
this
compound
of
intense
curiosity
and
exalted
imagination
forms
a
peculiar
species
of
courage
which
somewhat
resembles
the
light
usually
carried
by
a
miner
sufficiently
competent
indeed
to
afford
him
guidance
and
comfort
during
the
ordinary
perils
of
his
labour
but
certain
to
be
extinguished
should
he
encounter
the
more
formidable
hazard
of
earth
damps
or
pestiferous
vapours
it
was
now
however
once
more
rekindled
and
with
a
throbbing
mixture
of
hope
awe
and
anxiety
waverley
watched
the
group
before
him
as
those
who
were
just
arrived
snatched
a
hasty
meal
and
the
others
assumed
their
arms
and
made
brief
preparations
for
their
departure
as
he
sat
in
the
smoky
hut
at
some
distance
from
the
fire
around
which
the
others
were
crowded
he
felt
a
gentle
pressure
upon
his
arm
he
looked
round
it
was
alice
the
daughter
of
donald
bean
lean
she
showed
him
a
packet
of
papers
in
such
a
manner
that
the
motion
was
remarked
by
no
one
else
put
her
finger
for
a
second
to
her
lips
and
passed
on
as
if
to
assist
old
janet
in
packing
waverley
clothes
in
his
portmanteau
it
was
obviously
her
wish
that
he
should
not
seem
to
recognise
her
yet
she
repeatedly
looked
back
at
him
as
an
opportunity
occurred
of
doing
so
unobserved
and
when
she
saw
that
he
remarked
what
she
did
she
folded
the
packet
with
great
address
and
speed
in
one
of
his
shirts
which
she
deposited
in
the
portmanteau
here
then
was
fresh
food
for
conjecture
was
alice
his
unknown
warden
and
was
this
maiden
of
the
cavern
the
tutelar
genius
that
watched
his
bed
during
his
sickness
was
he
in
the
hands
of
her
father
and
if
so
what
was
his
purpose
spoil
his
usual
object
seemed
in
this
case
neglected
for
not
only
waverley
property
was
restored
but
his
purse
which
might
have
tempted
this
professional
plunderer
had
been
all
along
suffered
to
remain
in
his
possession
all
this
perhaps
the
packet
might
explain
but
it
was
plain
from
alice
manner
that
she
desired
he
should
consult
it
in
secret
nor
did
she
again
seek
his
eye
after
she
had
satisfied
herself
that
her
manoeuvre
was
observed
and
understood
on
the
contrary
she
shortly
afterwards
left
the
hut
and
it
was
only
as
she
tript
out
from
the
door
that
favoured
by
the
obscurity
she
gave
waverley
a
parting
smile
and
nod
of
significance
ere
she
vanished
in
the
dark
glen
the
young
highlander
was
repeatedly
despatched
by
his
comrades
as
if
to
collect
intelligence
at
length
when
he
had
returned
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
the
whole
party
arose
and
made
signs
to
our
hero
to
accompany
them
before
his
departure
however
he
shook
hands
with
old
janet
who
had
been
so
sedulous
in
his
behalf
and
added
substantial
marks
of
his
gratitude
for
her
attendance
bless
you
god
prosper
you
captain
waverley
said
janet
in
good
lowland
scotch
though
he
had
never
hithero
heard
her
utter
a
syllable
save
in
gaelic
but
the
impatience
of
his
attendants
prohibited
his
asking
any
explanation
chapter
xxxviii
a
nocturnal
adventure
there
was
a
moment
pause
when
the
whole
party
had
got
out
of
the
hut
and
the
highlander
who
assumed
the
command
and
who
in
waverley
awakened
recollection
seemed
to
be
the
same
tall
figure
who
had
acted
as
donald
bean
lean
lieutenant
by
whispers
and
signs
imposed
the
strictest
silence
he
delivered
to
edward
a
sword
and
steel
pistol
and
pointing
up
the
track
laid
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
own
claymore
as
if
to
make
him
sensible
they
might
have
occasion
to
use
force
to
make
good
their
passage
he
then
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
party
who
moved
up
the
pathway
in
single
or
indian
file
waverley
being
placed
nearest
to
their
leader
he
moved
with
great
precaution
as
if
to
avoid
giving
any
alarm
and
halted
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
verge
of
the
ascent
waverley
was
soon
sensible
of
the
reason
for
he
heard
at
no
great
distance
an
english
sentinel
call
out
well
the
heavy
sound
sunk
on
the
down
the
woody
glen
and
was
answered
by
the
echoes
of
its
banks
a
second
third
and
fourth
time
the
signal
was
repeated
fainter
and
fainter
as
if
at
a
greater
and
greater
distance
it
was
obvious
that
a
party
of
soldiers
were
near
and
upon
their
guard
though
not
sufficiently
so
to
detect
men
skilful
in
every
art
of
predatory
warfare
like
those
with
whom
he
now
watched
their
ineffectual
precautions
when
these
sounds
had
died
upon
the
silence
of
the
night
the
highlanders
began
their
march
swiftly
yet
with
the
most
cautious
silence
waverley
had
little
time
or
indeed
disposition
for
observation
and
could
only
discern
that
they
passed
at
some
distance
from
a
large
building
in
the
windows
of
which
a
light
or
two
yet
seemed
to
twinkle
a
little
farther
on
the
leading
highlander
snuffed
the
wind
like
a
setting
spaniel
and
then
made
a
signal
to
his
party
again
to
halt
he
stooped
down
upon
all
fours
wrapped
up
in
his
plaid
so
as
to
be
scarce
distinguishable
from
the
heathy
ground
on
which
he
moved
and
advanced
in
this
posture
to
reconnoitre
in
a
short
time
he
returned
and
dismissed
his
attendants
excepting
one
and
intimating
to
waverley
that
he
must
imitate
his
cautious
mode
of
proceeding
all
three
crept
forward
on
hands
and
knees
after
proceeding
a
greater
way
in
this
inconvenient
manner
than
was
at
all
comfortable
to
his
knees
and
shins
waverley
perceived
the
smell
of
smoke
which
probably
had
been
much
sooner
distinguished
by
the
more
acute
nasal
organs
of
his
guide
it
proceeded
from
the
corner
of
a
low
and
ruinous
the
walls
of
which
were
made
of
loose
stones
as
is
usual
in
scotland
close
by
this
low
wall
the
highlander
guided
waverley
and
in
order
probably
to
make
him
sensible
of
his
danger
or
perhaps
to
obtain
the
full
credit
of
his
own
dexterity
he
intimated
to
him
by
sign
and
example
that
he
might
raise
his
head
so
as
to
peep
into
the
waverley
did
so
and
beheld
an
outpost
of
four
or
five
soldiers
lying
by
their
they
were
all
asleep
except
the
sentinel
who
paced
backwards
and
forwards
with
his
firelock
on
his
shoulder
which
glanced
red
in
the
light
of
the
fire
as
he
crossed
and
before
it
in
his
short
walk
casting
his
eye
frequently
to
that
part
of
the
heavens
from
which
the
moon
hitherto
obscured
by
mist
seemed
now
about
to
make
her
appearance
in
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
by
one
of
those
sudden
changes
of
atmosphere
incident
to
a
mountainous
country
a
breeze
arose
and
swept
before
it
the
clouds
which
had
covered
the
horizon
and
the
night
planet
poured
her
full
effulgence
upon
a
wide
and
blighted
heath
skirted
indeed
with
and
stunted
trees
in
the
quarter
from
which
they
had
come
but
open
and
bare
to
the
observation
of
the
sentinel
in
that
to
which
their
course
tended
the
wall
of
the
indeed
concealed
them
as
they
lay
but
any
advance
beyond
its
shelter
seemed
impossible
without
certain
discovery
the
highlander
eyed
the
blue
vault
but
far
from
blessing
the
useful
light
with
homer
or
rather
pope
benighted
peasant
he
muttered
a
gaelic
curse
upon
the
unseasonable
splendour
of
farlane
buat
lantern
footnote
see
note
he
looked
anxiously
around
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
apparently
took
his
resolution
leaving
his
attendant
with
waverley
after
motioning
to
edward
to
remain
quiet
and
giving
his
comrade
directions
in
a
brief
whisper
he
retreated
favoured
by
the
irregularity
of
the
ground
in
the
same
direction
and
in
the
same
manner
as
they
had
advanced
edward
turning
his
head
after
him
could
perceive
him
crawling
on
all
fours
with
the
dexterity
of
an
indian
availing
himself
of
every
bush
and
inequality
to
escape
observation
and
never
passing
over
the
more
exposed
parts
of
his
track
until
the
sentinel
back
was
turned
from
him
at
length
he
reached
the
thickets
and
underwood
which
partly
covered
the
moor
in
that
direction
and
probably
extended
to
the
verge
of
the
glen
where
waverley
had
been
so
long
an
inhabitant
the
highlander
disappeared
but
it
was
only
for
a
few
minutes
for
he
suddenly
issued
forth
from
a
different
part
of
the
thicket
and
advancing
boldly
upon
the
open
heath
as
if
to
invite
discovery
he
levelled
his
piece
and
fired
at
the
sentinel
a
wound
in
the
arm
proved
a
disagreeable
interruption
to
the
poor
fellow
meteorological
observations
as
well
as
to
the
tune
of
dawson
which
he
was
whistling
he
returned
the
fire
ineffectually
and
his
comrades
starting
up
at
the
alarm
advanced
alertly
towards
the
spot
from
which
the
first
shot
had
issued
the
highlander
after
giving
them
a
full
view
of
his
person
dived
among
the
thickets
for
his
ruse
de
guerre
had
now
perfectly
succeeded
while
the
soldiers
pursued
the
cause
of
their
disturbance
in
one
direction
waverley
adopting
the
hint
of
his
remaining
attendant
made
the
best
of
his
speed
in
that
which
his
guide
originally
intended
to
pursue
and
which
now
the
attention
of
the
soldiers
being
drawn
to
a
different
quarter
was
unobserved
and
unguarded
when
they
had
run
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
brow
of
a
rising
ground
which
they
had
surmounted
concealed
them
from
further
risk
of
observation
they
still
heard
however
at
a
distance
the
shouts
of
the
soldiers
as
they
hallooed
to
each
other
upon
the
heath
and
they
could
also
hear
the
distant
roll
of
a
drum
beating
to
arms
in
the
same
direction
but
these
hostile
sounds
were
now
far
in
their
rear
and
died
away
upon
the
breeze
as
they
rapidly
proceeded
when
they
had
walked
about
half
an
hour
still
along
open
and
waste
ground
of
the
same
description
they
came
to
the
stump
of
an
ancient
oak
which
from
its
relics
appeared
to
have
been
at
one
time
a
tree
of
very
large
size
in
an
adjacent
hollow
they
found
several
highlanders
with
a
horse
or
two
they
had
not
joined
them
above
a
few
minutes
which
waverley
attendant
employed
in
all
probability
in
communicating
the
cause
of
their
delay
for
the
words
duroch
were
often
repeated
when
duncan
himself
appeared
out
of
breath
indeed
and
with
all
the
symptoms
of
having
run
for
his
life
but
laughing
and
in
high
spirits
at
the
success
of
the
stratagem
by
which
he
had
baffled
his
pursuers
this
indeed
waverley
could
easily
conceive
might
be
a
matter
of
no
great
difficulty
to
the
active
mountaineer
who
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
ground
and
traced
his
course
with
a
firmness
and
confidence
to
which
his
pursuers
must
have
been
strangers
the
alarm
which
he
excited
seemed
still
to
continue
for
a
dropping
shot
or
two
were
heard
at
a
great
distance
which
seemed
to
serve
as
an
addition
to
the
mirth
of
duncan
and
his
comrades
the
mountaineer
now
resumed
the
arms
with
which
he
had
entrusted
our
hero
giving
him
to
understand
that
the
dangers
of
the
journey
were
happily
surmounted
waverley
was
then
mounted
upon
one
of
the
horses
a
change
which
the
fatigue
of
the
night
and
his
recent
illness
rendered
exceedingly
acceptable
his
portmanteau
was
placed
on
another
pony
duncan
mounted
a
third
and
they
set
forward
at
a
round
pace
accompanied
by
their
escort
no
other
incident
marked
the
course
of
that
night
journey
and
at
the
dawn
of
morning
they
attained
the
banks
of
a
rapid
river
the
country
around
was
at
once
fertile
and
romantic
steep
banks
of
wood
were
broken
by
which
this
year
presented
an
abundant
harvest
already
in
a
great
measure
cut
down
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
and
partly
surrounded
by
a
winding
of
its
stream
stood
a
large
and
massive
castle
the
ruined
turrets
of
which
were
already
glittering
in
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
footnote
see
note
it
was
in
form
an
oblong
square
of
size
sufficient
to
contain
a
large
court
in
the
centre
the
towers
at
each
angle
of
the
square
rose
higher
than
the
walls
of
the
building
and
were
in
their
turn
surmounted
by
turrets
differing
in
height
and
irregular
in
shape
upon
one
of
these
a
sentinel
watched
whose
bonnet
and
plaid
streaming
in
the
wind
declared
him
to
be
a
highlander
as
a
broad
white
ensign
which
floated
from
another
tower
announced
that
the
garrison
was
held
by
the
insurgent
adherents
of
the
house
of
stuart
passing
hastily
through
a
small
and
mean
town
where
their
appearance
excited
neither
surprise
nor
curiosity
in
the
few
peasants
whom
the
labours
of
the
harvest
began
to
summon
from
their
repose
the
party
crossed
an
ancient
and
narrow
bridge
of
several
arches
and
turning
to
the
left
up
an
avenue
of
huge
old
sycamores
waverley
found
himself
in
front
of
the
gloomy
yet
picturesque
structure
which
he
had
admired
at
a
distance
a
huge
door
which
formed
the
exterior
defence
of
the
gateway
was
already
thrown
back
to
receive
them
and
a
second
heavily
constructed
of
oak
and
studded
thickly
with
iron
nails
being
next
opened
admitted
them
into
the
interior
a
gentleman
dressed
in
the
highland
garb
and
having
a
white
cockade
in
his
bonnet
assisted
waverley
to
dismount
from
his
horse
and
with
much
courtesy
bid
him
welcome
to
the
castle
the
governor
for
so
we
must
term
him
having
conducted
waverley
to
a
apartment
where
however
there
was
a
small
and
having
offered
him
any
refreshment
which
he
desired
was
then
about
to
leave
him
you
not
add
to
your
civilities
said
waverley
after
having
made
the
usual
acknowledgment
having
the
kindness
to
inform
me
where
i
am
and
whether
or
not
i
am
to
consider
myself
as
a
prisoner
am
not
at
liberty
to
be
so
explicit
upon
this
subject
as
i
could
wish
briefly
however
you
are
in
the
castle
of
doune
in
the
district
of
menteith
and
in
no
danger
whatever
how
am
i
assured
of
that
the
honour
of
donald
stewart
governor
of
the
garrison
and
in
the
service
of
his
royal
highness
prince
charles
edward
so
saying
he
hastily
left
the
apartment
as
if
to
avoid
further
discussion
exhausted
by
the
fatigues
of
the
night
our
hero
now
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
and
was
in
a
few
minutes
fast
asleep
chapter
xxxix
the
journey
is
continued
before
waverley
awakened
from
his
repose
the
day
was
far
advanced
and
he
began
to
feel
that
he
had
passed
many
hours
without
food
this
was
soon
supplied
in
form
of
a
copious
breakfast
but
colonel
stewart
as
if
wishing
to
avoid
the
queries
of
his
guest
did
not
again
present
himself
his
compliments
were
however
delivered
by
a
servant
with
an
offer
to
provide
anything
in
his
power
that
could
be
useful
to
captain
waverley
on
his
journey
which
he
intimated
would
be
continued
that
evening
to
waverley
further
inquiries
the
servant
opposed
the
impenetrable
barrier
of
real
or
affected
ignorance
and
stupidity
he
removed
the
table
and
provisions
and
waverley
was
again
consigned
to
his
own
meditations
as
he
contemplated
the
strangeness
of
his
fortune
which
seemed
to
delight
in
placing
him
at
the
disposal
of
others
without
the
power
of
directing
his
own
motions
edward
eye
suddenly
rested
upon
his
portmanteau
which
had
been
deposited
in
his
apartment
during
his
sleep
the
mysterious
appearance
of
alice
in
the
cottage
of
the
glen
immediately
rushed
upon
his
mind
and
he
was
about
to
secure
and
examine
the
packet
which
she
had
deposited
among
his
clothes
when
the
servant
of
colonel
stewart
again
made
his
appearance
and
took
up
the
portmanteau
upon
his
shoulders
i
not
take
out
a
change
of
linen
my
friend
honour
sall
get
ane
o
the
colonel
ain
ruffled
sarks
but
this
maun
gang
in
the
and
so
saying
he
very
coolly
carried
off
the
portmanteau
without
waiting
further
remonstrance
leaving
our
hero
in
a
state
where
disappointment
and
indignation
struggled
for
the
mastery
in
a
few
minutes
he
heard
a
cart
rumble
out
of
the
rugged
and
made
no
doubt
that
he
was
now
dispossessed
for
a
space
at
least
if
not
for
ever
of
the
only
documents
which
seemed
to
promise
some
light
upon
the
dubious
events
which
had
of
late
influenced
his
destiny
with
such
melancholy
thoughts
he
had
to
beguile
about
four
or
five
hours
of
solitude
when
this
space
was
elapsed
the
trampling
of
horse
was
heard
in
the
and
colonel
stewart
soon
after
made
his
appearance
to
request
his
guest
to
take
some
further
refreshment
before
his
departure
the
offer
was
accepted
for
a
late
breakfast
had
by
no
means
left
our
hero
incapable
of
doing
honour
to
dinner
which
was
now
presented
the
conversation
of
his
host
was
that
of
a
plain
country
gentleman
mixed
with
some
sentiments
and
expressions
he
cautiously
avoided
any
reference
to
the
military
operations
or
civil
politics
of
the
time
and
to
waverley
direct
inquiries
concerning
some
of
these
points
replied
that
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
speak
upon
such
topics
when
dinner
was
finished
the
governor
arose
and
wishing
edward
a
good
journey
said
that
having
been
informed
by
servant
that
his
baggage
had
been
sent
forward
he
had
taken
the
freedom
to
supply
him
with
such
changes
of
linen
as
he
might
find
necessary
till
he
was
again
possessed
of
his
own
with
this
compliment
he
disappeared
a
servant
acquainted
waverley
an
instant
afterwards
that
his
horse
was
ready
upon
this
hint
he
descended
into
the
and
found
a
trooper
holding
a
saddled
horse
on
which
he
mounted
and
sallied
from
the
portal
of
doune
castle
attended
by
about
a
score
of
armed
men
on
horseback
these
had
less
the
appearance
of
regular
soldiers
than
of
individuals
who
had
suddenly
assumed
arms
from
some
pressing
motive
of
unexpected
emergency
their
uniform
which
was
blue
and
red
an
affected
imitation
of
that
of
french
chasseurs
was
in
many
respects
incomplete
and
sate
awkwardly
upon
those
who
wore
it
waverley
eye
accustomed
to
look
at
a
regiment
could
easily
discover
that
the
motions
and
habits
of
his
escort
were
not
those
of
trained
soldiers
and
that
although
expert
enough
in
the
management
of
their
horses
their
skill
was
that
of
huntsmen
or
grooms
rather
than
of
troopers
the
horses
were
not
trained
to
the
regular
pace
so
necessary
to
execute
simultaneous
and
combined
movements
and
formations
nor
did
they
seem
bitted
as
it
is
technically
expressed
for
the
use
of
the
sword
the
men
however
were
stout
fellows
and
might
be
individually
formidable
as
irregular
cavalry
the
commander
of
this
small
party
was
mounted
upon
an
excellent
hunter
and
although
dressed
in
uniform
his
change
of
apparel
did
not
prevent
waverley
from
recognising
his
old
acquaintance
falconer
of
balmawhapple
now
although
the
terms
upon
which
edward
had
parted
with
this
gentleman
were
none
of
the
most
friendly
he
would
have
sacrificed
every
recollection
of
their
foolish
quarrel
for
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
once
more
the
social
intercourse
of
question
and
answer
from
which
he
had
been
so
long
secluded
but
apparently
the
remembrance
of
his
defeat
by
the
baron
of
bradwardine
of
which
edward
had
been
the
unwilling
cause
still
rankled
in
the
mind
of
the
and
yet
proud
laird
he
carefully
avoided
giving
the
least
sign
of
recognition
riding
doggedly
at
the
head
of
his
men
who
though
scarce
equal
in
numbers
to
a
sergeant
party
were
denominated
captain
falconer
troop
being
preceded
by
a
trumpet
which
sounded
from
time
to
time
and
a
standard
borne
by
cornet
falconer
the
laird
younger
brother
the
lieutenant
an
elderly
man
had
much
the
air
of
a
low
sportsman
and
boon
companion
an
expression
of
dry
humour
predominated
in
his
countenance
over
features
of
a
vulgar
cast
which
indicated
habitual
intemperance
his
cocked
hat
was
set
knowingly
upon
one
side
of
his
head
and
while
he
whistled
the
of
dumblain
under
the
influence
of
half
a
mutchkin
of
brandy
he
seemed
to
trot
merrily
forward
with
a
happy
indifference
to
the
state
of
the
country
the
conduct
of
the
party
the
end
of
the
journey
and
all
other
sublunary
matters
whatever
from
this
wight
who
now
and
then
dropped
alongside
of
his
horse
waverley
hoped
to
acquire
some
information
or
at
least
to
beguile
the
way
with
talk
fine
evening

the

but
as
jinker
was
entered
full
sail
upon
the
pedigree
of
balmawhapple
mare
having
already
got
as
far
as
and
and
while
waverley
was
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
obtain
from
him
intelligence
of
more
interest
the
noble
captain
checked
his
horse
until
they
came
up
and
then
without
directly
appearing
to
notice
edward
said
sternly
to
the
genealogist
thought
lieutenant
my
orders
were
preceese
that
no
one
should
speak
to
the
prisoner
the
metamorphosed
was
silenced
of
course
and
slunk
to
the
rear
where
he
consoled
himself
by
entering
into
a
vehement
dispute
upon
the
price
of
hay
with
a
farmer
who
had
reluctantly
followed
his
laird
to
the
field
rather
than
give
up
his
farm
whereof
the
lease
had
just
expired
waverley
was
therefore
once
more
consigned
to
silence
foreseeing
that
further
attempts
at
conversation
with
any
of
the
party
would
only
give
balmawhapple
a
opportunity
to
display
the
insolence
of
authority
and
the
sulky
spite
of
a
temper
naturally
dogged
and
rendered
more
so
by
habits
of
low
indulgence
and
the
incense
of
servile
adulation
in
about
two
hours
time
the
party
were
near
the
castle
of
stirling
over
whose
battlements
the
union
flag
was
brightened
as
it
waved
in
the
evening
sun
to
shorten
his
journey
or
perhaps
to
display
his
importance
and
insult
the
english
garrison
balmawhapple
inclining
to
the
right
took
his
route
through
the
royal
park
which
reaches
to
and
surrounds
the
rock
upon
which
the
fortress
is
situated
with
a
mind
more
at
ease
waverley
could
not
have
failed
to
admire
the
mixture
of
romance
and
beauty
which
renders
interesting
the
scene
through
which
he
was
now
passing
the
field
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
tournaments
of
old
the
rock
from
which
the
ladies
beheld
the
contest
while
each
made
vows
for
the
success
of
some
favourite
knight
the
towers
of
the
gothic
church
where
these
vows
might
be
paid
and
surmounting
all
the
fortress
itself
at
once
a
castle
and
palace
where
valour
received
the
prize
from
royalty
and
knights
and
dames
closed
the
evening
amid
the
revelry
of
the
dance
the
song
and
the
feast
all
these
were
objects
fitted
to
arouse
and
interest
a
romantic
imagination
but
waverley
had
other
objects
of
meditation
and
an
incident
soon
occurred
of
a
nature
to
disturb
meditation
of
any
kind
balmawhapple
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
as
he
wheeled
his
little
body
of
cavalry
round
the
base
of
the
castle
commanded
his
trumpet
to
sound
a
flourish
and
his
standard
to
be
displayed
this
insult
produced
apparently
some
sensation
for
when
the
cavalcade
was
at
such
distance
from
the
southern
battery
as
to
admit
of
a
gun
being
depressed
so
as
to
bear
upon
them
a
flash
of
fire
issued
from
one
of
the
embrazures
upon
the
rock
and
ere
the
report
with
which
it
was
attended
could
be
heard
the
rushing
sound
of
a
passed
over
balmawhapple
head
and
the
bullet
burying
itself
in
the
ground
at
a
few
yards
distance
covered
him
with
the
earth
which
it
drove
up
there
was
no
need
to
bid
the
party
trudge
in
fact
every
man
acting
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
soon
brought
jinker
steeds
to
show
their
mettle
and
the
cavaliers
retreating
with
more
speed
than
regularity
never
took
to
a
trot
as
the
lieutenant
afterwards
observed
until
an
intervening
eminence
had
secured
them
from
any
repetition
of
so
undesirable
a
compliment
on
the
part
of
stirling
castle
i
must
do
balmawhapple
however
the
justice
to
say
that
he
not
only
kept
the
rear
of
his
troop
and
laboured
to
maintain
some
order
among
them
but
in
the
height
of
his
gallantry
answered
the
fire
of
the
castle
by
discharging
one
of
his
pistols
at
the
battlements
although
the
distance
being
nearly
half
a
mile
i
could
never
learn
that
this
measure
of
retaliation
was
attended
with
any
particular
effect
the
travellers
now
passed
the
memorable
field
of
bannockburn
and
reached
the
torwood
a
place
glorious
or
terrible
to
the
recollections
of
the
scottish
peasant
as
the
feats
of
wallace
or
the
cruelties
of
wude
willie
grime
predominate
in
his
recollection
at
falkirk
a
town
formerly
famous
in
scottish
history
and
soon
to
be
again
distinguished
as
the
scene
of
military
events
of
importance
balmawhapple
proposed
to
halt
and
repose
for
the
evening
this
was
performed
with
very
little
regard
to
military
discipline
his
worthy
being
chiefly
solicitous
to
discover
where
the
best
brandy
might
be
come
at
sentinels
were
deemed
unnecessary
and
the
only
vigils
performed
were
those
of
such
of
the
party
as
could
procure
liquor
a
few
resolute
men
might
easily
have
cut
off
the
detachment
but
of
the
inhabitants
some
were
favourable
many
indifferent
and
the
rest
overawed
so
nothing
memorable
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
evening
except
that
waverley
rest
was
sorely
interrupted
by
the
revellers
hallooing
forth
their
jacobite
songs
without
remorse
or
mitigation
of
voice
early
in
the
morning
they
were
again
mounted
and
on
the
road
to
edinburgh
though
the
pallid
visages
of
some
of
the
troop
betrayed
that
they
had
spent
a
night
of
sleepless
debauchery
they
halted
at
linlithgow
distinguished
by
its
ancient
palace
which
sixty
years
since
was
entire
and
habitable
and
whose
venerable
ruins
not
quite
sixty
years
since
very
narrowly
escaped
the
unworthy
fate
of
being
converted
into
a
barrack
for
french
prisoners
may
repose
and
blessings
attend
the
ashes
of
the
patriotic
statesman
who
amongst
his
last
services
to
scotland
interposed
to
prevent
this
profanation
as
they
approached
the
metropolis
of
scotland
through
a
champaign
and
cultivated
country
the
sounds
of
war
began
to
be
heard
the
distant
yet
distinct
report
of
heavy
cannon
fired
at
intervals
apprized
waverley
that
the
work
of
destruction
was
going
forward
even
balmawhapple
seemed
moved
to
take
some
precautions
by
sending
an
advanced
party
in
front
of
his
troop
keeping
the
main
body
in
tolerable
order
and
moving
steadily
forward
marching
in
this
manner
they
speedily
reached
an
eminence
from
which
they
could
view
edinburgh
stretching
along
the
ridgy
hill
which
slopes
eastward
from
the
castle
the
latter
being
in
a
state
of
siege
or
rather
of
blockade
by
the
northern
insurgents
who
had
already
occupied
the
town
for
two
or
three
days
fired
at
intervals
upon
such
parties
of
highlanders
as
exposed
themselves
either
on
the
main
street
or
elsewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fortress
the
morning
being
calm
and
fair
the
effect
of
this
dropping
fire
was
to
invest
the
castle
in
wreaths
of
smoke
the
edges
of
which
dissipated
slowly
in
the
air
while
the
central
veil
was
darkened
ever
and
anon
by
fresh
clouds
poured
forth
from
the
battlements
the
whole
giving
by
the
partial
concealment
an
appearance
of
grandeur
and
gloom
rendered
more
terrific
when
waverley
reflected
on
the
cause
by
which
it
was
produced
and
that
each
explosion
might
ring
some
brave
man
knell
ere
they
approached
the
city
the
partial
cannonade
had
wholly
ceased
balmawhapple
however
having
in
his
recollection
the
unfriendly
greeting
which
his
troop
had
received
from
the
battery
at
stirling
had
apparently
no
wish
to
tempt
the
forbearance
of
the
artillery
of
the
castle
he
therefore
left
the
direct
road
and
sweeping
considerably
to
the
southward
so
as
to
keep
out
of
the
range
of
the
cannon
approached
the
ancient
palace
of
holyrood
without
having
entered
the
walls
of
the
city
he
then
drew
up
his
men
in
front
of
that
venerable
pile
and
delivered
waverley
to
the
custody
of
a
guard
of
highlanders
whose
officer
conducted
him
into
the
interior
of
the
building
a
long
low
and
gallery
hung
with
pictures
affirmed
to
be
the
portraits
of
kings
who
if
they
ever
flourished
at
all
lived
several
hundred
years
before
the
invention
of
painting
in
oil
colours
served
as
a
sort
of
guard
chamber
or
vestibule
to
the
apartments
which
the
adventurous
charles
edward
now
occupied
in
the
palace
of
his
ancestors
officers
both
in
the
highland
and
lowland
garb
passed
and
repassed
in
haste
or
loitered
in
the
hall
as
if
waiting
for
orders
secretaries
were
engaged
in
making
out
passes
musters
and
returns
all
seemed
busy
and
earnestly
intent
upon
something
of
importance
but
waverley
was
suffered
to
remain
seated
in
the
recess
of
a
window
unnoticed
by
any
one
in
anxious
reflection
upon
the
crisis
of
his
fate
which
seemed
now
rapidly
approaching
chapter
xl
an
old
and
a
new
acquaintance
while
he
was
deep
sunk
in
his
reverie
the
rustle
of
tartans
was
heard
behind
him
a
friendly
arm
clasped
his
shoulders
and
a
friendly
voice
exclaimed
the
highland
prophet
sooth
or
must
go
for
nothing
waverley
turned
and
was
warmly
embraced
by
fergus
thousand
welcomes
to
holyrood
once
more
possessed
by
her
legitimate
sovereign
did
i
not
say
we
should
prosper
and
that
you
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
if
you
parted
from
us
fergus
said
waverley
eagerly
returning
his
greeting
is
long
since
i
have
heard
a
friend
voice
where
is
flora
and
a
triumphant
spectator
of
our
success
this
place
said
waverley
in
this
city
at
least
answered
his
friend
you
shall
see
her
but
first
you
must
meet
a
friend
whom
you
little
think
of
who
has
been
frequent
in
his
inquiries
after
you
thus
saying
he
dragged
waverley
by
the
arm
out
of
the
guard
chamber
and
ere
he
knew
where
he
was
conducted
edward
found
himself
in
a
presence
room
fitted
up
with
some
attempt
at
royal
state
a
young
man
wearing
his
own
fair
hair
distinguished
by
the
dignity
of
his
mien
and
the
noble
expression
of
his
and
regular
features
advanced
out
of
a
circle
of
military
gentlemen
and
highland
chiefs
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
in
his
easy
and
graceful
manners
waverley
afterwards
thought
he
could
have
discovered
his
high
birth
and
rank
although
the
star
on
his
breast
and
the
embroidered
garter
at
his
knee
had
not
appeared
as
its
indications
me
present
to
your
royal
highness
said
fergus
bowing
profoundly
descendant
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
loyal
families
in
england
said
the
young
chevalier
interrupting
him
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
you
my
dear
but
no
master
of
ceremonies
is
necessary
to
present
a
waverley
to
a
stuart
thus
saying
he
extended
his
hand
to
edward
with
the
utmost
courtesy
who
could
not
had
he
desired
it
have
avoided
rendering
him
the
homage
which
seemed
due
to
his
rank
and
was
certainly
the
right
of
his
birth
am
sorry
to
understand
waverley
that
owing
to
circumstances
which
have
been
as
yet
but
ill
explained
you
have
suffered
some
restraint
among
my
followers
in
perthshire
and
on
your
march
here
but
we
are
in
such
a
situation
that
we
hardly
know
our
friends
and
i
am
even
at
this
moment
uncertain
whether
i
can
have
the
pleasure
of
considering
waverley
as
among
mine
he
then
paused
for
an
instant
but
before
edward
could
adjust
a
suitable
reply
or
even
arrange
his
ideas
as
to
its
purport
the
prince
took
out
a
paper
and
then
proceeded
should
indeed
have
no
doubts
upon
this
subject
if
i
could
trust
to
this
proclamation
set
forth
by
the
friends
of
the
elector
of
hanover
in
which
they
rank
waverley
among
the
nobility
and
gentry
who
are
menaced
with
the
pains
of
for
loyalty
to
their
legitimate
sovereign
but
i
desire
to
gain
no
adherents
save
from
affection
and
conviction
and
if
waverley
inclines
to
prosecute
his
journey
to
the
south
or
to
join
the
forces
of
the
elector
he
shall
have
my
passport
and
free
permission
to
do
so
and
i
can
only
regret
that
my
present
power
will
not
extend
to
protect
him
against
the
probable
consequences
of
such
a
measure
but
continued
charles
edward
after
another
short
pause
waverley
should
like
his
ancestor
sir
nigel
determine
to
embrace
a
cause
which
has
little
to
recommend
it
but
its
justice
and
follow
a
prince
who
throws
himself
upon
the
affections
of
his
people
to
recover
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
or
perish
in
the
attempt
i
can
only
say
that
among
these
nobles
and
gentlemen
he
will
find
worthy
associates
in
a
gallant
enterprise
and
will
follow
a
master
who
may
be
unfortunate
but
i
trust
will
never
be
ungrateful
the
politic
chieftain
of
the
race
of
ivor
knew
his
advantage
in
introducing
waverley
to
this
personal
interview
with
the
royal
adventurer
unaccustomed
to
the
address
and
manners
of
a
polished
court
in
which
charles
was
eminently
skilful
his
words
and
his
kindness
penetrated
the
heart
of
our
hero
and
easily
outweighed
all
prudential
motives
to
be
thus
personally
solicited
for
assistance
by
a
prince
whose
form
and
manners
as
well
as
the
spirit
which
he
displayed
in
this
singular
enterprise
answered
his
ideas
of
a
hero
of
romance
to
be
courted
by
him
in
the
ancient
halls
of
his
paternal
palace
recovered
by
the
sword
which
he
was
already
bending
towards
other
conquests
gave
edward
in
his
own
eyes
the
dignity
and
importance
which
he
had
ceased
to
consider
as
his
attributes
rejected
slandered
and
threatened
upon
the
one
side
he
was
irresistibly
attracted
to
the
cause
which
the
prejudices
of
education
and
the
political
principles
of
his
family
had
already
recommended
as
the
most
just
these
thoughts
rushed
through
his
mind
like
a
torrent
sweeping
before
them
every
consideration
of
an
opposite
tendency
the
time
besides
admitted
of
no
deliberation
and
waverley
kneeling
to
charles
edward
devoted
his
heart
and
sword
to
the
vindication
of
his
rights
the
prince
for
although
unfortunate
in
the
faults
and
follies
of
his
forefathers
we
shall
here
and
elsewhere
give
him
the
title
due
to
his
birth
raised
waverley
from
the
ground
and
embraced
him
with
an
expression
of
thanks
too
warm
not
to
be
genuine
he
also
thanked
fergus
repeatedly
for
having
brought
him
such
an
adherent
and
presented
waverley
to
the
various
noblemen
chieftains
and
officers
who
were
about
his
person
as
a
young
gentleman
of
the
highest
hopes
and
prospects
in
whose
bold
and
enthusiastic
avowal
of
his
cause
they
might
see
an
evidence
of
the
sentiments
of
the
english
families
of
rank
at
this
important
crisis
footnote
see
note
indeed
this
was
a
point
much
doubted
among
the
adherents
of
the
house
of
stuart
and
as
a
founded
disbelief
in
the
cooperation
of
the
english
jacobites
kept
many
scottish
men
of
rank
from
his
standard
and
diminished
the
courage
of
those
who
had
joined
it
nothing
could
be
more
seasonable
for
the
chevalier
than
the
open
declaration
in
his
favour
of
the
representative
of
the
house
of
so
long
known
as
cavaliers
and
royalists
this
fergus
had
foreseen
from
the
beginning
he
really
loved
waverley
because
their
feelings
and
projects
never
thwarted
each
other
he
hoped
to
see
him
united
with
flora
and
he
rejoiced
that
they
were
effectually
engaged
in
the
same
cause
but
as
we
before
hinted
he
also
exulted
as
a
politician
in
beholding
secured
to
his
party
a
partizan
of
such
consequence
and
he
was
far
from
being
insensible
to
the
personal
importance
which
he
himself
gained
with
the
prince
from
having
so
materially
assisted
in
making
the
acquisition
charles
edward
on
his
part
seemed
eager
to
show
his
attendants
the
value
which
he
attached
to
his
new
adherent
by
entering
immediately
as
in
confidence
upon
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
have
been
secluded
so
much
from
intelligence
waverley
from
causes
of
which
i
am
but
indistinctly
informed
that
i
presume
you
are
even
yet
unacquainted
with
the
important
particulars
of
my
present
situation
you
have
however
heard
of
my
landing
in
the
remote
district
of
moidart
with
only
seven
attendants
and
of
the
numerous
chiefs
and
clans
whose
loyal
enthusiasm
at
once
placed
a
solitary
adventurer
at
the
head
of
a
gallant
army
you
must
also
i
think
have
learned
that
the
of
the
hanoverian
elector
sir
john
cope
marched
into
the
highlands
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
and
appointed
military
force
with
the
intention
of
giving
us
battle
but
that
his
courage
failed
him
when
we
were
within
three
march
of
each
other
so
that
he
fairly
gave
us
the
slip
and
marched
northward
to
aberdeen
leaving
the
low
country
open
and
undefended
not
to
lose
so
favourable
an
opportunity
i
marched
on
to
this
metropolis
driving
before
me
two
regiments
of
horse
gardiner
and
hamilton
who
had
threatened
to
cut
to
pieces
every
highlander
that
should
venture
to
pass
stirling
and
while
discussions
were
carrying
forward
among
the
magistracy
and
citizens
of
edinburgh
whether
they
should
defend
themselves
or
surrender
my
good
friend
lochiel
laying
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
that
gallant
and
accomplished
chieftain
saved
them
the
trouble
of
farther
deliberation
by
entering
the
gates
with
five
hundred
camerons
thus
far
therefore
we
have
done
well
but
in
the
meanwhile
this
doughty
general
nerves
being
braced
by
the
keen
air
of
aberdeen
he
has
taken
shipping
for
dunbar
and
i
have
just
received
certain
information
that
he
landed
there
yesterday
his
purpose
must
unquestionably
be
to
march
towards
us
to
recover
possession
of
the
capital
now
there
are
two
opinions
in
my
council
of
war
one
that
being
inferior
probably
in
numbers
and
certainly
in
discipline
and
military
appointments
not
to
mention
our
total
want
of
artillery
and
the
weakness
of
our
cavalry
it
will
be
safest
to
fall
back
towards
the
mountains
and
there
protract
the
war
until
fresh
succours
arrive
from
france
and
the
whole
body
of
the
highland
clans
shall
have
taken
arms
in
our
favour
the
opposite
opinion
maintains
that
a
retrograde
movement
in
our
circumstances
is
certain
to
throw
utter
discredit
on
our
arms
and
undertaking
and
far
from
gaining
us
new
partizans
will
be
the
means
of
disheartening
those
who
have
joined
our
standard
the
officers
who
use
these
last
arguments
among
whom
is
your
friend
fergus
maintain
that
if
the
highlanders
are
strangers
to
the
usual
military
discipline
of
europe
the
soldiers
whom
they
are
to
encounter
are
no
less
strangers
to
their
peculiar
and
formidable
mode
of
attack
that
the
attachment
and
courage
of
the
chiefs
and
gentlemen
are
not
to
be
doubted
and
that
as
they
will
be
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
their
clansmen
will
as
surely
follow
them
in
fine
that
having
drawn
the
sword
we
should
throw
away
the
scabbard
and
trust
our
cause
to
battle
and
to
the
god
of
battles
will
waverley
favour
us
with
his
opinion
in
these
arduous
circumstances
waverley
coloured
high
betwixt
pleasure
and
modesty
at
the
distinction
implied
in
this
question
and
answered
with
equal
spirit
and
readiness
that
he
could
not
venture
to
offer
an
opinion
as
derived
from
military
skill
but
that
the
counsel
would
be
far
the
most
acceptable
to
him
which
should
first
afford
him
an
opportunity
to
evince
his
zeal
in
his
royal
highness
service
like
a
waverley
answered
charles
edward
that
you
may
hold
a
rank
in
some
degree
corresponding
to
your
name
allow
me
instead
of
the
captain
commission
which
you
have
lost
to
offer
you
the
brevet
rank
of
major
in
my
service
with
the
advantage
of
acting
as
one
of
my
until
you
can
be
attached
to
a
regiment
of
which
i
hope
several
will
be
speedily
embodied
royal
highness
will
forgive
me
answered
waverley
for
his
recollection
turned
to
balmawhapple
and
his
scanty
troop
i
decline
accepting
any
rank
until
the
time
and
place
where
i
may
have
interest
enough
to
raise
a
sufficient
body
of
men
to
make
my
command
useful
to
your
royal
highness
service
in
the
meanwhile
i
hope
for
your
permission
to
serve
as
a
volunteer
under
my
friend
fergus
least
said
the
prince
who
was
obviously
pleased
with
this
proposal
me
the
pleasure
of
arming
you
after
the
highland
fashion
with
these
words
he
unbuckled
the
broadsword
which
he
wore
the
belt
of
which
was
plaited
with
silver
and
the
steel
richly
and
curiously
inlaid
blade
said
the
prince
a
genuine
andrea
ferrara
it
has
been
a
sort
of
loom
in
our
family
but
i
am
convinced
i
put
it
into
better
hands
than
my
own
and
will
add
to
it
pistols
of
the
same
workmanship
colonel
you
must
have
much
to
say
to
your
friend
i
will
detain
you
no
longer
from
your
private
conversation
but
remember
we
expect
you
both
to
attend
us
in
the
evening
it
may
be
perhaps
the
last
night
we
may
enjoy
in
these
halls
and
as
we
go
to
the
field
with
a
clear
conscience
we
will
spend
the
eve
of
battle
merrily
thus
licensed
the
chief
and
waverley
left
the
chapter
xli
the
mystery
begins
to
be
cleared
up
do
you
like
him
was
fergus
first
question
as
they
descended
the
large
stone
staircase
prince
to
live
and
die
under
was
waverley
enthusiastic
answer
knew
you
would
think
so
when
you
saw
him
and
i
intended
you
should
have
met
earlier
but
was
prevented
by
your
sprain
and
yet
he
has
his
foibles
or
rather
he
has
difficult
cards
to
play
and
his
irish
officers
footnote
see
note
who
are
much
about
him
are
but
sorry
advisers
they
can
not
discriminate
among
the
numerous
pretensions
that
are
set
up
would
you
think
it
i
have
been
obliged
for
the
present
to
suppress
an
earl
patent
granted
for
services
rendered
ten
years
ago
for
fear
of
exciting
the
jealousy
forsooth
of
c
and
m
but
you
were
very
right
edward
to
refuse
the
situation
of
there
are
two
vacant
indeed
but
clanronald
and
lochiel
and
almost
all
of
us
have
requested
one
for
young
aberchallader
and
the
lowlanders
and
the
irish
party
are
equally
desirous
to
have
the
other
for
the
master
of
f
now
if
either
of
these
candidates
were
to
be
superseded
in
your
favour
you
would
make
enemies
and
then
i
am
surprised
that
the
prince
should
have
offered
you
a
majority
when
he
knows
very
well
that
nothing
short
of
will
satisfy
others
who
can
not
bring
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
to
the
field
but
patience
cousin
and
shuffle
the
cards
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
present
and
we
must
have
you
properly
equipped
for
the
evening
in
your
new
costume
for
to
say
truth
your
outward
man
is
scarce
fit
for
a
court
said
waverley
looking
at
his
soiled
dress
shooting
jacket
has
seen
service
since
we
parted
but
that
probably
you
my
friend
know
as
well
or
better
than
i
do
my
too
much
honour
said
fergus
were
so
busy
first
with
the
scheme
of
giving
battle
to
cope
and
afterwards
with
our
operations
in
the
lowlands
that
i
could
only
give
general
directions
to
such
of
our
people
as
were
left
in
perthshire
to
respect
and
protect
you
should
you
come
in
their
way
but
let
me
hear
the
full
story
of
your
adventures
for
they
have
reached
us
in
a
very
partial
and
mutilated
manner
waverley
then
detailed
at
length
the
circumstances
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
to
which
fergus
listened
with
great
attention
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
door
of
his
quarters
which
he
had
taken
up
in
a
small
paved
court
retiring
from
the
street
called
the
canongate
at
the
house
of
a
buxom
widow
of
forty
who
seemed
to
smile
very
graciously
upon
the
handsome
young
chief
she
being
a
person
with
whom
good
looks
and
were
sure
to
secure
an
interest
whatever
might
be
the
political
opinions
here
callum
beg
received
them
with
a
smile
of
recognition

chief

a

of

then
my
dear
edward
turning
to
him
you
will
be
a
complete
son
of
ivor
these
necessary
directions
given
the
chieftain
resumed
the
subject
of
waverley
adventures
is
plain
he
said
you
have
been
in
the
custody
of
donald
bean
lean
you
must
know
that
when
i
marched
away
my
clan
to
join
the
prince
i
laid
my
injunctions
on
that
worthy
member
of
society
to
perform
a
certain
piece
of
service
which
done
he
was
to
join
me
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
but
instead
of
doing
so
the
gentleman
finding
the
coast
clear
thought
it
better
to
make
war
on
his
own
account
and
has
scoured
the
country
plundering
i
believe
both
friend
and
foe
under
pretence
of
levying
blackmail
sometimes
as
if
by
my
authority
and
sometimes
and
be
cursed
to
his
consummate
impudence
in
his
own
great
name
upon
my
honour
if
i
live
to
see
the
cairn
of
benmore
again
i
shall
be
tempted
to
hang
that
fellow
i
recognise
his
hand
particularly
in
the
mode
of
your
rescue
from
that
canting
rascal
gilfillan
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
donald
himself
played
the
part
of
the
pedlar
on
that
occasion
but
how
he
should
not
have
plundered
you
or
put
you
to
ransom
or
availed
himself
in
some
way
or
other
of
your
captivity
for
his
own
advantage
passes
my
judgment
and
how
did
you
hear
the
intelligence
of
my
confinement
asked
waverley
prince
himself
told
me
said
fergus
inquired
very
minutely
into
your
history
he
then
mentioned
your
being
at
that
moment
in
the
power
of
one
of
our
northern
parties
you
know
i
could
not
ask
him
to
explain
particulars
and
requested
my
opinion
about
disposing
of
you
i
recommended
that
you
should
be
brought
here
as
a
prisoner
because
i
did
not
wish
to
prejudice
you
farther
with
the
english
government
in
case
you
pursued
your
purpose
of
going
southward
i
knew
nothing
you
must
recollect
of
the
charge
brought
against
you
of
aiding
and
abetting
high
treason
which
i
presume
had
some
share
in
changing
your
original
plan
that
sullen
brute
balmawhapple
was
sent
to
escort
you
from
doune
with
what
he
calls
his
troop
of
horse
as
to
his
behaviour
in
addition
to
his
natural
antipathy
to
everything
that
resembles
a
gentleman
i
presume
his
adventure
with
bradwardine
rankles
in
his
recollection
the
rather
that
i
daresay
his
mode
of
telling
that
story
contributed
to
the
evil
reports
which
reached
your
quondam
regiment
likely
said
waverley
now
surely
my
dear
fergus
you
may
find
time
to
tell
me
something
of
flora
replied
fergus
can
only
tell
you
that
she
is
well
and
residing
for
the
present
with
a
relation
in
this
city
i
thought
it
better
she
should
come
here
as
since
our
success
a
good
many
ladies
of
rank
attend
our
military
court
and
i
assure
you
that
there
is
a
sort
of
consequence
annexed
to
the
near
relative
of
such
a
person
as
flora
and
where
there
is
such
a
justling
of
claims
and
requests
a
man
must
use
every
fair
means
to
enhance
his
importance
there
was
something
in
this
last
sentence
which
grated
on
waverley
feelings
he
could
not
bear
that
flora
should
be
considered
as
conducing
to
her
brother
preferment
by
the
admiration
which
she
must
unquestionably
attract
and
although
it
was
in
strict
correspondence
with
many
points
of
character
it
shocked
him
as
selfish
and
unworthy
of
his
high
mind
and
his
own
independent
pride
fergus
to
whom
such
manoeuvres
were
familiar
as
to
one
brought
up
at
the
french
court
did
not
observe
the
unfavourable
impression
which
he
had
unwarily
made
upon
his
friend
mind
and
concluded
by
saying
that
they
could
hardly
see
flora
before
the
evening
when
she
would
be
at
the
concert
and
ball
with
which
the
prince
party
were
to
be
entertained
she
and
i
had
a
quarrel
about
her
not
appearing
to
take
leave
of
you
i
am
unwilling
to
renew
it
by
soliciting
her
to
receive
you
this
morning
and
perhaps
my
doing
so
might
not
only
be
ineffectual
but
prevent
your
meeting
this
evening
while
thus
conversing
waverley
heard
in
the
court
before
the
windows
of
the
parlour
a
voice
aver
to
you
my
worthy
friend
said
the
speaker
it
is
a
total
dereliction
of
military
discipline
and
were
you
not
as
it
were
a
tyro
your
purpose
would
deserve
strong
reprobation
for
a
prisoner
of
war
is
on
no
account
to
be
coerced
with
fetters
or
debinded
in
ergastulo
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
you
put
this
gentleman
into
the
pit
of
the
at
balmawhapple
i
grant
indeed
that
such
a
prisoner
may
for
security
be
coerced
in
carcere
that
is
in
a
public
prison
the
growling
voice
of
balmawhapple
was
heard
as
taking
leave
in
displeasure
but
the
word
alone
was
distinctly
audible
he
had
disappeared
before
waverley
reached
the
house
in
order
to
greet
the
worthy
baron
of
bradwardine
the
uniform
in
which
he
was
now
attired
a
blue
coat
namely
with
gold
lace
a
scarlet
waistcoat
and
breeches
and
immense
seemed
to
have
added
fresh
stiffness
and
rigidity
to
his
tall
perpendicular
figure
and
the
consciousness
of
military
command
and
authority
had
increased
in
the
same
proportion
the
of
his
demeanour
and
the
dogmatism
of
his
conversation
he
received
waverley
with
his
usual
kindness
and
expressed
immediate
anxiety
to
hear
an
explanation
of
the
circumstances
attending
the
loss
of
his
commission
in
gardiner
dragoons
he
said
he
had
the
least
apprehension
of
his
young
friend
having
done
aught
which
could
merit
such
ungenerous
treatment
as
he
had
received
from
government
but
because
it
was
right
and
seemly
that
the
baron
of
bradwardine
should
be
in
point
of
trust
and
in
point
of
power
fully
able
to
refute
all
calumnies
against
the
heir
of
whom
he
had
so
much
right
to
regard
as
his
own
son
fergus
who
had
now
joined
them
went
hastily
over
the
circumstances
of
waverley
story
and
concluded
with
the
flattering
reception
he
had
met
from
the
young
chevalier
the
baron
listened
in
silence
and
at
the
conclusion
shook
waverley
heartily
by
the
hand
and
congratulated
him
upon
entering
the
service
of
his
lawful
prince
continued
he
it
has
been
justly
held
in
all
nations
a
matter
of
scandal
and
dishonour
to
infringe
the
sacramentum
militare
and
that
whether
it
was
taken
by
each
soldier
singly
whilk
the
romans
denominated
per
conjurationem
or
by
one
soldier
in
name
of
the
rest
yet
no
one
ever
doubted
that
the
allegiance
so
sworn
was
discharged
by
the
dimissio
or
discharging
of
a
soldier
whose
case
would
be
as
hard
as
that
of
colliers
salters
and
other
adscripti
glebes
or
slaves
of
the
soil
were
it
to
be
accounted
otherwise
this
is
something
like
the
brocard
expressed
by
the
learned
sanchez
in
his
work
de
which
you
have
questionless
consulted
upon
this
occasion
as
for
those
who
have
calumniated
you
by
making
i
protest
to
heaven
i
think
they
have
justly
incurred
the
penalty
of
the
memnonia
lex
also
called
lex
rhemnia
which
is
prelected
upon
by
tullius
in
his
oration
in
verrem
i
should
have
deemed
however
waverley
that
before
destining
yourself
to
any
special
service
in
the
army
of
the
prince
ye
might
have
inquired
what
rank
the
old
bradwardine
held
there
and
whether
he
would
not
have
been
peculiarly
happy
to
have
had
your
services
in
the
regiment
of
horse
which
he
is
now
about
to
levy
edward
eluded
this
reproach
by
pleading
the
necessity
of
giving
an
immediate
answer
to
the
prince
proposal
and
his
uncertainty
at
the
moment
whether
his
friend
the
baron
was
with
the
army
or
engaged
upon
service
elsewhere
this
punctilio
being
settled
waverley
made
inquiry
after
miss
bradwardine
and
was
informed
she
had
come
to
edinburgh
with
flora
under
guard
of
a
party
of
the
chieftain
men
this
step
was
indeed
necessary
having
become
a
very
unpleasant
and
even
dangerous
place
of
residence
for
an
unprotected
young
lady
on
account
of
its
vicinity
to
the
highlands
and
also
to
one
or
two
large
villages
which
from
aversion
as
much
to
the
caterans
as
zeal
for
presbytery
had
declared
themselves
on
the
side
of
government
and
formed
irregular
bodies
of
partizans
who
had
frequent
skirmishes
with
the
mountaineers
and
sometimes
attacked
the
houses
of
the
jacobite
gentry
in
the
braes
or
frontier
betwixt
the
mountain
and
plain
would
propose
to
you
continued
the
baron
walk
as
far
as
my
quarters
in
the
luckenbooths
and
to
admire
in
your
passage
the
high
street
whilk
is
beyond
a
shadow
of
dubitation
finer
than
any
street
whether
in
london
or
paris
but
rose
poor
thing
is
sorely
discomposed
with
the
firing
of
the
castle
though
i
have
proved
to
her
from
blondel
and
coehorn
that
it
is
impossible
a
bullet
can
reach
these
buildings
and
besides
i
have
it
in
charge
from
his
royal
highness
to
go
to
the
camp
or
leaguer
of
our
army
to
see
that
the
men
do
condamare
vasa
that
is
truss

not

it
is
unspeakable
the
quantity
of
useless
sprechery
which
they
have
collected
on

i

one

craving

once
more

come
my

you
know
as
well
as
i
that
a
hundred
uhlans
or
a

troop
of
schmirschitz

would
make
more
havoc
in

a
soldier
dinner
james
of
the
needle
was
a
man
of
his
word
when
whisky
was
no
party
to
the
contract
and
upon
this
occasion
callum
beg
who
still
thought
himself
in
waverley
debt
since
he
had
declined
accepting
compensation
at
the
expense
of
mine
host
of
the
candlestick
person
took
the
opportunity
of
discharging
the
obligation
by
mounting
guard
over
the
hereditary
tailor
of
sliochd
nan
ivor
and
as
he
expressed
himself
him
tightly
till
the
finishing
of
the
job
to
rid
himself
of
this
restraint
shemus
needle
flew
through
the
tartan
like
lightning
and
as
the
artist
kept
chanting
some
dreadful
skirmish
of
fin
macoul
he
accomplished
at
least
three
stitches
to
the
death
of
every
hero
the
dress
was
therefore
soon
ready
for
the
short
coat
fitted
the
wearer
and
the
rest
of
the
apparel
required
little
adjustment
our
hero
having
now
fairly
assumed
the
of
old
gaul
well
calculated
as
it
was
to
give
an
appearance
of
strength
to
a
figure
which
though
tall
and
was
rather
elegant
than
robust
i
hope
my
fair
readers
will
excuse
him
if
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
more
than
once
and
could
not
help
acknowledging
that
the
reflection
seemed
that
of
a
very
handsome
young
fellow
in
fact
there
was
no
disguising
it
his
hair
for
he
wore
no
periwig
notwithstanding
the
universal
fashion
of
the
time
became
the
bonnet
which
surmounted
it
his
person
promised
firmness
and
agility
to
which
the
ample
folds
of
the
tartan
added
an
air
of
dignity
his
blue
eye
seemed
of
that
kind
which
melted
in
love
and
which
kindled
in
war
and
an
air
of
bashfulness
which
was
in
reality
the
effect
of
want
of
habitual
intercourse
with
the
world
gave
interest
to
his
features
without
injuring
their
grace

intelligence

flockhart
smiling

took

within

perhaps
that
she
cared
not
how
long
the
rebellion
lasted
that
brought
her
into
company
so
much
above
her
usual
associates
she
was
supported
by
waverley
and
the
baron
with
the
advantage
of
the
chieftain
the
men
of
peace
and
of

that

after

fergus
spirits
were
extravagantly
high
regardless
of
danger
and
sanguine
from

youth
and
ambition
he
saw
in
imagination
all
his
prospects
crowned
with
success
and
was
totally
indifferent
to
the
probable
alternative
of
a
soldier
grave
the
baron
apologized
slightly
for
bringing
macwheeble
they
had
been
providing
he
said

of

the

shifted

fidgeted
about
in

appeared
extremely
uneasy
at

preliminary

much
tautological

of

there
was

doubtless
if
his

though
he
felt
as
if
condemned
to
suffer
a
transfusion
of
blood
from
his
own
veins
into
those
of
the
baron
did
not
presume
to
make
any
reply
after
fidgeting
a
little
while
longer
however
he
addressed
himself
to
glennaquoich
and
told
him
if
his
honour
had
mair
ready
siller
than
was
sufficient
for
his
occasions
in

he
could
put
it
out
at

for
his

in
safe
hands
and
at
great
profit
at
this
time
at
this
proposal
fergus
laughed
heartily
and
answered
when
he
had
recovered
his
breath

but
she
away
with
duncan
grame
and
he
row
her
in
his
plaidy
by
this
time
they
reached
the
palace
of
holyrood
and
were
announced
respectively
as
they
entered
the
apartments
it
is
but
too
well
known
how
many
gentlemen
of
rank
education
and
fortune
took
a
concern
in
the
and
desperate
undertaking
of
the
ladies
also
of
scotland
very
generally
espoused
the
cause
of
the
gallant
and
handsome
young
prince
who
threw
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
his
countrymen
rather
like
a
hero
of
romance
than
a
calculating
politician
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
wondered
that
edward
who
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
the
solemn
seclusion
of
should
have
been
dazzled
at
the
liveliness
and
elegance
of
the
scene
now
exhibited
in
the
long
deserted
halls
of
the
scottish
palace
the
accompaniments
indeed
fell
short
of
splendour
being
such
as
the
confusion
and
hurry
of
the
time
admitted
still
however
the
general
effect
was
striking
and
the
rank
of
the
company
considered
might
well
be
called
brilliant
it
was
not
long
before
the
lover
eye
discovered
the
object
of
his
attachment
flora
was
in
the
act
of
returning
to
her
seat
near
the
top
of
the
room
with
rose
bradwardine
by
her
side
among
much
elegance
and
beauty
they
had
attracted
a
great
degree
of
the
public
attention
being
certainly
two
of
the
handsomest
women
present
the
prince
took
much
notice
of
both
particularly
of
flora
with
whom
he
danced
a
preference
which
she
probably
owed
to
her
foreign
education
and
command
of
the
french
and
italian
languages
when
the
bustle
attending
the
conclusion
of
the
dance
permitted
edward
almost
intuitively
followed
fergus
to
the
place
where
miss
was
seated
the
sensation
of
hope
with
which
he
had
nursed
his
affection
in
absence
of
the
beloved
object
seemed
to
vanish
in
her
presence
and
like
one
striving
to
recover
the
particulars
of
a
forgotten
dream
he
would
have
given
the
world
at
that
moment
to
have
recollected
the
grounds
on
which
he
had
founded
expectations
which
now
seemed
so
delusive
he
accompanied
fergus
with
downcast
eyes
tingling
ears
and
the
feelings
of
the
criminal
who
while
the
melancholy
cart
moves
slowly
through
the
crowds
that
have
assembled
to
behold
his
execution
receives
no
clear
sensation
either
from
the
noise
which
fills
his
ears
or
the
tumult
on
which
he
casts
his
wandering
look
flora
seemed
a
little
a
very
little
affected
and
discomposed
at
his
approach
bring
you
an
adopted
son
of
ivor
said
fergus
i
receive
him
as
a
second
brother
replied
flora
there
was
a
slight
emphasis
on
the
word
which
would
have
escaped
every
ear
but
one
that
was
feverish
with
apprehension
it
was
however
distinctly
marked
and
combined
with
her
whole
tone
and
manner
plainly
intimated
will
never
think
of
waverley
as
a
more
intimate
connexion
edward
stopped
bowed
and
looked
at
fergus
who
bit
his
lip
a
movement
of
anger
which
proved
that
he
also
had
put
a
sinister
interpretation
on
the
reception
which
his
sister
had
given
his
friend
then
is
an
end
of
my
dream
such
was
waverley
first
thought
and
it
was
so
exquisitely
painful
as
to
banish
from
his
cheek
every
drop
of
blood
god
said
rose
bradwardine
is
not
yet
recovered
these
words
which
she
uttered
with
great
emotion
were
overheard
by
the
chevalier
himself
who
stepped
hastily
forward
and
taking
waverley
by
the
hand
inquired
kindly
after
his
health
and
added
that
he
wished
to
speak
with
him
by
a
strong
and
sudden
effort
which
the
circumstances
rendered
indispensable
waverley
recovered
himself
so
far
as
to
follow
the
chevalier
in
silence
to
a
recess
in
the
apartment
here
the
prince
detained
him
some
time
asking
various
questions
about
the
great
tory
and
catholic
families
of
england
their
connexions
their
influence
and
the
state
of
their
affections
towards
the
house
of
stuart
to
these
queries
edward
could
not
at
any
time
have
given
more
than
general
answers
and
it
may
be
supposed
that
in
the
present
state
of
his
feelings
his
responses
were
indistinct
even
to
confusion
the
chevalier
smiled
once
or
twice
at
the
incongruity
of
his
replies
but
continued
the
same
style
of
conversation
although
he
found
himself
obliged
to
occupy
the
principal
share
of
it
until
he
perceived
that
waverley
had
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
it
is
probable
that
this
long
audience
was
partly
meant
to
further
the
idea
which
the
prince
desired
should
be
entertained
among
his
followers
that
waverley
was
a
character
of
political
influence
but
it
appeared
from
his
concluding
expressions
that
he
had
a
different
and
motive
personal
to
our
hero
for
prolonging
the
conference
can
not
resist
the
temptation
he
said
boasting
of
my
own
discretion
as
a
lady
confidant
you
see
waverley
that
i
know
all
and
i
assure
you
i
am
deeply
interested
in
the
affair
but
my
good
young
friend
you
must
put
a
more
severe
restraint
upon
your
feelings
there
are
many
here
whose
eyes
can
see
as
clearly
as
mine
but
the
prudence
of
whose
tongues
may
not
be
equally
trusted
so
saying
he
turned
easily
away
and
joined
a
circle
of
officers
at
a
few
paces
distance
leaving
waverley
to
meditate
upon
his
parting
expression
which
though
not
intelligible
to
him
in
its
whole
purport
was
sufficiently
so
in
the
caution
which
the
last
word
recommended
making
therefore
an
effort
to
show
himself
worthy
of
the
interest
which
his
new
master
had
expressed
by
instant
obedience
to
his
recommendation
he
walked
up
to
the
spot
where
flora
and
miss
bradwardine
were
still
seated
and
having
made
his
compliments
to
the
latter
he
succeeded
even
beyond
his
own
expectation
in
entering
into
conversation
upon
general
topics
if
my
dear
reader
thou
hast
ever
happened
to
take
at
or
at
one
at
least
of
which
blanks
or
more
probably
both
you
will
be
able
to
fill
up
from
an
inn
near
your
own
residence
you
must
have
observed
and
doubtless
with
sympathetic
pain
the
reluctant
agony
with
which
the
poor
jades
at
first
apply
their
galled
necks
to
the
collars
of
the
harness
but
when
the
irresistible
arguments
of
the
have
prevailed
upon
them
to
proceed
a
mile
or
two
they
will
become
callous
to
the
first
sensation
and
being
warm
in
the
harness
as
the
said
may
term
it
proceed
as
if
their
withers
were
altogether
unwrung
this
simile
so
much
corresponds
with
the
state
of
waverley
feelings
in
the
course
of
this
memorable
evening
that
i
prefer
it
especially
as
being
i
trust
wholly
original
to
any
more
splendid
illustration
with
which
byshe
of
poetry
might
supply
me
exertion
like
virtue
is
its
own
reward
and
our
hero
had
moreover
other
stimulating
motives
for
persevering
in
a
display
of
affected
composure
and
indifference
to
flora
obvious
unkindness
pride
which
supplies
its
caustic
as
an
useful
though
severe
remedy
for
the
wounds
of
affection
came
rapidly
to
his
aid
distinguished
by
the
favour
of
a
prince
destined
he
had
room
to
hope
to
play
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
revolution
which
awaited
a
mighty
kingdom
excelling
probably
in
mental
acquirements
and
equalling
at
least
in
personal
accomplishments
most
of
the
noble
and
distinguished
persons
with
whom
he
was
now
ranked
young
wealthy
and
could
he
or
ought
he
to
droop
beneath
the
frown
of
a
capricious
beauty
o
nymph
unrelenting
and
cold
as
thou
art
my
bosom
is
proud
as
thine
own
with
the
feeling
expressed
in
these
beautiful
lines
which
however
were
not
then
written
footnote
they
occur
in
miss
seward
fine
verses
beginning
thy
rocks
stormy
lannow
adieu
waverley
determined
upon
convincing
flora
that
he
was
not
to
be
depressed
by
a
rejection
in
which
his
vanity
whispered
that
perhaps
she
did
her
own
prospects
as
much
injustice
as
his
and
to
aid
this
change
of
feeling
there
lurked
the
secret
and
unacknowledged
hope
that
she
might
learn
to
prize
his
affection
more
highly
when
she
did
not
conceive
it
to
be
altogether
within
her
own
choice
to
attract
or
repulse
it
there
was
a
mystic
tone
of
encouragement
also
in
the
chevalier
words
though
he
feared
they
only
referred
to
the
wishes
of
fergus
in
favour
of
an
union
between
him
and
his
sister
but
the
whole
circumstances
of
time
place
and
incident
combined
at
once
to
awaken
his
imagination
and
to
call
upon
him
for
a
manly
and
decisive
tone
of
conduct
leaving
to
fate
to
dispose
of
the
issue
should
he
appear
to
be
the
only
one
sad
and
disheartened
on
the
eve
of
battle
how
greedily
would
the
tale
be
commented
upon
by
the
slander
which
had
been
already
but
too
busy
with
his
fame
never
never
he
internally
resolved
shall
my
unprovoked
enemies
possess
such
an
advantage
over
my
reputation
under
the
influence
of
these
mixed
sensations
and
cheered
at
times
by
a
smile
of
intelligence
and
approbation
from
the
prince
as
he
passed
the
group
waverley
exerted
his
powers
of
fancy
animation
and
eloquence
and
attracted
the
general
admiration
of
the
company
the
conversation
gradually
assumed
the
tone
best
qualified
for
the
display
of
his
talents
and
acquisitions
the
gaiety
of
the
evening
was
exalted
in
character
rather
than
checked
by
the
approaching
dangers
of
the
morrow
all
nerves
were
strung
for
the
future
and
prepared
to
enjoy
the
present
this
mood
of
mind
is
highly
favourable
for
the
exercise
of
the
powers
of
imagination
for
poetry
and
for
that
eloquence
which
is
allied
to
poetry
waverley
as
we
have
elsewhere
observed
possessed
at
times
a
wonderful
flow
of
rhetoric
and
on
the
present
occasion
he
touched
more
than
once
the
higher
notes
of
feeling
and
then
again
ran
off
in
a
wild
voluntary
of
fanciful
mirth
he
was
supported
and
excited
by
kindred
spirits
who
felt
the
same
impulse
of
mood
and
time
and
even
those
of
more
cold
and
calculating
habits
were
hurried
along
by
the
torrent
many
ladies
declined
the
dance
which
still
went
forward
and
under
various
pretences
joined
the
party
to
which
the
young
englishman
seemed
to
have
attached
himself
he
was
presented
to
several
of
the
first
rank
and
his
manners
which
for
the
present
were
altogether
free
from
the
bashful
restraint
by
which
in
a
moment
of
less
excitation
they
were
usually
clouded
gave
universal
delight
flora
appeared
to
be
the
only
female
present
who
regarded
him
with
a
degree
of
coldness
and
reserve
yet
even
she
could
not
suppress
a
sort
of
wonder
at
talents
which
in
the
course
of
their
acquaintance
she
had
never
seen
displayed
with
equal
brilliancy
and
impressive
effect
i
do
not
know
whether
she
might
not
feel
a
momentary
regret
at
having
taken
so
decisive
a
resolution
upon
the
addresses
of
a
lover
who
seemed
fitted
so
well
to
fill
a
high
place
in
the
highest
stations
of
society
certainly
she
had
hitherto
accounted
among
the
incurable
deficiencies
of
disposition
the
mauvaise
honte
which
as
she
had
been
educated
in
the
first
foreign
circles
and
was
little
acquainted
with
the
shyness
of
english
manners
was
in
her
opinion
too
nearly
related
to
timidity
and
imbecility
of
disposition
but
if
a
passing
wish
occurred
that
waverley
could
have
rendered
himself
uniformly
thus
amiable
and
attractive
its
influence
was
momentary
for
circumstances
had
arisen
since
they
met
which
rendered
in
her
eyes
the
resolution
she
had
formed
respecting
him
final
and
irrevocable
with
opposite
feelings
rose
bradwardine
bent
her
whole
soul
to
listen
she
felt
a
secret
triumph
at
the
public
tribute
paid
to
one
whose
merit
she
had
learned
to
prize
too
early
and
too
fondly
without
a
thought
of
jealousy
without
a
feeling
of
fear
pain
or
doubt
and
undisturbed
by
a
single
selfish
consideration
she
resigned
herself
to
the
pleasure
of
observing
the
general
murmur
of
applause
when
waverley
spoke
her
ear
was
exclusively
filled
with
his
voice
when
others
answered
her
eye
took
its
turn
of
observation
and
seemed
to
watch
his
reply
perhaps
the
delight
which
she
experienced
in
the
course
of
that
evening
though
transient
and
followed
by
much
sorrow
was
in
its
nature
the
most
pure
and
disinterested
which
the
human
mind
is
capable
of
enjoying
said
the
chevalier
would
not
trust
my
mistress
in
the
company
of
your
young
friend
he
is
really
though
perhaps
somewhat
romantic
one
of
the
most
fascinating
young
men
whom
i
have
ever
seen
by
my
honour
sir
replied
the
baron
lad
can
sometimes
be
as
dowff
as
a
sexagenary
like
myself
if
your
royal
highness
had
seen
him
dreaming
and
dozing
about
the
banks

an

he

suddenly
acquired
all
this
fine

jocularity

fergus

it
can
only
be
the
inspiration

the
tartans

always
a
young

honour
i
have
hitherto
often
found
him
a
very
absent

inattentive
companion

the
more
obliged
to
him
said
the
prince
having
reserved
for
this
evening
qualities
which
even
such
intimate
friends
had
not
discovered

he
led
the
way
to
another
suite
of
apartments
and
assumed
the
seat
and
canopy
at
the
head
of
a
long
range
of
tables
with
an
air
of
dignity
mingled
with
courtesy
which
well
became
his
high
birth
and
lofty
pretensions
an
hour
had
hardly
flown
away
when
the
musicians
played
the
signal
for
parting

well
known
in

waverley
however
not
feeling
the
full
force
of
this
polite
simile
asked
him
no
further
questions
upon
extricating
themselves
from
the
mean
and
dirty
suburbs
of
the
metropolis
and
emerging
into
the
open
air
waverley
felt
a
renewal
of
both
health
and
spirits
and
turned
his
recollection
with
firmness
upon
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
and
with
hope
and
resolution
towards
those
of
the
approaching
day
when
he
had
surmounted
a
small
craggy
eminence
called
leonard
hill
the
king
park
or
the
hollow
between
the
mountain
of
arthur
seat
and
the
rising
grounds
on
which
the
southern
part
of
edinburgh
is
now
built
lay
beneath
him
and
displayed
a
singular
and
animating
prospect
it
was
occupied
by
the
army
of
the
highlanders
now
in
the
act
of
preparing
for
their
march
waverley
had
already
seen
something
of
the
kind
at
the
which
he
attended
with
fergus
macivor
but
this
was
on
a
scale
of
much
greater
magnitude
and
incomparably
deeper
interest
the
rocks
which
formed
the
background
of
the
scene
and
the
very
sky
itself
rang
with
the
clang
of
the
bagpipers
summoning
forth
each
with
his
appropriate
pibroch
his
chieftain
and
clan
the
mountaineers
rousing
themselves
from
their
couch
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
with
the
hum
and
bustle
of
a
confused
and
irregular
multitude
like
bees
alarmed
and
arming
in
their
hives
seemed
to
possess
all
the
pliability
of
movement
fitted
to
execute
military
manoeuvres
their
motions
appeared
spontaneous
and
confused
but
the
result
was
order
and
regularity
so
that
a
general
must
have
praised
the
conclusion
though
a
martinet
might
have
ridiculed
the
method
by
which
it
was
attained
the
sort
of
complicated
medley
created
by
the
hasty
arrangements
of
the
various
clans
under
their
respective
banners
for
the
purpose
of
getting
into
the
order
of
march
was
in
itself
a
gay
and
lively
spectacle
they
had
no
tents
to
strike
having
generally
and
by
choice
slept
upon
the
open
field
although
the
autumn
was
now
waning
and
the
nights
began
to
be
frosty
for
a
little
space
while
they
were
getting
into
order
there
was
exhibited
a
changing
fluctuating
and
confused
appearance
of
waving
tartans
and
floating
plumes
and
of
banners
displaying
the
proud
gathering
word
of
clanronald
ganion
coheriga
gainsay
who
dares
the
watchword
of
the
macfarlanes
forth
fortune
and
fill
the
fetters
the
motto
of
the
marquis
of
tullibardine
bydand
that
of
lord
lewis
gordon
and
the
appropriate
signal
words
and
emblems
of
many
other
chieftains
and
clans
at
length
the
mixed
and
wavering
multitude
arranged
themselves
into
a
narrow
and
dusky
column
of
great
length
stretching
through
the
whole
extent
of
the
valley
in
the
front
of
the
column
the
standard
of
the
chevalier
was
displayed
bearing
a
red
cross
upon
a
white
ground
with
the
motto
tandem
triumphans
the
few
cavalry
being
chiefly
lowland
gentry
with
their
domestic
servants
and
retainers
formed
the
advanced
guard
of
the
army
and
their
standards
of
which
they
had
rather
too
many
in
respect
of
their
numbers
were
seen
waving
upon
the
extreme
verge
of
the
horizon
many
horsemen
of
this
body
among
whom
waverley
accidentally
remarked
balmawhapple
and
his
lieutenant
jinker
which
last
however
had
been
reduced
with
several
others
by
the
advice
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
to
the
situation
of
what
he
called
reformed
officers
or
reformadoes
added
to
the
liveliness
though
by
no
means
to
the
regularity
of
the
scene
by
galloping
their
horses
as
fast
forward
as
the
press
would
permit
to
join
their
proper
station
in
the
van
the
fascinations
of
the
circes
of
the
high
street
and
the
potations
of
strength
with
which
they
had
been
drenched
over
night
had
probably
detained
these
heroes
within
the
walls
of
edinburgh
somewhat
later
than
was
consistent
with
their
morning
duty
of
such
loiterers
the
prudent
took
the
longer
and
circuitous
but
more
open
route
to
attain
their
place
in
the
march
by
keeping
at
some
distance
from
the
infantry
and
making
their
way
through
the
inclosures
to
the
right
at
the
expense
of
leaping
over
or
pulling
down
the
drystone
fences
the
irregular
appearance
and
vanishing
of
these
small
parties
of
horsemen
as
well
as
the
confusion
occasioned
by
those
who
endeavoured
though
generally
without
effect
to
press
to
the
front
through
the
crowd
of
highlanders
maugre
their
curses
oaths
and
opposition
added
to
the
picturesque
wildness
what
it
took
from
the
military
regularity
of
the
scene
while
waverley
gazed
upon
this
remarkable
spectacle
rendered
yet
more
impressive
by
the
occasional
discharge
of
from
the
castle
at
the
highland
guards
as
they
were
withdrawn
from
its
vicinity
to
join
their
main
body
callum
with
his
usual
freedom
of
interference
reminded
him
that
vich
lan
vohr
folk
were
nearly
at
the
head
of
the
column
of
march
which
was
still
distant
and
that
would
gang
very
fast
after
the
cannon
fired
thus
admonished
waverley
walked
briskly
forward
yet
often
casting
a
glance
upon
the
darksome
clouds
of
warriors
who
were
collected
before
and
beneath
him
a
nearer
view
indeed
rather
diminished
the
effect
impressed
on
the
mind
by
the
more
distant
appearance
of
the
army
the
leading
men
of
each
clan
were
well
armed
with
sword
target
and
fusee
to
which
all
added
the
dirk
and
most
the
steel
pistol
but
these
consisted
of
gentlemen
that
is
relations
of
the
chief
however
distant
and
who
had
an
immediate
title
to
his
countenance
and
protection
finer
and
hardier
men
could
not
have
been
selected
out
of
any
army
in
christendom
while
the
free
and
independent
habits
which
each
possessed
and
which
each
was
yet
so
well
taught
to
subject
to
the
command
of
his
chief
and
the
peculiar
mode
of
discipline
adopted
in
highland
warfare
rendered
them
equally
formidable
by
their
individual
courage
and
high
spirit
and
from
their
rational
conviction
of
the
necessity
of
acting
in
unison
and
of
giving
their
national
mode
of
attack
the
fullest
opportunity
of
success
but
in
a
lower
rank
to
these
there
were
found
individuals
of
an
inferior
description
the
common
peasantry
of
the
highland
country
who
although
they
did
not
allow
themselves
to
be
so
called
and
claimed
often
with
apparent
truth
to
be
of
more
ancient
descent
than
the
masters
whom
they
served
bore
nevertheless
the
livery
of
extreme
penury
being
indifferently
accoutred
and
worse
armed
half
naked
stinted
in
growth
and
miserable
in
aspect
each
important
clan
had
some
of
those
helots
attached
to
them
thus
the
maccouls
though
tracing
their
descent
from
comhal
the
father
of
finn
or
fingal
were
a
sort
of
gibeonites
or
hereditary
servants
to
the
stewarts
of
appin
the
macbeths
descended
from
the
unhappy
monarch
of
that
name
were
subjects
to
the
morays
and
clan
donnochy
or
robertsons
of
athole
and
many
other
examples
might
be
given
were
it
not
for
the
risk
of
hurting
any
pride
of
clanship
which
may
yet
be
left
and
thereby
drawing
a
highland
tempest
into
the
shop
of
my
publisher
now
these
same
helots
though
forced
into
the
field
by
the
arbitrary
authority
of
the
chieftains
under
whom
they
hewed
wood
and
drew
water
were
in
general
very
sparingly
fed
ill
dressed
and
worse
armed
the
latter
circumstance
was
indeed
owing
chiefly
to
the
general
disarming
act
which
had
been
carried
into
effect
ostensibly
through
the
whole
highlands
although
most
of
the
chieftains
contrived
to
elude
its
influence
by
retaining
the
weapons
of
their
own
immediate
clansmen
and
delivering
up
those
of
less
value
which
they
collected
from
these
inferior
satellites
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
as
we
have
already
hinted
many
of
these
poor
fellows
were
brought
to
the
field
in
a
very
wretched
condition
from
this
it
happened
that
in
bodies
the
van
of
which
were
admirably
well
armed
in
their
own
fashion
the
rear
resembled
actual
banditti
here
was
a
there
a
sword
without
a
scabbard
here
a
gun
without
a
lock
there
a
scythe
set
straight
upon
a
pole
and
some
had
only
their
dirks
and
bludgeons
or
stakes
pulled
out
of
hedges
the
grim
uncombed
and
wild
appearance
of
these
men
most
of
whom
gazed
with
all
the
admiration
of
ignorance
upon
the
most
ordinary
productions
of
domestic
art
created
surprise
in
the
lowlands
but
it
also
created
terror
so
little
was
the
condition
of
the
highlands
known
at
that
late
period
that
the
character
and
appearance
of
their
population
while
thus
sallying
forth
as
military
adventurers
conveyed
to
the
lowlanders
as
much
surprise
as
if
an
invasion
of
african
negroes
or
esquimaux
indians
had
issued
forth
from
the
northern
mountains
of
their
own
native
country
it
can
not
therefore
be
wondered
if
waverley
who
had
hitherto
judged
of
the
highlanders
generally
from
the
samples
which
the
policy
of
fergus
had
from
time
to
time
exhibited
should
have
felt
damped
and
astonished
at
the
daring
attempt
of
a
body
not
then
exceeding
four
thousand
men
and
of
whom
not
above
half
the
number
at
the
utmost
were
armed
to
change
the
fate
and
alter
the
dynasty
of
the
british
kingdoms

he
moved

still

only
piece
of
artillery
possessed
by
the
army

meditated

important
a
revolution

fired
as
the
signal
of
march
the
chevalier
had
expressed
a
wish
to
leave
this
useless
piece
of
ordnance
behind
him
but
to
his
surprise
the
highland
chiefs
interposed
to
solicit
that
it
might
accompany
their
march
pleading
the
prejudices
of
their
followers
who
little
accustomed
to
artillery
attached
a
degree
of
absurd
importance
to
this
and
expected
it
would
contribute
essentially
to
a
victory
which
they
could
only
owe
to
their
own
muskets
and
broadswords
two
or
three
french
artillerymen
were
therefore
appointed
to
the
management
of
this
military
engine
which
was
drawn
along
by
a
string
of
highland
ponies
and
was
after
all
only
used
for
the
purpose
of
firing
signals

gregor
fergus
advanced
to
embrace
the
volunteer
and
afford
him
a
warm
and
hearty
welcome
but
he
thought
it
necessary
to
apologize
for
the
diminished
numbers
of
his
battalion
which
did
not
exceed
three
hundred
men
by
observing
he
had
sent
a
good
many
out
upon
parties
the
real
fact
however
was
that
the
defection
of
donald
bean
lean
had
deprived
him
of
at
least
thirty
hardy
fellows
whose
services
he
had
fully
reckoned
upon
and
that
many
of
his
occasional
adherents
had
been
recalled
by
their
several
chiefs
to
the
standards
to
which
they
most
properly
owed
their
allegiance
the
rival
chief
of
the
great
northern
branch

of
his
own
clan
had
mustered
his
people
although
he
had
not
yet
declared
either
for
the
government
or
for
the
chevalier
and
by
his
intrigues
had
in
some
degree
diminished
the
force
with
which
fergus
took
the
field
to
make
amends
for
these
disappointments
it
was
universally
admitted
that
the
followers
of
vich
ian
vohr
in
point
of
appearance
equipment
arms
and
dexterity
in
using
them
equalled
the
most
choice

when
at

gave
our
hero
a
cordial
reception
as
the
sharer
of
their
future
dangers
and
expected
honours
the
route
pursued
by
the
highland
army
after
leaving
the
village
of
duddingston
was
for
some
time
the
common
betwixt
edinburgh
and
haddington
until
they
crossed
the
esk
at
musselburgh
when
instead
of
keeping
the
low
grounds
towards
the
sea
they
turned
more
inland
and
occupied
the
brow
of
the
eminence
called
carberry
hill
a
place
already
distinguished
in
scottish
history
as
the
spot
where
the
lovely
mary
surrendered
herself
to
her
insurgent
subjects
this
direction
was
chosen
because
the
chevalier
had
received
notice
that
the
army
of
the
government
arriving
by
sea
from
aberdeen
had
landed
at
dunbar
and
quartered
the
night
before
to
the
west
of
haddington
with
the
intention
of
falling
down
towards
the
and
approaching
edinburgh
by
the
lower
by
keeping
the
height
which
overhung
that
road
in
many
places
it
was
hoped
the
highlanders
might
find
an
opportunity
of
attacking
them
to
advantage
the
army
therefore
halted
upon
the
ridge
of
carberry
hill
both
to
refresh
the
soldiers
and
as
a
central
situation
from
which
their
march
could
be
directed
to
any
point
that
the
motions
of
the
enemy
might
render
most
advisable
while
they
remained
in
this
position
a
messenger
arrived
in
haste
to
desire
to
come
to
the
prince
adding
that
their
advanced
post
had
had
a
skirmish
with
some
of
the
enemy
cavalry
and
that
the
baron
of
bradwardine
had
sent
in
a
few
prisoners
waverley
walked
forward
out
of
the
line
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
soon
observed
five
or
six
of
the
troopers
who
covered
with
dust
had
galloped
in
to
announce
that
the
enemy
were
in
full
march
westward
along
the
coast
passing
still
a
little
farther
on
he
was
struck
with
a
groan
which
issued
from
a
hovel
he
approached
the
spot
and
heard
a
voice
in
the
provincial
english
of
his
native
county
which
endeavoured
though
frequently
interrupted
by
pain
to
repeat
the
lord
prayer
the
voice
of
distress
always
found
a
ready
answer
in
our
hero
bosom
he
entered
the
hovel
which
seemed
to
be
intended
for
what
is
called
in
the
pastoral
counties
of
scotland
a
and
in
its
obscurity
edward
could
only
at
first
discern
a
sort
of
red
bundle
for
those
who
had
stripped
the
wounded
man
of
his
arms
and
part
of
his
clothes
had
left
him
the
in
which
he
was
enveloped
the
love
of
god
said
the
wounded
man
as
he
heard
waverley
step
me
a
single
drop
of
water
shall
have
it
answered
waverley
at
the
same
time
raising
him
in
his
arms
bearing
him
to
the
door
of
the
hut
and
giving
him
some
drink
from
his
flask
should
know
that
voice
said
the
man
but
looking
on
waverley
dress
with
a
bewildered
look
this
is
not
the
young
squire
this
was
the
common
phrase
by
which
edward
was
distinguished
on
the
estate
of
and
the
sound
now
thrilled
to
his
heart
with
the
thousand
recollections
which
the
accents
of
his
native
country
had
already
contributed
to
awaken
he
said
gazing
on
the
ghastly
features
which
death
was
fast
disfiguring
this
be
you
never
thought
to
hear
an
english
voice
again
said
the
wounded
man
left
me
to
live
or
die
here
as
i
could
when
they
found
i
would
say
nothing
about
the
strength
of
the
regiment
but
o
squire
how
could
you
stay
from
us
so
long
and
let
us
be
tempted
by
that
fiend
of
the
pit
ruffin
we
should
have
followed
you
through
flood
and
fire
to
be
sure
i
assure
you
houghton
you
have
been
vilely
imposed
upon
often
thought
so
said
houghton
they
showed
us
your
very
seal
and
so
tims
was
shot
and
i
was
reduced
to
the
ranks
not
exhaust
your
strength
in
speaking
said
edward
will
get
you
a
surgeon
presently
he
saw
approaching
who
was
now
returning
from
headquarters
where
he
had
attended
a
council
of
war
and
hastened
to
meet
him
news
shouted
the
chief
shall
be
at
it
in
less
than
two
hours
the
prince
has
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
advance
and
as
he
drew
his
sword
called
out
my
friends
i
have
thrown
away
the
scabbard
come
waverley
we
move
instantly
moment
a
moment
this
poor
prisoner
is
dying
where
shall
i
find
a
surgeon
where
should
you
we
have
none
you
know
but
two
or
three
french
fellows
who
i
believe
are
little
better
than
the
man

bleed
to
death
fellow
said
fergus
in
a
momentary
fit
of
compassion
then
instantly
added
it
will
be
a
thousand
men
fate
before
night
so
come
along
can
not
i
tell
you
he
is
a
son
of
a
tenant
of
my
uncle
if
he
a
follower
of
yours
he
must
be
looked
to

send

you
but
ceade
millia
continued
the
impatient
chieftain
made
an
old
soldier
like
bradwardine
send
dying
men
here
to
cumber
us
callum
came
with
his
usual
alertness
and
indeed
waverley
rather
gained
than
lost
in
the
opinion
of
the
highlanders
by
his
anxiety
about
the
wounded
man
they
would
not
have
understood
the
general
philanthropy
which
rendered
it
almost
impossible
for
waverley
to
have
passed
any
person
in
such
distress
but
as
apprehending
that
the
sufferer
was
one
of
his
they
unanimously
allowed
that
waverley
conduct
was
that
of
a
kind
and
considerate
chieftain
who
merited
the
attachment
of
his
people
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
poor
humphrey
breathed
his
last
praying
his
young
master
when
he
returned
to
to
be
kind
to
old
job
houghton
and
his
dame
and
conjuring
him
not
to
fight
with
these
wild
against
old
england
when
his
last
breath
was
drawn
waverley
who
had
beheld
with
sincere
sorrow
and
no
slight
tinge
of
remorse
the
final
agonies
of
mortality
now
witnessed
for
the
first
time
commanded
callum
to
remove
the
body
into
the
hut
this
the
young
highlander
performed
not
without
examining
the
pockets
of
the
defunct
which
however
he
remarked
had
been
pretty
well
spunged
he
took
the
cloak
however
and
proceeding
with
the
provident
caution
of
a
spaniel
hiding
a
bone
concealed
it
among
some
furze
and
carefully
marked
the
spot
observing
that
if
he
chanced
to
return
that
way
it
would
be
an
excellent
rokelay
for
his
auld
mother
elspat
it
was
by
a
considerable
exertion
that
they
regained
their
place
in
the
marching
column
which
was
now
moving
rapidly
forward
to
occupy
the
high
grounds
above
the
village
of
tranent
between
which
and
the
sea
lay
the
purposed
march
of
the
opposite
army
this
melancholy
interview
with
his
late
sergeant
forced
many
unavailing
and
painful
reflections
upon
waverley
mind
it
was
clear
from
the
confession
of
the
man
that
colonel
proceedings
had
been
strictly
warranted
and
even
rendered
indispensable
by
the
steps
taken
in
edward
name
to
induce
the
soldiers
of
his
troop
to
mutiny
the
circumstance
of
the
seal
he
now
for
the
first
time
recollected
and
that
he
had
lost
it
in
the
cavern
of
the
robber
bean
lean
that
the
artful
villain
had
secured
it
and
used
it
as
the
means
of
carrying
on
an
intrigue
in
the
regiment
for
his
own
purposes
was
sufficiently
evident
and
edward
had
now
little
doubt
that
in
the
packet
placed
in
his
portmanteau
by
his
daughter
he
should
find
farther
light
upon
his
proceedings
in
the
meanwhile
the
repeated
expostulation
of
houghton
squire
why
did
you
leave
us
rung
like
a
knell
in
his
ears
he
said
have
indeed
acted
towards
you
with
thoughtless
cruelty
i
brought
you
from
your
paternal
fields
and
the
protection
of
a
generous
and
kind
landlord
and
when
i
had
subjected
you
to
all
the
rigour
of
military
discipline
i
shunned
to
bear
my
own
share
of
the
burden
and
wandered
from
the
duties
i
had
undertaken
leaving
alike
those
whom
it
was
my
business
to
protect
and
my
own
reputation
to
suffer
under
the
artifices
of
villainy
o
indolence
and
indecision
of
mind
if
not
in
yourselves
vices
to
how
much
exquisite
misery
and
mischief
do
you
frequently
prepare
the
way
chapter
xlvi
the
eve
of
battle
although
the
highlanders
marched
on
very
fast
the
sun
was
declining
when
they
arrived
upon
the
brow
of
those
high
grounds
which
command
an
open
and
extensive
plain
stretching
northward
to
the
sea
on
which
are
situated
but
at
a
considerable
distance
from
each
other
the
small
villages
of
seaton
and
cockenzie
and
the
larger
one
of
preston
one
of
the
low
coastroads
to
edinburgh
passed
through
this
plain
issuing
upon
it
from
the
enclosures
of
seaton
house
and
at
the
town
or
village
of
preston
again
entering
the
denies
of
an
enclosed
country
by
this
way
the
english
general
had
chosen
to
approach
the
metropolis
both
as
most
commodious
for
his
cavalry
and
being
probably
of
opinion
that
by
doing
so
he
would
meet
in
front
with
the
highlanders
advancing
from
edinburgh
in
the
opposite
direction
in
this
he
was
mistaken
for
the
sound
judgment
of
the
chevalier
or
of
those
to
whose
advice
he
listened
left
the
direct
passage
free
but
occupied
the
strong
ground
by
which
it
was
overlooked
and
commanded
when
the
highlanders
reached
the
heights
above
the
plain
described
they
were
immediately
formed
in
array
of
battle
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
van
of
the
english
appeared
issuing
from
among
the
trees
and
enclosures
of
seaton
with
the
purpose
of
occupying
the
level
plain
between
the
high
ground
and
the
sea
the
space
which
divided
the
armies
being
only
about
half
a
mile
in
breadth
waverley
could
plainly
see
the
squadrons
of
dragoons
issue
one
after
another
from
the
defiles
with
their
videttes
in
front
and
form
upon
the
plain
with
their
front
opposed
to
that
of
the
prince
army
they
were
followed
by
a
train
of
which
when
they
reached
the
flank
of
the
dragoons
were
also
brought
into
line
and
pointed
against
the
heights
the
march
was
continued
by
three
or
four
regiments
of
infantry
marching
in
open
column
their
fixed
bayonets
showing
like
successive
hedges
of
steel
and
their
arms
glancing
like
lightning
as
at
a
signal
given
they
also
at
once
wheeled
up
and
were
placed
in
direct
opposition
to
the
highlanders
a
second
train
of
artillery
with
another
regiment
of
horse
closed
the
long
march
and
formed
on
the
left
flank
of
the
infantry
the
whole
line
facing
southward
while
the
english
army
went
through
these
evolutions
the
highlanders
showed
equal
promptitude
and
zeal
for
battle
as
fast
as
the
clans
came
upon
the
ridge
which
fronted
their
enemy
they
were
formed
into
line
so
that
both
armies
got
into
complete
order
of
battle
at
the
same
moment
when
this
was
accomplished
the
highlanders
set
up
a
tremendous
yell
which
was
by
the
heights
behind
them
the
regulars
who
were
in
high
spirits
returned
a
loud
shout
of
defiance
and
fired
one
or
two
of
their
cannon
upon
an
advanced
post
of
the
highlanders
the
latter
displayed
great
earnestness
to
proceed
instantly
to
the
attack
evan
dhu
urging
to
fergus
by
way
of
argument
that
sidier
roy
was
tottering
like
an
egg
upon
a
staff
and
that
they
had
the
vantage
of
the
onset
for
even
a
haggis
god
bless
her
could
charge
down
hill
but
the
ground
through
which
the
mountaineers
must
have
descended
although
not
of
great
extent
was
impracticable
in
its
character
being
not
only
marshy
but
intersected
with
walls
of
dry
stone
and
traversed
in
its
whole
length
by
a
very
broad
and
deep
ditch
circumstances
which
must
have
given
the
musketry
of
the
regulars
dreadful
advantages
before
the
mountaineers
could
have
used
their
swords
on
which
they
were
taught
to
rely
the
authority
of
the
commanders
was
therefore
interposed
to
curb
the
impetuosity
of
the
highlanders
and
only
a
few
marksmen
were
sent
down
the
descent
to
skirmish
with
the
enemy
advanced
posts
and
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
here
then
was
a
military
spectacle
of
no
ordinary
interest
or
usual
occurrence
the
two
armies
so
different
in
aspect
and
discipline
yet
each
admirably
trained
in
its
own
peculiar
mode
of
war
upon
whose
conflict
the
temporary
fate
at
least
of
scotland
appeared
to
depend
now
faced
each
other
like
two
gladiators
in
the
arena
each
meditating
upon
the
mode
of
attacking
their
enemy
the
leading
officers
and
the
general
staff
of
each
army
could
be
distinguished
in
front
of
their
lines
busied
with
to
watch
each
other
motions
and
occupied
in
despatching
the
orders
and
receiving
the
intelligence
conveyed
by
the
and
orderly
men
who
gave
life
to
the
scene
by
galloping
along
in
different
directions
as
if
the
fate
of
the
day
depended
upon
the
speed
of
their
horses
the
space
between
the
armies
was
at
times
occupied
by
the
partial
and
irregular
contest
of
individual
and
a
hat
or
bonnet
was
occasionally
seen
to
fall
as
a
wounded
man
was
borne
off
by
his
comrades
these
however
were
but
trifling
skirmishes
for
it
suited
the
views
of
neither
party
to
advance
in
that
direction
from
the
neighbouring
hamlets
the
peasantry
cautiously
showed
themselves
as
if
watching
the
issue
of
the
expected
engagement
and
at
no
great
distance
in
the
bay
were
two
vessels
bearing
the
english
flag
whose
tops
and
yards
were
crowded
with
less
timid
spectators
when
this
awful
pause
had
lasted
for
a
short
time
fergus
with
another
chieftain
received
orders
to
detach
their
clans
towards
the
village
of

in
order
to
threaten
the
right
flank
of

and
compel
him
to
a

to
enable
him
to
execute

the

of

occupied
the
of

situation

a
convenient
place
as
evan

remarked
any
gentleman
who
might
have
the
misfortune
to
be
killed
and
chanced
to
be
curious
about
christian
burial
to
check
or
dislodge
this
party
the
english
general
detached
two
guns
escorted
by
a
strong
party
of
cavalry
they
approached
so
near
that
waverley
could
plainly
recognise
the
standard
of
the
troop
he
had
formerly
commanded
and
hear
the
trumpets
and
sound
the
signal
of
advance
which
he
had
so
often
obeyed
he
could
hear
too
the
word
given
in
the
english
dialect
by
the
equally
voice
of
the
commanding
officer
for
whom
he
had
once
felt
so
much
respect
it
was
at
that
instant
that
looking
around
him
he
saw
the
wild
dress
and
appearance
of
his
highland
associates
heard
their
whispers
in
an
uncouth
and
unknown
language
looked
upon
his
own
dress
so
unlike
that
which
he
had
worn
from
his
infancy
and
wished
to
awake
from
what
seemed
at
the
moment
a
dream
strange
horrible
and
unnatural
god
he
muttered
i
then
a
traitor
to
my
country
a
renegade
to
my
standard
and
a
foe
as
that
poor
dying
wretch
expressed
himself
to
my
native
england
ere
he
could
digest
or
smother
the
recollection
the
tall
military
form
of
his
late
commander
came
full
in
view
for
the
purpose

reconnoitring

said
callum
cautiously
raising
his
fusee
over
the
wall
under
which
he
lay
couched
at
scarce
sixty
yards
distance
edward
felt
as
if
he
was
about
to
see
a
parricide
committed
in
his
presence
for
the
venerable
grey
hair
and
striking
countenance
of
the
veteran
recalled
the
almost
paternal
respect
with
which
his
officers
universally
regarded
him

ere
he

colonel
gardiner
unconscious
of
the
danger
he
had
escaped
turned
his
horse
round
and
rode
slowly
back
to
the
front
of
his
regiment
by
this
time
the
regular
army
had
assumed
a
new
line
with
one
flank
inclined
towards
the
sea
and
the
other
resting
upon
the
village
of
preston
and
as
similar
difficulties
occurred
in
attacking
their
new
position
fergus
and
the
rest
of
the
detachment
were
recalled
to
their
former
post
this
alteration
created
the
necessity
of
a
corresponding
change
in
general
army
which
was
again
brought
into
a
line
parallel
with
that
of
the
highlanders
in
these
manoeuvres
on
both
sides
the
daylight
was
nearly
consumed
and
both
armies
prepared
to
rest
upon
their
arms
for
the
night
in
the
lines
which
they
respectively
occupied

to
his

we
wrap
ourselves
in
our
plaids
let
us
go
see
what
the
baron
is
doing
in
the
rear
of
the
line
when
they
approached
his
post
they
found
the
good
old
careful
officer
after
having
sent
out
his
night
patrols
and
posted
his
sentinels
engaged
in
reading
the
evening
service
of
the
episcopal
church
to
the
remainder
of
his
troop
his
voice
was
loud
and
sonorous
and
though
his
spectacles
upon
his
nose
and
the
appearance
of
saunders
saunderson
in
military
array
performing
the
functions
of
clerk
had
something
ludicrous
yet
the
circumstances
of
danger
in
which
they
stood
the
military
costume
of
the
audience
and
the
appearance
of
their
horses
saddled
and
picqueted
behind
them
gave
an
impressive
and
solemn
effect
to
the
office
of
devotion

confessed
ere
you
were
awake

to

what

as
a

for

piece
of
nocturnal
duty

then
finally
sunk
upon
the

with
a
shrill
and
mournful
cadence
the

who
had
now
reached
their
post
stood
and
looked
round
them
ere
they
lay
down
to
rest
the

twinkled
with
stars
but
a
rising
from
the
ocean
covered
the
eastern
horizon
and
rolled
in
white
wreaths
along
the

where
the
adverse
army
lay
couched
upon

their

posts
were
pushed
as
far
as
the
side
of

at

had
kindled
large
fires
at
different
intervals
gleaming
with
obscure
and
hazy
lustre
through
the
heavy
fog
which
encircled
them
with

by
a

route

sweeping
to

and

and
enables

to

the

spread
unanimous
joy
and
each

hastened
to

with
as
little
noise
as
possible
the
army
moving
by
its
right
from
off
the

on
which
they
had

soon
entered
the

through

conducting

with
astonishing
silence

that
for

they
had

this
was
lost

the

faded
before
approaching
day
and
the
head
of
the
marching
column
continuing
its
descent
plunged
as
it
were
into
the
heavy
ocean
of
fog
which
rolled
its
white
waves
over
the
whole
plain
and
over
the
sea
by
which
it
was
bounded
some
difficulties
were
now
to
be
encountered
inseparable
from
darkness
a
narrow
broken
and
marshy
path
and
the
necessity
of
preserving
union
in
the
march
these
however
were
less
inconvenient
to
highlanders
from
their
habits
of
life
than
they
would
have
been
to
any
other
troops
and
they
continued
a
steady
and
swift
movement
as
the
clan
of
ivor
approached
the
firm
ground
following
the
track
of
those
who
preceded
them
the
challenge
of
a
patrol
was
heard
through
the
mist
though
they
could
not
see
the
dragoon
by
whom
it
was
made

cried
fergus
let
none
answer
as
he
values

press
forward
and
they
continued
their
march
with
silence
and
rapidity
the
patrol
fired
his
carabine
upon
the

the
report
was
instantly
followed

galloped

the

heard

give
the
alarm
the
clan
of
fergus
had
now
gained
the
firm
plain
which
had
lately
borne
a
large
crop
of
corn
but
the
harvest
was
gathered
in
and
the
expanse
was
unbroken
by
tree
bush
or
interruption
of
any
kind
the
rest
of
the
army
were
following
fast
when
they
heard
the
drums
of
the
enemy
beat
the
general
surprise
however
had
made
no
part
of
their
plan
so
they
were
not
disconcerted
by
this
intimation
that
the
foe
was
upon
his
guard
and
prepared
to
receive
them
it
only
hastened
their
dispositions
for
the
combat
which
were
very
simple
the
highland
army
which
now
occupied
the
eastern
end
of
the
wide
plain
or
stubble
field
so
often
referred
to
was
drawn
up
in
two
lines
extending
from
the
morass
towards
the
sea
the
first
was
destined
to
charge
the
enemy
the
second
to
act
as
a
reserve
the
few
horse
whom
the
prince
headed
in
person
remained
between
the
two
lines
the
adventurer
had
intimated
a
resolution
to
charge
in
person
at
the
head
of
his
first
line
but
his
purpose
was
deprecated
by
all
around
him
and
he
was
with
difficulty
induced
to
abandon
it
both
lines
were
now
moving
forward
the
first
prepared
for
instant

the
clans
of
which
it
was
composed

each
a

strength
of

and
for
the

placed
in

of
each
of
these
irregular
subdivisions
the
others
in
the
rear
shouldered
forward
the
front
and
by
their
pressure
added
both
physical
impulse
and
additional
ardour
and
confidence
to
those
who
were

cried
fergus
throwing
off
his

before
the
sun
is
above
the
sea
the
clansmen
on
every
side
stript
their
plaids
prepared
their
arms
and
there
was
an
awful
pause
of
about
three
minutes
during
which
the
men
pulling
off
their
bonnets
raised
their
faces
to
heaven
and
uttered
a
short
prayer
then
pulled
their
bonnets
over
their
brows
and
began
to
move
forward
at
first
slowly
waverley
felt
his
heart
at
that
moment
throb
as
it
would
have
burst
from
his
bosom
it
was
not
fear
it
was
not
ardour
it
was
a
compound
of
both
a
new
and
deeply
energetic
impulse
that
with
its
first
emotion
chilled
and
astounded
then
fevered
and
maddened
his
mind
the
sounds
around
him
combined
to
exalt
his
enthusiasm
the
pipes
played
and
the
clans
rushed
forward
each
in
its
own
dark
column
as
they
advanced
they
mended
their
pace
and
the
muttering
sounds
of
the
men
to
each
other
began
to
swell
into
a
wild
cry
at
this
moment
the
sun
which
was
now
risen
above
the
horizon
dispelled
the
mist
the
vapours
rose
like
a
curtain
and
showed

glittered
with
the
appointments

by

the

impressed
no

assailants

tremendous

the
rest

well
known
the

who
were
commanded
to
charge
the
advancing
highlanders
in
the
flank
received
an
irregular
fire
from
their
fusees
as
they
ran
on
and
seized
with
a
disgraceful
panic
wavered

disbanded
and
galloped
from
the
field
the
artillery
men
deserted
by
the
cavalry
fled
after
discharging
their
pieces
and
the
highlanders
who
dropped
their
guns
when
fired
and
drew
their
broadswords
rushed
with
headlong
fury
against
the
infantry
it
was
at
this
moment
of
confusion
and
terror
that
waverley
remarked
an
english
officer
apparently
of
high
rank
standing
alone
and
unsupported
by
a
fieldpiece
which
after
the
flight
of
the
men
by
whom
it
was
wrought
he
had
himself
levelled
and
discharged
against
the
clan
of
the
nearest
group
of
highlanders
within
his
aim
struck
with
his
tall
martial
figure
and
eager
to
save
him
from
inevitable
destruction
waverley
outstripped
for
an
instant
even
the
speediest
of
the
warriors
and
reaching
the
spot
first
called
to
him
to
surrender
the
officer
replied
by
a
thrust
with
his
sword
which
waverley
received
in
his
target
and
in
turning
it
aside
the
weapon
broke
at
the
same
time
the
of
dugald
mahony
was
in
the
act
of
descending
upon

waverley
intercepted
and
prevented
the
blow
and
the
officer
perceiving
further
resistance
unavailing
and
struck
with
edward
generous
anxiety
for
his
safety
resigned
the
fragment
of
his
sword
and
was
committed
by
waverley
to
dugald
with
strict
charge
to
use
him
well
and
not
to
pillage
his
person
promising
him
at
the
same
time
full
indemnification
for
the
spoil
on
edward

the
battle
for
a
few
minutes
raged
fierce
and
thick
the
english
infantry
trained
in
the
wars
in
flanders
stood
their
ground
with
great
courage
but
their
extended
files
were
pierced
and
broken
in
many
places
by
the
close
masses
of
the
clans
and
in
the
personal
struggle
which
ensued
the
nature
of
the
highlanders
weapons
and
their
extraordinary
fierceness
and
activity
gave
them
a
decided
superiority
over
those
who
had
been
accustomed
to
trust
much
to
their
array
and
discipline
and
felt
that
the
one
was
broken
and
the
other
useless

as
he
cast
his
eyes
towards
this
scene
of
smoke
and
slaughter
observed
colonel
gardiner
deserted
by
his
own
soldiers
in
spite
of
all
his
attempts
to
rally
them
yet
spurring
his
horse
through
the
field
to
take
the
command
of
a
small
body

arranged
against

own
park

his
house

a
desperate
and
unavailing

waverley
could
perceive
that
he
had
already
received
many
wounds
his
clothes
and
saddle
being
marked
with
blood
to
save
this
good
and
brave
man
became
the
instant
object
of
his
most
anxious
exertions
but
he
could
only
witness
his
fall
ere
edward
could
make
his
way
among
the
highlanders
who
furious
and
eager
for
spoil
now
thronged
upon
each
other

saw
his
former
commander
brought
from

by
the
blow
of
a
scythe

him
receive

on
the
ground
more
wounds
than

have
let
out
twenty
lives
when
waverley
came
up
however
perception
had
not
entirely
fled
the
dying
warrior
seemed
to
recognize
edward
for
he
fixed
his
eye
upon
him
with
an
upbraiding
yet
sorrowful
look
and
appeared
to
struggle
for
utterance
but
he
felt
that
death
was
dealing
closely
with
him
and
resigning
his
purpose
and
folding
his
hands
as
if
in
devotion
he
gave
up
his
soul
to
his
creator
the
look
with
which
he
regarded
waverley
in
his
dying
moments
did
not
strike
him
so
deeply
at

crisis
of

then
stroked
with
great
complacency
the
animal
which
had
borne
him
through
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
having
taken
a
tender
leave

and

i
should
have
liked
to
have
shown

the
true
points
of
the
pralium

equestrian
combat
whilk
their
cowardice
has
postponed
and
which
i
hold
to
be
the
pride
and
terror
of
warfare
weel
i
have
fought
once
more
in
this
old
quarrel
though
i
admit
i
could
not
be
so
far
ben
as
you
lads
being
that
it
was
my
point
of
duty
to
keep
together
our
handful
of
horse
and
no
cavalier
ought
in
any
wise
to
begrudge
honour
that
befalls
his
companions
even
though
they
are
ordered
upon
thrice
his
danger
whilk
another
time
by
the
blessing
of
god
may
be
his
own
case
but
glennaquoich
and
you
waverley
i
pray
ye
to
give
me
your
best
advice
on
a
matter
of
mickle
weight
and
which
deeply
affects
the
honour
of
the
house
of
bradwardine
i
crave
your
pardon
ensign
maccombich
and
yours
inveraughlin
and
yours
edderalshendrach
and
yours
sir
the
last
person
he
addressed
was
ballenkeiroch
who
remembering
the
death
of
his
son
loured
on
him
with
a
look
of
savage
defiance
the
baron
quick
as
lightning
at
taking
umbrage
had
already
bent
his
brow
when
glennaquoich
dragged
his
major
from
the
spot
and
remonstrated
with
him
in
the
authoritative
tone
of
a
chieftain
on
the
madness
of
reviving
a
quarrel
in
such
a
moment
ground
is
cumbered
with
carcasses
said
the
old
mountaineer
turning
sullenly
away
more
would
hardly
have
been
kenn
upon
it
and
if
it
wasna
for
yoursell
vich
lan
vohr
that
one
should
be
bradwardine
or
mine
the
chief
soothed
while
he
hurried
him
away
and
then
returned
to
the
baron
is
ballenkeiroch
he
said
in
an
under
and
confidential
voice
of
the
young
man
who
fell
eight
years
since
in
the
unlucky
affair
at
the
mains
said
the
baron
instantly
relaxing
the
doubtful
sternness
of
his
features
can
take
mickle
frae
a
man
to
whom
i
have
unhappily
rendered
sic
a
displeasure
as
that
ye
were
right
to
apprise
me
glennaquoich
he
may
look
as
black
as
midnight
at
martinmas
ere
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
shall
say
he
does
him
wrang
ah
i
have
nae
male
lineage
and
i
should
bear
with
one
i
have
made
childless
though
you
are
aware
the
was
made
up
to
your
ain
satisfaction
by
assythment
and
that
i
have
since
expedited
letters
of
slains
weel
as
i
have
said
i
have
no
male
issue
and
yet
it
is
needful
that
i
maintain
the
honour
of
my
house
and
it
is
on
that
score
i
prayed
ye
for
your
peculiar
and
private
attention
the
two
young
men
awaited
to
hear
him
in
anxious
curiosity
doubt
na
lads
he
proceeded
your
education
has
been
sae
seen
to
that
ye
understand
the
true
nature
of
the
feudal
tenures
fergus
afraid
of
an
endless
dissertation
answered
baron
and
touched
waverley
as
a
signal
to
express
no
ignorance
ye
are
aware
i
doubt
not
that
the
holding
of
the
barony
of
bradwardine
is
of
a
nature
alike
honourable
and
peculiar
being
blanch
which
craig
opines
ought
to
be
latinated
blancum
or
rather
francum
a
free
holding
pro
servitio
detrahendi
seu
exuendi
caligas
regis
post
battalliam
here
fergus
turned
his
falcon
eye
upon
edward
with
an
almost
imperceptible
rise
of
his
eyebrow
to
which
his
shoulders
corresponded
in
the
same
degree
of
elevation
twa
points
of
dubitation
occur
to
me
upon
this
topic
first
whether
this
service
or
feudal
homage
be
at
any
event
due
to
the
person
of
the
prince
the
words
being
per
expressum
caligas
regis
the
boots
of
the
king
himself
and
i
pray
your
opinion
anent
that
particular
before
we
proceed
farther
he
is
prince
regent
answered
with
laudable
composure
of
countenance
in
the
court
of
france
all
the
honours
are
rendered
to
the
person
of
the
regent
which
are
due
to
that
of
the
king
besides
were
i
to
pull
off
either
of
their
boots
i
would
render
that
service
to
the
young
chevalier
ten
times
more
willingly
than
to
his
father
ay
but
i
talk
not
of
personal
predilections
however
your
authority
is
of
great
weight
as
to
the
usages
of
the
court
of
france
and
doubtless
the
prince
as
alter
ego
may
have
a
right
to
claim
the
homagium
of
the
great
tenants
of
the
crown
since
all
faithful
subjects
are
commanded
in
the
commission
of
regency
to
respect
him
as
the
king
own
person
far
therefore
be
it
from
me
to
diminish
the
lustre
of
his
authority
by
withholding
this
act
of
homage
so
peculiarly
calculated
to
give
it
splendour
for
i
question
if
the
emperor
of
germany
hath
his
boots
taken
off
by
a
free
baron
of
the
empire
but
here
lieth
the
second
difficulty
the
prince
wears
no
boots
but
simply
brogues
and
trews
this
last
dilemma
had
almost
disturbed
fergus
gravity
said
he
know
baron
the
proverb
tells
us
it
ill
taking
the
breeks
off
a
highlandman
and
the
boots
are
here
in
the
same
predicament
word
caligae
however
continued
the
baron
i
admit
that
by
family
tradition
and
even
in
our
ancient
evidents
it
is
explained
means
in
its
primitive
sense
rather
sandals
and
caius
caesar
the
nephew
and
successor
of
caius
tiberius
received
the
agnomen
of
caligula
a
caligulis
sine
caligis
levioribus
quibus
adolescentior
usus
fuerat
in
exercitu
germanici
patris
sui
and
the
caligae
were
also
proper
to
the
monastic
bodies
for
we
read
in
an
ancient
glossarium
upon
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
in
the
abbey
of
saint
amand
that
caligae
were
tied
with
latchets
will
apply
to
the
brogues
said
fergus
will
so
my
dear
glennaquoich
and
the
words
are
express
caligae
dicta
sunt
quia
ligantur
nam
socci
non
ligantur
sed
tantum
intromittuntur
that
is
caligae
are
denominated
from
the
ligatures
wherewith
they
are
bound
whereas
socci
which
may
be
analogous
to
our
mules
whilk
the
english
denominate
slippers
are
only
slipped
upon
the
feet
the
words
of
the
charter
are
also
alternative
exuere
seu
detrahere
that
is
to
undo
as
in
the
case
of
sandals
or
brogues
and
to
pull
of
as
we
say
vernacularly
concerning
boots
yet
i
would
we
had
more
light
but
i
fear
there
is
little
chance
of
finding
hereabout
any
erudite
author
de
re
vestiaria
should
doubt
it
very
much
said
the
chieftain
looking
around
on
the
straggling
highlanders
who
were
returning
loaded
with
spoils
of
the
slain
the
res
vestiaria
itself
seems
to
be
in
some
request
at
present
this
remark
coming
within
the
baron
idea
of
jocularity
he
honoured
it
with
a
smile
but
immediately
resumed
what
to
him
appeared
very
serious
business
macwheeble
indeed
holds
an
opinion
that
this
honorary
service
is
due
from
its
very
nature
si
petatur
tantum
only
if
his
royal
highness
shall
require
of
the
great
tenant
of
the
crown
to
perform
that
personal
duty
and
indeed
he
pointed
out
the
case
in
dirleton
doubts
and
queries
grippit
versus
spicer
anent
the
eviction
of
an
estate
ob
non
solutum
canonem
that
is
for
payment
of
a
of
three
a
year
whilk
were
taxt
to
be
worth
of
a
penny
scots
in
whilk
the
defender
was
assoilzied
but
i
deem
it
safest
wi
your
good
favour
to
place
myself
in
the
way
of
rendering
the
prince
this
service
and
to
proffer
performance
thereof
and
i
shall
cause
the
bailie
to
attend
with
a
schedule
of
a
protest
whilk
he
has
here
prepared
taking
out
a
paper
intimating
that
if
it
shall
be
his
royal
highness
pleasure
to
accept
of
other
assistance
at
pulling
off
his
caligae
whether
the
same
shall
be
rendered
boots
or
brogues
save
that
of
the
said
baron
of
bradwardine
who
is
in
presence
ready
and
willing
to
perform
the
same
it
shall
in
no
wise
impinge
upon
or
prejudice
the
right
of
the
said
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
to
perform
the
said
service
in
future
nor
shall
it
give
any
esquire
valet
of
the
chamber
squire
or
page
whose
assistance
it
may
please
his
royal
highness
to
employ
any
right
title
or
ground
for
evicting
from
the
said
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
the
estate
and
barony
of
bradwardine
and
others
held
as
aforesaid
by
the
due
and
faithful
performance
thereof
fergus
highly
applauded
this
arrangement
and
the
baron
took
a
friendly
leave
of
them
with
a
smile
of
contented
importance
upon
his
visage
live
our
dear
friend
the
baron
exclaimed
the
chief
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
hearing
the
most
absurd
original
that
exists
north
of
the
tweed
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
recommended
him
to
attend
the
circle
this
evening
with
a
under
his
arm
i
think
he
might
have
adopted
the
suggestion
if
it
had
been
made
with
suitable
gravity
how
can
you
take
pleasure
in
making
a
man
of
his
worth
so
ridiculous
pardon
my
dear
waverley
you
are
as
ridiculous
as
he
why
do
you
not
see
that
the
man
whole
mind
is
wrapped
up
in
this
ceremony
he
has
heard
and
thought
of
it
since
infancy
as
the
most
august
privilege
and
ceremony
in
the
world
and
i
doubt
not
but
the
expected
pleasure
of
performing
it
was
a
principal
motive
with
him
for
taking
up
arms
depend
upon
it
had
i
endeavoured
to
divert
him
from
exposing
himself
he
would
have
treated
me
as
an
ignorant
conceited
coxcomb
or
perhaps
might
have
taken
a
fancy
to
cut
my
throat
a
pleasure
which
he
once
proposed
to
himself
upon
some
point
of
etiquette
not
half
so
important
in
his
eyes
as
this
matter
of
boots
or
brogues
or
whatever
the
caliga
shall
finally
be
pronounced
by
the
learned
but
i
must
go
to
headquarters
to
prepare
the
prince
for
this
extraordinary
scene
my
information
will
be
well
taken
for
it
will
give
him
a
hearty
laugh
at
present
and
put
him
on
his
guard
against
laughing
when
it
might
be
very
so
au
revoir
my
dear
waverley
chapter
xlix
the
english
prisoner
the
first
occupation
of
waverley
after
he
departed
from
the
chieftain
was
to
go
in
quest
of
the
officer
whose
life
he
had
saved
he
was
guarded
along
with
his
companions
in
misfortune
who
were
very
numerous
in
a
gentleman
house
near
the
field
of
battle
on
entering
the
room
where
they
stood
crowded
together
waverley
easily
recognised
the
object
of
his
visit
not
only
by
the
peculiar
dignity
of
his
appearance
but
by
the
appendage
of
dugald
mahony
with
his
battleaxe
who
had
stuck
to
him
from
the
moment
of
his
captivity
as
if
he
had
been
skewered
to
his
side
this
close
attendance
was
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
securing
his
promised
reward
from
edward
but
it
also
operated
to
save
the
english
gentleman
from
being
plundered
in
the
scene
of
general
confusion
for
dugald
sagaciously
argued
that
the
amount
of
the
salvage
which
he
might
be
allowed
would
be
regulated
by
the
state
of
the
prisoner
when
he
should
deliver
him
over
to
waverley
he
hastened
to
assure
waverley
therefore
with
more
words
than
he
usually
employed
that
he
had
ta
sidier
roy
haill
and
that
he
wasna
a
plack
the
waur
since
the
fery
moment
when
his
honour
forbad
her
to
gie
him
a
bit
clamhewit
wi
her
axe
waverley
assured
dugald
of
a
liberal
recompense
and
approaching
the
english
officer
expressed
his
anxiety
to
do
anything
which
might
contribute
to
his
convenience
under
his
present
unpleasant
circumstances
am
not
so
inexperienced
a
soldier
sir
answered
the
englishman
to
complain
of
the
fortune
of
war
i
am
only
grieved
to
see
those
scenes
acted
in
our
own
island
which
i
have
often
witnessed
elsewhere
with
comparative
indifference
such
day
as
this
said
waverley
i
trust
the
cause
of
your
regrets
will
be
removed
and
all
will
again
return
to
peace
and
order
the
officer
smiled
and
shook
his
head
must
not
forget
my
situation
so
far
as
to
attempt
a
formal
confutation
of
that
opinion
but
notwithstanding
your
success
and
the
valour
which
achieved
it
you
have
undertaken
a
task
to
which
your
strength
appears
wholly
inadequate
at
this
moment
fergus
pushed
into
the
press
edward
come
along
the
prince
has
gone
to
pinkie
house
for
the
night
and
we
must
follow
or
lose
the
whole
ceremony
of
the
caligae
your
friend
the
baron
has
been
guilty
of
a
great
piece
of
cruelty
he
has
insisted
upon
dragging
bailie
macwheeble
out
to
the
field
of
battle
now
you
must
know
the
bailie
greatest
horror
is
an
armed
highlander
or
a
loaded
gun
and
there
he
stands
listening
to
the
baron
instructions
concerning
the
protest
ducking
his
head
like
a
at
the
report
of
every
gun
and
pistol
that
our
idle
boys
are
firing
upon
the
fields
and
undergoing
by
way
of
penance
at
every
symptom
of
flinching
a
severe
rebuke
from
his
patron
who
would
not
admit
the
discharge
of
a
whole
battery
of
cannon
within
distance
as
an
apology
for
neglecting
a
discourse
in
which
the
honour
of
his
family
is
interested
how
has
bradwardine
got
him
to
venture
so
far
said
edward
he
had
come
as
far
as
musselburgh
i
fancy
in
hopes
of
making
some
of
our
wills
and
the
peremptory
commands
of
the
baron
dragged
him
forward
to
preston
after
the
battle
was
over
he
complains
of
one
or
two
of
our
ragamuffins
having
put
him
in
peril
of
his
life
by
presenting
their
pieces
at
him
but
as
they
limited
his
ransom
to
an
english
penny
i
do
think
we
need
trouble
the
upon
that
subject
so
come
along
waverley
said
the
english
officer
with
great
emotion
the
nephew
of
sir
everard
waverley
of
shire
same
sir
replied
our
hero
somewhat
surprised
at
the
tone
in
which
he
was
addressed
am
at
once
happy
and
grieved
said
the
prisoner
have
met
with
you
am
ignorant
sir
answered
waverley
i
have
deserved
so
much
interest
your
uncle
never
mention
a
friend
called
talbot
have
heard
him
talk
with
great
regard
of
such
a
person
replied
edward
colonel
i
believe
in
the
army
and
the
husband
of
lady
emily
blandeville
but
i
thought
colonel
talbot
had
been
abroad
am
just
returned
answered
the
officer
being
in
scotland
thought
it
my
duty
to
act
where
my
services
promised
to
be
useful
yes
waverley
i
am
that
colonel
talbot
the
husband
of
the
lady
you
have
named
and
i
am
proud
to
acknowledge
that
i
owe
alike
my
professional
rank
and
my
domestic
happiness
to
your
generous
and
relative
good
god
that
i
should
find
his
nephew
in
such
a
dress
and
engaged
in
such
a
cause
said
fergus
haughtily
dress
and
cause
are
those
of
men
of
birth
and
honour
situation
forbids
me
to
dispute
your
assertion
said
colonel
talbot
it
were
no
difficult
matter
to
show
that
neither
courage
nor
pride
of
lineage
can
gild
a
bad
cause
but
with
waverley
permission
and
yours
sir
if
yours
also
must
be
asked
i
would
willingly
speak
a
few
words
with
him
on
affairs
connected
with
his
own
family
waverley
sir
regulates
his
own
motions
you
will
follow
me
i
suppose
to
pinkie
said
fergus
turning
to
edward
you
have
finished
your
discourse
with
this
new
acquaintance
so
saying
the
chief
of
glennaquoich
adjusted
his
plaid
with
rather
more
than
his
usual
air
of
haughty
assumption
and
left
the
apartment
the
interest
of
waverley
readily
procured
for
colonel
talbot
the
freedom
of
adjourning
to
a
large
garden
belonging
to
his
place
of
confinement
they
walked
a
few
paces
in
silence
colonel
talbot
apparently
studying
how
to
open
what
he
had
to
say
at
length
he
addressed
edward
waverley
you
have
this
day
saved
my
life
and
yet
i
would
to
god
that
i
had
lost
it
ere
i
had
found
you
wearing
the
uniform
and
cockade
of
these
men
forgive
your
reproach
colonel
talbot
it
is
well
meant
and
your
education
and
prejudices
render
it
natural
but
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
finding
a
man
whose
honour
has
been
publicly
and
unjustly
assailed
in
the
situation
which
promised
most
fair
to
afford
him
satisfaction
on
his
calumniators
should
rather
say
in
the
situation
most
likely
to
confirm
the
reports
which
they
have
circulated
said
colonel
talbot
following
the
very
line
of
conduct
ascribed
to
you
are
you
aware
waverley
of
the
infinite
distress
and
even
danger
which
your
present
conduct
has
occasioned
to
your
nearest
relatives
sir
danger
when
i
left
england
your
uncle
and
father
had
been
obliged
to
find
bail
to
answer
a
charge
of
treason
to
which
they
were
only
admitted
by
the
exertion
of
the
most
powerful
interest
i
came
down
to
scotland
with
the
sole
purpose
of
rescuing
you
from
the
gulf
into
which
you
have
precipitated
yourself
nor
can
i
estimate
the
consequences
to
your
family
of
your
having
openly
joined
the
rebellion
since
the
very
suspicion
of
your
intention
was
so
perilous
to
them
most
deeply
do
i
regret
that
i
did
not
meet
you
before
this
last
and
fatal
error
am
really
ignorant
said
waverley
in
a
tone
of
reserve
colonel
talbot
should
have
taken
so
much
trouble
on
my
account
waverley
answered
talbot
am
dull
at
apprehending
irony
and
therefore
i
shall
answer
your
words
according
to
their
plain
meaning
i
am
indebted
to
your
uncle
for
benefits
greater
than
those
which
a
son
owes
to
a
father
i
acknowledge
to
him
the
duty
of
a
son
and
as
i
know
there
is
no
manner
in
which
i
can
requite
his
kindness
so
well
as
by
serving
you
i
will
serve
you
if
possible
whether
you
will
permit
me
or
no
the
personal
obligation
which
you
have
this
day
laid
me
under
although
in
common
estimation
as
great
as
one
human
being
can
bestow
on
another
adds
nothing
to
my
zeal
on
your
behalf
nor
can
that
zeal
be
abated
by
any
coolness
with
which
you
may
please
to
receive
it
intentions
may
be
kind
sir
said
waverley
drily
your
language
is
harsh
or
at
least
peremptory
my
return
to
england
continued
colonel
talbot
long
absence
i
found
your
uncle
sir
everard
waverley
in
the
custody
of
a
king
messenger
in
consequence
of
the
suspicion
brought
upon
him
by
your
conduct
he
is
my
oldest
friend
how
often
shall
i
repeat
it
my
best
benefactor
he
sacrificed
his
own
views
of
happiness
to
mine
he
never
uttered
a
word
he
never
harboured
a
thought
that
benevolence
itself
might
not
have
thought
or
spoken
i
found
this
man
in
confinement
rendered
harsher
to
him
by
his
habits
of
life
his
natural
dignity
of
feeling
and
forgive
me
waverley
by
the
cause
through
which
this
calamity
had
come
upon
him
i
can
not
disguise
from
you
my
feelings
upon
this
occasion
they
were
most
painfully
unfavorable
to
you
having
by
my
family
interest
which
you
probably
know
is
not
inconsiderable
succeeded
in
obtaining
sir
everard
release
i
set
out
for
scotland
i
saw
colonel
gardiner
a
man
whose
fate
alone
is
sufficient
to
render
this
insurrection
for
ever
execrable
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
him
i
found
that
from
late
circumstances
from
a
reexamination
of
the
persons
engaged
in
the
mutiny
and
from
his
original
good
opinion
of
your
character
he
was
much
softened
towards
you
and
i
doubted
not
that
if
i
could
be
so
fortunate
as
to
discover
you
all
might
yet
be
well
but
this
unnatural
rebellion
has
ruined
all
i
have
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
and
active
military
life
seen
britons
disgrace
themselves
by
a
panic
flight
and
that
before
a
foe
without
either
arms
or
discipline
and
now
i
find
the
heir
of
my
dearest
friend
the
son
i
may
say
of
his
affections
sharing
a
triumph
for
which
he
ought
the
first
to
have
blushed
why
should
i
lament
gardiner
his
lot
was
happy
compared
to
mine
there
was
so
much
dignity
in
colonel
talbot
manner
such
a
mixture
of
military
pride
and
manly
sorrow
and
the
news
of
sir
everard
imprisonment
was
told
in
so
deep
a
tone
of
feeling
that
edward
stood
mortified
abashed
and
distressed
in
presence
of
the
prisoner
who
owed
to
him
his
life
not
many
hours
before
he
was
not
sorry
when
fergus
interrupted
their
conference
a
second
time
royal
highness
commands
waverley
attendance
colonel
talbot
threw
upon
edward
a
reproachful
glance
which
did
not
escape
the
quick
eye
of
the
highland
chief
immediate
attendance
he
repeated
with
considerable
emphasis
waverley
turned
again
towards
the
colonel

meet
again
he
said
the
meanwhile
every
possible
accommodation

the
colonel

like
the
meanest
of
those
brave
men
who
on
this
day
of
calamity
have
preferred
wounds
and
captivity
to
flight
i
would
almost
exchange
places
with
one
of
those
who
have
fallen
to
know
that
my
words
have
made
a
suitable
impression
on
your
mind

the
highland

the

importance

him

no
accommodation

his
rank
said
waverley
always
with
secure
custody
reiterated
fergus
the
officer
signified
his
acquiescence
in
both
commands
and
edward
followed
fergus
to
the

callum

awaited
them
turning
his
head
he
saw
colonel
talbot
reconducted
to
his
place
of
confinement
by
a
file
of
highlanders
he
lingered
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
made
a
signal
with
his
hand
towards
waverley
as
if
enforcing
the
language
he
had
held
towards
him

fergus

he
mounted
now

their
enemies
at

at
this
critical

assure
thyself
that
either
they
have
no
charge
against
your

which
they
can
continue

they
are

account
and
we
will
find
some
means
of
conveying
to

assurances
of
your
safety
edward
was
silenced
but
not
satisfied
with
these
reasons
he
had
now
been
more
than
once
shocked
at
the
small
degree
of
sympathy
which
fergus
exhibited
for
the
feelings
even
of
those
whom
he
loved
if
they
did
not
correspond
with
his
own
mood
at
the
time
and
more
especially
if
they
thwarted
him
while
earnest
in
a
favourite
pursuit
fergus
sometimes
indeed
observed
that
he
had
offended
waverley
but
always
intent
upon
some
favourite
plan
or
project
of
his
own
he
was
never
sufficiently
aware
of
the
extent
or
duration
of
his
displeasure
so
that
the
reiteration
of
these
petty
offences
somewhat
cooled
the
volunteer
extreme
attachment
to
his
officer
the
chevalier
received
waverley
with
his
usual
favour
and
paid
him
many
compliments
on
his
distinguished
bravery
he
then
took
him
apart
made
many
inquiries
concerning
colonel
talbot
and
when
he
had
received
all
the
information
which
edward
was
able
to
give
concerning
him
and
his
connexions
he
proceeded
can
not
but
think
waverley
that
since
this
gentleman
is
so
particularly
connected
with
our
worthy
and
excellent
friend
sir
everard
waverley
and
since
his
lady
is
of
the
house
of
blandeville
whose
devotion
to
the
true
and
loyal
principles
of
the
church
of
england
is
so
generally
known
the
colonel
own
private
sentiments
can
not
be
unfavorable
to
us
whatever
mask
he
may
have
assumed
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
times
i
am
to
judge
from
the
language
he
this
day
held
to
me
i
am
under
the
necessity
of
differing
widely
from
your
royal
highness
it
is
worth
making
a
trial
at
least
i
therefore
entrust
you
with
the
charge
of
colonel
talbot
with
power
to
act
concerning
him
as
you
think
most
advisable
and
i
hope
you
will
find
means
of
ascertaining
what
are
his
real
dispositions
towards
our
royal
father
restoration
am
convinced
said
waverley
bowing
if
colonel
talbot
chooses
to
grant
his
parole
it
may
be
securely
depended
upon
but
if
he
refuses
it
i
trust
your
royal
highness
will
devolve
on
some
other
person
than
the
nephew
of
his
friend
the
task
of
laying
him
under
the
necessary
restraint
will
trust
him
with
no
person
but
you
said
the
prince
smiling
but
peremptorily
repeating
his
mandate
is
of
importance
to
my
service
that
there
should
appear
to
be
a
good
intelligence
between
you
even
if
you
are
unable
to
gain
his
confidence
in
earnest
you
will
therefore
receive
him
into
your
quarters
and
in
case
he
declines
giving
his
parole
you
must
apply
for
a
proper
guard
i
beg
you
will
go
about
this
directly
we
return
to
edinburgh
tomorrow
being
thus
remanded
to
the
vicinity
of
preston
waverley
lost
the
baron
of
bradwardine
solemn
act
of
homage
so
little
however
was
he
at
this
time
in
love
with
vanity
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
the
ceremony
in
which
fergus
had
laboured
to
engage
his
curiosity
but
next
day
a
formal
was
circulated
containing
a
detailed
account
of
the
battle
of
gladsmuir
as
the
highlanders
chose
to
denominate
their
victory
it
concluded
with
an
account
of
the
court
afterwards
held
by
the
chevalier
at
pinkie
house
which
contained
this
among
other
descriptive
paragraphs
that
fatal
treaty
which
annihilates
scotland
as
an
independent
nation
it
has
not
been
our
happiness
to
see
her
princes
receive
and
her
nobles
discharge
those
acts
of
feudal
homage
which
founded
upon
the
splendid
actions
of
scottish
valour
recall
the
memory
of
her
early
history
with
the
manly
and
chivalrous
simplicity
of
the
ties
which
united
to
the
crown
the
homage
of
the
warriors
by
whom
it
was
repeatedly
upheld
and
defended
but
on
the
evening
of
the
our
memories
were
refreshed
with
one
of
those
ceremonies
which
belong
to
the
ancient
days
of
scotland
glory
after
the
circle
was
formed
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
of
that
ilk
colonel
in
the
service
came
before
the
prince
attended
by
macwheeble
the
bailie
of
his
ancient
barony
of
bradwardine
who
we
understand
has
been
lately
named
a
commissary
and
under
form
of
instrument
claimed
permission
to
perform
to
the
person
of
his
royal
highness
as
representing
his
father
the
service
used
and
wont
for
which
under
a
charter
of
robert
bruce
of
which
the
original
was
produced
and
inspected
by
the
masters
of
his
royal
highness
chancery
for
the
time
being
the
claimant
held
the
barony
of
bradwardine
and
lands
of
his
claim
being
admitted
and
registered
his
royal
highness
having
placed
his
foot
upon
a
cushion
the
baron
of
bradwardine
kneeling
upon
his
right
knee
proceeded
to
undo
the
latchet
of
the
brogue
or
highland
shoe
which
our
gallant
young
hero
wears
in
compliment
to
his
brave
followers
when
this
was
performed
his
royal
highness
declared
the
ceremony
completed
and
embracing
the
gallant
veteran
protested
that
nothing
but
compliance
with
an
ordinance
of
robert
bruce
could
have
induced
him
to
receive
even
the
symbolical
performance
of
a
menial
office
from
hands
which
had
fought
so
bravely
to
put
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
his
father
the
baron
of
bradwardine
then
took
instruments
in
the
hands
of
commissary
macwheeble
bearing
that
all
points
and
circumstances
of
the
act
of
homage
had
been
rite
et
solenniter
acta
et
peracta
and
a
corresponding
entry
was
made
in
the
protocol
of
the
lord
high
chamberlain
and
in
the
record
of
chancery
we
understand
that
it
is
in
contemplation
of
his
royal
highness
when
his
pleasure
can
be
known
to
raise
colonel
bradwardine
to
the
peerage
by
the
title
of
viscount
bradwardine
of
bradwardine
and
and
that
in
the
meanwhile
his
royal
highness
in
his
father
name
and
authority
has
been
pleased
to
grant
him
an
honourable
augmentation
to
his
paternal
coat
of
arms
being
a
budget
or
disposed
with
a
naked
broadsword
to
be
borne
in
the
dexter
cantle
of
the
shield
and
as
an
additional
motto
on
a
scroll
beneath
the
words
draw
and
draw
off
it
not
for
the
recollection
of
fergus
raillery
thought
waverley
to
himself
when
he
had
perused
this
long
and
grave
document
how
very
tolerably
would
all
this
sound
and
how
little
should
i
have
thought
of
connecting
it
with
any
ludicrous
idea
well
after
all
everything
has
its
fair
as
well
as
its
seamy
side
and
truly
i
do
not
see
why
the
baron
may
not
stand
as
fair
in
heraldry
as
the
waggons
wheels
shuttles
candlesticks
and
other
ordinaries
conveying
ideas
of
anything
save
chivalry
which
appear
in
the
arms
of
some
of
our
most
ancient
gentry
this
however
is
an
episode
in
respect
to
the
principal
story
when
waverley
returned
to
preston
and
rejoined
colonel
talbot
he
found
him
recovered
from
the
strong
and
obvious
emotions
with
which
a
concurrence
of
unpleasing
events
had
affected
him
he
had
regained
his
natural
manner
which
was
that
of
an
english
gentleman
and
soldier
manly
open
and
generous
but
not
unsusceptible
of
prejudice
against
those
of
a
different
country
or
who
opposed
him
in
political
tenets
when
waverley
acquainted
colonel
talbot
with
the
chevalier
purpose
to
commit

not
think
to
have
owed
so
much
obligation
to
that
young
gentleman
he
said

implied
in
this
destination
i
can
at
least
cheerfully
join
in
the
prayer
of
the
honest
presbyterian
clergyman
that
as
he
has
come
among
us
seeking
an
earthly
crown
his
labours
may
be
speedily
rewarded
with
a
heavenly
one

the
clergyman
name
was
protected
by

cannon
of

castle
he
preached
every
sunday
in
the
west
kirk
while
the
highlanders
were
in
possession
of
edinburgh
and
it
was
in
presence
of
some
of
the
jacobites

he
prayed
for
prince

in
the
terms
quoted
in

i
shall
willingly
give
my
parole
not
to
attempt
an
escape
without
your
knowledge
since
in
fact
it
was
to
meet
you
that
i
came
to
scotland
and
i
am
glad
it
has
happened
even
under
this
predicament
but
i
suppose
we
shall
be
but
a
short
time
together
your
chevalier
that
is
a
name
we
may
both
give
to
him
with
his
plaids
and
blue
caps
will
i
presume
be
continuing
his
crusade
southward
as
i
hear
i
believe
the
army
makes
some
stay
in
edinburgh
to
collect
reinforcements
to
besiege
the
castle
said
talbot
smiling
sarcastically
unless
my
old
commander
general
preston
turn
false
metal
or
the
castle
sink
into
the
north
loch
events
which
i
deem
equally
probable
i
think
we
shall
have
some
time
to
make
up
our
acquaintance
i
have
a
guess
that
this
gallant
chevalier
has
a
design
that
i
should
be
your
proselyte
and
as
i
wish
you
to
be
mine
there
can
not
be
a
more
fair
proposal
than
to
afford
us
fair
conference
together
but
as
i
spoke
today
under
the
influence
of
feelings
i
rarely
give
way
to
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
entering
again
upon
controversy

we
are

acquainted

the

entrance
of
the
chevalier
into
edinburgh
after

decisive
affair
at

one
circumstance
however
may
be
noticed
because
it
illustrates
the
high
spirit
of

the
highlanders
by
whom
the

was
surrounded

the
license
and
extravagance
of

joyful
moment

fergus
who
beheld
the
accident
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
and
on
seeing
that
the
wound
was
trifling
he
drew
his
broadsword
with
the
purpose
of
rushing
down
upon
the
man
by
whose
carelessness
she
had
incurred
so
much
danger
when
holding
him
by
the
plaid

the
poor
fellow
she
cried
heaven
sake
do
not
harm
him
but
thank
god
with
me
that
the
accident
happened
to
flora
for
had
it
befallen
a
whig
they
would
have
pretended
that
the
shot
was
fired
on
purpose
waverley
escaped
the
alarm
which
this
accident
would
have
occasioned
to
him
as
he
was
unavoidably
delayed
by
the
necessity
of
accompanying
colonel
talbot
to
edinburgh
they
performed
the
journey
together
on
horseback
and
for
some
time
as
if
to
sound
each
other
feelings
and
sentiments
they
conversed
upon
general
and
ordinary
topics
when
waverley
again
entered
upon
the
subject
which
he
had
most
at
heart
the
situation
namely
of
his
father
and
his
uncle
colonel
talbot
seemed
now
rather
desirous
to
alleviate
than
to
aggravate
his
anxiety
this
appeared
particularly
to
be
the
case
when
he
heard
waverley
history
which
he
did
not
scruple
to
confide
to
him
so
said
the
colonel
has
been
no
malice
prepense
as
lawyers
i
think
term
it
in
this
rash
step
of
yours
and
you
have
been
trepanned
into
the
service
of
this
italian
by
a
few
civil
speeches
from
him
and
one
or
two
of
his
highland
recruiting
sergeants
it
is
sadly
foolish
to
be
sure
but
not
nearly
so
bad
as
i
was
led
to
expect
however
you
can
not
desert
even
from
the
pretender
at
the
present
moment
that
seems
impossible
but
i
have
little
doubt
that
in
the
dissensions
incident
to
this
heterogeneous
mass
of
wild
and
desperate
men
some
opportunity
may
arise
by
availing
yourself
of
which
you
may
extricate
yourself
honourably
from
your
rash
engagement
before
the
bubble
burst
if
this
can
be
managed
i
would
have
you
go
to
a
place
of
safety
in
flanders
which
i
shall
point
out
and
i
think
i
can
secure
your
pardon
from
government
after
a
few
residence
abroad
can
not
permit
you
colonel
talbot
answered
waverley
speak
of
any
plan
which
turns
on
my
deserting
an
enterprise
in
which
i
may
have
engaged
hastily
but
certainly
voluntarily
and
with
the
purpose
of
abiding
the
issue
said
colonel
talbot
smiling
me
my
thoughts
and
hopes
at
least
at
liberty
if
not
my
speech
but
have
you
never
examined
your
mysterious
packet
is
in
my
baggage
replied
edward
shall
find
it
in
edinburgh
in
edinburgh
they
soon
arrived
waverley
quarters
had
been
assigned
to
him
by
the
prince
express
orders
in
a
handsome
lodging
where
there
was
accommodation
for
colonel
talbot
his
first
business
was
to
examine
his
portmanteau
and
after
a
very
short
search
out
tumbled
the
expected
packet
waverley
opened
it
eagerly
under
a
blank
cover
simply
addressed
to
waverley
he
found
a
number
of
open
letters
the
uppermost
were
two
from
colonel
gardiner
addressed
to
himself
the
earliest
in
date
was
a
kind
and
gentle
remonstrance
for
neglect
of
the
advice
respecting
the
disposal
of
his
time
during
his
leave
of
absence
the
renewal
of
which
he
reminded
captain
waverley
would
speedily
expire
the
letter
proceeded
it
been
otherwise
the
news
from
abroad
and
my
instructions
from
the
war
office
must
have
compelled
me
to
recall
it
as
there
is
great
danger
since
the
disaster
in
flanders
both
of
foreign
invasion
and
insurrection
among
the
disaffected
at
home
i
therefore
entreat
you
will
repair
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
headquarters
of
the
regiment
and
i
am
concerned
to
add
that
this
is
still
the
more
necessary
as
there
is
some
discontent
in
your
troop
and
i
postpone
inquiry
into
particulars
until
i
can
have
the
advantage
of
your
assistance
the
second
letter
dated
eight
days
later
was
in
such
a
style
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
colonel
receiving
no
answer
to
the
first
it
reminded
waverley
of
his
duty
as
a
man
of
honour
an
officer
and
a
briton
took
notice
of
the
increasing
dissatisfaction
of
his
men
and
that
some
of
them
had
been
heard
to
hint
that
their
captain
encouraged
and
approved
of
their
mutinous
behaviour
and
finally
the
writer
expressed
the
utmost
regret
and
surprise
that
he
had
not
obeyed
his
commands
by
repairing
to
headquarters
reminded
him
that
his
leave
of
absence
had
been
recalled
and
conjured
him
in
a
style
in
which
paternal
remonstrance
was
mingled
with
military
authority
to
redeem
his
error
by
immediately
joining
his
regiment
i
may
be
certain
concluded
the
letter
this
actually
reaches
you
i
despatch
it
by
corporal
tims
of
your
troop
with
orders
to
deliver
it
into
your
own
hand
upon
reading
these
letters
waverley
with
great
bitterness
of
feeling
was
compelled
to
make
the
amende
honorable
to
the
memory
of
the
brave
and
excellent
writer
for
surely
as
colonel
gardiner
must
have
had
every
reason
to
conclude
they
had
come
safely
to
hand
less
could
not
follow
on
their
being
neglected
than
that
third
and
final
summons
which
waverley
actually
received
at
glennaquoich
though
too
late
to
obey
it
and
his
being
superseded
in
consequence
of
his
apparent
neglect
of
this
last
command
was
so
far
from
being
a
harsh
or
severe
proceeding
that
it
was
plainly
inevitable
the
next
letter
he
unfolded
was
from
the
major
of
the
regiment
acquainting
him
that
a
report
to
the
disadvantage
of
his
reputation
was
public
in
the
country
stating
that
one
falconer
of
ballihopple
or
some
such
name
had
proposed
in
his
presence
a
treasonable
toast
which
he
permitted
to
pass
in
silence
although
it
was
so
gross
an
affront
to
the
royal
family
that
a
gentleman
in
company
not
remarkable
for
his
zeal
for
government
had
never
theless
taken
the
matter
up
and
that
supposing
the
account
true
captain
waverley
had
thus
suffered
another
comparatively
unconcerned
to
resent
an
affront
directed
against
him
personally
as
an
officer
and
to
go
out
with
the
person
by
whom
it
was
offered
the
major
concluded
that
no
one
of
captain
waverley
brother
officers
could
believe
this
scandalous
story
but
that
it
was
necessarily
their
joint
opinion
that
his
own
honour
equally
with
that
of
the
regiment
depended
upon
its
being
instantly
contradicted
by
his
authority
etc
etc
etc
do
you
think
of
all
this
said
colonel
talbot
to
whom
waverley
handed
the
letters
after
he
had
perused
them
it
renders
thought
impossible
it
is
enough
to
drive
me
mad
calm
my
young
friend
let
us
see
what
are
these
dirty
scrawls
that
follow
the
first
was
addressed

ruffin
i
suppose
then
is
your
donald
of
the
cavern
who
has
intercepted
your
letters
and
carried
on
a
correspondence
with
the
poor
devil
houghton
as
if
under
your
authority
seems
too
true
but
who
can
addem
be
adam
for
poor
gardiner
a
sort
of
pun
on
his
name
the
other
letters
were
to
the
same
purpose
and
they
soon
received
yet
more
complete
light
upon
donald
bean
machinations
john
hodges
one
of
waverley
servants
who
had
remained
with
the
regiment
and
had
been
taken
at
preston
now
made
his
appearance
he
had
sought
out
his
master
with
the
purpose
of
again
entering
his
service
from
this
fellow
they
learned
that
some
time
after
waverley
had
gone
from
the
headquarters
of
the
regiment
a
pedlar
called
ruthven
rufnn
or
rivane
known
among
the
soldiers
by
the
name
of
wily
will
had
made
frequent
visits
to
the
town
of
dundee
he
appeared
to
possess
plenty
of
money
sold
his
commodities
very
cheap
seemed
always
willing
to
treat
his
friends
at
the
house
and
easily
ingratiated
himself
with
many
of
troop
particularly
sergeant
houghton
and
one
tims
also
a
commissioned
officer
to
these
he
unfolded
in
waverley
name
a
plan
for
leaving
the
regiment
and
joining
him
in
the
highlands
where
report
said
the
clans
had
already
taken
arms
in
great
numbers
the
men
who
had
been
educated
as
jacobites
so
far
as
they
had
any
opinion
at
all
and
who
knew
their
landlord
sir
everard
had
always
been
supposed
to
hold
such
tenets
easily
fell
into
the
snare
that
waverley
was
at
a
distance
in
the
highlands
was
received
as
a
sufficient
excuse
for
transmitting
his
letters
through
the
medium
of
the
pedlar
and
the
sight
of
his
seal
seemed
to
authenticate
the
negotiations
in
his
name
where
writing
might
have
been
dangerous
the
cabal
however
began
to
take
air
from
the
premature
mutinous
language
of
those
concerned
wily
will
justified
his
appellative
for
after
suspicion
arose
he
was
seen
no
more
when
the
appeared
in
which
waverley
was
superseded
great
part
of
his
troop
broke
out
into
actual
mutiny
but
were
surrounded
and
disarmed
by
the
rest
of
the
regiment
in
consequence
of
the
sentence
of
a
houghton
and
tims
were
condemned
to
be
shot
but
afterwards
permitted
to
cast
lots
for
life
houghton
the
survivor
showed
much
penitence
being
convinced
from
the
rebukes
and
explanations
of
colonel
gardiner
that
he
had
really
engaged
in
a
very
heinous
crime
it
is
remarkable
that
as
soon
as
the
poor
fellow
was
satisfied
of
this
he
became
also
convinced
that
the
instigator
had
acted
without
authority
from
edward
saying
it
was
dishonourable
and
against
old
england
the
squire
could
know
nought
about
it
he
never
did
or
thought
to
do
anything
dishonourable
no
more
did
sir
everard
nor
none
of
them
afore
him
and
in
that
belief
he
would
live
and
die
that
ruffin
had
done
it
all
of
his
own
head
the
strength
of
conviction
with
which
he
expressed
himself
upon
this
subject
as
well
as
his
assurances
that
the
letters
intended
for
waverley
had
been
delivered
to
ruthven
made
that
revolution
in
colonel
gardiner
opinion
which
he
expressed
to
talbot
the
reader
has
long
since
understood
that
donald
bean
lean
played
the
part
of
tempter
on
this
occasion
his
motives
were
shortly
these
of
an
active
and
intriguing
spirit
he
had
been
long
employed
as
a
subaltern
agent
and
spy
by
those
in
the
confidence
of
the
chevalier
to
an
extent
beyond
what
was
suspected
even
by
fergus
whom
though
obliged
to
him
for
protection
he
regarded
with
fear
and
dislike
to
success
in
this
political
department
he
naturally
looked
for
raising
himself
by
some
bold
stroke
above
his
present
hazardous
and
precarious
trade
of
rapine
he
was
particularly
employed
in
learning
the
strength
of
the
regiments
in
scotland
the
character
of
the
officers
and
had
long
had
his
eye
upon
waverley
troop
as
open
to
temptation
donald
even
believed
that
waverley
himself
was
at
bottom
in
the
stuart
interest
which
seemed
confirmed
by
his
long
visit
to
the
jacobite
baron
of
bradwardine
when
therefore
he
came
to
his
cave
with
one
of
glennaquoich
attendants
the
robber
who
could
never
appreciate
his
real
motive
which
was
mere
curiosity
was
so
sanguine
as
to
hope
that
his
own
talents
were
to
be
employed
in
some
intrigue
of
consequence
under
the
auspices
of
this
wealthy
young
englishman
nor
was
he
undeceived
by
waverley
neglecting
all
hints
and
openings
afforded
for
explanation
his
conduct
passed
for
prudent
reserve
and
somewhat
piqued
donald
bean
who
supposing
himself
left
out
of
a
secret
where
confidence
promised
to
be
advantageous
determined
to
have
his
share
in
the
drama
whether
a
regular
part
were
assigned
him
or
not
for
this
purpose
during
waverley
sleep
he
possessed
himself
of
his
seal
as
a
token
to
be
used
to
any
of
the
troopers
whom
he
might
discover
to
be
possessed
of
the
captain
confidence
his
first
journey
to
dundee
the
town
where
the
regiment
was
quartered
undeceived
him
in
his
original
supposition
but
opened
to
him
a
new
field
of
action
he
knew
there
would
be
no
service
so
well
rewarded
by
the
friends
of
the
chevalier
as
seducing
a
part
of
the
regular
army
to
his
standard
for
this
purpose
he
opened
the
machinations
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
and
which
form
a
clue
to
all
the
intricacies
and
obscurities
of
the
narrative
previous
to
waverley
leaving
glennaquoich
by
colonel
talbot
advice
waverley
declined
detaining
in
his
service
the
lad
whose
evidence
had
thrown
additional
light
on
these
intrigues
he
represented
to
him
that
it
would
be
doing
the
man
an
injury
to
engage
him
in
a
desperate
undertaking
and
that
whatever
should
happen
his
evidence
would
go
some
length
at
least
in
explaining
the
circumstances
under
which
waverley
himself
had
embarked
in
it
waverley
therefore
wrote
a
short
state
of
what
had
happened
to
his
uncle
and
his
father
cautioning
them
however
in
the
present
circumstances
not
to
attempt
to
answer
his
letter
talbot
then
gave
the
young
man
a
letter
to
the
commander
of
one
of
the
english
vessels
of
war
cruising
in
the
frith
requesting
him
to
put
the
bearer
ashore
at
berwick
with
a
pass
to
proceed
to
shire
he
was
then

hired
as
a
servant
a
simple
edinburgh
swain
who
had
mounted
the

cockade

a

and

colonel
talbot
became
more
kindly
in
his
demeanour
towards
waverley
after
the
confidence
he
had
reposed
in
him
and
as
they
were
necessarily
much
together
the
character
of
the
colonel
rose
in
waverley
estimation
there
seemed
at
first
something
harsh
in
his
strong
expressions
of
dislike
and
censure
although
no
one
was
in
the
general
case
more
open
to
conviction
the
habit
of
authority
had
also
given
his
manners
some
peremptory
hardness
notwithstanding
the
polish
which
they
had
received
from
his
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
higher
circles
as
a
specimen
of
the
military
character
he
differed
from
all
whom
waverley
had
as
yet
seen
the
soldiership
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
was
marked
by
pedantry
that
of
major
melville
by
a
sort
of
martinet
attention
to
the
minutiae
and
technicalities
of
discipline
rather
suitable
to
one
who
was
to
manoeuvre
a
battalion
than
to
him
who
was
to
command
an
army
the
military
spirit
of
fergus
was
so
much
warped
and
blended
with
his
plans
and
political
views
that
it
was
less
that
of
a
soldier
than
of
a
petty
sovereign
but
colonel
talbot
was
in
every
point
the
english
soldier
his
whole
soul
was
devoted
to
the
service
of
his
king
and
country
without
feeling
any
pride
in
knowing
the
theory
of
his
art
with
the
baron
or
its
practical
minutiae
with
the
major
or
in
applying
his
science
to
his
own
particular
plans
of
ambition
like
the
chieftain
of
glennaquoich
added
to
this
he
was
a
man
of
extended
knowledge
and
cultivated
taste
although
strongly
tinged
as
we
have
already
observed
with
those
prejudices
which
are
peculiarly
english
the
character
of
colonel
talbot
dawned
upon
edward
by
degrees
for
the
delay
of
the
highlanders
in
the
fruitless
siege
of
edinburgh
castle
occupied
several
weeks
during
which
waverley
had
little
to
do
excepting
to
seek
such
amusement
as
society
afforded
he
would
willingly
have
persuaded
his
new
friend
to
become
acquainted
with
some
of
his
former
intimates
but
the
colonel
after
one
or
two
visits
shook
his
head
and
declined
farther
experiment
indeed
he
went
farther
and
characterised
the
baron
as
the
most
intolerable
formal
pedant
he
had
ever
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
with
and
the
chief
of
glennaquoich
as
a
frenchified
scotchman
possessing
all
the
cunning
and
plausibility
of
the
nation
where
he
was
educated
with
the
proud
vindictive
and
turbulent
humour
of
that
of
his
birth
the
devil
he
said
sought
out
an
agent
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
embroiling
this
miserable
country
i
do
not
think
he
could
find
a
better
than
such
a
fellow
as
this
whose
temper
seems
equally
active
supple
and
mischievous
and
who
is
followed
and
implicitly
obeyed
by
a
gang
of
such
as
those
whom
you
are
pleased
to
admire
so
much
the
ladies
of
the
party
did
not
escape
his
censure
he
allowed
that
flora
was
a
fine
woman
and
rose
bradwardine
a
pretty
girl
but
he
alleged
that
the
former
destroyed
the
effect
of
her
beauty
by
an
affectation
of
the
grand
airs
which
she
had
probably
seen
practised
in
the
mock
court
of
germains
as
for
rose
bradwardine
he
said
it
was
impossible
for
any
mortal
to
admire
such
a
little
uninformed
thing
whose
small
portion
of
education
was
as
ill
adapted
to
her
sex
or
youth
as
if
she
had
appeared
with
one
of
her
father
old
upon
her
person
for
her
sole
garment
now
much
of
this
was
mere
spleen
and
prejudice
in
the
excellent
colonel
with
whom
the
white
cockade
on
the
breast
the
white
rose
in
the
hair
and
the
mac
at
the
beginning
of
a
name
would
have
made
a
devil
out
of
an
angel
and
indeed
he
himself
jocularly
allowed
that
he
could
not
have
endured
venus
herself
if
she
had
been
announced
in
a
by
the
name
of
miss
waverley
it
may
easily
be
believed
looked
upon
these
young
ladies
with
very
different
eyes
during
the
period
of
the
siege
he
paid
them
almost
daily
visits
although
he
observed
with
regret
that
his
suit
made
as
little
progress
in
the
affections
of
the
former
as
the
arms
of
the
chevalier
in
subduing
the
fortress
she
maintained
with
rigour
the
rule
she
had
laid
down
of
treating
him
with
indifference
without
either
affecting
to
avoid
him
or
to
shun
intercourse
with
him
every
word
every
look
was
strictly
regulated
to
accord
with
her
system
and
neither
the
dejection
of
waverley
nor
the
anger
which
fergus
scarcely
suppressed
could
extend
flora
attention
to
edward
beyond
that
which
the
most
ordinary
politeness
demanded
on
the
other
hand
rose
bradwardine
gradually
rose
in
waverley
opinion
he
had
several
opportunities
of
remarking
that
as
her
extreme
timidity
wore
off
her
manners
assumed
a
higher
character
that
the
agitating
circumstances
of
the
stormy
time
seemed
to
call
forth
a
certain
dignity
of
feeling
and
expression
which
he
had
not
formerly
observed
and
that
she
omitted
no
opportunity
within
her
reach
to
extend
her
knowledge
and
refine
her
taste
flora
called
rose
her
pupil
and
was
attentive
to
assist
her
in
her
studies
and
to
fashion
both
her
taste
and
understanding
it
might
have
been
remarked
by
a
very
close
observer
that
in
the
presence
of
waverley
she
was
much
more
desirous
to
exhibit
her
friend
excellences
than
her
own
but
i
must
request
of
the
reader
to
suppose
that
this
kind
and
disinterested
purpose
was
concealed
by
the
most
cautious
delicacy
studiously
shunning
the
most
distant
approach
to
affectation
so
that
it
was
as
unlike
the
usual
exhibition
of
one
pretty
woman
affecting
to
proner
another
as
the
friendship
of
david
and
jonathan
might
be
to
the
intimacy
of
two
bond
street
loungers
the
fact
is
that
though
the
effect
was
felt
the
cause
could
hardly
be
observed
each
of
the
ladies
like
two
excellent
actresses
were
perfect
in
their
parts
and
performed
them
to
the
delight
of
the
audience
and
such
being
the
case
it
was
almost
impossible
to
discover
that
the
elder
constantly
ceded
to
her
friend
that
which
was
most
suitable
to
her
talents
but
to
waverley
rose
bradwardine
possessed
an
attraction
which
few
men
can
resist
from
the
marked
interest
which
she
took
in
everything
that
affected
him
she
was
too
young
and
too
inexperienced
to
estimate
the
full
force
of
the
constant
attention
which
she
paid
to
him
her
father
was
too
abstractedly
immersed
in
learned
and
military
discussions
to
observe
her
partiality
and
flora
did
not
alarm
her
by
remonstrance
because
she
saw
in
this
line
of
conduct
the
most
probable
chance
of
her
friend
securing
at
length
a
return
of
affection
the
truth
is
that
in
her
first
conversation
after
their
meeting
rose
had
discovered
the
state
of
her
mind
to
that
acute
and
intelligent
friend
although
she
was
not
herself
aware
of
it
from
that
time
flora
was
not
only
determined
upon
the
final
rejection
of
waverley
addresses
but
became
anxious
that
they
should
if
possible
be
transferred
to
her
friend
nor
was
she
less
interested
in
this
plan
though
her
brother
had
from
time
to
time
talked
as
between
jest
and
earnest
of
paying
his
suit
to
miss
bradwardine
she
knew
that
fergus
had
the
true
continental
latitude
of
opinion
respecting
the
institution
of
marriage
and
would
not
have
given
his
hand
to
an
angel
unless
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
his
alliances
and
increasing
his
influence
and
wealth
the
baron
whim
of
transferring
his
estate
to
the
distant
instead
of
his
own
daughter
was
therefore
likely
to
be
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
his
entertaining
any
serious
thoughts
of
rose
bradwardine
indeed
fergus
brain
was
a
perpetual
workshop
of
scheme
and
intrigue
of
every
possible
kind
and
description
while
like
many
a
mechanic
of
more
ingenuity
than
steadiness
he
would
often
unexpectedly
and
without
any
apparent
motive
abandon
one
plan
and
go
earnestly
to
work
upon
another
which
was
either
fresh
from
the
forge
of
his
imagination
or
had
at
some
former
period
been
flung
aside
half
finished
it
was
therefore
often
difficult
to
guess
what
line
of
conduct
he
might
finally
adopt
upon
any
given
occasion
although
flora
was
sincerely
attached
to
her
brother
whose
high
energies
might
indeed
have
commanded
her
admiration
even
without
the
ties
which
bound
them
together
she
was
by
no
means
blind
to
his
faults
which
she
considered
as
dangerous
to
the
hopes
of
any
woman
who
should
found
her
ideas
of
a
happy
marriage
in
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
domestic
society
and
the
exchange
of
mutual
and
engrossing
affection
the
real
disposition
of
waverley
on
the
other
hand
notwithstanding
his
dreams
of
tented
fields
and
military
honour
seemed
exclusively
domestic
he
asked
and
received
no
share
in
the
busy
scenes
which
were
constantly
going
on
around
him
and
was
rather
annoyed
than
interested
by
the
discussion
of
contending
claims
rights
and
interests
which
often
passed
in
his
presence
all
this
pointed
him
out
as
the
person
formed
to
make
happy
a
spirit
like
that
of
rose
which
corresponded
with
his
own

this
point
in
waverley
character
one
day
while
she
sat
with
miss
bradwardine
genius
and
elegant
taste
answered
rose
can
not
be
interested
in
such
trifling
discussions
what
is
it
to
him
for
example
whether
the
chief
of
the
macindallaghers
who
has
brought
out
only
fifty
men
should
be
a
colonel
or
a
captain
and
how
could
waverley
be
supposed
to
interest
himself
in
the
violent
altercation
between
your
brother
and
young
corrinaschian
whether
the
post
of
honour
is
due
to
the
eldest
cadet
of
a
clan
or
the
youngest
dear
rose
if
he
were
the
hero
you
suppose
him
he
would
interest
himself
in
these
matters
not
indeed
as
important
in
themselves
but
for
the
purpose
of
mediating
between
the
ardent
spirits
who
actually
do
make
them
the
subject
of
discord
you
saw
when
corrinaschian
raised
his
voice
in
great
passion
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
waverley
lifted
his
head
as
if
he
had
just
awaked
from
a
dream
and
asked
with
great
composure
what
the
matter
was
and
did
not
the
laughter
they
fell
into
at
his
absence
of
mind
serve
better
to
break
off
the
dispute
than
anything
he
could
have
said
to
them
my
dear
answered
flora
not
quite
so
creditably
for
waverley
as
if
he
had
brought
them
to
their
senses

force

beg
your
pardon
flora
your
brother
you
know
is
out
of
the
question
he
has
more
sense
than
half
of
them
but
can
you
think
the
fierce
hot
furious
spirits
of
whose
brawls
we
see
much
and
hear
more
and
who
terrify
me
out
of
my
life
every
day
in
the
world
are
at
all
to
be
compared
to
waverley
do
not
compare
him
with
those
uneducated
men
my
dear
rose
i
only
lament
that
with
his
talents
and
genius
he
does
not
assume
that
place
in
society
for
which
they
eminently
fit
him
and
that
he
does
not
lend
their
full
impulse
to
the
noble

not
lochiel

all

why
will
he
not
stoop
like
them
to
be
alive

i
often
believe
his
zeal
is
frozen
by
that
proud
englishman
whom
he
now
lives
with
so
much
talbot
he
is
a
very
disagreeable

be
sure
he
looks
as
if
he
thought
no
scottish

worth

trouble

i

all

more

as

in
his
place
in

quiet
circle
of
domestic
happiness
lettered
indolence

elegant
enjoyments

and
he
will
refit
the
old
library
in
the
most
exquisite
gothic
taste
and
garnish
its
shelves
with
the
rarest
and
most
valuable
volumes
and
he
will
draw
plans
and
landscapes
and
write
verses
and
rear
temples
and
dig
grottoes
and
he
will
stand
in
a
clear
summer
night
in
the
colonnade
before
the
hall
and
gaze
on
the
deer
as
they
stray
in
the
moonlight
or
lie
shadowed
by
the
boughs
of
the
huge
old
fantastic
oaks

he

repeat
verses
to

who
will
hang
upon

indeed

closer

reason
to
be
satisfied
with
it
it
contained

as

had
some

object
which
he
pursued
with
a
fury
that
waverley
considered
as
altogether
disproportioned
to
its
importance
almost
all
had
their
reasons
for
discontent
although
the
most
legitimate
was
that
of

went
to

joy
of

i
securely
anticipate
the
morrow
came
and
in
the
chief
apartment
he
found
ensign
maccombich
waiting
to
make
report
of
his
turn
of
duty
in
a
sort
of
ditch
which
they
had
dug
across
the
and
called
a
trench
in

short
time
the
chief
voice
was
heard
on
the
stair
in
a
tone
of
impatient
fury
why
callum
beg
diaoul
he
entered
the
room
with
all
the
marks
of
a
man
agitated
by
a
towering
passion
and
there
were
few
upon
whose
features
rage
produced
a
more
violent
effect
the
veins
of
his
forehead
swelled
when
he
was
in
such
agitation
his
nostril
became
dilated
his
cheek
and
eye
inflamed
and
hislook
that
of
a
demoniac
these
appearances
of
rage
were
the
more
frightful
because
they
were
obviously
caused
by
a
strong
effort
to
temper
with
discretion
an
almost
ungovernable
paroxysm
of
passion
and
resulted
from
an
internal
conflict
of
the
most
dreadful
kind
which
agitated
his
whole
frame
of
mortality
as
he
entered
the
apartment
he
unbuckled
his
broadsword
and
throwing
it
down
with
such
violence
that
the
weapon
rolled
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
know
not
what
he
exclaimed
me
from
taking
a
solemn
oath
that
i
will
never
more
draw
it
in
his
cause
load
my
pistols
callum
and
bring
them
hither
instantly
instantly
callum
whom
nothing
ever
startled
dismayed
or
disconcerted
obeyed
very
coolly
evan
dhu
upon
whose
brow
the
suspicion
that
his
chief
had
been
insulted
called
up
a
corresponding
storm
swelled
in
sullen
silence
awaiting
to
learn
where
or
upon
whom
vengeance
was
to
descend
waverley
you
are
there
said
the
chief
after
a
recollection
i
remember
i
asked
you
to
share
my
triumph
and
you
have
come
to
witness
my
disappointment
we
shall
call
it
evan
now
presented
the
written
report
he
had
in
his
hand
which
fergus
threw
from
him
with
great
passion
wish
to
god
he
said
old
den
would
tumble
down
upon
the
heads
of
the
fools
who
attack
and
the
knaves
who
defend
it
i
see
waverley
you
think
i
am
mad
leave
us

call
colonel

said
flockhart
to
evan
as
he
descended
wish
he
may
be
weel
the
very
veins
on
his

brow
are
swelled
like

wad
he
no

something
usually
lets
blood
for
these
fits
answered
the
highland
ancient
with
great
composure
when
this
officer
left
the
room
the
chieftain
gradually
reassumed
some
degree
of
composure
know
waverley
he
said
colonel
talbot
has
persuaded
you
to
curse
ten
times
a
day
your
engagement
with
us
nay
never
deny
it
for
i
am
at
this
moment
tempted
to
curse
my
own
would
you
believe
it
i
made
this
very
morning
two
suits
to
the
prince
and
he
has
rejected
them
both
what
do
you
think
of
it
can
i
think
answered
waverley
i
know
what
your
requests
were
what
signifies
what
they
were
man
i
tell
you
it
was
i
that
made
them
i
to
whom
he
owes
more
than
to
any
three
who
have
joined
the
standard
for
i
negotiated
the
whole
business
and
brought
in
all
the
perthshire
men
when
not
one
would
have
stirred
i
am
not
likely
i
think
to
ask
anything
very
unreasonable
and
if
i
did
they
might
have
stretched
a
point
well
but
you
shall
know
all
now
that
i
can
draw
my
breath
again
with
some
freedom
you
remember
my
earl
patent
it
is
dated
some
years
back
for
services
then
rendered
and
certainly
my
merit
has
not
been
diminished
to
say
the
least
by
my
subsequent
behaviour
now
sir
i
value
this
bauble
of
a
coronet
as
little
as
you
can
or
any
philosopher
on
earth
for
i
hold
that
the
chief
of
such
a
clan
as
the
sliochd
nan
ivor
is
superior
in
rank
to
any
earl
in
scotland
but
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
assuming
this
cursed
title
at
this
time
you
must
know
that
i
learned
accidentally
that
the
prince
has
been
pressing
that
old
foolish
baron
of
bradwardine
to
disinherit
his
male
heir
or
nineteenth
or
twentieth
cousin
who
has
taken
a
command
in
the
elector
of
hanover
militia
and
to
settle
his
estate
upon
your
pretty
little
friend
rose
and
this
as
being
the
command
of
his
king
and
overlord
who
may
alter
the
destination
of
a
fief
at
pleasure
the
old
gentleman
seems
well
reconciled
to
what
becomes
of
the
homage
the
homage
i
believe
rose
is
to
pull
off
the
slipper
on
her
or
some
such
trash
well
sir
as
rose
bradwardine
would
always
have
made
a
suitable
match
for
me
but
for
this
idiotical
predilection
of
her
father
for
the
male
it
occurred
to
me
there
now
remained
no
obstacle
unless
that
the
baron
might
expect
his
daughter
husband
to
take
the
name
of
bradwardine
which
you
know
would
be
impossible
in
my
case
and
that
this
might
be
evaded
by
my
assuming
the
title
to
which
i
had
so
good
a
right
and
which
of
course
would
supersede
that
difficulty
if
she
was
to
be
also
viscountess
bradwardine
in
her
own
right
after
her
father
demise
so
much
the
better
i
could
have
no
objection
fergus
said
waverley
had
no
idea
that
you
had
any
affection
for
miss
bradwardine
and
you
are
always
sneering
at
her
father
have
as
much
affection
for
miss
bradwardine
my
good
friend
as
i
think
it
necessary
to
have
for
the
future
mistress
of
my
family
and
the
mother
of
my
children
she
is
a
very
pretty
intelligent
girl
and
is
certainly
of
one
of
the
very
first
lowland
families
and
with
a
little
of
flora
instructions
and
forming
will
make
a
very
good
figure
as
to
her
father
he
is
an
original
it
is
true
and
an
absurd
one
enough
but
he
has
given
such
severe
lessons
to
sir
hew
halbert
that
dear
defunct
the
laird
of
balmawhapple
and
others
that
nobody
dare
laugh
at
him
so
his
absurdity
goes
for
nothing
i
tell
you
there
could
have
been
no
earthly
objection
none
i
had
settled
the
thing
entirely
in
my
own
mind
had
you
asked
the
baron
consent
said
waverley
rose
what
purpose
to
have
spoke
to
the
baron
before
i
had
assumed
my
title
would
have
only
provoked
a
premature
and
irritating
discussion
on
the
subject
of
the
change
of
name
when
as
earl
of
glennaquoich
i
had
only
to
propose
to
him
to
carry
his
d
d
bear
and
bootjack
party
per
pale
or
in
a
scutcheon
of
pretence
or
in
a
separate
shield
perhaps
any
way
that
would
not
blemish
my
own
coat
of
arms
and
as
to
rose
i
do
see
what
objection
she
could
have
made
if
her
father
was
satisfied
the
same
that
your
sister
makes
to
me
you
being
satisfied
fergus
gave
a
broad
stare
at
the
comparison
which
this
supposition
implied
but
cautiously
suppressed
the
answer
which
rose
to
his
tongue
we
should
easily
have
arranged
all
that
so
sir
i
craved
a
private
interview
and
this
morning
was
assigned
and
i
asked
you
to
meet
me
here
thinking
like
a
fool
that
i
should
want
your
countenance
as
well
i
state
my
pretension
they
are
not
denied
the
promises
so
repeatedly
made
and
the
patent
granted
they
are
acknowledged
but
i
propose
as
a
natural
consequence
to
assume
the
rank
which
the
patent
bestowed
i
have
the
old
story
of
the
jealousy
of
c
and
m
trumped
up
against
me
i
resist
this
pretext
and
offer
to
procure
their
written
acquiescence
in
virtue
of
the
date
of
my
patent
as
prior
to
their
silly
claims
i
assure
you
i
would
have
had
such
a
consent
from
them
if
it
had
been
at
the
point
of
the
sword
and
then
out
comes
the
real
truth
and
he
dares
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
my
patent
must
be
suppressed
for
the
present
for
fear
of
disgusting
that
rascally
coward
and
faineant
naming
the
rival
chief
of
his
own
clan
who
has
no
better
title
to
be
a
chieftain
than
i
to
be
emperor
of
china
and
who
is
pleased
to
shelter
his
dastardly
reluctance
to
come
out
agreeable
to
his
promise
twenty
times
pledged
under
a
pretended
jealousy
of
the
partiality
to
me
and
to
leave
this
miserable
driveller
without
a
pretence
for
his
cowardice
the
prince
asks
it
as
a
personal
favour
of
me
forsooth
not
to
press
my
just
and
reasonable
request
at
this
moment
after
this
put
your
faith
in
princes
did
your
audience
end
here
o
no
i
was
determined
to
leave
him
no
pretence
for
his
ingratitude
and
i
therefore
stated
with
all
the
composure
i
could
muster
for
i
promise
you
i
trembled
with
passion
the
particular
reasons
i
had
for
wishing
that
his
royal
highness
would
impose
upon
me
any
other
mode
of
exhibiting
my
duty
and
devotion
as
my
views
in
life
made
what
at
any
other
time
would
have
been
a
mere
trifle
at
this
crisis
a
severe
sacrifice
and
then
i
explained
to
him
my
full
plan
what
did
the
prince
answer
why
it
is
well
it
is
written
curse
not
the
king
no
not
in
thy
thought
why
he
answered
that
truly
he
was
glad
i
had
made
him
my
confidant
to
prevent
more
grievous
disappointment
for
he
could
assure
me
upon
the
word
of
a
prince
that
miss
bradwardine
affections
were
engaged
and
he
was
under
a
particular
promise
to
favour
them
so
my
dear
fergus
said
he
with
his
most
gracious
cast
of
smile
as
the
marriage
is
utterly
out
of
question
there
need
be
no
hurry
you
know
about
the
earldom
and
so
he
glided
off
and
left
me
plante
la
what
did
you
do
tell
you
what
i
could
have
done
at
that
moment
sold
myself
to
the
devil
or
the
elector
whichever
offered
the
dearest
revenge
however
i
am
now
cool
i
know
he
intends
to
marry
her
to
some
of
his
rascally
frenchmen
or
his
irish
officers
but
i
will
watch
them
close
and
let
the
man
that
would
supplant
me
look
well
to
himself
bisogna
coprirsi
signor
after
some
further
conversation
unnecessary
to
be
detailed
waverley
took
leave
of
the
chieftain
whose
fury
had
now
subsided
into
a
deep
and
strong
desire
of
vengeance
and
returned
home
scarce
able
to
analyse
the
mixture
of
feelings
which
the
narrative
had
awakened
in
his
own
bosom
chapter
liv
one
thing
constant
am
the
very
child
of
caprice
said
waverley
to
himself
as
he
bolted
the
door
of
his
apartment
and
paced
it
with
hasty
steps
is
it
to
me
that
fergus
should
wish
to
marry
rose
bradwardine
i
love
her
not
i
might
have
been
loved
by
her
perhaps
but
rejected
her
simple
natural
and
affecting
attachment
instead
of
cherishing
it
into
tenderness
and
dedicated
myself
to
one
who
will
never
love
mortal
man
unless
old
warwick
the
should
arise
from
the
dead
the
baron
too
i
would
not
have
cared
about
his
estate
and
so
the
name
would
have
been
no
the
devil
might
have
taken
the
barren
moors
and
drawn
off
the
royal
caligae
for
anything
i
would
have
minded
but
framed
as
she
is
for
domestic
affection
and
tenderness
for
giving
and
receiving
all
those
kind
and
quiet
attentions
which
sweeten
life
to
those
who
pass
it
together
she
is
sought
by
fergus
he
will
not
use
her
ill
to
be
sure
of
that
he
is
incapable
but
he
will
neglect
her
after
the
first
month
he
will
be
too
intent
on
subduing
some
rival
chieftain
or
circumventing
some
favourite
at
court
on
gaining
some
heathy
hill
and
lake
or
adding
to
his
bands
some
new
troop
of
caterans
to
inquire
what
she
does
or
how
she
amuses
herself
and
then
will
canker
sorrow
eat
her
bud
and
chase
the
native
beauty
from
her
cheek
and
she
will
look
as
hollow
as
a
ghost
and
dim
and
meagre
as
an
ague
fit
and
so
she
die
and
such
a
catastrophe
of
the
most
gentle
creature
on
earth
might
have
been
prevented
if
edward
waverley
had
had
his
eyes
upon
my
word
i
can
not
understand
how
i
thought
flora
so
much
that
is
so
very
much
handsomer
than
rose
she
is
taller
indeed
and
her
manner
more
formed
but
many
people
think
miss
bradwardine
more
natural
and
she
is
certainly
much
younger
i
should
think
flora
is
two
years
older
than
i
am
i
will
look
at
them
particularly
this
evening
and
with
this
resolution
waverley
went
to
drink
tea
as
the
fashion
was
sixty
years
since
at
the
house
of
a
lady
of
quality
attached
to
the
cause
of
the
chevalier
where
he
found
as
he
expected
both
the
ladies
all
rose
as
he
entered
but
flora
immediately
resumed
her
place
and
the
conversation
in
which
she
was
engaged
rose
on
the
contrary
almost
imperceptibly
made
a
little
way
in
the
crowded
circle
for
his
advancing
the
corner
of
a
chair
manner
upon
the
whole
is
most
engaging
said
waverley
to
himself
a
dispute
occurred
whether
the
gaelic
or
italian
language
was
most
liquid
and
best
adapted
for
poetry
the
opinion
for
the
gaelic
which
probably
might
not
have
found
supporters
elsewhere
was
here
fiercely
defended
by
seven
highland
ladies
who
talked
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
and
screamed
the
company
deaf
with
examples
of
celtic
euphonia
flora
observing
the
lowland
ladies
sneer
at
the
comparison
produced
some
reasons
to
show
that
it
was
not
altogether
so
absurd
but
rose
when
asked
for
her
opinion
gave
it
with
animation
in
praise
of
italian
which
she
had
studied
with
waverley
assistance
she
has
a
more
correct
ear
than
flora
though
a
less
accomplished
musician
said
waverley
to
himself
suppose
miss
will
next
compare
nan
fonn
to
ariosto
lastly
it
so
befell
that
the
company
differed
whether
fergus
should
be
asked
to
perform
on
the
flute
at
which
he
was
an
adept
or
waverley
invited
to
read
a
play
of
shakspeare
and
the
lady
of
the
house
undertook
to
collect
the
votes
of
the
company
for
poetry
or
music
under
the
condition
that
the
gentleman
whose
talents
were
not
laid
under
contribution
that
evening
should
contribute
them
to
enliven
the
next
it
chanced
that
rose
had
the
casting
vote
now
flora
who
seemed
to
impose
it
as
a
rule
upon
herself
never
to
countenance
any
proposal
which
might
seem
to
encourage
waverley
had
voted
for
music
providing
the
baron
would
take
his
violin
to
accompany
fergus
wish
you
joy
of
your
taste
miss
thought
edward
as
they
sought
for
his
book
thought
it
better
when
we
were
at
glennaquoich
but
certainly
the
baron
is
no
great
performer
and
shakspeare
is
worth
listening
to
and
juliet
was
selected
and
edward
read
with
taste
feeling
and
spirit
several
scenes
from
that
play
all
the
company
applauded
with
their
hands
and
many
with
their
tears
flora
to
whom
the
drama
was
well
known
was
among
the
former
rose
to
whom
it
was
altogether
new
belonged
to
the
latter
class
of
admirers
has
more
feeling
too
said
waverley
internally
the
conversation
turning
upon
the
incidents
of
the
play
and
upon
the
characters
fergus
declared
that
the
only
one
worth
naming
as
a
man
of
fashion
and
spirit
was
mercutio
could
not
he
said
follow
all
his
wit
but
he
must
have
been
a
very
pretty
fellow
according
to
the
ideas
of
his
time
it
was
a
shame
said
ensign
maccombich
who
usually
followed
his
colonel
everywhere
that
tibbert
or
taggart
or
whatever
was
his
name
to
stick
him
under
the
other
gentleman
arm
while
he
was
redding
the
fray
the
ladies
of
course
declared
loudly
in
favour
of
romeo
but
this
opinion
did
not
go
undisputed
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
several
other
ladies
severely
reprobated
the
levity
with
which
the
hero
transfers
his
affections
from
rosalind
to
juliet
flora
remained
silent
until
her
opinion
was
repeatedly
requested
and
then
answered
she
thought
the
circumstance
objected
to
not
only
reconcilable
to
nature
but
such
as
in
the
highest
degree
evinced
the
art
of
the
poet
is
described
said
she
a
young
man
peculiarly
susceptible
of
the
softer
passions
his
love
is
at
first
fixed
upon
a
woman
who
could
afford
it
no
return
this
he
repeatedly
tells
you
from
love
weak
childish
bow
she
lives
unharmed
and
again
she
hath
forsworn
to
love
now
as
it
was
impossible
that
romeo
love
supposing
him
a
reasonable
being
could
continue
to
subsist
without
hope
the
poet
has
with
great
art
seized
the
moment
when
he
was
reduced
actually
to
despair
to
throw
in
his
way
an
object
more
accomplished
than
her
by
whom
he
had
been
rejected
and
who
is
disposed
to
repay
his
attachment
i
can
scarce
conceive
a
situation
more
calculated
to
enhance
the
ardour
of
affection
for
juliet
than
his
being
at
once
raised

the

upon

he
exclaims

you

love
can
not

not

with

the

any

love

little

not
altogether
without
it

a
day

set
the
company
and
the
discourse
took
a
different
turn
shortly
afterwards
the
party
broke
up
and
edward
returned
home
musing
on
what
flora
had
said

love
my

he
has
given
me
a
broad
enough
hint
for
that

i
will
speak
to

resign
my
suit
but
for
a
juliet
would
it
be
handsome
to
interfere
with
pretensions
though
it
is
impossible
they
can
ever
succeed
and
should
they
miscarry
what
then
why

and
with
this
resolution

guided

did

chapter

a
brave
man
in
sorrow
ifmy
fair
readers
should
be
of
opinion
that
my
hero
levity
in
love
is
altogether
unpardonable
i
must
remind
them
that
all
his
griefs
and
difficulties
did
not
arise
from
that
sentimental
source
even
the
lyric
poet
who
complains
so
feelingly
of
the
pains
of
love
could
not
forget
that
at
the
same
time
he
was
debt
and
in
drink
which
doubtless
were
great
aggravations
of
his
distress
there
were
indeed
whole
days
in
which
waverley
thought
neither
of
flora
nor
rose
bradwardine
but
which
were
spent
in
melancholy
conjectures
on
the
probable
state
of
matters
at
and
the
dubious
issue
of
the
civil
contest
in
which
he
was
pledged
colonel
talbot
often
engaged
him
in
discussions
upon
the
justice
of
the
cause
he
had
espoused
he
said
it
is
possible
for
you
to
quit
it
at
this
present
moment
for
come
what
will
you
must
stand
by
your
rash
engagement
but
i
wish
you
to
be
aware
that
the
right
is
not
with
you
that
you
are
fighting
against
the
real
interests
of
your
country
and
that
you
ought
as
an
englishman
and
a
patriot
to
take
the
first
opportunity
to
leave
this
unhappy
expedition
before
the
snowball
melts
in
such
political
disputes
waverley
usually
opposed
the
common
arguments
of
his
party
with
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
trouble
the
reader
but
he
had
little
to
say
when
the
colonel
urged
him
to
compare
the
strength
by
which
they
had
undertaken
to
overthrow
the
government
with
that
which
was
now
assembling
very
rapidly
for
its
support
to
this
statement
waverley
had
but
one
answer
the
cause
i
have
undertaken
be
perilous
there
would
be
the
greater
disgrace
in
abandoning
it
and
in
his
turn
he
generally
silenced
colonel
talbot
and
succeeded
in
changing
the
subject
one
night
when
after
a
long
dispute
of
this
nature
the
friends
had
separated
and
our
hero
had
retired
to
bed
he
was
awakened
about
midnight
by
a
suppressed
groan
he
started
up
and
listened
it
came
from
the
apartment
of
colonel
talbot
which
was
divided
from
his
own
by
a
wainscotted
partition
with
a
door
of
communication
waverley
approached
this
door
and
distinctly
heard
one
or
two
sighs
what
could
be
the
matter
the
colonel
had
parted
from
him
apparently
in
his
usual
state
of
spirits
he
must
have
been
taken
suddenly
ill
under
this
impression
he
opened
the
door
of
communication
very
gently
and
perceived
the
colonel
in
his
seated
by
a
table
on
which
lay
a
letter
and
a
picture
he
raised
his
head
hastily
as
edward
stood
uncertain
whether
to
advance
or
retire
and
waverley
perceived
that
his
cheeks
were
stained
with
tears
as
if
ashamed
at
being
found
giving
way
to
such
emotion
colonel
talbot
rose
with
apparent
displeasure
and
said
with
some
sternness
think
waverley
my
own
apartment
and
the
hour
might
have
secured
even
a
prisoner
against
not
say
intrusion
colonel
talbot
i
heard
you
breathe
hard
and
feared
you
were
ill
that
alone
could
have
induced
me
to
break
in
upon
you
am
well
said
the
colonel
well
you
are
distressed
said
edward
there
anything
can
be
done
waverley
i
was
only
thinking
of
home
and
some
unpleasant
occurrences
there
god
my
uncle
exclaimed
waverley
it
is
a
grief
entirely
my
own
i
am
ashamed
you
should
have
seen
it
disarm
me
so
much
but
it
must
have
its
course
at
times
that
it
may
be
at
others
more
decently
supported
i
would
have
kept
it
secret
from
you
for
i
think
it
will
grieve
you
and
yet
you
can
administer
no
consolation
but
you
have
surprised
me
i
see
you
are
surprised
yourself
and
i
hate
mystery
read
that
letter
the
letter
was
from
colonel
talbot
sister
and
in
these
words
received
yours
my
dearest
brother
by
hodges
sir
and
are
still
at
large
but
are
not
permitted
to
leave
london
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
give
you
as
good
an
account
of
matters
in
the
square
but
the
news
of
the
unhappy
affair
at
preston
came
upon
us
with
the
dreadful
addition
that
you
were
among
the
fallen
you
know
lady
emily
state
of
health
when
your
friendship
for
sir
induced
you
to
leave
her
she
was
much
harassed
with
the
sad
accounts
from
scotland
of
the
rebellion
having
broken
out
but
kept
up
her
spirits
as
she
said
it
became
your
wife
and
for
the
sake
of
the
future
heir
so
long
hoped
for
in
vain
alas
my
dear
brother
these
hopes
are
now
ended
notwithstanding
all
my
watchful
care
this
unhappy
rumour
reached
her
without
preparation
she
was
taken
ill
immediately
and
the
poor
infant
scarce
survived
its
birth
would
to
god
this
were
all
but
although
the
contradiction
of
the
horrible
report
by
your
own
letter
has
greatly
revived
her
spirits
yet
apprehends
i
grieve
to
say
serious
and
even
dangerous
consequences
to
her
health
especially
from
the
uncertainty
in
which
she
must
necessarily
remain
for
some
time
aggravated
by
the
ideas
she
has
formed
of
the
ferocity
of
those
with
whom
you
are
a
prisoner
therefore
my
dear
brother
as
soon
as
this
reaches
you
endeavour
to
gain
your
release
by
parole
by
ransom
or
any
way
that
is
practicable
i
do
not
exaggerate
lady
emily
state
of
health
but
i
must
not
dare
not
suppress
the
truth
ever
my
dear
philip
your
most
affectionate
sister
talbot
edward
stood
motionless
when
he
had
perused
this
letter
for
the
conclusion
was
inevitable
that
by
the
colonel
journey
in
quest
of
him
he
had
incurred
this
heavy
calamity
it
was
severe
enough
even
in
its
irremediable
part
for
colonel
talbot
and
lady
emily
long
without
a
family
had
fondly
exulted
in
the
hopes
which
were
now
blasted
but
this
disappointment
was
nothing
to
the
extent
of
the
threatened
evil
and
edward
with
horror
regarded
himself
as
the
original
cause
of
both
ere
he
could
collect
himself
sufficiently
to
speak
colonel
talbot
had
recovered
his
usual
composure
of
manner
though
his
troubled
eye
denoted
his
mental
agony
is
a
woman
my
young
friend
who
may
justify
even
a
tears
he
reached
him
the
miniature
exhibiting
features
which
fully
justified
the
eulogium
yet
god
knows
what
you
see
of
her
there
is
the
least
of
the
charms
she
possesses
possessed
i
should
perhaps
say
but
god
will
be
done
you
must
fly
you
must
fly
instantly
to
her
relief
it
is
not
it
shall
not
be
too
late
how
is
it
possible
i
am
a
prisoner
upon
parole
am
your
keeper
i
restore
your
parole
i
am
to
answer
for
you
can
not
do
so
consistently
with
your
duty
nor
can
i
accept
a
discharge
from
you
with
due
regard
to
my
own
honour
you
would
be
made
responsible
will
answer
it
with
my
head
if
necessary
said
waverley
impetuously
have
been
the
unhappy
cause
of
the
loss
of
your
child
make
me
not
the
murderer
of
your
wife
my
dear
edward
said
talbot
taking
him
kindly
by
the
hand
are
in
no
respect
to
blame
and
if
i
concealed
this
domestic
distress
for
two
days
it
was
lest
your
sensibility
should
view
it
in
that
light
you
could
not
think
of
me
hardly
knew
of
my
existence
when
i
left
england
in
quest
of
you
it
is
a
responsibility
heaven
knows
sufficiently
heavy
for
mortality
that
we
must
answer
for
the
foreseen
and
direct
result
of
our
actions
for
their
indirect
and
consequential
operation
the
great
and
good
being
who
alone
can
foresee
the
dependence
of
human
events
on
each
other
hath
not
pronounced
his
frail
creatures
liable
that
you
should
have
left
lady
emily
said
waverley
with
much
emotion
the
situation
of
all
others
the
most
interesting
to
a
husband
to
seek
a
only
did
my
duty
answered
colonel
talbot
calmly
i
do
not
ought
not
to
regret
it
if
the
path
of
gratitude
and
honour
were
always
smooth
and
easy
there
would
be
little
merit
in
following
it
but
it
moves
often
in
contradiction
to
our
interest
and
passions
and
sometimes
to
our
better
affections
these
are
the
trials
of
life
and
this
though
not
the
least
bitter
the
tears
came
unbidden
to
his
eyes
not
the
first
which
it
has
been
my
fate
to
encounter
but
we
will
talk
of
this
he
said
wringing
waverley
hands
strive
to
forget
it
for
a
few
hours
it
will
dawn
i
think
by
six
and
it
is
now
past
two
edward
retired
without
trusting
his
voice
with
a
reply
chapter
lvi
exertion
when
colonel
talbot
entered
the
next
morning
he
learned
from
waverley
servant
that
our
hero
had
been
abroad
at
an
early
hour
and
was
not
yet
returned
the
morning
was
well
advanced
before
he
again
appeared
he
arrived
out
of
breath
but
with
an
air
of
joy
that
astonished
colonel
talbot
said
he
throwing
a
paper
on
the
table
is
my
morning
work
alick
pack
up
the
colonel
clothes
make
haste
make
haste
the
colonel
examined
the
paper
with
astonishment
it
was
a
pass
from
the
chevalier
to
colonel
talbot
to
repair
to
leith
or
any
other
port
in
possession
of
his
royal
highness
troops
and
there
to
embark
for
england
or
elsewhere
at
his
free
pleasure
he
only
giving
his
parole
of
honour
not
to
bear
arms
against
the
house
of
stuart
for
the
space
of
a
the
name
of
god
said
the
colonel
his
eyes
sparkling
with
eagerness
did
you
obtain
this
was
at
the
chevalier
levee
as
soon
as
he
usually
rises
he
was
gone
to
the
camp
at
duddingston
i
pursued
him
thither
asked
and
obtained
an
audience
but
i
will
tell
you
not
a
word
more
unless
i
see
you
begin
to
pack
i
know
whether
i
can
avail
myself
of
this
passport
or
how
it
was
obtained
you
can
take
out
the
things
again
you
know
now
i
see
you
busy
i
will
go
on
when
i
first
mentioned
your
name
his
eyes
sparkled
almost
as
bright
as
yours
did
two
minutes
since
had
you
he
earnestly
asked
shown
any
sentiments
favourable
to
his
cause
not
in
the
least
nor
was
there
any
hope
you
would
do
so
his
countenance
fell
i
requested
your
freedom
impossible
he
said
your
importance
as
a
friend
and
confidant
of
such
and
such
personages
made
my
request
altogether
extravagant
i
told
him
my
own
story
and
yours
and
asked
him
to
judge
what
my
feelings
must
be
by
his
own
he
has
a
heart
and
a
kind
one
colonel
talbot
you
may
say
what
you
please
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
the
pass
with
his
own
hand
i
will
not
trust
myself
with
my
council
he
said
they
will
argue
me
out
of
what
is
right
i
will
not
endure
that
a
friend
valued
as
i
value
you
should
be
loaded
with
the
painful
reflections
which
must
afflict
you
in
case
of
further
misfortune
in
colonel
talbot
family
nor
will
i
keep
a
brave
enemy
a
prisoner
under
such
circumstances
besides
said
he
i
think
i
can
justify
myself
to
my
prudent
advisers
by
pleading
the
good
effect
such
lenity
will
produce
on
the
minds
of
the
great
english
families
with
whom
colonel
talbot
is
connected
the
politician
peeped
out
said
the
colonel
at
least
he
concluded
like
a
king
son
take
the
passport
i
have
added
a
condition
for
form
sake
but
if
the
colonel
objects
to
it
let
him
depart
without
giving
any
parole
whatever
i
come
here
to
war
with
men
but
not
to
distress
or
endanger
women
i
never
thought
to
have
been
so
much
indebted
to
the
pretend
the
prince
said
waverley
smiling
the
chevalier
said
the
colonel
is
a
good
travelling
name
and
which
we
may
both
freely
use
did
he
say
anything
more
asked
if
there
was
anything
else
he
could
oblige
me
in
and
when
i
replied
in
the
negative
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
wished
all
his
followers
were
as
considerate
since
some
friends
of
mine
not
only
asked
all
he
had
to
bestow
but
many
things
which
were
entirely
out
of
his
power
or
that
of
the
greatest
sovereign
upon
earth
indeed
he
said
no
prince
seemed
in
the
eyes
of
his
followers
so
like
the
deity
as
himself
if
you
were
to
judge
from
the
extravagant
requests
which
they
daily
preferred
to
him
young
gentleman
said
the
colonel
suppose
he
begins
to
feel
the
difficulties
of
his
situation
well
dear
waverley
this
is
more
than
kind
and
shall
not
be
forgotten
while
philip
talbot
can
remember
anything
my
life
pshaw
let
emily
thank
you
for
that
this
is
a
favour
worth
fifty
lives
i
can
not
hesitate
on
giving
my
parole
in
the
circumstances
there
it
is
he
wrote
it
out
in
form
and
now
how
am
i
to
get
off
that
is
settled
your
baggage
is
packed
my
horses
wait
and
a
boat
has
been
engaged
by
the
prince
permission
to
put
you
on
board
the
fox
frigate
i
sent
a
messenger
down
to
leith
on
purpose
will
do
excellently
well
captain
beaver
is
my
particular
friend
he
will
put
me
ashore
at
berwick
or
shields
from
whence
i
can
ride
post
to
london
and
you
must
entrust
me
with
the
packet
of
papers
which
you
recovered
by
means
of
your
miss
bean
lean
i
may
have
an
opportunity
of
using
them
to
your
advantage
but
i
see
your
highland
friend
glen
what
do
you
call
his
barbarous
name
and
his
orderly
with
him
i
must
not
call
him
his
orderly
throat
any
more
i
suppose
see
how
he
walks
as
if
the
world
were
his
own
with
the
bonnet
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
his
plaid
puffed
out
across
his
breast
i
should
like
now
to
meet
that
youth
where
my
hands
were
not
tied
i
would
tame
his
pride
or
he
should
tame
mine
shame
colonel
talbot
you
swell
at
sight
of
tartan
as
the
bull
is
said
to
do
at
scarlet
you
and
have
some
points
not
much
unlike
so
far
as
national
prejudice
is
concerned
the
latter
part
of
this
discourse
took
place
in
the
street
they
passed
the
chief
the
colonel
and
he
sternly
and
punctiliously
greeting
each
other
like
two
duellists
before
they
take
their
ground
it
was
evident
the
dislike
was
mutual
never
see
that
surly
fellow
that
dogs
his
heels
said
the
colonel
after
he
had
mounted
his
horse
he
reminds
me
of
lines
i
have
somewhere
heard
upon
the
stage
i
think
close
behind
him
stalks
sullen
bertram
like
a
sorcerer
fiend
pressing
to
be
employed
assure
you
colonel
said
waverley
you
judge
too
harshly
of
the
highlanders
a
whit
not
a
whit
i
can
not
spare
them
a
jot
i
can
not
bate
them
an
ace
let
them
stay
in
their
own
barren
mountains
and
puff
and
swell
and
hang
their
bonnets
on
the
horns
of
the
moon
if
they
have
a
mind
but
what
business
have
they
to
come
where
people
wear
breeches
and
speak
an
intelligible
language
i
mean
intelligible
in
comparison
to
their
gibberish
for
even
the
lowlanders
talk
a
kind
of
english
little
better
than
the
negroes
in
jamaica
i
could
pity
the
pr
i
mean
the
chevalier
himself
for
having
so
many
desperadoes
about
him
and
they
learn
their
trade
so
early
there
is
a
kind
of
subaltern
imp
for
example
a
sort
of
sucking
devil
whom
your
friend
glena
glenamuck
there
has
sometimes
in
his
train
to
look
at
him
he
is
about
fifteen
years
but
he
is
a
century
old
in
mischief
and
villainy
he
was
playing
at
quoits
the
other
day
in
the
court
a
gentleman
a
person
enough
came
past
and
as
a
quoit
hit
his
shin
he
lifted
his
cane
but
my
young
bravo
whips
out
his
pistol
like
beau
clincher
in
the
trip
to
the
jubilee
and
had
not
a
scream
of
gardez
from
an
upper
window
set
all
parties
for
fear
of
the
inevitable
consequences
the
poor
gentleman
would
have
lost
his
life
by
the
hands
of
that
little
cockatrice
fine
character
you
give
of
scotland
upon
your
return
colonel
talbot
justice
shallow
said
the
colonel
save
me
the
trouble
barren
barren
beggars
all
beggars
all
marry
good
air
and
that
only
when
you
are
fairly
out
of
edinburgh
and
not
yet
come
to
leith
as
is
our
case
at
present
in
a
short
time
they
arrived
at
the
seaport
the
boat
rock
at
the
pier
of
leith
full
loud
the
wind
blew
down
the
ferry
the
ship
rode
at
the
berwick
law
colonel
may
you
find
all
as
you
would
wish
it
perhaps
we
may
meet
sooner
than
you
expect
they
talk
of
an
immediate
route
to
england
me
nothing
of
that
said
talbot
wish
to
carry
no
news
of
your
motions
then
adieu
say
with
a
thousand
kind
greetings
all
that
is
dutiful
and
affectionate
to
sir
everard
and
aunt
rachel
think
of
me
as
kindly
as
you
can
speak
of
me
as
indulgently
as
your
conscience
will
permit
and
once
more
adieu
adieu
my
dear
waverley
many
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
unplaid
yourself
on
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
ever
think
on
you
with
gratitude
and
the
worst
of
my
censure
shall
be
que
diable
faire
dans
cette
galere
and
thus
they
parted
colonel
talbot
going
on
board
of
the
boat
and
waverley
returning
to
edinburgh
chapter
lvii
the
march
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
intrude
upon
the
province
of
history
we
shall
therefore
only
remind
our
readers
that
about
the
beginning
of
november
the
young
chevalier
at
the
head
of
about
six
thousand
men
at
the
utmost
resolved
to
peril
his
cause
on
an
attempt
to
penetrate
into
the
centre
of
england
although
aware
of
the
mighty
preparations
which
were
made
for
his
reception
they
set
forward
on
this
crusade
in
weather
which
would
have
rendered
any
other
troops
incapable
of
marching
but
which
in
reality
gave
these
active
mountaineers
advantages
over
a
less
hardy
enemy
in
defiance
of
a
superior
army
lying
upon
the
borders
under
marshal
wade
they
besieged
and
took
carlisle
and
soon
afterwards
prosecuted
their
daring
march
to
the
southward
as
colonel
regiment
marched
in
the
van
of
the
clans
he
and
waverley
who
now
equalled
any
highlander
in
the
endurance
of
fatigue
and
was
become
somewhat
acquainted
with
their
language
were
perpetually
at
its
head
they
marked
the
progress
of
the
army
however
with
very
different
eyes
fergus
all
air
and
fire
and
confident
against
the
world
in
arms
measured
nothing
but
that
every
step
was
a
yard
nearer
london
he
neither
asked
expected
nor
desired
any
aid
except
that
of
the
clans
to
place
the
stuarts
once
more
on
the
throne
and
when
by
chance
a
few
adherents
joined
the
standard
he
always
considered
them
in
the
light
of
new
claimants
upon
the
favours
of
the
future
monarch
who
he
concluded
must
therefore
subtract
for
their
gratification
so
much
of
the
bounty
which
ought
to
be
shared
among
his
highland
followers
edward
views
were
very
different
he
could
not
but
observe
that
in
those
towns
in
which
they
proclaimed
james
the
third
man
cried
god
bless
him
the
mob
stared
and
listened
heartless
stupefied
and
dull
but
gave
few
signs
even
of
that
boisterous
spirit
which
induces
them
to
shout
upon
all
occasions
for
the
mere
exercise
of
their
most
sweet
voices
the
jacobites
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
the
counties
abounded
with
wealthy
squires
and
hardy
yeomen
devoted
to
the
cause
of
the
white
rose
but
of
the
wealthier
tories
they
saw
little
some
fled
from
their
houses
some
feigned
themselves
sick
some
surrendered
themselves
to
the
government
as
suspected
persons
of
such
as
remained
the
ignorant
gazed
with
astonishment
mixed
with
horror
and
aversion
at
the
wild
appearance
unknown
language
and
singular
garb
of
the
scottish
clans
and
to
the
more
prudent
their
scanty
numbers
apparent
deficiency
in
discipline
and
poverty
of
equipment
seemed
certain
tokens
of
the
calamitous
termination
of
their
rash
undertaking
thus
the
few
who
joined
them
were
such
as
bigotry
of
political
principle
blinded
to
consequences
or
whose
broken
fortunes
induced
them
to
hazard
all
on
a
risk
so
desperate
the
baron
of
bradwardine
being
asked
what
he
thought
of
these
recruits
took
a
long
pinch
of
snuff
and
answered
drily
he
could
not
but
have
an
excellent
opinion
of
them
since
they
resembled
precisely
the
followers
who
attached
themselves
to
the
good
king
david
at
the
cave
of
adullam
videlicet
every
one
that
was
in
distress
and
every
one
that
was
in
debt
and
every
one
that
was
discontented
which
the
vulgate
renders
bitter
of
soul
and
doubtless
he
said
will
prove
mighty
men
of
their
hands
and
there
is
much
need
that
they
should
for
i
have
seen
many
a
sour
look
cast
upon
us
but
none
of
these
considerations
moved
fergus
he
admired
the
luxuriant
beauty
of
the
country
and
the
situation
of
many
of
the
seats
which
they
passed
like
that
house
edward
is
larger
your
uncle
park
as
fine
a
one
as
that
is
three
times
as
extensive
and
rather
resembles
a
forest
than
a
mere
park
will
be
a
happy
woman
hope
miss
will
have
much
reason
for
happiness
unconnected
with
hope
so
too
but
to
be
mistress
of
such
a
place
will
be
a
pretty
addition
to
the
sum
total
addition
the
want
of
which
i
trust
will
be
amply
supplied
by
some
other
means
said
fergus
stopping
short
and
turning
upon
waverley
am
i
to
understand
that
waverley
had
i
the
pleasure
to
hear
you
aright
right
fergus
am
i
to
understand
that
you
no
longer
desire
my
alliance
and
my
sister
hand
sister
has
refused
mine
said
waverley
directly
and
by
all
the
usual
means
by
which
ladies
repress
undesired
attentions
have
no
idea
answered
the
chieftain
a
lady
dismissing
or
a
gentleman
withdrawing
his
suit
after
it
has
been
approved
of
by
her
legal
guardian
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
talking
the
matter
over
with
the
lady
you
did
not
i
suppose
expect
my
sister
to
drop
into
your
mouth
like
a
ripe
plum
the
first
moment
you
chose
to
open
it
to
the
lady
title
to
dismiss
her
lover
colonel
replied
edward
is
a
point
which
you
must
argue
with
her
as
i
am
ignorant
of
the
customs
of
the
highlands
in
that
particular
but
as
to
my
title
to
acquiesce
in
a
rejection
from
her
without
an
appeal
to
your
interest
i
will
tell
you
plainly
without
meaning
to
undervalue
miss
admitted
beauty
and
accomplishments
that
i
would
not
take
the
hand
of
an
angel
with
an
empire
for
her
dowry
if
her
consent
were
extorted
by
the
importunity
of
friends
and
guardians
and
did
not
flow
from
her
own
free
inclination
angel
with
the
dowry
of
an
empire
repeated
fergus
in
a
tone
of
bitter
irony
not
very
likely
to
be
pressed
upon
a
shire
squire
but
sir
changing
his
tone
flora
have
not
the
dowry
of
an
empire
she
is
my
sister
and
that
is
sufficient
at
least
to
secure
her
against
being
treated
with
anything
approaching
to
levity
is
flora
sir
said
waverley
with
firmness
to
me
were
i
capable
of
treating
any
woman
with
levity
would
be
a
more
effectual
protection
the
brow
of
the
chieftain
was
now
fully
clouded
but
edward
felt
too
indignant
at
the
unreasonable
tone
which
he
had
adopted
to
avert
the
storm
by
the
least
concession
they
both
stood
still
while
this
short
dialogue
passed
and
fergus
seemed
half
disposed
to
say
something
more
violent
but
by
a
strong
effort
suppressed
his
passion
and
turning
his
face
forward
walked
sullenly
on
as
they
had
always
hitherto
walked
together
and
almost
constantly
side
by
side
waverley
pursued
his
course
silently
in
the
same
direction
determined
to
let
the
chief
take
his
own
time
in
recovering
the
which
he
had
so
unreasonably
discarded
and
firm
in
his
resolution
not
to
bate
him
an
inch
of
dignity
after
they
had
marched
on
in
this
sullen
manner
about
a
mile
fergus
resumed
the
discourse
in
a
different
tone
believe
i
was
warm
my
dear
edward
but
you
provoke
me
with
your
want
of
knowledge
of
the
world
you
have
taken
pet
at
some
of
prudery
or
notions
of
loyalty
and
now
like
a
child
you
quarrel
with
the
plaything
you
have
been
crying
for
and
beat
me
your
faithful
keeper
because
my
arm
can
not
reach
to
edinburgh
to
hand
it
to
you
i
am
sure
if
i
was
passionate
the
mortification
of
losing
the
alliance
of
such
a
friend
after
your
arrangement
had
been
the
talk
of
both
highlands
and
lowlands
and
that
without
so
much
as
knowing
why
or
wherefore
might
well
provoke
calmer
blood
than
mine
i
shall
write
to
edinburgh
and
put
all
to
rights
that
is
if
you
desire
i
should
do
so
as
indeed
i
can
not
suppose
that
your
good
opinion
of
flora
it
being
such
as
you
have
often
expressed
to
me
can
be
at
once
laid
aside
said
edward
who
had
no
mind
to
be
hurried
farther
or
faster
than
he
chose
in
a
matter
which
he
had
already
considered
as
broken
off
am
fully
sensible
of
the
value
of
your
good
offices
and
certainly
by
your
zeal
on
my
behalf
in
such
an
affair
you
do
me
no
small
honour
but
as
miss
has
made
her
election
freely
and
voluntarily
and
as
all
my
attentions
in
edinburgh
were
received
with
more
than
coldness
i
can
not
in
justice
either
to
her
or
myself
consent
that
she
should
again
be
harassed
upon
this
topic
i
would
have
mentioned
this
to
you
some
time
since
but
you
saw
the
footing
upon
which
we
stood
together
and
must
have
understood
it
had
i
thought
otherwise
i
would
have
earlier
spoken
but
i
had
a
natural
reluctance
to
enter
upon
a
subject
so
painful
to
us
both
very
well
waverley
said
fergus
haughtily
thing
is
at
an
end
i
have
no
occasion
to
press
my
sister
upon
any
man
have
i
any
occasion
to
court
repeated
rejection
from
the
same
young
lady
answered
edward
in
the
same
tone
shall
make
due
inquiry
however
said
the
chieftain
without
noticing
the
interruption
learn
what
my
sister
thinks
of
all
this
we
will
then
see
whether
it
is
to
end
here
such
inquiries
you
will
of
course
be
guided
by
your
own
judgment
said
waverley
is
i
am
aware
impossible
miss
can
change
her
mind
and
were
such
an
unsupposable
case
to
happen
it
is
certain
i
will
not
change
mine
i
only
mention
this
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
future
misconstruction
gladly
at
this
moment
would
have
put
their
quarrel
to
a
personal
arbitrement
his
eye
flashed
fire
and
he
measured
edward
as
if
to
choose
where
he
might
best
plant
a
mortal
wound
but
although
we
do
not
now
quarrel
according
to
the
modes
and
figures
of
caranza
or
vincent
saviola
no
one
knew
better
than
fergus
that
there
must
be
some
decent
pretext
for
a
mortal
duel
for
instance
you
may
challenge
a
man
for
treading
on
your
corn
in
a
crowd
or
for
pushing
you
up
to
the
wall
or
for
taking
your
seat
in
the
theatre
but
the
modern
code
of
honour
will
not
permit
you
to
found
a
quarrel
upon
your
right
of
compelling
a
man
to
continue
addresses
to
a
female
relative
which
the
fair
lady
has
already
refused
so
that
fergus
was
compelled
to
stomach
this
supposed
affront
until
the
whirligig
of
time
whose
motion
he
promised
himself
he
would
watch
most
sedulously
should
bring
about
an
opportunity
of
revenge
waverley
servant
always
led
a
for
him
in
the
rear
of
the
battalion
to
which
he
was
attached
though
his
master
seldom
rode
but
now
incensed
at
the
domineering
and
unreasonable
conduct
of
his
late
friend
he
fell
behind
the
column
and
mounted
his
horse
resolving
to
seek
the
baron
of
bradwardine
and
request
permission
to
volunteer
in
his
troop
instead
of
the
regiment
happy
time
of
it
i
should
have
had
thought
he
after
he
was
mounted
have
been
so
closely
allied
to
this
superb
specimen
of
pride
and
and
passion
a
colonel
why
he
should
have
been
a
generalissimo
a
petty
chief
of
three
or
four
hundred
men
his
pride
might
suffice
for
the
cham
of
tartary
the
grand
seignior
the
great
mogul
i
am
well
free
of
him
were
flora
an
angel
she
would
bring
with
her
a
second
lucifer
of
ambition
and
wrath
for
a
the
baron
whose
learning
like
sancho
jests
while
in
the
sierra
morena
seemed
to
grow
mouldy
for
want
of
exercise
joyfully
embraced
the
opportunity
of
waverley
offering
his
service
in
his
regiment
to
bring
it
into
some
exertion
the
old
gentleman
however
laboured
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
the
two
quondam
friends
fergus
turned
a
cold
ear
to
his
remonstrances
though
he
gave
them
a
respectful
hearing
and
as
for
waverley
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
be
the
first
in
courting
a
renewal
of
the
intimacy
which
the
chieftain
had
so
unreasonably
disturbed
the
baron
then
mentioned
the
matter
to
the
prince
who
anxious
to
prevent
quarrels
in
his
little
army
declared
he
would
himself
remonstrate
with
colonel
on
the
unreasonableness
of
his
conduct
but
in
the
hurry
of
their
march
it
was
a
day
or
two
before
he
had
an
opportunity
to
exert
his
influence
in
the
manner
proposed
in
the
meanwhile
waverley
turned
the
instructions
he
had
received
while
in
gardiner
dragoons
to
some
account
and
assisted
the
baron
in
his
command
as
a
sort
of
adjutant
les
aveugles
un
borgne
est
roi
says
the
french
proverb
and
the
cavalry
which
consisted
chiefly
of
lowland
gentlemen
their
tenants
and
servants
formed
a
high
opinion
of
waverley
skill
and
a
great
attachment
to
his
person
this
was
indeed
partly
owing
to
the
satisfaction
which
they
felt
at
the
distinguished
english
volunteer
leaving
the
highlanders
to
rank
among
them
for
there
was
a
latent
grudge
between
the
horse
and
foot
not
only
owing
to
the
difference
of
the
services
but
because
most
of
the
gentlemen
living
near
the
highlands
had
at
one
time
or
other
had
quarrels
with
the
tribes
in
their
vicinity
and
all
of
them
looked
with
a
jealous
eye
on
the
highlanders
avowed
pretensions
to
superior
valour
and
utility
in
the
prince
service
chapter
lviii
the
confusion
of
king
agramant
camp
itwas
waverley
custom
sometimes
to
ride
a
little
apart
from
the
main
body
to
look
at
any
object
of
curiosity
which
occurred
on
the
march
they
were
now
in
lancashire
when
attracted
by
a
castellated
old
hall
he
left
the
squadron
for
half
an
hour
to
take
a
survey
and
slight
sketch
of
it
as
he
returned
down
the
avenue
he
was
met
by
ensign
maccombich
this
man
had
contracted
a
sort
of
regard
for
edward
since
the
day
of
his
first
seeing
him
at
and
introducing
him
to
the
highlands
he
seemed
to
loiter
as
if
on
purpose
to
meet
with
our
hero
yet
as
he
passed
him
he
only
approached
his
stirrup
and
pronounced
the
single
word
and
then
walked
swiftly
on
shunning
all
further
communication
edward
somewhat
surprised
at
this
hint
followed
with
his
eyes
the
course
of
evan
who
speedily
disappeared
among
the
trees
his
servant
alick
polwarth
who
was
in
attendance
also
looked
after
the
highlander
and
then
riding
up
close
to
his
master
said
be
in
me
sir
if
i
think
you
safe
amang
thae
highland
rinthereouts
do
you
mean
alick
said
waverley
sir
hae
gotten
it
into
their
heads
that
ye
hae
affronted
their
young
leddy
miss
flora
and
i
hae
heard
mae
than
ane
say
they
wadna
tak
muckle
to
mak
a
o
ye
and
ye
ken
weel
eneugh
there
mony
o
them
wadna
mind
a
bawbee
the
weising
a
ball
through
the
prince
himsell
an
the
chief
gae
them
the
wink
or
whether
he
did
or
no
if
they
thought
it
a
thing
that
would
please
him
when
it
was
dune
waverley
though
confident
that
fergus
was
incapable
of
such
treachery
was
by
no
means
equally
sure
of
the
forbearance
of
his
followers
he
knew
that
where
the
honour
of
the
chief
or
his
family
was
supposed
to
be
touched
the
happiest
man
would
be
he
that
could
first
avenge
the
stigma
and
he
had
often
heard
them
quote
a
proverb
the
best
revenge
was
the
most
speedy
and
most
safe
coupling
this
with
the
hint
of
evan
he
judged
it
most
prudent
to
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
ride
briskly
back
to
the
squadron
ere
he
reached
the
end
of
the
long
avenue
however
a
ball
whistled
past
him
and
the
report
of
a
pistol
was
heard
was
that
deevil
buckle
callum
beg
said
alick
saw
him
whisk
away
through
amang
the
reises
edward
justly
incensed
at
this
act
of
treachery
galloped
out
of
the
avenue
and
observed
the
battalion
of
at
some
distance
moving
along
the
common
in
which
it
terminated
he
also
saw
an
individual
running
very
fast
to
join
the
party
this
he
concluded
was
the
intended
assassin
who
by
leaping
an
enclosure
might
easily
make
a
much
shorter
path
to
the
main
body
than
he
could
find
on
horseback
unable
to
contain
himself
he
commanded
alick
to
go
to
the
baron
of
bradwardine
who
was
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
about
half
a
mile
in
front
and
acquaint
him
with
what
had
happened
he
himself
immediately
rode
up
to
regiment
the
chief
himself
was
in
the
act
of
joining
them
he
was
on
horseback
having
returned
from
waiting
on
the
prince
on
perceiving
edward
approaching
he
put
his
horse
in
motion
towards
him
said
waverley
without
any
farther
salutation
have
to
inform
you
that
one
of
your
people
has
this
instant
fired
at
me
from
a
that
answered
the
circumstance
of
a
is
a
pleasure
which
i
presently
propose
to
myself
i
should
be
glad
to
know
which
of
my
clansmen
dared
to
anticipate
me
shall
certainly
be
at
your
command
whenever
you
please
the
gentleman
who
took
your
office
upon
himself
is
your
page
there
callum
beg
forth
from
the
ranks
callum
did
you
fire
at
mr
waverley
answered
the
unblushing
callum
did
said
alick
polwarth
who
was
already
returned
having
met
a
trooper
by
whom
he
despatched
an
account
of
what
was
going
forward
to
the
baron
of
bradwardine
while
he
himself
returned
to
his
master
at
full
gallop
neither
sparing
the
rowels
of
his
spurs
nor
the
sides
of
his
horse
did
i
saw
you
as
plainly
as
i
ever
saw
the
auld
kirk
at
coudingham
lie
replied
callum
with
his
usual
impenetrable
obstinacy
the
combat
between
the
knights
would
certainly
as
in
the
days
of
chivalry
have
been
preceded
by
an
encounter
between
the
squires
for
alick
was
a
merseman
and
feared
the
bow
of
cupid
far
more
than
a
highlander
dirk
or
claymore
but
fergus
with
his
usual
tone
of
decision
demanded
callum
pistol
the
cock
was
down
the
pan
and
muzzle
were
black
with
the
smoke
it
had
been
that
instant
fired
that
said
fergus
striking
the
boy
upon
the
head
with
the
heavy
with
his
whole
force
that
for
acting
without
orders
and
lying
to
disguise
it
callum
received
the
blow
without
appearing
to
flinch
from
it
and
fell
without
sign
of
life
still
upon
your
lives
said
fergus
to
the
rest
of
the
clan
blow
out
the
brains
of
the
first
man
who
interferes
between
waverley
and
me
they
stood
motionless
evan
dhu
alone
showed
symptoms
of
vexation
and
anxiety
callum
lay
on
the
ground
bleeding
copiously
but
no
one
ventured
to
give
him
any
assistance
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
gotten
his
now
for
you
waverley
please
to
turn
your
horse
twenty
yards
with
me
upon
the
common
waverley
complied
and
fergus
confronting
him
when
they
were
a
little
way
from
the
line
of
march
said
with
great
affected
coolness
could
not
but
wonder
sir
at
the
fickleness
of
taste
which
you
were
pleased
to
express
the
other
day
but
it
was
not
an
angel
as
you
justly
observed
who
had
charms
for
you
unless
she
brought
an
empire
for
her
fortune
i
have
now
an
excellent
commentary
upon
that
obscure
text
am
at
a
loss
even
to
guess
at
your
meaning
colonel
unless
it
seems
plain
that
you
intend
to
fasten
a
quarrel
upon
me
affected
ignorance
shall
not
serve
you
sir
the
prince
the
prince
himself
has
acquainted
me
with
your
manoeuvres
i
little
thought
that
your
engagements
with
miss
bradwardine
were
the
reason
of
your
breaking
off
your
intended
match
with
my
sister
i
suppose
the
information
that
the
baron
had
altered
the
destination
of
his
estate
was
quite
a
sufficient
reason
for
slighting
your
friend
sister
and
carrying
off
your
friend
mistress
the
prince
tell
you
i
was
engaged
to
miss
bradwardine
said
waverley
did
sir
answered
either
draw
and
defend
yourself
or
resign
your
pretensions
to
the
lady
is
absolute
madness
exclaimed
waverley
some
strange
mistake
no
evasion
draw
your
sword
said
the
infuriated
chieftain
his
own
already
unsheathed
i
fight
in
a
madman
quarrel
give
up
now
and
forever
all
pretensions
to
miss
bradwardine
hand
title
have
you
cried
waverley
utterly
losing
command
of
himself
title
have
you
or
any
man
living
to
dictate
such
terms
to
me
and
he
also
drew
his
sword
at
this
moment
the
baron
of
bradwardine
followed
by
several
of
his
troop
came
up
on
the
spur
some
from
curiosity
others
to
take
part
in
the
quarrel
which
they
indistinctly
understood
had
broken
out
between
the
and
their
corps
the
clan
seeing
them
approach
put
themselves
in
motion
to
support
their
chieftain
and
a
scene
of
confusion
commenced
which
seamed
likely
to
terminate
in
bloodshed
a
hundred
tongues
were
in
motion
at
once
the
baron
lectured
the
chieftain
stormed
the
highlanders
screamed
in
gaelic
the
horsemen
cursed
and
swore
in
lowland
scotch
at
length
matters
came
to
such
a
pass
that
the
baron
threatened
to
charge
the
unless
they
resumed
their
ranks
and
many
of
them
in
return
presented
their
firearms
at
him
and
the
other
troopers
the
confusion
was
privately
fostered
by
old
ballenkeiroch
who
made
no
doubt
that
his
own
day
of
vengeance
was
arrived
when
behold
a
cry
arose
of
make
way
place
a
monseigneur
place
a
monseigneur
this
announced
the
approach
of
the
prince
who
came
up
with
a
party
of
foreign
dragoons
that
acted
as
his
his
arrival
produced
some
degree
of
order
the
highlanders
reassumed
their
ranks
the
cavalry
fell
in
and
formed
squadron
and
the
baron
and
chieftain
were
silent
the
prince
called
them
and
waverley
before
him
having
heard
the
original
cause
of
the
quarrel
through
the
villainy
of
callum
beg
he
ordered
him
into
custody
of
the
for
immediate
execution
in
the
event
of
his
surviving
the
chastisement
inflicted
by
his
chieftain
fergus
however
in
a
tone
betwixt
claiming
a
right
and
asking
a
favour
requested
he
might
be
left
to
his
disposal
and
promised
his
punishment
should
be
exemplary
to
deny
this
might
have
seemed
to
encroach
on
the
patriarchal
authority
of
the
chieftains
of
which
they
were
very
jealous
and
they
were
not
persons
to
be
disobliged
callum
was
therefore
left
to
the
justice
of
his
own
tribe
the
prince
next
demanded
to
know
the
new
cause
of
quarrel
between
colonel
and
waverley
there
was
a
pause
both
gentlemen
found
the
presence
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
for
by
this
time
all
three
had
approached
the
chevalier
by
his
command
an
insurmountable
barrier
against
entering
upon
a
subject
where
the
name
of
his
daughter
must
unavoidably
be
mentioned
they
turned
their
eyes
on
the
ground
with
looks
in
which
shame
and
embarrassment
were
mingled
with
displeasure
the
prince
who
had
been
educated
amongst
the
discontented
and
mutinous
spirits
of
the
court
of
germains
where
feuds
of
every
kind
were
the
daily
subject
of
solicitude
to
the
dethroned
sovereign
had
served
his
apprenticeship
as
old
frederick
of
prussia
would
have
said
to
the
trade
of
royalty
to
promote
or
restore
concord
among
his
followers
was
indispensable
accordingly
he
took
his
measures
de
beaujeu
said
a
very
handsome
french
cavalry
officer
who
was
in
attendance
la

replied
mons
le
comte
de
beaujeu
his
head
bending
down
to
the
neck
of
his
little
prancing
managed
charger
accordingly
he
piaffed
away
in
high
spirits
and
confidence
to
the
head
of
fergus
regiment
although
understanding
not
a
word
of
gaelic
and
very
little
english

the
goodness

the
clan
comprehending
the
order
more
from

than
the
words
and
seeing
the
prince
himself
present
hastened
to
dress
their
ranks

in

but
poor
macwheeble
who
with
a
sword
stuck
across
him
and
a
white
cockade
as
large
as
a
pancake
now
figured
in
the
character
of
a
commissary
being
overturned
in
the
bustle
occasioned
by
the
troopers
hastening
to
get
themselves
in
order
in
the
presence
before
he
could
rally
his
galloway
slunk
to
the
rear
amid
the
unrestrained
laughter
of
the
spectators

par

je
puis
plus
the
baron
of
bradwardine
was
obliged
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
monsieur
de
beaujeu
after
he
had
fairly
expended
his
few
english
military
phrases
one
purpose
of
the
chevalier
was
thus
answered
the
other
he
proposed
was
that
in
the
eagerness
to
hear
and
comprehend
commands
issued
through
such
an
indistinct
medium
in
his
own
presence
the
thoughts
of
the
soldiers
in
both
corps
might
get
a
current
different
from
the
angry
channel
in
which
they
were
flowing
at
the
time
charles
edward
was
no
sooner
left
with
the
chieftain
and
waverley
the
rest
of
his
attendants
being
at
some
distance
than
he
said
i
owed
less
to
your
disinterested
friendship
i
could
be
most
seriously
angry
with
both
of
you
for
this
very
extraordinary
and
causeless
broil
at
a
moment
when
my
father
service
so
decidedly
demands
the
most
perfect
unanimity
but
the
worst
of
my
situation
is
that
my
very
best
friends
hold
they
have
liberty
to
ruin
themselves
as
well
as
the
cause
they
are
engaged
in
upon
the
slightest
caprice
both
the
young
men
protested
their
resolution
to
submit
every
difference
to
his
arbitration
said
edward
hardly
know
of
what
i
am
accused
i
sought
colonel
merely
to
mention
to
him
that
i
had
narrowly
escaped
assassination
at
the
hand
of
his
immediate
dependent
a
dastardly
revenge
which
i
knew
him
to
be
incapable
of
authorising
as
to
the
cause
for
which
he
is
disposed
to
fasten
a
quarrel
upon
me
i
am
ignorant
of
it
unless
it
be
that
he
accuses
me
most
unjustly
of
having
engaged
the
affections
of
a
young
lady
in
prejudice
of
his
pretensions
there
is
an
error
said
the
chieftain
arises
from
a
conversation
which
i
held
this
morning
with
his
royal
highness
himself
me
said
the
chevalier
can
colonel
have
so
far
misunderstood
me
he
then
led
fergus
aside
and
after
five
minutes
earnest
conversation
spurred
his
horse
towards
edward
it
possible
nay
ride
up
colonel
for
i
desire
no
secrets
is
it
possible
waverley
that
i
am
mistaken
in
supposing
that
you
are
an
accepted
lover
of
miss
bradwardine
a
fact
of
which
i
was
by
circumstances
though
not
by
communication
from
you
so
absolutely
convinced
that
i
alleged
it
to
vich
ian
vohr
this
morning
as
a
reason
why
without
offence
to
him
you
might
not
continue
to
be
ambitious
of
an
alliance
which
to
an
unengaged
person
even
though
once
repulsed
holds
out
too
many
charms
to
be
lightly
laid
aside
royal
highness
said
waverley
have
founded
on
circumstances
altogether
unknown
to
me
when
you
did
me
the
distinguished
honour
of
supposing
me
an
accepted
lover
of
miss
bradwardine
i
feel
the
distinction
implied
in
the
supposition
but
i
have
no
title
to
it
for
the
rest
my
confidence
in
my
own
merit
is
too
justly
slight
to
admit
of
my
hoping
for
success
in
any
quarter
after
positive
rejection
the
chevalier
was
silent
for
a
moment
looking
steadily
at
them
both
and
then
said
my
word
waverley
you
are
a
less
happy
man
than
i
conceived
i
had
very
good
reason
to
believe
you
but
now
gentlemen
allow
me
to
be
umpire
in
this
matter
not
as
prince
regent
but
as
charles
stuart
a
brother
adventurer
with
you
in
the
same
gallant
cause
lay
my
pretensions
to
be
obeyed
by
you
entirely
out
of
view
and
consider
your
own
honour
and
how
far
it
is
well
or
becoming
to
give
our
enemies
the
advantage
and
our
friends
the
scandal
of
showing
that
few
as
we
are
we
are
not
united
and
forgive
me
if
i
add
that
the
names
of
the
ladies
who
have
been
mentioned
crave
more
respect
from
us
all
than
to
be
made
themes
of
discord
he
took
fergus
a
little
apart
and
spoke
to
him
very
earnestly
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
then
returning
to
waverley
said
believe
i
have
satisfied
colonel
that
his
resentment
was
founded
upon
a
misconception
to
which
indeed
i
myself
gave
rise
and
i
trust
waverley
is
too
generous
to
harbour
any
recollection
of
what
is
past
when
i
assure
him
that
such
is
the
case
you
must
state
this
matter
properly
to
your
clan

to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
their
precipitate
violence
fergus
bowed
now
gentlemen
let
me
have
the
pleasure
to
see
you
shake
hands
they
advanced
coldly
and
with
measured
steps
each
apparently
reluctant
to
appear
most
forward
in
concession
they
did
however
shake
hands
and
parted
taking
a
respectful
leave
of
the
chevalier

then
rode
to
the
head
of
the
macivors
threw
himself
from
his
horse
begged
a
drink
out
of
old
ballenkeiroch
cantine
and
marched
about
half
a
mile
along
with
them
inquiring
into
the
history
and
connexions
of
sliochd
nan
ivor
adroitly
using
the
few
words
of
gaelic
he
possessed
and
affecting
a
great
desire
to
learn
it
more
thoroughly
he
then
mounted
his
horse
once
more
and
galloped
to
the
baron
cavalry
which
was
in
front
halted
them
and
examined
their
accoutrements
and
state
of
discipline
took
notice
of
the
principal
gentlemen
and
even
of
the
cadets
inquired
after
their
ladies
and
commended
their
horses
rode
about
an
hour
with
the
baron
of
bradwardine
and
endured
three
long
stories
about
the
duke
of

as
he
returned
to
his

ennuyant

le

apres
tout
chapter
lix
a
skirmish
theeader
need
hardly
be
reminded
that
after
a
council
of
war
held
at
derby
on
the
of
december
the
highlanders
relinquished
their
desperate
attempt
to
penetrate
farther
into
england
and
greatly
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
their
young
and
daring
leader
positively
determined
to
return
northward
they
commenced
their
retreat
accordingly
and
by
the
extreme
celerity
of
their
movements
outstripped
the
motions
of
the
duke
of
cumberland
who
now
pursued
them
with
a
very
large
body
of
cavalry
this
retreat
was
a
virtual
resignation
of
their
towering
hopes
none
had
been
so
sanguine
as
fergus
macivor
none
consequently
was
so
cruelly
mortified
at
the
change
of
measures
he
argued
or
rather
remonstrated
with
the
utmost
vehemence
at
the
council
of
war
and
when
his
opinion
was
rejected
shed
tears
of
grief
and
indignation
from
that
moment
his
whole
manner
was
so
much
altered
that
he
could
scarcely
have
been
recognised
for
the
same
soaring
and
ardent
spirit
for
whom
the
whole
earth
seemed
too
narrow
but
a
week
before
the
retreat
had
continued
for
several
days
when
edward
to
his
surprise
early
on
the
of
december
received
a
visit
from
the
chieftain
in
his
quarters
in
a
hamlet
about
way
between
shap
and
penrith
having
had
no
intercourse
with
the
chieftain
since
their
rupture
edward
waited
with
some
anxiety
an
explanation
of
this
unexpected
visit
nor
could
he
help
being
surprised
and
somewhat
shocked
with
the
change
in
his
appearance
his
eye
had
lost
much
of
its
fire
his
cheek
was
hollow
his
voice
was
languid
even
his
gait
seemed
less
firm
and
elastic
than
it
was
wont
and
his
dress
to
which
he
used
to
be
particularly
attentive
was
now
carelessly
flung
about
him
he
invited
edward
to
walk
out
with
him
by
the
little
river
in
the
vicinity
and
smiled
in
a
melancholy
manner
when
he
observed
him
take
down
and
buckle
on
his
sword
as
soon
as
they
were
in
a
wild
sequestered
path
by
the
side
of
the
stream
the
chief
broke
out
fine
adventure
is
now
totally
ruined
waverley
and
i
wish
to
know
what
you
intend
to
do
nay
never
stare
at
me
man
i
tell
you
i
received
a
packet
from
my
sister
yesterday
and
had
i
got
the
information
it
contains
sooner
it
would
have
prevented
a
quarrel
which
i
am
always
vexed
when
i
think
of
in
a
letter
written
after
our
dispute
i
acquainted
her
with
the
cause
of
it
and
she
now
replies
to
me
that
she
never
had
nor
could
have
any
purpose
of
giving
you
encouragement
so
that
it
seems
i
have
acted
like
a
madman
poor
flora
she
writes
in
high
spirits
what
a
change
will
the
news
of
this
unhappy
retreat
make
in
her
state
of
mind
waverley
who
was
really
much
affected
by
the
deep
tone
of
melancholy
with
which
fergus
spoke
affectionately
entreated
him
to
banish
from
his
remembrance
any
unkindness
which
had
arisen
between
them
and
they
once
more
shook
hands
but
now
with
sincere
cordiality
fergus
again
inquired
of
waverley
what
he
intended
to
do
you
not
better
leave
this
luckless
army
and
get
down
before
us
into
scotland
and
embark
for
the
continent
from
some
of
the
eastern
ports
that
are
still
in
our
possession
when
you
are
out
of
the
kingdom
your
friends
will
easily
negotiate
your
pardon
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
wish
you
would
carry
rose
bradwardine
with
you
as
your
wife
and
take
flora
also
under
your
joint
protection
edward
looked
loves
you
and
i
believe
you
love
her
though
perhaps
you
have
not
found
it
out
for
you
are
not
celebrated
for
knowing
your
own
mind
very
pointedly
he
said
this
with
a
sort
of
smile
answered
edward
you
advise
me
to
desert
the
expedition
in
which
we
are
all
embarked
said
fergus
vessel
is
going
to
pieces
and
it
is
full
time
for
all
who
can
to
get
into
the
and
leave
her
what
will
other
gentlemen
do
answered
waverley
why
did
the
highland
chiefs
consent
to
this
retreat
if
it
is
so
ruinous
replied
think
that
as
on
former
occasions
the
heading
hanging
and
forfeiting
will
chiefly
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
lowland
gentry
that
they
will
be
left
secure
in
their
poverty
and
their
fastnesses
there
according
to
their
proverb
to
listen
to
the
wind
upon
the
hill
till
the
waters
abate
but
they
will
be
disappointed
they
have
been
too
often
troublesome
to
be
so
repeatedly
passed
over
and
this
time
john
bull
has
been
too
heartily
frightened
to
recover
his
for
some
time
the
hanoverian
ministers
always
deserved
to
be
hanged
for
rascals
but
now
if
they
get
the
power
in
their
hands
as
sooner
or
later
they
must
since
there
is
neither
rising
in
england
nor
assistance
from
france
they
will
deserve
the
gallows
as
fools
if
they
leave
a
single
clan
in
the
highlands
in
a
situation
to
be
again
troublesome
to
government
ay
they
will
make
work
i
warrant
them
while
you
recommend
flight
to
me
said
edward
counsel
which
i
would
rather
die
than
embrace
what
are
your
own
views
answered
fergus
with
a
melancholy
air
fate
is
settled
dead
or
captive
i
must
be
before
tomorrow
do
you
mean
by
that
my
friend
said
edward
enemy
is
still
a
day
march
in
our
rear
and
if
he
comes
up
we
are
still
strong
enough
to
keep
him
in
check
remember
gladsmuir
i
tell
you
is
true
notwithstanding
so
far
as
i
am
individually
concerned
what
authority
can
you
found
so
melancholy
a
prediction
asked
waverley
one
which
never
failed
a
person
of
my
house
i
have
seen
he
said
lowering
his
voice
have
seen
the
bodach
glas
glas
have
you
been
so
long
at
glennaquoich
and
never
heard
of
the
grey
spectre
though
indeed
there
is
a
certain
reluctance
among
us
to
mention
him
never
it
would
have
been
a
tale
for
poor
flora
to
have
told
you
or
if
that
hill
were
benmore
and
that
long
blue
lake
which
you
see
just
winding
towards
yon
mountainous
country
were
loch
tay
or
my
own
loch
an
ri
the
tale
would
be
better
suited
with
scenery
however
let
us
sit
down
on
this
knoll
even
saddleback
and
ulswater
will
suit
what
i
have
to
say
better
than
the
english
hedgerows
enclosures
and
farmhouses
you
must
know
then
that
when
my
ancestor
ian
nan
chaistel
wasted
northumberland
there
was
associated
with
him
in
the
expedition
a
sort
of
southland
chief
or
captain
of
a
band
of
lowlanders
called
halbert
hall
in
their
return
through
the
cheviots
they
quarrelled
about
the
division
of
the
great
booty
they
had
acquired
and
came
from
words
to
blows
the
lowlanders
were
cut
off
to
a
man
and
their
chief
fell
the
last
covered
with
wounds
by
the
sword
of
my
ancestor
since
that
time
his
spirit
has
crossed
the
vich
ian
vohr
of
the
day
when
any
great
disaster
was
impending
but
especially
before
approaching
death
my
father
saw
him
twice
once
before
he
was
made
prisoner
at
another
time
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
he
died
can
you
my
dear
fergus
tell
such
nonsense
with
a
grave
face
i
do
not
ask
you
to
believe
it
but
i
tell
you
the
truth
ascertained
by
three
hundred
years
experience
at
least
and
last
night
by
my
own
eyes
particulars
for
heaven
sake
said
waverley
with
eagerness
will
on
condition
you
will
not
attempt
a
jest
on
the
subject
since
this
unhappy
retreat
commenced
i
have
scarce
ever
been
able
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
my
clan
and
of
this
poor
prince
whom
they
are
leading
back
like
a
dog
in
a
string
whether
he
will
or
no
and
of
the
downfall
of
my
family
last
night
i
felt
so
feverish
that
i
left
my
quarters
and
walked
out
in
hopes
the
keen
frosty
air
would
brace
my
nerves
i
can
not
tell
how
much
i
dislike
going
on
for
i
know
you
will
hardly
believe
me
however
i
crossed
a
small
footbridge
and
kept
walking
backwards
and
forwards
when
i
observed
with
surprise
by
the
clear
moonlight
a
tall
figure
in
a
grey
plaid
such
as
shepherds
wear
in
the
south
of
scotland
which
move
at
what
pace
i
would
kept
regularly
about
four
yards
before
me
saw
a
cumberland
peasant
in
his
ordinary
dress
probably
i
thought
so
at
first
and
was
astonished
at
the
audacity
in
daring
to
dog
me
i
called
to
him
but
received
no
answer
i
felt
an
anxious
throbbing
at
my
heart
and
to
ascertain
what
i
dreaded
i
stood
still
and
turned
myself
on
the
same
spot
successively
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
by
heaven
edward
turn
where
i
would
the
figure
was
instantly
before
my
eyes
at
precisely
the
same
distance
i
was
then
convinced
it
was
the
bodach
glas
my
hair
bristled
and
my
knees
shook
i
manned
myself
however
and
determined
to
return
to
my
quarters
my
ghastly
visitant
glided
before
me
for
i
can
not
say
he
walked
until
he
reached
the
footbridge
there
he
stopped
and
turned
full
round
i
must
either
wade
the
river
or
pass
him
as
close
as
i
am
to
you
a
desperate
courage
founded
on
the
belief
that
my
death
was
near
made
me
resolve
to
make
my
way
in
despite
of
him
i
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
drew
my
sword
and
uttered
in
the
name
of
god
evil
spirit
give
place
vich
ian
vohr
it
said
in
a
voice
that
made
my
very
blood
curdle
beware
of
it
seemed
at
that
moment
not
half
a
yard
from
my
sword
point
but
the
words
were
no
sooner
spoken
than
it
was
gone
and
nothing
appeared
further
to
obstruct
my
passage
i
got
home
and
threw
myself
on
my
bed
where
i
spent
a
few
hours
heavily
enough
and
this
morning
as
no
enemy
was
reported
to
be
near
us
i
took
my
horse
and
rode
forward
to
make
up
matters
with
you
i
would
not
willingly
fall
until
i
am
in
charity
with
a
wronged
friend
edward
had
little
doubt
that
this
phantom
was
the
operation
of
an
exhausted
frame
and
depressed
spirits
working
on
the
belief
common
to
all
highlanders
in
such
superstitions
he
did
not
the
less
pity
fergus
for
whom
in
his
present
distress
he
felt
all
his
former
regard
revive
with
the
view
of
diverting
his
mind
from
these
gloomy
images
he
offered
with
the
baron
permission
which
he
knew
he
could
readily
obtain
to
remain
in
his
quarters
till
fergus
corps
should
come
up
and
then
to
march
with
them
as
usual
the
chief
seemed
much
pleased
yet
hesitated
to
accept
the
offer
are
you
know
in
the
rear
the
post
of
danger
in
a
retreat
therefore
the
post
of
honour
replied
the
chieftain
alick
have
your
horse
in
readiness
in
case
we
should
be
overmatched
and
i
shall
be
delighted
to
have
your
company

more
the
were
late
in
making
their
appearance
having
been
delayed
by
various
accidents
and
by
the
badness
of
the
roads
at
length
they
entered
the
hamlet
when
waverley
joined
the
clan
ivor
with
their
chieftain
all
the
resentment
they
had
entertained
against
him
seemed
blown
off
at
once
evan
dhu
received
him
with
a
grin
of
congratulation
and
even
callum
who
was
running
about
as
active
as
ever
pale
indeed
and
with
a
great
patch
on
his
head
appeared
delighted
to
see
him

fergus
be
harder
than

the
lock
of
the
pistol
was
actually
broken
could
you
strike
so
young
a
lad
so
hard
said
waverley
with
some
interest
if
i
did
not
strike
hard
sometimes
the
rascals
would
forget
themselves
they
were
now
in
full
march
every
caution
being
taken
to
prevent
surprise
fergus
people
and
a
fine
clan

from

commanded
by
cluny
had
the
rear
they
had
passed
a
large
open
moor
and
were
entering
into
the
enclosures
which
surround
a
small
village
called
clifton
the
winter
sun
had
set
and
edward
began
to
rally
fergus
upon
the
false
predictions
of
the
grey
spirit
ides
of
march
are
not
past
said
with
a
smile
when
suddenly
casting
his
eyes
back
on
the
moor
a
large
body
of
cavalry
was
indistinctly
seen
to
hover
upon
its
brown
and
dark
surface
to
line
the
enclosures
facing
the
open
ground
and
the
road
by
which
the
enemy
must
move
from
it
upon
the
village
was
the
work
of
a
short
time
while
these
manoeuvres
were
accomplishing
night
sunk
down
dark
and
gloomy
though
the
moon
was
at
full
sometimes
however
she
gleamed
forth
a
dubious
light
upon
the
scene
of
action
the
highlanders
did
not
long
remain
undisturbed
in
the
defensive
position
they
had
adopted
favoured
by
the
night
one
large
body
of
dismounted
dragoons
attempted
to
force
the
enclosures
while
another
equally
strong
strove
to
penetrate
by
the
highroad
both
were
received
by
such
a
heavy
fire
as
disconcerted
their
ranks
and
effectually
checked
their
progress
unsatisfied
with
the
advantage
thus
gained
fergus
to
whose
ardent
spirit
the
approach
of
danger
seemed
to
restore
all
its
elasticity
drawing
his
sword
and
calling
out
encouraged
his
men
by
voice
and
example
to
break
through
the
hedge
which
divided
them
and
rush
down
upon
the
enemy
mingling
with
the
dismounted
dragoons
they
forced
them
at
the
to
fly
to
the
open
moor
where
a
considerable
number
were
cut
to
pieces
but
the
moon
which
suddenly
shone
out
showed
to
the
english
the
small
number
of
assailants
disordered
by
their
own
success
two
squadrons
of
horse
moving
to
the
support
of
their
companions
the
highlanders
endeavoured
to
recover
the
enclosures
but
several
of
them
amongst
others
their
brave
chieftain
were
cut
off
and
surrounded
before
they
could
effect
their
purpose
waverley
looking
eagerly
for
fergus
from
whom
as
well
as
from
the
retreating
body
of
his
followers
he
had
been
separated
in
the
darkness
and
tumult
saw
him
with
evan
dhu
and
callum
defending
themselves
desperately
against
a
dozen
of
horsemen
who
were
hewing
at
them
with
their
long
broadswords
the
moon
was
again
at
that
moment
totally
overclouded
and
edward
in
the
obscurity
could
neither
bring
aid
to
his
friends
nor
discover
which
way
lay
his
own
road
to
rejoin
the
after
once
or
twice
narrowly
escaping

chapter
of
accidents
edward
was
in
a
most
unpleasant
and
dangerous
situation
he
soon
lost
the
sound
of
the
bagpipes
and
what
was
yet
more
unpleasant
when
after
searching
long
in
vain
and
scrambling
through
many
enclosures
he
at
length
approached
the
highroad
he
learned
from
the
unwelcome
noise
of
kettledrums
and
trumpets
that
the
english
cavalry
now
occupied
it
and
consequently
were
between
him
and
the
highlanders
precluded
therefore
from
advancing
in
a
straight
direction
he
resolved
to
avoid
the
english
military
and
endeavour
to
join
his
friends
by
making
a
circuit
to
the
left
for
which
a
beaten
path
deviating
from
the
main
road
in
that
direction
seemed
to
afford
facilities
the
path
was
muddy
and
the
night
dark
and
cold
but
even
these
inconveniences
were
hardly
felt
amidst
the
apprehensions
which
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
forces
reasonably
excited
in
his
bosom
after
walking
about
three
miles
he
at
length
reached
a
hamlet
conscious
that
the
common
people
were
in
general
unfavourable
to
the
cause
he
had
espoused
yet
desirous
if
possible
to
procure
a
horse
and
guide
to
penrith
where
he
hoped
to
find
the
rear
if
not
the
main
body
of
the
chevalier
army
he
approached
the
alehouse
of
the
place
there
was
a
great
noise
within
he
paused
to
listen
a
round
english
oath
or
two
and
the
burden
of
a
campaign
song
convinced
him
the
hamlet
also
was
occupied
by
the
duke
of
cumberland
soldiers
endeavouring
to
retire
from
it
as
softly
as
possible
and
blessing
the
obscurity
which
hitherto
he
had
murmured
against
waverley
groped
his
way
the
best
he
could
along
a
small
paling
which
seemed
the
boundary
of
some
cottage
garden
as
he
reached
the
gate
of
this
little
enclosure
his
outstretched
hand
was
grasped
by
that
of
a
female
whose
voice
at
the
same
time
uttered
thou
man
is
some
unlucky
mistake
thought
edward
struggling
but
gently
to
disengage
himself
o
thy
foun
now
man
or
the
red
cwoats
will
hear
thee
they
hae
been
houlerying
and
poulerying
every
ane
that
past
alehouse
door
this
noight
to
make
them
drive
their
waggons
and
sick
loike
come
into
feyther
or
they
do
ho
a
mischief
good
hint
thought
waverley
following
the
girl
through
the
little
garden
into
a
kitchen
where
she
set
herself
to
kindle
a
match
at
an
expiring
fire
and
with
the
match
to
light
a
candle
she
had
no
sooner
looked
on
edward
than
she
dropped
the
light
with
a
shrill
scream
of
feyther
feyther
the
father
thus
invoked
speedily
appeared
a
sturdy
old
farmer
in
a
pair
of
leather
breeches
and
boots
pulled
on
without
stockings
having
just
started
from
his
bed
the
rest
of
his
dress
was
only
a
westmoreland
statesman
that
is
his
shirt
his
figure
was
displayed
to
advantage
by
a
candle
which
he
bore
in
his
left
hand
in
his
right
he
brandished
a
poker
hast
ho

wench
cried
the
poor
girl
almost
going
off
in
hysterics
thought
it
was
ned
williams
and
it
is
one
of
the
what
was
thee
ganging
to
do
wi
ned
williams
at
this
time
noight
to
this
which
was
perhaps
one
of
the
numerous
class
of
questions
more
easily
asked
than
answered
the
damsel
made
no
reply
but
continued
sobbing
and
wringing
her
hands
thee

that
the

that

mon

my

said
waverley
if
you
can
assist
me
i
will
reward
you
handsomely
i
am
no
scotchman
but
an
unfortunate
english
gentleman
ho
scot
or
no
said
the
honest
farmer
wish
thou
hadst
kept
the
other
side
of
the
hallan
but
since
thou
art
here
jacob
jopson
will
betray
no
man
bluid
and
the
plaids
were
gay
canny
and
did
not
do
so
much
mischief
when
they
were
here
yesterday
accordingly
he
set
seriously
about
sheltering
and
refreshing
our
hero
for
the
night
the
fire
was
speedily
rekindled
but
with
precaution
against
its
light
being
seen
from
without
the
jolly
yeoman
cut
a
rasher
of
bacon
which
cicely
soon
broiled
and
her
father
added
a
swingeing
tankard
of
his
best
ale
it
was
settled
that
edward
should
remain
there
till
the
troops
marched
in
the
morning
then
hire
or
buy
a
horse
from
the
farmer
and
with
the
best
directions
that
could
be
obtained
endeavour
to
overtake
his
friends
a
clean
though
coarse
bed
received
him
after
the
fatigues
of
this
unhappy
day
with
the
morning
arrived
the
news
that
the
highlanders
had
evacuated
penrith
and
marched
off
towards
carlisle
that
the
duke
of
cumberland
was
in
possession
of
penrith
and
that
detachments
of
his
army
covered
the
roads
in
every
direction
to
attempt
to
get
through
undiscovered
would
be
an
act
of
the
most
frantic
temerity
ned
williams
the
right
edward
was
now
called
to
council
by
cicely
and
her
father
ned
who
perhaps
did
not
care
that
his
handsome
namesake
should
remain
too
long
in
the
same
house
with
his
sweetheart
for
fear
of
fresh
mistakes
proposed
that
waverley
exchanging
his
uniform
and
plaid
for
the
dress
of
the
country
should
go
with
him
to
his
father
farm
near
ullswater
and
remain
in
that
undisturbed
retirement
until
the
military
movements
in
the
country
should
have
ceased
to
render
his
departure
hazardous
a
price
was
also
agreed
upon
at
which
the
stranger
might
board
with
farmer
williams
if
he
thought
proper
till
he
could
depart
with
safety
it
was
of
moderate
amount
the
distress
of
his
situation
among
this
honest
and
race
being
considered
as
no
reason
for
increasing
their
demand
the
necessary
articles
of
dress
were
accordingly
procured
and
by
following
known
to
the
young
farmer
they
hoped
to
escape
any
unpleasant
rencontre
a
recompense
for
their
hospitality
was
refused
peremptorily
by
old
jopson
and
his
daughter
a
kiss
paid
the
one
and
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
the
other
both
seemed
anxious
for
their
guest
safety
and
took
leave
of
him
with
kind
wishes
in
the
course
of
their
route
edward
with
his
guide
traversed
those
fields
which
the
night
before
had
been
the
scene
of
action
a
brief
gleam
of
december
sun
shone
sadly
on
the
broad
heath
which
towards
the
spot
where
the
great
road
entered
the
enclosures
of
lord
lonsdale
property
exhibited
dead
bodies
of
men
and
horses
and
the
usual
companions
of
war
a
number
of
hawks
and
ravens
this
then
was
thy
last
field
said
waverley
to
himself
his
eye
filling
at
the
recollection
of
the
many
splendid
points
of
fergus
character
and
of
their
former
intimacy
all
his
passions
and
imperfections
forgotten
fell
the
last
vich
ian
vohr
on
a
nameless
heath
and
in
an
obscure
was
quenched
that
ardent
spirit
who
thought
it
little
to
cut
a
way
for
his
master
to
the
british
throne
ambition
policy
bravery
all
far
beyond
their
sphere
here
learned
the
fate
of
mortals
the
sole
support
too
of
a
sister
whose
spirit
as
proud
and
unbending
was
even
more
exalted
than
thine
own
here
ended
all
thy
hopes
for
flora
and
the
long
and
valued
line
which
it
was
thy
boast
to
raise
yet
more
highly
by
thy
adventurous
valour
as
these
ideas
pressed
on
waverley
mind
he
resolved
to
go
upon
the
open
heath
and
search
if
among
the
slain
he
could
discover
the
body
of
his
friend
with
the
pious
intention
of
procuring
for
him
the
last
rites
of
sepulture
the
timorous
young
man
who
accompanied
him
remonstrated
upon
the
danger
of
the
attempt
but
edward
was
determined
the
followers
of
the
camp
had
already
stripped
the
dead
of
all
they
could
carry
away
but
the
country
people
unused
to
scenes
of
blood
had
not
yet
approached
the
field
of
action
though
some
stood
fearfully
gazing
at
a
distance
about
sixty
or
seventy
dragoons
lay
slain
within
the
first
enclosure
upon
the
highroad
and
on
the
open
moor
of
the
highlanders
not
above
a
dozen
had
fallen
chiefly
those
who
venturing
too
far
on
the
moor
could
not
regain
the
strong
ground
he
could
not
find
the
body
of
fergus
among
the
slain
on
a
little
knoll
separated
from
the
others
lay
the
carcasses
of
three
english
dragoons
two
horses
and
the
page
callum
beg
whose
hard
skull
a
trooper
broadsword
had
at
length
effectually
cloven
it
was
possible
his
clan
had
carried
off
the
body
of
fergus
but
it
was
also
possible
he
had
escaped
especially
as
evan
dhu
who
would
never
leave
his
chief
was
not
found
among
the
dead
or
he
might
be
prisoner
and
the
less
formidable
denunciation
inferred
from
the
appearance
of
the
bodach
glas
might
have
proved
the
true
one
the
approach
of
a
party
sent
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
the
country
people
to
bury
the
dead
and
who
had
already
assembled
several
peasants
for
that
purpose
now
obliged
edward
to
rejoin
his
guide
who
awaited
him
in
great
anxiety
and
fear
under
shade
of
the
plantations
after
leaving
this
field
of
death
the
rest
of
their
journey
was
happily
accomplished
at
the
house
of
farmer
williams
edward
passed
for
a
young
kinsman
educated
for
the
church
who
was
come
to
reside
there
till
the
civil
tumults
permitted
him
to
pass
through
the
country
this
silenced
suspicion
among
the
kind
and
simple
yeomanry
of
cumberland
and
accounted
sufficiently
for
the
grave
manners
and
retired
habits
of
the
new
guest
the
precaution
became
more
necessary
than
waverley
had
anticipated
as
a
variety
of
incidents
prolonged
his
stay
at
fasthwaite
as
the
farm
was
called
a
tremendous
fall
of
snow
rendered
his
departure
impossible
for
more
than
ten
days
when
the
roads
began
to
become
a
little
practicable
they
successively
received
news
of
the
retreat
of
the
chevalier
into
scotland
then
that
he
had
abandoned
the
frontiers
retiring
upon
glasgow
and
that
the
duke
of
cumberland
had
formed
the
siege
of
carlisle
his
army
therefore
cut
off
all
possibility
of
waverley
escaping
into
scotland
in
that
direction
on
the
eastern
border
marshal
wade
with
a
large
force
was
advancing
upon
edinburgh
and
all
along
the
frontier
parties
of
militia
volunteers
and
partizans
were
in
arms
to
suppress
insurrection
and
apprehend
such
stragglers
from
the
highland
army
as
had
been
left
in
england
the
surrender
of
carlisle
and
the
severity
with
which
the
rebel
garrison
were
threatened
soon
formed
an
additional
reason
against
venturing
upon
a
solitary
and
hopeless
journey
through
a
hostile
country
and
a
large
army
to
carry
the
assistance
of
a
single
sword
to
a
cause
which
seemed
altogether
desperate
in
this
lonely
and
secluded
situation
without
the
advantage
of
company
or
conversation
with
men
of
cultivated
minds
the
arguments
of
colonel
talbot
often
recurred
to
the
mind
of
our
hero
a
still
more
anxious
recollection
haunted
his
slumbers
it
was
the
dying
look
and
gesture
of
colonel
gardiner
most
devoutly
did
he
hope
as
the
rarely
occurring
post
brought
news
of
skirmishes
with
various
success
that
it
might
never
again
be
his
lot
to
draw
his
sword
in
civil
conflict
then
his
mind
turned
to
the
supposed
death
of
fergus
to
the
desolate
situation
of
flora
and
with
yet
more
tender
recollection
to
that
of
rose
bradwardine
who
was
destitute
of
the
devoted
enthusiasm
of
loyalty
which
to
her
friend
hallowed
and
exalted
misfortune
these
reveries
he
was
permitted
to
enjoy
undisturbed
by
queries
or
interruption
and
it
was
in
many
a
winter
walk
by
the
shores
of
ullswater
that
he
acquired
a
more
complete
mastery
of
a
spirit
tamed
by
adversity
than
his
former
experience
had
given
him
and
that
he
felt
himself
entitled
to
say
firmly
though
perhaps
with
a
sigh
that
the
romance
of
his
life
was
ended
and
that
its
real
history
had
now
commenced
he
was
soon
called
upon
to
justify
his
pretensions
by
reason
and
philosophy
chapter
lxi
a
journey
to
london
theamily
at
fasthwaite
were
soon
attached
to
edward
he
had
indeed
that
gentleness
and
urbanity
which
almost
universally
attracts
corresponding
kindness
and
to
their
simple
ideas
his
learning
gave
him
consequence
and
his
sorrows
interest
the
last
he
ascribed
evasively
to
the
loss
of
a
brother
in
the
skirmish
near
clifton

in
that
primitive
state
of
society
where
the

affection
were
highly
deemed
of

continued
depression

sympathy
but
not
surprise
in
the
end
of

more
lively
powers
were
called
out
by
the
happy
union
of
edward
williams
the
son
of
his
host
with
cicely
jopson
our
hero
would
not
cloud
with
sorrow
the
festivity
attending
the
wedding
of
two
persons
to
whom
he
was
so
highly
obliged
he
therefore
exerted
himself
danced
sung
played
at
the
various
games
of
the
day
and
was
the
blithest
of
the
company
the
next
morning
however
he
had
more
serious
matters
to
think
of
the
clergyman
who
had
married
the
young
couple
was
so
much
pleased
with
the
supposed
student
of
divinity
that
he
came
next
day
from
penrith
on
purpose
to
pay
him
a
visit
this
might
have
been
a
puzzling
chapter
had
he
entered
into
any
examination
of
our
supposed
theological
studies
but
fortunately
he
loved
better
to
hear
and
communicate
the
news
of
the
day
he
brought
with
him
two
or
three
old
newspapers
in
one
of
which
edward
found
a
piece
of
intelligence
that
soon
rendered
him
deaf
to
every
word
which
the
reverend
twigtythe
was
saying
upon
the
news
from
the
north
and
the
prospect
of
the
duke
speedily
overtaking
and
crushing
the
rebels
this
was
an
article
in
these
or
nearly
these
words
at
his
house
in

upon
the
richard
waverley
second
son
of
sir
giles
waverley
of

etc
he
died
of
a
lingering
disorder
augmented
by
the
unpleasant
predicament
of
suspicion
in
which
he
stood
having
been
obliged
to
find
bail
to
a
high
amount
to
meet
an
impending
accusation
of
an
accusation
of
the
same
grave
crime
hangs
over
his
elder
brother
sir
everard
waverley
the
representative
of
that
ancient
family
and
we
understand
the
day
of
his
trial
will
be
fixed
early
in
the
next
month
unless
edward
waverley
son
of
the
deceased
richard
and
heir
to
the
baronet
shall
surrender
himself
to
justice
in
that
case
we
are
assured
it
is
his
majesty
gracious
purpose
to
drop
further
proceedings
upon
the
charge
against
sir
everard
this
unfortunate
young
gentleman
is
ascertained
to
have
been
in
arms
in
the
pretender
service
and
to
have
marched
along
with
the
highland
troops
into
england
but
he
has
not
been
heard
of
since
the
skirmish
at
clifton
on
the
december
last
such
was
this
distracting
paragraph
god
exclaimed
waverley
i
then
a
parricide
impossible
my
father
who
never
showed
the
affection
of
a
father
while
he
lived
can
not
have
been
so
much
affected
by
my
supposed
death
as
to
hasten
his
own
no
i
will
not
believe
it
it
were
distraction
to
entertain
for
a
moment
such
a
horrible
idea
but
it
were
if
possible
worse
than
parricide
to
suffer
any
danger
to
hang
over
my
noble
and
generous
uncle
who
has
ever
been
more
to
me
than
a
father
if
such
evil
can
be
averted
by
any
sacrifice
on
my
part
while
these
reflections
passed
like
the
stings
of
scorpions
through
waverley
sensorium
the
worthy
divine
was
startled
in
a
long
disquisition
on
the
battle
of
falkirk
by
the
ghastliness
which
they
communicated
to
his
looks
and
asked
him
if
he
was
ill
fortunately
the
bride
all
smirk
and
blush
had
just
entered
the
room
williams
was
none
of
the
brightest
of
women
but
she
was
and
readily
concluding
that
edward
had
been
shocked
by
disagreeable
news
in
the
papers
interfered
so
judiciously
that
without
exciting
suspicion
she
drew
off
twigtythe
attention
and
engaged
it
until
he
soon
after
took
his
leave
waverley
then
explained
to
his
friends
that
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
going
to
london
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
one
cause
of
delay
however
did
occur
to
which
waverley
had
been
very
little
accustomed
his
purse
though
well
stocked
when
he
first
went
to
had
not
been
reinforced
since
that
period
and
although
his
life
since
had
not
been
of
a
nature
to
exhaust
it
hastily
for
he
had
lived
chiefly
with
his
friends
or
with
the
army
yet
he
found
that
after
settling
with
his
kind
landlord
he
should
be
too
poor
to
encounter
the
expense
of
travelling
post
the
best
course
therefore
seemed
to
be
to
get
into
the
great
north
road
about
boroughbridge
and
there
take
a
place
in
the
northern
diligence
a
huge
tub
drawn
by
three
horses
which
completed
the
journey
from
edinburgh
to
london
god
willing
as
the
advertisement
expressed
it
in
three
weeks
our
hero
therefore
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
his
cumberland
friends
whose
kindness
he
promised
never
to
forget
and
tacitly
hoped
ene
day
to
acknowledge
by
substantial
proofs
of
gratitude
after
some
petty
difficulties
and
vexatious
delays
and
after
putting
his
dress
into
a
shape
better
befitting
his
rank
though
perfectly
plain
and
simple
he
accomplished
crossing
the
country
and
found
himself
in
the
desired
vehicle
to
nosebag
the
lady
of
lieutenant
nosebag
adjutant
and
master
of
the
dragoons
a
jolly
woman
of
about
fifty
wearing
a
blue
habit
faced
with
scarlet
and
grasping
a
this
lady
was
one
of
those
active
members
of
society
who
take
upon
them
faire
lefrais
de
la
conversation
she
had
just
returned
from
the
north
and
informed
edward
how
nearly
her
regiment
had
cut
the
petticoat
people
into
ribands
at
falkirk
somehow
there
was
one
of
those
nasty
awkward
marshes
that
they
are
never
without
in
scotland
i
think
and
so
our
poor
dear
little
regiment
suffered
something
as
my
nosebag
says
in
that
unsatisfactory
affair
you
sir
have
served
in
the
dragoons
waverley
was
taken
so
much
at
unawares
that
he
acquiesced
i
knew
it
at
once
i
saw
you
were
military
from
your
air
and
i
was
sure
you
could
be
none
of
the
as
my
nosebag
calls
them
what
regiment
pray
here
was
a
delightful
question
waverley
however
justly
concluded
that
this
good
lady
had
the
whole
by
heart
and
to
avoid
detection
by
adhering
to
truth
answered
dragoons
but
i
have
retired
some
time
aye
those
as
won
the
race
at
the
battle
of
preston
as
my
nosebag
says
pray
sir
were
you
there
was
so
unfortunate
madam
he
replied
to
witness
that
engagement
that
was
a
misfortune
that
few
of
gardiner
stood
to
witness
i
believe
sir
ha
ha
ha
i
beg
your
pardon
but
a
soldier
wife
loves
a
joke
confound
you
thought
waverley
infernal
luck
has
penned
me
up
with
this
inquisitive
hag
fortunately
the
good
lady
did
not
stick
long
to
one
subject
are
coming
to
ferrybridge
now
she
said
there
was
a
party
of
ours
left
to
support
the
beadles
and
constables
and
justices
and
these
sort
of
creatures
that
are
examining
papers
and
stopping
rebels
and
all
that
they
were
hardly
in
the
inn
before
she
dragged
waverley
to
the
window
exclaiming
comes
corporal
bridoon
of
our
poor
dear
troop
he
coming
with
the
constable
man
bridoon
one
of
my
lambs
as
nosebag
calls
come
a
a
pray
what
your
name
sir
said
waverley
resolved
rather
to
make
free
with
the
name
of
a
former
than
run
the
risk
of
detection
by
inventing
one
not
to
be
found
in
the
regiment
you
got
a
troop
lately
when
that
shabby
fellow
waverley
went
over
to
the
rebels
lord
i
wish
our
old
cross
captain
crump
would
go
over
to
the
rebels
that
nosebag
might
get
the
troop
lord
what
can
bridoon
be
standing
swinging
on
the
bridge
for
i
be
hanged
if
he
hazy
as
nosebag
says
come
sir
as
you
and
i
belong
to
the
service
we
go
put
the
rascal
in
mind
of
his
duty
waverley
with
feelings
more
easily
conceived
than
described
saw
himself
obliged
to
follow
this
doughty
female
commander
the
gallant
trooper
was
as
like
a
lamb
as
a
drunk
corporal
of
dragoons
about
six
feet
high
with
very
broad
shoulders
and
very
thin
legs
not
to
mention
a
great
scar
across
his
nose
could
well
be
nosebag
addressed
him
with
something
which
if
not
an
oath
sounded
very
like
one
and
commanded
him
to
attend
to
his
duty
be
d
d
for
a
commenced
the
gallant
cavalier
but
looking
up
in
order
to
suit
the
action
to
the
words
and
also
to
enforce
the
epithet
which
he
meditated
with
an
adjective
applicable
to
the
party
he
recognised
the
speaker
made
his
military
salaam
and
altered
his
tone
love
your
handsome
face
madam
nosebag
is
it
you
why
if
a
poor
fellow
does
happen
to
fire
a
slug
of
a
morning
i
am
sure
you
were
never
the
lady
to
bring
him
to
harm
you
rascallion
go
mind
your
duty
this
gentleman
and
i
belong
to
the
service
but
be
sure
you
look
after
that
shy
cock
in
the
slouched
hat
that
sits
in
the
corner
of
the
coach
i
believe
he
one
of
the
rebels
in
disguise
n
her
gooseberry
wig
said
the
corporal
when
she
was
out
of
hearing
jade
mother
adjutant
as
we
call
her
is
a
greater
plague
to
the
regiment
than
and
old
the
colonel
into
the
bargain
come
master
constable
let
see
if
this
shy
cock
as
she
calls
him
who
by
the
way
was
a
quaker
from
leeds
with
whom
nosebag
had
had
some
tart
argument
on
the
legality
of
bearing
arms
will
stand
godfather
to
a
sup
of
brandy
for
your
yorkshire
ale
is
cold
on
my
stomach
the
vivacity
of
this
good
lady
as
it
helped
edward
out
of
this
scrape
was
like
to
have
drawn
him
into
one
or
two
others
in
every
town
where
they
stopped
she
wished
to
examine
the
corps
de
garde
if
there
was
one
and
once
very
narrowly
missed
introducing
waverley
to
a
of
his
own
regiment
then
she
captain
and
butler
him
till
he
was
almost
mad
with
vexation
and
anxiety
and
never
was
he
more
rejoiced
in
his
life
at
the
termination
of
a
journey
than
when
the
arrival
of
the
coach
in
london
freed
him
from
the
attentions
of
madam
nosebag
chapter
lxii
what
to
be
done
next
itwas
twilight
when
they
arrived
in
town
and
having
shaken
off
his
companions
and
walked
through
a
good
many
streets
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
being
traced
by
them
edward
took
a
coach
and
drove
to
colonel
talbot
house
in
one
of
the
principal
squares
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
that
gentleman
by
the
death
of
relations
had
succeeded
since
his
marriage
to
a
large
fortune
possessed
considerable
political
interest
and
lived
in
what
is
called
great
style
when
waverley
knocked
at
his
door
he
found
it
at
first
difficult
to
procure
admittance
but
at
length
was
shown
into
an
apartment
where
the
colonel
was
at
table
lady
emily
whose
very
beautiful
features
were
still
pallid
from
indisposition
sate
opposite
to
him
the
instant
he
heard
waverley
voice
he
started
up
and
embraced
him
stanley
my
dear
boy
how
d
do
emily
my
love
this
is
young
stanley
the
blood
started
to
the
lady
cheek
as
she
gave
waverley
a
reception
in
which
courtesy
was
mingled
with
kindness
while
her
trembling
hand
and
faltering
voice
showed
how
much
she
was
startled
and
discomposed
dinner
was
hastily
replaced
and
while
waverley
was
engaged
in
refreshing
himself
the
colonel
proceeded
wonder
you
have
come
here
frank
the
doctors
tell
me
the
air
of
london
is
very
bad
for
your
complaints
you
should
not
have
risked
it
but
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
and
so
is
emily
though
i
fear
we
must
not
reckon
upon
your
staying
long
particular
business
brought
me
up
muttered
waverley
supposed
so
but
i
sha
allow
you
to
stay
long
spontoon
to
an
elderly
servant
out
of
livery
away
these
things
and
answer
the
bell
yourself
if
i
ring
do
let
any
of
the
other
fellows
disturb
us
my
nephew
and
i
have
business
to
talk
of
when
the
servants
had
retired
the
name
of
god
waverley
what
has
brought
you
here
it
may
be
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
waverley
said
lady
emily
whom
i
owe
so
much
more
than
acknowledgments
can
ever
pay
how
could
you
be
so
rash
father
my
uncle
this
paragraph
he
handed
the
paper
to
colonel
talbot
wish
to
heaven
these
scoundrels
were
condemned
to
be
squeezed
to
death
in
their
own
presses
said
talbot
am
told
there
are
not
less
than
a
dozen
of
their
papers
now
published
in
town
and
no
wonder
that
they
are
obliged
to
invent
lies
to
find
sale
for
their
journals
it
is
true
however
my
dear
edward
that
you
have
lost
your
father
but
as
to
this
flourish
of
his
unpleasant
situation
having
grated
upon
his
spirits
and
hurt
his
health
the
truth
is
for
though
it
is
harsh
to
say
so
now
yet
it
will
relieve
your
mind
from
the
idea
of
weighty
responsibility
the
truth
then
is
that
richard
waverley
through
this
whole
business
showed
great
want
of
sensibility
both
to
your
situation
and
that
of
your
uncle
and
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
told
me
with
great
glee
that
as
i
was
so
good
as
to
take
charge
of
your
interests
he
had
thought
it
best
to
patch
up
a
separate
negotiation
for
himself
and
make
his
peace
with
government
through
some
channels
which
former
connexions
left
still
open
to
him
my
uncle
my
dear
uncle
in
no
danger
whatever
it
is
true
looking
at
the
date
of
the
paper
there
was
a
foolish
report
some
time
ago
to
the
purport
here
quoted
but
it
is
entirely
false
sir
everard
is
gone
down
to
freed
from
all
uneasiness
unless
upon
your
own
account
but
you
are
in
peril
yourself
your
name
is
in
every
proclamation
warrants
are
out
to
apprehend
you
how
and
when
did
you
come
here
edward
told
his
story
at
length
suppressing
his
quarrel
with
fergus
for
being
himself
partial
to
highlanders
he
did
not
wish
to
give
any
advantage
to
the
colonel
national
prejudice
against
them
you
sure
it
was
your
friend
glen
you
saw
dead
in
clifton
moor
positive
that
little
limb
of
the
devil
has
cheated
the
gallows
for
was
written
in
his
face
though
turning
to
lady
emily
it
was
a
very
handsome
face
too
but
for
you
edward
i
wish
you
would
go
down
again
to
cumberland
or
rather
i
wish
you
had
never
stirred
from
thence
for
there
is
an
embargo
in
all
the
seaports
and
a
strict
search
for
the
adherents
of
the
pretender
and
the
tongue
of
that
confounded
woman
will
wag
in
her
head
like
the
clack
of
a
mill
till
somehow
or
other
she
will
detect
captain
butler
to
be
a
feigned
personage
you
know
anything
asked
waverley
my
husband
was
my
for
six
years
she
was
a
buxom
widow
with
a
little
money
he
married
her
was
steady
and
got
on
by
being
a
good
drill
i
must
send
spontoon
to
see
what
she
is
about
he
will
find
her
out
among
the
old
regimental
connections
you
must
be
indisposed
and
keep
your
room
from
fatigue
lady
emily
is
to
be
your
nurse
and
spontoon
and
i
your
attendants
you
bear
the
name
of
a
near
relation
of
mine
whom
none
of
my
present
people
ever
saw
except
spontoon
so
there
will
be
no
immediate
danger
so
pray
feel
your
head
ache
and
your
eyes
grow
heavy
as
soon
as
possible
that
you
may
be
put
upon
the
list
and
emily
do
you
order
an
apartment
for
frank
stanley
with
all
the
attentions
which
an
invalid
may
require
in
the
morning
the
colonel
visited
his
guest
said
he
have
some
good
news
for
you
your
reputation
as
a
gentleman
and
officer
is
effectually
cleared
of
neglect
of
duty
and
accession
to
the
mutiny
in
gardiner
regiment
i
have
had
a
correspondence
on
this
subject
with
a
very
zealous
friend
of
yours
your
scottish
parson
morton
his
first
letter
was
addressed
to
sir
everard
but
i
relieved
the
good
baronet
of
the
trouble
of
answering
it
you
must
know
that
your
acquaintance
donald
of
the
cave
has
at
length
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
he
was
driving
off
the
cattle
of
a
certain
proprietor
called
killan
something
or
other
same
now
the
gentleman
being
it
seems
a
great
farmer
and
having
a
special
value
for
his
breed
of
cattle
being
moreover
rather
of
a
timid
disposition
had
got
a
party
of
soldiers
to
protect
his
property
so
donald
ran
his
head
unawares
into
the
lion
mouth
and
was
defeated
and
made
prisoner
being
ordered
for
execution
his
conscience
was
assailed
on
the
one
hand
by
a
catholic
priest
on
the
other
by
your
friend
morton
he
repulsed
the
catholic
chiefly
on
account
of
the
doctrine
of
extreme
unction
which
this
economical
gentleman
considered
as
an
excessive
waste
of
oil
so
his
conversion
from
a
state
of
impenitence
fell
to
morton
share
who
i
daresay
acquitted
himself
excellently
though
i
suppose
donald
made
but
a
queer
kind
of
christian
after
all
he
confessed
however
before
a
magistrate
one
major
melville
who
seems
to
have
been
a
correct
friendly
sort
of
person
his
full
intrigue
with
houghton
explaining
particularly
how
it
was
carried
on
and
fully
acquitting
you
of
the
least
accession
to
it
he
also
mentioned
his
rescuing
you
from
the
hands
of
the
volunteer
officer
and
sending
you
by
orders
of
the
pret
chevalier
i
mean
as
a
prisoner
to
doune
from
whence
he
understood
you
were
carried
prisoner
to
edinburgh
these
are
particulars
which
can
not
but
tell
in
your
favour
he
hinted
that
he
had
been
employed
to
deliver
and
protect
you
and
rewarded
for
doing
so
but
he
would
not
confess
by
whom
alleging
that
though
he
would
not
have
minded
breaking
any
ordinary
oath
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
morton
to
whose
pious
admonitions
he
owed
so
much
yet
in
the
present
case
he
had
been
sworn
to
silence
upon
the
edge
of
his
dirk
footnote
see
note
which
it
seems
constituted
in
his
opinion
an
inviolable
obligation
what
is
become
of
him
he
was
hanged
at
stirling
after
the
rebels
raised
the
siege
with
his
lieutenant
and
four
plaids
besides
he
having
the
advantage
of
a
gallows
more
lofty
than
his
friends
i
have
little
cause
either
to
regret
or
rejoice
at
his
death
and
yet
he
has
done
me
both
good
and
harm
to
a
very
considerable
extent
confession
at
least
will
serve
you
materially
since
it
wipes
from
your
character
all
those
suspicions
which
gave
the
accusation
against
you
a
complexion
of
a
nature
different
from
that
with
which
so
many
unfortunate
gentlemen
now
or
lately
in
arms
against
the
government
may
be
justly
charged
their
treason
i
must
give
it
its
name
though
you
participate
in
its
guilt
is
an
action
arising
from
mistaken
virtue
and
therefore
can
not
be
classed
as
a
disgrace
though
it
be
doubtless
highly
criminal
where
the
guilty
are
so
numerous
clemency
must
be
extended
to
far
the
greater
number
and
i
have
little
doubt
of
procuring
a
remission
for
you
providing
we
can
keep
you
out
of
the
claws
of
justice
till
she
has
selected
and
gorged
upon
her
victims
for
in
this
as
in
other
cases
it
will
be
according
to
the
vulgar
proverb
first
come
first
served
besides
government
are
desirous
at
present
to
intimidate
the
english
jacobites
among
whom
they
can
find
few
examples
for
punishment
this
is
a
vindictive
and
timid
feeling
which
will
soon
wear
off
for
of
all
nations
the
english
are
least
by
nature
but
it
exists
at
present
and
you
must
therefore
be
kept
out
of
the
way
in
the
now
entered
spontoon
with
an
anxious
countenance
by
his
regimental
acquaintances
he
had
traced
out
madam
nosebag
and
found
her
full
of
ire
fuss
and
fidget
at
discovery
of
an
impostor
who
had
travelled
from
the
north
with
her
under
the
assumed
name
of
captain
butler
of
gardiner
dragoons
she
was
going
to
lodge
an
information
on
the
subject
to
have
him
sought
for
as
an
emissary
of
the
pretender
but
spontoon
an
old
soldier
while
he
pretended
to
approve
contrived
to
make
her
delay
her
intention
no
time
however
was
to
be
lost
the
accuracy
of
this
good
dame
description
might
probably
lead
to
the
discovery
that
waverley
was
the
pretended
captain
butler
an
identification
fraught
with
danger
to
edward
perhaps
to
his
uncle
and
even
to
colonel
talbot
which
way
to
direct
his
course
was
now
therefore
the
question
scotland
said
waverley
scotland
said
the
colonel
what
purpose
not
to
engage
again
with
the
rebels
i
hope
i
considered
my
campaign
ended
when
after
all
my
efforts
i
could
not
rejoin
them
and
now
by
all
accounts
they
are
gone
to
make
a
winter
campaign
in
the
highlands
where
such
adherents
as
i
am
would
rather
be
burdensome
than
useful
indeed
it
seems
likely
that
they
only
prolong
the
war
to
place
the
chevalier
person
out
of
danger
and
then
to
make
some
terms
for
themselves
to
burden
them
with
my
presence
would
merely
add
another
party
whom
they
would
not
give
up
and
could
not
defend
i
understand
they
left
almost
all
their
english
adherents
in
garrison
at
carlisle
for
that
very
reason
and
on
a
more
general
view
colonel
to
confess
the
truth
though
it
may
lower
me
in
your
opinion
i
am
heartly
tired
of
the
trade
of
war
and
am
as
fletcher
humorous
lieutenant
says
even
as
weary
of
this
pooh
what
have
you
seen
but
a
skirmish
or
two
ah
if
you
saw
war
on
the
grand
scale
sixty
or
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
field
on
each
side
am
not
at
all
curious
colonel
enough
says
our
homely
proverb
is
as
good
as
a
feast
the
plumed
troops
and
the
big
war
used
to
enchant
me
in
poetry
but
the
night
marches
vigils
couches
under
the
wintry
sky
and
such
accompaniments
of
the
glorious
trade
are
not
at
all
to
my
taste
in
practice
then
for
dry
blows
i
had
my
fill
of
fighting
at
clifton
where
i
escaped
by
a
half
a
dozen
times
and
you
i
should
think
he
stopped
enough
of
it
at
preston
you
mean
to
say
answered
the
colonel
laughing
is
my
vocation
hal
is
not
mine
though
said
waverley
having
honourably
got
rid
of
the
sword
which
i
drew
only
as
a
volunteer
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
my
military
experience
and
shall
be
in
no
hurry
to
take
it
up
again
am
very
glad
you
are
of
that
mind
but
then
what
would
you
do
in
the
north
the
first
place
there
are
some
seaports
on
the
eastern
coast
of
scotland
still
in
the
hands
of
the
chevalier
friends
should
i
gain
any
of
them
i
can
easily
embark
for
the
continent
your
second
reason
to
speak
the
very
truth
there
is
a
person
in
scotland
upon
whom
i
now
find
my
happiness
depends
more
than
i
was
always
aware
and
about
whose
situation
i
am
very
anxious
emily
was
right
and
there
is
a
love
affair
in
the
case
after
all
and
which
of
these
two
pretty
scotchwomen
whom
you
insisted
upon
my
admiring
is
the
distinguished
fair
not
miss
glen
i
hope
pass
for
the
other
simplicity
may
be
improved
but
pride
and
conceit
never
well
i
do
discourage
you
i
think
it
will
please
sir
everard
from
what
he
said
when
i
jested
with
him
about
it
only
i
hope
that
intolerable
papa
with
his
brogue
and
his
snuff
and
his
latin
and
his
insufferable
long
stories
about
the
duke
of
berwick
will
find
it
necessary
hereafter
to
be
an
inhabitant
of
foreign
parts
but
as
to
the
daughter
though
i
think
you
might
find
as
fitting
a
match
in
england
yet
if
your
heart
be
really
set
upon
this
scotch
rosebud
why
the
baronet
has
a
great
opinion
of
her
father
and
of
his
family
and
he
wishes
much
to
see
you
married
and
settled
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
that
of
the
three
ermines
passant
which
may
otherwise
pass
away
altogether
but
i
will
bring
you
his
mind
fully
upon
the
subject
since
you
are
debarred
correspondence
for
the
present
for
i
think
you
will
not
be
long
in
scotland
before
me
and
what
can
induce
you
to
think
of
returning
to
scotland
no
relenting
longings
towards
the
land
of
mountains
and
floods
i
am
afraid
on
my
word
but
emily
health
is
now
thank
god
reestablished
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
little
hopes
of
concluding
the
business
which
i
have
at
present
most
at
heart
until
i
can
have
a
personal
interview
with
his
royal
highness
the
for
as
fluellen
says
the
duke
doth
love
me
well
and
i
thank
heaven
i
have
deserved
some
love
at
his
hands
i
am
now
going
out
for
an
hour
or
two
to
arrange
matters
for
your
departure
your
liberty
extends
to
the
next
room
lady
parlour
where
you
will
find
her
when
you
are
disposed
for
music
reading
or
conversation
we
have
taken
measures
to
exclude
all
servants
but
spontoon
who
is
as
true
as
steel
in
about
two
hours
colonel
talbot
returned
and
found
his
young
friend
conversing
with
his
lady
she
pleased
with
his
manners
and
information
and
he
delighted
at
being
restored
though
but
for
a
moment
to
the
society
of
his
own
rank
from
which
he
had
been
for
some
time
excluded
now
said
the
colonel
my
arrangements
for
there
is
little
time
to
lose
this
youngster
edward
waverley
alias
williams
alias
captain
butler
must
continue
to
pass
by
his
fourth
alias
of
francis
stanley
my
nephew
he
shall
set
out
morrow
for
the
north
and
the
chariot
shall
take
him
the
first
two
stages
spontoon
shall
then
attend
him
and
they
shall
ride
post
as
far
as
huntingdon
and
the
presence
of
spontoon
well
known
on
the
road
as
my
servant
will
check
all
disposition
to
inquiry
at
huntingdon
you
will
meet
the
real
frank
stanley
he
is
studying
at
cambridge
but
a
little
while
ago
doubtful
if
emily
health
would
permit
me
to
go
down
to
the
north
myself
i
procured
him
a
passport
from
the
secretary
of
state
office
to
go
in
my
stead
as
he
went
chiefly
to
look
after
you
his
journey
is
now
unnecessary
he
knows
your
story
you
will
dine
together
at
huntingdon
and
perhaps
your
wise
heads
may
hit
upon
some
plan
for
removing
or
diminishing
the
danger
of
your
farther
progress
ward
and
now
taking
out
a
morocco
case
let
me
put
you
in
funds
for
the
campaign
am
ashamed
my
dear
colonel
said
colonel
talbot
should
command
my
purse
in
any
event
but
this
money
is
your
own
your
father
considering
the
chance
of
your
being
attainted
left
me
his
trustee
for
your
advantage
so
that
you
are
worth
above
besides
lodge
a
very
independent
person
i
promise
you
there
are
bills
here
for
any
larger
sum
you
may
have
or
credit
abroad
as
soon
as
your
motions
require
it
the
first
use
which
occurred
to
waverley
of
his
newly
acquired
wealth
was
to
write
to
honest
farmer
jopson
requesting
his
acceptance
of
a
silver
tankard
on
the
part
of
his
friend
williams
who
had
not
forgotten
the
night
of
the
eighteenth
december
last
he
begged
him
at
the
same
time
carefully
to
preserve
for
him
his
highland
garb
and
accoutrements
particularly
the
arms
curious
in
themselves
and
to
which
the
friendship
of
the
donors
gave
additional
value
lady
emily
undertook
to
find
some
suitable
token
of
remembrance
likely
to
flatter
the
vanity
and
please
the
taste
of
williams
and
the
colonel
who
was
a
kind
of
farmer
promised
to
send
the
ullswater
patriarch
an
excellent
team
of
horses
for
cart
and
plough
one
happy
day
waverley
spent
in
london
and
travelling
in
the
manner
projected
he
met
with
frank
stanley
at
huntingdon
the
two
young
men
were
acquainted
in
a
minute
can
read
my
uncle
riddle
said
stanley
cautious
old
soldier
did
not
care
to
hint
to
me
that
i
might
hand
over
to
you
this
passport
which
i
have
no
occasion
for
but
if
it
should
afterwards
come
out
as
the
trick
of
a
young
cantab
cela
ne
tire
a
rien
you
are
therefore
to
be
francis
stanley
with
this
passport
this
proposal
appeared
in
effect
to
alleviate
a
great
part
of
the
difficulties
which
edward
must
otherwise
have
encountered
at
every
turn
and
accordingly
he
scrupled
not
to
avail
himself
of
it
the
more
especially
as
he
had
discarded
all
political
purposes
from
his
present
journey
and
could
not
be
accused
of
furthering
machinations
against
the
government
while
travelling
under
protection
of
the
secretary
passport
the
day
passed
merrily
away
the
young
student
was
inquisitive
about
waverley
campaigns
and
the
manners
of
the
highlands
and
edward
was
obliged
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
by
whistling
a
pibroch
dancing
a
strathspey
and
singing
a
highland
song
the
next
morning
stanley
rode
a
stage
northward
with
his
new
friend
and
parted
from
him
with
great
reluctance
upon
the
remonstrances
of
spontoon
who
accustomed
to
submit
to
discipline
was
rigid
in
enforcing
it
chapter
lxiii
desolation
waverley
riding
post
as
was
the
usual
fashion
of
the
period
without
any
adventure
save
one
or
two
queries
which
the
talisman
of
his
passport
sufficiently
answered
reached
the
borders
of
scotland
here
he
heard
the
tidings
of
the
decisive
battle
of
culloden
it
was
no
more
than
he
had
long
expected
though
the
success
at
falkirk
had
thrown
a
faint
and
setting
gleam
over
the
arms
of
the
chevalier
yet
it
came
upon
him
like
a
shock
by
which
he
was
for
a
time
altogether
unmanned
the
generous
the
courteous
the
adventurer
was
then
a
fugitive
with
a
price
upon
his
head
his
adherents
so
brave
so
enthusiastic
so
faithful
were
dead
imprisoned
or
exiled
where
now
was
the
exalted
and
fergus
if
indeed
he
had
survived
the
night
at
clifton
where
the
and
primitive
baron
of
bradwardine
whose
foibles
seemed
foils
to
set
off
the
disinterestedness
of
his
disposition
the
genuine
goodness
of
his
heart
and
his
unshaken
courage
those
who
clung
for
support
to
these
fallen
columns
rose
and
flora
where
were
they
to
be
sought
and
in
what
distress
must
not
the
loss
of
their
natural
protectors
have
involved
them
of
flora
he
thought
with
the
regard
of
a
brother
for
a
sister
of
rose
with
a
sensation
yet
more
deep
and
tender
it
might
be
still
his
fate
to
supply
the
want
of
those
guardians
they
had
lost
agitated
by
these
thoughts
he
precipitated
his
journey
when
he
arrived
in
edinburgh
where
his
inquiries
must
necessarily
commence
he
felt
the
full
difficulty
of
his
situation
many
inhabitants
of
that
city
had
seen
and
known
him
as
edward
waverley
how
then
could
he
avail
himself
of
a
passport
as
francis
stanley
he
resolved
therefore
to
avoid
all
company
and
to
move
northward
as
soon
as
possible
he
was
however
obliged
to
wait
a
day
or
two
in
expectation
of
a
letter
from
colonel
talbot
and
he
was
also
to
leave
his
own
address
under
his
feigned
character
at
a
place
agreed
upon
with
this
latter
purpose
he
sallied
out
in
the
dusk
through
the
streets
carefully
shunning
observation
but
in
vain
one
of
the
first
persons
whom
he
met
at
once
recognised
him
it
was
flockhart
fergus
ivor
landlady
guide
us
waverley
is
this
you
na
ye
needna
be
feared
for

merry
colonel
macivor
and
you
used
to
be
in
our
house
and
the
natured
widow
shed
a
few
natural
tears
as
there
was
no
resisting
her
claim
of
acquaintance
waverley
acknowledged
it
with
a
good
grace
as
well
as
the
danger
of
his
own
situation
it
near
the
darkening
sir
wad
ye
just
step
in
by
to
our
house
and
tak
a

instead
o
them
waverley
accepted
her
invitation
and
engaged
her
lodging
for
a
night
or
two
satisfied
he
should
be
safer
in
the
house
of
this
simple
creature
than
anywhere
else
when
he
entered
the
parlour
his
heart
swelled
to
see
fergus
bonnet
with
the
white
cockade
hanging
beside
the
little
mirror
said
flockhart
sighing
as
she
observed
the
direction
of
his
eyes

kens
that
but
they
say
he
fought
very
hard
in
that
bluidy
battle
at
inverness
and
deacon
clank
the
smith
says
that
the
government
folk
are
sair
agane
him
for
having
been
out
twice
and
troth
he
might
hae
warning
but
there
nae
me
like
an
auld
fule
the
puir
colonel
was
only
out
ance
such
conversation
contained
almost
all
the
widow
knew
of
the
fate
of
her
late
lodgers
and
acquaintances
but
it
was
enough
to
determine
edward
at
all
hazards
to
proceed
instantly
to
where
he
concluded
he
should
see
or
at
least
hear
something
of
rose
he
therefore
left
a
letter
for
colonel
talbot
at
the
place
agreed
upon
signed
by
his
assumed
name
and
giving
for
his
address
the
next
to
the
residence
from
edinburgh
to
perth
he
took
resolving
to
make
the
rest
of
his
journey
on
foot
a
mode
of
travelling
to
which
he
was
partial
and
which
had
the
advantage
of
permitting
a
deviation
from
the
road
when
he
saw
parties
of
military
at
a
distance
his
campaign
had
considerably
strengthened
his
constitution
and
improved
his
habits
of
enduring
fatigue
his
baggage
he
sent
before
him
as
opportunity
occurred
as
he
advanced
northward
the
traces
of
war
became
visible
broken
carriages
dead
horses
unroofed
cottages
trees
felled
for
palisades
and
bridges
destroyed
or
only
partially
repaired
all
indicated
the
movements
of
hostile
armies
in
those
places
where
the
gentry
were
attached
to
the
stuart
cause
their
houses
seemed
dismantled
or
deserted
the
usual
course
of
what
may
be
called
ornamental
labour
was
totally
interrupted
and
the
inhabitants
were
seen
gliding
about
with
fear
sorrow
and
dejection
on
their
faces
it
was
evening
when
he
approached
the
village
of
with
feelings
and
sentiments
how
different
from
those
which
attended
his
first
entrance
then
life
was
so
new
to
him
that
a
dull
or
disagreeable
day
was
one
of
the
greatest
misfortunes
which
his
imagination
anticipated
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
time
ought
only
to
be
consecrated
to
elegant
or
amusing
study
and
relieved
by
social
or
youthful
frolic
now
how
changed
how
saddened
yet
how
elevated
was
his
character
within
the
course
of
a
very
few
months
danger
and
misfortune
are
rapid
though
severe
teachers
sadder
and
a
wiser
man
he
felt
in
internal
confidence
and
mental
dignity
a
compensation
for
the
gay
dreams
which
in
his
case
experience
had
so
rapidly
dissolved
as
he
approached
the
village
he
saw
with
surprise
and
anxiety
that
a
party
of
soldiers
were
quartered
near
it
and
what
was
worse
that
they
seemed
stationary
there
this
he
conjectured
from
a
few
tents
which
he
beheld
glimmering
upon
what
was
called
the
common
moor
to
avoid
the
risk
of
being
stopped
and
questioned
in
a
place
where
he
was
so
likely
to
be
recognised
he
made
a
large
circuit
altogether
avoiding
the
hamlet
and
approaching
the
upper
gate
of
the
avenue
by
a
well
known
to
him
a
single
glance
announced
that
great
changes
had
taken
place
one
half
of
the
gate
entirely
destroyed
and
split
up
for
firewood
lay
in
piles
ready
to
be
taken
away
the
other
swung
uselessly
about
upon
its
loosened
hinges
the
battlements
above
the
gate
were
broken
and
thrown
down
and
the
carved
bears
which
were
said
to
have
done
sentinel
duty
upon
the
top
for
centuries
now
hurled
from
their
posts
lay
among
the
rubbish
the
avenue
was
cruelly
wasted
several
large
trees
were
felled
and
left
lying
across
the
path
and
the
cattle
of
the
villagers
and
the
more
rude
hoofs
of
dragoon
horses
had
poached
into
black
mud
the
verdant
turf
which
waverley
had
so
much
admired
upon
entering
the
edward
saw
the
fears
realised
which
these
circumstances
had
excited
the
place
had
been
sacked
by
the
king
troops
who
in
wanton
mischief
had
even
attempted
to
burn
it
and
though
the
thickness
of
the
walls
had
resisted
the
fire
unless
to
a
partial
extent
the
stables
and
were
totally
consumed
the
towers
and
pinnacles
of
the
main
building
were
scorched
and
blackened
the
pavement
of
the
court
broken
and
shattered
the
doors
torn
down
entirely
or
hanging
by
a
single
hinge
the
windows
dashed
in
and
demolished
and
the
court
strewed
with
articles
of
furniture
broken
into
fragments
the
accessaries
of
ancient
distinction
to
which
the
baron
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
had
attached
so
much
importance
and
veneration
were
treated
with
peculiar
contumely
the
fountain
was
demolished
and
the
spring
which
had
supplied
it
now
flooded
the
the
stone
basin
seemed
to
be
destined
for
a
for
cattle
from
the
manner
in
which
it
was
arranged
upon
the
ground
the
whole
tribe
of
bears
large
and
small
had
experienced
as
little
favour
as
those
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
and
one
or
two
of
the
family
pictures
which
seemed
to
have
served
as
targets
for
the
soldiers
lay
on
the
ground
in
tatters
with
an
aching
heart
as
may
well
be
imagined
edward
viewed
this
wreck
of
a
mansion
so
respected
but
his
anxiety
to
learn
the
fate
of
the
proprietors
and
his
fears
as
to
what
that
fate
might
be
increased
with
every
step
when
he
entered
upon
the
terrace
new
scenes
of
desolation
were
visible
the
balustrade
was
broken
down
the
walls
destroyed
the
borders
overgrown
with
weeds
and
the
cut
down
or
grubbed
up
in
one
compartment
of
this
garden
were
two
immense
trees
of
whose
size
the
baron
was
particularly
vain
too
lazy
perhaps
to
cut
them
down
the
spoilers
with
malevolent
ingenuity
had
mined
them
and
placed
a
quantity
of
gunpowder
in
the
cavity
one
had
been
shivered
to
pieces
by
the
explosion
and
the
fragments
lay
scattered
around
encumbering
the
ground
it
had
so
long
shadowed
the
other
mine
had
been
more
partial
in
its
effect
about
of
the
trunk
of
the
tree
was
torn
from
the
mass
which
mutilated
and
defaced
on
the
one
side
still
spread
on
the
other
its
ample
and
undiminished
boughs
footnote
a
pair
of

of
macdonald
of
glengarry
amid
these
general
marks
of
ravage
there
were
some
which
more
particularly
addressed
the
feelings
of
waverley
viewing
the
front
of
the
building
thus
wasted
and
defaced
his
eyes
naturally
sought
the
little
balcony
which
more
properly
belonged

her
troisieme

rather
cinquieme

was
easily
discovered

beneath

lay
the
and

it
was
her
pride
to
decorate
it
and
which
had
been
hurled
from
the
bartizan
several
of
her
books
were
mingled
with
broken
and
other
remnants
among
these
waverley
distinguished
one
of
his
own
a
small
copy
of
ariosto
and
gathered
it
as
a
treasure
though
wasted
by
the
wind
and
rain
while
plunged
in
the
sad
reflections
which
the
scene
excited
he
was
looking
around
for
some
one
who
might
explain
the
fate
of
the
inhabitants
he
heard
a
voice
from
the
interior
of
the
building
singing
in
accents
an
old
scottish
song
they
came
upon
us
in
the
night
and
brake
my
bower
and
slew
my
knight
my
servants
a
for
life
did
flee
and
left
us
in
extremitie
they
slew
my
knight
to
me
sae
dear
they
slew
my
knight
and
drave
his
gear
the
moon
may
set
the
sun
may
rise
but
a
deadly
sleep
has
closed
his
eyes

it
thou
poor

alone

and

the
poor
simpleton
showed
himself
from
among
the
ruins
of
a
sort
of
greenhouse
that
once
terminated
what
was
called
the
walk
but
at
first
sight
of
a
stranger
retreated
as
if
in
terror
waverley
remembering
his
habits
began
to
whistle
a
tune
to
which
he
was
partial
which
davie
had
expressed
great
pleasure
in
listening
to
and
had
picked
up
from
him
by
the
ear
our
minstrelsy
no
more
equalled
that
of
blondel
than
poor
davie
resembled
coeur
de
lion
but
the
melody
had
the
same
effect
of
producing
recognition
davie
again
stole
from
his
but
timidly
while
waverley
afraid
of
frightening
him
stood
making
the
most
encouraging
signals
he
could
devise
his
ghaist
muttered
davie
yet
coming
nearer
he
seemed
to
acknowledge
his
living
acquaintance
the
poor
fool
himself
appeared
the
ghost
of
what
he
had
been
the
peculiar
dress
in
which
he
had
been
attired
in
better
days
showed
only
miserable
rags
of
its
whimsical
finery
the
lack
of
which
was
oddly
supplied
by
the
remnants
of
tapestried
hangings
and
shreds
of
pictures
with
which
he
had
bedizened
his
tatters
his
face
too
had
lost
its
vacant
and
careless
air
and
the
poor
creature
looked
meagre
and
nervous
to
a
pitiable
degree
after
long
hesitation
he
at
length
approached
waverley
with
some
confidence
stared
him
sadly
in
the
face
and
said
dead
and
gane
a
dead
and
gane

dead

the
incapacity
of

to
hold
any

with
these
words
chanted
in
a
wild
and
earnest
tone
he
made
a
sign
to
waverley
to
follow
him
and
walked
rapidly
towards
the
bottom
of
the
garden
tracing
the
bank
of
the
stream
which
it
may
be
remembered
was
its
eastern
boundary
edward
over
whom
an
involuntary
shuddering
stole
at
the
import
of
his
words
followed
him
in
some
hope
of
an
explanation
as
the
house
was
evidently
deserted
he
could
not
expect
to
find
among
the
ruins
any
more
rational
informer
davie
walking
very
fast
soon
reached
the
extremity
of
the
garden
and
scrambled
over
the
ruins
of
the
wall
that
once
had
divided
it
from
the
wooded
glen
in
which
the
old
tower
of
veolan
was
situated
he
then
jumped
down
into
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
followed
by
waverley
proceeded
at
a
great
pace
climbing
over
some
fragments
of
rock
and
turning
with
difficulty
round
others
they
passed
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
castle
waverley
followed
keeping
up
with
his
guide
with
difficulty
for
the
twilight
began
to
fall
following
the
descent
of
the
stream
a
little
lower
he
totally
lost
him
but
a
twinkling
light
which
he
now
discovered
among
the
tangled
and
bushes
seemed
a
surer
guide
he
soon
pursued
a
very
uncouth
path
and
by
its
guidance
at
length
reached
the
door
of
a
wretched
hut
a
fierce
barking
of
dogs
was
at
first
heard
but
it
stilled
at
his
approach
a
voice
sounded
from
within
and
he
held
it
most
prudent
to
listen
before
he
advanced
hast
thou
brought
here
thou
unsonsy
villain
thou
said
an
old
woman
apparently
in
great
indignation
he
heard
davie
gellatley
in
answer
whistle
a
part
of
the
tune
by
which
he
had
recalled
himself
to
the
simpleton
memory
and
had
now
no
hesitation
to
knock
at
the
door
there
was
a
dead
silence
instantly
within
except
the
deep
growling
of
the
dogs
and
he
next
heard
the
mistress
of
the
hut
approach
the
door
not
probably
for
the
sake
of
undoing
a
latch
but
of
fastening
a
bolt
to
prevent
this
waverley
lifted
the
latch
himself
in
front
was
an
old
woman
exclaiming
comes
into
folk
houses
in
this
gate
at
this
time
o
the
night
on
one
side
two
grim
and
deer
greyhounds
laid
aside
their
ferocity
at
his
appearance
and
seemed
to
recognise
him
on
the
other
side
half
concealed
by
the
open
door
yet
apparently
seeking
that
concealment
reluctantly
with
a
cocked
pistol
in
his
right
hand
and
his
left
in
the
act
of
drawing
another
from
his
belt
stood
a
tall
bony
gaunt
figure
in
the
remnants
of
a
faded
uniform
and
a
beard
of
three
weeks
growth
it
was
the
baron
of
bradwardine
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
he
threw
aside
his
weapon
and
greeted
waverley
with
a
hearty
embrace

thearon
story
was
short
when
divested
of
the
adages
and
commonplaces
latin
english
and
scotch
with
which
his
erudition
garnished
it
he
insisted
much
upon
his
grief
at
the
loss
of
edward
and
of
glennaquoich
fought
the
fields
of
falkirk
and
culloden
and
related
how
after
all
was
lost
in
the
last
battle
he
had
returned
home
under
the
idea
of
more
easily
finding
shelter
among
his
own
tenants
and
on
his
own
estate
than
elsewhere
a
party
of
soldiers
had
been
sent
to
lay
waste
his
property
for
clemency
was
not
the
order
of
the
day
their
proceedings
however
were
checked
by
an
order
from
the
civil
court
the
estate
it
was
found
might
not
be
forfeited
to
the
crown
to
the
prejudice
of
malcolm
bradwardine
of
the
whose
claim
could
not
be
prejudiced
by
the
attainder
as
deriving
no
right
through
him
and
who
therefore
like
other
heirs
of
entail
in
the
same
situation
entered
upon
possession
but
unlike
many
in
similar
circumstances
the
new
laird
speedily
showed
that
he
intended
utterly
to
exclude
his
predecessor
from
all
benefit
or
advantage
in
the
estate
and
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
avail
himself
of
the
old
baron
evil
fortune
to
the
full
extent
this
was
the
more
ungenerous
as
it
was
generally
known
that
from
a
romantic
idea
of
not
prejudicing
this
young
man
right
as
the
baron
had
refrained
from
settling
his
estate
on
his
daughter
this
selfish
injustice
was
resented
by
the
country
people
who
were
partial
to
their
old
master
and
irritated
against
his
successor
in
the
baron
own
words
matter
did
not
coincide
with
the
feelings
of
the
commons
of
bradwardine
waverley
and
the
tenants
were
slack
and
repugnant
in
payment
of
their
mails
and
duties
and
when
my
kinsman
came
to
the
village
wi
the
new
factor
james
howie
to
lift
the
rents
some
wanchancy
person
i
suspect
john
heatherblutter
the
auld
gamekeeper
that
was
out
wi
me
in
the
year
fifteen
fired
a
shot
at
him
in
the
gloaming
whereby
he
was
so
affrighted
that
i
may
say
with
tullius
in
catilinam
abiit
evasit

effugit
he
fled
sir
as
one
may
say
incontinent
to
stirling
and
now
he
hath
advertised
the
estate
for
sale
being
himself
the
last
substitute
in
the
entail
and
if
i
were
to
lament
about
sic
matters
this
would
grieve
me
mair
than
its
passing
from
my
immediate
possession
whilk
by
the
course
of
nature
must
have
happened
in
a
few
years
whereas
now
it
passes
from
the

that
should

it

waverley
at

found
an
opportunity
to

narrative
by
an
inquiry
after

the

he
not

wish

prince
at

of
our
acquaintance
may

off
said
the
baron
to
waverley
who
joined
him
in
cordial
hopes
for
the
safety
of
the
unfortunate
chevalier
they
then
began
to
talk
of
their
future
prospects
the
plan
was
very
simple
it
was
to
escape
to
france
where
by
the
interest
of
his
old
friends
he
hoped
to
get
some
military
employment
of
which
he
still
conceived
himself
capable
he
invited
waverley
to
go
with
him
a
proposal
in
which
he
acquiesced
providing
the
interest
of
colonel
talbot
should
fail
in
procuring
his
pardon
tacitly
he
hoped
the
baron
would
sanction
his
addresses
to
rose
and
give
him
a
right
to
assist
him
in
his
exile
but
he
forbore
to
speak
on
this
subject
until
his
own
fate
should
be
decided
they
then
talked
of
glennaquoich
for
whom
the
baron
expressed
great
anxiety
although
he
observed
he
was
very
achilles
of
horatius
flaccus
impiger
iracundus
inexorabilis

which
he

a

into
some
kind
of
kennel
behind
the

been
long
asleep
and
snoring
between
ban
and
buscar
these
dogs
had
followed
him
to
the
hut
after
the
was
deserted
and
there
constantly
resided
and
their
ferocity
with
the
old
woman
reputation
of
being
a
witch
contributed
a
good
deal
to
keep
visitors
from

with

for

and
also
with
little
articles
of
luxury
for
his
patron
use
in
supplying
which
much
precaution
was
necessarily
used
after
some
compliments
the
baron
occupied
his
usual
couch
and
waverley
reclined
in
an
easy
chair
of
tattered
velvet
which
had
once
garnished
the
state
of
for
the
furniture
of
this
mansion
was
now
scattered
through
all
the
cottages
in
the
vicinity
and
went
to
sleep
as
comfortably
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
bed
of
down
chapter
lxv
more
explanation
with
the
first
dawn
of
day
old
janet
was
scuttling
about
the
house
to
wake
the
baron
who
usually
slept
sound
and
heavily
must
go
back
he
said
to
waverley
my
cove
will
you
walk
down
the
glen
wi
me
they
went
out
together
and
followed
a
narrow
and
entangled
which
the
occasional
passage
of
anglers
or
had
traced
by
the
side
of
the
stream
on
their
way
the
baron
explained
to
waverley
that
he
would
be
under
no
danger
in
remaining
a
day
or
two
at
and
even
in
being
seen
walking
about
if
he
used
the
precaution
of
pretending
that
he
was
looking
at
the
estate
as
agent
or
surveyor
for
an
english
gentleman
who
designed
to
be
purchaser
with
this
view
he
recommended
to
him
to
visit
the
bailie
who
still
lived
at
the
factor
house
called
little
veolan
about
a
mile
from
the
village
though
he
was
to
remove
at
next
term
stanley
passport
would
be
an
answer
to
the
officer
who
commanded
the
military
and
as
to
any
of
the
country
people
who
might
recognise
waverley
the
baron
assured
him
he
was
in
no
danger
of
being
betrayed
by
them
believe
said
the
old
man
the
people
of
the
barony
know
that
their
poor
auld
laird
is
somewhere
hereabout
for
i
see
they
do
not
suffer
a
single
bairn
to
come
here
a
a
practice
whilk
when
i
was
in
full
possession
of
my
power
as
baron
i
was
unable
totally
to
inhibit
nay
i
often
find
bits
of
things
in
my
way
that
the
poor
bodies
god
help
them
leave
there
because
they
think
they
may
be
useful
to
me
i
hope
they
will
get
a
wiser
master
and
as
kind
a
one
as
i
was
a
natural
sigh
closed
the
sentence
but
the
quiet
equanimity
with
which
the
baron
endured
his
misfortunes
had
something
in
it
venerable
and
even
sublime
there
was
no
fruitless
repining
no
turbid
melancholy
he
bore
his
lot
and
the
hardships
which
it
involved
with
a
though
serious
composure
and
used
no
violent
language
against
the
prevailing
party
did
what
i
thought
my
duty
said
the
good
old
man
questionless
they
are
doing
what
they
think
theirs
it
grieves
me
sometimes
to
look
upon
these
blackened
walls
of
the
house
of
my
ancestors
but
doubtless
officers
can
not
always
keep
the
hand
from
depredation
and
spuilzie
and
gustavus
adolphus
himself
as
ye
may
read
in
colonel
munro
his
expedition
with
the
worthy
scotch
regiment
called
mackay
regiment
did
often
permit
it
indeed
i
have
myself
seen
as
sad
sights
as
now
is
when
i
served
with
the
marechal
duke
of
berwick
to
be
sure
we
may
say
with
virgilius
maro
fuimus
troes
and
there
the
end
of
an
auld
sang
but
houses
and
families
and
men
have
a
stood
lang
eneugh
when
they
have
stood
till
they
fall
with
honour
and
now
i
hae
gotten
a
house
that
is
not
unlike
a
domus
ultima
they
were
now
standing
below
a
steep
rock
poor
jacobites
continued
the
baron
looking
up
now
like
the
conies
in
holy
scripture
which
the
great
traveller
pococke
calleth
jerboa
a
feeble
people
that
make
our
abode
in
the
rocks
so
fare
you
well
my
good
lad
till
we
meet
at
janet
in
the
even
for
i
must
get
into
my
patmos
which
is
no
easy
matter
for
my
auld
stiff
limbs
with
that
he
began
to
ascend
the
rock
striding
with
the
help
of
his
hands
from
one
precarious
footstep
to
another
till
he
got
about
up
where
two
or
three
bushes
concealed
the
mouth
of
a
hole
resembling
an
oven
into
which
the
baron
insinuated
first
his
head
and
shoulders
and
then
by
slow
gradation
the
rest
of
his
l
ong
body
his
legs
and
feet
finally
disappearing
coiled
up
like
a
huge
snake
entering
his
retreat
or
a
long
pedigree
introduced
with
care
and
difficulty
into
the
narrow
of
an
old
cabinet
waverley
had
the
curiosity
to
clamber
up
and
look
in
upon
him
in
his
den
as
the
might
well
be
termed
upon
the
whole
he
looked
not
unlike
that
ingenious
puzzle
called
reel
in
a
bottle
the
marvel
of
children
and
of
some
grown
people
too
myself
for
one
who
can
neither
comprehend
the
mysteryhowit
has
got
in
or
how
it
is
to
be
taken
out
the
cave
was
very
narrow
too
low
in
the
roof
to
admit
of
his
standing
or
almost
of
his
sitting
up
though
he
made
some
awkward
attempts
at
the
latter
posture
his
sole
amusement
was
the
perusal
of
his
old
friend
titus
livius
varied
by
occasionally
scratching
latin
proverbs
and
texts
of
scripture
with
his
knife
on
the
roof
and
walls
of
his
fortalice
which
were
of
sandstone
as
the
cave
was
dry
and
filled
with
clean
straw
and
withered
fern
made
as
he
said
coiling
himself
up
with
an
air
of
snugness
and
comfort
which
contrasted
strangely
with
his
situation
when
the
wind
was
due
north
a
very
passable
gite
for
an
old
soldier
neither
as
he
observed
was
he
without
sentries
for
the
purpose
of
reconnoitring
davie
and
his
mother
were
constantly
on
the
watch
to
discover
and
avert
danger
and
it
was
singular
what
instances
of
address
seemed
dictated
by
the
instinctive
attachment
of
the
poor
simpleton
when
his
patron
safety
was
concerned
with
janet
edward
now
sought
an
interview
he
had
recognised
her
at
first
sight
as
the
old
woman
who
had
nursed
him
during
his
sickness
after
his
delivery
from
gifted
gilfillan
the
hut
also
although
a
little
repaired
and
somewhat
better
furnished
was
certainly
the
place
of
his
confinement
and
he
now
recollected
on
the
common
moor
of
the
trunk
of
a
large
decayed
tree
called
the
try
which
he
had
no
doubt
was
the
same
at
which
the
highlanders
rendezvoused
on
that
memorable
night
all
this
he
had
combined
in
his
imagination
the
night
before
but
reasons
which
may
probably
occur
to
the
reader
prevented
him
from
catechising
janet
in
the
presence
of
the
baron
he
now
commenced
the
task
in
good
earnest
and
the
first
question
was
who
was
the
young
lady
that
visited
the
hut
during
his
illness
janet
paused
for
a
little
and
then
observed
that
to
keep
the
secret
now
would
neither
do
good
nor
ill
to
it
was
just
a
leddy
that
hasna
her
equal
in
the
world
miss
rose
bradwardine
miss
rose
was
probably
also
the
author
of
my
deliverance
inferred
waverley
delighted
at
the
confirmation
of
an
idea
which
local
circumstances
had
already
induced
him
to
entertain
wot
weel
wauverley
and
that
was
she
but
sair
sair
angry
and
affronted
wad
she
hae
been
puir
thing
if
she
had
thought
ye
had
been
ever
to
ken
a
word
about
the
matter
for
she
gar
me
speak
aye
gaelic
when
ye
was
in
hearing
to
mak
ye
trow
we
were
in
the
hielands
i
can
speak
it
weil
eneugh
for
my
mother
was
a
hieland
woman
a
few
more
questions
now
brought
out
the
whole
mystery
respecting
waverley
deliverance
from
the
bondage
in
which
he
left
cairnvreckan
never
did
music
sound
sweeter
to
an
amateur
than
the
drowsy
tautology
with
which
old
janet
detailed
every
circumstance
thrilled
upon
the
ears
of
waverley
but
my
reader
is
not
a
lover
and
i
must
spare
his
patience
by
attempting
to
condense
within
reasonable
compass
the
narrative
which
old
janet
spread
through
a
harangue
of
nearly
two
hours
when
waverley
communicated
to
fergus
the
letter
he
had
received
from
rose
bradwardine
by
davie
gellatley
giving
an
account
of
being
occupied
by
a
small
party
of
soldiers
that
circumstance
had
struck
upon
the
busy
and
active
mind
of
the
chieftain
eager
to
distress
and
narrow
the
posts
of
the
enemy
desirous
to
prevent
their
establishing
a
garrison
so
near
him
and
willing
also
to
oblige
the
baron
for
he
often
had
the
idea
of
marriage
with
rose
floating
through
his
brain
he
resolved
to
send
some
of
his
people
to
drive
out
the
and
to
bring
rose
to
glennaquoich
but
just
as
he
had
ordered
evan
with
a
small
party
on
this
duty
the
news
of
cope
having
marched
into
the
highlands
to
meet
and
disperse
the
forces
of
the
chevalier
ere
they
came
to
a
head
obliged
him
to
join
the
standard
with
his
whole
forces
he
sent
to
order
donald
bean
to
attend
him
but
that
cautious
freebooter
who
well
understood
the
value
of
a
separate
command
instead
of
joining
sent
various
apologies
which
the
pressure
of
the
times
compelled
fergus
to
admit
as
current
though
not
without
the
internal
resolution
of
being
revenged
on
him
for
his
procrastination
time
and
place
convenient
however
as
he
could
not
amend
the
matter
he
issued
orders
to
donald
to
descend
into
the
low
country
drive
the
soldiers
from
and
paying
all
respect
to
the
mansion
of
the
baron
to
take
his
abode
somewhere
near
it
for
protection
of
his
daughter
and
family
and
to
harass
and
drive
away
any
of
the
armed
volunteers
or
small
parties
of
military
which
he
might
find
moving
about
the
vicinity
as
this
charge
formed
a
sort
of
roving
commission
which
donald
proposed
to
interpret
in
the
way
most
advantageous
to
himself
as
he
was
relieved
from
the
immediate
terrors
of
fergus
and
as
he
had
from
former
secret
services
some
interest
in
the
councils
of
the
chevalier
he
resolved
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
he
achieved
without
difficulty
the
task
of
driving
the
soldiers
from
but
although
he
did
not
venture
to
encroach
upon
the
interior
of
the
family
or
to
disturb
miss
rose
being
unwilling
to
make
himself
a
powerful
enemy
in
the
army
for
well
he
knew
the
baron
wrath
was
deadly
yet
he
set
about
to
raise
contributions
and
exactions
upon
the
tenantry
and
otherwise
to
turn
the
war
to
his
own
advantage
meanwhile
he
mounted
the
white
cockade
and
waited
upon
rose
with
a
pretext
of
great
devotion
for
the
service
in
which
her
father
was
engaged
and
many
apologies
for
the
freedom
he
must
necessarily
use
for
the
support
of
his
people
it
was
at
this
moment
that
rose
learned
by
fame
with
all
sorts
of
exaggeration
that
waverley
had
killed
the
smith
at
cairnvreckan
in
an
attempt
to
arrest
him
had
been
cast
into
a
dungeon
by
major
melville
of
cairnvreckan
and
was
to
be
executed
by
martial
law
within
three
days
in
the
agony
which
these
tidings
excited
she
proposed
to
donald
bean
the
rescue
of
the
prisoner
it
was
the
very
sort
of
service
which
he
was
desirous
to
undertake
judging
it
might
constitute
a
merit
of
such
a
nature
as
would
make
amends
for
any
peccadilloes
which
he
might
be
guilty
of
in
the
country
he
had
the
art
however
pleading
all
the
while
duty
and
discipline
to
hold
off
until
poor
rose
in
the
extremity
of
her
distress
offered
to
bribe
him
to
the
enterprise
with
some
valuable
jewels
which
had
been
her
mother
donald
bean
who
had
served
in
france
knew
and
perhaps
estimated
the
value
of
these
trinkets
but
he
also
perceived
rose
apprehensions
of
its
being
discovered
that
she
had
parted
with
her
jewels
for
waverley
liberation
resolved
this
scruple
should
not
part
him
and
the
treasure
he
voluntarily
offered
to
take
an
oath
that
he
would
never
mention
miss
rose
share
in
the
transaction
and
foreseeing
convenience
in
keeping
the
oath
and
no
probable
advantage
in
breaking
it
he
took
the
engagement
in
order
as
he
told
his
lieutenant
to
deal
handsomely
by
the
young
lady
in
the
only
mode
and
form
which
by
a
mental
paction
with
himself
he
considered
as
binding
he
swore
secrecy
upon
his
drawn
dirk
he
was
the
more
especially
moved
to
this
act
of
good
faith
by
some
attentions
that
miss
bradwardine
showed
to
his
daughter
alice
which
while
they
gained
the
heart
of
the
mountain
damsel
highly
gratified
the
pride
of
her
father
alice
who
could
now
speak
a
little
english
was
very
communicative
in
return
for
rose
kindness
readily
confided
to
her
the
whole
papers
respecting
the
intrigue
with
gardiner
regiment
of
which
she
was
the
depositary
and
as
readily
undertook
at
her
instance
to
restore
them
to
waverley
without
her
father
knowledge
for
may
oblige
the
bonnie
young
lady
and
the
handsome
young
gentleman
said
alice
what
use
has
my
father
for
a
whin
bits
o
scarted
paper
the
reader
is
aware
that
she
took
an
opportunity
of
executing
this
purpose
on
the
eve
of
waverley
leaving
the
glen
how
donald
executed
his
enterprise
the
reader
is
aware
but
the
expulsion
of
the
military
from
had
given
alarm
and
while
he
was
lying
in
wait
for
gilfillan
a
strong
party
such
as
donald
did
not
care
to
face
was
sent
to
drive
back
the
insurgents
in
their
turn
to
encamp
there
and
to
protect
the
country
the
officer
a
gentleman
and
a
disciplinarian
neither
intruded
himself
on
miss
bradwardine
whose
unprotected
situation
he
respected
nor
permitted
his
soldiers
to
commit
any
breach
of
discipline
he
formed
a
little
camp
upon
an
eminence
near
the
house
of
and
placed
proper
guards
at
the
passes
in
the
vicinity
this
unwelcome
news
reached
donald
bean
lean
as
he
was
returning
to
determined
however
to
obtain
the
guerdon
of
his
labour
he
resolved
since
approach
to
was
impossible
to
deposit
his
prisoner
in
janet
cottage
a
place
the
very
existence
of
which
could
hardly
have
been
suspected
even
by
those
who
had
long
lived
in
the
vicinity
unless
they
had
been
guided
thither
and
which
was
utterly
unknown
to
waverley
himself
this
effected
he
claimed
and
received
his
reward
waverley
illness
was
an
event
which
deranged
all
their
calculations
donald
was
obliged
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
with
his
people
and
to
seek
more
free
course
for
his
adventures
elsewhere
at
rose
entreaty
he
left
an
old
man
a
herbalist
who
was
supposed
to
understand
a
little
of
medicine
to
attend
waverley
during
his
illness
in
the
meanwhile
new
and
fearful
doubts
started
in
rose
mind
they
were
suggested
by
old
janet
who
insisted
that
a
reward
having
been
offered
for
the
apprehension
of
waverley
and
his
own
personal
effects
being
so
valuable
there
was
no
saying
to
what
breach
of
faith
donald
might
be
tempted
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
terror
rose
took
the
daring
resolution
of
explaining
to
the
prince
himself
the
danger
in
which
waverley
stood
judging
that
both
as
a
politician
and
a
man
of
honour
and
humanity
charles
edward
would
interest
himself
to
prevent
his
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
opposite
party
this
letter
she
at
first
thought
of
sending
anonymously
but
naturally
feared
it
would
not
in
that
case
be
credited
she
therefore
subscribed
her
name
though
with
reluctance
and
terror
and
consigned
it
in
charge
to
a
young
man
who
at
leaving
his
farm
to
join
the
chevalier
army
made
it
his
petition
to
her
to
have
some
sort
of
credentials
to
the
adventurer
from
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
a
commission
the
letter
reached
charles
edward
on
his
descent
to
the
lowlands
and
aware
of
the
political
importance
of
having
it
supposed
that
he
was
in
correspondence
with
the
english
jacobites
he
caused
the
most
positive
orders
to
be
transmitted
to
donald
bean
lean
to
transmit
waverley
safe
and
uninjured
in
person
or
effects
to
the
governor
of
doune
castle
the
freebooter
durst
not
disobey
for
the
army
of
the
prince
was
now
so
near
him
that
punishment
might
have
followed
besides
he
was
a
politician
as
well
as
a
robber
and
was
unwilling
to
cancel
the
interest
created
through
former
secret
services
by
being
refractory
on
this
occasion
he
therefore
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
transmitted
orders
to
his
lieutenant
to
convey
edward
to
doune
which
was
safely
accomplished
in
the
mode
mentioned
in
a
former
chapter
the
governor
of
doune
was
directed
to
send
him
to
edinburgh
as
a
prisoner
because
the
prince
was
apprehensive
that
waverley
if
set
at
liberty
might
have
resumed
his
purpose
of
returning
to
england
without
affording
him
an
opportunity
of
a
personal
interview
in
this
indeed
he
acted
by
the
advice
of
the
chieftain
of
glennaquoich
with
whom
it
may
be
remembered
the
chevalier
communicated
upon
the
mode
of
disposing
of
edward
though
without
telling
him
how
he
came
to
learn
the
place
of
his
confinement
this
indeed
charles
edward
considered
as
a
lady
secret
for
although
rose
letter
was
couched
in
the
most
cautious
and
general
terms
and
professed
to
be
written
merely
from
motives
of
humanity
and
zeal
for
the
prince
service
yet
she
expressed
so
anxious
a
wish
that
she
should
not
be
known
to
have
interfered
that
the
chevalier
was
induced
to
suspect
the
deep
interest
which
she
took
in
waverley
safety
this
conjecture
which
was
well
founded
led
however
to
false
inferences
for
the
emotion
which
edward
displayed
on
approaching
flora
and
rose
at
the
ball
of
holyrood
was
placed
by
the
chevalier
to
the
account
of
the
latter
and
he
concluded
that
the
baron
views
about
the
settlement
of
his
property
or
some
such
obstacle
thwarted
their
mutual
inclinations
common
fame
it
is
true
frequently
gave
waverley
to
miss
but
the
prince
knew
that
common
fame
is
very
prodigal
in
such
gifts
and
watching
attentively
the
behaviour
of
the
ladies
towards
waverley
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
young
englishman
had
no
interest
with
flora
and
was
beloved
by
rose
bradwardine
desirous
to
bind
waverley
to
his
service
and
wishing
also
to
do
a
kind
and
friendly
action
the
prince
next
assailed
the
baron
on
the
subject
of
settling
his
estate
upon
his
daughter
bradwardine
acquiesced
but
the
consequence
was
that
fergus
was
immediately
induced
to
prefer
his
double
suit
for
a
wife
and
an
earldom
which
the
prince
rejected
in
the
manner
we
have
seen
the
chevalier
constantly
engaged
in
his
own
multiplied
affairs
had
not
hitherto
sought
any
explanation
with
waverley
though
often
meaning
to
do
so
but
after
fergus
declaration
he
saw
the
necessity
of
appearing
neutral
between
the
rivals
devoutly
hoping
that
the
matter
which
now
seemed
fraught
with
the
seeds
of
strife
might
be
permitted
to
lie
over
till
the
termination
of
the
expedition
when
on
the
march
to
derby
fergus
being
questioned
concerning
his
quarrel
with
waverley
alleged
as
the
cause
that
edward
was
desirous
of
retracting
the
suit
he
had
made
to
his
sister
the
chevalier
plainly
told
him
that
he
had
himself
observed
miss
behaviour
to
waverley
and
that
he
was
convinced
fergus
was
under
the
influence
of
a
mistake
in
judging
of
waverley
conduct
who
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
was
engaged
to
miss
bradwardine
the
quarrel
which
ensued
between
edward
and
the
chieftain
is
i
hope
still
in
the
remembrance
of
the
reader
these
circumstances
will
serve
to
explain
such
points
of
our
narrative
as
according
to
the
custom
of
we
deemed
it
fit
to
leave
unexplained
for
the
purpose
of
exciting
the
reader
curiosity
when
janet
had
once
finished
the
leading
facts
of
this
narrative
waverley
was
easily
enabled
to
apply
the
clue
which
they
afforded
to
other
mazes
of
the
labyrinth
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
to
rose
bradwardine
then
he
owed
the
life
which
he
now
thought
he
could
willingly
have
laid
down
to
serve
her
a
little
reflection
convinced
him
however
that
to
live
for
her
sake
was
more
convenient
and
agreeable
and
that
being
possessed
of
independence
she
might
share
it
with
him
either
in
foreign
countries
or
in
his
own
the
pleasure
of
being
allied
to
a
man
of
the
baron
high
worth
and
who
was
so
much
valued
by
his
uncle
sir
everard
was
also
an
agreeable
consideration
had
anything
been
wanting
to
recommend
the
match
his
absurdities
which
had
appeared
grotesquely
ludicrous
during
his
prosperity
seemed
in
the
sunset
of
his
fortune
to
be
harmonised
and
assimilated
with
the
noble
features
of
his
character
so
as
to
add
peculiarity
without
exciting
ridicule

mind

with
such
projects

happiness

omened
colour
might
remind
his
visitors
of
his
unlucky
excursion
to

to
sum
up
the
picture
his
face
was
daubed
with
snuff
up
to
the
eyes
and
his
fingers
with
ink
up
to
the
knuckles
he
looked
dubiously
at

as
he
approached
the
little
green
rail
which
fenced
his
desk
and
stool
from
the
approach
of

vulgar

could
give
the

more
annoyance
than
the
idea
of

claimed
by
any
of
the
unfortunate
gentlemen
who
were
now
so
much
more
likely
to
need
assistance
than
to
afford

this
was
the
rich
young

who
knew
what
might

his
situation

was

ridiculously

which
savoured

the
wily

listened
with

somewhat
comforted
by

that
he

with
glee

from

fell

lord
preserve

said
waverley
now
macwheeble
let
us
proceed
to
business
this
word
had
somewhat
a
sedative
effect
but
the
bailie
head
as
he
expressed
himself
was
still
the
bees
he
mended
his
pen
however
marked
half
a
dozen
sheets
of
paper
with
an
ample
marginal
fold
whipped
down
dallas
of
martin
from
a
shelf
where
that
venerable
work
roosted
with
stair
dirleton
balfour
and
a
parcel
of
old
opened
the
volume
at
the
article
contract
of
marriage
and
prepared
to
make
what
he
called
minute
to
prevent
parties
frae
resiling
with
some
difficulty
waverley
made
him
comprehend
that
he
was
going
a
little
too
fast
he
explained
to
him
that
he
should
want
his
assistance
in
the
first
place
to
make
his
residence
safe
for
the
time
by
writing
to
the
officer
at
that
stanley
an
english
gentleman
nearly
related
to
colonel
talbot
was
upon
a
visit
of
business
at
macwheeble
and
knowing
the
state
of
the
country
had
sent
his
passport
for
captain
inspection
this
produced
a
polite
answer
from
the
officer
with
an
invitation
to
stanley
to
dine
with
him
which
was
declined
as
may
easily
be
supposed
under
pretence
of
business
waverley
next
request
was
that
macwheeble
would
despatch
a
man
and
horse
to
the
at
which
colonel
talbot
was
to
address
him
with
directions
to
wait
there
until
the
post
should
bring
a
letter
for
stanley
and
then
to
forward
it
to
little
veolan
with
all

edward
inquired
if
he
had
heard
anything
lately
of
the
chieftain
of
glennaquoich
one
word
answered
macwheeble
that
he
was
still
in
carlisle
castle
and
was
soon
to
be
panelled
for
his
life
i
dinna

young

flung

a
into
yon
idle
quean
lap
at

but
light
come
light
gane
for
my
part
i
never
wish
to
see
a
kilt
in

country
again
nor
a
nor
a

for
that
matter
unless
it
were
to

what

hae
na
a
plack
to
pay
ye
ye
need
never
extract
it
with
such
discourse
and
the
intervening
topics
of
business
the
time
passed
until
dinner
macwheeble
meanwhile
promising
to
devise
some
mode
of
introducing
edward
at
the
duchran
where
rose
at
present
resided
without
risk
of
danger
or
suspicion
which
seemed
no
very
easy
task
since
the
laird
was
a
very
zealous
friend
to
government
the
had
been
laid
under
requisition
and
cockyleeky
and
scotch
collops
soon
reeked
in
the
bailie
little
parlour
the
landlord
was
just
introduced
into
the
muzzle
of
a
pint
bottle
of
claret
cribbed
possibly
from
the
cellars
of
when
the
sight
of
the
grey
pony
passing
the
window
at
full
trot
induced
the
bailie
but
with
due
precaution
to
place
it
aside
for
the
moment
enter
jock
scriever
with
a
packet
for
stanley
it
is
colonel
talbot
seal
and
edward
ringers
tremble
as
he
undoes
it
two
official
papers
folded
signed
and
sealed
in
all
formality
drop
out
they
were
hastily
picked
up
by
the
bailie
who
had
a
natural
respect
for
everything
resembling
a
deed
and
glancing
slily
on
their
titles
his
eyes
or
rather
spectacles
are
greeted
with
by
his
royal
highness
to
the
person
of
cosmo
comyne
bradwardine
of
that
ilk
commonly
called
baron
of
bradwardine
forfeited
for
his
accession
to
the
late
rebellion
the
other
proves
to
be
a
protection
of
the
same
tenor
in
favour
of
edward
waverley
esq
colonel
talbot
letter
was
in
these
words
dear
edward
am
just
arrived
here
and
yet
i
have
finished
my
business
it
has
cost
me
some
trouble
though
as
you
shall
hear
i
waited
upon
his
royal
highness
immediately
on
my
arrival
and
found
him
in
no
very
good
humour
for
my
purpose
three
or
four
scotch
gentlemen
were
just
leaving
his
levee
after
he
had
expressed
himself
to
me
very
courteously
would
you
think
it
he
said
talbot
here
have
been
half
a
dozen
of
the
most
respectable
gentlemen
and
best
friends
to
government
north
of
the
forth
major
melville
of
cairnvreckan
rubrick
of
duchran
and
others
who
have
fairly
wrung
from
me
by
their
downright
importunity
a
present
protection
and
the
promise
of
a
future
pardon
for
that
stubborn
old
rebel
whom
they
call
baron
of
bradwardine
they
allege
that
his
high
personal
character
and
the
clemency
which
he
showed
to
such
of
our
people
as
fell
into
the
rebels
hands
should
weigh
in
his
favour
especially
as
the
loss
of
his
estate
is
likely
to
be
a
severe
enough
punishment
rubrick
has
undertaken
to
keep
him
at
his
own
house
till
things
are
settled
in
the
country
but
it
a
little
hard
to
be
forced
in
a
manner
to
pardon
such
a
mortal
enemy
to
the
house
of
brunswick
this
was
no
favourable
moment
for
opening
my
business
however
i
said
i
was
rejoiced
to
learn
that
his
royal
highness
was
in
the
course
of
granting
such
requests
as
it
emboldened
me
to
present
one
of
the
like
nature
in
my
own
name
he
was
very
angry
but
i
persisted
i
mentioned
the
uniform
support
of
our
three
votes
in
the
house
touched
modestly
on
services
abroad
though
valuable
only
in
his
royal
having
been
pleased
kindly
to
accept
them
and
founded
pretty
strongly
on
his
own
expressions
of
friendship
and
he
was
embarrassed
but
obstinate
i
hinted
the
policy
of
detaching
on
all
future
occasions
the
heir
of
such
a
fortune
as
your
uncle
from
the
machinations
of
the
disaffected
but
i
made
no
impression
i
mentioned
the
obligations
which
i
lay
under
to
sir
everard
and
to
you
personally
and
claimed
as
the
sole
reward
of
my
services
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
afford
me
the
means
of
evincing
my
gratitude
i
perceived
that
he
still
meditated
a
refusal
and
taking
my
commission
from
my
pocket
i
said
as
a
last
resource
that
as
his
royal
highness
did
not
under
these
pressing
circumstances
think
me
worthy
of
a
favour
which
he
had
not
scrupled
to
grant
to
other
gentlemen
whose
services
i
could
hardly
judge
more
important
than
my
own
i
must
beg
leave
to
deposit
with
all
humility
my
commission
in
his
royal
hands
and
to
retire
from
the
service
he
was
not
prepared
for
this
he
told
me
to
take
up
my
commission
said
some
handsome
things
of
my
services
and
granted
my
request
you
are
therefore
once
more
a
free
man
and
i
have
promised
for
you
that
you
will
be
a
good
boy
in
future
and
remember
what
you
owe
to
the
lenity
of
government
thus
you
see
my
prince
can
be
as
generous
as
yours
i
do
not
pretend
indeed
that
he
confers
a
favour
with
all
the
foreign
graces
and
compliments
of
your
chevalier
errant
but
he
has
a
plain
english
manner
and
the
evident
reluctance
with
which
he
grants
your
request
indicates
the
sacrifice
which
he
makes
of
his
own
inclination
to
your
wishes
my
friend
the
general
has
procured
me
a
duplicate
of
the
baron
protection
the
original
being
in
major
melville
possession
which
i
send
to
you
as
i
know
that
if
you
can
find
him
you
will
have
pleasure
in
being
the
first
to
communicate
the
joyful
intelligence
he
will
of
course
repair
to
the
duchran
without
loss
of
time
there
to
ride
quarantine
for
a
few
weeks
as
for
you
i
give
you
leave
to
escort
him
thither
and
to
stay
a
week
there
as
i
understand
a
certain
fair
lady
is
in
that
quarter
and
i
have
the
pleasure
to
tell
you
that
whatever
progress
you
can
make
in
her
good
graces
will
be
highly
agreeable
to
sir
everard
and
rachel
who
will
never
believe
your
views
and
prospects
settled
and
the
three
ermines
passant
in
actual
safety
until
you
present
them
with
a
edward
waverley
now
certain
of
my
own
a
good
many
years
since
interrupted
some
measures
which
were
then
proposed
in
favour
of
the
three
ermines
passant
so
i
am
bound
in
honour
to
make
them
amends
therefore
make
good
use
of
your
time
for
when
your
week
is
expired
it
will
be
necessary
that
you
go
to
london
to
plead
your
pardon
in
the
law
courts
dear
waverley
yours
most
truly
talbot
chapter
lxvii
happy
the
wooing
that
not
long
a
doing
when
the
first
rapturous
sensation
occasioned
by
these
excellent
tidings
had
somewhat
subsided
edward
proposed
instantly
to
go
down
to
the
glen
to
acquaint
the
baron
with
their
import
but
the
cautious
bailie
justly
observed
that
if
the
baron
were
to
appear
instantly
in
public
the
tenantry
and
villagers
might
become
riotous
in
expressing
their
joy
and
give
offence
to
powers
that
be
a
sort
of
persons
for
whom
the
bailie
always
had
unlimited
respect
he
therefore
proposed
that
waverley
should
go
to
janet
gellatley
and
bring
the
baron
up
under
cloud
of
night
to
little
veolan
where
he
might
once
more
enjoy
the
luxury
of
a
good
bed
in
the
meanwhile
he
said
he
himself
would
go
to
captain
foster
and
show
him
the
baron
protection
and
obtain
his
countenance
for
harbouring
him
that
night
and
he
would
have
horses
ready
on
the
morrow
to
set
him
on
his
way
to
the
duchran
along
with
stanley
denomination
i
apprehend
your
honour
will
for
the
present
retain
said
the
bailie
macwheeble
but
will
you
not
go
down
to
the
glen
yourself
in
the
evening
to
meet
your
patron
i
wad
wi
a
my
heart
and
mickle
obliged
to
your
honour
for
putting
me
in
mind
o
mybounden
duty
but
it
will
be
past
sunset
afore
i
get
back
frae
the
captain
and
at
these
unsonsy
hours
the
glen
has
a
bad
name
there
something
no
that
canny
about
auld
janet
gellatley
the
laird
he
no
believe
thae
things
but
he
was
aye
ower
rash
and
venturesome
and
feared
neither
man
nor
deevil
an
sae
seen
but
right
sure
am
i
sir
george
mackenyie
says
that
no
divine
can
doubt
there
are
witches
since
the
bible
says
thou
shalt
not
suffer
them
to
live
and
that
no
lawyer
in
scotland
can
doubt
it
since
it
is
punishable
with
death
by
our
law
so
there
baith
law
and
gospel
for
it
an
his
honour
winna
believe
the
leviticus
he
might
aye
believe
the
book
but
he
may
tak
his
ain
way
it
a
ane
to
duncan
macwheeble
however
i
shall
send
to
ask
up
auld
janet
this
it
best
no
to
lightly
them
that
have
that
character
and
want
davie
to
turn
the
spit
for
i
gar
eppie
put
down
a
fat
goose
to
the
fire
for
your
honours
to
your
supper
when
it
was
near
sunset
waverley
hastened
to
the
hut
and
he
could
not
but
allow
that
superstition
had
chosen
no
improper
locality
or
unfit
object
for
the
foundation
of
her
fantastic
terrors
it
resembled
exactly
the
description
of
spenser
there
in
a
gloomy
hollow
glen
she
found
a
little
cottage
built
of
sticks
and
reeds
in
homely
wise
and
wall
with
sods
around
in
which
a
witch
did
dwell
in
loathly
weeds
and
wilful
want
all
careless
of
her
needs
so
choosing
solitary
to
abide
far
from
all
neighbours
that
her
devilish
deeds
and
hellish
arts
from
people
she
might
hide
and
hurt
far
off
unknown
whomsoever
she
espied
he
entered
the
cottage
with
these
verses
in
his
memory
poor
old
janet
bent
double
with
age
and
bleared
with
was
tottering
about
the
hut
with
a
birch
broom
muttering
to
herself
as
she
endeavoured
to
make
her
hearth
and
floor
a
little
clean
for
the
reception
of
her
expected
guests
waverley
step
made
her
start
look
up
and
fall
so
much
had
her
nerves
been
on
the
rack
for
her
patron
safety
with
difficulty
waverley
made
her
comprehend
that
the
baron
was
now
safe
from
personal
danger
and
when
her
mind
had
admitted
that
joyful
news
it
was
equally
hard
to
make
her
believe
that
he
was
not
to
enter
again
upon
possession
of
his
estate
behoved
to
be
she
said
wad
get
it
back
again
naebody
wad
be
sae
gripple
as
to
tak
his
gear
after
they
had
him
a
pardon
and
for
that
i
could
whiles
wish
mysell
a
witch
for
his
sake
if
i
werena
feared
the
enemy
wad
tak
me
at
my
word
waverley
then
gave
her
some
money
and
promised
that
her
fidelity
should
be
rewarded
can
i
be
rewarded
sir
sae
weel
as
just
to
see
my
auld
maister
and
miss
rose
come
back
and
bruik
their
ain
waverley
now
took
leave
of
janet
and
soon
stood
beneath
the
baron
patmos
at
a
low
whistle
he
observed
the
veteran
peeping
out
to
reconnoitre
like
an
old
badger
with
his
head
out
of
his
hole
hae
come
rather
early
my
good
lad
said
he
descending
question
if
the
hae
beat
the
tattoo
yet
and
we
not
safe
till
then
news
can
not
be
told
too
soon
said
waverley
and
with
infinite
joy
communicated
to
him
the
happy
tidings
the
old
man
stood
for
a
moment
in
silent
devotion
then
exclaimed
be
to
god
i
shall
see
my
bairn
again
never
i
hope
to
part
with
her
more
said
waverley
trust
in
god
not
unless
it
be
to
win
the
means
of
supporting
her
for
my
things
are
but
in
a
bruckle
state
but
what
signifies
warld
gear
if
said
waverley
modestly
were
a
situation
in
life
which
would
put
miss
bradwardine
beyond
the
uncertainty
of
fortune
and
in
the
rank
to
which
she
was
born
would
you
object
to
it
my
dear
baron
because
it
would
make
one
of
your
friends
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
the
baron
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
great
earnestness
continued
edward
shall
not
consider
my
sentence
of
banishment
as
repealed
unless
you
will
give
me
permission
to
accompany
you
to
the
duchran
and
the
baron
seemed
collecting
all
his
dignity
to
make
a
suitable
reply
to
what
at
another
time
he
would
have
treated
as
the
propounding
a
treaty
of
alliance
between
the
houses
of
bradwardine
and
waverley
but
his
efforts
were
in
vain
the
father
was
too
mighty
for
the
baron
the
pride
of
birth
and
rank
were
swept
away
in
the
joyful
surprise
a
slight
convulsion
passed
rapidly
over
his
features
as
he
gave
way
to
the
feelings
of
nature
threw
his
arms
around
waverley
neck
and
sobbed
out
son
my
son
if
i
had
been
to
search
the
world
i
would
have
made
my
choice
here
edward
returned
the
embrace
with
great
sympathy
of
feeling
and
for
a
little
while
they
both
kept
silence
at
length
it
was
broken
by
edward
miss
bradwardine
had
never
a
will
but
her
old
father
besides
you
are
a
likely
youth
of
honest
principles
and
high
birth
no
she
never
had
any
other
will
than
mine
and
in
my
proudest
days
i
could
not
have
wished
a
mair
eligible
espousal
for
her
than
the
nephew
of
my
excellent
old
friend
sir
everard
but
i
hope
young
man
ye
deal
na
rashly
in
this
matter
i
hope
ye
hae
secured
the
approbation
of
your
ain
friends
and
allies
particularly
of
your
uncle
who
is
in
loco
parentis
ah
we
maun
tak
heed
o
that
edward
assured
him
that
sir
everard
would
think
himself
highly
honoured
in
the
flattering
reception
his
proposal
had
met
with
and
that
it
had
his
entire
approbation
in
evidence
of
which
he
put
colonel
talbot
letter
into
the
baron
hand
the
baron
read
it
with
great
attention
everard
he
said
despised
wealth
in
comparison
of
honour
and
birth
and
indeed
he
hath
no
occasion
to
court
the
diva
pecunia
yet
i
now
wish
since
this
malcolm
turns
out
such
a
parricide
for
i
can
call
him
no
better
as
to
think
of
alienating
the
family
inheritance
i
now
wish
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
part
of
the
roof
which
was
visible
above
the
trees
that
i
could
have
left
rose
the
auld
and
the
riggs
belanging
to
it
and
yet
said
he
resuming
more
cheerfully
maybe
as
weel
as
it
is
for
as
baron
of
bradwardine
i
might
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
insist
upon
certain
compliances
respecting
name
and
bearings
whilk
now
as
a
landless
laird
wi
a
tocherless
daughter
no
one
can
blame
me
for
departing
from
heaven
be
praised
thought
edward
sir
everard
does
not
hear
these
scruples
the
three
ermines
passant
and
rampant
bear
would
certainly
have
gone
together
by
the
ears
he
then
with
all
the
ardour
of
a
young
lover
assured
the
baron
that
he
sought
for
his
happiness
only
in
rose
heart
and
hand
and
thought
himself
as
happy
in
her
father
simple
approbation
as
if
he
had
settled
an
earldom
upon
his
daughter
they
now
reached
little
veolan
the
goose
was
smoking
on
the
table
and
the
bailie
brandished
his
knife
and
fork
a
joyous
greeting
took
place
between
him
and
his
patron
the
kitchen
too
had
its
company
auld
janet
was
established
at
the
davie
had
turned
the
spit
to
his
immortal
honour
and
even
ban
and
buscar
in
the
liberality
of
macwheeble
joy
had
been
stuffed
to
the
throat
with
food
and
now
lay
snoring
on
the
floor
the
next
day
conducted
the
baron
and
his
young
friend
to
the
duchran
where
the
former
was
expected
in
consequence
of
the
success
of
the
nearly
unanimous
application
of
the
scottish
friends
of
government
in
his
favour
this
had
been
so
general
and
so
powerful
that
it
was
almost
thought
his
estate
might
have
been
saved
had
it
not
passed
into
the
rapacious
hands
of
his
unworthy
kinsman
whose
right
arising
out
of
the
baron
attainder
could
not
be
affected
by
a
pardon
from
the
crown
the
old
gentleman
however
said
with
his
usual
spirit
he
was
more
gratified
by
the
hold
he
possessed
in
the
good
opinion
of
his
neighbours
than
he
would
have
been
in
being
rehabilitated
and
restored
in
integrum
had
it
been
found
practicable
we
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
meeting
of
the
father
and
daughter
loving
each
other
so
affectionately
and
separated
under
such
perilous
circumstances
still
less
shall
we
attempt
to
analyse
the
deep
blush
of
rose
at
receiving
the
compliments
of
waverley
or
stop
to
inquire
whether
she
had
any
curiosity
respecting
the
particular
cause
of
his
journey
to
scotland
at
that
period
we
shall
not
even
trouble
the
reader
with
the
humdrum
details
of
a
courtship
sixty
years
since
it
is
enough
to
say
that
under
so
strict
a
martinet
as
the
baron
all
things
were
conducted
in
due
form
he
took
upon
himself
the
morning
after
their
arrival
the
task
of
announcing
the
proposal
of
waverley
to
rose
which
she
heard
with
a
proper
degree
of
maiden
timidity
fame
does
however
say
that
waverley
had
the
evening
before
found
five
minutes
to
apprise
her
of
what
was
coming
while
the
rest
of
the
company
were
looking
at
three
twisted
serpents
which
formed
a
jet
in
the
garden
my
fair
readers
will
judge
for
themselves
but
for
my
part
i
can
not
conceive
how
so
important
an
affair
could
be
communicated
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
at
least
it
certainly
took
a
full
hour
in
the
baron
mode
of
conveying
it
waverley
was
now
considered
as
a
received
lover
in
all
the
forms
he
was
made
by
dint
of
smirking
and
nodding
on
the
part
of
the
lady
of
the
house
to
sit
next
miss
bradwardine
at
dinner
to
be
miss
bradwardine
partner
at
cards
if
he
came
into
the
room
she
of
the
four
miss
rubricks
who
chanced
to
be
next
rose
was
sure
to
recollect
that
her
thimble
or
her
scissors
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
in
order
to
leave
the
seat
nearest
to
miss
bradwardine
vacant
for
his
occupation
and
sometimes
if
papa
and
mamma
were
not
in
the
way
to
keep
them
on
their
good
behaviour
the
misses
would
titter
a
little
the
old
laird
of
duchran
would
also
have
his
occasional
jest
and
the
old
lady
her
remark
even
the
baron
could
not
refrain
but
here
rose
escaped
every
embarrassment
but
that
of
conjecture
for
his
wit
was
usually
couched
in
a
latin
quotation
the
very
footmen
sometimes
grinned
too
broadly
the
maidservants
giggled
mayhap
too
loud
and
a
provoking
air
of
intelligence
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
family
alice
bean
the
pretty
maid
of
the
cavern
who
after
her
misfortune
as
she
called
it
had
attended
rose
as
chambre
smiled
and
smirked
with
the
best
of
them
rose
and
edward
however
endured
all
these
little
vexatious
circumstances
as
other
folks
have
done
before
and
since
and
probably
contrived
to
obtain
some
indemnification
since
they
are
not
supposed
on
the
whole
to
have
been
particularly
unhappy
during
waverley
six
days
stay
at
the
duchran
it
was
finally
arranged
that
edward
should
go
to
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
his
marriage
thence
to
london
to
take
the
proper
measures
for
pleading
his
pardon
and
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
claim
the
hand
of
his
plighted
bride
he
also
intended
in
his
journey
to
visit
colonel
talbot
but
above
all
it
was
his
most
important
object
to
learn
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
chief
of
glennaquoich
to
visit
him
at
carlisle
and
to
try
whether
anything
could
be
done
for
procuring
if
not
a
pardon
a
commutation
at
least
or
alleviation
of
the
punishment
to
which
he
was
almost
certain
of
being
condemned
and
in
case
of
the
worst
to
offer
the
miserable
flora
an
asylum
with
rose
or
otherwise
to
assist
her
views
in
any
mode
which
might
seem
possible
the
fate
of
fergus
seemed
hard
to
be
averted
edward
had
already
striven
to
interest
his
friend
colonel
talbot
in
his
behalf
but
had
been
given
distinctly
to
understand
by
his
reply
that
his
credit
in
matters
of
that
nature
was
totally
exhausted
the
colonel
was
still
in
edinburgh
and
proposed
to
wait
there
for
some
months
upon
business
confided
to
him
by
the
duke
of
cumberland
he
was
to
be
joined
by
lady
emily
to
whom
easy
travelling
and
goat
whey
were
recommended
and
who
was
to
journey
northward
under
the
escort
of
francis
stanley
edward
therefore
met
the
colonel
at
edinburgh
who
wished
him
joy
in
the
kindest
manner
on
his
approaching
happiness
and
cheerfully
undertook
many
commissions
which
our
hero
was
necessarily
obliged
to
delegate
to
his
charge
but
on
the
subject
of
fergus
he
was
inexorable
he
satisfied
edward
indeed
that
his
interference
would
be
unavailing
but
besides
colonel
talbot
owned
that
he
could
not
conscientiously
use
any
influence
in
favour
of
that
unfortunate
gentleman
he
said
demanded
some
penalty
of
those
who
had
wrapped
the
whole
nation
in
fear
and
in
mourning
could
not
perhaps
have
selected
a
fitter
victim
he
came
to
the
field
with
the
fullest
light
upon
the
nature
of
his
attempt
he
had
studied
and
understood
the
subject
his
fate
could
not
intimidate
him
the
lenity
of
the
laws
which
had
restored
to
him
his
father
property
and
rights
could
not
melt
him
that
he
was
brave
generous
and
possessed
many
good
qualities
only
rendered
him
the
more
dangerous
that
he
was
enlightened
and
accomplished
made
his
crime
the
less
excusable
that
he
was
an
enthusiast
in
a
wrong
cause
only
made
him
the
more
fit
to
be
its
martyr
above
all
he
had
been
the
means
of
bringing
many
hundreds
of
men
into
the
field
who
without
him
would
never
have
broken
the
peace
of
the
country
repeat
it
said
the
colonel
heaven
knows
with
a
heart
distressed
for
him
as
an
individual
that
this
young
gentleman
has
studied
and
fully
understood
the
desperate
game
which
he
has
played
he
threw
for
life
or
death
a
coronet
or
a
coffin
and
he
can
not
now
be
permitted
with
justice
to
the
country
to
draw
stakes
because
the
dice
have
gone
against
him
such
was
the
reasoning
of
those
times
held
even
by
brave
and
humane
men
towards
a
vanquished
enemy
let
us
devoutly
hope
that
in
this
respect
at
least
we
shall
never
see
the
scenes
or
hold
the
sentiments
that
were
general
in
britain
sixty
years
since
chapter
lxviii
to
morrow
o
that
sudden
spare
him

shakspeare
edward
attended
by
his
former
servant
alick
polwarth
who
had
reentered
his
service
at
edinburgh
reached
carlisle
while
the
commission
of
oyer
and
terminer
on
his
unfortunate
associates
was
yet
sitting
he
had
pushed
forward
in
haste
not
alas
with
the
most
distant
hope
of
saving
fergus
but
to
see
him
for
the
last
time
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
that
he
had
furnished
funds
for
the
defence
of
the
prisoners
in
the
most
liberal
manner
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
the
day
of
trial
was
fixed
a
solicitor
and
the
first
counsel
accordingly
attended
but
it
was
upon
the
same
footing
on
which
the
first
physicians
are
usually
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
some
dying
man
of
rank
the
doctors
to
take
the
advantage
of
some
incalculable
chance
of
an
exertion
of
nature
the
lawyers
to
avail
themselves
of
the
barely
possible
occurrence
of
some
legal
flaw
edward
pressed
into
the
court
which
was
extremely
crowded
but
by
his
arriving
from
the
north
and
his
extreme
eagerness
and
agitation
it
was
supposed
he
was
a
relation
of
the
prisoners
and
people
made
way
for
him
it
was
the
third
sitting
of
the
court
and
there
were
two
men
at
the
bar
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
already
pronounced
edward
just
glanced
at
the
bar
during
the
momentous
pause
which
ensued
there
was
no
mistaking
the
stately
form
and
noble
features
of
fergus
although
his
dress
was
squalid
and
his
countenance
tinged
with
the
sickly
yellow
hue
of
long
and
close
imprisonment
by
his
side
was
evan
maccombich
edward
felt
sick
and
dizzy
as
he
gazed
on
them
but
he
was
recalled
to
himself
as
the
clerk
of
arraigns
pronounced
the
solemn
words
of
glennaquoich

called
vich

you
and
each
of
you
stand
attainted
of
high
treason
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourselves
why
the
court
should
not
pronounce
judgment
against
you
that
you
die
according
to
law
fergus
as
the
presiding
judge
was
putting
on
the
fatal
cap
of
judgment
placed
his
own
bonnet
upon
his
head
regarded
him
with
a
steadfast
and
stern
look
and
replied
in
a
firm
voice
can
not
let
this
numerous
audience
suppose
that
to
such
an
appeal
i
have
no
answer
to
make
but
what
i
have
to
say
you
would
not
bear
to
hear
for
my
defence
would
be
your
condemnation
proceed
then
in
the
name
of
god
to
do
what
is
permitted
to
you
yesterday
and
the
day
before
you
have
condemned
loyal
and
honourable
blood
to
be
poured
forth
like
water
spare
not
mine
were
that
of
all
my
ancestors
in
my
veins
i
would
have
perilled
it
in
this
quarrel
he
resumed
his
seat
and
refused
again
to
rise
evan
maccombich
looked
at
him
with
great
earnestness
and
rising
up
seemed
anxious
to
speak
but
the
confusion
of
the
court
and
the
perplexity
arising
from
thinking
in
a
language
different
from
that
in
which
he
was
to
express
himself
kept
him
silent
there
was
a
murmur
of
compassion
among
the
spectators
from
the
idea
that
the
poor
fellow
intended
to
plead
the
influence
of
his
superior
as
an
excuse
for
his
crime
the
judge
commanded
silence
and
encouraged
evan
to
proceed
was
only
ganging
to
say
my
lord
said
evan
in
what
he
meant
to
be
an
insinuating
manner
if
your
excellent
honour
and
the
honourable
court
would
let
vich
ian
vohr
go
free
just
this
once
and
let
him
gae
back
to
france
and
no
to
trouble
king
george
government
again
that
ony
six
o
the
very
best
of
his
clan
will
be
willing
to
be
justified
in
his
stead
and
if
you
just
let
me
gae
down
to
glennaquoich
i
fetch
them
up
to
ye
mysell
to
head
or
hang
and
you
may
begin
wi
me
the
very
first
man
notwithstanding
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
a
sort
of
laugh
was
heard
in
the
court
at
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
proposal
the
judge
checked
this
indecency
and
evan
looking
sternly
around
when
the
murmur
abated
the
saxon
gentlemen
are
laughing
he
said
a
poor
man
such
as
me
thinks
my
life
or
the
life
of
six
of
my
degree
is
worth
that
of
vich
ian
vohr
it
like
enough
they
may
be
very
right
but
if
they
laugh
because
they
think
i
would
not
keep
my
word
and
come
back
to
redeem
him
i
can
tell
them
they
ken
neither
the
heart
of
a
hielandman
nor
the
honour
of
a
gentleman
there
was
no
farther
inclination
to
laugh
among
the
audience
and
a
dead
silence
ensued
the
judge
then
pronounced
upon
both
prisoners
the
sentence
of
the
law
of
high
treason
with
all
its
horrible
accompaniments
the
execution
was
appointed
for
the
ensuing
day
you
fergus
ivor
continued
the
judge
can
hold
out
no
hope
of
mercy
you
must
prepare
against
for
your
last
sufferings
here
and
your
great
audit
hereafter
desire
nothing
else
my
lord
answered
fergus
in
the
same
manly
and
firm
tone
the
hard
eyes
of
evan
which
had
been
perpetually
bent
on
his
chief
were
moistened
with
a
tear
you
poor
ignorant
man
continued
the
judge
following
the
ideas
in
which
you
have
been
educated
have
this
day
given
us
a
striking
example
how
the
loyalty
due
to
the
king
and
state
alone
is
from
your
unhappy
ideas
of
clanship
transferred
to
some
ambitious
individual
who
ends
by
making
you
the
tool
of
his
crimes
for
you
i
say
i
feel
so
much
compassion
that
if
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
petition
for
grace
i
will
endeavour
to
procure
it
for
you
otherwise
me
no
grace
said
evan
you
are
to
shed
vich
ian
vohr
blood
the
only
favour
i
would
accept
from
you
is
to
bid
them
loose
my
hands
and
gie
me
my
claymore
and
bide
you
just
a
minute
sitting
where
you
are
the
prisoners
said
the
judge
blood
be
upon
his
own
head
almost
stupefied
with
his
feelings
edward
found
that
the
rush
of
the
crowd
had
conveyed
him
out
into
the
street
ere
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
his
immediate
wish
was
to
see
and
speak
with
fergus
once
more
he
applied
at
the
castle
where
his
unfortunate
friend
was
confined
but
was
refused
admittance
high
sheriff
a
officer
said
requested
of
the
governor
that
none
should
be
admitted
to
see
the
prisoner
excepting
his
confessor
and
his
sister
where
was
miss
they
gave
him
the
direction
it
was
the
house
of
a
respectable
catholic
family
near
carlisle
repulsed
from
the
gate
of
the
castle
and
not
venturing
to
make
application
to
the
high
sheriff
or
judges
in
his
own
unpopular
name
he
had
recourse
to
the
solicitor
who
came
down
in
behalf
this
gentleman
told
him
that
it
was
thought
the
public
mind
was
in
danger
of
being
debauched
by
the
account
of
the
last
moments
of
these
persons
as
given
by
the
friends
of
the
pretender
that
there
had
been
a
resolution
therefore
to
exclude
all
such
persons
as
had
not
the
plea
of
near
kindred
for
attending
upon
them
yet
he
promised
to
oblige
the
heir
of
to
get
him
an
order
for
admittance
to
the
prisoner
the
next
morning
before
his
irons
were
knocked
off
for
execution

of

of
fergus
the
bold
the
chivalrous
the
the
lofty
chieftain
of
a
tribe
devoted
to
him
is
it
he
that
i
have
seen
lead
the
chase
and
head
the
attack
the
brave
the
active
the
young
the
noble
the
love
of
ladies
and
the
theme
of
song
is
it
he
who
is
ironed
like
a
malefactor
who
is
to
be
dragged
on
a
hurdle
to
the
common
gallows
to
die
a
lingering
and
cruel
death
and
to
be
mangled
by
the
hand
of
the
most
outcast
of
wretches
evil
indeed
was
the
spectre
that
boded
such
a
fate
as
this
to
the
brave
chief
of
glennaquoich
with
a
faltering
voice
he
requested
the
solicitor
to
find
means
to
warn
fergus
of
his
intended
visit
should
he
obtain
permission
to
make
it
he
then
turned
away
from
him
and
returning
to
the
inn
wrote
a
scarcely
intelligible
note
to
flora
intimating
his
purpose
to
wait
upon
her
that
evening
the
messenger
brought
back
a
letter
in
flora
beautiful
italian
hand
which
seemed
scarce
to
tremble
even
under
this
load
of
misery
flora
ivor
the
letter
bore
not
refuse
to
see
the
dearest
friend
of
her
dear
brother
even
in
her
present
circumstances
of
unparalleled
distress
when
edward
reached
miss
present
place
of
abode
he
was
instantly
admitted
in
a
large
and
gloomy
tapestried
apartment
flora
was
seated
by
a
latticed
window
sewing
what
seemed
to
be
a
garment
of
white
flannel
at
a
little
distance
sat
an
elderly
woman
apparently
a
foreigner
and
of
a
religious
order
she
was
reading
in
a
book
of
catholic
devotion
but
when
waverley
entered
laid
it
on
the
table
and
left
the
room
flora
rose
to
receive
him
and
stretched
out
her
hand
but
neither
ventured
to
attempt
speech
her
fine
complexion
was
totally
gone
her
person
considerably
emaciated
and
her
face
and
hands
as
white
as
the
purest
statuary
marble
forming
a
strong
contrast
with
her
sable
dress
and
hair
yet
amid
these
marks
of
distress
there
was
nothing
negligent
or
about
her
attire
even
her
hair
though
totally
without
ornament
was
disposed
with
her
usual
attention
to
neatness
the
first
words
she
uttered
were
you
seen
him
no
answered
waverley
have
been
refused
admittance
accords
with
the
rest
she
said
we
must
submit
shall
you
obtain
leave
do
you
suppose
for
tomorrow
said
waverley
but
muttering
the
last
word
so
faintly
that
it
was
almost
unintelligible
then
or
never
said
flora
she
added
looking
upward
time
when
i
trust
we
shall
all
meet
but
i
hope
you
will
see
him
while
earth
yet
bears
him
he
always
loved
you
at
his
heart
though
but
it
is
vain
to
talk
of
the
past
indeed
echoed
waverley
even
of
the
future
my
good
friend
said
flora
far
as
earthly
events
are
concerned
for
how
often
have
i
pictured
to
myself
the
strong
possibility
of
this
horrid
issue
and
tasked
myself
to
consider
how
i
could
support
my
part
and
yet
how
far
has
all
my
anticipation
fallen
short
of
the
unimaginable
bitterness
of
this
hour
flora
if
your
strength
of
mind
there
it
is
she
answered
somewhat
wildly
is
waverley
there
is
a
busy
devil
at
my
heart
that
whispers
but
it
were
madness
to
listen
to
it
that
the
strength
of
mind
on
which
flora
prided
herself
has
murdered
her
brother
god
how
can
you
give
utterance
to
a
thought
so
shocking
is
it
not
so
but
yet
it
haunts
me
like
a
phantom
i
know
it
is
unsubstantial
and
vain
but
it
will
be
present
will
intrude
its
horrors
on
my
mind
will
whisper
that
my
brother
as
volatile
as
ardent
would
have
divided
his
energies
amid
a
hundred
objects
it
was
i
who
taught
him
to
concentrate
them
and
to
gage
all
on
this
dreadful
and
desperate
cast
oh
that
i
could
recollect
that
i
had
but
once
said
to
him
he
that
striketh
with
the
sword
shall
die
by
the
sword
that
i
had
but
once
said
remain
at
home
reserve
yourself
your
vassals
your
life
for
enterprises
within
the
reach
of
man
but
o
waverley
i
spurred
his
fiery
temper
and
half
of
his
ruin
at
least
lies
with
his
sister
the
horrid
idea
which
she
had
intimated
edward
endeavoured
to
combat
by
every
incoherent
argument
that
occurred
to
him
he
recalled
to
her
the
principles
on
which
both
thought
it
their
duty
to
act
and
in
which
they
had
been
educated
not
think
i
have
forgotten
them
she
said
looking
up
with
eager
quickness
do
not
regret
his
attempt
because
it
was
wrong
o
no
on
that
point
i
am
armed
but
because
it
was
impossible
it
could
end
otherwise
than
thus
it
did
not
always
seem
so
desperate
and
hazardous
as
it
was
and
it
would
have
been
chosen
by
the
bold
spirit
of
fergus
whether
you
had
approved
it
or
no
your
counsels
only
served
to
give
unity
and
consistence
to
his
conduct
to
dignify
but
not
to
precipitate
his
resolution
flora
had
soon
ceased
to
listen
to
edward
and
was
again
intent
upon
her
needlework
you
remember
she
said
looking
up
with
a
ghastly
smile
once
found
me
making
fergus
and
now
i
am
sewing
his
bridal
garment
our
friends
here
she
continued
with
suppressed
emotion
to
give
hallowed
earth
in
their
chapel
to
the
bloody
relics
of
the
last
vich
ian
vohr
but
they
will
not
all
rest
together
no
his
head
i
shall
not
have
the
last
miserable
consolation
of
kissing
the
cold
lips
of
my
dear
dear
fergus
the
unfortunate
flora
here
after
one
or
two
hysterical
sobs
fainted
in
her
chair
the
lady
who
had
been
attending
in
the
now
entered
hastily
and
begged
edward
to
leave
the
room
but
not
the
house
when
he
was
recalled
after
the
space
of
nearly
half
an
hour
he
found
that
by
a
strong
effort
miss
had
greatly
composed
herself
it
was
then
he
ventured
to
urge
miss
bradwardine
claim
to
be
considered
as
an
adopted
sister
and
empowered
to
assist
her
plans
for
the
future
have
had
a
letter
from
my
dear
rose
she
replied
the
same
purpose
sorrow
is
selfish
and
engrossing
or
i
would
have
written
to
express
that
even
in
my
own
despair
i
felt
a
gleam
of
pleasure
at
learning
her
happy
prospects
and
at
hearing
that
the
good
old
baron
has
escaped
the
general
wreck
give
this
to
my
dearest
rose
it
is
her
poor
flora
only
ornament
of
value
and
was
the
gift
of
a
princess
she
put
into
his
hands
a
case
containing
the
chain
of
diamonds
with
which
she
used
to
decorate
her
hair
me
it
is
in
future
useless
the
kindness
of
my
friends
has
secured
me
a
retreat
in
the
convent
of
the
scottish
benedictine
nuns
in
paris
tomorrow
if
indeed
i
can
survive
tomorrow
i
set
forward
on
my
journey
with
this
venerable
sister
and
now
waverley
adieu
may
you
be
as
happy
with
rose
as
your
amiable
dispositions
deserve
and
think
sometimes
on
the
friends
you
have
lost
do
not
attempt
to
see
me
again
it
would
be
mistaken
kindness
she
gave
him
her
hand
on
which
edward
shed
a
torrent
of
tears
and
with
a
faltering
step
withdrew
from
the
apartment
and
returned
to
the
town
of
carlisle
at
the
inn
he
found
a
letter
from
his
law
friend
intimating
that
he
would
be
admitted
to
fergus
next
morning
as
soon
as
the
castle
gates
were
opened
and
permitted
to
remain
with
him
till
the
arrival
of
the
sheriff
gave
signal
for
the
fatal
procession
chapter
lxix
a
darker
departure
is
near
the
death
drum
is
muffled
and
sable
the
bier
campbell
after
a
sleepless
night
the
first
dawn
of
morning
found
waverley
on
the
esplanade
in
front
of
the
old
gothic
gate
of
carlisle
castle
but
he
paced
it
long
in
every
direction
before
the
hour
when
according
to
the
rules
of
the
garrison
the
gates
were
opened
and
the
lowered
he
produced
his
order
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
and
was
admitted
the
place
of
fergus
confinement
was
a
gloomy
and
vaulted
apartment
in
the
central
part
of
the
castle
a
huge
old
tower
supposed
to
be
of
great
antiquity
and
surrounded
by
outworks
seemingly
of
henry
viii
time
or
somewhat
later
the
grating
of
the
large
bars
and
bolts
withdrawn
for
the
purpose
of
admitting
edward
was
answered
by
the
clash
of
chains
as
the
unfortunate
chieftain
strongly
and
heavily
fettered
shuffled
along
the
stone
floor
of
his
prison
to
fling
himself
into
his
friend
arms
dear
edward
he
said
in
a
firm
and
even
cheerful
voice
is
truly
kind
i
heard
of
your
approaching
happiness
with
the
highest
pleasure
and
how
does
rose
and
how
is
our
old
whimsical
friend
the
baron
well
i
trust
since
i
see
you
at
freedom
and
how
will
you
settle
precedence
between
the
three
ermines
passant
and
the
bear
and
o
how
my
dear
fergus
can
you
talk
of
such
things
at
such
a
moment
we
have
entered
carlisle
with
happier
auspices
to
be
sure
on
the
of
november
last
for
example
when
we
marched
in
side
by
side
and
hoisted
the
white
flag
on
these
ancient
towers
but
i
am
no
boy
to
sit
down
and
weep
because
the
luck
has
gone
against
me
i
knew
the
stake
which
i
risked
we
played
the
game
boldly
and
the
forfeit
shall
be
paid
manfully
and
now
since
my
time
is
short
let
me
come
to
the
questions
that
interest
me
most
the
prince
has
he
escaped
the
bloodhounds
has
and
is
in
safety
be
god
for
that
tell
me
the
particulars
of
his
escape
waverley
communicated
that
remarkable
history
so
far
as
it
had
then
transpired
to
which
fergus
listened
with
deep
interest
he
then
asked
after
several
other
friends
and
made
many
minute
inquiries
concerning
the
fate
of
his
own
clansmen
they
had
suffered
less
than
other
tribes
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
affair
for
having
in
a
great
measure
dispersed
and
returned
home
after
the
captivity
of
their
chieftain
according
to
the
universal
custom
of
the
highlanders
they
were
not
in
arms
when
the
insurrection
was
finally
suppressed
and
consequently
were
treated
with
less
rigour
this
fergus
heard
with
great
satisfaction
are
rich
he
said
and
you
are
generous
when
you
hear
of
these
poor
being
distressed
about
their
miserable
possessions
by
some
harsh
overseer
or
agent
of
government
remember
you
have
worn
their
tartan
and
are
an
adopted
son
of
their
race
the
baron
who
knows
our
manners
and
lives
near
our
country
will
apprise
you
of
the
time
and
means
to
be
their
protector
will
you
promise
this
to
the
last
vich
ian
vohr
edward
as
may
well
be
believed
pledged
his
word
which
he
afterwards
so
amply
redeemed
that
his
memory
still
lives
in
these
glens
by
the
name
of
the
friend
of
the
sons
of
ivor
to
god
continued
the
chieftain
could
bequeath
to
you
my
rights
to
the
love
and
obedience
of
this
primitive
and
brave
race
or
at
least
as
i
have
striven
to
do
persuade
poor
evan
to
accept
of
his
life
upon
their
terms
and
be
to
you
what
he
has
been
to
me
the
kindest
the
bravest
the
most
devoted
the
tears
which
his
own
fate
could
not
draw
forth
fell
fast
for
that
of
his
said
he
drying
them
can
not
be
you
can
not
be
to
them
vich
ian
vohr
and
these
three
magic
words
said
he
half
smiling
the
only
open
sesame
to
their
feelings
and
sympathies
and
poor
evan
must
attend
his
in
death
as
he
has
done
through
his
whole
life
i
am
sure
said
maccombich
raising
himself
from
the
floor
on
which
for
fear
of
interrupting
their
conversation
he
had
lain
so
still
that
in
the
obscurity
of
the
apartment
edward
was
not
aware
of
his
presence
am
sure
evan
never
desired
or
deserved
a
better
end
than
just
to
die
with
his
chieftain
now
said
fergus
we
are
upon
the
subject
of
clanship
what
think
you
now
of
the
prediction
of
the
bodach
glas
then
before
edward
could
answer
saw
him
again
last
night
he
stood
in
the
slip
of
moonshine
which
fell
from
that
high
and
narrow
window
towards
my
bed
why
should
i
fear
him
i
thought
long
ere
this
time
i
shall
be
as
immaterial
as
he
false
spirit
i
said
art
thou
come
to
close
thy
walks
on
earth
and
to
enjoy
thy
triumph
in
the
fall
of
the
last
descendant
of
thine
enemy
the
spectre
seemed
to
beckon
and
to
smile
as
he
faded
from
my
sight
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
asked
the
same
question
of
the
priest
who
is
a
good
and
sensible
man
he
admitted
that
the
church
allowed
that
such
apparitions
were
possible
but
urged
me
not
to
permit
my
mind
to
dwell
upon
it
as
imagination
plays
us
such
strange
tricks
what
do
you
think
of
it
as
your
confessor
said
waverley
willing
to
avoid
dispute
upon
such
a
point
at
such
a
moment
a
tap
at
the
door
now
announced
that
good
man
and
edward
retired
while
he
administered
to
both
prisoners
the
last
rites
of
religion
in
the
mode
which
the
church
of
rome
prescribes
in
about
an
hour
he
was
soon
after
a
file
of
soldiers
entered
with
a
blacksmith
who
struck
the
fetters
from
the
legs
of
the
prisoners
see
the
compliment
they
pay
to
our
highland
strength
and
courage
we
have
lain
chained
here
like
wild
beasts
till
our
legs
are
cramped
into
palsy
and
when
they
free
us
they
send
six
soldiers
with
loaded
muskets
to
prevent
our
taking
the
castle
by
storm
edward
afterwards
learned
that
these
severe
precautions
had
been
taken
in
consequence
of
a
desperate
attempt
of
the
prisoners
to
escape
in
which
they
had
very
nearly
succeeded
shortly
afterwards
the
drums
of
the
garrison
beat
to
arms
is
the
last
said
fergus
i
shall
hear
and
obey
and
now
my
dear
dear
edward
ere
we
part
let
us
speak
of
flora
a
subject
which
awakes
the
tenderest
feeling
that
yet
thrills
within
part
not
here
said
waverley
yes
we
do
you
must
come
no
farther
not
that
i
fear
what
is
to
follow
for
myself
he
said
proudly
has
her
tortures
as
well
as
art
and
how
happy
should
we
think
the
man
who
escapes
from
the
throes
of
a
mortal
and
painful
disorder
in
the
space
of
a
short
half
hour
and
this
matter
spin
it
out
as
they
will
can
not
last
longer
but
what
a
dying
man
can
suffer
firmly
may
kill
a
living
friend
to
look
upon
this
same
law
of
high
treason
he
continued
with
astonishing
firmness
and
composure
one
of
the
blessings
edward
with
which
your
free
country
has
accommodated
poor
old
scotland
her
own
jurisprudence
as
i
have
heard
was
much
milder
but
i
suppose
one
day
or
other
when
there
are
no
longer
any
wild
highlanders
to
benefit
by
its
tender
mercies
they
will
blot
it
from
their
records
as
levelling
them
with
a
nation
of
cannibals
the
mummery
too
of
exposing
the
senseless
head
they
have
not
the
wit
to
grace
mine
with
a
paper
coronet
there
would
be
some
satire
in
that
edward
i
hope
they
will
set
it
on
the
scotch
gate
though
that
i
may
look
even
after
death
to
the
blue
hills
of
my
own
country
which
i
love
so
dearly
the
baron
would
have
added
moritur
et
moriens
dukes
reminiscitur
argos
a
bustle
and
the
sound
of
wheels
and
horses
feet
was
now
heard
in
the
of
the
castle
i
have
told
you
why
you
must
not
follow
me
and
these
sounds
admonish
me
that
my
time
flies
fast
tell
me
how
you
found
poor
flora
waverley
with
a
voice
interrupted
by
suffocating
sensations
gave
some
account
of
the
state
of
her
mind
flora
answered
the
chief
could
have
borne
her
own
sentence
of
death
but
not
mine
you
waverley
will
soon
know
the
happiness
of
mutual
affection
in
the
married
state
long
long
may
rose
and
you
enjoy
it
but
you
can
never
know
the
purity
of
feeling
which
combines
two
orphans
like
flora
and
me
left
alone
as
it
were
in
the
world
and
being
all
in
all
to
each
other
from
our
very
infancy
but
her
strong
sense
of
duty
and
predominant
feeling
of
loyalty
will
give
new
nerve
to
her
mind
after
the
immediate
and
acute
sensation
of
this
parting
has
passed
away
she
will
then
think
of
fergus
as
of
the
heroes
of
our
race
upon
whose
deeds
she
loved
to
dwell
she
not
see
you
then
asked
waverley
seemed
to
expect
it
necessary
deceit
will
spare
her
the
last
dreadful
parting
i
could
not
part
with
her
without
tears
and
i
can
not
bear
that
these
men
should
think
they
have
power
to
extort
them
she
was
made
to
believe
she
would
see
me
at
a
later
hour
and
this
letter
which
my
confessor
will
deliver
will
apprise
her
that
all
is
over
an
officer
now
appeared
and
intimated
that
the
high
sheriff
and
his
attendants
waited
before
the
gate
of
the
castle
to
claim
the
bodies
of
fergus
and
evan
maccombich
come
said
fergus
accordingly
supporting
edward
by
the
arm
and
followed
by
evan
dhu
and
the
priest
he
moved
down
the
stairs
of
the
tower
the
soldiers
bringing
up
the
rear
the
court
was
occupied
by
a
squadron
of
dragoons
and
a
battalion
of
infantry
drawn
up
in
hollow
square
within
their
ranks
was
the
sledge
or
hurdle
on
which
the
prisoners
were
to
be
drawn
to
the
place
of
execution
about
a
mile
distant
from
carlisle
it
was
painted
black
and
drawn
by
a
white
horse
at
one
end
of
the
vehicle
sat
the
executioner
a
fellow
as
beseemed
his
trade
with
the
broad
axe
in
his
hand
at
the
other
end
next
the
horse
was
an
empty
seat
for
two
persons
through
the
deep
and
dark
gothic
archway
that
opened
on
the
drawbridge
were
seen
on
horseback
the
high
sheriff
and
his
attendants
whom
the
etiquette
betwixt
the
civil
and
military
powers
did
not
permit
to
come
farther
is
well
got
up
for
a
closing
scene
said
fergus
smiling
disdainfully
as
he
gazed
around
upon
the
apparatus
of
terror
evan
dhu
exclaimed
with
some
eagerness
after
looking
at
the
dragoons
these
are
the
very
chields
that
galloped
off
at
gladsmuir
before
we
could
kill
a
dozen
o
them
they
look
bold
enough
now
however
the
priest
entreated
him
to
be
silent
the
sledge
now
approached
and
fergus
turning
round
embraced
waverley
kissed
him
on
each
side
of
the
face
and
stepped
nimbly
into
his
place
evan
sat
down
by
his
side
the
priest
was
to
follow
in
a
carriage
belonging
to
his
patron
the
catholic
gentleman
at
whose
house
flora
resided
as
fergus
waved
his
hand
to
edward
the
ranks
closed
around
the
sledge
and
the
whole
procession
began
to
move
forward
there
was
a
momentary
stop
at
the
gateway
while
the
governor
of
the
castle
and
the
high
sheriff
went
through
a
short
ceremony
the
military
officer
there
delivering
over
the
persons
of
the
criminals
to
the
civil
power
save
king
george
said
the
high
sheriff
when
the
formality
concluded
fergus
stood
erect
in
the
sledge
and
with
a
firm
and
steady
voice
replied
god
save
king
james
these
were
the
last
words
which
waverley
heard
him
speak
the
procession
resumed
its
march
and
the
sledge
vanished
from
beneath
the
portal
under
which
it
had
stopped
for
an
instant
the
dead
march
was
then
heard
and
its
melancholy
sounds
were
mingled
with
those
of
a
muffled
peal
tolled
from
the
neighbouring
cathedral
the
sound
of
military
music
died
away
as
the
procession
moved
on
the
sullen
clang
of
the
bells
was
soon
heard
to
sound
alone
the
last
of
the
soldiers
had
now
disappeared
from
under
the
vaulted
archway
through
which
they
had
been
filing
for
several
minutes
the
was
now
totally
empty
but
waverley
still
stood
there
as
if
stupefied
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dark
pass
where
he
had
so
lately
seen
the
last
glimpse
of
his
friend
at
length
a
female
servant
of
the
governor
struck
with
compassion
at
the
stupefied
misery
which
his
countenance
expressed
asked
him
if
he
would
not
walk
into
her
master
house
and
sit
down
she
was
obliged
to
repeat
her
question
twice
ere
he
comprehended
her
but
at
length
it
recalled
him
to
himself
declining
the
courtesy
by
a
hasty
gesture
he
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
leaving
the
castle
walked
as
swiftly
as
he
could
through
the
empty
streets
till
he
regained
his
inn
then
rushed
into
an
apartment
and
bolted
the
door
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
which
seemed
an
age
of
unutterable
suspense
the
sound
of
the
drums
and
fifes
performing
a
lively
air
and
the
confused
murmur
of
the
crowd
which
now
filled
the
streets
so
lately
deserted
apprised
him
that
all
was
finished
and
that
the
military
and
populace
were
returning
from
the
dreadful
scene
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
his
sensations
in
the
evening
the
priest
made
him
a
visit
and
informed
him
that
he
did
so
by
directions
of
his
deceased
friend
to
assure
him
that
fergus
had
died
as
he
lived
and
remembered
his
friendship
to
the
last
he
added
he
had
also
seen
flora
whose
state
of
mind
seemed
more
composed
since
all
was
over
with
her
and
sister
theresa
the
priest
proposed
next
day
to
leave
carlisle
for
the
nearest
seaport
from
which
they
could
embark
for
france
waverley
forced
on
this
good
man
a
ring
of
some
value
and
a
sum
of
money
to
be
employed
as
he
thought
might
gratify
flora
in
the
services
of
the
catholic
church
for
the
memory
of
his
friend
inani
munere
he
repeated
as
the
ecclesiastic
retired
why
not
class
these
acts
of
remembrance
with
other
honours
with
which
affection
in
all
sects
pursues
the
memory
of
the
dead
the
next
morning
ere
daylight
he
took
leave
of
the
town
of
carlisle
promising
to
himself
never
again
to
enter
its
walls
he
dared
hardly
look
back
towards
the
gothic
battlements
of
the
fortified
gate
under
which
he
passed
for
the
place
is
surrounded
with
an
old
wall
no
there
said
alick
polwarth
who
guessed
the
cause
of
the
dubious
look
which
waverley
cast
backward
and
who
with
the
vulgar
appetite
for
the
horrible
was
master
of
each
detail
of
the
butchery
heads
are
ower
the
scotch
yate
as
they
ca
it
it
a
great
pity
of
evan
dhu
who
was
a
very
man
to
be
a
hielandman
and
indeed
so
was
the
laird
o
glennaquoich
too
for
that
matter
when
he
wasna
in
ane
o
his
tirrivies
chapter
lxx
dulce
domum
the
impression
of
horror
with
which
waverley
left
carlisle
softened
by
degrees
into
melancholy
a
gradation
which
was
accelerated
by
the
painful
yet
soothing
task
of
writing
to
rose
and
while
he
could
not
suppress
his
own
feelings
of
the
calamity
he
endeavoured
to
place
it
in
a
light
which
might
grieve
her
without
shocking
her
imagination
the
picture
which
he
drew
for
her
benefit
he
gradually
familiarised
to
his
own
mind
and
his
next
letters
were
more
cheerful
and
referred
to
the
prospects
of
peace
and
happiness
which
lay
before
them
yet
though
his
first
horrible
sensations
had
sunk
into
melancholy
edward
had
reached
his
native
country
before
he
could
as
usual
on
former
occasions
look
round
for
enjoyment
upon
the
face
of
nature
he
then
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
edinburgh
began
to
experience
that
pleasure
which
almost
all
feel
who
return
to
a
verdant
populous
and
highly
cultivated
country
from
scenes
of
waste
desolation
or
of
solitary
and
melancholy
grandeur
but
how
were
those
feelings
enhanced
when
he
entered
on
the
domain
so
long
possessed
by
his
forefathers
recognised
the
old
oaks
of
chace
thought
with
what
delight
he
should
introduce
rose
to
all
his
favourite
haunts
beheld
at
length
the
towers
of
the
venerable
hall
arise
above
the
woods
which
embowered
it
and
finally
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
venerable
relations
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
duty
and
affection
the
happiness
of
their
meeting
was
not
tarnished
by
a
single
word
of
reproach
on
the
contrary
whatever
pain
sir
everard
and
rachel
had
felt
during
waverley
perilous
engagement
with
the
young
chevalier
it
assorted
too
well
with
the
principles
in
which
they
had
been
brought
up
to
incur
reprobation
or
even
censure
colonel
talbot
also
had
smoothed
the
way
with
great
address
for
edward
favourable
reception
by
dwelling
upon
his
gallant
behaviour
in
the
military
character
particularly
his
bravery
and
generosity
at
preston
until
warmed
at
the
idea
of
their
engaging
in
single
combat
making
prisoner
and
saving
from
slaughter
so
distinguished
an
officer
as
the
colonel
himself
the
imagination
of
the
baronet
and
his
sister
ranked
the
exploits
of
edward
with
those
of
wilibert
hildebrand
and
nigel
the
vaunted
heroes
of
their
line
the
appearance
of
waverley
embrowned
by
exercise
and
dignified
by
the
habits
of
military
discipline
had
acquired
an
athletic
and
hardy
character
which
not
only
verified
the
colonel
narration
but
surprised
and
delighted
all
the
inhabitants
of
honour
they
crowded
to
see
to
hear
him
and
to
sing
his
praises
pembroke
who
secretly
extolled
his
spirit
and
courage
in
embracing
the
genuine
cause
of
the
church
of
england
censured
his
pupil
gently
nevertheless
for
being
so
careless
of
his
manuscripts
which
indeed
he
said
had
occasioned
him
some
personal
inconvenience
as
upon
the
baronet
being
arrested
by
a
king
messenger
he
had
deemed
it
prudent
to
retire
to
a
concealment
called
priest
hole
from
the
use
it
had
been
put
to
in
former
days
where
he
assured
our
hero
the
butler
had
thought
it
safe
to
venture
with
food
only
once
in
the
day
so
that
he
had
been
repeatedly
compelled
to
dine
upon
victuals
either
absolutely
cold
or
what
was
worse
only
half
warm
not
to
mention
that
sometimes
his
bed
had
not
been
arranged
for
two
days
together
waverley
mind
involuntarily
turned
to
the
patmos
of
the
baron
of
bradwardine
who
was
well
pleased
with
janet
fare
and
a
few
bunches
of
straw
stowed
in
a
cleft
in
the
front
of
a
but
he
made
no
remarks
upon
a
contrast
which
could
only
mortify
his
worthy
tutor
all
was
now
in
a
bustle
to
prepare
for
the
nuptials
of
edward
an
event
to
which
the
good
old
baronet
and
rachel
looked
forward
as
if
to
the
renewal
of
their
own
youth
the
match
as
colonel
talbot
had
intimated
had
seemed
to
them
in
the
highest
degree
eligible
having
every
recommendation
but
wealth
of
which
they
themselves
had
more
than
enough
clippurse
was
therefore
summoned
to
under
better
auspices
than
at
the
commencement
of
our
story
but
clippurse
came
not
alone
for
being
now
stricken
in
years
he
had
associated
with
him
a
nephew
a
younger
vulture
as
our
english
juvenal
who
tells
the
tale
of
swallow
the
attorney
might
have
called
him
and
they
now
carried
on
business
as
clippurse
and
hookem
these
worthy
gentlemen
had
directions
to
make
the
necessary
settlements
on
the
most
splendid
scale
of
liberality
as
if
edward
were
to
wed
a
peeress
in
her
own
right
with
her
paternal
estate
tacked
to
the
fringe
of
her
ermine
but
before
entering
upon
a
subject
of
proverbial
delay
i
must
remind
my
reader
of
the
progress
of
a
stone
rolled
downhill
by
an
idle
truant
boy
a
pastime
at
which
i
was
myself
expert
in
my
more
juvenile
years
it
moves
at
first
slowly
avoiding
by
inflection
every
obstacle
of
the
least
importance
but
when
it
has
attained
its
full
impulse
and
draws
near
the
conclusion
of
its
career
it
smokes
and
thunders
down
taking
a
rood
at
every
spring
clearing
hedge
and
ditch
like
a
yorkshire
huntsman
and
becoming
most
furiously
rapid
in
its
course
when
it
is
nearest
to
being
consigned
to
rest
for
ever
even
such
is
the
course
of
a
narrative
like
that
which
you
are
perusing
the
earlier
events
are
studiously
dwelt
upon
that
you
kind
reader
may
be
introduced
to
the
character
rather
by
narrative
than
by
the
duller
medium
of
direct
description
but
when
the
story
draws
near
its
close
we
hurry
over
the
circumstances
however
important
which
your
imagination
must
have
forestalled
and
leave
you
to
suppose
those
things
which
it
would
be
abusing
your
patience
to
relate
at
length
we
are
therefore
so
far
from
attempting
to
trace
the
dull
progress
of
clippurse
and
hookem
or
that
of
their
worthy
official
brethren
who
had
the
charge
of
suing
out
the
pardons
of
edward
waverley
and
his
intended
that
we
can
but
touch
upon
matters
more
attractive
the
mutual
epistles
for
example
which
were
exchanged
between
sir
everard
and
the
baron
upon
this
occasion
though
matchless
specimens
of
eloquence
in
their
way
must
be
consigned
to
merciless
oblivion
nor
can
i
tell
you
at
length
how
worthy
aunt
rachel
not
without
a
delicate
and
affectionate
allusion
to
the
circumstances
which
had
transferred
rose
maternal
diamonds
to
the
hands
of
donald
bean
lean
stocked
her
casket
with
a
set
of
jewels
that
a
duchess
might
have
envied
moreover
the
reader
will
have
the
goodness
to
imagine
that
job
houghton
and
his
dame
were
suitably
provided
for
although
they
could
never
be
persuaded
that
their
son
fell
otherwise
than
fighting
by
the
young
squire
side
so
that
alick
who
as
a
lover
of
truth
had
made
many
needless
attempts
to
expound
the
real
circumstances
to
them
was
finally
ordered
to
say
not
a
word
more
upon
the
subject
he
indemnified
himself
however
by
the
liberal
allowance
of
desperate
battles
grisly
executions
and
and
stories
with
which
he
astonished
the
servants
hall
but
although
these
important
matters
may
be
briefly
told
in
narrative
like
a
newspaper
report
of
a
chancery
suit
yet
with
all
the
urgency
which
waverley
could
use
the
real
time
which
the
law
proceedings
occupied
joined
to
the
delay
occasioned
by
the
mode
of
travelling
at
that
period
rendered
it
considerably
more
than
two
months
ere
waverley
having
left
england
alighted
once
more
at
the
mansion
of
the
laird
of
duchran
to
claim
the
hand
of
his
plighted
bride
the
day
of
his
marriage
was
fixed
for
the
sixth
after
his
arrival
the
baron
of
bradwardine
with
whom
bridals
christenings
and
funerals
were
festivals
of
high
and
solemn
import
felt
a
little
hurt
that
including
the
family
of
the
duchran
and
all
the
immediate
vicinity
who
had
title
to
be
present
on
such
an
occasion
there
could
not
be
above
thirty
persons
collected
he
was
married
he
observed
hundred
horse
of
gentlemen
born
besides
servants
and
some
score
or
two
of
highland
lairds
who
never
got
on
horseback
were
present
on
the
occasion
but
his
pride
found
some
consolation
in
reflecting
that
he
and
his
having
been
so
lately
in
arms
against
government
it
might
give
matter
of
reasonable
fear
and
offence
to
the
ruling
powers
if
they
were
to
collect
together
the
kith
kin
and
allies
of
their
houses
arrayed
in
effeir
of
war
as
was
the
ancient
custom
of
scotland
on
these
occasions
without
dubitation
he
concluded
with
a
sigh
of
those
who
would
have
rejoiced
most
freely
upon
these
joyful
espousals
are
either
gone
to
a
better
place
or
are
now
exiles
from
their
native
land
the
marriage
took
place
on
the
appointed
day
the
reverend
rubrick
kinsman
to
the
proprietor
of
the
hospitable
mansion
where
it
was
solemnised
and
chaplain
to
the
baron
of
bradwardine
had
the
satisfaction
to
unite
their
hands
and
frank
stanley
acted
as
bridesman
having
joined
edward
with
that
view
soon
after
his
arrival
lady
emily
and
colonel
talbot
had
proposed
being
present
but
lady
emily
health
when
the
day
approached
was
found
inadequate
to
the
journey
in
amends
it
was
arranged
that
edward
waverley
and
his
lady
who
with
the
baron
proposed
an
immediate
journey
to
should
in
their
way
spend
a
few
days
at
an
estate
which
colonel
talbot
had
been
tempted
to
purchase
in
scotland
as
a
very
great
bargain
and
at
which
he
proposed
to
reside
for
some
time
chapter
lxxi
this
is
no
mine
ain
house
i
ken
by
the
bigging
old
song
the
nuptial
party
travelled
in
great
style
there
was
a
coach
and
six
after
the
newest
pattern
which
sir
everard
had
presented
to
his
nephew
that
dazzled
with
its
splendour
the
eyes
of
one
half
of
scotland
there
was
the
family
coach
of
rubrick
both
these
were
crowded
with
ladies
and
there
were
gentlemen
on
horseback
with
their
servants
to
the
number
of
a
round
score
nevertheless
without
having
the
fear
of
famine
before
his
eyes
bailie
macwheeble
met
them
in
the
road
to
entreat
that
they
would
pass
by
his
house
at
little
veolan
the
baron
stared
and
said
his
son
and
he
would
certainly
ride
by
little
veolan
and
pay
their
compliments
to
the
bailie
but
could
not
think
of
bringing
with
them
the
comitatus
nuptialis
or
matrimonial
procession
he
added
as
he
understood
that
the
barony
had
been
sold
by
its
unworthy
possessor
he
was
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
duncan
had
regained
his
situation
under
the
new
dominus
or
proprietor
the
bailie
ducked
bowed
and
fidgeted
and
then
again
insisted
upon
his
invitation
until
the
baron
though
rather
piqued
at
the
pertinacity
of
his
instances
could
not
nevertheless
refuse
to
consent
without
making
evident
sensations
which
he
was
anxious
to
conceal
he
fell
into
a
deep
study
as
they
approached
the
top
of
the
avenue
and
was
only
startled
from
it
by
observing
that
the
battlements
were
replaced
the
ruins
cleared
away
and
most
wonderful
of
all
that
the
two
great
stone
bears
those
mutilated
dagons
of
his
idolatry
had
resumed
their
posts
over
the
gateway
this
new
proprietor
said
he
to
edward
shown
mair
gusto
as
the
italians
call
it
in
the
short
time
he
has
had
this
domain
than
that
hound
malcolm
though
i
bred
him
here
mysell
has
acquired
vita
adhuc
durante
and
now
i
talk
of
hounds
is
not
yon
ban
and
buscar
who
come
scouping
up
the
avenue
with
davie
gellatley
vote
we
should
go
to
meet
them
sir
said
waverley
i
believe
the
present
master
of
the
house
is
colonel
talbot
who
will
expect
to
see
us
we
hesitated
to
mention
to
you
at
first
that
he
had
purchased
your
ancient
patrimonial
property
and
even
yet
if
you
do
not
incline
to
visit
him
we
can
pass
on
to
the
bailie
the
baron
had
occasion
for
all
his
magnanimity
however
he
drew
a
long
breath
took
a
long
snuff
and
observed
since
they
had
brought
him
so
far
he
could
not
pass
the
colonel
gate
and
he
would
be
happy
to
see
the
new
master
of
his
old
tenants
he
alighted
accordingly
as
did
the
other
gentlemen
and
ladies
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
daughter
and
as
they
descended
the
avenue
pointed
out
to
her
how
speedily
the
pecunia
of
the
southron
their
tutelary
deity
he
might
call
her
had
removed
the
marks
of
spoliation
in
truth
not
only
had
the
felled
trees
been
removed
but
their
stumps
being
grubbed
up
and
the
earth
round
them
levelled
and
sown
with
grass
every
mark
of
devastation
unless
to
an
eye
intimately
acquainted
with
the
spot
was
already
totally
obliterated
there
was
a
similar
reformation
in
the
outward
man
of
davie
gellatley
who
met
them
every
now
and
then
stopping
to
admire
the
new
suit
which
graced
his
person
in
the
same
colours
as
formerly
but
bedizened
fine
enough
to
have
served
touchstone
himself
he
danced
up
with
his
usual
ungainly
frolics
first
to
the
baron
and
then
to
rose
passing
his
hands
over
his
clothes
crying
davie
and
scarce
able
to
sing
a
bar
to
an
end
of
his
songs
for
the
breathless
extravagance
of
his
joy
the
dogs
also
acknowledged
their
old
master
with
a
thousand
gambols
my
conscience
rose
ejaculated
the
baron
gratitude
o
thae
dumb
brutes
and
of
that
puir
innocent
brings
the
tears
into
my
auld
een
while
that
schellum
malcolm
but
i
obliged
to
colonel
talbot
for
putting
my
hounds
into
such
good
condition
and
likewise
for
puir
davie
but
rose
my
dear
we
must
not
permit
them
to
be
a
burden
upon
the
estate
as
he
spoke
lady
emily
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
her
husband
met
the
party
at
the
lower
gate
with
a
thousand
welcomes
after
the
ceremony
of
introduction
had
been
gone
through
much
abridged
by
the
ease
and
excellent
breeding
of
lady
emily
she
apologised
for
having
used
a
little
art
to
wile
them
back
to
a
place
which
might
awaken
some
painful
reflections
as
it
was
to
change
masters
we
were
very
desirous
that
the
baron
bradwardine
madam
if
you
please
said
the
old
bradwardine
then
and
waverley
should
see
what
we
have
done
towards
restoring
the
mansion
of
your
fathers
to
its
former
state
the
baron
answered
with
a
low
bow
indeed
when
he
entered
the
court
excepting
that
the
heavy
stables
which
had
been
burnt
down
were
replaced
by
buildings
of
a
lighter
and
more
picturesque
appearance
all
seemed
as
much
as
possible
restored
to
the
state
in
which
he
had
left
it
when
he
assumed
arms
some
months
before
the
was
replenished
the
fountain
played
with
its
usual
activity
and
not
only
the
bear
who
predominated
over
its
basin
but
all
the
other
bears
whatsoever
were
replaced
on
their
several
stations
and
renewed
or
repaired
with
so
much
care
that
they
bore
no
tokens
of
the
violence
which
had
so
lately
descended
upon
them
while
these
minutiae
had
been
so
needfully
attended
to
it
is
scarce
necessary
to
add
that
the
house
itself
had
been
thoroughly
repaired
as
well
as
the
gardens
with
the
strictest
attention
to
maintain
the
original
character
of
both
and
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
all
appearance
of
the
ravage
they
had
sustained
the
baron
gazed
in
silent
wonder
at
length
he
addressed
colonel
talbot
i
acknowledge
my
obligation
to
you
sir
for
the
restoration
of
the
badge
of
our
family
i
can
not
but
marvel
that
you
have
nowhere
established
your
own
crest
whilk
is
i
believe
a
mastiff
anciently
called
a
talbot
as
the
poet
has
it
a
talbot
strong
a
sturdy
tyke
at
least
such
a
dog
is
the
crest
of
the
martial
and
renowned
earls
of
shrewsbury
to
whom
your
family
are
probably
believe
said
the
colonel
smiling
dogs
are
whelps
of
the
same
litter
for
my
part
if
crests
were
to
dispute
precedence
i
should
be
apt
to
let
them
as
the
proverb
says
fight
dog
fight
bear
as
he
made
this
speech
at
which
the
baron
took
another
long
pinch
of
snuff
they
had
entered
the
house
that
is
the
baron
rose
and
lady
emily
with
young
stanley
and
the
bailie
for
edward
and
the
rest
of
the
party
remained
on
the
terrace
to
examine
a
new
greenhouse
stocked
with
the
finest
plants
the
baron
resumed
his
favourite
topic
it
may
please
you
to
derogate
from
the
honour
of
your
burgonet
colonel
talbot
which
is
doubtless
your
humour
as
i
have
seen
in
other
gentlemen
of
birth
and
honour
in
your
country
i
must
again
repeat
it
as
a
most
ancient
and
distinguished
bearing
as
well
as
that
of
my
young
friend
francis
stanley
which
is
the
eagle
and
child
bird
and
bantling
they
call
it
in
derbyshire
sir
said
stanley
a
daft
callant
sir
said
the
baron
who
had
a
great
liking
to
this
young
man
perhaps
because
he
sometimes
teased
him
a
daft
callant
and
i
must
correct
you
some
of
these
days
shaking
his
great
brown
fist
at
him
what
i
meant
to
say
colonel
talbot
is
that
yours
is
an
ancient
prosapia
or
descent
and
since
you
have
lawfully
and
justly
acquired
the
estate
for
you
and
yours
which
i
have
lost
for
me
and
mine
i
wish
it
may
remain
in
your
name
as
many
centuries
as
it
has
done
in
that
of
the
late
proprietor
answered
the
colonel
very
handsome
bradwardine
indeed
yet
sir
i
can
not
but
marvel
that
you
colonel
whom
i
noted
to
have
so
much
of
the
amor
patritz
when
we
met
in
edinburgh
as
even
to
vilipend
other
countries
should
have
chosen
to
establish
your
lares
or
household
gods
procul
a
patrice
finibus
and
in
a
manner
to
expatriate
yourself
really
baron
i
do
not
see
why
to
keep
the
secret
of
these
foolish
boys
waverley
and
stanley
and
of
my
wife
who
is
no
wiser
one
old
soldier
should
continue
to
impose
upon
another
you
must
know
then
that
i
have
so
much
of
that
same
prejudice
in
favour
of
my
native
country
that
the
sum
of
money
which
i
advanced
to
the
seller
of
this
extensive
barony
has
only
purchased
for
me
a
box
in
shire
called
lodge
with
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
land
the
chief
merit
of
which
is
that
it
is
within
a
very
few
miles
of
who
then
in
the
name
of
heaven
has
bought
this
property
said
the
colonel
is
this
gentleman

to
explain
the
bailie
whom
this
reference
regarded
and
who
had
all
this
while
shifted
from
one
foot
to
another
with
great
impatience
a
hen
as
he
afterwards
said
a
het
girdle
and
chuckling
he
might
have
added
like
the
said
hen
in
all
the
glory
of
laying
an
egg
now
pushed
forward
i

from

pocket

as

inter

it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
the
worthy
baron
was
most
delighted
with
the
restitution
of
his
family
property
or
with
the
delicacy
and
generosity
that
left
him
unfettered
to
pursue
his
purpose
in
disposing
of
it
after
his
death
and
which
avoided
as
much
as
possible
even
the
appearance
of
laying
him
under
pecuniary
obligation
when
his
first
pause
of
joy
and
astonishment
was
over
his
thoughts
turned
to

the
baron
who
was
in
a
deep
reverie
starting
out
of
it
at
once
he
took
macwheeble
by
the
button
and
led
him
into
one
of
the
deep
window
recesses
whence
only
fragments
of
their
conversation
reached
the
rest
of
the
party
it
certainly
related
to
and
parchment
for
no
other
subject
even
from
the
mouth
of
his
patron
and

and
i
hae
it
ready
for
the
next
term
in
exchequer
their
private
conversation
ended
the
baron
was
now
summoned
to
do
the
honours
of
to
new
guests
these
were
major
melville
of
cairnvreckan
and
the
reverend
morton
followed
by
two
or
three
others
of
the
baron
acquaintances
who
had
been
made
privy
to
his
having
again
acquired
the
estate
of
his
fathers
the
shouts
of
the
villagers
were
also
heard
beneath
in
the
yard
for
saunders
saunderson
who
had
kept
the
secret
for
several
days
with
laudable
prudence
had
unloosed
his
tongue
upon
beholding
the
arrival
of
the
carriages
but
while
edward
received
major
melville
with
politeness
and
the
clergyman
with
the
most
affectionate
and
grateful
kindness
his
looked
a
little
awkward
as
uncertain
how
he
should
answer
the
necessary
claims
of
hospitality
to
his
guests
and
forward
the
festivity
of
his
tenants
lady
emily
relieved
him
by
intimating
that
though
she
must
be
an
indifferent
representative
of
edward
waverley
in
many
respects
she
hoped
the
baron
would
approve
of
the
entertainment
she
had
ordered
in
expectation
of
so
many
guests
and
that
they
would
find
such
other
accommodations
provided
as
might
in
some
degree
support
the
ancient
hospitality
of
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
pleasure
which
this
assurance
gave
the
baron
who
with
an
air
of
gallantry
half
appertaining
to
the
stiff
scottish
laird
and
half
to
the
officer
in
the
french
service
offered
his
arm
to
the
fair
speaker
and
led
the
way
in
something
between
a
stride
and
a
minuet
step
into
the
large
dining
parlour
followed
by
all
the
rest
of
the
good
company
by
dint
of
saunderson
directions
and
exertions
all
here
as
well
as
in
the
other
apartments
had
been
disposed
as
much
as
possible
according
to
the
old
arrangement
and
where
new
movables
had
been
necessary
they
had
been
selected
in
the
same
character
with
the
old
furniture
there
was
one
addition
to
this
fine
old
apartment
however
which
drew
tears
into
the
baron
eyes
it
was
a
large
and
spirited
painting
representing
fergus
and
waverley
in
their
highland
dress
the
scene
a
wild
rocky
and
mountainous
pass
down
which
the
clan
were
descending
in
the
background
it
was
taken
from
a
spirited
sketch
drawn
while
they
were
in
edinburgh
by
a
young
man
of
high
genius
and
had
been
painted
on
a
scale
by
an
eminent
london
artist
raeburn
himself
whose
chiefs
do
all
but
walk
out
of
the
canvas
could
not
have
done
more
justice
to
the
subject
and
the
ardent
fiery
and
impetuous
character
of
the
unfortunate
chief
of
glennaquoich
was
finely
contrasted
with
the
contemplative
fanciful
and
enthusiastic
expression
of
his
happier
friend
beside
this
painting
hung
the
arms
which
waverley
had
borne
in
the
unfortunate
civil
war
the
whole
piece
was
beheld
with
admiration
and
deeper
feelings
men
must
however
eat
in
spite
both
of
sentiment
and
vertu
and
the
baron
while
he
assumed
the
lower
end
of
the
table
insisted
that
lady
emily
should
do
the
honours
of
the
head
that
they
might
he
said
set
a
meet
example
to
the
young
folk
after
a
pause
of
deliberation
employed
in
adjusting
in
his
own
brain
the
precedence
between
the
presbyterian
kirk
and
episcopal
church
of
scotland
he
requested
morton
as
the
stranger
would
crave
a
blessing
observing
that
rubrick
who
was
at
home
would
return
thanks
for
the
distinguished
mercies
it
had
been
his
lot
to
experience
the
dinner
was
excellent
saunderson
attended
in
full
costume
with
all
the
former
domestics
who
had
been
collected
excepting
one
or
two
that
had
not
been
heard
of
since
the
affair
of
culloden
the
cellars
were
stocked
with
wine
which
was
pronounced
to
be
superb
and
it
had
been
contrived
that
the
bear
of
the
fountain
in
the
courtyard
should
for
that
night
only
play
excellent
brandy
punch
for
the
benefit
of
the
lower
orders
when
the
dinner
was
over
the
baron
about
to
propose
a
toast
cast
a
somewhat
sorrowful
look
upon
the
sideboard
which
however
exhibited
much
of
his
plate
that
had
either
been
secreted
or
purchased
by
neighbouring
gentlemen
from
the
soldiery
and
by
them
gladly
restored
to
the
original
owner
in
the
late
times
he
said
those
must
be
thankful
who
have
saved
life
and
land
yet
when
i
am
about
to
pronounce
this
toast
i
can
not
but
regret
an
old
heirloom
lady
emily
a
poculum
potatorium
colonel
talbot
here
the
baron
elbow
was
gently
touched
by
his
and
turning
round
he
beheld
in
the
hands
of
alexander
ab
alexandro
the
celebrated
cup
of
saint
duthac
the
blessed
bear
of
bradwardine
i
question
if
the
recovery
of
his
estate
afforded
him
more
rapture
by
my
honour
he
said
one
might
almost
believe
in
brownies
and
fairies
lady
emily
when
your
ladyship
is
in
presence
i
am
truly
happy
said
colonel
talbot
that
by
the
recovery
of
this
piece
of
family
antiquity
it
has
fallen
within
my
power
to
give
you
some
token
of
my
deep
interest
in
all
that
concerns
my
young
friend
edward
but
that
you
may
not
suspect
lady
emily
for
a
sorceress
or
me
for
a
conjuror
which
is
no
joke
in
scotland
i
must
tell
you
that
frank
stanley
your
friend
who
has
been
seized
with
a
tartan
fever
ever
since
he
heard
edward
tales
of
old
scottish
manners
happened
to
describe
to
us
at
this
remarkable
cup
my
servant
spontoon
who
like
a
true
old
soldier
observes
everything
and
says
little
gave
me
afterwards
to
understand
that
he
thought
he
had
seen
the
piece
of
plate
stanley
mentioned
in
the
possession
of
a
certain
nosebag
who
having
been
originally
the
helpmate
of
a
pawnbroker
had
found
opportunity
during
the
late
unpleasant
scenes
in
scotland
to
trade
a
little
in
her
old
line
and
so
became
the
depositary
of
the
more
valuable
part
of
the
spoil
of
half
the
army
you
may
believe
the
cup
was
speedily
recovered
and
it
will
give
me
very
great
pleasure
if
you
allow
me
to
suppose
that
its
value
is
not
diminished
by
having
been
restored
through
my
means
a
tear
mingled
with
the
wine
which
the
baron
filled
as
he
proposed
a
cup
of
gratitude
to
colonel
talbot
and
prosperity
of
the
united
houses
of
and
bradwardine
it
only
remains
for
me
to
say
that
as
no
wish
was
ever
uttered
with
more
affectionate
sincerity
there
are
few
which
allowing
for
the
necessary
mutability
of
human
events
have
been
upon
the
whole
more
happily
fulfilled
chapter
lxxii
a
postscript
which
should
have
been
a
preface
our
journey
is
now
finished
gentle
reader
and
if
your
patience
has
accompanied
me
through
these
sheets
the
contract
is
on
your
part
strictly
fulfilled
yet
like
the
driver
who
has
received
his
full
hire
i
still
linger
near
you
and
make
with
becoming
diffidence
a
trifling
additional
claim
upon
your
bounty
and
good
nature
you
are
as
free
however
to
shut
the
volume
of
the
one
petitioner
as
to
close
your
door
in
the
face
of
the
other
this
should
have
been
a
prefatory
chapter
but
for
two
reasons
first
that
most
novel
readers
as
my
own
conscience
reminds
me
are
apt
to
be
guilty
of
the
sin
of
omission
respecting
that
same
matter
of
prefaces
secondly
that
it
is
a
general
custom
with
that
class
of
students
to
begin
with
the
last
chapter
of
a
work
so
that
after
all
these
remarks
being
introduced
last
in
order
have
still
the
best
chance
to
be
read
in
their
proper
place
there
is
no
european
nation
which
within
the
course
of
half
a
century
or
little
more
has
undergone
so
complete
a
change
as
this
kingdom
of
scotland
the
effects
of
the
insurrection
of
the
destruction
of
the
patriarchal
power
of
the
highland
chiefs
the
abolition
of
the
heritable
jurisdictions
of
the
lowland
nobility
and
barons
the
total
eradication
of
the
jacobite
party
which
averse
to
intermingle
with
the
english
or
adopt
their
customs
long
continued
to
pride
themselves
upon
maintaining
ancient
scottish
manners
and
customs
commenced
this
innovation
the
gradual
influx
of
wealth
and
extension
of
commerce
have
since
united
to
render
the
present
people
of
scotland
a
class
of
beings
as
different
from
their
grandfathers
as
the
existing
english
are
from
those
of
queen
elizabeth
time
the
political
and
economical
effects
of
these
changes
have
been
traced
by
lord
selkirk
with
great
precision
and
accuracy
but
the
change
though
steadily
and
rapidly
progressive
has
nevertheless
been
gradual
and
like
those
who
drift
down
the
stream
of
a
deep
and
smooth
river
we
are
not
aware
of
the
progress
we
have
made
until
we
fix
our
eye
on
the
now
distant
point
from
which
we
have
been
drifted
such
of
the
present
generation
as
can
recollect
the
last
twenty
or
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
will
be
fully
sensible
of
the
truth
of
this
statement
especially
if
their
acquaintance
and
connexions
lay
among
those
who
in
my
younger
time
were
facetiously
called
of
the
old
leaven
who
still
cherished
a
lingering
though
hopeless
attachment
to
the
house
of
stuart
this
race
has
now
almost
entirely
vanished
from
the
land
and
with
it
doubtless
much
absurd
political
prejudice
but
also
many
living
examples
of
singular
and
disinterested
attachment
to
the
principles
of
loyalty
which
they
received
from
their
fathers
and
of
old
scottish
faith
hospitality
worth
and
honour
it
was
my
accidental
lot
though
not
born
a
highlander
which
may
be
an
apology
for
much
bad
gaelic
to
reside
during
my
childhood
and
youth
among
persons
of
the
above
description
and
now
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
some
idea
of
the
ancient
manners
of
which
i
have
witnessed
the
almost
total
extinction
i
have
embodied
in
imaginary
scenes
and
ascribed
to
fictitious
characters
a
part
of
the
incidents
which
i
then
received
from
those
who
were
actors
in
them
indeed
the
most
romantic
parts
of
this
narrative
are
precisely
those
which
have
a
foundation
in
fact
the
exchange
of
mutual
protection
between
a
highland
gentleman
and
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
king
service
together
with
the
spirited
manner
in
which
the
latter
asserted
his
right
to
return
the
favour
he
had
received
is
literally
true
the
accident
by
a
musket
shot
and
the
heroic
reply
imputed
to
flora
relate
to
a
lady
of
rank
not
long
deceased
and
scarce
a
gentleman
who
was
hiding
after
the
battle
of
culloden
but
could
tell
a
tale
of
strange
concealments
and
of
wild
and
as
extraordinary
as
any
which
i
have
ascribed
to
my
heroes
of
this
the
escape
of
charles
edward
himself
as
the
most
prominent
is
the
most
striking
example
the
accounts
of
the
battle
of
preston
and
skirmish
at
clifton
are
taken
from
the
narrative
of
intelligent
and
corrected
from
the
of
the
rebellion
by
the
late
venerable
author
of
the
lowland
scottish
gentlemen
and
the
subordinate
characters
are
not
given
as
individual
portraits
but
are
drawn
from
the
general
habits
of
the
period
of
which
i
have
witnessed
some
remnants
in
my
younger
days
and
partly
gathered
from
tradition
it
has
been
my
object
to
describe
these
persons
not
by
a
caricatured
and
exaggerated
use
of
the
national
dialect
but
by
their
habits
manners
and
feelings
so
as
in
some
distant
degree
to
emulate
the
admirable
irish
portraits
drawn
by
miss
edgeworth
so
different
from
the
and
joys
who
so
long
with
the
most
perfect
family
resemblance
to
each
other
occupied
the
drama
and
the
novel
i
feel
no
confidence
however
in
the
manner
in
which
i
have
executed
my
purpose
indeed
so
little
was
i
satisfied
with
my
production
that
i
laid
it
aside
in
an
unfinished
state
and
only
found
it
again
by
mere
accident
among
other
waste
papers
in
an
old
cabinet
the
drawers
of
which
i
was
rummaging
in
order
to
accommodate
a
friend
with
some
after
it
had
been
mislaid
for
several
years
two
works
upon
similar
subjects
by
female
authors
whose
genius
is
highly
creditable
to
their
country
have
appeared
in
the
interval
i
mean
hamilton
and
the
late
account
of
superstitions
but
the
first
is
confined
to
the
rural
habits
of
scotland
of
which
it
has
given
a
picture
with
striking
and
impressive
fidelity
and
the
traditional
records
of
the
respectable
and
ingenious
grant
of
laggan
are
of
a
nature
distinct
from
the
fictitious
narrative
which
i
have
here
attempted
i
would
willingly
persuade
myself
that
the
preceding
work
will
not
be
found
altogether
uninteresting
to
elder
persons
it
will
recall
scenes
and
characters
familiar
to
their
youth
and
to
the
rising
generation
the
tale
may
present
some
idea
of
the
manners
of
their
forefathers
yet
i
heartily
wish
that
the
task
of
tracing
the
evanescent
manners
of
his
own
country
had
employed
the
pen
of
the
only
man
in
scotland
who
could
have
done
it
justice
of
him
so
eminently
distinguished
in
elegant
literature
and
whose
sketches
of
colonel
caustic
and
umphraville
are
perfectly
blended
with
the
finer
traits
of
national
character
i
should
in
that
case
have
had
more
pleasure
as
a
reader
than
i
shall
ever
feel
in
the
pride
of
a
successful
author
should
these
sheets
confer
upon
me
that
envied
distinction
and
as
i
have
inverted
the
usual
arrangement
placing
these
remarks
at
the
end
of
the
work
to
which
they
refer
i
will
venture
on
a
second
violation
of
form
by
closing
the
whole
with
a
dedication
these
volumes
being
respectfully
inscribed
to
our
scottish

this

my
recollection
from
associations
which
have
been
long
and
painfully
broken
it
holds
a
commanding
station
on
the
banks
of
the
river

and
has
been
one
of
the
largest
castles
in
scotland
murdoch
duke
of

of
this
stately
pile
was
beheaded
on
the
of
stirling
from
which
he
might
see
the
towers
of
doune
the
monument
of
his
fallen
greatness
in
as
stated
in
the
text
a
garrison
on
the
part
of
the
chevalier
was
put
into
the
castle
then
less
ruinous
than
at
present
it
was
commanded
by
stewart
of
balloch
as
governor
for
prince
charles
he
was
a
man
of
property
near
callander
this
castle
became
at
that
time
the
actual
scene
of
a
romantic
escape
made
by
john
home
the
author
of
douglas
and
some
other
prisoners
who
having
been
taken
at
the
battle
of
falkirk
were
confined
there
by
the
insurgents
the
poet
who
had
in
his
own
mind
a
large
stock
of
that
romantic
and
enthusiastic
spirit
of
adventure
which
he
has
described
as
animating
the
youthful
hero
of
his
drama
devised
and
undertook
the
perilous
enterprise
of
escaping
from
his
prison
he
inspired
his
companions
with
his
sentiments
and
when
every
attempt
at
open
force
was
deemed
hopeless
they
resolved
to
twist
their
into
ropes
and
thus
to
descend
four
persons
with
home
himself
reached
the
ground
in
safety
but
the
rope
broke
with
the
fifth
who
was
a
tall
lusty
man
the
sixth
was
thomas
barrow
a
brave
young
englishman
a
particular
friend
of
home
determined
to
take
the
risk
even
in
such
unfavourable
circumstances
barrow
committed
himself
to
the
broken
rope
slid
down
on
it
as
far
as
it
could
assist
him
and
then
let
himself
drop
his
friends
beneath
succeeded
in
breaking
his
fall
nevertheless
he
dislocated
his
ankle
and
had
several
of
his
ribs
broken
his
companions
however
were
able
to
bear
him
off

safety

furiously
through

country
in
quest
of

fugitives
note
to
go
out
or
to
have
been
out
in
scotland
was
a
conventional
phrase
similar
to
that
of
the
irish
respecting
a
man
having
been
up
both
having
reference
to
an
individual
who
had
been
engaged
in
insurrection
it
was
accounted
in
scotland
about
forty
years
since
to
use
the
phrase
rebellion
or
rebel
which
might
be
interpreted
by
some
of
the
parties
present
as
a
personal
insult
it
was
also
esteemed
more
polite
even
for
stanch
whigs
to
denominate
charles
edward
the
chevalier
than
to
speak
of
him
as
the
pretender
and
this
kind
of
accommodating
courtesy
was
usually
observed
in
society
where
individuals
of
each
party
mixed
on
friendly
terms
note
the
jacobite
sentiments
were
general
among
the
western
counties
and
in
wales
but
although
the
great
families
of
the
wynnes
the
wyndhams
and
others
had
come
under
an
actual
obligation
to
join
prince
charles
if
he
should
land
they
had
done
so
under
the
express
stipulation
that
he
should
be
assisted
by
an
auxiliary
army
of
french
without
which
they
foresaw
the
enterprise
would
be
desperate
wishing
well
to
his
cause
therefore
and
watching
an
opportunity
to
join
him
they
did
not
nevertheless
think
themselves
bound
in
honour
to
do
so
as
he
was
only
supported
by
a
body
of
wild
mountaineers
speaking
an
uncouth
dialect
and
wearing
a
singular
dress
the
race
up
to
derby
struck
them
with
more
dread
than
admiration
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
the
effect
might
have
been
had
either
the
battle
of
preston
or
falkirk
been
fought
and
won
during
the
advance
into
england
note
divisions
early
showed
themselves
in
the
chevalier
little
army
not
only
amongst
the
independent
chieftains
who
were
far
too
proud
to
brook
subjection
to
each
other
but
betwixt
the
scotch
and
charles
governor
an
irishman
by
birth
who
with
some
of
his
countrymen
bred
in
the
irish
brigade
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
france
had
an
influence
with
the
adventurer
much
resented
by
the
highlanders
who
were
sensible
that
their
own
clans
made
the
chief
or
rather
the
only
strength
of
his
enterprise
there
was
a
feud
also
between
lord
george
murray
and
john
murray
of
broughton
the
prince
secretary
whose
disunion
greatly
embarrassed
the
affairs
of
the
adventurer
in
general
a
thousand
different
pretensions
divided
their
little
army
and
finally
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
its
overthrow
note
this
circumstance
which
is
historical
as
well
as
the
description
that
precedes
it
will
remind
the
reader
of
the
war
of
la
vendee
in
which
the
royalists
consisting
chiefly
of
insurgent
peasantry
attached
a
prodigious
and
even
superstitious
interest
to
the
possession
of
a
piece
of
brass
ordnance
which
they
called
marie
jeanne
the
highlanders
of
an
early
period
were
afraid
of
cannon
with
the
noise
and
effect
of
which
they
were
totally
unacquainted
it
was
by
means
of
three
or
four
small
pieces
of
artillery
that
the
earls
of
huntly
and
errol
in
james
vi
time
gained
a
great
victory
at
glenlivat
over
a
numerous
highland
army
commanded
by
the
earl
of
argyle
at
the
battle
of
the
bridge
of
dee
general
middleton
obtained
by
his
artillery
a
similar
success
the
highlanders
not
being
able
to
stand
the
discharge
of
musket
mother
which
was
the
name
they
bestowed
on
great
guns
in
an
old
ballad
on
the
battle
of
the
bridge
of
dee
these
verses
occur
the
highlandmen
are
pretty
men
for
handling
sword
and
shield
but
yet
they
are
but
simple
men
to
stand
a
stricken
field
the
highlandmen
are
pretty
men
for
target
and
claymore
but
yet
they
are
but
naked
men
to
face
the
cannon
roar
for
the
cannons
roar
on
a
summer
night
like
thunder
in
the
air
was
never
man
in
highland
garb
would
face
the
cannon
fair
but
the
highlanders
of
had
got
far
beyond
the
simplicity
of
their
forefathers
and
showed
throughout
the
whole
war
how
little
they
dreaded
artillery
although
the
common
people
still
attached
some
consequence
to
the
possession
of
the
which
led
to
this
disquisition
note
the
faithful
friend
who
pointed
out
the
pass
by
which
the
highlanders
moved
from
tranent
to
seaton
was
robert
anderson
junior
of
whitburgh
a
gentleman
of
property
in
east
lothian
he
had
been
interrogated
by
the
lord
george
murray
concerning
the
possibility
of
crossing
the
uncouth
and
marshy
piece
of
ground
which
divided
the
armies
and
which
he
described
as
impracticable
when
dismissed
he
recollected
that
there
was
a
circuitous
path
leading
eastward
through
the
marsh
into
the
plain
by
which
the
highlanders
might
turn
the
flank
of
sir
john
cope
position
without
being
exposed
to
the
enemy
fire
having
mentioned
his
opinion
to
hepburn
of
keith
who
instantly
saw
its
importance
he
was
encouraged
by
that
gentleman
to
awake
lord
george
murray
and
communicate
the
idea
to
him
lord
george
received
the
information
with
grateful
thanks
and
instantly
awakened
prince
charles
who
was
sleeping
in
the
field
with
a
bunch
of
pease
under
his
head
the
adventurer
received
with
alacrity
the
news
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
bringing
an
excellently
provided
army
to
a
decisive
battle
with
his
own
irregular
forces
his
joy
on
the
occasion
was
not
very
consistent
with
the
charge
of
cowardice
brought
against
him
by
chevalier
johnstone
a
discontented
follower
whose
memoirs
possess
at
least
as
much
of
a
romantic
as
a
historical
character
even
by
the
account
of
the
chevalier
himself
the
prince
was
at
the
head
of
the
second
line
of
the
highland
army
during
the
battle
of
which
he
says
was
gained
with
such
rapidity
that
in
the
second
line
where
i
was
still
by
the
side
of
the
prince
we
saw
no
other
enemy
than
those
who
were
lying
on
the
ground
killed
and
wounded
though
we
were
not
more
than
fifty
paces
behind
our
first
line
running
always
as
fast
as
we
could
to
overtake
them
this
passage
in
the
chevalier
memoirs
places
the
prince
within
fifty
paces
of
the
heat
of
the
battle
a
position
which
would
never
have
been
the
choice
of
one
unwilling
to
take
a
share
of
its
dangers
indeed
unless
the
chiefs
had
complied
with
the
young
adventurer
proposal
to
lead
the
van
in
person
it
does
not
appear
that
he
could
have
been
deeper
in
the
action
note
the
death
of
this
good
christian
and
gallant
man
is
thus
given
by
his
affectionate
biographer
doctor
doddridge
from
the
evidence
of
continued
all
night
under
arms
wrapped
up
in
his
cloak
and
generally
sheltered
under
a
rick
of
barley
which
happened
to
be
in
the
field
about
three
in
the
morning
he
called
his
domestic
servants
to
him
of
which
there
were
four
in
waiting
he
dismissed
three
of
them
with
most
affectionate
christian
advice
and
such
solemn
charges
relating
to
the
performance
of
their
duty
and
the
care
of
their
souls
as
seemed
plainly
to
intimate
that
he
apprehended
it
was
at
least
very
probable
he
was
taking
his
last
farewell
of
them
there
is
great
reason
to
believe
that
he
spent
the
little
remainder
of
the
time
which
could
not
be
much
above
an
hour
in
those
devout
exercises
of
soul
which
had
been
so
long
habitual
to
him
and
to
which
so
many
circumstances
did
then
concur
to
call
him
the
army
was
alarmed
by
break
of
day
by
the
noise
of
the
rebels
approach
and
the
attack
was
made
before
sunrise
yet
when
it
was
light
enough
to
discern
what
passed
as
soon
as
the
enemy
came
within
they
made
a
furious
fire
and
it
is
said
that
the
dragoons
which
constituted
the
left
wing
immediately
fled
the
colonel
at
the
beginning
of
the
onset
which
in
the
whole
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
received
a
wound
by
a
bullet
in
his
left
breast
which
made
him
give
a
sudden
spring
in
his
saddle
upon
which
his
servant
who
led
the
horse
would
have
persuaded
him
to
retreat
but
he
said
it
was
only
a
wound
in
the
flesh
and
fought
on
though
he
presently
after
received
a
shot
in
his
right
thigh
in
the
mean
time
it
was
discerned
that
some
of
the
enemy
fell
by
him
and
particularly
one
man
who
had
made
him
a
treacherous
visit
but
a
few
days
before
with
great
professions
of
zeal
for
the
present
establishment
of
this
kind
pass
in
less
time
than
the
description
of
them
can
be
written
or
than
it
can
be
read
the
colonel
was
for
a
few
moments
supported
by
his
men
and
particularly
by
that
worthy
person
whitney
who
was
shot
through
the
arm
here
and
a
few
months
after
fell
nobly
at
the
battle
of
falkirk
and
by
lieutenant
west
a
man
of
distinguished
bravery
as
also
by
about
fifteen
dragoons
who
stood
by
him
to
the
last
but
after
a
faint
fire
the
regiment
in
general
was
seized
with
a
panic
and
though
their
colonel
and
some
other
gallant
officers
did
what
they
could
to
rally
them
once
or
twice
they
at
last
took
a
precipitate
flight
and
just
in
the
moment
when
colonel
gardiner
seemed
to
be
making
a
pause
to
deliberate
what
duty
required
him
to
do
in
such
circumstances
an
accident
happened
which
must
i
think
in
the
judgment
of
every
worthy
and
generous
man
be
allowed
a
sufficient
apology
for
exposing
his
life
to
so
great
hazard
when
his
regiment
had
left
him
he
saw
a
party
of
the
foot
who
were
then
bravely
fighting
near
him
and
whom
he
was
ordered
to
support
had
no
officer
to
head
them
upon
which
he
said
eagerly
in
the
hearing
of
the
person
from
whom
i
had
this
account
these
brave
fellows
will
be
cut
to
pieces
for
want
of
a
commander
or
words
to
that
effect
which
while
he
was
speaking
he
rode
up
to
them
and
cried
out
fire
on
my
lads
and
fear
nothing
but
just
as
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
a
highlander
advanced
towards
him
with
a
scythe
fastened
to
a
long
pole
with
which
he
gave
him
so
dreadful
a
wound
on
his
right
arm
that
his
sword
dropped
out
of
his
hand
and
at
the
same
time
several
others
coming
about
him
while
he
was
thus
dreadfully
entangled
with
that
cruel
weapon
he
was
dragged
off
from
his
horse
the
moment
he
fell
another
highlander
who
if
the
king
evidence
at
carlisle
may
be
credited
as
i
know
not
why
they
should
not
though
the
unhappy
creature
died
denying
it
was
one
who
was
executed
about
a
year
after
gave
him
a
stroke
either
with
a
broadsword
or
a
for
my
informant
could
not
exactly
distinguish
on
the
hinder
part
of
his
head
which
was
the
mortal
blow
all
that
his
faithful
attendant
saw
farther
at
this
time
was
that
as
his
hat
was
fallen
off
he
took
it
in
his
left
hand
and
waved
it
as
a
signal
to
him
to
retreat
and
added
what
were
the
last
words
he
ever
heard
him
speak
take
care
of
yourself
upon
which
the
servant
retired
some
remarkable
passages
in
the
life
of
colonel
james
gardiner
by
doddridge
london
i
may
remark
on
this
extract
that
it
confirms
the
account
given
in
the
text
of
the
resistance
offered
by
some
of
the
english
infantry
surprised
by
a
force
of
a
peculiar
and
unusual
description
their
opposition
could
not
be
long
or
formidable
especially
as
they
were
deserted
by
the
cavalry
and
those
who
undertook
to
manage
the
artillery
but
although
the
affair
was
soon
decided
i
have
always
understood
that
many
of
the
infantry
showed
an
inclination
to
do
their
duty
note
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
the
character
of
this
brutal
young
laird
is
entirely
imaginary
a
gentleman
however
who
resembled
balmawhapple
in
the
article
of
courage
only
fell
at
preston
in
the
manner
described
a
perthshire
gentleman
of
high
honour
and
respectability
one
of
the
handful
of
cavalry
who
followed
the
fortunes
of
charles
edward
pursued
the
fugitive
dragoons
almost
alone
till
near
saint
clement
wells
where
the
efforts
of
some
of
the
officers
had
prevailed
on
a
few
of
them
to
make
a
momentary
stand
perceiving
at
this
moment
that
they
were
pursued
by
only
one
man
and
a
couple
of
servants
they
turned
upon
him
and
cut
him
down
with
their
swords
i
remember
when
a
child
sitting
on
his
grave
where
the
grass
long
grew
rank
and
green
distinguishing
it
from
the
rest
of
the
field
a
female
of
the
family
then
residing
at
saint
clement
wells
used
to
tell
me
the
tragedy
of
which
she
had
been
an
and
showed
me
in
evidence

of
the
silver
clasps
of
the
unfortunate

name
of

inscribed
on

this

were
his

and
when
he
flourished
have
hitherto
defied
the
research
of
antiquaries
only
it
is
in
general
believed
that
andrea
de
ferrara
was
a
spanish
or
italian
artificer
brought
over
by
james
iv
or
v
to
instruct
the
scots
in
the
manufacture
of
sword
blades
most
barbarous
nations
excel
in
the
fabrication
of
arms
and
the
scots
had
attained
great
proficiency
in
forging
swords
so
early
as
the
field
of
pinkie
at
which
period
the
historian
patten
describes
them
as
notably
broad
and
thin
universally
made
to
slice
and
of
such
exceeding
good
temper
that
as
i
never
saw
any
so
good
so
i
think
it
hard
to
devise
better
account
of
somerset
expedition

may
be
observed
that
the
best

most
genuine

note
the
author
of
waverley
has
been
charged
with
painting
the
young
adventurer
in
colours
more
amiable
than
his
character
deserved
but
having
known
many
individuals
who
were
near
his
person
he
has
been
described
according
to
the
light
in
which
those
saw
his
temper
and
qualifications
something
must
be
allowed
no
doubt
to
the
natural
exaggerations
of
those
who
remembered
him
as
the
bold
and
adventurous
prince
in
whose
cause
they
had
braved
death
and
ruin
but
is
their
evidence
to
give
place
entirely
to
that
of
a
single
malcontent
i
have
already
noticed
the
imputations
thrown
by
the
chevalier
johnstone
on
the
prince
courage
but
some
part
at
least
of
that
gentleman
tale
is
purely
romantic
it
would
not
for
instance
be
supposed
that
at
the
time
he
is
favouring
us
with
the
highly
wrought
account
of
his
amour
with
the
adorable
peggie
the
chevalier
johnstone
was
a
married
man
whose
grandchild
is
now
alive
or
that
the
whole
circumstantial
story
concerning
the
outrageous
vengeance
taken
by
gordon
of
abbachie
on
a
presbyterian
clergyman
is
entirely
apocryphal
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
admitted
that
the
prince
like
others
of
his
family
did
not
esteem
the
services
done
him
by
his
adherents
so
highly
as
he
ought
educated
in
high
ideas
of
his
hereditary
right
he
has
been
supposed
to
have
held
every
exertion
and
sacrifice
made
in
his
cause
as
too
much
the
duty
of
the
person
making
it
to
merit
extravagant
gratitude
on
his
part
king
evidence
which
his
leaving
the
jacobite
interest
renders
somewhat
doubtful
goes
to
strengthen
this
opinion
the
ingenious
editor
of
johnstone
memoirs
has
quoted
a
story
said
to
be
told
by
helvetius
stating
that
prince
charles
edward
far
from
voluntarily
embarking
on
his
daring
expedition
was
literally
bound
hand
and
foot
and
to
which
he
seems
disposed
to
yield
credit
now
it
being
a
fact
as
well
known
as
any
in
his
history
and
so
far
as
i
know
entirely
undisputed
that
the
prince
personal
entreaties
and
urgency
positively
forced
boisdale
and
lochiel
into
insurrection
when
they
were
earnestly
desirous
that
he
would
put
off
his
attempt
until
he
could
obtain
a
sufficient
force
from
france
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
reconcile
his
alleged
reluctance
to
undertake
the
expedition
with
his
desperately
insisting
upon
carrying
the
rising
into
effect
against
the
advice
and
entreaty
of
his
most
powerful
and
most
sage
partizans
surely
a
man
who
had
been
carried
bound
on
board
the
vessel
which
brought
him
to
so
desperate
an
enterprise
would
have
taken
the
opportunity
afforded
by
the
reluctance
of
his
partizans
to
return
to
france
in
safety
it
is
averred
in
johnstone
memoirs
that
charles
edward
left
the
field
of
culloden
without
doing
the
utmost
to
dispute
the
victory
and
to
give
the
evidence
on
both
sides
there
is
in
existence
the
more
trustworthy
testimony
of
lord
elcho
who
states
that
he
himself
earnestly
exhorted
the
prince
to
charge
at
the
head
of
the
left
wing
which
was
entire
and
retrieve
the
day
or
die
with
honour
and
on
his
counsel
being
declined
lord
elcho
took
leave
of
him
with
a
bitter
execration
swearing
he
would
never
look
on
his
face
again
and
kept
his
word
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
to
have
been
the
opinion
of
almost
all
the
other
officers
that
the
day
was
irretrievably
lost
one
wing
of
the
highlanders
being
entirely
routed
the
rest
of
the
army
outnumbered
outflanked
and
in
a
condition
totally
hopeless
in
this
situation
of
things
the
irish
officers
who
surrounded
charles
person
interfered
to
force
him
off
the
field
a
cornet
who
was
close
to
the
prince
left
a
strong
attestation
that
he
had
seen
sir
thomas
sheridan
seize
the
bridle
of
his
horse
and
turn
him
round
there
is
some
discrepancy
of
evidence
but
the
opinion
of
lord
elcho
a
man
of
fiery
temper
and
desperate
at
the
ruin
which
he
beheld
impending
can
not
fairly
be
taken
in
prejudice
of
a
character
for
courage
which
is
intimated
by
the
nature
of
the
enterprise
itself
by
the
prince
eagerness
to
fight
on
all
occasions
by
his
determination
to
advance
from
derby
to
london
and
by
the
presence
of
mind
which
he
manifested
during
the
romantic
perils
of
his
escape
the
author
is
far
from
claiming
for
this
unfortunate
person
the
praise
due
to
splendid
talents
but
he
continues
to
be
of
opinion
that
at
the
period
of
his
enterprise
he
had
a
mind
capable
of
facing
danger
and
aspiring
to
fame
that
charles
edward
had
the
advantages
of
a
graceful
presence
courtesy
and
an
address
and
manner
becoming
his
station
the
author
never
heard
disputed
by
any
who
approached
his
person
nor
does
he
conceive
that
these
qualities
are
overcharged
in
the
present
attempt
to
sketch
his
portrait
the
following
extracts
corroborative
of
the
general
opinion
respecting
the
prince
amiable
disposition
are
taken
from
a
manuscript
account
of
his
romantic
expedition
by
james
maxwell
of
kirkconnell
of
which
i
possess
a
copy
by
the
friendship
of
menzies
of
pitfoddells
the
author
though
partial
to
the
prince
whom
he
faithfully
followed
seems
to
have
been
a
fair
and
candid
man
and
well
acquainted
with
the
intrigues
among
the
adventurer
council
was
mightily
taken
with
the
prince
figure
and
personal
behaviour
there
was
but
one
voice
about
them
those
whom
interest
or
prejudice
made
a
runaway
to
his
cause
could
not
help
acknowledging
that
they
wished
him
well
in
all
other
respects
and
could
hardly
blame
him
for
his
present
undertaking
sundry
things
had
concurred
to
raise
his
character
to
the
highest
pitch
besides
the
greatness
of
the
enterprise
and
the
conduct
that
had
hitherto
appeared
in
the
execution
of
it
were
several
instances
of
good
nature
and
humanity
that
had
made
a
great
impression
on
people
minds
i
shall
confine
myself
to
two
or
three
after
the
battle
as
the
prince
was
riding
along
the
ground
that
cope
army
had
occupied
a
few
minutes
before
one
of
the
officers
came
up
to
congratulate
him
and
said
pointing
to
the
killed
sir
there
are
your
enemies
at
your
feet
the
prince
far
from
exulting
expressed
a
great
deal
of
compassion
for
his
father
deluded
subjects
whom
he
declared
he
was
heartily
sorry
to
see
in
that
posture
day
while
the
prince
was
at
pinkie
house
a
citizen
of
edinburgh
came
to
make
some
representation
to
secretary
murray
about
the
tents
that
city
was
ordered
to
furnish
against
a
certain
day
murray
happened
to
be
out
of
the
way
which
the
prince
hearing
of
called
to
have
the
gentleman
brought
to
him
saying
he
would
rather
despatch
the
business
whatever
it
was
himself
than
have
the
gentleman
wait
which
he
did
by
granting
everything
that
was
asked
so
much
affability
in
a
young
prince
flushed
with
victory
drew
encomiums
even
from
his
enemies
what
gave
the
people
the
highest
idea
of
him
was
the
negative
he
gave
to
a
thing
that
very
nearly
concerned
his
interest
and
upon
which
the
success
of
his
enterprise
perhaps
depended
it
was
proposed
to
send
one
of
the
prisoners
to
london
to
demand
of
that
court
a
cartel
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
taken
and
to
be
taken
during
this
war
and
to
intimate
that
a
refusal
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
resolution
on
their
part
to
give
no
quarter
it
was
visible
a
cartel
would
be
of
great
advantage
to
the
affairs
his
friends
would
be
more
ready
to
declare
for
him
if
they
had
nothing
to
fear
but
the
chance
of
war
in
the
field
and
if
the
court
of
london
refused
to
settle
a
cartel
the
prince
was
authorised
to
treat
his
prisoners
in
the
same
manner
the
elector
of
hanover
was
determined
to
treat
such
of
the
prince
friends
as
might
fall
into
his
hands
it
was
urged
that
a
few
examples
would
compel
the
court
of
london
to
comply
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
the
officers
of
the
english
army
would
make
a
point
of
it
they
had
never
engaged
in
the
service
but
upon
such
terms
as
are
in
use
among
all
civilised
nations
and
it
could
be
no
stain
upon
their
honour
to
lay
down
their
commissions
if
these
terms
were
not
observed
and
that
owing
to
the
obstinacy
of
their
own
prince
though
this
scheme
was
plausible
and
represented
as
very
important
the
prince
could
never
be
brought
into
it
it
was
below
him
he
said
to
make
empty
threats
and
he
would
never
put
such
as
those
into
execution
he
would
never
in
cold
blood
take
away
lives
which
he
had
saved
in
heat
of
action
at
the
peril
of
his
own
these
were
not
the
only
proofs
of
good
nature
the
prince
gave
about
this
time
every
day
produced
something
new
of
this
kind
these
things
softened
the
rigour
of
a
military
government
which
was
only
imputed
to
the
necessity
of
his
affairs
and
which
he
endeavoured
to
make
as
gentle
and
easy
as
possible
it
has
been
said
that
the
prince
sometimes
exacted
more
state
and
ceremonial
than
seemed
to
suit
his
condition
but
on
the
other
hand
some
strictness
of
etiquette
was
altogether
indispensable
where
he
must
otherwise
have
been
exposed
to
general
intrusion
he
could
also
endure
with
a
good
grace
the
retorts
which
his
affectation
of
ceremony
sometimes
exposed
him
to
it
is
said
for
example
that
grant
of
glenmoriston
having
made
a
hasty
march
to
join
charles
at
the
head
of
his
clan
rushed
into
the
presence
at
holyrood
with
unceremonious
haste
without
having
attended
to
the
duties
of
the
toilet
the
prince
received
him
kindly
but
not
without
a
hint
that
a
previous
interview
with
the
barber
might
not
have
been
wholly
unnecessary
is
not
beardless
boys
answered
the
displeased
chief
are
to
do
your
royal
highness
turn
the
chevalier
took
the
rebuke
in
good
part
on
the
whole
if
prince
charles
had
concluded
his
life
soon
after
his
miraculous
escape
his
character
in
history
must
have
stood
very
high
as
it
was
his
station
is
amongst
those
a
certain
brilliant
portion
of
whose
life
forms
a
remarkable
contrast
to
all
which
precedes
and
all
which
follows
it
note
the
following
account
of
the
skirmish
at
clifton
is
extracted
from
the
manuscript
memoirs
of
evan
macpherson
of
cluny
chief
of
the
clan
macpherson
who
had
the
merit
of
supporting
the
principal
brunt
of
that
spirited
affair
the
memoirs
appear
to
have
been
composed
about
only
ten
years
after
the
action
had
taken
place
they
were
written
in
france
where
that
gallant
chief
resided
in
exile
which
accounts
for
some
gallicisms
which
occur
in
the
narrative
the
prince
return
from
derby
back
towards
scotland
my
lord
george
murray
cheerfully
charg
himself
with
the
command
of
the
rear
a
post
which
altho
honourable
was
attended
with
great
danger
many
difficulties
and
no
small
fatigue
for
the
prince
being
apprehensive
that
his
retreat
to
scotland
might
be
cut
off
by
marischall
wade
who
lay
to
the
northward
of
him
with
an
armie
much
supperior
to
what
had
while
the
duke
of
comberland
with
his
whole
cavalrie
followed
hard
in
the
rear
was
obliged
to
hasten
his
marches
it
was
not
therefore
possible
for
the
artilirie
to
march
so
fast
as
the
prince
army
in
the
depth
of
winter
extremely
bad
weather
and
the
worst
roads
in
england
so
lord
george
murray
was
obliged
often
to
continue
his
marches
long
after
it
was
dark
almost
every
night
while
at
the
same
time
he
had
frequent
allarms
and
disturbances
from
the
duke
of
comberland
advanc
parties
the
evening
of
the
december
the
prince
entered
the
town
of
penrith
in
the
province
of
comberland
but
as
lord
george
murray
could
not
bring
up
the
artilirie
so
fast
as
he
wou
have
wish
he
was
oblig
to
pass
the
night
six
miles
short
of
that
town
together
with
the
regiment
of
macdonel
of
glengarrie
which
that
day
happened
to
have
the
arrear
guard
the
prince
in
order
to
refresh
his
armie
and
to
give
my
lord
george
and
the
artilirie
time
to
come
up
resolved
to
sejour
the
at
penrith
so
ordered
his
little
army
to
appear
in
the
morning
under
arms
in
order
to
be
reviewed
and
to
know
in
what
manner
the
numbers
stood
from
his
haveing
entered
england
it
did
not
at
that
time
amount
to
foot
in
all
with
about
cavalrie
of
the
noblesse
who
serv
as
volunteers
part
of
whom
form
a
first
troop
of
guards
for
the
prince
under
the
command
of
my
lord
elchoe
now
comte
de
weems
who
being
proscribed
is
presently
in
france
another
part
formed
a
second
troup
of
guards
under
the
command
of
my
lord
balmirino
who
was
beheaded
at
the
tower
of
london
a
third
part
serv
under
my
lord
le
comte
de
kilmarnock
who
was
likewise
beheaded
at
the
tower
a
fourth
part
serv
under
my
lord
pitsligow
who
is
also
proscribed
which
cavalrie
very
few
in
numbers
being
all
noblesse
were
very
brave
and
of
infinite
advantage
to
the
foot
not
only
in
the
day
of
battle
but
in
serving
as
advanced
guards
on
the
several
marches
and
in
patroling
dureing
the
night
on
the
different
roads
which
led
towards
the
towns
where
the
army
happened
to
quarter
this
small
army
was
out
in
a
body
on
the
december
upon
a
riseing
ground
to
the
northward
of
penrith
passing
review
mons
de
cluny
with
his
tribe
was
ordered
to
the
bridge
of
clifton
about
a
mile
to
southward
of
penrith
after
having
in
review
before
mons
pattullo
who
was
charged
with
the
inspection
of
the
troops
and
was
likeways
of
the
army
and
is
now
in
france
they
remained
under
arms
at
the
bridge
waiting
the
arrival
of
my
lord
george
murray
with
the
artilirie
whom
mons
de
cluny
had
orders
to
cover
in
passing
the
bridge
they
arrived
about
sunsett
closly
pursued
by
the
duke
of
comberland
with
the
whole
body
of
his
cavalrie
reckoned
upwards
of
strong
about
a
thousand
of
whom
as
near
as
might
be
computed
dismounted
in
order
to
cut
off
the
passage
of
the
artilirie
towards
the
bridge
while
the
duke
and
the
others
remained
on
horseback
in
order
to
attack
the
rear
lord
george
murray
advanced
and
although
he
found
mons
de
cluny
and
his
tribe
in
good
spirits
under
arms
yet
the
circumstance
appear
extremely
delicate
the
numbers
were
vastly
unequall
and
the
attack
seem
very
dangerous
so
my
lord
george
declin
giving
orders
to
such
time
as
he
ask
mons
de
oppinion
i
will
attack
them
with
all
my
heart
says
mons
de
cluny
if
you
order
me
i
do
order
it
then
answered
my
lord
george
and
immediately
went
on
himself
along
with
mons
de
cluny
and
fought
sword
in
hand
on
foot
at
the
head
of
the
single
tribe
of
macphersons
they
in
a
moment
made
their
way
through
a
strong
hedge
of
thorns
under
the
cover
whereof
the
cavalrie
had
taken
their
station
in
the
strugle
of
passing
which
hedge
my
lord
george
murray
being
dressed
en
montagnard
as
all
the
army
were
lost
his
bonet
and
wig
so
continued
to
fight
during
the
action
they
at
first
made
a
brisk
discharge
of
their
firearms
on
the
enemy
then
attacked
them
with
their
sabres
and
made
a
great
slaughter
a
considerable
time
which
obliged
comberland
and
his
cavalrie
to
fly
with
precipitation
and
in
great
confusion
in
so
much
that
if
the
prince
had
been
provided
in
a
sufficient
number
of
cavalrie
to
have
taken
advantage
of
the
disorder
it
is
beyond
question
that
the
duke
of
comberland
and
the
bulk
of
his
cavalrie
had
been
taken
prisoners
this
time
it
was
so
dark
that
it
was
not
possible
to
view
or
number
the
slain
who
filled
all
the
ditches
which
happened
to
be
on
the
ground
where
they
stood
but
it
was
computed
that
besides
those
who
went
off
wounded
upwards
of
a
hundred
at
least
were
left
on
the
spot
among
whom
was
colonel
honywood
who
commanded
the
dismounted
cavalrie
whose
sabre
of
considerable
value
mons
de
cluny
brought
off
and
still
preserves
and
his
tribe
lykeways
brought
off
many
arms
the
colonel
was
afterwards
taken
up
and
his
wounds
being
dress
with
great
difficultie
recovered
mons
de
cluny
lost
only
in
the
action
twelve
men
of
whom
some
haveing
been
only
wounded
fell
afterwards
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
were
sent
as
slaves
to
america
whence
several
of
them
returned
and
one
of
them
is
now
in
france
a
sergeant
in
the
regiment
of
royal
scots
how
soon
the
accounts
of
the
enemies
approach
had
reached
the
prince
had
immediately
ordered
le
comte
de
nairne
brigadier
who
being
proscribed
is
now
in
france
with
the
three
batalions
of
the
duke
of
athol
the
batalion
of
the
duke
of
perth
and
some
other
troups
under
his
command
in
order
to
support
cluny
and
to
bring
off
the
artilirie
but
the
action
was
entirely
over
before
the
comte
de
nairne
with
his
command
cou
reach
nigh
to
the
place
they
therefore
return
all
to
penrith
and
the
artilirie
marched
up
in
good
order
did
the
duke
of
comberland
ever
afterwards
dare
to
come
within
a
day
march
of
the
prince
and
his
army
dureing
the
course
of
all
that
retreat
which
was
conducted
with
great
prudence
and
safety
when
in
some
manner
surrounded
by
enemies
note
as
the
heathen
deities
contracted
an
indelible
obligation
if
they
swore
by
styx
the
scottish
highlanders
had
usually
some
peculiar
solemnity
attached
to
an
oath
which
they
intended
should
be
binding
on
them
very
frequently
it
consisted
in
laying
their
hand
as
they
swore
on
their
own
drawn
dirk
which
dagger
becoming
a
party
to
the
transaction
was
invoked
to
punish
any
breach
of
faith
but
by
whatever
ritual
the
oath
was
sanctioned
the
party
was
extremely
desirous
to
keep
secret
what
the
especial
oath
was
which
he
considered
as
irrevocable
this
was
a
matter
of
great
convenience
as
he
felt
no
scruple
in
breaking
his
asseveration
when
made
in
any
other
form
than
that
which
he
accounted
as
peculiarly
solemn
and
therefore
readily
granted
any
engagement
which
bound
him
no
longer
than
he
inclined
whereas
if
the
oath
which
he
accounted
inviolable
was
once
publicly
known
no
party
with
whom
he
might
have
occasion
to
contract
would
have
rested
satisfied
with
any
other
louis
xi
of
france
practised
the
same
sophistry
for
he
also
had
a
peculiar
species
of
oath
the
only
one
which
he
was
ever
known
to
respect
and
which
therefore
he
was
very
unwilling
to
pledge
the
only
engagement
which
that
wily
tyrant
accounted
binding
upon
him
was
an
oath
by
the
holy
cross
of
saint
lo
which
contained
a
portion
of
the
true
cross
if
he
prevaricated
after
taking
this
oath
louis
believed
he
should
die
within
the
year
the
constable
saint
paul
being
invited
to
a
personal
conference
with
louis
refused
to
meet
the
king
unless
he
would
agree
to
ensure
him
safe
conduct
under
sanction
of
this
oath
but
says
comines
the
king
replied
he
would
never
again
pledge
that
engagement
to
mortal
man
though
he
was
willing
to
