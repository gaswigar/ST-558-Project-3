the
machine
way
we
feel
about
another
person
or
about
objects
is
often
bound
up
in
associations
that
have
no
direct
connection
with
the
person
or
object
at
all
often
what
we
call
a
change
of
heart
comes
about
sheerly
from
a
change
in
the
many
associations
which
make
up
our
present
viewpoint
now
suppose
that
these
associations
could
be
altered
artificially
at
the
option
of
the
person
who
was
in
charge
of
the
process
poul
anderson
she
was
years
old
fresh
out
of
college
full
of
life
and
hope
and
all
set
to
conquer
the
world
colin
fraser
happened
to
be
on
vacation
on
cape
cod
where
she
was
playing
summer
stock
and
went
to
more
shows
than
he
had
planned
it
was
hard
to
get
an
introduction
and
before
long
he
and
judy
sanders
were
seeing
a
lot
of
each
other
of
course
she
told
him
one
afternoon
on
the
beach
my
real
name
is
harkness
he
raised
his
arm
letting
the
sand
run
through
his
fingers
the
beach
was
big
and
dazzling
white
around
them
the
sea
galloped
in
with
a
steady
roar
and
a
gull
rode
the
breeze
overhead
what
was
wrong
with
it
he
asked
for
a
professional
monicker
i
mean
she
laughed
and
shook
the
long
hair
back
over
her
shoulders
i
wanted
to
live
under
the
name
of
sanders
she
explained
oh
oh
yes
of
course
winnie
the
pooh
he
grinned
soulmates
that
what
we
are
it
was
about
then
that
he
decided
he
been
a
bachelor
long
enough
in
the
fall
she
went
to
new
york
to
begin
the
upward
grind
understudy
parts
and
roles
in
outright
turkeys
fraser
returned
to
boston
for
awhile
but
his
work
suffered
he
had
to
keep
dashing
off
to
see
her
by
spring
she
was
beginning
to
get
places
she
had
talent
and
everybody
enjoys
looking
at
a
blonde
his
weekly
proposals
were
also
beginning
to
show
some
real
progress
and
he
thought
that
a
month
or
two
of
steady
siege
might
finish
the
campaign
so
he
took
leave
from
his
job
and
went
down
to
new
york
himself
he
saved
up
enough
money
and
was
good
enough
in
his
work
to
afford
it
anyway
he
was
his
own
boss
consulting
engineer
specializing
in
mathematical
analysis
he
got
a
furnished
room
in
brooklyn
and
filled
in
his
leisure
time
as
he
thought
of
it
with
some
special
math
courses
at
columbia
and
he
had
a
lot
of
friends
in
town
in
a
curious
variety
of
professions
next
to
judy
he
saw
most
of
the
physicist
sworsky
who
was
an
entertaining
companion
though
most
of
his
work
was
too
even
to
be
mentioned
it
was
a
happy
period
there
is
always
a
jarring
note
to
be
sure
in
this
case
it
was
the
fact
that
fraser
had
plenty
of
competition
he
was
himself
a
tall
gaunt
man
of
with
a
dark
hatchet
face
and
clothes
but
still
judy
saw
more
of
him
than
of
anyone
else
and
admitted
she
was
seriously
considering
his
proposal
and
no
other
he
called
her
up
once
for
a
date
sorry
she
answered
i
love
to
colin
but
i
already
promised
tonight
just
so
you
wo
worry
matthew
snyder
hm
the
industrialist
he
asked
me
in
such
a
way
it
was
hard
to
refuse
but
i
think
you
have
to
be
jealous
honey
now
fraser
lit
his
pipe
with
a
certain
smugness
snyder
was
several
times
a
millionaire
but
he
was
close
to
sixty
a
widower
of
notably
dull
conversation
judy
was
well
no
worries
as
she
said
he
dropped
over
to
sworsky
apartment
for
an
evening
of
chess
and
it
was
early
in
may
when
the
world
was
turning
green
again
that
judy
called
fraser
up
hi
she
said
breathlessly
busy
tonight
well
i
was
hoping
i
be
if
you
get
what
i
mean
he
said
look
i
want
to
take
you
out
for
a
change
just
got
some
unexpected
money
and
dammit
i
want
to
feel
rich
for
one
evening
hmmm
he
scowled
into
the
phone
i
dunno
oh
get
off
it
galahad
i
meet
you
in
the
dixie
lobby
at
seven
okay
she
blew
him
a
kiss
over
the
wires
and
hung
up
before
he
could
argue
further
he
sighed
and
shrugged
why
not
if
she
wanted
to
they
were
in
a
little
hungarian
restaurant
with
a
couple
of
tzigani
strolling
about
playing
for
them
alone
it
seemed
when
he
asked
for
details
did
you
get
a
bonus
or
what
no
she
laughed
at
him
over
her
drink
i
turned
guinea
pig
i
hope
you
quit
job
before
we
married
it
a
funny
deal
she
said
thoughtfully
it
interest
you
been
out
a
couple
of
times
with
this
snyder
you
know
and
if
anything
was
needed
to
drive
me
into
your
arms
colin
it
his
political
lectures
well
bless
the
republican
party
he
laid
his
hand
over
hers
she
did
withdraw
it
but
she
frowned
just
a
little
colin
you
know
i
want
to
get
somewhere
before
i
marry
see
a
bit
of
the
world
the
theatrical
world
before
turning
hausfrau
do
be
so
oh
never
mind
i
like
you
anyway
sipping
her
drink
and
setting
it
down
again
well
to
carry
on
with
the
story
i
finally
gave
comrade
snyder
the
complete
and
i
must
say
he
took
it
very
nicely
but
today
this
morning
he
called
asking
me
to
have
lunch
with
him
and
i
did
after
he
explained
it
seems
he
got
a
psychiatrist
friend
doing
research
measuring
brain
storms
or
something
and
do
i
mean
storms
waves
i
guess
anyway
he
wants
to
measure
as
many
different
kinds
of
people
as
possible
and
snyder
had
suggested
me
i
was
supposed
to
come
in
for
three
afternoons
running
about
two
hours
each
time
and
i
get
a
hundred
dollars
per
session
hm
said
fraser
i
did
know
psych
research
was
that
who
is
this
mad
scientist
his
name
is
kennedy
oh
by
the
way
i
not
supposed
to
tell
anybody
they
want
to
spring
it
on
the
world
as
a
surprise
or
something
but
you
different
colin
i
excited
i
want
to
talk
to
somebody
about
it
sure
he
said
you
had
a
session
already
yes
my
first
was
today
it
a
funny
place
to
do
research
got
a
big
suite
on
fifth
avenue
right
up
in
the
classy
district
beautiful
office
the
name
of
his
outfit
is
sentiment
hm
why
should
a
take
such
a
name
well
go
on
oh
there
is
much
else
to
tell
kennedy
was
very
nice
he
took
me
into
a
laboratory
full
of
all
sorts
of
dials
and
meters
and
blinking
lights
and
os
what
do
you
call
them
those
things
that
make
wiggly
pictures
oscilloscopes
you
never
make
a
scientist
my
dear
she
grinned
but
i
know
one
scientist
who
like
to
never
mind
anyway
he
sat
me
down
in
a
chair
and
put
bands
around
my
wrists
and
ankles
just
like
the
hot
squat
and
a
big
thing
like
a
over
my
head
then
he
fiddled
with
his
dials
for
awhile
making
notes
then
he
started
saying
words
at
me
and
showing
me
pictures
some
of
them
were
very
pretty
some
ugly
some
funny
some
downright
horrible
anyway
that
all
there
was
to
it
after
a
couple
of
hours
he
gave
me
a
check
for
a
hundred
dollars
and
told
me
to
come
back
tomorrow
hm
fraser
rubbed
his
chin
apparently
he
was
measuring
the
electric
rhythms
corresponding
to
pleasure
and
dislike
i
no
idea
made
an
encephalograph
that
accurate
well
said
judy
i
told
you
why
we
celebrating
now
come
on
the
regular
orchestra
tuning
up
let
dance
they
had
a
rather
wonderful
evening
afterward
fraser
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
not
wanting
to
lose
a
state
of
happiness
in
sleep
he
considered
sleep
a
hideous
waste
of
time
if
he
lived
to
be
ninety
have
spent
almost
thirty
years
unconscious
judy
was
engaged
for
the
next
couple
of
evenings
and
fraser
himself
was
invited
to
dinner
at
sworsky
the
night
after
that
so
it
was
till
the
end
of
the
week
that
he
called
her
again
hullo
sweetheart
he
said
exuberantly
how
things
i
refer
to
charles
addams
things
of
course
oh
colin
her
voice
was
very
small
and
it
trembled
look
i
got
two
tickets
to
so
put
on
your
own
pinafore
and
meet
me
colin
i
sorry
colin
i
ca
huh
he
noticed
how
odd
she
sounded
and
a
leadenness
grew
within
him
you
are
sick
are
you
colin
i
i
going
to
be
married
yes
i
in
love
now
really
in
love
i
be
getting
married
in
a
couple
of
months
but
but
i
did
want
to
hurt
you
he
heard
her
begin
to
cry
but
who
how
it
matthew
she
gulped
matthew
snyder
he
sat
quiet
for
a
long
while
until
she
asked
if
he
was
still
on
the
line
yeah
he
said
tonelessly
yeah
i
still
here
after
a
fashion
shaking
himself
look
i
got
to
see
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
ca
you
sure
as
hell
can
he
said
harshly
they
met
at
a
quiet
little
bar
which
had
often
been
their
rendezvous
she
watched
him
with
frightened
eyes
while
he
ordered
martinis
all
right
he
said
at
last
what
the
story
i
he
could
barely
hear
her
there
is
any
story
i
suddenly
realized
i
loved
matt
that
all
he
made
it
a
curse
remember
what
you
told
me
about
him
before
i
felt
different
then
she
whispered
he
a
wonderful
man
when
you
get
to
know
him
he
suppressed
the
words
and
the
thought
what
so
wonderful
specifically
he
asked
he
briefly
her
face
was
rapt
fraser
had
seen
her
looking
at
him
that
way
now
and
then
go
on
he
said
grimly
enumerate
snyder
good
qualities
make
a
list
he
courteous
cultured
intelligent
young
handsome
amusing
to
hell
judy
i
do
know
she
said
in
a
high
almost
fearful
tone
i
just
love
him
that
all
she
reached
over
the
table
and
stroked
his
cheek
i
like
you
a
lot
colin
find
yourself
a
nice
girl
and
be
happy
his
mouth
drew
into
a
narrow
line
there
something
funny
here
he
said
is
it
blackmail
no
she
stood
up
spilling
her
drink
and
the
flare
of
temper
showed
him
how
overwrought
she
was
he
just
happens
to
be
the
man
i
love
that
enough
out
of
you
mr
fraser
he
sat
watching
her
go
presently
he
took
up
his
drink
gulped
it
barbarously
and
called
for
another
juan
martinez
had
come
from
puerto
rico
as
a
boy
and
made
his
own
way
ever
since
fraser
had
gotten
to
know
him
in
the
army
and
they
had
seen
each
other
from
time
to
time
since
then
martinez
had
gone
into
the
business
and
made
a
good
thing
of
it
fraser
had
to
get
past
a
very
receptionist
to
see
him
hi
colin
said
martinez
shaking
hands
he
was
a
small
dark
man
with
a
large
nose
and
beady
black
eyes
that
made
him
resemble
a
sympathetic
mouse
you
look
like
the
very
devil
i
feel
that
way
too
said
fraser
collapsing
into
a
chair
you
go
on
a
drunk
without
showing
it
well
what
the
trouble
cigarette
martinez
held
out
a
pack
give
you
the
air
as
a
matter
of
fact
yes
that
what
i
want
to
see
you
about
this
is
a
club
said
martinez
and
i
told
you
time
and
again
a
private
dick
is
a
wisecracking
superman
our
work
is
percent
routine
and
for
the
other
one
percent
we
call
in
the
police
let
me
give
you
the
story
said
fraser
he
rubbed
his
eyes
wearily
as
he
told
it
at
the
end
he
sat
staring
at
the
floor
well
said
martinez
it
too
bad
and
all
that
but
what
the
hell
there
are
other
dames
new
york
has
more
beautiful
women
per
square
inch
than
any
other
city
except
paris
latch
on
to
somebody
else
or
if
you
want
i
can
give
you
a
phone
number
you
do
understand
said
fraser
i
want
you
to
investigate
this
i
want
to
know
why
she
did
it
martinez
squinted
through
a
haze
of
smoke
snyder
a
rich
and
powerful
man
he
said
is
that
enough
no
said
fraser
too
tired
to
be
angry
at
the
hint
judy
is
that
kind
of
a
girl
neither
is
she
the
kind
to
go
overboard
in
a
few
days
especially
when
i
was
there
sure
that
sounds
conceited
but
dammit
i
she
cared
for
me
okay
you
suspect
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
yeah
it
hard
to
imagine
what
i
called
up
judy
family
in
maine
and
they
said
they
were
all
right
no
worries
nor
do
i
think
anything
in
her
own
life
would
give
a
blackmailer
or
an
extortionist
anything
to
go
on
still
i
want
to
know
martinez
drummed
the
with
nervous
fingers
i
look
into
it
if
you
insist
he
said
though
it
cost
you
a
pretty
penny
rich
men
lives
are
easy
to
pry
into
if
they
got
something
they
want
to
hide
but
i
do
think
we
find
out
much
your
case
seems
to
be
only
one
of
a
rash
of
similar
ones
in
the
past
year
huh
fraser
looked
sharply
up
yeah
i
follow
all
the
news
and
remember
the
odd
facts
there
been
a
good
dozen
cases
recently
where
beautiful
young
women
suddenly
married
rich
men
or
became
their
mistresses
it
does
all
get
into
the
papers
but
i
got
my
contacts
i
know
in
every
instance
there
was
no
obvious
reason
in
fact
the
dames
seemed
very
much
in
love
with
daddy
and
the
era
of
the
is
pretty
well
gone
fraser
sat
staring
out
the
window
it
did
seem
right
that
the
sky
should
be
so
full
of
sunshine
well
said
martinez
you
do
need
me
you
need
a
psychologist
by
god
juan
i
going
to
give
you
a
job
anyway
fraser
leaped
to
his
feet
you
going
to
check
into
an
outfit
called
sentiment
a
week
later
martinez
said
yeah
we
found
it
easily
enough
it
not
in
the
but
they
got
a
big
suite
right
in
the
district
on
fifth
the
address
is
here
in
my
written
report
nobody
in
the
building
knows
much
about
except
that
they
a
quiet
bunch
and
call
themselves
research
psychologists
they
have
a
staff
of
four
a
a
secretary
and
a
couple
of
husky
boys
who
may
be
bodyguards
for
the
boss
that
this
kennedy
robert
kennedy
my
man
could
get
into
his
office
the
girl
said
he
was
too
busy
and
never
saw
anybody
except
some
regular
clients
nor
could
he
date
either
of
the
girls
but
he
did
investigate
them
the
receptionist
is
just
a
working
girl
for
routine
stuff
married
hardly
knows
or
cares
what
going
on
the
steno
is
unmarried
has
a
degree
in
psych
lives
alone
and
seems
to
have
no
friends
except
her
boss
who
not
her
lover
by
the
way
well
how
about
kennedy
himself
asked
fraser
i
found
out
a
good
bit
but
it
all
legitimate
said
martinez
he
about
fifty
years
old
a
widower
very
steady
private
life
he
a
licensed
psychiatrist
who
used
to
practice
in
chicago
where
he
also
did
research
in
collaboration
with
a
physicist
named
gavotti
who
since
died
shortly
after
that
happened
no
there
no
suspicion
of
foul
play
the
physicist
was
an
old
man
and
died
of
a
heart
attack
anyway
kennedy
moved
to
new
york
he
still
practices
officially
but
he
does
take
just
anybody
claims
that
his
research
only
leaves
him
time
for
a
few
martinez
narrowed
his
eyes
the
only
thing
you
could
hold
against
him
is
that
he
occasionally
sees
a
guy
named
bryce
who
in
a
firm
that
has
some
dealings
with
amtorg
the
russian
trading
corporation
hm
oh
that
pretty
remote
guilt
by
association
colin
amtorg
does
have
legitimate
business
you
know
we
buy
manganese
from
them
among
other
things
and
the
rest
of
kennedy
connections
are
all
strictly
blue
ribbon
de
la
business
finance
politics
and
one
big
who
known
to
be
a
conservative
in
fact
friends
are
so
powerful
you
have
real
trouble
doing
anything
against
him
fraser
slumped
in
his
chair
i
suppose
my
notion
was
pretty
wild
he
admitted
well
there
is
one
queer
angle
you
know
these
rich
guys
suddenly
made
out
with
such
highly
desirable
dames
as
far
as
i
could
find
out
every
one
of
them
is
a
client
of
kennedy
eh
fraser
jerked
erect
a
fact
also
my
man
showed
the
building
staff
elevator
pilots
and
so
on
pictures
of
these
women
and
a
couple
of
were
remembered
as
having
come
to
see
kennedy
shortly
before
they
fell
in
love
well
that
i
ca
be
sure
of
you
know
how
people
are
about
remembering
dates
but
it
possible
fraser
shook
his
dark
head
it
unbelievable
he
said
i
thought
svengali
was
outworn
melodrama
i
know
something
about
hypnotism
colin
it
wo
do
anything
like
what
you
think
happened
to
those
girls
fraser
got
out
his
pipe
and
fumbled
tobacco
into
it
i
think
he
said
i
going
to
call
on
robert
kennedy
myself
take
it
easy
boy
said
martinez
you
been
reading
too
many
weird
stories
you
just
get
tossed
out
on
your
can
fraser
tried
to
smile
it
was
hard
judy
would
answer
his
calls
and
letters
any
more
well
he
said
it
be
in
a
worthy
cause
the
elevator
let
him
out
on
the
nineteenth
floor
it
held
four
big
suites
with
the
corridor
running
between
them
he
studied
the
doors
on
one
side
was
the
eagle
publishing
company
and
frank
dayles
brokers
on
the
other
was
the
messenger
advertising
service
and
sentiment
inc
he
entered
their
door
and
stood
in
a
quiet
reception
room
behind
the
railing
were
a
couple
of
desks
a
young
woman
working
at
each
and
two
burly
men
who
sat
boredly
reading
magazines
the
pretty
girl
obviously
the
receptionist
looked
up
as
fraser
approached
and
gave
him
a
professional
smile
yes
sir
she
asked
i
like
to
see
kennedy
please
he
said
trying
hard
to
be
casual
do
you
have
an
appointment
sir
no
but
it
urgent
i
sorry
sir
kennedy
is
very
busy
he
ca
see
anybody
except
his
regular
patients
and
research
subjects
look
take
him
in
this
note
will
you
thanks
fraser
sat
uneasily
for
some
minutes
wondering
if
he
worded
the
note
correctly
must
see
you
about
miss
judy
well
what
the
devil
else
could
you
say
the
receptionist
came
out
again
kennedy
can
spare
you
a
few
minutes
sir
she
said
go
right
on
in
thanks
fraser
slouched
toward
the
inner
door
the
two
men
lowered
their
magazines
to
follow
him
with
watchful
eyes
there
was
a
big
office
inside
with
a
door
beyond
that
must
lead
to
the
laboratory
kennedy
looked
up
from
some
papers
and
rose
holding
out
his
hand
he
was
a
man
rather
plump
graying
hair
brushed
thickly
back
from
a
broad
heavy
face
behind
rimless
glasses
yes
his
voice
was
low
and
pleasant
what
can
i
do
for
you
my
name
fraser
the
visitor
sat
down
and
accepted
a
cigarette
best
to
act
urbanely
i
know
miss
harkness
well
i
understand
you
made
some
encephalographic
studies
of
her
indeed
kennedy
looked
annoyed
and
fraser
recalled
that
judy
had
been
asked
not
to
tell
anyone
i
not
sure
i
would
have
to
consult
my
records
first
he
was
admitting
anything
thought
fraser
look
said
the
engineer
there
been
a
marked
change
in
miss
harkness
recently
i
know
enough
psychology
to
be
certain
that
such
changes
do
happen
overnight
without
cause
i
wanted
to
consult
you
i
not
her
psychiatrist
said
kennedy
coldly
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
really
have
a
lot
to
do
all
right
said
fraser
there
was
no
menace
in
his
tones
only
a
weariness
if
you
insist
i
play
it
dirty
such
abrupt
changes
indicate
mental
instability
but
i
know
she
was
perfectly
sane
before
it
begins
to
look
as
if
your
experiments
may
have
injured
her
mind
if
so
i
should
have
to
report
you
for
malpractice
kennedy
flushed
i
am
a
licensed
psychiatrist
he
said
and
any
other
doctor
will
confirm
that
miss
harkness
is
still
in
mental
health
if
you
tried
to
get
an
investigation
started
you
would
only
be
wasting
your
own
time
and
that
of
the
authorities
she
herself
will
testify
that
no
harm
was
done
to
her
no
compulsion
applied
and
that
you
are
an
infernal
busybody
with
some
delusions
of
your
own
good
afternoon
ah
said
fraser
so
she
here
kennedy
pushed
a
button
his
men
entered
show
this
gentleman
the
way
out
please
he
said
fraser
debated
whether
to
put
up
a
fight
decided
it
was
futile
and
went
out
between
the
two
others
when
he
got
to
the
street
he
found
he
was
shaking
and
badly
in
need
of
a
drink
fraser
asked
jim
did
you
ever
read
sworsky
round
freckled
face
lifted
to
regard
him
years
ago
he
answered
what
of
it
tell
me
something
is
it
possible
even
theoretically
possible
to
do
what
svengali
did
change
emotional
attitudes
just
like
that
fraser
snapped
his
fingers
i
do
know
said
sworsky
nuclear
are
more
in
my
line
but
offhand
i
should
imagine
it
might
be
done
sometime
in
the
far
future
the
labeling
of
this
as
good
and
that
as
bad
seem
to
be
matters
of
established
neural
paths
if
you
could
selectively
alter
the
polarization
of
individual
neurones
but
it
a
pretty
remote
prospect
we
hardly
know
a
thing
about
the
brain
today
he
studied
his
friend
sympathetically
i
know
it
tough
to
get
jilted
he
said
but
do
go
off
your
trolley
about
it
i
could
stand
it
if
someone
else
had
gotten
her
in
the
usual
kind
of
way
said
fraser
thinly
but
this
look
let
me
tell
you
all
found
out
sworsky
shook
his
head
at
the
end
of
the
story
that
a
mighty
wild
speculation
he
murmured
i
forget
it
if
i
were
you
did
you
know
kennedy
old
partner
gavotti
at
chicago
sure
i
met
him
a
few
times
nice
old
guy
very
unworldly
completely
wrapped
up
in
his
work
he
got
interested
in
neurology
from
the
physics
angle
toward
the
end
of
his
life
and
contributed
a
lot
to
cybernetics
what
of
it
i
do
know
said
fraser
i
just
do
know
but
do
me
a
favor
will
you
jim
judy
wo
see
me
at
all
but
she
knows
you
and
likes
you
ask
her
to
dinner
or
something
insist
that
she
come
then
you
and
your
wife
find
out
whatever
you
can
just
exactly
how
she
feels
about
the
whole
business
what
her
attitudes
are
toward
everything
the
name
is
sworsky
not
holmes
but
sure
i
do
what
i
can
if
you
promise
to
try
and
get
rid
of
this
fixation
you
ought
to
see
a
yourself
you
know
vino
sometimes
too
damn
much
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
judy
was
talking
freely
if
not
quite
coherently
i
cared
a
lot
for
colin
she
said
it
was
pretty
wonderful
having
him
around
he
a
grand
guy
only
matt
i
do
know
matt
has
got
half
of
what
colin
has
matt
a
mind
afraid
i
just
going
to
be
an
ornamental
convenience
to
him
only
if
you
ever
been
so
you
got
all
dizzy
when
someone
was
around
and
thought
about
him
all
the
time
he
was
away
well
that
how
he
is
nothing
else
matters
colin
gotten
a
funny
obsession
said
sworsky
cautiously
he
thinks
kennedy
hypnotized
you
for
snyder
i
keep
telling
him
it
impossible
but
he
ca
get
over
the
idea
oh
no
no
no
she
said
with
too
much
fervor
it
nothing
like
that
i
tell
you
just
what
happened
we
had
those
two
measuring
sessions
it
was
kind
of
dull
but
nothing
else
and
then
the
third
time
kennedy
did
put
me
under
hypnosis
he
called
it
that
at
least
i
went
to
sleep
and
woke
up
about
an
hour
later
and
he
sent
me
home
i
felt
all
good
inside
happy
and
shlo
slowly
i
began
to
see
what
matt
meant
to
me
i
called
him
up
that
evening
he
said
kennedy
machine
speed
up
people
minds
for
a
short
while
sometimes
so
they
decided
what
worked
out
anyway
kennedy
is
i
do
know
it
funny
how
ordinary
he
seemed
at
first
but
when
you
get
to
know
him
like
god
almost
he
strong
and
wise
and
good
he
her
voice
trailed
off
and
she
sat
looking
foolishly
at
her
glass
you
know
said
sworsky
perhaps
colin
is
right
after
all
do
say
that
she
jumped
up
and
slapped
his
face
kennedy
i
tell
you
all
you
little
lice
sitting
here
making
sly
remarks
behind
his
back
and
he
so
much
bigger
than
all
of
you
and
she
broke
into
tears
and
stormed
out
of
the
apartment
sworsky
reported
the
affair
to
fraser
i
wonder
he
said
it
seem
natural
i
agree
but
what
can
anybody
do
the
police
i
tried
said
fraser
dully
they
laughed
when
i
insisted
i
damn
near
got
myself
jugged
that
no
use
the
trouble
is
none
of
the
people
who
been
under
the
machine
will
testify
against
kennedy
he
fixes
it
so
they
worship
him
i
still
think
you
crazy
there
be
a
simpler
hypothesis
i
refuse
to
believe
your
screwy
notions
without
some
real
evidence
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
well
said
fraser
with
a
tautness
in
his
voice
i
got
several
thousand
dollars
saved
up
and
juan
martinez
will
help
ever
hear
the
fable
about
the
lion
he
licked
hell
out
of
the
bear
and
the
tiger
and
the
rhinoceros
but
a
little
gnat
finally
drove
him
nuts
maybe
i
can
be
the
gnat
he
shook
his
head
but
i
have
to
hurry
the
only
six
weeks
off
it
can
be
annoying
to
be
constantly
shadowed
to
have
nasty
gossip
about
you
spreading
through
the
places
where
you
work
and
live
to
find
your
tires
slashed
to
be
accosted
by
truculent
drunks
when
you
stop
in
for
a
quick
one
to
have
loud
horns
blow
under
your
window
every
night
and
it
does
do
much
good
to
call
the
police
your
petty
tormentors
always
fade
out
of
sight
fraser
was
sitting
in
his
room
some
two
weeks
later
trying
unsuccessfully
to
concentrate
on
matrix
algebra
when
the
phone
rang
he
never
picked
it
up
without
a
fluttering
small
hope
that
it
might
be
judy
and
it
never
was
this
time
it
was
a
man
voice
mr
fraser
yeah
he
grunted
want
this
is
robert
kennedy
i
like
to
talk
to
you
fraser
heart
sprang
in
his
ribs
but
he
held
his
voice
stiff
go
on
then
talk
i
want
you
to
come
up
to
my
place
we
may
be
having
a
long
conversation
mmmm
well
it
was
more
than
he
had
allowed
himself
to
hope
for
but
he
remained
curt
okay
but
a
full
report
of
this
business
and
what
i
think
you
doing
is
in
the
hands
of
several
people
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
you
been
reading
too
many
said
kennedy
nothing
will
happen
anyway
i
have
a
pretty
good
idea
who
those
people
are
i
can
hire
detectives
of
my
own
you
know
i
come
over
then
fraser
hung
up
and
realized
suddenly
that
he
was
sweating
the
night
air
was
cool
as
he
walked
down
the
street
he
paused
for
a
moment
feeling
the
city
like
a
huge
impersonal
machine
around
him
grinding
and
grinding
human
civilization
had
grown
too
big
he
thought
it
was
beyond
anyone
control
it
had
taken
on
a
will
of
its
own
and
was
carrying
a
race
which
could
no
longer
guide
it
sometimes
reading
the
papers
or
listening
to
the
radio
or
just
watching
the
traffic
go
by
like
a
river
of
steel
a
man
could
feel
horribly
helpless
he
took
the
subway
to
kennedy
address
a
swank
apartment
in
the
lower
fifties
he
was
admitted
by
the
psychiatrist
in
person
no
one
else
was
around
i
assume
said
kennedy
that
you
do
have
some
wild
idea
of
pulling
a
gun
on
me
that
would
accomplish
nothing
except
to
get
you
in
trouble
no
said
fraser
i
be
good
his
eyes
wandered
about
the
living
room
one
wall
was
covered
with
books
which
looked
used
there
were
some
quality
reproductions
a
capehart
and
fine
massive
furniture
it
was
a
tasteful
layout
he
looked
a
little
more
closely
at
three
pictures
on
the
mantel
a
woman
and
two
young
men
in
uniform
my
wife
said
kennedy
and
my
boys
they
all
dead
would
you
like
a
drink
no
i
came
to
talk
i
not
satan
you
know
said
kennedy
i
like
books
and
music
good
wine
good
conversation
i
as
human
as
you
are
only
i
have
a
purpose
fraser
sat
down
and
began
charging
his
pipe
go
ahead
he
said
listening
kennedy
pulled
a
chair
over
to
face
him
the
big
smooth
countenance
behind
the
rimless
glasses
held
little
expression
why
have
you
been
annoying
me
he
asked
i
fraser
lifted
his
brows
kennedy
made
an
impatient
gesture
let
not
chop
words
there
are
no
witnesses
tonight
i
intend
to
talk
freely
and
want
you
to
do
the
same
i
know
that
you
got
martinez
sufficiently
convinced
to
help
you
with
this
very
childish
what
do
you
hope
to
get
out
of
it
i
want
my
girl
back
said
fraser
tonelessly
i
was
hoping
my
kennedy
winced
a
bit
you
know
i
damned
sorry
about
that
it
the
one
aspect
of
my
work
which
i
hate
i
like
you
to
believe
that
i
not
just
a
scientific
procurer
actually
i
have
to
satisfy
the
minor
desires
of
my
clients
so
they
stay
happy
and
agree
to
my
major
wishes
it
the
plain
truth
that
those
women
have
been
only
the
minutest
fraction
of
my
job
nevertheless
you
a
son
doing
something
like
that
really
now
what
so
horrible
about
it
those
girls
are
in
love
the
normal
genuine
article
it
not
any
kind
of
zombie
state
or
whatever
your
overheated
imagination
has
thought
up
they
entirely
sane
unharmed
and
happy
in
fact
happiness
of
that
kind
is
so
rare
in
this
world
that
if
i
wanted
to
i
could
pose
as
their
benefactor
you
got
a
machine
said
fraser
it
changes
the
mind
as
far
as
concerned
that
as
gross
a
violation
of
liberty
as
throwing
somebody
into
a
concentration
camp
how
free
do
you
think
anyone
is
you
born
with
a
fixed
heredity
environment
molds
you
like
clay
your
society
teaches
you
what
and
how
to
think
a
million
tiny
factors
all
depending
on
blind
uncontrollable
chance
determine
the
course
of
your
life
including
your
well
we
need
waste
any
time
on
philosophy
go
on
ask
some
questions
i
admit
i
hurt
you
unwittingly
to
be
sure
but
i
do
want
to
make
amends
your
machine
then
said
fraser
how
did
you
get
it
how
does
it
work
i
was
practicing
in
chicago
said
kennedy
and
collaborating
on
the
side
with
gavotti
how
much
do
you
know
of
cybernetics
i
do
mean
computers
and
automata
which
are
only
one
aspect
of
the
field
i
mean
control
and
communication
in
the
animal
as
well
as
in
the
machine
well
i
read
wiener
books
and
studied
shannon
work
too
despite
himself
fraser
was
thawing
just
a
trifle
it
exciting
stuff
seems
to
be
basic
in
biology
and
psychology
as
well
as
in
electronics
quite
the
future
may
remember
wiener
as
the
galileo
of
neurology
if
gavotti
work
ever
gets
published
he
be
considered
the
newton
so
far
frankly
i
suppressed
it
he
died
suddenly
just
when
his
machine
was
completed
and
he
was
getting
ready
to
publish
his
results
nobody
but
i
knew
anything
more
than
rumors
he
was
inclined
to
be
secretive
till
he
had
a
on
hand
i
realized
what
an
opportunity
had
been
given
me
and
took
it
i
brought
the
machine
here
without
saying
much
to
anyone
kennedy
leaned
back
in
his
chair
i
imagine
it
was
mostly
luck
which
took
gavotti
and
me
so
far
he
went
on
we
made
a
long
series
of
improbably
good
guesses
and
thus
telescoped
a
century
of
work
into
a
decade
if
i
were
religious
i
be
down
on
my
knees
thanking
the
lord
for
putting
this
thing
of
the
future
into
my
hands
or
the
devil
said
fraser
briefly
anger
flitted
across
kennedy
face
i
grant
you
the
machine
is
a
terrible
power
but
it
harmless
to
a
man
if
it
used
properly
as
i
have
used
it
i
not
going
to
tell
you
just
how
it
works
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
only
understand
a
fraction
of
its
theory
and
its
circuits
myself
but
look
you
know
something
of
encephalography
the
various
basic
rhythms
of
the
brain
have
been
measured
the
standard
method
is
already
so
sensitive
that
it
can
detect
abnormalities
like
a
developing
tumor
or
a
strong
emotional
disturbance
that
will
give
trouble
unless
corrected
half
of
gavotti
machine
is
a
still
more
delicate
encephalograph
it
can
measure
and
analyze
the
minute
variations
in
electrical
pulses
corresponding
to
the
basic
emotional
states
it
wo
read
thoughts
no
but
once
calibrated
for
a
given
individual
it
will
tell
you
if
he
happy
sorrowful
angry
disgusted
afraid
any
fundamental
condition
or
any
combination
of
them
he
paused
all
right
said
fraser
what
else
does
it
do
it
does
make
monsters
said
kennedy
look
the
specific
emotional
reaction
to
a
given
stimulus
is
in
the
normal
individual
largely
a
matter
of
conditioned
reflex
instilled
by
social
environment
or
the
accidental
associations
of
his
life
anyone
in
decent
health
will
experience
fear
in
the
presence
of
danger
desire
in
the
presence
of
a
sexual
object
and
so
on
basic
biology
and
the
machine
ca
change
that
but
most
of
our
evaluations
are
learned
for
instance
to
an
american
the
word
has
powerful
emotional
connotations
while
to
a
samoan
it
means
nothing
very
exciting
you
had
to
develop
a
taste
for
liquor
tobacco
coffee
in
fact
most
of
what
you
consume
if
you
in
love
with
a
particular
woman
it
a
focusing
of
the
general
sexual
libido
on
her
brought
about
by
the
symbolizing
part
of
your
mind
she
something
to
you
there
are
cultures
without
romantic
love
you
know
and
so
on
all
these
specific
conditioned
reactions
can
be
changed
how
kennedy
thought
for
a
moment
the
encephalographic
part
of
the
machine
measures
the
exact
pulsations
in
the
individual
corresponding
to
the
various
emotional
reactions
it
takes
me
about
four
hours
to
determine
those
with
the
necessary
precision
then
i
have
to
make
statistical
analyses
of
the
data
to
winnow
out
random
variations
thereafter
i
put
the
subject
in
a
state
of
light
hypnosis
that
only
to
increase
suggestibility
and
make
the
process
faster
as
i
pronounce
the
words
and
names
i
interested
in
the
machine
feeds
back
the
impulses
corresponding
to
the
emotions
i
want
a
beam
on
the
brain
center
concerned
for
instance
suppose
you
were
an
alcoholic
and
i
wanted
to
cure
you
i
put
you
in
hypnosis
and
stand
there
whispering
whisky
beer
gin
and
so
on
meanwhile
the
machine
would
be
feeding
the
impulses
corresponding
to
your
reactions
of
hate
fear
and
disgust
into
your
brain
you
come
out
unchanged
except
that
your
appetite
for
alcohol
would
be
gone
you
could
in
fact
come
out
hating
the
stuff
so
much
that
you
join
the
prohibition
party
though
in
actual
practice
it
would
probably
be
enough
just
to
give
you
a
mild
aversion
mmmm
i
see
maybe
fraser
scowled
and
the
subject
remember
what
you
done
oh
no
it
all
takes
place
on
the
lower
subconscious
levels
a
new
set
of
conditioned
neural
pathways
is
opened
you
see
and
old
ones
are
closed
off
the
brain
does
that
by
itself
through
its
normal
symbolizing
mechanism
all
that
happens
is
that
the
given
symbol
such
as
liquor
becomes
reflectively
associated
with
the
given
emotional
state
such
as
dislike
kennedy
leaned
forward
with
an
air
of
urgency
the
end
result
is
in
no
way
different
from
ordinary
means
of
persuasion
propaganda
does
the
same
thing
by
sheer
repetition
if
you
courting
a
girl
you
try
to
identify
yourself
in
her
mind
with
the
things
she
desires
by
appropriate
behavior
i
sorry
i
should
have
used
that
example
the
machine
is
only
a
direct
fast
way
of
doing
this
producing
a
more
stable
result
it
still
tampering
said
fraser
how
do
you
know
you
not
creating
doing
irreparable
damage
oh
for
lord
sake
exploded
kennedy
take
your
mind
off
that
shelf
will
you
i
told
you
how
delicate
the
whole
thing
is
a
few
microwatts
of
power
more
or
less
a
of
less
than
one
percent
and
it
does
work
at
all
there
no
effect
whatsoever
he
cooled
off
fast
adding
reflectively
on
the
given
subject
that
is
it
might
work
on
someone
else
these
pulsations
are
a
highly
individual
matter
i
have
to
calibrate
every
case
separately
there
was
a
long
period
of
silence
then
fraser
strained
forward
and
said
in
an
ugly
voice
all
right
you
told
me
how
you
do
it
now
tell
me
what
possible
reason
or
excuse
other
than
your
own
desire
to
play
god
this
thing
could
be
the
greatest
psychiatric
tool
in
history
and
using
it
to
pimp
i
told
you
that
was
unimportant
said
kennedy
quietly
i
doing
much
more
i
set
up
in
practice
here
in
new
york
a
couple
of
years
ago
once
i
had
a
few
chance
people
under
control
no
i
tell
you
again
i
make
robots
of
them
i
merely
associated
myself
in
their
own
minds
with
the
that
something
i
do
to
everyone
who
comes
under
the
machine
just
as
a
precaution
if
nothing
else
kennedy
is
kennedy
can
do
no
wrong
it
is
a
conscious
realization
to
the
waking
mind
i
am
only
a
shrewd
adviser
and
a
damn
swell
fellow
but
the
subconscious
mind
knows
otherwise
it
would
my
subjects
act
against
me
it
would
even
let
them
want
to
well
you
see
how
it
goes
i
got
those
first
few
people
to
recommend
me
to
certain
selected
friends
and
these
in
turn
recommended
me
to
others
not
necessarily
as
a
psychiatrist
i
have
variously
been
a
doctor
a
counsellor
or
merely
a
looking
for
data
but
i
building
up
a
group
of
the
people
i
want
people
who
back
me
up
who
follow
my
advice
not
with
any
knowledge
of
being
dominated
but
because
the
workings
of
their
own
subconscious
minds
will
lead
them
inevitably
to
think
that
my
advice
is
the
only
sound
policy
to
follow
and
my
requests
are
things
any
decent
man
must
grant
yeah
said
fraser
i
get
it
big
businessmen
politicians
military
men
and
soviet
spies
kennedy
nodded
i
have
connections
with
the
soviets
their
agents
think
i
on
their
side
but
it
is
treason
though
i
may
help
them
out
from
time
to
time
that
why
i
have
to
do
these
services
for
my
important
clients
such
as
getting
them
the
women
they
want
or
what
i
actually
do
more
often
influencing
their
competitors
and
associates
you
see
the
subconscious
mind
knows
i
am
but
the
conscious
mind
does
it
has
to
be
satisfied
by
occasional
proofs
that
i
invaluable
otherwise
conflicts
would
set
in
my
men
would
become
unstable
and
eventually
psychotic
and
be
of
no
further
use
to
me
of
course
he
added
almost
pedantically
my
men
do
know
how
i
persuade
these
other
people
they
only
know
that
i
do
somehow
and
their
regard
for
their
own
egos
as
well
as
for
me
sets
up
a
bloc
which
prevents
them
from
reasoning
out
the
fact
that
they
themselves
are
dominated
they
quite
content
to
accept
the
results
of
my
help
without
inquiring
further
into
the
means
than
the
easy
rationalization
that
i
have
a
personality
i
do
like
what
i
doing
fraser
but
it
got
to
be
done
you
still
have
said
got
to
be
done
answered
the
engineer
coldly
i
been
given
something
unbelievable
said
kennedy
his
voice
was
very
soft
now
if
i
made
it
public
can
you
imagine
what
would
have
happened
psychiatrists
would
use
it
yes
but
so
would
criminals
dictators
men
of
all
kinds
even
in
this
country
i
think
libertarian
principles
could
long
survive
it
would
be
too
simple
and
yet
it
would
have
been
cowardly
to
break
the
machine
and
burn
gavotti
notes
chance
has
given
me
the
power
to
be
more
than
a
chip
in
the
river
a
river
that
rapidly
approaching
a
waterfall
war
destruction
tyranny
no
matter
who
the
pyrrhic
victor
may
be
i
in
a
position
to
do
something
for
the
causes
in
which
i
believe
and
what
are
they
asked
fraser
kennedy
gestured
at
the
pictures
on
the
mantel
both
my
sons
were
killed
in
the
last
war
my
wife
died
of
cancer
a
disease
which
would
be
licked
now
if
a
fraction
of
the
money
spent
on
armaments
had
been
diverted
to
research
that
brought
it
home
to
me
but
there
are
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
in
worse
cases
and
war
is
the
only
evil
there
is
poverty
oppression
inequality
want
and
suffering
it
could
be
changed
i
building
up
my
own
lobby
you
might
say
in
a
few
more
years
i
hope
to
be
the
indispensable
adviser
of
all
the
men
who
between
them
really
run
this
country
and
yes
i
have
been
in
touch
with
soviet
agents
have
even
acted
as
a
transmitter
of
stolen
information
the
basic
problem
of
spying
you
know
is
not
to
get
the
information
in
the
first
place
as
much
as
to
get
it
to
the
homeland
treason
no
i
think
not
i
getting
my
toehold
in
world
communism
i
already
have
some
of
its
agents
sooner
or
later
i
get
to
the
men
who
really
matter
then
communism
will
no
longer
be
a
menace
he
sighed
it
a
hard
row
to
hoe
it
take
my
lifetime
at
least
but
what
else
have
i
got
to
give
my
life
to
fraser
sat
quiet
his
pipe
was
cold
he
knocked
it
out
and
began
filling
it
afresh
the
scratching
of
his
match
seemed
unnaturally
loud
too
much
he
said
it
too
big
a
job
for
one
man
to
tackle
the
world
will
stumble
along
somehow
but
you
just
get
things
into
a
worse
mess
i
got
to
try
said
kennedy
and
i
still
want
my
girl
back
i
ca
do
that
i
need
snyder
too
much
but
i
make
it
up
to
you
somehow
kennedy
sighed
lord
if
you
knew
how
much
i
wanted
to
tell
all
this
with
sudden
wariness
not
that
it
to
be
repeated
in
fact
you
to
lay
off
me
call
off
your
dogs
do
try
to
tell
anyone
else
what
told
you
you
never
be
believed
and
i
already
have
enough
power
to
suppress
the
story
if
you
should
get
it
out
somehow
and
if
you
give
me
any
more
trouble
at
all
i
see
to
it
that
you
stop
murder
or
commitment
to
an
asylum
i
can
arrange
that
too
fraser
sighed
he
felt
oddly
unexcited
empty
as
if
the
interview
had
drained
him
of
his
last
will
to
resist
he
held
the
pipe
loosely
in
his
fingers
letting
it
go
out
ask
me
a
favor
urged
kennedy
i
do
it
if
it
wo
harm
my
own
program
i
tell
you
i
want
to
square
things
well
think
about
it
let
me
know
all
right
fraser
got
up
i
may
do
that
he
went
out
the
door
without
saying
goodnight
he
sat
with
his
feet
on
the
table
chair
tilted
back
and
teetering
dangerously
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
pipe
filling
the
room
with
blue
fog
it
was
his
usual
posture
for
attacking
a
problem
and
damn
it
he
thought
wearily
this
was
a
question
such
as
he
made
his
living
on
an
industrial
engineer
comes
into
the
office
we
want
this
and
that
a
machine
for
a
very
special
purpose
let
say
what
should
we
do
fraser
fraser
prowls
around
the
plant
reads
up
on
the
industry
and
then
sits
down
and
thinks
the
elements
of
the
problem
are
how
can
they
be
combined
to
yield
a
solution
normally
he
uses
the
mathematical
approach
especially
in
machine
design
most
have
a
pathetic
math
background
they
use
ten
pages
of
elaborate
algebra
and
rusty
calculus
to
figure
out
something
that
three
vector
equations
would
solve
but
you
have
to
get
the
logical
basics
straight
first
before
you
can
set
up
your
equations
all
right
what
is
the
problem
to
get
judy
back
that
means
forcing
kennedy
to
restore
her
normal
emotional
reactions
no
he
did
want
her
thrust
into
love
of
him
he
just
wanted
her
as
she
had
been
what
are
the
elements
of
the
problem
kennedy
acts
outside
the
law
but
he
has
blocked
all
official
channels
he
even
has
connections
extending
through
the
iron
curtain
hmmmm
appeal
to
the
fbi
kennedy
could
have
control
over
them
however
if
fraser
tried
to
tip
off
the
fbi
they
act
cautiously
if
they
investigated
at
all
they
have
to
go
slow
and
kennedy
would
find
out
in
time
to
do
something
about
it
martinez
could
help
no
further
sworsky
had
closer
contact
with
washington
he
been
so
thoroughly
cleared
that
they
be
inclined
to
trust
whatever
he
said
but
sworsky
doubted
the
whole
story
like
many
men
who
suffered
through
irresponsible
congressional
charges
he
was
almost
fanatic
about
having
proof
before
accusing
anyone
of
anything
moreover
kennedy
knew
that
sworsky
was
fraser
friend
he
probably
be
keeping
close
tabs
on
the
physicist
and
ready
to
block
any
attempts
he
might
make
to
help
with
the
backing
of
a
man
like
snyder
kennedy
could
hire
as
many
detectives
as
he
wanted
in
fact
whatever
the
it
was
necessary
to
go
warily
kennedy
threat
to
get
rid
of
fraser
if
the
engineer
kept
working
against
him
was
not
idle
mouthing
he
could
do
it
and
being
a
fanatic
would
but
kennedy
like
the
demon
of
legend
would
grant
one
wish
just
to
salve
his
own
conscience
only
what
should
the
wish
be
another
woman
or
merely
to
be
reconciled
artificially
to
an
situation
judy
judy
fraser
swore
at
himself
damn
it
to
hell
this
was
a
problem
in
logic
no
room
for
emotion
of
course
it
might
be
a
problem
without
a
solution
there
are
plenty
of
those
he
squinted
trying
to
visualize
the
office
he
thought
of
burglary
stealing
evidence
silly
thought
but
let
see
now
what
was
the
layout
exactly
four
suites
on
one
floor
of
the
skyscraper
three
of
them
unimportant
offices
of
unimportant
men
and
lord
fraser
sat
for
a
long
while
hardly
moving
then
he
uncoiled
himself
and
ran
downstairs
and
into
the
street
and
to
the
nearest
pay
phone
his
own
line
might
be
tapped
hello
hello
juan
yes
i
know
i
got
you
out
of
bed
and
i
not
sorry
this
is
too
bloody
important
okay
okay
look
i
want
a
complete
report
on
the
messenger
advertising
service
when
immediately
if
not
sooner
and
i
mean
that
right
messenger
okay
fine
i
buy
you
a
drink
sometime
hello
jim
were
you
asleep
too
sorry
but
look
would
you
make
a
list
of
all
the
important
men
you
know
fairly
well
i
need
it
bad
no
do
come
over
i
think
i
better
not
see
you
for
a
while
just
mail
it
to
me
all
right
so
i
am
paranoid
jerome
ferris
was
a
large
man
with
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
that
was
even
larger
he
sat
hunched
in
the
chair
his
head
dwarfed
by
the
aluminum
helmet
his
breathing
shallow
around
him
danced
and
flickered
a
hundred
meters
indicator
lights
tubes
there
was
a
low
humming
in
the
room
otherwise
it
was
altogether
silent
blocked
and
shielded
against
the
outside
world
the
fluorescent
lights
were
a
muted
glow
fraser
sat
watching
the
greenish
trace
on
the
huge
oscilloscope
screen
it
was
an
intricate
set
of
convolutions
looking
more
like
a
plate
of
spaghetti
than
anything
else
he
wondered
how
many
frequencies
were
involved
several
thousand
at
the
very
least
fraser
repeated
kennedy
softly
into
the
ear
of
the
hypnotized
man
colin
fraser
colin
fraser
he
touched
a
dial
with
infinite
care
colin
fraser
colin
fraser
the
oscilloscope
flickered
as
he
readjusted
a
new
trace
appeared
kennedy
waited
for
a
while
then
robert
kennedy
sentiment
robert
kennedy
sentiment
robert
kennedy
sentiment
he
turned
off
the
machine
its
murmur
and
glow
died
away
facing
fraser
with
a
tight
little
smile
he
said
all
right
your
job
is
done
are
we
even
now
as
even
as
we
ever
get
i
suppose
said
fraser
i
wish
you
trust
me
said
kennedy
with
a
hint
of
wistfulness
have
done
the
job
honestly
you
did
have
to
watch
well
i
was
interested
said
fraser
frankly
i
still
do
see
what
you
stand
to
gain
by
the
doglike
devotion
of
this
ferris
he
rich
but
he
too
weak
and
to
be
a
leader
i
never
planned
on
conditioning
him
for
my
purposes
i
explained
that
said
fraser
patiently
ferris
is
a
large
stockholder
in
a
number
of
corporations
his
influence
can
swing
a
lot
of
business
my
way
yes
i
know
i
did
grant
your
wish
blindly
you
realize
i
had
ferris
studied
he
unable
to
harm
me
kennedy
regarded
fraser
with
hard
eyes
and
just
in
case
you
still
have
foolish
notions
please
remember
that
i
gave
him
the
with
respect
to
myself
he
do
a
lot
for
you
but
not
if
it
going
to
hurt
me
in
any
way
i
know
when
i
licked
said
fraser
bleakly
i
getting
out
of
town
as
soon
as
i
finish
those
courses
i
signed
up
for
kennedy
snapped
his
fingers
all
right
ferris
wake
up
now
ferris
blinked
what
been
happening
he
asked
nothing
much
said
kennedy
unbuckling
the
electrodes
i
taken
my
readings
thank
you
very
much
for
the
help
sir
i
see
that
you
get
due
credit
when
my
research
is
published
ah
yes
yes
ferris
puffed
himself
out
then
he
put
an
arm
around
fraser
shoulder
if
you
are
busy
he
said
maybe
we
could
go
have
lunch
thanks
said
fraser
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
a
few
things
he
lingered
for
a
moment
after
ferris
had
left
the
room
i
imagine
this
is
goodbye
for
us
he
said
well
so
long
at
least
we
probably
hear
from
each
other
again
kennedy
shook
fraser
hand
no
hard
feelings
i
did
go
to
a
lot
of
trouble
for
you
wangling
your
introduction
to
ferris
when
you
named
him
and
having
one
of
my
men
persuade
him
to
come
here
and
right
when
i
so
infernally
busy
too
sure
said
fraser
it
all
right
i
ca
pretend
to
love
you
for
what
you
done
but
you
are
a
bad
sort
no
worse
than
you
said
kennedy
with
a
short
laugh
you
used
the
machine
for
your
own
ends
now
yeah
said
fraser
i
guess
i
have
sworsky
asked
why
do
you
insist
on
calling
me
from
drugstores
and
why
at
my
office
i
got
a
home
phone
you
know
i
not
sure
but
that
our
own
lines
are
tapped
said
fraser
kennedy
a
smart
cookie
and
do
you
forget
it
i
think
he
about
ready
to
dismiss
me
as
a
danger
but
you
certainly
being
watched
you
on
his
list
you
getting
a
honest
colin
i
worried
well
bear
with
me
for
a
while
now
have
you
had
any
information
on
kennedy
since
i
called
last
hm
no
i
did
mention
to
thomson
as
you
asked
me
to
that
i
heard
rumors
of
some
revolutionary
encephalographic
techniques
and
would
be
interested
in
seeing
the
work
why
did
you
want
me
to
do
that
thomson
said
fraser
is
one
of
kennedy
men
now
look
jim
before
long
you
going
to
be
invited
to
visit
kennedy
he
give
you
a
spiel
about
his
research
and
ask
to
measure
your
brain
waves
i
want
you
to
say
yes
then
i
want
to
know
the
exact
times
of
the
three
appointments
he
give
you
the
first
two
at
least
hmmm
if
kennedy
doing
what
you
claim
jim
it
a
necessary
risk
but
the
one
who
taking
it
be
okay
i
promise
you
though
perhaps
later
you
read
of
me
being
found
in
the
river
you
see
i
got
kennedy
to
influence
a
big
stockowner
for
me
one
of
the
lesser
companies
in
which
he
has
a
loud
voice
is
messenger
i
do
suppose
kennedy
knows
that
i
hope
not
sworsky
looked
as
if
he
been
sandbagged
he
was
white
and
the
hand
that
poured
a
drink
shook
lord
he
muttered
lord
colin
you
were
right
fraser
teeth
drew
back
from
his
lips
you
went
through
with
it
eh
yes
i
let
the
son
hypnotize
me
and
afterward
i
walked
off
with
a
dreamy
expression
as
you
told
me
to
just
three
hours
ago
he
dropped
around
here
in
person
he
gave
me
a
long
rigmarole
about
the
stupidity
of
military
secrecy
and
how
the
soviet
union
stands
for
peace
and
justice
i
hope
i
acted
impressed
i
not
much
of
an
actor
you
do
have
to
be
just
so
you
did
overdo
it
to
one
of
victims
obeying
his
advice
is
so
natural
that
it
does
call
for
any
wonderment
and
he
wanted
data
from
me
bombardment
critical
values
resonance
levels
my
lord
if
the
russians
found
that
out
through
spies
it
save
them
three
years
of
research
this
is
an
fbi
case
all
right
no
not
yet
fraser
laid
an
urgent
hand
on
sworsky
arm
stuck
by
me
so
far
jim
go
along
a
little
further
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
why
fraser
laugh
jarred
out
give
him
what
he
wants
of
course
kennedy
looked
up
from
his
desk
scowling
all
right
fraser
he
said
you
been
a
damned
nuisance
and
it
pretty
patient
of
me
to
see
you
again
but
this
is
the
last
time
want
it
the
last
time
i
need
to
see
you
perhaps
fraser
did
sit
down
he
stood
facing
kennedy
you
had
it
friend
straight
up
what
do
you
mean
kennedy
hand
moved
toward
his
buzzer
listen
before
you
do
anything
said
fraser
harshly
i
know
you
tried
to
bring
jim
sworsky
under
the
influence
you
asked
him
for
data
a
few
hours
ago
you
handed
the
file
he
brought
you
on
to
bryce
who
no
doubt
at
the
amtorg
offices
this
minute
that
high
treason
kennedy
they
execute
people
for
doing
that
the
psychologist
slumped
back
do
try
to
have
your
bully
boys
get
rid
of
me
said
fraser
sworsky
is
sitting
by
the
phone
waiting
to
call
the
fbi
i
the
only
guy
who
can
stop
him
but
kennedy
tongue
ran
around
his
lips
but
he
committed
treason
himself
he
gave
me
the
papers
fraser
grinned
you
do
think
those
were
authentic
do
you
i
doubt
if
you
be
very
popular
in
the
soviet
union
either
once
they
tried
to
build
machines
using
your
data
kennedy
looked
down
at
the
floor
how
did
you
do
it
he
whispered
remember
ferris
the
guy
you
fixed
up
for
me
he
owns
a
share
of
your
neighbor
the
messenger
advertising
service
i
fed
him
a
song
and
dance
about
needing
an
office
to
do
some
important
work
only
my
very
whereabouts
had
to
be
secret
the
messenger
people
were
moved
out
without
anybody
knowing
i
installed
myself
there
one
night
also
a
simple
little
electric
oscillator
encephalography
is
damn
delicate
work
it
involves
amplifications
up
to
several
million
the
apparatus
misbehaves
if
you
give
it
a
hard
look
naturally
your
lab
and
the
machine
were
heavily
shielded
but
even
so
a
radio
emitter
next
door
would
be
bound
to
throw
you
off
my
main
trouble
was
in
lousing
you
up
just
a
little
bit
not
enough
to
make
you
suspect
anything
i
only
worked
at
that
during
your
calibrating
sessions
with
sworsky
i
did
have
to
be
there
when
you
turned
the
beam
on
him
because
it
would
be
calculated
from
false
data
and
be
so
far
from
his
pattern
as
to
have
no
effect
you
told
me
yourself
how
precise
an
adjustment
was
needed
sworsky
played
along
then
now
we
got
proof
not
that
you
meddled
with
human
lives
but
that
you
are
a
spy
kennedy
sat
without
moving
his
voice
was
a
broken
mumble
i
was
going
to
change
the
world
i
had
hopes
for
all
humankind
and
you
for
the
sake
of
one
woman
i
never
trusted
anybody
with
a
messiah
complex
the
world
is
too
big
to
change
you
just
have
bungled
it
up
worse
than
it
already
is
a
lot
of
dictators
started
out
as
reformers
and
ended
up
as
you
have
done
the
same
fraser
leaned
over
his
desk
i
willing
to
make
a
deal
though
he
went
on
your
teeth
are
pulled
there
no
point
in
turning
you
in
sworsky
and
martinez
and
i
are
willing
just
to
report
on
bryce
and
let
you
go
if
you
change
back
all
your
subjects
we
going
to
read
your
files
and
watch
and
see
that
you
do
it
every
one
kennedy
bit
his
lip
and
the
machine
i
do
know
we
settle
that
later
okay
god
here
the

number
of
judy
harkness
ask
her
to
come
over
for

special
treatment
at
once
a
month
later
the
papers
had
a
story
about
a
plausible
maniac
who
had
talked
his
way
into
the
columbia
university
laboratories
where
gavotti
puzzling
machine
was
being
studied
and
pulled
out
a
hammer
and
smashed
it
into
ruin
before
he
could
be
stopped
taken
to
jail
he
committed
suicide
in
his
cell
the
name
was
kennedy
fraser
felt
vague
regret
but
it
did
take
him
long
to
forget
it
he
was
too
busy
making
plans
for
his
wedding
