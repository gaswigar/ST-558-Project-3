christmas

i
do
stumbling
over
their
own
feet
and
bundles
the

into
the
warm
kitchen

was
saying

in

old
song
that
christmas
day
virtually
began
a
whole
year
beforehand
with
a
letter
written
by
guy
fernald
to
his
younger
sister
nan
who
had
been
married
to
samuel
burnett
just
two
and
years
the
letter
was
read
aloud
by
burnett
to
her
husband
at
the
breakfast
table
the
second
day
after
christmas
from
start
to
finish
it
was
upon
one
subject
and
it
read
as
follows
dear
nan
it
a
confounded
shame
that
not
a
soul
of
us
all
got
home
for
christmas
except
yours
truly
and
he
only
for
a
couple
of
hours
what
have
the
blessed
old
folks
done
to
us
that
we
treat
them
like
this
i
was
invited
to
the
sewalls
for
the
day
and
went
of
course
you
know
why
we
had
a
ripping
time
but
along
toward
evening
i
began
to
feel
worried
i
really
thought
ralph
was
home
he
wrote
me
that
he
might
swing
round
that
way
by
the
holidays
but
i
knew
the
rest
of
you
were
all
wrapped
up
in
your
own
christmas
trees
and
were
going
to
get
there
well
i
took
the
down
and
walked
in
on
them
sitting
all
alone
by
the
fire
by
george
just
like
the
pictures
you
see
of
the
birds
all
flown
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
felt
gulpish
in
my
throat
on
my
honour
i
did
when
i
looked
at
them
mother
just
gave
one
gasp
and
flew
into
my
arms
and
dad
got
up
more
slowly
he
has
that
darned
rheumatism
worse
than
ever
this
winter
and
came
over
and
i
thought
he
shake
my
hand
off
well
i
sat
down
between
them
by
the
fire
and
pretty
soon
i
got
down
in
the
old
way
on
a
cushion
by
mother
and
let
her
run
her
fingers
through
my
hair
the
way
she
used
to
and
nan
i
be
indicted
for
perjury
if
her
hand
was
trembly
they
were
so
glad
to
see
me
it
made
my
throat
ache
ralph
had
written
he
could
get
round
and
of
course
all
written
and
sent
them
things
jolly
things
and
they
appreciated
them
but
blame
it
all
they
were
just
dead
lonesome
and
the
whole
outfit
of
us
within
three
hundred
miles
most
within
thirty
nan
next
christmas
it
going
to
be
different
that
all
i
say
i
got
it
all
planned
out
the
idea
popped
into
my
head
when
i
came
away
last
night
not
that
they
had
a
word
of
blame
not
they
they
understood
all
about
the
children
and
the
cold
snap
and
ed
being
under
the
weather
and
oliver
wife
neuralgia
and
ralph
girl
in
the
west
and
all
that
but
that
did
make
the
thing
any
easier
for
them
as
i
say
next
year
but
you
all
hear
from
me
then
meanwhile
run
down
and
see
them
once
or
twice
this
winter
will
you
nan
somehow
it
struck
me
they
are
so
young
as
they
used
to
be
splendid
winter
weather
margaret
sewall
a
peach
but
i
do
seem
to
make
much
headway
my
best
to
sam
your
affectionate
brother
guy
gay
nan
had
felt
a
slight
choking
in
her
own
throat
as
she
read
this
letter
we
really
must
make
an
effort
to
be
there
christmas
next
year
sam
she
said
to
her
husband
and
sam
assented
cheerfully
he
only
wished
there
were
a
father
and
mother
somewhere
in
the
world
for
him
to
go
home
to
guy
wrote
the
same
sort
of
thing
with
more
or
less
detail
to
edson
and
oliver
his
married
elder
brothers
to
ralph
his
unmarried
brother
and
to
carolyn
charles
wetmore
his
other
and
elder
married
sister
he
received
varied
and
more
or
less
sympathetic
responses
to
the
effect
that
with
so
many
little
children
and
such
snowdrifts
as
always
blocked
the
roads
leading
toward
north
estabrook
it
really
was
not
strange
and
of
course
somebody
would
go
next
year
but
they
had
all
sent
the
nicest
gifts
they
could
find
did
guy
think
mother
liked
those
beautiful
russian
sables
ralph
sent
her
and
was
father
pleased
with
his
cane
from
oliver
surely
with
such
presents
pouring
in
from
all
the
children
father
and
mother
fernald
could
feel
so
awfully
neglected
cane
be
hanged
guy
exploded
when
he
read
this
last
sentence
from
the
letter
of
marian
oliver
wife
i
bet
she
put
him
up
to
it
if
anybody
dares
give
me
a
cane
before
i
thrash
him
with
it
on
the
spot
he
was
using
it
either
bless
him
he
had
his
old
hickory
stick
and
he
would
have
had
that
if
that
abominable
rheumatism
had
gripped
him
so
hard
he
is
old
enough
to
use
a
cane
by
jolly
and
ol
ought
to
know
it
if
marian
does
i
glad
i
sent
him
that
typewriter
he
liked
that
i
know
he
did
and
it
amuse
him
too
not
make
him
think
he
ready
to
die
guy
was
not
the
fellow
to
forget
anything
which
had
taken
hold
of
him
as
that
pathetic
christmas
had
done
when
the
year
had
nearly
rolled
around
the
first
of
december
saw
him
at
work
getting
his
plans
in
train
he
began
with
his
eldest
brother
oliver
because
he
considered
oliver
the
hardest
proposition
he
had
to
tackle
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
idea
you
see
he
expounded
patiently
as
they
sat
and
stared
at
him
it
is
that
they
are
always
awfully
glad
to
see
the
whole
outfit
children
and
all
but
it
just
struck
me
it
would
do
a
lot
of
good
to
revive
old
times
i
thought
if
we
could
make
it
just
as
much
as
possible
like
one
of
the
old
christmases
before
anybody
got
married
hang
up
the
stockings
and
all
you
know
it
would
give
them
a
mighty
jolly
surprise
i
plan
to
have
us
all
creep
in
in
the
night
and
go
to
bed
in
our
old
rooms
and
then
in
the
morning
see
oliver
looked
at
him
an
eager
flush
lit
his
still
boyish
face
guy
was
and
his
blue
eyes
were
very
bright
his
lithe
muscular
figure
bent
toward
her
pleadingly
all
his
arguments
were
aimed
at
her
oliver
sat
back
in
his
impassive
way
and
watched
them
both
it
could
not
be
denied
that
it
was
marian
decisions
which
usually
ruled
in
matters
of
this
sort
it
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
plan
was
oliver
comment
when
guy
had
laid
the
whole
thing
before
her
in
the
most
tactful
manner
he
could
command
she
spoke
rather
coldly
it
is
not
usual
to
think
that
families
should
be
broken
up
like
this
on
christmas
day
of
all
days
in
the
year
four
families
with
somebody
gone
a
mother
or
a
father
just
to
please
two
elderly
people
who
expect
nothing
of
the
sort
and
who
understand
just
why
we
ca
all
get
home
at
once
you
think
you
are
really
asking
a
good
deal
guy
kept
his
temper
though
it
was
hard
work
it
does
seem
to
me
i
am
he
answered
quite
gently
it
only
for
once
i
really
think
father
and
mother
would
care
much
what
sort
of
presents
we
brought
them
if
we
only
came
ourselves
of
course
i
know
i
asking
a
sacrifice
of
each
family
and
it
may
seem
almost
an
insult
not
to
invite
the
children
and
all
yet
perhaps
next
year
we
try
a
gathering
of
all
the
clans
but
just
for
this
year
honestly
i
do
awfully
wish
you
give
me
my
way
if
you
seen
those
two
last
christmas
he
broke
off
glancing
appealingly
at
oliver
himself
to
his
surprise
that
gentleman
shifted
his
pipe
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
put
a
few
pertinent
questions
to
his
younger
brother
had
he
thought
it
all
out
what
time
should
they
arrive
there
how
early
on
the
day
after
christmas
could
they
get
away
was
he
positive
they
could
all
crowd
into
the
house
without
rousing
and
alarming
the
pair
sure
thing
guy
declared
quickly
marietta
well
you
know
had
the
soft
side
of
her
old
heart
ever
since
i
was
born
somehow
i
talked
it
all
over
with
her
last
year
and
i
solid
with
her
all
right
she
work
the
game
you
see
father
quite
a
bit
deaf
now
father
deaf
sure
did
you
know
it
forgotten
but
mother
hear
us
no
she
would
do
you
know
how
she
trusts
everything
about
the
house
to
marietta
since
she
got
that
fall
mother
get
a
fall
why
guy
stared
at
his
brother
with
some
impatience
you
remember
she
fell
down
the
back
stairs
a
year
ago
last
october
and
hurt
her
knee
certainly
oliver
his
wife
interposed
i
wrote
for
you
to
tell
her
how
sorry
we
were
but
i
supposed
she
had
entirely
recovered
she
a
little
bit
lame
and
always
will
be
said
guy
a
touch
of
reproach
in
his
tone
her
knee
stiffens
up
in
the
night
and
she
does
get
up
and
go
prowling
about
at
the
least
noise
the
way
she
used
to
marietta
wo
let
her
so
if
we
make
a
whisper
of
noise
marietta
tell
her
it
the
cat
or
something
good
lord
yes
it
can
be
worked
all
right
the
only
thing
that
worries
me
is
the
fear
that
i
ca
get
you
all
to
take
hold
of
the
scheme
on
my
word
ol
he
turned
quite
away
from
his
critical
gaze
and
faced
his
brother
with
something
like
indignation
in
his
frank
young
eyes
do
we
owe
the
old
home
anything
but
a
present
tied
up
in
tissue
paper
once
a
year
marian
began
to
speak
she
thought
guy
was
exceeding
his
rights
in
talking
as
if
they
had
been
at
fault
it
was
not
often
that
elderly
people
had
so
many
children
within
call
loyal
children
who
would
do
anything
within
reason
but
certainly
a
man
owed
something
to
his
own
family
and
at
christmas
why
not
carry
out
this
plan
at
some
other
her
husband
abruptly
interrupted
her
he
took
his
pipe
quite
out
of
his
mouth
and
spoke
decidedly
guy
i
believe
you
right
i
be
sorry
to
desert
my
own
kids
of
course
but
i
rather
think
they
can
stand
it
for
once
if
the
others
fall
into
line
you
may
count
on
me
guy
got
away
feeling
that
the
worst
of
his
troubles
was
over
in
his
younger
sister
nan
he
hoped
to
find
an
ardent
ally
and
he
was
not
disappointed
carolyn
charles
wetmore
also
fell
in
heartily
with
the
plan
ralph
from
somewhere
in
the
far
west
wrote
that
he
would
get
home
or
break
a
leg
edson
thought
the
idea
rather
a
foolish
one
but
was
persuaded
by
jessica
his
wife
whom
guy
privately
declared
a
trump
that
he
must
go
by
all
means
and
so
they
all
fell
into
line
and
there
remained
for
guy
only
the
working
out
of
the
details
mis
fernald
marietta
cooley
strove
with
all
the
decision
of
which
she
was
capable
to
keep
her
voice
in
order
you
get
to
bed
i
most
forgettin
what
i
was
to
ask
you
i
you
laugh
but
guy
he
wrote
me
he
wanted
you
and
his
father
to
marietta
rather
stern
thin
face
took
on
a
curious
expression
to
hang
up
your
stockin
fernald
paused
in
the
of
the
bedroom
opening
from
the
downstairs
she
looked
back
at
marietta
with
her
gentle
smile
guy
wrote
that
she
asked
then
it
almost
looks
as
if
he
might
be
coming
himself
does
it
marietta
well
i
do
know
i
really
expect
him
marietta
replied
turning
her
face
away
and
busying
herself
about
the
hearth
i
guess
what
he
meant
was
more
in
the
way
of
a
surprise
for
a
christmas
present
something
that
go
into
a
stockin
maybe
it
rather
odd
he
should
have
written
you
to
ask
me
mused
fernald
as
she
looked
out
the
stockings
marietta
considered
rapidly
well
i
he
intended
for
me
to
get
on
the
sly
without
mentionin
it
to
you
an
put
in
what
he
sent
but
i
sort
of
guessed
you
might
like
to
fall
in
with
his
idee
by
hangin
up
yourself
here
by
the
chimbley
where
the
children
all
used
to
do
it
here
the
nails
same
as
they
always
was
fernald
found
the
stockings
and
touched
her
husband
on
the
shoulder
as
he
sat
unlacing
his
shoes
father
guy
wrote
he
wanted
us
to
hang
up
our
stockings
she
said
raising
her
voice
a
little
and
speaking
very
distinctly
the
elderly
man
beside
her
looked
up
smiling
well
well
he
said
anything
to
please
the
boy
it
does
seem
more
than
a
year
since
he
was
a
little
fellow
hanging
up
his
own
stocking
does
it
mother
the
stockings
were
hung
in
silence
they
looked
thin
and
lonely
as
they
dangled
beside
the
dying
fire
marietta
hastened
to
make
them
less
lonely
well
she
said
in
a
way
the
silly
boy
said
i
was
to
hang
mine
too
goodness
knows
what
he
find
to
put
into
it
that
fit
it
a
poker
they
smiled
kindly
at
her
wished
her
good
night
and
went
back
into
their
own
room
the
little
episode
had
aroused
no
suspicions
it
was
very
like
guy
affectionate
boyishness
i
presume
he
be
down
said
fernald
as
she
limped
quietly
about
the
room
making
ready
for
bed
do
you
remember
how
he
surprised
us
last
year
i
sorry
the
others
ca
come
of
course
i
sent
them
all
the
invitation
just
as
usual
i
shall
always
do
that
but
it
pretty
snowy
weather
and
i
suppose
they
do
quite
like
to
risk
it
presently
as
she
was
putting
out
the
light
she
heard
marietta
at
the
door
mis
fernald
peter
piper
got
back
in
this
part
o
the
house
somehow
and
i
ca
lay
hands
on
him
beats
all
how
cute
that
cat
is
seem
if
he
knows
when
i
goin
to
put
him
out
in
the
i
do
think
likely
he
do
no
harm
but
i
thought
i
tell
you
so
you
heard
any
queer
noises
in
the
night
you
know
it
was
peter
very
well
marietta
the
soft
voice
came
back
to
the
schemer
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
peter
will
be
all
right
wherever
he
is
i
sha
be
alarmed
if
i
hear
him
all
right
mis
fernald
i
just
thought
i
let
you
know
and
the
guileful
one
went
grinning
away
was
a
long
silence
in
the
quiet
then
out
of
the
darkness
came
this
little
colloquy
emeline
you
are
getting
to
sleep
i
know
i
not
john
i
christmas
eve
keeps
one
awake
somehow
it
always
did
yes
i
do
suppose
the
children
realise
at
all
do
they
oh
no
oh
no
they
do
realise
they
never
will
till
here
themselves
it
all
right
i
think
i
think
at
least
guy
will
be
down
do
you
i
guess
maybe
he
will
then
after
a
short
silence
mother
got
me
you
know
you
know
you
always
got
me
dear
yes
she
would
not
let
him
hear
the
sob
in
her
voice
she
crept
close
and
spoke
cheerfully
in
his
best
ear
and
you
got
me
johnny
boy
thank
the
lord
i
have
counting
their
blessings
they
fell
asleep
at
last
but
even
in
sleep
one
set
of
lashes
was
strangely
christopher
jinks
what
a
drift
lucky
we
were
two
hours
later

might
hear
us

laughing
or
i
drop

neck

the

the
endeavour

a
sigh
of
content

up

back
stairs
they
pleaded
for
mercy
and
hot
food
they
got
it
everything
that
could
be
had
that
would
diffuse
no
odour
of
cookery
through
the
house
smoking
a
great
pot
of
baked
beans
cold
meats
and
jellies
they
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
their
reception
they
ate
hungrily
with
the
appetites
of
winter
travel
say
but
this
is
great
exulted
ralph
the
stalwart
consuming
a
huge
wedge
of
mince
pie
with
a
fine
disregard
for
any
consequences
that
might
overtake
him
this
alone
is
worth
it
i
have
eaten
such
pie
in
a
century
what
a
jolly
place
this
old
kitchen
is
let
have
a
i
have
been

let
me
see
by
jove

some
excuse
for
me
but
what
about
you
people
that
live
near
he
looked
accusingly
about
carolyn
got
up
and
came
around
to
him
do
talk
about
it
she
whispered
we
have
any
of
us
realised
how
long
it
been
we
get
off
to
bed
now
guy
declared
rising
i
ca
get
over
the
feeling
that
they
may
catch
us
down
here
if
either
of
them
should
want
some
hot
water
or
anything
the
door
bolted
marietta
assured
him
but
it
might
need
explainin
if
i
had
to
bring
hot
water
by
way
of
the
parlour
now
go
awful
careful
up
them
stairs
they
pretty
near
over
your
ma
head
but
i
do
dare
have
you
tramp
through
the
to
the
front
ones
now
remember
that
seventh
stair
creaks
like
ned
you
got
to
step
right
on
the
outside
edge
of
it
to
keep
it
quiet
i
do
know
but
what
you
boys
better
step
right
up
over
that
seventh
stair
without
touchin
foot
to
it
all
right
we
step
who
going
to
fix
the
bundles
carolyn
paused
to
ask
as
she
started
up
the
stairs
marietta
guy
answered
i
labeled
every
one
so
it
be
easy
if
they
hear
paper
rattle
they
think
it
the
usual
presents
sent
on
and
if
they
come
out
they
see
marietta
so
it
all
right
quiet
now
remember
the
seventh
stair
they
crept
up
one
by
one
each
to
his
or
her
old
room
there
needed
to
be
no
doubling
up
for
the
house
was
large
and
each
room
had
been
left
precisely
as
its
owner
had
left
it
it
was
rather
ghostly
this
stealing
silently
about
with
candles
and
in
the
necessity
for
the
suppression
of
speech
the
animation
of
the
party
rather
suffered
eclipse
it
was
late
and
they
were
beginning
to
be
sleepy
so
they
were
soon
in
bed
but
somehow
once
composed
for
slumber
more
than
one
grew
wakeful
again
guy
lying
staring
at
a
patch
of
wintry
moonlight
on
the
odd
striped
paper
of
his
wall
it
had
stopped
snowing
since
they
had
come
into
the
house
and
the
clouds
had
broken
away
leaving
a
brilliant
sky
discovered
his
door
to
be
softly
opening
the
glimmer
of
a
candle
filtered
through
the
crack
a
voice
whispered
his
name
who
is
it
he
answered
under
his
breath
it
nan
may
i
come
in
of
course
what
up

talk

minute
she

noiselessly
in

in
a
woolly
scarlet
kimono

slippers
on
her
feet
her
brown
braids
hanging
down
her
back
the
lately
on
her
cheeks
had
melted
into
a
ruddy
glow
her
eyes
were
stars
she
set
her
candle
on
the
little
stand
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
guy
bed
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
lay
looking
appreciatively
at
her
this

good
night
good
night
christmas
morning
breaking
upon
a
wintry
world
the
star
in
the
east
long
set
outside
the
house
a
great
silence
of
hill
and
plain
inside
a
crackling
fire
upon
a
wide
hearth
and
a
pair
of
elderly
people
waking
to
a
lonely
holiday
illustration
children
she
was
saying
they
john
they
must
be
here
fernald
crept
to
the
door
of
her
room
the
injured
knee
always
made
walking
difficult
after
a
night
quiet
she
meant
to
sit
down
by
the
fire
which
she
had
lately
heard
marietta
stirring
and
feeding
into
activity
and
warm
herself
at
its
flame
she
remembered
with
a
sad
little
smile
that
she
and
john
had
hung
their
stockings
there
and
looked
to
see
what
miracle
had
been
wrought
in
the
night
her
voice
caught
in
her
throat
what
was
all
this
by
some
mysterious
influence
her
husband
learned
that
she
was
calling
him
though
he
had
not
really
heard
he
came
to
the
door
and
looked
at
her
then
at
the
chimneypiece
where
the
stockings
hung
a
long
row
of
them
as
they
had
not
hung
since
the
children
grew
up
stockings
of
quality
one
of
brown
silk
nan
a
fine
gray
sock
with
scarlet
clocks
ralph
all
stuffed
to
the
top
with
bundles
overflowing
upon
the
chimneypiece
and
even
to
the
floor
below
what
this
what
this
john
fernald
voice
was
puzzled
whose
are
these
he
limped
closer
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
stared
hard
at
a
parcel
protruding
from
the
sock
with
the
scarlet
clocks
christmas
to
ralph
from
he
read
ralph
from
nan
he
repeated
vaguely
his
gaze
turned
to
his
wife
his
eyes
were
wide
like
a
child
but
she
was
getting
to
her
feet
from
the
chair
into
which
she
had
dropped
the
children
she
was
saying
they
they
john
they
must
be
he
followed
her
through
the
chilly
hall
to
the
front
staircase
seldom
used
now
and
up
as
rapidly
as
those
slow
stiff
joints
would
allow
trembling
fernald
pushed
open
the
first
door
at
the
top
a
rumpled
brown
head
raised
itself
from
among
the
pillows
a
pair
of
sleepy
but
affectionate
brown
eyes
smiled
back
at
the
two
faces
peering
in
and
a
voice
brimful
of
mirth
cried
softly
merry
christmas
mammy
and
daddy
they
stared
at
her
their
eyes
growing
misty
was
their
little
daughter
nan
not
yet
grown
up
they
could
not
believe
it
even
when
they
had
been
to
every
room
had
seen
their
big
son
ralph
still
sleeping
his
yet
youthful
face
full
of
healthy
colour
pillowed
on
his
brawny
arm
and
his
mother
had
gently
kissed
him
awake
to
be
in
his
hug
when
they
had
met
edson
hearty
laugh
as
he
fired
a
pillow
at
them
carefully
so
that
his
father
could
catch
it
when
they
had
seen
plump
pretty
carol
pulling
on
her
stockings
as
she
sat
on
the
floor
smiling
up
at
them
oliver
advancing
to
meet
them
in
his
and
slippers
guy
holding
out
both
arms
from
above
his
blankets
and
shouting
merry
christmas
and
how
do
you
like
your
children
even
then
it
was
difficult
to
realise
that
not
one
was
missing
and
that
no
one
else
was
there
unconsciously
fernald
found
herself
looking
about
for
the
sons
wives
and
daughters
husbands
and
children
she
loved
them
all
yet
to
have
her
own
and
no
others
just
for
this
one
day
it
was
happiness
indeed
when
they
were
all
downstairs
about
the
fire
there
was
great
rejoicing
they
had
marietta
in
indeed
she
had
been
hovering
continuously
in
the
background
to
the
apparently
frightful
jeopardy
of
the
breakfast
in
preparation
upon
which
nevertheless
she
had
managed
to
keep
a
practised
eye
and
you
were
in
it
marietta
fernald
said
to
her
in
astonishment
when
he
first
saw
her
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
all
these
people
into
the
house
and
to
bed
without
waking
us
it
was
pretty
of
a
resk
marietta
replied
with
modest
pride
as
how
they
was
inclined
to
be
middlin
lively
but
i
kep
up
and
i
filled
up
so
full
of
victuals
they
could
talk
i
did
know
there
be
any
eatables
left
for
she
added
which
last
remark
since
she
had
been
slyly
baking
for
a
week
guy
thought
might
be
considered
pure
bluff
at
the
breakfast
table
while
the
eight
heads
were
bent
this
thanksgiving
arose
as
the
master
of
the
house
in
a
voice
not
quite
steady
offered
it
to
one
unseen
who
camest
to
us
on
that
first
christmas
day
we
bless
thee
for
this
good
and
perfect
gift
thou
sendest
us
that
thou
forgettest
us
not
in
these
later
years
but
givest
us
the
greatest
joy
of
our
lives
in
these
our
loyal
nan
hand
clutched
guy
under
the
table
does
that
make
it
worth
it
his
grasp
said
to
her
and
hers
replied
with
a
frantic
pressure
indeed
it
does
but
we
do
deserve
it
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
a
tremendous
christmas
dinner
well
over
and
the
group
scattered
when
guy
and
his
mother
sat
alone
by
the
fire
the
boys
had
gone
out
to
the
great
stock
barn
with
their
father
to
talk
over
with
him
every
detail
of
the
prosperous
business
he
with
the
help
of
an
invaluable
assistant
was
yet
able
to
manage
carolyn
and
nan
had
ostensibly
gone
with
them
but
in
reality
the
former
was
calling
upon
an
old
friend
of
her
childhood
and
the
latter
had
begged
a
horse
and
sleigh
and
driven
merrily
away
alone
upon
an
errand
she
would
tell
no
one
but
her
mother
illustration
christmas
mammy
and
daddy
fernald
sat
in
her
low
chair
at
the
side
of
the
hearth
her
son
upon
a
cushion
at
her
feet
his
head
resting
against
her
knee
her
slender
fingers
were
gently
threading
the
thick
locks
of
his
hair
as
she
listened
while
he
talked
to
her
of
everything
in
his
life
and
at
last
of
the
one
thing
he
cared
most
about
sometimes
i
get
desperate
and
think
i
may
as
well
give
her
up
for
good
and
all
he
was
saying
she
so
so
i
do
know
any
other
word
for
it
i
never
can
tell
how
i
stand
with
her
going
south
next
week
i
asked
her
to
answer
me
before
she
goes
somehow
i
clung
to
the
hope
that
i
get
my
answer

but
i
left
word
with
my
to
wire
me
if
a
note
or
anything
from

and
i

christmas
day
he
turned
suddenly
and
buried
his
face
in
his
mother
lap
his
shoulders
heaved
a
little
in
spite
of
himself
his
mother
hand
caressed
his
head
more
tenderly
than
ever
but
if
he
could
have
seen
her
eyes
were
very
bright
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
then
suddenly
a
jingle
of
sleigh
bells
approached
through
the
falling
winter
twilight
drew
near
and
stopped
at
the
door
guy
mother
laid
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
son
she
said
there
some
one
stopping
now
perhaps
it
the
boy
with
a
message
from
the
station
he
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
her
eyes
followed
him
as
he
rushed
away
through
the
hall
then
she
rose
and
quietly
closed
the
door
behind
him
as
guy
flung
open
the
front
door
a
tall
and
slender
figure
in
gray
furs
and
a
wide
gray
hat
was
coming
up
the
walk
eyes
whose
glance
had
long
been
his
dearest
torture
met
guy
fernald
and
fell
lips
like
which
there
were
no
others
in
the
world
smiled
tremulously
in
response
to
his
eager
exclamation
and
over
the
piquant
young
face
rose
an
exquisite
colour
which
was
not
altogether
born
of
the
wintry
air
the
girl
who
for
two
years
had
been
only
elusive
had
taken
the
significant
step
of
coming
to
north
estabrook
in
response
to
an
eloquent
telephone
message
sent
that
morning
by
nan
holding
both
her
hands
fast
guy
led
her
up
into
the
house
and
found
himself
alone
with
her
in
the
shadowy
hall
with
one
gay
shout
nan
had
driven
away
toward
the
barn
the
inner
doors
were
all
closed
blessing
the
wondrous
sagacity
of
his
womankind
guy
took
advantage
of
his
moment
nan
brought
you
i
see
that
i
know
you
very
fond
of
her
but
you
did
come
wholly
to
please
her
did
you
margaret
not
wholly
i
been
looking
all
day
for
my
answer
i
oh
i
wonder
if
he
was
gathering
courage
from
her
aspect
which
for
the
first
time
in
his
experience
