chita
a
memory
of
last
island
by
lafcadio
hearn
but
nature
whistled
with
all
her
winds
did
as
she
pleased
and
went
her
way
emerson
to
my
friend
rodolfo
matas
of
new
orleans
contents
the
legend
of
derniere
out
of
the
sea
strength
the
shadow
of
the
tide
the
legend
of
derniere
travelling
south
from
new
orleans
to
the
islands
you
pass
through
a
strange
land
into
a
strange
sea
by
various
winding
waterways
you
can
journey
to
the
gulf
by
lugger
if
you
please
but
the
trip
may
be
made
much
more
rapidly
and
agreeably
on
some
one
of
those
light
narrow
steamers
built
especially
for
which
usually
receive
passengers
at
a
point
not
far
from
the
foot
of
old
street
hard
by
the
where
there
is
ever
a
pushing
and
flocking
of
steam
craft
all
striving
for
place
to
rest
their
white
breasts
against
the
levee
side
by
side
like
great
weary
swans
but
the
miniature
steamboat
on
which
you
engage
passage
to
the
gulf
never
lingers
long
in
the
mississippi
she
crosses
the
river
slips
into
some
labors
along
the
artificial
channel
awhile
and
then
leaves
it
with
a
scream
of
joy
to
puff
her
free
way
down
many
a
league
of
heavily
shadowed
bayou
perhaps
thereafter
she
may
bear
you
through
the
immense
silence
of
drenched
where
the
level
is
broken
at
long
intervals
by
the
black
silhouette
of
some
irrigating
machine
but
whichever
of
the
five
different
routes
be
pursued
you
will
find
yourself
more
than
once
floating
through
sombre
mazes
of
past
assemblages
of
cypresses
all
hoary
with
the
parasitic
tillandsia
and
grotesque
as
gatherings
of
ever
from
river
or
from
lakelet
the
steamer
glides
again
into
canal
or
bayou
from
bayou
or
canal
once
more
into
lake
or
bay
and
sometimes
the
visibly
thins
away
from
these
shores
into
wastes
of
reedy
morass
where
even
of
breathless
nights
the
quaggy
soil
trembles
to
a
sound
like
thunder
of
breakers
on
a
coast
the
of
billions
of
reptile
voices
chanting
in
cadence
rhythmically
surging
in
stupendous
crescendo
and
diminuendo
a
monstrous
and
appalling
chorus
of
frogs
panting
screaming
scraping
her
bottom
over
the
all
day
the
little
steamer
strives
to
reach
the
grand
blaze
of
blue
open
water
below
the
and
perhaps
she
may
be
fortunate
enough
to
enter
the
gulf
about
the
time
of
sunset
for
the
sake
of
passengers
she
travels
by
day
only
but
there
are
other
vessels
which
make
the
journey
also
by
night
threading
the
winter
and
summer
sometimes
steering
by
the
north
star
sometimes
feeling
the
way
with
poles
in
the
white
season
of
fogs
sometimes
again
steering
by
that
star
of
evening
which
in
our
sky
glows
like
another
moon
and
drops
over
the
silent
lakes
as
she
passes
a
quivering
trail
of
silver
fire
shadows
lengthen
and
at
last
the
woods
dwindle
away
behind
you
into
thin
bluish
lines
land
and
water
alike
take
more
luminous
color
bayous
open
into
broad
passes
lakes
link
themselves
with
and
the
bursts
upon
you
keen
cool
and
full
of
light
for
the
first
time
the
vessel
begins
to
swing
rocking
to
the
great
living
pulse
of
the
tides
and
gazing
from
the
deck
around
you
with
no
forest
walls
to
break
the
view
it
will
seem
to
you
that
the
low
land
must
have
once
been
rent
asunder
by
the
sea
and
strewn
about
the
gulf
in
fantastic
tatters
sometimes
above
a
waste
of
you
see
an
oasis
emerging
a
ridge
or
hillock
heavily
umbraged
with
the
rounded
foliage
of
evergreen
oaks
a
cheniere
and
from
the
shining
flood
also
kindred
green
knolls
arise
pretty
islets
each
with
its
of
dazzling
sand
and
shells
and
all
radiant
with
foliage
myrtle
and
palmetto
orange
and
magnolia
under
their
emerald
shadows
curious
little
villages
of
palmetto
huts
are
drowsing
where
dwell
a
swarthy
population
of
orientals
malay
fishermen
who
speak
the
of
the
philippines
as
well
as
their
own
tagal
and
perpetuate
in
louisiana
the
catholic
traditions
of
the
indies
there
are
girls
in
those
unfamiliar
villages
worthy
to
inspire
any
statuary
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
ruddy
bronze
gracile
as
the
palmettoes
that
sway
above
them
further
seaward
you
may
also
pass
a
chinese
settlement
some
queer
camp
of
wooden
dwellings
clustering
around
a
vast
platform
that
stands
above
the
water
upon
a
thousand
piles
over
the
miniature
wharf
you
can
scarcely
fail
to
observe
a
white
painted
with
crimson
ideographs
the
great
platform
is
used
for
drying
fish
in
the
sun
and
the
fantastic
characters
of
the
sign
literally
translated
mean
heap
shrimp
plenty
and
finally
all
the
land
melts
down
into
desolations
of
whose
stillness
is
seldom
broken
except
by
the
melancholy
cry
of
birds
and
in
wild
seasons
by
that
sound
which
shakes
all
shores
when
the
weird
musician
of
the
sea
touches
the
bass
keys
of
his
mighty
organ
ii
beyond
the
a
curious
archipelago
lies
if
you
travel
by
steamer
to
the
you
are
tolerably
certain
to
enter
the
gulf
by
grande
pass
skirting
grande
terre
the
most
familiar
island
of
all
not
so
much
because
of
its
proximity
as
because
of
its
great
crumbling
fort
and
its
graceful
pharos
the
stationary
of
barataria
otherwise
the
place
is
bleakly
uninteresting
a
wilderness
of
grasses
and
sinewy
weeds
waving
away
from
a
thin
beach
ever
speckled
with
drift
and
decaying
things
timbers
dead
porpoises
eastward
the
russet
level
is
broken
by
the
columnar
silhouette
of
the
light
house
and
again
beyond
it
by
some
puny
scrub
timber
above
which
rises
the
angular
ruddy
mass
of
the
old
brick
fort
whose
ditches
swarm
with
crabs
and
whose
sluiceways
are
half
choked
by
obsolete
now
thickly
covered
with
incrustation
of
oyster
shells
around
all
the
gray
circling
of
a
sea
sometimes
of
autumn
evenings
there
when
the
hollow
of
heaven
flames
like
the
interior
of
a
chalice
and
waves
and
clouds
are
flying
in
one
wild
rout
of
broken
gold
you
may
see
the
tawny
grasses
all
covered
with
something
like
husks
husks
large
flat
and
disposed
evenly
along
the
of
each
swaying
stalk
so
as
to
present
only
their
edges
to
the
wind
but
if
you
approach
those
pale
husks
all
break
open
to
display
strange
splendors
of
scarlet
and
with
arabesque
mottlings
in
white
and
black
they
change
into
wondrous
living
blossoms
which
detach
themselves
before
your
eyes
and
rise
in
air
and
flutter
away
by
thousands
to
settle
down
farther
off
and
turn
into
husks
once
more
a
whirling
of
sleepy
butterflies

beautiful

primitively
a
wilderness
of

and
cultivated
by
spanish

now
familiar
chiefly
as

of

its
golden
wealth
of
its
odorous
lanes
of

its
broad
with

camomile
grande

remains
the
prettiest
island
of
the

and
its

is
exceptional
for
the
bleakness

reiterated
by
most
of
the

the
many

more
than
covered
with

and
last
island
derniere
well
worthy
a
long
visit
in
other
years
in
spite
of
its
remoteness
is
now
a
ghastly
desolation
miles
long
lying
nearly
forty
miles
west
of
grande
isle
it
was
nevertheless
far
more
populated
a
generation
ago
it
was
not
only
the
most
celebrated
island
of
the
group
but
also
the
most
fashionable
of
the
aristocratic
south
it
is
visited
by
fishermen
only
at
long
intervals
its
admirable
beach
in
many
respects
resembled
that
of
grande
isle
the
accommodations
also
were
much
similar
although
finer
a
charming
village
of
cottages
facing
the
gulf
near
the
western
end
the
hotel
itself
was
a
massive
construction
of
timber
containing
many
apartments
together
with
a
large
and
in
rear
of
the
hotel
was
a
bayou
where
passengers
landed
village
bayou
it
is
still
called
by
seamen
but
the
deep
channel
which
now
cuts
the
island
in
two
a
little
eastwardly
did
not
exist
while
the
village
remained
the
sea
tore
it
out
in
one
night
the
same
night
when
trees
fields
dwellings
all
vanished
into
the
gulf
leaving
no
vestige
of
former
human
habitation
except
a
few
of
those
strong
brick
props
and
foundations
upon
which
the
frame
houses
and
cisterns
had
been
raised
one
living
creature
was
found
there
after
the
cataclysm
a
cow
but
how
that
solitary
cow
survived
the
fury
of
a
that
actually
rent
the
island
in
twain
has
ever
remained
a
mystery
iii
on
the
gulf
side
of
these
islands
you
may
observe
that
the
trees
when
there
are
any
trees
all
bend
away
from
the
sea
and
even
of
bright
hot
days
when
the
wind
sleeps
there
is
something
grotesquely
pathetic
in
their
look
of
agonized
terror
a
group
of
oaks
at
grande
isle
i
remember
as
especially
suggestive
five
stooping
silhouettes
in
line
against
the
horizon
like
fleeing
women
with
streaming
garments
and
hair
bowing
grievously
and
thrusting
out
arms
desperately
northward
as
to
save
themselves
from
falling
and
they
are
being
pursued
indeed
for
the
sea
is
devouring
the
land
many
and
many
a
mile
of
ground
has
yielded
to
the
tireless
charging
of
ocean
cavalry
far
out
you
can
see
through
a
good
glass
the
porpoises
at
play
where
of
old
the
shook
out
its
million
bannerets
and
now
seam
deep
water
above
a
site
where
pigeons
used
to
coo
men
build
dikes
but
the
besieging
tides
bring
up
their
whole
forests
of
drift
huge
trunks
of
and
weighty
cypress
forever
the
yellow
mississippi
strives
to
build
forever
the
sea
struggles
to
destroy
and
amid
their
eternal
strife
the
islands
and
the
promontories
change
shape
more
slowly
but
not
less
fantastically
than
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
worthy
of
study
are
those
wan
where
the
woods
made
their
last
brave
stand
against
the
irresistible
invasion
usually
at
some
long
point
of
widely
fringed
with
billowing
sand
just
where
the
waves
curl
beyond
such
a
point
you
may
discern
a
multitude
of
blackened
snaggy
shapes
protruding
above
the
water
some
high
enough
to
resemble
ruined
chimneys
others
bearing
a
startling
likeness
to
enormous
and
with
crustaceous
white
growths
clinging
to
them
here
and
there
like
remnants
of
integument
these
are
bodies
and
limbs
of
drowned
oaks
so
long
drowned
that
the
is
upon
parts
of
them
farther
in
upon
the
beach
immense
trunks
lie
overthrown
some
look
like
vast
broken
columns
some
suggest
colossal
torsos
imbedded
and
seem
to
reach
out
mutilated
stumps
in
despair
from
their
deepening
graves
and
beside
these
are
others
which
have
kept
their
feet
with
astounding
obstinacy
although
the
barbarian
tides
have
been
charging
them
for
twenty
years
and
gradually
torn
away
the
soil
above
and
beneath
their
roots
the
sand
around
soft
beneath
and
thinly
crusted
upon
the
surface
is
everywhere
pierced
with
holes
made
by
a
beautifully
mottled
and
crab
with
hairy
legs
big
staring
eyes
and
claws
while
in
the
green
sedges
beyond
there
is
a
perpetual
rustling
as
of
some
strong
wind
beating
among
reeds
a
marvellous
creeping
of
fiddlers
which
the
inexperienced
visitor
might
at
first
mistake
for
so
many
peculiar
beetles
as
they
run
about
sideways
each
with
his
huge
single
claw
folded
upon
his
body
like
a
year
by
year
that
rustling
strip
of
green
land
grows
narrower
the
sand
spreads
and
sinks
shuddering
and
wrinkling
like
a
living
brown
skin
and
the
last
standing
corpses
of
the
oaks
ever
clinging
with
naked
dead
feet
to
the
sliding
beach
lean
more
and
more
out
of
the
perpendicular
as
the
sands
subside
the
stumps
appear
to
creep
their
intertwisted
masses
of
snakish
roots
seem
to
crawl
to
writhe
like
the
reaching
arms
of
cephalopods
grande

grande

is
going
slowly
but
surely
the
gulf
has
eaten
three
miles
into
her
meadowed
land
last
island
has
gone
how
it
went
i
first
heard
from
the
lips
of
a
veteran
pilot
while
we
sat
one
evening
together
on
the
trunk
of
a
drifted
cypress
which
some
high
tide
had
pressed
deeply
into
the
grande
isle
beach
the
day
had
been
tropically
warm
we
had
sought
the
shore
for
a
breath
of
living
air
sunset
came
and
with
it
the
ponderous
heat
lifted
a
sudden
breeze
blew
lightnings
flickered
in
the
darkening
horizon
wind
and
water
began
to
strive
together
and
soon
all
the
low
coast
boomed
then
my
companion
began
his
story
perhaps
the
coming
of
the
storm
inspired
him
to
speak
and
as
i
listened
to
him
listening
also
to
the
clamoring
of
the
coast
there
flashed
back
to
me
recollection
of
a
singular
breton
fancy
that
the
voice
of
the
sea
is
never
one
voice
but
a
tumult
of
many
voices
voices
of
drowned
men
the
muttering
of
multitudinous
dead
the
moaning
of
innumerable
ghosts
all
rising
to
rage
against
the
living
at
the
great
witch
call
of
storms
iv
the
charm
of
a
single
summer
day
on
these
island
shores
is
something
impossible
to
express
never
to
be
forgotten
rarely
in
the
paler
zones
do
earth
and
heaven
take
such
luminosity
those
will
best
understand
me
who
have
seen
the
splendor
of
a
west
indian
sky
and
yet
there
is
a
tenderness
of
tint
a
caress
of
color
in
these
which
is
not
of
the
antilles
a
spirituality
as
of
eternal
tropical
spring
it
must
have
been
to
even
such
a
sky
that
xenophanes
lifted
up
his
eyes
of
old
when
he
vowed
the
infinite
blue
was
god
it
was
indeed
under
such
a
sky
that
de
soto
named
the
vastest
and
grandest
of
southern
havens
espiritu
santo
the
bay
of
the
holy
ghost
there
is
a
something
unutterable
in
this
bright
that
compels
awe
something
vital
something
holy
something
pantheistic
and
reverentially
the
mind
asks
itself
if
what
the
eye
beholds
is
not
the
pneuma
indeed
the
infinite
breath
the
divine
ghost
the
great
blue
soul
of
the
unknown
all
all
is
blue
in
the
calm
save
the
low
land
under
your
feet
which
you
almost
forget
since
it
seems
only
as
a
tiny
green
flake
afloat
in
the
liquid
eternity
of
day
then
slowly
caressingly
irresistibly
the
witchery
of
the
infinite
grows
upon
you
out
of
time
and
space
you
begin
to
dream
with
open
eyes
to
drift
into
delicious
oblivion
of
facts
to
forget
the
past
the
present
the
substantial
to
comprehend
nothing
but
the
existence
of
that
infinite
blue
ghost
as
something
into
which
you
would
wish
to
melt
utterly
away
forever
and
this
of
azure
endures
sometimes
for
months
together
cloudlessly
the
dawn
reddens
up
through
a
violet
east
there
is
no
speck
upon
the
blossoming
of
its
mystical
rose
unless
it
be
the
silhouette
of
some
passing
gull
whirling
his
against
the
crimsoning
ever
as
the
sun
floats
higher
the
flood
shifts
its
color
sometimes
smooth
and
gray
yet
flickering
with
the
morning
gold
it
is
the
vision
of
john
the
apocalyptic
sea
of
glass
mixed
with
fire
again
with
the
growing
breeze
it
takes
that
incredible
purple
tint
familiar
mostly
to
painters
of
west
indian
scenery
once
more
under
the
blaze
of
noon
it
changes
to
a
waste
of
broken
emerald
with
evening
the
horizon
assumes
tints
of
inexpressible
sweetness
opaline
colors
of
milk
and
fire
and
in
the
west
are
and
wondrous
flushings
as
of
nacre
then
if
the
sea
sleeps
it
dreams
of
all
these
faintly
weirdly
shadowing
them
even
to
the
verge
of
heaven
beautiful
too
are
those
white
phantasmagoria
which
at
the
approach
of
equinoctial
days
mark
the
coming
of
the
winds
over
the
rim
of
the
sea
a
bright
cloud
gently
pushes
up
its
head
it
rises
and
others
rise
with
it
to
right
and
left
slowly
at
first
then
more
swiftly
all
are
brilliantly
white
and
flocculent
like
loose
new
cotton
gradually
they
mount
in
enormous
line
high
above
the
gulf
rolling
and
wreathing
into
an
arch
that
expands
and
advances
bending
from
horizon
to
horizon
a
clear
cold
breath
accompanies
its
coming
reaching
the
zenith
it
seems
there
to
hang
poised
awhile
a
ghostly
bridge
arching
the
empyrean
upreaching
its
measureless
span
from
either
underside
of
the
world
then
the
colossal
phantom
begins
to
turn
as
on
a
pivot
of
air
always
preserving
its
curvilinear
symmetry
but
moving
its
unseen
ends
beyond
and
below
the
and
at
last
it
floats
away
unbroken
beyond
the
blue
sweep
of
the
world
with
a
wind
following
after
day
after
day
almost
at
the
same
hour
the
white
arc
rises
wheels
and
passes
never
a
glimpse
of
rock
on
these
low
shores
only
long
sloping
beaches
and
bars
of
smooth
tawny
sand
sand
and
sea
teem
with
vitality
over
all
the
dunes
there
is
a
constant
susurration
a
blattering
and
swarming
of
crustacea
through
all
the
sea
there
is
a
ceaseless
play
of
silver
lightning
flashing
of
myriad
fish
sometimes
the
shallows
are
thickened
with
minute
transparent
organisms
all
colorless
as
gelatine
there
are
days
also
when
countless
medusae
drift
in
beautiful
veined
creatures
that
throb
like
hearts
with
perpetual
systole
and
diastole
of
their
diaphanous
envelops
some
of
translucent
azure
or
rose
seem
in
the
flood
the
shadows
or
ghosts
of
huge
campanulate
flowers
others
have
the
semblance
of
strange
living
vegetables
great
milky
tubers
just
beginning
to
sprout
but
woe
to
the
human
skin
grazed
by
those
shadowy
sproutings
and
spectral
stamens
the
touch
of
glowing
iron
is
not
more
painful
within
an
hour
or
two
after
their
appearance
all
these
tremulous
jellies
vanish
mysteriously
as
they
came
perhaps
if
a
bold
swimmer
you
may
venture
out
alone
a
long
way
once
not
twice
even
in
company
as
the
water
deepens
beneath
you
and
you
feel
those
ascending
of
coldness
arising
which
bespeak
profundity
you
will
also
begin
to
feel
innumerable
touches
as
of
groping
fingers
touches
of
the
bodies
of
fish
innumerable
fish
fleeing
towards
shore
the
farther
you
advance
the
more
thickly
you
will
feel
them
come
and
above
you
and
around
you
to
right
and
left
others
will
leap
and
fall
so
swiftly
as
to
daze
the
sight
like
intercrossing
of
fluid
silver
the
gulls
fly
lower
about
you
circling
with
sinister
squeaking
cries
perhaps
for
an
instant
your
feet
touch
in
the
deep
something
heavy
swift
lithe
that
rushes
past
with
a
swirling
shock
then
the
fear
of
the
abyss
the
vast
and
voiceless
nightmare
of
the
sea
will
come
upon
you
the
silent
panic
of
all
those
opaline
millions
that
flee
glimmering
by
will
enter
into
you
also
from
what
do
they
flee
thus
perpetually
is
it
from
the
giant
sawfish
or
the
ravening
shark
from
the
herds
of
the
porpoises
or
from
the
that
splendid
monster
whom
no
net
may
hold
all
helmed
and
armored
in
argent
or
from
the
hideous
devilfish
of
the
gulf
gigantic
black
with
immense
ever
outspread
like
the
pinions
of
a
bat
the
terror
of
luggermen
the
uprooter
of
anchors
from
all
these
perhaps
and
from
other
monsters
likewise
goblin
shapes
evolved
by
nature
as
destroyers
as
equilibrists
as
counterchecks
to
that
prodigious
fecundity
which
unhindered
would
thicken
the
deep
into
one
measureless
and
waveless
ferment
of
being
but
when
there
are
many
bathers
these
perils
are
forgotten
numbers
give
courage
one
can
abandon
one
self
without
fear
of
the
invisible
to
the
long
quivering
electrical
caresses
of
the
sea
thirty
years
ago
last
island
lay
steeped
in
the
enormous
light
of
even
such
magical
days
july
was
dying
for
weeks
no
fleck
of
cloud
had
broken
the
heaven
blue
dream
of
eternity
winds
held
their
breath
slow
waveless
caressed
the
bland
brown
beach
with
a
sound
as
of
kisses
and
whispers
to
one
who
found
himself
alone
beyond
the
limits
of
the
village
and
beyond
the
hearing
of
its
voices
the
vast
silence
the
vast
light
seemed
full
of
weirdness
and
these
hushes
these
transparencies
do
not
always
inspire
a
causeless
apprehension
they
are
omens
sometimes
omens
of
coming
tempest
nature
incomprehensible
sphinx
before
her
mightiest
bursts
of
rage
ever
puts
forth
her
divinest
witchery
makes
more
manifest
her
awful
beauty
but
in
that
forgotten
summer
the
witchery
lasted
many
long
days
days
born
in
buried
in
gold
it
was
the
height
of
the
season
the
long
village
was
thronged
with
its
summer
population
the
big
hotel
could
hardly
accommodate
all
its
guests
the
were
too
few
for
the
crowds
who
flocked
to
the
water
morning
and
evening
there
were
diversions
for
all
hunting
and
fishing
parties
yachting
excursions
rides
music
games
promenades
carriage
wheels
whirled
flickering
along
the
beach
seaming
its
smoothness
noiselessly
as
if
muffled
love
wrote
its
dreams
upon
the
sand
then
one
great
noon
when
the
blue
abyss
of
day
seemed
to
yawn
over
the
world
more
deeply
than
ever
before
a
sudden
change
touched
the
quicksilver
smoothness
of
the
waters
the
swaying
shadow
of
a
vast
motion
first
the
whole
appeared
to
rise
up
bodily
at
the
sky
the
lifted
to
a
straight
line
the
line
darkened
and
approached
a
monstrous
wrinkle
an
immeasurable
fold
of
green
water
moving
swift
as
a
pursued
by
sunlight
but
it
had
looked
formidable
only
by
startling
contrast
with
the
previous
placidity
of
the
open
it
was
scarcely
two
feet
high
it
curled
slowly
as
it
neared
the
beach
and
combed
itself
out
in
sheets
of
woolly
foam
with
a
low
rich
roll
of
whispered
thunder
swift
in
pursuit
another
followed
a
third
a
feebler
fourth
then
the
sea
only
swayed
a
little
and
stilled
again
minutes
passed
and
the
immeasurable
heaving
recommenced
one
two
three
four
seven
long
swells
this
time
and
the
gulf
smoothed
itself
once
more
irregularly
the
phenomenon
continued
to
repeat
itself
each
time
with
heavier
billowing
and
briefer
intervals
of
quiet
until
at
last
the
whole
sea
grew
restless
and
shifted
color
and
flickered
green
the
swells
became
shorter
and
changed
form
then
from
horizon
to
shore
ran
one
uninterrupted
heaving
one
vast
green
swarming
of
snaky
shapes
rolling
in
to
hiss
and
flatten
upon
the
sand
yet
no
single
revealed
itself
through
all
the
violet
heights
there
was
no
wind
you
might
have
fancied
the
sea
had
been
upheaved
from
beneath
and
indeed
the
fancy
of
a
seismic
origin
for
a
windless
surge
would
not
appear
in
these
latitudes
to
be
utterly
without
foundation
on
the
fairest
days
a
southeast
breeze
may
bear
you
an
odor
singular
enough
to
startle
you
from
sleep
a
strong
sharp
smell
as
of
and
gazing
at
the
sea
you
might
be
still
more
startled
at
the
sudden
apparition
of
great
oleaginous
patches
spreading
over
the
water
sheeting
over
the
swells
that
is
if
you
had
never
heard
of
the
mysterious
submarine
the
volcanic
fountains
unexplored
that
well
up
with
the
eternal
pulsing
of
the
but
the
of
last
island
knew
there
must
have
been
a
great
blow
somewhere
that
day
still
the
sea
swelled
and
a
splendid
surf
made
the
evening
bath
delightful
then
just
at
sundown
a
beautiful
grew
up
and
arched
the
sky
with
a
single
span
of
cottony
pink
vapor
that
changed
and
deepened
color
with
the
dying
of
the
iridescent
day
and
the
approached
stretched
strained
and
swung
round
at
last
to
make
way
for
the
coming
of
the
gale
even
as
the
light
bridges
that
traverse
the
dreamy
teche
swing
open
when
luggermen
sound
through
their
the
long
bellowing
signal
of
approach
then
the
wind
began
to
blow
with
the
passing
of
july
it
blew
from
the
northeast
clear
cool
it
blew
in
enormous
sighs
dying
away
at
regular
intervals
as
if
pausing
to
draw
breath
all
night
it
blew
and
in
each
pause
could
be
heard
the
answering
moan
of
the
rising
surf
as
if
the
rhythm
of
the
sea
moulded
itself
after
the
rhythm
of
the
air
as
if
the
waving
of
the
water
responded
precisely
to
the
waving
of
the
wind
a
billow
for
every
puff
a
surge
for
every
sigh
the
august
morning
broke
in
a
bright
sky
the
breeze
still
came
cool
and
clear
from
the
northeast
the
waves
were
running
now
at
a
sharp
angle
to
the
shore
they
began
to
carry
fleeces
an
innumerable
flock
of
vague
green
shapes
to
be
despoiled
of
their
ghostly
wool
far
as
the
eye
could
follow
the
line
of
the
beach
all
the
slope
was
white
with
the
great
shearing
of
them
clouds
came
flew
as
in
a
panic
against
the
face
of
the
sun
and
passed
all
that
day
and
through
the
night
and
into
the
morning
again
the
breeze
continued
from
the
north
east
blowing
like
an
equinoctial
gale
then
day
by
day
the
vast
breath
freshened
steadily
and
the
waters
heightened
a
week
later
had
become
perilous
colossal
breakers
were
herding
in
like
moving
twice
the
height
of
a
man
still
the
gale
grew
and
the
billowing
waxed
mightier
and
faster
and
faster
overhead
flew
the
tatters
of
torn
cloud
the
gray
morning
of
the
wanly
lighted
a
surf
that
appalled
the
best
swimmers
the
sea
was
one
wild
agony
of
foam
the
gale
was
rending
off
the
heads
of
the
waves
and
veiling
the
horizon
with
a
fog
of
salt
spray
shadowless
and
gray
the
day
remained
there
were
mad
bursts
of
lashing
rain
evening
brought
with
it
a
sinister
apparition
looming
through
a
in
the
west
a
scarlet
sun
in
a
green
sky
his
sanguine
disk
enormously
magnified
seemed
barred
like
the
body
of
a
belted
planet
a
moment
and
the
crimson
spectre
vanished
and
the
moonless
night
came
then
the
wind
grew
weird
it
ceased
being
a
breath
it
became
a
voice
moaning
across
the
world
hooting
uttering
nightmare
sounds
whoo
whoo
whoo
and
with
each
stupendous
the
mooing
of
the
waters
seemed
to
deepen
more
and
more
abysmally
through
all
the
hours
of
darkness
from
the
northwest
the
breakers
of
the
bay
began
to
roll
high
over
the
sandy
slope
into
the
salines
the
village
bayou
broadened
to
a
bellowing
flood
so
the
tumult
swelled
and
the
turmoil
heightened
until
morning
a
morning
of
gray
gloom
and
whistling
rain
rain
of
bursting
clouds
and
rain
of
brine
from
the
great
spuming
agony
of
the
sea
the
steamer
star
was
due
from
mary
that
fearful
morning
could
she
come
no
one
really
believed
it
no
one
and
nevertheless
men
struggled
to
the
roaring
beach
to
look
for
her
because
hope
is
stronger
than
reason
even
today
in
these
creole
islands
the
advent
of
the
steamer
is
the
great
event
of
the
week
there
are
no
telegraph
lines
no
telephones
the
is
the
only
trustworthy
medium
of
communication
with
the
outer
world
bringing
friends
news
letters
the
magic
of
steam
has
placed
new
orleans
nearer
to
new
york
than
to
the
timbaliers
nearer
to
washington
than
to
wine
island
nearer
to
chicago
than
to
barataria
bay
and
even
during
the
deepest
sleep
of
waves
and
winds
there
will
come
betimes
to
sojourners
in
this
unfamiliar
archipelago
a
feeling
of
lonesomeness
that
is
a
fear
a
feeling
of
isolation
from
the
world
of
men
totally
unlike
that
sense
of
solitude
which
haunts
one
in
the
silence
of
or
amid
the
eternal
tumult
of
lofty
granitic
coasts
a
sense
of
helpless
insecurity
the
land
seems
but
an
undulation
of
the
its
highest
ridges
do
not
rise
more
than
the
height
of
a
man
above
the
salines
on
either
side
the
salines
themselves
lie
almost
level
with
the
level
of
the
the
tides
are
variable
treacherous
mysterious
but
when
all
around
and
above
these
shores
the
twin
vastnesses
of
heaven
and
sea
begin
to
utter
the
tremendous
revelation
of
themselves
as
infinite
forces
in
contention
then
indeed
this
sense
of
separation
from
humanity
appalls
perhaps
it
was
such
a
feeling
which
forced
men
on
the
tenth
day
of
august
eighteen
hundred
and
to
hope
against
hope
for
the
coming
of
the
star
and
to
strain
their
eyes
towards
terrebonne
it
was
a
wind
you
could
lie
down
on
said
my
friend
the
pilot
great
god
shrieked
a
voice
above
the
shouting
of
the
storm
she
is
coming
it
was
true
down
the
atchafalaya
and
thence
through
strange
mazes
of
bayou
lakelet
and
pass
by
a
rear
route
familiar
only
to
the
best
of
pilots
the
frail
had
toiled
into
caillou
bay
running
close
to
the
main
shore
and
now
she
was
heading
right
for
the
island
with
the
wind
aft
over
the
monstrous
sea
on
she
came
swaying
rocking
plunging
with
a
great
whiteness
wrapping
her
about
like
a
cloud
and
moving
with
her
moving
a
of
spray
and
like
a
ghost
she
came
for
her
exhaled
no
visible
smoke
the
wind
devoured
it
the
excitement
on
shore
became
wild
men
shouted
themselves
hoarse
women
laughed
and
cried
every
telescope
and
was
directed
upon
the
coming
apparition
all
wondered
how
the
pilot
kept
his
feet
all
marvelled
at
the
madness
of
the
captain
but
captain
abraham
smith
was
not
mad
a
veteran
american
sailor
he
had
learned
to
know
the
great
gulf
as
scholars
know
deep
books
by
heart
he
knew
the
birthplace
of
its
tempests
the
mystery
of
its
tides
the
omens
of
its
hurricanes
while
lying
at
brashear
city
he
felt
the
storm
had
not
yet
reached
its
highest
vaguely
foresaw
a
mighty
peril
and
resolved
to
wait
no
longer
for
a
lull
boys
he
said
we
got
to
take
her
out
in
spite
of
hell
and
they
took
her
out
through
all
the
peril
his
men
stayed
by
him
and
obeyed
him
by
midmorning
the
wind
had
deepened
to
a
roar
lowering
sometimes
to
a
rumble
sometimes
bursting
upon
the
ears
like
a
measureless
and
deafening
crash
then
the
captain
knew
the
star
was
running
a
race
with
death
she
win
it
he
muttered
she
stand
it
perhaps
they
have
need
of
me
she
won
with
a
sonorous
of
triumph
the
brave
little
vessel
rode
at
last
into
the
bayou
and
anchored
hard
by
her
accustomed
in
full
view
of
the
hotel
though
not
near
enough
to
shore
to
lower
her
but
she
had
sung
her
gathering
in
from
the
northeast
the
waters
of
the
bay
were
already
marbling
over
the
salines
and
half
across
the
island
and
still
the
wind
increased
its
paroxysmal
power
cottages
began
to
rock
some
slid
away
from
the
solid
props
upon
which
they
rested
a
chimney
fumbled
shutters
were
wrenched
off
verandas
demolished
light
roofs
lifted
dropped
again
and
flapped
into
ruin
trees
bent
their
heads
to
the
earth
and
still
the
storm
grew
louder
and
blacker
with
every
passing
hour
the
star
rose
with
the
rising
of
the
waters
dragging
her
anchor
two
more
anchors
were
put
out
and
still
she
dragged
dragged
in
with
the
flood
twisting
shuddering
careening
in
her
agony
evening
fell
the
sand
began
to
move
with
the
wind
stinging
faces
like
a
continuous
fire
of
fine
shot
and
frenzied
blasts
came
to
buffet
the
steamer
forward
sideward
then
one
of
her
parted
with
a
clang
like
the
boom
of
a
big
bell
then
another
then
the
captain
bade
his
men
to
cut
away
all
her
upper
works
clean
to
the
deck
overboard
into
the
seething
went
her
stacks
her
her
cabins
and
whirled
away
and
the
naked
hull
of
the
star
still
dragging
her
three
anchors
labored
on
through
the
darkness
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
immense
silhouette
of
the
hotel
whose
hundred
windows
were
now
all
aflame
the
vast
timber
building
seemed
to
defy
the
storm
the
wind
roaring
round
its
broad
verandas
hissing
through
every
crevice
with
the
sound
and
force
of
steam
appeared
to
waste
its
rage
and
in
the
between
two
terrible
gusts
there
came
to
the
captain
ears
a
sound
that
seemed
strange
in
that
night
of
multitudinous
terrors
a
sound
of
music
vi
almost
every
evening
throughout
the
season
there
had
been
dancing
in
the
great
hall
there
was
dancing
that
night
also
the
population
of
the
hotel
had
been
augmented
by
the
advent
of
families
from
other
parts
of
the
island
who
found
their
summer
cottages
insecure
places
of
shelter
there
were
nearly
four
hundred
guests
assembled
perhaps
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
entertainment
had
been
prepared
upon
a
grander
plan
than
usual
that
it
assumed
the
form
of
a
fashionable
ball
and
all
those
pleasure
seekers
representing
the
wealth
and
beauty
of
the
creole
parishes
whether
from
ascension
or
assumption
mary
or
landry
iberville
or
terrebonne
whether
inhabitants
of
the
and
creole
quarter
of
the
quaint
metropolis
or
dwellers
in
the
dreamy
paradises
of
the
teche
mingled
joyously
knowing
each
other
feeling
in
some
sort
akin
whether
affiliated
by
blood
connaturalized
by
caste
or
simply
interassociated
by
traditional
sympathies
of
class
sentiment
and
class
interest
perhaps
in
the
more
than
ordinary
merriment
of
that
evening
something
of
nervous
exaltation
might
have
been
discerned
something
like
a
feverish
resolve
to
oppose
apprehension
with
gayety
to
combat
uneasiness
by
diversion
but
the
hours
passed
in
mirthfulness
the
first
general
feeling
of
depression
began
to
weigh
less
and
less
upon
the
guests
they
had
found
reason
to
confide
in
the
solidity
of
the
massive
building
there
were
no
positive
terrors
no
outspoken
fears
and
the
new
conviction
of
all
had
found
expression
in
the
words
of
the
host
himself
il
a
rien
de
mieux
a
faire
que
de
of
what
avail
to
lament
the
prospective
devastation
of
to
discuss
the
possible
ruin
of
crops
better
to
seek
solace
in
choregraphic
harmonies
in
the
rhythm
of
gracious
motion
and
of
perfect
melody
than
hearken
to
the
discords
of
the
wild
orchestra
of
storms
wiser
to
admire
the
grace
of
parisian
toilets
the
eddy
of
trailing
robes
with
its
of
lace
the
ivorine
loveliness
of
glossy
shoulders
and
jewelled
throats
the
glimmering
of
feet
than
to
watch
the
raging
of
the
flood
without
or
the
flying
of
the
wrack
so
the
music
and
the
mirth
went
on
they
made
joy
for
themselves
those
elegant
guests
they
jested
and
sipped
rich
wines
they
pledged
and
hoped
and
loved
and
promised
with
never
a
thought
of
the
morrow
on
the
night
of
the
tenth
of
august
eighteen
hundred
and
observant
parents
were
there
planning
for
the
future
bliss
of
their
nearest
and
dearest
mothers
and
fathers
of
handsome
lads
lithe
and
elegant
as
young
pines
and
fresh
from
the
polish
of
foreign
university
training
mothers
and
fathers
of
splendid
girls
whose
simplest
attitudes
were
witcheries
young
cheeks
flushed
young
hearts
fluttered
with
an
emotion
more
puissant
than
the
excitement
of
the
dance
young
eyes
betrayed
the
happy
secret
discreeter
lips
would
have
preserved
circled
through
the
aristocratic
press
bearing
dainties
and
wines
praying
permission
to
pass
in
terms
at
once
humble
and
officious
always
in
the
excellent
french
which
were
taught
to
use
on
such
occasions
night
wore
on
still
the
shining
floor
palpitated
to
the
feet
of
the
dancers
still
the
pealed
and
still
the
violins
sang
and
the
sound
of
their
singing
shrilled
through
the
darkness
in
gasps
of
the
gale
to
the
ears
of
captain
smith
as
he
strove
to
keep
his
footing
on
the
deck
of
the
star
christ
he
muttered
a
dance
if
that
wind
whips
round
south
there
be
another
dance
but
i
guess
the
star
will
stay
half
an
hour
might
have
passed
still
the
lights
flamed
calmly
and
the
violins
trilled
and
the
perfumed
whirl
went
on
and
suddenly
the
wind
veered
again
the
star
reeled
and
shuddered
and
turned
and
began
to
drag
all
her
anchors
but
she
now
dragged
away
from
the
great
building
and
its
lights
away
from
the
voluptuous
thunder
of
the
grand
piano
even
at
that
moment
outpouring
the
great
joy
of

orchestrated
by

from

he
came
whirling
the

in

some
one
shrieked
in
the
midst
of
the
revels
some
girl
who
found
her
pretty
slippers
wet
what
could
it
be
thin
streams
of
water
were
spreading
over
the
level
planking
curling
about
the

of

what

all
the

had
begun
to
quake
even
as

a
moment
before
the

floor
was
trembling
to
the
pressure
of
circling
steps
all
the
building
shook
now
every
beam
uttered
its
groan
what
could
it
be
there
was
a
clamor
a
panic
a
rush
to
the
windy
night
infinite
darkness
above
and
beyond
but
the
danced
far
out
over
an
unbroken
circle
of
heaving
and
swirling

stealthily
swiftly
the

was
rising

for

there
was
a
ghastly

and
through
that
hush
there
burst
upon
the
ears
of
all
a
fearful
and
unfamiliar
sound
as
of
a
colossal
cannonade
rolling
up
from
the
south
with
volleying
lightnings
vastly
and
swiftly
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
a
ponderous
and
unbroken
terrible
as
the
long
muttering
of
an

twenty

distant
there
were

but
the

never

then
rose
a
frightful
cry
the
hoarse
hideous
indescribable
cry
of
hopeless
fear
the
despairing
man
utters
when
suddenly
brought
face
to

with
nothingness
without
preparation
without
consolation
without

failed
in

drew
him
aboard

in

there

seems
not
of

of
the
immemorial
past
of
that
epoch
when
low
flat
reaches
of
primordial
continent
first
rose
into
form
above
a
silurian
sea
to
indulge
this
geologic
dream
any
fervid
and
breezeless
day
there
it
is
only
necessary
to
ignore
the
evolutional
protests
of
a
few
blue
asters
or
a
few
composite
flowers
of
the
coryopsis
sort
which
contrive
to
display
their
rare
flashes
of
color
through
the
general
waving
of
wild
cane
and
marsh
grasses
for
at
a
hasty
glance
the
general
appearance
of
this
marsh
verdure
is
vague
enough
as
it
ranges
away
towards
the
sand
to
convey
the
idea
of
amphibious
vegetation
a
primitive
flora
as
yet
undecided
whether
to
retain
marine
habits
and
forms
or
to
assume
terrestrial
ones
and
the
occasional
inspection
of
surprising
shapes
might
strengthen
this
fancy
queer
and
things
which
resemble
in
juiciness
and
color
and
consistency
crackle
under
your
feet
from
time
to
time
the
moist
and
weighty
air
seems
heated
rather
from
below
than
from
above
less
by
the
sun
than
by
the
radiation
of
a
cooling
world
and
the
mists
of
morning
or
evening
appear
to
simulate
the
vapory
exhalation
of
volcanic
forces
latent
but
only
dozing
and
uncomfortably
close
to
the
surface
and
indeed
geologists
have
actually
averred
that
those
rare
elevations
of
the
soil
which
with
their
heavy
coronets
of
evergreen
foliage
not
only
look
like
islands
but
are
so
called
in
the
french
nomenclature
of
the
coast
have
been
prominences
created
by
ancient
mud
volcanoes
the
family
of
a
spanish
fisherman
feliu
viosca
once
occupied
and
gave
its
name
to
such
an
islet
quite
close
to
the
the
loftiest
bit
of
land
along
fourteen
miles
of
just
such
marshy
coast
as
i
have
spoken
of
landward
it
dominated
a
desolation
that
wearied
the
eye
to
look
at
a
wilderness
of
reedy
sloughs
patched
at
intervals
with
ranges
of
tufts
of
and
broad
reaches
of
stretching
away
to
a
line
of
woods
that
closed
the
horizon
and
imperfectly
drained
in
the
driest
season
by
a
slimy
little
bayou
that
continually
vomited
foul
water
into
the
sea
the
point
had
been
much
discussed
by
geologists
it
proved
a
godsend
to
united
states
surveyors
weary
of
attempting
to
take
observations
among
quagmires
moccasins
and
arborescent
weeds
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
high
savage
fishermen
at
some
unrecorded
time
had
heaped
upon
the
eminence
a
hill
of
refuse
of
a
million
feasts
earth
again
had
been
formed
over
these
perhaps
by
the
blind
agency
of
worms
working
through
centuries
unnumbered
and
the
new
soil
had
given
birth
to
a
luxuriant
vegetation
millennial
oaks
interknotted
their
roots
below
its
surface
and
vouchsafed
protection
to
many
a
frailer
growth
of
shrub
or
tree
wild
orange
palmetto
locust
pomegranate
and
many
trailing
tendrilled
things
both
green
and
gray
then
perhaps
about
half
a
century
ago
a
few
white
fishermen
cleared
a
place
for
themselves
in
this
grove
and
built
a
few
palmetto
cottages
with
and
a
wharf
facing
the
bayou
later
on
this
temporary
fishing
station
became
a
permanent
settlement
homes
constructed
of
heavy
timber
and
plaster
mixed
with
the
trailing
moss
of
the
oaks
and
cypresses
took
the
places
of
the
frail
and
fragrant
huts
of
palmetto
still
the
population
itself
retained
a
floating
character
it
ebbed
and
came

viosca
the
founder
of
the
settlement
always
remained
he
always
managed
to
do
well
he
owned
several
luggers
and
sloops
which
were
hired
out
upon
excellent
terms
he
could
make
large
and
profitable
contracts
with
new
orleans
and
he
was
vaguely
suspected
of
possessing
more
occult
resources
there
were
some
confused
stories
current
about
his
having
once
been
a
daring
smuggler
and
having
only
been
reformed
by
the
pleadings
of
his
wife
carmen
a
little
brown
woman
who
had
followed
him
from
barcelona
to
share
his
fortunes
in
the
western
world
on
hot
days
when
the
shade
was
full
of
thin
sweet
scents
the
place
had
a
tropical
charm
a
drowsy
peace
nothing
except
the
peculiar
appearance
of
the
line
of
oaks
facing
the
gulf
could
have
conveyed
to
the
visitor
any
suggestion
of
days
in
which
the
trilling
of
crickets
and
the
fluting
of
birds
had
ceased
of
nights
when
the
voices
of
the
marsh
had
been
hushed
for
fear
in
one
enormous
rank
the
veteran
trees
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
but
in
the
attitude
of
giants
over
mastered
forced
backward
towards
the
marsh
made
to
recoil
by
the
might
of
the
ghostly
enemy
with
whom
they
had
striven
a
thousand
years
the
shrieker
the
the
awful
never
had
he
given
them
so
terrible
a
wrestle
as
on
the
night
of
the
tenth
of
august
eighteen
hundred
and
all
the
waves
of
the
excited
gulf
thronged
in
as
if
to
see
and
lifted
up
their
voices
and
pushed
and
roared
until
the
cheniere
was
islanded
by
such
a
billowing
as
no
white
man
eyes
had
ever
looked
upon
before
grandly
the
oaks
bore
themselves
but
every
fibre
of
their
knotted
thews
was
strained
in
the
unequal
contest
and
two
of
the
giants
were
overthrown
upturning
as
they
fell
roots
coiled
and
huge
as
the
of
titans
moved
to
its
entrails
all
the
islet
trembled
while
the
sea
magnified
its
menace
and
reached
out
whitely
to
the
prostrate
trees
but
the
rest
of
the
oaks
stood
on
and
strove
in
line
and
saved
the
habitations
defended
by
them
ii
before
a
little
waxen
image
of
the
mother
and
child
an
odd
little
virgin
with
an
indian
face
brought
home
by
feliu
as
a
gift
after
one
of
his
mexican
voyages
carmen
viosca
had
burned
candles
and
prayed
sometimes
telling
her
beads
sometimes
murmuring
the
litanies
she
knew
by
heart
sometimes
also
reading
from
a
worn
and
greasy
as
a
pack
of
cards
it
was
particularly
stained
at
one
page
a
page
on
which
her
tears
had
fallen
many
a
lonely
night
a
page
with
a
clumsy
wood
cut
representing
a
celestial
lamp
a
symbolic
radiance
shining
through
darkness
and
on
either
side
a
kneeling
angel
with
folded
wings
and
beneath
this
rudely
wrought
symbol
of
the
perpetual
calm
appeared
in
big
coarse
type
the
title
of
a
prayer
that
has
been
offered
up
through
many
a
century
doubtless
by
wives
of
spanish
mariners
contra
las
tempestades
once
she
became
very
much
frightened
after
a
partial
lull
the
storm
had
suddenly
redoubled
its
force
the
ground
shook
the
house
quivered
and
creaked
the
wind
brayed
and
screamed
and
pushed
and
scuffled
at
the
door
and
the
water
which
had
been
whipping
in
through
every
crevice
all
at
once
rose
over
the
threshold
and
flooded
the
dwelling
carmen
dipped
her
finger
in
the
water
and
tasted
it
it
was
salt
and
none
of
feliu
boats
had
yet
come
in
doubtless
they
had
been
driven
into
some
bayous
by
the
storm
the
only
boat
at
the
settlement
the
carmencita
had
been
almost
wrecked
by
running
upon
a
snag
three
days
before
there
was
at
least
a
fortnight
work
for
the
of
dead
cypress
point
and
feliu
was
sleeping
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
the
heavy
sleep
of
a
sailor
heedless
of
commotions
and
voices
and
his
men
miguel
and
mateo
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
cheniere
with
a
scream
carmen
aroused
feliu
he
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
rubbed
his
eyes
and
asked
her
with
exasperating
calmness
que
tienes
que
tienes
what
ails
thee
oh
feliu
the
sea
is
coming
upon
us
she
answered
in
the
same
tongue
but
she
screamed
out
a
word
inspired
by
her
fear
she
did
not
cry
se
nos
viene
el
mar
encima
but
se
nos
viene
la
altura
the
name
that
conveys
the
terrible
thought
of
depth
swallowed
up
in
height
the
height
of
the
high
sea
no
lo
creo
muttered
feliu
looking
at
the
floor
then
in
a
quiet
deep
voice
he
said
pointing
to
an
oar
in
the
corner
of
the
room
echame
ese
remo
she
gave
it
to
him
still
reclining
upon
one
elbow
feliu
measured
the
depth
of
the
water
with
his
thumb
nail
upon
the
blade
of
the
oar
and
then
bade
carmen
light
his
pipe
for
him
his
calmness
reassured
her
for
half
an
hour
more
undismayed
by
the
clamoring
of
the
wind
or
the
calling
of
the
sea
feliu
silently
smoked
his
pipe
and
watched
his
oar
the
water
rose
a
little
higher
and
he
made
another
mark
then
it
climbed
a
little
more
but
not
so
rapidly
and
he
smiled
at
carmen
as
he
made
a
third
mark
como
creia
he
exclaimed
no
hay
porque
asustarse
el
agua
baja
and
as
carmen
would
have
continued
to
pray
he
rebuked
her
fears
and
bade
her
try
to
obtain
some
rest
basta
ya
de
plegarios
querida
vete
y
duerme
his
tone
though
kindly
was
imperative
and
carmen
accustomed
to
obey
him
laid
herself
down
by
his
side
and
soon
for
very
weariness
slept
it
was
a
feverish
sleep
nevertheless
shattered
at
brief
intervals
by
terrible
sounds
sounds
magnified
by
her
nervous
condition
a
sleep
visited
by
dreams
that
mingled
in
a
strange
way
with
the
impressions
of
the
storm
and
more
than
once
made
her
heart
stop
and
start
again
at
its
own
stopping
one
of
these
fancies
she
never
could
forget
a
dream
about
little
concha
conchita
her
firstborn
who
now
slept
far
away
in
the
old
churchyard
at
barcelona
she
had
tried
to
become
resigned
not
to
think
but
the
child
would
come
back
night
after
night
though
the
earth
lay
heavy
upon
her
night
after
night
through
long
distances
of
time
and
space
oh
the
fancied
clinging
of
the
thrilling
touch
of
little
ghostly
hands
those
that
torture
mothers
hearts
night
after
night
through
many
a
month
of
pain
then
for
a
time
the
gentle
presence
ceased
to
haunt
her
seemed
to
have
lain
down
to
sleep
forever
under
the
high
bright
grass
and
yellow
flowers
why
did
it
return
that
night
of
all
nights
to
kiss
her
to
cling
to
her
to
nestle
in
her
arms
for
in
her
dream
she
thought
herself
still
kneeling
before
the
waxen
image
while
the
terrors
of
the
tempest
were
ever
deepening
about
her
raving
of
winds
and
booming
of
waters
and
a
shaking
of
the
land
and
before
her
even
as
she
prayed
her
the
waxen
virgin
became
tall
as
a
woman
and
taller
rising
to
the
roof
and
smiling
as
she
grew
then
carmen
would
have
cried
out
for
fear
but
that
something
smothered
her
voice
paralyzed
her
tongue
and
the
virgin
silently
stooped
above
her
and
placed
in
her
arms
the
child
the
brown
child
with
the
indian
face
and
the
child
whitened
in
her
hands
and
changed
seeming
as
it
changed
to
send
a
sharp
pain
through
her
heart
an
old
pain
linked
somehow
with
memories
of
bright
windy
spanish
hills
and
summer
scent
of
olive
groves
and
all
the
luminous
past
it
looked
into
her
face
with
the
soft
dark
gaze
with
the
unforgotten
smile
of
dead
conchita
and
carmen
wished
to
thank
the
smiling
virgin
for
that
priceless
bliss
and
lifted
up
her
eyes
but
the
sickness
of
ghostly
fear
returned
upon
her
when
she
looked
for
now
the
mother
seemed
as
a
woman
long
dead
and
the
smile
was
the
smile
of
fleshlessness
and
the
places
of
the
eyes
were
voids
and
darknesses
and
the
sea
sent
up
so
vast
a
roar
that
the
dwelling
rocked
carmen
started
from
sleep
to
find
her
heart
throbbing
so
that
the
couch
shook
with
it
night
was
growing
gray
the
door
had
just
been
opened
and
slammed
again
through
the
panes
she
discerned
the
passing
shape
of
feliu
making
for
the
beach
a
broad
and
bearded
silhouette
bending
against
the
wind
still
the
waxen
virgin
smiled
her
mexican
smile
but
now
she
was
only
seven
inches
high
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
twinkle
with
kindliness
while
the
flame
of
the
last
expiring
taper
struggled
for
life
in
the
earthen
socket
at
her
feet
iii
rain
and
a
blind
sky
and
a
bursting
sea
feliu
and
his
men
miguel
and
mateo
looked
out
upon
the
thundering
and
flashing
of
the
monstrous
tide
the
wind
had
fallen
and
the
gray
air
was
full
of
gulls
behind
the
cheniere
back
to
the
cloudy
line
of
low
woods
many
miles
away
stretched
a
wash
of
water
with
a
green
point
piercing
it
here
and
there
or
wild
cane
tall
enough
to
keep
their
heads
above
the
flood
but
the
inundation
was
visibly
decreasing
with
the
passing
of
each
hour
more
and
more
green
patches
and
points
had
been
showing
themselves
by
degrees
the
course
of
the
bayou
had
become
defined
two
parallel
winding
lines
of
and
bushy
shrubs
traversing
the
water
toward
the
distant
before
the
cheniere
all
the
slope
was
piled
with
wreck
uptorn
trees
with
the
foliage
still
fresh
upon
them
splintered
timbers
of
mysterious
origin
and
logs
in
multitude
scarred
with
gashes
of
the
axe
feliu
and
his
comrades
had
saved
wood
enough
to
build
a
little
town
working
up
to
their
waists
in
the
surf
with
ropes
poles
and
the
whole
sea
was
full
of
flotsam
voto
a
cristo
what
a
wrecking
there
must
have
been
and
to
think
the
carmencita
could
not
be
taken
out
they
had
seen
other
luggers
making
eastward
during
the
morning
could
recognize
some
by
their
sails
others
by
their
gait
exaggerated
in
their
struggle
with
the
pitching
of
the
sea
the
san
pablo
the
gasparina
the
enriqueta
the
agueda
the
constanza
ugly
water
yes
but
what
a
chance
for
wreckers
some
great
ship
must
have
gone
to
pieces
scores
of
casks
were
rolling
in
the
trough
casks
of
wine
perhaps
it
was
the
manila
perhaps
the
nautilus
a
dead
cow
floated
near
enough
for
mateo
to
throw
his
rope
over
one
horn
and
they
all
helped
to
get
it
out
it
was
a
milch
cow
of
some
expensive
breed
and
the
owner
brand
had
been
burned
upon
the
horns
a
monographic
combination
of
the
letters
a
and
feliu
said
he
knew
that
brand
preaulx
of
who
kept
a
sort
of
dairy
at
last
island
during
the
summer
season
used
to
mark
all
his
cows
that
way
strange
but
as
they
worked
on
they
began
to
see
stranger
things
white
dead
faces
and
dead
hands
which
did
not
look
like
the
hands
or
the
faces
of
drowned
sailors
the
ebb
was
beginning
to
run
strongly
and
these
were
passing
out
with
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
bayou
perhaps
they
had
been
washed
into
the
marsh
during
the
night
when
the
great
rush
of
the
sea
came
then
the
three
men
left
the
water
and
retired
to
higher
ground
to
scan
the
furrowed
gulf
their
practiced
eyes
began
to
search
the
courses
of
the
keen
as
the
gaze
of
birds
that
watch
the
wake
of
the
plough
and
soon
the
casks
and
the
drift
were
forgotten
for
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
tide
was
heavy
with
human
dead
passing
out
processionally
to
the
great
open
very
far
where
the
huge
pitching
of
the
swells
was
diminished
by
distance
into
a
mere
fluttering
of
ripples
the
water
appeared
as
if
sprinkled
with
them
they
vanished
and
became
visible
again
at
irregular
intervals
here
and
there
floating
most
thickly
eastward
tossing
swaying
patches
of
white
or
pink
or
blue
or
black
each
with
its
tiny
speck
of
showing
as
the
sea
lifted
or
lowered
the
body
nearer
to
shore
there
were
few
but
of
these
two
were
close
enough
to
be
almost
recognizable
miguel
first
discerned
them
they
were
rising
and
falling
where
the
water
was
deepest
well
out
in
front
of
the
mouth
of
the
bayou
beyond
the
flooded
and
moving
toward
the
westward
they
were
drifting
almost
side
by
side
one
was
that
of
a
negro
apparently
well
attired
and
wearing
a
white
apron
the
other
seemed
to
be
a
young
colored
girl
clad
in
a
blue
dress
she
was
floating
upon
her
face
they
could
observe
that
she
had
nearly
straight
hair
braided
and
tied
with
a
red
ribbon
these
were
evidently
slaves
but
from
whence
nothing
could
be
learned
until
the
luggers
should
return
and
none
of
them
was
yet
in
sight
still
feliu
was
not
anxious
as
to
the
fate
of
his
boats
manned
by
the
best
sailors
of
the
coast
rarely
are
these
louisiana
fishermen
lost
in
sudden
storms
even
when
to
other
eyes
the
appearances
are
most
pacific
and
the
skies
most
splendidly
blue
they
divine
some
danger
like
the
gulls
and
like
the
gulls
also
you
see
their
light
vessels
fleeing
landward
these
men
seem
living
barometers
exquisitely
sensitive
to
all
the
invisible
changes
of
atmospheric
expansion
and
compression
they
are
not
easily
caught
in
those
awful
dead
calms
which
suddenly
paralyze
the
wings
of
a
bark
and
hold
her
helpless
in
their
charmed
circle
as
in
a
nightmare
until
the
blackness
overtakes
her
and
the
sea
leaps
up
foaming
to
devour
her
carajo
the
word
all
at
once
bursts
from
feliu
mouth
with
that
peculiar
guttural
snarl
of
the
r
betokening
strong
excitement
while
he
points
to
something
rocking
in
the
ebb
beyond
the
foaming
of
the
under
a
circling
of
gulls
more
dead
yes
but
something
too
that
lives
and
moves
like
a
quivering
speck
of
gold
and
mateo
also
perceives
it
a
gleam
of
bright
hair
and
miguel
likewise
after
a
moment
gazing
a
living
child
a
lifeless
mother
pobrecita
no
boat
within
reach
and
only
a
mighty
could
hope
to
swim
thither
and
return
but
already
without
a
word
brown
feliu
has
stripped
for
the
struggle
another
second
and
he
is
shooting
through
the
surf
head
and
hands
tunnelling
the
foam
hills
one
two
three
lines
passed
four
that
is
where
they
first
begin
to
crumble
white
from
the
summit
five
that
he
can
ride
fearlessly
then
swiftly
easily
he
advances
with
a
long
powerful
keeping
his
bearded
head
well
up
to
watch
for
drift
seeming
to
slide
with
a
swing
from
swell
to
swell
ascending
sinking
alternately
presenting
breast
or
shoulder
to
the
wave
always
diminishing
more
and
more
to
the
eyes
of
mateo
and
miguel
till
he
becomes
a
moving
speck
occasionally
hard
to
follow
through
the
confusion
of
heaping
waters
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
sharks
feliu
no
they
are
afraid
of
you
right
and
left
they
slunk
away
from
your
coming
that
morning
you
swam
for
life
in
waters
with
your
knife
in
your
teeth
while
the
balls
of
the
cuban
were
purring
all
around
you
that
day
the
swarming
sea
was
warm
warm
like
soup
and
clear
with
an
emerald
flash
in
every
ripple
not
opaque
and
clamorous
like
the
gulf
today
miguel
and
his
comrade
are
anxious
ropes
are
unrolled
and
into
a
line
miguel
remains
on
the
beach
but
mateo
bearing
the
end
of
the
line
fights
his
way
out
swimming
and
wading
by
turns
to
the
further
sandbar
where
the
water
is
shallow
enough
to
stand
in
if
you
know
how
to
jump
when
the
breaker
comes
but
feliu
nearing
the
flooded
watches
the
white
flashings
knows
when
the
time
comes
to
keep
flat
and
take
a
long
long
breath
one
heavy
volleying
of
foam
darkness
and
hissing
as
of
a
a
vibrant
lifting
up
a
rush
into
light
and
again
the
volleying
and
the
seething
darkness
once
more
and
the
fight
is
won
he
feels
the
upcoming
chill
of
deeper
water
sees
before
him
the
green
quaking
of
unbroken
swells
and
far
beyond
him
mateo
leaping
on
the
bar
and
beside
him
almost
within
arm
reach
a
great
swaying
and
a
dead
woman
clinging
there
and
the
child
a
moment
more
and
feliu
has
lifted
himself
beside
the
waifs
how
fast
the
dead
woman
clings
as
if
with
the
one
power
which
is
strong
as
death
the
desperate
force
of
love
not
in
vain
for
the
frail
creature
bound
to
the
mother
corpse
with
a
silken
scarf
has
still
the
strength
to
cry
out
maman
maman
but
time
is
life
now
and
the
tiny
hands
must
be
pulled
away
from
the
fair
dead
neck
and
the
scarf
taken
to
bind
the
infant
firmly
to
feliu
broad
shoulders
quickly
roughly
for
the
ebb
will
not
wait
and
now
feliu
has
a
burden
but
his
style
of
swimming
has
totally
changed
he
rises
from
the
water
like
a
triton
and
his
powerful
arms
seem
to
spin
in
circles
like
the
spokes
of
a
flying
wheel
for
now
is
the
wrestle
indeed
after
each
passing
swell
comes
a
prodigious
pulling
from
beneath
the
sea
clutching
for
its
prey
but
the
reef
is
gained
is
passed
the
wild
horses
of
the
deep
seem
to
know
the
swimmer
who
has
learned
to
ride
them
so
well
and
still
the
brown
arms
spin
in
an
mist
of
spray
and
the
outer
is
not
far
off
and
there
is
shouting
mateo
leaping
in
the
surf
swinging
something
about
his
head
as
a
vaquero
swings
his
noose
sough
splash
it
struggles
in
the
trough
beside
feliu
and
the
sinewy
hand
descends
upon
it
tiene
tira
miguel
and
their
feet
touch
land
again
she
is
very
cold
the
child
and
very
still
with
eyes
closed
esta
muerta
feliu
asks
mateo
no
the
panting
swimmer
makes
answer
emerging
while
the
waves
reach
whitely
up
the
sand
as
in
pursuit
no
vive
respira
todavia
behind
him
the
deep
lifts
up
its
million
hands
and
thunders
as
in
acclaim
iv
madre
de
dios
mi
sueno
screamed
carmen
abandoning
her
preparations
for
the
morning
meal
as
feliu
nude
like
a
marine
god
rushed
in
and
held
out
to
her
a
dripping
and
gasping
mother
of
god
my
dream
but
there
was
no
time
then
to
tell
of
dreams
the
child
might
die
in
one
instant
carmen
quick
deft
hands
had
stripped
the
slender
little
body
and
while
mateo
and
feliu
were
finding
dry
clothing
and
stimulants
and
miguel
telling
how
it
all
happened
quickly
passionately
with
furious
gesture
the
kind
and
vigorous
woman
exerted
all
her
skill
to
revive
the
flickering
life
soon
feliu
came
to
aid
her
while
his
men
set
to
work
completing
the
interrupted
preparation
of
the
breakfast
flannels
were
heated
for
the
friction
of
the
frail
limbs
and
warmed
which
carmen
administered
by
the
spoonful
skilfully
as
any
physician
until
at
last
the
little
creature
opened
her
eyes
and
began
to
sob
sobbing
still
she
was
laid
in
carmen
warm
well
swathed
in
woollen
wrappings
the
immediate
danger
at
least
was
over
and
feliu
smiled
with
pride
and
pleasure
then
carmen
first
ventured
to
relate
her
dream
and
his
face
became
grave
again
husband
and
wife
gazed
a
moment
into
each
other
eyes
feeling
together
the
same
strange
thrill
that
mysterious
faint
creeping
as
of
a
wind
passing
which
is
the
awe
of
the
unknowable
then
they
looked
at
the
child
lying
there
pink
checked
with
the
flush
of
the
blood
returning
and
such
a
sudden
tenderness
touched
them
as
they
had
known
long
years
before
while
together
bending
above
the
slumbering
loveliness
of
lost
conchita
que
ojos
murmured
feliu
as
he
turned
away
feigning
hunger
he
was
not
hungry
but
his
sight
had
grown
a
little
dim
as
with
a
mist
que
ojos
they
were
singular
eyes
large
dark
and
wonderfully
fringed
the
child
hair
was
yellow
it
was
the
flash
of
it
that
had
saved
her
yet
her
eyes
and
brows
were
beautifully
black
she
was
comely
but
with
such
a
curious
delicate
comeliness
totally
unlike
the
robust
beauty
of
concha
at
intervals
she
would
moan
a
little
between
her
sobs
and
at
last
cried
out
with
a
thin
shrill
cry
maman
oh
maman
then
carmen
lifted
her
from
the
bed
to
her
lap
and
caressed
her
and
rocked
her
gently
to
and
fro
as
she
had
done
many
a
night
for
concha
murmuring
yo
sere
tu
madre
angel
mio
dulzura
mia
sere
tu
madrecita
palomita
mia
i
will
be
thy
mother
my
angel
my
sweet
i
will
be
thy
little
mother
my
doveling
and
the
long
silk
fringes
of
the
child
eyes
overlapped
shadowed
her
little
cheeks
and
she
slept
just
as
conchita
had
slept
long
ago
with
her
head
on
carmen
bosom
feliu
at
the
inner
door
at
a
sign
he
approached
cautiously
without
noise
and
looked
she
can
talk
whispered
carmen
in
spanish
she
called
her
mother
ha
llamado
a
su
madre
y
dios
tambien
la
ha
llamado
responded
feliu
with
rude
pathos
and
god
also
called
her
but
the
virgin
sent
us
the
child
feliu
sent
us
the
child
for
concha
sake
he
did
not
answer
at
once
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
very
deeply
carmen
anxiously
scanned
his
impassive
face
who
knows
he
answered
at
last
who
knows
perhaps
she
has
ceased
to
belong
to
any
one
else
one
after
another
feliu
luggers
fluttered
in
bearing
with
them
news
of
the
immense
calamity
and
all
the
fishermen
in
turn
looked
at
the
child
not
one
had
ever
seen
her
before
ten
days
later
a
lugger
full
of
armed
men
entered
the
bayou
and
moored
at
viosca
wharf
the
visitors
were
for
the
most
part
country
gentlemen
residents
of
franklin
and
neighboring
towns
or
planters
from
the
teche
country
forming
one
of
the
numerous
expeditions
organized
for
the
purpose
of
finding
the
bodies
of
relatives
or
friends
lost
in
the
great
hurricane
and
of
punishing
the
robbers
of
the
dead
they
had
searched
numberless
nooks
of
the
coast
had
given
sepulture
to
many
corpses
had
recovered
a
large
amount
of
jewelry
and
as
feliu
afterward
learned
had
summarily
tried
and
executed
several
of
the
most
abandoned
class
of
wreckers
found
with
valuables
in
their
possession
and
convicted
of
having
mutilated
the
drowned
but
they
came
to
viosca
landing
only
to
obtain
information
he
was
too
well
known
and
liked
to
be
a
subject
for
suspicion
and
moreover
he
had
one
good
friend
in
the
crowd
captain
harris
of
new
orleans
a
veteran
steamboat
man
and
a
market
contractor
to
whom
he
had
disposed
of
many
a
cargo
of
fresh
pompano
and
harris
was
the
first
to
step
to
land
some
ten
of
the
party
followed
him
nearly
all
had
lost
some
relative
or
friend
in
the
great
catastrophe
the
gathering
was
serious
silent
almost
grim
which
formed
about
feliu
mateo
who
had
come
to
the
country
while
a
boy
spoke
english
better
than
the
rest
of
the
cheniere
people
he
acted
as
interpreter
whenever
feliu
found
any
difficulty
in
comprehending
or
answering
questions
and
he
told
them
of
the
child
rescued
that
wild
morning
and
of
swim
his
recital
evoked
a
murmur
of
interest
and
excitement
followed
by
a
confusion
of
questions
well
they
could
see
for
themselves
feliu
said
but
he
hoped
they
would
have
a
little
patience
the
child
was
still
weak
it
might
be
dangerous
to
startle
her
we
arrange
it
just
as
you
like
responded
the
captain
go
ahead
feliu
all
proceeded
to
the
house
under
the
great
trees
feliu
and
captain
harris
leading
the
way
it
was
sultry
and
bright
even
the
was
warm
there
were
pleasant
odors
in
the
shade
and
a
soporific
murmur
made
of
and
the
hum
of
gnats
only
the
captain
entered
the
house
with
feliu
the
rest
remained
without
some
taking
seats
on
a
rude
plank
bench
under
the
oaks
others
flinging
themselves
down
upon
the
weeds
a
few
stood
still
leaning
upon
their
rifles
then
carmen
came
out
to
them
with
gourds
and
a
bucket
of
fresh
water
which
all
were
glad
to
drink
they
waited
many
minutes
perhaps
it
was
the
cool
peace
of
the
place
that
made
them
all
feel
how
hot
and
tired
they
were
conversation
flagged
and
the
general
languor
finally
betrayed
itself
in
a
silence
so
absolute
that
every
seemed
to
become
separately
audible
it
was
broken
at
last
by
the
guttural
voice
of
the
old
captain
emerging
from
the
cottage
leading
the
child
by
the
hand
and
followed
by
carmen
and
feliu
all
who
had
been
resting
rose
up
and
looked
at
the
child
standing
in
a
lighted
space
with
one
tiny
hand
enveloped
by
the
captain
great
brown
fist
she
looked
so
lovely
that
a
general
exclamation
of
surprise
went
up
her
bright
hair
loose
and
steeped
in
the
illuminated
her
like
a
halo
and
her
large
dark
eyes
gentle
and
melancholy
as
a
deer
watched
the
strange
faces
before
her
with
shy
curiosity
she
wore
the
same
dress
in
which
feliu
had
found
her
a
soft
white
fabric
of
muslin
with
trimmings
of
ribbon
that
had
once
been
blue
and
the
now
discolored
silken
scarf
which
had
twice
done
her
such
brave
service
was
thrown
over
her
shoulders
carmen
had
washed
and
repaired
the
dress
very
creditably
but
the
tiny
slim
feet
were
bare
the
shoes
she
wore
that
fearful
night
had
fallen
into
shreds
at
the
first
attempt
to
remove
them
gentlemen
said
captain
harris
we
can
find
no
clew
to
the
identity
of
this
child
there
is
no
mark
upon
her
clothing
and
she
wore
nothing
in
the
shape
of
jewelry
except
this
string
of
coral
beads
we
are
nearly
all
americans
here
and
she
does
not
speak
any
english
does
any
one
here
know
anything
about
her
carmen
felt
a
great
sinking
at
her
heart
was
her
darling
to
be
taken
so
soon
from
her
but
no
answer
came
to
the
captain
query
no
one
of
the
expedition
had
ever
seen
that
child
before
the
coral
beads
were
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
scarf
was
minutely
scrutinized
without
avail
somebody
asked
if
the
child
could
not
talk
german
or
italian
italiano
no
said
feliu
shaking
his
head
one
of
his
luggermen
gioachino
sparicio
who
though
a
sicilian
could
speak
several
italian
idioms
besides
his
own
had
already
essayed
she
speaks
something
or
other
answered
the
captain
but
no
english
i
could
make
her
understand
me
and
feliu
who
talks
nearly
all
the
infernal
languages
spoken
down
this
way
says
he
make
her
understand
him
suppose
some
of
you
who
know
french
talk
to
her
a
bit
laroussel
why
do
you
try
the
young
man
addressed
did
not
at
first
seem
to
notice
the
suggestion
he
was
a
tall
lithe
fellow
with
a
dark
positive
face
he
had
never
removed
his
black
gaze
from
the
child
since
the
moment
of
her
appearance
her
eyes
too
seemed
to
be
all
for
him
to
return
his
scrutiny
with
a
sort
of
vague
pleasure
a
half
savage
confidence
was
it
the
first
embryonic
feeling
of
quickening
in
the
little
brain
some
intuitive
inexplicable
sense
of
kindred
she
shrank
from
doctor
hecker
who
addressed
her
in
german
shook
her
head
at
lawyer
solari
who
tried
to
make
her
answer
in
italian
and
her
look
always
went
back
plaintively
to
the
dark
sinister
face
of
laroussel
laroussel
who
had
calmly
taken
a
human
life
a
wicked
human
life
only
the
evening
before
laroussel
you
the
only
creole
in
this
crowd
said
the
captain
talk
to
her
talk
gumbo
to
her
i
no
doubt
this
child
knows
german
very
well
and
italian
too
he
added
maliciously
but
not
in
the
way
you
gentlemen
pronounce
it
laroussel
handed
his
rifle
to
a
friend
crouched
down
before
the
little
girl
and
looked
into
her
face
and
smiled
her
great
sweet
orbs
shone
into
his
one
moment
seriously
as
if
searching
and
then
she
returned
his
smile
it
seemed
to
touch
something
latent
within
the
man
something
rare
for
his
whole
expression
changed
and
there
was
a
caress
in
his
look
and
voice
none
of
the
men
could
have
believed
possible
as
he
exclaimed
fais
moin
bo
piti
she
pouted
up
her
pretty
lips
and
kissed
his
black
moustache
he
spoke
to
her
again
dis

to

dis

to

then
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
answering
in
her
argent
treble
zouzoune
all
held
their
breath
captain
harris
lifted
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
command
silence

she
began
to
play
with
some
trinkets
attached
to
his
watch
chain
a
very
small
gold
compass
especially
impressed
her
fancy
by
the
trembling
and
flashing
of
its
tiny
needle
and
she
murmured
coaxingly
mo

he
took
all
possible
advantage
of
the
situation
and
replied
at
once

the
splendid
bribe
evidently
impressed
her
greatly
for

rose
to
the

eyes
as
she
answered

laroussel
explained
the
child
name
was
lili
perhaps
a
contraction
of
eulalie
and
her
pet
creole
name
zouzoune
he
thought
she
must
be
the
daughter
of
wealthy
people
but
she
could
not
for
some
reason
or
other
tell
her
family
name
perhaps
she
could
not
pronounce
it
well
and
was
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
some
of
the
old
french
names
were
very
hard
for
creole
children
to
pronounce
so
long
as
the
little
ones
were
indulged
in
the
habit
of
talking
the
patois
and
after
a
certain
age
their
mispronunciations
would
be
made
fun
of
in
order
to
accustom
them
to
abandon
the
idiom
of
the
and
to
speak
only
french
perhaps
again
she
was
really
unable
to
recall
the
name
certain
memories
might
have
been
blurred
in
the
delicate
brain
by
the
shock
of
that
terrible
night
she
said
her
mother
name
was
adele
and
her
father
julien
but
these
were
very
common
names
in
louisiana
and
could
afford
scarcely
any
better
clew
than
the
innocent
statement
that
her
mother
used
to
address
her
father
as
dear
cheri
or
with
the
creole
diminutive
little
papa
papoute
then
laroussel
tried
to
reach
a
clew
in
other
ways
without
success
he
asked
her
about
where
she
lived
what
the
place
was
like
and
she
told
him
about
in
a
court
and
galleries
and
banquettes
and
spoke
of
a
faubou
without
being
able
to
name
any
street
he
asked
her
what
her
father
used
to
do
and
was
assured
that
he
did
everything
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
do
divine
absurdity
of
childish
faith
infinite
artlessness
of
childish
love
probably
the
little
girl
parents
had
been
residents
of
new
orleans
dwellers
of
the
old
colonial
quarter
the
faubourg
the
faubou
well
gentlemen
said
captain
harris
as
laroussel
abandoned
his
in
despair
all
we
can
do
now
is
to
make
inquiries
i
suppose
we
better
leave
the
child
here
she
is
very
weak
yet
and
in
no
condition
to
be
taken
to
the
city
right
in
the
middle
of
the
hot
season
and
nobody
could
care
for
her
any
better
than
she
being
cared
for
here
then
again
seems
to
me
that
as
feliu
saved
her
life
and
that
at
the
risk
of
his
own
he
got
the
prior
claim
anyhow
and
his
wife
is
just
crazy
about
the
child
wants
to
adopt
her
if
we
can
find
her
relatives
so
much
the
better
but
i
say
gentlemen
let
them
come
right
here
to
feliu
themselves
and
thank
him
as
he
ought
to
be
thanked
by
god
that
just
what
i
think
about
it
carmen
understood
the
little
speech
all
the
spanish
charm
of
her
youth
had
faded
out
years
before
but
in
the
one
swift
look
of
gratitude
she
turned
upon
the
captain
it
seemed
to
blossom
again
for
that
quick
moment
she
was
beautiful
the
captain
is
quite
right
observed
hecker
it
would
be
very
dangerous
to
take
the
child
away
just
now
there
was
no
dissent
all
correct
boys
asked
the
captain
well
we
got
to
be
going
zouzoune
but
zouzoune
burst
into
tears
laroussel
was
going
too
give
her
the
thing
laroussel
she
gave
you
a
kiss
anyhow
more
than
she
do
for
me
cried
the
captain
laroussel
turned
detached
the
little
compass
from
his
watch
chain
and
gave
it
to
her
she
held
up
her
pretty
face
for
his
farewell
kiss
vi
but
it
seemed
fated
that
feliu
waif
should
never
be
identified
diligent
inquiry
and
printed
announcements
alike
proved
fruitless
sea
and
sand
had
either
hidden
or
effaced
all
the
records
of
the
little
world
they
had
engulfed
the
annihilation
of
whole
families
the
extinction
of
races
had
in
more
than
one
instance
rendered
vain
all
efforts
to
recognize
the
dead
it
required
the
subtle
perception
of
long
intimacy
to
name
remains
tumefied
and
discolored
by
corruption
and
exposure
mangled
and
gnawed
by
fishes
by
reptiles
and
by
birds
it
demanded
the
great
courage
of
love
to
look
upon
the
eyeless
faces
found
sweltering
in
the
blackness
of
under
the
low
palmettoes
of
the
swamps
where
gorged
buzzards
started
from
sleep
or
cottonmouths
uncoiled
hissing
at
the
coming
of
the
searchers
and
sometimes
all
who
had
loved
the
lost
were
themselves
among
the
missing
the
full
roll
call
of
names
could
never
be
made
out
extraordinary
mistakes
were
committed
men
whom
the
world
deemed
dead
and
buried
came
back
like
ghosts
to
read
their
own
epitaphs
almost
at
the
same
hour
that
laroussel
was
questioning
the
child
in
creole
patois
another
expedition
searching
for
bodies
along
the
coast
discovered
on
the
beach
of
a
low
islet
famed
as
a
haunt
of
pelicans
the
corpse
of
a
child
some
locks
of
bright
hair
still
adhering
to
the
skull
a
string
of
red
beads
a
white
muslin
dress
a
handkerchief
broidered
with
the
initials
were
secured
as
clews
and
the
little
body
was
interred
where
it
had
been
found
and
several
days
before
captain
hotard
of
the
estelle
brousseaux
had
found
drifting
in
the
open
gulf
latitude
degrees
minutes
longitude
degrees
minutes
the
corpse
of
a
woman
clinging
to
a
table
the
body
was
disfigured
beyond
recognition
even
the
slender
bones
of
the
hands
had
been
stripped
by
the
nibs
of
the
one
finger
the
third
of
the
left
which
seemed
to
have
been
protected
by
a
ring
of
gold
as
by
a
charm
graven
within
the
plain
yellow
circlet
was
a
date
juillet
and
the
names
adele
julien
separated
by
a
cross
the
estelle
carried
coffins
that
day
most
of
them
were
already
full
but
there
was
one
for
adele
who
was
she
who
was
her
julien
when
the
estelle
and
many
other
vessels
had
discharged
their
ghastly
cargoes
when
the
bereaved
of
the
land
had
assembled
as
hastily
as
they
might
for
the
du
y
of
identification
when
memories
were
strained
almost
to
madness
in
research
of
names
dates
incidents
for
the
evocation
of
dead
words
resurrection
of
vanished
days
recollection
of
dear
promises
then
in
the
confusion
it
was
believed
and
declared
that
the
little
corpse
found
on
the
pelican
island
was
the
daughter
of
the
wearer
of
the
wedding
ring
adele
la
brierre
nee
florane
wife
of
julien
la
brierre
of
new
orleans
who
was
numbered
among
the
missing
and
they
brought
dead
adele
back
up
shadowy
river
windings
over
linked
brightnesses
of
lake
and
lakelet
through
many
a
green
glimmering
bayou
to
the
creole
city
and
laid
her
to
rest
somewhere
in
the
old
cemetery
and
upon
the
tablet
recording
her
name
were
also
graven
the
words

vii
yet
six
months
afterward
the
face
of
julien
la
brierre
was
seen
again
upon
the
streets
of
new
orleans
men
started
at
the
sight
of
him
as
at
a
spectre
standing
in
the
sun
and
nevertheless
the
apparition
cast
a
shadow
people
paused
approached
half
extended
a
hand
through
old
habit
suddenly
checked
themselves
and
passed
on
wondering
they
should
have
forgotten
asking
themselves
why
they
had
so
nearly
made
an
absurd
mistake
it
was
a
february
day
one
of
those
crystalline
days
of
our
snowless
southern
winter
when
the
air
is
clear
and
cool
and
outlines
sharpen
in
the
light
as
if
viewed
through
the
focus
of
a
diamond
glass
and
in
that
brightness
julien
la
brierre
perused
his
own
brief
epitaph
and
gazed
upon
the
sculptured
name
of
drowned
adele
only
half
a
year
had
passed
since
she
was
laid
away
in
the
high
wall
of
tombs
in
that
strange
colonial
columbarium
where
the
dead
slept
in
rows
behind
squared
marbles
lettered
in
black
or
bronze
yet
her
in
the
highest
range
already
seemed
old
under
our
southern
sun
the
vegetation
of
cemeteries
seems
to
spring
into
being
spontaneously
to
leap
all
suddenly
into
luxuriant
life
microscopic
mossy
growths
had
begun
to
mottle
the
slab
that
closed
her
in
over
its
face
some
singular
creeper
was
crawling
planting
tiny
into
the
chiselled
letters
of
the
inscription
and
from
the
moist
soil
below
speckled
euphorbias
were
growing
up
to
her
and
morning
glories
and
beautiful
green
tangled
things
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
name
and
the
sight
of
the
pretty
lizards
puffing
their
crimson
pouches
in
the
sun
or
undulating
athwart
epitaphs
and
shifting
their
color
when
approached
from
emerald
to
the
caravans
of
the
ants
journeying
to
and
from
tiny
chinks
in
the
masonry
the
bees
gathering
honey
from
the
crimson
blossoms
of
the
whose
radicles
sought
sustenance
perhaps
from
human
dust
in
the
decay
of
generations
all
that
rich
life
of
graves
summoned
up
fancies
of
resurrection
nature
wondrous
transformations
of
flesh
marvellous
bans
migration
of
souls
from
some
forgotten
crevice
of
that
tomb
roof
which
alone
intervened
between
her
and
the
vast
light
a
sturdy
weed
was
growing
he
knew
that
plant
as
it
quivered
against
the
blue
the
as
creole
children
call
it
its
dark
berries
form
the
mockingbird
favorite
food
might
not
its
roots
exploring
darkness
have
found
some
unfamiliar
nutriment
within
might
it
not
be
that
something
of
the
dead
heart
had
risen
to
purple
and
emerald
life
in
the
sap
of
translucent
leaves
in
the
wine
of
the
savage
berries
to
blend
with
the
blood
of
the
wizard
singer
to
lend
a
strange
sweetness
to
the
melody
of
his
wooing
seldom
indeed
does
it
happen
that
a
man
in
the
prime
of
youth
in
the
possession
of
wealth
habituated
to
comforts
and
the
elegances
of
life
discovers
in
one
brief
week
how
minute
his
true
relation
to
the
human
aggregate
how
insignificant
his
part
as
one
living
atom
of
the
social
organism
seldom
at
the
age
of
has
one
been
made
able
to
comprehend
through
experience
alone
that
in
the
vast
and
complex
stream
of
being
he
counts
for
less
than
a
drop
and
that
even
as
the
blood
loses
and
replaces
its
corpuscles
without
a
variance
in
the
volume
and
vigor
of
its
current
so
are
individual
existences
eliminated
and
replaced
in
the
pulsing
of
a
people
life
with
never
a
pause
in
its
mighty
murmur
but
all
this
and
much
more
julien
had
learned
in
seven
merciless
days
seven
successive
and
terrible
shocks
of
experience
the
enormous
world
had
not
missed
him
and
his
place
therein
was
not
void
society
had
simply
forgotten
him
so
long
as
he
had
moved
among
them
all
he
knew
for
friends
had
performed
their
petty
altruistic
roles
had
discharged
their
small
human
obligations
had
kept
turned
toward
him
the
least
selfish
side
of
their
natures
had
made
with
him
a
tolerably
equitable
exchange
of
ideas
and
of
favors
and
after
his
disappearance
from
their
midst
they
had
duly
mourned
for
his
loss
to
themselves
they
had
played
out
the
final
act
in
the
unimportant
drama
of
his
life
it
was
really
asking
too
much
to
demand
a
repetition
impossible
to
deceive
himself
as
to
the
feeling
his
unanticipated
return
had
aroused
feigned
pity
where
he
had
looked
for
sympathetic
welcome
dismay
where
he
had
expected
surprised
delight
and
oftener
airs
of
resignation
or
disappointment
ill
disguised
always
insincerity
politely
masked
or
coldly
bare
he
had
come
back
to
find
strangers
in
his
home
relatives
at
law
concerning
his
estate
and
himself
regarded
as
an
intruder
among
the
living
an
unlucky
guest
a
revenant
how
hollow
and
selfish
a
world
it
seemed
and
yet
there
was
love
in
it
he
had
been
loved
in
it
unselfishly
passionately
with
the
love
of
father
and
of
mother
of
wife
and
child
all
buried
all
lost
forever
oh
would
to
god
the
story
of
that
stone
were
not
a
lie

to
kind

he
also
were

shadowed
the
violet
deepened
and
prickled
itself
with
stars
the
sun
passed
below
the
west
leaving
in
his
wake
a
momentary
splendor
of
vermilion
our
southern
day
is
not
prolonged
by
gloaming
and
julien
thoughts
darkened
with
the
darkening
and
as
swiftly
for
while
there
was
yet
light
to
see
he
read
another
name
that
he
used
to
know
the
name
of
ramirez

en
cienfuegos
isla
de
cuba
wherefore
born
for
what
eternal
purpose
ramirez
in
the
city
of
a
hundred
fires
he
had
blown
out
his
brains
before
the
sepulchre
of
his
young
wife
it
was
a
detached
double
vault
shaped
like
a
huge
chest
and
much
dilapidated
already
under
the
continuous
burrowing
of
the
crawfish
it
had
sunk
greatly
on
one
side
tilting
as
if
about
to
fall
out
from
its
zigzag
fissurings
of
brick
and
plaster
a
sinister
voice
seemed
to
come
go
thou
and
do
likewise
earth
groans
with
her
burthen
even
now
the
burthen
of
man
she
holds
no
place
for
thee
viii
that
voice
pursued
him
into
the
darkness
of
his
chilly
room
haunted
him
in
the
silence
of
his
lodging
and
then
began
within
the
man
that
ghostly
struggle
between
courage
and
despair
between
patient
reason
and
mad
revolt
between
weakness
and
force
between
darkness
and
light
which
all
sensitive
and
generous
natures
must
wage
in
their
own
souls
at
least
once
perhaps
many
times
in
their
lives
memory
in
such
moments
plays
like
an
electric
storm
all
involuntarily
he
found
himself
reviewing
his
life
incidents
long
forgotten
came
back
with
singular
vividness
he
saw
the
past
as
he
had
not
seen
it
while
it
was
the
present
remembrances
of
home
recollections
of
infancy
recurred
to
him
with
terrible
intensity
the
artless
pleasures
and
the
trifling
griefs
the
little
hurts
and
the
tender
pettings
the
hopes
and
the
anxieties
of
those
who
loved
him
the
smiles
and
tears
of
slaves
and
his
first
creole
pony
a
present
from
his
father
the
day
after
he
had
proved
himself
able
to
recite
his
prayers
correctly
in
french
without
one
mispronunciation
without
saying

a
rejoicing
there
was
at
his
return
how
radiant
and
level
the
long
road
of
the
future
seemed
to
open
before
him
everywhere
friends

then
his
first
serious
love
and
the
night
of
the
ball
at
martinsville
the
vision
of
light
gracile
as
a
palm
and
robed
at
once
so
simply
so
exquisitely
in
white
she
had
seemed
to
him
the
supreme
realization
of
all
possible
dreams
of
beauty
and
his
passionate
jealousy
and
the
slap
from
laroussel
and
the
humiliating
duel
with
rapiers
in
which
he
learned
that
he
had
found
his
master
the
scar
was
deep
why
had
not
laroussel
killed
him
then
not
laroussel
they
used
to
salute
each
other
afterward
when
they
met
and
smile
was
kindly
why
had
he
refrained
from
returning
it
where
was
laroussel
now
for
the
death
of
his
generous
father
who
had
sacrificed
so
much
to
reform
him
for
the
death
only
a
short
while
after
of
his
mother
he
had
found
one
sweet
woman
to
console
him
with
her
tender
words
her
loving
lips
her
delicious
caress
she
had
given
him
zouzoune
the
darling
link
between
their
lives
zouzoune
who
waited
each
evening
with
black
eglantine
at
the
gate
to
watch
for
his
coming
and
to
cry
through
all
the
house
like
a
bird
papa
lape
vini
papa
zulien
ape
vini
and
once
that
she
had
made
him
very
angry
by
upsetting
the
ink
over
a
mass
of
business
papers
and
he
had
slapped
her
could
he
ever
forgive
himself
she
had
cried
through
her
sobs
of
astonishment
and
pain
to
laimin
moin
to
batte

thou
lovest
me
thou
beatest
me
next
month
she
would
have
been
five
years
old
to
laimin
moin
to
batte
moin
a
furious
paroxysm
of
grief
convulsed
him
suffocated
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
within
must
burst
must
break
he
flung
himself
down
upon
his
bed
biting
the
coverings
in
order
to
stifle
his
outcry
to
smother
the
sounds
of
his
despair
what
crime
had
he
ever
done
oh
god
that
he
should
be
made
to
suffer
thus
was
it
for
this
he
had
been
permitted
to
live
had
been
rescued
from
the
sea
and
carried
round
all
the
world
unscathed
why
should
he
live
to
remember
to
suffer
to
agonize
was
not
ramirez
wiser
how
long
the
contest
within
him
lasted
he
never
knew
but
ere
it
was
done
he
had
become
in
more
ways
than
one
a
changed
man
for
the
first
though
not
indeed
for
the
last
time
something
of
the
deeper
and
nobler
comprehension
of
human
weakness
and
of
human
suffering
had
been
revealed
to
him
something
of
that
larger
knowledge
without
which
the
sense
of
duty
can
never
be
fully
acquired
nor
the
understanding
of
unselfish
goodness
nor
the
spirit
of
tenderness
the
suicide
is
not
a
coward
he
is
an
egotist
a
ray
of
sunlight
touched
his
wet
pillow
awoke
him
he
rushed
to
the
window
flung
the
latticed
shutters
apart
and
looked
out
something
beautiful
and
ghostly
filled
all
the
vistas
and
in
some
queer
way
the
mist
had
momentarily
caught
and
held
the
very
color
of
the
sky
an
azure
fog
through
it
the
quaint
and
checkered
street
as
yet
but
half
illumined
by
the
sun
took
tones
of
impossible
color
the
view
paled
away
through
faint
bluish
tints
into
transparent
purples
all
the
shadows
were
indigo
how
sweet
the
morning
how
well
life
seemed
worth
living
because
the
sun
had
shown
his
face
through
a
fairy
veil
of
frost
who
was
the
ancient
thinker
was
it
hermes
who
said
the
sun
is
laughter
for
is
he
who
maketh
joyous
the
thoughts
of
men
and
gladdeneth
the
infinite
world
the
shadow
of
the
tide
carmen
found
that
her
little
pet
had
been
taught
how
to
pray
for
each
night
and
morning
when
the
devout
woman
began
to
make
her
orisons
the
child
would
kneel
beside
her
with
little
hands
joined
and
in
a
voice
sweet
and
clear
murmur
something
she
had
learned
by
heart
much
as
this
pleased
carmen
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
child
prayers
could
not
be
wholly
valid
unless
uttered
in
spanish
for
spanish
was
heaven
own
tongue
la
lengua
de
dios
el
idioma
de
dios
and
she
resolved
to
teach
her
to
say
the
salve
maria
and
the
padre
nuestro
in
castilian
also
her
own
favorite
prayer
to
the
virgin
beginning
with
the
words
madre
santisima
toda
dulce
y
hermosa
so
conchita
for
a
new
name
had
been
given
to
her
with
that
terrible
sea
christening
received
her
first
lessons
in
spanish
and
she
proved
a
most
intelligent
pupil
before
long
she
could
prattle
to
feliu
she
would
watch
for
his
return
of
evenings
and
announce
his
coming
with
aqui
viene
mi
papacito
she
learned
too
from
carmen
many
little
caresses
of
speech
to
greet
him
with
feliu
was
not
a
joyous
nature
he
had
his
dark
hours
his
sombre
days
yet
it
was
rarely
that
he
felt
too
sullen
to
yield
to
the
little
one
petting
when
she
would
leap
up
to
reach
his
neck
and
to
coax
his
kiss
with
dame
un
beso
papa
asi
y
otro
otro
otro
he
grew
to
love
her
like
his
own
was
she
not
indeed
his
own
since
he
had
won
her
from
death
and
none
had
yet
come
to
dispute
his
claim
more
and
more
with
the
passing
of
weeks
months
seasons
she
became
a
portion
of
his
life
a
part
of
all
that
he
wrought
for
at
the
first
he
had
had
a
hope
that
the
little
one
might
be
reclaimed
by
relatives
generous
and
rich
enough
to
insist
upon
his
acceptance
of
a
handsome
compensation
and
that
carmen
could
find
some
solace
in
a
pleasant
visit
to
barceloneta
but
now
he
felt
that
no
possible
generosity
could
requite
him
for
her
loss
and
with
the
unconscious
selfishness
of
affection
he
commenced
to
dread
her
identification
as
a
great
calamity
it
was
evident
that
she
had
been
brought
up
nicely
she
had
pretty
prim
ways
of
drinking
and
eating
queer
little
fashions
of
sitting
in
company
and
of
addressing
people
she
had
peculiar
notions
about
colors
in
dress
about
wearing
her
hair
and
she
seemed
to
have
already
imbibed
a
small
stock
of
social
prejudices
not
altogether
in
harmony
with
the
republicanism
of
viosca
point
occasional
swarthy
visitors
men
of
the
manilla
settlements
she
spoke
of
contemptuously
as
and
once
she
shocked
carmen
inexpressibly
by
stopping
in
the
middle
of
her
evening
prayer
declaring
that
she
wanted
to
say
her
prayers
to
a
white
virgin
carmen
senora
de
guadalupe
was
only
a
negra
then
for
the
first
time
carmen
spoke
so
crossly
to
the
child
as
to
frighten
her
but
the
pious
woman
heart
smote
her
the
next
moment
for
that
first
harsh
word
and
she
caressed
the
motherless
one
consoled
her
cheered
her
and
at
last
explained
to
her
i
know
not
how
something
very
wonderful
about
the
little
figurine
something
that
made
chita
eyes
big
with
awe
thereafter
she
always
regarded
the
virgin
of
wax
as
an
object
mysterious
and
holy
and
one
by
one
most
of
chita
little
eccentricities
were
gradually
eliminated
from
her
developing
life
and
thought
more
rapidly
than
ordinary
children
because
singularly
intelligent
she
learned
to
adapt
herself
to
all
the
changes
of
her
new
environment
retaining
only
that
indescribable
something
which
to
an
experienced
eye
tells
of
hereditary
refinement
of
habit
and
of
mind
a
natural
grace
a
ease
and
elegance
of
movement
a
quickness
and
delicacy
of
perception
she
became
strong
again
and
active
active
enough
to
play
a
great
deal
on
the
beach
when
the
sun
was
not
too
fierce
and
carmen
made
a
canvas
bonnet
to
shield
her
head
and
face
never
had
she
been
allowed
to
play
so
much
in
the
sun
before
and
it
seemed
to
do
her
good
though
her
little
bare
feet
and
hands
became
brown
as
copper
at
first
it
must
be
confessed
she
worried
her
a
great
deal
by
various
queer
misfortunes
and
extraordinary
freaks
getting
bitten
by
crabs
falling
into
the
bayou
while
in
pursuit
of
fiddlers
or
losing
herself
at
the
conclusion
of
desperate
efforts
to
run
races
at
night
with
the
moon
or
to
walk
to
the
end
of
the
world
if
she
could
only
once
get
to
the
edge
of
the
sky
she
said
she
could
climb
up
she
wanted
to
see
the
stars
which
were
the
souls
of
good
little
children
and
she
knew
that
god
would
let
her
climb
up
just
what
i
am
afraid
of
thought
carmen
to
herself
he
might
let
her
climb
up
a
little
ghost
but
one
day
naughty
chita
received
a
terrible
lesson
a
lasting
lesson
which
taught
her
the
value
of
obedience
she
had
been
particularly
cautioned
not
to
venture
into
a
certain
part
of
the
swamp
in
the
rear
of
the
grove
where
the
weeds
were
very
tall
for
carmen
was
afraid
some
snake
might
bite
the
child
but
chita
eye
had
discerned
a
gleam
of
white
in
that
direction
and
she
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
the
white
could
only
be
seen
from
one
point
behind
the
furthest
house
where
the
ground
was
high
never
go
there
said
carmen
there
is
a
dead
man
there
will
bite
you
and
yet
one
day
while
carmen
was
unusually
busy
chita
went
there
in
the
early
days
of
the
settlement
a
spanish
fisherman
had
died
and
his
comrades
had
built
him
a
little
tomb
with
the
surplus
of
the
same
bricks
and
other
material
brought
down
the
bayou
for
the
construction
of
viosca
cottages
but
no
one
except
perhaps
some
wandering
duck
hunter
had
approached
the
sepulchre
for
years
high
weeds
and
grasses
wrestled
together
all
about
it
and
rendered
it
totally
invisible
from
the
surrounding
level
of
the
marsh
fiddlers
swarmed
away
as
chita
advanced
over
the
moist
soil
each
uplifting
its
single
huge
claw
as
it
sidled
off
then
frogs
began
to
leap
before
her
as
she
reached
the
thicker
grass
and
brown
insects
sprang
showering
to
right
and
left
as
she
parted
the
tufts
of
the
thickening
verdure
as
she
went
on
the
disappeared
jointed
grasses
and
sinewy
dark
plants
of
a
taller
growth
rose
above
her
head
she
was
almost
deafened
by
the
storm
of
insect
shrilling
and
the
mosquitoes
became
very
wicked
all
at
once
something
long
and
black
and
heavy
wriggled
almost
from
under
her
naked
feet
squirming
so
horribly
that
for
a
minute
or
two
she
could
not
move
for
fright
but
it
slunk
away
somewhere
and
hid
itself
the
weeds
it
had
shaken
ceased
to
tremble
in
its
wake
and
her
courage
returned
she
felt
such
an
exquisite
and
fearful
pleasure
in
the
gratification
of
that
naughty
curiosity
then
quite
unexpectedly
oh
what
a
start
it
gave
her
the
solitary
white
object
burst
upon
her
view
leprous
and
ghastly
as
the
yawn
of
a
tombs
ruin
soon
in
louisiana
the
one
chita
looked
upon
seemed
ready
to
topple
down
there
was
a
great
ragged
hole
at
one
end
where
wind
and
rain
and
perhaps
also
the
burrowing
of
crawfish
and
of
worms
had
loosened
the
bricks
and
caused
them
to
slide
out
of
place
it
seemed
very
black
inside
but
chita
wanted
to
know
what
was
there
she
pushed
her
way
through
a
gap
in
the
thin
and
rotten
line
of
pickets
and
through
some
tall
weeds
with
big
coarse
pink
flowers
then
she
crouched
down
on
hands
and
knees
before
the
black
hole
and
peered
in
it
was
not
so
black
inside
as
she
had
thought
for
a
sunbeam
slanted
down
through
a
chink
in
the
roof
and
she
could
see
a
brown
head
without
hair
without
eyes
but
with
teeth
ever
so
many
teeth
seemed
to
laugh
at
her
and
close
to
it
sat
a
toad
the
hugest
she
had
ever
seen
and
the
white
skin
of
his
throat
kept
puffing
out
and
going
in
and
chita
screamed
and
screamed
and
fled
in
wild
terror
screaming
all
the
way
till
carmen
ran
out
to
meet
her
and
carry
her
home
even
when
safe
in
her
adopted
mother
arms
she
sobbed
with
fright
to
the
vivid
fancy
of
the
child
there
seemed
to
be
some
hideous
relation
between
the
staring
reptile
and
the
brown
with
its
empty
eyes
and
its
the
shock
brought
on
a
fever
a
fever
that
lasted
several
days
and
left
her
very
weak
but
the
experience
taught
her
to
obey
taught
her
that
carmen
knew
best
what
was
for
her
good
it
also
caused
her
to
think
a
great
deal
carmen
had
told
her
that
the
dead
people
never
frightened
good
little
girls
who
stayed
at
home
madrecita
carmen
she
asked
is
my
mamma
dead
pobrecita
yes
my
angel
god
called
her
to
him
your
darling
mother
madrecita
she
asked
again
her
young
eyes
growing
vast
with
horror
is
my
own
mamma
now
like
that
she
pointed
toward
the
place
of
the
white
gleam
behind
the
great
trees
no
no
no
my
darling
cried
carmen
appalled
herself
by
the
ghastly
question
your
mamma
is
with
the
dear
good
loving
god
who
lives
in
the
beautiful
sky
above
the
clouds
my
darling
beyond
the
sun
but
carmen
kind
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
the
child
read
their
meaning
he
who
teareth
off
the
mask
of
the
flesh
had
looked
into
her
face
one
unutterable
moment
she
had
seen
the
brutal
truth
naked
to
the
bone
yet
there
came
to
her
a
little
thrill
of
consolation
caused
by
the
words
of
the
tender
falsehood
for
that
which
she
had
discerned
by
day
could
not
explain
to
her
that
which
she
saw
almost
nightly
in
her
slumber
the
face
the
voice
the
form
of
her
loving
mother
still
lived
somewhere
could
not
have
utterly
passed
away
since
the
sweet
presence
came
to
her
in
dreams
bending
and
smiling
over
her
caressing
her
speaking
to
her
sometimes
gently
chiding
but
always
chiding
with
a
kiss
and
then
the
child
would
laugh
in
her
sleep
and
prattle
in
creole
talking
to
the
luminous
shadow
telling
the
dead
mother
all
the
little
deeds
and
thoughts
of
the
day
why
would
god
only
let
her
come
at
night
her
idea
of
god
had
been
first
defined
by
the
sight
of
a
quaint
french
picture
of
the
creation
an
engraving
which
represented
a
shoreless
sea
under
a
black
sky
and
out
of
the
blackness
a
solemn
and
bearded
gray
head
emerging
and
a
cloudy
hand
through
which
stars
glimmered
god
was
like
old
doctor
de
coulanges
who
used
to
visit
the
house
and
talk
in
a
voice
like
a
low
roll
of
thunder
at
a
later
day
when
chita
had
been
told
that
god
was
everywhere
at
the
same
time
without
and
within
beneath
and
above
all
things
this
idea
became
somewhat
changed
the
awful
bearded
face
the
huge
shadowy
hand
did
not
fade
from
her
thought
but
they
became
fantastically
blended
with
the
larger
and
vaguer
notion
of
something
that
filled
the
world
and
reached
to
the
stars
something
diaphanous
and
incomprehensible
like
the
invisible
air
omnipresent
and
everlasting
like
the
high
blue
of
heaven
ii
she
began
to
learn
the
life
of
the
coast
with
her
acquisition
of
another
tongue
there
came
to
her
also
the
understanding
of
many
things
relating
to
the
world
of
the
sea
she
memorized
with
novel
delight
much
that
was
told
her
day
by
day
concerning
the
nature
surrounding
her
many
secrets
of
the
air
many
of
those
signs
of
heaven
which
the
dwellers
in
cities
can
not
comprehend
because
the
atmosphere
is
thickened
and
made
stagnant
above
them
can
not
even
watch
because
the
horizon
is
hidden
from
their
eyes
by
walls
and
by
weary
avenues
of
trees
with
whitewashed
trunks
she
learned
by
listening
by
asking
by
observing
also
how
to
know
the
signs
that
foretell
wild
weather
tremendous
sunsets
scuddings
and
bridgings
of
cloud
sharpening
and
darkening
of
the
and
the
shriek
of
gulls
flashing
to
land
in
level
flight
out
of
a
still
transparent
sky
and
halos
about
the
moon
she
learned
where
the
with
white
bosoms
and
brown
wings
made
their
hidden
nests
of
sand
and
where
the
cranes
waded
for
their
prey
and
where
the
beautiful
plumaged
in
satiny
lilac
and
silken
green
found
their
food
and
where
the
best
reeds
grew
to
furnish
stems
for
feliu
pipe
and
where
the
ruddy
were
most
often
tossed
upon
the
shore
and
how
the
gray
pelicans
fished
all
together
like
men
moving
in
semicircles
beating
the
flood
with
their
wings
to
drive
the
fish
before
them
and
from
carmen
she
learned
the
fables
and
the
sayings
of
the
sea
the
proverbs
about
its
deafness
its
avarice
its
treachery
its
terrific
power
especially
one
that
haunted
her
for
all
time
thereafter
si
quieres
aprender
a
orar
entra
en
el
mar
if
thou
wouldst
learn
to
pray
go
to
the
sea
she
learned
why
the
sea
is
salt
how
the
tears
of
women
made
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
how
the
sea
has
ii
no
friends
and
how
the
cat
eyes
change
with
the
tides
what
had
she
lost
of
life
by
her
swift
translation
from
the
dusty
existence
of
cities
to
the
open
immensity
of
nature
freedom
what
did
she
gain
doubtless
she
was
saved
from
many
of
those
little
bitternesses
and
restraints
and
disappointments
which
all
city
children
must
suffer
in
the
course
of
their
training
for
the
more
or
less
factitious
life
of
society
obligations
to
remain
very
still
with
every
nimble
nerve
quivering
in
dumb
revolt
the
injustice
of
being
found
troublesome
and
being
sent
to
bed
early
for
the
comfort
of
her
elders
the
cruel
necessity
of
straining
her
pretty
eyes
for
many
long
hours
at
a
time
over
grimy
desks
in
gloomy
though
birds
might
twitter
and
bright
winds
flutter
in
the
trees
without
the
austere
constrains
and
heavy
drowsiness
of
warm
churches
filled
with
the
droning
echoes
of
a
voice
preaching
incomprehensible
things
the
progressively
augmenting
weariness
of
lessons
in
deportment
in
dancing
in
music
in
the
impossible
art
of
keeping
her
dresses
unruffled
and
unsoiled
perhaps
she
never
had
any
reason
to
regret
all
these
she
went
to
sleep
and
awakened
with
the
wild
birds
her
life
remained
as
unfettered
by
formalities
as
her
fine
feet
by
shoes
excepting
carmen
old
in
which
she
learned
to
read
a
little
her
childhood
passed
without
books
also
without
pictures
without
dainties
without
music
without
theatrical
amusements
but
she
saw
and
heard
and
felt
much
of
that
which
though
old
as
the
heavens
and
the
earth
is
yet
eternally
new
and
eternally
young
with
the
holiness
of
beauty
eternally
mystical
and
divine
eternally
weird
the
unveiled
magnificence
of
nature
moods
the
perpetual
poem
hymned
by
wind
and
surge
the
everlasting
splendor
of
the
sky
she
saw
the
quivering
pinkness
of
waters
curled
by
the
breath
of
the
morning
under
the
deepening
of
the
dawn
like
a
far
fluttering
and
scattering
of
of
fire
saw
the
shoreless
cloudless

days
twin

while
the
soul
of
the
world
lay
still
suffused
with
a
as
of
vaporized
sapphire
saw
the
sea
shift
color
change
sheets
when
the
viewless
wizard
of
the
wind
breathed
upon
its
face
and
made
it
green
saw
the
immeasurable
panics
noiseless
scintillant
which
silver
summer
after
summer
curved
leagues
of
beach
with
bodies
of
little
fish
the
yearly
massacre
of
migrating
populations
nations
of
driven
from
their
element
by
terror
and
the
winnowing
of
and
the
rushing
of
porpoises
and
the
rising
of
the
like
a
pillar
of
flame
and
the
diving
and
pitching
and
fighting
of
the
frigates
and
the
gulls
and
the
armored
hordes
of
crabs
swarming
out
to
clear
the
slope
after
the
carnage
and
the
gorging
had
been
done
saw
the
dreams
of
the
sky
scudding
mockeries
of
ridged
foam
and
shadowy
stratification
of
capes
and
coasts
and
promontories
out
and
imageries
multicolored
of
mountain
frondage
and
sierras
whitening
above
sierras
and
phantom
islands
ringed
around
with
lagoons
of
glory
saw
the
toppling
and
smouldering
of
after
the
enormous
conflagration
of
sunsets
incandescence
ruining
into
darkness
and
after
it
a
moving
and
climbing
of
stars
among
the
blacknesses
like
searching
lamps
saw
the
deep
kindle
countless
ghostly
candles
as
for
mysterious
and
a
luminous
billowing
under
a
black
sky
and
effervescences
of
fire
and
the
twirling
and
crawling
of
phosphoric
foam
saw
the
mesmerism
of
the
moon
saw
the
enchanted
tides
in
muttering
obeisance
before
her
often
she
heard
the
music
of
the
marsh
through
the
night
an
infinity
of
flutings
and
tinklings
made
by
tiny
amphibia
like
the
low
blowing
of
numberless
little
tin
horns
the
clanking
of
billions
of
little
bells
and
at
intervals
profound
tones
vibrant
and
heavy
as
of
a
bass
viol
the
orchestra
of
the
great
frogs
and
interweaving
with
it
all
one
continuous
shrilling
keen
as
the
steel
speech
of
a
saw
the
stridulous
telegraphy
of
crickets
but
always
always
dreaming
or
awake
she
heard
the
huge
blind
sea
chanting
that
mystic
and
eternal
hymn
which
none
may
hear
without
awe
which
no
musician
can
learn
heard
the
hoary
preacher
el
pregonador
preaching
the
ancient
word
the
word
as
a
fire
and
as
a
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
in
pieces
the
elohim
word
of
the
sea
unknowingly
she
came
to
know
the
immemorial
sympathy
of
the
mind
with
the
soul
of
the
world
the
melancholy
wrought
by
its
moods
of
gray
the
reverie
responsive
to
its
vagaries
of
mist
the
exhilaration
of
its
vast
exultings
days
of
windy
joy
hours
of
transfigured
light
she
felt
even
without
knowing
it
the
weight
of
the
silences
the
solemnities
of
sky
and
sea
in
these
low
regions
where
all
things
seem
to
dream
waters
and
grasses
with
their
momentary
wavings
woods
with
mosses
that
drip
and
drool
horizons
with
their
delusions
of
vapor
cranes
meditating
in
their
marshes
kites
floating
in
the
high
blue
even
the
children
were
singularly
quiet
and
their
play
less
noisy
though
she
could
not
have
learned
the
difference
than
the
play
of
city
children
hour
after
hour
the
women
sewed
or
wove
in
silence
and
the
brown
men
always
barefooted
always
wearing
rough
blue
shirts
seemed
when
they
lounged
about
the
wharf
on
idle
days
as
if
they
had
told
each
other
long
ago
all
they
knew
or
could
ever
know
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
they
would
stare
at
the
flickering
of
the
current
at
the
drifting
of
clouds
and
buzzard
seldom
looking
at
each
other
and
always
turning
their
black
eyes
again
in
a
weary
way
to
sky
or
sea
even
thus
one
sees
the
horses
and
the
cattle
of
the
coast
seeking
the
beach
to
escape
the
whizzing
flies
all
watch
the
long
waves
rolling
in
and
sometimes
turn
their
heads
a
moment
to
look
at
one
another
but
always
look
back
to
the
waves
again
as
if
wondering
at
a
mystery
how
often
she
herself
had
wondered
wondered
at
the
multiform
changes
of
each
swell
as
it
came
in
transformations
of
tint
of
shape
of
motion
that
seemed
to
betoken
a
life
infinitely
more
subtle
than
the
strange
cold
life
of
lizards
and
of
fishes
and
sinister
and
spectral
then
they
all
appeared
to
move
in
order
according
to
one
law
or
impulse
each
had
its
own
voice
yet
all
sang
one
and
the
same
everlasting
song
vaguely
as
she
watched
them
and
listened
to
them
there
came
to
her
the
idea
of
a
unity
of
will
in
their
motion
a
unity
of
menace
in
their
utterance
the
idea
of
one
monstrous
and
complex
life
the
sea
lived
it
could
crawl
backward
and
forward
it
could
speak
it
only
feigned
deafness
and
sightlessness
for
some
malevolent
end
thenceforward
she
feared
to
find
herself
alone
with
it
was
it
not
at
her
that
it
strove
to
rush
muttering
and
showing
its
white
teeth
just
because
it
knew
that
she
was
all
by
herself
si
quieres
aprender
a
orar
entra
en
el
mar
and
concha
had
well
learned
to
pray
but
the
sea
seemed
to
her
the
one
power
which
god
could
not
make
to
obey
him
as
he
pleased
saying
the
creed
one
day
she
repeated
very
slowly
the
opening
words
creo
en
un
dios
padre
todopoderoso
criador
de
cielo
y
de
la
tierra
and
paused
and
thought
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
madrecita
carmen
she
asked
quien
entonces
hizo
el
mar
who
then
made
the
sea
dios
mi
querida
answered
god
my
darling
all
things
were
made
by
him
todas
las
cosas
fueron
hechas
por
el
even
the
wicked
sea
and
he
had
said
unto
it
thus
far
and
no
farther
was
that
why
it
had
not
overtaken
and
devoured
her
when
she
ran
back
in
fear
from
the
sudden
reaching
out
of
its
waves
thus
far
but
there
were
times
when
it
disobeyed
when
it
rushed
further
shaking
the
world
was
it
because
god
was
then
asleep
could
not
hear
did
not
see
until
too
late
and
the
tumultuous
ocean
terrified
her
more
and
more
it
filled
her
sleep
with
enormous
nightmare
it
came
upon
her
in
dreams
holding
her
with
its
spell
smothering
her
power
of
outcry
heaping
itself
to
the
stars
carmen
became
alarmed
she
feared
that
the
nervous
and
delicate
child
might
die
in
one
of
those
moaning
dreams
out
of
which
she
had
to
arouse
her
night
after
night
but
feliu
answering
her
anxiety
with
one
of
his
favorite
proverbs
suggested
a
heroic
remedy
the
world
is
like
the
sea
those
who
do
not
know
how
to
swim
in
it
are
drowned
and
the
sea
is
like
the
world
he
added
chita
must
learn
to
swim
and
he
found
the
time
to
teach
her
each
morning
at
sunrise
he
took
her
into
the
water
she
was
less
terrified
the
first
time
than
carmen
thought
she
would
be
she
seemed
to
feel
confidence
in
feliu
although
she
screamed
piteously
before
her
first
ducking
at
his
hands
his
teaching
was
not
gentle
he
would
carry
her
out
perched
upon
his
shoulder
until
the
water
rose
to
his
own
neck
and
there
he
would
throw
her
from
him
and
let
her
struggle
to
reach
him
again
as
best
she
could
the
first
few
mornings
she
had
to
be
pulled
out
almost
at
once
but
after
that
feliu
showed
her
less
mercy
and
helped
her
only
when
he
saw
she
was
really
in
danger
he
attempted
no
other
instruction
until
she
had
learned
that
in
order
to
save
herself
from
being
half
choked
by
the
salt
water
she
must
not
scream
and
by
the
time
she
became
habituated
to
these
austere
experiences
she
had
already
learned
by
instinct
alone
how
to
keep
herself
afloat
for
a
while
how
to
paddle
a
little
with
her
hands
then
he
commenced
to
train
her
to
use
them
to
lift
them
well
out
and
throw
them
forward
as
if
reaching
to
dip
them
as
the
blade
of
an
oar
is
dipped
at
an
angle
without
loud
splashing
and
he
showed
her
also
how
to
use
her
feet
she
learned
rapidly
and
astonishingly
well
in
less
than
two
months
feliu
felt
really
proud
at
the
progress
made
by
his
tiny
pupil
it
was
a
delight
to
watch
her
lifting
her
slender
arms
above
the
water
in
swift
easy
curves
with
the
same
fine
grace
that
marked
all
her
other
natural
motions
later
on
he
taught
her
not
to
fear
the
sea
even
when
it
growled
a
little
how
to
ride
a
swell
how
to
face
a
breaker
how
to
dive
she
only
needed
practice
thereafter
and
carmen
who
could
also
swim
finding
the
child
health
improving
marvellously
under
this
new
discipline
took
good
care
that
chita
should
practice
whenever
the
mornings
were
not
too
cold
or
the
water
too
rough
with
the
first
thrill
of
delight
at
finding
herself
able
to
glide
over
the
water
unassisted
the
child
superstitious
terror
of
the
sea
passed
away
even
for
the
adult
there
are
few
physical
joys
keener
than
the
exultation
of
the
swimmer
how
much
greater
the
same
glee
as
newly
felt
by
an
imaginative
child
a
child
whose
vivid
fancy
can
lend
unutterable
value
to
the
most
insignificant
trifles
can
transform
a
to
an
eden
of
her
own
accord
she
would
ask
for
her
morning
bath
as
soon
as
she
opened
her
eyes
it
even
required
some
severity
to
prevent
her
from
remaining
in
the
water
too
long
the
sea
appeared
to
her
as
something
that
had
become
tame
for
her
sake
something
that
loved
her
in
a
huge
rough
way
a
tremendous
playmate
whom
she
no
longer
feared
to
see
come
bounding
and
barking
to
lick
her
feet
and
little
by
little
she
also
learned
the
wonderful
healing
and
caressing
power
of
the
monster
whose
cool
embrace
at
once
dispelled
all
drowsiness
feverishness
weariness
even
after
the
sultriest
nights
when
the
air
had
seemed
to
burn
and
the
mosquitoes
had
filled
the
chamber
with
a
sound
as
of
water
boiling
in
many
kettles
and
on
mornings
when
the
sea
was
in
too
wicked
a
humor
to
be
played
with
how
she
felt
the
loss
of
her
loved
sport
and
prayed
for
calm
her
delicate
constitution
changed
the
soft
pale
flesh
became
firm
and
brown
the
meagre
limbs
rounded
into
robust
symmetry
the
thin
cheeks
grew
peachy
with
richer
life
for
the
strength
of
the
sea
had
entered
into
her
the
sharp
breath
of
the
sea
had
renewed
and
brightened
her
young
blood
thou
primordial
sea
the
awfulness
of
whose
antiquity
hath
stricken
all
mythology
dumb
thou
most
wrinkled
diving
sea
the
millions
of
whose
years
outnumber
even
the
multitude
of
thy
hoary
motions
thou
omniform
and
most
mysterious
sea
mother
of
the
monsters
and
the
gods
whence
shine
eternal
youth
still
do
thy
waters
hold
the
infinite
thrill
of
that
spirit
which
brooded
above
their
face
in
the
beginning
still
is
thy
quickening
breath
an
elixir
unto
them
that
flee
to
thee
for
life
like
the
breath
of
young
girls
like
the
breath
of
children
prescribed
for
the
senescent
by
magicians
of
old
prescribed
unto
weazened
elders
in
the
books
of

iii
eighteen
hundred
and
midsummer
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
heat
motionless
and
ponderous
the
of
the
sky
bleached
from
the
of
the
horizon
the
lukewarm
river
ran
yellow
and
noiseless
as
a
torrent
of
fluid
wax
even
sounds
seemed
blunted
by
the
heaviness
of
the
air
the
rumbling
of
wheels
the
reverberation
of
footsteps
fell
upon
the
ear
like
sounds
that
visit
a
dozing
brain
daily
almost
at
the
same
hour
the
continuous
sense
of
atmospheric
oppression
became
thickened
a
packed
herd
of
clouds
lumbered
up
from
the
gulf
crowded
blackly
against
the
sun
flickered
thundered
and
burst
in
torrential
rain
tepid
perpendicular
and
vanished
utterly
away
then
more
furiously
than
before
the
sun
flamed
down
roofs
and
pavements
steamed
the
streets
seemed
to
smoke
the
air
grew
suffocating
with
vapor
and
the
luminous
city
filled
with
a
faint
sickly
odor
a
stale
smell
as
of
dead
leaves
suddenly
disinterred
from
wet
mould
as
of
grasses
decomposing
after
a
flood
something
saffron
speckled
the
slimy
water
of
the
gutters
sulphur
some
called
it
others
feared
even
to
give
it
a
name
was
it
only
the
pollen
of
some
innocuous
plant
i
do
not
know
but
to
many
it
seemed
as
if
the
invisible
destruction
were
scattering
visible
seed
such
were
the
days
and
each
day
the
city
offered
up
its
hecatomb
to
death
and
the
faces
of
all
the
dead
were
yellow
as
flame
decede

died
on
the
the
the
pillars
of
verandas
the
lamps
over

everywhere
glimmered
the
white
annunciations
of
death
all
the
city
was
spotted
with
them
and
lime
was
poured
into
the
gutters
and
huge
purifying
fires
were
kindled
after
sunset
the
nights
began
with
a
black
heat
there
were
hours
when
the
acrid
air
seemed
to
ferment
for
stagnation
and
to
burn
the
bronchial
tubing
then
toward
morning
it
would
grow
chill
with
venomous
vapors
with
morbific
dews
till
the
sun
came
up
to
lift
the
torpid
moisture
and
to
fill
the
buildings
with
and
the
interminable
procession
of
mourners
and
hearses
and
carriages
again
began
to
circulate
between
the
centres
of
life
and
of
death
and
long
trains
and
steamships
rushed
from
the
port
with
heavy
burden
of
fugitives

in

there
was

who
might
have
been
saved

at

departed
in
apparent
health
unconsciously
carrying
in
their
blood
the
toxic
principle
of
a
malady
unfamiliar
to
physicians
of
the
west
and
north
and
they
died
upon
their
way

kept

sweeping

expanding

funereal

misty

overcrowded
then
the

villages
were
thronged

which
were
easy
to
reach
by

or
by

and
at
last
even
viosca
point
remote
and
unfamiliar
as
it
was
had
a
stranger
to
shelter
a
good
old
gentleman
named
edwards
rather
broken
down
in
health
who
came
as
much
for
quiet
as
for
and
who
had
been
warmly
recommended
to
feliu
by
captain
harris
for
some
years
he
had
been
troubled
by
a
disease
of
the
heart
certainly
the
old
invalid
could
not
have
found
a
more
suitable
place
so
far
as
rest
and
quiet
were
concerned
the
season
had
early
given
such
little
promise
that
several
men
of
the
point
betook
themselves
elsewhere
and
the
aged
visitor
had
two
or
three
vacant
cabins
from
among
which
to
select
a
he
chose
to
occupy
the
most
remote
of
all
which
carmen
furnished
for
him
with
a
cool
moss
bed
and
some
necessary
furniture
including
a
big
wooden
it
seemed
to
him
very
comfortable
thus
he
took
his
meals
with
the
family
spent
most
of
the
day
in
his
own
quarters
spoke
very
little
and
lived
so
unobtrusively
and
inconspicuously
that
his
presence
in
the
settlement
was
felt
scarcely
more
than
that
of
some
dumb
creature
some
domestic
animal
some
humble
pet
whose
relation
to
the
family
is
only
fully
comprehended
after
it
has
failed
to
appear
for
several
days
in
its
accustomed
place
of
patient
waiting
and
we
know
that
it
is
dead
iv
persistently
and
furiously
at
two
of
an
august
morning

he
had
fifty

in

to

he
was
to
earn
another
fifty
dollars
deposited
in

hands
by
bringing
the
doctor
to

he
had
risked
his

for

in

for
a
larger
fee
than
he
had
ever
before
received
and
contained
an
urgent
request
that
he
would
at
once
accompany
sparicio
to
viosca
point
as
the
sender
was
in
hourly
danger
of
death
the
letter
penned
in
a
long
quavering
hand
was
signed
henry
edwards
his
father
dear
old
friend
julien
could
not
refuse
to
go
though
he
feared
it
was
a
hopeless
case
angina
pectoris
and
a
third
attack
at
seventy
years
of
age
would
it
even
be
possible
to
reach
the
sufferer
bedside
in
time
due
giorno
con
vento
said
sparicio
still
he
must
go
and
at
once
it
was
friday
morning
might
reach
the
point
saturday
night
with
a
good
wind
he
roused
his
housekeeper
gave
all
needful
instructions
prepared
his
little
and
long
before
the
first
fire
of
day
had
flashed
to
the
city
spires
he
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
in
the
tiny
cabin
of
a
for
eleven
years
julien
had
devoted
himself
heart
and
soul
to
the
exercise
of
that
profession
he
had
first
studied
rather
as
a
polite
accomplishment
than
as
a
future
calling
in
the
unselfish
pursuit
of
duty
he
had
found
the
only
possible
consolation
for
his
irreparable
loss
and
when
the
war
came
to
sweep
away
his
wealth
he
entered
the
struggle
valorously
not
to
strive
against
men
but
to
use
his
science
against
death
after
the
passing
of
that
huge
shock
which
left
all
the
imposing
and
splendid
fabric
of
southern
feudalism
wrecked
forever
his
profession
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
found
himself
not
only
able
to
supply
those
personal
wants
he
cared
to
satisfy
but
also
to
alleviate
the
misery
of
many
whom
he
had
known
in
days
of
opulence
the
princely
misery
that
never
doffed
its
smiling
mask
though
living
in
secret
from
week
to
week
on
bread
and
tea
the
misery
that
affected
condescension
in
accepting
an
invitation
to
dine
staring
at
the
face
of
a
watch
refused
by
the
with
eyes
half
blinded
by
starvation
the
misery
which
could
afford
but
one
robe
for
three
marriageable
daughters
one
plain
dress
to
be
worn
in
turn
by
each
of
them
on
visiting
days
the
pretty
misery
young
brave
sweet
asking
for
a
treat
of
cakes
too
jocosely
to
have
its
asking
answered
laughing
and
coquetting
with
its
wooers
and
crying
for
hunger
after
they
were
gone
often
and
often
his
heart
had
pleaded
against
his
purse
for
such
as
these
and
won
its
case
in
the
silent
courts
of
self
but
ever
mysteriously
the
gift
came
sometimes
as
if
from
the
hand
of
a
former
slave
sometimes
as
from
a
remorseful
creditor
ashamed
to
write
his
name
only
yellow
victorine
knew
but
the
doctor
housekeeper
never
opened
those
of
hers
until
years
after
the
doctor
name
had
disappeared
from
the
city
directory
he
had
grown
quite
thin
a
little
gray
the
epidemic
had
burthened
him
with
responsibilities
too
multifarious
and
ponderous
for
his
slender
strength
to
bear
the
continual
nervous
strain
of
abnormally
protracted
duty
the
perpetual
interruption
of
sleep
had
almost
prostrated
even
his
will
now
he
only
hoped
that
during
this
brief
absence
from
the
city
he
might
find
renewed
strength
to
do
his
terrible
task
mosquitoes
bit
savagely
and
the
heat
became
thicker
and
there
was
yet
no
wind
sparicio
and
his
hired
boy
carmelo
had
been
walking
backward
and
forward
for
hours
overhead
urging
the
vessel
yard
by
yard
with
long
poles
through
the
slime
of
canals
and
bayous
with
every
heavy
push
the
weary
boy
would
sigh
out
santo
antonio
santo
antonio
sullen
sparicio
himself
at
last
burst
into
vociferations
of
santo
antonio
ah
santissimu
e
santu
diavulu
sacramentu
paescite
vegnu
un
asidente
malidittu
lu
signuri
all
through
the
morning
they
walked
and
pushed
trudged
and
sighed
and
swore
and
the
minutes
dragged
by
more
wearily
than
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
managgia
cristo
co
tutta
a
croce
santissimu
e

diavulu
but
as
they
reached
at
last
the
first
of
the
broad
bright
lakes
the
heat
lifted
the
breeze
leaped
up
the
loose
sail
flapped
and
filled
and
bending
graciously
as
a
skater
the
old
san
marco
began
to
shoot
in
a
straight
line
over
the
blue
flood
then
while
the
boy
sat
at
the
tiller
sparicio
lighted
his
tiny
charcoal
furnace
below
and
prepared
a
simple
meal
delicious
yellow
macaroni
flavored
with
goats
cheese
some
fried
fish
that
smelled
appetizingly
and
rich
black
coffee
of
oriental
fragrance
and
thickness
julien
ate
a
little
and
lay
down
to
sleep
again
this
time
his
rest
was
undisturbed
by
the
mosquitoes
and
when
he
woke
in
the
cooling
evening
he
felt
almost
refreshed
the
san
marco
was
flying
into
barataria
bay
already
the
lantern
in
the
lighthouse
tower
had
begun
to
glow
like
a
little
moon
and
right
on
the
rim
of
the
sea
a
vast
and
vermilion
sun
seemed
to
rest
his
chin
gray
pelicans
came
flapping
around
the
mast
sped
hurtling
by
their
white
bosoms
by
the
western
glow
again
sparicio
little
furnace
was
at
work
more
fish
more
macaroni
more
black
coffee
also
a
bottle
of
gin
made
its
appearance
julien
ate
less
sparingly
at
this
second
meal
and
smoked
a
long
time
on
deck
with
sparicio
who
suddenly
became
very
and
chatted
volubly
in
bad
spanish
and
in
much
worse
english
then
while
the
boy
took
a
few
hours
sleep
the
doctor
helped
delightedly
in
maneuvering
the
little
vessel
he
had
been
a
good
yachtsman
in
other
years
and
sparicio
declared
he
would
make
a
good
fisherman
by
midnight
the
san
marco
began
to
run
with
a
long
swinging
gait
she
had
reached
deep
water
julien
slept
soundly
the
steady
rocking
of
the
sloop
seemed
to
soothe
his
nerves
after
all
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
rose
from
his
little
bunk
next
morning
something
like
this
is
just
what
i
needed
the
pleasant
scent
of
hot
coffee
greeted
him
carmelo
was
handing
him
the
tin
cup
containing
it
down
through
the
hatchway
after
drinking
it
he
felt
really
hungry
he
ate
more
macaroni
than
he
had
ever
eaten
before
then
while
sparicio
slept
he
aided
carmelo
and
during
the
middle
of
the
day
he
rested
again
he
had
not
had
so
much
uninterrupted
repose
for
many
a
week
he
fancied
he
could
feel
himself
getting
strong
at
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
not
get
enough
to
eat
although
there
was
plenty
for
everybody
all
day
long
there
had
been
exactly
the
same
distorting
the
white
shadow
of
the
san
marco
sail
upon
the
blue
water
all
day
long
they
had
been
skimming
over
the
liquid
level
of
a
world
so
that
the
low
green
of
marsh
land
the
fleeing
lines
of
sand
beach
seemed
flaws
or
breaks
in
the
perfected
color
of
the
universe
all
day
long
had
the
cloudless
sky
revealed
through
all
its
exquisite
transparency
that
inexpressible
tenderness
which
no
painter
and
no
poet
can
ever
reimage
that
unutterable
sweetness
which
no
art
of
man
may
ever
shadow
forth
and
which
none
may
ever
comprehend
though
we
feel
it
to
be
in
some
strange
way
akin
to
the
luminous
and
unspeakable
charm
that
makes
us
wonder
at
the
eyes
of
a
woman
when
she
loves
evening
came
and
the
great
dominant
celestial
tone
deepened
the
circling
horizon
filled
with
ghostly
tints
spectral
greens
and
grays
and
and
carmelo
as
he
crouched
at
the
tiller
was
singing
in
a
low
clear
alto
some
tristful
little
melody
over
the
sea
behind
them
lay
a
long
low
arm
of
before
them
flamed
the
splendor
of
they
were
sailing
into
a
mighty
glory
into
a
vast
and
awful
light
of
gold
shading
his
vision
with
his
fingers
sparicio
pointed
to
the
long
lean
limb
of
land
from
which
they
were
fleeing
and
said
to
la
brierre
islan
julien
knew
it
he
only
nodded
his
head
in
reply
and
looked
the
other
way
into
the
glory
of
god
then
wishing
to
divert
the
attention
to
another
theme
he
asked
what
was
carmelo
singing
sparicio
at
once
shouted
to
the
lad
ha
ho
carmelo
santu
diavulu
sing
he
nicee
added
the
boatman
with
his
peculiar
dark
smile
and
then
carmelo
sang
loud
and
clearly
the
song
he
had
been
singing
before
one
of
those
artless
mediterranean
ballads
full
of
caressing
and
young
passion
and
melancholy
beauty
ancor
belta
fulgente
come
tu
allor
ascoltar
non
dei
gente
solo
interroga
il
tuo
cor
he
nicee
mucha
bueno
murmured
the
fisherman
and
then
suddenly
with
a
rich
and
splendid
basso
that
seemed
to
thrill
every
fibre
of
the
planking
sparicio
joined
in
the
song
pur
eterno
ne
deilitto
sembri
a
te
che
una
favola
sol
all
the
roughness
of
the
man
was
gone
to
julien
startled
fancy
the
fishers
had
ceased
to
be
lo
carmelo
was
a
princely
page
sparicio
a
king
how
perfectly
their
voices
married
together
they
sang
with
passion
with
power
with
truth
with
that
wondrous
natural
art
which
is
the
birthright
of
the
rudest
italian
soul
and
the
stars
throbbed
out
in
the
heaven
and
the
glory
died
in
the
west
and
the
night
opened
its
heart
and
the
splendor
of
the
eternities
fell
all
about
them
still
they
sang
and
the
san
marco
sped
on
through
the
soft
gloom
ever
slightly
swerved
by
the
steady
blowing
of
the
southeast
wind
in
her
sail
always
wearing
the
same
of
about
her
prow
always
accompanied
by
the
same
swells
always
spinning
out
behind
her
the
same
long
trail
of
interwoven
foam
and
julien
looked
up
ever
the
night
thrilled
more
and
more
with
silent
twinklings
more
and
more
multitudinously
lights
pointed
in
the
eternities
the
evening
star
quivered
like
a
great
drop
of
liquid
white
fire
ready
to
fall
vega
flamed
as
a
pharos
lighting
the
courses
ethereal
to
guide
the
sailing
of
the
suns
and
the
swarming
of
fleets
of
worlds
then
the
vast
sweetness
of
that
violet
night
entered
into
his
blood
filled
him
with
that
awful
joy
so
near
akin
to
sadness
which
the
sense
of
the
infinite
brings
when
one
feels
the
poetry
of
the
most
ancient
and
most
excellent
of
poets
and
then
is
smitten
at
once
with
the
of
the
sickliness
and
selfishness
of
man
of
the
blindness
and
brutality
of
cities
whereinto
the
divine
blue
light
never
purely
comes
and
the
sanctification
of
the
silences
never
descends
furious
cities
walled
away
from
heaven
oh
if
one
could
only
sail
on
thus
always
always
through
such
a
night
through
such
a
violet
light
and
hear
sparicio
and
carmelo
sing
even
though
it
were
the
same
melody
always
always
the
same
song
scuza
out
julien
bent
down
as
the
big
boom
loosened
swung
over
his
head
the
san
marco
was
rounding
into
shore
heading
for
her
home
sparicio
lifted
a
huge
from
the
deck
put
it
to
his
lips
filled
his
deep
lungs
and
flung
out
into
the
night
thrice
a
profound
mellifluent
booming
a
minute
passed
then
ghostly
faint
as
an
echo
from
very
far
away
a
triple
blowing
responded
and
a
long
purple
mass
loomed
and
swelled
into
sight
heightened
approached
land
and
trees
and
lights
that
swung
the
san
marco
glided
into
a
bayou
under
a
high
wharfing
of
timbers
where
a
bearded
fisherman
waited
and
a
woman
sparicio
flung
up
a
rope
the
bearded
man
caught
it
by
the
and
tethered
the
san
marco
to
her
place
then
he
asked
in
a
deep
voice
has
traido
al
doctor
si
si
answered
sparicio
y
el
viejo
aye
pobre
responded
feliu
hace
tres
dias
que
esta
muerto
henry
edwards
was
dead
he
had
died
very
suddenly
without
a
cry
or
a
word
while
resting
in
his
the
very
day
after
sparicio
had
sailed
they
had
made
him
a
grave
in
the
marsh
among
the
high
weeds
not
far
from
the
ruined
tomb
of
the
spanish
fisherman
but
sparicio
had
fairly
earned
his
hundred
dollars
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
at
viosca
point
except
to
rest
feliu
and
all
his
men
were
going
to
barataria
in
the
morning
on
business
the
doctor
could
accompany
them
there
and
take
the
grand
island
steamer
monday
for
new
orleans
with
this
intention
julien
retired
not
sorry
for
being
able
to
stretch
himself
at
full
length
on
the
good
bed
prepared
for
him
in
one
of
the
unoccupied
cabins
but
he
woke
before
day
with
a
feeling
of
intense
prostration
a
violent
headache
and
such
an
aversion
for
the
mere
idea
of
food
that
feliu
invitation
to
breakfast
at
five
gave
him
an
internal
qualm
perhaps
a
touch
of
malaria
in
any
case
he
felt
it
would
be
both
dangerous
and
useless
to
return
to
town
unwell
and
feliu
observing
his
condition
himself
advised
against
the
journey
wednesday
he
would
have
another
opportunity
to
leave
and
in
the
meanwhile
carmen
would
take
good
care
of
him
the
boats
departed
and
julien
slept
again
the
sun
was
high
when
he
rose
up
and
dressed
himself
feeling
no
better
he
would
have
liked
to
walk
about
the
place
but
felt
nervously
afraid
of
the
sun
he
did
not
remember
having
ever
felt
so
broken
down
before
he
pulled
a
to
the
window
tried
to
smoke
a
cigar
it
commenced
to
make
him
feel
still
sicker
and
he
flung
it
away
it
seemed
to
him
the
cabin
was
swaying
as
the
san
marco
swayed
when
she
first
reached
the
deep
water
a
light
rustling
sound
approached
a
sound
of
quick
feet
treading
the
grass
then
a
shadow
slanted
over
the
threshold
in
the
glow
of
the
open
doorway
stood
a
young
girl
gracile
tall
with
singularly
splendid
eyes
brown
eyes
peeping
at
him
from
beneath
a
golden
riot
of
loose
hair
maman
si
vous
besoin
chose
she
spoke
the
rude
french
of
the
fishing
villages
where
the
language
lives
chiefly
as
a
baragouin
mingled
often
with
words
and
forms
belonging
to
many
other
tongues
she
wore
a
dress
of
some
light
stuff
in
color
boys
shoes
were
on
her
feet
he
did
not
reply
and
her
large
eyes
grew
larger
for
wonder
at
the
strange
fixed
gaze
of
the
physician
whose
face
had
visibly
bleached
blanched
to
silent
seconds
passed
and
still
the
eyes
stared
flamed
as
if
the
life
of
the
man
had
centralized
and
focussed
within
them
his
voice
had
risen
to
a
cry
in
his
throat
quivered
and
swelled
one
passionate
instant
and
failed
as
in
a
dream
when
one
strives
to
call
and
yet
can
only
moan
she
her
unforgotten
eyes
her
brows
her
lips
the
oval
of
her
face
the
of
her
hair
own
poise
her
own
grace
even
the
very
turn
of
her
neck
even
the
of
her
speech
had
the
grave
sent
forth
a
shadow
to
haunt
him
could
the
perfidious
sea
have
yielded
up
its
dead
for
one
terrible
fraction
of
a
minute
memories
doubts
fears
mad
fancies
went
pulsing
through
his
brain
with
a
rush
like
the
rhythmic
throbbing
of
an
electric
stream
then
the
shock
passed
the
reason
spoke
fool
count
the
long
years
since
you
first
saw
her
thus
count
the
years
that
have
gone
since
you
looked
upon
her
last
and
time
has
never
halted
silly
heart
neither
has
death
stood
still
the
clear
voice
of
the
young
girl
asked
she
thought
he
had
made
some
response
she
could
not
distinctly
hear
mastering
himself
an
instant
as
the
heart
faltered
back
to
its
duty
and
the
color
remounted
to
his
lips
he
answered
her
in
french
pardon
me
i
did
not
hear
you
gave
me
such
a
start
but
even
then
another
extraordinary
fancy
flashed
through
his
thought
and
with
the
tutoiement
of
a
parent
to
a
child
with
an
irresistible
outburst
of
such
tenderness
as
almost
frightened
her
he
cried
oh
merciful
god
how
like
her
tell
me
darling
your
name
tell
me
who
you
are
qui
tu
es
mignonne
ton

who
was
it
had
asked
her
the
same
question
in
another
idiom
ever
so
long
ago
the
man
with
the
black
eyes
and
nose
like
an
beak
the
one
who
gave
her
the
compass
not
this
man
no
she
answered
with
the
timid
gravity
of
surprise
chita
viosca
he
still
watched
her
face
and
repeated
the
name
slowly
reiterated
it
in
a
tone
of
wonderment
chita
viosca
chita
viosca
a
dire
she
said
looking
down
at
her
feet
concha
conchita
his
strange
solemnity
made
her
smile
the
smile
of
shyness
that
knows
not
what
else
to
do
but
it
was
the
smile
of
dead
adele
thanks
my
child
he
exclaimed
of
a
sudden
in
a
quick
hoarse
changed
tone
he
felt
that
his
emotion
would
break
loose
in
some
wild
way
if
he
looked
upon
her
longer
i
would
like
to
see
your
mother
this
evening
but
i
now
feel
too
ill
to
go
out
i
am
going
to
try
to
rest
a
little
nothing
i
can
bring
you
she
asked
some
fresh
milk
nothing
now
dear
if
i
need
anything
later
i
will
tell
your
mother
when
she
comes
mamma
does
not
understand
french
very
well
no
importa
conchita
le

en
espanol
bien
entonces
she
responded
with
the
same
exquisite
smile
adios
senor
but
as
she
turned
in
going
his
piercing
eye
discerned
a
little
brown
speck
below
the
pretty
lobe
of
her
right
ear
just
in
the
peachy
curve
between
neck
and
cheek
his
own
little
zouzoune
had
a
birthmark
like
that
he
remembered
the
faint
pink
trace
left
by
his
fingers
above
and
below
it
the
day
he
had
slapped
her
for
overturning
his
ink
bottle
to
laimin
moin
to
batte

chita
chita
she
did
not
hear
after
all
what
a
mistake
he
might
have
made
were
not
nature
coincidences
more
wonderful
than
fiction
better
to
wait
to
question
the
mother
first
and
thus
make
sure
still
there
were
so
many
coincidences
the
face
the
smile
the
eyes
the
voice
the
whole
charm
then
that
mark
and
the
fair
hair
zouzoune
had
always
resembled
adele
so
strangely
that
golden
hair
was
a
scandinavian
bequest
to
the
florane
family
the
tall
daughter
of
a
norwegian
sea
captain
had
once
become
the
wife
of
a
florane
viosca
who
ever
knew
a
viosca
with
such
hair
yet
again
these
spanish
emigrants
sometimes
married
blonde
german
girls
might
be
a
case
of
atavism
too
who
was
this
viosca
if
that
was
his
wife
the
little
brown
carmen
whence
chita
sunny
hair
and
this
was
part
of
that
same
desolate
shore
whither
the
last
island
dead
had
been
drifted
by
that
tremendous
surge
on
a
clear
day
with
a
good
glass
one
might
discern
from
here
the
long
blue
streak
of
that
ghastly
coast
somewhere
between
here
and
there
merciful
god
but
again
that
before
the
fight
at
chancellorsville
laroussel
had
begun
to
tell
him
such
a
singular
story
chance
had
brought
them
the
old
enemies
together
made
them
dear
friends
in
the
face
of
death
how
little
he
had
comprehended
the
man
what
a
brave
true
simple
soul
went
up
that
day
to
the
lord
of
battles
what
was
it
that
story
about
the
little
creole
girl
saved
from
last
island
that
story
which
was
never
finished
eh
what
a
pain
evidently
he
had
worked
too
much
slept
too
little
a
decided
case
of
nervous
prostration
he
must
lie
down
and
try
to
sleep
these
pains
in
the
head
and
back
were
becoming
unbearable
nothing
but
rest
could
avail
him
now
he
stretched
himself
under
the
mosquito
curtain
it
was
very
still
breathless
hot
the
venomous
insects
were
thick
they
filled
the
room
with
a
continuous
ebullient
sound
as
if
invisible
kettles
were
boiling
overhead
a
sign
of
storm
still
it
was
strange
he
could
not
perspire
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
laroussel
was
bending
over
him
laroussel
in
his
cavalry
uniform
bon
jour
camarade
nous
allons
avoir
un
bien
mauvais
temps
mon
pauvre
julien
how
bad
weather
comment
un
mauvais
temps
he
looked
in
laroussel
face
there
was
something
so
singular
in
his
smile
ah
yes
he
remembered
now
it
was
the
wound
un
vilain
temps
whispered
laroussel
then
he
was
gone
whither
cheri
the
whisper
roused
him
with
a
fearful
start
adele
whisper
so
she
was
wont
to
rouse
him
sometimes
in
the
old
sweet
nights
to
crave
some
little
attention
for
ailing
eulalie
to
make
some
little
confidence
she
had
forgotten
to
utter
during
the
happy
evening
no
no
it
was
only
the
trees
the
sky
was
clouding
over
the
wind
was
rising
how
his
heart
beat
how
his
temples
pulsed
why
this
was
fever
such
pains
in
the
back
and
head
still
his
skin
was
dry
dry
as
parchment
burning
he
rose
up
and
a
bursting
weight
of
pain
at
the
base
of
the
skull
made
him
reel
like
a
drunken
man
he
staggered
to
the
little
mirror
nailed
upon
the
wall
and
looked
how
his
eyes
glowed
and
there
was
blood
in
his
mouth
he
felt
his
pulse
spasmodic
terribly
rapid
could
it
possibly
no
this
must
be
some
pernicious
malarial
fever
the
creole
does
not
easily
fall
a
prey
to
the
great
tropical
malady
unless
after
a
long
absence
in
other
climates
true
he
had
been
four
years
in
the
army
but
this
was
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
opening
his
medicine
chest
he
measured
out
and
swallowed
thirty
grains
of
quinine
then
he
lay
down
again
his
head
pained
more
and
more
it
seemed
as
if
the
cervical
vertebrae
were
filled
with
fluid
iron
and
still
his
skin
remained
dry
as
if
tanned
then
the
anguish
grew
so
intense
as
to
force
a
groan
with
almost
every
aspiration
nausea
and
the
stinging
bitterness
of
quinine
rising
in
his
throat
dizziness
and
a
brutal
wrenching
within
his
stomach
everything
began
to
look
pink
the
light
was
it
darkened
more
kindled
with
deepening
tint
something
kept
sparkling
and
spinning
before
his
sight
like
a
firework
then
a
burst
of
blood
mixed
with
chemical
bitterness
filled
his
mouth
the
light
became
scarlet
as
claret
this
this
was
not
malaria
vi
carmen
knew
what
it
was
but
the
brave
little
woman
was
not
afraid
of
it
many
a
time
before
she
had
met
it
face
to
face
in
havanese
summers
she
knew
how
to
wrestle
with
it
she
had
torn
feliu
life
away
from
its
yellow
clutch
after
one
of
those
long
struggles
that
strain
even
the
strength
of
love
now
she
feared
mostly
for
chita
she
had
ordered
the
girl
under
no
circumstances
to
approach
the
cabin
julien
felt
that
blankets
had
been
heaped
upon
him
that
some
gentle
hand
was
bathing
his
scorching
face
with
vinegar
and
water
vaguely
also
there
came
to
him
the
idea
that
it
was
night
he
saw
the
of
a
woman
moving
against
the
red
light
upon
the
wall
he
saw
there
was
a
lamp
burning
then
the
delirium
seized
him
he
moaned
sobbed
cried
like
a
child
talked
wildly
at
intervals
in
french
in
english
in
spanish
mentira
you
could
not
be
her
mother
still
if
you
were
and
she
must
not
come
in
here

she
only
once
till
the

she

they
need

so
much
the
slate
is
always
full
the

will
never

they
will
ring
that
bell
for
me
when
i
am
dead
so
will
i
rise
again
resurgam
how
could
i
save
him
could
not
save
myself
it
was
a
bad
case
at
seventy
years
there
qui
ca
he
saw
laroussel
again
reaching
out
a
hand
to
him
through
a
whirl
of
red
smoke
he
tried
to
grasp
it
and
could
not
mon
ami
said
laroussel
tu
vas
la
voir
bientot
who
was
he
to
see
soon
qui
done
laroussel
but
laroussel
did
not
answer
through
the
red
mist
he
seemed
to
smile
then
passed
for
some
hours
carmen
had
trusted
she
could
save
her
patient
desperate
as
the
case
appeared
to
be
his
was
one
of
those
rapid
and
violent
attacks
such
as
often
despatch
their
victims
in
a
single
day
in
the
cuban
hospitals
she
had
seen
many
and
many
terrible
examples
strong
young
men
soldiers
fresh
from
spain
carried
panting
to
the
fever
wards
at
sunrise
carried
to
the
cemeteries
at
sunset
even
troopers
riddled
with
revolutionary
bullets
had
lingered
longer
still
she
had
believed
she
might
save
julien
life
the
burning
forehead
once
began
to
bead
the
burning
hands
grew
moist
but
now
the
wind
was
moaning
the
air
had
become
lighter
thinner
cooler
a
stone
was
gathering
in
the
east
and
to
the
man
the
change
meant
death
impossible
to
bring
the
priest
of
the
caminada
now
and
there
was
no
other
within
a
day
sail
she
could
only
pray
she
had
lost
all
hope
in
her
own
power
to
save
still
the
sick
man
raved
but
he
talked
to
himself
at
longer
intervals
and
with
longer
pauses
between
his
words
his
voice
was
growing
more
feeble
his
speech
more
incoherent
his
thought
vacillated
and
distorted
like
flame
in
a
wind
weirdly
the
past
became
confounded
with
the
present
impressions
of
sight
and
of
sound
interlinked
in
fastastic
affinity
the
face
of
chita
viosca
the
murmur
of
the
rising
storm
then
flickers
of
spectral
lightning
passed
through
his
eyes
through
his
brain
with
every
throb
of
the
burning
arteries
then
utter
darkness
came
a
darkness
that
surged
and
moaned
as
the
circumfluence
of
a
shadowed
sea
and
through
and
over
the
moaning
pealed
one
multitudinous
human
cry
one
hideous
interblending
of
shoutings
and
shriekings
a
woman
hand
was
locked
in
his
own
tighter
he
muttered
tighter
still
darling
hold
as
long
as
you
can
it
was
the
tenth
night
of
august
eighteen
hundred
and
cheri
again
the
mysterious
whisper
startled
him
to
consciousness
the
dim
knowledge
of
a
room
filled
with
ruby
colored
light
and
the
sharp
odor
of
vinegar
the
house
swung
round
slowly
the
crimson
flame
of
the
lamp
lengthened
and
broadened
by
turns
then
everything
turned
dizzily
fast
whirled
as
if
spinning
in
a
vortex
nausea
unutterable
and
a
frightful
anguish
as
of
teeth
devouring
him
within
tearing
more
and
more
furiously
at
his
breast
then
one
atrocious
wrenching
rending
burning
and
the
gush
of
blood
burst
from
lips
and
nostrils
in
a
smothering
deluge
again
the
vision
of
lightnings
the
swaying
and
the
darkness
of
long
ago
quick
quick
hold
fast
to
the
table
adele
never
let
go
up
up
up
what
higher
yet
up
to
the
red
sky
red
heated
iron
when
its
vermilion
dies
so
too
the
frightful
flood
and
noiseless
noiseless
because
heavy
clammy
thick
warm
sickening
blood
well
might
the
land
quake
for
the
weight
of
such
a
tide
why
did
adele
speak
spanish
who
prayed
for
him
alma
de
cristo
santisima
santificame
sangre
de
cristo
embriagame
o
buen
jesus
oye
me
out
of
the
darkness
into
such
a
light
an
azure
haze
ah
the
delicious
frost
all
the
streets
were
filled
with
the
sweet
blue
mist
voiceless
the
city
and
white
crooked
and
weed
grown
its
narrow
ways
old
streets
of
tombs
these
eh
how
odd
a
custom
a
at
every
door
yes
of
course
a
the
dead
are
physicians
of
souls
they
may
be
summoned
only
by
night
called
up
from
the
darkness
and
silence
yet
she
might
he
not
dare
to
ring
for
her
even
by
day
strange
he
had
deemed
it
day
why
it
was
black
starless
and
it
was
growing
queerly
cold
how
should
he
ever
find
her
now
it
was
so
black
so
cold
cheri
all
the
dwelling
quivered
with
the
mighty
whisper
outside
the
great
oaks
were
trembling
to
their
roots
all
the
shore
shook
and
blanched
before
the
calling
of
the
sea
and
carmen
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
the
dead
cried
out
alone
in
the
night
o
jesus
misericordioso
tened
compasion
