biography
i
any
reader
of
the
books
of
joseph
conrad
it
must
be
at
once
plain
that
his
immediate
experiences
and
impressions
of
life
have
gone
very
directly
to
the
making
of
his
art
it
may
happen
often
enough
that
an
author
s
artistic
life
is
of
no
importance
to
the
critic
and
that
his
dealing
with
it
is
merely
a
personal
impertinence
and
curiosity
but
with
the
life
of
joseph
conrad
the
critic
has
something
to
do
because
again
and
again
this
writer
deliberately
evokes
the
power
of
personal
reminiscence
charging
it
with
the
burden
of
his
philosophy
and
the
creation
of
his
characters
with
the
details
of
his
life
we
can
not
in
any
way
be
concerned
but
with
the
three
backgrounds
against
whose
form
and
colour
his
art
has
been
placed
we
have
some
compulsory
connection
joseph
conrad
teodor
josef
konrad
karzeriowski
was
born
on
december
and
his
birthplace
was
the
ukraine
in
the
south
of
poland
in
his
father
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
last
polish
rebellion
was
banished
to
vologda
the
boy
lived
with
his
mother
and
father
there
until
his
mother
died
when
he
was
sent
back
to
the
ukraine
in
his
lather
died
conrad
was
then
sent
to
school
in
cracow
and
there
he
remained
until
when
following
an
absolutely
compelling
impulse
he
went
to
sea
in
the
month
of
may
he
first
landed
on
english
ground
he
knew
at
that
time
no
english
but
learnt
rapidly
and
in
the
autumn
of
joined
the
of
as
ordinary
seaman
he
became
a
master
in
the
english
merchant
service
in
in
which
year
he
was
naturalised
in
he
left
the
sea
whose
servant
he
had
been
for
nearly
twenty
years
he
sent
the
manuscript
of
a
novel
that
he
had
been
writing
at
various
periods
during
his
sea
life
to
mr
fisher
unwin
with
that
publisher
s
acceptance
of
s
the
third
period
of
his
life
began
since
then
his
history
has
been
the
history
of
his
books
looking
for
an
instant
at
the
dramatic
contrast
and
almost
ironical
relationship
of
these
three
backgrounds
poland
the
sea
the
inner
security
and
tradition
of
an
english
one
can
realise
what
they
may
make
of
an
artist
that
early
polish
atmosphere
viewed
through
all
the
deep
light
and
high
shade
of
a
remembered
childhood
may
be
enough
to
give
life
and
vigour
to
any
poet
s
temperament
the
romantic
melancholy
born
of
early
years
in
such
an
atmosphere
might
well
plant
deeply
in
any
soul
the
ironic
contemplation
of
an
impossible
freedom
growing
into
youth
in
a
land
whose
farthest
bounds
were
held
by
unlawful
tyranny
conrad
may
well
have
contemplated
the
sea
as
the
one
unlimited
monarchy
of
freedom
and
even
although
he
were
too
young
to
realise
what
impulses
those
were
that
drove
him
he
may
have
felt
that
space
and
size
and
the
force
of
a
power
stronger
than
man
were
the
only
conditions
of
possible
liberty
he
sought
those
conditions
found
them
and
clung
to
them
he
found
too
an
ironic
pity
for
men
who
could
still
live
slaves
and
prisoners
to
other
men
when
to
them
also
such
freedom
was
possible
that
ironic
pity
he
never
afterwards
lost
and
the
romance
that
was
in
him
received
a
mighty
impulse
from
that
contrast
that
he
was
always
now
to
contemplate
he
discovered
the
sea
and
paid
to
her
at
once
his
debt
of
gratitude
and
obedience
he
thought
it
no
hard
thing
to
obey
her
when
he
might
at
the
same
time
so
honestly
admire
her
and
she
has
remained
for
him
as
an
artist
the
only
personality
that
he
has
been
able
wholeheartedly
to
admire
he
found
in
her
something
stronger
than
man
and
he
must
have
triumphed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
dominion
that
she
could
exercise
if
she
would
over
the
tyrannies
that
he
had
known
in
his
childhood
he
found
too
in
her
service
the
type
of
man
who
most
strongly
appealed
to
him
he
had
known
a
world
composed
of
threats
fugitive
rebellions
wild
outbursts
of
defiance
inefficient
struggles
against
tyranny
he
was
in
the
company
now
of
those
who
realised
so
completely
the
relationship
of
themselves
and
their
duty
to
their
master
and
their
service
that
there
was
simply
nothing
to
be
said
about
it
england
had
perhaps
long
ago
called
to
him
with
her
promise
of
freedom
and
now
on
an
english
ship
he
realised
the
practice
and
performance
of
that
freedom
indulged
in
as
it
was
with
the
fewest
possible
words
moreover
with
his
fund
of
romantic
imagination
he
must
have
been
pleased
by
the
contrast
of
his
present
company
men
who
by
sheer
lack
of
imagination
ruled
and
served
the
most
imaginative
force
in
nature
the
wonders
of
the
sea
by
day
and
by
night
were
unnoticed
by
his
companions
and
he
admired
their
lack
of
vision
too
much
vision
had
driven
his
country
under
the
heel
of
tyranny
had
bred
in
himself
a
despair
of
any
possible
freedom
for
men
now
he
was
a
citizen
of
a
world
where
freedom
reigned
because
men
could
not
perceive
how
it
could
be
otherwise
the
two
sides
of
the
shield
were
revealed
to
him
then
towards
the
end
of
his
twenty
years
service
of
the
sea
the
creative
impulse
in
him
demanded
an
outlet
he
wrote
at
stray
moments
of
opportunity
during
several
years
a
novel
wrote
it
for
his
pleasure
and
diversion
sent
it
finally
to
a
publisher
with
all
that
lack
of
confidence
in
posts
and
publishers
that
every
author
who
cares
for
his
creations
will
feel
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
has
said
that
if
s
had
been
refused
he
would
never
have
written
again
but
we
may
well
believe
that
let
the
fate
of
that
book
be
what
it
might
the
energy
and
surprise
of
his
discovery
of
the
sea
must
have
been
declared
to
the
world
s
however
was
not
rejected
its
publication
caused
to
remark
the
name
of
mr
conrad
is
new
to
us
but
it
appears
to
us
as
if
he
might
become
the
kipling
of
the
malay
he
had
therefore
encouragement
of
the
most
dignified
kind
from
the
beginning
he
himself
however
may
have
possibly
regarded
that
day
in
when
henley
accepted
nigger
of
the
for
new
as
a
more
important
date
in
his
new
career
that
date
may
serve
for
the
commencement
of
the
third
period
of
his
adventure
the
quiet
atmosphere
of
the
england
that
he
had
adopted
made
the
final
almost
inevitable
contrast
with
the
earlier
periods
with
such
a
country
behind
him
it
was
possible
for
him
to
contemplate
in
peace
the
whole
case
of
his
earlier
life
it
was
as
a
case
that
he
saw
it
a
case
that
was
to
produce
all
those
other
cases
that
were
his
books
this
has
been
their
history
ii
his
books
also
find
naturally
a
division
into
three
parts
the
first
period
beginning
with
s
in
ended
with
in
the
second
contains
the
two
volumes
of
and
the
novel
that
he
wrote
in
collaboration
with
ford
madox
hueffer
and
ends
with
published
in
the
third
period
begins
after
a
long
pause
in
with
secret
and
receives
its
climax
with
the
remarkable
popularity
of
in
and
his
first
period
was
a
period
of
struggle
struggle
with
a
foreign
language
struggle
with
a
technique
that
was
always
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
schools
to
remain
too
strong
for
him
struggles
with
the
very
force
and
power
of
his
reminiscences
that
were
urging
themselves
upon
him
now
at
the
moment
of
their
contemplated
freedom
like
wild
beasts
behind
iron
bars
s
and
outcast
of
the
the
first
of
these
is
sequel
to
the
second
were
remarkable
in
the
freshness
of
their
discovery
of
a
new
world
it
was
not
that
their
world
had
not
been
found
before
but
rather
that
conrad
by
the
force
of
his
own
individual
discovery
proclaimed
his
find
with
a
new
voice
and
a
new
vigour
in
the
character
of
almayer
of
aissa
of
willems
of
bahalatchi
and
abdulla
there
was
a
new
psychology
that
gave
promise
of
great
things
nevertheless
these
early
stories
were
overcharged
with
atmosphere
were
clumsy
in
their
development
and
conveyed
in
then
style
a
sense
of
rhetoric
and
lack
of
ease
his
vision
of
his
background
was
pulled
out
beyond
its
natural
intensity
and
his
own
desire
to
make
it
overwhelming
was
so
obvious
as
to
frighten
the
creature
into
a
determination
to
be
simply
out
of
malicious
perversity
anything
else
these
two
novels
were
followed
by
a
volume
of
short
stories
of
that
reveal
quite
nakedly
conrad
s
difficulties
one
study
in
this
book
with
its
redundancies
and
overemphasis
is
the
crudest
parody
on
its
author
and
no
single
tale
in
the
volume
succeeds
it
was
however
as
though
with
these
efforts
conrad
flung
himself
free
for
ever
from
his
apprenticeship
there
appeared
in
what
remains
perhaps
still
his
most
perfect
work
nigger
of
the
this
was
a
story
entirely
of
the
sea
of
the
voyage
of
a
ship
from
port
to
port
and
of
the
influence
upon
that
ship
and
upon
the
human
souls
that
she
contained
of
the
approaching
shadow
of
death
an
influence
ironical
melancholy
never
quite
horrible
and
always
tender
and
humorous
conrad
must
himself
have
loved
beyond
all
other
vessels
the
never
again
except
perhaps
in
mirror
of
the
was
he
to
be
so
happily
at
his
ease
with
any
of
his
subjects
the
book
is
a
gallery
of
remarkably
distinct
and
authentic
portraits
the
atmosphere
is
held
in
perfect
restraint
and
the
overhanging
theme
is
never
for
an
instant
abandoned
it
is
above
all
a
record
of
lovingly
cherished
reminiscence
of
cherished
reminiscence
also
was
the
book
that
closed
the
first
period
of
his
work
this
was
to
remain
until
the
publication
of
his
most
popular
novel
it
is
the
story
of
a
young
englishman
s
loss
of
honour
in
a
moment
of
panic
and
his
victorious
recovery
the
first
half
of
the
book
is
a
finely
sustained
development
of
a
vividly
remembered
scene
the
second
half
has
the
inevitability
of
a
moral
idea
pursued
to
its
romantic
end
rather
than
the
inevitability
of
life
here
then
in
conrad
had
worked
himself
free
of
the
underground
of
the
jungle
and
was
able
to
choose
his
path
his
choice
was
still
dictated
by
the
subjects
that
he
remembered
most
vividly
but
upon
these
rewards
of
observation
his
creative
genius
was
working
james
wait
donkin
jim
marlowe
were
men
whom
he
had
known
but
men
also
to
whom
he
had
given
a
new
birth
there
appeared
now
in
heart
of
and
three
of
the
finest
short
stories
in
the
english
language
work
of
reminiscence
but
glowing
at
its
heart
with
all
the
lyrical
exultation
and
flame
of
a
passion
that
had
been
the
ruling
power
of
a
life
that
was
now
to
be
abandoned
that
salutation
of
farewell
is
in
and
its
evocation
of
the
east
in
heart
of
and
its
evocation
of
the
forests
that
are
beyond
civilisation
in
and
its
evocation
of
the
sea
he
was
never
after
these
tales
to
write
again
of
the
sea
as
though
he
were
still
sailing
on
it
from
this
time
he
belonged
with
regret
and
with
some
ironic
contempt
to
the
land
this
second
period
closed
with
the
production
of
a
work
that
was
deliberately
created
rather
than
reminiscent
conrad
may
have
known
dr
monyngham
decoud
mrs
could
old
viola
but
they
became
stronger
than
he
and
in
their
completed
personalities
owed
no
man
anything
for
their
creation
there
is
much
to
be
said
about
in
many
ways
the
greatest
of
all
conrad
s
works
but
for
the
moment
one
would
only
say
that
its
appearance
it
appeared
first
of
all
ironical
births
in
a
journal
s
and
astonished
and
bewildered
its
readers
week
by
week
by
its
determination
not
to
finish
and
yield
place
to
something
simpler
caused
no
comment
whatever
that
its
critics
did
not
understand
it
and
its
author
s
own
admirers
were
puzzled
by
its
unlikeness
to
the
earlier
sea
stories
was
followed
by
a
pause
one
can
easily
imagine
that
its
production
did
for
a
moment
utterly
exhaust
its
creator
when
however
in
appeared
secret
a
new
attitude
was
most
plainly
visible
he
was
suddenly
detached
writing
now
of
cases
that
interested
him
as
an
investigator
of
human
life
but
called
from
his
heart
no
burning
participation
of
experience
he
is
tender
towards
winnie
verloc
and
her
old
mother
the
two
women
in
secret
but
he
studies
them
quite
dispassionately
that
love
that
clothed
jim
so
radiantly
that
fierce
contempt
that
in
outcast
of
the
accompanied
willems
to
his
degraded
death
is
gone
we
have
the
finer
artist
but
we
have
lost
something
of
that
earlier
compelling
interest
secret
is
a
tale
of
secret
service
in
london
it
contains
the
wonderfully
created
figure
of
verloc
and
it
expresses
to
the
full
conrad
s
hatred
of
those
rows
and
rows
of
bricks
and
mortar
that
are
so
completely
accepted
by
unimaginative
men
in
western
spoke
strongly
of
a
russian
influence
turgéniev
and
dostoievsky
had
too
markedly
their
share
in
the
creation
of
razumov
and
the
cosmopolitan
circle
in
geneva
moreover
it
is
a
book
whose
heart
is
cold
a
volume
of
short
stories
set
of
illustrating
still
more
emphatically
conrad
s
new
detachment
appeared
in
and
is
remarkable
chiefly
for
an
ironically
humorous
story
of
the
napoleonic
wars
a
tale
too
long
perhaps
but
admirable
for
its
sustained
note
in
he
seemed
in
another
volume
twixt
land
and
to
unite
some
of
his
earlier
glow
with
all
his
later
mastery
of
his
method
smile
of
and
secret
are
amazing
in
the
beauty
of
retrospect
that
they
leave
behind
them
in
the
soul
of
the
reader
the
sea
is
once
more
revealed
to
us
but
it
is
revealed
now
as
something
that
conrad
has
conquered
his
contact
with
the
land
has
taken
from
him
something
of
his
earlier
intimacy
with
his
old
mistress
nevertheless
secret
is
a
most
marvellous
story
marvellous
in
its
completeness
of
theme
and
treatment
marvellous
in
the
contrast
between
the
confined
limitations
of
its
stage
and
the
vast
implications
of
its
moral
idea
finally
in
appeared
by
no
means
the
finest
of
his
books
but
catching
the
attention
and
admiration
of
that
wider
audience
who
had
remained
indifferent
to
the
force
and
beauty
of
nigger
of
the
of
of
with
the
popular
success
of
the
first
period
of
his
work
is
closed
on
the
possible
results
of
that
popularity
their
effect
on
the
artist
and
on
the
whole
world
of
men
one
must
offer
here
at
any
rate
no
prophecy
iii
to
any
reader
who
cares
seriously
to
study
the
art
of
joseph
conrad
no
better
advice
could
be
offered
than
that
he
should
begin
with
the
reading
of
the
two
volumes
that
have
been
omitted
from
the
preceding
list
and
mirror
of
the
demand
consideration
on
the
threshold
of
any
survey
of
this
author
s
work
because
they
reveal
from
a
personal
wilful
and
completely
anarchistic
angle
the
individuality
that
can
only
be
discovered
afterwards
objectively
in
the
process
of
creation
in
both
these
books
conrad
is
quite
simply
himself
for
anyone
who
cares
to
read
they
are
books
dictated
by
no
sense
of
precedent
nor
form
nor
fashion
they
are
books
of
their
own
kind
even
more
than
are
the
novels
has
only
for
its
rival
in
the
business
of
getting
everything
done
without
moving
a
step
forward
mirror
of
the
has
no
rival
at
all
we
may
suppose
that
the
author
did
really
intend
to
write
his
reminiscences
when
he
began
he
found
a
moment
that
would
make
a
good
a
moment
in
the
writing
of
his
first
book
s
at
the
conclusion
or
more
truly
cessation
of
that
moment
is
still
hanging
in
the
writing
of
has
not
proceeded
two
lines
farther
down
the
stage
the
is
still
standing
in
the
doorway
the
hands
of
the
clock
have
covered
five
minutes
of
the
dial
what
has
occurred
is
simply
that
the
fascination
of
the
subject
has
been
too
strong
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
conrad
s
art
that
one
thing
so
powerfully
suggests
to
him
another
that
to
start
him
on
anything
at
all
is
a
tragedy
because
life
is
so
short
his
reminiscences
would
be
easy
enough
to
command
would
they
only
not
take
on
a
life
of
their
own
and
shout
at
their
unfortunate
author
ah
yes
i
m
interesting
of
course
but
don
t
you
remember
the
whole
adventure
of
writing
his
first
book
is
crowded
with
incident
not
because
he
considers
it
a
wonderful
book
or
himself
a
marvellous
figure
but
simply
because
any
incident
in
the
world
must
in
his
eyes
be
crowded
about
with
other
incidents
there
is
the
pen
one
wrote
the
book
with
that
pen
that
belonged
to
poor
old
captain
b
of
the
who
or
there
is
the
window
just
behind
the
that
looked
out
into
the
river
that
river
that
reminds
one
of
the
year
when
in
the
course
of
his
thrilling
voyage
of
discovery
we
are
by
a
kind
of
most
blessed
miracle
told
something
of
mr
nicholas
and
of
the
author
s
own
most
fascinating
uncle
we
even
by
an
extension
of
the
miracle
learn
something
of
conrad
as
ship
s
officer
this
the
merest
glimpse
and
as
a
visitor
to
his
uncle
s
house
in
poland
so
by
chance
are
these
miraculous
facts
and
glimpses
that
we
catch
at
them
with
eager
extended
hands
praying
imploring
them
to
stay
indeed
those
glimpses
may
seem
to
us
the
more
wonderful
in
that
they
have
been
by
us
only
partially
realised
nevertheless
in
spite
of
its
eager
incoherence
at
the
same
time
both
breathless
and
by
the
virtue
of
its
author
s
style
solemn
we
do
obtain
in
addition
to
our
glimpses
of
poland
and
the
sea
one
or
two
revelations
of
conrad
himself
our
revelations
come
to
us
partly
through
our
impression
of
his
own
zest
for
life
a
zest
always
ironical
often
sceptical
but
always
eager
and
driven
by
a
throbbing
impulse
of
vitality
partly
also
through
certain
deliberate
utterances
he
tells
us
those
who
read
me
know
my
conviction
that
the
world
the
temporal
world
rests
on
a
few
very
simple
ideas
so
simple
that
they
must
be
as
old
as
the
hills
it
rests
notably
amongst
others
on
the
idea
of
fidelity
at
a
time
when
nothing
which
is
not
revolutionary
in
some
way
or
other
can
expect
to
attract
much
attention
i
have
not
been
revolutionary
in
my
page
or
again
all
claim
to
special
righteousness
awakens
in
me
that
scorn
and
anger
from
which
a
philosophical
mind
should
be
page
or
again
even
before
the
most
seductive
reveries
i
have
remained
mindful
of
that
sobriety
of
interior
life
that
asceticism
of
sentiment
in
which
alone
the
naked
form
of
truth
such
as
one
conceives
it
such
as
one
feels
it
can
be
rendered
without
page
this
simplicity
this
fidelity
this
hatred
of
and
this
sobriety
these
qualities
do
give
some
implication
of
the
colour
of
the
work
that
will
arise
from
them
and
when
to
these
qualities
we
add
that
zest
and
vigour
we
must
have
some
true
conception
of
the
nature
of
the
work
that
he
was
to
do
it
is
for
this
that
is
valuable
to
read
it
as
a
detached
work
to
expect
from
it
the
amiable
facetiousness
of
a
book
of
modern
memories
or
the
heavy
authoritative
coherence
of
the
or
of
some
eminent
scientist
or
theologian
is
to
be
most
grievously
disappointed
if
the
beginning
is
bewilderment
the
end
is
an
impression
of
crowding
disordered
life
of
a
tapestry
richly
dark
with
figures
woven
into
the
very
thread
of
it
and
yet
starting
to
life
with
an
individuality
all
their
own
no
book
reveals
more
clearly
the
reasons
both
of
conrad
s
faults
and
of
his
merits
no
book
of
his
is
more
likely
by
reason
of
its
honesty
and
simplicity
to
win
him
true
friends
as
a
work
of
art
there
is
almost
everything
to
be
said
against
it
except
that
it
has
that
supreme
gift
that
remains
at
the
end
almost
all
that
we
ask
of
any
work
of
art
overwhelming
vitality
but
it
is
formless
ragged
incoherent
inconclusive
a
fragment
of
eager
vivid
turbulent
reminiscence
poured
into
a
friend
s
ear
in
a
moment
of
sudden
confidence
that
may
or
may
not
be
the
best
way
to
conduct
reminiscences
the
book
remains
a
supremely
intimate
engaging
and
enlightening
introduction
to
its
author
with
mirror
of
the
we
are
on
very
different
ground
as
i
have
already
said
this
is
conrad
s
happiest
book
indeed
with
the
possible
exception
of
nigger
of
the
his
only
happy
book
he
is
happy
because
he
is
able
for
a
moment
to
forget
his
distrust
his
dread
his
inherent
ironical
pessimism
he
is
here
permitting
himself
the
whole
range
of
his
enthusiasm
and
admiration
and
behind
that
enthusiasm
there
is
a
quiet
sure
confidence
that
is
strangely
at
variance
with
the
distrust
of
his
later
novels
the
book
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
a
collection
of
almost
haphazard
papers
with
such
titles
as
and
and
missing
rulers
of
east
and
west
the
nursery
of
the
no
reader
however
can
conclude
it
without
having
conveyed
to
him
a
strangely
binding
impression
of
unity
he
has
been
led
it
will
seem
to
him
mto
the
very
heart
of
the
company
of
those
who
know
the
sea
as
she
really
is
he
has
been
made
free
of
a
great
order
the
foundation
of
his
intimacy
springs
from
three
sources
the
majesty
power
and
cruelty
of
the
sea
herself
the
homely
reality
of
the
lives
of
the
men
who
serve
her
the
vibrating
beautiful
life
of
the
ships
that
sail
upon
her
this
is
the
trilogy
that
holds
in
its
hands
the
whole
life
and
pageant
of
the
sea
it
is
because
conrad
holds
all
three
elements
in
exact
and
perfect
balance
that
this
book
has
its
unique
value
its
power
both
of
realism
for
this
is
the
life
of
man
and
of
romance
which
is
the
life
of
the
sea
conrad
s
attitude
to
the
sea
herself
in
this
book
is
one
of
lyrical
and
passionate
worship
he
sees
with
all
the
vivid
accuracy
of
his
realism
her
deceits
her
cruelties
her
inhuman
disregard
of
the
lives
of
men
but
finally
her
glory
is
enough
for
him
he
will
write
of
her
like
this
the
sea
this
truth
must
be
confessed
has
no
generosity
no
display
of
manly
qualities
courage
hardihood
endurance
faithfulness
has
ever
been
known
to
touch
its
irresponsible
consciousness
of
power
the
ocean
has
the
conscienceless
temper
of
a
savage
autocrat
spoiled
by
much
adulation
he
can
not
brook
the
slightest
appearance
of
defiance
and
has
remained
the
irreconcilable
enemy
of
ships
and
men
ever
since
ships
and
men
had
the
audacity
to
go
afloat
together
in
the
face
of
his
frown
the
most
amazing
wonder
of
the
deep
is
its
unfathomable
nevertheless
she
holds
him
her
most
willing
slave
and
he
is
that
because
he
believes
that
she
alone
in
all
the
world
is
worthy
to
indulge
this
cruelty
she
positively
brings
it
off
this
assertion
of
her
right
and
once
he
is
assured
of
that
he
will
yield
absolute
obedience
in
this
worship
of
the
sea
and
the
winds
that
rouse
her
he
allows
himself
a
lyrical
freedom
that
he
was
afterwards
to
check
he
was
never
again
not
even
in
and
to
write
with
such
free
and
spontaneous
lyricism
as
in
his
famous
passage
about
the
west
mirror
of
the
forms
then
the
best
possible
introduction
to
conrad
s
work
because
it
attests
more
magnificently
and
more
confidently
than
anything
else
that
he
has
written
his
faith
and
his
devotion
it
presents
also
however
in
its
treatment
of
the
second
element
of
his
subject
the
men
on
the
ships
many
early
sketches
of
the
characters
whom
he
both
before
and
afterwards
developed
so
fully
in
his
novels
about
these
same
men
there
are
certain
characteristics
to
be
noticed
characteristics
that
must
be
treated
more
fully
in
a
later
analysis
of
conrad
s
creative
power
but
that
nevertheless
demand
some
mention
here
as
witnesses
of
the
emotions
the
humours
the
passions
that
he
most
naturally
observes
it
is
in
the
first
place
to
be
marked
that
almost
all
the
men
upon
the
sea
from
poor
captain
b
who
used
to
suffer
from
sick
headaches
in
his
young
days
every
time
he
was
approaching
a
coast
to
the
dramatic
dominic
from
the
slow
imperturbable
gravity
of
that
man
you
would
think
he
had
never
smiled
in
his
life
are
silent
and
thoughtful
granted
this
silence
conrad
in
his
survey
is
instantly
attracted
by
any
possible
contrast
captain
b
dying
in
his
home
with
two
grave
elderly
women
sitting
beside
him
in
the
quiet
room
his
eyes
resting
fondly
upon
the
faces
in
the
room
upon
the
pictures
on
the
wall
upon
all
the
familiar
objects
of
that
home
whose
abiding
and
clear
image
must
have
flashed
often
on
his
memory
in
times
of
stress
and
anxiety
at
sea
poor
p
with
his
cheery
temper
his
admiration
for
the
jokes
in
his
little
oddities
like
his
strange
passion
for
borrowing
for
instance
that
captain
who
did
everything
with
an
air
which
put
your
attention
on
the
alert
and
raised
your
expectations
but
the
result
somehow
was
always
on
stereotyped
lines
unsuggestive
empty
of
any
lesson
that
one
could
lay
to
heart
that
other
captain
in
whom
through
a
touch
of
that
modest
artist
of
solid
merit
became
untrue
to
his
temperament
here
are
little
sketches
for
those
portraits
that
afterwards
we
are
to
know
so
well
marlowe
captain
m
whirr
captain
lingard
captain
mitchell
and
many
others
here
we
may
fancy
that
his
eye
lingers
as
though
in
the
mere
enumeration
of
little
oddities
and
contrasted
qualities
he
sees
such
themes
such
subjects
such
cases
that
it
is
hard
almost
beyond
discipline
to
leave
them
nevertheless
they
have
to
be
left
he
has
obtained
his
broader
contrast
by
his
juxtaposition
of
the
curious
muddled
jumble
of
the
human
life
against
the
broad
august
power
of
the
sea
that
is
all
that
his
present
subject
demands
that
is
his
theme
and
his
picture
not
all
his
theme
however
there
remains
the
third
element
in
it
the
soul
of
the
ship
it
is
perhaps
after
all
with
the
life
of
the
ship
that
mirror
of
the
ultimately
has
most
to
do
as
other
men
write
of
the
woman
they
have
loved
so
does
conrad
write
of
his
ships
he
sees
them
in
this
book
that
is
so
especially
dedicated
to
their
pride
and
beauty
coloured
with
a
fine
glow
of
romance
but
nevertheless
he
realises
them
with
all
the
accurate
detail
of
a
technician
who
describes
his
craft
you
may
learn
of
the
raising
and
letting
go
of
an
anchor
and
he
will
tell
the
journalists
of
their
crime
in
speaking
of
casting
an
anchor
when
the
true
technicality
is
brought
up
to
an
anchor
understood
in
the
chapter
on
yachts
he
provides
as
much
technical
detail
as
any
book
of
instruction
need
demand
and
then
suddenly
there
come
these
sentences
the
art
of
handling
slips
is
finer
perhaps
than
the
art
of
handling
a
ship
is
a
creature
which
we
have
brought
into
the
world
as
it
were
on
purpose
to
keep
us
up
to
indeed
it
is
the
ship
that
gives
that
final
impression
of
unity
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
to
the
book
she
grows
as
it
were
from
her
birth
in
no
ordered
sequence
of
events
but
admitting
us
ever
more
closely
into
her
intimacy
telling
us
at
first
shyly
afterwards
more
boldly
little
things
about
herself
confiding
to
us
her
trials
appealing
sometimes
to
our
admiration
indulging
sometimes
our
humour
conrad
is
tender
to
her
as
he
is
to
nothing
human
he
watches
her
shy
new
in
the
dock
her
reputation
all
to
make
yet
in
the
talk
of
the
seamen
who
were
to
share
their
life
with
she
looked
modest
to
me
i
imagined
her
diffident
lying
very
quiet
with
her
side
nestling
shyly
against
the
wharf
to
which
she
was
made
fast
with
very
new
lines
intimidated
by
the
company
of
her
tried
and
experienced
bisters
already
familiar
with
all
the
violences
of
the
ocean
and
the
exacting
love
of
her
friend
stands
there
on
the
quay
and
bids
her
be
of
good
courage
he
salutes
her
grace
and
spirit
he
echoes
with
all
the
implied
irony
of
contrast
his
companion
s
ships
are
all
right
he
explains
the
many
kinds
of
ships
that
there
are
the
rogues
the
wickedly
malicious
the
sly
the
benevolent
the
proud
the
adventurous
the
staid
the
decorous
for
even
the
worst
of
these
he
has
indulgences
that
he
would
never
offer
to
the
soul
of
man
he
can
not
be
severe
before
such
a
world
of
fine
spirits
finally
in
the
episode
of
the
and
her
tragic
end
an
end
that
has
in
it
a
suggestion
of
that
later
story
of
the
seven
in
that
sinister
adventure
of
dominic
and
the
vile
caesar
he
shows
us
in
miniature
what
it
is
that
he
intends
to
do
with
all
this
material
he
gives
us
the
soul
of
the
the
soul
of
dominic
the
soul
of
the
sea
upon
which
they
are
voyaging
without
ever
deserting
the
realism
upon
which
he
builds
his
foundations
he
raises
upon
it
his
house
of
romance
this
book
remains
by
far
the
easiest
the
kindest
the
most
friendly
of
all
his
books
he
has
been
troubled
here
by
no
questions
of
form
of
creation
of
development
whether
of
character
or
of
incident
it
is
the
best
of
all
possible
prologues
to
his
more
creative
work
ii
the
novelist
i
discussing
the
art
of
any
novelist
as
distinct
from
the
poet
or
essayist
there
are
three
special
questions
that
we
may
ask
as
to
the
theme
as
to
the
form
as
to
the
creation
of
character
it
is
possible
to
discuss
these
three
questions
in
terms
that
can
be
applied
in
no
fashion
whatever
to
the
poem
or
the
essay
although
the
novel
may
often
more
truly
belong
to
the
essay
or
the
poem
to
the
novel
as
for
instance
ring
and
the
and
bear
witness
all
such
questions
of
ultimate
classes
and
divisions
are
vain
but
these
three
divisions
of
theme
form
and
character
do
cover
many
of
the
questions
that
are
to
be
asked
about
any
novelist
simply
in
his
position
as
novelist
and
nothing
else
that
joseph
conrad
is
in
his
art
most
truly
poet
as
well
as
novelist
no
reader
of
his
work
will
deny
i
wish
in
this
chapter
to
consider
him
simply
as
a
novelist
that
is
as
a
narrator
of
the
histories
of
certain
human
beings
with
his
attitude
to
those
histories
concerning
the
form
of
the
novel
the
english
novelists
until
the
seventies
and
eighties
of
the
nineteenth
century
worried
themselves
but
slightly
if
they
considered
the
matter
they
chuckled
over
their
deliberate
freedom
as
did
sterne
and
fielding
scott
considered
a
jolly
business
in
which
one
was
also
happily
able
to
make
a
fine
living
but
he
never
contemplated
the
matter
with
any
respect
jane
austen
who
had
as
much
form
as
any
modern
novelist
was
quite
unaware
of
her
happy
possession
the
gloriously
abandoned
themselves
to
the
rich
independence
of
shilling
numbers
a
fashion
which
forbade
form
as
completely
as
the
manners
of
the
time
forbade
frankness
a
new
period
began
at
the
end
of
the
fifties
but
no
one
in
was
aware
that
a
novel
called
was
of
any
special
importance
it
made
no
more
stir
than
did
s
in
the
early
nineties
although
the
wonderful
had
already
preceded
it
with
the
coming
of
george
meredith
and
thomas
hardy
the
form
of
the
novel
springing
straight
from
the
shores
of
france
where
and
showed
what
might
be
done
by
taking
trouble
grew
into
a
question
of
considerable
import
robert
louis
stevenson
showed
how
important
it
was
to
say
things
agreeably
even
when
you
had
not
very
much
to
say
henry
james
showed
that
there
was
so
much
to
say
about
everything
that
you
could
not
possibly
get
to
the
end
of
it
and
rudyard
kipling
showed
that
the
great
thing
was
to
see
things
as
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineties
everyone
was
immensely
busied
over
the
way
that
things
were
done
yellow
sprang
into
a
bright
existence
flamed
and
died
art
for
art
s
sake
was
slain
by
the
trial
of
oscar
wilde
in
mr
wells
in
addition
to
fantastic
romances
wrote
stories
about
shop
assistants
and
knew
something
about
biology
the
fabian
society
made
socialism
entertaining
mr
bernard
shaw
foreshadowed
a
new
period
and
the
boer
war
completed
an
old
one
of
the
whole
question
of
conrad
s
place
in
the
history
of
the
english
novel
and
his
influence
upon
it
i
wish
to
speak
in
a
later
chapter
i
would
simply
say
here
that
if
he
was
borne
in
upon
the
wind
of
the
french
influence
he
was
himself
in
later
years
one
of
the
chief
agents
in
its
destruction
but
beginning
to
write
in
english
as
he
did
in
the
time
of
yellow
passing
through
all
the
realistic
reaction
that
followed
the
collapse
of
aestheticism
seeing
the
old
period
washed
away
by
the
storm
of
the
boer
war
he
had
especially
prepared
for
him
a
new
stage
upon
which
to
labour
the
time
and
the
season
were
ideal
for
the
work
that
he
had
to
do
ii
the
form
in
which
conrad
has
chosen
to
develop
his
narratives
is
the
question
which
must
always
come
first
in
any
consideration
of
him
as
a
novelist
the
question
of
his
form
is
the
ground
upon
which
he
has
been
most
frequently
attacked
his
difficulties
in
this
matter
have
all
arisen
as
i
have
already
suggested
from
his
absorbing
interest
in
life
let
us
imagine
for
an
instant
an
imaginary
case
he
has
teen
in
some
foreign
port
a
quarrel
between
two
seamen
one
has
knifed
the
other
and
the
quarrel
has
been
watched
with
complete
indifference
by
a
young
girl
and
a
bibulous
old
wastrel
who
is
obviously
a
relation
both
of
hers
and
of
the
stricken
seaman
the
author
sees
here
a
case
for
his
art
and
wishing
to
give
us
the
matter
with
the
greatest
possible
truth
and
accuracy
he
begins
by
the
narration
of
a
little
barber
whose
shop
is
just
over
the
spot
where
the
quarrel
took
place
and
whose
lodgers
the
old
man
and
the
girl
are
he
describes
the
little
barber
and
is
at
once
amazed
by
the
interesting
facts
that
he
discovers
about
the
man
seen
standing
in
his
doorway
he
is
the
most
ordinary
little
figure
but
once
investigate
his
case
and
you
find
a
strange
contrast
between
his
melancholy
romanticism
and
the
flashing
fanaticism
of
his
love
for
the
young
girl
who
lodges
with
him
that
leads
one
back
through
many
years
to
the
moment
of
his
first
meeting
with
the
bibulous
old
man
and
for
a
witness
of
that
wo
must
hunt
out
a
villainous
old
woman
who
keeps
a
drinking
saloon
in
another
part
of
the
town
this
old
woman
now
so
and
degraded
had
once
a
history
of
her
own
once
she
was
and
so
the
matter
continues
it
is
not
so
much
a
deliberate
evocation
of
the
most
difficult
of
methods
this
maimer
of
narration
as
a
poignant
witness
to
conrad
s
own
breathless
surprise
at
his
discoveries
mr
henry
james
speaking
of
this
enforced
collection
of
oratorical
witnesses
says
it
places
mr
conrad
absolutely
alone
as
a
votary
of
the
way
to
do
a
thing
that
shall
make
it
undergo
most
doing
and
his
amazement
at
conrad
s
patient
pursuit
of
unneeded
difficulties
may
seem
to
us
the
stranger
if
we
consider
that
in
maisie
and
awkward
he
has
practised
almost
precisely
the
same
form
himself
indeed
beside
the
intricate
but
masterly
form
of
awkward
the
duplicate
narration
of
seems
child
s
play
mr
henry
james
makes
the
mistake
of
speaking
as
though
conrad
had
quite
deliberately
chosen
the
form
of
narration
that
was
most
difficult
to
him
simply
for
the
fun
of
overcoming
the
difficulties
the
truth
being
that
he
has
chosen
the
easiest
the
form
of
narration
brought
straight
from
the
sea
and
the
ships
that
he
adored
the
form
of
narration
used
by
the
ancient
mariner
and
all
the
seamen
before
and
alter
him
conrad
must
have
his
direct
narrator
because
that
is
the
way
in
which
stories
in
the
past
had
generally
come
to
him
he
wishes
to
deny
the
effect
of
that
direct
and
simple
honesty
that
had
always
seemed
so
attractive
to
him
he
must
have
it
by
word
of
mouth
because
it
is
by
word
of
mouth
that
he
himself
has
always
demanded
it
and
if
one
witness
is
not
enough
for
the
truth
of
it
then
must
he
have
two
or
three
consider
for
a
moment
the
form
of
three
of
his
most
important
novels
jim
and
it
is
possible
that
was
conceived
originally
as
a
sketch
of
character
derived
by
the
author
from
one
scene
that
was
in
all
probability
an
actual
reminiscence
certainly
when
the
book
is
finished
one
scene
beyond
all
others
remains
with
the
reader
the
scene
of
the
inquiry
into
the
loss
of
the
or
rather
the
vision
of
jim
and
his
appalling
companions
waiting
outside
for
the
inquiry
to
begin
simply
in
the
contemplation
of
these
four
men
conrad
has
his
desired
contrast
the
skipper
of
the
he
made
me
think
of
a
trained
baby
elephant
walking
on
he
was
extravagantly
gorgeous
too
got
up
in
soiled
bright
green
and
deep
orange
vertical
stripes
with
a
pair
of
ragged
straw
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
and
somebody
s
pith
hat
very
dirty
and
two
sizes
too
small
for
him
tied
up
with
a
manilla
on
the
top
of
his
big
there
are
also
two
other
chaps
with
him
a
sallow
faced
mean
little
chap
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
a
long
individual
in
a
blue
flannel
coat
as
dry
as
a
chip
and
no
stouter
than
a
broomstick
with
drooping
grey
moustaches
who
looked
about
him
with
an
air
of
jaunty
imbecility
and
with
these
three
jim
firm
on
his
feet
as
promising
a
boy
as
the
sun
ever
shone
here
are
these
four
in
the
same
box
condemned
for
ever
by
all
men
that
boy
in
the
same
box
as
those
obscene
scoundrels
at
once
the
artist
has
fastened
on
to
his
subject
it
bristles
with
active
vital
possibilities
and
discoveries
we
the
observers
share
the
artist
s
thrill
we
watch
our
author
dart
upon
a
subject
with
the
excitement
of
adventurers
discovering
a
gold
mine
how
much
will
it
yield
how
deep
will
it
go
we
are
thrilled
with
the
suspense
conrad
having
discovered
his
subject
must
for
the
satisfaction
of
that
honour
which
is
his
most
deeply
cherished
virtue
prove
to
us
his
authenticity
i
was
not
there
myself
he
tells
us
but
i
can
show
you
someone
who
he
introduces
us
to
a
witness
marlowe
or
another
now
tell
your
he
has
at
once
the
atmosphere
in
which
he
is
happiest
and
so
having
his
audience
clustered
about
him
unlimited
time
at
everyone
s
disposal
whiskies
and
cigars
without
stint
he
lets
himself
go
he
is
bothered
now
by
no
question
but
the
thorough
investigation
of
his
discovery
what
had
jim
done
that
he
should
be
in
such
a
case
we
must
have
the
story
of
the
loss
of
the
that
marvellous
journey
across
the
waters
all
the
world
of
the
pilgrims
the
obscene
captain
and
jim
s
fine
chivalrous
soul
marlowe
is
inexhaustible
he
has
so
much
to
say
and
so
many
fine
words
in
which
to
say
it
at
present
so
absorbed
are
we
so
successful
is
he
that
we
are
completely
held
the
illusion
is
perfect
we
come
to
the
inquiry
one
of
the
judges
is
captain
brierley
what
not
know
captain
brierley
ah
but
i
must
tell
you
most
extraordinary
thing
the
world
grows
around
us
a
world
that
can
contain
the
captain
of
the
brierley
and
jim
at
the
same
time
the
subject
before
us
seems
now
so
rich
that
we
are
expecting
to
see
it
burst
at
any
moment
in
the
author
s
hands
but
so
long
as
that
first
visualised
scene
is
the
centre
of
the
episode
so
long
as
the
experience
hovers
round
that
inquiry
and
the
esplanade
outside
it
we
are
held
breathless
and
believing
we
believe
even
in
the
eloquent
marlowe
then
the
moment
passes
every
possible
probe
into
its
heart
has
been
made
we
are
satisfied
there
follows
then
the
sequel
and
here
at
once
the
weakness
of
the
method
is
apparent
the
author
having
created
his
narrator
must
continue
with
him
marlowe
is
there
untired
eager
waiting
to
begin
again
but
the
trouble
is
that
we
are
do
longer
assured
now
of
the
truth
and
reality
of
his
story
he
saw
we
can
not
for
an
instant
doubt
it
that
group
on
the
esplanade
all
that
he
could
tell
us
about
that
we
breathlessly
awaited
but
now
we
are
uncertain
whether
he
is
not
inventing
a
romantic
sequel
he
must
go
on
that
is
the
truly
terrible
thing
about
marlowe
and
at
the
moment
when
we
question
his
authenticity
we
are
suspicious
of
his
very
existence
ready
to
be
irritated
by
his
flow
of
words
demanding
something
more
authentic
than
that
voice
that
is
now
only
dimly
heard
the
author
himself
perhaps
feels
this
he
duplicates
he
even
trebles
his
narrators
and
with
each
fresh
agent
raises
a
fresh
crop
of
facts
contrasts
halts
and
histories
that
then
is
the
peril
of
the
method
whilst
we
believe
we
are
completely
held
but
let
the
authenticity
waver
for
a
moment
and
the
danger
of
disaster
is
more
excessive
than
with
any
other
possible
form
of
narration
create
your
authority
and
we
have
at
once
someone
at
whom
we
may
throw
stones
if
we
are
not
beguiled
marlowe
has
certainly
been
compelled
to
face
at
moments
in
his
career
an
angry
irritated
audience
is
for
the
reason
that
we
never
lose
our
confidence
in
the
narrator
a
triumphant
vindication
of
these
methods
that
is
not
to
deny
that
is
extremely
contused
in
places
but
it
is
a
confusion
that
arises
rather
from
conrad
s
confidence
in
the
reader
s
of
the
facts
than
in
a
complication
of
narrations
the
narrations
are
sometimes
complicated
old
captain
mitchell
does
not
always
achieve
authenticity
but
on
the
whole
the
reader
may
be
said
to
be
puzzled
simply
because
he
is
told
so
much
about
some
things
and
so
little
about
others
but
this
assurance
of
the
author
s
that
we
must
have
already
learnt
the
main
facts
of
the
case
comes
from
his
own
convinced
sense
of
the
reality
of
it
this
time
he
has
no
marlowe
he
was
there
himself
of
course
he
says
to
us
you
know
all
about
that
revolution
in
sulaco
that
revolution
that
the
goulds
were
mixed
up
with
well
i
happened
to
be
there
myself
i
know
all
the
people
concerned
and
the
central
figure
was
not
gould
nor
mitchell
nor
monyngham
no
it
was
a
man
about
whom
no
one
outside
the
republic
was
told
a
syllable
i
knew
the
man
well
and
there
we
all
the
method
is
in
this
case
as
i
have
already
said
completely
successful
there
may
be
confusions
there
may
be
scenes
concerning
which
we
may
be
expected
to
be
told
much
and
are
in
truth
told
nothing
at
all
but
these
confusions
and
omissions
do
in
the
end
only
add
to
our
conviction
of
the
veracity
of
it
no
one
after
a
faithful
perusal
of
can
possibly
doubt
of
the
existence
of
sulaco
of
the
silver
mine
of
nostromo
and
decoud
of
mrs
gould
antonio
the
viola
girls
of
old
viola
hirsch
monyngham
gould
sotillo
of
the
death
of
viola
s
wife
of
the
expedition
at
night
in
the
painter
of
decoud
alone
on
the
isabels
of
hirsch
s
torture
of
captain
mitchell
s
watch
here
are
characters
the
most
romantic
in
the
world
scenes
that
would
surely
in
any
other
hands
be
fantastic
melodrama
and
both
characters
and
scenes
are
absolutely
supported
on
the
foundation
of
realistic
truth
not
for
a
moment
from
the
first
page
to
the
last
do
we
consciously
doubt
the
author
s
word
here
the
form
of
narration
is
vindicated
because
it
is
entirely
convincing
not
so
with
the
third
example
here
as
with
we
may
find
one
visualised
moment
that
stands
for
the
whole
book
and
as
in
the
earlier
work
we
look
back
and
see
the
degraded
officers
of
the
waiting
with
jim
on
the
esplanade
so
our
glance
back
over
reveals
to
us
that
moment
when
the
fynes
from
the
security
of
their
comfortable
home
watch
flora
de
barrel
flying
down
the
steps
of
her
horrible
brighton
house
as
though
the
furies
pursued
her
that
desperate
flight
is
the
key
of
the
book
the
moment
of
the
chivalrous
captain
anthony
s
rescue
of
flora
from
a
world
too
villainous
for
her
and
too
for
him
gives
the
book
s
theme
and
never
in
all
the
stories
that
preceded
flora
s
has
conrad
been
so
eager
to
afford
us
witnesses
we
have
in
the
first
place
the
unquenchable
marlowe
sitting
with
fine
phrases
at
his
lips
in
a
riverside
inn
to
him
enter
powell
who
once
served
with
captain
anthony
to
these
two
add
the
little
fynes
there
surely
you
have
enough
to
secure
your
alliance
but
it
is
precisely
the
number
of
witnesses
that
frightens
us
marlowe
unaided
would
have
been
enough
for
us
more
than
enough
if
we
are
to
consider
the
author
himself
as
a
possible
narrator
but
not
only
does
the
number
frighten
us
it
positively
hides
from
us
the
figures
of
captain
anthony
and
flora
de
barrel
both
the
knight
and
the
maiden
as
the
author
names
them
are
retiring
souls
and
our
hearts
move
in
sympathy
fin
them
as
we
contemplate
their
timid
hesitancy
before
the
voluble
inquisitions
of
marlowe
young
powell
and
the
fynes
moreover
the
intention
of
this
method
that
it
should
secure
realistic
conviction
for
the
most
romantic
episodes
does
not
here
achieve
its
purpose
as
we
have
seen
that
it
did
in
the
first
half
of
and
the
whole
of
we
believe
most
emphatically
in
that
first
narration
of
young
powell
s
about
his
first
chance
we
believe
in
the
first
narration
of
marlowe
although
quite
casually
he
talks
like
this
i
do
not
even
think
that
there
was
in
what
he
did
a
conscious
and
lofty
confidence
in
himself
a
particularly
pronounced
sense
of
power
which
leads
men
so
often
into
impossible
or
equivocal
we
believe
in
the
horrible
governess
a
fiercely
drawn
figure
we
believe
in
marlowe
s
interview
with
flora
on
the
pavement
outside
anthony
s
room
we
believe
in
the
whole
of
the
first
half
of
the
book
but
even
here
we
are
conscious
that
we
would
prefer
to
be
closer
to
the
whole
thing
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
hear
flora
and
anthony
speak
for
themselves
that
we
resent
a
little
marlowe
s
intimacy
which
prevents
with
patronising
complaisance
the
intimacy
that
we
the
readers
might
have
seemed
nevertheless
we
are
so
far
held
we
are
captured
but
when
the
second
half
of
the
book
arrives
we
can
be
confident
no
longer
here
as
in
it
is
possible
to
feel
that
conrad
having
surprised
seized
upon
mastered
his
original
moment
did
not
know
how
to
continue
it
the
true
thing
in
is
the
affair
of
the
the
true
thing
in
is
captain
anthony
s
rescue
of
flora
after
her
disaster
but
whereas
in
the
sequel
to
jim
s
cowardice
has
its
own
fine
qualities
of
beauty
and
imagination
the
sequel
to
captain
anthony
s
rescue
of
flora
seems
to
one
listener
at
any
rate
a
pitiably
unconvincing
climax
of
huddled
melodrama
that
chapter
in
entitled
moonless
is
in
the
first
half
of
it
surely
the
worst
thing
that
conrad
ever
wrote
save
only
that
one
early
short
story
the
conclusion
of
and
certain
tales
in
his
volume
the
make
one
wonder
whether
that
alliance
between
romance
and
realism
that
he
has
hitherto
so
wonderfully
maintained
is
not
breaking
down
before
the
baleful
strength
of
the
former
of
these
two
qualities
it
remains
only
to
be
said
that
when
credence
so
entirely
fails
as
it
must
before
the
end
of
the
form
of
narration
in
is
nothing
less
than
maddening
suddenly
we
do
not
believe
in
marlowe
in
powell
in
the
fynes
we
do
not
believe
even
in
anthony
and
flora
we
are
the
angrier
because
earlier
in
the
evening
we
were
so
completely
taken
in
it
is
as
though
we
had
given
our
money
to
a
deserving
cause
and
discovered
a
charlatan
i
have
described
at
length
the
form
in
which
the
themes
of
these
books
are
developed
because
it
is
the
form
that
here
extensively
here
quite
unobtrusively
clothes
all
the
novels
and
tales
we
are
caught
and
held
by
the
skinny
finger
of
the
ancient
mariner
when
he
has
a
true
tale
to
tell
us
his
veritable
presence
is
an
added
zest
to
our
pleasure
but
if
his
presence
be
not
true
iii
if
we
turn
to
the
themes
that
engage
joseph
conrad
s
attention
we
shall
see
that
in
almost
every
case
his
subjects
are
concerned
with
unequal
combats
unequal
to
his
own
vision
but
never
to
the
human
souls
engaged
in
them
and
it
is
this
consciousness
of
the
blindness
that
renders
men
s
honesty
and
heroism
of
so
little
account
that
gives
occasion
for
his
irony
he
chooses
in
almost
every
case
the
most
solid
and
unimaginative
of
human
beings
for
his
heroes
and
it
seems
that
it
is
these
men
alone
whom
he
can
admire
if
a
human
soul
has
vision
he
simply
gives
the
thing
up
we
can
hear
him
say
he
can
see
at
once
that
the
odds
are
too
strong
for
him
but
these
simple
souls
with
their
consciousness
of
the
job
before
them
and
nothing
else
with
their
placid
sense
of
honour
and
of
duty
upon
them
you
may
loosen
all
heaven
s
bolts
and
lightnings
and
they
will
not
they
command
his
pity
his
reverence
his
tenderness
almost
his
love
but
at
the
end
with
an
ironic
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
says
you
see
i
told
you
so
he
may
even
think
he
has
won
we
know
better
you
and
the
theme
of
s
is
a
struggle
of
a
weak
man
against
nature
of
nigger
of
the
the
struggle
of
many
simple
men
against
the
presence
of
death
of
again
the
struggle
of
a
simple
man
against
nature
here
the
man
wins
but
only
we
feel
at
the
cost
of
truth
the
conquest
of
a
child
of
nature
by
the
silver
mine
which
stands
over
him
conscious
of
its
ultimate
victory
from
the
very
first
the
struggle
of
an
absolutely
simple
and
upright
soul
against
the
dishonesties
of
a
world
that
he
does
not
understand
the
very
epitome
of
conrad
s
themes
is
the
struggle
of
m
whirr
against
the
storm
here
again
it
is
m
whirr
who
apparently
wins
but
we
can
hear
in
the
very
last
line
of
the
book
the
storm
s
confident
chuckle
of
ultimate
victory
in
of
the
victory
is
to
the
forest
in
end
of
the
captain
whalley
one
of
conrad
s
finest
figures
is
beaten
by
the
very
loftiness
of
his
character
the
three
tales
in
twixt
land
and
are
all
themes
of
this
kind
the
struggle
of
simple
unimaginative
men
against
forces
too
strong
for
them
in
secret
winnie
verloc
another
simple
character
finds
life
too
much
for
her
and
commits
suicide
in
western
razumov
the
dreamer
is
destroyed
by
a
world
that
laughs
at
the
pains
and
struggles
of
insignificant
individuals
of
conrad
s
philosophy
i
must
speak
in
another
place
here
it
is
enough
to
say
that
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
him
choosing
as
the
character
of
a
story
jolly
independent
souls
who
take
life
for
what
it
gives
them
and
leave
defeat
or
victory
to
the
stars
whatever
conrad
s
books
are
or
are
not
it
may
safely
be
said
that
they
are
never
jolly
and
his
most
devoted
disciple
would
in
all
probability
resent
any
suggestion
of
a
lighter
hand
or
a
gentler
affection
his
art
nevertheless
is
limited
by
this
persistent
brooding
over
the
inequality
of
life
s
battle
his
humour
often
of
a
very
fine
kind
is
always
sinister
because
his
choice
of
theme
forbids
tom
jones
and
tristram
shandy
would
have
found
marlowe
jim
and
captain
anthony
quite
impossibly
solemn
company
but
i
do
not
deny
that
they
might
not
have
been
something
the
better
for
a
little
of
it
i
have
already
said
that
his
characters
are
for
the
most
part
simple
and
unimaginative
men
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
are
so
simple
that
there
is
nothing
in
them
the
first
thing
of
which
one
is
sure
in
meeting
a
number
of
conrad
s
characters
is
that
they
have
existences
and
histories
entirely
independent
of
their
introducer
s
kind
offices
conrad
has
met
them
has
talked
to
them
has
come
to
know
them
but
we
are
sure
not
only
that
there
is
very
much
more
that
he
could
tell
us
about
them
if
he
had
time
and
space
but
that
even
when
he
had
told
us
all
that
he
knew
he
would
only
have
touched
on
the
fringe
of
their
real
histories
one
of
the
distinctions
between
the
modern
english
novel
and
the
english
novel
is
that
modern
characters
have
but
little
of
the
robust
vitality
of
their
predecessors
the
figures
in
the
novel
of
fade
so
easily
from
the
page
that
endeavours
to
keep
them
in
the
novels
of
mr
henry
james
we
feel
at
times
that
the
characters
fade
before
the
motives
attributed
to
them
in
those
of
mr
wells
before
an
idea
a
curse
or
a
remedy
in
those
of
mr
bennett
before
a
creeping
wilderness
of
important
insignificances
in
those
of
mr
galsworthy
before
the
oppression
of
social
inequalities
in
those
of
mrs
wharton
before
the
shadow
of
mr
henry
james
even
in
those
of
mr
hardy
before
the
omnipotence
of
an
inevitable
god
whom
in
spite
of
his
inevitability
mr
hardy
himself
is
arranging
in
the
background
it
may
be
claimed
for
the
characters
of
mr
conrad
that
they
yield
their
solidity
to
no
force
no
power
not
even
to
their
author
s
own
determination
that
they
are
doomed
in
the
end
to
defeat
this
is
not
for
a
moment
to
say
that
joseph
conrad
is
a
finer
novelist
than
these
others
but
this
quality
he
has
beyond
his
contemporaries
namely
the
assurance
that
his
characters
have
their
lives
and
adventures
both
before
and
after
the
especial
cases
that
he
is
describing
to
us
the
russian
tchekov
has
in
his
plays
this
gift
supremely
so
that
at
the
close
of
three
or
cherry
we
are
left
speculating
deeply
upon
what
happened
afterwards
to
gayef
or
barbara
to
masha
or
epikhadov
with
conrad
s
sea
captains
as
with
tchekov
s
russians
we
see
at
once
that
they
are
entirely
independent
of
the
incidents
that
we
are
told
about
them
this
independence
springs
partly
from
the
author
s
eager
almost
naïve
curiosity
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
introduce
us
to
any
officer
on
his
ship
without
whispering
to
us
in
an
aside
details
about
his
life
his
wife
and
family
on
shore
by
so
doing
he
forges
an
extra
link
in
his
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
but
we
do
not
feel
that
here
he
is
deliberately
serving
his
art
it
is
only
that
quality
already
mentioned
his
own
astonished
delight
at
the
things
that
he
is
discovering
we
learn
for
instance
about
captain
m
whirr
that
he
wrote
long
letters
home
beginning
always
with
the
words
my
darling
wife
and
relating
in
minute
detail
each
successive
trip
of
the
mrs
m
whirr
we
learn
was
a
pretentious
person
with
a
scraggy
neck
and
a
disdainful
manner
admittedly
and
in
the
neighbourhood
considered
as
quite
the
only
secret
of
her
life
was
her
abject
terror
of
the
time
when
her
husband
would
come
home
to
stay
for
also
in
there
is
the
second
mate
who
never
wrote
any
letters
did
not
seem
to
hope
for
news
from
anywhere
and
though
he
had
been
heard
once
to
mention
west
hartlepool
it
was
with
extreme
bitterness
and
only
in
connection
with
the
extortionate
charges
of
a
how
conscious
we
are
of
jim
s
english
country
parsonage
of
captain
anthony
s
loneliness
of
marlowe
s
isolation
by
this
simple
thread
of
connection
between
the
land
and
the
ship
the
whole
character
stands
human
and
convincing
before
us
of
the
sailors
on
board
the
there
is
not
one
about
whom
after
his
landing
we
are
not
curious
there
is
the
skipper
whose
wife
comes
on
board
a
real
lady
in
a
black
dress
and
with
a
very
soon
the
captain
dressed
very
smartly
and
in
a
white
shirt
went
with
her
over
the
side
we
didn
t
recognise
him
at
all
and
mr
baker
the
chief
mate
is
not
this
little
farewell
enough
to
make
us
his
friends
for
life
no
one
waited
for
him
ashore
mother
died
father
and
two
brothers
yarmouth
fishermen
drowned
together
on
the
dogger
bank
sister
married
and
unfriendly
quite
a
lady
married
to
the
leading
tailor
of
a
little
town
and
its
leading
politician
who
did
not
think
his
sailor
brother
quite
respectable
enough
for
him
quite
a
lady
quite
a
lady
he
thought
sitting
down
for
a
moment
s
rest
on
the
time
enough
to
go
ashore
and
get
a
bite
and
sup
and
a
bed
somewhere
he
didn
t
like
to
part
with
a
ship
no
one
to
think
about
then
the
darkness
of
a
misty
evening
fell
cold
and
damp
upon
the
deserted
deck
and
mr
baker
sat
smoking
thinking
of
all
the
successive
ships
to
whom
through
many
long
years
he
had
given
the
best
of
a
seaman
s
care
and
never
a
command
in
sight
not
once
there
are
others
the
abominable
donkin
for
instance
donkin
entered
they
discussed
the
account
captain
allistoun
said
i
give
you
a
bad
discharge
he
said
quietly
donkin
raised
his
voice
i
don
t
want
your
bloomin
discharge
keep
it
i
m
goin
ter
ave
a
job
he
turned
to
us
no
more
bloomin
sea
for
me
he
said
aloud
all
looked
at
him
he
had
better
clothes
had
an
easy
air
appeared
more
at
home
than
any
of
us
he
stared
with
assurance
enjoying
the
effect
of
his
in
how
many
novels
would
donkin
s
life
have
been
limited
by
the
part
that
he
was
required
to
play
in
the
adventures
of
the
as
it
is
our
interest
in
his
progress
has
been
satisfied
by
a
prologue
only
or
there
is
charley
the
boy
of
the
crew
as
i
came
up
i
saw
a
blowzy
woman
in
a
grey
shawl
and
with
dusty
fluffy
hair
fall
on
charley
s
neck
it
was
his
mother
she
slobbered
over
him
oh
my
boy
my
boy
leggo
me
said
charley
leggo
mother
i
was
passing
him
at
the
time
and
over
the
untidy
head
of
the
blubbering
woman
he
gave
me
a
humorous
smile
and
a
glance
ironic
courageous
and
profound
that
seemed
to
put
all
my
knowledge
of
life
to
shame
i
nodded
and
passed
on
but
heard
him
say
again
if
you
leggo
of
me
this
minyt
ye
shall
ave
a
bob
for
a
drink
out
of
my
but
one
passes
from
these
men
of
the
sea
from
m
whirr
and
baker
from
lingard
and
captain
whalley
from
captain
anthony
and
jim
with
a
suspicion
that
the
author
will
not
convince
us
quite
so
readily
with
his
men
of
the
land
and
that
suspicion
is
never
entirely
dismissed
about
such
men
as
m
whirr
and
baker
he
can
tell
us
nothing
that
we
will
not
believe
he
has
such
sympathy
and
understanding
for
them
that
they
will
we
are
assured
deliver
up
to
him
their
dearest
secrets
those
little
details
m
whirr
s
wife
mr
baker
s
proud
sister
charley
s
mother
are
their
dearest
secrets
but
with
the
citizens
of
the
other
world
with
stein
decoud
gould
verloc
razumov
the
sinister
nikita
the
little
fynes
even
the
great
nostromo
himself
we
can
not
be
so
confident
simply
because
their
discoverer
can
not
yield
them
that
same
perfect
sympathy
his
theory
about
these
men
is
that
they
have
all
of
them
an
that
you
must
search
for
this
patiently
honestly
unsparingly
having
found
it
the
soul
of
the
man
is
revealed
to
you
but
is
it
is
it
not
possible
that
decoud
or
verloc
feeling
the
probing
finger
offer
up
instantly
any
ready
to
hand
because
they
wish
to
be
left
alone
decoud
himself
for
instance
decoud
the
imaginative
journalist
in
speculating
with
his
ironic
mind
upon
romantic
features
at
his
heart
apparently
cynical
and
reserved
the
burning
passion
for
the
beautiful
antonia
he
has
yielded
enough
to
suggest
the
truth
but
the
truth
itself
eludes
us
with
verloc
again
we
have
a
quite
masterly
presentation
of
the
man
as
conrad
sees
him
that
first
description
of
him
is
wonderful
both
in
its
reality
and
its
significance
his
eyes
were
naturally
heavy
he
had
an
air
of
having
wallowed
fully
dressed
all
day
on
an
unmade
with
many
novelists
that
would
be
quite
enough
that
we
should
see
the
character
as
the
author
sees
him
but
because
in
these
histories
we
have
the
convictions
of
the
extension
of
the
protagonists
lives
beyond
the
stated
episodes
it
is
not
enough
because
they
have
lives
independent
of
the
covers
of
the
book
we
feel
that
there
can
be
no
end
to
the
things
that
we
should
be
told
about
them
and
they
must
be
true
things
verloc
for
instance
is
attached
from
the
first
to
his
namely
that
he
should
be
able
to
retain
at
all
costs
his
phlegmatic
state
of
and
should
not
be
jockeyed
out
of
it
at
the
first
sign
of
threatened
change
he
is
terrified
to
his
very
soul
conrad
never
for
an
instant
allows
him
to
leave
this
ground
upon
which
he
has
placed
him
we
see
the
man
tied
to
his
rock
of
an
but
he
has
nevertheless
we
are
assured
another
life
other
motives
other
humours
other
terrors
it
is
perhaps
a
direct
tribute
to
the
authors
reserve
power
that
we
feel
at
the
book
s
close
that
we
should
have
been
told
so
much
more
even
with
the
great
nostromo
himself
we
are
not
satisfied
as
we
are
with
captain
whalley
or
mr
kates
nostromo
is
surely
as
a
picture
the
moat
romantically
satisfying
figure
in
the
english
novel
since
scott
with
the
single
exception
of
thackeray
s
beatrix
and
here
i
am
not
forgetting
captain
silver
david
balfour
catriona
nor
in
our
own
immediate
time
young
beauchamp
or
the
hero
of
that
amazing
and
so
unjustly
obscure
fiction
shadow
of
a
as
a
picture
nostromo
shines
with
a
flaming
colour
shines
as
the
whole
novel
shines
with
a
glow
that
is
flung
by
the
contrasted
balance
of
its
romance
and
realism
from
that
first
vision
of
him
as
he
rides
slowly
through
the
crowds
in
his
magnificent
dress
his
hat
a
gay
sombrero
with
a
silver
cord
and
tassels
the
bright
colours
of
a
mexican
scrape
twisted
on
the
mantle
the
enormous
silver
buttons
on
the
embroidered
leather
jacket
the
row
of
tiny
silver
buttons
down
the
seam
of
the
trousers
the
snowy
linen
a
silk
sash
with
embroidered
ends
the
silver
plates
on
headstall
and
saddle
to
that
last
moment
when
in
the
dimly
lit
room
nostromo
rolled
his
head
slowly
on
the
pillow
and
opened
his
eyes
directing
at
the
weird
figure
perched
by
his
bedside
a
glance
of
enigmatic
and
mocking
scorn
then
his
head
rolled
back
his
eyelids
fell
and
the
capatos
of
the
cargadores
died
without
a
word
or
moan
after
an
hour
of
immobility
broken
by
short
shudders
testifying
to
the
most
atrocious
sufferings
we
are
conscious
of
his
superb
figure
and
after
his
death
we
do
indeed
believe
what
the
last
lines
of
the
book
assure
us
in
that
true
cry
of
love
and
grief
that
seemed
to
ring
aloud
from
punta
mala
to
azuera
and
away
to
the
bright
line
of
the
horizon
overhung
by
a
big
white
cloud
shining
like
a
mass
of
solid
silver
the
genius
of
the
magnificent
capatuz
de
cargadores
dominated
the
dark
gulf
containing
his
conquests
of
treasure
and
his
genius
dominates
yes
but
it
is
the
genius
of
a
magnificent
picture
standing
as
a
frontispiece
to
the
book
of
his
soul
and
that
soul
is
not
given
us
nostromo
proud
to
the
last
refuses
to
surrender
it
to
us
why
is
it
that
the
slender
sketch
of
old
singleton
in
nigger
of
the
gives
us
the
very
heart
of
the
man
so
that
volumes
might
tell
us
more
of
him
indeed
but
could
not
surrender
him
to
us
more
truly
and
all
the
fine
summoning
of
nostromo
only
leaves
him
beyond
our
grasp
we
believe
in
nostromo
but
we
are
told
about
him
we
have
not
met
him
nevertheless
at
another
turn
of
the
road
this
criticism
must
seem
the
basest
ingratitude
when
we
look
back
and
survey
that
crowd
so
various
so
distinct
whether
it
be
they
who
are
busied
before
our
eyes
with
the
daily
life
of
sulaoo
or
the
verloc
family
the
most
poignant
scene
in
the
whole
of
conrad
s
art
the
drive
in
the
cab
of
old
mrs
verloc
winnie
and
stevie
compels
additionally
our
gratitude
or
that
strange
gathering
the
haldins
nikita
laspara
madame
de
s
peter
ivanovitch
raznmov
at
geneva
or
the
highly
coloured
figures
in
a
book
fine
in
some
places
astonishingly
in
others
falk
or
amy
foster
jacobus
and
his
daughter
jasper
and
his
lover
all
those
and
so
many
many
more
what
can
we
do
but
embrace
the
world
that
is
offered
to
us
accept
it
as
an
axiom
of
life
that
of
all
these
figures
some
will
be
near
to
us
some
more
distant
it
is
finally
a
world
that
conrad
offers
us
not
a
series
of
novels
in
whose
pages
we
find
the
same
two
or
three
figures
returning
to
us
old
friends
with
new
faces
and
new
names
but
a
planet
that
we
know
even
as
we
know
the
meredith
planet
the
hardy
planet
the
james
planet
looking
back
we
may
trace
its
towns
and
rivers
its
continents
and
seas
its
mean
streets
and
deep
valleys
its
country
houses
its
sordid
hovels
its
vast
untamed
forests
its
deserts
and
wilderness
although
each
work
from
the
vast
to
the
minutely
perfect
has
its
new
theme
its
form
its
separate
heart
the
swarming
life
that
he
has
created
knows
no
boundary
and
in
this
surely
creation
has
accomplished
its
noblest
work
iii
the
poet
poet
in
conrad
is
lyrical
as
well
as
philosophic
the
lyrical
side
is
absent
in
certain
of
his
works
as
for
example
secret
and
western
or
such
short
stories
as
or
but
the
philosophic
note
sounded
poetically
as
an
instrument
of
music
as
well
as
a
philosophy
is
never
absent
three
elements
in
the
work
of
conrad
the
poet
as
distinct
from
conrad
the
novelist
deserve
consideration
style
atmosphere
and
philosophy
in
the
matter
of
style
the
first
point
that
must
strike
any
constant
reader
of
the
novels
is
the
change
that
is
to
be
marked
between
the
earlier
works
and
the
later
here
is
a
descriptive
passage
from
conrad
s
second
novel
outcast
of
the
he
followed
her
step
by
step
till
at
last
they
both
stopped
facing
each
other
under
the
big
tree
of
the
enclosure
the
solitary
exile
of
the
forests
great
motionless
and
solemn
in
his
abandonment
left
alone
by
the
life
of
ages
that
had
been
pushed
away
from
him
by
those
pigmies
that
crept
at
his
foot
towered
high
and
straight
above
their
leader
he
seemed
to
look
on
dispassionate
and
imposing
in
his
lonely
greatness
spreading
his
branches
wide
in
a
gesture
of
lofty
protection
as
if
to
hide
them
in
the
sombre
shelter
of
innumerable
leaves
as
if
moved
by
the
disdainful
compassion
of
the
strong
by
the
scornful
pity
of
an
aged
giant
to
screen
this
struggle
of
two
human
hearts
from
the
cold
scrutiny
of
glittering
and
from
his
latest
novel
the
very
sea
with
short
flashes
of
foam
bursting
out
here
and
there
in
the
gloomy
distances
the
unchangeable
safe
sea
sheltering
a
man
from
all
passions
except
its
own
anger
seemed
queer
to
the
quick
glance
he
threw
to
windward
when
the
already
effaced
horizon
traced
no
reassuring
limit
to
the
eye
in
the
expiring
diffused
twilight
and
before
the
clouded
night
dropped
its
mysterious
veil
it
was
the
immensity
of
space
made
visible
almost
palpable
young
powell
felt
it
he
felt
it
in
the
sudden
sense
of
his
isolation
the
trustworthy
powerful
ship
of
his
first
acquaintance
reduced
to
a
speck
to
something
almost
undistinguishable
the
mere
support
for
the
soles
of
his
two
feet
before
that
unexpected
old
man
becoming
so
suddenly
articulate
in
a
darkening
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
second
of
these
quotations
is
the
voice
of
marlowe
and
that
therefore
it
should
in
necessity
be
the
simpler
of
the
two
nevertheless
the
distinction
can
very
clearly
be
observed
the
first
piece
of
prose
is
quite
definitely
lyrical
it
has
it
can
not
be
denied
something
of
the
purple
we
feel
that
the
prose
is
too
dependent
upon
sonorous
adjectives
that
it
has
the
deliberation
of
work
slightly
affected
by
the
author
s
determination
that
it
shall
be
fine
the
rhythm
in
it
however
is
as
deliberate
as
the
rhythm
of
any
poem
in
english
the
picture
evoked
as
distinct
and
as
though
it
were
in
actual
tact
a
poem
detached
from
all
context
and
finally
there
is
the
inevitable
philosophical
implication
to
give
the
argument
to
the
picture
such
passages
of
descriptive
prose
may
be
found
again
and
again
in
the
earlier
novels
and
tales
of
conrad
in
s
folly
tales
of
unrest
the
nigger
of
the
narcissus
typhoon
youth
heart
of
darkness
lord
prose
piled
high
with
sonorous
and
adjectives
three
adjectives
to
a
noun
prose
that
sounds
hike
an
eastern
invocation
to
a
deity
in
whom
nevertheless
the
suppliant
does
not
believe
at
its
worst
the
strain
that
its
sonority
places
upon
movements
and
objects
of
no
importance
is
disastrous
for
instance
in
the
tale
called
there
is
the
following
passage
he
saw
her
shoulder
touch
the
lintel
of
the
door
she
swayed
as
if
dazed
there
was
less
than
a
second
of
suspense
while
they
both
felt
as
if
poised
on
the
very
edge
of
moral
annihilation
ready
to
fall
into
some
devouring
nowhere
then
almost
simultaneously
he
shouted
come
back
and
she
let
go
the
handle
of
the
door
she
turned
round
in
peaceful
desperation
like
one
who
has
deliberately
thrown
away
the
last
chance
of
life
and
for
a
moment
the
room
she
faced
appeared
terrible
and
dark
and
safe
like
a
the
situation
here
simply
will
not
bear
the
weight
of
the
words
moral
annihilation
devouring
nowhere
peaceful
desperation
last
chance
of
life
terrible
like
a
that
he
shouted
gives
a
final
touch
of
ludicrous
exaggeration
to
the
whole
passage
often
in
the
earlier
books
conrad
s
style
has
the
awkward
of
a
writer
who
is
still
acquiring
the
language
that
he
is
using
like
a
foreigner
who
shouts
to
us
because
he
thinks
that
thus
we
shall
understand
him
more
easily
but
there
is
also
in
this
earlier
style
the
marked
effect
of
two
influences
one
influence
is
that
of
the
french
language
and
especially
of
the
author
of
when
we
recollect
that
conrad
hesitated
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
as
to
whether
he
would
write
in
french
or
english
we
can
understand
this
french
inflection
flaubert
s
effect
on
his
style
is
quite
unmistakable
this
is
a
sentence
of
flaubert
s
toutes
ses
velléités
de
dénigrement
l
envanouissaiont
sous
la
poésie
du
rôle
qui
l
envahissait
et
entrainée
vers
l
homme
par
l
illusion
du
personnage
elle
tâcha
de
se
figurer
sa
vie
cette
vie
retentissante
extraordinaire
splendide
and
this
a
sentence
of
conrad
s
her
hands
slipped
slowly
off
lingard
s
shoulders
and
her
arms
tell
by
her
side
listless
discouraged
as
if
to
her
to
her
the
savage
violent
and
ignorant
creature
had
been
revealed
clearly
in
that
moment
the
tremendous
fact
of
our
isolation
of
the
loneliness
impenetrable
and
transparent
elusive
and
conrad
s
sentence
reads
like
a
direct
translation
from
the
french
it
is
probable
however
that
his
debt
to
flaubert
and
the
french
language
can
be
very
easily
exaggerated
and
it
does
not
seem
in
any
case
to
have
driven
very
deeply
into
the
heart
of
his
form
the
influence
is
mainly
to
be
detected
in
the
arrangement
of
words
and
sentences
as
though
he
had
in
the
first
years
of
his
work
used
it
as
a
crutch
before
he
could
walk
alone
the
second
of
the
early
influences
upon
his
style
is
of
far
greater
importance
the
influence
of
the
vast
unfettered
elements
of
nature
that
he
had
for
so
many
years
so
directly
served
if
it
were
not
for
his
remarkable
creative
gift
that
had
been
from
the
very
first
at
its
full
strength
his
early
books
would
stand
as
purely
lyrical
evocations
of
the
sea
and
the
forest
it
is
the
poetry
of
the
old
testament
of
which
we
think
in
many
pages
of
s
and
outcast
of
the
a
poetry
that
has
the
rhythm
and
metre
of
a
spontaneous
emotion
he
was
never
again
to
catch
quite
the
spirit
of
that
first
rapture
he
was
under
the
influence
of
these
powers
also
in
that
at
that
time
they
were
too
strong
for
him
we
feel
with
him
that
he
is
impotent
to
express
his
wonder
and
praise
because
he
is
still
so
immediately
under
their
sway
his
style
in
these
earlier
hooks
has
the
repetitions
and
extended
phrases
of
a
man
who
is
marking
time
before
the
inspired
moment
comes
to
him
often
the
inspiration
does
not
come
because
he
can
not
detach
himselt
with
sufficient
pause
and
balance
but
in
his
middle
period
in
the
period
of
typhoon
heart
of
and
this
lyrical
impulse
can
be
seen
at
its
perfection
beating
steadily
spontaneously
with
the
finest
freedom
and
yet
disciplined
as
it
were
by
its
own
will
and
desire
compare
for
a
moment
this
passage
from
with
that
earlier
one
from
outcast
of
the
that
i
quoted
above
he
watched
her
battered
and
solitary
labouring
heavily
in
a
wild
scene
of
mountainous
black
waters
lit
by
the
gleam
of
distant
worlds
she
moved
slowly
breathing
into
the
still
core
of
the
hurricane
the
excess
of
her
strength
in
a
white
cloud
of
steam
and
the
vibration
of
the
escape
was
like
the
defiant
trumpeting
of
a
living
creature
of
the
sea
impatient
for
the
renewal
of
the
contest
it
ceased
suddenly
the
still
air
moaned
above
jakes
head
a
few
stars
shone
into
the
pit
of
black
vapours
the
inky
edge
of
the
frowned
upon
the
ship
under
the
patch
of
glittering
sky
the
stars
too
seemed
to
look
at
her
intently
as
if
for
the
last
time
and
the
cluster
of
their
splendour
sat
like
a
diadem
on
a
lowering
that
is
poet
s
work
and
poet
s
work
at
its
finest
instead
of
impressing
us
as
the
earlier
piece
of
prose
with
the
fact
that
the
author
has
made
the
very
most
of
a
rather
thin
moment
feels
indeed
himself
that
it
is
thin
we
are
here
under
the
influence
of
something
that
can
have
no
limits
to
the
splendours
that
it
contains
the
work
is
thick
as
though
it
had
been
wrought
by
the
finest
workman
out
of
the
heart
of
the
finest
material
and
yet
it
remains
through
all
its
discipline
spontaneous
these
three
tales
and
of
stand
by
themselves
as
the
final
expression
of
conrad
s
lyrical
gift
we
may
remember
such
characters
as
m
whirr
kurtz
marlowe
but
they
are
figures
as
the
old
seneschal
in
eve
of
st
or
the
ancient
mariner
himself
are
figures
they
are
as
surely
complete
poems
wrought
and
finished
in
the
true
spirit
of
poetry
as
whitman
s
lilac
first
on
the
door
yard
or
keats
their
author
was
never
again
to
succeed
so
completely
in
combining
the
free
spirit
of
his
enthusiasm
with
the
disciplined
restraint
of
the
true
artist
the
third
period
of
his
style
shows
him
cool
and
as
to
the
things
that
he
intends
to
do
he
is
now
the
slightly
ironic
artist
whose
business
is
to
get
things
on
to
paper
in
the
clearest
possible
way
he
is
conscious
that
in
the
past
he
has
been
at
the
mercy
of
sonorous
and
adjectives
he
will
use
them
still
but
only
to
show
them
that
they
are
at
his
mercy
marlowe
his
appointed
minister
is
older
he
must
look
back
now
on
the
colours
of
with
an
indulgent
smile
and
when
marlowe
is
absent
in
such
novels
as
secret
and
western
in
such
a
volume
of
stories
as
set
of
the
lyrical
beat
in
the
style
is
utterly
abandoned
we
are
led
forward
by
sentences
as
grave
as
assured
and
sometimes
as
ponderous
as
a
city
policeman
nevertheless
in
that
passage
from
quoted
at
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
although
we
may
be
far
from
the
undisciplined
enthusiasm
of
outcast
of
the
the
lyrical
impulse
still
remains
yes
it
is
there
but
young
powell
felt
in
that
magical
storm
that
was
god
alone
can
share
our
terror
and
demand
our
courage
in
the
later
experience
young
powell
is
our
companion
ii
the
question
of
style
devolves
here
directly
into
the
question
of
atmosphere
there
may
roughly
be
said
to
be
four
classes
of
novelists
in
the
matter
of
atmosphere
there
is
the
novelist
who
intent
upon
his
daily
bread
or
game
of
golf
has
no
desire
to
be
worried
by
such
a
perplexing
business
he
produces
stories
that
might
without
loss
play
the
whole
of
their
action
in
the
of
an
english
railway
station
there
is
the
novelist
who
thinks
that
atmosphere
matters
immensely
who
works
hard
to
produce
it
and
produce
it
in
thick
slabs
there
are
the
novelists
whose
theme
characters
and
background
react
so
admirably
that
the
atmosphere
is
provided
simply
by
that
reaction
and
there
finally
it
is
left
put
into
no
relation
with
other
atmospheres
serving
no
further
purpose
than
the
immediate
one
of
stating
the
facts
of
this
school
are
the
realists
and
in
our
own
day
mr
arnold
bennett
s
brighton
background
in
or
mrs
wharton
s
new
york
background
in
house
of
offer
most
successful
examples
of
such
realistic
work
the
fourth
class
provides
us
with
the
novelists
who
wish
to
place
their
atmosphere
in
relation
with
the
rest
of
life
our
imagination
is
awakened
insensibly
by
the
contemplation
of
some
scene
and
is
thence
extended
to
the
whole
vista
of
life
from
birth
to
death
although
the
scene
may
actually
be
as
remote
or
as
conlined
as
space
can
make
it
its
potential
limits
are
boundless
its
progression
is
extended
beyond
all
possibilities
of
definition
such
a
moment
is
the
death
of
bazarov
in
and
the
searching
of
dmitri
in
brothers
the
scene
at
the
theatre
in
ring
and
the
the
london
meeting
between
beauchamp
and
rené
in
s
it
is
not
only
that
these
scenes
are
done
to
the
full
extent
of
their
doing
it
is
also
that
they
have
behind
them
the
lyrical
impulse
that
ignites
them
with
all
the
emotion
and
beauty
in
the
history
of
the
world
turgeniev
dostoievsky
browning
meredith
were
amongst
the
greatest
of
the
poets
conrad
at
his
highest
moments
is
also
of
that
company
but
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
this
potential
atmosphere
is
simply
lyrical
mr
chesterton
in
his
breathless
age
in
has
named
this
element
glamour
in
writing
of
the
novels
by
george
eliot
he
says
indeed
there
is
almost
every
element
of
literature
except
a
certain
indescribable
thing
called
which
was
the
whole
of
the
brontes
which
we
feel
in
dickens
when
quilp
clambers
and
rotten
wood
by
the
desolate
river
and
even
in
thackeray
when
edmond
wanders
like
some
swarthy
crow
about
the
dismal
avenues
of
now
this
matter
of
is
not
all
because
dickens
for
instance
is
not
at
all
potential
his
pictures
of
quilp
or
the
house
of
the
dedloeks
or
jonas
chuzzlewit
s
escape
after
the
murder
do
not
put
us
into
touch
with
other
worlds
but
we
may
say
at
any
rate
that
when
in
a
novel
atmosphere
potential
it
is
certain
also
to
have
glamour
the
potential
qualities
of
conrad
s
atmosphere
are
amongst
his
very
strongest
gifts
and
it
we
investigate
the
matter
we
see
that
it
is
his
union
of
romance
and
realism
that
gives
such
results
of
almost
no
important
scene
in
his
novels
is
it
possible
to
define
the
boundaries
in
outcast
of
the
when
willems
is
exiled
by
captain
lingard
the
terror
of
that
forest
has
at
its
heart
not
only
the
actual
terror
of
that
immediate
scene
minutely
and
realistically
described
it
has
also
the
terror
of
all
our
knowledge
of
loneliness
desolation
the
power
of
something
stronger
than
ourselves
in
the
contrast
of
jim
with
the
officers
of
the
is
a
contrast
not
only
immediately
vital
and
realised
to
the
very
fringe
of
the
captain
s
gay
and
soiled
pyjamas
but
also
potential
to
the
very
limits
of
our
ultimate
conception
of
the
eternal
contrast
between
good
and
evil
degradation
and
vigour
ugliness
and
beauty
in
nigger
of
the
the
death
of
the
negro
james
wait
immediately
affects
the
lives
of
a
number
of
very
ordinary
human
beings
whose
friends
and
intimates
we
have
become
but
that
shadow
that
traps
the
feet
of
the
negro
that
alarms
the
souls
of
donkin
of
belfast
of
singleton
of
the
boy
charlie
creeps
also
to
our
sides
and
envelops
for
us
far
more
than
that
single
voyage
of
the
when
winnie
verloc
her
old
mother
and
the
boy
stevie
take
their
journey
in
the
cab
it
does
not
seem
ludicrous
to
us
that
the
tears
of
that
large
female
in
a
dark
dusty
wig
and
ancient
silk
dress
festooned
with
dingy
white
cotton
lace
should
move
us
as
though
mrs
verloc
were
our
nearest
friend
that
mournful
but
courageous
journey
remains
in
our
mind
as
an
intimate
companion
of
our
own
mournful
and
courageous
experiences
such
examples
might
be
multiplied
quite
indefinitely
he
has
always
secured
his
atmosphere
by
his
own
eager
curiosity
about
significant
detail
but
his
detail
is
significant
not
because
he
wishes
to
impress
his
reader
with
the
realism
of
his
picture
but
rather
because
he
s
like
a
very
small
boy
in
a
strange
house
pursuing
the
most
romantic
adventures
for
his
own
pleasure
and
excitement
only
we
may
hear
with
many
novelists
the
click
of
satisfaction
with
which
they
drive
another
nail
into
the
framework
that
supports
their
picture
now
see
how
firmly
it
stands
they
say
that
last
nail
settled
but
conrad
is
utterly
unconscious
as
to
his
readers
later
credulity
he
is
too
completely
held
by
his
own
amazing
discoveries
sometimes
as
in
when
no
vision
is
granted
to
him
it
is
as
though
he
were
banging
on
a
brass
tray
with
all
his
strength
so
that
no
one
should
perceive
his
own
grievous
disappointment
at
his
failure
but
in
his
real
discoveries
how
the
atmosphere
piles
itself
up
around
and
about
him
how
we
follow
at
his
heels
penetrating
the
darkness
trusting
to
his
courage
finding
ourselves
suddenly
blinded
by
the
blaze
of
aladdin
s
cave
if
he
is
tracing
the
tragedy
of
willems
and
almayer
a
tragedy
that
has
for
its
natural
background
the
gorgeous
heavy
splendour
of
those
unending
forests
he
sees
details
that
belong
to
the
austerest
and
most
sharply
disciplined
realism
we
see
lakamba
asleep
under
the
moon
slapping
himself
in
his
dreams
to
keep
off
the
mosquitoes
a
bluebottle
comes
buzzing
into
the
verandah
above
the
dirty
plates
of
a
meal
and
defies
lingard
and
almayer
so
that
they
are
like
men
disheartened
by
some
tremendous
failure
the
cards
with
which
lingard
tries
to
build
a
house
for
almayer
s
baby
are
a
dirty
double
pack
with
which
he
used
to
play
chinese
bézique
it
bored
almayer
but
the
old
seaman
delighted
in
it
considering
it
a
remarkable
product
of
chinese
genius
the
atmosphere
of
the
terrible
final
chapters
is
set
against
this
picture
of
a
room
in
which
mrs
willems
is
waiting
for
her
abominable
husband
bits
of
white
stuff
rags
yellow
pink
blue
rags
limp
brilliant
and
soiled
trailed
on
the
floor
lay
on
the
desk
amongst
the
sombre
covers
of
books
soiled
greasy
but
in
virtue
perhaps
of
their
european
origin
the
biggest
set
of
bookshelves
was
partly
hidden
by
a
petticoat
the
waistband
of
which
was
caught
upon
the
back
of
a
slender
book
pulled
a
little
out
of
the
row
so
as
to
make
an
improvised
the
folding
canvas
bedstead
stood
anyhow
parallel
to
no
wall
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
process
of
transportation
to
some
remote
place
dropped
casually
there
by
tired
bearers
and
on
the
tumbled
blankets
that
lay
in
a
disordered
heap
on
its
edge
joanna
sat
through
the
shutter
a
ray
of
sunlight
a
ray
merciless
and
crude
came
into
the
room
beat
in
the
early
morning
upon
the
safe
in
the
corner
then
travelling
against
the
sun
cut
at
midday
the
big
desk
in
two
with
its
solid
and
brilliance
with
its
hot
brilliance
in
which
a
swarm
of
flies
hovered
in
dancing
flight
over
some
dirty
plate
forgotten
there
amongst
yellow
papers
for
many
a
day
and
this
room
is
set
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forests
the
forests
unattainable
enigmatical
for
ever
beyond
reach
like
the
stars
of
heaven
and
as
had
i
space
i
could
multiply
from
every
novel
and
tale
examples
of
this
creation
of
atmosphere
by
the
juxtaposition
of
the
lyrical
and
the
realistic
the
lyrical
pulse
beating
through
realistic
detail
ami
transforming
it
i
will
however
select
one
book
a
supreme
example
of
this
effect
what
i
say
about
may
be
proved
from
any
other
work
of
conrad
s
the
theme
of
is
the
domination
of
the
silver
of
the
sulaco
mine
over
the
bodies
and
souls
of
the
human
beings
who
live
near
it
the
light
of
the
silver
shines
over
the
book
it
is
typified
by
the
white
head
of
iliguerota
rising
majestically
upon
the
conrad
then
in
choosing
his
theme
has
selected
the
most
romantic
possible
the
spirit
of
silver
treasure
luring
men
on
desperately
to
adventure
and
to
death
his
atmosphere
therefore
is
in
its
highest
lights
romantic
even
until
that
last
vision
of
all
of
the
bright
line
of
the
horizon
overhung
by
a
big
white
cloud
shining
like
a
mass
of
solid
sulaco
burns
with
colour
we
can
see
as
though
we
had
been
there
yesterday
those
streets
with
the
coaches
great
family
arks
swayed
on
high
leathern
springs
full
of
pretty
powdered
faces
in
which
the
eyes
looked
intensely
alive
and
black
the
houses
in
the
early
sunshine
delicate
primrose
pale
pink
pale
blue
or
after
dark
from
mrs
gould
s
balcony
towards
the
plaza
end
of
the
street
the
glowing
coals
in
the
hazeros
of
the
market
women
cooking
their
evening
meal
glowed
red
along
the
edge
of
the
pavement
a
man
appeared
without
a
sound
in
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
showing
the
coloured
inverted
triangle
of
his
broidered
poncho
square
on
his
shoulders
hanging
to
a
point
below
his
knees
from
the
harbour
end
of
the
calle
a
horseman
walked
his
mount
gleaming
abreast
each
lamp
under
the
dark
shape
of
the
later
there
is
that
sinister
glimpse
of
the
plaza
where
a
patrol
of
cavalry
rode
round
and
round
without
penetrating
into
the
streets
which
resounded
with
shouts
and
the
strumming
of
guitars
issuing
from
the
open
doors
of
pulperias
and
above
the
roofs
next
to
the
perpendicular
lines
of
the
cathedral
towers
the
snowy
curve
of
higuerota
blocked
a
large
space
of
darkening
blue
sky
before
the
windows
of
the
in
its
final
created
beauty
sulaco
is
as
romantic
as
coloured
as
one
of
those
towns
under
whose
gates
we
watch
grimm
s
princes
and
princesses
passing
but
the
detail
of
it
is
built
with
careful
realism
demanded
by
the
architecture
of
manchester
or
we
wonder
as
sulaco
grows
familiar
to
us
as
we
realise
its
cathedral
its
squares
and
streets
and
houses
its
slums
its
wharves
its
sea
its
hills
and
forests
why
it
is
that
other
novelists
have
not
created
towns
for
us
anthony
trollope
did
indeed
give
us
barchester
but
barchester
is
a
shadow
beside
sulaco
mr
thomas
hardy
s
wessex
map
is
the
most
fascinating
document
in
modern
fiction
with
the
possible
exception
of
stevenson
s
chart
in
conrad
without
any
map
at
all
gives
us
a
familiarity
with
a
small
town
on
the
south
american
coast
that
far
excels
our
knowledge
of
barsetshire
wessex
and
john
silver
s
treasure
if
any
attentive
reader
of
were
put
down
in
sulaco
tomorrow
he
would
feel
as
though
he
had
returned
to
his
native
town
the
detail
that
provides
this
final
picture
is
throughout
the
book
incessant
but
never
intruding
we
do
not
look
back
when
the
novel
is
finished
to
any
especial
moment
of
explanation
or
introduction
we
have
been
led
quite
unconsciously
forward
we
are
led
at
moments
of
the
deepest
drama
through
rooms
and
passages
that
are
only
remembered
many
hours
later
in
retrospect
there
is
for
instance
the
aristocratic
club
that
extended
to
strangers
the
large
hospitality
of
the
cool
big
rooms
of
its
historic
quarters
in
the
front
part
of
a
house
once
a
residence
of
a
high
official
of
the
holy
office
the
two
wings
shut
up
crumbled
behind
the
nailed
doors
and
what
may
be
described
as
a
grove
of
young
grown
in
the
unpaved
patio
concealed
the
utter
ruin
of
the
back
part
facing
the
gate
you
turned
in
from
the
street
as
if
entering
a
secluded
orchard
where
you
came
upon
the
foot
of
a
disjointed
staircase
guarded
by
a
effigy
of
some
saintly
bishop
mitred
and
stalled
and
bearing
the
indignity
of
a
broken
nose
meekly
with
his
fine
stone
hands
crossed
on
his
breast
the
faces
of
servants
with
mops
of
black
hair
peeped
at
you
from
above
the
click
of
billiard
balls
came
to
your
ears
and
ascending
the
steps
you
would
perhaps
see
in
the
first
steps
very
stiff
upon
a
chair
in
a
good
light
don
pépé
moving
his
long
moustaches
as
he
spelt
his
way
at
arm
s
length
through
an
old
sta
marta
newspaper
his
horse
a
but
persevering
black
brute
with
a
hammer
bead
you
would
have
seen
in
the
street
dozing
motionless
under
an
immense
saddle
with
its
nose
almost
touching
the
curbstone
of
the
how
perfectly
recollected
is
that
passage
can
we
not
hear
the
exclamation
of
some
reader
yes
those
it
was
just
like
that
when
i
was
there
how
convinced
we
are
of
conrad
s
unimpeachable
veracity
how
like
him
are
those
remembered
details
the
nailed
doors
the
fine
stone
hands
at
arm
and
can
we
not
sniff
something
of
the
author
s
impatience
to
let
himself
go
and
tell
us
more
about
that
horse
of
whose
adventures
with
don
pépé
he
must
remember
enough
to
fill
a
volume
he
is
able
therefore
upon
this
foundation
of
a
minute
and
scrupulous
réalisai
to
build
as
fantastic
a
building
as
he
pleases
without
fear
of
denying
truth
he
does
not
in
at
any
rate
choose
to
be
fantastic
but
he
is
romantic
and
our
final
impression
of
the
silver
mine
and
the
town
under
its
white
shining
shadow
is
of
something
both
as
real
and
as
beautiful
as
any
vision
of
keats
or
shelley
but
with
the
colour
we
remember
also
the
grim
tragedy
of
the
life
that
has
been
shown
to
us
near
to
the
cathedral
and
the
little
tinkering
streets
of
the
guitars
were
the
last
awful
struggles
of
the
unhappy
hirsch
we
remember
nostromo
riding
with
his
silver
buttons
catching
the
red
flower
flung
to
him
out
of
the
crowd
but
we
remember
also
his
death
and
the
agony
of
his
defeated
pride
sotillo
the
vainest
and
most
sordid
of
bandits
is
no
figure
for
a
fairy
story
here
then
is
the
secret
of
conrad
s
atmosphere
he
is
the
poet
working
through
realism
to
the
poetic
vision
of
life
that
intention
is
at
the
heart
of
his
work
from
the
first
line
of
s
to
the
last
line
of
is
not
simply
the
history
of
certain
lives
that
were
concerned
in
a
south
american
revolution
it
that
history
but
it
is
also
a
vision
a
statement
of
beauty
that
has
no
country
nor
period
and
sets
no
barrier
of
immediate
history
or
fable
for
its
interpretation
when
however
we
come
finally
to
the
philosophy
that
lies
behind
this
creation
of
character
and
atmosphere
we
perceive
beyond
question
certain
limitations
iii
as
we
have
already
seen
conrad
is
of
the
firm
and
resolute
conviction
that
life
is
too
strong
too
clever
and
too
remorseless
for
the
sons
of
men
it
is
as
though
from
some
high
window
looking
down
he
were
able
to
watch
some
shore
from
whose
security
men
were
for
ever
launching
little
boats
upon
a
limitless
and
angry
sea
he
observes
them
as
they
advance
with
confidence
with
determination
each
with
his
own
sure
ambition
of
nailing
victory
to
his
mast
he
alone
can
see
that
the
horizon
is
limitless
he
can
see
farther
than
they
from
his
height
he
can
follow
their
fortunes
their
brave
struggles
their
fortitude
to
the
very
last
he
admires
that
courage
the
simplicity
of
that
faith
but
his
irony
springs
from
his
knowledge
of
the
inevitable
end
there
are
we
may
thankfully
maintain
other
possible
views
of
life
and
it
is
surely
conrad
s
harshest
limitation
that
he
should
never
be
free
from
this
certain
obsession
of
the
vanity
of
human
struggle
so
bound
is
he
by
this
that
he
is
driven
to
choose
characters
who
will
prove
his
faith
we
can
remember
many
fine
and
courageous
characters
of
his
creation
we
can
remember
no
single
one
who
is
not
foredoomed
to
defeat
jim
wins
indeed
his
victory
but
at
the
close
and
that
s
the
end
he
passes
away
under
a
cloud
inscrutable
at
heart
forgotten
unforgiven
and
excessively
romantic
he
goes
away
from
a
living
woman
to
celebrate
his
pitiless
wedding
with
a
shadowy
ideal
of
conrad
s
ironical
smile
that
has
watched
with
tenderness
the
history
of
jim
s
endeavours
proclaims
at
the
last
that
that
pursuit
has
been
vain
as
vain
as
stein
s
butterflies
and
for
the
rest
as
mr
curle
in
his
study
of
conrad
has
admirably
observed
every
character
is
faced
with
the
enemy
for
whom
he
is
by
character
least
fitted
nostromo
whose
heart
s
desire
it
is
that
his
merits
should
be
acclaimed
before
men
is
devoured
by
the
one
dragon
to
whom
human
achievements
are
nothing
lust
of
treasure
m
whirr
the
most
unimaginative
of
men
is
opposed
by
the
most
tremendous
of
god
s
splendid
terrors
and
although
he
saves
his
ship
from
the
storm
so
blind
is
he
to
the
meaning
of
the
things
that
he
has
witnessed
that
he
might
as
well
have
never
been
born
captain
brierley
watching
the
degradation
of
a
from
a
security
that
nothing
it
seems
can
threaten
is
himself
caught
by
that
very
degradation
the
beast
in
the
jungle
is
waiting
ever
ready
to
leap
the
victim
is
always
in
his
power
it
comes
from
this
philosophy
of
life
that
the
qualities
in
the
human
soul
that
conrad
most
definitely
admires
are
blind
courage
and
obedience
to
duty
his
men
of
brain
marlowe
decoud
stein
are
melancholy
and
ironic
if
you
see
far
enough
you
must
see
how
hopeless
the
struggle
the
only
way
to
be
honestly
happy
is
to
have
no
imagination
and
because
conrad
is
tender
at
heart
and
would
have
his
characters
happy
if
possible
he
chooses
men
without
imagination
those
are
the
men
of
the
sea
whom
he
has
known
and
loved
the
men
of
the
land
see
farther
than
the
men
of
the
sea
and
must
therefore
be
either
fools
or
knaves
towards
captain
anthony
towards
captain
lingard
he
extends
his
love
and
pity
for
verloc
for
ossipon
for
old
de
barral
he
has
a
disgust
that
is
beyond
words
for
the
fynes
and
their
brethren
he
has
contempt
for
two
women
of
the
land
winnie
verloc
and
mrs
gould
he
reserves
his
love
and
for
them
alone
but
they
have
in
their
hearts
the
simplicity
the
honesty
of
his
own
sea
captains
this
then
is
quite
simply
his
philosophy
it
has
no
variation
or
relief
he
will
not
permit
his
characters
to
escape
he
will
not
himself
try
to
draw
the
soul
of
a
man
who
is
stronger
than
fate
his
ironic
melancholy
does
not
tor
an
instant
hamper
his
interest
that
is
as
keen
and
acute
as
is
the
absorption
of
any
collector
of
specimens
but
at
the
end
of
it
all
as
with
his
own
stein
he
says
of
him
that
he
is
preparing
to
leave
all
this
preparing
to
leave
while
he
waves
his
hand
sadly
at
his
utterly
opposed
is
it
from
the
philosophy
of
the
one
english
writer
whom
in
all
other
ways
conrad
most
obviously
resembles
robert
browning
as
philosophers
they
have
no
possible
ground
of
communication
save
in
the
honesty
that
is
common
to
both
of
them
as
artists
both
in
their
subjects
and
their
treatment
of
their
subjects
they
are
in
many
ways
of
an
amazing
resemblance
although
the
thorough
investigation
of
that
resemblance
would
need
far
more
space
than
i
can
give
it
here
browning
s
interest
in
life
was
derived
on
the
novelist
s
side
of
him
from
his
absorption
in
the
affairs
spiritual
and
physical
of
men
and
women
on
the
poet
s
side
in
the
question
again
spiritual
and
physical
that
arose
from
those
affairs
conrad
has
not
browning
s
realisation
of
the
necessity
of
discovering
the
individual
philosophy
that
belongs
to
every
individual
case
he
is
too
immediately
enveloped
in
his
one
overwhelming
melancholy
analysis
but
he
has
exactly
that
eager
passionate
pursuit
of
romance
a
romance
to
be
seized
only
through
the
most
accurate
and
honest
realism
browning
s
realism
was
born
of
his
excitement
at
the
number
and
interest
of
his
discoveries
he
chose
for
instance
in
the
most
romantic
of
subjects
and
having
made
his
choice
found
that
there
was
such
a
world
of
realistic
detail
in
the
case
that
in
his
excitement
he
forgot
that
the
rest
of
the
world
did
not
know
quite
as
much
as
he
did
is
not
this
exactly
what
we
may
say
of
mr
chesterton
has
written
of
browning
he
substituted
the
street
with
the
green
blind
for
the
faded
garden
of
watteau
and
the
blue
spirt
of
a
lighted
match
for
the
monotony
of
the
evening
conrad
has
substituted
for
the
lover
serenading
his
mistress
window
the
passion
of
a
faded
woman
for
her
idiot
boy
or
the
elopement
of
the
daughter
of
a
fraudulent
speculator
with
an
elderly
taciturn
sea
captain
the
characters
upon
whom
robert
browning
lavished
his
affection
are
precisely
conrad
s
characters
is
not
waring
conrad
s
man
and
for
the
rest
is
not
mr
sludge
own
brother
to
verloc
and
old
de
barrel
bishop
blougram
first
cousin
to
the
great
personage
in
secret
captain
anthony
brother
to
caponsacchi
mrs
gould
sister
to
pompilia
it
is
not
only
that
browning
and
conrad
both
investigate
these
characters
with
the
same
determination
to
extract
the
last
word
of
truth
from
the
matter
not
grimly
but
with
a
thrilling
beat
of
the
heart
it
is
also
that
the
worlds
of
these
two
poets
are
the
same
how
deeply
would
nostromo
decoud
gould
monyngham
the
verlocs
flora
de
barrel
m
whirr
jim
have
interested
browning
surely
conrad
has
witnessed
the
revelation
of
caliban
of
childe
roland
of
james
lee
s
wife
of
the
figures
in
the
arezzo
tragedy
even
of
that
bishop
who
ordered
his
tomb
at
st
praxed
s
church
with
a
strange
wonder
as
though
he
himself
had
assisted
at
these
discoveries
finally
ring
and
the
with
its
multiplied
witnesses
its
statement
as
a
case
of
life
its
pursuit
of
beauty
through
truth
the
simplicity
of
the
characters
of
pompilia
caponsacchi
and
the
pope
the
last
frantic
appeal
of
guido
the
detail
encrusted
thick
in
the
walls
of
that
superb
building
here
we
can
see
the
highest
pinnacle
of
that
temple
that
has
lord
jim
amongst
its
other
turrets
buttresses
and
towers
conrad
is
his
own
master
he
has
imitated
no
one
he
has
created
as
i
have
already
said
his
own
planet
but
the
heights
to
which
browning
carried
showed
the
author
of
s
the
signs
of
the
road
that
he
was
to
follow
if
as
has
often
been
said
browning
was
as
truly
novelist
as
poet
may
we
not
now
say
with
equal
justice
that
conrad
is
as
truly
poet
as
novelist
iv
romance
and
realism
i
terms
romance
and
realism
have
been
used
of
late
years
very
largely
as
a
means
of
escape
from
this
business
of
the
creation
of
character
the
purely
romantic
novel
may
now
be
said
to
be
in
england
at
any
rate
absolutely
dead
mr
frank
swinnerton
in
his
study
of
louis
said
stevenson
reviving
the
romance
of
england
created
a
school
which
has
brought
romance
to
be
the
sweepings
of
an
old
if
romance
is
to
be
conventional
in
a
double
sense
if
it
spring
not
from
a
personal
vision
of
life
but
is
only
a
tedious
virtuosity
a
pretence
a
conscious
toy
romance
as
an
art
is
dead
the
art
was
jaded
when
reade
finished
his
vocifer
ous
but
it
was
not
dead
and
if
it
is
dead
stevenson
killed
it
we
may
differ
very
considerably
from
mr
swinnerton
with
regard
to
his
estimate
of
stevenson
s
present
and
future
literary
value
without
denying
that
the
date
of
the
publication
of
was
also
the
date
of
the
death
of
the
purely
romantic
novel
but
surely
here
as
mr
swinnerton
himself
infers
the
term
romantic
is
used
in
the
limited
and
truncated
idea
that
has
formed
lately
the
popular
idea
of
romance
in
exactly
the
same
way
the
term
realism
has
recently
been
most
foolishly
and
uncritically
handicapped
romance
in
its
modern
use
covers
everything
that
is
removed
from
reality
i
like
romances
we
hear
the
modern
reader
say
because
they
take
me
away
from
real
life
which
i
desire
to
in
the
same
way
realism
is
defined
by
its
enemies
as
a
photographic
enumeration
of
unimportant
facts
by
an
observant
pessimist
i
like
realism
admirers
of
a
certain
order
of
novel
exclaim
because
it
is
so
like
life
it
tells
me
just
what
i
myself
see
every
day
i
know
where
i
nevertheless
impatient
though
we
may
be
of
these
utterly
false
ideas
of
romance
and
realism
a
definition
of
those
terms
that
will
satisfy
everyone
is
almost
impossible
i
can
not
hope
to
achieve
so
exclusive
an
ambition
i
can
only
say
that
to
myself
realism
is
the
study
of
life
with
all
the
rational
faculties
of
observation
reason
and
reminiscence
romance
is
the
study
of
life
with
the
faculties
of
imagination
i
do
not
mean
that
realism
may
not
be
emotional
poetic
even
lyrical
but
it
is
based
always
upon
truth
perceived
and
recorded
is
the
essence
ol
observation
in
the
same
way
romance
may
be
indeed
must
be
accurate
and
defined
in
its
own
world
but
its
spirit
is
the
spirit
of
imagination
working
often
upon
observation
and
sometimes
simply
upon
inspiration
it
is
at
any
rate
understood
here
that
the
word
romance
does
not
for
a
moment
imply
a
necessary
divorce
from
reality
nor
does
realism
imply
a
detailed
and
dusty
preference
for
morbid
and
unagreeable
subjects
it
is
possible
for
romance
to
be
as
honestly
and
clearly
perceptive
as
realism
but
it
is
not
so
easy
for
it
to
be
so
because
imagination
is
more
difficult
of
discipline
than
observation
it
is
possible
for
realism
to
be
as
eloquent
and
potential
as
romance
although
it
can
not
so
easily
achieve
eloquence
because
of
its
fear
of
deserting
truth
moreover
with
regard
to
the
influence
of
foreign
literature
upon
the
english
novel
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
influence
of
the
french
novel
which
was
at
its
strongest
between
the
years
of
and
was
towards
realism
and
that
the
influence
of
the
russian
novel
which
has
certainly
been
very
strongly
marked
in
england
during
the
last
years
is
all
towards
if
we
wished
to
know
exactly
what
is
meant
by
such
a
novel
as
brothers
such
a
play
as
cherry
are
there
before
us
as
the
best
possible
examples
we
might
say
in
a
word
that
has
in
the
england
of
taken
the
place
that
was
occupied
in
by
ii
it
is
joseph
conrad
whose
influence
is
chiefly
responsible
for
this
development
in
the
english
novel
just
as
in
the
early
nineties
mr
henry
james
and
mr
rudyard
kipling
the
one
potential
the
other
kinetic
influenced
beyond
all
contemporary
novelists
the
minds
of
their
younger
generation
so
years
later
do
mr
joseph
conrad
and
mr
wells
the
one
potential
the
other
kinetic
hold
that
same
position
joseph
conrad
from
the
very
first
influenced
though
he
was
by
the
french
novel
showed
that
realism
alone
was
not
enough
for
him
that
is
to
say
that
in
presenting
the
case
of
almayer
it
was
not
enough
for
him
merely
to
state
as
truthfully
as
possible
the
facts
those
facts
sordid
as
they
are
make
the
story
of
almayer
s
degradation
sufficiently
realistic
when
it
is
merely
recorded
and
perceived
by
any
observer
but
upon
these
recorded
facts
conrad
s
imagination
without
for
a
moment
deserting
the
truth
worked
beautifying
ennobling
it
giving
it
pity
and
terror
above
all
putting
it
mto
relation
with
the
whole
universe
the
whole
history
of
the
cycle
of
life
and
death
as
i
have
said
the
romantic
novel
in
its
simplest
form
was
used
very
often
by
writers
who
wished
to
escape
from
the
business
of
the
creation
of
character
it
had
not
been
used
for
that
purpose
by
sir
walter
scott
who
was
indeed
the
first
english
but
it
was
so
used
by
his
successors
who
found
a
little
optimism
a
little
adventure
a
little
colour
and
a
little
tradition
go
a
long
way
towards
covering
the
required
ground
conrad
had
from
the
first
a
poet
s
that
is
to
say
a
romantic
mind
and
his
determination
to
use
that
romance
realistically
was
simply
his
determination
to
justify
the
full
play
of
his
romantic
mind
in
the
eyes
of
all
honest
men
in
that
intention
he
has
absolutely
succeeded
he
has
not
abated
one
jot
of
his
romance
lord
jim
heart
of
are
amongst
the
most
romantic
things
in
all
our
literature
but
the
last
charge
that
any
critic
can
make
against
him
is
falsification
whether
of
facts
of
inference
or
of
consequences
the
whole
history
of
his
development
has
for
its
this
determination
to
save
his
romance
by
his
reality
to
extend
his
reality
by
his
romance
he
found
in
english
fiction
little
that
could
assist
him
in
this
development
the
russian
novelists
were
to
supply
him
with
his
clue
this
whole
question
of
russian
influence
is
difficult
to
define
but
that
conrad
has
been
influenced
by
turgéniev
a
little
and
by
dostoievsky
very
considerably
can
not
be
denied
and
punishment
the
idiot
the
possessed
the
brothers
are
romantic
realism
at
the
most
astonishing
heights
that
this
development
of
the
novel
is
ever
likely
to
attain
we
will
never
see
again
heroes
of
the
prince
myshkin
dmitri
karamazov
nicolas
stavrogin
build
men
so
real
to
us
that
no
change
of
time
or
place
age
or
sickness
can
take
them
from
us
men
so
beautifully
lit
with
the
romantic
passion
of
dostoievsky
s
love
of
humanity
that
they
seem
to
warm
the
whole
world
as
we
know
it
with
the
fire
of
their
charity
that
power
of
creating
figures
typical
as
well
as
individual
has
been
denied
to
conrad
captain
anthony
nostromo
jim
do
not
belong
to
the
whole
world
nor
do
they
escape
the
limitations
and
confinements
that
their
presentation
as
cases
involves
on
them
moreover
conrad
does
not
love
humanity
he
feels
pity
tenderness
admiration
but
love
except
for
certain
of
his
sea
heroes
never
and
even
with
his
sea
heroes
it
is
love
built
on
his
scorn
of
the
land
dostoievsky
scorned
no
one
and
nothing
as
relentless
in
his
pursuit
of
the
truth
as
stendhal
or
flaubert
he
found
humanity
as
he
investigated
it
beautiful
because
of
its
humanity
conrad
finds
humanity
pitiable
because
of
its
humanity
nevertheless
he
has
been
influenced
by
the
russian
writer
continuously
and
sometimes
obviously
in
at
least
one
novel
western
the
influence
has
led
to
imitation
for
that
reason
perhaps
that
novel
is
the
least
vital
of
all
his
books
and
we
feel
as
though
dostoievsky
had
given
him
razumov
to
see
what
he
could
make
of
him
and
had
remained
too
overwhelmingly
curious
an
onlooker
to
allow
independent
creation
what
however
conrad
has
in
common
with
the
creator
of
raskolnikov
is
his
thrilling
pursuit
of
the
lives
the
hearts
the
minutest
details
of
his
characters
conrad
alone
of
all
english
novelists
shares
this
zest
with
the
great
russian
dostoievsky
found
his
romance
in
his
love
of
his
conrad
finds
his
in
his
love
of
beauty
his
poet
s
cry
for
colour
but
their
realism
they
find
together
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
they
find
it
not
as
flaubert
that
they
make
of
it
a
perfect
work
of
art
not
as
turgéniev
that
they
may
extract
from
it
a
flower
of
poignant
beauty
not
as
tolstoi
that
they
may
from
it
found
a
gospel
simply
they
pursue
their
quest
because
the
breathless
interest
of
the
pursuit
is
stronger
than
they
they
have
both
of
them
created
characters
simply
because
characters
demanded
to
be
created
we
feel
that
emma
bovary
was
dragged
painfully
arduously
against
all
the
strength
of
her
determination
out
of
the
shades
where
she
was
lurking
myshkin
the
karamazovs
and
in
their
own
degree
nostromo
almayer
m
whirr
demanded
that
they
should
be
flung
upon
the
page
instead
of
seizing
upon
romance
as
a
means
of
avoiding
character
he
has
triumphantly
forced
it
to
aid
him
in
the
creation
of
the
lives
that
through
him
demand
existence
this
may
be
said
to
be
the
great
thing
that
conrad
has
done
for
the
english
novel
he
has
brought
the
zest
of
creation
back
into
it
the
french
novelists
used
life
to
perfect
their
art
the
russian
novelists
used
art
to
liberate
their
passion
for
life
that
at
this
moment
in
russia
the
novel
has
lost
that
zest
that
the
work
of
kouprin
artzybashev
sologub
merejkovsky
andreiev
shows
exhaustion
and
sterility
means
nothing
the
stream
will
soon
ran
full
again
meanwhile
we
in
england
know
once
more
what
it
is
to
feel
in
the
novel
the
power
behind
the
novelist
to
be
ourselves
in
the
grip
of
a
force
that
is
not
afraid
of
romance
nor
ashamed
of
realism
that
cares
for
life
as
life
and
not
as
a
means
of
proving
the
necessity
for
form
the
danger
of
too
many
adjectives
the
virtues
of
the
divorce
laws
or
the
paradise
of
free
love
iii
finally
what
will
be
the
effect
of
the
work
of
joseph
conrad
upon
the
english
novel
of
the
future
does
this
that
he
has
provided
for
us
show
any
signs
of
influencing
that
future
i
think
that
it
does
in
the
work
of
all
of
the
more
interesting
younger
english
novelists
in
the
work
of
mr
forster
mr
lawrence
mr
beresford
mr
george
mr
frank
swinnerton
air
gilbert
gannan
miss
viola
meynell
mr
brett
young
this
influence
is
to
be
detected
even
with
such
avowed
realists
as
mr
beresford
mr
george
and
mr
swinnerton
the
realism
is
of
a
nature
very
different
from
the
realism
of
even
ten
years
ago
as
can
be
seen
at
once
by
comparing
so
recent
a
novel
as
mr
swinnerton
s
the
with
mr
arnold
bennett
s
and
profane
or
mr
galsworthy
s
of
and
mr
forster
is
a
of
most
curious
originality
whose
and
s
may
possibly
provide
the
historian
of
english
literature
with
dates
as
important
as
the
publication
of
s
in
the
answer
to
this
question
does
not
properly
belong
to
this
essay
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
neither
the
old
romance
nor
the
old
realism
can
return
we
have
been
shown
in
something
that
has
the
colour
of
and
the
reality
of
grub
if
on
the
one
hand
the
pessimists
lament
that
the
english
novel
is
dead
that
everything
that
can
be
done
has
been
done
there
is
surely
on
the
other
hand
some
justification
for
the
optimists
who
believe
that
at
few
periods
in
english
literature
has
the
novel
shown
more
signs
of
a
thrilling
and
original
future
for
signs
of
the
possible
development
of
conrad
himselt
one
may
glance
for
a
moment
at
his
last
novel
the
conclusion
of
and
the
last
volume
of
short
stories
had
shown
that
there
was
some
danger
lest
romance
should
divorce
him
ultimately
from
reality
splendid
tale
though
it
is
does
not
entirely
reassure
us
the
theme
of
the
book
is
the
pursuit
of
almost
helpless
uprightness
and
innocence
by
almost
helpless
evil
and
malignancy
that
is
to
say
that
the
strength
and
virtue
of
heyst
and
lena
are
as
elemental
and
independent
of
human
will
and
effort
as
the
villainy
and
slime
of
mr
jones
and
ricardo
conrad
has
here
then
returned
to
his
old
early
demonstration
that
nature
is
too
strong
for
man
and
i
feel
as
though
in
this
book
he
had
intended
the
whole
affair
to
be
blown
finally
by
some
natural
volcanic
eruption
he
prepares
for
that
eruption
and
when
for
some
reason
or
another
that
elemental
catastrophe
is
pre
vented
he
consoles
himself
by
strewing
the
beach
of
his
island
with
the
battered
corpses
of
his
characters
it
is
in
such
a
wanton
conclusion
following
as
it
does
immediately
upon
the
finest
strongest
and
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
whole
of
conrad
the
last
conversation
between
heyst
and
lena
that
we
see
this
divorce
from
reality
we
see
it
again
in
the
more
fantastic
characteristics
of
mr
jones
and
ricardo
in
the
presence
of
the
orang
outang
and
in
other
smaller
and
less
important
effects
at
the
same
time
his
realism
when
he
pleases
as
in
the
arrival
of
the
boat
of
the
thirst
maddened
trio
on
the
island
beach
is
as
magnificent
in
its
austerity
and
truth
as
ever
it
was
will
he
allow
his
imagination
to
carry
him
wildly
into
fantasy
and
incredibility
he
has
not
during
these
last
years
exerted
the
discipline
and
restraint
that
were
once
his
law
nevertheless
at
the
last
when
one
looks
back
over
twenty
years
from
the
s
of
to
the
of
one
realises
that
it
was
for
the
english
novel
no
mean
nor
insignificant
fortune
that
brought
the
author
of
those
books
to
our
shores
to
give
a
fresh
impetus
to

progress
of
our
