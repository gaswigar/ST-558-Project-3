a

setting
down

with

slam
and

came
steaming
into

the
drag
of
its

another
item

a

seeking
vainly
for

upset
a
stack
of

with
a
crash
while
above
all
the
din
and
turmoil
rose
the
strident
rasping
voice
of
a
boy
crying
his
selection
of

with
zeal
from

and
the

of

hats
already
collected
on

ecstatic
greetings
were
exchanged
urgent
questions
asked
and
hasty
answers
given
and

poured
forth
with
the

volubility

which

tongue
is
capable
urged
by
brief
directions
from

surged
towards

were

grinning
porter
slammed
the
doors
the
green
flag
waved
and
the
local
train
long
overdue
started
with
a
jerk
for
the
craigwen
valley
past
the
grey
old
castle
that
looked
seawards
over
the
estuary
past
the
little
white
town
of
llangarmon
with
its
ancient
walls
and
fortified
gates
past
the
quay
where
the
fishing
smacks
were
lying
idly
at
anchor
and
a
was
unloading
its
human
cargo
past
the
long
stretch
of
sandy
common
where
the
white
tents
of
the
territorials
evoked
an
outcry
of
interest
then
up
alongside
the
broad
tidal
river
towards
where
the
mountains
faint
and
misty
rose
shouldering
one
another
till
they
merged
into
the
white
nebulous
region
of
the
sky
those
lucky
ones
who
had
secured
window
seats
on
the
river
side
of
the
carriage
were
loud
in
their
acclamations
of
satisfaction
as
familiar
objects
in
the
landscape
came
into
sight

wish
they
could

been
talking
already
you
never
stopped
in
fact
remarked
beth
broadway
proffering
a
swiftly
disappearing
packet
of
pear
drops
with
a
generosity
born
of
the
knowledge
that
all
sweets
would
be
confiscated
on
arrival
at
the
woodlands
i
know
i
have
but
that
was
merely
by
the
way
it
was
anything
very
particular
and
i
got
something
i
want
to
tell
you
something
fearfully
important
absolutely
super
know
she
actually
coming
to
school
is
it
great
she
to
be
my
i
just
wild
to
see
her

by
the
muses
whom
are
you
talking
about
means
the
cat
sniggered
gertrude
oliver
why
ca
you
guess
what
stupids
you
are
it
rona
of
course
rona
mitchell
from
new
zealand
you
ragging
it
a
fact
it
is
indeed
the
incredulity
on
the
countenances
of
her
companions
having
yielded
to
an
expression
of
interest
ulyth
continued
her
information
with
increased
zest
and
a
conscious
though
nonchalant
air
of
importance
her
father
wants
her
to
go
to
school
in
england
so
he
decided
to
send
her
to
the
woodlands
so
that
she
might
be
with
me
do
you
mean
that
girl
you
were
so
very
proud
of
corresponding
with
i
forget
how
the
whole
business
began
broke
in
stephanie
radford
do
you
remember
it
was
through
a
magazine
we
take
the
editor
arranged
for
readers
of
the
magazine
in
england
to
exchange
letters
with
other
readers
overseas
he
gave
me
rona
we
been
writing
to
each
other
every
month
for
two
years
i
had
an
australian
but
she
would
write
regularly
so
we
dropped
it
volunteered
beth
broadway
i
believe
gertrude
had
somebody
too
yes
a
girl
in
canada
i
never
got
farther
than
one
short
letter
and
a
picture
post
card
though
i
do
so
loathe
writing
sighed
gertrude
ulyth
the
only
one
who
kept
the
thing
up
and
do
you
mean
to
say
this
new
zealander
actually
coming
to
our
school
asked
stephanie
that
the
joysome
gist
of
my
remarks
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
pining
and
yearning
to
see
her
she
seems
like
a
girl
out
of
a
story
to
think
of
it
rona
mitchell
at
school
with
us
suppose
you
do
like
her
oh
i
certain
i
shall
she
written
me
the
jolliest
loveliest
funniest
letters
i
feel
i
know
her
already
we
shall
be
the
very
best
of
friends
her
father
has
a
huge
farm
of
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
miles
and
she
has
two
horses
of
her
own
and
fords
rivers
when
out
riding
when
she
to
arrive
probably
she
travelling
by
the
and
coming
up
straight
from
london
to
school
directly
she
lands
i
hope
she
got
to
england
safely
she
must
have
left
home
ever
such
a
long
time
ago
how
fearfully
exciting
for
her
to
but
here
ulyth
reflections
were
brought
to
an
abrupt
close
for
the
train
was
approaching
glanafon
ferry
and
her
comrades
busily
collecting
their
various
handbags
would
lend
no
further
ear
to
her
remarks
the
little
wayside
station
erstwhile
the
quietest
and
sleepiest
on
the
line
was
soon
overflowing
with
girls
and
their
belongings
miss
moseley
flitted
up
and
down
the
platform
marshalling
her
charges
like
a
faithful
collie
the
one
porter
did
his
slow
best
and
after
a
few
agitated
returns
to
the
compartments
for
forgotten
articles
everything
was
successfully
collected
and
the
train
went
steaming
away
down
the
valley
in
the
direction
of
craigwen
it
seemed
to
take
the
last
link
of
civilization
with
it
and
to
leave
only
the
pure
unsullied
country
behind
the
girls
crossed
the
line
and
walked
through
the
white
station
gate
with
pleased
anticipation
writ
large
on
their
faces
it
was
the
cult
at
the
woodlands
to
idolize
nature
and
the
picturesque
and
they
had
reached
a
part
of
their
journey
which
was
a
particular
source
of
pride
to
the
school
any
admirer
of
scenery
would
have
been
struck
with
the
lovely
and
romantic
view
which
burst
upon
the
eye
as
the
travellers
left
the
platform
at
glanafon
and
walked
down
the
short
grassy
road
that
led
to
the
ferry
to
the
south
stretched
the
wide
pool
of
the
river
blue
as
the
heaven
above
where
it
caught
the
reflection
of
the
september
sky
but
dark
and
mysterious
where
it
mirrored
the
thick
woods
that
shaded
its
banks
near
at
hand
towered
the
tall
crag
of
cwm
dinas
while
the
rugged
peaks
of
penllwyd
and
penglaslyn
frowned
in
majesty
of
clouds
beyond
the
ferry
itself
was
one
of
those
delightful
survivals
of
mediævalism
which
linger
here
and
there
in
a
few
fortunate
corners
of
our
isles
a
large
boat
was
slung
on
chains
which
spanned
the
river
and
could
be
worked
slowly
across
the
water
by
means
of
a
small
windlass
though
it
was
perfectly
possible
and
often
even
more
convenient
to
drive
to
the
school
direct
from
llangarmon
junction
so
great
was
the
popular
feeling
in
favour
of
arrival
by
the
ferry
that
at
the
autumn
and
spring
reunions
the
girls
were
allowed
to
avail
themselves
of
the
branch
railway
and
approach
the
woodlands
by
way
of
the
river
they
now
hurried
on
to
the
boat
as
if
anticipating
a
the
capacities
of
the
flat
were
designed
to
accommodate
a
flock
of
sheep
or
a
farm
wagon
and
horses
so
there
was
room
and
to
spare
even
for
girls
and
their
hand
luggage
evan
davis
the
crusty
old
ferryman
greeted
them
with
his
usual
inarticulate
grunt
a
kind
of
oh
here
you
are
again
are
you
form
of
welcome
which
was
more
forceful
than
gracious
he
linked
the
protecting
chains
carefully
across
the
end
of
the
boat
called
out
a
remark
in
welsh
to
his
son
griffith
and
seizing
the
handle
began
to
work
the
windlass
very
slowly
and
leisurely
the
flat
swung
out
into
the
river
the
tide
was
at
the
full
and
the
wide
expanse
of
water
seemed
like
a
lake
the
clanking
chains
brought
up
bunches
of
seaweed
and
river
grass
which
fell
with
an
oozy
thud
upon
the
deck
the
mountain
air
blowing
straight
from
penllwyd
was
tinged
with
ozone
from
the
tide
the
girls
stood
looking
up
the
reach
of
water
towards
the
hills
and
tasting
the
salt
on
their
lips
with
supreme
gratification
it
was
not
every
school
that
assembled
by
such
a
romantic
means
of
conveyance
as
an
ancient
and
they
rejoiced
over
their
privileges
i
glad
the
tide
full
it
makes
the
crossing
so
much
wider
murmured
helen
cooper
with
an
eye
of
admiration
on
the
woods
do
suppose
evan
shares
your
enthusiasm
laughed
marjorie
earnshaw
he
paid
the
same
whatever
the
length
of
the
journey
old
grumps
gets
half
a
crown
for
his
job
so
he
need
grumble
put
in
doris
deane
oh
trust
him
he
look
sour
at
a
pound
note
what
makes
him
so
cross
oh
he
old
and
lame
i
suppose
and
has
a
crotchety
temper
here
we
are
at
last
the
boat
was
grating
on
the
shore
griffith
was
unfastening
the
movable
end
and
in
another
moment
the
girls
were
springing
out
gingerly
one
by
one
on
to
the
decidedly
muddy
that
formed
a
rough
causeway
to
the
bank
a
cart
was
waiting
to
convey
the
handbags
all
boxes
had
been
sent
as
advance
luggage
two
days
before
so
disencumbered
of
their
numerous
possessions
the
girls
started
to
walk
the
steep
uphill
mile
that
led
to
the
woodlands
miss
bowes
and
miss
teddington
the
partners
who
owned
the
school
had
been
exceptionally
fortunate
in
their
choice
of
a
house
if
as
runs
the
modern
theory
beautiful
surroundings
in
our
early
youth
are
of
the
utmost
importance
in
training
our
perceptions
and
aiding
the
growth
of
our
higher
selves
then
surely
nowhere
in
the
british
isles
could
a
more
suitable
setting
have
been
found
for
a
home
of
education
the
long
terrace
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
of
the
craigwen
valley
an
expanse
of
about
sixteen
miles
the
river
like
a
silver
ribbon
wound
through
woods
and
marshland
till
it
widened
into
a
broad
tidal
estuary
as
it
neared
the
sea
the
mountains
which
rose
tier
after
tier
from
the
level
green
meadows
had
their
lower
slopes
thickly
clothed
with
pines
and
larches
but
where
they
towered
above
the
level
of
a
thousand
feet
the
forest
growth
gave
way
to
gorse
and
bracken
and
their
jagged
summits
bare
of
all
vegetation
save
a
few
clumps
of
coarse
grass
showed
a
splintered
outline
against
the
sky
penllwyd
penglaslyn
and
glyder
garmon
those
lofty
peaks
like
three
strong
welsh
giants
seemed
to
guard
the
entrance
to
the
enchanted
valley
and
to
keep
it
a
place
apart
a
last
fortress
of
nature
a
sanctuary
for
birds
and
flowers
a
paradise
of
green
shade
and
leaping
waters
and
a
for
body
and
soul
the
house
named
the
woodlands
by
miss
bowes
in
place
of
its
older
but
rather
unpronounceable
name
of
llwyngwrydd
the
green
grove
took
both
its
welsh
and
english
appellations
from
a
beautiful
glade
planted
with
oaks
which
formed
the
southern
boundary
of
the
property
through
this
dell
flowed
a
mountain
stream
tumbling
in
little
white
cascades
between
the
big
boulders
that
formed
its
bed
and
pouring
in
quite
a
waterfall
over
a
ledge
of
rock
into
a
wide
pool
its
steady
rippling
murmur
never
stopped
and
could
be
heard
day
and
night
through
the
windows
gentle
and
subdued
in
dry
weather
but
rising
to
a
roar
when
rain
in
the
hills
brought
the
flood
down
in
a
turbulent
torrent
through
lessons
play
or
dreams
this
sound
of
many
waters
was
ever
present
it
gave
an
atmosphere
to
the
school
which
if
passed
unnoticed
through
extreme
familiarity
would
have
been
instantly
missed
if
it
could
have
stopped
to
the
girls
this
stream
was
a
kind
of
guardian
deity
with
the
glade
for
its
sacred
grove
they
loved
every
rock
and
stone
and
cataract
almost
every
patch
of
brown
moss
upon
its
boulders
each
morning
of
the
summer
term
they
bathed
before
breakfast
in
the
pool
where
a
big
shaded
the
cataract
it
was
so
close
to
the
house
that
they
could
run
out
in
mackintoshes
and
so
retired
that
it
resembled
a
private
here
they
enjoyed
themselves
like
splashing
in
the
shallows
plunging
in
the
pool
swinging
from
the
boughs
of
the
and
scrambling
over
the
lichened
boulders
it
was
a
source
of
deep
regret
to
the
hardier
spirits
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
take
their
morning
dip
in
the
stream
all
the
year
round
but
on
that
score
mistresses
were
adamant
and
with
the
close
of
september
the
naiads
perforce
withdrew
from
their
favourite
element
till
it
was
warmed
again
by
the
may
sunshine
the
house
itself
had
originally
been
an
ancient
welsh
dwelling
of
the
days
of
the
tudors
but
had
been
largely
added
to
in
later
times
the
straight
front
with
its
rows
of
windows
classic
doorway
and
terrace
was
certainly
georgian
in
type
and
the
tower
an
architectural
eyesore
was
plainly
victorian
the
taste
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
had
not
been
faultless
and
all
the
best
part
of
the
building
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
lay
at
the
back
this
mainly
consisted
of
kitchens
and
servants
quarters
but
there
still
remained
a
large
hall
which
was
the
chief
glory
of
the
establishment
it
was
very
lofty
for
in
common
with
other
specimens
of
the
period
it
had
no
upper
story
the
roof
being
timbered
like
that
of
a
church
the
walls
were
panelled
with
oak
to
a
height
of
about
eight
feet
and
above
that
were
decorated
with
elaborate
designs
in
plaster
relief
representing
lions
wild
boars
stags
unicorns
and
other
heraldic
devices
from
the
of
the
original
owner
of
the
estate
a
narrow
winding
staircase
led
to
a
minstrels
gallery
from
which
was
suspended
a
wooden
shield
emblazoned
with
the
welsh
dragon
and
the
national
motto
cymru
am
byth
wales
for
ever
if
the
hall
was
the
main
picturesque
asset
of
the
building
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
unromantic
front
portion
was
highly
convenient
and
had
been
most
readily
adaptable
for
a
school
the
large
light
rooms
of
the
ground
floor
made
excellent
classrooms
and
the
upper
story
was
so
lavishly
provided
with
windows
that
it
had
been
possible
by
means
of
wooden
partitions
to
turn
the
great
bedrooms
into
rows
of
small
dormitories
each
capable
of
accommodating
two
girls
the
bright
airy
house
the
terrace
with
its
glorious
view
of
the
valley
the
large
garden
and
above
all
the
stream
and
the
glade
made
a
very
pleasant
setting
for
the
school
life
of
the
pupils
at
the
woodlands
the
two
principals
worked
together
in
perfect
harmony
each
had
her
own
department
miss
bowes
who
was
short
stout
and
motherly
looked
after
the
housekeeping
the
hygiene
and
the
business
side
she
wrote
letters
to
parents
kept
the
accounts
interviewed
tradespeople
superintended
the
mending
and
was
the
final
referee
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
health
and
general
conduct
dear
old
rainbow
as
the
girls
nicknamed
her
was
frankly
popular
for
she
was
sympathetic
and
usually
disposed
to
listen
in
reason
to
the
various
plaints
which
were
brought
to
the
sanctum
of
her
private
her
authority
alone
could
excuse
preparation
order
breakfast
in
bed
remit
practising
dispense
jujubes
allow
special
festivities
and
grant
it
was
rumoured
that
she
thought
of
retiring
and
leaving
the
school
to
her
partner
and
such
a
report
always
drew
from
parents
the
opinion
that
she
would
be
greatly
missed
miss
teddington
younger
by
many
years
took
a
more
active
part
in
the
teaching
and
superintended
the
games
and
outdoor
sports
she
was
tall
and
athletic
a
good
mathematician
and
interested
in
archæology
and
nature
study
she
led
the
walks
and
rambles
taught
the
sixth
form
and
represented
the
more
scholastic
and
modern
element
her
enterprise
initiated
all
fresh
undertakings
and
her
enthusiasm
carried
them
forward
with
success
the
girls
sometimes
called
her
for
she
coddled
nobody
and
expected
the
utmost
from
each
one
capacity
if
she
was
rather
uncompromising
however
she
was
just
and
a
strong
vein
of
humour
toned
down
much
of
the
severity
of
her
remarks
to
be
chided
by
a
person
whose
eye
is
capable
of
twinkling
takes
part
of
the
sting
from
the
reprimand
and
the
general
verdict
of
the
school
was
to
the
effect
that
teddie
was
a
keen
old
but
her
bark
was
worse
than
her
bite
of
the
other
mistresses
and
girls
we
will
say
more
anon
having
introduced
my
readers
to
the
woodlands
it
is
time
for
the
story
to
begin
chapter
ii
a
friend
from
the
bush
ulyth
stanton
was
a
decided
personality
in
the
lower
fifth
if
not
exactly
pretty
she
was
a
dainty
little
damsel
and
knew
how
to
make
the
best
of
herself
her
fair
hair
was
glossy
and
waved
in
the
most
becoming
fashion
her
clothes
were
well
cut
her
gloves
and
shoes
immaculate
she
had
an
artistic
temperament
and
loved
to
be
surrounded
by
pretty
things
she
was
rather
a
favourite
at
the
woodlands
for
she
had
few
sharp
angles
and
possessed
a
fair
share
of
tact
if
the
girls
laughed
sometimes
at
what
they
called
her
notions
they
nevertheless
respected
her
opinions
and
admired
her
more
than
they
always
chose
to
admit
it
was
an
accepted
fact
that
ulyth
stuck
to
her
word
and
generally
carried
through
anything
that
she
once
undertook
she
alone
of
six
members
of
her
form
who
had
begun
to
correspond
with
girls
abroad
at
the
instigation
of
the
magazine
editor
had
written
regularly
and
had
cultivated
the
overseas
friendship
with
enthusiasm
the
element
of
romance
about
the
affair
had
appealed
to
ulyth
it
was
so
strange
to
receive
letters
from
someone
you
had
never
seen
to
be
sure
rona
had
only
given
a
somewhat
bald
account
of
her
home
and
her
doings
but
even
this
outline
was
so
different
from
english
life
that
imagination
filled
the
gaps
and
pictured
her
unknown
correspondent
among
scenes
of
unrivalled
interest
and
excitement
ulyth
had
once
seen
a
most
wonderful
film
entitled
rose
of
the
wilderness
and
though
the
scenes
depicted
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
region
of
the
wild
west
she
decided
that
they
would
equally
well
represent
the
backwoods
of
new
zealand
and
that
the
beautiful
dashing
daring
heroine
so
aptly
called
the
prairie
flower
was
probably
a
speaking
likeness
of
rona
mitchell
when
she
learnt
that
owing
to
her
letters
rona
father
had
determined
to
send
his
daughter
to
school
at
the
woodlands
her
excitement
was
immense
she
had
at
once
petitioned
miss
bowes
to
have
her
as
a
and
was
now
awaiting
her
advent
with
the
very
keenest
anticipation
there
was
a
little
uncertainty
about
the
time
of
the
new
girl
arrival
for
it
depended
upon
the
punctuality
of
the
ocean
liner
a
doubtful
matter
if
there
were
a
storm
and
the
feeling
that
she
might
be
expected
any
hour
between
and
made
havoc
of
ulyth
day
it
was
impossible
to
attend
to
lessons
when
she
was
listening
for
the
sound
of
a
taxi
on
the
drive
and
even
the
attractions
of
tennis
could
not
decoy
her
out
of
sight
of
the
front
door
i
must
be
the
very
first
to
welcome
her
she
persisted
of
course
it
not
the
same
to
all
the
rest
of
you
i
understand
that
she
to
be
my
special
property
my
prairie
rose
all
serene
if
you
care
to
waste
your
time
lounging
about
the
steps
you
can
we
not
in
such
a
frantic
state
to
see
your
paragon
laughed
the
girls
as
they
ran
down
the
garden
to
the
courts
after
all
the
waiting
was
in
vain
came
without
a
sign
of
the
it
was
unlikely
that
she
would
turn
up
now
until
the
evening
train
and
ulyth
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
but
when
the
school
was
almost
through
its
bread
and
butter
and
gooseberry
jam
a
sudden
commotion
occurred
in
the
hall
there
was
a
noise
such
as
nobody
ever
remembered
to
have
heard
at
the
woodlands
before
thank
goodness
gracious
i
got
meself
here
at
last
cried
a
loud
nasal
voice
where
i
stick
these
things
oh
yes
there
heaps
more
inside
that
automobile
travelling
no
joke
i
can
tell
you
i
tired
to
death
any
tea
about
i
could
drink
the
sea
my
gracious
i
had
a
time
of
it
coming
here
at
the
first
word
miss
bowes
had
glided
from
the
room
and
the
voice
died
away
as
the
door
of
her
private
study
closed
sounds
suggestive
of
the
carrying
upstairs
of
luggage
followed
and
a
hinnying
laugh
echoed
once
down
the
stairs
the
girls
looked
at
one
another
there
was
a
shadow
in
ulyth
eyes
she
did
not
share
in
the
general
smile
that
passed
round
the
table
and
she
finished
her
tea
in
dead
silence
going
to
sample
your
new
property
whispered
mary
acton
as
the
girls
pushed
back
their
chairs
what
the
formula
for
swearing
an
undying
friendship
giggled
addie
knighton
was
it
rose
of
sharon
you
called
her
twinkled
christine
crosswood
or
lily
of
the
valley
ulyth
did
not
reply
she
walked
upstairs
very
slowly
the
nasal
twang
of
that
voice
in
the
hall
had
wiped
the
bloom
off
her
anticipation
the
small
double
dormitory
in
which
she
slept
was
no
room
the
door
was
so
she
entered
without
knocking
both
beds
the
chairs
and
most
of
the
floor
was
strewn
with
an
assortment
of
miscellaneous
articles
on
the
was
a
tray
with
the
remains
of
tea
over
a
large
cabin
trunk
bent
a
girl
of
fourteen
she
straightened
herself
as
she
heard
footsteps
alas
alas
for
ulyth
illusions
the
enchanting
vision
of
the
prairie
flower
faded
and
rona
mitchell
stood
before
her
in
solid
fact
solid
was
the
word
for
it
no
fascinating
cinema
heroine
this
but
an
ordinary
decidedly
plump
damsel
with
brown
elf
locks
a
ruddy
sunburnt
complexion
and
a
freckled
nose
where
oh
where
were
the
delicate
features
the
figure
and
the
long
rich
clustering
curls
of
rose
of
the
wilderness
ulyth
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
as
one
dazed
then
with
an
effort
she
remembered
her
manners
and
introduced
herself
proud
to
meet
you
at
last
replied
the
heartily
you
and
i
had
a
friendship
switched
on
for
us
so
to
speak
i
liked
your
letters
awfully
glad
they
put
us
in
together
did
did
you
have
a
nice
journey
stammered
ulyth
it
was
a
most
conventional
enquiry
but
the
only
thing
she
could
think
of
to
say
beastly
it
was
rough
or
hot
all
the
time
and
we
did
get
much
fun
on
board
was
it
a
sell
too
disappointing
for
words
perkins
the
lady
who
had
charge
of
me
coming
over
was
just
a
tartar
nothing
i
did
seemed
to
suit
her
somehow
i
bet
she
was
glad
to
see
the
last
of
me
then
i
was
and
when
we
got
into
the
hot
zone
my
how
bad
i
was
my
face
was
just
skinned
with
sunburn
and
the
salt
air
made
it
worse
i
not
go
to
sea
again
for
pleasure
i
can
tell
you
i
say
be
glad
to
get
my
things
fixed
up
here
this
is
your
bed
and
your
side
of
the
room
returned
ulyth
hastily
collecting
some
of
the
articles
which
had
been
flung
anywhere
and
hanging
them
in
rona
wardrobe
miss
moseley
makes
us
be
very
tidy
she
be
coming
round
this
evening
to
inspect
rona
whistled
guess
she
drop
on
me
pretty
often
then
no
one
ever
called
neatness
my
strong
point
are
those
photos
on
the
mantelpiece
your
home
folks
i
going
to
look
at
them
what
a
lot
of
things
you
got
books
and
albums
and
goodness
knows
what
i
enjoy
turning
them
over
when
i
time
at
eight
that
night
a
few
members
of
the
lower
fifth
putting
away
books
in
their
classroom
stopped
to
compare
notes
well
what
do
you
think
of
your
adorable
one
ulyth
asked
stephanie
radford
a
little
spitefully
you
welcome
to
her
company
so
far
as
i
concerned
rose
of
the
wilderness
indeed
mocked
merle
denham
your
prairie
rose
is
nothing
but
a
dandelion
remarked
christine
crosswood
i
never
heard
anyone
with
such
an
awful
laugh
said
lizzie
lonsdale
do
implored
ulyth
tragically
i
had
the
shock
of
my
life
she
oh
she
too
terrible
for
words
her
voice
makes
me
cringe
and
she
pawed
all
my
things
she
snatched
up
my
photos
and
turned
over
my
books
with
sticky
fingers
she
even
opened
my
drawers
and
peeped
inside
what
cheek
oh
she
has
the
slightest
idea
of
how
to
behave
herself
she
asked
me
a
whole
string
of
the
most
impertinent
questions
what
i
paid
for
my
clothes
and
how
long
they
have
to
last
me
she
unbearable
yes
absolutely
impossible
ugh
and
i
got
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
her
poor
martyr
it
hard
luck
sympathized
lizzie
why
did
you
write
and
ask
the
rainbow
to
put
you
together
it
was
rather
buying
a
pig
in
a
poke
was
it
i
never
dreamt
she
be
like
this
it
sounded
so
romantic
you
see
living
on
a
huge
farm
and
having
two
horses
to
ride
i
shall
go
to
miss
bowes
first
thing
morning
and
ask
to
have
her
moved
out
of
my
room
i
only
wish
there
was
time
to
do
it
this
evening
oh
why
did
i
ever
write
to
her
and
make
her
want
to
come
to
this
school
poor
old
ulyth
you
certainly
let
yourself
in
for
more
than
you
bargained
for
laughed
the
girls
half
sorry
for
her
and
half
amused
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
very
instant
that
miss
bowes
was
installed
in
her
study
a
sounded
on
her
door
come
in
she
called
and
sighed
as
ulyth
entered
for
she
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
of
what
she
was
about
to
hear
please
miss
bowes
i
sorry
to
have
to
ask
a
favour
but
may
rona
be
changed
into
another
dormitory
why
ulyth
you
wrote
to
me
specially
and
asked
if
you
might
have
her
for
a
yes
i
did
but
i
had
seen
her
then
i
thought
she
be
so
different
is
it
a
little
too
soon
to
judge
you
have
known
her
hours
yet
i
know
as
much
of
her
as
i
ever
want
to
oh
miss
bowes
dreadful
i
never
like
her
i
ca
have
her
in
my
room
i
simply
ca
there
was
a
shake
suggestive
of
tears
in
ulyth
voice
her
eyes
looked
heavy
as
if
she
had
not
slept
miss
bowes
sighed
again
rona
may
be
exactly
what
you
imagined
but
you
must
remember
in
what
different
circumstances
she
has
been
brought
up
i
think
she
has
many
good
qualities
and
that
she
soon
improve
now
let
us
look
at
the
matter
from
her
point
of
view
you
have
been
writing
to
her
constantly
for
two
years
she
has
come
here
specially
to
be
near
you
you
are
her
only
friend
in
a
new
and
strange
country
where
she
is
many
thousand
miles
away
from
her
own
home
you
gave
her
a
cordial
invitation
to
england
and
now
because
she
does
not
happen
to
realize
your
quite
unfounded
expectations
you
want
to
back
out
of
all
your
obligations
to
her
i
thought
you
were
a
girl
ulyth
who
kept
her
promises
ulyth
fingered
the
corner
of
the
tablecloth
nervously
for
a
moment
then
she
burst
out
i
ca
miss
bowes
i
simply
ca
if
you
knew
how
she
grates
upon
me
oh
it
too
much
i
rather
have
a
bear
cub
or
a
monkey
for
a
please
please
do
make
us
stop
together
if
you
wo
move
her
move
me
i
sleep
in
an
attic
if
i
could
have
it
to
myself
you
must
stay
where
you
are
until
the
end
of
the
week
you
owe
that
to
rona
at
any
rate
afterwards
i
shall
not
force
you
but
leave
it
to
your
own
good
feeling
i
want
you
to
think
over
what
i
have
been
saying
you
can
come
on
sunday
morning
and
tell
me
your
decision
i
know
what
the
answer
will
be
murmured
ulyth
as
she
went
from
the
room
she
was
very
angry
with
miss
bowes
with
rona
and
with
herself
for
her
own
folly
it
ridiculous
to
expect
me
to
take
up
this
savage
she
argued
and
too
bad
of
miss
bowes
to
make
out
that
i
breaking
my
word
oh
dear
what
am
i
to
write
home
to
mother
how
can
i
tell
her
i
believe
just
send
her
a
picture
post
card
and
only
say
rona
has
come
and
no
more
miss
bowes
has
no
right
to
coerce
me
i
make
my
own
friends
no
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
she
sha
cram
rona
down
my
throat
to
have
that
awful
girl
eternally
in
my
bedroom
i
should
die
after
all
her
heroics
it
was
a
terrible
for
poor
ulyth
now
the
actual
had
taken
the
place
of
the
sentimental
her
could
not
forbear
teasing
her
a
little
it
was
too
bad
of
them
but
then
they
had
resented
her
entire
of
the
and
moreover
had
one
or
two
old
scores
from
last
term
to
pay
off
ulyth
began
to
detest
the
very
name
of
the
prairie
flower
she
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
been
so
silly
i
ought
to
have
been
warned
she
thought
trying
to
throw
the
blame
on
to
somebody
else
no
one
ever
suggested
she
be
like
this
the
editor
of
the
magazine
really
should
have
persuaded
us
to
write
it
all
his
fault
in
the
beginning
though
the
rest
of
the
girls
were
scarcely
impressed
with
personality
they
were
not
utterly
repelled
she
rather
pretty
ventured
lizzie
lonsdale
her
eyes
are
the
bluest
i
ever
seen
and
her
teeth
are
so
white
and
even
added
beth
broadway
she
looks
jolly
when
she
smiles
perhaps
she
smarten
up
soon
suggested
addie
knighton
that
blue
dress
suits
her
it
just
matches
her
eyes
to
ulyth
fastidious
taste
rona
clothes
looked
hopelessly
and
colonial
especially
as
her
put
them
on
anyhow
and
seemed
to
have
no
regard
at
all
for
appearances
a
girl
who
did
not
mind
whether
she
looked
really
trim
spruce
and
smart
must
indeed
have
spent
her
life
in
the
backwoods
did
you
even
have
a
governess
in
new
zealand
she
ventured
one
day
she
did
not
encourage
rona
to
talk
but
for
once
her
curiosity
overcame
her
dislike
of
the
voice
could
get
one
to
stop
where
we
were
barker
our
cowman
wife
looked
after
me
ever
since
mother
died
she
was
the
only
woman
about
the
place
one
of
our
farm
helps
taught
me
lessons
he
was
a
of
oxford
but
down
on
his
luck
dad
said
i
seem
queer
to
english
girls
i
do
know
that
i
care
though
rona
might
not
be
possessed
of
the
most
delicate
perceptions
she
nevertheless
had
common
sense
enough
to
realize
that
ulyth
did
not
receive
her
with
enthusiasm
i
suppose
you
disappointed
in
me
she
queried
dad
said
you
would
be
but
i
laughed
at
him
pity
if
our
friendship
turned
out
a
misfit
i
think
you
no
end
dad
said
i
got
to
copy
you
it
take
me
all
my
time
i
expect
things
are
so
different
here
from
home
was
there
a
suspicion
of
a
choke
in
the
words
ulyth
had
a
sudden
pang
of
compunction
unwelcome
as
her
companion
was
to
her
she
did
not
wish
to
be
brutal
you
must
get
she
said
hastily
you
shake
down
here
in
time
everyone
finds
things
strange
at
school
just
at
first
i
did
myself
i
guess
you
were
never
as
much
a
fish
out
of
water
as
me
though
returned
rona
and
went
whistling
down
the
passage
ulyth
tried
to
dismiss
her
from
her
thoughts
she
did
not
intend
to
worry
over
rona
more
than
she
could
possibly
help
fortunately
they
were
not
together
in
class
for
rona
papers
had
not
reached
the
standard
of
the
lower
fifth
and
she
had
been
placed
in
iv
ulyth
was
interested
in
her
she
stood
well
with
her
teachers
and
was
an
acknowledged
force
in
her
form
she
came
from
a
very
refined
and
cultured
home
where
intellectual
interests
were
cultivated
both
by
father
and
mother
her
temperament
was
naturally
artistic
she
was
an
omnivorous
reader
and
could
devour
anything
in
the
shape
of
literature
that
came
her
way
the
bookcase
in
her
dormitory
was
filled
with
beautiful
volumes
mostly
christmas
and
birthday
gifts
she
rejoiced
in
their
soft
leather
bindings
or
fine
illustrations
with
a
true
enthusiasm
it
was
her
pride
to
keep
them
in
daintiest
condition
or
were
in
her
opinion
the
depths
of
degradation
ulyth
had
ambitions
also
ambitions
which
she
would
not
reveal
to
anybody
some
day
she
planned
to
write
a
book
of
her
own
she
had
not
yet
fixed
on
a
subject
but
she
had
decided
just
what
the
cover
was
to
be
like
with
her
name
on
it
in
gilt
letters
perhaps
she
might
even
illustrate
it
herself
for
her
love
of
art
almost
equalled
her
love
of
literature
but
that
was
still
in
the
clouds
and
must
wait
till
she
had
chosen
her
plot
in
the
interim
she
wrote
verses
and
short
stories
for
the
school
magazine
and
her
essays
for
miss
teddington
were
generally
returned
marked
highly
creditable
this
term
ulyth
intended
to
study
hard
it
was
a
promotion
to
be
in
the
upper
school
she
was
beginning
several
new
subjects
and
her
interest
in
many
things
was
aroused
it
would
be
a
delightful
autumn
as
soon
as
she
had
got
rid
of
this
dreadful
problem
at
present
the
one
serious
obstacle
to
her
comfort
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
only
friday
and
till
at
least
the
following
monday
she
would
be
obliged
to
endure
her
uncongenial
presence
in
her
bedroom
chapter
iii
round
the
it
was
the
first
saturday
of
the
term
so
far
the
girls
had
been
kept
busily
occupied
settling
down
to
work
in
their
fresh
forms
and
trying
to
grow
accustomed
to
miss
teddington
new
now
however
they
were
free
to
relax
and
enjoy
themselves
in
any
way
they
chose
some
were
playing
tennis
some
had
gone
for
a
walk
with
miss
moseley
a
few
were
squatting
on
boulders
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
and
others
strolled
under
the
trees
in
the
grove
thank
goodness
the
weather
behaving
itself
said
mary
acton
who
with
a
few
other
members
of
the
lower
fifth
was
sitting
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
oak
do
you
remember
last
council
it
simply
poured
the
thing
no
fun
if
one
ca
have
a
real
fire
it
burn
returned
lizzie
lonsdale
there
a
little
wind
and
the
wood
be
dry
that
reminds
me
i
have
found
my
faggot
yet
said
beth
broadway
easily
girl
alive
then
you
better
go
and
look
for
one
or
you
be
all
in
a
scramble
at
the
last
bother
i
too
comfy
to
move
nice
you
look
if
you
come
i
appropriate
half
your
lot
first
lizzikins
would
you
indeed
i
denounce
you
and
you
lose
your
rank
and
be
degraded
to
a
candidate
again
oh
you
mean
stingy
miser
not
at
all
it
the
wise
and
foolish
virgins
over
again
i
sha
have
enough
for
myself
and
you
i
a
lovely
little
stack
just
enough
for
one
reposing
no
i
better
not
tell
you
where
do
look
so
hopeful
you
not
to
be
trusted
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
rona
mitchell
who
had
wandered
up
to
the
group
why
are
some
of
you
picking
up
sticks
i
saw
a
girl
over
there
with
quite
a
bundle
just
now
you
might
tell
me
so
far
rona
had
not
been
well
received
in
her
own
form
iv
b
she
was
older
than
her
and
they
instead
of
attempting
to
initiate
her
into
the
ways
of
the
woodlands
girls
on
this
holiday
afternoon
had
scuttled
off
and
left
her
to
fend
for
herself
she
looked
such
an
odd
wistful
lonely
figure
that
lizzie
lonsdale
kind
heart
smote
her
she
pushed
the
other
girls
farther
along
the
till
they
made
a
grudging
space
for
the
i
a
good
hand
at
if
you
want
any
help
continued
rona
seating
herself
with
alacrity
i
made
by
the
dozen
at
home
and
cooked
by
them
too
just
let
me
know
where
you
want
it
and
i
set
to
work
you
would
be
allowed
said
beth
bluntly
this
fire
is
a
very
special
thing
only
may
bring
the
fuel
no
one
else
is
eligible
why
on
earth
not
oh
i
ca
bother
to
explain
now
it
would
take
too
long
you
find
out
girls
i
going
in
turn
up
here
at
dusk
if
you
want
to
know
and
bring
a
cup
with
you
suggested
lizzie
with
a
effort
at
friendliness
as
she
followed
her
chums
you
bet
i
turn
up
rather
that
evening
just
after
sunset
little
groups
of
girls
began
to
collect
round
an
open
green
space
in
the
glade
they
came
quietly
and
with
a
certain
sense
of
discipline
a
stranger
would
have
noticed
that
if
any
loud
tone
or
undue
hilarity
made
itself
heard
it
was
instantly
and
firmly
repressed
by
one
or
two
who
seemed
in
authority
that
the
meeting
was
more
in
the
nature
of
a
convention
than
a
mere
was
evident
both
from
the
demeanour
of
the
assemblage
and
from
the
various
badges
pinned
on
the
girls
coats
no
teacher
was
present
but
there
was
an
air
of
general
expectancy
as
if
the
coming
of
somebody
were
awaited
to
the
pupils
at
the
woodlands
this
night
ceremony
was
a
very
special
occasion
for
it
was
the
autumn
reunion
of
the
league
an
organization
which
originally
of
american
birth
had
been
introduced
at
the
instigation
of
miss
teddington
and
had
taken
great
root
in
the
school
any
girl
was
eligible
as
a
candidate
but
before
she
could
gain
admission
to
even
the
initial
rank
she
had
to
prove
herself
worthy
of
the
honour
of
membership
and
pass
successfully
through
her
novitiate
the
organizer
and
leader
of
the
branch
which
was
to
celebrate
its
third
anniversary
was
a
certain
arnold
a
charming
young
american
lady
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
she
had
been
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
the
league
in
pennsylvania
before
her
marriage
and
was
delighted
to
pass
on
its
traditions
to
british
schoolgirls
her
winsome
personality
made
her
a
prime
favourite
at
the
woodlands
where
her
influence
was
stronger
even
than
she
imagined
miss
teddington
though
it
was
she
who
had
asked
arnold
to
institute
and
take
charge
of
the
meetings
had
the
discretion
to
keep
out
of
the
league
herself
realizing
that
the
presence
of
teachers
might
be
a
restraint
and
that
the
management
was
better
left
in
the
hands
of
a
trustworthy
outsider
to
become
an
authorized
member
was
an
ambition
with
most
of
the
girls
and
spurred
many
on
to
greater
efforts
than
they
would
otherwise
have
attempted
all
looked
forward
to
the
meetings
and
there
could
be
no
greater
punishment
for
certain
offences
than
a
temporary
withdrawal
of
league
privileges
this
september
after
the
long
summer
holiday
the
reunion
seemed
of
even
more
than
ordinary
importance
the
sun
had
set
the
last
gleam
of
the
afterglow
had
faded
and
the
glade
had
grown
full
of
dim
shadows
by
the
time
everybody
was
present
in
the
grove
the
gentle
rustle
of
the
leafy
boughs
overhead
and
the
persistent
tumbling
rush
of
the
stream
seemed
like
a
faint
orchestral
accompaniment
of
nature
for
the
ceremonial
is
it
a
quakers
meeting
or
a
freemasons
lodge
you
all
very
mum
asked
rona
whom
curiosity
had
led
out
with
the
others
we
waiting
for
our
of
the
fire
returned
ulyth
trying
to
suppress
the
loudness
of
the
voice
arnold
generally
very
punctual
oh
there
i
believe
i
hear
her
ringing
her
bicycle
bell
now
i
going
down
the
field
to
meet
her
ulyth
regarded
arnold
with
that
intense
adoration
which
a
girl
of
fifteen
often
bestows
on
a
woman
older
than
herself
she
ran
now
through
the
wood
hoping
she
might
be
in
time
to
catch
her
idol
on
the
drive
and
have
just
a
few
precious
moments
with
her
before
she
was
joined
by
the
others
there
were
many
things
she
wanted
to
pour
into
her
ready
ears
but
she
knew
it
would
be
impossible
to
monopolize
her
as
soon
as
the
rest
of
the
girls
knew
of
her
arrival
she
fled
as
on
wings
therefore
and
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
being
the
first
in
the
field
arnold
young
very
fair
graceful
and
looked
a
picture
in
her
blue
cycling
costume
as
she
leaned
her
machine
against
a
tree
and
greeted
her
enthusiastic
admirer
oh
you
darling
i
such
heaps
to
tell
you
began
ulyth
clasping
her
tightly
by
the
arm
rona
mitchell
has
come
and
she
the
most
awful
creature
i
never
was
so
disappointed
in
my
life
do
you
sympathize
with
me
when
i
expected
her
to
be
so
ripping
she
absolute
backwoods
yes
i
heard
all
about
her
poor
child
she
must
have
had
a
strange
training
it
time
indeed
she
began
to
learn
something
she
not
learned
anything
in
new
zealand
oh
her
voice
will
just
grate
on
you
and
her
manners
she
hopeless
everything
she
does
and
says
is
wrong
and
to
think
she
been
foisted
on
to
me
of
all
people
poor
child
repeated
arnold
which
of
us
does
she
mean
thought
ulyth
she
evidently
raw
material
every
diamond
needs
polishing
what
an
opportunity
for
a
ulyth
dropped
her
friend
arm
suddenly
it
was
not
at
all
the
answer
she
had
expected
moreover
at
least
a
dozen
girls
had
come
running
up
and
were
claiming
their
chief
attention
in
a
species
of
triumphant
procession
arnold
was
escorted
into
the
glade
and
installed
on
her
throne
of
state
a
seat
made
of
logs
and
decorated
with
ferns
everyone
clustered
round
to
welcome
her
and
for
the
moment
she
was
the
centre
of
an
enthusiastic
crowd
ulyth
followed
more
slowly
she
was
feeling
disturbed
and
put
out
what
did
arnold
mean
surely
not
a
sudden
thought
had
flashed
into
her
mind
but
she
thrust
it
away
indignantly
oh
no
that
was
quite
impossible
it
was
outrageous
of
anybody
to
make
the
suggestion
and
yet
and
yet
the
uneasy
voice
that
had
been
haunting
her
for
the
last
four
days
began
to
speak
with
even
more
vehemence
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
heard
the
signal
given
for
attention
and
cast
the
matter
away
from
her
for
the
moment
every
eye
was
fixed
on
their
leader
the
ceremony
was
about
to
begin
arnold
rose
and
in
her
clear
sweet
voice
proclaimed
the
guardian
of
the
fire
calls
on
the
to
bring
their
fuel
at
once
a
dozen
girls
came
forward
each
dragging
a
tolerably
large
bundle
of
brushwood
they
deposited
these
in
a
circle
saluted
and
retired
do
your
work
commanded
the
leader
eight
girls
responded
ulyth
among
the
number
and
seizing
the
brushwood
they
built
it
deftly
into
a
pile
all
stood
round
waiting
in
silence
while
their
chief
struck
a
match
and
applied
a
light
to
some
dried
leaves
and
bracken
that
had
been
placed
beneath
the
flame
rose
up
like
a
scarlet
ribbon
and
in
a
few
moments
the
dry
fuel
was
ablaze
and
crackling
the
gleam
lighting
up
the
glade
displayed
a
picturesque
scene
the
boles
of
the
trees
might
have
been
the
pillars
in
some
ancient
temple
with
the
branches
for
roof
close
by
the
cascade
of
the
stream
leapt
white
against
a
background
of
dim
darkness
the
harvest
moon
full
and
golden
was
rising
behind
the
crest
of
cwm
dinas
an
owl
flew
hooting
from
the
wood
higher
up
the
glen
arnold
stood
waiting
until
the
bonfire
was
well
alight
then
she
turned
to
the
expectant
girls
i
no
need
to
tell
most
of
you
why
we
have
met
here
but
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
who
are
to
the
woodlands
i
should
like
briefly
to
explain
the
objects
of
the
league
the
purpose
of
the
organization
is
to
show
that
the
common
things
of
daily
life
are
the
chief
means
of
beauty
romance
and
adventure
to
cultivate
the
outdoor
habit
and
to
help
girls
to
serve
the
community
the
larger
home
as
well
as
the
individual
home
in
these
times
we
must
especially
devote
ourselves
to
the
service
of
the
country
and
try
by
every
means
in
our
power
to
make
our
league
of
some
national
use
first
let
us
repeat
together
the
rules
of
the
league
seek
beauty
give
service
pursue
knowledge
be
trustworthy
hold
on
to
health
glorify
work
be
happy
seeking
beauty
includes
more
than
looking
for
superficial
adornment
beauty
is
in
all
life
in
nature
in
people
in
the
love
of
one
heart
in
virtue
and
a
radiant
disposition
the
value
of
service
depends
largely
upon
the
attitude
of
mind
of
the
one
rendering
it
joy
in
the
performance
of
some
needed
service
in
behalf
of
parent
teacher
friend
or
country
constitutes
a
part
of
the
very
essence
of
goodness
and
multiplies
the
good
already
abiding
in
the
heart
this
is
the
third
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
a
branch
of
the
league
at
the
woodlands
so
far
the
work
has
been
very
encouraging
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
we
have
candidates
eligible
for
all
three
ranks
it
shall
now
be
the
business
of
the
meeting
formally
to
admit
them
candidates
for
present
yourselves
six
of
the
younger
girls
came
forward
and
saluted
can

the

my
strength

joy

my
sorrow

the
love
of

for

arnold
said
a
few
kind
words
to
each
as
she
pinned
on
their
red
badges
only
novices
who
had
stood
the
various
tests
with
credit
were
raised
to
the
honour
of
the
second
rank

who
had
failed
must
perforce
continue
as
for
another
period
of
three
months
there
remained
one
further
and
higher
rank
only
attainable
after
six
months
ardent
and
trustworthy
service
as
three
girls
were
to
be
admitted
to
its
privileges
and
helen
cooper
doris
deane
and
ulyth
stanton
presented
themselves
with
grave
faces
they
repeated
the
desire
that
light
which
has
been
given
to
me
i
desire
to
pass
undimmed
to
others
ulyth
kissed
arnold
pretty
hand
as
the
yellow
badge
was
fastened
on
to
her
dress
side
by
side
with
the
union
jack
she
was
so
glad
to
be
a
at
last
she
had
become
a
candidate
when
the
league
was
first
founded
three
years
ago
and
all
that
time
she
had
been
slowly
working
towards
the
desired
end
of
the
third
rank
one
or
two
slips
had
hindered
her
progress
but
last
term
she
had
made
a
very
special
effort
and
it
was
sweet
to
meet
with
her
reward
were
mostly
to
be
found
among
the
sixth
and
upper
fifth
she
was
the
only
girl
in
v
b
who
had
won
so
high
a
place
she
touched
the
yellow
ribbon
tenderly
it
meant
so
much
to
her
now
that
the
serious
business
of
the
meeting
was
over
the
fun
was
about
to
begin
the
big
was
produced
and
filled
at
the
stream
and
then
set
to
boil
upon
the
embers
cups
and
spoons
made
their
appearance
cocoa
and
biscuits
were
to
be
the
order
of
the
evening
followed
by
as
many
songs
dances
and
games
as
time
permitted
squatting
on
the
grass
the
girls
made
a
circle
round
their
marjorie
earnshaw
one
of
the
sixth
had
brought
her
guitar
and
struck
the
strings
every
now
and
then
as
an
earnest
of
the
music
she
intended
to
bring
from
it
later
on
everybody
was
in
a
jolly
mood
and
inclined
to
laugh
at
any
pun
however
feeble
arnold
always
bright
and
animated
surpassed
herself
and
waxed
so
amusing
that
the
circle
grew
almost
hysterical
the
whose
office
it
was
to
mix
the
cocoa
supplied
cup
after
cup
and
refilled
the
kettle
so
often
that
they
ventured
to
air
the
joke
that
the
stream
would
run
dry
for
which
ancient
chestnut
they
were
pelted
with
pebbles
when
at
last
nobody
could
even
pretend
to
be
thirsty
any
longer
the
cups
were
rinsed
in
the
pool
and
stacked
under
a
tree
and
the
concert
commenced
and
catches
sounded
delightful
in
the
open
air
and
solos
sung
to
the
accompaniment
of
marjorie
guitar
were
equally
effective
the
girls
roared
the
choruses
to
popular
national
ditties
and
special
favourites
were
repeated
again
and
again
several
were
executed
and
had
a
weird
effect
in
the
unsteady
light
of
the
waning
fire
arnold
who
was
a
splendid
elocutionist
gave
a
recitation
on
an
incident
in
the
american
war
and
was
enthusiastically
encored
the
moon
had
risen
high
in
the
sky
and
was
peeping
through
the
as
if
curious
to
see
who
had
invaded
so
sylvan
a
spot
as
the
glade
the
silver
beams
caught
the
ripples
of
the
stream
and
made
the
shadows
seem
all
the
darker
it
was
a
glorious
beginning
for
the
new
term
as
everybody
agreed
and
an
earnest
of
the
fun
that
was
in
store
later
on
we
sha
be
able
to
camp
out
next
meeting
but
we
have
high
jinks
in
the
hall
purred
beth
broadway
yes
arnold
says
she
has
a
lovely
programme
for
the
winter
and
we
to
have
candles
instead
of
fuel
agreed
lizzie
lonsdale
who
had
been
raised
that
evening
to
the
rank
of
trust
arnold
to
find
something
new
for
us
to
do
murmured
ulyth
looking
fondly
in
the
direction
of
her
ideal
my
gracious
i
call
this
meeting
no
end
piped
a
cheerful
voice
in
her
ear
and
rona
smiling
with
friendliness
plumped
down
by
her
side
you
good
times
here
and
no
mistake
i
think
i
be
a
candidate
myself
next
if
that
the
game
to
play
you
a
one
are
you
let
have
a
look
at
your
badge
if
you
dare
to
touch
it
flared
ulyth
putting
up
her
hand
to
guard
her
cherished
token
why
i
would
do
it
any
harm
i
promise
you
i
would
finger
it
it
means
something
does
it
i
did
quite
catch
what
it
was
you
might
tell
me
how
i
ever
to
get
to
know
if
you
wo
rona
clear
blue
eyes
unconsciously
wistful
looked
straight
into
ulyth
the
latter
sprang
to
her
feet
without
a
word
the
force
of
her
own
motto
seemed
suddenly
to
be
revealed
to
her
she
rushed
away
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
to
think
it
over
for
herself
that
light
which
has
been
given
to
me
i
desire
to
pass
undimmed
to
others
those
were
the
words
she
had
repeated
so
earnestly
less
than
an
hour
ago
and
she
was
already
about
to
make
them
a
mockery
yes
that
was
what
arnold
had
meant
she
had
known
it
all
the
time
but
she
would
not
acknowledge
it
even
to
her
innermost
heart
was
this
what
was
required
from
a
to
pass
on
her
own
refinement
and
culture
to
a
girl
whose
crudities
offended
every
particle
of
her
fastidious
taste
ulyth
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
wept
hot
bitter
rebellious
tears
she
understood
only
too
well
why
she
had
been
so
miserable
for
the
last
three
days
she
had
disliked
miss
bowes
for
hinting
that
she
was
not
keeping
her
word
and
had
told
herself
that
she
was
a
and
person
i
must
do
it
i
must
or
fail
at
the
very
beginning
she
sobbed
i
know
what
mother
would
say
it
got
to
be
if
for
nothing
else
for
the
sake
of
the
school
a
must
shirk
and
break
her
pledge
oh
how
i
shall
loathe
it
hate
it
ulyth
stanton
do
you
realize
what
you
undertaking
your
whole
term
going
to
be
spoilt
the
big
bell
in
the
tower
was
clanging
its
summons
to
return
with
short
impatient
strokes
everybody
joined
hands
in
a
circle
round
the
ashes
of
the
to
sing
in
a
low
chant
the
song
of
the
league
and
god
save
the
queen
arnold
who
had
come
to
fetch
his
wife
was
sounding
his
hooter
as
a
signal
on
the
drive
the
evening
fun
was
over
regretfully
the
girls
collected
cups
spoons
and
kettle
and
made
their
way
back
to
the
house
on
sunday
morning
ulyth
with
a
very
red
face
marched
into
the
study
and
announced
miss
bowes
i
been
having
a
tussle
of
me
said
have
rona
in
your
room
at
any
price
and
the
other
half
said
her
stop
i
decided
to
keep
her
i
knew
you
would
when
you
thought
it
over
beamed
miss
bowes
are
all
new
zealanders
the
same
asked
ulyth
i
not
met
one
before
certainly
not
most
of
them
are
quite
as
cultured
and
as
ourselves
there
are
splendid
schools
in
new
zealand
and
excellent
opportunities
for
study
of
every
kind
poor
rona
unfortunately
has
had
to
live
on
a
farm
far
away
from
civilization
and
her
education
and
welfare
in
every
respect
seem
to
have
been
utterly
neglected
do
take
her
as
a
type
of
new
zealand
but
she
soon
improve
if
we
all
prepared
to
help
her
i
glad
you
ready
to
be
her
real
friend
i
try
my
best
sighed
ulyth
chapter
iv
a
blackberry
foray
having
made
up
her
mind
to
accept
the
responsibility
which
fate
through
the
agency
of
the
magazine
editor
had
thrust
upon
her
ulyth
metaphorically
speaking
set
her
teeth
and
began
to
take
rona
seriously
in
hand
being
ten
months
older
than
her
protégée
in
a
higher
form
and
moreover
armed
with
full
authority
from
miss
bowes
she
assumed
command
of
the
bedroom
and
tried
to
regulate
the
chaos
that
reigned
on
her
comrade
side
of
it
rona
submitted
with
an
air
of
amused
good
nature
to
have
her
clothes
arranged
in
order
in
her
drawers
her
shoes
put
away
in
the
cupboard
and
her
toilet
articles
allotted
places
on
her
washstand
and
she
even
consented
to
give
some
thought
to
her
personal
appearance
and
borrowed
ulyth
new
manicure
set
you
mighty
particular
she
objected
what
does
it
all
matter
miss
bowes
gave
me
such
a
and
said
i
got
to
do
exactly
what
you
told
me
and
before
i
came
dad
rubbed
it
into
me
to
copy
you
for
all
i
was
worth
so
i
suppose
i
have
to
try
i
guess
you
find
it
a
job
to
civilize
me
though
and
her
eyes
twinkled
ulyth
thought
with
a
mental
sigh
that
she
probably
would
find
it
a
job
no
one
bothered
about
it
at
home
rona
continued
cheerfully
dad
did
say
sometimes
i
was
growing
up
a
savage
but
barker
never
cared
she
let
me
do
what
i
liked
so
long
as
i
did
trouble
her
she
was
no
lady
we
could
get
a
lady
to
stay
at
our
block
dad
used
to
be
a
swell
in
england
once
but
that
was
before
i
was
born
ulyth
began
to
understand
and
her
disgust
changed
to
a
profound
pity
a
motherless
girl
who
had
run
wild
in
the
backwoods
her
father
probably
out
all
day
her
only
female
guide
a
woman
of
the
backwoods
whose
manners
were
presumably
of
the
roughest
this
had
been
rona
training
no
wonder
she
lacked
polish
when
i
compare
her
home
with
my
home
and
my
lovely
mother
thought
ulyth
yes
there
certainly
a
vast
amount
to
be
passed
on
the
other
girls
who
had
never
expected
her
to
keep
rona
in
her
bedroom
were
inclined
to
poke
fun
at
the
proceeding
your
bear
cub
will
need
training
before
you
teach
her
to
dance
said
stephanie
radford
tauntingly
she
has
no
parlour
tricks
at
present
sniggered
addie
knighton
are
you
posing
as
valentine
and
orson
laughed
gertie
oliver
gertrude
had
been
ulyth
last
term
and
felt
aggrieved
to
be
superseded
i
call
her
the
cuckoo
said
mary
acton
do
you
remember
the
young
one
we
found
last
spring
sprawling
all
over
the
nest
and
opening
its
huge
gaping
beak
in
spite
of
her
ignorance
and
angularities
there
was
a
certain
charm
about
the
when
the
sunburn
caused
by
her
had
yielded
to
a
course
of
treatment
it
left
her
with
a
complexion
which
put
even
that
of
stephanie
radford
the
acknowledged
school
beauty
in
the
shade
the
coral
tinge
in
rona
cheeks
was
as
doris
deane
enviously
remarked
almost
too
good
to
look
natural
and
her
blue
eyes
with
the
big
pupils
and
the
little
dark
rims
round
the
iris
shone
like
twinkling
stars
when
she
laughed
that
ninnying
laugh
to
be
sure
was
still
somewhat
offensive
but
she
was
trying
to
moderate
it
and
only
when
she
forgot
did
it
break
out
to
scandalize
the
refined
atmosphere
of
the
woodlands
the
small
white
even
teeth
which
it
displayed
and
two
conspicuous
dimples
almost
atoned
for
it
the
brown
hair
was
brushed
and
waved
and
its
consequent
state
of
new
glossiness
was
a
very
distinct
improvement
on
the
former
elf
locks
in
the
sunshine
it
took
tones
of
warm
burnt
sienna
like
the
hair
of
the
madonna
in
certain
of
great
pictures
lessons
alack
were
uphill
work
rona
was
naturally
bright
but
some
subjects
she
had
never
touched
before
and
in
others
she
was
hopelessly
backward
the
general
feeling
in
the
school
was
that
the
cuckoo
as
they
nicknamed
her
was
an
experiment
and
no
one
could
guess
exactly
what
she
would
grow
into
she
like
one
of
those
queer
beasties
we
dug
up
under
the
last
autumn
suggested
merle
denham
those
wriggling
transparent
things
i
mean
do
you
remember
we
kept
them
in
a
box
and
know
whether
they
turn
out
moths
or
butterflies
or
earwigs
or
woodlice
they
turned
into
cockchafer
beetles
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
ulyth
drily
well
they
were
horrid
enough
in
all
conscience
i
do
like
nature
study
when
it
means
hoarding
up
you
not
obliged
to
take
it
i
do
this
year
i
got
harmony
down
on
my
instead
you
miss
the
rambles
with
teddie
i
do
care
i
play
instead
how
about
the
blackberry
foray
oh
i
not
going
to
be
left
out
of
that
it
not
specially
nature
study
i
put
my
name
down
with
miss
moseley
party
the
inmates
of
the
woodlands
were
fond
of
jam
it
was
supplied
to
them
liberally
and
they
consumed
large
quantities
of
it
at
to
help
to
meet
this
demand
blackberrying
expeditions
were
organized
during
the
last
weeks
of
september
and
the
whole
school
turned
out
in
relays
to
pick
fruit
a
dozen
girls
and
a
mistress
generally
composed
a
party
which
was
not
confined
to
any
particular
form
but
might
include
any
whose
arrangements
for
practising
or
special
lessons
allowed
them
to
go
dates
and
particulars
of
the
various
rambles
planned
with
the
names
of
the
mistresses
who
were
to
be
leaders
were
pinned
up
on
the
and
the
girls
might
put
their
names
to
them
as
they
liked
so
long
as
each
list
did
not
exceed
twelve
on
saturday
afternoon
miss
moseley
headed
a
foray
in
the
direction
of
porth
powys
falls
and
merle
ulyth
rona
addie
and
stephanie
were
members
of
her
flock
i
glad
i
managed
to
get
into
this
party
announced
merle
because
i
always
like
porth
powys
better
than
pontvoelas
or
aberceiriog
it
a
jollier
walk
and
the
blackberries
are
bigger
and
better
i
was
the
very
last
on
the
list
so
i
luck
alice
had
to
go
under
teddie
wing
rather
have
mosie
than
teddie
so
would
i
agreed
ulyth
i
scribbled
my
name
the
very
first
of
all
just
got
a
chance
to
do
it
as
i
was
going
to
my
before
everyone
else
made
a
rush
for
the
board
porth
powys
will
be
looking
no
end
swinging
their
baskets
the
girls
began
to
climb
a
narrow
path
which
ran
alongside
the
stream
up
the
glen
some
of
them
were
tempted
to
linger
and
began
to
gather
what
blackberries
could
be
found
but
miss
moseley
had
different
plans
come
along
it
ridiculous
to
waste
our
labour
here
she
exclaimed
all
these
bushes
have
been
well
picked
over
already
we
walk
straight
on
till
we
come
to
the
lane
near
the
ruined
cottage
then
we
shall
get
a
harvest
and
fill
our
baskets
in
a
third
of
the
time
quick
march
there
was
sense
in
her
remarks
so
merle
abandoned
several
specimens
for
which
she
had
been
reaching
and
joined
the
file
that
was
winding
indian
fashion
up
the
path
through
the
wood
over
a
high
stile
they
climbed
then
dropped
down
into
the
gorge
to
where
a
small
wooden
bridge
spanned
the
stream
they
loved
to
stand
here
looking
at
the
brown
rushing
water
that
swirled
below
the
thick
trees
made
a
green
parlour
and
the
continual
moisture
had
carpeted
the
woods
with
beautiful
verdant
moss
which
grew
in
close
sheets
over
the
rocks
up
again
by
an
even
steeper
and
craggier
track
they
climbed
the
farther
bank
of
the
gorge
and
came
out
at
last
on
to
the
broad
that
overlooked
the
craigwen
valley
here
was
scope
for
a
leader
the
track
was
so
overgrown
as
to
be
almost
indistinguishable
and
ran
across
boggy
land
where
it
was
only
too
easy
to
plunge
over
one
in
oozy
peat
miss
moseley
found
the
way
like
a
pioneer
she
had
often
been
there
before
and
remembered
just
what
places
were
treacherous
and
just
where
it
was
possible
to
use
a
swinging
bough
for
a
help
by
following
in
her
footsteps
the
party
got
safely
over
without
serious
wettings
and
sat
down
to
take
breath
for
a
few
minutes
on
some
smooth
rocks
that
topped
the
ridge
they
had
been
scaling
they
were
now
at
some
height
above
the
valley
and
the
prospect
was
magnificent
for
at
least
ten
miles
they
could
trace
the
windings
of
the
river
and
taller
and
more
distant
mountain
peaks
had
come
into
view
some
people
say
that
craigwen
valley
very
like
the
rhine
volunteered
ulyth
it
has
any
castles
of
course
except
at
llangarmon
but
the
scenery
just
as
lovely
nice
to
think
it
british
then
rejoiced
merle
wales
can
hold
its
own
in
the
way
of
mountains
and
lakes

have
no
need
to
go
abroad
for
them
what
new

there
replied
the
cuckoo
bigger
than
this
by
lots
and
with
up
in
the
bush
this
is
bad
though
as
far
as
it
goes
what
that
place
over
across
on
the
opposite
hill
where
the
light
shining
oh
that
llanfairgwyn
there
a
village
and
a
church
we
only
been
once
it
rather
a
long
way
because
you
have
to
cross
the
ferry
at
glanafon
before
you
can
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
what
that
big
white
house
in
the
trees
with
the
flag
that
plas
cafn

in
the
neighbourhood
you
know
said
stephanie
fondly
fingering
her
necklace
i
do
know
how
should
i
well
you
know
it
now
at
any
rate
does
it
belong
to
toffs
it
belongs
to
lord
and
lady
glyncraig
they
live
there
for
part
of
the
year
oh
said
rona
she
put
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
surveyed
the
distant
mansion
for
several
moments
in
silence
i
reckon
they
stuck
up
she
remarked
at
last
i
believe
they
considered
nice
i
never
spoken
to
them
replied
ulyth
i
have
put
in
stephanie
complacently
i
went
to
tea
once
at
plas
cafn
it
was
when
father
was
member
for
rotherford
lord
glyncraig
knew
him
in
parliament
of
course
and
he
happened
to
meet
father
and
me
just
when
we
were
walking
past
the
gate
at
plas
cafn
and
asked
us
in
to
tea
merle
addie
and
ulyth
smiled
this
visit
paid
four
years
ago
was
the
standing
triumph
of
stephanie
life
she
never
forgot
nor
allowed
any
of
her
schoolfellows
to
forget
that
she
had
been
entertained
by
the
great
people
of
the
neighbourhood
he
was
lord
glyncraig
then
he
was
only
sir
john
mitchell
baronet
he
been
raised
to
a
peerage
since
said
merle
willing
to
qualify
some
of
the
glory
of
stephanie
reminiscences
we
do
grow
peers
in
waitoto
or
baronets
either
for
the
matter
of
that
observed
rona
i
do
guess
they
wanted
out
with
us
have
no
place
in
the
bush
for
a
lord
glyncraig
you
better
claim
acquaintance
with
him
as
your
name
mitchell
too
how
proud
he
be
of
the
honour
teased
addie
coral
flooded
the
whole
of
the
cuckoo
face
she
had
begun
to
understand
the
difference
between
her
rough
upbringing
and
the
refined
homes
of
the
other
girls
and
she
resented
the
sneers
that
were
often
made
at
her
expense
our
butcher
at
home
is
joseph
mitchell
hinnied
merle
mitchell
a
common
enough
name
said
ulyth
i
know
two
families
in
scotland
and
some
people
at
plymouth
all
called
mitchell
they
none
of
them
related
to
each
other
and
probably
not
to
merle
butcher
or
to
lord
glyncraig
nor
to
me
said
rona
i
a
democrat
and
i
glory
in
it
welcome
to
her
grand
friends
if
she
likes
them
i
do
like
them
sighed
stephanie
plaintively
i
love
aristocratic
people
and
nice
houses
and
things
why
should
i
you
need
grin
addie
knighton
you
know
them
yourself
if
you
could
when
i
come
out
i
like
to
be
presented
at
court
and
go
to
a
ball
where
the
people
are
all
dukes
and
duchesses
and
earls
and
countesses
it
would
be
worth
while
dancing
with
a
duke
especially
if
he
wore
the
order
of
the
garter
until
that
glorious
day
comes
you
have
to
dance
with
poor
little
me
for
a
partner
giggled
merle
are
you
all
rested
we
shall
get
no
blackberries
if
we
do
hurry
on
called
miss
moseley
from
the
other
end
of
the
rock
everybody
scrambled
up
immediately
and
set
out
again
over
the
another
and
they
had
reached
the
bourne
of
their
expedition
the
narrow
track
through
the
gorse
and
fern
widened
suddenly
into
a
lane
a
lane
with
very
high
unmortared
walls
over
which
grew
a
variety
of
bramble
with
a
particularly
luscious
fruit
every
connoisseur
of
blackberries
knows
what
a
difference
there
is
between
the
little
hard
seedy
ones
that
commonly
flourish
in
the
hedges
and
the
big
juicy
ones
with
the
larger
leaves
nature
had
been
prodigal
here
and
a
bounteous
harvest
hung
within
easy
reach
they
are
as
big
as
mulberries
and
oh
such
heaps
and
heaps
exclaimed
addie
ecstatically
no
merle
you
wretch
this
is
my
branch
poach
you
wretch
go
farther
on
ca
you
i
wish
we
could
send
the
jam
to
the
hospital
when
it
made
sighed
merle
the
party
spread
itself
out
some
of
the
girls
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
wall
so
that
they
could
reach
what
grew
on
the
sunnier
side
and
a
few
skirted
round
over
a
gate
into
a
field
where
a
ruined
cottage
was
also
covered
with
brambles
they
worked
down
the
lane
by
slow
degrees
picking
hard
as
they
went
at
the
end
a
sudden
rushing
roar
struck
upon
the
ear
and
without
even
waiting
for
a
signal
from
miss
moseley
the
girls
with
one
accord
hopped
over
a
fence
and
ran
up
a
slight
incline
the
voice
of
the
waterfall
was
calling
and
the
impulse
to
obey
was
irresistible
at
the
top
of
the
slope
they
stopped
for
they
had
reached
a
natural
platform
that
overlooked
the
gorge
the
scene
rivalled
one
of
the
of
switzerland
the
porth
powys
stream
flowing
between
precipitous
rocks
fell
two
hundred
feet
in
a
series
of
four
splendid
cascades
the
rugged
crags
on
either
side
were
thickly
covered
with
a
forest
of
fir
and
larch
and
here
and
there
a
taller
reared
its
darker
head
above
the
silvery
green
dashing
roaring
leaping
shouting
the
water
poured
down
in
a
volume
the
white
spray
rose
up
in
clouds
wetting
the
girls
faces
the
sound
was
like
an
endless
chorus
of
hallelujahs
porth
powys
is
in
fine
form
there
must
have
been
rain
up
in
the
mountains
last
night
remarked
ulyth
what
do
you
think
of
it
rona
it
a
champion
i
going
to
climb
down
there
and
get
at
the
edge
no
you
wo
said
miss
moseley
sharply
nobody
is
to
go
a
single
step
nearer
you
must
all
come
back
into
the
lane
now
and
get
on
with
your
baskets
are
only
half
full
yet
very
reluctantly
the
girls
followed
the
fall
exercised
a
fascination
over
them
and
they
could
have
stayed
half
an
hour
watching
its
white
swirl
they
did
not
wish
however
to
earn
the
reputation
of
slackers
two
other
parties
had
gone
out
blackberrying
that
afternoon
and
there
would
be
keen
competition
as
to
which
would
bring
back
the
most
pounds
they
set
to
work
again
therefore
with
enthusiasm
counting
stained
fingers
and
scratches
as
glorious
wounds
earned
in
the
good
cause
rona
picked
with
zeal
but
she
had
a
preoccupied
look
on
her
face
say
i
liked
that
waterfall
she
remarked
to
ulyth
one
ca
see
anything
of
it
down
in
this
old
lane
i
going
to
get
a
better
view
you
must
go
off
on
your
own
commanded
ulyth
miss
moseley
will
report
you
if
you
do
do
excite
yourself
i
only
said
i
was
going
to
get
a
better
view
it
quite
easy
rona
put
her
basket
in
a
safe
place
and
with
the
aid
of
a
hazel
bush
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
wall
apparently
the
prospect
did
not
satisfy
her
i
going
a
stave
higher
still
keep
your
hair
on
she
shouted
down
to
ulyth
and
began
swarming
up
the
bole
of
a
huge
old
that
abutted
on
the
wall
she
was
strong
and
active
as
a
boy
and
had
soon
scrambled
to
where
the
branches
forked
a
mass
of
twisted
ivy
hung
here
and
raising
herself
with
its
aid
she
stood
on
an
outstretched
bough
it
ripping
i
can
see
a
little
bit
of
the
fall
i
see
it
better
if
i
get
over
on
to
that
other
branch
take
care
called
miss
moseley
from
below
rona
started
she
had
not
known
the
mistress
was
so
near
the
movement
upset
her
decidedly
unstable
balance
she
clutched
hard
at
the
ivy
but
it
gave
way
in
her
fingers
there
was
a
sudden
crash
and
a
smothered
shriek
white
as
a
ghost
miss
moseley
climbed
the
wall
expecting
to
find
the
prostrate
form
of
her
pupil
on
the
other
side
to
her
surprise
she
saw
nothing
of
the
sort
near
at
hand
however
came
a
stifled
groan
rona
where
are
you
shrieked
the
distracted
governess
here
spluttered
the
voice
of
the
cuckoo
inside
the
tree
the
beastly
old
thing
rotten
and
i
tumbled
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
trunk
are
you
hurt
no
nothing
to
speak
of
here
a
pretty
go
murmured
the
girls
who
all
came
running
at
the
sound
of
shouts
how
she
going
to
get
out
again
ca
you
climb
up
urged
miss
moseley
no
i
ca
stir
an
inch
i
wedged
in
somehow
what
was
to
be
done
the
affair
waxed
serious
miss
moseley
with
a
really
heroic
effort
and
much
help
from
the
girls
managed
to
scale
the
tree
and
look
down
into
the
hollow
trunk
she
could
just
see
scared
face
peeping
up
at
her
many
feet
below
can
you
put
up
your
hand
and
let
me
pull
you
no
i
tell
you
i
wedged
as
tight
as
a
sardine
we
shall
have
to
send
for
help
then
may
and
kathleen
run
as
quickly
as
you
can
down
the
lane
there
a
farm
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
tell
them
what
the
matter
i
hope
to
goodness
they
understand
english
murmured
merle
will
i
have
to
stop
here
always
demanded
a
tragic
voice
within
the
tree
shall
you
be
able
to
feed
me
or
will
i
have
to
starve
how
long
does
it
take
to
die
of
hunger

wo
die
just
yet
returned
miss
moseley
laughing
a
little
in
spite
of
herself
we
get
you
out
in
course
of
time
i
guess
i
better
make
my
will
though

pencil
and
paper
and
will
they
please

and

and
amabel

my
old

ulyth
can
take
what
i
got
at
school
be
any
great
shakes
to
her
i
expect
you
did
tell
me
how
long
it
takes
to
die
cheer
up
there
not
the
slightest
danger
miss
moseley
continued
to
assure
her
it
all
very
well
to
say
up
when
you
standing
safe
on
the
top
said
the
gloomy
voice
of
the
imprisoned
dryad
it
feels
a
different
matter
when
you
boxed
up
tight
with
tree
all
round
you
it
jolly
uncomfortable
where
are
the
girls
here
one
replied
ulyth
climbing
the
tree
to
relieve
poor
miss
moseley
who
gladly
retired
in
her
favour
i
going
to
stay
and
talk
to
you
till
somebody
comes
to
get
you
out
oh
here
are
may
and
kathleen
at
last
what
a
fearful
time
they
been
the
two
messengers
came
panting
back
with
many
excuses
for
their
delay
it
was
a
long
way
down
the
lane
to
the
farm
and
when
they
arrived
there
they
had
considerable
difficulty
in
explaining
their
errand
no
one
could
understand
english
except
a
little
boy
who
was
only
to
translate
their
remarks
into
welsh
they
had
at
length
made
the
farmer
realize
what
had
happened
and
he
had
promised
to
come
at
once
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
they
were
followed
by
david
jones
and
his
son
idwal
bearing
a
rope
an
axe
and
a
saw
and
looking
rather
dismayed
at
the
task
in
store
for
them
it
proved
indeed
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
to
rescue
rona
without
hurting
her
a
portion
of
the
was
obliged
to
be
sawn
away
before
she
could
obtain
sufficient
room
to
help
to
free
herself
and
it
was
only
after
an
hard
work
that
she
stood
at
last
in
safety
on
the
ground
how
do
you
feel
asked
miss
moseley
anxiously
fearing
broken
bones
or
a
sprain
from
the
final
effort
of
extraction
well
i
guess
it
taken
the
bounce
out
of
me
i
as
stiff
as
a
rheumatic
cat
oh
i
get
back
to
school
somehow
do
alarm
yourself
i
absolutely
starving
for
tea
you
you
nearly
finished
me
and
rona
shook
her
fist
at
the
offending
as
a
parting
salute
she
called
it
demon
to
rhyme
with
lemon
gurgled
addie
almost
sobbing
with
mirth
as
she
followed
holding
merle
arm
the
cuckoo
will
cause
me
to
break
a
some
day
it
hurts
me
most
dreadfully
to
laugh
i
got
a
stitch
in
my
side
oh
dear
i
wonder
whatever
go
and
do
next
chapter
v
on
sufferance
scratch
scratch
scratch
scratch
went
the
old
black
hen
every
fowl
that
scrapes
in
the
barn
can
scratch
as
well
as
your
pen
so
sang
rona
bounding
noisily
one
afternoon
into
no
room
and
popping
her
hands
from
behind
over
ulyth
eyes
as
the
latter
sat
writing
at
a
table
near
the
window
what
are
you
always
scratching
away
for
ca
you
finish
your
work
at
why
do
you
come
downstairs
and
play
you
mighty
studious
all
of
a
sudden
what
have
you
got
here
ulyth
flushed
crimson
with
annoyance
and
turned
her
sheets
of
foolscap
hastily
over
to
hide
them
from
her
prying
eyes
you
not
to
touch
my
papers
rona
i
told
you
that
before
well
i
was
touching
them
looking
not
touching
anyway
what
are
you
doing
it
queer
taste
to
sit
scribbling
here
half
your
spare
time
what
i
was
doing
is
my
own
concern
and
no
business
of
yours
now
you
riled
said
the
cuckoo
sitting
down
easily
on
her
bed
i
did
mean
any
harm
i
always
seem
sticking
my
foot
into
it
somehow
ulyth
sighed
nobody
in
the
school
realized
how
much
she
had
to
put
up
with
from
her
irrepressible
whose
hearty
voice
extraordinary
expressions
and
broad
notions
of
fun
grated
upon
her
sensitive
nature
rona
did
not
appreciate
in
the
least
the
heroic
sacrifice
that
ulyth
was
making
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
be
placed
in
another
dormitory
and
that
she
only
remained
on
sufferance
in
no
she
admired
ulyth
immensely
and
was
quite
prepared
to
take
her
as
a
model
but
at
present
the
copy
was
very
far
indeed
from
the
original
the
mistresses
had
instituted
a
vigorous
crusade
against
rona
loud
voice
and
unconventional
english
and
she
was
really
making
an
effort
to
improve
but
the
habits
of
years
are
not
effaced
in
a
few
weeks
and
she
still
scandalized
the
authorities
considerably
ulyth
could
tolerate
her
when
she
kept
to
her
own
side
of
the
bedroom
but
to
have
meddlesome
fingers
interfering
with
her
private
possessions
was
the
last
straw
to
her
burden
of
endurance
do
you
understand
she
repeated
emphatically
you
not
to
touch
my
papers
at
all
all
serene
i
wo
lay
a
finger
on
them
honest
sure
returned
the
cuckoo
chanting
her
words
to
the
air
of
swanee
river
and
drumming
an
accompaniment
on
the
bedpost
what
think
stephanie
called
me
just
now
she
said
i
was
an
unlicked
cub
oh
surely
she
did
are
you
certain
heard
her
myself
she
said
it
to
my
face
and
tittered
you
bet
i
pay
her
out
somehow
miss
stephanie
radford
needs
taking
down
a
peg
oh
do
alarm
yourself
i
do
it
neatly
there
be
no
clumsy
bungling
about
it
well
if
you
wo
go
down
and
play
i
shall
more
fun
than
sitting
up
here
as
the
door
banged
behind
rona
ulyth
heaved
an
ecstatic
thank
goodness
she
sat
for
a
few
moments
trying
to
regain
her
composure
before
she
recommenced
the
writing
at
which
she
had
been
interrupted
the
manuscript
on
which
she
was
engaged
was
very
precious
she
had
set
herself
no
less
a
task
than
to
write
a
book
the
subject
had
come
to
her
suddenly
one
morning
as
she
lay
awake
in
bed
and
she
regarded
it
as
an
inspiration
she
would
make
a
story
about
the
woodlands
and
bring
in
all
the
girls
she
knew
it
was
no
use
struggling
with
a
historical
plot
or
a
romance
of
the
war
she
had
tried
these
and
stuck
fast
in
the
first
chapters
it
was
better
to
employ
the
material
close
at
hand
and
weave
her
tale
from
the
incidents
which
happened
in
the
school
so
she
had
begun
and
though
she
floundered
a
little
at
the
difficulty
of
transferring
her
impressions
to
paper
she
was
making
distinct
progress
i
never
dare
to
have
it
published
of
course
she
ruminated
still
it
a
beginning
and
i
shall
like
to
read
it
over
to
myself
i
think
there
are
some
rather
neat
bits
in
it
especially
that
shot
at
addie
and
stephie
how
wild
they
be
if
they
knew
but
there
no
fear
of
that
i
take
good
care
nobody
finds
out
when
to
make
time
to
go
on
with
her
literary
composition
was
the
difficulty
it
was
hard
to
snatch
even
an
occasional
during
the
day
where
there
is
a
will
however
there
is
generally
also
a
way
and
ulyth
hit
upon
the
plan
of
getting
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
writing
while
rona
was
still
asleep
the
cuckoo
never
stirred
until
the
seven
bell
rang
when
she
would
awake
noisily
with
many
yawns
and
stretchings
of
arms
so
ulyth
flattered
herself
that
her
secret
was
absolutely
safe
where
to
hide
the
precious
papers
was
another
problem
she
did
not
dare
to
put
them
in
any
of
her
drawers
her
desk
would
not
lock
and
her
little
was
too
small
to
contain
them
the
fireplace
in
the
bedroom
had
an
that
was
fitted
with
a
loose
wooden
from
which
hung
a
border
of
needlework
it
was
quite
easy
to
lift
up
this
board
and
slip
the
papers
between
it
and
the
the
border
completely
screened
the
and
except
at
a
the
arrangement
was
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
ulyth
congratulated
herself
greatly
upon
her
ingenuity
it
was
interesting
to
have
a
secret
which
nobody
even
guessed
she
often
looked
at
the
and
chuckled
as
she
thought
of
what
lay
concealed
there
the
days
were
rapidly
closing
in
now
and
the
time
between
tea
and
preparation
which
only
a
few
weeks
ago
was
devoted
to
a
last
game
of
tennis
or
a
run
by
the
stream
was
perforce
spent
by
the
schoolroom
fire
it
was
only
a
short
interval
not
long
enough
to
make
any
elaborate
occupation
worth
while
so
the
girls
sat
knitting
in
the
twilight
and
chatting
until
the
bell
rang
for
evening
work
one
afternoon
when
tea
was
finished
ulyth
instead
of
joining
the
others
as
usual
walked
upstairs
to
put
away
some
specimens
in
the
museum
she
passed
v
b
classroom
as
she
did
so
and
heard
smothered
peals
of
mirth
issuing
from
behind
the
door
what
are
they
doing
she
thought
i
believe
i
go
and
see
but
catching
rona
laugh
above
the
rest
she
changed
her
mind
walked
on
and
bestowed
her
fossils
carefully
in
a
spare
corner
of
one
of
the
cases
meanwhile
the
group
assembled
round
the
fire
in
v
b
were
enjoying
themselves
the
room
was
growing
dusk
but
seated
on
the
hearthrug
addie
knighton
could
see
quite
sufficiently
to
read
aloud
extracts
from
a
document
she
was
perusing
extracts
to
which
the
others
listened
with
thrilling
interest
interspersed
with
comments
girls
of
the
oaklands
so
she
read
a
rather
peculiar
and
miscellaneous
set
especially
those
in
the
lower
fifth
scarcely
any
of
them
could
be
called
pretty
oh
oh
howled
the
attentive
circle
of
them
valerie
chadford
imagined
herself
so
and
gave
herself
fearful
airs
in
consequence
she
was
very
set
up
at
knowing
smart
people
and
often
bragged
about
it
i
never
forgive
her
never
screamed
stephanie
twins
pearl
and
doris
were
fat
stodgy
girls
who
wore
in
shoes
and
had
waists
oh
wo
merle
and
alice
be
just
frantic
when
they
hear
even
they
were
more
interesting
than
nellie
clacton
who
usually
sat
with
her
mouth
open
as
if
she
was
trying
to
catch
flies
does
she
mean
me
gasped
mary
acton
indignantly
tulliver
was
inclined
to
be
snarly
and
often
said
mean
things
about
other
people
behind
their
backs
i
say
something
now
declared
gertrude
oliver
annie
ryton
was
but
here
addie
broke
off
abruptly
and
exploded
go
on
go
on
commanded
the
girls
it
too
lovely
spluttered
addie
o
ho
ho
so
that
what
she
thinks
of
me
is
it
read
it
ca
you
here
give
the
paper
to
me
no
no
i
go
on
but
i
did
know
my
eyes
were
like
faded
gooseberries
and
my
hair
like
dried
seaweed
has
she
described
herself
asked
stephanie
i
have
come
to
it
yet
oh
yes
here
we
are
farther
on
heroine
morvyth
langton
was
an
unusually
but
here
addie
stopped
abruptly
for
a
blazing
little
fury
stood
in
the
doorway
addie
knighton
how
dare
you
how
dare
you
give
me
that
paper
this
instant
no
no
it
much
too
interesting
let
go
do
be
silly
how
can
you
oh
what
a
shame
as
ulyth
in
her
anger
tore
the
manuscript
across
and
flung
it
into
the
fire
whew
now
you
gone
and
done
it
whistled
rona
ulyth
was
holding
down
the
last
flaming
fragment
with
the
poker
when
it
had
expired
she
turned
to
the
guilty
circle
who
took
my
papers
from
my
bedroom
her
voice
was
sharp
and
her
eyes
fixed
full
on
rona
i
did
touch
them
i
never
laid
so
much
as
a
finger
on
them
protested
the
cuckoo
but
you
told
someone
where
they
were
rona
winked
in
reply
yes
alas
winked
consciously
and
deliberately
it
was
well
for
her
that
miss
moseley
was
not
in
the
room
i
knew
you
got
something
there
she
admitted
were
you
such
an
innocent
as
to
think
i
never
saw
you
scribbling
away
hard
in
the
early
mornings
why
i
was
foxing
i
used
to
watch
you
while
i
was
snoring
and
nearly
died
with
laughing
because
you
never
found
me
out
if
eyes
could
slay
ulyth
would
have
finished
rona
at
that
moment
but
addie
knighton
whose
suspension
of
mirth
had
been
merely
a
species
of
temporary
paralysis
now
relapsed
into
a
choking
series
of
guffaws
in
which
the
others
joined
boisterously
i
ca
get
over
seaweed
and
faded
gooseberries
crowed
addie
hysterically
i
do
catch
flies
with
my
open
mouth
shouted
mary
acton
suspending
her
knitting
in
her
indignation
will
somebody
please
measure
the
twins
waists
bleated
christine
i
did
say
it
was
meant
for
any
of
you
if
the
cap
fits
put
it
on
listeners
hear
no
good
of
themselves
and
no
more
do
people
who
read
what
is
intended
for
them
it
serves
you
all
right
so
there
and
ulyth
flounced
out
of
the
room
she
ran
straight
up
to
her
bedroom
and
burst
into
tears
it
was
such
a
ending
to
her
literary
ambition
she
would
rather
the
girls
had
been
more
indignant
than
that
they
had
laughed
so
much
i
never
write
another
line
again
she
resolved
and
then
she
thought
of
the
binding
she
had
always
intended
to
have
on
her
first
published
book
and
wept
harder
ulyth
said
the
cuckoo
stealing
in
rather
shamefacedly
i
really
frightfully
sorry
if
you
riled
i
did
know
you
cared
all
that
much
about
those
old
papers
i
told
addie
as
a
joke
and
she
went
and
poked
them
out
i
think
they
were
fine
it
was
a
shame
to
burn
them
ca
you
write
them
over
again
never
ulyth
replied
wiping
her
eyes
rona
you
do
realize
what
damage
you
done
there
oh
yes
i
forgive
you
but
if
you
want
to
keep
friends
with
me
do
go
and
do
anything
of
the
sort
again
all
ulyth
felt
a
little
shy
of
meeting
her
after
their
discovery
of
the
very
unflattering
description
she
had
written
of
them
but
the
girls
were
and
did
not
bear
malice
they
treated
the
whole
affair
as
an
intense
joke
and
even
took
to
calling
one
another
by
the
assumed
names
of
the
story
they
composed
extra
portions
including
a
lurid
description
of
ulyth
herself
illustrated
by
rapid
sketches
on
the
the
disappointed
authoress
took
it
with
what
calm
she
could
muster
she
knew
they
meant
to
tease
and
the
fewer
sparks
they
could
raise
from
her
the
sooner
they
would
desist
and
let
the
matter
drop
it
would
probably
serve
as
a
target
for
addie
wit
till
the
end
of
the
term
unless
the
excitement
of
the
newly
formed
ambulance
class
chased
it
from
her
memory
the
woodlanders
were
trying
to
do
their
duty
by
their
country
and
all
the
girls
were
enthusiastically
practising
bandaging
i
wish
we
some
real
patients
to
bind
up
sighed
merle
one
day
as
v
b
took
its
turn
under
nurse
griffith
instructions
i
be
sorry
for
them
if
they
were
left
to
your
tender
mercies
retorted
mavis
who
had
been
posing
as
patient
my
arm
sore
yet
with
your
vigorous
measures
what
nonsense
i
was
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
a
curious
variety
of
lamb
then
with
a
wolf
inside
i
believe
the
woodlands
would
make
a
gorgeous
hospital
suggested
addie
hopefully
when
we
through
our
course
we
might
have
some
real
patients
down
and
nurse
them
do
you
think
it
the
rainbow
wo
carry
ambulance
lessons
as
far
as
that
chapter
vi
quits
ulyth
brushing
her
hair
before
the
one
morning
hummed
cheerily
you
seem
in
spirits
commented
rona
from
the
washstand
it
more
than
i
am
miss
lodge
was
a
pig
yesterday
she
said
my
dictation
was
a
disgrace
to
the
school
and
i
got
to
stop
in
during
the
interval
this
morning
and
write
out
all
the
wrong
words
a
dozen
times
each
it
too
sickening
i
no
luck
yesterday
phyllis
chantrey
had
my
book
to
correct
and
her
writing
and
mine
are
such
opposite
poles
we
try
it
on
try
what
on
asked
ulyth
pausing
with
the
brush
in
her
hand
why
the
exchange
dodge
you
know
i
do
know
do
you
take
dictation
in
v
b
well
in
our
form
we
get
it
twice
a
week
and
miss
lodge
makes
us
correct
each
other
books
we
make
it
up
to
try
and
exchange
with
a
girl
whose
writing
pretty
like
one
own
then
you
see
we
can
alter
things
neatly
and
allow
full
marks
it
generally
works
but
it
did
yesterday
ulyth
face
was
a
study
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
correct
each
other
mistakes
why
not
said
rona
not
the
least
abashed
miss
lodge
never
finds
out
ulyth
collapsed
into
a
chair
what
was
she
to
do
with
such
a
girl
do
you
know
it
the
most
atrocious
cheating
is
it
why
the
whole
form
does
it
returned
the
cuckoo
unconcernedly
then
they
abominable
little
wretches
and
do
deserve
to
be
candidates
for
the
league
i
thoroughly
ashamed
of
them
have
they
no
sense
of
honour
the
cuckoo
was
looking
perplexed
ulyth
stanton
you
always
rounding
something
new
on
me
she
sighed
i
ca
keep
up
with
you
i
keep
my
hair
tidy
now
and
do
leave
my
things
lying
round
the
room
and
i
try
to
give
a
sort
of
twitter
instead
of
laughing
and
i
dropped
ever
so
many
words
you
object
to
and
practise
walking
down
the
passage
with
a
book
on
my
head
what
more
do
you
want
a
great
deal
said
ulyth
gravely
did
you
learn
honour
at
home
catch
mrs
barker
but
surely
your
father
i
saw
so
little
of
dad
he
was
out
all
day
and
sometimes
off
for
weeks
together
at
our
other
block
when
he
was
at
home
he
did
care
to
be
bothered
overmuch
an
amazed
pity
was
taking
the
place
of
ulyth
indignation
this
was
indeed
fallow
ground
arnold
comment
flashed
across
her
mind
what
an
opportunity
for
a
i
do
want
to
be
turned
into
a
prig
urged
the
cuckoo
you
need
there
a
certain
amount
of
slang
and
fun
allowable
but
must
always
come
first
you
understand
french
yet
well
never
mind
all
that
matters
is
that
you
simply
must
realize
rona
do
listen
please
that
all
of
us
here
including
you
must
could
cheat
at
lessons
for
your
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
school
you
must
stop
it
you
think
a
lot
of
the
school
and
quite
right
too
the
school
stands
to
us
for
what
the
state
does
to
people
we
got
to
do
our
best
to
keep
the
tone
up
cheating
brings
it
down
with
a
run
it
as
bad
as
tearing
up
treaties
go
ahead
rub
it
in
returned
the
cuckoo
beginning
to
whistle
a
trifle
defiantly
she
thought
the
matter
over
nevertheless
and
returned
to
the
subject
that
night
when
they
were
going
to
bed
ulyth
i
told
the
girls
exactly
what
you
said
about
them
my
gracious
you
should
have
seen
their
faces
boiled
lobsters
were
in
it
that
hit
about
the
guild
seemed
specially
to
floor
them
i
fancy
somehow
there
be
any
more
correcting
done
in
dictation
you
touched
them
up
no
end
i
extremely
glad
if
what
i
said
has
brought
them
to
their
senses
declared
ulyth
rona
got
on
tolerably
well
among
her
comrades
but
there
was
one
exception
with
stephanie
she
was
generally
in
a
state
of
guerrilla
warfare
the
latter
declared
that
the
vulgar
addition
to
the
school
was
an
outrage
on
the
feelings
of
those
who
had
been
better
brought
up
stephanie
had
ambitions
towards
society
with
a
big
s
and
worshipped
titles
she
would
have
liked
the
daughter
of
a
duke
for
a
schoolfellow
but
so
far
no
member
of
the
aristocracy
had
condescended
to
come
and
be
educated
at
the
woodlands
stephanie
felt
injured
that
miss
bowes
and
miss
teddington
should
have
accepted
such
a
girl
as
rona
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
showing
that
she
thought
the
new
zealander
very
far
below
the
accepted
standard
the
cuckoo
undoubted
good
looks
were
perhaps
another
point
in
her
disfavour
the
school
beauty
did
not
easily
yield
place
to
a
rival
and
though
she
professed
to
consider
rona
complexion
too
she
had
a
sneaking
consciousness
that
it
was
superior
to
her
own
during
the
summer
holidays
stephanie
had
taken
part
in
a
pageant
that
was
held
in
aid
of
a
charity
near
her
home
as
queen
of
the
roses
she
had
occupied
a
rather
important
position
and
her
portrait
in
her
beautiful
fancy
costume
had
appeared
in
several
of
the
leading
newspapers
stephanie
features
were
good
and
the
photograph
had
been
a
very
happy
one
glorified
out
of
all
knowledge
said
some
of
the
girls
so
the
photographer
had
exhibited
it
in
his
window
and
altogether
more
notice
had
been
taken
of
it
than
was
perhaps
salutary
for
the
original
stephanie
had
brought
a
copy
back
to
school
and
it
now
adorned
her
bedroom
mantelpiece
she
was
never
tired
of
descanting
upon
the
pageant
and
telling
about
all
the
aristocratic
people
who
had
come
to
see
it
according
to
her
account
the
very
flower
of
the
neighbourhood
had
been
present
and
had
taken
special
notice
of
her
a
girl
who
had
so
lately
consorted
with
the
county
could
not
be
expected
to
tolerate
a
tyro
from
the
backwoods
stephanie
was
too
well
brought
up
to
allow
herself
to
be
often
openly
rude
her
taunts
were
generally
ingeniously
veiled
but
they
were
none
the
less
aggravating
for
that
the
cuckoo
might
be
callow
in
some
respects
but
in
others
she
was
very
much
though
she
would
look
obtuse
and
pretend
not
to
understand
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
a
gibe
was
lost
upon
her
and
she
kept
an
exact
account
of
the
score
one
morning
early
in
december
miss
teddington
who
was
distributing
the
contents
of
the
postbag
handed
stephanie
a
small
parcel
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
the
latter
birthday
and
supposing
it
to
be
a
belated
present
the
mistress
did
not
ask
the
usual
questions
by
which
she
regulated
her
pupils
correspondence
the
letters
were
always
given
out
immediately
after
breakfast
and
the
girls
took
them
upstairs
to
read
in
their
dormitories
during
the
quarter
of
an
hour
in
which
they
made
their
beds
and
tidied
their
rooms
this
morning
just
as
ulyth
was
shaking
her
pillow
rona
came
in
chuckling
to
herself
the
eyes
twinkled
like
stars
want
some
sport
she
asked
if
you
do
come
with
me
and
have
the
time
of
your
life
ulyth
put
down
the
pillow
and
hesitated
fifteen
minutes
was
not
too
long
an
allowance
for
all
she
was
expected
to
do
in
her
room
but
manner
was
inviting
she
wanted
to
see
what
the
fun
was
the
temptress
held
the
door
open
and
beckoned
beguilingly
all
serene
yielded
ulyth
rona
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
dragged
her
delightedly
down
the
passage
now
you
chummy
she
murmured
whatever
you
do
though
do
make
a
noise
and
give
the
show
away
still
in
the
dark
as
to
the
cuckoo
intentions
ulyth
allowed
herself
to
be
led
to
dormitory
no
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
we
have
mentioned
before
that
the
bedrooms
at
the
woodlands
were
very
spacious
so
large
indeed
that
each
was
partitioned
into
four
cubicles
divided
by
walls
a
passage
inside
the
dormitory
gave
access
to
the
cubicles
which
were
in
fact
separate
little
bedrooms
except
that
the
partition
walls
for
purposes
of
ventilation
did
not
reach
the
ceiling
at
present
the
fourth
cubicle
in
dormitory
was
unoccupied
but
its
furniture
was
rather
curiously
arranged
one
of
the
beds
had
been
pulled
close
against
the
partition
and
a
chest
of
drawers
with
the
drawers
removed
had
been
placed
upon
it
i
fixed
it
up
last
night
and
it
was
a
job
whispered
the
cuckoo
good
thing
i
strong
now
we
got
to
climb
on
that
and
you
see
what
you
see
ulyth
had
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
she
ought
not
to
be
mixed
up
in
such
a
business
but
after
all
the
girls
often
scrambled
up
and
peeped
into
one
another
cubicles
for
a
joke
so
her
action
would
not
be
without
precedent
she
was
a
very
human
person
and
liked
fun
as
well
as
anybody
with
extreme
caution
she
and
rona
mounted
the
chest
of
drawers
trying
not
to
make
the
slightest
noise
their
eyes
were
just
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
partition
and
they
had
a
good
view
of
the
next
cubicle
the
occupants
stephanie
and
her
beth
broadway
were
far
too
absorbed
to
think
of
looking
up
towards
the
ceiling
their
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
parcel
which
had
arrived
by
the
post
it
contained
a
small
bottle
carefully
packed
in
shavings
and
also
a
typewritten
letter
the
purport
of
which
seemed
to
electrify
stephanie
it
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
ever
heard
she
was
saying
beth
just
listen
to
this
and
she
read
aloud
holborn
viaduct
london
dear
madam
having
seen
your
portrait
as
a
noted
beauty
published
in
ladies
court
and
other
leading
pictorials
we
venture
to
submit
to
you
a
sample
of
our
famous
eau
de
venus
an
invaluable
adjunct
to
the
toilet
of
any
lady
possessing
a
delicate
complexion
it
is
a
perfectly
harmless
fragrantly
scented
fluid
which
if
applied
daily
after
breakfast
produces
a
bloom
which
is
absolutely
incomparable
as
it
is
a
new
preparation
we
are
anxious
to
submit
it
to
a
few
ladies
of
influence
in
the
fashionable
world
feeling
sure
that
once
used
they
will
recommend
it
we
shall
esteem
it
a
great
favour
if
you
will
graciously
try
the
enclosed
sample
we
do
not
ask
for
testimonials
but
any
expression
of
appreciation
from
one
who
figured
so
admirably
as
queen
of
the
roses
at
the
barrfield
pageant
would
be
to
us
a
source
of
immense
gratification
may
we
recommend
that
the
preparation
be
applied
immediately
after
breakfast
as
its
ingredients
are
more
potent
to
the
delicate
pores
of
the
skin
if
used
at
that
period
of
the
morning
with
apologies
for
troubling
you
and
hoping
you
will
condescend
to
give
our
eau
de
venus
at
least
a
trial
we
remain
faithfully
yours
renan
mariette
et
cie
parfumeurs
how
very
peculiar
gasped
beth
much
impressed
it
must
be
because
they
saw
my
photo
in
the
papers
said
stephanie
she
was
trying
to
speak
casually
and
not
to
appear
too
flattered
but
her
eyes
shone
i
believe
that
pageant
made
rather
a
sensation
and
of
course
well
i
was
the
principal
figure
in
it
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
try
this
eau
de
venus
it
in
a
funny
little
bottle
commented
beth
samples
generally
are
they
never
send
you
very
much
of
a
thing
they
want
you
to
buy
a
big
bottle
afterwards
stephanie
carefully
removed
the
cork
the
preparation
seemed
to
be
of
a
pink
milky
description
it
smells
of
violets
she
said
offering
the
bottle
for
beth
to
sniff
i
should
certainly
try
it
if
i
were
you
recommended
the
latter
it
says
it
quite
harmless
continued
stephanie
referring
to
the
letter
and
should
be
used
immediately
after
breakfast
well
no
time
like
the
present
if
there
was
a
curious
agitation
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
neither
girl
noticed
it
stephanie
poured
some
of
the
liquid
into
her
hand
and
rubbed
it
over
her
face
then
she
turned
to
the
it
seems
very
pink
and
queer
it
all
in
red
streaks
perhaps
you
put
on
too
much
wipe
some
of
it
off
advised
beth
vigorous
measures
with
a
sponge
followed
and
stephanie
anxiously
surveyed
the
result
it
wo
come
off
she
faltered
oh
what
have
i
done
to
myself
all
red
smears
her
dismay
was
too
much
for
one
at
least
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
rona
broke
into
a
loud
cackling
laugh
one
swift
glance
upwards
and
stephanie
realized
that
she
was
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
it
took
her
exactly
three
seconds
to
reach
the
next
cubicle
so
it
you
is
it
she
exploded
well
ulyth
stanton
i
am
astonished
evil
communications
corrupt
good
manners
and
yours
smack
of
the
backwoods
do
throw
it
on
ulyth
she
knew
nothing
about
it
retorted
the
chuckling
cuckoo
belligerently
it
my
business
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
so
i
might
have
known
you
you
utter
cad
you
do
deserve
to
be
in
a
school
among
ladies
go
on
pitch
it
as
strong
as
you
like
the
cub
quits
with
you
now
for
all
your
airs
and
your
nastiness
oh
do
protested
ulyth
interfering
in
much
distress
rona
do
stop
i
no
idea
you
meant
to
play
such
a
dreadful
trick
on
stephie
you
must
have
known
something
of
it
or
you
would
have
come
to
look
on
i
expect
you
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
sneered
stephanie
so
try
to
sneak
out
of
it
ulyth
stanton
your
precious
joke
has
marked
me
for
life
no
no
it
only
cochineal
and
milk
i
got
it
from
the
cook
put
in
the
cuckoo
it
stained
her
face
all
over
though
said
beth
broadway
reproachfully
i
shall
go
straight
to
miss
bowes
whimpered
stephanie
i
would
do
that
if
i
were
you
said
ulyth
try
some
methylated
spirit
first
i
give
you
some
from
my
room
the
remedy
proved
efficacious
the
stains
yielded
to
gentle
rubbing
and
the
four
girls
flew
in
a
wild
hurry
to
make
their
beds
three
much
relieved
and
one
naughtily
exultant
i
paid
out
stephie
panted
rona
tucking
in
her
blankets
anyhow
i
felt
proud
of
that
letter
made
it
up
with
the
help
of
advertisements
in
the
then
i
typed
it
in
the
study
while
teddie
was
out
you
did
know
i
could
type
learnt
how
on
the
voyage
from
a
girl
who
a
typewriter
on
board
with
her
i
laid
on
the
butter
pretty
thick
i
knew
steph
would
swallow
it
to
any
amount
oh
did
she
just
look
flattered
it
was
prime
the
posted
the
parcel
for
me
stephie
never
forgive
you
much
i
care
chapter
vii
the
cuckoo
progress
your
bear
cub
still
needs
taming
ulyth
said
gertrude
oliver
she
spilt
her
coffee
this
morning
such
a
mess
on
the
tablecloth
i
wish
i
did
sit
next
to
her
i
felt
like
alice
at
the
march
it
was
half
maud
fault
she
jerked
her
elbow
pleaded
ulyth
in
extenuation
oh
you
ca
whitewash
her
so
do
try
i
wo
say
she
is
better
than
when
she
arrived
but
there
room
for
improvement
she
much
slimmer
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
the
voyage
that
had
made
her
grow
so
fat
in
september
i
wish
at
any
rate
you
could
get
her
out
of
using
those
dreadful
backwoods
expressions
it
high
time
she
dropped
them
she
been
here
nearly
a
full
term
ulyth
thought
so
too
and
the
next
time
she
found
a
suitable
opportunity
she
tackled
rona
on
the
subject
you
too
nice
to
speak
in
such
a
queer
way
you
no
idea
how
it
spoils
you
she
urged
you
could
be
another
girl
if
you
only
take
a
little
trouble
what
the
use
who
minds
what
i
like
returned
the
cuckoo
a
trifle
defiantly
i
do
said
ulyth
emphatically
not
really
indeed
i
do
i
care
very
much
you
came
over
here
to
be
my
friend
and
there
are
many
things
i
want
in
a
friend
i
did
know
you
cared
replied
rona
in
a
softened
voice
no
one
ever
did
before
except
dad
when
he
said
i
was
a
savage
do
you
want
to
show
him
what
you
can
grow
into
asked
ulyth
eagerly
think
how
surprised
and
pleased
he
be
when
he
sees
you
again
there
something
in
that
there
a
great
deal
in
it
i
know
i
often
make
myself
do
things
i
do
want
because
of
mother
she
such
a
darling
and
she
stopped
short
realizing
too
late
the
mistake
she
was
making
i
ca
remember
mother
answered
rona
turning
away
with
a
suggestive
cough
it
all
very
well
for
you
ulyth
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
out
she
said
no
more
for
she
knew
her
well
enough
by
this
time
to
have
learnt
that
sympathy
must
be
offered
with
the
utmost
discretion
the
poor
cuckoo
was
only
too
well
aware
of
the
deficiencies
in
her
home
and
upbringing
but
the
least
hint
of
them
from
others
immediately
put
her
on
the
defensive
in
her
own
way
she
was
very
proud
and
though
there
was
a
vast
difference
between
stephanie
stinging
remarks
and
ulyth
kindness
anything
that
savoured
of
compassion
wounded
her
dignity
the
conversation
brought
urgently
to
ulyth
a
question
which
had
been
disturbing
her
and
which
she
had
persistently
tried
to
banish
from
her
thoughts
where
was
rona
going
to
spend
christmas
so
far
as
anyone
knew
she
had
not
a
friend
or
relation
in
the
british
isles
miss
bowes
and
miss
teddington
always
went
away
for
the
holidays
and
the
woodlands
was
left
in
the
charge
of
servants
rona
could
not
stay
at
the
school
surely
had
miss
bowes
made
any
arrangement
for
her
ulyth
vacillated
for
at
least
five
minutes
then
took
out
her
and
began
a
letter
home
motherkins
i
am
such
a
nasty
horrid
selfish
thing
in
every
one
of
your
letters
you
have
hinted
and
hinted
and
hinted
that
we
should
ask
rona
for
christmas
you
would
say
it
outright
until
you
were
sure
i
wanted
it
that
was
just
the
rub
i
did
want
it
i
afraid
even
now
i
quite
i
had
her
all
the
term
and
i
thought
it
would
be
so
blissful
to
be
without
her
for
four
whole
weeks
and
have
you
and
father
and
oswald
and
dorothy
and
peter
just
to
myself
but
oh
motherkins
such
a
lonely
waif
of
a
girl
i
so
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
she
seems
always
out
of
everything
i
sure
she
never
had
a
decent
christmas
in
her
life
i
believe
she
fond
of
her
father
though
i
do
think
he
took
very
much
notice
of
her
she
let
out
once
that
he
was
so
disappointed
she
was
a
boy
but
barker
the
housekeeper
must
have
been
a
most
terrible
person
rona
had
no
chance
at
all
motherkins
she
never
seen
a
real
english
home
and
i
like
to
show
her
ours
yes
i
would
although
in
a
way
she
spoil
everything
may
she
sleep
in
the
spare
room
and
let
me
have
my
own
to
myself
i
could
stand
it
then
dearest
darling
i
really
mean
it
so
will
you
write
straight
off
to
miss
bowes
before
i
have
time
to
turn
thoroughly
horrid
again
your
very
loving
daughter
ulyth
having
sent
off
the
letter
and
thus
burnt
her
boats
ulyth
accepted
the
situation
with
what
equanimity
she
could
muster
invitation
arrived
by
return
of
post
and
was
accepted
with
great
relief
by
miss
bowes
who
had
been
wondering
how
to
dispose
of
her
pupil
during
the
holidays
the
cuckoo
received
the
news
with
such
pathetic
glee
that
ulyth
heart
smote
her
for
not
feeling
more
joyful
herself
are
you
sure
you
want
me
asked
rona
wistfully
of
course
we
do
or
we
would
ask
you
replied
ulyth
hoping
her
fib
might
be
forgiven
i
try
and
not
disgrace
you
volunteered
the
cuckoo
a
few
days
before
the
end
of
the
term
rona
received
a
letter
from
new
zealand
she
rushed
to
ulyth
waving
it
triumphantly
dad
sent
me
this
she
announced
showing
a
very
handsome
cheque
i
wrote
to
him
three
days
after
i
got
here
and
told
him
my
clothes
looked
rubbishy
beside
the
other
girls
and
he
tells
me
to
rig
myself
out
afresh
i
suppose
he
forgot
about
it
till
now
how
i
going
to
get
the
things
there
is
time
to
ask
miss
bowes
to
send
for
them
before
the
holidays
can
i
buy
them
at
the
place
where
you
live
very
well
indeed
and
mother
will
help
you
to
choose
i
know
she
get
you
lovely
clothes
she
has
such
exquisite
taste
she
just
enjoy
it
and
sha
i
just
i
give
away
every
rag
i
brought
with
me
from
new

they
come
in
for
that
rummage
sale
teddie
was
telling
us
about
the
last
lesson
was
finished
the
last
exercise
written
even
the
last
breakfast
had
been
disposed
of
the
boxes
packed
with
great
excitement
the
day
before
were
already
dispatched
and
four
railway
omnibuses
were
waiting
to
take
the
girls
to
llangarmon
junction
station
much
to
their
regret
miss
bowes
would
not
allow
them
to
go
by
glanafon
the
picturesque
route
by
the
ferry
was
reserved
for
summer
weather
in
winter
if
the
day
happened
to
be
stormy
and
the
tide
full
there
was
often
great
difficulty
in
crossing
the
was
muddy
and
slippery
and
even
if
the
train
was
not
missed
altogether
as
sometimes
happened
the
small
voyage
was
quite
in
the
nature
of
an
adventure
miss
bowes
wisdom
was
thoroughly
justified
on
this
particular
morning
for
there
was
a
strong
west
wind
and
the
rain
was
pouring
in
torrents
it
would
have
been
lovely
fun
in
the
flat
there
must
be
big
waves
on
the
river
declared
merle
denham
half
aggrieved
at
missing
such
an
interesting
opportunity
why
but
look
at
the
rain
you
could
hold
up
an
umbrella
for
half
a
second
it
would
be
blown
inside
out
directly
you
be
as
drenched
as
a
drowned
rat
before
you
reached
the
train
preached
her
more
prudent
sister
and
suppose
you
were
blown
off
the
into
the
river
added
beth
broadway
it
would
be
a
nice
way
of
beginning
the
holidays
no
on
a
morning
like
this
i
rather
have
the
omnibus
we
shall
at
least
start
dry
i
so
glad
you
taking
rona
home
with
you
whispered
lizzie
lonsdale
to
ulyth
i
should
have
asked
her
myself
if
you
had
it
would
have
been
a
wretched
christmas
for
her
to
be
left
at
school
i
never
saw
anyone
so
pleased
the
cuckoo
was
indeed
looking
radiant
at
the
golden
prospect
in
store
for
her
much
to
her
surprise
everybody
had
been
particularly
nice
to
her
that
morning
several
girls
had
given
her
their
addresses
and
asked
her
to
write
to
them
miss
bowes
had
been
kindness
itself
and
even
miss
teddington
whose
conduct
was
generally
of
a
spartan
order
when
bidding
her
in
the
study
had
actually
bestowed
an
abrupt
peck
of
a
kiss
a
mark
of
favour
never
before
known
in
the
annals
of
the
school
to
be
sure
she
had
followed
it
with
a
warning
against
relapsing
into
loud
laughter
in
other
people
houses
but
then
she
was
miss
teddington
ulyth
lived
in
staffordshire
and
the
journey
from
north
wales
was
tedious
but
what
schoolgirl
minds
a
long
journey
to
rona
all
was
new
and
delightful
and
to
ulyth
every
meant
that
she
was
so
much
nearer
home
the
travellers
had
a
royal
reception
and
kind
tactful
stanton
managed
at
once
to
put
her
young
guest
at
ease
and
make
her
feel
that
she
was
a
welcome
addition
to
the
family
circle
oswald
ulyth
elder
brother
had
come
from
harrow
only
an
hour
before
and
dorothy
and
peter
the
two
younger
children
were
prancing
about
in
utmost
enthusiasm
at
the
exciting
arrivals
father
has
come
in
yet
asked
ulyth
when
she
had
finished
hugging
her
mother
well
it
will
be
all
the
bigger
treat
when
he
does
oh
oswald
i
did
think
you
could
grow
so
much
in
a
term
dorothy
darling
do
quite
choke
me
peterkin
come
and
shake
hands
with
rona
toby
do
stop
barking
for
half
a
moment
where
tabbyskins
and
please
show
me
the
new
parrot
oh
is
it
lovely
to
be
at
home
again
almost
the
whole
of
the
next
day
was
spent
by
stanton
ulyth
and
their
delighted
visitor
in
a
tour
round
various
outfitting
establishments
an
exhilarating
time
for
rona
who
was
making
her
first
acquaintance
with
the
glories
of
english
shops
their
purchases
were
highly
satisfactory
and
as
ulyth
helped
her
friend
to
dress
for
dinner
on
christmas
day
she
reviewed
the
result
with
the
utmost
complacency
did
i
tell
you
mother
has
good
taste
rona
you
lovely
this
dress
suits
you
to
a
and
the
bronze
slippers
are
so
dainty
and
your
hair
is
so
pretty
you
ca
think
how
it
has
improved
lately
do
i
look
like
other
girls
asked
rona
fingering
the
enamelled
locket
that
had
been
given
her
that
morning
by
and
stanton
rather
a
great
deal
nicer
than
most
i
proud
of
you
i
wish
they
could
all
see
you
at
the
woodlands
i
glad
if
i
sha
disgrace
you
what
a
good
thing
dad
cheque
came
just
in
time
in
her
new
plumage
the
cuckoo
appeared
turned
into
a
tropical
ulyth
had
thought
her
before
but
she
had
not
realized
that
her
was
a
beauty
she
stared
almost
fascinated
at
the
vision
of
blue
eyes
coral
cheeks
white
neck
and
hair
was
this
indeed
the
same
girl
who
had
arrived
at
school
last
september
it
was
like
a
transformation
scene
in
the
pantomime
clothes
undoubtedly
exercise
a
great
effect
on
some
people
and
rona
seemed
to
put
away
her
backwoods
manners
with
her
dresses
there
was
a
dignity
about
her
now
and
a
desire
to
please
which
she
had
never
shown
at
the
woodlands
she
held
herself
straight
walked
gracefully
instead
of
shambling
and
was
careful
to
allow
no
uncouth
expressions
to
escape
her
her
behaviour
was
very
quiet
as
if
she
were
watching
others
or
taking
mental
stock
of
how
to
comport
herself
if
occasionally
she
made
some
slight
mistake
she
flushed
crimson
but
she
never
repeated
it
she
was
learning
the
whole
time
and
the
least
gentle
hint
from
stanton
was
sufficient
for
her
miss
teddington
need
not
have
been
afraid
that
the
loud
laugh
would
offend
the
ears
of
her
friends
it
never
rang
out
once
and
the
voice
was
subdued
to
wonderfully
softened
tones
for
her
hostess
rona
evinced
a
species
of
worship
she
would
follow
her
about
the
house
content
simply
to
be
near
her
and
her
face
would
light
up
at
the
slightest
word
addressed
to
her
the
poor
child
just
wanted
a
good
mothering
said
stanton
to
ulyth
it
is
marvellous
how
fast
she
is
improving
you
make
something
of
your
little
wild
bird
after
all
she
worth
the
trouble
i
no
idea
she
could
grow
into
this
replied
ulyth
oh
motherkins
you
should
have
seen
her
at
first
she
was
a
very
rough
diamond
are
you
glad
to
have
a
hand
in
the
polishing
it
will
be
such
a
triumph
two
members
of
the
household
at
any
rate
saw
no
fault
in
the
visitor
dorothy
and
peter
haunted
her
like
small
persistent
ghosts
begging
for
stories
about
new
zealand
the
accounts
of
her
life
in
the
bush
were
like
a
romance
to
them
and
so
fired
their
enthusiasm
that
in
the
intervals
of
playing
soldiers
they
tried
to
emulate
her
adventures
and
were
found
with
a
in
the
garden
making
a
wild
attempt
to
lasso
the
toby
rona
very
with
them
said
ulyth
she
does
mind
how
they
pull
her
about
and
peter
most
exhausting
sometimes
i
like
to
carry
him
round
the
house
on
my
back
dorothy
perfectly
insatiable
for
stories
it
always
us
another
how
funny
oswald
is
at
present
he
grown
so
outrageously
polite
all
of
a
sudden
i
suppose
it
because
he
in
the
sixth
now
he
was
very
different
last
holidays
he
getting
quite
a
man
the
young
folks
are
growing
up
very
fast
commented
stanton
in
private
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
oswald
and
ulyth
were
babies
in
another
year
or
two
we
shall
begin
to
think
of
dances
oh
do
talk
of
anything
so
dreadful
said
stanton
in
consternation
they
my
babies
still
the
party
on
thursday
is
to
be
quite
a
children
affair
though
motherkins
might
regard
the
coming
festivity
as
entirely
of
a
juvenile
character
the
young
people
took
it
seriously
they
practised
dancing
on
the
polished
linoleum
of
the
nursery
every
evening
rona
had
had
her
first
lessons
at
the
woodlands
and
was
making
heroic
efforts
to
remember
what
she
had
learnt
you
get
on
all
right
ulyth
encouraged
her
that
last
was
ever
so
much
better
you
dropping
into
it
quite
nicely
you
dance
lightly
at
any
rate
now
try
again
with
oswald
while
i
play
ossie
i
proud
of
you
last
christmas
you
were
a
perfect
duffer
at
it
do
you
remember
how
you
sat
out
at
the
warings
you
improved
immensely
now
go
on
and
ulyth
began
to
play
with
her
eyes
alternately
on
the
piano
and
on
the
partners
i
suppose
a
fellow
has
to
get
used
to
light
fantastic
sometime
remarked
oswald
as
after
a
successful
five
minutes
practice
he
and
rona
sat
down
to
rest
perhaps
you
have
to
dance
with
princesses
at
foreign
courts
when
you
a
successful
ambassador
laughed
ulyth
is
that
what
oswald
going
to
be
asked
rona
i
have
tried
the
army
or
the
navy
but
my
wretched
eyes
cut
me
off
from
both
so
it
no
use
worse
luck
said
oswald
i
should
like
to
get
into
the
diplomatic
service
immensely
though
if
i
could
why
ca
you
i
should
think
you
could
do
anything
you
really
wanted
thanks
for
the
compliment
but
it
not
so
easy
as
it
sounds
i
wish
i
had
a
friend
at
court
we
do
know
anybody
in
the
government
sighed
ulyth
not
a
solitary
single
person
i
never
even
seen
a
member
of
parliament
except
of
course
lord
glyncraig
sometimes
at
church
but
then
never
spoken
to
him
stephanie
had
tea
with
him
once
she
does
let
us
forget
that
i
wish
you
had
tea
with
him
and
happened
to
mention
particularly
the
extreme
fascinations
and
abilities
of
your
elder
brother
laughed
oswald
could
lord
glyncraig
be
of
any
use
to
you
asked
rona
she
had
grown
suddenly
thoughtful
he
could
give
me
a
nomination
for
the
diplomatic
service
and
that
would
be
just
the
i
want
but
it
no
use
joking
i
not
likely
to
get
an
introduction
to
him
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
go
into
business
after
all
i
think
when
i
was
ten
i
must
have
been
the
most
objectionable
little
imp
on
the
face
of
creation
said
rona
slowly
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
now
why
this
access
of
penitence
for
bygone
crimes
oh
nothing
replied
the
cuckoo
flushing
i
was
only
just
thinking
of
something
shall
we
try
that
new
step
again
i
rested
now
yours
to
command
madam
returned
oswald
with
a
mock
bow
rona
visit
to
the
stantons
was
a
delightful
series
of
new
impressions
she
made
her
first
acquaintance
with
the
pantomime
and
was
alternately
amused
and
thrilled
as
the
story
of
the
forty
thieves
unfolded
itself
upon
the
stage
not
even
peter
watched
with
more
enthusiasm
and
stanton
declared
it
was
worth
taking
her
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
seeing
her
face
when
ali
baba
disappeared
down
a
as
everything
in
england
was
fresh
to
her
she
was
a
most
easy
guest
to
entertain
and
she
enjoyed
every
separate
experience
from
a
visit
to
the
public
library
with
stanton
to
in
the
nursery
with
peter
and
dorothy
although
it
was
a
quiet
christmas
in
some
respects
friends
were
hospitable
and
included
her
in
the
various
little
invitations
which
were
sent
to
ulyth
and
oswald
so
her
pretty
dresses
had
a
chance
of
being
aired
the
great
event
to
the
young
folk
was
the
party
which
was
to
be
given
at
the
stantons
own
house
and
which
was
to
be
a
kind
of
finish
to
the
holidays
the
girls
revelled
in
every
detail
of
preparation
they
watched
the
carpet
being
taken
up
in
the
the
large
articles
of
furniture
removed
and
the
door
taken
off
its
hinges
they
sprinkled
chalk
on
the
boards
of
the
floor
and
slid
indefatigably
until
the
polish
satisfied
ulyth
critical
taste
they
decorated
the
walls
with
flags
and
evergreens
they
even
offered
their
services
in
the
kitchen
but
met
with
so
cool
a
reception
from
the
busy
cook
that
they
did
not
venture
to
repeat
the
experiment
and
consoled
themselves
with
helping
to
write
the
supper
menus
instead
i
think
i
seen
to
everything
said
stanton
distractedly
the
flowers
and
the
fairy
lamps
and
the
programmes
and
those
extra
boxes
of
crackers
and
the
chocolates
and
the
ring
for
the
trifle
seen
about
the
music
gerald
violin
and
piano
replied
stanton
i
feeling
a
martyr
giving
even
a
simple
children
hop
means
sitting
in
rooms
without
doors
and
living
on
turkey
drumsticks
for
a
fortnight
afterwards
oh
we
get
the
house
straight
again
sooner
than
that
and
you
need
eat
grilled
turkey
unless
you
like
i
do
appreciate
parties
we
must
amuse
the
young
folks
and
it
is
a
grand
affair
if
the
children
meet
together
they
may
as
well
dance
as
play
games
daddikins
how
nasty
you
are
exclaimed
ulyth
pursuing
him
to
administer
chastisement
in
the
shape
of
smacking
kisses
you
know
you
looking
forward
to
it
quite
as
much
as
we
are
that
i
deny
groaned
her
father
as
he
escaped
to
his
snuggery
only
to
find
it
arranged
as
a
ulyth
wore
white
for
the
great
occasion
with
her
best
venetian
beads
and
rona
had
a
palest
gauzy
voile
with
fine
stockings
and
satin
shoes
to
match
dorothy
was
a
bewitching
little
vision
in
pink
and
peter
a
cherub
in
black
velvet
oswald
having
reached
the
stage
of
real
gentleman
required
the
whole
family
to
assist
him
in
the
due
arrangement
of
his
tie
over
which
he
was
more
than
usually
particular
ulyth
even
suspected
him
of
having
tried
to
shave
though
he
denied
the
accusation
fiercely
it
is
always
a
solemn
occasion
waiting
in
the
listening
for
the
first
peal
of
the
bell
announcing
visitors
stanton
was
giving
a
last
touch
to
the
flowers
ulyth
sat
wielding
her
new
fan
a
christmas
present
oswald
was
buttoning
his
gloves
dorothy
too
excited
to
stand
still
for
a
moment
flitted
about
like
a
pink
fairy
i
to
stop
up
half
an
hour
later
than
peter
rona
do
you
hear
that
she
chattered
oh
i
do
hope
the
prestons
will
arrive
first
of
anybody
i
want
to
dance
with
willie
father
let
me
have
a
cracker
just
now
and
it
got
a
whistle
inside
it
i
wish
i
had
a
pocket
where
shall
i
put
it
to
keep
it
safe
oh
i
know
inside
that
vase
as
she
spoke
dorothy
jumped
lightly
on
to
the
seat
of
the
cosy
corner
that
abutted
on
the
fireplace
and
reached
upwards
to
drop
her
whistle
inside
the
ornament
in
her
excitement
she
slipped
tried
to
save
herself
lost
her
footing
and
fell
sideways
over
the
curb
on
to
the
hearth
her
thin
flimsy
dress
was
within
half
an
inch
of
the
fire
but
at
that
instant
rona
who
was
standing
by
clutched
her
and
pulled
her
forwards
it
all
happened
in
three
seconds
she
was
safe
before
her
father
had
time
to
run
across
the
room
the
family
stared
aghast
whew
that
was
a
near
shave
gasped
oswald
dorothy
too
much
surprised
and
frightened
to
cry
was
clinging
to
her
mother
stanton
acting
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
rushed
to
the
telephone
to
try
if
any
ironmonger
shop
in
the
town
was
still
open
and
could
immediately
send
up
a
the
fireplaces
in
all
the
other
rooms
were
well
guarded
but
in
the
the
hearth
was
so
wide
and
the
curb
so
high
that
the
precaution
had
not
been
considered
necessary
it
only
shows
how
absolutely
vital
it
is
to
leave
no
chance
of
an
accident
said
stanton
returning
from
the
telephone
matthews
are
sending
a
boy
up
at
once
with
a
guard
if
it
had
been
for
promptitude
oh
there
the
bell
oswald
fetch
your
mother
a
glass
of
water
poor
stanton
looked
very
pale
but
had
recovered
her
composure
sufficiently
to
receive
her
young
guests
by
the
time
they
were
ushered
into
the
dorothy
forgot
her
fright
in
the
pleasure
of
welcoming
her
friends
the
prestons
and
everything
went
on
as
if
the
accident
had
not
occurred
stanton
indeed
kept
a
close
watch
all
the
evening
to
see
that
guards
were
not
pushed
aside
from
the
fires
and
stanton
eyes
watched
with
more
than
usual
solicitude
a
certain
little
pink
figure
as
it
went
dancing
round
the
room
the
visitors
knew
nothing
of
the
accident
that
had
been
avoided
and
there
was
no
check
on
the
mirth
of
the
party
the
guests
were
of
all
ages
from
peter
kindergarten
comrades
to
girls
who
were
nearly
but
it
was
really
all
the
jollier
for
the
mixture
tall
and
short
danced
together
with
a
happy
disregard
of
inches
and
even
a
thorough
enjoyment
of
the
disparity
rona
spent
a
royal
evening
her
host
and
hostess
had
been
kindness
itself
before
but
it
seemed
as
if
they
conspired
together
to
give
her
the
best
of
everything
she
had
her
pick
of
partners
the
place
of
honour
at
supper
and
by
most
egregious
cheating
the
ring
somehow
tumbled
on
to
her
plate
out
of
the
trifle
i
getting
spoilt
she
said
to
oswald
the
mater
ready
to
kiss
your
boots
he
returned
i
never
saw
anything
so
quick
as
the
way
you
snatched
old
dolly
all
good
things
come
to
an
end
some
time
even
holidays
and
one
morning
towards
the
end
of
january
witnessed
a
taxi
at
the
door
and
various
bags
and
packages
labelled
llangarmon
junction
stowed
inside
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
i
have
any
words
gulped
rona
as
she
hugged
motherkins
do
your
best
at
school
and
remember
certain
little
things
we
talked
about
whispered
stanton
kissing
her
we
shall
expect
to
see
you
here
again
chapter
viii
the
stunt
the
general
verdict
on
rona
when
she
arrived
back
at
the
woodlands
was
that
she
was
wonderfully
improved
it
is
only
her
dresses
said
gertrude
oliver
though
she
looks
a
different
girl
in
her
new
clothes
her
whole
style
altered
she
used
to
be
so
fearfully
loud
she
really
toned
down
in
the
most
amazing
fashion
i
could
have
believed
it
possible
i
afraid
it
only
a
veneer
declared
stephanie
with
a
slighting
little
laugh
you
find
plenty
of
raw
backwoods
underneath
ready
to
crop
up
when
she
off
her
guard
you
should
have
heard
her
this
morning
and
she
broke
an
added
beth
broadway
well
she
not
perfect
yet
of
course
but
i
stick
to
it
that
improved
oh
i
dare
say
but
ulyth
welcome
to
keep
her
cub
she
always
be
more
or
less
of
a
trial
what
else
can
you
expect
bred
in
the
bone
will
come
out
yes
i
a
great
believer
in
heredity
urged
beth
taking
up
the
cudgels
for
her
chum
if
you
have
ancestors
it
gives
you
a
decided
pull
everybody
has
ancestors
you
goose
corrected
gertrude
well
of
course
i
mean
aristocratic
ones
the
others
do
count
it
must
make
a
difference
whether
your
grandfather
was
a
gentleman
or
a
rona
says
herself
she
a
democrat
i
sure
she
looked
the
part
when
she
arrived
i
do
know
that
she
exactly
looks
it
now
though
said
gertrude
championing
rona
for
once
everyone
at
the
school
realized
that
the
cuckoo
was
trying
to
behave
herself
the
struggles
towards
perfection
were
sometimes
almost
pathetic
though
the
girls
mostly
viewed
them
from
the
humorous
side
she
would
sit
up
suddenly
bolt
upright
at
the
tea
table
if
miss
bowes
eye
suggested
that
she
was
lolling
she
apologized
for
accidents
at
which
she
had
laughed
before
and
she
corrected
herself
if
a
backwoods
expression
escaped
her
am
i
really
any
shakes
smarter
i
mean
more
toned
up
than
i
was
she
asked
ulyth
anxiously
you
far
better
than
you
were
last
term
do
go
on
trying
all
will
they
take
me
as
a
candidate
in
the
league
i
expect
so
but
we
shall
have
to
ask
arnold
about
that
since
the
great
reunion
by
the
stream
in
september
there
had
been
no
meetings
of
the
league
arnold
had
been
ill
and
then
had
gone
away
to
recruit
her
health
and
no
one
was
able
to
take
her
place
as
guardian
of
the
fire
she
was
recovered
now
and
at
home
again
and
had
promised
to
help
to
make
up
for
lost
time
by
superintending
a
gathering
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
term
it
was
to
be
held
in
the
big
hall
of
the
school
though
the
girls
begged
hard
to
have
it
pleading
that
on
a
fine
evening
they
could
keep
perfectly
warm
and
it
would
only
resemble
a
fifth
of
november
affair
that
may
be
all
very
well
for
you
but
i
not
going
to
risk
arnold
catching
cold
returned
miss
bowes
which
argument
put
a
final
stop
to
the
idea
we
have
ripping
fun
in
the
hall
if
we
ca
be
outside
beamed
addie
i
always
enjoy
a
stunt
what
a
stunt
asked
rona
a
stunt
why
it
just
a
stunt
it
an
american
word
explained
lizzie
it
means
just
having
any
fun
that
comes
an
impromptu
kind
of
thing
you
know
we
sing
or
recite
or
act
or
dance
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
anything
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
and
anybody
may
be
called
upon
at
any
moment
to
stand
up
and
perform
without
knowing
beforehand
queried
rona
looking
yes
that
the
fun
of
it
we
have
a
bag
with
all
our
names
written
on
slips
of
paper
and
we
draw
them
out
one
by
one
to
fill
up
the
programme
nobody
knows
who
to
come
next
you
may
be
the
very
first
or
you
may
sit
quaking
all
the
evening
and
never
be
called
at
all
i
hope
to
goodness
i
mean
i
hope
very
much
i
sha
be
drawn
you
never
know
so
you
better
have
something
in
your
mind
eye
punctually
at
six
on
the
appointed
night
the
whole
school
filed
into
the
hall
each
girl
carrying
a
candle
in
a
candlestick
saluting
their
leader
they
ranged
themselves
round
the
room
for
the
opening
ceremony
at
an
indoor
meeting
this
was
of
necessity
different
from
the
kindling
of
the
but
it
had
a
certain
impressiveness
of
its
own
first
the
lamps
were
extinguished
and
the
room
was
placed
in
entire
darkness
then
arnold
struck
a
match
and
lighted
her
candle
which
she
held
towards
the
of
highest
rank
who
lighted
hers
from
it
and
performed
the
same
service
for
her
next
neighbour
in
this
way
one
after
another
the
candles
were
lighted
all
round
the
room
every
girl
saying
as
she
offered
the
flame
to
her
comrade
i
pass
on
my
light
after
the
shining
song
was
sung
all
the
candlesticks
were
arranged
on
the
large
central
table
taking
the
place
the
would
have
occupied
the
business
of
the
meeting
came
first
the
was
read
and
the
recorders
gave
their
reports
of
the
last
gathering
several
members
were
awarded
honours
for
knowing
the
stars
being
able
to
observe
certain
things
in
geology
and
field
botany
or
for
ability
in
outdoor
sports
or
indoor
occupations
such
as
carpentry
stencilling
or
sewing
the
ambulance
work
and
the
knitting
done
last
term
were
specially
noted
and
commended
a
few
new
candidates
applied
for
enrolment
and
their
qualifications
were
carefully
considered
by
the
guardian
of
the
fire
rona
after
undergoing
the
league
catechism
from
catherine
sullivan
the
head
girl
and
chief
had
submitted
her
name
as
candidate
and
now
waited
with
much
anxiety
to
hear
whether
she
would
be
accepted
after
several
others
had
been
admitted
arnold
at
last
called
corona
margarita
mitchell
quite
startled
at
the
unaccustomed
sound
of
her
full
christian
name
rona
saluted
and
stepped
forward
you
have
passed
only
three
out
of
the
seven
tests
required
said
arnold
i
afraid
you
will
have
to
try
again
rona
and
see
if
you
can
be
more
successful
before
the
next
meeting
no
candidate
can
be
accepted
except
on
very
good
grounds
that
is
the
law
of
the
league
much
crestfallen
the
cuckoo
fell
back
into
her
place
and
arnold
was
just
about
to
read
the
next
name
when
ulyth
interrupted
please
guardian
if
a
candidate
has
shown
unusual
presence
of
mind
may
that
not
stand
in
place
of
some
of
the
other
tests
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
how
does
that
apply
in
this
case
rona
has
saved
a
life
declared
ulyth
then
explained
briefly
how
dorothy
had
fallen
on
to
the
hearth
and
had
been
caught
back
from
the
fire
in
the
very
nick
of
time
in
her
thin
dress
she
would
probably
have
been
burnt
to
death
but
for
rona
quickness
added
ulyth
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
i
had
not
heard
of
this
replied
arnold
rona
is
very
greatly
to
be
congratulated
on
her
presence
of
mind
yes
i
may
safely
say
that
it
can
cancel
the
tests
in
which
she
has
failed
and
that
we
may
enrol
her
as
a
candidate
corona
margarita
mitchell
if
for
three
months
you
preserve
a
good
character
in
the
school
and
learn
to
recite
the
seven
rules
of
the
law
you
may
then
present
yourself
as
eligible
for
the
initial
rank
of
in
the
league
there
is
your
candidate
badge
immensely
gratified
rona
received
her
little
bow
of
blue
ribbon
she
had
hardly
dared
to
hope
for
success
as
catherine
had
been
rather
withering
over
her
catechism
and
had
warned
her
that
she
would
probably
be
disqualified
it
was
pleasant
to
meet
with
encouragement
and
especially
to
be
commended
before
the
whole
school
she
had
never
dreamt
of
such
luck
and
she
looked
her
grateful
thanks
at
ulyth
across
the
room
she
was
the
last
but
one
on
the
list
of
applicants
and
when
jessie
howard
alas
poor
jessie
had
been
rejected
the
ceremonial
part
of
the
meeting
was
over
the
girls
smiled
for
now
the
stunt
was
to
begin
catherine
produced
the
bag
shook
it
well
and
handed
it
to
arnold
who
drew
out
a
slip
of
paper
marjorie
earnshaw
she
announced
glad
it
one
of
the
sixth
to
open
the
ball
murmured
some
of
the
younger
girls
as
marjorie
stepped
to
the
circle
reserved
for
performers
in
front
of
the
table
the
owner
of
the
one
guitar
in
the
school
was
always
much
in
request
at
gatherings
so
it
seemed
a
fortunate
chance
that
her
name
should
be
drawn
first
she
had
brought
her
instrument
so
as
to
be
prepared
in
case
the
lot
fell
on
her
and
giving
the
e
string
a
last
hurried
tuning
she
sat
down
and
began
a
popular
american
ditty
it
was
a
favourite
among
the
girls
for
it
had
a
lively
rollicking
chorus
which
they
sang
with
great
gusto
fifty
voices
roaring
out
do
forget
your
dinah
seemed
to
break
the
ice
and
set
the
fun
going
marjorie
e
string
snapped
suddenly
but
she
played
as
best
she
could
on
the
others
though
she
confessed
afterwards
that
she
felt
like
a
horse
that
has
lost
its
shoe
except
for
this
accident
she
would
have
responded
to
the
enthusiastic
calls
of
encore
as
it
was
she
retired
into
the
background
to
fix
a
new
string
it
lent
a
decided
element
of
excitement
to
the
programme
that
nobody
knew
what
the
next
item
was
to
be
the
lot
as
it
happened
fell
on
one
of
the
younger
girls
who
was
overwhelmed
with
shyness
and
could
only
with
great
urging
be
persuaded
to
recite
a
short
piece
of
poetry
by
the
law
of
the
stunt
everybody
was
obliged
to
perform
if
called
upon
so
aveline
fired
off
her
sixteen
lines
of
longfellow
with
breathless
speed
and
fled
back
joyfully
to
the
ranks
of
the
juniors
two
piano
solos
and
a
followed
then
the
turn
came
to
doris
deane
a
member
of
the
upper
fifth
speciality
was
acting
so
she
promptly
begged
for
two
assistants
and
chose
from
iv
b
a
couple
of
junior
members
who
had
practised
with
her
before
taking
nellie
and
trissie
for
asia
and
australia
she
gave
the
scene
from
wiggs
of
the
cabbage
where
that
delightful
but
haphazard
heroine
gets
herself
and
the
children
ready
to
go
to
the
opera
the
zeal
with
which
she
ironed
their
dresses
her
alternate
scoldings
and
cajolings
her
wild
hunt
for
the
tickets
which
all
the
while
were
stuck
in
her
belt
the
grandeur
of
her
deportment
when
the
family
was
at
last
prepared
for
the
outing
all
were
most
amusingly
represented
doris
was
really
a
born
actress
and
so
completely
carried
her
audience
with
her
that
the
lack
of
costumes
and
scenery
was
not
felt
in
the
force
of
the
reality
that
she
managed
to
throw
into
her
part
covered
with
glory
she
gave
place
to
her
successor
who
while
bewailing
the
hardness
of
her
luck
in
having
to
follow
so
smart
a
performance
recited
a
humorous
ballad
which
won
peals
of
applause
arnold
again
dipped
her
hand
into
the
bag
and
unfolded
a
twist
of
paper
corona
mitchell
she
read
not
me
surely
i
ca
do
anything
objected
rona
hastily
you
have
to
laughed
the
girls
no
one
let
off
i
ca
i
tell
you
i
no
parlour
tricks
give
us
a
story
rona
suggested
ulyth
one
of
those
new
zealand
adventures
you
used
to
tell
to
peter
and
dorothy
they
loved
them
yes
yes
a
story
that
would
be
spiffing
clamoured
the
girls
sit
on
the
floor
near
the
fire
and
we
all
squat
near
you
we
have
had
a
story
for
ages
and
ages
tell
it
just
as
you
did
at
home
urged
ulyth
i
try
my
best
sighed
rona
taking
a
small
stool
near
the
fire
so
as
to
be
slightly
above
the
audience
clustered
round
the
hearthrug
it
happened
about
a
year
ago
she
began
that
in
new
zealand
you
know
because
the
seasons
are
just
opposite
it
was
pamela
higson
birthday
and
i
been
asked
to
go
over
for
the
day
i
saddled
brownie
my
best
pony
and
started
at
seven
because
it
a
ride
to
the
higsons
farm
and
i
wanted
to
be
early
so
as
to
have
time
for
plenty
of
fun
brownie
was
fresh
and
he
was
tired
when
i
got
there
so
we
decided
to
give
him
an
hour
rest
and
then
ride
up
into
the
bush
and
have
a
picnic
pamela
showed
me
her
birthday
presents
while
we
waited
she
had
a
box
sent
her
by
the
mail
and
she
was
very
delighted
about
it
well
at
perhaps
eleven
i
set
off
with
pamela
and
the
rest
of
the
higson
children
there
was
jake
just
my
own
age
and
billy
a
little
younger
and
connie
and
minnie
the
two
smallest
oh
yes
we
each
had
our
own
horse
or
pony
everybody
rides
out
there
we
slung
baskets
and
tin
cans
over
our
saddles
and
then
started
up
by
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
towards
the
head
of
the
gully
it
was
very
hot
january
like
july
here
but
we
all
had
big
hats
and
we
did
care
it
was
such
fun
to
be
together
when
your
nearest
neighbours
are
twelve
miles
off
you
do
see
them
often
enough
to
get
tired
of
them
billy
was
always
making
jokes
and
jake
was
jolly
too
in
a
quiet
kind
of
way
sometimes
we
could
all
ride
abreast
and
sometimes
we
had
to
go
in
single
file
and
our
horses
seemed
to
enjoy
it
as
much
as
we
did
brownie
loved
company
so
it
was
a
treat
for
him
as
well
as
for
me
the
place
we
were
going
to
was
a
piece
of
high
land
that
lay
at
the
top
of
the
valley
above
the
higsons
block
there
were
generally
plenty
of
berries
up
there
and
we
thought
they
just
be
ripe
it
took
us
a
fairly
long
time
to
do
the
climb
because
there
was
no
proper
road
only
a
rough
track
it
was
lovely
though
when
we
got
up
we
had
a
splendid
view
down
the
gully
and
the
air
was
so
much
cooler
and
fresher
than
it
had
been
at
the
farm
we
tethered
our
horses
and
gathered
scrub
to
make
a
fire
and
boil
our
kettle
in

no
one
thinks
of
having
a
meal
without
drinking
tea
with
it
we
the
jolliest
picnic
the
higsons
were
famous
for
their
cakes
and
they
brought
plenty
with
them
i
can
tell
you
we
did
leave
very
many
in
the
baskets
put
out
our
jake
said
when
we
finished
so
we
all
set
to
work
and
stamped
it
out
carefully
everything
was
so
dry
with
the
heat
that
a
spark
might
easily
have
set
fire
to
the
bush
then
we
took
our
cans
and
went
off
to
find
berries
there
were
heaps
of
them
so
we
just
picked
and
picked
and
picked
for
ever
so
long
suddenly
when
we
were
talking
we
heard
a
noise
and
looked
round
there
was
a
stampede
among
the
horses
and
two
of
them
billy
and
connie
had
broken
loose
and
were
careering
down
the
gully
we
ran
as
quick
as
lightning
to
the
others
for
fear
they
might
also
free
themselves
and
follow
i
caught
brownie
by
the
bridle
and
soothed
him
as
well
as
i
could
but
he
was
very
excited
and
trembling
and
kept
sniffing
then
i
saw
what
had
frightened
him
for
a
puff
of
wind
brought
a
puff
of
smoke
with
it
and
ahead
of
us
i
saw
a
dark
column
whirl
up
towards
the
sky
even
the
youngest
child
who
lived
in
the
bush
knows
what
that
means
when
all
the
grass
and
everything
is
so
dry
the
least
thing
will
start
a
fire
sometimes
are
careless
and
the
wind
blows
sparks
sometimes
even
a
piece
of
an
old
bottle
left
lying
about
will
act
as
a
we
did
inquire
the
reason
all
we
knew
was
that
we
must
tear
back
to
the
farm
as
rapidly
as
we
could
bush
fires
spread
fearfully
fast
and
this
one
would
probably
sweep
straight
down
the
gorge
with
two
animals
gone
luck
was
against
us
billy
took
minnie
pony
connie
mounted
behind
jake
and
i
made
minnie
come
with
me
on
brownie
because
he
was
so
strong
and
better
able
to
bear
the
double
burden
than
pamela
horse
it
was
well
for
us
we
were
good
riders
for
we
pelted
down
that
gully
fit
to
break
our
necks
brownie
was
a
little
beast
but
the
way
he
went
slithering
over
rocks
would
have
scared
me
if
i
had
been
more
afraid
of
the
fire
behind
we
knew
it
would
be
touch
and
go
whether
we
could
save
the
farm
or
not
if
the
men
were
all
far
away
there
would
be
very
little
chance
though
we
meant
to
do
our
level
best
well
as
i
was
saying
we
just
stampeded
down
the
gully
and
our
horses
kept
their
feet
somehow
i
guess
we
arrived
at
the
house
like
a
tornado
we
yelled
out
our
news
and
to
some
of
the
men
we
could
see
working
in
the
distance
they
came
running
at
once
and
higson
sent
up
the
rocket
that
was
used
on
the
farm
as
a
fortunately
the
rest
of
the
men
had
only
gone
a
short
way
they
were
back
almost
directly
and
everybody
set
to
work
to
make
a
wide
ring
of
bare
land
round
the
farm
they
cut
down
trees
and
threw
up
earth
and
burnt
a
great
patch
of
grass
and
we
children
helped
too
for
all
we
were
worth
we
were
only
just
in
time
we
could
see
the
great
cloud
of
smoke
coming
down
the
valley
and
as
it
grew
nearer
we
heard
the
roaring
or
the
fire
it
seemed
to
bear
down
on
us
suddenly
in
a
great
burning
sheet
for
a
moment
or
two
the
air
was
so
hot
that
we
could
scarcely
breathe
then
the
flame
struck
our
ring
of
bare
land
and
parted
in
two
and
passed
on
either
side
of
us
leaving
the
farm
as
an
island
we
watched
it
go
crackling
farther
down
the
valley
till
at
last
it
spent
itself
in
a
rocky
creek
where
it
had
nothing
to
feed
on
all
the
place
it
had
passed
over
was
burnt
to
cinders
a
horrible
black
mass
only
the
house
and
the
buildings
and
a
few
fields
round
them
were
untouched
it
was
an
awful
birthday
for
poor
pamela
was
your
own
farm
hurt
asked
the
girls
breathlessly
as
rona
paused
in
her
story
not
at
all
you
see
it
was
in
quite
a
different
valley
and
the
fire
had
been
near
jake
rode
home
with
me
to
make
sure
i
was
safe
dad
had
even
seen
the
smoke
suppose
you
had
noticed
the
fire
when
you
were
up
in
the
hills
then
we
should
have
been
burnt
to
cinders
farm
and
all
i
think
rona
most
thrilling
adventure
will
have
to
end
our
stunt
said
arnold
it
nearly
eight
time
to
wind
up
and
get
ready
for
supper
attention
please
each
girl
take
her
candle
our
pianist
catherine
will
you
start
the
song
i
a
candidate
now
thanks
to
you
exulted
rona
to
ulyth
perhaps
by
easter
i
may
be
a
it
something
to
work
for
is
it
said
arnold
who
happened
to
overhear
chapter
ix
a
january
picnic
winter
in
the
craigwen
valley
instead
of
proving
a
dreary
season
of
frost
or
fog
was
apt
to
be
as
variable
as
april
sheltered
by
the
tall
mountains
the
climate
was
mild
and
though
snow
would
lie
on
the
peaks
of
penllwyd
and
cwm
dinas
it
rarely
rested
on
the
lower
levels
very
early
in
january
the
garden
at
the
woodlands
could
boast
brave
clumps
of
snowdrops
and
polyanthus
a
venturous
wallflower
or
two
and
quite
a
show
of
yellow
jessamine
over
the
south
porch
the
glade
by
the
stream
never
seemed
to
feel
the
touch
of
winter
many
of
the
kept
their
brown
leaves
till
the
new
ones
came
to
replace
them
honeysuckle
trails
and
brambles
continually
put
out
verdant
shoots
the
lastrea
ferns
that
grew
near
the
brink
of
the
water
showed
tall
green
fronds
untouched
by
frost
and
the
moss
was
never
more
vivid
the
glen
indeed
had
a
special
beauty
in
for
the
bare
boughs
of
the
alders
took
exquisite
tender
shades
of
purples
and
greys
warming
into
amber
in
the
sunshine
and
defying
the
cunningest
brush
which
artist
could
wield
to
do
them
justice
by
the
middle
of
january
the
tightly
rolled
tails
on
the
hazels
were
unfolding
themselves
and
beginning
to
scatter
pollen
and
a
few
stray
specimens
of
last
summer
flowers
a
belated
campion
or
hawkweed
would
struggle
out
from
the
rough
grass
under
a
protecting
the
days
varied
rain
the
penalty
for
living
near
mountains
often
swept
down
the
valley
bringing
glorious
and
sending
the
stream
swirling
over
its
boulders
with
a
boom
of
myriad
voices
sometimes
the
sudden
swelling
of
its
tributaries
made
the
craigwen
river
overtop
its
banks
flooding
the
meadows
till
augmented
by
the
high
tide
its
waters
filled
the
valley
from
end
to
end
like
a
lake
this
occasional
flooding
of
the
marsh
was
good
for
the
fields
and
ensured
a
rich
next
summer
so
the
school
felt
it
could
enjoy
the
picturesque
aspect
without
needing
to
deplore
loss
to
the
farmers
on
the
of
january
miss
teddington
had
a
birthday
she
would
have
suppressed
the
fact
altogether
if
possible
or
treated
it
in
quite
a
surreptitious
and
fashion
but
with
her
autograph
plainly
written
in
separate
the
fates
were
against
her
she
was
obliged
to
receive
the
united
congratulations
of
the
school
to
accept
with
feigned
surprise
the
present
which
was
offered
her
and
to
say
a
few
appropriate
words
of
appreciation
and
thanks
she
did
not
do
it
well
for
her
manner
was
always
abrupt
and
even
verged
on
the
ungracious
the
greatest
contrast
to
the
bland
and
tactful
utterances
of
miss
bowes
this
year
the
annual
ceremony
was
gone
through
as
usual
catherine
as
head
girl
proffered
the
good
wishes
and
the
volume
of
carlyle
lucy
morris
on
behalf
of
the
nature
study
union
handed
a
bouquet
of
polyanthus
rosemary
periwinkle
pansies
and
pink
daisies
culled
from
the
garden
the
earliness
of
which
miss
teddington
remarked
upon
as
though
she
had
not
watched
their
progress
for
the
last
week
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
all
she
said
jerkily
looking
nevertheless
as
if
she
were
longing
to
bolt
for
the
door
but
she
was
not
yet
to
make
her
escape
there
was
another
ceremony
to
be
observed
all
eyes
were
turned
to
miss
bowes
who
rose
as
usual
to
the
occasion
i
think
girls
she
said
pleasantly
that
considering
it
is
miss
teddington
birthday
we
ought
to
take
some
special
notice
of
the
occasion
suppose
we
ask
her
to
grant
a
holiday
so
that
we
may
make
an
expedition
in
her
honour
who
votes
for
this
hands
were
instantly
raised
and
voices
cried
i
do
miss
teddington
who
utterly
disapproved
of
odd
holidays
during
submitted
with
what
grace
she
could
muster
and
gave
a
rather
chilly
assent
which
was
immediately
drowned
in
a
storm
of
clapping
the
girls
who
always
suspected
the
principals
of
an
annual
argument
on
the
subject
felt
they
had
scored
for
this
year
at
any
rate
and
were
certainly
one
holiday
to
the
good
there
was
no
question
at
all
as
to
where
they
should
walk
every
january
weather
permitting
they
turned
their
steps
in
the
same
direction
on
certain
portions
of
the
marsh
near
the
river
grew
fields
of
wild
snowdrops
and
to
go
snowdropping
before
february
set
in
was
as
much
an
institution
as
turning
their
money
when
they
first
heard
the
cuckoo
or
wishing
at
the
sight
of
the
earliest
white
butterfly
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
the
delicate
fiction
of
asking
for
the
holiday
was
preserved
it
was
such
a
qua
that
the
cook
was
prepared
for
it
she
had
baked
jam
tartlets
and
made
potted
meat
the
day
before
and
was
already
cutting
sandwiches
and
packing
them
in
greaseproof
paper
every
girl
at
the
woodlands
possessed
a
basket
just
as
she
owned
a
penknife
or
a
french
dictionary
it
was
equally
indispensable
she
would
carry
out
her
lunch
in
it
and
bring
it
back
filled
with
flowers
berries
or
nature
specimens
as
the
case
might
be
each
was
labelled
with
the
owner
name
and
hung
in
a
big
cupboard
under
the
stairs
some
of
the
girls
also
used
with
crooked
handles
which
were
found
convenient
weapons
for
hooking
down
brambles
or
branches
of
catkins
shortly
after
ten
the
school
started
every
woodlander
bearing
her
basket
containing
sandwiches
two
tartlets
an
orange
and
a
small
enamelled
there
were
to
be
no
so
cold
water
from
the
stream
would
have
to
suffice
and
would
make
tea
all
the
more
welcome
when
they
returned
home
it
was
quite
a
fine
morning
with
sudden
gleams
of
sunshine
that
burst
from
the
clouds
and
spread
in
long
slanting
golden
rays
over
the
valley
just
the
kind
of
sky
the
early
masters
of
landscape
painting
loved
to
put
in
their
pictures
with
a
background
of
neutral
tint
and
a
bright
light
in
the
foreground
the
little
solitary
farms
stood
out
white
here
and
there
against
the
green
of
the
fields
the
on
the
showed
darkly
in
contrast
to
the
bare
larches
cwm
dinas
was
inky
purple
but
penllwyd
was
capped
with
snow
miss
bowes
who
was
not
a
good
walker
had
not
ventured
to
join
the
expedition
but
miss
teddington
strode
along
at
the
head
of
the
party
chatting
to
some
of
the
sixth
form
i
sure
she
wishing
she
were
giving
a
latin
lesson
instead
said
lizzie
lonsdale
she
looks
rather
grim
perhaps
she
remembering
she
a
year
older
returned
beth
broadway
how
old
is
she
do
you
think
giggled
addie
knighton
that
my
child
is
a
secret
that
will
never
be
divulged
i
dare
say
you
like
to
know
i
should
immensely
then
you
wo
be
gratified
unless
you
go
to
somerset
house
and
hunt
her
name
up
in
the
register
of
births
even
then
you
find
it
difficult
for
you
do
know
her
christian
name
only
her
initial
yes
she
never
will
write
more
than
teddington
in
m
might
stand
for
mary
or
martha
or
margaret
or
millicent
or
anything
does
even
miss
bowes
know
if
she
does
she
wo
tell
it
a
well
never
mind
we
call
her
teddie
and
that
will
do
many
were
the
ingenious
devices
which
the
girls
had
adopted
for
trying
to
find
out
both
miss
teddington
christian
name
and
her
age
they
spoke
of
historic
events
that
had
happened
before
their
parents
had
been
born
fondly
hoping
she
might
betray
some
memory
of
them
and
commit
herself
but
she
was
not
to
be
caught
she
treated
all
events
however
recent
or
old
from
a
purely
impersonal
standpoint
and
left
them
still
in
the
dark
as
to
whether
she
was
an
infant
in
arms
at
the
time
or
an
adult
able
to
enjoy
the
newspapers
on
the
subject
of
names
she
was
indifferent
and
would
express
no
opinion
on
the
relative
merits
of
mary
martha
margaret
millicent
marion
muriel
mona
or
maud
it
either
plain
mary
or
something
so
fearfully
fancy
she
wo
own
up
to
it
decided
the
girls
in
whatever
decade
miss
teddington
birthday
placed
her
this
year
she
was
certainly
in
the
prime
of
life
and
energy
as
concerned
the
school
her
keen
eyes
noticed
everything
and
woe
betide
the
slacker
who
thought
to
escape
her
and
dared
bring
an
unprepared
lesson
to
class
her
sarcasms
on
such
occasions
made
her
victims
writhe
though
they
were
apt
to
be
witty
enough
to
amuse
the
rest
of
the
form
though
like
john
gilpin
wife
she
was
on
pleasure
bent
she
never
for
a
moment
forgot
she
was
in
charge
and
kept
turning
to
see
that
everybody
was
following
and
nobody
straggling
far
off
in
the
rear
it
was
a
walk
from
the
woodlands
to
the
snowdrop
meadows
first
along
the
high
road
with
an
occasional
short
cut
across
a
field
or
through
a
spinney
then
down
a
deep
narrow
lane
past
a
farm
where
the
sight
of
a
lamb
the
first
of
the
season
caused
great
excitement
some
of
the
girls
who
loved
old
superstitions
pretended
to
divine
their
luck
by
whether
it
was
standing
facing
them
or
otherwise
when
they
first
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
but
the
general
verdict
deciding
that
it
was
exactly
sideways
they
found
it
impossible
to
give
any
accurate
predictions
for
the
future
you
better
keep
to
something
vague
that
can
be
construed
two
ways
like
the
delphic
oracle
or
moore
laughed
ulyth
once
past
the
farm
the
walk
began
to
grow
specially
interesting
the
deep
lane
only
intended
for
use
in
summer
when
carts
brought
loads
of
hay
from
the
marsh
was
turned
by
winter
rains
into
the
bed
of
a
stream
the
girls
picked
their
way
at
first
along
the
bank
then
by
jumping
from
stone
to
stone
but
finally
the
water
grew
so
deep
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
farther
without
wading
they
had
been
in
the
same
emergency
before
so
it
did
not
daunt
their
enthusiasm
one
and
all
they
scaled
the
high
wide
loosely
built
wall
to
their
left
here
they
could
walk
as
on
a
terrace
with
the
flooded
lane
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
rushing
porth
powys
stream
making
its
hurrying
way
to
join
the
craigwen
river
it
was
not
at
all
an
easy
progress
for
the
wall
was
overgrown
with
hazel
bushes
and
a
tangle
of
brambles
and
its
unmortared
surface
had
deep
holes
into
which
the
unwary
might
put
a
foot
for
several
hundred
yards
they
struggled
on
decidedly
to
the
detriment
of
their
clothing
and
rather
encumbered
by
their
baskets
then
at
last
they
reached
the
particular
corner
they
were
seeking
and
scrambled
down
into
the
meadow
this
field
was
such
a
favourite
with
the
girls
that
they
had
come
to
regard
it
almost
as
their
own
property
miss
teddington
had
found
it
out
many
years
ago
and
its
discovery
was
always
considered
a
point
in
her
roll
of
merit
it
was
an
expanse
of
grassy
land
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
porth
powys
stream
and
on
the
other
by
a
deep
dyke
and
leading
down
over
a
rushy
tract
to
the
banks
of
the
river
the
view
over
the
many
miles
of
marshland
with
the
blue
mountains
rising
up
behind
and
the
silvery
gleam
of
the
river
was
superb
the
brown
quivering
feathery
reeds
made
a
glorious
foreground
for
the
amber
and
vivid
green
of
the
banks
farther
on
and
the
gorgeous
sky
effects
of
rolling
clouds
glinting
sun
and
patches
of
bluest
heaven
were
like
the
beginning
of
one
of
john
visions
near
at
hand
dotted
all
over
the
field
bloomed
the
wild
snowdrops
in
utmost
profusion
with
a
looser
habit
of
growth
a
longer
stalk
and
a
wider
flower
than
the
garden
variety
lovely
blossoms
with
their
tiny
green
markings
they
stood
like
fairy
bells
among
the
grass
so
dainty
and
perfect
it
seemed
almost
a
sacrilege
to
disturb
them
the
girls
however
were
not
troubled
with
any
such
scruples
and
set
to
work
to
pick
in
hot
haste
i
going
down
by
the
stream
said
ulyth
one
gets
far
the
best
there
if
one
hunts
about
and
i
brought
my
stick
rona
addie
and
lizzie
joined
her
and
with
considerable
difficulty
scrambled
down
to
the
water
edge
for
those
who
preferred
quality
to
quantity
and
who
did
not
mind
getting
torn
by
briers
this
was
undoubtedly
the
place
to
come
in
pockets
of
fine
their
roots
stretching
into
the
stream
grew
the
very
biggest
and
finest
of
the
snowdrops
most
of
them
peeped
through
a
very
tangle
of
brambles
but
who
minded
scratched
arms
and
torn
sleeves
to
secure
such
treasures
look
at
these
the
stalks
must
be
nine
inches
long
and
the
nearly
as
big
as
a
lent
lily
exulted
ulyth
i
shall
send
them
to
mother
with
some
hazel
catkins
and
some
lovely
moss
everybody
will
be
sending
away
boxes
said
addie
the
postman
will
have
a
load
what
that
cried
lizzie
for
a
sudden
rush
and
scuffle
sounded
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
a
rat
leaped
wildly
from
the
bank
and
a
shaved
poodle
half
jumped
half
fell
after
it
into
the
water
the
rat
was
gone
in
an
eighth
of
a
second
but
the
dog
found
himself
in
difficulties
it
was
a
case
of
look
before
you
leap
and
a
fat
wheezy
french
poodle
is
not
at
home
in
a
stream
oh
the
poor
little
beast
drowning
exclaimed
ulyth
in
horror
rona
with
extreme
promptitude
had
flown
to
the
rescue
close
by
where
they
stood
the
trunk
of
a
alder
stretched
out
over
the
water
it
was
green
and
slippery
and
anything
but
an
inviting
bridge
but
she
crawled
along
it
somehow
and
clinging
with
one
hand
contrived
to
reach
the
dog
collar
with
the
other
and
hold
him
up
what
she
would
have
done
next
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
he
was
too
heavy
to
lift
in
her
already
precarious
position
but
at
that
moment
a
gentleman
evidently
in
quest
of
his
pet
parted
the
hazel
boughs
and
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
hold
hard
a
moment
he
called
and
scrambling
down
the
bank
managed
to
make
a
long
arm
and
hook
his
stick
into
the
poodle
collar
and
drag
the
almost
strangled
creature
to
shore
until
rona
had
cautiously
wriggled
round
on
the
bough
and
crept
back
safely
the
spectators
watched
in
considerable
anxiety
they
need
not
have
been
alarmed
however
for
after
her
many
new
zealand
experiences
she
thought
this
a
very
poor
affair
the
owner
of
the
dog
shouted
his
thanks
from
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
and
disappeared
behind
the
high
hedge
the
whole
episode
had
not
taken
five
minutes
do
you
know
who
that
was
it
was
lord
glyncraig
said
addie
in
rather
awestruck
tones
was
it
well
i
sure
i
do
care
returned
rona
a
trifle
defiantly
i
have
saved
john
jones
dog
quite
as
readily
what
a
pity
he
did
ask
your
name
he
might
have
invited
you
to
tea
at
plas
cafn
then
you
have
scored
over
stephie
no
end
i
sure
i
do
want
to
go
to
tea
at
plas
cafn
thank
you
snapped
rona
rather
out
of
temper
but
think
of
the
fun
of
it
persisted
addie
i
only
wish
they
ask
me
they
wo
ask
any
of
us
so
what
the
use
of
talking
said
lizzie
let
go
back
to
the
others
it
must
be
time
for
lunch
they
found
the
rest
of
the
girls
seated
on
the
wall
as
being
the
driest
spot
available
and
already
attacking
their
packets
of
sandwiches
some
had
even
reached
the
stage
it
a
good
thing
we
each
got
our
own
private
basket
or
there
would
be
much
left
for
you
shouted
mary
acton
where
have
you
been
all
this
while
consorting
with
members
of
the
peerage
said
addie
airily
oh
yes
my
dear
girl
we
had
quite
what
you
might
call
a
confidential
talk
down
by
the
stream
with
lord
glyncraig
not
really
asked
stephanie
pricking
up
her
ears
really
and
truly
he
not
your
special
property
any
longer
rona
has
quite
supplanted
you
i
do
believe
it
you
ragging
stephanie
was
rather
pink
and
indignant
ask
the
others
if
you
want
to
know
no
one
was
particularly
sorry
to
take
a
rest
after
all
the
scrambling
the
lunch
tasted
good
and
the
last
tartlet
had
soon
disappeared
rona
perched
on
a
began
her
orange
and
tossed
long
yellow
strands
of
peel
on
to
the
bank
below
her
oh
stop
that
before
teddie
catches
you
urged
ulyth
but
she
was
too
late
for
miss
teddington
had
already
spied
the
offending
pieces
who
threw
those
she
demanded
then
rona
mitchell
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
go
and
pick
them
up
at
once
and
put
them
inside
your
basket
what
do
you
think
the
field
will
look
like
if
more
than
fifty
people
strew
it
with
and
we
do
come
here
to
spoil
the
beautiful
spots
we
have
been
enjoying
i
should
be
utterly
disgraced
if
the
school
behaved
like
a
party
of
woodlanders
ought
to
respect
all
natural
scenery
i
thought
you
would
have
learnt
that
by
this
time
but
it
appears
you
have
do
forget
it
again
much
crushed
rona
collected
the
peel
and
wrapping
it
carefully
in
her
piece
of
put
it
in
the
very
bottom
of
her
basket
under
a
layer
of
catkins
the
girls
had
brought
bobbins
of
thread
with
them
and
were
making
their
snowdrops
into
little
bunches
with
ivy
leaves
and
from
the
hazel
a
few
lucky
explorers
had
even
found
some
palm
opening
on
the
sallows
several
had
nature
notes
to
contribute
nellie
barlow
and
gladys
broughton
had
seen
a
real
weasel
and
plumed
themselves
accordingly
till
evie
isherwood
capped
their
story
by
producing
the
remains
of
a
last
year
chaffinch
nest
she
had
found
in
a
tree
if
i
said
i
seen
a
snake
should
i
be
believed
whispered
rona
certainly
not
everyone
knows
that
snakes
hibernate
so
do
try
it
on
returned
ulyth
laughing
two
we
must
be
going
back
at
once
girls
or
there
wo
be
time
to
send
off
your
snowdrops
said
miss
teddington
pack
your
baskets
and
come
along
chapter
x
trespassers
beware
the
girls
left
the
snowdrop
field
with
reluctance
though
they
realized
the
necessity
for
hurry
nearly
everyone
wished
to
dispatch
her
spoils
home
and
unless
the
boxes
were
sent
very
early
to
the
the
chances
were
that
there
would
not
be
time
for
the
postmaster
to
stamp
them
officially
and
that
they
might
languish
somewhere
in
the
background
of
the
village
shop
until
next
day
and
consequently
arrive
at
their
destination
in
an
utterly
withered
condition
the
school
scrambled
back
along
the
top
of
the
wall
therefore
with
what
haste
the
brambles
and
allowed
them
splashed
recklessly
among
the
pools
of
the
flooded
lane
and
regained
the
high
road
with
quite
record
speed
ulyth
walking
with
lizzie
lonsdale
had
left
rona
in
the
rear
rona
owing
to
her
intimacy
with
ulyth
tried
to
tag
on
to
v
b
often
receiving
snubs
from
some
of
its
members
her
own
were
all
considerably
younger
than
herself
at
first
they
had
teased
her
shamelessly
but
since
the
christmas
holidays
recognizing
that
she
was
gaining
a
more
established
position
in
the
school
they
had
begun
to
treat
her
more
mercifully
some
of
them
were
really
rather
jolly
children
and
though
twelve
seems
young
to
fourteen
the
poor
cuckoo
was
still
a
lonely
enough
bird
to
welcome
any
crumbs
of
friendship
thrown
in
her
way
at
the
present
moment
winnie
fowler
and
hattie
goodwin
were
clinging
to
her
arms
one
on
either
side
their
motives
i
fear
were
a
trifle
mixed
they
found
rona
amusing
and
liked
her
company
but
also
they
were
tired
and
found
if
they
dragged
a
little
she
would
pull
them
along
without
remonstrance
my
shoes
are
ever
so
wet
boasted
winnie
i
plumped
down
deep
in
the
lane
and
the
water
went
right
through
the
laces
at
the
top
it
squelches
as
i
walk
i
feel
like
a
soldier
in
the
trenches
i
torn
my
coat
in
three
places
said
hattie
not
to
be
outdone
it
will
be
a
nice
little
piece
of
work
for
johnson
to
mend
it
glad
they
do
make
us
mend
our
own
coats
here
grunted
winnie
miss
bowes
would
be
ashamed
to
see
me
in
it
if
i
did
hattie
chuckled
but
i
knitted
a
whole
sock
since
christmas
and
turned
the
heel
too
cuckoo
are
you
tired
not
a
scrap
replied
rona
who
was
stumping
along
sturdily
in
spite
of
her
encumbrances
well
i
am
i
wish
it
was
three
miles
back
it
not
more
than
two
as
the
crow
flies
but
we
not
crows
and
we
ca
fly
and
there
are
no
aeroplanes
to
give
us
a
lift
we
got
to
tramp
tramp
tramp
along
the
hard
high
road
i
begin
to
sympathize
with
tommies
on
the
march
why
need
we
stick
to
the
high
road
said
rona
pausing
suddenly
if
we
struck
across
country
we
save
a
mile
or
more
look
the
woodlands
is
over
there
and
if
we
made
a
beeline
for
it
we
cut
off
all
that
enormous
round
by
cefn
mawr
who
game
to
try
oh
i
am
if
we
can
dodge
teddie
likewise
this
child
added
winnie
oh
we
dodge
teddie
right
enough
it
will
be
good
scouting
practice
chuckled
rona
sit
down
on
that
stone
and
tie
your
shoelace
and
we
wait
for
you
while
the
others
go
on
then
we
bolt
through
that
gate
and
over
the
wall
into
the
next
field
the
idea
that
it
was
scouting
practice
lent
a
vestige
of
sanction
to
the
proceeding
winnie
took
the
hint
and
adjusted
her
shoelaces
with
elaborate
care
and
deliberation
do
be
all
day
over
that
said
miss
teddington
who
passed
by
but
did
not
wait
the
moment
she
was
round
the
corner
of
the
road
and
the
high
hedge
screened
her
from
view
the
three
deserters
were
through
the
gate
and
running
across
the
field
they
scaled
a
wall
without
much
difficulty
and
found
themselves
on
a
wide
pasture
though
they
could
not
now
see
the
chimneys
of
the
woodlands
in
the
distance
there
were
other
landmarks
quite
sufficient
to
guide
them
they
plodded
on
cheerfully
it
would
be
prime
to
have
our
snowdrops
all
packed
up
before
the
others
got
back
ventured
hattie
they
be
so
surprised
wonder
how
we
stolen
a
march
on
them
if
teddie
asks
where
we
were
we
can
truly
say
the
front
winnie
giggled
you
better
not
pick
up
any
nature
specimens
though
or
she
want
to
know
exact
locality
where
you
found
them
um
yes
that
might
be
awkward
this
toadstool
shall
stay
on
its
native
heath
in
case
it
tells
tales
it
was
rather
a
fascinating
walk
all
amongst
the
none
of
the
three
had
been
there
before
and
instinctively
the
younger
ones
left
rona
to
lead
the
way
her
bump
of
locality
had
been
well
developed
in
new
zealand
so
she
strode
on
with
confidence
but
the
ground
shelved
down
suddenly
revealing
a
natural
feature
upon
which
they
had
not
counted
a
fairly
wide
brook
running
between
sandy
banks
here
indeed
was
an
obstacle
winnie
and
hattie
stared
at
it
with
blank
faces
and
groaned
we
forgotten
the
wretched
llanelwyn
stream
what
atrocious
luck
do
believe
there
the
ghost
of
a
bridge
anywhere
shall
we
have
to
go
back
i
not
going
back
declared
rona
sturdily
there
must
be
some
way
of
getting
over
it
some
where
come
along
and
we
prospect
oh
for
the
wings
of
a
dove
sighed
hattie
even
those
of
the
raggedest
sparrow
would
be
welcome
better
wish
yourself
a
fish
for
you
may
have
to
try
swimming
grunted
winnie
i
ca
swim
not
a
stroke
you
suggest
i
shall
jump
it
next
i
suppose
look
here
we
shall
have
to
go
back
there
nothing
else
for
it
rona
corona
mitchell
corona
margarita
cuckoo
where
you
gone
to
coo
ee
came
in
reply
from
the
distance
and
presently
rona
appeared
beckoning
vigorously
we
going
back
shouted
hattie
no
no
come
along
here
anxious
to
see
if
she
had
found
any
solution
of
the
problem
the
others
pelted
down
a
slope
and
joined
her
here
our
bridge
said
rona
proudly
as
soon
as
they
rounded
the
corner
that
thing
exclaimed
winnie
looking
aghast
at
the
decidedly
slim
pole
that
was
fixed
across
the
stream
as
a
cattle
bar
i
not
a
dancer
thank
you
sneered
hattie
rather
indignantly
it
be
quite
easy
rona
urged
oh
i
dare
say
you
wo
find
me
trying
to
walk
across
it
i
can
tell
you
i
did
ask
you
to
walk
i
going
to
sit
on
it
like
a
tailor
and
shuffle
myself
over
it
broad
enough
for
that
i
go
first
oh
i
dare
i
drop
in
wailed
the
younger
ones
in
chorus
now
do
funk
what
two
sillies
you
are
it
wo
be
as
hard
as
you
think
just
watch
me
do
it
fortunately
the
pole
had
two
great
advantages
it
was
firmly
fixed
in
the
bank
on
either
side
so
that
it
did
not
sway
about
and
being
the
trunk
of
a
with
the
bark
still
left
on
its
surface
offered
some
grip
rona
progress
was
slow
but
steady
she
worked
herself
over
by
a
few
inches
at
a
time
when
she
reached
the
water
edge
on
the
far
side
she
dropped
on
to
a
patch
of
silver
sand
and
hurrahed
buck
up
and
come
along
she
yelled
lustily
this
was
scouting
with
a
vengeance
and
more
than
the
others
had
bargained
for
but
the
stronger
will
prevailed
and
though
they
shook
in
their
shoes
they
were
persuaded
to
make
the
experiment
i
all
dithering
panted
hattie
as
winnie
pushed
her
forward
to
try
first
it
was
not
as
bad
as
she
had
expected
she
was
able
to
cling
tightly
with
hands
and
knees
and
though
she
had
one
awful
moment
in
the
middle
when
she
thought
she
was
overbalancing
she
reached
rona
outstretched
hand
in
due
course
you
squealed
like
a
pig
said
the
cuckoo
i
thought
i
was
done
for
would
you
like
to
feel
how
my
beating
no
i
should
do
be
affected
come
along
win
we
ca
wait
all
day
i
fish
you
out
if
you
tumble
in
i
promise
you
it
is
deep
enough
to
drown
you
with
many
protestations
winnie
really
very
much
scared
followed
the
others
lead
and
got
along
quite
successfully
till
within
a
foot
of
the
brink
then
the
sudden
mooing
of
a
cow
on
the
bank
startled
her
and
so
upset
her
equilibrium
that
she
splashed
into
the
water
wetting
one
leg
thoroughly
ugh
my
shoes
were
squelchy
enough
before
she
lamented
you
think
how
horrid
it
is
never
mind
you
got
across
but
you
might
sympathize
have
time
we
shall
have
to
hurry
up
if
we
mean
to
be
back
before
the
others
did
you
think
the
cow
was
teddie
calling
you
laughed
hattie
who
having
got
her
own
trial
over
could
afford
to
jest
at
other
misfortunes
you
have
jumped
yourself
oh
dear
i
spilt
most
of
my
snowdrops
though
i
did
tie
the
basket
round
my
neck
never
mind
you
ca
fish
them
out
of
the
stream
now
i
give
you
some
of
mine
here
take
these
said
rona
i
nobody
to
send
them
to
she
added
half
to
herself
as
she
climbed
the
bank
oh
thanks
awfully
i
always
send
mother
a
big
bunch
she
looks
forward
to
them
i
brought
a
cardboard
box
from
home
on
purpose
to
pack
them
in
because
the
cook
runs
quite
out
of
some
of
the
girls
last
year
had
to
wrap
theirs
just
in
brown
paper
if
you
do
want
yours
can
you
spare
me
a
few
more
i
keep
just
these
to
put
in
my
bedroom
and
you
may
have
the
rest
if
you
like
replied
rona
stalking
ahead
every
now
and
then
the
sense
of
her
loneliness
smote
her
she
would
probably
be
the
only
girl
in
the
school
who
was
not
sending
flowers
away
how
different
it
would
be
if
she
had
anybody
in
england
who
took
an
interest
in
her
and
cared
to
receive
her
snowdrops
it
no
use
crying
for
the
moon
she
decided
blinking
hard
lest
she
should
betray
symptoms
of
weakness
before
her
juniors
when
a
thing
ca
be
helped
it
ca
and
there
an
end
of
it
cuckoo
corona
margarita
do
wait
for
us
you
walk
like
the
wind
or
as
if
a
bull
were
chasing
you
panted
hattie
overtaking
her
and
claiming
a
supporting
arm
do
you
see
where
we
got
ourselves
to
the
only
way
out
of
this
is
to
go
straight
through
the
glynmaen
wood
well
and
why
should
we
go
through
the
glynmaen
wood
is
it
any
different
to
any
other
wood
no
only
they
horribly
particular
about
trespassing
they
stick
up
all
kinds
of
notices
warning
people
off
what
rubbish
why
in
new
zealand
we
go
where
we
like
oh
i
dare
say
in
new
zealand
look
there
a
notice
up
there
said
winnie
pointing
over
the
hedge
to
a
tree
whereon
was
nailed
a
board
bearing
the
inhospitable
legend
trespassers
beware
rona
stared
at
it
quite
belligerently
i
should
like
to
pull
it
down
she
observed
what
right
has
anybody
to
try
to
keep
places
all
to
themselves
i
suppose
it
belongs
to
lord
glyncraig
all
the
more
shame
to
him
then
i
shall
take
a
particular
pleasure
in
going
just
because
he
sticks
up
suppose
we
caught
my
blessed
babes
you
do
suppose
i
come
all
this
short
cut
and
scrambled
over
a
pole
to
be
turned
back
by
a
trespass
notice
do
you
want
to
cross
the
stream
again
and
trail
home
by
the
road
rather
not
then
i
give
you
a
boost
to
get
over
the
fence
there
the
property
was
well
protected
it
took
rona
best
efforts
to
help
her
companions
to
scale
the
high
oak
boards
when
they
had
all
dropped
safely
to
the
other
side
they
set
off
through
the
trees
in
the
direction
they
judged
would
bring
them
out
nearest
to
the
woodlands
three
girls
in
thick
shoes
do
not
pass
absolutely
silently
through
a
wood
especially
if
they
indulge
in
giggles
winnie
and
hattie
moreover
could
never
be
together
without
chattering
incessantly
for
the
moment
they
had
forgotten
every
principle
of
scouting
in
that
quiet
secluded
spot
their
shrill
voices
rang
out
with
extreme
clearness
a
rabbit
or
two
scuttled
away
and
a
pheasant
flew
off
with
a
whirr
presently
another
and
heavier
pair
of
boots
might
be
heard
tramping
towards
them
the
bushes
parted
and
a
face
with
lantern
jaws
and
a
stubbly
chin
regarded
them
grimly
the
gamekeeper
glowered
a
moment
then
growled
out
what
are
you
three
here
that
our
own
business
retorted
rona
briskly
indeed
well
it
happens
to
be
my
business
too
you
trespassing
and
you
know
it
we
doing
no
harm
are
you
i
suppose
it
nothing
to
scare
every
pheasant
in
the
wood
oh
dear
no
what
nonsense
it
was
only
one
exclaimed
rona
standing
up
against
the
bullying
tone
you
making
the
most
unnecessary
fuss
what
right
have
you
to
stop
us
more
right
than
you
got
to
be
here
i
wo
have
anybody
in
these
woods
schoolgirls
or
no
schoolgirls
so
just
you
get
back
the
way
you
came
or
that
will
do
jordan
said
a
voice
behind
him
the
keeper
started
turned
and
touched
his
cap
obsequiously
beg
pardon
my
lord
but
the
trespassing
that
goes
on
here
gets
past
bearing
and
wants
putting
a
stop
to
very
well
i
settle
it
myself
and
lord
glyncraig
for
it
was
he
readjusted
his
glasses
and
stared
reprovingly
at
the
three
delinquents
ah
girls
from
the
woodlands
evidently
out
of
bounds
i
shall
have
to
report
you
to
your
headmistress
i
afraid
your
names
please
winnie
fowler
hattie
goodwin
murmured
two
subdued
voices
rona
did
not
answer
at
all
she
kept
her
head
down
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
it
it
surely
not
the
same
girl
who
did
me
such
a
service
this
morning
on
the
marsh
then
i
must
repeat
my
thanks
now
look
here
you
been
up
to
some
mischief
all
three
of
you
get
back
to
school
as
quick
as
you
can
and
i
say
nothing
about
it
there
off
you
go
without
another
word
the
sinners
pelted
along
through
the
wood
never
pausing
till
they
reached
the
railing
and
climbed
over
on
to
the
high
road
here
on
free
ground
they
felt
at
liberty
to
express
their
indignation
he
a
nasty
horrid
old
thing
to
turn
us
out
panted
hattie
how
he
looked
at
you
rona
said
winnie
he
stared
and
stared
and
stared
wondering
where
he
seen
me
before
i
suppose
i
expect
the
green
stains
on
my
coat
reminded
him
i
got
them
hauling
up
his
precious
dog
it
was
with
him
in
the
wood
oh
it
sitting
by
the
fire
drinking
linseed
tea
it
looked
a
pampered
brute
we
shall
have
to
scoot
to
keep
clear
of
teddie
all
right
thank
goodness
there
the
hedge
of
the
woodlands
we
slip
in
through
the
little
side
gate
the
three
certainly
merited
discovery
for
their
misdeeds
but
on
this
occasion
they
evaded
justice
for
as
luck
would
have
it
they
reached
the
house
just
a
moment
or
two
before
the
rest
of
the
school
and
miss
teddington
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
pack
her
boxes
of
snowdrops
concluded
that
they
must
have
been
in
front
with
ulyth
and
lizzie
and
did
not
stop
to
remember
that
she
had
left
them
tying
winnie
shoelace
by
the
roadside
it
was
seldom
that
such
a
palpable
lapse
escaped
her
keen
eye
and
even
keener
comprehension
so
they
might
thank
their
fortunate
stars
for
their
escape
hattie
and
winnie
made
great
capital
out
of
the
adventure
and
recounted
all
the
details
much
exaggerated
to
a
thrilled
audience
in
iv
rona
did
not
mention
the
matter
to
ulyth
perhaps
knowing
her
standards
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
was
rather
ashamed
of
it
chapter
xi
rona
receives
news
ulyth
and
lizzie
lonsdale
were
sitting
cosily
in
the
latter
bedroom
it
was
shrove
tuesday
and
with
perhaps
some
idea
of
imitating
the
continental
habit
of
keeping
carnival
miss
bowes
for
that
one
day
relaxed
her
rule
prohibiting
sweets
and
allowed
the
school
a
special
indulgence
needless
to
say
they
availed
themselves
of
it
to
the
fullest
extent
some
had
boxes
of
chocolate
sent
them
from
home
others
visited
the
village
shop
and
purchased
delicacies
from
the
big
bottles
displayed
in
the
windows
while
a
favoured
few
managed
to
borrow
pans
from
the
kitchen
and
perform
some
cookery
with
the
aid
of
friends
lizzie
had
been
concocting
peppermint
creams
and
she
now
leant
back
luxuriously
in
a
and
handed
the
box
to
ulyth
the
two
girls
were
friends
and
often
met
for
a
chat
ulyth
sometimes
wished
they
could
be
though
rona
was
immensely
improved
she
was
still
not
an
entirely
congenial
companion
her
lack
of
education
and
early
training
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
understand
half
the
things
ulyth
wanted
to
talk
about
and
it
was
troublesome
always
to
have
to
explain
in
an
equal
friendship
there
must
be
give
and
take
and
to
poor
rona
ulyth
was
constantly
giving
her
very
best
and
receiving
nothing
in
return
lizzie
on
the
contrary
was
inspiring
she
played
and
painted
well
was
fond
of
reading
and
was
ready
to
help
to
organize
any
forward
movement
in
the
school
she
and
ulyth
pottered
together
over
photography
mounted
specimens
for
the
museum
tried
new
stitches
in
embroidery
and
worked
at
the
same
patterns
in
chip
carving
the
two
girls
were
at
about
the
same
level
of
attainment
in
most
things
for
if
ulyth
had
greater
originality
lizzie
was
the
more
steady
and
plodding
it
was
ulyth
failing
to
take
things
up
very
hotly
at
first
and
then
grow
tired
of
them
she
was
apt
to
have
half
a
dozen
unfinished
pieces
of
fancywork
on
hand
and
her
locker
in
the
held
several
ambitious
attempts
that
had
never
reached
fruition
lizzie
as
she
munched
her
peppermint
creams
turned
over
the
pages
of
a
volume
of
dryden
poems
and
made
an
occasional
note
each
form
kept
a
calendar
of
quotations
hung
up
in
its
classroom
the
daily
extracts
for
which
were
supplied
by
the
girls
in
rotation
it
was
lizzie
turn
to
provide
the
gems
for
the
following
week
and
she
was
hunting
for
something
suitable
i
wish
miss
bowes
had
given
me
shakespeare
she
said
i
could
have
got
heaps
of
bits
out
of
my
just
suitable
for
the
month
too
i
do
know
why
she
should
have
pitched
on
dryden
no
one
going
to
be
particularly
cheered
next
week
with
my
quotations
i
got
i
consider
life
is
all
a
cheat
yet
fooled
with
hope
men
favour
the
deceit
trust
on
and
think
will
repay
falser
than
the
former
day
human
things
are
subject
to
decay
and
when
fate
summons
monarchs
must
obey
that
dismal
in
all
conscience
put
in
ulyth
wits
are
sure
to
madness
near
allied
and
thin
partitions
do
their
bounds
divide
that
sounds
quite
as
dismal
does
it
not
i
wonder
why
scott
calls
dryden
john
i
think
he
rather
a
dismal
poet
listen
to
this
dreams
they
fearful
precipices
tread
or
shipwrecked
labour
to
some
distant
shore
or
in
dark
churches
walk
amongst
the
dead
they
wake
with
horror
and
dare
sleep
no
more
shall
i
put
it
down
for
thursday
for
goodness
sake
do
you
give
us
all
the
creeps
laughed
ulyth
well
it
wo
be
a
champion
week
i
tell
you
what
you
might
do
draw
some
illustrations
round
the
mottoes
that
would
make
them
more
interesting
oh
i
dare
say
i
have
time
to
bother
nonsense
you
have
i
do
some
of
them
for
you
you
need
be
original
it
does
take
long
to
copy
things
will
you
do
four
then
if
i
do
three
all
serene
i
begin
this
evening
if
you
give
me
the
cards
ulyth
dashed
off
quite
a
pretty
little
sketch
in
ten
minutes
after
tea
and
put
the
cards
by
in
her
drawer
intending
to
finish
them
during
handicraft
hour
the
next
day
but
she
completely
forgot
all
about
them
and
never
remembered
their
existence
till
saturday
when
she
came
across
them
by
accident
and
was
much
dismayed
at
her
discovery
i
have
to
do
them
somehow
or
lizzie
never
forgive
me
she
ruminated
i
must
knock
them
off
just
as
fast
as
i
can
i
could
copy
those
little
figures
from
the
they
in
outline
and
will
be
very
easy
oh
bother
it
cataloguing
day
and
one
not
supposed
to
use
the
library
what
atrocious
luck
twice
during
the
term
the
books
of
the
school
library
were
called
in
for
purposes
of
review
by
the
librarian
and
on
those
days
nobody
was
allowed
to
borrow
any
of
the
volumes
it
was
most
unfortunate
for
ulyth
that
this
special
saturday
should
be
the
one
devoted
by
the
monitresses
to
the
purpose
she
had
failed
lizzie
so
often
before
in
their
joint
projects
that
she
did
not
wish
to
encounter
fresh
reproaches
somehow
three
illustrations
had
to
be
provided
and
that
within
the
space
of
about
half
an
hour
ulyth
was
fairly
clever
at
drawing
but
she
was
not
capable
of
producing
the
pictures
out
of
her
head
she
must
obtain
a
copy
and
that
quickly
helen
cooper
librarian
this
month
she
thought
i
wonder
if
finished
checking
the
catalogue
yet
i
saw
her
walking
down
the
stream
five
minutes
ago
with
mabel
hoyle
why
should
i
have
the
for
half
an
hour
it
would
do
any
harm
it
really
is
the
merest
red
tape
that
we
may
use
the
books
i
shall
just
take
french
leave
and
borrow
it
ulyth
went
at
once
to
the
library
helen
had
evidently
been
at
work
there
for
the
list
lay
open
with
a
sheet
of
paper
near
recording
the
condition
of
some
of
the
copies
a
and
some
rolls
of
transparent
gummed
edging
showed
that
helen
had
been
busy
mending
battered
covers
and
torn
pages
she
probably
meant
to
finish
them
after
tea
the
book
of
american
gems
was
in
its
usual
place
on
the
shelf
the
temptation
was
irresistible
ulyth
did
not
notice
as
she
was
taking
it
down
that
someone
with
a
smooth
head
of
sleek
fair
hair
was
peeping
round
the
corner
of
the
door
and
that
a
pair
of
not
too
friendly
blue
eyes
were
watching
the
deed
if
flying
footsteps
whisked
along
the
corridor
and
out
into
the
garden
she
was
blissfully
unconscious
of
the
fact
she
took
the
volume
to
her
own
and
settled
herself
at
her
desk
with
her
drawing
materials
cardboard
pencil
fine
pen
and
a
bottle
of
indian
ink
the
little
figures
were
exactly
what
she
wanted
quite
simple
in
outline
but
most
effective
and
not
at
all
difficult
they
would
certainly
improve
lizzie
calendar
for
the
week
and
relieve
the
sombre
character
of
the
dryden
quotations
she
worked
away
very
rapidly
sketching
them
lightly
in
pencil
intending
to
finish
them
in
ink
afterwards
she
grew
quite
interested
especially
when
she
reached
the
pen
part
that
little
face
with
its
laughing
mouth
and
aureole
of
hair
was
really
very
pretty
she
had
copied
it
without
having
to
use
the
once
ulyth
stanton
what
are
you
doing
with
that
book
said
a
voice
from
behind
her
desk
beside
her
stood
helen
cooper
and
stephanie
radford
the
former
hugely
indignant
the
latter
with
a
expression
ulyth
started
so
violently
that
the
bottle
of
indian
ink
overturned
and
spread
itself
out
in
three
streams
oh
jemima
shrieked
ulyth
in
consternation
now
you
done
it
exclaimed
helen
angrily
ink
all
over
the
page
what
a
disgraceful
mess
for
goodness
sake
stop
you
making
it
worse
give
it
to
me
ulyth
who
was
frantically
mopping
up
the
black
streams
with
her
pocket
handkerchief
surrendered
the
book
to
the
outraged
librarian
nemesis
had
indeed
descended
upon
her
guilty
head
you
knew
perfectly
well
that
you
were
allowed
to
take
it
scolded
helen
you
sneaked
into
the
library
and
got
it
while
i
was
out
someone
else
has
been
sneaking
too
thought
ulyth
with
a
glance
at
stephanie
face
i
fancy
i
know
who
turned
informer
then
aloud
she
said
i
fearfully
sorry
i
buy
a
new
copy
of
the
book
i
do
believe
you
can
it
one
arnold
gave
to
the
school
and
is
published
in
america
i
try
sponging
it
with
salts
of
lemon
but
i
afraid
nothing
will
take
out
the
stain
i
thought
better
of
you
ulyth
stanton
one
does
expect
such
things
from
v
b
you
borrow
no
more
books
till
the
end
of
the
month
do
you
understand
ulyth
responded
with
what
meekness
she
could
muster
she
admitted
that
the
monitress
had
reason
for
wrath
and
that
she
had
really
no
excuse
worthy
of
urging
in
extenuation
of
her
crime
it
was
hard
to
be
debarred
the
use
of
the
library
for
more
than
a
fortnight
but
helen
she
knew
would
enforce
that
discipline
rigidly
the
unfortunate
had
come
in
for
the
bulk
of
the
ink
and
were
completely
spoilt
ulyth
carried
the
ruins
to
lizzie
bedroom
and
pleaded
well
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
i
done
my
three
cards
with
pictures
of
flowers
and
the
rest
of
the
calendar
will
have
to
be
plain
said
lizzie
you
were
rather
an
idiot
ulyth
i
know
i
have
asked
helen
for
the
book
if
she
been
anywhere
near
and
i
meant
to
tell
her
afterwards
that
i
taken
it
did
you
explain
that
to
her
no
it
did
come
well
when
she
just
caught
me
you
let
her
think
the
worst
of
you
it
could
be
helped
i
sure
stephanie
hunted
her
up
and
told
her
stephanie
does
like
you
no
because
i
champion
rona
and
stephanie
ca
bear
her
there
nothing
so
much
wrong
with
the
poor
old
cuckoo
now
wonderfully
inoffensive
yes
but
she
not
aristocratic
stephie
rubs
that
in
to
her
continually
she
calls
her
daughter
of
the
people
stephanie
radford
can
be
uncommonly
snobbish
sometimes
stephanie
from
the
very
first
had
resented
rona
presence
at
the
woodlands
and
since
the
practical
joke
which
the
latter
had
played
upon
her
she
had
disliked
her
heartily
she
lost
no
opportunity
of
showing
her
contempt
and
of
trying
to
make
rona
seem
of
small
account
she
revived
an
ancient
tradition
of
the
school
which
made
it
a
breach
of
etiquette
for
girls
to
go
into
other
than
their
own
thus
banishing
rona
from
v
b
where
she
had
often
been
brought
in
by
ulyth
or
addie
to
share
the
fun
that
went
on
if
obliged
to
take
rona
hand
in
she
would
only
give
the
extreme
tips
of
her
fingers
and
if
forced
on
any
occasion
to
sit
next
to
her
she
would
draw
away
her
skirts
as
if
she
feared
contamination
the
woodlands
is
what
it
used
to
be
she
would
assure
a
select
circle
of
listeners
when
my
eldest
sister
was
here
there
were
the
courtenays
and
the
derringtons
and
the
vernons
and
quite
a
number
of
girls
of
really
good
family
miss
bowes
would
never
have
dreamt
then
of
taking
a
girl
she
knew
nothing
about
she
was
so
particular
whom
she
received
the
poor
old
cuckoo
has
her
points
volunteered
addie
i
afraid
most
of
us
are
all
schools
are
more
mixed
than
they
used
to
be
admitted
stephanie
candidly
but
i
draw
the
line
at
specimens
straight
from
the
backwoods
few
of
the
girls
really
liked
stephanie
nevertheless
her
opinions
carried
weight
a
who
dresses
well
talks
continually
of
highborn
friends
and
gives
herself
airs
can
nearly
always
command
a
certain
following
among
the
more
unthinking
of
her
comrades
and
such
girls
as
beth
broadway
alice
and
merle
denham
and
mary
acton
were
easily
impressed
by
stephanie
attitude
of
superiority
and
ready
to
follow
her
lead
on
a
question
of
caste
it
gave
them
a
kind
of
reflected
credit
to
belong
to
stephanie
circle
and
they
liked
to
pride
themselves
upon
their
exclusiveness
though
rona
was
many
thousand
miles
away
from
her
home
she
evidently
did
not
forget
her
new
zealand
friends
and
looked
out
anxiously
for
the
thin
foreign
letters
which
arrived
from
time
to
time
she
never
showed
them
to
anybody
and
spoke
little
of
old
associations
but
a
word
would
slip
out
here
and
there
to
reveal
that
she
cared
more
than
she
would
give
her
schoolfellows
to
suppose
one
afternoon
shortly
before
the
new
zealand
mail
was
expected
rona
was
working
in
her
portion
of
the
garden
when
mary
acton
brought
her
a
message
some
visitors
to
see
you
they
waiting
in
the
announced
mary
visitors
to
see
me
exclaimed
rona
throwing
down
her
rake
whoever
can
they
be
i
sure
i
do
know
replied
mary
stolidly
they
asked
for
miss
mitchell
so
i
suppose
that
you
there
is
anyone
else
in
the
school
named
mitchell
it
must
be
me
rona
eyes
were
wide
with
excitement
visitors
for
herself
it
was
such
an
utter
surprise
for
one
moment
a
wild
idea
flashed
across
her
mind
her
face
suddenly
hardened
what
are
they
like
do
you
know
them
she
gasped
not
from
adam
or
rather
eve
they
just
two
very
females
much
agitated
rona
flew
into
the
house
to
wash
her
hands
slip
off
her
and
change
her
shoes
when
this
very
hasty
toilet
was
completed
she
walked
to
the
and
entered
nervously
two
ladies
were
sitting
near
the
piano
with
their
backs
to
the
window
they
were
not
fashionably
dressed
but
perhaps
they
were
cold
for
both
wore
their
large
coat
collars
turned
up
their
felt
hats
had
wide
floppy
brims
one
carried
a
guide
to
north
wales
and
the
other
held
an
open
in
her
hand
as
if
she
had
been
studying
the
route
miss
mitchell
how
do
said
the
taller
of
the
two
as
rona
entered
i
dare
say
you
be
surprised
to
see
us
and
you
wo
know
who
we
are
i
grant
and
this
is
my
cousin
miss
smith
we
live
in
new
zealand
and
know
some
of
your
friends
there
we
visiting
england
at
present
and
as
we
found
ourselves
motoring
through
north
wales
we
thought
we
would
call
and
see
you
it
very
good
of
you
faltered
rona
which
friends
of
mine
do
you
know
the
higsons
they
sent
you
all
kinds
of
messages
oh
how
are
they
do
tell
me
about
them
rona
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
lips
quivering
pamela
has
grown
of
course
connie
and
minnie
have
had
measles
billy
had
a
fall
from
his
horse
and
sprained
his
ankle
badly
but

and
jake

most
of
his
time
with
the
johnson
girls
who
are
they
i
never
heard
of
them
they
came
after
you
left
to
which
farm
oh
not
very
far
away
i
believe
i
wonder
pamela
did
tell
me
all
that
in
her
letter
which
farm
can
it
possibly
be
surely
not
heathlands
i
believe
that
was
the
name
then
have
the
marstons
gone
yes
to
the
north
island
oh
i
very
sorry
why
did
they
write
to
me
did
you
hear
any
other
news
please
pamela
told
me
something
about
your
home
a
shadow
crossed
rona
face
is
it
is
it
mrs
barker
she
asked
nervously
yes
it
about
her
what
has
she
been
doing
getting
married
again
oh
oh
who
would
have
her
your
father
no
shrieked
rona
her
eyes
ablaze
it
ca
be
that
dreadful
drinking
woman
oh
i
ca
i
wo
believe
it
she
your
stepmother
now
whether
you
like
it
or
not
daddy
daddy
it
ca
be
how
could
you
you
knew
she
drank
he
drinking
himself
like
a
fish
no
my
daddy
rona
a
moment
ago
furious
had
turned
white
as
a
ghost
she
put
out
a
trembling
hand
and
clutched
the
piano
blindly
then
with
a
pitiful
broken
cry
she
fell
on
to
the
floor
at
that
moment
ulyth
with
her
entered
the
room
what
the
matter
rona
rona
dear
are
you
ill
who
are
these
people
she
might
well
ask
for
the
behaviour
of
the
two
strangers
was
most
unprecedented
they
were
leaning
on
each
other
shoulders
and
roaring
with
laughter
one
of
them
suddenly
threw
up
her
hat
and
turned
down
her
collar
revealing
the
familiar
features
of
stephanie
radford
done
you
brown
she
exploded
paid
you
back
in
your
own
coin
for
your
precious
eau
de
venus
sell
i
even
with
you
now
rona
mitchell
come
along
beth
and
the
pair
disappeared
guffawing
rona
picked
herself
up
shakily
and
subsided
on
to
a
chair
with
her
face
in
her
hands
it
not
true
then
she
quavered
what
is
true
they
told
me
dad
had
married
barker
and
that
he
was
drinking
stephanie
told
you
that
yes
oh
i
queer
still
rona
darling
of
course
it
nothing
but
a
black
wicked
lie
cry
so
there
is
a
word
of
truth
about
it
they
were
only
ragging
you
oh
do
take
it
so
hard
i
settle
with
stephanie
for
this
half
an
hour
afterwards
a
very
grim
determined
ulyth
supported
by
lizzie
lonsdale
sought
out
the
masqueraders
and
spoke
her
mind
she
ragged
me
so
why
should
i
turn
the
tables
on
her
it
nothing
to
make
such
a
hullabaloo
about
yapped
stephanie
but
it
is
the
trick
she
played
on
you
was
only
fun
after
all
yours
was
the
cruellest
thing
you
could
think
of
to
hurt
and
wound
her
you
may
pride
yourself
on
your
family
stephanie
radford
but
i
sure
the
very
commonest
person
would
have
had
nicer
feelings
than
to
do
this
i
can
never
think
the
same
of
you
and
beth
again
oh
of
course
you
take
up
the
cudgels
for
your
precious
cuckoo
snapped
stephanie
do
make
such
an
absurd
fuss
i
shall
do
what
i
like
without
you
setting
yourself
up
to
lecture
me
so
there
if
you
do
like
it
you
may
lump
it
not
a
very
aristocratic
form
of
expression
for
a
scion
of
the
radfords
of
stoke
radford
commented
lizzie
as
she
and
ulyth
stalked
away
chapter
xii
sentry
duty
the
spring
term
wore
slowly
on
march
winds
came
and
went
taking
the
sweet
violets
with
them
but
leaving
golden
lent
lilies
and
a
wealth
of
primroses
as
a
legacy
to
april
the
larch
forest
above
porth
powys
was
a
tangle
of
green
tassels
the
hedgerows
were
starry
with
blackthorn
and
the
over
the
windows
was
a
mass
of
rosy
blossom
spring
was
always
a
delightful
season
at
the
woodlands
with
the
longer
days
came
rambles
and
greater
freedom
popular
opinion
ran
high
in
extolling
country
life
and
any
girl
who
ventured
to
prefer
town
pleasures
found
herself
entirely
in
the
minority
rona
had
several
invitations
for
the
easter
holidays
one
from
stanton
among
the
number
but
miss
bowes
thinking
it
better
for
ulyth
to
have
a
rest
from
her
presence
decided
in
favour
of
winnie
fowler
ulyth
could
not
help
feeling
a
sense
of
relief
that
the
matter
was
thus
settled
rona
was
very
little
trouble
to
her
now
indeed
she
rather
liked
her
company
but
she
would
be
glad
to
have
her
mother
to
herself
for
the
few
short
weeks
i
would
for
the
world
have
tried
to
stop
her
coming
motherkins
she
wrote
home
but
miss
bowes
said
most
emphatically
that
she
must
go
to
the
fowlers
i
sure
they
give
her
a
good
time
and
well
i
admit
it
will
be
a
rest
to
me
just
at
present
i
do
want
to
share
you
now
you
know
the
whole
of
your
horrid
daughter
lizzie
asked
me
if
i
would
spend
part
of
the
holidays
with
her
but
i
managed
to
make
an
excuse
i
felt
i
could
spare
a
single
precious
day
away
from
you
i
have
so
much
to
talk
about
and
tell
you
am
i
greedy
but
what
the
use
of
having
one
own
lovely
mother
if
she
is
just
one
ownest
sometimes
i
tell
you
things
i
would
tell
anyone
else
on
earth
i
do
think
all
the
girls
feel
quite
the
same
but
then
their
mothers
ca
possibly
be
like
mine
she
the
one
in
a
thousand
i
sitting
up
late
in
my
bedroom
to
write
this
and
i
shall
have
to
report
myself
to
miss
lodge
but
i
felt
i
must
write
after
the
easter
holidays
everybody
returned
to
the
woodlands
prepared
to
make
the
most
of
the
coming
term
with
the
longer
evenings
more
time
was
allowed
and
the
glade
by
the
stream
became
a
kind
of
summer
parlour
those
girls
who
had
some
slight
skill
in
carpentry
constructed
rustic
benches
and
tables
from
the
boughs
blown
down
by
last
autumn
storms
and
those
who
preferred
nature
untouched
by
art
had
their
favourite
seats
in
snug
corners
among
the
bushes
or
on
the
stones
by
the
with
the
first
burst
of
warm
weather
bathing
was
allowed
and
every
morning
detachments
of
figures
in
mackintoshes
and
might
be
seen
wending
their
way
towards
the
large
pool
to
indulge
in
the
exhilarating
delight
of
a
dip
in
clear
flowing
water
followed
by
a
brisk
run
round
the
glade
these
expeditions
were
immensely
appreciated
the
girls
willingly
got
up
earlier
for
the
purpose
and
anyone
who
manifested
a
disposition
to
remain
in
bed
was
denounced
as
a
slacker
one
day
towards
the
end
of
may
when
some
of
the
members
of
v
b
were
sitting
with
their
fancywork
on
the
short
grass
under
an
addie
knighton
came
from
the
house
and
joined
them
there
was
beaming
satisfaction
in
addie
twinkling
grey
eyes
she
rubbed
her
hands
ostentatiously
and
chuckled
audibly
what
to
do
addie
old
girl
you
looking
very
smug
said
lizzie
aha
would
you
like
to
know
what
you
give
me
if
i
tell
you
now
never
buy
pigs
in
pokes
it
may
be
important
at
all
volunteered
merle
oh
indeed
is
it
just
wait
till
you
hear
it
nothing
but
one
of
your
sells
yawned
gertrude
oliver
moving
so
as
to
rest
her
back
more
comfortably
against
ulyth
arnold
does
generally
spring
sells
upon
us
ulyth
jumped
up
so
suddenly
that
gertrude
collapsed
with
a
squeal
of
protest
arnold
here
and
i
never
knew
where
is
she
do
excite
yourself
she
gone
by
now
she
only
stayed
ten
minutes
to
see
miss
bowes
but
it
was
ten
minutes
to
some
purpose
do
you
know
what
she
actually
proposed
addie
listeners
were
as
eager
now
as
they
had
been
languid
before
go
ahead
ca
you
urged
lizzie
well
the
whole
school
to
go
camping
for
three
days
this
indeed
was
news
stunning
spiffing
ripping
scrumptious
burst
in
a
chorus
from
the
elated
four
details
please
added
ulyth
when
and
where
and
how
and
why
is
it
a
business
asked
lizzie
of
course
it
is
or
arnold
would
be
getting
it
up
it
happened
this
way
the
llangarmon
and
elwyn
bay
detachments
of
boy
scouts
are
to
camp
at
llyn
gwynedd
for
ten
days
early
in
june
arnold
has
the
arranging
of
it
all
and
arnold
suggested
that
the
tents
might
just
as
easily
be
hired
a
few
days
sooner
and
we
could
use
them
before
the
boys
came
it
such
a
splendid
opportunity
it
would
be
too
expensive
to
have
everything
sent
down
on
purpose
just
for
us
but
when
there
we
can
hire
the
camp
for
very
little
extra
it
the
carriage
and
erecting
that
cost
so
much
miss
bowes
i
believe
hummed
and
a
little
but
teddie
just
tumbled
to
the
idea
and
persuaded
the
rainbow
to
clinch
it
good
old
teddie
i
believe
it
the
tragedy
of
her
life
that
she
live
altogether
in
the
open
air
she
adores
red
cross
work
the
teachers
are
all
to
come
to
camp
they
as
excited
as
you
please
about
it
it
was
miss
lodge
who
told
me
that
arnold
was
here
and
i
rushed
down
the
drive
and
caught
her
just
for
a
second
this
indeed
was
an
event
in
the
annals
of
the
school
never
since
the
league
was
started
had
its
members
found
any
opportunity
of
sampling
life
under
canvas
they
had
practised
a
little
camp
cookery
down
by
the
stream
but
their
experiments
had
not
gone
much
farther
than
frying
eggs
and
bacon
or
roasting
potatoes
in
hot
ashes
and
they
were
yearning
to
try
their
hands
at
gipsies
stews
and
gallipot
soups
with
arnold
for
leader
they
expected
a
three
days
elysium
even
miss
teddington
they
knew
would
rise
to
the
occasion
and
play
trumps
llyn
gwynedd
was
a
small
lonely
lake
about
six
miles
away
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
beyond
penllwyd
and
glyder
garmon
it
was
reached
from
the
woodlands
by
a
track
across
the
moors
but
it
communicated
by
high
road
with
capelcefn
station
so
that
tents
and
provisions
could
be
sent
up
by
a
the
ground
was
hired
from
a
local
farmer
who
undertook
to
supply
milk
butter
and
eggs
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
to
bring
meat
and
fresh
vegetables
from
capelcefn
as
required
to
cater
for
a
whole
school
up
in
the
wilds
is
a
task
from
which
many
principals
would
shrink
and
miss
bowes
might
be
forgiven
if
she
had
at
first
demurred
at
the
suggestion
but
with
practical
experience
to
help
her
she
gave
her
orders
and
embarked
not
without
a
few
tremors
upon
the
proceeding
if
the
mountain
air
makes
you
so
hungry
you
eat
up
two
days
provisions
in
one
it
means
you
have
to
fast
on
the
third
day
she
assured
the
girls
i
sending
up
what
i
hope
will
be
sufficient
it
like
victualling
a
regiment
of
course
we
sha
go
at
all
if
it
wet
arnold
who
very
kindly
volunteered
to
see
that
the
camp
was
properly
set
up
and
in
thorough
working
order
before
the
school
took
possession
superintended
the
erection
of
the
tents
and
reported
that
all
was
in
condition
and
only
waiting
for
its
battalion
on
june
therefore
a
very
jolly
procession
started
off
from
the
woodlands
in
navy
skirts
and
sports
coats
tricolor
ties
straw
hats
and
decorated
with
numerous
badges
and
small
flags
the
girls
felt
like
a
regiment
of
female
territorials
each
carried
her
kit
on
her
back
in
a
knapsack
containing
her
few
personal
necessities
and
knife
spoon
fork
and
enamelled
tin
mug
a
band
of
tin
whistles
and
mouth
organs
led
the
way
playing
a
valiant
attempt
at
caller
herrin
the
teachers
also
were
prepared
for
business
miss
teddington
who
had
done
climbs
in
switzerland
came
in
orthodox
costume
with
nailed
boots
and
a
jaunty
tyrolean
hat
with
a
piece
of
edelweiss
stuck
in
the
front
miss
lodge
wore
a
leather
coat
and
felt
hat
in
which
she
looked
ready
to
defy
a
waterspout
or
a
tornado
miss
moseley
who
owned
to
an
terror
of
bulls
grasped
an
and
miss
davis
had
a
first
aid
wallet
slung
across
her
back
in
the
opinion
miss
bowes
shirked
abominably
instead
of
venturing
on
the
walk
she
had
caught
the
morning
train
to
capelcefn
and
was
going
to
hire
a
car
at
the
royal
hotel
and
drive
up
to
the
lake
with
the
provisions
arnold
who
with
her
husband
had
taken
rooms
at
the
farm
for
a
few
days
was
already
on
the
spot
and
would
be
ready
to
receive
the
travellers
when
they
arrived
on
the
whole
it
was
a
glorious
morning
though
a
few
clouds
lingered
like
a
round
penllwyd
larks
were
singing
cuckoos
calling
bluebells
made
the
woods
seem
a
reflection
of
the
sky
and
the
gorse
was
ablaze
on
the
common
the
walk
was
at
first
up
up
up
climbing
a
steep
track
between
walls
taking
a
short
cut
over
the
slope
that
formed
the
spur
of
cwm
dinas
and
scaling
the
rocky
little
precipice
of
maenceirion
some
who
had
started
at
a
great
rate
and
with
much
enthusiasm
began
to
slacken
speed
and
to
realize
the
wisdom
of
miss
teddington
advice
and
try
the
steady
pace
she
had
learned
from
swiss
guides
you
ca
keep
it
up
if
you
begin
with
such
a
spurt
she
assured
them
alpine
climbing
has
to
be
like
the
tortoise
slow
and
sure
once
on
the
plateau
beyond
cwm
dinas
progress
was
easier
it
was
still
uphill
but
the
slope
was
gentler
they
were
on
the
open
moors
now
following
a
path
little
more
than
a
sheep
track
that
led
under
the
crag
of
glyder
garmon
except
for
an
occasional
tiny
whitewashed
farm
they
were
far
from
human
habitations
and
the
only
signs
of
life
were
the
small
agile
welsh
sheep
the
ponies
that
grazed
on
these
uplands
during
the
summer
months
and
a
pair
of
carrion
crows
that
wheeled
away
croaking
hoarsely
at
the
sight
of
intruders
on
and
on
over
what
seemed
an
interminable
reach
of
coarse
grass
and
jumping
tiny
brooks
and
skirting
round
sometimes
to
avoid
bogs
for
much
of
the
ground
was
spongy
and
though
its
surface
of
sphagnum
moss
looked
inviting
it
was
treacherous
in
the
extreme
at
last
they
had
rounded
the
corner
of
glyder
garmon
and
there
far
away
to
the
right
like
a
sheet
of
silver
llyn
gwynedd
lay
gleaming
in
the
distance
the
sight
of
their
destination
even
though
it
was
two
miles
away
cheered
up
those
weaker
spirits
that
were
beginning
to
lag
especially
as
something
white
on
the
south
side
when
examined
through
miss
teddington
proved
to
be
the
tents
of
an
hour
brisk
walking
brought
them
to
the
lake
and
in
ten
minutes
more
they
were
announcing
their
approach
to
the
camp
in
a
succession
of
wild
hoorays
and
arnold
were
waiting
to
do
the
honours
and
parading
in
their
very
best
style
the
league
marched
in
and
took
possession
by
the
time
they
had
been
two
hours
at
llyn
gwynedd
all
the
girls
felt
like
old
campers
arnold
was
no
novice
and
at
once
assumed
her
post
as
leader
and
captain
in
command
miss
bowes
miss
teddington
and
the
other
teachers
were
assigned
tents
of
honour
and
every
member
of
the
league
was
placed
on
definite
duty
some
were
cooks
some
some
scullions
and
some
sentries
according
to
their
qualifications
and
the
rank
they
held
in
the
league
the
field
hired
for
the
had
been
carefully
chosen
it
was
on
the
far
side
of
the
lake
away
from
the
road
sheltered
on
the
north
and
east
by
mountain
ridges
and
with
a
shelving
beach
of
fine
silvery
sand
where
the
waves
lapped
in
gentle
little
ripples
a
narrow
brook
leaping
from
the
heights
above
passed
through
the
centre
and
gave
a
quite
uncontaminated
water
supply
all
around
rose
peaks
which
had
not
been
visible
at
the
woodlands
the
rough
splintered
crest
of
craig
mawr
the
smoother
summit
of
pencastell
and
the
almost
inaccessible
precipice
of
carnedd
powys
it
was
glorious
to
sit
by
the
lake
and
feel
that
they
were
not
obliged
to
return
to
school
before
dark
but
could
stay
and
watch
the
sun
set
behind
pencastell
and
the
gloaming
creep
quietly
on
of
course
everybody
wanted
to
explore
the
immediate
vicinity
and
little
bands
each
in
charge
of
a
were
allowed
to
skirt
round
the
lake
within
sight
of
the
camp
each
girl
had
her
league
whistle
and
knew
the
signals
which
meant
danger
and
return
instantly
to
camp
these
had
been
rehearsed
in
the
glade
at
the
woodlands
and
formed
part
of
the
examination
of
every
candidate
ulyth
as
a
was
able
to
head
a
party
and
started
off
in
quest
of
bog
myrtle
along
the
bank
returning
with
great
armfuls
of
the
aromatic
shrub
to
cast
into
the
fire
during
the
evening
stunt
the
gathering
of
the
league
that
night
was
a
memorable
occasion
the
ceremonies
were
observed
with
strictest
formality
and
as
visitors
were
present
a
special
welcome
song
was
sung
in
their
honour
the
scene
was
immensely
picturesque
and
romantic
the
red
sun
setting
between
craig
mawr
and
pencastell
threw
a
last
glow
on
the
lake
the
blazing
fire
lighted
up
the
camp
and
the
rows
of
eager
faces
and
behind
all
was
the
background
of
the
eternal
hills
rona
having
successfully
passed
through
her
probation
was
admitted
as
a
and
awarded
the
white
badge
of
service
several
younger
girls
also
received
initiation
into
membership
with
the
league
ceremonial
songs
stories
and
the
evening
passed
very
swiftly
away
at
nine
everybody
was
expected
to
turn
in
a
night
under
canvas
was
a
new
experience
the
and
the
clean
blankets
looked
inviting
strict
military
discipline
was
observed
in
the
camp
and
sentries
were
told
off
on
duty
in
as
perfect
order
as
a
regiment
the
girls
went
to
their
tents
ulyth
was
sharing
quarters
with
addie
lizzie
and
gertrude
she
tucked
herself
up
in
her
blankets
as
she
had
been
taught
at
camp
drill
and
then
lay
quietly
for
a
long
long
time
watching
the
patch
of
sky
through
the
tent
door
she
seemed
only
to
have
been
asleep
for
about
an
hour
when
the
patrol
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
instantly
she
sprang
up
broad
awake
relieve
sentry
at
west
guard
was
the
order
and
the
patrol
passed
on
it
was
too
dark
to
see
her
watch
but
ulyth
knew
it
must
be
nearly
one
she
hastily
donned
the
warm
garments
ordered
to
be
worn
by
sentries
and
hurried
away
to
relieve
helen
cooper
her
post
was
at
the
west
end
of
the
camp
where
the
field
merged
into
a
rushy
swamp
before
it
rose
into
the
hill
that
led
towards
the
farm
the
password
is
said
helen
retiring
not
at
all
sorry
to
seek
the
comfort
of
her
bed
one
leg
of
the
is
most
rickety
so
i
warn
you
not
to
lean
too
hard
on
it
good
night
left
alone
ulyth
sat
down
with
extreme
caution
on
the
deficient
and
surveyed
the
situation
there
were
clouds
across
a
waning
moon
and
it
was
fairly
dark
she
could
see
the
outlines
of
the
tents
in
black
masses
behind
her
in
front
the
field
lay
dim
and
shadowy
with
a
mist
creeping
from
the
water
up
above
to
her
right
against
an
indigo
sky
the
great
bear
was
standing
almost
on
its
head
with
its
tail
in
the
air
one
of
the
tests
of
a
was
a
knowledge
of
the
stars
and
ulyth
had
learnt
how
to
tell
the
time
by
the
position
of
this
particular
constellation
she
made
a
rapid
calculation
now
reckoning
from
the
day
of
the
month
and
was
glad
to
find
it
came
out
correctly
cassiopeia
white
arms
were
hidden
by
the
mountains
but
the
milky
way
shimmered
in
the
east
and
overhead
arcturus
blazed
as
he
had
done
in
the
days
when
the
patriarch
job
recorded
his
brilliance
to
the
extreme
north
a
patch
of
light
lay
behind
penllwyd
where
the
sun
at
this
season
hardly
dipping
far
out
of
sight
worked
his
course
round
to
the
east
again
how
quiet
it
was
the
silence
was
almost
oppressive
the
gentle
lap
of
the
tiny
waves
on
the
lake
was
not
equal
to
the
rush
of
the
stream
at
the
woodlands
not
even
a
called
the
camp
was
absolutely
still
and
slumbering
ulyth
rose
and
paced
about
for
a
while
it
was
too
cold
to
sit
still
long
she
must
only
use
the
when
she
needed
a
rest
sentries
ought
to
be
allowed
chocolates
she
murmured
or
hot
peppermints
just
to
keep
up
their
spirits
ugh
how
weird
and
eerie
it
all
is
there
is
a
sound
anywhere
it
not
an
enlivening
performance
to
keep
watch
i
must
say
she
stopped
suddenly
on
the
alert
what
was
that
noise
in
the
darkness
to
her
left
she
distinctly
heard
a
rustle
among
the
and
thought
something
moved
in
the
deep
shadow
halt
who
goes
there
she
challenged
there
was
no
reply
but
the
rustle
sounded
again
this
time
nearer
to
the
camp
she
listened
with
every
sense
strained
to
the
uttermost
something
or
someone
was
slinking
in
from
the
field
and
creeping
cautiously
towards
the
tents
of
that
she
was
nearly
certain
wild
ideas
of
thieving
tramps
flooded
her
brain
a
louder
sound
confirmed
her
suspicions
she
could
hear
it
quite
distinctly
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
her
duty
was
plain
she
blew
her
whistle
promptly
it
was
answered
by
those
of
the
three
other
sentries
from
the
north
east
and
south
quarters
and
immediately
torches
began
to
flash
and
voices
to
ask
the
cause
of
alarm
the
guard
was
roused
and
began
an
instant
tour
of
inspection
something
crept
past
me
straight
towards
the
centre
of
the
camp
ulyth
reported
the
lights
flashed
away
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
the
girls
were
on
their
mettle
and
meant
business
whoever
the
intruder
was
he
should
be
run
to
earth
and
made
to
give
an
account
of
himself
they
felt
perfectly
capable
of
taking
him
prisoner
and
binding
his
hands
behind
him
with
a
rope
indeed
they
thought
they
should
hugely
enjoy
doing
so
particularly
if
he
turned
out
to
be
a
burglar
numbers
give
courage
and
a
very
martial
spirit
was
in
the
air
if
he
hiding
in
one
of
the
tents
we
drag
him
out
by
the
legs
proclaimed
marjorie
earnshaw
fiercely
everybody
was
sure
it
must
be
a
he
the
news
spread
through
the
camp
like
lightning
and
it
was
even
rumoured
that
he
wore
a
coat
and
miss
teddington
herself
had
emerged
and
was
waving
a
lantern
as
a
searchlight
this
way
blustered
marjorie
heading
for
the
kitchen

the
sneaking
cur
we
have
him
why

a
noise
there
something
there
really
urged
kathleen
simpson
with
a
most
unsoldierly
squeal
oh
i
say
here
he
comes
there
was
a
sudden
scratch
and
scramble
and
from
out
the
larder
rushed
a
dark
object
on
four
legs
with
a
white
something
in
its
mouth
helen
made
a
valiant
dash
at
it
but
it
dodged
her
and
flew
like
the
wind
away
between
the
tents
and
off
somewhere
over
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
the
guard
with
one
accord
burst
out
laughing
a
thieving

said
miss
teddington
we
must
take
steps
to
make
the
larder
safer

we
shall
be
troubled
again
we
place
a

over
it

catherine

under

after
the
scare
in
the
small
hours
everyone
settled
down
again
to
slumber
nevertheless
the
girls
woke
with
the
birds
many
of
them
had
registered
a
solemn
vow
the
night
before
that
they
would
watch
the
sun
rise
and
each
was
pledged
to
arouse
the
others
at
all
costs
so
at
the
first
hint
of
dawn
heads
began
to
pop
out
of
tents
and
the
camp
was
astir
addie
knighton
still
with
sleep
was
led
firmly
by
gertrude
oliver
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
forced
to
wash
her
face
you
thank
me
when
you
really
awake
purred

ignoring
her
victim
protests
it
only
what
i
promised

faithfully
last
night

told
me
to
duck

i
left

doing

going
round
the
tents
with
a
wet
sponge
look
is
that
worth
getting
up
to
see
the
grey
of
the
sky
had
flushed
into
carnation
pink
and
up
from
behind
the
wall
of
the
mountains
rose
the
great
ball
of
the
sun
red
at
first
through
a
veil
of
mist
but
shining
out
golden
as
he
cleared
the
everything
was
waking
up
a
peewit
called
by
the
edge
a
cock
crew
from
the
and
a
dog
barked
lustily
our
thief
of
the
night
complaining
of
an
attack
of
indigestion

consumed
three
rabbits
once
laughed

did
ask
it
how

felt
afterwards

got
a
good
thrashing
i
remember
we
keep
a
stick
handy
in
case
of
any
more
raids
who
on
breakfast
duty
i
getting
wildly
hungry
i
hope
the
bacon
disappeared
with
the
mutton
although
the
three
days
sojourn
under
canvas
was
in
a
sense
a
holiday
it
was
conducted
in
a
very
spirit
and
with
rigid
discipline
all
the
daily
duties
were
performed
zealously
by
bands
of
servers
who
polished
tins
peeled
potatoes
washed
plates
or
cleaned
shoes
as
the
case
might
be
the
league
was
putting
to
a
practical
proof
the
seven
rules
of
the
law
beauty
was
all
around
them
and
knowledge
to
be
had
for
the
asking
they
proved
themselves
trustworthy
by
their
service
and
glorified
work
in
the
doing
of
the
camp
tasks
health
was
drawn
with
every
breath
of
mountain
air
and
judging
from
their
faces
the
seventh
rule
be
happy
seemed
almost
superfluous
everyone
looked
radiant
even
mary
acton
who
was
a
champion
grumbler
and
generally
ready
to
complain
of
crumpled
after
breakfast
and
service
duty
came
drill
a
more
than
usually
formal
affair
for
arnold
himself
reviewed
them
he
had
great
experience
with
the
boy
scouts
so
the
girls
were
anxious
to
do
the
utmost
credit
to
their
beloved
guardian
of
the
fire
the
ambulance
corps
gave
a
demonstration
of
first
aid
another
detachment
took
down
and
a
tent
the
juniors
showed
their
abilities
in
and
the
seniors
in
signalling
their
inspector
declared
himself
perfectly
satisfied
and
commended
certain
members
for
special
proficiency
i
shall
tell
the
boys
battalions
how
well
you
can
do
he
declared
it
will
put
them
on
their
mettle
they
wo
want
to
be
beaten
by
a
ladies
school
when
the
display
was
over
all
dispersed
for
a
ramble
round
the
lake
while
the
dinner
stewed
only
the
cooks
on
duty
remained
carefully
watching
their
pots
ulyth
rona
lizzie
and
gertrude
wandered
past
the
farm
and
up
the
to
the
head
of
a
crag
whence
they
had
a
glorious
view
down
over
the
sheet
of
water
below
llyn
gwynedd
looks
so
cheerful
and
innocent
now
one
would
believe
it
could
ever
be
treacherous
and
do
dreadful
things
remarked
gertrude
what
things
asked
ulyth
why
i
believe
someone
was
drowned
just
down
there
a
great
many
years
ago
i
heard
catherine
saying
so
last
night
so
i
suppose
it
true
it
perfectly
true
and
i
can
tell
you
who
it
was
answered
lizzie
it
was
the
eldest
son
of
lord
glyncraig
he
was
fishing
here
and
the
boat
got
upset
it
was
the
most
dreadful
tragedy
he
was
such
a
fine
promising
young
fellow
and
had
only
been
married
quite
a
short
time
he
was
the
heir
too
which
made
it
worse
but
there
are
other
sons
are
there
asked
ulyth
yes
but
he
was
the
flower
of
the
family
the
rest
are
no
good
the
second
son
the
present
heir
is
a
helpless
invalid
the
third
is
in
a
sanatorium
for
consumption
and
the
fourth
was
the
proverbial
prodigal
and
disappeared
if
lord
glyncraig
knows
where
he
is
nobody
else
does
had
the
one
who
was
drowned
any
children
only
a
girl
the
second
and
third
are
married
then
will
the
estate
have
to
go
to
the
prodigal
in
the
end
i
suppose
so
if
he
alive
and
turns
up
to
claim
it
peers
have
their
troubles
as
much
as
commoners
commented
ulyth
never
heard
this
before
i
sorry
for
lord
glyncraig
plas
cafn
is
too
good
to
go
to
a
prodigal
yet
prodigals
sometimes
turn
out
better
than
elder
brothers
if
we
accept
the
parable
remarked
rona
throwing
stones
into
the
water
as
viciously
as
if
she
were
aiming
at
an
enemy
do
said
ulyth
you
disturb
the
trout
and
arnold
wants
to
fish
this
afternoon
rona
do
stop
let
go
down
to
the
edge
again
and
try
and
find
some
bog
bean
you
get
a
proficiency
badge
if
you
can
show
twenty
specimens
of
wild
flowers
and
name
them
yes
i
won
mine
last
year
and
so
did
lizzie
i
rather
win
a
proficiency
badge
for
shooting
grunted
rona
why
ca
teddie
let
us
get
up
a
ladies
rifle
corps
only
wish
she
would
just
it
would
be
prime
agreed
the
others
dinner
was
ready
by
twelve
not
at
all
too
early
for
a
company
that
had
breakfasted
at
seven
despite
the
purloining
of
the
leg
of
mutton
there
was
enough
to
go
round
and
everybody
decided
that
the
cooks
deserved
proficiency
badges
the
servers
also
did
their
work
promptly
and
removed
plates
and
dishes
with
the
maximum
of
speed
and
the
minimum
of
clatter
by
one
everything
was
washed
up
and
polished
and
the
kitchen
department
in
order
i
afraid
we
may
have
rain
said
miss
teddington
looking
anxiously
at
the
sky
which
was
now
completely
overcast
with
clouds
one
often
gets
a
shower
among
the
mountains
when
the
valley
escapes
commented
arnold
i
do
think
it
will
be
much
this
afternoon
if
there
rain
at
all
the
patrols
know
what
to
do
if
it
begins
this
grey
sky
will
be
good
for
fishing
arnold
was
an
enthusiastic
angler
and
had
brought
her
with
her
to
camp
she
intended
that
afternoon
to
hire
a
boat
from
the
farm
and
see
if
she
could
beguile
some
of
the
wily
trout
from
the
lake
i
take
four
girls
with
me
she
announced
two
to
row
one
to
steer
and
one
to
help
with
the
needless
to
say
she
could
have
had
dozens
of
volunteers
but
her
choice
fell
on
kathleen
simpson
ruth
white
gladys
broughton
and
evie
isherwood
who
highly
elated
went
off
to
unmoor
the
boat
then
ruth
and
kathleen
rowing
and
gladys
steering
they
made
gently
down
the
lake
towards
the
west
end
where
the
stream
flowed
out
pretty
arnold
looked
particularly
charming
in
a
with
a
little
blue
fisherman
cap
perched
on
her
fair
hair
it
was
the
fashion
for
the
girls
to
adore
her
and
she
certainly
had
four
admirers
with
her
that
afternoon
ready
to
be
at
her
beck
and
call
and
to
perform
any
service
she
wished
they
followed
her
instructions
to
the
letter
and
watched
her
line
and
reel
with
tense
eagerness
i
hope
we
may
catch
some
salmon
trout
said
arnold
they
much
more
delicate
than
the
ordinary
ones
if
we
luck
we
may
get
enough
at
any
rate
to
give
miss
bowes
and
miss
teddington
a
dish
for
supper
row
gently
along
there
i
saw
a
fish
jump
if
it
hungry
it
may
fancy
my
fly
good
biz
there
a
bite
i
have
to
play
him
gently
he
feels
a
strong
fellow
are
you
ready
evie
with
the
it
was
frightfully
exciting
as
arnold
wound
her
reel
and
the
prey
came
within
reach
was
he
really
hooked
or
would
he
break
away
at
the
last
moment
and
disappoint
them
we
got
him
we
got
him
quick
evie
oh
i
say
is
he
splendid
a
gleaming
glittering
object
was
leaping
in
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
oh
what
luck
yelled
evie
he
must
be
a
patriarch
cried
the
rowers
i
ca
see
him
oh
do
let
me
look
squealed
gladys
forgetting
everything
in
her
eagerness
ruth
you
in
the
way
i
must
look
and
up
she
sprang
trying
to
push
past
ruth
and
kathleen
sit
still
shouted
arnold
frantically
but
the
mischief
was
done
it
all
happened
in
two
seconds
no
one
quite
knew
how
though
ruth
declared
afterwards
that
in
trying
to
scramble
past
her
gladys
stepped
on
the
gunwale
over
toppled
the
boat
and
almost
before
its
occupants
knew
their
danger
they
were
struggling
in
the
water
the
girls
could
swim
a
little
a
very
little
kathleen
gasping
and
spluttering
struggled
valiantly
towards
the
bank
evie
with
a
certain
instinct
of
turned
on
her
back
and
managed
to
keep
herself
afloat
somehow
ruth
and
gladys
clutched
the
upturned
boat
and
clung
there
screaming
arnold
was
in
even
more
desperate
straits
she
could
not
swim
and
she
had
fallen
too
wide
of
the
boat
to
be
able
to
grasp
it
the
few
patrols
left
in
charge
of
the
camp
stood
for
a
moment
paralysed
then
tore
along
the
side
of
the
lake
towards
the
scene
of
the
accident
but
someone
else
was
quicker
rona
hunting
for
botany
specimens
had
been
watching
the
fishing
from
the
bank
close
by
there
was
a
rush
a
splash
a
swift
little
figure
wildly
ploughing
a
path
through
the
lake
beating
the
water
with
short
impatient
strokes
i
wo
clutch
you
cried
arnold
pluckily
keeping
her
presence
of
mind
i
believe
i
can
manage
to
float
she
lay
still
as
rona
put
a
hand
under
her
shoulder
and
towed
her
towards
the
shore
so
still
that
she
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
when
doris
and
catherine
who
had
reached
the
spot
helped
to
drag
her
from
the
water
oh
she
drowned
shrieked
doris
no
no
lay
her
down
flat
she
opening
her
eyes
marion
harper
and
madge
johnson
both
tolerable
swimmers
were
plunging
to
help
evie
kathleen
was
already
struggling
ashore
wait
till
we
can
come
for
you
shouted
rona
to
ruth
and
gladys
do
let
go
the
boat
evie
was
pulled
ashore
first
not
much
the
worse
rona
had
trouble
with
gladys
who
had
waxed
hysterical
but
with
marion
help
she
landed
her
safely
and
went
back
for
ruth
by
this
time
the
blown
lustily
from
several
league
whistles
brought
all
who
were
anywhere
within
reach
rushing
to
the
rendezvous
arnold
with
wet
golden
hair
clinging
round
her
white
face
leaned
against
catherine
shoulder
while
doris
rubbed
her
hands
i
glad
my
husband
gone
to
capel
garmon
please
let
me
tell
him
myself
were
her
first
words
it
was
good
little
rona
who
saved
me
she
added
smiling
faintly
at
miss
bowes
who
was
down
on
her
knees
beside
her
on
the
grass
i
wish
i
done
it
i
wish
i
done
it
oh
how
i
envy
you
rona
cried
ulyth
regarding
her
friend
with
wide
shining
eyes
of
admiration
miss
teddington
pale
but
very
had
taken
command
of
the
situation
eight
people
were
thoroughly
wet
through
and
bedraggled
and
must
be
hurried
to
camp
and
dried
and
given
hot
drinks
as
speedily
as
possible
the
rescuers
needed
cosseting
as
much
as
the
rescued
madge
and
marion
were
shivering
and
trembling
and
rona
now
the
excitement
of
her
sudden
dash
was
over
looked
more
shaky
than
she
would
allow
we
must
tuck
them
up
in
blankets
said
miss
teddington
first
aid
corps
on
duty
please
the
difficulty
is
going
to
be
how
to
get
their
clothes
properly
dried
in
a
place
like
this
arnold
with
miss
bowes
to
look
after
her
went
to
the
farm
to
seek
fresh
garments
as
for
the
girls
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
to
bed
for
an
hour
or
two
while
a
band
of
servers
lighted
a
good
fire
wrung
the
water
from
the
drenched
articles
of
clothing
and
held
them
to
the
blaze
blankets
were
commandeered
freely
from
other
beds
and
piled
round
the
seven
heroines
who
propped
up
with
pillows
each
had
a
kind
of
reception
as
she
sipped
her
hot
cocoa
we
all
of
us
forgot
about
the
boat
said
rona
suddenly
it
drifting
upside
down
and
the
oars
are
anywhere
never
mind
david
lewis
will
get
it
somehow
i
suppose
it
will
drift
towards
the
bank
and
he
wade
for
it
where
did
you
learn
to
swim
like
that
rona
in
the
lake
at
home
we
had
one
nearly
as
big
as
this
close
to
our
farm
the
cuckoo
turned
up
trumps
murmured
alice
denham
i
did
know
she
was
capable
of
it
then
it
only
shows
how
extremely
stupid
and
unobservant
you
are
snapped
ulyth
the
servers
declared
afterwards
that
drying
clothes
round
a
bonfire
was
the
most
exciting
duty
they
had
ever
performed
gusts
of
wind
blew
the
flames
in
sudden
puffs
necessitating
quick
snatching
away
of
garments
in
the
danger
zone
shoes
were
the
most
difficult
of
all
and
needed
copious
greasing
to
prevent
their
growing
stiff
i
wonder
if
the
ancient
britons
went
through
this
performance
said
winnie
fowler
did
they
have
to
hold
their
skin
garments
round
thank
goodness
we
got
these
things
dry
at
last
only
in
the
nick
of
time
here
comes
the
rain
it
was
a
melancholy
truth
the
welsh
mountains
have
a
perverse
habit
of
attracting
clouds
even
in
june
the
sky
which
had
been
overcast
since
midday
was
now
inky
dark
and
great
drops
began
to
fall
it
was
a
calamity
but
one
for
which
everybody
was
fully
prepared
the
patrols
rushed
round
the
camp
loosening
ropes
lest
the
swelling
hemp
should
draw
the
pegs
from
the
ground
and
took
a
last
tour
of
inspection
to
see
that
no
bed
was
in
contact
with
the
canvas
if
you
even
touch
the
inside
of
the
tent
with
your
hand
you
bring
the
water
through
urged
catherine
in
solemn
warning
so
for
your
own
sakes
you
best
be
careful
you
do
want
to
spend
the
night
in
a
puddle
it
was
a
new
experience
to
sit
inside
tents
while
the
storm
howled
outside
rain
up
at
llyn
gwynedd
was
no
mere
summer
shower
but
a
driving
deluge
servers
in
waterproofs
scuttled
round
with
cans
of
hot
tea
and
baskets
of
bread
and
butter
and
the
girls
had
a
picnic
meal
sitting
on
their
beds
one
tent
blew
over
altogether
and
its
distressed
occupants
crawling
from
under
the
flapping
ruin
were
received
as
refugees
by
their
immediate
neighbours
fortunately
the
storm
though
severe
was
short
by
seven
it
had
expended
its
fury
and
passed
away
down
the
valley
towards
craigwen
leaving
blue
sky
and
the
promise
of
a
sunset
behind
glad
to
emerge
from
their
cramped
quarters
the
girls
came
out
and
compared
experiences
there
was
plenty
to
be
done
the
fallen
tent
had
to
be
erected
and
various
cans
and
utensils
which
had
been
left
outside
must
be
collected
and
wiped
before
they
had
time
to
rust
this
is
the
prose
of
said
catherine
picking
the
out
of
a
puddle
and
rinsing
it
in
the
lake
i
hope
we
shall
get
the
poetry
again
oh
it
lovely
fun
when
it
rains
twittered
some
of
the
younger
ones
arnold
came
down
from
the
farm
to
inquire
rather
anxiously
how
the
camp
was
faring
after
the
storm
and
particularly
to
have
news
of
the
girls
who
had
been
in
the
lake
he
had
left
arnold
in
bed
still
rather
upset
with
the
shock
of
the
accident
i
feel
responsible
for
bringing
you
all
here
he
said
to
miss
teddington
i
sha
be
easy
in
my
mind
now
till
the
whole
crew
safe
back
at
the
woodlands
we
taken
no
harm
miss
teddington
assured
him
the
girls
kept
dry
and
they
as
jolly
as
possible
indeed
i
think
most
of
them
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
rain
llyn
gwynedd
after
showing
what
it
could
do
in
the
way
of
storms
provided
fine
weather
for
the
next
day
the
ground
soon
dried
and
continued
in
full
swing
arnold
herself
again
after
a
night
rest
took
the
morning
drill
and
led
a
ramble
up
the
slope
of
glyder
garmon
in
the
afternoon
she
was
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
stunt
that
evening
the
girls
at
any
rate
were
sorry
to
say
to
the
lake
on
friday
morning
whatever
their
elders
might
feel
on
the
subject
i
hope
the
boy
scouts
will
have
as
ripping
a
time
as
we
had
was
the
general
verdict
when
having
left
the
camp
in
perfect
order
the
procession
set
out
to
tramp
down
to
aberglyn
barring
total
immersions
in
the
lake
please
said
arnold
as
he
returned
the
parting
salute
but
that
was
an
opportunity
urged
ulyth
i
wish
it
had
come
my
way
rona
madge
and
marion
will
all
get
special
bravery
medals
at
next
quarterly
meeting

susannah
maude
the
girls
at
the
woodlands
while
they
contributed
to
various
charities
had
one
special
and
particular
object
of
interest
for
several
years
they
had
supported
a
little
girl
at
an
orphanage
she
was
called
their
orphan
and
twice
a
year
they
received
accounts
of
her
progress
they
sent
her
a
christmas
present
annually
and
her
neat
little
letter
of
thanks
was
handed
round
for
everybody
to
read
poor
susannah
maude
was
the
daughter
of
very
disreputable
parents
she
had
been
rescued
from
a
travelling
caravan
at
the
age
of
ten
and
the
authorities
at
the
alexandra
home
had
done
their
best
to
obliterate
her
past
life
from
her
memory
when
she
reached
age
the
question
of
her
future
career
loomed
on
the
horizon
after
considerable
correspondence
with
the
matron
miss
bowes
had
at
length
decided
to
have
the
girl
at
the
woodlands
and
try
the
experiment
of
training
her
as
a
so
in
february
susannah
maude
had
arrived
small
and
undersized
with
a
sharp
little
face
and
beady
black
eyes
and
a
habit
of
sniffing
as
if
she
had
a
perpetual
cold
not
a
bit
like
the
orphan
of
fiction
decided
the
girls
rather
disappointed
at
the
sight
of
their
protégée
perhaps
the
cook
was
disappointed
too
at
any
rate
many
complaints
of
smashed
dishes
imperfect
wiping
and
inadequate
sweeping
of
corners
reached
miss
bowes
who
urged
patience
harangued
the
culprit
and
shook
her
head
half
laughing
and
half
sighing
over
the
domestic
catastrophes
though
strictly
confined
to
the
kitchen
regions
the
orphan
took
the
deepest
interest
in
the
young
ladies
of
the
school
her
keen
eyes
would
peer
out
of
windows
and
her
head
bob
round
doors
in
continual
efforts
to
gain
some
idea
of
their
mode
of
life
a
chance
word
from
one
of
them
wreathed
her
in
smiles
she
was
a
funny
odd
little
object
with
her
short
squat
figure
and
round
bullet
head
and
thin
little
legs
appearing
underneath
her
official
white
apron
her
official
name
was
susan
but
every
girl
in
the
school
called
her
susannah
maude
at
the
instigation
of
miss
bowes
her
patrons
took
the
furthering
of
her
education
in
hand
and
each
in
turn
bestowed
half
an
hour
a
day
in
hearing
her
read
history
geography
or
some
other
suitable
subject
a
little
bewildered
among
so
many
fresh
teachers
the
small
maid
nevertheless
made
what
efforts
she
could
and
read
loud
and
lustily
even
if
she
did
not
altogether
digest
the
matter
she
was
supposed
to
be
studying
i
believe
she
reads
the
words
without
taking
in
a
scrap
of
the
sense
laughed
ulyth
when
her
turn
as
instructress
was
over
she
was
gazing
at
my
dress
or
my
watch
or
my
handkerchief
whenever
she
could
spare
an
eye
from
her
book
she
thinks
them
of
far
more
importance
than
henry
viii
so
she
does
agreed
lizzie
i
tried
to
get
her
interested
yesterday
in
the
number
of
his
wives
i
thought
the
bluebeard
aspect
of
it
might
move
her
but
she
only
said
does
it
matter
when
they
all
dead
i
felt
so
blank
that
i
could
say
any
more
nobody
quite
remembered
whose
idea
it
was
that
their
orphan
should
be
invited
to
the
meetings
somebody
in
a
moment
suggested
it
and
arnold
replied
oh
yes
poor
little
soul
bring
her
by
all
means
so
susannah
maude
had
come
and
once
there
she
apparently
regarded
herself
as
a
member
of
the
league
and
turned
up
on
every
available
occasion
how
much
she
understood
of
the
proceedings
or
of
the
scope
of
the
society
nobody
could
fathom
she
sat
during
the
meetings
bolt
upright
with
folded
arms
as
if
she
were
in
school
her
bright
beady
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
upon
arnold
whom
she
seemed
to
regard
as
a
species
of
priestess
in
charge
of
occult
mysteries
would
i
be
struck
dumb
if
i
told
what
goes
on
here
she
asked
ulyth
one
day
and
although
she
was
assured
that
no
such
act
of
vengeance
on
the
part
of
providence
would
overtake
her
she
nevertheless
preserved
a
secrecy
worthy
of
a
freemason
and
would
drop
no
hint
in
the
kitchen
as
to
the
nature
of
the
ceremonies
she
witnessed
one
or
two
points
evidently
made
a
great
impression
upon
her
during
the
spring
months
nature
lore
was
very
much
to
the
fore
and
the
members
qualified
for
candidateship
to
the
various
grades
by
exhibiting
their
knowledge
of
the
ways
and
habits
of
birds
notes
of
observations
were
read
aloud
at
the
meetings
particulars
recorded
of
nests
that
had
been
built
in
the
school
grounds
with
data
as
to
the
number
of
days
in
which
eggs
were
hatched
and
the
young
ones
fledged
it
was
an
unwritten
law
at
the
woodlands
never
to
disturb
the
birds
the
girls
were
not
allowed
to
take
any
eggs
from
the
nests
and
were
taught
not
to
frighten
a
sitting
bird
or
to
interfere
with
the
after
several
years
of
such
consideration
the
woodlands
had
become
a
kind
of
bird
sanctuary
where
the
little
songsters
appeared
to
know
they
were
free
from
molestation
that
the
fruit
in
the
garden
suffered
rather
a
heavy
toll
was
true
but
as
miss
bowes
remarked
one
ca
have
everything
we
must
remember
how
many
insects
they
clear
away
and
not
grudge
them
a
few
currants
and
gooseberries
they
pay
us
by
their
lovely
songs
in
the
spring
ulyth
was
a
great
devotee
of
nature
study
and
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
being
the
first
to
discover
that
a
pair
of
tits
were
building
in
a
down
the
paddock
she
was
immensely
excited
for
they
were
rather
rare
birds
in
that
district
and
generally
nested
much
higher
up
on
the
hills
this
was
indeed
the
only
instance
on
record
of
their
having
selected
the
woodlands
for
their
domestic
operations
as
she
had
made
the
discovery
it
was
her
particular
privilege
to
take
the
observations
and
every
day
she
would
go
very
quietly
and
cautiously
and
seat
herself
near
the
spot
to
note
the
doings
of
the
shy
little
architects
it
was
a
subject
of
intense
interest
to
watch
the
globular
nest
grow
and
then
to
ascertain
when
the
parents
were
out
of
the
way
that
eggs
had
actually
been
laid
in
it
ulyth
was
so
afraid
of
disturbing
the
tits
that
she
conducted
her
daily
observations
alone
fearing
lest
even
lizzie
presence
might
frighten
them
when
there
are
two
of
us
we
ca
help
talking
and
an
unusual
sound
scares
them
worse
than
anything
she
decided
one
morning
she
started
for
her
daily
expedition
to
the
paddock
the
little
hen
had
been
sitting
long
enough
to
make
ulyth
think
the
eggs
must
surely
be
hatched
and
that
probably
the
parents
were
both
already
busy
catering
for
their
progeny
she
crept
noiselessly
round
the
corner
to
the
hollow
where
the
bushes
were
situated
then
she
gave
a
gasp
and
a
cry
of
horror
on
the
ground
quite
close
to
the
nest
knelt
susannah
maude
busily
occupied
in
smearing
some
sticky
white
substance
over
the
lower
boughs
and
shoots
of
the
she
looked
round
with
a
beaming
face
as
ulyth
approached
her
beady
eyes
twinkled
with
susannah
what
are
you
doing
you
young
imp
of
mischief
exclaimed
ulyth
in
an
agony
catching
your
birds
for
you
miss
responded
the
orphan
a
thrill
of
pride
in
her
voice
it
this
is
and
it
soon
stick
you
see
i
knows
all
about
it
for
my
father
was
a
and
i
often
went
with
him
when
i
was
a
kid
i
a
job
to
get
the
lime
i
can
tell
you
but
bobby
jones
brought
me
some
from
llangarmon
she
looked
at
ulyth
with
a
smile
as
if
waiting
for
the
praise
that
she
deemed
due
to
her
efforts
utterly
aghast
ulyth
stammered
but
susannah
maude
we
we
do
want
the
birds
caught
the
orphan
appeared
puzzled
a
shade
crossed
her
sharp
little
face
not
want
to
catch
what
the
use
of
then
dad
caught
and
sold
ulyth
had
to
keep
a
strong
curb
over
her
temper
after
all
how
could
this
ignorant
child
know
what
she
had
never
been
taught
miss
bowes
might
well
preach
patience
and
forbearance
it
very
cruel
to
snare
the
birds
with
lime
at
any
time
especially
now
when
they
have
young
ones
who
would
starve
without
them
she
explained
with
what
calm
she
could
muster
promise
me
that
you
will
never
try
to
do
such
a
thing
again
and
never
interfere
with
any
of
the
nests
arnold
will
be
most
grieved
to
hear
of
this
the
orphan
black
eyes
filled
with
tears
will
she
mind
i
thought
she
like
to
keep
in
a
cage
as
pets
do
anything
in
the
world
to
please
her
then
leave
the
birds
alone
if
you
want
to
please
her
run
now
to
the
house
and
fetch
me
a
basin
full
of
hot
water
and
a
cloth
i
must
wipe
all
this
horrible
stuff
off
the
bushes
bring
a
knife
too
for
i
shall
have
to
cut
away
some
of
the
branches
and
burn
them
i
hope
the
tits
wo
desert
ulyth
was
late
for
school
that
morning
but
the
offence
was
condoned
by
miss
teddington
when
she
heard
the
reason
i
hope
you
washed
every
scrap
of
the
lime
off
she
asked
anxiously
i
did
leave
it
while
there
was
enough
to
catch
even
a
the
birds
are
back
they
came
directly
i
gone
a
dozen
yards
away
that
shows
the
young
ones
are
hatched
i
hope
susan
wo
direct
her
energies
into
any
other
experiments
we
shall
be
sorry
we
brought
her
to
the
if
she
does
she
means
well
but
the
worst
of
her
is
that
you
never
can
calculate
in
the
least
what
she
may
do
next
she
a
problem
during
the
summer
term
the
guild
had
many
informal
meetings
by
the
stream
the
girls
were
often
allowed
to
take
tea
there
a
permission
which
they
highly
appreciated
arnold
had
lent
them
a
small
in
which
they
could
bake
cakes
and
many
culinary
efforts
resulted
from
the
acquisition
on
saturday
afternoon
gertrude
oliver
and
addie
knighton
were
on
the
as
special
scouts
and
having
mixed
some
placed
them
carefully
in
the
oven
they
were
in
charge
of
the
and
responsible
for
the
preparation
of
the
tea
to
which
that
day
all
the
mistresses
were
to
be
specially
invited
the
rest
of
the
school
were
in
the
practising
under
the
joint
superintendence
of
arnold
and
miss
teddington
it
a
nuisance
we
ca
leave
the
cakes
sighed
addie
i
did
so
want
to
see
them
send
that
message
about
the
aeroplane
they
baking
all
right
said
gertrude
we
ca
make
them
any
quicker
by
looking
at
them
could
we
just
run
to
the
top
of
the
and
watch
for
a
few
minutes
there
susannah
maude
keep
an
eye
on
them
hello
susan
the
orphan
in
virtue
of
being
a
of
the
was
wandering
about
by
the
stream
in
the
wake
of
the
proceedings
she
came
running
up
eagerly
at
gertrude
call
i
mind
for
you
miss
i
watched
cook
dozens
of
times
look
after
the
kettle
too
you
leave
it
to
me
i
hope
it
wo
be
a
case
of
king
alfred
and
the
cakes
susan
grinned
comprehension
standard
v
historical
reader
not
me
she
chuckled
i
always
thought
the
woman
was
a
silly
to
trust
a
man
to
turn
the
cakes
well
mind
you
show
up
better
you
might
as
well
put
the
in
the
stream
to
keep
cool
we
do
want
it
curdled
and
i
certain
there
thunder
about
addie
and
gertie
were
sure
they
were
not
absent
long
they
just
stood
and
watched
a
few
messages
being
sent
then
ran
back
promptly
to
their
duties
susannah
maude
was
in
the
very
act
of
trying
to
lift
the
big
from
its
trivet
hold
hard
there
screamed
addie
running
to
the
rescue
you
move
that
alone
susan
stop
it
was
too
late
however
the
small
busybody
had
managed
to
stir
the
kettle
but
her
youthful
arms
being
quite
unequal
to
sustaining
its
weight
she
let
it
drop
retreating
with
a
wild
indian
yell
of
alarm
the
stream
of
boiling
water
fortunately
escaped
her
but
nearly
put
out
the
fire
when
the
steam
and
dust
had
subsided
the
rueful
scouts
picked
up
the
empty
kettle
gingerly
as
it
was
hot
we
shall
have
to
build
up
the
fire
again
lamented
gertrude
oh
addie
the
cakes
she
might
well
exclaim
in
a
row
among
the
ashes
were
the
soaked
remains
of
the
precious
i
took
out
of
the
oven
because
they
were
done
explained
susan
hastily
justifying
herself
i
thought
you
should
blame
me
for
letting
burn
anyhow
and
i
put
down
there
on
some
to
keep
hot
i
could
tell
the
kettle
would
fall
on
they
done
for
sighed
addie
there
is
one
fit
to
eat
help
us
to
fill
the
kettle
again
as
soon
as
you
can
and
fetch
some
more
sticks
and
gorse
you
susan
where
the
asked
gertrude
uneasily
i
put
it
in
the
stream
as
you
told
me
replied
the
orphan
rather
sulkily
indicating
with
a
nod
the
location
decidedly
anxious
as
to
its
safety
the
girls
ran
to
the
they
always
put
the
can
in
a
particular
little
sheltered
corner
fenced
in
by
a
few
stones
susannah
had
helped
them
to
place
it
there
many
times
and
had
even
named
the
spot
the
dairy
they
looked
in
vain
the
milk
was
certainly
not
there
now
what
in
the
name
of
thunder
have
you
done
with
the
can
you
wretched
imp
shouted
addie
thoroughly
angry
you
said
it
ought
to
keep
very
cool
so
i
threw
it
into
the
deep
pool
my
fault
retorted
susannah
who
had
a
temper
as
well
as
her
benefactresses
i
half
a
mind
to
throw
you
after
it
raged
gertie
her
fingers
twitching
to
shake
the
luckless
orphan
perhaps
susannah
experienced
eye
gauged
the
extent
of
her
wrath
and
decided
that
for
once
she
had
gone
too
far
she
did
not
wait
to
proffer
any
more
explanations
but
turned
and
fled
back
towards
the
house
resuming
her
neglected
in
the
scullery
with
a
zeal
that
astonished
the
cook
addie
and
gertie
replenished
the
and
refilled
the
kettle
but
the
cakes
were
hopeless
and
the
milk
was
beyond
recall
doris
deane
the
champion
swimmer
of
the
school
dived
for
the
can
next
morning
and
brought
it
up
empty
the
lid
was
never
recovered
probably
having
been
washed
into
a
hole
the
guild
sat
down
that
afternoon
rather
disconsolately
to
milkless
tea
addie
had
begged
a
small
jugful
from
the
kitchen
enough
for
their
guests
the
mistresses
but
it
was
impossible
to
replace
the
big
can
at
a
moment
notice
i
begin
to
wish
the
school
had
never
supported
an
orphan
at
the
home
for
destitute
children
sighed
gertie
eating
plain
bread
and
butter
and
thinking
regretfully
of
her
spoilt
cakes
i
vote
next
term
we
ask
to
give
up
collecting
for
it
and
keep
a
monkey
at
the
zoo
instead
we
could
send
it
nuts
and
biscuits
at
christmas
and
giggled
beth
broadway
you
are
about
the
most
unfeeling
wretch
i
ever
came
across
snapped
gertrude
chapter
xv
a
point
of
honour
lizzie
announced
ulyth
sitting
down
on
a
stump
in
the
glade
and
speaking
slowly
and
emphatically
the
woodlands
is
what
it
used
to
be
so
stephanie
was
saying
the
other
day
agreed
lizzie
taking
a
seat
on
the
stump
by
the
side
of
her
friend
she
thinks
it
a
different
place
altogether
it
is
though
not
exactly
from
stephie
point
of
view
i
do
care
the
least
scrap
that
there
are
no
vernons
or
courtenays
or
derringtons
here
now
stephie
can
lament
them
if
she
likes
i
never
knew
them
so
i
ca
regret
them
there
one
thing
i
ca
help
noticing
though
the
tone
has
been
going
down
do
you
think
it
has
replied
lizzie
thoughtfully
merle
and
alice
and
mary
are
rather
silly
certainly
but
there
not
much
harm
in
them
i
do
mean
our
form
it
the
juniors
i
noticed
it
continually
lately
now
you
come
to
speak
of
it
so
have
i
do
quite
know
what
it
is
but
there
a
something
there
a
very
decided
something
it
come
on
quite
lately
but
there
they
not
behaving
nicely
at
all
they
slacked
all
round
and
do
nothing
but
snigger
among
themselves
over
jokes
they
wo
tell
they
welcome
to
their
own
jokes
as
far
as
i
concerned
the
young
idiots
yes
if
it
only
just
fun
but
i
afraid
it
something
more
than
that
something
they
ashamed
of
and
really
want
to
hide
i
seen
such
shuffling
and
queer
business
going
on
when
any
of
the
monitresses
came
in
sight
have
you
said
anything
to
catherine
or
helen
no
and
i
do
want
to
it
very
unfortunate
but
they
really
got
no
tact
catherine
so
and
helen
nearly
as
bad
they
snap
the
girls
up
for
the
least
trifle
the
result
is
the
juniors
have
got
it
into
their
tiresome
young
heads
that
monitresses
are
a
species
of
teacher
they
were
intended
to
be
that
at
all
a
monitress
is
just
one
of
ourselves
only
with
authority
that
we
all
allow
she
ought
to
be
jolly
with
everybody
um
you
can
hardly
call
catherine
jolly
with
the
kids
that
just
it
they
resent
it
they
gone
their
own
way
lately
and
it
been
decidedly
downhill
i
persuaded
they
playing
some
deep
and
surreptitious
game
at
present
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
ca
rona
tell
you
i
would
pump
rona
for
the
world
it
most
frightfully
difficult
for
her
a
junior
to
be
with
a
senior
her
form
always
suspect
her
of
giving
them
away
to
the
upper
school
rona
had
a
hard
enough
struggle
to
get
any
footing
at
all
at
the
woodlands
and
i
do
want
to
make
it
any
harder
for
her
if
she
once
gets
the
reputation
of
she
done
for
since
stephanie
made
that
fuss
about
juniors
coming
into
senior
rooms
i
may
ask
her
into
v
b
so
if
ostracized
by
her
own
form
too
she
be
neither
fish
flesh
fowl
nor
good
red
herring
no
however
i
find
out
it
must
be
through
rona
yes
i
quite
see
your
point
now
you
speak
of
it
i
believe
those
juniors
are
up
to
something
there
a
prodigious
amount
of
whispering
and
sniggering
among
them
the
joke
i
said
to
tootie
phillips
yesterday
and
she
flared
out
in
the
most
truculent
manner
our
own
business
thank
you
tootie
has
been
making
herself
most
objectionable
lately
she
wants
sitting
upon
catherine
will
do
that
never
fear
no
doubt
but
it
does
bring
us
any
nearer
finding
out
what
those
juniors
are
after
they
vanish
mysteriously
after
tea
sometimes
i
vote
we
watch
them
and
next
time
it
happens
we
stalk
them
but
not
a
word
to
anybody
else
or
it
might
get
about
and
put
them
on
their
guard
trust
me
i
would
even
flicker
an
eyelid
now
that
ulyth
and
lizzie
had
compared
notes
on
the
subject
of
the
juniors
they
became
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
fact
that
something
surreptitious
was
going
on
nods
hints
words
which
apparently
bore
a
hidden
meaning
nudges
and
signs
were
the
order
of
the
day
all
friendly
advances
on
the
part
of
seniors
were
repelled
the
younger
girls
keeping
strictly
to
themselves
this
was
the
more
marked
as
there
had
never
been
any
very
great
division
at
the
woodlands
between
upper
and
lower
school
the
whole
of
the
little
community
sharing
in
most
of
the
general
interests
after
tea
there
was
a
short
interval
before
evening
preparation
began
and
during
the
summer
term
this
was
spent
if
possible
by
everybody
one
afternoon
only
a
few
days
after
the
conversation
just
recorded
the
girls
had
filed
as
usual
from
the
and
were
racing
off
for
tennis
or
a
run
by
the
stream
as
ulyth
down
on
her
knees
in
the
darkest
part
of
the
hall
cupboard
groped
for
her
mislaid
two
members
of
iv
b
came
in
for
a
moment
to
fetch
balls
they
were
in
a
hurry
and
they
evidently
did
not
perceive
her
presence
did
you
get
the
tip
irene
scott
asked
ethel
jephson
under
her
breath
by
the
lower
pool
immediately
all
serene
tootie
told
me
herself
pass
it
on
then
though
i
think
most
know
as
they
ran
down
the
passage
ulyth
relinquishing
her
hunt
for
the
missing
shoes
rose
to
her
feet
there
one
here
who
did
know
she
chuckled
this
is
a
most
important
piece
of
information
immediately
by
the
lower
pool
is
it
well
i
must
go
and
find
lizzie
what
are
those
precious
juniors
up
to
i
wonder
lizzie
was
taking
her
racket
for
a
game
of
tennis
but
she
readily
gave
up
her
place
to
merle
denham
at
a
hint
from
ulyth
i
told
you
they
vanished
after
tea
she
said
as
the
two
girls
sauntered
into
the
glen
we
track
them
this
time
do
on
any
account
look
as
if
you
were
going
anywhere
sit
down
here
and
give
them
a
few
minutes
grace
in
case
stragglers
come
up
they
probably
begin
punctually
i
time
it
by
my
watch
when
five
minutes
had
elapsed
there
was
not
a
solitary
junior
to
be
seen
in
the
glade
and
ulyth
and
lizzie
deeming
themselves
safe
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
lower
pool
this
was
a
part
of
the
stream
at
the
very
verge
of
the
grounds
belonging
to
the
woodlands
indeed
the
greater
portion
of
it
lay
in
the
land
of
a
neighbouring
farmer
and
to
reach
its
pebbly
bank
meant
a
scramble
round
some
palings
and
under
a
projecting
piece
of
rock
ulyth
and
lizzie
were
too
wary
to
follow
the
juniors
by
this
path
but
scaled
the
palings
at
another
point
and
under
cover
of
a
thick
copse
of
approached
the
pool
from
the
side
that
lay
in
the
field
by
most
careful
scouting
they
found
a
spot
on
the
bank
where
they
could
see
and
hear
without
being
seen
below
them
seated
on
the
rocks
by
the
edge
of
the
water
were
practically
almost
the
whole
of
the
lower
school
they
cuddled
close
with
their
arms
round
each
other
and
to
judge
from
their
repressed
giggles
they
appeared
to
be
enjoying
themselves
tootie
phillips
a
excitable
girl
of
thirteen
mounted
upon
a
boulder
was
addressing
them
with
much
fervour
ulyth
and
lizzie
missed
the
beginning
of
her
remarks
but
when
they
came
within
earshot
they
realized
that
she
was
in
the
midst
of
a
vigorous
harangue
against
the
seniors
are
we
to
be
trodden
down
just
because
we
a
little
younger
than
they
are
urged
tootie
why
should
they
lord
it
over
us
i
should
like
to
know
they
were
juniors
themselves
only
a
year
or
two
ago
i
tell
you
the
worm
will
turn
it
turned
pretty
considerably
guffawed
cissie
newall
it
knows
which
side
its
bread
buttered
cackled
irene
scott
buttered
you
mean
sugared
do
you
at
this
sally
the
whole
party
broke
into
a
shout
of
laughter
good
for
you
ciss
sugared
ra
ther
shut
up
you
sillies
someone
will
hear
us
commanded
tootie
i
was
saying
before
we
not
going
to
be
sat
upon
either
by
teachers
or
monitresses
or
seniors
we
take
our
own
way
a
sugary
way
chirped
ethel
jephson
the
girls
hinnied
again
there
was
evidently
something
underlying
the
joke
when
perfectly
ridiculous
rules
are
made
that
never
ought
to
have
been
made
continued
tootie
then
we
a
right
to
take
the
law
into
our
own
hands
and
do
as
we
please
our
pocket
money
our
own
grumbled
a
discontented
spirit
from
the
back
of
course
it
is
and
we
ought
to
be
able
to
do
what
we
like
with
it
and
so
are
our
brooches
if
we
want
to
sh
sh
shut
up
stupid
well
we
all
know
no
need
to
blare
it
out
if
we
do
i
was
blaring
violet
robertson
remember
your
oath
commanded
tootie
if
you
let
a
word
of
we
know
what
leak
out
you
sent
to
coventry
for
the
rest
of
the
term
yes
not
a
single
one
of
us
will
speak
one
single
word
to
you
not
even
your
own
so
there
well
you
need
make
such
a
precious
fuss
i
sure
i
was
letting
out
secrets
retorted
violet
sulkily
but
i
think
there
ought
to
be
some
rate
of
value
my
brooch
was
a
far
better
one
than
mollie
right
you
are
my
hearty
and
i
going
to
speak
about
it
we
let
ourselves
be
done
even
by
you
know
who
and
she
sharp
she
getting
too
sharp
we
must
stop
it
even
if
we
have
to
break
off
for
a
whole
week
no
no
oh
not
that
anyhow
well
look
here
if
you
such
sillies
you
deserve
but
at
this
most
interesting
point
the
loud
clanging
of
the
put
a
stop
to
any
further
argument
with
one
accord
the
girls
jumped
up
and
fled
back
as
fast
as
they
could
run
in
the
direction
of
the
school
ulyth
and
lizzie
at
the
risk
of
being
late
for
evening
gave
the
conspirators
time
to
get
well
away
before
they
ventured
to
follow
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
queried
lizzie
as
they
scouted
cautiously
through
the
glade
i
ca
imagine
they
evidently
doing
something
they
ought
to
the
young
wretches
but
they
keeping
it
very
dark
we
shall
have
to
watch
them
we
must
indeed
sighed
ulyth
lizzie
i
loathe
eavesdropping
and
anything
that
savours
of
underhand
work
but
what
are
we
to
do
something
is
going
wrong
among
the
juniors
and
for
the
sake
of
the
school
we
got
to
put
it
right
if
we
possibly
can
it
no
use
asking
them
their
sweet
secret
for
they
would
tell
us
and
i
afraid
setting
the
monitresses
on
the
track
would
only
make
things
worse
if
we
can
find
out
what
they
doing
then
we
shall
know
our
ground
i
a
and
you
a
and
we
must
appeal
to
them
to
keep
their
vows
but
we
ca
do
that
till
we
some
idea
of
which
rule
they
breaking
how
can
we
say
to
them
strongly
suspect
you
not
being
trustworthy
we
got
to
prove
our
words
prove
them
we
will
we
dodge
about
till
we
catch
them
in
the
act
agreed
lizzie
to
both
the
girls
it
was
uncongenial
though
necessary
work
as
seniors
and
league
officers
they
felt
they
owed
a
duty
to
the
school
but
that
it
would
be
far
wiser
to
appeal
privately
to
the
juniors
sense
of
honour
and
win
them
back
to
straight
paths
of
their
own
free
will
than
to
carry
the
matter
to
for
the
present
patience
and
tact
must
be
their
watchwords
several
days
went
by
and
nothing
particular
occurred
either
the
younger
girls
were
on
their
guard
or
they
had
suspended
their
activities
on
friday
evening
however
as
ulyth
was
coming
along
the
passage
from
practising
she
accidentally
cannonaded
into
half
a
dozen
members
of
iv
b
who
were
standing
near
the
boot
cupboard
she
evidently
surprised
them
for
one
and
all
they
hastily
popped
their
hands
into
their
pockets
it
was
promptly
done
but
not
so
quickly
as
to
prevent
ulyth
from
seeing
that
they
were
eating
something
it
all
right
gasped
bertha
halliwell
with
apparent
unconcern
in
reply
to
ulyth
apologies
you
nearly
upset
me
but
i
not
fractured
i
wish
you
take
care
though
grumbled
etta
jessop
surreptitiously
wiping
a
decidedly
sticky
mouth
no
one
likes
being
tumbled
over
ulyth
passed
on
thoughtfully
what
had
they
all
been
munching
and
where
did
they
get
it
from
private
supplies
of
cakes
and
sweets
were
utterly
forbidden
at
the
woodlands
their
prohibition
was
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
school
to
break
which
would
be
to
incur
a
very
severe
penalty
from
miss
teddington
was
this
the
explanation
of
rather
enigmatical
remarks
down
by
the
stream
if
that
their
precious
secret
and
they
just
being
greedy
i
too
disgusted
with
them
for
words
commented
lizzie
when
informed
of
the
discovery
saturday
and
monday
passed
with
quite
exemplary
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
juniors
the
keenest
vigilance
could
discover
nothing
but
on
tuesday
lizzie
came
across
another
clue
she
had
been
monitress
for
the
afternoon
in
the
and
after
the
girls
had
left
she
stayed
behind
to
put
away
various
articles
that
had
been
used
and
to
tidy
the
room
as
she
worked
along
the
desks
where
iv
b
had
been
sitting
collecting
stray
pencils
and
pieces
of
she
noticed
a
book
lying
on
the
floor
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
french
grammar
with
etta
jessop
written
on
the
and
had
evidently
been
accidentally
dropped
she
turned
over
the
pages
idly
in
the
middle
was
a
scrap
of
paper
torn
from
an
and
on
this
was
scribbled
where
will
she
be
while
in
a
different
hand
underneath
as
if
in
answer
to
the
question
were
the
words
side
gate
at
pass
barleycorn
this
was
most
important
it
was
the
first
indeed
the
only
definite
information
they
had
to
go
upon
lizzie
replaced
the
slip
of
paper
and
laid
the
book
on
the
floor
just
where
she
had
found
it
etta
would
no
doubt
soon
discover
her
loss
and
come
back
to
fetch
it
in
the
meantime
this
very
valuable
piece
of
news
must
be
communicated
to
ulyth
the
chums
talked
the
matter
over
earnestly
something
happening
at
the
side
gate
at
eight
and
got
a
password
that
clear
said
lizzie
then
i
think
it
our
plain
duty
to
go
and
investigate
returned
ulyth
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
we
could
report
ourselves
and
tell
teddie
why
we
went
she
understand
i
hope
it
wo
need
that
fluttered
lizzie
nervously
the
girls
were
not
allowed
out
of
the
house
after
preparation
so
any
excursions
into
the
garden
were
distinctly
against
the
rules
feeling
very
culpable
at
thus
breaking
the
law
of
the
school
ulyth
and
lizzie
crept
quietly
from
the
door
soon
after
eight
had
struck
it
was
not
yet
dark
but
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
hills
and
the
garden
was
in
deep
shadow
they
passed
the
and
the
rose
parterre
and
ran
down
the
steps
into
the
herbarium
just
at
the
outskirts
of
the
shrubbery
a
small
figure
was
skulking
among
the
bushes
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
it
gave
a
low
peculiar
whistle
then
advanced
slightly
from
the
shadow
and
stood
at
attention
as
if
in
mute
challenge
of
the
irene
scott
for
it
was
she
was
evidently
on
sentry
duty
no
one
with
a
knowledge
of
could
mistake
her
attitude
we
bluff
it
off
whispered
ulyth
and
taking
lizzie
arm
she
marched
quietly
past
murmuring
john
barleycorn
the
effect
of
the
password
was
electrical
irene
looked
immensely
astonished
she
had
certainly
not
expected
such
knowledge
on
the
part
of
seniors
are
you
in
it
too
oh
goody
she
gasped
then
very
softly
she
called
all
well
and
turning
dived
back
among
the
bushes
lizzie
and
ulyth
pushed
on
towards
the
side
gate
it
was
open
and
inside
under
the
shelter
of
a
big
laurel
stood
a
woman
with
a
basket
she
was
a
person
with
long
and
she
wore
a
handkerchief
tied
round
her
neck
as
the
girls
approached
she
uncovered
her
basket
with
a
knowing
smile
i
brought
plenty
missies
she
said
ingratiatingly
cheesecakes
and
vanilla
sandwiches
and
drops
and
cream
wafers
what
you
please
to
have
are
you
selling
them
asked
ulyth
in
much
amazement
the
woman
glanced
at
her
keenly
i
not
seen
you
two
before
she
remarked
yes
dearie
i
selling
them
they
wholesome
cakes
and
wo
do
you
any
harm
try
these
cream
wafers
no
thanks
we
do
want
anything
stammered
lizzie
if
you
spent
all
your
money
persisted
the
hawker
i
always
open
to
take
a
trinket
instead
there
a
young
lady
been
here
just
now
and
gave
me
this
in
place
of
a
sixpence
showing
a
small
brooch
pinned
into
her
bodice
of
course
such
things
are
worth
much
to
me
but
i
do
it
to
oblige
you
at
the
sight
of
the
little
brooch
ulyth
flushed
hotly
we
not
allowed
to
buy
cakes
and
tarts
she
replied
i
sure
miss
bowes
does
know
that
you
come
here
to
sell
things
it
not
your
fault
of
course
but
please
do
come
again
it
breaking
the
rules
of
the
school
the
woman
covered
up
her
basket
in
an
instant
all
right
missie
all
right
she
said
suavely
i
do
want
to
press
things
on
you
that
not
my
way
you
wo
catch
me
at
this
gate
again
i
promise
you
good
night
and
slipping
out
into
the
lane
she
was
gone
directly
ulyth
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
she
may
come
to
this
particular
spot
again
said
lizzie
but
she
find
some
other
the
cunning
old
thing
i
could
see
it
in
her
eye
so
this
is
their
grand
secret
what
a
remarkably
honourable
and
creditable
one
it
worse
than
i
thought
groaned
ulyth
they
must
have
been
going
on
with
this
business
for
some
time
lizzie
do
you
know
that
brooch
was
rona
i
recognized
it
at
once
it
one
she
brought
from
new
zealand
with
a
maori
device
on
it
i
thought
better
of
rona
so
did
i
she
improved
so
much
i
did
think
she
slip
back
in
this
way
i
believe
tootie
phillips
is
the
there
no
doubt
of
it
from
all
we
seen
the
juniors
have
got
a
systematic
traffic
with
this
woman
and
post
scouts
to
keep
watch
while
she
about
you
heard
irene
call
well
they
be
feasting
in
their
bedroom
rona
wo
dare
surely
lizzie
i
should
have
thought
much
of
it
if
they
done
it
once
just
for
a
lark
we
all
human
and
juniors
will
be
juniors
but
when
it
gets
systematic
and
they
begin
to
sell
their
brooches
that
a
different
matter
what
are
you
going
to
do
tackle
the
kids
and
tell
them
we
found
out
and
they
got
to
stop
it
will
they
really
stop
it
just
at
our
bidding
or
will
it
only
put
them
on
their
guard
and
make
them
carry
the
thing
on
with
more
caution
then
give
a
hint
to
the
monitresses
i
wonder
if
we
ought
i
wish
catherine
and
helen
were
different
well
what
do
you
suggest
there
only
one
other
way
arnold
is
coming
to
the
woodlands
on
friday
afternoon
suppose
we
wait
catch
her
alone
and
tell
her
all
about
it
she
our
of
the
fire
and
we
ought
to
be
able
to
ask
her
things
when
we
in
difficulties
she
does
belong
to
the
school
so
it
is
like
telling
a
teacher
or
a
monitress
we
know
we
can
trust
her
absolutely
but
it
seems
a
long
time
to
have
to
wait
it
ca
be
helped
said
ulyth
as
they
hurried
back
through
the
garden
she
had
decided
as
she
thought
for
the
best
though
as
the
result
proved
she
had
chosen
a
most
unfortunate
course
chapter
xvi
amateur
conjuring
ulyth
went
to
her
bedroom
that
evening
in
much
agitation
of
mind
she
was
torn
by
conflicting
impulses
at
one
moment
she
longed
to
tax
rona
frankly
with
a
breach
of
school
rules
air
the
whole
subject
and
state
her
most
emphatic
opinion
upon
it
if
rona
alone
had
been
concerned
in
the
matter
she
would
have
done
so
without
hesitation
but
the
knowledge
of
the
number
of
girls
who
were
involved
made
her
pause
i
might
do
more
harm
than
good
she
reflected
after
the
way
tootie
has
been
inciting
them
to
take
sides
against
the
seniors
they
be
up
in
arms
at
the
least
hint
it
will
be
worse
if
they
know
discovered
and
yet
go
on
in
an
even
more
underhand
fashion
ulyth
abstraction
was
so
marked
that
her
could
not
fail
to
notice
it
what
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
i
never
seen
you
so
glum
before
have
you
been
getting
into
a
row
with
teddie
i
all
right
one
ca
always
be
talking
i
suppose
returned
ulyth
rather
huffily
some
people
go
on
like
a
perpetual
gramophone
meaning
corona
margarita
mitchell
i
suppose
as
you
like
o
queen
i
shut
up
if
my
babble
offends
the
royal
ears
there
do
look
so
tragic
i
do
want
to
make
myself
a
nuisance
but
all
the
same
depressing
to
see
you
looking
like
a
mixture
of
hamlet
and
ophelia
and
iphigenia
and
and
don
quixote
was
he
tragic
too
i
forget
hardly
said
ulyth
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
well
i
get
mixed
up
among
history
and
literature
ca
always
remember
which
is
real
and
which
is
it
a
fact
i
put
down
portia
as
history
in
my
exercise
yesterday
and
said
the
story
of
the
spanish
armada
was
told
by
chaucer
now
you
laughing
and
you
look
more
like
ulyth
stanton
sit
down
on
this
bed
there
open
your
mouth
and
shut
your
eyes
and
see
what
the
king
will
send
you
rona
was
fumbling
in
her
drawer
as
she
spoke
she
turned
round
seized
her
friend
boisterously
and
forced
her
on
to
the
bed
then
holding
a
hand
over
her
eyes
crammed
a
chocolate
almond
into
her
mouth
rona
what
are
you
doing
protested
ulyth
shaking
herself
free
where
did
you
get
this
chocolate
rona
pulled
a
face
expressive
of
mingled
secrecy
delight
and
triumph
rats
she
chuckled
enigmatically
little
girls
should
ask
questions
but
i
want
to
know
that
not
sporty
take
the
goods
the
gods
send
you
and
do
ask
what
tree
they
picked
them
from
but
rona
are
you
two
girls
still
out
of
bed
and
talking
said
an
indignant
voice
as
miss
lodge
opened
the
door
and
glared
reproval
make
haste
i
give
you
three
minutes
and
if
you
not
ready
by
then
i
shall
report
you
not
another
word
i
astonished
at
you
ulyth
for
breaking
the
silence
rule
i
did
hear
the
nine
bell
replied
ulyth
abashed
then
it
your
business
to
hear
it
it
loud
enough
everybody
else
on
the
landing
is
in
bed
miss
lodge
put
out
the
light
and
walked
away
with
a
final
warning
against
further
conversation
rona
was
asleep
in
a
few
minutes
breathing
calmly
and
peacefully
as
was
her
wont
but
ulyth
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
watching
a
shadow
on
the
wall
cast
from
the
outside
where
had
rona
got
her
chocolates
the
answer
was
perfectly
plain
with
the
little
brooch
for
evidence
there
could
be
no
mistake
she
not
so
bad
as
the
others
because
i
really
do
think
she
quite
realizes
even
yet
what
school
honour
means
but
tootie
and
her
scouts
know
there
no
excuse
for
them
well
only
two
days
now
and
arnold
will
be
here
what
a
tower
of
strength
she
is
i
can
tell
her
everything
friday
will
very
soon
come
now
thank
goodness
but
those
two
days
were
to
bring
events
of
their
own
events
quite
unprecedented
in
the
school
and
unexpected
by
everybody
how
they
affected
ulyth
and
rona
will
be
related
farther
on
in
our
story
but
meantime
for
a
true
understanding
of
their
significance
we
must
pause
to
consider
a
certain
feature
of
the
life
at
the
woodlands
when
miss
teddington
had
joined
partnership
with
miss
bowes
she
had
added
many
new
ideas
to
the
plan
of
education
which
had
formerly
been
pursued
she
was
determined
that
the
school
should
not
be
dubbed
and
by
all
means
in
her
power
she
kept
it
abreast
of
the
times
so
well
did
she
succeed
that
the
girls
were
apt
to
complain
that
their
second
principal
was
a
crank
on
education
and
fond
of
trying
every
fresh
experiment
she
could
get
hold
of
the
various
enterprises
added
an
atmosphere
of
novelty
however
and
prevented
the
daily
life
from
degenerating
into
a
dull
routine
no
one
ever
knew
what
scheme
miss
teddington
might
suggest
next
and
even
if
each
course
was
not
pursued
for
very
long
it
did
its
work
at
the
time
and
was
a
factor
in
the
general
plan
all
kinds
and
varieties
of
health
exercises
had
had
their
day
at
the
woodlands
poles
clubs
had
been
in
turn
discarded
for
deep
breathing
or
for
swimming
motions
slow
minuets
or
lively
tarantellas
were
danced
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
moment
and
had
the
virtue
of
teaching
stately
dignity
as
well
as
poetry
of
motion
it
was
rumoured
sometimes
that
miss
teddington
with
her
eye
on
the
past
contemplated
a
revival
of
backboards
stocks
and
but
those
instruments
of
torture
fortunately
never
made
their
appearance
much
to
the
relief
of
the
intended
victims
who
had
viewed
their
advent
with
apprehension
naturally
dancing
and
indoor
went
on
mostly
in
the
winter
months
their
place
being
taken
by
outdoor
drill
during
the
summer
term
the
movement
had
appealed
to
miss
teddington
she
would
herself
have
liked
to
be
guardian
of
the
fire
and
general
organizer
of
the
league
but
her
better
judgment
told
her
it
was
wiser
to
leave
that
office
to
one
who
had
not
also
to
wield
the
authority
of
a
teacher
she
supported
the
league
in
every
way
that
came
within
her
province
as
honours
were
given
for
nature
study
astronomy
and
geology
she
took
care
that
all
had
a
chance
to
qualify
in
those
directions
and
lately
acting
on
a
hint
from
arnold
she
had
made
a
special
point
of
manual
training
since
christmas
the
studio
had
assumed
a
new
importance
in
the
school
it
was
a
big
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
reached
by
a
small
stair
from
the
west
bedroom
landing
a
carpenter
bench
stood
at
one
end
of
it
and
went
on
fairly
briskly
the
girls
might
come
in
at
any
time
during
their
recreation
hours
and
the
occupation
was
a
great
resource
on
wet
days
bookbinding
stencilling
clay
modelling
and
fretwork
were
included
among
the
hobbies
and
though
there
might
not
be
definite
lessons
given
there
were
handy
primers
of
instruction
on
the
and
it
was
interesting
to
try
experiments
do
something
on
your
own
initiative
take
the
book
and
puzzle
it
out
even
if
you
make
a
few
mistakes
urged
miss
teddington
nothing
but
practice
can
give
you
the
right
feel
of
your
tools
you
learn
more
from
a
couple
of
failures
than
from
a
week
work
with
a
teacher
at
your
elbow
the
whole
time
saying
so
the
girls
struggled
on
making
merry
at
each
other
often
rather
indifferent
efforts
but
gaining
more
skill
as
they
learnt
to
handle
the
materials
with
which
they
worked
if
the
mallet
hit
the
chisel
so
vigorously
as
to
spoil
a
part
of
the
pattern
its
wielder
was
wiser
next
time
and
the
experimenters
in
pyrography
soon
learned
that
a
needle
used
indiscreetly
can
dig
holes
in
leather
instead
of
ornamenting
it
such
dufferisms
as
the
girls
called
them
became
rarer
and
many
quite
creditable
objects
were
turned
out
and
judged
worthy
of
a
temporary
place
on
the
since
christmas
a
very
special
feature
had
been
added
to
the
handicraft
department
miss
teddington
had
caused
apparatus
to
be
fixed
for
the
working
of
art
jewellery
a
furnace
and
a
high
bench
with
all
necessary
equipment
had
been
duly
installed
this
was
a
branch
much
too
technically
difficult
for
the
girls
to
attempt
alone
so
a
skilled
teacher
had
been
procured
who
came
weekly
from
elwyn
bay
to
give
lessons
those
girls
who
took
the
course
became
intensely
enthusiastic
over
it
to
make
even
a
simple
chain
was
interesting
but
when
they
advanced
to
setting
polished
pebbles
or
imitation
stones
as
brooches
or
pendants
the
work
waxed
fascinating
some
of
the
students
proved
much
more
adept
than
others
and
turned
out
really
pretty
things
there
was
not
apparatus
for
many
pupils
to
work
so
the
class
had
been
limited
to
seniors
among
whom
doris
deane
ruth
white
and
stephanie
radford
had
begun
to
distinguish
themselves
each
had
made
a
small
pendant
and
while
the
craftsmanship
might
be
amateurish
the
general
effect
was
artistic
miss
teddington
was
delighted
and
wishing
to
air
her
latest
hobby
she
decided
to
send
the
three
pendants
together
with
some
other
specimens
of
school
handiwork
to
a
small
art
exhibition
which
was
to
be
held
shortly
at
elwyn
bay
miss
edwards
the
teacher
who
came
weekly
to
give
instruction
was
on
the
exhibition
committee
and
promised
to
devote
a
certain
case
to
the
articles
and
place
them
in
a
good
light
though
small
shows
had
been
held
at
the
woodlands
occasionally
in
connection
with
the
annual
prize
distribution
the
school
had
never
before
ventured
to
send
a
contribution
to
a
public
exhibition
and
those
whose
work
was
to
be
thus
honoured
became
heroines
of
the
moment
on
the
very
evening
after
ulyth
and
lizzie
excursion
down
the
garden
a
number
of
girls
repaired
to
the
studio
to
view
the
objects
that
miss
teddington
had
chosen
as
worthy
to
represent
the
artistic
side
of
the
school
i
wish
i
were
a
senior
said
winnie
fowler
plaintively
i
have
loved
this
sort
of
thing
to
think
of
being
able
to
make
a
little
darling
ducky
brooch
it
beats
drawing
hollow
i
never
want
to
touch
a
pencil
again
you
got
to
have
some
eye
for
drawing
though
said
doris
or
have
your
things
all
crooked
it
not
as
easy
as
eating
chocolates
i
can
tell
you
i
dare
say
but
i
try
some
day
when
i
am
a
senior
are
these
the
three
that
are
to
go
to
the
exhibition
asked
rona
pushing
her
way
to
the
front
which
is
which
this
is
mine
that
ruth
and
that
stephanie
explained
doris
why
is
ulyth
to
go
it
just
as
nice
as
stephanie
i
sure
miss
teddington
decided
that
how
idiotic
of
her
why
could
she
send
ulyth
i
think
hers
is
the
nicest
and
it
just
the
same
pattern
as
stephie
exactly
do
be
quiet
rona
urged
ulyth
laying
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
her
too
partial
friend
my
pendant
has
a
defect
in
it
i
bungled
and
get
it
right
again
afterwards
it
does
show
not
to
you
perhaps
but
any
judge
of
such
things
would
notice
in
a
moment
well
your
work
as
good
as
stephanie
any
day
and
i
hate
for
her
name
to
be
put
into
the
catalogue
and
not
yours
yes
i
mean
what
i
say
oh
rona
do
hush
i
do
want
my
name
in
a
catalogue
here
stephie
coming
in
do
let
her
hear
you
i
do
mind
if
she
does
it
wo
do
her
any
harm
to
hear
frank
opinion
rona
if
you
care
one
atom
for
me
stop
rather
grumbling
rona
allowed
herself
to
be
suppressed
she
was
always
ready
to
throw
a
shaft
at
stephanie
though
she
knew
ulyth
heartily
disliked
the
scenes
which
invariably
followed
she
took
up
pendant
however
and
after
ostentatiously
admiring
it
laid
it
for
a
moment
side
by
side
with
stephanie
there
is
a
pin
to
choose
between
them
she
murmured
under
her
breath
hoping
stephanie
might
overhear
ulyth
was
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
but
stephanie
quick
ears
caught
the
whisper
she
looked
daggers
at
rona
but
she
made
no
remark
and
ulyth
returning
gently
took
her
pendant
away
and
placed
it
with
the
other
on
the
bench
it
had
been
a
wet
afternoon
no
outdoor
exercise
had
been
possible
that
day
and
the
girls
were
tired
of
all
their
usual
indoor
occupations
i
wish
somebody
suggest
something
new
to
cheer
us
up
yawned
nellie
barlow
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
it
too
short
to
be
worth
while
getting
out
any
apparatus
but
it
long
enough
to
be
deadly
dull
ca
someone
do
some
tricks
asked
edie
maycock
all
right
toby
sit
on
your
hind
legs
and
beg
for
biscuits
laughed
marjorie
earnshaw
i
mean
real
tricks
conjuring
and
fortune
telling
the
amateur
wizard
you
know
i
do
know
then
you
stupid

you
never
seen
amateur
conjuring
coins
that
vanish
and
things
that
come
out
of
hats

but
i
could
do
it
my
good
child
being
in
the
sixth
make
me
a
magician
we
tried
a
little
bit
at
home
pursued
edie
we
had
a
book
that
told
us
how
only
i
never
could
manage
it
quickly
people
always
saw
how
i
did
it
rona
the
girl
for
that
suggested
hattie
goodwin
is
she
come
here
rona
i
want
you
can
you
really
and
truly
do
conjuring
oh
not
properly
laughed
rona
but
when
i
was
on
board
ship
there
was
a
gentleman
who
was
very
clever
at
it
and
i
and
some
boys
i
made
friends
with
were
tremendously
keen
at
learning
we
got
him
to
show
us
a
few
easy
tricks
and
we
were
always
trying
them
i
could
manage
it
just
a
little
but
i
out
of
practice
now
you
see
in
a
second
how
it
was
done
i
afraid
oh
do
show
us
just
for
fun
what
do
you
want
to
see
oh
anything
the
vanishing
coin
yes
yes
go
ahead
then
give
me
two
pennies
or
shillings
either
will
do
the
audience
who
had
clustered
round
looked
at
one
another
each
expecting
somebody
else
to
produce
a
coin
then
everybody
laughed
we
have
got
so
much
as
a
copper
amongst
us
we
a
set
of
absolute
paupers
declared
doris
ca
you
do
some
other
trick
there
is
nothing
else
i
could
manage
so
well
said
rona
disconsolately
this
was
the
only
one
i
really
learnt
ca
it
be
done
with
anything
but
coins
something
the
same
size
and
round
perhaps
my
pendant
said
ulyth
fetching
the
trinket
from
the
bench
just
as
big
as
a
penny
yes
i
could
try
it
with
this
and
another
like
it
give
me
stephanie
no
no
you
sha
try
tricks
with
mine
objected
stephanie
indignantly
i
wo
do
it
a
scrap
of
harm
oh
stephie
do
be
mean
she
not
hurt
it
here
rona
take
it
exclaimed
several
of
the
girls
anxious
to
witness
the
experiment
stephanie
protests
and
grumbles
were
overridden
by
the
majority
and
rona
in
her
new
capacity
of
wizard
faced
her
audience
it
be
rather
transparent
because
you
ought
really
to
know
that
i
got
two
pendants
she
explained
apologetically
please
forget
and
think
it
only
one
i
must
put
some
patter
in
like
thompson
always
used
to
do
ladies
and
gentleman
you
no
doubt
heard
that
the
art
of
conjuring
depends
upon
the
quickness
of
the
hand
that
as
it
may
be
but
there
is
a
great
deal
that
ca
be
accounted
for
in
that
way
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
see
this
coin
or
rather
pendant
as
i
should
say
i
am
going
to
make
it
fly
from
my
left
hand
to
my
right
one
two
three
pass
here
it
is
did
you
see
it
go
no
well
i
can
make
it
travel
pretty
quickly
now
we
try
another
pretty
little
experiment
you
see
my
hand
it
empty
is
it
yet
when
i
wave
it
over
this
desk
miss
stephanie
radford
pendant
will
be
returned
to
its
place
hey
presto
pass
there
you
are
safe
and
sound
and
back
again
stephanie
took
up
her
treasure
and
examined
it
anxiously
this
is
mine
she
declared
rubbish
it
is
i
tell
you
it
is
do
i
know
my
own
work
this
is
ulyth
what
have
you
done
with
mine
vanished
under
the
wizard
wand
mocked
rona
give
it
me
this
instant
cried
stephanie
angrily
shaking
rona
by
the
arm
rona
had
been
standing
upon
one
leg
and
the
unexpected
assault
completely
upset
her
balance
she
toppled
clutched
at
doris
and
fell
bumping
her
head
against
the
corner
of
the
table
it
was
a
hard
blow
and
as
she
got
up
she
staggered
i
feel
all
dizzy
she
gasped
an
officious
junior
quite
unnecessarily
ran
for
miss
lodge
magnifying
the
accident
so
much
in
her
highly
coloured
account
that
the
mistress
arrived
on
the
scene
prepared
to
find
rona
stretched
unconscious
seeing
that
the
girl
looked
white
and
tearful
she
ordered
her
promptly
to
bed
it
may
be
nothing
but
any
rate
you
will
be
better
lying
down
she
decreed
go
downstairs
girls
all
of
you
nobody
is
to
come
into
the
studio
again
rona
had
my
pendant
in
her
hand
all
the
time
grumbled
stephanie
to
beth
as
she
obeyed
the
mistress
orders
she
dropped
it
as
she
fell
i
put
it
back
safely
though
and
i
do
mean
to
let
anybody
interfere
with
it
i
shall
complain
to
miss
bowes
if
it
touched
again
chapter
xvii
a
rona
woke
up
next
morning
without
even
a
headache
in
miss
opinion
justifying
the
prompt
measures
taken
but
according
to
the
girls
showing
there
had
been
nothing
the
matter
with
her
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
breakfast
proceeded
as
usual
and
afterwards
came
the
short
interval
before
school
now
on
this
day
the
contributions
to
the
art
exhibition
were
to
be
packed
up
and
dispatched
by
a
special
carrier
and
stephanie
as
a
budding
metalworker
ran
upstairs
to
the
studio
to
take
one
last
peep
at
her
exhibit
she
flew
down
again
with
white
face
and
burning
eyes
girls
she
cried
shakily
girls
somebody
taken
my
pendant
gone
why
nonsense
stephie
it
ca
be
gone
it
was
there
all
right
last
night
it
not
there
now
ulyth
has
been
put
in
its
place
and
vanished
come
and
see
there
was
an
instant
stampede
for
the
studio
it
probably
on
the
bench
said
doris
some
people
are
such
bad
lookers
i
expect
we
shall
find
it
directly
you
ca
find
a
thing
that
is
there
retorted
stephanie
with
warmth
doris
considered
herself
an
excellent
looker
and
in
company
with
a
dozen
others
she
searched
the
studio
willing
hands
turned
everything
over
hunted
under
tables
on
shelves
and
among
shavings
but
not
a
sign
of
the
pendant
could
they
find
are
you
sure
this
one
is
yours
asked
ruth
coming
back
to
the
exhibits
certain
i
know
my
own
work
this
is
ulyth
and
there
the
mistake
she
made
that
disqualified
it
yours
was
put
back
last
night
i
saw
it
safe
myself
after
rona
been
juggling
with
it
where
is
rona
i
believe
she
at
the
bottom
of
this
she
in
the
garden
then
she
must
be
fetched
what
the
matter
what
are
you
making
a
bother
about
cried
rona
as
an
excited
detachment
of
girls
stopped
her
game
of
tennis
and
asked
her
a
dozen
questions
at
once
what
have
i
done
with
stephanie
pendant
why
i
done
nothing
with
it
of
course
but
you
must
have
hidden
it
somewhere
it
a
mean
trick
to
play
on
her
you
and
steph
are
always
at
daggers
drawn
do
go
and
put
it
back
i
ca
think
what
you
talking
about
flared
rona
i
not
even
been
inside
the
studio
if
a
joke
being
played
on
stephanie
somebody
else
who
doing
it
not
me
for
goodness
sake
let
me
get
on
with
my
game
come
winnie
it
your
serve
the
girls
retired
whispering
to
one
another
they
were
not
at
all
satisfied
the
news
of
the
loss
spread
rapidly
over
the
school
and
had
soon
reached
the
ears
of
the
authorities
miss
lodge
who
heard
it
from
a
monitress
at
once
sought
miss
bowes
study
a
few
moments
later
she
went
in
a
hurry
to
summon
miss
teddington
and
a
rash
junior
who
ventured
within
earshot
was
sent
away
with
a
scolding
miss
bowes
looked
grave
as
she
walked
into
the
hall
for
she
took
the
names
as
usual
then
instead
of
dismissing
the
forms
she
paused
impressively
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
girls
she
began
in
a
strained
voice
a
most
unpleasant
thing
has
happened
this
morning
the
pendant
made
by
stephanie
radford
which
was
to
have
been
sent
to
the
elwyn
bay
exhibition
has
disappeared
and
ulyth
stanton
pendant
has
been
substituted
for
it
it
is
i
suppose
a
practical
joke
on
the
part
of
one
of
you
now
i
highly
disapprove
of
this
foolish
form
of
jesting
it
is
neither
clever
nor
funny
and
is
often
very
unkind
i
beg
whoever
has
done
this
thing
to
come
forward
at
once
and
replace
the
pendant
she
need
have
no
fear
for
she
will
not
be
punished
or
even
scolded
though
she
must
give
me
her
word
never
to
repeat
such
a
prank
miss
bowes
stopped
and
looked
expectantly
at
the
rows
of
intent
eyes
fixed
upon
her
nobody
spoke
and
nobody
moved
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
hall
the
principal
flushed
with
annoyance
girls
must
i
appeal
to
your
honour
is
that
necessary
at
the
woodlands
have
i
actually
one
among
you
so
lacking
in
moral
courage
that
she
dare
not
own
up
i
repeat
that
she
will
meet
with
no
reproof
nothing
more
will
be
said
about
the
matter
still
no
reply
each
girl
looked
at
her
neighbour
but
not
even
a
whisper
was
to
be
heard
girls
i
am
exceedingly
pained
such
a
thing
has
never
happened
here
before
for
the
sake
of
the
school
i
make
one
last
appeal
to
you
will
nobody
speak
then
i
shall
be
obliged
to
ask
each
of
you
in
turn
what
she
knows
it
was
a
dreary
business
putting
the
same
question
to
girls
receiving
one
after
another
decided
negatives
miss
bowes
sighed
wearily
as
it
came
to
an
end
and
turned
to
miss
teddington
who
had
sat
on
the
platform
silent
but
frowning
during
the
ordeal
we
can
not
let
it
rest
here
certainly
not
snapped
miss
teddington
firmly
the
matter
must
be
sifted
to
the
bottom
the
two
principals
conferred
for
a
moment
in
whispers
then
miss
bowes
announced
girls
this
affair
must
be
very
carefully
inquired
into
i
hoped
it
was
only
a
practical
joke
but
a
circumstance
came
to
my
knowledge
last
night
which
i
fear
may
lend
a
more
sinister
aspect
to
it
than
either
miss
teddington
or
i
had
imagined
i
am
most
deeply
disappointed
that
the
code
of
honour
which
we
have
always
upheld
at
the
woodlands
seems
by
some
of
you
to
have
been
broken
i
shall
have
more
to
say
to
you
later
on
in
the
meantime
you
may
go
to
your
classrooms
very
solemnly
the
girls
turned
to
march
in
their
separate
forms
from
the
hall
but
as
iv
b
filed
through
the
door
there
was
a
sudden
outcry
a
hustling
a
rush
of
other
girls
and
an
excited
aghast
crowd
it
here
it
here
miss
bowes
shouted
doris
deane
rona
mitchell
had
it
it
fell
from
her
blouse
pocket
when
she
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
it
rona
we
saw
it
fall
she
had
it
all
the
time
oh
the
sneak
silence
thundered
miss
bowes
ringing
her
bell
in
the
midst
of
the
sudden
hush
the
principal
walked
down
the
hall
and
took
the
pendant
from
doris
hand
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
rona
mitchell
rona
was
standing
staring
as
if
a
ghost
had
suddenly
risen
up
and
confronted
her
her
vermilion
colour
had
faded
and
left
her
face
deadly
white
rona
do
you
hear
me
rona
shivered
slightly
glanced
desperately
at
miss
bowes
then
cast
her
eyes
on
the
floor
she
did
not
attempt
to
reply
i
give
you
one
more
chance
rona
oh
rona
interrupted
ulyth
who
was
weeping
hot
tears
of
dismay
remember
the
for
the
sake
of
the
school
rona
she
drew
back
choking
with
emotion
as
miss
bowes
waved
her
aside
rona
gazed
for
a
moment
full
at
ulyth
a
long
long
searching
gaze
as
if
she
would
read
ulyth
very
soul
in
her
eyes
then
the
colour
flooded
back
a
full
tide
of
crimson
over
brow
and
neck
yes
for
the
sake
of
the
school
she
repeated
unsteadily
and
bursting
into
tears
hid
her
burning
face
in
her
hands
miss
teddington
hastily
dismissed
the
other
girls
and
coming
to
the
assistance
of
her
partner
asked
many
questions
it
was
absolutely
useless
for
rona
would
not
answer
a
single
word
go
to
your
bedroom
said
the
irate
principal
at
last
this
matter
can
not
be
allowed
to
pass
if
you
had
owned
up
at
once
nothing
would
have
been
said
but
such
duplicity
and
obstinacy
are
unpardonable
until
you
make
a
full
confession
you
must
not
mix
with
the
rest
of
the
school
we
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
send
you
back
to
new
zealand
but
girls
with
no
sense
of
honour
can
not
remain
at
the
woodlands
still
sobbing
hysterically
rona
was
policed
upstairs
by
miss
teddington
and
locked
into
her
bedroom
an
hour
or
two
of
solitude
might
bring
her
to
her
senses
thought
the
mistress
and
break
the
stubborn
spirit
which
seemed
at
present
to
possess
her
a
wide
experience
of
girls
had
proved
that
solitary
confinement
soon
quelled
insubordination
and
by
the
culprit
would
probably
volunteer
some
explanation
both
principals
were
greatly
upset
by
the
occurrence
hitherto
the
little
world
at
the
woodlands
had
jogged
on
without
any
more
desperate
happenings
than
the
breaking
of
silence
rules
or
the
omission
of
practising
never
in
all
its
annals
had
they
been
obliged
to
deal
with
a
case
of
such
serious
import
ulyth
with
the
rest
of
v
b
was
obliged
to
march
off
to
her
the
inquiry
had
delayed
the
morning
work
and
miss
harding
began
to
give
out
books
without
a
moment
further
waste
of
time
ulyth
sat
staring
at
the
problem
set
her
without
in
the
least
taking
in
its
details
she
could
not
apply
her
mind
to
the
calculation
of
cubic
contents
while
rona
was
crying
her
heart
out
upstairs
what
did
it
what
could
it
all
mean
had
her
only
been
intending
to
play
a
practical
joke
on
stephanie
if
so
why
had
she
not
at
once
admitted
the
fact
nobody
would
have
thought
much
the
worse
of
her
for
it
as
such
jokes
had
been
rather
the
rage
of
late
among
the
juniors
it
seemed
so
unlike
rona
to
conceal
it
lack
of
candour
had
not
been
her
fault
hitherto
she
was
generally
proud
of
the
silly
tricks
she
was
fond
of
playing
and
anxious
to
boast
about
them
she
could
not
have
been
deterred
by
dread
of
the
principals
displeasure
only
yesterday
she
had
marched
into
the
study
to
report
herself
for
talking
with
a
sangfroid
that
was
the
admiration
of
her
form
and
had
come
out
again
smiling
with
the
comment
that
both
the
rainbow
and
teddie
were
as
decent
as
anything
if
one
owned
up
straight
no
there
must
be
another
and
a
much
graver
explanation
a
chain
of
circumstances
flashed
through
ulyth
mind
each
unfortunate
link
fitting
only
too
well
the
evidence
seemed
almost
overwhelming
rona
had
been
present
at
the
meeting
by
the
stream
when
tootie
incited
the
juniors
to
some
secret
act
of
rebellion
against
the
school
rules
what
this
act
was
the
occurrence
in
the
garden
had
plainly
shown
that
rona
had
been
implicated
seemed
a
matter
of
certainty
her
brooch
had
been
in
the
possession
of
the
and
she
had
chocolates
in
her
bedroom
the
acquisition
of
which
she
had
refused
to
explain
did
she
intend
to
keep
the
pendant
and
exchange
it
for
confectionery
her
as
ulyth
knew
was
exhausted
and
she
had
hardly
any
of
the
trinkets
that
most
girls
wear
ulyth
stanton
you
are
not
attending
to
your
work
give
me
your
answer
to
problem
ulyth
started
guiltily
her
page
was
still
a
blank
and
she
had
no
answer
to
produce
she
murmured
a
lame
excuse
and
miss
harding
glared
at
her
witheringly
thrusting
her
preoccupation
resolutely
aside
she
made
an
effort
to
concentrate
her
thoughts
upon
the
subject
in
hand
the
morning
passed
slowly
on
to
ulyth
each
successive
class
seemed
interminable
at
recreation
the
girls
in
small
clumps
discussed
the
one
topic
of
the
hour
i
not
surprised
i
think
anything
of
rona
mitchell
said
stephanie
what
else
could
you
expect
of
a
girl
from
the
backwoods
but
she
was
so
much
improved
urged
addie
who
had
rather
a
weakness
for
the
cuckoo
only
a
veneer
she
relapsed
directly
she
got
the
chance
you
see
but
why
should
she
take
your
pendant
i
ca
pretend
to
explain
her
motive
but
take
it
she
did
stealing
i
should
call
it
but
we
too
polite
at
the
woodlands
to
use
such
a
strong
word
what
be
done
to
her
pack
her
back
to
new
zealand
i
hope
and
a
good
riddance
i
always
said
she
was
a
suitable
girl
to
come
to
this
school
she
has
the
traditions
of
a
lady
you
might
as
well
try
to
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
as
to
get
such
a
girl
to
realize
the
meaning
of
it
birth
that
counts
after
all
when
it
comes
to
the
test
there
i
think
you
wrong
stephie
put
in
lizzie
quietly
gentle
birth
is
all
very
well
if
it
involves
preserving
a
code
of
honour
but
in
itself
it
no
of
character
some
of
the
humblest
and
poorest
people
have
been
the
stanchest
on
a
question
of
right
when
those
above
them
in
station
have
failed
utterly
a
charwoman
can
have
quite
as
high
standards
as
a
duchess
and
often
lives
up
to
them
much
better
oh
you
a
radical
i
want
fair
play
all
round
and
i
must
say
that
rona
has
been
very
straight
and
square
so
far
nobody
has
ever
accused
her
of
sneaking
no
the
bear
cub
was
unpolished
but
not
a
vicious
little
beastie
agreed
addie
and
it
had
grown
wonderfully
tame
of
late
added
christine
rona
did
not
appear
at
the
she
had
been
removed
from
her
own
bedroom
to
a
small
spare
room
on
another
landing
she
still
refused
to
answer
any
question
put
to
her
her
silence
seemed
unaccountable
and
the
principals
could
only
consider
it
as
a
display
of
temper
she
was
annoyed
at
being
caught
with
the
pendant
in
her
possession
and
she
wo
give
in
and
acknowledge
her
wrongdoing
said
miss
teddington
to
miss
bowes
from
a
strong
hint
cook
gave
me
last
night
i
fear
there
is
something
more
behind
it
all
returned
her
partner
i
shall
question
every
girl
in
the
school
separately
until
i
get
at
the
truth
beginning
with
the
monitresses
miss
bowes
summoned
each
pupil
in
turn
to
her
study
and
subjected
her
to
a
very
strict
catechism
from
the
sixth
she
gained
no
information
they
formed
a
clique
amongst
themselves
and
knew
little
of
the
doings
of
the
younger
girls
v
a
were
likewise
absorbed
in
their
own
interests
and
only
classed
rona
as
one
among
many
juniors
it
was
now
the
turn
of
v
b
and
miss
bowes
sent
for
ulyth
a
trifle
more
hopefully
she
at
least
would
have
an
intimate
knowledge
of
her
have
you
ever
known
rona
mixed
up
in
any
deceit
before
what
is
her
general
report
among
her
asked
the
principal
very
square
she
used
to
annoy
me
dreadfully
when
first
she
came
by
turning
over
all
my
things
but
she
soon
stopped
when
i
told
her
how
horrid
it
was
she
never
dreamt
of
taking
anything
it
was
the
merest
curiosity
she
had
been
taught
differently
at
home
have
you
found
her
eating
sweets
or
cakes
in
her
bedroom
lately
ulyth
hesitated
and
blushed
ah
i
see
you
have
you
must
tell
me
ulyth
keep
nothing
back
very
unwilling
to
betray
her
friend
ulyth
admitted
the
fact
that
chocolate
had
been
pressed
upon
her
one
evening
did
rona
explain
where
she
got
it
no
she
would
tell
me
anything
miss
bowes
looked
thoughtful
i
put
you
upon
your
honour
ulyth
to
answer
this
question
perfectly
frankly
have
you
any
reason
to
suspect
that
some
of
the
juniors
have
surreptitiously
been
buying
cakes
and
sweets
thus
asked
ulyth
was
obliged
to
relate
what
she
had
overheard
and
miss
bowes
determined
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
business
her
closely
until
she
had
dragged
from
her
reluctant
pupil
the
account
of
the
occurrence
in
the
garden
and
the
conversation
with
the
travelling
this
is
more
serious
even
than
i
had
feared
groaned
miss
bowes
i
thought
i
could
have
trusted
my
girls
i
think
most
of
them
were
ashamed
of
it
ventured
ulyth
it
is
just
possible
that
rona
refuses
to
speak
because
she
will
not
involve
her
schoolfellows
oh
yes
yes
cried
ulyth
clutching
at
any
straw
to
excuse
her
conduct
that
quite
likely
or
miss
bowes
i
been
thinking
that
perhaps
it
was
a
queer
kind
of
loyalty
to
me
you
know
rona
very
fond
of
me
and
she
was
quite
absurdly
angry
because
stephanie
pendant
was
to
go
to
the
exhibition
and
not
mine
she
may
have
changed
them
hoping
it
would
be
noticed
and
that
mine
would
be
packed
up
and
perhaps
she
intended
to
put
stephanie
back
in
the
studio
when
the
parcel
had
safely
gone
rona
does
such
impulsive
things
miss
bowes
shook
her
head
sadly
i
wish
i
could
think
so
unfortunately
the
other
circumstances
lend
suspicion
to
a
graver
motive
chapter
xviii
light
ulyth
walked
from
the
study
feeling
that
she
had
told
far
more
than
she
wished
i
given
rona
away
she
said
to
herself
miss
bowes
is
thinking
the
very
worst
of
her
i
know
oh
dear
i
wish
she
explain
and
not
keep
up
this
dreadful
silence
it
so
unlike
her
she
generally
almost
too
ready
to
talk
if
i
could
see
her
even
for
a
few
minutes
i
believe
she
would
tell
me
perhaps
miss
teddington
frightened
her
poor
rona
she
must
be
so
utterly
miserable
could
i
possibly
get
a
word
with
her
i
wonder
she
talked
the
matter
over
with
lizzie
if
i
ask
miss
bowes
she
probably
say
no
lamented
ulyth
then
i
should
ask
returned
lizzie
we
not
been
definitely
forbidden
to
see
rona
the
door
locked
you
only
to
climb
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
roof
of
the
veranda
why
so
i
could
oh
i
must
speak
to
her
i
think
you
are
justified
if
you
can
get
anything
out
of
her
tell
you
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
whole
school
i
try
my
luck
then
i
stand
in
the
garden
below
and
shout
if
i
hear
anyone
coming
to
help
her
unfortunate
seemed
the
first
consideration
to
ulyth
and
she
thought
the
end
certainly
justified
the
means
she
waited
until
after
the
tea
interval
when
most
of
the
girls
would
be
playing
tennis
or
walking
in
the
glade
then
making
sure
that
lizzie
was
watching
in
the
garden
below
she
stole
upstairs
to
the
it
was
quite
easy
to
drop
from
the
window
on
to
the
top
of
the
veranda
and
not
very
difficult
in
spite
of
the
slope
to
walk
along
to
the
end
of
the
roof
here
an
angle
of
the
old
part
of
the
house
jutted
out
and
the
open
window
of
rona
prison
faced
her
only
a
couple
of
yards
away
she
could
not
reach
across
the
gap
but
conversation
would
be
perfectly
possible
rona
she
called
cautiously
rona
there
was
a
movement
inside
the
room
and
a
face
appeared
at
the
window
rona
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
with
crying
and
her
hair
hung
in
wild
disorder
at
the
sight
of
ulyth
she
started
and
stared
rather
defiantly
rona
rona
dear
i
been
longing
to
see
you
i
felt
i
must
speak
to
you
no
reply
rona
in
fact
turned
her
back
i
so
dreadfully
sorry
continued
ulyth
i
been
thinking
about
you
all
day
it
no
use
keeping
this
up
do
confess
and
have
done
with
it
rona
twisted
round
suddenly
and
faced
ulyth
rona
you
be
so
much
happier
if
you
own
up
you
taken
it
surely
you
only
meant
it
as
a
joke
on
stephie
miss
bowes
will
forgive
you
for
the
sake
of
the
school
do
then
rona
spoke
you
ask
me
to
confess
you
of
all
people
she
exclaimed
with
unconcealed
bitterness
yes
dear
i
ca
urge
it
too
strongly
you
want
me
to
tell
miss
bowes
that
i
took
that
pendant
there
no
sense
in
concealing
it
rona
the
cuckoo
eyes
blazed
her
hands
gripped
the
oh
this
is
too
much
it
the
limit
i
could
have
believed
it
possible
you
ulyth
you
to
ask
me
this
how
can
you
how
dare
you
ulyth
gazed
at
her
in
perplexity
she
could
not
understand
such
an
outburst
surely
i
your
own
chum
have
the
best
right
to
speak
to
you
for
your
own
good
my
own
good
repeated
rona
witheringly
yours
you
mean
oh
yes
all
very
fine
for
you
no
doubt
you
to
get
off
scot
free
i
what
are
you
talking
about
do
pretend
you
do
understand
you
atrocious
sneak
and
hypocrite
you
took
the
pendant
yourself
if
she
had
been
accused
of
purloining
the
crown
jewels
from
the
tower
of
london
ulyth
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
i
she
stammered
i
yes
you
and
you
know
it
i
saw
you
you
could
but
i
did
or
as
good
as
saw
you
who
came
into
our
room
last
night
i
should
like
to
know
when
miss
lodge
had
sent
me
to
bed
and
slipped
something
into
one
of
the
blouses
hanging
behind
the
door
i
forgotten
by
the
morning
but
i
remembered
when
the
pendant
came
jerking
out
of
my
pocket
certainly
i
did
put
it
there
but
you
did
you
came
into
the
room
took
off
your
outdoor
coat
and
threw
it
on
your
bed
i
got
up
afterwards
and
hung
it
up
in
your
wardrobe
for
you
irene
told
me
how
you
joined
the
cake
club
she
said
you
had
the
password
quite
pat
ulyth
was
too
aghast
to
answer
rona
once
she
had
broken
silence
continued
in
a
torrent
of
indignation
you
a
you
might
well
ask
me
not
to
expose
you
the
you
said
yes
it
because
of
the
and
for
the
sake
of
the
school
that
i
kept
your
secret
do
be
afraid
not
going
to
tell
it
would
be
good
for
the
league
if
a
toppled
down
so
low
it
does
matter
so
much
for
only
a
i
wo
betray
a
chum
i
brought
that
much
honour
from
the
bush
but
i
let
you
know
what
i
think
about
you
at
any
rate
then
her
blaze
of
passion
suddenly
fading
she
burst
into
tears
ulyth
ulyth
how
could
you
she
sobbed
you
who
taught
me
everything
that
was
good
i
believed
in
you
so
utterly
i
never
have
thought
it
of
you
oh
why
cave
cave
shouted
lizzie
excitedly
below
cave
teddie
herself
ulyth
turned
and
fled
with
more
regard
for
speed
than
safety
along
the
veranda
roof
and
scrambled
through
the
window
into
the
again
she
was
trembling
with
agitation
such
an
extraordinary
development
of
the
situation
was
as
appalling
as
it
was
unexpected
she
must
have
time
to
think
it
over
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
to
anybody
about
it
at
present
not
even
to
lizzie
no
she
must
be
alone
she
ran
quickly
downstairs
and
before
lizzie
had
time
to
find
her
dived
under
the
laurels
of
the
shrubbery
and
made
her
way
first
down
the
garden
and
then
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
paddock
that
adjoined
the
high
road
there
was
a
little
copse
here
of
trees
and
low
bushes
which
sheltered
her
from
all
observation
nobody
was
likely
to
come
and
disturb
her
for
the
girls
preferred
the
glade
and
seldom
troubled
to
enter
the
paddock
she
flung
herself
down
on
the
grass
and
tried
to
face
the
matter
calmly
she
had
begged
rona
to
confess
and
rona
in
return
had
accused
her
of
taking
the
pendant
this
was
turning
the
tables
with
a
vengeance
how
could
her
have
become
possessed
of
such
a
preposterous
idea
and
in
what
a
web
of
mystery
the
affair
seemed
involved
one
certainty
came
as
an
immense
relief
rona
was
not
guilty
more
than
this
she
was
behaving
with
an
extraordinary
amount
of
courage
and
loyalty
she
believes
i
took
it
and
yet
she
is
bearing
all
the
blame
and
shielding
me
for
the
sake
of
the
school
groaned
ulyth
oh
what
must
she
be
thinking
of
me
we
all
at
did
she
really
fancy
that
when
i
said
the
i
was
begging
her
to
screen
me
somebody
took
the
pendant
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
that
the
ugly
part
of
the
business
it
throwing
the
blame
from
one
to
another
what
we
got
to
do
is
to
find
out
the
real
guilty
person
and
that
not
going
to
be
easy
i
afraid
ulyth
sighed
and
wiped
her
eyes
she
had
been
deeply
hurt
at
sudden
attack
it
is
humiliating
to
find
that
where
you
occupied
a
pedestal
you
are
now
even
temporarily
a
broken
idol
she
right
to
scorn
me
if
she
imagines
i
such
a
sneak
but
how
could
she
suppose
i
would
and
yet
i
thought
her
guilty
oh
dear
it
a
horrible
muddle
how
shall
we
ever
get
it
straight
ulyth
sat
thinking
thinking
and
was
no
nearer
to
a
solution
of
her
problem
when
she
suddenly
heard
the
brisk
ringing
of
a
on
the
road
below
springing
up
eagerly
she
rushed
to
the
wall
and
shouted
just
in
time
to
stop
arnold
whose
machine
was
whisking
past
hallo
ulyth
what
are
you
doing
there
i
coming
over
do
please
wait
for
me
and
ulyth
scrambling
somehow
across
the
wall
slid
down
a
gravelly
bank
on
to
the
road
you
the
one
person
in
the
world
i
want
to
see
she
added
hugging
her
friend
impetuously
oh
arnold
the
most
dreadful
things
have
been
happening
at
school
somebody
took
stephie
pendant
and
it
fell
out
of
rona
pocket
and
everybody
thinks
rona
took
it
and
rona
thinks
it
me
what
are
we
to
do
sit
down
here
and
tell
me
all
about
it
yes
please
begin
at
the
very
beginning
and
do
leave
anything
out
however
trivial
sometimes
the
little
things
are
the
most
important
cheer
up
child
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
never
fear
sitting
on
the
bank
with
arnold
arm
round
her
ulyth
related
the
whole
of
her
story
mentioning
every
detail
she
could
remember
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
pour
it
out
into
sympathetic
ears
and
to
one
whose
judgment
was
more
likely
to
be
unbiased
than
that
of
anyone
connected
with
the
school
you
always
understand
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
kissed
the
hand
that
was
holding
hers
it
certainly
is
a
tangled
skein
to
unravel
but
as
it
happens
i
really
believe
i
can
throw
a
little
light
upon
the
matter
you
say
rona
told
you
that
somebody
came
into
her
bedroom
last
night
and
presumably
hid
the
pendant
in
her
blouse
pocket
yes
and
she
was
sure
that
somebody
was
myself
then
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
produce
the
real
culprit
if
we
can
find
her
just
now
i
was
wheeling
my
bicycle
up
tyn
y
bryn
hill
and
i
met
one
of
the
boys
from
jones
farm
he
stopped
me
and
handed
me
a
letter
girl
gave
it
to
me
five
minutes
ago
he
said
asked
me
if
i
was
going
to
the
village
and
if
i
post
it
for
her
so
i
promised
i
would
but
it
addressed
to
you
so
i
may
as
well
give
it
to
you
as
post
it
and
save
the
stamp
i
read
the
letter
and
it
puzzled
me
extremely
i
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
but
since
you
told
me
about
the
pendant
i
think
i
begin
to
understand
its
meaning
you
shall
see
it
for
yourself
arnold
spread
out
the
letter
on
her
knee
so
that
ulyth
might
read
it
it
was
written
on
village
in
a
childish
hand
with
no
stops
dear
mrs
arnold
this
comes
hoping
to
find
you
as
well
as
it
leves
me
at
present
i
am
in
dredful
trubble
and
i
can
not
stay
here
eny
longer
dear
mrs
arnold
after
what
cook
said
this
afternoon
i
am
sure
she
knows
all
and
i
daresunt
tell
miss
bowes
but
you

your
obedient
servant
susannah
maude
hawley
susannah
maude
exclaimed
ulyth
i
never
even
thought
of
her
is
it
possible
that
she
could
have
taken
the
pendant
from
the
letter
it
looks
rather
like
it
it
is
very
mysterious
and
i
can
not
understand
it
all
but
the
girl
appears
to
have
done
something
she
should
and
to
have
run
away
where
has
she
run
to
she
ca
have
gone
very
far
she
evidently
did
not
mean
me
to
receive
this
letter
until
morning
as
she
asked
idwal
jones
to
post
it
he
forestalled
her
intention
by
giving
it
to
me
now
it
a
most
fortunate
thing
as
we
may
be
able
to
overtake
her
she
is
probably
walking
to
llangarmon
and
can
not
have
gone
more
than
a
few
miles
by
this
time
i
shall
follow
her
at
once
on
my
machine
and
shall
most
likely
come
up
with
her
before
she
even
reaches
coed
glas
oh
let
me
go
with
you
pleaded
ulyth
starting
to
her
feet
and
seizing
the
bicycle
i
could
ride
on
the
carrier
i
often
done
it
before
oh
please
please
what
about
school
rules
miss
bowes
would
mind
if
you
took
me
just
this
once
well
i
suppose
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
to
bear
the
blame
if
we
get
into
trouble
about
it
oh
we
sha
we
must
find
susannah
maude
miss
bowes
would
want
us
to
stop
her
running
away
come
along
then
and
mind
you
balance
yourself
so
that
you
do
upset
us
trust
me
chuckled
ulyth
delightedly
back
along
the
road
by
which
she
had
come
sped
arnold
past
the
lane
that
led
to
her
own
house
and
away
in
the
direction
of
llangarmon
ulyth
managed
to
stick
on
without
impeding
her
progress
and
felt
a
delirious
joy
in
the
stolen
expedition
to
be
out
with
her
dear
arnold
on
such
an
exciting
adventure
was
an
hour
worth
remembering
she
could
not
often
get
the
guardian
of
the
fire
all
to
herself
in
this
glorious
fashion
she
would
be
the
envy
of
the
school
when
she
returned
susannah
maude
was
apparently
a
quick
walker
they
passed
through
the
hamlet
of
coed
glas
and
were
half
a
mile
beyond
before
they
caught
sight
of
the
odd
little
figure
trudging
on
ahead
they
overtook
her
exactly
on
the
bridge
that
crossed
the
llyn
mawr
stream
as
arnold
dismounted
and
called
her
by
name
susannah
maude
started
uttered
a
shriek
and
apparently
for
a
moment
contemplated
casting
herself
into
the
stream
below
the
guardian
of
the
fire
however
seized
her
firmly
by
the
arm
and
drawing
her
to
the
low
parapet
made
her
sit
down
now
tell
me
all
about
it
said
arnold
encouragingly
seating
herself
by
her
side
for
answer
susannah
maude
wept
unrestrainedly
the
hot
tears
dripping
down
her
hard
little
cheeks
into
her
rough
little
hands
arnold
waited
with
patience
till
the
storm
had
subsided
then
she
began
to
put
questions
did
you
take
the
young
lady
locket
susan
yes
i
did
but
i
did
want
to
i
would
if
i
had
been
so
scared
i
scared
to
death
now
as
she
find
me
you
need
be
afraid
of
miss
bowes
i
ai
leastways
not
so
bad
it
her
i
feared
of
whom
do
you
mean
child
her
my
mother
i
did
know
you
had
a
mother
i
thought
you
were
an
orphan
burst
out
ulyth
i
wish
i
was
no
my
father
and
mother
was
dead
they
was
both
serving
time
when
i
was
sent
to
the
home
when
mother
come
out
she
got
to
know
where
i
was
and
she
kept
an
eye
on
me
then
when
i
comes
here
to
a
situation
she
turns
up
one
day
at
the
back
door
and
says
she
wants
my
wages
i
give
her
all
i
got
but
that
did
satisfy
her
not
much
she
was
always
hanging
about
the
place
she
used
to
come
and
sell
sweets
and
cakes
to
the
young
ladies
was
that
your
mother
the
gipsy
woman
with
the
basket
exclaimed
ulyth
that
was
her
sure
enough
she
pestered
me
all
the
time
for
money
and
then
when
she
found
i
got
none
left
she
said
i
must
bring
her
something
instead
young
ladies
must
have
heaps
of
brooches
and
lockets
and
things
they
do
want
so
just
you
fetch
me
one
sez
she
if
you
do
i
catch
you
and
half
kill
you
oh
i
can
tell
you
i
was
scared
to
death
i
do
want
not
to
be
honest
but
she
half
killed
me
once
or
twice
before
when
i
was
a
kid
and
i
know
what
her
hand
like
when
she
uses
it
so
you
took
something
yes
i
waited
till
the
young
ladies
was
all
at
supper
then
i
got
down
one
of
their
coats
from
the
pegs
in
the
corridor
and
slipped
it
over
my
black
dress
and
apron
and
i
put
on
one
of
their
hats
i
thought
if
i
was
seen
upstairs
they
take
me
for
one
of
themselves
i
went
into
the
studio
and
there
right
opposite
on
a
little
table
was
that
kind
of
locket
thing
i
slipped
it
in
my
pocket
and
looked
round
the
room
if
there
was
another
just
like
it
on
the
bench
i
took
that
and
put
it
on
the
table
it
was
likely
perhaps
it
would
be
missed
as
quick
as
the
other
then
i
thought
i
better
be
going
i
was
just
walking
down
the
landing
when
i
hears
a
step
and
darts
into
one
of
the
bedrooms
they
catches
me
thinks
i
one
of
the
young
coats
and
hats
on
and
the
locket
in
my
hand
there
was
a
blouse
hanging
behind
the
door
with
a
little
pocket
just
handy
so
i
stuffed
the
locket
down
into
that
then
i
pulled
off
the
coat
and
threw
it
on
the
bed
and
flung
the
hat
out
of
the
window
i
thought
if
anyone
came
in
and
found
me
i
say
i
been
sent
to
refill
the
but
the
steps
went
on
and
i
rushed
out
and
downstairs
and
left
the
locket
where
it
was
i
was
so
scared
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
gracie
found
her
hat
in
the
garden
this
morning
gasped
ulyth
she
wondered
how
it
got
there
but
what
made
you
run
away
asked
arnold
returning
to
the
main
question
did
you
think
you
were
suspected
not
till
this
afternoon
then
the
servants
were
all
talking
in
the
kitchen
about
how
one
of
the
young
ladies
was
supposed
to
have
taken
what
they
called
a
or
something
and
cook
looked
straight
at
me
and
says
anything
missing
it
not
one
of
the
young
ladies
that
got
it
i
be
bound
and
i
turned
red
and
run
out
of
the
kitchen
my
mother
said
she
be
coming
round
this
evening
and
how
was
i
going
to
meet
her
with
no
locket
so
i
says
there
nothing
else
for
it
i
best
go
back
to
the
home
miss
bankes
she
was
good
to
me
and
mother
dares
show
her
face
there
so
i
wrote
a
letter
and
asked
jones
boy
to
post
it
i
did
think
you
get
it
till
very
fortunately
i
received
it
at
once
you
must
come
back
with
us
now
to
the
woodlands
susan
we
shall
all
have
to
walk
for
the
bicycle
wo
take
three
i
wheel
it
cried
ulyth
joyfully
she
half
kill
me
quavered
poor
susannah
maude
do
let
me
go
to
the
home
your
mother
shall
not
have
a
chance
of
coming
near
you
you
must
tell
all
this
to
miss
bowes
then
if
you
wish
you
may
be
sent
back
to
the
orphanage
no
successful
scouts
could
have
returned
to
camp
with
more
triumph
than
arnold
and
ulyth
as
very
late
and
decidedly
tired
they
arrived
at
the
woodlands
to
relate
their
surprising
story
miss
bowes
sent
at
once
for
rona
and
in
the
presence
of
the
principals
the
whole
matter
was
carefully
explained
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
even
poor
weeping
susannah
maude
i
am
very
glad
to
find
the
motive
for
which
rona
kept
silence
was
so
good
a
one
commented
miss
teddington
she
has
shown
her
loyalty
both
to
her
friend
and
to
the
school
dismissed
with
honour
from
the
study
ulyth
and
rona
were
hugging
each
other
in
the
privacy
of
the
boot
cupboard
can
you
ever
forgive
all
the
horrible
things
i
said
implored
rona
i
think
i
was
off
my
head
i
might
have
known
it
was
could
be
possible
you
are
you
the
one
girl
i
been
trying
to
copy
ever
since
i
came
here
you
quite
as
much
to
forgive
me
dear
and
i
beg
your
pardon
i
so
glad
it
all
straight
and
square
now
you
darling
i
do
mind
telling
you
it
was
tootie
who
gave
me
those
chocolates
did
you
buy
them
from
the
i
never
bought
anything
from
her
i
did
join
the
cake
club
then
how
did
she
get
hold
of
your
new
zealand
brooch
she
showed
it
to
me
why
i
swopped
that
brooch
with
tootie
for
a
penknife
ages
ago
always
swopping
our
things
in
iv
b
the
whole
business
seems
to
have
been
a
comedy
of
errors
said
ulyth
some
mischievous
puck
threw
dust
in
our
eyes
and
blinded
us
to
the
truth
after
all
it
was
the
juniors
that
suffered
most
for
miss
teddington
who
had
been
very
angry
at
the
whole
affair
turned
the
vials
of
her
wrath
upon
them
and
took
them
to
task
for
their
illicit
traffic
in
cakes
this
at
any
rate
she
was
determined
to
punish
and
not
a
solitary
sinner
was
allowed
to
escape
tootie
the
original
leader
in
rebellion
issued
from
her
interview
in
the
study
such
a
crushed
worm
as
to
stifle
any
lingering
seeds
of
mutiny
among
her
crestfallen
followers
what
to
become
of
susannah
maude
asked
everybody
and
miss
bowes
answered
the
question
i
am
taking
the
poor
child
back
to
the
orphanage
i
have
told
the
police
to
warn
her
disreputable
mother
from
this
neighbourhood
but
as
one
can
never
be
certain
when
she
might
turn
up
again
we
must
remove
susan
altogether
out
of
reach
of
her
evil
influence
a
party
of
girls
will
be
sent
from
the
home
very
soon
to
canada
and
we
shall
arrange
for
her
to
join
them
and
emigrate
to
a
new
country
where
she
will
be
placed
in
a
good
situation
on
a
farm
and
well
looked
after
she
is
not
really
a
dishonest
girl
and
has
a
very
grateful
and
affectionate
disposition
i
am
confident
that
she
will
do
us
credit
in
the
new
world
and
turn
out
a
useful
and
happy
citizen
why
yes
girls
if
you
like
to
make
her
a
little
present
before
she
sails
you
may
do
so
it
is
a
kind
thought
and
i
am
sure
she
will
appreciate
it
greatly
there
only
one
item
not
yet
wiped
out
on
the
slate
said
ulyth
to
lizzie
perhaps
i
ought
to
report
myself
for
walking
along
the
veranda
roof
i
feel
more
comfortable
go
ahead
then
teddie
at
the
confessional
now
it
never
been
exactly
forbidden
said
ulyth
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
after
she
had
stated
the
extent
of
her
enormity
to
miss
teddington
i
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
forbidding
you
to
climb
the
chimneys
it
was
a
dangerous
experiment
and
certainly
must
not
be
repeated
surprised
at
a
senior
no
as
you
have
told
me
yourself
i
will
not
enter
it
in
your
please
do
parade
the
roofs
in
future
now
you
may
go
got
off
even
easier
than
i
expected
rejoiced
ulyth
to
the
waiting
lizzie
teddie
bark
always
worse
than
her
bite
we
found
that
out
long
ago
agreed
lizzie
chapter
xix
a
surprise
the
that
had
gathered
round
the
mystery
of
the
lost
pendant
seemed
to
clear
the
air
and
sunshine
once
more
reigned
at
the
woodlands
the
juniors
were
on
their
very
best
behaviour
they
indulged
in
no
more
surreptitious
expeditions
and
abandoned
their
truculent
attitude
towards
the
elder
girls
who
while
careful
to
preserve
their
dignity
as
seniors
were
ready
to
wipe
off
old
scores
and
start
afresh
some
manoeuvres
in
connection
with
the
league
proved
a
bond
of
union
for
here
there
was
no
distinction
between
upper
and
lower
school
since
all
were
novices
to
the
new
work
and
had
to
learn
alike
none
indeed
had
any
time
at
present
to
get
into
mischief
as
the
end
of
the
term
with
its
prospects
of
examinations
drew
near
even
the
most
hardened
shirkers
were
obliged
to
put
their
shoulders
to
the
wheel
and
show
a
certain
amount
of
intimacy
with
their
textbooks
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
french
verbs
or
the
rules
of
latin
grammar
might
suffice
to
shuffle
through
the
ordinary
lessons
in
form
but
would
be
a
poor
crutch
when
confronted
with
a
pile
of
foolscap
paper
and
a
set
of
questions
and
likely
to
lead
to
disparaging
items
in
their
reports
in
every
department
therefore
there
was
a
of
effort
diaries
roughly
kept
were
neatly
copied
lists
of
birds
and
flowers
were
revised
the
geological
specimens
in
the
museum
were
rearranged
and
labelled
the
art
treasures
in
the
studio
touched
up
while
pianos
seemed
sounding
from
morning
to
night
the
school
was
on
its
mettle
to
appear
at
mark
miss
bowes
had
lately
instituted
an
old
girls
union
for
the
woodlands
the
first
gathering
of
which
was
to
be
held
in
conjunction
with
the
festivity
quite
a
number
of
past
pupils
had
accepted
the
invitation
and
people
of
influence
in
the
neighbourhood
were
also
expected
to
be
present
you
must
show
the
girls
what
you
can
do
said
miss
bowes
who
was
naturally
anxious
to
make
a
good
impression
on
the
visitors
i
want
them
to
think
the
standard
raised
not
lowered
some
of
our
ways
will
be
new
to
them
and
we
must
prove
that
the
changes
have
been
for
the
better
it
certainly
seemed
a
goal
to
work
for
even
the
most
irresponsible
junior
would
feel
humiliated
if
the
old
girls
were
to
consider
that
the
school
had
gone
down
and
all
took
a
just
pride
in
keeping
up
its
reputation
noëlle
derrington
and
phyllis
courtenay
have
accepted
it
was
stephanie
who
volunteered
the
information
they
have
both
been
presented
and
irene
vernon
has
promised
to
come
she
been
out
two
years
now
i
do
hope
those
wretched
kids
in
iv
b
will
behave
themselves
manners
have
gone
off
at
the
woodlands
in
my
opinion
even
if
the
work
better
when
my
sister
was
a
junior
she
says
they
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
ragging
the
mistresses
as
of
cheeking
the
seniors
o
tempora
o
mores
laughed
addie
when
you
an
old
lady
stephie
you
spend
all
your
time
lamenting
the
good
old
days
of
your
youth
and
telling
the
children
just
how
much
girls
used
to
be
when
you
were
at
school
i
sha
say
so
of
our
juniors
at
any
rate
snorted
stephanie
have
you
heard
yet
who
coming
from
the
neighbourhood
beth
enquired
and
arnold
of
course
and
colonel
and
hepworth
and
the
mowbrays
and
the
langtons
lord
and
lady
glyncraig
have
accepted
miss
harding
told
me
so
just
now
remarked
christine
oh
what
luck
stephanie
eyes
sparkled
it
will
just
give
the
finishing
touch
to
the
affair
did
you
say
that
lord
and
lady
glyncraig
are
coming
to
our
party
asked
rona
quickly
she
had
joined
the
group
in
company
with
winnie
and
hattie
so
i
understand
but
you
need
excite
yourself
it
is
likely
they
notice
juniors
though
they
probably
speak
to
a
few
seniors
whom
they
already
know
including
miss
stephanie
radford
of
course
scoffed
winnie
we
shall
expect
to
see
you
walking
arm
in
arm
with
them
round
the
grounds
and
hear
them
giving
you
a
most
pressing
invitation
to
plas
cafn
hattie
added
you
do
get
asked
there
as
often
as
one
would
suppose
considering
you
so
intimate
with
them
the
cheek
of
juniors
grows
beyond
all
bounds
declared
stephanie
stalking
away
i
afraid
i
know
what
irene
vernon
will
think
of
the
school
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
all
the
parents
of
the
girls
to
come
to
the
at
home
but
a
certain
proportion
had
promised
to
be
present
there
was
a
good
hotel
at
llangarmon
and
they
could
put
up
there
and
drive
over
for
the
occasion
the
neighbourhood
was
so
beautiful
that
several
would
take
the
opportunity
of
spending
a
few
days
in
sightseeing
i
news
to
tell
you
said
ulyth
to
rona
one
morning
her
face
radiant
as
she
showed
a
letter
who
do
you
think
are
coming
to
the
party
motherkins
and
oswald
ossie
just
be
home
in
time
so
jaunting
off
to
elwyn
bay
like
a
pair
of
honeymooners
motherkins
been
very
well
and
dad
says
the
sea
air
will
do
her
good
he
leave
business
himself
more
the
pity
wo
it
be
glorious
to
see
them
here
i
could
stand
on
my
head
i
so
glad
the
prospect
of
meeting
any
members
of
the
stanton
family
again
was
a
great
pleasure
to
rona
who
treasured
the
memory
of
the
christmas
holidays
as
her
happiest
experience
in
england
fowler
was
also
to
be
present
so
she
would
see
the
friend
who
had
been
kind
to
her
at
eastertide
as
well
i
glad
my
mother
coming
said
winnie
when
most
of
the
other
girls
have
somebody
its
so
horrid
to
be
left
out
poor
old
rona
i
wish
you
got
some
relations
of
your
own
who
could
be
here
it
hard
luck
a
shade
crossed
rona
face
she
hesitated
as
if
about
to
speak
then
apparently
changing
her
mind
kept
silence
what
an
idiotic
duffer
you
are
whispered
hattie
to
winnie
you
need
be
always
reminding
her
what
a
cuckoo
she
is
the
cuckoo
got
its
feathers
now
and
has
grown
a
very
handsome
bird
said
winnie
watching
rona
as
the
latter
walked
away
the
at
home
was
to
be
chiefly
a
gathering
for
the
old
girls
union
but
the
present
pupils
were
to
provide
a
short
programme
consisting
of
music
and
recitations
to
occupy
a
portion
of
the
afternoon
only
the
brightest
stars
were
selected
to
perform
the
school
got
to
show
off
laughed
gertie
it
to
try
and
take
the
shine
out
of
the
old
girls
miss
bowes
does
exactly
like
to
say
so
but
that
what
she
means
no
inferior
talent
permitted
agreed
addie
only
freshwater
oysters
may
wag
their
tails
metaphor
a
little
mixed
my
hearty
perhaps
you
show
us
an
oyster
tail
well
they
got
beards
at
any
rate
to
beard
the
lion
with
if
you
like
i
suppose
lord
glyncraig
will
be
the
lion
of
the
afternoon
we
shall
have
to
perform
before
him
oh
i
so
thankful
i
not
clever
enough
to
be
on
the
programme
after
careful
consideration
of
her
pupils
best
points
miss
ledbury
the
had
at
last
compiled
her
list
she
put
rona
down
for
a
song
rona
voice
had
developed
immensely
since
she
came
to
school
for
a
girl
of
her
age
it
had
a
wonderfully
rich
tone
and
wide
compass
miss
ledbury
thought
it
showed
promise
of
great
things
later
on
and
while
avoiding
overstraining
it
she
had
made
rona
practise
most
assiduously
there
was
rather
a
dearth
of
good
solo
voices
in
the
school
at
present
most
of
the
seniors
having
more
talent
for
the
piano
than
for
singing
otherwise
a
junior
might
not
have
obtained
a
place
on
the
coveted
programme
but
of
course
rona
not
exactly
a
junior
urged
ulyth
in
reply
to
several
jealous
comments
she
fifteen
now
although
she
only
in
iv
b
and
she
old
for
her
age
she
miles
above
the
kids
in
her
form
i
think
teddie
realizes
that
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
rona
skips
a
form
and
is
put
into
the
upper
school
next
term
she
manage
the
work
i
believe
it
been
rather
rough
on
her
to
stay
among
those
babes
well
i
say
miss
ledbury
might
have
chosen
a
soloist
from
v
b
returned
beth
icily
she
was
not
a
rona
enthusiast
who
stephie
playing
the
piano
and
gertie
reciting
merle
croaks
like
a
raven
you
and
chris
do
learn
singing
addie
no
ear
for
tune
and
the
rest
of
us
as
leddie
says
no
puff
i
glad
rona
can
do
something
well
for
the
school
she
been
here
three
terms
and
she
as
much
a
woodlander
now
as
anyone
else
rona
herself
seemed
to
regard
her
honour
with
dismay
the
easy
confidence
which
she
had
brought
from
new
zealand
had
quite
disappeared
thanks
to
incessant
snubbing
she
was
apt
now
to
veer
to
the
side
of
diffidence
do
you
think
i
break
down
she
asked
ulyth
nervously
not
a
bit
of
it
why
should
you
you
know
the
song
and
you
know
you
can
sing
it
just
let
yourself
go
and
do
think
of
the
audience
very
good
advice
no
doubt
but
a
trifle
difficult
to
follow
pouted
rona
do
think
of
the
audience
indeed
when
they
all
be
sitting
staring
at
me
am
i
to
shut
my
eyes
you
can
look
at
your
song
at
any
rate
and
fancy
you
alone
with
miss
ledbury
imagination
not
my
strong
point
i
wish
the
wretched
performance
was
over
and
done
with
there
were
great
preparations
on
the
morning
of
july
outside
the
gardeners
were
giving
a
last
roll
to
the
lawns
and
a
last
sweep
to
the
paths
in
the
kitchen
the
cook
was
setting
out
rows
of
small
cakes
and
the
in
the
pantry
was
counting
cups
and
spoons
and
polishing
the
best
silver
urn
in
the
school
department
finishing
touches
were
put
everywhere
great
bowls
of
roses
were
placed
in
the
and
jars
of
tall
lilies
in
the
hall
the
studio
arranged
yesterday
with
its
exhibits
of
arts
and
handicrafts
was
further
decorated
with
picturesque
boughs
of
larch
and
spikes
of
foxgloves
two
curators
were
told
off
to
explain
the
museum
to
visitors
and
selected
to
help
to
hand
round
cups
and
cakes
a
band
of
special
scouts
picked
raspberries
and
arranged
them
on
little
green
plates
chairs
were
placed
in
the
and
under
the
trees
in
view
of
the
lawn
the
rustic
seats
were
carefully
dusted
in
the
glade
by
the
stream
by
three
the
school
was
in
a
flutter
of
expectation
do
i
look
decent
asked
rona
anxiously
taking
a
last
nervous
peep
at
her
toilet
in
the
wardrobe
mirror
decent
exclaimed
ulyth
you
for
all
the
world
like
a
sir
joshua
reynolds
portrait
i
like
to
frame
you
just
as
you
are
and
hang
you
on
the
wall
you
would
feel
ashamed
of
me
if
if
you
happened
to
be
my
relation
i
improved
a
little
since
i
came
here
have
i
i
was
a
wild
sort
of
when
i
arrived
i
know
the
is
a
princess
said
her
exultantly
ulyth
thought
rona
had
never
looked
so
sweet
the
pretty
white
dress
trimmed
with
pale
blue
edgings
suited
her
exactly
and
set
off
her
lovely
colouring
and
rich
hair
her
eyes
shone
like
diamonds
and
the
mingled
excitement
and
shyness
in
her
face
gave
a
peculiar
charm
to
her
expression
she
far
and
away
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
school
reflected
ulyth
if
there
were
a
beauty
prize
she
win
it
everybody
was
waiting
in
the
garden
when
the
guests
arrived
the
scene
soon
became
gay
and
animated
there
were
delighted
welcomings
of
parents
enthusiastic
meetings
between
old
school
chums
and
a
hearty
greeting
to
all
visitors
stanton
and
oswald
had
driven
in
a
taxi
from
elwyn
bay
and
were
received
with
rapture
by
ulyth
motherkins
oh
how
lovely
to
see
you

i
must
have
you
all
to
myself
for
just
a
minute
or
two
before
i
share
you
with
anybody
even
rona
is
that
rona
over
there
asked
oswald
gazing
half
amazed
at
the
friend
who
seemed
to
have
added
a
new
dignity
to
her
manner
as
well
as
inches
to
her
stature
since
yes
go
and
fetch
her
to
speak
to
motherkins
i
hardly
like
to
she
looks
so
stately
and
now
what
nonsense
ossie
you
ca
be
shy
all
of
a
sudden
what
come
over
you
you
silly
boy
there
i
beckon
to
rona
ah

the
concert
because

one
of
the
performers
and
will
have
to
be
in
the
front
row
the
ceremonies
were
to
take
place
in
the
hall
after
which
tea
would
be
served
to
the
company
lord
glyncraig
is
to
act
as
chairman
whispered
addie
stephie
is
so
fearfully
excited
she
means
to
go
and
speak
to
him
and
lady
glyncraig
afterwards
i
hope
to

so
woefully
humiliated
she
wants
us
all
to
see
that
she
knows
them
she
been
just
living
for
this
afternoon
i
believe
rona
her
hands
tightly
clasped
watched
the
tall
figure
mount
the
platform
lord
glyncraig
with
his
features
hair
and
commanding
air
looked
a
born
leader
of
men
and
well
fitted
to
take
his
share
in
swaying
a
nation
destiny
she
could
picture
him
a
power
in
parliament
it
was
good
of
him
to
come
this
afternoon
to
speak
at
a
girls
school
lady
glyncraig
handsome
and
aristocratic
sat
in
the
post
of
honour
next
to
miss
bowes
rona
noticed
her
gracious
reception
of
the
beautiful
bouquet
handed
to
her
by
catherine
and
sighed
as
she
looked
there
were
no
prizes
at
the
woodlands
this
year
for
the
girls
had
asked
to
devote
the
money
to
the
orphanage
but
the
examination
lists
and
the
annual
report
were
read
and
some
pleasant
comments
made
upon
the
scope
of
the
old
girls
union
lord
glyncraig
had
a
happy
gift
of
speech
and
could
adapt
his
remarks
to
the
occasion
everybody
felt
that
he
had
said
exactly
the
right
things
and
principals
mistresses
parents
and
pupils
past
or
present
were
wreathed
in
smiles
these
opening
ceremonies
did
not
take
very
long
and
the
concert
followed
immediately
marjorie
prelude
evie
nocturne
stephanie
mazurka
and
recitation
all
went
off
without
a
hitch
and
received
their
due
reward
of
appreciation
it
was
now
rona
turn
for
a
moment
she
grew
pale
as
she
mounted
the
platform
then
the
coral
flushed
back
into
her
cheeks
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
audience
miss
ledbury
was
already
playing
the
opening
bars
come
out
come
out
my
dearest
dear
come
out
and
greet
the
sun
mellow
and
tuneful
as
a
blackbird
rona
clear
rich
young
voice
rang
out
so
fresh
so
joyous
so
natural
so
full
of
the
very
spirit
of
maying
and
the
glory
of
summer
return
that
the
visitors
listened
as
one
hearkens
to
the
notes
of
a
bird
that
is
pouring
forth
its
heart
from
a
in
the
orchard
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
applause
guests
and
girls
clapped
their
hardest
rona
all
unwilling
was
recalled
and
made
to
sing
an
encore
and
as
she
left
the
platform
everybody
felt
that
she
had
scored
the
triumph
of
the
occasion
glad
the
juniors
were
excluded
it
a
for
steph
whispered
addie
trust
miss
ledbury
not
to
leave
out
rona
she
be
our
champion
soloist
now
returned
christine
the
rest
of
the
little
programme
was
soon
finished
and
the
audience
adjourned
to
the
garden
for
tea
stephanie
with
a
tray
of
raspberries
and
cream
came
smilingly
up
to
lord
and
lady
glyncraig
and
introducing
herself
reminded
them
of
the
delightful
visit
she
had
paid
to
plas
cafn
if
they
had
really
forgotten
her
they
had
the
good
manners
not
to
reveal
the
fact
and
spoke
to
her
kindly
and
pleasantly
by
the
by
said
lord
glyncraig
where
is
your
schoolfellow
who
sang
so
well
just
now
i
do
see
her
on
the
lawn
rona
mitchell
i
suppose
she
is
somewhere
about
replied
stephanie
casually
do
you
happen
to
know
if
she
comes
from
new
zealand
yes
she
does
i
wonder
if
you
could
find
her
and
bring
her
here
i
should
like
very
much
to
speak
to
her
stephanie
could
not
refuse
though
her
errand
was
uncongenial
she
could
not
imagine
why
an
minister
should
concern
himself
with
a
girl
from
the
backwoods
lord
glyncraig
wants
you
so
hurry
up
and
do
keep
him
waiting
was
the
message
she
delivered
not
too
politely
rona
blushed
furiously
she
appeared
on
the
very
point
of
declining
to
obey
the
summons
go
dear
said
stanton
quietly
perhaps
he
wishes
to
congratulate
you
on
the
success
of
your
song
yes
rona
go
it
would
be
most
ungracious
to
refuse
with
a
face
in
which
shyness
nervousness
pride
and
defiance
strove
for
the
mastery
rona
approached
lord
glyncraig
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
wo
you
bury
the
hatchet
and
let
us
be
friends
at
last
rona
he
said
i
proud
of
my
granddaughter
you
a
true
chip
of
the
old
block
a
mitchell
to
your
and
in
a
lower
tone
with
your
mother
voice
thrown
into
the
bargain
blood
is
thicker
than
water
child
and
it
time
now
for
bygones
to
become
bygones
i
shall
write
to
your
father
and
set
things
straight
how
is
it
that
you
actually
been
a
whole
year
at
the
woodlands
and
never
let
anybody
have
the
least
hint
that
lord
glyncraig
is
your
grandfather
do
you
know
what
an
enormous
difference
it
would
have
made
to
your
position
in
the
school
stephie
is
quite
hysterical
about
it
why
was
it
such
a
dead
secret
asked
ulyth
of
her
as
they
took
off
their
party
dresses
when
the
guests
had
gone
it
rather
a
long
story
replied
rona
sitting
down
on
her
bed
in
the
first
place
i
dare
say
you
guessed
that
dad
was
the
prodigal
of
the
family
he
never
did
anything
very
bad
poor
dear
but
he
was
packed
off
to
the
colonies
in
disgrace
and
told
that
he
might
stay
there
at
melbourne
he
met
a
lovely
opera
singer
who
was
on
tour
in
australia
and
married
her
that
made
my
grandfather
more
angry
than
anything
else
he
had
done
i
not
ashamed
of
my
mother
she
was
very
clever
and
sang
like
an
angel
i
told
though
i
ca
remember
her
when
she
died
dad
went
to
new
zealand
and
started
farming
barker
was
hardly
an
ideal
person
to
bring
me
up
but
she
was
the
only
woman
we
could
get
to
stop
in
such
an
place
i
must
have
been
an
awful
specimen
of
a
child
i
do
like
to
remember
what
things
i
did
then
when
i
was
about
ten
father
went
away
for
a
few
weeks
to
the
north
island
and
while
he
was
gone
barker
went
off
in
the
gig
to
have
a
day
shopping
at
the
nearest
store
she
left
me
alone
in
the
house
i
was
frightened
for
i
was
quite
accustomed
to
it
no
one
but
a
chance
neighbour
ever
came
near
yet
that
day
was
just
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
early
in
the
afternoon
a
grand
travelling
motor
drove
up
and
a
lady
and
gentleman
knocked
at
the
door
and
enquired
for
dad
i
was
a
little
wild
rough
thing
then
and
i
was
simply
scared
to
death
at
the
sight
of
strangers
i
told
them
dad
was
away
then
they
asked
if
they
might
come
in
and
the
gentleman
said
he
was
my
grandfather
and
the
lady
was
his
new
wife
so
that
she
was
my
now
barker
had
always
rubbed
it
in
to
me
that
if
i
was
left
alone
i
must
on
no
account
admit
strangers
that
was
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
i
was
in
a
panic
and
i
slammed
the
door
on
them
and
bolted
it
and
then
ran
to
the
window
and
pulled
faces
hoping
to
make
them
go
away
they
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
quite
aghast
trying
to
get
me
to
listen
to
reason
through
the
window
but
i
only
grew
more
and
more
frightened
and
called
them
all
the
ugly
names
i
could
no
use
attempting
to
tame
such
a
young
savage
said
the
lady
at
last
then
they
got
into
their
car
again
and
drove
away
by
the
time
barker
arrived
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
so
i
said
nothing
about
my
adventure
and
i
never
dared
to
tell
dad
a
word
of
it
i
suppose
his
father
had
come
to
hunt
him
up
but
he
was
evidently
discouraged
at
the
reception
he
had
received
at
the
farm
and
went
back
to
england
without
making
another
attempt
at
a
meeting
i
do
believe
he
and
dad
ever
wrote
to
each
other
from
year
end
to
year
end
i
tried
to
forget
this
but
it
stuck
in
my
memory
all
the
same
time
went
by
my
friendship
with
you
began
and
it
was
decided
that
i
should
be
sent
to
the
woodlands
i
knew
my
grandfather
lived
at
plas
cafn
for
dad
had
told
me
about
his
old
home
but
i
did
not
know
it
was
so
near
to
the
school
you
ask
why
i
did
not
tell
the
girls
that
i
was
related
to
lord
glyncraig
there
were
several
reasons
in
the
first
place
i
was
really
very
much
ashamed
of
my
behaviour
the
day
he
had
come
to
our
farm
i
thought
he
had
cast
us
off
completely
and
would
not
be
at
all
pleased
to
own
me
as
granddaughter
i
would
not
confess
it
to
any
of
you
but
i
felt
so
rough
and
uncouth
when
i
compared
myself
with
other
girls
that
i
did
not
want
lord
glyncraig
to
see
me
or
to
know
that
i
was
in
the
neighbourhood
perhaps
some
day
so
i
thought
i
might
grow
more
like
you
if
i
tried
hard
and
then
it
would
be
time
enough
to
tell
him
of
my
whereabouts
then
because
he
had
disowned
us
i
felt
much
too
proud
to
boast
about
the
relationship
at
school
if
you
could
not
like
me
for
myself
i
would
make
a
bid
for
popularity
on
the
cheap
basis
of
being
his
granddaughter
i
a
democrat
at
heart
and
i
think
people
ought
to
be
valued
on
their
own
merits
entirely
i
rather
be
an
outsider
than
shine
with
a
reflected
glory
you
be
popular
now
said
ulyth
are
you
to
spend
the
holidays
at
plas
cafn
yes
miss
bowes
says
i
must
though
i
far
rather
have
accepted
your
invitation
lady
glyncraig
was
very
kind
and
sweet
she
kissed
me
and
said
she
hoped
so
much
that
we
should
be
friends
they
have
promised
to
ask
dad
to
come
over
for
next
christmas
and
have
a
big
family
reunion
you
wo
let
them
take
you
away
from
the
woodlands
we
do
want
to
lose
you
dear
you
must
stay
here
now
for
the
sake
of
the
school
for
my
own
sake
cried
rona
flinging
her
arms
round
her
friend
ulyth
i
owe
everything
in
the
world
to
you
i
understand
now
how
good
it
was
of
you
to
take
me
into
your
room
and
teach
me
i
was
a
veritable
cuckoo
in
your
nest
then
a
horrid
tiresome
trespassing
bird
a
savage
a
bear
cub
a
gawk
as
the
girls
called
me
entirely
thanks
to
you
if
at
last
i
the
sweetest
prairie
rose
that
ever
came
out
of
the
wilderness
finished
ulyth
warmly
