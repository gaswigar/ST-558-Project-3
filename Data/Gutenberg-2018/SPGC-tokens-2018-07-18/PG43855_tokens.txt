to

respectfully

judge
then
how
much
i
must

been
gratified
by
an
incident
i
am
going
to
relate
to
you
i
stopped
my
horse
lately
where
a
great
number
of
people
were
collected
at
an
auction
of
merchants
goods
the
hour
of
the
sale
not
being
come
they
were
conversing
on
the
badness
of
the
times
and
one
of
the
company
called
to
a
plain
clean
old
man
with
white
locks
father
abraham
what
think
you
of
the
times
will
not
those
heavy
taxes
quite
ruin
the
country
how
shall
we
be
ever
able
to
pay
them
what
would
you
advise
us
to
father
abraham
stood
up
and
replied
you
would
have
my
advice
i
will
give
it
you
in
short
for
a
word
to
the
wise
is
enough
as
poor
richard
says
they
joined
in
desiring
him
to
speak
his
mind
and
gathering
round
him
he
proceeded
as
follows
says
he
taxes
are
indeed
very
heavy
and
if
those
laid
on
by
the
government
were
the
only
ones
we
had
to
pay
we
might
more
easily
discharge
them
but
we
have
many
others
and
much
more
grievous
to
some
of
us
we
are
taxed
twice
as
much
by
our
idleness
three
times
as
much
by
our
pride
and
four
times
as
much
by
our
folly
and
from
these
taxes
the
commissioners
can
not
ease
or
deliver
us
by
allowing
an
abatement
however
let
us
hearken
to
good
advice
and
something
may
be
done
for
us
god
helps
them
that
help
themselves
as
poor
richard
says
i
would
be
thought
a
hard
government
that
should
tax
its
people
part
of
their
time
to
be
employed
in
its
service
but
idleness
taxes
many
of
us
much
more
sloth
by
bringing
on
diseases
absolutely
shortens
life

sloth
like
rust
consumes
faster
than
labour
wears
while
the
used
key
is
always
bright
as
poor
richard
but
dost
thou
love
life
then
do
not
squander
time
for
that
is
the
stuff
life
is
made
of
as
poor
richard
how
much
more
than
is
necessary
do
we
spend
in
sleep
forgetting
that
the
sleeping
fox
catches
no
poultry
and
that
there
will
be
sleeping
enough
in
the
grave
as
poor
richard
says
illustration
if
time
be
of
all
things
the
most
precious
wasting
time
must
be
as
poor
richard
says
the
greatest
prodigality
since
as
he
elsewhere
tells
us
lost
time
is
never
found
again
and
what
we
call
time
enough
always
proves
little
enough
let
us
then
up
and
be
doing
and
doing
to
the
purpose
so
by
diligence
shall
we
do
more
with
less
perplexity
sloth
makes
all
things
difficult
but
industry
all
easy
and
he
that
riseth
late
must
trot
all
day
and
shall
scarce
overtake
his
business
at
night
while
laziness
travels
so
slowly
that
poverty
soon
overtakes
him
drive
thy
business
let
not
that
drive
thee
and
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
makes
a
man
healthy
wealthy
and
wise
as
poor
richard
says
illustration
the
sun
shone
yesterday
and
i
would
not
work
it
rains
and
i
can
not
work
what
signifies
wishing
and
hoping
for
better
times
we
may
make
these
times
better
if
we
bestir
ourselves
industry
need
not
wish
and
he
that
lives
upon
hope
will
die
fasting
there
are
no
gains
without
pains
then
help
hands
for
i
have
no
lands
or
if
i
have
they
are
smartly
taxed
he
that
hath
a
trade
hath
an
estate
and
he
that
hath
a
calling
hath
an
office
of
profit
and
honour
as
poor
richard
says
but
then
the
trade
must
be
worked
at
and
the
calling
well
followed
or
neither
the
estate
nor
the
office
will
enable
us
to
pay
our
if
we
are
industrious
we
shall
never
starve
for
at
the
working
man
house
hunger
looks
in
but
dares
not
enter
nor
will
the
bailiff
or
the
constable
enter
for
industry
pays
debts
while
despair
increaseth
them
what
though
you
have
found
no
treasure
nor
has
any
rich
relation
left
you
a
legacy
diligence
is
the
mother
of
good
luck
and
god
gives
all
things
to
industry
then
plow
deep
while
sluggards
sleep
and
you
shall
have
corn
to
sell
and
to
keep
work
while
it
is
called
for
you
know
not
how
much
you
may
be
hindered
one
is
worth
two
as
poor
richard
says
and
farther
never
leave
that
till
which
you
can
do
if
you
were
a
servant
would
you
not
be
ashamed
that
a
good
master
should
catch
you
idle
are
you
then
your
own
master
be
ashamed
to
catch
yourself
idle
when
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
for
yourself
your
family
your
country
and
your
king
handle
your
tools
without
mittens
remember
that
the
cat
in
gloves
catches
no
mice
as
poor
richard
says
it
is
true
there
is
much
to
be
done
and
perhaps
you
are
but
stick
to
it
steadily
and
you
will
see
great
effects
for
constant
dropping
wears
away
stones
and
by
diligence
and
patience
the
mouse
ate
in
two
the
cable
and
little
strokes
fell
great
oaks
illustration
i
hear
some
of
you
say
must
a
man
afford
himself
no
leisure
i
will
tell
thee
my
friend
what
poor
richard
says
employ
thy
time
well
if
thou
meanest
to
gain
leisure
and
since
thou
art
not
sure
of
a
minute
throw
not
away
an
hour
leisure
is
time
for
doing
something
useful
this
leisure
the
diligent
man
will
obtain
but
the
lazy
man
never
for
a
life
of
leisure
and
a
life
of
laziness
are
two
things
many
without
labour
would
live
by
their
wits
only
but
they
break
for
want
of
stock
whereas
industry
gives
comfort
and
plenty
and
respect
fly
pleasures
and
they
will
follow
you
the
diligent
spinner
has
a
large
shift
and
now
i
have
a
sheep
and
a
cow
every
body
bids
me
ii
with
our
industry
we
must
likewise
be
steady
settled
and
careful
and
oversee
our
own
affairs
with
our
own
eyes
and
not
trust
too
much
to
others
for
as
poor
richard
says
i
never
saw
an
tree
nor
yet
an
family
that
throve
so
well
as
those
that
settled
be
and
again
three
removes
are
as
bad
as
a
fire
and
again
keep
thy
shop
and
thy
shop
will
keep
thee
and
again
if
you
would
have
your
business
done
go
if
not
send
and
again
he
that
by
the
plow
would
thrive
himself
must
either
hold
or
drive
again
the
eye
of
the
master
will
do
more
work
than
both
his
hands
and
again
want
of
care
does
us
more
damage
than
want
of
knowledge
and
again
not
to
oversee
workmen
is
to
leave
them
your
purse
open

too
much
to
others
care
is
the
ruin
of
many
for
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
men
are
saved
not
by
faith
but
by
the
want
of
it
but
a
man
own
care
is
profitable
for
if
you
would
have
a
faithful
servant
and
one
that
you
like
serve
yourself
a
little
neglect
may
breed
great
mischief
for
want
of
a
nail
the
shoe
was
lost
for
want
of
a
shoe
the
horse
was
lost
and
for
want
of
a
horse
the
rider
was
lost
being
overtaken
and
slain
by
the

all
for
want
of
a
little
care
about
a
nail
iii
much
for
industry
my
friends
and
attention
to
one
own
business
but
to
these
we
must
add
frugality
if
we
would
make
our
industry
more
certainly
successful
a
man
may
if
he
knows
not
how
to
save
as
he
gets
keep
his

all
his
life

and

a

and
many

women

forsook
spinning
and
knitting
and
men

would

then
with
your
expensive
follies
and
you
will
not
then
have
so
much
cause
to
complain
of
hard
times
heavy
taxes
and
chargeable
families
for
women
and
wine
game
and
deceit
make
the
wealth
small
and
the
want
great
and
farther
what
maintains
one
vice
would
bring
up
two
children
you
may
think
perhaps
that
a
little
tea
or
a
little
punch
now
and
then
diet
a
little
more
costly
clothes
a
little
finer
and
a
little
entertainment
now
and
then
can
be
no
great
matter
but
remember
many
a
little
makes
a
mickle
beware
of
little
expences
a
small
leak
will
sink
a
great
ship
as
poor
richard
says
and
again
who
dainties
love
shall
beggars
prove
and
moreover
fools
make
feasts
and
wise
men
eat
them
here
you
are
all
got
together
to
this
sale
of
fineries
and
you
call
them
goods
but
if
you
do
not
take
care
they
will
prove
evils
to
some
of
you
you
expect
they
will
be
sold
cheap
and
perhaps
they
may
for
less
than
they
cost
but
if
you
have
no
occasion
for
them
they
must
be
dear
to
you
remember
what
poor
richard
says
buy
what
thou
hast
no
need
of
and
ere
long
thou
shalt
sell
thy
necessaries
and
again
at
a
great
pennyworth
pause
a
while
he
means
that
perhaps
the
cheapness
is
apparent
only
and
not
real
or
the
bargain
by
straitening
thee
in
thy
business
may
do
thee
more
harm
than
good
for
in
another
place
he
says
many
have
been
ruined
by
buying
good
pennyworths
again
it
is
foolish
to
lay
out
money
in
a
purchase
of
repentance
and
yet
this
folly
is
practised
every
day
at
auctions
for
want
of
minding
the
almanack
many
a
one
for
the
sake
of
finery
on
the
back
have
gone
with
a
hungry
belly
and
half
starved
their
families
silks
and
satins
scarlet
and
velvets
put
out
the
kitchen
fire
as
poor
richard
says
these
are
not
the
necessaries
of
life
they
can
scarcely
be
called
the
conveniences
and
yet
only
because
they
look
pretty
how
many
want
to
have
them
by
these
and
other
extravagancies
the
genteel
are
reduced
to
poverty
and
forced
to
borrow
of
those
whom
they
formerly
despised
but
who
through
industry
and
frugality
have
maintained
their
standing
in
which
case
it
appears
plainly
that
a
ploughman
on
his
legs
is
higher
than
a
gentleman
on
his
knees
as
poor
richard
says
perhaps
they
have
had
a
small
estate
left
them
which
they
knew
not
the
getting
of
they
think
it
is
day
and
will
never
be
night
that
a
little
to
be
spent
out
of
so
much
is
not
worth
minding
but
always
taking
out
of
the
and
never
putting
in
soon
comes
to
the
bottom
as
poor
richard
says
and
then
when
the
well
is
dry
they
know
the
worth
of
water
but
this
they
might
have
known
before
if
they
had
taken
his
advice
if
you
would
know
the
value
of
money
go
and
try
to
borrow
some
for
he
that
goes
a
borrowing
goes
a
sorrowing
as
poor
richard
says
and
indeed
so
does
he
that
lends
to
such
people
when
he
goes
to
get
it
in
again
poor
dick
farther
advises
and
says
fond
pride
of
dress
is
sure
a
very
curse
ere
fancy
you
consult
consult

again
pride
is
as
loud
a
beggar
as
want
and
a
great
deal
more
saucy
when
you
have
bought
one
fine
thing
you
must
buy
ten
more
that
your
appearance
may
be
all
of
a
piece
but
poor
dick
says
it
is
easier
to
suppress
the
first
desire
than
to
satisfy
all
that
follow
it
and
it
is
as
truly
folly
for
the
poor
to
ape
the
rich
as
for
the
frog
to
swell
in
order
to
equal
the
ox
vessels
large
may
venture
more
but
little
boats
should
keep
near
shore
it
is
however
a
folly
soon
punished
for
as
poor
richard
says
pride
that
dines
on
vanity
sups
on
contempt
pride
breakfasted
with
plenty
dined
with
poverty
and
supped
with
infamy
and
after
all
of
what
use
is
this
pride
of
appearance
for
which
so
much
is
risked
so
much
is
suffered
it
can
not
promote
health
nor
ease
pain
it
makes
no
increase
of
merit
in
the
person
it
creates
envy
it
hastens
misfortune
what
madness
it
must
be
to
run
in
debt
for
these
superfluities
we
are
offered
by
the
terms
of
this
sale
six
months
credit
and
that
perhaps
has
induced
some
of
us
to
attend
it
because
we
can
not
spare
the
ready
money
and
hope
now
to
be
fine
without
it
but
ah
think
what
you
do
when
you
run
in
debt
you
give
to
another
power
over
your
liberty
if
you
can
not
pay
at
the
time
you
will
be
ashamed
to
see
your
creditor
you
will
be
in
fear
when
you
speak
to
him
you
will
make
poor
pitiful
sneaking
excuses
and
by
degrees
come
to
lose
your
veracity
and
sink
into
base
downright
lying
for
the
second
vice
is
lying
the
first
is
running
in
debt
as
poor
richard
says
and
again
to
the
same
purpose
lying
rides
upon
debt
back
whereas
a
englishman
ought
not
to
be
ashamed
nor
afraid
to
see
or
speak
to
any
man
living
but
poverty
often
deprives
a
man
of
all
spirit
and
virtue
it
is
hard
for
an
empty
bag
to
stand
upright
what
would
you
think
of
that
prince
or
of
that
government
who
should
issue
an
edict
forbidding
you
to
dress
like
a
gentleman
or
gentlewoman
on
pain
of
imprisonment
or
servitude
would
you
not
say
that
you
were
free
have
a
right
to
dress
as
you
please
and
that
such
an
edict
would
be
a
breach
of
your
privileges
and
such
a
government
tyrannical
and
yet
you
are
about
to
put
yourself
under
that
tyranny
when
you
run
in
debt
for
such
dress
your
creditor
has
authority
at
his
pleasure
to
deprive
you
of
your
liberty
by
confining
you
in
gaol
for
life
or
by
selling
you
for
a
servant
if
you
should
not
be
able
to
pay
him
when
you
have
got
your
bargain
you
may
perhaps
think
little
of
payment
but
as
poor
richard
says
creditors
have
better
memories
than
debtors
creditors
are
a
superstitious
sect
great
observers
of
set
days
and
times
the
day
comes
round
before
you
are
aware
and
the
demand
is
made
before
you
are
prepared
to
satisfy
it
or
if
you
bear
your
debt
in
mind
the
term
which
at
first
seemed
so
long
will
as
it
lessens
appear
extremely
short
time
will
seem
to
have
added
wings
to
his
heels
as
well
as
his
shoulders
those
have
a
short
lent
who
owe
money
to
be
paid
at
easter
at
present
perhaps
you
may
think
yourselves
in
thriving
circumstances
and
that
you
can
bear
a
little
extravagance
without
injury
but
for
age
and
want
save
while
you
may
no
morning
sun
lasts
a
whole
day
gain
may
be
temporary
and
uncertain
but
ever
while
you
live
expense
is
constant
and
certain
and
it
is
easier
to
build
two
chimneys
than
to
keep
one
in
fuel
as
poor
richard
says
so
rather
go
to
bed
than
rise
in
debt
get
what
you
can
and
what
you
get
hold
is
the
stone
that
will
turn
all
your
lead
into
gold
and
when
you
have
got
the
philosopher
stone
sure
you
will
no
longer
complain
of
bad
times
or
the
difficulty
of
paying
taxes
iv
doctrine
my
friends
is
reason
and
wisdom
but
after
all
do
not
depend
too
much
upon
your
own
industry
and
frugality
and
prudence
though
excellent
things
for
they
may
all
be
blasted
without
the
blessing
of
heaven
and
therefore
ask
that
blessing
humbly
and
be
not
uncharitable
to
those
that
at
present
seem
to
want
it
but
comfort
and
help
them
remember
job
suffered
and
was
afterwards
prosperous
illustration
now
to
conclude
experience
keeps
a
dear
school
but
fools
will
learn
in
no
other
as
poor
richard
says
and
scarce
in
that
for
it
is
true
we
may
give
advice
but
we
can
not
give
conduct
however
remember
this
they
that
will
not
be
counselled
can
not
be
helped
and
farther
that
if
you
will
not
hear
reason
she
will
surely
rap
your
knuckles
as
poor
richard
says
thus
the
old
gentleman
ended
his
harangue
the
people
heard
it
and
approved
the
doctrine
and
immediately
practised
the
contrary
just
as
if
it
had
been
a
common
sermon
for
the
auction
opened
and
they
began
to
buy
i
found
the
good
man
had
thoroughly
studied
my
almanacks
and
digested
all
i
had
dropt
on
those
topics
during
the
course
of
years
the
frequent
mention
he
made
of
me
must
have
tired
any
one
else
but
my
vanity
was
wonderfully
delighted
with
it
though
i
was
conscious
that
not
a
tenth
part
of
the
wisdom
was
my
own
which
he
ascribed
to
me
but
rather
the
gleanings
that
i
had
made
of
the
sense
of
all
ages
and
nations
however
i
resolved
to
be
the
better
for
the
echo
of
it
and
though
i
had
at
first
determined
to
buy
stuff
for
a
new
coat
i
went
away
resolved
to
wear
my
old
one
a
little
longer
reader
if
thou
wilt
do
the
same
thy
profit
will
be
as
great
as
i
am
as
ever
thine
to
serve
thee
