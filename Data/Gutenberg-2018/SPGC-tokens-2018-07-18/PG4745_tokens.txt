chapter
i
summer
lightning
it
was
ricardo
habit
as
soon
as
the
second
week
of
august
came
round
to
travel
to
in
savoy
where
for
five
or
six
weeks
he
lived
pleasantly
he
pretended
to
take
the
waters
in
the
morning
he
went
for
a
ride
in
his
in
the
afternoon
he
dined
at
the
cercle
in
the
evening
and
spent
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
in
the
at
the
villa
des
fleurs
an
enviable
smooth
life
without
a
doubt
and
it
is
certain
that
his
acquaintances
envied
him
at
the
same
time
however
they
laughed
at
him
and
alas
with
some
justice
for
he
was
an
exaggerated
person
he
was
to
be
construed
in
the
comparative
everything
in
his
life
was
a
trifle
overdone
from
the
fastidious
arrangement
of
his
neckties
to
the
feminine
nicety
of
his
little
in
age
ricardo
was
approaching
the
fifties
in
condition
he
was
a
widower
a
state
greatly
to
his
liking
for
he
avoided
at
once
the
irksomeness
of
marriage
and
the
reproaches
justly
levelled
at
the
bachelor
finally
he
was
rich
having
amassed
a
fortune
in
mincing
lane
which
he
had
invested
in
profitable
securities
ten
years
of
ease
however
had
not
altogether
obliterated
in
him
the
business
look
though
he
lounged
from
january
to
december
he
lounged
with
the
air
of
a
financier
taking
a
holiday
and
when
he
visited
as
he
frequently
did
the
studio
of
a
painter
a
stranger
would
have
hesitated
to
decide
whether
he
had
been
drawn
thither
by
a
love
of
art
or
by
the
possibility
of
an
investment
his
acquaintances
have
been
mentioned
and
the
word
is
suitable
for
while
he
mingled
in
many
circles
he
stood
aloof
from
all
he
affected
the
company
of
artists
by
whom
he
was
regarded
as
one
ambitious
to
become
a
connoisseur
and
amongst
the
younger
business
men
who
had
never
dealt
with
him
he
earned
the
disrespect
reserved
for
the
dilettante
if
he
had
a
grief
it
was
that
he
had
discovered
no
great
man
who
in
return
for
practical
favours
would
engrave
his
memory
in
brass
he
was
a
maecenas
without
a
horace
an
earl
of
southampton
without
a
shakespeare
in
a
word
in
the
season
was
the
very
place
for
him
and
never
for
a
moment
did
it
occur
to
him
that
he
was
here
to
be
dipped
in
agitations
and
hurried
from
excitement
to
excitement
the
beauty
of
the
little
town
the
crowd
of
and
agreeable
people
the
life
of
the
place
all
made
their
appeal
to
him
but
it
was
the
villa
des
fleurs
which
brought
him
to
aix
not
that
he
played
for
anything
more
than
an
occasional
louis
nor
on
the
other
hand
was
he
merely
a
cold
he
had
a
or
two
in
his
pocket
on
most
evenings
at
the
service
of
the
victims
of
the
tables
but
the
pleasure
to
his
curious
and
dilettante
mind
lay
in
the
spectacle
of
the
battle
which
was
waged
night
after
night
between
raw
nature
and
good
manners
it
was
extraordinary
to
him
how
constantly
manners
prevailed
there
were
however
exceptions
for
instance
on
the
first
evening
of
this
particular
visit
he
found
the
rooms
hot
and
sauntered
out
into
the
little
semicircular
garden
at
the
back
he
sat
there
for
half
an
hour
under
a
flawless
sky
of
stars
watching
the
people
come
and
go
in
the
light
of
the
electric
lamps
and
appreciating
the
gowns
and
jewels
of
the
women
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
and
then
into
this
starlit
quiet
there
came
suddenly
a
flash
of
vivid
life
a
girl
in
a
soft
clinging
frock
of
white
satin
darted
swiftly
from
the
rooms
and
flung
herself
nervously
upon
a
bench
she
could
not
to
ricardo
thinking
be
more
than
twenty
years
of
age
she
was
certainly
quite
young
the
supple
slenderness
of
her
figure
proved
it
and
he
had
moreover
caught
a
glimpse
as
she
rushed
out
of
a
fresh
and
very
pretty
face
but
he
had
lost
sight
of
it
now
for
the
girl
wore
a
big
black
satin
hat
with
a
broad
brim
from
which
a
couple
of
white
ostrich
feathers
curved
over
at
the
back
and
in
the
shadow
of
that
hat
her
face
was
masked
all
that
he
could
see
was
a
pair
of
long
diamond
eardrops
which
sparkled
and
trembled
as
she
moved
her
head
and
that
she
did
constantly
now
she
stared
moodily
at
the
ground
now
she
flung
herself
back
then
she
twisted
nervously
to
the
right
and
then
a
moment
afterwards
to
the
left
and
then
again
she
stared
in
front
of
her
swinging
a
satin
slipper
backwards
and
forwards
against
the
pavement
with
the
petulance
of
a
child
all
her
movements
were
spasmodic
she
was
on
the
verge
of
hysteria
ricardo
was
expecting
her
to
burst
into
tears
when
she
sprang
up
and
as
swiftly
as
she
had
come
she
hurried
back
into
the
rooms
summer
lightning
thought
ricardo
near
to
him
a
woman
sneered
and
a
man
said
pityingly
she
was
pretty
that
little
one
it
is
regrettable
that
she
has
lost
a
few
minutes
afterwards
ricardo
finished
his
cigar
and
strolled
back
into
the
rooms
making
his
way
to
the
big
table
just
on
the
right
hand
of
the
entrance
where
the
play
as
a
rule
runs
high
it
was
clearly
running
high
for
so
deep
a
crowd
thronged
about
the
table
that
ricardo
could
only
by
standing
on
tiptoe
see
the
faces
of
the
players
of
the
banker
he
could
not
catch
a
glimpse
but
though
the
crowd
remained
its
units
were
constantly
changing
and
it
was
not
long
before
ricardo
found
himself
standing
in
the
front
rank
of
the
spectators
just
behind
the
players
seated
in
the
chairs
the
oval
green
table
was
spread
out
beneath
him
littered
with
ricardo
turned
his
eyes
to
the
left
and
saw
seated
at
the
middle
of
the
table
the
man
who
was
holding
the
bank
ricardo
recognised
him
with
a
start
of
surprise
he
was
a
young
englishman
harry
wethermill
who
after
a
brilliant
career
at
oxford
and
at
munich
had
so
turned
his
scientific
genius
to
account
that
he
had
made
a
fortune
for
himself
at
the
age
of
he
sat
at
the
table
with
the
indifferent
look
of
the
habitual
player
upon
his
cleanly
chiselled
face
but
it
was
plain
that
his
good
fortune
stayed
at
his
elbow
for
opposite
to
him
the
croupier
was
arranging
with
extraordinary
deftness
piles
of
in
the
order
of
their
value
the
bank
was
winning
heavily
even
as
ricardo
looked
wethermill
turned
up
a
natural
and
the
croupier
swept
in
the
stakes
from
either
side
faites
vos
jeux
messieurs
le
jeu
est
fait
the
croupier
cried
all
in
a
breath
and
repeated
the
words
wethermill
waited
with
his
hand
upon
the
wooden
frame
in
which
the
cards
were
stacked
he
glanced
round
the
table
while
the
stakes
were
being
laid
upon
the
cloth
and
suddenly
his
face
flashed
from
languor
into
interest
almost
opposite
to
him
a
small
hand
holding
a
note
was
thrust
forward
between
the
shoulders
of
two
men
seated
at
the
table
wethermill
leaned
forward
and
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
with
a
gesture
he
refused
the
stake
but
he
was
too
late
the
fingers
of
the
hand
had
opened
the
note
fluttered
down
on
to
the
cloth
the
money
was
staked
at
once
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
il
y
a
une
suite
he
said
quietly
he
relinquished
the
bank
rather
than
play
against
that
note
the
stakes
were
taken
up
by
their
owners
the
croupier
began
to
count
wethermill
winnings
and
ricardo
curious
to
know
whose
small
delicately
gloved
hand
it
was
which
had
brought
the
game
to
so
abrupt
a
termination
leaned
forward
he
recognised
the
young
girl
in
the
white
satin
dress
and
the
big
black
hat
whose
nerves
had
got
the
better
of
her
a
few
minutes
since
in
the
garden
he
saw
her
now
clearly
and
thought
her
of
an
entrancing
loveliness
she
was
moderately
tall
fair
of
skin
with
a
fresh
colouring
upon
her
cheeks
which
she
owed
to
nothing
but
her
youth
her
hair
was
of
a
light
brown
with
a
sheen
upon
it
her
forehead
broad
her
eyes
dark
and
wonderfully
clear
but
there
was
something
more
than
her
beauty
to
attract
him
he
had
a
strong
belief
that
somewhere
some
while
ago
he
had
already
seen
her
and
this
belief
grew
and
haunted
him
he
was
still
vaguely
puzzling
his
brains
to
fix
the
place
when
the
croupier
finished
his
reckoning
there
are
two
thousand
louis
in
the
bank
he
cried
who
will
take
on
the
bank
for
two
thousand
louis
no
one
however
was
willing
a
fresh
bank
was
put
up
for
sale
and
wethermill
still
sitting
in
the
dealer
chair
bought
it
he
spoke
at
once
to
an
attendant
and
the
man
slipped
round
the
table
and
forcing
his
way
through
the
crowd
carried
a
message
to
the
girl
in
the
black
hat
she
looked
towards
wethermill
and
smiled
and
the
smile
made
her
face
a
miracle
of
tenderness
then
she
disappeared
and
in
a
few
moments
ricardo
saw
a
way
open
in
the
throng
behind
the
banker
and
she
appeared
again
only
a
yard
or
two
away
just
behind
wethermill
he
turned
and
taking
her
hand
into
his
shook
it
chidingly
i
could
let
you
play
against
me
celia
he
said
in
english
my
luck
too
good
so
you
shall
be
my
partner
instead
i
put
in
the
capital
and
we
share
the
winnings
the
girl
face
flushed
rosily
her
hand
still
lay
clasped
in
his
she
made
no
effort
to
withdraw
it
i
could
do
that
she
exclaimed
why
not
said
he
see
and
loosening
her
fingers
he
took
from
them
the
note
and
tossed
it
over
to
the
croupier
to
be
added
to
his
bank
now
you
ca
help
yourself
we
partners
the
girl
laughed
and
the
company
at
the
table
smiled
half
in
sympathy
half
with
amusement
a
chair
was
brought
for
her
and
she
sat
down
behind
wethermill
her
lips
parted
her
face
joyous
with
excitement
but
all
at
once
wethermill
luck
deserted
him
he
renewed
his
bank
three
times
and
had
lost
the
greater
part
of
his
winnings
when
he
had
dealt
the
cards
through
he
took
a
fourth
bank
and
rose
from
that
too
a
loser
that
enough
celia
he
said
let
us
go
out
into
the
garden
it
will
be
cooler
there
i
have
taken
your
good
luck
away
said
the
girl
remorsefully
wethermill
put
his
arm
through
hers
you
have
to
take
yourself
away
before
you
can
do
that
he
answered
and
the
couple
walked
together
out
of
ricardo
hearing
ricardo
was
left
to
wonder
about
celia
she
was
just
one
of
those
problems
which
made
so
unfailingly
attractive
to
him
she
dwelt
in
some
street
of
bohemia
so
much
was
clear
the
frankness
of
her
pleasure
of
her
excitement
and
even
of
her
distress
proved
it
she
passed
from
one
to
the
other
while
you
could
deal
a
pack
of
cards
she
was
at
no
pains
to
wear
a
mask
moreover
she
was
a
young
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
running
about
those
rooms
alone
as
unembarrassed
as
if
she
had
been
at
home
there
was
the
free
use
too
of
christian
names
certainly
she
dwelt
in
bohemia
but
it
seemed
to
ricardo
that
she
could
pass
in
any
company
and
yet
not
be
overpassed
she
would
look
a
little
more
picturesque
than
most
girls
of
her
age
and
she
was
certainly
a
good
deal
more
soignee
than
many
and
she
had
the
frenchwoman
knack
of
putting
on
her
clothes
but
those
would
be
all
the
differences
leaving
out
the
frankness
ricardo
wondered
in
what
street
of
bohemia
she
dwelt
he
wondered
still
more
when
he
saw
her
again
half
an
hour
afterwards
at
the
entrance
to
the
villa
des
fleurs
she
came
down
the
long
hall
with
harry
wethermill
at
her
side
the
couple
were
walking
slowly
and
talking
as
they
walked
with
so
complete
an
absorption
in
each
other
that
they
were
unaware
of
their
surroundings
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
a
stout
woman
of
and
and
raddled
with
paint
watched
their
approach
with
a
smile
of
amusement
when
they
came
near
enough
to
hear
she
said
in
french
well
celie
are
you
ready
to
go
home
the
girl
looked
up
with
a
start
of
course
madame
she
said
with
a
certain
submissiveness
which
surprised
ricardo
i
hope
i
have
not
kept
you
waiting
she
ran
to
the
and
came
back
again
with
her
cloak
harry
she
said
dwelling
upon
his
name
and
looking
out
upon
him
with
soft
and
smiling
eyes
i
shall
see
you
evening
he
said
holding
her
hand
again
she
let
it
stay
within
his
keeping
but
she
frowned
and
a
sudden
gravity
settled
like
a
cloud
upon
her
face
she
turned
to
the
elder
woman
with
a
sort
of
appeal
no
i
do
not
think
we
shall
be
here
shall
we
madame
she
said
reluctantly
of
course
not
said
madame
briskly
you
have
not
forgotten
what
we
have
planned
no
we
shall
not
be
here
but
the
night
after
yes
celia
turned
back
again
to
wethermill
yes
we
have
plans
for
she
said
with
a
very
wistful
note
of
regret
in
her
voice
and
seeing
that
madame
was
already
at
the
door
she
bent
forward
and
said
timidly
but
the
night
after
i
shall
want
you
i
shall
thank
you
for
wanting
me
wethermill
rejoined
and
the
girl
tore
her
hand
away
and
ran
up
the
steps
harry
wethermill
returned
to
the
rooms
ricardo
did
not
follow
him
he
was
too
busy
with
the
little
problem
which
had
been
presented
to
him
that
night
what
could
that
girl
he
asked
himself
have
in
common
with
the
raddled
woman
she
addressed
so
respectfully
indeed
there
had
been
a
note
of
more
than
respect
in
her
voice
there
had
been
something
of
affection
again
ricardo
found
himself
wondering
in
what
street
in
bohemia
celia
dwelt
and
as
he
walked
up
to
the
hotel
there
came
yet
other
questions
to
amuse
him
why
he
asked
could
neither
celia
nor
madame
come
to
the
villa
des
fleurs
night
what
are
the
plans
they
have
made
and
what
was
it
in
those
plans
which
had
brought
the
sudden
gravity
and
reluctance
into
celia
face
ricardo
had
reason
to
remember
those
questions
during
the
next
few
days
though
he
only
idled
with
them
now
chapter
ii
a
cry
for
help
it
was
on
a
monday
evening
that
ricardo
saw
harry
wethermill
and
the
girl
celia
together
on
the
tuesday
he
saw
wethermill
in
the
rooms
alone
and
had
some
talk
with
him
wethermill
was
not
playing
that
night
and
about
ten
the
two
men
left
the
villa
des
fleurs
together
which
way
do
you
go
asked
wethermill
up
the
hill
to
the
hotel
majestic
said
ricardo
we
go
together
then
i
too
am
staying
there
said
the
young
man
and
they
climbed
the
steep
streets
together
ricardo
was
dying
to
put
some
questions
about
wethermill
young
friend
of
the
night
before
but
discretion
kept
him
reluctantly
silent
they
chatted
for
a
few
moments
in
the
hall
upon
indifferent
topics
and
so
separated
for
the
night
ricardo
however
was
to
learn
something
more
of
celia
the
next
morning
for
while
he
was
fixing
his
tie
before
the
mirror
wethermill
burst
into
his
ricardo
forgot
his
curiosity
in
the
surge
of
his
indignation
such
an
invasion
was
an
unprecedented
outrage
upon
the
gentle
tenor
of
his
life
the
business
of
the
morning
toilette
was
sacred
to
interrupt
it
carried
a
subtle
suggestion
of
anarchy
where
was
his
valet
where
was
charles
who
should
have
guarded
the
door
like
the
custodian
of
a
chapel
i
can
not
speak
to
you
for
at
least
another
said
ricardo
sternly
but
harry
wethermill
was
out
of
breath
and
shaking
with
agitation
i
ca
wait
he
cried
with
a
passionate
appeal
i
have
got
to
see
you
you
must
help
me
ricardo
you
must
indeed
ricardo
spun
round
upon
his
heel
at
first
he
had
thought
that
the
help
wanted
was
the
help
usually
wanted
at
a
glance
at
wethermills
face
however
and
the
ringing
note
of
anguish
in
his
voice
told
him
that
the
thought
was
wrong
ricardo
slipped
out
of
his
affectations
as
out
of
a
loose
coat
what
has
happened
he
asked
quietly
something
terrible
with
shaking
fingers
wethermill
held
out
a
newspaper
read
it
he
said
it
was
a
special
edition
of
a
local
newspaper
le
journal
de
savoie
and
it
bore
the
date
of
that
morning
they
are
crying
it
in
the
streets
said
wethermill
read
a
short
paragraph
was
printed
in
large
black
letters
on
the
first
page
and
leaped
to
the
eyes
late
last
night
it
ran
an
appalling
murder
was
committed
at
the
villa
rose
on
the
road
to
lac
bourget
mme
camille
dauvray
an
elderly
rich
woman
who
was
well
known
at
aix
and
had
occupied
the
villa
every
summer
for
the
last
few
years
was
discovered
on
the
floor
of
her
salon
fully
dressed
and
brutally
strangled
while
upstairs
her
maid
helene
vauquier
was
found
in
bed
chloroformed
with
her
hands
tied
securely
behind
her
back
at
the
time
of
going
to
press
she
had
not
recovered
consciousness
but
the
doctor
emile
peytin
is
in
attendance
upon
her
and
it
is
hoped
that
she
will
be
able
shortly
to
throw
some
light
on
this
dastardly
affair
the
police
are
properly
reticent
as
to
the
details
of
the
crime
but
the
following
statement
may
be
accepted
without
hesitation
the
murder
was
discovered
at
twelve
at
night
by
the
perrichet
to
whose
intelligence
more
than
a
word
of
praise
is
due
and
it
is
obvious
from
the
absence
of
all
marks
upon
the
door
and
windows
that
the
murderer
was
admitted
from
within
the
villa
meanwhile
mme
dauvray
has
disappeared
and
with
it
a
young
englishwoman
who
came
to
aix
with
her
as
her
companion
the
motive
of
the
crime
leaps
to
the
eyes
mme
dauvray
was
famous
in
aix
for
her
jewels
which
she
wore
with
too
little
prudence
the
condition
of
the
house
shows
that
a
careful
search
was
made
for
them
and
they
have
disappeared
it
is
anticipated
that
a
description
of
the
young
englishwoman
with
a
reward
for
her
apprehension
will
be
issued
immediately
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
hope
that
the
citizens
of
aix
and
indeed
of
france
will
be
cleared
of
all
participation
in
so
cruel
and
sinister
a
crime
ricardo
read
through
the
paragraph
with
a
growing
consternation
and
laid
the
paper
upon
his
it
is
infamous
cried
wethermill
passionately
the
young
englishwoman
is
i
suppose
your
friend
miss
celia
said
ricardo
slowly
wethermill
started
forward
you
know
her
then
he
cried
in
amazement
no
but
i
saw
her
with
you
in
the
rooms
i
heard
you
call
her
by
that
name
you
saw
us
together
exclaimed
wethermill
then
you
can
understand
how
infamous
the
suggestion
is
but
ricardo
had
seen
the
girl
half
an
hour
before
he
had
seen
her
with
harry
wethermill
he
could
not
but
vividly
remember
the
picture
of
her
as
she
flung
herself
on
to
the
bench
in
the
garden
in
a
moment
of
hysteria
and
petulantly
kicked
a
satin
slipper
backwards
and
forwards
against
the
stones
she
was
young
she
was
pretty
she
had
a
charm
of
freshness
but
but
strive
against
it
as
he
would
this
picture
in
the
recollection
began
more
and
more
to
wear
a
sinister
aspect
he
remembered
some
words
spoken
by
a
stranger
she
is
pretty
that
little
one
it
is
regrettable
that
she
has
lost
ricardo
arranged
his
tie
with
even
a
greater
deliberation
than
he
usually
employed
and
mme
dauvray
he
asked
she
was
the
stout
woman
with
whom
your
young
friend
went
away
yes
said
wethermill
ricardo
turned
round
from
the
mirror
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
hanaud
is
at
aix
he
is
the
cleverest
of
the
french
detectives
you
know
him
he
dined
with
you
once
it
was
ricardo
practice
to
collect
celebrities
round
his
and
at
one
such
gathering
hanaud
and
wethermill
had
been
present
together
you
wish
me
to
approach
him
at
once
it
is
a
delicate
position
said
ricardo
here
is
a
man
in
charge
of
a
case
of
murder
and
we
are
quietly
to
go
to
him
to
his
relief
wethermill
interrupted
him
no
no
he
cried
he
is
not
in
charge
of
the
case
he
is
on
his
holiday
i
read
of
his
arrival
two
days
ago
in
the
newspaper
it
was
stated
that
he
came
for
rest
what
i
want
is
that
he
should
take
charge
of
the
case
the
superb
confidence
of
wethermill
shook
ricardo
for
a
moment
but
his
recollections
were
too
clear
you
are
going
out
of
your
way
to
launch
the
acutest
of
french
detectives
in
search
of
this
girl
are
you
wise
wethermill
wethermill
sprang
up
from
his
chair
in
desperation
you
too
think
her
guilty
you
have
seen
her
you
think
her
guilty
like
this
detestable
newspaper
like
the
police
like
the
police
asked
ricardo
sharply
yes
said
harry
wethermill
sullenly
as
soon
as
i
saw
that
rag
i
ran
down
to
the
villa
the
police
are
in
possession
they
would
not
let
me
into
the
garden
but
i
talked
with
one
of
them
they
too
think
that
she
let
in
the
murderers
ricardo
took
a
turn
across
the
room
then
he
came
to
a
stop
in
front
of
wethermill
listen
to
me
he
said
solemnly
i
saw
this
girl
half
an
hour
before
i
saw
you
she
rushed
out
into
the
garden
she
flung
herself
on
to
a
bench
she
could
not
sit
still
she
was
hysterical
you
know
what
that
means
she
had
been
losing
that
point
number
one
ricardo
ticked
it
off
upon
his
finger
she
ran
back
into
the
rooms
you
asked
her
to
share
the
winnings
of
your
bank
she
consented
eagerly
and
you
lost
that
point
number
two
a
little
later
as
she
was
going
away
you
asked
her
whether
she
would
be
in
the
rooms
the
next
night
yesterday
night
the
night
when
the
murder
was
committed
her
face
clouded
over
she
hesitated
she
became
more
than
grave
there
was
a
distinct
impression
as
though
she
shrank
from
the
contemplation
of
what
it
was
proposed
she
should
do
on
the
next
night
and
then
she
answered
you
we
have
other
plans
that
number
three
and
ricardo
ticked
off
his
third
point
now
he
asked
do
you
still
ask
me
to
launch
hanaud
upon
the
case
yes
and
at
once
cried
wethermill
ricardo
called
for
his
hat
and
his
stick
you
know
where
hanaud
is
staying
he
asked
yes
replied
wethermill
and
he
led
ricardo
to
an
unpretentious
little
hotel
in
the
centre
of
the
town
ricardo
sent
in
his
name
and
the
two
visitors
were
immediately
shown
into
a
small
where
hanaud
was
enjoying
his
morning
chocolate
he
was
stout
and
with
a
full
and
almost
heavy
face
in
his
morning
suit
at
his
he
looked
like
a
prosperous
comedian
he
came
forward
with
a
smile
of
welcome
extending
both
his
hands
to
ricardo
ah
my
good
friend
he
said
it
is
pleasant
to
see
you
and
wethermill
he
exclaimed
holding
a
hand
out
to
the
young
inventor
you
remember
me
then
said
wethermill
gladly
it
is
my
profession
to
remember
people
said
hanaud
with
a
laugh
you
were
at
that
amusing
of
ricardo
in
grosvenor
square
monsieur
said
wethermill
i
have
come
to
ask
your
help
the
note
of
appeal
in
his
voice
was
loud
hanaud
drew
up
a
chair
by
the
window
and
motioned
to
wethermill
to
take
it
he
pointed
to
another
with
a
bow
of
invitation
to
ricardo
let
me
hear
he
said
gravely
it
is
the
murder
of
mme
dauvray
said
wethermill
hanaud
started
and
in
what
way
monsieur
he
asked
are
you
interested
in
the
murder
of
mme
dauvray
her
companion
said
wethermill
the
young
english
girl
she
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
hanaud
face
grew
stern
then
came
a
sparkle
of
anger
in
his
eyes
and
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
monsieur
he
asked
coldly
you
are
upon
your
holiday
hanaud
i
wish
you
no
i
implore
you
wethermill
cried
his
voice
ringing
with
passion
to
take
up
this
case
to
discover
the
truth
to
find
out
what
has
become
of
celia
hanaud
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
upon
the
arms
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
harry
wethermill
but
the
anger
died
out
of
them
monsieur
he
said
i
do
not
know
what
your
procedure
is
in
england
but
in
france
a
detective
does
not
take
up
a
case
or
leave
it
alone
according
to
his
pleasure
we
are
only
servants
this
affair
is
in
the
hands
of
fleuriot
the
juge
of
aix
but
if
you
offered
him
your
help
it
would
be
welcomed
cried
wethermill
and
to
me
that
would
mean
so
much
there
would
be
no
bungling
there
would
be
no
waste
of
time
of
that
one
would
be
sure
hanaud
shook
his
head
gently
his
eyes
were
softened
now
by
a
look
of
pity
suddenly
he
stretched
out
a
forefinger
you
have
perhaps
a
photograph
of
the
young
lady
in
that
in
your
wethermill
flushed
red
and
drawing
out
the
handed
the
portrait
to
hanaud
hanaud
looked
at
it
carefully
for
a
few
moments
it
was
taken
lately
here
he
asked
yes
for
me
replied
wethermill
quietly
and
it
is
a
good
likeness
very
how
long
have
you
known
this
mlle
celie
he
asked
wethermill
looked
at
hanaud
with
a
certain
defiance
for
a
fortnight
hanaud
raised
his
eyebrows
you
met
her
here
yes
in
the
rooms
i
suppose
not
at
the
house
of
one
of
your
friends
that
is
so
said
wethermill
quietly
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
met
her
in
paris
introduced
me
to
her
at
my
request
hanaud
handed
back
the
portrait
and
drew
forward
his
chair
nearer
to
wethermill
his
face
had
grown
friendly
he
spoke
with
a
tone
of
respect
monsieur
i
know
something
of
you
our
friend
ricardo
told
me
your
history
i
asked
him
for
it
when
i
saw
you
at
his
dinner
you
are
of
those
about
whom
one
does
ask
questions
and
i
know
that
you
are
not
a
romantic
boy
but
who
shall
say
that
he
is
safe
from
the
appeal
of
beauty
i
have
seen
women
monsieur
for
whose
purity
of
soul
i
would
myself
have
stood
security
condemned
for
complicity
in
brutal
crimes
on
evidence
that
could
not
be
gainsaid
and
i
have
known
them
turn
and
hideous
to
look
upon
the
moment
after
their
just
sentence
has
been
pronounced
no
doubt
monsieur
said
wethermill
with
perfect
quietude
but
celia
harland
is
not
one
of
those
women
i
do
not
now
say
that
she
is
said
hanaud
but
the
juge
here
has
already
sent
to
me
to
ask
for
my
assistance
and
i
refused
i
replied
that
i
was
just
a
good
bourgeois
enjoying
his
holiday
still
it
is
difficult
quite
to
forget
one
profession
it
was
the
commissaire
of
police
who
came
to
me
and
naturally
i
talked
with
him
for
a
little
while
the
case
is
dark
monsieur
i
warn
you
how
dark
asked
harry
wethermill
i
will
tell
you
said
hanaud
drawing
his
chair
still
closer
to
the
young
man
understand
this
in
the
first
place
there
was
an
accomplice
within
the
villa
some
one
let
the
murderers
in
there
is
no
sign
of
an
entrance
being
forced
no
lock
was
picked
there
is
no
mark
of
a
thumb
on
any
panel
no
sign
of
a
bolt
being
forced
there
was
an
accomplice
within
the
house
we
start
from
that
wethermill
nodded
his
head
sullenly
ricardo
drew
his
chair
up
towards
the
others
but
hanaud
was
not
at
that
moment
interested
in
ricardo
well
then
let
us
see
who
there
are
in
mme
dauvray
household
the
list
is
not
a
long
one
it
was
mme
dauvray
habit
to
take
her
luncheon
and
her
dinner
at
the
restaurants
and
her
maid
was
all
that
she
required
to
get
ready
her
dejeuner
in
the
morning
and
her
at
night
let
us
take
the
members
of
the
household
one
by
one
there
is
first
the
chauffeur
henri
servettaz
he
was
not
at
the
villa
last
night
he
came
back
to
it
early
this
morning
ah
said
ricardo
in
a
significant
exclamation
wethermill
did
not
stir
he
sat
still
as
a
stone
with
a
face
deadly
white
and
eyes
burning
upon
hanaud
face
but
wait
said
hanaud
holding
up
a
warning
hand
to
ricardo
servettaz
was
in
chambery
where
his
parents
live
he
travelled
to
chambery
by
the
two
train
yesterday
he
was
with
them
in
the
afternoon
he
went
with
them
to
a
cafe
in
the
evening
moreover
early
this
morning
the
maid
helene
vauquier
was
able
to
speak
a
few
words
in
answer
to
a
question
she
said
servettaz
was
in
chambery
she
gave
his
address
a
telephone
message
was
sent
to
the
police
in
that
town
and
servettaz
was
found
in
bed
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
impossible
that
servettaz
was
concerned
in
the
crime
that
we
shall
see
but
it
is
quite
clear
i
think
that
it
was
not
he
who
opened
the
house
to
the
murderers
for
he
was
at
chambery
in
the
evening
and
the
murder
was
already
discovered
here
by
midnight
moreover
it
is
a
small
point
he
lives
not
in
the
house
but
over
the
garage
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
then
besides
the
chauffeur
there
was
a
charwoman
a
woman
of
aix
who
came
each
morning
at
seven
and
left
in
the
evening
at
seven
or
eight
sometimes
she
would
stay
later
if
the
maid
was
alone
in
the
house
for
the
maid
is
nervous
but
she
left
last
night
before
nine
there
is
evidence
of
that
and
the
murder
did
not
take
place
until
afterwards
that
is
also
a
fact
not
a
conjecture
we
can
leave
the
charwoman
who
for
the
rest
has
the
best
of
characters
out
of
our
calculations
there
remain
then
the
maid
helene
vauquier
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
mlle
celie
hanaud
reached
out
for
the
matches
and
lit
a
cigarette
let
us
take
first
the
maid
helene
vauquier
forty
years
old
a
normandy
peasant
woman
they
are
not
bad
people
the
normandy
peasants
monsieur
avaricious
no
doubt
but
on
the
whole
honest
and
most
respectable
we
know
something
of
helene
vauquier
monsieur
see
and
he
took
up
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
table
the
paper
was
folded
lengthwise
written
upon
only
on
the
inside
i
have
some
details
here
our
police
system
is
i
think
a
little
more
complete
than
yours
in
england
helene
vauquier
has
served
mme
dauvray
for
seven
years
she
has
been
the
confidential
friend
rather
than
the
maid
and
mark
this
wethermill
during
those
seven
years
how
many
opportunities
has
she
had
of
conniving
at
last
night
crime
she
was
found
chloroformed
and
bound
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
was
chloroformed
upon
that
point
peytin
is
quite
quite
certain
he
saw
her
before
she
recovered
consciousness
she
was
violently
sick
on
awakening
she
sank
again
into
unconsciousness
she
is
only
now
in
a
natural
sleep
besides
those
people
there
is
mlle
celie
of
her
monsieur
nothing
is
known
you
yourself
know
nothing
of
her
she
comes
suddenly
to
aix
as
the
companion
of
mme
dauvray
a
young
and
pretty
english
girl
how
did
she
become
the
companion
of
mme
dauvray
wethermill
stirred
uneasily
in
his
seat
his
face
flushed
to
ricardo
that
had
been
from
the
beginning
the
most
interesting
problem
of
the
case
was
he
to
have
the
answer
now
i
do
not
know
answered
wethermill
with
some
hesitation
and
then
it
seemed
that
he
was
at
once
ashamed
of
his
hesitation
his
accent
gathered
strength
and
in
a
low
but
ringing
voice
he
added
but
i
say
this
you
have
told
me
hanaud
of
women
who
looked
innocent
and
were
guilty
but
you
know
also
of
women
and
girls
who
can
live
untainted
and
unspoilt
amidst
surroundings
which
are
suspicious
hanaud
listened
but
he
neither
agreed
nor
denied
he
took
up
a
second
slip
of
paper
i
shall
tell
you
something
now
of
mme
dauvray
he
said
we
will
not
take
up
her
early
history
it
might
not
be
edifying
and
poor
woman
she
is
dead
let
us
not
go
back
beyond
her
marriage
seventeen
years
ago
to
a
wealthy
manufacturer
of
nancy
whom
she
had
met
in
paris
seven
years
ago
dauvray
died
leaving
his
widow
a
very
rich
woman
she
had
a
passion
for
jewellery
which
she
was
now
able
to
gratify
she
collected
jewels
a
famous
necklace
a
stone
she
was
not
as
you
say
happy
till
she
got
it
she
had
a
fortune
in
precious
stones
oh
but
a
large
fortune
by
the
ostentation
of
her
jewels
she
paraded
her
wealth
here
at
monte
carlo
in
paris
besides
that
she
was
and
most
impressionable
finally
she
was
like
so
many
of
her
class
superstitious
to
the
degree
of
folly
suddenly
ricardo
started
in
his
chair
superstitious
the
word
was
a
sudden
light
upon
his
darkness
now
he
knew
what
had
perplexed
him
during
the
last
two
days
clearly
too
clearly
he
remembered
where
he
had
seen
celia
harland
and
when
a
picture
rose
before
his
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
strengthen
like
a
film
in
a
as
hanaud
continued
very
well
take
mme
dauvray
as
we
find
her
rich
ostentatious
easily
taken
by
a
new
face
generous
and
foolishly
superstitious
and
you
have
in
her
a
living
provocation
to
every
rogue
by
a
hundred
instances
she
proclaimed
herself
a
dupe
she
threw
down
a
challenge
to
every
criminal
to
come
and
rob
her
for
seven
years
helene
vauquier
stands
at
her
elbow
and
protects
her
from
serious
trouble
suddenly
there
is
added
to
her
your
young
friend
and
she
is
robbed
and
murdered
and
follow
this
wethermill
our
thieves
are
i
think
more
brutal
to
their
victims
than
is
the
case
with
you
wethermill
shut
his
eyes
in
a
spasm
of
pain
and
the
pallor
of
his
face
increased
suppose
that
celia
were
one
of
the
victims
he
cried
in
a
stifled
voice
hanaud
glanced
at
him
with
a
look
of
commiseration
that
perhaps
we
shall
see
he
said
but
what
i
meant
was
this
a
stranger
like
mlle
celie
might
be
the
accomplice
in
such
a
crime
as
the
crime
of
the
villa
rose
meaning
only
robbery
a
stranger
might
only
have
discovered
too
late
that
murder
would
be
added
to
the
theft
meanwhile
in
strong
clear
colours
ricardo
picture
stood
out
before
his
eyes
he
was
startled
by
hearing
wethermill
say
in
a
firm
voice
my
friend
ricardo
has
something
to
add
to
what
you
have
said
i
exclaimed
ricardo
how
in
the
world
could
wethermill
know
of
that
clear
picture
in
his
mind
yes
you
saw
celia
harland
on
the
evening
before
the
murder
ricardo
stared
at
his
friend
it
seemed
to
him
that
harry
wethermill
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
here
he
was
corroborating
the
suspicions
of
the
police
by
facts
damning
and
incontrovertible
facts
on
the
night
before
the
murder
continued
wethermill
quietly
celia
harland
lost
money
at
the
ricardo
saw
her
in
the
garden
behind
the
rooms
and
she
was
hysterical
later
on
that
same
night
he
saw
her
again
with
me
and
he
heard
what
she
said
i
asked
her
to
come
to
the
rooms
on
the
next
evening
yesterday
the
night
of
the
crime
and
her
face
changed
and
she
said
we
have
other
plans
for
but
the
night
after
i
shall
want
you
hanaud
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
you
tell
me
these
two
things
he
cried
yes
said
wethermill
you
were
kind
enough
to
say
to
me
i
was
not
a
romantic
boy
i
am
not
i
can
face
facts
hanaud
stared
at
his
companion
for
a
few
moments
then
with
a
remarkable
air
of
consideration
he
bowed
you
have
won
monsieur
he
said
i
will
take
up
this
case
but
and
his
face
grew
stern
and
he
brought
his
fist
down
upon
the
table
with
a
bang
i
shall
follow
it
to
the
end
now
be
the
consequences
bitter
as
death
to
you
that
is
what
i
wish
monsieur
said
wethermill
hanaud
locked
up
the
slips
of
paper
in
his
lettercase
then
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
we
will
begin
at
the
beginning
he
said
briskly
i
have
telephoned
to
the
depot
perrichet
the
who
discovered
the
crime
will
be
here
at
once
we
will
walk
down
to
the
villa
with
him
and
on
the
way
he
shall
tell
us
exactly
what
he
discovered
and
how
he
discovered
it
at
the
villa
we
shall
find
monsieur
fleuriot
the
juge
who
has
already
begun
his
examination
and
the
commissaire
of
police
in
company
with
them
we
will
inspect
the
villa
except
for
the
removal
of
mme
dauvray
body
from
the
salon
to
her
bedroom
and
the
opening
of
the
windows
the
house
remains
exactly
as
it
was
we
may
come
with
you
cried
harry
wethermill
eagerly
yes
on
one
condition
that
you
ask
no
questions
and
answer
none
unless
i
put
them
to
you
listen
watch
examine
but
no
interruptions
hanaud
manner
had
altogether
changed
it
was
now
authoritative
and
alert
he
turned
to
ricardo
you
will
swear
to
what
you
saw
in
the
garden
and
to
the
words
you
heard
he
asked
they
are
important
yes
said
ricardo
but
he
kept
silence
about
that
clear
picture
in
his
mind
which
to
him
seemed
no
less
important
no
less
suggestive
the
assembly
hall
at
leamington
a
crowded
audience
chiefly
of
ladies
a
platform
at
one
end
on
which
a
black
cabinet
stood
a
man
erect
and
with
something
of
the
soldier
in
his
bearing
led
forward
a
girl
pretty
and
who
wore
a
black
velvet
dress
with
a
long
sweeping
train
she
moved
like
one
in
a
dream
some
people
from
the
audience
climbed
on
to
the
platform
tied
the
girl
hands
with
tape
behind
her
back
and
sealed
the
tape
she
was
led
to
the
cabinet
and
in
full
view
of
the
audience
fastened
to
a
bench
then
the
door
of
the
cabinet
was
closed
the
people
upon
the
platform
descended
into
the
body
of
the
hall
and
the
lights
were
turned
very
low
the
audience
sat
in
suspense
and
then
abruptly
in
the
silence
and
the
darkness
there
came
the
rattle
of
a
tambourine
from
the
empty
platform
rappings
and
knockings
seemed
to
flicker
round
the
panels
of
the
hall
and
in
the
place
where
the
door
of
the
cabinet
should
be
there
appeared
a
splash
of
misty
whiteness
the
whiteness
shaped
itself
dimly
into
the
figure
of
a
woman
a
face
dark
and
eastern
became
visible
and
a
deep
voice
spoke
in
a
chant
of
the
nile
and
antony
then
the
vision
faded
the
tambourines
and
cymbals
rattled
again
the
lights
were
turned
up
the
door
of
the
cabinet
thrown
open
and
the
girl
in
the
black
velvet
dress
was
seen
fastened
upon
the
bench
within
it
was
a
spiritualistic
performance
at
which
julius
ricardo
had
been
present
two
years
ago
the
young
girl
in
black
velvet
the
medium
was
celia
harland
that
was
the
picture
which
was
in
ricardo
mind
and
description
of
mme
dauvray
made
a
terrible
commentary
upon
it
easily
taken
by
a
new
face
generous
and
foolishly
superstitious
a
living
provocation
to
every
rogue
those
were
the
words
and
here
was
a
beautiful
girl
of
twenty
versed
in
those
very
tricks
of
imposture
which
would
make
mme
dauvray
her
natural
prey
ricardo
looked
at
wethermill
doubtful
whether
he
should
tell
what
he
knew
of
celia
harland
or
not
but
before
he
had
decided
a
knock
came
upon
the
door
here
is
perrichet
said
hanaud
taking
up
his
hat
we
will
go
down
to
the
villa
rose
chapter
iii
perrichet
story
perrichet
was
a
young
man
with
a
red
fair
face
and
a
moustache
and
hair
so
pale
in
colour
that
they
were
almost
silver
he
came
into
the
room
with
an
air
of
importance
aha
said
hanaud
with
a
malicious
smile
you
went
to
bed
late
last
night
my
friend
yet
you
were
up
early
enough
to
read
the
newspaper
well
i
am
to
have
the
honour
of
being
associated
with
you
in
this
case
perrichet
twirled
his
cap
awkwardly
and
blushed
monsieur
is
pleased
to
laugh
at
me
he
said
but
it
was
not
i
who
called
myself
intelligent
though
indeed
i
would
like
to
be
so
for
the
good
god
knows
i
do
not
look
it
hanaud
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
then
congratulate
yourself
it
is
a
great
advantage
to
be
intelligent
and
not
to
look
it
we
shall
get
on
famously
come
the
four
men
descended
the
stairs
and
as
they
walked
towards
the
villa
perrichet
related
concisely
and
clearly
his
experience
of
the
night
i
passed
the
gate
of
the
villa
about
nine
he
said
the
gate
was
closed
above
the
wall
and
bushes
of
the
garden
i
saw
a
bright
light
in
the
room
upon
the
first
floor
which
faces
the
road
at
the
comer
of
the
villa
the
lower
windows
i
could
not
see
more
than
an
hour
afterwards
i
came
back
and
as
i
passed
the
villa
again
i
noticed
that
there
was
now
no
light
in
the
room
upon
the
first
floor
but
that
the
gate
was
open
i
thereupon
went
into
the
garden
and
pulling
the
gate
let
it
swing
to
and
latch
but
it
occurred
to
me
as
i
did
so
that
there
might
be
visitors
at
the
villa
who
had
not
yet
left
and
for
whom
the
gate
had
been
set
open
i
accordingly
followed
the
drive
which
winds
round
to
the
front
door
the
front
door
is
not
on
the
side
of
the
villa
which
faces
the
road
but
at
the
back
when
i
came
to
the
open
space
where
the
carriages
turn
i
saw
that
the
house
was
in
complete
darkness
there
were
wooden
latticed
doors
to
the
long
windows
on
the
ground
floor
and
these
were
closed
i
tried
one
to
make
certain
and
found
the
fastenings
secure
the
other
windows
upon
that
floor
were
shuttered
no
light
gleamed
anywhere
i
then
left
the
garden
closing
the
gate
behind
me
i
heard
a
clock
strike
the
hour
a
few
minutes
afterwards
so
that
i
can
be
sure
of
the
time
it
was
now
eleven
i
came
round
a
third
time
an
hour
after
and
to
my
astonishment
i
found
the
gate
once
more
open
i
had
left
it
closed
and
the
house
shut
up
and
dark
now
it
stood
open
i
looked
up
to
the
windows
and
i
saw
that
in
a
room
on
the
second
floor
close
beneath
the
roof
a
light
was
burning
brightly
that
room
had
been
dark
an
hour
before
i
stood
and
watched
the
light
for
a
few
minutes
thinking
that
i
should
see
it
suddenly
go
out
but
it
did
not
it
burned
quite
steadily
this
light
and
the
gate
opened
and
reopened
aroused
my
suspicions
i
went
again
into
the
garden
but
this
time
with
greater
caution
it
was
a
clear
night
and
although
there
was
no
moon
i
could
see
without
the
aid
of
my
lantern
i
stole
quietly
along
the
drive
when
i
came
round
to
the
front
door
i
noticed
immediately
that
the
shutters
of
one
of
the
windows
were
swung
back
and
that
the
inside
glass
window
which
descended
to
the
ground
stood
open
the
sight
gave
me
a
shock
within
the
house
those
shutters
had
been
opened
i
felt
the
blood
turn
to
ice
in
my
veins
and
a
chill
crept
along
my
spine
i
thought
of
that
solitary
light
burning
steadily
under
the
roof
i
was
convinced
that
something
terrible
had
happened
yes
yes
quite
so
said
hanaud
go
on
my
friend
the
interior
of
the
room
gaped
black
perrichet
resumed
i
crept
up
to
the
window
at
the
side
of
the
wall
and
flashed
my
lantern
into
the
room
the
window
however
was
in
a
recess
which
opened
into
the
room
through
an
arch
and
at
each
side
of
the
arch
curtains
were
draped
the
curtains
were
not
closed
but
between
them
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
strip
of
the
room
i
stepped
carefully
in
taking
heed
not
to
walk
on
the
patch
of
grass
before
the
window
the
light
of
my
lantern
showed
me
a
chair
overturned
upon
the
floor
and
to
my
right
below
the
middle
one
of
the
three
windows
in
the
side
wall
a
woman
lying
huddled
upon
the
floor
it
was
mme
dauvray
she
was
dressed
there
was
a
little
mud
upon
her
shoes
as
though
she
had
walked
after
the
rain
had
ceased
monsieur
will
remember
that
two
heavy
showers
fell
last
evening
between
six
and
eight
yes
said
hanaud
nodding
his
approval
she
was
quite
dead
her
face
was
terribly
swollen
and
black
and
a
piece
of
thin
strong
cord
was
knotted
so
tightly
about
her
neck
and
had
sunk
so
deeply
into
her
flesh
that
at
first
i
did
not
see
it
for
mme
dauvray
was
stout
then
what
did
you
do
asked
hanaud
i
went
to
the
telephone
which
was
in
the
hall
and
rang
up
the
police
then
i
crept
upstairs
very
cautiously
trying
the
doors
i
came
upon
no
one
until
i
reached
the
room
under
the
roof
where
the
light
was
burning
there
i
found
helene
vauquier
the
maid
snoring
in
bed
in
a
terrible
fashion
the
four
men
turned
a
bend
in
the
road
a
few
paces
away
a
knot
of
people
stood
before
a
gate
which
a
guarded
but
here
we
are
at
the
villa
said
hanaud
they
all
looked
up
and
from
a
window
at
the
corner
upon
the
first
floor
a
man
looked
out
and
drew
in
his
head
that
is
besnard
the
commissaire
of
our
police
in
aix
said
perrichet
and
the
window
from
which
he
looked
said
hanaud
must
be
the
window
of
that
room
in
which
you
saw
the
bright
light
at
nine
on
your
first
round
yes
said
perrichet
that
is
the
window
they
stopped
at
the
gate
perrichet
spoke
to
the
who
at
once
held
the
gate
open
the
party
passed
into
the
garden
of
the
villa
chapter
iv
at
the
villa
the
drive
curved
between
trees
and
high
bushes
towards
the
back
of
the
house
and
as
the
party
advanced
along
it
a
small
trim
man
with
a
pointed
beard
came
to
meet
them
it
was
the
man
who
had
looked
out
from
the
window
louis
besnard
the
commissaire
of
police
you
are
coming
then
to
help
us
m
hanaud
he
cried
extending
his
hands
you
will
find
no
jealousy
here
no
spirit
amongst
us
of
anything
but
good
will
no
desire
except
one
to
carry
out
your
suggestions
all
we
wish
is
that
the
murderers
should
be
discovered
mon
dieu
what
a
crime
and
so
young
a
girl
to
be
involved
in
it
but
what
will
you
so
you
have
already
made
your
mind
up
on
that
point
said
hanaud
sharply
the
commissaire
shrugged
his
shoulders
examine
the
villa
and
then
judge
for
yourself
whether
any
other
explanation
is
conceivable
he
said
and
turning
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
house
then
he
cried
ah
and
drew
himself
into
an
attitude
of
attention
a
tall
thin
man
of
about
years
dressed
in
a
frock
coat
and
a
high
silk
hat
had
just
come
round
an
angle
of
the
drive
and
was
moving
slowly
towards
them
he
wore
the
soft
curling
brown
beard
of
one
who
has
never
used
a
razor
on
his
chin
and
had
a
narrow
face
with
eyes
of
a
very
light
grey
and
a
round
bulging
forehead
this
is
the
juge
asked
hanaud
yes
fleuriot
replied
louis
besnard
in
a
whisper
fleuriot
was
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
and
it
was
not
until
besnard
stepped
forward
noisily
on
the
gravel
that
he
became
aware
of
the
group
in
the
garden
this
is
hanaud
of
the
surete
in
paris
said
louis
besnard
fleuriot
bowed
with
cordiality
you
are
very
welcome
hanaud
you
will
find
that
nothing
at
the
villa
has
been
disturbed
the
moment
the
message
arrived
over
the
telephone
that
you
were
willing
to
assist
us
i
gave
instructions
that
all
should
be
left
as
we
found
it
i
trust
that
you
with
your
experience
will
see
a
way
where
our
eyes
find
none
hanaud
bowed
in
reply
i
shall
do
my
best
fleuriot
i
can
say
no
more
he
said
but
who
are
these
gentlemen
asked
fleuriot
waking
it
seemed
now
for
the
first
time
to
the
presence
of
harry
wethermill
and
ricardo
they
are
both
friends
of
mine
replied
hanaud
if
you
do
not
object
i
think
their
assistance
may
be
useful
wethermill
for
instance
was
acquainted
with
celia
harland
ah
cried
the
judge
and
his
face
took
on
suddenly
a
keen
and
eager
look
you
can
tell
me
about
her
perhaps
all
that
i
know
i
will
tell
readily
said
harry
wethermill
into
the
light
eyes
of
fleuriot
there
came
a
cold
bright
gleam
he
took
a
step
forward
his
face
seemed
to
narrow
to
a
greater
sharpness
in
a
moment
to
ricardo
thought
he
ceased
to
be
the
judge
he
dropped
from
his
high
office
he
dwindled
into
a
fanatic
she
is
a
jewess
this
celia
harland
he
cried
no
fleuriot
she
is
not
replied
wethermill
i
do
not
speak
in
disparagement
of
that
race
for
i
count
many
friends
amongst
its
members
but
celia
harland
is
not
one
of
them
ah
said
fleuriot
and
there
was
something
of
disappointment
something
too
of
incredulity
in
his
voice
well
you
will
come
and
report
to
me
when
you
have
made
your
investigation
and
he
passed
on
without
another
question
or
remark
the
group
of
men
watched
him
go
and
it
was
not
until
he
was
out
of
earshot
that
besnard
turned
with
a
deprecating
gesture
to
hanaud
yes
yes
he
is
a
good
judge
hanaud
quick
discriminating
sympathetic
but
he
has
that
bee
in
his
bonnet
like
so
many
others
everywhere
he
must
see
dreyfus
he
can
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
no
matter
how
insignificant
a
woman
is
murdered
she
must
have
letters
in
her
possession
which
would
convict
dreyfus
but
you
know
there
are
thousands
like
that
good
kindly
just
people
in
the
ordinary
ways
of
life
but
behind
every
crime
they
see
the
jew
hanaud
nodded
his
head
i
know
and
in
a
juge
it
is
very
embarrassing
let
us
walk
on
between
the
gate
and
the
villa
a
second
struck
off
to
the
left
and
at
the
entrance
to
it
stood
a
young
stout
man
in
black
leggings
the
chauffeur
asked
hanaud
i
will
speak
to
him
the
commissaire
called
the
chauffeur
forward
servettaz
he
said
you
will
answer
any
questions
which
monsieur
may
put
to
you
certainly
le
commissaire
said
the
chauffeur
his
manner
was
serious
but
he
answered
readily
there
was
no
sign
of
fear
upon
his
face
how
long
have
you
been
with
mme
dauvray
hanaud
asked
four
months
monsieur
i
drove
her
to
aix
from
paris
and
since
your
parents
live
at
chambery
you
wished
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
spending
a
day
with
them
while
you
were
so
near
yes
monsieur
when
did
you
ask
for
permission
on
saturday
monsieur
did
you
ask
particularly
that
you
should
have
yesterday
the
tuesday
no
monsieur
i
asked
only
for
a
day
whenever
it
should
be
convenient
to
madame
quite
so
said
hanaud
now
when
did
mme
dauvray
tell
you
that
you
might
have
tuesday
servettaz
hesitated
his
face
became
troubled
when
he
spoke
he
spoke
reluctantly
it
was
not
mme
dauvray
monsieur
who
told
me
that
i
might
go
on
tuesday
he
said
not
mme
dauvray
who
was
it
then
hanaud
asked
sharply
servettaz
glanced
from
one
to
another
of
the
grave
faces
which
confronted
him
it
was
mlle
celie
he
said
who
told
me
oh
said
hanaud
slowly
it
was
mlle
celie
when
did
she
tell
you
on
monday
morning
monsieur
i
was
cleaning
the
car
she
came
to
the
garage
with
some
flowers
in
her
hand
which
she
had
been
cutting
in
the
garden
and
she
said
was
right
alphonse
madame
has
a
kind
heart
you
can
go
by
the
train
which
leaves
aix
at
and
arrives
at
chambery
at
nine
minutes
after
two
hanaud
started
was
right
alphonse
were
those
her
words
and
has
a
kind
heart
come
come
what
is
all
this
he
lifted
a
warning
finger
and
said
gravely
be
very
careful
servettaz
those
were
her
words
monsieur
was
right
alphonse
madame
has
a
kind
heart
yes
monsieur
then
mlle
celie
had
spoken
to
you
before
about
this
visit
of
yours
to
chambery
said
hanaud
with
his
eyes
fixed
steadily
upon
the
chauffeur
face
the
distress
upon
servettaz
face
increased
suddenly
hanaud
voice
rang
sharply
you
hesitate
begin
at
the
beginning
speak
the
truth
servettaz
monsieur
i
am
speaking
the
truth
said
the
chauffeur
it
is
true
i
hesitate
i
have
heard
this
morning
what
people
are
saying
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
mlle
celie
was
always
kind
and
thoughtful
for
me
but
it
is
true
and
with
a
kind
of
desperation
he
went
on
yes
it
is
true
that
it
was
mlle
celie
who
first
suggested
to
me
that
i
should
ask
for
a
day
to
go
to
chambery
when
did
she
suggest
it
on
the
saturday
to
ricardo
the
words
were
startling
he
glanced
with
pity
towards
wethermill
wethermill
however
had
made
up
his
mind
for
good
and
all
he
stood
with
a
dogged
look
upon
his
face
his
chin
thrust
forward
his
eyes
upon
the
chauffeur
besnard
the
commissaire
had
made
up
his
mind
too
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
hanaud
stepped
forward
and
laid
his
hand
gently
on
the
chauffeur
arm
come
my
friend
he
said
let
us
hear
exactly
how
this
happened
mlle
celie
said
servettaz
with
genuine
compunction
in
his
voice
came
to
the
garage
on
saturday
morning
and
ordered
the
car
for
the
afternoon
she
stayed
and
talked
to
me
for
a
little
while
as
she
often
did
she
said
that
she
had
been
told
that
my
parents
lived
at
chambery
and
since
i
was
so
near
i
ought
to
ask
for
a
holiday
for
it
would
not
be
kind
if
i
did
not
go
and
see
them
that
was
all
yes
monsieur
very
well
and
the
detective
resumed
at
once
his
brisk
voice
and
alert
manner
he
seemed
to
dismiss
servettaz
admission
from
his
mind
ricardo
had
the
impression
of
a
man
tying
up
an
important
document
which
for
the
moment
he
has
done
with
and
putting
it
away
ticketed
in
some
in
his
desk
let
us
see
the
garage
they
followed
the
road
between
the
bushes
until
a
turn
showed
them
the
garage
with
its
doors
open
the
doors
were
found
unlocked
just
as
you
see
them
hanaud
nodded
he
spoke
again
to
servettaz
what
did
you
do
with
the
key
on
tuesday
i
gave
it
to
helene
vauquier
monsieur
after
i
had
locked
up
the
garage
and
she
hung
it
on
a
nail
in
the
kitchen
i
see
said
hanaud
so
any
one
could
easily
have
found
it
last
night
yes
monsieur
if
one
knew
where
to
look
for
it
at
the
back
of
the
garage
a
row
of
stood
against
the
brick
wall
was
any
petrol
taken
asked
hanaud
yes
monsieur
there
was
very
little
petrol
in
the
car
when
i
went
away
more
was
taken
but
it
was
taken
from
the
middle
tins
these
and
he
touched
the
tins
i
see
said
hanaud
and
he
raised
his
eyebrows
thoughtfully
the
commissaire
moved
with
impatience
from
the
middle
or
from
the
end
what
does
it
matter
he
exclaimed
the
petrol
was
taken
hanaud
however
did
not
dismiss
the
point
so
lightly
but
it
is
very
possible
that
it
does
matter
he
said
gently
for
example
if
servettaz
had
had
no
reason
to
examine
his
tins
it
might
have
been
some
while
before
he
found
out
that
the
petrol
had
been
taken
indeed
yes
said
servettaz
i
might
even
have
forgotten
that
i
had
not
used
it
myself
quite
so
said
hanaud
and
he
turned
to
besnard
i
think
that
may
be
important
i
do
not
know
he
said
but
since
the
car
is
gone
cried
besnard
how
could
the
chauffeur
not
look
immediately
at
his
tins
the
question
had
occurred
to
ricardo
and
he
wondered
in
what
way
hanaud
meant
to
answer
it
hanaud
however
did
not
mean
to
answer
it
he
took
little
notice
of
it
at
all
he
put
it
aside
with
a
superb
indifference
to
the
opinion
which
his
companions
might
form
of
him
ah
yes
he
said
carelessly
since
the
car
is
gone
as
you
say
that
is
so
and
he
turned
again
to
servettaz
it
was
a
powerful
car
he
asked
sixty
said
servettaz
hanaud
turned
to
the
commissaire
you
have
the
number
and
description
i
suppose
it
will
be
as
well
to
advertise
for
it
it
may
have
been
seen
it
must
be
somewhere
the
commissaire
replied
that
the
description
had
already
been
printed
and
hanaud
with
a
nod
of
approval
examined
the
ground
in
front
of
the
garage
there
was
a
small
stone
courtyard
but
on
its
surface
there
was
no
trace
of
a
footstep
yet
the
gravel
was
wet
he
said
shaking
his
head
the
man
who
fetched
that
car
fetched
it
carefully
he
turned
and
walked
back
with
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
then
he
ran
to
the
grass
border
between
the
gravel
and
the
bushes
look
he
said
to
wethermill
a
foot
has
pressed
the
blades
of
grass
down
here
but
very
lightly
yes
and
there
again
some
one
ran
along
the
border
here
on
his
toes
yes
he
was
very
careful
they
turned
again
into
the
main
drive
and
following
it
for
a
few
yards
came
suddenly
upon
a
space
in
front
of
the
villa
it
was
a
small
toy
looking
on
to
a
green
lawn
gay
with
it
was
built
of
yellow
stone
and
was
almost
square
in
shape
a
couple
of
ornate
pillars
flanked
the
door
and
a
gable
roof
topped
by
a
gilt
vane
surmounted
it
to
ricardo
it
seemed
impossible
that
so
sordid
and
sinister
a
tragedy
had
taken
place
within
its
walls
during
the
last
twelve
hours
it
glistened
so
gaudily
in
the
blaze
of
sunlight
here
and
there
the
green
outer
shutters
were
closed
here
and
there
the
windows
stood
open
to
let
in
the
air
and
light
upon
each
side
of
the
door
there
was
a
window
lighting
the
hall
which
was
large
beyond
those
windows
again
on
each
side
there
were
glass
doors
opening
to
the
ground
and
protected
by
the
ordinary
green
latticed
shutters
of
wood
which
now
stood
hooked
back
against
the
wall
these
glass
doors
opened
into
rooms
oblong
in
shape
which
ran
through
towards
the
back
of
the
house
and
were
lighted
in
addition
by
side
windows
the
room
upon
the
extreme
left
as
the
party
faced
the
villa
was
the
with
the
kitchen
at
the
back
the
room
on
the
right
was
the
salon
in
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
in
front
of
the
glass
door
to
this
room
a
strip
of
what
had
once
been
grass
stretched
to
the
gravel
drive
but
the
grass
had
been
worn
away
by
constant
use
and
the
black
mould
showed
through
this
strip
was
about
three
yards
wide
and
as
they
approached
they
saw
even
at
a
distance
that
since
the
rain
of
last
night
it
had
been
trampled
down
we
will
go
round
the
house
first
said
hanaud
and
he
turned
along
the
side
of
the
villa
and
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
road
there
were
four
windows
just
above
his
head
of
which
three
lighted
the
salon
and
the
fourth
a
small
behind
it
under
these
windows
there
was
no
disturbance
of
the
ground
and
a
careful
investigation
showed
conclusively
that
the
only
entrance
used
had
been
the
glass
doors
of
the
salon
facing
the
drive
to
that
spot
then
they
returned
there
were
three
sets
of
footmarks
upon
the
soil
one
set
ran
in
a
distinct
curve
from
the
drive
to
the
side
of
the
door
and
did
not
cross
the
others
those
said
hanaud
are
the
footsteps
of
my
intelligent
friend
perrichet
who
was
careful
not
to
disturb
the
ground
perrichet
beamed
all
over
his
rosy
face
and
besnard
nodded
at
him
with
condescending
approval
but
i
wish
le
commissaire
and
hanaud
pointed
to
a
blur
of
marks
that
your
other
officers
had
been
as
intelligent
look
these
run
from
the
glass
door
to
the
drive
and
for
all
the
use
they
are
to
us
a
harrow
might
have
been
dragged
across
them
besnard
drew
himself
up
not
one
of
my
officers
has
entered
the
room
by
way
of
this
door
the
strictest
orders
were
given
and
obeyed
the
ground
as
you
see
it
is
the
ground
as
it
was
at
twelve
last
night
hanaud
face
grew
thoughtful
is
that
so
he
said
and
he
stooped
to
examine
the
second
set
of
marks
they
were
at
the
righthand
side
of
the
door
a
woman
and
a
man
he
said
but
they
are
mere
hints
rather
than
prints
one
might
almost
think
he
rose
up
without
finishing
his
sentence
and
he
turned
to
the
third
set
and
a
look
of
satisfaction
gleamed
upon
his
face
ah
here
is
something
more
interesting
he
said
there
were
just
three
impressions
and
whereas
the
blurred
marks
were
at
the
side
these
three
pointed
straight
from
the
middle
of
the
glass
doors
to
the
drive
they
were
quite
clearly
defined
and
all
three
were
the
impressions
made
by
a
woman
small
arched
shoe
the
position
of
the
marks
was
at
first
sight
a
little
peculiar
there
was
one
a
good
yard
from
the
window
the
impression
of
the
right
foot
and
the
pressure
of
the
sole
of
the
shoe
was
more
marked
than
that
of
the
heel
the
second
the
impression
of
the
left
foot
was
not
quite
so
far
from
the
first
as
the
first
was
from
the
window
and
here
again
the
heel
was
the
more
lightly
defined
but
there
was
this
difference
the
mark
of
the
toe
which
was
pointed
in
the
first
instance
was
in
this
broader
and
a
trifle
blurred
close
beside
it
the
right
foot
was
again
visible
only
now
the
narrow
heel
was
more
clearly
defined
than
the
ball
of
the
foot
it
had
indeed
sunk
half
an
inch
into
the
soft
ground
there
were
no
further
imprints
indeed
these
two
were
not
merely
close
together
they
were
close
to
the
gravel
of
the
drive
and
on
the
very
border
of
the
grass
hanaud
looked
at
the
marks
thoughtfully
then
he
turned
to
the
commissaire
are
there
any
shoes
in
the
house
which
fit
those
marks
yes
we
have
tried
the
shoes
of
all
the
women
celie
harland
the
maid
and
even
mme
dauvray
the
only
ones
which
fit
at
all
are
those
taken
from
celie
harland
bedroom
he
called
to
an
officer
standing
in
the
drive
and
a
pair
of
grey
suede
shoes
were
brought
to
him
from
the
hall
see
hanaud
it
is
a
pretty
little
foot
which
made
those
clear
impressions
he
said
with
a
smile
a
foot
arched
and
slender
mme
dauvray
foot
is
short
and
square
the
maid
broad
and
flat
neither
mme
dauvray
nor
helene
vauquier
could
have
worn
these
shoes
they
were
lying
one
here
one
there
upon
the
floor
of
celie
harland
room
as
though
she
had
kicked
them
off
in
a
hurry
they
are
almost
new
you
see
they
have
been
worn
once
perhaps
no
more
and
they
fit
with
absolute
precision
into
those
footmarks
except
just
at
the
toe
of
that
second
one
hanaud
took
the
shoes
and
kneeling
down
placed
them
one
after
the
other
over
the
impressions
to
ricardo
it
was
extraordinary
how
exactly
they
covered
up
the
marks
and
filled
the
indentations
i
should
say
said
the
commissaire
that
celie
harland
went
away
wearing
a
new
pair
of
shoes
made
on
the
very
same
last
as
those
as
those
she
had
left
carelessly
lying
on
the
floor
of
her
room
for
the
first
person
to
notice
thought
ricardo
it
seemed
as
if
the
girl
had
gone
out
of
her
way
to
make
the
weight
of
evidence
against
her
as
heavy
as
possible
yet
after
all
it
was
just
through
inattention
to
the
small
details
so
insignificant
at
the
red
moment
of
crime
so
terribly
instructive
the
next
day
that
guilt
was
generally
brought
home
hanaud
rose
to
his
feet
and
handed
the
shoes
back
to
the
officer
yes
he
said
so
it
seems
the
shoemaker
can
help
us
here
i
see
the
shoes
were
made
in
aix
besnard
looked
at
the
name
stamped
in
gold
letters
upon
the
lining
of
the
shoes
i
will
have
inquiries
made
he
said
hanaud
nodded
took
a
measure
from
his
pocket
and
measured
the
ground
between
the
window
and
the
first
footstep
and
between
the
first
footstep
and
the
other
two
how
tall
is
mlle
celie
he
asked
and
he
addressed
the
question
to
wethermill
it
struck
ricardo
as
one
of
the
strangest
details
in
all
this
strange
affair
that
the
detective
should
ask
with
confidence
for
information
which
might
help
to
bring
celia
harland
to
the
guillotine
from
the
man
who
had
staked
his
happiness
upon
her
innocence
about
five
feet
seven
he
answered
hanaud
replaced
his
measure
in
his
pocket
he
turned
with
a
grave
face
to
wethermill
i
warned
you
fairly
did
i
he
said
wethermill
white
face
twitched
yes
he
said
i
am
not
afraid
but
there
was
more
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
than
there
had
been
before
hanaud
pointed
solemnly
to
the
ground
read
the
story
those
footprints
write
in
the
mould
there
a
young
and
active
girl
of
about
mlle
celie
height
and
wearing
a
new
pair
of
mlle
celie
shoes
springs
from
that
room
where
the
murder
was
committed
where
the
body
of
the
murdered
woman
lies
she
is
running
she
is
wearing
a
long
gown
at
the
second
step
the
hem
of
the
gown
catches
beneath
the
point
of
her
shoe
she
stumbles
to
save
herself
from
falling
she
brings
up
the
other
foot
sharply
and
stamps
the
heel
down
into
the
ground
she
recovers
her
balance
she
steps
on
to
the
drive
it
is
true
the
gravel
here
is
hard
and
takes
no
mark
but
you
will
see
that
some
of
the
mould
which
has
clung
to
her
shoes
has
dropped
off
she
mounts
into
the
with
the
man
and
the
other
woman
and
drives
off
some
time
between
eleven
and
twelve
between
eleven
and
twelve
is
that
sure
asked
besnard
certainly
replied
hanaud
the
gate
is
open
at
eleven
and
perrichet
closes
it
it
is
open
again
at
twelve
therefore
the
murderers
had
not
gone
before
eleven
no
the
gate
was
open
for
them
to
go
but
they
had
not
gone
else
why
should
the
gate
again
be
open
at
midnight
besnard
nodded
in
assent
and
suddenly
perrichet
started
forward
with
his
eyes
full
of
horror
then
when
i
first
closed
the
gate
he
cried
and
came
into
the
garden
and
up
to
the
house
they
were
here
in
that
room
oh
my
god
he
stared
at
the
window
with
his
mouth
open
i
am
afraid
my
friend
that
is
so
said
hanaud
gravely
but
i
knocked
upon
the
wooden
door
i
tried
the
bolts
and
they
were
within
in
the
darkness
within
holding
their
breath
not
three
yards
from
me
he
stood
transfixed
that
we
shall
see
said
hanaud
he
stepped
in
perrichet
footsteps
to
the
sill
of
the
room
he
examined
the
green
wooden
doors
which
opened
outwards
and
the
glass
doors
which
opened
inwards
taking
a
from
his
pocket
he
called
besnard
to
his
side
see
he
said
pointing
to
the
woodwork
asked
besnard
eagerly
yes
of
hands
in
gloves
returned
hanaud
we
shall
learn
nothing
from
these
marks
except
that
the
assassins
knew
their
trade
then
he
stooped
down
to
the
sill
where
some
traces
of
steps
were
visible
he
rose
with
a
gesture
of
resignation
rubber
shoes
he
said
and
so
stepped
into
the
room
followed
by
wethermill
and
the
others
they
found
themselves
in
a
small
recess
which
was
panelled
with
wood
painted
white
and
here
and
there
delicately
carved
into
festoons
of
flowers
the
recess
ended
in
an
arch
supported
by
two
slender
pillars
and
on
the
inner
side
of
the
arch
thick
curtains
of
pink
silk
were
hung
these
were
drawn
back
carelessly
and
through
the
opening
between
them
the
party
looked
down
the
length
of
the
room
beyond
they
passed
within
chapter
v
in
the
salon
julius
ricardo
pushed
aside
the
curtains
with
a
thrill
of
excitement
he
found
himself
standing
within
a
small
oblong
room
which
was
prettily
even
daintily
furnished
on
his
left
close
by
the
recess
was
a
small
fireplace
with
the
ashes
of
a
fire
in
the
grate
beyond
the
grate
a
long
settee
covered
in
pink
damask
with
a
crumpled
cushion
at
each
end
stood
a
foot
or
two
away
from
the
wall
and
beyond
the
settee
the
door
of
the
room
opened
into
the
hall
at
the
end
a
long
mirror
was
let
into
the
panelling
and
a
stood
by
the
mirror
on
the
right
were
the
three
windows
and
between
the
two
nearest
to
ricardo
was
the
switch
of
the
electric
light
a
chandelier
hung
from
the
ceiling
an
electric
lamp
stood
upon
the
a
couple
of
electric
candles
on
the
a
round
satinwood
table
stood
under
the
windows
with
three
chairs
about
it
of
which
one
was
overturned
one
was
placed
with
its
back
to
the
electric
switch
and
the
third
on
the
opposite
side
facing
it
ricardo
could
hardly
believe
that
he
stood
actually
upon
the
spot
where
within
twelve
hours
a
cruel
and
sinister
tragedy
had
taken
place
there
was
so
little
disorder
the
three
windows
on
his
right
showed
him
the
blue
sunlit
sky
and
a
glimpse
of
flowers
and
trees
behind
him
the
glass
doors
stood
open
to
the
lawn
where
birds
piped
cheerfully
and
the
trees
murmured
of
summer
but
he
saw
hanaud
stepping
quickly
from
place
to
place
with
an
extraordinary
lightness
of
step
for
so
big
a
man
obviously
engrossed
obviously
reading
here
and
there
some
detail
some
custom
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
room
ricardo
leaned
with
careful
artistry
against
the
wall
now
what
has
this
room
to
say
to
me
he
asked
importantly
nobody
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
his
question
and
it
was
just
as
well
for
the
room
had
very
little
information
to
give
him
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
white
louis
seize
furniture
the
white
panels
of
the
wall
the
polished
floor
the
pink
curtains
even
the
delicate
tracery
of
the
ceiling
did
not
escape
his
scrutiny
yet
he
saw
nothing
likely
to
help
him
but
an
overturned
chair
and
a
couple
of
crushed
cushions
on
a
settee
it
was
very
annoying
all
the
more
annoying
because
hanaud
was
so
uncommonly
busy
hanaud
looked
carefully
at
the
long
settee
and
the
crumpled
cushions
and
he
took
out
his
measure
and
measured
the
distance
between
the
cushion
at
one
end
and
the
cushion
at
the
other
he
examined
the
table
he
measured
the
distance
between
the
chairs
he
came
to
the
fireplace
and
raked
in
the
ashes
of
the
fire
but
ricardo
noticed
a
singular
thing
in
the
midst
of
his
search
eyes
were
always
straying
back
to
the
settee
and
always
with
a
look
of
extreme
perplexity
as
if
he
read
there
something
definitely
something
but
something
which
he
could
not
explain
finally
he
went
back
to
it
he
drew
it
farther
away
from
the
wall
and
suddenly
with
a
little
cry
he
stooped
and
went
down
on
his
knees
when
he
rose
he
was
holding
some
torn
fragments
of
paper
in
his
hand
he
went
over
to
the
and
opened
the
where
it
fell
open
there
were
some
sheets
of
and
one
particular
sheet
of
which
half
had
been
torn
off
he
compared
the
pieces
which
he
held
with
that
torn
sheet
and
seemed
satisfied
there
was
a
rack
for
upon
the
table
and
from
it
he
took
a
stiff
card
get
me
some
gum
or
paste
and
quickly
he
said
his
voice
had
become
brusque
the
politeness
had
gone
from
his
address
he
carried
the
card
and
the
fragments
of
paper
to
the
round
table
there
he
sat
down
and
with
infinite
patience
gummed
the
fragments
on
to
the
card
fitting
them
together
like
the
pieces
of
a
chinese
puzzle
the
others
over
his
shoulders
could
see
spaced
words
written
in
pencil
taking
shape
as
a
sentence
upon
the
card
hanaud
turned
abruptly
in
his
seat
toward
wethermill
you
have
no
doubt
a
letter
written
by
mlle
celie
wethermill
took
his
from
his
pocket
and
a
letter
out
of
the
case
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
he
glanced
over
what
was
written
the
four
sheets
were
covered
he
folded
back
the
letter
so
that
only
the
two
inner
sheets
were
visible
and
handed
it
to
hanaud
hanaud
compared
it
with
the
handwriting
upon
the
card
look
he
said
at
length
and
the
three
men
gathered
behind
him
on
the
card
the
gummed
fragments
of
paper
revealed
a
sentence
je
ne
sais
pas
do
not
know
said
ricardo
now
this
is
very
important
beside
the
card
celia
letter
to
wethermill
was
laid
what
do
you
think
asked
hanaud
besnard
the
commissaire
of
police
bent
over
hanaud
shoulder
there
are
strong
resemblances
he
said
guardedly
ricardo
was
on
the
for
deep
mysteries
resemblances
were
not
enough
for
him
they
were
inadequate
to
the
artistic
needs
of
the
situation
both
were
written
by
the
same
hand
he
said
definitely
only
in
the
sentence
written
upon
the
card
the
handwriting
is
carefully
disguised
ah
said
the
commissaire
bending
forward
again
here
is
an
idea
yes
yes
there
are
strong
differences
ricardo
looked
triumphant
yes
there
are
differences
said
hanaud
look
how
long
the
up
stroke
of
the
is
how
it
wavers
see
how
suddenly
this
straggles
off
as
though
some
emotion
made
the
hand
shake
yet
this
and
touching
wethermill
letter
he
smiled
ruefully
this
is
where
the
emotion
should
have
affected
the
pen
he
looked
up
at
wethermill
face
and
then
said
quietly
you
have
given
us
no
opinion
monsieur
yet
your
opinion
should
be
the
most
valuable
of
all
were
these
two
papers
written
by
the
same
hand
i
do
not
know
answered
wethermill
and
i
too
cried
hanaud
in
a
sudden
exasperation
je
ne
sais
pas
i
do
not
know
it
may
be
her
hand
carelessly
counterfeited
it
may
be
her
hand
disguised
it
may
be
simply
that
she
wrote
in
a
hurry
with
her
gloves
on
it
may
have
been
written
some
time
ago
said
ricardo
encouraged
by
his
success
to
another
suggestion
no
that
is
the
one
thing
it
could
not
have
been
said
hanaud
look
round
the
room
was
there
ever
a
room
better
tended
find
me
a
little
pile
of
dust
in
any
one
corner
if
you
can
it
is
all
as
clean
as
a
plate
every
morning
except
this
one
morning
this
room
has
been
swept
and
polished
the
paper
was
written
and
torn
up
yesterday
he
enclosed
the
card
in
an
envelope
as
he
spoke
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
rose
and
crossed
again
to
the
settee
he
stood
at
the
side
of
it
with
his
hands
clutching
the
lapels
of
his
coat
and
his
face
gravely
troubled
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
for
himself
of
suspense
for
all
the
others
who
watched
him
he
stooped
suddenly
slowly
and
with
extraordinary
care
he
pushed
his
hands
under
the
and
lifted
it
up
gently
so
that
the
indentations
of
its
surface
might
not
be
disarranged
he
carried
it
over
to
the
light
of
the
open
window
the
cushion
was
covered
with
silk
and
as
he
held
it
to
the
sunlight
all
could
see
a
small
brown
stain
hanaud
took
his
from
his
pocket
and
bent
his
head
over
the
cushion
but
at
that
moment
careful
though
he
had
been
the
down
swelled
up
within
the
cushion
the
folds
and
indentations
disappeared
the
silk
covering
was
stretched
smooth
oh
cried
besnard
tragically
what
have
you
done
hanaud
face
flushed
he
had
been
guilty
of
a
clumsiness
even
he
ricardo
took
up
the
tale
yes
he
exclaimed
what
have
you
done
hanaud
looked
at
ricardo
in
amazement
at
his
audacity
well
what
have
i
done
he
asked
come
tell
me
you
have
destroyed
a
clue
replied
ricardo
impressively
the
deepest
dejection
at
once
overspread
hanaud
burly
face
do
say
that
ricardo
i
beseech
you
he
implored
a
clue
and
i
have
destroyed
it
but
what
kind
of
a
clue
and
how
have
i
destroyed
it
and
to
what
mystery
would
it
be
a
clue
if
i
had
destroyed
it
and
what
will
become
of
me
when
i
go
back
to
paris
and
say
in
the
rue
de
jerusalem
me
sweep
the
cellars
my
good
friends
for
ricardo
knows
that
i
destroyed
a
clue
faithfully
he
promised
me
that
he
would
not
open
his
mouth
but
i
destroyed
a
clue
and
his
perspicacity
forced
him
into
speech
it
was
the
turn
of
ricardo
to
grow
red
hanaud
turned
with
a
smile
to
besnard
it
does
not
really
matter
whether
the
creases
in
this
cushion
remain
he
said
we
have
all
seen
them
and
he
replaced
the
glass
in
his
pocket
he
carried
that
cushion
back
and
replaced
it
then
he
took
the
other
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
settee
and
carried
it
in
its
turn
to
the
window
this
was
indented
too
and
ridged
up
and
just
at
the
marks
the
nap
of
the
silk
was
worn
and
there
was
a
slit
where
it
had
been
cut
the
perplexity
upon
hanaud
face
greatly
increased
he
stood
with
the
cushion
in
his
hands
no
longer
looking
at
it
but
looking
out
through
the
doors
at
the
footsteps
so
clearly
defined
the
of
a
girl
who
had
run
from
this
room
and
sprung
into
a
and
driven
away
he
shook
his
head
and
carrying
back
the
cushion
laid
it
carefully
down
then
he
stood
erect
gazed
about
the
room
as
though
even
yet
he
might
force
its
secrets
out
from
its
silence
and
cried
with
a
sudden
violence
there
is
something
here
gentlemen
which
i
do
not
understand
ricardo
heard
some
one
beside
him
draw
a
deep
breath
and
turned
wethermill
stood
at
his
elbow
a
faint
colour
had
come
back
to
his
cheeks
his
eyes
were
fixed
intently
upon
hanaud
face
what
do
you
think
he
asked
and
hanaud
replied
brusquely
it
not
my
business
to
hold
opinions
monsieur
my
business
is
to
make
sure
there
was
one
point
and
only
one
of
which
he
had
made
every
one
in
that
room
sure
he
had
started
confident
here
was
a
sordid
crime
easily
understood
but
in
that
room
he
had
read
something
which
had
troubled
him
which
had
raised
the
sordid
crime
on
to
some
higher
and
perplexing
level
then
fleuriot
after
all
might
be
right
asked
the
commissaire
timidly
hanaud
stared
at
him
for
a
second
then
smiled
dreyfus
he
cried
oh
la
la
la
no
but
there
is
something
else
what
was
that
something
ricardo
asked
himself
he
looked
once
more
about
the
room
he
did
not
find
his
answer
but
he
caught
sight
of
an
ornament
upon
the
wall
which
drove
the
question
from
his
mind
the
ornament
if
so
it
could
be
called
was
a
painted
tambourine
with
a
bunch
of
bright
ribbons
tied
to
the
rim
and
it
was
hung
upon
the
wall
between
the
settee
and
the
fireplace
at
about
the
height
of
a
head
of
course
it
might
be
no
more
than
it
seemed
to
be
a
rather
gaudy
and
vulgar
toy
such
as
a
woman
like
mme
dauvray
would
be
very
likely
to
choose
in
order
to
dress
her
walls
but
it
swept
thoughts
back
of
a
sudden
to
the
at
leamington
and
the
apparatus
of
a
spiritualistic
show
after
all
he
reflected
triumphantly
hanaud
had
not
noticed
everything
and
as
he
made
the
reflection
hanaud
voice
broke
in
to
corroborate
him
we
have
seen
everything
here
let
us
go
upstairs
he
said
we
will
first
visit
the
room
of
mlle
celie
then
we
will
question
the
maid
helene
vauquier
the
four
men
followed
by
perrichet
passed
out
by
the
door
into
the
hall
and
mounted
the
stairs
celia
room
was
in
the
southwest
angle
of
the
villa
a
bright
and
airy
room
of
which
one
window
overlooked
the
road
and
two
others
between
which
stood
the
the
garden
behind
the
room
a
door
led
into
a
little
bathroom
some
towels
were
tumbled
upon
the
floor
beside
the
bath
in
the
bedroom
a
frock
of
tussore
and
a
petticoat
were
flung
carelessly
on
the
bed
a
big
grey
hat
of
ottoman
silk
was
lying
upon
a
chest
of
drawers
in
the
recess
of
a
window
and
upon
a
chair
a
little
pile
of
fine
linen
and
a
pair
of
grey
silk
stockings
which
matched
in
shade
the
grey
suede
shoes
were
tossed
in
a
heap
it
was
here
that
you
saw
the
light
at
nine
hanaud
said
turning
to
perrichet
yes
monsieur
replied
perrichet
we
may
assume
then
that
mlle
celie
was
changing
her
dress
at
that
time
besnard
was
looking
about
him
opening
a
drawer
here
a
wardrobe
there
mlle
celie
he
said
with
a
laugh
was
a
particular
young
lady
and
fond
of
her
fine
clothes
if
one
may
judge
from
the
room
and
the
order
of
the
cupboards
she
must
have
changed
her
dress
last
night
in
an
unusual
hurry
there
was
about
the
whole
room
a
certain
daintiness
almost
it
seemed
to
ricardo
a
fragrance
as
though
the
girl
had
impressed
something
of
her
own
delicate
self
upon
it
wethermill
stood
upon
the
threshold
watching
with
a
sullen
face
the
violation
of
this
chamber
by
the
officers
of
the
police
no
such
feelings
however
troubled
hanaud
he
went
over
to
the
and
opened
a
few
small
leather
cases
which
held
ornaments
in
one
or
two
of
them
a
trinket
was
visible
others
were
empty
one
of
these
latter
hanaud
held
open
in
his
hand
and
for
so
long
that
besnard
moved
impatiently
you
see
it
is
empty
monsieur
he
said
and
suddenly
wethermill
moved
forward
into
the
room
yes
i
see
that
said
hanaud
dryly
it
was
a
case
made
to
hold
a
couple
of
long
those
diamond
doubtless
which
ricardo
had
seen
twinkling
in
the
garden
will
monsieur
let
me
see
asked
wethermill
and
he
took
the
case
in
his
hands
yes
he
said
mlle
celie
and
he
handed
the
case
back
with
a
thoughtful
air
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
taken
a
definite
part
in
the
investigation
to
ricardo
the
reason
was
clear
harry
wethermill
had
himself
given
those
to
celia
hanaud
replaced
the
case
and
turned
round
there
is
nothing
more
for
us
to
see
here
he
said
i
suppose
that
no
one
has
been
allowed
to
enter
the
room
and
he
opened
the
door
no
one
except
helene
vauquier
replied
the
commissaire
ricardo
felt
indignant
at
so
obvious
a
piece
of
carelessness
even
wethermill
looked
surprised
hanaud
merely
shut
the
door
again
oho
the
maid
he
said
then
she
has
recovered
she
is
still
weak
said
the
commissaire
but
i
thought
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
obtain
at
once
a
description
of
what
celie
harland
wore
when
she
left
the
house
i
spoke
to
fleuriot
about
it
and
he
gave
me
permission
to
bring
helene
vauquier
here
who
alone
could
tell
us
i
brought
her
here
myself
just
before
you
came
she
looked
through
the
girl
wardrobe
to
see
what
was
missing
was
she
alone
in
the
room
not
for
a
moment
said
besnard
haughtily
really
monsieur
we
are
not
so
ignorant
of
how
an
affair
of
this
kind
should
be
conducted
i
was
in
the
room
myself
the
whole
time
with
my
eye
upon
her
that
was
just
before
i
came
said
hanaud
he
crossed
carelessly
to
the
open
window
which
overlooked
the
road
and
leaning
out
of
it
looked
up
the
road
to
the
corner
round
which
he
and
his
friends
had
come
precisely
as
the
commissaire
had
done
then
he
turned
back
into
the
room
which
was
the
last
cupboard
or
drawer
that
helene
vauquier
touched
he
asked
this
one
besnard
stooped
and
pulled
open
the
bottom
drawer
of
a
chest
which
stood
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
a
dress
was
lying
at
the
bottom
i
told
her
to
be
quick
said
besnard
since
i
had
seen
that
you
were
coming
she
lifted
this
dress
out
and
said
that
nothing
was
missing
there
so
i
took
her
back
to
her
room
and
left
her
with
the
nurse
hanaud
lifted
the
light
dress
from
the
drawer
shook
it
out
in
front
of
the
window
twirled
it
round
snatched
up
a
corner
of
it
and
held
it
to
his
eyes
and
then
folding
it
quickly
replaced
it
in
the
drawer
now
show
me
the
first
drawer
she
touched
and
this
time
he
lifted
out
a
petticoat
and
taking
it
to
the
window
examined
it
with
a
greater
care
when
he
had
finished
with
it
he
handed
it
to
ricardo
to
put
away
and
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
thoughtful
and
absorbed
ricardo
in
his
turn
examined
the
petticoat
but
he
could
see
nothing
unusual
it
was
an
attractive
petticoat
dainty
with
frills
and
lace
but
it
was
hardly
a
thing
to
grow
thoughtful
over
he
looked
up
in
perplexity
and
saw
that
hanaud
was
watching
his
investigations
with
a
smile
of
amusement
when
ricardo
has
put
that
away
he
said
we
will
hear
what
helene
vauquier
has
to
tell
us
he
passed
out
of
the
door
last
and
locking
it
placed
the
key
in
his
pocket
helene
vauquier
room
is
i
think
upstairs
he
said
and
he
moved
towards
the
staircase
but
as
he
did
so
a
man
in
plain
clothes
who
had
been
waiting
upon
the
landing
stepped
forward
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
piece
of
thin
strong
whipcord
ah
durette
cried
besnard
monsieur
hanaud
i
sent
durette
this
morning
round
the
shops
of
aix
with
the
cord
which
was
found
knotted
round
mme
dauvray
neck
hanaud
advanced
quickly
to
the
man
well
did
you
discover
anything
yes
monsieur
said
durette
at
the
shop
of
corval
in
the
rue
du
casino
a
young
lady
in
a
frock
and
hat
bought
some
cord
of
this
kind
at
a
few
minutes
after
nine
last
night
it
was
just
as
the
shop
was
being
closed
i
showed
corval
the
photograph
of
celie
harland
which
le
commissaire
gave
me
out
of
mme
dauvray
room
and
he
identified
it
as
the
portrait
of
the
girl
who
had
bought
the
cord
complete
silence
followed
upon
durette
words
the
whole
party
stood
like
men
stupefied
no
one
looked
towards
wethermill
even
hanaud
averted
his
eyes
yes
that
is
very
important
he
said
awkwardly
he
turned
away
and
followed
by
the
others
went
up
the
stairs
to
the
bedroom
of
helene
vauquier
chapter
vi
helene
vauquier
evidence
a
nurse
opened
the
door
within
the
room
helene
vauquier
was
leaning
back
in
a
chair
she
looked
ill
and
her
face
was
very
white
on
the
appearance
of
hanaud
the
commissaire
and
the
others
however
she
rose
to
her
feet
ricardo
recognised
the
justice
of
description
she
stood
before
them
a
tall
woman
of
or
forty
in
a
neat
black
stuff
dress
strong
with
the
strength
of
a
peasant
respectable
reliable
she
looked
what
she
had
been
the
confidential
maid
of
an
elderly
woman
on
her
face
there
was
now
an
aspect
of
eager
appeal
oh
monsieur
she
began
let
me
go
from
here
anywhere
into
prison
if
you
like
but
to
stay
here
where
in
years
past
we
were
so
happy
and
with
madame
lying
in
the
room
below
no
it
is
insupportable
she
sank
into
her
chair
and
hanaud
came
over
to
her
side
yes
yes
he
said
in
a
soothing
voice
i
can
understand
your
feelings
my
poor
woman
we
will
not
keep
you
here
you
have
perhaps
friends
in
aix
with
whom
you
could
stay
oh
yes
monsieur
helene
cried
gratefully
oh
but
i
thank
you
that
i
should
have
to
sleep
here
oh
how
the
fear
of
that
has
frightened
me
you
need
have
had
no
such
fear
after
all
we
are
not
the
visitors
of
last
night
said
hanaud
drawing
a
chair
close
to
her
and
patting
her
hand
sympathetically
now
i
want
you
to
tell
these
gentlemen
and
myself
all
that
you
know
of
this
dreadful
business
take
your
time
mademoiselle
we
are
human
but
monsieur
i
know
nothing
she
cried
i
was
told
that
i
might
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
had
dressed
mlle
celie
for
the
seance
seance
cried
ricardo
startled
into
speech
the
picture
of
the
assembly
hall
at
leamington
was
again
before
his
mind
but
hanaud
turned
towards
him
and
though
hanaud
face
retained
its
benevolent
expression
there
was
a
glitter
in
his
eyes
which
sent
the
blood
into
ricardo
face
did
you
speak
again
m
ricardo
the
detective
asked
no
i
thought
it
was
not
possible
he
turned
back
to
helene
vauquier
so
mlle
celie
practised
seances
that
is
very
strange
we
will
hear
about
them
who
knows
what
thread
may
lead
us
to
the
truth
helene
vauquier
shook
her
head
monsieur
it
is
not
right
that
you
should
seek
the
truth
from
me
for
consider
this
i
can
not
speak
with
justice
of
mlle
celie
no
i
can
not
i
did
not
like
her
i
was
jealous
yes
jealous
monsieur
you
want
the
truth
i
hated
her
and
the
woman
face
flushed
and
she
clenched
her
hand
upon
the
arm
of
her
chair
yes
i
hated
her
how
could
i
help
it
she
asked
why
asked
hanaud
gently
why
could
you
not
help
it
helene
vauquier
leaned
back
again
her
strength
exhausted
and
smiled
languidly
i
will
tell
you
but
remember
it
is
a
woman
speaking
to
you
and
things
which
you
will
count
silly
and
trivial
mean
very
much
to
her
there
was
one
night
last
june
only
last
june
to
think
of
it
so
little
while
ago
there
was
no
mlle
celie
and
as
hanaud
raised
his
hand
she
said
hurriedly
yes
yes
i
will
control
myself
but
to
think
of
mme
dauvray
now
and
thereupon
she
blurted
out
her
story
and
explained
to
ricardo
the
question
which
had
so
perplexed
him
how
a
girl
of
so
much
distinction
as
celia
harland
came
to
be
living
with
a
woman
of
so
common
a
type
as
mme
dauvray
well
one
night
in
june
said
helene
vauquier
madame
went
with
a
party
to
supper
at
the
abbaye
restaurant
in
montmartre
and
she
brought
home
for
the
first
time
mlle
celie
but
you
should
have
seen
her
she
had
on
a
little
plaid
skirt
and
a
coat
which
was
falling
to
pieces
and
she
was
starving
yes
starving
madame
told
me
the
story
that
night
as
i
undressed
her
mlle
celie
was
there
dancing
amidst
the
tables
for
a
supper
with
any
one
who
would
be
kind
enough
to
dance
with
her
the
scorn
of
her
voice
rang
through
the
room
she
was
the
rigid
respectable
peasant
woman
speaking
out
her
contempt
and
wethermill
must
needs
listen
to
it
ricardo
dared
not
glance
at
him
but
hardly
any
one
would
dance
with
her
in
her
rags
and
no
one
would
give
her
supper
except
madame
madame
did
madame
listened
to
her
story
of
hunger
and
distress
madame
believed
it
and
brought
her
home
madame
was
so
kind
so
careless
in
her
kindness
and
now
she
lies
murdered
for
a
reward
an
hysterical
sob
checked
the
utterances
her
face
began
to
work
her
hands
to
twitch
come
come
said
hanaud
gently
calm
yourself
mademoiselle
helene
vauquier
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
to
recover
her
composure
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
but
i
have
been
so
long
with
madame
oh
the
poor
woman
yes
yes
i
will
calm
myself
well
madame
brought
her
home
and
in
a
week
there
was
nothing
too
good
for
mlle
celie
madame
was
like
a
child
always
she
was
being
deceived
and
imposed
upon
never
she
learnt
prudence
but
no
one
so
quickly
made
her
way
to
heart
as
mlle
celie
mademoiselle
must
live
with
her
mademoiselle
must
be
dressed
by
the
first
modistes
mademoiselle
must
have
lace
petticoats
and
the
softest
linen
long
white
gloves
and
pretty
ribbons
for
her
hair
and
hats
from
caroline
reboux
at
twelve
hundred
francs
and
madame
maid
must
attend
upon
her
and
deck
her
out
in
all
these
dainty
things
bah
vauquier
was
sitting
erect
in
her
chair
violent
almost
rancorous
with
anger
she
looked
round
upon
the
company
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
told
you
not
to
come
to
me
she
said
i
can
not
speak
impartially
or
even
gently
of
mademoiselle
consider
for
years
i
had
been
more
than
madame
maid
her
friend
yes
so
she
was
kind
enough
to
call
me
she
talked
to
me
about
everything
consulted
me
about
everything
took
me
with
her
everywhere
then
she
brings
home
at
two
in
the
morning
a
young
girl
with
a
fresh
pretty
face
from
a
montmartre
restaurant
and
in
a
week
i
am
nothing
at
all
oh
but
nothing
and
mademoiselle
is
queen
yes
it
is
quite
natural
said
hanaud
sympathetically
you
would
not
have
been
human
mademoiselle
if
you
had
not
felt
some
anger
but
tell
us
frankly
about
these
seances
how
did
they
begin
oh
monsieur
vauquier
answered
it
was
not
difficult
to
begin
them
mme
dauvray
had
a
passion
for
and
rogues
of
that
kind
any
one
with
a
pack
of
cards
and
some
nonsense
about
a
dangerous
woman
with
black
hair
or
a
man
with
a
limp
monsieur
knows
the
stories
they
string
together
in
dimly
lighted
rooms
to
deceive
the
credulous
any
one
could
make
a
harvest
out
of
madame
superstitions
but
monsieur
knows
the
type
indeed
i
do
said
hanaud
with
a
laugh
well
after
mademoiselle
had
been
with
us
three
weeks
she
said
to
me
one
morning
when
i
was
dressing
her
hair
that
it
was
a
pity
madame
was
always
running
round
the
that
she
herself
could
do
something
much
more
striking
and
impressive
and
that
if
only
i
would
help
her
we
could
rescue
madame
from
their
clutches
sir
i
did
not
think
what
power
i
was
putting
into
mlle
celie
hands
or
assuredly
i
would
have
refused
and
i
did
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
mlle
celie
so
for
once
i
consented
and
having
once
consented
i
could
never
afterwards
refuse
for
if
i
had
mademoiselle
would
have
made
some
fine
excuse
about
the
psychic
influence
not
being
en
rapport
and
meanwhile
would
have
had
me
sent
away
while
if
i
had
confessed
the
truth
to
madame
she
would
have
been
so
angry
that
i
had
been
a
party
to
tricking
her
that
again
i
would
have
lost
my
place
and
so
the
seances
went
on
yes
said
hanaud
i
understand
that
your
position
was
very
difficult
we
shall
not
i
think
and
he
turned
to
the
commissaire
confidently
for
corroboration
of
his
words
be
disposed
to
blame
you
certainly
not
said
the
commissaire
after
all
life
is
not
so
easy
thus
then
the
seances
began
said
hanaud
leaning
forward
with
a
keen
interest
this
is
a
strange
and
curious
story
you
are
telling
me
mlle
vauquier
now
how
were
they
conducted
how
did
you
assist
what
did
mlle
celie
do
rap
on
the
tables
in
the
dark
and
rattle
tambourines
like
that
one
with
the
knot
of
ribbons
which
hangs
upon
the
wall
of
the
salon
there
was
a
gentle
and
inviting
irony
in
hanaud
tone
ricardo
was
disappointed
hanaud
had
after
all
not
overlooked
the
tambourine
without
ricardo
reason
to
notice
it
he
had
none
the
less
observed
it
and
borne
it
in
his
memory
well
he
asked
oh
monsieur
the
tambourines
and
the
rapping
on
the
table
cried
helene
that
was
nothing
oh
but
nothing
at
all
mademoiselle
celie
would
make
spirits
appear
and
speak
really
and
she
was
never
caught
out
but
mlle
celie
must
have
been
a
remarkably
clever
girl
oh
she
was
of
an
address
which
was
surprising
sometimes
madame
and
i
were
alone
sometimes
there
were
others
whom
madame
in
her
pride
had
invited
for
she
was
very
proud
monsieur
that
her
companion
could
introduce
her
to
the
spirits
of
dead
people
but
never
was
mlle
celie
caught
out
she
told
me
that
for
many
years
even
when
quite
a
child
she
had
travelled
through
england
giving
these
exhibitions
oho
said
hanaud
and
he
turned
to
wethermill
did
you
know
that
he
asked
in
english
i
did
not
he
said
i
do
not
now
hanaud
shook
his
head
to
me
this
story
does
not
seem
invented
he
replied
and
then
he
spoke
again
in
french
to
helene
vauquier
well
continue
mademoiselle
assume
that
the
company
is
assembled
for
our
seance
then
mlle
celie
dressed
in
a
long
gown
of
black
velvet
which
set
off
her
white
arms
and
shoulders
well
oh
mademoiselle
did
not
forget
those
little
trifles
helene
vauquier
interrupted
her
story
with
a
return
of
her
bitterness
to
interpolate
mademoiselle
would
sail
into
the
room
with
her
velvet
train
flowing
behind
her
and
perhaps
for
a
little
while
she
would
say
there
was
a
force
working
against
her
and
she
would
sit
silent
in
a
chair
while
madame
gaped
at
her
with
open
eyes
at
last
mademoiselle
would
say
that
the
powers
were
favourable
and
the
spirits
would
manifest
themselves
then
she
would
be
placed
in
a
cabinet
perhaps
with
a
string
tied
across
the
door
outside
you
will
understand
it
was
my
business
to
see
after
the
string
and
the
lights
would
be
turned
down
or
perhaps
out
altogether
or
at
other
times
we
would
sit
holding
hands
round
a
table
mlle
celie
between
mme
dauvray
and
myself
but
in
that
case
the
lights
would
be
turned
out
first
and
it
would
be
really
my
hand
which
held
mme
dauvray
and
whether
it
was
the
cabinet
or
the
chairs
in
a
moment
mademoiselle
would
be
creeping
silently
about
the
room
in
a
little
pair
of
slippers
without
heels
which
she
wore
so
that
she
might
not
be
heard
and
tambourines
would
rattle
as
you
say
and
fingers
touch
the
forehead
and
the
neck
and
strange
voices
would
sound
from
corners
of
the
room
and
dim
apparitions
would
appear
the
spirits
of
great
ladies
of
the
past
who
would
talk
with
mme
dauvray
such
ladies
as
mme
de
castiglione
marie
antoinette
mme
de
medici
i
do
not
remember
all
the
names
and
very
likely
i
do
not
pronounce
them
properly
then
the
voices
would
cease
and
the
lights
be
turned
up
and
mlle
celie
would
be
found
in
a
trance
just
in
the
same
place
and
attitude
as
she
had
been
when
the
lights
were
turned
out
imagine
messieurs
the
effect
of
such
seances
upon
a
woman
like
mme
dauvray
she
was
made
for
them
she
believed
in
them
implicitly
the
words
of
the
great
ladies
from
the
past
she
would
remember
and
repeat
them
and
be
very
proud
that
such
great
ladies
had
come
back
to
the
world
merely
to
tell
her
mme
dauvray
about
their
lives
she
would
have
had
seances
all
day
but
mlle
celie
pleaded
that
she
was
left
exhausted
at
the
end
of
them
but
mlle
celie
was
of
an
address
for
instance
it
will
seem
very
absurd
and
ridiculous
to
you
gentlemen
but
you
must
remember
what
mme
dauvray
was
for
instance
madame
was
particularly
anxious
to
speak
with
the
spirit
of
mme
de
montespan
yes
yes
she
had
read
all
the
memoirs
about
that
lady
very
likely
mlle
celie
had
put
the
notion
into
mme
dauvray
head
for
madame
was
not
a
scholar
but
she
was
dying
to
hear
that
famous
woman
voice
and
to
catch
a
dim
glimpse
of
her
face
well
she
was
never
gratified
always
she
hoped
always
mlle
celie
tantalised
her
with
the
hope
but
she
would
not
gratify
it
she
would
not
spoil
her
fine
affairs
by
making
these
treats
too
common
and
she
acquired
how
should
she
not
a
power
over
mme
dauvray
which
was
unassailable
the
had
no
more
to
say
to
mme
dauvray
she
did
nothing
but
felicitate
herself
upon
the
happy
chance
which
had
sent
her
mlle
celie
and
now
she
lies
in
her
room
murdered
once
more
helene
voice
broke
upon
the
words
but
hanaud
poured
her
out
a
glass
of
water
and
held
it
to
her
lips
helene
drank
it
eagerly
there
that
is
better
is
it
not
he
said
yes
monsieur
said
helene
vauquier
recovering
herself
sometimes
too
she
resumed
messages
from
the
spirits
would
flutter
down
in
writing
on
the
table
in
writing
exclaimed
hanaud
quickly
yes
answers
to
questions
mlle
celie
had
them
ready
oh
but
she
was
of
an
address
altogether
surprising
i
see
said
hanaud
slowly
and
he
added
but
sometimes
i
suppose
the
questions
were
questions
which
mlle
celie
could
not
answer
sometimes
helene
vauquier
admitted
when
visitors
were
present
when
mme
dauvray
was
alone
well
she
was
an
ignorant
woman
and
any
answer
would
serve
but
it
was
not
so
when
there
were
visitors
whom
mlle
celie
did
not
know
or
only
knew
slightly
these
visitors
might
be
putting
questions
to
test
her
of
which
they
knew
the
answers
while
mlle
celie
did
not
exactly
said
hanaud
what
happened
then
all
who
were
listening
understood
to
what
point
he
was
leading
helene
vauquier
all
waited
intently
for
her
answer
she
smiled
it
was
all
one
to
mlle
celie
she
was
prepared
with
an
escape
from
the
difficulty
perfectly
prepared
hanaud
looked
puzzled
i
can
think
of
no
way
out
of
it
except
the
one
and
he
looked
round
to
the
commissaire
and
to
ricardo
as
though
he
would
inquire
of
them
how
many
ways
they
had
discovered
i
can
think
of
no
escape
except
that
a
message
in
writing
should
flutter
down
from
the
spirit
appealed
to
saying
frankly
and
hanaud
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
not
know
oh
no
no
monsieur
replied
helene
vauquier
in
pity
for
misconception
i
see
that
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
attending
seances
it
would
never
do
for
a
spirit
to
admit
that
it
did
not
know
at
once
its
authority
would
be
gone
and
with
it
mlle
celie
as
well
but
on
the
other
hand
for
inscrutable
reasons
the
spirit
might
not
be
allowed
to
answer
i
understand
said
hanaud
meekly
accepting
the
correction
the
spirit
might
reply
that
it
was
forbidden
to
answer
but
never
that
it
did
not
know
no
never
that
said
helene
so
it
seemed
that
hanaud
must
look
elsewhere
for
the
explanation
of
that
sentence
i
do
not
know
helene
continued
oh
mlle
celie
it
was
not
easy
to
baffle
her
i
can
tell
you
she
carried
a
lace
scarf
which
she
could
drape
about
her
head
and
in
a
moment
she
would
be
in
the
dim
light
an
old
old
woman
with
a
voice
so
altered
that
no
one
could
know
it
indeed
you
said
rightly
monsieur
she
was
clever
to
all
who
listened
helene
vauquier
story
carried
its
conviction
mme
dauvray
rose
vividly
before
their
minds
as
a
living
woman
trickeries
were
so
glibly
described
that
they
could
hardly
have
been
invented
and
certainly
not
by
this
poor
whose
lips
so
bravely
struggled
with
medici
and
montespan
and
the
names
of
the
other
great
ladies
how
indeed
should
she
know
of
them
at
all
she
could
never
have
had
the
inspiration
to
concoct
the
most
convincing
item
of
her
story
the
queer
craze
of
mme
dauvray
for
an
interview
with
mme
de
montespan
these
details
were
assuredly
the
truth
ricardo
indeed
knew
them
to
be
true
had
he
not
himself
seen
the
girl
in
her
black
velvet
dress
shut
up
in
a
cabinet
and
a
great
lady
of
the
past
dimly
appear
in
the
darkness
moreover
helene
vauquier
jealousy
was
so
natural
and
inevitable
a
thing
her
confession
of
it
corroborated
all
her
story
well
then
said
hanaud
we
come
to
last
night
there
was
a
seance
held
in
the
salon
last
night
no
monsieur
said
vauquier
shaking
her
head
there
was
no
seance
last
night
but
already
you
have
said
interrupted
the
commissaire
and
hanaud
held
up
his
hand
let
her
speak
my
friend
yes
monsieur
shall
hear
said
vauquier
it
appeared
that
at
five
in
the
afternoon
mme
dauvray
and
mlle
celie
prepared
to
leave
the
house
on
foot
it
was
their
custom
to
walk
down
at
this
hour
to
the
villa
des
fleurs
pass
an
hour
or
so
there
dine
in
a
restaurant
and
return
to
the
rooms
to
spend
the
evening
on
this
occasion
however
mme
dauvray
informed
helene
that
they
should
be
back
early
and
bring
with
them
a
friend
who
was
interested
in
but
entirely
sceptical
of
spiritualistic
manifestations
but
we
shall
convince
her
celie
she
said
confidently
and
the
two
women
then
went
out
shortly
before
eight
helene
closed
the
shutters
both
of
the
upstair
and
the
downstair
windows
and
of
the
glass
doors
into
the
garden
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
which
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
that
is
on
the
side
facing
the
road
there
had
been
a
fall
of
rain
at
seven
which
had
lasted
for
the
greater
part
of
the
hour
and
soon
after
she
had
shut
the
windows
the
rain
fell
again
in
a
heavy
shower
and
helene
knowing
that
madame
felt
the
chill
lighted
a
small
fire
in
the
salon
the
shower
lasted
until
nearly
nine
when
it
ceased
altogether
and
the
night
cleared
up
it
was
close
upon
nine
when
the
bell
rang
from
the
salon
vauquier
was
sure
of
the
hour
for
the
charwoman
called
her
attention
to
the
clock
i
found
mme
dauvray
mlle
celie
and
another
woman
in
the
salon
continued
helene
vauquier
madame
had
let
them
in
with
her
latchkey
ah
the
other
woman
cried
besnard
had
you
seen
her
before
no
monsieur
what
was
she
like
she
was
sallow
with
black
hair
and
bright
eyes
like
beads
she
was
short
and
about
years
old
though
it
is
difficult
to
judge
of
these
things
i
noticed
her
hands
for
she
was
taking
her
gloves
off
and
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
unusually
muscular
for
a
woman
ah
cried
louis
besnard
that
is
important
mme
dauvray
was
as
she
always
was
before
a
seance
in
a
feverish
flutter
will
help
mlle
celie
to
dress
helene
and
be
very
quick
she
said
and
with
an
extraordinary
longing
she
added
we
shall
see
her
her
you
understand
was
mme
de
montespan
and
she
turned
to
the
stranger
and
said
you
will
believe
adele
after
adele
said
the
commissaire
wisely
then
adele
was
the
strange
woman
name
perhaps
said
hanaud
dryly
helene
vauquier
reflected
i
think
adele
was
the
name
she
said
in
a
more
doubtful
tone
it
sounded
like
adele
the
irrepressible
ricardo
was
impelled
to
intervene
what
monsieur
hanaud
means
he
explained
with
the
pleasant
air
of
a
man
happy
to
illuminate
the
dark
intelligence
of
a
child
is
that
adele
was
probably
a
pseudonym
hanaud
turned
to
him
with
a
savage
grin
now
that
is
sure
to
help
her
he
cried
a
pseudonym
helene
vauquier
is
sure
to
understand
that
simple
and
elementary
word
how
bright
this
ricardo
is
where
shall
we
find
a
new
pin
more
bright
i
ask
you
and
he
spread
out
his
hands
in
a
despairing
admiration
ricardo
flushed
red
but
he
answered
never
a
word
he
must
endure
gibes
and
humiliations
like
a
schoolboy
in
a
class
his
one
constant
fear
was
lest
he
should
be
turned
out
of
the
room
the
commissaire
diverted
wrath
from
him
however
what
he
means
by
pseudonym
he
said
to
helene
vauquier
explaining
ricardo
to
her
as
ricardo
had
presumed
to
explain
hanaud
is
a
false
name
adele
may
have
been
nay
probably
was
a
false
name
adopted
by
this
strange
woman
adele
i
think
was
the
name
used
replied
helene
the
doubt
in
her
voice
diminishing
as
she
searched
her
memory
i
am
almost
sure
well
we
will
call
her
adele
said
hanaud
impatiently
what
does
it
matter
go
on
mademoiselle
vauquier
the
lady
sat
upright
and
squarely
upon
the
edge
of
a
chair
with
a
sort
of
defiance
as
though
she
was
determined
nothing
should
convince
her
and
she
laughed
incredulously
here
again
all
who
heard
were
able
vividly
to
conjure
up
the
scene
the
defiant
sceptic
sitting
squarely
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
removing
her
gloves
from
her
muscular
hands
the
excited
mme
dauvray
so
absorbed
in
the
determination
to
convince
and
mlle
celie
running
from
the
room
to
put
on
the
black
gown
which
would
not
be
visible
in
the
dim
light
whilst
i
took
off
mademoiselle
dress
vauquier
continued
she
said
i
have
gone
down
to
the
salon
you
can
go
to
bed
helene
mme
adele
yes
it
was
adele
be
fetched
by
a
friend
in
a
motorcar
and
i
can
let
her
out
and
fasten
the
door
again
so
if
you
hear
the
car
you
will
know
that
it
has
come
for
her
oh
she
said
that
said
hanaud
quickly
yes
monsieur
hanaud
looked
gloomily
towards
wethermill
then
he
exchanged
a
sharp
glance
with
the
commissaire
and
moved
his
shoulders
in
an
almost
imperceptible
shrug
but
ricardo
saw
it
and
construed
it
into
one
word
he
imagined
a
jury
uttering
the
word
guilty
helene
vauquier
saw
the
movement
too
do
not
condemn
her
too
quickly
monsieur
she
said
with
an
impulse
of
remorse
and
not
upon
my
words
for
as
i
say
i
hated
her
hanaud
nodded
reassuringly
and
she
resumed
i
was
surprised
and
i
asked
mademoiselle
what
she
would
do
without
her
confederate
but
she
laughed
and
said
there
would
be
no
difficulty
that
is
partly
why
i
think
there
was
no
seance
held
last
night
monsieur
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
that
evening
which
i
did
not
as
yet
understand
mademoiselle
then
took
her
bath
while
i
laid
out
her
black
dress
and
the
slippers
with
the
soft
noiseless
soles
and
now
i
tell
you
why
i
am
sure
there
was
no
seance
last
night
why
mlle
celie
never
meant
there
should
be
one
yes
let
us
hear
that
said
hanaud
curiously
and
leaning
forward
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
you
have
here
monsieur
a
description
of
how
mademoiselle
was
dressed
when
she
went
away
helene
vauquier
picked
up
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
table
at
her
side
i
wrote
it
out
at
the
request
of
le
commissaire
she
handed
the
paper
to
hanaud
who
glanced
through
it
as
she
continued
well
except
for
the
white
lace
coat
monsieur
i
dressed
mlle
celie
just
in
that
way
she
would
have
none
of
her
plain
black
robe
no
mlle
celie
must
wear
her
fine
new
evening
frock
of
pale
chiffon
over
soft
clinging
satin
which
set
off
her
fair
beauty
so
prettily
it
left
her
white
arms
and
shoulders
bare
and
it
had
a
long
train
and
it
rustled
as
she
moved
and
with
that
she
must
put
on
her
pale
green
silk
stockings
her
new
little
satin
slippers
to
match
with
the
large
paste
buckles
and
a
sash
of
green
satin
looped
through
another
glittering
buckle
at
the
side
of
the
waist
with
long
ends
loosely
knotted
together
at
the
knee
i
must
tie
her
fair
hair
with
a
silver
ribbon
and
pin
upon
her
curls
a
large
hat
of
reseda
green
with
a
ostrich
feather
drooping
behind
i
warned
mademoiselle
that
there
was
a
tiny
fire
burning
in
the
salon
even
with
the
in
front
of
it
there
would
still
be
a
little
light
upon
the
floor
and
the
glittering
buckles
on
her
feet
would
betray
her
even
if
the
rustle
of
her
dress
did
not
but
she
said
she
would
kick
her
slippers
off
ah
gentlemen
it
is
after
all
not
so
that
one
dresses
for
a
seance
she
cried
shaking
her
head
but
it
is
just
so
is
it
not
that
one
dresses
to
go
to
meet
a
lover
the
suggestion
startled
every
one
who
heard
it
it
fairly
took
ricardo
breath
away
wethermill
stepped
forward
with
a
cry
of
revolt
the
commissaire
exclaimed
admiringly
but
here
is
an
idea
even
hanaud
sat
back
in
his
chair
though
his
expression
lost
nothing
of
its
impassivity
and
his
eyes
never
moved
from
helene
vauquier
face
listen
she
continued
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
it
was
my
habit
to
put
out
some
sirop
and
lemonade
and
some
little
cakes
in
the
which
as
you
know
is
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
across
the
hall
i
think
it
possible
messieurs
that
while
mlle
celie
was
changing
her
dress
mme
dauvray
and
the
stranger
adele
went
into
the
i
know
that
mlle
celie
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
ran
downstairs
to
the
salon
well
then
suppose
mlle
celie
had
a
lover
waiting
with
whom
she
meant
to
run
away
she
hurries
through
the
empty
salon
opens
the
glass
doors
and
is
gone
leaving
the
doors
open
and
the
thief
an
accomplice
of
adele
finds
the
doors
open
and
hides
himself
in
the
salon
until
mme
dauvray
returns
from
the
you
see
that
leaves
mlle
celie
innocent
vauquier
leaned
forward
eagerly
her
white
face
flushing
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
hanaud
said
that
is
all
very
well
mlle
vauquier
but
it
does
not
account
for
the
lace
coat
in
which
the
girl
went
away
she
must
have
returned
to
her
room
to
fetch
that
after
you
had
gone
to
bed
helene
vauquier
leaned
back
with
an
air
of
disappointment
that
is
true
i
had
forgotten
the
coat
i
did
not
like
mlle
celie
but
i
am
not
wicked
nor
for
the
fact
that
the
sirop
and
the
lemonade
had
not
been
touched
in
the
said
the
commissaire
interrupting
her
again
the
disappointment
overspread
vauquier
face
is
that
so
she
asked
i
did
not
know
i
have
been
kept
a
prisoner
here
the
commissaire
cut
her
short
with
a
cry
of
satisfaction
listen
listen
he
exclaimed
excitedly
here
is
a
theory
which
accounts
for
all
which
combines
vauquier
idea
with
ours
and
vauquier
idea
is
i
think
very
just
up
to
a
point
suppose
hanaud
that
the
girl
was
going
to
meet
her
lover
but
the
lover
is
the
murderer
then
all
becomes
clear
she
does
not
run
away
to
him
she
opens
the
door
for
him
and
lets
him
in
both
hanaud
and
ricardo
stole
a
glance
at
wethermill
how
did
he
take
the
theory
wethermill
was
leaning
against
the
wall
his
eyes
closed
his
face
white
and
contorted
with
a
spasm
of
pain
but
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
silently
enduring
an
outrage
rather
than
struck
down
by
the
conviction
that
the
woman
he
loved
was
worthless
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
monsieur
helene
vauquier
continued
i
only
tell
you
what
i
know
i
am
a
woman
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
girl
who
was
eagerly
expecting
her
lover
so
to
act
that
another
woman
would
not
know
it
however
uncultivated
and
ignorant
the
other
woman
was
that
at
all
events
she
would
know
the
knowledge
would
spread
to
her
of
itself
without
a
word
consider
gentlemen
and
suddenly
helene
vauquier
smiled
a
young
girl
tingling
with
excitement
from
head
to
foot
eager
that
her
beauty
just
at
this
moment
should
be
more
fresh
more
sweet
than
ever
it
was
careful
that
her
dress
should
set
it
exquisitely
off
imagine
it
her
lips
ready
for
the
kiss
oh
how
should
another
woman
not
know
i
saw
mlle
celie
her
cheeks
rosy
her
eyes
bright
never
had
she
looked
so
lovely
the
hat
upon
her
fair
head
heavy
with
its
curls
from
head
to
foot
she
looked
herself
over
and
then
she
sighed
she
sighed
with
pleasure
because
she
looked
so
pretty
that
was
mlle
celie
last
night
monsieur
she
gathered
up
her
train
took
her
long
white
gloves
in
the
other
hand
and
ran
down
the
stairs
her
heels
clicking
on
the
wood
her
buckles
glittering
at
the
bottom
she
turned
and
said
to
me
helene
you
can
go
to
bed
that
was
it
monsieur
and
now
violently
the
rancour
of
helene
vauquier
feelings
burst
out
once
more
for
her
the
fine
clothes
the
pleasure
and
the
happiness
for
me
i
could
go
to
bed
hanaud
looked
again
at
the
description
which
helene
vauquier
had
written
out
and
read
it
through
carefully
then
he
asked
a
question
of
which
ricardo
did
not
quite
see
the
drift
so
he
said
when
this
morning
you
suggested
to
monsieur
the
commissaire
that
it
would
be
advisable
for
you
to
go
through
mlle
celie
wardrobe
you
found
that
nothing
more
had
been
taken
away
except
the
white
lace
coat
that
is
so
very
well
now
after
mlle
celie
had
gone
down
the
stairs
i
put
the
lights
out
in
her
room
and
as
she
had
ordered
me
to
do
i
went
to
bed
the
next
thing
that
i
remember
but
no
it
terrifies
me
too
much
to
think
of
it
helene
shuddered
and
covered
her
face
spasmodically
with
her
hands
hanaud
drew
her
hands
gently
down
courage
you
are
safe
now
mademoiselle
calm
yourself
she
lay
back
with
her
eyes
closed
yes
yes
it
is
true
i
am
safe
now
but
oh
i
feel
i
shall
never
dare
to
sleep
again
and
the
tears
swam
in
her
eyes
i
woke
up
with
a
feeling
of
being
suffocated
mon
dieu
there
was
the
light
burning
in
the
room
and
a
woman
the
strange
woman
with
the
strong
hands
was
holding
me
down
by
the
shoulders
while
a
man
with
his
cap
drawn
over
his
eyes
and
a
little
black
moustache
pressed
over
my
lips
a
pad
from
which
a
horribly
sweet
and
sickly
taste
filled
my
mouth
oh
i
was
terrified
i
could
not
scream
i
struggled
the
woman
told
me
roughly
to
keep
quiet
but
i
could
not
i
must
struggle
and
then
with
a
brutality
unheard
of
she
dragged
me
up
on
to
my
knees
while
the
man
kept
the
pad
right
over
my
mouth
the
man
with
the
arm
which
was
free
held
me
close
to
him
and
she
bound
my
hands
with
a
cord
behind
me
look
she
held
out
her
wrists
they
were
terribly
bruised
red
and
angry
lines
showed
where
the
cord
had
cut
deeply
into
her
flesh
then
they
flung
me
down
again
upon
my
back
and
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
the
doctor
standing
over
me
and
this
kind
nurse
supporting
me
she
sank
back
exhausted
in
her
chair
and
wiped
her
forehead
with
her
handkerchief
the
sweat
stood
upon
it
in
beads
thank
you
mademoiselle
said
hanaud
gravely
this
has
been
a
trying
ordeal
for
you
i
understand
that
but
we
are
coming
to
the
end
i
want
you
to
read
this
description
of
mlle
celie
through
again
to
make
sure
that
nothing
is
omitted
he
gave
the
paper
into
the
maid
hands
it
will
be
advertised
so
it
is
important
that
it
should
be
complete
see
that
you
have
left
out
nothing
helene
vauquier
bent
her
head
over
the
paper
no
said
helene
at
last
i
do
not
think
i
have
omitted
anything
and
she
handed
the
paper
back
i
asked
you
hanaud
continued
suavely
because
i
understand
that
mlle
celie
usually
wore
a
pair
of
diamond
and
they
are
not
mentioned
here
a
faint
colour
came
into
the
maid
face
that
is
true
monsieur
i
had
forgotten
it
is
quite
true
any
one
might
forget
said
hanaud
with
a
reassuring
smile
but
you
will
remember
now
think
think
did
mlle
celie
wear
them
last
night
he
leaned
forward
waiting
for
her
reply
wethermill
too
made
a
movement
both
men
evidently
thought
the
point
of
great
importance
the
maid
looked
at
hanaud
for
a
few
moments
without
speaking
it
is
not
from
me
mademoiselle
that
you
will
get
the
answer
said
hanaud
quietly
no
monsieur
i
was
thinking
said
the
maid
her
face
flushing
at
the
rebuke
did
she
wear
them
when
she
went
down
the
stairs
last
night
he
insisted
i
think
she
wore
them
she
said
doubtfully
yes
and
the
words
came
now
firm
and
clear
i
remember
well
mlle
celie
had
taken
them
off
before
her
bath
and
they
lay
on
the
she
put
them
into
her
ears
while
i
dressed
her
hair
and
arranged
the
bow
of
ribbon
in
it
then
we
will
add
the
earrings
to
your
description
said
hanaud
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
for
the
moment
we
need
not
trouble
you
any
more
about
mademoiselle
celie
he
folded
the
paper
up
slipped
it
into
his
and
put
it
away
in
his
pocket
let
us
consider
that
poor
madame
dauvray
did
she
keep
much
money
in
the
house
no
monsieur
very
little
she
was
well
known
in
aix
and
her
cheques
were
everywhere
accepted
without
question
it
was
a
high
pleasure
to
serve
madame
her
credit
was
so
good
said
helene
vauquier
raising
her
head
as
though
she
herself
had
a
share
in
the
pride
of
that
good
credit
no
doubt
hanaud
agreed
there
are
many
fine
households
where
the
banking
account
is
overdrawn
and
it
can
not
be
pleasant
for
the
servants
they
are
put
to
so
many
shifts
to
hide
it
from
the
servants
of
their
neighbours
said
helene
besides
and
she
made
a
little
grimace
of
contempt
a
fine
household
and
an
overdrawn
banking
account
it
is
like
a
ragged
petticoat
under
a
satin
dress
that
was
never
the
case
with
madame
dauvray
so
that
she
was
under
no
necessity
to
have
ready
money
always
in
her
pocket
said
hanaud
i
understand
that
but
at
times
perhaps
she
won
at
the
villa
des
fleurs
helene
vauquier
shook
her
head
she
loved
the
villa
des
fleurs
but
she
never
played
for
high
sums
and
often
never
played
at
all
if
she
won
a
few
louis
she
was
as
delighted
with
her
gains
and
as
afraid
to
lose
them
again
at
the
tables
as
if
she
were
of
the
poorest
and
she
stopped
at
once
no
monsieur
twenty
or
thirty
louis
there
was
never
more
than
that
in
the
house
then
it
was
certainly
for
her
famous
collection
of
jewellery
that
madame
dauvray
was
murdered
certainly
monsieur
now
where
did
she
keep
her
jewellery
in
a
safe
in
her
bedroom
monsieur
every
night
she
took
off
what
she
had
been
wearing
and
locked
it
up
with
the
rest
she
was
never
too
tired
for
that
and
what
did
she
do
with
the
keys
that
i
can
not
tell
you
certainly
she
locked
her
rings
and
necklaces
away
whilst
i
undressed
her
and
she
laid
the
keys
upon
the
or
the
anywhere
but
in
the
morning
the
keys
were
no
longer
where
she
had
left
them
she
had
put
them
secretly
away
hanaud
turned
to
another
point
i
suppose
that
mademoiselle
celie
knew
of
the
safe
and
that
the
jewels
were
kept
there
oh
yes
mademoiselle
indeed
was
often
in
madame
dauvray
room
when
she
was
dressing
or
undressing
she
must
often
have
seen
madame
take
them
out
and
lock
them
up
again
but
then
monsieur
so
did
i
hanaud
nodded
to
her
with
a
friendly
smile
thank
you
once
more
mademoiselle
he
said
the
torture
is
over
but
of
course
monsieur
fleuriot
will
require
your
presence
helene
vauquier
looked
anxiously
towards
him
but
meanwhile
i
can
go
from
this
villa
monsieur
she
pleaded
with
a
trembling
voice
certainly
you
shall
go
to
your
friends
at
once
oh
monsieur
thank
you
she
cried
and
suddenly
she
gave
way
the
tears
began
to
flow
from
her
eyes
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
it
is
foolish
of
me
but
what
would
you
she
jerked
out
the
words
between
her
sobs
it
has
been
too
terrible
yes
yes
said
hanaud
soothingly
the
nurse
will
put
a
few
things
together
for
you
in
a
bag
you
will
not
leave
aix
of
course
and
i
will
send
some
one
with
you
to
your
friends
the
maid
started
violently
oh
not
a
monsieur
i
beg
of
you
i
should
be
disgraced
no
it
shall
be
a
man
in
plain
clothes
to
see
that
you
are
not
hindered
by
reporters
on
the
way
hanaud
turned
towards
the
door
on
the
a
cord
was
lying
he
took
it
up
and
spoke
to
the
nurse
was
this
the
cord
with
which
helene
vauquier
hands
were
tied
yes
monsieur
she
replied
hanaud
handed
it
to
the
commissaire
it
will
be
necessary
to
keep
that
he
said
it
was
a
thin
piece
of
strong
whipcord
it
was
the
same
kind
of
cord
as
that
which
had
been
found
tied
round
mme
dauvray
throat
hanaud
opened
the
door
and
turned
back
to
the
nurse
we
will
send
for
a
cab
for
mlle
vauquier
you
will
drive
with
her
to
her
door
i
think
after
that
she
will
need
no
further
help
pack
up
a
few
things
and
bring
them
down
mlle
vauquier
can
follow
no
doubt
now
without
assistance
and
with
a
friendly
nod
he
left
the
room
ricardo
had
been
wondering
through
the
examination
in
what
light
hanaud
considered
helene
vauquier
he
was
sympathetic
but
the
sympathy
might
merely
have
been
assumed
to
deceive
his
questions
betrayed
in
no
particular
the
colour
of
his
mind
now
however
he
made
himself
clear
he
informed
the
nurse
in
the
plainest
possible
way
that
she
was
no
longer
to
act
as
jailer
she
was
to
bring
vauquier
things
down
but
vauquier
could
follow
by
herself
evidently
helene
vauquier
was
cleared
chapter
vii
a
startling
discovery
harry
wethermill
however
was
not
so
easily
satisfied
surely
monsieur
it
would
be
well
to
know
whither
she
is
going
he
said
and
to
make
sure
that
when
she
has
gone
there
she
will
stay
there
until
we
want
her
again
hanaud
looked
at
the
young
man
pityingly
i
can
understand
monsieur
that
you
hold
strong
views
about
helene
vauquier
you
are
human
like
the
rest
of
us
and
what
she
has
said
to
us
just
now
would
not
make
you
more
friendly
but
but
and
he
preferred
to
shrug
his
shoulders
rather
than
to
finish
in
words
his
sentence
however
he
said
we
shall
take
care
to
know
where
helene
vauquier
is
staying
indeed
if
she
is
at
all
implicated
in
this
affair
we
shall
learn
more
if
we
leave
her
free
than
if
we
keep
her
under
lock
and
key
you
see
that
if
we
leave
her
quite
free
but
watch
her
very
very
carefully
so
as
to
awaken
no
suspicion
she
may
be
emboldened
to
do
something
rash
or
the
others
may
ricardo
approved
of
hanaud
reasoning
that
is
quite
true
he
said
she
might
write
a
letter
yes
or
receive
one
added
hanaud
which
would
be
still
more
satisfactory
for
us
supposing
of
course
that
she
has
anything
to
do
with
this
affair
and
again
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
turned
towards
the
commissaire
you
have
a
discreet
officer
whom
you
can
trust
he
asked
certainly
a
dozen
i
want
only
one
and
here
he
is
said
the
commissaire
they
were
descending
the
stairs
on
the
landing
of
the
first
floor
durette
the
man
who
had
discovered
where
the
cord
was
bought
was
still
waiting
hanaud
took
durette
by
the
sleeve
in
the
familiar
way
which
he
so
commonly
used
and
led
him
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
where
the
two
men
stood
for
a
few
moments
apart
it
was
plain
that
hanaud
was
giving
durette
receiving
definite
instructions
durette
descended
the
stairs
hanaud
came
back
to
the
others
i
have
told
him
to
fetch
a
cab
he
said
and
convey
helene
vauquier
to
her
friends
then
he
looked
at
ricardo
and
from
ricardo
to
the
commissaire
while
he
rubbed
his
hand
backwards
and
forwards
across
his
shaven
chin
i
tell
you
he
said
i
find
this
sinister
little
drama
very
interesting
to
me
the
sordid
miserable
struggle
for
mastery
in
this
household
of
mme
dauvray
eh
yes
very
interesting
just
as
much
patience
just
as
much
effort
just
as
much
planning
for
this
small
end
as
a
general
uses
to
defeat
an
army
and
at
the
last
nothing
gained
what
else
is
politics
yes
very
interesting
his
eyes
rested
upon
wethermill
face
for
a
moment
but
they
gave
the
young
man
no
hope
he
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
we
need
not
keep
this
room
locked
he
said
we
know
all
that
there
is
to
be
known
and
he
inserted
the
key
into
the
lock
of
celia
room
and
turned
it
but
is
that
wise
monsieur
said
besnard
hanaud
shrugged
his
shoulders
why
not
he
asked
the
case
is
in
your
hands
said
the
commissaire
to
ricardo
the
proceedings
seemed
singularly
irregular
but
if
the
commissaire
was
content
it
was
not
for
him
to
object
and
where
is
my
excellent
friend
perrichet
asked
hanaud
and
leaning
over
the
balustrade
he
called
him
up
from
the
hall
we
will
now
said
hanaud
have
a
glance
into
this
poor
murdered
woman
room
the
room
was
opposite
to
celia
besnard
produced
the
key
and
unlocked
the
door
hanaud
took
off
his
hat
upon
the
threshold
and
then
passed
into
the
room
with
his
companions
upon
the
bed
outlined
under
a
sheet
lay
the
rigid
form
of
mme
dauvray
hanaud
stepped
gently
to
the
bedside
and
reverently
uncovered
the
face
for
a
moment
all
could
see
it
livid
swollen
unhuman
a
brutal
business
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
when
he
turned
again
to
his
companions
his
face
was
white
and
sickly
he
replaced
the
sheet
and
gazed
about
the
room
it
was
decorated
and
furnished
in
the
same
style
as
the
salon
downstairs
yet
the
contrast
between
the
two
rooms
was
remarkable
downstairs
in
the
salon
only
a
chair
had
been
overturned
here
there
was
every
sign
of
violence
and
disorder
an
empty
safe
stood
open
in
one
corner
the
rugs
upon
the
polished
floor
had
been
tossed
aside
every
drawer
had
been
torn
open
every
wardrobe
burst
the
very
bed
had
been
moved
from
its
position
it
was
in
this
safe
that
madame
dauvray
hid
her
jewels
each
night
said
the
commissaire
as
hanaud
gazed
about
the
room
oh
was
it
so
hanaud
asked
slowly
it
seemed
to
ricardo
that
he
read
something
in
the
aspect
of
this
room
too
which
troubled
his
mind
and
increased
his
perplexity
yes
said
besnard
confidently
every
night
mme
dauvray
locked
her
jewels
away
in
this
safe
vauquier
told
us
so
this
morning
every
night
she
was
never
too
tired
for
that
besides
here
and
putting
his
hand
into
the
safe
he
drew
out
a
paper
here
is
the
list
of
mme
jewellery
plainly
however
hanaud
was
not
satisfied
he
took
the
list
and
glanced
through
the
items
but
his
thoughts
were
not
concerned
with
it
if
that
is
so
he
said
slowly
mme
dauvray
kept
her
jewels
in
this
safe
why
has
every
drawer
been
ransacked
why
was
the
bed
moved
perrichet
lock
the
door
quietly
from
the
inside
that
is
right
now
lean
your
back
against
it
hanaud
waited
until
he
saw
perrichet
broad
back
against
the
door
then
he
went
down
upon
his
knees
and
tossing
the
rugs
here
and
there
examined
with
the
minutest
care
the
inlaid
floor
by
the
side
of
the
bed
a
persian
mat
of
blue
silk
was
spread
this
in
its
turn
he
moved
quickly
aside
he
bent
his
eyes
to
the
ground
lay
prone
moved
this
way
and
that
to
catch
the
light
upon
the
floor
then
with
a
spring
he
rose
upon
his
knees
he
lifted
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
a
dead
silence
he
drew
a
quickly
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
he
bent
down
again
and
inserted
the
blade
between
the
cracks
of
the
blocks
the
three
men
in
the
room
watched
him
with
an
intense
excitement
a
block
of
wood
rose
from
the
floor
he
pulled
it
out
laid
it
noiselessly
down
and
inserted
his
hand
into
the
opening
wethermill
at
ricardo
elbow
uttered
a
stifled
cry
hush
whispered
hanaud
angrily
he
drew
out
his
hand
again
it
was
holding
a
green
leather
he
opened
it
and
a
diamond
necklace
flashed
its
thousand
colours
in
their
faces
he
thrust
in
his
hand
again
and
again
and
again
and
each
time
that
he
withdrew
it
it
held
a
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
his
companions
he
opened
them
ropes
of
pearls
collars
of
diamonds
necklaces
of
emeralds
rings
of
rubies
bracelets
of
gold
studded
with
opals
mme
dauvray
various
jewellery
was
disclosed
but
that
is
astounding
said
besnard
in
an
voice
then
she
was
never
robbed
after
all
cried
ricardo
hanaud
rose
to
his
feet
what
a
piece
of
irony
he
whispered
the
poor
woman
is
murdered
for
her
jewels
the
room
turned
upside
down
and
nothing
is
found
for
all
the
while
they
lay
safe
in
this
cache
nothing
is
taken
except
what
she
wore
let
us
see
what
she
wore
only
a
few
rings
helene
vauquier
thought
said
besnard
but
she
was
not
sure
ah
said
hanaud
well
let
us
make
sure
and
taking
the
list
from
the
safe
he
compared
it
with
the
jewellery
in
the
cases
on
the
floor
ticking
off
the
items
one
by
one
when
he
had
finished
he
knelt
down
again
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
hole
felt
carefully
about
there
is
a
pearl
necklace
missing
he
said
a
valuable
necklace
from
the
description
in
the
list
and
some
rings
she
must
have
been
wearing
them
and
he
sat
back
upon
his
heels
we
will
send
the
intelligent
perrichet
for
a
bag
he
said
and
we
will
counsel
the
intelligent
perrichet
not
to
breathe
a
word
to
any
living
soul
of
what
he
has
seen
in
this
room
then
we
will
seal
up
in
the
bag
the
jewels
and
we
will
hand
it
over
to
le
commissaire
who
will
convey
it
with
the
greatest
secrecy
out
of
this
villa
for
the
list
i
will
keep
it
and
he
placed
it
carefully
in
his
he
unlocked
the
door
and
went
out
himself
on
to
the
landing
he
looked
down
the
stairs
and
up
the
stairs
then
he
beckoned
perrichet
to
him
go
he
whispered
be
quick
and
when
you
come
back
hide
the
bag
carefully
under
your
coat
perrichet
went
down
the
stairs
with
pride
written
upon
his
face
was
he
not
assisting
the
great
hanaud
from
the
surete
in
paris
hanaud
returned
into
mme
dauvray
room
and
closed
the
door
he
looked
into
the
eyes
of
his
companions
ca
you
see
the
scene
he
asked
with
a
queer
smile
of
excitement
he
had
forgotten
wethermill
he
had
forgotten
even
the
dead
woman
shrouded
beneath
the
sheet
he
was
absorbed
his
eyes
were
bright
his
whole
face
vivid
with
life
ricardo
saw
the
real
man
at
this
moment
and
feared
for
the
happiness
of
harry
wethermill
for
nothing
would
hanaud
now
turn
aside
until
he
had
reached
the
truth
and
set
his
hands
upon
the
quarry
of
that
ricardo
felt
sure
he
was
trying
now
to
make
his
companions
visualise
just
what
he
saw
and
understood
ca
you
see
it
the
old
woman
locking
up
her
jewels
in
this
safe
every
night
before
the
eyes
of
her
maid
or
her
companion
and
then
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
taking
them
stealthily
out
of
the
safe
and
hiding
them
in
this
secret
place
but
i
tell
you
this
is
human
yes
it
is
interesting
just
because
it
is
so
human
then
picture
to
yourselves
last
night
the
murderers
opening
this
safe
and
finding
nothing
oh
but
nothing
and
ransacking
the
room
in
deadly
haste
kicking
up
the
rugs
forcing
open
the
drawers
and
always
finding
nothing
nothing
nothing
think
of
their
rage
their
stupefaction
and
finally
their
fear
they
must
go
and
with
one
pearl
necklace
when
they
had
hoped
to
reap
a
great
fortune
oh
but
this
is
interesting
yes
i
tell
you
i
who
have
seen
many
strange
things
this
is
interesting
perrichet
returned
with
a
canvas
bag
into
which
hanaud
placed
the
he
sealed
the
bag
in
the
presence
of
the
four
men
and
handed
it
to
besnard
he
replaced
the
block
of
wood
in
the
floor
covered
it
over
again
with
the
rug
and
rose
to
his
feet
listen
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
gravity
which
impressed
them
all
there
is
something
in
this
house
which
i
do
not
understand
i
have
told
you
so
i
tell
you
something
more
now
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
and
the
word
startled
his
hearers
like
a
thunderclap
though
it
was
breathed
no
louder
than
a
whisper
yes
my
friends
he
repeated
nodding
his
head
terribly
afraid
and
upon
the
others
fell
a
discomfort
an
awe
as
though
something
sinister
and
dangerous
were
present
in
the
room
and
close
to
them
so
vivid
was
the
feeling
instinctively
they
drew
nearer
together
now
i
warn
you
solemnly
there
must
be
no
whisper
that
these
jewels
have
been
discovered
no
newspaper
must
publish
a
hint
of
it
no
one
must
suspect
that
here
in
this
room
we
have
found
them
is
that
understood
certainly
said
the
commissaire
yes
said
ricardo
to
be
sure
monsieur
said
perrichet
as
for
harry
wethermill
he
made
no
reply
his
burning
eyes
were
fixed
upon
hanaud
face
and
that
was
all
hanaud
for
his
part
asked
for
no
reply
from
him
indeed
he
did
not
look
towards
harry
face
at
all
ricardo
understood
hanaud
did
not
mean
to
be
deterred
by
the
suffering
written
there
he
went
down
again
into
the
little
gay
salon
lit
with
flowers
and
august
sunlight
and
stood
beside
the
couch
gazing
at
it
with
troubled
eyes
and
as
he
gazed
he
closed
his
eyes
and
shivered
he
shivered
like
a
man
who
has
taken
a
sudden
chill
nothing
in
all
this
investigations
not
even
the
rigid
body
beneath
the
sheet
nor
the
strange
discovery
of
the
jewels
had
so
impressed
ricardo
for
there
he
had
been
confronted
with
facts
definite
and
complete
here
was
a
suggestion
of
unknown
horrors
a
hint
not
a
fact
compelling
the
imagination
to
dark
conjecture
hanaud
shivered
that
he
had
no
idea
why
hanaud
shivered
made
the
action
still
more
significant
still
more
alarming
and
it
was
not
ricardo
alone
who
was
moved
by
it
a
voice
of
despair
rang
through
the
room
the
voice
was
harry
wethermill
and
his
face
was
ashy
white
monsieur
he
cried
i
do
not
know
what
makes
you
shudder
but
i
am
remembering
a
few
words
you
used
this
morning
hanaud
turned
upon
his
heel
his
face
was
drawn
and
grey
and
his
eyes
blazed
my
friend
i
also
am
remembering
those
words
he
said
thus
the
two
men
stood
confronting
one
another
eye
to
eye
with
awe
and
fear
in
both
their
faces
ricardo
was
wondering
to
what
words
they
both
referred
when
the
sound
of
wheels
broke
in
upon
the
silence
the
effect
upon
hanaud
was
magical
he
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
helene
vauquier
cab
he
said
lightly
he
drew
out
his
and
lighted
a
cigarette
let
us
see
that
poor
woman
safely
off
it
is
a
closed
cab
i
hope
it
was
a
closed
landau
it
drove
past
the
open
door
of
the
salon
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
in
hanaud
wake
they
all
went
out
into
the
hall
the
nurse
came
down
alone
carrying
helene
vauquier
bag
she
placed
it
in
the
cab
and
waited
in
the
doorway
perhaps
helene
vauquier
has
fainted
she
said
anxiously
she
does
not
come
and
she
moved
towards
the
stairs
hanaud
took
a
singularly
swift
step
forward
and
stopped
her
why
should
you
think
that
he
asked
with
a
queer
smile
upon
his
face
and
as
he
spoke
a
door
closed
gently
upstairs
see
he
continued
you
are
wrong
she
is
coming
ricardo
was
puzzled
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
the
door
which
had
closed
so
gently
was
nearer
than
helene
vauquier
door
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
door
was
upon
the
first
not
the
second
landing
but
hanaud
had
noticed
nothing
strange
so
it
could
not
be
he
greeted
helene
vauquier
with
a
smile
as
she
came
down
the
stairs
you
are
better
mademoiselle
he
said
politely
one
can
see
that
there
is
more
colour
in
your
cheeks
a
day
or
two
and
you
will
be
yourself
again
he
held
the
door
open
while
she
got
into
the
cab
the
nurse
took
her
seat
beside
her
durette
mounted
on
the
box
the
cab
turned
and
went
down
the
drive
goodbye
mademoiselle
cried
hanaud
and
he
watched
until
the
high
shrubs
hid
the
cab
from
his
eyes
then
he
behaved
in
an
extraordinary
way
he
turned
and
sprang
like
lightning
up
the
stairs
his
agility
amazed
ricardo
the
others
followed
upon
his
heels
he
flung
himself
at
celia
door
and
opened
it
he
burst
into
the
room
stood
for
a
second
then
ran
to
the
window
he
hid
behind
the
curtain
looking
out
with
his
hand
he
waved
to
his
companions
to
keep
back
the
sound
of
wheels
creaking
and
rasping
rose
to
their
ears
the
cab
had
just
come
out
into
the
road
durette
upon
the
box
turned
and
looked
towards
the
house
just
for
a
moment
hanaud
leaned
from
the
window
as
besnard
the
commissaire
had
done
and
like
besnard
again
he
waved
his
hand
then
he
came
back
into
the
room
and
saw
standing
in
front
of
him
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
perrichet
the
intelligent
perrichet
monsieur
cried
perrichet
something
has
been
taken
from
this
room
hanaud
looked
round
the
room
and
shook
his
head
no
he
said
but
yes
monsieur
perrichet
insisted
oh
but
yes
see
upon
this
there
was
a
small
pot
of
cold
cream
it
stood
here
where
my
finger
is
when
we
were
in
this
room
an
hour
ago
now
it
is
gone
hanaud
burst
into
a
laugh
my
friend
perrichet
he
said
ironically
i
will
tell
you
the
newspaper
did
not
do
you
justice
you
are
more
intelligent
the
truth
my
excellent
friend
lies
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
but
you
would
find
it
at
the
bottom
of
a
pot
of
cold
cream
now
let
us
go
for
in
this
house
gentlemen
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
he
passed
out
of
the
room
perrichet
stood
aside
his
face
crimson
his
attitude
one
of
shame
he
had
been
rebuked
by
the
great
hanaud
and
justly
rebuked
he
knew
it
now
he
had
wished
to
display
his
intelligence
yes
at
all
costs
he
must
show
how
intelligent
he
was
and
he
had
shown
himself
a
fool
he
should
have
kept
silence
about
that
pot
of
cream
chapter
viii
the
captain
of
the
ship
hanaud
walked
away
from
the
villa
rose
in
the
company
of
wethermill
and
ricardo
we
will
go
and
lunch
he
said
yes
come
to
my
hotel
said
harry
wethermill
but
hanaud
shook
his
head
no
come
with
me
to
the
villa
des
fleurs
he
replied
we
may
learn
something
there
and
in
a
case
like
this
every
minute
is
of
importance
we
have
to
be
quick
i
may
come
too
cried
ricardo
eagerly
by
all
means
replied
hanaud
with
a
smile
of
extreme
courtesy
nothing
could
be
more
delicious
than
monsieur
suggestions
and
with
that
remark
he
walked
on
silently
ricardo
was
in
a
little
doubt
as
to
the
exact
significance
of
the
words
but
he
was
too
excited
to
dwell
long
upon
them
distressed
though
he
sought
to
be
at
his
friend
grief
he
could
not
but
assume
an
air
of
importance
all
the
artist
in
him
rose
joyfully
to
the
occasion
he
looked
upon
himself
from
the
outside
he
fancied
without
the
slightest
justification
that
people
were
pointing
him
out
that
man
has
been
present
at
the
investigation
at
the
villa
rose
he
seemed
to
hear
people
say
what
strange
things
he
could
tell
us
if
he
would
and
suddenly
ricardo
began
to
reflect
what
after
all
could
he
have
told
them
and
that
question
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
while
he
ate
his
luncheon
hanaud
wrote
a
letter
between
the
courses
they
were
sitting
at
a
corner
table
and
hanaud
was
in
the
corner
with
his
back
to
the
wall
he
moved
his
plate
too
over
the
letter
as
he
wrote
it
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
either
of
his
guests
to
see
what
he
had
written
even
if
they
had
wished
ricardo
indeed
did
wish
he
rather
resented
the
secrecy
with
which
the
detective
under
a
show
of
openness
shrouded
his
thoughts
and
acts
hanaud
sent
the
waiter
out
to
fetch
an
officer
in
plain
clothes
who
was
in
attendance
at
the
door
and
he
handed
the
letter
to
this
man
then
he
turned
with
an
apology
to
his
guests
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
find
out
he
explained
as
soon
as
possible
the
whole
record
of
mlle
celie
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
over
the
coffee
he
put
a
question
to
ricardo
now
tell
me
what
you
make
of
the
case
what
wethermill
thinks
that
is
clear
is
it
not
helene
vauquier
is
the
guilty
one
but
you
ricardo
what
is
your
opinion
ricardo
took
from
his
a
sheet
of
paper
and
from
his
pocket
a
pencil
he
was
intensely
flattered
by
the
request
of
hanaud
and
he
proposed
to
do
himself
justice
i
will
make
a
note
here
of
what
i
think
the
salient
features
of
the
mystery
and
he
proceeded
to
tabulate
the
points
in
the
following
way
celia
harland
made
her
entrance
into
mme
dauvray
household
under
very
doubtful
circumstances
by
methods
still
more
doubtful
she
acquired
an
extraordinary
ascendency
over
mme
dauvray
mind
if
proof
were
needed
how
complete
that
ascendency
was
a
glance
at
celia
harland
wardrobe
would
suffice
for
she
wore
the
most
expensive
clothes
it
was
celia
harland
who
arranged
that
servettaz
the
chauffeur
should
be
absent
at
chambery
on
the
tuesday
night
the
night
of
the
murder
it
was
celia
harland
who
bought
the
cord
with
which
mme
dauvray
was
strangled
and
helene
vauquier
bound
the
footsteps
outside
the
salon
show
that
celia
harland
ran
from
the
salon
to
the
celia
harland
pretended
that
there
should
be
a
seance
on
the
tuesday
but
she
dressed
as
though
she
had
in
view
an
appointment
with
a
lover
instead
of
a
spiritualistic
seance
celia
harland
has
disappeared
these
eight
points
are
strongly
suggestive
of
celia
complicity
in
the
murder
but
i
have
no
clue
which
will
enable
me
to
answer
the
following
questions
a
who
was
the
man
who
took
part
in
the
crime
b
who
was
the
woman
who
came
to
the
villa
on
the
evening
of
the
murder
with
mme
dauvray
and
celia
harland
c
what
actually
happened
in
the
salon
how
was
the
murder
committed
d
is
helene
vauquier
story
true
e
what
did
the
scrap
of
writing
mean
probably
spirit
writing
in
celia
harland
hand
f
why
has
one
cushion
on
the
settee
a
small
fresh
brown
stain
which
is
probably
blood
why
is
the
other
cushion
torn
ricardo
had
a
momentary
thought
of
putting
down
yet
another
question
he
was
inclined
to
ask
whether
or
no
a
pot
of
cold
cream
had
disappeared
from
celia
harland
bedroom
but
he
remembered
that
hanaud
had
set
no
store
upon
that
incident
and
he
refrained
moreover
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
sheet
of
paper
he
handed
it
across
the
table
to
hanaud
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
watching
the
detective
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
young
author
submitting
his
first
effort
to
a
critic
hanaud
read
it
through
slowly
at
the
end
he
nodded
his
head
in
approval
now
we
will
see
what
wethermill
has
to
say
he
said
and
he
stretched
out
the
paper
towards
harry
wethermill
who
throughout
the
luncheon
had
not
said
a
word
no
no
cried
ricardo
but
harry
wethermill
already
held
the
written
sheet
in
his
hand
he
smiled
rather
wistfully
at
his
friend
it
is
best
that
i
should
know
just
what
you
both
think
he
said
and
in
his
turn
he
began
to
read
the
paper
through
he
read
the
first
eight
points
and
then
beat
with
his
fist
upon
the
table
no
no
he
cried
it
is
not
possible
i
do
blame
you
ricardo
these
are
facts
and
as
i
said
i
can
face
facts
but
there
will
be
an
explanation
if
only
we
can
discover
it
he
buried
his
face
for
a
moment
in
his
hands
then
he
took
up
the
paper
again
as
for
the
rest
helene
vauquier
lied
he
cried
violently
and
he
tossed
the
paper
to
hanaud
what
do
you
make
of
it
hanaud
smiled
and
shook
his
head
did
you
ever
go
for
a
voyage
on
a
ship
he
asked
yes
why
because
every
day
at
noon
three
officers
take
an
observation
to
determine
the
ship
position
the
captain
the
first
officer
and
the
second
officer
each
writes
his
observation
down
and
the
captain
takes
the
three
observations
and
compares
them
if
the
first
or
second
officer
is
out
in
his
reckoning
the
captain
tells
him
so
but
he
does
not
show
his
own
for
at
times
no
doubt
he
is
wrong
too
so
gentlemen
i
criticise
your
observations
but
i
do
not
show
you
mine
he
took
up
ricardo
paper
and
read
it
through
again
yes
he
said
pleasantly
but
the
two
questions
which
are
most
important
which
alone
can
lead
us
to
the
truth
how
do
they
come
to
be
omitted
from
your
list
mr
ricardo
hanaud
put
the
question
with
his
most
serious
air
but
ricardo
was
none
the
less
sensible
of
the
raillery
behind
the
solemn
manner
he
flushed
and
made
no
answer
still
continued
hanaud
here
are
undoubtedly
some
questions
let
us
consider
them
who
was
the
man
who
took
a
part
in
the
crime
ah
if
we
only
knew
that
what
a
lot
of
trouble
we
should
save
ourselves
who
was
the
woman
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
to
know
that
too
how
clearly
after
all
ricardo
puts
his
finger
on
the
important
points
what
did
actually
happen
in
the
salon
and
as
he
quoted
that
question
the
raillery
died
out
of
his
voice
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
bent
forward
what
did
actually
happen
in
that
little
pretty
room
just
twelve
hours
ago
he
repeated
when
no
sunlight
blazed
upon
the
lawn
and
all
the
birds
were
still
and
all
the
windows
shuttered
and
the
world
dark
what
happened
what
dreadful
things
happened
we
have
not
much
to
go
upon
let
us
formulate
what
we
know
we
start
with
this
the
murder
was
not
the
work
of
a
moment
it
was
planned
with
great
care
and
cunning
and
carried
out
to
the
letter
of
the
plan
there
must
be
no
noise
no
violence
on
each
side
of
the
villa
rose
there
are
other
villas
a
few
yards
away
the
road
runs
past
a
scream
a
cry
the
noise
of
a
struggle
these
sounds
or
any
one
of
them
might
be
fatal
to
success
thus
the
crime
was
planned
and
there
was
no
scream
there
was
no
struggle
not
a
chair
was
broken
and
only
a
chair
upset
yes
there
were
brains
behind
that
murder
we
know
that
but
what
do
we
know
of
the
plan
how
far
can
we
build
it
up
let
us
see
first
there
was
an
accomplice
in
the
house
perhaps
two
no
cried
harry
wethermill
hanaud
took
no
notice
of
the
interruption
secondly
the
woman
came
to
the
house
with
mme
dauvray
and
mlle
celie
between
nine
and
nine
thirdly
the
man
came
afterwards
but
before
eleven
set
open
the
gate
and
was
admitted
into
the
salon
unperceived
by
mme
dauvray
that
also
we
can
safely
assume
but
what
happened
in
the
salon
ah
there
is
the
question
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
with
the
note
of
raillery
once
more
in
his
voice
but
why
should
we
trouble
our
heads
to
puzzle
out
this
mystery
since
ricardo
knows
i
cried
ricardo
in
amazement
to
be
sure
replied
hanaud
calmly
for
i
look
at
another
of
your
questions
did
the
scrap
of
writing
mean
and
you
add
then
there
was
a
seance
held
last
night
in
the
little
salon
is
that
so
harry
wethermill
started
ricardo
was
at
a
loss
i
had
not
followed
my
suggestion
to
its
conclusion
he
admitted
humbly
no
said
hanaud
but
i
ask
myself
in
sober
earnest
there
a
seance
held
in
the
salon
last
night
did
the
tambourine
rattle
in
the
darkness
on
the
wall
but
if
helene
vauquier
story
is
all
untrue
cried
wethermill
again
in
exasperation
patience
my
friend
her
story
was
not
all
untrue
i
say
there
were
brains
behind
this
crime
yes
but
brains
even
the
cleverest
would
not
have
invented
this
queer
strange
story
of
the
seances
and
of
mme
de
montespan
that
is
truth
but
yet
if
there
were
a
seance
held
if
the
scrap
of
paper
were
in
answer
to
some
awkward
question
why
and
here
i
come
to
my
first
question
which
ricardo
has
omitted
why
did
mlle
celie
dress
herself
with
so
much
elegance
last
night
what
vauquier
said
is
true
her
dress
was
not
suited
to
a
seance
a
rustling
frock
which
would
be
visible
in
a
dim
light
or
even
in
the
dark
which
would
certainly
be
heard
at
every
movement
she
made
however
lightly
she
stepped
and
a
big
hat
no
no
i
tell
you
gentlemen
we
shall
not
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
until
we
know
why
mlle
celie
dressed
herself
as
she
did
last
night
yes
ricardo
admitted
i
overlooked
that
point
did
she
hanaud
broke
off
and
bowed
to
wethermill
with
a
grace
and
a
respect
which
condoned
his
words
you
must
bear
with
me
my
young
friend
while
i
consider
all
these
points
did
she
expect
to
join
that
night
a
lover
a
man
with
the
brains
to
devise
this
crime
but
if
so
and
here
i
come
to
the
second
question
omitted
from
ricardo
list
why
on
the
patch
of
grass
outside
the
door
of
the
salon
were
the
footsteps
of
the
man
and
woman
so
carefully
erased
and
the
footsteps
of
mlle
celie
those
little
footsteps
so
easily
identified
left
for
all
the
world
to
see
and
recognise
ricardo
felt
like
a
child
in
the
presence
of
his
schoolmaster
he
was
convicted
of
presumption
he
had
set
down
his
questions
with
the
belief
that
they
covered
the
ground
and
here
were
two
of
the
utmost
importance
not
forgotten
but
never
even
thought
of
did
she
go
before
the
murder
to
join
a
lover
or
after
it
at
some
time
you
will
remember
according
to
vauquier
story
she
must
have
run
upstairs
to
fetch
her
coat
was
the
murder
committed
during
the
interval
when
she
was
upstairs
was
the
salon
dark
when
she
came
down
again
did
she
run
through
it
quickly
eagerly
noticing
nothing
amiss
and
indeed
how
should
she
notice
anything
if
the
salon
were
dark
and
mme
dauvray
body
lay
under
the
windows
at
the
side
ricardo
leaned
forward
eagerly
that
must
be
the
truth
he
cried
and
wethermill
voice
broke
hastily
in
it
is
not
the
truth
and
i
will
tell
you
why
celia
harland
was
to
have
married
me
this
week
there
was
so
much
pain
and
misery
in
his
voice
that
ricardo
was
moved
as
he
had
seldom
been
wethermill
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
hanaud
shook
his
head
and
gazed
across
the
table
at
ricardo
with
an
expression
which
the
latter
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
lovers
were
impracticable
people
but
he
hanaud
he
knew
the
world
women
had
fooled
men
before
wethermill
snatched
his
hands
away
from
before
his
face
we
talk
theories
he
cried
desperately
of
what
may
have
happened
at
the
villa
but
we
are
not
by
one
inch
nearer
to
the
man
and
woman
who
committed
the
crime
it
is
for
them
we
have
to
search
yes
but
except
by
asking
ourselves
questions
how
shall
we
find
them
m
wethermill
said
hanaud
take
the
man
we
know
nothing
of
him
he
has
left
no
trace
look
at
this
town
of
aix
where
people
come
and
go
like
a
crowd
about
the
he
may
be
at
marseilles
he
may
be
in
this
very
room
where
we
are
taking
our
luncheon
how
shall
we
find
him
wethermill
nodded
his
head
in
a
despairing
assent
i
know
but
it
is
so
hard
to
sit
still
and
do
nothing
he
cried
yes
but
we
are
not
sitting
still
said
hanaud
and
wethermill
looked
up
with
a
sudden
interest
all
the
time
that
we
have
been
lunching
here
the
intelligent
perrichet
has
been
making
inquiries
mme
dauvray
and
mlle
celie
left
the
villa
rose
at
five
and
returned
on
foot
soon
after
nine
with
the
strange
woman
and
there
i
see
perrichet
himself
waiting
to
be
summoned
hanaud
beckoned
towards
the
perrichet
will
make
an
excellent
detective
he
said
for
he
looks
more
bovine
and
foolish
in
plain
clothes
than
he
does
in
uniform
perrichet
advanced
in
his
mufti
to
the
table
speak
my
friend
said
hanaud
i
went
to
the
shop
of
corval
mlle
celie
was
quite
alone
when
she
bought
the
cord
but
a
few
minutes
later
in
the
rue
du
casino
she
and
mme
dauvray
were
seen
together
walking
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
villa
no
other
woman
was
with
them
that
is
a
pity
said
hanaud
quietly
and
with
a
gesture
he
dismissed
perrichet
you
see
we
shall
find
out
nothing
nothing
said
wethermill
with
a
groan
we
must
not
yet
lose
heart
for
we
know
a
little
more
about
the
woman
than
we
do
about
the
man
said
hanaud
consolingly
true
exclaimed
ricardo
we
have
helene
vauquier
description
of
her
we
must
advertise
it
hanaud
smiled
but
that
is
a
fine
suggestion
he
cried
we
must
think
over
that
and
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
with
a
gesture
of
why
did
not
such
a
fine
idea
occur
to
me
fool
that
i
am
however
we
will
call
the
head
waiter
the
head
waiter
was
sent
for
and
appeared
before
them
you
knew
mme
dauvray
hanaud
asked
yes
monsieur
oh
the
poor
woman
and
he
flung
up
his
hands
and
you
knew
her
young
companion
oh
yes
monsieur
they
generally
had
their
meals
here
see
at
that
little
table
over
there
i
kept
it
for
them
but
monsieur
knows
well
and
the
waiter
looked
towards
harry
wethermill
for
monsieur
was
often
with
them
yes
said
hanaud
did
mme
dauvray
dine
at
that
little
table
last
night
no
monsieur
she
was
not
here
last
night
nor
mlle
celie
no
monsieur
i
do
not
think
they
were
in
the
villa
des
fleurs
at
all
we
know
they
were
not
exclaimed
ricardo
wethermill
and
i
were
in
the
rooms
and
we
did
not
see
them
but
perhaps
you
left
early
objected
hanaud
no
said
ricardo
it
was
just
ten
when
we
reached
the
majestic
you
reached
your
hotel
at
ten
hanaud
repeated
did
you
walk
straight
from
here
yes
then
you
left
here
about
a
quarter
to
ten
and
we
know
that
mme
dauvray
was
back
at
the
villa
soon
after
nine
yes
they
could
not
have
been
here
last
night
hanaud
agreed
and
sat
for
a
moment
silent
then
he
turned
to
the
head
waiter
have
you
noticed
any
woman
with
mme
dauvray
and
her
companion
lately
no
monsieur
i
do
not
think
so
think
a
woman
for
instance
with
red
hair
harry
wethermill
started
forward
ricardo
stared
at
hanaud
in
amazement
the
waiter
reflected
no
monsieur
i
have
seen
no
woman
with
red
hair
thank
you
said
hanaud
and
the
waiter
moved
away
a
woman
with
red
hair
cried
wethermill
but
helene
vauquier
described
her
she
was
sallow
her
eyes
her
hair
were
dark
hanaud
turned
with
a
smile
to
harry
wethermill
did
helene
vauquier
then
speak
the
truth
he
asked
no
the
woman
who
was
in
the
salon
last
night
who
returned
home
with
mme
dauvray
and
mlle
celie
was
not
a
woman
with
black
hair
and
bright
black
eyes
look
and
fetching
his
from
his
pocket
he
unfolded
a
sheet
of
paper
and
showed
them
lying
upon
its
white
surface
a
long
red
hair
i
picked
that
up
on
the
table
the
round
satinwood
table
in
the
salon
it
was
easy
not
to
see
it
but
i
did
see
it
now
that
is
not
mlle
celie
hair
which
is
fair
nor
mme
dauvray
which
is
dyed
brown
nor
helene
vauquier
which
is
black
nor
the
charwoman
which
as
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
find
out
is
grey
it
is
therefore
from
the
head
of
our
unknown
woman
and
i
will
tell
you
more
this
woman
with
the
red
hair
she
is
in
geneva
a
startled
exclamation
burst
from
ricardo
harry
wethermill
sat
slowly
down
for
the
first
time
that
day
there
had
come
some
colour
into
his
cheeks
a
sparkle
into
his
eye
but
that
is
wonderful
he
cried
how
did
you
find
that
out
hanaud
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
took
a
pull
at
his
cigar
he
was
obviously
pleased
with
wethermill
admiration
yes
how
did
you
find
it
out
ricardo
repeated
hanaud
smiled
as
to
that
he
said
remember
i
am
the
captain
of
the
ship
and
i
do
not
show
you
my
observation
ricardo
was
disappointed
harry
wethermill
however
started
to
his
feet
we
must
search
geneva
then
he
cried
it
is
there
that
we
should
be
not
here
drinking
our
coffee
at
the
villa
des
fleurs
hanaud
raised
his
hand
the
search
is
not
being
overlooked
but
geneva
is
a
big
city
it
is
not
easy
to
search
geneva
and
find
when
we
know
nothing
about
the
woman
for
whom
we
are
searching
except
that
her
hair
is
red
and
that
probably
a
young
girl
last
night
was
with
her
it
is
rather
here
i
think
in
aix
that
we
must
keep
our
eyes
wide
open
here
cried
wethermill
in
exasperation
he
stared
at
hanaud
as
though
he
were
mad
yes
here
at
the
post
office
at
the
telephone
exchange
suppose
that
the
man
is
in
aix
as
he
may
well
be
some
time
he
will
wish
to
send
a
letter
or
a
telegram
or
a
message
over
the
telephone
that
i
tell
you
is
our
chance
but
here
is
news
for
us
hanaud
pointed
to
a
messenger
who
was
walking
towards
them
the
man
handed
hanaud
an
envelope
from
le
commissaire
he
said
and
he
saluted
and
retired
from
le
commissaire
cried
ricardo
excitedly
but
before
hanaud
could
open
the
envelope
harry
wethermill
laid
a
hand
upon
his
sleeve
before
we
pass
to
something
new
hanaud
he
said
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
tell
me
what
made
you
shiver
in
the
salon
this
morning
it
has
distressed
me
ever
since
what
was
it
that
those
two
cushions
had
to
tell
you
there
was
a
note
of
anguish
in
his
voice
difficult
to
resist
but
hanaud
resisted
it
he
shook
his
head
again
he
said
gravely
i
am
to
remind
you
that
i
am
captain
of
the
ship
and
do
not
show
my
observation
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
sprang
up
from
his
seat
mme
dauvray
has
been
found
he
cried
let
us
go
hanaud
called
for
the
bill
and
paid
it
the
three
men
left
the
villa
des
fleurs
together
chapter
ix
mme
dauvray
they
got
into
a
cab
outside
the
door
perrichet
mounted
the
box
and
the
cab
was
driven
along
the
road
past
the
hotel
bernascon
a
hundred
yards
beyond
the
hotel
the
cab
stopped
opposite
to
a
villa
a
hedge
separated
the
garden
of
the
villa
from
the
road
and
above
the
hedge
rose
a
board
with
the
words
to
let
upon
it
at
the
gate
a
gendarme
was
standing
and
just
within
the
gate
ricardo
saw
louis
besnard
the
commissaire
and
servettaz
mme
dauvray
chauffeur
it
is
here
said
besnard
as
the
party
descended
from
the
cab
in
the
of
this
empty
villa
here
cried
ricardo
in
amazement
the
discovery
upset
all
his
theories
he
had
expected
to
hear
that
it
had
been
found
fifty
leagues
away
but
here
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
the
villa
rose
itself
the
idea
seemed
absurd
why
take
it
away
at
all
unless
it
was
taken
away
as
a
blind
that
supposition
found
its
way
into
ricardo
mind
and
gathered
strength
as
he
thought
upon
it
for
hanaud
had
seemed
to
lean
to
the
belief
that
one
of
the
murderers
might
be
still
in
aix
indeed
a
glance
at
him
showed
that
he
was
not
discomposed
by
their
discovery
when
was
it
found
hanaud
asked
this
morning
a
gardener
comes
to
the
villa
on
two
days
a
week
to
keep
the
grounds
in
order
fortunately
wednesday
is
one
of
his
days
fortunately
too
there
was
rain
yesterday
evening
he
noticed
the
tracks
of
the
wheels
which
you
can
see
on
the
gravel
and
since
the
villa
is
empty
he
was
surprised
he
found
the
door
forced
and
the
inside
it
when
he
went
to
his
luncheon
he
brought
the
news
of
his
discovery
to
the
depot
the
party
followed
the
commissaire
along
the
drive
to
the
we
will
have
the
car
brought
out
said
hanaud
to
servettaz
it
was
a
big
and
powerful
machine
with
a
limousine
body
luxuriously
fitted
and
cushioned
in
the
shade
of
light
grey
the
outside
panels
of
the
car
were
painted
a
dark
grey
the
car
had
hardly
been
brought
out
into
the
sunlight
before
a
cry
of
stupefaction
burst
from
the
lips
of
perrichet
oh
he
cried
in
utter
abasement
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
never
never
why
hanaud
asked
turning
sharply
as
he
spoke
perrichet
was
standing
with
his
round
eyes
staring
and
his
mouth
agape
because
monsieur
i
saw
that
car
at
four
this
morning
at
the
corner
of
the
road
not
fifty
yards
from
the
villa
rose
what
cried
ricardo
you
saw
it
exclaimed
wethermill
upon
their
faces
was
reflected
now
the
stupefaction
of
perrichet
but
you
must
have
made
a
mistake
said
the
commissaire
no
no
monsieur
perrichet
insisted
it
was
that
car
it
was
that
number
it
was
just
after
daylight
i
was
standing
outside
the
gate
of
the
villa
on
duty
where
le
commissaire
had
placed
me
the
car
appeared
at
the
corner
and
slackened
speed
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
going
to
turn
into
the
road
and
come
down
past
me
but
instead
the
driver
as
if
he
were
now
sure
of
his
way
put
the
car
at
its
top
speed
and
went
on
into
aix
was
any
one
inside
the
car
asked
hanaud
no
monsieur
it
was
empty
but
you
saw
the
driver
exclaimed
wethermill
yes
what
was
he
like
cried
the
commissaire
perrichet
shook
his
head
mournfully
he
wore
a
talc
mask
over
the
upper
part
of
his
face
and
had
a
little
black
moustache
and
was
dressed
in
a
heavy
of
blue
with
a
white
collar
that
is
my
coat
monsieur
said
servettaz
and
as
he
spoke
he
lifted
it
up
from
the
chauffeur
seat
it
is
mme
dauvray
livery
harry
wethermill
groaned
aloud
we
have
lost
him
he
was
within
our
grasp
he
the
murderer
and
he
was
allowed
to
go
perrichet
grief
was
pitiable
monsieur
he
pleaded
a
car
slackens
its
speed
and
goes
on
again
it
is
not
so
unusual
a
thing
i
did
not
know
the
number
of
mme
car
i
did
not
even
know
that
it
had
disappeared
and
suddenly
tears
of
mortification
filled
his
eyes
but
why
do
i
make
these
excuses
he
cried
it
is
better
hanaud
that
i
go
back
to
my
uniform
and
stand
at
the
street
corner
i
am
as
foolish
as
i
look
nonsense
my
friend
said
hanaud
clapping
the
disconsolate
man
upon
the
shoulder
you
remembered
the
car
and
its
number
that
is
something
and
perhaps
a
great
deal
he
added
gravely
as
for
the
talc
mask
and
the
black
moustache
that
is
not
much
to
help
us
it
is
true
he
looked
at
ricardo
crestfallen
face
and
smiled
we
might
arrest
our
good
friend
ricardo
upon
that
evidence
but
no
one
else
that
i
know
hanaud
laughed
immoderately
at
his
joke
he
alone
seemed
to
feel
no
disappointment
at
perrichet
oversight
ricardo
was
a
little
touchy
on
the
subject
of
his
personal
appearance
and
bridled
visibly
hanaud
turned
towards
servettaz
now
he
said
you
know
how
much
petrol
was
taken
from
the
garage
yes
monsieur
can
you
tell
me
by
the
amount
which
has
been
used
how
far
that
car
was
driven
last
night
hanaud
asked
servettaz
examined
the
tank
a
long
way
monsieur
from
a
hundred
and
thirty
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
kilometres
i
should
say
yes
just
about
that
distance
i
should
say
cried
hanaud
his
eyes
brightened
and
a
smile
a
rather
fierce
smile
came
to
his
lips
he
opened
the
door
and
examined
with
a
minute
scrutiny
the
floor
of
the
carriage
and
as
he
looked
the
smile
faded
from
his
face
perplexity
returned
to
it
he
took
the
cushions
looked
them
over
and
shook
them
out
i
see
no
sign
he
began
and
then
he
uttered
a
little
shrill
cry
of
satisfaction
from
the
crack
of
the
door
by
the
hinge
he
picked
off
a
tiny
piece
of
pale
green
stuff
which
he
spread
out
upon
the
back
of
his
hand
tell
me
what
is
this
he
said
to
ricardo
it
is
a
green
fabric
said
ricardo
very
wisely
it
is
green
chiffon
said
hanaud
and
the
frock
in
which
mlle
celie
went
away
was
of
green
chiffon
over
satin
yes
mlle
celie
travelled
in
this
car
he
hurried
to
the
driver
seat
upon
the
floor
there
was
some
dark
mould
hanaud
cleaned
it
off
with
his
knife
and
held
some
of
it
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
turned
to
servettaz
you
drove
the
car
on
tuesday
morning
before
you
went
to
chambery
yes
monsieur
where
did
you
take
up
mme
dauvray
and
mlle
celie
at
the
front
door
of
the
villa
rose
did
you
get
down
from
the
seat
at
all
no
monsieur
not
after
i
left
the
garage
hanaud
returned
to
his
companions
see
and
he
opened
his
hand
this
is
black
soil
moist
from
last
night
rain
soil
like
the
soil
in
front
of
mme
dauvray
salon
look
here
is
even
a
blade
or
two
of
the
grass
and
he
turned
the
mould
over
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
then
he
took
an
empty
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
poured
the
soil
into
it
and
gummed
the
flap
down
he
stood
and
frowned
at
the
listen
he
said
how
i
am
puzzled
there
was
a
man
last
night
at
the
villa
rose
there
were
a
man
blurred
footmarks
in
the
mould
before
the
glass
door
that
man
drove
madame
car
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
kilometres
and
he
leaves
the
mould
which
clung
to
his
boots
upon
the
floor
of
his
seat
mlle
celie
and
another
woman
drove
away
inside
the
car
mlle
celie
leaves
a
fragment
of
the
chiffon
tunic
of
her
frock
which
caught
in
the
hinge
but
mlle
celie
made
much
clearer
impressions
in
the
mould
than
the
man
yet
on
the
floor
of
the
carriage
there
is
no
trace
of
her
shoes
again
i
say
there
is
something
here
which
i
do
not
understand
and
he
spread
out
his
hands
with
an
impulsive
gesture
of
despair
it
looks
as
if
they
had
been
careful
and
he
careless
said
ricardo
with
the
air
of
a
man
solving
a
very
difficult
problem
what
a
mind
cried
hanaud
now
clasping
his
hands
together
in
admiration
how
quick
and
how
profound
there
was
at
times
something
elephantinely
elfish
in
demeanour
which
left
ricardo
at
a
loss
but
he
had
come
to
notice
that
these
undignified
manifestations
usually
took
place
when
hanaud
had
reached
a
definite
opinion
upon
some
point
which
had
perplexed
him
yet
there
is
perhaps
another
explanation
hanaud
continued
for
observe
ricardo
we
have
other
evidence
to
show
that
the
careless
one
was
mlle
celie
it
was
she
who
left
her
footsteps
so
plainly
visible
upon
the
grass
not
the
man
however
we
will
go
back
to
wethermill
room
at
the
hotel
majestic
and
talk
this
matter
over
we
know
something
now
yes
we
know
what
do
we
know
monsieur
he
asked
suddenly
turning
with
a
smile
to
ricardo
and
as
ricardo
paused
think
it
over
while
we
walk
down
to
wethermill
apartment
in
the
hotel
majestic
we
know
that
the
murderer
has
escaped
replied
ricardo
hotly
the
murderer
is
not
now
the
most
important
object
of
our
search
he
is
very
likely
at
marseilles
by
now
we
shall
lay
our
hands
on
him
never
fear
replied
hanaud
with
a
superb
gesture
of
disdain
but
it
was
thoughtful
of
you
to
remind
me
of
him
i
might
so
easily
have
clean
forgotten
him
and
then
indeed
my
reputation
would
have
suffered
an
eclipse
he
made
a
low
ironical
bow
to
ricardo
and
walked
quickly
down
the
road
for
a
cumbersome
man
he
is
extraordinarily
active
said
ricardo
to
harry
wethermill
trying
to
laugh
without
much
success
a
heavy
clever
man
liable
to
become
a
little
at
a
moment
notice
thus
he
described
the
great
detective
and
the
description
is
quoted
for
it
was
ricardo
best
effort
in
the
whole
of
this
business
the
three
men
went
straight
to
harry
wethermill
apartment
which
consisted
of
a
and
a
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
a
balcony
ran
along
outside
hanaud
stepped
out
on
to
it
looked
about
him
and
returned
it
is
as
well
to
know
that
we
can
not
be
overheard
he
said
harry
wethermill
meanwhile
had
thrown
himself
into
a
chair
the
mask
he
had
worn
had
slipped
from
its
fastenings
for
a
moment
there
was
a
look
of
infinite
suffering
upon
his
face
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
tortured
by
misery
to
the
hanaud
on
the
other
hand
was
particularly
alert
the
discovery
of
the
had
raised
his
spirits
he
sat
at
the
table
i
will
tell
you
what
we
have
learnt
he
said
and
it
is
of
importance
the
three
of
them
the
man
the
woman
with
the
red
hair
and
mlle
celie
all
drove
yesterday
night
to
geneva
that
is
only
one
thing
we
have
learnt
then
you
still
cling
to
geneva
said
ricardo
more
than
ever
said
hanaud
he
turned
in
his
chair
towards
wethermill
ah
my
poor
friend
he
said
when
he
saw
the
young
man
distress
harry
wethermill
sprang
up
with
a
gesture
as
though
to
sweep
the
need
of
sympathy
away
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
you
have
a
road
map
perhaps
said
hanaud
yes
said
wethermill
mine
is
here
there
it
is
and
crossing
the
room
he
brought
it
from
a
sidetable
and
placed
it
in
front
of
hanaud
hanaud
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
one
hundred
and
fifty
kilometres
was
about
the
distance
which
the
car
had
travelled
measure
the
distances
here
and
you
will
see
that
geneva
is
the
likely
place
it
is
a
good
city
to
hide
in
moreover
the
car
appears
at
the
corner
at
daylight
how
does
it
appear
there
what
road
is
it
which
comes
out
at
that
corner
the
road
from
geneva
i
am
not
sorry
that
it
is
geneva
for
the
chef
de
la
surete
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
what
else
do
we
know
asked
ricardo
this
said
hanaud
he
paused
impressively
bring
up
your
chair
to
the
table
wethermill
and
consider
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
and
he
waited
until
harry
wethermill
had
obeyed
then
he
laughed
in
a
friendly
way
at
himself
i
can
not
help
it
he
said
i
have
an
eye
for
dramatic
effects
i
must
prepare
for
them
when
i
know
they
are
coming
and
one
i
tell
you
is
coming
now
he
shook
his
finger
at
his
companions
ricardo
shifted
and
shuffled
in
his
chair
harry
wethermill
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
hanaud
face
but
he
was
quiet
as
he
had
been
throughout
the
long
inquiry
hanaud
lit
a
cigarette
and
took
his
time
what
i
think
is
this
the
man
who
drove
the
car
into
geneva
drove
it
back
because
he
meant
to
leave
it
again
in
the
garage
of
the
villa
rose
good
heavens
cried
ricardo
flinging
himself
back
the
theory
so
calmly
enunciated
took
his
breath
away
would
he
have
dared
asked
harry
wethermill
hanaud
leaned
across
and
tapped
his
fingers
on
the
table
to
emphasise
his
answer
all
through
this
crime
there
are
two
things
visible
brains
and
daring
clever
brains
and
extraordinary
daring
would
he
have
dared
he
dared
to
be
at
the
corner
close
to
the
villa
rose
at
daylight
why
else
should
he
have
returned
except
to
put
back
the
car
consider
the
petrol
is
taken
from
tins
which
servettaz
might
never
have
touched
for
a
fortnight
and
by
that
time
he
might
as
he
said
have
forgotten
whether
he
had
not
used
them
himself
i
had
this
possibility
in
my
mind
when
i
put
the
questions
to
servettaz
about
the
petrol
which
the
commissaire
thought
so
stupid
the
utmost
care
is
taken
that
there
shall
be
no
mould
left
on
the
floor
of
the
carriage
the
scrap
of
chiffon
was
torn
off
no
doubt
when
the
women
finally
left
the
car
and
therefore
not
noticed
or
that
too
would
have
been
removed
that
the
exterior
of
the
car
was
dirty
betrayed
nothing
for
servettaz
had
left
it
uncleaned
hanaud
leaned
back
and
step
by
step
related
the
journey
of
the
car
the
man
leaves
the
gate
open
he
drives
into
geneva
the
two
women
who
are
careful
that
their
shoes
shall
leave
no
marks
upon
the
floor
at
geneva
they
get
out
the
man
returns
if
he
can
only
leave
the
car
in
the
garage
he
covers
all
traces
of
the
course
he
and
his
friends
have
taken
no
one
would
suspect
that
the
car
had
ever
left
the
garage
at
the
corner
of
the
road
just
as
he
is
turning
down
to
the
villa
he
sees
a
at
the
gate
he
knows
that
the
murder
is
discovered
he
puts
on
full
speed
and
goes
straight
out
of
the
town
what
is
he
to
do
he
is
driving
a
car
for
which
the
police
in
an
hour
or
two
if
not
now
already
will
be
surely
watching
he
is
driving
it
in
broad
daylight
he
must
get
rid
of
it
and
at
once
before
people
are
about
to
see
it
and
to
see
him
in
it
imagine
his
feelings
it
is
almost
enough
to
make
one
pity
him
here
he
is
in
a
car
which
convicts
him
as
a
murderer
and
he
has
nowhere
to
leave
it
he
drives
through
aix
then
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
finds
an
empty
villa
he
drives
in
at
the
gate
forces
the
door
of
the
and
leaves
his
car
there
now
observe
it
is
no
longer
any
use
for
him
to
pretend
that
he
and
his
friends
did
not
disappear
in
that
car
the
murder
is
already
discovered
and
with
the
murder
the
disappearance
of
the
car
so
he
no
longer
troubles
his
head
about
it
he
does
not
remove
the
traces
of
mould
from
the
place
where
his
feet
rested
which
otherwise
no
doubt
he
would
have
done
it
no
longer
matters
he
has
to
run
to
earth
now
before
he
is
seen
that
is
all
his
business
and
so
the
state
of
the
car
is
explained
it
was
a
bold
step
to
bring
that
car
back
yes
a
bold
and
desperate
step
but
a
clever
one
for
if
it
had
succeeded
we
should
have
known
nothing
of
their
movements
oh
but
nothing
nothing
ah
i
tell
you
this
is
no
ordinary
blundering
affair
they
are
clever
people
who
devised
this
crime
clever
and
of
an
audacity
which
is
surprising
then
hanaud
lit
another
cigarette
ricardo
on
the
other
hand
could
hardly
continue
to
smoke
for
excitement
i
can
not
understand
your
calmness
he
exclaimed
no
said
hanaud
yet
it
is
so
obvious
you
are
the
amateur
i
am
the
professional
that
is
all
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
rose
to
his
feet
i
must
go
he
said
and
as
he
turned
towards
the
door
a
cry
sprang
from
ricardo
lips
it
is
true
i
am
the
amateur
yet
i
have
knowledge
monsieur
hanaud
which
the
professional
would
do
well
to
obtain
hanaud
turned
a
guarded
face
towards
ricardo
there
was
no
longer
any
raillery
in
his
manner
he
spoke
slowly
coldly
let
me
have
it
then
i
have
driven
in
my
from
geneva
to
aix
ricardo
cried
excitedly
a
bridge
crosses
a
ravine
high
up
amongst
the
mountains
at
the
bridge
there
is
a
custom
house
there
at
the
pont
de
la
caille
your
car
is
stopped
it
is
searched
you
must
sign
your
name
in
a
book
and
there
is
no
way
round
you
would
find
sure
and
certain
proof
whether
or
no
madame
dauvray
car
travelled
last
night
to
geneva
not
so
many
travellers
pass
along
that
road
at
night
you
would
find
certain
proof
too
of
how
many
people
were
in
the
car
for
they
search
carefully
at
the
pont
de
la
caille
a
dark
flush
overspread
hanaud
face
ricardo
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
he
had
at
last
contributed
something
to
the
history
of
this
crime
he
had
repaired
an
omission
he
had
supplied
knowledge
to
the
omniscient
wethermill
looked
up
drearily
like
one
who
has
lost
heart
yes
you
must
not
neglect
that
clue
he
said
hanaud
replied
testily
it
is
not
a
clue
ricardo
tells
that
he
travelled
from
geneva
into
france
and
that
his
car
was
searched
well
we
know
already
that
the
officers
are
particular
at
the
custom
houses
of
france
but
travelling
from
france
into
switzerland
is
a
very
different
affair
in
switzerland
hardly
a
glance
hardly
a
word
that
was
true
ricardo
crestfallen
recognized
the
truth
but
his
spirits
rose
again
at
once
but
the
car
came
back
from
geneva
into
france
he
cried
yes
but
when
the
car
came
back
the
man
was
alone
in
it
hanaud
answered
i
have
more
important
things
to
attend
to
for
instance
i
must
know
whether
by
any
chance
they
have
caught
our
man
at
marseilles
he
laid
his
hand
on
wethermill
shoulder
and
you
my
friend
i
should
counsel
you
to
get
some
sleep
we
may
need
all
our
strength
i
hope
so
he
was
speaking
very
bravely
yes
i
hope
so
wethermill
nodded
i
shall
try
he
said
that
better
said
hanaud
cheerfully
you
will
both
stay
here
this
evening
for
if
i
have
news
i
can
then
ring
you
up
both
men
agreed
and
hanaud
went
away
he
left
ricardo
profoundly
disturbed
that
man
will
take
advice
from
no
one
he
declared
his
vanity
is
colossal
it
is
true
they
are
not
particular
at
the
swiss
frontier
still
the
car
would
have
to
stop
there
at
the
custom
house
they
would
know
something
hanaud
ought
to
make
inquiries
but
neither
ricardo
nor
harry
wethermill
heard
a
word
more
from
hanaud
that
night
chapter
x
news
from
geneva
the
next
morning
however
before
ricardo
was
out
of
his
bed
hanaud
was
announced
he
came
stepping
gaily
into
the
room
more
elephantinely
elfish
than
ever
send
your
valet
away
he
said
and
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
he
produced
a
newspaper
which
he
flourished
in
ricardo
face
and
then
dropped
into
his
hands
ricardo
saw
staring
him
in
the
face
a
full
description
of
celia
harland
of
her
appearance
and
her
dress
of
everything
except
her
name
coupled
with
an
intimation
that
a
reward
of
four
thousand
francs
would
be
paid
to
any
one
who
could
give
information
leading
to
the
discovery
of
her
whereabouts
to
ricardo
the
hotel
majestic
ricardo
sat
up
in
his
bed
with
a
sense
of
outrage
you
have
done
this
he
asked
yes
why
have
you
done
it
ricardo
cried
hanaud
advanced
to
the
bed
mysteriously
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
i
will
tell
you
he
said
in
his
most
confidential
tones
only
it
must
remain
a
secret
between
you
and
me
i
did
it
because
i
have
a
sense
of
humour
i
hate
publicity
said
ricardo
acidly
on
the
other
hand
you
have
four
thousand
francs
protested
the
detective
besides
what
else
should
i
do
if
i
name
myself
the
very
people
we
are
seeking
to
catch
who
you
may
be
sure
will
be
the
first
to
read
this
advertisement
will
know
that
i
the
great
the
incomparable
hanaud
am
after
them
and
i
do
not
want
them
to
know
that
besides
and
he
spoke
now
in
a
gentle
and
most
serious
voice
why
should
we
make
life
more
difficult
for
mlle
celie
by
telling
the
world
that
the
police
want
her
it
will
be
time
enough
for
that
when
she
appears
before
the
juge
ricardo
grumbled
inarticulately
and
read
through
the
advertisement
again
besides
your
description
is
incomplete
he
said
there
is
no
mention
of
the
diamond
earrings
which
celia
harland
was
wearing
when
she
went
away
ah
so
you
noticed
that
exclaimed
hanaud
a
little
more
experience
and
i
should
be
looking
very
closely
to
my
laurels
but
as
for
the
earrings
i
will
tell
you
mlle
celie
was
not
wearing
them
when
she
went
away
from
the
villa
rose
but
but
stammered
ricardo
the
case
upon
the
table
was
empty
still
she
was
not
wearing
them
i
know
said
hanaud
decisively
how
do
you
know
cried
ricardo
gazing
at
hanaud
with
awe
in
his
eyes
how
could
you
know
because
and
hanaud
struck
a
majestic
attitude
like
a
king
in
a
play
because
i
am
the
captain
of
the
ship
upon
that
ricardo
suffered
a
return
of
his
i
do
not
like
to
be
trifled
with
he
remarked
with
as
much
dignity
as
his
ruffled
hair
and
the
allowed
him
he
looked
sternly
at
the
newspaper
turning
it
over
and
then
he
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
but
this
is
yesterday
paper
he
said
yesterday
evening
paper
hanaud
corrected
printed
at
geneva
printed
and
published
and
sold
at
geneva
said
hanaud
when
did
you
send
the
advertisement
in
then
i
wrote
a
letter
while
we
were
taking
our
luncheon
hanaud
explained
the
letter
was
to
besnard
asking
him
to
telegraph
the
advertisement
at
once
but
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
to
us
ricardo
grumbled
no
and
was
i
not
wise
said
hanaud
with
complacency
for
you
would
have
forbidden
me
to
use
your
name
oh
i
do
go
so
far
as
that
said
ricardo
reluctantly
his
indignation
was
rapidly
evaporating
for
there
was
growing
up
in
his
mind
a
pleasant
perception
that
the
advertisement
placed
him
in
the
limelight
he
rose
from
his
bed
you
will
make
yourself
comfortable
in
the
while
i
have
my
bath
i
will
indeed
replied
hanaud
cheerily
i
have
already
ordered
my
morning
chocolate
i
have
hopes
that
you
may
have
a
telegram
very
soon
this
paper
was
cried
last
night
through
the
streets
of
geneva
ricardo
dressed
for
once
in
a
way
with
some
approach
to
ordinary
celerity
and
joined
hanaud
has
nothing
come
he
asked
no
this
chocolate
is
very
good
it
is
better
than
that
which
i
get
in
my
hotel
good
heavens
cried
ricardo
who
was
fairly
twittering
with
excitement
you
sit
there
talking
about
chocolate
while
my
cup
shakes
in
my
fingers
again
i
must
remind
you
that
you
are
the
amateur
i
the
professional
my
friend
as
the
morning
drew
on
however
hanaud
professional
quietude
deserted
him
he
began
to
start
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
corridor
to
glance
every
other
moment
from
the
window
to
eat
his
cigarettes
rather
than
to
smoke
them
at
eleven
ricardo
valet
brought
a
telegram
into
the
room
ricardo
seized
it
calmly
my
friend
said
hanaud
with
trembling
fingers
ricardo
tore
it
open
he
jumped
in
his
chair
speechless
he
handed
the
telegram
to
hanaud
it
had
been
sent
from
geneva
and
it
ran
thus
expect
me
soon
after
marthe
gobin
hanaud
nodded
his
head
i
told
you
i
had
hopes
all
his
levity
had
gone
in
an
instant
from
his
manner
he
spoke
very
quietly
i
had
better
send
for
wethermill
asked
ricardo
hanaud
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
you
like
but
why
raise
hopes
in
that
poor
man
breast
which
an
hour
or
two
may
dash
for
ever
to
the
ground
consider
marthe
gobin
has
something
to
tell
us
think
over
those
eight
points
of
evidence
which
you
drew
up
yesterday
in
the
villa
des
fleurs
and
say
whether
what
she
has
to
tell
us
is
more
likely
to
prove
mlle
celie
innocence
than
her
guilt
think
well
for
i
will
be
guided
by
you
ricardo
said
hanaud
solemnly
if
you
think
it
better
that
your
friend
should
live
in
torture
until
marthe
gobin
comes
and
then
perhaps
suffer
worse
torture
from
the
news
she
brings
be
it
so
you
shall
decide
if
on
the
other
hand
you
think
it
will
be
best
to
leave
wethermill
in
peace
until
we
know
her
story
be
it
so
you
shall
decide
ricardo
moved
uneasily
the
solemnity
of
hanaud
manner
impressed
him
he
had
no
wish
to
take
the
responsibility
of
the
decision
upon
himself
but
hanaud
sat
with
his
eyes
strangely
fixed
upon
ricardo
waiting
for
his
answer
well
said
ricardo
at
length
good
news
will
be
none
the
worse
for
waiting
a
few
hours
bad
news
will
be
a
little
the
better
yes
said
hanaud
so
i
thought
you
would
decide
he
took
up
a
continental
bradshaw
from
a
bookshelf
in
the
room
from
geneva
she
will
come
through
culoz
let
us
see
he
turned
over
the
pages
there
is
a
train
from
culoz
which
reaches
aix
at
seven
minutes
past
three
it
is
by
that
train
she
will
come
you
have
a
yes
very
well
will
you
pick
me
up
in
it
at
three
at
my
hotel
we
will
drive
down
to
the
station
and
see
the
arrivals
by
that
train
it
may
help
us
to
get
some
idea
of
the
person
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
that
is
always
an
advantage
now
i
will
leave
you
for
i
have
much
to
do
but
i
will
look
in
upon
wethermill
as
i
go
down
and
tell
him
that
there
is
as
yet
no
news
he
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
stood
for
a
moment
staring
out
of
the
window
then
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
with
a
start
you
look
out
upon
mont
revard
i
see
i
think
wethermill
view
over
the
garden
and
the
town
is
the
better
one
he
said
and
went
out
of
the
room
at
three
ricardo
called
in
his
car
which
was
an
open
car
of
high
power
at
hanaud
hotel
and
the
two
men
went
to
the
station
they
waited
outside
the
exit
while
the
passengers
gave
up
their
tickets
amongst
them
a
short
woman
of
a
plethoric
tendency
attracted
their
notice
she
was
neatly
but
shabbily
dressed
in
black
her
gloves
were
darned
and
she
was
obviously
in
a
hurry
as
she
came
out
she
asked
a
commissionaire
how
far
is
it
to
the
hotel
majestic
the
man
told
her
the
hotel
was
at
the
very
top
of
the
town
and
the
way
was
steep
but
madame
can
go
up
in
the
omnibus
of
the
hotel
he
suggested
madame
however
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
the
omnibus
would
have
to
wait
for
luggage
she
hailed
a
closed
cab
and
drove
off
inside
it
now
if
we
go
back
in
the
car
we
shall
be
all
ready
for
her
when
she
arrives
said
hanaud
they
passed
the
cab
indeed
a
few
yards
up
the
steep
hill
which
leads
from
the
station
the
cab
was
moving
at
a
walk
she
looks
honest
said
hanaud
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
is
some
good
bourgeoise
anxious
to
earn
four
thousand
francs
they
reached
the
hotel
in
a
few
minutes
we
may
need
your
car
again
the
moment
marthe
gobin
has
gone
said
hanaud
it
shall
wait
here
said
ricardo
no
said
hanaud
let
it
wait
in
the
little
street
at
the
back
of
my
hotel
it
will
not
be
so
noticeable
there
you
have
petrol
for
a
long
journey
ricardo
gave
the
order
quietly
to
his
chauffeur
and
followed
hanaud
into
the
hotel
through
a
glass
window
they
could
see
wethermill
smoking
a
cigar
over
his
coffee
he
looks
as
if
he
had
not
slept
said
ricardo
hanaud
nodded
sympathetically
and
beckoned
ricardo
past
the
window
but
we
are
nearing
the
end
these
two
days
have
been
for
him
days
of
great
trouble
one
can
see
that
very
clearly
and
he
has
done
nothing
to
embarrass
us
men
in
distress
are
apt
to
be
a
nuisance
i
am
grateful
to
wethermill
but
we
are
nearing
the
end
who
knows
within
an
hour
or
two
we
may
have
news
for
him
he
spoke
with
great
feeling
and
the
two
men
ascended
the
stairs
to
ricardo
rooms
for
the
second
time
that
day
hanaud
professional
calm
deserted
him
the
window
overlooked
the
main
entrance
to
the
hotel
hanaud
arranged
the
room
and
even
while
he
arranged
it
ran
every
other
second
and
leaned
from
the
window
to
watch
for
the
coming
of
the
cab
put
the
upon
the
table
he
said
hurriedly
they
will
persuade
her
to
tell
us
all
that
she
has
to
tell
yes
that
will
do
she
is
not
in
sight
yet
no
she
could
not
be
it
is
a
long
way
from
the
station
said
ricardo
and
the
whole
distance
is
uphill
yes
that
is
true
hanaud
replied
we
will
not
embarrass
her
by
sitting
round
the
table
like
a
tribunal
you
will
sit
in
that
ricardo
took
his
seat
crossed
his
knees
and
joined
the
tips
of
his
fingers
so
not
too
judicial
said
hanaud
i
will
sit
here
at
the
table
whatever
you
do
do
not
frighten
her
hanaud
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
he
had
placed
for
himself
marthe
gobin
shall
sit
opposite
with
the
light
upon
her
face
so
and
springing
up
he
arranged
a
chair
for
her
whatever
you
do
do
not
frighten
her
he
repeated
i
am
nervous
so
much
depends
upon
this
interview
and
in
a
second
he
was
back
at
the
window
ricardo
did
not
move
he
arranged
in
his
mind
the
interrogatory
which
was
to
take
place
he
was
to
conduct
it
he
was
the
master
of
the
situation
all
the
limelight
was
to
be
his
startling
facts
would
come
to
light
elicited
by
his
deft
questions
hanaud
need
not
fear
he
would
not
frighten
her
he
would
be
gentle
he
would
be
cunning
softly
and
delicately
he
would
turn
this
good
woman
inside
out
like
a
glove
every
artistic
fibre
in
his
body
vibrated
to
the
dramatic
situation
suddenly
hanaud
leaned
out
of
the
window
it
comes
it
comes
he
said
in
a
quick
feverish
whisper
i
can
see
the
cab
between
the
shrubs
of
the
drive
let
it
come
said
ricardo
superbly
even
as
he
sat
he
could
hear
the
grating
of
wheels
upon
the
drive
he
saw
hanaud
lean
farther
from
the
window
and
stamp
impatiently
upon
the
floor
there
it
is
at
the
door
he
said
and
for
a
few
seconds
he
spoke
no
more
he
stood
looking
downwards
craning
his
head
with
his
back
towards
ricardo
then
with
a
wild
and
startled
cry
he
staggered
back
into
the
room
his
face
was
white
as
wax
his
eyes
full
of
horror
his
mouth
open
what
is
the
matter
exclaimed
ricardo
springing
to
his
feet
they
are
lifting
her
out
she
does
move
they
are
lifting
her
out
for
a
moment
he
stared
into
ricardo
face
paralysed
by
fear
then
he
sprang
down
the
stairs
ricardo
followed
him
there
was
confusion
in
the
corridor
men
were
running
voices
were
crying
questions
as
they
passed
the
window
they
saw
wethermill
start
up
aroused
from
his
lethargy
they
knew
the
truth
before
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
hotel
a
cab
had
driven
up
to
the
door
from
the
station
in
the
cab
was
an
unknown
woman
stabbed
to
the
heart
she
should
have
come
by
the
omnibus
hanaud
repeated
and
repeated
stupidly
for
the
moment
he
was
off
his
balance
chapter
xi
the
unopened
letter
the
hall
of
the
hotel
had
been
cleared
of
people
at
the
entrance
from
the
corridor
a
porter
barred
the
way
no
one
can
pass
said
he
i
think
that
i
can
said
hanaud
and
he
produced
his
card
from
the
surete
at
paris
he
was
allowed
to
enter
with
ricardo
at
his
heels
on
the
ground
lay
marthe
gobin
the
manager
of
the
hotel
stood
at
her
side
a
doctor
was
on
his
knees
hanaud
gave
his
card
to
the
manager
you
have
sent
word
to
the
police
yes
said
the
manager
and
the
wound
asked
hanaud
kneeling
on
the
ground
beside
the
doctor
it
was
a
very
small
wound
round
and
neat
and
clean
and
there
was
very
little
blood
it
was
made
by
a
bullet
said
hanaud
some
tiny
bullet
from
an
no
answered
the
doctor
no
knife
made
it
hanaud
asserted
that
is
true
said
the
doctor
look
and
he
took
up
from
the
floor
by
his
knee
the
weapon
which
had
caused
marthe
gobin
death
it
was
nothing
but
an
ordinary
skewer
with
a
ring
at
one
end
and
a
sharp
point
at
the
other
and
a
piece
of
common
white
firewood
for
a
handle
the
wood
had
been
split
the
ring
inserted
and
spliced
in
position
with
strong
twine
it
was
a
rough
enough
weapon
but
an
effective
one
the
proof
of
its
effectiveness
lay
stretched
upon
the
floor
beside
them
hanaud
gave
it
to
the
manager
of
the
hotel
you
must
be
very
careful
of
this
and
give
it
as
it
is
to
the
police
then
he
bent
once
more
over
marthe
gobin
did
she
suffer
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
no
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
said
the
doctor
i
am
glad
of
that
said
hanaud
as
he
rose
again
to
his
feet
in
the
doorway
the
driver
of
the
cab
was
standing
what
has
he
to
say
hanaud
asked
the
man
stepped
forward
instantly
he
was
an
old
stout
man
with
a
shiny
white
tall
hat
like
a
thousand
drivers
of
cabs
what
have
i
to
say
monsieur
he
grumbled
in
a
husky
voice
i
take
up
the
poor
woman
at
the
station
and
i
drive
her
where
she
bids
me
and
i
find
her
dead
and
my
day
is
lost
who
will
pay
my
fare
monsieur
i
will
said
hanaud
there
it
is
and
he
handed
the
man
a
piece
now
answer
me
do
you
tell
me
that
this
woman
was
murdered
in
your
cab
and
that
you
knew
nothing
about
it
but
what
should
i
know
i
take
her
up
at
the
station
and
all
the
way
up
the
hill
her
head
is
every
moment
out
of
the
window
crying
faster
oh
the
good
woman
was
in
a
hurry
but
for
me
i
take
no
notice
the
more
she
shouts
the
less
i
hear
i
bury
my
head
between
my
shoulders
and
i
look
ahead
of
me
and
i
take
no
notice
one
can
not
expect
to
run
up
these
hills
it
is
not
reasonable
so
you
went
at
a
walk
said
hanaud
he
beckoned
to
ricardo
and
said
to
the
manager
besnard
will
no
doubt
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
and
he
will
send
for
the
juge
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
do
he
went
back
to
ricardo
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
he
had
been
calm
enough
downstairs
in
the
presence
of
the
doctor
and
the
body
of
the
victim
now
with
only
ricardo
for
a
witness
he
gave
way
to
distress
it
is
terrible
he
said
the
poor
woman
it
was
i
who
brought
her
to
aix
it
was
through
my
carelessness
but
who
would
have
thought
he
snatched
his
hands
from
his
face
and
stood
up
i
should
have
thought
he
said
solemnly
extraordinary
daring
that
was
one
of
the
qualities
of
my
criminal
i
knew
it
and
i
disregarded
it
now
we
have
a
second
crime
the
skewer
may
lead
you
to
the
criminal
said
ricardo
the
skewer
cried
hanaud
how
will
that
help
us
a
knife
yes
perhaps
but
a
skewer
at
the
shops
there
will
not
be
so
many
in
aix
at
which
you
can
buy
skewers
they
may
remember
to
whom
they
sold
one
within
the
last
day
or
so
how
do
we
know
it
was
bought
in
the
last
day
or
so
cried
hanaud
scornfully
we
have
not
to
do
with
a
man
who
walks
into
a
shop
and
buys
a
single
skewer
to
commit
a
murder
with
and
so
hands
himself
over
to
the
police
how
often
must
i
say
it
the
violence
of
his
contempt
nettled
ricardo
if
the
murderer
did
not
buy
it
how
did
he
obtain
it
he
asked
obstinately
oh
my
friend
could
he
not
have
stolen
it
from
this
or
from
any
hotel
in
aix
would
the
loss
of
a
skewer
be
noticed
do
you
think
how
many
people
in
aix
have
had
rognons
a
la
brochette
for
their
luncheon
besides
it
is
not
merely
the
death
of
this
poor
woman
which
troubles
me
we
have
lost
the
evidence
which
she
was
going
to
bring
to
us
she
had
something
to
tell
us
about
celie
harland
which
now
we
shall
never
hear
we
have
to
begin
all
over
again
and
i
tell
you
we
have
not
the
time
to
begin
all
over
again
no
we
have
not
the
time
time
will
be
lost
and
we
have
no
time
to
lose
he
buried
his
face
again
in
his
hands
and
groaned
aloud
his
grief
was
so
violent
and
so
sincere
that
ricardo
shocked
as
he
was
by
the
murder
of
marthe
gobin
set
himself
to
console
him
but
you
could
not
have
foreseen
that
at
three
in
the
afternoon
at
aix
hanaud
brushed
the
excuse
aside
it
is
no
extenuation
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
oh
but
i
will
have
no
pity
now
he
cried
and
as
he
ended
the
words
abruptly
his
face
changed
he
lifted
a
trembling
forefinger
and
pointed
there
came
a
sudden
look
of
life
into
his
dull
and
despairing
eyes
he
was
pointing
to
a
on
which
were
piled
letters
you
have
not
opened
them
this
morning
he
asked
no
you
came
while
i
was
still
in
bed
i
have
not
thought
of
them
till
now
hanaud
crossed
to
the
table
and
looking
down
at
the
letters
uttered
a
cry
there
one
the
big
envelope
he
said
his
voice
shaking
like
his
hand
it
has
a
swiss
stamp
he
swallowed
to
moisten
his
throat
ricardo
sprang
across
the
room
and
tore
open
the
envelope
there
was
a
long
letter
enclosed
in
a
handwriting
unknown
to
him
he
read
aloud
the
first
lines
of
the
letter
i
write
what
i
saw
and
post
it
so
that
no
one
may
be
before
me
with
the
news
i
will
come
over
for
the
money
a
low
exclamation
from
hanaud
interrupted
the
words
the
signature
quick
ricardo
turned
to
the
end
of
the
letter
marthe
gobin
she
speaks
then
after
all
she
speaks
hanaud
whispered
in
a
voice
of
awe
he
ran
to
the
door
of
the
room
opened
it
suddenly
and
shutting
it
again
locked
it
quick
we
can
not
bring
that
poor
woman
back
to
life
but
we
may
still
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
he
took
the
letter
unceremoniously
from
ricardo
hand
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
over
his
shoulder
ricardo
too
read
marthe
letter
it
was
just
the
sort
of
letter
which
in
ricardo
view
marthe
gobin
would
have
written
a
long
straggling
letter
which
never
kept
to
the
point
which
exasperated
them
one
moment
by
its
folly
and
fired
them
to
excitement
the
next
it
was
dated
from
a
small
suburb
of
geneva
on
the
western
side
of
the
lake
and
it
ran
as
follows
the
suburb
is
but
a
street
close
to
the
and
a
tram
runs
into
the
city
it
is
quite
respectable
you
understand
monsieur
with
a
hotel
at
the
end
of
it
and
really
some
very
good
houses
but
i
do
not
wish
to
deceive
you
about
the
social
position
of
myself
or
my
husband
our
house
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
street
definitely
yes
it
is
a
small
house
and
we
do
not
see
the
water
from
any
of
the
windows
because
of
the
better
houses
opposite
gobin
my
husband
who
was
a
clerk
in
one
of
the
great
banks
in
geneva
broke
down
in
health
in
the
spring
and
for
the
last
three
months
has
been
compelled
to
keep
indoors
of
course
money
has
not
been
plentiful
and
i
could
not
afford
a
nurse
consequently
i
myself
have
been
compelled
to
nurse
him
monsieur
if
you
were
a
woman
you
would
know
what
men
are
when
they
are
ill
how
fretful
how
difficult
there
is
not
much
distraction
for
the
woman
who
nurses
them
so
as
i
am
in
the
house
most
of
the
day
i
find
what
amusement
i
can
in
watching
the
doings
of
my
neighbours
you
will
not
blame
me
a
month
ago
the
house
almost
directly
opposite
to
us
was
taken
furnished
for
the
summer
by
a
mme
rossignol
she
is
a
widow
but
during
the
last
fortnight
a
young
gentleman
has
come
several
times
in
the
afternoon
to
see
her
and
it
is
said
in
the
street
that
he
is
going
to
marry
her
but
i
can
not
believe
it
myself
monsieur
is
a
young
man
of
perhaps
thirty
with
smooth
black
hair
he
wears
a
moustache
a
little
black
moustache
and
is
altogether
captivating
mme
rossignol
is
five
or
six
years
older
i
should
think
a
tall
woman
with
red
hair
and
a
bold
sort
of
coarse
beauty
i
was
not
attracted
by
her
she
seemed
not
quite
of
the
same
world
as
that
charming
monsieur
who
was
said
to
be
going
to
marry
her
no
i
was
not
attracted
by
adele
rossignol
and
when
he
had
come
to
that
point
hanaud
looked
up
with
a
start
so
the
name
was
adele
he
whispered
yes
said
ricardo
helene
vauquier
spoke
the
truth
hanaud
nodded
with
a
queer
smile
upon
his
lips
yes
there
she
spoke
the
truth
i
thought
she
did
but
she
said
adele
hair
was
black
interposed
ricardo
yes
there
she
did
said
hanaud
drily
and
his
eyes
dropped
again
to
the
paper
i
knew
her
name
was
adele
for
often
i
have
heard
her
servant
calling
her
so
and
without
any
in
front
of
the
name
that
is
strange
is
it
not
to
hear
an
elderly
calling
after
her
mistress
just
simple
it
was
that
which
made
me
think
monsieur
and
madame
were
not
of
the
same
world
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
are
going
to
be
married
i
have
an
instinct
about
it
of
course
one
never
knows
with
what
extraordinary
women
the
nicest
men
will
fall
in
love
so
that
after
all
these
two
may
get
married
but
if
they
do
i
do
not
think
they
will
be
happy
besides
the
old
woman
there
was
another
servant
a
man
hippolyte
who
served
in
the
house
and
drove
the
carriage
when
it
was
wanted
a
respectable
man
he
always
touched
his
hat
when
mme
rossignol
came
out
of
the
house
he
slept
in
the
house
at
night
although
the
stable
was
at
the
end
of
the
street
i
thought
he
was
probably
the
son
of
jeanne
the
he
was
young
and
his
hair
was
plastered
down
upon
his
forehead
and
he
was
altogether
satisfied
with
himself
and
a
great
favorite
amongst
the
servants
in
the
street
the
carriage
and
the
horse
were
hired
from
geneva
that
is
the
household
of
mme
rossignol
so
far
ricardo
read
in
silence
then
he
broke
out
again
but
we
have
them
the
woman
called
adele
the
man
with
the
little
black
moustache
it
was
he
who
drove
the
hanaud
held
up
his
hand
to
check
the
flow
of
words
and
both
read
on
again
at
three
on
tuesday
afternoon
madame
was
driven
away
in
the
carriage
and
i
did
not
see
it
return
all
that
evening
of
course
it
may
have
returned
to
the
stables
by
another
road
but
it
was
not
unusual
for
the
carriage
to
take
her
into
geneva
and
wait
a
long
time
i
went
to
bed
at
eleven
but
in
the
night
gobin
was
restless
and
i
rose
to
get
him
some
medicine
we
slept
in
the
front
of
the
house
monsieur
and
while
i
was
searching
for
the
matches
upon
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
heard
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
in
the
silent
street
i
went
to
the
window
and
raising
a
corner
of
the
curtains
looked
out
gobin
called
to
me
fretfully
from
the
bed
to
know
why
i
did
not
light
the
candle
and
get
him
what
he
wanted
i
have
already
told
you
how
fretful
sick
men
can
be
always
complaining
if
just
for
a
minute
one
distracts
oneself
by
looking
out
of
the
window
but
there
one
can
do
nothing
to
please
them
yet
how
right
i
was
to
raise
the
blind
and
look
out
of
the
window
for
if
i
had
obeyed
my
husband
i
might
have
lost
four
thousand
francs
and
four
thousand
francs
are
not
to
be
sneezed
at
by
a
poor
woman
whose
husband
lies
in
bed
i
saw
the
carriage
stop
at
mme
rossignol
house
almost
at
once
the
house
door
was
opened
by
the
old
servant
although
the
hall
of
the
house
and
all
the
windows
in
the
front
were
dark
that
was
the
first
thing
that
surprised
me
for
when
madame
came
home
late
and
the
house
was
dark
she
used
to
let
herself
in
with
a
latchkey
now
in
the
dark
house
in
the
early
morning
a
servant
was
watching
for
them
it
was
strange
as
soon
as
the
door
of
the
house
was
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
opened
too
and
a
young
lady
stepped
quickly
out
on
to
the
pavement
the
train
of
her
dress
caught
in
the
door
and
she
turned
round
stooped
freed
it
with
her
hand
and
held
it
up
off
the
ground
the
night
was
clear
and
there
was
a
lamp
in
the
street
close
by
the
door
of
mme
rossignol
house
as
she
turned
i
saw
her
face
under
the
big
green
hat
it
was
very
pretty
and
young
and
the
hair
was
fair
she
wore
a
white
coat
but
it
was
open
in
front
and
showed
her
evening
frock
of
pale
green
when
she
lifted
her
skirt
i
saw
the
buckles
sparkling
on
her
satin
shoes
it
was
the
young
lady
for
whom
you
are
advertising
i
am
sure
she
remained
standing
just
for
a
moment
without
moving
while
mme
rossignol
got
out
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
young
lady
of
such
distinction
in
mme
rossignol
company
then
still
holding
her
skirt
up
she
ran
very
lightly
and
quickly
across
the
pavement
into
the
dark
house
i
thought
monsieur
that
she
was
very
anxious
not
to
be
seen
so
when
i
saw
your
advertisement
i
was
certain
that
this
was
the
young
lady
for
whom
you
are
searching
i
waited
for
a
few
moments
and
saw
the
carriage
drive
off
towards
the
stable
at
the
end
of
the
street
but
no
light
went
up
in
any
of
the
rooms
in
front
of
the
house
and
gobin
was
so
fretful
that
i
dropped
the
corner
of
the
blind
lit
the
candle
and
gave
him
his
cooling
drink
his
watch
was
on
the
table
at
the
bedside
and
i
saw
that
it
was
five
minutes
to
three
i
will
send
you
a
telegram
as
soon
as
i
am
sure
at
what
hour
i
can
leave
my
husband
accept
monsieur
i
beg
you
my
most
distinguished
salutations
marthe
gobin
hanaud
leant
back
with
an
extraordinary
look
of
perplexity
upon
his
face
but
to
ricardo
the
whole
story
was
now
clear
here
was
an
independent
witness
without
the
jealousy
or
rancours
of
helene
vauquier
nothing
could
be
more
damning
than
her
statement
it
corroborated
those
footmarks
upon
the
soil
in
front
of
the
glass
door
of
the
salon
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
set
about
arresting
mlle
celie
at
once
the
facts
work
with
your
theory
hanaud
the
young
man
with
the
black
moustache
did
not
return
to
the
house
at
geneva
for
somewhere
upon
the
road
close
to
geneva
he
met
the
carriage
he
was
driving
back
the
car
to
aix
and
then
another
thought
struck
him
but
no
he
cried
we
are
altogether
wrong
see
they
did
not
reach
home
until
five
minutes
to
three
five
minutes
to
three
but
this
demolished
the
whole
of
hanaud
theory
about
the
the
murderers
had
left
the
villa
between
eleven
and
twelve
probably
before
eleven
the
car
was
a
machine
of
sixty
and
the
roads
were
certain
to
be
clear
yet
the
travellers
only
reached
their
home
at
three
moreover
the
car
was
back
in
aix
at
four
it
was
evident
they
did
not
travel
by
the
car
geneva
time
is
an
hour
later
than
french
time
said
hanaud
shortly
it
seemed
as
if
the
corroboration
of
this
letter
disappointed
him
a
quarter
to
three
in
mme
gobin
house
would
be
a
quarter
to
two
by
our
watches
here
hanaud
folded
up
the
letter
and
rose
to
his
feet
we
will
go
now
and
we
will
take
this
letter
with
us
hanaud
looked
about
the
room
and
picked
up
a
glove
lying
upon
a
table
i
left
this
behind
me
he
said
putting
it
into
his
pocket
by
the
way
where
is
the
telegram
from
marthe
gobin
you
put
it
in
your
oh
did
i
hanaud
took
out
his
and
found
the
telegram
within
it
his
face
lightened
good
he
said
emphatically
for
since
we
have
this
telegram
there
must
have
been
another
message
sent
from
adele
rossignol
to
aix
saying
that
marthe
gobin
that
busybody
that
inquisitive
neighbour
who
had
no
doubt
seen
ricardo
advertisement
was
on
her
way
hither
oh
it
will
not
be
put
as
crudely
as
that
but
that
is
what
the
message
will
mean
we
shall
have
him
and
suddenly
his
face
grew
very
stern
i
must
catch
him
for
marthe
gobin
death
i
can
not
forgive
a
poor
woman
meaning
no
harm
and
murdered
like
a
sheep
under
our
noses
no
that
i
can
not
forgive
ricardo
wondered
whether
it
was
the
actual
murder
of
marthe
gobin
or
the
fact
that
he
had
been
beaten
and
outwitted
which
hanaud
could
not
forgive
but
discretion
kept
him
silent
let
us
go
said
hanaud
by
the
lift
if
you
please
it
will
save
time
they
descended
into
the
hall
close
by
the
main
door
the
body
of
marthe
gobin
had
been
removed
to
the
mortuary
of
the
town
the
life
of
the
hotel
had
resumed
its
course
besnard
has
gone
i
suppose
hanaud
asked
of
the
porter
and
receiving
an
assent
he
walked
quickly
out
of
the
front
door
but
there
is
a
shorter
way
said
ricardo
running
after
him
across
the
garden
at
the
back
and
down
the
steps
it
will
make
no
difference
now
said
hanaud
they
hurried
along
the
drive
and
down
the
road
which
circled
round
the
hotel
and
dipped
to
the
town
behind
hanaud
hotel
ricardo
car
was
waiting
we
must
go
first
to
besnard
office
the
poor
man
will
be
at
his
wits
end
to
know
who
was
mme
gobin
and
what
brought
her
to
aix
besides
i
wish
to
send
a
message
over
the
telephone
hanaud
descended
and
spent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
the
commissaire
as
he
came
out
he
looked
at
his
watch
we
shall
be
in
time
i
think
he
said
he
climbed
into
the
car
the
murder
of
marthe
gobin
on
her
way
from
the
station
will
put
our
friends
at
their
ease
it
will
be
published
no
doubt
in
the
evening
papers
and
those
good
people
over
there
in
geneva
will
read
it
with
amusement
they
do
not
know
that
marthe
gobin
wrote
a
letter
yesterday
night
come
let
us
go
where
to
asked
ricardo
where
to
exclaimed
hanaud
why
of
course
to
geneva
chapter
xii
the
aluminium
flask
i
have
telephoned
to
lemerre
the
chef
de
la
surete
at
geneva
said
hanaud
as
the
car
sped
out
of
aix
along
the
road
to
annecy
he
will
have
the
house
watched
we
shall
be
in
time
they
will
do
nothing
until
dark
but
though
he
spoke
confidently
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
and
he
sat
forward
in
the
car
as
though
he
were
already
straining
his
eyes
to
see
geneva
ricardo
was
a
trifle
disappointed
they
were
on
the
great
journey
to
geneva
they
were
going
to
arrest
mlle
celie
and
her
accomplices
and
hanaud
had
not
come
disguised
hanaud
in
ricardo
eyes
was
hardly
living
up
to
the
dramatic
expedition
on
which
they
had
set
out
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
incorrect
in
the
great
detective
coming
out
on
the
chase
without
a
false
beard
but
my
dear
friend
why
should
i
pleaded
hanaud
we
are
going
to
dine
together
at
the
restaurant
du
nord
over
the
lake
until
it
grows
dark
it
is
not
pleasant
to
eat
one
soup
in
a
false
beard
have
you
tried
it
besides
everybody
stares
so
seeing
perfectly
well
that
it
is
false
now
i
do
not
want
that
people
should
know
me
for
a
detective
so
i
do
not
go
disguised
humorist
said
ricardo
there
you
have
found
me
out
cried
hanaud
in
mock
alarm
besides
i
told
you
this
morning
that
that
is
precisely
what
i
am
beyond
annecy
they
came
to
the
bridge
over
the
ravine
at
the
far
end
of
it
the
car
stopped
a
question
a
hurried
glance
into
the
body
of
the
car
and
the
officers
of
the
customs
stood
aside
you
see
how
perfunctory
it
is
said
hanaud
and
with
a
jerk
the
car
moved
on
the
jerk
threw
hanaud
against
ricardo
something
hard
in
the
detective
pocket
knocked
against
his
companion
you
have
got
them
he
whispered
what
the
handcuffs
another
disappointment
awaited
ricardo
a
detective
without
a
false
beard
was
bad
enough
but
that
was
nothing
to
a
detective
without
handcuffs
the
paraphernalia
of
justice
were
sadly
lacking
however
hanaud
consoled
ricardo
by
showing
him
the
hard
thing
it
was
almost
as
thrilling
as
the
handcuffs
for
it
was
a
loaded
revolver
there
will
be
danger
then
said
ricardo
with
a
tremor
of
excitement
i
should
have
brought
mine
there
would
have
been
danger
my
friend
hanaud
objected
gravely
if
you
had
brought
yours
they
reached
geneva
as
the
dusk
was
falling
and
drove
straight
to
the
restaurant
by
the
side
of
the
lake
and
mounted
to
the
balcony
on
the
first
floor
a
small
stout
man
sat
at
a
table
alone
in
a
corner
of
the
balcony
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hands
my
friend
lemerre
the
chef
de
la
surete
of
geneva
said
hanaud
presenting
the
little
man
to
his
companion
there
were
as
yet
only
two
couples
dining
in
the
restaurant
and
hanaud
spoke
so
that
neither
could
overhear
him
he
sat
down
at
the
table
what
news
he
asked
none
said
lemerre
no
one
has
come
out
of
the
house
no
one
has
gone
in
and
if
anything
happens
while
we
dine
we
shall
know
said
lemerre
look
there
is
a
man
loitering
under
the
trees
there
he
will
strike
a
match
to
light
his
pipe
the
hurried
conversation
was
ended
good
said
hanaud
we
will
dine
then
and
be
gay
he
called
to
the
waiter
and
ordered
dinner
it
was
after
seven
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
and
they
dined
while
the
dusk
deepened
in
the
street
below
the
lights
flashed
out
throwing
a
sheen
on
the
foliage
of
the
trees
at
the
water
side
upon
the
dark
lake
the
reflections
of
lamps
rippled
and
shook
a
boat
in
which
musicians
sang
to
music
passed
by
with
a
cool
splash
of
oars
the
green
and
red
lights
of
the
launches
glided
backwards
and
forwards
hanaud
alone
of
the
party
on
the
balcony
tried
to
keep
the
conversation
upon
a
light
and
general
level
but
it
was
plain
that
even
he
was
overdoing
his
gaiety
there
were
moments
when
a
sudden
contraction
of
the
muscles
would
clench
his
hands
and
give
a
spasmodic
jerk
to
his
shoulders
he
was
waiting
uneasily
uncomfortably
until
darkness
should
come
eat
he
cried
eat
my
friends
playing
with
his
own
barely
tasted
food
and
then
at
a
sentence
from
lemerre
his
knife
and
fork
clattered
on
his
plate
and
he
sat
with
a
face
suddenly
grown
white
for
lemerre
said
as
though
it
was
no
more
than
a
matter
of
ordinary
comment
so
mme
dauvray
jewels
were
after
all
never
stolen
hanaud
started
you
know
that
how
did
you
know
it
it
was
in
this
evening
paper
i
bought
one
on
the
way
here
they
were
found
under
the
floor
of
the
bedroom
and
even
as
he
spoke
a
newsboy
voice
rang
out
in
the
street
below
them
lemerre
was
alarmed
by
the
look
upon
his
friend
face
does
it
matter
hanaud
he
asked
with
some
solicitude
it
matters
and
hanaud
rose
up
abruptly
the
boy
voice
sounded
louder
in
the
street
below
the
words
became
distinct
to
all
upon
that
balcony
the
aix
murder
discovery
of
the
jewels
we
must
go
hanaud
whispered
hoarsely
here
are
life
and
death
in
the
balance
as
i
believe
and
there
he
pointed
down
to
the
little
group
gathering
about
the
newsboy
under
the
trees
there
is
the
command
which
way
to
tip
the
scales
it
was
not
i
who
sent
it
said
ricardo
eagerly
he
had
no
precise
idea
what
hanaud
meant
by
his
words
but
he
realised
that
the
sooner
he
exculpated
himself
from
the
charge
the
better
of
course
it
was
not
you
i
know
that
very
well
said
hanaud
he
called
for
the
bill
when
is
that
paper
published
at
seven
said
lemerre
they
have
been
crying
it
in
the
streets
of
geneva
then
for
more
than
half
an
hour
he
sat
drumming
impatiently
upon
the
table
until
the
bill
should
be
brought
by
heaven
that
clever
he
muttered
savagely
there
a
man
who
gets
ahead
of
me
at
every
turn
see
lemerre
i
take
every
care
every
precaution
that
no
message
shall
be
sent
i
let
it
be
known
i
take
careful
pains
to
let
it
be
known
that
no
message
can
be
sent
without
detection
following
and
here
the
message
sent
by
the
one
channel
i
never
thought
to
guard
against
and
stop
look
the
murder
at
the
villa
rose
and
the
mystery
which
hid
its
perpetration
had
aroused
interest
this
new
development
had
quickened
it
from
the
balcony
hanaud
could
see
the
groups
thickening
about
the
boy
and
the
white
sheets
of
the
newspapers
in
the
hands
of
every
one
in
geneva
or
near
geneva
will
know
of
this
message
by
now
who
could
have
told
asked
ricardo
blankly
and
hanaud
laughed
in
his
face
but
laughed
without
any
merriment
at
last
he
cried
as
the
waiter
brought
the
bill
and
just
as
he
had
paid
it
the
light
of
a
match
flared
up
under
the
trees
the
signal
said
lemerre
not
too
quickly
whispered
hanaud
with
as
much
unconcern
as
each
could
counterfeit
the
three
men
descended
the
stairs
and
crossed
the
road
under
the
trees
a
fourth
man
joined
them
he
who
had
lighted
his
pipe
the
coachman
hippolyte
he
whispered
bought
an
evening
paper
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
from
a
boy
who
came
down
the
street
shouting
the
news
the
coachman
ran
back
into
the
house
when
was
this
asked
lemerre
the
man
pointed
to
a
lad
who
leaned
against
the
balustrade
above
the
lake
hot
and
panting
for
breath
he
came
on
his
bicycle
he
has
just
arrived
follow
me
said
lemerre
six
yards
from
where
they
stood
a
couple
of
steps
led
down
from
the
embankment
on
to
a
wooden
where
boats
were
moored
lemerre
followed
by
the
others
walked
briskly
down
on
to
the
an
electric
launch
was
waiting
it
had
an
awning
and
was
of
the
usual
type
which
one
hires
at
geneva
there
were
two
sergeants
in
plain
clothes
on
board
and
a
third
man
whom
ricardo
recognised
that
is
the
man
who
found
out
in
whose
shop
the
cord
was
bought
he
said
to
hanaud
yes
it
is
durette
he
has
been
here
since
yesterday
lemerre
and
the
three
who
followed
him
stepped
into
it
and
it
backed
away
from
the
stage
and
turning
sped
swiftly
outwards
from
geneva
the
gay
lights
of
the
shops
and
the
restaurants
were
left
behind
the
cool
darkness
enveloped
them
a
light
breeze
blew
over
the
lake
a
trail
of
white
and
tumbled
water
lengthened
out
behind
and
overhead
in
a
sky
of
deepest
blue
the
bright
stars
shone
like
gold
if
only
we
are
in
time
said
hanaud
catching
his
breath
yes
answered
lemerre
and
in
both
their
voices
there
was
a
strange
note
of
gravity
lemerre
gave
a
signal
after
a
while
and
the
boat
turned
to
the
shore
and
reduced
its
speed
they
had
passed
the
big
villas
on
the
bank
the
gardens
of
houses
narrow
long
gardens
of
a
street
of
small
houses
reached
down
to
the
lake
and
to
almost
each
garden
there
was
a
rickety
of
wood
projecting
into
the
lake
again
lemerre
gave
a
signal
and
the
boat
speed
was
so
much
reduced
that
not
a
sound
of
its
coming
could
be
heard
it
moved
over
the
water
like
a
shadow
with
not
so
much
as
a
curl
of
white
at
its
bows
lemerre
touched
hanaud
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
to
a
house
in
a
row
of
houses
all
the
windows
except
two
upon
the
second
floor
and
one
upon
the
ground
floor
were
in
absolute
darkness
and
over
those
upper
two
the
wooden
shutters
were
closed
but
in
the
shutters
there
were
holes
and
from
these
holes
two
yellow
beams
of
light
like
glowing
eyes
upon
the
watch
streamed
out
and
melted
in
the
air
you
are
sure
that
the
front
of
the
house
is
guarded
asked
hanaud
anxiously
yes
replied
lemerre
ricardo
shivered
with
excitement
the
launch
slid
noiselessly
into
the
bank
and
lay
hidden
under
its
shadow
hanaud
turned
to
his
associates
with
his
finger
to
his
lips
something
gleamed
darkly
in
his
hand
it
was
the
barrel
of
his
revolver
cautiously
the
men
disembarked
and
crept
up
the
bank
first
came
lemerre
then
hanaud
ricardo
followed
him
and
the
fourth
man
who
had
struck
the
match
under
the
trees
brought
up
the
rear
the
other
three
officers
remained
in
the
boat
stooping
under
the
shadow
of
the
side
wall
of
the
garden
the
invaders
stole
towards
the
house
when
a
bush
rustled
or
a
tree
whispered
in
the
light
wind
ricardo
heart
jumped
to
his
throat
once
lemerre
stopped
as
though
his
ears
heard
a
sound
which
warned
him
of
danger
then
cautiously
he
crept
on
again
the
garden
was
a
ragged
place
of
unmown
lawn
and
straggling
bushes
behind
each
one
ricardo
seemed
to
feel
an
enemy
never
had
he
been
in
so
strait
a
predicament
he
the
cultured
host
of
grosvenor
square
was
creeping
along
under
a
wall
with
continental
policemen
he
was
going
to
raid
a
sinister
house
by
the
lake
of
geneva
it
was
thrilling
fear
and
excitement
gripped
him
in
turn
and
let
him
go
but
always
he
was
sustained
by
the
pride
of
the
man
doing
an
thing
if
only
my
friends
could
see
me
now
the
ancient
vanity
was
loud
in
his
bosom
poor
fellows
they
were
upon
yachts
in
the
solent
or
on
in
scotland
or
on
at
north
berwick
he
alone
of
them
all
was
tracking
malefactors
to
their
doom
by
leman
lake
from
these
agreeable
reflections
ricardo
was
shaken
lemerre
stopped
the
raiders
had
reached
the
angle
made
by
the
side
wall
of
the
garden
and
the
house
a
whisper
was
exchanged
and
the
party
turned
and
moved
along
the
house
wall
towards
the
lighted
window
on
the
ground
floor
as
lemerre
reached
it
he
stooped
then
slowly
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
rose
above
the
sill
and
glanced
this
way
and
that
into
the
room
ricardo
could
see
his
eyes
gleaming
as
the
light
from
the
window
caught
them
his
face
rose
completely
over
the
sill
he
stared
into
the
room
without
care
or
apprehension
and
then
dropped
again
out
of
the
reach
of
the
light
he
turned
to
hanaud
the
room
is
empty
he
whispered
hanaud
turned
to
ricardo
pass
under
the
sill
or
the
light
from
the
window
will
throw
your
shadow
upon
the
lawn
the
party
came
to
the
back
door
of
the
house
lemerre
tried
the
handle
of
the
door
and
to
his
surprise
it
yielded
they
crept
into
the
passage
the
last
man
closed
the
door
noiselessly
locked
it
and
removed
the
key
a
panel
of
light
shone
upon
the
wall
a
few
paces
ahead
the
door
of
the
lighted
room
was
open
as
ricardo
stepped
silently
past
it
he
looked
in
it
was
a
parlour
meanly
furnished
hanaud
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
pointed
to
the
table
ricardo
had
seen
the
objects
at
which
hanaud
pointed
often
enough
without
uneasiness
but
now
in
this
silent
house
of
crime
they
had
the
most
sinister
and
appalling
aspect
there
was
a
tiny
phial
half
full
of
a
liquid
beside
it
a
little
leather
case
lay
open
and
across
the
case
ready
for
use
or
waiting
to
be
filled
was
a
bright
morphia
needle
ricardo
felt
the
cold
creep
along
his
spine
and
shivered
come
whispered
hanaud
they
reached
the
foot
of
a
flight
of
stairs
and
cautiously
mounted
it
they
came
out
in
a
passage
which
ran
along
the
side
of
the
house
from
the
back
to
the
front
it
was
unlighted
but
they
were
now
on
the
level
of
the
street
and
a
glass
window
over
the
front
door
admitted
a
pale
light
there
was
a
street
lamp
near
to
the
door
ricardo
remembered
for
by
the
light
of
it
marthe
gobin
had
seen
celia
harland
run
so
nimbly
into
this
house
for
a
moment
the
men
in
the
passage
held
their
breath
some
one
strode
heavily
by
on
the
pavement
outside
to
ricardo
ear
a
most
companionable
sound
then
a
clock
upon
a
church
struck
the
musically
distantly
it
was
eight
and
a
second
afterwards
a
tiny
bright
light
shone
hanaud
was
directing
the
light
of
a
pocket
electric
torch
to
the
next
flight
of
stairs
here
the
steps
were
carpeted
and
once
more
the
men
crept
up
one
after
another
they
came
out
upon
the
next
landing
it
ran
like
those
below
it
along
the
side
of
the
house
from
the
back
to
the
front
and
the
doors
were
all
upon
their
left
hand
from
beneath
the
door
nearest
to
them
a
yellow
line
of
light
streamed
out
they
stood
in
the
darkness
listening
but
not
a
sound
came
from
behind
the
door
was
this
room
empty
too
in
each
one
mind
was
the
fear
that
the
birds
had
flown
lemerre
carefully
took
the
handle
of
the
door
and
turned
it
very
slowly
and
cautiously
he
opened
the
door
a
strong
light
beat
out
through
the
widening
gap
upon
his
face
and
then
though
his
feet
did
not
move
his
shoulders
and
his
face
drew
back
the
action
was
significant
enough
this
room
at
all
events
was
not
empty
but
of
what
lemerre
saw
in
the
room
his
face
gave
no
hint
he
opened
the
door
wider
and
now
hanaud
saw
ricardo
trembling
with
excitement
watched
him
but
again
there
was
no
expression
of
surprise
consternation
or
delight
he
stood
stolidly
and
watched
then
he
turned
to
ricardo
placed
a
finger
on
his
lips
and
made
room
ricardo
crept
on
tiptoe
to
his
side
and
now
he
too
could
look
in
he
saw
a
brightly
lit
bedroom
with
a
made
bed
on
his
left
were
the
shuttered
windows
overlooking
the
lake
on
his
right
in
the
partition
wall
a
door
stood
open
through
the
door
he
could
see
a
dark
windowless
closet
with
a
small
bed
from
which
the
bedclothes
hung
and
trailed
upon
the
floor
as
though
some
one
had
been
but
now
roughly
dragged
from
it
on
a
table
close
by
the
door
lay
a
big
green
hat
with
a
brown
ostrich
feather
and
a
white
cloak
but
the
amazing
spectacle
which
kept
him
riveted
was
just
in
front
of
him
an
old
hag
of
a
woman
was
sitting
in
a
chair
with
her
back
towards
them
she
was
mending
with
a
big
needle
the
holes
in
an
old
sack
and
while
she
bent
over
her
work
she
crooned
to
herself
some
french
song
every
now
and
then
she
raised
her
eyes
for
in
front
of
her
under
her
charge
mlle
celie
the
girl
of
whom
hanaud
was
in
search
lay
helpless
upon
a
sofa
the
train
of
her
delicate
green
frock
swept
the
floor
she
was
dressed
as
helene
vauquier
had
described
her
gloved
hands
were
tightly
bound
behind
her
back
her
feet
were
crossed
so
that
she
could
not
have
stood
and
her
ankles
were
cruelly
strapped
together
over
her
face
and
eyes
a
piece
of
coarse
sacking
was
stretched
like
a
mask
and
the
ends
were
roughly
sewn
together
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
lay
so
still
that
but
for
the
labouring
of
her
bosom
and
a
tremor
which
now
and
again
shook
her
limbs
the
watchers
would
have
thought
her
dead
she
made
no
struggle
of
resistance
she
lay
quiet
and
still
once
she
writhed
but
it
was
with
the
uneasiness
of
one
in
pain
and
the
moment
she
stirred
the
old
woman
hand
went
out
to
a
bright
aluminium
flask
which
stood
on
a
little
table
at
her
side
keep
quiet
little
one
she
ordered
in
a
careless
chiding
voice
and
she
rapped
with
the
flask
peremptorily
upon
the
table
immediately
as
though
the
tapping
had
some
strange
message
of
terror
for
the
ear
she
stiffened
her
whole
body
and
lay
rigid
i
am
not
ready
for
you
yet
little
fool
said
the
old
woman
and
she
bent
again
to
her
work
ricardo
brain
whirled
here
was
the
girl
whom
they
had
come
to
arrest
who
had
sprung
from
the
salon
with
so
much
activity
of
youth
across
the
stretch
of
grass
who
had
run
so
quickly
and
lightly
across
the
pavement
into
this
very
house
so
that
she
should
not
be
seen
and
now
she
was
lying
in
her
fine
and
delicate
attire
a
captive
at
the
mercy
of
the
very
people
who
were
her
accomplices
suddenly
a
scream
rang
out
in
the
garden
a
shrill
loud
scream
close
beneath
the
windows
the
old
woman
sprang
to
her
feet
the
girl
on
the
sofa
raised
her
head
the
old
woman
took
a
step
towards
the
window
and
then
she
swiftly
turned
towards
the
door
she
saw
the
men
upon
the
threshold
she
uttered
a
bellow
of
rage
there
is
no
other
word
to
describe
the
sound
it
was
not
a
human
cry
it
was
the
bellow
of
an
angry
animal
she
reached
out
her
hand
towards
the
flask
but
before
she
could
grasp
it
hanaud
seized
her
she
burst
into
a
torrent
of
foul
oaths
hanaud
flung
her
across
to
lemerre
officer
who
dragged
her
from
the
room
quick
said
hanaud
pointing
to
the
girl
who
was
now
struggling
helplessly
upon
the
sofa
mlle
celie
ricardo
cut
the
stitches
of
the
sacking
hanaud
unstrapped
her
hands
and
feet
they
helped
her
to
sit
up
she
shook
her
hands
in
the
air
as
though
they
tortured
her
and
then
in
a
piteous
whimpering
voice
like
a
child
she
babbled
incoherently
and
whispered
prayers
suddenly
the
prayers
ceased
she
sat
stiff
with
eyes
fixed
and
staring
she
was
watching
lemerre
and
she
was
watching
him
fascinated
with
terror
he
was
holding
in
his
hand
the
large
bright
aluminium
flask
he
poured
a
little
of
the
contents
very
carefully
on
to
a
piece
of
the
sack
and
then
with
an
exclamation
of
anger
he
turned
towards
hanaud
but
hanaud
was
supporting
celia
and
so
as
lemerre
turned
abruptly
towards
him
with
the
flask
in
his
hand
he
turned
abruptly
towards
celia
too
she
wrenched
herself
from
hanaud
arms
she
shrank
violently
away
her
white
face
flushed
scarlet
and
grew
white
again
she
screamed
loudly
terribly
and
after
the
scream
she
uttered
a
strange
weak
sigh
and
so
fell
sideways
in
a
swoon
hanaud
caught
her
as
she
fell
a
light
broke
over
his
face
now
i
understand
he
cried
good
god
that
horrible
chapter
xiii
in
the
house
at
geneva
it
was
well
ricardo
thought
that
some
one
understood
for
himself
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
did
not
indeed
in
his
view
the
first
principles
of
reasoning
seemed
to
be
set
at
naught
it
was
obvious
from
the
solicitude
with
which
celia
harland
was
surrounded
that
every
one
except
himself
was
convinced
of
her
innocence
yet
it
was
equally
obvious
that
any
one
who
bore
in
mind
the
eight
points
he
had
tabulated
against
her
must
be
convinced
of
her
guilt
yet
again
if
she
were
guilty
how
did
it
happen
that
she
had
been
so
mishandled
by
her
accomplices
he
was
not
allowed
however
to
reflect
upon
these
remarkable
problems
he
had
too
busy
a
time
of
it
at
one
moment
he
was
running
to
fetch
water
wherewith
to
bathe
celia
forehead
at
another
when
he
had
returned
with
the
water
he
was
distracted
by
the
appearance
of
durette
the
inspector
from
aix
in
the
doorway
we
have
them
both
he
said
hippolyte
and
the
woman
they
were
hiding
in
the
garden
so
i
thought
said
hanaud
when
i
saw
the
door
open
downstairs
and
the
on
the
table
lemerre
turned
to
one
of
the
officers
let
them
be
taken
with
old
jeanne
in
cabs
to
the
depot
and
when
the
man
had
gone
upon
his
errand
lemerre
spoke
to
hanaud
you
will
stay
here
to
arrange
for
their
transfer
to
aix
i
will
leave
durette
behind
said
hanaud
i
am
needed
at
aix
we
will
make
a
formal
application
for
the
prisoners
he
was
kneeling
by
celia
side
and
awkwardly
dabbing
her
forehead
with
a
wet
handkerchief
he
raised
a
warning
hand
celia
harland
moved
and
opened
her
eyes
she
sat
up
on
the
sofa
shivering
and
looked
with
dazed
and
wondering
eyes
from
one
to
another
of
the
strangers
who
surrounded
her
she
searched
in
vain
for
a
familiar
face
you
are
amongst
good
friends
mlle
celie
said
hanaud
with
great
gentleness
oh
i
wonder
i
wonder
she
cried
piteously
be
very
sure
of
it
he
said
heartily
and
she
clung
to
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
with
desperate
hands
i
suppose
you
are
friends
she
said
else
why
and
she
moved
her
numbed
limbs
to
make
certain
that
she
was
free
she
looked
about
the
room
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
sack
and
widened
with
terror
they
came
to
me
a
little
while
ago
in
that
cupboard
there
adele
and
the
old
woman
jeanne
they
made
me
get
up
they
told
me
they
were
going
to
take
me
away
they
brought
my
clothes
and
dressed
me
in
everything
i
wore
when
i
came
so
that
no
single
trace
of
me
might
be
left
behind
then
they
tied
me
she
tore
off
her
gloves
and
showed
them
her
lacerated
wrists
i
think
they
meant
to
kill
me
horribly
and
she
caught
her
breath
and
whimpered
like
a
child
her
spirit
was
broken
my
poor
girl
all
that
is
over
said
hanaud
and
he
stood
up
but
at
the
first
movement
he
made
she
cried
incisively
no
and
tightened
the
clutch
of
her
fingers
upon
his
sleeve
but
mademoiselle
you
are
safe
he
said
with
a
smile
she
stared
at
him
stupidly
it
seemed
the
words
had
no
meaning
for
her
she
would
not
let
him
go
it
was
only
the
feel
of
his
coat
within
the
clutch
of
her
fingers
which
gave
her
any
comfort
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
am
safe
she
said
with
a
wan
little
smile
tell
me
mademoiselle
what
have
you
had
to
eat
and
drink
during
the
last
two
days
is
it
two
days
she
asked
i
was
in
the
dark
there
i
did
not
know
a
little
bread
a
little
water
that
what
is
wrong
said
hanaud
come
let
us
go
from
here
yes
yes
celia
cried
eagerly
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
tottered
hanaud
put
his
arm
about
her
you
are
very
kind
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
again
doubt
looked
out
from
her
face
and
disappeared
i
am
sure
that
i
can
trust
you
ricardo
fetched
her
cloak
and
slipped
it
on
her
shoulders
then
he
brought
her
hat
and
she
pinned
it
on
she
turned
to
hanaud
unconsciously
familiar
words
rose
to
her
lips
is
it
straight
she
asked
and
hanaud
laughed
outright
and
in
a
moment
celia
smiled
herself
supported
by
hanaud
she
stumbled
down
the
stairs
to
the
garden
as
they
passed
the
open
door
of
the
lighted
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
house
hanaud
turned
back
to
lemerre
and
pointed
silently
to
the
and
the
phial
lemerre
nodded
his
head
and
going
into
the
room
took
them
away
they
went
out
again
into
the
garden
celia
harland
threw
back
her
head
to
the
stars
and
drew
in
a
deep
breath
of
the
cool
night
air
i
did
not
think
she
said
in
a
low
voice
to
see
the
stars
again
they
walked
slowly
down
the
length
of
the
garden
and
hanaud
lifted
her
into
the
launch
she
turned
and
caught
his
coat
you
must
come
too
she
said
stubbornly
hanaud
sprang
in
beside
her
for
he
said
gaily
i
am
your
papa
ricardo
and
the
others
followed
and
the
launch
moved
out
over
the
lake
under
the
stars
the
bow
was
turned
towards
geneva
the
water
tumbled
behind
them
like
white
fire
the
night
breeze
blew
fresh
upon
their
faces
they
disembarked
at
the
and
then
lemerre
bowed
to
celia
and
took
his
leave
hanaud
led
celia
up
on
to
the
balcony
of
the
restaurant
and
ordered
supper
there
were
people
still
dining
at
the
tables
one
party
indeed
sitting
late
over
their
coffee
ricardo
recognised
with
a
kind
of
shock
they
had
taken
their
places
the
very
places
in
which
they
now
sat
before
he
and
hanaud
and
lemerre
had
left
the
restaurant
upon
their
expedition
of
rescue
into
that
short
interval
of
time
so
much
that
was
eventful
had
been
crowded
hanaud
leaned
across
the
table
to
celia
and
said
in
a
low
voice
mademoiselle
if
i
may
suggest
it
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
put
on
your
gloves
otherwise
they
may
notice
your
wrists
celia
followed
his
advice
she
ate
some
food
and
drank
a
glass
of
champagne
a
little
colour
returned
to
her
cheeks
you
are
very
kind
to
me
you
and
monsieur
your
friend
she
said
with
a
smile
towards
ricardo
but
for
you
and
her
voice
shook
hush
said
hanaud
all
that
is
over
we
will
not
speak
of
it
celia
looked
out
across
the
road
on
to
the
trees
of
which
the
dark
foliage
was
brightened
and
made
pale
by
the
lights
of
the
restaurant
out
on
the
water
some
one
was
singing
it
seems
impossible
to
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
that
i
am
here
in
the
open
air
and
free
hanaud
looked
at
his
watch
mlle
celie
it
is
past
ten
ricardo
car
is
waiting
there
under
the
trees
i
want
you
to
drive
back
to
aix
i
have
taken
rooms
for
you
at
an
hotel
and
there
will
be
a
nurse
from
the
hospital
to
look
after
you
thank
you
monsieur
she
said
you
have
thought
of
everything
but
i
shall
not
need
a
nurse
but
you
will
have
a
nurse
said
hanaud
firmly
you
feel
stronger
now
yes
but
when
you
lay
your
head
upon
your
pillow
mademoiselle
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
know
that
you
have
her
within
call
and
in
a
day
or
two
he
added
gently
you
will
perhaps
be
able
to
tell
us
what
happened
on
tuesday
night
at
the
villa
rose
celia
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
a
few
moments
then
she
drew
them
away
and
said
simply
yes
monsieur
i
will
tell
you
hanaud
bowed
to
her
with
a
genuine
deference
thank
you
mademoiselle
he
said
and
in
his
voice
there
was
a
strong
ring
of
sympathy
they
went
downstairs
and
entered
ricardo
motor
car
i
want
to
send
a
telephone
message
said
hanaud
if
you
will
wait
here
no
cried
celia
decisively
and
she
again
laid
hold
of
his
coat
with
a
pretty
imperiousness
as
though
he
belonged
to
her
but
i
must
said
hanaud
with
a
laugh
then
i
will
come
too
said
celia
and
she
opened
the
door
and
set
a
foot
upon
the
step
you
will
not
mademoiselle
said
hanaud
with
a
laugh
will
you
take
your
foot
back
into
that
car
that
is
better
now
you
will
sit
with
your
friend
ricardo
whom
by
the
way
i
have
not
yet
introduced
to
you
he
is
a
very
good
friend
of
yours
mademoiselle
and
will
in
the
future
be
a
still
better
one
ricardo
felt
his
conscience
rather
heavy
within
him
for
he
had
come
out
to
geneva
with
the
fixed
intention
of
arresting
her
as
a
most
dangerous
criminal
even
now
he
could
not
understand
how
she
could
be
innocent
of
a
share
in
mme
dauvray
murder
but
hanaud
evidently
thought
she
was
and
since
hanaud
thought
so
why
it
was
better
to
say
nothing
if
one
was
sensitive
to
gibes
so
ricardo
sat
and
talked
with
her
while
hanaud
ran
back
into
the
restaurant
it
mattered
very
little
however
what
he
said
for
celia
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
doorway
through
which
hanaud
had
disappeared
and
when
he
came
back
she
was
quick
to
turn
the
handle
of
the
door
now
mademoiselle
we
will
wrap
you
up
in
ricardo
spare
and
cover
your
knees
with
a
rug
and
put
you
between
us
and
then
you
can
go
to
sleep
the
car
sped
through
the
streets
of
geneva
celia
harland
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
nestled
down
between
the
two
men
if
i
knew
you
better
she
said
to
hanaud
i
should
tell
you
what
of
course
i
do
not
tell
you
now
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
a
big
newfoundland
dog
with
me
mlle
celie
said
hanaud
and
his
voice
told
her
that
he
was
moved
that
is
a
very
pretty
thing
which
you
have
said
to
me
the
lights
of
the
city
fell
away
behind
them
now
only
a
glow
in
the
sky
spoke
of
geneva
now
even
that
was
gone
and
with
a
smooth
continuous
purr
the
car
raced
through
the
cool
darkness
the
great
head
lamps
threw
a
bright
circle
of
light
before
them
and
the
road
slipped
away
beneath
the
wheels
like
a
running
tide
celia
fell
asleep
even
when
the
car
stopped
at
the
pont
de
la
caille
she
did
not
waken
the
door
was
opened
a
search
for
contraband
was
made
the
book
was
signed
still
she
did
not
wake
the
car
sped
on
you
see
coming
into
france
is
a
different
affair
said
hanaud
yes
replied
ricardo
still
i
will
own
it
you
caught
me
napping
yesterday
i
did
exclaimed
ricardo
joyfully
you
did
returned
hanaud
i
had
never
heard
of
the
pont
de
la
caille
but
you
will
not
mention
it
you
will
not
ruin
me
i
will
not
answered
ricardo
superb
in
his
magnanimity
you
are
a
good
detective
oh
thank
you
thank
you
cried
hanaud
in
a
voice
which
shook
surely
with
emotion
he
wrung
ricardo
hand
he
wiped
an
imaginary
tear
from
his
eye
and
still
celia
slept
ricardo
looked
at
her
he
said
to
hanaud
in
a
whisper
yet
i
do
not
understand
the
car
though
no
serious
search
was
made
must
still
have
stopped
at
the
pont
de
la
caille
on
the
swiss
side
why
did
she
not
cry
for
help
then
one
cry
and
she
was
safe
a
movement
even
was
enough
do
you
understand
hanaud
nodded
his
head
i
think
so
he
answered
with
a
very
gentle
look
at
celia
yes
i
think
so
when
celia
was
aroused
she
found
that
the
car
had
stopped
before
the
door
of
an
hotel
and
that
a
woman
in
the
dress
of
a
nurse
was
standing
in
the
doorway
you
can
trust
marie
said
hanaud
and
celia
turned
as
she
stood
upon
the
ground
and
gave
her
hands
to
the
two
men
thank
you
thank
you
both
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
she
looked
at
hanaud
and
nodded
her
head
you
understand
why
i
thank
you
so
very
much
yes
said
hanaud
but
mademoiselle
and
he
bent
over
the
car
and
spoke
to
her
quietly
holding
her
hand
there
is
always
a
big
newfoundland
dog
in
the
worst
of
troubles
if
only
you
will
look
for
him
i
tell
you
so
i
who
belong
to
the
surete
in
paris
do
not
lose
heart
and
in
his
mind
he
added
god
forgive
me
for
the
lie
he
shook
her
hand
and
let
it
go
and
gathering
up
her
skirt
she
went
into
the
hall
of
the
hotel
hanaud
watched
her
as
she
went
she
was
to
him
a
lonely
and
pathetic
creature
in
spite
of
the
nurse
who
bore
her
company
you
must
be
a
good
friend
to
that
young
girl
ricardo
he
said
let
us
drive
to
your
hotel
yes
said
ricardo
and
as
they
went
the
curiosity
which
all
the
way
from
geneva
had
been
smouldering
within
him
burst
into
flame
will
you
explain
to
me
one
thing
he
asked
when
the
scream
came
from
the
garden
you
were
not
surprised
indeed
you
said
that
when
you
saw
the
open
door
and
the
on
the
table
of
the
little
room
downstairs
you
thought
adele
and
the
man
hippolyte
were
hiding
in
the
garden
yes
i
did
think
so
why
and
why
did
the
publication
that
the
jewels
had
been
discovered
so
alarm
you
ah
said
hanaud
did
not
you
understand
that
yet
it
is
surely
clear
and
obvious
if
you
once
grant
that
the
girl
was
innocent
was
a
witness
of
the
crime
and
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
criminals
grant
me
those
premisses
ricardo
for
a
moment
and
you
will
see
that
we
had
just
one
chance
of
finding
the
girl
alive
in
geneva
from
the
first
i
was
sure
of
that
what
was
the
one
chance
why
this
she
might
be
kept
alive
on
the
chance
that
she
could
be
forced
to
tell
what
by
the
way
she
did
not
know
namely
the
place
where
mme
dauvray
valuable
jewels
were
secreted
now
follow
this
we
the
police
find
the
jewels
and
take
charge
of
them
let
that
news
reach
the
house
in
geneva
and
on
the
same
night
mlle
celie
loses
her
life
and
not
very
pleasantly
they
have
no
further
use
for
her
she
is
merely
a
danger
to
them
so
i
take
my
precautions
never
mind
for
the
moment
what
they
were
i
take
care
that
if
the
murderer
is
in
aix
and
gets
wind
of
our
discovery
he
shall
not
be
able
to
communicate
his
news
the
post
office
would
have
stopped
letters
or
telegrams
said
ricardo
i
understand
on
the
contrary
replied
hanaud
no
i
took
my
precautions
which
were
of
quite
a
different
kind
before
i
knew
the
house
in
geneva
or
the
name
of
rossignol
but
one
way
of
communication
i
did
not
think
of
i
did
not
think
of
the
possibility
that
the
news
might
be
sent
to
a
newspaper
which
of
course
would
publish
it
and
cry
it
through
the
streets
of
geneva
the
moment
i
heard
the
news
i
knew
we
must
hurry
the
garden
of
the
house
ran
down
to
the
lake
a
means
of
disposing
of
mlle
celie
was
close
at
hand
and
the
night
had
fallen
as
it
was
we
arrived
just
in
time
and
no
earlier
than
just
in
time
the
paper
had
been
bought
the
message
had
reached
the
house
mlle
celie
was
no
longer
of
any
use
and
every
hour
she
stayed
in
that
house
was
of
course
an
hour
of
danger
to
her
captors
what
were
they
going
to
do
asked
ricardo
hanaud
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
not
pretty
what
they
were
going
to
do
we
reach
the
garden
in
our
launch
at
that
moment
hippolyte
and
adele
who
is
most
likely
hippolyte
wife
are
in
the
lighted
parlour
on
the
basement
floor
adele
is
preparing
her
hippolyte
is
going
to
get
ready
the
which
was
tied
at
the
end
of
the
quietly
as
we
came
into
the
bank
they
heard
or
saw
us
they
ran
out
and
hid
in
the
garden
having
no
time
to
lock
the
garden
door
or
perhaps
not
daring
to
lock
it
lest
the
sound
of
the
key
should
reach
our
ears
we
find
that
door
upon
the
latch
the
door
of
the
room
open
on
the
table
lies
the
upstairs
lies
mlle
celie
she
is
helpless
she
can
not
see
what
they
are
meaning
to
do
but
she
could
cry
out
exclaimed
ricardo
she
did
not
even
do
that
no
my
friend
she
could
not
cry
out
replied
hanaud
very
seriously
i
know
why
she
could
not
no
living
man
or
woman
could
rest
assured
of
that
ricardo
was
mystified
but
since
the
captain
of
the
ship
would
not
show
his
observation
he
knew
it
would
be
in
vain
to
press
him
well
while
adele
was
preparing
her
and
hippolyte
was
about
to
prepare
the
boat
jeanne
upstairs
was
making
her
preparation
too
she
was
mending
a
sack
did
you
see
mlle
celie
eyes
and
face
when
first
she
saw
that
sack
ah
she
understood
they
meant
to
give
her
a
dose
of
morphia
and
as
soon
as
she
became
unconscious
they
were
going
perhaps
to
take
some
terrible
precaution
hanaud
paused
for
a
second
i
only
say
perhaps
as
to
that
but
certainly
they
were
going
to
sew
her
up
in
that
sack
row
her
well
out
across
the
lake
fix
a
weight
to
her
feet
and
drop
her
quietly
overboard
she
was
to
wear
everything
which
she
had
brought
with
her
to
the
house
mlle
celie
would
have
disappeared
for
ever
and
left
not
even
a
ripple
upon
the
water
to
trace
her
by
ricardo
clenched
his
hands
but
that
horrible
he
cried
and
as
he
uttered
the
words
the
car
swerved
into
the
drive
and
stopped
before
the
door
of
the
hotel
majestic
ricardo
sprang
out
a
feeling
of
remorse
seized
hold
of
him
all
through
that
evening
he
had
not
given
one
thought
to
harry
wethermill
so
utterly
had
the
excitement
of
each
moment
engrossed
his
mind
he
will
be
glad
to
know
cried
ricardo
at
all
events
he
shall
sleep
i
ought
to
have
telegraphed
to
him
from
geneva
that
we
and
miss
celia
were
coming
back
he
ran
up
the
steps
into
the
hotel
i
took
care
that
he
should
know
said
hanaud
as
he
followed
in
ricardo
steps
then
the
message
could
not
have
reached
him
else
he
would
have
been
expecting
us
replied
ricardo
as
he
hurried
into
the
office
where
a
clerk
sat
at
his
books
is
wethermill
in
he
asked
the
clerk
eyed
him
strangely
wethermill
was
arrested
this
evening
he
said
ricardo
stepped
back
arrested
when
at
minutes
past
ten
replied
the
clerk
shortly
ah
said
hanaud
quietly
that
was
my
telephone
message
ricardo
stared
in
stupefaction
at
his
companion
arrested
he
cried
arrested
but
what
for
for
the
murders
of
marthe
gobin
and
mme
dauvray
said
hanaud
chapter
xiv
ricardo
is
bewildered
ricardo
passed
a
most
tempestuous
night
he
was
tossed
amongst
dark
problems
now
it
was
harry
wethermill
who
beset
him
he
repeated
and
repeated
the
name
trying
to
grasp
the
new
and
sinister
suggestion
which
if
hanaud
were
right
its
sound
must
henceforth
bear
of
course
hanaud
might
be
wrong
only
if
he
were
wrong
how
had
he
come
to
suspect
harry
wethermill
what
had
first
directed
his
thoughts
to
that
seemingly
man
and
when
certain
recollections
became
vivid
in
ricardo
mind
the
luncheon
at
the
villa
rose
for
instance
hanaud
had
been
so
insistent
that
the
woman
with
the
red
hair
was
to
be
found
in
geneva
had
so
clearly
laid
it
down
that
a
message
a
telegram
a
letter
from
aix
to
geneva
would
enable
him
to
lay
his
hands
upon
the
murderer
in
aix
he
was
isolating
the
house
in
geneva
even
so
early
in
the
history
of
his
investigations
even
so
soon
he
suspected
harry
wethermill
brains
and
audacity
yes
these
two
qualities
he
had
stipulated
in
the
criminal
ricardo
now
for
the
first
time
understood
the
trend
of
all
hanaud
talk
at
that
luncheon
he
was
putting
harry
wethermill
upon
his
guard
he
was
immobilising
him
he
was
fettering
him
in
precautions
with
a
subtle
skill
he
was
forcing
him
to
isolate
himself
and
he
was
doing
it
deliberately
to
save
the
life
of
celia
harland
in
geneva
once
ricardo
lifted
himself
up
with
the
hair
stirring
on
his
scalp
he
himself
had
been
with
wethermill
in
the
on
the
very
night
of
the
murder
they
had
walked
together
up
the
hill
to
the
hotel
it
could
not
be
that
harry
wethermill
was
guilty
and
yet
he
suddenly
remembered
they
had
together
left
the
rooms
at
an
early
hour
it
was
only
ten
when
they
had
separated
in
the
hall
when
they
had
gone
each
to
his
own
room
there
would
have
been
time
for
wethermill
to
reach
the
villa
rose
and
do
his
dreadful
work
upon
that
night
before
twelve
if
all
had
been
arranged
beforehand
if
all
went
as
it
had
been
arranged
and
as
he
thought
upon
the
careful
planning
of
that
crime
and
remembered
wethermill
easy
chatter
as
they
had
strolled
from
table
to
table
in
the
villa
des
fleurs
ricardo
shuddered
though
he
encouraged
a
taste
for
the
bizarre
it
was
with
an
effort
he
was
naturally
of
an
orderly
mind
and
to
touch
the
eerie
or
inhuman
caused
him
a
physical
discomfort
so
now
he
marvelled
in
a
great
uneasiness
at
the
calm
placidity
with
which
wethermill
had
talked
his
arm
in
his
while
the
load
of
so
dark
a
crime
to
be
committed
within
the
hour
lay
upon
his
mind
each
minute
he
must
have
been
thinking
with
a
swift
spasm
of
the
heart
should
such
a
precaution
fail
should
such
or
such
an
unforeseen
thing
intervene
yet
there
had
been
never
a
sign
of
disturbance
never
a
hint
of
any
disquietude
then
ricardo
thoughts
turned
as
he
tossed
upon
his
bed
to
celia
harland
a
tragic
and
a
lonely
figure
he
recalled
the
look
of
tenderness
upon
her
face
when
her
eyes
had
met
harry
across
the
in
the
villa
des
fleurs
he
gained
some
insight
into
the
reason
why
she
had
clung
so
desperately
to
yesterday
not
merely
had
he
saved
her
life
she
was
lying
with
all
her
world
of
trust
and
illusion
broken
about
her
and
hanaud
had
raised
her
up
she
had
found
some
one
whom
she
trusted
the
big
newfoundland
dog
as
she
expressed
it
ricardo
was
still
thinking
of
celia
harland
when
the
morning
came
he
fell
asleep
and
awoke
to
find
hanaud
by
his
bed
you
will
be
wanted
said
hanaud
ricardo
got
up
and
walked
down
from
the
hotel
with
the
detective
the
front
door
faces
the
hillside
of
mont
revard
and
on
this
side
ricardo
rooms
looked
out
the
drive
from
the
front
door
curves
round
the
end
of
the
long
building
and
joins
the
road
which
then
winds
down
towards
the
town
past
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
down
this
road
the
two
men
walked
while
the
supporting
wall
of
the
garden
upon
their
right
hand
grew
higher
and
higher
above
their
heads
they
came
to
a
steep
flight
of
steps
which
makes
a
short
cut
from
the
hotel
to
the
road
and
at
the
steps
hanaud
stopped
do
you
see
he
said
on
the
opposite
side
there
are
no
houses
there
is
only
a
wall
behind
the
wall
there
are
climbing
gardens
and
the
ground
falls
steeply
to
the
turn
of
the
road
below
there
a
flight
of
steps
leading
down
which
corresponds
with
the
flight
of
steps
from
the
garden
very
often
there
a
stationed
on
the
top
of
the
steps
but
there
was
not
one
there
yesterday
afternoon
at
three
behind
us
is
the
supporting
wall
of
the
hotel
garden
well
look
about
you
we
can
not
be
seen
from
the
hotel
there
not
a
soul
in
sight
yes
there
some
one
coming
up
the
hill
but
we
have
been
standing
here
quite
long
enough
for
you
to
stab
me
and
get
back
to
your
coffee
on
the
verandah
of
the
hotel
ricardo
started
back
marthe
gobin
he
cried
it
was
here
then
hanaud
nodded
when
we
returned
from
the
station
in
your
and
went
up
to
your
rooms
we
passed
harry
wethermill
sitting
upon
the
verandah
over
the
garden
drinking
his
coffee
he
had
the
news
then
that
marthe
gobin
was
on
her
way
but
you
had
isolated
the
house
in
geneva
how
could
he
have
the
news
exclaimed
ricardo
whose
brain
was
whirling
i
had
isolated
the
house
from
him
in
the
sense
that
he
dared
not
communicate
with
his
accomplices
that
is
what
you
have
to
remember
he
could
not
even
let
them
know
that
they
must
not
communicate
with
him
so
he
received
a
telegram
it
was
carefully
worded
no
doubt
he
had
arranged
the
wording
of
any
message
with
the
care
which
was
used
in
all
the
preparations
it
ran
like
this
and
hanaud
took
a
scrap
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
read
out
from
it
a
copy
of
the
telegram
arrives
aix
to
negotiate
purchase
of
your
patent
the
telegram
was
handed
in
at
geneva
station
at
five
minutes
after
the
train
had
left
which
carried
marthe
gobin
to
aix
and
more
it
was
handed
in
by
a
man
strongly
resembling
hippolyte
tace
that
we
know
that
was
madness
said
ricardo
but
what
else
could
they
do
over
there
in
geneva
they
did
not
know
that
harry
wethermill
was
suspected
harry
wethermill
had
no
idea
of
it
himself
but
even
if
they
had
known
they
must
take
the
risk
put
yourself
into
their
place
for
a
moment
they
had
seen
my
advertisement
about
celie
harland
in
the
geneva
paper
marthe
gobin
that
busybody
who
was
always
watching
her
neighbours
was
no
doubt
watched
herself
they
see
her
leave
the
house
an
unusual
proceeding
for
her
with
her
husband
ill
as
her
own
letter
tells
us
hippolyte
follows
her
to
the
station
sees
her
take
her
ticket
to
aix
and
mount
into
the
train
he
must
guess
at
once
that
she
saw
celie
harland
enter
their
house
that
she
is
travelling
to
aix
with
the
information
of
her
whereabouts
at
all
costs
she
must
be
prevented
from
giving
that
information
at
all
risks
therefore
the
warning
telegram
must
be
sent
to
harry
wethermill
ricardo
recognised
the
force
of
the
argument
if
only
you
had
heard
of
the
telegram
yesterday
in
time
he
cried
ah
yes
hanaud
agreed
but
it
was
only
sent
off
at
a
quarter
to
one
it
was
delivered
to
wethermill
and
a
copy
was
sent
to
the
prefecture
but
the
telegram
was
delivered
first
when
was
it
delivered
to
wethermill
asked
ricardo
at
three
we
had
already
left
for
the
station
wethermill
was
sitting
on
the
verandah
the
telegram
was
brought
to
him
there
it
was
brought
by
a
waiter
in
the
hotel
who
remembers
the
incident
very
well
wethermill
has
seven
minutes
and
the
time
it
will
take
for
marthe
gobin
to
drive
from
the
station
to
the
majestic
what
does
he
do
he
runs
up
first
to
your
rooms
very
likely
not
yet
knowing
what
he
must
do
he
runs
up
to
verify
his
telegram
are
you
sure
of
that
cried
ricardo
how
can
you
be
you
were
at
the
station
with
me
what
makes
you
sure
hanaud
produced
a
brown
kid
glove
from
his
pocket
this
that
is
your
glove
you
told
me
so
yesterday
i
told
you
so
replied
hanaud
calmly
but
it
is
not
my
glove
it
is
wethermill
there
are
his
initials
stamped
upon
the
lining
see
i
picked
up
that
glove
in
your
room
after
we
had
returned
from
the
station
it
was
not
there
before
he
went
to
your
rooms
no
doubt
he
searched
for
a
telegram
fortunately
he
did
not
examine
your
letters
or
marthe
gobin
would
never
have
spoken
to
us
as
she
did
after
she
was
dead
then
what
did
he
do
asked
ricardo
eagerly
and
though
hanaud
had
been
with
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
station
all
this
while
he
asked
the
question
in
absolute
confidence
that
the
true
answer
would
be
given
to
him
he
returned
to
the
verandah
wondering
what
he
should
do
he
saw
us
come
back
from
the
station
in
the
and
go
up
to
your
room
we
were
alone
marthe
gobin
then
was
following
there
was
his
chance
marthe
gobin
must
not
reach
us
must
not
tell
her
news
to
us
he
ran
down
the
garden
steps
to
the
gate
no
one
could
see
him
from
the
hotel
very
likely
he
hid
behind
the
trees
whence
he
could
watch
the
road
a
cab
comes
up
the
hill
there
a
woman
in
it
not
quite
the
kind
of
woman
who
stays
at
your
hotel
ricardo
yet
she
must
be
going
to
your
hotel
for
the
road
ends
the
driver
is
nodding
on
his
box
refusing
to
pay
any
heed
to
his
fare
lest
again
she
should
bid
him
hurry
his
horse
is
moving
at
a
walk
wethermill
puts
his
head
in
at
the
window
and
asks
if
she
has
come
to
see
ricardo
anxious
for
her
four
thousand
francs
she
answers
perhaps
he
steps
into
the
cab
perhaps
as
he
walks
by
the
side
he
strikes
and
strikes
hard
and
strikes
surely
long
before
the
cab
reaches
the
hotel
he
is
back
again
on
the
verandah
yes
said
ricardo
it
the
daring
of
which
you
spoke
which
made
the
crime
possible
the
same
daring
which
made
him
seek
your
help
that
was
unexampled
no
replied
hanaud
there
an
historic
crime
in
your
own
country
monsieur
cries
for
help
were
heard
in
a
of
a
town
when
people
ran
to
answer
them
a
man
was
found
kneeling
by
a
corpse
it
was
the
kneeling
man
who
cried
for
help
but
it
was
also
the
kneeling
man
who
did
the
murder
i
remembered
that
when
i
first
began
to
suspect
harry
wethermill
ricardo
turned
eagerly
and
when
when
did
you
first
begin
to
suspect
harry
wethermill
hanaud
smiled
and
shook
his
head
that
you
shall
know
in
good
time
i
am
the
captain
of
the
ship
his
voice
took
on
a
deeper
note
but
i
prepare
you
listen
daring
and
brains
those
were
the
property
of
harry
wethermill
yes
but
it
is
not
he
who
is
the
chief
actor
in
the
crime
of
that
i
am
sure
he
was
no
more
than
one
of
the
instruments
one
of
the
instruments
used
then
by
whom
asked
ricardo
by
my
normandy
ricardo
said
hanaud
yes
the
dominating
figure
cruel
masterful
relentless
that
strange
woman
helene
vauquier
you
are
surprised
you
will
see
it
is
not
the
man
of
intellect
and
daring
it
my
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
but
she
free
exclaimed
ricardo
you
let
her
go
free
free
repeated
ricardo
she
was
driven
straight
from
the
villa
rose
to
the
depot
she
has
been
kept
au
secret
ever
since
ricardo
stared
in
amazement
already
you
knew
of
her
guilt
already
she
had
lied
to
me
in
her
description
of
adele
rossignol
do
you
remember
what
she
said
a
woman
with
beady
eyes
and
i
only
five
minutes
before
had
picked
up
from
the
table
this
he
opened
his
and
took
from
an
envelope
a
long
strand
of
red
hair
but
it
was
not
only
because
she
lied
that
i
had
her
taken
to
the
depot
a
pot
of
cold
cream
had
disappeared
from
the
room
of
mlle
celie
then
perrichet
after
all
was
right
perrichet
after
all
was
quite
wrong
not
to
hold
his
tongue
for
in
that
pot
of
cold
cream
as
i
was
sure
were
hidden
those
valuable
diamond
earrings
which
mlle
celie
habitually
wore
the
two
men
had
reached
the
square
in
front
of
the
etablissement
des
bains
ricardo
dropped
on
to
a
bench
and
wiped
his
forehead
but
i
am
in
a
maze
he
cried
my
head
turns
round
i
do
know
where
i
am
hanaud
stood
in
front
of
ricardo
smiling
he
was
not
displeased
with
his
companion
bewilderment
it
was
all
so
much
of
tribute
to
himself
i
am
the
captain
of
the
ship
he
said
his
smile
irritated
ricardo
who
spoke
impatiently
i
should
be
very
glad
he
said
if
you
would
tell
me
how
you
discovered
all
these
things
and
what
it
was
that
the
little
salon
on
the
first
morning
had
to
tell
to
you
and
why
celia
harland
ran
from
the
glass
doors
across
the
grass
to
the
and
again
from
the
carriage
into
the
house
on
the
lake
why
she
did
not
resist
yesterday
evening
why
she
did
not
cry
for
help
how
much
of
helene
evidence
was
true
and
how
much
false
for
what
reason
wethermill
concerned
himself
in
this
affair
oh
and
a
thousand
things
which
i
do
understand
ah
the
cushions
and
the
scrap
of
paper
and
the
aluminium
flask
said
hanaud
and
the
triumph
faded
from
his
face
he
spoke
now
to
ricardo
with
a
genuine
friendliness
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
if
i
keep
you
in
the
dark
for
a
little
while
i
too
ricardo
have
artistic
inclinations
i
will
not
spoil
the
remarkable
story
which
i
think
mlle
celie
will
be
ready
to
tell
us
afterwards
i
will
willingly
explain
to
you
what
i
read
in
the
evidences
of
the
room
and
what
so
greatly
puzzled
me
then
but
it
is
not
the
puzzle
or
its
solution
he
said
modestly
which
is
most
interesting
here
consider
the
people
mme
dauvray
the
old
rich
ignorant
woman
with
her
superstitions
and
her
generosity
her
desire
to
converse
with
mme
de
montespan
and
the
great
ladies
of
the
past
and
her
love
of
a
young
fresh
face
about
her
helene
vauquier
the
maid
with
her
six
years
of
confidential
service
who
finds
herself
suddenly
supplanted
and
made
to
tend
and
dress
in
dainty
frocks
the
girl
who
has
supplanted
her
the
young
girl
herself
that
poor
child
with
her
love
of
fine
clothes
the
bohemian
who
brought
up
amidst
trickeries
and
practising
them
as
a
profession
looking
upon
them
and
upon
misery
and
starvation
and
despair
as
the
commonplaces
of
life
keeps
a
simplicity
and
a
delicacy
and
a
freshness
which
would
have
withered
in
a
day
had
she
been
brought
up
otherwise
harry
wethermill
the
courted
and
successful
man
of
genius
just
imagine
if
you
can
what
his
feelings
must
have
been
when
in
mme
dauvray
bedroom
with
the
woman
he
had
uselessly
murdered
lying
rigid
beneath
the
sheet
he
saw
me
raise
the
block
of
wood
from
the
inlaid
floor
and
take
out
one
by
one
those
jewel
cases
for
which
less
than
twelve
hours
before
he
had
been
ransacking
that
very
room
but
what
he
must
have
felt
and
to
give
no
sign
oh
these
people
are
the
interesting
problems
in
this
story
let
us
hear
what
happened
on
that
terrible
night
the
puzzle
that
can
wait
in
ricardo
view
hanaud
was
proved
right
the
extraordinary
and
appalling
story
which
was
gradually
unrolled
of
what
had
happened
on
that
night
of
tuesday
in
the
villa
rose
exceeded
in
its
grim
interest
all
the
mystery
of
the
puzzle
but
it
was
not
told
at
once
the
trouble
at
first
with
mlle
celie
was
a
fear
of
sleep
she
dared
not
sleep
even
with
a
light
in
the
room
and
a
nurse
at
her
bedside
when
her
eyes
were
actually
closing
she
would
force
herself
desperately
back
into
the
living
world
for
when
she
slept
she
dreamed
through
again
that
dark
and
dreadful
night
of
tuesday
and
the
two
days
which
followed
it
until
at
some
moment
endurance
snapped
and
she
woke
up
screaming
but
youth
a
good
constitution
and
a
healthy
appetite
had
their
way
with
her
in
the
end
she
told
her
share
of
the
story
she
told
what
happened
there
was
apparently
one
terrible
scene
when
she
was
confronted
with
harry
wethermill
in
the
office
of
monsieur
fleuriot
the
juge
and
on
her
knees
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
face
besought
him
to
confess
the
truth
for
a
long
while
he
held
out
and
then
there
came
a
strange
and
human
turn
to
the
affair
adele
rossignol
or
to
give
her
real
name
adele
tace
the
wife
of
hippolyte
had
conceived
a
veritable
passion
for
harry
wethermill
he
was
of
a
not
uncommon
type
cold
and
callous
in
himself
yet
with
the
power
to
provoke
passion
in
women
and
adele
tace
as
the
story
was
told
of
how
harry
wethermill
had
paid
his
court
to
celia
harland
was
seized
with
a
vindictive
jealousy
hanaud
was
not
surprised
he
knew
the
of
his
country
brutal
passionate
treacherous
the
anonymous
letters
in
a
woman
handwriting
which
descend
upon
the
rue
de
jerusalem
and
betray
the
men
who
have
committed
thefts
had
left
him
no
illusions
upon
that
figure
in
the
history
of
crime
adele
rossignol
ran
forward
to
confess
so
that
harry
wethermill
might
suffer
to
the
last
possible
point
of
suffering
then
at
last
wethermill
gave
in
and
broken
down
by
the
ceaseless
interrogations
of
the
magistrate
confessed
in
his
turn
too
the
one
and
the
only
one
who
stood
firmly
throughout
and
denied
the
crime
was
helene
vauquier
her
thin
lips
were
kept
contemptuously
closed
whatever
the
others
might
admit
with
a
white
hard
face
quietly
and
respectfully
she
faced
the
magistrate
week
after
week
she
was
the
perfect
picture
of
a
servant
who
knew
her
place
and
nothing
was
wrung
from
her
but
without
her
help
the
story
became
complete
and
ricardo
was
at
pains
to
write
it
out
chapter
xv
celia
story
the
story
begins
with
the
explanation
of
that
circumstance
which
had
greatly
puzzled
ricardo
celia
entry
into
the
household
of
mme
dauvray
celia
father
was
a
captain
harland
of
a
marching
regiment
who
had
little
beyond
good
looks
and
excellent
manners
wherewith
to
support
his
position
he
was
extravagant
in
his
tastes
and
of
an
easy
mind
in
the
presence
of
embarrassments
to
his
other
disadvantages
he
added
that
of
falling
in
love
with
a
pretty
girl
no
better
off
than
himself
they
married
and
celia
was
born
for
nine
years
they
managed
through
the
wife
constant
devotion
to
struggle
along
and
to
give
their
daughter
an
education
then
however
celia
mother
broke
down
under
the
strain
and
died
captain
harland
a
couple
of
years
later
went
out
of
the
service
with
discredit
passed
through
the
bankruptcy
court
and
turned
showman
his
line
was
he
enlisted
the
services
of
his
daughter
taught
her
the
tricks
of
his
trade
and
became
the
great
fortinbras
of
the
captain
harland
would
move
amongst
the
audience
asking
the
spectators
in
a
whisper
to
think
of
a
number
or
of
an
article
in
their
pockets
after
the
usual
fashion
while
the
child
in
her
short
frock
with
her
long
fair
hair
tied
back
with
a
ribbon
would
stand
upon
the
platform
and
reel
off
the
answers
with
astonishing
rapidity
she
was
singularly
quick
singularly
receptive
the
undoubted
cleverness
of
the
performance
and
the
beauty
of
the
child
brought
to
them
a
temporary
prosperity
the
great
fortinbras
rose
from
the
to
the
assembly
rooms
of
provincial
towns
the
performance
became
genteel
and
ladies
flocked
to
the
matinees
the
great
fortinbras
dropped
his
pseudonym
and
became
once
more
captain
harland
as
celia
grew
up
he
tried
a
yet
higher
flight
he
became
a
spiritualist
with
celia
for
his
medium
the
entertainments
became
thrilling
seances
and
the
beautiful
child
now
grown
into
a
beautiful
girl
of
seventeen
created
a
greater
sensation
as
a
medium
in
a
trance
than
she
had
done
as
a
lightning
i
saw
no
harm
in
it
celia
explained
to
fleuriot
without
any
attempt
at
extenuation
i
never
understood
that
we
might
be
doing
any
hurt
to
any
one
people
were
interested
they
were
to
find
us
out
if
they
could
and
they
tried
to
and
they
could
i
looked
upon
it
quite
simply
in
that
way
it
was
just
my
profession
i
accepted
it
without
any
question
i
was
not
troubled
about
it
until
i
came
to
aix
a
startling
exposure
however
at
cambridge
discredited
the
craze
for
spiritualism
and
captain
harland
fortunes
declined
he
crossed
with
his
daughter
to
france
and
made
a
disastrous
tour
in
that
country
wasted
the
last
of
his
resources
in
the
casino
at
dieppe
and
died
in
that
town
leaving
celia
just
enough
money
to
bury
him
and
to
pay
her
fare
to
paris
there
she
lived
honestly
but
miserably
the
slimness
of
her
figure
and
a
grace
of
movement
which
was
particularly
hers
obtained
her
at
last
a
situation
as
a
mannequin
in
the
of
a
modiste
she
took
a
room
on
the
top
floor
of
a
house
in
the
rue
honore
and
settled
down
to
a
hard
and
penurious
life
i
was
not
happy
or
contented
no
said
celia
frankly
and
decisively
the
long
hours
in
the
close
rooms
gave
me
headaches
and
made
me
nervous
i
had
not
the
temperament
and
i
was
very
lonely
my
life
had
been
so
different
i
had
had
fresh
air
good
clothes
and
freedom
now
all
was
changed
i
used
to
cry
myself
to
sleep
up
in
my
little
room
wondering
whether
i
would
ever
have
friends
you
see
i
was
quite
young
only
eighteen
and
i
wanted
to
live
a
change
came
in
a
few
months
but
a
disastrous
change
the
modiste
failed
celia
was
thrown
out
of
work
and
could
get
nothing
to
do
gradually
she
pawned
what
clothes
she
could
spare
and
then
there
came
a
morning
when
she
had
a
single
piece
in
the
world
and
owed
a
month
rent
for
her
room
she
kept
the
piece
all
day
and
went
hungry
seeking
for
work
in
the
evening
she
went
to
a
provision
shop
to
buy
food
and
the
man
behind
the
counter
took
the
piece
he
looked
at
it
rung
it
on
the
counter
and
with
a
laugh
bent
it
easily
in
half
see
here
my
little
one
he
said
tossing
the
coin
back
to
her
one
does
not
buy
good
food
with
lead
celia
dragged
herself
out
of
the
shop
in
despair
she
was
starving
she
dared
not
go
back
to
her
room
the
thought
of
the
concierge
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
insistent
for
the
rent
frightened
her
she
stood
on
the
pavement
and
burst
into
tears
a
few
people
stopped
and
watched
her
curiously
and
went
on
again
finally
a
told
her
to
go
away
the
girl
moved
on
with
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
she
was
desperate
she
was
lonely
i
thought
of
throwing
myself
into
the
seine
said
celia
simply
in
telling
her
story
to
the
juge
indeed
i
went
to
the
river
but
the
water
looked
so
cold
so
terrible
and
i
was
young
i
wanted
so
much
to
live
and
then
the
night
came
and
the
lights
made
the
city
bright
and
i
was
very
tired
and
and
and
in
a
word
the
young
girl
went
up
to
montmartre
in
desperation
as
quickly
as
her
tired
legs
would
carry
her
she
walked
once
or
twice
timidly
past
the
restaurants
and
finally
entered
one
of
them
hoping
that
some
one
would
take
pity
on
her
and
give
her
some
supper
she
stood
just
within
the
door
of
the
people
pushed
past
her
men
in
evening
dress
women
in
bright
frocks
and
jewels
no
one
noticed
her
she
had
shrunk
into
a
corner
rather
hoping
not
to
be
noticed
now
that
she
had
come
but
the
novelty
of
her
surroundings
wore
off
she
knew
that
for
want
of
food
she
was
almost
fainting
there
were
two
girls
engaged
by
the
management
to
dance
amongst
the
tables
while
people
had
supper
one
dressed
as
a
page
in
blue
satin
and
the
other
as
a
spanish
dancer
both
girls
were
kind
they
spoke
to
celia
between
their
dances
they
let
her
waltz
with
them
still
no
one
noticed
her
she
had
no
jewels
no
fine
clothes
no
chic
the
three
indispensable
things
she
had
only
youth
and
a
pretty
face
but
said
celia
without
jewels
and
fine
clothes
and
chic
these
go
for
nothing
in
paris
at
last
however
mme
dauvray
came
in
with
a
party
of
friends
from
a
theatre
and
saw
how
unhappy
i
was
and
gave
me
some
supper
she
asked
me
about
myself
and
i
told
her
she
was
very
kind
and
took
me
home
with
her
and
i
cried
all
the
way
in
the
carriage
she
kept
me
a
few
days
and
then
she
told
me
that
i
was
to
live
with
her
for
often
she
was
lonely
too
and
that
if
i
would
she
would
some
day
find
me
a
nice
comfortable
husband
and
give
me
a
marriage
portion
so
all
my
troubles
seemed
to
be
at
an
end
said
celia
with
a
smile
within
a
fortnight
mme
dauvray
confided
to
celia
that
there
was
a
new
come
to
paris
who
by
looking
into
a
crystal
could
tell
the
most
wonderful
things
about
the
future
the
old
woman
eyes
kindled
as
she
spoke
she
took
celia
to
the
rooms
next
day
and
the
girl
quickly
understood
the
ruling
passion
of
the
woman
who
had
befriended
her
it
took
very
little
time
then
for
celia
to
notice
how
easily
mme
dauvray
was
duped
how
perpetually
she
was
robbed
celia
turned
the
problem
over
in
her
mind
madame
had
been
very
good
to
me
she
was
kind
and
simple
said
celia
with
a
very
genuine
affection
in
her
voice
the
people
whom
we
knew
laughed
at
her
and
were
ungenerous
but
there
are
many
women
whom
the
world
respects
who
are
worse
than
ever
was
poor
mme
dauvray
i
was
very
fond
of
her
so
i
proposed
to
her
that
we
should
hold
a
seance
and
i
would
bring
people
from
the
spirit
world
i
knew
that
i
could
amuse
her
with
something
much
more
clever
and
more
interesting
than
the
and
at
the
same
time
i
could
save
her
from
being
plundered
that
was
all
i
thought
about
that
was
all
she
thought
about
yes
she
left
helene
vauquier
out
of
her
calculations
and
she
did
not
foresee
the
effect
of
her
seances
upon
mme
dauvray
celia
had
no
suspicions
of
helene
vauquier
she
would
have
laughed
if
any
one
had
told
her
that
this
respectable
and
respectful
woman
who
was
so
attentive
so
neat
so
grateful
for
any
kindness
was
really
nursing
a
rancorous
hatred
against
her
celia
had
sprung
from
montmartre
suddenly
therefore
helene
vauquier
despised
her
celia
had
taken
her
place
in
mme
dauvray
confidence
had
deposed
her
unwittingly
had
turned
the
confidential
friend
into
a
mere
servant
therefore
helene
vauquier
hated
her
and
her
hatred
reached
out
beyond
the
girl
and
embraced
the
old
superstitious
foolish
woman
whom
a
young
and
pretty
face
could
so
easily
beguile
helene
vauquier
despised
them
both
hated
them
both
and
yet
must
nurse
her
rancour
in
silence
and
futility
then
came
the
seances
and
at
once
to
add
fuel
to
her
hatred
she
found
herself
stripped
of
those
gifts
and
commissions
which
she
had
exacted
from
the
herd
of
common
tricksters
who
had
been
wont
to
make
their
harvest
out
of
mme
dauvray
helene
vauquier
was
avaricious
and
greedy
like
so
many
of
her
class
her
hatred
of
celia
her
contempt
for
mme
dauvray
grew
into
a
very
delirium
but
it
was
a
delirium
she
had
the
cunning
to
conceal
she
lived
at
white
heat
but
to
all
the
world
she
had
lost
nothing
of
her
calm
celia
did
not
foresee
the
hatred
she
was
arousing
nor
on
the
other
hand
did
she
foresee
the
overwhelming
effect
of
these
spiritualistic
seances
on
mme
dauvray
celia
had
never
been
brought
quite
close
to
the
credulous
before
there
had
always
been
the
row
of
footlights
she
said
i
was
on
the
platform
the
audience
was
in
the
hall
or
if
it
was
at
a
house
my
father
made
the
arrangements
i
only
came
in
at
the
last
moment
played
my
part
and
went
away
it
was
never
brought
home
to
me
that
some
amongst
these
people
really
and
truly
believed
i
did
not
think
about
it
now
however
when
i
saw
mme
dauvray
so
feverish
so
excited
so
firmly
convinced
that
great
ladies
from
the
spirit
world
came
and
spoke
to
her
i
became
terrified
i
had
aroused
a
passion
which
i
had
not
suspected
i
tried
to
stop
the
seances
but
i
was
not
allowed
i
had
aroused
a
passion
which
i
could
not
control
i
was
afraid
that
mme
dauvray
whole
life
it
seems
absurd
to
those
who
did
not
know
her
but
those
who
did
will
understand
yes
her
whole
life
and
happiness
would
be
spoilt
if
she
discovered
that
what
she
believed
in
was
all
a
trick
she
spoke
with
a
simplicity
and
a
remorse
which
it
was
difficult
to
disbelieve
fleuriot
the
judge
now
at
last
convinced
that
the
dreyfus
affair
was
for
nothing
in
the
history
of
this
crime
listened
to
her
with
sympathy
that
is
your
explanation
mademoiselle
he
said
gently
but
i
must
tell
you
that
we
have
another
yes
monsieur
celia
asked
given
by
helene
vauquier
said
fleuriot
even
after
these
days
celia
could
not
hear
that
woman
name
without
a
shudder
of
fear
and
a
flinching
of
her
whole
body
her
face
grew
white
her
lips
dry
i
know
monsieur
that
helene
vauquier
is
not
my
friend
she
said
i
was
taught
that
very
cruelly
listen
mademoiselle
to
what
she
says
said
the
judge
and
he
read
out
to
celia
an
extract
or
two
from
hanaud
report
of
his
first
interview
with
helene
vauquier
in
her
bedroom
at
the
villa
rose
you
hear
what
she
says
dauvray
would
have
had
seances
all
day
but
mlle
celie
pleaded
that
she
was
left
exhausted
at
the
end
of
them
but
mlle
celie
was
of
an
address
and
again
speaking
of
mme
dauvray
queer
craze
that
the
spirit
of
mme
de
montespan
should
be
called
up
helene
vauquier
says
was
never
gratified
always
she
hoped
always
mlle
celie
tantalised
her
with
the
hope
she
would
not
spoil
her
fine
affairs
by
making
these
treats
too
common
thus
she
attributes
your
reluctance
to
multiply
your
experiments
to
a
desire
to
make
the
most
profit
possible
out
of
your
wares
like
a
good
business
woman
it
is
not
true
monsieur
cried
celia
earnestly
i
tried
to
stop
the
seances
because
now
for
the
first
time
i
recognised
that
i
had
been
playing
with
a
dangerous
thing
it
was
a
revelation
to
me
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
mme
dauvray
would
promise
me
everything
give
me
everything
if
only
i
would
consent
when
i
refused
i
was
terribly
frightened
of
what
would
happen
i
did
not
want
power
over
people
i
knew
it
was
not
good
for
her
that
she
should
suffer
so
much
excitement
no
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
so
we
all
moved
to
aix
and
there
she
met
harry
wethermill
on
the
second
day
after
her
arrival
and
proceeded
straightway
for
the
first
time
to
fall
in
love
to
celia
it
seemed
that
at
last
that
had
happened
for
which
she
had
so
longed
she
began
really
to
live
as
she
understood
life
at
this
time
the
day
until
she
met
harry
wethermill
was
one
flash
of
joyous
expectation
the
hours
when
they
were
together
a
time
of
contentment
which
thrilled
with
some
chance
meeting
of
the
hands
into
an
exquisite
happiness
mme
dauvray
understood
quickly
what
was
the
matter
and
laughed
at
her
affectionately
celie
my
dear
she
said
your
friend
wethermill
is
it
not
see
i
pronounce
your
tongue
will
not
be
as
comfortable
as
the
nice
fat
bourgeois
gentleman
i
meant
to
find
for
you
but
since
you
are
young
naturally
you
want
storms
and
there
will
be
storms
celie
she
concluded
with
a
laugh
celia
blushed
i
suppose
there
will
she
said
regretfully
there
were
indeed
moments
when
she
was
frightened
of
harry
wethermill
but
frightened
with
a
delicious
thrill
of
knowledge
that
he
was
only
stern
because
he
cared
so
much
but
in
a
day
or
two
there
began
to
intrude
upon
her
happiness
a
stinging
dissatisfaction
with
her
past
life
at
times
she
fell
into
melancholy
comparing
her
career
with
that
of
the
man
who
loved
her
at
times
she
came
near
to
an
extreme
irritation
with
helene
vauquier
her
lover
was
in
her
thoughts
as
she
put
it
herself
i
wanted
always
to
look
my
best
and
always
to
be
very
good
good
in
the
essentials
of
life
that
is
to
be
understood
she
had
lived
in
a
lax
world
she
was
not
particularly
troubled
by
the
character
of
her
associates
she
was
untouched
by
them
she
liked
her
fling
at
the
these
were
details
and
did
not
distress
her
love
had
not
turned
her
into
a
puritan
but
certain
recollections
plagued
her
soul
the
visit
to
the
restaurant
at
montmartre
for
instance
and
the
seances
of
these
indeed
she
thought
to
have
made
an
end
there
were
the
the
beauty
of
the
town
and
the
neighbourhood
to
distract
mme
dauvray
celia
kept
her
thoughts
away
from
seances
there
was
no
seance
as
yet
held
in
the
villa
rose
and
there
would
have
been
none
but
for
helene
vauquier
one
evening
however
as
harry
wethermill
walked
down
from
the
cercle
to
the
villa
des
fleurs
a
woman
voice
spoke
to
him
from
behind
monsieur
he
turned
and
saw
mme
dauvray
maid
he
stopped
under
a
street
lamp
and
said
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
woman
hesitated
i
hope
monsieur
will
pardon
me
she
said
humbly
i
am
committing
a
great
impertinence
but
i
think
monsieur
is
not
very
kind
to
mlle
celie
wethermill
stared
at
her
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
he
asked
angrily
helene
vauquier
looked
him
quietly
in
the
face
it
is
plain
monsieur
that
mlle
celie
loves
monsieur
monsieur
has
led
her
on
to
love
him
but
it
is
also
plain
to
a
woman
with
quick
eyes
that
monsieur
himself
cares
no
more
for
mademoiselle
than
for
the
button
on
his
coat
it
is
not
very
kind
to
spoil
the
happiness
of
a
young
and
pretty
girl
monsieur
nothing
could
have
been
more
respectful
than
the
manner
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
wethermill
was
taken
in
by
it
he
protested
earnestly
fearing
lest
the
maid
should
become
an
enemy
helene
it
is
not
true
that
i
am
playing
with
mlle
celie
why
should
i
not
care
for
her
helene
vauquier
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
question
needed
no
answer
why
should
i
seek
her
so
often
if
i
did
not
care
and
to
this
question
helene
vauquier
smiled
a
quiet
slow
confidential
smile
what
does
monsieur
want
of
mme
dauvray
she
asked
and
the
question
was
her
answer
wethermill
stood
silent
then
he
said
abruptly
nothing
of
course
nothing
and
he
walked
away
but
the
smile
remained
on
helene
vauquier
face
what
did
they
all
want
of
mme
dauvray
she
knew
very
well
it
was
what
she
herself
wanted
with
other
things
it
was
money
always
money
wethermill
was
not
the
first
to
seek
the
good
graces
of
mme
dauvray
through
her
pretty
companion
helene
vauquier
went
home
she
was
not
discontented
with
her
conversation
wethermill
had
paused
long
enough
before
he
denied
the
suggestion
of
her
words
she
approached
him
a
few
days
later
a
second
time
and
more
openly
she
was
shopping
in
the
rue
du
casino
when
he
passed
her
he
stopped
of
his
own
accord
and
spoke
to
her
helene
vauquier
kept
a
grave
and
respectful
face
but
there
was
a
pulse
of
joy
at
her
heart
he
was
coming
to
her
hand
monsieur
she
said
you
do
not
go
the
right
way
and
again
her
strange
smile
illuminated
her
face
mlle
celie
sets
a
guard
about
mme
dauvray
she
will
not
give
to
people
the
opportunity
to
find
madame
generous
oh
said
wethermill
slowly
is
that
so
and
he
turned
and
walked
by
helene
vauquier
side
never
speak
of
mme
dauvray
wealth
monsieur
if
you
would
keep
the
favour
of
mlle
celie
she
is
young
but
she
knows
her
world
i
have
not
spoken
of
money
to
her
replied
wethermill
and
then
he
burst
out
laughing
but
why
should
you
think
that
i
i
of
all
men
want
money
he
asked
and
helene
answered
him
again
enigmatically
if
i
am
wrong
monsieur
i
am
sorry
but
you
can
help
me
too
she
said
in
her
submissive
voice
and
she
passed
on
leaving
wethermill
rooted
to
the
ground
it
was
a
bargain
she
proposed
the
impertinence
of
it
it
was
a
bargain
she
proposed
the
value
of
it
in
that
shape
ran
harry
thoughts
he
was
in
desperate
straits
though
to
the
world
eye
he
was
a
man
of
wealth
a
gambler
with
no
inexpensive
tastes
he
had
been
always
in
need
of
money
the
rights
in
his
patent
he
had
mortgaged
long
ago
he
was
not
an
idler
he
was
no
sham
foisted
as
a
great
man
on
an
ignorant
public
he
had
really
some
touch
of
genius
and
he
cultivated
it
assiduously
but
the
harder
he
worked
the
greater
was
his
need
of
gaiety
and
extravagance
gifted
with
good
looks
and
a
charm
of
manner
he
was
popular
alike
in
the
great
world
and
the
world
of
bohemia
he
kept
and
wanted
to
keep
a
foot
in
each
that
he
was
in
desperate
straits
now
probably
helene
vauquier
alone
in
aix
had
recognised
she
had
drawn
her
inference
from
one
simple
fact
wethermill
asked
her
at
a
later
time
when
they
were
better
acquainted
how
she
had
guessed
his
need
monsieur
she
replied
you
were
in
aix
without
a
valet
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
of
that
class
of
men
who
would
never
move
without
a
valet
so
long
as
there
was
money
to
pay
his
wages
that
was
my
first
thought
then
when
i
saw
you
pursue
your
friendship
with
mlle
celie
you
who
so
clearly
to
my
eyes
did
not
love
her
i
felt
sure
on
the
next
occasion
that
the
two
met
it
was
again
harry
wethermill
who
sought
helene
vauquier
he
talked
for
a
minute
or
two
upon
indifferent
subjects
and
then
he
said
quickly
i
suppose
mme
dauvray
is
very
rich
she
has
a
great
fortune
in
jewels
said
helene
vauquier
wethermill
started
he
was
agitated
that
evening
the
woman
saw
his
hands
shook
his
face
twitched
clearly
he
was
hard
put
to
it
for
he
seldom
betrayed
himself
she
thought
it
time
to
strike
jewels
which
she
keeps
in
the
safe
in
her
bedroom
she
added
then
why
do
you
he
began
and
stopped
i
said
that
i
too
needed
help
replied
helene
without
a
ruffle
of
her
composure
it
was
nine
at
night
helene
vauquier
had
come
down
to
the
casino
with
a
wrap
for
mme
dauvray
the
two
people
were
walking
down
the
little
street
of
which
the
casino
blocks
the
end
and
it
happened
that
an
attendant
at
the
casino
named
alphonse
ruel
passed
them
recognised
them
both
and
smiled
to
himself
with
some
amusement
what
was
wethermill
doing
in
company
with
mme
dauvray
maid
ruel
had
no
doubt
ruel
had
seen
wethermill
often
enough
these
recent
days
with
mme
dauvray
pretty
companion
ruel
had
all
a
frenchman
sympathy
with
lovers
he
wished
them
well
those
two
young
and
attractive
people
and
hoped
that
the
maid
would
help
their
plans
but
as
he
passed
he
caught
a
sentence
spoken
suddenly
by
wethermill
well
it
is
true
i
must
have
money
and
the
agitated
voice
and
words
remained
fixed
in
his
memory
he
heard
too
a
warning
hush
from
the
maid
then
they
passed
out
of
his
hearing
but
he
turned
and
saw
that
wethermill
was
talking
volubly
what
harry
wethermill
was
saying
he
was
saying
in
a
foolish
burst
of
confidence
you
have
guessed
it
helene
you
alone
he
had
mortgaged
his
patent
twice
over
once
in
france
once
in
england
and
the
second
time
had
been
a
month
ago
he
had
received
a
large
sum
down
which
went
to
pay
his
pressing
creditors
he
had
hoped
to
pay
the
sum
back
from
a
new
invention
but
helene
i
tell
you
he
said
i
have
a
conscience
and
when
she
smiled
he
explained
oh
not
what
the
priests
would
call
a
conscience
that
i
know
but
none
the
less
i
have
a
conscience
a
conscience
about
the
things
which
really
matter
at
all
events
to
me
there
is
a
flaw
in
that
new
invention
it
can
be
improved
i
know
that
but
as
yet
i
do
not
see
how
and
i
can
not
help
it
i
must
get
it
right
i
can
not
let
it
go
imperfect
when
i
know
that
it
imperfect
when
i
know
that
it
can
be
improved
when
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
sooner
or
later
hit
upon
the
needed
improvement
that
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
i
have
a
conscience
helena
vauquier
smiled
indulgently
men
were
queer
fish
things
which
were
really
of
no
account
troubled
and
perplexed
them
and
gave
them
sleepless
nights
but
it
was
not
for
her
to
object
since
it
was
one
of
these
queer
anomalies
which
was
giving
her
her
chance
and
the
people
are
finding
out
that
you
have
sold
your
rights
twice
over
she
said
sympathetically
that
is
a
pity
monsieur
they
know
he
answered
those
in
england
know
and
they
are
very
angry
they
threaten
me
said
wethermill
they
give
me
a
month
to
restore
the
money
otherwise
there
will
be
disgrace
imprisonment
penal
servitude
helene
vauquier
walked
calmly
on
no
sign
of
the
intense
joy
which
she
felt
was
visible
in
her
face
and
only
a
trace
of
it
in
her
voice
monsieur
will
perhaps
meet
me
in
geneva
she
said
and
she
named
a
small
cafe
in
a
back
street
i
can
get
a
holiday
for
the
afternoon
and
as
they
were
near
to
the
villa
and
the
lights
she
walked
on
ahead
wethermill
loitered
behind
he
had
tried
his
luck
at
the
tables
and
had
failed
and
and
he
must
have
the
money
he
travelled
accordingly
the
next
day
to
geneva
and
was
there
presented
to
adele
tace
and
hippolyte
they
are
trusted
friends
of
mine
said
helene
vauquier
to
wethermill
who
was
not
inspired
to
confidence
by
the
sight
of
the
young
man
with
the
big
ears
and
the
plastered
hair
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
never
met
them
before
they
came
this
year
to
aix
the
tace
family
which
consisted
of
adele
and
her
husband
and
jeanne
her
mother
were
practised
criminals
they
had
taken
the
house
in
geneva
deliberately
in
order
to
carry
out
some
robberies
from
the
great
villas
on
the
but
they
had
not
been
fortunate
and
a
description
of
mme
dauvray
jewellery
in
the
woman
column
of
a
geneva
newspaper
had
drawn
adele
tace
over
to
aix
she
had
set
about
the
task
of
seducing
mme
dauvray
maid
and
found
a
master
not
an
instrument
in
the
small
cafe
on
that
afternoon
of
july
helene
vauquier
instructed
her
accomplices
quietly
and
methodically
as
though
what
she
proposed
was
the
most
ordinary
stroke
of
business
once
or
twice
subsequently
wethermill
who
was
the
only
safe
went
to
the
house
in
geneva
altering
his
hair
and
wearing
a
moustache
to
complete
the
arrangements
he
maintained
firmly
at
his
trial
that
at
none
of
these
meetings
was
there
any
talk
of
murder
to
be
sure
said
the
judge
with
a
savage
sarcasm
in
decent
conversation
there
is
always
a
reticence
something
is
left
to
be
understood
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
murder
could
not
have
been
an
essential
part
of
their
plan
since
let
us
see
what
happened
chapter
xvi
the
first
move
on
the
friday
before
the
crime
was
committed
mme
dauvray
and
celia
dined
at
the
villa
des
fleurs
while
they
were
drinking
their
coffee
harry
wethermill
joined
them
he
stayed
with
them
until
mme
dauvray
was
ready
to
move
and
then
all
three
walked
into
the
baccarat
rooms
together
but
there
in
the
throng
of
people
they
were
separated
harry
wethermill
was
looking
carefully
after
celia
as
a
good
lover
should
he
had
it
seemed
no
eyes
for
any
one
else
and
it
was
not
until
a
minute
or
two
had
passed
that
the
girl
herself
noticed
that
mme
dauvray
was
not
with
them
we
will
find
her
easily
said
harry
of
course
replied
celia
there
is
after
all
no
hurry
said
wethermill
with
a
laugh
and
perhaps
she
was
not
unwilling
to
leave
us
together
celia
dimpled
to
a
smile
mme
dauvray
is
kind
to
me
she
said
with
a
very
pretty
timidity
and
yet
more
kind
to
me
said
wethermill
in
a
low
voice
which
brought
the
blood
into
celia
cheeks
but
even
while
he
spoke
he
soon
caught
sight
of
mme
dauvray
standing
by
one
of
the
tables
and
near
to
her
was
adele
tace
adele
had
not
yet
made
mme
dauvray
acquaintance
that
was
evident
she
was
apparently
unaware
of
her
but
she
was
gradually
edging
towards
her
wethermill
smiled
and
celia
caught
the
smile
what
is
it
she
asked
and
her
head
began
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
mme
dauvray
why
i
like
your
frock
that
all
said
wethermill
at
once
and
celia
eyes
went
down
to
it
do
you
she
said
with
a
pleased
smile
it
was
a
dress
of
dark
blue
which
suited
her
well
i
am
glad
i
think
it
is
pretty
and
they
passed
on
wethermill
stayed
by
the
girl
side
throughout
the
evening
once
again
he
saw
mme
dauvray
and
adele
tace
but
now
they
were
together
now
they
were
talking
the
first
step
had
been
taken
adele
tace
had
scraped
acquaintance
with
mme
dauvray
celia
saw
them
almost
at
the
same
moment
oh
there
is
mme
dauvray
she
cried
taking
a
step
towards
her
wethermill
detained
the
girl
she
seems
quite
happy
he
said
and
indeed
mme
dauvray
was
talking
volubly
and
with
the
utmost
interest
the
jewels
sparkling
about
her
neck
she
raised
her
head
saw
celia
nodded
to
her
affectionately
and
then
pointed
her
out
to
her
companion
adele
tace
looked
the
girl
over
with
interest
and
smiled
contentedly
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
her
her
youth
her
very
daintiness
seemed
to
offer
her
as
the
easiest
of
victims
you
see
mme
dauvray
does
not
want
you
said
harry
wethermill
let
us
go
and
play
and
they
did
moving
off
into
one
of
the
further
rooms
it
was
not
until
another
hour
had
passed
that
celia
rose
and
went
in
search
of
mme
dauvray
she
found
her
still
talking
earnestly
to
adele
tace
mme
dauvray
got
up
at
once
are
you
ready
to
go
dear
she
asked
and
she
turned
to
adele
tace
this
is
celie
mme
rossignol
she
said
and
she
spoke
with
a
marked
significance
and
a
note
of
actual
exultation
in
her
voice
celia
however
was
not
unused
to
this
tone
mme
dauvray
was
proud
of
her
companion
and
had
a
habit
of
showing
her
off
to
the
discomfort
the
three
women
spoke
a
few
words
and
then
mme
dauvray
and
celia
left
the
rooms
and
walked
to
the
but
as
they
walked
celia
became
alarmed
she
was
by
nature
extraordinarily
sensitive
to
impressions
it
was
to
that
quick
receptivity
that
the
success
of
the
great
fortinbras
had
been
chiefly
due
she
had
a
gift
of
rapid
comprehension
it
was
not
that
she
argued
or
deducted
or
inferred
but
she
felt
to
take
a
metaphor
from
the
work
of
the
man
she
loved
she
was
a
natural
receiver
so
now
although
no
word
was
spoken
she
was
aware
that
mme
dauvray
was
greatly
excited
greatly
disturbed
and
she
dreaded
the
reason
of
that
excitement
and
disturbance
while
they
were
driving
home
in
the
she
said
apprehensively
you
met
a
friend
then
madame
no
said
mme
dauvray
i
made
a
friend
i
had
not
met
mme
rossignol
before
a
bracelet
of
hers
came
undone
and
i
helped
her
to
fasten
it
we
talked
afterwards
she
lives
in
geneva
mme
dauvray
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
then
she
turned
impulsively
and
spoke
in
a
voice
of
appeal
celie
we
talked
of
things
and
the
girl
moved
impatiently
she
understood
very
well
what
were
the
things
of
which
mme
dauvray
and
her
new
friend
had
talked
and
she
laughed
i
could
not
bear
it
celia
was
silent
and
mme
dauvray
went
on
in
a
voice
of
awe
i
told
her
of
the
wonderful
things
which
happened
when
i
sat
with
helene
in
the
dark
how
the
room
filled
with
strange
sounds
how
ghostly
fingers
touched
my
forehead
and
my
eyes
she
laughed
adele
rossignol
laughed
celie
i
told
her
of
the
spirits
with
whom
we
held
converse
she
would
not
believe
do
you
remember
the
evening
celie
when
mme
de
castiglione
came
back
an
old
old
woman
and
told
us
how
when
she
had
grown
old
and
had
lost
her
beauty
and
was
very
lonely
she
would
no
longer
live
in
the
great
house
which
was
so
full
of
torturing
memories
but
took
a
small
appartement
near
by
where
no
one
knew
her
and
how
she
used
to
walk
out
late
at
night
and
watch
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
the
dark
windows
which
had
been
once
so
bright
with
light
adele
rossignol
would
not
believe
i
told
her
that
i
had
found
the
story
afterwards
in
a
volume
of
memoirs
adele
rossignol
laughed
and
said
no
doubt
you
had
read
that
volume
yourself
before
the
seance
celia
stirred
guiltily
she
had
no
faith
in
you
celie
it
made
me
angry
dear
she
said
that
you
invented
your
own
tests
she
sneered
at
them
a
string
across
a
cupboard
a
child
she
said
could
manage
that
much
more
then
a
clever
young
lady
oh
she
admitted
that
you
were
clever
indeed
she
urged
that
you
were
far
too
clever
to
submit
to
the
tests
of
some
one
you
did
not
know
i
replied
that
you
would
i
was
right
celie
was
i
not
and
again
the
appeal
sounded
rather
piteously
in
mme
dauvray
voice
tests
said
celia
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
and
in
truth
she
was
not
afraid
of
them
mme
dauvray
voice
at
once
took
courage
there
she
cried
triumphantly
i
was
sure
i
told
her
so
celie
i
arranged
with
her
that
next
tuesday
and
celia
interrupted
quickly
no
oh
no
again
there
was
silence
and
then
mme
dauvray
said
gently
but
very
seriously
celie
you
are
not
kind
celia
was
moved
by
the
reproach
oh
madame
she
cried
eagerly
please
do
think
that
how
could
i
be
anything
else
to
you
who
are
so
kind
to
me
then
prove
it
celie
on
tuesday
i
have
asked
mme
rossignol
to
come
and
the
old
woman
voice
became
tremulous
with
excitement
and
perhaps
who
knows
perhaps
she
will
appear
to
us
celia
had
no
doubt
who
she
was
she
was
mme
de
montespan
oh
no
madame
she
stammered
here
at
aix
we
are
not
in
the
spirit
for
such
things
and
then
in
a
voice
of
dread
mme
dauvray
asked
is
it
true
then
what
adele
said
and
celia
started
violently
mme
dauvray
doubted
i
believe
it
would
break
my
heart
my
dear
if
i
were
to
think
that
if
i
were
to
know
that
you
had
tricked
me
she
said
with
a
trembling
voice
celia
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
it
would
be
true
she
had
no
doubt
of
it
mme
dauvray
would
never
forgive
herself
would
never
forgive
celia
her
infatuation
had
grown
so
to
engross
her
that
the
rest
of
her
life
would
surely
be
embittered
it
was
not
merely
a
passion
it
was
a
creed
as
well
celia
shrank
from
the
renewal
of
these
seances
every
fibre
in
her
was
in
revolt
they
were
so
unworthy
so
unworthy
of
harry
wethermill
and
of
herself
as
she
now
herself
wished
to
be
but
she
had
to
pay
now
the
moment
for
payment
had
come
celie
said
mme
dauvray
it
is
true
surely
it
is
true
celia
drew
her
hands
away
from
her
face
let
mme
rossignol
come
on
tuesday
she
cried
and
the
old
woman
caught
the
girl
hand
and
pressed
it
with
affection
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
cried
adele
rossignol
laughs
we
shall
convince
her
on
tuesday
celie
celie
i
am
so
glad
and
her
voice
sank
into
a
solemn
whisper
pathetically
ludicrous
it
is
not
right
that
she
should
laugh
to
bring
people
back
through
the
gates
of
the
that
is
wonderful
to
celia
the
sound
of
the
jargon
learnt
from
her
own
lips
used
by
herself
so
thoughtlessly
in
past
times
was
odious
for
the
last
time
she
pleaded
to
herself
all
her
life
was
going
to
change
though
no
word
had
yet
been
spoken
by
harry
wethermill
she
was
sure
of
it
just
for
this
one
last
time
then
so
that
she
might
leave
mme
dauvray
the
colours
of
her
belief
she
would
hold
a
seance
at
the
villa
rose
mme
dauvray
told
the
news
to
helene
vauquier
when
they
reached
the
villa
you
will
be
present
helene
she
cried
excitedly
it
will
be
tuesday
there
will
be
the
three
of
us
certainly
if
madame
wishes
said
helene
submissively
she
looked
round
the
room
mlle
celie
can
be
placed
on
a
chair
in
that
recess
and
the
curtains
drawn
whilst
we
madame
and
madame
friend
and
i
can
sit
round
this
table
under
the
side
windows
yes
said
celia
that
will
do
very
well
it
was
madame
dauvray
habit
when
she
was
particularly
pleased
with
celia
to
dismiss
her
maid
quickly
and
to
send
her
to
brush
the
hair
at
night
and
in
a
little
while
on
this
night
helene
went
to
celia
room
while
she
brushed
celia
hair
she
told
her
that
servettaz
parents
lived
at
chambery
and
that
he
would
like
to
see
them
but
the
poor
man
is
afraid
to
ask
for
a
day
she
said
he
has
been
so
short
a
time
with
madame
of
course
madame
will
give
him
a
holiday
if
he
asks
replied
celia
with
a
smile
i
will
speak
to
her
myself
it
would
be
kind
of
mademoiselle
said
helene
vauquier
but
perhaps
she
stopped
well
said
celia
perhaps
mademoiselle
would
do
better
still
to
speak
to
servattaz
himself
and
encourage
him
to
ask
with
his
own
lips
madame
has
her
moods
is
it
not
so
she
does
not
always
like
it
to
be
forgotten
that
she
is
the
mistress
on
the
next
day
accordingly
celia
did
speak
to
servettaz
and
servettaz
asked
for
his
holiday
but
of
course
mme
dauvray
at
once
replied
we
must
decide
upon
a
day
it
was
then
that
helene
vauquier
ventured
humbly
upon
a
suggestion
since
madame
has
a
friend
coming
here
on
tuesday
perhaps
that
would
be
the
best
day
for
him
to
go
madame
would
not
be
likely
to
take
a
long
drive
that
afternoon
no
indeed
replied
mme
dauvray
we
shall
all
three
dine
together
early
in
aix
and
return
here
then
i
will
tell
him
he
may
go
said
celia
for
this
conversation
took
place
on
the
monday
and
in
the
evening
mme
dauvray
and
celia
went
as
usual
to
the
villa
des
fleurs
and
dined
there
i
was
in
a
bad
mind
said
celia
when
asked
by
the
juge
to
explain
that
attack
of
nerves
in
the
garden
which
ricardo
had
witnessed
i
hated
more
and
more
the
thought
of
the
seance
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
i
felt
that
i
was
disloyal
to
harry
my
nerves
were
all
tingling
i
was
not
nice
that
night
at
all
she
added
quaintly
but
at
dinner
i
determined
that
if
i
met
harry
after
dinner
as
i
was
sure
to
do
i
would
tell
him
the
whole
truth
about
myself
however
when
i
did
meet
him
i
was
frightened
i
knew
how
stern
he
could
suddenly
look
i
dreaded
what
he
would
think
i
was
too
afraid
that
i
should
lose
him
no
i
could
not
speak
i
had
not
the
courage
that
made
me
still
more
angry
with
myself
and
so
i
i
quarrelled
at
once
with
harry
he
was
surprised
but
it
was
natural
was
it
what
else
should
one
do
under
such
circumstances
except
quarrel
with
the
man
one
loved
yes
i
really
quarrelled
with
him
and
said
things
which
i
thought
and
hoped
would
hurt
then
i
ran
away
from
him
lest
i
should
break
down
and
cry
i
went
to
the
tables
and
lost
at
once
all
the
money
i
had
except
one
note
of
five
louis
but
that
did
not
console
me
and
i
ran
out
into
the
garden
very
unhappy
there
i
behaved
like
a
child
and
ricardo
saw
me
but
it
was
not
the
little
money
i
had
lost
which
troubled
me
no
it
was
the
thought
of
what
a
coward
i
was
afterwards
harry
and
i
made
it
up
and
i
thought
like
the
little
fool
i
was
that
he
wanted
to
ask
me
to
marry
him
but
i
would
not
let
him
that
night
oh
i
wanted
him
to
ask
me
i
was
longing
for
him
to
ask
me
but
not
that
night
somehow
i
felt
that
the
seance
and
the
tricks
must
be
all
over
and
done
with
before
i
could
listen
or
answer
the
quiet
and
simple
confession
touched
the
magistrate
who
listened
to
it
with
profound
pity
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
the
sense
of
her
unworthiness
the
love
she
had
given
so
unstintingly
to
harry
wethermill
the
deep
pride
she
had
felt
in
the
delusion
that
he
loved
her
too
had
in
it
an
irony
too
bitter
but
he
was
aroused
to
anger
against
the
man
go
on
mademoiselle
he
said
but
in
spite
of
himself
his
voice
trembled
so
i
arranged
with
him
that
we
should
meet
on
wednesday
as
ricardo
heard
you
told
him
that
you
would
him
on
wednesday
said
the
judge
quoting
ricardo
words
yes
replied
celia
i
meant
that
the
last
word
of
all
these
deceptions
would
have
been
spoken
i
should
be
free
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
to
me
you
see
monsieur
i
was
so
sure
that
i
knew
what
it
was
he
had
to
say
to
me
and
her
voice
broke
upon
the
words
she
recovered
herself
with
an
effort
then
i
went
home
with
mme
dauvray
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
however
there
came
a
letter
from
adele
tace
of
which
no
trace
was
afterwards
discovered
the
letter
invited
mme
dauvray
and
celia
to
come
out
to
annecy
and
dine
with
her
at
an
hotel
there
they
could
then
return
together
to
aix
the
proposal
fitted
well
with
mme
dauvray
inclinations
she
was
in
a
feverish
mood
of
excitement
yes
it
will
be
better
that
we
dine
quietly
together
in
a
place
where
there
is
no
noise
and
no
crowd
and
where
no
one
knows
us
she
said
and
she
looked
up
the
there
is
a

said
so
we
need
not
spoil
holiday
his

will
be
expecting

helene

added
accordingly
servettaz
left
for
chambery
by
the
train
from
aix
and
later
on
in
the
afternoon
mme
dauvray
and
celia
went
by
train
to
annecy
in
the
one
woman
mind
was
the
queer
longing
that
she
should
appear
and
speak
in
the
girl
there
was
a
wish
passionate
as
a
cry
this
shall
be
the
last
time
she
said
to
herself
again
and
again
the
very
last
meanwhile
helene
vauquier
it
must
be
held
burnt
carefully
adele
taces
letter
she
was
left
in
the
villa
rose
with
the
charwoman
to
keep
her
company
the
charwoman
bore
testimony
that
helene
vauquier
certainly
did
burn
a
letter
in
the
and
that
after
she
had
burned
it
she
sat
for
a
long
time
rocking
herself
in
a
chair
with
a
smile
of
great
pleasure
upon
her
face
and
now
and
then
moistening
her
lips
with
her
tongue
but
helene
vauquier
kept
her
mouth
sealed
chapter
xvii
the
afternoon
of
tuesday
mme
dauvray
and
celia
found
adele
rossignol
to
give
adele
tace
the
name
which
she
assumed
waiting
for
them
impatiently
in
the
garden
of
an
hotel
at
annecy
on
the
promenade
du
paquier
she
was
a
tall
lithe
woman
and
she
was
dressed
by
the
purse
and
wish
of
helene
vauquier
in
a
robe
and
a
long
coat
of
sapphire
velvet
which
toned
down
the
coarseness
of
her
good
looks
and
lent
something
of
elegance
to
her
figure
so
it
is
mademoiselle
adele
began
with
a
smile
of
raillery
who
is
so
remarkably
clever
clever
answered
celia
looking
straight
at
adele
as
though
through
her
she
saw
mysteries
beyond
she
took
up
her
part
at
once
since
for
the
last
time
it
had
got
to
be
played
there
must
be
no
fault
in
the
playing
for
her
own
sake
for
the
sake
of
mme
dauvray
happiness
she
must
carry
it
off
with
success
the
suspicions
of
adele
rossignol
must
obtain
no
verification
she
spoke
in
a
quiet
and
most
serious
voice
under
no
one
is
clever
one
does
the
bidding
of
the
spirit
which
controls
perfectly
said
adele
in
a
malicious
tone
i
only
hope
you
will
see
to
it
mademoiselle
that
some
amusing
spirits
control
you
this
evening
and
appear
before
us
i
am
only
the
living
gate
by
which
the
spirit
forms
pass
from
the
realm
of
mind
into
the
world
of
matter
celia
replied
quite
so
said
adele
comfortably
now
let
us
be
sensible
and
dine
we
can
amuse
ourselves
with
mademoiselle
rigmaroles
afterwards
mme
dauvray
was
indignant
celia
for
her
part
felt
humiliated
and
small
they
sat
down
to
their
dinner
in
the
garden
but
the
rain
began
to
fall
and
drove
them
indoors
there
were
a
few
people
dining
at
the
same
hour
but
none
near
enough
to
overhear
them
alike
in
the
garden
and
the
adele
tace
kept
up
the
same
note
of
ridicule
and
disbelief
she
had
been
carefully
tutored
for
her
work
she
was
able
to
cite
the
stock
cases
of
exposure
les
freres
davenport
as
she
called
them
eusapia
palladino
and
slade
she
knew
the
precautions
which
had
been
taken
to
prevent
trickery
and
where
those
precautions
had
failed
her
whole
conversation
was
carefully
planned
to
one
end
and
to
one
end
alone
she
wished
to
produce
in
the
minds
of
her
companions
so
complete
an
impression
of
her
scepticism
that
it
would
seem
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
both
of
them
that
she
should
insist
upon
subjecting
celia
to
the
severest
tests
the
rain
ceased
and
they
took
their
coffee
on
the
terrace
of
the
hotel
mme
dauvray
had
been
really
pained
by
the
conversation
of
adele
tace
she
had
all
the
missionary
zeal
of
a
fanatic
i
do
hope
adele
that
we
shall
make
you
believe
but
we
shall
oh
i
am
confident
we
shall
and
her
voice
was
feverish
adele
dropped
for
the
moment
her
tone
of
raillery
i
am
not
unwilling
to
believe
she
said
but
i
can
not
i
am
interested
yes
you
see
how
much
i
have
studied
the
subject
but
i
can
not
believe
i
have
heard
stories
of
how
these
manifestations
are
produced
stories
which
make
me
laugh
i
can
not
help
it
the
tricks
are
so
easy
a
young
girl
wearing
a
black
frock
which
does
not
rustle
it
is
always
a
black
frock
is
it
not
because
a
black
frock
can
not
be
seen
in
the
dark
carrying
a
scarf
or
veil
with
which
she
can
make
any
sort
of
headdress
if
only
she
is
a
little
clever
and
shod
in
a
pair
of
slippers
is
shut
up
in
a
cabinet
or
placed
behind
a
screen
and
the
lights
are
turned
down
or
out
adele
broke
off
with
a
comic
shrug
of
the
shoulders
bah
it
ought
not
to
deceive
a
child
celia
sat
with
a
face
which
would
grow
red
she
did
not
look
but
none
the
less
she
was
aware
that
mme
dauvray
was
gazing
at
her
with
a
perplexed
frown
and
some
return
of
her
suspicion
showing
in
her
eyes
adele
tace
was
not
content
to
leave
the
subject
there
perhaps
she
said
with
a
smile
mlle
celie
dresses
in
that
way
for
a
seance
madame
shall
see
celia
stammered
and
camille
dauvray
rather
sternly
repeated
her
words
yes
adele
shall
see
i
myself
will
decide
what
you
shall
wear
celie
adele
tace
casually
suggested
the
kind
of
dress
which
she
would
prefer
something
light
in
colour
with
a
train
something
which
will
hiss
and
whisper
if
mademoiselle
moves
about
the
room
yes
and
i
think
one
of
mademoiselle
big
hats
she
said
we
will
have
mademoiselle
as
modern
as
possible
so
that
when
the
great
ladies
of
the
past
appear
in
the
coiffure
of
their
day
we
may
be
sure
it
is
not
mlle
celie
who
represents
them
i
will
speak
to
helene
said
mme
dauvray
and
adele
tace
was
content
there
was
a
particular
new
dress
of
which
she
knew
and
it
was
very
desirable
that
mlle
celie
should
wear
it
for
one
thing
if
celia
wore
it
it
would
help
the
theory
that
she
had
put
it
on
because
she
expected
that
night
a
lover
for
another
with
that
dress
there
went
a
pair
of
satin
slippers
which
had
just
come
home
from
a
shoemaker
at
aix
and
which
would
leave
upon
soft
mould
precisely
the
same
imprints
as
the
grey
suede
shoes
which
the
girl
was
wearing
now
celia
was
not
greatly
disconcerted
by
mme
rossignol
precautions
she
would
have
to
be
a
little
more
careful
and
mme
de
montespan
would
be
a
little
longer
in
responding
to
the
call
of
mme
dauvray
than
most
of
the
other
dead
ladies
of
the
past
had
been
but
that
was
all
she
was
however
really
troubled
in
another
way
all
through
dinner
at
every
word
of
the
conversation
she
had
felt
her
reluctance
towards
this
seance
swelling
into
a
positive
disgust
more
than
once
she
had
felt
driven
by
some
uncontrollable
power
to
rise
up
at
the
table
and
cry
out
to
adele
you
are
right
it
is
trickery
there
is
no
truth
in
it
but
she
had
mastered
herself
for
opposite
to
her
sat
her
patroness
her
good
friend
the
woman
who
had
saved
her
the
flush
upon
mme
dauvray
cheeks
and
the
agitation
of
her
manner
warned
celia
how
much
hung
upon
the
success
of
this
last
seance
how
much
for
both
of
them
and
in
the
fullness
of
that
knowledge
a
great
fear
assailed
her
she
began
to
be
afraid
so
strong
was
her
reluctance
that
she
would
not
bring
her
heart
into
the
task
suppose
i
failed
because
i
could
not
force
myself
to
wish
not
to
fail
she
thought
and
she
steeled
herself
against
the
thought
she
must
not
fail
for
apart
altogether
from
mme
dauvray
happiness
her
own
it
seemed
was
at
stake
too
it
must
be
from
my
lips
that
harry
learns
what
i
have
been
she
said
to
herself
and
with
the
resolve
she
strengthened
herself
i
will
wear
what
you
please
she
said
with
a
smile
i
only
wish
mme
rossignol
to
be
satisfied
and
i
shall
be
said
adele
if
she
leaned
forward
in
anxiety
she
had
come
to
the
real
necessity
of
helene
vauquier
plan
if
we
abandon
as
quite
laughable
the
cupboard
door
and
the
string
across
it
if
in
a
word
mademoiselle
consents
that
we
tie
her
hand
and
foot
and
fasten
her
securely
in
a
chair
such
restraints
are
usual
in
the
experiments
of
which
i
have
read
was
there
not
a
medium
called
mlle
cook
who
was
secured
in
this
way
and
then
remarkable
things
which
i
could
not
believe
were
supposed
to
have
happened
certainly
i
permit
it
said
celia
with
indifference
and
mme
dauvray
cried
enthusiastically
ah
you
shall
believe
in
those
wonderful
things
adele
tace
leaned
back
she
drew
a
breath
it
was
a
breath
of
relief
then
we
will
buy
the
cord
in
aix
she
said
we
have
some
no
doubt
in
the
house
said
mme
dauvray
adele
shook
her
head
and
smiled
my
dear
madame
you
are
dealing
with
a
sceptic
i
should
not
be
content
celia
shrugged
her
shoulders
let
us
satisfy
mme
rossignol
she
said
celia
indeed
was
not
alarmed
by
this
last
precaution
for
her
it
was
a
test
less
difficult
than
the
rustling
robe
she
had
appeared
upon
so
many
platforms
had
experienced
too
often
the
bungling
efforts
of
spectators
called
up
from
the
audience
to
be
in
any
fear
there
were
very
few
knots
from
which
her
small
hands
and
supple
fingers
had
not
learnt
long
since
to
extricate
themselves
she
was
aware
how
much
in
all
these
matters
the
personal
equation
counted
men
who
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
tie
knots
from
which
she
could
not
get
free
were
always
too
uncomfortable
and
or
too
afraid
of
hurting
her
white
arms
and
wrists
to
do
it
women
on
the
other
hand
who
had
no
compunctions
of
that
kind
did
not
know
how
it
was
now
nearly
eight
the
rain
still
held
off
we
must
go
said
mme
dauvray
who
for
the
last
had
been
continually
looking
at
her
watch
they
drove
to
the
station
and
took
the
train
once
more
the
rain
came
down
but
it
had
stopped
again
before
the
train
steamed
into
aix
at
nine
we
will
take
a
cab
said
mme
dauvray
it
will
save
time
it
will
do
us
good
to
walk
madame
pleaded
adele
the
train
was
full
adele
passed
quickly
out
from
the
lights
of
the
station
in
the
throng
of
passengers
and
waited
in
the
dark
square
for
the
others
to
join
her
it
is
barely
nine
a
friend
has
promised
to
call
at
the
villa
rose
for
me
after
eleven
and
drive
me
back
in
a
to
geneva
so
we
have
plenty
of
time
they
walked
accordingly
up
the
hill
mme
dauvray
slowly
since
she
was
stout
and
celia
keeping
pace
with
her
thus
it
seemed
natural
that
adele
tace
should
walk
ahead
though
a
would
not
have
thought
she
was
of
their
company
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
casino
adele
waited
for
them
and
said
quickly
mademoiselle
you
can
get
some
cord
i
think
at
the
shop
there
and
she
pointed
to
the
shop
of
corval
madame
and
i
will
go
slowly
on
you
who
are
the
youngest
will
easily
catch
us
up
celia
went
into
the
shop
bought
the
cord
and
caught
mme
dauvray
up
before
she
reached
the
villa
where
is
mme
rossignol
she
asked
she
went
on
said
camille
dauvray
she
walks
faster
than
i
do
they
passed
no
one
whom
they
knew
although
they
did
pass
one
who
recognised
them
as
perrichet
had
discovered
they
came
upon
adele
waiting
for
them
at
the
corner
of
the
road
where
it
turns
down
toward
the
villa
it
is
near
here
the
villa
rose
she
asked
a
minute
more
and
we
are
there
they
turned
in
at
the
drive
closed
the
gate
behind
them
and
walked
up
to
the
villa
the
windows
and
the
glass
doors
were
closed
the
latticed
shutters
fastened
a
light
burned
in
the
hall
helene
is
expecting
us
said
mme
dauvray
for
as
they
approached
she
saw
the
front
door
open
to
admit
them
and
helene
vauquier
in
the
doorway
the
three
women
went
straight
into
the
little
salon
which
was
ready
with
the
lights
up
and
a
small
fire
burning
celia
noticed
the
fire
with
a
trifle
of
dismay
she
moved
a
in
front
of
it
i
can
understand
why
you
do
that
mademoiselle
said
adele
rossignol
with
a
satirical
smile
but
mme
dauvray
came
to
the
girl
help
she
is
right
adele
light
is
the
great
barrier
between
us
and
the
she
said
solemnly
meanwhile
in
the
hall
helene
vauquier
locked
and
bolted
the
front
door
then
she
stood
motionless
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
and
a
heart
beating
high
all
through
that
afternoon
she
had
been
afraid
that
some
accident
at
the
last
moment
would
spoil
her
plan
that
adele
tace
had
not
learned
her
lesson
that
celie
would
take
fright
that
she
would
not
return
now
all
those
fears
were
over
she
had
her
victims
safe
within
the
villa
the
charwoman
had
been
sent
home
she
had
them
to
herself
she
was
still
standing
in
the
hall
when
mme
dauvray
called
aloud
impatiently
helene
helene
and
when
she
entered
the
salon
there
was
still
as
celia
was
able
to
recall
some
trace
of
her
smile
lingering
upon
her
face
adele
rossignol
had
removed
her
hat
and
was
taking
off
her
gloves
mme
dauvray
was
speaking
impatiently
to
celia
we
will
arrange
the
room
dear
while
helene
helps
you
to
dress
it
will
be
quite
easy
we
shall
use
the
recess
and
celia
as
she
ran
up
the
stairs
heard
mme
dauvray
discussing
with
her
maid
what
frock
she
should
wear
she
was
hot
and
she
took
a
hurried
bath
when
she
came
from
her
bathroom
she
saw
with
dismay
that
it
was
her
new
evening
gown
which
had
been
laid
out
it
was
the
last
which
she
would
have
chosen
but
she
dared
not
refuse
it
she
must
still
any
suspicion
she
must
succeed
she
gave
herself
into
helene
hands
celia
remembered
afterwards
one
or
two
points
which
passed
barely
heeded
at
the
time
once
while
helene
was
dressing
her
hair
she
looked
up
at
the
maid
in
the
mirror
and
noticed
a
strange
and
rather
horrible
grin
upon
her
face
which
disappeared
the
moment
their
eyes
met
then
again
helene
was
extraordinarily
slow
and
extraordinarily
fastidious
that
evening
nothing
satisfied
her
neither
the
hang
of
the
girl
skirt
the
folds
of
her
sash
nor
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
come
helene
be
quick
said
celia
you
know
how
madame
hates
to
be
kept
waiting
at
these
times
you
might
be
dressing
me
to
go
to
meet
my
lover
she
added
with
a
blush
and
a
smile
at
her
own
pretty
reflection
in
the
glass
and
a
queer
look
came
upon
helene
face
for
it
was
at
creating
just
this
very
impression
that
she
aimed
very
well
mademoiselle
said
helene
and
even
as
she
spoke
mme
dauvray
voice
rang
shrill
and
irritable
up
the
stairs
celie
celie
quick
helene
said
celia
for
she
herself
was
now
anxious
to
have
the
seance
over
and
done
with
but
helene
did
not
hurry
the
more
irritable
mme
dauvray
became
the
more
impatient
with
mlle
celie
the
less
would
mlle
celie
dare
to
refuse
the
tests
adele
wished
to
impose
upon
her
but
that
was
not
all
she
took
a
subtle
and
ironic
pleasure
in
decking
out
her
victim
natural
loveliness
her
face
her
slender
throat
her
white
shoulders
should
look
their
prettiest
her
grace
of
limb
and
figure
should
be
more
alluring
than
ever
before
the
same
words
indeed
were
running
through
both
women
minds
for
the
last
time
said
celia
to
herself
thinking
of
these
horrible
seances
of
which
should
see
the
end
for
the
last
time
said
helene
vauquier
too
for
the
last
time
she
laced
the
girl
dress
there
would
be
no
more
patient
and
careful
service
for
mlle
celie
after
but
she
should
have
it
and
to
spare
she
should
be
conscious
that
her
beauty
had
never
made
so
strong
an
appeal
that
she
was
never
so
fit
for
life
as
at
the
moment
when
the
end
had
come
one
thing
helene
regretted
she
would
have
liked
celia
celia
smiling
at
herself
in
the
glass
to
know
suddenly
what
was
in
store
for
her
she
saw
in
imagination
the
colour
die
from
the
cheeks
the
eyes
stare
wide
with
terror
celie
celie
again
the
impatient
voice
rang
up
the
stairs
as
helene
pinned
the
girl
hat
upon
her
fair
head
celie
sprang
up
took
a
quick
step
or
two
towards
the
door
and
stopped
in
dismay
the
swish
of
her
long
satin
train
must
betray
her
she
caught
up
the
dress
and
tried
again
even
so
the
rustle
of
it
was
heard
i
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
you
will
help
me
helene
of
course
mademoiselle
i
will
sit
underneath
the
switch
of
the
light
in
the
salon
if
madame
your
visitor
makes
the
experiment
too
difficult
i
will
find
a
way
to
help
you
said
helene
vauquier
and
as
she
spoke
she
handed
celia
a
long
pair
of
white
gloves
i
shall
not
want
them
said
celia
mme
dauvray
ordered
me
to
give
them
to
you
replied
helene
celia
took
them
hurriedly
picked
up
a
white
scarf
of
tulle
and
ran
down
the
stairs
helene
vauquier
listened
at
the
door
and
heard
madame
voice
in
feverish
anger
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
celie
you
have
been
an
age
helene
vauquier
laughed
softly
to
herself
took
out
celia
white
frock
from
the
wardrobe
turned
off
the
lights
and
followed
her
down
to
the
hall
she
placed
the
cloak
just
outside
the
door
of
the
salon
then
she
carefully
turned
out
all
the
lights
in
the
hall
and
in
the
kitchen
and
went
into
the
salon
the
rest
of
the
house
was
in
darkness
this
room
was
brightly
lit
and
it
had
been
made
ready
chapter
xviii
the
seance
helene
vauquier
locked
the
door
of
the
salon
upon
the
inside
and
placed
the
key
upon
the
as
she
had
always
done
whenever
a
seance
had
been
held
the
curtains
had
been
loosened
at
the
sides
of
the
arched
recess
in
front
of
the
glass
doors
ready
to
be
drawn
across
inside
the
recess
against
one
of
the
pillars
which
supported
the
arch
a
high
stool
without
a
back
taken
from
the
hall
had
been
placed
and
the
back
legs
of
the
stool
had
been
lashed
with
cord
firmly
to
the
pillar
so
that
it
could
not
be
moved
the
round
table
had
been
put
in
position
with
three
chairs
about
it
mme
dauvray
waited
impatiently
celia
stood
apparently
unconcerned
apparently
lost
to
all
that
was
going
on
her
eyes
saw
no
one
adele
looked
up
at
celia
and
laughed
maliciously
mademoiselle
i
see
is
in
the
very
mood
to
produce
the
most
wonderful
phenomena
but
it
will
be
better
i
think
madame
she
said
turning
to
mme
dauvray
that
mlle
celie
should
put
on
those
gloves
which
i
see
she
has
thrown
on
to
a
chair
it
will
be
a
little
more
difficult
for
mademoiselle
to
loosen
these
cords
should
she
wish
to
do
so
the
argument
silenced
celia
if
she
refused
this
condition
now
she
would
excite
mme
dauvray
to
a
terrible
suspicion
she
drew
on
her
gloves
ruefully
and
slowly
smoothed
them
over
her
elbows
and
buttoned
them
to
free
her
hands
with
her
fingers
and
wrists
already
hampered
in
gloves
would
not
be
so
easy
a
task
but
there
was
no
escape
adele
rossignol
was
watching
her
with
a
satiric
smile
mme
dauvray
was
urging
her
to
be
quick
obeying
a
second
order
the
girl
raised
her
skirt
and
extended
a
slim
foot
in
a
silk
stocking
and
a
satin
slipper
to
match
adele
was
content
celia
was
wearing
the
shoes
she
was
meant
to
wear
they
were
made
upon
the
very
same
last
as
those
which
celia
had
just
kicked
off
upstairs
an
almost
imperceptible
nod
from
helene
vauquier
moreover
assured
her
she
took
up
a
length
of
the
thin
cord
now
how
are
we
to
begin
she
said
awkwardly
i
think
i
will
ask
you
mademoiselle
to
put
your
hands
behind
you
celia
turned
her
back
and
crossed
her
wrists
she
stood
in
her
satin
frock
with
her
white
arms
and
shoulders
bare
her
slender
throat
supporting
her
small
head
with
its
heavy
curls
her
big
hat
a
picture
of
young
grace
and
beauty
she
would
have
had
an
easy
task
that
night
had
there
been
men
instead
of
women
to
put
her
to
the
test
but
the
women
were
intent
upon
their
own
ends
mme
dauvray
eager
for
her
seance
adele
tace
and
helene
vauquier
for
the
climax
of
their
plot
celia
clenched
her
hands
to
make
the
muscles
of
her
wrists
rigid
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
cord
adele
quietly
unclasped
them
and
placed
them
palm
to
palm
and
at
once
celia
became
uneasy
it
was
not
merely
the
action
significant
though
it
was
of
adele
alertness
to
thwart
her
which
troubled
celia
but
she
was
extraordinarily
receptive
of
impressions
extraordinarily
quick
to
feel
from
a
touch
some
dim
sensation
of
the
thought
of
the
one
who
touched
her
so
now
the
touch
of
adele
swift
strong
nervous
hands
caused
her
a
queer
vague
shock
of
discomfort
it
was
no
more
than
that
at
the
moment
but
it
was
quite
definite
as
that
keep
your
hands
so
please
mademoiselle
said
adele
your
fingers
loose
and
the
next
moment
celia
winced
and
had
to
bite
her
lip
to
prevent
a
cry
the
thin
cord
was
wound
twice
about
her
wrists
drawn
cruelly
tight
and
then
cunningly
knotted
for
one
second
celia
was
thankful
for
her
gloves
the
next
more
than
ever
she
regretted
that
she
wore
them
it
would
have
been
difficult
enough
for
her
to
free
her
hands
now
even
without
them
and
upon
that
a
worse
thing
befell
her
i
beg
mademoiselle
pardon
if
i
hurt
her
said
adele
and
she
tied
the
girl
thumbs
and
little
fingers
to
slacken
the
knots
she
must
have
the
use
of
her
fingers
even
though
her
gloves
made
them
fumble
now
she
had
lost
the
use
of
them
altogether
she
began
to
feel
that
she
was
in
she
was
sure
of
it
the
next
instant
for
adele
stood
up
and
passing
a
cord
round
the
upper
part
of
her
arms
drew
her
elbows
back
to
bring
any
strength
to
help
her
in
wriggling
her
hands
free
she
must
be
able
to
raise
her
elbows
with
them
trussed
in
the
small
of
her
back
she
was
robbed
entirely
of
her
strength
and
all
the
time
her
strange
uneasiness
grew
she
made
a
movement
of
revolt
and
at
once
the
cord
was
loosened
mlle
celie
objects
to
my
tests
said
adele
with
a
laugh
to
mme
dauvray
and
i
do
not
wonder
celia
saw
upon
the
old
woman
foolish
and
excited
face
a
look
of
veritable
consternation
are
you
afraid
celie
she
asked
there
was
anger
there
was
menace
in
the
voice
but
above
all
these
there
was
fear
fear
that
her
illusions
were
to
tumble
about
her
celia
heard
that
note
and
was
quelled
by
it
this
folly
of
belief
these
seances
were
the
one
touch
of
colour
in
mme
dauvray
life
and
it
was
just
that
instinctive
need
of
colour
which
had
made
her
so
easy
to
delude
how
strong
the
need
is
how
seductive
the
proposal
to
supply
it
celia
knew
well
she
knew
it
from
the
experience
of
her
life
when
the
great
fortinbras
was
at
the
climax
of
his
fortunes
she
had
travelled
much
amongst
monotonous
drab
towns
without
character
or
amusements
she
had
kept
her
eyes
open
she
had
seen
that
it
was
from
the
denizens
of
the
dull
streets
in
these
towns
that
the
quack
religions
won
their
recruits
mme
dauvray
life
had
been
a
featureless
sort
of
affair
until
these
experiments
had
come
to
colour
it
madame
dauvray
must
at
any
rate
preserve
the
memory
of
that
colour
no
she
said
boldly
i
am
not
afraid
and
after
that
she
moved
no
more
her
elbows
were
drawn
firmly
back
and
tightly
bound
she
was
sure
she
could
not
free
them
she
glanced
in
despair
at
helene
vauquier
and
then
some
glimmer
of
hope
sprang
up
for
helene
vauquier
gave
her
a
look
a
smile
of
reassurance
it
was
as
if
she
said
i
will
come
to
your
help
then
to
make
security
still
more
sure
adele
turned
the
girl
about
as
unceremoniously
as
if
she
had
been
a
doll
and
passing
a
cord
at
the
back
of
her
arms
drew
both
ends
round
in
front
and
knotted
them
at
her
waist
now
celie
said
adele
with
a
vibration
in
her
voice
which
celia
had
not
remarked
before
excitement
was
gaining
upon
her
as
upon
mme
dauvray
her
face
was
flushed
and
shiny
her
manner
peremptory
and
quick
celia
uneasiness
grew
into
fear
she
could
have
used
the
words
which
hanaud
spoke
the
next
day
in
that
very
room
there
is
something
here
which
i
do
not
understand
the
touch
of
adele
tace
hands
communicated
something
to
her
something
which
filled
her
with
a
vague
alarm
she
could
not
have
formulated
it
if
she
would
she
dared
not
if
she
could
she
had
but
to
stand
and
submit
now
said
adele
she
took
the
girl
by
the
shoulders
and
set
her
in
a
clear
space
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
back
to
the
recess
her
face
to
the
mirror
where
all
could
see
her
now
celie
she
had
dropped
the
mlle
and
the
ironic
suavity
of
her
manner
try
to
free
yourself
for
a
moment
the
girl
shoulders
worked
her
hands
fluttered
but
they
remained
helplessly
bound
ah
you
will
be
content
adele
cried
mme
dauvray
eagerly
but
even
in
the
midst
of
her
eagerness
so
thoroughly
had
she
been
prepared
there
lingered
a
flavour
of
doubt
of
suspicion
in
mind
there
was
still
the
one
desperate
resolve
i
must
succeed
she
said
to
herself
i
must
adele
rossignol
kneeled
on
the
floor
behind
her
she
gathered
in
carefully
the
girl
frock
then
she
picked
up
the
long
train
wound
it
tightly
round
her
limbs
pinioning
and
swathing
them
in
the
folds
of
satin
and
secured
the
folds
with
a
cord
about
the
knees
she
stood
up
again
can
you
walk
celie
she
asked
try
with
helene
vauquier
to
support
her
if
she
fell
celia
took
a
tiny
shuffling
step
forward
feeling
supremely
ridiculous
no
one
however
of
her
audience
was
inclined
to
laugh
to
mme
dauvray
the
whole
business
was
as
serious
as
the
most
solemn
ceremonial
adele
was
intent
upon
making
her
knots
secure
helene
vauquier
was
the
servant
who
knew
her
place
it
was
not
for
her
to
laugh
at
her
young
mistress
in
however
ludicrous
a
situation
she
might
be
now
said
adele
we
will
tie
mademoiselle
ankles
and
then
we
shall
be
ready
for
mme
de
montespan
the
raillery
in
her
voice
had
a
note
of
savagery
in
it
now
vague
terror
grew
she
had
a
feeling
that
a
beast
was
waking
in
the
woman
and
with
it
came
a
growing
premonition
of
failure
vainly
she
cried
to
herself
i
must
not
fail
but
she
felt
instinctively
that
there
was
a
stronger
personality
than
her
own
in
that
room
taming
her
condemning
her
to
failure
influencing
the
others
she
was
placed
in
a
chair
adele
passed
a
cord
round
her
ankles
and
the
mere
touch
of
it
quickened
celia
to
a
spasm
of
revolt
her
last
little
remnant
of
liberty
was
being
taken
from
her
she
raised
herself
or
rather
would
have
raised
herself
but
helene
with
gentle
hands
held
her
in
the
chair
and
whispered
under
her
breath
have
no
fear
madame
is
watching
adele
looked
fiercely
up
into
the
girl
face
keep
still
hein
la
petite
she
cried
and
the
epithet
little
one
was
a
light
to
celia
till
now
upon
these
occasions
with
her
black
ceremonial
dress
her
air
of
aloofness
her
vague
eyes
and
the
dignity
of
her
carriage
she
had
already
produced
some
part
of
their
effect
before
the
seance
had
begun
she
had
been
wont
to
sail
into
the
room
distant
mystical
she
had
her
audience
already
expectant
of
mysteries
prepared
for
marvels
her
work
was
already
half
done
but
now
of
all
that
help
she
was
deprived
she
was
no
longer
a
person
aloof
a
prophetess
a
seer
of
visions
she
was
simply
a
girl
of
trussed
up
in
a
ridiculous
and
painful
position
that
was
all
the
dignity
was
gone
and
the
more
she
realised
that
the
more
she
was
hindered
from
influencing
her
audience
the
less
able
she
was
to
concentrate
her
mind
upon
them
to
will
them
to
favour
her
mme
dauvray
suspicions
she
was
sure
were
still
awake
she
could
not
quell
them
there
was
a
stronger
personality
than
hers
at
work
in
the
room
the
cord
bit
through
her
thin
stockings
into
her
ankles
she
dared
not
complain
it
was
savagely
tied
she
made
no
remonstrance
and
then
helene
vauquier
raised
her
up
from
the
chair
and
lifted
her
easily
off
the
ground
for
a
moment
she
held
her
so
if
celia
had
felt
ridiculous
before
she
knew
that
she
was
ten
times
more
so
now
she
could
see
herself
as
she
hung
in
helene
vauquier
arms
with
her
delicate
frock
ludicrously
swathed
and
swaddled
about
her
legs
but
again
of
those
who
watched
her
no
one
smiled
we
have
had
no
such
tests
as
these
mme
dauvray
explained
half
in
fear
half
in
hope
adele
rossignol
looked
the
girl
over
and
nodded
her
head
with
satisfaction
she
had
no
animosity
towards
celia
she
had
really
no
feeling
of
any
kind
for
her
or
against
her
fortunately
she
was
unaware
at
this
time
that
harry
wethermill
had
been
paying
his
court
to
her
or
it
would
have
gone
worse
with
mlle
celie
before
the
night
was
out
mlle
celie
was
just
a
pawn
in
a
very
dangerous
game
which
she
happened
to
be
playing
and
she
had
succeeded
in
engineering
her
pawn
into
the
desired
condition
of
helplessness
she
was
content
mademoiselle
she
said
with
a
smile
you
wish
me
to
believe
you
have
now
your
opportunity
opportunity
and
she
was
helpless
she
knew
very
well
that
she
could
never
free
herself
from
these
cords
without
helene
help
she
would
fail
miserably
and
shamefully
fail
it
was
madame
who
wished
you
to
believe
she
stammered
and
adele
rossignol
laughed
suddenly
a
short
loud
harsh
laugh
which
jarred
upon
the
quiet
of
the
room
it
turned
celia
vague
alarm
into
a
definite
terror
some
magnetic
current
brought
her
grave
messages
of
fear
the
air
about
her
seemed
to
tingle
with
strange
menaces
she
looked
at
adele
did
they
emanate
from
her
and
her
terror
answered
her
yes
she
made
her
mistake
in
that
the
strong
personality
in
the
room
was
not
adele
rossignol
but
helene
vauquier
who
held
her
like
a
child
in
her
arms
but
she
was
definitely
aware
of
danger
and
too
late
aware
of
it
she
struggled
vainly
from
her
head
to
her
feet
she
was
powerless
she
cried
out
hysterically
to
her
patron
madame
madame
there
is
something
a
presence
here
some
one
who
means
harm
i
know
it
and
upon
the
old
woman
face
there
came
a
look
not
of
alarm
but
of
extraordinary
relief
the
genuine
heartfelt
cry
restored
her
confidence
in
celia
some
one
who
means
harm
she
whispered
trembling
with
excitement
ah
mademoiselle
is
already
under
control
said
helene
using
the
jargon
which
she
had
learnt
from
celia
lips
adele
rossignol
grinned
yes
la
petite
is
under
control
she
repeated
with
a
sneer
and
all
the
elegance
of
her
velvet
gown
was
unable
to
hide
her
any
longer
from
celia
knowledge
her
grin
had
betrayed
her
she
was
of
the
dregs
but
helene
vauquier
whispered
keep
still
mademoiselle
i
shall
help
you
vauquier
carried
the
girl
into
the
recess
and
placed
her
upon
the
stool
with
a
long
cord
adele
bound
her
by
the
arms
and
the
waist
to
the
pillar
and
her
ankles
she
fastened
to
the
rung
of
the
stool
so
that
they
could
not
touch
the
ground
thus
we
shall
be
sure
that
when
we
hear
rapping
it
will
be
the
spirits
and
not
the
heels
which
rap
she
said
yes
i
am
contented
now
and
she
added
with
a
smile
celie
may
even
have
her
scarf
and
picking
up
a
white
scarf
of
tulle
which
celia
had
brought
down
with
her
she
placed
it
carelessly
round
her
shoulders
wait
helene
vauquier
whispered
in
celia
ear
to
the
cord
about
celia
waist
adele
was
fastening
a
longer
line
i
shall
keep
my
foot
on
the
other
end
of
this
she
said
when
the
lights
are
out
and
i
shall
know
then
if
our
little
one
frees
herself
the
three
women
went
out
of
the
recess
and
the
next
moment
the
heavy
silk
curtains
swung
across
the
opening
leaving
celia
in
darkness
quickly
and
noiselessly
the
poor
girl
began
to
twist
and
work
her
hands
but
she
only
bruised
her
wrists
this
was
to
be
the
last
of
the
seances
but
it
must
succeed
so
much
of
mme
dauvray
happiness
so
much
of
her
own
hung
upon
its
success
let
her
fail
she
would
be
surely
turned
from
the
door
the
story
of
her
trickery
and
her
exposure
would
run
through
aix
and
she
had
not
told
harry
it
would
reach
his
ears
from
others
he
would
never
forgive
her
to
face
the
old
difficult
life
of
poverty
and
perhaps
starvation
again
and
again
alone
would
be
hard
enough
but
to
face
it
with
harry
contempt
added
to
its
burdens
as
the
poor
girl
believed
she
surely
would
have
to
do
no
that
would
be
impossible
not
this
time
would
she
turn
away
from
the
seine
because
it
was
so
terrible
and
cold
if
she
had
had
the
courage
to
tell
him
yesterday
he
would
have
forgiven
surely
he
would
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
what
would
become
of
her
now
she
was
in
pain
besides
the
cords
about
her
arms
and
ankles
tortured
her
and
she
feared
yes
desperately
she
feared
the
effect
of
the
exposure
upon
mme
dauvray
she
had
been
treated
as
a
daughter
now
she
was
in
return
to
rob
mme
dauvray
of
the
belief
which
had
become
the
passion
of
her
life
let
us
take
our
seats
at
the
table
she
heard
mme
dauvray
say
helene
you
are
by
the
switch
of
the
electric
light
will
you
turn
it
off
and
upon
that
helene
whispered
yet
so
that
the
whisper
reached
to
celia
and
awakened
hope
wait
i
will
see
what
she
is
doing
the
curtains
opened
and
helene
vauquier
slipped
to
the
girl
side
celia
checked
her
tears
she
smiled
imploringly
gratefully
what
shall
i
do
asked
helene
in
a
voice
so
low
that
the
movement
of
her
mouth
rather
than
the
words
made
the
question
clear
celia
raised
her
head
to
answer
and
then
a
thing
incomprehensible
to
her
happened
as
she
opened
her
lips
helene
vauquier
swiftly
forced
a
handkerchief
in
between
the
girl
teeth
and
lifting
the
scarf
from
her
shoulders
wound
it
tightly
twice
across
her
mouth
binding
her
lips
and
made
it
fast
under
the
brim
of
her
hat
behind
her
head
celia
tried
to
scream
she
could
not
utter
a
sound
she
stared
at
helene
with
incredulous
eyes
helene
nodded
at
her
with
a
cruel
grin
of
satisfaction
and
celia
realised
though
she
did
not
understand
something
of
the
rancour
and
the
hatred
which
seethed
against
her
in
the
heart
of
the
woman
whom
she
had
supplanted
helene
vauquier
meant
to
expose
her
celia
had
not
a
doubt
of
it
that
was
her
explanation
of
helene
vauquier
treachery
and
believing
that
error
she
believed
yet
another
that
she
had
reached
the
terrible
climax
of
her
troubles
she
was
only
at
the
beginning
of
them
helene
cried
mme
dauvray
sharply
what
are
you
doing
the
maid
instantly
slid
back
into
the
room
mademoiselle
has
not
moved
she
said
celia
heard
the
women
settle
in
their
chairs
about
the
table
is
madame
ready
asked
helene
and
then
there
was
the
sound
of
the
snap
of
a
switch
in
the
salon
darkness
had
come
if
only
she
had
not
been
wearing
her
gloves
celia
thought
she
might
possibly
have
just
been
able
to
free
her
fingers
and
her
supple
hands
from
their
bonds
but
as
it
was
she
was
helpless
she
could
only
sit
and
wait
until
the
audience
in
the
salon
grew
tired
of
waiting
and
came
to
her
she
closed
her
eyes
pondering
if
by
any
chance
she
could
excuse
her
failure
but
her
heart
sank
within
her
as
she
thought
of
mme
rossignol
raillery
no
it
was
all
over
for
her
she
opened
her
eyes
and
she
wondered
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
more
light
in
the
recess
than
there
had
been
when
she
closed
them
very
likely
her
eyes
were
growing
used
to
the
darkness
yet
yet
she
ought
not
to
be
able
to
distinguish
quite
so
clearly
the
white
pillar
opposite
to
her
she
looked
towards
the
glass
doors
and
understood
the
wooden
shutters
outside
the
doors
were
not
quite
closed
they
had
been
carelessly
left
unbolted
a
chink
from
lintel
to
floor
let
in
a
grey
thread
of
light
celia
heard
the
women
whispering
in
the
salon
and
turned
her
head
to
catch
the
words
do
you
hear
any
sound
no
was
that
a
hand
which
touched
me
no
we
must
wait
and
so
silence
came
again
and
suddenly
there
was
quite
a
rush
of
light
into
the
recess
celia
was
startled
she
turned
her
head
back
again
towards
the
window
the
wooden
door
had
swung
a
little
more
open
there
was
a
wider
chink
to
let
the
twilight
of
that
starlit
darkness
through
and
as
she
looked
the
chink
slowly
broadened
and
broadened
the
door
swung
slowly
back
on
hinges
which
were
strangely
silent
celia
stared
at
the
widening
panel
of
grey
light
with
a
vague
terror
it
was
strange
that
she
could
hear
no
whisper
of
wind
in
the
garden
why
oh
why
was
that
latticed
door
opening
so
noiselessly
almost
she
believed
that
the
spirits
after
all
and
suddenly
the
recess
darkened
again
and
celia
sat
with
her
heart
leaping
and
shivering
in
her
breast
there
was
something
black
against
the
glass
doors
a
man
he
had
appeared
as
silently
as
suddenly
as
any
apparition
he
stood
blocking
out
the
light
pressing
his
face
against
the
glass
peering
into
the
room
for
a
moment
the
shock
of
horror
stunned
her
then
she
tore
frantically
at
the
cords
all
thought
of
failure
of
exposure
of
dismissal
had
fled
from
her
the
three
poor
women
that
was
her
thought
were
sitting
unwarned
unsuspecting
defenceless
in
the
of
the
salon
a
few
feet
away
a
man
a
thief
was
peering
in
they
were
waiting
for
strange
things
to
happen
in
the
darkness
strange
and
terrible
things
would
happen
unless
she
could
free
herself
unless
she
could
warn
them
and
she
could
not
her
struggles
were
mere
efforts
to
struggle
futile
a
shiver
from
head
to
foot
and
noiseless
as
a
shiver
adele
rossignol
had
done
her
work
well
and
thoroughly
arms
her
waist
her
ankles
were
pinioned
only
the
bandage
over
her
mouth
seemed
to
be
loosening
then
upon
horror
horror
was
added
the
man
touched
the
glass
doors
and
they
swung
silently
inwards
they
too
had
been
carelessly
left
unbolted
the
man
stepped
without
a
sound
over
the
sill
into
the
room
and
as
he
stepped
fear
for
herself
drove
out
for
the
moment
from
celia
thoughts
fear
for
the
three
women
in
the
black
room
if
only
he
did
not
see
her
she
pressed
herself
against
the
pillar
he
might
overlook
her
perhaps
his
eyes
would
not
be
so
accustomed
to
the
darkness
of
the
recess
as
hers
he
might
pass
her
unnoticed
if
only
he
did
not
touch
some
fold
of
her
dress
and
then
in
the
midst
of
her
terror
she
experienced
so
great
a
revulsion
from
despair
to
joy
that
a
faintness
came
upon
her
and
she
almost
swooned
she
saw
who
the
intruder
was
for
when
he
stepped
into
the
recess
he
turned
towards
her
and
the
dim
light
struck
upon
him
and
showed
her
the
contour
of
his
face
it
was
her
lover
harry
wethermill
why
he
had
come
at
this
hour
and
in
this
strange
way
she
did
not
consider
now
she
must
attract
his
eyes
now
her
fear
was
lest
he
should
not
see
her
but
he
came
at
once
straight
towards
her
he
stood
in
front
of
her
looking
into
her
eyes
but
he
uttered
no
cry
he
made
no
movement
of
surprise
celia
did
not
understand
it
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
now
and
she
could
not
see
it
of
course
he
was
stunned
amazed
but
but
he
stood
almost
as
if
he
had
expected
to
find
her
there
and
just
in
that
helpless
attitude
it
was
absurd
of
course
but
he
seemed
to
look
upon
her
helplessness
as
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
way
and
he
raised
no
hand
to
set
her
free
a
chill
struck
through
her
but
the
next
moment
he
did
raise
his
hand
and
the
blood
flowed
again
at
her
heart
of
course
she
was
in
the
darkness
he
had
not
seen
her
plight
even
now
he
was
only
beginning
to
be
aware
of
it
for
his
hand
touched
the
bandage
over
her
mouth
tentatively
he
felt
for
the
knot
under
the
broad
brim
of
her
hat
at
the
back
of
her
head
he
found
it
in
a
moment
she
would
be
free
she
kept
her
head
quite
still
and
then
why
was
he
so
long
she
asked
herself
oh
it
was
not
possible
but
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
and
she
knew
that
it
was
not
only
possible
it
was
true
he
was
tightening
the
scarf
not
loosening
it
the
folds
bound
her
lips
more
surely
she
felt
the
ends
drawn
close
at
the
back
of
her
head
in
a
frenzy
she
tried
to
shake
her
head
free
but
he
held
her
face
firmly
and
finished
his
work
he
was
wearing
gloves
she
noticed
with
horror
just
as
thieves
do
then
his
hands
slid
down
her
trembling
arms
and
tested
the
cord
about
her
wrists
there
was
something
horribly
deliberate
about
his
movements
celia
even
at
that
moment
even
with
him
had
the
sensation
which
had
possessed
her
in
the
salon
it
was
the
personal
equation
on
which
she
was
used
to
rely
but
neither
adele
nor
this
this
stranger
was
considering
her
as
even
a
human
being
she
was
a
pawn
in
their
game
and
they
used
her
careless
of
her
terror
her
beauty
her
pain
then
he
freed
from
her
waist
the
long
cord
which
ran
beneath
the
curtain
to
adele
rossignol
foot
celia
first
thought
was
one
of
relief
he
would
jerk
the
cord
unwittingly
they
would
come
into
the
recess
and
see
him
and
then
the
real
truth
flashed
in
upon
her
blindingly
he
had
jerked
the
cord
but
he
had
jerked
it
deliberately
he
was
already
winding
it
up
in
a
coil
as
it
slid
noiselessly
across
the
polished
floor
beneath
the
curtains
towards
him
he
had
given
a
signal
to
adele
rossignol
all
that
woman
scepticism
and
precaution
against
trickery
had
been
a
mere
blind
under
cover
of
which
she
had
been
able
to
pack
the
girl
away
securely
without
arousing
her
suspicions
helene
vauquier
was
in
the
plot
too
the
scarf
at
celia
mouth
was
proof
of
that
as
if
to
add
proof
to
proof
she
heard
adele
rossignol
speak
in
answer
to
the
signal
are
we
all
ready
have
you
got
mme
dauvray
left
hand
helene
yes
madame
answered
the
maid
and
i
have
her
right
hand
now
give
me
yours
and
thus
we
are
in
a
circle
about
the
table
celia
in
her
mind
could
see
them
sitting
about
the
round
table
in
the
darkness
mme
dauvray
between
the
two
women
securely
held
by
them
and
she
herself
could
not
utter
a
cry
could
not
move
a
muscle
to
help
her
wethermill
crept
back
on
noiseless
feet
to
the
window
closed
the
wooden
doors
and
slid
the
bolts
into
their
sockets
yes
helene
vauquier
was
in
the
plot
the
bolts
and
the
hinges
would
not
have
worked
so
smoothly
but
for
her
darkness
again
filled
the
recess
instead
of
the
grey
twilight
but
in
a
moment
a
faint
breath
of
wind
played
upon
celia
forehead
and
she
knew
that
the
man
had
parted
the
curtains
and
slipped
into
the
room
celia
let
her
head
fall
towards
her
shoulder
she
was
sick
and
faint
with
terror
her
lover
was
in
this
plot
the
lover
in
whom
she
had
felt
so
much
pride
for
whose
sake
she
had
taken
herself
so
bitterly
to
task
he
was
the
associate
of
adele
rossignol
of
helene
vauquier
he
had
used
her
celia
as
an
instrument
for
his
crime
all
their
hours
together
at
the
villa
des
fleurs
here
was
their
culmination
the
blood
buzzed
in
her
ears
and
hammered
in
the
veins
of
her
temples
in
front
of
her
eyes
the
darkness
whirled
flecked
with
fire
she
would
have
fallen
but
she
could
not
fall
then
in
the
silence
a
tambourine
jangled
there
was
to
be
a
seance
then
and
the
seance
had
begun
in
a
dreadful
suspense
she
heard
mme
dauvray
speak
chapter
xix
helene
explains
and
what
she
heard
made
her
blood
run
cold
mme
dauvray
spoke
in
a
hushed
awestruck
voice
there
is
a
presence
in
the
room
it
was
horrible
to
celia
that
the
poor
woman
was
speaking
the
jargon
which
she
herself
had
taught
to
her
i
will
speak
to
it
said
mme
dauvray
and
raising
her
voice
a
little
she
asked
who
are
you
that
come
to
us
from
the
no
answer
came
but
all
the
while
celia
knew
that
wethermill
was
stealing
noiselessly
across
the
floor
towards
that
voice
which
spoke
this
professional
patter
with
so
simple
a
solemnity
answer
she
said
and
the
next
moment
she
uttered
a
little
shrill
cry
a
cry
of
enthusiasm
fingers
touch
my
forehead
now
they
touch
my
cheek
now
they
touch
my
throat
and
upon
that
the
voice
ceased
but
a
dry
choking
sound
was
heard
and
a
horrible
scuffling
and
tapping
of
feet
upon
the
polished
floor
a
sound
most
dreadful
they
were
murdering
her
murdering
an
old
kind
woman
silently
and
methodically
in
the
darkness
the
girl
strained
and
twisted
against
the
pillar
furiously
like
an
animal
in
a
trap
but
the
coils
of
rope
held
her
the
scarf
suffocated
her
the
scuffling
became
a
spasmodic
sound
with
intervals
between
and
then
ceased
altogether
a
voice
spoke
a
man
voice
wethermill
but
celia
would
never
have
recognised
it
it
had
so
shrill
and
fearful
an
intonation
that
horrible
he
said
and
his
voice
suddenly
rose
to
a
scream
hush
helene
vauquier
whispered
sharply
what
the
matter
she
fell
against
me
her
whole
weight
oh
you
are
afraid
of
her
yes
yes
and
in
the
darkness
wethermill
voice
came
querulously
between
long
breaths
yes
now
i
am
afraid
of
her
helene
vauquier
replied
again
contemptuously
she
spoke
aloud
and
quite
indifferently
nothing
of
any
importance
whatever
one
would
have
gathered
had
occurred
i
will
turn
on
the
light
she
said
and
through
the
chinks
in
the
curtain
the
bright
light
shone
celia
heard
a
loud
rattle
upon
the
table
and
then
fainter
sounds
of
the
same
kind
and
as
a
kind
of
horrible
accompaniment
there
ran
the
laboured
breathing
of
the
man
which
broke
now
and
then
with
a
sobbing
sound
they
were
stripping
mme
dauvray
of
her
pearl
necklace
her
bracelets
and
her
rings
celia
had
a
sudden
importunate
vision
of
the
old
woman
fat
podgy
hands
loaded
with
brilliants
a
jingle
of
keys
followed
that
all
helene
vauquier
said
she
might
have
just
turned
out
the
pocket
of
an
old
dress
there
was
the
sound
of
something
heavy
and
inert
falling
with
a
dull
crash
upon
the
floor
a
woman
laughed
and
again
it
was
helene
vauquier
which
is
the
key
of
the
safe
asked
adele
and
helene
vauquier
replied
that
one
celia
heard
some
one
drop
heavily
into
a
chair
it
was
wethermill
and
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
helene
went
over
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
shook
him
do
you
go
and
get
her
jewels
out
of
the
safe
she
said
and
she
spoke
with
a
rough
friendliness
you
promised
you
would
blindfold
the
girl
he
cried
hoarsely
helene
vauquier
laughed
did
i
she
said
well
what
does
it
matter
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
and
his
voice
broke
off
shudderingly
would
there
and
what
of
us
adele
and
me
she
knows
certainly
that
we
are
here
come
go
and
get
the
jewels
the
key
of
the
door
on
the
mantelshelf
while
you
are
away
we
two
will
arrange
the
pretty
baby
in
there
she
pointed
to
the
recess
her
voice
rang
with
contempt
wethermill
staggered
across
the
room
like
a
drunkard
and
picked
up
the
key
in
trembling
fingers
celia
heard
it
turn
in
the
lock
and
the
door
bang
wethermill
had
gone
upstairs
celia
leaned
back
her
heart
fainting
within
her
arrange
it
was
her
turn
now
she
was
to
be
arranged
she
had
no
doubt
what
sinister
meaning
that
innocent
word
concealed
the
dry
choking
sound
the
horrid
scuffling
of
feet
upon
the
floor
were
in
her
ears
and
it
had
taken
so
long
so
terribly
long
she
heard
the
door
open
again
and
shut
again
then
steps
approached
the
recess
the
curtains
were
flung
back
and
the
two
women
stood
in
front
of
her
the
tall
adele
rossignol
with
her
red
hair
and
her
coarse
good
looks
and
her
sapphire
dress
and
the
sallow
maid
the
maid
was
carrying
celia
white
coat
they
did
not
mean
to
murder
her
then
they
meant
to
take
her
away
and
even
then
a
spark
of
hope
lit
up
in
the
girl
bosom
for
even
with
her
illusions
crushed
she
still
clung
to
life
with
all
the
passion
of
her
young
soul
the
two
women
stood
and
looked
at
her
and
then
adele
rossignol
burst
out
laughing
vauquier
approached
the
girl
and
celia
had
a
hope
that
she
meant
to
free
her
altogether
but
she
only
loosed
the
cords
which
fixed
her
to
the
pillar
and
the
high
stool
mademoiselle
will
pardon
me
for
laughing
said
adele
rossignol
politely
but
it
was
mademoiselle
who
invited
me
to
try
my
hand
and
really
for
so
smart
a
young
lady
mademoiselle
looks
too
ridiculous
she
lifted
the
girl
up
and
carried
her
back
writhing
and
struggling
into
the
salon
the
whole
of
the
pretty
room
was
within
view
but
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
something
lay
dreadfully
still
and
quiet
celia
held
her
head
averted
but
it
was
there
and
though
it
was
there
all
the
while
the
women
joked
and
laughed
adele
rossignol
feverishly
helene
vauquier
with
a
real
glee
most
horrible
to
see
i
beg
mademoiselle
not
to
listen
to
what
adele
is
saying
exclaimed
helene
and
she
began
to
ape
in
a
mincing
extravagant
fashion
the
manner
of
a
saleswoman
in
a
shop
mademoiselle
has
never
looked
so
ravishing
this
style
is
the
last
word
of
fashion
it
is
what
there
is
of
most
chic
of
course
mademoiselle
understands
that
the
costume
is
not
intended
for
playing
the
piano
nor
indeed
for
the
ballroom
it
leaps
to
one
eyes
that
dancing
would
be
difficult
nor
is
it
intended
for
much
conversation
it
is
a
costume
for
a
mood
of
quiet
reflection
but
i
assure
mademoiselle
that
for
pretty
young
ladies
who
are
the
favourites
of
rich
old
women
it
is
the
style
most
recommended
by
the
criminal
classes
all
the
woman
bitter
rancour
against
celia
hidden
for
months
beneath
a
mask
of
humility
burst
out
and
ran
riot
now
she
went
to
adele
rossignol
help
and
they
flung
the
girl
face
downwards
upon
the
sofa
her
face
struck
the
cushion
at
one
end
her
feet
the
cushion
at
the
other
the
breath
was
struck
out
of
her
body
she
lay
with
her
bosom
heaving
helene
vauquier
watched
her
for
a
moment
with
a
grin
paying
herself
now
for
her
respectful
speeches
and
attendance
yes
lie
quietly
and
reflect
little
fool
she
said
savagely
were
you
wise
to
come
here
and
interfere
with
helene
vauquier
had
you
better
have
stayed
and
danced
in
your
rags
at
montmartre
are
the
smart
frocks
and
the
pretty
hats
and
the
good
dinners
worth
the
price
ask
yourself
these
questions
my
dainty
little
friend
she
drew
up
a
chair
to
celia
side
and
sat
down
upon
it
comfortably
i
will
tell
you
what
we
are
going
to
do
with
you
mlle
celie
adele
rossignol
and
that
kind
gentleman
wethermill
are
going
to
take
you
away
with
them
you
will
be
glad
to
go
wo
you
dearie
for
you
love
wethermill
do
you
oh
they
wo
keep
you
long
enough
for
you
to
get
tired
of
them
do
not
fear
but
you
will
not
come
back
mile
celie
no
you
have
seen
too
much
and
every
one
will
think
that
mlle
celie
helped
to
murder
and
rob
her
benefactress
they
are
certain
to
suspect
some
one
so
why
not
you
pretty
one
celia
made
no
movement
she
lay
trying
to
believe
that
no
crime
had
been
committed
that
that
lifeless
body
did
not
lie
against
the
wall
and
then
she
heard
in
the
room
above
a
bed
wheeled
roughly
from
its
place
the
two
women
heard
it
too
and
looked
at
one
another
he
should
look
in
the
safe
said
vauquier
go
and
see
what
he
is
doing
and
adele
rossignol
ran
from
the
room
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
vauquier
followed
to
the
door
listened
closed
it
gently
and
came
back
she
stooped
down
mlle
celie
she
said
in
a
smooth
silky
voice
which
terrified
the
girl
more
than
her
harsh
tones
there
is
just
one
little
thing
wrong
in
your
appearance
one
tiny
little
piece
of
bad
taste
if
mademoiselle
will
pardon
a
poor
servant
the
expression
i
did
not
mention
it
before
adele
rossignol
she
is
so
severe
in
her
criticism
is
she
not
but
since
we
are
alone
i
will
presume
to
point
out
to
mademoiselle
that
those
diamond
eardrops
which
i
see
peeping
out
under
the
scarf
are
a
little
ostentatious
in
her
present
predicament
they
are
a
provocation
to
thieves
will
mademoiselle
permit
me
to
remove
them
she
caught
her
by
the
neck
and
lifted
her
up
she
pushed
the
lace
scarf
up
at
the
side
of
celia
head
celia
began
to
struggle
furiously
convulsively
she
kicked
and
writhed
and
a
little
tearing
sound
was
heard
one
of
her
had
caught
in
the
thin
silk
covering
of
the
cushion
and
slit
it
helene
vauquier
let
her
fall
she
felt
composedly
in
her
pocket
and
drew
from
it
an
aluminium
flask
the
same
flask
which
lemerre
was
afterward
to
snatch
up
in
the
bedroom
in
geneva
celia
stared
at
her
in
dread
she
saw
the
flask
flashing
in
the
light
she
shrank
from
it
she
wondered
what
new
horror
was
to
grip
her
helene
unscrewed
the
top
and
laughed
pleasantly
mlle
celie
is
under
control
she
said
we
shall
have
to
teach
her
that
it
is
not
polite
in
young
ladies
to
kick
she
pressed
celia
down
with
a
hand
upon
her
back
and
her
voice
changed
lie
still
she
commanded
savagely
do
you
hear
do
you
know
what
this
is
mlle
celie
and
she
held
the
flask
towards
the
girl
face
this
is
vitriol
my
pretty
one
move
and
i
spoil
these
smooth
white
shoulders
for
you
how
would
you
like
that
celia
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
and
burying
her
face
in
the
cushion
lay
trembling
she
would
have
begged
for
death
upon
her
knees
rather
than
suffer
this
horror
she
felt
vauquier
fingers
lingering
with
a
dreadful
caressing
touch
upon
her
shoulders
and
about
her
throat
she
was
within
an
ace
of
the
torture
the
disfigurement
and
she
knew
it
she
could
not
pray
for
mercy
she
could
only
lie
quite
still
as
she
was
bidden
trying
to
control
the
shuddering
of
her
limbs
and
body
it
would
be
a
good
lesson
for
mlle
celie
helene
continued
slowly
i
think
that
if
mlle
celie
will
forgive
the
liberty
i
ought
to
inflict
it
one
little
tilt
of
the
flask
and
the
satin
of
these
pretty
shoulders
she
broke
off
suddenly
and
listened
some
sound
heard
outside
had
given
celia
a
respite
perhaps
more
than
a
respite
helene
set
the
flask
down
upon
the
table
her
avarice
had
got
the
better
of
her
hatred
she
roughly
plucked
the
earrings
out
of
the
girl
ears
she
hid
them
quickly
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
with
her
eye
upon
the
door
she
did
not
see
a
drop
of
blood
gather
on
the
lobe
of
celia
ear
and
fall
into
the
cushion
on
which
her
face
was
pressed
she
had
hardly
hidden
them
away
before
the
door
opened
and
adele
rossignol
burst
into
the
room
what
is
the
matter
asked
vauquier
the
safe
empty
we
have
searched
the
room
we
have
found
nothing
she
cried
everything
is
in
the
safe
helene
insisted
no
the
two
women
ran
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
celia
lying
on
the
settee
heard
all
the
quiet
of
the
house
change
to
noise
and
confusion
it
was
as
though
a
tornado
raged
in
the
room
overhead
furniture
was
tossed
about
and
over
the
room
feet
stamped
and
ran
locks
were
smashed
in
with
heavy
blows
for
many
minutes
the
storm
raged
then
it
ceased
and
she
heard
the
accomplices
clattering
down
the
stairs
without
a
thought
of
the
noise
they
made
they
burst
into
the
room
harry
wethermill
was
laughing
hysterically
like
a
man
off
his
head
he
had
been
wearing
a
long
dark
overcoat
when
he
entered
the
house
now
he
carried
the
coat
over
his
arm
he
was
in
a
and
his
black
clothes
were
dusty
and
disordered
it
all
for
nothing
he
screamed
rather
than
cried
nothing
but
the
one
necklace
and
a
handful
of
rings
in
a
frenzy
he
actually
stooped
over
the
dead
woman
and
questioned
her
tell
us
where
did
you
hide
them
he
cried
the
girl
will
know
said
helene
wethermill
rose
up
and
looked
wildly
at
celia
yes
yes
he
said
he
had
no
scruple
no
pity
any
longer
for
the
girl
there
was
no
gain
from
the
crime
unless
she
spoke
he
would
have
placed
his
head
in
the
guillotine
for
nothing
he
ran
to
the
tore
off
half
a
sheet
of
paper
and
brought
it
over
with
a
pencil
to
the
sofa
he
gave
them
to
vauquier
to
hold
and
drawing
out
the
sofa
from
the
wall
slipped
in
behind
he
lifted
up
celia
with
rossignol
help
and
made
her
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
sofa
with
her
feet
upon
the
ground
he
unbound
her
wrists
and
fingers
and
vauquier
placed
the
and
the
paper
on
the
girl
knees
her
arms
were
still
pinioned
above
the
elbows
she
could
not
raise
her
hands
high
enough
to
snatch
the
scarf
from
her
lips
but
with
the
pad
held
up
to
her
she
could
write
where
did
she
keep
her
jewels
quick
take
the
pencil
and
write
said
wethermill
holding
her
left
wrist
vauquier
thrust
the
pencil
into
her
right
hand
and
awkwardly
and
slowly
her
gloved
fingers
moved
across
the
page
i
do
not
know
she
wrote
and
with
an
oath
wethermill
snatched
the
paper
up
tore
it
into
pieces
and
threw
it
down
you
have
got
to
know
he
said
his
face
purple
with
passion
and
he
flung
out
his
arm
as
though
he
would
dash
his
fist
into
her
face
but
as
he
stood
with
his
arm
poised
there
came
a
singular
change
upon
his
face
did
you
hear
anything
he
asked
in
a
whisper
all
listened
and
all
heard
in
the
quiet
of
the
night
a
faint
click
and
after
an
interval
they
heard
it
again
and
after
another
but
shorter
interval
yet
once
more
that
the
gate
said
wethermill
in
a
whisper
of
fear
and
a
pulse
of
hope
stirred
within
celia
he
seized
her
wrists
crushed
them
together
behind
her
and
swiftly
fastened
them
once
more
adele
rossignol
sat
down
upon
the
floor
took
the
girl
feet
upon
her
lap
and
quietly
wrenched
off
her
shoes
the
light
cried
wethermill
in
an
agonised
voice
and
helena
vauquier
flew
across
the
room
and
turned
it
off
all
three
stood
holding
their
breath
straining
their
ears
in
the
dark
room
on
the
hard
gravel
of
the
drive
outside
footsteps
became
faintly
audible
and
grew
louder
and
came
near
adele
whispered
to
vauquier
has
the
girl
a
lover
and
helene
vauquier
even
at
that
moment
laughed
quietly
all
celia
heart
and
youth
rose
in
revolt
against
her
extremity
if
she
could
only
free
her
lips
the
footsteps
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
they
sounded
on
the
drive
outside
the
very
window
of
this
room
one
cry
and
she
would
be
saved
she
tossed
back
her
head
and
tried
to
force
the
handkerchief
out
from
between
her
teeth
but
wethermill
hand
covered
her
mouth
and
held
it
closed
the
footsteps
stopped
a
light
shone
for
a
moment
outside
the
very
handle
of
the
door
was
tried
within
a
few
yards
help
was
there
help
and
life
just
a
frail
latticed
wooden
door
stood
between
her
and
them
she
tried
to
rise
to
her
feet
adele
rossignol
held
her
legs
firmly
she
was
powerless
she
sat
with
one
desperate
hope
that
whoever
it
was
who
was
in
the
garden
he
would
break
in
were
it
even
another
murderer
he
might
have
more
pity
than
the
callous
brutes
who
held
her
now
he
could
have
no
less
but
the
footsteps
moved
away
it
was
the
withdrawal
of
all
hope
celia
heard
wethermill
behind
her
draw
a
long
breath
of
relief
that
seemed
to
celia
almost
the
cruellest
part
of
the
whole
tragedy
they
waited
in
the
darkness
until
the
faint
click
of
the
gate
was
heard
once
more
then
the
light
was
turned
up
again
we
must
go
said
wethermill
all
the
three
of
them
were
shaken
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
white
and
trembling
they
spoke
in
whispers
to
get
out
of
the
room
to
have
done
with
the
business
that
had
suddenly
become
their
chief
necessity
adele
picked
up
the
necklace
and
the
rings
from
the
table
and
put
them
into
a
which
was
slung
at
her
waist
hippolyte
shall
turn
these
things
into
money
she
said
he
shall
set
about
it
we
shall
have
to
keep
the
girl
now
until
she
tells
us
where
the
rest
is
hidden
yes
keep
her
said
helene
we
will
come
over
to
geneva
in
a
few
days
as
soon
as
we
can
we
will
persuade
her
to
tell
she
glanced
darkly
at
the
girl
celia
shivered
yes
that
it
said
wethermill
but
do
harm
her
she
will
tell
of
her
own
will
you
will
see
the
delay
wo
hurt
now
we
ca
come
back
and
search
for
a
little
while
he
was
speaking
in
a
quick
agitated
voice
and
adele
agreed
the
desire
to
be
gone
had
killed
even
their
fury
at
the
loss
of
their
prize
some
time
they
would
come
back
but
they
would
not
search
now
they
were
too
unnerved
helene
said
wethermill
get
to
bed
i
come
up
with
the
chloroform
and
put
you
to
sleep
helene
vauquier
hurried
upstairs
it
was
part
of
her
plan
that
she
should
be
left
alone
in
the
villa
chloroformed
thus
only
could
suspicion
be
averted
from
herself
she
did
not
shrink
from
the
completion
of
the
plan
now
she
went
the
strange
woman
without
a
tremor
to
her
ordeal
wethermill
took
the
length
of
rope
which
had
fixed
celia
to
the
pillar
i
follow
he
said
and
as
he
turned
he
stumbled
over
the
body
of
mme
dauvray
with
a
shrill
cry
he
kicked
it
out
of
his
way
and
crept
up
the
stairs
adele
rossignol
quickly
set
the
room
in
order
she
removed
the
stool
from
its
position
in
the
recess
and
carried
it
to
its
place
in
the
hall
she
put
celia
shoes
upon
her
feet
loosening
the
cord
from
her
ankles
then
she
looked
about
the
floor
and
picked
up
here
and
there
a
scrap
of
cord
in
the
silence
the
clock
upon
the
mantelshelf
chimed
the
quarter
past
eleven
she
screwed
the
stopper
on
the
flask
of
vitriol
very
carefully
and
put
the
flask
away
in
her
pocket
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
fetched
the
key
of
the
garage
she
put
her
hat
on
her
head
she
even
picked
up
and
drew
on
her
gloves
afraid
lest
she
should
leave
them
behind
and
then
wethermill
came
down
again
adele
looked
at
him
inquiringly
it
is
all
done
he
said
with
a
nod
of
the
head
i
will
bring
the
car
down
to
the
door
then
i
drive
you
to
geneva
and
come
back
with
the
car
here
he
cautiously
opened
the
latticed
door
of
the
window
listened
for
a
moment
and
ran
silently
down
the
drive
adele
closed
the
door
again
but
she
did
not
bolt
it
she
came
back
into
the
room
she
looked
at
celia
as
she
lay
back
upon
the
settee
with
a
long
glance
of
indecision
and
then
to
celia
surprise
for
she
had
given
up
all
hope
the
indecision
in
her
eyes
became
pity
she
suddenly
ran
across
the
room
and
knelt
down
before
celia
with
quick
and
feverish
hands
she
untied
the
cord
which
fastened
the
train
of
her
skirt
about
her
knees
at
first
celia
shrank
away
fearing
some
new
cruelty
but
adele
voice
came
to
her
ears
speaking
and
speaking
with
remorse
i
ca
endure
it
she
whispered
you
are
so
young
too
young
to
be
killed
the
tears
were
rolling
down
celia
cheeks
her
face
was
pitiful
and
beseeching
do
look
at
me
like
that
for
god
sake
child
adele
went
on
and
she
chafed
the
girl
ankles
for
a
moment
can
you
stand
she
asked
celia
nodded
her
head
gratefully
after
all
then
she
was
not
to
die
it
seemed
to
her
hardly
possible
but
before
she
could
rise
a
subdued
whirr
of
machinery
penetrated
into
the
room
and
the
came
slowly
to
the
front
of
the
villa
keep
still
said
adele
hurriedly
and
she
placed
herself
in
front
of
celia
wethermill
opened
the
wooden
door
while
celia
heart
raced
in
her
bosom
i
will
go
down
and
open
the
gate
he
whispered
are
you
ready
yes
wethermill
disappeared
and
this
time
he
left
the
door
open
adele
helped
celia
to
her
feet
for
a
moment
she
tottered
then
she
stood
firm
now
run
whispered
adele
run
child
for
your
life
celia
did
not
stop
to
think
whither
she
should
run
or
how
she
should
escape
from
wethermill
search
she
could
not
ask
that
her
lips
and
her
hands
might
be
freed
she
had
but
a
few
seconds
she
had
one
thought
to
hide
herself
in
the
darkness
of
the
garden
celia
fled
across
the
room
sprang
wildly
over
the
sill
ran
tripped
over
her
skirt
steadied
herself
and
was
swung
off
the
ground
by
the
arms
of
harry
wethermill
there
we
are
he
said
with
his
shrill
wavering
laugh
i
opened
the
gate
before
and
suddenly
celia
hung
inert
in
his
arms
the
light
went
out
in
the
salon
adele
rossignol
carrying
cloak
stepped
out
at
the
side
of
the
window
she
has
fainted
said
wethermill
wipe
the
mould
off
her
shoes
and
off
yours
too
carefully
i
do
want
them
to
think
this
car
has
been
out
of
the
garage
at
all
adele
stooped
and
obeyed
wethermill
opened
the
door
of
the
car
and
flung
celia
into
a
seat
adele
followed
and
took
her
seat
opposite
the
girl
wethermill
stepped
carefully
again
on
to
the
grass
and
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
scraped
up
and
ploughed
the
impressions
which
he
and
adele
rossignol
had
made
on
the
ground
leaving
those
which
celia
had
made
he
came
back
to
the
window
she
has
left
her
footmarks
clear
enough
he
whispered
there
will
be
no
doubt
in
the
morning
that
she
went
of
her
own
free
will
then
he
took
the
chauffeur
seat
and
the
car
glided
silently
down
the
drive
and
out
by
the
gate
as
soon
as
it
was
on
the
road
it
stopped
in
an
instant
adele
rossignol
head
was
out
of
the
window
what
is
it
she
exclaimed
in
fear
wethermill
pointed
to
the
roof
he
had
left
the
light
burning
in
helene
vauquier
room
we
ca
go
back
now
said
adele
in
a
frantic
whisper
no
it
is
over
i
dare
go
back
and
wethermill
jammed
down
the
lever
the
car
sprang
forward
and
humming
steadily
over
the
white
road
devoured
the
miles
but
they
had
made
their
one
mistake
chapter
xx
the
geneva
road
the
car
had
nearly
reached
annecy
before
celia
woke
to
consciousness
and
even
then
she
was
dazed
she
was
only
aware
that
she
was
in
the
and
travelling
at
a
great
speed
she
lay
back
drinking
in
the
fresh
air
then
she
moved
and
with
the
movement
came
to
her
recollection
and
the
sense
of
pain
her
arms
and
wrists
were
still
bound
behind
her
and
the
cords
hurt
her
like
hot
wires
her
mouth
however
and
her
feet
were
free
she
started
forward
and
adele
rossignol
spoke
sternly
from
the
seat
opposite
keep
still
i
am
holding
the
flask
in
my
hand
if
you
scream
if
you
make
a
movement
to
escape
i
shall
fling
the
vitriol
in
your
face
she
said
celia
shrank
back
shivering
i
wo
i
wo
she
whispered
piteously
her
spirit
was
broken
by
the
horrors
of
the
night
adventure
she
lay
back
and
cried
quietly
in
the
darkness
of
the
carriage
the
car
dashed
through
annecy
it
seemed
incredible
to
celia
that
less
than
six
hours
ago
she
had
been
dining
with
mme
dauvray
and
the
woman
opposite
who
was
now
her
jailer
mme
dauvray
lay
dead
in
the
little
salon
and
she
herself
she
dared
not
think
what
lay
in
front
of
her
she
was
to
be
persuaded
that
was
the
word
to
tell
what
she
did
not
know
meanwhile
her
name
would
be
execrated
through
aix
as
the
murderess
of
the
woman
who
had
saved
her
then
suddenly
the
car
stopped
there
were
lights
outside
celia
heard
voices
a
man
was
speaking
to
wethermill
she
started
and
saw
adele
tace
arm
flash
upwards
she
sank
back
in
terror
and
the
car
rolled
on
into
the
darkness
adele
tace
drew
a
breath
of
relief
the
one
point
of
danger
had
been
passed
they
had
crossed
the
pont
de
la
caille
they
were
in
switzerland
some
long
while
afterwards
the
car
slackened
its
speed
by
the
side
of
it
celia
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
of
the
hooves
of
a
horse
a
closed
landau
had
been
caught
up
as
it
jogged
along
the
road
the
stopped
close
by
the
side
of
it
the
driver
of
the
landau
reined
in
his
horse
wethermill
jumped
down
from
the
seat
opened
the
door
of
the
landau
and
then
put
his
head
in
at
the
window
of
the
car
are
you
ready
be
quick
adele
turned
to
celia
not
a
word
remember
wethermill
flung
open
the
door
of
the
car
adele
took
the
girl
feet
and
drew
them
down
to
the
step
of
the
car
then
she
pushed
her
out
wethermill
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
landau
celia
dared
not
cry
out
her
hands
were
helpless
her
face
at
the
mercy
of
that
grim
flask
just
ahead
of
them
the
lights
of
geneva
were
visible
and
from
the
lights
a
silver
radiance
overspread
a
patch
of
sky
wethermill
placed
her
in
the
landau
adele
sprang
in
behind
her
and
closed
the
door
the
transfer
had
taken
no
more
than
a
few
seconds
the
landau
jogged
into
geneva
the
motor
turned
and
sped
back
over
the
fifty
miles
of
empty
road
to
aix
as
the
rolled
away
courage
returned
for
a
moment
to
celia
the
man
the
murderer
had
gone
she
was
alone
with
adele
rossignol
in
a
carriage
moving
no
faster
than
an
ordinary
trot
her
ankles
were
free
the
gag
had
been
taken
from
her
lips
if
only
she
could
free
her
hands
and
choose
a
moment
when
adele
was
off
her
guard
she
might
open
the
door
and
spring
out
on
to
the
road
she
saw
adele
draw
down
the
blinds
of
the
carriage
and
very
carefully
very
secretly
celia
began
to
work
her
hands
behind
her
she
was
an
adept
no
movement
was
visible
but
on
the
other
hand
no
success
was
obtained
the
knots
had
been
too
cunningly
tied
and
then
mme
rossignol
touched
a
button
at
her
side
in
the
leather
of
the
carriage
the
touch
turned
on
a
tiny
lamp
in
the
roof
of
the
carriage
and
she
raised
a
warning
hand
to
celia
now
keep
very
quiet
right
through
the
empty
streets
of
geneva
the
landau
was
quietly
driven
adele
had
peeped
from
time
to
time
under
the
blind
there
were
few
people
in
the
streets
once
or
twice
a
was
seen
under
the
light
of
a
lamp
celia
dared
not
cry
out
over
against
her
persistently
watching
her
adele
rossignol
sat
with
the
open
flask
clenched
in
her
hand
and
from
the
vitriol
celia
shrank
with
an
overwhelming
terror
the
carriage
drove
out
from
the
town
along
the
western
edge
of
the
lake
now
listen
said
adele
as
soon
as
the
landau
stops
the
door
of
the
house
opposite
to
which
it
stops
will
open
i
shall
open
the
carriage
door
myself
and
you
will
get
out
you
must
stand
close
by
the
carriage
door
until
i
have
got
out
i
shall
hold
this
flask
ready
in
my
hand
as
soon
as
i
am
out
you
will
run
across
the
pavement
into
the
house
you
wo
speak
or
scream
adele
rossignol
turned
out
the
lamp
and
ten
minutes
later
the
carriage
passed
down
the
little
street
and
attracted
mme
gobin
notice
marthe
gobin
had
lit
no
light
in
her
room
adele
rossignol
peered
out
of
the
carriage
she
saw
the
houses
in
darkness
she
could
not
see
the
busybody
face
watching
the
landau
from
a
dark
window
she
cut
the
cords
which
fastened
the
girl
hands
the
carriage
stopped
she
opened
the
door
celia
sprang
out
on
to
the
pavement
she
sprang
so
quickly
that
adele
rossignol
caught
and
held
the
train
of
her
dress
but
it
was
the
fear
of
the
vitriol
which
had
made
her
spring
so
nimbly
it
was
that
too
which
made
her
run
so
lightly
and
quickly
into
the
house
the
old
woman
who
acted
as
servant
jeanne
tace
received
her
celia
offered
no
resistance
the
fear
of
vitriol
had
made
her
supple
as
a
glove
jeanne
hurried
her
down
the
stairs
into
the
little
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
supper
was
laid
and
pushed
her
into
a
chair
celia
let
her
arms
fall
forward
on
the
table
she
had
no
hope
now
she
was
friendless
and
alone
in
a
den
of
murderers
who
meant
first
to
torture
then
to
kill
her
she
would
be
held
up
to
execration
as
a
murderess
no
one
would
know
how
she
had
died
or
what
she
had
suffered
she
was
in
pain
and
her
throat
burned
she
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
and
sobbed
all
her
body
shook
with
her
sobbing
jeanne
rossignol
took
no
notice
she
treated
celie
just
as
the
others
had
done
celia
was
la
petite
against
whom
she
had
no
animosity
by
whom
she
was
not
to
be
touched
to
any
tenderness
la
petite
had
unconsciously
played
her
useful
part
in
their
crime
but
her
use
was
ended
now
and
they
would
deal
with
her
accordingly
she
removed
the
girl
hat
and
cloak
and
tossed
them
aside
now
stay
quiet
until
we
are
ready
for
you
she
said
and
celia
lifting
her
head
said
in
a
whisper
water
the
old
woman
poured
some
from
a
jug
and
held
the
glass
to
celia
lips
thank
you
whispered
celia
gratefully
and
adele
came
into
the
room
she
told
the
story
of
the
night
to
jeanne
and
afterwards
to
hippolyte
when
he
joined
them
and
nothing
gained
cried
the
older
woman
furiously
and
we
have
hardly
a
piece
in
the
house
yes
something
said
adele
a
necklace
a
good
one
some
good
rings
and
bracelets
and
we
shall
find
out
where
the
rest
is
hid
from
her
and
she
nodded
at
celia
the
three
people
ate
their
supper
and
while
they
ate
it
discussed
celia
fate
she
was
lying
with
her
head
bowed
upon
her
arms
at
the
same
table
within
a
foot
of
them
but
they
made
no
more
of
her
presence
than
if
she
had
been
an
old
shoe
only
once
did
one
of
them
speak
to
her
stop
your
whimpering
said
hippolyte
roughly
we
can
hardly
hear
ourselves
talk
he
was
for
finishing
with
the
business
altogether
it
a
mistake
he
said
there
been
a
bungle
and
the
sooner
we
are
rid
of
it
the
better
there
a
boat
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
celia
listened
and
shuddered
he
would
have
no
more
compunction
over
drowning
her
than
he
would
have
had
over
drowning
a
blind
kitten
it
cursed
luck
he
said
but
we
have
got
the
necklace
something
that
our
share
do
you
see
the
young
spark
can
look
for
the
rest
but
helene
vauquier
wish
prevailed
she
was
the
leader
they
would
keep
the
girl
until
she
came
to
geneva
they
took
her
upstairs
into
the
big
bedroom
overlooking
the
lake
adele
opened
the
door
of
the
closet
where
a
stood
and
thrust
the
girl
in
this
is
my
room
she
said
warningly
pointing
to
the
bedroom
take
care
i
hear
no
noise
you
might
shout
yourself
hoarse
my
pretty
one
no
one
else
would
hear
you
but
i
should
and
afterwards
we
should
no
longer
be
able
to
call
you
pretty
one
eh
and
with
a
horrible
playfulness
she
pinched
the
girl
cheek
then
with
old
jeanne
help
she
stripped
celia
and
told
her
to
get
into
bed
i
give
her
something
to
keep
her
quiet
said
adele
and
she
fetched
her
and
injected
a
dose
into
celia
arm
then
they
took
her
clothes
away
and
left
her
in
the
darkness
she
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
a
moment
after
the
sound
of
the
bedstead
being
drawn
across
the
doorway
but
she
heard
no
more
for
almost
immediately
she
fell
asleep
she
was
awakened
some
time
the
next
day
by
the
door
opening
old
jeanne
tace
brought
her
in
a
jug
of
water
and
a
roll
of
bread
and
locked
her
up
again
and
a
long
time
afterwards
she
brought
her
another
supply
yet
another
day
had
gone
but
in
that
dark
cupboard
celia
had
no
means
of
judging
time
in
the
afternoon
the
newspaper
came
out
with
the
announcement
that
mme
dauvray
jewellery
had
been
discovered
under
the
boards
hippolyte
brought
in
the
newspaper
and
cursing
their
stupidity
they
sat
down
to
decide
upon
celia
fate
that
however
was
soon
arranged
they
would
dress
her
in
everything
which
she
wore
when
she
came
so
that
no
trace
of
her
might
be
discovered
they
would
give
her
another
dose
of
morphia
sew
her
up
in
a
sack
as
soon
as
she
was
unconscious
row
her
far
out
on
to
the
lake
and
sink
her
with
a
weight
attached
they
dragged
her
out
from
the
cupboard
always
with
the
threat
of
that
bright
aluminium
flask
before
her
eyes
she
fell
upon
her
knees
imploring
their
pity
with
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
but
they
sewed
the
strip
of
sacking
over
her
face
so
that
she
should
see
nothing
of
their
preparations
they
flung
her
on
the
sofa
secured
her
as
hanaud
had
found
her
and
leaving
her
in
the
old
woman
charge
sent
down
adele
for
her
needle
and
hippolyte
to
get
ready
the
boat
as
hippolyte
opened
the
door
he
saw
the
launch
of
the
chef
de
la
surete
glide
along
the
bank
chapter
xxi
hanaud
explains
this
is
the
story
as
ricardo
wrote
it
out
from
the
statement
of
celia
herself
and
the
confession
of
adele
rossignol
obscurities
which
had
puzzled
him
were
made
clear
but
he
was
still
unaware
how
hanaud
had
worked
out
the
solution
you
promised
me
that
you
would
explain
he
said
when
they
were
both
together
after
the
trial
was
over
at
aix
the
two
men
had
just
finished
luncheon
at
the
cercle
and
were
sitting
over
their
coffee
hanaud
lighted
a
cigar
there
were
difficulties
of
course
he
said
the
crime
was
so
carefully
planned
the
little
details
such
as
the
footprints
the
absence
of
any
mud
from
the
girl
shoes
in
the
carriage
of
the
the
dinner
at
annecy
the
purchase
of
the
cord
the
want
of
any
sign
of
a
struggle
in
the
little
salon
were
all
carefully
thought
out
had
not
one
little
accident
happened
and
one
little
mistake
been
made
in
consequence
i
doubt
if
we
should
have
laid
our
hands
upon
one
of
the
gang
we
might
have
suspected
wethermill
we
should
hardly
have
secured
him
and
we
should
very
likely
never
have
known
of
the
tace
family
that
mistake
was
as
you
no
doubt
are
fully
aware
the
failure
of
wethermill
to
discover
mme
dauvray
jewels
said
ricardo
at
once
no
my
friend
answered
hanaud
that
made
them
keep
mlle
celie
alive
it
enabled
us
to
save
her
when
we
had
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
the
gang
it
did
not
help
us
very
much
to
lay
our
hands
upon
them
no
the
little
accident
which
happened
was
the
entrance
of
our
friend
perrichet
into
the
garden
while
the
murderers
were
still
in
the
room
imagine
that
scene
ricardo
the
rage
of
the
murderers
at
their
inability
to
discover
the
plunder
for
which
they
had
risked
their
necks
the
old
woman
crumpled
up
on
the
floor
against
the
wall
the
girl
writing
laboriously
with
fettered
arms
do
not
know
under
threats
of
torture
and
then
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
the
clear
tiny
click
of
the
gate
and
the
measured
relentless
footsteps
no
wonder
they
were
terrified
in
that
dark
room
what
would
be
their
one
thought
why
to
get
away
to
come
back
perhaps
later
when
mlle
celie
should
have
told
them
what
by
the
way
she
did
not
know
but
in
any
case
to
get
away
now
so
they
made
their
little
mistake
and
in
their
hurry
they
left
the
light
burning
in
the
room
of
helene
vauquier
and
the
murder
was
discovered
seven
hours
too
soon
for
them
seven
hours
said
ricardo
yes
the
household
did
not
rise
early
it
was
not
until
seven
that
the
charwoman
came
it
was
she
who
was
meant
to
discover
the
crime
by
that
time
the
would
have
been
back
three
hours
ago
in
its
garage
servettaz
the
chauffeur
would
have
returned
from
chambery
some
time
in
the
morning
he
would
have
cleaned
the
car
he
would
have
noticed
that
there
was
very
little
petrol
in
the
tank
as
there
had
been
when
he
had
left
it
on
the
day
before
he
would
not
have
noticed
that
some
of
his
many
tins
which
had
been
full
yesterday
were
empty
we
should
not
have
discovered
that
about
four
in
the
morning
the
car
was
close
to
the
villa
rose
and
that
it
had
travelled
between
midnight
and
five
in
the
morning
a
hundred
and
fifty
kilometres
but
you
had
already
guessed
said
ricardo
at
luncheon
before
the
news
came
that
the
car
was
found
you
had
guessed
it
it
was
a
shot
said
hanaud
the
absence
of
the
car
helped
me
to
make
it
it
is
a
large
city
and
not
very
far
away
a
likely
place
for
people
with
the
police
at
their
heels
to
run
to
earth
in
but
if
the
car
had
been
discovered
in
the
garage
i
should
not
have
made
that
shot
even
then
i
had
no
particular
conviction
about
geneva
i
really
wished
to
see
how
wethermill
would
take
it
he
was
wonderful
he
sprang
up
he
betrayed
nothing
but
surprise
you
showed
no
less
surprise
than
he
did
my
good
friend
what
i
was
looking
for
was
one
glance
of
fear
i
did
not
get
it
yet
you
suspected
him
even
then
you
spoke
of
brains
and
audacity
you
told
him
enough
to
hinder
him
from
communicating
with
the
woman
in
geneva
you
isolated
him
yes
you
suspected
him
let
us
take
the
case
from
the
beginning
when
you
first
came
to
me
as
i
told
you
the
commissaire
had
already
been
with
me
there
was
an
interesting
piece
of
evidence
already
in
his
possession
adolphe
ruel
who
saw
wethermill
and
vauquier
together
close
by
the
casino
and
overheard
that
cry
of
wethermill
is
true
i
must
have
money
had
already
been
with
his
story
to
the
commissaire
i
knew
it
when
harry
wethermill
came
into
the
room
to
ask
me
to
take
up
the
case
that
was
a
bold
stroke
my
friend
the
chances
were
a
hundred
to
one
that
i
should
not
interrupt
my
holiday
to
take
up
a
case
because
of
your
little
in
london
indeed
i
should
not
have
interrupted
it
had
i
not
known
adolphe
ruel
story
as
it
was
i
could
not
resist
wethermill
very
audacity
charmed
me
oh
yes
i
felt
that
i
must
pit
myself
against
him
so
few
criminals
have
spirit
ricardo
it
is
deplorable
how
few
but
wethermill
see
in
what
a
fine
position
he
would
have
been
if
only
i
had
refused
he
himself
had
been
the
first
to
call
upon
the
first
detective
in
france
and
his
argument
he
loved
mlle
celie
therefore
she
must
be
innocent
how
he
stuck
to
it
people
would
have
said
is
blind
and
all
the
more
they
would
have
suspected
mile
celie
yes
but
they
love
the
blind
lover
therefore
all
the
more
would
it
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
believe
harry
wethermill
had
any
share
in
that
grim
crime
ricardo
drew
his
chair
closer
in
to
the
table
i
will
confess
to
you
he
said
that
i
thought
mlle
celie
was
an
accomplice
it
is
not
surprising
said
hanaud
some
one
within
the
house
was
an
accomplice
we
start
with
that
fact
the
house
had
not
been
broken
into
there
was
mlle
celie
record
as
helene
vauquier
gave
it
to
us
and
a
record
obviously
true
there
was
the
fact
that
she
had
got
rid
of
servettaz
there
was
the
maid
upstairs
very
ill
from
the
chloroform
what
more
likely
than
that
mlle
celie
had
arranged
a
seance
and
then
when
the
lights
were
out
had
admitted
the
murderer
through
that
convenient
glass
door
there
were
besides
the
definite
imprints
of
her
shoes
said
ricardo
yes
but
that
is
precisely
where
i
began
to
feel
sure
that
she
was
innocent
replied
hanaud
dryly
all
the
other
footmarks
had
been
so
carefully
scored
and
ploughed
up
that
nothing
could
be
made
of
them
yet
those
little
ones
remained
so
definite
so
easily
identified
and
i
began
to
wonder
why
these
too
had
not
been
cut
up
and
stamped
over
the
murderers
had
taken
you
see
an
excess
of
precaution
to
throw
the
presumption
of
guilt
upon
mlle
celie
rather
than
upon
vauquier
however
there
the
footsteps
were
mlle
celie
had
sprung
from
the
room
as
i
described
to
wethermill
but
i
was
puzzled
then
in
the
room
i
found
the
sheet
of
notepaper
with
the
words
ne
sais
pas
in
mademoiselle
handwriting
the
words
might
have
been
they
might
have
meant
anything
i
put
them
away
in
my
mind
but
in
the
room
the
settee
puzzled
me
and
again
i
was
troubled
greatly
troubled
yes
i
saw
that
and
not
you
alone
said
hanaud
with
a
smile
do
you
remember
that
loud
cry
wethermill
gave
when
we
returned
to
the
room
and
once
more
i
stood
before
the
settee
oh
he
turned
it
off
very
well
i
had
said
that
our
criminals
in
france
were
not
very
gentle
with
their
victims
and
he
pretended
that
it
was
in
fear
of
what
mlle
celie
might
be
suffering
which
had
torn
that
cry
from
his
heart
but
it
was
not
so
he
was
afraid
deadly
afraid
not
for
mlle
celie
but
for
himself
he
was
afraid
that
i
had
understood
what
these
cushions
had
to
tell
me
what
did
they
tell
you
asked
ricardo
you
know
now
said
hanaud
they
were
two
cushions
both
indented
and
indented
in
different
ways
the
one
at
the
head
was
irregularly
indented
something
shaped
had
pressed
upon
it
it
might
have
been
a
face
it
might
not
and
there
was
a
little
brown
stain
which
was
fresh
and
which
was
blood
the
second
cushion
had
two
separate
impressions
and
between
them
the
cushion
was
forced
up
in
a
thin
ridge
and
these
impressions
were
more
definite
i
measured
the
distance
between
the
two
cushions
and
i
found
this
that
supposing
and
it
was
a
large
supposition
the
cushions
had
not
been
moved
since
those
impressions
were
made
a
girl
of
mlle
celie
height
lying
stretched
out
upon
the
sofa
would
have
her
face
pressing
down
upon
one
cushion
and
her
feet
and
insteps
upon
the
other
now
the
impressions
upon
the
second
cushion
and
the
thin
ridge
between
them
were
just
the
impressions
which
might
have
been
made
by
a
pair
of
shoes
held
close
together
but
that
would
not
be
a
natural
attitude
for
any
one
and
the
mark
upon
the
head
cushion
was
very
deep
supposing
that
my
conjectures
were
true
then
a
woman
would
only
lie
like
that
because
she
was
helpless
because
she
had
been
flung
there
because
she
could
not
lift
herself
because
in
a
word
her
hands
were
tied
behind
her
back
and
her
feet
fastened
together
well
then
follow
this
train
of
reasoning
my
friend
suppose
my
conjectures
and
we
had
nothing
but
conjectures
to
build
upon
were
true
the
woman
flung
upon
the
sofa
could
not
be
helene
vauquier
for
she
would
have
said
so
she
could
have
had
no
reason
for
concealment
but
it
must
be
mlle
celie
there
was
the
slit
in
the
one
cushion
and
the
stain
on
the
other
which
of
course
i
had
not
accounted
for
there
was
still
too
the
puzzle
of
the
footsteps
outside
the
glass
doors
if
mlle
celie
had
been
bound
upon
the
sofa
how
came
she
to
run
with
her
limbs
free
from
the
house
there
was
a
question
a
question
not
easy
to
answer
yes
said
ricardo
yes
but
there
was
also
another
question
suppose
that
mlle
celie
was
after
all
the
victim
not
the
accomplice
suppose
she
had
been
flung
tied
upon
the
sofa
suppose
that
somehow
the
imprint
of
her
shoes
upon
the
ground
had
been
made
and
that
she
had
afterwards
been
carried
away
so
that
the
maid
might
be
cleared
of
all
complicity
in
that
case
it
became
intelligible
why
the
other
footprints
were
scored
out
and
hers
left
the
presumption
of
guilt
would
fall
upon
her
there
would
be
proof
that
she
ran
hurriedly
from
the
room
and
sprang
into
a
of
her
own
free
will
but
again
if
that
theory
were
true
then
helene
vauquier
was
the
accomplice
and
not
mlle
celie
i
follow
that
then
i
found
an
interesting
piece
of
evidence
with
regard
to
the
strange
woman
who
came
i
picked
up
a
long
red
hair
a
very
important
piece
of
evidence
about
which
i
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
at
all
it
was
not
mlle
celie
hair
which
is
fair
nor
vauquier
which
is
black
nor
mme
dauvray
which
is
dyed
brown
nor
the
charwoman
which
is
grey
it
was
therefore
the
visitor
well
we
went
upstairs
to
mile
celie
room
yes
said
ricardo
eagerly
we
are
coming
to
the
pot
of
cream
in
that
room
we
learnt
that
helene
vauquier
at
her
own
request
had
already
paid
it
a
visit
it
is
true
the
commissaire
said
that
he
had
kept
his
eye
on
her
the
whole
time
but
none
the
less
from
the
window
he
saw
me
coming
down
the
road
and
that
he
could
not
have
done
as
i
made
sure
unless
he
had
turned
his
back
upon
vauquier
and
leaned
out
of
the
window
now
at
the
time
i
had
an
open
mind
about
vauquier
on
the
whole
i
was
inclined
to
think
she
had
no
share
in
the
affair
but
either
she
or
mlle
celie
had
and
perhaps
both
but
one
of
them
yes
that
was
sure
therefore
i
asked
what
drawers
she
touched
after
the
commissaire
had
leaned
out
of
the
window
for
if
she
had
any
motive
in
wishing
to
visit
the
room
she
would
have
satisfied
it
when
the
commissaire
back
was
turned
he
pointed
to
a
drawer
and
i
took
out
a
dress
and
shook
it
thinking
that
she
may
have
wished
to
hide
something
but
nothing
fell
out
on
the
other
hand
however
i
saw
some
quite
fresh
made
by
fingers
and
the
marks
were
wet
i
began
to
ask
myself
how
it
was
that
helene
vauquier
who
had
just
been
helped
to
dress
by
the
nurse
had
grease
upon
her
fingers
then
i
looked
at
a
drawer
which
she
had
examined
first
of
all
there
were
no
on
the
clothes
she
had
turned
over
before
the
commissaire
leaned
out
of
the
window
therefore
it
followed
that
during
the
few
seconds
when
he
was
watching
me
she
had
touched
grease
i
looked
about
the
room
and
there
on
the
close
by
the
chest
of
drawers
was
a
pot
of
cold
cream
that
was
the
grease
helene
vauquier
had
touched
and
why
if
not
to
hide
some
small
thing
in
it
which
firstly
she
dared
not
keep
in
her
own
room
which
secondly
she
wished
to
hide
in
the
room
of
mlle
celie
and
which
thirdly
she
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
hide
before
now
bear
those
three
conditions
in
mind
and
tell
me
what
the
small
thing
was
ricardo
nodded
his
head
i
know
now
he
said
you
told
me
the
earrings
of
mlle
celie
but
i
should
not
have
guessed
it
at
the
time
nor
could
i
at
the
time
said
hanaud
i
kept
my
open
mind
about
helene
vauquier
but
i
locked
the
door
and
took
the
key
then
we
went
and
heard
vauquier
story
the
story
was
clever
because
so
much
of
it
was
obviously
indisputably
true
the
account
of
the
seances
of
mme
dauvray
superstitions
her
desire
for
an
interview
with
mme
de
montespan
such
details
are
not
invented
it
was
interesting
too
to
know
that
there
had
been
a
seance
planned
for
that
night
the
method
of
the
murder
began
to
be
clear
so
far
she
spoke
the
truth
but
then
she
lied
yes
she
lied
and
it
was
a
bad
lie
my
friend
she
told
us
that
the
strange
woman
adele
had
black
hair
now
i
carried
in
my
proof
that
that
woman
hair
was
red
why
did
she
lie
except
to
make
impossible
the
identification
of
that
strange
visitor
that
was
the
first
false
step
taken
by
helene
vauquier
now
let
us
take
the
second
i
thought
nothing
of
her
rancour
against
mlle
celie
to
me
it
was
all
very
natural
she
the
hard
peasant
woman
no
longer
young
who
had
been
for
years
the
confidential
servant
of
mme
dauvray
and
no
doubt
had
taken
her
levy
from
the
impostors
who
preyed
upon
her
credulous
mistress
certainly
she
would
hate
this
young
and
pretty
outcast
whom
she
has
to
wait
upon
whose
hair
she
has
to
dress
vauquier
she
would
hate
her
but
if
by
any
chance
she
were
in
the
plot
and
the
lie
seemed
to
show
she
was
then
the
seances
showed
me
new
possibilities
for
helene
used
to
help
mlle
celie
suppose
that
the
seance
had
taken
place
that
this
sceptical
visitor
with
the
red
hair
professed
herself
dissatisfied
with
vauquier
method
of
testing
the
medium
had
suggested
another
way
mlle
celie
could
not
object
and
there
she
would
be
neatly
and
securely
packed
up
beyond
the
power
of
offering
any
resistance
before
she
could
have
a
suspicion
that
things
were
wrong
it
would
be
an
easy
little
comedy
to
play
and
if
that
were
true
why
there
were
my
sofa
cushions
partly
explained
yes
i
see
cried
ricardo
with
enthusiasm
you
are
wonderful
hanaud
was
not
displeased
with
his
companion
enthusiasm
but
wait
a
moment
we
have
only
conjectures
so
far
and
one
fact
that
helene
vauquier
lied
about
the
colour
of
the
strange
woman
hair
now
we
get
another
fact
mlle
celie
was
wearing
buckles
on
her
shoes
and
there
is
my
slit
in
the
sofa
cushions
for
when
she
is
flung
on
to
the
sofa
what
will
she
do
she
will
kick
she
will
struggle
of
course
it
is
conjecture
i
do
not
as
yet
hold
pigheadedly
to
it
i
am
not
yet
sure
that
mlle
celie
is
innocent
i
am
willing
at
any
moment
to
admit
that
the
facts
contradict
my
theory
but
on
the
contrary
each
fact
that
i
discover
helps
it
to
take
shape
now
i
come
to
helene
vauquier
second
mistake
on
the
evening
when
you
saw
mlle
celie
in
the
garden
behind
the
you
noticed
that
she
wore
no
jewellery
except
a
pair
of
diamond
eardrops
in
the
photograph
of
her
which
wethermill
showed
me
again
she
was
wearing
them
is
it
not
therefore
probable
that
she
usually
wore
them
when
i
examined
her
room
i
found
the
case
for
those
earrings
the
case
was
empty
it
was
natural
then
to
infer
that
she
was
wearing
them
when
she
came
down
to
the
seance
yes
well
i
read
a
description
a
carefully
written
description
of
the
missing
girl
made
by
helene
vauquier
after
an
examination
of
the
girl
wardrobe
there
is
no
mention
of
the
earrings
so
i
asked
her
she
not
wearing
them
helene
vauquier
was
taken
by
surprise
how
should
i
know
anything
of
mlle
celie
earrings
she
hesitated
she
did
not
quite
know
what
answer
to
make
now
why
since
she
herself
dressed
mile
celie
and
remembers
so
very
well
all
she
wore
why
does
she
hesitate
well
there
is
a
reason
she
does
not
know
how
much
i
know
about
those
diamond
eardrops
she
is
not
sure
whether
we
have
not
dipped
into
that
pot
of
cold
cream
and
found
them
yet
without
knowing
she
can
not
answer
so
now
we
come
back
to
our
pot
of
cold
cream
yes
cried
ricardo
they
were
there
wait
a
bit
said
hanaud
let
us
see
how
it
works
out
remember
the
conditions
vauquier
has
some
small
thing
which
she
must
hide
and
which
she
wishes
to
hide
in
mlle
celie
room
for
she
admitted
that
it
was
her
suggestion
that
she
should
look
through
wardrobe
for
what
reason
does
she
choose
the
girl
room
except
that
if
the
thing
were
discovered
that
would
be
the
natural
place
for
it
it
is
then
something
belonging
to
mlle
celie
there
was
a
second
condition
we
laid
down
it
was
something
vauquier
had
not
been
able
to
hide
before
it
came
then
into
her
possession
last
night
why
could
she
not
hide
it
last
night
because
she
was
not
alone
there
were
the
man
and
the
woman
her
accomplices
it
was
something
then
which
she
was
concerned
in
hiding
from
them
it
is
not
rash
to
guess
then
that
it
was
some
piece
of
the
plunder
of
which
the
other
two
would
have
claimed
their
share
and
a
piece
of
plunder
belonging
to
mlle
celie
well
she
has
nothing
but
the
diamond
eardrops
suppose
vauquier
is
left
alone
to
guard
mlle
celie
while
the
other
two
ransack
mme
dauvray
room
she
sees
her
chance
the
girl
can
not
stir
hand
or
foot
to
save
herself
vauquier
tears
the
eardrops
in
a
hurry
from
her
ears
and
there
i
have
my
drop
of
blood
just
where
i
should
expect
it
to
be
but
now
follow
this
vauquier
hides
the
earrings
in
her
pocket
she
goes
to
bed
in
order
to
be
chloroformed
she
knows
that
it
is
very
possible
that
her
room
will
be
searched
before
she
regains
consciousness
or
before
she
is
well
enough
to
move
there
is
only
one
place
to
hide
them
in
only
one
place
where
they
will
be
safe
in
bed
with
her
but
in
the
morning
she
must
get
rid
of
them
and
a
nurse
is
with
her
hence
the
excuse
to
go
to
mlle
celie
room
if
the
eardrops
are
found
in
the
pot
of
cold
cream
it
would
only
be
thought
that
mlle
celie
had
herself
hidden
them
there
for
safety
again
it
is
conjecture
and
i
wish
to
make
sure
so
i
tell
vauquier
she
can
go
away
and
i
leave
her
unwatched
i
have
her
driven
to
the
depot
instead
of
to
her
friends
and
searched
upon
her
is
found
the
pot
of
cream
and
in
the
cream
mlle
celie
eardrops
she
has
slipped
into
mlle
celie
room
as
if
my
theory
was
correct
she
would
be
sure
to
do
and
put
the
pot
of
cream
into
her
pocket
so
i
am
now
fairly
sure
that
she
is
concerned
in
the
murder
we
then
went
to
mme
dauvray
room
and
discovered
her
brilliants
and
her
ornaments
at
once
the
meaning
of
that
agitated
piece
of
of
mlle
celie
becomes
clear
she
is
asked
where
the
jewels
are
hidden
she
can
not
answer
for
her
mouth
of
course
is
stopped
she
has
to
write
thus
my
conjectures
get
more
and
more
support
and
mind
this
one
of
the
two
women
is
guilty
celie
or
vauquier
my
discoveries
all
fit
in
with
the
theory
of
innocence
but
there
remain
the
footprints
for
which
i
found
no
explanation
you
will
remember
i
made
you
all
promise
silence
as
to
the
finding
of
mme
dauvray
jewellery
for
i
thought
if
they
have
taken
the
girl
away
so
that
suspicion
may
fall
on
her
and
not
on
vauquier
they
mean
to
dispose
of
her
but
they
may
keep
her
so
long
as
they
have
a
chance
of
finding
out
from
her
mme
dauvray
it
was
a
small
chance
but
our
only
one
the
moment
the
discovery
of
the
jewellery
was
published
the
girl
fate
was
sealed
were
my
theory
true
then
came
our
advertisement
and
mme
gobin
written
testimony
there
was
one
small
point
of
interest
which
i
will
take
first
her
statement
that
adele
was
the
christian
name
of
the
woman
with
the
red
hair
that
the
old
woman
who
was
the
servant
in
that
house
in
the
suburb
of
geneva
called
her
adele
just
simply
adele
that
interested
me
for
helene
vauquier
had
called
her
adele
too
when
she
was
describing
to
us
the
unknown
visitor
was
what
mme
dauvray
called
her
yes
said
ricardo
helene
vauquier
made
a
slip
there
she
should
have
given
her
a
false
name
hanaud
nodded
it
is
the
one
slip
she
made
in
the
whole
of
the
business
nor
did
she
recover
herself
very
cleverly
for
when
the
commissaire
pounced
upon
the
name
she
at
once
modified
her
words
she
only
thought
now
that
the
name
was
adele
or
something
like
it
but
when
i
went
on
to
suggest
that
the
name
in
any
case
would
be
a
false
one
at
once
she
went
back
upon
her
modifications
and
now
she
was
sure
that
adele
was
the
name
used
i
remembered
her
hesitation
when
i
read
marthe
gobin
letter
they
helped
to
confirm
me
in
my
theory
that
she
was
in
the
plot
and
they
made
me
very
sure
that
it
was
an
adele
for
whom
we
had
to
look
so
far
well
but
other
statements
in
the
letter
puzzled
me
for
instance
ran
lightly
and
quickly
across
the
pavement
into
the
house
as
though
she
were
afraid
to
be
seen
those
were
the
words
and
the
woman
was
obviously
honest
what
became
of
my
theory
then
the
girl
was
free
to
run
free
to
stoop
and
pick
up
the
train
of
her
gown
in
her
hand
free
to
shout
for
help
in
the
open
street
if
she
wanted
help
no
that
i
could
not
explain
until
that
afternoon
when
i
saw
mlle
eyes
fixed
upon
that
flask
as
lemerre
poured
a
little
out
and
burnt
a
hole
in
the
sack
then
i
understood
well
enough
the
fear
of
vitriol
hanaud
gave
an
uneasy
shudder
and
it
is
enough
to
make
any
one
afraid
that
i
can
tell
you
no
wonder
she
lay
still
as
a
mouse
upon
the
sofa
in
the
bedroom
no
wonder
she
ran
quickly
into
the
house
well
there
you
have
the
explanation
i
had
only
my
theory
to
work
upon
even
after
mme
gobin
evidence
but
as
it
happened
it
was
the
right
one
meanwhile
of
course
i
made
my
inquiries
into
wethermill
circumstances
my
good
friends
in
england
helped
me
they
were
precarious
he
owed
money
in
aix
money
at
his
hotel
we
knew
from
the
that
the
man
we
were
searching
for
had
returned
to
aix
things
began
to
look
black
for
wethermill
then
you
gave
me
a
little
piece
of
information
i
exclaimed
ricardo
with
a
start
yes
you
told
me
that
you
walked
up
to
the
hotel
with
harry
wethermill
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
separated
just
before
ten
a
glance
into
his
rooms
which
i
had
you
will
remember
that
when
we
had
discovered
the
i
suggested
that
we
should
go
to
harry
wethermill
rooms
and
talk
it
over
that
glance
enabled
me
to
see
that
he
could
very
easily
have
got
out
of
his
room
on
to
the
verandah
below
and
escaped
from
the
hotel
by
the
garden
quite
unseen
for
you
will
remember
that
whereas
your
rooms
look
out
to
the
front
and
on
to
the
slope
of
mont
revard
wethermill
look
out
over
the
garden
and
the
town
of
aix
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
he
could
have
reached
the
villa
rose
he
could
have
been
in
the
salon
before
ten
and
that
is
just
the
hour
which
suited
me
perfectly
and
as
he
got
out
unnoticed
so
he
could
return
so
he
did
return
my
friend
there
are
some
interesting
marks
upon
the
of
wethermill
room
and
upon
the
pillar
just
beneath
it
take
a
look
ricardo
when
you
return
to
your
hotel
but
that
was
not
all
we
talked
of
geneva
in
wethermill
room
and
of
the
distance
between
geneva
and
aix
do
you
remember
that
yes
replied
ricardo
do
you
remember
too
that
i
asked
him
for
a
yes
to
make
sure
of
the
distance
i
do
ah
but
it
was
not
to
make
sure
of
the
distance
that
i
asked
for
the
my
friend
i
asked
in
order
to
find
out
whether
harry
wethermill
had
a
at
all
which
gave
a
plan
of
the
roads
between
here
and
geneva
and
he
had
he
handed
it
to
me
at
once
and
quite
naturally
i
hope
that
i
took
it
calmly
but
i
was
not
at
all
calm
inside
for
it
was
a
new
which
by
the
way
he
bought
a
week
before
and
i
was
asking
myself
all
the
while
now
what
was
i
asking
myself
m
ricardo
no
said
ricardo
with
a
smile
i
am
growing
wary
i
will
not
tell
you
what
you
were
asking
yourself
hanaud
for
even
were
i
right
you
would
make
out
that
i
was
wrong
and
leap
upon
me
with
injuries
and
gibes
no
you
shall
drink
your
coffee
and
tell
me
of
your
own
accord
well
said
hanaud
laughing
i
will
tell
you
i
was
asking
myself
does
a
man
who
owns
no
who
hires
no
go
out
into
aix
and
buy
an
automobilist
with
what
object
and
i
found
it
an
interesting
question
harry
wethermill
was
not
the
man
to
go
upon
a
walking
tour
eh
oh
i
was
obtaining
evidence
but
then
came
an
overwhelming
thing
the
murder
of
marthe
gobin
we
know
now
how
he
did
it
he
walked
beside
the
cab
put
his
head
in
at
the
window
asked
you
come
in
answer
to
the
advertisement
and
stabbed
her
straight
to
the
heart
through
her
dress
the
dress
and
the
weapon
which
he
used
would
save
him
from
being
stained
with
her
blood
he
was
in
your
room
that
morning
when
we
were
at
the
station
as
i
told
you
he
left
his
glove
behind
he
was
searching
for
a
telegram
in
answer
to
your
advertisement
or
he
came
to
sound
you
he
had
already
received
his
telegram
from
hippolyte
he
was
like
a
fox
in
a
cage
snapping
at
every
one
twisting
vainly
this
way
and
that
way
risking
everything
and
every
one
to
save
his
precious
neck
marthe
gobin
was
in
the
way
she
is
killed
mlle
celie
is
a
danger
so
mile
celie
must
be
suppressed
and
off
goes
a
telegram
to
the
geneva
paper
handed
in
by
a
waiter
from
the
cafe
at
the
station
of
chambery
before
five
wethermill
went
to
chambery
that
afternoon
when
we
went
to
geneva
once
we
could
get
him
on
the
run
once
we
could
so
harry
and
bustle
him
that
he
must
take
risks
why
we
had
him
and
that
afternoon
he
had
to
take
them
so
that
even
before
marthe
gobin
was
killed
you
were
sure
that
wethermill
was
the
murderer
hanaud
face
clouded
over
you
put
your
finger
on
a
sore
place
ricardo
i
was
sure
but
i
still
wanted
evidence
to
convict
i
left
him
free
hoping
for
that
evidence
i
left
him
free
hoping
that
he
would
commit
himself
he
did
but
well
let
us
talk
of
some
one
else
what
of
mlle
celie
ricardo
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
i
have
a
sister
in
london
a
widow
he
said
she
is
kind
i
too
have
been
thinking
of
what
will
become
of
mlle
celie
i
wrote
to
my
sister
and
here
is
her
reply
mlle
celie
will
be
very
welcome
hanaud
stretched
out
his
hand
and
shook
ricardo
warmly
she
will
not
i
think
be
for
very
long
a
burden
she
is
young
she
will
