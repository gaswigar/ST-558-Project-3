the

by
james
boyle
in
this
enlightening
book
james
boyle
describes
what
he
calls
the
range
wars
of
the
information
age
today
heated
battles
over
intellectual
property
boyle
argues
that
just
as
every
informed
citizen
needs
to
know
at
least
something
about
the
environment
or
civil
rights
every
citizen
should
also
understand
intellectual
property
law
why
because
intellectual
property
rights
mark
out
the
ground
rules
of
the
information
society
and
today
policies
are
unbalanced
unsupported
by
evidence
and
often
detrimental
to
cultural
access
free
speech
digital
creativity
and
scientific
innovation
boyle
identifies
as
a
major
problem
the
widespread
failure
to
understand
the
importance
of
the
public
domain
the
realm
of
material
that
everyone
is
free
to
use
and
share
without
permission
or
fee
the
public
domain
is
as
vital
to
innovation
and
culture
as
the
realm
of
material
protected
by
intellectual
property
rights
he
asserts
and
he
calls
for
a
movement
akin
to
the
environmental
movement
to
preserve
it
with
a
clear
analysis
of
issues
ranging
from
jefferson
philosophy
of
innovation
to
musical
sampling
synthetic
biology
and
internet
file
sharing
this
timely
book
brings
a
positive
new
perspective
to
important
cultural
and
legal
debates
if
we
continue
to
enclose

for
a

sandwich
in
the
curiously
mangled
form
of
english
that
patent
law
produces
it
was
described
this
way
a
sealed
crustless
sandwich
for
providing
a
convenient
sandwich
without
an
outer
crust
which
can
be
stored
for
long
periods
of
time
without
a
central
filling
from
leaking
outwardly
the
sandwich
includes
a
lower
bread
portion
an
upper
bread
portion
an
upper
filling
and
a
lower
filling
between
the
lower
and
upper
bread
portions
a

sealed
between
the
upper
and
lower

and
a
crimped
edge
along
an
outer
perimeter
of
the
bread
portions
for
sealing
the

there
between
the
upper

are
preferably
comprised

the

the

is
prevented
from
radiating

through
the
bread

from
the
surrounding

why
does
this
upset
you
i
asked

are

not
expire
until
seventy
years
after
my
death
the

but
still
you
will
allow
me
to
hope
that
this

put
it

fences
to
enclose
their
in
some
cases
it
effectively
removes
the
privilege
of
fair
use
each
day
brings
some
new
internet
horror
story
about
the
excesses
of
intellectual
property
some
of
them
are
even
true
the
list
goes
on
and
on
by
the
end
of
this
book
i
hope
to
have
convinced
you
that
this
matters
with
all
of
this
going
on
this
enclosure
movement
of
the
mind
this
locking
up
of
symbols
and
themes
and
facts
and
genes
and
ideas
and
eventually
people
why
get
excited
about
the
patenting
of
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
i
just
thought
that
there
were
limits
he
said
some
things
should
be
sacred
this
book
is
an
attempt
to
tell
the
story
of
the
battles
over
intellectual
property
the
range
wars
of
the
information
age
i
want
to
convince
you
that
intellectual
property
is
important
that
it
is
something
that
any
informed
citizen
needs
to
know
a
little
about
in
the
same
way
that
any
informed
citizen
needs
to
know
at
least
something
about
the
environment
or
civil
rights
or
the
way
the
economy
works
i
will
try
my
best
to
be
fair
to
explain
the
issues
and
give
both
sides
of
the
argument
still
you
should
know
that
this
is
more
than
mere
description
in
the
pages
that
follow
i
try
to
show
that
current
intellectual
property
policy
is
overwhelmingly
and
tragically
bad
in
ways
that
everyone
and
not
just
lawyers
or
economists
should
care
about
we
are
making
bad
decisions
that
will
have
a
negative
effect
on
our
culture
our
kids
schools
and
our
communications
networks
on
free
speech
medicine
and
scientific
research
we
are
wasting
some
of
the
promise
of
the
internet
running
the
risk
of
ruining
an
amazing
system
of
scientific
innovation
carving
out
an
intellectual
property
exemption
to
the
first
amendment
i
do
not
write
this
as
an
enemy
of
intellectual
property
a
ready
to
end
all
property
rights
in
fact
i
am
a
fan
it
is
precisely
because
i
am
a
fan
that
i
am
so
alarmed
about
the
direction
we
are
taking
still
the
message
of
this
book
is
neither
doom
nor
gloom
none
of
these
decisions
is
irrevocable
the
worst
ones
can
still
be
avoided
altogether
and
there
are
powerful
counterweights
in
both
law
and
culture
to
the
negative
trends
i
describe
here
there
are
lots
of
reasons
for
optimism
i
will
get
to
most
of
these
later
but
one
bears
mentioning
now
contrary
to
what
everyone
has
told
you
the
subject
of
intellectual
property
is
both
accessible
and
interesting
what
people
can
understand
they
can
change
or
pressure
their
legislators
to
change
i
stress
this
point
because
i
want
to
challenge
a
kind
of
willed
ignorance
every
news
story
refers
to
intellectual
property
as
arcane
technical
or
abstruse
in
the
same
way
as
they
referred
to
former
attorney
general
alberto
gonzales
as
controversial
it
is
a
verbal
tic
and
it
serves
to
reinforce
the
idea
that
this
is
something
about
which
popular
debate
is
impossible
but
it
is
also
wrong
the
central
issues
of
intellectual
property
are
not
technical
abstruse
or
arcane
to
be
sure
the
rules
of
intellectual
property
law
can
be
as
complex
as
a
tax
code
though
they
should
not
be
but
at
the
heart
of
intellectual
property
law
are
a
set
of
ideas
that
a
can
understand
perfectly
well
while
writing
this
book
i
checked
this
on
a
i
then
happened
to
have
around
the
house
you
do
not
need
to
be
a
scientist
or
an
economist
or
a
lawyer
to
understand
it
the
stuff
is
also
a
lot
of
fun
to
think
about
i
live
in
constant
wonder
that
they
pay
me
to
do
so
should
you
be
able
to
tell
the
story
of
gone
with
the
wind
from
a
slave
point
of
view
even
if
the
author
does
not
want
you
to
should
the
dallas
cowboys
be
able
to
stop
the
release
of
debbie
does
dallas
a
cheesy
porno
flick
in
which
the
title
character
brings
great
dishonor
to
a
uniform
similar
to
that
worn
by
the
dallas
cowboys
cheerleaders
after
all
the
audience
might
end
up
associating
the
dallas
cowboys
cheerleaders
with
well
commodified
sexuality
should
the
commerce
department
be
able
to
patent
the
genes
of
a
guyami
indian
woman
who
shows
an
unusual
resistance
to
leukemia
what
would
it
mean
to
patent
someone
genes
anyway
forbidding
scientific
research
on
the
gene
without
the
patent
holder
consent
forbidding
human
reproduction
can
religions
secure
copyrights
over
their
scriptures
even
the
ones
they
claim
to
have
been
dictated
by
gods
or
aliens
even
if
american
copyright
law
requires
an
author
presumably
a
human
one
can
they
use
those
copyrights
to
discipline
heretics
or
critics
who
insist
on
quoting
the
scripture
in
full
should
anyone
own
the
protocols
the
common
technical
standards
that
make
the
internet
possible
does
reading
a
web
page
count
as
copying
it
should
that
question
depend
on
technical
facts
for
example
how
long
the
page
stays
in
your
browser
cache
or
should
it
depend
on
some
choice
that
we
want
to
make
about
the
extent
of
the
copyright
holder
rights
these
questions
may
be
hard
because
the
underlying
moral
and
political
and
economic
issues
need
to
be
thought
through
they
may
be
weird
alien
scriptural
dictation
might
qualify
there
they
surely
are
uninteresting
although
i
admit
to
a
certain
prejudice
on
that
point
and
some
of
them
like
the
design
of
our
telecommunications
networks
or
the
patenting
of
human
genes
or
the
relationship
between
copyright
and
free
speech
are
not
merely
interesting
they
are
important
it
seems
like
a
bad
idea
to
leave
them
to
a
few
lawyers
and
lobbyists
simply
because
you
are
told
they
are
technical
so
the
first
goal
of
the
book
is
to
introduce
you
to
intellectual
property
to
explain
why
it
matters
why
it
is
the
legal
form
of
the
information
age
the
second
goal
is
to
persuade
you
that
our
intellectual
property
policy
is
going
the
wrong
way
two
roads
are
diverging
and
we
are
on
the
one
that
does
lead
to
rome
the
third
goal
is
harder
to
explain
we
have
a
simple
word
for
and
an
intuitive
understanding
of
the
complex
reality
of
property
admittedly
lawyers
think
about
property
differently
from
the
way
do
this
is
only
one
of
the
strange
mental
changes
that
law
school
brings
but
everyone
in
our
society
has
a
richly
textured
understanding
of
mine
and
thine
of
rights
of
exclusion
of
division
of
rights
over
the
same
property
for
example
between
tenant
and
landlord
of
transfer
of
rights
in
part
or
in
whole
for
example
rental
or
sale
but
what
about
the
opposite
of
property
antonym
property
outside
what
is
it
is
it
just
stuff
that
is
not
worth
owning
abandoned
junk
stuff
that
is
not
yet
owned
such
as
a
seashell
on
a
public
beach
about
to
be
taken
home
or
stuff
that
can
not
be
owned
a
human
being
for
example
or
stuff
that
is
collectively
owned
would
that
be
the
radio
spectrum
or
a
public
park
or
stuff
that
is
owned
by
no
one
such
as
the
deep
seabed
or
the
moon
property
outside
whether
it
is
the
public
domain
or
the
commons
turns
out
to
be
harder
to
grasp
than
its
inside
to
the
extent
that
we
think
about
property
outside
it
tends
to
have
a
negative
connotation
we
want
to
get
stuff
out
of
the
office
and
back
into
circulation
as
property
we
talk
of
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
meaning
that
unowned
or
collectively
owned
resources
will
be
managed
poorly
the
common
pasture
will
be
overgrazed
by
the
villagers
sheep
because
no
one
has
an
incentive
to
hold
back
when
the
subject
is
intellectual
property
this
gap
in
our
knowledge
turns
out
to
be
important
because
our
intellectual
property
system
depends
on
a
balance
between
what
is
property
and
what
is
not
for
a
set
of
reasons
that
i
will
explain
later
the
opposite
of
property
is
a
concept
that
is
much
more
important
when
we
come
to
the
world
of
ideas
information
expression
and
invention
we
want
a
lot
of
material
to
be
in
the
public
domain
material
that
can
be
spread
without
property
rights
the
general
rule
of
law
is
that
the
noblest
of
human
productions
knowledge
truths
ascertained
conceptions
and
ideas
become
after
voluntary
communication
to
others
free
as
the
air
to
common
use
our
art
our
culture
our
science
depend
on
this
public
domain
every
bit
as
much
as
they
depend
on
intellectual
property
the
third
goal
of
this
book
is
to
explore
property
outside
property
various
antonyms
and
to
show
how
we
are
undervaluing
the
public
domain
and
the
information
commons
at
the
very
moment
in
history
when
we
need
them
most
academic
articles
and
clever
legal
briefs
can
not
solve
this
problem
alone
instead
i
argue
that
precisely
because
we
are
in
the
information
age
we
need
a
movement
akin
to
the
environmental
movement
to
preserve
the
public
domain
the
explosion
of
industrial
technologies
that
threatened
the
environment
also
taught
us
to
recognize
its
value
the
explosion
of
information
technologies
has
precipitated
an
intellectual
land
grab
it
must
also
teach
us
about
both
the
existence
and
the
value
of
the
public
domain
this
enlightenment
does
not
happen
by
itself
the
environmentalists
helped
us
to
see
the
world
differently
to
see
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
environment
rather
than
just
my
pond
your
forest
his
canal
we
need
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
information
environment
we
have
to
invent
the
public
domain
before
we
can
save
it
a
word
about
style
i
am
trying
to
write
about
complicated
issues
some
of
which
have
been
neglected
by
academic
scholarship
while
others
have
been
catalogued
in
detail
i
want
to
advance
the
field
to
piece
together
the
story
of
the
second
enclosure
movement
to
tell
you
something
new
about
the
balance
between
property
and
its
opposite
but
i
want
to
do
so
in
a
way
that
is
readable
for
those
in
my
profession
being
readable
is
a
dangerous
goal
you
have
never
heard
true
condescension
until
you
have
heard
academics
pronounce
the
word
popularizer
they
say
it
as
isadora
duncan
might
have
said
dowdy
to
be
honest
i
share
their
concern
all
too
often
clarity
is
achieved
by
leaving
out
the
key
qualification
necessary
to
the
argument
the
subtlety
of
meaning
the
inconvenient
empirical
evidence
my
solution
is
not
a
terribly
satisfactory
one
a
lot
of
material
has
been
exiled
to
endnotes
the
endnotes
for
each
chapter
also
include
a
short
guide
to
further
reading
i
have
used
citations
sparingly
but
more
widely
than
an
author
of
a
popular
book
normally
does
so
that
the
scholarly
audience
can
trace
out
my
reasoning
but
the
core
of
the
argument
is
in
the
text
the
second
balance
i
have
struggled
to
hit
is
that
between
breadth
and
depth
the
central
thesis
of
the
book
is
that
the
line
between
intellectual
property
and
the
public
domain
is
important
in
every
area
of
culture
science
and
technology
as
a
result
it
ranges
widely
in
subject
matter
yet
readers
come
with
different
backgrounds
interests
and
bodies
of
knowledge
as
a
result
the
structure
of
the
book
is
designed
to
facilitate
based
on
interest
the
first
three
chapters
and
the
conclusion
provide
the
theoretical
basis
each
chapter
builds
on
those
themes
but
is
also
designed
to
be
largely
freestanding
the
readers
who
thrill
to
the
idea
that
there
might
be
constitutional
challenges
to
the
regulation
of
digital
speech
by
copyright
law
may
wallow
in
those
arguments
to
their
hearts
content
others
may
quickly
grasp
the
gist
and
head
on
for
the
story
of
how
ray
charles
voice
ended
up
in
a
mashup
attacking
president
bush
or
the
discussion
of
genetically
engineered
bacteria
that
take
photographs
and
are
themselves
the
subject
of
intellectual
property
rights
to
those
readers
who
nevertheless
conclude
that
i
have
failed
to
balance
correctly
between
precision
and
clarity
or
breadth
and
depth
i
offer
my
apologies
i
fear
you
may
be
right
it
was
not
for
want
of
trying
chapter
why
intellectual
property
imagine
yourself
starting
a
society
from
scratch
perhaps
you
fought
a
revolution
or
perhaps
you
led
a
party
of
adventurers
into
some
empty
land
conveniently
free
of
indigenous
peoples
now
your
task
is
to
make
the
society
work
you
have
a
preference
for
democracy
and
liberty
and
you
want
a
vibrant
culture
a
culture
with
a
little
chunk
of
everything
one
that
offers
hundreds
of
ways
to
live
and
thousands
of
ideals
of
beauty
you
do
want
everything
to
be
high
culture
you
want
beer
and
skittles
and
trashy
delights
as
well
as
brilliant
news
reporting
theater
and
shocking
sculpture
you
can
see
a
role
for
highbrow
media
or
publicly
financed
artworks
but
your
initial
working
assumption
is
that
the
final
arbiter
of
culture
should
be
the
people
who
watch
read
and
listen
to
it
and
who
remake
it
every
day
and
even
if
you
are
dubious
about
the
way
popular
choice
gets
formed
you
prefer
it
to
some
government
funding
body
or
coterie
of
art
mavens
at
the
same
time
as
you
are
developing
your
culture
you
want
a
flourishing
economy
and
not
just
in
literature
or
film
you
want
innovation
and
invention
you
want
drugs
that
cure
terrible
diseases
and
designs
for
more
stoves
and
useful
little
doodads
like
mousetraps
or
notes
or
powered
backscratchers
to
be
exact
you
want
lots
of
innovation
but
you
do
not
know
exactly
what
innovation
or
even
what
types
of
innovation
you
want
given
scarce
time
and
resources
should
we
try
to
improve
typewriters
or
render
them
obsolete
with
word
processors
or
develop
functional
voice
recognition
software
or
just
concentrate
on
making
backscratchers
who
knew
that
they
needed
notes
or
surgical
stents
or
specialized
rice
planters
until
those
things
were
actually
developed
how
do
you
make
priorities
when
the
priorities
include
things
you
can
not
rationally
value
because
you
do
not
have
them
yet
how
do
you
decide
what
to
fund
and
when
to
fund
it
what
desires
to
trade
off
against
each
other
the
society
you
have
founded
normally
relies
on
market
signals
to
allocate
resources
if
a
lot
of
people
want
petunias
for
their
gardens
and
are
willing
to
pay
handsomely
for
them
then
some
farmer
who
was
formerly
growing
soybeans
or
gourds
will
devote
a
field
to
petunias
instead
he
will
compete
with
the
other
petunia
sellers
to
sell
them
to
you
voila
we
do
not
need
a
state
planner
to
consult
the
vegetable
plan
and
decree
petunias
for
the
people
instead
the
decision
about
how
to
deploy
society
productive
resources
is
being
made
automatically
cybernetically
even
by
rational
individuals
responding
to
price
signals
and
in
a
competitive
market
you
will
get
your
petunias
at
very
close
to
the
cost
of
growing
them
and
bringing
them
to
market
consumer
desires
are
satisfied
and
productive
resources
are
allocated
efficiently
it
a
tour
de
force
of
course
there
are
problems
the
market
measures
the
value
of
a
good
by
whether
people
have
the
ability
and
willingness
to
pay
for
it
so
the
whims
of
the
rich
may
be
more
valuable
than
the
needs
of
the
destitute
we
may
spend
more
on
pet
psychiatry
for
the
traumatized
poodles
on
east
street
than
on
developing
a
cure
for
sleeping
sickness
because
the
emotional
wellbeing
of
the
pets
of
the
wealthy
is
worth
more
than
the
lives
of
the
tropical
world
poor
but
for
a
lot
of
products
in
a
lot
of
areas
the
market
works
and
that
is
a
fact
not
to
be
taken
for
granted
why
not
use
this
mechanism
to
meet
your
cultural
and
innovation
needs
if
people
need
madame
bovary
or
the
new
york
times
or
a
new
kind
of
antibiotic
surely
the
market
will
provide
it
apparently
not
you
have
brought
economists
with
you
into
your
brave
new
world
perhaps
out
of
nostalgia
or
because
a
lot
of
packing
got
done
at
the
last
minute
the
economists
shake
their
the
petunia
farmer
is
selling
something
that
is
a
rivalrous
good
if
i
have
the
petunia
you
ca
have
it
what
more
petunias
are
excludable
the
farmer
only
gives
you
petunias
when
you
pay
for
them
it
is
these
factors
that
make
the
petunia
market
work
what
about
madame
bovary
or
the
antibiotic
or
the
new
york
times
well
it
depends
if
books
have
to
be
copied
out
by
hand
then
madame
bovary
is
just
like
the
petunia
but
if
thousands
of
copies
of
madame
bovary
can
be
printed
on
a
printing
press
or
photocopied
or
downloaded
from
then
the
book
becomes
something
that
is
nonrival
once
madame
bovary
is
written
it
can
satisfy
many
readers
with
little
additional
effort
or
cost
indeed
depending
on
the
technologies
of
reproduction
it
may
be
very
hard
to
exclude
people
from
madame
bovary
imagine
a
napster
for
french
literature
everyone
could
have
madame
bovary
and
only
the
first
purchaser
would
have
to
pay
for
it
because
of
these
nonrival
and
nonexcludable
characteristics
flaubert
publisher
would
have
a
more
difficult
time
coming
up
with
a
business
plan
than
the
petunia
farmer
the
same
is
true
for
the
drug
company
that
invests
millions
in
screening
and
testing
various
drug
candidates
and
ends
up
with
a
new
antibiotic
that
is
both
safe
and
effective
but
which
can
be
copied
for
pennies
who
will
invest
the
money
knowing
that
any
product
can
be
undercut
by
copies
that
have
to
pay
the
research
costs
how
are
authors
and
publishers
and
drug
manufacturers
to
make
money
and
if
they
ca
make
money
how
are
we
to
induce
people
to
be
authors
or
to
be
the
investors
who
put
money
into
the
publishing
or
pharmaceutical
business
it
is
important
to
pause
at
this
point
and
inquire
how
closely
reality
hews
to
the
economic
story
of
nonexcludable
and
nonrival
public
goods
it
turns
out
that
the
reality
is
much
more
complex
first
there
may
be
motivations
for
creation
that
do
not
depend
on
the
market
mechanism
people
sometimes
create
because
they
seek
fame
or
out
of
altruism
or
because
an
inherent
creative
force
will
not
let
them
do
otherwise
where
those
motivations
operate
we
may
not
need
a
financial
incentive
to
create
thus
the
problem
of
cheap
copying
in
fact
becomes
a
virtue
second
the
same
technologies
that
make
copying
cheaper
may
also
lower
the
costs
of
advertising
and
distribution
cutting
down
on
the
need
to
finance
expensive
distribution
chains
third
even
in
situations
that
do
require
incentives
for
creativity
and
for
distribution
it
may
be
that
being
first
to
market
with
an
innovation
provides
the
innovator
with
enough
of
a
head
start
on
the
competition
to
support
the
fourth
while
some
aspects
of
the
innovation
may
truly
be
nonrival
other
aspects
may
not
software
is
nonrival
and
hard
to
exclude
people
from
but
it
is
easy
to
exclude
your
customers
from
the
help
line
or
technical
support
the
cd
may
be
copied
cheaply
the
concert
is
easy
to
police
the
innovator
may
even
be
advantaged
by
being
able
to
trade
on
the
likely
effects
of
her
innovation
if
i
know
i
have
developed
the
digital
camera
i
may
sell
the
conventional
film
company
shares
short
guarantees
of
authenticity
quality
and
ease
of
use
may
attract
purchasers
even
if
unauthorized
copying
is
theoretically
cheaper
in
other
words
the
economic
model
of
pure
public
goods
will
track
our
reality
well
in
some
areas
and
poorly
in
others
and
the
argument
for
state
intervention
to
fix
the
problems
of
public
goods
will
therefore
wax
and
wane
correspondingly
in
the
case
of
drug
patents
for
example
it
is
very
strong
for
lots
of
business
innovation
however
we
believe
that
adequate
incentives
are
provided
by
being
first
to
market
and
so
we
see
no
need
to
give
monopoly
power
to
the
first
business
to
come
up
with
a
new
business
plan
at
least
we
did
not
until
some
disastrous
patent
law
decisions
discussed
later
in
this
book
nor
does
a
lowering
of
copying
costs
hurt
every
industry
equally
digital
copies
of
music
were
a
threat
to
the
traditional
music
business
but
digital
copies
of
books
i
am
skeptical
this
book
will
be
freely
and
legally
available
online
to
all
who
wish
to
copy
it
both
the
publisher
and
i
believe
that
this
will
increase
rather
than
decrease
sales
ignore
these
inconvenient
complicating
factors
for
a
moment
assume
that
wherever
things
are
cheap
to
copy
and
hard
to
exclude
others
from
we
have
a
potential
collapse
of
the
market
that
book
that
drug
that
film
will
simply
not
be
produced
in
the
first
place
unless
the
state
steps
in
somehow
to
change
the
equation
this
is
the
standard
argument
for
intellectual
property
rights
and
a
very
good
argument
it
is
in
order
to
solve
the
potentially
marketbreaking
problem
of
goods
that
are
expensive
to
make
and
cheap
to
copy
we
will
use
what
my
colleague
jerry
reichman
calls
the
device
of
intellectual
property
the
state
will
create
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
the
invention
or
the
expression
and
confer
it
on
the
inventor
or
the
author
the
most
familiar
rights
of
this
kind
are
copyrights
and
patents
trademarks
present
some
special
issues
which
i
will
address
a
little
later
having
been
given
the
ability
to
forbid
people
to
copy
your
invention
or
your
novel
you
can
make
them
pay
for
the
privilege
of
getting
access
you
have
been
put
back
in
the
position
of
the
petunia
farmer
pause
for
a
moment
and
think
of
what
a
brilliant
social
innovation
this
is
at
least
potentially
focus
not
on
the
incentives
alone
but
on
the
decentralization
of
information
processing
and
decision
making
that
a
market
offers
instead
of
having
ministries
of
art
that
define
the
appropriate
culture
to
be
produced
this
year
or
turning
the
entire
path
of
national
innovation
policy
over
to
the
government
intellectual
property
decentralizes
the
choices
about
what
creative
and
innovative
paths
to
pursue
while
retaining
the
possibility
that
people
will
actually
get
paid
for
their
innovation
and
creative
expression
the
promise
of
copyright
is
this
if
you
are
a
radical
environmentalist
who
wants
to
alert
the
world
to
the
danger
posed
by
climate
change
or
a
passionate
advocate
of
homeschooling
or
a
cartoonist
with
a
uniquely
twisted
view
of
life
or
a
musician
who
can
make
a
slack
key
guitar
do
very
strange
things
or
a
person
who
likes
to
take
amazingly
saccharine
pictures
of
puppies
and
put
them
on
greeting
cards
maybe
you
can
quit
your
day
job
and
actually
make
a
living
from
your
expressive
powers
if
the
market
works
if
the
middlemen
and
distributors
are
smart
enough
competitive
enough
and
willing
to
take
a
chance
on
expression
that
competes
with
their
talent
if
you
can
make
it
somehow
into
the
public
consciousness
then
you
can
be
paid
for
allowing
the
world
to
copy
distribute
and
perform
your
stuff
you
risk
your
time
and
your
effort
and
your
passion
and
if
the
market
likes
it
you
will
be
rewarded
at
the
very
least
the
giant
producers
of
culture
will
be
able
to
assemble
vast
teams
of
animators
and
musicians
and
software
gurus
and
meld
their
labors
into
a
videotape
that
will
successfully
anesthetize
your
children
for
two
hours
no
small
accomplishment
let
me
tell
you
and
one
for
which
people
will
certainly
pay
more
importantly
if
the
system
works
the
choices
about
the
content
of
our
culture
the
mix
of
earnest
essays
and
saccharine
greeting
cards
and
scantily
clad
singers
and
poetic
renditions
of
norse
myths
will
be
decentralized
to
the
people
who
actually
read
or
listen
to
or
watch
the
stuff
this
is
our
cultural
policy
and
it
is
driven
in
part
by
copyright
the
promise
of
patent
is
this
we
have
a
multitude
of
human
needs
and
a
multitude
of
individuals
and
firms
who
might
be
able
to
satisfy
those
needs
through
innovation
patent
law
offers
us
a
decentralized
system
that
in
principle
will
allow
individuals
and
firms
to
pick
the
problem
that
they
wish
to
solve
inventors
and
entrepreneurs
can
risk
their
time
and
their
capital
and
if
they
produce
a
solution
that
finds
favor
in
the
marketplace
will
be
able
to
reap
the
return
provided
by
the
legal
right
to
exclude
by
the
legal
monopoly
over
the
resulting
invention
the
market
hints
at
some
unmet
need
for
drugs
that
might
reduce
obesity
or
cure
multiple
sclerosis
or
for
notes
or
windshield
wipers
that
come
on
intermittently
in
light
rain
and
the
innovator
and
her
investors
make
a
bet
that
they
can
meet
that
need
not
all
of
these
technologies
will
be
patentable
only
those
that
are
novel
and
nonobvious
something
that
goes
beyond
what
any
skilled
person
in
the
relevant
field
would
have
done
in
return
for
the
legal
monopoly
patent
holders
must
describe
the
technology
well
enough
to
allow
anyone
to
replicate
it
once
the
patent
term
ends
thus
patent
law
allows
us
to
avert
two
dangers
the
danger
that
the
innovation
will
languish
because
the
inventor
has
no
way
to
recover
her
investment
of
time
and
capital
and
the
danger
that
the
inventor
will
turn
to
secrecy
instead
hiding
the
details
of
her
innovation
behind
black
box
technologies
and
restrictive
contracts
so
that
society
never
gets
the
knowledge
embedded
in
it
this
is
a
real
danger
the
medieval
guilds
often
relied
on
secrecy
to
maintain
the
commercial
advantage
conveyed
by
their
special
skills
thus
slowing
progress
down
and
sometimes
simply
stopping
it
we
still
do
know
how
they
made
stradivarius
violins
sound
so
good
patents
by
contrast
keep
the
knowledge
public
at
least
in
theory
you
must
describe
it
to
own
it
and
again
decisions
about
the
direction
of
innovation
have
been
largely
though
not
entirely
decentralized
to
the
people
who
actually
might
use
the
products
and
services
that
result
this
is
our
innovation
policy
and
it
is
increasingly
driven
by
patent
what
about
the
legal
protection
of
trademarks
the
little
words
or
symbols
or
product
shapes
that
identify
products
for
us
why
do
we
have
trademark
law
this
homestead
law
for
the
english
language
why
not
simply
allow
anyone
to
use
any
name
or
attractive
symbol
that
they
want
on
their
products
even
if
someone
else
used
it
first
a
trademark
gives
me
a
limited
right
to
exclude
other
people
from
using
my
mark
or
brand
name
or
product
shape
just
as
copyright
and
patent
law
give
me
a
limited
right
to
exclude
other
people
from
my
original
expression
or
my
novel
invention
why
create
such
a
right
and
back
it
with
the
force
of
law
according
to
the
economists
the
answer
is
that
trademark
law
does
two
things
it
saves
consumers
time
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
a
soap
that
says
ivory
or
a
tub
of
ice
cream
that
says
will
be
made
by
the
same
manufacturer
that
made
the
last
batch
of
ivory
soap
or
ice
cream
if
we
liked
the
good
before
and
we
see
the
symbol
again
we
know
what
we
are
getting
i
can
work
out
what
kind
of
soap
ice
cream
or
car
i
like
and
then
just
look
for
the
appropriate
sign
rather
than
investigating
the
product
all
over
again
each
time
i
buy
that
would
be
wasteful
and
economists
hate
waste
at
the
same
time
trademarks
fulfill
a
second
function
they
are
supposed
to
give
manufacturers
an
incentive
to
make
good
products
or
at
least
to
make
products
of
consistent
quality
or
price
to
build
up
a
good
brand
name
and
invest
in
consistency
of
its
key
features
knowing
that
no
other
firm
can
take
their
name
or
symbol
why
produce
a
product
or
a
reliable
cheap
product
and
build
a
big
market
share
if
a
free
rider
could
wait
until
people
liked
the
product
and
then
just
produce
an
imitation
with
the
same
name
but
of
lower
quality
the
promise
of
trademark
is
that
quality
and
commercial
information
flow
regulate
themselves
with
rational
consumers
judging
among
goods
of
consistent
quality
produced
by
manufacturers
with
an
interest
in
building
up
reputation
so
there
we
have
the
idealized
vision
of
intellectual
property
it
is
not
merely
supposed
to
produce
incentives
for
innovation
by
rewarding
creators
though
that
is
vital
intellectual
property
is
also
supposed
to
create
a
feedback
mechanism
that
dictates
the
contours
of
information
and
innovation
production
it
is
not
an
overstatement
to
say
that
intellectual
property
rights
are
designed
to
shape
our
information
marketplace
copyright
law
is
supposed
to
give
us
a
cultural
policy
in
which
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
one
original
expression
fuels
a
vibrant
public
sphere
indirectly
driven
by
popular
demand
at
its
best
it
is
supposed
to
allow
a
decentralized
and
iconoclastic
cultural
ferment
in
which
independent
artists
musicians
and
writers
can
take
their
unique
visions
histories
poems
or
songs
to
the
world
and
make
a
living
doing
so
if
their
work
finds
favor
patent
law
is
supposed
to
give
us
a
innovation
policy
in
which
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
novel
and
useful
inventions
creates
a
cybernetic
and
responsive
innovation
marketplace
the
allocation
of
social
resources
to
particular
types
of
innovation
is
driven
by
guesses
about
what
the
market
wants
trademark
law
is
supposed
to
give
us
a
commercial
information
policy
in
which
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
one
trade
name
symbol
or
slogan
produces
a
market
for
consumer
information
in
which
firms
have
incentives
to
establish
quality
brand
names
and
consumers
can
rely
on
the
meaning
and
the
stability
of
the
logos
that
surround
them
ivory
soap
will
always
mean
ivory
soap
and
coke
will
mean
coke
at
least
until
the
owners
of
those
marks
decide
to
change
the
nature
of
their
products
some
readers
will
find
my
use
of
the
term
intellectual
property
mistaken
and
offensive
they
will
argue
and
i
agree
that
the
use
of
the
term
property
can
cause
people
mistakenly
to
conflate
these
rights
with
those
to
physical
property
i
outline
that
process
and
its
negative
consequences
in
the
next
chapter
they
will
argue
and
again
i
agree
that
there
are
big
differences
between
the
three
fields
i
have
described
should
we
not
just
list
the
specific
rights
about
which
we
are
speaking
copyright
patent
or
trademark
both
of
these
concerns
are
real
and
but
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
conclusion
that
we
should
give
up
the
term
intellectual
property
first
as
i
have
tried
to
show
above
while
there
are
considerable
differences
between
the
three
fields
i
discussed
there
is
also
a
core
similarity
the
attempt
to
use
a
legally
created
privilege
to
solve
a
potential
public
goods
problem
that
similarity
can
enlighten
as
well
as
confuse
yes
copyright
looks
very
different
from
patent
just
as
a
whale
looks
very
different
from
a
mouse
but
we
do
not
condemn
the
scientist
who
notes
that
they
are
both
mammals
a
socially
constructed
category
so
long
as
he
has
a
reason
for
focusing
on
that
commonality
second
the
language
of
intellectual
property
exists
it
has
political
reality
in
the
world
sometimes
the
language
confuses
and
misleads
there
are
two
possible
reactions
to
such
a
reality
one
can
reject
it
and
insist
on
a
different
and
purified
nomenclature
or
one
can
attempt
to
point
out
the
misperceptions
and
confusions
using
the
very
language
in
which
they
are
embedded
i
do
not
reject
the
first
tactic
it
can
be
useful
here
though
i
have
embraced
the
second
i
have
provided
the
idealized
story
of
intellectual
property
but
is
it
true
did
the
law
really
develop
that
way
does
it
work
that
way
now
does
this
story
still
apply
in
the
world
of
the
internet
and
the
human
genome
project
if
you
believed
the
idealized
story
would
you
know
what
kind
of
intellectual
property
laws
to
write
the
answer
to
all
of
these
questions
is
not
exactly
like
most
social
institutions
intellectual
property
has
an
altogether
messier
and
more
interesting
history
than
this
sanitized
version
of
its
functioning
would
suggest
the
precursors
of
copyright
law
served
to
force
the
identification
of
the
author
so
that
he
could
be
punished
if
he
proved
to
be
a
heretic
or
a
revolutionary
the
statute
of
anne
the
first
true
copyright
statute
was
produced
partly
because
of
fights
with
booksellers
the
authorial
right
grew
as
an
the
history
of
patents
includes
a
wealth
of
attempts
to
reward
friends
of
the
government
and
restrict
or
control
dangerous
technologies
trademark
law
has
shuttled
uneasily
between
being
a
way
to
police
competition
so
as
to
prohibit
actions
that
courts
thought
were
unfair
and
an
absolute
property
right
over
an
individual
word
or
symbol
but
does
intellectual
property
work
this
way
now
promoting
the
ideal
of
progress
a
transparent
marketplace
easy
and
cheap
access
to
information
decentralized
and
iconoclastic
cultural
production
innovation
policy
often
it
does
but
distressingly
often
it
does
the
reverse
the
rights
that
were
supposed
to
be
limited
in
time
and
scope
to
the
minimum
monopoly
necessary
to
ensure
production
become
instead
a
kind
of
perpetual
corporate
welfare
restraining
the
next
generation
of
creators
instead
of
encouraging
them
the
system
that
was
supposed
to
harness
the
genius
of
both
the
market
and
democracy
sometimes
subverts
both
worse
it
does
so
inefficiently
locking
up
vast
swaths
of
culture
in
order
to
confer
a
benefit
on
a
tiny
minority
of
works
but
this
is
too
abstract
a
single
instance
from
copyright
law
will
serve
as
a
concrete
example
of
what
is
at
stake
here
later
in
the
book
i
will
give
other
examples
you
get
my
library
of
congress
when
go
to
the
library
of
congress
catalogue
it
is
online
at
http
this
is
an
astounding
repository
of
material
not
just
books
and
periodicals
but
pictures
films
and
music
the
vast
majority
of
this
material
perhaps
as
much
as
percent
in
the
case
of
books
is
commercially
the
process
happens
comparatively
quickly
estimates
suggest
that
a
mere
years
after
publication
percent
of
the
works
are
no
longer
being
commercially
produced
we
know
that
when
copyright
required
renewal
after
years
about
percent
of
all
copyright
holders
did
not
bother
to
renew
this
is
a
reasonable
if
rough
guide
to
commercial
viability
yet
because
the
copyright
term
is
now
so
long
in
many
cases
extending
well
over
a
century
most
of
culture
is
still
under
copyright
copyrighted
but
unavailable
much
of
this
in
other
words
is
lost
culture
no
one
is
reprinting
the
books
screening
the
films
or
playing
the
songs
no
one
is
allowed
to
in
fact
we
may
not
even
know
who
holds
the
copyright
companies
have
gone
out
of
business
records
are
incomplete
or
absent
in
some
cases
it
is
even
more
complicated
a
film
for
example
might
have
one
copyright
over
the
sound
track
another
over
the
movie
footage
and
another
over
the
script
you
get
the
idea
these
works
which
are
commercially
unavailable
and
also
have
no
identifiable
copyright
holder
are
called
orphan
works
they
make
up
a
huge
percentage
of
our
great
libraries
holdings
for
example
scholars
estimate
that
the
majority
of
our
film
holdings
are
orphan
for
books
the
estimates
are
similar
not
only
are
these
works
unavailable
commercially
there
is
simply
no
way
to
find
and
contact
the
person
who
could
agree
to
give
permission
to
digitize
the
work
or
make
it
available
in
a
new
form
take
a
conservative
set
of
numbers
subtract
from
our
totals
the
works
that
are
clearly
in
the
public
domain
in
the
united
states
that
is
generally
work
produced
before
that
material
at
least
we
can
use
freely
subtract
too
the
works
that
are
still
available
from
the
copyright
holder
there
we
can
gain
access
if
we
are
willing
to
pay
yet
this
still
leaves
a
huge
proportion
of
and
culture
commercially
unavailable
but
under
copyright
in
the
case
of
books
the
number
is
over
percent
as
i
said
before
with
films
and
music
it
is
harder
to
tell
but
the
percentages
are
still
tragically
high
a
substantial
proportion
of
that
total
is
made
up
of
orphan
works
they
can
not
be
reprinted
or
digitized
even
if
we
were
willing
to
pay
the
owner
to
do
so
and
then
comes
the
internet
right
now
you
can
search
for
those
books
or
films
or
songs
and
have
the
location
of
the
work
instantly
displayed
as
well
as
a
few
details
about
it
and
if
you
live
in
washington
or
near
some
other
great
library
you
can
go
to
a
reading
room
and
if
the
work
can
be
found
and
has
not
been
checked
out
and
has
not
deteriorated
you
can
read
the
books
though
you
probably
will
not
be
able
to
arrange
to
see
the
movies
unless
you
are
an
accredited
film
scholar
i
was
searching
the
library
of
congress
catalogue
online
one
night
tracking
down
a
book
about
politics
and
markets
when
my
son
came
in
to
watch
me
he
was
about
eight
years
old
at
the
time
but
already
a
child
of
the
internet
age
he
asked
what
i
was
doing
and
i
explained
that
i
was
printing
out
the
details
of
the
book
so
that
i
could
try
to
find
it
in
my
own
university
library
why
do
you
read
it
online
he
said
reaching
over
my
shoulder
and
on
the
title
frowning
when
that
merely
led
to
another
information
page
how
do
you
get
to
read
the
actual
book
i
smiled
at
the
assumption
that
all
the
works
of
literature
were
not
merely
in
the
library
of
congress
but
actually
on
the
net
available
to
anyone
with
an
internet
connection
anywhere
in
the
world
so
that
you
could
not
merely
search
for
but
also
read
or
print
some
large
slice
of
the
library
holdings
imagine
what
that
would
be
like
imagine
the
little
underlined
blue
hyperlink
from
each
title
to
my
son
it
made
perfect
sense
the
book
title
was
in
the
catalogue
when
you
clicked
the
link
surely
you
would
get
to
read
it
that
is
what
happened
in
his
experience
when
one
clicked
a
link
why
not
here
it
was
an
old
book
after
all
no
longer
in
print
imagine
being
able
to
read
the
books
hear
the
music
or
watch
the
films
or
at
least
the
ones
that
the
library
of
congress
thought
it
worthwhile
to
digitize
of
course
that
is
ridiculous
i
tried
to
explain
this
to
my
son
i
showed
him
that
there
were
some
works
that
could
be
seen
online
i
took
him
to
the
online
photograph
library
meaning
to
show
him
the
wealth
of
amazing
historical
photographs
instead
i
found
myself
brooding
over
the
lengthy
listing
of
legal
restrictions
on
the
images
and
the
explanation
that
reproduction
of
protected
items
may
require
the
written
permission
of
the
copyright
owners
and
that
in
many
cases
only
indistinct
and
tiny
thumbnail
images
are
displayed
to
those
searching
from
outside
the
library
of
congress
because
of
potential
rights
considerations
the
same
was
true
of
the
scratchy
folk
songs
from
the
twenties
or
the
early
film
holdings
the
material
was
in
the
library
of
course
remarkable
collections
in
some
cases
carefully
preserved
and
sometimes
even
digitized
at
public
expense
yet
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
it
is
available
online
there
is
a
fascinating
set
of
early
films
for
example
most
of
the
material
available
online
comes
from
so
long
ago
that
the
copyright
could
not
possibly
still
be
in
force
but
since
copyright
lasts
for
seventy
years
after
the
death
of
the
author
or
years
if
it
was
a
corporate
work
for
hire
that
could
be
a
very
very
long
time
indeed
long
enough
in
fact
to
keep
off
limits
almost
the
whole
history
of
moving
pictures
and
the
entire
history
of
recorded
music
long
enough
to
lock
up
almost
all
of
culture
but
is
that
not
what
copyright
is
supposed
to
do
to
grant
the
right
to
restrict
access
so
as
to
allow
authors
to
charge
for
the
privilege
of
obtaining
it
yes
indeed
and
this
is
a
very
good
idea
but
as
i
argue
in
this
book
the
goal
of
the
system
ought
to
be
to
give
the
monopoly
only
for
as
long
as
necessary
to
provide
an
incentive
after
that
we
should
let
the
work
fall
into
the
public
domain
where
all
of
us
can
use
it
transform
it
adapt
it
build
on
it
republish
it
as
we
wish
for
most
works
the
owners
expect
to
make
all
the
money
they
are
going
to
recoup
from
the
work
with
five
or
ten
years
of
exclusive
rights
the
rest
of
the
copyright
term
is
of
little
use
to
them
except
as
a
kind
of
lottery
ticket
in
case
the
work
proves
to
be
a
million
perennial
favorite
the
lottery
winner
will
benefit
of
course
if
his
ticket
comes
up
and
if
the
ticket
is
free
who
would
not
take
it
but
the
ticket
is
not
free
to
the
public
they
pay
higher
prices
for
the
works
still
being
commercially
exploited
and
frequently
the
price
of
complete
unavailability
for
the
works
that
are
not
think
of
a
perennial
favorite
harry
potter
say
long
after
rowling
is
dust
we
will
all
be
forbidden
from
making
derivative
works
or
publishing
cheap
editions
or
versions
or
simply
reproducing
it
for
pleasure
i
am
a
great
admirer
of
rowling
work
but
my
guess
is
that
little
extra
incentive
was
provided
by
the
thought
that
her
copyright
will
endure
seventy
rather
than
merely
fifty
years
after
her
death
some
large
costs
are
being
imposed
here
for
a
small
benefit
and
the
costs
fall
even
more
heavily
on
all
the
other
works
which
are
available
nowhere
but
in
some
moldering
library
stacks
to
put
it
another
way
if
copyright
owners
had
to
purchase
each
additional
five
years
of
term
separately
the
same
way
we
buy
warranties
on
our
appliances
the
economically
rational
ones
would
mainly
settle
for
a
fairly
short
period
of
course
there
are
some
works
that
are
still
being
exploited
commercially
long
after
their
publication
date
obviously
the
owners
of
these
works
would
not
want
them
freely
available
online
this
seems
reasonable
enough
though
even
with
those
works
the
copyright
should
expire
eventually
but
remember
in
the
library
of
congress
vast
wonderful
pudding
of
songs
and
pictures
and
films
and
books
and
magazines
and
newspapers
there
is
perhaps
a
handful
of
raisins
worth
of
works
that
anyone
is
making
any
money
from
and
the
vast
majority
of
those
come
from
the
last
ten
years
if
one
goes
back
twenty
years
perhaps
a
raisin
fifty
years
a
slight
raisiny
aroma
we
restrict
access
to
the
whole
pudding
in
order
to
give
the
owners
of
the
raisin
slivers
their
due
but
this
pudding
is
almost
all
of
century
culture
and
we
are
restricting
access
to
it
when
almost
of
all
of
it
could
be
available
if
you
do
not
know
much
about
copyright
you
might
think
that
i
am
exaggerating
after
all
if
no
one
has
any
financial
interest
in
the
works
or
we
do
not
even
know
who
owns
the
copyright
surely
a
library
would
be
free
to
put
those
works
online
does
no
harm
no
foul
apply
in
the
world
of
copyright
in
a
word
no
copyright
is
what
lawyers
call
a
strict
liability
system
this
means
that
it
is
generally
not
a
legal
excuse
to
say
that
you
did
not
believe
you
were
violating
copyright
or
that
you
did
so
by
accident
or
in
the
belief
that
no
one
would
care
and
that
your
actions
benefited
the
public
innocence
and
mistake
do
not
absolve
you
though
they
might
reduce
the
penalties
imposed
since
it
is
so
difficult
to
know
exactly
who
owns
the
copyright
or
copyrights
on
a
work
many
libraries
simply
will
not
reproduce
the
material
or
make
it
available
online
until
they
can
be
sure
the
copyright
has
expired
which
may
mean
waiting
for
over
a
century
they
can
not
afford
to
take
the
risk
what
is
wrong
with
this
picture
copyright
has
done
its
job
and
encouraged
the
creation
of
the
work
but
now
it
acts
as
a
fence
keeping
us
out
and
restricting
access
to
the
work
to
those
who
have
the
time
and
resources
to
trudge
through
the
stacks
of
the
nation
archives
in
some
cases
as
with
film
it
may
simply
make
the
work
completely
unavailable
so
far
i
have
been
talking
as
though
copyright
were
the
only
reason
the
material
is
not
freely
available
online
but
of
course
this
is
not
true
digitizing
costs
money
though
less
every
year
and
there
is
a
lot
of
rubbish
out
there
stuff
no
one
would
ever
want
to
make
available
digitally
though
it
must
be
noted
that
one
man
rubbish
is
another
man
delight
but
that
still
leaves
vast
amounts
of
material
that
we
would
want
and
be
willing
to
pay
to
have
digitized
remember
also
that
if
the
material
were
legally
free
anyone
could
get
in
on
the
act
of
digitizing
it
and
putting
it
up
google
effort
to
scan
the
books
in
major
libraries
is
just
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
but
google
is
being
sued
for
violating
copyright
even
though
it
allows
any
author
to
opt
out
of
its
system
and
even
though
under
the
google
system
you
can
not
click
to
get
the
book
if
it
is
still
under
copyright
merely
a
snippet
a
few
sentences
long
from
the
book
if
you
are
shaking
your
head
as
you
read
this
saying
that
no
one
would
bother
digitizing
most
of
the
material
in
the
archives
look
at
the
internet
and
ask
yourself
where
the
information
came
from
the
last
time
you
did
a
search
was
it
an
official
and
prestigious
institution
a
university
or
a
museum
or
a
government
sometimes
those
are
our
sources
of
information
of
course
but
do
you
not
find
the
majority
of
the
information
you
need
by
wandering
off
into
a
strange
of
sites
amateur
and
professional
commercial
and
not
hobbyist
and
entrepreneur
all
by
internal
referrals
and
search
engine
algorithms
even
if
google
did
not
undertake
the
task
of
digitization
there
would
be
hundreds
thousands
maybe
millions
of
others
who
would
not
with
google
resources
to
be
sure
in
the
process
they
would
create
something
quite
remarkable
the
most
satisfying
proofs
are
existence
proofs
a
platypus
is
an
existence
proof
that
mammals
can
lay
eggs
the
internet
is
an
existence
proof
of
the
remarkable
information
processing
power
of
a
decentralized
network
of
hobbyists
amateurs
universities
businesses
volunteer
groups
professionals
and
retired
experts
and
who
knows
what
else
it
is
a
network
that
produces
useful
information
and
services
frequently
it
does
so
at
no
cost
to
the
user
and
without
anyone
guiding
it
imagine
that
energy
that
decentralized
and
idiosyncratically
dispersed
pattern
of
interests
turned
loose
on
the
cultural
artifacts
of
the
twentieth
century
then
imagine
it
coupled
to
the
efforts
of
the
great
state
archives
and
private
museums
who
themselves
would
be
free
to
do
the
same
thing
think
of
the
people
who
would
work
on
buster
keaton
or
the
literary
classics
of
the
or
the
films
of
the
second
world
war
or
footage
on
the
daily
lives
of
during
segregation
or
the
music
of
the
great
depression
or
theremin
recordings
or
the
best
of
vaudeville
imagine
your
google
search
in
such
a
world
imagine
that
library
of
congress
one
science
fiction
writer
has
taken
a
stab
his
character
utters
the
immortal
line
man
you
get
my
library
of
congress
when
you
pry
my
cold
dead
fingers
off
it
familiar
with
the
effect
of
this
kind
of
train
of
thought
on
his
father
my
son
had
long
since
wandered
off
in
search
of
a
basketball
game
to
watch
but
i
have
to
admit
his
question
was
something
of
an
epiphany
for
me
where
do
you
click
to
get
the
actual
book
the
response
i
get
from
a
lot
of
people
is
that
this
vision
of
the
library
of
congress
is
communism
pure
and
simple
such
people
view
google
attempt
to
digitize
books
as
simple
theft
surely
it
will
destroy
the
incentives
necessary
to
produce
the
next
beach
novel
the
next
academic
monograph
the
next
teen
band
cd
the
next
movie
but
this
mistakes
my
suggestion
imagine
a
very
conservative
system
first
let
us
make
people
demonstrate
that
they
want
a
copyright
by
the
arduous
step
of
actually
writing
the
word
copyright
or
the
little
c
on
the
work
at
the
moment
everyone
gets
a
copyright
as
soon
as
the
work
is
written
down
or
otherwise
fixed
whether
they
want
one
or
not
but
how
long
a
copyright
we
know
that
the
majority
of
works
are
only
valuable
for
five
or
ten
years
let
us
give
copyright
owners
more
than
double
that
say
years
of
exclusive
rights
if
prior
experience
is
any
guide
percent
of
works
will
be
allowed
to
enter
the
public
domain
after
that
period
if
that
is
generous
enough
let
us
say
that
the
small
proportion
of
owners
who
still
find
value
in
their
copyright
at
the
end
of
years
can
extend
their
copyright
for
another
years
works
that
are
not
renewed
fall
immediately
into
the
public
domain
if
you
check
the
register
after
eight
years
and
the
work
has
not
been
renewed
it
is
in
the
public
domain
works
that
are
renewed
get
the
extra
time
now
this
is
a
conservative
suggestion
too
conservative
in
my
view
though
still
better
than
what
we
have
now
is
it
feasible
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
that
it
is
not
this
pretty
much
was
the
law
in
the
united
states
until
my
system
is
a
little
simpler
but
the
broad
strokes
are
the
same
since
that
point
in
two
broad
stages
we
have
moved
away
from
this
system
at
the
very
moment
in
history
when
the
internet
made
it
a
particularly
stupid
idea
to
do
so
how
have
we
changed
the
system
we
have
given
copyrights
to
the
creator
of
any
original
work
as
soon
as
it
is
fixed
so
that
you
reader
are
the
author
of
thousands
of
copyrighted
works
almost
everything
up
on
the
internet
is
copyrighted
even
if
its
creators
do
not
know
that
and
would
prefer
it
to
be
in
the
public
domain
imagine
that
you
want
to
make
a
documentary
and
use
a
film
clip
that
a
student
filmmaker
has
put
up
on
his
home
page
perhaps
you
want
to
adapt
the
nifty
graphics
that
a
high
school
teacher
in
hawaii
created
to
teach
her
calculus
class
thinking
that
with
a
few
changes
you
could
use
the
material
for
your
state
physics
program
perhaps
you
are
a
collage
artist
who
wishes
to
incorporate
images
that
amateur
artists
have
put
online
none
of
the
works
are
marked
by
a
copyright
symbol
certainly
they
are
up
on
the
internet
but
does
that
mean
that
they
are
available
for
reprinting
adaptation
or
incorporation
in
a
new
work
in
each
of
these
cases
you
simply
do
not
know
whether
what
you
are
doing
is
legal
or
not
of
course
you
can
take
the
risk
though
that
becomes
less
advisable
if
you
want
to
share
your
work
with
others
each
broadening
of
the
circle
of
sharing
increases
the
value
to
society
but
also
the
legal
danger
to
you
what
if
you
want
to
put
the
course
materials
on
the
net
or
publish
the
anthology
or
display
the
movie
perhaps
you
can
try
to
persuade
your
publisher
or
employer
or
distributor
to
take
the
risk
perhaps
you
can
track
down
the
authors
of
every
piece
you
wish
to
use
and
puzzle
through
the
way
to
get
a
legal
release
from
them
stating
that
they
give
you
permission
to
use
the
work
they
did
not
even
know
they
had
copyright
over
or
you
can
give
up
whatever
happens
you
waste
time
and
effort
in
trying
to
figure
out
a
way
of
getting
around
a
system
that
is
designed
around
neither
your
needs
nor
the
needs
of
many
of
the
people
whose
work
you
want
to
use
apart
from
doing
away
with
the
need
to
indicate
that
you
want
your
works
to
be
copyrighted
we
have
lengthened
the
copyright
term
we
did
this
without
any
credible
evidence
that
it
was
necessary
to
encourage
innovation
we
have
extended
the
terms
of
living
and
even
of
dead
authors
over
works
that
have
already
been
created
it
is
hard
to
argue
that
this
was
a
necessary
incentive
what
with
the
works
already
existing
and
the
authors
often
being
dead
we
have
done
away
with
the
need
to
renew
the
right
everyone
gets
the
term
of
life
plus
seventy
years
or
years
for
corporate
works
for
hire
all
protected
by
a
strict
liability
system
with
scary
penalties
and
as
i
said
before
we
have
made
all
those
choices
just
when
the
internet
makes
their
costs
particularly
tragic
in
sum
we
have
forgone
the
library
of
congress
i
described
without
even
apparently
realizing
we
were
doing
so
we
have
locked
up
most
of
culture
and
done
it
in
a
particularly
inefficient
and
senseless
way
creating
vast
costs
in
order
to
convey
proportionally
tiny
benefits
and
all
without
much
complaint
from
those
who
normally
object
to
inefficient
government
subsidy
programs
worst
of
all
we
have
turned
the
system
on
its
head
copyright
intended
to
be
the
servant
of
creativity
a
means
of
promoting
access
to
information
is
becoming
an
obstacle
to
both
that
then
is
one
example
of
the
stakes
of
the
debate
over
intellectual
property
policy
unfortunately
the
problem
of
copyright
terms
is
just
one
example
one
instance
of
a
larger
pattern
as
i
will
try
to
show
this
pattern
is
repeated
again
and
again
in
patents
in
trademarks
and
elsewhere
in
copyright
law
this
is
not
an
isolated
glitch
it
is
a
complicated
but
relentless
tendency
that
has
led
to
a
hypertrophy
of
intellectual
property
rights
and
an
assault
on
the
public
domain
in
fact
in
many
cases
the
reality
is
even
worse
there
appears
to
be
a
complete
ignorance
about
the
value
of
the
public
domain
property
opposite
its
outside
is
getting
short
shrift
to
paraphrase
a
song
from
my
youth
how
did
we
get
here
where
should
we
turn
to
understand
the
role
of
intellectual
property
in
the
era
of
the
internet
and
the
decoding
of
the
human
genome
we
could
turn
to
the
cutting
edge
of
technology
or
to
economics
or
information
theory
but
none
of
those
would
be
as
useful
a
starting
place
as
a
letter
that
was
written
about
two
hundred
years
ago
using
a
quill
pen
about
a
subject
far
from
the
digital
world
chapter
thomas
jefferson
writes
a
letter
on
august
thomas
jefferson
took
up
his
pen
to
write
to
isaac
it
was
a
quiet
week
in
correspondence
he
wrote
a
letter
to
madison
about
the
appointment
of
a
tax
assessor
attempted
to
procure
a
government
position
for
an
acquaintance
produced
a
fascinating
and
lengthy
series
of
comments
on
a
new
rudiments
of
english
grammar
discussed
the
orthography
of
nouns
ending
in
y
accepted
the
necessary
delay
in
the
publication
of
a
study
on
the
anatomy
of
mammoth
bones
completed
a
brief
biography
of
governor
lewis
and
in
general
confined
himself
narrowly
in
subject
but
on
the
of
august
jefferson
mind
was
on
intellectual
property
and
most
specifically
patents
jefferson
writing
is
as
usual
apparently
effortless
some
find
his
penmanship
a
little
hard
to
decipher
to
me
used
to
plowing
through
the
frenzied
chicken
tracks
that
law
students
produce
during
exams
it
seems
perfectly
clear
if
handwriting
truly
showed
the
architecture
of
the
soul
then
would
conjure
up
monticello
or
the
university
of
virginia
there
are
a
few
revisions
and
interlineations
a
couple
of
words
squeezed
in
with
a
caret
at
the
bottom
of
the
line
but
for
the
most
part
the
lines
of
handwriting
simply
roll
on
and
on
the
fugitive
fermentation
of
an
individual
brain
to
quote
a
phrase
from
the
letter
caught
in
vellum
and
ink
though
that
brain
has
been
dust
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
i
love
libraries
i
love
the
mushroom
smell
of
gently
rotting
paper
the
flaky
crackle
of
manuscripts
and
the
surprise
of
matching
style
of
handwriting
with
style
of
thought
today
though
i
am
viewing
his
letter
over
the
internet
on
a
computer
screen
you
can
too
the
details
are
at
the
back
of
the
book
i
think
jefferson
would
have
been
fascinated
by
the
internet
after
all
this
was
the
man
whose
library
became
the
library
of
who
exemplifies
the
notion
of
the
brilliant
dabbler
in
a
hundred
fields
whose
own
book
collection
was
clearly
a
vital
and
much
consulted
part
of
his
daily
existence
and
whose
vision
of
politics
celebrates
the
power
of
an
informed
citizenry
admittedly
the
massive
conflicts
between
announced
principles
and
his
actions
on
the
issue
of
slavery
have
led
some
though
not
me
to
doubt
that
there
is
any
sincerity
or
moral
instruction
to
be
found
in
his
but
even
those
who
find
him
a
sham
can
hardly
fail
to
see
the
continual
and
obvious
joy
he
felt
about
knowledge
and
its
spread
in
the
letter
to
isaac
mcpherson
a
letter
that
has
become
very
famous
in
the
world
of
the
this
joy
becomes
manifest
the
initial
subject
of
the
correspondence
seems
far
from
the
online
world
mcpherson
wrote
to
jefferson
about
elevators
conveyers
and
specifically
he
wanted
to
know
jefferson
opinion
of
a
patent
that
had
been
issued
to
oliver
evans
jefferson
devotes
a
paragraph
to
a
recent
retrospective
extension
of
patent
rights
he
disapproves
and
then
turns
to
evans
elevators
patents
then
as
now
were
only
supposed
to
be
given
for
inventions
that
were
novel
nonobvious
and
useful
jefferson
had
considerable
doubt
whether
evans
device
essentially
a
revolving
string
of
buckets
used
to
move
grain
actually
counted
as
an
invention
the
question
then
whether
such
a
string
of
buckets
was
invented
first
by
oliver
evans
is
a
mere
question
of
fact
in
mathematical
history
now
turning
to
such
books
only
as
i
happen
to
possess
i
find
abundant
proof
that
this
simple
machinery
has
been
in
use
from
time
immemorial
jefferson
cites
from
his
library
example
after
example
of
references
to
the
persian
wheel
a
string
of
buckets
to
move
water
the
display
of
scholarship
is
effortless
and
without
artifice
if
the
device
existed
to
move
water
he
declares
evans
can
hardly
patent
it
to
move
grain
if
one
person
invents
a
knife
convenient
for
pointing
our
pens
another
can
not
have
a
patent
right
for
the
same
knife
to
point
our
pencils
a
compass
was
invented
for
navigating
the
sea
another
could
not
have
a
patent
right
for
using
it
to
survey
land
so
far
as
we
can
tell
this
was
the
only
part
of
the
letter
that
interested
mcpherson
later
correspondence
indicates
that
he
had
a
pamphlet
printed
questioning
the
but
while
it
is
impressive
to
see
jefferson
easy
command
of
historical
evidence
or
his
grasp
of
the
importance
of
limiting
the
subject
matter
scope
and
duration
of
patents
these
qualities
alone
would
not
have
given
the
letter
the
fame
it
now
has
it
is
when
jefferson
turns
to
the
idea
of
intellectual
property
itself
that
the
letter
becomes
more
than
a
historical
curiosity
in
a
couple
of
pages
quickly
jotted
down
on
a
humid
august
day
in
he
frames
the
issue
as
well
as
anyone
has
since
he
starts
by
dismissing
the
idea
that
inventors
have
a
natural
and
exclusive
right
to
their
inventions
and
not
merely
for
their
own
lives
but
inheritable
to
their
heirs
in
lines
that
will
sound
strange
to
those
who
assume
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
property
absolutists
jefferson
argues
that
stable
ownership
of
even
tangible
property
is
a
gift
of
social
law
intellectual
property
then
has
still
less
of
a
claim
to
some
permanent
absolute
and
natural
status
w
hile
it
is
a
moot
question
whether
the
origin
of
any
kind
of
property
is
derived
from
nature
at
all
it
would
be
singular
to
admit
a
natural
and
even
an
hereditary
right
to
inventors
it
is
agreed
by
those
who
have
seriously
considered
the
subject
that
no
individual
has
of
natural
right
a
separate
property
in
an
acre
of
land
for
instance
by
an
universal
law
indeed
whatever
whether
fixed
or
movable
belongs
to
all
men
equally
and
in
common
is
the
property
for
the
moment
of
him
who
occupies
it
but
when
he
relinquishes
the
occupation
the
property
goes
with
it
stable
ownership
is
the
gift
of
social
law
and
is
given
late
in
the
progress
of
society
it
would
be
curious
then
if
an
idea
the
fugitive
fermentation
of
an
individual
brain
could
of
natural
right
be
claimed
in
exclusive
and
stable
jefferson
point
here
may
seem
obscure
to
us
we
are
not
used
to
starting
every
argument
from
first
principles
but
it
is
in
fact
quite
simple
it
is
society
that
creates
property
rights
that
go
beyond
mere
occupancy
it
does
so
for
several
reasons
reasons
of
both
practicality
and
natural
justice
elsewhere
in
his
writings
jefferson
expands
on
this
point
at
greater
length
one
of
those
reasons
has
to
do
with
the
difficulty
perhaps
even
the
impossibility
of
two
different
people
having
full
and
unfettered
ownership
of
the
same
piece
of
property
simultaneously
another
linked
reason
comes
from
the
practicality
of
excluding
others
from
our
property
so
that
we
can
exploit
it
secure
from
the
plunder
or
sloth
of
others
the
economists
you
encountered
in
chapter
have
with
their
usual
linguistic
felicity
coined
the
terms
rivalrous
and
excludable
to
describe
these
characteristics
with
rivalrous
property
one
person
use
precludes
another
if
i
drink
the
milk
you
can
not
excludable
property
is
logically
enough
property
from
which
others
can
easily
be
excluded
or
kept
out
but
ideas
seem
to
have
neither
of
these
characteristics
if
nature
has
made
any
one
thing
less
susceptible
than
all
others
of
exclusive
property
it
is
the
action
of
the
thinking
power
called
an
idea
which
an
individual
may
exclusively
possess
as
he
keeps
it
to
himself
but
the
moment
it
is
divulged
it
forces
itself
into
the
possession
of
every
one
and
the
receiver
can
not
dispossess
himself
of
it
its
peculiar
character
too
is
that
no
one
possess
the
less
because
every
other
possess
the
whole
of
it
he
who
receives
an
idea
from
me
receives
instruction
himself
without
lessening
mine
as
he
who
lights
his
taper
at
mine
receives
light
without
darkening
me
that
ideas
should
freely
spread
from
one
to
another
over
the
globe
for
the
moral
and
mutual
instruction
of
man
and
improvement
of
his
condition
seems
to
have
been
peculiarly
and
benevolently
designed
by
nature
when
she
made
them
like
fire
expansible
over
all
space
without
lessening
their
density
in
any
point
and
like
the
air
in
which
we
breathe
move
and
have
our
physical
being
incapable
of
confinement
or
exclusive
appropriation
inventions
then
can
not
in
nature
be
a
subject
of
those
who
quote
the
passage
sometimes
stop
here
which
is
a
shame
because
it
leaves
the
impression
that
jefferson
was
unequivocally
against
intellectual
property
rights
but
that
would
be
a
considerable
overstatement
when
he
says
that
inventions
can
never
be
the
subject
of
property
he
means
a
permanent
and
exclusive
property
right
which
as
a
matter
of
natural
right
no
just
government
could
abridge
however
inventions
could
be
covered
by
temporary
monopolies
instituted
for
the
common
good
in
the
lines
immediately
following
the
popularly
quoted
excerpt
jefferson
goes
on
society
may
give
an
exclusive
right
to
the
profits
arising
from
inventions
as
an
encouragement
to
men
to
pursue
ideas
which
may
produce
utility
but
this
may
or
may
not
be
done
according
to
the
will
and
convenience
of
the
society
without
claim
or
complaint
from
any
body
accordingly
it
is
a
fact
as
far
as
i
am
informed
that
england
was
until
we
copied
her
the
only
country
on
earth
which
ever
by
a
general
law
gave
a
legal
right
to
the
exclusive
use
of
an
idea
in
some
other
countries
it
is
sometimes
done
in
a
great
case
and
by
a
special
and
personal
act
but
generally
speaking
other
nations
have
thought
that
these
monopolies
produce
more
embarrassment
than
advantage
to
society
and
it
may
be
observed
that
the
nations
which
refuse
monopolies
of
invention
are
as
fruitful
as
england
in
new
and
useful
jefferson
message
was
a
skeptical
recognition
that
intellectual
property
rights
might
be
necessary
a
careful
explanation
that
they
should
not
be
treated
as
natural
rights
and
a
warning
of
the
monopolistic
dangers
that
they
pose
he
immediately
goes
on
to
say
something
else
something
that
is
if
anything
more
true
in
the
world
of
patents
on
internet
business
methods
and
gene
sequences
than
it
was
in
the
world
of
conveyers
and
considering
the
exclusive
right
to
invention
as
given
not
of
natural
right
but
for
the
benefit
of
society
i
know
well
the
difficulty
of
drawing
a
line
between
the
things
which
are
worth
to
the
public
the
embarrassment
of
an
exclusive
patent
and
those
which
are
so
jefferson
gives
us
a
classic
set
of
cautions
cautions
that
we
should
be
required
to
repeat
as
police
officers
repeat
the
miranda
warning
to
a
suspect
in
this
case
they
should
be
repeated
before
we
rush
off
into
the
world
of
intellectual
property
policy
rather
than
before
we
talk
to
the
police
without
our
lawyers
present
the
jefferson
warning
like
the
miranda
warning
the
jefferson
warning
has
a
number
of
important
parts
first
the
stuff
we
cover
with
intellectual
property
rights
has
certain
vital
differences
from
the
stuff
we
cover
with
tangible
property
rights
partly
because
of
those
differences
jefferson
like
most
of
his
successors
in
the
united
states
does
not
see
intellectual
property
as
a
claim
of
natural
right
based
on
expended
labor
instead
it
is
a
temporary
monopoly
given
to
encourage
further
innovation
second
there
is
no
entitlement
to
have
an
intellectual
property
right
such
rights
may
or
may
not
be
given
as
a
matter
of
social
will
and
convenience
without
claim
or
complaint
from
any
body
third
intellectual
property
rights
are
not
and
should
not
be
permanent
in
fact
they
should
be
tightly
limited
in
time
and
should
not
last
a
day
longer
than
necessary
to
encourage
the
innovation
in
the
first
place
fourth
a
linked
point
they
have
considerable
monopolistic
dangers
they
may
well
produce
more
embarrassment
than
advantage
in
fact
since
intellectual
property
rights
potentially
restrain
the
benevolent
tendency
of
ideas
to
freely
spread
from
one
to
another
over
the
globe
for
the
moral
and
mutual
instruction
of
man
they
may
in
some
cases
actually
hinder
rather
than
encourage
innovation
fifth
deciding
whether
to
have
an
intellectual
property
system
is
only
the
first
choice
in
a
long
even
if
one
believes
that
intellectual
property
is
a
good
idea
which
i
firmly
do
one
will
still
have
the
hard
job
of
saying
which
types
of
innovation
or
information
are
worth
to
the
public
the
embarrassment
of
an
exclusive
right
and
of
drawing
the
limits
of
that
right
this
task
turns
out
to
be
very
difficult
without
the
cautions
that
jefferson
gave
us
it
is
impossible
to
do
it
well
jefferson
message
was
famously
echoed
and
amplified
thirty
years
later
in
britain
by
thomas
babington
macaulay
speeches
to
the
house
of
commons
in
on
the
subject
of
copyright
term
extension
still
express
better
than
anything
else
the
position
that
intellectual
property
rights
are
necessary
evils
which
must
be
carefully
circumscribed
by
law
in
order
for
the
supply
of
valuable
books
to
be
maintained
authors
must
be
remunerated
for
their
literary
labour
and
there
are
only
two
ways
in
which
they
can
be
remunerated
one
of
those
ways
is
patronage
the
other
is
copyright
patronage
is
rejected
out
of
hand
i
can
conceive
no
system
more
fatal
to
the
integrity
and
independence
of
literary
men
than
one
under
which
they
should
be
taught
to
look
for
their
daily
bread
to
the
favour
of
ministers
and
nobles
we
have
then
only
one
resource
left
we
must
betake
ourselves
to
copyright
be
the
inconveniences
of
copyright
what
they
may
those
inconveniences
in
truth
are
neither
few
nor
small
copyright
is
monopoly
and
produces
all
the
effects
which
the
general
voice
of
mankind
attributes
to
monopoly
i
believe
sir
that
i
may
safely
take
it
for
granted
that
the
effect
of
monopoly
generally
is
to
make
articles
scarce
to
make
them
dear
and
to
make
them
bad
and
i
may
with
equal
safety
challenge
my
honorable
friend
to
find
out
any
distinction
between
copyright
and
other
privileges
of
the
same
kind
any
reason
why
a
monopoly
of
books
should
produce
an
effect
directly
the
reverse
of
that
which
was
produced
by
the
east
india
company
monopoly
of
tea
or
by
lord
essex
monopoly
of
sweet
wines
thus
then
stands
the
case
it
is
good
that
authors
should
be
remunerated
and
the
least
exceptionable
way
of
remunerating
them
is
by
a
monopoly
yet
monopoly
is
an
evil
for
the
sake
of
the
good
we
must
submit
to
the
evil
but
the
evil
ought
not
to
last
a
day
longer
than
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
notice
that
it
is
the
monopolistic
quality
of
intellectual
property
that
really
disturbs
macaulay
his
was
a
generation
of
thinkers
for
whom
the
negative
effect
of
monopolies
of
any
kind
and
monopolies
in
particular
was
axiomatic
he
becomes
almost
contemptuous
when
one
of
the
supporters
of
copyright
extension
declared
that
it
was
merely
a
theory
that
monopoly
makes
things
expensive
macaulay
agrees
tongue
in
cheek
it
is
a
theory
in
the
same
sense
in
which
it
is
a
theory
that
day
and
night
follow
each
other
that
lead
is
heavier
than
water
that
bread
nourishes
that
arsenic
poisons
that
alcohol
intoxicates
these
words
from
jefferson
and
macaulay
encapsulate
an
and
skepticism
about
intellectual
property
a
skepticism
that
is
widely
but
not
universally
believed
to
have
played
an
important
role
in
shaping
the
history
of
intellectual
property
in
both
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
certainly
the
supreme
court
has
offered
support
for
that
and
with
one
significant
recent
historians
of
intellectual
property
have
jefferson
himself
had
believed
that
the
constitution
should
have
definite
limits
on
both
the
term
and
the
scope
of
intellectual
property
james
madison
stressed
the
costs
of
any
intellectual
property
right
and
the
need
to
limit
its
term
and
to
allow
the
government
to
end
the
monopoly
by
compulsory
purchase
if
adam
smith
expressed
similar
views
monopolies
that
carry
on
long
after
they
were
needed
to
encourage
some
socially
beneficial
activity
he
said
tax
every
other
citizen
very
absurdly
in
two
different
ways
first
by
the
high
price
of
goods
which
in
the
case
of
a
free
trade
they
could
buy
much
cheaper
and
secondly
by
their
total
exclusion
from
a
branch
of
business
which
it
might
be
both
convenient
and
profitable
for
many
of
them
to
carry
on
it
is
important
to
note
though
that
the
and
writers
i
have
quoted
were
not
against
intellectual
property
all
of
them
jefferson
madison
smith
and
macaulay
could
see
good
reason
why
intellectual
property
rights
should
be
granted
they
simply
insisted
on
weighing
the
costs
and
benefits
of
a
new
right
each
expansion
of
scope
each
lengthening
of
the
copyright
term
here
is
macaulay
again
waxing
eloquently
sarcastic
about
the
costs
and
benefits
of
extending
the
copyright
term
so
that
it
would
last
many
years
after
the
author
death
i
will
take
an
example
johnson
died
years
ago
if
the
law
were
what
my
honourable
and
learned
friend
wishes
to
make
it
somebody
would
now
have
the
monopoly
of
johnson
works
who
that
somebody
would
be
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
we
may
venture
to
guess
i
guess
then
that
it
would
have
been
some
bookseller
who
was
the
assign
of
another
bookseller
who
was
the
grandson
of
a
third
bookseller
who
had
bought
the
copyright
from
black
frank
the
doctor
servant
and
residuary
legatee
in
or
now
would
the
knowledge
that
this
copyright
would
exist
in
have
been
a
source
of
gratification
to
johnson
would
it
have
stimulated
his
exertions
would
it
have
once
drawn
him
out
of
his
bed
before
noon
would
it
have
once
cheered
him
under
a
fit
of
the
spleen
would
it
have
induced
him
to
give
us
one
more
allegory
one
more
life
of
a
poet
one
more
imitation
of
juvenal
i
firmly
believe
not
i
firmly
believe
that
a
hundred
years
ago
when
he
was
writing
our
debates
for
the
gentleman
magazine
he
would
very
much
rather
have
had
twopence
to
buy
a
plate
of
shin
of
beef
at
a
cook
shop
again
i
am
struck
by
how
seamlessly
macaulay
coupled
beautiful
evocative
writing
and
careful
analytic
argument
admittedly
he
was
remarkable
even
in
his
own
time
but
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
contemporary
speechwriter
let
alone
a
politician
coming
up
with
johnson
cheered
under
a
fit
of
the
spleen
or
buying
a
plate
of
shin
of
beef
at
a
cook
shop
underground
almost
as
hard
as
it
is
to
imagine
any
of
them
engaging
in
jefferson
correspondence
about
mammoth
bones
orthography
and
the
practicalities
of
the
nautical
torpedo
but
i
digress
macaulay
is
not
against
using
a
lengthened
copyright
term
to
give
an
extra
reward
to
writers
even
if
this
would
dramatically
raise
the
price
of
books
what
he
objects
to
is
dramatically
raising
the
price
of
books
written
by
authors
in
a
way
that
benefits
the
authors
hardly
at
all
considered
as
a
reward
to
him
the
difference
between
a
twenty
years
and
a
sixty
years
term
of
posthumous
copyright
would
have
been
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
but
is
the
difference
nothing
to
us
i
can
buy
rasselas
for
sixpence
i
might
have
had
to
give
five
shillings
for
it
i
can
buy
the
dictionary
the
entire
genuine
dictionary
for
two
guineas
perhaps
for
less
i
might
have
had
to
give
five
or
six
guineas
for
it
do
i
grudge
this
to
a
man
like
johnson
not
at
all
show
me
that
the
prospect
of
this
boon
roused
him
to
any
vigorous
effort
or
sustained
his
spirits
under
depressing
circumstances
and
i
am
quite
willing
to
pay
the
price
of
such
an
object
heavy
as
that
price
is
but
what
i
do
complain
of
is
that
my
circumstances
are
to
be
worse
and
johnson
none
the
better
that
i
am
to
give
five
pounds
for
what
to
him
was
not
worth
a
though
macaulay
won
the
debate
over
copyright
term
extension
it
is
worth
noting
here
that
his
opponents
triumphed
in
the
end
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
last
chapter
the
copyright
term
in
most
of
europe
and
in
the
united
states
now
lasts
for
the
life
of
the
author
and
an
additional
seventy
years
afterward
ten
years
more
than
the
proposal
which
made
macaulay
so
indignant
in
the
united
states
corporate
owners
of
get
five
the
supreme
court
recently
heard
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
law
which
expanded
the
term
of
copyrights
by
twenty
years
to
reach
this
remarkable
full
disclosure
i
helped
prepare
an
amicus
brief
in
that
case
this
law
the
sonny
bono
copyright
term
extension
act
also
extended
existing
copyrights
over
works
which
had
already
been
as
i
observed
earlier
this
is
particularly
remarkable
if
the
idea
is
to
give
an
incentive
to
create
obviously
the
authors
of
existing
works
were
given
sufficient
incentive
to
create
we
know
that
because
they
did
why
do
we
need
to
give
the
people
who
now
hold
their
copyrights
another
twenty
years
of
monopoly
this
is
all
cost
and
no
benefit
macaulay
would
have
been
furious
when
the
supreme
court
heard
the
case
it
was
presented
with
a
remarkable
brief
from
seventeen
economists
several
of
them
nobel
the
economists
made
exactly
macaulay
argument
though
in
less
graceful
language
they
pointed
out
that
copyright
extension
imposed
enormous
costs
on
the
public
and
yet
conveyed
tiny
advantages
if
any
to
the
creator
such
an
extension
particularly
over
works
that
had
already
been
written
hardly
fit
the
limits
of
congress
power
under
the
constitution
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
by
securing
for
limited
times
to
authors
and
inventors
the
exclusive
right
to
their
respective
writings
and
discoveries
macaulay
doubted
that
these
enormously
long
terms
would
encourage
the
living
surely
they
would
do
little
to
encourage
the
dead
while
imposing
considerable
costs
of
access
on
the
living
thus
they
could
hardly
be
said
to
promote
the
progress
of
knowledge
as
the
constitution
requires
the
court
was
unmoved
by
this
and
other
arguments
it
upheld
the
law
i
will
return
to
its
decision
at
the
end
of
the
book
the
intellectual
property
skeptics
had
other
concerns
macaulay
was
particularly
worried
about
the
power
that
went
with
a
transferable
and
inheritable
monopoly
it
is
not
only
that
the
effect
of
monopoly
is
to
make
articles
scarce
to
make
them
dear
and
to
make
them
bad
macaulay
also
pointed
out
that
those
who
controlled
the
monopoly
particularly
after
the
death
of
the
original
author
might
be
given
too
great
a
control
over
our
collective
culture
censorious
heirs
or
purchasers
of
the
copyright
might
prevent
the
reprinting
of
a
great
work
because
they
disagreed
with
its
we
might
lose
the
works
of
fielding
or
gibbon
because
a
legatee
found
them
distasteful
and
used
the
power
of
the
copyright
to
suppress
them
this
is
no
mere
fantasy
macaulay
tells
us
after
praising
the
novels
of
samuel
richardson
in
terms
that
to
modern
eyes
seem
a
little
fervid
no
writings
those
of
shakespeare
excepted
show
more
profound
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
macaulay
recounts
the
story
of
richardson
grandson
a
clergyman
in
the
city
of
london
though
a
most
upright
and
excellent
man
the
grandson
had
conceived
a
strong
prejudice
against
works
of
fiction
thought
all
not
only
frivolous
but
sinful
and
had
never
thought
it
right
to
read
one
of
his
books
extended
copyright
terms
might
hand
over
the
copyright
to
such
a
man
the
public
would
lose
not
because
they
had
to
pay
exorbitant
prices
that
denied
some
access
to
the
work
but
because
the
work
would
be
altogether
suppressed
novels
pamela
clarissa
harlowe
and
so
on
are
now
the
preserve
of
the
classroom
rather
than
the
drawing
room
so
this
might
not
seem
like
much
of
a
loss
but
macaulay
next
example
is
not
so
easy
to
dismiss
one
of
the
most
instructive
interesting
and
delightful
books
in
our
language
is
boswell
life
of
johnson
now
it
is
well
known
that
boswell
eldest
son
considered
this
book
considered
the
whole
relation
of
boswell
to
johnson
as
a
blot
in
the
escutcheon
of
the
family
he
thought
not
perhaps
altogether
without
reason
that
his
father
had
exhibited
himself
in
a
ludicrous
and
degrading
light
and
thus
he
became
so
sore
and
irritable
that
at
last
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
life
of
johnson
mentioned
suppose
that
the
law
had
been
what
my
honourable
and
learned
friend
wishes
to
make
it
suppose
that
the
copyright
of
boswell
life
of
johnson
had
belonged
as
it
well
might
during
sixty
years
to
boswell
eldest
son
what
would
have
been
the
consequence
an
unadulterated
copy
of
the
finest
biographical
work
in
the
world
would
have
been
as
scarce
as
the
first
edition
of
camden
from
more
recent
examples
we
can
see
that
outright
suppression
is
not
the
only
thing
to
fear
the
authors
heirs
or
the
corporations
which
have
purchased
their
rights
may
keep
policing
the
boundaries
of
the
work
long
after
the
original
author
is
dead
in
alice
randall
published
the
wind
done
gone
as
its
title
might
indicate
the
wind
done
gone
was
a
page
critique
of
and
reaction
to
the
world
of
gone
with
the
wind
by
margaret
most
crucially
perhaps
it
was
a
version
of
gone
with
the
wind
told
from
the
slaves
point
of
view
suddenly
the
actions
of
rhett
r
scarlett
other
and
an
obviously
gay
ashley
dreamy
gentleman
come
into
new
perspective
through
the
eyes
of
scarlett
mulatto
sister
mitchell
estate
wanted
to
prevent
publication
of
the
book
at
first
they
were
as
yochai
benkler
puts
it
alice
randall
an
african
american
woman
was
ordered
by
a
government
official
not
to
publish
her
criticism
of
the
romanticization
of
the
old
south
at
least
not
in
the
words
she
wanted
to
use
the
official
was
not
one
of
the
many
in
congress
and
the
administration
who
share
the
romantic
view
of
the
confederacy
it
was
a
federal
judge
in
atlanta
who
told
randall
that
she
could
not
write
her
critique
in
the
words
she
wanted
to
use
a
judge
enforcing
copyright
they
killed
miss
scarlett
the
astonished
trial
judge
said
after
reading
randall
book
my
colleague
jennifer
jenkins
one
of
the
lawyers
in
the
case
recounts
that
the
judge
saw
the
case
in
relentlessly
physical
terms
seeing
the
parody
as
a
bulldozer
and
gone
with
the
wind
as
a
walled
country
estate
into
which
the
bulldozer
had
violently
trespassed
he
was
consequently
unimpressed
with
the
claim
that
this
bulldozer
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
eventually
the
court
of
appeals
overturned
the
district
court
years
after
margaret
mitchell
death
it
was
a
hotly
debated
point
how
much
leeway
copyright
gave
to
others
to
comment
upon
critique
embellish
upon
and
parody
the
cultural
icon
she
had
conjured
up
a
natural
right
to
some
people
my
argument
so
far
and
jefferson
and
macaulay
will
seem
to
miss
the
point
they
see
intellectual
property
rights
not
as
an
incentive
a
method
of
encouraging
the
production
and
distribution
of
innovation
but
as
a
natural
or
moral
right
my
book
is
mine
because
i
wrote
it
not
because
society
or
the
law
gives
me
some
period
of
exclusivity
over
allowing
the
copying
of
its
contents
my
invention
is
mine
because
it
came
from
my
brain
not
because
the
law
declares
a
monopoly
over
its
production
or
distribution
my
logo
is
mine
because
i
worked
hard
on
it
not
because
the
state
grants
me
a
trademark
in
order
to
lower
search
costs
and
prevent
consumer
confusion
one
answer
is
simply
to
say
in
the
united
states
the
framers
of
the
constitution
the
legislature
and
the
courts
have
chosen
to
arrange
things
otherwise
in
copyright
patent
and
trademark
law
despite
occasional
deviations
they
have
embraced
the
utilitarian
view
instead
broadly
speaking
that
answer
is
it
also
holds
to
a
lesser
extent
in
britain
even
in
the
droits
countries
which
have
a
markedly
different
copyright
law
regime
it
largely
holds
for
their
patent
and
trademark
law
systems
and
utilitarian
strands
suffuse
even
the
sacred
rights
of
authors
so
on
a
national
level
we
have
rejected
or
dramatically
limited
the
natural
rights
view
and
on
an
international
level
we
have
rejected
it
in
industrial
property
patent
and
trademark
and
modified
it
in
copyright
i
think
this
answer
is
correct
and
important
but
we
have
an
obligation
to
go
further
partly
that
is
because
intuitions
about
ownership
coming
naturally
with
labor
or
discovery
continue
to
influence
the
law
partly
it
is
because
those
moral
intuitions
are
important
and
appealing
partly
it
is
because
we
might
wish
to
modify
or
criticize
our
current
system
using
the
views
of
the
framers
or
current
law
to
preempt
discussion
is
unsatisfactory
even
though
those
views
are
of
particular
importance
for
the
legal
policy
decisions
we
face
in
the
short
run
the
issues
on
which
much
of
my
argument
is
concentrated
there
are
varying
stated
grounds
for
natural
or
moral
rights
in
intellectual
creations
some
people
may
think
the
book
is
mine
because
i
worked
on
it
a
lockean
conception
where
i
mix
my
sweat
with
these
words
and
receive
a
property
right
in
the
process
for
all
its
attractions
there
are
considerable
difficulties
with
such
a
view
even
within
the
world
of
tangible
property
locke
theory
is
more
complicated
than
a
simple
equation
of
labor
with
property
right
jefferson
account
of
property
is
actually
closer
to
locke
than
many
would
realize
when
jefferson
points
out
the
difficulty
in
justifying
a
natural
right
even
in
an
acre
of
land
let
alone
a
book
his
premises
are
not
radically
different
from
locke
the
same
is
true
when
jefferson
says
that
s
table
ownership
is
the
gift
of
social
law
and
is
given
late
in
the
progress
of
society
even
if
natural
right
does
create
the
ground
for
the
property
claim
it
is
social
law
that
shapes
its
contours
and
guarantees
its
stability
jefferson
of
course
thought
that
was
particularly
true
for
intellectual
property
rights
in
that
context
he
felt
the
natural
rights
argument
was
much
weaker
and
the
need
for
socially
defined
purposive
contours
and
limitations
stronger
locke
own
views
on
what
we
would
think
of
as
copyright
are
hard
to
determine
we
do
know
that
he
had
a
strong
antipathy
to
monopolies
particularly
those
affecting
expression
he
believed
for
example
that
giving
publishers
monopolies
over
great
public
domain
books
caused
a
disastrous
fall
in
quality
instead
he
argued
such
books
should
be
open
for
all
to
compete
to
produce
the
best
edition
of
course
he
was
writing
in
the
context
of
monopolistic
printing
privileges
to
which
he
was
strongly
opposed
rather
than
of
individual
authorial
rights
yet
he
went
further
and
suggested
that
even
for
contemporary
works
after
a
particular
time
in
print
say
fifty
years
books
could
be
printed
by
anyone
i
demand
whether
if
another
act
for
printing
should
be
made
it
be
not
reasonable
that
nobody
should
have
any
peculiar
right
in
any
book
which
has
been
in
print
fifty
years
but
any
one
as
well
as
another
might
have
liberty
to
print
it
for
by
such
titles
as
these
which
lie
dormant
and
hinder
others
many
good
books
come
quite
to
be
this
sounds
like
a
strongly
utilitarian
argument
rather
than
one
based
on
labor
and
natural
right
of
course
we
are
not
bound
by
what
locke
or
jefferson
thought
still
it
is
striking
to
see
the
turn
to
a
utilitarian
conception
from
both
of
them
the
lockean
tradition
is
not
the
only
one
of
course
others
believe
that
the
property
right
stems
from
the
unique
personality
of
each
individual
the
configurations
of
your
individual
genius
made
manifest
in
the
lines
of
your
sonnet
some
limit
the
natural
right
to
literary
and
expressive
work
can
a
mousetrap
or
a
drug
molecule
express
the
riddle
and
wonder
of
the
human
spirit
whatever
their
moral
basis
or
their
ambit
the
common
ground
between
these
positions
is
the
belief
in
a
rationale
for
intellectual
property
rights
beyond
the
utilitarian
concerns
of
jefferson
or
macaulay
the
norms
embodied
in
the
moral
rights
or
natural
rights
tradition
are
deeply
attractive
at
least
to
me
many
of
us
feel
a
special
connection
to
our
expressive
creations
even
the
humble
ones
such
as
a
term
paper
or
a
birthday
poem
it
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
central
moral
rights
in
the
french
droits
or
author
rights
tradition
resonate
so
strongly
with
us
the
entitlement
of
an
author
to
be
correctly
attributed
to
have
some
control
over
the
integrity
of
his
work
seems
important
regardless
of
its
utilitarian
yet
even
as
we
find
this
claim
attractive
we
become
aware
of
the
need
to
find
limiting
principles
to
it
it
gives
us
pause
to
think
that
margaret
mitchell
or
her
heirs
could
forbid
someone
parodying
her
work
are
there
no
limitations
when
other
forms
of
authorship
such
as
computer
programs
are
brought
into
copyright
domain
does
the
power
of
the
moral
right
decrease
while
the
need
to
limit
its
scope
intensifies
then
there
is
the
question
of
length
how
long
is
a
natural
right
in
expression
or
invention
supposed
to
last
it
seems
absurd
to
imagine
that
shakespeare
or
mozart
heirs
or
those
who
had
bought
their
copyrights
would
still
be
controlling
the
performance
reproduction
and
interpretation
of
their
works
hundreds
of
years
after
their
death
if
the
rights
are
truly
formed
for
a
nonutilitarian
purpose
after
all
why
should
they
expire
the
person
who
first
acquires
property
rights
in
land
by
work
or
conquest
passes
those
rights
down
to
heirs
and
buyers
with
the
chain
of
transmission
reaching
to
the
present
day
should
copyright
follow
suit
even
in
france
the
home
of
the
strongest
form
of
the
droits
and
of
the
moral
rights
tradition
the
answer
to
this
question
was
in
the
negative
we
owe
a
large
part
of
the
literary
moral
rights
tradition
to
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
french
revolution
in
france
before
the
revolution
as
in
england
before
the
statute
of
anne
the
first
true
copyright
legislation
the
regulation
of
publishing
was
through
a
set
of
privileges
given
to
printers
not
rights
given
to
authors
publishers
would
have
a
enforced
monopoly
over
certain
titles
their
right
was
against
competing
publishers
printing
the
list
of
titles
over
which
they
had
the
privilege
the
revolution
abolished
these
privileges
and
at
first
put
nothing
in
their
place
on
the
other
hand
as
carla
hesse
fascinating
work
reveals
there
was
intermittent
interference
by
the
prefecture
of
police
with
those
who
copied
most
flagrantly
one
such
publisher
was
sternly
instructed
by
the
police
in
these
terms
a
ccording
to
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
liberty
means
only
the
freedom
to
do
what
does
not
harm
others
and
that
it
harms
others
to
appropriate
the
work
of
an
author
because
it
is
an
infringement
of
the
sacred
right
of
property
and
that
such
an
enterprise
if
it
were
to
remain
unpunished
would
deprive
citizens
of
the
instruction
they
await
from
celebrated
authors
like
bernardin
de
pierre
because
no
author
would
want
to
consecrate
his
labors
to
the
instruction
of
his
age
if
piracy
were
ever
note
the
interesting
mixture
of
the
language
of
the
sacred
rights
of
property
and
the
strong
utilitarian
justification
which
cites
effects
on
future
literary
production
and
the
instruction
of
citizens
more
expansive
conceptions
of
the
rights
of
authors
and
particularly
of
publishers
were
also
offered
even
before
the
revolution
publishers
had
been
making
the
arguments
that
their
privileges
were
a
form
of
property
rights
and
had
the
very
good
sense
to
hire
the
young
diderot
to
make
those
arguments
hesse
quotes
his
words
what
form
of
wealth
could
belong
to
a
man
if
not
a
work
of
the
mind
if
not
his
own
thoughts
the
most
precious
part
of
himself
that
will
never
perish
that
will
immortalize
him
what
comparison
could
there
be
between
a
man
the
very
substance
of
man
his
soul
and
a
field
a
tree
a
vine
that
nature
has
offered
in
the
beginning
equally
to
all
and
that
an
individual
has
only
appropriated
through
cultivating
it
diderot
theme
is
that
authors
rights
should
actually
be
stronger
than
other
property
rights
for
two
reasons
first
they
relate
to
the
very
essence
of
the
person
the
most
precious
part
of
himself
second
they
are
the
only
property
rights
over
something
that
has
been
added
to
the
existing
store
of
wealth
rather
than
taken
from
it
authorial
property
unlike
property
in
land
adds
to
the
common
store
rather
than
detracting
from
it
locke
believed
that
a
just
assertion
of
property
rights
must
leave
enough
and
as
good
for
others
in
the
society
what
could
better
satisfy
this
condition
than
a
property
right
over
a
novel
that
did
not
exist
before
i
wrote
it
one
hundred
years
later
victor
hugo
echoed
the
same
thoughts
in
a
speech
to
the
conseil
and
pointed
out
at
the
same
time
that
literary
property
rights
could
potentially
reconcile
troublesome
authors
to
society
and
state
you
feel
the
importance
and
necessity
of
defending
property
today
well
begin
by
recognising
the
first
and
most
sacred
of
all
properties
the
one
which
is
neither
a
transmission
nor
an
acquisition
but
a
creation
namely
literary
property
reconcile
the
artists
with
society
by
means
of
diderot
wanted
perpetual
copyrights
for
authors
and
agreeably
to
his
employers
a
correspondingly
perpetual
printing
privilege
if
the
author
heirs
could
not
be
traced
the
copyright
would
devolve
to
the
current
publisher
but
as
hesse
points
out
there
was
another
view
of
literary
property
a
much
more
skeptical
one
put
forward
best
by
condorcet
this
view
is
also
an
influential
part
of
the
heritage
of
the
droits
even
if
it
is
downplayed
in
its
contemporary
rhetoric
condorcet
began
by
framing
the
question
of
literary
property
as
one
of
political
liberty
does
a
man
have
the
right
to
forbid
another
man
to
write
the
same
words
that
he
himself
wrote
first
that
is
the
question
to
resolve
like
jefferson
condorcet
is
utterly
unconvinced
that
property
rights
in
a
book
can
be
compared
to
those
in
a
field
or
a
piece
of
furniture
which
can
be
occupied
or
used
by
only
one
man
the
type
of
property
is
based
on
the
nature
of
the
thing
he
concluded
again
in
language
strikingly
similar
to
and
macaulay
that
literary
property
was
not
a
real
property
right
but
a
privilege
and
one
which
must
be
assessed
on
a
utilitarian
basis
in
terms
of
its
contribution
to
any
privilege
therefore
imposes
a
hindrance
on
freedom
placing
a
restriction
on
the
rights
of
other
citizens
as
such
it
is
not
only
harmful
to
the
rights
of
others
who
want
to
copy
but
the
rights
of
all
those
who
want
copies
and
that
which
increases
the
price
is
an
injustice
does
the
public
interest
require
that
men
make
this
sacrifice
that
is
the
question
that
must
be
considered
in
other
words
are
literary
privileges
needed
and
useful
or
harmful
to
the
progress
of
enlightenment
condorcet
conclusion
was
that
they
were
not
necessary
and
that
they
could
be
harmful
the
books
that
most
furthered
the
progress
of
enlightenment
the
encyclopédie
the
works
of
montesquieu
voltaire
rousseau
have
not
enjoyed
the
benefits
of
a
privilege
instead
he
seemed
to
favor
a
combination
of
subscriptions
to
authors
with
a
protection
which
allowed
an
author
to
identify
a
particular
edition
of
his
work
as
the
genuine
one
but
which
also
allowed
competing
editions
to
circulate
freely
in
such
a
market
he
believed
that
the
price
of
the
competing
editions
would
fall
to
natural
levels
today
we
would
call
it
marginal
cost
but
the
original
author
would
still
be
able
to
charge
a
modest
premium
for
the
edition
he
authorized
or
certified
because
readers
would
prefer
it
as
both
more
accurate
and
more
authentic
one
possible
analogy
is
to
the
history
of
the
fashion
industry
in
the
united
states
it
operates
largely
without
design
protection
but
relies
heavily
on
the
trademarks
accorded
to
favored
designers
and
brands
there
are
knockoffs
of
armani
or
balenciaga
but
the
wealthy
still
pay
an
enormous
premium
for
the
real
thing
condorcet
also
insisted
that
whatever
protection
was
accorded
to
literary
works
must
not
extend
to
the
ideas
within
them
it
is
the
truths
within
books
that
make
them
useful
a
word
that
does
not
have
the
same
luminance
and
importance
for
us
today
as
it
did
for
the
philosophers
of
the
enlightenment
or
the
french
revolution
he
argued
that
any
privilege
given
the
author
could
not
extend
to
preventing
another
man
from
exhibiting
the
same
truths
in
perfectly
the
same
order
from
the
same
evidence
or
from
extending
those
arguments
and
developing
their
consequences
in
a
line
that
hesse
rightly
highlights
he
declares
that
any
privileges
do
not
extend
over
facts
or
ideas
ce
pas
pour
les
choses
les
idées
pour
les
mots
pour
le
nom
de
in
sum
condorcet
favors
a
limited
privilege
circumscribed
by
an
inquiry
into
its
effects
in
promoting
progress
and
enlightenment
the
privilege
only
applies
to
expression
and
to
the
author
name
rather
than
to
facts
and
ideas
this
is
very
much
within
the
tradition
of
jefferson
and
macaulay
hesse
argues
correctly
i
think
that
two
warring
ideas
shaped
or
are
at
least
useful
ways
of
understanding
the
development
of
the
droits
tradition
on
one
side
were
diderot
and
the
publishers
promoting
an
expansive
and
perpetual
natural
authorial
right
which
nevertheless
was
supposed
to
vest
suspiciously
easily
in
publishers
on
the
other
was
condorcet
looking
skeptically
at
authorial
privileges
as
merely
one
type
of
state
interference
with
free
markets
and
the
free
circulation
of
books
and
ideas
in
place
of
diderot
perpetual
natural
right
condorcet
sketched
out
a
regime
that
encourages
production
and
distribution
by
granting
the
minimum
rights
necessary
for
progress
different
as
they
are
these
two
sides
share
a
common
ground
they
both
focus
though
for
different
reasons
on
expression
the
imprimatur
of
the
author
unique
human
spirit
on
the
ideas
and
facts
that
he
or
she
transmits
it
is
this
original
expression
that
modern
copyright
and
the
modern
droits
actually
cover
in
today
copyright
law
the
facts
and
ideas
in
an
author
work
proceed
immediately
into
the
public
domain
in
other
work
i
have
argued
that
by
confining
the
property
right
tightly
to
the
original
expression
stemming
from
the
unique
personality
of
an
individual
author
the
law
seems
to
accomplish
a
number
of
things
simultaneously
it
provides
a
conceptual
basis
for
partial
limited
property
rights
without
completely
collapsing
the
notion
of
property
into
the
idea
of
a
temporary
limited
utilitarian
state
grant
revocable
at
will
at
the
same
time
it
offers
a
moral
and
philosophical
justification
for
fencing
in
the
commons
giving
the
author
property
in
something
built
from
the
resources
of
the
public
domain
language
culture
genre
scientific
community
or
what
have
you
if
one
makes
originality
of
spirit
the
assumed
feature
of
authorship
and
the
touchstone
for
property
rights
one
can
see
the
author
as
creating
something
entirely
new
not
recombining
the
resources
of
the
that
is
an
account
of
the
romantic
theory
of
authorship
in
the
context
of
contemporary
copyright
law
but
when
one
looks
at
the
history
of
the
french
droits
tradition
it
is
striking
how
well
those
words
describe
that
system
as
well
when
the
french
legislature
finally
produced
a
law
of
authors
rights
it
turned
out
in
hesse
words
to
reflect
an
epistemologically
impure
and
unstable
legal
synthesis
that
combined
an
instrumentalist
notion
of
the
public
good
with
a
theory
of
authorship
based
on
natural
rights
although
it
drew
on
a
diderotist
rhetoric
of
the
sanctity
of
individual
creativity
as
an
inviolable
right
it
did
not
rigorously
respect
the
conclusions
diderot
drew
from
this
position
in
contrast
to
the
privilège
of
the
law
did
not
recognize
the
author
claim
beyond
his
lifetime
but
consecrated
the
notion
advanced
first
by
pierre
manuel
to
defend
his
edition
of
mirabeau
that
the
only
true
heir
to
an
author
work
was
the
nation
as
a
whole
this
notion
of
a
public
domain
of
democratic
access
to
a
common
cultural
inheritance
on
which
no
particular
claim
could
be
made
bore
the
traces
not
of
diderot
but
of
condorcet
faith
that
truths
were
given
in
nature
and
although
mediated
through
individual
minds
belonged
ultimately
to
all
progress
in
human
understanding
depended
not
on
private
knowledge
claims
but
on
free
and
equal
access
to
enlightenment
an
author
property
rights
were
conceived
as
recompense
for
his
service
as
an
agent
of
enlightenment
through
publication
of
his
ideas
the
law
of
accomplished
this
task
of
synthesis
through
political
negotiation
rather
than
philosophical
reasoning
that
is
by
refashioning
the
political
identity
of
the
author
in
the
first
few
years
of
the
revolution
from
a
privileged
creature
of
the
absolutist
police
state
into
a
servant
of
public
hesse
argues
that
this
instability
would
continue
through
the
revolutionary
period
i
agree
indeed
i
would
argue
that
it
does
so
to
the
present
day
why
the
answer
is
simple
the
moral
rights
view
simply
proved
too
much
without
a
limiting
principle
of
time
or
scope
or
effect
it
seemed
to
presage
a
perpetual
and
expansive
control
of
expressive
creations
and
perhaps
of
inventions
our
intuition
that
this
is
a
bad
idea
comes
from
our
intuitive
understanding
that
poetry
can
only
be
made
out
of
other
poems
novels
out
of
other
novels
all
of
this
was
much
clearer
before
the
assimilation
of
literature
to
private
enterprise
this
is
the
flip
side
of
the
arguments
that
diderot
and
later
hugo
put
forward
perhaps
the
romantic
author
does
not
create
out
of
thin
air
perhaps
he
or
she
is
deeply
embedded
in
a
literary
musical
cultural
or
scientific
tradition
that
would
not
flourish
if
treated
as
a
set
of
permanently
walled
private
plots
even
within
the
tradition
we
see
a
recognition
that
the
continuing
progress
of
enlightenment
and
the
ssacred
genius
of
authors
might
both
require
a
certain
level
of
freedom
in
knowledge
inputs
and
a
certain
level
of
control
over
knowledge
outputs
we
see
also
the
recognition
that
these
two
requirements
are
in
fundamental
tension
when
it
comes
to
reconciling
that
tension
we
must
turn
in
part
to
utilitarian
effects
in
short
we
should
pay
attention
to
jefferson
and
macaulay
and
condorcet
not
just
because
their
thoughts
shaped
the
legal
and
philosophical
traditions
in
which
we
now
work
though
that
is
particularly
true
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
but
because
they
were
right
or
at
least
more
right
than
the
alternative
of
course
we
could
build
a
culture
around
a
notion
of
natural
absolute
and
permanent
rights
to
invention
and
expression
it
is
not
a
world
many
of
us
would
want
to
live
in
there
are
exceptions
of
course
in
a
recent
new
york
times
mark
helprin
author
of
winter
tale
argued
that
intellectual
property
should
become
after
all
rights
in
real
estate
or
personal
property
do
not
expire
though
their
owners
might
why
is
it
that
copyrights
should
only
last
for
a
lifetime
plus
seventy
additional
years
or
patents
for
a
mere
twenty
helprin
expresses
respect
for
the
genius
of
the
framers
but
is
unmoved
by
their
firm
command
that
rights
be
granted
only
for
limited
times
he
concludes
that
it
was
a
misunderstanding
jefferson
did
not
realize
that
while
ideas
can
not
be
owned
their
expression
can
what
more
the
framers
were
misled
by
their
rustic
times
no
one
except
perhaps
hamilton
or
franklin
might
have
imagined
that
services
and
intellectual
property
would
become
primary
fields
of
endeavor
and
the
chief
engines
of
the
economy
now
they
are
and
it
is
no
more
rational
to
deny
them
equal
status
than
it
would
have
been
to
confiscate
farms
ropewalks
and
other
forms
of
property
in
the
century
poor
jefferson
how
lucky
we
are
to
have
helprin
to
remedy
the
consequences
of
his
lack
of
vision
or
perhaps
not
think
of
the
way
that
jefferson
traced
the
origins
of
the
mechanical
arts
used
in
the
elevators
and
boys
all
the
way
back
to
ancient
persia
in
utopia
presumably
a
royalty
stream
would
run
to
cyrus
the
great
engineers
jefferson
point
was
that
for
the
process
of
invention
to
work
we
need
to
confine
narrowly
the
time
and
scope
of
the
monopoly
otherwise
further
inventions
would
become
impossible
each
process
or
part
of
a
new
invention
would
risk
infringing
a
myriad
of
prior
patents
on
its
subcomponents
innovation
would
strangle
in
a
thicket
of
conflicting
monopolies
with
their
roots
vanishing
back
in
time
presumably
the
title
of
helprin
excellent
novel
would
require
clearance
from
shakespeare
heirs
of
course
one
could
construct
a
more
modest
lockean
idea
of
intellectual
building
on
the
notion
of
enough
and
as
good
left
over
for
others
and
drawing
the
limits
tightly
enough
to
avoid
the
worst
of
helprin
excesses
but
as
one
attempts
to
do
this
systematically
the
power
of
the
jeffersonian
vision
becomes
all
the
more
apparent
at
least
as
a
starting
place
the
jefferson
warning
will
play
an
important
role
in
this
book
but
my
arguments
here
have
implications
far
beyond
time
country
or
constitutional
tradition
in
the
last
analysis
i
hope
to
convince
you
of
the
importance
of
the
jefferson
warning
or
the
views
of
macaulay
not
because
they
are
famous
authorities
and
revered
thinkers
or
because
they
framed
constitutions
or
debated
legislation
i
wish
to
convince
you
that
their
views
are
important
because
they
encapsulate
neatly
an
important
series
of
truths
about
intellectual
property
we
should
listen
to
the
jefferson
warning
not
because
it
is
prestigious
but
because
of
its
insight
as
the
debates
point
out
the
questions
on
which
jefferson
and
macaulay
focused
do
not
disappear
merely
because
one
embraces
a
philosophy
of
moral
rights
if
anything
they
become
more
pressing
particularly
when
one
comes
to
define
the
limits
of
intellectual
property
in
scope
and
time
i
ask
that
those
readers
who
remain
leery
of
the
jeffersonian
focus
concentrate
on
that
last
issue
in
an
era
when
we
have
been
expanding
intellectual
property
rights
relentlessly
it
is
a
crucial
one
if
the
jefferson
warning
produces
in
my
unconvinced
reader
even
a
slight
queasiness
about
the
likely
effects
of
such
a
process
of
expansion
it
will
have
done
its
job
though
in
fact
the
tradition
it
represented
was
much
richer
than
a
simple
utilitarian
series
of
cautions
a
tradition
of
skeptical
minimalism
and
intellectual
property
debates
went
beyond
macaulay
antimonopolist
focus
on
price
access
quality
and
control
of
the
nation
literary
heritage
while
macaulay
is
the
english
skeptic
from
the
there
were
other
more
radical
skeptics
who
saw
copyright
primarily
as
a
tax
on
literacy
or
a
tax
on
knowledge
identical
in
its
effects
to
the
newspaper
stamp
this
was
a
time
when
mass
literacy
and
mass
education
were
the
hotly
debated
corollaries
to
the
enlargement
of
the
franchise
the
radical
reformers
looked
with
hostility
on
anything
that
seemed
likely
to
raise
the
cost
of
reading
and
thus
continue
to
restrict
political
and
social
debate
to
the
wealthier
classes
macaulay
worried
about
a
world
in
which
a
copy
of
clarissa
would
be
as
rare
as
an
aldus
or
a
caxton
his
more
radical
colleagues
saw
copyright
to
use
our
ugly
jargon
rather
than
theirs
as
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
state
communications
policy
is
set
and
the
communicative
landscape
tilted
to
favor
the
rich
and
macaulay
worried
about
the
effects
of
monopoly
on
literature
and
culture
all
of
them
worried
about
the
effects
of
copyright
on
democracy
on
speech
on
education
in
the
world
of
the
internet
these
skeptics
too
have
their
contemporary
equivalents
patent
law
also
attracted
its
share
of
attacks
in
the
nineteenth
century
a
fusillade
of
criticism
often
delivered
by
economists
and
cast
in
the
language
of
free
trade
portrayed
the
patent
system
as
actively
harmful
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
kongress
deutscher
volkswirthe
held
in
dresden
september
the
following
resolution
was
adopted
by
an
overwhelming
majority
considering
that
patents
hinder
rather
than
further
the
progress
of
invention
that
they
hamper
the
prompt
general
utilization
of
useful
inventions
that
on
balance
they
cause
more
harm
than
benefit
to
the
inventors
themselves
and
thus
are
a
highly
deceptive
form
of
compensation
the
congress
of
german
economists
resolves
that
patents
of
invention
are
injurious
to
common
welfare
in
the
netherlands
the
patent
system
was
actually
abolished
in
as
a
result
of
such
criticisms
observers
in
a
number
of
other
countries
including
britain
concluded
that
their
national
patent
systems
were
doomed
various
proposals
were
made
to
replace
patents
with
prizes
or
bounties
to
particularly
useful
inventions
being
the
most
these
snippets
are
hardly
sufficient
to
constitute
any
kind
of
survey
of
critical
reactions
to
intellectual
property
systems
but
i
believe
that
nevertheless
they
give
us
some
sense
of
typical
debates
what
do
these
debates
tell
us
from
the
early
days
of
intellectual
property
as
we
know
it
now
the
main
objections
raised
against
it
were
framed
in
the
language
of
free
trade
and
in
the
united
states
the
founding
generation
of
intellectuals
had
been
nurtured
on
the
philosophy
of
the
scottish
enlightenment
and
the
history
of
the
struggle
against
royal
monopolies
they
saw
the
arguments
in
favor
of
intellectual
property
but
warned
again
and
again
of
the
need
to
circumscribe
both
its
term
and
its
scope
this
is
the
point
at
the
heart
of
jefferson
letter
this
is
why
he
insisted
that
we
understand
the
policy
implications
of
the
differences
between
tangible
property
and
ideas
which
like
fire
are
expansible
over
all
space
without
lessening
their
density
in
any
point
what
were
the
concerns
of
these
early
critics
they
worried
about
intellectual
property
producing
artificial
scarcity
high
prices
and
low
quality
they
insisted
that
the
benefits
of
each
incremental
expansion
of
intellectual
property
be
weighed
against
its
costs
think
of
macaulay
discussing
preference
for
a
shin
of
beef
rather
than
another
slice
of
postmortem
copyright
protection
they
worried
about
its
justice
given
that
we
all
learn
from
and
build
on
the
past
do
we
have
a
right
to
carve
out
our
own
incremental
innovations
and
protect
them
by
intellectual
property
rights
price
aside
they
also
worried
that
intellectual
property
especially
with
a
lengthy
term
might
give
too
much
control
to
a
single
individual
or
corporation
over
some
vital
aspect
of
science
and
culture
in
more
muted
fashion
they
discussed
the
possible
effects
that
intellectual
property
might
have
on
future
innovation
the
most
radical
among
them
worried
about
intellectual
property
effects
on
political
debate
education
and
even
control
of
the
communications
infrastructure
though
they
did
not
use
that
particular
phrase
but
the
overwhelming
theme
was
the
promotion
of
free
trade
and
a
corresponding
opposition
to
monopolies
now
if
we
were
to
stop
here
and
simply
require
that
policy
makers
legislators
and
judges
recite
the
jefferson
warning
before
they
rush
off
to
make
new
intellectual
property
rules
for
the
internet
and
the
genome
we
would
have
accomplished
a
great
deal
national
and
international
policy
makers
are
keen
to
set
the
rules
of
the
road
for
the
digital
age
if
they
would
momentarily
pause
their
excited
millenarian
burbling
and
read
the
points
scratched
out
with
a
quill
pen
in
or
delivered
without
powerpoint
support
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
commons
in
the
we
would
be
better
off
everyone
is
beginning
to
understand
that
in
the
world
of
the
century
the
rules
of
intellectual
property
are
both
vital
and
contentious
how
good
it
would
be
then
if
our
debate
on
intellectual
property
policy
were
as
vigorous
and
as
informed
as
the
debates
of
the
nineteenth
century
though
we
might
hope
it
would
also
be
more
democratic
and
yet
there
is
much
that
is
missing
from
the
skepticism
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
and
much
that
remains
unclear
look
at
the
structure
of
these
comments
they
are
framed
as
criticisms
of
intellectual
property
rather
than
defenses
of
the
public
domain
or
the
commons
terms
that
simply
do
not
appear
in
the
debates
there
is
no
real
discussion
of
the
world
of
intellectual
property
outside
its
opposite
most
of
these
critics
take
as
their
goal
the
prevention
or
limitation
of
an
artificial
monopoly
without
this
monopoly
our
goal
is
to
have
a
world
of
what
the
assumption
is
that
we
will
return
to
a
norm
of
freedom
but
of
what
kind
free
trade
in
expression
and
innovation
as
opposed
to
monopoly
free
access
to
expression
and
innovation
as
opposed
to
access
for
pay
or
free
access
to
innovation
and
expression
in
the
sense
of
not
being
subject
to
the
right
of
another
person
to
pick
and
choose
who
is
given
access
even
if
all
have
to
pay
some
flat
fee
or
is
it
common
ownership
and
control
that
we
seek
including
the
communal
right
to
forbid
certain
kinds
of
uses
of
the
shared
resource
the
and
critics
brushed
over
these
points
but
to
be
fair
we
continue
to
do
so
today
the
opposite
of
property
or
perhaps
we
should
say
the
opposites
of
property
are
much
more
obscure
to
us
than
property
itself
for
the
most
part
the
antimonopolist
view
of
intellectual
property
makes
a
simple
case
monopolies
are
bad
have
as
few
as
possible
and
make
them
as
narrow
and
as
short
as
possible
this
is
a
fine
principle
but
it
falls
short
of
an
affirmative
explanation
and
defense
of
the
role
of
the
public
domain
or
the
commons
in
enabling
creativity
culture
and
science
that
is
a
shame
because
just
as
intellectual
property
is
different
from
tangible
property
so
too
is
its
opposite
its
outside
what
are
those
opposites
the
two
major
terms
in
use
are
the
public
domain
and
the
commons
both
are
used
in
multiple
ways
probably
a
good
thing
the
public
domain
is
material
that
is
not
covered
by
intellectual
property
rights
material
might
be
in
the
public
domain
because
it
was
never
capable
of
being
owned
examples
would
be
the
english
language
or
the
formulae
of
newtonian
physics
alternatively
something
might
be
in
the
public
domain
because
rights
have
expired
the
works
of
shakespeare
or
the
patents
over
powered
flight
are
examples
some
definitions
of
the
public
domain
are
more
granular
they
focus
not
only
on
complete
works
but
on
the
reserved
spaces
of
freedom
inside
intellectual
property
the
public
domain
would
include
the
privilege
to
excerpt
short
quotations
in
a
review
this
vision
is
messier
but
more
instructive
if
one
uses
a
spatial
metaphor
the
absolutist
vision
is
a
tessellated
map
areas
of
private
property
are
neatly
delineated
from
areas
of
the
public
domain
mozart
plot
sits
next
to
that
of
britney
spears
one
public
the
other
private
in
the
granular
view
the
map
is
more
complex
spears
plot
is
cut
through
with
rights
to
make
fair
use
as
well
as
with
limitations
on
ownership
of
standard
themes
instead
of
the
simple
tiled
map
the
granular
vision
has
private
plots
with
public
roads
running
through
them
in
popular
discussion
we
tend
to
use
the
absolutist
view
of
both
property
and
the
public
domain
lawyers
prefer
the
more
complex
view
of
property
and
are
coming
slowly
to
have
a
similarly
complex
view
of
the
public
domain
that
is
the
definition
i
will
be
using
the
term
commons
is
generally
used
to
denote
a
resource
over
which
some
group
has
access
and
use
rights
albeit
perhaps
under
certain
conditions
it
is
used
in
even
more
ways
than
the
term
public
domain
the
first
axis
along
which
definitions
of
the
term
commons
vary
is
the
size
of
the
group
that
has
access
rights
some
would
say
it
is
a
commons
only
if
the
whole
society
has
access
that
is
the
view
i
will
take
here
the
other
difference
between
public
domain
and
commons
is
the
extent
of
restrictions
on
use
material
in
the
public
domain
is
free
of
property
rights
you
may
do
with
it
what
you
wish
a
commons
can
be
restrictive
for
example
some
open
source
software
makes
your
freedom
to
modify
the
software
contingent
on
the
condition
that
your
contributions
too
will
be
freely
open
to
others
i
will
discuss
this
type
of
commons
in
chapter
so
these
are
working
definitions
of
public
domain
and
commons
but
why
should
we
care
because
the
public
domain
is
the
basis
for
our
art
our
science
and
our
it
is
the
raw
material
from
which
we
make
new
inventions
and
create
new
cultural
works
why
is
it
so
important
let
us
start
with
the
dry
reasons
information
and
innovation
are
largely
nonrival
and
nonexcludable
goods
this
is
jefferson
point
though
expressed
in
less
graceful
language
it
has
some
interesting
corollaries
information
is
hard
to
value
until
you
have
it
but
once
you
have
it
how
can
you
dispossess
yourself
of
it
the
apple
can
be
taken
back
by
the
merchant
if
you
decide
not
to
buy
the
facts
or
the
formulae
can
not
the
moment
when
you
might
have
decided
to
pay
or
not
to
pay
is
already
over
the
great
economist
kenneth
arrow
formalized
this
insight
about
information
and
it
profoundly
shapes
intellectual
property
policy
to
a
large
extent
for
example
the
requirement
of
patent
disclosure
attempts
to
solve
this
problem
i
can
read
all
about
your
mousetrap
but
i
am
still
forbidden
from
using
it
i
can
decide
whether
or
not
to
license
your
design
at
that
point
but
for
all
the
material
in
the
public
domain
where
no
intellectual
property
right
is
necessary
this
point
is
solved
elegantly
by
having
the
information
be
free
as
the
air
to
common
use
all
of
us
can
use
the
same
store
of
information
innovation
and
free
culture
it
will
be
available
at
its
cost
of
reproduction
close
to
zero
and
we
can
all
build
upon
it
without
interfering
with
each
other
think
of
the
english
language
basic
business
methods
tables
of
logarithms
the
pythagorean
theorem
shakespeare
insights
about
human
nature
the
periodic
table
ohm
law
the
sonnet
form
the
musical
scale
would
you
have
paid
to
purchase
access
to
each
of
these
i
might
tell
you
that
english
was
a
superior
communication
tool
a
really
good
command
language
for
your
cognitive
operating
system
there
could
be
levels
of
access
with
corresponding
prices
would
you
pay
to
get
access
to
english
professional
edition
we
can
certainly
imagine
such
a
way
of
organizing
languages
to
some
extent
scribal
conventions
operated
this
way
the
languages
of
the
professions
still
do
one
paid
for
access
to
law
french
in
the
common
law
courts
of
england
one
pays
for
an
interpreter
of
contemporary
legal
jargon
in
today
legal
system
but
even
there
the
language
is
free
to
the
autodidact
we
can
imagine
language
scientific
knowledge
basic
algebra
the
tonic
scale
or
the
classics
of
literature
all
being
available
only
as
property
those
who
had
the
highest
value
for
use
would
purchase
them
those
who
did
not
value
them
highly
whether
because
they
could
not
know
what
could
be
built
with
them
until
they
had
done
so
or
because
they
did
not
have
the
money
would
not
what
would
this
world
this
culture
this
science
this
market
look
like
it
would
probably
be
very
inefficient
the
economists
tell
us
perfect
information
is
a
defining
feature
of
the
perfect
market
the
more
commodified
and
restricted
our
access
to
information
the
less
efficient
the
operation
of
the
market
the
more
poorly
it
allocates
resources
in
our
society
the
permanent
and
in
some
sense
insoluble
tension
between
the
need
to
provide
incentives
to
generate
information
thus
raising
its
cost
and
the
need
to
have
access
to
perfect
information
for
efficiency
is
the
central
feature
of
our
intellectual
property
policy
when
we
commodify
too
much
we
actually
undermine
creativity
since
we
are
raising
the
price
of
the
inputs
for
future
creations
which
might
themselves
be
covered
by
intellectual
property
rights
but
inefficient
is
too
bloodless
a
way
to
describe
this
world
it
would
be
awful
our
markets
our
democracy
our
science
our
traditions
of
free
speech
and
our
art
all
depend
more
heavily
on
a
public
domain
of
freely
available
material
than
they
do
on
the
informational
material
that
is
covered
by
property
rights
the
public
domain
is
not
some
gummy
residue
left
behind
when
all
the
good
stuff
has
been
covered
by
property
law
the
public
domain
is
the
place
we
quarry
the
building
blocks
of
our
culture
it
is
in
fact
the
majority
of
our
culture
or
at
least
it
has
been
i
deliberately
gave
easy
examples
it
is
obvious
how
unnecessary
but
also
how
harmful
it
would
be
to
extend
property
rights
to
language
to
facts
to
business
methods
and
scientific
algorithms
to
the
basic
structures
of
music
to
art
whose
creators
are
long
dead
it
is
obvious
that
this
would
not
produce
more
innovation
more
debate
more
art
more
democracy
but
what
about
the
places
where
the
value
of
the
public
domain
is
not
obvious
what
if
we
were
actually
moving
to
extend
patents
to
business
methods
or
intellectual
property
rights
to
unoriginal
compilations
of
facts
what
if
we
had
locked
up
most
of
culture
without
getting
a
net
benefit
in
return
what
if
the
basic
building
blocks
of
new
scientific
fields
were
being
patented
long
before
anything
concrete
or
useful
could
be
built
from
them
what
if
we
were
littering
our
electronic
communication
space
with
digital
barbed
wire
and
regulating
the
tiniest
fragments
of
music
as
if
they
were
stock
certificates
what
if
we
were
doing
all
this
in
the
blithe
belief
that
more
property
rights
mean
more
innovation
the
story
of
this
book
is
that
we
are
the
jefferson
warning
is
important
it
is
however
just
a
warning
while
it
would
be
excellent
to
print
it
on
pocket
cards
and
hand
it
to
our
elected
representatives
that
alone
will
not
solve
the
most
pressing
problems
we
face
in
the
chapters
that
follow
i
shall
try
to
go
further
in
chapter
i
set
the
process
of
expansion
we
are
engaged
in
our
second
enclosure
movement
in
perspective
by
comparing
it
to
the
original
enclosures
of
the
grassy
commons
of
old
england
in
chapter
i
jump
from
the
world
of
the
fifteenth
or
nineteenth
century
to
the
world
of
the
from
elevators
and
grain
hoppers
to
video
recorders
the
internet
and
services
i
use
the
story
of
several
key
legal
disputes
to
illustrate
a
broader
history
the
history
of
intellectual
property
struggle
with
communications
technologies
that
allow
people
to
copy
more
cheaply
strangely
enough
the
jefferson
warning
will
be
crucial
in
understanding
the
debate
over
copyright
online
and
in
particular
in
understanding
the
fear
that
drives
our
current
policy
making
a
fear
i
refer
to
as
the
internet
threat
chapter
the
second
enclosure
movement
the
law
locks
up
the
man
or
woman
who
steals
the
goose
from
off
the
common
but
leaves
the
greater
villain
loose
who
steals
the
common
from
off
the
goose
the
law
demands
that
we
atone
when
we
take
things
we
do
not
own
but
leaves
the
lords
and
ladies
fine
who
take
things
that
are
yours
and
mine
the
poor
and
wretched
do
escape
if
they
conspire
the
law
to
break
this
must
be
so
but
they
endure
those
who
conspire
to
make
the
law
the
law
locks
up
the
man
or
woman
who
steals
the
goose
from
off
the
common
and
geese
will
still
a
common
lack
till
they
go
and
steal
it
back
anon
in
fits
and
starts
from
the
fifteenth
to
the
nineteenth
century
the
english
commons
was
enclosed
enclosure
did
not
necessarily
mean
physical
fencing
though
that
could
happen
more
likely
the
previously
common
land
was
simply
converted
into
private
property
generally
controlled
by
a
single
landholder
the
poem
that
begins
this
chapter
is
the
pithiest
condemnation
of
the
process
it
manages
in
a
few
lines
to
criticize
double
standards
expose
the
controversial
nature
of
property
rights
and
take
a
slap
at
the
legitimacy
of
state
power
and
it
does
this
all
with
humor
without
jargon
and
in
rhyming
couplets
academics
should
take
note
like
most
criticisms
of
the
enclosure
movement
the
poem
depicts
a
world
of
rapacious
privatization
a
conversion
into
private
property
of
something
that
had
formerly
been
common
property
or
perhaps
had
been
outside
the
property
system
altogether
one
kind
of
stealing
is
legal
says
the
poet
because
the
state
changes
the
law
of
property
to
give
the
lords
and
ladies
a
right
over
an
area
formerly
open
to
all
but
let
a
commoner
steal
something
and
he
is
locked
up
the
anonymous
author
was
not
alone
in
feeling
indignant
thomas
more
one
of
only
two
saints
to
write
really
good
political
theory
made
similar
points
though
he
used
sheep
rather
than
geese
in
his
argument
writing
in
the
sixteenth
century
he
had
argued
that
enclosure
was
not
merely
unjust
in
itself
but
harmful
in
its
consequences
a
cause
of
economic
inequality
crime
and
social
dislocation
in
a
wonderfully
bizarre
passage
he
argues
that
sheep
are
a
principal
cause
of
theft
sheep
why
yes
y
our
sheep
that
were
wont
to
be
so
meek
and
tame
and
so
small
eaters
now
as
i
hear
say
be
become
so
great
devourers
and
so
wild
that
they
eat
up
and
swallow
down
the
very
men
themselves
they
consume
destroy
and
devour
whole
fields
houses
and
cities
who
were
these
sheep
bizarre
clones
transgenic
killer
rams
no
more
meant
only
that
under
the
economic
lure
of
the
wool
trade
the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
were
attempting
their
own
enclosure
movement
they
leave
no
ground
for
tillage
they
enclose
all
into
pastures
they
throw
down
houses
they
pluck
down
towns
and
leave
nothing
standing
but
only
the
church
to
be
made
a
house
therefore
that
one
covetous
and
insatiable
cormorant
and
very
plague
of
his
native
country
may
compass
about
and
enclose
many
thousand
acres
of
ground
together
within
one
pale
or
hedge
the
husbandmen
be
thrust
out
of
their
the
sheep
devour
all
the
dispossessed
husbandmen
now
find
themselves
without
land
or
money
and
turn
instead
to
theft
in
more
vision
it
is
all
very
simple
greed
leads
to
enclosure
enclosure
disrupts
the
life
of
the
poor
farmer
disruption
leads
to
crime
and
violence
writing
years
later
karl
polanyi
echoes
more
precisely
he
calls
the
enclosure
movement
a
revolution
of
the
rich
against
the
poor
and
goes
on
to
paint
it
in
the
most
unflattering
light
the
lords
and
nobles
were
upsetting
the
social
order
breaking
down
ancient
law
and
custom
sometimes
by
means
of
violence
often
by
pressure
and
intimidation
they
were
literally
robbing
the
poor
of
their
share
in
the
common
and
turning
them
to
beggars
and
thieves
the
critics
of
enclosure
saw
other
harms
too
though
they
are
harder
to
classify
they
bemoaned
the
relentless
power
of
market
logic
to
migrate
to
new
areas
disrupting
traditional
social
relationships
and
perhaps
even
views
of
the
self
or
the
relationship
of
human
beings
to
the
environment
fundamentally
they
mourned
the
loss
of
a
form
of
life
so
much
for
the
bad
side
of
the
enclosure
movement
for
many
economic
historians
everything
i
have
said
up
to
now
is
the
worst
kind
of
sentimental
bunk
romanticizing
a
form
of
life
that
was
neither
comfortable
nor
noble
and
certainly
not
very
egalitarian
the
big
point
about
the
enclosure
movement
is
that
it
worked
this
innovation
in
property
systems
allowed
an
unparalleled
expansion
of
productive
possibilities
by
transferring
inefficiently
managed
common
land
into
the
hands
of
a
single
owner
enclosure
escaped
the
aptly
named
tragedy
of
the
commons
it
gave
incentives
for
investment
allowed
control
over
exploitation
and
in
general
ensured
that
resources
could
be
put
to
their
most
efficient
use
before
the
enclosure
movement
the
feudal
lord
would
not
invest
in
drainage
systems
sheep
purchases
or
crop
rotation
that
might
increase
yields
from
the
common
he
knew
all
too
well
that
the
fruits
of
his
labor
could
be
appropriated
by
others
the
strong
private
property
rights
and
control
that
were
introduced
in
the
enclosure
movement
avoid
the
tragedies
of
overuse
and
underinvestment
more
grain
will
be
grown
more
sheep
raised
consumers
will
benefit
and
fewer
people
will
starve
in
the
long
run
if
the
price
of
this
social
gain
is
a
greater
concentration
of
economic
power
the
introduction
of
market
forces
into
areas
where
they
previously
had
not
been
so
obvious
or
the
disruption
of
a
modus
vivendi
with
the
environment
then
defenders
say
so
be
it
in
their
view
the
agricultural
surplus
produced
by
enclosure
helped
to
save
a
society
devastated
by
the
mass
deaths
of
the
sixteenth
century
those
who
weep
over
the
terrible
effects
of
private
property
should
realize
that
it
literally
saves
lives
now
it
is
worth
noting
that
while
this
view
was
once
unchallenged
recent
scholarship
has
thrown
some
doubts
on
the
effects
of
enclosure
on
agricultural
production
some
scholars
argue
that
the
commons
was
actually
better
run
than
the
defenders
of
enclosure
admit
thus
while
enclosure
did
produce
the
changes
in
the
distribution
of
wealth
that
so
incensed
an
earlier
generation
of
critical
historians
they
argue
that
there
are
significant
questions
about
whether
it
led
to
greater
efficiency
or
innovation
the
pie
was
carved
up
differently
but
did
it
get
bigger
the
debate
about
these
issues
is
little
known
however
outside
the
world
of
economic
historians
everyone
knows
that
a
commons
is
by
definition
tragic
and
that
the
logic
of
enclosure
is
as
true
today
as
it
was
in
the
fifteenth
century
i
will
not
get
involved
in
this
debate
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
enclosure
did
indeed
produce
a
surge
in
agriculture
assume
in
other
words
that
converting
the
commons
into
private
property
saved
lives
this
is
the
logic
of
enclosure
it
is
a
powerful
argument
but
it
is
not
always
right
this
is
all
very
well
but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
intellectual
property
i
hope
the
answer
is
obvious
the
argument
of
this
book
is
that
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
second
enclosure
movement
while
it
sounds
grandiloquent
to
call
it
the
enclosure
of
the
intangible
commons
of
the
mind
in
a
very
real
sense
that
is
just
what
it
is
true
the
new
created
property
rights
may
be
intellectual
rather
than
real
but
once
again
things
that
were
formerly
thought
of
as
common
property
or
as
uncommodifiable
or
outside
the
market
altogether
are
being
covered
with
new
or
newly
extended
property
rights
take
the
human
genome
as
an
example
again
the
supporters
of
enclosure
have
argued
that
the
state
was
right
to
step
in
and
extend
the
reach
of
property
rights
that
only
thus
could
we
guarantee
the
kind
of
investment
of
time
ingenuity
and
capital
necessary
to
produce
new
drugs
and
gene
therapies
to
the
question
should
there
be
patents
over
human
genes
the
supporters
of
enclosure
would
answer
that
private
property
saves
lives
the
opponents
of
enclosure
have
claimed
that
the
human
genome
belongs
to
everyone
that
it
is
literally
the
common
heritage
of
humankind
that
it
should
not
and
perhaps
in
some
sense
can
not
be
owned
and
that
the
consequences
of
turning
over
the
human
genome
to
private
property
rights
will
be
dreadful
as
market
logic
invades
areas
which
should
be
the
farthest
from
the
market
in
stories
about
stem
cell
and
gene
sequence
patents
critics
have
mused
darkly
about
the
way
in
which
the
state
is
handing
over
monopoly
power
to
a
few
individuals
and
corporations
potentially
introducing
bottlenecks
and
coordination
costs
that
slow
down
innovation
alongside
these
accounts
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
new
property
scheme
run
news
stories
about
those
who
were
not
so
fortunate
the
commoners
of
the
genetic
enclosure
law
students
across
america
read
moore
regents
of
university
of
california
a
california
supreme
court
case
deciding
that
moore
had
no
property
interest
in
the
cells
derived
from
his
spleen
the
court
tells
us
that
giving
private
property
rights
to
sources
would
slow
the
freewheeling
practice
researchers
have
of
sharing
their

with

here
by

are
a
necessary
incentive
to
research
economists
on
both
sides
of
the
enclosure
debate
concentrate
on
the
efficient
allocation
of
rights
popular
discussion
on
the
other
hand
doubtless
demonstrating
a
reprehensible
lack
of
rigor
returns
again
and
again
to
more
naturalistic
assumptions
such
as
the
essentially
common
quality
of
the
property
involved
or
the
idea
that
one
owns
one
own
body
the
genome
is
not
the
only
area
to
be
partially
enclosed
during
this
second
enclosure
movement
the
expansion
of
intellectual
property
rights
has
been
remarkable
from
business
method
patents
to
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
to
trademark
rulings
to
the
european
database
protection
directive
the
old
limits
to
intellectual
property
rights
the
antierosion
walls
around
the
public
domain
are
also
under
attack
the
annual
process
of
updating
my
syllabus
for
a
basic
intellectual
property
course
provides
a
nice
snapshot
of
what
is
going
on
i
can
wax
nostalgic
looking
back
to
a
text
with
its
confident
list
of
subject
matter
that
intellectual
property
rights
could
not
cover
the
privileges
that
circumscribed
the
rights
that
did
exist
and
the
length
of
time
before
a
work
falls
into
the
public
domain
in
each
case
the
limits
have
been
eaten
away
how
much
of
the
intangible
commons
should
we
enclose
so
far
i
have
argued
that
there
are
profound
similarities
between
the
first
enclosure
movement
and
our
contemporary
expansion
of
intellectual
property
which
i
call
the
second
enclosure
movement
once
again
the
critics
and
proponents
of
enclosure
are
locked
in
battle
hurling
at
each
other
incommensurable
claims
about
innovation
efficiency
traditional
values
the
boundaries
of
the
market
the
saving
of
lives
the
loss
of
familiar
liberties
once
again
opposition
to
enclosure
is
portrayed
as
economically
illiterate
the
beneficiaries
of
enclosure
telling
us
that
an
expansion
of
property
rights
is
needed
in
order
to
fuel
progress
indeed
the
war
washington
consensus
is
invoked
to
claim
that
the
lesson
of
history
itself
is
that
the
only
way
to
get
growth
and
efficiency
is
through
markets
property
rights
surely
are
the
sine
qua
non
of
markets
this
faith
in
enclosure
is
rooted
in
a
correspondingly
deep
pessimism
about
the
possibility
of
managing
resources
that
are
either
commonly
owned
or
owned
by
no
one
if
all
have
the
right
to
graze
their
herds
on
common
land
what
incentive
does
anyone
have
to
hold
back
my
attempt
to
safeguard
the
future
of
the
pasture
will
simply
be
undercut
by
others
anxious
to
get
theirs
while
the
getting
is
good
soon
the
pasture
will
be
overgrazed
and
all
our
flocks
will
go
hungry
in
a
article
garrett
hardin
came
up
with
the
phrase
that
would
become
shorthand
for
the
idea
that
there
were
inherent
problems
with
collectively
managed
resources
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
the
phrase
more
so
than
the
actual
arguments
in
his
article
has
come
to
exercise
considerable
power
over
our
policies
today
private
property
enclosure
is
portrayed
as
the
happy
ending
for
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
when
policy
makers
see
a
resource
that
is
unowned
they
tend
to
reach
reflexively
for
the
solving
idea
of
property
according
to
this
view
enclosure
is
not
a
revolution
of
the
rich
against
the
poor
it
is
a
revolution
to
save
the
waste
of
socially
vital
resources
to
say
that
some
social
resource
is
not
owned
by
an
individual
that
it
is
free
as
the
air
to
common
use
is
automatically
to
conjure
up
the
idea
that
it
is
being
wasted
but
if
there
are
similarities
between
our
two
enclosures
there
are
also
profound
dissimilarities
the
networked
commons
of
the
mind
has
many
different
characteristics
from
the
grassy
commons
of
old
england
i
want
to
concentrate
here
on
two
key
differences
between
the
intellectual
commons
and
the
commons
of
the
first
enclosure
movement
differences
that
should
lead
us
to
question
whether
this
commons
is
truly
tragic
and
to
ask
whether
stronger
intellectual
property
rights
really
are
the
solution
to
our
problems
these
differences
are
well
known
indeed
they
are
the
starting
point
for
most
intellectual
property
law
a
starting
point
that
jefferson
and
macaulay
have
already
laid
out
for
us
nevertheless
reflection
on
them
might
help
to
explain
both
the
problems
and
the
stakes
in
the
current
wave
of
expansion
unlike
the
earthy
commons
the
commons
of
the
mind
is
generally
nonrival
many
uses
of
land
are
mutually
exclusive
if
i
am
using
the
field
for
grazing
it
may
interfere
with
your
plans
to
use
it
for
growing
crops
by
contrast
a
gene
sequence
an
file
or
an
image
may
be
used
by
multiple
parties
my
use
does
not
interfere
with
yours
to
simplify
a
complicated
analysis
this
means
that
the
threat
of
overuse
of
fields
and
fisheries
is
generally
not
a
problem
with
the
informational
or
innovational
commons
thus
one
type
of
tragedy
of
the
commons
is
avoided
the
concerns
in
the
informational
commons
have
to
do
with
a
different
kind
of
collective
action
problem
the
problem
of
incentives
to
create
the
resource
in
the
first
place
the
difficulty
comes
from
the
assumption
that
information
goods
are
not
only
nonrival
uses
do
not
interfere
with
each
other
but
also
nonexcludable
it
is
impossible
or
at
least
hard
to
stop
one
unit
of
the
good
from
satisfying
an
infinite
number
of
users
at
zero
marginal
cost
pirates
will
copy
the
song
the
mousetrap
the
drug
formula
the
brand
the
rest
of
the
argument
is
well
known
lacking
an
ability
to
exclude
creators
will
be
unable
to
charge
for
their
creations
there
will
be
inadequate
incentives
to
create
thus
the
law
must
step
in
and
create
a
limited
monopoly
called
an
intellectual
property
right
how
about
the
argument
that
the
increasing
importance
of
products
to
the
world
economy
means
that
protection
must
increase
must
the
information
commons
be
enclosed
because
it
is
now
a
more
important
sector
of
economic
activity
this
was
certainly
one
of
the
arguments
for
the
first
enclosure
movement
for
example
during
the
napoleonic
wars
enclosure
was
defended
as
a
necessary
method
of
increasing
the
efficiency
of
agricultural
production
now
a
vital
sector
of
a
wartime
economy
here
we
come
to
another
big
difference
between
the
commons
of
the
mind
and
the
earthy
commons
as
has
frequently
been
pointed
out
information
products
are
often
made
up
of
fragments
of
other
information
products
your
information
output
is
someone
else
information
input
these
inputs
may
be
snippets
of
code
discoveries
prior
research
images
genres
of
work
cultural
references
or
databases
of
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
each
is
raw
material
for
future
innovation
every
increase
in
protection
raises
the
cost
of
or
reduces
access
to
the
raw
material
from
which
you
might
have
built
those
future
products
the
balance
is
a
delicate
one
one
nobel
economist
has
claimed
that
it
is
actually
impossible
to
strike
that
balance
so
as
to
produce
an
informationally
efficient
market
whether
or
not
it
is
impossible
in
theory
it
is
surely
a
difficult
problem
in
practice
in
other
words
even
if
enclosure
of
the
arable
commons
always
produced
gains
itself
a
subject
of
debate
enclosure
of
the
information
commons
clearly
has
the
potential
to
harm
innovation
as
well
as
to
support
it
more
property
rights
even
though
they
supposedly
offer
greater
incentives
do
not
necessarily
make
for
more
and
better
production
and
innovation
sometimes
just
the
opposite
is
true
it
may
be
that
intellectual
property
rights
slow
down
innovation
by
putting
multiple
roadblocks
in
the
way
of
subsequent
innovation
using
a
nice
inversion
of
the
idea
of
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
heller
and
eisenberg
referred
to
these
effects
the
transaction
costs
caused
by
myriad
property
rights
over
the
necessary
components
of
some
subsequent
innovation
as
the
tragedy
of
the
anticommons
in
short
even
if
the
enclosure
movement
was
a
complete
success
there
are
important
reasons
to
believe
that
the
intangible
world
is
less
clearly
a
candidate
for
enclosure
that
we
should
pause
study
the
balance
between
the
world
of
the
owned
and
the
world
of
the
free
gather
evidence
after
all
even
in
physical
space
common
property
such
as
roads
increases
the
value
of
the
surrounding
private
tracts
if
there
are
limits
to
the
virtues
of
enclosure
even
there
how
much
more
so
in
a
world
of
intangible
and
nonrival
goods
which
develop
by
drawing
on
prior
creations
yet
the
second
enclosure
movement
proceeds
confidently
nevertheless
with
little
argument
and
less
evidence
to
be
sure
there
is
a
danger
of
overstatement
the
very
fact
that
the
changes
have
been
so
makes
it
hard
to
resist
exaggerating
their
impact
in
justice
brandeis
confidently
claimed
that
t
he
general
rule
of
law
is
that
the
noblest
of
human
productions
knowledge
truths
ascertained
conceptions
and
ideas
become
after
voluntary
communication
to
others
free
as
the
air
to
common
use
that
baseline
intellectual
property
rights
are
the
exception
rather
than
the
norm
ideas
and
facts
must
always
remain
in
the
public
domain
is
still
supposed
to
be
our
starting
point
it
is
however
under
attack
both
overtly
and
covertly
the
commons
of
facts
and
ideas
is
being
enclosed
patents
are
increasingly
stretched
to
cover
ideas
that
twenty
years
ago
all
scholars
would
have
agreed
were
unpatentable
most
troubling
of
all
are
the
attempts
to
introduce
intellectual
property
rights
over
mere
compilations
of
facts
if
intellectual
property
law
had
an
article
of
faith
it
was
that
unoriginal
compilations
of
facts
would
remain
in
the
public
domain
that
this
availability
of
the
raw
material
of
science
and
speech
was
as
important
to
the
next
generation
of
innovation
as
the
intellectual
property
rights
themselves
the
system
would
hand
out
monopolies
in
inventions
and
in
original
expression
while
the
facts
below
and
ideas
above
would
remain
free
for
all
to
build
upon
but
this
premise
is
being
undermined
some
of
the
challenges
are
subtle
in
patent
law
stretched
interpretations
of
novelty
and
nonobviousness
allow
intellectual
property
rights
to
move
closer
and
closer
to
the
underlying
data
layer
gene
sequence
patents
come
very
close
to
being
rights
over
a
particular
discovered
arrangement
of
data
c
g
a
and
t
other
challenges
are
overt
the
european
database
protection
directive
did
and
various
proposed
bills
in
the
united
states
would
create
proprietary
rights
over
compilations
of
facts
often
without
even
the
carefully
framed
exceptions
of
the
copyright
scheme
such
as
the
usefully
protean
category
of
fair
use
the
older
strategy
of
intellectual
property
law
was
a
braided
one
thread
a
thin
layer
of
intellectual
property
rights
around
a
commons
of
material
from
which
future
creators
would
draw
even
that
thin
layer
of
intellectual
property
rights
was
limited
so
as
to
allow
access
to
the
material
when
that
was
necessary
to
further
the
goals
of
the
system
fair
use
allows
for
parody
commentary
and
criticism
and
also
for
decompilation
of
computer
programs
so
that
microsoft
competitors
can
reverse
engineer
word
features
in
order
to
make
sure
their
program
can
convert
word
files
it
may
sound
paradoxical
but
in
a
very
real
sense
protection
of
the
commons
was
one
of
the
fundamental
goals
of
intellectual
property
law
in
the
new
vision
of
intellectual
property
however
property
should
be
extended
everywhere
more
is
better
expanding
patentable
and
copyrightable
subject
matter
lengthening
the
copyright
term
giving
legal
protection
to
digital
barbed
wire
even
if
it
is
used
to
prevent
fair
use
each
of
these
can
be
understood
as
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
the
productive
powers
of
the
commons
we
seem
to
be
shifting
from
assumption
that
the
noblest
of
human
productions
are
free
as
the
air
to
common
use
to
the
assumption
that
any
commons
is
inefficient
if
not
tragic
the
expansion
is
more
than
a
formal
one
it
used
to
be
relatively
hard
to
violate
an
intellectual
property
right
the
technologies
of
reproduction
or
the
activities
necessary
to
infringe
were
largely
though
not
entirely
industrial
imagine
someone
walking
up
to
you
in
handing
you
a
book
or
a
record
or
a
movie
reel
and
saying
quick
do
something
the
law
of
intellectual
property
might
forbid
this
i
admit
is
a
scenario
only
likely
to
come
to
the
mind
of
a
person
in
my
line
of
work
you
would
have
been
to
do
so
perhaps
you
could
find
a
balky
mimeograph
machine
or
press
a
tape
recorder
into
use
you
might
manage
a
single
unauthorized
showing
of
the
movie
though
to
how
many
people
but
triggering
the
law
of
intellectual
property
would
be
genuinely
difficult
like
an
antitank
mine
it
would
not
be
triggered
by
the
footsteps
of
individuals
it
was
reserved
for
bigger
game
this
was
no
accident
the
law
of
intellectual
property
placed
its
triggers
at
the
point
where
commercial
activity
by
competitors
could
undercut
the
exploitation
of
markets
by
the
rights
holder
copying
performance
distribution
these
were
things
done
by
other
industrial
entities
who
were
in
competition
with
the
owner
of
the
rights
other
publishers
movie
theaters
distributors
manufacturers
in
practice
if
not
theory
the
law
was
predominantly
a
form
of
horizontal
industry
regulation
of
unfair
competition
made
by
the
people
in
the
affected
industries
for
the
people
in
the
affected
industries
the
latter
point
is
worth
stressing
congress
would
and
still
does
literally
hand
over
the
lawmaking
process
to
the
industries
involved
telling
them
to
draft
their
contract
in
the
form
of
a
law
and
then
to
return
to
congress
to
have
it
enacted
the
public
was
not
at
the
table
needless
to
say
and
the
assumption
was
that
to
the
extent
there
was
a
public
interest
involved
in
intellectual
property
law
it
was
in
making
sure
that
the
industries
involved
got
their
act
together
so
that
the
flow
of
new
books
and
drugs
and
movies
would
continue
members
of
the
public
in
other
words
were
generally
thought
of
as
passive
consumers
of
finished
products
produced
under
a
form
of
intraindustry
regulation
that
rarely
implicated
any
act
that
an
ordinary
person
would
want
or
be
able
to
engage
in
in
the
world
of
the
these
assumptions
make
some
sense
though
we
might
still
disagree
with
the
definition
of
the
public
interest
it
was
assumed
by
many
that
copyright
need
not
and
probably
should
not
regulate
private
noncommercial
acts
the
person
who
lends
a
book
to
a
friend
or
takes
a
chapter
into
class
is
very
different
from
the
company
with
a
printing
press
that
chooses
to
reproduce
ten
thousand
copies
and
sell
them
the
photocopier
and
the
vcr
make
that
distinction
fuzzier
and
the
networked
computer
threatens
to
erase
it
altogether
so
how
are
things
different
today
if
you
are
a
person
who
routinely
uses
computers
the
internet
or
digital
media
imagine
a
day
when
you
do
not
create
intentionally
and
unintentionally
hundreds
of
temporary
evanescent
copies
if
you
doubt
this
look
in
the
cache
of
your
browser
is
there
a
day
when
you
do
not
distribute
or
retransmit
fragments
of
articles
you
have
read
when
you
do
not
seek
to
share
with
friends
some
image
or
tune
is
there
a
day
when
you
do
not
rework
for
your
job
for
your
class
work
or
simply
for
pastiche
or
fun
some
of
the
digital
material
around
you
in
a
networked
society
copying
is
not
only
easy
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
transmission
storage
caching
and
some
would
claim
even
reading
as
bioinformatics
blurs
the
line
between
computer
modeling
and
biological
research
digital
production
techniques
blur
the
lines
between
listening
editing
and
remaking
rip
mix
and
burn
says
the
apple
advertisement
it
marks
a
world
in
which
the
old
regime
of
intellectual
property
operating
upstream
as
a
form
of
industrial
competition
policy
has
been
replaced
intellectual
property
is
now
in
and
on
the
desktop
and
is
implicated
in
routine
creative
communicative
and
just
plain
consumptive
acts
that
each
of
us
performs
every
day
suddenly
the
triggers
of
copyright
reproduction
distribution
can
be
activated
by
individual
footsteps
of
course
we
would
hope
that
in
your
daily
actions
you
scrupulously
observed
the
rights
all
the
rights
of
the
companies
that
have
interests
in
the
texts
tunes
images
of
celebrities
trademarks
business
method
patents
and
fragments
of
computer
code
you
dealt
with
did
you
can
you
be
sure
i
teach
intellectual
property
but
i
admit
to
some
uncertainty
i
would
not
have
imagined
that
a
temporary
image
of
a
web
page
captured
in
the
cache
of
my
browser
counted
as
a
copy
for
the
purposes
of
copyright
law
i
would
have
thought
that
it
was
fair
use
for
a
company
to
photocopy
articles
in
journals
it
subscribed
to
and
paid
for
in
order
to
circulate
them
to
its
researchers
if
a
conservative
web
site
reposted
news
articles
from
liberal
newspapers
with
critical
commentary
that
too
would
have
seemed
like
fair
use
i
would
have
thought
that
it
was
beneficial
competition
and
not
a
trespass
for
an
electronic
aggregator
to
gather
together
auction
prices
or
airline
fares
so
as
to
give
consumers
more
choice
i
would
not
have
thought
that
a
search
engine
that
catalogued
and
displayed
in
framed
format
the
digital
graphics
found
on
the
internet
would
be
sued
for
infringing
the
copyrights
of
the
owners
of
those
images
i
would
not
have
thought
that
i
might
be
sued
for
violating
intellectual
property
law
if
i
tried
to
compete
with
a
printer
company
by
making
toner
cartridges
that
were
compatible
with
its
printers
the
examples
go
on
i
know
that
the
research
exemption
in
patent
law
is
very
tightly
limited
but
i
would
have
laughed
if
you
had
told
me
that
even
a
research
university
was
forbidden
from
doing
research
unless
that
research
had
no
conceivable
practical
or
academic
worth
in
other
words
that
even
in
academia
in
a
project
with
no
commercial
goal
the
research
exemption
only
covered
research
that
was
completely
pointless
why
have
an
exemption
at
all
in
that
case
i
would
have
told
an
academic
cryptography
researcher
that
he
need
not
fear
legal
threats
from
copyright
owners
simply
for
researching
and
publishing
work
on
the
vulnerabilities
of
copy
protection
schemes
i
would
not
have
thought
that
one
could
patent
the
idea
of
having
an
electronic
dutch
auction
on
the
internet
working
out
the
daily
prices
of
a
bundle
of
mutual
funds
through
simple
arithmetic
or
buying
something
online
with
one
click
i
would
have
assumed
that
celebrities
rights
to
control
their
images
should
end
with
their
deaths
and
that
courts
would
agree
that
those
rights
were
tightly
limited
by
the
first
amendment
yet
in
each
of
these
cases
i
would
have
been
wrong
or
at
least
i
might
be
wrong
enough
that
a
sane
person
would
worry
not
all
of
the
expansive
claims
eventually
triumphed
of
course
but
some
did
guessing
which
would
and
which
would
not
was
hard
even
for
me
though
as
i
said
i
teach
intellectual
property
law
you
probably
do
not
in
none
of
this
would
have
mattered
unless
you
were
in
some
related
business
as
a
publisher
broadcaster
film
distributor
or
what
have
you
it
would
have
been
hard
for
you
to
trigger
the
rules
of
intellectual
property
law
if
you
were
in
such
a
business
you
were
probably
very
familiar
with
the
rules
that
governed
your
activities
and
well
represented
by
corporate
counsel
who
knew
them
even
better
what
more
the
rules
were
neither
as
complex
nor
as
counterintuitive
as
they
are
now
they
also
did
not
reach
as
far
the
reach
of
the
rights
has
been
expanded
and
their
content
made
more
difficult
to
understand
at
the
exact
moment
that
their
practical
effect
has
been
transformed
it
is
not
merely
that
the
triggers
of
intellectual
property
law
can
easily
be
set
off
by
individual
footsteps
there
are
now
many
more
triggers
and
their
trip
wires
are
harder
to
see
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
content
industries
of
course
all
this
is
foolishness
it
is
not
some
undesirable
accident
that
intellectual
property
has
come
to
regulate
personal
noncommercial
activity
it
is
absolutely
necessary
think
of
napster
when
individuals
engaging
in
noncommercial
activity
have
the
ability
to
threaten
the
music
or
film
business
plan
by
engaging
in
the
very
acts
that
copyright
law
always
regulated
namely
reproduction
and
distribution
of
course
it
is
appropriate
for
them
and
the
networks
they
share
on
to
be
subject
to
liability
what
more
to
the
extent
that
copying
becomes
cheaper
and
easier
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
strengthen
intellectual
property
rights
we
must
meet
the
greater
danger
of
copying
with
more
expansive
rights
harsher
penalties
and
expanded
protections
some
of
which
may
indeed
have
the
practical
effect
of
reducing
rights
that
citizens
thought
they
had
such
as
fair
use
noncommercial
sharing
among
personal
friends
resale
and
so
on
without
an
increase
in
private
property
rights
in
other
words
cheaper
copying
will
eat
the
heart
out
of
our
creative
and
cultural
industries
i
call
this
claim
the
internet
threat
chapter
the
internet
threat
the
conventional
wisdom
is
that
governments
respond
slowly
to
technological
change
in
the
case
of
the
internet
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
in
and
was
still
a
mystical
term
for
many
most
stories
about
the
internet
dealt
with
sexual
predation
rather
than
possibilities
of
extreme
wealth
internet
commerce
itself
was
barely
an
idea
and
some
of
the
most
exciting
sites
on
the
web
had
pictures
of
coffeepots
in
university
departments
far
away
see
one
would
proudly
say
to
a
technological
neophyte
friend
when
introducing
him
to
the
wonders
of
the
net
the
pot
is
empty
and
we
can
see
that
live
from
here
this
changes
everything
it
was
an
innocent
time
yet
the
government
was
already
turning
the
wheels
of
intellectual
property
policy
to
respond
to
the
threat
and
promise
of
the
internet
more
precisely
they
were
trying
to
shape
the
future
of
the
cumbersomely
named
national
information
infrastructure
the
official
name
for
the
information
superhighway
that
it
was
presumed
would
replace
the
immature
technology
of
the
net
the
government
was
wrong
about
that
and
about
a
lot
else
the
blueprint
for
new
intellectual
property
policy
online
came
from
the
patent
and
trademark
office
that
office
promulgated
first
a
green
paper
and
then
after
further
hearings
a
white
paper
on
intellectual
property
and
the
national
information
infrastructure
as
policy
and
legal
documents
these
are
in
one
sense
long
out
of
date
some
of
their
legal
arguments
were
successfully
challenged
some
of
their
most
important
proposals
were
rejected
while
many
others
have
become
law
but
as
a
starting
point
from
which
to
trace
the
frame
of
mind
that
has
come
to
dominate
intellectual
property
policy
online
they
are
hard
to
equal
these
documents
contained
proposals
that
nowadays
would
be
seen
as
fairly
controversial
internet
service
providers
were
said
to
be
strictly
liable
for
copyright
violations
committed
by
their
subscribers
that
is
to
say
they
were
legally
responsible
whether
or
not
they
knew
about
the
violation
or
were
at
fault
in
any
way
loading
a
document
into
your
browser
transient
cache
memory
while
reading
it
was
said
to
be
making
a
copy
there
was
more
the
beginnings
of
what
later
became
the
digital
millennium
copyright
making
it
illegal
to
cut
through
the
digital
fences
which
content
providers
put
around
their
products
the
attitude
toward
fair
use
was
particularly
revealing
at
one
point
in
the
white
paper
it
was
hinted
that
fair
use
might
be
a
relic
of
the
inconveniences
of
the
analog
age
to
be
discarded
now
that
we
could
have
automated
fractional
payments
for
even
the
most
insignificant
it
was
noted
however
that
some
disagreed
with
this
conclusion
at
another
point
fair
use
was
described
as
a
tax
on
rights
holders
and
a
subsidy
to
those
who
benefited
from
it
such
as
educational
the
white
paper
also
suggested
that
while
any
potential
loss
to
rights
holders
caused
by
the
new
technology
needed
to
be
countered
with
new
rights
and
new
protections
any
potential
gain
to
them
through
the
new
technology
was
simply
theirs
potential
gain
did
not
offset
the
need
to
compensate
for
potential
loss
so
what
views
of
intellectual
property
were
we
carrying
forward
into
the
internet
age
intellectual
property
is
just
like
other
property
rights
are
presumptively
absolute
any
limitations
on
them
such
as
fair
use
are
taxes
on
property
owners
subsidies
to
the
society
at
large
it
sounds
like
a
perfect
time
to
administer
the
jefferson
warning
i
sketched
out
in
chapter
after
all
jefferson
was
specifically
warning
against
each
of
these
errors
two
hundred
years
ago
to
find
them
in
a
student
paper
would
be
disappointing
irritating
even
but
this
document
was
the
blueprint
for
the
intellectual
property
regime
of
cyberspace
but
do
these
mistakes
matter
how
important
is
it
that
we
get
the
rules
of
intellectual
property
right
to
me
a
number
of
my
colleagues
some
librarians
a
few
software
gurus
the
white
paper
was
more
than
just
a
bit
of
bad
policy
in
a
technical
field
like
a
poorly
drafted
statute
about
the
witnessing
of
wills
say
when
you
set
up
the
property
rules
in
some
new
space
you
determine
much
about
the
history
that
follows
property
rules
have
a
huge
effect
on
power
relationships
and
bargaining
positions
think
of
rules
setting
out
water
rights
or
the
right
to
drive
cattle
over
homesteaders
land
in
the
american
west
but
they
also
are
part
of
a
larger
way
of
seeing
the
world
think
of
the
rules
treating
unions
as
conspiracies
in
restraint
of
trade
or
the
supreme
court
decisions
that
dispossessed
the
american
indians
on
the
theory
that
they
did
not
comprehend
the
concept
of
property
and
thus
did
not
own
the
land
being
taken
from
we
were
at
a
comparable
point
in
the
history
of
cyberspace
what
was
being
set
up
here
was
a
vision
of
economy
and
culture
a
frame
of
mind
about
how
the
world
of
cultural
exchange
operates
and
eventually
a
blueprint
for
our
systems
of
communication
at
this
stage
the
range
of
possibilities
is
extremely
wide
a
lot
of
different
choices
could
be
made
but
subsequent
changes
would
be
harder
and
harder
as
people
and
companies
built
their
activities
around
the
rules
that
had
been
laid
down
this
was
in
short
a
tipping
point
where
it
was
particularly
important
that
we
make
the
right
decisions
conventional
political
science
told
us
there
were
a
lot
of
reasons
to
fear
that
we
would
not
make
the
right
decisions
the
political
process
was
going
to
be
particularly
vulnerable
to
problems
of
capture
by
established
industries
many
of
whom
would
rightly
see
the
internet
as
a
potential
threat
to
their
role
as
intermediaries
between
artists
and
creators
on
the
one
hand
and
the
public
on
the
other
intellectual
property
legislation
had
always
been
a
cozy
world
in
which
the
content
publishing
and
distribution
industries
were
literally
asked
to
draft
the
rules
by
which
they
would
live
the
law
was
treated
as
a
kind
of
contract
between
the
affected
industries
rationally
enough
those
industries
would
wish
to
use
the
law
not
merely
to
protect
their
legitimate
existing
property
rights
but
to
make
challenges
to
their
basic
business
plans
illegal
imagine
what
would
have
happened
if
we
had
given
the
sellers
the
right
to
define
the
rules
under
which
the
newfangled
electric
light
companies
would
operate
there
would
be
no
easy
counterweight
to
these
pressures
as
jessica
litman
points
out
in
a
wonderful
set
of
reflections
on
copyright
lawmaking
because
the
potential
competitors
to
existing
titans
were
just
being
born
and
could
thus
be
strangled
safely
in
their
certainly
the
public
would
have
little
grasp
as
yet
of
what
was
at
stake
in
any
event
when
had
the
public
played
a
role
in
intellectual
property
legislation
that
kind
of
law
affected
businesses
with
printing
presses
or
tv
towers
not
normal
citizens
it
did
not
help
that
the
legislators
were
largely
both
ignorant
and
distrustful
of
the
technology
of
the
internet
which
was
at
the
time
thought
to
be
dominated
by
foreign
hackers
suicidal
cults
pirates
and
sleazy
pornographers
terrorists
and
nigerian
spammers
would
be
added
to
the
mix
later
given
an
area
of
law
that
legislators
were
happy
to
hand
over
to
the
affected
industries
and
a
technology
that
was
both
unfamiliar
and
threatening
the
prospects
for
legislative
insight
were
poor
lawmakers
were
assured
by
lobbyists
a
that
this
was
business
as
usual
that
no
dramatic
changes
were
being
made
by
the
green
or
white
papers
or
b
that
the
technology
presented
a
terrible
menace
to
the
american
cultural
industries
but
that
prompt
and
statesmanlike
action
would
save
the
day
or
c
that
layers
of
new
property
rights
new
private
enforcers
of
those
rights
and
technological
control
and
surveillance
measures
were
all
needed
in
order
to
benefit
consumers
who
would
now
be
able
to
purchase
culture
by
the
sip
rather
than
by
the
glass
in
a
pervasively
monitored
digital
environment
in
practice
somewhat
confusingly
these
three
arguments
would
often
be
combined
legislators
statements
seemed
to
suggest
that
this
was
a
routine
armageddon
in
which
firm
decisive
statesmanship
was
needed
to
preserve
the
digital
status
quo
in
a
profoundly
transformative
and
proconsumer
way
reading
the
congressional
debates
was
likely
to
give
one
conceptual
whiplash
to
make
things
worse
the
press
was
in
at
least
clueless
about
these
issues
it
was
not
that
the
newspapers
were
ignoring
the
internet
they
were
paying
attention
obsessive
attention
in
some
cases
but
as
far
as
the
mainstream
press
was
concerned
the
story
line
on
the
internet
was
sex
pornography
online
predation
more
pornography
the
lowbrow
press
stopped
there
to
be
fair
the
highbrow
press
was
also
interested
in
internet
legal
issues
the
regulation
of
pornography
the
regulation
of
online
predation
and
constitutional
questions
the
first
amendment
protection
of
internet
pornography
reporters
were
also
asking
questions
about
the
social
effect
of
the
network
including
among
other
things
the
threats
posed
by
pornography
and
online
predators
there
were
certainly
important
issues
within
the
areas
the
press
was
willing
to
focus
on
and
i
do
not
mean
to
trivialize
them
i
worked
with
a
couple
of
civil
liberties
groups
in
opposing
the
hapless
communications
decency
act
one
of
the
most
poorly
drafted
pieces
of
speech
regulation
ever
to
come
out
of
it
was
a
palpably
unconstitutional
statute
eventually
struck
down
by
a
unanimous
supreme
its
proposals
would
have
burdened
the
speech
of
adults
while
failing
to
protect
the
interests
of
minors
reporters
loved
the
topic
of
the
communications
decency
act
it
was
about
sex
technology
and
the
first
amendment
it
foreshadowed
the
future
of
online
speech
regulation
one
could
write
about
it
while
feeling
simultaneously
prurient
principled
and
prescient
the
journalistic
trifecta
for
law
professors
who
worked
on
digital
issues
the
communications
decency
act
was
an
easy
topic
to
get
the
public
to
focus
on
we
had
the
reporters
and
editors
calling
us
pleading
for
a
quote
or
an
opinion
piece
intellectual
property
was
something
quite
different
it
was
occasionally
covered
in
the
business
pages
with
the
same
enthusiasm
devoted
to
changes
in
derivatives
rules
presented
with
the
proposals
in
the
green
and
white
papers
the
reporters
went
looking
for
opinions
from
the
software
publishers
association
the
recording
industry
association
of
america
or
the
motion
picture
association
of
america
this
was
not
bias
or
laziness
to
whom
else
would
they
go
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
these
issues
remember
all
of
this
occurred
before
napster
was
a
gleam
in
sean
fanning
eye
sean
fanning
was
in
middle
school
was
a
new
company
and
google
was
not
yet
a
verb
in
this
environment
convincing
the
legislature
or
the
press
that
fundamental
public
choices
were
implicated
in
the
design
of
intellectual
property
rights
for
the
digital
world
was
about
as
easy
as
convincing
them
that
fundamental
public
choices
were
implicated
in
the
rules
of
tiddlywinks
my
own
experience
is
probably
representative
i
remember
trying
to
pitch
an
article
on
the
subject
to
a
charming
but
uncomprehending
opinion
page
editor
at
the
washington
post
i
tried
to
explain
that
decisions
about
property
rules
would
shape
the
way
we
thought
about
the
technology
would
the
relatively
anonymous
and
decentralized
characteristics
of
the
internet
that
made
it
such
a
powerful
tool
for
global
speech
and
debate
come
to
be
seen
as
a
bug
rather
than
a
feature
something
to
be
fixed
to
make
the
net
safe
for
protected
content
the
rules
would
also
shape
the
economic
interests
that
drove
future
policy
would
we
try
to
build
the
system
around
the
model
of
proprietary
content
dispensed
in
tightly
controlled
chunks
would
fair
use
be
made
technologically
obsolescent
would
we
undercut
the
various
nontraditional
methods
of
innovation
such
as
free
software
before
they
ever
managed
to
establish
themselves
what
would
become
of
libraries
in
the
digital
world
of
the
ideal
that
access
to
books
had
important
differences
from
access
to
twinkies
after
i
concluded
this
lengthy
and
slightly
incoherent
cri
de
coeur
there
was
a
long
pause
then
the
editor
said
politely
are
you
sure
you
could
make
some
of
these
points
about
a
free
speech
issue
like
the
communications
decency
act
maybe
i
finally
placed
the
piece
in
the
washington
which
was
best
known
at
the
time
as
the
only
metropolitan
newspaper
owned
by
the
unification
church
familiarly
referred
to
as
the
moonies
this
hardly
counted
as
a
direct
line
to
the
popular
imagination
though
the
article
mild
criticisms
elicited
an
extraordinary
reaction
from
the
clinton
administration
lead
official
on
intellectual
property
policy
throwing
me
for
several
weeks
into
a
surreal
world
of
secondhand
threats
leaks
and
a
hilarious
in
the
letters
page
things
were
not
completely
an
unlikely
group
of
critics
had
formed
librarians
a
few
software
developers
law
professors
some
internet
libertarians
of
particular
note
was
the
digital
future
coalition
which
grew
to
represent
a
broad
range
of
interested
groups
and
industries
thanks
in
part
to
the
prescient
analysis
and
remarkable
energy
of
one
of
my
colleagues
peter
together
with
pamela
samuelson
jessica
litman
and
a
number
of
other
distinguished
legal
scholars
peter
turned
his
considerable
intellectual
talents
to
explaining
why
writers
telecom
companies
scientists
manufacturers
of
consumer
electronics
and
a
host
of
other
groups
should
be
interested
in
the
rules
being
debated
there
had
been
a
series
of
official
hearings
in
which
complaints
were
carefully
collected
and
just
as
carefully
ignored
this
became
harder
to
do
as
the
critics
became
more
numerous
and
better
organized
nevertheless
the
currents
were
clearly
running
against
them
it
would
be
nice
to
say
that
this
was
merely
because
of
the
clubby
history
of
intellectual
property
legislation
or
the
difficulty
in
getting
press
attention
or
the
various
issues
of
industry
capture
and
collective
action
problems
yet
this
would
be
to
miss
a
vital
element
of
the
situation
conventional
political
science
showed
that
there
were
structural
reasons
why
the
legislative
process
was
likely
to
succumb
to
industry
the
reality
turned
out
to
be
much
worse
the
real
problem
was
not
a
political
process
dominated
by
cynical
power
politics
nor
an
initial
absence
of
critical
newspaper
coverage
though
both
of
those
factors
contributed
the
real
problem
was
that
most
of
the
proponents
of
the
white
policies
believed
their
own
arguments
so
deeply
and
sincerely
that
they
saw
any
criticism
of
those
positions
as
either
godless
communism
or
hippy
digital
anarchism
frequently
in
fact
they
clung
to
their
arguments
even
when
there
was
fairly
strong
evidence
that
they
would
actually
be
harming
themselves
by
putting
these
policies
into
effect
i
will
expand
on
this
point
later
more
importantly
they
succeeded
in
getting
their
story
about
the
threats
and
promises
of
the
digital
future
accepted
as
the
basis
for
all
discussion
of
intellectual
property
policy
it
became
the
organizing
set
of
principles
the
master
narrative
call
it
what
you
will
the
heart
of
the
story
is
beguilingly
simple
the
internet
makes
copying
cheaper
and
does
so
on
an
unparalleled
global
scale
therefore
we
must
meet
the
greater
danger
of
illicit
copying
with
more
expansive
rights
harsher
penalties
and
expanded
protections
true
as
i
pointed
out
before
some
of
these
expansions
may
indeed
have
the
practical
effect
of
reducing
rights
that
citizens
thought
they
had
such
as
fair
use
level
noncommercial
sharing
among
personal
friends
resale
and
so
on
but
without
an
increase
in
private
property
rights
cheaper
copying
will
eat
the
heart
out
of
our
creative
and
cultural
industries
i
call
this
story
the
internet
threat
it
is
a
powerful
argument
and
it
deserves
some
explanation
think
back
for
a
moment
to
the
first
chapter
and
the
difference
between
madame
bovary
and
the
petunia
if
the
reason
for
intellectual
property
rights
is
the
nonrival
and
nonexcludable
nature
of
the
goods
they
protect
then
surely
the
lowering
of
copying
and
transmission
costs
implies
a
corresponding
need
to
increase
the
strength
of
intellectual
property
rights
imagine
a
line
at
one
end
sits
a
monk
painstakingly
transcribing
aristotle
poetics
in
the
middle
lies
the
gutenberg
printing
press
of
the
way
along
the
line
is
a
photocopying
machine
at
the
far
end
lies
the
internet
and
the
online
version
of
the
human
genome
at
each
stage
copying
costs
are
lowered
and
goods
become
both
less
rival
and
less
excludable
my
files
are
available
to
anyone
in
the
world
running
napster
songs
can
be
found
and
copied
with
ease
the
symbolic
end
of
rivalry
comes
when
i
am
playing
the
song
in
chapel
hill
north
carolina
at
the
very
moment
that
you
are
both
downloading
and
listening
to
it
in
kazakhstan
now
that
is
nonrival
the
logic
of
perfect
control
my
point
is
that
there
is
a
teleology
a
theory
about
how
intellectual
property
law
must
develop
historically
hidden
inside
the
argument
i
call
the
internet
threat
the
argument
which
is
touted
endlessly
by
the
content
industries
and
not
without
reason
can
be
reduced
to
this
the
strength
of
intellectual
property
rights
must
vary
inversely
with
the
cost
of
copying
with
high
copying
costs
one
needs
weak
intellectual
property
rights
if
any
at
all
to
deal
with
the
we
need
no
copyright
because
physical
control
of
the
manuscript
is
enough
what
does
it
matter
if
i
say
i
will
copy
your
manuscript
if
i
must
do
it
by
hand
how
will
this
present
a
threat
to
you
there
is
no
need
to
create
a
legal
right
to
exclude
others
from
copying
no
need
for
a
copy
right
as
copying
costs
fall
however
the
need
to
exclude
increases
to
deal
with
the
gutenberg
press
we
need
the
statute
of
anne
the
first
copyright
statute
and
the
long
evolution
of
copyright
it
ushered
in
but
then
comes
the
internet
to
deal
with
the
internet
we
need
the
digital
millennium
copyright
the
no
electronic
theft
the
sonny
bono
copyright
term
extension
and
perhaps
even
the
collections
of
information
antipiracy
as
copying
costs
approach
zero
intellectual
property
rights
must
approach
perfect
control
we
must
strengthen
the
rights
lengthen
the
term
of
the
rights
increase
the
penalties
and
make
noncommercial
illicit
copying
a
crime
we
must
move
outside
the
traditional
realm
of
copyright
altogether
to
regulate
the
technology
around
the
copyrighted
material
companies
are
surrounding
their
digital
materials
with
digital
fences
we
must
make
it
a
violation
of
the
law
to
cut
those
digital
fences
even
if
you
do
so
to
make
a
fair
use
of
the
material
on
the
other
side
we
must
prohibit
the
making
of
things
that
can
be
used
as
a
prospect
that
worries
researchers
on
encryption
in
the
long
run
we
must
get
rid
of
the
troublesome
anonymity
of
the
internet
requiring
each
computer
to
have
an
individual
id
we
must
make
contracts
enforceable
even
on
third
parties
even
when
you
can
not
read
them
before
clicking
so
that
you
never
actually
buy
the
software
music
movies
and
you
download
merely
license
them
for
a
narrowly
defined
range
of
uses
we
must
create
interlocking
software
and
hardware
systems
that
monitor
and
control
the
material
played
on
those
systems
so
that
songs
can
be
licensed
to
particular
computers
at
particular
times
uses
that
the
owners
wish
to
forbid
will
actually
be
impossible
whether
they
are
legal
or
not
in
other
words
we
must
make
this
technology
of
the
internet
which
was
hailed
as
the
great
technology
of
freedom
into
a
technology
of
control
and
surveillance
the
possibility
of
individuals
circulating
costless
perfect
digital
copies
requires
it
it
would
be
facile
if
tempting
to
say
we
must
remake
the
internet
to
make
it
safe
for
britney
spears
the
internet
threat
argument
is
that
we
must
remake
the
net
if
we
want
digital
creativity
whether
in
music
or
software
or
movies
or
texts
and
since
the
strength
of
the
property
rights
varies
inversely
with
the
cost
of
copying
costless
copying
means
that
the
remade
net
must
approach
perfect
control
both
in
its
legal
regime
and
its
technical
architecture
like
any
attractive
but
misleading
argument
the
internet
threat
has
a
lot
of
truth
ask
the
software
company
producing
expensive
specialized
design
programs
costing
thousands
of
dollars
what
happens
when
the
program
is
made
available
on
a
warez
site
or
a
filesharing
network
the
upstart
computer
game
company
pinning
its
hopes
and
its
capital
on
a
single
new
game
would
tell
you
the
same
thing
the
easy
availability
of
perfect
costless
copies
is
a
danger
to
all
kinds
of
valuable
cultural
and
economic
production
the
story
of
the
internet
threat
is
not
wrong
it
is
simply
dramatically
incomplete
in
lots
of
ways
here
are
two
of
them
costless
copying
brings
both
costs
and
benefits
the
internet
does
lower
the
cost
of
copying
and
thus
the
cost
of
illicit
copying
of
course
it
also
lowers
the
costs
of
production
distribution
and
advertising
and
dramatically
increases
the
size
of
the
potential
market
is
the
net
result
a
loss
to
rights
holders
such
that
we
need
to
increase
protection
and
control
in
order
to
maintain
a
constant
level
of
incentives
a
large
leaky
market
may
actually
provide
more
revenue
than
a
small
one
over
which
one
control
is
much
stronger
more
the
same
technologies
that
allow
for
cheap
copying
also
allow
for
swift
and
encyclopedic
search
engines
the
best
devices
ever
invented
for
detecting
illicit
copying
what
the
net
takes
away
with
one
hand
it
often
gives
back
with
the
other
cheaper
copying
does
not
merely
mean
loss
it
also
means
opportunity
before
strengthening
intellectual
property
rights
we
would
need
to
know
whether
the
loss
was
greater
than
the
gain
and
whether
revised
business
models
and
new
distribution
mechanisms
could
avoid
the
losses
while
capturing
more
of
the
gains
but
wait
surely
theft
is
theft
if
the
new
technologies
enable
more
theft
of
intellectual
property
must
we
not
strengthen
the
laws
in
order
to
deal
with
the
problem
if
some
new
technology
led
to
a
rash
of
car
thefts
we
might
increase
police
resources
and
prison
sentences
perhaps
pass
new
legislation
creating
new
crimes
related
to
car
theft
we
would
do
all
of
this
even
if
the
technology
in
question
gave
car
owners
significant
benefits
elsewhere
theft
is
theft
is
it
not
the
answer
in
a
word
is
no
saying
theft
is
theft
is
exactly
the
error
that
the
jefferson
warning
is
supposed
to
guard
against
we
should
not
assume
that
intellectual
property
and
material
property
are
the
same
in
all
regards
the
goal
of
creating
the
limited
monopoly
called
an
intellectual
property
right
is
to
provide
the
minimum
necessary
incentive
to
encourage
the
desired
level
of
innovation
anything
extra
is
deadweight
loss
when
someone
takes
your
car
they
have
the
car
and
you
do
not
when
because
of
some
new
technology
someone
is
able
to
get
access
to
the
file
of
your
new
song
they
have
the
file
and
so
do
you
you
did
not
lose
the
song
what
you
may
have
lost
is
the
opportunity
to
sell
the
song
to
that
person
or
to
the
people
with
whom
they
share
the
file
we
should
not
be
indifferent
to
this
kind
of
loss
it
is
a
serious
concern
but
the
fact
that
a
new
technology
brings
economic
benefits
as
well
as
economic
harm
to
the
creation
distribution
and
sale
of
intellectual
property
products
means
that
we
should
pause
before
increasing
the
level
of
rights
changing
the
architecture
of
our
communications
networks
creating
new
crimes
and
so
on
remember
many
of
the
things
that
the
content
industries
were
concerned
about
on
the
internet
were
already
illegal
already
subject
to
suit
and
prosecution
the
question
is
not
whether
the
internet
should
be
an
intellectual
zone
it
should
not
be
is
not
and
never
was
the
question
is
whether
when
the
content
industries
come
asking
for
additional
or
new
rights
for
new
penalties
for
the
criminalization
of
certain
types
of
technology
we
should
take
into
account
the
gains
that
the
internet
has
brought
them
as
well
as
the
costs
before
we
accede
to
their
requests
the
answer
of
course
is
that
we
should
sadly
we
did
not
this
does
not
mean
that
all
of
the
content
industries
attempts
to
strengthen
the
law
are
wrong
and
unnecessary
it
means
that
we
do
not
know
whether
they
are
or
not
there
is
a
fairly
solid
tradition
in
intellectual
property
policy
of
what
i
call
downside
vision
all
of
the
threats
posed
by
any
new
technology
the
player
piano
the
jukebox
the
photocopier
the
vcr
the
internet
are
seen
with
extraordinary
clarity
the
opportunities
however
particularly
those
which
involve
changing
a
business
model
or
restructuring
a
market
are
dismissed
as
phantoms
the
downside
dominates
the
field
the
upside
is
invisible
the
story
of
video
recorders
is
the
example
when
video
recorders
another
technology
promising
cheaper
copying
first
appeared
the
reaction
of
movie
studios
was
one
of
horror
their
business
plans
relied
upon
showing
movies
in
theaters
and
then
licensing
them
to
television
stations
vcrs
and
betamaxes
fit
nowhere
in
this
plan
they
were
seen
merely
as
copyright
violation
devices
hollywood
tried
to
have
them
taxed
to
pay
for
the
losses
that
would
be
caused
their
assumption
cheaper
copying
demands
stronger
rights
having
lost
that
battle
the
movie
studios
tried
to
have
the
manufacturers
of
the
recording
devices
found
liable
for
contributory
copyright
infringement
liable
in
other
words
for
assisting
the
copyright
violations
that
could
be
carried
out
by
the
owners
of
sony
betamaxes
this
of
course
was
exactly
the
same
legal
claim
that
would
be
made
in
the
napster
case
in
the
sony
case
however
the
movie
companies
lost
the
supreme
court
said
that
recording
of
tv
programs
to
them
to
a
more
convenient
hour
was
a
fair
the
movie
studios
claims
were
rejected
freed
from
the
threat
of
liability
the
price
of
video
recorders
continued
to
fall
they
flooded
consumers
houses
at
a
speed
unparalleled
until
the
arrival
of
the
world
wide
web
all
these
boxes
sitting
by
tvs
now
cried
out
for
content
content
that
was
provided
by
an
emerging
video
rental
market
until
the
triumph
of
dvds
the
videocassette
rental
market
made
up
more
than
percent
of
the
movie
industry
were
losses
caused
by
video
recorders
to
be
sure
some
people
who
might
have
gone
to
see
a
movie
in
a
theater
because
the
tv
schedule
was
inconvenient
could
instead
record
the
show
and
watch
it
later
videos
could
even
be
shared
with
friends
and
families
tattered
copies
of
disney
movies
recorded
from
some
cable
show
could
be
passed
on
to
siblings
whose
kids
have
reached
the
appropriate
age
vcrs
were
also
used
for
copying
that
was
clearly
illicit
duplication
and
sale
of
movies
by
someone
other
than
the
rights
holder
a
cheaper
copying
technology
definitely
caused
losses
but
it
also
provided
substantial
gains
gains
that
far
outweighed
the
losses
ironically
had
the
movie
companies
won
in
the
sony
case
they
might
now
be
worse
off
the
sony
story
provides
us
with
some
useful
lessons
first
this
downside
vision
is
a
poor
guide
to
copyright
policy
under
its
sway
some
companies
will
invariably
equate
greater
control
with
profit
and
cheaper
copying
with
loss
they
will
conclude
sometimes
rightly
that
their
very
existence
is
threatened
and
sometimes
wrongly
that
the
threat
is
to
innovation
and
culture
itself
rather
than
to
their
particular
way
of
delivering
it
they
will
turn
to
the
legislature
and
the
courts
for
guarantees
that
they
can
go
on
doing
business
in
the
old
familiar
ways
normally
the
marketplace
is
supposed
to
provide
correctives
to
this
kind
of
myopia
upstart
companies
not
bound
by
the
habits
of
the
last
generation
are
supposed
to
move
nimbly
to
harvest
the
benefits
from
the
new
technology
and
to
outcompete
the
lumbering
dinosaurs
in
certain
situations
though
competition
will
not
work
if
the
dinosaurs
are
a
cartel
strong
enough
to
squelch
competition
if
they
have
enlisted
the
state
to
make
the
threatening
technology
illegal
describing
it
as
a
predatory
encroachment
on
the
rights
of
the
old
guard
rather
than
aggressive
competition
if
ingrained
prejudices
are
simply
so
strong
that
the
potential
business
benefits
take
years
to
become
apparent
or
if
the
market
has
locked
in
on
a
dominant
standard
a
technology
or
an
operating
system
say
to
which
new
market
entrants
do
not
have
legal
access
in
those
situations
markets
can
not
be
counted
on
to
correct
unfortunately
and
this
is
a
key
point
intellectual
property
policy
frequently
deals
with
controversies
in
which
all
of
these
conditions
hold
true
let
me
repeat
this
point
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
ones
in
this
book
to
a
political
scientist
or
market
analyst
the
conditions
i
have
just
described
sound
like
a
rarely
seen
perfect
storm
of
legislative
and
market
dysfunction
to
an
intellectual
property
scholar
they
sound
like
business
as
usual
in
the
case
of
the
vcr
wars
none
of
these
factors
obtained
the
state
refused
to
step
in
to
aid
the
movie
companies
by
criminalizing
the
new
technology
there
were
equally
powerful
companies
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue
the
consumer
electronics
companies
selling
vcrs
who
saw
this
new
market
as
a
natural
extension
of
a
familiar
existing
market
audio
recorders
there
was
no
dominant
proprietary
technological
standard
controlled
by
the
threatened
industry
that
could
be
used
to
shut
down
any
threats
to
their
business
model
the
market
was
allowed
to
develop
and
evolve
without
premature
legal
intervention
or
proprietary
technological
lockout
thus
we
know
in
this
case
that
the
movie
companies
were
wrong
that
their
claims
of
impending
doom
from
cheap
copies
were
completely
mistaken
the
public
and
ironically
the
industry
itself
benefited
as
a
result
but
the
sony
case
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
that
is
why
it
is
so
important
if
competition
and
change
can
be
forbidden
we
will
get
relatively
few
cases
that
disprove
the
logic
that
cheaper
copying
must
always
mean
stronger
rights
the
natural
experiments
will
never
be
allowed
to
happen
they
will
be
squelched
by
those
who
see
only
threat
in
the
technologies
that
allow
cheaper
copies
and
who
can
persuade
legislators
or
judges
to
see
the
world
their
way
the
story
line
i
describe
here
the
internet
threat
will
become
the
conventional
wisdom
in
the
process
it
will
make
it
much
less
likely
that
we
will
have
the
evidence
needed
to
refute
it
the
holes
matter
as
much
as
the
cheese
the
sony
case
is
important
in
another
way
the
supreme
decision
turned
on
the
judgment
that
it
was
a
fair
use
under
copyright
law
for
consumers
to
record
television
programs
for
purposes
since
fair
use
comes
up
numerous
times
in
this
book
it
is
worth
pausing
for
a
moment
to
explain
what
it
is
the
content
industries
like
to
portray
fair
use
as
a
narrow
and
grudging
defense
against
an
otherwise
valid
case
for
copyright
infringement
as
if
the
claim
were
yes
i
trespassed
on
your
land
which
was
wrong
i
admit
but
i
was
starving
and
looking
for
food
please
give
me
a
break
this
is
simply
inaccurate
true
fair
use
is
asserted
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
is
the
way
it
is
brought
up
in
a
copyright
case
but
in
law
fair
uses
are
stated
quite
clearly
to
be
limitations
on
the
exclusive
rights
of
the
copyright
holder
uses
that
were
never
within
the
copyright
holder
power
to
prohibit
the
defense
is
not
i
trespassed
on
your
land
but
i
was
starving
it
is
i
did
not
trespass
on
your
land
i
walked
on
the
public
road
that
runs
through
it
a
road
you
never
owned
in
the
first
place
when
society
hands
out
the
right
to
the
copyright
holder
it
carves
out
certain
areas
of
use
and
refuses
to
hand
over
control
of
them
again
remember
the
jefferson
warning
this
is
not
a
presumptively
absolute
property
right
it
is
a
conditional
grant
of
a
limited
and
temporary
monopoly
one
can
not
start
from
the
presumption
that
the
rights
holder
has
absolute
rights
over
all
possible
uses
and
therefore
that
any
time
a
citizen
makes
use
of
the
work
in
any
way
the
rights
holder
is
entitled
to
get
paid
or
to
claim
piracy
if
he
does
not
get
paid
under
the
sway
of
the
story
line
i
called
the
internet
threat
legislators
have
lost
sight
of
this
point
so
what
is
fair
use
when
i
am
asked
this
question
by
nonlawyers
i
offer
to
show
them
the
actual
provision
in
the
copyright
act
they
recoil
clearly
imagining
they
are
about
to
be
shown
something
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
tax
code
here
is
the
statutory
fair
use
provision
in
its
entirety
sec
limitations
on
exclusive
rights
fair
use
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
sections
and
the
fair
use
of
a
copyrighted
work
including
such
use
by
reproduction
in
copies
or
phonorecords
or
by
any
other
means
specified
by
that
section
for
purposes
such
as
criticism
comment
news
reporting
teaching
including
multiple
copies
for
classroom
use
scholarship
or
research
is
not
an
infringement
of
copyright
in
determining
whether
the
use
made
of
a
work
in
any
particular
case
is
a
fair
use
the
factors
to
be
considered
shall
include
the
purpose
and
character
of
the
use
including
whether
such
use
is
of
a
commercial
nature
or
is
for
nonprofit
educational
purposes
the
nature
of
the
copyrighted
work
the
amount
and
substantiality
of
the
portion
used
in
relation
to
the
copyrighted
work
as
a
whole
and
the
effect
of
the
use
upon
the
potential
market
for
or
value
of
the
copyrighted
work
the
fact
that
a
work
is
unpublished
shall
not
itself
bar
a
finding
of
fair
use
if
such
finding
is
made
upon
consideration
of
all
the
above
factors
but
this
seems
quite
sensible
people
often
say
as
though
they
had
expected
both
byzantine
complexity
and
manifest
irrationality
perhaps
they
have
had
some
experience
with
legal
matters
after
all
the
ones
who
think
about
it
a
little
longer
realize
that
these
factors
can
not
be
mechanically
applied
look
at
factor
for
example
someone
who
is
making
a
parody
frequently
needs
to
take
large
chunks
of
the
parodied
work
that
is
the
nature
of
a
parody
after
all
they
might
then
sell
the
parody
thus
also
getting
into
trouble
with
factor
and
what
about
factor
someone
might
quote
big
chunks
of
my
book
in
a
devastating
review
that
ruined
any
chance
the
book
had
of
selling
well
come
to
think
of
it
even
a
parody
might
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
potential
market
for
the
parodied
work
but
surely
those
uses
would
still
be
fair
in
both
instances
the
supreme
court
agrees
that
they
are
fair
uses
in
coming
up
with
these
hypothetical
problem
cases
the
copyright
novice
is
probably
closer
to
having
a
good
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
fair
use
than
many
people
who
have
studied
it
for
years
in
fact
the
novice
questions
shed
light
on
all
of
the
exceptions
limitations
and
defenses
to
proprietary
rights
the
holes
in
the
cheese
of
intellectual
property
the
scholar
urge
is
to
find
one
theory
that
explains
all
the
possible
applications
of
the
fair
use
doctrine
to
arrange
all
of
the
cases
like
targets
and
shoot
a
single
arrow
through
all
of
them
perhaps
fair
use
is
designed
to
reduce
the
difficulty
of
clearing
rights
when
it
would
be
uneconomical
or
impossibly
complex
to
do
so
to
reduce
the
paperwork
hassle
delay
ignorance
and
aggravation
that
economists
refer
to
under
the
sanguine
name
of
transaction
costs
though
the
idea
that
fair
use
is
about
transaction
costs
hardly
explains
some
of
the
types
of
fair
use
we
care
most
about
the
rights
to
parody
to
criticize
to
reverse
engineer
or
perhaps
fair
use
allows
the
rights
of
a
transformative
author
to
be
trumped
only
by
a
second
transformative
author
who
is
building
on
the
first
the
parodist
reviewer
collage
artist
or
what
have
then
again
photocopying
for
classroom
use
does
not
sound
very
transformative
could
fair
use
be
dictated
by
the
constitution
or
by
international
free
speech
guarantees
in
this
view
fair
use
provides
a
safety
valve
that
allows
copyright
to
coexist
with
the
first
amendment
property
rights
over
speech
to
coexist
with
freedom
of
after
all
it
is
not
entirely
obvious
how
it
could
be
constitutional
to
forbid
me
in
the
name
of
a
federal
law
from
translating
mein
kampf
in
order
to
warn
of
the
dangers
of
fascism
or
parodying
some
piece
of
art
to
subversive
effect
each
of
these
ideas
about
fair
use
has
much
to
recommend
it
as
do
the
many
other
grand
theories
that
have
been
offered
to
explain
the
puzzle
and
therein
lies
the
problem
intellectual
property
is
a
brilliant
social
invention
which
presents
us
with
great
benefits
but
also
with
a
multitude
of
dangers
the
danger
that
the
monopoly
is
unnecessary
to
produce
the
innovation
or
that
it
is
broader
or
lasts
for
longer
than
is
necessary
to
encourage
future
production
that
overly
broad
rights
will
chill
speech
criticism
or
scientific
progress
that
it
will
restrict
access
in
ways
that
discourage
on
innovation
that
it
will
lead
to
industry
concentration
in
a
way
that
hurts
consumers
or
citizens
while
being
less
subject
to
antitrust
regulation
precisely
because
the
monopoly
or
oligopoly
rests
on
intellectual
property
rights
that
it
will
establish
strong
network
effects
which
cause
the
market
to
tip
over
to
some
inefficient
technology
and
that
it
will
give
the
rights
holder
control
over
some
technology
outside
the
range
of
the
monopoly
but
closely
linked
to
it
the
list
of
dangers
goes
on
and
on
and
so
does
the
list
of
exceptions
limitations
and
restraints
designed
to
prevent
them
we
restrict
the
length
of
intellectual
property
rights
at
least
we
used
to
the
framers
thought
it
so
important
to
do
so
that
they
put
the
need
to
have
a
limited
term
in
the
constitution
itself
nevertheless
both
congress
and
the
supreme
court
seem
to
have
given
up
on
that
one
we
restrict
the
scope
of
intellectual
property
rights
so
that
they
can
not
cover
raw
facts
or
general
ideas
only
the
range
of
innovation
and
expression
in
between
at
least
we
used
to
developments
in
database
protection
gene
patents
and
business
method
patents
are
clearly
eroding
those
walls
as
with
fair
use
we
impose
limitations
on
the
rights
when
we
hand
them
out
in
the
first
place
the
exclusive
right
conferred
by
copyright
does
not
include
the
right
to
prevent
criticism
parody
classroom
copying
decompilation
of
computer
programs
and
so
on
though
as
the
next
chapter
shows
a
number
of
recent
legal
changes
mean
that
the
practical
ability
to
exercise
fair
use
rights
is
seriously
threatened
these
limitations
on
intellectual
property
do
not
fit
a
single
theory
unless
that
theory
is
avoiding
the
multiple
and
evolving
dangers
of
intellectual
property
itself
even
a
single
limitation
such
as
fair
use
clearly
responds
to
many
different
concerns
about
the
dangers
of
intellectual
property
rights
indeed
it
will
evolve
to
fit
new
circumstances
when
computer
programs
were
first
clearly
covered
by
copyright
law
software
engineers
wondered
if
this
would
cripple
the
industry
why
anyone
who
wishes
to
compete
with
a
dominant
program
needs
to
decompile
it
in
order
to
make
their
program
interoperable
or
simply
better
for
example
a
new
word
processing
program
no
matter
how
good
would
be
dead
on
arrival
unless
it
could
read
all
the
files
people
had
created
with
the
old
dominant
word
processing
software
but
to
do
this
the
engineers
at
the
upstart
company
would
have
to
take
apart
their
program
in
the
process
they
would
have
to
create
temporary
copies
of
the
old
program
even
though
the
final
product
the
hot
new
software
would
be
completely
different
from
the
old
would
this
be
a
violation
of
copyright
law
in
a
series
of
remarkable
and
cases
involving
such
issues
the
courts
said
decompilation
was
fair
use
the
law
of
fair
use
had
evolved
in
the
context
of
expressive
nonfunctional
works
such
as
books
poems
songs
now
it
was
being
applied
to
a
functional
product
whose
economics
depended
strongly
on
network
effects
many
types
of
programs
are
useful
only
if
they
are
widely
used
without
interoperability
we
could
never
take
our
existing
documents
or
spreadsheets
or
datasets
and
move
to
a
new
program
even
if
it
was
better
one
program
would
not
be
able
to
read
the
files
created
by
another
it
would
be
as
if
language
itself
had
been
copyrighted
to
have
said
that
the
incidental
copies
created
in
the
process
of
decompiling
software
were
actually
infringements
of
copyright
would
have
turned
the
law
on
its
head
because
of
a
technological
accident
you
needed
temporarily
to
copy
the
programs
in
order
to
understand
how
they
worked
and
make
yours
work
with
them
and
a
legal
accident
copyright
was
now
being
used
to
regulate
functional
articles
of
commerce
machines
made
of
binary
code
the
difference
between
copying
and
reading
or
copying
and
understanding
had
changed
because
of
the
technology
the
context
had
changed
because
the
law
was
being
stretched
to
cover
new
types
of
products
whose
economics
were
very
different
from
those
of
novels
rather
than
let
the
dominant
software
companies
use
copyright
to
stop
others
from
making
interoperable
software
the
courts
used
an
escape
hatch
fair
use
to
prevent
that
danger
and
to
uphold
the
basic
goal
of
copyright
encouraging
progress
in
science
and
the
useful
arts
this
long
story
is
told
to
make
a
simple
point
the
variegated
and
evolving
limitations
on
intellectual
property
are
as
important
as
the
rights
they
constrain
curtail
and
define
the
holes
matter
as
much
as
the
cheese
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
the
sony
case
in
that
case
remember
the
supreme
court
had
said
that
copying
tv
shows
in
order
to
was
fair
use
the
court
could
simply
have
stopped
there
it
could
have
said
since
most
of
what
consumers
do
is
legal
there
can
be
no
claim
of
contributory
or
vicarious
infringement
sony
is
not
contributing
to
infringement
since
consumers
are
not
infringing
copyright
by
copying
shows
in
the
first
place
interestingly
though
this
is
the
heart
of
the
ruling
the
court
went
further
it
quoted
some
seemingly
unrelated
patent
law
doctrine
on
contributory
infringement
a
finding
of
contributory
infringement
does
not
of
course
remove
the
article
from
the
market
altogether
it
does
however
give
the
patentee
effective
control
over
the
sale
of
that
item
indeed
a
finding
of
contributory
infringement
is
normally
the
functional
equivalent
of
holding
that
the
disputed
article
is
within
the
monopoly
granted
to
the
patentee
clearly
the
justices
were
concerned
that
by
using
copyright
law
the
movie
studios
could
actually
get
control
of
a
new
technology
the
fact
that
the
court
expressed
this
concern
through
an
analogy
to
patent
law
was
at
first
sight
fairly
surprising
courts
do
not
normally
look
at
copyrights
in
quite
the
same
way
as
they
look
at
patents
for
one
thing
patent
rights
are
stronger
though
they
are
harder
to
obtain
and
last
for
a
shorter
period
of
time
for
another
while
courts
often
express
concern
about
the
dangers
of
a
monopoly
over
a
particular
technology
it
is
strange
to
see
that
concern
in
the
context
of
copyright
law
an
unnecessary
monopoly
over
a
plow
or
a
grain
elevator
may
as
jefferson
pointed
out
slow
technological
development
but
a
monopoly
over
snow
white
or
ode
on
a
grecian
urn
we
do
not
normally
think
of
rights
over
expression
the
realm
of
copyright
threatening
to
sweep
within
their
ambit
an
entire
new
technological
invention
the
realm
of
patent
but
in
the
sony
case
the
supreme
court
quite
clearly
saw
that
in
a
world
where
technological
developments
made
copying
easier
the
idea
of
contributory
infringement
in
copyright
could
be
used
to
suppress
or
control
entire
technologies
that
seemed
in
the
logic
of
downside
vision
to
pose
a
threat
to
the
copyright
holder
indeed
in
some
sense
the
logic
behind
the
internet
threat
cheaper
copying
requires
greater
control
demands
this
result
though
the
sony
case
antedates
the
world
wide
web
by
a
considerable
time
if
it
is
cheap
copying
itself
that
poses
the
threat
then
the
content
owners
will
increasingly
move
to
gain
control
over
the
technologies
of
cheap
copying
using
copyright
as
their
stalking
horse
that
is
why
the
sony
court
went
beyond
the
simple
ruling
on
fair
use
to
explain
the
consequences
of
the
movie
companies
claim
in
a
footnote
the
place
where
judges
often
bury
their
most
trenchant
asides
the
court
was
almost
snide
it
seems
extraordinary
to
suggest
that
the
copyright
act
confers
upon
all
copyright
owners
collectively
much
less
the
two
respondents
in
this
case
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute
vtr
video
tape
recorders
simply
because
they
may
be
used
to
infringe
copyrights
that
however
is
the
logical
implication
of
their
claim
the
request
for
an
injunction
below
indicates
that
respondents
seek
in
effect
to
declare
vtr
contraband
their
suggestion
in
this
court
that
a
continuing
royalty
pursuant
to
a
judicially
created
compulsory
license
would
be
an
acceptable
remedy
merely
indicates
that
respondents
for
their
part
would
be
willing
to
license
their
claimed
monopoly
interest
in
vtr
to
sony
in
return
for
a
the
real
heart
of
the
sony
case
is
not
that
of
tv
programs
is
fair
use
it
is
an
altogether
deeper
principle
with
implications
for
all
of
the
holes
in
the
intellectual
property
cheese
the
sony
court
declared
that
because
video
recorders
were
capable
of
substantial
noninfringing
uses
the
manufacturers
of
those
devices
were
not
guilty
of
contributory
infringement
if
the
rights
of
copyright
holders
were
absolute
if
they
had
the
authority
to
prohibit
any
activity
that
appeared
to
pose
a
threat
to
their
current
business
model
then
it
is
quite
possible
that
video
recorders
would
have
been
guilty
of
contributory
infringement
it
is
because
we
have
and
need
multiple
exceptions
and
limitations
on
intellectual
property
that
the
supreme
court
was
able
to
resist
the
claim
that
copyright
itself
forbids
technologies
of
cheaper
copying
to
put
it
another
way
without
a
robust
set
of
exceptions
and
limitations
on
copyright
the
idea
that
cheaper
copying
requires
greater
control
will
inexorably
drive
us
toward
the
position
that
the
technologies
of
cheaper
reproduction
must
be
put
under
the
governance
of
copyright
holders
thus
we
have
a
corollary
to
the
jefferson
warning
call
it
the
sony
axiom
cheaper
copying
makes
the
limitations
on
copyright
more
rather
than
less
important
without
those
limitations
copyright
law
will
bloat
and
metastasize
into
a
claim
of
monopoly
or
at
least
control
over
the
very
architectures
of
our
communications
technology
and
that
is
exactly
where
the
logic
of
the
internet
threat
is
taking
us
today
from
napster
to
grokster
seventeen
years
after
the
sony
decision
another
court
had
to
deal
with
a
suit
by
outraged
copyright
holders
against
the
creators
of
a
technology
that
allowed
individuals
to
copy
material
cheaply
and
easily
the
suit
was
called
a
m
records
napster
was
a
file
sharing
system
the
files
were
not
kept
on
some
huge
central
server
instead
there
was
a
central
directory
think
of
a
telephone
directory
which
contained
a
constantly
updated
list
of
the
addresses
of
individual
computers
and
the
files
they
contained
anyone
who
had
the
software
could
query
the
central
registry
to
find
a
file
location
and
then
establish
a
direct
connection
anywhere
in
the
world
with
the
person
who
had
the
file
they
desired
this
decentralized
design
meant
the
system
was
extremely
robust
very
fast
and
of
nearly
infinite
capacity
using
this
technology
tens
of
millions
of
people
around
the
world
were
sharing
music
an
activity
which
record
companies
quite
understandably
viewed
as
simple
theft
in
fact
it
would
be
hard
to
think
of
a
situation
that
illustrated
the
internet
threat
better
the
case
ended
up
in
front
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
hears
cases
in
an
area
that
includes
california
and
thus
has
decided
a
lot
of
copyright
cases
over
the
years
there
was
an
irony
here
when
the
supreme
court
decided
the
sony
case
it
was
on
appeal
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
sony
with
its
rule
about
reproductive
technologies
with
substantial
noninfringing
uses
reversed
the
appeals
court
decision
the
supreme
court
was
in
effect
telling
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
was
wrong
that
its
ruling
would
have
required
the
extraordinary
legal
shorthand
for
stupid
conclusion
that
copyright
law
gave
copyright
holders
a
veto
on
new
technology
in
the
process
the
supreme
court
told
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
also
did
not
understand
the
law
of
fair
use
or
the
freedom
that
should
be
given
to
individuals
to
make
noncommercial
private
copies
the
identities
of
the
judges
had
changed
but
now
seventeen
years
later
the
same
circuit
court
had
another
case
on
exactly
the
same
issues
in
case
any
of
the
judges
might
have
missed
this
irony
it
took
david
boies
the
lawyer
for
napster
about
ninety
seconds
to
remind
them
in
his
oral
argument
this
court
he
said
adding
as
if
in
afterthought
in
the
decision
that
the
supreme
court
ultimately
reversed
in
sony
to
the
laypeople
in
the
audience
it
probably
just
seemed
like
another
piece
of
legal
droning
but
to
the
lawyers
in
the
room
the
message
was
quite
clear
the
last
time
you
got
a
case
about
a
major
new
technology
of
consumer
reproduction
you
really
screwed
it
up
hope
you
can
do
better
this
time
the
judges
mouths
quirked
not
entirely
in
pleasure
the
point
had
been
registered
think
for
a
moment
of
the
dilemma
in
which
the
court
had
been
placed
on
the
one
hand
you
had
tens
of
millions
of
people
sharing
music
files
and
napster
was
the
service
that
allowed
them
to
do
it
if
this
was
not
contributory
copyright
infringement
what
was
on
the
other
hand
napster
seemed
to
fit
very
nicely
under
the
rule
announced
in
the
sony
case
the
argument
went
like
this
like
the
vcr
the
napster
service
had
substantial
noninfringing
uses
it
allowed
bands
to
expose
their
music
to
the
world
through
the
new
artists
program
it
made
it
easy
to
share
music
which
was
no
longer
under
copyright
these
uses
clearly
do
not
infringe
copyright
there
were
also
the
claims
that
it
permitted
by
consumers
who
already
owned
the
music
or
sampling
of
music
by
listeners
as
they
decided
whether
or
not
to
buy
one
could
argue
that
shifting
and
sampling
were
fair
use
though
in
the
end
the
court
disagreed
but
since
we
have
two
clear
noninfringing
uses
the
technology
obviously
does
have
substantial
uses
that
do
not
violate
copyright
thus
napster
can
not
be
liable
as
a
contributory
infringer
just
as
sony
could
not
be
liable
for
the
betamax
supreme
court
precedent
covers
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
is
bound
by
that
precedent
all
the
judges
can
do
goes
the
argument
is
to
apply
the
words
of
the
rule
laid
down
in
sony
say
that
napster
wins
and
move
on
to
the
next
case
if
congress
wants
to
make
services
like
napster
illegal
it
is
going
to
have
to
pass
a
new
law
the
boundaries
of
the
sony
rule
are
clear
and
napster
fits
within
them
of
course
the
last
point
is
subject
to
argument
but
the
argument
for
napster
on
this
issue
was
a
good
one
not
overwhelming
there
were
more
noninfringing
uses
in
the
sony
case
because
the
normal
way
consumers
used
the
technology
in
question
was
found
to
be
a
fair
use
but
certainly
powerful
a
more
daring
strategy
was
to
suggest
that
all
the
copying
done
over
napster
was
fair
use
or
at
least
presumptively
fair
in
sony
the
supreme
court
had
said
that
the
law
presumes
that
noncommercial
private
copying
such
as
taping
a
show
at
home
for
future
viewing
is
a
fair
use
this
presumption
shifts
the
burden
to
the
copyright
holder
to
prove
that
the
practice
caused
harm
to
them
copying
on
napster
was
done
by
private
individuals
no
money
was
exchanged
does
this
mean
we
must
presume
it
was
fair
use
and
require
the
music
companies
and
songwriters
to
show
clear
evidence
of
market
harm
if
they
want
to
convince
us
otherwise
it
sounds
as
though
proving
market
harm
would
be
pretty
easy
how
could
millions
of
people
exchanging
hundreds
of
millions
of
songs
not
be
causing
harm
but
it
is
more
complicated
remember
the
jefferson
warning
we
are
not
talking
about
swiping
shoes
from
a
shoe
store
there
one
merely
has
to
show
the
theft
to
prove
the
loss
by
contrast
music
files
are
copied
without
being
taken
from
their
owner
the
record
companies
would
have
to
show
harm
to
their
market
the
people
downloading
who
do
not
purchase
music
because
it
is
available
for
free
those
who
download
but
would
not
have
purchased
do
not
count
and
we
have
to
balance
those
who
are
deterred
from
purchasing
against
those
who
purchase
a
whole
cd
because
they
are
exposed
to
new
music
through
napster
one
very
interesting
empirical
study
on
the
subject
indicates
that
the
result
is
a
wash
with
hardly
any
measurable
effect
on
sales
the
overall
drop
in
cd
purchases
results
from
larger
macroeconomic
this
study
however
has
been
subject
to
detailed
methodological
another
study
shows
a
weak
effect
on
sales
though
rather
woundingly
it
seems
to
suggest
that
the
result
is
economically
efficient
fewer
people
end
up
with
music
they
do
not
other
studies
by
contrast
support
the
record
company
position
suggesting
that
illicit
file
sharing
does
indeed
undercut
sales
of
both
cds
and
authorized
digital
given
the
complexities
of
the
issue
the
record
companies
did
not
want
to
engage
in
a
war
of
dueling
empirical
studies
so
if
napster
users
were
not
infringing
copyright
law
in
the
first
place
at
least
until
the
record
companies
came
up
with
convincing
evidence
of
market
harm
because
their
copying
was
noncommercial
then
napster
could
hardly
be
guilty
of
contributory
infringement
could
it
there
would
be
no
infringement
at
all
you
could
see
boies
arguments
as
simple
equations
between
the
cases
noninfringing
uses
such
as
recording
public
domain
films
and
programs
are
equivalent
to
noninfringing
uses
such
as
the
new
artists
program
or
sharing
public
domain
music
and
maybe
one
own
music
or
private
noncommercial
videotaping
is
equivalent
to
private
noncommercial
file
sharing
both
are
presumptively
fair
uses
either
way
and
napster
wins
napster
did
not
win
of
course
though
when
the
judges
handed
down
their
decision
it
was
clear
they
had
been
paying
attention
to
boies
at
least
enough
to
make
them
very
wary
of
tampering
with
sony
they
claimed
that
they
were
upholding
that
case
but
that
napster
could
be
liable
anyway
how
because
there
was
enough
evidence
here
to
show
that
the
controllers
of
napster
had
actual
knowledge
that
specific
infringing
material
is
available
using
its
system
that
it
could
block
access
to
the
system
by
suppliers
of
the
infringing
material
and
that
it
failed
to
remove
the
material
there
was
indeed
evidence
that
napster
knew
how
its
system
was
being
used
an
embarrassing
amount
of
it
including
early
memos
saying
that
users
will
want
anonymity
because
they
are
trading
in
pirated
music
then
there
were
nasty
circumstantial
details
like
the
thousands
of
infringing
songs
on
the
hard
drive
of
one
particular
napster
employee
the
compliance
officer
tasked
with
enforcing
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
the
recording
company
lawyers
waxed
wonderfully
sarcastic
about
that
but
despite
the
ludicrously
dirty
hands
of
napster
as
a
company
lawyers
could
see
that
the
appeals
court
was
making
a
lot
of
new
law
as
it
struggled
to
find
a
way
to
uphold
sony
while
still
making
napster
liable
the
court
ruling
sounded
reasonable
and
clear
something
that
would
only
strike
at
bad
actors
while
paying
heed
to
the
sony
axiom
and
the
assurance
of
safety
that
the
rule
in
sony
had
provided
to
technology
developers
for
the
previous
twenty
years
but
hard
cases
make
bad
law
in
order
to
accomplish
this
piece
of
legal
legerdemain
the
court
had
to
alter
or
reinterpret
the
law
in
ways
that
are
disturbing
the
first
thing
the
court
did
was
to
reject
the
argument
that
the
sharing
was
private
and
noncommercial
as
to
the
idea
that
it
is
not
private
fair
enough
sharing
one
music
with
four
million
people
does
not
sound
that
private
even
if
it
is
done
for
private
ends
in
private
spaces
what
about
noncommercial
embracing
some
earlier
rulings
on
the
subject
the
court
said
a
use
was
commercial
if
you
got
for
nothing
something
for
which
you
would
otherwise
have
to
pay
on
the
surface
this
sounds
both
clever
and
reasonable
a
way
to
differentiate
home
taping
from
global
file
sharing
but
the
argument
quickly
begins
to
unravel
true
the
betamax
owners
could
get
tv
shows
for
free
just
by
watching
at
the
regular
time
but
they
could
not
get
a
copy
of
the
show
for
free
at
the
moment
they
wanted
to
watch
it
that
was
why
they
taped
one
could
even
argue
that
napster
users
would
have
access
to
most
songs
over
the
radio
for
free
but
lawyers
quibbling
about
which
way
the
rule
cuts
in
this
case
is
not
the
point
instead
we
need
to
focus
on
the
change
in
the
definition
of
commercial
because
it
illustrates
a
wider
shift
remember
a
finding
that
a
use
is
noncommercial
makes
it
more
likely
that
a
court
will
find
it
to
be
legal
to
be
a
fair
use
the
old
test
focused
mainly
on
whether
the
motive
for
the
copying
was
to
make
money
a
different
stage
of
the
inquiry
concerned
whether
there
was
harm
to
the
copyright
market
the
napster
court
test
concentrates
on
whether
the
person
consuming
the
copy
got
something
for
free
instead
of
focusing
on
the
fact
that
the
person
making
the
copy
is
not
making
money
out
of
it
think
of
a
professor
making
electronic
copies
of
articles
for
his
students
to
download
it
focuses
on
the
presumptively
dirty
hands
of
those
who
are
getting
something
for
nothing
but
lots
of
copyright
law
is
about
getting
something
for
nothing
to
put
it
differently
one
central
goal
of
copyright
is
to
limit
the
monopoly
given
to
the
copyright
owner
so
that
he
or
she
can
not
force
citizens
to
pay
for
every
single
type
of
use
the
design
of
the
law
itself
is
supposed
to
facilitate
that
when
getting
something
for
free
comes
to
equal
commercial
in
the
analysis
of
fair
use
things
are
dangerously
out
of
balance
think
back
to
jefferson
analogy
if
i
light
my
candle
at
yours
am
i
getting
fire
for
free
when
otherwise
i
would
have
had
to
pay
for
matches
does
that
make
it
a
commercial
act
having
dismissed
the
claim
that
this
was
noncommercial
sharing
the
court
then
reinterpreted
the
sony
decision
to
allow
liability
when
there
was
actual
knowledge
of
specific
copyright
violations
an
ability
to
block
access
by
infringers
and
a
failure
to
do
so
neither
side
was
entirely
happy
with
this
ruling
but
the
record
companies
believed
rightly
that
it
would
allow
them
effectively
to
shut
napster
down
yet
the
napster
ruling
only
postponed
the
issue
the
next
set
of
file
sharing
services
to
be
sued
after
napster
were
even
more
decentralized
systems
the
napster
reinterpretation
of
sony
would
not
be
able
to
reach
them
the
file
sharing
service
called
grokster
is
a
relatively
typical
example
unlike
napster
grokster
had
no
central
registry
the
system
was
entirely
run
by
the
individual
peer
computers
because
the
system
was
designed
this
way
the
people
who
made
and
distributed
the
software
had
no
knowledge
of
specific
infringing
files
the
users
were
doing
the
searching
indexing
and
storing
and
grokster
had
no
ability
to
control
their
behavior
for
those
reasons
a
court
of
appeals
held
that
grokster
was
not
liable
as
in
sony
the
system
had
substantial
noninfringing
uses
lots
of
interesting
content
was
traded
on
grokster
with
the
copyright
holder
consent
other
material
was
in
the
public
domain
grokster
made
money
by
streaming
advertisements
to
the
users
of
its
software
the
movie
companies
and
record
companies
saw
this
as
a
flagrant
piracy
ring
grokster
response
was
that
like
the
makers
of
the
vcr
it
was
simply
providing
a
technology
its
financial
interest
was
in
people
using
that
technology
not
in
using
it
for
illicit
purposes
though
like
the
vcr
manufacturer
it
would
profit
either
way
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
true
the
majority
of
the
material
traded
on
grokster
was
illicitly
copied
but
the
court
felt
that
it
could
not
give
the
recording
or
movie
companies
control
over
a
technology
simply
because
it
allowed
for
easier
copying
even
if
most
of
that
copying
was
illegal
as
i
tried
to
point
out
in
the
section
on
the
sony
axiom
that
line
of
thought
leads
to
copyright
holders
having
a
veto
over
technological
development
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
supreme
court
stepped
in
in
the
case
of
mgm
the
supreme
court
followed
the
line
of
the
napster
court
but
went
even
further
the
court
created
a
new
type
of
contributory
copyright
infringement
while
apparently
denying
it
was
doing
so
grokster
and
its
fellow
services
were
liable
because
of
three
different
kinds
of
evidence
that
they
had
intended
to
induce
copyright
violation
first
they
were
trying
to
satisfy
a
known
demand
for
copyright
infringement
this
could
be
shown
by
the
way
that
they
advertised
themselves
as
alternatives
to
the
notorious
filesharing
service
napster
second
the
file
sharing
services
did
not
try
to
develop
filtering
software
to
identify
and
eliminate
copyrighted
content
though
this
alone
would
not
have
been
enough
to
make
them
liable
finally
their
system
clearly
profited
by
use
which
they
knew
was
driven
in
the
most
part
by
illicit
copying
this
too
would
not
have
been
enough
by
itself
the
court
added
but
had
to
be
seen
in
the
context
of
the
whole
record
of
the
case
let
me
be
clear
i
wept
no
tears
for
napster
grokster
and
their
ilk
i
see
no
principle
vindicated
by
class
kids
getting
access
to
music
they
do
not
want
to
pay
for
it
is
difficult
to
take
seriously
the
sanctimonious
preening
of
those
who
cast
each
junior
downloader
of
corporate
rock
as
a
ché
guevara
fighting
heroically
to
bring
about
a
new
creative
landscape
in
music
it
is
almost
as
hard
to
take
seriously
the
record
industry
executives
who
moralistically
denounce
the
downloading
in
the
name
of
the
poor
suffering
artists
when
they
preside
over
a
system
of
contracts
with
those
same
artists
that
makes
feudal
indenture
look
benign
the
file
sharing
companies
themselves
were
also
pretty
unappealing
many
of
the
services
were
bloated
with
adware
and
spyware
true
some
of
their
software
engineers
started
with
a
belief
that
this
was
a
revolutionary
technology
that
would
break
the
record
companies
and
usher
in
a
new
era
of
musical
creativity
whether
one
agrees
or
disagrees
with
them
it
is
hard
for
me
at
least
to
doubt
their
sincerity
but
even
this
quality
did
not
last
long
for
most
of
the
people
involved
the
words
stock
options
worked
their
normal
morally
debilitating
magic
in
internal
company
correspondence
attacks
on
the
hypocrisy
of
the
music
companies
and
defenses
of
a
democratic
communications
structure
imperceptibly
gave
way
to
discussions
of
customer
base
user
experience
and
saleable
demographics
i
care
little
that
napster
and
grokster
as
individual
companies
lost
their
specific
legal
battles
there
are
few
heroes
in
this
story
but
if
we
had
to
rely
on
heroes
nothing
would
ever
get
done
i
do
care
about
the
technology
behind
napster
and
grokster
about
the
kind
of
decentralized
system
it
represents
i
also
care
about
the
principle
i
identified
as
the
sony
axiom
a
principle
that
goes
far
beyond
music
systems
or
the
internet
as
a
whole
the
supreme
court
decision
in
grokster
could
have
been
much
worse
but
it
still
offers
a
modest
threat
both
to
that
technology
and
to
that
axiom
what
is
so
great
about
systems
we
talk
about
cheap
speech
on
the
internet
but
bandwidth
is
actually
expensive
if
one
is
talking
about
music
or
video
files
and
one
wishes
to
speak
to
many
people
in
a
short
period
of
time
one
vital
way
to
have
cheap
speech
is
over
networks
if
many
of
your
viewers
or
listeners
are
willing
to
become
broadcasting
stations
as
they
watch
you
can
cheaply
reach
a
million
people
in
a
short
period
of
time
with
your
video
of
abuse
in
abu
ghraib
or
your
parody
of
political
leaders
you
do
not
need
to
rely
on
a
broadcasting
station
or
even
on
the
continued
existence
of
entities
such
as
youtube
which
face
their
own
legal
worries
by
making
your
listeners
your
distributors
you
can
quickly
reach
the
same
number
of
ears
that
the
radio
waves
allow
the
record
companies
to
reach
one
need
not
cheer
grokster
much
of
what
went
on
there
was
indeed
illicit
but
there
are
two
key
things
to
understand
about
networks
the
first
is
that
they
are
hard
to
police
they
have
multiple
nodes
that
is
why
they
work
it
means
they
will
have
both
infringing
and
noninfringing
uses
and
the
noninfringing
uses
will
be
centrally
connected
to
our
deepest
values
of
free
speech
and
cultural
decentralization
the
second
feature
of
networks
is
even
more
basic
they
are
networks
and
thus
subject
to
the
laws
of
network
economics
in
short
they
only
work
well
if
many
people
use
them
a
person
who
uses
a
system
that
no
one
else
uses
is
in
the
position
of
the
person
who
owns
the
only
fax
machine
in
the
world
networks
provide
cheap
and
unregulable
audiovisual
or
speech
to
a
mass
audience
and
if
the
past
is
any
guide
those
networks
will
also
carry
large
amounts
of
illicit
material
just
as
photocopying
machines
and
vcrs
are
widely
used
to
violate
copyright
the
grokster
case
makes
it
harder
but
not
impossible
to
have
successful
widely
used
systems
that
are
not
themselves
illicit
if
they
are
widely
used
there
will
be
infringing
content
if
you
try
to
police
them
and
filter
them
you
will
know
more
about
that
infringing
content
and
thus
might
be
liable
that
was
the
point
of
the
napster
case
if
you
do
not
you
will
be
failing
to
take
precautions
that
was
the
point
of
the
grokster
case
what
is
a
poor
network
to
do
apart
from
making
sure
that
the
last
four
letters
of
your
service
name
are
not
i
am
to
advise
you
a
decision
does
not
need
to
make
an
activity
illegal
in
order
to
impede
it
it
only
needs
to
make
it
uncertain
already
for
example
the
free
and
so
far
as
i
could
tell
entirely
meaning
service
bonpoo
which
allowed
you
to
send
large
file
attachments
to
many
people
at
once
has
shut
down
all
of
its
capabilities
except
photo
transfer
that
is
simply
one
trivial
instance
of
a
larger
harm
lots
of
new
communications
technologies
will
remain
undeveloped
because
of
the
uncertainties
left
by
this
ruling
my
colleague
jennifer
jenkins
gave
one
useful
hyperbolic
illustration
drawing
on
earlier
work
by
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
if
one
were
launching
the
ipod
today
it
is
not
clear
how
it
would
fare
under
grokster
standard
of
course
there
is
no
danger
that
the
ipod
will
be
challenged
it
has
become
respectable
and
the
music
companies
ended
up
sanctioning
it
but
how
does
it
fare
if
we
simply
apply
the
tests
laid
down
in
the
grokster
case
there
is
apple
tainted
advertising
campaign
urging
users
to
rip
mix
and
burn
does
this
not
suggest
complicity
or
even
intent
there
is
the
fact
that
the
ipod
does
not
restrict
itself
solely
to
proprietary
formats
protected
by
digital
rights
management
it
also
allows
uncontrolled
files
despite
the
fact
that
this
format
is
notoriously
used
to
transfer
files
against
the
wishes
of
the
copyright
owner
this
surely
is
a
failure
to
police
and
finally
there
is
the
fact
that
it
would
cost
about
to
fill
an
ipod
with
songs
downloaded
from
itunes
clearly
apple
must
be
aware
that
much
of
the
music
that
fills
ipods
is
illicitly
copied
they
are
profiting
from
that
fact
to
drive
demand
for
the
product
just
as
grokster
was
profiting
from
the
attractions
of
illicit
traffic
to
drive
people
to
use
their
service
no
one
is
going
to
sue
apple
now
of
course
in
fact
established
players
in
the
marketplace
are
probably
fairly
safe
and
have
better
lawyers
but
what
if
a
product
as
good
as
the
ipod
were
being
developed
now
by
some
upstart
company
what
if
it
were
no
more
and
no
less
likely
to
be
used
for
infringing
purposes
would
the
business
plan
ever
see
the
light
of
day
or
would
it
be
quietly
smothered
due
to
legal
uncertainty
i
have
little
sympathy
for
grokster
the
company
but
the
decision
that
doomed
it
is
a
bad
piece
of
technology
policy
there
is
a
second
reason
to
dislike
the
grokster
decision
despite
some
of
the
announcements
made
when
the
decision
was
handed
down
the
supreme
court
has
not
killed
systems
the
concept
is
far
too
well
entrenched
but
the
decision
will
mean
that
there
are
fewer
of
them
that
are
widely
used
easy
to
operate
and
made
by
responsible
and
reputable
people
you
can
trust
this
will
probably
lessen
but
not
end
illicit
copying
online
but
that
effect
comes
with
a
price
it
makes
our
communications
architecture
a
little
bit
more
tightly
controlled
reducing
but
not
removing
the
availability
of
methods
of
mass
distribution
that
are
entirely
outside
centralized
public
or
private
control
it
is
another
relatively
small
step
toward
an
internet
that
is
more
like
cable
tv
or
itunes
a
flow
of
approved
content
one
might
decide
that
such
a
price
was
well
worth
paying
but
where
is
the
limiting
principle
or
end
point
of
the
logic
that
led
to
it
there
is
no
provision
in
statutory
copyright
law
that
imposes
liability
for
contributory
or
vicarious
infringement
none
the
patent
statute
has
such
a
provision
not
the
copyright
act
the
courts
have
simply
made
the
scheme
up
themselves
then
they
made
up
limitations
such
as
sony
in
order
to
rein
it
in
in
grokster
the
supreme
court
went
further
it
made
up
a
new
type
of
inducement
liability
fine
as
i
have
tried
to
indicate
here
the
decision
is
not
as
dreadful
as
it
is
reputed
to
be
but
so
long
as
there
is
any
unregulated
space
in
our
communications
network
some
portion
of
it
will
have
illicitly
copied
content
on
it
the
more
the
system
is
free
of
central
control
the
more
it
is
open
to
use
by
any
citizen
the
cheaper
it
gets
all
very
desirable
characteristics
the
more
illicit
content
there
will
be
that
is
the
premise
of
the
internet
threat
the
belief
that
control
must
rise
as
copying
costs
fall
i
have
tried
here
to
suggest
an
alternative
interpretation
the
sony
axiom
without
a
strong
internal
set
of
limitations
over
copyright
cheaper
copying
and
the
logic
of
the
internet
threat
will
always
drive
us
toward
giving
control
over
our
communications
architecture
to
the
content
industries
there
was
one
particularly
striking
moment
in
the
napster
oral
argument
the
lawyer
for
the
recording
companies
was
arguing
that
napster
was
illegal
the
judges
interrupted
as
they
often
do
and
there
was
a
debate
about
the
likely
reach
of
any
ruling
that
would
shut
down
napster
i
am
not
trying
to
say
the
internet
is
illegal
said
the
lawyer
there
was
a
pause
as
everyone
weighed
those
words
carefully
my
response
would
be
really
why
not
the
logic
of
the
internet
threat
leads
to
the
position
that
a
network
is
either
controlled
or
illegal
the
better
and
cheaper
the
network
the
tighter
the
control
needed
the
internet
itself
could
have
been
designed
differently
there
could
have
been
more
centralized
control
filtering
of
content
a
design
based
on
transmission
closed
protocols
that
allow
users
only
a
limited
number
of
options
indeed
there
were
such
systems
the
national
french
minitel
system
is
an
example
the
internet
represents
the
opposite
set
of
choices
freedom
from
centralized
control
absence
of
intervention
in
a
famous
article
saltzer
reed
and
clark
provided
the
argument
that
an
network
that
is
dumb
and
leaves
processing
to
the
ends
the
smart
terminals
at
either
end
of
the
wires
will
be
stable
and
but
it
will
also
be
remarkably
uncontrolled
and
it
will
lower
global
copying
costs
close
to
zero
for
digital
content
it
is
that
principle
that
has
made
it
successful
to
put
it
tersely
the
logic
of
the
internet
threat
runs
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
to
the
internet
itself
the
logic
of
control
is
not
the
logic
of
the
net
here
is
one
last
thought
experiment
apply
the
same
test
i
suggested
for
the
ipod
to
the
internet
imagine
you
knew
nothing
of
the
net
those
of
you
who
are
over
may
actually
be
able
to
remember
when
you
knew
nothing
of
the
net
imagine
that
you
are
sitting
in
a
room
somewhere
discussing
perhaps
with
a
group
of
government
bureaucrats
or
some
policy
analysts
from
the
commerce
department
whether
to
develop
this
particular
network
the
scientists
are
enthusiastic
they
talk
of
robustness
and
dumb
networks
with
smart
terminals
they
talk
of
and
html
and
decentralized
systems
that
run
on
open
protocols
so
that
anyone
can
connect
to
this
network
and
use
it
any
way
they
want
to
you
of
course
know
nothing
about
the
truly
astounding
outburst
of
creativity
and
communication
that
would
actually
flower
on
such
a
system
that
would
flower
precisely
because
it
is
so
open
and
no
one
country
or
company
controls
it
or
the
protocols
that
run
it
you
do
not
know
that
millions
of
people
worldwide
will
assemble
the
greatest
factual
reference
work
the
world
has
ever
seen
on
this
network
often
providing
their
information
for
free
out
of
some
bizarre
love
of
sharing
you
do
not
know
about
or
or
the
newspapers
of
the
world
online
or
search
engines
automatic
page
translation
or
browsers
you
can
not
imagine
free
or
software
being
assembled
by
thousands
of
programmers
worldwide
is
only
a
dimly
understood
phenomenon
to
you
teenagers
in
your
world
have
never
heard
of
instant
messaging
a
nostalgic
thought
as
the
scientists
talk
it
becomes
clear
that
they
are
describing
a
system
without
centralized
direction
or
policing
imagine
that
your
decision
is
framed
by
the
logic
of
control
i
have
described
in
this
chapter
by
the
fears
that
the
content
industry
has
had
for
at
least
the
last
thirty
years
by
the
logic
of
the
suit
they
brought
in
sony
imagine
in
other
words
that
we
make
the
decision
to
develop
the
internet
based
on
the
values
and
fears
that
our
copyright
policy
now
exhibits
and
that
the
content
industries
have
exhibited
for
thirty
years
there
is
no
way
no
way
at
all
that
a
network
like
it
would
ever
be
developed
it
would
be
strangled
at
birth
you
would
be
told
by
the
lawyers
and
policy
wonks
that
it
would
be
a
haven
for
piracy
and
illegality
and
it
would
be
of
course
though
it
would
also
be
much
much
more
you
would
be
told
that
the
system
needed
to
be
designed
to
be
safe
for
commerce
or
it
would
never
attract
investment
that
it
would
need
to
be
controlled
and
centralized
for
it
to
be
reliable
that
it
would
need
to
be
monitored
to
stop
it
being
a
hotbed
of
crime
with
the
copyright
lawyers
in
the
room
you
would
end
up
designing
something
that
looked
like
cable
tv
or
minitel
the
internet
would
never
get
off
the
ground
the
internet
is
safe
now
of
course
because
it
developed
so
fast
that
it
was
a
reality
before
people
had
time
to
be
afraid
of
it
but
it
should
give
us
pause
that
if
we
had
our
current
guiding
set
of
policy
goals
in
place
our
assumption
that
cheaper
copying
means
we
need
greater
regulation
we
would
never
have
allowed
it
to
flourish
as
jessica
litman
points
out
we
are
increasingly
making
our
decisions
about
technology
and
communications
policy
inside
copyright
law
we
are
doing
so
according
to
the
logic
of
control
that
i
have
sketched
out
in
this
chapter
but
the
logic
of
control
is
a
partial
logic
it
blinds
us
to
certain
possibilities
ones
that
have
huge
and
proven
potential
look
at
the
internet
the
law
has
not
been
entirely
however
the
sony
case
drew
a
line
in
the
sand
which
promised
to
halt
the
inevitable
drift
toward
greater
and
greater
control
over
communications
technology
by
content
owners
it
turned
out
the
heavens
did
not
fall
indeed
the
content
companies
thrived
perhaps
that
line
was
drawn
in
the
wrong
place
reasonable
people
can
disagree
about
that
but
grokster
smudges
the
line
without
drawing
a
clear
new
one
if
that
new
line
is
drawn
according
to
the
logic
of
control
what
technologies
will
we
never
see
could
they
be
technologies
that
would
transform
our
lives
as
unimaginably
as
the
internet
has
since
i
have
described
the
story
line
the
cluster
of
metaphors
and
images
and
concerns
that
pervades
our
copyright
policy
i
labeled
it
the
internet
threat
in
the
next
chapter
i
discuss
an
alternative
story
line
a
different
way
of
understanding
our
current
policies
the
subject
of
that
story
line
is
the
known
example
of
contemporary
attempts
to
control
the
digital
world
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
or
dmca
chapter
the
farmers
tale
an
allegory
imagine
that
a
bustling
group
of
colonists
has
just
moved
into
a
new
area
a
huge
unexplored
plain
again
assume
the
native
inhabitants
have
conveniently
disappeared
some
of
the
colonists
want
to
farm
just
as
they
always
did
in
the
old
country
good
fences
make
good
neighbors
is
their
motto
others
inspired
by
the
spaces
around
them
declare
that
this
new
land
needs
new
ways
they
want
to
let
their
cattle
roam
as
they
will
their
slogan
is
protect
the
open
range
in
practice
the
eventual
result
is
a
mixture
of
the
two
regimes
fields
under
cultivation
can
be
walled
off
but
there
is
a
right
of
passage
through
the
farmers
lands
for
all
who
want
it
so
long
as
no
damage
is
done
this
means
travelers
do
not
need
to
make
costly
and
inefficient
detours
around
each
farm
in
the
long
run
these
public
roads
actually
increase
the
value
of
the
private
property
through
which
they
pass
they
also
let
the
ranchers
move
their
cattle
around
from
one
area
of
pasture
to
another
the
ranchers
become
strong
proponents
of
public
open
highways
though
some
people
muse
darkly
that
they
do
very
well
out
of
that
rule
still
most
people
want
open
highways
the
system
seems
to
work
pretty
well
in
fact
two
new
technologies
are
introduced
first
the
automobile
is
developed
now
thieves
can
drive
through
the
farmers
fields
stop
quickly
to
grab
some
corn
or
a
lettuce
and
be
back
on
the
highway
before
they
can
be
caught
of
course
the
farmers
costs
have
also
fallen
dramatically
now
they
have
tractors
to
work
their
fields
and
trucks
to
take
their
products
to
distant
markets
the
farmers
do
not
dwell
on
the
benefits
of
the
new
technology
however
understandably
they
focus
more
on
the
profits
they
could
reap
if
they
could
get
all
the
advantages
of
the
technology
and
none
of
its
costs
they
demand
new
legal
protections
aimed
at
producing
that
result
what
good
for
agriculture
is
good
for
the
nation
they
say
but
now
comes
the
second
technological
shock
the
development
of
barbed
wire
the
cost
of
erecting
impassable
barriers
falls
dramatically
the
farmers
begin
to
see
the
possibility
of
enclosing
all
of
their
land
roads
and
fields
alike
this
will
help
them
protect
their
crops
from
pilfering
but
it
will
also
allow
them
to
charge
people
for
opening
the
gates
in
their
fences
even
the
gates
on
public
roads
that
is
a
nice
extra
revenue
stream
which
will
the
farmers
say
help
encourage
agriculture
after
all
more
fences
mean
more
money
for
farmers
and
more
money
for
farmers
means
they
can
invest
in
new
methods
of
farming
which
will
mean
everyone
is
better
off
right
what
is
to
be
done
assume
that
each
side
presents
its
case
to
the
legislature
there
are
three
obvious
possibilities
first
the
legislature
can
simply
tell
each
side
to
work
it
out
amongst
themselves
the
law
will
continue
to
forbid
trespass
but
we
are
neither
going
to
make
it
a
crime
to
put
up
a
barbed
wire
fence
if
it
blocks
legitimate
public
rights
of
way
nor
to
make
it
a
crime
to
cut
a
barbed
wire
fence
unless
the
fence
cutter
is
also
a
trespasser
the
farmers
can
attempt
to
enclose
land
by
putting
barbed
wire
around
it
ranchers
and
drivers
can
legally
cut
those
fences
when
they
are
blocking
public
rights
of
way
trespass
remains
trespass
nothing
more
second
the
legislature
could
heed
the
ranchers
fears
that
barbed
wire
will
permit
the
farmers
not
only
to
protect
their
own
land
but
to
rob
the
public
of
its
existing
rights
of
way
turning
open
highways
into
toll
roads
the
ranchers
of
course
are
more
concerned
with
the
rights
of
cattle
than
people
but
most
drivers
agree
with
them
as
a
result
the
state
could
forbid
the
erection
of
a
barbed
wire
fence
where
it
might
block
a
public
right
of
way
classing
it
as
a
kind
of
theft
perhaps
third
the
legislature
could
take
the
farmers
side
theorizing
that
this
new
automobile
technology
presents
a
terrible
threat
to
agriculture
because
of
rampant
crop
piracy
the
state
could
go
beyond
the
existing
law
of
trespass
and
make
it
a
crime
to
cut
barbed
wire
fences
wherever
you
find
them
even
if
the
fences
are
enclosing
public
lands
as
well
as
private
or
blocking
public
roads
to
back
up
its
command
it
could
get
into
the
technology
regulation
business
making
the
manufacture
or
possession
of
wire
cutters
illegal
the
state
picks
option
three
wire
cutting
becomes
a
crime
wire
cutters
are
classed
with
lock
picks
and
other
tools
and
the
people
who
make
wire
cutters
are
told
their
business
is
illegal
a
storm
of
protest
arises
in
the
rural
driving
community
the
wire
cutter
manufacturers
claim
that
their
products
have
lots
of
legitimate
uses
all
to
no
avail
the
farmers
press
on
they
have
two
new
demands
cars
should
be
fitted
with
mandatory
radio
beacons
and
highways
put
under
constant
state
surveillance
in
order
to
deter
crop
theft
in
addition
car
trunks
should
be
redesigned
so
they
can
hold
less
just
in
case
the
owner
plans
to
load
them
up
with
purloined
produce
civil
libertarians
unite
with
car
manufacturers
to
attack
the
plan
the
farmers
declare
that
the
car
manufacturers
are
only
interested
in
making
money
from
potential
thieves
and
that
the
civil
libertarians
are
nervous
nellies
no
one
has
anything
to
fear
except
the
criminals
what
good
for
agriculture
is
good
for
the
nation
they
announce
again
as
the
barbed
wire
gates
swing
shut
across
the
highways
of
the
region
the
legislature
heads
back
into
session
between
paranoia
and
reality
the
dmca
i
have
argued
that
confusing
intellectual
property
with
physical
property
is
dangerous
i
stand
by
that
argument
yet
analogies
to
physical
property
are
powerful
it
is
inevitable
that
we
attempt
to
explain
new
phenomena
by
comparing
them
to
material
with
which
we
are
more
familiar
while
the
content
tales
of
theft
and
piracy
are
the
most
prevalent
they
are
by
no
means
the
only
such
analogy
one
can
make
in
this
chapter
i
try
to
prove
that
point
the
farmers
tale
is
my
allegorical
attempt
to
explain
the
struggle
over
the
single
most
controversial
piece
of
intellectual
property
legislation
in
recent
years
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
or
the
dmca
did
many
things
but
for
our
purposes
its
crucial
provisions
are
those
forbidding
the
circumvention
of
copyright
protection
systems
the
technological
measures
that
copyright
holders
can
use
to
deny
access
to
their
works
or
control
our
behavior
once
we
get
access
these
measures
include
encryption
controls
on
how
many
times
a
file
can
be
copied
password
protection
and
so
on
copyright
protection
systems
are
in
other
words
the
digital
equivalent
of
barbed
wire
used
to
add
an
additional
layer
of
physical
protection
to
the
property
owner
existing
legal
protection
but
unlike
barbed
wire
they
can
also
control
what
we
do
once
we
get
access
to
the
property
the
rules
that
forbid
circumvention
of
these
systems
are
logically
if
not
elegantly
referred
to
as
the
anticircumvention
provisions
they
are
to
be
found
in
section
of
the
copyright
act
an
ungainly
and
lumpily
written
portion
of
the
law
that
was
inserted
in
as
part
of
the
complex
set
of
amendments
collectively
referred
to
as
the
dmca
i
will
explain
the
significance
of
these
rules
in
a
moment
my
hope
is
that
the
analogy
to
the
farmers
tale
will
make
them
a
little
easier
to
understand
at
least
for
those
of
you
for
whom
talk
of
digital
rights
management
anticircumvention
provisions
and
network
effects
is
not
second
nature
notice
the
differences
between
this
allegory
and
the
internet
threat
story
line
i
described
in
the
last
chapter
there
are
two
sets
of
bad
guys
in
the
farmers
tale
the
greedy
thieves
who
are
still
thieves
in
this
story
not
heroes
and
the
greedy
farmers
who
use
a
genuine
if
indefinite
threat
posed
by
a
new
technology
to
mask
a
power
grab
the
internet
threat
is
the
story
of
an
industry
devastated
by
piracy
in
desperate
need
of
help
from
the
state
to
protect
its
legitimate
property
interests
by
contrast
the
farmers
tale
is
the
story
of
a
attempt
not
only
to
protect
property
but
to
cut
off
recognized
rights
of
public
access
in
a
way
that
will
actually
make
the
whole
society
worse
off
the
legitimate
role
of
the
state
in
protecting
private
property
has
been
stretched
into
an
attempt
to
regulate
technology
so
as
to
pick
winners
in
the
marketplace
enriching
the
farmers
at
the
expense
of
consumers
and
other
businesses
in
the
long
run
this
will
not
be
good
for
business
as
a
whole
a
patchwork
of
private
toll
roads
is
an
economic
nightmare
that
is
not
the
most
worrying
part
of
the
story
the
proposals
are
moving
in
the
direction
of
regulating
still
more
technology
the
mandatory
radio
beacons
and
constantly
monitored
roads
conjure
up
a
police
state
and
all
to
protect
a
bunch
of
hysterical
vegetable
growers
whose
political
clout
far
outweighs
their
actual
economic
importance
both
the
internet
threat
and
the
farmers
tale
are
of
course
ways
to
understand
what
is
currently
going
on
in
the
intellectual
property
wars
in
the
digital
realm
the
part
of
the
farmers
is
played
by
the
content
companies
the
recording
industry
associations
the
movie
and
software
trade
groups
pointing
to
the
threat
of
digital
piracy
they
demanded
and
received
extra
legal
protection
for
their
copyrighted
content
unlike
earlier
expansions
longer
copyright
terms
more
stringent
penalties
the
shrinking
of
exceptions
and
limitations
expansions
in
copyrightable
subject
matter
this
was
not
a
protection
of
the
work
itself
it
was
a
protection
of
the
digital
fences
wrapped
around
it
and
a
regulation
of
the
technology
that
might
threaten
those
fences
what
is
the
significance
of
this
the
digital
revolution
makes
it
easier
to
copy
copyrighted
content
it
also
makes
it
easier
to
protect
that
content
and
to
do
so
in
a
more
granular
and
precisely
calibrated
way
imagine
being
able
to
sell
a
paperback
book
that
could
only
be
read
by
the
original
purchaser
or
a
song
that
could
only
be
listened
to
by
a
particular
person
in
a
particular
room
digital
rights
management
technology
makes
it
a
lot
easier
to
do
these
things
suddenly
the
copyright
owners
have
considerable
physical
control
over
their
songs
and
software
even
after
they
have
sold
them
it
is
as
if
the
recording
industry
or
the
publishers
had
a
representative
in
your
living
room
they
can
use
that
control
not
merely
to
prevent
illicit
copying
but
to
control
and
limit
usage
in
ways
that
go
far
beyond
their
exclusive
rights
under
copyright
all
of
this
happens
without
the
law
or
the
state
doing
anything
like
barbed
wire
this
is
a
technological
protection
measure
like
the
farmers
the
content
companies
were
not
content
with
their
barbed
wire
alone
they
wanted
legally
protected
barbed
wire
in
addition
to
their
existing
legal
rights
under
copyright
under
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
it
became
illegal
to
circumvent
a
technical
protection
measure
such
as
encryption
the
digital
barbed
wire
behind
which
content
companies
secrete
their
work
even
if
what
you
did
with
the
content
when
you
got
past
the
barbed
wire
was
a
fair
use
excerpting
a
fragment
of
a
film
for
a
school
presentation
for
example
or
making
a
copy
of
an
encrypted
audio
file
for
personal
use
in
another
device
in
other
words
by
using
digital
barbed
wire
the
content
companies
could
prevent
citizens
from
making
the
fair
uses
the
copyright
law
allowed
this
undermines
some
of
the
limitations
on
their
exclusive
rights
that
the
copyright
act
explicitly
carves
out
in
section
and
thus
shifts
the
balance
of
power
that
the
copyright
act
establishes
cutting
barbed
wire
became
a
civil
wrong
and
perhaps
a
crime
even
if
the
wire
blocked
a
public
road
under
most
circumstances
making
wire
cutters
was
also
now
against
the
law
the
ranchers
whose
digital
equivalents
are
communications
companies
and
hardware
manufacturers
chafed
under
these
new
rules
the
most
powerful
groups
managed
to
get
special
dispensations
internet
service
providers
for
example
got
a
qualified
immunity
from
copyright
infringement
that
occurs
over
their
networks
but
ordinary
citizens
librarians
and
civil
libertarians
also
complained
and
they
were
not
as
well
represented
in
the
legislature
it
is
true
that
the
new
rules
may
help
to
prevent
illicit
copying
but
they
also
strike
a
blow
against
the
exercise
of
fair
use
rights
rights
that
are
important
both
to
free
speech
and
competition
even
if
the
content
companies
were
absolutely
right
about
the
threats
from
digital
piracy
this
consequence
should
make
us
pause
but
critics
of
the
dmca
say
that
there
is
little
evidence
that
the
content
companies
are
right
they
quote
some
of
the
empirical
studies
i
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
particularly
the
ones
that
show
no
net
negative
effect
from
unauthorized
music
downloading
on
cd
sales
they
claim
and
they
are
on
strong
ground
here
that
even
if
there
are
some
losses
from
the
new
copying
technologies
there
are
also
benefits
like
the
farmers
the
critics
would
argue
the
content
companies
take
the
benefits
of
the
new
technology
for
granted
but
wish
the
law
to
step
in
to
ameliorate
the
harms
it
also
creates
and
like
the
farmers
they
are
not
yet
satisfied
their
new
proposals
go
even
further
scarily
further
thus
runs
the
critics
argument
the
critics
of
the
dmca
conjure
up
a
world
in
which
it
will
be
illegal
to
lend
each
other
books
or
songs
where
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
copy
even
small
fragments
of
digital
work
for
criticism
or
parody
where
encryption
research
will
be
severely
chilled
and
where
large
quantities
of
the
public
domain
will
be
enclosed
together
with
the
copyrighted
content
that
the
dmca
is
supposed
to
protect
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
unintended
consequences
studies
give
concrete
examples
they
think
the
dmca
undoes
the
balance
at
the
heart
of
copyright
law
that
it
can
be
used
to
entrench
existing
businesses
and
their
business
methods
that
it
threatens
speech
competition
privacy
and
innovation
itself
in
short
they
think
the
dmca
is
the
worst
intellectual
property
law
congress
has
ever
passed
and
view
the
adoption
of
similar
laws
around
the
world
with
a
reaction
little
short
of
horror
those
who
supported
the
dmca
disagree
of
course
and
do
so
honestly
they
see
rampant
piracy
as
a
reality
and
the
threat
to
fair
use
as
some
kind
of
academic
hypothetical
rarely
encountered
in
reality
what
more
many
of
them
do
not
think
fair
use
is
that
important
economically
or
culturally
if
markets
work
well
users
could
be
made
to
pay
for
the
rights
that
fair
use
gives
but
only
if
they
wanted
them
one
could
buy
expensive
digital
books
which
one
was
allowed
to
share
quote
or
copy
for
classroom
use
and
cheaper
ones
which
one
had
to
keep
to
oneself
remember
that
for
many
of
the
people
who
supported
the
dmca
fair
use
is
something
of
a
loophole
certainly
not
an
affirmative
right
of
the
public
or
a
reserved
limitation
on
the
original
property
grant
from
the
state
remember
the
sony
axiom
from
chapter
they
find
the
analogy
of
fair
use
to
a
public
road
ludicrous
this
film
or
book
or
song
is
mine
anything
you
do
with
it
or
to
it
you
do
at
my
sufferance
remember
the
jefferson
warning
from
chapter
how
has
the
dmca
worked
in
reality
which
group
attitudes
were
vindicated
two
case
studies
may
help
us
to
answer
these
questions
infectious
speech
the
dmca
and
freedom
of
expression
jon
johansen
a
norwegian
was
the
unwitting
catalyst
for
one
of
the
most
important
cases
interpreting
the
dmca
he
and
two
anonymous
helpers
wrote
a
program
called
decss
depending
on
whom
you
listen
to
decss
is
described
either
as
a
way
of
allowing
people
who
use
linux
or
other
open
source
operating
systems
to
play
dvds
on
their
computers
or
as
a
tool
for
piracy
that
threatened
the
entire
movie
industry
and
violated
the
dmca
a
little
background
is
in
order
when
you
play
a
commercial
dvd
your
actions
are
partly
controlled
by
a
simple
encryption
scheme
called
css
or
the
content
scramble
system
the
dvd
copy
control
association
licenses
the
keys
to
this
encryption
system
to
the
manufacturers
of
dvd
players
without
a
key
most
dvds
could
not
be
played
the
manufacturer
then
embeds
this
key
in
its
hardware
design
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
easy
for
your
player
to
decode
and
play
the
movie
but
hard
at
least
for
a
person
of
average
technical
competence
to
copy
the
decoded
stream
because
the
dvd
copy
control
association
will
only
license
keys
to
manufacturers
whose
dvd
players
conform
exactly
to
their
specifications
the
css
scheme
can
also
be
used
to
control
viewers
in
other
ways
for
example
dvd
players
are
required
to
have
one
of
six
region
codes
depending
on
where
in
the
world
they
are
sold
region
is
the
united
states
and
canada
region
is
japan
europe
south
africa
the
middle
east
and
bizarrely
greenland
region
is
south
korea
taiwan
and
hong
kong
and
so
on
the
css
scheme
can
be
used
to
restrict
a
movie
to
a
player
with
the
appropriate
region
code
if
you
try
to
play
a
movie
coded
for
region
china
in
a
dvd
player
from
region
it
will
not
play
this
allows
filmmakers
to
distribute
different
versions
of
films
to
different
regions
at
different
times
based
on
sequential
release
in
cinemas
or
simply
to
distribute
dvds
with
different
prices
to
different
regions
without
worrying
about
whether
the
cheaper
dvds
will
leak
into
the
more
lucrative
markets
css
and
the
hardware
scheme
that
unlocks
it
can
also
be
used
to
prevent
you
from
through
the
commercials
at
the
beginning
of
the
movie
if
the
copyright
owner
does
not
want
you
to
or
from
skipping
the
fbi
notice
the
machine
will
not
do
it
in
fact
it
is
deliberately
built
so
that
it
can
not
do
it
what
we
have
here
is
a
digital
fence
that
is
partly
used
to
prevent
copying
movie
studios
are
understandably
worried
about
the
worldwide
circulation
of
perfect
digital
copies
of
their
movies
css
was
supposed
to
help
to
prevent
that
or
at
least
make
it
much
harder
but
because
almost
all
movies
are
encrypted
with
css
and
access
to
the
keys
comes
with
conditions
css
also
allows
a
more
control
over
consumers
manufacturers
are
not
allowed
to
make
players
which
can
view
movies
from
all
region
codes
or
skip
portions
of
the
dvd
that
the
owners
do
not
want
you
to
skip
the
licensing
body
puts
it
this
way
on
its
web
site
q
under
the
terms
of
the
css
licensing
agreement
is
it
legal
for
a
licensed
manufacturer
to
produce
and
sell
a
product
which
allows
a
user
to
disable
any
css
protections
a
no
such
products
are
not
allowed
under
the
terms
of
the
css
license
they
are
illegal
a
technology
introduced
to
protect
intellectual
property
rights
allows
control
in
ways
that
those
rights
alone
do
not
before
the
dmca
the
movie
companies
could
have
done
exactly
this
they
could
have
wrapped
their
movies
in
a
digital
fence
the
consumer
electronics
companies
that
wanted
to
could
license
a
key
and
be
allowed
to
use
a
trademark
that
indicated
that
they
were
approved
by
the
dvd
copy
control
association
but
what
if
a
manufacturer
of
dvd
players
felt
that
american
consumers
wanted
to
be
able
to
play
their
japanese
anime
movies
without
buying
another
dvd
player
to
do
so
or
what
if
they
thought
people
were
antsy
and
did
not
want
to
watch
the
fbi
notice
before
every
film
the
manufacturer
could
have
tried
to
reverse
engineer
the
css
system
to
figure
out
how
it
worked
if
they
succeeded
they
could
make
a
player
that
was
free
of
the
restrictions
that
the
css
licensing
authority
imposed
of
course
there
were
some
legal
limitations
even
before
the
dmca
our
hypothetical
manufacturer
could
not
break
into
the
safe
where
the
css
code
was
being
held
or
bribe
an
employee
to
provide
it
that
would
be
a
trespass
or
a
violation
of
trade
secret
law
it
could
not
violate
copyright
laws
over
the
various
types
of
software
that
controlled
dvd
players
it
could
not
use
the
trademarks
of
any
of
the
entities
involved
including
any
seal
of
approval
granted
by
the
dvd
copy
control
association
but
it
could
at
least
in
the
united
states
try
to
reverse
engineer
the
product
so
as
to
make
a
competing
product
with
features
that
the
customers
liked
more
it
would
be
no
more
illegal
than
a
company
making
a
cheaper
generic
razor
cartridge
that
fits
my
expensive
gillette
mach
razor
a
generic
printer
cartridge
to
replace
the
expensive
one
in
my
lexmark
printer
or
for
that
matter
a
generic
remote
control
for
my
garage
door
opener
in
each
case
of
course
the
original
manufacturer
would
prefer
that
i
use
their
products
rather
than
the
unlicensed
ones
they
can
design
their
product
to
make
it
hard
to
use
a
generic
replacement
or
even
tell
me
that
my
warranty
will
be
void
if
i
use
one
but
they
can
not
say
that
the
unlicensed
product
is
illegal
we
are
back
in
option
one
of
the
tale
before
the
legislature
acted
the
farmers
can
put
up
their
wire
and
even
use
it
to
block
passage
that
would
be
otherwise
legal
but
it
is
not
a
crime
to
figure
out
a
way
through
the
fence
unless
the
fence
cutter
is
also
a
trespasser
the
dmca
however
might
have
changed
all
of
that
let
us
return
to
johansen
the
norwegian
he
and
his
two
anonymous
collaborators
claimed
that
they
were
affected
by
another
limitation
imposed
by
the
css
licensing
body
at
that
time
there
was
no
way
to
play
dvds
on
a
computer
running
linux
or
any
other
free
or
open
source
operating
system
i
will
talk
more
about
free
and
open
source
software
later
let
say
you
buy
a
laptop
a
sony
vaio
running
windows
for
example
it
has
a
slot
in
the
side
for
dvds
to
slide
in
and
software
that
comes
along
with
it
which
allows
the
dvd
reader
to
decode
and
play
the
disk
the
people
who
wrote
the
software
have
been
licensed
by
the
dvd
copy
control
association
and
provided
with
a
css
key
but
at
the
time
johansen
set
out
to
create
decss
the
licensing
body
had
not
licensed
keys
to
any
free
or
open
source
software
developers
say
johansen
buys
the
sony
vaio
but
with
the
linux
operating
system
on
it
instead
of
windows
the
computer
is
the
same
the
little
slot
is
still
there
writing
an
open
source
program
to
control
the
dvd
player
is
trivial
but
without
the
css
key
there
is
no
way
for
the
player
to
decode
and
play
the
movie
the
licensing
authority
later
did
license
an
open
source
player
perhaps
because
they
realized
its
unavailability
gave
johansen
a
strong
defense
perhaps
because
they
feared
an
antitrust
suit
or
perhaps
because
they
just
got
around
to
it
johansen
and
his
supporters
claimed
strenuously
that
decss
was
not
in
fact
an
aid
to
illicit
copying
in
fact
they
argued
that
css
was
not
really
designed
to
protect
dvds
against
illicit
copying
commercial
dvd
pirates
do
not
need
to
crack
the
css
encryption
quite
the
contrary
they
produce
exact
copies
of
the
dvd
css
encryption
and
all
and
the
buyer
player
dutifully
decodes
it
and
plays
it
johansen
claimed
that
his
goals
were
very
different
from
those
of
the
pirates
the
motivation
was
being
able
to
play
dvds
the
way
we
want
to
i
do
like
being
forced
to
use
a
specific
operating
system
or
a
specific
player
to
watch
movies
or
listen
to
music
nor
do
i
like
being
forced
to
watch
commercials
when
your
dvd
player
tells
you
this
operation
is
not
allowed
when
you
try
to
skip
commercials
it
becomes
pretty
clear
that
drm
really
stands
for
digital
restrictions
in
johansen
view
css
was
simply
an
attempt
to
control
consumers
an
attempt
which
should
be
a
valid
target
for
legal
reverse
engineering
he
has
a
point
there
were
indeed
other
ways
to
copy
dvds
which
did
not
require
decss
and
which
gave
you
files
of
more
manageable
size
css
was
indeed
more
than
a
simple
anticopying
device
the
entire
scheme
the
keys
the
licenses
the
hardware
requirements
was
designed
to
give
movie
studios
greater
control
over
their
movies
in
a
number
of
ways
some
of
them
unrelated
to
copying
on
the
other
hand
he
overstated
the
point
one
function
of
css
was
indeed
to
make
it
harder
for
the
average
person
playing
a
dvd
on
a
computer
to
copy
the
file
from
the
dvd
to
her
hard
disk
and
give
it
to
a
friend
it
is
very
easy
for
the
average
to
take
a
commercial
music
cd
change
the
songs
into
smaller
files
in
the
format
and
share
them
with
a
friend
it
is
not
as
easy
to
do
the
same
thing
to
a
dvd
not
impossible
just
harder
and
css
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
johansen
program
decss
was
quickly
made
available
worldwide
mirror
sites
provided
copies
of
the
program
and
lists
of
such
locations
were
easy
to
find
using
standard
search
tools
one
such
list
was
provided
by
the
online
site
run
by
a
magazine
called
the
hacker
quarterly
the
magazine
features
everything
from
pictures
of
pay
phones
from
around
the
world
to
tips
on
how
to
hack
into
computer
or
telephone
systems
its
publisher
is
one
eric
corley
who
goes
by
the
name
emmanuel
goldstein
the
resistance
leader
in
george
orwell
in
universal
city
studios
brought
suit
against
a
number
of
individuals
for
distributing
decss
the
case
was
called
universal
city
studios
reimerdes
et
al
corley
was
among
the
defendants
the
suit
prominently
included
a
claim
that
the
defendants
were
violating
the
dmca
it
was
in
this
case
that
the
dmca
received
its
first
major
legal
challenge
depending
on
the
characterization
of
the
facts
the
case
seems
to
be
about
very
different
things
it
could
seem
a
classic
first
amendment
fight
plucky
magazine
publisher
told
copyright
law
forbids
him
from
linking
to
other
sites
on
the
internet
or
it
could
seem
the
very
essence
of
illegal
activity
shadowy
site
which
unashamedly
caters
to
computer
tries
to
spread
access
to
the
burglar
tools
of
cyberspace
of
course
most
lawsuits
involve
conflicts
over
facts
much
of
what
lawyers
do
is
put
the
same
facts
into
different
conceptual
boxes
but
here
merely
describing
what
corley
does
what
hackers
are
or
what
magazine
is
all
about
involves
one
in
a
profound
culture
clash
the
best
way
to
capture
the
clash
may
be
to
quote
from
an
early
entry
about
corley
in
wikipedia
the
remarkable
online
encyclopedia
the
encyclopedia
first
quotes
the
description
of
magazine
from
judge
lewis
kaplan
the
federal
district
court
judge
who
decided
the
reimerdes
case
the
hacker
quarterly
has
included
articles
on
such
topics
as
how
to
steal
an
internet
domain
name
how
to
write
more
secure
asp
code
access
other
people
secure
your
linux
box
intercept
cellular
phone
calls
how
to
put
linux
on
an
xbox
how
to
remove
spyware
and
break
into
the
computer
systems
at
costco
stores
and
federal
express
one
issue
contains
a
guide
to
the
federal
criminal
justice
system
for
readers
charged
with
computer
hacking
in
addition
operates
a
web
site
located
at
http
which
is
managed
primarily
by
corley
and
has
been
in
existence
since
the
wikipedia
article
then
continues
as
follows
while
the
judge
tone
is
clearly
disapproving
others
would
point
out
that
bookstores
movies
and
television
channels
are
filled
with
material
on
how
to
commit
murder
and
that
without
the
efforts
of
the
hacker
community
however
illintentioned
computer
insecurity
would
be
even
more
of
a
problem
than
it
already
in
fact
judge
kaplan
was
not
entirely
disapproving
he
mentions
articles
in
that
cover
laudable
or
innocuous
tasks
as
well
as
others
about
tasks
that
most
readers
would
find
objectionable
and
rightly
think
to
be
illegal
but
the
anonymous
volunteer
who
wrote
this
version
of
corley
wikipedia
entry
clearly
saw
the
issue
differently
wikipedia
does
not
portray
the
hacker
community
as
universally
benevolent
however
but
that
community
is
also
seen
as
providing
a
useful
service
rather
than
merely
a
set
of
guides
for
digital
burglars
to
most
people
pointing
out
vulnerabilities
in
computer
security
systems
seemed
at
least
in
like
telling
the
world
that
your
neighbor
has
forgotten
to
lock
his
door
and
all
his
possessions
are
there
for
the
taking
but
to
the
online
community
it
is
by
no
means
so
clear
from
the
perspective
of
those
who
are
knowledgeable
in
the
field
there
is
a
moral
continuum
there
is
clearly
legitimate
computer
security
and
cryptography
research
which
includes
attempts
to
break
into
computer
systems
to
test
their
defenses
that
is
how
one
finds
out
they
are
secure
after
all
then
there
are
hackers
this
term
could
be
used
to
describe
those
who
merely
like
to
program
richard
stallman
for
example
the
originator
of
the
free
software
movement
describes
himself
thus
but
the
term
could
also
be
used
for
those
who
are
interested
in
security
or
interoperability
making
two
systems
work
together
that
was
johansen
declared
goal
after
all
but
some
hackers
go
further
they
believe
that
exploring
and
disclosing
the
weaknesses
of
supposedly
secure
systems
is
intellectually
fulfilling
practically
important
and
protected
by
the
first
amendment
they
disclaim
both
moral
and
legal
responsibility
for
the
consequences
of
their
disclosures
or
at
least
the
negative
consequences
they
frequently
take
credit
for
the
positive
consequences
such
as
improved
security
finally
there
are
crackers
whose
interest
in
gaining
entry
to
computer
systems
is
malicious
or
for
financial
gain
at
what
point
on
this
continuum
does
the
activity
become
legally
or
morally
unacceptable
as
the
reimerdes
trial
went
on
it
became
clear
that
the
answer
the
dmca
gave
might
not
be
the
same
as
the
one
given
even
by
undeniably
legitimate
computer
scientists
a
large
number
of
legal
arguments
were
involved
in
the
reimerdes
case
but
for
our
purposes
here
the
most
important
ones
dealt
with
the
relationship
between
copyright
and
the
first
amendment
what
is
that
relationship
in
one
obvious
sense
copyright
actually
aids
free
speech
by
providing
an
incentive
to
create
works
copyright
add
s
the
fuel
of
interest
to
the
fire
of
genius
and
thus
helps
to
create
the
system
of
decentralized
creative
production
and
distribution
i
described
in
chapter
but
copyright
also
restrains
speech
at
its
base
it
allows
an
individual
to
call
upon
the
state
to
prevent
someone
from
speaking
or
expressing
themselves
in
a
particular
way
this
may
involve
a
simple
refusal
to
let
the
speaker
use
some
text
picture
verse
or
story
in
their
message
or
it
may
involve
a
refusal
to
let
them
transform
it
in
some
way
neither
copyright
law
nor
the
american
constitution
is
blind
to
these
dangers
copyright
has
a
number
of
safeguards
the
most
important
of
these
is
that
copyright
only
covers
original
expression
both
the
ideas
and
facts
in
this
book
can
be
used
by
anyone
without
my
permission
thus
goes
the
theory
the
speaker
freedom
of
expression
is
never
truly
restrained
the
only
thing
i
am
barred
from
is
using
your
words
your
exact
plot
your
photograph
your
music
not
your
facts
your
ideas
your
genre
the
events
you
describe
that
is
not
always
enough
of
course
sometimes
the
problem
is
that
the
speaker
can
not
paraphrase
around
the
restraints
posed
by
copyright
he
needs
to
use
the
particular
text
or
image
in
question
to
convey
his
message
the
ideas
the
facts
or
a
mere
paraphrase
of
the
expression
would
not
be
enough
in
cases
like
that
copyright
answer
is
fair
use
a
politician
could
not
prevent
journalists
who
disagree
with
him
from
quoting
his
autobiography
in
discussing
his
life
if
an
author
wishes
to
tell
the
story
of
gone
with
the
wind
from
the
slaves
perspective
she
may
do
so
in
the
face
of
the
copyright
holders
attempts
to
stop
her
even
fair
use
though
may
not
cover
every
concern
about
free
expression
before
world
war
ii
alan
cranston
later
a
senator
wanted
to
convince
american
readers
that
the
version
of
hitler
mein
kampf
published
in
the
united
states
was
distorted
he
believed
it
to
be
slanted
toward
american
sensibilities
downplaying
both
and
german
expansionism
his
solution
to
publish
his
own
english
translation
taken
direct
and
uncut
from
the
german
edition
he
wanted
to
prove
with
hitler
own
words
that
the
united
states
had
a
dangerously
distorted
version
of
the
german
leader
but
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
copyright
law
forbids
and
it
is
not
clear
that
fair
use
allows
in
the
end
he
did
it
anyway
for
the
moment
though
it
is
enough
to
realize
that
copyright
law
is
not
immune
from
the
first
amendment
or
from
free
speech
concerns
more
generally
if
we
do
not
notice
that
most
of
the
time
it
is
because
the
internal
limitations
of
copyright
fair
use
the
distinction
and
so
on
generally
take
care
of
the
first
amendment
issue
not
because
the
issue
was
never
there
so
what
first
amendment
issues
did
the
dmca
present
most
obviously
the
dmca
gave
a
new
right
to
copyright
owners
by
using
a
few
simple
technological
measures
they
could
distribute
a
work
in
a
particular
format
and
yet
because
of
their
new
intellectual
property
right
they
could
make
illegal
an
otherwise
lawful
process
of
gaining
access
for
the
purposes
of
making
fair
use
of
course
the
first
amendment
allows
me
to
make
fair
use
factually
impossible
i
can
do
that
without
raising
any
constitutional
issues
by
hiding
my
manuscript
and
never
letting
you
see
it
or
just
by
using
unbreakable
encryption
on
my
digital
products
it
allows
me
to
use
existing
conventional
property
rights
to
make
fair
use
illegal
if
i
own
the
only
copy
of
the
book
and
it
is
inside
my
house
it
would
be
trespass
for
you
to
enter
no
first
amendment
problem
there
but
in
passing
the
dmca
congress
had
created
a
new
intellectual
property
right
inside
copyright
law
itself
a
law
aimed
directly
at
expression
that
made
it
illegal
to
get
access
for
the
purpose
of
making
fair
use
even
when
you
legally
bought
the
physical
book
or
the
physical
dvd
and
now
wish
to
quote
it
or
parody
it
even
that
is
not
the
problem
it
is
that
congress
can
not
grant
the
exclusive
rights
of
copyright
without
simultaneously
accompanying
them
by
the
limitations
of
fair
regardless
of
what
physical
constraints
and
tangible
property
rights
might
do
to
limit
my
ability
to
make
fair
uses
congress
had
now
by
law
allowed
a
copyright
owner
to
distribute
a
particular
work
with
the
exclusive
rights
but
without
some
of
those
limitations
imagine
that
congress
had
passed
the
following
law
instead
of
the
dmca
any
copyright
owner
can
make
it
illegal
to
make
a
fair
use
of
a
copyrighted
work
by
putting
a
red
dot
on
their
books
records
and
films
before
selling
them
it
shall
be
a
crime
to
circumvent
the
red
dot
even
if
but
for
the
dot
the
use
would
have
been
fair
that
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional
it
gives
copyright
owners
a
new
intellectual
property
right
to
turn
off
fair
use
in
copyrighted
works
distributed
to
the
mass
market
is
the
dmca
not
the
same
thing
this
was
the
issue
in
reimerdes
true
if
i
cut
through
the
digital
fence
on
a
dvd
in
order
to
excerpt
a
small
portion
in
a
critical
documentary
i
would
not
be
violating
your
copyright
but
i
would
be
violating
the
anticircumvention
provisions
and
decss
seemed
to
be
a
tool
for
doing
what
the
dmca
forbids
by
providing
links
to
it
corley
and
were
trafficking
in
a
technology
that
allows
others
to
circumvent
a
technological
protection
measure
decss
could
of
course
be
used
for
purposes
that
did
not
violate
copyright
to
make
the
dvd
play
on
a
computer
running
linux
for
example
it
enabled
various
noninfringing
fair
uses
it
could
also
be
used
to
aid
illicit
copying
but
the
alleged
violation
of
the
dmca
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
the
alleged
violation
of
the
dmca
was
making
the
digital
wire
cutters
available
in
the
first
place
so
one
first
amendment
problem
with
the
dmca
can
be
stated
quite
simply
it
appeared
to
make
it
illegal
to
exercise
at
least
some
of
the
limitations
and
exceptions
copyright
law
needs
in
order
to
pass
first
amendment
scrutiny
or
did
it
just
make
it
very
very
difficult
to
exercise
those
rights
legally
i
could
after
all
make
a
videotape
of
the
dvd
playing
on
my
television
and
use
that
grainy
blurry
image
in
my
documentary
criticizing
the
filmmaker
the
dmca
would
not
be
violated
though
my
movie
might
be
painful
to
watch
the
other
possible
first
amendment
problem
with
the
dmca
was
that
in
regulating
programs
such
as
decss
the
dmca
was
actually
regulating
speech
the
first
challenge
to
the
dmca
was
that
by
making
tools
like
decss
illegal
the
dmca
took
away
a
constitutionally
necessary
escape
hatch
to
copyright
thus
making
copyright
law
as
a
whole
violate
the
first
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech
the
second
challenge
was
different
the
problem
was
that
the
program
itself
was
speech
and
the
dmca
was
regulating
it
illicitly
the
reasoning
went
like
this
a
computer
program
is
a
form
of
expression
and
communication
the
source
code
can
even
be
read
by
human
beings
true
it
is
an
abstract
form
of
communication
like
musical
notation
and
mathematical
algorithms
but
those
are
clearly
protected
by
the
first
amendment
congress
could
not
make
schoenberg
scale
illegal
or
punish
mathematicians
for
physics
equations
that
seemed
to
support
a
theory
of
the
universe
origin
other
than
the
creationism
that
is
currently
so
popular
true
the
source
code
is
a
description
of
a
method
of
doing
something
and
the
code
can
if
run
on
a
computer
produce
a
result
but
one
could
argue
that
those
attributes
do
not
affect
the
first
amendment
protection
neither
a
recipe
for
hash
brownies
nor
a
player
piano
roll
for
the
nazi
horst
wessel
song
could
constitutionally
be
prohibited
even
though
actually
to
make
the
hash
brownies
would
be
illegal
and
even
though
the
piano
roll
is
functional
it
makes
the
player
piano
play
the
tune
true
most
people
can
not
read
computer
code
but
speech
does
not
need
to
be
common
or
accessible
to
be
protected
in
fact
the
courts
have
even
held
that
the
choice
to
communicate
in
a
particular
language
is
constitutionally
protected
in
some
settings
on
the
other
hand
software
code
is
undeniably
functional
lots
of
functional
articles
can
be
said
to
have
some
expressive
content
a
gun
an
airbag
a
crash
helmet
a
set
of
tools
a
computer
virus
and
many
actions
have
expressive
content
a
terrorist
bombing
for
example
surely
these
could
be
regulated
by
congress
to
the
defendants
decss
looked
like
a
physics
equation
a
musical
score
or
a
recipe
to
the
movie
studios
decss
had
all
the
first
amendment
significance
of
a
crowbar
lock
pick
or
for
that
matter
a
car
bombing
the
same
argument
was
repeated
over
the
hyperlinks
that
corley
and
others
provided
to
sites
which
carried
the
decss
program
speech
or
function
to
the
defendants
forbidding
to
link
to
these
sites
was
like
preventing
the
washington
post
from
describing
the
availability
of
drugs
on
certain
blocks
of
street
to
the
movie
companies
the
hyperlinks
were
the
equivalent
of
loading
potential
buyers
into
a
van
taking
them
down
there
and
giving
them
enough
money
to
make
the
purchase
which
of
the
two
first
amendment
arguments
is
more
convincing
that
the
dmca
is
a
congressionally
created
for
fair
use
or
that
software
code
is
speech
and
the
dmca
restricts
it
like
a
lot
of
scholars
before
reimerdes
went
to
trial
i
thought
that
the
first
argument
was
by
far
the
more
powerful
i
still
do
i
thought
the
odds
of
the
court
buying
the
code
is
speech
argument
were
low
about
that
i
was
wrong
though
it
turned
out
not
to
matter
a
number
of
the
reports
noted
that
after
some
initial
skepticism
judge
kaplan
had
been
impressed
by
the
expert
witnesses
particularly
those
who
had
testified
that
code
was
speech
when
the
ruling
came
out
this
impression
was
confirmed
judge
kaplan
agreed
that
code
was
a
form
of
speech
or
expression
but
celebration
was
premature
having
done
so
he
disagreed
with
the
defendants
claim
that
it
could
not
be
regulated
computer
code
is
expressive
to
that
extent
it
is
a
matter
of
first
amendment
concern
but
computer
code
is
not
purely
expressive
any
more
than
the
assassination
of
a
political
figure
is
purely
a
political
statement
code
causes
computers
to
perform
desired
functions
its
expressive
element
no
more
immunizes
its
functional
aspects
from
regulation
than
the
expressive
motives
of
an
assassin
immunize
the
action
in
an
era
in
which
the
transmission
of
computer
viruses
which
like
decss
are
simply
computer
code
and
thus
to
some
degree
expressive
can
disable
systems
upon
which
the
nation
depends
and
in
which
other
computer
code
also
is
capable
of
inflicting
other
harm
society
must
be
able
to
regulate
the
use
and
dissemination
of
code
in
appropriate
circumstances
the
constitution
after
all
is
a
framework
for
building
a
just
and
democratic
society
it
is
not
a
suicide
judge
kaplan
is
right
in
saying
that
there
can
not
be
a
line
rule
immunizing
computer
code
from
regulation
merely
because
it
has
expressive
elements
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
computer
viruses
but
the
defendants
were
not
arguing
that
computer
code
was
constitutionally
inviolable
only
that
any
law
that
regulated
it
had
to
be
subject
to
first
amendment
scrutiny
after
all
the
government
makes
the
description
of
how
to
make
a
nuclear
weapon
classified
information
that
is
clearly
speech
but
its
regulation
is
also
constitutional
the
first
amendment
is
not
and
never
was
an
absolute
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech
instead
the
question
is
whether
the
law
is
within
the
realm
of
the
freedom
of
speech
guarantee
which
in
turn
depends
on
what
kind
of
a
law
it
is
where
does
it
fit
in
the
levels
of
scrutiny
that
courts
have
constructed
to
discriminate
between
types
of
legislation
affecting
speech
is
the
dmca
a
regulation
such
as
a
law
forbidding
labor
picketing
but
allowing
other
kinds
of
demonstrations
regulations
are
given
the
highest
and
most
demanding
level
of
scrutiny
alternatively
is
it
a
neutral
regulation
such
as
a
law
that
forbids
talking
about
any
subject
in
a
library
to
judge
kaplan
the
answer
was
clear
and
grounds
for
sarcasm
the
reason
that
congress
enacted
the
provision
of
the
dmca
had
nothing
to
do
with
suppressing
particular
ideas
of
computer
programmers
and
everything
to
do
with
functionality
with
preventing
people
from
circumventing
technological
access
control
measures
just
as
laws
prohibiting
the
possession
of
burglar
tools
have
nothing
to
do
with
preventing
people
from
expressing
themselves
by
accumulating
what
to
them
may
be
attractive
assortments
of
implements
and
everything
to
do
with
preventing
burglaries
i
agree
though
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
burglar
tool
analogy
is
a
disputed
one
johansen
claimed
decss
was
more
like
a
screwdriver
something
with
both
licit
and
illicit
uses
so
the
dmca
was
regulation
that
means
it
still
has
to
pass
a
fairly
daunting
legal
threshold
it
will
only
be
upheld
if
it
furthers
an
important
or
substantial
governmental
interest
if
the
governmental
interest
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
free
expression
and
if
the
incidental
restriction
on
alleged
first
amendment
freedoms
is
no
greater
than
is
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
that
interest
judge
kaplan
felt
that
the
dmca
satisfied
that
standard
i
am
not
so
sure
yes
the
governmental
interest
in
protecting
copyright
holders
rights
is
important
and
yes
i
must
disagree
with
some
of
my
friends
in
the
civil
liberties
world
and
say
that
the
government
interest
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
free
expression
but
is
the
incidental
restriction
of
first
amendment
freedoms
no
greater
than
is
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
that
interest
in
other
words
could
the
dmca
have
achieved
its
goals
without
imposing
as
great
a
limitation
on
the
expression
of
people
like
johansen
and
corley
congress
could
have
passed
many
laws
less
restrictive
than
the
dmca
it
could
have
only
penalized
the
use
of
programs
such
as
decss
for
an
illicit
purpose
if
it
wished
to
reach
those
who
create
the
tools
as
well
as
use
them
it
could
have
required
proof
that
the
creator
intended
them
to
be
used
for
illegal
purposes
just
as
we
look
at
the
government
intention
in
creating
the
law
we
could
make
the
intent
of
the
software
writer
critical
for
the
purposes
of
assessing
whether
or
not
his
actions
are
illegal
if
i
write
a
novel
detailing
a
clever
way
to
kill
someone
and
you
use
it
to
carry
out
a
real
murder
the
first
amendment
does
not
allow
the
state
to
punish
me
if
i
write
a
manual
on
how
to
be
a
hit
man
and
sell
it
to
you
it
may
first
amendment
law
is
generally
skeptical
of
statutes
that
impose
strict
liability
without
a
requirement
of
intent
but
judge
kaplan
believed
that
the
dmca
made
the
motives
of
johansen
irrelevant
except
insofar
as
they
were
relevant
to
the
narrowly
tailored
exceptions
of
the
dmca
such
as
encryption
research
in
other
words
even
if
johansen
made
decss
so
that
he
and
his
friends
could
watch
dvds
they
purchased
legally
on
computers
running
linux
they
could
still
be
liable
for
breaking
the
dmca
the
dmca
breadth
goes
further
than
its
treatment
of
intent
the
statute
could
have
only
made
it
illegal
to
provide
a
program
yourself
but
judge
kaplan
interpreted
it
to
prohibit
even
linking
to
a
site
where
the
program
is
to
be
found
no
requirement
of
intent
no
requirement
that
you
actually
supply
the
infringing
program
that
is
a
pretty
broad
interpretation
and
one
which
he
admits
restricts
expression
how
could
he
conclude
that
restrictions
this
broad
were
no
greater
than
essential
from
his
rhetoric
the
answer
is
clear
judge
kaplan
believes
the
story
of
the
internet
threat
i
discussed
in
chapter
he
sees
decss
as
a
poison
in
fact
he
thinks
it
is
worse
than
a
poison
because
it
may
spread
to
infect
others
it
is
a
disease
a
virus
the
dmca
is
the
stern
and
harsh
quarantine
required
to
control
it
a
digital
public
health
measure
his
reasoning
is
worth
quoting
at
length
there
was
a
time
when
copyright
infringement
could
be
dealt
with
quite
adequately
by
focusing
on
the
infringing
act
the
copyright
holder
usually
was
able
to
trace
the
copies
up
the
chain
of
distribution
find
and
prosecute
the
infringer
and
shut
off
the
infringement
at
the
source
in
principle
the
digital
world
is
very
different
once
a
decryption
program
like
decss
is
written
it
quickly
can
be
sent
all
over
the
world
every
recipient
is
capable
not
only
of
decrypting
and
perfectly
copying
plaintiffs
copyrighted
dvds
but
also
of
retransmitting
perfect
copies
of
decss
and
thus
enabling
every
recipient
to
do
the
same
the
process
potentially
is
exponential
rather
than
linear
indeed
the
difference
is
illustrated
by
comparison
of
two
epidemiological
models
describing
the
spread
of
different
kinds
of
disease
in
a
common
source
epidemic
as
where
members
of
a
population
contract
a
disease
from
a
poisoned
well
the
disease
spreads
only
by
exposure
to
the
common
source
if
one
eliminates
the
source
or
closes
the
contaminated
well
the
epidemic
is
stopped
in
a
propagated
outbreak
epidemic
on
the
other
hand
the
disease
spreads
from
person
to
person
hence
finding
the
initial
source
of
infection
accomplishes
little
as
the
disease
continues
to
spread
even
if
the
initial
source
is
this
is
a
very
good
point
and
one
that
the
critics
of
the
dmca
sometimes
gloss
over
too
quickly
the
structure
of
digital
replication
is
indeed
different
from
the
old
centralized
model
of
copying
and
distribution
instead
of
tracing
all
illicit
copies
back
to
a
single
infringing
printing
press
we
face
the
fear
that
the
machinery
of
piracy
can
be
copied
just
as
fast
as
the
copies
it
allows
us
to
make
it
is
here
that
the
defendants
lose
the
battle
of
the
metaphors
yes
code
is
speech
it
conveys
information
but
viruses
are
codes
and
they
convey
information
too
judge
kaplan
explicitly
invokes
this
comparison
several
times
biological
viruses
are
tools
for
the
replication
of
genetic
information
they
subvert
their
hosts
cellular
programming
to
make
copies
of
themselves
just
as
a
computer
virus
hijacks
an
infected
computer
and
causes
it
to
send
out
more
copies
of
the
virus
true
decss
requires
human
intervention
to
download
the
program
and
use
it
yet
from
judge
kaplan
language
it
is
evident
that
he
sees
the
program
not
as
an
act
of
expression
but
as
a
virus
spreading
like
wildfire
seen
this
way
the
individual
choices
to
download
or
redistribute
are
simply
the
program
method
of
spreading
itself
like
the
irritation
produced
by
the
cold
virus
that
encourages
sneezes
and
coughs
thereby
transmitting
the
illness
to
others
just
as
in
an
epidemic
the
harshest
measures
are
called
for
there
is
no
poisoned
well
here
no
pirate
with
a
printing
press
we
can
shut
down
anyone
is
potentially
an
infringer
individuals
can
not
be
presumed
to
be
healthy
we
can
not
give
their
immune
systems
or
their
motives
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
instead
we
must
see
them
as
potential
carriers
the
healthy
must
be
quarantined
as
well
as
the
sick
facing
such
a
danger
judge
kaplan
agrees
that
congress
needed
to
be
draconian
we
can
not
wait
for
illegal
copying
we
must
strike
preemptively
at
the
technology
that
might
enable
it
there
is
no
place
for
inquiries
into
intent
here
no
way
that
we
can
restrict
liability
to
those
who
actually
provide
the
program
thus
though
code
is
speech
and
the
dmca
does
incidentally
restrict
expression
judge
kaplan
concludes
that
its
restraints
are
no
greater
than
is
necessary
there
are
three
questions
here
the
first
is
whether
congress
was
right
the
second
is
whether
in
the
context
of
the
movie
industry
we
can
see
evidence
of
the
evil
it
needed
to
combat
the
third
question
is
very
different
whether
the
dmca
is
constitutional
in
my
opinion
the
answer
to
questions
one
and
two
is
no
for
the
reasons
outlined
in
chapter
analysis
of
the
internet
threat
yes
cheaper
copying
can
increase
the
rate
of
illicit
copying
but
it
also
lowers
advertising
costs
and
offers
new
business
models
netflix
downloads
on
demand
viral
distribution
of
trailers
and
so
on
the
technology
helps
as
well
as
hurts
it
does
not
help
the
movie
industry
as
much
as
it
might
help
the
music
industry
which
can
more
easily
distribute
its
products
over
the
internet
but
the
internet
also
does
not
pose
as
much
danger
to
movies
as
it
does
to
music
the
movie
industry
doomsaying
aside
there
is
no
exact
movie
equivalent
of
napster
and
there
is
unlikely
to
be
one
in
the
near
this
is
not
just
because
movies
are
longer
and
harder
to
download
than
songs
it
is
because
most
people
only
watch
a
film
once
most
people
do
not
want
a
library
of
two
thousand
films
to
play
again
and
again
music
is
a
repeated
experience
good
in
a
way
that
movies
simply
are
not
and
that
social
fact
profoundly
affects
the
likelihood
of
downloading
as
opposed
to
rental
the
transient
song
on
a
radio
or
an
internet
stream
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
possessing
the
song
permanently
something
which
costs
a
lot
more
apart
from
movies
which
can
be
used
to
induce
catatonia
in
one
progeny
time
and
again
and
a
few
classic
favorites
most
people
do
not
want
to
own
movies
watching
the
film
on
television
or
renting
it
for
a
night
is
perfectly
satisfactory
both
of
these
involve
little
hassle
or
cost
the
content
industries
are
fond
of
saying
you
can
not
compete
with
free
but
this
is
simply
not
true
cheap
and
easily
acquired
goods
of
certified
quality
compete
very
well
with
free
goods
of
uncertain
quality
whose
acquisition
involves
some
difficulty
this
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
the
movie
companies
were
wrong
in
the
sony
case
thus
while
judge
kaplan
discussion
of
the
looming
digital
black
death
is
nicely
apocalyptic
it
does
not
seem
very
accurate
how
many
of
your
friends
download
movies
illicitly
over
the
internet
let
alone
movies
that
were
ripped
from
dvds
yes
it
can
be
done
but
the
actual
descriptions
of
the
process
in
the
reimerdes
case
smack
more
of
bathos
than
terror
although
the
process
is
computationally
intensive
plaintiffs
expert
decrypted
a
copy
of
sleepless
in
seattle
in
to
minutes
the
decryption
of
a
protected
dvd
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
tale
as
the
decrypted
file
is
very
large
one
solution
to
this
problem
however
is
divx
a
compression
utility
available
on
the
internet
that
is
promoted
as
a
means
of
compressing
decrypted
motion
picture
files
to
manageable
size
while
the
compressed
sound
and
graphic
files
then
must
be
synchronized
a
tedious
process
that
took
plaintiffs
expert
between
and
hours
the
task
is
entirely
feasible
at
trial
defendants
repeated
as
if
it
were
a
mantra
the
refrain
that
plaintiffs
as
they
stipulated
have
no
direct
evidence
of
a
specific
occasion
on
which
any
person
decrypted
a
copyrighted
motion
picture
with
decss
and
transmitted
it
over
the
internet
but
that
is
unpersuasive
plaintiffs
expert
expended
very
little
effort
to
find
someone
in
an
irc
chat
room
who
exchanged
a
compressed
decrypted
copy
of
the
matrix
one
of
copyrighted
motion
pictures
for
a
copy
of
sleepless
in
seattle
while
the
simultaneous
electronic
exchange
of
the
two
movies
took
approximately
six
hours
the
computers
required
little
operator
attention
during
the
interim
so
the
epidemic
threat
that
hangs
over
the
movie
industry
consists
of
the
danger
that
someone
will
spend
fifteen
minutes
decrypting
and
ten
to
twenty
hours
tediously
synchronizing
a
movie
that
is
then
available
for
a
speedy
download
admittedly
someone
only
needs
to
do
the
synchronizing
once
there
are
newer
tools
that
make
the
task
easier
and
we
could
improve
the
download
time
but
even
so
would
you
bother
faced
with
the
colossal
expense
and
hassle
of
renting
the
same
movie
at
blockbuster
for
some
consumers
might
prefer
this
process
i
suppose
but
i
would
not
sell
my
shares
in
movie
studios
quite
yet
in
fact
the
real
threat
to
movie
studios
is
the
scale
criminal
distribution
of
illicitly
copied
dvds
copied
bit
for
bit
from
the
original
the
distributors
of
those
do
not
need
to
use
programs
like
decss
a
more
distant
threat
comes
from
legal
recordings
from
television
made
on
tivo
and
replaytvs
where
consumers
actions
are
legal
and
css
is
not
an
issue
so
far
as
we
can
tell
there
is
no
measurable
effect
of
illicit
digital
downloads
on
sales
or
rentals
of
dvds
we
could
go
through
the
process
judge
kaplan
describes
i
suppose
just
as
when
the
vcr
was
invented
we
could
have
taped
movies
from
television
and
swapped
them
with
our
friends
but
as
the
movie
studios
discovered
after
the
sony
case
most
of
us
would
rather
just
rent
the
movie
because
something
is
possible
does
not
mean
it
will
happen
so
in
my
view
congress
generally
overestimated
the
threat
posed
by
the
digital
world
and
underestimated
the
benefits
in
addition
the
movie
industry
is
a
weak
place
to
make
the
case
for
the
necessity
of
the
dmca
fine
but
that
is
not
the
legal
issue
here
the
constitutionality
of
the
dmca
does
not
turn
on
whether
the
dmca
was
a
good
idea
that
is
not
the
decision
to
make
the
question
is
not
even
whether
the
particular
industry
involved
is
in
reality
facing
much
of
a
threat
from
digital
downloading
the
law
after
all
exists
for
all
digital
works
not
just
the
ones
at
issue
here
the
question
is
whether
the
restriction
on
speech
imposed
by
the
dmca
was
no
greater
than
is
essential
and
that
is
a
harder
question
i
still
disagree
with
judge
kaplan
a
more
narrowly
tailored
statute
could
have
accomplished
the
dmca
legitimate
goals
without
impinging
as
greatly
on
expression
i
think
that
the
rhetoric
of
the
internet
threat
blinded
judge
kaplan
to
some
important
issues
and
led
him
to
overestimate
the
danger
and
thus
the
severity
of
the
measures
necessary
to
combat
it
thus
even
under
the
code
is
speech
part
of
the
analysis
i
think
the
dmca
fails
first
amendment
scrutiny
but
if
we
are
confining
ourselves
to
the
expression
inherent
in
the
software
itself
i
acknowledge
that
it
is
a
close
call
sadly
judge
kaplan
spent
much
less
time
on
the
other
first
amendment
argument
against
the
dmca
that
it
is
unconstitutional
because
it
gives
copyright
holders
a
new
intellectual
property
entitlement
created
by
congress
under
the
copyright
clause
a
legal
power
to
deprive
users
of
a
constitutionally
required
limitation
on
copyright
exclusive
rights
in
my
view
he
also
framed
the
argument
wrongly
when
he
did
discuss
it
to
be
fair
these
problems
can
partly
be
traced
to
the
fact
that
the
defendants
spent
most
of
their
energy
on
the
argument
that
code
was
expression
paying
less
attention
to
everything
else
as
judge
kaplan
explained
it
the
claim
was
that
the
dmca
might
have
the
effect
of
restricting
an
alleged
fair
use
right
of
access
to
copyrighted
material
predictably
enough
he
responded
that
there
was
no
such
right
of
access
copyright
holders
could
always
lock
up
the
book
or
restrict
entrance
to
the
gallery
in
any
event
while
fair
use
of
dvds
might
be
curtailed
he
argued
that
most
movies
are
also
available
on
videotape
even
if
the
film
were
only
available
on
dvd
the
prospective
fair
user
could
write
down
the
words
and
quote
them
or
record
the
sound
from
the
screen
finally
judge
kaplan
pointed
out
that
even
if
the
dmca
might
allow
a
significant
erosion
of
fair
use
to
develop
over
time
such
a
problem
was
not
present
here
those
making
first
amendment
claims
are
sometimes
allowed
by
courts
to
show
that
even
if
the
law
as
it
applied
to
them
were
constitutional
it
would
restrict
the
first
amendment
rights
of
others
judge
kaplan
declined
to
apply
that
doctrine
here
in
effect
he
said
come
back
when
there
is
a
problem
on
appeal
the
case
was
decided
by
a
panel
led
by
judge
jon
newman
here
the
fair
use
argument
received
more
attention
but
the
result
was
the
same
come
back
when
there
is
a
problem
significantly
both
courts
pointed
out
another
concern
the
dmca
could
effectively
make
copyright
perpetual
because
even
though
the
copyright
term
would
expire
the
legally
protected
encryption
would
continue
and
tools
such
as
decss
which
would
have
allowed
access
to
the
public
domain
work
would
be
this
is
a
major
issue
because
it
appears
to
violate
both
the
first
amendment
and
the
copyright
clause
requirement
of
a
limited
time
the
defendants
did
not
spend
adequate
time
on
this
argument
however
and
the
courts
again
left
it
for
later
consideration
the
court
of
appeals
saw
the
defendants
argument
in
just
the
same
way
as
judge
kaplan
had
seen
it
a
claim
that
there
was
a
fair
use
right
of
actual
access
to
the
finest
version
of
every
work
in
every
medium
on
which
the
dmca
put
a
practical
limitation
such
a
claim
was
easy
to
dismiss
there
was
no
such
right
of
guaranteed
practical
access
copyright
owners
could
restrict
the
practical
ability
to
exercise
fair
use
in
many
ways
without
the
constitution
being
involved
in
addition
in
a
world
where
copyrighted
content
is
frequently
available
in
both
analog
and
digital
form
the
actual
effects
of
the
dmca
might
be
trivial
and
were
in
any
event
constitutionally
acceptable
judge
newman
repeated
judge
kaplan
point
that
one
could
always
make
fair
use
of
the
work
in
a
way
the
dmca
did
not
reach
such
as
by
videotaping
a
picture
of
the
screen
the
fact
that
the
resulting
copy
will
not
be
as
perfect
or
as
manipulable
as
a
digital
copy
obtained
by
having
direct
access
to
the
dvd
movie
in
its
digital
form
provides
no
basis
for
a
claim
of
unconstitutional
limitation
of
fair
use
a
film
critic
making
fair
use
of
a
movie
by
quoting
selected
lines
of
dialogue
has
no
constitutionally
valid
claim
that
the
review
in
print
or
on
television
would
be
technologically
superior
if
the
reviewer
had
not
been
prevented
from
using
a
movie
camera
in
the
theater
nor
has
an
art
student
a
valid
constitutional
claim
to
fair
use
of
a
painting
by
photographing
it
in
a
museum
fair
use
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
guarantee
of
access
to
copyrighted
material
in
order
to
copy
it
by
the
fair
user
preferred
technique
or
in
the
format
of
the
original
once
the
issue
is
framed
this
way
the
case
has
been
lost
i
would
argue
that
there
are
three
baseline
errors
here
a
focus
on
affirmative
rights
of
access
as
opposed
to
limits
on
congress
power
in
handing
out
exclusive
rights
over
expression
without
their
constitutionally
necessary
limitations
a
focus
on
practical
effects
of
the
provisions
rather
than
on
formal
constitutional
limitations
on
the
copyright
system
over
all
classes
of
works
and
a
confusion
between
intellectual
property
rights
and
physical
property
rights
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
jefferson
warning
discussed
in
chapter
the
question
is
not
whether
users
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
of
practical
access
to
a
preferred
version
of
a
work
the
question
is
whether
it
violates
the
first
amendment
for
congress
to
give
to
copyright
holders
an
intellectual
property
right
to
exempt
their
copyrighted
works
in
some
formats
from
fair
use
and
other
provisions
that
are
necessary
for
copyright
law
in
general
to
be
constitutional
remember
my
earlier
example
what
if
congress
amended
section
to
say
any
copyright
owner
can
make
it
illegal
to
make
a
fair
use
of
a
copyrighted
work
by
putting
a
red
dot
on
their
books
records
and
films
before
selling
them
it
shall
be
a
crime
to
circumvent
the
red
dot
even
if
but
for
the
dot
the
use
would
have
been
fair
this
statute
i
think
is
clearly
unconstitutional
it
would
be
no
answer
to
say
that
some
owners
will
not
use
the
red
dot
and
even
for
those
that
do
there
will
be
older
dotless
versions
still
available
it
is
irrelevant
that
i
might
be
able
to
copy
down
the
crucial
lines
of
the
book
over
your
shoulder
while
you
read
it
and
thus
claim
that
i
personally
had
not
circumvented
the
dot
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
does
not
turn
on
whether
the
dots
might
fall
off
because
of
bad
adhesive
or
whether
there
are
many
secondhand
bookstores
in
the
area
in
which
undotted
volumes
can
be
found
even
if
the
red
dot
rule
were
only
to
be
applied
to
hardback
books
or
graphic
novels
or
cassette
tapes
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
nor
do
we
have
to
wait
until
the
entire
marketplace
is
dominated
by
products
before
considering
the
issue
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
even
before
the
red
dot
rule
copyright
holders
could
always
have
hidden
their
works
or
locked
them
in
safes
or
even
negotiated
individual
contracts
with
the
purchasers
that
have
the
effect
of
limiting
fair
use
that
way
of
framing
it
just
misunderstands
the
issue
on
a
fundamental
level
the
claim
is
not
about
the
happenstance
of
practical
access
or
the
way
that
a
copyright
holder
can
use
physical
control
of
an
object
or
existing
tangible
property
rights
to
undercut
fair
use
the
point
is
that
congress
violates
the
first
amendment
when
with
respect
to
any
work
it
gives
me
an
intellectual
property
right
to
prohibit
copying
and
distribution
of
an
expressive
work
sold
in
the
marketplace
and
an
additional
legal
power
to
opt
out
of
the
limitations
contained
in
section
over
that
work
the
bundle
of
rights
conveyed
by
the
dmca
does
exactly
that
it
is
not
the
dmca
alone
that
we
must
analyze
the
question
is
whether
congress
can
give
the
exclusive
rights
contained
in
section
of
the
copyright
act
over
a
particular
class
of
works
say
digital
works
if
it
also
gives
a
new
right
to
prohibit
citizens
from
gaining
access
to
those
works
for
the
purposes
of
making
a
fair
use
if
judge
kaplan
and
judge
newman
are
correct
then
the
dmca
gives
an
entirely
new
intellectual
property
right
technically
a
legal
power
to
the
copyright
holders
to
do
exactly
that
to
put
it
the
other
way
around
the
dmca
subtracts
from
the
citizen
bundle
of
entitlements
under
federal
copyright
law
the
right
technically
lawyers
would
call
it
a
privilege
to
gain
access
to
a
work
legally
in
his
possession
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
fair
use
it
is
that
rule
change
that
is
unconstitutional
i
would
argue
and
the
way
judge
kaplan
and
judge
newman
frame
that
issue
makes
them
miss
the
point
framing
is
important
the
confusions
that
i
have
talked
about
in
this
book
all
make
an
appearance
it
starts
with
the
whole
controversy
being
framed
by
the
internet
threat
story
line
from
chapter
because
judge
kaplan
is
convinced
that
every
citizen
is
now
a
potential
infringer
a
potentially
infectious
virus
carrier
he
is
ill
disposed
to
listen
to
claims
about
fair
use
civil
liberties
claims
do
not
do
very
well
in
epidemics
it
is
only
right
for
him
to
defer
to
congress
perception
of
the
problem
and
the
solution
of
course
but
he
buys
so
deeply
into
the
magnitude
of
the
threat
the
extent
of
the
potential
piracy
pandemic
that
it
is
very
hard
for
him
to
take
seriously
the
idea
that
even
here
there
is
a
legitimate
constitutional
fair
use
claim
the
sony
axiom
from
chapter
is
also
ignored
or
at
least
undervalued
as
i
pointed
out
there
without
a
robust
set
of
exceptions
and
limitations
on
copyright
the
idea
that
cheaper
copying
requires
greater
control
will
inexorably
drive
us
toward
the
position
that
the
technologies
of
cheaper
reproduction
must
be
put
under
the
governance
of
copyright
holders
the
dmca
continues
that
logic
its
drafters
concluded
that
the
right
to
get
access
to
digital
works
for
purposes
of
making
a
fair
use
must
be
taken
from
the
bundle
of
rights
possessed
by
citizens
while
the
right
to
enjoin
both
access
and
the
technologies
of
access
is
added
to
those
of
copyright
holders
never
mind
the
correctness
of
such
a
conclusion
as
a
matter
of
policy
are
there
constitutional
limitations
on
congress
taking
such
an
action
kaplan
and
newman
in
effect
tell
us
not
yet
more
important
than
the
perception
of
the
threat
is
the
understanding
of
what
intellectual
property
is
all
about
in
chapter
jefferson
warned
us
that
intellectual
property
rights
are
not
like
physical
property
rights
in
analyzing
the
dmca
where
do
we
turn
for
analogies
to
physical
property
violence
and
theft
the
cases
analyzing
the
dmca
are
full
of
analogies
to
trespass
to
breaking
and
entering
to
burglars
tools
and
to
safecrackers
private
property
carries
a
lot
of
baggage
with
it
but
we
know
it
well
it
is
the
place
we
naturally
turn
for
insight
even
i
in
order
to
point
out
some
of
the
difficulties
with
those
analogies
had
to
turn
to
farmers
and
barbed
wire
and
public
along
highways
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
analogies
they
help
us
understand
things
that
are
new
by
comparing
them
to
things
we
think
we
understand
better
analogies
are
only
bad
when
they
ignore
the
key
difference
between
the
two
things
being
analyzed
that
is
what
happens
here
jefferson
reminded
us
that
intellectual
property
rights
are
clearly
artifacts
of
state
creation
monopolies
whose
internal
limitations
in
scope
duration
and
so
on
are
just
as
important
as
the
rights
themselves
jefferson
doubts
whether
even
property
rights
over
land
can
be
understood
as
natural
and
absolute
copyrights
and
patents
which
cover
subject
matter
that
can
be
infinitely
reproduced
without
diminishing
its
substance
clearly
can
not
they
frequently
involve
a
claim
to
control
purchasers
behavior
with
respect
to
some
aspect
of
an
artifact
after
it
has
been
sold
to
them
in
the
marketplace
making
simpleminded
analogies
to
breaking
and
entering
inappropriate
the
extent
of
the
property
in
question
is
precisely
the
issue
in
dispute
when
johansen
was
tried
in
norway
under
the
national
computer
crime
law
the
court
laconically
observed
that
he
had
bought
the
dvds
and
one
can
not
break
into
one
own
property
effectively
turning
the
analogy
on
its
head
jefferson
starts
from
the
baseline
that
monopoly
is
the
exception
and
freedom
is
the
rule
any
limitations
on
that
freedom
have
to
be
justified
that
is
why
he
always
discusses
the
right
and
the
limitations
on
the
right
as
an
inseparable
pair
one
can
not
discuss
them
in
isolation
kaplan
and
newman
are
fine
thoughtful
judges
they
do
not
altogether
ignore
those
points
but
look
how
the
analysis
is
set
up
at
several
points
in
the
discussion
there
seems
to
be
the
assumption
that
copyright
owners
have
entitlements
to
total
control
as
of
right
and
that
fair
use
is
a
mere
lucky
loophole
which
because
it
can
be
negated
by
the
happenstance
of
whether
one
can
get
physical
access
can
hardly
have
major
first
amendment
status
they
keep
pointing
out
that
physical
control
and
tangible
property
rights
frequently
allow
copyright
holders
to
make
fair
use
impracticable
and
so
what
jefferson
might
have
responded
this
is
a
classic
non
sequitur
the
question
is
whether
the
congress
has
the
power
to
add
a
new
right
of
denial
to
the
intellectual
property
monopoly
it
is
constructing
undermining
as
to
some
works
and
some
fair
uses
the
balance
that
the
law
sets
up
the
citizen
is
not
pleading
for
a
new
right
of
access
trumping
all
physical
restraint
and
tangible
property
rights
the
citizen
is
claiming
that
congress
has
no
power
to
give
exclusive
rights
to
restrain
copying
of
digital
content
while
simultaneously
taking
away
the
citizen
existing
right
to
get
access
to
that
content
for
the
purposes
of
fair
use
at
least
in
those
cases
where
access
is
physically
possible
and
violates
no
other
property
right
real
or
intellectual
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
united
states
to
break
into
president
nixon
desk
to
get
me
his
tapes
buy
me
a
tape
recorder
or
give
me
a
right
to
minutes
on
the
broadcast
airwaves
to
play
them
but
if
i
can
get
access
to
the
tapes
legally
it
does
forbid
the
government
from
giving
president
nixon
the
power
to
put
a
red
dot
on
those
tapes
and
thus
claim
an
intellectual
property
right
to
stop
me
playing
them
on
tv
or
digitizing
them
to
make
the
sounds
clearer
the
restraints
imposed
by
physical
happenstance
and
tangible
property
rights
are
different
from
those
imposed
by
copyright
a
congressionally
created
monopoly
over
expression
we
can
not
assume
because
one
is
constitutionally
acceptable
that
the
others
are
too
jefferson
understood
that
and
his
analysis
can
help
us
even
in
a
constitutional
conflict
over
a
technology
he
could
hardly
have
dreamt
of
though
perhaps
with
jefferson
this
is
a
bad
bet
the
same
point
comes
up
in
a
different
way
when
the
court
disconnects
the
fair
use
discussion
from
the
exclusive
rights
discussion
the
question
is
not
do
i
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
of
physical
access
to
a
preferred
version
of
a
movie
so
as
to
make
my
task
easy
that
gets
the
court
caught
up
in
questions
of
when
a
majority
of
movies
will
only
be
available
on
dvd
or
how
poor
a
substitute
the
analog
version
would
be
or
how
many
fair
uses
will
require
actually
cutting
a
digital
fence
but
all
of
these
inquiries
miss
the
point
the
question
is
can
congress
hand
out
the
exclusive
rights
of
copyright
over
digital
works
if
it
does
not
accompany
those
rights
with
the
suite
of
limitations
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
saves
copyright
from
violating
the
first
amendment
the
proportion
of
digital
works
to
the
total
number
of
works
produced
in
other
formats
is
irrelevant
as
to
these
works
the
rule
is
unconstitutional
but
what
about
the
number
or
proportion
of
types
of
fair
uses
affected
that
is
more
relevant
but
still
not
dispositive
in
the
way
kaplan
and
newman
imagined
true
not
every
trivial
statutory
modification
of
fair
use
makes
copyright
unconstitutional
but
this
is
not
a
trivial
modification
over
an
entire
class
of
works
copyright
owners
are
given
a
legal
power
to
deprive
users
of
their
privilege
to
gain
otherwise
lawful
access
for
the
purposes
of
fair
use
if
you
give
the
digital
filmmaker
the
exclusive
rights
of
copyright
but
forbid
the
film
professor
from
going
through
the
otherwise
lawful
process
of
parodying
or
quoting
that
rule
is
unconstitutional
no
matter
how
many
other
fair
uses
are
unaffected
if
the
copyright
law
were
amended
to
forbid
journalists
playing
on
a
friday
excerpts
of
legally
acquired
tapes
made
by
presidents
whose
last
name
begins
with
n
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
the
legal
implementation
of
this
conclusion
would
be
simple
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
punish
an
individual
for
gaining
access
in
order
to
make
a
fair
use
however
if
they
cut
down
the
digital
fence
to
make
illicit
copies
both
the
cutting
and
the
copying
would
be
illegal
but
what
about
the
prohibition
of
trafficking
in
digital
wire
cutters
technologies
such
as
decss
there
the
constitutional
question
is
harder
i
would
argue
that
the
first
amendment
requires
an
interpretation
of
the
antitrafficking
provisions
that
comes
closer
to
the
ruling
in
the
sony
case
if
johansen
did
indeed
make
decss
to
play
dvds
on
his
linux
computer
and
if
that
were
indeed
a
substantial
noninfringing
use
then
it
can
not
be
illegal
for
him
to
develop
the
technology
but
i
accept
that
this
is
a
harder
line
to
draw
constitutionally
about
my
first
conclusion
though
i
think
the
argument
is
both
strong
and
clear
ironically
there
is
some
support
for
my
claim
and
it
comes
from
an
even
higher
if
not
uniformly
more
thoughtful
set
of
judges
than
newman
and
kaplan
in
the
depressing
case
of
eldred
ashcroft
the
supreme
court
upheld
retrospective
copyright
term
extensions
against
a
variety
of
constitutional
challenges
full
disclosure
i
assisted
in
the
preparation
of
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
the
case
one
of
those
challenges
was
based
on
the
first
amendment
the
fairly
reasonable
claim
was
that
congress
could
not
retroactively
lock
up
an
entire
swathe
of
culture
that
had
already
been
produced
such
a
law
would
be
all
restraint
of
expression
performance
republication
adaption
and
so
on
with
no
incentive
benefits
the
court
was
unconvinced
but
it
did
say
to
the
extent
such
assertions
raise
first
amendment
concerns
copyright
free
speech
safeguards
are
generally
adequate
to
address
them
we
recognize
that
the
circuit
spoke
too
broadly
when
it
declared
copyrights
categorically
immune
from
challenges
under
the
first
amendment
but
when
as
in
this
case
congress
has
not
altered
the
traditional
contours
of
copyright
protection
further
first
amendment
scrutiny
is
the
dmca
of
course
does
exactly
this
as
to
digital
works
it
alters
the
traditional
contours
of
copyright
protection
in
a
way
that
affects
copyright
free
speech
safeguards
that
is
what
the
farmers
tale
was
all
about
perhaps
one
day
in
a
case
not
involving
a
norwegian
teenager
a
hacker
magazine
run
by
a
editor
with
an
orwellian
nom
de
plume
and
an
obscure
technology
that
is
accused
of
posing
apocalyptic
threats
to
the
american
film
industry
that
point
will
come
out
more
clearly
but
the
issue
of
speech
regulation
is
only
half
of
the
story
intellectual
property
rights
over
digital
technologies
affect
not
only
speech
but
the
framework
of
competition
and
markets
as
well
as
the
next
example
makes
clear
the
apple
of
forbidden
knowledge
the
dmca
and
competition
you
could
tell
it
was
a
bizarre
feud
by
the
statement
apple
issued
one
strangely
at
odds
with
the
californian
the
company
normally
projects
we
are
stunned
that
realnetworks
has
adopted
the
tactics
and
ethics
of
a
hacker
to
break
into
the
ipod
and
we
are
investigating
the
implications
of
their
actions
under
the
dmca
and
other
laws
what
vile
thing
had
realnetworks
done
they
had
developed
a
program
called
harmony
that
would
allow
ipod
owners
to
buy
songs
from
real
music
store
and
play
them
on
their
own
ipods
it
so
why
all
the
outrage
it
turns
out
that
like
the
story
of
decss
this
little
controversy
has
a
lot
to
teach
us
about
the
landscape
of
intellectual
property
disputes
about
the
mental
topography
of
the
economy
but
where
the
decss
case
was
a
war
of
metaphors
around
the
boundaries
of
freedom
of
expression
the
ipod
story
is
about
ways
in
which
intellectual
property
marks
the
limits
of
competition
apple
ipods
can
be
used
to
store
all
kinds
of
material
from
word
processing
documents
to
files
if
you
want
to
use
these
popular
digital
music
players
to
download
music
though
you
have
only
one
source
apple
itunes
service
which
offers
songs
at
cents
a
pop
in
the
united
states
pence
in
the
united
kingdom
if
you
try
to
download
material
from
any
other
service
the
ipod
will
refuse
to
play
it
or
at
least
that
had
been
the
case
until
real
managed
to
make
their
harmony
service
compatible
real
actions
meant
that
consumers
had
two
sources
of
protected
music
for
their
ipods
presumably
all
the
virtues
of
competition
including
improved
variety
and
lowered
prices
would
follow
the
ipod
owners
would
be
happy
but
apple
was
not
the
first
lesson
of
the
story
is
how
strangely
people
use
the
metaphors
of
tangible
property
in
disputes
how
exactly
had
real
broken
into
the
ipod
it
had
not
broken
into
my
ipod
which
is
after
all
my
ipod
if
i
want
to
use
service
to
download
music
to
my
own
device
where
the
breaking
and
entering
what
real
had
done
was
make
the
ipod
interoperable
with
another
format
if
boyle
word
processing
program
can
convert
microsoft
word
files
into
boyle
format
allowing
word
users
to
switch
programs
am
i
breaking
into
word
well
microsoft
might
think
so
but
most
of
us
do
not
so
leaving
aside
the
legal
claim
for
a
moment
where
is
the
ethical
foul
apple
was
saying
and
apparently
believed
that
real
had
broken
into
something
different
from
my
ipod
or
your
ipod
they
had
broken
into
the
idea
of
an
ipod
i
imagine
a
small
platonic
white
rectangle
presumably
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
steve
jobs
their
true
sin
was
trying
to
understand
the
ipod
so
that
they
could
make
it
do
things
that
apple
did
not
want
it
to
do
as
an
ethical
matter
does
figuring
out
how
things
work
in
order
to
compete
with
the
original
manufacturer
count
as
breaking
and
entering
in
the
strange
netherworld
between
hardware
and
software
device
and
product
the
answer
is
often
a
morally
heartfelt
yes
i
would
stress
morally
heartfelt
it
is
true
manufacturers
want
to
make
lots
of
money
and
would
rather
not
have
competitors
bob
young
of
red
hat
claims
every
business
person
wakes
up
in
the
morning
and
says
can
i
become
a
monopolist
beyond
that
though
innovators
actually
come
to
believe
that
they
have
the
moral
right
to
control
the
uses
of
their
goods
after
they
are
sold
this
is
your
ipod
it
apple
ipod
yet
even
if
they
believe
this
we
do
have
to
agree
in
the
material
world
when
a
razor
manufacturer
claims
that
a
generic
razor
blade
maker
is
stealing
my
customers
by
making
compatible
blades
we
simply
laugh
the
hacking
there
consists
of
looking
at
the
razor
and
manufacturing
a
blade
that
will
fit
to
say
this
is
somehow
immoral
seems
laughable
is
the
conclusion
changed
when
the
information
about
compatibility
is
inscribed
in
binary
code
and
silicon
circuits
rather
than
the
molded
plastic
of
a
razor
cartridge
what
if
ensuring
the
fit
between
the
two
products
is
not
a
matter
of
making
sure
the
new
blades
snugly
connect
to
the
razor
but
of
making
sure
the
software
embedded
in
my
generic
product
sends
the
right
code
to
the
original
product
in
order
to
be
recognized
our
moral
intuitions
are
a
little
less
confident
here
all
kinds
of
bad
policy
can
flourish
in
that
area
of
moral
uncertainty
this
leads
us
to
the
law
surely
apple
suggestion
that
the
dmca
might
prohibit
what
real
had
done
is
as
baseless
as
their
moral
argument
in
the
united
states
the
answer
is
probably
at
least
if
the
courts
continue
in
the
direction
they
are
currently
taking
but
it
is
a
closer
call
than
you
would
think
internationally
the
answer
is
even
less
certain
that
is
where
the
ipod
war
provides
its
second
lesson
think
for
a
moment
about
the
way
that
the
law
shapes
the
business
choices
in
this
dispute
in
a
competitive
market
apple
would
choose
whether
to
make
the
ipod
an
open
platform
able
to
work
with
everyone
music
service
or
to
try
to
keep
it
closed
hoping
to
extract
more
money
by
using
consumers
loyalty
to
the
hardware
to
drive
them
to
the
tied
music
service
if
they
attempted
to
keep
it
closed
competitors
would
try
to
make
compatible
products
acting
like
the
manufacturers
of
generic
razor
blades
or
printer
cartridges
the
war
would
be
fought
out
on
the
hardware
and
software
level
with
the
manufacturer
of
the
platform
constantly
seeking
to
make
the
competing
products
incompatible
to
their
quality
and
to
use
fear
uncertainty
and
doubt
to
stop
consumers
from
switching
apple
actual
words
were
when
we
update
our
ipod
software
from
time
to
time
it
is
highly
likely
that
real
harmony
technology
will
cease
to
work
with
current
and
future
ipods
meanwhile
the
competitors
would
race
to
untangle
the
knots
as
fast
as
the
platform
manufacturer
could
tie
them
if
the
consumers
got
irritated
enough
they
could
give
up
their
sunk
costs
and
switch
to
another
product
altogether
all
of
this
seems
fine
even
if
it
represents
the
kind
of
socially
wasteful
arms
race
that
led
critics
of
capitalism
to
prophesy
its
inevitable
doom
competition
is
good
and
competition
will
often
require
interoperability
but
what
do
we
mean
by
competition
is
it
competition
if
i
assassinate
your
employees
or
poison
the
food
in
your
restaurant
if
i
trespass
on
your
land
in
order
to
sell
a
competing
product
if
i
break
into
your
safe
to
steal
your
trade
secrets
use
my
monopoly
position
in
the
market
to
impose
resale
price
agreements
or
violate
your
patent
it
is
the
law
that
draws
the
line
between
competition
and
theft
between
virtuous
competitive
imitation
and
illicit
piracy
sometimes
we
need
to
give
innovators
property
rights
that
allow
them
to
prevent
from
free
riding
on
their
efforts
we
have
to
do
so
because
it
is
necessary
to
encourage
future
innovation
on
the
other
hand
sometimes
we
not
only
allow
the
to
free
ride
we
positively
encourage
it
believing
that
this
is
an
integral
part
of
competition
and
that
there
are
adequate
incentives
to
encourage
innovation
without
the
state
stepping
in
intellectual
property
policy
indeed
a
large
part
of
the
policy
behind
all
property
rights
is
about
drawing
the
line
between
the
two
situations
too
far
in
one
direction
and
innovation
suffers
because
potential
investors
realize
good
ideas
will
immediately
be
copied
too
far
in
the
other
direction
and
monopolies
hurt
both
competition
and
future
innovation
imagine
you
are
the
first
person
to
invest
in
getting
the
public
to
eat
burritos
for
breakfast
or
to
place
a
petrol
station
at
a
certain
crossroads
or
to
clip
papers
together
with
a
folded
bit
of
wire
in
each
case
we
give
you
some
property
rights
the
vendor
may
own
a
trademarked
phrase
or
jingle
that
the
public
learns
to
associate
with
his
product
since
the
patent
office
issued
a
patent
for
the
sealed
and
crimped
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
i
described
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
even
a
patent
is
not
out
of
the
question
if
your
disgusting
concoction
is
sufficiently
novel
and
nonobvious
but
we
should
not
allow
you
to
have
a
patent
over
all
burritos
or
burritos
for
breakfast
still
less
over
the
idea
of
fast
food
as
for
the
paper
clip
maker
there
might
be
a
trademark
over
the
particular
paper
clip
but
the
idea
of
folding
wire
to
secure
paper
stays
in
the
public
domain
the
owner
of
the
petrol
station
gets
physical
ownership
of
the
land
but
can
not
stop
a
from
setting
up
shop
across
the
road
even
if
the
labor
capital
and
effort
proved
that
the
location
is
a
good
one
we
positively
encourage
imitation
in
those
cases
now
how
about
the
case
in
point
what
does
apple
get
in
the
way
of
property
rights
think
back
to
my
description
of
the
intellectual
property
system
in
chapter
they
can
get
patents
over
those
aspects
of
the
ipod
both
hardware
and
software
that
are
sufficiently
innovative
patents
are
what
we
use
to
protect
inventions
they
also
get
a
copyright
over
the
various
pieces
of
software
involved
that
protects
them
only
against
someone
who
copies
their
code
not
someone
who
writes
new
software
to
do
the
same
thing
copyrights
are
what
we
use
to
protect
original
expression
they
get
rights
under
trademark
law
over
the
name
and
perhaps
parts
of
the
design
of
the
product
maybe
the
distinctive
look
of
the
ipod
though
that
is
a
bit
more
complex
all
of
these
rights
plus
being
the
first
to
break
into
the
market
in
a
big
way
the
brilliance
of
the
design
and
the
tight
integration
between
the
hardware
and
the
service
produce
a
formidable
competitive
advantage
the
ipod
is
a
very
good
product
now
if
a
competitor
infringes
any
of
apple
rights
for
example
by
making
a
literal
copy
of
the
code
using
their
trademark
in
a
way
the
law
does
not
allow
or
infringing
on
one
of
their
patents
then
apple
can
shut
them
down
and
extract
hefty
damages
quite
right
too
but
should
they
be
able
to
prevent
someone
from
making
an
interoperable
product
provided
they
do
not
violate
any
of
these
existing
rights
in
the
process
laws
like
the
dmca
make
that
question
more
complicated
nowadays
there
is
software
in
many
many
more
products
than
you
would
imagine
your
watch
your
phone
your
printer
your
thermostat
your
garage
door
opener
your
refrigerator
your
microwave
your
television
the
odds
are
that
if
you
bought
them
in
the
last
ten
years
they
have
some
software
component
in
the
the
courts
and
congress
had
concluded
that
software
could
be
copyrighted
as
original
expression
like
a
song
or
a
novel
as
well
as
being
patented
when
it
was
novel
nonobvious
and
useful
frequently
different
aspects
of
the
same
program
will
be
covered
by
copyright
and
by
patent
but
software
is
a
machine
made
of
words
the
machine
of
the
digital
age
that
fact
already
causes
some
problems
for
our
competition
policy
will
the
exceptions
and
limitations
designed
to
deal
with
a
copyright
over
a
novel
work
adequately
when
they
are
applied
to
microsoft
windows
that
issue
was
already
unclear
with
the
dmca
we
have
added
another
crucial
problem
where
there
is
copyrighted
software
there
can
be
digital
fences
around
it
if
the
copyright
owner
can
forbid
people
to
cut
these
fences
to
gain
access
to
the
software
then
it
can
effectively
enlarge
its
monopoly
capture
tied
services
and
prohibit
generic
competition
it
was
just
this
line
of
thought
that
led
some
other
companies
to
do
more
than
merely
make
threatening
noises
about
the
dmca
lexmark
makes
printers
but
it
also
makes
lots
of
money
off
the
replacement
ink
or
toner
cartridges
for
those
printers
in
some
cases
in
fact
that
is
where
printer
companies
make
the
majority
of
their
profits
as
a
result
they
are
not
exactly
keen
on
generic
replacements
chamberlain
makes
garage
door
opener
systems
but
they
also
sell
replacements
for
the
controllers
the
little
devices
that
you
use
to
trigger
the
door
lawyers
from
both
of
those
firms
looked
at
the
dmca
and
saw
a
chance
to
do
something
most
companies
would
love
to
do
to
make
generic
competition
illegal
lexmark
designed
their
printer
program
so
that
it
would
not
accept
a
toner
cartridge
unless
it
received
the
correct
checksum
or
validation
number
so
far
this
looks
no
different
from
the
razor
manufacturer
trying
to
make
it
difficult
to
manufacture
a
compatible
replacement
blade
generic
competitors
now
had
to
embed
chips
in
their
printer
cartridges
which
would
produce
the
correct
code
otherwise
they
would
not
work
in
lexmark
printers
static
control
components
is
a
north
carolina
company
that
manufactures
chips
whose
main
function
is
to
send
the
correct
code
to
the
printer
program
with
this
chip
implanted
in
them
generic
cartridges
would
work
in
lexmark
printers
response
could
have
been
to
change
their
program
rendering
the
chip
obsolete
just
as
apple
could
change
the
itunes
software
to
lock
out
real
music
rhapsody
doing
so
would
have
been
quite
within
their
rights
indeed
it
is
a
standard
part
of
the
interoperability
wars
instead
lexmark
sued
static
controls
claiming
among
other
things
a
violation
of
the
like
apple
in
the
press
release
i
quoted
earlier
lexmark
clearly
saw
this
as
a
kind
of
digital
breaking
and
entering
this
was
their
printer
their
printer
program
their
market
for
replacement
cartridges
static
was
just
helping
a
bunch
of
cheats
camouflage
their
generic
cartridges
as
authentic
lexmark
cartridges
translated
into
the
legal
language
of
the
dmca
the
claim
is
a
little
different
but
still
recognizable
static
was
trafficking
in
a
device
that
allowed
the
circumvention
of
a
technical
protection
measure
used
to
prevent
access
to
a
copyrighted
work
namely
the
computer
program
inside
the
printer
that
is
behavior
that
the
dmca
forbids
the
garage
door
company
chamberlain
who
also
claimed
to
be
concerned
about
the
security
of
their
garage
doors
made
a
similar
argument
in
order
to
get
the
garage
door
to
open
the
generic
replacement
opener
had
to
provide
the
right
code
to
the
program
in
the
actual
motor
system
that
program
is
copyrighted
the
code
controls
access
to
it
suddenly
the
manufacturers
of
generic
printer
cartridges
and
garage
door
openers
start
to
look
rather
like
jon
johansen
surely
the
courts
did
not
accept
this
argument
bizarrely
enough
some
of
them
did
at
least
at
first
but
perhaps
it
was
not
so
bizarre
the
dmca
was
indeed
a
radical
new
law
it
did
shift
the
boundaries
of
power
between
intellectual
property
owners
and
others
and
intellectual
property
rights
are
always
about
restraining
competition
defining
what
is
legitimate
and
what
is
not
that
is
what
they
do
there
was
a
respectable
argument
that
these
devices
did
in
fact
violate
the
dmca
in
fact
it
was
respectable
enough
to
convince
a
federal
judge
the
district
court
judge
in
the
lexmark
case
concluded
that
lexmark
was
likely
to
win
on
both
the
dmca
claim
and
on
a
more
traditional
copyright
claim
and
issued
an
injunction
against
static
control
in
skylink
the
case
involving
garage
door
openers
by
contrast
the
district
court
held
that
the
universal
garage
door
opener
did
not
violate
the
dmca
both
cases
were
appealed
and
both
appeals
courts
sided
with
the
generic
manufacturers
saying
that
the
dmca
did
not
prohibit
this
kind
of
access
merely
making
a
computer
program
work
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
cafc
heard
the
skylink
appeal
in
a
remarkably
decision
the
court
effectively
took
many
of
the
positions
that
lawyers
had
argued
for
in
the
decss
case
but
they
did
so
not
to
protect
speech
but
to
protect
competition
in
fact
they
implied
that
taking
chamberlain
side
in
the
case
would
silently
overrule
the
antitrust
statutes
they
also
interpreted
the
new
right
created
by
the
dmca
so
as
to
add
an
implicit
limitation
in
their
construction
merely
gaining
access
is
not
illegal
only
gaining
access
for
the
purpose
of
violating
the
copyright
holders
rights
violates
the
statute
the
reimerdes
court
had
been
willing
to
accept
that
the
new
access
right
allows
a
copyright
holder
to
prohibit
fair
uses
as
well
as
foul
when
chamberlain
made
the
same
argument
as
to
their
garage
door
opener
program
the
cafc
was
incredulous
such
an
entitlement
as
the
one
chamberlain
claims
would
go
far
beyond
the
idea
that
the
dmca
allows
copyright
owner
to
prohibit
fair
uses
as
well
as
foul
reimerdes
supp
at
chamberlain
proposed
construction
would
allow
copyright
owners
to
prohibit
exclusively
fair
uses
even
in
the
absence
of
any
feared
foul
use
it
would
therefore
allow
any
copyright
owner
through
a
combination
of
contractual
terms
and
technological
measures
to
repeal
the
fair
use
doctrine
with
respect
to
an
individual
copyrighted
work
or
even
selected
copies
of
that
copyrighted
there
are
multiple
ironies
here
the
cafc
rarely
meets
an
intellectual
property
right
it
does
not
like
it
has
presided
over
a
expansion
of
american
patent
law
that
many
scholars
find
indefensible
but
when
for
dubious
jurisdictional
reasons
it
sorties
beyond
its
traditional
ambit
of
patent
law
it
is
stunned
by
the
potential
expansiveness
of
the
dmca
then
there
is
the
comparison
with
the
reimerdes
case
how
interesting
that
the
first
amendment
and
concerns
about
free
expression
have
comparatively
little
bite
when
applied
to
the
dmca
but
antitrust
and
concerns
about
competition
require
that
we
curtail
it
after
all
the
heart
of
johansen
argument
was
that
he
had
to
write
the
decss
program
in
order
to
play
his
own
dvds
on
his
own
computer
to
get
access
to
his
own
dvds
just
as
the
purchaser
of
a
replacement
garage
door
control
is
getting
access
to
the
program
that
operates
his
own
garage
door
indeed
johansen
criticism
of
css
was
that
it
allowed
the
movie
companies
through
a
combination
of
contractual
terms
and
technological
measures
to
repeal
the
fair
use
doctrine
with
respect
to
an
individual
copyrighted
work
corley
echoed
those
claims
of
course
the
situations
are
not
identical
the
key
limitation
in
skylink
is
that
the
court
saw
no
threat
of
foul
use
the
reimerdes
court
could
see
little
else
on
the
other
hand
the
rulings
are
not
easily
reconciled
the
skylink
court
can
not
imagine
that
congress
would
want
to
give
the
copyright
holder
a
new
property
right
to
prevent
access
unconnected
to
any
underlying
copyright
violation
as
we
have
seen
congress
chose
to
create
new
causes
of
action
for
circumvention
and
for
trafficking
in
circumvention
devices
congress
did
not
choose
to
create
new
property
rights
were
we
to
interpret
congress
words
in
a
way
that
eliminated
all
balance
and
granted
copyright
owners
carte
blanche
authority
to
preclude
all
use
congressional
intent
would
remain
unrealized
yet
arguably
that
is
exactly
what
the
reimerdes
decision
does
precisely
because
it
focuses
on
enabling
access
alone
not
access
for
the
purpose
of
violating
one
of
the
rights
of
the
copyright
holder
the
reimerdes
court
saw
a
violation
of
the
law
just
in
cutting
the
wire
or
making
a
wire
cutter
the
skylink
court
focused
on
whether
the
person
cutting
the
wire
was
going
to
trespass
once
the
cutting
was
done
in
effect
the
two
courts
disagree
on
which
of
the
options
offered
to
the
legislature
in
the
farmers
tale
was
actually
enacted
by
congress
which
court
is
correct
the
skylink
decision
strikes
me
as
sensible
it
also
makes
the
statute
constitutionally
much
more
defensible
something
that
the
skylink
court
does
not
consider
but
in
the
process
it
has
to
rewrite
the
dmca
substantially
one
should
not
presume
that
it
will
be
this
interpretation
that
will
triumph
summing
up
exaggerations
and
bipolar
disorders
in
technology
policy
let
me
return
to
the
question
with
which
i
began
the
chapter
for
many
critics
of
contemporary
intellectual
property
law
the
dmca
is
the
very
embodiment
of
all
that
is
wrong
i
still
cherish
a
friend
account
of
british
protesters
outside
the
american
embassy
in
london
singing
to
the
tune
of
the
village
people
ymca
and
holding
up
signs
calling
for
the
law
repeal
to
the
great
confusion
of
the
diplomatic
personnel
the
critics
conjure
up
a
digital
apocalypse
a
world
of
perfect
control
achieved
through
legally
backed
digital
fences
in
which
both
speech
and
competition
suffer
and
where
citizens
lose
privacy
the
privilege
of
fair
use
and
the
right
to
criticize
popular
culture
rather
than
simply
consume
it
in
their
view
the
legal
disaster
is
only
exacerbated
by
bumbling
judges
who
do
not
understand
the
technology
and
who
are
easily
fooled
by
the
rhetoric
of
the
content
companies
the
dmca
supporters
on
the
other
hand
think
criticisms
of
the
dmca
are
overblown
that
the
dark
tales
of
digital
control
are
either
paranoid
delusions
or
tendentious
exaggerations
and
that
far
from
being
excessive
the
dmca
provisions
are
not
sufficient
to
control
an
epidemic
of
illicit
copying
more
draconian
intervention
is
needed
as
for
fair
use
as
i
pointed
out
before
many
of
the
dmca
supporters
do
not
think
fair
use
is
that
important
economically
or
culturally
speaking
at
best
it
is
a
loophole
that
copyright
owners
should
have
the
right
to
close
certainly
not
an
affirmative
right
of
the
public
or
a
reserved
limitation
on
the
original
property
grant
from
the
state
who
is
right
obviously
i
disagree
profoundly
with
the
supporters
i
wrote
this
book
partly
to
explain
using
jefferson
and
macaulay
and
the
sony
case
what
was
wrong
with
their
logic
it
would
be
both
convenient
and
predictable
for
me
to
claim
that
the
dmca
is
the
intellectual
property
incarnation
of
the
antichrist
but
it
would
not
be
true
in
fact
i
would
not
even
put
the
dmca
in
the
top
three
of
bad
intellectual
property
initiatives
worldwide
and
many
of
the
fears
conjured
up
about
it
are
indeed
overblown
of
course
the
critics
have
a
point
the
dmca
is
a
very
badly
drafted
law
as
i
have
tried
to
show
here
its
key
provisions
were
probably
unnecessary
and
are
in
my
view
unconstitutional
if
coupled
with
a
number
of
other
legal
innovations
favored
by
the
content
industry
the
dmca
could
play
a
very
destructive
role
in
general
in
fact
the
farmers
tale
is
fairly
accurate
in
describing
both
the
origins
of
and
the
threats
posed
by
the
dmca
yet
the
single
largest
of
those
threats
the
idea
that
the
dmca
could
be
used
to
fence
off
large
portions
of
the
public
domain
and
to
make
the
fair
use
provisions
of
the
copyright
act
essentially
irrelevant
is
still
largely
a
threat
rather
than
a
reality
in
some
cases
fair
use
rights
are
curtailed
but
for
most
citizens
and
for
the
majority
of
media
the
dmca
has
had
relatively
little
effect
digital
rights
management
drm
certainly
exists
indeed
it
is
all
around
us
you
can
see
that
every
time
you
try
to
play
a
dvd
bought
in
another
part
of
the
world
open
an
adobe
ebook
or
copy
a
song
you
have
downloaded
from
itunes
but
so
far
the
world
of
legally
backed
digital
rights
management
has
not
brought
about
the
worst
of
the
dystopian
consequences
that
some
people
including
me
feared
might
result
in
many
cases
citizens
simply
reject
digital
rights
management
they
will
not
buy
products
that
use
it
attempts
to
introduce
it
into
music
cds
for
example
have
been
a
resounding
failure
in
other
cases
drm
has
not
been
used
in
ways
that
the
critics
feared
there
are
genuine
scandals
of
course
cryptography
research
has
been
chilled
the
dmca
has
been
turned
to
anticompetitive
ends
and
so
on
it
is
also
troubling
to
see
federal
judges
issuing
injunctions
not
only
against
banned
material
but
also
against
those
who
link
to
the
banned
material
somehow
the
blithe
reassurance
that
this
is
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
fails
to
comfort
one
but
many
of
the
evils
prophesied
for
the
dmca
remain
as
just
that
prophecies
there
are
also
entries
on
the
positive
side
of
the
ledger
the
that
the
dmca
gave
internet
service
providers
and
search
services
have
been
a
vital
and
positive
force
in
the
development
of
the
internet
it
may
even
be
true
that
in
some
cases
such
as
itunes
the
dmca
did
what
its
backers
claimed
it
would
encourage
new
provision
of
digital
content
by
reassuring
the
record
companies
that
they
could
put
their
music
online
surrounded
by
legally
backed
digital
rights
management
notably
however
the
trend
is
now
going
the
other
way
companies
are
coming
to
realize
that
many
consumers
prefer
and
will
pay
more
for
unprotected
files
of
course
depending
on
your
view
of
the
music
industry
that
might
seem
like
a
mixed
blessing
one
might
also
wonder
if
the
same
consumer
benefits
might
have
been
produced
with
a
much
less
restrictive
law
but
with
the
exception
of
a
few
important
areas
such
as
cryptography
research
where
its
effects
are
reported
to
be
severe
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
criticisms
focus
too
much
on
the
dmca
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
the
intellectual
property
landscape
yes
the
dmca
offers
enormous
potential
for
abuse
particularly
in
conjunction
with
some
other
developments
in
intellectual
property
that
i
will
discuss
later
but
much
of
the
abuse
has
not
yet
happened
yet
even
if
it
never
did
happen
the
dmca
has
important
lessons
to
teach
us
in
this
section
i
have
tried
to
show
how
legal
rules
particularly
intellectual
property
rules
define
the
boundaries
of
legitimate
competition
we
used
to
assume
that
this
was
principally
the
function
of
patent
and
trademark
law
less
so
of
copyright
of
course
copyright
would
affect
competition
in
publishing
and
in
the
tv
and
movie
industries
but
it
hardly
seemed
central
to
competition
policy
in
general
but
once
courts
and
legislatures
accepted
that
software
is
copyrightable
that
assessment
changed
the
levers
and
cogs
of
the
machines
of
the
modern
economy
are
forged
out
of
ones
and
zeros
instead
of
steel
and
brass
in
that
situation
copyright
is
central
to
the
competition
policy
of
a
economy
as
the
apple
case
shows
our
moral
intuitions
about
competition
are
going
to
be
cloudier
in
the
world
of
digital
content
and
cyberspace
the
same
is
true
of
the
law
even
in
the
material
world
it
can
be
hard
to
draw
the
line
between
the
legitimate
and
ruthless
pursuit
of
commercial
advantage
and
various
forms
of
unfair
competition
antitrust
violations
and
so
on
but
in
the
immaterial
world
the
boundaries
are
even
harder
to
draw
is
this
the
digital
equivalent
of
trespass
or
legitimate
passage
on
a
public
road
that
runs
through
your
property
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
the
constant
analogies
to
physical
property
are
likely
to
conceal
as
much
as
they
reveal
is
this
virtuous
competitive
imitation
or
illicit
copying
we
have
strong
and
by
no
means
coherent
moral
and
legal
intuitions
about
the
answers
to
such
questions
and
our
legal
structure
often
gives
us
the
raw
material
to
make
a
very
good
case
for
both
sides
of
the
argument
into
this
already
troubled
situation
with
a
set
of
rules
designed
for
original
expression
in
novels
and
poems
being
applied
to
machines
made
of
computer
code
we
add
the
dmca
and
its
new
rights
of
uncertain
extent
copyright
had
a
developed
set
of
exceptions
to
deal
with
anticompetitive
behavior
where
the
existing
exceptions
did
not
function
courts
tended
to
turn
to
fair
use
as
the
universal
method
for
patching
the
system
up
the
duct
tape
of
the
copyright
system
without
an
evolving
idea
of
fair
use
copyright
would
overshoot
its
bounds
as
it
was
applied
to
new
technologies
and
new
economic
conditions
indeed
that
was
the
point
of
the
sony
axiom
the
dmca
threw
this
system
into
disarray
into
a
war
of
competing
metaphors
the
skylink
court
sees
monopolists
being
handed
carte
blanche
to
abolish
the
restraints
on
their
monopolies
competition
policy
demands
that
we
construe
the
dmca
narrowly
the
reimerdes
court
sees
a
virus
masquerading
as
speech
a
digital
pandemic
that
must
be
stopped
at
all
costs
by
a
draconian
program
of
electronic
public
health
each
proceeds
to
construe
the
statute
around
the
reality
they
have
created
it
is
by
no
means
certain
which
metaphor
will
win
the
day
still
less
which
resolution
will
triumph
in
other
countries
that
have
passed
versions
of
the
dmca
international
attitudes
toward
speech
competition
and
the
necessary
exceptions
in
a
copyright
system
vary
widely
yet
backed
by
the
story
of
the
internet
threat
the
content
companies
are
already
saying
that
we
need
to
go
further
both
nationally
and
internationally
introducing
more
technology
mandates
requiring
computers
to
have
hardware
that
will
only
play
approved
copyrighted
versions
allowing
content
companies
to
hack
into
private
computers
in
search
of
material
they
think
is
theirs
and
so
on
remember
the
suggestion
from
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
that
all
cars
be
assumed
to
be
getaway
vehicles
for
the
felonious
filchers
of
vegetables
and
thus
that
they
should
be
fitted
with
radio
beacons
have
the
size
of
their
cargo
space
reduced
and
so
on
the
farmers
tale
continues
to
evolve
chapter
i
got
a
mashup
so
far
i
have
talked
about
the
root
ideas
of
intellectual
property
i
have
talked
about
its
history
about
the
way
it
influences
and
is
influenced
by
technology
i
have
talked
about
its
effects
on
free
speech
and
on
competition
until
now
however
i
have
not
described
the
way
that
it
actually
affects
culture
this
chapter
aims
to
rectify
the
omission
looking
at
the
way
copyright
law
handles
one
specific
form
of
cultural
creation
music
it
turns
out
that
some
of
the
problems
identified
in
chapters
and
are
not
simply
the
result
of
a
mismatch
between
old
law
and
new
technology
or
the
difficulties
posed
in
applying
copyright
to
software
to
machines
made
of
words
the
same
issues
appear
at
the
heart
of
a
much
older
cultural
tradition
this
is
the
story
of
a
song
and
of
that
song
history
but
it
is
also
a
story
about
property
and
race
and
art
about
the
way
copyright
law
has
shaped
encouraged
and
prohibited
music
over
the
last
hundred
years
about
the
lines
it
draws
the
boundaries
it
sets
and
the
art
it
forbids
music
is
hard
for
copyright
law
to
handle
if
one
had
to
represent
the
image
of
creativity
around
which
copyright
law
and
patent
law
respectively
are
built
patent
law
model
of
creativity
would
be
a
pyramid
and
copyright
law
a
fountain
or
even
an
explosion
in
patent
law
the
assumption
is
that
technological
development
converges
two
engineers
from
two
different
countries
tend
to
produce
similar
ways
of
catching
mice
or
harnessing
the
power
of
steam
there
are
a
limited
number
of
good
ways
of
accomplishing
a
technical
task
in
addition
technological
progress
is
assumed
to
be
incremental
each
development
builds
on
the
ones
behind
it
based
on
this
image
patent
law
makes
a
series
of
decisions
about
what
gets
covered
by
property
rights
for
how
long
how
to
handle
subsequent
improvements
and
so
on
patent
rights
last
for
a
short
time
not
only
to
lower
costs
to
consumers
but
because
we
want
to
build
on
the
technology
inventors
have
created
as
soon
as
possible
without
getting
their
permission
even
during
the
patent
term
subsequent
improvers
get
their
own
rights
and
can
bargain
with
the
original
patent
holder
to
share
the
profits
copyright
assumptions
are
different
copyright
began
with
texts
with
creative
expression
here
the
assumption
is
generally
that
there
are
infinite
possibilities
that
two
writers
will
not
converge
on
the
same
words
and
that
the
next
generation
of
storytellers
does
not
need
to
take
the
actual
stuff
that
copyright
covers
in
order
to
make
the
next
play
or
novel
it
may
be
because
of
this
image
that
so
few
policy
makers
seem
to
worry
that
copyright
now
lasts
for
a
very
long
time
subsequent
improvements
of
copyrighted
material
are
called
derivative
works
and
without
the
rights
permission
they
are
illegal
again
the
assumption
seems
to
be
that
you
can
just
write
your
own
book
do
not
claim
you
need
to
build
on
mine
of
course
each
of
these
pictures
is
a
caricature
the
reality
is
more
complex
copyright
can
make
this
assumption
more
easily
because
it
does
not
cover
ideas
or
facts
just
their
expression
boy
meets
girl
falls
in
love
girl
dies
is
not
supposed
to
be
owned
the
novel
love
story
is
it
is
assumed
that
i
do
not
need
erich
segal
copyrighted
expression
to
write
my
own
love
story
even
if
literary
creativity
does
converge
around
standard
genres
plots
and
archetypes
it
is
assumed
that
those
are
in
the
public
domain
leaving
future
creators
free
to
build
their
own
work
without
using
material
that
is
subject
to
copyright
we
could
debate
the
truth
of
that
matter
for
literature
the
expansion
of
copyright
ambit
to
cover
plotlines
and
characters
makes
it
more
questionable
certainly
many
recognized
forms
of
creativity
such
as
the
pastiche
the
collage
the
literary
biography
and
the
parody
need
extensive
access
to
prior
copyrighted
work
but
regardless
of
how
well
we
think
the
image
of
individual
creativity
fits
literature
it
fits
very
poorly
in
music
where
so
much
creativity
is
recognizably
more
collective
and
additive
and
where
much
of
the
raw
material
used
by
subsequent
creators
is
potentially
covered
by
copyright
so
how
does
the
accretive
process
of
musical
creativity
fare
in
the
modern
law
and
culture
of
copyright
how
would
the
great
musical
traditions
of
the
twentieth
century
jazz
soul
blues
rock
have
developed
under
today
copyright
regime
would
they
have
developed
at
all
how
does
the
law
apply
to
the
new
musicians
remixers
and
samplers
who
offer
their
work
on
the
internet
do
the
lines
it
draws
fit
with
our
ethics
our
traditions
of
free
speech
and
commentary
our
aesthetic
judgments
it
would
take
a
shelf
of
books
to
answer
such
questions
definitively
in
this
chapter
all
i
can
do
is
suggest
some
possibilities
using
the
history
of
a
single
song
as
my
case
study
on
august
a
hurricane
made
landfall
in
louisiana
the
forecasters
called
it
hurricane
katrina
quickly
shortened
to
katrina
as
its
story
took
over
the
news
the
new
orleans
levees
failed
soon
the
united
states
and
then
most
of
the
world
was
watching
pictures
of
a
flooded
new
orleans
seeing
pleading
citizens
mainly
and
a
keystone
cops
response
by
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
the
stories
from
new
orleans
became
more
and
more
frightening
there
were
tales
not
only
of
natural
disaster
drownings
elderly
patients
trapped
in
hospitals
but
of
a
collapse
of
civilization
looting
murder
and
rape
stores
being
broken
into
with
impunity
rescue
helicopters
fired
upon
women
and
children
sexually
assaulted
in
the
convention
center
where
many
of
the
refugees
huddled
later
it
would
turn
out
that
many
perhaps
most
of
these
reports
were
untrue
but
one
would
not
have
guessed
that
from
the
news
coverage
the
television
played
certain
images
over
and
over
again
people
again
mainly
were
portrayed
breaking
into
stores
pleading
from
rooftops
or
later
when
help
still
had
not
arrived
angrily
gesturing
and
shouting
obscenities
at
the
camera
as
the
disaster
unfolded
in
slow
motion
celebrities
began
appearing
in
televised
appeals
to
raise
money
for
those
who
had
been
affected
by
the
storm
kanye
west
the
hip
hop
musician
was
one
of
them
appearing
on
nbc
on
september
with
the
comedian
mike
myers
west
started
out
seeming
quietly
upset
finally
he
exploded
i
hate
the
way
they
portray
us
in
the
media
you
see
a
black
family
it
says
they
looting
you
see
a
white
family
it
says
they
looking
for
food
and
you
know
it
been
five
days
waiting
for
federal
help
because
most
of
the
people
are
black
so
anybody
out
there
that
wants
to
do
anything
that
we
can
help
with
the
way
america
is
set
up
to
help
the
poor
the
black
people
the
less
as
slow
as
possible
i
mean
the
red
cross
is
doing
everything
they
can
we
already
realize
a
lot
of
people
that
could
help
are
at
war
right
now
fighting
another
way
and
they
given
them
permission
to
go
down
and
shoot
us
myers
who
according
to
the
washington
post
looked
like
a
guy
who
stopped
on
the
tarmac
to
tie
his
shoe
and
got
hit
in
the
back
with
the
to
laguardia
filled
in
with
some
comments
about
the
possible
effect
of
the
storm
on
the
willingness
of
louisiana
citizens
to
live
in
the
area
in
the
future
then
he
turned
back
to
west
who
uttered
the
line
that
came
to
epitomize
katrina
for
many
people
around
the
world
and
to
infuriate
a
large
number
of
others
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
myers
the
post
wrote
now
look
ed
like
the
to
laguardia
turned
around
and
caught
him
square
between
the
eyes
in
truth
he
did
appear
even
more
stunned
than
before
something
i
would
not
have
thought
possible
in
houston
micah
nickerson
and
damien
randle
were
volunteering
to
help
new
orleans
evacuees
at
the
astrodome
and
houston
convention
center
during
the
weekend
of
september
they
too
were
incensed
both
by
the
slowness
of
the
federal
response
to
the
disaster
and
by
the
portrayal
of
the
evacuees
in
the
media
but
nickerson
and
randle
were
not
just
volunteers
they
were
also
a
duo
called
the
legendary
what
better
way
to
express
their
outrage
than
through
their
art
an
article
in
the
new
york
times
described
their
response
when
they
got
to
houston
people
were
just
seeing
for
the
first
time
how
they
were
portrayed
in
the
media
said
damien
randle
a
financial
adviser
and
one
half
of
the
legendary
it
was
so
upsetting
for
them
to
be
up
on
a
roof
for
two
days
with
their
kids
in
soiled
diapers
and
then
see
themselves
portrayed
as
looters
in
response
randle
and
his
partner
micah
nickerson
wrote
a
rap
based
on
the
stories
of
the
people
they
were
helping
on
nickerson
sent
randle
an
instant
message
containing
a
music
file
and
one
verse
recorded
on
his
home
computer
randle
recorded
an
additional
verse
and
sent
it
back
and
minutes
later
it
was
up
on
their
web
site
the
song
was
called
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
also
referred
to
as
george
bush
does
like
black
people
appropriately
given
that
west
was
the
one
to
come
up
with
the
phrase
the
song
was
built
around
west
gold
digger
much
of
the
melody
was
sampled
directly
from
the
recording
of
that
song
yet
the
words
were
very
different
where
gold
digger
is
about
a
predatory
sensual
and
materialist
woman
who
take
s
my
money
when
i
in
need
and
is
a
friend
indeed
the
legendary
song
is
a
lyrical
and
profane
condemnation
of
the
response
to
katrina
by
both
the
government
and
the
media
here
is
a
sample
five
days
in
this
attic
ca
use
the
cellphone
i
keep
getting
static
dying
they
lying
instead
of
telling
us
the
truth
other
day
the
helicopters
got
my
neighbors
off
the
roof
screwed
they
say
they
coming
back
for
us
too
that
was
three
days
ago
i
do
see
no
rescue
see
a
man
got
ta
do
what
a
man
got
ta
do
since
god
made
the
path
that
i
trying
to
walk
through
swam
to
the
store
tryin
to
look
for
food
corner
store
kinda
flooded
so
i
broke
my
way
through
i
got
what
i
could
but
before
i
got
through
news
say
the
police
shot
a
black
man
trying
to
loot
who
do
like
black
people
george
bush
do
like
black
people
george
bush
do
like
black
people
this
chapter
is
the
story
of
that
song
george
bush
care
about
black
people
is
the
end
for
the
moment
of
a
line
of
musical
borrowing
that
borrowing
extends
far
beyond
kanye
west
song
gold
digger
gold
digger
is
memorable
largely
because
it
in
turn
borrows
from
an
even
older
song
a
very
famous
one
written
half
a
century
before
and
hailed
by
many
as
the
birth
of
soul
music
it
is
in
the
origins
of
that
song
that
we
will
start
the
trail
i
got
a
woman
in
ray
charles
robinson
better
known
as
ray
charles
released
a
song
called
i
got
a
woman
it
was
a
defining
moment
in
charles
musical
development
early
in
his
career
he
had
unashamedly
modeled
himself
on
nat
king
cole
i
knew
back
then
that
nat
cole
was
bigger
than
ever
whites
could
relate
to
him
because
he
dealt
with
material
they
understood
and
he
did
so
with
great
feeling
funny
thing
but
during
all
these
years
i
was
imitating
nat
cole
i
never
thought
twice
about
it
never
felt
bad
about
copying
the
cat
licks
to
me
it
was
practically
a
science
i
worked
at
it
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
proud
of
it
and
i
loved
doing
it
he
was
a
guy
everyone
admired
and
it
just
made
sense
to
me
musical
and
commercial
sense
to
study
his
technique
it
was
something
like
when
a
young
lawyer
just
out
of
school
respects
an
older
lawyer
he
tries
to
get
inside
his
mind
he
studies
to
see
how
he
writes
up
all
his
cases
and
he
going
to
sound
a
whole
lot
like
the
older
man
at
least
till
he
figures
out
how
to
get
his
own
shit
together
today
i
hear
some
singers
who
i
think
sound
like
me
joe
cocker
for
instance
man
i
know
that
cat
must
sleep
with
my
records
but
i
do
mind
i
flattered
i
understand
after
all
i
did
the
same
in
the
early
charles
decided
that
he
needed
to
move
away
from
cole
style
and
find
his
own
sound
sink
swim
or
die
but
as
with
any
musician
his
own
sound
was
the
product
of
a
number
of
musical
traditions
blues
and
gospel
particularly
it
is
out
of
those
traditions
that
i
got
a
woman
emerged
indeed
it
is
that
combination
that
causes
it
to
be
identified
as
one
of
the
birthplaces
of
soul
music
according
to
the
overwhelming
majority
of
sources
i
got
a
woman
stems
from
a
fairly
overt
piece
of
musical
borrowing
charles
reworded
the
hymn
jesus
is
all
the
world
to
me
sometimes
referred
to
as
my
jesus
is
all
the
world
to
me
musically
soul
denotes
styles
performed
by
and
for
black
audiences
according
to
past
musical
practices
reinterpreted
and
redefined
during
its
development
three
performers
played
significant
roles
in
shaping
its
sound
messages
and
performance
practice
ray
charles
james
brown
and
aretha
franklin
if
one
can
pinpoint
a
moment
when
gospel
and
blues
began
to
merge
into
a
secular
version
of
gospel
song
it
was
in
when
ray
charles
recorded
my
jesus
is
all
the
world
to
me
changing
its
text
to
i
got
a
woman
that
story
is
repeated
in
the
biography
on
charles
web
site
charles
reworded
the
gospel
tune
is
all
the
world
to
adding
deep
church
inflections
to
the
secular
rhythms
of
the
nightclubs
and
the
world
was
never
the
same
michael
lydon
charles
most
impressive
biographer
simply
reports
that
jesus
is
all
the
world
to
me
is
described
as
the
song
origin
in
another
published
and
this
origin
is
cited
repeatedly
elsewhere
in
books
newspaper
articles
and
though
the
most
detailed
accounts
also
mention
renald
richard
trumpeter
who
is
credited
with
the
to
secular
ears
jesus
is
all
the
world
to
me
is
a
plodding
piece
of
music
with
a
mechanical
melodic
structure
it
conjures
up
a
bored
and
white
church
audience
trudging
through
the
verses
a
semitone
flat
while
thinking
about
sunday
lunch
rather
than
salvation
it
is
about
as
far
removed
as
one
could
be
from
the
syncopated
beat
and
amorous
subject
matter
of
i
got
a
woman
the
hymn
was
the
product
of
will
lamartine
thompson
a
fellow
with
a
faint
resemblance
to
an
elderly
doc
holliday
who
died
in
and
is
buried
in
the
same
place
he
was
born
east
liverpool
ohio
but
the
words
have
an
earnestness
to
them
that
gives
life
to
the
otherwise
uninspired
verse
jesus
is
all
the
world
to
me
my
life
my
joy
my
all
he
is
my
strength
from
day
to
day
without
him
i
would
fall
when
i
am
sad
to
him
i
go
no
other
one
can
cheer
me
so
when
i
am
sad
he
makes
me
glad
he
my
friend
reading
those
words
one
can
understand
the
sincerity
that
made
thompson
spurn
commercial
publishers
for
his
devotional
music
instead
founding
his
own
publishing
house
also
in
east
liverpool
to
make
sure
that
his
hymns
reached
the
people
i
can
quote
as
much
of
the
song
as
i
want
without
worrying
about
legal
consequences
because
the
copyright
on
thompson
lyrics
has
expired
so
has
the
copyright
over
the
music
the
song
was
published
in
copyright
had
only
been
extended
to
musical
compositions
in
like
all
copyrights
back
then
copyright
over
music
lasted
for
only
years
with
a
possible
extension
for
another
fourteen
if
ray
charles
did
indeed
reword
it
fifty
years
later
he
was
doing
nothing
illegal
it
had
been
in
the
public
domain
for
at
least
eight
years
and
probably
for
twenty
now
maybe
charles
genius
was
to
hear
in
this
hymn
or
in
a
syncopated
gospel
version
of
this
hymn
the
possibility
of
a
fusion
of
traditions
which
would
itself
become
a
new
tradition
soul
or
perhaps
his
genius
was
in
knowing
a
good
idea
richard
when
he
heard
it
and
turning
that
idea
into
the
beginnings
of
its
own
musical
genre
soul
is
a
fusion
of
gospel
on
the
one
hand
and
rhythm
and
blues
on
the
other
from
gospel
soul
takes
the
pattern
of
preacher
and
congregation
and
the
wailing
vocals
of
someone
testifying
to
their
faith
from
rhythm
and
blues
it
takes
the
choice
of
instruments
some
of
the
upbeat
tempo
and
the
distinctly
worldly
and
secular
attitude
to
the
inevitable
troubles
of
life
musicologists
delight
in
parsing
the
patterns
of
influence
further
r
b
itself
had
roots
in
jump
music
and
the
vocal
style
of
the
blues
shouters
who
performed
with
the
big
bands
it
also
has
links
to
jazz
gospel
reaches
back
to
spirituals
and
so
on
as
with
all
music
those
musical
traditions
can
be
traced
back
or
forward
in
time
the
net
of
influence
and
borrowing
widening
as
one
goes
in
either
direction
in
each
one
can
point
to
distinctive
musical
motifs
the
chords
of
the
blues
or
the
flattened
fifth
in
bebop
but
musical
traditions
are
also
defined
by
performance
styles
and
characteristic
sounds
the
warm
guitar
that
came
out
of
the
valve
amplifiers
of
early
funk
the
thrashing
and
poorly
miked
drums
of
punk
or
the
tinny
piano
of
finally
styles
are
often
built
around
standards
classic
songs
of
the
genre
to
which
an
almost
obligatory
reference
is
made
my
colleague
the
talented
composer
anthony
kelley
uses
henry
louis
gates
term
signifyin
to
describe
the
process
of
showing
you
are
embedded
in
your
musical
tradition
by
referring
back
to
its
classics
in
your
playing
in
jazz
for
example
one
demonstrates
one
rootedness
in
the
tradition
by
quoting
a
standard
but
also
one
virtuosity
in
being
able
to
trim
it
into
a
particular
solo
beginning
and
ending
on
the
right
note
for
the
current
moment
in
the
chord
progression
i
got
rhythm
and
round
midnight
are
such
songs
for
jazz
the
chord
changes
of
i
got
rhythm
are
so
standard
they
are
referred
to
as
the
rhythm
changes
a
standard
basis
for
improvisation
and
to
stretch
the
connections
further
as
kelley
points
out
the
haunting
introduction
to
round
midnight
is
itself
remarkably
similar
to
sibelius
fifth
symphony
through
all
these
layers
of
musical
borrowing
and
reference
at
least
in
the
twentieth
century
in
the
united
states
runs
the
seam
of
race
when
white
musicians
borrowed
from
soul
to
make
soul
when
elvis
took
songs
and
styles
from
rhythm
and
blues
and
turned
them
into
rockabilly
a
process
of
racial
cleansing
went
on
styles
were
adapted
but
were
cleansed
of
those
elements
thought
inappropriate
for
a
larger
white
audience
generally
this
involved
cutting
some
of
the
rawer
sensuality
removing
racially
specific
verbal
and
musical
references
and
for
much
of
the
century
cutting
the
american
artists
out
of
the
profits
in
the
process
there
is
another
irony
here
styles
formed
by
patterns
of
gleeful
borrowing
formed
as
part
of
a
musical
commons
the
blues
of
the
mississippi
delta
for
example
were
eventually
commercialized
and
frozen
into
a
particular
form
by
white
artists
sometimes
those
styles
were
covered
with
intellectual
property
rights
which
denied
the
ability
of
the
original
community
to
borrow
back
in
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
of
the
century
artists
got
into
the
picture
too
understandably
embracing
with
considerable
zeal
the
commercial
opportunities
and
property
rights
that
had
previously
been
denied
to
them
but
aside
from
the
issue
of
racial
injustice
one
has
to
consider
the
question
of
sustainability
in
other
work
i
have
tried
to
show
how
a
vision
of
intellectual
property
rights
built
around
a
notion
of
the
romantic
author
can
sometimes
operate
as
a
valve
traditional
and
collective
creative
there
is
a
danger
that
copyright
will
treat
collectively
created
musical
traditions
as
unowned
raw
material
but
will
then
prevent
the
commercialized
versions
of
those
traditions
now
associated
with
an
individual
artist
from
continuing
to
act
as
the
basis
for
the
next
cycle
of
musical
adaptation
and
development
one
wonders
whether
jazz
blues
r
b
gospel
and
soul
would
even
have
been
possible
as
musical
styles
if
from
their
inception
they
had
been
covered
by
the
strong
property
rights
we
apply
today
that
is
a
question
i
want
to
return
to
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
musical
styles
change
over
time
and
so
do
their
techniques
of
appropriation
sometimes
musical
generations
find
their
successors
are
engaging
in
different
types
of
borrowing
than
they
themselves
engaged
in
they
do
not
always
find
it
congenial
it
is
striking
how
often
musicians
condemn
a
younger
generation
practice
of
musical
appropriation
as
theft
while
viewing
their
own
musical
development
and
indebtedness
as
benign
and
organic
james
brown
attacked
the
use
of
his
guitar
licks
or
the
drum
patterns
from
his
songs
by
samplers
for
example
but
celebrated
the
process
of
borrowing
from
gospel
standards
and
from
rhythm
and
blues
that
created
the
hardest
working
man
in
show
business
both
the
song
and
the
musical
persona
to
be
sure
there
are
differences
between
the
two
practices
samplers
take
a
segment
off
the
actual
recording
of
funky
drummer
manipulate
it
and
turn
it
into
a
repeating
rhythm
loop
for
a
song
this
is
a
different
kind
of
borrowing
than
the
adaptation
of
a
chord
pattern
from
a
gospel
standard
to
make
an
r
b
hit
but
which
way
does
the
difference
cut
as
a
matter
of
ethics
aesthetics
or
law
charles
himself
came
in
for
considerable
criticism
for
his
fusion
of
gospel
intonations
and
melodic
structures
with
the
nightclub
sound
of
rhythm
and
blues
but
not
because
it
was
viewed
as
piracy
it
was
viewed
as
sacrilegious
charles
totally
removed
himself
from
the
polite
music
he
had
made
in
the
past
there
was
an
unrestrained
exuberance
to
the
new
ray
charles
a
fierce
earthiness
that
while
it
would
not
have
been
unfamiliar
to
any
follower
of
gospel
music
was
almost
revolutionary
in
the
world
of
pop
big
bill
broonzy
was
outraged
he
crying
sanctified
he
mixing
the
blues
with
the
spirituals
he
should
be
singing
in
a
church
charles
disagreed
you
ca
run
away
from
yourself
what
you
are
inside
is
what
you
are
inside
i
was
raised
in
the
church
and
was
around
blues
and
would
hear
all
these
musicians
on
the
jukeboxes
and
then
i
would
go
to
revival
meetings
on
sunday
morning
so
i
would
get
both
sides
of
music
a
lot
of
people
at
the
time
thought
it
was
sacrilegious
but
all
i
was
doing
was
singing
the
way
i
felt
why
the
charge
of
sacrilege
because
beyond
the
breach
of
stylistic
barriers
the
relationships
charles
described
did
not
seem
to
belong
in
church
i
got
a
woman
tells
of
a
woman
way
over
town
who
is
good
to
the
singer
very
good
in
fact
she
gives
him
money
when
he
is
in
need
is
a
kind
of
friend
indeed
even
saves
her
early
morning
loving
just
for
him
and
it
is
tender
loving
at
that
in
the
third
verse
we
learn
she
does
not
grumble
fuss
or
run
in
the
streets
knows
a
woman
place
is
right
there
now
in
the
home
and
in
general
is
a
paragon
of
femininity
gender
roles
aside
it
is
a
fabulous
song
from
the
elongated
in
charles
distinctive
tones
to
the
momentary
hesitation
that
heightens
the
tension
all
the
way
through
the
driving
beat
of
the
main
verses
and
the
sense
that
a
gospel
choir
would
have
fit
right
in
on
the
choruses
testifying
ecstatically
to
the
virtues
of
charles
lady
friend
charles
liked
women
a
lot
of
women
according
to
his
biographers
and
a
lot
of
women
liked
him
right
back
that
feeling
comes
through
very
clearly
from
this
song
i
would
like
to
quote
the
song
lyrics
for
you
just
as
i
did
the
words
of
the
hymn
but
that
requires
a
little
more
thought
charles
song
was
released
in
by
that
time
the
copyright
term
for
a
musical
composition
was
years
renewable
for
another
if
the
author
wished
later
the
second
term
would
be
increased
to
years
still
later
the
copyright
term
would
be
extended
to
life
plus
seventy
years
or
years
for
a
work
for
hire
sound
recordings
themselves
would
not
be
protected
by
federal
law
until
the
early
anyone
who
wrote
or
distributed
a
song
under
the
system
was
in
effect
saying
this
is
a
long
enough
protection
for
me
enough
incentive
to
create
thus
we
could
have
assumed
that
i
got
a
woman
would
enter
the
public
domain
in
either
or
if
renewed
unfortunately
for
us
and
for
a
ray
charles
the
copyright
term
has
been
extended
several
times
since
then
and
each
time
it
was
also
extended
retrospectively
artists
musicians
novelists
and
filmmakers
who
had
created
their
works
on
the
understanding
that
they
had
or
or
years
of
protection
now
have
considerably
more
this
was
the
point
raised
in
chapter
most
of
the
culture
of
the
twentieth
century
produced
under
a
perfectly
system
with
much
shorter
copyright
terms
is
still
locked
up
and
will
be
for
many
years
to
come
in
the
case
of
i
got
a
woman
it
is
now
about
fifty
years
since
the
song
release
the
same
length
of
time
as
between
thompson
hymn
and
charles
alleged
rewording
if
the
words
and
music
were
properly
copyrighted
at
the
time
of
its
publication
and
renewed
when
appropriate
the
copyright
still
has
years
to
run
no
one
will
be
able
to
reword
i
got
a
woman
and
use
it
to
found
a
new
genre
or
take
substantial
portions
of
its
melody
until
the
year
the
freedoms
ray
charles
says
he
used
to
create
his
song
are
denied
to
his
successors
until
nearly
a
century
after
the
release
as
we
will
see
in
a
moment
this
put
certain
constraints
on
kanye
west
would
it
truly
be
a
violation
of
copyright
for
me
to
quote
the
middle
stanza
in
a
nonfiction
book
on
copyright
policy
not
at
all
it
is
a
classic
fair
use
in
a
moment
i
will
do
so
but
it
is
something
that
the
publisher
may
well
fuss
over
because
copyright
holders
are
extremely
aggressive
in
asking
for
payments
for
the
slightest
little
segment
copyright
holders
in
music
and
song
lyrics
are
among
the
most
aggressive
of
the
lot
year
after
year
academics
critics
and
historians
pay
fairly
substantial
fees
by
our
standards
to
license
tiny
fragments
of
songs
even
though
their
incorporation
is
almost
certainly
fair
use
many
of
them
do
not
know
the
law
others
do
but
want
to
avoid
the
hassle
the
threats
the
nasty
letters
it
is
simpler
just
to
pay
unfortunately
these
individual
actions
have
a
collective
impact
one
of
the
factors
used
to
consider
whether
something
is
a
fair
use
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
market
for
this
particular
use
of
a
work
if
there
is
it
is
less
likely
to
be
a
fair
use
to
quote
or
incorporate
such
a
fragment
as
several
courts
have
pointed
out
there
is
a
powerful
element
of
circularity
here
you
claim
you
have
a
right
to
stop
me
from
doing
x
quoting
two
lines
of
your
song
in
an
academic
book
say
i
say
you
have
no
such
right
and
it
is
a
fair
use
you
say
it
is
not
a
fair
use
because
it
interferes
with
your
market
the
market
for
selling
licenses
for
sentence
fragments
but
when
do
you
have
such
a
market
when
you
have
a
right
to
stop
me
quoting
the
fragment
unless
i
pay
you
do
you
have
such
a
right
but
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
trying
to
decide
is
it
a
fair
use
or
not
the
existence
of
the
market
depends
on
it
not
being
a
fair
use
for
me
to
quote
it
without
permission
to
say
i
would
have
a
market
if
i
could
stop
you
doing
it
so
it
can
not
be
a
fair
use
so
i
can
stop
you
is
perfectly
circular
how
do
we
get
out
of
the
circle
often
the
court
will
look
to
customs
and
patterns
in
the
world
outside
do
people
accept
this
as
a
market
do
they
traditionally
pay
such
fees
thus
if
a
lot
of
people
choose
to
pay
for
quotes
that
actually
should
have
been
fair
use
the
market
for
short
quotes
will
begin
to
emerge
that
will
in
turn
affect
the
boundaries
of
fair
use
for
the
worse
slowly
fair
use
will
constrict
will
atrophy
the
hypertrophied
permissions
culture
starts
as
myth
but
it
can
become
reality
in
any
event
ray
charles
had
no
need
of
fair
use
to
make
i
got
a
woman
because
the
hymn
his
biography
claims
it
is
based
on
was
in
the
public
domain
but
is
that
the
real
source
i
can
hear
little
resemblance
as
i
researched
the
origins
of
i
got
a
woman
i
found
claims
that
there
was
a
different
source
a
mysterious
song
by
the
bailey
gospel
singers
or
the
harold
bailey
gospel
singers
called
i
got
a
savior
the
columbia
records
gospel
catalogue
even
provided
a
catalogue
there
was
such
a
song
or
so
it
seemed
but
there
the
research
stalled
the
exemplary
librarians
at
duke
university
music
library
could
find
no
trace
catalogues
of
published
records
showed
nothing
inquiries
to
various
music
librarian
listservs
also
produced
no
answer
there
was
a
man
called
harold
bailey
who
sang
with
a
group
of
gospel
singers
but
though
several
internet
postings
suggested
he
was
connected
to
the
song
his
biography
revealed
he
would
have
been
only
thirteen
at
the
time
the
library
of
congress
did
not
have
it
eventually
jordi
weinstock
a
great
research
assistant
who
demonstrated
willingness
to
pester
anyone
in
the
world
who
might
conceivably
have
access
to
the
recording
hit
gold
the
rodgers
and
hammerstein
archives
of
recorded
sound
at
the
new
york
public
library
for
the
performing
arts
had
a
copy
a
rpm
vinyl
record
by
the
bailey
gospel
singers
with
jesus
is
the
searchlight
on
the
our
library
was
able
to
obtain
a
copy
on
interlibrary
loan
from
the
helpful
curator
don
mccormick
it
sounds
like
the
same
song
not
the
same
words
of
course
the
introduction
is
different
and
the
bailey
gospel
singers
lack
the
backing
of
charles
version
but
the
central
melody
is
almost
exactly
the
same
when
the
bailey
gospel
singers
sing
keeps
me
up
keeps
me
strong
teach
me
right
when
i
doing
wrong
well
i
got
a
savior
oh
what
a
savior
yes
i
have
the
melody
and
even
the
intonation
parallel
charles
singing
the
equivalent
lines
she
gim
me
money
when
i
in
need
yeah
she
a
kind
of
friend
indeed
i
got
a
woman
way
over
town
who
good
to
me
true
some
of
the
lyrical
and
rhythmic
patterns
of
i
got
a
savior
are
older
still
they
come
from
a
spiritual
called
ai
that
good
news
dating
from
which
rehearses
all
the
things
the
singer
will
have
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
a
harp
a
robe
slippers
and
finally
a
savior
the
author
of
i
got
a
savior
was
like
all
the
artists
discussed
here
taking
a
great
deal
from
a
prior
musical
tradition
nevertheless
charles
borrowing
is
particularly
overt
and
direct
the
term
rewording
is
appropriate
so
far
as
i
can
see
whether
or
not
he
also
relied
on
a
hymn
ray
charles
appears
to
have
taken
both
the
melody
and
lyrical
pattern
of
his
most
famous
hit
from
a
song
that
was
made
a
mere
three
or
four
years
earlier
like
many
rpm
records
this
one
was
sold
without
liner
notes
the
center
of
the
record
provides
the
only
details
it
gives
the
name
of
the
track
and
the
band
and
a
single
word
under
the
song
title
ward
presumably
the
composer
ward
might
be
clara
ward
of
the
ward
singers
a
talented
gospel
singer
and
songwriter
who
became
aretha
franklin
mentor
and
who
had
her
own
music
publishing
company
there
is
a
particular
reason
to
think
that
she
might
have
written
the
song
ray
charles
clearly
liked
to
adapt
her
music
to
secular
ends
we
know
that
he
reworked
ward
gospel
classic
this
little
light
of
mine
into
this
little
girl
of
mine
ward
reportedly
was
irritated
by
the
practice
so
far
as
we
know
the
copying
of
the
music
did
not
annoy
her
because
she
viewed
it
as
theft
but
because
she
viewed
it
as
an
offense
against
gospel
music
charles
is
now
starting
to
get
criticism
from
some
gospel
music
performers
for
secularizing
gospel
music
and
presenting
it
in
usual
r
b
venues
most
adamant
in
her
misgivings
is
clara
ward
who
complains
about
this
little
girl
of
mine
being
a
reworking
of
this
little
light
of
mine
which
it
is
as
a
slap
against
the
gospel
this
stage
of
charles
career
is
described
rightly
as
the
moment
when
his
originality
bursts
forth
where
he
stops
imitating
the
smooth
sounds
of
nat
king
cole
and
instead
produces
the
earthy
and
sensual
style
that
becomes
his
trademark
his
own
sound
that
is
true
enough
there
had
been
nothing
quite
like
this
before
yet
it
was
hardly
original
creation
out
of
nothing
both
charles
himself
and
the
musicological
literature
point
out
that
his
own
sound
his
style
is
in
reality
a
fusion
of
two
prior
genres
rhythm
and
blues
and
gospel
but
looking
at
the
actual
songs
that
created
soul
as
a
genre
shows
us
that
the
fusion
goes
far
beyond
merely
a
stylistic
one
charles
makes
some
of
his
most
famous
songs
by
taking
existing
gospel
classics
and
reworking
or
simply
rewording
them
i
got
a
savior
becomes
i
got
a
woman
this
little
light
of
mine
becomes
this
little
girl
of
mine
the
connection
is
striking
two
very
recent
gospel
songs
probably
by
the
same
author
from
which
charles
copies
the
melody
structure
pattern
of
verses
even
most
of
the
title
in
each
case
substituting
a
beloved
sensual
woman
for
the
beloved
deity
many
others
have
noticed
just
how
closely
charles
based
his
songs
on
gospel
tunes
although
the
prevalence
of
the
story
that
i
got
a
woman
is
derived
from
an
hymn
caused
most
to
see
only
the
second
transposition
not
the
borrowing
from
a
hymn
and
changing
it
substantially
in
the
process
seems
a
little
different
from
the
repeated
process
of
search
and
replace
musical
collage
that
charles
performed
on
the
contemporary
works
of
clara
ward
if
i
am
right
charles
merger
of
gospel
and
blues
relied
on
a
very
direct
process
of
transposition
the
transposition
was
not
just
of
themes
passion
for
woman
substituted
for
passion
for
god
that
is
a
familiar
aspect
of
it
is
what
allows
it
to
draw
so
easily
from
gospel
fieriness
and
yet
coat
the
religion
with
a
distinctly
more
worldly
passion
sex
sin
and
syncopation
what
more
could
one
ask
but
charles
genius
was
to
take
particular
songs
that
had
already
proved
themselves
in
the
church
and
on
the
radio
and
to
grab
large
chunks
of
the
melody
and
structure
he
was
not
just
copying
themes
or
merging
genres
he
was
copying
the
melodies
and
words
from
recent
songs
was
this
mere
musical
plagiarism
then
should
we
think
less
of
ray
charles
genius
because
we
find
just
how
closely
two
of
the
canonical
songs
in
the
creation
of
soul
were
based
on
the
work
of
his
contemporaries
hardly
i
got
a
woman
and
this
little
girl
of
mine
are
simply
brilliant
charles
does
in
fact
span
the
worlds
of
the
nightclub
at
on
sunday
morning
and
the
church
later
that
day
of
ecstatic
testimony
and
good
fashioned
sexual
infatuation
but
the
way
he
does
so
is
a
lot
more
like
welding
or
bricolage
than
it
is
like
designing
out
of
nothing
or
creating
anew
while
distantly
tugged
by
mysterious
musical
forces
called
themes
or
genres
charles
takes
bits
that
have
been
proven
to
work
and
combines
them
to
make
something
new
when
i
tell
engineers
or
software
engineers
this
story
they
nod
of
course
that
is
how
creation
works
one
does
not
reinvent
the
wheel
or
the
method
of
debugging
so
why
should
one
reinvent
the
hook
the
riff
or
the
melody
and
yet
charles
creation
does
not
have
the
degraded
artistic
quality
that
is
associated
with
mere
or
collage
techniques
the
combination
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
if
charles
songs
do
not
fit
our
model
of
innovative
artistic
creativity
perhaps
we
need
to
revise
the
model
at
least
for
music
rather
than
devaluing
his
work
when
i
began
this
study
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
greatest
challenge
to
copyright
law
in
dealing
with
music
was
preventing
rights
from
creeping
expanding
from
coverage
of
a
single
song
or
melody
to
cover
essential
elements
of
genre
style
and
theme
in
effect
we
needed
to
apply
the
jefferson
warning
to
music
to
defeat
the
constant
tendency
to
confuse
intellectual
property
with
real
property
and
to
reject
the
attempts
to
make
the
right
holder
control
total
my
assumption
was
that
all
we
needed
to
do
was
to
keep
open
the
common
space
of
genre
and
style
and
let
new
artists
create
their
new
compositions
out
of
the
material
in
that
commons
and
gain
protection
over
them
in
many
ways
charles
work
lies
at
the
very
core
of
the
stuff
copyright
wishes
to
promote
it
is
not
merely
innovative
and
expressive
itself
it
also
helped
form
a
whole
new
genre
in
which
other
artists
could
express
themselves
but
to
create
this
work
charles
needed
to
make
use
of
a
lot
more
than
just
genres
and
styles
created
by
others
he
needed
their
actual
songs
if
the
reactions
of
clara
ward
and
big
bill
broonzy
are
anything
to
go
by
they
would
not
have
given
him
permission
to
them
soul
was
a
stylistic
violation
a
mingling
of
the
sacred
with
the
profane
if
given
a
copyright
veto
over
his
work
and
a
culture
that
accepts
its
use
ward
might
well
have
exercised
it
like
the
disapproving
heirs
that
macaulay
talked
about
she
could
have
denied
us
a
vital
part
of
the
cultural
record
control
has
a
price
did
ray
charles
commit
copyright
infringement
perhaps
we
would
have
to
find
if
the
songs
are
substantially
similar
once
we
had
excluded
standard
forms
public
domain
elements
and
so
on
i
would
say
that
they
are
substantially
similar
but
was
the
material
used
expression
the
copyright
office
database
shows
no
entry
for
i
got
a
savior
this
is
not
conclusive
but
it
seems
to
indicate
that
no
copyright
was
ever
registered
in
the
work
in
fact
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
song
was
first
written
without
a
copyright
notice
nowadays
that
omission
would
be
irrelevant
works
are
copyrighted
as
soon
as
they
are
fixed
in
material
form
regardless
of
whether
any
copyright
notice
is
attached
in
however
a
notice
was
required
when
the
work
was
published
and
if
one
was
not
put
on
the
work
it
passed
immediately
into
the
public
domain
however
later
legislation
decreed
that
the
relevant
publication
was
not
of
the
record
but
of
the
notation
if
the
record
were
pressed
and
sold
without
a
copyright
notice
the
error
could
be
corrected
if
a
lead
sheet
or
a
sheet
music
version
of
i
got
a
savior
had
been
published
without
notice
or
registration
it
would
enter
the
public
domain
it
is
possible
that
this
happened
intellectual
property
rights
simply
played
a
lesser
role
in
the
music
business
than
they
do
today
both
for
better
and
for
worse
large
areas
of
creativity
operated
as
zones
even
where
copyrights
were
properly
registered
permission
fees
were
not
demanded
for
tiny
samples
while
bootlegged
recordings
or
direct
copies
might
well
draw
legal
action
borrowing
and
transformation
were
apparently
viewed
as
a
normal
part
of
the
creative
process
in
some
cases
artists
simply
did
not
use
copyright
they
made
money
from
performances
their
records
might
receive
some
kind
of
protection
from
state
law
these
protections
sufficed
but
the
lack
of
protection
also
had
a
less
attractive
and
more
racially
skewed
side
artists
were
less
likely
to
have
the
resources
and
knowledge
necessary
to
navigate
the
system
of
copyright
for
both
black
and
white
artists
whatever
rights
there
were
moved
quickly
away
from
the
actual
creators
toward
the
agents
record
companies
and
distributors
they
still
do
but
musicians
got
an
even
worse
deal
than
their
white
counterparts
true
the
copyright
system
was
only
an
infinitesimal
part
of
that
process
a
much
larger
part
was
the
economic
consequences
of
segregation
and
racial
apartheid
but
copyright
was
one
of
the
many
levers
of
power
that
were
more
easily
pulled
by
white
hands
this
is
an
important
point
because
the
need
to
end
that
palpable
racial
injustice
is
sometimes
used
to
justify
every
aspect
of
our
current
highly
legalized
musical
culture
about
that
conclusion
i
am
less
convinced
in
any
event
it
is
possible
that
the
musical
composition
for
i
got
a
savior
went
immediately
into
the
public
domain
if
that
were
the
case
ray
charles
could
draw
on
it
could
change
it
could
refine
it
without
permission
or
fee
certainly
there
is
no
mention
of
seeking
permission
or
paying
fees
in
any
of
the
histories
of
i
got
a
woman
indeed
the
only
question
of
rectitude
charles
was
focused
on
was
the
stylistic
one
was
it
appropriate
to
mix
gospel
and
r
b
devotional
music
and
secular
desire
charles
and
richard
seemed
to
see
the
process
of
rewording
and
adapting
as
just
a
standard
part
of
the
creative
process
the
only
question
was
whether
these
two
styles
were
aesthetically
or
morally
suited
not
whether
the
borrowing
itself
was
illegal
or
unethical
so
whether
they
drew
on
a
hymn
that
had
fallen
into
the
public
domain
after
the
expiration
of
its
copyright
term
or
a
gospel
song
for
which
copyright
had
never
been
sought
or
whether
they
simply
took
a
copyrighted
song
and
did
to
it
something
that
no
one
at
the
time
thought
was
legally
inappropriate
renald
richard
and
ray
charles
were
able
to
create
i
got
a
woman
and
play
a
significant
role
in
founding
a
new
musical
genre
soul
one
thing
is
clear
much
of
what
charles
and
richard
did
in
creating
their
song
would
be
illegal
today
copyright
terms
are
longer
copyright
protection
itself
is
automatic
copyright
policing
is
much
more
aggressive
the
musical
culture
has
changed
into
one
in
which
every
fragment
must
be
licensed
and
paid
for
the
combination
is
fatal
to
the
particular
pattern
of
borrowing
that
created
these
seminal
songs
of
soul
that
should
give
us
pause
i
return
to
the
ideas
of
the
jefferson
warning
from
chapter
and
the
sony
axiom
from
chapter
copyright
is
not
an
end
in
itself
it
has
a
goal
to
promote
the
progress
of
cultural
and
scientific
creativity
that
goal
requires
rights
that
are
less
than
absolute
as
jessica
litman
points
out
building
in
the
intellectual
space
is
different
from
building
in
the
physical
space
we
do
not
normally
dismantle
old
houses
to
make
new
ones
this
point
is
not
confined
to
music
earlier
i
quoted
northrop
frye
poetry
can
only
be
made
out
of
other
poems
novels
out
of
other
novels
all
of
this
was
much
clearer
before
the
assimilation
of
literature
to
private
enterprise
the
question
is
how
big
are
the
holes
we
need
to
leave
in
the
private
rights
how
large
a
commons
do
we
need
to
offer
to
future
creators
ray
charles
creation
of
i
got
a
woman
is
only
one
case
by
itself
it
proves
nothing
yet
if
we
find
that
the
seminal
artworks
of
yesteryear
would
be
illegal
under
the
law
and
culture
of
today
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
is
this
really
what
we
want
what
will
the
music
of
the
future
look
like
if
the
clara
wards
and
will
lamartine
thompsons
of
today
can
simply
refuse
to
license
on
aesthetic
grounds
or
demand
payment
for
every
tiny
fragment
tracing
the
line
further
back
it
is
fascinating
to
wonder
whether
gospel
blues
and
jazz
would
have
developed
if
musical
motifs
had
been
jealously
guarded
as
private
property
rather
than
developed
as
a
kind
of
melodic
and
rhythmic
commons
like
most
counterfactuals
that
one
has
no
clear
answer
but
there
is
substantial
cause
for
skepticism
if
copyright
is
supposed
to
be
promoting
innovation
and
development
in
culture
is
it
doing
its
job
an
industry
of
gold
diggers
fifty
years
after
i
got
a
woman
was
written
kanye
west
released
gold
digger
on
the
album
late
registration
west
is
an
interesting
figure
in
rap
at
first
he
was
shunned
because
his
looks
and
preppy
clothing
ran
against
the
gangster
image
that
often
dominates
the
music
it
is
just
hard
imagining
west
delivering
a
line
like
rakim
i
used
to
be
a
kid
so
i
think
of
all
the
devious
things
i
did
with
a
straight
face
still
less
stop
smiling
ai
nothin
funny
nothing
moves
but
the
money
perhaps
partly
as
a
result
his
lyrics
are
oddly
bipolar
in
their
views
about
exaggerated
masculinity
and
the
misogyny
that
sometimes
accompanies
it
for
the
song
west
recruited
jamie
foxx
who
had
played
ray
charles
in
the
movie
ray
showing
an
impressive
expanse
of
oiled
chest
foxx
imitates
charles
style
and
the
melody
of
i
got
a
woman
to
provide
the
lyrical
chorus
to
gold
digger
i
got
a
woman
anchors
west
song
it
provides
its
melodic
hook
it
breaks
up
the
rap
with
a
burst
of
musical
nostalgia
but
west
gold
digger
is
very
different
from
ray
charles
woman
friend
this
woman
does
not
give
money
when
the
singer
is
in
need
she
takes
his
money
when
he
is
in
need
and
is
a
friend
indeed
charles
had
a
friend
who
gave
him
tender
morning
loving
jamie
foxx
sings
of
a
mercenary
gold
digger
who
digs
on
him
when
west
adds
the
rap
verses
to
the
song
we
get
a
perfect
caricature
of
such
a
person
uninterested
in
any
man
who
is
broke
dragging
around
four
kids
and
an
entourage
insisting
all
of
them
be
entertained
at
her
boyfriend
expense
and
wielding
unfounded
paternity
suits
like
a
proprietary
business
method
west
repeated
disclaimer
i
ai
she
a
gold
digger
is
unconvincing
because
both
the
words
of
the
introduction
and
the
implicit
message
of
the
rap
tell
us
she
is
we
even
get
the
absurd
image
of
a
man
who
is
playing
on
the
winning
side
in
the
super
bowl
but
driving
a
hyundai
so
financially
demanding
is
his
girlfriend
at
several
points
the
song
descends
into
ludicrous
and
perhaps
conscious
as
it
explores
the
concerns
of
the
rich
celebrity
male
my
favorite
line
is
if
you
ai
no
punk
holler
want
prenup
the
audience
obliges
it
sounds
like
assertiveness
training
for
show
business
millionaires
it
would
be
hard
to
get
a
feminist
role
model
out
of
either
i
got
a
woman
or
gold
digger
one
offers
the
feminine
virtues
of
modesty
and
fidelity
but
magically
combines
them
with
wantonness
where
the
singer
is
concerned
and
an
open
checkbook
the
other
is
a
parody
of
the
economic
actor
as
rapacious
as
any
multinational
who
uses
her
sexuality
for
profit
put
them
together
and
you
have
bookends
male
fantasy
and
male
nightmare
was
that
west
point
perhaps
the
song
itself
takes
several
sly
turns
the
gold
digger
dogging
west
is
used
as
part
of
a
homily
to
black
women
on
how
to
treat
their
noncelebrity
black
men
they
should
stick
with
their
man
because
his
ambition
is
going
to
take
him
from
mopping
floors
to
the
fryers
from
a
datsun
to
a
benz
it
seems
that
west
is
getting
a
little
preachy
while
slamming
the
actual
social
mobility
available
to
black
men
moving
from
floor
cleaning
to
frying
chicken
is
not
actually
going
to
provide
a
mercedes
but
he
immediately
undercuts
that
tone
twice
once
by
acknowledging
the
boyfriend
likely
infidelity
and
again
by
saying
that
even
if
the
black
woman
follows
his
homily
once
you
get
on
he
leave
yo
ass
for
a
white
girl
west
has
a
tendency
to
make
sudden
turns
like
this
in
his
lyrics
ironically
upsetting
the
theme
he
has
just
set
up
so
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
that
he
deliberately
used
a
fragment
of
charles
song
not
just
because
it
sounded
good
but
to
contrast
the
image
of
the
fantasy
woman
from
charles
soul
who
is
faithful
sensual
and
always
willing
to
offer
a
loan
with
an
image
from
today
rap
sexually
predatory
and
emasculating
women
who
are
uninterested
in
men
except
as
a
source
of
money
even
the
retro
cover
of
the
single
with
its
pinup
drawing
of
a
white
model
seems
to
draw
the
connection
did
he
use
charles
song
precisely
because
of
these
clashing
cultural
snapshots
perhaps
or
perhaps
he
just
liked
the
tune
in
any
event
the
contrast
is
striking
when
it
was
released
song
was
seen
as
a
sacrilegious
depiction
of
sensuality
and
the
woman
was
decried
as
a
harlot
compared
to
the
woman
in
west
song
she
sounds
like
a
girl
scout
it
is
also
a
little
depressing
ray
charles
was
neither
an
egalitarian
metrosexual
nor
a
prince
charming
where
women
were
concerned
anything
but
but
as
i
said
before
you
do
get
a
sense
that
he
liked
women
however
unrealistic
or
their
portrayal
it
is
hard
to
get
that
sense
from
gold
digger
was
west
legally
required
to
ask
permission
and
pay
if
necessary
to
use
a
fragment
of
i
got
a
woman
for
his
chorus
the
longest
single
piece
of
borrowing
occurs
in
the
introduction
words
and
their
accompanying
music
she
takes
my
money
when
i
in
need
oh
she
a
friend
indeed
oh
she
a
gold
digger
way
over
town
who
digs
on
me
as
i
pointed
out
the
lyrics
from
charles
song
present
a
very
different
story
she
gim
me
money
when
i
in
need
yeah
she
a
kind
of
friend
indeed
i
got
a
woman
way
over
town
who
good
to
me
but
even
if
the
message
is
the
opposite
the
musical
borrowing
is
direct
it
is
also
extensive
during
west
rap
the
entire
background
melody
is
a
loop
of
jamie
foxx
singing
the
ray
melody
in
the
background
during
the
song
foxx
returns
to
words
that
are
closer
to
charles
original
she
gim
me
money
when
i
in
need
a
refrain
that
is
conspicuously
at
odds
with
the
woman
being
described
by
west
that
loop
of
a
ray
charles
melody
runs
throughout
kanye
west
song
west
is
very
successful
so
the
fragment
of
the
song
was
cleared
payment
was
made
to
charles
estate
it
is
fascinating
to
think
of
what
might
have
happened
if
heirs
had
refused
after
all
one
could
see
west
song
as
a
crude
desecration
of
charles
earlier
work
rather
than
a
humored
homage
since
this
is
not
a
cover
version
of
the
song
one
which
does
not
change
its
nature
and
thus
operates
under
the
statutory
licensing
scheme
charles
heirs
would
have
the
right
to
refuse
a
licensing
request
unlike
clara
ward
it
is
clear
that
charles
heirs
have
the
legal
power
to
say
no
to
prevent
reuse
of
which
they
disapprove
was
west
legally
required
to
license
would
all
this
amount
to
a
copyright
violation
it
is
worth
running
through
the
analysis
because
it
gives
a
beautiful
snapshot
of
the
rules
with
which
current
law
surrounds
musical
creation
today
a
song
is
generally
covered
by
at
least
two
copyrights
one
covers
the
musical
composition
the
sheet
music
and
the
lyrics
and
the
other
the
particular
sound
recording
of
that
composition
just
as
there
are
two
kinds
of
copyrights
so
there
are
at
least
two
kinds
of
borrowings
that
copyright
might
be
concerned
with
first
one
musical
composition
might
infringe
another
thus
for
example
a
court
found
that
george
harrison
subconsciously
based
his
song
my
sweet
lord
on
the
melody
of
he
so
fine
by
the
chiffons
how
much
does
it
take
to
infringe
that
is
a
difficult
question
the
law
standard
is
substantial
similarity
but
not
every
kind
of
similarity
counts
minimal
or
de
minimis
copying
of
tiny
fragments
is
ignored
certain
styles
or
forms
have
become
standards
for
example
the
basic
chord
structure
of
the
bar
blues
or
the
habit
of
introducing
instruments
one
at
a
time
from
quietest
to
loudest
there
are
only
so
many
notes
and
so
many
ways
to
rearrange
them
inevitably
any
song
will
be
similar
to
some
other
yet
that
can
not
mean
that
all
songs
infringe
copyright
finally
even
where
there
is
substantial
similarity
of
a
kind
that
copyright
is
concerned
with
the
second
artist
may
claim
fair
use
for
parody
or
criticism
say
copyright
law
in
other
words
has
tried
to
solve
the
problem
with
which
i
began
the
chapter
because
much
of
musical
creativity
is
organic
and
collective
and
additive
because
it
does
use
prior
musical
expression
some
copyright
decisions
have
tried
to
carve
out
a
realm
of
freedom
for
that
creativity
using
doctrines
with
names
such
as
scènes
à
faire
merger
and
fair
use
this
is
yet
another
example
of
judges
trying
to
achieve
the
balance
that
this
book
is
all
about
between
the
realm
of
the
protected
and
the
public
domain
recognizing
that
it
is
the
balance
not
the
property
side
alone
that
allows
for
new
creativity
the
second
type
of
potential
infringement
comes
when
someone
uses
a
fragment
of
the
earlier
recording
as
part
of
the
later
one
actually
copying
a
portion
of
the
recording
itself
and
using
it
in
a
new
song
one
might
imagine
the
same
rules
would
be
applied
de
minimis
copying
irrelevant
certain
standard
forms
unprotected
and
so
on
and
one
would
be
wrong
in
a
case
called
bridgeport
music
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
taking
even
two
notes
of
a
musical
recording
counts
as
potentially
actionable
copying
where
recordings
are
concerned
in
other
words
there
is
almost
no
class
of
copying
so
minimal
that
the
law
would
ignore
it
this
is
a
terrible
decision
at
least
in
my
opinion
likely
to
be
rejected
by
other
circuits
and
perhaps
even
eventually
by
the
supreme
court
but
for
the
moment
it
is
a
case
that
samplers
have
to
deal
with
how
does
kanye
west
fare
under
these
rules
he
may
sample
from
the
actual
recording
of
charles
song
it
is
hard
to
tell
he
certainly
copies
portions
of
the
melody
that
means
we
have
to
look
at
the
copyright
in
the
musical
composition
the
words
and
the
music
of
i
got
a
woman
for
a
copyright
infringement
one
needs
a
valid
copyright
and
evidence
of
copying
the
amount
copied
needs
to
be
more
than
an
insignificant
fragment
substantial
similarity
is
required
and
the
similarity
has
to
be
between
the
new
work
and
the
elements
of
the
original
that
are
actually
protected
by
copyright
elements
taken
from
the
public
domain
standard
introductions
musical
clichés
and
so
forth
do
not
get
included
in
the
calculation
of
similarity
finally
the
copier
can
claim
fair
use
that
his
borrowing
is
legally
privileged
because
it
is
commentary
criticism
parody
and
so
on
does
charles
or
his
record
company
have
a
valid
copyright
in
the
musical
composition
one
huge
problem
in
copyright
law
is
that
it
is
remarkably
hard
to
find
this
out
even
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
it
is
hard
for
an
artist
musician
or
teacher
to
know
what
is
covered
by
copyright
and
what
is
not
nowadays
all
works
are
copyrighted
as
soon
as
they
are
fixed
but
at
the
time
i
got
a
woman
was
written
one
had
to
include
a
copyright
notice
or
the
song
went
immediately
into
the
public
domain
the
copyright
office
database
shows
no
copyright
over
the
words
and
music
of
i
got
a
woman
there
are
copyrights
over
a
variety
of
recordings
of
the
song
if
west
is
using
a
fragment
of
the
recording
these
would
affect
him
but
the
melody
it
is
possible
that
the
underlying
musical
composition
is
in
the
public
domain
finding
out
whether
it
is
or
is
not
would
probably
cost
one
a
lot
of
money
suppose
that
charles
has
complied
with
all
the
formalities
the
words
and
music
were
published
with
a
copyright
notice
a
copyright
registration
was
filed
and
renewed
does
west
infringe
this
copyright
that
is
where
the
discovery
of
the
bailey
gospel
singers
recording
is
potentially
so
important
charles
only
gets
a
copyright
in
his
original
creation
those
elements
taken
from
the
public
domain
if
i
got
a
savior
was
indeed
in
the
public
domain
or
from
other
copyrighted
songs
do
not
count
the
irony
here
is
that
the
elements
that
kanye
west
borrows
from
ray
charles
are
almost
exactly
the
same
ones
ray
charles
borrows
from
the
bailey
gospel
singers
i
got
a
savior
oh
what
a
savior
becomes
i
got
a
woman
way
over
town
becomes
there
a
gold
digger
way
over
town
and
of
course
the
music
behind
those
words
is
even
more
similar
when
the
legendary
reached
for
kanye
west
song
in
order
to
criticize
bush
they
found
themselves
sampling
jamie
foxx
who
was
copying
ray
charles
who
was
copying
the
bailey
gospel
singers
who
themselves
may
have
borrowed
their
theme
from
an
older
spiritual
george
bush
does
care
five
damn
days
five
long
days
and
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
he
walking
in
like
hey
chilling
on
his
vacation
sitting
patiently
them
black
folks
got
ta
hope
got
ta
wait
and
see
if
fema
really
comes
through
in
an
emergency
but
nobody
seem
to
have
a
sense
of
urgency
now
the
mayor
been
reduced
to
crying
i
guess
bush
said
n
been
used
to
dying
he
said
i
know
it
looks
bad
just
have
to
wait
forgetting
folks
was
too
broke
to
evacuate
n
starving
and
they
dying
of
thirst
i
bet
he
had
to
go
and
check
on
them
refineries
first
making
a
killing
off
the
price
of
gas
he
would
have
been
up
in
connecticut
twice
as
fast
after
all
that
we
been
through
nothing
changed
you
can
call
red
cross
but
the
fact
remains
that
george
bush
ai
a
gold
digger
but
he
ai
f
ing
with
no
broke
n
s
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
the
legendary
the
song
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
was
an
immediate
sensation
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
downloaded
it
within
days
two
different
video
versions
had
been
made
one
by
franklin
lopez
and
another
by
a
filmmaker
called
the
black
lantern
both
synchronized
the
lyrics
of
the
song
with
news
clips
of
the
disaster
and
unsympathetic
footage
of
president
bush
apparently
ignoring
what
was
going
on
the
effect
was
both
hilarious
and
tragic
the
videos
were
even
more
popular
than
the
song
alone
the
blogosphere
was
fascinated
entries
were
posted
circulated
to
friends
with
the
usual
you
have
to
see
this
taglines
in
fact
the
song
was
so
popular
that
it
received
the
ultimate
recognition
of
an
internet
fad
the
new
york
times
wrote
a
story
on
it
setting
the
practice
in
historical
context
in
the
century
songwriters
responded
to
current
events
by
writing
new
lyrics
to
existing
melodies
benjamin
franklin
used
to
write
broadside
ballads
every
time
a
disaster
struck
said
elijah
wald
a
music
historian
and
sell
the
printed
lyrics
in
the
street
that
afternoon
this
tradition
of
responding
culturally
to
terrible
events
had
almost
been
forgotten
wald
said
but
in
the
wake
of
hurricane
katrina
it
may
be
making
a
comeback
with
the
obvious
difference
that
where
franklin
would
have
sold
a
few
song
sheets
to
his
fellow
philadelphians
the
internet
allows
artists
today
to
reach
the
whole
nickerson
and
randle
song
started
with
kanye
words
taken
from
the
fundraiser
with
mike
myers
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
from
there
it
launched
into
the
song
the
background
melody
comes
almost
entirely
from
a
looped
or
infinitely
repeated
version
of
the
hook
that
kanye
west
and
jamie
foxx
had
in
turn
taken
from
ray
charles
she
gim
me
money
when
i
in
need
i
got
ta
leave
against
that
background
the
legendary
provide
their
profane
and
angry
commentary
part
of
which
is
excerpted
above
with
a
chorus
of
george
bush
do
like
black
people
in
case
anyone
had
missed
the
point
the
videos
differ
in
the
issues
they
stress
franklin
movie
is
rather
pointedly
given
its
theme
just
black
and
white
he
uses
ornate
captions
pages
reminiscent
of
silent
film
from
the
to
make
political
points
against
the
background
of
the
song
and
the
news
footage
as
the
captions
read
katrina
rapidly
approaches
we
cut
to
a
shot
of
the
hurricane
the
president
ponders
on
what
to
do
we
have
a
shot
of
bush
playing
golf
i
think
i
ride
this
one
out
bush
is
shown
relaxing
on
a
golf
cart
juxtaposed
against
pictures
of
wading
through
the
floods
the
captions
add
as
an
afterthought
and
keep
dealing
with
the
brown
people
pictures
of
soldiers
shooting
when
fema
michael
brown
is
shown
at
the
moment
when
bush
said
brownie
you
are
doing
a
hell
of
a
job
the
captions
comment
mockingly
the
horse
judge
to
the
rescue
lopez
video
obviously
tries
to
use
the
legendary
song
to
make
larger
political
arguments
about
the
country
for
example
it
asserts
that
in
bush
diverted
most
of
the
funds
for
the
levees
to
the
war
in
iraq
scenes
reminiscent
of
a
michael
moore
documentary
are
shown
there
are
pictures
of
the
iraq
war
halliburton
signs
and
shots
of
the
president
with
a
member
of
the
saudi
royal
family
the
captions
accuse
the
president
of
showing
insensitivity
and
disdain
to
racial
minorities
one
summarizes
the
general
theme
since
he
was
elected
president
george
bush
policies
have
been
less
than
kind
toward
africans
and
hispanics
issues
ranging
from
the
response
to
the
darfur
massacres
no
child
left
behind
and
the
attempted
privatization
of
social
security
also
make
their
appearance
the
video
concludes
by
giving
the
donation
information
for
the
red
cross
and
saying
that
we
are
onto
bush
a
picture
of
a
klansman
removing
his
hood
is
shown
with
the
image
manipulated
so
that
the
face
revealed
is
bush
the
black
lantern
video
is
just
as
angry
and
it
uses
some
of
the
same
footage
but
the
themes
it
picks
up
are
different
it
starts
with
a
logo
that
parodies
the
fbi
copyright
warning
shown
at
the
beginning
of
movies
warning
artist
supports
filesharing
please
distribute
freely
that
dissolves
into
a
picture
of
kanye
west
and
mike
myers
west
is
speaking
somewhat
awkwardly
as
he
goes
off
script
and
at
first
myers
is
nodding
though
he
starts
to
look
increasingly
worried
west
says
i
hate
the
way
they
portray
us
in
the
media
you
see
a
black
family
it
says
they
are
looting
you
see
a
white
family
it
says
they
are
looking
for
food
finally
west
says
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
and
the
camera
catches
myers
mute
appalled
reaction
then
the
song
begins
the
film
cuts
repeatedly
between
a
music
video
of
foxx
as
he
sang
the
lines
for
gold
digger
and
the
news
coverage
of
the
debacle
in
new
orleans
at
one
point
the
music
pauses
and
a
news
anchor
says
you
simply
get
chills
when
you
look
at
these
people
they
are
so
poor
and
so
black
the
song
resumes
here
the
message
is
simpler
the
media
coverage
is
biased
and
governmental
attention
slowed
because
of
negative
racial
stereotypes
and
lack
of
concern
about
black
people
some
readers
will
find
that
this
song
and
these
videos
capture
their
own
political
perspectives
perfectly
they
will
love
the
bitterly
ironic
and
obscene
outrage
at
the
government
failure
the
double
standards
of
the
press
and
the
disproportionate
and
callously
disregarded
impact
on
the
poor
and
black
others
will
find
both
song
and
films
to
be
stupid
insulting
and
reductionist
an
attempt
to
find
racial
prejudice
in
a
situation
that
at
worst
was
an
example
of
good
governmental
incompetence
still
others
will
find
the
language
just
too
to
even
think
about
the
message
whatever
your
feelings
about
the
content
i
urge
you
to
set
them
aside
for
a
moment
for
better
or
worse
bush
just
happened
to
be
president
at
the
moment
when
the
internet
was
coming
into
its
own
as
a
method
of
distributing
digitally
remixed
political
commentary
which
itself
has
recently
become
something
that
amateurs
can
do
for
pennies
rather
than
an
expensive
activity
reserved
to
professionals
the
point
is
that
whatever
rules
we
apply
to
deal
with
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
will
also
apply
to
the
next
video
that
alleges
corruption
in
a
democratic
administration
or
that
attacks
the
sacred
cows
of
the
left
rather
than
the
right
how
should
we
think
about
this
kind
of
activity
this
taking
the
songs
and
films
and
photos
of
others
and
remixing
them
to
express
political
satirical
parodic
or
simply
funny
points
of
view
sampling
let
us
begin
with
the
music
unlike
the
other
songs
i
have
discussed
here
with
the
possible
exception
of
west
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
makes
use
of
digital
samples
of
the
work
of
others
in
other
words
this
is
not
merely
about
copying
the
tune
or
the
lyrics
the
reason
that
nickerson
and
randle
could
make
and
distribute
this
song
so
fast
and
so
cheaply
is
that
they
took
fragments
from
the
recording
of
gold
digger
and
looped
them
to
form
the
background
to
their
own
rap
that
was
also
part
of
the
reason
for
the
positive
public
reaction
kanye
west
and
ray
charles
and
clara
ward
are
very
talented
musicians
west
song
was
already
all
over
the
airwaves
the
legendary
capitalized
on
that
just
as
benjamin
franklin
capitalized
on
the
familiarity
of
the
songs
he
reworded
but
where
franklin
could
only
take
the
tune
the
legendary
could
take
the
actual
ones
and
zeros
of
the
digital
sound
file
as
i
mentioned
earlier
there
are
two
types
of
copyright
protection
over
music
there
is
the
copyright
over
the
musical
composition
and
a
much
more
recent
phenomenon
the
copyright
over
the
actual
recording
this
song
potentially
infringes
both
of
them
readers
who
came
of
age
in
the
might
remember
the
music
of
public
enemy
and
a
dense
wall
of
sound
on
which
rap
lyrics
were
overlaid
that
wall
of
sound
was
in
fact
made
up
of
samples
sometimes
hundreds
of
tiny
samples
in
a
single
track
rap
and
musicians
proceeded
under
the
assumption
that
taking
a
fragment
of
someone
else
recording
was
as
acceptable
legally
and
aesthetically
as
a
jazz
musician
quoting
a
fragment
of
another
tune
during
a
solo
in
both
cases
the
use
of
quotation
is
a
defining
part
of
the
genre
a
harmless
or
even
complimentary
homage
or
so
they
thought
in
a
case
called
grand
upright
that
idea
was
the
rap
artist
biz
markie
had
extensively
sampled
gilbert
song
alone
again
naturally
for
his
own
song
alone
again
the
court
could
have
applied
the
rules
described
earlier
in
this
chapter
decided
whether
or
not
this
was
a
large
enough
usage
to
make
the
second
song
substantially
similar
to
the
original
discussed
whether
or
not
it
counted
as
a
fair
use
whether
markie
use
was
transformative
or
parodic
whether
it
was
going
to
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
market
for
the
original
weighed
the
issues
and
ruled
either
way
in
doing
so
there
would
have
been
some
nice
points
to
discuss
about
whether
or
not
the
breadth
of
fair
use
depends
in
part
on
the
practice
in
the
relevant
artistic
community
how
to
understand
parodic
reference
or
the
relevant
markets
for
the
work
biz
lawyers
had
asked
for
permission
to
use
the
sample
but
the
supreme
court
has
made
clear
that
seeking
permission
does
not
weigh
against
a
defense
of
fair
use
there
were
also
some
tricky
issues
about
the
breadth
of
legal
rights
over
recordings
the
right
was
of
relatively
recent
creation
and
had
some
interesting
limitations
underlying
it
all
was
a
more
fundamental
question
how
do
we
interpret
the
rules
of
copyright
so
as
to
encourage
musical
creativity
after
all
as
this
chapter
has
shown
borrowing
and
reference
are
a
fundamental
part
of
musical
practice
we
ought
to
think
twice
before
concluding
they
are
illegal
are
we
to
criminalize
jazz
condemn
charles
ives
and
if
not
what
is
the
carefully
crafted
line
we
draw
that
allows
some
of
those
uses
but
condemns
this
one
judge
duffy
however
was
uninterested
in
any
of
these
subtleties
thou
shalt
not
steal
has
been
an
admonition
followed
since
the
dawn
of
civilization
unfortunately
in
the
modern
world
of
business
this
admonition
is
not
always
followed
indeed
the
defendants
in
this
action
for
copyright
infringement
would
have
this
court
believe
that
stealing
is
rampant
in
the
music
business
and
for
that
reason
their
conduct
here
should
be
excused
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
herein
however
violates
not
only
the
seventh
commandment
but
also
the
copyright
laws
of
this
if
this
were
a
law
school
exam
it
would
get
a
maybe
a
c
given
grade
inflation
duffy
makes
all
of
the
errors
jefferson
warned
us
against
tangible
property
is
the
same
as
intellectual
property
songs
are
the
same
as
sheep
and
the
same
rules
can
apply
to
both
theft
is
theft
the
prior
injunctions
of
the
framers
and
the
courts
notwithstanding
we
do
not
need
to
think
carefully
about
the
precise
boundaries
of
intellectual
property
rights
or
worry
that
interpreting
them
too
broadly
is
as
bad
as
making
them
too
narrow
so
far
as
judge
duffy
is
concerned
the
tablets
on
mount
sinai
were
inscribed
with
an
absolute
injunction
against
digital
sampling
the
font
must
have
been
small
but
to
say
all
this
is
merely
to
scratch
the
surface
of
how
regrettable
a
decision
it
is
in
the
narrowest
and
most
formalistic
legal
terms
it
is
also
very
poor
judge
duffy
gives
not
a
single
citation
to
the
provisions
of
the
copyright
act
he
ignores
issues
of
de
minimis
copying
substantial
similarity
fair
use
and
the
differences
between
the
right
over
the
recording
and
that
over
the
composition
in
fact
he
quotes
the
bible
more
and
more
accurately
than
he
does
title
of
the
code
the
copyright
act
the
one
mention
he
makes
of
actual
copyright
law
is
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
when
he
refers
the
case
for
criminal
prosecution
when
i
first
read
this
case
i
seriously
wondered
for
a
moment
if
it
were
a
crude
parody
of
a
legal
opinion
written
by
someone
who
had
never
been
to
law
school
is
the
result
in
this
case
wrong
personally
i
do
not
think
so
it
is
possible
even
probable
that
a
conscientious
judge
who
bothered
to
read
the
law
could
go
through
a
careful
analysis
and
find
that
markie
use
went
beyond
de
minimis
copying
that
it
was
neither
creative
parodic
nor
short
enough
to
count
as
a
fair
use
the
judge
might
have
presumed
a
negative
effect
on
the
market
for
song
and
thus
could
have
ruled
that
it
was
a
copyright
infringement
in
doing
so
the
judge
would
have
to
give
some
guidance
to
future
courts
about
digital
sampling
the
most
likely
guidance
would
be
the
sample
here
is
so
extensive
and
so
unchanged
that
this
case
says
little
about
the
wider
musical
practice
of
sampling
judge
duffy
opinion
was
poor
not
because
of
the
result
he
reached
but
because
he
reached
it
in
an
overly
broad
and
judicially
inappropriate
way
that
became
a
guideline
for
future
cultural
creation
worse
still
the
industry
listened
to
him
in
excellent
books
on
this
issue
kembrew
mcleod
and
siva
vaidhyanathan
each
argue
that
grand
upright
was
a
disaster
for
rap
the
industry
practice
turned
full
circle
almost
overnight
now
every
sample
no
matter
how
tiny
had
to
be
cleared
licensed
from
the
owners
of
the
recording
as
they
tell
the
story
this
legal
change
caused
an
aesthetic
change
the
number
of
samples
in
an
average
song
dropped
precipitously
the
engaging
complexity
of
the
public
enemy
wall
of
sound
gave
way
to
the
simplistic
thumping
beat
and
unimaginative
synthesizer
lines
of
modern
rap
i
must
admit
to
sharing
mcleod
and
vaidhyanathan
musical
prejudices
the
causal
claim
is
harder
to
substantiate
but
industry
lawyers
and
musicians
both
agree
that
changes
in
the
understanding
of
the
law
had
a
major
role
in
transforming
the
practice
of
sampling
if
we
disregard
the
jefferson
warning
and
assume
the
recording
artist
has
absolute
property
rights
over
his
work
then
we
could
ignore
the
idea
that
forcing
people
to
pay
for
stuff
they
take
might
have
a
negative
effect
on
future
art
and
culture
theft
is
theft
i
might
be
able
to
make
art
much
more
easily
if
i
did
not
have
to
pay
for
the
paint
and
canvas
but
that
is
not
commonly
held
to
excuse
shoplifting
from
art
stores
but
if
we
take
the
jefferson
warning
seriously
then
intellectual
property
job
is
to
balance
the
need
to
provide
incentives
for
production
and
distribution
with
the
need
to
leave
future
creators
free
to
build
upon
the
past
reasonable
minds
will
differ
on
where
this
line
is
to
be
drawn
but
the
process
of
drawing
it
is
very
different
from
the
process
judge
duffy
had
in
mind
for
fifteen
years
critics
of
the
decision
waited
for
an
appeals
court
to
fix
the
law
in
this
area
when
the
case
of
bridgeport
music
dimension
films
came
up
they
thought
they
had
what
they
wanted
the
band
nwa
had
used
a
tiny
fragment
less
than
two
seconds
consisting
of
three
notes
of
a
guitar
solo
from
the
george
clinton
song
get
off
your
ass
and
jam
the
fragment
was
an
arpeggiated
chord
which
simply
means
that
you
strike
the
notes
of
the
chord
individually
and
in
sequence
it
was
in
fact
a
pretty
standard
deedly
sound
familiar
from
many
guitar
solos
nwa
then
heavily
distorted
this
fragment
and
looped
it
so
that
it
played
in
the
background
of
one
part
of
the
song
so
faintly
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
hear
and
completely
impossible
to
recognize
with
the
distortion
it
sounds
like
a
very
faint
and
distant
police
siren
a
company
called
bridgeport
music
owned
the
sound
recording
copyright
over
the
clinton
song
they
sued
nwa
response
was
predictable
this
was
classic
de
minimis
copying
which
the
law
did
not
touch
one
did
not
even
have
to
get
to
the
issue
of
fair
use
though
this
surely
would
be
one
the
appeals
court
did
not
waste
any
time
attempting
to
dignify
judge
duffy
decision
in
grand
upright
although
grand
upright
applied
a
test
in
a
sampling
case
we
have
not
cited
it
as
precedent
for
several
reasons
first
it
is
a
district
court
opinion
and
as
such
has
no
binding
precedential
value
second
although
it
appears
to
have
involved
claims
for
both
sound
recording
and
musical
composition
copyright
infringement
the
trial
judge
does
not
distinguish
which
he
is
talking
about
in
his
ruling
and
appears
to
be
addressing
primarily
the
musical
composition
copyright
third
and
perhaps
most
important
there
is
no
analysis
set
forth
to
indicate
how
the
judge
arrived
at
his
ruling
which
has
resulted
in
the
case
being
criticized
by
they
did
like
one
thing
about
the
decision
however
its
line
rule
thou
shalt
not
steal
lawyers
use
the
term
rule
to
refer
to
a
rule
that
is
very
easy
to
apply
to
the
facts
a
mph
speed
limit
is
a
rule
the
bridgeport
court
rejected
the
idea
that
sound
recording
copyrights
and
music
composition
copyrights
should
be
analyzed
in
the
same
way
they
wanted
to
set
a
clear
rule
defining
how
much
of
a
sound
recording
one
could
use
without
permission
how
much
nothing
to
be
precise
the
court
suggests
in
a
footnote
that
taking
a
single
note
might
be
acceptable
since
the
copyright
protection
only
covers
a
series
anything
more
however
is
clearly
off
limits
though
they
come
to
a
conclusion
that
if
anything
is
more
stringent
than
judge
duffy
they
do
so
very
differently
in
their
words
get
a
license
or
do
not
sample
effectively
the
court
concludes
that
the
sound
recording
copyright
is
different
enough
from
the
composition
copyright
that
a
court
could
reasonably
conclude
that
a
different
analysis
is
required
the
judges
are
fully
aware
that
copyright
must
balance
encouraging
current
creators
and
leaving
raw
material
to
future
creators
the
jefferson
warning
holds
no
novelty
for
them
but
they
conclude
that
a
clear
rule
will
do
because
if
the
costs
of
licenses
are
too
high
samplers
can
simply
recreate
the
riff
themselves
and
this
will
tend
to
keep
prices
reasonable
this
is
an
interesting
idea
why
does
this
not
happen
more
often
why
do
samplers
not
simply
recreate
james
drumbeat
from
funky
drummer
or
george
clinton
solo
from
get
off
your
ass
and
jam
musicians
offer
lots
of
different
answers
they
do
not
understand
the
distinction
the
court
is
drawing
so
the
market
never
develops
the
samples
themselves
can
not
be
replicated
because
the
music
has
all
kinds
of
overtones
from
the
historical
equipment
used
and
even
the
methods
of
recording
fundamentally
though
the
answer
seems
to
be
one
of
authenticity
ironically
enough
the
original
beats
have
a
totemic
significance
like
the
great
standard
chord
sequences
in
jazz
one
can
not
substitute
replicas
for
james
brown
funkiness
it
just
would
not
be
the
same
as
walter
benjamin
pointed
out
long
ago
in
the
work
of
art
in
the
age
of
mechanical
reproduction
cheap
copying
actually
increases
the
demand
for
the
court
economic
analysis
which
imagines
a
world
of
fungible
beats
produced
for
music
as
a
consumer
good
deals
poorly
with
such
motivations
when
the
court
first
released
its
decision
it
was
greeted
with
concern
even
by
recording
industry
representatives
who
might
have
been
expected
to
favor
it
because
it
appeared
to
do
away
with
not
only
the
de
minimis
limitation
on
copyright
some
portions
are
just
too
small
to
count
as
copying
but
the
fair
use
provisions
as
well
the
court
took
the
very
unusual
step
of
rehearing
the
case
and
amending
the
opinion
changing
it
in
a
number
of
places
and
adding
a
paragraph
that
stated
that
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
district
court
the
judge
there
was
free
to
consider
the
fair
use
defense
of
course
if
one
takes
this
seriously
and
for
the
constitutional
reasons
given
in
chapter
i
agree
that
the
court
has
no
power
to
write
fair
use
out
of
the
statute
it
undermines
the
supposedly
clear
rule
if
the
factors
of
fair
use
are
seriously
applied
how
can
a
note
excerpt
ever
fail
to
be
fair
use
and
if
we
always
have
to
do
a
conventional
fair
use
analysis
then
the
apparent
clarity
of
the
rule
is
an
illusion
the
bridgeport
decision
is
a
bad
one
i
believe
among
other
things
it
fails
to
take
seriously
the
constitutional
limitations
on
copyright
including
the
originality
requirement
and
the
first
amendment
a
sample
is
not
original
enough
to
be
protected
under
copyright
law
in
my
view
there
are
also
more
issues
in
sampling
than
the
court
seems
to
realize
the
competitive
licensing
market
the
court
imagines
seems
more
like
economic
fantasy
than
reality
i
think
the
ruling
sets
unnecessary
barriers
on
musical
creation
and
ends
up
with
a
rule
that
is
just
as
blurry
as
the
one
it
criticizes
i
think
the
court
reading
of
the
statute
and
legislative
history
is
wrong
though
i
have
not
bored
you
with
the
full
details
of
that
argument
but
i
want
to
be
clear
that
it
is
a
very
different
kind
of
bad
decision
from
judge
duffy
the
court
in
bridgeport
does
see
copyright
as
a
balance
it
does
understand
the
need
for
future
creators
to
build
on
the
past
but
it
also
shows
that
a
simple
willingness
to
look
upon
intellectual
property
protections
in
a
utilitarian
way
does
not
solve
all
problems
it
certainly
does
not
proceed
from
jefferson
presumption
that
intellectual
property
protections
should
be
interpreted
narrowly
though
it
claims
to
have
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
the
real
driving
force
in
the
analysis
is
an
unconsummated
desire
for
rules
and
a
belief
that
the
market
will
solve
these
problems
by
itself
the
court
also
suggests
that
i
f
this
is
not
what
congress
intended
or
is
not
what
they
would
intend
now
it
is
easy
enough
for
the
record
industry
as
they
have
done
in
the
past
to
go
back
to
congress
for
a
clarification
or
change
in
the
law
note
the
assumption
that
the
record
industry
is
the
most
reliable
guide
to
congress
intentions
or
that
it
is
the
only
entity
affected
by
such
a
rule
this
is
truly
the
image
of
copyright
law
as
a
contract
among
affected
industries
of
course
digital
artists
such
as
the
legendary
hardly
fit
within
such
a
model
under
the
rule
in
bridgeport
get
a
license
or
do
not
sample
randle
and
nickerson
appear
to
be
breaking
the
law
they
did
not
get
a
license
and
they
most
definitely
did
sample
what
about
fair
use
under
fair
use
copyright
allows
a
very
specific
and
possibly
lengthy
use
of
another
material
when
the
purpose
is
parody
of
that
prior
work
itself
the
supreme
court
gave
parody
a
unique
status
in
the
case
the
extremely
profane
rap
group
live
crew
had
asked
for
permission
to
produce
a
version
of
roy
orbison
pretty
woman
but
where
orbison
sang
about
the
pretty
woman
walking
down
the
street
whom
he
would
like
to
meet
live
crew
wrote
about
a
big
hairy
woman
with
hair
that
ai
legit
you
look
like
cousin
it
they
sang
about
a
bald
headed
woman
with
a
teeny
weeny
afro
they
sang
about
group
sex
with
both
women
finally
they
told
a

woman
now
i
know
the

ai
mine
justice
souter
showed
the
characteristic
sangfroid
of
a
supreme
court
justice
faced
with
raunchy
rap
music
while
we
might
not
assign
a
high
rank
to
the
parodic
element
here
we
think
it
fair
to
say
that
live
crew
song
reasonably
could
be
perceived
as
commenting
on
the
original
or
criticizing
it
to
some
degree
live
crew
juxtaposes
the
romantic
musings
of
a
man
whose
fantasy
comes
true
with
degrading
taunts
a
bawdy
demand
for
sex
and
a
sigh
of
relief
from
paternal
responsibility
the
later
words
can
be
taken
as
a
comment
on
the
naiveté
of
the
original
of
an
earlier
day
as
a
rejection
of
its
sentiment
that
ignores
the
ugliness
of
street
life
and
the
debasement
that
it
signifies
it
is
this
joinder
of
reference
and
ridicule
that
marks
off
the
author
choice
of
parody
from
the
other
types
of
comment
and
criticism
that
traditionally
have
had
a
claim
to
fair
use
protection
as
transformative
emphasis
added
truly
the
law
can
confront
and
master
all
cultural
forms
the
heart
of
parody
as
the
supreme
court
described
it
is
that
one
is
taking
aim
at
the
original
because
live
crew
could
be
seen
as
directing
their
song
at
orbison
original
rather
than
using
orbison
song
to
make
some
other
political
or
social
point
the
court
was
willing
to
give
it
the
favorable
consideration
that
parody
receives
as
a
fair
use
does
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
fit
that
model
the
legendary
were
not
taking
aim
at
gold
digger
true
they
quoted
west
actual
words
from
the
television
broadcast
also
copyrighted
they
even
used
them
as
their
title
but
they
were
not
taking
aim
at
his
song
ironically
kanye
west
has
a
better
claim
that
he
was
taking
aim
at
ray
charles
picture
of
womanhood
in
just
the
way
described
in
the
live
crew
case
rather
the
legendary
were
using
the
sample
of
the
song
as
the
backing
to
an
entirely
different
rap
that
expressed
in
familiar
and
popular
musical
form
a
more
expansive
version
of
his
condemnation
of
both
press
and
president
that
does
not
end
the
inquiry
parody
is
not
the
only
form
of
protected
criticism
or
commentary
but
it
makes
it
much
harder
for
them
to
succeed
particularly
in
light
of
the
hostility
toward
sampling
betrayed
by
both
grand
upright
and
bridgeport
the
videos
made
by
the
black
lantern
and
franklin
lopez
present
an
even
more
complex
set
of
questions
on
top
of
the
music
copyright
issues
we
also
have
fair
use
claims
for
the
extensive
news
footage
and
footage
of
foxx
the
black
lantern
also
used
some
fragments
of
a
popular
video
by
which
had
a
cartoon
bush
and
kerry
singing
dueling
parodied
versions
of
woody
guthrie
this
land
when
jibjab
video
first
came
out
the
guthrie
estate
claimed
copyright
infringement
over
the
song
assisted
by
a
number
of
public
interest
legal
groups
jibjab
claimed
fair
use
it
eventually
came
out
that
the
copyright
over
the
song
was
no
longer
valid
what
did
do
when
the
black
lantern
sampled
them
in
their
turn
in
a
move
that
both
wins
the
prize
for
hypocrisy
and
serves
to
sum
up
the
intersection
of
law
and
culture
i
have
been
describing
they
sent
him
a
cease
and
desist
letter
the
video
was
taken
down
for
a
week
and
he
was
eventually
forced
to
remove
the
segment
of
their
video
from
his
work
fair
use
for
me
but
not
for
thee
conclusion
the
legendary
samples
kanye
west
who
uses
a
fragment
from
ray
charles
who
may
have
taken
material
from
will
lamartine
thompson
or
more
likely
from
clara
ward
who
herself
borrowed
from
a
gospel
standard
the
chain
of
borrowing
i
describe
here
has
one
end
in
the
hymns
and
spirituals
of
the
early
and
the
other
in
the
century
chaotic
stew
of
digital
sampling
remix
and
mashup
along
the
way
we
have
the
synthesis
of
old
and
the
invention
of
new
musical
genres
often
against
the
wishes
of
those
whose
work
is
serving
as
the
raw
material
one
way
of
viewing
this
story
is
that
each
of
these
musicians
except
for
some
imaginary
original
artist
the
musical
source
of
the
nile
is
a
plagiarist
and
a
pirate
if
they
are
licensing
their
material
or
getting
it
from
the
public
domain
then
they
may
not
be
lawbreakers
but
they
are
still
unoriginal
slavish
imitators
if
one
image
of
creativity
is
that
of
the
romantic
iconoclastic
creator
who
invents
the
world
anew
with
each
creation
those
conclusions
seem
entirely
appropriate
the
borrowing
here
is
rampant
far
from
building
everything
anew
these
musicians
seem
quite
deliberately
to
base
their
work
on
fragments
taken
from
others
it
is
important
to
remember
that
copyright
does
not
subscribe
completely
to
the
idea
of
romantic
creation
where
music
is
concerned
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
musical
genres
develop
out
of
other
genres
soul
from
gospel
and
rhythm
and
blues
gospel
from
spirituals
rhythm
and
blues
from
jazz
jump
music
and
delta
blues
and
so
on
when
it
comes
to
genres
we
can
play
the
game
of
musicological
six
degrees
of
separation
all
day
long
copyright
is
supposed
to
leave
holes
in
its
coverage
so
that
the
genre
is
not
covered
only
the
specific
form
of
creativity
within
the
genre
i
mentioned
before
the
need
to
keep
the
lines
of
genre
and
form
open
to
keep
them
free
from
private
property
rights
in
order
to
allow
musicians
to
develop
the
form
by
using
them
as
common
property
the
highways
of
musical
progress
so
for
example
the
blues
uses
the
first
fourth
and
fifth
chords
in
a
scale
that
sequence
can
not
be
owned
unless
blues
is
to
become
impossible
or
illegal
bebop
is
characterized
by
copious
use
of
the
flattened
fifth
a
sound
which
was
jarring
to
audiences
when
it
was
first
introduced
and
which
marked
the
break
with
the
more
accessible
jazz
of
swing
and
the
big
bands
the
flattened
fifth
is
not
owned
these
characteristic
creating
sequences
or
sounds
are
supposed
to
be
left
in
the
public
domain
though
increasingly
some
scholars
including
me
are
coming
to
believe
that
we
have
managed
to
make
the
copyright
holder
control
so
complete
and
so
granular
as
to
close
those
common
areas
and
impede
the
development
of
future
musical
forms
the
bridgeport
court
might
extend
its
logic
and
imagine
that
the
entire
musical
commons
could
be
licensed
of
course
the
presence
of
other
chord
sequences
would
keep
the
price
down
but
up
to
now
we
have
not
gone
that
far
in
theory
at
least
copyright
is
not
supposed
to
stop
the
next
ray
charles
the
person
who
wants
to
fuse
two
older
forms
of
music
to
create
a
third
yet
the
chain
of
borrowing
that
links
the
legendary
kanye
west
ray
charles
and
the
bailey
gospel
singers
is
of
a
different
kind
this
borrowing
involves
taking
chunks
of
prior
musicians
melodies
their
words
their
lyrical
patterns
this
is
not
just
copying
the
genre
it
is
copying
the
lines
of
the
song
within
the
genre
this
is
the
kind
of
stuff
copyright
is
supposed
to
regulate
even
when
it
is
working
well
and
yet
listening
to
the
sequence
it
is
hard
to
deny
that
at
each
stage
something
artistic
and
innovative
something
remarkable
has
been
created
in
fact
the
story
of
this
song
is
the
striking
ability
of
each
set
of
artists
to
impose
their
own
sound
temperament
spirituality
humor
vision
of
women
or
in
the
case
of
the
legendary
their
intense
and
profane
political
anger
onto
the
musical
phrases
they
have
in
common
the
postmodern
conclusion
here
is
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
that
all
creation
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
originality
merely
endless
imitation
if
this
is
meant
to
be
a
comment
about
how
things
get
created
at
least
in
music
i
think
there
is
some
truth
to
it
but
if
it
is
a
claim
about
aesthetic
worth
a
denial
that
there
are
more
and
less
creative
individuals
in
the
arts
i
find
it
as
facile
and
unconvincing
as
its
romantic
authorial
opposite
what
is
fascinating
about
the
artists
i
describe
here
is
that
while
they
do
not
fit
neatly
into
either
the
aesthetic
ideal
of
independent
creation
or
the
legal
model
for
how
creative
expression
gets
made
they
each
have
a
remarkable
palpable
creativity
each
leaves
us
with
something
new
even
if
formed
partly
from
the
fragments
of
the
past
one
could
describe
ray
charles
as
the
merest
plagiarist
making
search
and
replace
songs
by
substituting
a
woman
for
the
deity
in
established
hits
but
if
that
is
our
conclusion
it
merely
proves
that
our
theories
of
aesthetics
are
poorer
than
the
creativity
they
seek
to
describe
so
much
the
worse
for
the
theories
as
jefferson
pointed
out
the
lines
surrounding
intellectual
property
are
hard
to
draw
something
the
bridgeport
court
got
right
when
we
draw
them
whether
legally
or
as
a
matter
of
aesthetic
morality
we
do
so
partly
with
standard
instances
in
mind
well
that
ca
be
wrong
we
think
to
ourselves
and
reason
by
analogy
accordingly
yet
the
process
of
analogy
fails
us
sometimes
because
the
types
of
borrowing
change
over
time
ray
charles
was
frank
about
the
way
he
copied
the
style
and
licks
of
nat
king
cole
like
an
apprentice
learning
from
a
lawyer
but
he
and
his
estate
assiduously
guarded
his
copyrights
against
more
modern
borrowing
they
found
to
be
inappropriate
judge
duffy
thunderously
denounces
biz
markie
it
is
harder
to
imagine
him
leveling
the
same
condemnation
at
dizzy
gillespie
charles
ives
oscar
peterson
or
for
that
matter
beethoven
though
all
of
them
made
copious
use
of
the
works
of
others
in
their
own
it
is
bizarre
to
imagine
a
rule
being
extended
to
composition
copyrights
and
applied
to
music
such
as
jazz
get
a
license
or
do
not
solo
i
think
not
does
it
make
any
more
sense
for
sampling
if
there
is
a
single
reason
i
told
the
story
of
these
songs
it
is
this
to
most
of
us
certainly
to
me
the
idea
that
copyright
encourages
creativity
and
discourages
the
reuse
of
material
created
by
others
seems
reasonable
of
course
i
would
want
to
apply
the
correctives
implied
by
the
jefferson
warning
to
make
sure
the
rights
were
as
short
and
as
narrow
as
possible
but
at
least
when
it
comes
to
copying
chunks
of
expression
still
covered
by
copyright
our
intuitions
are
to
encourage
people
to
create
their
own
work
rather
than
to
rely
on
remix
what
does
that
mean
in
the
world
of
music
as
the
story
i
have
told
here
seems
to
illustrate
even
musicians
of
unquestioned
originality
even
those
who
can
make
a
claim
to
having
created
a
new
musical
genre
sometimes
did
so
by
a
process
rather
more
like
collage
than
creation
out
of
nothing
taking
chunks
of
existing
work
that
were
proven
to
work
well
and
setting
them
in
a
new
context
or
frame
imagine
ray
charles
trying
to
create
i
got
a
woman
today
both
of
his
possible
sources
would
be
strongly
and
automatically
protected
by
copyright
the
industries
in
which
those
works
were
produced
would
be
much
more
legalistic
and
infinitely
more
litigious
the
owners
of
those
copyrights
could
use
them
to
stop
him
from
desecrating
their
work
which
is
literally
what
he
is
doing
we
know
clara
ward
objected
to
charles
other
borrowings
from
gospel
i
can
not
imagine
will
lamartine
thompson
or
his
worthy
neighbors
in
east
liverpool
looking
kindly
on
the
sweet
early
morning
loving
outside
of
wedlock
described
in
i
got
a
woman
still
less
the
use
of
sacred
music
to
glorify
it
and
copyright
gives
them
the
power
to
say
no
remember
description
of
how
richardson
novels
might
have
been
censored
by
a
moralistic
heir
even
if
the
objections
were
not
vetoes
but
simple
demands
for
payment
would
we
get
i
got
a
woman
and
this
little
girl
of
mine
given
the
extent
of
the
borrowing
that
this
particular
effort
would
we
be
likely
to
see
the
birth
of
soul
music
congress
assures
us
that
the
many
increases
in
copyright
protection
have
been
in
the
name
of
encouraging
creativity
the
music
industry
says
the
same
thing
when
its
pettifogging
clearance
procedures
and
permission
culture
are
criticized
but
do
we
really
think
we
are
more
likely
to
get
a
century
ray
charles
or
a
fusion
of
styles
to
create
a
new
genre
in
the
world
we
have
made
do
we
really
think
that
the
formalist
ignorance
of
judge
duffy
or
the
market
optimism
of
the
bridgeport
court
in
which
thick
markets
offer
fungible
sets
of
samples
to
be
traded
like
commodities
are
good
guides
for
the
future
of
music
are
we
in
fact
killing
musical
creativity
with
the
rules
that
are
supposed
to
defend
it
an
internet
optimist
would
tell
us
that
is
precisely
the
point
true
because
of
the
errors
described
in
the
chapter
on
the
jefferson
warning
and
the
mistakes
catalogued
in
the
chapters
on
the
internet
threat
and
the
farmers
tale
we
have
dramatically
expanded
the
scope
length
and
power
of
the
rights
that
are
supposed
to
shape
our
creative
culture
but
technology
cures
all
look
at
the
legendary
the
black
lantern
or
franklin
lopez
they
are
all
probably
breaking
the
law
as
it
is
currently
interpreted
by
the
courts
but
their
work
can
be
created
for
pennies
and
distributed
to
millions
the
technology
allows
people
to
circumvent
the
law
admittedly
some
of
the
copyright
holders
will
police
their
rights
assiduously
think
of
jibjab
newfound
dislike
of
fair
use
and
their
power
to
alter
the
black
lantern
video
but
others
either
can
not
or
will
not
kanye
west
representatives
in
particular
are
unlikely
to
be
stupid
enough
to
sue
the
legendary
in
the
first
place
internet
distribution
becomes
a
demimonde
in
which
the
rules
of
the
rest
of
the
society
either
can
not
or
will
not
be
enforced
art
gets
its
breathing
room
not
from
legal
exceptions
but
from
technological
enforcement
difficulties
finally
as
more
and
more
people
can
create
and
distribute
digital
culture
they
are
less
likely
to
understand
believe
in
or
accept
rules
that
are
strongly
at
variance
with
their
aesthetic
and
moral
assumptions
there
is
a
lot
to
these
points
the
technology
does
transform
the
conditions
of
creativity
and
sometimes
it
runs
right
over
the
law
in
the
process
thousands
even
millions
can
be
reached
outside
of
conventional
distribution
channels
with
work
that
is
technically
illegal
and
attitudes
toward
creative
propriety
do
not
track
legal
rules
when
i
wrote
to
randle
and
nickerson
i
found
that
they
realized
west
probably
had
a
legal
right
to
get
their
work
taken
down
but
they
felt
he
would
not
use
it
and
they
had
a
very
commonsensical
conception
of
what
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
do
they
were
not
making
any
money
from
this
they
were
making
a
political
point
drawing
attention
to
a
political
and
human
problem
that
made
it
okay
they
would
have
liked
more
formal
permission
so
that
they
could
actually
distribute
cds
through
conventional
channels
perhaps
with
some
portion
of
the
proceeds
going
to
disaster
relief
but
they
understood
they
were
unlikely
to
get
it
despite
all
this
i
am
uncomfortable
with
the
argument
do
not
worry
technology
will
allow
us
to
evade
the
rules
where
they
are
stupid
a
system
that
can
only
function
well
through
repeated
lawbreaking
is
an
unstable
and
dangerous
one
it
breeds
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
law
in
those
who
should
be
its
greatest
supporters
and
beneficiaries
it
blurs
civil
disobedience
and
plain
old
lawbreaking
sitting
in
on
the
segregated
lunch
counter
and
being
willing
to
face
the
consequences
is
very
different
from
parking
in
the
disabled
space
and
hoping
you
can
get
away
with
it
it
also
blurs
our
judgment
of
conduct
whatever
one
thinks
of
them
the
legendary
are
doing
something
very
different
than
a
college
student
who
just
does
not
want
to
pay
for
music
and
downloads
thousands
of
tracks
for
free
from
file
sharing
networks
the
problem
is
not
simply
one
of
blurring
freedoms
are
not
reliable
though
legal
ones
too
may
fail
in
a
pinch
the
technology
may
not
save
you
as
thousands
of
those
same
downloaders
have
found
out
when
sued
by
the
riaa
and
forced
to
pay
thousands
of
dollars
for
an
activity
they
thought
to
be
private
and
anonymous
the
internet
solution
also
leaves
certain
types
of
artistic
creation
dependent
on
the
vagaries
of
the
current
technology
which
may
well
change
eliminating
some
of
the
zone
of
freedom
we
currently
rely
on
but
more
worrisome
is
the
fact
that
this
solution
actually
confines
certain
types
of
art
to
the
world
of
the
internet
the
video
of
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
could
be
seen
by
many
but
only
if
they
were
wired
to
the
right
technological
and
social
network
after
all
someone
has
to
tell
you
to
watch
it
was
a
searing
intervention
in
the
national
debate
on
katrina
but
it
appeared
on
no
television
station
like
most
of
the
mashups
created
online
the
fact
that
the
rights
could
never
be
cleared
keeps
it
off
mass
media
copyright
acts
as
the
barbed
wire
around
mass
media
outlets
that
is
a
shame
i
think
not
because
that
video
is
so
good
you
may
love
it
or
hate
it
but
because
this
kind
of
artwork
has
something
important
to
contribute
to
our
national
culture
imagine
a
world
in
which
ray
charles
could
create
i
got
a
woman
but
could
only
circulate
it
to
a
narrow
group
of
the
digerati
because
of
a
flagrant
violation
of
clara
ward
copyright
do
we
still
get
soul
the
blues
jazz
or
do
we
just
get
a
precious
and
insular
digital
subculture
whose
cultural
experiments
never
reach
the
mainstream
throughout
his
life
charles
described
an
intimate
relationship
with
his
audience
with
the
public
he
described
their
tastes
as
a
check
as
a
corrective
he
thought
they
would
actually
be
ahead
of
the
artists
he
wanted
to
make
songs
that
would
be
listened
to
by
tens
of
millions
of
people
and
he
wanted
to
make
art
and
lots
of
money
i
am
all
for
the
person
who
wants
to
create
as
an
and
distribute
outside
the
chains
of
commerce
i
have
worked
with
organizations
that
make
it
easier
to
do
this
but
i
also
believe
in
the
power
and
creativity
of
commercial
culture
and
political
speech
carried
on
mass
media
ironically
our
current
copyright
system
serves
it
poorly
what
is
the
solution
to
all
of
this
the
music
business
runs
on
compulsory
licenses
a
legally
granted
ability
to
use
music
in
certain
ways
without
permission
though
with
a
fee
the
system
seems
to
function
pretty
well
one
solution
is
to
extend
that
system
to
the
world
of
mashups
and
derivative
works
if
you
merely
copy
the
whole
of
my
work
and
circulate
it
on
file
sharing
networks
or
on
cds
we
apply
the
current
rules
and
penalties
if
on
the
other
hand
you
make
a
derivative
work
mixing
your
work
with
mine
then
there
are
two
alternatives
if
you
stay
in
the
world
of
nonprofit
exchange
you
get
a
heightened
presumption
in
favor
of
fair
use
perhaps
administered
through
a
quicker
and
cheaper
system
of
arbitration
if
you
move
into
the
world
then
you
must
pay
a
flat
licensing
fee
or
percentage
of
profits
to
the
copyright
holder
a
second
solution
would
be
to
curtail
the
hypertrophy
of
protectionism
that
made
all
this
happen
in
the
first
place
the
copyright
term
could
be
shortened
or
we
could
require
renewal
every
years
there
are
international
treaties
that
currently
forbid
the
latter
alternative
we
could
cut
back
on
excesses
like
the
bridgeport
decision
create
incentives
to
make
the
music
industry
less
legalistically
insistent
on
policing
the
most
atomic
level
of
creation
we
could
exempt
samples
shorter
than
five
seconds
from
copyright
liability
clarify
the
boundaries
of
fair
use
and
extend
it
beyond
parody
to
other
forms
such
as
satire
and
collage
there
are
enormous
obstacles
to
all
these
proposals
in
particular
while
artists
fare
very
poorly
under
the
current
clearance
culture
paying
but
not
receiving
the
benefits
of
payments
the
middlemen
who
profit
from
transaction
costs
are
not
keen
on
abolishing
them
certainly
if
as
the
bridgeport
court
assumed
the
recording
industry
is
the
party
responsible
for
copyright
law
we
are
hardly
likely
to
see
any
reforms
that
threaten
current
modes
of
doing
business
yet
there
is
a
ray
of
hope
it
is
getting
harder
and
harder
to
pretend
that
the
rules
ostensibly
designed
to
encourage
creativity
are
actually
working
at
the
same
time
more
and
more
people
are
creating
and
distributing
cultural
objects
becoming
subjects
of
intellectual
property
law
in
the
process
often
to
their
dismay
and
irritation
it
is
in
that
conjunction
a
far
cry
from
the
industry
contract
envisioned
by
the
bridgeport
court
that
hope
for
the
future
of
copyright
law
treatment
of
culture
might
lie
chapter
the
enclosure
of
science
and
technology
two
case
studies
over
the
last
forty
years
much
has
changed
in
the
way
that
scientific
research
and
technological
development
are
organized
funded
and
institutionally
arranged
much
has
also
changed
in
the
type
of
scientific
and
technical
material
that
is
covered
by
intellectual
property
rights
the
ways
that
material
is
covered
the
parties
who
hold
the
rights
and
the
state
of
research
and
development
at
which
rights
claims
are
made
many
academics
who
study
both
science
organizational
structure
and
the
intellectual
property
claims
that
surround
it
are
concerned
about
the
results
to
say
this
is
not
to
conjure
up
a
tragically
lost
world
of
pure
research
science
untainted
by
property
claims
or
profit
motives
that
world
never
existed
and
it
is
probably
a
good
thing
too
intellectual
property
rights
and
the
profit
motive
more
generally
have
a
vital
and
beneficial
role
in
moving
innovations
from
lab
bench
to
bedside
from
computer
simulation
to
actual
flight
the
question
is
not
whether
intellectual
property
rights
are
useful
as
part
of
scientific
and
technological
development
the
question
is
what
type
of
rights
they
should
be
where
in
the
research
process
those
rights
are
best
deployed
how
they
should
coexist
with
state
funded
basic
scientific
and
technological
research
how
broad
they
should
be
how
they
should
deal
with
new
technologies
how
long
they
should
last
how
they
should
treat
innovations
i
can
not
hope
here
to
answer
all
those
questions
though
some
fascinating
research
has
begun
the
process
instead
as
with
the
music
chapter
i
will
offer
a
case
study
actually
two
case
studies
that
try
to
illuminate
the
process
i
am
describing
to
illustrate
its
pitfalls
and
its
strange
and
unintended
consequences
the
two
defining
technologies
of
the
last
thirty
years
are
biotechnology
and
the
networked
computer
each
is
both
product
and
platform
innovations
themselves
they
are
also
constitutive
technologies
that
enable
still
more
innovations
but
at
several
historical
moments
in
the
development
of
each
we
came
perilously
close
to
breaking
technology
with
some
would
say
that
it
was
not
just
a
close
shave
we
actually
have
hampered
or
limited
the
full
potential
of
technology
slowing
down
its
dynamism
with
a
host
of
overbroad
software
patents
gene
patents
and
materials
transfer
agreements
others
are
more
optimistic
they
think
that
a
series
of
rapid
improvisations
by
courts
scientists
programmers
and
businesspeople
has
largely
mitigated
any
problems
caused
by
the
process
of
legal
but
if
mistakes
were
made
it
is
important
to
know
what
they
were
lest
we
continue
or
repeat
them
if
there
were
fixes
it
is
important
to
know
if
they
can
be
replicated
so
were
there
mistakes
if
so
have
they
been
fixed
and
how
drawing
on
an
article
i
with
my
brilliant
colleague
arti
this
chapter
suggests
some
answers
to
those
questions
by
sketching
out
some
details
of
the
legal
history
of
those
technologies
concluding
with
a
discussion
of
a
single
promising
new
technology
that
shares
aspects
of
both
synthetic
biology
the
answers
are
important
behind
the
abstract
words
innovation
or
technological
development
there
are
lives
saved
or
lost
communicative
freedoms
expanded
or
contracted
communities
enabled
or
stunted
wealth
generated
or
not
the
subject
would
benefit
from
informed
sophisticated
democratic
attention
it
is
not
something
you
want
to
leave
a
host
of
lawyers
and
lobbyists
to
decide
among
themselves
a
machine
that
contains
all
other
machines
imagine
a
person
staring
at
an
infinite
roll
of
paper
tape
on
the
paper
are
symbols
in
some
alphabet
or
number
system
the
reader
carries
out
simple
operable
instructions
on
the
basis
of
that
data
add
together
the
next
two
digits
you
are
presented
with
and
write
down
the
answer
if
the
answer
is
odd
go
to
step
if
the
answer
is
even
go
to
step
now
replace
the
person
with
a
mechanical
head
that
can
read
the
instructions
carry
out
the
desired
operations
and
write
the
answer
down
the
british
mathematician
alan
turing
imagined
something
like
this
a
little
more
complicated
perhaps
but
fairly
similar
what
is
it
we
have
the
reading
head
the
set
of
instructions
the
data
on
which
the
instructions
are
to
be
performed
the
record
of
the
result
and
some
kind
of
state
table
that
tells
the
machine
where
it
is
in
the
process
these
are
the
component
parts
of
turing
machines
or
as
we
know
them
better
computers
more
accurately
turing
machines
are
a
method
of
simulating
the
operation
of
computers
a
metaphor
that
enables
us
to
imitate
their
logical
processes
in
the
words
of
wikipedia
despite
their
simplicity
they
can
be
adapted
to
simulate
the
logic
of
any
computer
that
could
possibly
be
constructed
and
to
give
lawyers
fits
but
that
is
getting
ahead
of
ourselves
in
greek
mythology
procrustes
had
a
bed
to
which
he
fitted
its
prospective
occupants
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
the
tall
were
trimmed
down
the
short
stretched
on
the
rack
intellectual
property
lawyers
have
many
similarities
to
procrustes
the
technologies
that
are
brought
before
them
are
made
to
fit
the
conceptual
boxes
the
law
provides
boxes
with
names
such
as
copyright
and
patent
occasionally
new
conceptual
boxes
are
made
but
for
very
good
reasons
most
of
the
time
we
stick
with
the
boxes
we
have
as
with
procrustes
things
do
not
always
fit
and
the
process
can
be
distressing
for
its
subjects
it
is
important
to
realize
that
the
process
of
trimming
and
stretching
can
be
done
well
or
badly
if
it
is
done
really
badly
the
technology
is
stunted
deformed
even
destroyed
if
it
is
done
well
the
law
aids
the
development
of
the
technology
in
exactly
the
happy
way
described
in
chapter
what
did
our
procrustean
legal
system
do
with
computers
and
computer
science
i
will
focus
on
software
the
set
of
instructions
the
machine
is
to
perform
how
should
we
think
of
it
software
is
written
down
by
programmers
it
is
recorded
first
in
a
form
readable
to
humans
or
at
least
geeks
then
through
a
series
of
transformations
it
is
turned
into
the
machine
code
the
ones
and
zeros
that
will
operate
the
computer
but
at
its
root
it
can
be
understood
through
the
metaphor
of
the
simple
list
of
instructions
to
be
carried
out
in
order
just
as
with
the
turing
machine
and
its
infinite
tape
how
should
we
fit
software
into
the
categories
of
intellectual
property
we
have
writing
fixation
in
some
medium
of
symbols
that
can
be
read
by
others
both
machine
and
human
writing
is
normally
the
domain
of
copyright
are
computer
programs
copyrightable
all
kinds
of
problems
present
themselves
at
least
in
the
united
states
copyright
covers
expression
as
i
pointed
out
in
a
previous
book
at
its
base
is
the
conception
of
the
romantic
author
impressing
her
uniqueness
of
spirit
on
the
work
at
the
moment
of
writing
it
is
that
expressive
choice
not
the
facts
or
ideas
on
which
the
work
is
based
that
copyright
covers
and
it
is
only
original
expression
that
copyright
covers
it
does
not
cover
purely
functional
objects
systems
processes
or
methods
of
operation
one
can
not
copyright
the
coat
hanger
the
mousetrap
or
long
division
one
can
not
even
copyright
a
sculpture
if
the
main
function
of
its
design
is
to
serve
as
a
bicycle
rack
admittedly
one
can
copyright
some
expressive
works
that
serve
a
practical
purpose
a
book
about
how
to
do
bookkeeping
is
copyrightable
yet
copyright
covers
only
the
expressive
choices
used
in
selecting
the
words
to
explain
the
method
and
the
images
to
represent
it
not
the
methods
it
describes
or
the
facts
or
ideas
it
contains
can
copyright
cover
computer
programs
should
we
see
them
as
copyrightable
books
or
as
uncopyrightable
machines
made
of
words
machines
and
other
functional
innovations
are
normally
the
domain
of
patent
rights
one
can
patent
the
mousetrap
and
then
one
gets
an
exclusive
right
to
the
actual
mechanically
enabled
method
of
catching
mice
not
just
the
artistic
flourishes
on
the
blueprint
patents
have
more
demanding
criteria
than
copyrights
the
invention
needs
to
be
novel
and
have
utility
or
usefulness
i
can
not
get
a
patent
over
something
that
would
have
been
an
obvious
idea
to
an
insider
in
the
relevant
field
of
technology
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
or
phosita
in
the
jargon
of
patent
lawyers
but
once
i
get
my
patent
it
gives
me
a
very
strong
power
to
exclude
others
from
the
invention
even
if
they
came
up
with
it
independently
the
right
lasts
for
twenty
years
innovators
who
improve
on
my
idea
can
get
a
patent
on
that
improvement
they
can
block
me
from
using
the
improvement
i
can
block
them
from
using
the
original
invention
thus
we
have
an
incentive
to
negotiate
if
either
of
us
wants
to
bring
the
improved
innovation
to
market
so
where
did
software
fit
was
it
copyrightable
writing
or
patentable
invention
there
are
two
issues
here
the
first
is
whether
there
should
be
any
intellectual
property
rights
over
software
at
all
the
basic
case
for
that
proposition
is
simple
a
classic
example
of
the
public
goods
problem
described
in
the
first
chapter
software
costs
money
to
create
but
is
cheap
to
copy
when
a
youthful
bill
gates
wrote
his
letter
to
the
wonderfully
named
dobb
journal
of
computer
calisthenics
orthodontia
he
put
the
point
clearly
who
can
afford
to
do
professional
work
for
nothing
what
hobbyist
can
put
years
into
programming
finding
all
the
bugs
documenting
his
product
and
distribute
it
for
free
the
fact
is
no
one
besides
us
has
invested
a
lot
of
money
into
hobby
software
we
have
written
basic
and
are
writing
apl
and
apl
but
there
is
very
little
incentive
to
make
this
software
available
to
hobbyists
most
directly
the
thing
you
do
is
he
signed
the
letter
bill
gates
general
partner
the
hyphen
would
disappear
in
time
the
philosophy
stuck
around
though
there
are
quibbles
about
the
facts
in
letter
critics
claim
he
himself
did
a
lot
of
free
riding
on
public
domain
code
and
computer
time
his
basic
point
is
that
software
needs
to
be
protected
by
enforceable
property
rights
if
we
expect
it
to
be
effectively
and
sustainably
produced
some
software
developers
disagree
but
assuming
one
concedes
the
point
for
the
sake
of
argument
there
is
a
second
question
should
software
be
covered
by
copyright
or
patent
or
some
unidentified
third
option
in
practice
software
ended
up
being
covered
by
both
schemes
partly
because
of
actions
by
congress
which
included
several
references
to
software
in
the
copyright
act
and
partly
as
a
result
of
decisions
by
the
copyright
office
the
patent
and
trademark
office
and
judges
one
could
copyright
one
code
and
also
gain
a
patent
over
the
nonobvious
novel
and
useful
innovations
inside
the
software
at
first
it
was
the
use
of
copyright
that
stirred
the
most
concern
as
i
explained
in
the
last
chapter
copyright
seems
to
be
built
around
an
assumption
of
diverging
innovation
the
fountain
or
explosion
of
expressive
activity
different
people
in
different
situations
who
sit
down
to
write
a
sonnet
or
a
love
story
it
is
presumed
will
produce
very
different
creations
rather
than
being
drawn
to
a
single
result
thus
strong
rights
over
the
resulting
work
are
not
supposed
to
inhibit
future
progress
i
can
find
my
own
muse
my
own
path
to
immortality
creative
expression
is
presumed
to
be
largely
independent
of
the
work
of
prior
authors
raw
material
is
not
needed
copyright
is
about
sustaining
the
conditions
of
creativity
that
enable
an
individual
to
craft
out
of
thin
air
an
appalachian
spring
a
sun
also
rises
a
citizen
kane
there
are
lots
of
reasons
to
doubt
that
this
vision
of
creation
out
of
nothing
works
very
well
even
in
the
arts
the
traditional
domain
of
copyright
law
the
story
of
ray
i
got
a
woman
bears
ample
witness
to
those
doubts
but
whatever
its
merits
or
defects
in
the
realm
of
the
arts
the
vision
seems
completely
wrongheaded
when
it
comes
to
software
software
solutions
to
practical
problems
do
converge
and
programmers
definitely
draw
upon
prior
lines
of
code
worse
still
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
software
tends
to
exhibit
network
effects
unlike
my
choice
of
novel
my
choice
of
word
processing
program
is
very
strongly
influenced
perhaps
dominated
by
the
question
of
what
program
other
people
have
chosen
to
buy
that
means
that
even
if
a
programmer
could
find
a
completely
different
way
to
write
a
word
processing
program
he
has
to
be
able
to
make
it
read
the
dominant
program
files
and
mimic
its
features
if
he
is
to
attract
any
customers
at
all
that
hardly
sounds
like
completely
divergent
creation
seeing
that
software
failed
to
fit
the
procrustean
bed
of
copyright
many
scholars
presumed
the
process
of
forcing
it
into
place
would
be
catastrophic
they
believed
that
lacking
patent
high
standards
copyright
monopolies
would
proliferate
widely
copyright
treatment
of
or
derivative
works
would
impede
innovation
it
was
thought
the
force
of
network
effects
would
allow
the
copyright
holder
of
whatever
software
became
the
standard
to
extract
huge
monopoly
rents
and
prevent
competing
innovation
for
many
years
longer
than
the
patent
term
users
of
programs
would
be
locked
in
unable
to
shift
their
documents
data
or
acquired
skills
to
a
competing
program
doom
and
gloom
abounded
among
copyright
scholars
including
many
who
shared
gates
basic
premise
that
software
should
be
covered
by
property
rights
they
simply
believed
that
these
were
the
wrong
property
rights
to
use
copyright
did
indeed
cause
problems
for
software
developers
though
it
is
hard
to
judge
whether
those
problems
outweighed
the
economic
benefits
of
encouraging
software
innovation
production
and
distribution
but
the
negative
effects
of
copyright
were
minimized
by
a
remarkably
prescient
set
of
actions
by
courts
and
to
a
much
lesser
extent
congress
so
that
the
worst
scenarios
did
not
come
to
pass
courts
interpreted
the
copyright
over
software
very
narrowly
so
that
it
covered
little
beyond
literal
infringement
remember
jefferson
point
about
the
importance
of
being
careful
about
the
scope
of
a
right
they
developed
a
complicated
test
to
work
out
whether
one
program
infringed
the
details
of
another
the
details
give
law
students
headaches
every
year
but
the
effects
were
simple
if
your
software
was
similar
to
mine
merely
because
it
was
performing
the
same
function
or
because
i
had
picked
the
most
efficient
way
to
perform
some
task
or
even
because
there
was
market
demand
for
doing
it
that
way
then
none
of
those
similarities
counted
for
the
purposes
of
infringement
nor
did
material
that
was
taken
from
the
public
domain
the
result
was
that
while
someone
who
made
literal
copies
of
windows
vista
was
clearly
infringing
copyright
the
person
who
made
a
competing
program
generally
would
not
be
in
addition
courts
interpreted
the
fair
use
doctrine
to
cover
decompilation
which
is
basically
taking
apart
someone
program
so
that
you
can
understand
it
and
compete
with
it
as
part
of
the
process
the
decompiler
had
to
make
a
copy
of
the
program
if
the
law
were
read
literally
decompilation
would
hardly
seem
to
be
a
fair
use
the
decompiler
makes
a
whole
copy
for
a
commercial
purpose
of
a
copyrighted
work
precisely
in
order
to
cause
harm
to
its
market
by
offering
a
substitute
good
but
the
courts
took
a
broader
view
the
copy
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
process
of
producing
a
competing
product
rather
than
a
piratical
attempt
to
sell
a
copy
of
the
same
product
this
limitation
on
copyright
provided
by
fair
use
was
needed
in
order
to
foster
the
innovation
that
copyright
is
supposed
to
encourage
this
is
a
nice
variation
of
the
sony
axiom
from
chapter
these
rulings
and
others
like
them
meant
that
software
was
protected
by
copyright
as
gates
wanted
but
that
the
copyright
did
not
give
its
owner
the
right
to
prevent
functional
imitation
and
competition
is
that
enough
clearly
the
network
effects
are
real
most
of
us
use
windows
and
most
of
us
use
microsoft
word
and
one
very
big
reason
is
because
everyone
else
does
optimists
believe
the
lure
of
capturing
this
huge
market
will
keep
potential
competitors
hungry
and
monopolists
scared
the
lumbering
dominant
players
will
not
become
complacent
about
innovation
or
try
to
grab
every
morsel
of
monopoly
rent
goes
the
argument
they
still
have
to
fear
their
competitors
lurking
in
the
shadows
perhaps
or
perhaps
it
also
takes
the
consistent
threat
of
antitrust
enforcement
in
any
event
whether
or
not
we
hit
the
optimal
point
in
protecting
software
with
intellectual
property
rights
those
rights
certainly
did
not
destroy
the
industry
it
appeared
that
even
with
convergent
creativity
and
network
effects
software
could
be
crammed
into
the
procrustean
bed
of
copyright
without
killing
it
off
in
the
process
indeed
to
some
it
seemed
to
fare
very
well
they
would
claim
that
the
easy
legal
protection
provided
by
copyright
gave
a
nascent
industry
just
enough
protection
to
encourage
the
investment
of
time
talent
and
dollars
while
not
prohibiting
the
next
generation
of
companies
from
building
on
the
innovations
of
the
past
in
addition
the
interaction
between
copyright
and
software
has
produced
some
surprising
results
there
is
a
strong
argument
that
it
is
the
fact
that
software
is
copyrightable
that
has
enabled
the
creativity
of
free
and
open
source
software
what
does
creativity
mean
basically
it
is
creativity
that
builds
on
an
open
resource
available
to
all
an
additional
component
of
some
definitions
is
that
the
results
of
the
creativity
must
be
fed
back
into
the
commons
for
all
to
use
think
of
english
you
can
use
english
without
license
or
fee
and
you
can
innovate
by
producing
new
words
slang
or
phrases
without
clearance
from
some
academie
anglaise
after
you
coin
your
term
it
is
in
turn
available
to
me
to
build
upon
or
to
use
in
my
own
sentences
novels
or
jokes
and
so
the
cycle
continues
as
the
last
chapter
showed
for
the
entire
history
of
musical
creativity
until
the
last
forty
years
or
so
the
same
had
been
true
of
at
least
a
low
level
of
musical
borrowing
at
the
basic
level
of
musical
phrases
themes
snatches
of
melody
even
chord
structures
music
was
creativity
property
rights
did
not
reach
down
into
the
atomic
structure
of
music
they
stayed
at
a
higher
level
prohibiting
reproduction
of
complete
works
or
copying
of
substantial
and
important
chunks
so
in
some
areas
of
both
music
and
language
we
had
based
creativity
because
there
were
no
property
rights
over
the
relevant
level
the
software
commons
is
different
the
creators
of
free
and
open
source
software
were
able
to
use
the
fact
that
software
is
copyrighted
and
that
the
right
attaches
automatically
upon
creation
and
fixation
to
set
up
new
distributed
methods
of
innovation
for
example
free
and
open
source
software
under
the
general
public
license
such
as
linux
is
a
commons
to
which
all
are
granted
access
anyone
may
use
the
software
without
any
restrictions
they
are
guaranteed
access
to
the
source
code
rather
than
just
the
inscrutable
machine
code
so
that
they
can
understand
tinker
and
modify
modifications
can
be
distributed
so
long
as
the
new
creation
is
licensed
under
the
open
terms
of
the
original
this
creates
a
virtuous
cycle
each
addition
builds
on
the
commons
and
is
returned
to
it
the
copyright
over
the
software
was
the
hook
that
allowed
software
engineers
to
create
a
license
that
gave
free
access
and
the
right
to
modify
and
required
future
programmers
to
keep
offering
those
freedoms
without
the
copyright
those
features
of
the
license
would
not
have
been
enforceable
for
example
someone
could
have
modified
the
open
program
and
released
it
without
the
source
code
denying
future
users
the
right
to
understand
and
modify
easily
to
use
an
analogy
beloved
of
free
software
enthusiasts
the
hood
of
the
car
would
be
welded
shut
home
repair
tinkering
customization
and
redesign
become
practically
impossible
of
course
if
there
were
no
copyright
over
software
at
all
software
engineers
would
have
other
freedoms
even
if
not
legally
guaranteed
open
access
to
source
code
still
it
was
hard
to
deny
that
the
extension
of
the
property
regime
had
bizarrely
at
first
sight
actually
enabled
the
creation
of
a
continuing
open
commons
the
tempting
real
estate
analogy
would
be
environmentalists
using
strong
property
rights
over
land
to
guarantee
conservation
and
open
access
to
a
green
space
where
without
property
rights
the
space
could
be
despoiled
by
all
but
as
i
have
pointed
out
earlier
while
such
analogies
may
help
us
the
differences
between
land
and
intellectual
property
demand
that
they
be
scrutinized
very
carefully
it
is
hard
to
overgraze
an
idea
so
much
for
copyright
what
about
patents
patent
law
had
drawn
a
firm
line
between
patentable
invention
and
unpatentable
idea
formula
or
algorithm
the
mousetrap
could
be
patented
but
not
the
formula
used
to
calculate
the
speed
at
which
it
would
snap
shut
ideas
algorithms
and
formulae
were
in
the
public
domain
as
were
business
methods
or
so
we
thought
the
line
between
idea
or
algorithm
on
the
one
hand
and
patentable
machine
on
the
other
looks
nice
and
easy
but
put
that
algorithm
that
series
of
steps
capable
of
being
specified
in
the
way
described
by
the
turing
machine
onto
a
computer
and
things
begin
to
look
more
complex
say
for
example
that
algorithm
was
the
process
for
converting
miles
into
kilometers
and
vice
versa
take
the
first
number
if
it
is
followed
by
the
word
miles
then
multiply
by
if
it
is
followed
by
the
word
kilometers
multiply
by
and
so
on
in
the
abstract
this
is
classic
public
domain
stuff
no
more
patentable
than
or
what
about
when
those
steps
are
put
onto
the
tape
of
the
turing
machine
onto
a
program
running
on
the
hard
drive
of
a
computer
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
the
united
states
leading
patent
court
seems
to
believe
that
computers
can
turn
unpatentable
ideas
into
patentable
machines
in
fact
in
this
conception
the
computer
sitting
on
your
desk
becomes
multiple
patentable
machines
a
word
processing
machine
an
mail
machine
a
machine
running
the
program
to
calculate
the
tensile
strength
of
steel
i
want
to
stress
that
the
other
bars
to
patentability
remain
my
example
of
conversion
would
be
patentable
subject
matter
but
we
hope
no
patent
would
be
granted
because
the
algorithm
is
not
novel
and
is
obvious
sadly
the
patent
and
trademark
office
seems
determined
to
undermine
this
hope
by
granting
patents
on
the
most
mundane
and
obvious
applications
but
the
concern
here
is
not
limited
to
the
idea
that
without
a
subject
matter
bar
too
many
obvious
patents
will
be
granted
by
an
overworked
and
badly
incentivized
patent
office
it
is
that
the
patent
was
supposed
to
be
granted
at
the
very
end
of
a
process
of
investigation
and
scientific
and
engineering
innovation
the
formulae
algorithms
and
scientific
discoveries
on
which
the
patented
invention
was
based
remained
in
the
public
domain
for
all
to
use
it
was
only
when
we
got
to
the
very
end
of
the
process
with
a
concrete
innovation
ready
to
go
to
market
that
the
patent
was
to
be
given
yet
the
ability
to
couple
the
abstract
algorithm
with
the
concept
of
a
turing
machine
undermines
this
conception
suddenly
the
patents
are
available
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
process
even
to
people
who
are
merely
specifying
in
the
abstract
the
idea
of
a
computer
running
a
particular
series
of
algorithmic
activities
the
words
by
means
of
a
computer
are
in
the
eyes
of
the
federal
circuit
an
incantation
of
magical
power
able
to
transubstantiate
the
ideas
and
formulae
of
the
public
domain
into
private
property
and
like
the
breaking
of
a
minor
taboo
that
presages
a
victorian
literary
character
slide
into
debauchery
once
that
first
wall
protecting
the
public
domain
was
breached
the
court
found
it
easier
and
easier
to
breach
still
others
if
one
could
turn
an
algorithm
into
a
patentable
machine
simply
by
adding
by
means
of
a
computer
then
one
could
turn
a
business
method
into
something
patentable
by
specifying
the
organizational
or
information
technology
structure
through
which
the
business
method
is
to
be
implemented
if
you
still
remember
the
first
chapters
of
this
book
you
might
wonder
why
we
would
want
to
patent
business
methods
intellectual
property
rights
are
supposed
to
be
handed
out
only
when
necessary
to
produce
incentives
to
supply
some
public
good
incentives
that
otherwise
would
be
lacking
yet
there
are
already
plenty
of
incentives
to
come
up
with
new
business
methods
greed
and
fear
are
the
most
obvious
there
is
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
we
need
a
monopoly
to
encourage
the
development
of
new
business
methods
in
fact
we
want
people
to
copy
the
businesses
of
others
lowering
prices
as
a
result
the
process
of
copying
business
methods
is
called
competition
and
it
is
the
basis
of
a
economy
yet
patent
law
would
prohibit
it
for
twenty
years
so
why
introduce
patents
brushing
aside
such
minor
objections
with
ease
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
declared
business
methods
to
be
patentable
was
this
what
jefferson
had
in
mind
when
he
said
i
know
well
the
difficulty
of
drawing
a
line
between
the
things
which
are
worth
to
the
public
the
embarrassment
of
an
exclusive
patent
and
those
which
are
not
i
doubt
it
it
is
commonplace
for
courts
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
law
they
are
enforcing
when
seeking
to
understand
what
it
means
in
areas
of
regulation
which
are
obviously
instrumental
aimed
at
producing
some
particular
result
in
the
world
that
approach
is
ubiquitous
in
applying
the
antitrust
laws
for
example
courts
have
given
meaning
to
the
relatively
vague
words
of
the
law
by
turning
to
economic
analysis
of
the
likely
effects
of
different
rules
on
different
market
structures
patent
law
is
as
instrumental
a
structure
as
one
could
imagine
in
the
united
states
for
example
the
constitutional
authorization
to
congress
to
pass
patent
and
copyright
legislation
is
very
explicit
that
these
rights
are
to
be
made
with
a
purpose
in
view
congress
has
the
power
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
by
securing
for
limited
times
to
authors
and
inventors
the
exclusive
right
to
their
respective
writings
and
discoveries
one
might
imagine
that
courts
would
try
to
interpret
the
patent
and
copyright
laws
with
that
purpose
and
the
jefferson
warning
about
its
constraints
firmly
in
mind
yet
utilitarian
caution
about
extending
monopolies
is
seldom
to
be
found
in
the
reasoning
of
our
chief
patent
court
the
difference
is
striking
jefferson
said
that
the
job
of
those
who
administered
the
patent
system
was
to
see
if
a
patent
was
worth
the
embarrassment
to
the
public
before
granting
it
the
constitution
tells
congress
to
make
only
those
patent
laws
that
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
one
might
imagine
that
this
constitutional
goal
would
guide
courts
in
construing
those
same
laws
yet
neither
jeffersonian
ideals
nor
the
constitutional
text
seem
relevant
to
our
chief
patent
court
when
interpreting
statutory
subject
matter
anything
under
the
sun
made
by
man
is
patentable
subject
matter
and
there
an
end
to
it
the
case
that
announced
the
rule
on
business
methods
involved
a
patent
on
the
process
of
keeping
accounts
in
a
mutual
fund
which
included
multiplying
all
of
the
stock
holdings
of
each
fund
in
a
family
of
funds
by
the
respective
current
share
price
to
get
total
fund
value
and
then
dividing
by
the
number
of
mutual
fund
shares
that
each
customer
actually
holds
to
find
the
balance
in
their
accounts
as
my
son
observed
i
could
do
that
until
nearly
the
end
of
third
grade
in
theory
of
course
if
the
patent
is
not
novel
or
is
obvious
it
will
still
be
refused
the
supreme
court
recently
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
has
made
nonobvious
too
easy
a
standard
to
it
is
unclear
however
whether
that
judgment
will
produce
concrete
effects
on
actual
practices
of
patent
grants
and
litigation
the
patent
and
trademark
office
puts
pressure
on
examiners
to
issue
patents
and
it
is
very
expensive
to
challenge
those
that
are
granted
better
where
possible
to
rule
out
certain
subject
matter
in
the
first
place
tempted
in
part
by
its
flirtation
with
the
idea
made
machine
in
the
context
of
a
computer
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
could
not
bring
itself
to
do
so
where
copyright
law
evolved
to
wall
off
and
minimize
the
dangers
of
extending
protection
over
software
patent
law
actually
extended
the
idea
behind
software
patents
to
make
patentable
any
thought
process
that
might
produce
a
useful
result
once
breached
the
walls
protecting
the
public
domain
in
patent
law
show
a
disturbing
tendency
to
erode
at
an
increasing
rate
to
sum
up
the
conceptual
possibilities
presented
to
copyright
and
patent
law
by
the
idea
of
a
turing
machine
were
fascinating
should
we
extend
copyright
or
patent
to
cover
the
new
technology
the
answer
was
we
will
extend
both
yet
the
results
of
the
extension
were
complex
and
unexpected
in
ways
that
we
will
have
to
understand
if
we
want
to
go
beyond
the
simple
but
important
injunctions
of
jefferson
and
macaulay
who
would
have
predicted
that
software
copyrights
could
be
used
to
create
a
commons
as
well
as
a
monopoly
over
operating
systems
or
that
judges
would
talk
knowingly
of
network
effects
in
curtailing
the
scope
of
coverage
who
would
have
predicted
that
patents
would
be
extended
not
only
to
basic
algorithms
implemented
by
a
computer
but
to
methods
of
business
themselves
truly
a
strange
return
to
legalized
business
monopolies
for
a
country
whose
founders
viewed
them
as
one
of
the
greatest
evils
that
could
be
borne
synthetic
biology
if
you
are
a
reader
of
science
plos
biology
or
nature
you
will
have
noticed
some
attractive
and
bizarre
photographs
recently
a
field
of
bacteria
that
form
themselves
into
eyes
and
polka
dots
a
dim
photograph
of
a
woman
face
taken
by
bacteria
that
have
been
programmed
to
be
sensitive
to
light
you
may
also
have
read
about
more
inspiring
if
less
photogenic
accomplishments
for
example
the
group
of
scientists
who
managed
to
program
bacteria
to
produce
artemesinin
a
scarce
natural
remedy
for
malaria
derived
from
wormwood
poking
deeper
into
these
stories
you
would
have
found
the
phrase
synthetic
biology
repeated
again
and
again
though
a
precise
definition
would
have
eluded
you
what
is
synthetic
biology
for
some
it
is
simply
that
the
product
or
process
involves
biological
materials
not
found
in
nature
good
biotechnology
would
qualify
one
of
the
first
biotechnology
patent
cases
diamond
chakrabarty
involved
some
bacteria
which
chakrabarty
had
engineered
to
eat
oil
slicks
not
their
natural
the
supreme
court
noted
that
the
bacteria
were
not
found
in
nature
and
found
them
to
be
patentable
though
alive
according
to
the
simplest
definition
chakrabarty
process
would
count
as
synthetic
biology
though
this
example
antedates
the
common
use
of
the
term
by
two
decades
for
other
scientists
it
is
the
completely
synthetic
quality
of
the
biology
involved
that
marks
the
edge
of
the
discipline
the
dna
we
are
familiar
with
for
example
has
four
base
pairs
a
c
g
and
scientists
have
developed
genetic
alphabets
that
involve
twelve
base
pairs
not
only
is
the
result
not
found
in
nature
but
the
very
language
in
which
it
is
expressed
is
entirely
new
and
artificial
i
want
to
focus
on
a
third
conception
of
synthetic
biology
the
idea
of
turning
biotechnology
from
an
artisanal
process
of
off
creations
developed
with
customized
techniques
to
a
true
engineering
discipline
using
processes
and
parts
that
are
as
standardized
and
as
well
understood
as
valves
screws
capacitors
or
resistors
the
electrical
engineer
told
to
build
a
circuit
does
not
go
out
and
invent
her
own
switches
or
capacitors
she
can
build
a
circuit
using
components
whose
performance
is
expressed
using
standard
measurements
this
is
the
dream
of
one
group
of
synthetic
biologists
that
biological
engineering
truly
become
engineering
with
biological
black
boxes
that
perform
all
of
the
standard
functions
of
electrical
or
mechanical
engineering
measuring
flow
reacting
to
a
high
signal
by
giving
out
a
low
signal
or
vice
versa
starting
or
terminating
a
sequence
connecting
the
energy
of
one
process
to
another
and
so
on
of
course
an
engineer
understands
the
principle
behind
a
ratchet
or
a
valve
but
he
does
not
have
to
go
through
the
process
of
thinking
as
part
of
this
design
i
will
have
to
create
a
thing
that
lets
stuff
flow
through
one
way
and
not
the
other
the
valve
is
the
mechanical
unit
that
stands
for
that
thought
a
concept
reified
in
standardized
material
form
which
does
not
need
to
be
taken
apart
and
parsed
each
time
it
is
used
by
contrast
the
synthetic
biologists
claim
much
of
current
biotechnological
experimentation
operates
the
way
a
century
artisan
did
think
of
the
gunsmith
making
beautiful
off
classics
for
his
aristocratic
patrons
without
standardized
calibers
parts
or
even
springs
or
screws
the
process
produces
the
gun
but
it
does
not
use
or
produce
standard
parts
that
can
also
be
used
by
the
next
gunsmith
is
this
portrayal
of
biology
correct
does
it
involve
some
hyping
of
the
new
hot
field
some
denigration
of
the
older
techniques
i
would
be
shocked
shocked
to
find
there
was
hype
involved
in
the
scientific
or
academic
enterprise
but
whatever
the
degree
to
which
the
novelty
of
this
process
is
being
subtly
inflated
it
is
hard
to
avoid
being
impressed
by
the
projects
that
this
group
of
synthetic
biologists
has
undertaken
the
mit
registry
of
standard
biological
parts
for
example
has
exactly
the
goal
i
have
just
described
the
development
of
standard
and
interchangeable
biological
parts
is
a
critical
step
towards
the
design
and
construction
of
integrated
biological
systems
the
mit
registry
of
standard
biological
parts
supports
this
goal
by
recording
and
indexing
biological
parts
that
are
currently
being
built
and
offering
synthesis
and
assembly
services
to
construct
new
parts
devices
and
systems
in
the
summer
of
the
registry
contained
about
basic
parts
such
as
operators
protein
coding
regions
and
transcriptional
terminators
and
devices
such
as
logic
gates
built
from
these
basic
parts
today
the
number
of
parts
has
increased
to
about
available
parts
and
defined
parts
the
registry
believes
in
the
idea
that
a
standard
biological
part
should
be
well
specified
and
able
to
be
paired
with
other
parts
into
subassemblies
and
whole
systems
once
the
parameters
of
these
parts
are
determined
and
standardized
simulation
and
design
of
genetic
systems
will
become
easier
and
more
reliable
the
parts
in
the
registry
are
not
simply
segments
of
dna
they
are
functional
using
the
registry
a
group
of
mit
scientists
organizes
an
annual
contest
called
igem
the
international
genetically
engineered
machine
competition
students
can
draw
from
the
standard
parts
that
the
registry
contains
and
perhaps
contribute
their
own
creations
back
to
it
what
kinds
of
genetically
engineered
machines
do
they
build
a
team
of
eight
undergraduates
from
the
university
of
ljubljana
in
slovenia
cheering
and
leaping

in
green
team
won
the
grand
prize
earlier
this
month
at
the
international
genetically
engineered
machine
igem
competition
at
mit
the
group
which
received
an
engraved
award
in
the
shape
of
a
large
aluminum
lego
piece
explored
a
way
to
use
engineered
cells
to
intercept
the
body
excessive
response
to
infection
which
can
lead
to
a
fatal
condition
called
sepsis
the
goal
of
the
students
on
university
teams
from
around
the
world
was
to
build
biological
systems
the
way
a
contractor
would
build
a
house
with
a
toolkit
of
standard
parts
igem
participants
spent
the
summer
immersed
in
the
growing
field
of
synthetic
biology
creating
simple
systems
from
interchangeable
parts
that
operate
in
living
cells
biology
once
thought
too
complicated
to
be
engineered
like
a
clock
computer
or
microwave
oven
has
proven
to
be
open
to
manipulation
at
the
genetic
level
the
new
creations
are
engineered
from
snippets
of
dna
the
molecules
that
run
living
other
igem
entries
have
included
coli
bacteria
that
had
been
engineered
to
smell
like
wintergreen
while
they
were
growing
and
dividing
and
like
bananas
when
they
were
finished
a
biologically
engineered
detector
that
would
change
color
when
exposed
to
unhealthy
levels
of
arsenic
in
drinking
water
a
method
of
programming
mouse
stem
cells
to
differentiate
into
more
specialized
cells
on

and
the
mat
of
bacteria
i
mentioned
earlier
no
matter
how
laudable
the
arsenic
detector
or
the
experimental
technique
dealing
with
sepsis
or
how
cool
the
idea
of
scented
bacteria
this
kind
of
enterprise
will
cause
some
of
you
to
shudder
professor
drew
endy
one
of
the
pioneers
in
this
field
believes
that
part
of
that
reaction
stems
from
simple
novelty
a
lot
of
people
who
were
scaring
folks
in
now
have
nobel
prizes
but
even
if
inchoate
the
concerns
that
synthetic
biology
arouses
stem
from
more
than
novelty
there
is
a
fear
that
if
we
see
the
natural
world
of
biology
as
merely
another
system
that
we
can
routinely
engineer
we
will
have
extended
our
technocratic
methods
into
a
realm
that
was
only
intermittently
subject
to
them
in
a
way
that
threatens
both
our
structure
of
and
our
ecosystem
to
this
the
synthetic
biologists
respond
that
we
are
already
engineering
nature
in
their
view
planned
structured
and
rationalized
genetic
engineering
poses
fewer
dangers
than
poorly
understood
interventions
to
produce
some
specific
result
in
comparative
ignorance
of
the
processes
we
are
employing
to
do
so
if
the
code
is
transparent
subject
to
review
by
a
peer
community
and
based
on
known
parts
and
structures
each
identified
by
a
standard
genetic
barcode
then
the
chance
of
detecting
problems
and
solving
them
is
higher
and
while
the
dangers
are
real
and
not
to
be
minimized
the
potential
benefits
the
lives
saved
because
the
scarce
antimalarial
drug
can
now
be
manufactured
by
energetic
coli
or
because
a
cheap
test
can
demonstrate
arsenic
contamination
in
a
village
well
are
not
to
be
minimized
either
i
first
became
aware
of
synthetic
biology
when
a
number
of
the
scientists
working
on
the
registry
of
standard
biological
parts
contacted
me
and
my
colleague
arti
rai
they
did
not
use
these
exact
words
but
their
question
boiled
down
to
how
does
synthetic
biology
fare
in
intellectual
property
categories
and
how
can
we
keep
the
basics
of
the
science
open
for
all
to
use
as
you
can
tell
from
this
book
i
find
intellectual
property
fascinating
lamentably
so
perhaps
nevertheless
i
was
depressed
by
the
idea
that
scientists
would
have
to
spend
their
valuable
time
trying
to
work
out
how
to
save
their
discipline
from
being
messed
up
by
the
law
surely
it
would
be
better
to
have
them
doing
well
science
they
have
cause
for
concern
as
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
synthetic
biology
shares
characteristics
of
both
software
and
biotechnology
remember
the
focus
on
reducing
functions
to
black
boxes
synthetic
biologists
are
looking
for
the
biological
equivalents
of
switches
valves
and
inverters
the
more
abstractly
these
are
described
the
more
they
come
to
resemble
simple
algebraic
expressions
replete
with
if
then
statements
and
instructions
that
resolve
to
if
x
then
y
if
not
x
then
z
if
this
sounds
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
of
the
turing
machine
it
should
when
the
broad
rules
for
software
and
business
methods
were
enunciated
by
the
federal
courts
software
was
already
a
developed
industry
even
though
the
rules
would
have
allowed
the
equivalent
of
patenting
the
alphabet
the
very
maturity
of
the
field
minimized
the
disruption
such
patents
could
cause
of
course
prior
art
was
not
always
written
down
even
when
it
was
recorded
it
was
sometimes
badly
handled
by
the
examiners
and
the
courts
partly
because
they
set
a
very
undemanding
standard
for
ordinary
expertise
in
the
art
nevertheless
there
was
still
a
lot
of
prior
experience
and
it
rendered
some
of
the
more
basic
claims
incredible
that
is
not
true
in
the
synthetic
biology
field
consider
a
recent
article
in
nature
a
universal
logic
evaluator
that
operates
in
mammalian
cells
the
scientists
describe
their
task
in
terms
that
should
be
familiar
a
molecular
automaton
is
an
engineered
molecular
system
coupled
to
a
bio
molecular
environment
by
of
incoming
messages
and
the
actions
of
outgoing
messages
where
the
incoming
messages
are
processed
by
an
set
of
elements
that
is
a
computer
the
article
goes
on
to
describe
some
of
the
key
elements
of
boolean
algebra
or
and
not
and
so
on
implemented
in
living
mammalian
cells
these
inscriptions
of
boolean
algebra
in
cells
and
dna
sequences
can
be
patented
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
for
example
owns
patent
number
this
invention
relates
to
novel
molecular
constructs
that
act
as
various
logic
elements
gates
and
the
basic
functional
unit
of
the
construct
comprises
a
nucleic
acid
having
at
least
two
protein
binding
sites
that
can
not
be
simultaneously
occupied
by
their
cognate
binding
protein
this
basic
unit
can
be
assembled
in
any
number
of
formats
providing
molecular
constructs
that
act
like
traditional
digital
logic
elements
gates
inverters
my
colleagues
arti
rai
and
sapna
kumar
have
performed
a
patent
search
and
found
many
more
patents
of
similar
what
is
the
concern
after
all
this
is
science
these
seem
like
novel
nonobvious
inventions
with
considerable
utility
the
concern
is
that
the
change
in
the
rules
over
patentable
subject
matter
coupled
with
the
patent
and
trademark
office
handling
of
both
software
and
biotechnology
will
come
together
so
that
the
patent
is
not
over
some
particular
biological
circuit
but
rather
over
boolean
algebra
itself
as
implemented
by
any
biotechnological
means
it
would
be
as
if
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
computer
age
we
had
issued
patents
over
formal
logic
in
software
not
over
a
particular
computer
design
but
over
the
idea
of
a
computer
or
a
binary
circuit
itself
by
means
of
a
computer
was
the
magic
phrase
that
caused
the
walls
around
the
public
domain
of
algorithms
and
ideas
to
crumble
will
by
means
of
a
biological
circuit
do
the
same
and
to
repeat
the
key
point
unlike
computer
science
biotechnology
is
developing
after
the
hypertrophy
of
our
intellectual
property
system
we
do
not
have
the
immune
system
provided
by
the
established
practices
and
norms
the
prior
art
even
the
community
expectations
that
protected
software
from
the
worst
effects
of
patents
over
the
building
blocks
of
science
following
the
example
of
software
the
founders
of
the
mit
registry
of
standard
biological
parts
had
the
idea
of
protecting
their
discipline
from
overly
expansive
intellectual
property
claims
by
turning
those
rights
against
themselves
free
and
open
source
software
developers
have
created
a
commons
using
the
copyright
over
the
code
to
impose
a
license
on
their
software
one
that
requires
subsequent
developers
to
keep
the
source
open
and
to
give
improvements
back
to
the
software
commons
a
virtuous
cycle
could
the
registry
of
standard
biological
parts
do
the
same
thing
the
software
commons
rests
on
a
license
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
last
section
the
license
depends
on
an
underlying
property
right
it
is
because
i
have
automatic
copyright
over
my
code
that
i
can
tell
you
use
it
according
to
these
terms
or
you
will
be
violating
my
copyright
is
there
a
copyright
over
the
products
of
synthetic
biology
to
create
one
we
would
have
to
take
the
extension
of
copyright
that
was
required
to
reach
software
and
stretch
it
even
further
bill
gates
might
argue
for
intellectual
property
rights
over
software
using
the
logic
of
his
article
in
dobb
journal
will
the
argument
for
copyrights
over
synthetic
biological
coding
be
i
need
the
property
right
so
i
can
create
a
commons
in
practice
i
think
the
answer
is
and
should
be
no
of
course
one
could
think
of
this
as
just
another
type
of
coding
making
expressive
choices
in
a
code
of
a
c
g
and
t
just
as
a
programmer
does
in
java
or
c
yet
software
was
already
a
stretch
for
copyright
law
synthetic
biology
strikes
me
as
a
subject
matter
that
the
courts
congress
and
the
copyright
office
are
unlikely
to
want
to
cram
into
already
distorted
outlines
particularly
given
the
obvious
availability
of
patent
rights
as
a
matter
of
conceptual
intuition
i
think
they
will
see
biological
subject
matter
as
harder
to
fit
into
the
categories
of
original
expressive
writing
on
one
level
yes
it
is
all
information
but
on
another
level
the
idea
of
programming
with
gene
sequences
will
probably
raise
hackles
that
the
idea
of
coding
inside
a
programming
language
never
would
as
a
normative
matter
i
think
it
would
be
a
poor
choice
to
apply
copyright
to
the
products
of
synthetic
biology
attempting
to
produce
a
particular
open
commons
one
might
enable
the
kind
of
monopolies
over
functional
objects
that
the
critics
of
software
copyright
initially
feared
if
one
wishes
to
keep
the
basic
ideas
and
techniques
of
synthetic
biology
open
for
subsequent
innovators
there
are
alternatives
to
the
idea
of
a
synthetic
biology
open
source
license
the
registry
of
standard
biological
parts
or
the
biobricks
foundation
can
simply
put
all
their
work
into
the
public
domain
immediately
this
indeed
is
what
they
are
currently
doing
such
a
scheme
lacks
one
key
feature
of
open
source
software
the
right
to
force
subsequent
innovators
to
release
their
code
back
into
the
commons
yet
it
would
make
subsequent
patents
on
the
material
impossible
because
it
had
already
been
published
regardless
of
the
decisions
made
about
the
future
of
synthetic
biology
i
think
its
story
coupled
to
that
of
software
and
biotechnology
more
generally
presents
us
with
an
important
lesson
i
started
the
chapter
with
the
metaphor
of
bed
but
in
the
case
of
software
and
biotechnology
both
the
bed
the
categories
of
copyright
and
patent
and
its
inhabitants
the
new
technologies
were
stretched
cracks
formed
in
the
boundaries
that
were
supposed
to
prevent
copyright
from
being
applied
to
functional
articles
to
prevent
patents
extending
to
cover
ideas
algorithms
and
business
methods
until
this
point
though
the
science
would
have
been
strange
to
jefferson
or
his
contemporaries
the
underlying
issue
would
have
been
familiar
the
scottish
enlightenment
thinkers
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
would
have
scoffed
at
the
idea
that
business
methods
or
algorithms
could
be
patented
let
alone
that
one
could
patent
the
or
and
not
functions
of
boolean
algebra
as
implemented
by
a
biological
mechanism
the
response
presumably
is
to
fine
tune
our
patent
standards
to
patent
the
mousetrap
and
the
corkscrew
not
the
notion
of
catching
mice
or
opening
bottles
by
mechanical
means
still
less
should
we
allow
the
patenting
of
algebra
these
are
fine
points
later
scholarship
has
added
formulae
data
and
historical
analysis
to
back
up
jefferson
concerns
while
never
surpassing
his
prose
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
if
we
were
to
print
out
the
jefferson
warning
and
slip
it
into
the
shirt
pocket
of
every
legislator
and
regulator
our
policy
would
be
remarkably
improved
but
it
is
here
that
the
story
takes
a
new
turn
something
that
neither
jefferson
nor
the
philosophers
of
the
scottish
enlightenment
had
thought
of
something
that
goes
beyond
their
cautions
not
to
confuse
intellectual
property
with
physical
property
to
keep
its
boundaries
scope
and
term
as
small
as
possible
while
still
encouraging
the
desired
innovation
think
of
the
reaction
of
the
synthetic
biologists
at
mit
they
feared
that
the
basic
building
blocks
of
their
new
discipline
could
be
locked
up
slowing
the
progress
of
science
and
research
by
inserting
intellectual
property
rights
at
the
wrong
point
in
the
research
cycle
to
solve
the
problem
they
were
led
seriously
to
consider
claiming
copyright
over
the
products
of
synthetic
biology
to
fight
overly
broad
patent
rights
with
a
privately
constructed
copyright
commons
to
ride
the
process
of
legal
expansion
and
turn
it
to
their
own
ends
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
i
think
the
tactic
would
not
fare
well
in
this
particular
case
but
it
is
an
example
of
a
new
move
in
the
debate
over
intellectual
property
a
new
tactic
the
attempt
to
create
a
privately
constructed
commons
where
the
public
domain
created
by
the
state
does
not
give
you
the
freedom
that
you
believe
creativity
needs
in
order
to
thrive
it
is
to
that
tactic
and
the
distributed
creativity
that
it
enables
that
i
will
turn
to
now
chapter
a

if
you
go

warmly
anticipating
their
rapturous

better
ask
them
first
all
this
copying

sharing
and
printing
sounds
illegal
but
it
is
not
at
least
if
you
went
through
the
steps
i
described
and
the
things
you
can
do
with
this
content
do
not
stop
with
simply
reproducing
it
printing
it
on
paper
or
sending
it
by
much
of
it
can
be
changed
customized
remixed
you
could
rewrite
the
module
of
the
class
and
insert
your
own
illustrations
animate
the
graphs
showing
calculus
in
action
morph
the
photo
into
something
new
if
you
search
for
a
musician
with
the
unpromising
name
brad
sucks
you
will
find
a
web
site
bearing
the
modest
subtitle
a
one
man
band
with
no
fans
brad
it
turns
out
does
not
suck
and
has
many
fans
what
makes
him
particularly
interesting
is
that
he
allows
those
fans
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
to
remix
his
music
and
post
their
creations
online
i
am
particularly
fond
of
the
matterovermind
remix
of
making
me
nervous
but
it
may
not
be
to
your
taste
go
to
a
site
called
ccmixter
and
you
will
find
that
musicians
famous
and
obscure
are
inviting
you
to
sample
and
remix
their
music
or
search
google
for
colin
mutchler
and
listen
to
a
haunting
song
called
my
life
changed
mutchler
and
a
violinist
called
cora
beth
bridges
whom
he
had
never
met
created
that
song
together
he
posted
a
song
called
my
life
online
giving
anyone
the
freedom
to
add
to
it
and
she
did
my
life
changed
on
december
in
san
francisco
a
charitable
organization
called
creative
commons
was
launched
full
disclosure
i
have
been
a
proud
board
member
of
creative
commons
since
its
creation
creative
commons
was
the
brainchild
of
larry
lessig
hal
abelson
and
eric
eldred
all
the
works
i
have
just
described
and
this
book
itself
are
under
creative
commons
licenses
the
authors
and
creators
of
those
works
have
chosen
to
share
it
with
the
world
with
you
under
generous
terms
while
reserving
certain
rights
for
themselves
they
may
have
allowed
you
to
copy
it
but
not
to
alter
it
to
make
derivative
works
or
they
may
have
allowed
you
to
use
it
as
you
wish
so
long
as
you
do
so
noncommercially
or
they
may
have
given
you
complete
freedom
provided
only
that
you
attribute
them
as
the
owner
of
the
work
there
are
a
few
simple
choices
and
a
limited
menu
of
permutations
what
makes
these
licenses
unusual
is
that
they
can
be
read
by
two
groups
that
normal
licenses
exclude
human
beings
rather
than
just
lawyers
and
computers
the
textbooks
photos
films
and
songs
have
a
tasteful
little
emblem
on
them
marked
with
a
cc
which
if
you
click
on
it
links
to
a
commons
deed
a
simple
explanation
of
the
freedoms
you
have
there
are
even
icons
a
dollar
with
a
slash
through
it
for
example
that
make
things
even
clearer
better
still
the
reason
the
search
engines
could
find
this
material
is
that
the
licenses
also
tell
search
engines
exactly
what
freedoms
have
been
given
simple
metadata
a
fancy
word
for
tags
that
computers
can
read
mark
the
material
with
its
particular
level
of
freedoms
this
is
not
digital
rights
management
the
license
will
not
try
to
control
your
computer
install
itself
on
your
hard
drive
or
break
your
tv
it
is
just
an
expression
of
the
terms
under
which
the
author
has
chosen
to
release
the
work
that
means
that
if
you
search
google
or
flickr
for
works
i
am
free
to
share
even
commercially
you
know
you
can
go
into
business
selling
those
textbooks
or
printing
those
photos
on
mugs
and
so
long
as
you
give
the
author
attribution
if
you
search
for
show
me
works
i
can
build
on
you
know
you
are
allowed
to
make
what
copyright
lawyers
call
derivative
works
the
idea
behind
creative
commons
was
simple
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
first
chapter
copyright
adheres
automatically
on
fixation
as
soon
as
you
lift
the
pen
from
the
paper
click
the
shutter
or
save
the
file
the
work
is
copyrighted
no
formalities
no
need
even
to
use
the
little
symbol
c
once
copyrighted
the
work
is
protected
by
the
full
might
of
the
legal
system
and
the
legal
system
default
setting
is
that
all
rights
are
reserved
to
the
author
which
means
effectively
that
anyone
but
the
author
is
forbidden
to
copy
adapt
or
publicly
perform
the
work
this
might
have
been
a
fine
rule
for
a
world
in
which
there
were
high
barriers
to
publication
the
material
that
was
not
published
was
theoretically
under
an
all
rights
reserved
regime
but
who
cared
it
was
practically
inaccessible
anyway
after
the
development
of
the
world
wide
web
all
that
had
changed
suddenly
people
and
institutions
millions
upon
millions
of
them
were
putting
content
online
blogs
photo
sites
videologs
podcasts
course
materials
it
was
all
just
up
there
but
what
could
you
do
with
it
you
could
read
it
or
look
at
it
or
play
it
presumably
otherwise
why
had
the
author
put
it
up
but
could
you
copy
it
put
it
on
your
own
site
include
it
in
a
manual
used
by
the
whole
school
district
it
to
someone
translate
it
into
your
own
language
quote
beyond
the
boundaries
of
fair
use
adapt
for
your
own
purposes
take
the
song
and
use
it
for
your
video
of
course
if
you
really
wanted
the
work
a
lot
you
could
try
to
contact
the
author
not
always
easy
and
one
by
one
we
could
all
contact
each
other
and
ask
for
particular
types
of
permissions
for
use
if
the
use
was
large
enough
or
widespread
enough
perhaps
we
would
even
think
that
an
individual
contract
was
necessary
lawyers
could
be
hired
and
terms
hashed
out
all
this
would
be
fine
if
the
author
wished
to
retain
all
the
rights
that
copyright
gives
and
grant
them
only
individually
for
pay
with
lawyers
in
the
room
but
what
about
the
authors
the
millions
upon
millions
of
writers
and
photographers
and
musicians
and
filmmakers
and
bloggers
and
scholars
who
very
much
want
to
share
their
work
the
cora
beth
bridges
of
the
world
are
never
going
to
write
individual
letters
to
the
colin
mutchlers
of
the
world
asking
for
permission
to
make
a
derivative
work
out
of
my
life
the
person
who
translated
my
articles
into
spanish
or
mandarin
or
the
people
who
repost
them
on
their
web
sites
or
include
them
in
their
anthologies
might
have
asked
permission
if
i
had
not
granted
it
in
advance
i
doubt
though
that
i
would
have
been
contacted
by
the
very
talented
person
who
took
images
from
a
comic
book
about
fair
use
that
i
and
mashed
them
up
with
words
from
a
book
by
larry
lessig
and
some
really
nice
music
from
someone
none
of
us
had
ever
met
without
some
easy
way
to
give
permission
in
advance
and
to
do
so
in
a
way
that
human
beings
and
computers
as
well
as
lawyers
can
understand
those
collaborations
will
never
happen
though
all
the
parties
would
be
delighted
if
they
did
these
are
losses
from
failed
sharing
every
bit
as
real
as
losses
from
unauthorized
copying
but
much
less
in
the
public
eye
creative
commons
was
conceived
as
a
private
hack
to
produce
a
more
copyright
structure
to
replace
all
rights
reserved
with
some
rights
reserved
for
those
who
wished
to
do
so
it
tried
to
do
for
culture
what
the
general
public
license
had
done
for
software
it
made
use
of
the
same
technologies
that
had
created
the
issue
the
technologies
that
made
fixation
of
expressive
content
and
its
distribution
to
the
world
something
that
people
as
well
as
large
concentrations
of
capital
could
do
as
a
result
it
was
able
to
attract
a
surprising
range
of
support
jack
valenti
of
the
motion
picture
association
of
america
and
hillary
rosen
of
the
recording
industry
association
of
america
as
well
as
john
perry
barlow
of
the
grateful
dead
whose
attitude
toward
intellectual
property
was
distinctly
less
favorable
why
could
they
all
agree
these
licenses
were
not
a
choice
forced
on
anyone
the
author
was
choosing
what
to
share
and
under
what
terms
but
that
sharing
created
something
different
something
new
it
was
more
than
a
series
of
isolated
actions
the
result
was
the
creation
of
a
global
commons
of
material
that
was
open
to
all
provided
they
adhered
to
the
terms
of
the
licenses
suddenly
it
was
possible
to
think
of
creating
a
work
entirely
out
of
creative
content
text
photos
movies
music
your
coursebook
on
music
theory
or
your
documentary
on
the
new
york
skyline
could
combine
your
own
original
material
with
text
illustrations
photos
video
and
music
created
by
strangers
one
could
imagine
entire
fields
of
open
educational
content
or
of
open
music
in
which
creators
could
work
without
keeping
one
eye
nervously
on
legal
threats
or
permissions
from
one
perspective
creative
commons
looks
like
a
simple
device
for
enabling
exercise
of
authorial
control
remarkable
only
for
the
extremely
large
number
of
authors
making
that
choice
and
the
simplicity
with
which
they
can
do
so
from
another
it
can
be
seen
as
by
private
choice
and
automated
licenses
the
world
of
creativity
before
law
had
permeated
to
the
finest
most
atomic
level
of
science
and
culture
the
world
of
folk
music
or
jazz
of
jokes
and
slang
and
recipes
of
ray
charles
rewording
of
gospel
songs
or
of
isaac
newton
describing
himself
as
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
and
not
having
to
pay
them
royalties
remember
that
is
not
a
world
without
intellectual
property
the
cookbook
might
be
copyrighted
even
if
the
recipe
was
not
folk
music
makes
it
to
the
popular
scene
and
is
sold
as
a
copyrighted
product
the
jazz
musician
freezes
a
particular
version
of
the
improvisation
on
a
communally
shared
set
of
musical
motifs
records
it
and
sometimes
even
claims
ownership
of
it
newton
himself
was
famously
touchy
about
precedence
and
attribution
even
if
not
about
legal
ownership
of
his
ideas
but
it
is
a
world
in
which
creativity
and
innovation
proceed
on
the
basis
of
an
extremely
large
commons
of
material
into
which
it
was
never
imagined
that
property
rights
could
permeate
for
many
of
us
creative
commons
was
conceived
of
as
a
best
solution
created
by
private
agreement
because
the
best
solution
could
not
be
obtained
through
public
law
the
best
solution
would
be
a
return
of
the
formality
requirement
a
requirement
that
one
at
least
write
the
words
james
boyle
copyright
for
example
in
order
to
get
more
than
years
of
legal
protection
backed
by
strict
liability
and
federal
criminal
law
those
who
did
not
wish
to
have
the
legal
monopoly
could
omit
the
phrase
and
the
work
would
pass
into
the
public
domain
with
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
author
could
claim
copyright
retrospectively
if
the
phrase
was
omitted
by
accident
the
default
position
would
become
freedom
and
the
dead
weight
losses
caused
by
giving
legal
monopolies
to
those
who
had
not
asked
for
them
and
did
not
want
them
would
disappear
to
return
to
the
words
of
justice
brandeis
that
i
quoted
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
the
general
rule
of
law
is
that
the
noblest
of
human
productions
knowledge
truths
ascertained
conceptions
and
ideas
become
after
voluntary
communication
to
others
free
as
the
air
to
common
use
upon
these
incorporeal
productions
the
attribute
of
property
is
continued
after
such
communication
only
in
certain
classes
of
cases
where
public
policy
has
seemed
to
demand
it
brandeis
echoes
the
jeffersonian
preference
for
a
norm
of
freedom
with
narrowly
constrained
exceptions
only
when
necessary
that
preference
means
that
the
commons
of
which
i
spoke
is
a
relatively
large
one
property
rights
are
the
exception
not
the
norm
of
course
many
of
those
who
use
creative
commons
licenses
might
disagree
with
that
policy
preference
and
with
every
idea
in
this
book
they
may
worship
the
dmca
or
just
want
a
way
to
get
their
song
or
their
article
out
there
while
retaining
some
measure
of
control
that
does
not
matter
the
licenses
are
agnostic
like
a
land
trust
which
has
a
local
industrialist
and
a
local
environmentalist
on
its
board
they
permit
us
to
come
to
a
restricted
agreement
on
goals
make
sure
this
space
is
available
to
the
public
even
when
underlying
ideologies
differ
they
do
this
using
those
most
conservative
of
tools
property
rights
and
licenses
and
yet
if
our
vision
of
property
is
sole
and
despotic
dominion
these
licenses
have
created
something
very
different
a
commons
has
been
made
out
of
private
and
exclusive
rights
my
point
here
is
that
creative
commons
licenses
or
the
tools
of
free
and
open
source
software
to
which
i
will
turn
in
a
moment
represent
something
more
than
merely
a
solution
to
a
poorly
chosen
rule
they
represent
a
visible
example
of
a
type
of
creativity
of
innovation
which
has
been
around
for
a
very
long
time
but
which
has
reached
new
salience
on
the
internet
distributed
creativity
based
around
a
shared
commons
of
material
free
and
open
source
software
in
clay
shirky
an
incisive
commentator
on
networked
culture
gave
a
speech
which
anyone
but
a
net
aficionado
might
have
found
simultaneously
romantic
and
impenetrable
he
started
by
telling
the
story
of
a
shinto
shrine
that
has
been
painstakingly
rebuilt
to
exactly
the
same
plan
many
times
over
its
life
and
which
was
denied
certification
as
a
historic
building
as
a
result
shirky
point
what
was
remarkable
was
not
the
building
it
was
a
community
that
would
continue
to
build
and
rebuild
the
thing
for
more
than
a
millennium
from
there
shirky
shifted
to
a
discussion
of
his
attempt
to
get
at
t
to
adopt
the
programming
language
perl
which
is
released
as
free
and
open
source
software
under
the
general
public
license
from
its
initial
creation
by
larry
wall
in
perl
has
been
adapted
modified
and
developed
by
an
extraordinary
range
of
talented
programmers
becoming
more
powerful
and
flexible
in
the
process
as
shirky
recounts
the
story
when
the
at
t
representatives
asked
where
do
you
get
your
support
shirky
responded
get
our
support
from
a
community
which
to
them
sounded
a
bit
like
get
our
thursdays
from
a
banana
shirky
concluded
the
speech
thus
we
have
always
loved
one
another
we
human
something
we
good
at
but
up
until
recently
the
radius
and
of
that
affection
has
been
quite
limited
with
love
alone
you
can
plan
a
birthday
party
add
coordinating
tools
and
you
can
write
an
operating
system
in
the
past
we
would
do
little
things
for
love
but
big
things
required
money
now
we
can
do
big
things
for
there
are
a
few
people
out
there
for
whom
operating
systems
and
love
could
plausibly
coexist
in
a
sentence
not
constructed
by
an
infinite
number
of
monkeys
for
most
though
the
question
is
what
could
he
possibly
have
meant
the
arguments
in
this
book
so
far
have
taken
as
a
given
the
incentives
and
collective
action
problems
to
which
intellectual
property
is
a
response
think
of
chapter
and
the
economic
explanation
of
public
goods
the
fact
that
it
is
expensive
to
do
the
research
to
find
the
right
drug
but
cheap
to
manufacture
it
once
it
is
identified
provides
a
reason
to
create
a
legal
right
of
exclusion
in
those
realms
where
the
innovation
would
not
have
happened
anyway
the
legal
right
of
exclusion
gives
a
power
to
price
above
cost
which
in
turn
gives
incentives
to
creators
and
distributors
so
goes
the
theory
i
have
discussed
the
extent
to
which
the
logic
of
enclosure
works
for
the
commons
of
the
mind
as
well
as
it
did
for
the
arable
commons
taking
into
account
the
effects
of
an
information
society
and
a
global
internet
what
i
have
not
done
is
asked
whether
a
global
network
actually
transforms
some
of
our
assumptions
about
how
creation
happens
in
a
way
that
reshapes
the
debate
about
the
need
for
incentives
at
least
in
certain
areas
this
however
is
exactly
the
question
that
needs
to
be
asked
for
anyone
interested
in
the
way
that
networks
can
enable
new
collaborative
methods
of
production
the
free
software
movement
and
the
broader
but
less
political
movement
that
goes
under
the
name
of
open
source
software
provide
interesting
case
open
source
software
is
released
under
a
series
of
licenses
the
most
important
being
the
general
public
license
gpl
the
gpl
specifies
that
anyone
may
copy
the
software
provided
the
license
remains
attached
and
the
source
code
for
the
software
always
remains
users
may
add
to
or
modify
the
code
may
build
on
it
and
incorporate
it
into
their
own
work
but
if
they
do
so
then
the
new
program
created
is
also
covered
by
the
gpl
some
people
refer
to
this
as
the
viral
nature
of
the
license
others
find
the
term
the
point
however
is
that
the
open
quality
of
the
creative
enterprise
spreads
it
is
not
simply
a
donation
of
a
program
or
a
work
to
the
public
domain
but
a
continual
accretion
in
which
all
gain
the
benefits
of
the
program
on
pain
of
agreeing
to
give
their
additions
and
innovations
back
to
the
communal
project
for
the
whole
structure
to
work
without
centralized
coordination
the
creation
process
has
to
be
modular
with
units
of
different
sizes
and
complexities
each
requiring
slightly
different
expertise
all
of
which
can
be
added
together
to
make
a
grand
whole
i
can
work
on
the
sendmail
program
you
on
the
search
algorithms
more
likely
lots
of
people
try
their
efforts
are
judged
by
the
community
and
the
best
ones
are
adopted
under
these
conditions
this
curious
mix
of
kropotkin
and
adam
smith
richard
dawkins
and
richard
stallman
we
get
distributed
production
without
having
to
rely
on
the
proprietary
exclusion
model
the
whole
enterprise
will
be
much
much
much
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
what
more
and
this
is
a
truly
fascinating
twist
when
the
production
process
does
need
more
centralized
coordination
some
governance
that
guides
how
the
sticky
modular
bits
are
put
together
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
we
can
come
up
with
the
control
system
in
exactly
the
same
way
in
this
sense
distributed
production
is
potentially
recursive
governance
processes
too
can
be
assembled
through
distributed
methods
on
a
global
network
by
people
with
widely
varying
motivations
skills
and
reserve
the
free
and
open
source
software
movements
have
produced
software
that
rivals
or
some
claim
exceeds
the
capabilities
of
conventional
proprietary
its
adoption
on
the
enterprise
level
is
impressive
as
is
the
number
and
enthusiasm
of
the
various
technical
testaments
to
its
strengths
you
have
almost
certainly
used
open
source
software
or
been
its
beneficiary
your
favorite
web
site
or
search
engine
may
run
on
it
if
your
browser
is
firefox
you
use
it
every
day
it
powers
surprising
things
around
you
your
atm
or
your
tivo
the
plane
you
are
flying
in
may
be
running
it
it
just
works
governments
have
taken
notice
the
united
kingdom
for
example
concluded
last
year
that
open
source
software
will
be
considered
alongside
proprietary
software
and
contracts
will
be
awarded
on
a
basis
the
office
of
government
commerce
said
open
source
software
is
a
viable
desktop
alternative
for
the
majority
of
government
users
and
can
generate
significant
savings
these
trials
have
proved
that
open
source
software
is
now
a
real
contender
alongside
proprietary
solutions
if
commercial
companies
and
other
governments
are
taking
it
seriously
then
so
must
we
sweden
found
open
source
software
to
be
in
many
cases
equivalent
to
or
better
than
commercial
products
and
concluded
that
software
procurement
shall
evaluate
open
software
as
well
as
commercial
solutions
to
provide
better
competition
in
the
market
what
is
remarkable
is
not
merely
that
the
software
works
technically
but
that
it
is
an
example
of
widespread
continued
innovation
the
really
remarkable
thing
is
that
it
works
socially
as
a
continuing
system
sustained
by
a
network
consisting
both
of
volunteers
and
of
individuals
employed
by
companies
such
as
ibm
and
google
whose
software
output
is
nevertheless
released
into
the
commons
here
it
seems
we
have
a
classic
public
good
code
that
can
be
copied
freely
and
sold
or
redistributed
without
paying
the
creator
or
creators
this
sounds
like
a
tragedy
of
the
commons
of
the
kind
that
i
described
in
the
first
three
chapters
of
the
book
obviously
with
a
nonrival
nonexcludable
good
like
software
this
method
of
production
can
not
be
sustained
there
are
inadequate
incentives
to
ensure
continued
production
e
pur
si
muove
as
galileo
is
apocryphally
supposed
to
have
said
in
the
face
of
cardinal
bellarmine
certainties
and
yet
it
moves
or
as
clay
shirky
put
it
we
get
our
support
from
a
community
for
a
fair
amount
of
time
most
economists
looked
at
open
source
software
and
threw
up
their
hands
from
their
point
of
view
we
get
our
support
from
a
community
did
indeed
sound
like
we
get
our
thursdays
from
a
banana
there
is
an
old
economics
joke
about
the
impossibility
of
finding
a
bill
lying
on
a
sidewalk
in
an
efficient
market
the
money
would
already
have
been
picked
up
do
not
wait
for
a
punch
line
when
economists
looked
at
open
source
software
they
saw
not
a
single
dollar
bill
lying
implausibly
on
the
sidewalk
but
whole
bushels
of
them
why
would
anyone
work
on
a
project
the
fruits
of
which
could
be
appropriated
by
anyone
since
copyright
adheres
on
fixation
since
the
computer
programmer
already
has
the
legal
power
to
exclude
others
why
would
he
or
she
choose
to
take
the
extra
step
of
adopting
a
license
that
undermined
that
exclusion
why
would
anyone
choose
to
allow
others
to
use
and
modify
the
results
of
their
hard
work
why
would
they
care
whether
the
newcomers
in
turn
released
their
contributions
back
into
the
commons
the
puzzles
went
beyond
the
motivations
of
the
people
engaging
in
this
particular
form
of
distributed
creativity
how
could
these
implausible
contributions
be
organized
how
should
we
understand
this
strange
form
of
organization
it
is
not
a
company
or
a
government
bureaucracy
what
could
it
be
to
richard
epstein
the
answer
was
obvious
and
pointed
to
a
reason
the
experiment
must
inevitably
end
in
failure
the
open
source
movement
shares
many
features
with
a
workers
commune
and
is
likely
to
fail
for
the
same
reason
it
can
not
scale
up
to
meet
its
own
successes
to
see
the
difficulty
imagine
a
commune
entirely
owned
by
its
original
workers
who
share
pro
rata
in
its
increases
in
value
the
system
might
work
well
in
the
early
days
when
the
workforce
remains
fixed
but
what
happens
when
a
given
worker
wants
to
quit
does
that
worker
receive
in
cash
or
kind
his
share
of
the
gain
in
value
during
the
period
of
his
employment
if
not
then
the
up
in
value
during
his
period
of
employment
will
be
gobbled
up
by
his
successor
a
recipe
for
immense
resentment
yet
that
danger
can
be
ducked
only
by
creating
a
capital
structure
that
gives
present
employees
separable
interests
in
either
debt
or
equity
in
exchange
for
their
contributions
to
the
company
but
once
that
is
done
then
the
worker
commune
is
converted
into
a
traditional
company
whose
shareholders
and
creditors
contain
a
large
fraction
of
its
present
and
former
employers
the
bottom
line
is
that
idealistic
communes
can
not
last
for
the
long
there
are
a
number
of
ideas
here
first
idealistic
communes
can
not
last
for
the
long
haul
the
skepticism
about
the
staying
power
of
idealism
sounds
plausible
today
though
there
are
some
relatively
prominent
counterexamples
the
catholic
church
is
also
a
purportedly
idealistic
institution
it
is
based
on
canonical
texts
that
are
subject
to
even
more
heated
arguments
about
textual
interpretation
than
those
which
surround
the
general
public
license
it
seems
to
be
surviving
the
long
haul
quite
well
the
second
reason
for
doomsaying
is
provided
by
the
word
commune
the
problems
epstein
describes
are
real
where
tangible
property
and
excludable
assets
are
involved
but
is
the
free
and
open
source
community
a
commune
holding
tangible
property
in
common
and
excluding
the
rest
of
us
must
it
worry
about
how
to
split
up
the
proceeds
if
someone
leaves
because
of
bad
karma
or
is
it
a
community
creating
and
offering
to
the
world
the
ability
to
use
for
free
nonrival
goods
that
all
of
us
can
have
use
and
reinterpret
as
we
wish
in
that
kind
of
commune
each
of
us
could
take
all
the
property
the
community
had
created
with
us
when
we
left
and
the
commune
would
still
be
none
the
poorer
jefferson
was
not
thinking
of
software
when
he
talked
of
the
person
who
lights
his
taper
from
mine
but
does
not
darken
me
but
the
idea
is
the
same
one
copying
software
is
not
like
fighting
over
who
owns
the
scented
candles
or
the
vw
bus
does
the
person
who
wrote
the
kernel
of
the
operating
system
resent
the
person
who
much
later
writes
the
code
to
manage
internet
protocol
addresses
on
a
wireless
network
why
should
he
now
the
program
does
more
cool
stuff
both
of
them
can
use
it
what
to
resent
how
about
idealism
there
is
indeed
a
broad
debate
on
the
reasons
that
the
system
works
are
the
motivations
those
of
the
gift
economy
is
it
as
shirky
says
simply
the
flowering
of
an
innate
love
that
human
beings
have
always
had
for
each
other
and
for
sharing
now
given
new
strength
by
the
geographic
reach
and
cooperative
techniques
the
internet
provides
with
love
alone
you
can
plan
a
birthday
party
add
coordinating
tools
and
you
can
write
an
operating
system
is
this
actually
a
form
of
potlatch
in
which
one
gains
prestige
by
the
extravagance
of
the
resources
one
wastes
is
open
source
an
implicit
builder
that
pays
off
in
other
ways
is
it
driven
by
the
the
innate
human
love
of
creation
that
continually
drives
us
to
create
new
things
even
when
homo
economicus
would
be
at
home
in
bed
mumbling
about
public
goods
problems
yochai
benkler
and
i
would
argue
that
these
questions
are
fun
to
debate
but
ultimately
assume
a
random
distribution
of
incentive
structures
in
different
people
a
global
network
transmission
information
sharing
and
copying
costs
that
approach
zero
and
a
modular
creation
process
with
these
assumptions
it
just
does
not
matter
why
they
do
it
in
lots
of
cases
they
will
do
it
one
person
works
for
love
of
the
species
another
in
the
hope
of
a
better
job
a
third
for
the
joy
of
solving
puzzles
and
a
fourth
because
he
has
to
solve
a
particular
problem
anyway
for
his
own
job
and
loses
nothing
by
making
his
hack
available
for
all
each
person
has
their
own
reserve
price
the
point
at
which
they
say
now
i
will
turn
off
survivor
and
go
and
create
something
but
on
a
global
network
there
are
a
lot
of
people
and
with
numbers
that
big
and
information
overhead
that
small
even
relatively
hard
projects
will
attract
motivated
and
skilled
people
whose
particular
reserve
price
has
been
crossed
more
conventionally
many
people
write
free
software
because
they
are
paid
to
do
so
amazingly
ibm
now
earns
more
from
what
it
calls
revenues
than
it
does
from
traditional
patent
licensing
and
ibm
is
the
largest
patent
holder
in
the
it
has
decided
that
the
availability
of
an
open
platform
to
which
many
firms
and
individuals
contribute
will
actually
allow
it
to
sell
more
of
its
services
and
for
that
matter
its
hardware
a
large
group
of
other
companies
seem
to
agree
they
like
the
idea
of
basing
their
services
hardware
and
added
value
on
a
widely
adopted
commons
this
does
not
seem
like
a
community
in
decline
people
used
to
say
that
collaborative
creation
could
never
produce
a
quality
product
that
has
been
shown
to
be
false
so
now
they
say
that
collaborative
creation
can
not
be
sustained
because
the
governance
mechanisms
will
not
survive
the
success
of
the
project
professor
epstein
conjures
up
a
central
committee
from
which
insiders
will
be
unable
to
cash
out
a
nice
mixture
of
communist
and
capitalist
metaphors
all
governance
systems
including
democracies
and
corporate
boards
have
problems
but
so
far
as
we
can
tell
those
who
are
influential
in
the
free
software
and
open
source
governance
communities
there
is
alas
no
central
committee
feel
that
they
are
doing
very
well
indeed
in
the
last
resort
when
they
disagree
with
decisions
that
are
taken
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
forking
the
code
introducing
a
change
to
the
software
that
not
everyone
agrees
with
and
then
letting
free
choice
and
market
selection
converge
on
the
preferred
iteration
the
free
software
ecosystem
also
exhibits
diversity
systems
based
on
for
example
have
distinct
flavors
with
names
like
ubuntu
debian
and
slackware
each
with
passionate
adherents
and
each
optimized
for
a
particular
concern
beauty
ease
of
use
technical
manipulability
so
far
the
tradition
of
rough
consensus
and
running
code
seems
to
be
proving
itself
empirically
as
a
robust
governance
system
why
on
earth
should
we
care
people
have
come
up
with
a
surprising
way
to
create
software
so
what
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
we
might
care
first
it
teaches
us
something
about
the
limitations
of
conventional
economics
and
the
counterintuitive
business
methods
that
thrive
on
networks
second
it
might
offer
a
new
tool
in
our
attempt
to
solve
a
variety
of
social
problems
third
and
most
speculative
it
hints
at
the
way
that
a
global
communications
network
can
sometimes
help
move
the
line
between
work
and
play
professional
and
amateur
individual
and
community
creation
rote
production
and
compensated
hobby
we
should
pay
attention
to
open
source
software
because
it
shows
us
something
about
business
methods
in
the
digital
world
indeed
in
the
entire
world
of
products
which
is
coming
to
include
biotechnology
the
scale
of
your
network
matters
the
larger
the
number
of
people
who
use
your
operating
system
make
programs
for
your
type
of
computer
create
new
levels
for
your
game
or
use
your
device
the
better
off
you
are
a
single
fax
machine
is
a
paperweight
two
make
up
a
communications
link
ten
million
and
you
have
a
ubiquitous
communications
network
into
which
your
paperweight
is
now
a
hugely
valuable
doorway
this
is
the
strange
characteristic
of
networked
goods
the
actions
of
strangers
dramatically
increase
or
decrease
the
usefulness
of
your
good
at
each
stage
the
decision
of
someone
else
to
buy
a
fax
machine
increases
the
value
of
mine
if
i
am
eating
an
apple
i
am
indifferent
about
whether
you
are
too
but
if
i
have
a
fax
machine
then
my
welfare
is
actually
improved
by
the
decisions
of
strangers
to
buy
one
the
same
process
works
in
reverse
buy
a
word
processing
program
that
becomes
unpopular
get
locked
in
to
using
it
and
find
yourself
unable
to
exchange
your
work
easily
with
others
networks
matter
and
increasing
the
size
of
the
networks
continues
to
add
benefits
to
the
individual
members
what
true
for
the
users
of
networks
is
doubly
so
for
the
producers
of
the
goods
that
create
them
from
the
perspective
of
a
producer
of
a
good
that
shows
strong
network
effects
such
as
a
word
processing
program
or
an
operating
system
the
optimal
position
is
to
be
the
company
that
owns
and
controls
the
dominant
product
on
the
market
the
ownership
and
control
is
probably
by
means
of
intellectual
property
rights
which
are
after
all
the
type
of
property
rights
one
finds
on
networks
the
value
of
that
property
depends
on
those
positive
and
negative
network
effects
this
is
the
reason
microsoft
is
worth
so
much
money
the
immense
investment
in
time
familiarity
legacy
documents
and
training
that
windows
or
word
users
have
provides
a
strong
incentive
not
to
change
products
the
fact
that
other
users
are
similarly
constrained
makes
it
difficult
to
manage
any
change
even
if
i
change
word
processor
formats
and
go
through
the
trouble
to
convert
all
my
documents
i
still
need
to
exchange
files
with
you
who
are
similarly
constrained
from
a
monopolist
point
of
view
the
handcuffs
of
network
effects
are
indeed
golden
though
opinions
differ
about
whether
or
not
this
is
a
cause
for
antitrust
action
but
if
the
position
that
yields
the
most
revenue
is
that
of
a
monopolist
exercising
total
control
the
position
may
well
be
that
of
a
company
contributing
to
a
large
and
widely
used
network
based
on
open
standards
and
perhaps
open
software
the
companies
that
contribute
to
open
source
do
not
have
the
ability
to
exercise
monopoly
control
the
right
to
extract
every
last
cent
of
value
from
it
but
they
do
have
a
different
advantage
they
get
the
benefit
of
all
the
contributions
to
the
system
without
having
to
pay
for
them
the
person
who
improves
an
open
source
program
may
not
work
for
ibm
or
red
hat
but
those
companies
benefit
from
her
addition
just
as
she
does
from
theirs
the
system
is
designed
to
continue
growing
adding
more
contributions
back
into
the
commons
the
users
get
the
benefit
of
an
network
while
the
openness
of
the
material
diminishes
the
effects
lacking
the
ability
to
extract
payment
for
the
network
good
itself
the
operating
system
say
the
companies
that
participate
typically
get
paid
for
providing
tied
goods
and
services
the
value
of
which
increases
as
the
network
does
i
write
a
column
for
the
financial
times
but
i
lack
the
fervor
of
the
true
enthusiast
in
the
great
game
of
markets
by
themselves
counterintuitive
business
methods
do
not
make
my
antennae
tingle
but
as
larry
lessig
and
yochai
benkler
have
argued
this
is
something
more
than
just
another
business
method
they
point
us
to
the
dramatic
role
that
openness
whether
in
network
architecture
software
or
content
has
had
in
the
success
of
the
internet
what
is
going
on
here
is
actually
a
remarkable
corrective
to
the
simplistic
notion
of
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
a
corrective
to
the
internet
threat
storyline
and
to
the
dynamics
of
the
second
enclosure
movement
this
commons
creates
and
sustains
value
and
allows
firms
and
individuals
to
benefit
from
it
without
depleting
the
value
already
created
to
appropriate
a
phrase
from
carol
rose
open
source
teaches
us
about
the
comedy
of
the
commons
a
way
of
arranging
markets
and
production
that
we
with
our
experience
rooted
in
physical
property
and
its
typical
characteristics
at
first
find
counterintuitive
and
bizarre
which
brings
us
to
the
next
question
for
open
source
can
we
use
its
techniques
to
solve
problems
beyond
the
world
of
software
production
in
the
language
of
computer
programmers
the
issue
here
is
does
it
scale
can
we
generalize
anything
from
this
limited
example
how
many
types
of
production
innovation
and
research
fit
into
the
model
i
have
just
described
after
all
for
many
innovations
and
inventions
one
needs
hardware
capital
investment
and
data
collection
stuff
in
its
infinite
recalcitrance
and
facticity
maybe
the
open
source
model
provides
a
workaround
to
the
individual
incentives
problem
but
that
is
not
the
only
problem
and
how
many
types
of
innovation
or
cultural
production
are
as
modular
as
software
is
open
source
software
a
paradigm
case
of
collective
innovation
that
helps
us
to
understand
open
source
software
and
not
much
else
again
i
think
this
is
a
good
question
but
it
may
be
the
wrong
one
my
own
guess
is
that
an
open
source
method
of
production
is
far
more
common
than
we
realize
even
before
the
internet
as
some
of
my
students
have
taken
to
saying
portentously
science
law
education
and
musical
genres
all
developed
in
ways
that
are
markedly
similar
to
the
model
i
have
described
the
marketplace
of
ideas
the
continuous
roiling
development
in
thought
and
norms
that
our
political
culture
spawns
owes
much
more
to
the
distributed
nonproprietary
model
than
it
does
to
the
special
case
of
commodified
innovation
that
we
think
about
in
copyright
and
patent
not
that
copyright
and
patent
are
unimportant
in
the
process
but
they
may
well
be
the
exception
rather
than
the
norm
production
of
ideas
is
hardly
unfamiliar
after
all
in
fact
all
the
mottos
of
free
software
development
have
their
counterparts
in
the
theory
of
democracy
and
open
society
given
enough
eyeballs
all
bugs
are
shallow
is
merely
the
most
obvious
example
karl
popper
would
have
the
importance
of
open
source
software
is
not
that
it
introduces
us
to
a
wholly
new
idea
it
is
that
it
makes
us
see
clearly
a
very
old
idea
with
open
source
the
technology
was
novel
the
production
process
transparent
and
the
result
of
that
process
was
a
product
which
outcompeted
other
products
in
the
marketplace
how
can
this
have
happened
what
about
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
we
asked
in
puzzlement
coming
only
slowly
to
the
realization
that
other
examples
of
nonproprietary
production
were
all
around
us
still
this
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
model
can
scale
still
further
whether
it
can
be
applied
to
solve
problems
in
other
spheres
to
answer
that
question
we
would
need
to
think
more
about
the
modularity
of
other
types
of
inventions
how
much
can
they
be
broken
down
into
chunks
suitable
for
distribution
among
a
widespread
community
which
forms
of
innovation
have
some
irreducible
need
for
high
capital
investment
in
distinctly
nonvirtual
components
a
particle
accelerator
or
a
phase
iii
drug
trial
again
my
guess
is
that
the
increasing
migration
of
the
sciences
toward
and
models
makes
much
more
of
innovation
and
discovery
a
potential
candidate
for
the
distributed
model
bioinformatics
and
computational
biology
the
open
source
genomics
the
biobricks
foundation
i
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
the
possibility
of
distributed
data
scrutiny
by
lay
all
of
these
offer
intriguing
glances
into
the
potential
for
the
future
finally
of
course
the
internet
is
one
big
experiment
in
as
benkler
puts
it
cultural
if
these
questions
are
good
ones
why
are
they
also
the
wrong
ones
i
have
given
my
guesses
about
the
future
of
the
distributed
model
of
innovation
my
own
utopia
has
it
flourishing
alongside
a
but
still
powerful
intellectual
property
regime
equally
plausible
scenarios
see
it
as
a
dead
end
or
as
the
inevitable
victor
in
the
war
of
productive
processes
these
are
all
guesses
however
at
the
very
least
there
is
some
possibility
even
hope
that
we
could
have
a
world
in
which
much
more
of
intellectual
and
inventive
production
is
as
in
speech
richard
stallman
says
not
free
as
in
beer
but
we
could
hope
that
much
of
it
would
be
both
free
of
centralized
control
and
or
when
the
marginal
cost
of
reproduction
is
zero
the
marginal
cost
of
transmission
and
storage
approaches
zero
the
process
of
creation
is
additive
and
much
of
the
labor
does
charge
the
world
looks
a
little
this
is
at
least
a
possible
future
or
part
of
a
possible
future
and
one
that
we
should
not
foreclose
without
thinking
twice
yet
that
is
what
we
are
doing
the
database
protection
bills
and
directives
which
extend
intellectual
property
rights
to
the
layer
of
facts
the
efflorescence
of
software
patents
the
validation
of
shrinkwrap
licenses
that
bind
third
parties
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
anticircumvention
the
point
of
all
of
these
developments
is
not
merely
that
they
make
the
model
difficult
but
that
in
many
cases
they
rule
it
out
altogether
i
will
assert
this
point
here
rather
than
argue
for
it
but
i
think
it
can
be
and
has
been
demonstrated
quite
the
point
is
then
that
there
is
a
chance
that
a
new
or
old
but
underrecognized
method
of
production
could
flourish
in
ways
that
seem
truly
valuable
valuable
to
free
speech
innovation
scientific
discovery
the
wallets
of
consumers
to
what
william
fisher
calls
semiotic
democracy
and
perhaps
valuable
to
the
balance
between
joyful
creation
and
drudgery
for
hire
true
it
is
only
a
chance
true
this
theory
scope
of
operation
and
sustainability
are
uncertain
but
why
would
we
want
to
foreclose
it
that
is
what
the
recent
expansions
of
intellectual
property
threaten
to
do
and
remember
these
expansions
were
dubious
even
in
a
world
where
we
saw
little
or
no
possibility
of
the
distributed
production
model
i
have
described
where
discussion
of
network
effects
had
yet
to
reach
the
pages
of
the
new
and
where
our
concerns
about
the
excesses
of
intellectual
property
were
simply
the
ones
that
jefferson
madison
and
macaulay
gave
us
so
long
ago
learning
from
the
sharing
economy
accept
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
free
software
community
actually
works
actually
produces
products
capable
of
competing
in
the
market
with
proprietary
alternatives
concede
for
a
moment
that
the
adoption
of
creative
commons
licenses
shows
there
are
millions
of
creators
out
there
who
want
to
share
their
works
with
others
many
of
those
creators
even
want
to
allow
the
world
to
build
on
their
material
indeed
let
us
concede
that
the
whole
history
of
the
web
from
wikipedia
to
the
obsessive
and
usefully
detailed
sites
created
on
everything
from
vikings
to
shoe
polishes
shows
a
desire
to
share
knowledge
to
build
on
the
work
of
others
one
has
never
met
these
efforts
are
remarkably
varied
some
are
ultimately
aimed
at
profit
even
if
their
results
are
free
think
of
ibm
open
source
initiatives
or
musicians
who
release
creative
licensed
work
in
order
to
get
more
club
gigs
some
are
provided
as
a
volunteer
act
of
benevolence
or
civic
duty
even
if
they
compete
with
expensive
proprietary
alternatives
think
of
wikipedia
or
mit
opencourseware
when
the
infrastructure
for
this
collaboration
does
not
exist
it
gets
assembled
and
quickly
both
the
gpl
and
creative
commons
are
examples
accept
all
of
this
so
what
lesson
number
one
comes
from
the
nonprofit
activities
everything
from
wikipedia
to
web
sites
created
by
enthusiasts
people
like
to
create
and
wish
to
share
in
many
cases
they
will
do
so
without
financial
reward
a
surprising
amount
of
useful
creative
or
expressive
activity
is
generated
without
any
financial
incentive
at
all
should
this
cause
us
to
throw
out
the
economic
case
for
copyrights
no
but
it
should
lead
us
to
reassess
it
as
i
explained
in
chapter
copyright
provides
an
incentive
for
two
distinct
activities
first
it
offers
an
incentive
to
create
the
work
in
the
first
place
the
author
of
windows
for
dummies
or
harry
potter
gets
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
copying
the
work
a
right
that
he
or
she
can
sell
in
the
marketplace
the
goal
is
to
offer
a
financial
reason
to
devote
time
to
this
particular
creative
activity
it
is
this
incentive
that
is
most
often
cited
when
attempting
to
persuade
policy
makers
to
expand
protection
second
it
offers
an
incentive
to
distribute
the
work
to
typeset
and
print
large
quantities
of
the
work
and
to
sell
it
to
bookstores
or
to
broadcast
it
or
put
it
on
movie
screens
each
medium
is
economically
different
of
course
the
economics
of
the
feature
film
are
different
from
those
of
the
book
the
magazine
or
the
operating
system
thus
we
have
never
had
very
good
figures
on
the
relative
importance
of
these
incentives
we
can
only
guess
at
how
much
of
the
incentive
from
copyright
goes
to
encouraging
creation
and
how
much
to
distribution
until
recently
most
types
of
distribution
demanded
higher
levels
of
capital
the
industry
structure
that
resulted
often
consisted
of
creators
who
worked
as
wage
or
contract
labor
for
distributors
either
never
acquiring
copyright
in
their
work
in
the
first
place
or
immediately
transferring
that
copyright
to
their
employers
because
distribution
was
expensive
our
experience
with
material
generated
for
fun
or
out
of
a
love
of
sharing
was
an
essentially
private
and
local
one
you
might
have
a
neighbor
photocopied
sheet
of
baking
recipes
that
worked
well
at
high
altitudes
or
of
fishing
techniques
that
worked
well
on
a
particular
lake
a
song
that
a
friend
created
for
a
special
occasion
or
a
short
story
you
wrote
for
your
kids
and
then
typed
up
for
them
to
tell
to
theirs
financial
incentives
were
not
needed
to
encourage
the
creation
of
the
work
but
the
cost
of
distribution
dramatically
limited
its
dissemination
the
single
most
dramatic
thing
that
the
web
has
done
by
lowering
the
cost
of
communication
and
distribution
at
the
same
moment
that
other
electronic
tools
lowered
the
cost
of
production
is
to
make
this
local
and
private
activity
a
global
and
public
one
someone
somewhere
will
have
written
the
guide
to
fishing
on
that
lake
baking
at
that
altitude
washing
windows
or
treating
stings
from
portuguese
jellyfish
someone
will
have
taken
a
photo
of
the
duke
chapel
or
explained
the
history
economics
and
chemistry
of
shoe
polish
or
distilling
someone
might
even
have
created
a
great
class
on
music
theory
or
c
programming
someone
will
have
written
a
handy
little
program
to
manage
dns
requests
on
a
local
network
bizarrely
at
least
as
far
as
the
economists
were
concerned
these
people
all
wanted
to
share
what
they
had
made
because
of
the
genius
of
search
engines
and
the
implicit
function
that
those
engines
deduce
from
patterns
of
links
to
pages
i
can
find
that
material
when
i
need
it
true
much
of
the
material
on
the
web
is
inane
or
insane
confused
badly
written
tendentious
and
inaccurate
it
should
be
noted
that
this
is
hardly
a
problem
confined
to
the
web
or
material
personally
i
would
not
want
people
magazine
or
fox
news
in
a
time
capsule
to
represent
my
civilization
but
some
of
the
material
on
the
web
is
clearly
worse
yes
wikipedia
is
occasionally
inaccurate
though
in
one
test
in
nature
it
stacked
up
well
against
the
encyclopedia
britannica
and
it
is
obviously
much
more
encyclopedic
in
its
coverage
but
all
of
this
misses
the
point
consider
how
your
expectations
about
information
retrieval
have
changed
in
the
last
fifteen
years
we
now
simply
assume
that
questions
about
a
piece
of
architecture
a
bit
of
local
history
a
recipe
or
the
true
author
of
a
song
can
all
be
answered
within
seconds
we
have
forgotten
what
it
is
like
to
be
routinely
in
ignorance
because
of
the
unavailability
of
some
piece
of
information
one
podcaster
i
talked
to
called
it
being
a
member
of
the
generation
when
i
am
walking
around
and
i
see
a
building
i
almost
feel
as
though
i
ought
to
be
able
to
click
it
and
have
the
architect
name
pop
up
consider
that
it
now
seems
normal
for
a
gay
iraqi
man
in
baghdad
to
have
a
blog
that
offers
hundreds
of
thousands
of
readers
around
the
world
a
literate
and
touching
account
of
the
american
occupation
from
a
perspective
entirely
different
from
that
provided
by
the
mainstream
we
think
it
normal
for
a
person
of
moderate
resources
to
be
able
to
speak
to
the
world
from
a
war
zone
whether
or
not
he
is
affiliated
with
a
newspaper
or
credentialed
by
a
corporation
these
examples
are
not
the
end
of
the
process
our
methods
of
sorting
ranking
and
verifying
the
material
generated
are
still
evolving
they
may
improve
even
beyond
this
point
we
are
only
fifteen
years
into
this
particular
experiment
after
all
and
a
huge
amount
of
this
material
is
produced
by
our
fellow
citizens
without
the
profit
motive
does
this
mean
that
we
no
longer
need
copyright
or
patent
protection
to
encourage
the
production
and
distribution
of
creative
work
no
the
fishing
tips
are
great
but
i
still
might
buy
a
handsomely
illustrated
guide
to
take
on
the
lake
with
me
or
even
better
just
stay
at
home
and
read
a
river
runs
through
it
the
new
yorker
and
not
a
sheaf
of
printouts
from
the
web
still
sits
on
my
coffee
table
though
much
of
the
content
i
read
comes
to
me
online
for
free
from
strangers
who
are
generating
it
for
pleasure
not
profit
or
who
profit
from
open
sharing
not
closed
control
the
online
blogosphere
provides
a
vital
counterpoint
to
mainstream
media
but
it
exists
in
a
symbiotic
some
would
say
parasitic
relationship
with
that
media
and
the
network
of
professional
news
gatherers
for
which
it
pays
some
of
the
most
interesting
open
source
production
methods
actually
rely
on
copyright
even
if
they
did
not
open
source
production
would
not
suffice
to
run
our
pharmaceutical
industry
though
it
might
help
with
certain
stages
of
the
drug
discovery
process
still
just
as
it
would
be
silly
to
dismiss
the
importance
of
intellectual
property
based
on
our
experience
of
blogs
and
wikipedia
and
open
source
software
it
would
be
equally
silly
to
underestimate
what
the
web
has
taught
us
the
web
has
enabled
an
astonishing
flowering
of
communication
and
expression
an
astounding
democratization
of
creativity
we
have
learned
just
how
strong
and
how
useful
is
the
human
urge
to
express
communicate
invent
and
create
provided
the
barriers
to
sharing
are
lowered
these
are
the
very
things
that
copyright
and
patent
are
supposed
to
encourage
for
us
to
portray
the
web
as
the
internet
threat
story
line
does
as
predominantly
a
threat
to
creativity
is
simply
perverse
for
us
to
base
our
policies
only
on
that
notion
would
be
a
tragedy
we
might
end
up
stultifying
one
of
the
greatest
explosions
of
human
creativity
the
world
has
ever
seen
by
treating
it
as
an
unimportant
marginal
case
and
instead
designing
our
rules
around
the
production
processes
of
commercial
culture
in
the
late
twentieth
century
the
shape
of
our
copyright
and
to
a
lesser
extent
our
patent
system
comes
from
a
world
in
which
almost
all
distribution
was
an
expensive
enterprise
the
roles
of
gatekeeper
and
financier
producer
and
assembler
distributor
and
advertiser
tended
naturally
to
coalesce
into
vertically
integrated
firms
or
symbiotic
commercial
partnerships
those
firms
were
presumed
to
be
the
proxy
for
the
public
interest
when
it
came
to
intellectual
property
policy
who
would
know
better
than
they
what
was
needed
occasionally
device
manufacturers
would
provide
a
counterweight
as
in
the
sony
case
where
the
defense
of
a
particular
consumer
freedom
actually
created
a
market
for
a
complementary
product
artists
and
authors
might
be
trotted
out
as
appealing
spokespersons
though
the
laws
that
were
made
only
sporadically
reflected
their
economic
and
artistic
interests
librarians
and
educational
institutions
had
influence
at
the
edges
most
of
the
time
though
it
was
the
assemblers
and
distributors
of
content
whose
voices
and
assumptions
about
markets
would
be
heard
out
of
this
pattern
of
habit
and
influence
and
out
of
much
deeper
notions
about
authorship
and
invention
that
i
have
explored
elsewhere
developed
an
ideology
a
worldview
call
it
maximalism
its
proponents
sincerely
believed
in
it
and
pursued
it
even
when
it
did
not
make
economic
sense
think
how
lucky
the
movie
industry
is
that
it
lost
the
sony
case
it
has
been
the
subject
of
this
book
its
tenets
are
that
intellectual
property
is
just
like
physical
property
that
rights
need
to
increase
proportionately
as
copying
costs
decrease
and
that
in
general
increasing
levels
of
intellectual
property
protection
will
yield
increasing
levels
of
innovation
despite
its
defense
of
monopolies
this
ideology
cloaks
itself
in
the
rhetoric
of
free
markets
the
bumbling
state
whose
interventions
in
the
economy
normally
spell
disaster
turns
into
a
genius
when
its
monopolies
and
subsidies
are
provided
through
intellectual
property
rights
rather
than
regulatory
fiat
above
all
this
way
of
seeing
the
world
minimizes
the
importance
of
creativity
expression
and
distribution
that
takes
place
outside
its
framework
and
ignores
or
plays
down
the
importance
of
the
input
side
of
the
equation
the
need
to
focus
on
the
material
from
which
culture
and
science
are
made
as
well
as
the
protected
expression
and
inventions
made
from
that
raw
material
this
process
was
not
let
me
stress
was
not
a
simple
process
of
economic
determinism
or
industry
conspiracy
anyone
who
claims
that
is
the
thesis
of
this
book
simply
has
not
read
it
reviewers
beware
let
us
start
with
economic
determinism
it
was
not
a
situation
in
which
the
law
mechanistically
recorded
the
interests
of
the
most
economically
important
industries
in
the
area
this
was
the
creation
of
a
worldview
not
the
eyed
calculation
of
profit
and
loss
not
only
did
many
of
the
rules
we
ended
up
with
make
no
sense
from
the
point
of
view
of
some
of
the
largest
economic
players
in
the
area
think
of
the
device
manufacturers
the
search
engines
and
so
on
they
frequently
made
no
sense
from
the
perspective
of
those
proposing
them
attempting
to
twist
the
law
to
make
it
illegal
for
technology
to
interfere
with
your
old
business
method
is
frequently
bad
for
the
industry
seeking
the
protection
as
well
as
for
the
technology
the
market
and
the
wider
society
since
this
worldview
makes
incumbents
systematically
blind
to
making
opportunities
that
could
be
secured
by
greater
openness
rather
than
greater
control
it
actually
disables
them
from
pursuing
some
of
the
most
promising
methods
by
which
they
could
have
made
money
for
their
shareholders
again
the
chapter
on
the
sony
decision
offers
a
salutary
example
economic
determinism
does
not
explain
the
rules
we
have
neither
are
those
rules
simply
a
result
of
the
manipulation
of
elected
officials
by
incumbent
industries
through
crafty
campaign
contributions
and
distorted
evidence
though
to
be
sure
there
was
a
lot
of
that
as
well
many
of
the
people
who
put
forward
this
worldview
both
lobbyists
and
lobbied
sincerely
believe
that
more
rights
will
always
lead
to
more
innovation
that
all
property
rights
are
the
same
that
we
do
not
need
to
think
about
both
the
input
and
output
sides
of
the
equation
that
cheaper
copying
techniques
automatically
require
greater
protections
and
so
on
what
of
the
modest
suggestions
i
put
forward
here
we
could
sum
them
up
thus
do
not
apply
identical
assumptions
to
physical
and
intellectual
property
focus
on
both
the
inputs
to
and
the
outputs
of
the
creative
process
protecting
the
latter
may
increase
the
cost
of
the
former
look
both
at
the
role
of
the
public
domain
and
the
commons
of
cultural
and
scientific
material
and
at
the
need
to
provide
incentives
for
creativity
and
distribution
through
exclusive
rights
more
rights
will
not
automatically
produce
more
innovation
indeed
we
should
confine
rights
as
narrowly
as
possible
while
still
providing
the
desired
result
look
at
the
empirical
evidence
before
and
after
increasing
the
level
of
protection
pay
attention
to
the
benefits
as
well
as
the
costs
of
the
new
technologies
and
the
flowering
of
creativity
they
enable
to
me
these
points
seem
bland
boring
obvious
verging
on
tautology
or
pablum
to
many
believers
in
the
worldview
i
have
described
they
are
either
straightforward
heresy
or
a
smokescreen
for
some
real
underlying
agenda
which
is
identified
as
communism
anarchism
or
somewhat
confusingly
both
this
account
smacks
of
exaggeration
i
know
how
could
things
be
so
the
best
answer
i
can
give
came
from
a
question
i
was
asked
at
a
recent
conference
the
questioner
pointed
out
politely
that
it
was
unlikely
that
the
process
would
ignore
such
a
fundamental
and
obvious
set
of
points
points
that
i
myself
observed
had
been
well
understood
for
hundreds
of
years
i
had
used
many
examples
of
intellectual
property
rights
being
extended
in
length
breadth
scope
why
had
i
not
spoken
he
asked
of
all
the
times
over
the
last
fifty
years
when
intellectual
property
rights
had
been
weakened
curtailed
shortened
since
human
beings
were
fallible
surely
there
were
occasions
when
the
length
of
a
copyright
or
patent
term
had
proved
to
be
too
long
or
the
scope
of
a
right
too
large
and
the
rights
had
been
narrowed
appropriately
by
legislation
why
did
i
not
cite
any
of
these
the
answer
is
simple
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
are
none
legislatively
intellectual
property
rights
have
moved
only
in
one
direction
outward
court
decisions
present
a
more
complex
picture
as
the
previous
chapter
discussion
of
software
copyrights
and
business
method
patents
shows
what
are
the
odds
that
the
costs
of
new
technologies
are
always
greater
than
their
benefits
as
far
as
intellectual
property
rights
holders
are
concerned
this
pattern
is
not
a
matter
of
policies
carefully
crafted
around
the
evidence
it
is
the
fossil
record
of
fifty
years
of
maximalism
if
i
lean
toward
the
other
side
of
the
story
it
is
not
because
i
am
a
foe
of
intellectual
property
it
is
because
i
believe
our
policies
have
become
fundamentally
unbalanced
unbalanced
in
ways
that
actually
blind
us
to
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
of
creativity
we
are
living
through
an
that
there
are
other
methods
of
generating
innovation
expression
and
creativity
than
the
proprietary
exclusionary
model
of
sole
control
true
these
methods
existed
before
yet
they
tended
to
be
local
or
invisible
or
both
the
internet
has
shown
conclusively
and
visibly
that
at
least
in
certain
sectors
we
can
have
a
global
flowering
of
creativity
innovation
and
information
sharing
in
which
intellectual
property
rights
function
in
a
very
different
way
than
under
the
standard
model
of
proprietary
control
in
some
cases
intellectual
property
rights
were
simply
irrelevant
much
of
the
information
sharing
and
indexing
on
the
web
falls
within
this
category
in
some
cases
they
were
used
to
prevent
exclusivity
think
of
creative
commons
or
the
general
public
license
in
some
they
were
actually
impediments
software
patents
for
example
have
a
negative
effect
on
open
source
software
development
one
that
policy
makers
are
only
now
slowly
beginning
to
acknowledge
it
is
important
not
to
overstate
how
far
the
sharing
economy
can
get
us
it
might
help
to
cut
the
costs
of
drug
development
as
the
tropical
disease
initiative
attempts
to
do
for
neglected
diseases
it
will
not
generate
a
phase
iii
drug
trial
or
bring
a
drug
to
market
sharing
methods
might
be
used
to
generate
cult
movies
such
as
star
wreck
in
the
pirkinning
which
was
created
using
techniques
borrowed
from
open
source
software
and
is
available
under
a
creative
commons
license
they
will
not
produce
a
mammoth
blockbuster
like
ben
hur
or
waterworld
for
that
matter
results
that
will
generate
mixed
feelings
so
there
are
real
limitations
to
the
processes
i
describe
but
even
acknowledging
those
limitations
it
is
fair
to
say
that
one
of
the
most
striking
events
to
occur
during
our
lifetimes
is
the
transformation
wrought
by
the
web
a
transformation
that
is
partly
driven
by
the
extraordinary
explosion
of
nonproprietary
creativity
and
sharing
across
digital
networks
the
cultural
expectation
that
a
web
of
expression
and
information
will
just
be
there
whatever
subject
we
are
discussing
is
a
fundamental
one
the
one
that
in
some
sense
separates
us
from
our
children
with
this
as
a
background
it
is
both
bizarre
and
perverse
that
we
choose
to
concentrate
our
policy
making
only
on
maintaining
the
business
methods
of
the
last
century
only
on
the
story
line
of
the
internet
threat
only
on
the
dangers
that
the
technology
poses
to
creativity
and
it
does
pose
some
and
never
on
the
benefits
what
would
it
mean
to
pay
attention
to
the
changes
i
have
described
it
would
mean
assessing
the
impact
of
rules
on
both
proprietary
and
nonproprietary
production
for
example
if
the
introduction
of
a
broad
regime
of
software
patents
would
render
open
source
software
development
more
difficult
because
individual
contributors
can
not
afford
to
do
a
patent
search
on
every
piece
of
code
they
contribute
then
this
should
be
reflected
as
a
cost
of
software
patents
to
be
balanced
against
whatever
benefits
the
system
brought
a
method
for
encouraging
innovation
might
in
fact
inhibit
one
form
of
it
paying
attention
to
the
last
ten
years
means
we
need
to
realize
that
nonproprietary
distributed
production
is
not
the
poor
relation
of
traditional
proprietary
hierarchically
organized
production
this
is
no
hippy
lovefest
it
is
the
business
method
on
which
ibm
has
staked
billions
of
dollars
the
method
of
cultural
production
that
generates
much
of
the
information
each
of
us
uses
every
day
it
is
just
as
deserving
of
respect
and
the
solicitude
of
policy
makers
as
the
more
familiar
methods
pursued
by
the
film
studios
and
proprietary
software
companies
losses
due
to
sharing
that
failed
because
of
artificially
erected
legal
barriers
are
every
bit
as
real
as
losses
that
come
about
because
of
illicit
copying
yet
our
attention
goes
entirely
to
the
latter
the
main
thrust
of
the
argument
here
is
still
firmly
within
the
jeffersonian
scottish
enlightenment
tradition
jefferson
does
not
wish
to
give
the
patent
to
oliver
evans
because
he
believes
the
invention
will
be
and
has
been
generated
anyway
without
the
granting
of
an
intellectual
property
right
and
that
there
are
sufficient
information
retrieval
methods
to
have
practical
access
to
it
in
this
case
the
information
retrieval
method
is
not
google
it
is
a
polymath
genius
combing
his
library
in
monticello
for
references
to
persian
irrigation
methods
the
embarrassment
caused
by
the
unnecessary
patent
is
added
expense
and
bureaucracy
in
agriculture
and
impediments
to
further
innovators
not
the
undermining
of
open
source
software
but
it
is
the
same
principle
of
cautious
minimalism
the
same
belief
that
much
innovation
goes
on
without
proprietary
control
and
that
intellectual
property
rights
are
the
exception
not
the
rule
when
benjamin
franklin
a
man
who
surely
deserved
patents
under
even
the
most
stringent
set
of
tests
chooses
to
forgo
them
because
he
has
secured
so
much
benefit
from
the
contributions
of
others
he
expresses
shirky
norm
nicely
indeed
jefferson
optimism
depends
partly
on
a
view
of
information
sharing
that
captures
beautifully
the
attitudes
of
the
generation
that
built
the
web
the
letter
that
i
discussed
in
chapter
was
widely
cited
for
precisely
this
reason
remember
these
lines
that
ideas
should
freely
spread
from
one
to
another
over
the
globe
for
the
moral
and
mutual
instruction
of
man
and
improvement
of
his
condition
seems
to
have
been
peculiarly
and
benevolently
designed
by
nature
when
she
made
them
like
fire
expansible
over
all
space
without
lessening
their
density
in
any
point
and
like
the
air
in
which
we
breathe
move
and
have
our
physical
being
incapable
of
confinement
or
exclusive
appropriation
what
could
encapsulate
better
the
process
by
which
information
spreads
on
a
global
network
what
could
more
elegantly
state
the
norms
of
the
information
wants
to
be
free
generation
though
those
who
quoted
him
conveniently
omitted
the
portions
of
his
analysis
where
he
concedes
that
there
are
cases
where
intellectual
property
rights
may
be
necessary
and
desirable
in
some
ways
then
the
explosion
of
nonproprietary
and
in
many
cases
noncommercial
creativity
and
information
sharing
is
simply
the
vindication
of
jefferson
comparison
of
ideas
with
fire
expansible
over
all
space
the
web
makes
the
simile
a
reality
and
puts
an
exclamation
point
at
the
end
of
the
jefferson
warning
all
the
more
reason
to
pay
attention
to
it
but
the
creative
commons
i
described
here
goes
further
it
forces
us
to
reconceptualize
a
form
of
life
a
method
of
production
and
a
means
of
social
organization
that
we
used
to
relegate
to
the
private
world
of
informal
sharing
and
collaboration
denied
a
commons
by
bad
intellectual
property
rules
we
can
sometimes
build
our
own
which
may
in
some
ways
do
even
more
for
us
than
the
zone
of
free
trade
free
thought
and
free
action
that
jefferson
wished
to
protect
does
all
this
mean
that
the
jefferson
warning
is
no
longer
necessary
can
we
mitigate
the
negative
effects
of
intellectual
property
expansion
through
a
series
of
privately
constructed
commons
the
answers
to
those
questions
are
respectively
no
and
sometimes
think
of
the
story
of
retrospectively
extended
copyright
and
orphan
works
in
many
cases
the
problem
with
our
intellectual
property
rights
is
that
they
create
barriers
to
sharing
without
producing
an
incentive
in
return
in
ways
that
can
never
be
solved
through
private
agreement
twentieth
century
culture
will
largely
remain
for
digitization
reproduction
adaptation
and
translation
no
series
of
private
contracts
or
licenses
can
fix
the
problem
because
the
relevant
parties
are
not
in
the
room
and
might
not
agree
if
they
were
even
when
the
parties
are
available
and
agree
to
share
the
benefits
may
not
flow
to
all
equally
beset
by
a
multitude
of
vague
patents
of
questionable
worth
and
uncertain
scope
large
information
technology
firms
routinely
create
patent
pools
ibm
tosses
in
thousands
of
patents
so
does
hewlett
or
dell
each
agrees
not
to
sue
the
other
this
is
great
for
the
established
companies
they
can
proceed
without
fear
of
legal
action
from
the
landmine
patents
that
litter
the
technological
landscape
as
far
as
the
participants
are
concerned
the
patent
pool
is
almost
like
the
public
domain
but
a
privatized
public
domain
a
park
that
only
residents
may
enter
but
what
about
the
start
up
company
that
does
not
have
the
thousands
of
patents
necessary
for
entry
they
are
not
in
as
happy
a
situation
the
patent
pool
fixes
the
problem
of
poor
patent
quality
and
unclear
scope
one
that
jefferson
was
worrying
about
years
ago
but
it
fixes
it
only
for
the
dominant
firms
hurting
competition
in
the
process
attempts
to
form
a
commons
may
also
backfire
the
coordination
problems
are
legion
there
are
difficulties
of
compatibility
in
licenses
and
the
process
no
matter
how
easy
still
imposes
transaction
costs
nevertheless
with
all
of
these
qualifications
the
idea
of
the
privately
created
commons
is
an
important
addition
to
the
world
view
that
jefferson
provided
a
new
tool
in
our
attempt
to
craft
a
working
system
of
innovation
and
culture
no
one
who
looks
at
the
web
can
doubt
the
power
of
distributed
and
frequently
uncompensated
creativity
in
constructing
remarkable
reference
works
operating
systems
cultural
conversations
even
libraries
of
images
and
music
some
of
that
innovation
happens
largely
outside
of
the
world
of
intellectual
property
some
of
it
happens
in
privately
created
areas
of
sharing
that
use
property
rights
and
open
sometimes
even
licenses
to
create
a
commons
on
which
others
can
build
the
world
of
creativity
and
its
methods
is
wider
than
we
had
thought
that
is
one
of
the
vital
and
exciting
lessons
the
internet
teaches
us
unfortunately
the
only
one
our
policy
makers
seem
to
hear
is
cheaper
copying
means
more
piracy
chapter
an
zone
perhaps
some
of
the
arguments
in
this
book
have
convinced
you
perhaps
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
of
intellectual
property
in
the
same
way
we
think
of
physical
property
perhaps
limitations
and
exceptions
to
those
rights
are
as
important
as
the
rights
themselves
perhaps
the
public
domain
has
a
vital
and
tragically
neglected
role
to
play
in
innovation
and
culture
perhaps
relentlessly
expanding
property
rights
will
not
automatically
bring
us
increased
innovation
in
science
and
culture
perhaps
the
second
enclosure
movement
is
more
troubling
than
the
first
perhaps
it
is
unwise
to
extend
copyright
again
and
again
and
to
do
so
retrospectively
locking
up
most
of
culture
in
order
to
protect
the
tiny
fragment
of
it
that
is
still
commercially
available
perhaps
technological
improvements
bring
both
benefits
and
costs
to
existing
rights
holders
both
of
which
should
be
considered
when
setting
policy
perhaps
we
need
a
vigorous
set
of
internal
limitations
and
exceptions
within
copyright
or
control
over
content
will
inevitably
become
control
over
the
medium
of
transmission
perhaps
the
internet
should
make
us
think
seriously
about
the
power
of
nonproprietary
and
distributed
production
saying
all
this
gives
us
some
guidance
in
how
we
should
think
it
points
out
certain
patterns
of
error
but
its
prescriptions
are
not
simple
precisely
because
it
is
not
a
rejection
of
intellectual
property
rights
but
rather
a
claim
that
they
only
work
well
through
a
process
of
consciously
balancing
openness
and
control
public
domain
and
private
right
it
still
leaves
open
the
question
of
where
that
point
of
balance
is
and
how
to
strike
it
in
this
chapter
i
want
to
offer
a
suggestion
that
in
any
other
field
would
be
stunningly
obvious
boring
even
but
in
the
funhouse
mirror
of
intellectual
property
appears
revolutionary
we
should
make
our
policy
based
on
empirical
evidence
of
its
likely
effects
and
there
should
be
a
formal
requirement
of
empirical
reconsideration
of
those
policies
after
they
have
been
implemented
to
see
if
they
are
working
why
is
this
a
good
idea
imagine
a
process
of
reviewing
prescription
drugs
that
goes
like
this
representatives
from
the
drug
company
come
to
the
regulators
and
argue
that
their
drug
works
well
and
should
be
approved
they
have
no
evidence
of
this
beyond
a
few
anecdotes
about
people
who
want
to
take
it
and
perhaps
some
very
simple
models
of
how
the
drug
might
affect
the
human
body
the
drug
is
approved
no
trials
no
empirical
evidence
of
any
kind
no
or
imagine
a
process
of
making
environmental
regulations
in
which
there
were
no
data
and
no
attempts
to
gather
data
about
the
effects
of
the
particular
pollutants
being
studied
even
the
harshest
critics
of
regulation
would
admit
we
generally
do
better
than
this
but
this
is
often
the
way
we
make
intellectual
property
policy
so
how
do
we
decide
the
ground
rules
of
the
information
age
representatives
of
interested
industries
come
to
regulators
and
ask
for
another
heaping
slice
of
monopoly
rent
in
the
form
of
an
intellectual
property
right
they
have
predictions
they
have
anecdotes
carefully
selected
to
pluck
the
heartstrings
of
legislators
they
have
celebrities
who
testify
often
incoherently
but
with
palpable
charisma
and
they
have
very
very
simple
economic
models
the
basic
economic
model
here
is
if
you
give
me
a
larger
right
i
will
have
a
larger
incentive
to
innovate
thus
the
bigger
the
rights
the
more
innovation
we
will
get
right
as
i
have
tried
to
show
here
using
the
words
of
jefferson
and
macaulay
and
examples
such
as
term
extension
software
copyrights
and
garage
door
openers
this
logic
is
fallacious
even
without
data
the
more
is
better
idea
is
obviously
flawed
copyrighting
the
alphabet
will
not
produce
more
books
patenting
will
not
yield
more
scientific
innovation
intellectual
property
creates
barriers
to
as
well
as
incentives
toward
innovation
jefferson
agonized
over
the
issue
of
when
the
benefits
exceed
the
costs
of
a
new
right
i
know
well
the
difficulty
of
drawing
a
line
between
the
things
which
are
worth
to
the
public
the
embarrassment
of
an
exclusive
patent
and
those
which
are
not
it
is
not
clear
that
contemporary
policy
makers
approach
issues
with
anything
like
the
same
sophistication
or
humility
but
it
would
be
an
equal
mistake
to
conclude
as
some
do
that
expansions
of
intellectual
property
are
never
justified
extensions
of
rights
can
help
or
hurt
but
without
economic
evidence
beforehand
and
review
afterward
we
will
never
know
this
point
should
be
obvious
banal
even
deeply
boring
but
sadly
it
is
not
from
jefferson
and
macaulay
and
adam
smith
i
derived
a
second
point
in
the
absence
of
evidence
on
either
side
the
presumption
should
be
against
creating
a
new
legalized
monopoly
the
burden
of
proof
should
lie
on
those
who
claim
in
any
particular
case
that
the
state
should
step
in
to
stop
competition
outlaw
copying
proscribe
technology
or
restrict
speech
they
have
to
show
us
that
the
existing
protection
is
not
enough
but
this
presumption
is
a
solution
and
the
empirical
emptiness
of
the
debates
frustrating
this
makes
an
occasion
where
there
is
some
evidence
a
time
for
celebration
what
we
need
is
a
test
case
in
which
one
country
adopts
the
proposed
new
intellectual
property
right
and
another
similarly
situated
country
does
not
and
we
can
assess
how
they
are
both
doing
after
a
number
of
years
there
is
such
a
case
it
is
the
database
right
owning
facts
europe
adopted
a
database
directive
in
which
gave
a
high
level
of
copyright
protection
to
databases
and
conferred
a
new
sui
generis
database
right
even
on
unoriginal
compilations
of
facts
in
the
united
states
by
contrast
in
a
case
called
feist
publications
rural
telephone
service
the
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
unoriginal
compilations
of
facts
are
not
copyrightable
what
does
all
this
mean
take
the
phone
directory
that
was
the
product
at
issue
in
the
feist
case
a
white
pages
directory
is
a
database
of
names
and
numbers
compiled
in
alphabetical
order
by
name
does
anyone
have
an
intellectual
property
right
over
it
not
the
particular
directory
lying
next
to
your
phone
does
the
phone
company
that
compiled
it
own
the
facts
the
numbers
inside
that
directory
could
they
forbid
me
from
copying
them
adding
others
from
surrounding
areas
and
issuing
a
competing
directory
that
i
believed
consumers
would
find
more
valuable
this
was
an
important
issue
for
feist
because
it
went
to
the
heart
of
their
business
they
issued
regional
telephone
directories
combining
records
from
multiple
phone
companies
in
this
case
all
the
other
companies
in
the
region
agreed
to
license
their
data
to
feist
rural
did
not
so
feist
copied
the
information
checked
as
many
entries
as
possible
adding
addresses
to
some
of
the
listings
and
published
the
combined
result
rural
sued
and
lost
the
supreme
court
declared
that
mere
alphabetical
listings
and
other
unoriginal
assemblies
of
data
can
not
be
copyrighted
it
may
seem
unfair
that
much
of
the
fruit
of
the
labor
may
be
used
by
others
without
compensation
as
justice
brennan
has
correctly
observed
however
this
is
not
some
unforeseen
byproduct
of
a
statutory
scheme
it
is
rather
the
essence
of
copyright
and
a
constitutional
requirement
the
primary
objective
of
copyright
is
not
to
reward
the
labor
of
authors
but
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
to
this
end
copyright
assures
authors
the
right
to
their
original
expression
but
encourages
others
to
build
freely
upon
the
ideas
and
information
conveyed
by
a
work
this
principle
known
as
the
or
dichotomy
applies
to
all
works
of
authorship
as
applied
to
a
factual
compilation
assuming
the
absence
of
original
written
expression
only
the
compiler
selection
and
arrangement
may
be
protected
the
raw
facts
may
be
copied
at
will
this
result
is
neither
unfair
nor
unfortunate
it
is
the
means
by
which
copyright
advances
the
progress
of
science
and
feist
was
not
as
revolutionary
as
some
critics
claimed
it
to
be
most
of
the
appeals
courts
in
the
united
states
had
long
held
this
to
be
the
case
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
passage
above
it
is
a
fundamental
tenet
of
the
intellectual
property
system
that
neither
facts
nor
ideas
can
be
owned
feist
merely
reiterated
that
point
clearly
and
stressed
that
it
was
not
just
a
policy
choice
it
was
a
constitutional
requirement
a
limit
imposed
by
the
constitution
grant
of
power
to
congress
to
make
copyright
and
patent
laws
daily
politics
cares
little
for
the
limitations
imposed
by
constitutions
or
for
the
structural
principle
the
court
describes
that
we
should
leave
facts
free
for
others
to
build
upon
since
a
few
database
companies
have
lobbied
the
congress
strenuously
and
continuously
to
create
a
special
database
right
over
facts
interestingly
apart
from
academics
scientists
and
civil
libertarians
many
database
companies
and
even
those
property
haters
the
chamber
of
commerce
oppose
the
creation
of
such
a
right
they
believe
that
database
providers
can
adequately
protect
themselves
with
contracts
or
technical
means
such
as
passwords
can
rely
on
providing
tied
services
and
so
on
moreover
they
argue
that
strong
database
protection
may
make
it
harder
to
generate
databases
in
the
first
place
the
facts
you
need
may
be
locked
up
we
need
to
focus
on
the
inputs
as
well
as
the
outputs
of
the
process
a
point
i
have
tried
to
make
throughout
this
book
the
pressure
to
create
a
new
right
continues
however
aided
by
cries
that
the
united
states
must
harmonize
with
europe
where
you
will
remember
compilations
of
facts
are
strongly
protected
by
intellectual
property
rights
even
if
their
arrangement
is
unoriginal
so
here
we
have
our
natural
experiment
one
major
economy
rejects
such
protection
and
resists
pressure
to
create
a
new
right
a
different
major
economic
region
at
a
comparable
level
of
development
institutes
the
right
with
the
explicit
claim
that
it
will
help
to
produce
new
databases
and
make
that
segment
of
the
economy
more
competitive
presumably
government
economists
in
the
united
states
and
the
european
union
have
been
hard
at
work
ever
since
seeing
if
the
right
actually
worked
well
not
exactly
despite
the
fact
that
the
european
commission
has
a
legal
obligation
to
review
the
database
directive
for
its
effects
on
competition
it
was
more
than
three
years
late
issuing
its
report
at
first
during
the
review
process
no
attention
was
paid
to
the
actual
evidence
of
whether
the
directive
helps
or
hurts
the
european
union
or
whether
the
database
industry
in
the
united
states
has
collapsed
or
flourished
that
is
a
shame
because
the
evidence
was
there
and
it
was
fairly
shocking
yet
finally
at
the
end
of
the
process
the
commission
did
turn
to
the
evidence
as
i
will
recount
and
came
to
a
remarkable
conclusion
which
was
promptly
stifled
for
political
reasons
but
we
are
getting
ahead
of
ourselves
how
do
we
frame
the
empirical
inquiry
intellectual
property
rights
allow
the
creation
of
monopolies
and
the
general
tendency
of
monopolies
as
macaulay
pointed
out
is
to
make
articles
scarce
to
make
them
dear
and
to
make
them
bad
monopolies
are
an
evil
but
they
must
sometimes
be
accepted
when
they
are
necessary
to
the
production
of
some
good
some
particular
social
goal
in
this
case
the
evil
is
obviously
going
to
be
an
increase
in
the
price
of
databases
and
the
legal
ability
to
exclude
competitors
from
their
use
that
after
all
is
the
point
of
granting
the
new
right
this
right
of
exclusion
may
then
have
dynamic
effects
hampering
the
ability
of
subsequent
innovators
to
build
on
what
went
before
the
good
is
that
we
are
supposed
to
get
lots
of
new
databases
databases
that
we
would
not
have
had
but
for
the
existence
of
the
database
right
if
the
database
right
were
working
we
would
expect
positive
answers
to
three
crucial
questions
first
has
the
european
database
industry
rate
of
growth
increased
since
while
the
database
industry
has
languished
the
in
the
database
industry
ought
to
be
particularly
severe
after
if
the
proponents
of
database
protection
are
correct
they
argued
the
feist
case
was
a
change
in
current
law
and
a
great
surprise
to
the
industry
second
are
the
principal
beneficiaries
of
the
database
right
in
europe
producing
databases
they
would
not
have
produced
otherwise
obviously
if
a
society
is
handing
over
a
database
right
for
a
database
that
would
have
been
created
anyway
it
is
overpaying
needlessly
increasing
prices
for
consumers
and
burdens
for
competitors
this
goes
to
the
design
of
the
right
has
it
been
crafted
too
broadly
so
that
it
is
not
being
targeted
to
those
areas
where
it
is
needed
to
encourage
innovation
third
and
this
one
is
harder
to
judge
is
the
new
right
promoting
innovation
and
competition
rather
than
stifling
it
for
example
if
the
existence
of
the
right
allowed
a
surge
of
newcomers
to
the
market
who
then
use
their
rights
to
discourage
new
entrants
or
if
we
promoted
some
increase
in
databases
but
made
scientific
aggregation
of
large
amounts
of
data
harder
overall
then
the
database
right
might
actually
be
stifling
the
innovation
it
is
designed
to
foment
those
are
the
three
questions
that
any
review
of
the
database
directive
must
answer
but
we
have
preliminary
answers
to
those
three
questions
and
they
are
either
strongly
negative
or
extremely
doubtful
are
database
rights
necessary
for
a
thriving
database
industry
the
answer
appears
to
be
no
in
the
united
states
the
database
industry
has
grown
more
than
since
and
contrary
to
those
who
paint
the
feist
case
as
a
revolution
for
that
entire
period
in
most
of
the
united
states
it
was
clear
that
unoriginal
databases
were
not
covered
by
copyright
the
figures
are
even
more
interesting
in
the
legal
database
market
the
two
major
proponents
of
database
protection
in
the
united
states
are
reed
elsevier
the
owner
of
lexis
and
thomson
publishing
the
owner
of
westlaw
fascinatingly
both
companies
made
their
key
acquisitions
in
the
legal
database
market
after
the
feist
decision
at
which
point
no
one
could
have
thought
unoriginal
databases
were
copyrightable
this
seems
to
be
some
evidence
that
they
believed
they
could
make
money
even
without
a
database
right
how
in
the
way
competing
on
features
accuracy
tied
services
making
users
pay
for
entry
to
the
database
and
so
on
if
those
companies
believed
there
were
profits
to
be
made
they
were
right
jason
gelman
a
former
duke
student
pointed
out
in
a
recent
paper
that
thomson
legal
regulatory
division
had
a
profit
margin
of
over
percent
for
the
first
quarter
of
reed
elsevier
profit
margin
for
lexisnexis
was
percent
both
profit
margins
were
significantly
higher
than
the
company
average
and
both
were
earned
primarily
in
the
billion
legal
database
market
a
market
which
is
thriving
without
strong
intellectual
property
protection
over
databases
first
rule
of
thumb
for
regulators
when
someone
with
a
profit
margin
over
percent
asks
you
for
additional
monopoly
protection
pause
before
agreeing
what
about
europe
there
is
some
good
news
for
the
proponents
of
database
protection
as
hugenholtz
maurer
and
onsrud
point
out
in
a
nice
article
in
science
magazine
there
was
a
sharp
time
spike
in
the
number
of
companies
entering
the
european
database
market
immediately
following
the
implementation
of
the
directive
in
member
yet
their
work
and
across
two
worlds
a
fascinating
study
by
maurer
suggests
that
the
rate
of
entry
then
fell
back
to
levels
similar
to
those
before
the
directive
maurer
analysis
shows
that
the
attrition
rate
was
also
very
high
in
some
european
markets
in
the
period
following
the
passage
of
the
directive
even
with
the
new
right
many
companies
dropped
out
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
british
database
industry
the
strongest
performer
in
europe
added
about
two
hundred
databases
in
the
three
years
immediately
after
the
implementation
of
the
directive
in
france
there
was
little
net
change
in
the
number
of
databases
and
the
number
of
providers
fell
sharply
in
germany
the
industry
added
nearly
three
hundred
databases
immediately
following
the
directive
a
remarkable
surge
about
two
hundred
of
which
rapidly
disappeared
during
the
same
period
the
industry
added
about
nine
hundred
databases
bottom
line
europe
industry
did
get
a
boost
and
some
of
those
firms
have
stayed
in
the
market
that
is
a
benefit
though
a
costly
one
but
database
growth
rates
have
gone
back
to
predirective
levels
while
the
anticompetitive
costs
of
database
protection
are
now
a
permanent
fixture
of
the
european
landscape
the
united
states
by
contrast
gets
a
nice
steady
growth
rate
in
databases
without
paying
the
monopoly
cost
second
rule
of
thumb
for
regulators
do
no
harm
do
not
create
rights
without
strong
evidence
that
the
incentive
effect
is
worth
the
anticompetitive
cost
now
the
second
question
is
the
database
directive
encouraging
the
production
of
databases
we
would
not
have
gotten
otherwise
here
the
evidence
is
clear
and
disturbing
again
hugenholtz
et
al
point
out
that
the
majority
of
cases
brought
under
the
directive
have
been
about
databases
that
would
have
been
created
anyway
telephone
numbers
television
schedules
concert
times
a
review
of
more
recent
cases
reveals
the
same
pattern
these
databases
are
inevitably
generated
by
the
operation
of
the
business
in
question
and
can
not
be
independently
compiled
by
a
competitor
the
database
right
simply
serves
to
limit
competition
in
the
provision
of
the
information
recently
the
european
court
of
justice
implicitly
underscored
this
point
in
a
series
of
cases
concerning
football
scores
horse
racing
results
and
so
on
rejecting
a
protectionist
and
opinion
from
its
advocate
general
the
court
ruled
that
the
mere
running
of
a
business
which
generates
data
does
not
count
as
substantial
investment
sufficient
to
trigger
the
database
right
it
would
be
nice
to
think
that
this
is
the
beginning
of
some
skepticism
about
the
reach
of
the
directive
yet
the
court
provides
little
discussion
of
the
economic
reasons
behind
its
interpretation
the
analysis
is
merely
semantic
and
definitional
a
sharp
contrast
to
its
competition
decisions
so
what
kinds
of
creations
are
being
generated
by
this
bold
new
right
the
answer
is
somewhere
between
bathos
and
pathos
here
are
some
of
the
wonderful
databases
that
people
found
it
worthwhile
litigating
over
a
web
site
consisting
of
a
collection
of
hyperlinks
to
parenting
resources
a
collection
of
poems
an
assortment
of
advertisements
headings
referring
to
local
news
and
charts
of
popular
music
the
sad
list
goes
on
and
on
the
european
commission
might
ask
itself
whether
these
are
really
the
kind
of
databases
that
we
need
a
legal
monopoly
to
encourage
and
that
we
want
to
tie
up
judicial
resources
protecting
the
point
that
many
more
such
factual
resources
can
be
found
online
in
the
united
states
without
any
legalized
database
protection
also
seems
worthy
of
note
at
the
very
least
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
right
is
drawn
much
too
broadly
and
triggered
too
easily
in
ways
that
produce
litigation
but
little
social
benefit
now
in
one
sense
these
lawsuits
over
trivial
collections
of
hyperlinks
and
headlines
might
be
seen
as
irrelevant
they
may
indicate
we
are
handing
out
rights
unnecessarily
did
we
really
need
a
legal
monopoly
and
court
involvement
to
get
someone
to
compile
hyperlinks
on
a
web
page
but
it
is
hard
to
see
social
harm
as
with
the
patents
over
sealed
crustless
peanut
butter
sandwiches
or
methods
of
swinging
on
a
swing
we
may
shake
our
heads
at
the
stupidity
of
the
system
but
if
the
problems
consist
only
of
trivial
creations
at
least
we
are
not
likely
to
grieve
because
some
vital
piece
of
information
was
locked
up
but
we
should
not
be
so
quick
to
declare
such
examples
irrelevant
they
tend
to
show
that
the
system
for
drawing
the
boundaries
of
the
right
is
broken
and
that
is
of
general
concern
even
if
the
issue
at
hand
is
not
finally
is
the
database
right
encouraging
scientific
innovation
or
hurting
it
here
the
evidence
is
merely
suggestive
scientists
have
claimed
that
the
european
database
right
together
with
the
perverse
failure
of
european
governments
to
take
advantage
of
the
limited
scientific
research
exceptions
allowed
by
the
directive
have
made
it
much
harder
to
aggregate
data
to
replicate
studies
and
to
judge
published
articles
in
fact
academic
scientific
bodies
have
been
among
the
strongest
critics
of
database
protection
but
negative
evidence
by
its
nature
is
hard
to
produce
show
me
the
science
that
did
not
get
done
certainly
both
science
and
commerce
have
benefited
extraordinarily
from
the
openness
of
data
policy
i
will
deal
with
this
issue
in
the
next
part
of
this
chapter
if
the
united
states
does
not
give
intellectual
property
protection
to
raw
data
to
facts
how
is
it
that
the
database
industry
has
managed
to
thrive
here
and
to
do
better
than
in
europe
which
has
extremely
strong
protection
the
economists
described
in
chapter
would
surely
tell
us
that
this
is
a
potential
public
goods
problem
if
it
is
hard
to
exclude
others
from
the
resource
it
is
cheap
and
easy
to
copy
and
if
the
use
of
the
resource
is
not
rival
if
i
do
use
up
your
facts
by
consulting
them
then
we
ought
to
see
the
kind
of
dystopia
economists
predict
what
would
that
consist
of
first
it
might
result
in
underproduction
databases
with
a
social
value
higher
than
their
cost
of
creation
would
not
get
made
because
the
creator
could
not
get
an
adequate
return
on
investment
in
some
cases
it
might
even
lead
to
the
reverse
overproduction
where
each
party
creates
the
database
for
itself
we
get
a
social
overinvestment
to
produce
the
resource
because
there
is
no
legal
right
to
exclude
others
from
it
if
you
gave
the
first
creator
an
intellectual
property
right
over
the
data
they
could
sell
to
subsequent
users
at
a
price
lower
than
their
own
cost
to
create
the
database
everyone
would
win
but
the
united
states
did
not
give
the
intellectual
property
right
and
yet
its
database
industry
is
flourishing
there
are
lots
of
commercial
database
providers
and
many
different
kinds
of
databases
how
can
this
be
is
the
economic
model
wrong
the
answer
to
that
is
no
the
model
is
not
wrong
it
is
however
incomplete
and
all
too
often
applied
in
sweeping
ways
without
acknowledging
that
its
basic
assumptions
may
not
hold
in
a
particular
case
that
sounds
vague
let
me
give
a
concrete
example
westlaw
is
one
of
the
two
leading
legal
database
providers
and
as
i
mentioned
before
one
of
the
key
proponents
of
creating
intellectual
property
rights
over
unoriginal
databases
there
is
considerable
question
whether
such
a
law
would
be
constitutional
in
the
united
states
but
i
will
pass
over
that
argument
for
the
moment
westlaw
problem
is
that
much
of
the
material
that
it
provides
to
its
subscribers
is
not
covered
by
copyright
under
section
of
the
copyright
act
works
of
the
federal
government
can
not
be
copyrighted
they
pass
immediately
into
the
public
domain
thus
all
the
federal
court
decisions
from
district
courts
all
the
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
all
the
federal
statutes
the
infinite
complexity
of
the
federal
register
all
this
is
free
from
copyright
this
might
seem
logical
for
work
for
which
the
taxpayer
has
already
paid
but
as
i
will
explain
in
the
next
section
of
the
chapter
not
every
country
adopts
such
a
policy
west
another
thomson
subsidiary
that
owns
westlaw
publishes
the
standard
case
reporter
series
when
lawyers
or
judges
refer
to
a
particular
opinion
or
quote
a
passage
within
an
opinion
they
will
almost
always
use
the
page
number
of
the
west
edition
after
all
if
no
one
else
can
find
the
cases
or
statutes
or
paragraphs
of
an
opinion
that
you
are
referring
to
legal
argument
is
all
but
impossible
this
might
seem
like
a
great
idea
to
you
i
beg
to
differ
as
electronic
versions
of
legal
materials
became
more
prevalent
west
began
getting
more
competition
its
competitors
did
two
things
that
west
found
unforgivable
first
they
frequently
copied
the
text
of
the
cases
from
west
electronic
services
or
rather
than
retyping
them
themselves
since
the
cases
were
works
of
the
federal
government
this
was
perfectly
legal
provided
the
competitors
did
not
include
west
own
material
such
as
summaries
of
the
cases
written
by
its
employees
or
its
key
number
system
for
finding
related
issues
second
the
competitors
would
include
within
their
electronic
editions
the
page
numbers
to
west
editions
since
lawyers
need
to
cite
the
precise
words
or
arguments
they
are
referring
to
providing
the
raw
opinion
alone
would
have
been
all
but
useless
because
west
page
numbers
were
one
of
the
standard
ways
to
cite
case
opinions
competitors
would
indicate
where
the
page
breaks
on
the
printed
page
would
have
been
just
as
west
did
in
its
own
databases
west
reaction
to
all
of
this
was
exactly
like
apple
reaction
in
the
story
i
told
in
chapter
about
the
ipod
or
like
reaction
to
the
copying
of
its
phone
directory
this
was
theft
they
were
freeloading
on
west
hard
work
west
had
mixed
its
sweat
with
these
cites
and
so
should
be
able
to
exclude
other
people
from
them
since
it
could
not
claim
copyright
over
the
cases
west
claimed
copyright
over
the
order
in
which
they
were
arranged
saying
that
when
its
competitors
provided
its
page
numbers
for
citation
purposes
they
were
infringing
that
copyright
in
the
end
west
lost
its
legal
battles
to
claim
copyright
over
the
arrangement
of
the
collections
of
cases
and
the
sequence
in
which
they
were
presented
the
court
held
that
as
with
the
phone
directory
the
order
in
which
the
cases
were
arranged
lacked
the
minimum
originality
required
to
sustain
a
copyright
at
this
stage
according
to
the
standard
public
goods
story
west
business
should
have
collapsed
unable
to
exclude
competitors
from
much
of
the
raw
material
of
its
databases
west
would
be
undercut
by
competitors
more
importantly
from
the
point
of
view
of
intellectual
property
policy
its
fate
would
deter
potential
investors
in
other
databases
databases
that
we
would
lose
without
even
knowing
they
could
have
been
possible
except
that
is
not
the
way
it
turned
out
west
has
continued
to
thrive
indeed
its
profits
have
been
quite
remarkable
how
can
this
be
the
west
story
shows
us
three
ways
in
which
we
can
leap
too
quickly
from
the
abstract
claim
that
some
information
goods
are
public
goods
nonexcludable
and
nonrival
to
the
claim
that
this
particular
information
good
has
those
attributes
the
reality
is
much
more
complex
type
into
your
internet
browser
that
will
take
you
to
the
home
page
of
west
excellent
legal
research
service
now
i
have
a
password
to
that
site
you
probably
do
not
without
a
password
you
can
not
get
access
to
west
site
at
all
to
the
average
consumer
the
password
acts
as
a
physical
or
technical
barrier
making
the
good
excludable
that
is
making
it
possible
to
exclude
someone
from
it
without
invoking
intellectual
property
rights
but
what
about
competitors
they
could
buy
access
and
use
that
access
to
download
vast
quantities
of
the
material
that
is
unprotected
by
copyright
or
could
they
again
west
can
erect
a
variety
of
barriers
ranging
from
technical
limits
on
how
much
can
be
downloaded
to
contractual
restrictions
on
what
those
who
purchase
its
service
can
do
no
copying
every
federal
case
for
example
let
say
the
competitor
somehow
manages
to
get
around
all
this
let
say
it
somehow
avoids
copying
the
material
that
west
does
have
a
copyright
over
such
as
the
headnotes
and
case
synopses
the
competitor
launches
their
competing
site
at
lower
prices
amidst
much
fanfare
do
i
immediately
and
faithlessly
desert
west
for
a
competitor
not
at
all
first
of
all
there
are
lots
of
useful
things
in
the
west
database
that
are
covered
by
copyright
law
review
articles
and
certain
treatises
for
example
the
competitor
frequently
can
not
copy
those
without
coming
to
the
same
sort
of
agreements
that
west
has
with
the
copyright
holders
for
much
legal
research
that
secondary
material
is
as
important
as
the
cases
if
west
has
both
and
the
competitor
only
one
i
will
stick
with
west
second
service
is
very
well
designed
it
is
only
their
copyright
policies
i
dislike
not
the
product
if
a
judge
cites
a
law
review
article
in
a
case
west
will
helpfully
provide
a
hyperlink
to
the
precise
section
of
the
article
she
is
referring
to
i
can
click
on
it
and
in
a
second
see
what
the
substance
of
the
argument
is
the
reverse
is
true
if
a
law
review
article
cites
a
statute
or
a
case
cases
have
flags
on
them
indicating
whether
they
have
been
overruled
or
cited
approvingly
in
subsequent
decisions
in
other
words
faced
with
the
competitive
pressure
of
those
who
would
commoditize
their
service
and
provide
it
at
lower
cost
west
has
done
what
any
smart
company
would
added
features
and
competed
by
offering
a
superior
service
often
it
has
done
so
by
tying
its
uncopyrightable
data
structures
to
its
huge
library
of
copyrighted
legal
material
the
company
that
challenged
westlaw
in
court
was
called
hyperlaw
it
won
triumphantly
the
courts
declared
that
federal
cases
and
the
page
numbers
in
the
west
volumes
were
in
the
public
domain
that
decision
came
in
and
westlaw
has
lobbied
hard
since
then
to
reverse
it
by
statute
to
create
some
version
of
the
database
directive
in
the
united
states
to
date
they
have
failed
the
victor
hyperlaw
has
since
gone
out
of
business
westlaw
has
not
this
little
story
contains
a
larger
truth
it
is
true
that
innovation
and
information
goods
will
in
general
tend
to
be
less
excludable
and
less
rival
than
a
ham
sandwich
say
but
in
practice
some
of
them
will
be
linked
or
connected
in
their
social
setting
to
other
phenomena
that
are
highly
excludable
the
software
can
easily
be
copied
but
access
to
the
help
lines
can
be
restricted
with
ease
audiences
can
not
easily
be
excluded
from
viewing
television
broadcasts
but
advertisers
can
easily
be
excluded
from
placing
their
advertisements
in
those
programs
the
noncopyrightable
court
decisions
are
of
most
use
when
embedded
within
a
technical
system
that
gives
easy
access
to
other
material
some
of
it
copyrighted
and
all
of
it
protected
by
technical
measures
and
contractual
restrictions
the
music
file
can
be
downloaded
the
band
or
the
experience
of
the
live
concert
can
not
does
this
mean
that
we
never
need
an
intellectual
property
right
not
at
all
but
it
does
indicate
that
we
need
to
be
careful
when
someone
claims
that
without
a
new
intellectual
property
right
i
am
doomed
one
final
story
may
drive
home
the
point
when
they
read
feist
rural
law
students
often
assume
that
the
only
reason
feist
offered
to
license
the
white
pages
listings
from
rural
is
because
they
mistakenly
thought
they
were
copyrighted
this
is
unlikely
most
good
copyright
lawyers
would
have
told
you
at
the
time
of
the
feist
case
that
the
sweat
of
the
brow
decisions
that
gave
copyright
protection
based
on
hard
work
were
not
good
law
most
courts
of
appeals
had
said
so
true
there
was
some
legal
uncertainty
and
that
is
often
worth
paying
to
avoid
but
switch
the
question
around
and
suppose
it
is
the
day
after
the
supreme
court
decides
the
feist
case
and
feist
is
heading
off
into
another
market
to
try
to
make
a
new
regional
phone
directory
do
they
now
just
take
the
numbers
without
paying
for
them
or
do
they
still
try
to
negotiate
a
license
the
latter
is
overwhelmingly
likely
why
well
for
one
thing
they
would
get
a
version
of
the
names
and
would
not
have
to
retype
or
optically
scan
them
more
importantly
the
contract
could
include
a
right
to
immediate
updates
and
new
listings
the
day
after
the
feist
decision
the
only
thing
that
had
changed
in
the
telephone
directory
market
was
that
telephone
companies
knew
for
sure
rather
than
merely
as
a
probability
that
if
they
refused
to
license
their
competitors
could
laboriously
copy
their
old
listings
without
penalty
the
nuclear
option
was
no
longer
available
maybe
the
price
demanded
would
be
a
little
lower
but
there
would
still
be
lots
of
good
reasons
for
feist
to
buy
the
information
even
though
it
was
uncopyrighted
you
do
not
always
need
an
intellectual
property
right
to
make
a
deal
of
course
that
is
not
the
whole
story
perhaps
the
incentives
provided
by
other
methods
are
insufficient
but
in
the
database
industry
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
quite
the
contrary
the
studies
we
have
on
the
european
and
the
american
rules
on
database
rights
indicate
that
the
american
approach
simply
works
better
i
was
not
always
opposed
to
intellectual
property
rights
over
data
indeed
in
a
book
written
before
the
enactment
of
the
database
directive
i
said
that
there
was
a
respectable
economic
argument
that
such
protection
might
be
warranted
and
that
we
needed
research
on
the
unfortunately
europe
got
the
right
without
the
research
the
facts
are
now
in
if
the
european
database
directive
were
a
drug
the
government
would
be
pulling
it
from
the
market
until
its
efficacy
and
harmfulness
could
be
reassessed
at
the
very
least
the
commission
needed
a
detailed
empirical
review
of
the
directive
effects
and
needs
to
adjust
the
directive
definitions
and
its
limitations
but
there
is
a
second
lesson
there
is
more
discussion
of
the
empirical
economic
effects
of
the
database
directive
in
this
chapter
than
in
the
review
of
the
directive
that
the
european
commission
paid
a
private
company
to
conduct
and
which
was
the
first
official
document
to
consider
the
issue
that
seemed
to
me
and
to
many
other
academics
to
be
a
scandal
and
we
said
so
as
loudly
as
we
could
pointing
out
the
empirical
evidence
suggesting
that
the
directive
was
not
working
yet
if
it
was
a
scandal
it
was
not
a
surprising
one
because
the
process
is
altogether
typical
of
the
way
we
make
intellectual
property
policy
president
bush
is
not
the
only
one
to
make
decisions
there
was
however
a
ray
of
hope
in
its
official
report
on
the
competitive
effects
of
the
database
directive
the
european
commission
recently
went
beyond
reliance
on
anecdote
and
industry
testimony
and
did
something
amazing
and
admirable
it
conducted
an
empirical
evaluation
of
whether
the
directive
was
actually
doing
any
good
the
report
honestly
described
the
directive
as
a
community
creation
with
no
precedent
in
any
international
convention
using
a
methodology
similar
to
the
one
in
this
chapter
on
the
subject
the
commission
found
that
the
economic
impact
of
the
generis
right
on
database
production
is
unproven
introduced
to
stimulate
the
production
of
databases
in
europe
the
new
instrument
has
had
no
proven
impact
on
the
production
of
databases
in
fact
their
study
showed
that
the
production
of
databases
had
fallen
to
levels
and
that
the
database
industry
which
has
no
such
intellectual
property
right
was
growing
faster
than
the
european
union
the
gap
appears
to
be
widening
this
is
consistent
with
the
data
i
had
pointed
out
in
newspaper
articles
on
the
subject
but
the
commission
study
was
more
recent
and
if
anything
more
damning
commission
insiders
hinted
that
the
study
may
be
part
of
a
larger
and
welcome
transformation
in
which
a
more
professional
and
empirical
look
is
being
taken
at
the
competitive
effects
of
intellectual
property
protection
could
we
be
moving
away
from
policy
in
which
the
assumption
is
that
the
more
new
rights
we
create
the
better
off
we
will
be
perhaps
but
unfortunately
while
the
report
was
a
dramatic
improvement
traces
of
the
commission
older
predilection
for
policy
and
voodoo
economics
still
remain
the
commission
coupled
its
empirical
study
of
whether
the
directive
had
actually
stimulated
the
production
of
new
databases
with
another
intriguing
kind
of
empiricism
it
sent
out
a
questionnaire
to
the
european
database
industry
asking
if
they
liked
their
intellectual
property
right
a
procedure
with
all
the
rigor
of
setting
farm
policy
by
asking
french
farmers
how
they
feel
about
agricultural
subsidies
more
bizarrely
still
the
report
sometimes
juxtaposed
the
two
studies
as
if
they
were
of
equivalent
worth
perhaps
this
method
of
decision
making
could
be
expanded
to
other
areas
we
could
set
communications
policy
by
conducting
psychoanalytic
interviews
with
state
telephone
companies
let
current
incumbents
opinions
determine
what
is
good
for
the
market
as
a
whole
what
is
your
emotional
relationship
with
your
monopoly
i
really
like
it
do
you
think
it
hurts
competition
not
at
all
there
are
also
a
few
places
where
the
reasoning
in
the
report
left
one
scratching
one
head
one
goal
of
the
database
right
was
to
help
close
the
gap
between
the
size
of
the
european
and
database
markets
even
before
the
directive
most
european
countries
already
gave
greater
protection
than
the
united
states
to
compilations
of
fact
the
directive
raised
the
level
still
higher
the
theory
was
that
this
would
help
build
european
market
share
of
course
the
opposite
is
also
possible
setting
intellectual
property
rights
too
high
can
actually
stunt
innovation
in
practice
as
the
commission
report
observes
the
ratio
of
european
database
production
which
was
nearly
in
has
become
in
europe
had
started
with
higher
protection
and
a
smaller
market
then
it
raised
its
level
of
protection
and
lost
even
more
ground
yet
the
report
was
oddly
diffident
about
the
possibility
that
the
system
actually
works
better
in
its
conclusion
the
report
offered
a
number
of
possibilities
including
repealing
the
directive
amending
it
to
limit
or
remove
the
sui
generis
right
while
leaving
the
rest
of
the
directive
in
place
and
keeping
the
system
as
it
is
the
first
options
are
easy
to
understand
who
would
want
to
keep
a
system
when
it
is
not
increasing
database
production
or
european
market
share
and
indeed
might
be
actively
harmful
why
leave
things
as
they
are
the
report
offers
several
reasons
first
database
companies
want
to
keep
the
directive
the
report
delicately
notes
that
their
endorsement
is
somewhat
at
odds
with
the
continued
success
of
publishing
and
database
production
that
thrives
without
such
protection
but
nevertheless
appears
to
be
a
political
reality
second
repealing
the
directive
would
reopen
the
debate
on
what
level
of
protection
is
needed
third
change
may
be
costly
imagine
applying
these
arguments
to
a
drug
trial
the
patients
in
the
control
group
have
done
better
than
those
given
the
drug
and
there
is
evidence
that
the
drug
might
be
harmful
but
the
drug
companies
like
their
profits
and
want
to
keep
the
drug
on
the
market
though
somewhat
at
odds
with
the
evidence
this
is
a
political
reality
getting
rid
of
the
drug
would
reopen
the
debate
on
the
search
for
a
cure
change
is
costly
true
but
what
is
the
purpose
of
a
review
if
the
status
quo
is
always
to
be
preferred
the
final
result
faced
with
what
commission
staff
members
tell
me
was
a
tidal
wave
of
lobbying
from
publishers
the
commission
quietly
decided
to
leave
the
directive
unchanged
despite
the
evidence
the
result
itself
is
not
remarkable
industry
capture
of
a
regulatory
apparatus
is
hardly
a
surprise
what
is
remarkable
is
that
this
is
one
of
the
first
times
any
entity
engaged
in
making
intellectual
property
policy
on
the
international
level
has
even
looked
seriously
at
the
empirical
evidence
of
that
policy
effects
to
be
sure
figures
are
thrown
around
in
hearings
the
software
industry
will
present
studies
showing
for
example
that
it
has
lost
billions
of
dollars
because
of
illicit
copying
it
has
indeed
lost
profits
relative
to
what
it
could
get
with
all
the
benefits
of
cheaper
copying
and
transmission
worldwide
and
with
perfect
copyright
enforcement
as
well
though
the
methodology
of
some
of
the
studies
which
assumes
that
each
copier
would
have
paid
full
price
is
ridiculous
but
this
simply
begs
the
question
a
new
technology
is
introduced
that
increases
the
size
of
your
market
and
decreases
your
costs
dramatically
but
also
increases
illicit
copying
is
this
cause
for
state
intervention
to
increase
your
level
of
rights
or
the
funds
going
toward
enforcement
of
copyright
law
as
opposed
to
any
other
law
enforcement
priority
the
question
for
empirical
analysis
both
before
and
after
a
policy
change
should
be
is
this
change
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
incentives
for
production
and
distribution
will
whatever
benefits
it
brings
outweigh
the
costs
of
static
and
dynamic
losses
price
increases
to
consumers
and
impediments
to
future
innovators
the
content
companies
might
still
be
able
to
justify
the
extensions
of
their
rights
but
they
would
be
doing
so
in
the
context
of
a
rational
debate
about
the
real
goals
of
intellectual
property
not
on
the
assumption
that
they
have
a
natural
right
to
collect
all
the
economic
surplus
gained
by
a
reduction
in
the
costs
of
reproduction
and
distribution
does
public
information
want
to
be
free
the
united
states
has
much
to
learn
from
europe
about
information
policy
the
ineffectively
scattered
approach
to
data
privacy
for
example
produces
random
islands
of
privacy
protection
in
a
sea
of
potential
vulnerability
until
recently
your
video
rental
records
were
better
protected
than
your
medical
records
europe
by
contrast
has
tried
to
establish
a
holistic
framework
a
much
more
effective
approach
but
there
are
places
where
the
lessons
should
flow
the
other
way
the
first
one
i
have
suggested
is
database
protection
the
second
is
a
related
but
separate
issue
the
legal
treatment
of
publicly
generated
data
the
huge
and
hugely
important
flow
of
information
produced
by
activities
from
ordnance
survey
maps
and
weather
data
to
texts
traffic
studies
and
scientific
information
how
is
this
flow
of
information
distributed
the
norm
turns
out
to
be
very
different
in
the
united
states
and
in
europe
in
one
part
of
the
world
data
flows
are
frequently
viewed
as
revenue
sources
they
are
often
copyrighted
or
protected
by
database
rights
many
of
the
departments
which
produce
them
attempt
to
make
a
profit
or
at
least
to
recover
their
entire
operating
costs
through
user
fees
it
is
heresy
to
suggest
that
the
taxpayer
has
already
paid
for
the
production
of
this
data
and
should
not
have
to
do
so
twice
the
other
part
of
the
world
practices
a
benign
form
of
information
socialism
by
law
any
text
produced
by
the
central
government
is
free
from
copyright
and
passes
immediately
into
the
public
domain
the
basic
norm
is
that
public
data
flows
should
be
available
at
the
cost
of
reproduction
alone
it
is
easy
to
guess
which
area
is
which
the
united
states
is
surely
the
profit
and
realm
europe
the
place
where
the
state
takes
pride
in
providing
data
as
a
public
service
no
actually
it
is
the
other
way
around
take
weather
data
the
united
states
makes
complete
weather
data
available
to
all
at
the
cost
of
reproduction
if
the
superb
government
web
sites
and
data
feeds
are
insufficient
for
the
cost
of
a
box
of
blank
dvds
you
can
have
the
entire
history
of
weather
records
across
the
continental
united
states
european
countries
by
contrast
typically
claim
government
copyright
over
weather
data
and
often
require
the
payment
of
substantial
fees
which
approach
is
better
i
have
been
studying
the
issue
for
fifteen
years
and
if
i
had
to
suggest
a
single
article
it
would
be
the
magisterial
study
by
peter
weiss
called
borders
in
cyberspace
published
by
the
national
academies
of
weiss
shows
that
the
approach
generates
far
more
social
wealth
true
the
information
is
initially
provided
for
free
but
a
thriving
private
weather
industry
has
sprung
up
which
takes
the
publicly
funded
data
as
its
raw
material
and
then
adds
value
to
it
the
weather
risk
management
industry
for
example
is
more
than
ten
times
bigger
than
the
european
one
employing
more
people
producing
more
valuable
products
generating
more
social
wealth
another
study
estimates
that
europe
invests
billion
euros
in
weather
data
and
gets
approximately
billion
back
in
economic
value
in
everything
from
more
efficient
farming
and
construction
decisions
to
better
holiday
planning
a
sevenfold
multiplier
the
united
states
by
contrast
invests
twice
as
much
billion
but
gets
back
a
return
of
billion
euros
a
multiplier
other
studies
suggest
similar
patterns
elsewhere
in
areas
ranging
from
geospatial
data
to
traffic
patterns
and
agriculture
the
free
information
flow
is
better
at
priming
the
pump
of
economic
activity
some
readers
may
not
thrill
to
this
way
of
looking
at
things
because
it
smacks
of
private
corporations
getting
a
free
ride
on
the
public
purse
social
wealth
be
damned
but
the
benefits
of
open
data
policies
go
further
every
year
the
monsoon
season
kills
hundreds
and
causes
massive
property
damage
in
southeast
asia
one
set
of
monsoon
rains
alone
killed
people
in
india
and
left
million
homeless
researchers
seeking
to
predict
the
monsoon
sought
complete
weather
records
from
the
united
states
and
europe
so
as
to
generate
a
model
based
on
global
weather
patterns
the
data
was
easily
and
cheaply
available
at
the
cost
of
reproduction
the
researchers
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
price
asked
by
the
european
weather
services
precluding
the
ensemble
analysis
they
sought
to
do
weiss
asks
rhetorically
what
is
the
economic
and
social
harm
to
over
billion
people
from
hampered
research
in
the
wake
of
the
outpouring
of
sympathy
for
tsunami
victims
in
the
same
region
this
example
seems
somehow
even
more
tragic
will
the
pattern
be
repeated
with
seismographic
cartographic
and
satellite
data
one
hopes
not
the
european
attitude
may
be
changing
competition
policy
has
already
been
a
powerful
force
in
pushing
countries
to
rethink
their
attitudes
to
government
data
the
european
directive
on
the
reuse
of
public
sector
information
takes
large
strides
in
the
right
direction
as
do
studies
by
the
organization
for
economic
and
development
oecd
and
several
national
unfortunately
though
most
of
these
follow
the
same
pattern
an
initially
strong
draft
is
watered
down
and
the
utterly
crucial
question
of
whether
data
should
be
provided
at
the
marginal
cost
of
reproduction
is
fudged
or
avoided
this
is
a
shame
again
if
we
really
believed
in
policy
making
the
debate
would
be
very
different
breaking
the
deal
what
would
the
debate
look
like
if
we
took
some
of
the
steps
i
mention
here
unfortunately
there
are
very
few
examples
of
policy
making
but
the
few
that
do
exist
are
striking
in
the
gowers
review
of
intellectual
property
policy
in
the
united
kingdom
considered
a
number
of
proposals
on
changes
to
copyright
law
including
a
retrospective
extension
of
sound
recording
copyright
the
copyright
term
for
sound
recordings
in
the
united
kingdom
is
fifty
years
it
is
longer
for
compositions
at
the
end
of
the
period
the
recording
enters
the
public
domain
if
the
composition
is
also
in
the
public
domain
the
great
orchestral
works
of
beethoven
brahms
and
mozart
for
example
or
the
jazz
classics
of
the
early
twentieth
century
then
anyone
can
copy
the
recording
this
means
we
could
make
it
freely
available
in
an
online
repository
for
music
students
throughout
britain
perhaps
preparing
the
next
generation
of
performers
or
republish
it
in
a
digitally
cleansed
and
enhanced
edition
if
the
composition
is
still
under
copyright
as
with
much
popular
music
then
the
composer
is
still
entitled
to
a
licensing
fee
but
now
any
music
publisher
who
pays
that
fee
can
reissue
the
work
introducing
competition
and
presumably
bringing
down
prices
of
the
recording
the
recording
industry
along
with
successful
artists
such
as
sir
cliff
richard
and
ian
anderson
of
jethro
tull
wished
to
extend
the
term
to
years
or
perhaps
even
longer
the
life
of
the
performer
plus
seventy
years
this
proposal
was
not
just
for
new
recordings
but
for
the
ones
that
have
already
been
made
think
of
the
copyright
system
as
offering
a
deal
to
artists
and
record
companies
we
will
enlist
the
force
of
the
state
to
give
you
fifty
years
of
monopoly
over
your
recordings
during
that
time
you
will
have
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute
and
reproduce
your
recording
after
that
time
it
is
available
to
all
just
as
you
benefited
from
the
availability
of
public
domain
works
from
your
predecessors
will
you
make
records
under
these
terms
obviously
fifty
years
of
legalized
exclusivity
was
enough
of
an
incentive
to
get
them
to
make
the
music
in
the
first
place
we
have
the
unimpeachable
evidence
that
they
actually
did
now
they
want
to
change
the
terms
of
the
deal
retrospectively
they
say
this
will
harmonize
the
law
internationally
give
recordings
the
same
treatment
as
compositions
help
struggling
musicians
and
give
the
recording
industry
some
extra
money
that
it
might
spend
on
developing
new
talent
or
on
porsches
shareholder
dividends
and
plastic
ducks
if
you
give
me
another
years
of
monopoly
rent
i
can
spend
it
as
i
wish
change
the
context
and
think
about
how
you
would
react
to
this
if
the
deal
was
presented
to
you
personally
you
hired
an
artist
to
paint
a
portrait
you
offered
he
agreed
you
had
a
deal
he
painted
the
painting
you
liked
it
you
gave
him
the
money
a
few
years
later
he
returned
you
owe
me
another
he
said
you
both
looked
at
the
contract
but
you
agreed
to
paint
it
for
and
i
paid
you
that
amount
he
admitted
this
was
true
but
pointed
out
that
painters
in
other
countries
sometimes
received
higher
amounts
as
did
sculptors
in
our
own
country
in
fact
he
told
you
all
painters
in
our
country
planned
to
demand
another
for
each
picture
they
had
already
painted
as
well
as
for
future
pictures
this
would
harmonize
our
prices
with
other
countries
put
painting
on
the
same
footing
as
sculpture
and
enable
painters
to
hire
more
apprentices
his
other
argument
was
that
painters
often
lost
money
only
changing
the
terms
of
their
deals
long
after
they
were
struck
could
keep
them
in
business
paying
the
money
was
your
duty
if
you
did
not
pay
it
meant
that
you
did
not
respect
art
and
private
property
you
would
find
these
arguments
absurd
yet
they
are
the
same
ones
the
record
industry
used
relying
heavily
on
the
confusions
against
which
this
book
has
warned
is
the
record
idea
as
outrageous
as
the
demands
of
my
imaginary
painter
it
is
actually
worse
the
majority
of
sound
recordings
made
more
than
forty
years
ago
are
commercially
unavailable
after
fifty
years
only
a
tiny
percentage
are
still
being
sold
it
is
extremely
hard
to
find
the
copyright
holders
of
the
remainder
they
might
have
died
gone
out
of
business
or
simply
stopped
caring
even
if
the
composer
can
be
found
or
paid
through
a
collection
society
without
the
consent
of
the
holder
of
the
copyright
over
the
musical
recording
the
work
must
stay
in
the
library
these
are
orphan
works
a
category
that
probably
comprises
the
majority
of
cultural
artifacts
yet
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
without
the
copyright
permission
it
is
illegal
to
copy
or
redistribute
or
perform
these
works
even
if
it
is
done
on
a
nonprofit
basis
the
goal
of
copyright
is
to
encourage
the
production
of
and
public
access
to
cultural
works
it
has
done
its
job
in
encouraging
production
now
it
operates
as
a
fence
to
discourage
access
as
the
years
go
by
we
continue
to
lock
up
percent
of
our
recorded
culture
from
a
particular
year
in
order
to
benefit
an
percentage
the
lottery
winners
in
a
grotesquely
inefficient
cultural
policy
finally
fifty
years
after
they
were
made
sound
recordings
enter
the
public
domain
in
the
united
kingdom
though
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
licensing
fees
would
still
be
due
to
the
composer
if
the
work
itself
was
still
under
copyright
now
anyone
individual
company
specialist
in
public
domain
material
could
offer
the
work
to
the
public
but
not
if
the
record
companies
can
persuade
the
government
otherwise
like
my
imaginary
painter
they
want
to
change
the
terms
of
the
deal
retrospectively
but
at
least
the
painter
proposal
would
not
make
the
vast
majority
of
paintings
unavailable
just
to
benefit
a
tiny
minority
of
current
artists
the
recording
industry
proposal
for
retrospective
extension
was
effectively
a
tax
on
the
british
public
to
benefit
the
copyright
holders
of
a
tiny
proportion
of
sound
recordings
the
public
loses
three
times
it
loses
first
when
it
is
forced
to
continue
to
pay
monopoly
prices
for
older
commercially
available
music
rather
than
getting
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
british
legislators
originally
offered
fifty
years
of
exclusivity
then
the
public
domain
the
public
loses
a
second
time
when
as
a
side
effect
it
is
denied
access
to
commercially
unavailable
music
no
library
or
niche
publisher
can
make
the
forgotten
recordings
available
again
finally
the
public
loses
a
third
time
because
allowing
retrospective
extensions
will
distort
the
political
process
in
the
future
leading
to
an
almost
inevitable
legislative
capture
by
the
tiny
minority
who
find
that
their
work
still
has
commercial
value
at
the
end
of
the
copyright
term
they
were
originally
granted
as
larry
lessig
has
pointed
out
repeatedly
the
time
to
have
the
debate
about
the
length
of
the
copyright
term
is
before
we
know
whose
works
will
survive
commercially
the
whole
idea
is
very
silly
but
if
this
is
the
silly
idea
we
wish
to
pursue
then
simply
increase
the
income
tax
proportionately
and
distribute
the
benefits
to
those
record
companies
and
musicians
whose
music
is
still
commercially
available
after
fifty
years
require
them
to
put
the
money
into
developing
new
artists
something
the
current
proposal
does
not
do
let
all
the
other
recordings
pass
into
the
public
domain
of
course
no
government
would
consider
such
an
idea
for
a
moment
tax
the
public
to
give
a
monopoly
windfall
to
those
who
already
hit
the
jackpot
because
they
claim
their
industry
can
not
survive
without
retrospectively
changing
the
terms
of
its
deals
it
is
indeed
laughable
yet
it
is
a
far
better
proposal
than
the
one
that
was
presented
to
the
gowers
review
what
happened
next
was
instructive
the
review
commissioned
an
economic
study
of
the
effects
of
copyright
term
extension
both
prospective
and
retrospective
on
recorded
music
from
the
university
of
cambridge
centre
for
intellectual
property
and
information
law
the
resulting
document
was
a
model
of
its
with
painstaking
care
and
a
real
if
sometimes
fruitless
attempt
to
make
economic
arguments
accessible
to
ordinary
human
beings
the
study
laid
out
the
costs
and
benefits
of
extending
the
copyright
term
over
sound
recordings
it
pointed
out
that
the
time
to
measure
the
value
of
a
prospective
term
extension
is
at
the
moment
the
copyright
is
granted
only
then
does
it
produce
its
incentive
effects
the
question
one
must
ask
is
how
much
value
today
does
it
give
an
artist
or
record
company
to
have
their
copyright
extended
by
a
year
at
the
end
of
the
existing
period
of
protection
then
one
must
look
to
see
whether
the
benefits
of
the
added
incentive
outweigh
the
social
costs
it
imposes
to
put
it
another
way
if
the
state
were
selling
today
the
rights
to
have
protection
from
year
fifty
to
year
five
how
much
would
a
rational
copyright
holder
pay
particularly
knowing
that
there
is
only
a
small
likelihood
the
work
will
even
be
commercially
available
to
take
advantage
of
the
extension
would
that
amount
be
greater
than
the
losses
imposed
on
society
by
extending
the
right
obviously
the
value
of
the
extension
is
affected
by
our
discount
rate
the
annual
amount
by
which
we
must
discount
a
pound
sterling
in
royalties
i
will
not
receive
for
years
in
order
to
find
its
value
now
unsurprisingly
one
finds
that
the
value
of
that
pound
in
the
future
is
tiny
at
the
moment
when
it
matters
today
in
the
calculation
of
an
artist
or
distributor
making
the
decision
whether
to
create
conservative
estimates
yield
a
present
value
between
percent
and
percent
of
the
eventual
amount
by
that
analysis
a
pound
in
fifty
years
is
worth
between
three
and
nine
pence
to
you
today
while
other
estimates
have
the
value
falling
below
one
penny
this
seems
unlikely
to
spur
much
creativity
at
the
margin
or
to
put
it
in
the
more
elegant
language
of
macaulay
quoted
in
chapter
i
will
take
an
example
johnson
died
years
ago
if
the
law
were
what
my
honourable
and
learned
friend
wishes
to
make
it
somebody
would
now
have
the
monopoly
of
johnson
works
who
that
somebody
would
be
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
we
may
venture
to
guess
i
guess
then
that
it
would
have
been
some
bookseller
who
was
the
assign
of
another
bookseller
who
was
the
grandson
of
a
third
bookseller
who
had
bought
the
copyright
from
black
frank
the
doctor
servant
and
residuary
legatee
in
or
now
would
the
knowledge
that
this
copyright
would
exist
in
have
been
a
source
of
gratification
to
johnson
would
it
have
stimulated
his
exertions
would
it
have
once
drawn
him
out
of
his
bed
before
noon
would
it
have
once
cheered
him
under
a
fit
of
the
spleen
would
it
have
induced
him
to
give
us
one
more
allegory
one
more
life
of
a
poet
one
more
imitation
of
juvenal
i
firmly
believe
not
i
firmly
believe
that
a
hundred
years
ago
when
he
was
writing
our
debates
for
the
gentleman
magazine
he
would
very
much
rather
have
had
twopence
to
buy
a
plate
of
shin
of
beef
at
a
cook
shop
the
art
form
is
different
but
the
thought
of
a
cliff
richard
or
ian
anderson
being
cheered
under
a
fit
of
the
spleen
by
the
prospect
of
a
copyright
extension
fifty
years
hence
is
truly
a
lovely
one
considering
all
these
factors
as
well
as
the
effects
on
investment
in
british
versus
american
music
and
on
the
balance
of
trade
the
cambridge
study
found
that
the
extension
would
cost
consumers
between
and
million
pounds
far
more
than
the
benefits
to
performers
and
recording
studios
in
practice
the
report
suggested
without
changes
in
the
law
most
of
the
benefits
would
not
have
gone
to
the
original
recording
artist
in
any
case
it
found
prospective
extension
led
to
a
clear
social
welfare
loss
what
of
retrospective
extension
the
report
considered
and
found
wanting
arguments
that
retrospective
extension
is
necessary
to
encourage
media
migration
the
digitization
of
existing
works
for
example
in
fact
most
studies
have
found
precisely
the
reverse
that
public
domain
works
are
more
available
and
more
frequently
adapted
into
different
media
look
on
for
a
classic
work
that
is
out
of
copyright
for
example
and
see
how
many
adaptations
and
formats
are
available
it
also
rejected
the
argument
that
harmonization
alone
was
enough
to
justify
extension
retrospective
or
prospective
pointing
out
the
considerable
actual
variation
in
both
term
and
scope
of
rights
afforded
to
performers
in
different
countries
finally
it
warned
of
the
hidden
effect
of
harmonisation
which
results
from
the
fact
that
harmonisation
is
almost
invariably
upwards
its
conclusion
was
simple
r
etrospective
term
extensions
reduce
social
welfare
thus
in
this
case
it
would
seem
that
basic
theory
alone
is
sufficient
to
provide
strong
and
unambiguous
guidance
for
we
therefore
see
no
reason
to
quarrel
with
the
consensus
of
the
profession
on
this
issue
which
as
summed
up
by
akerlof
et
al
states
categorically
that
retrospective
extension
provides
essentially
no
incentive
to
create
new
works
once
a
work
is
created
additional
compensation
to
the
producer
is
simply
a
windfall
the
gowers
review
agreed
its
fourth
recommendation
read
simply
policy
makers
should
adopt
the
principle
that
the
term
and
scope
of
protection
for
ip
rights
should
not
be
altered
retrospectively
perhaps
more
important
though
was
the
simple
paragraph
at
the
front
of
the
document
captioned
the
approach
of
the
review
it
begins
thus
the
review
takes
an
based
approach
to
its
policy
analysis
and
has
supplemented
internal
analysis
by
commissioning
external
experts
to
examine
the
economic
impact
of
changes
why
specify
that
one
was
taking
an
approach
at
first
the
comment
seems
unnecessary
what
other
approach
would
one
take
anecdotal
astrological
but
there
is
a
framework
in
which
empirical
evidence
of
the
effects
of
policy
simply
seems
irrelevant
one
based
on
natural
right
when
the
review
was
given
to
the
house
of
commons
select
committee
on
culture
media
and
sport
that
frame
of
mind
was
much
in
evidence
the
gowers
review
undertook
an
extensive
analysis
of
the
argument
for
extending
the
term
on
economic
grounds
the
review
concluded
that
there
was
little
evidence
that
extension
would
benefit
performers
increase
the
number
of
works
created
or
made
available
or
provide
incentives
for
creativity
and
it
noted
a
potentially
negative
effect
on
the
balance
of
trade
gowers
analysis
was
thorough
and
in
economic
terms
may
be
correct
it
gives
the
impression
however
of
having
been
conducted
entirely
on
economic
grounds
we
strongly
believe
that
copyright
represents
a
moral
right
of
a
creator
to
choose
to
retain
ownership
and
control
of
their
own
intellectual
property
we
have
not
heard
a
convincing
reason
why
a
composer
and
his
or
her
heirs
should
benefit
from
a
term
of
copyright
which
extends
for
lifetime
and
beyond
but
a
performer
should
not
given
the
strength
and
importance
of
the
creative
industries
in
the
it
seems
extraordinary
that
the
protection
of
intellectual
property
rights
should
be
weaker
here
than
in
many
other
countries
whose
creative
industries
are
less
a
couple
of
things
are
worth
noting
here
the
first
is
that
the
committee
is
quite
prepared
to
believe
that
the
effects
of
term
extension
would
not
benefit
performers
or
provide
incentives
for
creativity
and
even
to
believe
that
it
would
hurt
the
balance
of
trade
the
second
is
the
curious
argument
in
the
last
sentence
other
countries
have
stronger
systems
of
rights
and
are
less
successful
we
should
change
our
regime
to
be
more
like
them
obviously
the
idea
that
a
country
creative
industries
might
be
less
successful
because
their
systems
of
rights
were
stronger
does
not
occur
to
the
committee
for
a
moment
though
it
proclaims
itself
to
be
unaffected
by
economic
thought
it
is
in
fact
deeply
influenced
by
the
more
rights
equals
more
innovation
ideology
of
maximalism
that
i
have
described
in
these
pages
nestling
between
these
two
apparently
contradictory
ideas
is
a
serious
argument
that
needs
to
be
confronted
should
we
ignore
evidence
even
conclusive
evidence
of
negative
economic
effects
harm
to
consumers
and
consequences
for
the
availability
of
culture
because
we
are
dealing
with
an
issue
of
moral
right
almost
natural
right
must
we
extend
the
rights
of
the
artists
who
recorded
those
songs
or
rather
the
record
companies
who
immediately
acquired
their
copyrights
because
they
are
simply
theirs
as
a
matter
of
natural
justice
do
performers
have
a
natural
right
to
recorded
songs
either
because
they
have
labored
on
them
mixing
their
sweat
with
each
track
or
because
something
of
their
personality
is
forever
stamped
into
the
song
must
we
grant
an
additional
years
of
commercial
exclusivity
not
because
of
economic
incentive
but
because
of
natural
right
most
of
us
feel
the
pull
of
this
argument
i
certainly
do
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
chapter
there
are
considerable
problems
with
such
an
idea
first
it
runs
against
the
premises
of
actual
copyright
systems
in
the
united
states
for
example
the
constitution
resolutely
presents
the
opposite
picture
exclusive
rights
are
to
encourage
progress
in
science
and
the
useful
arts
the
supreme
court
has
elaborated
on
this
point
many
times
rejecting
both
sweat
of
the
brow
theories
of
copyright
and
more
expansive
visions
based
on
a
natural
right
to
the
products
of
one
genius
whether
inventions
or
novels
britain
too
has
a
history
of
looking
to
copyright
as
a
utilitarian
scheme
though
with
more
reference
to
and
legal
protection
of
particular
moral
rights
than
one
finds
in
the
united
states
but
even
in
the
most
expansive
moral
rights
legal
systems
even
in
the
early
days
of
debate
about
the
rights
of
authors
after
the
french
revolution
it
is
accepted
that
there
are
temporal
limits
on
these
rights
if
this
is
true
of
authors
it
is
even
more
true
of
performers
who
are
not
granted
the
full
suite
of
author
rights
in
moral
rights
jurisdictions
being
exiled
to
a
form
of
protection
called
neighboring
rights
in
all
of
these
schemes
there
are
time
limits
on
the
length
of
the
rights
and
frequently
different
ones
for
different
creators
authors
inventors
performers
and
so
on
once
one
has
accepted
that
point
the
question
of
how
long
they
should
be
is
surely
a
matter
for
empirical
and
utilitarian
analysis
one
can
not
credibly
say
that
natural
rights
or
the
deep
deontological
structure
of
the
universe
gives
me
a
right
to
or
or
seventy
years
of
exclusivity
the
argument
must
turn
instead
to
a
question
of
consequences
which
limit
is
better
once
one
asks
that
question
the
gowers
review
economic
assessment
is
overwhelming
as
the
select
committee
itself
recognized
in
the
end
the
government
agreed
noting
that
a
european
union
study
had
found
precisely
the
same
thing
the
sound
recording
right
should
not
be
extended
still
less
extended
retrospectively
the
zone
had
been
penetrated
but
not
for
long
as
this
book
went
to
press
the
european
commission
announced
its
support
for
an
even
longer
extension
of
the
sound
recording
right
the
contrary
arguments
and
empirical
evidence
were
ignored
minimized
explained
away
how
can
this
pattern
be
broken
in
the
next
and
final
chapter
i
try
to
answer
that
question
i
offer
a
partial
explanation
for
the
cognitive
and
organizational
blindnesses
that
have
brought
us
to
this
point
i
argue
that
we
have
much
to
learn
from
the
history
theory
and
organizational
practices
of
the
environmental
movement
the
environmental
movement
taught
us
to
see
the
environment
for
the
first
time
to
recognize
its
importance
and
to
change
the
way
we
thought
about
ecology
property
and
economics
in
consequence
what
we
need
is
an
environmentalism
of
mind
of
culture
of
information
in
the
words
of
my
colleague
david
lange
we
need
to
recognize
the
public
domain
and
to
save
it
chapter
an
environmentalism
for
information
over
the
last
fifteen
years
a
group
of
scholars
have
finally
persuaded
economists
to
believe
something
noneconomists
find
obvious
behavioral
economics
shows
that
people
do
not
act
as
economic
theory
predicts
but
hold
your
cheers
this
is
not
a
vindication
of
folk
wisdom
over
the
the
deviations
from
rational
behavior
are
not
the
wonderful
cornucopia
of
human
motivations
you
might
imagine
there
are
patterns
for
example
we
are
systematically
likely
to
overestimate
chances
of
loss
and
underestimate
chances
of
gain
to
rely
on
simplifying
heuristics
to
frame
problems
even
when
those
heuristics
are
contradicted
by
the
facts
some
of
the
patterns
are
endearing
the
supposedly
irrational
concerns
for
distributive
equality
that
persist
in
all
but
the
economically
trained
and
the
extreme
right
for
example
but
most
of
them
simply
involve
the
mapping
of
cognitive
bias
we
can
take
advantage
of
those
biases
as
those
who
sell
us
ludicrously
expensive
and
irrational
warranties
on
consumer
goods
do
or
we
can
correct
for
them
like
a
pilot
who
is
trained
to
rely
on
his
instruments
rather
than
his
faulty
perceptions
when
flying
in
heavy
cloud
this
book
has
introduced
you
to
the
wonders
and
terrors
of
intellectual
property
law
the
range
wars
of
the
internet
age
there
have
been
discussions
of
synthetic
biology
and
musical
sampling
digital
locks
and
the
hackers
who
break
them
jefferson
and
macaulay
and
the
fight
over
video
recorders
now
it
is
time
to
sum
up
i
would
argue
that
the
chapters
in
this
book
present
evidence
of
another
kind
of
cognitive
bias
one
that
the
behavioral
economists
have
not
yet
identified
call
it
the
openness
aversion
cultural
agoraphobia
we
are
systematically
likely
to
undervalue
the
importance
viability
and
productive
power
of
open
systems
open
networks
and
nonproprietary
production
cultural
agoraphobia
test
yourself
on
the
following
questions
in
each
case
it
is
and
i
have
removed
from
you
all
knowledge
of
the
years
since
then
for
some
this
might
be
a
relief
the
first
question
is
a
thought
experiment
i
introduced
in
chapter
you
have
to
design
an
international
computer
network
one
group
of
scientists
describes
a
system
that
is
fundamentally
open
open
protocols
and
open
systems
so
that
anyone
could
connect
to
the
system
and
offer
information
or
products
to
the
world
another
group
scholars
businesspeople
bureaucrats
points
out
the
problems
anyone
could
connect
to
the
system
they
could
do
anything
the
system
itself
would
not
limit
them
to
a
few
approved
actions
or
approved
connections
there
would
be
porn
and
piracy
and
viruses
and
spam
terrorists
could
put
up
videos
glorifying
themselves
your
neighbor
site
could
compete
with
the
new
york
times
or
the
government
in
documenting
the
war
in
iraq
better
to
have
a
system
in
which
official
approval
is
required
to
put
up
a
site
where
only
a
few
selected
actions
are
permitted
by
the
network
protocols
where
most
of
us
are
merely
recipients
of
information
where
spam
viruses
and
piracy
and
innovation
and
participatory
culture
and
anonymous
speech
are
impossible
which
network
design
would
you
have
picked
remember
you
have
no
experience
of
blogs
or
mashups
or
google
no
experience
of
the
web
just
you
and
your
cognitive
filters
imagine
a
form
of
software
which
anyone
could
copy
and
change
created
under
a
license
which
required
subsequent
programmers
to
offer
their
software
on
the
same
terms
imagine
legions
of
programmers
worldwide
contributing
their
creations
back
into
a
commons
is
this
method
of
production
economically
viable
could
it
successfully
compete
with
the
hierarchically
organized
corporations
producing
proprietary
closed
code
controlled
by
both
law
and
technology
be
truthful
finally
set
yourself
the
task
of
producing
the
greatest
reference
work
the
world
has
ever
seen
you
are
told
that
it
must
cover
everything
from
the
best
thai
food
in
durham
to
the
annual
rice
production
of
thailand
from
the
best
places
to
see
blue
whales
to
the
history
of
the
blue
dog
coalition
would
you
create
a
massive
organization
of
paid
experts
each
assigned
a
topic
with
hierarchical
layers
of
editors
above
them
producing
a
set
of
encyclopedic
tomes
that
are
rigorously
controlled
by
copyright
and
trademark
or
would
you
wait
for
hobbyists
governments
scientists
and
volunteer
encyclopedists
to
produce
and
search
engines
to
organize
and
rank
a
cornucopia
of
information
i
know
which
way
i
would
have
bet
in
but
i
also
know
that
the
last
time
i
consulted
an
encyclopedia
was
in
you
it
is
not
that
openness
is
always
right
it
is
not
often
we
need
strong
intellectual
property
rights
privacy
controls
and
networks
that
demand
authentication
rather
it
is
that
we
need
a
balance
between
open
and
closed
owned
and
free
and
we
are
systematically
likely
to
get
the
balance
wrong
how
did
you
do
on
the
test
partly
this
is
because
we
still
do
understand
the
kind
of
property
that
lives
on
networks
most
of
our
experience
is
with
tangible
property
sandwiches
that
one
hundred
people
can
not
share
fields
that
can
be
overgrazed
if
outsiders
can
not
be
excluded
for
that
kind
of
property
control
makes
more
sense
like
astronauts
brought
up
in
gravity
our
reflexes
are
poorly
suited
for
free
fall
jefferson
words
were
true
even
of
grain
elevators
and
but
in
our
world
the
proportion
of
intangible
to
tangible
property
is
much
much
higher
the
tendency
to
conflate
intellectual
and
real
property
is
even
more
dangerous
in
a
networked
world
we
need
his
words
more
than
he
did
each
of
the
questions
i
asked
is
related
to
the
world
wide
web
not
the
internet
the
collective
name
for
the
whole
phenomenon
including
the
underlying
methods
of
sending
and
receiving
packets
some
version
of
the
underlying
network
has
been
around
for
much
longer
in
one
form
or
another
but
it
only
attracted
popular
attention
only
revolutionized
the
world
when
on
top
of
it
was
built
the
world
wide
web
the
network
of
protocols
and
pages
and
hyperlinks
that
is
so
much
a
part
of
our
lives
and
which
arose
only
from
tim
work
at
cern
in
my
daughter
will
graduate
from
college
in
the
year
at
least
we
both
hope
so
she
is
older
than
the
web
it
will
not
even
have
had
its
twentieth
birthday
on
her
graduation
day
by
christmas
of
it
will
be
able
to
drink
legally
in
the
united
states
i
wrote
those
sentences
but
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
them
myself
a
life
without
the
web
is
easy
to
remember
and
yet
hard
to
recapture
fully
it
seems
like
such
a
natural
part
of
our
world
too
fixed
to
have
been
such
a
recent
arrival
as
if
someone
suggested
that
all
the
roads
and
buildings
around
you
had
arrived
in
the
last
fifteen
years
some
of
you
may
find
these
words
inexplicable
because
you
live
in
a
happy
bliss
free
of
any
contact
with
computer
networks
if
so
i
take
my
hat
off
to
you
the
world
of
open
sky
and
virtuous
sweat
of
books
and
sport
and
laughter
is
no
less
dear
to
me
than
to
you
having
an
avatar
in
a
virtual
world
holds
the
same
interest
as
elective
dental
surgery
i
care
about
the
web
not
because
i
want
to
live
my
life
there
but
because
of
what
it
has
allowed
us
to
achieve
what
it
represents
for
the
potential
of
open
science
and
culture
that
i
think
is
something
that
thoreau
and
even
emerson
for
that
matter
might
have
cared
about
deeply
yet
as
i
suggested
earlier
in
this
book
i
seriously
doubt
that
we
would
create
the
web
today
at
least
if
policy
makers
and
market
incumbents
understood
what
the
technology
might
become
early
enough
to
stop
it
i
am
not
postulating
some
sinister
breakages
limited
that
stifles
technological
innovation
i
am
merely
pointing
out
the
imbalance
between
our
intuitive
perceptions
of
the
virtues
and
dangers
of
open
and
closed
systems
an
imbalance
i
share
quite
frankly
in
place
of
what
we
have
today
i
think
we
would
try
indeed
we
are
trying
to
reinvent
a
tamer
more
controlled
web
and
to
change
the
nature
of
the
underlying
network
on
which
it
operates
this
is
a
fear
i
share
with
those
who
have
written
about
it
more
eloquently
than
i
particularly
larry
lessig
and
yochai
benkler
we
would
restrict
openness
of
access
decrease
anonymity
and
limit
the
number
of
actions
that
a
network
participant
could
perform
the
benefits
would
be
undeniable
it
would
cut
down
on
spam
viruses
and
illicit
file
sharing
at
the
same
time
it
would
undercut
the
iconoclastic
technological
cultural
and
political
potential
that
the
web
offers
the
ability
of
a
new
technology
a
new
service
to
build
on
open
networks
and
open
protocols
without
needing
approval
from
regulators
or
entrenched
market
players
or
even
the
owners
of
the
web
pages
to
which
you
link
imagine
by
contrast
an
internet
and
a
world
wide
web
that
looked
like
america
online
circa
or
compuserve
or
the
french
state
network
minitel
true
your
exposure
to
enhancement
techniques
misspelled
stock
tips
and
the
penniless
sons
of
nigerian
oil
ministers
would
be
reduced
that
sounds
pretty
attractive
but
the
idea
that
the
aol
search
engine
would
be
replaced
by
yahoo
and
then
google
let
alone
google
maps
that
new
forms
of
instant
messaging
would
displace
that
the
chinese
dissident
would
have
access
to
anonymized
internet
services
that
you
might
make
phone
calls
worldwide
for
free
from
your
computer
or
that
a
blog
like
boingboing
would
end
up
having
more
page
views
than
many
major
newspapers
forget
it
goodbye
to
the
radical
idea
that
anyone
can
link
to
any
page
on
the
network
without
permission
a
revised
network
could
have
the
opposite
rule
and
even
impose
it
by
default
a
tamer
network
could
keep
much
tighter
control
over
content
particularly
copyrighted
content
you
might
still
get
the
video
of
the
gentlemen
doing
strange
things
with
mentos
and
soda
bottles
though
not
its
viral
method
of
distribution
but
forget
about
george
bush
does
care
about
black
people
and
all
your
favorite
mashups
its
controlled
network
of
links
and
its
limited
access
would
never
unleash
the
collective
genius
the
web
has
shown
for
a
fee
you
would
have
microsoft
encarta
and
the
encyclopedia
britannica
online
what
about
the
universe
of
knowledge
about
the
world
gathered
by
strangers
shared
on
comparatively
open
sites
worldwide
and
ordered
by
search
engines
what
about
wikipedia
i
think
not
the
counterfactual
i
offer
is
not
merely
a
counterfactual
yes
we
got
the
web
it
spread
too
fast
to
think
of
taming
it
into
the
more
mature
sedate
national
information
infrastructure
that
the
clinton
administration
imagined
but
as
larry
lessig
pointed
out
years
ago
the
nature
of
a
network
can
always
be
changed
the
war
over
the
control
and
design
of
the
network
and
the
networked
computer
is
as
i
write
these
words
the
battles
are
over
trusted
computing
and
net
neutrality
trusted
computing
is
a
feature
built
into
the
operating
system
which
makes
it
impossible
to
run
processes
that
have
not
been
approved
by
some
outside
body
and
digitally
identified
it
would
indeed
help
to
safeguard
your
computer
from
viruses
and
other
threats
and
make
it
harder
to
copy
material
the
content
owners
did
not
want
you
to
copy
perhaps
even
if
you
had
a
right
to
in
the
process
it
would
help
to
lock
in
the
power
of
those
who
had
a
dominant
position
in
operating
systems
and
popular
programs
microsoft
is
a
big
supporter
it
would
make
open
source
software
which
allows
users
to
modify
programs
inherently
suspect
it
would
in
fact
as
jonathan
zittrain
points
out
change
the
nature
of
the
computer
which
you
can
program
to
do
anything
back
toward
the
terminal
which
tells
you
what
functions
are
think
of
a
dvd
player
the
attack
on
net
neutrality
by
contrast
is
an
attempt
by
the
companies
who
own
the
networks
to
be
allowed
to
discriminate
between
favored
and
disfavored
content
giving
the
former
preferential
access
one
wit
analogized
it
to
letting
the
phone
company
say
we
will
delay
your
call
to
pizza
hut
for
sixty
seconds
but
if
you
want
to
be
put
through
to
our
featured
pizza
provider
immediately
hit
nine
now
taken
together
these
proposals
would
put
the
control
of
the
computer
back
in
the
hands
of
the
owners
of
the
content
and
the
operating
system
and
control
of
the
network
users
choices
in
the
hands
of
the
person
who
sells
them
their
bandwidth
at
the
same
time
our
intellectual
property
agenda
is
filled
with
proposals
to
create
new
intellectual
property
rights
or
extend
old
ones
that
is
the
openness
aversion
in
action
now
perhaps
to
you
the
closed
alternatives
still
sound
better
perhaps
you
do
not
care
as
much
about
the
kind
of
technological
dynamism
or
anonymous
speech
or
cultural
ferment
that
thrills
the
digerati
perhaps
you
care
more
about
the
risks
posed
by
the
underlying
freedom
that
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
point
of
view
after
all
openness
does
present
real
dangers
the
same
freedom
given
to
the
innovator
the
artist
and
the
dissident
is
given
to
the
predator
and
the
criminal
at
each
moment
in
history
when
we
have
opened
a
communications
network
or
the
franchise
or
literacy
reasonable
people
have
worried
about
the
consequences
that
might
ensue
would
expanded
literacy
lead
to
a
general
coarsening
of
the
literary
imagination
sometimes
perhaps
but
it
would
and
did
lead
to
much
more
besides
to
literature
and
culture
of
which
we
could
not
have
dreamed
would
an
expanded
franchise
put
the
control
of
the
state
into
the
hands
of
the
uneducated
yes
unless
we
had
free
national
educational
systems
now
we
must
educate
our
masters
was
the
slogan
of
the
educational
reformers
after
the
enlargement
of
the
franchise
in
britain
in
the
nineteenth
century
openness
sometimes
begets
openness
would
translating
the
bible
from
latin
into
the
vernacular
open
the
door
to
unorthodox
and
heretical
interpretations
to
a
congregation
straying
because
they
did
not
need
to
depend
on
a
priestly
intermediary
with
privileged
access
to
the
text
oh
yes
indeed
would
tv
and
radio
play
into
the
hands
of
demagogues
yes
and
help
expose
their
misdeeds
openness
is
not
always
right
far
from
it
but
our
prior
experience
seems
to
be
that
we
are
systematically
better
at
seeing
its
dangers
than
its
benefits
this
book
has
been
an
attempt
in
the
sphere
of
intellectual
property
to
help
us
counteract
that
bias
like
the
pilot
in
the
cloud
looking
at
his
instruments
we
might
learn
that
we
are
upside
down
but
what
do
we
do
about
it
learning
from
environmentalism
i
have
argued
that
our
policies
are
distorted
not
merely
by
industry
capture
or
the
power
of
incumbent
firms
but
by
a
series
of
cultural
and
economic
biases
or
presuppositions
the
equation
of
intellectual
property
to
physical
property
the
assumption
that
whenever
value
is
created
an
intellectual
property
right
should
follow
the
romantic
idea
of
creativity
that
needs
no
raw
material
from
which
to
build
the
habit
of
considering
the
threats
but
not
the
benefits
of
new
technologies
the
notion
that
more
rights
will
automatically
bring
more
innovation
the
failure
to
realize
that
the
public
domain
is
a
vital
contributor
to
innovation
and
culture
and
a
tendency
to
see
the
dangers
of
openness
but
not
its
potential
one
of
the
most
stunning
pieces
of
evidence
to
our
aversion
to
openness
is
that
for
the
last
fifty
years
whenever
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
law
it
has
almost
always
been
to
expand
intellectual
property
rights
remember
this
implies
that
every
significant
change
in
technology
society
or
economy
required
more
rights
never
less
nor
even
the
same
amount
we
have
done
all
this
almost
entirely
in
the
absence
of
empirical
evidence
and
without
empirical
reconsideration
to
see
if
our
policies
were
working
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
last
chapter
intellectual
property
policy
is
an
zone
it
runs
on
faith
alone
and
its
faith
consists
of
the
cluster
of
ideas
i
have
outlined
in
this
book
whether
we
call
this
cluster
of
ideas
maximalism
cultural
agoraphobia
or
the
openness
aversion
it
exercises
a
profound
influence
on
our
intellectual
property
and
communications
policy
these
ideas
are
not
they
exist
within
are
influenced
by
and
in
turn
influence
a
political
economy
the
political
economy
matters
and
it
will
shape
any
viable
response
even
if
the
costs
of
getting
the
policies
wrong
are
huge
and
unnecessary
think
of
the
costs
of
the
copyright
extensions
that
lock
up
most
of
culture
in
order
to
protect
the
tiny
fraction
of
it
that
is
still
commercially
available
they
are
spread
out
over
the
entire
population
while
the
benefits
accrue
to
a
small
group
of
commercial
entities
that
deeply
and
sincerely
believe
in
the
maximalist
creed
this
pattern
of
diffuse
but
large
losses
and
concentrated
gains
is
as
mancur
olson
taught
us
a
recipe
for
political
yet
the
problem
is
even
deeper
than
that
in
four
ways
first
though
intellectual
property
rules
will
profoundly
shape
science
culture
and
the
market
in
the
information
age
they
just
seem
obscure
wonkish
hard
to
get
excited
about
certainly
people
can
get
upset
about
individual
examples
overbroad
patents
on
human
genes
copyright
lawsuits
against
whistleblowers
who
leak
showing
corporate
misdeeds
that
threaten
the
integrity
of
electronic
voting
rules
that
paralyze
documentary
filmmakers
or
require
payment
for
sampling
three
notes
from
a
prior
song
extensions
of
rights
that
allow
patents
on
auctions
or
business
methods
make
genres
such
as
jazz
seem
legally
problematic
create
new
rights
over
facts
or
snarl
up
foundational
technologies
but
they
see
each
of
these
as
an
isolated
malfunction
not
part
of
a
larger
social
problem
or
set
of
attitudes
second
what
holds
true
for
issues
also
holds
true
for
communities
what
links
the
person
writing
open
source
software
and
trying
to
negotiate
a
sea
of
software
patents
in
the
process
to
the
film
archivist
trying
to
stir
up
interest
in
all
the
wonderful
orphan
films
still
under
copyright
but
with
no
copyright
owner
we
can
find
before
they
molder
away
into
nitrate
dust
when
a
university
collaborates
with
google
to
digitize
books
in
their
collection
for
the
purposes
of
search
and
retrieval
even
if
only
a
tiny
portion
of
the
text
will
be
visible
for
any
work
still
under
copyright
does
it
sense
any
common
interest
with
the
synthetic
biologist
trying
to
create
the
biobricks
foundation
to
keep
open
the
foundational
elements
of
a
new
scientific
field
both
may
be
sued
for
their
efforts
one
connection
at
least
when
a
developing
nation
tries
to
make
use
of
the
explicit
flexibilities
built
into
international
trade
agreements
so
as
to
make
available
a
drug
to
its
population
through
a
process
of
compulsory
licensing
and
compensation
it
will
find
itself
pilloried
as
a
lawbreaker
though
it
is
not
or
punished
through
bilateral
agreements
will
that
process
form
any
common
interest
with
the
industries
in
the
united
states
who
chafe
at
the
way
that
current
intellectual
property
rules
enshrine
older
technologies
and
business
methods
and
give
them
the
protection
of
law
there
are
some
links
between
those
two
situations
will
the
parties
see
those
links
or
will
the
developing
world
negotiators
think
that
the
current
intellectual
property
rules
express
some
monolithic
western
set
of
interests
will
the
companies
think
this
is
just
an
issue
of
dumb
lawyers
failing
to
understand
technology
each
gap
in
understanding
of
common
interest
is
a
strike
against
an
effective
response
third
an
effective
political
response
would
actually
be
easier
if
our
current
rules
came
merely
from
the
relentless
pursuit
of
corporate
here
i
part
company
with
those
who
believe
that
is
simply
there
not
shaped
by
socially
constructed
ideas
attitudes
ideologies
or
biases
in
fact
the
openness
aversion
sometimes
obscures
as
well
as
the
public
interest
think
of
the
relentless
insistence
of
the
movie
companies
on
making
video
recorders
illegal
nor
does
the
framework
of
maximalism
help
if
our
goal
is
to
have
all
the
interested
economic
actors
in
the
room
when
policy
is
made
for
example
by
framing
issues
of
communications
policy
or
internet
regulation
as
questions
of
intellectual
property
we
automatically
privilege
one
set
of
interested
parties
content
owners
over
others
who
also
have
a
large
economic
stake
in
the
matter
fourth
and
finally
the
biggest
problem
is
that
even
if
one
could
overcome
the
problems
of
political
interest
or
ideological
the
answers
to
many
of
these
questions
require
balance
thought
and
empirical
evidence
all
qualities
markedly
missing
in
the
debate
if
the
answer
were
that
intellectual
property
rights
are
bad
then
forming
good
policy
would
be
easy
but
that
is
as
silly
and
an
idea
as
the
maximalist
one
i
have
been
criticizing
here
here
are
three
examples
drug
patents
do
help
produce
drugs
jettisoning
them
is
a
bad
idea
though
experimenting
with
additional
and
alternative
methods
of
encouraging
medical
innovation
is
a
very
good
one
i
believe
copyrights
over
literary
works
should
be
shorter
and
that
one
should
have
to
renew
them
after
years
something
that
about
percent
of
authors
and
publishers
will
not
do
if
prior
history
is
anything
to
go
by
i
think
that
would
give
ample
incentives
to
write
and
distribute
books
and
give
us
a
richer
more
accessible
culture
and
educational
system
to
boot
a
library
of
congress
where
you
truly
can
click
to
get
the
book
as
my
son
asked
me
to
do
years
ago
now
but
that
does
not
mean
that
i
wish
to
abolish
copyright
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
system
all
the
empirical
evidence
shows
that
protecting
compilations
of
facts
as
the
european
database
directive
does
has
been
a
profound
failure
as
a
policy
imposing
costs
on
consumers
without
encouraging
new
database
production
but
if
the
evidence
said
the
opposite
i
would
support
a
new
database
right
we
need
a
political
debate
about
intellectual
property
that
recognizes
these
that
does
not
impose
simplistic
solutions
that
looks
to
evidence
we
need
to
understand
the
delicate
and
subtle
balance
between
property
and
the
opposite
of
property
the
role
of
rights
but
also
of
the
public
domain
and
the
commons
building
a
theory
let
alone
a
movement
around
such
an
issue
is
hard
doing
so
when
we
lack
some
of
the
basic
theoretical
tools
and
vocabularies
is
daunting
we
do
not
even
have
a
robust
conception
of
the
public
domain
if
they
think
of
it
as
a
legal
issue
at
all
people
simply
think
of
it
as
whatever
is
left
over
after
an
endless
series
of
rights
have
been
carved
out
can
one
build
a
politics
to
protect
a
residue
so
we
have
at
least
four
problems
an
issue
that
is
perceived
as
obscure
affecting
scattered
groups
with
little
knowledge
of
each
other
interest
dominated
by
an
ideology
that
is
genuinely
believed
by
its
adherents
in
the
place
of
which
we
have
to
make
careful
balanced
empirically
grounded
suggestions
assume
for
a
moment
the
need
for
a
politics
of
intellectual
property
that
seeks
a
solution
to
these
four
problems
what
might
such
a
politics
look
like
i
have
argued
that
in
a
number
of
respects
the
politics
of
intellectual
property
and
the
public
domain
is
at
the
stage
that
the
american
environmental
movement
was
at
in
the
in
there
were
people
who
cared
strongly
about
issues
we
would
now
identify
as
environmental
supporters
of
the
park
system
and
birdwatchers
but
also
hunters
and
those
who
disdained
chemical
pesticides
in
growing
their
foods
in
the
world
of
intellectual
property
we
have
software
engineers
libraries
appropriationist
artists
parodists
biographers
and
biotech
researchers
in
the
and
we
had
flurries
of
outrage
over
particular
crises
burning
rivers
oil
spills
dreadful
smog
in
the
world
of
intellectual
property
we
have
the
kind
of
stories
i
have
tried
to
tell
here
lacking
however
is
a
general
framework
a
perception
of
common
interest
in
apparently
disparate
situations
crudely
speaking
the
environmental
movement
was
deeply
influenced
by
two
basic
analytical
frameworks
the
first
was
the
idea
of
ecology
the
fragile
complex
and
unpredictable
interconnections
between
living
systems
the
second
was
the
idea
of
welfare
economics
the
ways
in
which
markets
can
fail
to
make
activities
internalize
their
full
the
combination
of
the
two
ideas
yielded
a
powerful
and
disturbing
conclusion
markets
would
routinely
fail
to
make
activities
internalize
their
own
costs
particularly
their
own
environmental
costs
this
failure
would
routinely
disrupt
or
destroy
fragile
ecological
systems
with
unpredictable
ugly
dangerous
and
possibly
irreparable
consequences
these
two
types
of
analysis
pointed
to
a
general
interest
in
environmental
protection
and
thus
helped
to
build
a
large
constituency
which
supported
governmental
efforts
to
that
end
the
duck
hunter
preservation
of
wetlands
as
a
species
habitat
turns
out
to
have
wider
functions
in
the
prevention
of
erosion
and
the
maintenance
of
water
quality
the
decision
to
burn
coal
rather
than
natural
gas
for
power
generation
may
have
impacts
on
everything
from
forests
to
fisheries
the
attempt
to
reduce
greenhouse
gases
and
mitigate
the
damage
from
global
warming
cuts
across
every
aspect
of
the
economy
of
course
it
would
be
silly
to
think
that
environmental
policy
was
fueled
only
by
ideas
rather
than
more
immediate
desires
as
william
ruckelshaus
put
it
with
air
pollution
there
was
for
example
a
desire
of
the
people
living
in
denver
to
see
the
mountains
again
similarly
the
people
living
in
los
angeles
had
a
desire
to
see
one
another
funnily
enough
as
with
intellectual
property
changes
in
communications
technology
also
played
a
role
in
our
living
rooms
in
the
middle
sixties
black
and
white
television
went
out
and
color
television
came
in
we
have
only
begun
to
understand
some
of
the
impacts
of
television
on
our
lives
but
certainly
for
the
environmental
movement
it
was
a
bonanza
a
yellow
outfall
flowing
into
a
blue
river
does
not
have
anywhere
near
the
impact
on
black
and
white
television
that
it
has
on
color
television
neither
does
brown
smog
against
a
blue
sky
more
importantly
perhaps
the
technologically
fueled
deluge
of
information
whether
from
weather
satellites
or
computer
models
running
on
supercomputers
provided
some
of
the
evidence
that
eventually
started
to
build
a
consensus
around
the
seriousness
of
global
warming
despite
the
importance
of
these
other
factors
the
ideas
i
mentioned
ecology
and
welfare
economics
were
extremely
important
for
the
environmental
movement
they
helped
to
provide
its
agenda
its
rhetoric
and
the
perception
of
common
interest
underneath
its
coalition
politics
even
more
interestingly
for
my
purposes
those
ideas
which
began
as
inaccessible
scientific
or
economic
concepts
far
from
popular
discourse
were
brought
into
the
mainstream
of
american
politics
this
did
not
happen
easily
or
automatically
popularizing
complicated
ideas
is
hard
work
there
were
popular
books
television
discussions
documentaries
on
love
canal
or
the
california
kelp
beds
pieces
in
newspapers
and
pontificating
experts
on
tv
environmental
groups
both
shocking
and
staid
played
their
part
through
the
dramatic
theater
of
a
greenpeace
protest
or
the
tweedy
respectability
of
the
audubon
society
where
once
the
idea
of
the
environment
as
opposed
to
my
lake
say
was
seen
as
a
mere
abstraction
something
that
could
stand
against
the
concrete
benefits
brought
by
a
particular
piece
of
development
it
came
to
be
an
abstraction
with
both
the
force
of
law
and
of
popular
interest
behind
it
to
me
this
suggests
a
strategy
for
the
future
of
the
politics
of
intellectual
property
a
way
to
save
our
eroding
public
domain
in
both
areas
we
seem
to
have
the
same
recipe
for
failure
in
the
structure
of
the
process
democratic
decisions
are
made
badly
when
they
are
primarily
made
by
and
for
the
benefit
of
a
few
stakeholders
whether
industrialists
or
content
providers
this
effect
is
only
intensified
when
the
transaction
costs
of
identifying
and
resisting
the
change
are
high
think
of
the
costs
and
benefits
of
acid
power
generation
or
less
serious
but
surely
similar
in
form
the
costs
and
benefits
of
retrospectively
increasing
copyright
term
limits
on
works
for
which
the
copyright
had
already
expired
pulling
them
back
out
of
the
public
domain
there
are
obvious
benefits
to
the
heirs
and
assigns
of
authors
whose
copyright
has
expired
in
having
congress
put
the
fence
back
up
around
this
portion
of
the
intellectual
commons
there
are
clearly
some
costs
for
example
to
education
and
public
debate
in
not
having
multiple
competing
editions
of
these
works
but
these
costs
are
individually
small
and
have
few
obvious
stakeholders
to
represent
them
yet
as
i
have
tried
to
argue
here
beyond
the
failures
in
the
process
lie
failures
in
the
way
we
think
about
the
issues
the
environmental
movement
gained
much
of
its
persuasive
power
by
pointing
out
that
for
structural
reasons
we
were
likely
to
make
bad
environmental
decisions
a
legal
system
based
on
a
particular
notion
of
what
private
property
entailed
and
an
engineering
or
scientific
system
that
treated
the
world
as
a
simple
linearly
related
set
of
causes
and
effects
in
both
of
these
conceptual
systems
the
environment
actually
disappeared
there
was
no
place
for
it
in
the
analysis
small
surprise
then
that
we
did
not
preserve
it
very
well
i
have
argued
that
the
same
is
true
about
the
public
domain
the
confusions
against
which
the
jefferson
warning
cautions
the
of
a
model
of
property
rights
centered
on
an
original
author
and
the
political
blindness
to
the
importance
of
the
public
domain
as
a
whole
not
my
lake
but
the
environment
all
come
together
to
make
the
public
domain
disappear
first
in
concept
and
then
increasingly
as
a
reality
to
end
this
process
we
need
a
cultural
environmentalism
an
environmentalism
of
the
mind
and
over
the
last
ten
years
we
have
actually
begun
to
build
one
cultural
environmentalism
is
an
idea
an
intellectual
and
practical
movement
that
is
intended
to
be
a
solution
to
a
set
of
political
and
theoretical
problems
an
imbalance
in
the
way
we
make
intellectual
property
policy
a
legal
regime
that
has
adapted
poorly
to
the
transformation
that
technology
has
produced
in
the
scope
of
law
and
perhaps
most
importantly
a
set
of
mental
models
economic
nostrums
and
property
theories
that
each
have
a
public
hole
at
their
center
the
comparison
i
drew
between
the
history
of
environmentalism
and
the
state
of
intellectual
property
policy
had
a
number
of
facets
the
environmental
movement
had
invented
the
concept
of
the
environment
and
used
it
to
tie
together
a
set
of
phenomena
that
would
otherwise
seem
very
separate
in
doing
so
it
changed
perceptions
of
and
helped
to
form
coalitions
where
none
had
existed
before
just
as
earth
science
built
upon
research
into
the
fragile
interconnections
of
ecology
and
on
the
pigouvian
analysis
of
economic
externalities
i
argue
that
we
need
to
make
visible
the
invisible
contributions
of
the
public
domain
the
ecosystem
services
performed
by
the
underappreciated
but
nevertheless
vital
reservoir
of
freedom
in
culture
and
and
just
as
with
environmentalism
we
need
not
only
a
semantic
reorganization
or
a
set
of
conceptual
and
analytic
tools
but
a
movement
of
people
devoted
to
bringing
a
goal
to
the
attention
of
their
fellow
citizens
i
have
tried
hard
to
show
that
there
is
something
larger
going
on
under
the
realpolitik
of
land
grabs
by
disney
and
campaign
contributions
by
the
recording
industry
association
of
america
but
it
would
be
an
equal
and
opposite
mistake
to
think
that
this
is
just
about
a
dysfunctional
discourse
of
intellectual
property
in
this
part
of
the
analysis
too
the
environmental
movement
offers
some
useful
practical
reminders
the
ideas
of
ecology
and
environmental
welfare
economics
were
important
but
one
can
not
merely
write
a
sand
county
almanac
and
hope
the
world
will
change
environmentalists
piggybacked
on
existing
sources
of
conservationist
sentiment
love
of
nature
the
national
parks
movement
hikers
campers
birdwatchers
they
built
coalitions
between
those
who
might
be
affected
by
environmental
changes
they
even
stretched
their
political
base
by
discovering
albeit
too
slowly
the
realities
of
environmental
racism
on
the
one
hand
and
the
benefits
of
market
solutions
to
some
environmental
problems
on
the
other
some
of
these
aspects
at
least
could
be
replicated
in
the
politics
of
intellectual
property
ten
years
ago
when
i
first
offered
the
environmental
analogy
i
claimed
that
intellectual
property
policy
was
seen
as
a
contract
struck
between
industry
groups
something
technical
esoteric
and
largely
irrelevant
to
individual
citizens
except
in
that
they
were
purchasers
of
the
products
that
flowed
out
of
the
system
whether
or
not
that
view
has
ever
been
tenable
it
is
not
so
in
a
digital
age
instead
i
offered
the
basic
argument
laid
out
here
that
we
needed
a
politics
of
intellectual
property
modeled
on
the
environmental
movement
to
create
a
genuine
and
informed
political
debate
on
intellectual
property
so
far
i
have
concentrated
on
the
theoretical
and
academic
tools
such
a
debate
would
need
focusing
particularly
on
property
theory
and
on
economic
analysis
and
its
limits
but
if
there
is
to
be
a
genuinely
democratic
politics
of
intellectual
property
we
would
need
an
institutional
diversity
in
the
policymaking
debate
that
was
comparable
to
that
of
the
environmental
movement
environmentalism
presents
us
with
a
remarkable
diversity
of
organizational
forms
and
missions
we
have
greenpeace
the
environmental
legal
defense
fund
groups
of
concerned
scientists
and
the
audubon
society
each
with
its
own
methods
groups
of
supporters
and
sets
of
issues
yet
we
also
have
local
and
pragmatic
coalitions
to
save
a
particular
bit
of
green
space
using
the
private
tools
of
covenants
and
i
think
we
can
see
the
beginnings
of
the
replication
of
that
institutional
diversity
in
the
world
of
intangible
property
ten
years
ago
civil
society
had
little
to
offer
in
terms
of
groups
that
represented
anything
other
than
an
industry
position
on
intellectual
property
still
less
ones
that
took
seriously
the
preservation
of
the
public
domain
or
the
idea
that
intellectual
property
policy
was
a
matter
of
balance
rather
than
simple
maximization
of
rights
there
were
the
librarians
and
a
few
academics
that
was
about
it
this
position
has
changed
radically
there
are
academic
centers
that
concentrate
on
the
theoretical
issues
discussed
in
this
book
one
of
them
at
my
university
thanks
in
large
part
to
the
leadership
of
pamela
samuelson
there
are
law
student
clinics
that
do
impact
litigation
on
issues
such
as
fair
use
and
that
represent
underserved
clients
such
as
documentarians
but
beyond
academic
work
there
are
organizations
that
have
dedicated
themselves
to
advocacy
and
to
litigation
around
the
themes
of
preservation
of
the
public
domain
defense
of
limitations
and
exceptions
in
copyright
and
the
protection
of
free
speech
from
the
effects
of
intellectual
property
regulation
of
both
content
and
the
communications
infrastructure
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
did
exist
ten
years
ago
but
its
coverage
of
intellectual
property
issues
was
only
episodic
its
portfolio
of
litigation
and
public
education
on
the
subject
is
now
nothing
short
of
remarkable
public
knowledge
valuable
lobbying
and
education
is
another
obvious
example
international
organizations
with
similar
aims
include
the
open
rights
group
in
the
united
organizing
has
also
taken
place
around
particular
cases
such
as
eldred
ashcroft
the
challenge
to
the
sonny
bono
copyright
term
extension
activity
is
not
confined
to
the
world
of
copyright
the
public
patent
foundation
combats
patent
creep
by
exposing
and
challenging
bad
it
would
be
remiss
not
to
mention
the
international
access
to
knowledge
or
movement
inspired
by
the
work
of
jamie
while
its
focus
is
on
the
kinds
of
issues
represented
by
the
movement
it
has
made
the
idea
of
balance
in
intellectual
property
and
the
protection
of
the
public
domain
one
of
its
central
components
love
himself
is
also
the
central
figure
behind
the
idea
of
a
research
and
development
treaty
which
would
amend
international
trade
agreements
to
make
intellectual
property
merely
one
of
a
whole
range
of
economic
methods
for
stimulating
his
work
has
touched
almost
every
single
one
of
the
movements
discussed
here
the
access
to
knowledge
movement
has
many
institutional
variants
the
development
agenda
at
the
world
intellectual
property
organization
wipo
put
forward
by
india
and
brazil
includes
similar
themes
as
do
the
geneva
declaration
and
the
adelphi
charter
produced
by
the
united
kingdom
royal
society
for
the
encouragement
of
arts
manufactures
and
history
is
full
of
wordy
charters
and
declarations
of
course
by
themselves
they
mean
little
yet
the
level
of
public
and
media
attention
paid
to
them
indicates
that
intellectual
property
policy
is
now
of
interest
beyond
a
narrow
group
of
affected
industries
to
underscore
this
point
several
major
foundations
have
introduced
intellectual
property
initiatives
something
that
would
have
been
inconceivable
ten
years
finally
to
complete
the
analogy
to
the
land
trust
we
have
the
organizations
i
mentioned
earlier
such
as
creative
commons
and
the
free
software
the
latter
group
pioneered
within
software
the
attempt
to
create
a
licensed
commons
in
which
freedoms
are
guaranteed
the
licensed
commons
replaces
the
law
default
rules
with
choices
made
by
individuals
the
effects
of
which
are
magnified
by
collective
action
the
end
result
is
a
zone
of
public
freedom
enabled
by
private
choice
if
one
looks
at
these
institutions
and
actors
and
at
the
range
of
issues
on
which
they
focus
from
software
to
drug
patents
from
reverse
engineering
to
access
to
archival
records
the
obvious
question
is
how
did
they
overcome
the
collective
action
problem
what
ties
together
a
critique
of
digital
locks
and
the
movement
again
i
think
the
answer
points
to
the
usefulness
of
the
environmental
analogy
as
i
pointed
out
the
invention
of
the
environment
trope
tied
together
groups
whose
interests
considered
at
a
lower
level
of
abstraction
seemed
entirely
different
hunters
and
birdwatchers
antipollution
protesters
and
conservation
biologists
the
idea
of
the
environment
literally
created
the
or
set
of
preferences
that
ties
the
movement
together
the
same
is
true
here
apparently
disparate
interests
are
linked
by
ideas
of
the
protection
of
the
public
domain
and
of
the
importance
of
a
balance
between
protection
and
freedom
in
cultural
and
scientific
but
even
a
broad
range
of
initiatives
and
institutions
would
not
in
and
of
themselves
produce
results
one
must
convince
people
that
one
arguments
are
good
one
institutional
innovations
necessary
one
horror
stories
disturbing
environmentalism
has
managed
to
win
the
battle
for
clarity
to
make
its
points
clearly
enough
that
they
ceased
to
be
dismissed
as
arcane
or
technical
to
overcome
neglect
by
the
media
to
articulate
a
set
of
concerns
that
are
those
of
any
educated
citizen
the
other
striking
phenomenon
of
the
last
ten
years
is
the
migration
of
intellectual
property
issues
off
the
law
reviews
or
business
pages
and
onto
the
front
pages
and
the
editorial
pages
blogs
have
been
particularly
influential
widely
read
sites
such
as
slashdot
and
have
multiple
postings
on
intellectual
property
issues
each
day
some
are
rants
but
others
are
at
a
level
of
sophistication
that
once
would
have
been
confined
to
academic
scientists
passionately
debate
the
importance
of
open
access
to
scholarly
journals
geographers
and
climatologists
fume
over
access
to
geospatial
data
the
movement
has
been
pronounced
enough
to
generate
its
own
reaction
the
popular
comics
site
xkcd
has
strips
critical
of
the
digital
millennium
copyright
but
also
a
nerdily
idyllic
picture
of
a
stick
figure
reclining
under
a
tree
and
saying
sometimes
i
just
ca
get
outraged
over
copyright
law
that
cartoon
now
resides
on
my
computer
desktop
it
is
under
a
creative
commons
license
ironically
enough
who
can
blame
the
stick
figure
certainly
not
i
is
it
not
silly
to
equate
the
protection
of
the
environment
with
the
protection
of
the
public
domain
after
all
one
is
the
struggle
to
save
a
planetary
ecology
and
the
other
is
just
some
silly
argument
about
legal
rules
and
culture
and
science
i
would
be
the
first
to
yield
primacy
to
the
environmental
challenges
we
are
facing
mass
extinction
events
are
to
be
avoided
particularly
if
they
involve
you
personally
yet
my
willingness
to
minimize
the
importance
of
the
rules
that
determine
who
owns
science
and
culture
goes
only
so
far
a
better
intellectual
property
system
will
not
save
the
planet
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
most
promising
sets
of
tools
for
building
biofuels
comes
from
synthetic
biology
ask
some
of
the
leading
scientists
in
that
field
why
they
devoted
their
precious
time
to
trying
to
work
out
a
system
that
would
offer
the
valuable
incentives
that
patents
provide
while
leaving
a
commons
of
biobricks
open
to
all
for
future
development
i
worry
about
these
rules
naturally
they
were
forced
to
do
so
a
better
intellectual
property
system
certainly
will
not
end
world
hunger
still
it
is
interesting
to
read
about
the
lengthy
struggles
to
clear
the
multiple
overlapping
patents
on
goldenricetm
a
rice
grain
genetically
engineered
to
cure
vitamin
deficiencies
that
nearly
perished
in
a
thicket
of
blurrily
overlapping
a
better
intellectual
property
system
will
not
cure
aids
or
rheumatoid
arthritis
or
huntington
disease
or
malaria
certainly
not
by
itself
patents
have
already
played
a
positive
role
in
contributing
to
treatments
for
the
first
two
though
they
are
unlikely
to
help
much
on
the
latter
two
the
affected
populations
are
too
few
or
too
poor
but
overly
broad
or
vague
or
confusing
patents
could
and
i
believe
have
hurt
all
of
those
efforts
even
those
being
pursued
out
of
altruism
those
problems
could
be
mitigated
reforms
that
made
possible
legal
and
facilitated
distribution
of
patented
medicines
in
africa
might
save
millions
of
lives
they
would
cost
drug
companies
little
africa
makes
up
percent
of
their
global
market
interesting
alternative
methods
have
even
been
suggested
for
encouraging
investment
in
treatments
for
neglected
diseases
and
diseases
of
the
world
poor
at
the
moment
we
spend
percent
of
our
research
dollars
on
diseases
that
affect
percent
of
the
global
population
perhaps
this
is
the
best
we
can
do
but
would
it
not
be
nice
to
have
a
vigorous
public
debate
on
the
subject
some
possible
innovations
are
much
easier
a
simple
rule
that
required
the
eventual
free
publication
online
of
all
health
research
under
open
licenses
rather
than
its
sequestration
behind
the
paywalls
of
commercial
journals
could
help
fuel
remarkable
innovations
in
scientific
synthesis
and
research
while
giving
citizens
access
to
the
research
for
which
they
have
already
paid
good
intellectual
property
policy
will
not
save
our
culture
but
bad
policy
may
lock
up
our
cultural
heritage
unnecessarily
leave
it
to
molder
in
libraries
forbid
citizens
to
digitize
it
even
though
the
vast
majority
of
it
will
never
be
available
publicly
and
no
copyright
owner
can
be
found
would
you
not
prefer
the
world
in
which
your
children
could
look
at
the
library
of
congress
online
catalogue
and
click
to
get
the
book
or
film
or
song
that
otherwise
languished
as
an
orphan
work
good
intellectual
policy
will
not
necessarily
give
us
great
new
music
but
the
policy
we
have
today
would
make
some
of
the
music
we
most
cherish
illegal
or
at
least
legally
questionable
does
that
inspire
confidence
for
the
future
as
for
the
world
wide
web
i
offer
again
my
thought
experiment
from
the
first
part
of
this
chapter
would
we
be
more
likely
to
invent
it
or
forbid
it
today
we
are
certainly
working
busily
to
change
the
openness
of
the
computer
the
neutrality
of
the
network
and
the
degree
of
control
that
content
companies
can
exert
over
hardware
i
do
not
claim
that
the
issues
i
have
written
about
here
are
the
most
important
problem
the
world
faces
that
would
be
ridiculous
but
i
do
claim
that
they
are
facets
of
a
very
important
problem
and
one
to
which
we
are
paying
far
too
little
attention
i
would
also
be
the
first
to
admit
that
these
issues
are
complicated
even
if
we
heeded
the
precepts
i
have
outlined
in
this
book
even
if
we
actually
started
to
look
at
intellectual
property
as
an
empirical
question
even
if
we
turned
to
data
rather
than
faith
for
our
assessments
reasonable
people
would
disagree
about
much
some
of
the
most
ludicrous
recent
excesses
huge
retrospective
copyright
term
extensions
database
rights
proposed
webcasting
treaties
business
method
patents
do
not
pass
the
laugh
test
in
my
view
and
that
of
most
scholars
stopping
and
then
reversing
that
tide
would
be
valuable
even
transformative
but
other
issues
are
a
closer
call
it
is
also
true
that
we
do
not
have
all
the
tools
we
need
a
lot
remains
to
be
done
both
academically
and
practically
we
need
better
evidence
we
need
property
theories
that
give
us
as
rich
a
conception
of
property
outside
of
the
public
domain
and
the
commons
as
we
have
of
property
itself
we
need
to
rethink
some
of
our
policies
of
international
harmonization
and
reconsider
what
types
of
policy
actually
benefit
the
developing
world
we
should
explore
ways
of
compensating
artists
that
are
very
different
from
the
ones
we
use
now
and
study
the
use
of
distributed
creativity
and
open
source
in
new
areas
of
science
and
culture
difficulties
aside
i
have
tried
here
to
show
that
we
need
a
cultural
environmental
movement
a
politics
that
enables
us
first
to
see
and
then
to
preserve
the
public
domain
to
understand
its
contributions
to
our
art
our
technology
and
our
culture
where
is
that
movement
now
there
is
cause
for
both
concern
and
optimism
concern
because
it
is
still
hard
for
courts
legislators
policy
makers
and
citizens
to
see
beyond
the
word
property
to
the
reality
underneath
i
started
this
book
with
the
question
from
my
son
about
the
online
catalogue
of
the
library
of
congress
where
do
you
click
to
get
the
book
in
the
supreme
court
heard
eldred
ashcroft
the
challenge
to
retrospective
copyright
term
extension
over
two
strong
dissents
the
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
against
both
first
amendment
and
copyright
clause
challenges
the
dead
had
their
copyrights
extended
yet
again
the
widest
legal
restriction
of
speech
in
the
history
of
the
republic
putting
most
century
books
poems
films
and
songs
for
another
twenty
years
without
a
corresponding
speech
benefit
or
incentive
can
proceed
without
significant
first
amendment
review
does
such
a
decision
mean
the
task
this
book
undertakes
to
take
seriously
the
contributions
of
the
public
domain
to
innovation
culture
and
speech
is
ultimately
doomed
whatever
its
intellectual
merits
to
face
a
hostile
or
uncomprehending
audience
admittedly
eldred
focused
specifically
on
two
particular
constitutional
claims
still
the
attitude
of
the
majority
toward
the
importance
of
the
public
domain
whether
in
the
textual
limitations
on
congress
power
or
the
application
of
the
first
amendment
can
hardly
be
cause
for
optimism
and
yet
the
media
reaction
was
remarkable
the
new
york
times
was
sufficiently
unfamiliar
with
the
term
public
domain
that
it
was
not
entirely
sure
whether
or
not
to
use
the
definite
article
in
front
of
it
but
unfamiliarity
did
not
imply
complacency
an
editorial
declared
that
this
decision
makes
it
likely
that
we
are
seeing
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
public
domain
and
the
birth
of
copyright
perpetuity
public
domain
has
been
a
grand
experiment
one
that
should
not
be
allowed
to
die
the
ability
to
draw
freely
on
the
entire
creative
output
of
humanity
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
live
in
a
time
of
such
fruitful
creative
ferment
the
washington
post
though
more
inclined
to
agree
that
retrospective
extension
might
be
constitutional
declared
the
copyright
system
to
be
broken
in
that
it
effectively
and
perpetually
protects
nearly
all
material
that
anyone
would
want
to
cite
or
use
that
not
what
the
framers
envisioned
and
it
not
in
the
public
interest
i
could
not
agree
more
but
as
i
have
tried
to
show
here
the
process
is
not
limited
to
copyright
or
culture
or
texts
or
the
united
states
think
of
the
stories
about
business
method
patents
or
synthetic
biology
or
the
regulation
of
musical
borrowing
on
the
atomic
level
think
of
the
discussion
of
the
openness
aversion
that
began
this
chapter
in
the
middle
of
the
most
successful
and
exciting
experiment
in
nonproprietary
distributed
creativity
in
the
history
of
the
species
our
policy
makers
can
see
only
the
threat
from
piracy
they
act
accordingly
our
second
enclosure
movement
is
well
under
way
the
poem
with
which
i
began
chapter
told
us
and
geese
will
still
a
common
lack
till
they
go
and
steal
it
back
i
can
not
match
the
terseness
or
the
rhyme
but
if
we
assume
that
the
enclosure
of
the
commons
of
the
mind
will
bring
us
prosperity
great
science
and
vibrant
culture
well
we
will
look
like
very
silly
geese

suggests
that

moreover
those

do
read
patents
do
not
use
them
primarily
as
a
source
of
information
on
technology
instead
they
use
them
for
other
purposes
such
as
keeping
track
of
competitors
or
checking
for

there
are
in
fact
sound
theoretical
reasons
why
the
disclosed
information
may
not
be
very
valuable
fritz
machlup
and
edith
penrose
report
that
the
argument
about
diffusion
is
an
old
one
popular
since
the
century
they
also
point
out
that
at
least
through
the
economists
have
been
skeptical
about
this
argument
the
problem
also
recognized
in
the
century
is
that
unconcealable
inventions
are
patented
so
patents
reveal
little
that
could
not
be
otherwise

it
is
easy
in

reading
this
prodigious
outpouring
of
knowledge
and
enthusiasm
to
forget
the
other
side
of
jefferson
and
the
social
system
that
gave
him
the
leisure
to
write
these
letters
just
a
few
weeks
before

he
wrote
a

to
jeremiah
goodman
about
a

called
hercules
who
had

the

enunciated
in
the

at

how
could
a
man
who

that

legal
historians
and
that
if
we
understand
the
use
of
the
word
privilege
in
historical
context
we
see
that
the
patent
privilege
was
influenced
by
a
philosophy
of
natural
rights
as
well
as
the
antimonopolist
utilitarianism
described
here
i
both
agree
and
disagree
professor
mossoff
central
point
that
the
word
privilege
was
not
understood
by
audiences
as
the
antonym
of
right
is
surely
correct
to
lay
great
stress
on
the
linguistic
point
that
the
patent
right
is
merely
a
privilege
is
to
rest
one
argument
on
a
weak
reed
but
this
is
not
the
only
argument
one
could
also
believe
that
intellectual
property
rights
have
vital
conceptual
and
practical
differences
with
property
rights
over
tangible
objects
or
land
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
who
were
most
involved
in
the
intellectual
property
clause
were
deeply
opposed
to
the
confusion
involved
in
conflating
the
two
and
that
they
looked
upon
this
confusion
particularly
harshly
because
of
an
intense
concern
about
state
monopolies
one
can
still
disagree
with
this
assessment
of
course
one
can
interpret
madison
words
this
way
or
that
or
interpret
subsequent
patent
decisions
as
deep
statements
of
principle
or
commonplace
rhetorical
flourishes
still
it
seems
to
me
a
much
stronger
argument
than
the
one
based
on
the
distinction
i
am
not
sure
professor
mossoff
would
disagree
professor
mossoff
is
also
correct
to
point
out
that
a
legal
privilege
did
sometimes
mean
to
an
reader
something
that
the
state
was
to
grant
there
was
in
fact
a
wide
range
of
sources
from
which
an
lawyer
could
derive
a
state
obligation
to
grant
a
privilege
legal
talk
was
a
normative
bouillabaisse
a
rich
stew
of
natural
right
common
law
utility
and
progress
often
thrown
together
without
regard
to
their
differences
some
lawyers
and
judges
thought
the
common
law
embodied
natural
rights
others
that
it
represented
the
dictates
of
progress
and
utility
and
others
more
confusingly
still
seemed
to
adopt
all
of
those
views
at
once
nevertheless
i
would
agree
that
some
writers
saw
claims
of
right
beneath
the
assertion
of
some
privileges
and
that
a
smaller
number
of
those
assumed
law
right
and
natural
right
to
be
equivalent
and
thus
saw
a
strong
state
obligation
to
grant
a
particular
privilege
based
on
natural
right
wherever
that
privilege
had
been
recognized
by
english
or
common
law
but
here
is
where
i
part
company
with
professor
mossoff
first
i
do
not
believe
that
the
most
important
architects
of
the
intellectual
property
clause
shared
that
view
when
it
came
to
patents
and
copyrights
jefferson
of
course
was
not
one
of
those
who
believed
the
state
was
so
bound
society
may
give
an
exclusive
right
to
the
profits
arising
from
inventions
as
an
encouragement
to
men
to
pursue
ideas
which
may
produce
utility
but
this
may
or
may
not
be
done
according
to
the
will
and
convenience
of
the
society
without
claim
or
complaint
from
any
body
letter
to
mcpherson
emphasis
added
more
importantly
jefferson
thinking
about
patents
was
infused
by
a
deeply
utilitarian
antimonopolist
tinge
so
i
would
argue
was
madison
the
quotations
from
madison
which
i
give
later
show
clearly
to
me
at
least
that
madison
shared
jefferson
deeply
utilitarian
attitude
toward
patent
and
copyright
law
i
think
there
is
very
good
reason
to
believe
that
this
attitude
was
dominant
among
the
scottish
enlightenment
thinkers
whose
writings
were
so
influential
to
the
framers
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
american
revolution
was
violently
against
the
world
of
monopoly
and
corruption
that
was
the
supposed
target
of
the
english
statute
of
monopolies
itself
hardly
a
natural
rights
document
yes
those
thinkers
might
fall
back
into
talking
about
how
hard
an
inventor
had
worked
or
construing
a
patent
expansively
yes
they
might
think
that
within
the
boundaries
of
settled
law
it
would
be
unjust
to
deny
one
inventor
a
patent
when
the
general
scheme
of
patent
law
had
already
been
laid
down
but
that
did
not
and
does
not
negate
the
antimonopolist
and
for
that
matter
utilitarian
roots
of
the
constitution
intellectual
property
clause
second
while
i
agree
that
there
were
strands
of
natural
right
thinking
and
a
labor
theory
of
value
in
the
intellectual
property
system
and
that
they
continue
to
this
day
indeed
these
were
the
very
views
that
the
feist
decision
discussed
in
chapter
repudiated
as
late
as
i
think
it
is
easy
to
make
too
much
of
that
fact
is
this
signal
or
noise
there
are
conceptual
reasons
to
think
it
is
the
latter
later
in
this
chapter
i
discuss
the
evolution
of
the
droits
tradition
in
france
here
at
the
supposed
heart
of
the
natural
rights
tradition
we
find
thinkers
driven
inexorably
to
consider
the
question
of
limits
how
far
does
the
supposed
natural
right
extend
in
time
in
space
in
subject
matter
it
is
at
that
moment
that
the
utilitarian
focus
and
the
fear
of
monopoly
represented
by
jefferson
and
madison
and
for
that
matter
locke
and
condorcet
become
so
important
professor
mossoff
is
correct
to
criticize
the
focus
on
the
word
privilege
and
also
correct
that
the
ideas
of
natural
right
and
the
labor
theory
of
value
always
color
attitudes
toward
intellectual
property
claims
but
it
would
be
an
equal
and
opposite
mistake
to
ignore
two
points
first
intellectual
property
rights
are
profoundly
different
from
physical
property
rights
over
land
in
ways
that
should
definitively
shape
policy
choices
second
partly
because
of
those
differences
and
because
of
the
influence
of
scottish
enlightenment
thought
on
the
american
revolution
in
particular
there
was
a
powerful
antimonopolist
and
sentiment
behind
the
copyright
and
patent
clause
simply
read
the
clause
congress
is
given
the
power
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
by
securing
for
limited
times
to
authors
and
inventors
the
exclusive
right
to
their
respective
writings
and
discoveries
does
this
really
read
like
the
work
of
a
group
of
believers
in
natural
right
on
the
contrary
it
reads
like
a
limited
grant
of
power
to
achieve
a
particular
utilitarian
goal
that
sentiment
nicely
encapsulated
in
but
by
no
means
limited
to
the
words
of
jefferson
is
still
a
good
starting
place
for
an
understanding
of
intellectual
property
see
ochoa
and
rose
origins
and
edward
walterscheid
the
nature
of
the
intellectual
property
clause
a
study
in
historical
perspective
buffalo
hein
ochoa
rose
and
walterscheid
stress
the
antimonopolist
concerns
that
animated
some
of
those
who
were
most
active
in
the
debates
about
intellectual
property
they
also
point
out
the
influence
of
the
english
statute
of
monopolies
of
which
attacked
monopolies
in
general
while
making
an
exception
for
periods
of
legal
exclusivity
for
a
limited
time
granted
over
sole
working
or
making
of
any
manner
of
new
manufacture
within
this
realm
to
the
first
true
inventor
or
inventors
of
such
manufactures
which
others
at
the
time
of
the
making
of
such
letters
patents
grants
did
not
use
so
they
be
not
contrary
to
the
law
nor
mischievous
to
the
state
by
raising
of
the
prices
of
commodities
at
home
or
hurt

or
generally
inconvenient

monopolies
tho
in
certain
cases
useful
ought
to
be
granted
with
caution
and
guarded
with
strictness
against
abuse
the
constitution
of
the
has
limited
them
to
two
cases
the
authors
of
books
and
of
useful
inventions
in
both
which
they
are
considered
as
a
compensation
for
a
benefit
actually
gained
to
the
community
as
a
purchase
of
property
which
the
owner
might
otherwise
withhold
from
public
use
there
can
be
no
just
objection
to
a
temporary
monopoly
in
these
cases
but
it
ought
to
be
temporary
because
under
that
limitation
a
sufficient
recompence
and
encouragement
may
be
given
the
limitation
is
particularly
proper
in
the
case
of
inventions
because
they
grow
so
much
out
of
preceding
ones
that
there
is
the
less
merit
in
the
authors
and
because
for
the
same
reason
the
discovery
might
be
expected
in
a
short
time
from
other
hands
monopolies
have
been
granted
in
other
countries
and
by
some
of
the
states
in
this
on
another
principle
that
of
supporting
some
useful
undertaking
until
experience
and
success
should
render
the
monopoly
unnecessary
and
lead
to
a
salutary
competition
but
grants
of
this
sort
can
be
justified
in
very
peculiar
cases
only
if
at
all
the
danger
being
very
great
that
the
good
resulting
from
the
operation
of
the
monopoly
will
be
overbalanced
by
the
evil
effect
of
the
precedent
and
it
being
not
impossible
that
the
monopoly
itself
in
its
original
operation
may
produce
more
evil
than
good
in
all
cases
of
monopoly
not
excepting
those
in
favor
of
authors
and
inventors
it
would
be
well
to
reserve
to
the
state
a
right
to
extinguish
the
monopoly
by
paying
a
specified
and
reasonable
sum
perpetual
monopolies
of
every
sort
are
forbidden

both
of
these
articles
attempt
not
to
use
locke
as
the
basis
for
a
world
of
absolute
right
but
instead
to
focus
on
the
locke
whose
world
of
private
property
coexisted
with
a
commons
albeit
one
much
diminished
after
the
invention
of
money
if
one
goes
far
enough
into
the
lockean
conception
tuning
enough
and
as
good
so
as
to
allow
for
a
vigorous
commons
and
the
claims
of
labor
so
as
to
take
account
of
the
importance
of
the
embedded
contributions
of
culture
and
science
then
the
differences
between
the
jeffersonian
view
and
the
lockean
view
start
to
recede
in
significance
academics
have
found
the
lockean
view
attractive
noting
correctly
that
locke
is
commonly
brandished
as
a
rhetorical
emblem
for
property
schemes
that
he
himself
would
have
scorned
yet
when
one
looks
at
the
actual
world
of
intellectual
property
policy
discourse
and
the
difficulty
of
enunciating
even
the
simple
jeffersonian
antimonopolist
ideas
i
lay
out
here
it
is
hard
to
imagine
the
nuanced
lockean
view
flourishing
consider
this
comment
of
jeremy
waldron
and
ask
yourself
is
this
result
more
likely
from
within
the
jeffersonian
or
the
lockean
view
our
tendency
of
course
is
to
focus
on
authors
when
we
think
about
intellectual
property
many
of
us
are
authors
ourselves
reading
a
case
about
copyright
we
can
empathize
readily
with
a
plaintiff
feeling
for
the
effort
he
has
put
in
his
need
to
control
his
work
and
his
natural
desire
to
reap
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
in
this
essay
however
i
shall
look
at
the
way
we
think
about
actual
potential
and
putative
infringers
of
copyright
those
whose
freedom
is
or
might
be
constrained
by
others
ownership
of
songs
plays
words
images
and
stories
clearly
our
concept
of
the
author
and
this
concept
of
the
copier
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
if
we
think
of
an
author
as
having
a
natural
right
to
profit
from
his
work
then
we
will
think
of
the
copier
as
some
sort
of
thief
whereas
if
we
think
of
the
author
as
beneficiary
of
a
statutory
monopoly
it
may
be
easier
to
see
the
copier
as
an
embodiment
of
free
enterprise
values
these
are
the
connections
i
want
to
discuss
and
my
argument
will
be
that
we
can
not
begin
to
unravel
the
conundrums
of
moral
justification
in
this
area
unless
we
are
willing
to
approach
the
matter
from
both
sides
of
the
question
after
a
magisterial
study
of
justifications
for
the
existing
world
of
intellectual
property
waldron
concludes
t
he
fact
is
however
that
whether
or
not
we
speak
of
a
burden
of
proof
an
institution
like
intellectual
property
is
not
justifying
we
owe
a
justification
to
anyone
who
finds
that
he
can
move
less
freely
than
he
would
in
the
absence
of
the
institution
so
although
the
people
whose
perspective
i
have
taken
the
copiers
may
be
denigrated
as
unoriginal
plagiarists
or
thieves
of
others
work
still
they
are
the
ones
who
feel
the
immediate
impact
of
our
intellectual
property
laws
it
affects
what
they
may
do
how
they
may
speak
and
how
they
may
earn
a
living
of
course
nothing
is
settled
by
saying
that
it
is
their
interests
that
are
particularly
at
stake
if
the
tables
were
turned
we
should
want
to
highlight
the
perspective
of
the
authors
but
as
things
stand
the
copiers
are
the
ones
to
whom
a
justification
of
intellectual
property
is
owed
see
jeremy
waldron

authors
to
copiers

rights
and

values

justification
seems
more

underlying

the

was
uncertain
about
this
point
preliminarily
we
note
that
the
supreme
court
has
never
held
that
fair

is
constitutionally
required
although
some
isolated
statements
in
its
opinions
might
arguably
be
enlisted
for
such
a
universal
city
studios
corley
cir
in
my
view
both
logic
and
those
isolated
statements
suggest
that
fair
use
is
required
as
i
point
out
later
when
the
supreme
court
revisited
the
matter
in
the
case
of
eldred
ashcroft
it
stressed
that
it
was
precisely
the
internal
limitations
such
as
fair
use
that
made
copyright
law
normally
immune
to
first
amendment
scrutiny
the
court
added
when
congress
has
not
altered
the
traditional
contours
of
copyright
protection
further
first
amendment
scrutiny
is
unnecessary
ibid
at
citing
harper
row
at
yet
that
is
exactly
what
the
dmca
does
alters
the
traditional
contours
of
copyright
protection
by
handing
out
the
exclusive
right
at
the
same
time
as
it
confers
a
legal

to
remove

rafael

piracy
on
the
silver
screen
journal
of
industrial
economics
rob
and
waldfogel
surveyed
college
students
traditionally
a
population
that
engages
in
high
levels
of
downloading
since
they
have
free
and
extremely
high
speed
internet
connections
lots
of
leisure
time
and
low
disposable
income
even
among
this
group
the
authors
found
that
total
levels
of
downloading
were
low
percent
of
paid
consumption
the
authors
also
assumed
that
all
unpaid
downloading
or
dvd
burning
was
equal
to
piracy
an
assumption
that
is
clearly
false
the
sony
case
makes
that
clear
in
fact
rob
and
waldfogel
found
a
positive
relationship
between
second
time
unpaid
viewings
and
future
paid
viewings
watching
the
movie
a
second
time
on
a
downloaded
or
privately
made
copy
burned
from
the
airwaves
actually
was
associated
with
more
paid
purchases
the
authors
were
skeptical
of
any
causal
link
however
admittedly
section
only
affects
works
protected
under
the
copyright
act
so
arguably
the
legal
protection
of
the
digital
fence
would
expire
with
the
copyright
term
but
even
if
the
courts
interpreted
the
statute
this
way
two
problems
would
remain
first
since
the
dmca
prohibited
the
trafficking
in
tools
which
allowed
the
breaking
of
the
encryption
the
law
would
have
effectively
forbidden
the
production
of
wire
cutters
for
gaining
access
to
identically
encrypted
public
domain
works
remember
judge
kaplan
discussion
of
the
irrelevance
of
johansen
motives
second
it
would
be
trivially
easy
to
add
a
trivial
amount
of
new
copyrighted
material
to
the
work
that
had
fallen
into
the
public
domain
access
to
the
public
domain
work
would
then
be
prohibited
for
another
period
of
life
plus
seventy
years
and
so
on
the
copyright
office
holds
hearings
on
the
question
of
whether
there
are
any
classes
of
work
that
need
exemption
from
the
dmca
provisions
so
far
those
exemptions
have
been

anarchism
triumphant
i
ncentives
is
merely
a
metaphor
and
as
a
metaphor
to
describe
human
creative
activity
it
pretty
crummy
i
have
said
this
before
but
the
better
metaphor
arose
on
the
day
michael
faraday
first
noticed
what
happened
when
he
wrapped
a
coil
of
wire
around
a
magnet
and
spun
the
magnet
current
flows
in
such
a
wire
but
we
do
ask
what
the
incentive
is
for
the
electrons
to
leave
home
we
say
that
the
current
results
from
an
emergent
property
of
the
system
which
we
call
induction
the
question
we
ask
is
the
resistance
of
the
wire
so
metaphorical
corollary
to
faraday
law
says
that
if
you
wrap
the
internet
around
every
person
on
the
planet
and
spin
the
planet
software
flows
in
the
network
it
an
emergent
property
of
connected
human
minds
that
they
create
things
for
one
another
pleasure
and
to
conquer
their
uneasy
sense
of
being
too
alone
the
only
question
to
ask
is
what
the
resistance
of
the
network
moglen
metaphorical
corollary
to
ohm
law
states
that
the
resistance
of
the
network
is
directly
proportional
to
the
field
strength
of
the
property
system
so
the
right
answer
to
the
econodwarf
is
resist
the
resistance
benkler
reasoning
is
characteristically
elegant
even
formal
in
its
precision
while
mine
is
clunkier

economists
generally
assume
preferences
are
simply
given
individuals
just
have
them
and
they
are
exogenous
to
the
legal
system
in
the
sense
that
they
are
unaffected
by
the
allocation
of
legal
rights
the
emergence
of
the
movements
and
institutions
i
am
describing
here
paints
a
different
picture
the
preferences
are
socially
constructed
created
through
a
collective
process
of
debate
and
decision
which
shifts
the
level
of
abstraction
upwards
and
as
kapczynski
perceptively
notes
they
are
highly
influenced
by
the
legal
categories
and
rights
against
which
the
groups
involved
initially
defined
themselves
