travels
through
france
and
italy
by
tobias
smollett
introduction
by
thomas
seccombe
i
many
pens
have
been
burnished
this
year
of
grace
for
the
purpose
of
celebrating
with
befitting
honour
the
second
centenary
of
the
birth
of
henry
fielding
but
it
is
more
than
doubtful
if
when
the
right
date
occurs
in
march
anything
like
the
same
alacrity
will
be
shown
to
commemorate
one
who
was
for
many
years
and
by
such
judges
as
scott
hazlitt
and
charles
dickens
considered
fielding
complement
and
absolute
to
say
the
least
in
literary
achievement
smollett
fame
indeed
seems
to
have
fallen
upon
an
unprosperous
curve
the
coarseness
of
his
fortunate
rival
is
condoned
while
his
is
condemned
without
appeal
smollett
value
is
assessed
without
discrimination
at
that
of
his
least
worthy
productions
and
the
historical
value
of
his
work
as
a
prime
modeller
of
all
kinds
of
new
literary
material
is
overlooked
consider
for
a
moment
as
not
wholly
unworthy
of
attention
his
mere
versatility
as
a
man
of
letters
apart
from
roderick
random
and
its
successors
which
gave
him
a
european
fame
he
wrote
a
standard
history
and
a
standard
version
of
don
quixote
both
of
which
held
their
ground
against
all
comers
for
over
a
century
he
created
both
satirical
and
romantic
types
he
wrote
two
lyrics
and
launched
the
best
review
and
most
popular
magazine
of
his
day
he
was
the
centre
of
a
literary
group
the
founder
to
some
extent
of
a
school
of
professional
writers
of
which
strange
and
novel
class
after
the
great
cham
of
literature
as
he
called
johnson
he
affords
one
of
the
first
satisfactory
specimens
upon
a
fairly
large
scale
he
is
indeed
a
more
satisfactory
because
a
more
independent
example
of
the
new
species
than
the
great
cham
himself
the
late
professor
beljame
has
shown
us
how
the
milieu
was
created
in
which
with
no
subvention
whether
from
a
patron
a
theatre
a
political
paymaster
a
prosperous
newspaper
or
a
fashionable
an
independent
writer
of
the
century
provided
that
he
was
competent
could
begin
to
extort
something
more
than
a
bare
subsistence
from
the
reluctant
coffers
of
the
london
booksellers
for
the
purpose
of
such
a
demonstration
no
better
illustration
could
possibly
be
found
i
think
than
the
career
of
tobias
smollett
and
yet
curiously
enough
in
the
collection
of
critical
monographs
so
well
known
under
the
generic
title
of
english
men
of
letters
a
series
by
the
way
which
includes
nathaniel
hawthorne
and
maria
edgeworth
no
room
or
place
has
hitherto
been
found
for
smollett
any
more
than
for
ben
jonson
both
of
them
surely
considerable
men
of
letters
in
the
very
strictest
and
most
representative
sense
of
the
term
both
jonson
and
smollett
were
to
an
unusual
extent
centres
of
the
literary
life
of
their
time
and
if
the
great
ben
had
his
tribe
of
imitators
and
adulators
toby
also
had
his
clan
of
delineated
for
us
by
a
master
hand
in
the
pages
of
humphry
clinker
to
make
fielding
the
of
a
group
reflecting
the
literature
of
his
day
would
be
an
artistic
impossibility
it
would
be
perfectly
easy
in
the
case
of
smollett
who
was
descried
by
critics
from
afar
as
a
colossus
bestriding
the
summit
of
the
contemporary
parnassus
whatever
there
may
be
of
truth
in
these
observations
upon
the
eclipse
of
a
once
magical
name
applies
with
double
force
to
that
one
of
all
smollett
books
which
has
sunk
farthest
in
popular
disesteem
modern
editors
have
gone
to
the
length
of
excommunicating
smollett
travels
altogether
from
the
fellowship
of
his
collective
works
critic
has
followed
critic
in
denouncing
the
book
as
that
of
a
splenetic
invalid
and
yet
it
is
a
book
for
which
all
english
readers
have
cause
to
be
grateful
not
only
as
a
document
on
smollett
and
his
times
not
only
as
being
in
a
sense
the
raison
of
the
sentimental
journey
and
the
precursor
in
a
very
special
sense
of
humphry
clinker
but
also
as
being
intrinsically
an
uncommonly
readable
book
and
even
i
venture
to
assert
in
many
respects
one
of
smollett
best
portions
of
the
work
exhibit
literary
quality
of
a
high
order
as
a
whole
it
represents
a
valuable
because
a
rather
uncommon
view
and
as
a
literary
record
of
travel
it
is
distinguished
by
a
very
exceptional
veracity
i
am
not
prepared
to
define
the
differentia
of
a
really
book
of
travel
sympathy
is
important
but
not
indispensable
or
smollett
would
be
ruled
out
of
court
at
once
scientific
knowledge
keen
observation
or
intuitive
power
of
discrimination
go
far
to
enlist
our
curiosity
or
enthusiasm
or
to
excite
our
wonder
are
even
stronger
recommendations
charm
of
personal
manner
power
of
will
anthropological
interest
in
view
of
some
great
objects
all
these
qualities
have
made
live
one
knows
pretty
nearly
the
books
that
one
is
prepared
to
in
this
department
of
literature

and
all
or
almost
all
of
knight
i
have
run
through
most
of
them
at
one
breath
and
the
sum
total
would
not
bend
a
moderately
stout
bookshelf
how
many
works
on
the
other
hand
are
already
worse
than
dead
or
should
we
say
better
dead
the
case
of
smollett
travels
there
is
good
reason
to
hope
is
only
one
of
suspended
animation
to
come
to
surer
ground
it
is
a
fact
worth
noting
that
each
of
the
four
great
prose
masters
of
the
third
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
tried
his
hand
at
a
personal
record
of
travel
fielding
came
first
in
with
his
journal
of
a
voyage
to
lisbon
twelve
years
later
was
published
smollett
travels
through
france
and
italy
then
in
sterne
sentimental
journey
followed
in
by
johnson
journey
to
the
hebrides
each
of
the
four
in
which
beneath
the
apparel
of
the
man
of
letters
we
can
discern
respectively
the
characteristics
of
police
magistrate
surgeon
confessor
and
moralist
enjoyed
a
fair
amount
of
popularity
in
its
day
fielding
journal
had
perhaps
the
least
immediate
success
of
the
four
sterne
journey
unquestionably
had
the
most
the
tenant
of
shandy
hall
as
was
customary
in
the
first
heyday
of
anglomania
went
to
paris
to
ratify
his
successes
and
the
resounding
triumph
of
his
naughtiness
there
by
a
reflex
action
secured
the
vote
of
london
posterity
has
fully
sanctioned
this
particular
judicium
paridis
the
sentimental
journey
is
a
book
sui
generis
and
in
the
reliable
kind
of
popularity
which
takes
concrete
form
in
successive
reprints
it
has
far
eclipsed
its
rivals
the
fine
literary
aroma
which
pervades
every
line
of
this
small
masterpiece
is
not
the
predominant
characteristic
of
the
great
journey
nevertheless
and
in
spite
of
the
malignity
of
the
ossianite
press
it
fully
justified
the
assumption
of
the
booksellers
that
it
would
prove
a
sound
book
it
is
full
of
sensible
observations
and
is
written
in
johnson
most
scholarly
balanced
and
dignified
style
few
can
read
it
without
a
sense
of
being
repaid
if
only
by
the
portentous
sentence
in
which
the
author
celebrates
his
arrival
at
the
shores
of
loch
ness
where
he
reposes
upon
a
bank
such
as
a
writer
of
romance
might
have
delighted
to
feign
and
reflects
that
a
uniformity
of
barrenness
can
afford
very
little
amusement
to
the
traveller
that
it
is
easy
to
sit
at
home
and
conceive
rocks
and
heath
and
waterfalls
and
that
these
journeys
are
useless
labours
which
neither
impregnate
the
imagination
nor
enlarge
the
understanding
fielding
contribution
to
geography
has
far
less
solidity
and
importance
but
it
discovers
to
not
a
few
readers
an
unfeigned
charm
that
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
pages
of
either
sterne
or
johnson
a
thoughtless
fragment
suffices
to
show
the
writer
in
his
true
colours
as
one
of
the
most
delightful
fellows
in
our
literature
and
to
convey
just
unmistakably
to
all
good
men
and
true
the
rare
and
priceless
sense
of
human
fellowship
there
remain
the
travels
through
france
and
italy
by
smollett
and
though
these
may
not
exhibit
the
marmoreal
glamour
of
johnson
or
the
intimate
fascination
of
fielding
or
the
essential
literary
quality
which
permeates
the
subtle
dialogue
and
artful
vignette
of
sterne
yet
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
not
without
some
hope
of
success
among
the
that
the
travels
before
us
are
fully
deserving
of
a
place
and
that
not
the
least
significant
in
the
quartette
the
temporary
eclipse
of
their
fame
i
attribute
first
to
the
studious
depreciation
of
sterne
and
walpole
and
secondly
to
a
refinement
of
snobbishness
on
the
part
of
the
travelling
crowd
who
have
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
to
listen
to
common
sense
such
as
smollett
in
matters
of
connoisseurship
is
tantamount
to
confessing
oneself
a
galilean
of
the
outermost
court
in
this
connection
too
the
itinerant
divine
gave
the
travelling
doctor
a
very
nasty
fall
meeting
the
latter
at
turin
just
as
smollett
was
about
to
turn
his
face
homewards
in
march
sterne
wrote
of
him
in
the
famous
journey
of
thus
the
learned
smelfungus
travelled
from
boulogne
to
paris
from
paris
to
rome
and
so
on
but
he
set
out
with
the
spleen
and
jaundice
and
every
object
he
passed
by
was
discoloured
or
distorted
he
wrote
an
account
of
them
but
was
nothing
but
the
account
of
his
miserable
feelings
i
met
smelfungus
he
wrote
later
on
in
the
grand
portico
of
the
pantheon
he
was
just
coming
out
of
it
nothing
but
a
huge
cockpit
said
he
wish
you
had
said
nothing
worse
of
the
venus
de
medici
replied
i
for
in
passing
through
florence
i
had
heard
he
had
fallen
foul
upon
the
goddess
and
used
her
worse
than
a
common
strumpet
without
the
least
provocation
in
nature
i
popp
upon
smelfungus
again
at
turin
in
his
return
home
and
a
sad
tale
of
sorrowful
adventures
had
he
to
tell
he
spoke
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
and
of
the
cannibals
which
each
other
eat
the
anthropophagi
he
had
been
flayed
alive
and
bedevil
and
used
worse
than
bartholomew
at
every
stage
he
had
come
at
tell
it
cried
smelfungus
the
world
had
better
tell
it
said
i
your
physician
to
counteract
the
ill
effects
of
spleen
and
jaundice
and
exhibit
the
spirit
of
genteel
humour
and
universal
benevolence
in
which
a
man
of
sensibility
encountered
the
discomforts
of
the
road
the
incorrigible
parson
laurence
brought
out
his
own
sentimental
journey
another
effect
of
smollett
book
was
to
whet
his
own
appetite
for
recording
the
adventures
of
the
open
road
so
that
but
for
travels
through
france
and
italy
we
might
have
had
neither
a
sentimental
journey
nor
a
humphry
clinker
if
all
the
admirers
of
these
two
books
would
but
bestir
themselves
and
look
into
the
matter
i
am
sure
that
sterne
only
too
clever
assault
would
be
relegated
to
its
proper
place
and
assessed
at
its
right
value
as
a
mere
boutade
the
borrowed
contempt
of
horace
walpole
and
the
coterie
of
superficial
dilettanti
from
which
smollett
book
has
somehow
never
wholly
recovered
could
then
easily
be
outflanked
and
the
travels
might
well
be
in
reasonable
expectation
of
coming
by
their
own
again
ii
in
the
meantime
let
us
look
a
little
more
closely
into
the
special
and
somewhat
exceptional
conditions
under
which
the
travel
letters
of
smollett
were
produced
smollett
as
we
have
seen
was
one
of
the
first
professional
men
of
all
work
in
letters
upon
a
considerable
scale
who
subsisted
entirely
upon
the
earnings
of
his
own
pen
he
had
no
extraneous
means
of
support
he
had
neither
patron
pension
property
nor
endowment
inherited
or
acquired
yet
he
took
upon
himself
the
burden
of
a
large
establishment
he
spent
money
freely
and
he
prided
himself
upon
the
fact
that
he
tobias
smollett
who
came
up
to
london
without
a
stiver
in
his
pocket
was
in
ten
years
time
in
a
position
to
enact
the
part
of
patron
upon
a
considerable
scale
to
the
crowd
of
inferior
denizens
of
grub
street
like
most
people
whose
social
ambitions
are
in
advance
of
their
time
smollett
suffered
considerably
on
account
of
these
novel
aspirations
of
his
in
the
present
day
he
would
have
had
his
motor
car
and
his
house
on
hindhead
a
seat
in
parliament
and
a
brief
from
the
nation
to
boot
as
a
member
for
humanity
voltaire
was
the
only
figure
in
the
eighteenth
century
even
to
approach
such
a
flattering
position
and
he
was
for
many
years
a
refugee
from
his
own
land
smollett
was
energetic
and
ambitious
enough
to
start
in
rather
a
grand
way
with
a
large
house
a
carriage
menservants
and
the
rest
his
wife
was
a
fine
lady
a
creole
beauty
who
had
a
small
dot
of
her
own
but
on
the
other
hand
her
income
was
very
precarious
and
she
herself
somewhat
of
a
silly
and
an
incapable
in
the
eyes
of
smollett
old
scotch
friends
but
to
maintain
such
a
position
to
keep
the
bailiffs
from
the
door
from
year
end
to
end
was
a
truly
herculean
task
in
days
when
a
newspaper
rate
of
remuneration
or
a
copyright
did
not
so
much
as
exist
and
when
reviews
sweated
their
writers
at
the
rate
of
a
guinea
per
sheet
of
pages
smollett
was
continually
having
recourse
to
loans
he
produced
the
eight
or
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
he
required
by
sheer
hard
writing
turning
out
his
history
of
england
his
voltaire
and
his
universal
history
by
means
of
long
spells
of
almost
incessant
labour
at
ruinous
cost
to
his
health
on
the
top
of
all
this
cruel
compiling
he
undertook
to
run
a
review
the
critical
a
magazine
the
british
and
a
weekly
political
organ
the
briton
a
charge
of
defamation
for
a
paragraph
in
the
nature
of
what
would
now
be
considered
a
very
mild
and
pertinent
piece
of
public
criticism
against
a
faineant
admiral
led
to
imprisonment
in
the
king
bench
prison
plus
a
fine
of
then
came
a
quarrel
with
an
old
friend
wilkes
not
the
least
vexatious
result
of
that
forlorn
championship
of
government
in
the
briton
and
finally
in
part
obviously
as
a
consequence
of
all
this
nervous
breakdown
a
succession
of
severe
catarrhs
premonitory
in
his
case
of
consumption
the
serious
illness
of
the
wife
he
adored
and
the
death
of
his
darling
the
little
boss
of
former
years
now
on
the
verge
of
womanhood
to
a
man
of
his
extraordinarily
strong
affections
such
a
series
of
ills
was
too
overwhelming
he
resolved
to
break
up
his
establishment
at
chelsea
and
to
seek
a
remedy
in
flight
from
present
evils
to
a
foreign
residence
dickens
went
to
hibernate
on
the
riviera
upon
a
somewhat
similar
pretext
though
fortunately
without
the
same
cause
as
far
as
his
health
was
concerned
now
note
another
very
characteristic
feature
of
these
travel
letters
smollett
went
abroad
not
for
pleasure
but
virtually
of
necessity
not
only
were
circumstances
at
home
proving
rather
too
much
for
him
but
also
like
stevenson
he
was
specifically
ordered
south
by
his
physicians
and
he
went
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
making
as
much
money
as
possible
out
of
his
travel
papers
in
his
case
he
wrote
long
letters
on
the
spot
to
his
medical
and
other
friends
at
home
when
he
got
back
in
the
summer
of
one
of
his
first
cares
was
to
put
the
letters
together
it
had
always
been
his
intention
carefully
to
revise
them
for
the
press
but
when
he
got
back
to
london
he
found
so
many
other
tasks
awaiting
him
that
were
so
far
more
pressing
that
this
part
of
his
purpose
was
but
very
imperfectly
carried
out
the
letters
appeared
pretty
much
as
he
wrote
them
their
social
and
documentary
value
is
thereby
considerably
enhanced
for
they
were
nearly
all
written
close
down
to
the
facts
the
original
intention
had
been
to
go
to
montpellier
which
was
still
i
suppose
the
most
popular
health
resort
in
southern
europe
the
peace
of
opened
the
way
and
this
brings
us
to
another
feature
of
distinction
in
regard
to
travels
typical
briton
perfervid
protestant
of
britain
most
protestant
period
and
insular
enrage
though
he
doubtless
was
smollett
had
knocked
about
the
world
a
good
deal
and
had
also
seen
something
of
the
continent
of
europe
he
was
not
prepared
to
see
everything
couleur
de
rose
now
his
was
quite
unlike
the
frame
of
mind
of
the
ordinary
who
partly
from
a
voluntary
optimism
and
partly
from
the
change
of
food
and
habit
the
exhilaration
caused
by
novel
surroundings
and
timidity
at
the
unaccustomed
sounds
he
hears
in
his
ears
is
determined
to
be
pleased
with
everything
very
temperamental
was
smollett
and
his
frame
of
mind
at
the
time
was
that
of
one
determined
to
be
pleased
with
nothing
we
know
little
enough
about
smollett
intime
only
the
other
day
i
learned
that
the
majority
of
smollett
portraits
are
not
presentments
of
the
novelist
at
all
but
ingeniously
altered
plates
of
george
washington
an
interesting
confirmation
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
recently
published
letters
of
charles
kirkpatrick
sharpe
to
robert
chambers
smollett
wore
black
cloaths
a
tall
man
and
extreamly
handsome
no
picture
of
him
is
known
to
be
extant
all
that
have
been
foisted
on
the
public
as
such
his
relations
disclaim
this
i
know
from
my
aunt
smollett
who
was
the
wife
of
his
nephew
and
resided
with
him
at
bath
but
one
thing
we
do
know
and
in
these
same
letters
if
confirmation
had
been
needed
we
observe
the
statement
repeated
namely
that
smollett
was
very
peevish
a
sardonic
satirical
and
indeed
decidedly
gloomy
mood
or
temper
had
become
so
habitual
in
him
as
to
transform
the
man
originally
gay
and
debonnair
his
native
character
had
been
so
overlaid
that
when
he
first
returned
to
scotland
in
his
own
mother
could
not
recognise
him
until
he
gave
over
glooming
and
put
on
his
old
bright
smile
a
pleasant
story
of
the
doctor
mother
is
given
in
the
same
letters
to
chambers
she
is
described
as
an
woman
with
a
high
nose
but
not
a
bad
temper
and
very
fond
of
the
cards
one
evening
an
edinburgh
bailie
who
was
a
tallow
chandler
paid
her
a
visit
come
awa
bailie
said
she
and
tak
a
trick
at
the
cards
troth
madam
i
hae
nae
siller
then
let
us
play
for
a
pound
of
candles
his
was
certainly
a
nervous
irritable
and
rather
censorious
temper
like
brattle
in
the
vicar
of
bulhampton
he
was
thinking
always
of
the
evil
things
that
had
been
done
to
him
with
the
pawky
and
philosophic
scots
of
his
own
day
robertson
hume
adam
smith
and
jupiter
carlyle
he
had
little
in
common
but
with
the
sour
and
mistrustful
james
mill
or
the
cross
and
querulous
carlyle
of
a
later
date
he
had
it
seems
to
me
a
good
deal
what
however
we
attribute
in
their
case
to
bile
or
liver
a
consecrated
usage
prescribes
that
we
must
in
the
case
of
smollett
accredit
more
particularly
to
the
spleen
whether
dyspeptic
or
splenetic
this
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
see
things
through
a
veil
of
pleasant
illusion
he
felt
under
no
obligation
whatever
to
regard
the
grand
tour
as
a
privilege
of
social
distinction
or
its
discomforts
as
things
to
be
discreetly
ignored
in
relating
his
experience
to
the
public
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
that
the
tourist
agencies
of
would
select
to
frame
their
advertisements
as
an
advocatus
diaboli
on
the
subject
of
travel
he
would
have
done
well
enough
and
yet
we
must
not
infer
that
the
magic
of
travel
is
altogether
eliminated
from
his
pages
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
witness
his
intense
enthusiasm
at
nimes
on
sight
of
the
maison
carree
or
the
pont
du
gard
the
passage
describing
his
entry
into
the
eternal
city
ours
was
the
road
by
which
so
many
heroes
returned
with
conquest
to
their
country
by
which
so
many
kings
were
led
captive
to
rome
and
by
which
the
ambassadors
of
so
many
kingdoms
and
states
approached
the
seat
of
empire
to
deprecate
the
wrath
to
sollicit
the
friendship
or
sue
for
the
protection
of
the
roman
people
or
the
enviable
account
of
the
alfresco
meals
which
the
party
discussed
in
their
coach
as
described
in
letter
viii
as
to
whether
smollett
and
his
party
of
five
were
exceptionally
unfortunate
in
their
experiences
must
be
left
an
open
question
at
the
tribunal
of
public
opinion
in
cold
blood
in
one
of
his
later
letters
he
summarised
his
continental
experience
after
this
wise
inns
cold
damp
dark
dismal
dirty
landlords
equally
disobliging
and
rapacious
servants
awkward
sluttish
and
slothful
postillions
lazy
lounging
greedy
and
impertinent
with
this
last
class
of
delinquents
after
much
experience
he
was
bound
to
admit
the
following
dilemma
if
you
chide
them
for
lingering
they
will
contrive
to
delay
you
the
longer
if
you
chastise
them
with
sword
cane
cudgel
or
horsewhip
he
defines
the
correctives
you
may
perceive
but
leaves
the
expletives
to
our
imagination
they
will
either
disappear
entirely
and
leave
you
without
resource
or
they
will
find
means
to
take
vengeance
by
overturning
your
carriage
the
only
course
remaining
would
be
to
allow
oneself
to
become
the
dupe
of
imposition
by
tipping
the
postillions
an
amount
slightly
in
excess
of
the
authorized
gratification
he
admits
that
in
england
once
between
the
devizes
and
bristol
he
found
this
plan
productive
of
the
happiest
results
it
was
unfortunate
that
upon
this
occasion
the
lack
of
means
or
slenderness
of
margin
for
incidental
expenses
should
have
debarred
him
from
having
recourse
to
a
similar
expedient
for
threepence
a
post
more
as
smollett
himself
avows
he
would
probably
have
performed
the
journey
with
much
greater
pleasure
and
satisfaction
but
the
situation
is
instructive
it
reveals
to
us
the
disadvantage
under
which
the
novelist
was
continually
labouring
that
of
appearing
to
travel
as
an
english
milord
en
grand
seigneur
and
yet
having
at
every
point
to
do
it
on
the
cheap
he
avoided
the
common
conveyance
or
diligence
and
insisted
on
travelling
post
and
in
a
berline
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
exceed
the
pourboire
for
the
postillions
he
would
have
meat
upon
maigre
days
yet
objected
to
paying
double
for
it
he
held
aloof
from
the
table
and
would
have
been
content
to
pay
three
francs
a
head
for
a
dinner
a
part
but
his
worst
passions
were
roused
when
he
was
asked
to
pay
not
three
but
four
now
smollett
himself
was
acutely
conscious
of
the
false
position
he
was
by
nature
anything
but
a
curmudgeon
on
the
contrary
he
was
if
i
interpret
him
at
all
aright
a
generous
type
of
man
like
a
majority
perhaps
of
the
really
he
shared
one
trait
with
the
closefisted
and
even
with
the
very
mean
rich
he
would
rather
give
away
a
crown
than
be
cheated
of
a
farthing
smollett
himself
had
little
of
the
traditional
scottish
thriftiness
about
him
but
the
people
among
whom
he
was
going
the
languedocians
and
ligurians
were
notorious
for
their
nearness
in
money
matters
the
result
of
all
this
could
hardly
fail
to
exacerbate
smollett
mood
and
to
aggravate
the
testiness
which
was
due
primarily
to
the
bitterness
of
his
struggle
with
the
world
and
secondarily
to
the
complaints
which
that
struggle
engendered
one
capital
consequence
however
and
one
which
specially
concerns
us
was
that
we
get
this
unrivalled
picture
of
the
seamy
side
of
foreign
travel
a
side
rarely
presented
with
anything
like
smollett
skill
to
the
student
of
the
grand
siecle
of
the
grand
tour
the
rubs
the
rods
the
crosses
of
the
road
could
in
fact
hardly
be
presented
to
us
more
graphically
or
magisterially
than
they
are
in
some
of
these
chapters
like
prior
fielding
shenstone
and
dickens
smollett
was
a
connoisseur
in
inns
and
innkeepers
he
knew
good
food
and
he
knew
good
value
and
he
had
a
mighty
keen
eye
for
a
rogue
there
may
it
is
true
have
been
something
in
his
manner
which
provoked
them
to
exhibit
their
worst
side
to
him
it
is
a
common
fate
with
angry
men
the
trials
to
which
he
was
subjected
were
momentarily
very
severe
but
as
we
shall
see
in
the
event
they
proved
a
highly
salutary
discipline
to
him
to
sum
up
then
smollett
travels
were
written
hastily
and
vigorously
by
an
expert
man
of
letters
they
were
written
ad
vivum
as
it
were
not
from
notes
or
embellished
recollections
they
were
written
expressly
for
money
down
they
were
written
rather
en
noir
than
couleur
de
rose
by
an
experienced
and
we
might
almost
perhaps
say
a
disillusioned
traveller
and
not
by
a
naif
or
a
niais
the
statement
that
they
were
to
a
certain
extent
the
work
of
an
invalid
is
of
course
true
and
explains
much
the
majority
of
his
correspondents
were
of
the
medical
profession
all
of
them
were
members
of
a
group
with
whom
he
was
very
intimate
and
the
letters
were
by
his
special
direction
to
be
passed
round
among
them
we
do
not
know
precisely
who
all
these
correspondents
of
smollett
were
but
most
of
them
were
evidently
doctors
and
among
them
without
a
doubt
john
armstrong
william
hunter
george
macaulay
and
above
all
john
moore
himself
an
authority
on
european
travel
governor
on
the
grand
tour
of
the
duke
of
hamilton
son
of
the
beautiful
duchess
author
of
zeluco
and
father
of
the
famous
soldier
smollett
old
chum
smellie
died
march
in
the
circumstances
bearing
in
mind
that
it
was
his
original
intention
to
prune
the
letters
considerably
before
publication
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
say
a
good
deal
about
the
state
of
his
health
his
letters
would
have
been
unsatisfying
to
these
good
people
had
he
not
referred
frequently
and
at
some
length
to
his
spirits
and
to
his
symptoms
an
improvement
in
which
was
the
primary
object
of
his
journey
and
his
two
years
sojourn
in
the
south
readers
who
linger
over
the
diary
of
fielding
dropsy
and
mrs
fielding
toothache
are
inconsistent
in
denouncing
the
luxury
of
detail
with
which
smollett
discusses
the
matter
of
his
imposthume
what
i
claim
for
the
present
work
is
that
in
the
first
place
to
any
one
interested
in
smollett
personality
it
supplies
an
unrivalled
key
it
is
moreover
the
work
of
a
scholar
an
observer
of
human
nature
and
by
election
a
satirist
of
no
mean
order
it
gives
us
some
characteristic
social
vignettes
some
portraits
of
the
road
of
an
unsurpassed
freshness
and
clearness
it
contains
some
historical
and
geographical
observations
worthy
of
one
of
the
shrewdest
and
most
sagacious
publicists
of
the
day
it
is
interesting
to
the
etymologist
for
the
important
share
it
has
taken
in
naturalising
useful
foreign
words
into
our
speech
it
includes
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
a
respectable
quantum
of
wisdom
fit
to
become
proverbial
and
several
passages
of
admirable
literary
quality
in
point
of
date
it
is
fortunate
for
the
writer
just
escaped
being
one
of
a
crowd
on
the
whole
i
maintain
that
it
is
more
than
equal
in
interest
to
the
journey
to
the
hebrides
and
that
it
deserves
a
very
considerable
proportion
of
the
praise
that
has
hitherto
been
lavished
too
indiscriminately
upon
the
voyage
to
lisbon
on
the
force
of
this
claim
the
reader
is
invited
to
constitute
himself
judge
after
a
fair
perusal
of
the
following
pages
i
shall
attempt
only
to
point
the
way
to
a
satisfactory
verdict
no
longer
in
the
spirit
of
an
advocate
but
by
means
of
a
few
illustrations
and
more
occasionally
amplifications
of
what
smollett
has
to
tell
us
iii
as
was
the
case
with
fielding
many
years
earlier
smollett
was
almost
broken
down
with
sedentary
toil
when
early
in
june
with
his
wife
two
young
ladies
the
two
girls
to
whom
she
acted
as
chaperon
and
a
faithful
servant
of
twelve
years
standing
who
in
the
spirit
of
a
scots
retainer
of
the
olden
time
refused
to
leave
his
master
a
good
testimonial
this
by
the
way
to
a
temper
usually
accredited
with
such
a
splenetic
sourness
he
crossed
the
straits
of
dover
to
see
what
a
change
of
climate
and
surroundings
could
do
for
him
on
other
grounds
than
those
of
health
he
was
glad
to
shake
the
dust
of
britain
from
his
feet
he
speaks
himself
of
being
traduced
by
malice
persecuted
by
faction
abandoned
by
false
patrons
complaints
which
will
remind
the
reader
perhaps
of
george
borrow
jeremiad
to
the
effect
that
he
had
been
beslavered
by
the
venomous
foam
of
every
sycophantic
lacquey
and
unscrupulous
renegade
in
the
three
kingdoms
but
smollett
griefs
were
more
serious
than
what
an
unkind
reviewer
could
inflict
he
had
been
fined
and
imprisoned
for
defamation
he
had
been
grossly
caricatured
as
a
creature
of
bute
the
north
british
favourite
of
george
whose
tenure
of
the
premiership
occasioned
riots
and
almost
excited
a
revolution
in
the
metropolis
yet
after
incurring
all
this
unpopularity
at
a
time
when
the
populace
of
london
was
more
inflamed
against
scotsmen
than
it
has
ever
been
before
or
since
and
having
laboured
severely
at
a
paper
in
the
ministerial
interest
and
thereby
aroused
the
enmity
of
his
old
friend
john
wilkes
smollett
had
been
unceremoniously
thrown
over
by
his
own
chief
lord
bute
on
the
ground
that
his
paper
did
more
to
invite
attack
than
to
repel
it
lastly
he
and
his
wife
had
suffered
a
cruel
bereavement
in
the
loss
of
their
only
child
and
it
was
partly
to
supply
a
change
from
the
scene
of
this
abiding
sorrow
that
the
present
journey
was
undertaken
the
first
stages
and
incidents
of
the
expedition
were
not
exactly
propitious
the
dover
road
was
a
byword
for
its
charges
the
via
alba
might
have
been
paved
with
the
silver
wrung
from
reluctant
and
indignant
passengers
smollett
characterized
the
chambers
as
cold
and
comfortless
the
beds
as
paultry
with
frowsy
a
favourite
word
the
cookery
as
execrable
wine
poison
attendance
bad
publicans
insolent
and
bills
extortion
concluding
with
the
grand
climax
that
there
was
not
a
drop
of
tolerable
malt
liquor
to
be
had
from
london
to
dover
smollett
finds
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
the
designation
of
a
den
of
thieves
as
applied
to
that
famous
port
where
as
a
german
lady
of
much
later
date
once
complained
they
boot
ze
bible
in
ze
bedroom
but
ze
devil
in
ze
bill
and
he
grizzles
lamentably
over
the
seven
guineas
apart
from
extras
which
he
had
to
pay
for
transport
in
a
folkestone
cutter
to
boulogne
mouth
having
once
arrived
at
boulogne
smollett
settled
down
regularly
to
his
work
as
descriptive
reporter
and
the
letters
that
he
wrote
to
his
friendly
circle
at
home
fall
naturally
into
four
groups
the
first
letters
from
ii
to
describe
with
hogarthian
point
prejudice
and
pungency
the
town
and
people
of
boulogne
the
second
group
letters
deal
with
the
journey
from
boulogne
to
nice
by
way
of
paris
lyon
nimes
and
montpellier
the
third
group
letters
is
devoted
to
a
more
detailed
and
particular
delineation
of
nice
and
the
nicois
the
fourth
letters
describes
the
italian
expedition
and
the
return
journey
to
boulogne
en
route
for
england
where
the
party
arrive
safe
home
in
july
smollett
account
of
boulogne
is
excellent
reading
it
forms
an
apt
introduction
to
the
narrative
of
his
journey
it
familiarises
us
with
the
milieu
and
reveals
to
us
in
smollett
a
man
of
experience
who
is
both
resolute
and
capable
of
getting
below

has
rarely
been
less
in
touch
with

than
it
was
at

even
then
however
there
were

of

apart
from

it
was
estimated
ten
years
after
smollett
sojourn
there
that
there
were
english
families
in

the
locality
has
of
course
always
been
a

place

smollett

fair
in
justifying

of
which
have
a
strong
medieval
suggestion
a
standard
of

slightly
more
distinguished

he
never
lets
us
forget
that
he
is
a
scholar
of
antiquity
a
man
of
education
and
a
speculative
philosopher
hence
his
references
to
celsus
and
hippocrates
and
his
ingenious
etymologies
of
wheatear
and
samphire
more
ingenious
in
the
second
case
than
sound
smollett
field
of
observation
had
been
wide
and
his
fund
of
exact
information
was
unusually
large
at
edinburgh
he
had
studied
medicine
under
monro
and
john
gordon
in
company
with
such
able
and
distinguished
men
as
william
hunter
cullen
pitcairn
gregory
and
armstrong
and
the
two
last
mentioned
were
among
his
present
correspondents
as
naval
surgeon
at
carthagena
he
had
undergone
experience
such
as
few
literary
men
can
claim
and
subsequently
as
compiler
reviewer
party
journalist
historian
translator
statistician
and
lexicographer
he
had
gained
an
amount
of
miscellaneous
information
such
as
falls
to
the
lot
of
very
few
minds
of
his
order
of
intelligence
he
had
recently
directed
the
compilation
of
a
large
universal
geography
or
gazetteer
the
carton
or
vivien
de
martin
if
those
days
hence
his
glib
references
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
laplanders
caffres
kamskatchans
and
other
recondite
types
of
breeding
his
imaginative
faculty
was
under
the
control
of
an
exceptionally
strong
and
retentive
memory
one
may
venture
to
say
indeed
without
danger
of
exaggeration
that
his
testimonials
as
regards
habitual
accuracy
of
statement
have
seldom
been
exceeded
despite
the
doctor
unflattering
portraits
of
frenchmen
babeau
admits
that
his
book
is
one
written
by
an
observer
of
facts
and
a
man
whose
statements
whenever
they
can
be
tested
are
for
the
most
part
singularly
exact
prouse
whose
knowledge
of
the
riviera
district
is
perhaps
almost
unequalled
out
of
france
makes
this
very
remarkable
statement
after
reading
all
that
has
been
written
by
very
clever
people
about
nice
in
modern
times
one
would
probably
find
that
for
exact
precision
of
statement
smollett
was
still
the
most
trustworthy
guide
a
view
which
is
strikingly
borne
out
by
schuyler
who
further
points
out
smollett
shrewd
foresight
in
regard
to
the
possibilities
of
the
cornice
road
and
of
cannes
and
san
remo
as
sanatoria
frankly
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
which
he
does
not
recognise
and
even
higher
testimonies
have
been
paid
to
topographical
accuracy
by
recent
historians
of
nice
and
its
neighbourhood
the
value
which
smollett
put
upon
accuracy
in
the
smallest
matters
of
detail
is
evinced
by
the
corrections
which
he
made
in
the
margin
of
a
copy
of
the
edition
of
the
travels
these
corrections
which
are
all
in
smollett
own
and
unmistakably
neat
handwriting
may
be
divided
into
four
categories
in
the
first
place
come
a
number
of
verbal
emendations
phrases
are
turned
inverted
and
improved
by
the
skilful
twist
of
the
pen
which
becomes
a
second
nature
to
the
trained
corrector
of
proofs
there
are
moreover
a
few
topographical
corrigenda
suggested
by
an
improved
knowledge
of
the
localities
mostly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
pisa
and
leghorn
where
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
corrections
were
made
upon
the
occasion
of
smollett
second
visit
to
italy
in
some
not
unimportant
errata
were
overlooked
thus
smollett
representation
of
the
droit
as
a
monstrous
and
intolerable
grievance
is
of
course
an
exaggeration
see
sentimental
journey
hill
burton
the
scot
abroad
and
luchaire
instit
de
france
on
his
homeward
journey
he
indicates
that
he
travelled
from
beaune
to
chalons
and
so
by
way
of
auxerre
to
dijon
the
right
order
is
chalons
beaune
dijon
auxerre
as
further
examples
of
the
zeal
with
which
smollett
regarded
exactitude
in
the
record
of
facts
we
have
his
diurnal
register
of
weather
during
his
stay
at
nice
and
the
picture
of
him
scrupulously
measuring
the
ruins
at
cimiez
with
packthread
in
the
second
place
come
a
number
of
english
renderings
of
the
citations
from
latin
french
and
italian
authors
most
of
these
from
the
latin
are
examples
of
smollett
own
skill
in
english
verse
making
thirdly
come
one
or
two
significant
admissions
of
overboldness
in
matters
of
criticism
as
where
he
retracts
his
censure
of
parnassus
in
letter
xxxiii
fourthly
and
these
are
of
the
greatest
importance
come
some
very
interesting
additional
notes
upon
the
buildings
of
pisa
upon
sir
john
hawkwood
tomb
at
florence
and
upon
the
congenial
though
recondite
subject
of
antique
roman
hygiene

in

in

clinker
after
smollett
death
his
books
were
for
the
most
part
sold
for
the
benefit
of
his
widow
no
use
was
made
of
his
corrigenda
for
twenty
years
or
so
the
travels
were
esteemed
and
referred
to
but
as
time
went
on
owing
to
the
sneers
of
the
fine
gentlemen
of
letters
such
as
walpole
and
sterne
they
were
by
degrees
disparaged
and
fell
more
or
less
into
neglect
they
were
reprinted
it
is
true
either
in
collective
editions
of
smollett
or
in
various
collections
of
travels
for
instance
in
baldwin
edition
of
in
the
vol
of

of

but
they
were
not
edited
with
any
care
and
as
is
inevitable
in
such
cases
errors
crept
in
blunders
were
repeated
and
the
text
slightly
but
gradually
deteriorated
in
the
last
century
smollett
own
copy
of
the
travels
bearing
the
manuscript
corrections
that
he
had
made
in
was
discovered
in
the
possession
of
the
telfer
family
and
eventually
came
into
the
british
museum
the
second
volume
which
affords
admirable
specimens
of
smollett
neatly
written
marginalia
has
been
exhibited
in
a
in
the
king
library
the
corrections
that
smollett
purposed
to
make
in
the
travels
are
now
for
the
second
time
embodied
in
a
printed
edition
of
the
text
at
the
same
time
the
text
has
been
collated
with
the
original
edition
of
and
the
whole
has
been
carefully
revised
the
old
spelling
has
been
as
far
as
possible
restored
smollett
was
punctilious
in
such
matters
and
what
with
his
histories
his
translations
his
periodicals
and
his
other
compilations
he
probably
revised
more
for
press
than
any
other
writer
of
his
time
his
practice
as
regards
orthography
is
therefore
of
some
interest
as
representing
what
was
in
all
probability
deemed
to
be
the
most
enlightened
convention
of
the
day
to
return
now
to
the
doctor
immediate
contemplation
of
boulogne
a
city
described
in
the
itineraries
as
containing
rien

the
story
of
the
capuchin
on

a
capuchin
of
the
same
stripe
is
in

ch
ill
sq
is
very
racy
of
smollett
while
the
vignette
of
the
shepherd
at
the
beginning
of
letter
affords
a
illustration
of
his
terseness
appreciate
the
keen
and
minute
observation
concentrated
into
the
pages
that
follow
especially
on
to
p
commencing
with
the
shrewd
and
economic
remarks
upon
smuggling
and
ending
with
the
lively
description
of
a
boulonnais
banquet
very
amusing
very
french
very
and
very
smollettian
in
letter
the
doctor
again
is
very
much
himself
a
little
provocation
and
he
bristles
and
stabs
all
round
he
mounts
the
hygienic
horse
and
proceeds
from
the
lack
of
implements
of
cleanliness
to
the
lack
of
common
decency
and
high
flavoured
instances
at
which
even
a
native
of
edinburgh
would
stop
his
nose
this
recalls
johnson
first
walk
up
the
high
street
edinburgh
on
bozzy

it
was
a
dusky
night
i
could
not
prevent
his
being
assailed
by
the
evening
effluvia
of
edinburgh
as
we
marched
along
he
grumbled
in
my
ear
smell
you
in
the
dark
and
then
lest
the
southrons
should
escape
we
have
a
reference
to
the
beastly
habit
of
drinking
from
a
tankard
in
which
perhaps
a
dozen
filthy
mouths
have
slabbered
as
is
the
custom
in
england
with
all
his
coarsenesses
this
blunt
scot
was
a
pioneer
and
fugleman
of
the
niceties
between
times
most
nations
are
gibbetted
in
this
slashing
epistle
the
ingenious
boasting
of
the
french
is
well
hit
off
in
the
observation
of
the
chevalier
that
the
english
doubtless
drank
every
day
to
the
health
of
the
marquise
de
pompadour
the
implication
reminded
smollett
of
a
narrow
escape
from
a
duello
an
institution
he
reprobates
with
the
utmost
trenchancy
in
this
book
at
ghent
in
with
a
frenchman
who
affirmed
that
battles
were
purposely
lost
by
the
french
generals
in
order
to
mortify
mme
de
maintenon
two
incidents
of
some
importance
to
smollett
occurred
during
the
three
months
sojourn
at
boulogne
through
the
intervention
of
the
english
ambassador
at
paris
the
earl
of
hertford
he
got
back
his
books
which
had
been
impounded
by
the
customs
as
likely
to
contain
matter
prejudicial
to
the
state
or
religion
of
france
and
had
them
sent
south
by
shipboard
to
bordeaux
secondly
he
encountered
general
paterson
a
friendly
scot
in
the
sardinian
service
who
confirmed
what
an
english
physician
had
told
smollett
to
the
effect
that
the
climate
of
nice
was
infinitely
preferable
to
that
of
montpellier
with
respect
to
disorders
of
the
breast
smollett
now
hires
a
berline
and
four
horses
for
fourteen
louis
and
sets
out
with
rather
a
heavy
heart
for
paris
it
is
problematic
he
assures
his
good
friend
moore
whether
he
will
ever
return
my
health
is
very
precarious
iv
the
rapid
journey
to
paris
by
way
of
montreuil
amiens
and
clermont
about
one
hundred
and
miles
from
boulogne
the
last
over
a
paved
road
was
favourable
to
superficial
observation
and
the
normal
corollary
of
epigram
smollett
was
much
impressed
by
the
mortifying
indifference
of
the
french
innkeepers
to
their
clients
it
is
a
very
odd
contrast
between
france
and
england
in
the
former
all
the
people
are
complaisant
but
the
publicans
in
the
latter
there
is
hardly
any
complaisance
but
among
the
publicans
in
regard
to
two
exceptional
instances
of
politeness
on
the
part
of
innkeepers
smollett
attributes
one
case
to
dementia
the
other
at
lerici
to
mental
shock
caused
by
a
recent
earthquake
idleness
and
dissipation
confront
the
traveller
not
such
a
good
judge
perhaps
as
was
arthur
young
years
later
every
object
seems
to
have
shrunk
in
its
dimensions
since
i
was
last
in
paris
smollett
was
an
older
man
by
fifteen
years
since
he
visited
the
french
capital
in
the
first
flush
of
his
success
as
an
author
the
dirt
and
gloom
of
french
apartments
even
at
versailles
offend
his
english
standard
of
comfort
after
all
it
is
in
england
only
where
we
must
look
for
cheerful
apartments
gay
furniture
neatness
and
convenience
there
is
a
strange
incongruity
in
the
french
genius
with
all
their
volatility
prattle
and
fondness
for
bons
mots
they
delight
in
a
species
of
drawling
melancholy
church
music
their
most
favourite
dramatic
pieces
are
almost
without
incident
and
the
dialogue
of
their
comedies
consists
of
moral
insipid
apophthegms
entirely
destitute
of
wit
or
repartee
while
amusing
himself
with
the
sights
of
paris
smollett
drew
up
that
caustic
delineation
of
the
french
character
which
as
a
study
in
calculated
depreciation
has
rarely
been
surpassed
he
conceives
the
frenchman
entirely
as
a
and
his
view
though
far
removed
from
chesterfield
is
not
incompatible
with
that
of
many
of
his
cleverest
contemporaries
including
sterne
he
conceives
of
the
typical
frenchman
as
regulating
his
life
in
accordance
with
the
claims
of
impertinent
curiosity
and
foppery
gallantry
and
gluttony
thus
if
a
frenchman
is
capable
of
real
friendship
it
must
certainly
be
the
most
disagreeable
present
he
can
possibly
make
to
a
man
of
a
true
english
character
you
know
madam
we
are
naturally
taciturn
soon
tired
of
impertinence
and
much
subject
to
fits
of
disgust
your
french
friend
intrudes
upon
you
at
all
hours
he
stuns
you
with
his
loquacity
he
teases
you
with
impertinent
questions
about
your
domestic
and
private
affairs
he
attempts
to
meddle
in
all
your
concerns
and
forces
his
advice
upon
you
with
the
most
unwearied
importunity
he
asks
the
price
of
everything
you
wear
and
so
sure
as
you
tell
him
undervalues
it
without
hesitation
he
affirms
it
is
in
a
bad
taste
ill
contrived
ill
made
that
you
have
been
imposed
upon
both
with
respect
to
the
fashion
and
the
price
that
the
marquis
of
this
or
the
countess
of
that
has
one
that
is
perfectly
elegant
quite
in
the
bon
ton
and
yet
it
cost
her
little
more
than
you
gave
for
a
thing
that
nobody
would
wear
if
a
frenchman
is
admitted
into
your
family
and
distinguished
by
repeated
marks
of
your
friendship
and
regard
the
first
return
he
makes
for
your
civilities
is
to
make
love
to
your
wife
if
she
is
handsome
if
not
to
your
sister
or
daughter
or
niece
if
he
suffers
a
repulse
from
your
wife
or
attempts
in
vain
to
debauch
your
sister
or
your
daughter
or
your
niece
he
will
rather
than
not
play
the
traitor
with
his
gallantry
make
his
addresses
to
your
grandmother
and
ten
to
one
but
in
one
shape
or
another
he
will
find
means
to
ruin
the
peace
of
a
family
in
which
he
has
been
so
kindly
entertained
what
he
can
not
accomplish
by
dint
of
compliment
and
personal
attendance
he
will
endeavour
to
effect
by
reinforcing
these
with
songs
and
verses
of
which
he
always
makes
a
provision
for
such
purposes
if
he
is
detected
in
these
efforts
of
treachery
and
reproached
with
his
ingratitude
he
impudently
declares
that
what
he
had
done
was
no
more
than
simple
gallantry
considered
in
france
as
an
indispensable
duty
on
every
man
who
pretended
to
good
breeding
nay
he
will
even
affirm
that
his
endeavours
to
corrupt
your
wife
or
deflower
your
daughter
were
the
most
genuine
proofs
he
could
give
of
his
particular
regard
for
your
family
if
there
were
five
hundred
dishes
at
table
a
frenchman
will
eat
of
all
of
them
and
then
complain
he
has
no
appetite
this
i
have
several
times
remarked
a
friend
of
mine
gained
a
considerable
wager
upon
an
experiment
of
this
kind
the
ate
of
fourteen
different
plates
besides
the
dessert
then
disparaged
the
cook
declaring
he
was
no
better
than
a
marmiton
or
turnspit
the
gross
unfairness
no
less
than
the
consummate
cleverness
of
this
caricature
compels
us
to
remember
that
this
was
written
in
the
most
insular
period
of
our
manners
and
during
a
brief
lull
in
a
century
of
almost
incessant
mutual
hostility
between
the
two
nations
aristocrats
like
walpole
gibbon
and
chesterfield
could
regard
france
from
a
cosmopolitan
point
of
view
as
leading
the
comite
of
nations
but
to
sturdy
and
patriots
such
as
hogarth
and
smollett
reciprocal
politeness
appeared
as
grotesque
as
an
exchange
of
amenities
would
be
between
a
cormorant
and
an
ape
consequently
it
was
no
doubt
with
a
sense
of
positive
relief
to
his
feelings
that
smollett
could
bring
himself
to
sum
up
the
whole
matter
thus
a
frenchman
lays
out
his
whole
revenue
upon
taudry
suits
of
cloaths
or
in
furnishing
a
magnificent
repas
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
dishes
of
which
are
not
eatable
or
intended
to
be
eaten
his
wardrobe
goes
to
the
fripier
his
dishes
to
the
dogs
and
himself
to
the
devil
these
trenchant
passages
were
written
partly
it
may
be
imagined
to
suit
the
english
taste
of
the
day
in
that
object
they
must
have
succeeded
for
they
were
frequently
transcribed
into
contemporary
periodicals
in
extenuation
of
smollett
honesty
of
purpose
however
it
may
be
urged
that
he
was
always
a
thoroughgoing
patriot
witness
his
violently
play
the
reprisal
of
and
that
coming
from
a
calvinistic
country
where
a
measure
of
tartufism
was
a
necessary
condition
of
respectability
he
reproduces
the
common
english
error
of
ignoring
how
apt
a
frenchman
is
to
conceal
a
number
of
his
best
qualities
two
other
considerations
deserve
attention
the
was
in
smollett
day
at
the
very
height
of
its
disreputable
reign
secondly
we
must
remember
how
very
profoundly
french
character
has
been
modified
since
and
more
especially
in
consequence
of
the
cataclysms
of
and
smollett
vis
comica
is
conspicuous
in
the
account
of
the
coiffure
of
the
period
and
of
the
superstitious
reverence
which
a
frenchman
of
that
day
paid
to
his
hair
in
tracing
the
origin
of
this
superstition
he
exhibits
casually
his
historical
learning
the
crine
profuso
and
barba
demissa
of
the
reges
crinitos
as
the
merovingians
were
called
are
often
referred
to
by
ancient
chroniclers
long
hair
was
identified
with
right
of
succession
as
a
mark
of
royal
race
and
the
maintenance
of
ancient
tradition
a
tondu
signified
a
slave
and
even
under
the
carolingians

shave
a
prince

to
affirm
his
exclusion

little

that

at
their
utmost
speed
achieved
the
distance
between
rome
and

in
an
almost
precisely
similar
space
of
time
smollett
decided
to
travel
post
between
paris
and
lyons
and
he
found
that
the
journey
lasted
full
five
days
and
cost
upwards
of
thirty
guineas

more
than

been
acquired
by
the

museum
on
the

arnold

on
modern

there
was
a
choice
between
two
the
shorter
route
by
nevers
and
moulins
amounted
to
just
about
three
hundred
english
miles
the
longer
route
by
auxerre
and
dijon
which
smollett
preferred
extended
to
three
hundred
and
thirty
miles
the
two
roads
diverged
after
passing
fontainebleau
the
shorter
by
nemours
and
the
longer
by
moret
the
first
road
was
the
smoother
but
apart
from
the
chance
of
seeing
the
vendange
the
route
de
burgoyne
was
far
the
more
picturesque
smollett
portraiture
of
the
peasantry
in
the
less
cultivated
regions
prepares
the
mind
for
famous
description
of
those
gaunt
emblems
of
famine

the
doctor
says
i
saw
a
peasant
ploughing

jackass
a
lean
cow
and
a

together
his
vignette
of
the
fantastic
at
sens
and
his
own
abominable
rudeness
is
worthy
of
the
master

that
drew
the
poor
debtor
jackson
in
the
marshalsea
in
roderick

his
frank
avowal
of
ill
temper
at
the
time
deprives
our
entertainment
of
the
unamiable
tinge
of
which
it
would
otherwise
have
partaken
the
truth
is
i
was
that
day
more
than
usually
peevish
from
the
bad
weather
as
well
as
from
the
dread
of
a
fit
of
asthma
with
which
i
was
threatened
and
i
daresay
my
appearance
seemed
as
uncouth
to
him
as
his
travelling
dress
appeared
to
me
i
had
a
grey
mourning
frock
under
a
wide
greatcoat
a
without
powder
a
very
large
laced
hat
and
a
meagre
wrinkled
discontented
countenance

he
turned
out
to
be
an
proved
himself
the
one
frenchman
upon
whose
fidelity
and
good
service
smollett
could
look
back
with
unfeigned
satisfaction
the
sight
of
a
skeleton
dangling
from
a
gibbet
near
valence
surprised
from
this
droll
knave
an
ejaculation
and
a
story
from
which
it
appeared
only
too
evident
that
he
had
been
first
the
comrade
and
then
the
executioner
of
one
of
the
most
notorious
brigands
of
the
century
the
story
as
told
by
smollett
does
not
wholly
agree
with
the
best
authenticated
particulars
the
dick

of

engendered
almost
as

him

deserted
from

accordingly
and
got
together
a
gang
of
contrebandiers
at
the
head
of

his
career

almost
resembles

were
thrown
into

him
and
one
of
these
obtained
his
pardon
on
condition
of
acting
as

alas
poor
joseph
three
experiences
smollett
had
at
this
season
which
may
well
fall
to
the
lot
of
in
france
right
down
to
the
present
day
he
was
poisoned
with
garlic
surfeited
with
small
birds
and
astonished
at
the
solid
fare
of
the
poorest
looking
travellers
the
summer
weather
romantic
scenery
and
occasional
picnics
which
smollett
would
have
liked
to
repeat
every
summer
under
the
arches
of
the
pont
du
gard
the
monument
of
antiquity
which
of
all
excepting
only
the
maison
carree
at
nimes
most
excited
his
enthusiastic
admiration
all
contributed
to
put
him
into
an
abnormally
cheerful
and
convalescent
humour
smollett
now
bent
his
steps
southwards
to
montpellier
his
baggage
had
gone
in
advance
he
was
uncertain
as
yet
whether
to
make
montpellier
or
nice
his
headquarters
in
the
south
like
toulouse
and
tours
and
turin
montpellier
was
for
a
period
a
mecca
to
english
health
and
pleasure
seekers
abroad
a
city
of
no
great
antiquity
but
celebrated
from
the
twelfth
century
for
its
schools
of
law
and
physic
it
had
been
incorporated
definitely
with
france
since
and
its
name
recurs
in
french
history
both
as
the
home
of
famous
men
in
great
number
and
as
before
and
after

from
crossing
the

john

spent
two
winters
there
in
the
days
of
charles

and
may
have
pondered
a
good
many
of
the
problems
of
toleration
on
a
soil
under
which
the
heated
lava
of
religious
strife
was
still
unmistakeable
and
smollett
must
almost
have
jostled
en
route
against
the
celebrated
author
of
the
wealth
of
nations
who
set
out
with
his
pupil
for
toulouse
in
february
a
letter
to

speaks
of
the

lomenie

then
in
residence
as
archbishop
in
the
following
november
adam
smith
and
his
charge
paid
a
visit
to
montpellier
to
witness
a
pageant
and
memorial
as
it
was
supposed
of
a
freedom
that
was
gone
for
ever
the
opening
of
the
states
of

antiquaries
and
philosophers
went
to
moralise
on
the
spectacle
in
the
spirit
in
which
freeman
went
to
andorra
byron
to
the
site
of
troy
or
de
tocqueville
to
america
it
was
there
that
the
great
economist
met
horne
tooke
smollett
more
practical
and
immediate
object
in
making
this
pilgrimage
was
to
interview
the
great
lung
specialist
known
locally
to
his
admiring
compatriots
as
the
boerhaave
of
montpellier
fizes
the
medical
school
of
montpellier
was
much
in
evidence
during
the
third
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
for
the
history
of
its
various
branches
there
are
extant
numerous
memoires
pour
servir
by
prunelle
astruc
and
others
smollett
was
only
just
in
time
to
consult
the
reigning
oracle
for
the
illustrious
fizes
died
in
the
following
year
he
gives
us
a
very
unfavourable
picture
of
this
great
lanthorn
of
medicine
who
notwithstanding
his
prodigious
age
his
stoop
and
his
wealth
could
still
scramble
up
two
pairs
for
a
fee
of
six
livres
more
than
is
the
case
with
most
medical
patients
however
should
we
suspect
smollett
of
being
unduly
captious
the
point
as
to
how
far
his
sketch
of
the
french
doctor
and
his
diagnosis
was
a
true
one
and
how
far
a
mere
caricature
due
to
ill
health
and
prejudice
has
always
piqued
my
curiosity
but
how
to
resolve
a
question
involving
so
many
problems
not
of
ordinary
therapeutic
but
of
historical
medicine
in
this
difficulty
i
bethought
me
most
fortunately
of
consulting
an
authority
probably
without
a
rival
in
this
special
branch
of
medical
history
norman
moore
who
with
his
accustomed
generosity
has
given
me
the
following
most
instructive
diagnosis
of
the
whole
situation
i
have
read
smollett
account
of
his
illness
as
it
appears
in
several
passages
in
his
travels
and
in
the
statement
which
he
drew
up
for
professor
at
montpellier
smollett
speaks
of
his
pulmonic
disorder
his
disorder
and
uses
other
expressions
which
show
that
his
lungs
were
affected
in
his
statement
he
mentions
that
he
has
cough
shortness
of
breath
wasting
a
purulent
expectoration
loss
of
appetite
at
times
loss
of
strength
fever
a
rapid
pulse
intervals
of
slight
improvement
and
subsequent
exacerbations
this
shortness
of
breath
he
says
has
steadily
increased
this
group
of
symptoms
makes
it
certain
that
he
had
tuberculosis
of
the
lungs
in
other
words
was
slowly
progressing
in
consumption
his
darting
pains
in
his
side
were
due
to
the
pleurisy
which
always
occurs
in
such
an
illness
his
account
shows
also
the
absence
of
hopelessness
which
is
a
characteristic
state
of
mind
in
patients
with
pulmonary
tuberculosis
i
do
not
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
montpellier
professor
deserves
smollett
condemnation
it
seems
to
me
both
careful
and
sensible
and
contains
all
the
knowledge
of
its
time
smollett
with
an
inconsistency
not
uncommon
in
patients
who
feel
that
they
have
a
serious
disease
would
not
go
in
person
to
the
professor
for
he
felt
that
from
his
appearance
the
professor
would
be
sure
to
tell
him
he
had
consumption
he
half
hoped
for
some
other
view
of
the
written
case
in
spite
of
its
explicit
statements
and
when
professor
f
wrote
that
the
patient
had
tubercles
in
his
lungs
this
was
displeasing
to
poor
smollett
who
had
hoped
against
hope
to
receive
some
other
opinion
than
the
only
possible
one
that
he
undoubtedly
had
a
consumption
certain
to
prove
fatal
the
cruel
truth
was
not
to
be
evaded
smollett
had
tuberculosis
though
not
probably
of
the
most
virulent
kind
as
he
managed
to
survive
another
seven
years
and
those
for
the
most
part
years
of
unremitting
labour
he
probably
gained
much
by
substituting
nice
for
montpellier
as
a
place
to
winter
in
for
although
the
climate
of
montpellier
is
clear
and
bright
in
the
highest
degree
the
cold
is
both
piercing
and
treacherous
days
are
frequent
during
the
winter
in
which
one
may
stand
warmly
wrapped
in
the
brilliant
sun
and
feel
the
protection
of
a
greatcoat
no
more
than
that
of
a
piece
of
gauze
against
the
icy
and
penetrating
blast
that
comes
from
the
roof
of
france
unable
to
take
the
direct
route
by
arles
as
at
present
the
traveller
from
montpellier
in
had
to
make
a
northerly
detour
the
first
stone
bridge
up
the
rhone
was
at
avignon
but
there
was
a
bridge
of
boats
connecting
beaucaire
with
tarascon
thence
in
no
very
placable
mood
smollett
set
out
in
by
way
of
orgon
aix
brignolles
and
le
muy
striking
the
mediterranean
at
frejus
en
route
he
was
inveigled
into
a
controversy
of
unwonted
bitterness
with
an
innkeeper
at
le
muy
the
scene
is
conjured
up
for
us
with
an
almost
disconcerting
actuality
no
single
detail
of
the
author
discomfiture
is
omitted
the
episode
is
in
its
impersonal
detachment
or
as
coleridge
first
said
aloofness
on
crossing
the
var
the
sunny
climate
the
romantic
outline
of
the
esterelles
the
charms
of
the
neat
village
of
cannes
and
the
first
prospect
of
nice
began
gradually
and
happily
to
effect
a
slight
mitigation
in
our
patient
humour
smollett
was
indubitably
one
of
the
pioneers
of
the
promenade
des
anglais
long
before
the
days
of
antonio
or
lord
brougham
he
described
for
his
countrymen
the
almost
incredible
dolcezza
of
the
sunlit
coast
from
antibes
to
lerici
but
how
much
better
than
the
barren
triumph
of
being
the
unconscious
fugleman
of
so
glittering
a
popularity
must
have
been
the
sense
of
being
one
of
the
first
that
ever
burst
from
our
rude
island
upon
that
secluded
little
piedmontese
town
as
it
then
was
of
not
above
twelve
thousand
souls
with
its
wonderful
situation
noble
perspective
and
unparalleled
climate
well
might
our
doctor
exclaim
when
i
stand
on
the
rampart
and
look
around
i
can
scarce
help
thinking
myself
enchanted
it
was
truly
a
garden
of
armida
for
a
native
of
one
of
the
dampest
corners
of
north
britain
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
before
the
great
transformation
took
place
on
the
french
riviera
when
nizza
villafranca
and
mentone
were
antique
italian
towns
and
when
it
was
one
of
the
eccentricities
of
lord
brougham
to
like
cannes
all
that
was
a
delightful
land
only
a
hundred
years
ago
arthur
young
had
trouble
to
get
an
old
woman
and
a
donkey
to
carry
his
portmanteau
from
cannes
to
antibes
i
can
myself
remember
cannes
in
a
small
fishing
village
with
a
quiet
beach
and
mentone
a
walled
town
with
mediaeval
gates
and
a
castle
a
few
humble
villas
and
the
old
posta
to
give
supper
to
any
passing
traveller
it
was
one
of
the
loveliest
bits
of
italy
and
the
road
from
nizza
to
genoa
was
one
long
procession
for
four
days
of
glorious
scenery
historic
remnants
italian
colour
and
picturesque
ports
from
the
esterelles
to
san
remo
this
has
all
been
ruined
by
the
horde
of
northern
barbarians
who
have
made
a
sort
of
trouville
brighton
or
biarritz
with
american
hotels
and
parisian
boulevards
on
every
headland
and
bay
first
came
the
half
underground
railway
a
long
tunnel
with
lucid
intervals
which
destroyed
the
road
by
blocking
up
its
finest
views
and
making
it
practically
useless
then
miles
of
unsightly
caravanserais
high
walls
pompous
villas
and
parisian
grandes
rues
crushed
out
every
trace
of
italy
of
history
and
pictorial
charm
so
writes
frederic
harrison
of
this
delectable
coast
in
the
daily
chronicle
march
as
it
was
at
a
period
within
his
own
recollection
a
period
at
which
it
is
hardly
fanciful
to
suppose
men
living
who
might
just
have
remembered
smollett
as
he
was
in
his
last
days
when
he
returned
to
die
on
the
riviera
di
levante
in
the
autumn
of
travel
had
then
still
some
of
the
elements
of
romance
rapidity
has
changed
all
that
the
trouble
is
that
although
we
can
transport
our
bodies
so
much
more
rapidly
than
smollett
could
our
understanding
travels
at
the
same
old
pace
as
before
and
in
the
meantime
railway
and
tourist
agencies
have
made
of
modern
travel
a
kind
of
mental
postcard
album
with
grand
hotels
on
one
side
hotel
menus
on
the
other
and
a
faint
aroma
of
continental
trains
haunting
between
the
leaves
as
it
were
our
real
knowledge
is
still
limited
to
the
country
we
have
walked
over
and
we
must
not
approach
the
country
we
would
appreciate
faster
than
a
man
may
drive
a
horse
or
propel
a
bicycle
or
we
shall
lose
the
sense
of
artistic
approach
even
to
cross
the
channel
by
is
fatal
to
that
romantic
spirit
indispensable
to
the
true
magic
of
travel
which
a
slow
adjustment
of
the
mind
to
a
new
social
atmosphere
and
a
new
historical
environment
alone
can
induce
ruskin
the
last
exponent
of
the
grand
tour
said
truly
that
the
benefit
of
travel
varies
inversely
in
proportion
to
its
speed
the
cheap
rapidity
which
has
made
our
villes
de
plaisir
and
cotes
what
they
are
has
made
unwieldy
boroughs
of
suburban
villages
and
what
the
rail
has
done
for
a
radius
of
a
dozen
miles
the
motor
is
rapidly
doing
for
one
of
a
score
so
are
we
sped
but
we
are
to
discuss
not
the
psychology
of
travel
but
the
immediate
causes
and
circumstances
of
smollett
arrival
upon
the
territory
of
nice
vi
smollett
did
not
interpret
the
of
the
history
of
nice
particularly
well
its
colonisation
from
massilia
its
long
connection
with
provence
its
occupation
by
saracens
its
stormy
connection
with
the
house
of
anjou
and
its
close
fidelity
to
the
house
of
savoy
made
no
appeal
to
his
admiration
the
most
important
event
in
its
recent
history
no
doubt
was
the
capture
of
the
city
by
the
french
under
catinat
in
louis
xiv
being
especially
exasperated
against
what
he
regarded
as
the
treachery
of
victor
amadeus
and
the
razing
to
the
ground
of
its
famous
citadel
the
city
henceforth
lost
a
good
deal
of
its
civic
dignity
and
its
morale
was
conspicuously
impaired
in
the
war
of
the
austrian
succession
an
english
fleet
under
admiral
matthews
was
told
off
to
defend
the
territory
of
the
nicois
against
the
attentions
of
toulon
this
was
the
first
close
contact
experienced
between
england
and
nice
but
the
impressions
formed
were
mutually
favourable
the
inhabitants
were
enthusiastic
about
the
unaccustomed
english
plan
of
paying
in
full
for
all
supplies
demanded
the
british
officers
were
no
less
delighted
with
the
climate
of
nice
the
fame
of
which
they
carried
to
their
northern
homes
it
was
both
directly
and
indirectly
through
one
of
these
officers
that
the
claims
of
nice
as
a
sanatorium
came
to
be
put
so
plainly
before
smollett
losing
its
prestige
as
a
ville
forte
nice
was
henceforth
rapidly
to
gain
the
new
character
of
a
ville
de
plaisir
in
says
one
of
the
historians
smollett
the
famous
historian
and
novelist
visited
nice
arriving
here
shattered
in
health
and
depressed
in
spirits
under
the
genial
influence
of
the
climate
he
soon
found
himself
a
new
man
his
notes
on
the
country
its
gardens
its
orange
groves
its
climate
without
a
winter
are
pleasant
and
just
and
would
seem
to
have
been
written
yesterday
instead
of
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
his
memory
is
preserved
in
the
street
nomenclature
of
the
place
one
of
the
thoroughfares
still
bears
the
appellation
of
rue
smollett
james
nash
the
guide
to
nice
p
among
other
celebrated
residents
at
nice
during
the
period
of
smollett
visit
were
edward
augustus
duke
of
york
the
brother
of
george
who
died
at
monaco
a
few
years
later
and
andre
massena
a
native
of
the
city
then
a
lad
of
six
before
he
left
montpellier
smollett
indulged
in
two
more
seemingly
irresistible
tirades
against
french
folly
one
against
their
persistent
of
such
a
stuffed
doll
as
louis
le
grand
and
the
second
in
ridicule
of
the
immemorial
french
panacea
a
bouillon
now
he
gets
to
nice
he
feels
a
return
of
the
craving
to
take
a
hand
turn
at
depreciatory
satire
upon
the
nation
of
which
a
contemporary
hand
was
just
tracing
the
deservedly
delineation
commencing
gay
sprightly
land
of
mirth
and
social
ease
pleas
with
thyself
whom
all
the
world
can
please
such
inveteracy
like
johnson
against
swift
was
not
unnaturally
suspected
by
friends
in
england
of
having
some
personal
motive
in
his
fifteenth
letter
home
therefore
smollett
is
assiduous
in
disclaiming
anything
of
the
kind
he
begins
by
attempting
an
amende
honorable
but
before
he
has
got
well
away
from
his
exordium
he
insensibly
and
most
characteristically
diverges
into
the
more
congenial
path
of
censure
and
expands
indeed
into
one
of
his
most
eloquent
passages
a
disquisition
upon
the
french
punctilio
conceived
upon
lines
somewhat
similar
to
mercutio
address
to
benvolio
to
which
is
appended
a
satire
on
the
duello
as
practised
in
france
which
glows
and
burns
with
a
radiation
of
good
sense
racy
of
smollett
at
his
best
to
eighteenth
century
lovers
the
discussion
on
duelling
will
recall
similar
talks
between
boswell
and
johnson
or
that
between
the
lieutenant
and
tom
in
the
seventh
book
of
tom
jones
but
more
particularly
the
sermon
delivered
by
johnson
on
this
subject
a
propos
of
general
oglethorpe
story
of
how
he
avoided
a
duel
with
prince
eugene
in
we
were
sitting
in
company
at
table
whence
the
prince
took
up
a
glass
of
wine
and
by
a
fillip
made
some
of
it
fly
in
oglethorpe
face
here
was
a
nice
dilemma
to
have
challenged
him
instantly
might
have
fixed
a
quarrelsome
character
upon
the
young
soldier
to
have
taken
no
notice
of
it
might
have
been
counted
as
cowardice
oglethorpe
therefore
keeping
his
eye
on
the
prince
and
smiling
all
the
time
as
if
he
took
what
his
highness
had
done
in
jest
said
mon
prince
i
forget
the
french
words
he
used
that
a
good
joke
but
we
do
it
much
better
in
england
and
threw
a
whole
glass
of
wine
in
the
prince
face
an
old
general
who
sat
by
said
il
a
bien
fait
mon
prince
vous
commence
and
thus
all
ended
in
good
humour
in
letter
xiii
smollett
settles
down
to
give
his
correspondents
a
detailed
description
of
the
territory
and
people
of
nice
at
one
time
it
was
his
intention
to
essay
yet
another
branch
of
authorship
and
to
produce
a
monograph
on
the
natural
history
antiquities
and
topography
of
the
town
as
the
capital
of
this
still
unfamiliar
littoral
with
the
modesty
of
experience
however
he
recoils
from
a
task
to
which
he
does
not
feel
his
opportunities
altogether
adequate
see
p
a
quarter
of
smollett
original
material
would
embarrass
a
guide
of
more
recent
pattern
whenever
he
got
near
a
coast
line
smollett
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
decided
views
if
he
had
lived
at
the
present
day
he
would
infallibly
have
been
a
naval
expert
better
informed
than
most
and
more
trenchant
than
all
but
recognizably
one
of
the
species
artist
in
words
and
amateur
of
smollett
had
of
course
been
surgeon
mate
on
cumberland
his
first
curiosity
at
nice
was
raised
concerning
the
port
the
harbour
the
galleys
moored
within
the
mole
and
the
naval
policy
of
his
sardinian
majesty
his
advice
to
victor
amadeus
was
no
doubt
as
excellent
and
as
unregarded
as
the
advice
of
naval
experts
generally
is
of
more
interest
to
us
is
his
account
of
the
among
the
miserable
slaves
whom
a
british
subject
can
not
behold
without
horror
and
compassion
he
observes
a
piedmontese
count
in
turkish
attire
reminding
the
reader
of
one
of
dumas
stories
of
a
count
among
the
forcats
to
learn
that
there
were
always
volunteer
oarsmen
among
these
poor
outcasts
is
to
reflect
bitterly
upon
the
average
happiness
of
mankind
as
to
whether
they
wore
much
worse
off
than
common
seamen
in
the
british
navy
of
the
period
who
were
only
in
name
volunteers
and
had
often
no
hope
of
discharge
until
they
were
worn
out
under
such
commanders
as
oakum
or
whiffle
in
roderick
random

another
question

confirmation
of

a
subject
upon
which

tedious
smollett
settles
down
to
a
capable
historical
summary
preparatory
to
setting
his
palette
for
a
picture
of
the
nissards
as
they
are
he
was
as
we
are
aware
no
court
painter
and
the
cheerful
colours
certainly
do
not
predominate
the
noblesse
for
all
their
exclusiveness
can
not
escape
his
censure
he
can
see
that
they
are
poor
they
are
unable
to
boast
more
than
two
coaches
among
their
whole
number
and
he
feels
sure
that
they
are
depraved
he
attributes
both
vices
unhesitatingly
to
their
idleness
and
to
their
religion
in
their
singularly
unemotional
and
coolly
comparative
outlook
upon
religion
how
infinitely
nearer
were
fielding
and
smollett
than
their
greatest
successors
dickens

thackeray

the
modern
critic

observes
that
there
is
at

not
a
single
credible
established
religion
in
existence
to
smollett
catholicism
conjures
up
nothing
so
vividly
as
the
mask
of
comedy
while
his
native
calvinism
stands
for
the
corresponding
mask
of
tragedy
walpole
dictum
that
life
was
a
comedy
to
those
who
think

those

this
excellent
mot
of
smollett
religion
in
the
sunny
spaces
of
the
south
is
a
fund
of
pastime
the
mass
of
which
he
tells
a
story
that
reminds
us
of
lever
micky
free
is
just
a
mechanism
invented
by
clever
rogues
for
an
elaborate
system
of
petty
larceny
and
what
a
ferocious
vein
of
cynicism
underlies
his
strictures
upon
the
perverted
gallantry
of
the
mariolaters
at
florence
or
those
on
the
two
old
catholics
rubbing
their
ancient
gums
against
toe
for
toothache
at
rome
the
recurring
emblems
of
crosses
and
gibbets
simply
shock
him
as
mementoes
of
the
bagne
at
rome

compares
a
presentment
of
laurence
to
a
barbecued
pig
what
a
pity
it
is

complains
that
the
labours
of

shocking

so
on

remarks
upon

famous
pieta
of
michael

are
frank
to
the
point
of
brutality
the
right
of
sanctuary
and
its
infamous
prerogative
unheard
of
in
england
since
the
days
of
henry
were
still
capable
of
affording
a
lesson
to
the
scot
abroad

saw
a
fellow
who
had
three
days
before
murdered
his
wife
in
the
last
month
of
pregnancy
taking
the
air
with
great
composure
and
serenity
on
the
steps
of
a
church
in
florence
smollett
it
is
clear
for
all
his
philosophy
was
no
degenerate
representative
of
the
blind
unreasoning
detestation
of
popery
and
wooden
shoes
smollett
is
one
of
the
first
to
describe
a
conversazione
and
in
illustration
of
the
decadence
of
italian
manners
it
is
natural
that
he
should
have
a
good
deal
to
tell
us
about
the
cicisbeatura
his
account
of
the
cicisbeo
and
his
duties
whether
in
nice
florence
or
rome
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
that
we
have
before
smollett
and
his
almost
contemporary
travel
correspondent
samuel
sharp
it
would
probably
be
hard
to
find
any
mention
of
the
cicisbeo
in
england
though
the
word
was
consecrated
by
sheridan
a
few
years
later
most
of
the
classic
accounts
of
the
usage
such
as
those
by
mme
de
stael
stendhal
parini
byron
and
his
biographers
date
from
very
much
later
when
the
institution
was
long
past
its
prime
if
not
actually
moribund
now
smollett
saw
it
at
the
very
height
of
its
perfection
and
at
a
time
when
our
decorous
protestant
curiosity
on
such
themes
was
as
lively
as
lady
mary
montagu
had
found
it
in
the
case
of
fair
circassians
and
turkish
harems
just
thirty
years
previously
a
cicisbeo
was
a
dangler
hence
the
word
came
to
be
applied
punningly
to
the
bow
depending
from
a
clouded
cane
or
ornamental
crook
in
spain
home
of
the
sedan
and
the
caballero
galante
the
original
term
was
bracciere
in
venice
the
form
was
cavaliere
servente

a
good
note
on
the
subject
see
sismondi
italian
republics
ed
william
boulting
p
like
so
much
in
the
shapes
and
customs
of
italy
the
cicisbeatura
was
in
its
origin
partly
gothic
and
partly
oriental
it
combined
the
chivalry
of
northern
friendship
with
the
refined
passion
of
the
south
for
the
seclusion
of
women
as
an
experiment
in
protest
against
the
insipidity
which
is
too
often
an
accompaniment
of
conjugal
intercourse
the
institution
might
well
seem
to
deserve
a
more
tolerant
and
impartial
investigation
than
it
has
yet
received
at
the
hands
of
our
sociologists
a
survival
so
picturesque
could
hardly
be
expected
to
outlive
the
bracing
air
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
north
wind
blew
and
by
the
cicisbeatura
was
a
thing
of
the
past
freed
from
the
necessity
of
a
systematic
delineation
smollett
rambles
about
nice
its
length
and
breadth
with
a
stone
in
his
pouch
and
wherever
a
cockshy
is
available
he
takes
full
advantage
of
it
he
describes
the
ghetto
the
police
arrangements
of
the
place
which
he
finds
in
the
main
highly
efficient
and
the
cruel
punishment
of
the
strappado
the
garrucha
or
strappado
and
the
garrotes
combined
with
the
and
the
rack
represented
the
survival
of
the
fittest
in
the
natural
selection
of
torments
concerning
which
the
holy
office
in
italy
and
spain
had
such
a
vast
experience
the
strappado
as
described
by
smollett
however
is
a
more
severe
form
of
torture
even
than
that
practised
by
the
inquisition
and
we
can
only
hope
that
his
description
of
its
brutality
is
highly
coloured

smollett
must
have
enjoyed
himself
vastly
in
the
market
at
nice
he
gives
an
elaborate
and
epicurean
account
of
his
commissariat
during
the
successive
seasons
of
his
sojourn
in
the
neighbourhood
he
was
not
one
of
these
who
live
solely
below
the
diaphragm
but
he
understood
food
well
and
writes
about
it
with
a
catholic
gusto
and
relish
he
laments
the
rarity
of
small
birds
on
the
riviera
and
gives
a
highly
comic
account
of
the
chasse
of
this
species
of
gibier
he
has
a
good
deal
to
say
about
the
sardine
and
tunny
fishery
about
the
fruit
and
scent
traffic
and
about
the
wine
industry
and
he
gives
us
a
graphic
sketch
of
the
silkworm
culture
which
it
is
interesting
to
compare
with
that
given
by
locke
in
he
has
something
to
say
upon
the
general
agriculture
and
more
especially
upon
the
olive
and
oil
industry
some
remarks
upon
the
numerous
mummeries
and
festas
of
the
inhabitants
lead
him
into
a
long
digression
upon
the
feriae
of
the
romans
it
is
evident
from
this
that
the
box
of
books
which
he
shipped
by
way
of
bordeaux
must
have
been
plentifully
supplied
with
classical
literature
for
as
he
remarks
with
unaffected
horror
such
a
thing
as
a
bookseller
had
not
been
so
much
as
heard
of
in
nice
well
may
he
have
expatiated
upon
the
total
lack
of
taste
among
the
inhabitants
in
dealing
with
the
trade
revenue
and
other
administrative
details
smollett
shows
himself
the
expert
compiler
and
statistician
a
london
journalist
in
large
practice
credits
himself
with
becoming
by
the
mere
exercise
of
his
vocation

always
been
one
of
his
hobbies
and
on
learning
that
none
of
the
local
practitioners
was
in
a
position
to
exact
a
larger
fee
than
sixpence
from
his
patients
quantum
mutatus
the
nice
physician
of
he
felt
that
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
make
this
the
subject
of
an
independent
investigation
he
kept
a
register
of
the
weather
during
the
whole
of
his
stay
and
his
remarks
upon
the
subject
are
still
of
historical
interest
although
with
teysseire
minutely
exact
monograph
on
the
climatology
of
nice
at
his
disposal
and
innumerable
commentaries
thereon
by
specialists
the
inquirer
of
would
hardly
go
to
smollett
for
his
data
then
as
now
it
is
curious
to
find
the
rumour
current
that
the
climate
of
nice
was
sadly
deteriorating
nothing
to
what
it
was
before
the
war
as
the
grumbler
from
the
south
was
once
betrayed
into
saying
of
the
august
moon
smollett
esprit
chagrin
was
nonplussed
at
first
to
find
material
for
complaint
against
a
climate
in
which
he
admits
that
there
was
less
rain
and
less
wind
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
that
he
knew
in
these
unwonted
circumstances
he
is
constrained
to
fall
back
on
the
hard
water
and
the
plague
of
cousins
or
gnats
as
affording
him
the
legitimate
grievance
in
whose
absence
the
warrior
soul
of
the
author
of
the
ode
to
independence
could
never
be
content
vii
for
his
autumn
holiday
in
smollett
decided
on
a
jaunt
to
florence
and
rome
returning
to
nice
for
the
winter
and
he
decided
to
travel
as
far
as
leghorn
by
sea
there
was
choice
between
several
kinds
of
small
craft
which
plied
along
the
coast
and
their
names
recur
with
cheerful
frequency
in
the
pages
of
marryat
and
other
depictors
of
the
mediterranean
there
was
the
felucca
an
open
boat
with
a
tilt
over
the
stern
large
enough
to
freight
a
and
propelled
by
ten
to
twelve
stout
mariners
to
commission
such
a
boat
to
genoa
a
distance
of
a
hundred
miles
cost
four
louis
as
alternative
there
was
the
tartane
a
sailing
vessel
with
a
lateen
sail
addison
sailed
from
marseilles
to
genoa
in
a
tartane
in
december
a
storm
arose
and
the
patron
alarmed
the
passengers
by
confessing
his
sins
and
such
sins
loudly
to
a
capuchin
friar
who
happened
to
be
aboard
smollett
finally
decided
on
a
gondola
with
four
rowers
and
a
steersman
for
which
he
had
to
pay
nine
sequins
louis
after
adventures
off
monaco
san
remo
noli
and
elsewhere
the
party
are
glad
to
make
the
famous
phones
on
the
torre
della
lanterna
of
which
banker
rogers
sings
in
his
mediocre
verse
thy
pharos
genoa
first
displayed
itself
burning
in
stillness
on
its
rocky
seat
that
guiding
star
so
oft
the
only
one
when
those
now
glowing
in
the
azure
vault
are
dark
and
silent
smollett
description
of
genoa
is
decidedly
more
interesting
he
arrived
at
a
moment
specially
propitious
to
so
sardonic
an
observer
for
the
republic
had
fallen
on
evil
times
having
escaped
from
the
clutches
of
austria
in
by
means
of
a
popular
riot
during
which
the
aristocracy
considerately
looked
the
other
way
only
to
fall
into
an
even
more
embarrassed
and
unheroic
position
of
so
diminutive
an
opponent
as
corsica
the
whole
story
is
a
curious
prototype
of
the
nineteenth
century
imbroglio
between
spain
and
cuba
of
commonplaces
about
the
palaces
fruitful
of
verbiage
in
addison
and
gray
who
says
with
perfect
truth
i
should
make
you
sick
of
marble
were
i
to
tell
you
how
it
is
lavished
here
smollett
is
sparing
enough
though
he
evidently
regards
the
inherited
inclination
of
genoese
noblemen
to
build
beyond
their
means
as
an
amiable
weakness
his
description
of
the
proud
old
genoese
nobleman
who
lives
in
marble
and
feeds
on
scraps
is
not
unsympathetic
and
suggests
that
the
deceipt
of
the
ligurians
which
virgil
censures
in
the
line
haud
ligurum
extremus
dum
fallere
fata
sinebant
may
possibly
have
been
of
this
balderstonian
variety
but
smollett
had
little
room
in
his
economy
for
such
vapouring
speculations
he
was
as
unsentimental
a
critic
as
sydney
smith
or
sir
leslie
stephen
he
wants
to
know
the
assets
of
a
place
more
than
its
associations
facts
figures
trade
and
revenue
returns
are
the
data
his
shrewd
mind
requires
to
feed
on
he
has
a
keen
eye
for
harbours
suitable
for
an
english
frigate
to
lie
up
in
and
can
hardly
rest
until
his
sagacity
has
collected
material
for
a
political
horoscope
smollett
remarks
upon
the
mysterious
dispensations
of
providence
in
regard
to
genoa
and
the
retreat
of
the
austrians
are
charged
to
the
full
with
his
saturnine
spirit
his
suspicions
were
probably
well
founded
ever
since
genoa
had
been
the
more
or
less
humiliated
satellite
of
france
and
her
once
famous
bank
had
been
bled
pretty
extensively
by
both
belligerents
the
senate
was
helpless
before
the
austrian
engineers
in
and
the
emancipation
of
the
city
was
due
wholly
to
a
popular
emeute
she
had
relapsed
again
into
a
completely
enervated
condition
smollett
thought
she
would
have
been
happier
under
british
protection
but
it
is
a
vicious
alternative
for
a
nation
to
choose
a
big
protector
it
was
characteristic
of
the
republic
that
from
to
its
policy
was
to
remain
neutral
the
crisis
in
regard
to
corsica
came
immediately
after
smollett
visit
when
in
under
their
doge
francesco
maria
rovere
the
genoese
offered
to
abandon
the
island
to
the
patriots
under
paoli
reserving
only
the
possession
of
the
two
loyal
of
bonifazio
and
calvi
see
corsica
at
paoli
instance
these
conciliatory
terms
were
refused
genoa
in
desperation
and
next
door
to
bankruptcy
resolved
to
sell
her
rights
as
suzerain
to
france
and
the
compact
was
concluded
by
a
treaty
signed
at
versailles
in
paoli
was
finally
defeated
at
ponte
novo
on
may
and
fled
to
england
on
august
the
edict
of
reunion
between
france
and
corsica
was
promulgated
on
the
same
day
napoleon
buonaparte
was
born
at
ajaccio
after
a
week
at
genoa
smollett
proceeded
along
the
coast
to
lerici
there
being
tired
of
the
sea
the
party
disembarked
and
proceeded
by
chaise
from
sarzano
to
cercio
in
modenese
territory
and
so
into
tuscany
then
under
the
suzerainty
of
austria
his
description
of
pisa
is
of
an
almost
sunny
gaiety
and
good
humour
italy
through
this
portal
was
capable
of
casting
a
spell
even
upon
a
traveller
so
as
smollett
the
very
churches
at
pisa
are
tolerably
ornamented
the
campo
santo
and
tower
fall
in
no
way
short
of
their
reputation
while
the
brass
gates
so
far
excel
theirs
that
smollett
could
have
stood
a
whole
day
to
examine
and
admire
them
these
agremens
may
be
attributable
in
some
measure
to
a
very
good
inn
in
stating
that
galleys
were
built
in
the
town
smollett
seems
to
have
fallen
a
victim
for
once
to
information
evelyn
mentions
that
galleys
were
built
there
in
his
time
but
that
was
more
than
a
hundred
years
before
the
slips
and
dock
had
long
been
abandoned
as
smollett
is
careful
to
point
out
in
his
manuscript
notes
now
in
the
british
museum
he
also
explains
with
superfluous
caution
that
the
duomo
of
pisa
is
not
entirely
gothic
once
arrived
in
the
capital
of
tuscany
after
admitting
that
florence
is
a
noble
city
our
traveller
is
anxious
to
avoid
the
hackneyed
ecstasies
and
threadbare
commonplaces
derived
in
those
days
from
vasari
through
keysler
and
other
german
commentators
whose
genius
smollett
is
inclined
to
discover
rather
in
the
back
than
in
the
brain
the
two
for
a
connoisseur
according
to
goldsmith
were
to
praise
perugino
and
to
say
that
such
and
such
a
work
would
have
been
much
better
had
the
painter
devoted
more
time
and
study
to
it
with
these
alternatives
at
hand
one
might
pass
with
credit
through
any
famous
continental
collection
smollett
aspired
to
more
independence
of
thought
and
opinion
though
we
perceive
at
every
turn
how
completely
the
protestant
prejudice
of
his
moment
and
milieu
had
obtained
dominion
over
him
to
his
perception
monks
do
not
chant
or
intone
they
bawl
and
bellow
their
litanies
flagellants
are
hired
peasants
who
pad
themselves

the
image
of

bejewelled
hooped
painted
patched
curled
and
frizzled
in
the
very
extremity
of
the
fashion
no
particular
attention
is
paid
by
the
mob
to
the
crucified

but
as
soon
as
his
appeared
on
the
shoulders
of

for
he

an
historian
eye
and
knows
the
symptoms
for
which
the

who
comes

is
likely
to
make
inquisition
smollett
observations
upon
the
state
of
florence

are
by
no

indeed
on

threshold
of

sweeping
administrative
reforms
instituted
by
peter
leopold
the
archduke
for
whom
smollett
relates
that
they
were
preparing
the
pitti
palace
at
the
time
of

stay
this
prince
governed
the
country
as
grand

to

and
left
a
name
in
history
as
the
leopold
few
more
active
exponents
of
paternal
reform
are
known
to
history
but
the
grand
duke
had
to
deal
with
a
people
such
as
smollett
describes
conservative
to
the
core
subservient
to
their
religious
directors
the
stupid
party
in
florence
proved
themselves
clever
enough
to
retard
the
process
of
enlightenment
by
methods
at
which
even
smollett
himself
might
have
stood
amazed
the
traveller
touches
an
interesting
source
of
biography
when
he
refers
to
the
englishman
called
acton
formerly
an
east
india
company
captain
now
commander
of
the
emperor
tuscan
navy
consisting
of
a
few
frigates
this
worthy
was
the
old
commodore
whom
gibbon
visited
in
retirement
at
leghorn
the
commodore
was
brother
of
friend
acton
who
was
settled
at
besancon
where
his
noted
son
afterwards
sir
john
acton
was
born
in
following
in
the
footsteps
of
his
uncle
the
commodore
who
became
a
catholic
smollett
tells
us
and
was
promoted
admiral
of
tuscany
john
acton
entered
the
tuscan
marine
in
sir
john
acton
subsequent
career
belongs
to
history
his
origin
made
him
an
expert
on
naval
affairs
and
in
he
obtained
some
credit
for
an
expedition
which
he
commanded
against
the
barbary
pirates
in
maria
carolina
of
naples
visited
her
brother
leopold
at
florence
and
was
impressed
by
acton
ugliness
and
reputation
for
exceptional
efficiency
her
favourite
minister
prince
caramanico
persuaded
the
grand
duke
leopold
to
permit
acton
to
exchange
into
the
neapolitan
service
and
reorganize
the
navy
of
the
southern
kingdom
this
actually
came
to
pass
and
moreover
acton
played
his
cards
so
well
that
he
soon
engrossed
the
ministries
of
war
and
finance
and
after
the
death
of
caracciolo
the
elder
also
that
of
foreign
affairs
sir
william
hamilton
had
a
high
opinion
of
the
general

to

took
a
strong
part
in
resistance
to

propaganda
caused
to
be
built
the
ships
which
assisted
nelson
in
and
proved
himself
one
of
the
most
capable
bureaucrats
of
the
time
but
the
french
proved
too
strong
and
napoleon
was
the
cause
of
his
disgrace
in
in
that
year
by
special
dispensation
from
the
pope
he
married
his
niece
and
retired
to
palermo
where
he
died
on
august
let
loose
in
the
uffizi
gallery
smollett
shocked
his
sensitive
contemporaries
by
his
freedom
from
those
sham
ecstasies
which
have
too
often
dogged
the
footsteps
of
the
virtuosi
like
scott
or
mark
twain
at
a
later
date
smollett
was
perfectly
ready
to
admire
anything
he
could
understand
but
he
expressly
disclaims
pretensions
to
the
nice
discernment
and
delicate
sensibility
of
the
connoisseur
he
would
never
have
asked
to
be
left
alone
with
the
venus
de
medicis
as
a
modern
is
related
to
have
asked
to
be
left
alone
with
the
venus
of
rokeby
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
state
of
mind
of
the
eminent
actor
who
thought
the
situation
demanded
that
he
should
be
positively
bereft
of
breath
at
first
sight
of
the
apollo
belvedere
and
panting
to
regain
it
convulsively
clutched
at
the
arm
of
his
companion
with
difficulty
articulating
i
breathe
smollett
refused
to
be
hypnotized
by
the
famous
venus
discovered
at
hadrian
villa
brought
from
tivoli
in
and
then
in
the
height
of
its
renown
the
form
he
admired
but
condemned
the
face
and
the
posture
personally
i
disagree
with
smollett
though
the
balance
of
cultivated
opinion
has
since
come
round
to
his
side
the
guilt
of
smollett
lay
in
criticizing
what
was
above
criticism
as
the
contents
of
the
tribuna
were
then
held
to
be
and
in
defence
of
this
point
of
view
it
may
at
least
be
said
that
the
uffizi
was
then
with
the
exception
of
the
vatican
the
only
gallery
of
importance
open
to
the
travelling
public
on
the
grand
tour
founded
by
cosimo
i
built
originally
by
george
vasari
and
greatly
enlarged
by
francis
i
who
succeeded
to
the
grand
duchy
in
the
gallery
owed
most
perhaps
to
the
cardinal
afterwards
ferdinand
i
who
constructed
the
tribuna
and
to
cardinal
leopold
an
omnivorous
collector
who
died
in
but
all
the
medici
princes
added
to
the
rarities
in
the
various
cabinets
drawing
largely
upon
the
villa
medici
at
rome
for
this
purpose
and
the
last
of
them
john
gaston
was
one
of
the
most
liberal
as
regards
the
freedom
of
access
which
he
allowed
to
his
accumulated
treasures
among
the
distinguished
antiquaries
who
acted
as
curators
and
cicerones
were
sebastiano
bianchi
antonio
cocchi
raymond
cocchi
joseph
bianchi
j
pelli
the
abbe
lanzi
and
zacchiroli
the
last
three
all
wrote
elaborate
descriptions
of
the
gallery
during
the
last
decades
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
was
unhappily
an
epidemic
of
dishonesty
among
the
custodians
of
gems
at
this
period
and
like
the
notorious
raspe
who
fled
from
cassel
in
and
turned
some
of
his
old
employers
to
ridicule
in
his
baron
munchausen
joseph
bianchi
was
convicted
first
of
robbing
his
cabinet
and
then
attempting
to
set
it
on
fire
for
which
exploit
the
learned
and
judicious
bianchi
as
smollett
called
him
in
his
first
edition
was
sent
to
prison
for
life
the
arrotino
which
smollett
so
greatly
admired
and
which
the
delusive
bianchi
declared
to
be
a
representation
of
the
augur
attus
naevius
is
now
described
as
a
scythian
whetting
his

marsyas
kinglake
has
an
amusingly
cynical
passage
on
the
impossibility
of
approaching
the
sacred
shrines
of
the
holy
land
in
a
fittingly
reverential
mood
exactly
the
same
difficulty
is
experienced
in
approaching
the
sacred
shrines
of
art
enthusiasm
about
great
artistic
productions
though
we
may
readily
understand
it
to
be
justifiable
is
by
no
means
so
easily
communicable
how
many
people
possessing
a
real
claim
to
culture
have
felt
themselves
puzzled
by
their
insensibility
before
some
great
masterpiece
conditions
may
be
easily
imagined
in
which
the
inducement
to
affect
an
ecstasy
becomes
so
strong
as
to
prove
overpowering
many
years
ago
at
florence
the
loiterers
in
the
tribuna
were
startled
by
the
sudden
rush
into
the
place
of
a
little
man
whose
literary
fame
gave
him
high
claims
to
intuitive
taste
he
placed
himself
with
high
clasped
hand
before
the
chief
attraction
in
that
room
of
treasures
there
he
murmured
is
the
venus
de
medicis
and
here
i
must
stay
for
ever
and
for
ever
he
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
each
more
deeply
and
solemnly
than
the
preceding
when
an
acquaintance
entered
and
the
enthusiast
making
a
hasty
inquiry
if
lady
had
arrived
left
the
room
not
to
return
again
that
morning
before
the
same
statue
another
distinguished
countryman
used
to
pass
an
hour
daily
his
acquaintance
respected
his
raptures
and
kept
aloof
but
a
young
lady
whose
attention
was
attracted
by
sounds
that
did
not
seem
expressive
of
admiration
ventured
to
approach
and
found
the
poet
sunk
in
profound
but
not
silent
slumber
from
such
absurdities
as
these
or
of
the
enthusiast
who
went
into
raptures
about
the
head
of
the
elgin
ilissos
which
is
unfortunately
a
headless
trunk
we
are
happily
spared
in
the
pages
of
smollett
in
him
complete
absence
of
gush
is
accompanied
by
an
independent
judgement
for
which
it
may
quite
safely
be
claimed
that
good
taste
is
in
the
ascendant
in
the
majority
of
cases
from
florence
smollett
set
out
in
october
for
siena
a
distance
of
miles
in
a
good
travelling
coach
he
slept
there
and
next
day
seven
and
a
half
miles
farther
on
at
boon
convento
hard
by
montepulciano
now
justly
celebrated
for
its
wine
he
had
the
amusing
adventure
with
the
hostler
which
gave
occasion
for
his
vivid
portrait
of
an
italian
uffiziale
and
also
to
that
irresistible
impulse
to
cane
the
insolent
hostler
from
the
ill
consequences
of
which
he
was
only
saved
by
the
underling
precipitate
flight
the
night
was
spent
at
radicofani
five
and
twenty
miles
farther
on
a
clever
postilion
diversified
the
route
to
viterbo
another
miles
the
party
was
now
within
sixteen
leagues
or
ten
hours
of
rome
the
road
from
radicofani
was
notoriously
bad
all
the
way
but
smollett
was
too
excited
or
too
impatient
to
pay
much
attention
to
it
you
may
guess
what
i
felt
at
first
sight
of
the
city
of
rome
when
you
arrive
at
rome
he
says
later
in
somewhat
more
accustomed
vein
you
receive
cards
from
all
your
country
folk
in
that
city
they
expect
to
have
the
visit
returned
next
day
when
they
give
orders
not
to
be
at
home
and
you
never
speak
to
one
another
in
the
sequel
this
is
a
refinement
in
hospitality
and
politeness
which
the
english
have
invented
by
the
strength
of
their
own
genius
without
any
assistance
either
from
france
italy
or
lapland
it
is
needless
to
recapitulate
smollett
views
of
rome
every
one
has
his
own
and
a
passing
traveller
annotations
are
just
about
as
nourishing
to
the
imagination
as
a
bibliographer
note
on
the
bible
smollett
speaks
in
the
main
judiciously
of
the
castle
of
angelo
the
piazza
and
the
interior
of
peter
the
pincian
the
forum
the
coliseum
the
baths
of
caracalla
and
the
other
famous
sights
of
successive
ages
on
roman
habits
and
pastimes
and
the
gullibility
of
the
english
cognoscente
he
speaks
with
more
spice
of
authority
upon
the
whole
he
is
decidedly
modest
about
his
virtuoso
vein
and
when
we
reflect
upon
the
way
in
which
standards
change
and
idols
are
shifted
from
one
pedestal
to
another
it
seems
a
pity
that
such
modesty
has
not
more
votaries
in
smollett
time
we
must
remember
that
hellenic
and
primitive
art
whether
antique
or
medieval
were
unknown
or
unappreciated
the
reigning
models
of
taste
in
ancient
sculpture
were
copies
of
originals
hellenistic
or
later
productions
hence
smollett
ecstasies
over
the
laocoon
the
niobe
and
the
dying
gladiator
greek
art
of
the
best
period
was
hardly
known
in
authentic
examples
antiques
so
fine
as
the
torso
of
hercules
were
rare
but
while
his
failures
show
the
danger
of
dogmatism
in
art
criticism
smollett
is
careful
to
disclaim
all
pretensions
to
the
nice
discernment
of
the
real
connoisseur
in
cases
where
good
sense
and
sincere
utterance
are
all
that
is
necessary
he
is
seldom
far
wrong
take
the
following
description
for
example
you
need
not
doubt
but
that
i
went
to
the
church
of
peter
in
montorio
to
view
the
celebrated
transfiguration
by
raphael
which
if
it
was
mine
i
would
cut
in
two
parts
the
three
figures
in
the
air
attract
the
eye
so
strongly
that
little
or
no
attention
is
paid
to
those
below
on
the
mountain
i
apprehend
that
the
nature
of
the
subject
does
not
admit
of
that
keeping
and
dependence
which
ought
to
be
maintained
in
the
disposition
of
the
lights
and
shadows
in
a
picture
the
groups
seem
to
be
entirely
independent
of
each
other
the
extraordinary
merit
of
this
piece
i
imagine
consists
not
only
in
the
expression
of
divinity
on
the
face
of
christ
but
also
in
the
surprising
lightness
of
the
figure
that
hovers
like
a
beautiful
exhalation
in
the
air
smollett
remarks
about
the
last
judgement
of
michael
angelo
that
it
confuses
the
eye
as
a
number
of
people
speaking
at
once
confounds
the
ear
and
that
while
single
figures
are
splendid
the
whole
together
resembles
a
mere
mob
without
subordination
keeping
or
repose
will
probably
be
by
a
large
proportion
of
the
sightseers
who
gaze
upon
it
yearly
but
his
description
of
the
transfiguration
displays
an
amount
of
taste
and
judgement
which
is
far
from
being
so
widely
distributed
for
purposes
of
reproduction
at
the
present
day
i
may
remind
the
reader
that
the
picture
is
ordinarily
cut
in
two
and
the
nether
portion
is
commonly
attributed
to
raphael
pupils
while
the
beautiful
exhalation
as
smollett
so
felicitously
terms
it
is
attributed
exclusively
to
the
master
when
at
the
zenith
of
his
powers
his
general
verdict
upon
michael
angelo
and
raphael
has
much
in
it
that
appeals
to
a
modern
taste
of
raphael
as
a
whole
he
concludes
that
the
master
possesses
the
serenity
of
virgil
but
lacks
the
fire
of
homer
and
before
leaving
this
same
letter
xxxiii
in
which
smollett
ventures
so
many
independent
critical
judgements
i
am
tempted
to
cite
yet
another
example
of
his
capacity
for
acute
yet
sympathetic
appreciation
in
the
palazzo
altieri
i
admired
a
picture
by
carlo
maratti
representing
a
saint
calling
down
lightning
from
heaven
to
destroy
blasphemers
it
was
the
figure
of
the
saint
i
admired
merely
as
a
portrait
the
execution
of
the
other
parts
was
tame
enough
perhaps
they
were
purposely
kept
down
in
order
to
preserve
the
importance
of
the
principal
figure
i
imagine
salvator
rosa
would
have
made
a
different
disposition
on
the
same
subject
that
amidst
the
darkness
of
a
tempest
he
would
have
illuminated
the
blasphemer
with
the
flash
of
lightning
by
which
he
was
destroyed
this
would
have
thrown
a
dismal
gleam
upon
his
countenance
distorted
by
the
horror
of
his
situation
as
well
as
by
the
effects
of
the
fire
and
rendered
the
whole
scene
dreadfully
picturesque
smollett
confuses
historical
and
aesthetic
grandeur
what
appeals
to
him
most
is
a
monument
of
a
whole
past
civilization
such
as
the
pont
du
gard
his
views
of
art
too
as
well
as
his
views
of
life
are
profoundly
influenced
by
his
early
training
as
a
surgeon
he
is
not
inclined
by
temperament
to
be
sanguine
his
gaze
is
often
fixed
like
that
of
a
doctor
upon
the
end
of
life
and
of
art
as
of
nature
he
takes
a
decidedly
pathological
view
yet
upon
the
whole
far
from
deriding
his
artistic
impressions
i
think
we
shall
be
inclined
rather
to
applaud
them
as
well
for
their
sanity
as
for
their
undoubted
sincerity
for
the
return
journey
to
florence
smollett
selected
the
alternative
route
by
narni
terni
spoleto
foligno
perugia
and
arezzo
and
by
his
own
account
no
traveller
ever
suffered
quite
so
much
as
he
did
from
dirt
vermin
poison
and
imposture
at
foligno
where
goethe
also
in
his
travels
a
score
of
years
or
so
later
had
an
amusing
adventure
smollett
was
put
into
a
room
recently
occupied
by
a
wild
beast
bestia
but
the
bestia
turned
out
on
investigation
to
be
no
more
or
no
less
than
an
english
heretic
the
food
was
so
filthy
that
it
might
have
turned
the
stomach
of
a
muleteer
their
coach
was
nearly
shattered
to
pieces
frozen
with
cold
and
nearly
devoured
by
rats
smollett
wept
in
silence
with
horror
and
fatigue
and
the
bugs
gave
the
doctor
a
if
smollett
anticipated
a
violent
death
from
exhaustion
and
chagrin
in
consequence
of
these
tortures
he
was
completely
disappointed
his
health
was
never
better
so
much
so
that
he
felt
constrained
in
fairness
to
drink
to
the
health
of
the
roman
banker
who
had
recommended
this
nefarious
route
see
the
doctor
remarks
at
the
end
of
letter
xxxv
by
florence
and
lerici
he
retraced
his
steps
to
nice
early
in
and
then
after
a
brief
jaunt
to
turin
where
he
met
sterne
and
back
by
the
col
di
tende
he
turned
his
face
definitely
homewards
the
journey
home
confirmed
his
liking
for
pisa
and
gives
an
opening
for
an
amusing
description
of
the
britisher
abroad
letter
xxxv
we
can
almost
overhear
thackeray
or
the
author
of
eothen
touching
this
same
topic
in
letter
xli
when
two
natives
of
any
other
country
chance
to
meet
abroad
they
run
into
each
other
embrace
like
old
friends
even
though
they
have
never
heard
of
one
another
till
that
moment
whereas
two
englishmen
in
the
same
situation
maintain
a
mutual
reserve
and
diffidence
and
keep
without
the
sphere
of
each
other
attraction
like
two
bodies
endowed
with
a
repulsive
power
letter
xxxvi
gives
opportunity
for
some
discerning
remarks
on
french
taxation
having
given
the
french
king
a
bit
of
excellent
advice
that
he
should
abolish
the
fermiers
generaux
smollett
proceeds
in
to
a
forecast
of
probabilities
which
is
deeply
significant
and
amazingly
shrewd
the
fragment
known
as
smollett
dying
prophecy
of
has
often
been
discredited
yet
the
substance
of
it
is
fairly
adumbrated
here
in
the
passage
beginning
there
are
undoubtedly
many
marks
of
relaxation
in
the
reins
of
french
government
written
fully
six
years
previously
after
a
pleasing
description
of
grasse
famous
for
its
pomatum
gloves
perfumes
and
toilette
boxes
lined
with
bergamot
the
homeward
traveller
crossed
the
french
frontier
at
antibes
and
in
letter
xxxix
at
marseille
he
compares
the
galley
slaves
of
france
with
those
of
savoy
at
bath
where
he
had
gone
to
set
up
a
practice
smollett
once
astonished
the
faculty
by
proving
in
a
pamphlet
that
the
therapeutic
properties
of
the
waters
had
been
prodigiously
exaggerated
so
now
in
the
south
of
france
he
did
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
solemnly
that
all
fermented
liquors
are
pernicious
to
the
human
constitution
elsewhere
he
comments
upon
the
immeasurable
appetite
of
the
french
for
bread
the
frenchman
will
recall
the
story
of
the
baron
whom
louis
xii
provided
with
a
luxurious
feast
which
the
lack
of
bread
made
uneatable
he
may
not
have
heard
a
story
told
me
in
liege
at
the
hotel
charlemagne
of
the
belgian
who
sought
to
conciliate
his
french
neighbour
by
remarking
je
vois
que
vous
etes
français
monsieur
parceque
vous
mangez
beaucoup
de
pain
and
the
frenchman
retort
je
vois
que
vous
etes
lye
monsieur
parceque
vous
mangez
beaucoup
de
tout
from
frejus
smollett
proceeds
to
toulon
repeating
the
old
epigram
that
the
king
of
france
is
greater
at
toulon
than
at
versailles
the
weather
is
so
pleasant
that
the
travellers
enjoy
a
continual
concert
of
nightingales
from
vienne
to
fontainebleau
the
douche
of
having
been
explained
smollett
and
his
party
proceeded
agreeably
to
avignon
where
by
one
of
the
strange
coincidences
of
travel
he
met
his
old
voiturier
joseph
so
embrowned
by
the
sun
that
he
might
have
passed
for
an
iroquois
in
spite
of
joseph
testimonial
the
plagues
of
posting
are
still
in
the
ascendant
and
smollett
is
once
more
generous
of
good
advice
above
all
he
adjures
us
when
travelling
never
to
omit
to
carry
a
hammer
and
nails
a
crowbar
an
iron
pin
or
two
a
large
knife
and
a
bladder
of
grease
why
not
a
lynch
pin
which
we
were
so
carefully
instructed
how
to
inquire
about
in
murray
conversation
for
travellers
history
of
his
troublous
travels
is
drawing
to
an
end
from
lyons
the
route
is
plain
through
macon
chalons
dijon
auxerre
sells
and
fontainebleau
the
whole
itinerary
almost
exactly
anticipates
that
of
talfourd
vacation
tour
one
hundred
and
ten
years
later
except
that
on
the
outward
journey
talfourd
sailed
down
the
rhone
smollett
old
mental
grievances
and
sores
have
been
shifted
and
to
some
extent
let
us
hope
dissipated
by
his
strenuous
journeyings
and
in
june
after
an
absence
of
two
years
he
is
once
more
enabled
to
write
you
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
i
feel
while
i
survey
the
white
cliffs
of
dover
at
this
distance
from
boulogne
not
that
i
am
at
all
affected
by
the
nescio
qua
dulcedine
natalis
soli
of
horace
that
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
fanaticism
founded
on
the
prejudices
of
education
which
induces
a
laplander
to
place
the
terrestrial
paradise
among
the
snows
of
norway
and
a
swiss
to
prefer
the
barren
mountains
of
soleure
to
the
fruitful
plains
of
lombardy
i
am
attached
to
my
country
because
it
is
the
land
of
liberty
cleanliness
and
convenience
but
i
love
it
still
more
tenderly
as
the
scene
of
all
my
interesting
connections
as
the
habitation
of
my
friends
for
whose
conversation
correspondence
and
esteem
i
wish
alone
to
live
for
the
time
being
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
hardships
smollett
had
to
undergo
on
his
italian
journey
by
sea
and
land
and
the
violent
passions
by
which
he
was
agitated
owing
to
the
conduct
of
refractory
postilions
and
extortionate
innkeepers
contributed
positively
to
brace
up
and
invigorate
his
constitution
he
spoke
of
himself
indeed
as
mended
by
not
unlike
tavernier
the
famous
traveller
said
to
have
been
radically
cured
of
the
gout
by
a
turkish
aga
in
egypt
who
gave
him
the
bastinado
because
he
would
not
look
at
the
head
of
the
bashaw
of
cairo
but
fizes
was
right
after
all
in
his
for
poor
smollett
cure
was
anything
but
a
radical
one
his
health
soon
collapsed
under
the
dreary
round
of
incessant
labour
at
chelsea
his
literary
faculty
was
still
maturing
and
developing
his
genius
was
mellowing
and
a
later
work
might
have
eclipsed
clinker
but
it
was
not
to
be
he
had
a
severe
relapse
in
the
winter
in
he
had
once
more
to
take
refuge
from
overwork
on
the
sunny
coast
he
had
done
so
much
to
popularize
among
his
countrymen
and
it
was
near
leghorn
that
he
died

dear
sir
you
laid
your
commands
upon
me
at
parting
to
communicate
from
time
to
time
the
observations
i
should
make
in
the
course
of
my
travels
and
it
was
an
injunction
i
received
with
pleasure
in
gratifying
your
curiosity
i
shall
find
some
amusement
to
beguile
the
tedious
hours
which
without
some
such
employment
would
be
rendered
insupportable
by
distemper
and
disquiet
you
knew
and
pitied
my
situation
traduced
by
malice
persecuted
by
faction
abandoned
by
false
patrons
and
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
a
domestic
calamity
which
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
fortune
to
repair
you
know
with
what
eagerness
i
fled
from
my
country
as
a
scene
of
illiberal
dispute
and
incredible
infatuation
where
a
few
worthless
incendiaries
had
by
dint
of
perfidious
calumnies
and
atrocious
abuse
kindled
up
a
flame
which
threatened
all
the
horrors
of
civil
dissension
i
packed
up
my
little
family
in
a
hired
coach
and
attended
by
my
trusty
servant
who
had
lived
with
me
a
dozen
of
years
and
now
refused
to
leave
me
took
the
road
to
dover
in
my
way
to
the
south
of
france
where
i
hoped
the
mildness
of
the
climate
would
prove
favourable
to
the
weak
state
of
my
lungs
you
advised
me
to
have
recourse
again
to
the
bath
waters
from
the
use
of
which
i
had
received
great
benefit
the
preceding
winter
but
i
had
many
inducements
to
leave
england
my
wife
earnestly
begged
i
would
convey
her
from
a
country
where
every
object
served
to
nourish
her
grief
i
was
in
hopes
that
a
succession
of
new
scenes
would
engage
her
attention
and
gradually
call
off
her
mind
from
a
series
of
painful
reflections
and
i
imagined
the
change
of
air
and
a
journey
of
near
a
thousand
miles
would
have
a
happy
effect
upon
my
own
constitution
but
as
the
summer
was
already
advanced
and
the
heat
too
excessive
for
travelling
in
warm
climates
i
proposed
staying
at
boulogne
till
the
beginning
of
autumn
and
in
the
mean
time
to
bathe
in
the
sea
with
a
view
to
strengthen
and
prepare
my
body
for
the
fatigues
of
such
a
long
journey
a
man
who
travels
with
a
family
of
five
persons
must
lay
his
account
with
a
number
of
mortifications
and
some
of
these
i
have
already
happily
overcome
though
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
road
to
dover
and
made
allowances
accordingly
i
could
not
help
being
chagrined
at
the
bad
accommodation
and
impudent
imposition
to
which
i
was
exposed
these
i
found
the
more
disagreeable
as
we
were
detained
a
day
extraordinary
on
the
road
in
consequence
of
my
wife
being
indisposed
i
need
not
tell
you
this
is
the
worst
road
in
england
with
respect
to
the
conveniences
of
travelling
and
must
certainly
impress
foreigners
with
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
the
nation
in
general
the
chambers
are
in
general
cold
and
comfortless
the
beds
paultry
the
cookery
execrable
the
wine
poison
the
attendance
bad
the
publicans
insolent
and
the
bills
extortion
there
is
not
a
drop
of
tolerable
malt
liquor
to
be
had
from
london
to
dover
every
landlord
and
every
waiter
harangued
upon
the
knavery
of
a
publican
in
canterbury
who
had
charged
the
french
ambassador
forty
pounds
for
a
supper
that
was
not
worth
forty
shillings
they
talked
much
of
honesty
and
conscience
but
when
they
produced
their
own
bills
they
appeared
to
be
all
of
the
same
family
and
complexion
if
it
was
a
reproach
upon
the
english
nation
that
an
innkeeper
should
pillage
strangers
at
that
rate
it
is
a
greater
scandal
that
the
same
fellow
should
be
able
to
keep
his
house
still
open
i
own
i
think
it
would
be
for
the
honour
of
the
kingdom
to
reform
the
abuses
of
this
road
and
in
particular
to
improve
the
avenue
to
london
by
the
way
of
which
is
a
most
disgraceful
entrance
to
such
an
opulent
city
a
foreigner
in
passing
through
this
beggarly
and
ruinous
suburb
conceives
such
an
idea
of
misery
and
meanness
as
all
the
wealth
and
magnificence
of
london
and
westminster
are
afterwards
unable
to
destroy
a
friend
of
mine
who
brought
a
parisian
from
dover
in
his
own
contrived
to
enter
southwark
after
it
was
dark
that
his
friend
might
not
perceive
the
nakedness
of
this
quarter
the
stranger
was
much
pleased
with
the
great
number
of
shops
full
of
merchandize
lighted
up
to
the
best
advantage
he
was
astonished
at
the
display
of
riches
in
and
cheapside
the
badness
of
the
pavement
made
him
find
the
streets
twice
as
long
as
they
were
they
alighted
in
upper
by
and
when
his
conductor
told
him
they
were
then
about
the
middle
of
london
the
frenchman
declared
with
marks
of
infinite
surprize
that
london
was
very
near
as
long
as
paris
on
my
arrival
at
dover
i
payed
off
my
coachman
who
went
away
with
a
heavy
heart
he
wanted
much
to
cross
the
sea
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
me
to
carry
the
coach
and
horses
to
the
other
side
if
i
had
been
resolved
to
set
out
immediately
for
the
south
perhaps
i
should
have
taken
his
advice
if
i
had
retained
him
at
the
rate
of
twenty
guineas
per
month
which
was
the
price
he
demanded
and
begun
my
journey
without
hesitation
i
should
travel
more
agreeably
than
i
can
expect
to
do
in
the
carriages
of
this
country
and
the
difference
of
the
expence
would
be
a
mere
trifle
i
would
advise
every
man
who
travels
through
france
to
bring
his
own
vehicle
along
with
him
or
at
least
to
purchase
one
at
calais
or
boulogne
where
berlins
and
chaises
may
be
generally
had
at
reasonable
rates
i
have
been
offered
a
very
good
berlin
for
thirty
guineas
but
before
i
make
the
purchase
i
must
be
better
informed
touching
the
different
methods
of
travelling
in
this
country
dover
is
commonly
termed
a
den
of
thieves
and
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
altogether
without
reason
it
has
acquired
this
appellation
the
people
are
said
to
live
by
piracy
in
time
of
war
and
by
smuggling
and
fleecing
strangers
in
time
of
peace
but
i
will
do
them
the
justice
to
say
they
make
no
distinction
between
foreigners
and
natives
without
all
doubt
a
man
can
not
be
much
worse
lodged
and
worse
treated
in
any
part
of
europe
nor
will
he
in
any
other
place
meet
with
more
flagrant
instances
of
fraud
imposition
and
brutality
one
would
imagine
they
had
formed
a
general
conspiracy
against
all
those
who
either
go
to
or
return
from
the
continent
about
five
years
ago
in
my
passage
from
flushing
to
dover
the
master
of
the
all
of
a
sudden
off
the
south
foreland
although
the
wind
was
as
favourable
as
it
could
blow
he
was
immediately
boarded
by
a
customhouse
boat
the
officer
of
which
appeared
to
be
his
friend
he
then
gave
the
passengers
to
understand
that
as
it
was
low
water
the
ship
could
not
go
into
the
harbour
but
that
the
boat
would
carry
them
ashore
with
their
baggage
the
officer
demanded
a
guinea
for
this
service
and
the
bargain
was
made
before
we
quitted
the
ship
we
were
obliged
to
gratify
the
for
his
attendance
and
to
give
to
the
sailors
the
boat
was
run
aground
on
the
open
beach
but
we
could
not
get
ashore
without
the
assistance
of
three
or
four
fellows
who
insisted
upon
being
paid
for
their
trouble
every
parcel
and
bundle
as
it
was
landed
was
snatched
up
by
a
separate
porter
one
ran
away
with
a
another
with
a
a
third
with
a
couple
of
shirts
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
and
two
were
employed
in
carrying
a
small
portmanteau
that
did
not
weigh
forty
pounds
all
our
things
were
hurried
to
the
to
be
searched
and
the
searcher
was
paid
for
disordering
our
cloaths
from
thence
they
were
removed
to
the
inn
where
the
porters
demanded
each
for
their
labour
it
was
in
vain
to
expostulate
they
surrounded
the
house
like
a
pack
of
hungry
bounds
and
raised
such
a
clamour
that
we
were
fain
to
comply
after
we
had
undergone
all
this
imposition
we
were
visited
by
the
master
of
the
packet
who
having
taken
our
fares
and
wished
us
joy
of
our
happy
arrival
in
england
expressed
his
hope
that
we
would
remember
the
poor
master
whose
wages
were
very
small
and
who
chiefly
depended
upon
the
generosity
of
the
passengers
i
own
i
was
shocked
at
his
meanness
and
could
not
help
telling
him
so
i
told
him
i
could
not
conceive
what
title
he
had
to
any
such
gratification
he
had
sixteen
passengers
who
paid
a
guinea
each
on
the
supposition
that
every
person
should
have
a
bed
but
there
were
no
more
than
eight
beds
in
the
cabin
and
each
of
these
was
occupied
before
i
came
on
board
so
that
if
we
had
been
detained
at
sea
a
whole
week
by
contrary
winds
and
bad
weather
one
half
of
the
passengers
must
have
slept
upon
the
boards
howsoever
their
health
might
have
suffered
from
this
want
of
accommodation
notwithstanding
this
check
he
was
so
very
abject
and
importunate
that
we
gave
him
a
crown
and
he
retired
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
arrived
at
dover
this
last
time
was
to
send
for
the
master
of
a
and
agree
with
him
to
carry
us
to
boulogne
at
once
by
which
means
i
saved
the
expence
of
travelling
by
land
from
calais
to
this
last
place
a
journey
of
miles
the
hire
of
a
vessel
from
dover
to
boulogne
is
precisely
the
same
as
from
dover
to
calais
five
guineas
but
this
skipper
demanded
eight
and
as
i
did
not
know
the
fare
i
agreed
to
give
him
six
we
embarked
between
six
and
seven
in
the
evening
and
found
ourselves
in
a
most
wretched
hovel
on
board
what
is
called
a
folkstone
cutter
the
cabin
was
so
small
that
a
dog
could
hardly
turn
in
it
and
the
beds
put
me
in
mind
of
the
holes
described
in
some
catacombs
in
which
the
bodies
of
the
dead
were
deposited
being
thrust
in
with
the
feet
foremost
there
was
no
getting
into
them
but
and
indeed
they
seemed
so
dirty
that
nothing
but
extreme
necessity
could
have
obliged
me
to
use
them
we
sat
up
all
night
in
a
most
uncomfortable
situation
tossed
about
by
the
sea
cold
arid
cramped
and
weary
and
languishing
for
want
of
sleep
at
three
in
the
morning
the
master
came
down
and
told
us
we
were
just
off
the
harbour
of
boulogne
but
the
wind
blowing
off
shore
he
could
not
possibly
enter
and
therefore
advised
us
to
go
ashore
in
the
boat
i
went
upon
deck
to
view
the
coast
when
he
pointed
to
the
place
where
he
said
boulogne
stood
declaring
at
the
same
time
we
were
within
a
short
mile
of
the
harbour
mouth
the
morning
was
cold
and
raw
and
i
knew
myself
extremely
subject
to
catch
cold
nevertheless
we
were
all
so
impatient
to
be
ashore
that
i
resolved
to
take
his
advice
the
boat
was
already
hoisted
out
and
we
went
on
board
of
it
after
i
had
paid
the
captain
and
gratified
his
crew
we
had
scarce
parted
from
the
ship
when
we
perceived
a
boat
coming
towards
us
from
the
shore
and
the
master
gave
us
to
understand
it
was
coming
to
carry
us
into
the
harbour
when
i
objected
to
the
trouble
of
shifting
from
one
boat
to
another
in
the
open
sea
which
by
the
bye
was
a
little
rough
he
said
it
was
a
privilege
which
the
watermen
of
boulogne
had
to
carry
all
passengers
ashore
and
that
this
privilege
he
durst
not
venture
to
infringe
this
was
no
time
nor
place
to
remonstrate
the
french
boat
came
alongside
half
filled
with
water
and
we
were
handed
from
the
one
to
the
other
we
were
then
obliged
to
lie
upon
our
oars
till
the
captain
boat
went
on
board
and
returned
from
the
ship
with
a
packet
of
letters
we
were
afterwards
rowed
a
long
league
in
a
rough
sea
against
wind
and
tide
before
we
reached
the
harbour
where
we
landed
benumbed
with
cold
and
the
women
excessively
sick
from
our
we
were
obliged
to
walk
very
near
a
mile
to
the
inn
where
we
purposed
to
lodge
attended
by
six
or
seven
men
and
women
carrying
our
baggage
this
boat
cost
me
a
guinea
besides
paying
exorbitantly
the
people
who
carried
our
things
so
that
the
inhabitants
of
dover
and
of
boulogne
seem
to
be
of
the
same
kidney
and
indeed
they
understand
one
another
perfectly
well
it
was
our
honest
captain
who
made
the
signal
for
the
before
i
went
upon
deck
by
which
means
he
not
only
gratified
his
friends
the
watermen
of
boulogne
but
also
saved
about
fifteen
shillings
portage
which
he
must
have
paid
had
he
gone
into
the
harbour
and
thus
he
found
himself
at
liberty
to
return
to
dover
which
he
reached
in
four
hours
i
mention
these
circumstances
as
a
warning
to
other
passengers
when
a
man
hires
a
from
dover
to
calais
or
boulogne
let
him
remember
that
the
stated
price
is
five
guineas
and
let
him
insist
upon
being
carried
into
the
harbour
in
the
ship
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
the
representations
of
the
master
who
is
generally
a
little
dirty
knave
when
he
tells
you
it
is
low
water
or
the
wind
is
in
your
teeth
you
may
say
you
will
stay
on
board
till
it
is
high
water
or
till
the
wind
comes
favourable
if
he
sees
you
are
resolute
he
will
find
means
to
bring
his
ship
into
the
harbour
or
at
least
to
convince
you
without
a
possibility
of
your
being
deceived
that
it
is
not
in
his
power
after
all
the
fellow
himself
was
a
loser
by
his
finesse
if
he
had
gone
into
the
harbour
he
would
have
had
another
fare
immediately
back
to
dover
for
there
was
a
scotch
gentleman
at
the
inn
waiting
for
such
an
opportunity
knowing
my
own
weak
constitution
i
took
it
for
granted
this
adventure
would
cost
me
a
fit
of
illness
and
what
added
to
my
chagrin
when
we
arrived
at
the
inn
all
the
beds
were
occupied
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
sit
in
a
cold
kitchen
above
two
hours
until
some
of
the
lodgers
should
get
up
this
was
such
a
bad
specimen
of
french
accommodation
that
my
wife
could
not
help
regretting
even
the
inns
of
rochester
sittingbourn
and
canterbury
bad
as
they
are
they
certainly
have
the
advantage
when
compared
with
the
execrable
auberges
of
this
country
where
one
finds
nothing
but
dirt
and
imposition
one
would
imagine
the
french
were
still
at
war
with
the
english
for
they
pillage
them
without
mercy
among
the
strangers
at
this
inn
where
we
lodged
there
was
a
gentleman
of
the
faculty
just
returned
from
italy
understanding
that
i
intended
to
winter
in
the
south
of
france
on
account
of
a
pulmonic
disorder
he
strongly
recommended
the
climate
of
nice
in
provence
which
indeed
i
had
often
heard
extolled
and
i
am
almost
resolved
to
go
thither
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
air
but
also
for
its
situation
on
the
mediterranean
where
i
can
have
the
benefit
of
bathing
and
from
whence
there
is
a
short
cut
by
sea
to
italy
should
i
find
it
necessary
to
try
the
air
of
naples
after
having
been
ill
accommodated
three
days
at
our
inn
we
have
at
last
found
commodious
lodgings
by
means
of
a
very
agreeable
french
lady
to
whom
we
were
recommended
by
her
husband
who
is
my
countryman
and
at
present
resident
in
london
for
three
guineas
a
month
we
have
the
greatest
part
of
a
house
tolerably
furnished
four
on
the
first
floor
a
large
parlour
below
a
kitchen
and
the
use
of
a
cellar
these
i
own
are
frivolous
incidents
scarce
worth
committing
to
paper
but
they
may
serve
to
introduce
observations
of
more
consequence
and
in
the
mean
time
i
know
nothing
will
be
indifferent
to
you
that
concerns
your
humble
servant
letter
ii
boulogne
sur
mer
july
dear
sir
the
officers
at
boulogne
though
as
alert
are
rather
more
civil
than
those
on
your
side
of
the
water
i
brought
no
plate
along
with
me
but
a
dozen
and
a
half
of
spoons
and
a
dozen
teaspoons
the
first
being
found
in
one
of
our
portmanteaus
when
they
were
examined
at
the
bureau
cost
me
seventeen
livres
entree
the
others
being
luckily
in
my
servant
pocket
escaped
duty
free
all
wrought
silver
imported
into
france
pays
at
the
rate
of
so
much
per
mark
therefore
those
who
have
any
quantity
of
plate
will
do
well
to
leave
it
behind
them
unless
they
can
confide
in
the
dexterity
of
the
shipmasters
some
of
whom
will
undertake
to
land
it
without
the
ceremony
of
examination
the
ordonnances
of
france
are
so
unfavourable
to
strangers
that
they
oblige
them
to
pay
at
the
rate
of
five
per
cent
for
all
the
bed
and
table
linen
which
they
bring
into
the
kingdom
even
though
it
has
been
used
when
my
trunks
arrived
in
a
ship
from
the
river
thames
i
underwent
this
ordeal
but
what
gives
me
more
vexation
my
books
have
been
stopped
at
the
bureau
and
will
be
sent
to
amiens
at
my
expence
to
be
examined
by
the
chambre
syndicale
lest
they
should
contain
something
prejudicial
to
the
state
or
to
the
religion
of
the
country
this
is
a
species
of
oppression
which
one
would
not
expect
to
meet
with
in
france
which
piques
itself
on
its
politeness
and
hospitality
but
the
truth
is
i
know
no
country
in
which
strangers
are
worse
treated
with
respect
to
their
essential
concerns
if
a
foreigner
dies
in
france
the
king
seizes
all
his
effects
even
though
his
heir
should
be
upon
the
spot
and
this
tyranny
is
called
the
droit
founded
at
first
upon
the
supposition
that
all
the
estate
of
foreigners
residing
in
france
was
acquired
in
that
kingdom
and
that
therefore
it
would
be
unjust
to
convey
it
to
another
country
if
an
english
protestant
goes
to
france
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
attended
by
his
wife
or
his
son
or
both
and
dies
with
effects
in
the
house
to
the
amount
of
a
thousand
guineas
the
king
seizes
the
whole
the
family
is
left
destitute
and
the
body
of
the
deceased
is
denied
christian
burial
the
swiss
by
capitulation
are
exempted
from
this
despotism
and
so
are
the
scots
in
consequence
of
an
ancient
alliance
between
the
two
nations
the
same
droit
is
exacted
by
some
of
the
princes
in
germany
but
it
is
a
great
discouragement
to
commerce
and
prejudices
every
country
where
it
is
exercised
to
ten
times
the
value
of
what
it
brings
into
the
coffers
of
the
sovereign
i
am
exceedingly
mortified
at
the
detention
of
my
books
which
not
only
deprives
me
of
an
amusement
which
i
can
very
ill
dispense
with
but
in
all
probability
will
expose
me
to
sundry
other
inconveniencies
i
must
be
at
the
expence
of
sending
them
sixty
miles
to
be
examined
and
run
the
risque
of
their
being
condemned
and
in
the
mean
time
i
may
lose
the
opportunity
of
sending
them
with
my
heavy
baggage
by
sea
to
bourdeaux
to
be
sent
up
the
garonne
to
tholouse
and
from
thence
transmitted
through
the
canal
of
languedoc
to
cette
which
is
a
on
the
mediterranean
about
three
or
four
leagues
from
montpelier
for
the
recovery
of
my
books
i
had
recourse
to
the
advice
of
my
landlord
mons
b
he
is
a
handsome
young
fellow
about
years
of
age
and
keeps
house
with
two
maiden
sisters
who
are
professed
devotees
the
brother
is
a
little
libertine
good
natured
and
obliging
but
a
true
frenchman
in
vanity
which
is
undoubtedly
the
ruling
passion
of
this
volatile
people
he
has
an
inconsiderable
place
under
the
government
in
consequence
of
which
he
is
permitted
to
wear
a
sword
a
privilege
which
he
does
not
fail
to
use
he
is
likewise
receiver
of
the
tythes
of
the
clergy
in
this
district
an
office
that
gives
him
a
command
of
money
and
he
moreover
deals
in
the
wine
trade
when
i
came
to
his
house
he
made
a
parade
of
all
these
advantages
he
displayed
his
bags
of
money
and
some
old
gold
which
his
father
had
left
him
he
described
his
chateau
in
the
country
dropped
hints
of
the
fortunes
that
were
settled
upon
mademoiselles
his
sisters
boasted
of
his
connexions
at
court
and
assured
me
it
was
not
for
my
money
that
he
let
his
lodgings
but
altogether
with
a
view
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
my
company
the
truth
when
stript
of
all
embellishments
is
this
the
sieur
b
is
the
son
of
an
honest
bourgeois
lately
dead
who
left
him
the
house
with
some
stock
in
trade
a
little
money
and
a
paltry
farm
his
sisters
have
about
three
thousand
livres
not
quite
l
apiece
the
brother
places
are
worth
about
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
his
connexions
at
court
are
confined
to
a
commis
or
clerk
in
the
secretary
office
with
whom
he
corresponds
by
virtue
of
his
employment
my
landlord
piques
himself
upon
his
gallantry
and
success
with
the
he
keeps
a
fille
de
joye
and
makes
no
secret
of
his
amours
he
told
miss
c
the
other
day
in
broken
english
that
in
the
course
of
the
last
year
he
had
made
six
bastards
he
owned
at
the
same
time
he
had
sent
them
all
to
the
hospital
but
now
his
father
is
dead
he
would
himself
take
care
of
his
future
productions
this
however
was
no
better
than
a
gasconade
yesterday
the
house
was
in
a
hot
alarm
on
account
of
a
new
windfall
of
this
kind
the
sisters
were
in
tears
the
brother
was
visited
by
the
cure
of
the
parish
the
lady
in
the
straw
a
sempstress
sent
him
the
bantling
in
a
basket
and
he
transmitted
it
by
the
carriers
to
the
enfans
trouves
at
paris
but
to
return
from
this
digression
b
advised
me
to
send
a
requete
or
petition
to
the
chancellor
of
france
that
i
might
obtain
an
order
to
have
my
books
examined
on
the
spot
by
the
president
of
boulogne
or
the
procureur
du
roy
or
the
of
the
intendance
he
recommended
an
advocat
of
his
acquaintance
to
draw
up
the
memoire
and
introduced
him
accordingly
telling
me
at
the
same
time
in
private
that
if
he
was
not
a
drunkard
he
would
be
at
the
head
of
his
profession
he
had
indeed
all
the
outward
signs
of
a
sot
a
sleepy
eye
a
rubicund
face
and
carbuncled
nose
he
seemed
to
be
a
little
out
at
elbows
had
marvellous
foul
linen
and
his
breeches
were
not
very
sound
but
he
assumed
an
air
of
importance
was
very
courteous
and
very
solemn
i
asked
him
if
he
did
not
sometimes
divert
himself
with
the
muse
he
smiled
and
promised
in
a
whisper
to
shew
me
some
chansonettes
de
sa
facon
meanwhile
he
composed
the
requete
in
my
name
which
was
very
pompous
very
tedious
and
very
abject
such
a
stile
might
perhaps
be
necessary
in
a
native
of
france
but
i
did
not
think
it
was
at
all
suitable
to
a
subject
of
i
thanked
him
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
as
he
would
receive
no
other
gratification
but
when
my
landlord
proposed
to
send
the
memoire
to
his
correspondent
at
paris
to
be
delivered
to
the
chancellor
i
told
him
i
had
changed
my
mind
and
would
apply
to
the
english
ambassador
i
have
accordingly
taken
the
liberty
to
address
myself
to
the
earl
of
h
and
at
the
same
time
i
have
presumed
to
write
to
the
duchess
of
d
who
is
now
at
paris
to
entreat
her
grace
advice
and
interposition
what
effect
these
applications
may
have
i
know
not
but
the
sieur
b
shakes
his
head
and
has
told
my
servant
in
confidence
that
i
am
mistaken
if
i
think
the
english
ambassador
is
as
great
a
man
at
paris
as
the
chancellor
of
france
i
ought
to
make
an
apology
for
troubling
you
with
such
an
unentertaining
detail
and
consider
that
the
detention
of
my
books
must
be
a
matter
of
very
little
consequence
to
any
body
but
to
your
affectionate
humble
servant
letter
iii
boulogne
august
sir
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
enquiries
after
my
health
which
has
been
lately
in
a
very
declining
condition
in
consequence
of
a
cold
caught
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
in
france
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
cough
attended
with
a
fever
and
stitches
in
my
breast
which
tormented
me
all
night
long
without
ceasing
at
the
same
time
i
had
a
great
discharge
by
expectoration
and
such
a
dejection
of
spirits
as
i
never
felt
before
in
this
situation
i
took
a
step
which
may
appear
to
have
been
desperate
i
knew
there
was
no
imposthume
in
my
lungs
and
i
supposed
the
stitches
were
spasmodical
i
was
sensible
that
all
my
complaints
were
originally
derived
from
relaxation
i
therefore
hired
a
chaise
and
going
to
the
beach
about
a
league
from
the
town
plunged
into
the
sea
without
hesitation
by
this
desperate
remedy
i
got
a
fresh
cold
in
my
head
but
my
stitches
and
fever
vanished
the
very
first
day
and
by
a
daily
repetition
of
the
bath
i
have
diminished
my
cough
strengthened
my
body
and
recovered
my
spirits
i
believe
i
should
have
tried
the
same
experiment
even
if
there
had
been
an
abscess
in
my
lungs
though
such
practice
would
have
been
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
medicine
but
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
implicitly
believe
in
all
the
dogmata
of
physic
i
saw
one
of
the
guides
at
bath
the
stoutest
fellow
among
them
who
recovered
from
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
by
going
into
the
king
bath
contrary
to
the
express
injunction
of
his
doctor
he
said
if
he
must
die
the
sooner
the
better
as
he
had
nothing
left
for
his
subsistence
instead
of
immediate
death
he
found
instant
case
and
continued
mending
every
day
till
his
health
was
entirely
i
myself
drank
the
waters
of
bath
and
bathed
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
some
physicians
there
settled
and
found
myself
better
every
day
notwithstanding
their
unfavourable
prognostic
if
i
had
been
of
the
rigid
fibre
full
of
blood
subject
to
inflammation
i
should
have
followed
a
different
course
our
acquaintance
doctor
c
while
he
actually
spit
up
matter
and
rode
out
every
day
for
his
life
led
his
horse
to
water
at
the
pond
in
one
cold
frosty
morning
and
the
beast
which
happened
to
be
of
a
hot
constitution
plunged
himself
and
his
master
over
head
and
ears
in
the
water
the
poor
doctor
hastened
home
half
dead
with
fear
and
was
put
to
bed
in
the
apprehension
of
a
new
imposthume
instead
of
which
he
found
himself
exceedingly
recruited
in
his
spirits
and
his
appetite
much
mended
i
advised
him
to
take
the
hint
and
go
into
the
cold
bath
every
morning
but
he
did
not
chuse
to
run
any
risque
how
cold
water
comes
to
be
such
a
bugbear
i
know
not
if
i
am
not
mistaken
hippocrates
recommends
immersion
in
cold
water
for
the
gout
and
celsus
expressly
says
in
omni
tussi
utilis
est
natatio
in
every
cough
swimming
is
of
service
i
have
conversed
with
a
physician
of
this
place
a
sensible
man
who
assured
me
he
was
reduced
to
meer
skin
and
bone
by
a
cough
and
hectic
fever
when
he
ordered
a
bath
to
be
made
in
his
own
house
and
dipped
himself
in
cold
water
every
morning
he
at
the
same
time
left
off
drinking
and
swallowing
any
liquid
that
was
warm
he
is
now
strong
and
lusty
and
even
in
winter
has
no
other
cover
than
a
single
sheet
his
notions
about
the
warm
drink
were
a
little
whimsical
he
imagined
it
relaxed
the
tone
of
the
stomach
and
this
would
undoubtedly
be
the
case
if
it
was
drank
in
large
quantities
warmer
than
the
natural
temperature
of
the
blood
he
alledged
the
example
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
ladrone
islands
who
never
taste
any
thing
that
is
not
cold
and
are
remarkably
healthy
but
to
balance
this
argument
i
mentioned
the
chinese
who
scarce
drink
any
thing
but
warm
tea
and
the
laplanders
who
drink
nothing
but
warm
water
yet
the
people
of
both
these
nations
are
remarkably
strong
healthy
and
you
desire
to
know
the
fate
of
my
books
my
lord
h
d
is
not
yet
come
to
france
but
my
letter
was
transmitted
to
him
from
paris
and
his
lordship
with
that
generous
humanity
which
is
peculiar
to
his
character
has
done
me
the
honour
to
assure
me
under
his
own
hand
that
he
has
directed
n
lle
our
resident
at
paris
to
apply
for
an
order
that
my
books
may
be
restored
i
have
met
with
another
piece
of
good
fortune
in
being
introduced
to
general
paterson
and
his
lady
in
their
way
to
england
from
nice
where
the
general
has
been
many
years
commandant
for
the
king
of
sardinia
you
must
have
heard
of
this
gentleman
who
has
not
only
eminently
distinguished
himself
by
his
courage
and
conduct
as
an
officer
but
also
by
his
probity
and
humanity
in
the
exercise
of
his
office
and
by
his
remarkable
hospitality
to
all
strangers
especially
the
subjects
of
whose
occasions
called
them
to
the
place
where
he
commanded
being
pretty
far
advanced
in
years
he
begged
leave
to
resign
that
he
might
spend
the
evening
of
his
days
in
his
own
country
and
his
sardinian
majesty
granted
his
request
with
regret
after
having
honoured
him
with
very
particular
marks
of
approbation
and
esteem
the
general
talks
so
favourably
of
the
climate
of
nice
with
respect
to
disorders
of
the
breast
that
i
am
now
determined
to
go
thither
it
would
have
been
happy
for
me
had
he
continued
in
his
government
i
think
myself
still
very
fortunate
in
having
obtained
of
him
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
english
consul
at
nice
together
with
directions
how
to
travel
through
the
south
of
france
i
propose
to
begin
my
journey
some
time
next
month
when
the
weather
will
be
temperate
to
the
southward
and
in
the
wine
countries
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
vintage
which
is
always
a
season
of
festivity
among
all
ranks
of
people
you
have
been
very
much
by
the
person
who
compared
boulogne
to
wapping
he
did
a
manifest
injustice
to
this
place
which
is
a
large
agreeable
town
with
broad
open
streets
excellently
paved
and
the
houses
are
of
stone
well
built
and
commodious
the
number
of
inhabitants
may
amount
to
sixteen
thousand
you
know
this
was
generally
supposed
to
be
the
portus
itius
and
gessoriacum
of
the
antients
though
it
is
now
believed
that
the
portus
itius
from
whence
caesar
sailed
to
britain
is
a
place
called
whitsand
about
half
way
between
this
place
and
calais
boulogne
is
the
capital
of
the
boulonnois
a
district
extending
about
twelve
leagues
ruled
by
a
governor
independent
of
the
governor
of
picardy
of
which
province
however
this
country
forms
a
part
the
present
governor
is
the
duc
the
town
of
boulogne
is
the
see
of
a
bishop
suffragan
of
rheims
whose
revenue
amounts
to
about
thousand
livres
or
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
it
is
also
the
seat
of
a
seneschal
court
from
whence
an
appeal
lies
to
the
parliament
of
paris
and
thither
all
condemned
criminals
are
sent
to
have
their
sentence
confirmed
or
reversed
here
is
likewise
a
bailiwick
and
a
court
of
admiralty
the
military
jurisdiction
of
the
city
belongs
to
a
commandant
appointed
by
the
king
a
sort
of
sinecure
bestowed
upon
some
old
officer
his
appointments
are
very
inconsiderable
he
resides
in
the
upper
town
and
his
garrison
at
present
consists
of
a
few
hundreds
of
invalids
boulogne
is
divided
into
the
upper
and
lower
towns
the
former
is
a
kind
of
citadel
about
a
short
mile
in
circumference
situated
on
a
rising
ground
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
and
rampart
planted
with
rows
of
trees
which
form
a
delightful
walk
it
commands
a
fine
view
of
the
country
and
lower
town
and
in
clear
weather
the
coast
of
england
from
dover
to
folkstone
appears
so
plain
that
one
would
imagine
it
was
within
four
or
five
leagues
of
the
french
shore
the
upper
town
was
formerly
fortified
with
outworks
which
are
now
in
ruins
here
is
a
square
a
the
cathedral
and
two
or
three
convents
of
nuns
in
one
of
which
there
are
several
english
girls
sent
hither
for
their
education
the
smallness
of
the
expence
encourages
parents
to
send
their
children
abroad
to
these
seminaries
where
they
learn
scarce
any
thing
that
is
useful
but
the
french
language
but
they
never
fail
to
imbibe
prejudices
against
the
protestant
religion
and
generally
return
enthusiastic
converts
to
the
religion
of
rome
this
conversion
always
generates
a
contempt
for
and
often
an
aversion
to
their
own
country
indeed
it
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
that
people
of
weak
minds
addicted
to
superstition
should
either
love
or
esteem
those
whom
they
are
taught
to
consider
as
reprobated
heretics
ten
pounds
a
year
is
the
usual
pension
in
these
convents
but
i
have
been
informed
by
a
french
lady
who
had
her
education
in
one
of
them
that
nothing
can
be
more
wretched
than
their
entertainment
the
civil
magistracy
of
boulogne
consists
of
a
mayor
and
echevins
and
this
is
the
case
in
almost
all
the
towns
of
france
the
lower
town
is
continued
from
the
gate
of
the
upper
town
down
the
slope
of
a
hill
as
far
as
the
harbour
stretching
on
both
sides
to
a
large
extent
and
is
much
more
considerable
than
the
upper
with
respect
to
the
beauty
of
the
streets
the
convenience
of
the
houses
and
the
number
and
wealth
of
the
inhabitants
these
however
are
all
merchants
or
bourgeoise
for
the
noblesse
or
gentry
live
all
together
in
the
upper
town
and
never
mix
with
the
others
the
harbour
of
boulogne
is
at
the
mouth
of
the
small
river
or
rather
rivulet
liane
which
is
so
shallow
that
the
children
wade
through
it
at
low
water
as
the
tide
makes
the
sea
flows
in
and
forms
a
pretty
extensive
harbour
which
however
admits
nothing
but
small
vessels
it
is
contracted
at
the
mouth
by
two
stone
jetties
or
piers
which
seem
to
have
been
constructed
by
some
engineer
very
little
acquainted
with
this
branch
of
his
profession
for
they
are
carried
out
in
such
a
manner
as
to
collect
a
bank
of
sand
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
the
road
is
very
open
and
unsafe
and
the
surf
very
high
when
the
wind
blows
from
the
sea
there
is
no
fortification
near
the
harbour
except
a
paltry
fort
mounting
about
twenty
guns
built
in
the
last
war
by
the
prince
de
cruy
upon
a
rock
about
a
league
to
the
eastward
of
boulogne
it
appears
to
be
situated
in
such
a
manner
that
it
can
neither
offend
nor
be
offended
if
the
depth
of
water
would
admit
a
forty
or
fifty
gun
ship
to
lie
within
of
it
i
apprehend
it
might
be
silenced
in
half
an
hour
but
in
all
probability
there
will
be
no
vestiges
of
it
at
the
next
rupture
between
the
two
crowns
it
is
surrounded
every
day
by
the
sea
at
high
water
and
when
it
blows
a
fresh
gale
towards
the
shore
the
waves
break
over
the
top
of
it
to
the
terror
and
astonishment
of
the
garrison
who
have
been
often
heard
crying
piteously
for
assistance
i
am
persuaded
that
it
will
one
day
disappear
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
neighbourhood
of
this
fort
which
is
a
smooth
sandy
beach
i
have
chosen
for
my
bathing
place
the
road
to
it
is
agreeable
and
romantic
lying
through
pleasant
cornfields
skirted
by
open
downs
where
there
is
a
rabbit
warren
and
great
plenty
of
the
birds
so
much
admired
at
tunbridge
under
the
name
of
by
the
bye
this
is
a
pleasant
corruption
of
the
translation
of
their
french
name
taken
from
their
colour
for
they
are
actually
white
towards
the
tail
upon
the
top
of
a
high
rock
which
overlooks
the
harbour
are
the
remains
of
an
old
fortification
which
is
indiscriminately
called
tour
and
julius
caesar
fort
the
original
tower
was
a
built
by
claudius
caesar
denominated
turris
ardens
from
the
fire
burned
in
it
and
this
the
french
have
corrupted
into
tour
but
no
vestiges
of
this
roman
work
remain
what
we
now
see
are
the
ruins
of
a
castle
built
by
charlemagne
i
know
of
no
other
antiquity
at
boulogne
except
an
old
vault
in
the
upper
town
now
used
as
a
magazine
which
is
said
to
be
part
of
an
antient
temple
dedicated
to
isis
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
opposite
to
the
lower
town
there
is
a
house
built
at
a
considerable
expence
by
a
general
officer
who
lost
his
life
in
the
late
war
never
was
situation
more
inconvenient
unpleasant
and
unhealthy
it
stands
on
the
edge
of
an
ugly
morass
formed
by
the
stagnant
water
left
by
the
tide
in
its
retreat
the
very
walks
of
the
garden
are
so
moist
that
in
the
driest
weather
no
person
can
make
a
tour
of
it
without
danger
of
the
rheumatism
besides
the
house
is
altogether
inaccessible
except
at
low
water
and
even
then
the
carriage
must
cross
the
harbour
the
wheels
up
to
the
in
mud
nay
the
tide
rushes
in
so
fast
that
unless
you
seize
the
time
to
a
minute
you
will
be
in
danger
of
perishing
the
apartments
of
this
house
are
elegantly
fitted
up
but
very
small
and
the
garden
notwithstanding
its
unfavourable
situation
affords
a
great
quantity
of
good
fruit
the
ooze
impregnated
with
sea
salt
produces
on
this
side
of
the
harbour
an
incredible
quantity
of
the
finest
samphire
i
ever
saw
the
french
call
it
and
i
suspect
its
english
name
is
a
corruption
of
it
is
generally
found
on
the
faces
of
bare
rocks
that
overhang
the
sea
by
the
spray
of
which
it
is
nourished
as
it
grew
upon
a
naked
rock
without
any
appearance
of
soil
it
might
be
naturally
enough
called
sang
du
pierre
or
sangpierre
blood
of
the
rock
and
hence
the
name
samphire
on
the
same
side
of
the
harbour
there
is
another
new
house
neatly
built
belonging
to
a
gentleman
who
has
obtained
a
grant
from
the
king
of
some
ground
which
was
always
overflowed
at
high
water
he
has
raised
dykes
at
a
considerable
expence
to
exclude
the
tide
and
if
he
can
bring
his
project
to
bear
he
will
not
only
gain
a
good
estate
for
himself
but
also
improve
the
harbour
by
increasing
the
depth
at
in
the
lower
town
of
boulogne
there
are
several
religious
houses
particularly
a
seminary
a
convent
of
cordeliers
and
another
of
capuchins
this
last
having
fallen
to
decay
was
some
years
ago
repaired
chiefly
by
the
charity
of
british
travellers
collected
by
father
graeme
a
native
of
who
had
been
an
officer
in
the
army
of
king
james
ii
and
is
said
to
have
turned
monk
of
this
mendicant
order
by
way
of
voluntary
penance
for
having
killed
his
friend
in
a
duel
be
that
as
it
may
he
was
a
sensible
man
of
a
very
exemplary
life
and
conversation
and
his
memory
is
much
revered
in
this
place
being
superior
of
the
convent
he
caused
the
british
arms
to
be
put
up
in
the
church
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
for
the
benefactions
received
from
our
nation
i
often
walk
in
the
garden
of
the
convent
the
walls
of
which
are
washed
by
the
sea
at
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
is
a
little
private
grove
separated
from
it
by
a
high
wall
with
a
door
of
communication
and
hither
the
capuchins
retire
when
they
are
disposed
for
contemplation
about
two
years
ago
this
place
was
said
to
be
converted
to
a
very
different
use
there
was
among
the
monks
one
pere
charles
a
lusty
friar
of
whom
the
people
tell
strange
stories
some
young
women
of
the
town
were
seen
mounting
over
the
wall
by
a
ladder
of
ropes
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
there
was
an
unusual
crop
of
bastards
that
season
in
short
pere
charles
and
his
companions
gave
such
scandal
that
the
whole
fraternity
was
changed
and
now
the
nest
is
occupied
by
another
flight
of
these
birds
of
passage
if
one
of
our
privateers
had
kidnapped
a
capuchin
during
the
war
and
exhibited
him
in
his
habit
as
a
shew
in
london
he
would
have
proved
a
good
prize
to
the
captors
for
i
know
not
a
more
uncouth
and
grotesque
animal
than
an
old
capuchin
in
the
habit
of
his
order
a
friend
of
mine
a
swiss
officer
told
me
that
a
peasant
in
his
country
used
to
weep
bitterly
whenever
a
certain
capuchin
mounted
the
pulpit
to
hold
forth
to
the
people
the
good
father
took
notice
of
this
man
and
believed
he
was
touched
by
the
finger
of
the
lord
he
exhorted
him
to
encourage
these
accessions
of
grace
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
of
good
comfort
as
having
received
such
marks
of
the
divine
favour
the
man
still
continued
to
weep
as
before
every
time
the
monk
preached
and
at
last
the
capuchin
insisted
upon
knowing
what
it
was
in
his
discourse
or
appearance
that
made
such
an
impression
upon
his
heart
ah
father
cried
the
peasant
i
never
see
you
but
i
think
of
a
venerable
goat
which
i
lost
at
easter
we
were
bred
up
together
in
the
same
family
he
was
the
very
picture
of
your
reverence
one
would
swear
you
were
brothers
poor
baudouin
he
died
of
a
fall
rest
his
soul
i
would
willingly
pay
for
a
couple
of
masses
to
pray
him
out
of
purgatory
among
other
public
edifices
at
boulogne
there
is
an
hospital
or
workhouse
which
seems
to
be
established
upon
a
very
good
foundation
it
maintains
several
hundreds
of
poor
people
who
are
kept
constantly
at
work
according
to
their
age
and
abilities
in
making
thread
all
sorts
of
lace
a
kind
of
catgut
and
in
knitting
stockings
it
is
under
the
direction
of
the
bishop
and
the
see
is
at
present
filled
by
a
prelate
of
great
piety
and
benevolence
though
a
little
inclining
to
bigotry
and
fanaticism
the
churches
in
this
town
are
but
indifferently
built
and
poorly
ornamented
there
is
not
one
picture
in
the
place
worth
looking
at
nor
indeed
does
there
seem
to
be
the
least
taste
for
the
liberal
arts
in
my
next
i
shall
endeavour
to
satisfy
you
in
the
other
articles
you
desire
to
know
i
am
ever
yours
letter
iv
boulogne
september
sir
i
am
infinitely
obliged
to
h
for
the
favourable
manner
in
which
he
has
mentioned
me
to
the
earl
of
h
i
have
at
last
recovered
my
books
by
virtue
of
a
particular
order
to
the
director
of
the
douane
procured
by
the
application
of
the
english
resident
to
the
french
ministry
i
am
now
preparing
for
my
long
journey
but
before
i
leave
this
place
i
shall
send
you
the
packet
i
mentioned
by
meriton
i
must
fulfil
my
promise
in
communicating
the
observations
i
have
had
occasion
to
make
upon
this
town
and
country
the
air
of
boulogne
is
cold
and
moist
and
i
believe
of
consequence
unhealthy
last
winter
the
frost
which
continued
six
weeks
in
london
lasted
here
eight
weeks
without
intermission
and
the
cold
was
so
intense
that
in
the
garden
of
the
capuchins
it
split
the
bark
of
several
elms
from
top
to
bottom
on
our
arrival
here
we
found
all
kinds
of
fruit
more
backward
than
in
england
the
frost
in
its
progress
to
britain
is
much
weakened
in
crossing
the
sea
the
atmosphere
impregnated
with
saline
particles
resists
the
operation
of
freezing
hence
in
severe
winters
all
places
near
the
are
less
cold
than
more
inland
districts
this
is
the
reason
why
the
winter
is
often
more
mild
at
edinburgh
than
at
london
a
very
great
degree
of
cold
is
required
to
freeze
salt
water
indeed
it
will
not
freeze
at
all
until
it
has
deposited
all
its
salt
it
is
now
generally
allowed
among
philosophers
that
water
is
no
more
than
ice
thawed
by
heat
either
solar
or
subterranean
or
both
and
that
this
heat
being
expelled
it
would
return
to
its
natural
consistence
this
being
the
case
nothing
else
is
required
for
the
freezing
of
water
than
a
certain
degree
of
cold
which
may
be
generated
by
the
help
of
salt
or
spirit
of
nitre
even
under
the
line
i
would
propose
therefore
that
an
apparatus
of
this
sort
should
be
provided
in
every
ship
that
goes
to
sea
and
in
case
there
should
be
a
deficiency
of
fresh
water
on
board
the
seawater
may
be
rendered
potable
by
being
first
converted
into
ice
the
air
of
boulogne
is
not
only
loaded
with
a
great
evaporation
from
the
sea
increased
by
strong
gales
of
wind
from
the
west
and
which
blow
almost
continually
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
year
but
it
is
also
subject
to
putrid
vapours
arising
from
the
low
marshy
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
harbour
which
is
every
tide
overflowed
with
seawater
this
may
be
one
cause
of
the
scrofula
and
rickets
which
are
two
prevailing
disorders
among
the
children
in
boulogne
but
i
believe
the
former
is
more
owing
to
the
water
used
in
the
lower
town
which
is
very
hard
and
unwholsome
it
curdles
with
soap
gives
a
red
colour
to
the
meat
that
is
boiled
in
it
and
when
drank
by
strangers
never
fails
to
occasion
pains
in
the
stomach
and
bowels
nay
sometimes
produces
dysenteries
in
all
appearance
it
is
impregnated
with
nitre
if
not
with
something
more
mischievous
we
know
that
mundic
or
pyrites
very
often
contains
a
proportion
of
arsenic
mixed
with
sulphur
vitriol
and
mercury
perhaps
it
partakes
of
the
acid
of
some
coal
mine
for
there
are
coal
works
in
this
district
there
is
a
well
of
purging
water
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
upper
town
to
which
the
inhabitants
resort
in
the
morning
as
the
people
of
london
go
to
the
in
george
fields
there
is
likewise
a
fountain
of
excellent
water
hard
by
the
cathedral
in
the
upper
town
from
whence
i
am
daily
supplied
at
a
small
expence
some
modern
chemists
affirm
that
no
saline
chalybeate
waters
can
exist
except
in
the
neighbourhood
of
coal
damps
and
that
nothing
can
be
more
mild
and
gentle
and
friendly
to
the
constitution
than
the
said
damps
but
i
know
that
the
place
where
i
was
bred
stands
upon
a
zonic
of
coal
that
the
water
which
the
inhabitants
generally
use
is
hard
and
brackish
and
that
the
people
are
remarkably
subject
to
the
king
evil
and
consumption
these
i
would
impute
to
the
bad
water
impregnated
with
the
vitriol
and
brine
of
coal
as
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
air
that
should
render
such
distempers
endemial
that
the
air
of
boulogne
encourages
putrefaction
appears
from
the
effect
it
has
upon
butcher
meat
which
though
the
season
is
remarkably
cold
we
can
hardly
keep
hours
in
the
coolest
part
of
the
house
living
here
is
pretty
reasonable
and
the
markets
are
tolerably
supplied
the
beef
is
neither
fat
nor
firm
but
very
good
for
soup
which
is
the
only
use
the
french
make
of
it
the
veal
is
not
so
white
nor
so
well
fed
as
the
english
veal
but
it
is
more
juicy
and
better
tasted
the
mutton
and
pork
are
very
good
we
buy
our
poultry
alive
and
fatten
them
at
home
here
are
excellent
turkies
and
no
want
of
game
the
hares
in
particular
are
very
large
juicy
and
the
best
part
of
the
fish
caught
on
this
coast
is
sent
post
to
paris
in
by
a
company
of
contractors
like
those
of
hastings
in
sussex
nevertheless
we
have
excellent
soles
skaite
flounders
and
whitings
and
sometimes
mackarel
the
oysters
are
very
large
coarse
and
rank
there
is
very
little
fish
caught
on
the
french
coast
because
the
shallows
run
a
great
way
from
the
shore
and
the
fish
live
chiefly
in
deep
water
for
this
reason
the
fishermen
go
a
great
way
out
to
sea
sometimes
even
as
far
as
the
coast
of
england
notwithstanding
all
the
haste
the
contractors
can
make
their
fish
in
the
summer
is
very
often
spoiled
before
it
arrives
at
paris
and
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
considering
the
length
of
the
way
which
is
near
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
at
best
it
must
be
in
such
a
mortified
condition
that
no
other
people
except
the
negroes
on
the
coast
of
guinea
would
feed
upon
it
the
wine
commonly
drank
at
boulogne
comes
from
auxerre
is
very
small
and
meagre
and
may
be
had
from
five
to
eight
sols
a
bottle
that
is
from
halfpenny
to
fourpence
the
french
inhabitants
drink
no
good
wine
nor
is
there
any
to
be
had
unless
you
have
recourse
to
the
british
here
established
who
deal
in
bourdeaux
wines
brought
hither
by
sea
for
the
london
market
i
have
very
good
claret
from
a
friend
at
the
rate
of
sterling
a
bottle
and
excellent
small
beer
as
reasonable
as
in
england
i
do
believe
there
is
a
drop
of
generous
burgundy
in
the
place
and
the
aubergistes
impose
upon
us
shamefully
when
they
charge
it
at
two
livres
a
bottle
there
is
a
small
white
wine
called
preniac
which
is
very
agreeable
and
very
cheap
all
the
brandy
which
i
have
seen
in
boulogne
is
new
fiery
and
this
is
the
trash
which
the
smugglers
import
into
england
they
have
it
for
about
a
gallon
butcher
meat
is
sold
for
five
sols
or
halfpenny
a
pound
and
the
pound
here
consists
of
eighteen
ounces
i
have
a
young
turkey
for
thirty
sols
a
hare
for
a
couple
of
chickens
for
twenty
sols
and
a
couple
of
good
soles
for
the
same
price
before
we
left
england
we
were
told
that
there
was
no
fruit
in
boulogne
but
we
have
found
ourselves
agreeably
disappointed
in
this
particular
the
place
is
well
supplied
with
strawberries
cherries
gooseberries
corinths
peaches
apricots
and
excellent
pears
i
have
eaten
more
fruit
this
season
than
i
have
done
for
several
years
there
are
many
gardens
in
the
skirts
of
the
town
particularly
one
belonging
to
our
friend
b
where
we
often
drink
tea
in
a
charming
built
on
a
rising
ground
which
commands
a
delightful
prospect
of
the
sea
we
have
many
obligations
to
this
good
lady
who
is
a
kind
neighbour
an
obliging
friend
and
a
most
agreeable
companion
she
speaks
english
prettily
and
is
greatly
attached
to
the
people
and
the
customs
of
our
nation
they
use
wood
for
their
common
fewel
though
if
i
were
to
live
at
boulogne
i
would
mix
it
with
coal
which
this
country
affords
both
the
wood
and
the
coal
are
reasonable
enough
i
am
certain
that
a
man
may
keep
house
in
boulogne
for
about
one
half
of
what
it
will
cost
him
in
london
and
this
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
dearest
places
in
france
the
adjacent
country
is
very
agreeable
diversified
with
hill
and
dale
woods
and
meadows
there
is
a
forest
of
a
considerable
extent
that
begins
about
a
short
league
from
the
upper
town
it
belongs
to
the
king
and
the
wood
is
farmed
to
different
individuals
in
point
of
agriculture
the
people
in
this
neighbourhood
seem
to
have
profited
by
the
example
of
the
english
since
i
was
last
in
france
fifteen
years
ago
a
good
number
of
inclosures
and
plantations
have
been
made
in
the
english
fashion
there
is
a
good
many
tolerable
within
a
few
miles
of
boulogne
but
mostly
empty
i
was
offered
a
compleat
house
with
a
garden
of
four
acres
well
laid
out
and
two
fields
for
grass
or
hay
about
a
mile
from
the
town
for
four
hundred
livres
about
seventeen
pounds
a
year
it
is
partly
furnished
stands
in
an
agreeable
situation
with
a
fine
prospect
of
the
sea
and
was
lately
occupied
by
a
scotch
nobleman
who
is
in
the
service
of
france
to
judge
from
appearance
the
people
of
boulogne
are
descended
from
the
flemings
who
formerly
possessed
this
country
for
a
great
many
of
the
present
inhabitants
have
fine
skins
fair
hair
and
florid
complexions
very
different
from
the
natives
of
france
in
general
who
are
distinguished
by
black
hair
brown
skins
and
swarthy
faces
the
people
of
the
boulonnois
enjoy
some
extraordinary
privileges
and
in
particular
are
exempted
from
the
gabelle
or
duties
upon
salt
how
they
deserved
this
mark
of
favour
i
do
not
know
but
they
seem
to
have
a
spirit
of
independence
among
them
are
very
ferocious
and
much
addicted
to
revenge
many
barbarous
murders
are
committed
both
in
the
town
and
country
and
the
peasants
from
motives
of
envy
and
resentment
frequently
set
their
neighbours
houses
on
fire
several
instances
of
this
kind
have
happened
in
the
course
of
the
last
year
the
interruption
which
is
given
in
arbitrary
governments
to
the
administration
of
justice
by
the
interposition
of
the
great
has
always
a
bad
effect
upon
the
morals
of
the
common
people
the
peasants
too
are
often
rendered
desperate
and
savage
by
the
misery
they
suffer
from
the
oppression
and
tyranny
of
their
landlords
in
this
neighbourhood
the
labouring
people
are
ill
lodged
and
wretchedly
fed
and
they
have
no
idea
of
cleanliness
there
is
a
substantial
burgher
in
the
high
town
who
was
some
years
ago
convicted
of
a
most
barbarous
murder
he
received
sentence
to
be
broke
alive
upon
the
wheel
but
was
pardoned
by
the
interposition
of
the
governor
of
the
county
and
carries
on
his
business
as
usual
in
the
face
of
the
whole
community
a
furious
abbe
being
refused
orders
by
the
bishop
on
account
of
his
irregular
life
took
an
opportunity
to
stab
the
prelate
with
a
knife
one
sunday
as
he
walked
out
of
the
cathedral
the
good
bishop
desired
he
might
be
permitted
to
escape
but
it
was
thought
proper
to
punish
with
the
utmost
severity
such
an
atrocious
attempt
he
was
accordingly
apprehended
and
though
the
wound
was
not
mortal
condemned
to
be
broke
when
this
dreadful
sentence
was
executed
he
cried
out
that
it
was
hard
he
should
undergo
such
torments
for
having
wounded
a
worthless
priest
by
whom
he
had
been
injured
while
naming
the
burgher
mentioned
above
lived
in
ease
and
security
after
having
brutally
murdered
a
poor
man
and
a
helpless
woman
big
with
child
who
had
not
given
him
the
least
provocation
the
inhabitants
of
boulogne
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
the
noblesse
or
gentry
the
burghers
and
the
canaille
i
do
mention
the
clergy
and
the
people
belonging
to
the
law
because
i
shall
occasionally
trouble
you
with
my
thoughts
upon
the
religion
and
ecclesiastics
of
this
country
and
as
for
the
lawyers
exclusive
of
their
profession
they
may
be
considered
as
belonging
to
one
or
other
of
these
divisions
the
noblesse
are
vain
proud
poor
and
slothful
very
few
of
them
have
above
six
thousand
livres
a
year
which
may
amount
to
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
and
many
of
them
have
not
half
this
revenue
i
think
there
is
one
heiress
said
to
be
worth
one
hundred
thousand
livres
about
four
thousand
two
hundred
pounds
but
then
her
jewels
her
cloaths
and
even
her
linen
are
reckoned
part
of
this
fortune
the
noblesse
have
not
the
common
sense
to
reside
at
their
houses
in
the
country
where
by
farming
their
own
grounds
they
might
live
at
a
small
expence
and
improve
their
estates
at
the
same
time
they
allow
their
country
houses
to
go
to
decay
and
their
gardens
and
fields
to
waste
and
reside
in
dark
holes
in
the
upper
town
of
boulogne
without
light
air
or
convenience
there
they
starve
within
doors
that
they
may
have
wherewithal
to
purchase
fine
cloaths
and
appear
dressed
once
a
day
in
the
church
or
on
the
rampart
they
have
no
education
no
taste
for
reading
no
housewifery
nor
indeed
any
earthly
occupation
but
that
of
dressing
their
hair
and
adorning
their
bodies
they
hate
walking
and
would
never
go
abroad
if
they
were
not
stimulated
by
the
vanity
of
being
seen
i
ought
to
except
indeed
those
who
turn
devotees
and
spend
the
greatest
part
of
their
time
with
the
priest
either
at
church
or
in
their
own
houses
other
amusements
they
have
none
in
this
place
except
private
parties
of
which
are
far
from
being
expensive
nothing
can
be
more
parsimonious
than
the
oeconomy
of
these
people
they
live
upon
soupe
and
bouille
fish
and
sallad
they
never
think
of
giving
dinners
or
entertaining
their
friends
they
even
save
the
expence
of
coffee
and
tea
though
both
are
very
cheap
at
boulogne
they
presume
that
every
person
drinks
coffee
at
home
immediately
after
dinner
which
is
always
over
by
one
and
in
lieu
of
tea
in
the
afternoon
they
treat
with
a
glass
of
sherbet
or
capillaire
in
a
word
i
know
not
a
more
insignificant
set
of
mortals
than
the
noblesse
of
boulogne
helpless
in
themselves
and
useless
to
the
community
without
dignity
sense
or
sentiment
contemptible
from
pride
and
ridiculous
from
vanity
they
pretend
to
be
jealous
of
their
rank
and
will
entertain
no
correspondence
with
the
merchants
whom
they
term
plebeians
they
likewise
keep
at
a
great
distance
from
strangers
on
pretence
of
a
delicacy
in
the
article
of
punctilio
but
as
i
am
informed
this
stateliness
is
in
a
great
measure
affected
in
order
to
conceal
their
poverty
which
would
appear
to
greater
disadvantage
if
they
admitted
of
a
more
familiar
communication
considering
the
vivacity
of
the
french
people
one
would
imagine
they
could
not
possibly
lead
such
an
insipid
life
altogether
unanimated
by
society
or
diversion
true
it
is
the
only
profane
diversions
of
this
place
are
a
and
a
mountebank
but
then
their
religion
affords
a
perpetual
comedy
their
high
masses
their
feasts
their
processions
their
pilgrimages
confessions
images
tapers
robes
incense
benedictions
spectacles
representations
and
innumerable
ceremonies
which
revolve
almost
incessantly
furnish
a
variety
of
entertainment
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
if
superstition
implies
fear
never
was
a
word
more
misapplied
than
it
is
to
the
mummery
of
the
religion
of
rome
the
people
are
so
far
from
being
impressed
with
awe
and
religious
terror
by
this
sort
of
machinery
that
it
amuses
their
imaginations
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
and
keeps
them
always
in
good
humour
a
roman
catholic
longs
as
impatiently
for
the
festival
of
suaire
or
croix
or
veronique
as
a
schoolboy
in
england
for
the
representation
of
punch
and
the
devil
and
there
is
generally
as
much
laughing
at
one
farce
as
at
the
other
even
when
the
descent
from
the
cross
is
acted
in
the
holy
week
with
all
the
circumstances
that
ought
naturally
to
inspire
the
gravest
sentiments
if
you
cast
your
eyes
among
the
multitude
that
croud
the
place
you
will
not
discover
one
melancholy
face
all
is
prattling
tittering
or
laughing
and
ten
to
one
but
you
perceive
a
number
of
them
employed
in
hissing
the
female
who
personates
the
virgin
mary
and
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
that
the
roman
catholics
not
content
with
the
infinite
number
of
saints
who
really
existed
have
not
only
personified
the
cross
but
made
two
female
saints
out
of
a
piece
of
linen
veronique
or
veronica
is
no
other
than
a
corruption
of
vera
icon
or
vera
effigies
said
to
be
the
exact
representation
of
our
saviour
face
impressed
upon
a
piece
of
linen
with
which
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
in
his
way
to
the
place
of
crucifixion
the
same
is
worshipped
under
the
name
of
suaire
from
the
latin
word
sudarium
this
same
handkerchief
is
said
to
have
had
three
folds
on
every
one
of
which
was
the
impression
one
of
these
remains
at
jerusalem
a
second
was
brought
to
rome
and
a
third
was
conveyed
to
spain
baronius
says
there
is
a
very
antient
history
of
the
sancta
facies
in
the
vatican
tillemont
however
looks
upon
the
whole
as
a
fable
some
suppose
veronica
to
be
the
same
with
haemorrhoissa
the
patroness
of
those
who
are
afflicted
with
the
piles
who
make
their
joint
invocations
to
her
and
fiacre
the
son
of
a
scotch
king
who
lived
and
died
a
hermit
in
france
the
troops
of
henry
of
england
are
said
to
have
pillaged
the
chapel
of
this
highland
saint
who
in
revenge
assisted
his
countrymen
in
the
french
service
to
defeat
the
english
at
bauge
and
afterwards
afflicted
henry
with
the
piles
of
which
he
died
this
prince
complained
that
he
was
not
only
plagued
by
the
living
scots
but
even
persecuted
by
those
who
were
dead
i
know
not
whether
i
may
be
allowed
to
compare
the
romish
religion
to
comedy
and
calvinism
to
tragedy
the
first
amuses
the
senses
and
excites
ideas
of
mirth
and
the
other
like
tragedy
deals
in
the
passions
of
terror
and
pity
step
into
a
conventicle
of
dissenters
you
will
ten
to
one
hear
the
minister
holding
forth
upon
the
sufferings
of
christ
or
the
torments
of
hell
and
see
many
marks
of
religious
horror
in
the
faces
of
the
hearers
this
is
perhaps
one
reason
why
the
reformation
did
not
succeed
in
france
among
a
volatile
giddy
unthinking
people
shocked
at
the
mortified
appearances
of
the
calvinists
and
accounts
for
its
rapid
progress
among
nations
of
a
more
melancholy
turn
of
character
and
complexion
for
in
the
conversion
of
the
multitude
reason
is
generally
out
of
the
question
even
the
penance
imposed
upon
the
catholics
is
little
more
than
mock
mortification
a
murderer
is
often
quit
with
his
confessor
for
saying
three
prayers
extraordinary
and
these
easy
terms
on
which
absolution
is
obtained
certainly
encourage
the
repetition
of
the
most
enormous
crimes
the
pomp
and
ceremonies
of
this
religion
together
with
the
great
number
of
holidays
they
observe
howsoever
they
may
keep
up
the
spirits
of
the
commonalty
and
help
to
diminish
the
sense
of
their
own
misery
must
certainly
at
the
same
time
produce
a
frivolous
taste
for
frippery
and
shew
and
encourage
a
habit
of
idleness
to
which
i
in
a
great
measure
ascribe
the
extreme
poverty
of
the
lower
people
very
near
half
of
their
time
which
might
he
profitably
employed
in
the
exercise
of
industry
is
lost
to
themselves
and
the
community
in
attendance
upon
the
different
exhibitions
of
religious
mummery
but
as
this
letter
has
already
run
to
an
unconscionable
length
i
shall
defer
till
another
occasion
what
i
have
further
to
say
on
the
people
of
this
place
and
in
the
mean
time
assure
you
that
i
am
always
yours

letter
v
boulogne
september
dear
sir
my
stay
in
this
place
now
draws
towards
a
period
within
these
few
days
i
have
continued
bathing
with
some
advantage
to
my
health
though
the
season
has
been
cold
and
wet
and
disagreeable
there
was
a
fine
prospect
of
a
plentiful
harvest
in
this
neighbourhood
i
used
to
have
great
pleasure
in
driving
between
the
fields
of
wheat
oats
and
barley
but
the
crop
has
been
entirely
ruined
by
the
rain
and
nothing
is
now
to
be
seen
on
the
ground
but
the
tarnished
straw
and
the
rotten
spoils
of
the
husbandman
labour
the
ground
scarce
affords
subsistence
to
a
few
flocks
of
meagre
sheep
that
crop
the
stubble
and
the
intervening
grass
each
flock
under
the
protection
of
its
shepherd
with
his
crook
and
dogs
who
lies
every
night
in
the
midst
of
the
fold
in
a
little
thatched
travelling
lodge
mounted
on
a
here
he
passes
the
night
in
order
to
defend
his
flock
from
the
wolves
which
are
sometimes
especially
in
winter
very
bold
and
desperate
two
days
ago
we
made
an
excursion
with
b
and
capt
l
to
the
village
of
samers
on
the
paris
road
about
three
leagues
from
boulogne
here
is
a
venerable
abbey
of
benedictines
well
endowed
with
large
agreeable
gardens
prettily
laid
out
the
monks
are
well
lodged
and
well
entertained
tho
restricted
from
flesh
meals
by
the
rules
of
their
order
they
are
allowed
to
eat
wild
duck
and
teal
as
a
species
of
fish
and
when
they
long
for
a
good
bouillon
or
a
partridge
or
pullet
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
say
they
are
out
of
order
in
that
case
the
appetite
of
the
patient
is
indulged
in
his
own
apartment
their
church
is
elegantly
contrived
but
kept
in
a
very
dirty
condition
the
greatest
curiosity
i
saw
in
this
place
was
an
english
boy
about
eight
or
nine
years
old
whom
his
father
had
sent
hither
to
learn
the
french
language
in
less
than
eight
weeks
he
was
become
captain
of
the
boys
of
the
place
spoke
french
perfectly
well
and
had
almost
forgot
his
mother
tongue
but
to
return
to
the
people
of
boulogne
the
burghers
here
as
in
other
places
consist
of
merchants
and
artisans
some
of
the
merchants
have
got
fortunes
by
fitting
out
privateers
during
the
war
a
great
many
single
ships
were
taken
from
the
english
notwithstanding
the
good
of
our
cruisers
who
were
so
alert
that
the
privateers
from
this
coast
were
often
taken
in
four
hours
after
they
sailed
from
the
french
harbour
and
there
is
hardly
a
captain
of
an
armateur
in
boulogne
who
has
not
been
prisoner
in
england
five
or
six
times
in
the
course
of
the
war
they
were
fitted
out
at
a
very
small
expence
and
used
to
run
over
in
the
night
to
the
coast
of
england
where
they
hovered
as
english
fishing
smacks
until
they
kidnapped
some
coaster
with
which
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
across
the
channel
if
they
fell
in
with
a
british
cruiser
they
surrendered
without
resistance
the
captain
was
soon
exchanged
and
the
loss
of
the
proprietor
was
not
great
if
they
brought
their
prize
safe
into
harbour
the
advantage
was
considerable
in
time
of
peace
the
merchants
of
boulogne
deal
in
wine
brandies
and
oil
imported
from
the
south
and
export
fish
with
the
manufactures
of
france
to
portugal
and
other
countries
but
the
trade
is
not
great
here
are
two
or
three
considerable
houses
of
wine
merchants
from
britain
who
deal
in
bourdeaux
wine
with
which
they
supply
london
and
other
parts
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
the
fishery
of
mackarel
and
herring
is
so
considerable
on
this
coast
that
it
is
said
to
yield
annually
eight
or
nine
hundred
thousand
livres
about
thousand
pounds
sterling
the
here
drive
a
considerable
traffic
with
the
english
smugglers
whose
cutters
are
almost
the
only
vessels
one
sees
in
the
harbour
of
boulogne
if
we
except
about
a
dozen
of
those
boats
which
raised
such
alarms
in
england
in
the
course
of
the
war
indeed
they
seem
to
be
good
for
nothing
else
and
perhaps
they
were
built
for
this
purpose
only
the
smugglers
from
the
coast
of
kent
and
sussex
pay
english
gold
for
great
quantities
of
french
brandy
tea
coffee
and
small
wine
which
they
run
from
this
country
they
likewise
buy
glass
trinkets
toys
and
coloured
prints
which
sell
in
england
for
no
other
reason
but
that
they
come
from
france
as
they
may
be
had
as
cheap
and
much
better
finished
of
our
own
manufacture
they
likewise
take
off
ribbons
laces
linen
and
cambrics
though
this
branch
of
trade
is
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
traders
that
come
from
london
and
make
their
purchases
at
dunkirk
where
they
pay
no
duties
it
is
certainly
worth
while
for
any
traveller
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
linen
either
at
dunkirk
or
boulogne
the
difference
of
the
price
at
these
two
places
is
not
great
even
here
i
have
made
a
provision
of
shirts
for
one
half
of
the
money
they
would
have
cost
in
london
undoubtedly
the
practice
of
smuggling
is
very
detrimental
to
the
fair
trader
and
carries
considerable
sums
of
money
out
of
the
kingdom
to
enrich
our
rivals
and
enemies
the
officers
are
very
watchful
and
make
a
great
number
of
seizures
nevertheless
the
smugglers
find
their
account
in
continuing
this
contraband
commerce
and
are
said
to
indemnify
themselves
if
they
save
one
cargo
out
of
three
after
all
the
best
way
to
prevent
smuggling
is
to
lower
the
duties
upon
the
commodities
which
are
thus
introduced
i
have
been
told
that
the
revenue
upon
tea
has
encreased
ever
since
the
duty
upon
it
was
diminished
by
the
bye
the
tea
smuggled
on
the
coast
of
sussex
is
most
execrable
stuff
while
i
stayed
at
hastings
for
the
conveniency
of
bathing
i
must
have
changed
my
breakfast
if
i
had
not
luckily
brought
tea
with
me
from
london
yet
we
have
as
good
tea
at
boulogne
for
nine
livres
a
pound
as
that
which
sells
at
fourteen
shillings
at
london
the
bourgeois
of
this
place
seem
to
live
at
their
ease
probably
in
consequence
of
their
trade
with
the
english
their
houses
consist
of
the
one
story
above
and
garrets
in
those
which
are
well
furnished
you
see
and
marble
slabs
but
the
chairs
are
either
paultry
things
made
with
straw
bottoms
which
cost
about
a
shilling
or
seats
of
stuffed
very
clumsy
and
incommodious
the
tables
are
square
fir
boards
that
stand
on
edge
in
a
corner
except
when
they
are
used
and
then
they
are
set
upon
cross
legs
that
open
and
shut
occasionally
the
king
of
france
dines
off
a
board
of
this
kind
here
is
plenty
of
however
the
poorest
tradesman
in
boulogne
has
a
napkin
on
every
cover
and
silver
forks
with
four
prongs
which
are
used
with
the
right
hand
there
being
very
little
occasion
for
knives
for
the
meat
is
boiled
or
roasted
to
rags
the
french
beds
are
so
high
that
sometimes
one
is
obliged
to
mount
them
by
the
help
of
steps
and
this
is
also
the
case
in
flanders
they
very
seldom
use
but
they
lie
upon
a
paillasse
or
bag
of
straw
over
which
are
laid
two
and
sometimes
three
mattrasses
their
testers
are
high
and
and
their
curtains
generally
of
thin
bays
red
or
green
laced
with
taudry
yellow
in
imitation
of
gold
in
some
houses
however
one
meets
with
furniture
of
stamped
linen
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
carpet
to
be
seen
and
the
floors
are
in
a
very
dirty
condition
they
have
not
even
the
implements
of
cleanliness
in
this
country
every
chamber
is
furnished
with
an
armoire
or
and
a
chest
of
drawers
of
very
clumsy
workmanship
every
thing
shews
a
deficiency
in
the
mechanic
arts
there
is
not
a
door
nor
a
window
that
shuts
close
the
hinges
locks
and
latches
are
of
iron
coarsely
made
and
ill
contrived
the
very
chimnies
are
built
so
open
that
they
admit
both
rain
and
sun
and
all
of
them
smoke
intolerably
if
there
is
no
cleanliness
among
these
people
much
less
shall
we
find
delicacy
which
is
the
cleanliness
of
the
mind
indeed
they
are
utter
strangers
to
what
we
call
common
decency
and
i
could
give
you
some
instances
at
which
even
a
native
of
edinburgh
would
stop
his
nose
there
are
certain
mortifying
views
of
human
nature
which
undoubtedly
ought
to
be
concealed
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
prevent
giving
offence
and
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
to
plead
the
difference
of
custom
in
different
countries
in
defence
of
these
usages
which
can
not
fail
giving
disgust
to
the
organs
and
senses
of
all
mankind
will
custom
exempt
from
the
imputation
of
gross
indecency
a
french
lady
who
shifts
her
frowsy
smock
in
presence
of
a
male
visitant
and
talks
to
him
of
her
lavement
her
medecine
and
her
bidet
an
italian

no
scruple
of
telling
you

known

admirer
who
stood
at
the
door
and
entertained
her
with

all
the

she
was
within
but
i
should
be
glad
to
know
whether
it
is
possible
for
a
fine
lady
to
speak
and
act
in
this
manner
without
exciting
ideas
to
her
own
disadvantage
in
the
mind
of
every
man
who
has
any
imagination
left
and
enjoys
the
entire
use
of
his
senses
howsoever
she
may
be
authorised
by
the
customs
of
her
country
there
is
nothing
so
vile
or
repugnant
to

you
may
plead
prescription
for
it

customs
of
some
nation

delight
to
honour

feast
upon

intestines
with
their
contents
as
the
greatest
dainty
that
can
be
presented
a
frenchman
dips
his
fingers
imbrowned
with
snuff
into
his
plate
filled
with
ragout
between
every
three
mouthfuls
he
produces
his
and
takes
a
fresh
pinch
with
the
most
graceful
gesticulations
then
he
displays
his
handkerchief
which
may
be
termed
the
flag
of
abomination
and
in
the
use
of
both
scatters
his
favours
among
those
who
have
the
happiness
to
sit
near
him
it
must
be
owned
however
that
a
frenchman
will
not
drink
out
of
a
tankard
in
which
perhaps
a
dozen
of
filthy
mouths
have
flabbered
as
is
the
custom
in
england
here
every
individual
has
his
own
gobelet
which
stands
before
him
and
he
helps
himself
occasionally
with
wine
or
water
or
both
which
likewise
stand
upon
the
table
but
i
know
no
custom
more
beastly
than
that
of
using
in
which
polite
company
spirt
and
squirt
and
spue
the
filthy
scourings
of
their
gums
under
the
eyes
of
each
other
i
knew
a
lover
cured
of
his
passion
by
seeing
this
nasty
cascade
discharged
from
the
mouth
of
his
mistress
i
do
doubt
but
i
shall
live
to
see
the
day
when
the
hospitable
custom
of
the
antient
aegyptians
will
be
revived
then
a
conveniency
will
be
placed
behind
every
chair
in
company
with
a
proper
provision
of
waste
paper
that
individuals
may
make
themselves
easy
without
parting
company
i
insist
upon
it
that
this
practice
would
not
be
more
indelicate
than
that
which
is
now
in
use
what
then
you
will
say
must
a
man
sit
with
his
chops
and
fingers
up
to
the
ears
and
knuckles
in
grease
no
let
those
who
can
not
eat
without
defiling
themselves
step
into
another
room
provided
with
basons
and
towels
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
institute
schools
where
youth
may
learn
to
eat
their
victuals
without
daubing
themselves
or
giving
offence
to
the
eyes
of
one
another
the
bourgeois
of
boulogne
have
commonly
soup
and
bouilli
at
noon
and
a
roast
with
a
sallad
for
supper
and
at
all
their
meals
there
is
a
dessert
of
fruit
this
indeed
is
the
practice
all
over
france
on
meagre
days
they
eat
fish
omelettes
fried
beans
fricassees
of
eggs
and
onions
and
burnt
cream
the
tea
which
they
drink
in
the
afternoon
is
rather
boiled
than
infused
it
is
sweetened
all
together
with
coarse
sugar
and
drank
with
an
equal
quantity
of
boiled
milk
we
had
the
honour
to
be
entertained
the
other
day
by
our
landlord
b
who
spared
no
cost
on
this
banquet
exhibited
for
the
glory
of
france
he
had
invited
a
newmarried
couple
together
with
the
mother
and
the
lady
father
who
was
one
of
the
noblesse
of
montreuil
his
name
mons
l
y
there
were
likewise
some
merchants
of
the
town
and
mons
b
uncle
a
facetious
little
man
who
had
served
in
the
english
navy
and
was
as
big
and
as
round
as
a
hogshead
we
were
likewise
favoured
with
the
company
of
father
k
a
native
of
ireland
who
is
vicaire
or
curate
of
the
parish
and
among
the
guests
was
mons
l
y
son
a
pretty
boy
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
the
repas
served
up
in
three
services
or
courses
with
entrees
and
hors
exclusive
of
the
fruit
consisted
of
about
twenty
dishes
extremely
well
dressed
by
the
rotisseur
who
is
the
best
cook
i
ever
knew
in
france
or
elsewhere
but
the
plates
were
not
presented
with
much
order
our
young
ladies
did
not
seem
to
be
much
used
to
do
the
honours
of
the
table
the
most
extraordinary
circumstance
that
i
observed
on
this
occasion
as
that
all
the
french
who
were
present
ate
of
every
dish
that
appeared
and
i
am
told
that
if
there
had
been
an
hundred
articles
more
they
would
have
had
a
trial
of
each
this
is
what
they
call
doing
justice
to
the
founder
mons
l
y
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
indeed
he
was
the
oracle
and
orator
of
the
company
tall
thin
and
not
unlike
the
picture
of
don
quixote
after
he
had
lost
his
teeth
he
had
been
garde
du
corps
or
at
versailles
and
by
virtue
of
this
office
he
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
persons
of
the
king
and
the
dauphin
with
the
characters
of
the
ministers
and
grandees
and
in
a
word
with
all
the
secrets
of
state
on
which
he
held
forth
with
equal
solemnity
and
elocution
he
exclaimed
against
the
jesuits
and
the
farmers
of
the
revenue
who
he
said
had
ruined
france
then
addressing
himself
to
me
asked
if
the
english
did
not
every
day
drink
to
the
health
of
madame
la
marquise
i
did
not
at
first
comprehend
his
meaning
but
answered
in
general
that
the
english
were
not
deficient
in
complaisance
for
the
ladies
ah
cried
he
she
is
the
best
friend
they
have
in
the
world
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
they
would
not
have
such
reason
to
boast
of
the
advantages
of
the
war
i
told
him
the
only
conquest
which
the
french
had
made
in
the
war
was
atchieved
by
one
of
her
generals
i
meant
the
taking
of
mahon
but
i
did
not
choose
to
prosecute
the
discourse
remembering
that
in
the
year
i
had
like
to
have
had
an
affair
with
a
frenchman
at
ghent
who
affirmed
that
all
the
battles
gained
by
the
great
duke
of
marlborough
were
purposely
lost
by
the
french
generals
in
order
to
bring
the
schemes
of
madame
de
maintenon
into
disgrace
this
is
no
bad
resource
for
the
national
vanity
of
these
people
though
in
general
they
are
really
persuaded
that
theirs
is
the
richest
the
bravest
the
happiest
and
the
most
powerful
nation
under
the
sun
and
therefore
without
some
such
cause
they
must
be
invincible
by
the
bye
the
common
people
here
still
frighten
their
wayward
children
with
the
name
of
marlborough
b
son
who
was
nursed
at
a
peasant
house
happening
one
day
after
he
was
brought
home
to
be
in
disgrace
with
his
father
who
threatened
to
correct
him
the
child
ran
for
protection
to
his
mother
crying
faites
sortir
ce
vilaine
malbroug
turn
out
that
rogue
marlborough
it
is
amazing
to
hear
a
sensible
frenchman
assert
that
the
revenues
of
france
amount
to
four
hundred
millions
of
livres
about
twenty
millions
sterling
clear
of
all
incumbrances
when
in
fact
their
clear
revenue
is
not
much
above
ten
without
all
doubt
they
have
reason
to
inveigh
against
the
fermiers
generaux
who
oppress
the
people
in
raising
the
taxes
not
above
of
which
are
brought
into
the
coffers
the
rest
enriches
themselves
and
enables
them
to
bribe
high
for
the
protection
of
the
great
which
is
the
only
support
they
have
against
the
remonstrances
of
the
states
and
parliaments
and
the
suggestions
of
common
sense
which
will
ever
demonstrate
this
to
be
of
all
others
the
most
pernicious
method
of
supplying
the
necessities
of
government
mons
l
y
seasoned
the
severity
of
his
political
apothegms
with
intermediate
sallies
of
mirth
and
gallantry
he
ogled
the
venerable
gentlewoman
his
commere
who
sat
by
him
he
looked
sighed
and
languished
sung
tender
songs
and
kissed
the
old
lady
hand
with
all
the
ardour
of
a
youthful
admirer
i
unfortunately
congratulated
him
on
having
such
a
pretty
young
gentleman
to
his
son
he
answered
sighing
that
the
boy
had
talents
but
did
not
put
them
to
a
proper
use
long
before
i
attained
his
age
said
he
i
had
finished
my
rhetoric
captain
b
who
had
eaten
himself
black
in
the
face
and
with
the
napkin
under
his
chin
was
no
bad
representation
of
sancho
panza
in
the
suds
with
the
dishclout
about
his
neck
when
the
duke
scullions
insisted
upon
shaving
him
this
turning
to
the
boy
with
a
waggish
leer
i
suppose
said
he
you
do
understand
the
figure
of
amplification
so
well
as
monsieur
your
father
at
that
instant
one
of
the
nieces
who
knew
her
uncle
to
be
very
ticklish
touched
him
under
the
short
ribs
on
which
the
little
man
attempted
to
spring
up
but
lost
the
centre
of
gravity
he
overturned
his
own
plate
in
the
lap
of
the
person
that
sat
next
to
him
and
falling
obliquely
upon
his
own
chair
both
tumbled
down
upon
the
floor
together
to
the
great
discomposure
of
the
whole
company
for
the
poor
man
would
have
been
actually
strangled
had
not
his
nephew
loosed
his
stock
with
great
expedition
matters
being
once
more
adjusted
and
the
captain
condoled
on
his
disaster
mons
l
y
took
it
in
his
head
to
read
his
son
a
lecture
upon
filial
obedience
this
was
mingled
with
some
sharp
reproof
which
the
boy
took
so
ill
that
he
retired
the
old
lady
observed
that
he
had
been
too
severe
her
who
was
very
pretty
said
her
brother
had
given
him
too
much
reason
hinting
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
addicted
to
some
terrible
vices
upon
which
several
individuals
repeated
the
interjection
ah
ah
yes
said
mons
l
y
with
a
rueful
aspect
the
boy
has
a
pernicious
turn
for
gaming
in
one
afternoon
he
lost
at
billiards
such
a
sum
as
gives
me
horror
to
think
of
it
fifty
sols
in
one
afternoon
cried
the
sister
fifty
sols
exclaimed
the
with
marks
of
astonishment
that
too
much
that
too
much
he
to
blame
he
to
blame
but
youth
you
know
mons
l
y
ah
vive
la
jeunesse
et
cried
the
father
wiping
his
eyes
squeezing
her
hand
and
looking
tenderly
upon
her
b
took
this
opportunity
to
bring
in
the
young
gentleman
who
was
admitted
into
favour
and
received
a
second
exhortation
thus
harmony
was
restored
and
the
entertainment
concluded
with
fruit
coffee
and
liqueurs
when
a
bourgeois
of
boulogne
takes
the
air
he
goes
in
a
chaise
which
is
here
called
cabriolet
and
hires
it
for
a
day
there
are
also
travelling
chaises
which
hold
four
persons
two
seated
with
their
faces
to
the
horses
and
two
behind
their
backs
but
those
vehicles
are
all
very
ill
made
and
extremely
inconvenient
the
way
of
riding
most
used
in
this
place
is
on
assback
you
will
see
every
day
in
the
skirts
of
the
town
a
great
number
of
females
thus
mounted
with
the
feet
on
either
side
occasionally
according
as
the
wind
blows
so
that
sometimes
the
right
and
sometimes
the
left
hand
guides
the
beast
but
in
other
parts
of
france
as
well
as
in
italy
the
ladies
sit
on
horseback
with
their
legs
astride
and
are
provided
with
drawers
for
that
purpose
when
i
said
the
french
people
were
kept
in
good
humour
by
the
fopperies
of
their
religion
i
did
not
mean
that
there
were
no
gloomy
spirits
among
them
there
will
be
fanatics
in
religion
while
there
are
people
of
a
saturnine
disposition
and
melancholy
turn
of
mind
the
character
of
a
devotee
which
is
hardly
known
in
england
is
very
common
here
you
see
them
walking
to
and
from
church
at
all
hours
in
their
hoods
and
long
camblet
cloaks
with
a
slow
pace
demure
aspect
and
downcast
eye
those
who
are
poor
become
very
troublesome
to
the
monks
with
their
scruples
and
cases
of
conscience
you
may
see
them
on
their
knees
at
the
confessional
every
hour
in
the
day
the
rich
devotee
has
her
favourite
confessor
whom
she
consults
and
regales
in
private
at
her
own
house
and
this
spiritual
director
generally
governs
the
whole
family
for
my
part
i
never
knew
a
fanatic
that
was
not
an
hypocrite
at
bottom
their
pretensions
to
superior
sanctity
and
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
the
passions
which
human
reason
was
never
yet
able
to
subdue
introduce
a
habit
of
dissimulation
which
like
all
other
habits
is
confirmed
by
use
till
at
length
they
become
adepts
in
the
art
and
science
of
hypocrisy
enthusiasm
and
hypocrisy
are
by
no
means
incompatible
the
wildest
fanatics
i
ever
knew
were
real
sensualists
in
their
way
of
living
and
cunning
cheats
in
their
dealings
with
mankind
among
the
lower
class
of
people
at
boulogne
those
who
take
the
lead
are
the
men
who
live
in
one
quarter
divided
into
classes
and
registered
for
the
service
of
the
king
they
are
hardy
and
exercise
the
trade
of
fishermen
and
boatmen
and
propagate
like
rabbits
they
have
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
a
miraculous
image
of
the
virgin
mary
which
is
kept
in
one
of
their
churches
and
every
year
carried
in
procession
according
to
the
legend
this
image
was
carried
off
with
other
pillage
by
the
english
when
they
took
boulogne
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
the
lady
rather
than
reside
in
england
where
she
found
a
great
many
heretics
trusted
herself
alone
in
an
open
boat
and
crossed
the
sea
to
the
road
of
boulogne
where
she
was
seen
waiting
for
a
pilot
accordingly
a
boat
put
off
to
her
assistance
and
brought
her
safe
into
the
harbour
since
which
time
she
has
continued
to
patronize
the
watermen
of
boulogne
at
present
she
is
very
black
and
very
ugly
besides
being
cruelly
mutilated
in
different
parts
of
her
body
which
i
suppose
have
been
amputated
and
converted
into
but
once
a
year
she
is
dressed
in
very
rich
attire
and
carried
in
procession
with
a
silver
boat
provided
at
the
expence
of
the
sailors
that
vanity
which
characterises
the
french
extends
even
to
the
canaille
the
lowest
creature
among
them
is
sure
to
have
her
and
golden
cross
hanging
about
her
neck
indeed
this
last
is
an
implement
of
superstition
as
well
as
of
dress
without
which
no
female
appears
the
common
people
here
as
in
all
countries
where
they
live
poorly
and
dirtily
are
and
of
very
brown
or
rather
tawny
complexions
as
they
seldom
eat
meat
their
juices
are
destitute
of
that
animal
oil
which
gives
a
plumpness
and
smoothness
to
the
skin
and
defends
those
fine
capillaries
from
the
injuries
of
the
weather
which
would
otherwise
coalesce
or
be
shrunk
up
so
as
to
impede
the
circulation
on
the
external
surface
of
the
body
as
for
the
dirt
it
undoubtedly
blocks
up
the
pores
of
the
skin
and
disorders
the
perspiration
consequently
must
contribute
to
the
scurvy
itch
and
other
cutaneous
distempers
in
the
quarter
of
the
matelots
at
boulogne
there
is
a
number
of
poor
canadians
who
were
removed
from
the
island
of
john
in
the
gulph
of
laurence
when
it
was
reduced
by
the
english
these
people
are
maintained
at
the
expence
of
the
king
who
allows
them
soldier
pay
that
is
five
sols
or
halfpenny
a
day
or
rather
three
sols
and
ammunition
bread
how
the
soldiers
contrive
to
subsist
upon
this
wretched
allowance
i
can
not
comprehend
but
it
must
be
owned
that
those
invalids
who
do
duty
at
boulogne
betray
no
marks
of
want
they
are
hale
and
stout
neatly
and
decently
cloathed
and
on
the
whole
look
better
than
the
pensioners
of
chelsea
about
three
weeks
ago
i
was
favoured
with
a
visit
by
one
m
an
english
gentleman
who
seems
far
gone
in
a
consumption
he
passed
the
last
winter
at
nismes
in
languedoc
and
found
himself
much
better
in
the
beginning
of
summer
when
he
embarked
at
cette
and
returned
by
sea
to
england
he
soon
relapsed
however
and
as
he
imagines
in
consequence
of
a
cold
caught
at
sea
he
told
me
his
intention
was
to
try
the
south
again
and
even
to
go
as
far
as
italy
i
advised
him
to
make
trial
of
the
air
of
nice
where
i
myself
proposed
to
reside
he
seemed
to
relish
my
advice
and
proceeded
towards
paris
in
his
own
carriage
i
shall
ship
my
great
chests
on
board
of
a
ship
bound
to
bourdeaux
they
are
directed
and
recommended
to
the
care
of
a
merchant
of
that
place
who
will
forward
them
by
thoulouse
and
the
canal
of
languedoc
to
his
correspondent
at
cette
which
is
the
of
montpellier
the
charge
of
their
conveyance
to
bourdeaux
does
not
exceed
one
guinea
they
consist
of
two
very
large
chests
and
a
trunk
about
a
thousand
pounds
weight
and
the
expence
of
transporting
them
from
bourdeaux
to
cette
will
not
exceed
thirty
livres
they
are
already
sealed
with
lead
at
the
customhouse
that
they
may
be
exempted
from
further
visitation
this
is
a
precaution
which
every
traveller
takes
both
by
sea
and
land
he
must
likewise
provide
himself
with
a
at
the
bureau
otherwise
he
may
be
stopped
and
rummaged
at
every
town
through
which
he
passes
i
have
hired
a
berline
and
four
horses
to
paris
for
fourteen
two
of
which
the
voiturier
is
obliged
to
pay
for
a
permission
from
the
farmers
of
the
poste
for
every
thing
is
farmed
in
this
country
and
if
you
hire
a
carriage
as
i
have
done
you
must
pay
twelve
livres
or
for
every
person
that
travels
in
it
the
common
coach
between
calais
and
paris
is
such
a
vehicle
as
no
man
would
use
who
has
any
regard
to
his
own
case
and
convenience
and
it
travels
at
the
pace
of
an
english
waggon
in
ten
days
i
shall
set
out
on
my
journey
and
i
shall
leave
boulogne
with
regret
i
have
been
happy
in
the
acquaintance
of
b
and
a
few
british
families
in
the
place
and
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
meet
here
with
two
honest
gentlemen
whom
i
had
formerly
known
in
paris
as
well
as
with
some
of
my
countrymen
officers
in
the
service
of
france
my
next
will
be
from
paris
remember
me
to
our
friends
at
a
i
am
a
little
at
the
prospect
of
removing
to
such
a
distance
from
you
it
is
a
moot
point
whether
i
shall
ever
return
my
health
is
very
precarious
adieu
letter
vi
paris
october
dear
sir
of
our
journey
from
boulogne
i
have
little
to
say
the
weather
was
favourable
and
the
roads
were
in
tolerable
order
we
found
good
accommodation
at
montreuil
and
amiens
but
in
every
other
place
where
we
stopped
we
met
with
abundance
of
dirt
and
the
most
flagrant
imposition
i
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
cities
of
abbeville
and
amiens
which
we
saw
only
en
passant
nor
take
up
your
time
with
an
account
of
the
stables
and
palace
of
chantilly
belonging
to
the
prince
of
conde
which
we
visited
the
last
day
of
our
journey
nor
shall
i
detain
you
with
a
detail
of
the
trefors
de
denis
which
together
with
the
tombs
in
the
abbey
church
afforded
us
some
amusement
while
our
dinner
was
getting
ready
all
these
particulars
are
mentioned
in
twenty
different
books
of
tours
travels
and
directions
which
you
have
often
perused
i
shall
only
observe
that
the
abbey
church
is
the
lightest
piece
of
gothic
architecture
i
have
seen
and
the
air
within
seems
perfectly
free
from
that
damp
and
moisture
so
perceivable
in
all
our
old
cathedrals
this
must
be
owing
to
the
nature
of
its
situation
there
are
some
fine
marble
statues
that
adorn
the
tombs
of
certain
individuals
here
interred
but
they
are
mostly
in
the
french
taste
which
is
quite
contrary
to
the
simplicity
of
the
antients
their
attitudes
are
affected
unnatural
and
desultory
and
their
draperies
fantastic
or
as
one
of
our
english
artists
expressed
himself
they
are
all
of
a
flutter
as
for
the
treasures
which
are
shewn
on
certain
days
to
the
populace
gratis
they
are
contained
in
a
number
of
presses
or
armoires
and
if
the
stones
are
genuine
they
must
be
inestimable
but
this
i
can
not
believe
indeed
i
have
been
told
that
what
they
shew
as
diamonds
are
no
more
than
composition
nevertheless
exclusive
of
these
there
are
some
rough
stones
of
great
value
and
many
curiosities
worth
seeing
the
monk
that
shewed
them
was
the
very
image
of
our
friend
hamilton
both
in
his
looks
and
manner
i
have
one
thing
very
extraordinary
to
observe
of
the
french
auberges
which
seems
to
be
a
remarkable
deviation
from
the
general
character
of
the
nation
the
landlords
hostesses
and
servants
of
the
inns
upon
the
road
have
not
the
least
dash
of
complaisance
in
their
behaviour
to
strangers
instead
of
coming
to
the
door
to
receive
you
as
in
england
they
take
no
manner
of
notice
of
you
but
leave
you
to
find
or
enquire
your
way
into
the
kitchen
and
there
you
must
ask
several
times
for
a
chamber
before
they
seem
willing
to
conduct
you
up
stairs
in
general
you
are
served
with
the
appearance
of
the
most
mortifying
indifference
at
the
very
time
they
are
laying
schemes
for
fleecing
you
of
your
money
it
is
a
very
odd
contrast
between
france
and
england
in
the
former
all
the
people
are
complaisant
but
the
publicans
in
the
latter
there
is
hardly
any
complaisance
but
among
the
publicans
when
i
said
all
the
people
in
france
i
ought
also
to
except
those
vermin
who
examine
the
baggage
of
travellers
in
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
although
our
portmanteaus
were
sealed
with
lead
and
we
were
provided
with
a
from
the
douane
our
coach
was
searched
at
the
gate
of
paris
by
which
we
entered
and
the
women
were
obliged
to
get
out
and
stand
in
the
open
street
till
this
operation
was
performed
i
had
desired
a
friend
to
provide
lodgings
for
me
at
paris
in
the
fauxbourg
germain
and
accordingly
we
found
ourselves
accommodated
at
the
hotel
de
montmorency
with
a
first
floor
which
costs
me
ten
livres
a
day
i
should
have
put
up
with
it
had
it
been
less
polite
but
as
i
have
only
a
few
days
to
stay
in
this
place
and
some
visits
to
receive
i
am
not
sorry
that
my
friend
has
exceeded
his
commission
i
have
been
guilty
of
another
piece
of
extravagance
in
hiring
a
carosse
de
remise
for
which
i
pay
twelve
livres
a
day
besides
the
article
of
visiting
i
could
not
leave
paris
without
carrying
my
wife
and
the
girls
to
see
the
most
remarkable
places
in
and
about
this
capital
such
as
the
luxemburg
the
the
thuilleries
the
louvre
the
invalids
the
gobelins
together
with
versailles
trianon
marli
meudon
and
choissi
and
therefore
i
thought
the
difference
in
point
of
expence
would
not
be
great
between
a
carosse
de
remise
and
a
hackney
coach
the
first
are
extremely
elegant
if
not
too
much
ornamented
the
last
are
very
shabby
and
disagreeable
nothing
gives
me
such
chagrin
as
the
necessity
i
am
under
to
hire
a
valet
de
place
as
my
own
servant
does
not
speak
the
language
you
can
not
conceive
with
what
eagerness
and
dexterity
those
rascally
valets
exert
themselves
in
pillaging
strangers
there
is
always
one
ready
in
waiting
on
your
arrival
who
begins
by
assisting
your
own
servant
to
unload
your
baggage
and
interests
himself
in
your
affairs
with
such
artful
officiousness
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
shake
him
off
even
though
you
are
determined
beforehand
against
hiring
any
such
domestic
he
produces
recommendations
from
his
former
masters
and
the
people
of
the
house
vouch
for
his
honesty
the
truth
is
those
fellows
are
very
handy
useful
and
obliging
and
so
far
honest
that
they
will
not
steal
in
the
usual
way
you
may
safely
trust
one
of
them
to
bring
you
a
hundred
from
your
banker
but
they
fleece
you
without
mercy
in
every
other
article
of
expence
they
lay
all
your
tradesmen
under
contribution
your
taylor
barber
milliner
perfumer
mercer
jeweller
hatter
traiteur
and
even
the
bourgeois
who
owns
your
coach
pays
him
twenty
sols
per
day
his
wages
amount
to
twice
as
much
so
that
i
imagine
the
fellow
that
serves
me
makes
above
ten
shillings
a
day
besides
his
victuals
which
by
the
bye
he
has
no
right
to
demand
living
at
paris
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
is
very
near
twice
as
dear
as
it
was
fifteen
years
ago
and
indeed
this
is
the
case
in
london
a
circumstance
that
must
be
undoubtedly
owing
to
an
increase
of
taxes
for
i
do
find
that
in
the
articles
of
eating
and
drinking
the
french
people
are
more
luxurious
than
they
were
heretofore
i
am
told
the
entrees
or
duties
payed
upon
provision
imported
into
paris
are
very
heavy
all
manner
of
butcher
meat
and
poultry
are
extremely
good
in
this
place
the
beef
is
excellent
the
wine
which
is
generally
drank
is
a
very
thin
kind
of
burgundy
i
can
by
no
means
relish
their
cookery
but
one
breakfasts
deliciously
upon
their
petit
pains
and
their
pales
of
butter
which
last
is
exquisite
the
common
people
and
even
the
bourgeois
of
paris
live
at
this
season
chiefly
on
bread
and
grapes
which
is
undoubtedly
very
wholsome
fare
if
the
same
simplicity
of
diet
prevailed
in
england
we
should
certainly
undersell
the
french
at
all
foreign
markets
for
they
are
very
slothful
with
all
their
vivacity
and
the
great
number
of
their
holidays
not
only
encourages
this
lazy
disposition
but
actually
robs
them
of
one
half
of
what
their
labour
would
otherwise
produce
so
that
if
our
common
people
were
not
so
expensive
in
their
living
that
is
in
their
eating
and
drinking
labour
might
be
afforded
cheaper
in
england
than
in
france
there
are
three
young
lusty
hussies
nieces
or
daughters
of
a
blacksmith
that
lives
just
opposite
to
my
windows
who
do
nothing
from
morning
till
night
they
eat
grapes
and
bread
from
seven
till
nine
from
nine
till
twelve
they
dress
their
hair
and
are
all
the
afternoon
gaping
at
the
window
to
view
passengers
i
do
perceive
that
they
give
themselves
the
trouble
either
to
make
their
beds
or
clean
their
apartment
the
same
spirit
of
idleness
and
dissipation
i
have
observed
in
every
part
of
france
and
among
every
class
of
people
every
object
seems
to
have
shrunk
in
its
dimensions
since
i
was
last
in
paris
the
louvre
the
the
bridges
and
the
river
seine
by
no
means
answer
the
ideas
i
had
formed
of
them
from
my
former
observation
when
the
memory
is
not
very
correct
the
imagination
always
betrays
her
into
such
extravagances
when
i
first
revisited
my
own
country
after
an
absence
of
fifteen
years
i
found
every
thing
diminished
in
the
same
manner
and
i
could
scarce
believe
my
own
eyes
notwithstanding
the
gay
disposition
of
the
french
their
houses
are
all
gloomy
in
spite
of
all
the
ornaments
that
have
been
lavished
on
versailles
it
is
a
dismal
habitation
the
apartments
are
dark
dirty
and
unprincely
take
the
castle
chapel
and
garden
all
together
they
make
a
most
fantastic
composition
of
magnificence
and
littleness
taste
and
foppery
after
all
it
is
in
england
only
where
we
must
look
for
cheerful
apartments
gay
furniture
neatness
and
convenience
there
is
a
strange
incongruity
in
the
french
genius
with
all
their
volatility
prattle
and
fondness
for
bons
mots
they
delight
in
a
species
of
drawling
melancholy
church
music
their
most
favourite
dramatic
pieces
are
almost
without
incident
and
the
dialogue
of
their
comedies
consists
of
moral
insipid
apophthegms
intirely
destitute
of
wit
or
repartee
i
know
what
i
hazard
by
this
opinion
among
the
implicit
admirers
of
lully
racine
and
moliere
i
do
talk
of
the
busts
the
statues
and
pictures
which
abound
at
versailles
and
other
places
in
and
about
paris
particularly
the
great
collection
of
capital
pieces
in
the
belonging
to
the
duke
of
orleans
i
have
neither
capacity
nor
inclination
to
give
a
critique
on
these
chef
which
indeed
would
take
up
a
whole
volume
i
have
seen
this
great
magazine
of
painting
three
times
with
astonishment
but
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
if
there
had
not
been
half
the
number
one
is
bewildered
in
such
a
profusion
as
not
to
know
where
to
begin
and
hurried
away
before
there
is
time
to
consider
one
piece
with
any
sort
of
deliberation
besides
the
rooms
are
all
dark
and
a
great
many
of
the
pictures
hang
in
a
bad
light
as
for
trianon
marli
and
choissi
they
are
no
more
than
in
respect
to
palaces
and
notwithstanding
the
extravagant
eulogiums
which
you
have
heard
of
the
french
king
houses
i
will
venture
to
affirm
that
the
king
of
england
is
better
i
mean
more
comfortably
lodged
i
ought
however
to
except
fontainebleau
which
i
have
not
seen
the
city
of
paris
is
said
to
be
five
leagues
or
fifteen
miles
in
circumference
and
if
it
is
really
so
it
must
be
much
more
populous
than
london
for
the
streets
are
very
narrow
and
the
houses
very
high
with
a
different
family
on
every
floor
but
i
have
measured
the
best
plans
of
these
two
royal
cities
and
am
certain
that
paris
does
not
take
up
near
so
much
ground
as
london
and
westminster
occupy
and
i
suspect
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
is
also
exaggerated
by
those
who
say
it
amounts
to
eight
hundred
thousand
that
is
two
hundred
thousand
more
than
are
contained
in
the
bills
of
mortality
the
hotels
of
the
french
noblesse
at
paris
take
up
a
great
deal
of
room
with
their
courtyards
and
gardens
and
so
do
their
convents
and
churches
it
must
be
owned
indeed
that
their
streets
are
wonderfully
crouded
with
people
and
carriages
the
french
begin
to
imitate
the
english
but
only
in
such
particulars
as
render
them
worthy
of
imitation
when
i
was
last
at
paris
no
person
of
any
condition
male
or
female
appeared
but
in
full
dress
even
when
obliged
to
come
out
early
in
the
morning
and
there
was
not
such
a
thing
to
be
seen
as
a
perruque
ronde
but
at
present
i
see
a
number
of
frocks
and
scratches
in
a
morning
in
the
streets
of
this
metropolis
they
have
set
up
a
petite
poste
on
the
plan
of
our
with
some
improvements
and
i
am
told
there
is
a
scheme
on
foot
for
supplying
every
house
with
water
by
leaden
pipes
from
the
river
seine
they
have
even
adopted
our
practice
of
the
cold
bath
which
is
taken
very
conveniently
in
wooden
houses
erected
on
the
side
of
the
river
the
water
of
which
is
let
in
and
out
occasionally
by
cocks
fixed
in
the
sides
of
the
bath
there
are
different
rooms
for
the
different
sexes
the
accommodations
are
good
and
the
expence
is
a
trifle
the
tapestry
of
the
gobelins
is
brought
to
an
amazing
degree
of
perfection
and
i
am
surprised
that
this
furniture
is
not
more
in
fashion
among
the
great
who
alone
are
able
to
purchase
it
it
would
be
a
most
elegant
and
magnificent
ornament
which
would
always
nobly
distinguish
their
apartments
from
those
of
an
inferior
rank
and
in
this
they
would
run
no
risk
of
being
rivalled
by
the
bourgeois
at
the
village
of
chaillot
in
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
they
make
beautiful
carpets
and
and
this
is
the
more
extraordinary
as
there
are
hardly
any
carpets
used
in
this
kingdom
in
almost
all
the
the
floors
are
of
brick
and
have
no
other
kind
of
cleaning
than
that
of
being
sprinkled
with
water
and
swept
once
a
day
these
brick
floors
the
stone
stairs
the
want
of
wainscotting
in
the
rooms
and
the
thick
of
stone
are
however
good
preservatives
against
fire
which
seldom
does
any
damage
in
this
city
instead
of
wainscotting
the
walls
are
covered
with
tapestry
or
damask
the
beds
in
general
are
very
good
and
well
ornamented
with
testers
and
curtains
twenty
years
ago
the
river
seine
within
a
mile
of
paris
was
as
solitary
as
if
it
had
run
through
a
desert
at
present
the
banks
of
it
are
adorned
with
a
number
of
elegant
houses
and
plantations
as
far
as
marli
i
need
not
mention
the
machine
at
this
place
for
raising
water
because
i
know
you
are
well
acquainted
with
its
construction
nor
shall
i
say
any
thing
more
of
the
city
of
paris
but
that
there
is
a
new
square
built
upon
an
elegant
plan
at
the
end
of
the
garden
of
the
thuilleries
it
is
called
place
de
louis
xv
and
in
the
middle
of
it
there
is
a
good
equestrian
statue
of
the
reigning
king
you
have
often
heard
that
louis
xiv
frequently
regretted
that
his
country
did
not
afford
gravel
for
the
walks
of
his
gardens
which
are
covered
with
a
white
loose
sand
very
disagreeable
both
to
the
eyes
and
feet
of
those
who
walk
upon
it
but
this
is
a
vulgar
mistake
there
is
plenty
of
gravel
on
the
road
between
paris
and
versailles
as
well
as
in
many
other
parts
of
this
kingdom
but
the
french
who
are
all
for
glare
and
glitter
think
the
other
is
more
gay
and
agreeable
one
would
imagine
they
did
not
feel
the
burning
reflexion
from
the
white
sand
which
in
summer
is
almost
intolerable
in
the
character
of
the
french
considered
as
a
people
there
are
undoubtedly
many
circumstances
truly
ridiculous
you
know
the
fashionable
people
who
go
a
hunting
are
equipped
with
their
jack
boots
bag
wigs
swords
and
pistols
but
i
saw
the
other
day
a
scene
still
more
grotesque
on
the
road
to
choissi
a
fiacre
or
stopped
and
out
came
five
or
six
men
armed
with
musquets
who
took
post
each
behind
a
separate
tree
i
asked
our
servant
who
they
were
imagining
they
might
be
archers
or
footpads
of
justice
in
pursuit
of
some
malefactor
but
guess
my
surprise
when
the
fellow
told
me
they
were
gentlemen
a
la
chasse
they
were
in
fact
come
out
from
paris
in
this
equipage
to
take
the
diversion
of
that
is
of
shooting
from
behind
a
tree
at
the
hares
that
chanced
to
pass
indeed
if
they
had
nothing
more
in
view
but
to
destroy
the
game
this
was
a
very
effectual
method
for
the
hares
are
in
such
plenty
in
this
neighbourhood
that
i
have
seen
a
dozen
together
in
the
same
field
i
think
this
way
of
hunting
in
a
coach
or
chariot
might
be
properly
adopted
at
london
in
favour
of
those
aldermen
of
the
city
who
are
too
unwieldy
to
follow
the
hounds
a
horseback
the
french
however
with
all
their
absurdities
preserve
a
certain
ascendancy
over
us
which
is
very
disgraceful
to
our
nation
and
this
appears
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
article
of
dress
we
are
contented
to
be
thought
their
apes
in
fashion
but
in
fact
we
are
slaves
to
their
taylors
barbers
and
other
tradesmen
one
would
be
apt
to
imagine
that
our
own
tradesmen
had
joined
them
in
a
combination
against
us
when
the
natives
of
france
come
to
london
they
appear
in
all
public
places
with
cloaths
made
according
to
the
fashion
of
their
own
country
and
this
fashion
is
generally
admired
by
the
english
why
therefore
do
we
follow
it
implicitly
no
we
pique
ourselves
upon
a
most
ridiculous
deviation
from
the
very
modes
we
admire
and
please
ourselves
with
thinking
this
deviation
is
a
mark
of
our
spirit
and
liberty
but
we
have
not
spirit
enough
to
persist
in
this
deviation
when
we
visit
their
country
otherwise
perhaps
they
would
come
to
admire
and
follow
our
example
for
certainly
in
point
of
true
taste
the
fashions
of
both
countries
are
equally
absurd
at
present
the
skirts
of
the
english
descend
from
the
fifth
rib
to
the
calf
of
the
leg
and
give
the
coat
the
form
of
a
jewish
gaberdine
and
our
hats
seem
to
be
modelled
after
that
which
pistol
wears
upon
the
stage
in
france
the
haunch
buttons
and
pocketholes
are
within
half
a
foot
of
the
coat
extremity
their
hats
look
as
if
they
had
been
pared
round
the
brims
and
the
crown
is
covered
with
a
kind
of
cordage
which
in
my
opinion
produces
a
very
beggarly
effect
in
every
other
circumstance
of
dress
male
and
female
the
contrast
between
the
two
nations
appears
equally
glaring
what
is
the
consequence
when
an
englishman
comes
to
paris
he
can
not
appear
until
he
has
undergone
a
total
metamorphosis
at
his
first
arrival
he
finds
it
necessary
to
send
for
the
taylor
perruquier
hatter
shoemaker
and
every
other
tradesman
concerned
in
the
equipment
of
the
human
body
he
must
even
change
his
buckles
and
the
form
of
his
ruffles
and
though
at
the
risque
of
his
life
suit
his
cloaths
to
the
mode
of
the
season
for
example
though
the
weather
should
be
never
so
cold
he
must
wear
his
habit
or
without
presuming
to
put
on
a
warm
dress
before
the
day
which
fashion
has
fixed
for
that
purpose
and
neither
old
age
nor
infirmity
will
excuse
a
man
for
wearing
his
hat
upon
his
head
either
at
home
or
abroad
females
are
if
possible
still
more
subject
to
the
caprices
of
fashion
and
as
the
articles
of
their
dress
are
more
manifold
it
is
enough
to
make
a
man
heart
ake
to
see
his
wife
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
cotturieres
milliners
and
all
her
sacks
and
negligees
must
be
altered
and
new
trimmed
she
must
have
new
caps
new
laces
new
shoes
and
her
hair
new
cut
she
must
have
her
taffaties
for
the
summer
her
flowered
silks
for
the
spring
and
autumn
her
sattins
and
damasks
for
winter
the
good
man
who
used
to
wear
the
beau
drop
quite
plain
all
the
year
round
with
a
long
bob
or
tye
perriwig
must
here
provide
himself
with
a
camblet
suit
trimmed
with
silver
for
spring
and
autumn
with
silk
cloaths
for
summer
and
cloth
laced
with
gold
or
velvet
for
winter
and
he
must
wear
his
a
la
pigeon
this
variety
of
dress
is
absolutely
indispensible
for
all
those
who
pretend
to
any
rank
above
the
meer
bourgeois
on
his
return
to
his
own
country
all
this
frippery
is
useless
he
can
not
appear
in
london
until
he
has
undergone
another
thorough
metamorphosis
so
that
he
will
have
some
reason
to
think
that
the
tradesmen
of
paris
and
london
have
combined
to
lay
him
under
contribution
and
they
no
doubt
are
the
directors
who
regulate
the
fashions
in
both
capitals
the
english
however
in
a
subordinate
capacity
for
the
puppets
of
their
making
will
not
pass
at
paris
nor
indeed
in
any
other
part
of
europe
whereas
a
french
petit
maitre
is
reckoned
a
complete
figure
every
where
london
not
excepted
since
it
is
so
much
the
humour
of
the
english
at
present
to
run
abroad
i
wish
they
had
spirit
enough
to
produce
themselves
in
their
own
genuine
english
dress
and
treat
the
french
modes
with
the
same
philosophical
contempt
which
was
shewn
by
an
honest
gentleman
distinguished
by
the
name
of
that
unshaken
patriot
still
appears
in
the
same
kind
of
scratch
perriwig
hat
and
slit
sleeve
which
were
worn
years
ago
and
has
invariably
persisted
in
this
garb
in
defiance
of
all
the
revolutions
of
the
mode
i
remember
a
student
in
the
temple
who
after
a
long
and
learned
investigation
of
the
to
kalon
or
beautiful
had
resolution
enough
to
let
his
beard
grow
and
wore
it
in
all
public
places
until
his
heir
at
law
applied
for
a
commission
of
lunacy
against
him
then
he
submitted
to
the
razor
rather
than
run
any
risque
of
being
found
non
compos
before
i
conclude
i
must
tell
you
that
the
most
reputable
and
tradesmen
of
paris
think
it
no
disgrace
to
practise
the
most
shameful
imposition
i
myself
know
an
instance
of
one
of
the
most
creditable
marchands
in
this
capital
who
demanded
six
francs
an
ell
for
some
lutestring
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
at
the
same
time
and
declaring
en
conscience
that
it
had
cost
him
within
three
sols
of
the
money
yet
in
less
than
three
minutes
he
sold
it
for
four
and
a
half
and
when
the
buyer
upbraided
him
with
his
former
declaration
he
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
saying
il
faut
marchander
i
do
mention
this
as
a
particular
instance
the
same
mean
disingenuity
is
universal
all
over
france
as
i
have
been
informed
by
several
persons
of
veracity
the
next
letter
you
have
from
me
will
probably
be
dated
at
nismes
or
montpellier
i
am
ever
yours
letter
vii
to
m
paris
october
madam
i
shall
be
much
pleased
if
the
remarks
i
have
made
on
the
characters
of
the
french
people
can
afford
you
the
satisfaction
you
require
with
respect
to
the
ladies
i
can
only
judge
from
their
exteriors
but
indeed
these
are
so
characteristic
that
one
can
hardly
judge
amiss
unless
we
suppose
that
a
woman
of
taste
and
sentiment
may
be
so
overruled
by
the
absurdity
of
what
is
called
fashion
as
to
reject
reason
and
disguise
nature
in
order
to
become
ridiculous
or
frightful
that
this
may
be
the
case
with
some
individuals
is
very
possible
i
have
known
it
happen
in
our
own
country
where
the
follies
of
the
french
are
adopted
and
exhibited
in
the
most
aukward
imitation
but
the
general
prevalence
of
those
preposterous
modes
is
a
plain
proof
that
there
is
a
general
want
of
taste
and
a
general
depravity
of
nature
i
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
particulars
of
a
french
lady
dress
these
you
are
much
better
acquainted
with
than
i
can
pretend
to
be
but
this
i
will
be
bold
to
affirm
that
france
is
the
general
reservoir
from
which
all
the
absurdities
of
false
taste
luxury
and
extravagance
have
overflowed
the
different
kingdoms
and
states
of
europe
the
springs
that
fill
this
reservoir
are
no
other
than
vanity
and
ignorance
it
would
be
superfluous
to
attempt
proving
from
the
nature
of
things
from
the
first
principles
and
use
of
dress
as
well
as
from
the
consideration
of
natural
beauty
and
the
practice
of
the
ancients
who
certainly
understood
it
as
well
as
the
connoisseurs
of
these
days
that
nothing
can
be
more
monstrous
inconvenient
and
contemptible
than
the
fashion
of
modern
drapery
you
yourself
are
well
aware
of
all
its
defects
and
have
often
ridiculed
them
in
my
hearing
i
shall
only
mention
one
particular
of
dress
essential
to
the
fashion
in
this
country
which
seems
to
me
to
carry
human
affectation
to
the
very
farthest
verge
of
folly
and
extravagance
that
is
the
manner
in
which
the
faces
of
the
ladies
are
primed
and
painted
when
the
indian
chiefs
were
in
england
every
body
ridiculed
their
preposterous
method
of
painting
their
cheeks
and
but
this
ridicule
was
wrong
placed
those
critics
ought
to
have
considered
that
the
indians
do
not
use
paint
to
make
themselves
agreeable
but
in
order
to
be
the
more
terrible
to
their
enemies
it
is
generally
supposed
i
think
that
your
sex
make
use
of
fard
and
vermillion
for
very
different
purposes
namely
to
help
a
bad
or
faded
complexion
to
heighten
the
graces
or
conceal
the
defects
of
nature
as
well
as
the
ravages
of
time
i
shall
not
enquire
at
present
whether
it
is
just
and
honest
to
impose
in
this
manner
on
mankind
if
it
is
not
honest
it
may
be
allowed
to
be
artful
and
politic
and
shews
at
least
a
desire
of
being
agreeable
but
to
lay
it
on
as
the
fashion
in
france
prescribes
to
all
the
ladies
of
condition
who
indeed
can
not
appear
without
this
badge
of
distinction
is
to
disguise
themselves
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
them
odious
and
detestable
to
every
spectator
who
has
the
least
relish
left
for
nature
and
propriety
as
for
the
fard
or
white
with
which
their
necks
and
shoulders
are
plaistered
it
may
be
in
some
measure
excusable
as
their
skins
are
naturally
brown
or
sallow
but
the
rouge
which
is
daubed
on
their
faces
from
the
chin
up
to
the
eyes
without
the
least
art
or
dexterity
not
only
destroys
all
distinction
of
features
but
renders
the
aspect
really
frightful
or
at
best
conveys
nothing
but
ideas
of
disgust
and
aversion
you
know
that
without
this
horrible
masque
no
married
lady
is
admitted
at
court
or
in
any
polite
assembly
and
that
it
is
a
mark
of
distinction
which
no
bourgeoise
dare
assume
ladies
of
fashion
only
have
the
privilege
of
exposing
themselves
in
these
ungracious
colours
as
their
faces
are
concealed
under
a
false
complexion
so
their
heads
are
covered
with
a
vast
load
of
false
hair
which
is
frizzled
on
the
forehead
so
as
exactly
to
resemble
the
wooly
heads
of
the
guinea
negroes
as
to
the
natural
hue
of
it
this
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
for
powder
makes
every
head
of
hair
of
the
same
colour
and
no
woman
appears
in
this
country
from
the
moment
she
rises
till
night
without
being
compleatly
whitened
powder
or
meal
was
first
used
in
europe
by
the
poles
to
conceal
their
scald
heads
but
the
present
fashion
of
using
it
as
well
as
the
modish
method
of
dressing
the
hair
must
have
been
borrowed
from
the
hottentots
who
grease
their
wooly
heads
with
mutton
suet
and
then
paste
it
over
with
the
powder
called
buchu
in
like
manner
the
hair
of
our
fine
ladies
is
frizzled
into
the
appearance
of
negroes
wool
and
stiffened
with
an
abominable
paste
of
hog
grease
tallow
and
white
powder
the
present
fashion
therefore
of
painting
the
face
and
adorning
the
head
adopted
by
the
beau
monde
in
france
is
taken
from
those
two
polite
nations
the
chickesaws
of
america
and
the
hottentots
of
africa
on
the
whole
when
i
see
one
of
those
fine
creatures
sailing
along
in
her
taudry
robes
of
silk
and
gauze
frilled
and
flounced
and
furbelowed
with
her
false
locks
her
false
jewels
her
paint
her
patches
and
perfumes
i
can
not
help
looking
upon
her
as
the
vilest
piece
of
sophistication
that
art
ever
produced
this
hideous
masque
of
painting
though
destructive
of
all
beauty
is
however
favourable
to
natural
homeliness
and
deformity
it
accustoms
the
eyes
of
the
other
sex
and
in
time
reconciles
them
to
frightfull
objects
it
disables
them
from
perceiving
any
distinction
of
features
between
woman
and
woman
and
by
reducing
all
faces
to
a
level
gives
every
female
an
equal
chance
for
an
admirer
being
in
this
particular
analogous
to
the
practice
of
the
antient
lacedemonians
who
were
obliged
to
chuse
their
helpmates
in
the
dark
in
what
manner
the
insides
of
their
heads
are
furnished
i
would
not
presume
to
judge
from
the
conversation
of
a
very
few
to
whom
i
have
had
access
but
from
the
nature
of
their
education
which
i
have
heard
described
and
the
natural
vivacity
of
their
tempers
i
should
expect
neither
sense
sentiment
nor
discretion
from
the
nursery
they
are
allowed
and
even
encouraged
to
say
every
thing
that
comes
uppermost
by
which
means
they
acquire
a
volubility
of
tongue
and
a
set
of
phrases
which
constitutes
what
is
called
polite
conversation
at
the
same
time
they
obtain
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
sense
of
shame
or
rather
they
avoid
acquiring
this
troublesome
sensation
for
it
is
certainly
no
innate
idea
those
who
have
not
governesses
at
home
are
sent
for
a
few
years
to
a
convent
where
they
lay
in
a
fund
of
superstition
that
serves
them
for
life
but
i
never
heard
they
had
the
least
opportunity
of
cultivating
the
mind
of
exercising
the
powers
of
reason
or
of
imbibing
a
taste
for
letters
or
any
rational
or
useful
accomplishment
after
being
taught
to
prattle
to
dance
and
play
at
cards
they
are
deemed
sufficiently
qualified
to
appear
in
the
grand
monde
and
to
perform
all
the
duties
of
that
high
rank
and
station
in
life
in
mentioning
cards
i
ought
to
observe
that
they
learn
to
play
not
barely
for
amusement
but
also
with
a
view
to
advantage
and
indeed
you
seldom
meet
with
a
native
of
france
whether
male
or
female
who
is
not
a
compleat
gamester
well
versed
in
all
the
subtleties
and
finesses
of
the
art
this
is
likewise
the
case
all
over
italy
a
lady
of
a
great
house
in
piedmont
having
four
sons
makes
no
scruple
to
declare
that
the
first
shall
represent
the
family
the
second
enter
into
the
army
the
third
into
the
church
and
that
she
will
breed
the
fourth
a
gamester
these
noble
adventurers
devote
themselves
in
a
particular
manner
to
the
entertainment
of
travellers
from
our
country
because
the
english
are
supposed
to
be
full
of
money
rash
incautious
and
utterly
ignorant
of
play
but
such
a
sharper
is
most
dangerous
when
he
hunts
in
couple
with
a
female
i
have
known
a
french
count
and
his
wife
who
found
means
to
lay
the
most
wary
under
contribution
he
was
smooth
supple
officious
and
attentive
she
was
young
handsome
unprincipled
and
artful
if
the
englishman
marked
for
prey
was
found
upon
his
guard
against
the
designs
of
the
husband
then
madam
plied
him
on
the
side
of
gallantry
she
displayed
all
the
attractions
of
her
person
she
sung
danced
ogled
sighed
complimented
and
complained
if
he
was
insensible
to
all
her
charms
she
flattered
his
vanity
and
piqued
his
pride
by
extolling
the
wealth
and
generosity
of
the
english
and
if
he
proved
deaf
to
all
these
insinuations
she
as
her
last
stake
endeavoured
to
interest
his
humanity
and
compassion
she
expatiated
with
tears
in
her
eyes
on
the
cruelty
and
indifference
of
her
great
relations
represented
that
her
husband
was
no
more
than
the
cadet
of
a
noble
family
that
his
provision
was
by
no
means
suitable
either
to
the
dignity
of
his
rank
or
the
generosity
of
his
disposition
that
he
had
a
of
great
consequence
depending
which
had
drained
all
his
finances
and
finally
that
they
should
be
both
ruined
if
they
could
not
find
some
generous
friend
who
would
accommodate
them
with
a
sum
of
money
to
bring
the
cause
to
a
determination
those
who
are
not
actuated
by
such
scandalous
motives
become
gamesters
from
meer
habit
and
having
nothing
more
solid
to
engage
their
thoughts
or
employ
their
time
consume
the
best
part
of
their
lives
in
this
worst
of
all
dissipation
i
am
not
ignorant
that
there
are
exceptions
from
this
general
rule
i
know
that
france
has
produced
a
maintenon
a
sevigine
a
scuderi
a
dacier
and
a
chatelet
but
i
would
no
more
deduce
the
general
character
of
the
french
ladies
from
these
examples
than
i
would
call
a
field
of
hemp
a
because
there
might
be
in
it
a
few
lillies
or
renunculas
planted
by
the
hand
of
accident
woman
has
been
defined
a
weaker
man
but
in
this
country
the
men
are
in
my
opinion
more
ridiculous
and
insignificant
than
the
women
they
certainly
are
more
disagreeable
to
a
rational
enquirer
because
they
are
more
troublesome
of
all
the
coxcombs
on
the
face
of
the
earth
a
french
petit
maitre
is
the
most
impertinent
and
they
are
all
petit
maitres
from
the
marquis
who
glitters
in
lace
and
embroidery
to
the
garcon
barbier
covered
with
meal
who
struts
with
his
hair
in
a
long
queue
and
his
hat
under
his
arm
i
have
already
observed
that
vanity
is
the
great
and
universal
mover
among
all
ranks
and
degrees
of
people
in
this
nation
and
as
they
take
no
pains
to
conceal
or
controul
it
they
are
hurried
by
it
into
the
most
ridiculous
and
indeed
intolerable
extravagance
when
i
talk
of
the
french
nation
i
must
again
except
a
great
number
of
individuals
from
the
general
censure
though
i
have
a
hearty
contempt
for
the
ignorance
folly
and
presumption
which
characterise
the
generality
i
can
not
but
respect
the
talents
of
many
great
men
who
have
eminently
distinguished
themselves
in
every
art
and
science
these
i
shall
always
revere
and
esteem
as
creatures
of
a
superior
species
produced
for
the
wise
purposes
of
providence
among
the
refuse
of
mankind
it
would
be
absurd
to
conclude
that
the
welch
or
highlanders
are
a
gigantic
people
because
those
mountains
may
have
produced
a
few
individuals
near
seven
feet
high
it
would
be
equally
absurd
to
suppose
the
french
are
a
nation
of
philosophers
because
france
has
given
birth
to
a
des
cartes
a
maupertuis
a
reaumur
and
a
buffon
i
shall
not
even
deny
that
the
french
are
by
no
means
deficient
in
natural
capacity
but
they
are
at
the
same
time
remarkable
for
a
natural
levity
which
hinders
their
youth
from
cultivating
that
capacity
this
is
reinforced
by
the
most
preposterous
education
and
the
example
of
a
giddy
people
engaged
in
the
most
frivolous
pursuits
a
frenchman
is
by
some
jesuit
or
other
monk
taught
to
read
his
mother
tongue
and
to
say
his
prayers
in
a
language
he
does
not
understand
he
learns
to
dance
and
to
fence
by
the
masters
of
those
noble
sciences
he
becomes
a
compleat
connoisseur
in
dressing
hair
and
in
adorning
his
own
person
under
the
hands
and
instructions
of
his
barber
and
valet
de
chambre
if
he
learns
to
play
upon
the
flute
or
the
fiddle
he
is
altogether
irresistible
but
he
piques
himself
upon
being
polished
above
the
natives
of
any
other
country
by
his
conversation
with
the
fair
sex
in
the
course
of
this
communication
with
which
he
is
indulged
from
his
tender
years
he
learns
like
a
parrot
by
rote
the
whole
circle
of
french
compliments
which
you
know
are
a
set
of
phrases
ridiculous
even
to
a
proverb
and
these
he
throws
out
indiscriminately
to
all
women
without
distinction
in
the
exercise
of
that
kind
of
address
which
is
here
distinguished
by
the
name
of
gallantry
it
is
no
more
than
his
making
love
to
every
woman
who
will
give
him
the
hearing
it
is
an
exercise
by
the
repetition
of
which
he
becomes
very
pert
very
familiar
and
very
impertinent
modesty
or
diffidence
i
have
already
said
is
utterly
unknown
among
them
and
therefore
i
wonder
there
should
be
a
term
to
express
it
in
their
language
if
i
was
obliged
to
define
politeness
i
should
call
it
the
art
of
making
one
self
agreeable
i
think
it
an
art
that
necessarily
implies
a
sense
of
decorum
and
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
these
are
qualities
of
which
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
observe
a
frenchman
has
no
idea
therefore
he
never
can
be
deemed
polite
except
by
those
persons
among
whom
they
are
as
little
understood
his
first
aim
is
to
adorn
his
own
person
with
what
he
calls
fine
cloaths
that
is
the
frippery
of
the
fashion
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
heart
of
a
female
unimproved
by
reason
and
untinctured
with
natural
good
sense
should
flutter
at
the
sight
of
such
a
gaudy
thing
among
the
number
of
her
admirers
this
impression
is
enforced
by
fustian
compliments
which
her
own
vanity
interprets
in
a
literal
sense
and
still
more
confirmed
by
the
assiduous
attention
of
the
gallant
who
indeed
has
nothing
else
to
mind
a
frenchman
in
consequence
of
his
mingling
with
the
females
from
his
infancy
not
only
becomes
acquainted
with
all
their
customs
and
humours
but
grows
wonderfully
alert
in
performing
a
thousand
little
offices
which
are
overlooked
by
other
men
whose
time
hath
been
spent
in
making
more
valuable
acquisitions
he
enters
without
ceremony
a
lady
while
she
is
in
bed
reaches
her
whatever
she
wants
airs
her
shift
and
helps
to
put
it
on
he
attends
at
her
toilette
regulates
the
distribution
of
her
patches
and
advises
where
to
lay
on
the
paint
if
he
visits
her
when
she
is
dressed
and
perceives
the
least
impropriety
in
her
coeffure
he
insists
upon
adjusting
it
with
his
own
hands
if
he
sees
a
curl
or
even
a
single
hair
amiss
he
produces
his
comb
his
scissars
and
pomatum
and
sets
it
to
rights
with
the
dexterity
of
a
professed
friseur
he
her
to
every
place
she
visits
either
on
business
or
pleasure
and
by
dedicating
his
whole
time
to
her
renders
himself
necessary
to
her
occasions
this
i
take
to
be
the
most
agreeable
side
of
his
character
let
us
view
him
on
the
quarter
of
impertinence
a
frenchman
pries
into
all
your
secrets
with
the
most
impudent
and
importunate
curiosity
and
then
discloses
them
without
remorse
if
you
are
indisposed
he
questions
you
about
the
symptoms
of
your
disorder
with
more
freedom
than
your
physician
would
presume
to
use
very
often
in
the
grossest
terms
he
then
proposes
his
remedy
for
they
are
all
quacks
he
prepares
it
without
your
knowledge
and
worries
you
with
solicitation
to
take
it
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
the
opinion
of
those
whom
you
have
chosen
to
take
care
of
your
health
let
you
be
ever
so
ill
or
averse
to
company
he
forces
himself
at
all
times
into
your
and
if
it
is
necessary
to
give
him
a
peremptory
refusal
he
is
affronted
i
have
known
one
of
those
petit
maitres
insist
upon
paying
regular
visits
twice
a
day
to
a
poor
gentleman
who
was
delirious
and
he
conversed
with
him
on
different
subjects
till
he
was
in
his
last
agonies
this
attendance
is
not
the
effect
of
attachment
or
regard
but
of
sheer
vanity
that
he
may
afterwards
boast
of
his
charity
and
humane
disposition
though
of
all
the
people
i
have
ever
known
i
think
the
french
are
the
least
capable
of
feeling
for
the
distresses
of
their
fellow
creatures
their
hearts
are
not
susceptible
of
deep
impressions
and
such
is
their
levity
that
the
imagination
has
not
time
to
brood
long
over
any
disagreeable
idea
or
sensation
as
a
frenchman
piques
himself
on
his
gallantry
he
no
sooner
makes
a
conquest
of
a
female
heart
than
he
exposes
her
character
for
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
nay
if
he
should
miscarry
in
his
schemes
he
will
forge
letters
and
stories
to
the
ruin
of
the
reputation
this
is
a
species
of
perfidy
which
one
would
think
should
render
them
odious
and
detestable
to
the
whole
sex
but
the
case
is
otherwise
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
but
women
are
never
better
pleased
than
when
they
see
one
another
exposed
and
every
individual
has
such
confidence
in
her
own
superior
charms
and
discretion
that
she
thinks
she
can
fix
the
most
volatile
and
reform
the
most
treacherous
lover
if
a
frenchman
is
admitted
into
your
family
and
distinguished
by
repeated
marks
of
your
friendship
and
regard
the
first
return
he
makes
for
your
civilities
is
to
make
love
to
your
wife
if
she
is
handsome
if
not
to
your
sister
or
daughter
or
niece
if
he
suffers
a
repulse
from
your
wife
or
attempts
in
vain
to
debauch
your
sister
or
your
daughter
or
your
niece
he
will
rather
than
not
play
the
traitor
with
his
gallantry
make
his
addresses
to
your
grandmother
and
ten
to
one
but
in
one
shape
or
another
he
will
find
means
to
ruin
the
peace
of
a
family
in
which
he
has
been
so
kindly
entertained
what
he
can
not
accomplish
by
dint
of
compliment
and
personal
attendance
he
will
endeavour
to
effect
by
reinforcing
these
with
songs
and
verses
of
which
he
always
makes
a
provision
for
such
purposes
if
he
is
detected
in
these
efforts
of
treachery
and
reproached
with
his
ingratitude
he
impudently
declares
that
what
he
had
done
was
no
more
than
simple
gallantry
considered
in
france
as
an
indispensible
duty
on
every
man
who
pretended
to
good
breeding
nay
he
will
even
affirm
that
his
endeavours
to
corrupt
your
wife
or
your
daughter
were
the
most
genuine
proofs
he
could
give
of
his
particular
regard
for
your
family
if
a
frenchman
is
capable
of
real
friendship
it
must
certainly
be
the
most
disagreeable
present
he
can
possibly
make
to
a
man
of
a
true
english
character
you
know
madam
we
are
naturally
taciturn
soon
tired
of
impertinence
and
much
subject
to
fits
of
disgust
your
french
friend
intrudes
upon
you
at
all
hours
he
stuns
you
with
his
loquacity
he
teases
you
with
impertinent
questions
about
your
domestic
and
private
affairs
he
attempts
to
meddle
in
all
your
concerns
and
forces
his
advice
upon
you
with
the
most
unwearied
importunity
he
asks
the
price
of
every
thing
you
wear
and
so
sure
as
you
tell
him
undervalues
it
without
hesitation
he
affirms
it
is
in
a
bad
taste
that
you
have
been
imposed
upon
both
with
respect
to
the
fashion
and
the
price
that
the
marquise
of
this
or
the
countess
of
that
has
one
that
is
perfectly
elegant
quite
in
the
bon
ton
and
yet
it
cost
her
little
more
than
you
gave
for
a
thing
that
nobody
would
wear
if
there
were
five
hundred
dishes
at
table
a
frenchman
will
eat
of
all
of
them
and
then
complain
he
has
no
appetite
this
i
have
several
times
remarked
a
friend
of
mine
gained
a
considerable
wager
upon
an
experiment
of
this
kind
the
petit
maitre
ate
of
fourteen
different
plats
besides
the
dessert
then
disparaged
the
cook
declaring
he
was
no
better
than
a
marmiton
or
turnspit
the
french
have
the
most
ridiculous
fondness
for
their
hair
and
this
i
believe
they
inherit
from
their
remote
ancestors
the
first
race
of
french
kings
were
distinguished
by
their
long
hair
and
certainly
the
people
of
this
country
consider
it
as
an
indispensible
ornament
a
frenchman
will
sooner
part
with
his
religion
than
with
his
hair
which
indeed
no
consideration
will
induce
him
to
forego
i
know
a
gentleman
afflicted
with
a
continual
and
a
defluxion
on
his
eyes
who
was
told
by
his
physician
that
the
best
chance
he
had
for
being
cured
would
be
to
have
his
head
close
shaved
and
bathed
every
day
in
cold
water
how
cried
he
cut
my
hair
mr
doctor
your
most
humble
servant
he
dismissed
his
physician
lost
his
and
almost
his
senses
and
is
now
led
about
with
his
hair
in
a
bag
and
a
piece
of
green
silk
hanging
like
a
screen
before
his
face
count
saxe
and
other
military
writers
have
demonstrated
the
absurdity
of
a
soldier
wearing
a
long
head
of
hair
nevertheless
every
soldier
in
this
country
wears
a
long
queue
which
makes
a
delicate
mark
on
his
white
cloathing
and
this
ridiculous
foppery
has
descended
even
to
the
lowest
class
of
people
the
decrotteur
who
cleans
your
shoes
at
the
corner
of
the
pont
neuf
has
a
tail
of
this
kind
hanging
down
to
his
rump
and
even
the
peasant
who
drives
an
ass
loaded
with
dung
wears
his
hair
en
queue
though
perhaps
he
has
neither
shirt
nor
breeches
this
is
the
ornament
upon
which
he
bestows
much
time
and
pains
and
in
the
exhibition
of
which
he
finds
full
gratification
for
his
vanity
considering
the
harsh
features
of
the
common
people
in
this
country
their
diminutive
stature
their
grimaces
and
that
long
appendage
they
have
no
small
resemblance
to
large
baboons
walking
upright
and
perhaps
this
similitude
has
helped
to
entail
upon
them
the
ridicule
of
their
neighbours
a
french
friend
tires
out
your
patience
with
long
visits
and
far
from
taking
the
most
palpable
hints
to
withdraw
when
he
perceives
you
uneasy
he
observes
you
are
and
therefore
he
will
keep
you
company
this
perseverance
shews
that
he
must
either
be
void
of
penetration
or
that
his
disposition
must
be
truly
diabolical
rather
than
be
tormented
with
such
a
fiend
a
man
had
better
turn
him
out
of
doors
even
though
at
the
hazard
of
being
run
thro
the
body
the
french
are
generally
counted
insincere
and
taxed
with
want
of
generosity
but
i
think
these
reproaches
are
not
well
founded
professions
of
friendship
and
attachment
constitute
the
language
of
common
compliment
in
this
country
and
are
never
supposed
to
be
understood
in
the
literal
acceptation
of
the
words
and
if
their
acts
of
generosity
are
but
very
rare
we
ought
to
ascribe
that
rarity
not
so
much
to
a
deficiency
of
generous
sentiments
as
to
their
vanity
and
ostentation
which
engrossing
all
their
funds
utterly
disable
them
from
exerting
the
virtues
of
beneficence
vanity
indeed
predominates
among
all
ranks
to
such
a
degree
that
they
are
the
greatest
egotists
in
the
world
and
the
most
insignificant
individual
talks
in
company
with
the
same
conceit
and
arrogance
as
a
person
of
the
greatest
importance
neither
conscious
poverty
nor
disgrace
will
restrain
him
in
the
least
either
from
assuming
his
full
share
of
the
conversation
or
making
big
addresses
to
the
finest
lady
whom
he
has
the
smallest
opportunity
to
approach
nor
is
he
restrained
by
any
other
consideration
whatsoever
it
is
all
one
to
him
whether
he
himself
has
a
wife
of
his
own
or
the
lady
a
husband
whether
she
is
designed
for
the
cloister
or
to
his
best
friend
and
benefactor
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
his
addresses
can
not
but
be
acceptable
and
if
he
meets
with
a
repulse
he
condemns
her
taste
but
never
doubts
his
own
qualifications
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
say
of
their
military
character
and
their
punctilios
of
honour
which
last
are
equally
absurd
and
pernicious
but
as
this
letter
has
run
to
an
unconscionable
length
i
shall
defer
them
till
another
opportunity
i
have
the
honour
to
be
with
very
particular
esteem
madam
your
most
obedient
servant
letter
viii
to
m
lyons
october
dear
sir
i
was
favoured
with
yours
at
paris
and
look
upon
your
reproaches
as
the
proof
of
your
friendship
the
truth
is
i
considered
all
the
letters
i
have
hitherto
written
on
the
subject
of
my
travels
as
written
to
your
society
in
general
though
they
have
been
addressed
to
one
individual
of
it
and
if
they
contain
any
thing
that
can
either
amuse
or
inform
i
desire
that
henceforth
all
i
send
may
be
freely
perused
by
all
the
members
with
respect
to
my
health
about
which
you
so
kindly
enquire
i
have
nothing
new
to
communicate
i
had
reason
to
think
that
my
bathing
in
the
sea
at
boulogne
produced
a
good
effect
in
strengthening
my
relaxed
fibres
you
know
how
subject
i
was
to
colds
in
england
that
i
could
not
stir
abroad
after
nor
expose
myself
to
the
smallest
damp
nor
walk
till
the
least
moisture
appeared
on
my
skin
without
being
laid
up
for
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
at
paris
however
i
went
out
every
day
with
my
hat
under
my
arm
though
the
weather
was
wet
and
cold
i
walked
in
the
garden
at
versailles
even
after
it
was
dark
with
my
head
uncovered
on
a
cold
evening
when
the
ground
was
far
from
being
dry
nay
at
marli
i
sauntered
above
a
mile
through
damp
alleys
and
wet
grass
and
from
none
of
these
risques
did
i
feel
the
least
inconvenience
in
one
of
our
excursions
we
visited
the
manufacture
for
porcelain
which
the
king
of
france
has
established
at
the
village
of
st
cloud
on
the
road
to
versailles
and
which
is
indeed
a
noble
monument
of
his
munificence
it
is
a
very
large
building
both
commodious
and
magnificent
where
a
great
number
of
artists
are
employed
and
where
this
elegant
superfluity
is
carried
to
as
great
perfection
as
it
ever
was
at
dresden
yet
after
all
i
know
not
whether
the
porcelain
made
at
chelsea
may
not
vie
with
the
productions
either
of
dresden
or
st
cloud
if
it
falls
short
of
either
it
is
not
in
the
design
painting
enamel
or
other
ornaments
but
only
in
the
composition
of
the
metal
and
the
method
of
managing
it
in
the
furnace
our
porcelain
seems
to
be
a
partial
vitrification
of
levigated
flint
and
fine
pipe
clay
mixed
together
in
a
certain
proportion
and
if
the
pieces
are
not
removed
from
the
fire
in
the
very
critical
moment
they
will
be
either
too
little
or
too
much
vitrified
in
the
first
case
i
apprehend
they
will
not
acquire
a
proper
degree
of
cohesion
they
will
be
apt
to
be
corroded
discoloured
and
to
crumble
like
the
first
essays
that
were
made
at
chelsea
in
the
second
case
they
will
be
little
better
than
imperfect
glass
there
are
three
methods
of
travelling
from
paris
to
lyons
which
by
the
shortest
road
is
a
journey
of
about
three
hundred
and
sixty
miles
one
is
by
the
diligence
or
stagecoach
which
performs
it
in
five
days
and
every
passenger
pays
one
hundred
livres
in
consideration
of
which
he
not
only
has
a
seat
in
the
carriage
but
is
maintained
on
the
road
the
inconveniences
attending
this
way
of
travelling
are
these
you
are
crouded
into
the
carriage
to
the
number
of
eight
persons
so
as
to
sit
very
uneasy
and
sometimes
run
the
risque
of
being
stifled
among
very
indifferent
company
you
are
hurried
out
of
bed
at
four
three
nay
often
at
two
in
the
morning
you
are
obliged
to
eat
in
the
french
way
which
is
very
disagreeable
to
an
english
palate
and
at
chalons
you
must
embark
upon
the
saone
in
a
boat
which
conveys
you
to
lyons
so
that
the
two
last
days
of
your
journey
are
by
water
all
these
were
insurmountable
objections
to
me
who
am
in
such
a
bad
state
of
health
troubled
with
an
asthmatic
cough
spitting
slow
fever
and
restlessness
which
demands
a
continual
change
of
place
as
well
as
free
air
and
room
for
motion
i
was
this
day
visited
by
two
young
gentlemen
sons
of
guastaldi
late
minister
from
genoa
at
london
i
had
seen
them
at
paris
at
the
house
of
the
dutchess
of
douglas
they
came
hither
with
their
conductor
in
the
diligence
and
assured
me
that
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
than
their
situation
in
that
carriage
another
way
of
travelling
in
this
country
is
to
hire
a
coach
and
four
horses
and
this
method
i
was
inclined
to
take
but
when
i
went
to
the
bureau
where
alone
these
voitures
are
to
be
had
i
was
given
to
understand
that
it
would
cost
me
guineas
and
travel
so
slow
that
i
should
be
ten
days
upon
the
road
these
carriages
are
let
by
the
same
persons
who
farm
the
diligence
and
for
this
they
have
an
exclusive
privilege
which
makes
them
very
saucy
and
insolent
when
i
mentioned
my
servant
they
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
must
pay
two
more
for
his
seat
upon
the
coach
box
as
i
could
not
relish
these
terms
nor
brook
the
thoughts
of
being
so
long
upon
the
road
i
had
recourse
to
the
third
method
which
is
going
post
in
england
you
know
i
should
have
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
hire
a
couple
of
from
stage
to
stage
with
two
horses
in
each
but
here
the
case
is
quite
otherwise
the
post
is
farmed
from
the
king
who
lays
travellers
under
contribution
for
his
own
benefit
and
has
published
a
set
of
oppressive
ordonnances
which
no
stranger
nor
native
dares
transgress
the
postmaster
finds
nothing
but
horses
and
guides
the
carriage
you
yourself
must
provide
if
there
are
four
persons
within
the
carriage
you
are
obliged
to
have
six
horses
and
two
postillions
and
if
your
servant
sits
on
the
outside
either
before
or
behind
you
must
pay
for
a
seventh
you
pay
double
for
the
first
stage
from
paris
and
twice
double
for
passing
through
fontainbleau
when
the
court
is
there
as
well
as
at
coming
to
lyons
and
at
leaving
this
city
these
are
called
royal
posts
and
are
undoubtedly
a
scandalous
imposition
there
are
two
post
roads
from
paris
to
lyons
one
of
posts
by
the
way
of
moulins
the
other
of
by
the
way
of
dijon
in
burgundy
this
last
i
chose
partly
to
save
sixty
livres
and
partly
to
see
the
wine
harvest
of
burgundy
which
i
was
told
was
a
season
of
mirth
and
jollity
among
all
ranks
of
people
i
hired
a
very
good
coach
for
ten
to
lyons
and
set
out
from
paris
on
the
thirteenth
instant
with
six
horses
two
postillions
and
my
own
servant
on
horseback
we
made
no
stop
at
fontainbleau
though
the
court
was
there
but
lay
at
moret
which
is
one
stage
further
a
very
paltry
little
town
where
however
we
found
good
accommodation
i
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
castle
or
palace
of
fontainbleau
of
which
i
had
only
a
glimpse
in
passing
but
the
forest
in
the
middle
of
which
it
stands
is
a
noble
chace
of
great
extent
beautifully
wild
and
romantic
well
stored
with
game
of
all
sorts
and
abounding
with
excellent
timber
it
put
me
in
mind
of
the
new
forest
in
hampshire
but
the
hills
rocks
and
mountains
with
which
it
is
diversified
render
it
more
agreeable
the
people
of
this
country
dine
at
noon
and
travellers
always
find
an
ordinary
prepared
at
every
auberge
or
on
the
road
here
they
sit
down
promiscuously
and
dine
at
so
much
a
head
the
usual
price
is
thirty
sols
for
dinner
and
forty
for
supper
including
lodging
for
this
moderate
expence
they
have
two
courses
and
a
dessert
if
you
eat
in
your
own
apartment
you
pay
instead
of
forty
sols
three
and
in
some
places
four
livres
ahead
i
and
my
family
could
not
well
dispense
with
our
tea
and
toast
in
the
morning
and
had
no
stomach
to
eat
at
noon
for
my
own
part
i
hate
french
cookery
and
abominate
garlick
with
which
all
their
ragouts
in
this
part
of
the
country
are
highly
seasoned
we
therefore
formed
a
different
plan
of
living
upon
the
road
before
we
left
paris
we
laid
in
a
stock
of
tea
chocolate
cured
neats
tongues
and
saucissons
or
bologna
sausages
both
of
which
we
found
in
great
perfection
in
that
capital
where
indeed
there
are
excellent
provisions
of
all
sorts
about
ten
in
the
morning
we
stopped
to
breakfast
at
some
auberge
where
we
always
found
bread
butter
and
milk
in
the
mean
time
we
ordered
a
poulard
or
two
to
be
roasted
and
these
wrapped
in
a
napkin
were
put
into
the
boot
of
the
coach
together
with
bread
wine
and
water
about
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
while
the
horses
were
changing
we
laid
a
cloth
upon
our
knees
and
producing
our
store
with
a
few
earthen
plates
discussed
our
short
meal
without
further
ceremony
this
was
followed
by
a
dessert
of
grapes
and
other
fruit
which
we
had
also
provided
i
must
own
i
found
these
transient
refreshments
much
more
agreeable
than
any
regular
meal
i
ate
upon
the
road
the
wine
commonly
used
in
burgundy
is
so
weak
and
thin
that
you
would
not
drink
it
in
england
the
very
best
which
they
sell
at
dijon
the
capital
of
the
province
for
three
livres
a
bottle
is
in
strength
and
even
in
flavour
greatly
inferior
to
what
i
have
drank
in
london
i
believe
all
the
first
growth
is
either
consumed
in
the
houses
of
the
noblesse
or
sent
abroad
to
foreign
markets
i
have
drank
excellent
burgundy
at
brussels
for
a
florin
a
bottle
that
is
little
more
than
twenty
pence
sterling
the
country
from
the
forest
of
fontainbleau
to
the
lyonnois
through
which
we
passed
is
rather
agreeable
than
fertile
being
part
of
champagne
and
the
dutchy
of
burgundy
watered
by
three
pleasant
pastoral
rivers
the
seine
the
yonne
and
the
saone
the
flat
country
is
laid
out
chiefly
for
corn
but
produces
more
rye
than
wheat
almost
all
the
ground
seems
to
be
ploughed
up
so
that
there
is
little
or
nothing
lying
fallow
there
are
very
few
inclosures
scarce
any
meadow
ground
and
so
far
as
i
could
observe
a
great
scarcity
of
cattle
we
sometimes
found
it
very
difficult
to
procure
half
a
pint
of
milk
for
our
tea
in
burgundy
i
saw
a
peasant
ploughing
the
ground
with
a
a
lean
cow
and
a
yoked
together
it
is
generally
observed
that
a
great
number
of
black
cattle
are
bred
and
fed
on
the
mountains
of
burgundy
which
are
the
highest
lands
in
france
but
i
saw
very
few
the
peasants
in
france
are
so
wretchedly
poor
and
so
much
oppressed
by
their
landlords
that
they
can
not
afford
to
inclose
their
grounds
or
give
a
proper
respite
to
their
lands
or
to
stock
their
farms
with
a
sufficient
number
of
black
cattle
to
produce
the
necessary
manure
without
which
agriculture
can
never
be
carried
to
any
degree
of
perfection
indeed
whatever
efforts
a
few
individuals
may
make
for
the
benefit
of
their
own
estates
husbandry
in
france
will
never
be
generally
improved
until
the
farmer
is
free
and
independent
from
the
frequency
of
towns
and
villages
i
should
imagine
this
country
is
very
populous
yet
it
must
be
owned
that
the
towns
are
in
general
thinly
inhabited
i
saw
a
good
number
of
country
seats
and
plantations
near
the
banks
of
the
rivers
on
each
side
and
a
great
many
convents
sweetly
situated
on
rising
grounds
where
the
air
is
most
pure
and
the
prospect
most
agreeable
it
is
surprising
to
see
how
happy
the
founders
of
those
religious
houses
have
been
in
their
choice
of
situations
all
the
world
over
in
passing
through
this
country
i
was
very
much
struck
with
the
sight
of
large
ripe
clusters
of
grapes
entwined
with
the
briars
and
thorns
of
common
hedges
on
the
wayside
the
mountains
of
burgundy
are
covered
with
vines
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
and
seem
to
be
raised
by
nature
on
purpose
to
extend
the
surface
and
to
expose
it
the
more
advantageously
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
vandange
was
but
just
begun
and
the
people
were
employed
in
gathering
the
grapes
but
i
saw
no
signs
of
festivity
among
them
perhaps
their
joy
was
a
little
damped
by
the
bad
prospect
of
their
harvest
for
they
complained
that
the
weather
had
been
so
unfavourable
as
to
hinder
the
grapes
from
ripening
i
thought
indeed
there
was
something
uncomfortable
in
seeing
the
vintage
thus
retarded
till
the
beginning
of
winter
for
in
some
parts
i
found
the
weather
extremely
cold
particularly
at
a
place
called
where
we
lay
there
was
a
hard
frost
and
in
the
morning
the
pools
were
covered
with
a
thick
crust
of
ice
my
personal
adventures
on
the
road
were
such
as
will
not
bear
a
recital
they
consisted
of
petty
disputes
with
landladies
and
postillions
the
highways
seem
to
be
perfectly
safe
we
did
not
find
that
any
robberies
were
ever
committed
although
we
did
not
see
one
of
the
marechaussee
from
paris
to
lyons
you
know
the
marechaussee
are
a
body
of
troopers
well
mounted
maintained
in
france
as
to
the
public
roads
it
is
a
reproach
upon
england
that
some
such
patrol
is
not
appointed
for
the
protection
of
travellers
at
sens
in
champagne
my
servant
who
had
rode
on
before
to
bespeak
fresh
horses
told
me
that
the
domestic
of
another
company
had
been
provided
before
him
altho
it
was
not
his
turn
as
he
had
arrived
later
at
the
post
provoked
at
this
partiality
i
resolved
to
chide
the
and
accordingly
addressed
myself
to
a
person
who
stood
at
the
door
of
the
auberge
he
was
a
jolly
figure
fat
and
fair
dressed
in
an
odd
kind
of
garb
with
a
gold
laced
cap
on
his
head
and
a
cambric
handkerchief
pinned
to
his
middle
the
sight
of
such
a
fantastic
petit
maitre
in
the
character
of
a
increased
my
spleen
i
called
to
him
with
an
air
of
authority
mixed
with
indignation
and
when
he
came
up
to
the
coach
asked
in
a
peremptory
tone
if
he
did
not
understand
the
king
ordonnance
concerning
the
regulation
of
the
posts
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
but
before
he
could
make
any
answer
i
pulled
out
the
and
began
to
read
with
great
vociferation
the
article
which
orders
that
the
traveller
who
comes
first
shall
be
first
served
by
this
time
the
fresh
horses
being
put
to
the
carriage
and
the
postillions
mounted
the
coach
set
off
all
of
a
sudden
with
uncommon
speed
i
imagined
the
had
given
the
fellows
a
signal
to
be
gone
and
in
this
persuasion
thrusting
my
head
out
at
the
window
i
bestowed
some
epithets
upon
him
which
must
have
sounded
very
harsh
in
the
ears
of
a
frenchman
we
stopped
for
a
refreshment
at
a
little
town
called
where
by
the
bye
i
was
scandalously
imposed
upon
and
even
abused
by
a
virago
of
a
landlady
then
proceeding
to
the
next
stage
i
was
given
to
understand
we
could
not
be
supplied
with
fresh
horses
here
i
perceived
at
the
door
of
the
inn
the
same
person
whom
i
had
reproached
at
sens
he
came
up
to
the
coach
and
told
me
that
notwithstanding
what
the
guides
had
said
i
should
have
fresh
horses
in
a
few
minutes
i
imagined
he
was
master
both
of
this
house
and
the
auberge
at
sens
between
which
he
passed
and
repassed
occasionally
and
that
he
was
now
desirous
of
making
me
amends
for
the
affront
he
had
put
upon
me
at
the
other
place
observing
that
one
of
the
trunks
behind
was
a
little
displaced
he
assisted
my
servant
in
adjusting
it
then
he
entered
into
conversation
with
me
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
in
a
which
we
had
passed
was
an
english
gentleman
on
his
return
from
italy
i
wanted
to
know
who
he
was
and
when
he
said
he
could
not
tell
i
asked
him
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
why
he
had
not
enquired
of
his
servant
he
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
retired
to
the
inn
door
having
waited
about
half
an
hour
i
beckoned
to
him
and
when
he
approached
upbraided
him
with
having
told
me
that
i
should
be
supplied
with
fresh
horses
in
a
few
minutes
he
seemed
shocked
and
answered
that
he
thought
he
had
reason
for
what
he
said
observing
that
it
was
as
disagreeable
to
him
as
to
me
to
wait
for
a
relay
as
it
began
to
rain
i
pulled
up
the
glass
in
his
face
and
he
withdrew
again
to
the
door
seemingly
ruffled
at
my
deportment
in
a
little
time
the
horses
arrived
and
three
of
them
were
immediately
put
to
a
very
handsome
into
which
he
stepped
and
set
out
accompanied
by
a
man
in
a
rich
livery
on
horseback
astonished
at
this
circumstance
i
asked
the
hostler
who
he
was
and
he
replied
that
he
was
a
man
of
fashion
un
seigneur
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
auxerre
i
was
much
mortified
to
find
that
i
had
treated
a
nobleman
so
scurvily
and
scolded
my
own
people
for
not
having
more
penetration
than
myself
i
dare
say
he
did
not
fail
to
descant
upon
the
brutal
behaviour
of
the
englishman
and
that
my
mistake
served
with
him
to
confirm
the
national
reproach
of
bluntness
and
ill
breeding
under
which
we
lie
in
this
country
the
truth
is
i
was
that
day
more
than
usually
peevish
from
the
bad
weather
as
well
as
from
the
dread
of
a
fit
of
the
asthma
with
which
i
was
threatened
and
i
dare
say
my
appearance
seemed
as
uncouth
to
him
as
his
travelling
dress
appeared
to
me
i
had
a
grey
mourning
frock
under
a
wide
great
coat
a
bob
wig
without
powder
a
very
large
laced
hat
and
a
meagre
wrinkled
discontented
countenance
the
fourth
night
of
our
journey
we
lay
at
macon
and
the
next
day
passed
through
the
lyonnois
which
is
a
fine
country
full
of
towns
villages
and
gentlemen
houses
in
passing
through
the
maconnois
we
saw
a
great
many
fields
of
indian
corn
which
grows
to
the
height
of
six
or
seven
feet
it
is
made
into
flour
for
the
use
of
the
common
people
and
goes
by
the
name
of
turkey
wheat
here
likewise
as
well
as
in
dauphine
they
raise
a
vast
quantity
of
very
large
pompions
with
the
contents
of
which
they
thicken
their
soup
and
ragouts
as
we
travelled
only
while
the
sun
was
up
on
account
of
my
ill
health
and
the
post
horses
in
france
are
in
bad
order
we
seldom
exceeded
twenty
leagues
a
day
i
was
directed
to
a
at
lyons
which
being
full
they
shewed
us
to
a
tavern
where
i
was
led
up
three
pair
of
stairs
to
an
apartment
consisting
of
three
paltry
chambers
for
which
the
people
demanded
twelve
livres
a
day
for
dinner
and
supper
they
asked
besides
three
livres
for
my
servant
so
that
my
daily
expence
would
have
amounted
to
about
livres
exclusive
of
breakfast
and
coffee
in
the
afternoon
i
was
so
provoked
at
this
extortion
that
without
answering
one
word
i
drove
to
another
auberge
where
i
now
am
and
pay
at
the
rate
of
livres
a
day
for
which
i
am
very
badly
lodged
and
but
very
indifferently
entertained
i
mention
these
circumstances
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
imposition
to
which
strangers
are
subject
in
this
country
it
must
be
owned
however
that
in
the
article
of
eating
i
might
save
half
the
money
by
going
to
the
public
ordinary
but
this
is
a
scheme
of
oeconomy
which
exclusive
of
other
disagreeable
circumstances
neither
my
own
health
nor
that
of
my
wife
permits
me
to
embrace
my
journey
from
paris
to
lyons
including
the
hire
of
the
coach
and
all
expences
on
the
road
has
cost
me
within
a
few
shillings
forty
from
paris
our
baggage
though
not
plombe
was
not
once
examined
till
we
arrived
in
this
city
at
the
gate
of
which
we
were
questioned
by
one
of
the
searchers
who
being
tipt
with
half
a
crown
allowed
us
to
proceed
without
further
enquiry
i
purposed
to
stay
in
lyons
until
i
should
receive
some
letters
i
expected
from
london
to
be
forwarded
by
my
banker
at
paris
but
the
enormous
expence
of
living
in
this
manner
has
determined
me
to
set
out
in
a
day
or
two
for
montpellier
although
that
place
is
a
good
way
out
of
the
road
to
nice
my
reasons
for
taking
that
route
i
shall
communicate
in
my
next
i
am
ever
dear
sir
your
affectionate
and
obliged
humble
servant
letter
ix
montpellier
november
dear
sir
the
city
of
lyons
has
been
so
often
and
so
circumstantially
described
that
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
any
thing
new
on
the
subject
indeed
i
know
very
little
of
it
but
what
i
have
read
in
books
as
i
had
but
one
day
to
make
a
tour
of
the
streets
squares
and
other
remarkable
places
the
bridge
over
the
rhone
seems
to
be
so
slightly
built
that
i
should
imagine
it
would
be
one
day
carried
away
by
that
rapid
river
especially
as
the
arches
are
so
small
that
after
great
rains
they
are
sometimes
bouchees
or
stopped
up
that
is
they
do
not
admit
a
sufficient
passage
for
the
encreased
body
of
the
water
in
order
to
remedy
this
dangerous
defect
in
some
measure
they
found
an
artist
some
years
ago
who
has
removed
a
middle
pier
and
thrown
two
arches
into
one
this
alteration
they
looked
upon
as
a
masterpiece
in
architecture
though
there
is
many
a
common
mason
in
england
who
would
have
undertaken
and
performed
the
work
without
valuing
himself
much
upon
the
enterprize
this
bridge
as
well
as
that
of
esprit
is
built
not
in
a
strait
line
across
the
river
but
with
a
curve
which
forms
a
convexity
to
oppose
the
current
such
a
bend
is
certainly
calculated
for
the
better
resisting
the
general
impetuosity
of
the
stream
and
has
no
bad
effect
to
the
eye
lyons
is
a
great
populous
and
flourishing
city
but
i
am
surprised
to
find
it
is
counted
a
healthy
place
and
that
the
air
of
it
is
esteemed
favourable
to
pulmonic
disorders
it
is
situated
on
the
confluence
of
two
large
rivers
from
which
there
must
be
a
great
evaporation
as
well
as
from
the
low
marshy
grounds
which
these
rivers
often
overflow
this
must
render
the
air
moist
frouzy
and
even
putrid
if
it
was
not
well
ventilated
by
winds
from
the
mountains
of
swisserland
and
in
the
latter
end
of
autumn
it
must
be
subject
to
fogs
the
morning
we
set
out
from
thence
the
whole
city
and
adjacent
plains
were
covered
with
so
thick
a
fog
that
we
could
not
distinguish
from
the
coach
the
head
of
the
foremost
mule
that
drew
it
lyons
is
said
to
be
very
hot
in
summer
and
very
cold
in
winter
therefore
i
imagine
must
abound
with
inflammatory
and
intermittent
disorders
in
the
spring
and
fall
of
the
year
my
reasons
for
going
to
montpellier
which
is
out
of
the
strait
road
to
nice
were
these
having
no
acquaintance
nor
correspondents
in
the
south
of
france
i
had
desired
my
credit
might
be
sent
to
the
same
house
to
which
my
heavy
baggage
was
consigned
i
expected
to
find
my
baggage
at
cette
which
is
the
of
montpellier
and
there
i
also
hoped
to
find
a
vessel
in
which
i
might
be
transported
by
sea
to
nice
without
further
trouble
i
longed
to
try
what
effect
the
boasted
air
of
montpellier
would
have
upon
my
constitution
and
i
had
a
great
desire
to
see
the
famous
monuments
of
antiquity
in
and
about
the
ancient
city
of
nismes
which
is
about
eight
leagues
short
of
montpellier
at
the
inn
where
we
lodged
i
found
a
return
berline
belonging
to
avignon
with
three
mules
which
are
the
animals
commonly
used
for
carriages
in
this
country
this
i
hired
for
five
the
coach
was
large
commodious
and
the
mules
were
strong
and
in
good
order
and
the
driver
whose
name
was
joseph
appeared
to
be
a
sober
sagacious
intelligent
fellow
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
every
place
in
the
south
of
france
he
told
me
he
was
owner
of
the
coach
but
i
afterwards
learned
he
was
no
other
than
a
hired
servant
i
likewise
detected
him
in
some
knavery
in
the
course
of
our
journey
and
plainly
perceived
he
had
a
with
the
on
the
road
but
in
other
respects
he
was
very
obliging
serviceable
and
even
entertaining
there
are
some
knavish
practices
of
this
kind
at
which
a
traveller
will
do
well
to
shut
his
eyes
for
his
own
ease
and
convenience
he
will
be
lucky
if
he
has
to
do
with
a
sensible
knave
like
joseph
who
understood
his
interest
too
well
to
be
guilty
of
very
flagrant
pieces
of
imposition
a
man
impatient
to
be
at
his
journey
end
will
find
this
a
most
disagreeable
way
of
travelling
in
summer
it
must
be
quite
intolerable
the
mules
are
very
sure
but
very
slow
the
journey
seldom
exceeds
eight
leagues
about
four
and
twenty
miles
a
day
and
as
those
people
have
certain
fixed
stages
you
are
sometimes
obliged
to
rise
in
a
morning
before
day
a
circumstance
very
grievous
to
persons
in
ill
health
these
inconveniences
however
were
by
other
agreemens
we
no
sooner
quitted
lyons
than
we
got
into
summer
weather
and
travelling
through
a
most
romantic
country
along
the
banks
of
the
rhone
had
opportunities
from
the
slowness
of
our
pace
to
contemplate
its
beauties
at
leisure
the
rapidity
of
the
rhone
is
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
its
being
confined
within
steep
banks
on
each
side
these
are
formed
almost
through
its
whole
course
by
a
double
chain
of
mountains
which
rise
with
all
abrupt
ascent
from
both
banks
of
the
river
the
mountains
are
covered
with
vineyards
interspersed
with
small
and
in
many
places
they
are
crowned
with
churches
chapels
and
convents
which
add
greatly
to
the
romantic
beauty
of
the
prospect
the
highroad
as
far
as
avignon
lies
along
the
side
of
the
river
which
runs
almost
in
a
straight
line
and
affords
great
convenience
for
inland
commerce
travellers
bound
to
the
southern
parts
of
france
generally
embark
in
the
diligence
at
lyons
and
glide
down
this
river
with
great
velocity
passing
a
great
number
of
towns
and
villages
on
each
side
where
they
find
ordinaries
every
day
at
dinner
and
supper
in
good
weather
there
is
no
danger
in
this
method
of
travelling
you
come
to
the
pont
esprit
where
the
stream
runs
through
the
arches
with
such
rapidity
that
the
boat
is
sometimes
overset
but
those
passengers
who
are
under
any
apprehension
are
landed
and
taken
in
again
after
the
boat
has
passed
just
in
the
same
manner
as
at
london
bridge
the
boats
that
go
up
the
river
are
drawn
against
the
stream
by
oxen
which
swim
through
one
of
the
arches
of
this
bridge
the
driver
sitting
between
the
horns
of
the
foremost
beast
we
set
out
from
lyons
early
on
monday
morning
and
as
a
robbery
had
been
a
few
days
before
committed
in
that
neighbourhood
i
ordered
my
servant
to
load
my
musquetoon
with
a
charge
of
eight
balls
by
the
bye
this
piece
did
not
fail
to
attract
the
curiosity
and
admiration
of
the
people
in
every
place
through
which
we
passed
the
carriage
no
sooner
halted
than
a
crowd
immediately
surrounded
the
man
to
view
the
blunderbuss
which
they
dignified
with
the
title
of
petit
canon
at
nuys
in
burgundy
he
fired
it
in
the
air
and
the
whole
mob
dispersed
and
scampered
off
like
a
flock
of
sheep
in
our
journey
hither
we
generally
set
out
in
a
morning
at
eight
and
travelled
noon
when
the
mules
were
put
up
and
rested
a
couple
of
hours
during
this
halt
joseph
went
to
dinner
and
we
went
to
breakfast
after
which
we
ordered
provision
for
our
refreshment
in
the
coach
which
we
took
about
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
halting
for
that
purpose
by
the
side
of
some
transparent
brook
which
afforded
excellent
water
to
mix
with
our
wine
in
this
country
i
was
almost
poisoned
with
garlic
which
they
mix
in
their
ragouts
and
all
their
sauces
nay
the
smell
of
it
perfumes
the
very
chambers
as
well
as
every
person
you
approach
i
was
also
very
sick
of
been
ficas
grives
or
thrushes
and
other
little
birds
which
are
served
up
twice
a
day
at
all
ordinaries
on
the
road
they
make
their
appearance
in
and
are
always
half
raw
in
which
condition
the
french
choose
to
eat
them
rather
than
run
the
risque
of
losing
the
juice
by
the
peasants
on
the
south
of
france
are
poorly
clad
and
look
as
if
they
were
diminutive
swarthy
and
meagre
and
yet
the
common
people
who
travel
live
luxuriously
on
the
road
every
carrier
and
has
two
meals
a
day
consisting
each
of
a
couple
of
courses
and
a
dessert
with
tolerable
small
wine
that
which
is
called
hermitage
and
grows
in
this
province
of
dauphine
is
sold
on
the
spot
for
three
livres
a
bottle
the
common
draught
which
you
have
at
meals
in
this
country
is
remarkably
strong
though
in
flavour
much
inferior
to
that
of
burgundy
the
accommodation
is
tolerable
though
they
demand
even
in
this
cheap
country
the
exorbitant
price
of
four
livres
a
head
for
every
meal
of
those
who
choose
to
eat
in
their
own
apartments
i
insisted
however
upon
paying
them
with
three
which
they
received
though
not
without
murmuring
and
seeming
discontented
in
this
journey
we
found
plenty
of
good
mutton
pork
poultry
and
game
including
the
red
partridge
which
is
near
twice
as
big
as
the
partridge
of
england
their
hares
are
likewise
surprisingly
large
and
juicy
we
saw
great
flocks
of
black
turkeys
feeding
in
the
fields
but
no
black
cattle
and
milk
was
so
scarce
that
sometimes
we
were
obliged
to
drink
our
tea
without
it
one
day
perceiving
a
meadow
on
the
side
of
the
road
full
of
a
flower
which
i
took
to
be
the
crocus
i
desired
my
servant
to
alight
and
pull
some
of
them
he
delivered
the
musquetoon
to
joseph
who
began
to
tamper
with
it
and
off
it
went
with
a
prodigious
report
augmented
by
an
eccho
from
the
mountains
that
skirted
the
road
the
mules
were
so
frightened
that
they
went
off
at
the
gallop
and
joseph
for
some
minutes
could
neither
manage
the
reins
nor
open
his
mouth
at
length
he
recollected
himself
and
the
cattle
were
stopt
by
the
assistance
of
the
servant
to
whom
he
delivered
the
musquetoon
with
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
then
alighting
from
the
box
he
examined
the
heads
of
his
three
mules
and
kissed
each
of
them
in
his
turn
finding
they
had
received
no
damage
he
came
up
to
the
coach
with
a
pale
visage
and
staring
eyes
and
said
it
was
god
mercy
he
had
not
killed
his
beasts
i
answered
that
it
was
a
greater
mercy
he
had
not
killed
his
passengers
for
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
might
have
been
directed
our
way
as
well
as
any
other
and
in
that
case
joseph
might
have
been
hanged
for
murder
i
had
as
good
be
hanged
said
he
for
murder
as
be
ruined
by
the
loss
of
my
cattle
this
adventure
made
such
an
impression
upon
him
that
he
recounted
it
to
every
person
we
met
nor
would
he
ever
touch
the
blunderbuss
from
that
day
i
was
often
diverted
with
the
conversation
of
this
fellow
who
was
very
arch
and
very
communicative
every
afternoon
he
used
to
stand
upon
the
at
the
side
of
the
coach
and
discourse
with
us
an
hour
together
passing
by
the
gibbet
of
valencia
which
stands
very
near
the
we
saw
one
body
hanging
quite
naked
and
another
lying
broken
on
the
wheel
i
recollected
that
mandrin
had
suffered
in
this
place
and
calling
to
joseph
to
mount
the
asked
if
he
had
ever
seen
that
famous
adventurer
at
mention
of
the
name
of
mandrin
the
tear
started
in
joseph
eye
he
discharged
a
deep
sigh
or
rather
groan
and
told
me
he
was
his
dear
friend
i
was
a
little
startled
at
this
declaration
however
i
concealed
my
thoughts
and
began
to
ask
questions
about
the
character
and
exploits
of
a
man
who
had
made
such
noise
in
the
world
he
told
me
mandrin
was
a
native
of
valencia
of
mean
extraction
that
he
had
served
as
a
soldier
in
the
army
and
afterwards
acted
as
maltotier
or
that
at
length
he
turned
contrebandier
or
smuggler
and
by
his
superior
qualities
raised
himself
to
the
command
of
a
formidable
gang
consisting
of
five
hundred
persons
well
armed
with
carbines
and
pistols
he
had
fifty
horses
for
his
troopers
and
three
hundred
mules
for
the
carriage
of
his
merchandize
his
were
in
savoy
but
he
made
incursions
into
dauphine
and
set
the
marechaussee
at
defiance
he
maintained
several
bloody
skirmishes
with
these
troopers
as
well
as
with
other
regular
detachments
and
in
all
those
actions
signalized
himself
by
his
courage
and
conduct
coming
up
at
one
time
with
fifty
of
the
marechaussee
who
were
in
quest
of
him
he
told
them
very
calmly
he
had
occasion
for
their
horses
and
acoutrements
and
desired
them
to
dismount
at
that
instant
his
gang
appeared
and
the
troopers
complied
with
his
request
without
making
the
least
opposition
joseph
said
he
was
as
generous
as
he
was
brave
and
never
molested
travellers
nor
did
the
least
injury
to
the
poor
but
on
the
contrary
relieved
them
very
often
he
used
to
oblige
the
gentlemen
in
the
country
to
take
his
merchandize
his
tobacco
brandy
and
muslins
at
his
own
price
and
in
the
same
manner
he
laid
the
open
towns
under
contribution
when
he
had
no
merchandize
he
borrowed
money
off
them
upon
the
credit
of
what
he
should
bring
when
he
was
better
provided
he
was
at
last
betrayed
by
his
wench
to
the
colonel
of
a
french
regiment
who
went
with
a
detachment
in
the
night
to
the
place
where
he
lay
in
savoy
and
surprized
him
in
a
while
his
people
were
absent
in
different
parts
of
the
country
for
this
intrusion
the
court
of
france
made
an
apology
to
the
king
of
sardinia
in
whose
territories
he
was
taken
mandrin
being
conveyed
to
valencia
his
native
place
was
for
some
time
permitted
to
go
abroad
under
a
strong
guard
with
chains
upon
his
legs
and
here
he
conversed
freely
with
all
sorts
of
people
flattering
himself
with
the
hopes
of
a
pardon
in
which
however
he
was
disappointed
an
order
came
from
court
to
bring
him
to
his
trial
when
he
was
found
guilty
and
condemned
to
be
broke
on
the
wheel
joseph
said
he
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
with
him
the
night
before
his
execution
he
bore
his
fate
with
great
resolution
observing
that
if
the
letter
which
he
had
written
to
the
king
had
been
delivered
he
certainly
should
have
obtained
his
majesty
pardon
his
executioner
was
one
of
his
own
gang
who
was
pardoned
on
condition
of
performing
this
office
you
know
that
criminals
broke
upon
the
wheel
are
first
strangled
unless
the
sentence
imports
that
they
shall
be
broke
alive
as
mandrin
had
not
been
guilty
of
cruelty
in
the
course
of
his
delinquency
he
was
indulged
with
this
favour
speaking
to
the
executioner
whom
he
had
formerly
commanded
joseph
dit
il
je
ne
veux
pas
que
tu
me
touche
ce
que
je
sois
roid
mort
joseph
said
he
thou
shalt
not
touch
me
till
i
am
quite
dead
our
driver
had
no
sooner
pronounced
these
words
than
i
was
struck
with
a
suspicion
that
he
himself
was
the
executioner
of
his
friend
mandrin
on
that
suspicion
i
exclaimed
ah
ah
joseph
the
fellow
blushed
up
to
the
eyes
and
said
oui
son
nom
etoit
joseph
aussi
bien
que
le
mien
yes
he
was
called
joseph
as
i
am
i
did
not
think
proper
to
prosecute
the
inquiry
but
did
not
much
relish
the
nature
of
connexions
the
truth
is
he
had
very
much
the
looks
of
a
ruffian
though
i
must
own
his
behaviour
was
very
obliging
and
submissive
on
the
fifth
day
of
our
journey
in
the
morning
we
passed
the
famous
bridge
at
esprit
which
to
be
sure
is
a
great
curiosity
from
its
length
and
the
number
of
its
arches
but
these
arches
are
too
small
the
passage
above
is
too
narrow
and
the
whole
appears
to
be
too
slight
considering
the
force
and
impetuosity
of
the
river
it
is
not
comparable
to
the
bridge
at
westminster
either
for
beauty
or
solidity
here
we
entered
languedoc
and
were
stopped
to
have
our
baggage
examined
but
the
searcher
being
tipped
with
a
piece
allowed
it
to
pass
before
we
leave
dauphine
i
must
observe
that
i
was
not
a
little
surprized
to
see
figs
and
chestnuts
growing
in
the
open
fields
at
the
discretion
of
every
passenger
it
was
this
day
i
saw
the
famous
pont
du
garde
but
as
i
can
not
possibly
include
in
this
letter
a
description
of
that
beautiful
bridge
and
of
the
other
antiquities
belonging
to
nismes
i
will
defer
it
till
the
next
opportunity
being
in
the
mean
time
with
equal
truth
and
affection
dear
sir
your
obliged
humble
servant
letter
x
montpellier
november
dear
sir
by
the
pont
esprit
we
entered
the
province
of
languedoc
and
breakfasted
at
bagniole
which
is
a
little
paltry
town
from
whence
however
there
is
an
excellent
road
through
a
mountain
made
at
a
great
expence
and
extending
about
four
leagues
about
five
in
the
afternoon
i
had
the
first
glimpse
of
the
famous
pont
du
garde
which
stands
on
the
right
hand
about
the
distance
of
a
league
from
the
to
nismes
and
about
three
leagues
from
that
city
i
would
not
willingly
pass
for
a
false
enthusiast
in
taste
but
i
can
not
help
observing
that
from
the
first
distant
view
of
this
noble
monument
till
we
came
near
enough
to
see
it
perfectly
i
felt
the
strongest
emotions
of
impatience
that
i
had
ever
known
and
obliged
our
driver
to
put
his
mules
to
the
full
gallop
in
the
apprehension
that
it
would
be
dark
before
we
reached
the
place
i
expected
to
find
the
building
in
some
measure
ruinous
but
was
agreeably
disappointed
to
see
it
look
as
fresh
as
the
bridge
at
westminster
the
climate
is
either
so
pure
and
dry
or
the
with
which
it
is
built
so
hard
that
the
very
angles
of
them
remain
as
acute
as
if
they
had
been
cut
last
year
indeed
some
large
stones
have
dropped
out
of
the
arches
but
the
whole
is
admirably
preserved
and
presents
the
eye
with
a
piece
of
architecture
so
unaffectedly
elegant
so
simple
and
majestic
that
i
will
defy
the
most
phlegmatic
and
stupid
spectator
to
behold
it
without
admiration
it
was
raised
in
the
augustan
age
by
the
roman
colony
of
nismes
to
convey
a
stream
of
water
between
two
mountains
for
the
use
of
that
city
it
stands
over
the
river
gardon
which
is
a
beautiful
pastoral
stream
brawling
among
rocks
which
form
a
number
of
pretty
natural
cascades
and
overshadowed
on
each
side
with
trees
and
shrubs
which
greatly
add
to
the
rural
beauties
of
the
scene
it
rises
in
the
cevennes
and
the
sand
of
it
produces
gold
as
we
learn
from
reaumur
in
his
essay
on
this
subject
inserted
in
the
french
memoirs
for
the
year
if
i
lived
at
nismes
or
avignon
which
last
city
is
within
four
short
leagues
of
it
i
should
take
pleasure
in
forming
parties
to
come
hither
in
summer
to
dine
under
one
of
the
arches
of
the
pont
du
garde
on
a
cold
collation
this
work
consists
of
three
bridges
or
tire
of
arches
one
above
another
the
first
of
six
the
second
of
eleven
and
the
third
of
the
height
comprehending
the
aqueduct
on
the
top
amounts
to
feet
three
inches
the
length
between
the
two
mountains
which
it
unites
extends
to
the
order
of
architecture
is
the
tuscan
but
the
symmetry
of
it
is
inconceivable
by
scooping
the
bases
of
the
pilasters
of
the
second
tire
of
arches
they
had
made
a
passage
for
but
though
the
antients
far
excelled
us
in
beauty
they
certainly
fell
short
of
the
moderns
in
point
of
conveniency
the
citizens
of
avignon
have
in
this
particular
improved
the
roman
work
with
a
new
bridge
by
apposition
constructed
on
the
same
plan
with
that
of
the
lower
tire
of
arches
of
which
indeed
it
seems
to
be
a
part
affording
a
broad
and
commodious
passage
over
the
river
to
horses
and
carriages
of
all
kinds
the
aqueduct
for
the
continuance
of
which
this
superb
work
was
raised
conveyed
a
stream
of
sweet
water
from
the
fountain
of
eure
near
the
city
of
uzes
and
extended
near
six
leagues
in
length
in
approaching
nismes
you
see
the
ruins
of
a
roman
tower
built
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
which
the
city
it
seems
to
have
been
intended
at
first
as
a
watch
or
though
in
the
sequel
it
was
used
as
a
fortress
what
remains
of
it
is
about
ninety
feet
high
the
architecture
of
the
doric
order
i
no
sooner
alighted
at
the
inn
than
i
was
presented
with
a
pamphlet
containing
an
account
of
nismes
and
its
antiquities
which
every
stranger
buys
there
are
persons
too
who
attend
in
order
to
shew
the
town
and
you
will
always
be
accosted
by
some
shabby
antiquarian
who
presents
you
with
medals
for
sale
assuring
you
they
are
genuine
antiques
and
were
dug
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
roman
temple
and
baths
all
those
fellows
are
cheats
and
they
have
often
laid
under
contribution
raw
english
travellers
who
had
more
money
than
discretion
to
such
they
sell
the
vilest
and
most
common
trash
but
when
they
meet
with
a
connoisseur
they
produce
some
medals
which
are
really
valuable
and
curious
nismes
antiently
called
nemausis
was
originally
a
colony
of
romans
settled
by
augustus
caesar
after
the
battle
of
actium
it
is
still
of
considerable
extent
and
said
to
contain
twelve
thousand
families
but
the
number
seems
by
this
account
to
be
greatly
exaggerated
certain
it
is
the
city
must
have
been
formerly
very
extensive
as
appears
from
the
circuit
of
the
antient
walls
the
remains
of
which
are
still
to
be
seen
its
present
size
is
not
one
third
of
its
former
extent
its
temples
baths
statues
towers
basilica
and
amphitheatre
prove
it
to
have
been
a
city
of
great
opulence
and
magnificence
at
present
the
remains
of
these
antiquities
are
all
that
make
it
respectable
or
remarkable
though
here
are
manufactures
of
silk
and
wool
carried
on
with
good
success
the
water
necessary
for
these
works
is
supplied
by
a
source
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
upon
which
the
tower
is
placed
and
here
were
discovered
the
ruins
of
roman
baths
which
had
been
formed
and
adorned
with
equal
taste
and
magnificence
among
the
rubbish
they
found
a
vast
profusion
of
columns
vases
capitals
cornices
inscriptions
medals
statues
and
among
other
things
the
finger
of
a
colossal
statue
in
bronze
which
according
to
the
rules
of
proportion
must
have
been
fifteen
feet
high
from
these
particulars
it
appears
that
the
edifices
must
have
been
spacious
and
magnificent
part
of
a
tesselated
pavement
still
remains
the
antient
pavement
of
the
bath
is
still
intire
all
the
rubbish
has
been
cleared
away
and
the
baths
in
a
great
measure
restored
on
the
old
plan
though
they
are
not
at
present
used
for
any
thing
but
ornament
the
water
is
collected
into
two
vast
reservoirs
and
a
canal
built
and
lined
with
hewn
stone
there
are
three
handsome
bridges
thrown
over
this
vast
canal
it
contains
a
great
body
of
excellent
water
which
by
pipes
and
other
small
branching
canals
traverses
the
town
and
is
converted
to
many
different
purposes
of
oeconomy
and
manufacture
between
the
roman
bath
and
these
great
canals
the
ground
is
agreeably
laid
out
in
for
the
recreation
of
the
inhabitants
here
are
likewise
ornaments
of
architecture
which
savour
much
more
of
french
foppery
than
of
the
simplicity
and
greatness
of
the
antients
it
is
very
surprizing
that
this
fountain
should
produce
such
a
great
body
of
water
as
fills
the
basin
of
the
source
the
roman
basin
two
large
deep
canals
three
hundred
feet
in
length
two
vast
basins
that
make
part
of
the
great
canal
which
is
eighteen
hundred
feet
long
eighteen
feet
deep
and
feet
broad
when
i
saw
it
there
was
in
it
about
eight
or
nine
feet
of
water
transparent
as
crystal
it
must
be
observed
however
for
the
honour
of
french
cleanliness
that
in
the
roman
basin
through
which
this
noble
stream
of
water
passes
i
perceived
two
washerwomen
at
work
upon
children
clouts
and
dirty
linnen
surprized
and
much
disgusted
at
this
filthy
phaenomenon
i
asked
by
what
means
and
by
whose
permission
those
dirty
hags
had
got
down
into
the
basin
in
order
to
contaminate
the
water
at
its
and
understood
they
belonged
to
the
commandant
of
the
place
who
had
keys
of
the
subterranean
passage
fronting
the
roman
baths
are
the
ruins
of
an
antient
temple
which
according
to
tradition
was
dedicated
to
diana
but
it
has
been
observed
by
connoisseurs
that
all
the
antient
temples
of
this
goddess
were
of
the
ionic
order
whereas
this
is
partly
corinthian
and
partly
composite
it
is
about
seventy
foot
long
and
six
and
thirty
in
breadth
arched
above
and
built
of
large
blocks
of
stone
exactly
joined
together
without
any
cement
the
walls
are
still
standing
with
three
great
tabernacles
at
the
further
end
fronting
the
entrance
on
each
side
there
are
niches
in
the
intercolumniation
of
the
walls
together
with
pedestals
and
shafts
of
pillars
cornices
and
an
entablature
which
indicate
the
former
magnificence
of
the
building
it
was
destroyed
during
the
civil
war
that
raged
in
the
reign
of
henry
iii
of
france
it
is
amazing
that
the
successive
irruptions
of
barbarous
nations
of
goths
vandals
and
moors
of
fanatic
croisards
still
more
sanguinary
and
illiberal
than
those
barbarians
should
have
spared
this
temple
as
well
as
two
other
still
more
noble
monuments
of
architecture
that
to
this
day
adorn
the
city
of
nismes
i
mean
the
amphitheatre
and
the
edifice
called
maison
carree
the
former
of
these
is
counted
the
finest
monument
of
the
kind
now
extant
and
was
built
in
the
reign
of
antoninus
pius
who
contributed
a
large
sum
of
money
towards
its
erection
it
is
of
an
oval
figure
one
thousand
and
eighty
feet
in
circumference
capacious
enough
to
hold
twenty
thousand
spectators
the
architecture
is
of
the
tuscan
order
sixty
feet
high
composed
of
two
open
galleries
built
one
over
another
consisting
each
of
threescore
arcades
the
entrance
into
the
arena
was
by
four
great
gates
with
porticos
and
the
seats
of
which
there
were
thirty
rising
one
above
another
consisted
of
great
blocks
of
stone
many
of
which
still
remain
over
the
north
gate
appear
two
bulls
in
extremely
well
executed
emblems
which
according
to
the
custom
of
the
romans
signified
that
the
amphitheatre
was
erected
at
the
expence
of
the
people
there
are
in
other
parts
of
it
some
work
in
and
heads
or
busts
but
indifferently
carved
it
stands
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
and
strikes
the
spectator
with
awe
and
veneration
the
external
architecture
is
almost
intire
in
its
whole
circuit
but
the
arena
is
filled
up
with
houses
this
amphitheatre
was
fortified
as
a
citadel
by
the
visigoths
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
they
raised
within
it
a
castle
two
towers
of
which
are
still
extant
and
they
surrounded
it
with
a
broad
and
deep
fossee
which
was
filled
up
in
the
thirteenth
century
in
all
the
subsequent
wars
to
which
this
city
was
exposed
it
served
as
the
last
resort
of
the
citizens
and
sustained
a
great
number
of
successive
attacks
so
that
its
preservation
is
almost
miraculous
it
is
likely
however
to
suffer
much
more
from
the
gothic
avarice
of
its
own
citizens
some
of
whom
are
mutilating
it
every
day
for
the
sake
of
the
stones
which
they
employ
in
their
own
private
buildings
it
is
surprizing
that
the
authority
has
not
been
exerted
to
put
an
end
to
such
sacrilegious
violation
if
the
amphitheatre
strikes
you
with
an
idea
of
greatness
the
maison
carree
enchants
you
with
the
most
exquisite
beauties
of
architecture
and
sculpture
this
is
an
edifice
supposed
formerly
to
have
been
erected
by
adrian
who
actually
built
a
basilica
in
this
city
though
no
vestiges
of
it
remain
but
the
following
inscription
which
was
discovered
on
the
front
of
it
plainly
proves
that
it
was
built
by
the
inhabitants
of
nismes
in
honour
of
caius
and
lucius
caesar
the
grandchildren
of
augustus
by
his
daughter

to

consuls
elect
princes
of
the
roman
youth
this
beautiful
edifice
which
stands
upon
a
pediment
six
feet
high
is
feet
long
broad
and
high
without
reckoning
the
pediment
the
body
of
it
is
adorned
with
twenty
columns
engaged
in
the
wall
and
the
peristyle
which
is
open
with
ten
detached
pillars
that
support
the
entablature
they
are
all
of
the
corinthian
order
fluted
and
embellished
with
capitals
of
the
most
exquisite
sculpture
the
frize
and
cornice
are
much
admired
and
the
foliage
is
esteemed
inimitable
the
proportions
of
the
building
are
so
happily
united
as
to
give
it
an
air
of
majesty
and
grandeur
which
the
most
indifferent
spectator
can
not
behold
without
emotion
a
man
needs
not
be
a
connoisseur
in
architecture
to
enjoy
these
beauties
they
are
indeed
so
exquisite
that
you
may
return
to
them
every
day
with
a
fresh
appetite
for
seven
years
together
what
renders
them
the
more
curious
they
are
still
entire
and
very
little
affected
either
by
the
ravages
of
time
or
the
havoc
of
war
cardinal
alberoni
declared
that
it
was
a
jewel
that
deserved
a
cover
of
gold
to
preserve
it
from
external
injuries
an
italian
painter
perceiving
a
small
part
of
the
roof
repaired
by
modern
french
masonry
tore
his
hair
and
exclaimed
in
a
rage
zounds
what
do
i
see
harlequin
hat
on
the
head
of
augustus
without
all
doubt
it
is
ravishingly
beautiful
the
whole
world
can
not
parallel
it
and
i
am
astonished
to
see
it
standing
entire
like
the
effects
of
inchantment
after
such
a
succession
of
ages
every
one
more
barbarous
than
another
the
history
of
the
antiquities
of
nismes
takes
notice
of
a
grotesque
statue
representing
two
female
bodies
and
legs
united
under
the
head
of
an
old
man
but
as
it
does
not
inform
us
where
it
is
kept
i
did
not
see
it
the
whole
country
of
languedoc
is
shaded
with
olive
trees
the
fruit
of
which
begins
to
ripen
and
appears
as
black
as
sloes
those
they
pickle
are
pulled
green
and
steeped
for
some
time
in
a
lye
made
of
quick
lime
or
wood
ashes
which
extracts
the
bitter
taste
and
makes
the
fruit
tender
without
this
preparation
it
is
not
eatable
under
the
olive
and
fig
trees
they
plant
corn
and
vines
so
that
there
is
not
an
inch
of
ground
unlaboured
but
here
are
no
open
fields
meadows
or
cattle
to
be
seen
the
ground
is
overloaded
and
the
produce
of
it
crowded
to
such
a
degree
as
to
have
a
bad
effect
upon
the
eye
impressing
the
traveller
with
the
ideas
of
indigence
and
rapacity
the
heat
in
summer
is
so
excessive
that
cattle
would
find
no
green
forage
every
blade
of
grass
being
parched
up
and
destroyed
the
weather
was
extremely
hot
when
we
entered
montpellier
and
put
up
at
the
cheval
blanc
counted
the
best
auberge
in
the
place
tho
in
fact
it
is
a
most
wretched
hovel
the
habitation
of
darkness
dirt
and
imposition
here
i
was
obliged
to
pay
four
livres
a
meal
for
every
person
in
my
family
and
two
livres
at
night
for
every
bed
though
all
in
the
same
room
one
would
imagine
that
the
further
we
advance
to
the
southward
the
living
is
the
dearer
though
in
fact
every
article
of
housekeeping
is
cheaper
in
languedoc
than
many
other
provinces
of
france
this
imposition
is
owing
to
the
concourse
of
english
who
come
hither
and
like
simple
birds
of
passage
allow
themselves
to
be
plucked
by
the
people
of
the
country
who
know
their
weak
side
and
make
their
attacks
accordingly
they
affect
to
believe
that
all
the
travellers
of
our
country
are
grand
seigneurs
immensely
rich
and
incredibly
generous
and
we
are
silly
enough
to
encourage
this
opinion
by
submitting
quietly
to
the
most
ridiculous
extortion
as
well
as
by
committing
acts
of
the
most
absurd
extravagance
this
folly
of
the
english
together
with
a
concourse
of
people
from
different
quarters
who
come
hither
for
the
of
their
health
has
rendered
montpellier
one
of
the
dearest
places
in
the
south
of
france
the
city
which
is
but
small
stands
upon
a
rising
ground
fronting
the
mediterranean
which
is
about
three
leagues
to
the
southward
on
the
other
side
is
an
agreeable
plain
extending
about
the
same
distance
towards
the
mountains
of
the
cevennes
the
town
is
reckoned
well
built
and
what
the
french
call
bien
percee
yet
the
streets
are
in
general
narrow
and
the
houses
dark
the
air
is
counted
salutary
in
catarrhous
consumptions
from
its
dryness
and
elasticity
but
too
sharp
in
cases
of
pulmonary
imposthumes
it
was
at
montpellier
that
we
saw
for
the
first
time
any
signs
of
that
gaiety
and
mirth
for
which
the
people
of
this
country
are
celebrated
in
all
other
places
through
which
we
passed
since
our
departure
from
lyons
we
saw
nothing
but
marks
of
poverty
and
chagrin
we
entered
montpellier
on
a
sunday
when
the
people
were
all
dressed
in
their
best
apparel
the
streets
were
crowded
and
a
great
number
of
the
better
sort
of
both
sexes
sat
upon
stone
seats
at
their
doors
conversing
with
great
mirth
and
familiarity
these
conversations
lasted
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
and
many
of
them
were
improved
with
musick
both
vocal
and
instrumental
next
day
we
were
visited
by
the
english
residing
in
the
place
who
always
pay
this
mark
of
respect
to
new
comers
they
consist
of
four
or
five
families
among
whom
i
could
pass
the
winter
very
agreeably
if
the
state
of
my
health
and
other
reasons
did
not
call
me
away
l
had
arrived
two
days
before
me
troubled
with
the
same
asthmatic
disorder
under
which
i
have
laboured
so
long
he
told
me
he
had
been
in
quest
of
me
ever
since
he
left
england
upon
comparing
notes
i
found
he
had
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
country
inn
in
picardy
and
drank
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
while
i
was
at
dinner
up
stairs
nay
he
had
even
spoke
to
my
servant
and
asked
who
was
his
master
and
the
man
not
knowing
him
replied
he
was
a
gentleman
from
chelsea
he
had
walked
by
the
door
of
the
house
where
i
lodged
at
paris
twenty
times
while
i
was
in
that
city
and
the
very
day
before
he
arrived
at
montpellier
he
had
passed
our
coach
on
the
road
the
garrison
of
this
city
consists
of
two
battalions
one
of
which
is
the
irish
regiment
of
berwick
commanded
by
lieutenant
colonel
tents
a
gentleman
with
whom
we
contracted
an
acquaintance
at
boulogne
he
treats
us
with
great
politeness
and
indeed
does
every
thing
in
his
power
to
make
the
place
agreeable
to
us
the
duke
of
the
governor
is
expected
here
in
a
little
time
we
have
already
a
tolerable
concert
twice
a
week
there
will
be
a
comedy
in
the
winter
and
the
states
of
provence
assemble
in
january
so
that
montpellier
will
be
extremely
gay
and
brilliant
these
very
circumstances
would
determine
me
to
leave
it
i
have
not
health
to
enjoy
these
pleasures
i
can
not
bear
a
croud
of
company
such
as
pours
in
upon
us
unexpectedly
at
all
hours
and
i
foresee
that
in
staying
at
montpellier
i
should
be
led
into
an
expence
which
i
can
ill
afford
i
have
therefore
forwarded
the
letter
i
received
from
general
p
n
to
b
d
our
consul
at
nice
signifying
my
intention
of
going
thither
and
explaining
the
kind
of
accommodation
i
would
choose
to
have
at
that
place
the
day
after
our
arrival
i
procured
tolerable
lodgings
in
the
high
street
for
which
i
pay
fifty
sols
something
more
than
two
shillings
per
day
and
i
am
furnished
with
two
meals
a
day
by
a
traiteur
for
ten
livres
but
he
finds
neither
the
wine
nor
the
dessert
and
indeed
we
are
but
indifferently
served
those
families
who
reside
here
find
their
account
in
keeping
house
every
traveller
who
comes
to
this
or
any
other
town
in
france
with
a
design
to
stay
longer
than
a
day
or
two
ought
to
write
beforehand
to
his
correspondent
to
procure
furnished
lodgings
to
which
he
may
be
driven
immediately
without
being
under
the
necessity
of
lying
in
an
execrable
inn
for
all
the
inns
of
this
country
are
execrable
my
baggage
is
not
yet
arrived
by
the
canal
of
languedoc
but
that
gives
me
no
disturbance
as
it
is
consigned
to
the
care
of
ray
an
english
merchant
and
banker
of
this
place
a
gentleman
of
great
probity
and
worth
from
whom
i
have
received
repeated
marks
of
uncommon
friendship
and
hospitality
the
next
time
you
hear
of
me
will
be
from
nice
i
remain
always
dear
sir
your
affectionate
humble
servant
letter
xi
montpellier
november
dear
doctor
i
flattered
myself
with
the
hope
of
much
amusement
during
my
short
stay
at
the
university
the
botanical
garden
the
state
of
physic
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
the
information
i
received
of
a
curious
collection
of
manuscripts
among
which
i
hoped
to
find
something
for
our
friend
h
r
all
these
particulars
promised
a
rich
fund
of
entertainment
which
however
i
can
not
enjoy
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
it
began
to
rain
with
a
southerly
wind
and
continued
without
ceasing
the
best
part
of
a
week
leaving
the
air
so
loaded
with
vapours
that
there
was
no
walking
after
without
being
wetted
by
the
dew
almost
to
the
skin
i
have
always
found
a
cold
and
damp
atmosphere
the
most
unfavourable
of
any
to
my
constitution
my
asthmatical
disorder
which
had
not
given
me
much
disturbance
since
i
left
boulogne
became
now
very
troublesome
attended
with
fever
cough
spitting
and
lowness
of
spirits
and
i
wasted
visibly
every
day
i
was
favoured
with
the
advice
of
fitzmaurice
a
very
worthy
sensible
physician
settled
in
this
place
but
i
had
the
curiosity
to
know
the
opinion
of
the
celebrated
professor
f
who
is
the
boerhaave
of
montpellier
the
account
i
had
of
his
private
character
and
personal
deportment
from
some
english
people
to
whom
he
was
well
known
left
me
no
desire
to
converse
with
him
but
i
resolved
to
consult
with
him
on
paper
this
great
lanthorn
of
medicine
is
become
very
rich
and
very
insolent
and
in
proportion
as
his
wealth
increases
he
is
said
to
grow
the
more
rapacious
he
piques
himself
upon
being
very
slovenly
very
blunt
and
very
unmannerly
and
perhaps
to
these
qualifications
be
owes
his
reputation
rather
than
to
any
superior
skill
in
medicine
i
have
known
them
succeed
in
our
own
country
and
seen
a
doctor
parts
estimated
by
his
brutality
and
presumption
f
is
in
his
person
and
address
not
unlike
our
old
acquaintance
sm
ie
he
stoops
much
dodges
along
and
affects
to
speak
the
patois
which
is
a
corruption
of
the
old
provencial
tongue
spoken
by
the
vulgar
in
languedoc
and
provence
notwithstanding
his
great
age
and
great
wealth
he
will
still
scramble
up
two
pair
of
stairs
for
a
fee
of
six
livres
and
without
a
fee
he
will
give
his
advice
to
no
person
whatsoever
he
is
said
to
have
great
practice
in
the
venereal
branch
and
to
be
frequented
by
persons
of
both
sexes
infected
with
this
distemper
not
only
from
every
part
of
france
but
also
from
spain
italy
germany
and
england
i
need
say
nothing
of
the
montpellier
method
of
cure
which
is
well
known
at
london
but
i
have
some
reason
to
think
the
great
professor
f
has
like
the
famous

that
were

thought
it
was
a
little
extraordinary
that
a
learned
professor
should
reply
in

tongue
to
a
case
put
in
latin
but
i
was
much
more
surprised
as
you
will
also
be
at

his

from
which
i
was
obliged
to
conclude
either
that
he
did
not
understand
latin
or
that
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
read

not

not
but
in

myself
point

sentiment
considering
the
nature
of
the
case
you
see
i
could
not
treat
him
more
civilly
i
desired
the
servant
to
ask
when
he
should
return
for
an
answer
and
whether
he
expected
another
fee
he
desired
him
to
come
next
morning
and
as
the
fellow
assured
me
gave
him
to
understand
that
whatever
monsieur
might
solicit
should
be
for
his
the
servant
advantage
in
all
probability
he
did
not
expect
another
gratification
to
which
indeed
he
had
no
title
mons
f
was
undoubtedly
much
mortified
to
find
himself
detected
in
such
flagrant
instances
of
unjustifiable
negligence
arid
like
all
other
persons
in
the
same
ungracious
dilemma
instead
of
justifying
himself
by
reason
or
argument
had
recourse
to
recrimination
in
the
paper
which
he
sent
me
next
day
he
insisted
in
general
that
he
had
carefully
perused
the
case
which
you
will
perceive
was
a
untruth
he
said
the
theory
it
contained
was
idle
that
he
was
sure
it
could
not
be
written
by
a
physician
that
with
respect
to
the
disorder
he
was
still
of
the
same
opinion
and
adhered
to
his
former
prescription
but
if
i
had
any
doubts
i
might
come
to
his
house
and
he
would
resolve
them
i
wrapt
up
twelve
livres
in
the
following
note
and
sent
it
to
his
house
ne

i

heaven
and
monsieur

to
this
i
received
for
answer

f
sir
you
have
no
doubts
remaining
i
am
very
glad
of
it
received
twelve
livres
fizes
instead
of
keeping
his
promise
to
the
valet
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
the
fellow
returned
in
a
rage
exclaiming
that
he
was
un
gros
cheval
de
carosse
a
great
i
shall
make
no
other
comment
upon
the
medicines
and
the
regimen
which
this
great
doctor
prescribed
but
that
he
certainly
mistook
the
case
that
upon
the
supposition
i
actually
laboured
under
a
purulent
discharge
from
the
lungs
his
remedies
savour
strongly
of
the
old
woman
and
that
there
is
a
total
blank
with
respect
to
the
article
of
exercise
which
you
know
is
so
essential
in
all
pulmonary
disorders
but
after
having
perused
my
remarks
upon
his
first
prescription
he
could
not
possibly
suppose
that
i
had
tubercules
and
was
spitting
up
pus
therefore
his
persisting
in
recommending
the
same
medicines
he
had
prescribed
on
that
supposition
was
a
flagrant
if
for
example
there
was
no
vomica
in
the
lungs
and
the
business
was
to
attenuate
the
lymph
what
could
be
more
preposterous
than
to
advise
the
chalk
of
briancon
coral
antihecticum
poterii
and
the
balm
of
canada
as
for
the
it
is
a
good
restorative
and
balsamic
but
i
apprehend
will
tend
to
thicken
rather
than
attenuate
the
phlegm
he
mentions
not
a
syllable
of
the
air
though
it
is
universally
allowed
that
the
climate
of
montpellier
is
pernicious
to
ulcerated
lungs
and
here
i
can
not
help
recounting
a
small
adventure
which
our
doctor
had
with
a
son
of
o
d
merchant
in
the
city
of
london
i
had
it
from
st
e
who
was
on
the
spot
the
young
gentleman
being
consumptive
consulted
f
who
continued
visiting
and
prescribing
for
him
a
whole
month
at
length
perceiving
that
he
grew
daily
worse
doctor
said
he
i
take
your
prescriptions
punctually
but
instead
of
being
the
better
for
them
i
have
now
not
an
hour
remission
from
the
fever
in
the
i
can
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
it
f
who
perceived
he
had
not
long
to
live
told
him
the
reason
was
very
plain
the
air
of
montpellier
was
too
sharp
for
his
lungs
which
required
a
softer
climate
then
you
a
sordid
villain
cried
the
young
man
for
allowing
me
to
stay
here
till
my
constitution
is
irretrievable
he
set
out
immediately
for
tholouse
and
in
a
few
weeks
died
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
city
i
observe
that
the
physicians
in
this
country
pay
no
regard
to
the
state
of
the
solids
in
chronical
disorders
that
exercise
and
the
cold
bath
are
never
prescribed
that
they
seem
to
think
the
scurvy
is
entirely
an
english
disease
and
that
in
all
appearance
they
often
confound
the
symptoms
of
it
with
those
of
the
venereal
distemper
perhaps
i
may
be
more
particular
on
this
subject
in
a
subsequent
letter
in
the
mean
time
i
am
ever
dear
sir
yours
sincerely
letter
xii
nice
december
dear
sir
the
inhabitants
of
montpellier
are
sociable
gay
and
they
have
a
spirit
of
commerce
and
have
erected
several
considerable
manufactures
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
people
assemble
every
day
to
take
the
air
on
the
esplanade
where
there
is
a
very
good
walk
just
without
the
gate
of
the
citadel
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
there
is
another
still
more
agreeable
called
the
peirou
from
whence
there
is
a
prospect
of
the
mediterranean
on
one
side
and
of
the
cevennes
on
the
other
here
is
a
good
equestrian
statue
of
louis
xiv
fronting
one
gate
of
the
city
which
is
built
in
form
of
a
triumphal
arch
in
honour
of
the
same
monarch
immediately
under
the
pierou
is
the
physic
garden
and
near
it
an
arcade
just
finished
for
an
aqueduct
to
convey
a
stream
of
water
to
the
upper
parts
of
the
city
perhaps
i
should
have
thought
this
a
neat
piece
of
work
if
i
had
not
seen
the
pont
du
garde
but
after
having
viewed
the
roman
arches
i
could
not
look
upon
this
but
with
pity
and
contempt
it
is
a
wonder
how
the
architect
could
be
so
fantastically
modern
having
such
a
noble
model
as
it
were
before
his
eyes
there
are
many
protestants
at
this
place
as
well
as
at
nismes
and
they
are
no
longer
molested
on
the
score
of
religion
they
have
their
conventicles
in
the
country
where
they
assemble
privately
for
worship
these
are
well
known
and
detachments
are
sent
out
every
sunday
to
intercept
them
but
the
officer
has
always
private
directions
to
take
another
route
whether
this
indulgence
comes
from
the
wisdom
and
lenity
of
the
government
or
is
purchased
with
money
of
the
commanding
officer
i
can
not
determine
but
certain
it
is
the
laws
of
france
punish
capitally
every
protestant
minister
convicted
of
having
performed
the
functions
of
his
ministry
in
this
kingdom
and
one
was
hanged
about
two
years
ago
in
the
neighbourhood
of
montauban
the
markets
in
montpellier
are
well
supplied
with
fish
poultry
butcher
meat
and
game
at
reasonable
rates
the
wine
of
the
country
is
strong
and
harsh
and
never
drank
but
when
mixed
with
water
burgundy
is
dear
and
so
is
the
sweet
wine
of
frontignan
though
made
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cette
you
know
it
is
famous
all
over
europe
and
so
are
the
liqueurs
or
drams
of
various
sorts
compounded
and
distilled
at
montpellier
cette
is
the
about
four
leagues
from
that
city
but
the
canal
of
languedoc
comes
up
within
a
mile
of
it
and
is
indeed
a
great
curiosity
a
work
in
all
respects
worthy
of
a
colbert
under
whose
auspices
it
was
finished
when
i
find
such
a
general
tribute
of
respect
and
veneration
paid
to
the
memory
of
that
great
man
i
am
astonished
to
see
so
few
monuments
of
public
utility
left
by
other
ministers
one
would
imagine
that
even
the
desire
of
praise
would
prompt
a
much
greater
number
to
exert
themselves
for
the
glory
and
advantage
of
their
country
yet
in
my
opinion
the
french
have
been
ungrateful
to
colbert
in
the
same
proportion
as
they
have
the
character
of
his
master
through
all
france
one
meets
with
statues
and
triumphal
arches
erected
to
louis
xiv
in
consequence
of
his
victories
by
which
likewise
he
acquired
the
title
of
louis
le
grand
but
how
were
those
victories
obtained
not
by
any
personal
merit
of
louis
it
was
colbert
who
improved
his
finances
and
enabled
him
to
pay
his
army
it
was
louvois
that
provided
all
the
necessaries
of
war
it
was
a
conde
a
turenne
a
luxemburg
a
vendome
who
fought
his
battles
and
his
first
conquests
for
which
he
was
deified
by
the
pen
of
adulation
were
obtained
almost
without
bloodshed
over
weak
dispirited
divided
and
defenceless
nations
it
was
colbert
that
improved
the
marine
instituted
manufactures
encouraged
commerce
undertook
works
of
public
utility
and
patronized
the
arts
and
sciences
but
louis
you
will
say
had
the
merit
of
choosing
and
supporting
those
ministers
and
those
generals
i
answer
no
he
found
colbert
and
louvois
already
chosen
he
found
conde
and
turenne
in
the
very
zenith
of
military
reputation
luxemburg
was
conde
pupil
and
vendome
a
prince
of
the
blood
who
at
first
obtained
the
command
of
armies
in
consequence
of
his
high
birth
and
happened
to
turn
out
a
man
of
genius
the
same
louis
had
the
sagacity
to
revoke
the
edict
of
nantz
to
entrust
his
armies
to
a
tallard
a
villeroy
and
a
marsin
he
had
the
humanity
to
ravage
the
country
burn
the
towns
and
massacre
the
people
of
the
palatinate
he
had
the
patriotism
to
impoverish
and
depopulate
his
own
kingdom
in
order
to
prosecute
schemes
of
the
most
lawless
ambition
he
had
the
consolation
to
beg
a
peace
from
those
he
had
provoked
to
war
by
the
most
outrageous
insolence
and
he
had
the
glory
to
espouse
maintenon
in
her
old
age
the
widow
of
the
buffoon
scarron
without
all
doubt
it
was
from
irony
he
acquired
the
title
le
grand
having
received
a
favourable
answer
from
b
the
english
consul
at
nice
and
recommended
the
care
of
my
heavy
baggage
to
ray
who
undertook
to
send
it
by
sea
from
cette
to
villefranche
i
hired
a
coach
and
mules
for
seven
and
set
out
from
montpellier
on
the
of
november
the
weather
being
agreeable
though
the
air
was
cold
and
frosty
in
other
respects
there
were
no
signs
of
winter
the
olives
were
now
ripe
and
appeared
on
each
side
of
the
road
as
black
as
sloes
and
the
corn
was
already
half
a
foot
high
on
the
second
day
of
our
journey
we
passed
the
rhone
on
a
bridge
of
boats
at
buccaire
and
lay
on
the
other
side
at
tarrascone
next
day
we
put
up
at
a
wretched
place
called
orgon
where
however
we
were
regaled
with
an
excellent
supper
and
among
other
delicacies
with
a
dish
of
green
pease
provence
is
a
pleasant
country
well
cultivated
but
the
inns
are
not
so
good
here
as
in
languedoc
and
few
of
them
are
provided
with
a
certain
convenience
which
an
english
traveller
can
very
ill
dispense
with
those
you
find
are
generally
on
the
tops
of
houses
exceedingly
nasty
and
so
much
exposed
to
the
weather
that
a
valetudinarian
can
not
use
them
without
hazard
of
his
life
at
nismes
in
languedoc
where
we
found
the
temple
of
cloacina
in
a
most
shocking
condition
the
told
me
her
mistress
had
caused
it
to
be
made
on
purpose
for
the
english
travellers
but
now
she
was
very
sorry
for
what
she
had
done
as
all
the
french
who
frequented
her
house
instead
of
using
the
seat
left
their
offerings
on
the
floor
which
she
was
obliged
to
have
cleaned
three
or
four
times
a
day
this
is
a
degree
of
beastliness
which
would
appear
detestable
even
in
the
capital
of
on
the
fourth
day
of
our
pilgrimage
we
lay
in
the
suburbs
of
aix
but
did
not
enter
the
city
which
i
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
the
villainous
asthma
baulked
me
of
that
satisfaction
i
was
pinched
with
the
cold
and
impatient
to
reach
a
warmer
climate
our
next
stage
was
at
a
paltry
village
where
we
were
poorly
entertained
i
looked
so
ill
in
the
morning
that
the
good
woman
of
the
house
who
was
big
with
child
took
me
by
the
hand
at
parting
and
even
shed
tears
praying
fervently
that
god
would
restore
me
to
my
health
this
was
the
only
instance
of
sympathy
compassion
or
goodness
of
heart
that
i
had
met
with
among
the
publicans
of
france
indeed
at
valencia
our
landlady
understanding
i
was
travelling
to
montpellier
for
my
health
would
have
dissuaded
me
from
going
thither
and
exhorted
me
in
particular
to
beware
of
the
physicians
who
were
all
a
pack
of
assassins
she
advised
me
to
eat
fricassees
of
chickens
and
white
meat
and
to
take
a
good
bouillon
every
morning
a
bouillon
is
an
universal
remedy
among
the
good
people
of
france
insomuch
that
they
have
no
idea
of
any
person
dying
after
having
swallowed
un
bon
bouillon
one
of
the
english
gentlemen
who
were
robbed
and
murdered
about
thirty
years
ago
between
calais
and
boulogne
being
brought
to
the
of
boulogne
with
some
signs
of
life
this
remedy
was
immediately
administered
what
surprises
me
greatly
said
the
speaking
of
this
melancholy
story
to
a
friend
of
mine
two
years
after
it
happened
i
made
an
excellent
bouillon
and
poured
it
down
his
throat
with
my
own
hands
and
yet
he
did
not
recover
now
in
all
probability
this
bouillon
it
was
that
stopped
his
breath
when
i
was
a
very
young
man
i
remember
to
have
seen
a
person
suffocated
by
such
impertinent
officiousness
a
young
man
of
uncommon
parts
and
erudition
very
well
esteemed
at
the
university
of
g
ow
was
found
early
one
morning
in
a
subterranean
vault
among
the
ruins
of
an
old
archiepiscopal
palace
with
his
throat
cut
from
ear
to
ear
being
conveyed
to
a
in
the
neighbourhood
he
made
signs
for
pen
ink
and
paper
and
in
all
probability
would
have
explained
the
cause
of
this
terrible
catastrophe
when
an
old
woman
seeing
the
windpipe
which
was
cut
sticking
out
of
the
wound
and
mistaking
it
for
the
gullet
by
way
of
giving
him
a
cordial
to
support
his
spirits
poured
into
it
through
a
small
funnel
a
glass
of
burnt
brandy
which
strangled
him
in
the
tenth
part
of
a
minute
the
gash
was
so
hideous
and
formed
by
so
many
repeated
strokes
of
a
razor
that
the
surgeons
believed
he
could
not
possibly
be
the
perpetrator
himself
nevertheless
this
was
certainly
the
case
at
brignolles
where
we
dined
i
was
obliged
to
quarrel
with
the
landlady
and
threaten
to
leave
her
house
before
she
would
indulge
us
with
any
sort
of
it
was
meagre
day
and
she
had
made
her
provision
accordingly
she
even
hinted
some
dissatisfaction
at
having
heretics
in
her
house
but
as
i
was
not
disposed
to
eat
stinking
fish
with
ragouts
of
eggs
and
onions
i
insisted
upon
a
leg
of
mutton
and
a
brace
of
fine
partridges
which
i
found
in
the
larder
next
day
when
we
set
out
in
the
morning
from
luc
it
blew
a
wind
so
extremely
cold
and
biting
that
even
a
flannel
wrapper
could
not
keep
me
tolerably
warm
in
the
coach
whether
the
cold
had
put
our
coachman
in
a
bad
humour
or
he
had
some
other
cause
of
resentment
against
himself
i
know
not
but
we
had
not
gone
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
he
drove
the
carriage
full
against
the
corner
of
a
garden
wall
and
broke
the
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
return
to
the
inn
on
foot
and
wait
a
whole
day
until
a
new
piece
could
be
made
and
adjusted
the
wind
that
blew
is
called
maestral
in
the
provencial
dialect
and
indeed
is
the
severest
that
ever
i
felt
at
this
inn
we
met
with
a
young
french
officer
who
had
been
a
prisoner
in
england
and
spoke
our
language
pretty
well
he
told
me
that
such
a
wind
did
not
blow
above
twice
or
three
times
in
a
winter
and
was
never
of
long
continuance
that
in
general
the
weather
was
very
mild
and
agreeable
during
the
winter
months
that
living
was
very
cheap
in
this
part
of
provence
which
afforded
great
plenty
of
game
here
too
i
found
a
young
irish
recollet
in
his
way
from
rome
to
his
own
country
he
complained
that
he
was
almost
starved
by
the
inhospitable
disposition
of
the
french
people
and
that
the
regular
clergy
in
particular
had
treated
him
with
the
most
cruel
disdain
i
relieved
his
necessities
and
gave
him
a
letter
to
a
gentleman
of
his
own
country
at
montpellier
when
i
rose
in
the
morning
and
opened
a
window
that
looked
into
the
garden
i
thought
myself
either
in
a
dream
or
bewitched
all
the
trees
were
cloathed
with
snow
and
all
the
country
covered
at
least
a
foot
thick
this
can
not
be
the
south
of
france
said
i
to
myself
it
must
be
the
highlands
of
scotland
at
a
wretched
town
called
muy
where
we
dined
i
had
a
warm
dispute
with
our
landlord
which
however
did
not
terminate
to
my
satisfaction
i
sent
on
the
mules
before
to
the
next
stage
resolving
to
take
and
bespoke
them
accordingly
of
the
aubergiste
who
was
at
the
same
time
and
we
were
ushered
into
the
common
and
had
a
very
indifferent
dinner
after
which
i
sent
a
to
be
changed
in
order
to
pay
the
reckoning
the
landlord
instead
of
giving
the
full
change
deducted
three
livres
a
head
for
dinner
and
sent
in
the
rest
of
the
money
by
my
servant
provoked
more
at
his
ill
manners
than
at
his
extortion
i
ferreted
him
out
of
a
where
he
had
concealed
himself
and
obliged
him
to
restore
the
full
change
from
which
i
paid
him
at
the
rate
of
two
livres
a
head
he
refused
to
take
the
money
which
i
threw
down
on
the
table
and
the
horses
being
ready
stepped
into
the
coach
ordering
the
postillions
to
drive
on
here
i
had
certainly
reckoned
without
my
host
the
fellows
declared
they
would
not
budge
until
i
should
pay
their
master
and
as
i
threatened
them
with
manual
chastisement
they
alighted
and
disappeared
in
a
twinkling
i
was
now
so
incensed
that
though
i
could
hardly
breathe
though
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
and
the
street
covered
with
wet
snow
i
walked
to
the
consul
of
the
town
and
made
my
complaint
in
form
this
magistrate
who
seemed
to
be
a
taylor
accompanied
me
to
the
inn
where
by
this
time
the
whole
town
was
assembled
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
me
to
compromise
the
affair
i
said
as
he
was
the
magistrate
i
would
stand
to
his
award
he
answered
that
he
would
not
presume
to
determine
what
i
was
to
pay
i
have
already
paid
him
a
reasonable
price
for
his
dinner
said
i
and
now
i
demand
according
to
the
king
ordonnance
the
aubergiste
said
the
horses
were
ready
but
the
guides
were
run
away
and
he
could
not
find
others
to
go
in
their
place
i
argued
with
great
vehemence
offering
to
leave
a
for
the
poor
of
the
parish
provided
the
consul
would
oblige
the
rascal
to
do
his
duty
the
consul
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
declared
it
was
not
in
his
power
this
was
a
lie
but
i
perceived
he
had
no
mind
to
disoblige
the
publican
if
the
mules
had
not
been
sent
away
i
should
certainly
have
not
only
payed
what
i
thought
proper
but
corrected
the
landlord
into
the
bargain
for
his
insolence
and
extortion
but
now
i
was
entirely
at
his
mercy
and
as
the
consul
continued
to
exhort
me
in
very
humble
terms
to
comply
with
his
demands
i
thought
proper
to
acquiesce
then
the
postillions
immediately
appeared
the
crowd
seemed
to
exult
in
the
triumph
of
the
aubergiste
and
i
was
obliged
to
travel
in
the
night
in
very
severe
weather
after
all
the
fatigue
and
mortification
i
had
undergone
we
lay
at
frejus
which
was
the
forum
julianum
of
the
antients
and
still
boasts
of
some
remains
of
antiquity
particularly
the
ruins
of
an
amphitheatre
and
an
aqueduct
the
first
we
passed
in
the
dark
and
next
morning
the
weather
was
so
cold
that
i
could
not
walk
abroad
to
see
it
the
town
is
at
present
very
inconsiderable
and
indeed
in
a
ruinous
condition
nevertheless
we
were
very
well
lodged
at
the
and
treated
with
more
politeness
than
we
had
met
with
in
any
other
part
of
france
as
we
had
a
very
high
mountain
to
ascend
in
the
morning
i
ordered
the
mules
on
before
to
the
next
post
and
hired
six
horses
for
the
coach
at
the
east
end
of
frejus
we
saw
close
to
the
road
on
our
the
arcades
of
the
antient
aqueduct
and
the
ruins
of
some
roman
edifices
which
seemed
to
have
been
temples
there
was
nothing
striking
in
the
architecture
of
the
aqueduct
the
arches
are
small
and
low
without
either
grace
or
ornament
and
seem
to
have
been
calculated
for
mere
utility
the
mountain
of
esterelles
which
is
eight
miles
over
was
formerly
frequented
by
a
gang
of
desperate
banditti
who
are
now
happily
exterminated
the
road
is
very
good
but
in
some
places
very
steep
and
bordered
by
precipices
the
mountain
is
covered
with
pines
and
the
laurus
cerasus
the
fruit
of
which
being
now
ripe
made
a
most
romantic
appearance
through
the
snow
that
lay
upon
the
branches
the
cherries
were
so
large
that
i
at
first
mistook
them
for
dwarf
oranges
i
think
they
are
counted
poisonous
in
england
but
here
the
people
eat
them
without
hesitation
in
the
middle
of
the
mountain
is
the
where
we
dined
in
a
room
so
cold
that
the
bare
remembrance
of
it
makes
my
teeth
chatter
after
dinner
i
chanced
to
look
into
another
chamber
that
fronted
the
south
where
the
sun
shone
and
opening
a
window
perceived
within
a
yard
of
my
hand
a
large
tree
loaded
with
oranges
many
of
which
were
ripe
you
may
judge
what
my
astonishment
was
to
find
winter
in
all
his
rigour
reigning
on
one
side
of
the
house
and
summer
in
all
her
glory
on
the
other
certain
it
is
the
middle
of
this
mountain
seemed
to
be
the
boundary
of
the
cold
weather
as
we
proceeded
slowly
in
the
afternoon
we
were
quite
enchanted
this
side
of
the
hill
is
a
natural
plantation
of
the
most
agreeable
pines
firs
laurel
cypress
sweet
myrtle
tamarisc
box
and
juniper
interspersed
with
sweet
marjoram
lavender
thyme
wild
thyme
and
sage
on
the
the
ground
shoots
up
into
agreeable
cones
between
which
you
have
delightful
vistas
of
the
mediterranean
which
washes
the
foot
of
the
rock
and
between
two
divisions
of
the
mountains
there
is
a
bottom
watered
by
a
charming
stream
which
greatly
adds
to
the
rural
beauties
of
the
scene
this
night
we
passed
at
cannes
a
little
fishing
town
agreeably
situated
on
the
beach
of
the
sea
and
in
the
same
place
lodged
monsieur
nadeau
the
unfortunate
french
governor
of
guadeloupe
condemned
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
in
one
of
the
isles
marguerite
which
lie
within
a
mile
of
this
coast
next
day
we
journeyed
by
the
way
of
antibes
a
small
maritime
town
tolerably
well
fortified
and
passing
the
little
river
loup
over
a
arrived
about
noon
at
the
village
of
laurent
the
extremity
of
france
where
we
passed
the
var
after
our
baggage
had
undergone
examination
from
cannes
to
this
village
the
road
lies
along
the
and
sure
nothing
can
be
more
delightful
though
in
the
morning
there
was
a
frost
upon
the
ground
the
sun
was
as
warm
as
it
is
in
may
in
england
the
sea
was
quite
smooth
and
the
beach
formed
of
white
polished
pebbles
on
the
the
country
was
covered
with
green
olives
and
the
side
of
the
road
planted
with
large
trees
of
sweet
myrtle
growing
wild
like
the
hawthorns
in
england
from
antibes
we
had
the
first
view
of
nice
lying
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bay
and
making
a
very
agreeable
appearance
the
author
of
the
grand
tour
says
that
from
antibes
to
nice
the
roads
are
very
bad
through
rugged
mountains
bordered
with
precipices
on
the
left
and
by
the
sea
to
the
right
whereas
in
fact
there
is
neither
precipice
nor
mountain
near
it
the
var
which
divides
the
county
of
nice
from
provence
is
no
other
than
a
torrent
fed
chiefly
by
the
snow
that
melts
on
the
maritime
alps
from
which
it
takes
its
origin
in
the
summer
it
is
swelled
to
a
dangerous
height
and
this
is
also
the
case
after
heavy
rains
but
at
present
the
middle
of
it
is
quite
dry
and
the
water
divided
into
two
or
three
narrow
streams
which
however
are
both
deep
and
rapid
this
river
has
been
absurdly
enough
by
some
supposed
the
rubicon
in
all
probability
from
the
description
of
that
river
in
the
pharsalia
of
lucan
who
makes
it
the
boundary
betwixt
gaul
and
italy
et
gallica
certus
limes
ab
ausoniis
disterminat
arva
colonis
a
sure
frontier
that
parts
the
gallic
plains
from
the
rich
meadows
of
th
ansonian
swains
whereas
in
fact
the
rubicon
now
called
pisatello
runs
between
ravenna
and
but
to
return
to
the
var
at
the
village
of
laurent
famous
for
its
muscadine
wines
there
is
a
set
of
guides
always
in
attendance
to
conduct
you
in
your
passage
over
the
river
six
of
those
fellows
tucked
up
above
the
middle
with
long
poles
in
their
hands
took
charge
of
our
coach
and
by
many
windings
guided
it
safe
to
the
opposite
shore
indeed
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
but
it
is
a
sort
of
a
perquisite
and
i
did
not
choose
to
run
any
risque
how
small
soever
it
might
be
for
the
sake
of
saving
half
a
crown
with
which
they
were
satisfied
if
you
do
not
gratify
the
searchers
at
laurent
with
the
same
sum
they
will
rummage
your
trunks
and
turn
all
your
cloaths
topsy
turvy
and
here
once
for
all
i
would
advise
every
traveller
who
consults
his
own
case
and
convenience
to
be
liberal
of
his
money
to
all
that
sort
of
people
and
even
to
wink
at
the
imposition
of
aubergistes
on
the
road
unless
it
be
very
flagrant
so
sure
as
you
enter
into
disputes
with
them
you
will
be
put
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
fret
yourself
to
no
manner
of
purpose
i
have
travelled
with
oeconomists
in
england
who
declared
they
would
rather
give
away
a
crown
than
allow
themselves
to
be
cheated
of
a
farthing
this
is
a
good
maxim
but
requires
a
great
share
of
resolution
and
to
put
it
in
practice
in
one
excursion
of
about
two
hundred
miles
my
was
in
a
passion
and
of
consequence
very
bad
company
from
one
end
of
the
journey
to
the
other
he
was
incessantly
scolding
either
at
landlords
landladies
waiters
hostlers
or
postilions
we
had
bad
horses
and
bad
chaises
set
out
from
every
stage
with
the
curses
of
the
people
and
at
this
expence
i
saved
about
ten
shillings
in
the
whole
journey
for
such
a
paltry
consideration
he
was
contented
to
be
miserable
himself
and
to
make
every
other
person
unhappy
with
whom
he
had
any
concern
when
i
came
last
from
bath
it
rained
so
hard
that
the
postilion
who
drove
the
chaise
was
wet
to
the
skin
before
we
had
gone
a
couple
of
miles
when
we
arrived
at
the
devises
i
gave
him
two
shillings
instead
of
one
out
of
pure
compassion
the
consequence
of
this
liberality
was
that
in
the
next
stage
we
seemed
rather
to
fly
than
to
travel
upon
solid
ground
i
continued
my
bounty
to
the
second
driver
and
indeed
through
the
whole
journey
and
found
myself
accommodated
in
a
very
different
manner
from
what
i
had
experienced
before
i
had
elegant
chaises
with
excellent
horses
and
the
postilions
of
their
own
accord
used
such
diligence
that
although
the
roads
were
broken
by
the
rain
i
travelled
at
the
rate
of
twelve
miles
an
hour
and
my
extraordinary
expence
from
bath
to
london
amounted
precisely
to
six
shillings
the
river
var
falls
into
the
mediterranean
a
little
below
laurent
about
four
miles
to
the
westward
of
nice
within
the
memory
of
persons
now
living
there
have
been
three
wooden
bridges
thrown
over
it
and
as
often
destroyed
in
consequence
of
the
jealousy
subsisting
between
the
kings
of
france
and
sardinia
this
river
being
the
boundary
of
their
dominions
on
the
side
of
provence
however
this
is
a
consideration
that
ought
not
to
interfere
with
the
other
advantages
that
would
accrue
to
both
kingdoms
from
such
a
convenience
if
there
was
a
bridge
over
the
var
and
a
made
from
nice
to
genoa
i
am
very
confident
that
all
those
strangers
who
now
pass
the
alps
in
their
way
to
and
from
italy
would
choose
this
road
as
infinitely
more
safe
commodious
and
agreeable
this
would
also
be
the
case
with
all
those
who
hire
felucas
from
marseilles
or
antibes
and
expose
themselves
to
the
dangers
and
inconveniences
of
travelling
by
sea
in
an
open
boat
in
the
afternoon
we
arrived
at
nice
where
we
found
m
e
the
english
gentleman
whom
i
had
seen
at
boulogne
and
advised
to
come
hither
he
had
followed
my
advice
and
reached
nice
about
a
month
before
my
arrival
with
his
lady
child
and
an
old
gouvernante
he
had
travelled
with
his
own
and
horses
and
is
now
lodged
just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
the
city
in
the
house
of
the
count
de
v
n
for
which
he
pays
five
a
month
i
could
hire
one
much
better
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
for
the
same
money
unless
you
will
submit
to
this
extortion
and
hire
a
whole
house
for
a
length
of
time
you
will
find
no
lodgings
at
nice
after
having
stewed
a
week
in
a
paltry
inn
i
have
taken
a
ground
floor
for
ten
months
at
the
rate
of
four
hundred
livres
a
year
that
is
twenty
pounds
sterling
for
the
piedmontese
livre
is
about
an
english
shilling
the
apartments
are
large
lofty
and
commodious
enough
with
two
small
gardens
in
which
there
is
plenty
of
sallad
and
a
great
number
of
oranges
and
lemons
but
as
it
required
some
time
to
provide
furniture
our
consul
b
d
one
of
the
best
natured
and
most
friendly
men
in
the
world
has
lent
me
his
lodgings
which
are
charmingly
situated
by
the
and
open
upon
a
terrace
that
runs
parallel
to
the
beach
forming
part
of
the
town
wall
b
d
himself
lives
at
villa
franca
which
is
divided
from
nice
by
a
single
mountain
on
the
top
of
which
there
is
a
small
fort
called
the
castle
of
montalban
immediately
after
our
arrival
we
were
visited
by
one
de
martines
a
most
agreeable
young
fellow
a
lieutenant
in
the
swiss
regiment
which
is
here
in
garrison
he
is
a
protestant
extremely
fond
of
our
nation
and
understands
our
language
tolerably
well
he
was
particularly
recommended
to
our
acquaintance
by
general
p
and
his
lady
we
are
happy
in
his
conversation
find
him
wonderfully
obliging
and
extremely
serviceable
on
many
occasions
we
have
likewise
made
acquaintance
with
some
other
individuals
particularly
with
pierre
junior
who
is
a
considerable
merchant
and
consul
for
naples
he
is
a
sensible
young
man
speaks
english
is
an
excellent
performer
on
the
lute
and
mandolin
and
has
a
pretty
collection
of
books
in
a
word
i
hope
we
shall
pass
the
winter
agreeably
enough
especially
if
m
e
should
hold
out
but
i
am
afraid
he
is
too
far
gone
in
a
consumption
to
recover
he
spent
the
last
winter
at
nismes
and
consulted
f
at
montpellier
i
was
impatient
to
see
the
prescription
and
found
it
almost
verbatim
the
same
he
had
sent
to
me
although
i
am
persuaded
there
is
a
very
essential
difference
between
our
disorders
m
e
has
been
long
afflicted
with
violent
spasms
colliquative
sweats
prostration
of
appetite
and
a
disorder
in
his
bowels
he
is
likewise
jaundiced
all
over
and
i
am
confident
his
liver
is
unsound
he
tried
the
tortoise
soup
which
he
said
in
a
fortnight
stuffed
him
up
with
phlegm
this
gentleman
has
got
a
smattering
of
physic
and
i
am
afraid
tampers
with
his
own
constitution
by
means
of
brookes
practice
of
physic
and
some
dispensatories
which
he
is
continually
poring
over
i
beg
pardon
for
this
tedious
epistle
and
am
very
sincerely
dear
sir
your
affectionate
humble
servant
letter
xiii
nice
january
dear
sir
i
am
at
last
settled
at
nice
and
have
leisure
to
give
you
some
account
of
this
very
remarkable
place
the
county
of
nice
extends
about
fourscore
miles
in
length
and
in
some
places
it
is
thirty
miles
broad
it
contains
several
small
towns
and
a
great
number
of
villages
all
of
which
this
capital
excepted
are
situated
among
mountains
the
most
extensive
plain
of
the
whole
country
being
this
where
i
now
am
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nice
the
length
of
it
does
not
exceed
two
miles
nor
is
the
breadth
of
it
in
any
part
above
one
it
is
bounded
by
the
mediterranean
on
the
south
from
the
the
maritime
alps
begin
with
hills
of
a
gentle
ascent
rising
into
mountains
that
form
a
sweep
or
amphitheatre
ending
at
montalban
which
overhangs
the
town
of
villa
franca
on
the
west
side
of
this
mountain
and
in
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
amphitheatre
stands
the
city
of
nice
wedged
in
between
a
steep
rock
and
the
little
river
paglion
which
descends
from
the
mountains
and
washing
the
on
the
west
side
falls
into
the
sea
after
having
filled
some
canals
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitants
there
is
a
of
three
arches
over
it
by
which
those
who
come
from
provence
enter
the
city
the
channel
of
it
is
very
broad
but
generally
dry
in
many
places
the
water
as
in
the
var
dividing
itself
into
several
small
streams
the
paglion
being
fed
by
melted
snow
and
rain
in
the
mountains
is
quite
dry
in
summer
but
it
is
sometimes
swelled
by
sudden
rains
to
a
very
formidable
torrent
this
was
the
case
in
the
year
when
the
french
and
spanish
armies
attacked
eighteen
piedmontese
battalions
which
were
posted
on
the
side
of
montalban
the
assailants
were
repulsed
with
the
loss
of
four
thousand
men
some
hundreds
of
whom
perished
in
repassing
the
paglion
which
had
swelled
to
a
surprising
degree
during
the
battle
in
consequence
of
a
heavy
continued
rain
this
rain
was
of
great
service
to
the
piedmontese
as
it
prevented
one
half
of
the
enemy
from
passing
the
river
to
sustain
the
other
five
hundred
were
taken
prisoners
but
the
piedmontese
foreseeing
they
should
be
surrounded
next
day
by
the
french
who
had
penetrated
behind
them
by
a
pass
in
the
mountains
retired
in
the
night
being
received
on
board
the
english
fleet
which
lay
at
villa
franca
they
were
conveyed
to
oneglia
in
examining
the
bodies
of
those
that
were
killed
in
the
battle
the
inhabitants
of
nice
perceived
that
a
great
number
of
the
spanish
soldiers
were
circumcised
a
circumstance
from
which
they
concluded
that
a
great
many
jews
engage
in
the
service
of
his
catholic
majesty
i
am
of
a
different
opinion
the
jews
are
the
least
of
any
people
that
i
know
addicted
to
a
military
life
i
rather
imagine
they
were
of
the
moorish
race
who
have
subsisted
in
spain
since
the
expulsion
of
their
brethren
and
though
they
conform
externally
to
the
rites
of
the
catholic
religion
still
retain
in
private
their
attachment
to
the
law
of
mahomet
the
city
of
nice
is
built
in
form
of
an
irregular
isosceles
triangle
the
base
of
which
fronts
the
sea
on
the
west
side
it
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
and
rampart
on
the
east
it
is
by
a
rock
on
which
we
see
the
ruins
of
an
old
castle
which
before
the
invention
of
artillery
was
counted
impregnable
it
was
taken
and
dismantled
by
marechal
catinat
in
the
time
of
victor
amadaeus
the
father
of
his
sardinian
majesty
it
was
afterwards
finally
demolished
by
the
duke
of
berwick
towards
the
latter
end
of
queen
anne
war
to
repair
it
would
be
a
very
unnecessary
expence
as
it
is
commanded
by
montalban
and
several
other
eminences
the
town
of
nice
is
altogether
indefensible
and
therefore
without
fortifications
there
are
only
two
iron
guns
upon
a
bastion
that
fronts
the
beach
and
here
the
french
had
formed
a
considerable
battery
against
the
english
cruisers
in
the
war
of
when
the
mareschal
duke
de
belleisle
had
his
headquarters
at
nice
this
little
town
situated
in
the
bay
of
antibes
is
almost
equidistant
from
marseilles
turin
and
genoa
the
first
and
last
being
about
thirty
leagues
from
hence
by
sea
and
the
capital
of
piedmont
at
the
same
distance
to
the
northward
over
the
mountains
it
lies
exactly
opposite
to
capo
di
ferro
on
the
coast
of
barbary
and
the
islands
of
sardinia
and
corsica
are
laid
down
about
two
degrees
to
the
eastward
almost
exactly
in
a
line
with
genoa
this
little
town
hardly
a
mile
in
circumference
is
said
to
contain
twelve
thousand
inhabitants
the
streets
are
narrow
the
houses
are
built
of
stone
and
the
windows
in
general
are
fitted
with
paper
instead
of
glass
this
expedient
would
not
answer
in
a
country
subject
to
rain
and
storms
but
here
where
there
is
very
little
of
either
the
paper
lozenges
answer
tolerably
well
the
bourgeois
however
begin
to
have
their
houses
sashed
with
glass
between
the
and
the
sea
the
fishermen
haul
up
their
boats
upon
the
open
beach
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
where
the
castle
stood
is
the
port
or
harbour
of
nice
upon
which
some
money
has
been
expended
it
is
a
small
basin
defended
to
seaward
by
a
mole
of
which
is
much
better
contrived
than
executed
for
the
sea
has
already
made
three
breaches
in
it
and
in
all
probability
in
another
winter
the
extremity
of
it
will
be
carried
quite
away
it
would
require
the
talents
of
a
very
skilful
architect
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
good
mole
on
an
open
beach
like
this
exposed
to
the
swell
of
the
whole
mediterranean
without
any
island
or
rock
in
the
offing
to
break
the
force
of
the
waves
besides
the
shore
is
bold
and
the
bottom
foul
there
are
seventeen
feet
of
water
in
the
basin
sufficient
to
float
vessels
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
ton
and
this
is
chiefly
supplied
by
a
small
stream
of
very
fine
water
another
great
convenience
for
shipping
on
the
side
of
the
mole
there
is
a
constant
guard
of
soldiers
and
a
battery
of
seven
cannon
pointing
to
the
sea
on
the
other
side
there
is
a
curious
manufacture
for
twisting
or
reeling
silk
a
tavern
a
and
several
other
buildings
for
the
convenience
of
the
people
without
the
harbour
is
a
lazarette
where
persons
coming
from
infected
places
are
obliged
to
perform
quarantine
the
harbour
has
been
declared
a
and
it
is
generally
full
of
tartans
polacres
and
other
small
vessels
that
come
from
sardinia
ivica
italy
and
spain
loaded
with
salt
wine
and
other
commodities
but
here
is
no
trade
of
any
great
consequence
the
city
of
nice
is
provided
with
a
senate
which
administers
justice
under
the
auspices
of
an
sent
hither
by
the
king
the
internal
oeconomy
of
the
town
is
managed
by
four
consuls
one
for
the
noblesse
another
for
the
merchants
a
third
for
the
bourgeois
and
a
fourth
for
the
peasants
these
are
chosen
annually
from
the
they
keep
the
streets
and
markets
in
order
and
superintend
the
public
works
there
is
also
an
intendant
who
takes
care
of
his
majesty
revenue
but
there
is
a
discretionary
power
lodged
in
the
person
of
the
commandant
who
is
always
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
service
and
has
under
his
immediate
command
the
regiment
which
is
here
in
garrison
that
which
is
here
now
is
a
swiss
battalion
of
which
the
king
has
five
or
six
in
his
service
there
is
likewise
a
regiment
of
militia
which
is
exercised
once
a
year
but
of
all
these
particulars
i
shall
speak
more
fully
on
another
occasion
when
i
stand
upon
the
rampart
and
look
round
me
i
can
scarce
help
thinking
myself
inchanted
the
small
extent
of
country
which
i
see
is
all
cultivated
like
a
garden
indeed
the
plain
presents
nothing
but
gardens
full
of
green
trees
loaded
with
oranges
lemons
citrons
and
bergamots
which
make
a
delightful
appearance
if
you
examine
them
more
nearly
you
will
find
plantations
of
green
pease
ready
to
gather
all
sorts
of
sallading
and
in
perfection
and
plats
of
roses
carnations
ranunculas
anemonies
and
daffodils
blowing
in
full
glory
with
such
beauty
vigour
and
perfume
as
no
flower
in
england
ever
exhibited
i
must
tell
you
that
presents
of
carnations
are
sent
from
hence
in
the
winter
to
turin
and
paris
nay
sometimes
as
far
as
london
by
the
post
they
are
packed
up
in
a
wooden
box
without
any
sort
of
preparation
one
pressed
upon
another
the
person
who
receives
them
cuts
off
a
little
bit
of
the
stalk
and
steeps
them
for
two
hours
in
vinegar
and
water
when
they
recover
their
full
bloom
and
beauty
then
he
places
them
in
in
an
apartment
where
they
are
screened
from
the
severities
of
the
weather
and
they
will
continue
fresh
and
unfaded
the
best
part
of
a
month
amidst
the
plantations
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nice
appear
a
vast
number
of
white
bastides
or
which
make
a
dazzling
shew
some
few
of
these
are
good
villas
belonging
to
the
noblesse
of
this
county
and
even
some
of
the
bourgeois
are
provided
with
pretty
lodgeable
cassines
but
in
general
they
are
the
habitations
of
the
peasants
and
contain
nothing
but
misery
and
vermin
they
are
all
built
square
and
being
whitened
with
lime
or
plaister
contribute
greatly
to
the
richness
of
the
view
the
hills
are
shaded
to
the
tops
with
which
are
always
green
and
those
hills
are
by
more
distant
mountains
covered
with
snow
when
i
turn
myself
towards
the
sea
the
view
is
bounded
by
the
horizon
yet
in
a
clear
morning
one
can
perceive
the
high
lands
of
corsica
on
the
right
hand
it
is
terminated
by
antibes
and
the
mountain
of
esterelles
which
i
described
in
my
last
as
for
the
weather
you
will
conclude
from
what
i
have
said
of
the
oranges
flowers
etc
that
it
must
be
wonderfully
mild
and
serene
but
of
the
climate
i
shall
speak
hereafter
let
me
only
observe
en
passant
that
the
houses
in
general
have
no
chimnies
but
in
their
kitchens
and
that
many
people
even
of
condition
at
nice
have
no
fire
in
their
chambers
during
the
whole
winter
when
the
weather
happens
to
be
a
little
more
sharp
than
usual
they
warm
their
apartments
with
a
brasiere
or
pan
of
charcoal
though
nice
itself
retains
few
marks
of
antient
splendor
there
are
considerable
monuments
of
antiquity
in
its
neighbourhood
about
two
short
miles
from
the
town
upon
the
summit
of
a
pretty
high
hill
we
find
the
ruins
of
the
antient
city
cemenelion
now
called
cimia
which
was
once
the
metropolis
of
the
maritime
alps
and
the
scat
of
a
roman
president
with
respect
to
situation
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
or
salubrious
it
stood
upon
the
gentle
ascent
and
summit
of
a
hill
fronting
the
mediterranean
from
the
shore
of
which
it
is
distant
about
half
a
league
and
on
the
other
side
it
overlooked
a
bottom
or
narrow
vale
through
which
the
paglion
antiently
called
paulo
runs
towards
the
walls
of
nice
it
was
inhabited
by
a
people
whom
ptolomy
and
pliny
call
the
vedantij
but
these
were
undoubtedly
mixed
with
a
roman
colony
as
appears
by
the
monuments
which
still
remain
i
mean
the
ruins
of
an
amphitheatre
a
temple
of
apollo
baths
aqueducts
sepulchral
and
other
stones
with
inscriptions
and
a
great
number
of
medals
which
the
peasants
have
found
by
accident
in
digging
and
labouring
the
vineyards
and
cornfields
which
now
cover
the
ground
where
the
city
stood
touching
this
city
very
little
is
to
be
learned
from
the
antient
historians
but
that
it
was
the
seat
of
a
roman
praeses
is
proved
by
the
two
following
inscriptions
which
are
still
extant
aelio
severino
praesidi
optimo
ordo
cemen
patrono
by
the
senate
of

now

the
ruinous

in
searching
for
discovering
and
restoring
the
water
to
its
former
course
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
this
president
well
deserved
such
a
mark
of
respect
from
a
people
whom
he
had
assisted
in
two
such
essential
articles
as
their
corn
and
their

you
know
the
praeses
of
a

stands
at

this

who
suffered
martyrdom
at
cemenelion
in
the

during
the
reigns
of

wrought
in

of
this

both
before

after
his

charles
emperor

i
do
pretend
to
translate
these
inscriptions
literally
because
i
am
doubtful
about
the
meaning
of
some
abbreviations
the
amphitheatre
of
cemenelion
is
but
very
small
compared
to
that
of
nismes
the
arena
is
ploughed
up
and
bears
corn
some
of
the
seats
remain
and
part
of
two
opposite
porticos
but
all
the
columns
and
the
external
facade
of
the
building
are
taken
away
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
judge
of
the
architecture
all
we
can
perceive
is
that
it
was
built
in
an
oval
form
about
one
hundred
paces
from
the
amphitheatre
stood
an
antient
temple
supposed
to
have
been
dedicated
to
apollo
the
original
roof
is
demolished
as
well
as
the
portico
the
vestiges
of
which
may
still
be
traced
the
part
called
the
basilica
and
about
one
half
of
the
cella
sanctior
remain
and
are
converted
into
the
and
stable
of
the
peasant
who
takes
care
of
the
count
de
gubernatis
garden
in
which
this
monument
stands
in
the
cella
sanctior
i
found
a
lean
cow
a
and
a
the
very
same
conjunction
of
animals
which
i
had
seen
drawing
a
plough
in
burgundy
several
mutilated
statues
have
been
dug
up
from
the
ruins
of
this
temple
and
a
great
number
of
medals
have
been
found
in
the
different
vineyards
which
now
occupy
the
space
upon
which
stood
the
antient
city
of
cemenelion
these
were
of
gold
silver
and
brass
many
of
them
were
presented
to
charles
emanuel
duke
of
savoy
the
prince
of
monaco
has
a
good
number
of
them
in
his
collection
and
the
rest
are
in
private
hands
the
peasants
in
digging
have
likewise
found
many
urns
lachrymatories
and
sepulchral
stones
with
epitaphs
which
are
now
dispersed
among
different
convents
and
private
houses
all
this
ground
is
a
rich
mine
of
antiquities
which
if
properly
worked
would
produce
a
great
number
of
valuable
curiosities
just
by
the
temple
of
apollo
were
the
ruins
of
a
bath
composed
of
great
blocks
of
marble
which
have
been
taken
away
for
the
purposes
of
modern
building
in
all
probability
many
other
noble
monuments
of
this
city
have
been
dilapidated
by
the
same
barbarous
oeconomy
there
are
some
subterranean
vaults
through
which
the
water
was
conducted
to
this
bath
still
extant
in
the
garden
of
the
count
de
gubernatis
of
the
aqueduct
that
conveyed
water
to
the
town
i
can
say
very
little
but
that
it
was
scooped
through
a
mountain
that
this
subterranean
passage
was
discovered
some
years
ago
by
removing
the
rubbish
which
choaked
it
up
that
the
people
penetrating
a
considerable
way
by
the
help
of
lighted
torches
found
a
very
plentiful
stream
of
water
flowing
in
an
aqueduct
as
high
as
an
ordinary
man
arched
over
head
and
lined
with
a
sort
of
cement
they
could
not
however
trace
this
stream
to
its
source
and
it
is
again
stopped
up
with
earth
and
rubbish
there
is
not
a
soul
in
this
country
who
has
either
spirit
or
understanding
to
conduct
an
inquiry
of
this
kind
hard
by
the
amphitheatre
is
a
convent
of
recollets
built
in
a
very
romantic
situation
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
on
one
side
of
their
garden
they
ascend
to
a
kind
of
esplanade
which
they
say
was
part
of
the
citadel
of
cemenelion
they
have
planted
it
with
and
one
of
the
monks
told
me
that
it
is
vaulted
below
as
they
can
plainly
perceive
by
the
sound
of
their
instruments
used
in
houghing
the
ground
a
very
small
expence
would
bring
the
secrets
of
this
cavern
to
light
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
a
breach
in
the
wall
which
appears
uncovered
towards
the
garden
the
city
of
cemenelion
was
first
sacked
by
the
longobards
who
made
an
irruption
into
provence
under
their
king
alboinus
about
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
it
was
afterwards
totally
destroyed
by
the
saracens
who
at
different
times
ravaged
this
whole
coast
the
remains
of
the
people
are
supposed
to
have
changed
their
habitation
and
formed
a
coalition
with
the
inhabitants
of
nice
what
further
i
have
to
say
of
nice
you
shall
know
in
good
time
at
present
i
have
nothing
to
add
but
what
you
very
well
know
that
i
am
always
your
affectionate
humble
servant
letter
xiv
nice
january
dear
sir
last
sunday
i
crossed
montalban
on
horseback
with
some
swiss
officers
on
a
visit
to
our
consul
b
d
who
lives
at
ville
franche
about
half
a
league
from
nice
it
is
a
small
town
built
upon
the
side
of
a
rock
at
the
bottom
of
the
harbour
which
is
a
fine
basin
surrounded
with
hills
on
every
side
except
to
the
south
where
it
lies
open
to
the
sea
if
there
was
a
small
island
in
the
mouth
of
it
to
break
off
the
force
of
the
waves
when
the
wind
is
southerly
it
would
be
one
of
the
finest
harbours
in
the
world
for
the
ground
is
exceeding
good
for
anchorage
there
is
a
sufficient
depth
of
water
and
room
enough
for
the
whole
navy
of
england
on
the
right
hand
as
you
enter
the
port
there
is
an
elegant
fanal
or
lighthouse
kept
in
good
repair
but
in
all
the
charts
of
this
coast
which
i
have
seen
this
lanthorn
is
laid
down
to
the
westward
of
the
harbour
an
error
equally
absurd
and
dangerous
as
it
may
mislead
the
navigator
and
induce
him
to
run
his
ship
among
the
rocks
to
the
eastward
of
the
lighthouse
where
it
would
undoubtedly
perish
opposite
to
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
is
the
fort
which
can
be
of
no
service
but
in
defending
the
shipping
and
the
town
by
sea
for
by
land
it
is
commanded
by
montalban
and
all
the
hills
in
the
neighbourhood
in
the
war
of
it
was
taken
and
retaken
at
present
it
is
in
tolerable
good
repair
on
the
left
of
the
fort
is
the
basin
for
the
gallies
with
a
kind
of
dock
in
which
they
are
built
and
occasionally
laid
up
to
be
refitted
this
basin
is
formed
by
a
pretty
stone
mole
and
here
his
sardinian
majesty
two
gallies
lie
perfectly
secure
moored
with
their
sterns
close
to
the
jette
i
went
on
board
one
of
these
vessels
and
saw
about
two
hundred
miserable
wretches
chained
to
the
banks
on
which
they
sit
and
row
when
the
galley
is
at
sea
this
is
a
sight
which
a
british
subject
sensible
of
the
blessing
he
enjoys
can
not
behold
without
horror
and
compassion
not
but
that
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
case
with
coolness
and
deliberation
we
must
acknowledge
the
justice
and
even
sagacity
of
employing
for
the
service
of
the
public
those
malefactors
who
have
forfeited
their
title
to
the
privileges
of
the
community
among
the
slaves
at
ville
franche
is
a
piedmontese
count
condemned
to
the
gallies
for
life
in
consequence
of
having
been
convicted
of
forgery
he
is
permitted
to
live
on
shore
and
gets
money
by
employing
the
other
slaves
to
knit
stockings
for
sale
he
appears
always
in
the
turkish
habit
and
is
in
a
fair
way
of
raising
a
better
fortune
than
that
which
he
has
forfeited
it
is
a
great
pity
however
and
a
manifest
outrage
against
the
law
of
nations
as
well
as
of
humanity
to
mix
with
those
banditti
the
moorish
and
turkish
prisoners
who
are
taken
in
the
prosecution
of
open
war
it
is
certainly
no
justification
of
this
barbarous
practice
that
the
christian
prisoners
are
treated
as
cruelly
at
tunis
and
algiers
it
would
be
for
the
honour
of
christendom
to
set
an
example
of
generosity
to
the
turks
and
if
they
would
not
follow
it
to
join
their
naval
forces
and
extirpate
at
once
those
nests
of
pirates
who
have
so
long
infested
the
mediterranean
certainly
nothing
can
be
more
shameful
than
the
treaties
which
france
and
the
maritime
powers
have
concluded
with
those
barbarians
they
supply
them
with
artillery
arms
and
ammunition
to
disturb
their
neighbours
they
even
pay
them
a
sort
of
tribute
under
the
denomination
of
presents
and
often
put
up
with
insults
tamely
for
the
sordid
consideration
of
a
little
gain
in
the
way
of
commerce
they
know
that
spain
sardinia
and
almost
all
the
catholic
powers
in
the
mediterranean
adriatic
and
levant
are
at
perpetual
war
with
those
mahometans
that
while
algiers
tunis
and
sallee
maintain
armed
cruisers
at
sea
those
christian
powers
will
not
run
the
risque
of
trading
in
their
own
bottoms
but
rather
employ
as
carriers
the
maritime
nations
who
are
at
peace
with
the
infidels
it
is
for
our
share
of
this
advantage
that
we
cultivate
the
piratical
states
of
barbary
and
meanly
purchase
passports
of
them
thus
acknowledging
them
masters
of
the
mediterranean
the
sardinian
gallies
are
mounted
each
with
oars
and
six
guns
of
a
side
and
a
large
piece
of
artillery
amidships
pointing
ahead
which
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
can
never
be
used
without
demolishing
the
head
or
prow
of
the
galley
the
accommodation
on
board
for
the
officers
is
wretched
there
is
a
paltry
cabin
in
the
poop
for
the
commander
but
all
the
other
officers
lie
below
the
slaves
in
a
dungeon
where
they
have
neither
light
air
nor
any
degree
of
quiet
half
suffocated
by
the
heat
of
the
place
tormented
by
fleas
bugs
and
lice
and
disturbed
by
the
incessant
noise
over
head
the
slaves
lie
upon
the
naked
banks
without
any
other
covering
than
a
tilt
this
however
is
no
great
hardship
in
a
climate
where
there
is
scarce
any
winter
they
are
fed
with
a
very
scanty
allowance
of
bread
and
about
fourteen
beans
a
day
and
twice
a
week
they
have
a
little
rice
or
cheese
but
most
of
them
while
they
are
in
harbour
knit
stockings
or
do
some
other
kind
of
work
which
enables
them
to
make
some
addition
to
this
wretched
allowance
when
they
happen
to
be
at
sea
in
bad
weather
their
situation
is
truly
deplorable
every
wave
breaks
over
the
vessel
and
not
only
keeps
them
continually
wet
but
comes
with
such
force
that
they
are
dashed
against
the
banks
with
surprising
violence
sometimes
their
limbs
are
broke
and
sometimes
their
brains
dashed
out
it
is
impossible
they
say
to
keep
such
a
number
of
desperate
people
under
any
regular
command
without
exercising
such
severities
as
must
shock
humanity
it
is
almost
equally
impossible
to
maintain
any
tolerable
degree
of
cleanliness
where
such
a
number
of
wretches
are
crouded
together
without
conveniences
or
even
the
necessaries
of
life
they
are
ordered
twice
a
week
to
strip
clean
and
bathe
themselves
in
the
sea
but
notwithstanding
all
the
precautions
of
discipline
they
swarm
with
vermin
and
the
vessel
smells
like
an
hospital
or
crouded
jail
they
seem
nevertheless
quite
insensible
of
their
misery
like
so
many
convicts
in
newgate
they
laugh
and
sing
and
swear
and
get
drunk
when
they
can
when
you
enter
by
the
stern
you
are
welcomed
by
a
band
of
music
selected
from
the
slaves
and
these
expect
a
gratification
if
you
walk
forwards
you
must
take
care
of
your
pockets
you
will
be
accosted
by
one
or
other
of
the
slaves
with
a
brush
and
for
cleaning
your
shoes
and
if
you
undergo
this
operation
it
is
ten
to
one
but
your
pocket
is
picked
if
you
decline
his
service
and
keep
aloof
you
will
find
it
almost
impossible
to
avoid
a
colony
of
vermin
which
these
fellows
have
a
very
dexterous
method
of
conveying
to
strangers
some
of
the
turkish
prisoners
whose
ransom
or
exchange
is
expected
are
allowed
to
go
ashore
under
proper
inspection
and
those
forcats
who
have
served
the
best
part
of
the
time
for
which
they
were
condemned
are
employed
in
public
works
under
a
guard
of
soldiers
at
the
harbour
of
nice
they
are
hired
by
to
bring
ballast
and
have
a
small
proportion
of
what
they
earn
for
their
own
use
the
rest
belongs
to
the
king
they
are
distinguished
by
an
iron
shackle
about
one
of
their
legs
the
road
from
nice
to
ville
franche
is
scarce
passable
on
horseback
a
circumstance
the
more
extraordinary
as
those
slaves
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
months
might
even
make
it
fit
for
a
carriage
and
the
king
would
not
be
one
farthing
out
of
pocket
for
they
are
quite
idle
the
greatest
part
of
the
year
the
gallies
go
to
sea
only
in
the
summer
in
tempestuous
weather
they
could
not
live
out
of
port
indeed
they
are
good
for
nothing
but
in
smooth
water
during
a
calm
when
by
dint
of
rowing
they
make
good
way
the
king
of
sardinia
is
so
sensible
of
their
inutility
that
he
intends
to
let
his
gallies
rot
and
in
lieu
of
them
has
purchased
two
large
frigates
in
england
one
of
fifty
and
another
of
thirty
guns
which
are
now
in
the
harbour
of
ville
franche
he
has
also
procured
an
english
officer
one
a
who
is
second
in
command
on
board
of
one
of
them
and
has
the
title
of
captain
consulteur
that
is
instructor
to
the
first
captain
the
marquis
de
m
i
who
knows
as
little
of
seamanship
as
i
do
of
arabic
the
king
it
is
said
intends
to
have
two
or
three
more
frigates
and
then
he
will
be
more
than
a
match
for
the
barbary
corsairs
provided
care
be
taken
to
man
his
fleet
in
a
proper
manner
but
this
will
never
be
done
unless
he
invites
foreigners
into
his
service
officers
as
well
as
seamen
for
his
own
dominions
produce
neither
at
present
if
he
is
really
determined
to
make
the
most
of
the
maritime
situation
of
his
dominions
as
well
as
of
his
alliance
with
he
ought
to
supply
his
ships
with
english
mariners
and
put
a
british
commander
at
the
head
of
his
fleet
he
ought
to
erect
magazines
and
docks
at
villa
franca
or
if
there
is
not
conveniency
for
building
he
may
at
least
have
pits
and
wharfs
for
heaving
down
and
careening
and
these
ought
to
be
under
the
direction
of
englishmen
who
best
understand
all
the
particulars
of
marine
oeconomy
without
all
doubt
he
will
not
be
able
to
engage
foreigners
without
giving
them
liberal
appointments
and
their
being
engaged
in
his
service
will
give
umbrage
to
his
own
subjects
but
when
the
business
is
to
establish
a
maritime
power
these
considerations
ought
to
be
sacrificed
to
reasons
of
public
utility
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
and
unreasonable
than
the
murmurs
of
the
piedmontese
officers
at
the
preferment
of
foreigners
who
execute
those
things
for
the
advantage
of
their
country
of
which
they
know
themselves
incapable
when
p
n
was
first
promoted
in
the
service
of
his
sardinian
majesty
he
met
with
great
opposition
and
numberless
mortifications
from
the
jealousy
of
the
piedmontese
officers
and
was
obliged
to
hazard
his
life
in
many
rencounters
with
them
before
they
would
be
quiet
being
a
man
of
uncommon
spirit
he
never
suffered
the
least
insult
or
affront
to
pass
unchastised
he
had
repeated
opportunities
of
signalizing
his
valour
against
the
turks
and
by
dint
of
extraordinary
merit
and
long
services
not
only
attained
the
chief
command
of
the
gallies
with
the
rank
of
but
also
acquired
a
very
considerable
share
of
the
king
favour
and
was
appointed
commandant
of
nice
his
sardinian
majesty
found
his
account
more
ways
than
one
in
thus
promoting
p
he
made
the
acquisition
of
an
excellent
officer
of
tried
courage
and
fidelity
by
whose
advice
he
conducted
his
marine
affairs
this
gentleman
was
perfectly
well
esteemed
at
the
court
of
london
in
the
war
of
he
lived
in
the
utmost
harmony
with
the
british
admirals
who
commanded
our
fleet
in
the
mediterranean
in
consequence
of
this
good
understanding
a
thousand
occasional
services
were
performed
by
the
english
ships
for
the
benefit
of
his
master
which
otherwise
could
not
have
been
done
without
a
formal
application
to
our
ministry
in
which
case
the
opportunities
would
have
been
lost
i
know
our
admirals
had
general
orders
and
instructions
to
cooperate
in
all
things
with
his
sardinian
majesty
but
i
know
also
by
experience
how
little
these
general
instructions
avail
when
the
admiral
is
not
cordially
interested
in
the
service
were
the
king
of
sardinia
at
present
engaged
with
england
in
a
new
war
against
france
and
a
british
squadron
stationed
upon
this
coast
as
formerly
he
would
find
a
great
difference
in
this
particular
he
should
therefore
carefully
avoid
having
at
nice
a
savoyard
commandant
utterly
ignorant
of
sea
affairs
unacquainted
with
the
true
interest
of
his
master
proud
and
arbitrary
reserved
to
strangers
from
a
prejudice
of
national
jealousy
and
particularly
averse
to
the
english
with
respect
to
the
antient
name
of
villa
franca
there
is
a
dispute
among
antiquarians
it
is
not
at
all
mentioned
in
the
itinerarium
of
antoninus
unless
it
is
meant
as
the
port
of
nice
but
it
is
more
surprising
that
the
accurate
strabo
in
describing
this
coast
mentions
no
such
harbour
some
people
imagine
it
is
the
portus
herculis
monaeci
but
this
is
undoubtedly
what
is
now
called
monaco
the
harbour
of
which
exactly
tallies
with
what
strabo
says
of
the
portus
monaeci
neque
magnas
neque
multas
capit
naves
it
holds
but
a
few
vessels
and
those
of
small
burthen
ptolomy
indeed
seems
to
mention
it
under
the
name
of
herculis
portus
different
from
the
portus
monaeci
his
words
are
these

the

and
monaco
in
that
case
hercules
was
worshipped
both
here
and
at
monaco
and
gave
his
name
to
both
places
but
on
this
subject
i
shall
perhaps
speak
more
fully
in
another
letter
after
i
have
seen
the
trophaea

now
called
tourbia
and
the
town
of

last
is
about
three
leagues
from
nice
here
i
can
not
help
taking
notice
of
the
following
elegant
description
from
the

which
seems
to
have
been
intended
for
this

in
your

you
remind
me
of
my
promise
to
communicate
the
remarks
i
have
still
to
make
on
the
french
nation
and
at
the
same
time
you
signify
your
opinion
that
i
am
too
severe
in
my
former
observations
you
even
hint
a
suspicion
that
this
severity
is
owing
to
some
personal
cause
of
resentment
but
i
protest
i
have
no
particular
cause
of
animosity
against
any
individual
of
that
country
i
have
neither
obligation
to
nor
quarrel
with
any
subject
of
france
and
when
i
meet
with
a
frenchman
worthy
of
my
esteem
i
can
receive
him
into
my
friendship
with
as
much
cordiality
as
i
could
feel
for
any
of
the
same
merit
i
even
respect
the
nation
for
the
number
of
great
men
it
has
produced
in
all
arts
and
sciences
i
respect
the
french
officers
in
particular
for
their
gallantry
and
valour
and
especially
for
that
generous
humanity
which
they
exercise
towards
their
enemies
even
amidst
the
horrors
of
war
this
liberal
spirit
is
the
only
circumstance
of
antient
chivalry
which
i
think
was
worth
preserving
it
had
formerly
flourished
in
england
but
was
almost
extinguished
in
a
succession
of
civil
wars
which
are
always
productive
of
cruelty
and
rancour
it
was
henry
iv
of
france
a
real
knight
errant
who
revived
it
in
europe
he
possessed
that
greatness
of
mind
which
can
forgive
injuries
of
the
deepest
dye
and
as
he
had
also
the
faculty
of
distinguishing
characters
he
found
his
account
in
favouring
with
his
friendship
and
confidence
some
of
those
who
had
opposed
him
in
the
field
with
the
most
inveterate
perseverance
i
know
not
whether
he
did
more
service
to
mankind
in
general
by
reviving
the
practice
of
treating
his
prisoners
with
generosity
than
he
prejudiced
his
own
country
by
patronizing
the
absurd
and
pernicious
custom
of
duelling
and
establishing
a
punto
founded
in
diametrical
opposition
to
common
sense
and
humanity
i
have
often
heard
it
observed
that
a
french
officer
is
generally
an
agreeable
companion
when
he
is
turned
of
fifty
without
all
doubt
by
that
time
the
fire
of
his
vivacity
which
makes
him
so
troublesome
in
his
youth
will
be
considerably
abated
and
in
other
respects
he
must
be
improved
by
his
experience
but
there
is
a
fundamental
error
in
the
first
principles
of
his
education
which
time
rather
confirms
than
removes
early
prejudices
are
for
the
most
part
converted
into
habits
of
thinking
and
accordingly
you
will
find
the
old
officers
in
the
french
service
more
bigotted
than
their
juniors
to
the
punctilios
of
false
honour
a
lad
of
a
good
family
no
sooner
enters
into
the
service
than
he
thinks
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
shew
his
courage
in
a
rencontre
his
natural
vivacity
prompts
him
to
hazard
in
company
every
thing
that
comes
uppermost
without
any
respect
to
his
seniors
or
betters
and
ten
to
one
but
he
says
something
which
he
finds
it
necessary
to
maintain
with
his
sword
the
old
officer
instead
of
checking
his
petulance
either
by
rebuke
or
silent
disapprobation
seems
to
be
pleased
with
his
impertinence
and
encourages
every
sally
of
his
presumption
should
a
quarrel
ensue
and
the
parties
go
out
he
makes
no
efforts
to
compromise
the
dispute
but
sits
with
a
pleasing
expectation
to
learn
the
issue
of
the
rencontre
if
the
young
man
is
wounded
he
kisses
him
with
transport
extols
his
bravery
puts
him
into
the
hands
of
the
surgeon
and
visits
him
with
great
tenderness
every
day
until
he
is
cured
if
he
is
killed
on
the
spot
he
shrugs
up
his
shoulders
says
quelle
dommage
un
amiable
enfant
ah
patience
what
pity
he
was
a
fine
boy
it
ca
be
helpt
and
in
three
hours
the
defunct
is
forgotten
you
know
in
france
duels
are
forbid
on
pain
of
death
but
this
law
is
easily
evaded
the
person
insulted
walks
out
the
antagonist
understands
the
hint
and
follows
him
into
the
street
where
they
justle
as
if
by
accident
draw
their
swords
and
one
of
them
is
either
killed
or
disabled
before
any
effectual
means
can
be
used
to
part
them
whatever
may
be
the
issue
of
the
combat
the
magistrate
takes
no
cognizance
of
it
at
least
it
is
interpreted
into
an
accidental
rencounter
and
no
penalty
is
incurred
on
either
side
thus
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
entirely
defeated
by
a
most
ridiculous
and
cruel
connivance
the
meerest
trifles
in
conversation
a
rash
word
a
distant
hint
even
a
look
or
smile
of
contempt
is
sufficient
to
produce
one
of
these
combats
but
injuries
of
a
deeper
dye
such
as
terms
of
reproach
the
lie
direct
a
blow
or
even
the
menace
of
a
blow
must
be
discussed
with
more
formality
in
any
of
these
cases
the
parties
agree
to
meet
in
the
dominions
of
another
prince
where
they
can
murder
each
other
without
fear
of
punishment
an
officer
who
is
struck
or
even
threatened
with
a
blow
must
not
be
quiet
until
he
either
kills
his
antagonist
or
loses
his
own
life
a
friend
of
mine
a
nissard
who
was
in
the
service
of
france
told
me
that
some
years
ago
one
of
their
captains
in
the
heat
of
passion
struck
his
lieutenant
they
fought
immediately
the
lieutenant
was
wounded
and
disarmed
as
it
was
an
affront
that
could
not
be
made
up
he
no
sooner
recovered
of
his
wounds
than
he
called
out
the
captain
a
second
time
in
a
word
they
fought
five
times
before
the
combat
proved
decisive
at
last
the
lieutenant
was
left
dead
on
the
spot
this
was
an
event
which
sufficiently
proved
the
absurdity
of
the
punctilio
that
gave
rise
to
it
the
poor
gentleman
who
was
insulted
and
outraged
by
the
brutality
of
the
aggressor
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
giving
him
a
further
occasion
to
take
away
his
life
another
adventure
of
the
same
kind
happened
a
few
years
ago
in
this
place
a
french
officer
having
threatened
to
strike
another
a
formal
challenge
ensued
and
it
being
agreed
that
they
should
fight
until
one
of
them
dropped
each
provided
himself
with
a
couple
of
pioneers
to
dig
his
grave
on
the
spot
they
engaged
just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
nice
in
presence
of
a
great
number
of
spectators
and
fought
with
surprising
fury
until
the
ground
was
drenched
with
their
blood
at
length
one
of
them
stumbled
and
fell
upon
which
the
other
who
found
himself
mortally
wounded
advancing
and
dropping
his
point
said
je
te
donne
ce
que
tu
ote
i
give
thee
that
which
thou
hast
taken
from
me
so
saying
he
dropped
dead
upon
the
field
the
other
who
had
been
the
person
insulted
was
so
dangerously
wounded
that
he
could
not
rise
some
of
the
spectators
carried
him
forthwith
to
the
beach
and
putting
him
into
a
boat
conveyed
him
by
sea
to
antibes
the
body
of
his
antagonist
was
denied
christian
burial
as
he
died
without
absolution
and
every
body
allowed
that
his
soul
went
to
hell
but
the
gentlemen
of
the
army
declared
that
he
died
like
a
man
of
honour
should
a
man
be
never
so
well
inclined
to
make
atonement
in
a
peaceable
manner
for
an
insult
given
in
the
heat
of
passion
or
in
the
fury
of
intoxication
it
can
not
be
received
even
an
involuntary
trespass
from
ignorance
or
absence
of
mind
must
be
cleansed
with
blood
a
certain
noble
lord
of
our
country
when
he
was
yet
a
commoner
on
his
travels
involved
himself
in
a
dilemma
of
this
sort
at
the
court
of
lorrain
he
had
been
riding
out
and
strolling
along
a
public
walk
in
a
brown
study
with
his
in
his
hand
perceived
a
caterpillar
crawling
on
the
back
of
a
marquis
who
chanced
to
be
before
him
he
never
thought
of
the
petit
maitre
but
lifting
up
his
whip
in
order
to
kill
the
insect
laid
it
across
his
shoulders
with
a
crack
that
alarmed
all
the
company
in
the
walk
the
marquis
sword
was
produced
in
a
moment
and
the
aggressor
in
great
hazard
of
his
life
as
he
had
no
weapon
of
defence
he
was
no
sooner
waked
from
his
reverie
than
he
begged
pardon
and
offered
to
make
all
proper
concessions
for
what
he
had
done
through
mere
inadvertency
the
marquis
would
have
admitted
his
excuses
had
there
been
any
precedent
of
such
an
affront
being
washed
away
without
blood
a
conclave
of
honour
was
immediately
assembled
and
after
long
disputes
they
agreed
that
an
involuntary
offence
especially
from
such
a
kind
of
man
tel
homme
might
be
attoned
by
concessions
that
you
may
have
some
idea
of
the
small
beginning
from
which
many
gigantic
quarrels
arise
i
shall
recount
one
that
lately
happened
at
lyons
as
i
had
it
from
the
mouth
of
a
person
who
was
an
ear
and
eye
witness
of
the
transaction
two
frenchmen
at
a
public
ordinary
stunned
the
rest
of
the
company
with
their
loquacity
at
length
one
of
them
with
a
supercilious
air
asked
the
other
name
i
never
tell
my
name
said
he
but
in
a
whisper
you
may
have
very
good
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
replied
the
first
i
will
tell
you
resumed
the
other
with
these
words
he
rose
and
going
round
to
him
pronounced
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
whole
company
je
pierre
paysan
et
vous
etes
un
impertinent
my
name
is
peter
peasant
and
you
are
an
impertinent
fellow
so
saying
he
walked
out
the
interrogator
followed
him
into
the
street
where
they
justled
drew
their
swords
and
engaged
he
who
asked
the
question
was
run
through
the
body
but
his
relations
were
so
powerful
that
the
victor
was
obliged
to
fly
his
country
was
tried
and
condemned
in
his
absence
his
goods
were
confiscated
his
wife
broke
her
heart
his
children
were
reduced
to
beggary
and
he
himself
is
now
starving
in
exile
in
england
we
have
not
yet
adopted
all
the
implacability
of
the
punctilio
a
gentleman
may
be
insulted
even
with
a
blow
and
survive
after
having
once
hazarded
his
life
against
the
aggressor
the
laws
of
honour
in
our
country
do
not
oblige
him
either
to
slay
the
person
from
whom
he
received
the
injury
or
even
to
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
his
own
blood
one
finds
no
examples
of
duels
among
the
romans
who
were
certainly
as
brave
and
as
delicate
in
their
notions
of
honour
as
the
french
cornelius
nepos
tells
us
that
a
famous
athenian
general
having
a
dispute
with
his
colleague
who
was
of
sparta
a
man
of
a
fiery
disposition
this
last
lifted
up
his
cane
to
strike
him
had
this
happened
to
a
french
petit
maitre
death
must
have
ensued
but
mark
what
followed
the
athenian
far
from
resenting
the
outrage
in
what
is
now
called
a
gentlemanlike
manner
said
do
strike
if
you
please
but
hear
me
he
never
dreamed
of
cutting
the
lacedemonian
throat
but
bore
with
his
passionate
temper
as
the
infirmity
of
a
friend
who
had
a
thousand
good
qualities
to
overbalance
that
defect
i
need
not
expatiate
upon
the
folly
and
the
mischief
which
are
countenanced
and
promoted
by
the
modern
practice
of
duelling
i
need
not
give
examples
of
friends
who
have
murdered
each
other
in
obedience
to
this
savage
custom
even
while
their
hearts
were
melting
with
mutual
tenderness
nor
will
i
particularize
the
instances
which
i
myself
know
of
whole
families
ruined
of
women
and
children
made
widows
and
orphans
of
parents
deprived
of
only
sons
and
of
valuable
lives
lost
to
the
community
by
duels
which
had
been
produced
by
one
unguarded
expression
uttered
without
intention
of
offence
in
the
heat
of
dispute
and
altercation
i
shall
not
insist
upon
the
hardship
of
a
worthy
man
being
obliged
to
devote
himself
to
death
because
it
is
his
misfortune
to
be
insulted
by
a
brute
a
bully
a
drunkard
or
a
madman
neither
will
i
enlarge
upon
this
side
of
the
absurdity
which
indeed
amounts
to
a
contradiction
in
terms
i
mean
the
dilemma
to
which
a
gentleman
in
the
army
is
reduced
when
he
receives
an
affront
if
he
does
not
challenge
and
fight
his
antagonist
he
is
broke
with
infamy
by
a
if
he
fights
and
kills
him
he
is
tried
by
the
civil
power
convicted
of
murder
and
if
the
royal
mercy
does
not
interpose
he
is
infallibly
hanged
all
this
exclusive
of
the
risque
of
his
own
life
in
the
duel
and
his
conscience
being
burthened
with
the
blood
of
a
man
whom
perhaps
he
has
sacrificed
to
a
false
punctilio
even
contrary
to
his
own
judgment
these
are
reflections
which
i
know
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
but
i
will
make
bold
to
propose
a
remedy
for
this
gigantic
evil
which
seems
to
gain
ground
everyday
let
a
court
be
instituted
for
taking
cognizance
of
all
breaches
of
honour
with
power
to
punish
by
fine
pillory
sentence
of
infamy
outlawry
and
exile
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
parliament
made
for
this
purpose
and
all
persons
insulted
shall
have
recourse
to
this
tribunal
let
every
man
who
seeks
personal
reparation
with
sword
pistol
or
other
instrument
of
death
be
declared
infamous
and
banished
the
kingdom
let
every
man
convicted
of
having
used
a
sword
or
pistol
or
other
mortal
weapon
against
another
either
in
duel
or
rencountre
occasioned
by
any
previous
quarrel
be
subject
to
the
same
penalties
if
any
man
is
killed
in
a
duel
let
his
body
be
hanged
upon
a
public
gibbet
for
a
certain
time
and
then
given
to
the
surgeons
let
his
antagonist
be
hanged
as
a
murderer
and
dissected
also
and
some
mark
of
infamy
be
set
on
the
memory
of
both
i
apprehend
such
regulations
would
put
an
effectual
stop
to
the
practice
of
duelling
which
nothing
but
the
fear
of
infamy
can
support
for
i
am
persuaded
that
no
being
capable
of
reflection
would
prosecute
the
trade
of
assassination
at
the
risque
of
his
own
life
if
this
hazard
was
at
the
same
time
reinforced
by
the
certain
prospect
of
infamy
and
ruin
every
person
of
sentiment
would
in
that
case
allow
that
an
officer
who
in
a
duel
robs
a
deserving
woman
of
her
husband
a
number
of
children
of
their
father
a
family
of
its
support
and
the
community
of
a
has
as
little
merit
to
plead
from
exposing
his
own
person
as
a
highwayman
or
housebreaker
who
every
day
risques
his
life
to
rob
or
plunder
that
which
is
not
of
half
the
importance
to
society
i
think
it
was
from
the
buccaneers
of
america
that
the
english
have
learned
to
abolish
one
solecism
in
the
practice
of
duelling
those
adventurers
decided
their
personal
quarrels
with
pistols
and
this
improvement
has
been
adopted
in
great
britain
with
good
success
though
in
france
and
other
parts
of
the
continent
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
proof
of
their
barbarity
it
is
however
the
only
circumstance
of
duelling
which
savours
of
common
sense
as
it
puts
all
mankind
upon
a
level
the
old
with
the
young
the
weak
with
the
strong
the
unwieldy
with
the
nimble
and
the
man
who
knows
not
how
to
hold
a
sword
with
the
spadassin
who
has
practised
fencing
from
the
cradle
what
glory
is
there
in
a
man
vanquishing
an
adversary
over
whom
he
has
a
manifest
advantage
to
abide
the
issue
of
a
combat
in
this
case
does
not
even
require
that
moderate
share
of
resolution
which
nature
has
indulged
to
her
common
children
accordingly
we
have
seen
many
instances
of
a
coward
provoking
a
man
of
honour
to
battle
in
the
reign
of
our
second
charles
when
duels
flourished
in
all
their
absurdity
and
the
seconds
fought
while
their
principals
were
engaged
villiers
duke
of
buckingham
not
content
with
having
debauched
the
countess
of
shrewsbury
and
publishing
her
shame
took
all
opportunities
of
provoking
the
earl
to
single
combat
hoping
he
should
have
an
easy
conquest
his
lordship
being
a
puny
little
creature
quiet
inoffensive
and
every
way
unfit
for
such
personal
contests
he
ridiculed
him
on
all
occasions
and
at
last
declared
in
public
company
that
there
was
no
glory
in
cuckolding
shrewsbury
who
had
not
spirit
to
resent
the
injury
this
was
an
insult
which
could
not
be
overlooked
the
earl
sent
him
a
challenge
and
they
agreed
to
fight
at
in
presence
of
two
gentlemen
whom
they
chose
for
their
seconds
all
the
four
engaged
at
the
same
time
the
first
thrust
was
fatal
to
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
and
his
friend
killed
the
second
at
the
same
instant
buckingham
elated
with
his
exploit
set
out
immediately
for
the
earl
seat
at
cliefden
where
he
lay
with
his
wife
after
having
boasted
of
the
murder
of
her
husband
whose
blood
he
shewed
her
upon
his
sword
as
a
trophy
of
his
prowess
but
this
very
duke
of
buckingham
was
little
better
than
a
poltroon
at
bottom
when
the
gallant
earl
of
ossory
challenged
him
to
fight
in
chelsea
fields
he
crossed
the
water
to
battersea
where
he
pretended
to
wait
for
his
lordship
and
then
complained
to
the
house
of
lords
that
ossory
had
given
him
the
rendezvous
and
did
not
keep
his
appointment
he
knew
the
house
would
interpose
in
the
quarrel
and
he
was
not
disappointed
their
lordships
obliged
them
both
to
give
their
word
of
honour
that
their
quarrel
should
have
no
other
consequences
i
ought
to
make
an
apology
for
having
troubled
a
lady
with
so
many
observations
on
a
subject
so
unsuitable
to
the
softness
of
the
fair
sex
but
i
know
you
can
not
be
indifferent
to
any
thing
that
so
nearly
affects
the
interests
of
humanity
which
i
can
safely
aver
have
alone
suggested
every
thing
which
has
been
said
by
madam
your
very
humble
servant
letter
xvi
nice
may
dear
doctor
a
few
days
ago
i
rode
out
with
two
gentlemen
of
this
country
to
see
a
stream
of
water
which
was
formerly
conveyed
in
an
aqueduct
to
the
antient
city
of
cemenelion
from
whence
this
place
is
distant
about
a
mile
though
separated
by
abrupt
rocks
and
deep
hollows
which
last
are
here
honoured
with
the
name
of
vallies
the
water
which
is
exquisitely
cool
and
light
and
pure
gushes
from
the
middle
of
a
rock
by
a
hole
which
leads
to
a
subterranean
aqueduct
carried
through
the
middle
of
the
mountain
this
is
a
roman
work
and
the
more
i
considered
it
appeared
the
more
stupendous
a
peasant
who
lives
upon
the
spot
told
us
he
had
entered
by
this
hole
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
advanced
so
far
that
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
before
he
came
out
he
said
he
walked
in
the
water
through
a
regular
canal
formed
of
a
hard
stone
lined
with
a
kind
of
cement
and
vaulted
overhead
but
so
high
in
most
parts
he
could
stand
upright
yet
in
others
the
bed
of
the
canal
was
so
filled
with
earth
and
stones
that
he
was
obliged
to
stoop
in
passing
he
said
that
there
were
at
certain
distances
and
indeed
i
saw
one
of
these
not
far
from
the
present
issue
that
there
were
some
openings
and
stone
seats
on
the
sides
and
here
and
there
figures
of
men
formed
of
stone
with
hammers
and
working
tools
in
their
hands
i
am
apt
to
believe
the
fellow
romanced
a
little
in
order
to
render
his
adventure
the
more
marvellous
but
i
am
certainly
informed
that
several
persons
have
entered
this
passage
and
proceeded
a
considerable
way
by
the
light
of
torches
without
arriving
at
the
source
which
if
we
may
believe
the
tradition
of
the
country
is
at
the
distance
of
eight
leagues
from
this
opening
but
this
is
altogether
incredible
the
stream
is
now
called
la
fontaine
de
muraille
and
is
carefully
conducted
by
different
branches
into
the
adjacent
vineyards
and
gardens
for
watering
the
ground
on
the
side
of
the
same
mountain
more
southerly
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
there
is
another
still
more
copious
discharge
of
the
same
kind
of
water
called
la
source
du
temple
it
was
conveyed
through
the
same
kind
of
passage
and
put
to
the
same
use
as
the
other
and
i
should
imagine
they
are
both
from
the
same
source
which
though
hitherto
undiscovered
must
be
at
a
considerable
distance
as
the
mountain
is
continued
for
several
leagues
to
the
westward
without
exhibiting
the
least
signs
of
water
in
any
other
part
but
exclusive
of
the
subterranean
conduits
both
these
streams
must
have
been
conveyed
through
aqueducts
extending
from
hence
to
cemenelion
over
steep
rocks
and
deep
ravines
at
a
prodigious
expence
the
water
from
this
source
du
temple
issues
from
a
stone
building
which
covers
the
passage
in
the
rock
it
serves
to
turn
several
olive
corn
and
paper
mills
being
conveyed
through
a
modern
aqueduct
raised
upon
paultry
arcades
at
the
expence
of
the
public
and
afterwards
is
branched
off
in
very
small
streams
for
the
benefit
of
this
parched
and
barren
country
the
romans
were
so
used
to
bathing
that
they
could
not
exist
without
a
great
quantity
of
water
and
this
i
imagine
is
one
reason
that
induced
them
to
spare
no
labour
and
expence
in
bringing
it
from
a
distance
when
they
had
not
plenty
of
it
at
home
but
besides
this
motive
they
had
another
they
were
so
nice
and
delicate
in
their
taste
of
water
that
they
took
great
pains
to
supply
themselves
with
the
purest
and
lightest
from
afar
for
drinking
and
culinary
uses
even
while
they
had
plenty
of
an
inferior
sort
for
their
bath
and
other
domestic
purposes
there
are
springs
of
good
water
on
the
spot
where
cemenelion
stood
but
there
is
a
hardness
in
all
which
quality
is
deposited
in
running
a
long
course
especially
if
exposed
to
the
influence
of
the
sun
and
air
the
romans
therefore
had
good
reason
to
soften
and
meliorate
this
element
by
conveying
it
a
good
length
of
way
in
open
aqueducts
what
was
used
in
the
baths
of
cemenelion
they
probably
brought
in
leaden
pipes
some
of
which
have
been
dug
up
very
lately
by
accident
you
must
know
i
made
a
second
excursion
to
these
antient
ruins
and
measured
the
arena
of
the
amphitheatre
with
packthread
it
is
an
oval
figure
the
longest
diameter
extending
to
about
one
hundred
and
thirteen
feet
and
the
shortest
to
but
i
will
not
answer
for
the
exactness
of
the
measurement
in
the
center
of
it
there
was
a
square
stone
with
an
iron
ring
to
which
i
suppose
the
wild
beasts
were
tied
to
prevent
their
springing
upon
the
spectators
some
of
the
seats
remain
the
two
opposite
entrances
consisting
each
of
one
large
gate
and
two
lateral
smaller
doors
arched
there
is
also
a
considerable
portion
of
the
external
wall
but
no
columns
or
other
ornaments
of
architecture
hard
by
in
the
garden
of
the
count
de
gubernatis
i
saw
the
remains
of
a
bath
fronting
the
portal
of
the
temple
which
i
have
described
in
a
former
letter
and
here
were
some
shafts
of
marble
pillars
particularly
a
capital
of
the
corinthian
order
beautifully
cut
of
white
alabaster
here
the
count
found
a
large
quantity
of
fine
marble
which
he
has
converted
to
various
uses
and
some
mutilated
statues
bronze
as
well
as
marble
the
peasant
shewed
me
some
brass
and
silver
medals
which
he
has
picked
up
at
different
times
in
labouring
the
ground
together
with
several
oblong
beads
of
coloured
glass
which
were
used
as
by
the
roman
ladies
and
a
small
seal
of
agate
very
much
defaced
two
of
the
medals
were
of
maximian
and
gallienus
the
rest
were
so
consumed
that
i
could
not
read
the
legend
you
know
that
on
public
occasions
such
as
games
and
certain
sacrifices
handfuls
of
medals
were
thrown
among
the
people
a
practice
which
accounts
for
the
great
number
which
have
been
already
found
in
this
district
i
saw
some
subterranean
passages
which
seemed
to
have
been
common
sewers
and
a
great
number
of
old
walls
still
standing
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
which
overhangs
the
paglion
the
peasants
tell
me
that
they
never
dig
above
a
yard
in
depth
without
finding
vaults
or
cavities
all
the
vineyards
and
for
a
considerable
extent
are
vaulted
underneath
and
all
the
ground
that
produces
their
grapes
fruit
and
is
no
more
than
the
crumpled
lime
and
rubbish
of
old
roman
buildings
mixed
with
manure
brought
from
nice
this
antient
town
commanded
a
most
noble
prospect
of
the
sea
but
is
altogether
inaccessible
by
any
kind
of
wheel
carriage
if
you
make
shift
to
climb
to
it
on
horseback
you
can
not
descend
to
the
plain
again
without
running
the
risk
of
breaking
your
neck
about
seven
or
eight
miles
on
the
other
side
of
nice
are
the
remains
of
another
roman
monument
which
has
greatly
suffered
from
the
barbarity
of
successive
ages
it
was
a
trophy
erected
by
the
senate
of
rome
in
honour
of
augustus
caesar
when
he
had
totally
subdued
all
the
ferocious
nations
of
these
maritime
alps
such
as
the
trumpilini
camuni
vennontes
isnarci
breuni
etc
it
stands
upon
the
top
of
a
mountain
which
overlooks
the
town
of
monaco
and
now
exhibits
the
appearance
of
an
old
ruined
tower
there
is
a
description
of
what
it
was
in
an
italian
manuscript
by
which
it
appears
to
have
been
a
beautiful
edifice
of
two
stories
adorned
with
columns
and
trophies
in
with
a
statue
of
augustus
caesar
on
the
top
on
one
of
the
sides
was
an
inscription
some
words
of
which
are
still
legible
upon
the
fragment
of
a
marble
found
close
to
the
old
building
but
the
whole
is
preserved
in
pliny

this

is
erected
by
the

of

to
the
emperor
caesar
augustus
son
of
the
divine
julius
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
his
imperial
dignity
and
in
the
eighteenth
of
his
tribunician
power
because
under
his
command
and
auspices
all
the
nations
of
the
alps
from
the
adriatic
to
the
tuscanian
sea
were
reduced
under
the
dominion
of
rome
the
alpine
nations
subdued
were
the
trumpelini
etc
pliny
however
is
mistaken
in
placing
this
inscription
on
a
trophy
near
the
augusta
praetoria
now
called
aosta
in
piedmont
where
indeed
there
is
a
triumphal
arch
but
no
inscription
this
noble
monument
of
antiquity
was
first
of
all
destroyed
by
fire
and
afterwards
in
gothic
times
converted
into
a
kind
of
fortification
the
marbles
belonging
to
it
were
either
employed
in
adorning
the
church
of
the
adjoining
village
which
is
still
called
turbia
a
corruption
of
trophaea
this
was
formerly
a
considerable
town
called
villa
martis
and
pretends
to
the
honour
of
having
given
birth
to
aulus
helvius
who
succeeded
commodus
as
emperor
of
rome
by
the
name
of
pertinax
which
he
acquired
from
his
obstinate
refusal
of
that
dignity
when
it
was
forced
upon
him
by
the
senate
you
know
this
man
though
of
very
low
birth
possessed
many
excellent
qualities
and
was
basely
murdered
by
the
praetorian
guards
at
the
instigation
of
didius
tulianus
for
my
part
i
could
never
read
without
emotion
that
celebrated
eulogium
of
the
senate
who
exclaimed
after
his
death
pertinace
imperante
securi
viximus
neminem
timuimus

we
lived
secure
and
were

of
nothing
under
the
government
of

our
affectionate
father
father
of
the
senate
father
to
all
the
children
of
virtue
or
converted
into
or
carried
off
to
be
preserved
in
one
or
two
churches
of
nice
at
present
the
work
has
the
appearance
of
a
ruinous
with
gothic
battlements
and
as
such
stands
undistinguished
by
those
who
travel
by
sea
from
hence
to
genoa
and
other
ports
of
italy
i
think
i
have
now
described
all
the
antiquities
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nice
except
some
catacombs
or
caverns
dug
in
a
rock
at
hospice
which
busching
in
his
geography
has
described
as
a
strong
town
and
seaport
though
in
fact
there
is
not
the
least
vestige
either
of
town
or
village
it
is
a
point
of
land
almost
opposite
to
the
tower
of
turbia
with
the
mountains
of
which
it
forms
a
bay
where
there
is
a
great
and
curious
fishery
of
the
tunny
fish
farmed
of
the
king
of
sardinia
upon
this
point
there
is
a
still
kept
in
repair
to
give
notice
to
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
in
case
any
barbary
corsairs
should
appear
on
the
coast
the
catacombs
were
in
all
probability
dug
in
former
times
as
places
of
retreat
for
the
inhabitants
upon
sudden
descents
of
the
saracens
who
greatly
infested
these
seas
for
several
successive
centuries
many
curious
persons
have
entered
them
and
proceeded
a
considerable
way
by
without
arriving
at
the
further
extremity
and
the
tradition
of
the
country
is
that
they
reach
as
far
as
the
ancient
city
of
cemenelion
but
this
is
an
idle
supposition
almost
as
ridiculous
as
that
which
ascribes
them
to
the
labour
and
ingenuity
of
the
fairies
they
consist
of
narrow
subterranean
passages
vaulted
with
stone
and
lined
with
cement
here
and
there
one
finds
detached
apartments
like
small
chambers
where
i
suppose
the
people
remained
concealed
till
the
danger
was
over
diodorus
siculus
tells
us
that
the
antient
inhabitants
of
this
country
usually
lived
under
ground
ligures
in
terra
cubant
ut
plurimum
plures
ad
cava
saxa
speluncasque
ab
natura
factas
ubi
tegantur
corpora
divertunt
the
ligurians
mostly
lie
on
the
bare
ground
many
of
them
lodge
in
bare
caves
and
caverns
where
they
are
sheltered
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
this
was
likewise
the
custom
of
the
troglodytae
a
people
bordering
upon
aethiopia
who
according
to
aelian
lived
in
subterranean
caverns
from
whence
indeed
they
took
their
name
trogli
signifying
a
cavern
and
virgil
in
his
georgics
thus
describes
the
sarmatae
ipsi
in
defossis
specubus
secura
sub
alta
ocia
agunt
in
subterranean
caves
secure
they
lie
nor
heed
the
transient
seasons
as
they
fly
these
are
dry
subjects
but
such
as
the
country
affords
if
we
have
not
white
paper
we
must
snow
with
brown
even
that
which
i
am
now
scrawling
may
be
useful
if
not
entertaining
it
is
therefore
the
more
confidently
offered
by
dear
sir
yours
affectionately
letter
xvii
nice
july
dear
sir
nice
was
originally
a
colony
from
marseilles
you
know
the
phocians
if
we
may
believe
justin
and
polybius
settled
in
gaul
and
built
marseilles
during
the
reign
of
tarquinius
priscus
at
rome
this
city
flourished
to
such
a
degree
that
long
before
the
romans
were
in
a
condition
to
extend
their
dominion
it
sent
forth
colonies
and
established
them
along
the
coast
of
liguria
of
these
nice
or
nicaea
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
so
called
in
all
probability
from
the
greek
word
nike
signifying
victoria
in
consequence
of
some
important
victory
obtained
over
the
salii
and
ligures
who
were
the
antient
inhabitants
of
this
country
nice
with
its
mother
city
being
in
the
sequel
subdued
by
the
romans
fell
afterwards
successively
under
the
dominion
of
the
goths
burgundians
and
franks
the
kings
of
arles
and
the
kings
of
naples
as
counts
of
provence
in
the
year
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
the
city
and
county
of
nice
being
but
ill
protected
by
the
family
of
durazzo
voluntarily
surrendered
themselves
to
amadaeus
surnamed
the
red
duke
of
savoy
and
since
that
period
they
have
continued
as
part
of
that
potentate
dominions
except
at
such
times
as
they
have
been
and
possessed
by
the
power
of
france
which
hath
always
been
a
troublesome
neighbour
to
this
country
the
castle
was
begun
by
the
arragonian
counts
of
provence
and
afterwards
enlarged
by
several
successive
dukes
of
savoy
so
as
to
be
deemed
impregnable
until
the
modern
method
of
besieging
began
to
take
place
a
fruitless
attempt
was
made
upon
it
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
by
the
french
and
turks
in
conjunction
but
it
was
reduced
several
times
after
that
period
and
is
now
in
ruins
the
celebrated
engineer
vauban
being
commanded
by
louis
xiv
to
give
in
a
plan
for
fortifying
nice
proposed
that
the
river
paglion
should
be
turned
into
a
new
channel
so
as
to
surround
the
town
to
the
north
and
fall
into
the
harbour
that
where
the
paglion
now
runs
to
the
westward
of
the
city
walls
there
should
be
a
deep
ditch
to
be
filled
with
and
that
a
fortress
should
be
built
to
the
westward
of
this
fosse
these
particulars
might
be
executed
at
no
very
great
expence
but
i
apprehend
they
would
be
ineffectual
as
the
town
is
commanded
by
every
hill
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
exhalations
from
stagnating
would
infallibly
render
the
air
unwholesome
notwithstanding
the
undoubted
antiquity
of
nice
very
few
monuments
of
that
antiquity
now
remain
the
inhabitants
say
they
were
either
destroyed
by
the
saracens
in
their
successive
descents
upon
the
coast
by
the
barbarous
nations
in
their
repeated
incursions
or
used
in
fortifying
the
castle
as
well
as
in
building
other
edifices
the
city
of
cemenelion
however
was
subject
to
the
same
disasters
and
even
entirely
ruined
nevertheless
we
still
find
remains
of
its
antient
splendor
there
have
been
likewise
a
few
stones
found
at
nice
with
antient
inscriptions
but
there
is
nothing
of
this
kind
standing
unless
we
give
the
name
of
antiquity
to
a
marble
cross
on
the
road
to
provence
about
half
a
mile
from
the
city
it
stands
upon
a
pretty
high
pedestal
with
steps
under
a
pretty
stone
cupola
or
dome
supported
by
four
ionic
pillars
on
the
spot
where
charles
emperor
of
germany
francis
of
france
and
pope
paul
ii
agreed
to
have
a
conference
in
order
to
determine
all
their
disputes
the
emperor
came
hither
by
sea
with
a
powerful
fleet
and
the
french
king
by
land
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
army
all
the
endeavours
of
his
holiness
however
could
not
effect
a
peace
but
they
agreed
to
a
truce
of
ten
years
mezerai
affirms
that
these
two
great
princes
never
saw
one
another
on
this
occasion
and
that
this
shyness
was
owing
to
the
management
of
the
pope
whose
private
designs
might
have
been
frustrated
had
they
come
to
a
personal
interview
in
the
front
of
the
colonade
there
is
a
small
stone
with
an
inscription
in
latin
which
is
so
high
and
so
much
defaced
that
i
can
not
read
it
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
was
a
college
erected
at
nice
by
emanuel
philibert
duke
of
savoy
for
granting
degrees
to
students
of
law
and
in
the
year
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fourteen
charles
emanuel
instituted
the
senate
of
nice
consisting
of
a
president
and
a
certain
number
of
senators
who
are
distinguished
by
their
purple
robes
and
other
ensigns
of
authority
they
administer
justice
having
the
power
of
life
and
death
not
only
through
the
whole
county
of
nice
but
causes
are
evoked
from
oneglia
and
some
other
places
to
their
tribunal
which
is
the
dernier
ressort
from
whence
there
is
no
appeal
the
commandant
however
by
virtue
of
his
military
power
and
unrestricted
authority
takes
upon
him
to
punish
individuals
by
imprisonment
corporal
pains
and
banishment
without
consulting
the
senate
or
indeed
observing
any
form
of
trial
the
only
redress
against
any
unjust
exercise
of
this
absolute
power
is
by
complaint
to
the
king
and
you
know
what
chance
a
poor
man
has
for
being
redressed
in
this
manner
with
respect
to
religion
i
may
safely
say
that
here
superstition
reigns
under
the
darkest
shades
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
i
think
there
are
ten
convents
and
three
nunneries
within
and
without
the
walls
of
nice
and
among
them
all
i
never
could
hear
of
one
man
who
had
made
any
tolerable
advances
in
any
kind
of
human
learning
all
ecclesiastics
are
exempted
from
any
exertion
of
civil
power
being
under
the
immediate
protection
and
authority
of
the
bishop
or
his
vicar
the
bishop
of
nice
is
suffragan
of
the
archbishop
of
ambrun
in
france
and
the
revenues
of
the
see
amount
to
between
five
and
six
hundred
pounds
sterling
we
have
likewise
an
office
of
the
inquisition
though
i
do
not
hear
that
it
presumes
to
execute
any
acts
of
jurisdiction
without
the
king
special
permission
all
the
churches
are
sanctuaries
for
all
kinds
of
criminals
except
those
guilty
of
high
treason
and
the
priests
are
extremely
jealous
of
their
privileges
in
this
particular
they
receive
with
open
arms
murderers
robbers
smugglers
fraudulent
bankrupts
and
felons
of
every
denomination
and
never
give
them
up
until
after
having
stipulated
for
their
lives
and
liberty
i
need
not
enlarge
upon
the
pernicious
consequences
of
this
infamous
prerogative
calculated
to
raise
and
extend
the
power
and
influence
of
the
roman
church
on
the
ruins
of
morality
and
good
order
i
saw
a
fellow
who
had
three
days
before
murdered
his
wife
in
the
last
month
of
pregnancy
taking
the
air
with
great
composure
and
serenity
on
the
steps
of
a
church
in
florence
and
nothing
is
more
common
than
to
see
the
most
execrable
villains
diverting
themselves
in
the
cloysters
of
some
convents
at
rome
nice
abounds
with
noblesse
marquisses
counts
and
barons
of
these
three
or
four
families
are
really
respectable
the
rest
are
novi
homines
sprung
from
bourgeois
who
have
saved
a
little
money
by
their
different
occupations
and
raised
themselves
to
the
rank
of
noblesse
by
purchase
one
is
descended
from
an
avocat
another
from
an
apothecary
a
third
from
a
retailer
of
wine
a
fourth
from
a
dealer
in
anchovies
and
i
am
told
there
is
actually
a
count
at
villefranche
whose
father
sold
macaroni
in
the
streets
a
man
in
this
country
may
buy
a
marquisate
or
a
county
for
the
value
of
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
sterling
and
the
title
follows
the
fief
but
he
may
purchase
lettres
de
noblesse
for
about
thirty
or
forty
guineas
in
savoy
there
are
six
hundred
families
of
noblesse
the
greater
part
of
which
have
not
above
one
hundred
crowns
a
year
to
maintain
their
dignity
in
the
mountains
of
piedmont
and
even
in
this
country
of
nice
there
are
some
representatives
of
very
antient
and
noble
families
reduced
to
the
condition
of
common
peasants
but
they
still
retain
the
antient
pride
of
their
houses
and
boast
of
the
noble
blood
that
runs
in
their
veins
a
gentleman
told
me
that
in
travelling
through
the
mountains
he
was
obliged
to
pass
a
night
in
the
cottage
of
one
of
these
rusticated
nobles
who
called
to
his
son
in
the
evening
chevalier
donne
a
manger
aux
cochons
have
you
fed
the
hogs
sir
knight
this
however
is
not
the
case
with
the
noblesse
of
nice
two
or
three
of
them
have
about
four
or
five
hundred
a
year
the
rest
in
general
may
have
about
one
hundred
pistoles
arising
from
the
silk
oil
wine
and
oranges
produced
in
their
small
plantations
where
they
have
also
country
houses
some
few
of
these
are
well
built
commodious
and
situated
but
for
the
most
part
they
are
miserable
enough
our
noblesse
notwithstanding
their
origin
and
the
cheap
rate
at
which
their
titles
have
been
obtained
are
nevertheless
extremely
tenacious
of
their
privileges
very
delicate
in
maintaining
the
etiquette
and
keep
at
a
very
stately
distance
from
the
bourgeoisie
how
they
live
in
their
families
i
do
not
choose
to
enquire
but
in
public
madame
appears
in
her
robe
of
gold
or
silver
stuff
with
her
powder
and
frisure
her
perfumes
her
paint
and
her
patches
while
monsieur
le
comte
struts
about
in
his
lace
and
embroidery
rouge
and
fard
are
more
peculiarly
necessary
in
this
country
where
the
complexion
and
skin
are
naturally
swarthy
and
yellow
i
have
likewise
observed
that
most
of
the
females
are
a
circumstance
owing
i
believe
to
the
great
quantity
of
vegetable
trash
which
they
eat
all
the
horses
mules
asses
and
cattle
which
feed
upon
grass
have
the
same
distension
this
kind
of
food
produces
such
acid
juices
in
the
stomach
as
excite
a
perpetual
sense
of
hunger
i
have
been
often
amazed
at
the
voracious
appetites
of
these
people
you
must
not
expect
that
i
should
describe
the
tables
and
the
hospitality
of
our
nissard
gentry
our
consul
who
is
a
very
honest
man
told
me
he
had
lived
four
and
thirty
years
in
the
country
without
having
once
eat
or
drank
in
any
of
their
houses
the
noblesse
of
nice
can
not
leave
the
country
without
express
leave
from
the
king
and
this
leave
when
obtained
is
for
a
limited
time
which
they
dare
not
exceed
on
pain
of
incurring
his
displeasure
they
must
therefore
endeavour
to
find
amusements
at
home
and
this
i
apprehend
would
be
no
easy
task
for
people
of
an
active
spirit
or
restless
disposition
true
it
is
the
religion
of
the
country
supplies
a
fund
of
pastime
to
those
who
have
any
relish
for
devotion
and
this
is
here
a
prevailing
taste
we
have
had
transient
visits
of
a
strolling
musicians
and
but
they
did
not
like
their
quarters
and
decamped
without
beat
of
drum
in
the
summer
about
eight
or
nine
at
night
part
of
the
noblesse
may
be
seen
assembled
in
a
place
called
the
pare
which
is
indeed
a
sort
of
a
street
formed
by
a
row
of
very
paltry
houses
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
by
part
of
the
which
screens
it
from
a
prospect
of
the
sea
the
only
object
that
could
render
it
agreeable
here
you
may
perceive
the
noblesse
stretched
in
pairs
upon
logs
of
wood
like
so
many
seals
upon
the
rocks
by
each
dame
with
her
cicisbeo
for
you
must
understand
this
italian
fashion
prevails
at
nice
among
all
ranks
of
people
and
there
is
not
such
a
passion
as
jealousy
known
the
husband
and
the
cicisbeo
live
together
as
sworn
brothers
and
the
wife
and
the
mistress
embrace
each
other
with
marks
of
the
warmest
affection
i
do
not
choose
to
enter
into
particulars
i
can
not
open
the
scandalous
chronicle
of
nice
without
hazard
of
contamination
with
respect
to
delicacy
and
decorum
you
may
peruse
dean
swift
description
of
the
yahoos
and
then
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
porcheria
that
distinguishes
the
gallantry
of
nice
but
the
pare
is
not
the
only
place
of
public
resort
for
our
noblesse
in
a
summer
evening
just
without
one
of
our
gates
you
will
find
them
seated
in
ditches
on
the
highway
side
serenaded
with
the
croaking
of
frogs
and
the
bells
and
braying
of
mules
and
asses
continually
passing
in
a
perpetual
cloud
of
dust
besides
these
amusements
there
is
a
public
conversazione
every
evening
at
the
commandant
house
called
the
government
where
those
noble
personages
play
at
cards
for
farthings
in
carnival
time
there
is
also
at
this
same
government
a
ball
twice
or
thrice
a
week
carried
on
by
subscription
at
this
assembly
every
person
without
distinction
is
permitted
to
dance
in
masquerade
but
after
dancing
they
are
obliged
to
unmask
and
if
bourgeois
to
retire
no
individual
can
give
a
ball
without
obtaining
a
permission
and
guard
of
the
commandant
and
then
his
house
is
open
to
all
masques
without
distinction
who
are
provided
with
tickets
which
tickets
are
sold
by
the
commandant
secretary
at
five
sols
and
delivered
to
the
guard
at
the
door
if
i
have
a
mind
to
entertain
my
particular
friends
i
can
not
have
more
than
a
couple
of
violins
and
in
that
case
it
is
called
a
conversazione
though
the
king
of
sardinia
takes
all
opportunities
to
distinguish
the
subjects
of
with
particular
marks
of
respect
i
have
seen
enough
to
be
convinced
that
our
nation
is
looked
upon
with
an
evil
eye
by
the
people
of
nice
and
this
arises
partly
from
religious
prejudices
and
partly
from
envy
occasioned
by
a
ridiculous
notion
of
our
superior
wealth
for
my
own
part
i
owe
them
nothing
on
the
score
of
civilities
and
therefore
i
shall
say
nothing
more
on
the
subject
lest
i
should
be
tempted
to
deviate
from
that
temperance
and
impartiality
which
i
would
fain
hope
have
hitherto
characterised
the
remarks
of
dear
sir
your
faithful
humble
servant
letter
xviii
nice
september
dear
doctor
i
wrote
in
may
to
b
at
geneva
and
gave
him
what
information
he
desired
to
have
touching
the
conveniences
of
nice
i
shall
now
enter
into
the
same
detail
for
the
benefit
of
such
of
your
friends
or
patients
as
may
have
occasion
to
try
this
climate
the
journey
from
calais
to
nice
of
four
persons
in
a
coach
or
two
with
a
servant
on
horseback
travelling
post
may
be
performed
with
ease
for
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
including
every
expence
either
at
calais
or
at
paris
you
will
always
find
a
travelling
coach
or
berline
which
you
may
buy
for
thirty
or
forty
guineas
and
this
will
serve
very
well
to
reconvey
you
to
your
own
country
in
the
town
of
nice
you
will
find
no
lodgings
for
a
whole
family
just
without
one
of
the
gates
there
are
two
houses
to
be
let
for
about
five
per
month
as
for
the
country
houses
in
this
neighbourhood
they
are
damp
in
winter
and
generally
without
chimnies
and
in
summer
they
are
rendered
uninhabitable
by
the
heat
and
the
vermin
if
you
hire
a
tenement
in
nice
you
must
take
it
for
a
year
certain
and
this
will
cost
you
about
twenty
pounds
sterling
for
this
price
i
have
a
ground
floor
paved
with
brick
consisting
of
a
kitchen
two
large
halls
a
couple
of
good
rooms
with
chimnies
three
large
closets
that
serve
for
and
a
butler
room
and
three
apartments
for
servants
lumber
or
stores
to
which
we
ascend
by
narrow
wooden
stairs
i
have
likewise
two
small
gardens
well
stocked
with
oranges
lemons
peaches
figs
grapes
corinths
sallad
and
it
is
supplied
with
a
of
good
water
and
there
is
another
in
the
vestibule
of
the
house
which
is
cool
large
and
magnificent
you
may
hire
furniture
for
such
a
tenement
for
about
two
guineas
a
month
but
i
chose
rather
to
buy
what
was
necessary
and
this
cost
me
about
sixty
pounds
i
suppose
it
will
fetch
me
about
half
the
money
when
i
leave
the
place
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
tolerable
cook
at
nice
a
common
maid
who
serves
the
people
of
the
country
for
three
or
four
livres
a
month
will
not
live
with
an
english
family
under
eight
or
ten
they
are
all
slovenly
slothful
and
unconscionable
cheats
the
markets
at
nice
are
tolerably
well
supplied
their
beef
which
comes
from
piedmont
is
pretty
good
and
we
have
it
all
the
year
in
the
winter
we
have
likewise
excellent
pork
and
delicate
lamb
but
the
mutton
is
indifferent
piedmont
also
affords
us
delicious
capons
fed
with
maize
and
this
country
produces
excellent
turkeys
but
very
few
geese
chickens
and
pullets
are
extremely
meagre
i
have
tried
to
fatten
them
without
success
in
summer
they
are
subject
to
the
pip
and
die
in
great
numbers
autumn
and
winter
are
the
seasons
for
game
hares
partridges
quails
woodcocks
snipes
thrushes
beccaficas
and
ortolans
is
sometimes
found
in
the
mountains
it
has
a
delicious
taste
not
unlike
that
of
the
wild
hog
in
jamaica
and
would
make
an
excellent
barbecue
about
the
beginning
of
winter
when
it
is
in
good
case
but
when
meagre
the
head
only
is
presented
at
tables
pheasants
are
very
scarce
as
for
the
i
never
saw
but
one
cock
which
my
servant
bought
in
the
market
and
brought
home
but
the
commandant
cook
came
into
my
kitchen
and
carried
it
of
after
it
was
half
plucked
saying
his
master
had
company
to
dinner
the
hares
are
large
plump
and
juicy
the
partridges
are
generally
of
the
red
sort
large
as
pullets
and
of
a
good
flavour
there
are
also
some
grey
partridges
in
the
mountains
and
another
sort
of
a
white
colour
that
weigh
four
or
five
pounds
each
beccaficas
are
smaller
than
sparrows
but
very
fat
and
they
are
generally
eaten
half
raw
the
best
way
of
dressing
them
is
to
stuff
them
into
a
roll
scooped
of
it
crum
to
baste
them
well
with
butter
and
roast
them
until
they
are
brown
and
crisp
the
ortolans
are
kept
in
cages
and
crammed
until
they
die
of
fat
then
eaten
as
dainties
the
thrush
is
presented
with
the
trail
because
the
bird
feeds
on
olives
they
may
as
well
eat
the
trail
of
a
sheep
because
it
feeds
on
the
aromatic
herbs
of
the
mountain
in
the
summer
we
have
beef
veal
and
mutton
chicken
and
ducks
which
last
are
very
fat
and
very
flabby
all
the
meat
is
tough
in
this
season
because
the
excessive
heat
and
great
number
of
flies
will
not
admit
of
its
being
kept
any
time
after
it
is
killed
butter
and
milk
though
not
very
delicate
we
have
all
the
year
our
tea
and
fine
sugar
come
from
marseilles
at
a
very
reasonable
price
nice
is
not
without
variety
of
fish
though
they
are
not
counted
so
good
in
their
kinds
as
those
of
the
ocean
soals
and
in
general
are
scarce
here
are
some
mullets
both
grey
and
red
we
sometimes
see
the
dory
which
is
called
st
pierre
with
bonita
and
mackarel
the
gurnard
appears
pretty
often
and
there
is
plenty
of
a
kind
of
large
whiting
which
eats
pretty
well
but
has
not
the
delicacy
of
that
which
is
caught
on
our
coast
one
of
the
best
fish
of
this
country
is
called
le
loup
about
two
or
three
pounds
in
weight
white
firm
and
another
inferior
to
it
is
the
moustel
about
the
same
size
of
a
colour
and
short
blunt
snout
growing
thinner
and
flatter
from
the
shoulders
downwards
so
as
to
resemble
a
soal
at
the
tail
this
can
not
be
the
mustela
of
the
antients
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
sea
lamprey
here
too
are
found
the
vyvre
or
as
we
call
it
weaver
remarkable
for
its
long
sharp
spines
so
dangerous
to
the
fingers
of
the
fishermen
we
have
abundance
of
the
saepia
or
of
which
the
people
in
this
country
make
a
delicate
ragout
as
also
of
the
polype
de
mer
which
is
an
ugly
animal
with
long
feelers
like
tails
which
they
often
wind
about
the
legs
of
the
fishermen
they
are
stewed
with
onions
and
eat
something
like
the
market
sometimes
affords
the
ecrivisse
de
mer
which
is
a
lobster
without
claws
of
a
sweetish
taste
and
there
are
a
few
rock
oysters
very
small
and
very
rank
sometimes
the
fishermen
find
under
water
pieces
of
a
very
hard
cement
like
plaister
of
paris
which
contain
a
kind
of
muscle
called
la
datte
from
its
resemblance
to
a
date
these
petrifactions
are
commonly
of
a
triangular
form
and
may
weigh
about
twelve
or
fifteen
pounds
each
and
one
of
them
may
contain
a
dozen
of
these
muscles
which
have
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
taste
or
flavour
though
extremely
curious
as
found
alive
and
juicy
in
the
heart
of
a
rock
almost
as
hard
as
marble
without
any
visible
communication
with
the
air
or
water
i
take
it
for
granted
however
that
the
inclosing
cement
is
porous
and
admits
the
finer
parts
of
the
surrounding
fluid
in
order
to
reach
the
muscles
this
cement
must
be
broke
with
large
hammers
and
it
may
be
truly
said
the
kernal
is
not
worth
the
trouble
of
cracking
the
shell
these
are
found
in
great
plenty
at
ancona
and
other
parts
of
the
adriatic
where
they
go
by
the
name
of
bollani
as
we
are
informed
by
keysler
among
the
fish
of
this
country
there
is
a
very
ugly
animal
of
the
eel
species
which
might
pass
for
a
serpent
it
is
of
a
dusky
black
colour
marked
with
spots
of
yellow
about
eighteen
inches
or
two
feet
long
the
italians
call
it
murena
but
whether
it
is
the
fish
which
had
the
same
name
among
the
antient
romans
i
can
not
pretend
to
determine
the
antient
murena
was
counted
a
great
delicacy
and
was
kept
in
ponds
for
extraordinary
occasions
julius
caesar
borrowed
six
thousand
for
one
entertainment
but
i
imagined
this
was
the
river
lamprey
the
murena
of
this
country
is
in
no
esteem
and
only
eaten
by
the
poor
people
and
trout
are
rarely
found
in
the
rivers
among
the
mountains
the
is
much
esteemed
in
nice
and
called
about
six
or
seven
feet
long
but
i
have
never
seen
it
since
i
wrote
the
above
letter
i
have
eaten
several
times
of
this
fish
which
is
as
white
as
the
finest
veal
and
extremely
delicate
the
emperor
associates
with
the
tunny
fish
and
is
always
taken
in
their
company
they
are
very
scarce
and
when
taken
are
generally
concealed
because
the
head
belongs
to
the
commandant
who
has
likewise
the
privilege
of
buying
the
best
fish
at
a
very
low
price
for
which
reason
the
choice
pieces
are
concealed
by
the
fishermen
and
sent
privately
to
piedmont
or
genoa
but
the
chief
fisheries
on
this
coast
are
of
the
sardines
anchovies
and
tunny
these
are
taken
in
small
quantities
all
the
year
but
spring
and
summer
is
the
season
when
they
mostly
abound
in
june
and
july
a
fleet
of
about
fifty
puts
to
sea
every
evening
about
eight
and
catches
anchovies
in
immense
quantities
one
small
boat
sometimes
takes
in
one
night
rup
amounting
to
six
hundred
weight
but
it
must
be
observed
that
the
pound
here
as
well
as
in
other
parts
of
italy
consists
but
of
twelve
ounces
anchovies
besides
their
making
a
considerable
article
in
the
commerce
of
nice
are
a
great
resource
in
all
families
the
noblesse
and
burgeois
sup
on
sallad
and
anchovies
which
are
eaten
on
all
their
meagre
days
the
fishermen
and
mariners
all
along
this
coast
have
scarce
any
other
food
but
dry
bread
with
a
few
pickled
anchovies
and
when
the
fish
is
eaten
they
rub
their
crusts
with
the
brine
nothing
can
be
more
delicious
than
fresh
anchovies
fried
in
oil
i
prefer
them
to
the
smelts
of
the
thames
i
need
not
mention
that
the
sardines
and
anchovies
are
caught
in
nets
salted
barrelled
and
exported
into
all
the
different
kingdoms
and
states
of
europe
the
sardines
however
are
largest
and
fattest
in
the
month
of
september
a
company
of
adventurers
have
farmed
the
of
the
king
for
six
years
a
monopoly
for
which
they
pay
about
three
thousand
pounds
sterling
they
are
at
a
very
considerable
expence
for
nets
boats
and
attendance
their
nets
are
disposed
in
a
very
curious
manner
across
the
small
bay
of
hospice
in
this
neighbourhood
where
the
fish
chiefly
resort
they
are
never
removed
except
in
the
winter
and
when
they
want
repair
but
there
are
avenues
for
the
fish
to
enter
and
pass
from
one
inclosure
to
another
there
is
a
man
in
a
boat
who
constantly
keeps
watch
when
he
perceives
they
are
fairly
entered
he
has
a
method
for
shutting
all
the
passes
and
confining
the
fish
to
one
apartment
of
the
net
which
is
lifted
up
into
the
boat
until
the
prisoners
are
taken
and
secured
the
generally
runs
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
weight
but
some
of
them
are
much
larger
they
are
immediately
gutted
boiled
and
cut
in
slices
the
guts
and
head
afford
oil
the
slices
are
partly
dried
to
be
eaten
occasionally
with
oil
and
vinegar
or
barrelled
up
in
oil
to
be
exported
it
is
counted
a
delicacy
in
italy
and
piedmont
and
tastes
not
unlike
sturgeon
the
famous
pickle
of
the
ancients
called
garum
was
made
of
the
gills
and
blood
of
the
tunny
or
thynnus
there
is
a
much
more
considerable
fishery
of
it
in
sardinia
where
it
is
said
to
employ
four
hundred
persons
but
this
belongs
to
the
duc
de
pierre
in
the
neighbourhood
of
villa
franca
there
are
people
always
employed
in
fishing
for
coral
and
sponge
which
grow
adhering
to
the
rocks
under
water
their
methods
do
not
favour
much
of
ingenuity
for
the
coral
they
lower
down
a
swab
composed
of
what
is
called
spunyarn
on
board
our
ships
of
war
hanging
in
distinct
threads
and
sunk
by
means
of
a
great
weight
which
striking
against
the
coral
in
its
descent
disengages
it
from
the
rocks
and
some
of
the
pieces
being
intangled
among
the
threads
of
the
swab
are
brought
up
with
it
above
water
the
sponge
is
got
by
means
of
a
fitted
with
hooks
which
being
lowered
down
fastens
upon
it
and
tears
it
from
the
rocks
in
some
parts
of
the
adriatic
and
archipelago
these
substances
are
gathered
by
divers
who
can
remain
five
minutes
below
water
but
i
will
not
detain
you
one
minute
longer
though
i
must
observe
that
there
is
plenty
of
fine
samphire
growing
along
all
these
rocks
neglected
and
adieu
letter
xix
nice
october
dear
sir
before
i
tell
you
the
price
of
provisions
at
nice
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
something
of
the
money
the
gold
coin
of
sardinia
consists
of
the
doppia
di
savoia
value
livres
piedmontese
about
the
size
of
a
and
the
mezzo
doppia
or
piece
of
twelve
livres
in
silver
there
is
the
scudo
of
six
livres
the
mezzo
scudo
of
three
and
the
quarto
or
pezza
di
trenta
soldi
but
all
these
are
very
scarce
we
seldom
see
any
gold
and
silver
coin
but
the
and
the
six
and
pieces
of
france
a
sure
sign
that
the
french
suffer
by
their
contraband
commerce
with
the
nissards
the
coin
chiefly
used
at
market
is
a
piece
of
copper
silvered
that
passes
for
seven
sols
and
a
half
another
of
the
same
sort
valued
two
sols
and
a
half
they
have
on
one
side
the
impression
of
the
king
head
and
on
the
other
the
arms
of
savoy
with
a
ducal
crown
inscribed
with
his
name
and
titles
there
are
of
genuine
copper
pieces
of
one
sol
stamped
on
one
side
with
a
cross
fleuree
and
on
the
reverse
with
the
cypher
and
crown
inscribed
as
the
others
finally
there
is
another
small
copper
piece
called
piccalon
the
sixth
part
of
a
sol
with
a
plain
cross
and
on
the
reverse
a
surmounted
with
a
crown
the
legend
as
above
the
impression
and
legend
on
the
gold
and
silver
coins
are
the
same
as
those
on
the
pieces
of
seven
sols
and
a
half
the
livre
of
piedmont
consists
of
twenty
sols
and
is
very
near
of
the
same
value
as
an
english
shilling
ten
sols
therefore
are
equal
to
sterling
butcher
meat
in
general
sells
at
nice
for
three
sols
a
pound
and
veal
is
something
dearer
but
then
there
are
but
twelve
ounces
in
the
pound
which
being
allowed
for
sixteen
ounces
come
for
something
less
than
twopence
halfpenny
english
fish
commonly
sells
for
four
sols
the
twelve
ounces
or
five
for
the
english
pound
and
these
five
are
equivalent
to
of
our
money
but
sometimes
we
are
obliged
to
pay
five
and
even
six
sols
for
the
piedmontese
pound
of
fish
a
turkey
that
would
sell
for
five
or
six
shillings
at
the
london
market
costs
me
but
three
at
nice
i
can
buy
a
good
capon
for
thirty
sols
or
and
the
same
price
i
pay
for
a
brace
of
partridges
or
a
good
hare
i
can
have
a
woodcock
for
sols
but
the
pigeons
are
dearer
than
in
london
rabbits
are
very
rare
and
there
is
scarce
a
goose
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
county
of
nice
and
teal
are
sometimes
to
be
had
in
the
winter
and
now
i
am
speaking
of
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
tell
you
what
i
know
of
the
halcyon
or
it
is
a
bird
though
very
rare
in
this
country
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
the
body
brown
and
the
belly
white
by
a
wonderful
instinct
it
makes
its
nest
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
lays
its
eggs
in
the
month
of
november
when
the
mediterranean
is
always
calm
and
smooth
as
a
the
people
about
here
call
them
martinets
because
they
begin
to
hatch
about
martinmass
their
nests
are
sometimes
seen
floating
near
the
shore
and
generally
become
the
prize
of
the
boys
who
are
very
alert
in
catching
them
you
know
all
are
allowed
by
the
church
of
rome
to
be
eaten
on
meagre
days
as
a
kind
of
fish
and
the
monks
especially
do
not
fail
to
make
use
of
this
permission
sea
turtle
or
tortoises
are
often
found
at
sea
by
the
mariners
in
these
latitudes
but
they
are
not
the
green
sort
so
much
in
request
among
the
aldermen
of
london
all
the
mediterranean
turtle
are
of
the
kind
called
loggerhead
which
in
the
are
eaten
by
none
but
hungry
seamen
negroes
and
the
lowest
class
of
people
one
of
these
weighing
about
two
hundred
pounds
was
lately
brought
on
shore
by
the
fishermen
of
nice
who
found
it
floating
asleep
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
whole
town
was
alarmed
at
sight
of
such
a
monster
the
nature
of
which
they
could
not
comprehend
however
the
monks
called
minims
of
francesco
di
paolo
guided
by
a
sure
instinct
marked
it
as
their
prey
and
surrounded
it
accordingly
the
friars
of
other
convents
not
quite
so
hungry
crowding
down
to
the
beach
declared
it
should
not
be
eaten
dropped
some
hints
about
the
possibility
of
its
being
something
praeternatural
and
diabolical
and
even
proposed
exorcisms
and
aspersions
with
holy
water
the
populace
were
divided
according
to
their
attachment
to
this
or
that
convent
a
mighty
clamour
arose
and
the
police
in
order
to
remove
the
cause
of
their
contention
ordered
the
tortoise
to
be
recommitted
to
the
waves
a
sentence
which
the
franciscans
saw
executed
not
without
sighs
and
lamentation
the
or
terrapin
is
much
better
known
at
nice
as
being
a
native
of
this
country
yet
the
best
are
brought
from
the
island
of
sardinia
the
soup
or
bouillon
of
this
animal
is
always
prescribed
here
as
a
great
restorative
to
consumptive
patients
the
bread
of
nice
is
very
indifferent
and
i
am
persuaded
very
unwholesome
the
flour
is
generally
musty
and
not
quite
free
of
sand
this
is
either
owing
to
the
particles
of
the
rubbed
off
in
grinding
or
to
what
adheres
to
the
corn
itself
in
being
threshed
upon
the
common
ground
for
there
are
no
in
this
country
i
shall
now
take
notice
of
the
vegetables
of
nice
in
the
winter
we
have
green
pease
asparagus
artichoaks
cauliflower
beans
french
beans
celery
and
endive
cabbage
coleworts
radishes
turnips
carrots
betteraves
sorrel
lettuce
onions
garlic
and
chalot
we
have
potatoes
from
the
mountains
mushrooms
champignons
and
truffles
piedmont
affords
white
truffles
counted
the
most
delicious
in
the
world
they
sell
for
about
three
livres
the
pound
the
fruits
of
this
season
are
pickled
olives
oranges
lemons
citrons
citronelles
dried
figs
grapes
apples
pears
almonds
chestnuts
walnuts
filberts
medlars
pomegranates
and
a
fruit
called
azerolles
the
italians
call
them
lazerruoli
about
the
size
of
a
nutmeg
of
an
oblong
shape
red
colour
and
agreeable
acid
taste
i
might
likewise
add
the
cherry
of
the
laurus
cerasus
which
is
sold
in
the
market
very
beautiful
to
the
eye
but
insipid
to
the
palate
in
summer
we
have
all
those
vegetables
in
perfection
there
is
also
a
kind
of
small
courge
or
gourd
of
which
the
people
of
the
country
make
a
very
savoury
ragout
with
the
help
of
eggs
cheese
and
fresh
anchovies
another
is
made
of
the
badenjean
which
the
spaniards
call
berengena
this
fruit
is
called
melanzana
in
italy
and
is
much
esteemed
by
the
jews
in
leghorn
perhaps
melanzana
is
a
corruption
of
malamsana
it
is
much
eaten
in
spain
and
the
levant
as
well
as
by
the
moors
in
barbary
it
is
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
hen
egg
inclosed
in
a
cup
like
an
acorn
when
ripe
of
a
faint
purple
colour
it
grows
on
a
stalk
about
a
foot
high
with
long
spines
or
prickles
the
people
here
have
different
ways
of
slicing
and
dressing
it
by
broiling
boiling
and
stewing
with
other
ingredients
but
it
is
at
best
an
insipid
dish
there
are
some
caperbushes
in
this
neighbourhood
which
grow
wild
in
holes
of
garden
walls
and
require
no
sort
of
cultivation
in
one
or
two
gardens
there
are
but
the
dates
never
ripen
in
my
register
of
the
weather
i
have
marked
the
seasons
of
the
principal
fruits
in
this
country
in
may
we
have
strawberries
which
continue
in
season
two
or
three
months
these
are
of
the
wood
kind
very
grateful
and
of
a
good
flavour
but
the
scarlets
and
hautboys
are
not
known
at
nice
in
the
beginning
of
june
and
even
sooner
the
cherries
begin
to
be
ripe
they
are
a
kind
of
bleeding
hearts
large
fleshy
and
high
flavoured
though
rather
too
luscious
i
have
likewise
seen
a
few
of
those
we
call
kentish
cherries
which
are
much
more
cool
acid
and
agreeable
especially
in
this
hot
climate
the
cherries
are
succeeded
by
the
apricots
and
peaches
which
are
all
standards
and
of
consequence
better
flavoured
than
what
we
call
the
trees
as
well
as
almonds
grow
and
bear
without
care
and
cultivation
and
may
be
seen
in
the
open
fields
about
nice
but
without
proper
culture
the
fruit
degenerates
the
best
peaches
i
have
seen
at
nice
are
the
amberges
of
a
yellow
hue
and
oblong
shape
about
the
size
of
a
small
lemon
their
consistence
is
much
more
solid
than
that
of
our
english
peaches
and
their
taste
more
delicious
several
trees
of
this
kind
i
have
in
my
own
garden
here
is
likewise
plenty
of
other
sorts
but
no
nectarines
we
have
little
choice
of
plumbs
neither
do
i
admire
the
pears
or
apples
of
this
country
but
the
most
agreeable
apples
i
ever
tasted
come
from
final
and
are
called
pomi
carli
the
greatest
fault
i
find
with
most
fruits
in
this
climate
is
that
they
are
too
sweet
and
luscious
and
want
that
agreeable
acid
which
is
so
cooling
and
so
grateful
in
a
hot
country
this
too
is
the
case
with
our
grapes
of
which
there
is
great
plenty
and
variety
plump
and
juicy
and
large
as
plumbs
nature
however
has
not
neglected
to
provide
other
agreeable
vegetable
juices
to
cool
the
human
body
during
the
whole
summer
we
have
plenty
of
musk
melons
i
can
buy
one
as
large
as
my
head
for
the
value
of
an
english
penny
but
one
of
the
best
and
largest
weighing
ten
or
twelve
pounds
i
can
have
for
twelve
sols
or
about
sterling
from
antibes
and
sardinia
we
have
another
fruit
called
a
watermelon
which
is
well
known
in
jamaica
and
some
of
our
other
colonies
those
from
antibes
are
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
but
the
sardinian
and
jamaica
watermelons
are
four
times
as
large
the
skin
is
green
smooth
and
thin
the
inside
is
a
purple
pulp
studded
with
broad
flat
black
seeds
and
impregnated
with
a
juice
the
most
cool
delicate
and
refreshing
that
can
well
be
conceived
one
would
imagine
the
pulp
itself
dissolved
in
the
stomach
for
you
may
eat
of
it
until
you
are
filled
up
to
the
tongue
without
feeling
the
least
inconvenience
it
is
so
friendly
to
the
constitution
that
in
ardent
inflammatory
fevers
it
is
drank
as
the
best
emulsion
at
genoa
florence
and
rome
it
is
sold
in
the
streets
ready
cut
in
slices
and
the
porters
sweating
under
their
burthens
buy
and
eat
them
as
they
pass
a
porter
of
london
quenches
his
thirst
with
a
draught
of
strong
beer
a
porter
of
rome
or
naples
refreshes
himself
with
a
slice
of
or
a
glass
of
the
one
costs
three
the
last
half
a
farthing
which
of
them
is
most
effectual
i
am
sure
the
men
are
equally
pleased
it
is
commonly
remarked
that
beer
strengthens
as
well
as
refreshes
but
the
porters
of
constantinople
who
never
drink
any
thing
stronger
than
water
and
eat
very
little
animal
food
will
lift
and
carry
heavier
burthens
than
any
other
porters
in
the
known
world
if
we
may
believe
the
most
respectable
travellers
a
turk
will
carry
a
load
of
seven
hundred
weight
which
is
more
i
believe
than
any
english
porter
ever
attempted
to
carry
any
length
of
way
among
the
refreshments
of
these
warm
countries
i
ought
not
to
forget
mentioning
the
sorbettes
which
are
sold
in
and
places
of
public
resort
they
are
iced
froth
made
with
juice
of
oranges
apricots
or
peaches
very
agreeable
to
the
palate
and
so
extremely
cold
that
i
was
afraid
to
swallow
them
in
this
hot
country
until
i
found
from
information
and
experience
that
they
may
be
taken
in
moderation
without
any
bad
consequence
another
considerable
article
in
is
wine
which
we
have
here
good
and
reasonable
the
wine
of
tavelle
in
languedoc
is
very
near
as
good
as
burgundy
and
may
be
had
at
nice
at
the
rate
of
a
bottle
the
sweet
wine
of
laurent
counted
equal
to
that
of
frontignan
costs
about
eight
or
a
quart
pretty
good
malaga
may
be
had
for
half
the
money
those
who
make
their
own
wine
choose
the
grapes
from
different
vineyards
and
have
them
picked
pressed
and
fermented
at
home
that
which
is
made
by
the
peasants
both
red
and
white
is
generally
genuine
but
the
of
nice
brew
and
balderdash
and
even
mix
it
with
pigeons
dung
and
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
a
stranger
and
sojourner
should
buy
his
own
grapes
and
make
his
own
provision
of
wine
but
he
may
buy
it
by
recommendation
from
the
peasants
for
about
eighteen
or
twenty
livres
the
charge
consisting
of
eleven
rup
five
pounds
in
other
words
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
this
country
so
as
to
bring
it
for
something
less
than
a
quart
the
nice
wine
when
mixed
with
water
makes
an
agreeable
beverage
there
is
an
inferior
sort
for
servants
drank
by
the
common
people
which
in
the
cabaret
does
not
cost
above
a
penny
a
bottle
the
people
here
are
not
so
nice
as
the
english
in
the
management
of
their
wine
it
is
kept
in
flacons
or
large
flasks
without
corks
having
a
little
oil
at
top
it
is
not
deemed
the
worse
for
having
been
opened
a
day
or
two
before
and
they
expose
it
to
the
hot
sun
and
all
kinds
of
weather
without
hesitation
certain
it
is
this
treatment
has
little
or
no
effect
upon
its
taste
flavour
and
transparency
the
brandy
of
nice
is
very
indifferent
and
the
liqueurs
are
so
sweetened
with
coarse
sugar
that
they
scarce
retain
the
taste
or
flavour
of
any
other
ingredient
the
last
article
of
domestic
oeconomy
which
i
shall
mention
is
fuel
or
wood
for
firing
which
i
buy
for
eleven
sols
a
little
more
than
halfpenny
a
quintal
consisting
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
nice
weight
the
best
which
is
of
oak
comes
from
sardinia
the
common
sort
is
olive
which
being
cut
with
the
sap
in
it
ought
to
be
laid
in
during
the
summer
otherwise
it
will
make
a
very
uncomfortable
fire
in
my
kitchen
and
two
chambers
i
burned
fifteen
thousand
weight
of
wood
in
four
weeks
exclusive
of
charcoal
for
the
kitchen
stoves
and
of
for
lighting
the
fires
these
last
are
as
large
as
pineapples
which
they
greatly
resemble
in
shape
and
to
which
indeed
they
give
their
name
and
being
full
of
turpentine
make
a
wonderful
blaze
for
the
same
purpose
the
people
of
these
countries
use
the
sarments
or
cuttings
of
the
vines
which
they
sell
made
up
in
small
fascines
this
great
consumption
of
wood
is
owing
to
the
large
fires
used
in
roasting
pieces
of
beef
and
joints
in
the
english
manner
the
roasts
of
this
country
seldom
exceed
two
or
three
pounds
of
meat
and
their
other
plats
are
made
over
stove
holes
but
it
is
now
high
time
to
conduct
you
from
the
kitchen
where
you
have
been
too
long
detained
by
your
humble
servant
i
have
mentioned
the
prices
of
almost
all
the
articles
in
as
they
are
paid
by
the
english
but
exclusive
of
butcher
meat
i
am
certain
the
natives
do
not
pay
so
much
by
thirty
per
cent
their
imposition
on
us
is
not
only
a
proof
of
their
own
villany
and
hatred
but
a
scandal
on
their
government
which
ought
to
interfere
in
favour
of
the
subjects
of
a
nation
to
which
they
are
so
much
bound
in
point
of
policy
as
well
as
gratitude
letter
xx
nice
october
sir
as
i
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity
and
that
of
my
friends
i
obey
your
injunctions
with
pleasure
though
not
without
some
apprehension
that
my
inquiries
will
afford
you
very
little
entertainment
the
place
where
i
am
is
of
very
little
importance
or
consequence
as
a
state
or
community
neither
is
there
any
thing
curious
or
interesting
in
the
character
or
oeconomy
of
its
inhabitants
there
are
some
few
merchants
in
nice
said
to
be
in
good
circumstances
i
know
one
of
them
who
deals
to
a
considerable
extent
and
goes
twice
a
year
to
london
to
attend
the
sales
of
the
company
he
buys
up
a
very
large
quantity
of
muslins
and
other
indian
goods
and
freights
a
ship
in
the
river
to
transport
them
to
villa
franca
some
of
these
are
sent
to
swisserland
but
i
believe
the
greater
part
is
smuggled
into
france
by
virtue
of
counterfeit
stamps
which
are
here
used
without
any
ceremony
indeed
the
chief
commerce
of
this
place
is
a
contraband
traffick
carried
on
to
the
disadvantage
of
france
and
i
am
told
that
the
farmers
of
the
levant
company
in
that
kingdom
find
their
account
in
conniving
at
it
certain
it
is
a
great
quantity
of
merchandize
is
brought
hither
every
week
by
mules
from
turin
and
other
parts
in
piedmont
and
afterwards
conveyed
to
the
other
side
of
the
var
either
by
land
or
water
the
mules
of
piedmont
are
exceeding
strong
and
hardy
one
of
them
will
carry
a
burthen
of
near
six
hundred
weight
they
are
easily
nourished
and
require
no
other
respite
from
their
labour
but
the
night
repose
they
are
the
only
carriage
that
can
be
used
in
crossing
the
mountains
being
very
and
it
is
observed
that
in
choosing
their
steps
they
always
march
upon
the
brink
of
the
precipice
you
must
let
them
take
their
own
way
otherwise
you
will
be
in
danger
of
losing
your
life
for
they
are
obstinate
even
to
desperation
it
is
very
dangerous
for
a
person
on
horseback
to
meet
those
animals
they
have
such
an
aversion
to
horses
that
they
will
attack
them
with
incredible
fury
so
as
even
to
tear
them
and
their
riders
in
pieces
and
the
best
method
for
avoiding
this
fate
is
to
clap
spurs
to
your
beast
and
seek
your
safety
in
flight
i
have
been
more
than
once
obliged
to
fly
before
them
they
always
give
you
warning
by
raising
a
hideous
braying
as
soon
as
they
perceive
the
horse
at
a
distance
the
mules
of
provence
are
not
so
mischievous
because
they
are
more
used
to
the
sight
and
society
of
horses
but
those
of
piedmont
are
by
far
the
largest
and
the
strongest
i
have
seen
some
very
feasible
schemes
for
improving
the
commerce
of
nice
have
been
presented
to
the
ministry
of
turin
but
hitherto
without
success
the
english
import
annually
between
two
and
three
thousand
bales
of
raw
silk
the
growth
of
piedmont
and
this
declaration
would
be
held
legal
evidence
in
some
parts
of
france
the
cure
of
the
parish
on
all
souls
day
which
is
called
le
jour
des
morts
says
a
libera
domine
for
two
sols
at
every
grave
in
the
for
the
release
of
the
soul
whose
body
is
there
interred
the
artisans
of
nice
are
very
lazy
very
needy
very
aukward
and
void
of
all
ingenuity
the
price
of
their
labour
is
very
near
as
high
as
at
london
or
paris
rather
than
work
for
moderate
profit
arising
from
constant
employment
which
would
comfortably
maintain
them
and
their
families
they
choose
to
starve
at
home
to
lounge
about
the
ramparts
bask
themselves
in
the
sun
or
play
at
bowls
in
the
streets
from
morning
night
the
lowest
class
of
people
consists
of
fishermen
day
labourers
porters
and
peasants
these
last
are
distributed
chiefly
in
the
small
cassines
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
and
are
said
to
amount
to
twelve
thousand
they
are
employed
in
labouring
the
ground
and
have
all
the
outward
signs
of
extreme
misery
they
are
all
diminutive
meagre
withered
dirty
and
half
naked
in
their
complexions
not
barely
swarthy
but
as
black
as
moors
and
i
believe
many
of
them
are
descendants
of
that
people
they
are
very
hard
favoured
and
their
women
in
general
have
the
coarsest
features
i
have
ever
seen
it
must
be
owned
however
they
have
the
finest
teeth
in
the
world
the
nourishment
of
those
poor
creatures
consists
of
the
refuse
of
the
garden
very
coarse
bread
a
kind
of
meal
called
polenta
made
of
indian
corn
which
is
very
nourishing
and
agreeable
and
a
little
oil
but
even
in
these
particulars
they
seem
to
be
stinted
to
very
scanty
meals
i
have
known
a
peasant
feed
his
family
with
the
skins
of
boiled
beans
their
hogs
are
much
better
fed
than
their
children
is
pity
they
have
no
cows
which
would
yield
milk
butter
and
cheese
for
the
sustenance
of
their
families
with
all
this
wretchedness
one
of
these
peasants
will
not
work
in
your
garden
for
less
than
eighteen
sols
about
eleven
pence
sterling
per
diem
and
then
he
does
not
half
the
work
of
an
english
labourer
if
there
is
fruit
in
it
or
any
thing
he
can
convey
he
will
infallibly
steal
it
if
you
do
not
keep
a
very
watchful
eye
over
him
all
the
common
people
are
thieves
and
beggars
and
i
believe
this
is
always
the
case
with
people
who
are
extremely
indigent
and
miserable
in
other
respects
they
are
seldom
guilty
of
excesses
they
are
remarkably
respectful
and
submissive
to
their
superiors
the
populace
of
nice
are
very
quiet
and
orderly
they
are
little
addicted
to
drunkenness
i
have
never
heard
of
one
riot
since
i
lived
among
them
and
murder
and
robbery
are
altogether
unknown
a
man
may
walk
alone
over
the
county
of
nice
at
midnight
without
danger
of
insult
the
police
is
very
well
regulated
no
man
is
permitted
to
wear
a
pistol
or
dagger
on
pain
of
being
sent
to
the
gallies
i
am
informed
that
both
murder
and
robbery
are
very
frequent
in
some
parts
of
piedmont
even
here
when
the
peasants
quarrel
in
their
cups
which
very
seldom
happens
they
draw
their
knives
and
the
one
infallibly
stabs
the
other
to
such
extremities
however
they
never
proceed
except
when
there
is
a
woman
in
the
case
and
mutual
jealousy
with
the
liquor
they
have
drank
to
inflame
their
passions
in
nice
the
common
people
retire
to
their
lodgings
at
eight
in
winter
and
nine
in
summer
every
person
found
in
the
streets
after
these
hours
is
apprehended
by
the
patrole
and
if
he
can
not
give
a
good
account
of
himself
sent
to
prison
at
nine
in
winter
and
ten
in
summer
there
is
a
rung
warning
the
people
to
put
out
their
lights
and
go
to
bed
this
is
a
very
necessary
precaution
in
towns
subject
to
conflagrations
but
of
small
use
in
nice
where
there
is
very
little
combustible
in
the
houses
the
punishments
inflicted
upon
malefactors
and
delinquents
at
nice
are
hanging
for
capital
crimes
slavery
on
board
the
gallies
for
a
limited
term
or
for
life
according
to
the
nature
of
the
transgression
flagellation
and
the
strappado
this
last
is
performed
by
hoisting
up
the
criminal
by
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
on
a
pulley
about
two
stories
high
from
whence
the
rope
being
suddenly
slackened
he
falls
to
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
ground
where
he
is
stopped
with
a
violent
shock
arising
from
the
weight
of
his
body
and
the
velocity
of
his
descent
which
generally
dislocates
his
shoulders
with
incredible
pain
this
dreadful
execution
is
sometimes
repeated
in
a
few
minutes
on
the
same
delinquent
so
that
the
very
ligaments
are
tore
from
his
joints
and
his
arms
are
rendered
useless
for
life
the
poverty
of
the
people
in
this
country
as
well
as
in
the
south
of
france
may
be
conjectured
from
the
appearance
of
their
domestic
animals
the
draughthorses
mules
and
asses
of
the
peasants
are
so
meagre
as
to
excite
compassion
there
is
not
a
dog
to
be
seen
in
tolerable
case
and
the
cats
are
so
many
emblems
of
famine
frightfully
thin
and
dangerously
rapacious
i
wonder
the
dogs
and
they
do
not
devour
young
children
another
proof
of
that
indigence
which
reigns
among
the
common
people
is
this
you
may
pass
through
the
whole
south
of
france
as
well
as
the
county
of
nice
where
there
is
no
want
of
groves
woods
and
plantations
without
hearing
the
song
of
blackbird
thrush
linnet
or
any
other
bird
whatsoever
all
is
silent
and
solitary
the
poor
birds
are
destroyed
or
driven
for
refuge
into
other
countries
by
the
savage
persecution
of
the
people
who
spare
no
pains
to
kill
and
catch
them
for
their
own
subsistence
scarce
a
sparrow
tomtit
or
wren
can
the
guns
and
snares
of
those
indefatigable
fowlers
even
the
noblesse
make
parties
to
go
a
la
chasse
that
is
to
kill
those
little
birds
which
they
eat
as
gibier
or
game
the
great
poverty
of
the
people
here
is
owing
to
their
religion
half
of
their
time
is
lost
in
observing
the
great
number
of
festivals
and
half
of
their
substance
is
given
to
mendicant
friars
and
parish
priests
but
if
the
church
occasions
their
indigence
it
likewise
in
some
measure
alleviates
the
horrors
of
it
by
amusing
them
with
shows
processions
and
even
those
very
feasts
which
afford
a
recess
from
labour
in
a
country
where
the
climate
disposes
them
to
idleness
if
the
peasants
in
the
neighbourhood
of
any
chapel
dedicated
to
a
saint
whose
day
is
to
be
celebrated
have
a
mind
to
make
a
festin
in
other
words
a
fair
they
apply
to
the
commandant
of
nice
for
a
license
which
costs
them
about
a
french
crown
this
being
obtained
they
assemble
after
service
men
and
women
in
their
best
apparel
and
dance
to
the
musick
of
fiddles
and
pipe
and
tabor
or
rather
pipe
and
drum
there
are
hucksters
stands
with
pedlary
ware
and
for
presents
cakes
and
bread
liqueurs
and
wine
and
thither
generally
resort
all
the
company
of
nice
i
have
seen
our
whole
noblesse
at
one
of
these
festins
kept
on
the
highway
in
summer
mingled
with
an
immense
crowd
of
peasants
mules
and
asses
covered
with
dust
and
sweating
at
every
pore
with
the
excessive
heat
of
the
weather
i
should
be
much
puzzled
to
tell
whence
their
enjoyment
arises
on
such
occasions
or
to
explain
their
motives
for
going
thither
unless
they
are
prescribed
it
for
pennance
as
a
of
purgatory
now
i
am
speaking
of
religious
institutions
i
can
not
help
observing
that
the
antient
romans
were
still
more
superstitious
than
the
modern
italians
and
that
the
number
of
their
religious
feasts
sacrifices
fasts
and
holidays
was
even
greater
than
those
of
the
christian
church
of
rome
they
had
their
festi
and
profesti
their
feriae
stativae
and
conceptivae
their
fixed
and
moveable
feasts
their
esuriales
or
fasting
days
and
their
precidaneae
or
vigils
the
agonales
were
celebrated
in
january
the
carmentales
in
january
and
february
the
lupercales
and
matronales
in
march
the
megalesia
in
april
the
floralia
in
may
and
the
matralia
in
june
they
had
their
saturnalia
robigalia
venalia
vertumnalia
fornacalia
palilia
and
laralia
their
latinae
their
paganales
their
sementinae
their
compitales
and
their
imperativae
such
as
the
novemdalia
instituted
by
the
senate
on
account
of
a
supposed
shower
of
stones
besides
every
private
family
had
a
number
of
feriae
kept
either
by
way
of
rejoicing
for
some
benefit
or
mourning
for
some
calamity
every
time
it
thundered
the
day
was
kept
holy
every
ninth
day
was
a
holiday
thence
called
nundinae
quasi
novendinae
there
was
the
dies
denominalis
which
was
the
fourth
of
the
kalends
nones
and
ides
of
every
month
over
and
above
the
anniversary
of
every
great
defeat
which
the
republic
had
sustained
particularly
the
dies
alliensis
or
fifteenth
of
the
kalends
of
december
on
which
the
romans
were
totally
defeated
by
the
gauls
and
veientes
as
lucan
says
et
damnata
diu
romanis
allia
fastis
and

calendar
condemn
the
vast
variety
of
their
deities
said
to
amount
to
thirty
thousand
with
their
respective
rites
of
adoration
could
not
fail
to
introduce
such
a
number
of
ceremonies
shews
sacrifices
lustrations
and
public
processions
as
must
have
employed
the
people
almost
constantly
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
this
continual
dissipation
must
have
been
a
great
enemy
to
industry
and
the
people
must
have
been
idle
and
effeminate
i
think
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
prove
that
there
is
very
little
difference
in
point
of
character
between
the
antient
and
modern
inhabitants
of
rome
and
that
the
great
figure
which
this
empire
made
of
old
was
not
so
much
owing
to
the
intrinsic
virtue
of
its
citizens
as
to
the
barbarism
ignorance
and
imbecility
of
the
nations
they
subdued
instances
of
public
and
private
virtue
i
find
as
frequent
and
as
striking
in
the
history
of
other
nations
as
in
the
annals
of
antient
rome
and
now
that
the
kingdoms
and
states
of
europe
are
pretty
equally
enlightened
and
ballanced
in
the
scale
of
political
power
i
am
of
opinion
that
if
the
most
fortunate
generals
of
the
roman
commonwealth
were
again
placed
at
the
head
of
the
very
armies
they
once
commanded
instead
of
extending
their
conquests
over
all
europe
and
asia
they
would
hardly
be
able
to
subdue
and
retain
under
their
dominion
all
the
petty
republics
that
subsist
in
italy
but
i
am
tired
with
writing
and
i
believe
you
will
be
tired
with
reading
this
long
letter
notwithstanding
all
your
prepossession
in
favour
of
your
very
humble
servant
letter
xxi
nice
november
dear
doctor
in
my
enquiries
about
the
revenues
of
nice
i
am
obliged
to
trust
to
the
information
of
the
inhabitants
who
are
much
given
to
exaggerate
they
tell
me
the
revenues
of
this
town
amount
to
one
hundred
thousand
livres
or
five
thousand
pounds
sterling
of
which
i
would
strike
off
at
least
one
fourth
as
an
addition
of
their
own
vanity
perhaps
if
we
deduct
a
third
it
will
be
nearer
the
truth
for
i
can
not
find
out
any
other
funds
they
have
but
the
butchery
and
the
bakery
which
they
farm
at
so
much
a
year
to
the
best
bidder
and
the
droits
or
duties
upon
provision
brought
into
the
city
but
these
are
very
small
the
king
is
said
to
draw
from
nice
one
hundred
thousand
livres
annually
arising
from
a
amounting
to
seven
hundred
pounds
sterling
in
lieu
of
the
taille
from
which
this
town
and
county
are
exempted
an
inconsiderable
duty
upon
wine
sold
in
and
the
droits
du
port
these
last
consist
of
anchorage
paid
by
all
vessels
in
proportion
to
their
tonnage
when
they
enter
the
harbours
of
nice
and
villa
franca
besides
all
foreign
vessels
under
a
certain
stipulated
burthen
that
pass
between
the
island
of
sardinia
and
this
coast
are
obliged
in
going
to
the
eastward
to
enter
and
pay
a
certain
regulated
imposition
on
pain
of
being
taken
and
made
prize
the
prince
of
monaco
exacts
a
talliage
of
the
same
kind
and
both
he
and
the
king
of
sardinia
maintain
armed
cruisers
to
assert
this
prerogative
from
which
however
the
english
and
french
are
exempted
by
treaty
in
consequence
of
having
paid
a
sum
of
money
at
once
in
all
probability
it
was
originally
given
as
a
consideration
for
maintaining
lights
on
the
shore
for
the
benefit
of
navigators
like
the
toll
paid
for
passing
the
sound
in
the
baltic
upon
further
inquiry
i
find
it
was
given
in
consideration
of
being
protected
from
the
corsairs
by
the
naval
force
of
the
duke
of
savoy
and
prince
of
monaco
the
fanal
or
lanthorn
to
the
eastward
of
villa
franca
is
kept
in
good
repair
and
still
lighted
in
the
winter
the
toll
however
is
a
very
troublesome
tax
upon
feluccas
and
other
small
craft
which
are
greatly
retarded
in
their
voyages
and
often
lose
the
benefit
of
a
fair
wind
by
being
obliged
to
run
inshore
and
enter
those
harbours
the
tobacco
the
king
manufactures
at
his
own
expence
and
sells
for
his
own
profit
at
a
very
high
price
and
every
person
convicted
of
selling
this
commodity
in
secret
is
sent
to
the
gallies
for
life
the
salt
comes
chiefly
from
sardinia
and
is
stored
up
in
the
king
magazine
from
whence
it
is
exported
to
piedmont
and
other
parts
of
his
inland
dominions
and
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
that
sardinia
produces
very
good
horses
though
small
strong
hardy
full
of
mettle
and
easily
fed
the
whole
county
of
nice
is
said
to
yield
the
king
half
a
million
of
livres
about
thousand
pounds
sterling
arising
from
a
small
donative
made
by
every
town
and
village
for
the
lands
pay
no
tax
or
imposition
but
the
tithes
to
the
church
his
revenue
then
flows
from
the
gabelle
on
salt
and
wine
and
these
so
that
we
may
strike
off
one
fifth
of
the
sum
at
which
the
whole
is
estimated
and
conclude
that
the
king
draws
from
the
county
at
nice
about
four
hundred
thousand
livres
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
sterling
that
his
revenues
from
nice
are
not
great
appears
from
the
smallness
of
the
appointments
allowed
to
his
officers
the
president
has
about
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
and
the
intendant
about
two
the
pay
of
the
commandant
does
not
exceed
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
but
he
has
certain
privileges
called
the
tour
du
baton
some
of
which
a
man
of
spirit
would
not
insist
upon
he
who
commands
at
present
having
no
estate
of
his
own
enjoys
a
small
commandery
which
being
added
to
his
appointments
at
nice
make
the
whole
amount
to
about
five
hundred
pounds
sterling
if
we
may
believe
the
politicians
of
nice
the
king
of
sardinia
whole
revenue
does
not
fall
short
of
twenty
millions
of
piedmontese
livres
being
above
one
million
of
our
money
it
must
be
owned
that
there
is
no
country
in
christendom
less
taxed
than
that
of
nice
and
as
the
soil
produces
the
necessaries
of
life
the
inhabitants
with
a
little
industry
might
renew
the
golden
age
in
this
happy
climate
among
their
groves
woods
and
mountains
beautified
with
fountains
brooks
rivers
torrents
and
cascades
in
the
midst
of
these
pastoral
advantages
the
peasants
are
poor
and
miserable
they
have
no
stock
to
begin
the
world
with
they
have
no
leases
of
the
lands
they
cultivate
but
entirely
depend
from
year
to
year
on
the
pleasure
of
the
arbitrary
landholder
who
may
turn
them
out
at
a
minute
warning
and
they
are
oppressed
by
the
mendicant
friars
and
parish
priests
who
rob
them
of
the
best
fruits
of
their
labour
after
all
the
ground
is
too
scanty
for
the
number
of
families
which
are
crouded
on
it
you
desire
to
know
the
state
of
the
arts
and
sciences
at
nice
which
indeed
is
almost
a
total
blank
i
know
not
what
men
of
talents
this
place
may
have
formerly
produced
but
at
present
it
seems
to
be
consecrated
to
the
reign
of
dulness
and
superstition
it
is
very
surprising
to
see
a
people
established
between
two
enlightened
nations
so
devoid
of
taste
and
literature
here
are
no
tolerable
pictures
busts
statues
nor
edifices
the
very
ornaments
of
the
churches
are
wretchedly
conceived
and
worse
executed
they
have
no
public
nor
private
libraries
that
afford
any
thing
worth
perusing
there
is
not
even
a
bookseller
in
nice
though
they
value
themselves
upon
their
being
natives
of
italy
they
are
unacquainted
with
music
the
few
that
play
upon
instruments
attend
only
to
the
execution
they
have
no
genius
nor
taste
nor
any
knowledge
of
harmony
and
composition
among
the
french
a
nissard
piques
himself
on
being
provencal
but
in
florence
milan
or
rome
he
claims
the
honour
of
being
born
a
native
of
italy
the
people
of
condition
here
speak
both
languages
equally
well
or
rather
equally
ill
for
they
use
a
low
uncouth
phraseology
and
their
pronunciation
is
extremely
vitious
their
vernacular
tongue
is
what
they
call
patois
though
in
so
calling
it
they
do
it
patois
from
the
latin
word
patavinitas
means
no
more
than
a
provincial
accent
or
dialect
it
takes
its
name
from
patavium
or
padua
which
was
the
birthplace
of
livy
who
with
all
his
merit
as
a
writer
has
admitted
into
his
history
some
provincial
expressions
of
his
own
country
the
patois
or
native
tongue
of
nice
is
no
other
than
the
ancient
provencal
from
which
the
italian
spanish
and
french
languages
have
been
formed
this
is
the
language
that
rose
upon
the
ruins
of
the
latin
tongue
after
the
irruptions
of
the
goths
vandals
huns
and
burgundians
by
whom
the
roman
empire
was
destroyed
it
was
spoke
all
over
italy
spain
and
the
southern
parts
of
france
until
the
thirteenth
century
when
the
italians
began
to
polish
it
into
the
language
which
they
now
call
their
own
the
spaniards
and
french
likewise
improved
it
into
their
respective
tongues
from
its
great
affinity
to
the
latin
it
was
called
romance
a
name
which
the
spaniards
still
give
to
their
own
language
as
the
first
legends
of
were
written
in
provencal
all
subsequent
performances
of
the
same
kind
have
derived
from
it
the
name
of
romance
and
as
those
annals
of
chivalry
contained
extravagant
adventures
of
knights
giants
and
necromancers
every
improbable
story
or
fiction
is
to
this
day
called
a
romance
walpole
in
his
catalogue
of
royal
and
noble
authors
has
produced
two
sonnets
in
the
antient
provencal
written
by
our
king
richard
surnamed
coeur
de
lion
and
voltaire
in
his
historical
tracts
has
favoured
the
world
with
some
specimens
of
the
same
language
the
patois
of
nice
must
without
doubt
have
undergone
changes
and
corruptions
in
the
course
of
so
many
ages
especially
as
no
pains
have
been
taken
to
preserve
its
original
purity
either
in
orthography
or
pronunciation
it
is
neglected
as
the
language
of
the
vulgar
and
scarce
here
knows
either
its
origin
or
constitution
i
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
procure
some
pieces
in
the
antient
provencal
that
i
might
compare
them
with
the
modern
patois
but
i
can
find
no
person
to
give
me
the
least
information
on
the
subject
the
shades
of
ignorance
sloth
and
stupidity
are
impenetrable
almost
every
word
of
the
patois
may
still
be
found
in
the
italian
spanish
and
french
languages
with
a
small
change
in
the
pronunciation
cavallo
signifying
a
horse
in
italian
and
spanish
is
called
cavao
maison
the
french
word
for
a
house
is
changed
into
maion
aqua
which
means
water
in
spanish
the
nissards
call
daigua
to
express
what
a
slop
is
here
they
say
acco
fa
lac
aqui
which
is
a
sentence
composed
of
two
italian
words
one
french
and
one
spanish
this
is
nearly
the
proportion
in
which
these
three
languages
will
be
found
mingled
in
the
patois
of
nice
which
with
some
variation
extends
over
all
provence
languedoc
and
gascony
i
will
now
treat
you
with
two
or
three
stanzas
of
a
canzon
or
hymn
in
this
language
to
the
virgin

letter
xxii
nice
november
dear
sir
i
had
once
thoughts
of
writing
a
complete
natural
history
of
this
town
and
county
but
i
found
myself
altogether
unequal
to
the
task
i
have
neither
health
strength
nor
opportunity
to
make
proper
collections
of
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
productions
i
am
not
much
conversant
with
these
branches
of
natural
philosophy
i
have
no
books
to
direct
my
inquiries
i
can
find
no
person
capable
of
giving
me
the
least
information
or
assistance
and
i
am
strangely
puzzled
by
the
barbarous
names
they
give
to
many
different
species
the
descriptions
of
which
i
have
read
under
other
appelations
and
which
as
i
have
never
seen
them
before
i
can
not
pretend
to
distinguish
by
the
eye
you
must
therefore
be
contented
with
such
imperfect
intelligence
as
my
opportunities
can
afford
the
useful
arts
practised
at
nice
are
these
gardening
and
agriculture
with
their
consequences
the
making
of
wine
oil
and
cordage
the
rearing
of
with
the
subsequent
management
and
manufacture
of
that
production
and
the
fishing
which
i
have
already
described
nothing
can
be
more
unpromising
than
the
natural
soil
of
this
territory
except
in
a
very
few
narrow
bottoms
where
there
is
a
stiff
clay
which
when
carefully
watered
yields
tolerable
pasturage
in
every
other
part
the
soil
consists
of
a
light
sand
mingled
with
pebbles
which
serves
well
enough
for
the
culture
of
vines
and
olives
but
the
ground
laid
out
for
kitchen
herbs
as
well
as
for
other
fruit
must
be
manured
with
great
care
and
attention
they
have
no
black
cattle
to
afford
such
compost
as
our
farmers
use
in
england
the
dung
of
mules
and
asses
which
are
their
only
beasts
of
burthen
is
of
very
little
value
for
this
purpose
and
the
natural
sterility
of
their
ground
requires
something
highly
impregnated
with
nitre
and
volatile
salts
they
have
recourse
therefore
to
pigeons
dung
and
ordure
which
fully
answer
their
expectations
every
peasant
opens
at
one
corner
of
his
wall
a
public
house
of
office
for
the
reception
of
passengers
and
in
the
town
of
nice
every
tenement
is
provided
with
one
of
these
receptacles
the
contents
of
which
are
carefully
preserved
for
sale
the
peasant
comes
with
his
asses
and
casks
to
carry
it
off
before
day
and
pays
for
it
according
to
its
quality
which
he
examines
and
investigates
by
the
taste
and
flavour
the
jakes
of
a
protestant
family
who
eat
gras
every
day
bears
a
much
higher
price
than
the
privy
of
a
good
catholic
who
lives
maigre
one
half
of
the
year
the
vaults
belonging
to
the
convent
of
minims
are
not
worth
emptying
the
ground
here
is
not
delved
with
spades
as
in
england
but
laboured
with
a
broad
sharp
hough
having
a
short
horizontal
handle
and
the
climate
is
so
hot
and
dry
in
the
summer
that
the
plants
must
be
watered
every
morning
and
evening
especially
where
it
is
not
shaded
by
trees
it
is
surprising
to
see
how
the
productions
of
the
earth
are
crouded
together
one
would
imagine
they
would
rob
one
another
of
nourishment
and
moreover
be
stifled
for
want
of
air
and
doubtless
this
is
in
some
measure
the
case
olive
and
other
fruit
trees
are
planted
in
rows
very
close
to
each
other
these
are
connected
by
vines
and
the
interstices
between
the
rows
are
filled
with
corn
the
gardens
that
supply
the
town
with
sallad
and
lye
all
on
the
side
of
provence
by
the
highway
they
are
surrounded
with
high
or
ditches
planted
with
a
kind
of
cane
or
large
reed
which
answers
many
purposes
in
this
country
the
leaves
of
it
afford
sustenance
to
the
asses
and
the
canes
not
only
serve
as
fences
to
the
inclosures
but
are
used
to
prop
the
vines
and
pease
and
to
build
habitations
for
the
silkworms
they
are
formed
into
arbours
and
wore
as
all
these
gardens
are
watered
by
little
rills
that
come
from
the
mountains
particularly
by
the
small
branches
of
the
two
sources
which
i
have
described
in
a
former
letter
as
issuing
from
the
two
sides
of
a
mountain
under
the
names
of
fontaine
de
muraille
and
fontaine
du
temple
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nice
they
raise
a
considerable
quantity
of
hemp
the
largest
and
strongest
i
ever
saw
part
of
this
when
dressed
is
exported
to
other
countries
and
part
is
manufactured
into
cordage
however
profitable
it
may
be
to
the
grower
it
is
certainly
a
great
nuisance
in
the
summer
when
taken
out
of
the
pits
where
it
has
been
put
to
rot
the
stench
it
raises
is
quite
insupportable
and
must
undoubtedly
be
unwholesome
there
is
such
a
want
of
land
in
this
neighbourhood
that
terraces
are
built
over
one
another
with
loose
stones
on
the
faces
of
bare
rocks
and
these
being
covered
with
earth
and
manured
are
planted
with
olives
vines
and
corn
the
same
shift
was
practised
all
over
palestine
which
was
rocky
and
barren
and
much
more
populous
than
the
county
of
nice
notwithstanding
the
small
extent
of
this
territory
there
are
some
pleasant
meadows
in
the
skirts
of
nice
that
produce
excellent
clover
and
the
corn
which
is
sown
in
open
fields
where
it
has
the
full
benefit
of
the
soil
sun
and
air
grows
to
a
surprizing
height
i
have
seen
rye
seven
or
eight
feet
high
all
vegetables
have
a
wonderful
growth
in
this
climate
besides
wheat
rye
barley
and
oats
this
country
produces
a
good
deal
of
meliga
or
turkish
wheat
which
is
what
we
call
indian
corn
i
have
in
a
former
letter
observed
that
the
meal
of
this
grain
goes
by
the
name
polenta
and
makes
excellent
being
very
nourishing
and
counted
an
admirable
pectoral
the
pods
and
stalks
are
used
for
fuel
and
the
leaves
are
much
preferable
to
common
straw
for
making
paillasses
the
pease
and
beans
in
the
garden
appear
in
the
winter
like
beautiful
plantations
of
young
trees
in
blossom
and
perfume
the
air
myrtle
sage
thyme
lavender
rosemary
with
many
other
aromatic
herbs
and
flowers
which
with
us
require
the
most
careful
cultivation
are
here
found
wild
in
the
mountains
it
is
not
many
years
since
the
nissards
learned
the
culture
of
of
their
neighbours
the
piedmontese
and
hitherto
the
progress
they
have
made
is
not
very
considerable
the
whole
county
of
nice
produces
about
one
hundred
and
bales
of
three
hundred
pounds
each
amounting
in
value
to
four
hundred
thousand
livres
in
the
beginning
of
april
when
the
begin
to
put
forth
the
eggs
or
grains
that
produce
the
are
hatched
the
grains
are
washed
in
wine
and
those
that
swim
on
the
top
are
thrown
away
as
good
for
nothing
the
rest
being
deposited
in
small
bags
of
linen
are
worn
by
women
in
their
bosoms
until
the
worms
begin
to
appear
then
they
are
placed
in
shallow
wooden
boxes
covered
with
a
piece
of
white
paper
cut
into
little
holes
through
which
the
worms
ascend
as
they
are
hatched
to
feed
on
the
young
of
which
there
is
a
layer
above
the
paper
these
boxes
are
kept
for
warmth
between
two
mattrasses
and
visited
every
day
fresh
leaves
are
laid
in
and
the
worms
that
feed
are
removed
successively
to
the
other
place
prepared
for
their
reception
this
is
an
habitation
consisting
of
two
or
three
stories
about
twenty
inches
from
each
other
raised
upon
four
wooden
posts
the
floors
are
made
of
canes
and
strewed
with
fresh
the
corner
posts
and
other
occasional
props
for
sustaining
the
different
floors
are
covered
with
a
coat
of
loose
heath
which
is
twisted
round
the
wood
the
worms
when
hatched
are
laid
upon
the
floors
and
here
you
may
see
them
in
all
the
different
stages
if
moulting
or
casting
the
slough
a
change
which
they
undergo
three
times
successively
before
they
begin
to
work
the
is
an
animal
of
such
acute
and
delicate
sensations
that
too
much
care
can
not
be
taken
to
keep
its
habitation
clean
and
to
refresh
it
from
time
to
time
with
pure
air
i
have
seen
them
languish
and
die
in
scores
in
consequence
of
an
accidental
bad
smell
the
soiled
leaves
and
the
filth
which
they
necessarily
produce
should
be
carefully
shifted
every
day
and
it
would
not
be
amiss
to
purify
the
air
sometimes
with
fumes
of
vinegar
rose
or
water
these
niceties
however
are
but
little
observed
they
commonly
lie
in
heaps
as
thick
as
shrimps
in
a
plate
some
feeding
on
the
leaves
some
new
hatched
some
intranced
in
the
agonies
of
casting
their
skin
sonic
languishing
and
some
actually
dead
with
a
litter
of
faded
leaves
about
them
in
a
close
room
crouded
with
women
and
children
not
at
all
remarkable
for
their
cleanliness
i
am
assured
by
some
persons
of
credit
that
if
they
are
touched
or
even
approached
by
a
woman
in
her
catamenia
they
infallibly
expire
this
however
must
be
understood
of
those
females
whose
skins
have
naturally
a
very
rank
flavour
which
is
generally
heightened
at
such
periods
the
used
in
this
country
are
of
the
tree
which
bears
a
small
white
fruit
not
larger
than
a
damascene
they
are
planted
on
purpose
and
the
leaves
are
sold
at
so
much
a
pound
by
the
middle
of
june
all
the
are
stripped
but
new
leaves
succeed
and
in
a
few
weeks
they
are
cloathed
again
with
fresh
verdure
in
about
ten
days
after
the
last
moulting
the
climbs
upon
the
props
of
his
house
and
choosing
a
situation
among
the
heath
begins
to
spin
in
a
most
curious
manner
until
he
is
quite
inclosed
and
the
cocon
or
pod
of
silk
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
egg
which
he
has
produced
remains
suspended
by
several
filaments
it
is
no
unusual
to
see
double
cocons
spun
by
two
worms
included
under
a
common
cover
there
must
be
an
infinite
number
of
worms
to
yield
any
considerable
quantity
of
silk
one
ounce
of
eggs
or
grains
produces
four
rup
or
one
hundred
nice
pounds
of
cocons
and
one
rup
or
pounds
of
cocons
if
they
are
rich
gives
three
pounds
of
raw
silk
that
is
twelve
pounds
of
silk
are
got
from
one
ounce
of
grains
which
ounce
of
grains
its
produced
by
as
many
worms
as
are
inclosed
in
one
pound
or
twelve
ounces
of
cocons
in
preserving
the
cocons
for
breed
you
must
choose
an
equal
number
of
males
and
females
and
these
are
very
easily
distinguished
by
the
shape
of
the
cocons
that
which
contains
the
male
is
sharp
and
the
other
obtuse
at
the
two
ends
in
ten
or
twelve
days
after
the
cocon
is
finished
the
worm
makes
its
way
through
it
in
the
form
of
a
very
ugly
unwieldy
aukward
butterfly
and
as
the
different
sexes
are
placed
by
one
another
on
paper
or
linen
they
immediately
engender
the
female
lays
her
eggs
which
are
carefully
preserved
but
neither
she
nor
her
mate
takes
any
nourishment
and
in
eight
or
ten
days
after
they
quit
the
cocons
they
generally
die
the
silk
of
these
cocons
can
not
be
wound
because
the
animals
in
piercing
through
them
have
destroyed
the
continuity
of
the
filaments
it
is
therefore
first
boiled
and
then
picked
and
carded
like
wool
and
being
afterwards
spun
is
used
in
the
coarser
stuffs
of
the
silk
manufacture
the
other
cocons
which
yield
the
best
silk
are
managed
in
a
different
manner
before
the
inclosed
worm
has
time
to
penetrate
the
silk
is
reeled
off
with
equal
care
and
ingenuity
a
handful
of
the
cocons
are
thrown
away
into
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
which
not
only
kills
the
animal
but
dissolves
the
glutinous
substance
by
which
the
fine
filaments
of
the
silk
cohere
or
stick
together
so
that
they
are
easily
wound
off
without
breaking
six
or
seven
of
these
small
filaments
being
joined
together
are
passed
over
a
kind
of
twisting
iron
and
fixed
to
the
wheel
which
one
girl
turns
while
another
with
her
hands
in
the
boiling
water
disentangles
the
threads
joins
them
when
they
chance
to
break
and
supplies
fresh
cocons
with
admirable
dexterity
and
dispatch
there
is
a
manufacture
of
this
kind
just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
nice
where
forty
or
fifty
of
these
wheels
are
worked
together
and
give
employment
for
some
weeks
to
double
the
number
of
young
women
those
who
manage
the
pods
that
float
in
the
boiling
water
must
be
very
alert
otherwise
they
will
scald
their
fingers
the
smell
that
comes
from
the
boiling
cocons
is
extremely
offensive
hard
by
the
harbour
there
is
a
very
curious
mill
for
twisting
the
silk
which
goes
by
water
there
is
in
the
town
of
nice
a
well
regulated
hospital
for
poor
orphans
of
both
sexes
where
above
one
hundred
of
them
are
employed
in
dressing
dyeing
spinning
and
weaving
the
silk
in
the
villages
of
provence
you
see
the
poor
women
in
the
streets
spinning
raw
silk
upon
distaves
but
here
the
same
instrument
is
only
used
for
spinning
hemp
and
flax
which
last
however
is
not
of
the
growth
of
nice
but
lest
i
should
spin
this
letter
to
a
tedious
length
i
will
now
wind
up
my
bottom
and
bid
you
heartily
farewell
letter
xxiii
nice
december
sir
in
my
last
i
gave
you
a
succinct
account
of
the
silkworm
and
the
management
of
that
curious
insect
in
this
country
i
shall
now
proceed
to
describe
the
methods
of
making
wine
and
oil
the
vintage
begins
in
september
the
grapes
being
chosen
and
carefully
picked
are
put
into
a
large
vat
where
they
are
pressed
by
a
naked
feet
and
the
juices
drawn
off
by
a
cock
below
when
no
more
is
procured
by
this
operation
the
bruised
grapes
are
put
into
the
press
and
yield
still
more
liquor
the
juice
obtained
by
this
double
pressure
being
put
in
casks
with
their
bungs
open
begins
to
ferment
and
discharge
its
impurities
at
the
openings
the
waste
occasioned
by
this
discharge
is
constantly
supplied
with
fresh
wine
so
that
the
casks
are
always
full
the
fermentation
continues
for
twelve
fifteen
or
twenty
days
according
to
the
strength
and
vigour
of
the
grape
in
about
a
month
the
wine
is
fit
for
drinking
when
the
grapes
are
of
a
bad
meagre
kind
the
wine
dealers
mix
the
juice
with
or
in
order
to
give
it
a
spirit
which
nature
has
denied
but
this
is
a
very
mischievous
adulteration
the
process
for
is
equally
simple
the
best
olives
are
those
that
grow
wild
but
the
quantity
of
them
is
very
inconsiderable
olives
begin
to
ripen
and
drop
in
the
beginning
of
november
but
some
remain
on
the
trees
till
february
and
even
till
april
and
these
are
counted
the
most
valuable
when
the
olives
are
gathered
they
must
be
manufactured
immediately
before
they
fade
and
grow
wrinkled
otherwise
they
will
produce
bad
oil
they
are
first
of
all
ground
into
a
paste
by
a
set
in
a
circular
the
wheel
being
turned
by
water
this
paste
is
put
into
trails
or
circular
cases
made
of
grass
woven
having
a
round
hole
at
top
and
bottom
when
filled
they
resemble
in
shape
our
cheshire
cheeses
a
number
of
these
placed
one
upon
another
are
put
in
a
press
and
being
squeezed
the
oil
with
all
its
impurities
runs
into
a
receptacle
below
fixed
in
the
ground
from
hence
it
is
laded
into
a
wooden
vat
half
filled
with
water
the
sordes
or
dirt
falls
to
the
bottom
the
oil
swims
and
being
skimmed
off
is
barrelled
up
in
small
oblong
casks
what
remains
in
the
vat
is
thrown
into
a
large
stone
cistern
with
water
and
after
being
often
stirred
and
standing
twelve
or
fourteen
days
yields
a
coarser
oil
used
for
lamps
and
manufactures
after
these
processes
they
extract
an
oil
still
more
coarse
and
fetid
from
the
refuse
of
the
whole
sometimes
in
order
to
make
the
olives
grind
the
more
easily
into
a
paste
and
part
with
more
oil
they
are
mixed
with
a
little
hot
water
but
the
oil
thus
procured
is
apt
to
grow
rancid
the
very
finest
called
virgin
oil
is
made
chiefly
of
green
olives
and
sold
at
a
very
high
price
because
a
great
quantity
is
required
to
produce
a
very
little
oil
even
the
stuff
that
is
left
after
all
these
operations
consisting
of
the
dried
pulp
is
sold
for
fuel
and
used
in
brasieres
for
warming
apartments
which
have
no
chimney
i
have
now
specified
all
the
manufactures
of
nice
which
are
worth
mentioning
true
it
is
there
is
some
coarse
paper
made
in
this
neighbourhood
there
are
also
people
here
who
dress
skins
and
make
leather
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitants
but
this
business
is
very
ill
performed
the
gloves
and
shoes
are
generally
rotten
as
they
come
from
the
hands
of
the
maker
carpenter
joiner
and
blacksmith
work
is
very
coarsely
and
clumsily
done
there
are
no
chairs
to
be
had
at
nice
but
crazy
things
made
of
a
few
sticks
with
rush
bottoms
which
are
sold
for
twelve
livres
a
dozen
nothing
can
be
more
contemptible
than
the
made
in
this
place
such
as
knives
scissors
and
all
utensils
in
brass
and
copper
are
very
ill
made
and
finished
the
make
nothing
but
spoons
forks
paultry
rings
and
crosses
for
the
necks
of
the
women
the
houses
are
built
of
a
ragged
stone
dug
from
the
mountains
and
the
interstices
are
filled
with
rubble
so
that
the
walls
would
appear
very
ugly
if
they
were
not
covered
with
plaister
which
has
a
good
effect
they
generally
consist
of
three
stories
and
are
covered
with
tiles
the
apartments
of
the
better
sort
are
large
and
lofty
the
floors
paved
with
brick
the
roofs
covered
with
a
thick
coat
of
stucco
and
the
walls
whitewashed
people
of
distinction
hang
their
chambers
with
damask
striped
silk
painted
cloths
tapestry
or
printed
linnen
all
the
doors
as
well
as
the
windows
consist
of
folding
leaves
as
there
is
no
wainscot
in
the
rooms
which
are
divided
by
stone
partitions
and
the
floors
and
cieling
are
covered
with
brick
and
stucco
fires
are
of
much
less
dreadful
consequence
here
than
in
our
country
wainscot
would
afford
harbour
for
bugs
besides
white
walls
have
a
better
effect
in
this
hot
climate
the
beds
commonly
used
in
this
place
and
all
over
italy
consist
of
a
paillasse
with
one
or
two
mattrasses
laid
upon
planks
supported
by
two
wooden
benches
instead
of
curtains
there
is
a
couziniere
or
mosquito
net
made
of
a
kind
of
gauze
that
opens
and
contracts
occasionally
and
incloses
the
place
where
you
lie
persons
of
condition
however
have
also
bedsteads
and
curtains
but
these
last
are
never
used
in
the
summer
in
these
countries
people
of
all
ranks
dine
exactly
at
noon
and
this
is
the
time
i
seize
in
winter
for
making
my
daily
tour
of
the
streets
and
ramparts
which
at
all
other
hours
of
the
day
are
crowded
with
men
women
children
and
beasts
of
burthen
the
rampart
is
the
common
road
for
carriages
of
all
kinds
i
think
there
are
two
private
coaches
in
nice
besides
that
of
the
commandant
but
there
are
sedan
chairs
which
may
be
had
at
a
reasonable
rate
when
i
bathed
in
the
summer
i
paid
thirty
sols
equal
to
for
being
carried
to
and
from
the
bathing
place
which
was
a
mile
from
my
own
house
now
i
am
speaking
of
bathing
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
inform
you
that
though
there
is
a
fine
open
beach
extending
several
miles
to
the
westward
of
nice
those
who
can
not
swim
ought
to
bathe
with
great
precaution
as
the
sea
is
very
deep
and
the
descent
very
abrupt
from
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
water
edge
the
people
here
were
much
surprised
when
i
began
to
bathe
in
the
beginning
of
may
they
thought
it
very
strange
that
a
man
seemingly
consumptive
should
plunge
into
the
sea
especially
when
the
weather
was
so
cold
and
some
of
the
doctors
prognosticated
immediate
death
but
when
it
was
perceived
that
i
grew
better
in
consequence
of
the
bath
some
of
the
swiss
officers
tried
the
same
experiment
and
in
a
few
days
our
example
was
followed
by
several
inhabitants
of
nice
there
is
however
no
convenience
for
this
operation
from
the
benefit
of
which
the
fair
sex
must
be
intirely
excluded
unless
they
lay
aside
all
regard
to
decorum
for
the
shore
is
always
lined
with
and
crouded
with
people
if
a
lady
should
be
at
the
expence
of
having
a
tent
pitched
on
the
beach
where
she
might
put
on
and
of
her
she
could
not
pretend
to
go
into
the
sea
without
proper
attendants
nor
could
she
possibly
plunge
headlong
into
the
water
which
is
the
most
effectual
and
least
dangerous
way
of
bathing
all
that
she
can
do
is
to
have
the
brought
into
her
house
and
make
use
of
a
which
may
be
made
according
to
her
own
or
physician
direction
what
further
i
have
to
say
of
this
climate
and
country
you
shall
have
in
my
next
and
then
you
will
be
released
from
a
subject
which
i
am
afraid
has
been
but
too
circumstantially
handled
by
sir
your
very
humble
servant
letter
xxiv
nice
january
dear
the
constitution
of
this
climate
may
be
pretty
well
ascertained
from
the
inclosed
register
of
the
weather
which
i
kept
with
all
possible
care
and
attention
from
a
perusal
of
it
you
will
see
that
there
is
less
rain
and
wind
at
nice
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
that
i
know
and
such
is
the
serenity
of
the
air
that
you
see
nothing
above
your
head
for
several
months
together
but
a
charming
blue
expanse
without
cloud
or
speck
whatever
clouds
may
be
formed
by
evaporation
of
the
sea
they
seldom
or
never
hover
over
this
small
territory
but
in
all
probability
are
attracted
by
the
mountains
that
surround
it
and
there
fall
in
rain
or
snow
as
for
those
that
gather
from
other
quarters
i
suppose
their
progress
hitherward
is
obstructed
by
those
very
alps
which
rise
one
over
another
to
an
extent
of
many
leagues
this
air
being
dry
pure
heavy
and
elastic
must
be
agreeable
to
the
constitution
of
those
who
labour
under
disorders
arising
from
weak
nerves
obstructed
perspiration
relaxed
fibres
a
viscidity
of
lymph
and
a
languid
circulation
in
other
respects
it
encourages
the
scurvy
the
atmosphere
being
undoubtedly
impregnated
with
ever
since
my
arrival
at
nice
i
have
had
a
scorbutical
eruption
on
my
right
hand
which
diminishes
and
increases
according
to
the
state
of
my
health
one
day
last
summer
when
there
was
a
strong
breeze
from
the
sea
the
surface
of
our
bodies
was
covered
with
a
salt
brine
very
perceptible
to
the
taste
my
gums
as
well
as
those
of
another
person
in
my
family
began
to
swell
and
grow
painful
though
this
had
never
happened
before
and
i
was
seized
with
violent
pains
in
the
joints
of
my
knees
i
was
then
at
a
fronting
the
sea
and
particularly
exposed
to
the
marine
air
the
swelling
of
our
gums
subsided
as
the
wind
fell
but
what
was
very
remarkable
the
on
my
hand
disappeared
and
did
not
return
for
a
whole
month
it
is
affirmed
that
will
dissolve
and
render
the
blood
so
fluid
that
it
will
exude
through
the
coats
of
the
vessels
perhaps
the
is
a
partial
dissolution
of
it
by
that
mineral
absorbed
from
the
air
by
the
lymphatics
on
the
surface
of
the
body
and
by
those
of
the
lungs
in
respiration
certain
it
is
in
the
last
stages
of
the
the
blood
often
bursts
from
the
pores
and
this
phaenomenon
is
imputed
to
a
high
degree
of
putrefaction
sure
enough
it
is
attended
with
putrefaction
we
know
that
a
certain
quantity
of
salt
is
required
to
preserve
the
animal
juices
from
going
putrid
but
how
a
greater
quantity
should
produce
putrefaction
i
leave
to
wiser
heads
to
explain
many
people
here
have
scorbutical
complaints
though
their
teeth
are
not
affected
they
are
subject
to
eruptions
on
the
skin
putrid
gums
pains
in
the
bones
lassitude
indigestion
and
low
spirits
but
the
reigning
distemper
is
a
marasmus
or
consumption
which
proceeds
gradually
without
any
pulmonary
complaint
the
complexion
growing
more
and
more
florid
the
very
last
scene
of
the
tragedy
this
i
would
impute
to
the
effects
of
a
very
dry
saline
atmosphere
upon
a
thin
habit
in
which
there
is
an
extraordinary
waste
by
perspiration
the
air
is
remarkably
salt
in
this
district
because
the
mountains
that
hem
it
in
prevent
its
communication
with
the
circumambient
atmosphere
in
which
the
saline
particles
would
otherwise
be
diffused
and
there
is
no
rain
nor
dew
to
precipitate
or
dissolve
them
such
an
air
as
i
have
described
should
have
no
bad
effect
upon
a
moist
phlegmatic
constitution
such
as
mine
and
yet
it
must
be
owned
i
have
been
visibly
wasting
since
i
came
hither
though
this
decay
i
considered
as
the
progress
of
the
tabes
which
began
in
england
but
the
air
of
nice
has
had
a
still
more
sensible
effect
upon
sch
z
who
laboured
under
nervous
complaints
to
such
a
degree
that
life
was
a
burthen
to
him
he
had
also
a
fixed
pain
in
his
breast
for
which
complaint
he
had
formerly
tried
the
air
of
naples
where
he
resided
some
considerable
time
and
in
a
great
measure
recovered
but
this
returning
with
weakness
faintness
low
spirits
and
entire
loss
of
appetite
he
was
advised
to
come
hither
and
the
success
of
his
journey
has
greatly
exceeded
his
expectation
though
the
weather
has
been
remarkably
bad
for
this
climate
he
has
enjoyed
perfect
health
since
he
arrived
at
nice
the
pain
in
his
breast
has
vanished
he
eats
heartily
sleeps
well
is
in
high
spirits
and
so
strong
that
he
is
never
off
his
legs
in
the
he
can
walk
to
the
var
and
back
again
before
dinner
and
he
has
climbed
to
the
tops
of
all
the
mountains
in
this
neighbourhood
i
never
saw
before
such
sudden
and
happy
effects
from
the
change
of
air
i
must
also
acknowledge
that
ever
since
my
arrival
at
nice
i
have
breathed
more
freely
than
i
had
done
for
some
years
and
my
spirits
have
been
more
alert
the
father
of
my
housekeeper
who
was
a
had
been
so
afflicted
with
an
asthmatic
disorder
that
he
could
not
live
in
france
spain
or
italy
but
found
the
air
of
nice
so
agreeable
to
his
lungs
that
he
was
enabled
to
exercise
his
profession
for
above
twenty
years
and
died
last
spring
turned
of
seventy
another
advantage
i
have
reaped
from
this
climate
is
my
being
in
a
great
measure
delivered
from
a
slow
fever
which
used
to
hang
about
me
and
render
life
a
burthen
neither
am
i
so
apt
to
catch
cold
as
i
used
to
be
in
england
and
france
and
the
colds
i
do
catch
are
not
of
the
same
continuance
and
consequence
as
those
to
which
i
was
formerly
subject
the
air
of
nice
is
so
dry
that
in
summer
and
even
in
winter
except
ill
wet
weather
you
may
pass
the
evening
and
indeed
the
whole
night
sub
dio
without
feeling
the
least
dew
or
moisture
and
as
for
fogs
they
are
never
seen
in
this
district
in
summer
the
air
is
cooled
by
a
regular
blowing
from
the
cast
like
that
of
the
it
begins
in
the
forenoon
and
increases
with
the
heat
of
the
day
it
dies
away
about
six
or
seven
and
immediately
after
is
succeeded
by
an
agreeable
from
the
mountains
the
from
the
eastward
however
is
not
so
constant
here
as
in
the
between
the
tropicks
because
the
sun
which
produces
it
is
not
so
powerful
this
country
lies
nearer
the
region
of
variable
winds
and
is
surrounded
by
mountains
capes
and
straights
which
often
influence
the
constitution
and
current
of
the
air
about
the
winter
solstice
the
people
of
nice
expect
wind
and
rain
which
generally
lasts
with
intervals
the
beginning
of
february
but
even
during
this
their
worst
weather
the
sun
breaks
out
occasionally
and
you
may
take
the
air
either
or
on
horseback
every
day
for
the
moisture
is
immediately
absorbed
by
the
earth
which
is
naturally
dry
they
likewise
lay
their
account
with
being
visited
by
showers
of
rain
and
gusts
of
wind
in
april
a
rain
in
the
middle
of
august
makes
them
happy
it
not
only
refreshes
the
parched
ground
and
plumps
up
the
grapes
and
other
fruit
but
it
cools
the
air
and
assuages
the
beets
which
then
begin
to
grow
very
troublesome
but
the
rainy
season
is
about
the
autumnal
equinox
or
rather
something
later
it
continues
about
twelve
days
or
a
fortnight
and
is
extremely
welcome
to
the
natives
of
this
country
this
rainy
season
is
often
delayed
the
latter
end
of
november
and
sometimes
the
month
of
december
in
which
case
the
rest
of
the
winter
is
generally
dry
the
heavy
rains
in
this
country
generally
come
with
a
wind
which
was
the
creberque
procellis
africus
the
stormy
southwest
of
the
antients
it
is
here
called
lebeche
a
corruption
of
lybicus
it
generally
blows
high
for
a
day
or
two
and
rolls
the
mediterranean
before
it
in
huge
waves
that
often
enter
the
town
of
nice
it
likewise
drives
before
it
all
the
clouds
which
had
been
formed
above
the
surface
of
the
mediterranean
these
being
expended
in
rain
fair
weather
naturally
ensues
for
this
reason
the
nissards
observe
le
lebeche
racommode
le
tems
the
lebeche
settles
the
weather
during
the
rains
of
this
season
however
the
winds
have
been
variable
from
the
sixteenth
of
november
the
fourth
of
january
we
have
had
two
and
twenty
days
of
heavy
rain
a
very
extraordinary
visitation
in
this
country
but
the
seasons
seem
to
be
more
irregular
than
formerly
all
over
europe
in
the
month
of
july
the
mercury
in
thermometer
rose
to
at
rome
the
highest
degree
at
which
it
was
ever
known
in
that
country
and
the
very
next
day
the
sabine
mountains
were
covered
with
snow
the
same
phaemomenon
happened
on
the
eleventh
of
august
and
the
thirtieth
of
september
the
consequence
of
these
sudden
variations
of
weather
was
this
putrid
fevers
were
less
frequent
than
usual
but
the
sudden
cheek
of
perspiration
from
the
cold
produced
colds
inflammatory
sore
throats
and
the
rheumatism
i
know
instances
of
some
english
valetudinarians
who
have
passed
the
winter
at
aix
on
the
supposition
that
there
was
little
or
no
difference
between
that
air
and
the
climate
of
nice
but
this
is
a
very
great
mistake
which
may
be
attended
with
fatal
consequences
aix
is
altogether
exposed
to
the
north
and
winds
which
blow
as
cold
in
provence
as
ever
i
felt
them
on
the
mountains
of
scotland
whereas
nice
is
entirely
screened
from
these
winds
by
the
maritime
alps
which
form
an
amphitheatre
to
the
around
this
little
territory
but
another
incontestible
proof
of
the
mildness
of
this
climate
is
deduced
from
the
oranges
lemons
citrons
roses
narcissus
and
jonquils
which
ripen
and
blow
in
the
middle
of
winter
i
have
described
the
agreeable
side
of
this
climate
and
now
i
will
point
out
its
inconveniences
in
the
winter
but
especially
in
the
spring
the
sun
is
so
hot
that
one
can
hardly
take
exercise
of
any
sort
abroad
without
being
thrown
into
a
breathing
sweat
and
the
wind
at
this
season
is
so
cold
and
piercing
that
it
often
produces
a
mischievous
effect
on
the
pores
thus
opened
if
the
heat
rarifies
the
blood
and
juices
while
the
cold
air
constringes
the
fibres
and
obstructs
the
perspiration
inflammatory
disorders
must
ensue
accordingly
the
people
are
then
subject
to
colds
pleurisies
peripneumonies
and
ardent
fevers
an
old
count
advised
me
to
stay
within
doors
in
march
car
alors
les
humeurs
commencent
a
se
remuer
for
then
the
humours
begin
to
be
in
motion
during
the
heats
of
summer
some
few
persons
of
gross
habits
have
in
consequence
of
violent
exercise
and
excess
been
seized
with
putrid
fevers
attended
with
exanthemata
erisipelatous
and
miliary
eruptions
which
commonly
prove
fatal
but
the
people
in
general
are
healthy
even
those
that
take
very
little
exercise
a
strong
presumption
in
favour
of
the
climate
as
to
medicine
i
know
nothing
of
the
practice
of
the
nice
physicians
here
are
eleven
in
all
but
four
or
five
make
shift
to
live
by
the
profession
they
receive
by
way
of
fee
ten
sols
an
english
a
visit
and
this
is
but
ill
paid
so
you
may
guess
whether
they
are
in
a
condition
to
support
the
dignity
of
physic
and
whether
any
man
of
a
liberal
education
would
bury
himself
at
nice
on
such
terms
i
am
acquainted
with
an
italian
physician
settled
at
villa
franca
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
who
practises
for
a
certain
salary
raised
by
annual
contribution
among
the
better
sort
of
people
and
an
allowance
from
the
king
for
visiting
the
sick
belonging
to
the
garrison
and
the
gallies
the
whole
may
amount
to
near
thirty
pounds
among
the
inconveniences
of
this
climate
the
vermin
form
no
inconsiderable
article
vipers
and
snakes
are
found
in
the
mountains
our
gardens
swarm
with
lizzards
and
there
are
some
few
scorpions
but
as
yet
i
have
seen
but
one
of
this
species
in
summer
notwithstanding
all
the
care
and
precautions
we
can
take
we
are
pestered
with
incredible
swarms
of
flies
fleas
and
bugs
but
the
gnats
or
couzins
are
more
intolerable
than
all
the
rest
in
the
it
is
impossible
to
keep
the
flies
out
of
your
mouth
nostrils
eyes
and
ears
they
croud
into
your
milk
tea
chocolate
soup
wine
and
water
they
soil
your
sugar
contaminate
your
victuals
and
devour
your
fruit
they
cover
and
defile
your
furniture
floors
cielings
and
indeed
your
whole
body
as
soon
as
candles
are
lighted
the
couzins
begin
to
buz
about
your
ears
in
myriads
and
torment
you
with
their
stings
so
that
you
have
no
rest
nor
respite
you
get
into
bed
where
you
are
secured
by
your
this
inclosure
is
very
disagreeable
in
hot
weather
and
very
inconvenient
to
those
who
like
me
are
subject
to
a
cough
and
spitting
it
is
moreover
ineffectual
for
some
of
those
cursed
insects
insinuate
themselves
within
it
almost
every
night
and
half
a
dozen
of
them
are
sufficient
to
disturb
you
morning
this
is
a
plague
that
continues
all
the
year
but
in
summer
it
is
intolerable
during
this
season
likewise
the
moths
are
so
mischievous
that
it
requires
the
utmost
care
to
preserve
woollen
cloths
from
being
destroyed
from
the
month
of
may
the
beginning
of
october
the
heat
is
so
violent
that
you
can
not
stir
abroad
after
six
in
the
morning
eight
at
night
so
that
you
are
entirely
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
exercise
there
is
no
shaded
walk
in
or
near
the
town
and
there
is
neither
coach
nor
chaise
to
hire
unless
you
travel
post
indeed
there
is
no
road
fit
for
any
wheel
carriage
but
the
common
highway
to
the
var
in
which
you
are
scorched
by
the
reflexion
of
the
sun
from
the
sand
and
stones
and
at
the
same
time
half
stifled
with
dust
if
you
ride
out
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
you
will
have
the
disadvantage
of
returning
in
the
dark
among
the
demerits
of
nice
i
must
also
mention
the
water
which
is
used
in
the
city
it
is
drawn
from
wells
and
for
the
most
part
so
hard
that
it
curdles
with
soap
there
are
many
fountains
and
streams
in
the
neighbourhood
that
afford
excellent
water
which
at
no
great
charge
might
be
conveyed
into
the
town
so
as
to
form
conduits
in
all
the
public
streets
but
the
inhabitants
are
either
destitute
of
public
spirit
or
can
not
afford
the
expense
general
paterson
delivered
a
plan
to
the
king
of
sardinia
for
supplying
nice
with
excellent
water
for
so
small
an
expence
as
one
livre
a
house
per
annum
but
the
inhabitants
remonstrated
against
it
as
an
intolerable
imposition
i
have
a
in
my
porch
and
another
in
my
garden
which
supply
tolerable
water
for
culinary
uses
but
what
we
drink
is
fetched
from
a
well
belonging
to
a
convent
of
dominicans
in
this
neighbourhood
our
linnen
is
washed
in
the
river
paglion
and
when
that
is
dry
in
the
brook
called
limpia
which
runs
into
the
harbour
in
mentioning
the
water
of
this
neighbourhood
i
ought
not
to
omit
the
baths
of
rocabiliare
a
small
town
among
the
mountains
about
five
and
twenty
miles
from
nice
there
are
three
sources
each
warmer
than
the
other
the
warmest
being
nearly
equal
to
the
heat
of
the
king
bath
at
bath
in
somersetshire
as
far
as
i
can
judge
from
information
i
have
perused
a
latin
manuscript
which
treats
of
these
baths
at
rocabiliare
written
by
the
duke
of
savoy
first
physician
about
sixty
years
ago
he
talks
much
of
the
sulphur
and
the
nitre
which
they
contain
but
i
apprehend
their
efficacy
is
owing
to
the
same
volatile
vitriolic
principle
which
characterises
the
waters
at
bath
they
are
attenuating
and
deobstruent
consequently
of
service
in
disorders
arising
from
a
languid
circulation
a
viscidity
of
the
juices
a
lax
fibre
and
obstructed
viscera
the
road
from
hence
to
rocabiliare
is
in
some
parts
very
dangerous
lying
along
the
brink
of
precipices
impassable
to
any
other
carriage
but
a
mule
the
town
itself
affords
bad
lodging
and
accommodation
and
little
or
no
society
the
waters
are
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
town
there
are
no
baths
nor
shelter
nor
any
sort
of
convenience
for
those
that
drink
them
and
the
best
part
of
their
efficacy
is
lost
unless
they
are
drank
at
the
if
these
objections
were
in
some
measure
removed
i
would
advise
valetudinarians
who
come
hither
for
the
benefit
of
this
climate
to
pass
the
heats
of
summer
at
rocabiliare
which
being
situated
among
mountains
enjoys
a
cool
temperate
air
all
the
summer
this
would
be
a
salutary
respite
from
the
salt
air
of
nice
to
those
who
labour
under
scorbutical
complaints
and
they
would
return
with
fresh
vigour
and
spirits
to
pass
the
winter
in
this
place
where
no
severity
of
weather
is
known
last
june
when
i
found
myself
so
ill
at
my
cassine
i
had
determined
to
go
to
rocabiliare
and
even
to
erect
a
hut
at
the
spring
for
my
own
convenience
a
gentleman
of
nice
undertook
to
procure
me
a
tolerable
lodging
in
the
house
of
the
cure
who
was
his
relation
he
assured
me
there
was
no
want
of
fresh
butter
good
poultry
excellent
veal
and
delicate
trout
and
that
the
articles
of
living
might
be
had
at
rocabiliare
for
half
the
price
we
paid
at
nice
but
finding
myself
grow
better
immediately
on
my
return
from
the
cassine
to
my
own
house
i
would
not
put
myself
to
the
trouble
and
expence
of
a
further
removal
i
think
i
have
now
communicated
all
the
particulars
relating
to
nice
that
are
worth
knowing
and
perhaps
many
more
than
you
desired
to
know
but
in
such
cases
i
would
rather
be
thought
prolix
and
unentertaining
than
deficient
in
that
regard
and
attention
with
which
i
am
very
sincerely
your
friend
and
servant
letter
xxv
nice
january
dear
sir
it
was
in
deference
to
your
opinion
reinforced
by
my
own
inclination
and
the
repeated
advice
of
other
friends
that
i
resolved
upon
my
late
excursion
to
italy
i
could
plainly
perceive
from
the
anxious
solicitude
and
pressing
exhortations
contained
in
all
the
letters
i
had
lately
received
from
my
correspondents
in
britain
that
you
had
all
despaired
of
my
recovery
you
advised
me
to
make
a
pilgrimage
among
the
alps
and
the
advice
was
good
in
scrambling
among
those
mountains
i
should
have
benefited
by
the
exercise
and
at
the
same
time
have
breathed
a
cool
pure
salubrious
air
which
in
all
probability
would
have
expelled
the
slow
fever
arising
in
a
great
measure
from
the
heat
of
this
climate
but
i
wanted
a
companion
and
fellow
traveller
whose
conversation
and
society
could
alleviate
the
horrors
of
solitude
besides
i
was
not
strong
enough
to
encounter
the
want
of
conveniences
and
even
of
necessaries
to
which
i
must
have
been
exposed
in
the
course
of
such
an
expedition
my
worthy
friend
a
earnestly
intreated
me
to
try
the
effect
of
a
which
you
know
has
been
found
of
wonderful
efficacy
in
consumptive
cases
after
some
deliberation
i
resolved
upon
the
scheme
which
i
have
now
happily
executed
i
had
a
most
eager
curiosity
to
see
the
antiquities
of
florence
and
rome
i
longed
impatiently
to
view
those
wonderful
edifices
statues
and
pictures
which
i
had
so
often
admired
in
prints
and
descriptions
i
felt
an
enthusiastic
ardor
to
tread
that
very
classical
ground
which
had
been
the
scene
of
so
many
great
atchievements
and
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
returning
to
england
from
the
very
skirts
of
italy
without
having
penetrated
to
the
capital
of
that
renowned
country
with
regard
to
my
health
i
knew
i
could
manage
matters
so
as
to
enjoy
all
the
benefits
that
could
be
expected
from
the
united
energy
of
a
voyage
by
sea
a
journey
by
land
and
a
change
of
climate
rome
is
betwixt
four
and
five
hundred
miles
distant
from
nice
and
one
half
of
the
way
i
was
resolved
to
travel
by
water
indeed
there
is
no
other
way
of
going
from
hence
to
genoa
unless
you
take
a
mule
and
clamber
along
the
mountains
at
the
rate
of
two
miles
an
hour
and
at
the
risque
of
breaking
your
neck
every
minute
the
apennine
mountains
which
are
no
other
than
a
continuation
of
the
maritime
alps
form
an
almost
continued
precipice
from
villefranche
to
lerici
which
is
almost
miles
on
the
other
side
of
genoa
and
as
they
are
generally
washed
by
the
sea
there
is
no
beach
or
shore
consequently
the
road
is
carried
along
the
face
of
the
rocks
except
at
certain
small
intervals
which
are
occupied
by
towns
and
villages
but
as
there
is
a
road
for
mules
and
foot
passengers
it
might
certainly
be
enlarged
and
improved
so
as
to
render
it
practicable
by
chaises
and
other
and
a
toll
might
be
exacted
which
in
a
little
time
would
defray
the
expence
for
certainly
no
person
who
travels
to
italy
from
england
holland
france
or
spain
would
make
a
troublesome
circuit
to
pass
the
alps
by
the
way
of
savoy
and
piedmont
if
he
could
have
the
convenience
of
going
post
by
the
way
of
aix
antibes
and
nice
along
the
side
of
the
mediterranean
and
through
the
riviera
of
genoa
which
from
the
sea
affords
the
most
agreeable
and
amazing
prospect
i
ever
beheld
what
pity
it
is
they
can
not
restore
the
celebrated
via
aurelia
mentioned
in
the
itinerarium
of
antoninus
which
extended
from
rome
by
the
way
of
genoa
and
through
this
country
as
far
as
arles
upon
the
rhone
it
was
said
to
have
been
made
by
the
emperor
marcus
aurelius
and
some
of
the
vestiges
of
it
are
still
to
be
seen
in
provence
the
truth
is
the
nobility
of
genoa
who
are
all
merchants
from
a
low
selfish
and
absurd
policy
take
all
methods
to
keep
their
subjects
of
the
riviera
in
poverty
and
dependence
with
this
view
they
carefully
avoid
all
steps
towards
rendering
that
country
accessible
by
land
and
at
the
same
time
discourage
their
trade
by
sea
lest
it
should
interfere
with
the
commerce
of
their
capital
in
which
they
themselves
are
personally
concerned
those
who
either
will
not
or
can
not
bear
the
sea
and
are
equally
averse
to
riding
may
be
carried
in
a
common
chair
provided
with
a
on
men
shoulders
this
is
the
way
of
travelling
practised
by
the
ladies
of
nice
in
crossing
the
mountains
to
turin
but
it
is
very
tedious
and
expensive
as
the
men
must
be
often
relieved
the
most
agreeable
carriage
from
here
to
genoa
is
a
feluca
or
open
boat
rowed
by
ten
or
twelve
stout
mariners
though
none
of
these
boats
belong
to
nice
they
are
to
be
found
every
day
in
our
harbour
waiting
for
a
fare
to
genoa
and
they
are
seen
passing
and
repassing
continually
with
merchandize
or
passengers
between
marseilles
antibes
and
the
genoese
territories
a
feluca
is
large
enough
to
take
in
a
and
there
is
a
tilt
over
the
stern
sheets
where
the
passengers
sit
to
protect
them
from
the
rain
between
the
seats
one
person
may
lie
commodiously
upon
a
mattress
which
is
commonly
supplied
by
the
patron
a
man
in
good
health
may
put
up
with
any
thing
but
i
would
advise
every
valetudinarian
who
travels
this
way
to
provide
his
own
chaise
mattrass
and
bedlinnen
otherwise
he
will
pass
his
time
very
uncomfortably
if
you
go
as
a
simple
passenger
in
a
feluca
you
pay
about
a
for
your
place
and
you
must
be
intirely
under
the
direction
of
the
patron
who
while
he
can
bear
the
sea
will
prosecute
his
voyage
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
expose
you
to
many
other
inconveniencies
but
for
eight
zequines
or
four
you
can
have
a
whole
feluca
to
yourself
from
nice
to
genoa
and
the
master
shall
be
obliged
to
put
every
evening
if
you
would
have
it
still
more
at
your
command
you
may
hire
it
at
so
much
per
day
and
in
that
case
go
on
shore
as
often
and
stay
as
long
as
you
please
this
is
the
method
i
should
take
were
i
to
make
the
voyage
again
for
i
am
persuaded
i
should
find
it
very
near
as
cheap
and
much
more
agreeable
than
any
other
the
distance
between
this
place
and
genoa
when
measured
on
the
carte
does
not
exceed
ninety
miles
but
the
people
of
the
felucas
insist
upon
its
being
one
hundred
and
twenty
if
they
creep
along
shore
round
the
bottoms
of
all
the
bays
this
computation
may
be
true
but
except
when
the
sea
is
rough
they
stretch
directly
from
one
to
another
and
even
when
the
wind
is
contrary
provided
the
gale
is
not
fresh
they
perform
the
voyage
in
two
days
and
a
half
by
dint
of
rowing
when
the
wind
is
favourable
they
will
sail
it
easily
in
fourteen
hours
a
man
who
has
nothing
but
expedition
in
view
may
go
with
the
courier
who
has
always
a
light
boat
well
manned
and
will
be
glad
to
accommodate
a
traveller
for
a
reasonable
gratification
i
know
an
english
gentleman
who
always
travels
with
the
courier
in
italy
both
by
sea
and
land
in
posting
by
land
he
is
always
sure
of
having
part
of
a
good
calash
and
the
best
horses
that
can
be
found
and
as
the
expence
of
both
is
defrayed
by
the
public
it
costs
him
nothing
but
a
present
to
his
companion
which
does
not
amount
to
one
fourth
part
of
the
expence
he
would
incur
by
travelling
alone
these
opportunities
may
be
had
every
week
in
all
the
towns
of
italy
for
my
own
part
i
hired
a
gondola
from
hence
to
genoa
this
is
a
boat
smaller
than
a
feluca
rowed
by
four
men
and
steered
by
the
patron
but
the
price
was
nine
zequines
rather
more
than
i
should
have
payed
for
a
feluca
of
ten
oars
i
was
assured
that
being
very
light
it
would
make
great
way
and
the
master
was
particularly
recommended
to
me
as
an
honest
man
and
an
able
mariner
i
was
accompanied
in
this
voyage
by
my
wife
and
miss
c
together
with
one
r
a
native
of
nice
whom
i
treated
with
the
jaunt
in
hopes
that
as
he
was
acquainted
with
the
customs
of
the
country
and
the
different
ways
of
travelling
in
it
he
would
save
us
much
trouble
and
some
expence
but
i
was
much
disappointed
some
persons
at
nice
offered
to
lay
wagers
that
he
would
return
by
himself
from
italy
but
they
were
also
disappointed
we
embarked
in
the
beginning
of
september
attended
by
one
servant
the
heats
which
render
travelling
dangerous
in
italy
begin
to
abate
at
this
season
the
weather
was
extremely
agreeable
and
if
i
had
postponed
my
voyage
a
little
longer
i
foresaw
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
return
before
winter
in
which
case
i
might
have
found
the
sea
too
rough
and
the
weather
too
cold
for
a
voyage
of
one
hundred
and
miles
in
an
open
boat
having
therefore
provided
myself
with
a
proper
pass
signed
and
sealed
by
our
consul
as
well
as
with
letters
of
recommendation
from
him
to
the
english
consuls
at
genoa
and
leghorn
a
precaution
which
i
would
advise
all
travellers
to
take
in
case
of
meeting
with
accidents
on
the
road
we
went
on
board
about
ten
in
the
morning
stopped
about
half
an
hour
at
a
friend
in
the
bay
of
hospice
and
about
noon
entered
the
harbour
of
monaco
where
the
patron
was
obliged
to
pay
toll
according
to
the
regulation
which
i
have
explained
in
a
former
letter
this
small
town
containing
about
eight
or
nine
hundred
souls
besides
the
garrison
is
built
on
a
rock
which
projects
into
the
sea
and
makes
a
very
romantic
appearance
the
prince
palace
stands
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
with
a
walk
of
trees
before
it
the
apartments
are
elegantly
furnished
and
adorned
with
some
good
pictures
the
fortifications
are
in
good
repair
and
the
place
is
garrisoned
by
two
french
battalions
the
present
prince
of
monaco
is
a
frenchman
son
of
the
duke
matignon
who
married
the
heiress
of
monaco
whose
name
was
grimaldi
the
harbour
is
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
but
has
not
water
sufficient
to
admit
vessels
of
any
great
burthen
towards
the
north
the
king
of
sardinia
territories
extend
to
within
a
mile
of
the
gate
but
the
prince
of
monaco
can
go
upon
his
own
ground
along
shore
about
five
or
six
miles
to
the
eastward
as
far
as
menton
another
small
town
which
also
belongs
to
him
and
is
situated
on
the
seaside
his
revenues
are
computed
at
a
million
of
french
livres
amounting
to
something
more
than
forty
thousand
pounds
sterling
but
the
principality
of
monaco
consisting
of
three
small
towns
and
an
inconsiderable
tract
of
barren
rock
is
not
worth
above
seven
thousand
a
year
the
rest
arises
from
his
french
estate
this
consists
partly
of
the
dutchy
of
matignon
and
partly
of
the
dutchy
of
valentinois
which
last
was
given
to
the
ancestors
of
this
prince
of
monaco
in
the
year
by
the
french
king
to
make
up
the
loss
of
some
lands
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
which
were
confiscated
when
he
expelled
the
spanish
garrison
from
monaco
and
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
france
so
that
he
is
duke
of
valentinois
as
well
as
of
matignon
in
that
kingdom
he
lives
almost
constantly
in
france
and
has
taken
the
name
and
arms
of
grimaldi
the
genoese
territories
begin
at
ventimiglia
another
town
lying
on
the
coast
at
the
distance
of
twenty
miles
from
nice
a
circumstance
from
which
it
borrows
the
name
having
passed
the
towns
of
monaco
menton
ventimiglia
and
several
other
places
of
less
consequence
that
lie
along
this
coast
we
turned
the
point
of
martin
with
a
favourable
breeze
and
might
have
proceeded
twenty
miles
further
before
night
but
the
women
began
to
be
sick
as
well
as
afraid
at
the
roughness
of
the
water
r
was
so
discomposed
that
he
privately
desired
the
patron
to
put
ashore
at
remo
on
pretence
that
we
should
not
find
a
tolerable
auberge
in
any
other
place
between
this
and
noli
which
was
at
the
distance
of
forty
miles
we
accordingly
landed
and
were
conducted
to
the
poste
which
our
gondeliere
assured
us
was
the
best
auberge
in
the
whole
riviera
of
genoa
we
ascended
by
a
dark
narrow
steep
stair
into
a
kind
of
public
room
with
a
long
table
and
benches
so
dirty
and
miserable
that
it
would
disgrace
the
worst
hedge
in
england
not
a
soul
appeared
to
receive
us
this
is
a
ceremony
one
must
not
expect
to
meet
with
in
france
far
less
in
italy
our
patron
going
into
the
kitchen
asked
a
servant
if
the
company
could
have
lodging
in
the
house
and
was
answered
he
could
not
tell
the
patron
was
not
at
home
when
he
desired
to
know
where
the
patron
was
the
other
answered
he
was
gone
to
take
the
air
e
andato
a
passeggiare
in
the
mean
time
we
were
obliged
to
sit
in
the
common
room
among
watermen
and
muleteers
at
length
the
landlord
arrived
and
gave
us
to
understand
that
he
could
accommodate
us
with
chambers
in
that
where
i
lay
there
was
just
room
for
two
beds
without
curtains
or
bedstead
an
old
rotten
table
covered
with
dried
figs
and
a
couple
of
crazy
chairs
the
walls
had
been
once
but
were
now
hung
with
cobwebs
and
speckled
with
dirt
of
all
sorts
and
i
believe
the
had
not
been
swept
for
half
a
century
we
supped
in
an
outward
room
suitable
in
all
respects
to
the
chamber
and
fared
villainously
the
provision
was
very
and
served
up
in
the
most
slovenly
manner
you
must
not
expect
cleanliness
or
conveniency
of
any
kind
in
this
country
for
this
accommodation
i
payed
as
much
as
if
i
had
been
elegantly
entertained
in
the
best
auberge
of
france
or
italy
next
day
the
wind
was
so
high
that
we
could
not
prosecute
our
voyage
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
pass
other
four
and
twenty
hours
in
this
comfortable
situation
luckily
r
found
two
acquaintances
in
the
place
one
a
franciscan
monk
a
jolly
fellow
and
the
other
a
maestro
di
capella
who
sent
a
spinnet
to
the
inn
and
entertained
us
agreeably
with
his
voice
and
performance
in
both
of
which
accomplishments
he
excelled
the
padre
was
very
good
humoured
and
favoured
us
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
a
friend
of
his
a
professor
in
the
university
of
pisa
you
would
laugh
to
see
the
hyperbolical
terms
in
which
he
mentioned
your
humble
servant
but
italy
is
the
native
country
of
hyperbole
remo
is
a
pretty
considerable
town
upon
the
declivity
of
a
gently
rising
hill
and
has
a
harbour
capable
of
receiving
small
vessels
a
good
number
of
which
are
built
upon
the
beach
but
ships
of
any
burden
are
obliged
to
anchor
in
the
bay
which
is
far
from
being
secure
the
people
of
remo
form
a
small
republic
which
is
subject
to
genoa
they
enjoyed
particular
privileges
till
the
year
when
in
consequence
of
a
new
gabelle
upon
salt
they
revolted
but
this
effort
in
behalf
of
liberty
did
not
succeed
they
were
soon
reduced
by
the
genoese
who
deprived
them
of
all
their
privileges
and
built
a
fort
by
the
which
serves
the
double
purpose
of
defending
the
harbour
and
the
town
the
garrison
at
present
does
not
exceed
two
hundred
men
the
inhabitants
are
said
to
have
lately
sent
a
deputation
to
ratisbon
to
crave
the
protection
of
the
diet
of
the
empire
there
is
very
little
plain
ground
in
this
neighbourhood
but
the
hills
are
covered
with
oranges
lemons
pomegranates
and
olives
which
produce
a
considerable
traffic
in
fine
fruit
and
excellent
oil
the
women
of
remo
are
much
more
handsome
and
better
tempered
than
those
of
provence
they
have
in
general
good
eyes
with
open
ingenuous
countenances
their
dress
though
remarkable
i
can
not
describe
but
upon
the
whole
they
put
me
in
mind
of
some
portraits
i
have
seen
representing
the
females
of
georgia
and
mingrelia
on
the
third
day
the
wind
being
abated
though
still
unfavourable
we
reimbarked
and
rowed
along
shore
passing
by
and
oneglia
then
turning
the
promontory
called
capo
di
melle
we
proceeded
by
albenga

many
other
places

finale
is
the
capital
of
a
marquisate
belonging
to
the
genoese
which
has
been
the
source
of
much
trouble
to
the
republic
and
indeed
was
the
sole
cause
of
their
rupture
with
the
king
of
sardinia
and
the
house
of
austria
in
the
year
the
town
is
pretty
well
built
but
the
harbour
is
shallow
open
and
unsafe
nevertheless
they
built
a
good
number
of
tartans
and
other
vessels
on
the
beach
and
the
neighbouring
country
abounds
with
oil
and
fruit
particularly
with
those
excellent
apples
called
pomi
carli
which
i
have
mentioned
in
a
former
letter
in
the
evening
we
reached
the
capo
di
noli
counted
very
dangerous
in
blowing
weather
it
is
a
very
high
perpendicular
rock
or
mountain
washed
by
the
sea
which
has
eaten
into
it
in
divers
places
so
as
to
form
a
great
number
of
caverns
it
extends
about
a
couple
of
miles
and
in
some
parts
is
indented
into
little
creeks
or
bays
where
there
is
a
narrow
margin
of
sandy
beach
between
it
and
the
water
when
the
wind
is
high
no
feluca
will
attempt
to
pass
it
even
in
a
moderate
breeze
the
waves
dashing
against
the
rocks
and
caverns
which
echo
with
the
sound
make
such
an
awful
noise
and
at
the
same
time
occasion
such
a
rough
sea
as
one
can
not
hear
and
see
and
feel
without
a
secret
horror
on
this
side
of
the
cape
there
is
a
beautiful
strand
cultivated
like
a
garden
the
plantations
extend
to
the
very
tops
of
the
hills
interspersed
with
villages
castles
churches
and
villas
indeed
the
whole
riviera
is
ornamented
in
the
same
manner
except
in
such
places
as
admit
of
no
building
nor
cultivation
having
passed
the
cape
we
followed
the
winding
of
the
coast
into
a
small
bay
and
arrived
at
the
town
of
noli
where
we
proposed
to
pass
the
night
you
will
be
surprised
that
we
did
not
go
ashore
sooner
in
order
to
take
some
refreshment
but
the
truth
is
we
had
a
provision
of
ham
tongues
roasted
pullets
cheese
bread
wine
and
fruit
in
the
feluca
where
we
every
day
enjoyed
a
slight
repast
about
one
or
two
in
the
afternoon
this
i
mention
as
a
necessary
piece
of
information
to
those
who
may
be
inclined
to
follow
the
same
route
we
likewise
found
it
convenient
to
lay
in
store
of
de
vie
or
brandy
for
the
use
of
the
rowers
who
always
expect
to
share
your
comforts
on
a
meagre
day
however
those
ragamuffins
will
rather
die
of
hunger
than
suffer
the
least
morsel
of
to
enter
their
mouths
i
have
frequently
tried
the
experiment
by
pressing
them
to
eat
something
gras
on
a
friday
or
saturday
but
they
always
declined
it
with
marks
of
abhorrence
crying
dio
me
ne
libere
god
deliver
me
from
it
or
some
other
words
to
that
effect
i
moreover
observed
that
not
one
of
those
fellows
ever
swore
an
oath
or
spoke
an
indecent
word
they
would
by
no
means
put
to
sea
of
a
morning
before
they
had
heard
mass
and
when
the
wind
was
unfavourable
they
always
set
out
with
a
hymn
to
the
blessed
virgin
or
elmo
keeping
time
with
their
oars
as
they
sung
i
have
indeed
remarked
all
over
this
country
that
a
man
who
transgresses
the
institutions
of
the
church
in
these
small
matters
is
much
more
infamous
than
one
who
has
committed
the
most
flagrant
crimes
against
nature
and
morality
a
murderer
adulterer
or
s
m
te
will
obtain
easy
absolution
from
the
church
and
even
find
favour
with
society
but
a
man
who
eats
a
pidgeon
on
a
saturday
without
express
licence
is
avoided
and
abhorred
as
a
monster
of
reprobation
i
have
conversed
with
several
intelligent
persons
on
the
subject
and
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
delinquent
of
this
sort
is
considered
as
a
catholic
little
better
than
a
heretic
and
of
all
crimes
they
look
upon
heresy
as
the
most
damnable
noli
is
a
small
republic
of
fishermen
subject
to
genoa
but
very
tenacious
of
their
privileges
the
town
stands
on
the
beach
tolerably
well
built
defended
by
a
castle
situated
on
a
rock
above
it
and
the
harbour
is
of
little
consequence
the
auberge
was
such
as
made
us
regret
even
the
inn
we
had
left
at
remo
after
a
very
odd
kind
of
supper
which
i
can
not
pretend
to
describe
we
retired
to
our
repose
but
i
had
not
been
in
bed
five
minutes
when
i
felt
something
crawling
on
different
parts
of
my
body
and
taking
a
light
to
examine
perceived
above
a
dozen
large
bugs
you
must
know
i
have
the
same
kind
of
antipathy
to
these
vermin
that
some
persons
have
to
a
cat
or
breast
of
veal
i
started
up
immediately
and
wrapping
myself
in
a
great
coat
sick
as
i
was
laid
down
in
the
outer
room
upon
a
chest
where
i
continued
till
morning
one
would
imagine
that
in
a
mountainous
country
like
this
there
should
be
plenty
of
goats
and
indeed
we
saw
many
flocks
of
them
feeding
among
the
rocks
yet
we
could
not
procure
half
a
pint
of
milk
for
our
tea
if
we
had
given
the
weight
of
it
in
gold
the
people
here
have
no
idea
of
using
milk
and
when
you
ask
them
for
it
they
stand
gaping
with
a
foolish
face
of
surprise
which
is
exceedingly
provoking
it
is
amazing
that
instinct
does
not
teach
the
peasants
to
feed
their
children
with
goat
milk
so
much
more
nourishing
and
agreeable
than
the
wretched
sustenance
on
which
they
live
next
day
we
rowed
by
vado
and
savona
which
last
is
a
large
town
with
a
strong
citadel
and
a
harbour
which
was
formerly
capable
of
receiving
large
ships
but
it
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
jealousy
of
the
genoese
who
have
partly
choaked
it
up
on
pretence
that
it
should
not
afford
shelter
to
the
ships
of
war
belonging
to
those
states
which
might
be
at
enmity
with
the
republic
then
we
passed
albifola
sestri
di
ponente
novi
voltri
and
a
great
number
of
villages
villas
and
magnificent
palaces
belonging
to
the
genoese
nobility
which
form
almost
a
continued
chain
of
buildings
along
the
strand
for
thirty
miles
about
five
in
the
afternoon
we
skirted
the
fine
suburbs
of
pietro
d
arena
and
arrived
at
genoa
which
makes
a
dazzling
appearance
when
viewed
from
the
sea
rising
like
an
amphitheatre
in
a
circular
form
from
the
water
edge
a
considerable
way
up
the
mountains
and
surrounded
on
the
land
side
by
a
double
wall
the
most
exterior
of
which
is
said
to
extend
fifteen
miles
in
circuit
the
first
object
that
strikes
your
eye
at
a
distance
is
a
very
elegant
pharos
or
lighthouse
built
on
the
projection
of
a
rock
on
the
west
side
of
the
harbour
so
very
high
that
in
a
clear
day
you
may
see
it
at
the
distance
of
thirty
miles
turning
the
point
you
find
yourself
close
to
the
mole
which
forms
the
harbour
of
genoa
it
is
built
at
a
great
expence
from
each
side
of
the
bay
so
as
to
form
in
the
sea
two
long
magnificent
jettes
at
the
extremity
of
each
is
another
smaller
lanthorn
these
moles
are
both
provided
with
and
between
them
is
the
entrance
into
the
harbour
but
this
is
still
so
wide
as
to
admit
a
great
sea
which
when
the
wind
blows
hard
from
south
and
is
very
troublesome
to
the
shipping
within
the
mole
there
is
a
smaller
harbour
or
wet
dock
called
darsena
for
the
gallies
of
the
republic
we
passed
through
a
considerable
number
of
ships
and
vessels
lying
at
anchor
and
landing
at
the
repaired
to
an
inn
called
la
croix
de
malthe
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
harbour
here
we
met
with
such
good
entertainment
as
prepossessed
us
in
favour
of
the
interior
parts
of
italy
and
contributed
with
other
motives
to
detain
us
some
days
in
this
city
but
i
have
detained
you
so
long
that
i
believe
you
wish
i
may
proceed
no
farther
and
therefore
i
take
my
leave
for
the
present
being
very
sincerely
yours
letter
xxvi
nice
january
dear
sir
it
is
not
without
reason
that
genoa
is
called
la
superba
the
city
itself
is
very
stately
and
the
nobles
are
very
proud
some
few
of
them
may
be
proud
of
their
wealth
but
in
general
their
fortunes
are
very
small
my
friend
r
assured
me
that
many
genoese
noblemen
had
fortunes
of
half
a
million
of
livres
per
annum
but
the
truth
is
the
whole
revenue
of
the
state
does
not
exceed
this
sum
and
the
livre
of
genoa
is
but
about
nine
pence
sterling
there
are
about
half
a
dozen
of
their
nobles
who
have
ten
thousand
a
year
but
the
majority
have
not
above
a
twentieth
part
of
that
sum
they
live
with
great
parsimony
in
their
families
and
wear
nothing
but
black
in
public
so
that
their
expences
are
but
small
if
a
genoese
nobleman
gives
an
entertainment
once
a
quarter
he
is
said
to
live
upon
the
fragments
all
the
rest
of
the
year
i
was
told
that
one
of
them
lately
treated
his
friends
and
left
the
entertainment
to
the
care
of
his
son
who
ordered
a
dish
of
fish
that
cost
a
zechine
which
is
equal
to
about
ten
shillings
sterling
the
old
gentleman
no
sooner
saw
it
appear
on
the
table
than
unable
to
suppress
his
concern
he
burst
into
tears
and
exclaimed
ah
figliuolo
indegno
siamo
in
rovina
siamo
in
precipizio
ah
prodigal
ruined
undone
i
think
the
pride
or
ostentation
of
the
italians
in
general
takes
a
more
laudable
turn
than
that
of
other
nations
a
frenchman
lays
out
his
whole
revenue
upon
tawdry
suits
of
cloaths
or
in
furnishing
a
magnificent
repas
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
dishes
one
half
of
which
are
not
eatable
nor
intended
to
be
eaten
his
wardrobe
goes
to
the
fripier
his
dishes
to
the
dogs
and
himself
to
the
devil
and
after
his
decease
no
vestige
of
him
remains
a
genoese
on
the
other
hand
keeps
himself
and
his
family
at
short
allowance
that
he
may
save
money
to
build
palaces
and
churches
which
remain
to
so
many
monuments
of
his
taste
piety
and
munificence
and
in
the
mean
time
give
employment
and
bread
to
the
poor
and
industrious
there
are
some
genoese
nobles
who
have
each
five
or
six
elegant
palaces
magnificently
furnished
either
in
the
city
or
in
different
parts
of
the
riviera
the
two
streets
called
strada
balbi
and
strada
nuova
are
continued
double
ranges
of
palaces
adorned
with
gardens
and
fountains
but
their
being
painted
on
the
outside
has
in
my
opinion
a
poor
effect
the
commerce
of
this
city
is
at
present
not
very
considerable
yet
it
has
the
face
of
business
the
streets
are
crowded
with
people
the
shops
are
well
furnished
and
the
markets
abound
with
all
sorts
of
excellent
provision
the
wine
made
in
this
neighbourhood
is
however
very
indifferent
and
all
that
is
consumed
must
be
bought
at
the
public
cantine
where
it
is
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
their
bread
is
the
whitest
and
the
best
i
have
tasted
any
where
and
the
beef
which
they
have
from
piedmont
is
juicy
and
delicious
the
expence
of
eating
in
italy
is
nearly
the
same
as
in
france
about
three
shillings
a
head
for
every
meal
the
state
of
genoa
is
very
poor
and
their
bank
of
george
has
received
such
rude
shocks
first
from
the
revolt
of
the
corsicans
and
afterwards
from
the
misfortunes
of
the
city
when
it
was
taken
by
the
austrians
in
the
war
of
that
it
still
continues
to
languish
without
any
near
prospect
of
its
credit
being
restored
nothing
shews
the
weakness
of
their
state
more
than
their
having
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
france
to
put
a
stop
to
the
progress
of
paoli
in
corsica
for
after
all
that
has
been
said
of
the
gallantry
and
courage
of
paoli
and
his
islanders
i
am
very
credibly
informed
that
they
might
be
very
easily
suppressed
if
the
genoese
had
either
vigour
in
the
council
or
resolution
in
the
field
true
it
is
they
made
a
noble
effort
in
expelling
the
austrians
who
had
taken
possession
of
their
city
but
this
effort
was
the
effect
of
oppression
and
despair
and
if
i
may
believe
the
insinuations
of
some
politicians
in
this
part
of
the
world
the
genoese
would
not
have
succeeded
in
that
attempt
if
they
had
not
previously
purchased
with
a
large
sum
of
money
the
connivance
of
the
only
person
who
could
defeat
the
enterprize
for
my
own
part
i
can
scarce
entertain
thoughts
so
prejudicial
to
the
character
of
human
nature
as
to
suppose
a
man
capable
of
sacrificing
to
such
a
consideration
the
duty
he
owed
his
prince
as
well
as
all
regard
to
the
lives
of
his
soldiers
even
those
who
lay
sick
in
hospitals
and
who
being
dragged
forth
were
miserably
butchered
by
the
furious
populace
there
is
one
more
presumption
of
his
innocence
he
still
retains
the
favour
of
his
sovereign
who
could
not
well
be
supposed
to
share
in
the
booty
there
are
mysteries
in
politics
which
were
never
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy
horatio
the
possession
of
genoa
might
have
proved
a
troublesome
bone
of
contention
which
it
might
be
convenient
to
lose
by
accident
certain
it
is
when
the
austrians
returned
after
their
expulsion
in
order
to
retake
the
city
the
engineer
being
questioned
by
the
general
declared
he
would
take
the
place
in
fifteen
days
on
pain
of
losing
his
head
and
in
four
days
after
this
declaration
the
austrians
retired
this
anecdote
i
learned
from
a
worthy
gentleman
of
this
country
who
had
it
from
the
engineer
own
mouth
perhaps
it
was
the
will
of
heaven
you
see
how
favourably
providence
has
interposed
in
behalf
of
the
reigning
empress
of
russia
first
in
removing
her
husband
secondly
in
ordaining
the
assassination
of
prince
ivan
for
which
the
perpetrators
have
been
so
liberally
rewarded
it
even
seems
determined
to
shorten
the
life
of
her
own
son
the
only
surviving
rival
from
whom
she
had
any
thing
to
fear
the
genoese
have
now
thrown
themselves
into
the
arms
of
france
for
protection
i
know
not
whether
it
would
not
have
been
a
greater
mark
of
sagacity
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
england
with
which
they
carry
on
an
advantageous
commerce
while
the
english
are
masters
of
the
mediterranean
they
will
always
have
it
in
their
power
to
do
incredible
damage
all
along
the
riviera
to
ruin
the
genoese
trade
by
sea
and
even
to
annoy
the
capital
for
notwithstanding
all
the
pains
they
have
taken
to
fortify
the
mole
and
the
city
i
am
greatly
deceived
if
it
is
not
still
exposed
to
the
danger
not
only
of
a
bombardment
but
even
of
a
cannonade
i
am
even
sanguine
enough
to
think
a
resolute
commander
might
with
a
strong
squadron
sail
directly
into
the
harbour
without
sustaining
much
damage
notwithstanding
all
the
cannon
of
the
place
which
are
said
to
amount
to
near
five
hundred
i
have
seen
a
cannonade
of
above
four
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
besides
bombs
and
cohorns
maintained
for
many
hours
without
doing
much
mischief
during
the
last
siege
of
genoa
the
french
auxiliaries
were
obliged
to
wait
at
monaco
until
a
gale
of
wind
had
driven
the
english
squadron
off
the
coast
and
then
they
went
along
shore
in
small
vessels
at
the
imminent
risque
of
being
taken
by
the
british
cruisers
by
land
i
apprehend
their
march
would
be
altogether
impracticable
if
the
king
of
sardinia
had
any
interest
to
oppose
it
he
might
either
guard
the
passes
or
break
up
the
road
in
twenty
different
places
so
as
to
render
it
altogether
impassable
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
that
when
don
philip
advanced
from
nice
with
his
army
to
genoa
he
was
obliged
to
march
so
close
to
the
shore
that
in
above
fifty
different
places
the
english
ships
might
have
rendered
the
road
altogether
impassable
the
path
which
runs
generally
along
the
face
of
a
precipice
washed
by
the
sea
is
so
narrow
that
two
men
on
horseback
can
hardly
pass
each
other
and
the
road
itself
so
rugged
slippery
and
dangerous
that
the
troopers
were
obliged
to
dismount
and
lead
their
horses
one
by
one
on
the
other
hand
baron
de
leutrum
who
was
at
the
head
of
a
large
body
of
piedmontese
troops
had
it
in
his
power
to
block
up
the
passes
of
the
mountains
and
even
to
destroy
this
road
in
such
a
manner
that
the
enemy
could
not
possibly
advance
why
these
precautions
were
not
taken
i
do
not
pretend
to
explain
neither
can
i
tell
you
wherefore
the
prince
of
monaco
who
is
a
subject
and
partizan
of
france
was
indulged
with
a
neutrality
for
his
town
which
served
as
a
a
safe
port
and
an
intermediate
post
for
the
french
succours
sent
from
marseilles
to
genoa
this
i
will
only
venture
to
affirm
that
the
success
and
advantage
of
great
alliances
are
often
sacrificed
to
low
partial
selfish
and
sordid
considerations
the
town
of
monaco
is
commanded
by
every
heighth
in
its
neighbourhood
and
might
be
laid
in
ashes
by
a
in
four
hours
by
sea
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
recommended
to
a
lady
in
genoa
who
treated
us
with
great
politeness
and
hospitality
she
introduced
me
to
an
abbate
a
man
of
letters
whose
conversation
was
extremely
agreeable
he
already
knew
me
by
reputation
and
offered
to
make
me
known
to
some
of
the
first
persons
in
the
republic
with
whom
he
lived
in
intimacy
the
lady
is
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
persons
i
have
known
in
any
country
we
assisted
at
her
conversazione
which
was
numerous
she
pressed
us
to
pass
the
winter
at
genoa
and
indeed
i
was
almost
persuaded
but
i
had
attachments
at
nice
from
which
i
could
not
easily
disengage
myself
the
few
days
we
staved
at
genoa
were
employed
in
visiting
the
most
remarkable
churches
and
palaces
in
some
of
the
churches
particularly
that
of
the
annunciata
i
found
a
profusion
of
ornaments
which
had
more
magnificence
than
taste
there
is
a
great
number
of
pictures
but
very
few
of
them
are
capital
pieces
i
had
heard
much
of
the
ponte
carignano
which
did
not
at
all
answer
my
expectation
it
is
a
bridge
that
unites
two
eminences
which
form
the
higher
part
of
the
city
and
the
houses
in
the
bottom
below
do
not
rise
so
high
as
the
springing
of
its
arches
there
is
nothing
at
all
curious
in
its
construction
nor
any
way
remarkable
except
the
heighth
of
the
piers
from
which
the
arches
are
sprung
hard
by
the
bridge
there
is
an
elegant
church
from
the
top
of
which
you
have
a
very
rich
and
extensive
prospect
of
the
city
the
sea
and
the
adjacent
country
which
looks
like
a
continent
of
groves
and
villas
the
only
remarkable
circumstance
about
the
cathedral
which
is
gothic
and
gloomy
is
the
chapel
where
the
pretended
bones
of
john
the
baptist
are
deposited
and
in
which
thirty
silver
lamps
are
continually
burning
i
had
a
curiosity
to
see
the
palaces
of
durazzo
and
doria
but
it
required
more
trouble
to
procure
admission
than
i
was
willing
to
give
myself
as
for
the
arsenal
and
the
rostrum
of
an
ancient
galley
which
was
found
by
accident
in
dragging
the
harbour
i
postponed
seeing
them
till
my
return
having
here
provided
myself
with
letters
of
credit
for
florence
and
rome
i
hired
the
same
boat
which
had
brought
us
hither
to
carry
us
forward
to
lerici
which
is
a
small
town
about
half
way
between
genoa
and
leghorn
where
travellers
who
are
tired
of
the
sea
take
to
continue
their
route
by
land
to
pisa
and
florence
i
payed
three
for
this
voyage
of
about
fifty
miles
though
i
might
have
had
a
feluca
for
less
money
when
you
land
on
the
wharf
at
genoa
you
are
plied
by
the
feluca
men
just
as
you
are
plied
by
the
watermen
at
in
london
they
are
always
ready
to
set
off
at
a
minute
warning
for
lerici
leghorn
nice
antibes
marseilles
and
every
part
of
the
riviera
the
wind
being
still
unfavourable
though
the
weather
was
delightful
we
rowed
along
shore
passing
by
several
pretty
towns
villages
and
a
vast
number
of
cassines
or
little
white
houses
scattered
among
woods
of
that
cover
the
hills
and
these
are
the
habitations
of
the
velvet
and
damask
weavers
turning
capo
fino
we
entered
a
bay
where
stand
the
towns
of
porto
fino
lavagna
and
sestri
di
levante
at
which
last
we
took
up
our
night
lodging
the
house
was
tolerable
and
we
had
no
great
reason
to
complain
of
the
beds
but
the
weather
being
hot
there
was
a
very
offensive
smell
which
proceeded
from
some
skins
of
beasts
new
killed
that
were
spread
to
dry
on
an
outhouse
in
the
yard
our
landlord
was
a
butcher
and
had
very
much
the
looks
of
an
assassin
his
wife
was
a
great
masculine
virago
who
had
all
the
air
of
having
frequented
the
instead
of
being
welcomed
with
looks
of
complaisance
we
were
admitted
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
condescension
which
seemed
to
say
we
do
much
like
your
company
but
however
you
shall
have
a
night
lodging
in
favour
of
the
patron
of
the
gondola
who
is
our
acquaintance
in
short
we
had
a
very
bad
supper
miserably
dressed
passed
a
very
disagreeable
night
and
payed
a
very
extravagant
bill
in
the
morning
without
being
thanked
for
our
custom
i
was
very
glad
to
get
out
of
the
house
with
my
throat
uncut
sestri
di
levante
is
a
little
town
pleasantly
situated
on
the
seaside
but
has
not
the
conveniency
of
a
harbour
the
fish
taken
here
is
mostly
carried
to
genoa
this
is
likewise
the
market
for
their
oil
and
the
paste
called
macaroni
of
which
they
make
a
good
quantity
next
day
we
skirted
a
very
barren
coast
consisting
of
almost
perpendicular
rocks
on
the
faces
of
which
however
we
saw
many
peasants
houses
and
hanging
terraces
for
vines
made
by
dint
of
incredible
labour
in
the
afternoon
we
entered
by
the
porti
di
venere
into
the
bay
or
gulf
of
spetia
or
spezza
which
was
the
portus
lunae
of
the
ancients
this
bay
at
the
mouth
of
which
lies
the
island
palmaria
forms
a
most
noble
and
secure
harbour
capacious
enough
to
contain
all
the
navies
in
christendom
the
entrance
on
one
side
is
defended
by
a
small
fort
built
above
the
town
of
porto
venere
which
is
a
very
poor
place
farther
in
there
is
a
battery
of
about
twenty
guns
and
on
the
right
hand
opposite
to
porto
venere
is
a
founded
on
a
rock
in
the
sea
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
is
the
town
of
spetia
on
the
left
and
on
the
right
that
of
lerici
defended
by
a
castle
of
very
little
strength
or
consequence
the
whole
bay
is
surrounded
with
plantations
of
olives
and
oranges
and
makes
a
very
delightful
appearance
in
case
of
a
war
this
would
be
an
admirable
station
for
a
british
squadron
as
it
lies
so
near
genoa
and
leghorn
and
has
a
double
entrance
by
means
of
which
the
cruisers
could
sail
in
and
out
continually
which
way
soever
the
wind
might
chance
to
sit
i
am
sure
the
fortifications
would
give
very
little
disturbance
at
the
in
lerici
the
accommodation
is
intolerable
we
were
almost
poisoned
at
supper
i
found
the
place
where
i
was
to
lie
so
close
and
confined
that
i
could
not
breathe
in
it
and
therefore
lay
all
night
in
an
outward
room
upon
four
chairs
with
a
leather
portmanteau
for
my
pillow
for
this
entertainment
i
payed
very
near
a
such
bad
accommodation
is
the
less
excusable
as
the
fellow
has
a
great
deal
of
business
this
being
a
great
thoroughfare
for
travellers
going
into
italy
or
returning
from
thence
i
might
have
saved
some
money
by
prosecuting
my
voyage
directly
by
sea
to
leghorn
but
by
this
time
we
were
all
heartily
tired
of
the
water
the
business
then
was
to
travel
by
land
to
florence
by
the
way
of
pisa
which
is
seven
posts
distant
from
lerici
those
who
have
not
their
own
carriage
must
either
hire
chaises
to
perform
the
whole
journey
or
travel
by
way
of
cambiatura
which
is
that
of
changing
the
chaises
every
post
as
the
custom
is
in
england
in
this
case
the
great
inconvenience
arises
from
your
being
obliged
to
shift
your
baggage
every
post
the
chaise
or
calesse
of
this
country
is
a
wretched
machine
with
two
wheels
as
uneasy
as
a
common
cart
being
indeed
no
other
than
what
we
should
call
in
england
a
very
chair
narrow
naked
shattered
and
shabby
for
this
vehicle
and
two
horses
you
pay
at
the
rate
of
eight
paoli
a
stage
or
four
shillings
sterling
and
the
postilion
expects
two
paoli
for
his
gratification
so
that
every
eight
miles
cost
about
five
shillings
and
four
only
if
you
travel
in
your
own
carriage
as
in
that
case
you
pay
no
more
than
at
the
rate
of
three
paoli
a
horse
about
three
miles
from
lerici
we
crossed
the
magra
which
appeared
as
a
rivulet
almost
dry
and
in
half
a
mile
farther
arrived
at
sarzana
a
small
town
at
the
extremity
of
the
genoese
territories
where
we
changed
horses
then
entering
the
principalities
of
massa
and
carrara
belonging
to
the
duke
of
modena
we
passed
lavenza
which
seems
to
be
a
decayed
fort
with
a
small
garrison
and
dined
at
massa
which
is
an
agreeable
little
town
where
the
old
dutchess
of
modena
resides
notwithstanding
all
the
expedition
we
could
make
it
was
dark
before
we
passed
the
cerchio
which
is
an
inconsiderable
stream
in
the
neighbourhood
of
pisa
where
we
arrived
about
eight
in
the
evening
the
country
from
sarzana
to
the
frontiers
of
tuscany
is
a
narrow
plain
bounded
on
the
right
by
the
sea
and
on
the
left
by
the
apennine
mountains
it
is
well
cultivated
and
inclosed
consisting
of
corn
fields
plantations
of
olives
and
the
trees
that
form
the
serve
as
so
many
props
to
the
vines
which
are
twisted
round
them
and
continued
from
one
to
another
after
entering
the
dominions
of
tuscany
we
travelled
through
a
noble
forest
of
of
a
considerable
extent
which
would
have
appeared
much
more
agreeable
had
we
not
been
benighted
and
apprehensive
of
robbers
the
last
post
but
one
in
this
days
journey
is
at
the
little
town
of
viareggio
a
kind
of
on
the

belonging
to
lucia
the
roads
are
indifferent
and
the
accommodation
is
execrable
i
was
glad
to
find
myself
housed
in
a
very
good
inn
at
pisa
where
i
promised
myself
a
good
night
rest
and
was
not
disappointed
i
heartily
wish
you
the
same
pleasure
and
am
very
sincerely

letter
xxvii
nice
january
dear
sir
pisa
is
a
fine
old
city
that
strikes
you
with
the
same
veneration
you
would
feel
at
sight
of
an
antient
temple
which
bears
the
marks
of
decay
without
being
absolutely
dilapidated
the
houses
are
well
built
the
streets
open
straight
and
well
paved
the
shops
well
furnished
and
the
markets
well
supplied
there
are
some
elegant
palaces
designed
by
great
masters
the
churches
are
built
with
taste
and
tolerably
ornamented
there
is
a
beautiful
wharf
of
freestone
on
each
side
of
the
river
arno
which
runs
through
the
city
and
three
bridges
thrown
over
it
of
which
that
in
the
middle
is
of
marble
a
pretty
piece
of
architecture
but
the
number
of
inhabitants
is
very
inconsiderable
and
this
very
circumstance
gives
it
an
air
of
majestic
solitude
which
is
far
from
being
unpleasant
to
a
man
of
a
contemplative
turn
of
mind
for
my
part
i
can
not
bear
the
tumult
of
a
populous
commercial
city
and
the
solitude
that
reigns
in
pisa
would
with
me
be
a
strong
motive
to
choose
it
as
a
place
of
residence
not
that
this
would
be
the
only
inducement
for
living
at
pisa
here
is
some
good
company
and
even
a
few
men
of
taste
and
learning
the
people
in
general
are
counted
sociable
and
polite
and
there
is
great
plenty
of
provisions
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
at
some
distance
from
the
more
frequented
parts
of
the
city
a
man
may
hire
a
large
house
for
thirty
crowns
a
year
but
near
the
center
you
can
not
have
good
lodgings
ready
furnished
for
less
than
a
scudo
about
five
shillings
a
day
the
air
in
summer
is
reckoned
unwholesome
by
the
exhalations
arising
from
stagnant
water
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
which
stands
in
the
midst
of
a
fertile
plain
low
and
marshy
yet
these
marshes
have
been
considerably
drained
and
the
air
is
much
meliorated
as
for
the
arno
it
is
no
longer
navigated
by
vessels
of
any
burthen
the
university
of
pisa
is
very
much
decayed
and
except
the
little
business
occasioned
by
the
emperor
gallies
which
are
built
in
this
town
this
is
a
mistake
no
gallies
have
been
built
here
for
a
great
many
years
and
the
dock
is
now
converted
into
stables
for
the
grand
horse
guards
i
know
of
no
commerce
it
carried
on
perhaps
the
inhabitants
live
on
the
produce
of
the
country
which
consists
of
corn
wine
and
cattle
they
are
supplied
with
excellent
water
for
drinking
by
an
aqueduct
consisting
of
above
five
thousand
arches
begun
by
cosmo
and
finished
by
ferdinand
of
tuscany
it
conveys
the
water
from
the
mountains
at
the
distance
of
five
miles
this
noble
city
formerly
the
capital
of
a
flourishing
and
powerful
republic
which
contained
above
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
within
its
walls
is
now
so
desolate
that
grass
grows
in
the
open
streets
and
the
number
of
its
people
do
not
exceed
sixteen
thousand
you
need
not
doubt
but
i
visited
the
campanile
or
which
is
a
beautiful
cylinder
of
eight
stories
each
adorned
with
a
round
of
columns
rising
one
above
another
it
stands
by
the
cathedral
and
inclines
so
far
on
one
side
from
the
perpendicular
that
in
dropping
a
plummet
from
the
top
which
is
one
hundred
and
feet
high
it
falls
sixteen
feet
from
the
base
for
my
part
i
should
never
have
dreamed
that
this
inclination
proceeded
from
any
other
cause
than
an
accidental
subsidence
of
the
foundation
on
this
side
if
some
connoisseurs
had
not
taken
great
pains
to
prove
it
was
done
on
purpose
by
the
architect
any
person
who
has
eyes
may
see
that
the
pillars
on
that
side
are
considerably
sunk
and
this
is
the
case
with
the
very
threshold
of
the
door
by
which
you
enter
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
very
preposterous
ambition
in
the
architects
to
show
how
far
they
could
deviate
from
the
perpendicular
in
this
construction
because
in
that
particular
any
common
mason
could
have
rivalled
them
all
the
world
knows
that
a
building
with
such
inclination
may
be
carried
up
till
a
line
drawn
from
the
centre
of
gravity
falls
without
the
circumference
of
the
base
and
if
they
really
intended
it
as
a
specimen
of
their
art
they
should
have
shortened
the
pilasters
on
that
side
so
as
to
exhibit
them
intire
without
the
appearance
of
sinking
these
leaning
towers
are
not
unfrequent
in
italy
there
is
one
at
bologna
another
at
venice
a
third
betwixt
venice
and
ferrara
and
a
fourth
at
ravenna
and
the
inclination
in
all
of
them
has
been
supposed
owing
to
the
foundations
giving
way
on
one
side
only
in
the
cathedral
which
is
a
large
gothic
pile
this
edifice
is
not
absolutely
gothic
it
was
built
in
the
twelfth
century
after
the
design
of
a
greek
architect
from
constantinople
where
by
that
time
the
art
was
much
degenerated
the
pillars
of
granite
are
mostly
from
the
islands
of
ebba
and
giglia
on
the
coast
of
tuscany
where
those
quarries
were
worked
by
the
antient
romans
the
giullo
and
the
verde
antico
are
very
beautiful
species
of
marble
yellow
and
green
the
first
antiently
called
marmor
numidicum
came
from
africa
the
other
was
found
according
to
strabo
on
the
mons
taygetus
in
lacedemonia
but
at
present
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
to
be
had
except
among
the
ruins
of
antiquity
there
is
a
great
number
of
massy
pillars
of
porphyry
granite
jasper
giullo
and
verde
antico
together
with
some
good
pictures
and
statues
but
the
greatest
curiosity
is
that
of
the
designed
and
executed
by
john
of
bologna
representing
embossed
in
different
compartments
the
history
of
the
old
and
new
testament
i
was
so
charmed
with
this
work
that
i
could
have
stood
a
whole
day
to
examine
and
admire
it
in
the
baptisterium
which
stands
opposite
to
this
front
there
are
some
beautiful
marbles
particularly
the
font
and
a
pulpit
supported
by
the
statues
of
different
animals
between
the
cathedral
and
this
building
about
one
hundred
paces
on
one
side
is
the
famous
called
campo
santo
from
its
being
covered
with
earth
brought
from
jerusalem
it
is
an
oblong
square
surrounded
by
a
very
high
wall
and
always
kept
shut
there
is
a
spacious
corridore
round
the
whole
space
which
is
a
noble
walk
for
a
contemplative
philosopher
it
is
paved
chiefly
with
flat
the
walls
are
painted
in
fresco
by
ghiotto
giottino
stefano
bennoti
bufalmaco
and
some
others
of
his
cotemporaries
and
disciples
who
flourished
immediately
after
the
restoration
of
painting
the
subjects
are
taken
from
the
bible
though
the
manner
is
dry
the
drawing
incorrect
the
design
generally
lame
and
the
colouring
unnatural
yet
there
is
merit
in
the
expression
and
the
whole
remains
as
a
curious
monument
of
the
efforts
made
by
this
noble
art
immediately
after
her
revival
the
history
of
job
by
giotto
is
much
admired
here
are
some
deceptions
in
perspective
equally
ingenious
and
pleasing
particularly
the
figures
of
certain
animals
which
exhibit
exactly
the
same
appearance
from
whatever
different
points
of
view
they
are
seen
one
division
of
the
consists
of
a
particular
compost
which
in
nine
days
consumes
the
dead
bodies
to
the
bones
in
all
probability
it
is
no
other
than
common
earth
mixed
with
at
one
corner
of
the
corridore
there
are
the
pictures
of
three
bodies
represented
in
the
three
different
stages
of
putrefaction
which
they
undergo
when
laid
in
this
composition
at
the
end
of
the
three
first
days
the
body
is
bloated
and
swelled
and
the
features
are
enlarged
and
distorted
to
such
a
degree
as
fills
the
spectator
with
horror
at
the
sixth
day
the
swelling
is
subsided
and
all
the
muscular
flesh
hangs
loosened
from
the
bones
at
the
ninth
nothing
but
the
skeleton
remains
there
is
a
small
neat
chapel
at
one
end
of
the
campo
santo
with
some
tombs
on
one
of
which
is
a
beautiful
bust
by
buona
roti
here
is
a
sumptuous
cenotaph
erected
by
pope
gregory
xiii
to
the
memory
of
his
brother
giovanni
buoncampagni
it
is
called
the
monumentum
gregorianum
of
a
marble
from
scravezza
in
this
neighbourhood
adorned
with
a
couple
of
columns
of
touchstone
and
two
beautiful
spherical
plates
of
alabaster
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridore
there
is
a
range
of
antient
sepulchral
stones
ornamented
with
brought
hither
from
different
parts
by
the
pisan
fleets
in
the
course
of
their
expeditions
i
was
struck
with
the
figure
of
a
woman
lying
dead
on
a
covered
with
a
piece
of
thin
drapery
so
delicately
cut
as
to
shew
all
the
flexures
of
the
attitude
and
even
all
the
swellings
and
sinuosities
of
the
muscles
instead
of
stone
it
looks
like
a
sheet
of
wet
linen
one
of
these
antiquities
representing
the
hunting
of
meleager
was
converted
into
a
coffin
for
the
countess
beatrice
mother
of
the
famous
countess
mathilda
it
is
now
fixed
to
the
outside
of
the
church
wall
just
by
one
of
the
doors
and
is
a
very
elegant
piece
of
sculpture
near
the
same
place
is
a
fine
pillar
of
porphyry
supporting
the
figure
of
a
lion
and
a
kind
of
urn
which
seems
to
be
a
sarcophagus
though
an
inscription
round
the
base
declares
it
is
a
talentum
in
which
the
antient
pisans
measured
the
census
or
tax
which
they
payed
to
augustus
but
in
what
metal
or
specie
this
census
was
payed
we
are
left
to
divine
there
are
likewise
in
the
campo
santo
two
antique
latin
edicts
of
the
pisan
senate
injoining
the
citizens
to
go
into
mourning
for
the
death
of
caius
and
lucius
caesar
the
sons
of
agrippa
and
heirs
declared
of
the
emperor
fronting
this
cemetery
on
the
other
side
of
the
piazza
of
the
dome
is
a
large
elegant
hospital
in
which
the
sick
are
conveniently
and
comfortably
lodged
entertained
and
attended
for
four
zechines
i
hired
a
and
four
from
pisa
to
florence
this
road
which
lies
along
the
arno
is
very
good
and
the
country
is
delightful
variegated
with
hill
and
vale
wood
and
water
meadows
and
planted
and
inclosed
like
the
counties
of
middlesex
and
hampshire
with
this
difference
however
that
all
the
trees
in
this
tract
were
covered
with
vines
and
the
ripe
clusters
black
and
white
hung
down
from
every
bough
in
a
most
luxuriant
and
romantic
abundance
the
vines
in
this
country
are
not
planted
in
rows
and
propped
with
sticks
as
in
france
and
the
county
of
nice
but
twine
around
the
trees
which
they
almost
quite
cover
with
their
foliage
and
fruit
the
branches
of
the
vine
are
extended
from
tree
to
tree
exhibiting
beautiful
festoons
of
real
leaves
tendrils
and
swelling
clusters
a
foot
long
by
this
oeconomy
the
ground
of
the
inclosure
is
spared
for
corn
grass
or
any
other
production
the
trees
commonly
planted
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
the
vines
are
maple
elm
and
aller
with
which
last
the
banks
of
the
arno
abound
it
would
have
been
still
more
for
the
advantage
of
the
country
and
the
prospect
if
instead
of
these
they
had
planted
fruit
trees
for
the
purpose
this
river
which
is
very
inconsiderable
with
respect
to
the
quantity
of
water
would
be
a
charming
pastoral
stream
if
it
was
transparent
but
it
is
always
muddy
and
discoloured
about
ten
or
a
dozen
miles
below
florence
there
are
some
marble
quarries
on
the
side
of
it
from
whence
the
blocks
are
conveyed
in
boats
when
there
is
water
enough
in
the
river
to
float
them
that
is
after
heavy
rains
or
the
melting
of
the
snow
upon
the
mountains
of
umbria
being
part
of
the
apennines
from
whence
it
takes
its
rise
florence
is
a
noble
city
that
still
retains
all
the
marks
of
a
majestic
capital
such
as
piazzas
palaces
fountains
bridges
statues
and
arcades
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
churches
here
are
magnificent
and
adorned
not
only
with
pillars
of
oriental
granite
porphyry
jasper
verde
antico
and
other
precious
stones
but
also
with
capital
pieces
of
painting
by
the
most
eminent
masters
several
of
these
churches
however
stand
without
fronts
for
want
of
money
to
complete
the
plans
it
may
also
appear
superfluous
to
mention
my
having
viewed
the
famous
gallery
of
antiquities
the
chapel
of
lorenzo
the
palace
of
pitti
the
cathedral
the
baptisterium
ponte
de
trinita
with
its
statues
the
triumphal
arch
and
every
thing
which
is
commonly
visited
in
this
metropolis
but
all
these
objects
having
been
circumstantially
described
by
twenty
different
authors
of
travels
i
shall
not
trouble
you
with
a
repetition
of
trite
observations
that
part
of
the
city
which
stands
on
each
side
of
the
river
makes
a
very
elegant
appearance
to
which
the
four
bridges
and
the
between
them
contribute
in
a
great
measure
i
lodged
at
the
widow
vanini
an
english
house
delightfully
situated
in
this
quarter
the
landlady
who
is
herself
a
native
of
england
we
found
very
obliging
the
are
comfortable
and
the
entertainment
is
good
and
reasonable
there
is
a
considerable
number
of
fashionable
people
at
florence
and
many
of
them
in
good
circumstances
they
affect
a
gaiety
in
their
dress
equipage
and
conversation
but
stand
very
much
on
their
punctilio
with
strangers
and
will
not
without
great
reluctance
admit
into
their
assemblies
any
lady
of
another
country
whose
noblesse
is
not
ascertained
by
a
title
this
reserve
is
in
some
measure
excusable
among
a
people
who
are
extremely
ignorant
of
foreign
customs
and
who
know
that
in
their
own
country
every
person
even
the
most
insignificant
who
has
any
pretensions
to
family
either
inherits
or
assumes
the
title
of
principe
conte
or
marchese
with
all
their
pride
however
the
nobles
of
florence
are
humble
enough
to
enter
into
partnership
with
and
even
to
sell
wine
by
retail
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
in
every
palace
or
great
house
in
this
city
there
is
a
little
window
fronting
the
street
provided
with
an
and
over
it
hangs
an
empty
flask
by
way
of
thither
you
send
your
servant
to
buy
a
bottle
of
wine
he
knocks
at
the
little
wicket
which
is
opened
immediately
by
a
domestic
who
supplies
him
with
what
he
wants
and
receives
the
money
like
the
waiter
of
any
other
cabaret
it
is
pretty
extraordinary
that
it
should
not
be
deemed
a
disparagement
in
a
nobleman
to
sell
half
a
pound
of
figs
or
a
palm
of
ribbon
or
tape
or
to
take
money
for
a
flask
of
sour
wine
and
yet
be
counted
infamous
to
match
his
daughter
in
the
family
of
a
person
who
has
distinguished
himself
in
any
one
of
the
learned
professions
though
florence
be
tolerably
populous
there
seems
to
be
very
little
trade
of
any
kind
in
it
but
the
inhabitants
flatter
themselves
with
the
prospect
of
reaping
great
advantage
from
the
residence
of
one
of
the
for
whose
reception
they
are
now
repairing
the
palace
of
pitti
i
know
not
what
the
revenues
of
tuscany
may
amount
to
since
the
succession
of
the
princes
of
lorraine
but
under
the
last
dukes
of
the
medici
family
they
were
said
to
produce
two
millions
of
crowns
equal
to
five
hundred
thousand
pounds
sterling
these
arose
from
a
very
heavy
tax
upon
land
and
houses
the
portions
of
maidens
and
suits
at
law
besides
the
duties
upon
traffick
a
severe
gabelle
upon
the
necessaries
of
life
and
a
toll
upon
every
eatable
entered
into
this
capital
if
we
may
believe
leti
the
grand
duke
was
then
able
to
raise
and
maintain
an
army
of
forty
thousand
infantry
and
three
thousand
horse
with
twelve
gallies
two
galeasses
and
twenty
ships
of
war
i
question
if
tuscany
can
maintain
at
present
above
one
half
of
such
an
armament
he
that
now
commands
the
emperor
navy
consisting
of
a
few
frigates
is
an
englishman
called
acton
who
was
heretofore
captain
of
a
ship
in
our
east
india
company
service
he
has
lately
embraced
the
catholic
religion
and
been
created
admiral
of
tuscany
there
is
a
tolerable
opera
in
florence
for
the
entertainment
of
the
best
company
though
they
do
not
seem
very
attentive
to
the
musick
italy
is
certainly
the
native
country
of
this
art
and
yet
i
do
not
find
the
people
in
general
either
more
musically
inclined
or
better
provided
with
ears
than
their
neighbours
here
is
also
a
wretched
troop
of
comedians
for
the
burgeois
and
lower
class
of
people
but
what
seems
most
to
suit
the
taste
of
all
ranks
is
the
exhibition
of
church
pageantry
i
had
occasion
to
see
a
procession
where
all
the
noblesse
of
the
city
attended
in
their
coaches
which
filled
the
whole
length
of
the
great
street
called
the
corso
it
was
the
anniversary
of
a
charitable
institution
in
favour
of
poor
maidens
a
certain
number
of
whom
are
portioned
every
year
about
two
hundred
of
these
virgins
walked
in
procession
two
and
two
together
cloathed
in
wide
gowns
with
white
veils
on
their
heads
and
made
a
very
classical
appearance
they
were
preceded
and
followed
by
an
irregular
mob
of
penitents
in
with
lighted
tapers
and
monks
carrying
crucifixes
bawling
and
bellowing
the
litanies
but
the
great
object
was
a
figure
of
the
virgin
mary
as
big
as
the
life
standing
within
a
gilt
frame
dressed
in
a
gold
stuff
with
a
large
hoop
a
great
quantity
of
false
jewels
her
face
painted
and
patched
and
her
hair
frizzled
and
curled
in
the
very
extremity
of
the
fashion
very
little
regard
had
been
paid
to
the
image
of
our
saviour
on
the
cross
but
when
his
appeared
on
the
shoulders
of
three
or
four
lusty
friars
the
whole
populace
fell
upon
their
knees
in
the
dirt
this
extraordinary
veneration
paid
to
the
virgin
must
have
been
derived
originally
from
the
french
who
pique
themselves
on
their
gallantry
to
the
fair
sex
amidst
all
the
scenery
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
i
have
never
yet
seen
any
of
the
spectators
affected
at
heart
or
discover
the
least
signs
of
fanaticism
the
very
disciplinants
who
scourge
themselves
in
the
are
generally
peasants
or
parties
hired
for
the
purpose
those
of
the
confrairies
who
have
an
ambition
to
distinguish
themselves
on
such
occasions
take
care
to
secure
their
backs
from
the
smart
by
means
of
secret
armour
either
women
boddice
or
quilted
jackets
the
confrairies
are
fraternities
of
devotees
who
inlist
themselves
under
the
banners
of
particular
saints
on
days
of
procession
they
appear
in
a
body
dressed
as
penitents
and
masked
and
distinguished
by
crosses
on
their
habits
there
is
scarce
an
individual
whether
noble
or
plebeian
who
does
not
belong
to
one
of
these
associations
which
may
be
compared
to
the
freemasons
gregoreans
and
antigallicans
of
england
just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
florence
there
is
a
triumphal
arch
erected
on
occasion
of
the
late
emperor
making
his
public
entry
when
he
succeeded
to
the
dukedom
of
tuscany
and
herein
the
summer
evenings
the
quality
resort
to
take
the
air
in
their
coaches
every
carriage
stops
and
forms
a
little
separate
conversazione
the
ladies
sit
within
and
the
cicisbei
stand
on
the
on
each
side
of
the
coach
entertaining
them
with
their
discourse
it
would
be
no
unpleasant
inquiry
to
trace
this
sort
of
gallantry
to
its
original
and
investigate
all
its
progress
the
italians
having
been
accused
of
jealousy
were
resolved
to
wipe
off
the
reproach
and
seeking
to
avoid
it
for
the
future
have
run
into
the
other
extreme
i
know
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
custom
of
choosing
cicisbei
was
calculated
to
prevent
the
extinction
of
families
which
would
otherwise
often
happen
in
consequence
of
marriages
founded
upon
interest
without
any
mutual
affection
in
the
contracting
parties
how
far
this
political
consideration
may
have
weighed
against
the
jealous
and
vindictive
temper
of
the
italians
i
will
not
pretend
to
judge
but
certain
it
is
every
married
lady
in
this
country
has
her
cicisbeo
or
servente
who
attends
her
every
where
and
on
all
occasions
and
upon
whose
privileges
the
husband
dares
not
encroach
without
incurring
the
censure
and
ridicule
of
the
whole
community
for
my
part
i
would
rather
be
condemned
for
life
to
the
gallies
than
exercise
the
office
of
a
cicisbeo
exposed
to
the
intolerable
caprices
and
dangerous
resentment
of
an
italian
virago
i
pretend
not
to
judge
of
the
national
character
from
my
own
observation
but
if
the
portraits
drawn
by
goldoni
in
his
comedies
are
taken
from
nature
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
the
italian
women
the
most
haughty
insolent
capricious
and
revengeful
females
on
the
face
of
the
earth
indeed
their
resentments
are
so
cruelly
implacable
and
contain
such
a
mixture
of
perfidy
that
in
my
opinion
they
are
very
unfit
subjects
for
comedy
whose
province
it
is
rather
to
ridicule
folly
than
to
stigmatize
such
atrocious
vice
you
have
often
heard
it
said
that
the
purity
of
the
italian
is
to
be
found
in
the
lingua
toscana
and
bocca
romana
certain
it
is
the
pronunciation
of
the
tuscans
is
disagreeably
guttural
the
letters
c
and
g
they
pronounce
with
an
aspiration
which
hurts
the
ear
of
an
englishman
and
is
i
think
rather
rougher
than
that
of
the
x
in
spanish
it
sounds
as
if
the
speaker
had
lost
his
palate
i
really
imagined
the
first
man
i
heard
speak
in
pisa
had
met
with
that
misfortune
in
the
course
of
his
amours
one
of
the
greatest
curiosities
you
meet
with
in
italy
is
the
improvisatore
such
is
the
name
given
to
certain
individuals
who
have
the
surprising
talent
of
reciting
verses
extempore
on
any
subject
you
propose
corvesi
my
landlord
has
a
son
a
franciscan
friar
who
is
a
great
genius
in
this
way
when
the
subject
is
given
his
brother
tunes
his
violin
to
accompany
him
and
he
begins
to
rehearse
in
recitative
with
wonderful
fluency
and
precision
thus
he
will
at
a
minute
warning
recite
two
or
three
hundred
verses
well
turned
and
well
adapted
and
generally
mingled
with
an
elegant
compliment
to
the
company
the
italians
are
so
fond
of
poetry
that
many
of
them
have
the
best
part
of
ariosto
tasso
and
petrarch
by
heart
and
these
are
the
great
sources
from
which
the
improvisatori
draw
their
rhimes
cadence
and
turns
of
expression
but
lest
you
should
think
there
is
neither
rhime
nor
reason
in
protracting
this
tedious
epistle
i
shall
conclude
it
with
the
old
burden
of
my
song
that
i
am
always
your
affectionate
humble
servant
letter
xxviii
nice
february
dear
sir
your
entertaining
letter
of
the
fifth
of
last
month
was
a
very
charitable
and
a
very
agreeable
donation
but
your
suspicion
is
groundless
i
assure
you
upon
my
honour
i
have
no
share
whatever
in
any
of
the
disputes
which
agitate
the
public
nor
do
i
know
any
thing
of
your
political
transactions
except
what
i
casually
see
in
one
of
your
newspapers
with
the
perusal
of
which
i
am
sometimes
favoured
by
our
consul
at
villefranche
you
insist
upon
my
being
more
particular
in
my
remarks
on
what
i
saw
at
florence
and
i
shall
obey
the
injunction
the
famous
gallery
which
contains
the
antiquities
is
the
third
story
of
a
noble
built
in
the
form
of
the
greek
pi
the
upper
part
fronting
the
river
arno
and
one
of
the
legs
adjoining
to
the
where
the
courts
of
justice
are
held
as
the
house
of
medici
had
for
some
centuries
resided
in
the
palace
of
pitti
situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
full
mile
from
these
tribunals
the
architect
vasari
who
planned
the
new
edifice
at
the
same
time
contrived
a
corridore
or
covered
passage
extending
from
the
palace
of
pitti
along
one
of
the
bridges
to
the
gallery
of
curiosities
through
which
the
passed
unseen
when
he
was
disposed
either
to
amuse
himself
with
his
antiquities
or
to
assist
at
his
courts
of
judicature
but
there
is
nothing
very
extraordinary
either
in
the
contrivance
or
execution
of
this
corridore
if
i
resided
in
florence
i
would
give
something
extraordinary
for
permission
to
walk
every
day
in
the
gallery
which
i
should
much
prefer
to
the
lycaeum
the
groves
of
academus
or
any
porch
or
philosophical
alley
in
athens
or
in
rome
here
by
viewing
the
statues
and
busts
ranged
on
each
side
i
should
become
acquainted
with
the
faces
of
all
the
remarkable
personages
male
and
female
of
antiquity
and
even
be
able
to
trace
their
different
characters
from
the
expression
of
their
features
this
collection
is
a
most
excellent
commentary
upon
the
roman
historians
particularly
suetonius
and
dion
cassius
there
was
one
circumstance
that
struck
me
in
viewing
the
busts
of
caracalla
both
here
and
in
the
capitol
at
rome
there
was
a
certain
ferocity
in
the
eyes
which
seemed
to
contradict
the
sweetness
of
the
other
features
and
remarkably
justified
the
epithet
caracuyl
by
which
he
was
distinguished
by
the
antient
inhabitants
of
in
the
language
of
the
highlanders
caracuyl
signifies
cruel
eye
as
we
are
given
to
understand
by
the
ingenious
editor
of
fingal
who
seems
to
think
that
caracalla
is
no
other
than
the
celtic
word
adapted
to
the
pronunciation
of
the
romans
but
the
truth
is
caracalla
was
the
name
of
a
gaulish
vestment
which
this
prince
affected
to
wear
and
hence
he
derived
that
surname
the
caracuyl
of
the
britons
is
the
same
as
the
upodra
idon
of
the
greeks
which
homer
has
so
often
applied
to
his
scolding
heroes
i
like
the
bacchanalian
chiefly
for
the
fine
drapery
the
wind
occasioned
by
her
motion
seems
to
have
swelled
and
raised
it
from
the
parts
of
the
body
which
it
covers
there
is
another
gay
bacchanalian
in
the
attitude
of
dancing
crowned
with
ivy
holding
in
her
right
hand
a
bunch
of
grapes
and
in
her
left
the
thyrsus
the
head
of
the
celebrated
flora
is
very
beautiful
the
groupe
of
cupid
and
psyche
however
did
not
give
me
all
the
pleasure
i
expected
from
it
of
all
the
marbles
that
appear
in
the
open
gallery
the
following
are
those
i
most
admire
leda
with
the
swan
as
for
jupiter
in
this
transformation
he
has
much
the
appearance
of
a
goose
i
have
not
seen
any
thing
tamer
but
the
sculptor
has
admirably
shewn
his
art
in
representing
leda
hand
partly
hid
among
the
feathers
which
are
so
lightly
touched
off
that
the
very
shape
of
the
fingers
are
seen
underneath
the
statue
of
a
youth
supposed
to
be
ganymede
is
compared
by
the
connoisseurs
to
the
celebrated
venus
and
as
far
as
i
can
judge
not
without
reason
it
is
however
rather
agreeable
than
striking
and
will
please
a
connoisseur
much
more
than
a
common
spectator
i
know
not
whether
it
is
my
regard
to
the
faculty
that
inhances
the
value
of
the
noted
esculapius
who
appears
with
a
venerable
beard
of
delicate
workmanship
he
is
larger
than
the
life
cloathed
in
a
magnificent
pallium
his
left
arm
resting
on
a
knotted
staff
round
which
the
snake
is
twined
according
to
ovid
hunc
modo
serpentem
baculum
qui
nexibus
ambit
perspice
behold
the
snake
his
mystic
rod
intwine
he
has
in
his
hand
the
fascia
herbarum
and
the
crepidae
on
his
feet
there
is
a
represented
lying
on
one
side
which
i
admire
as
a
the
savageness
of
his
appearance
is
finely
contrasted
with
the
case
and
indolence
of
the
attitude
were
i
to
meet
with
a
living
boar
lying
with
the
same
expression
i
should
be
tempted
to
stroke
his
bristles
here
is
an
elegant
bust
of
antinous
the
favourite
of
adrian
and
a
beautiful
head
of
alexander
the
great
turned
on
one
side
with
an
expression
of
languishment
and
anxiety
in
his
countenance
the
virtuosi
are
not
agreed
about
the
circumstance
in
which
he
is
represented
whether
fainting
with
the
loss
of
blood
which
he
suffered
in
his
adventure
at
oxydrace
or
languishing
with
the
fever
contracted
by
bathing
in
the
cydnus
or
finally
complaining
to
his
father
jove
that
there
were
no
other
worlds
for
him
to
conquer
the
kneeling
narcissus
is
a
striking
figure
and
the
expression
admirable
the
two
bacchi
are
perfectly
well
executed
but
to
my
shame
be
it
spoken
i
prefer
to
the
antique
that
which
is
the
work
of
michael
angelo
buonaroti
concerning
which
the
story
is
told
which
you
well
know
the
artist
having
been
blamed
by
some
pretended
connoisseurs
for
not
imitating
the
manner
of
the
ancients
is
said
to
have
privately
finished
this
bacchus
and
buried
it
after
having
broke
off
an
arm
which
he
kept
as
a
voucher
the
statue
being
dug
up
by
accident
was
allowed
by
the
best
judges
to
be
a
perfect
antique
upon
which
buonaroti
produced
the
arm
and
claimed
his
own
work
bianchi
looks
upon
this
as
a
fable
but
owns
that
vasari
tells
such
another
of
a
child
cut
in
marble
by
the
same
artist
which
being
carried
to
rome
and
kept
for
some
time
under
ground
was
dug
up
as
an
antique
and
sold
for
a
great
deal
of
money
i
was
likewise
attracted
by
the
morpheus
in
touchstone
which
is
described
by
addison
who
by
the
bye
notwithstanding
all
his
taste
has
been
convicted
by
bianchi
of
several
gross
blunders
in
his
account
of
this
gallery
with
respect
to
the
famous
venus
pontia
commonly
called
de
medicis
which
was
found
at
tivoli
and
is
kept
in
a
separate
apartment
called
the
tribuna
i
believe
i
ought
to
be
intirely
silent
or
at
least
conceal
my
real
sentiments
which
will
otherwise
appear
equally
absurd
and
presumptuous
it
must
be
want
of
taste
that
prevents
my
feeling
that
enthusiastic
admiration
with
which
others
are
inspired
at
sight
of
this
statue
a
statue
which
in
reputation
equals
that
of
cupid
by
praxiteles
which
brought
such
a
concourse
of
strangers
of
old
to
the
little
town
of
thespiae
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
is
no
beauty
in
the
features
of
venus
and
that
the
attitude
is
aukward
and
out
of
character
it
is
a
bad
plea
to
urge
that
the
antients
and
we
differ
in
the
ideas
of
beauty
we
know
the
contrary
from
their
medals
busts
and
historians
without
all
doubt
the
limbs
and
proportions
of
this
statue
are
elegantly
formed
and
accurately
designed
according
to
the
nicest
rules
of
symmetry
and
proportion
and
the
back
parts
especially
are
executed
so
happily
as
to
excite
the
admiration
of
the
most
indifferent
spectator
one
can
not
help
thinking
it
is
the
very
venus
of
cnidos
by
praxiteles
which
lucian
describes
hercle
quanta
dorsi
concinnitas
ut
exuberantes
lumbi
amplexantes
manus
implent
quam
scite
circumductae
clunium
pulpae
in
se
rotundantur
neque
tenues
nimis
ipsis
ossibus
adstrictae
neque
in
immensam
effusae
pinguedinem
that
the
statue
thus
described
was
not
the
venus
de
medicis
would
appear
from
the
greek
inscription
on
the
base
kleomenis
appollodoroi
athinaios
epoesei
cleomenes
filius
apollodori
fecit
did
we
not
know
that
this
inscription
is
counted
spurious
and
that
instead
of
epoesei
it
should
be
epoiese
this
however
is
but
a
frivolous
objection
as
we
have
seen
many
inscriptions
undoubtedly
antique
in
which
the
orthography
is
false
either
from
the
ignorance
or
carelessness
of
the
sculptor
others
suppose
not
without
reason
that
this
statue
is
a
representation
of
the
famous
phryne
the
courtesan
of
athens
who
at
the
celebration
of
the
eleusinian
games
exhibited
herself
coming
out
of
the
bath
naked
to
the
eyes
of
the
whole
athenian
people
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
dancing
faun
and
still
better
with
the
lotti
or
wrestlers
the
attitudes
of
which
are
beautifully
contrived
to
shew
the
different
turns
of
the
limbs
and
the
swelling
of
the
muscles
but
what
pleased
me
best
of
all
the
statues
in
the
tribuna
was
the
arrotino
commonly
called
the
whetter
and
generally
supposed
to
represent
a
slave
who
in
the
act
of
whetting
a
knife
overhears
the
conspiracy
of
catiline
you
know
he
is
represented
on
one
knee
and
certain
it
is
i
never
saw
such
an
expression
of
anxious
attention
as
appears
in
his
countenance
but
it
is
not
mingled
with
any
marks
of
surprise
such
as
could
not
fail
to
lay
hold
on
a
man
who
overhears
by
accident
a
conspiracy
against
the
state
the
marquis
de
maffei
has
justly
observed
that
sallust
in
his
very
circumstantial
detail
of
that
conspiracy
makes
no
mention
of
any
such
discovery
neither
does
it
appear
that
the
figure
is
in
the
act
of
whetting
the
stone
which
he
holds
in
one
hand
being
rough
and
unequal
no
ways
resembling
a
whetstone
others
alledge
it
represents
milico
the
freedman
of
scaevinus
who
conspired
against
the
life
of
nero
and
gave
his
poignard
to
be
whetted
to
milico
who
presented
it
to
the
emperor
with
an
account
of
the
conspiracy
but
the
attitude
and
expression
will
by
no
means
admit
of
this
interpretation
bianchi
this
antiquarian
is
now
imprisoned
for
life
for
having
robbed
the
gallery
and
then
set
it
on
fire
who
shows
the
gallery
thinks
the
statue
represents
the
augur
attius
navius
who
cut
a
stone
with
a
knife
at
the
command
of
tarquinius
priscus
this
conjecture
seems
to
be
confirmed
by
a
medallion
of
antoninus
pius
inserted
by
vaillant
among
his
numismata
prestantiora
on
which
is
delineated
nearly
such
a
figure
as
this
in
question
with
the
following
legend
attius
navius
genuflexus
ante
tarquinium
priscum
cotem
cultro
discidit
he
owns
indeed
that
in
the
statue
the
augur
is
not
distinguished
either
by
his
habit
or
emblems
and
he
might
have
added
neither
is
the
stone
a
cotes
for
my
own
part
i
think
neither
of
these
three
opinions
is
satisfactory
though
the
last
is
very
ingenious
perhaps
the
figure
allude
to
a
private
incident
which
never
was
recorded
in
any
history
among
the
great
number
of
pictures
in
this
tribuna
i
was
most
charmed
with
the
venus
by
titian
which
has
a
sweetness
of
expression
and
tenderness
of
colouring
not
to
be
described
in
this
apartment
they
reckon
three
hundred
pieces
the
greatest
part
by
the
best
masters
particularly
by
raphael
in
the
three
manners
by
which
he
distinguished
himself
at
different
periods
of
his
life
as
for
the
celebrated
statue
of
the
hermaphrodite
which
we
find
in
another
room
i
give
the
sculptor
credit
for
his
ingenuity
in
mingling
the
sexes
in
the
composition
but
it
is
at
best
no
other
than
a
monster
in
nature
which
i
never
had
any
pleasure
in
viewing
nor
indeed
do
i
think
there
was
much
talent
required
in
representing
a
figure
with
the
head
and
breasts
of
a
woman
and
all
the
other
parts
of
the
body
masculine
there
is
such
a
profusion
of
curiosities
in
this
celebrated
musaeum
statues
busts
pictures
medals
tables
inlaid
in
the
way
of
marquetry
cabinets
adorned
with
precious
stones
jewels
of
all
sorts
mathematical
instruments
antient
arms
and
military
machines
that
the
imagination
is
bewildered
and
a
stranger
of
a
visionary
turn
would
be
apt
to
fancy
himself
in
a
palace
of
the
fairies
raised
and
adorned
by
the
power
of
inchantment
in
one
of
the
detached
apartments
i
saw
the
antependium
of
the
altar
designed
for
the
famous
chapel
of
lorenzo
it
is
a
curious
piece
of
architecture
inlaid
with
coloured
marble
and
precious
stones
so
as
to
represent
an
infinite
variety
of
natural
objects
it
is
adorned
with
some
crystal
pillars
with
capitals
of
beaten
gold
the
second
story
of
the
building
is
occupied
by
a
great
number
of
artists
employed
in
this
very
curious
work
of
marquetry
representing
figures
with
gems
and
different
kinds
of
coloured
marble
for
the
use
of
the
emperor
the
italians
call
it
pietre
commesse
a
sort
of
inlaying
with
stones
analogous
to
the
fineering
of
cabinets
in
wood
it
is
peculiar
to
florence
and
seems
to
be
still
more
curious
than
the
mosaic
work
which
the
romans
have
brought
to
great
perfection
the
cathedral
of
florence
is
a
great
gothic
building
encrusted
on
the
outside
with
marble
it
is
remarkable
for
nothing
but
its
cupola
which
is
said
to
have
been
copied
by
the
architect
of
peter
at
rome
and
for
its
size
which
is
much
greater
than
that
of
any
other
church
in
christendom
in
this
cathedral
is
the
tomb
of
johannes
acutus
anglus
which
a
man
would
naturally
interpret
as
john
sharp
but
his
name
was
really
hawkwood
which
the
italians
have
corrupted
into
acut
he
was
a
celebrated
general
or
condottiere
who
arrived
in
italy
at
the
head
of
four
thousand
soldiers
of
fortune
mostly
englishmen
who
had
served
with
him
in
the
army
of
king
edward
and
were
dismissed
at
the
peace
of
bontigny
hawkwood
greatly
distinguished
himself
in
italy
by
his
valour
and
conduct
and
died
a
very
old
man
in
the
florentine
service
he
was
the
son
of
a
tanner
in
essex
and
had
been
put
apprentice
to
a
taylor
the
baptistery
which
stands
by
it
was
an
antient
temple
said
to
be
dedicated
to
mars
there
are
some
good
statues
of
marble
within
and
one
or
two
of
bronze
on
the
outside
of
the
doors
but
it
is
chiefly
celebrated
for
the
embossed
work
of
its
brass
gates
by
lorenzo
ghiberti
which
buonaroti
used
to
say
deserved
to
be
made
the
gates
of
paradise
i
viewed
them
with
pleasure
but
still
i
retained
a
greater
veneration
for
those
of
pisa
which
i
had
first
admired
a
preference
which
either
arises
from
want
of
taste
or
from
the
charm
of
novelty
by
which
the
former
were
recommended
to
my
attention
those
who
would
have
a
particular
detail
of
every
thing
worth
seeing
at
florence
comprehending
churches
libraries
palaces
tombs
statues
pictures
fountains
bridge
etc
may
consult
keysler
who
is
so
laboriously
circumstantial
in
his
descriptions
that
i
never
could
peruse
them
without
suffering
the
headache
and
recollecting
the
old
observation
that
the
german
genius
lies
more
in
the
back
than
in
the
brain
i
was
much
disappointed
in
the
chapel
of
lorenzo
notwithstanding
the
great
profusion
of
granite
porphyry
jasper
verde
antico
and
other
precious
stones
representing
figures
in
the
way
of
marquetry
i
think
the
whole
has
a
gloomy
effect
these
pietre
commesse
are
better
calculated
for
cabinets
than
for
ornaments
to
great
buildings
which
ought
to
be
large
masses
proportioned
to
the
greatness
of
the
edifice
the
compartments
are
so
small
that
they
produce
no
effect
in
giving
the
first
impression
when
one
enters
the
place
except
to
give
an
air
of
littleness
to
the
whole
just
as
if
a
grand
saloon
was
covered
with
pictures
painted
in
miniature
if
they
have
as
little
regard
to
proportion
and
perspective
when
they
paint
the
dome
which
is
not
yet
finished
this
chapel
will
in
my
opinion
remain
a
monument
of
ill
taste
and
extravagance
the
court
of
the
palace
of
pitti
is
formed
by
three
sides
of
an
elegant
square
with
arcades
all
round
like
the
palace
of
holyrood
house
at
edinburgh
and
the
rustic
work
which
constitutes
the
lower
part
of
the
building
gives
it
an
air
of
strength
and
magnificence
in
this
court
there
is
a
fine
fountain
in
which
the
water
trickles
down
from
above
and
here
is
also
an
admirable
antique
statue
of
hercules
inscribed
lusippoi
ergon
the
work
of
lysippus
the
apartments
of
this
palace
are
generally
small
and
many
of
them
dark
among
the
paintings
the
most
remarkable
is
the
madonna
de
la
seggiola
by
raphael
counted
one
of
the
best
coloured
pieces
of
that
great
master
if
i
was
allowed
to
find
fault
with
the
performance
i
should
pronounce
it
defective
in
dignity
and
sentiment
it
is
the
expression
of
a
peasant
rather
than
of
the
mother
of
god
she
exhibits
the
fondness
and
joy
of
a
young
woman
towards
her
firstborn
son
without
that
rapture
of
admiration
which
we
expect
to
find
in
the
virgin
mary
while
she
contemplates
in
the
fruit
of
her
own
womb
the
saviour
of
mankind
in
other
respects
it
is
a
fine
figure
gay
agreeable
and
very
expressive
of
maternal
tenderness
and
the
bambino
is
extremely
beautiful
there
was
an
english
painter
employed
in
copying
this
picture
and
what
he
had
done
was
executed
with
great
success
i
am
one
of
those
who
think
it
very
possible
to
imitate
the
best
pieces
in
such
a
manner
that
even
the
connoisseurs
shall
not
be
able
to
distinguish
the
original
from
the
copy
after
all
i
do
not
set
up
for
a
judge
in
these
matters
and
very
likely
i
may
incur
the
ridicule
of
the
virtuosi
for
the
remarks
i
have
made
but
i
am
used
to
speak
my
mind
freely
on
all
subjects
that
fall
under
the
cognizance
of
my
senses
though
i
must
as
freely
own
there
is
something
more
than
common
sense
required
to
discover
and
distinguish
the
more
delicate
beauties
of
painting
i
can
safely
say
however
that
without
any
daubing
at
all
i
am
very
sincerely
your
affectionate
humble
servant
letter
xxix
nice
february
dear
sir
having
seen
all
the
curiosities
of
florence
and
hired
a
good
travelling
coach
for
seven
weeks
at
the
price
of
seven
zequines
something
less
than
three
guineas
and
a
half
we
set
out
post
for
rome
by
the
way
of
sienna
where
we
lay
the
first
night
the
country
through
which
we
passed
is
mountainous
but
agreeable
of
sienna
i
can
say
nothing
from
my
own
observation
but
that
we
were
indifferently
lodged
in
a
house
that
stunk
like
a
privy
and
fared
wretchedly
at
supper
the
city
is
large
and
well
built
the
inhabitants
pique
themselves
upon
their
politeness
and
the
purity
of
their
dialect
certain
it
is
some
strangers
reside
in
this
place
on
purpose
to
learn
the
best
pronunciation
of
the
italian
tongue
the
mosaic
pavement
of
their
duomo
or
cathedral
has
been
much
admired
as
well
as
the
history
of
aeneas
sylvius
afterwards
pope
pius
painted
on
the
walls
of
the
library
partly
by
pietro
perugino
and
partly
by
his
pupil
raphael
next
day
at
buon
convento
where
the
emperor
henry
vii
was
poisoned
by
a
friar
with
the
sacramental
wafer
i
refused
to
give
money
to
the
hostler
who
in
revenge
put
two
young
unbroke
in
the
traces
next
to
the
coach
which
became
so
unruly
that
before
we
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
they
and
the
postilion
were
rolling
in
the
dust
in
this
situation
they
made
such
efforts
to
disengage
themselves
and
kicked
with
such
violence
that
i
imagined
the
carriage
and
all
our
trunks
would
have
been
beaten
in
pieces
we
leaped
out
of
the
coach
however
without
sustaining
any
personal
damage
except
the
fright
nor
was
any
hurt
done
to
the
vehicle
but
the
horses
were
terribly
bruised
and
almost
strangled
before
they
could
be
disengaged
exasperated
at
the
villany
of
the
hostler
i
resolved
to
make
a
complaint
to
the
uffiziale
or
magistrate
of
the
place
i
found
him
wrapped
in
an
old
greasy
ragged
sitting
in
a
wretched
apartment
without
either
glass
paper
or
boards
in
the
windows
and
there
was
no
sort
of
furniture
but
a
couple
of
broken
chairs
and
a
miserable
he
looked
pale
and
meagre
and
had
more
the
air
of
a
prisoner
than
of
a
magistrate
having
heard
my
complaint
he
came
forth
into
a
kind
of
outward
room
or
bellfrey
and
rung
a
great
bell
with
his
own
hand
in
consequence
of
this
signal
the
postmaster
came
up
stairs
and
i
suppose
he
was
the
first
man
in
the
place
for
the
uffiziale
stood
before
him
and
with
great
marks
of
humble
respect
repeated
the
complaint
i
had
made
this
man
assured
me
with
an
air
of
conscious
importance
that
he
himself
had
ordered
the
hostler
to
supply
me
with
those
very
horses
which
were
the
best
in
his
stable
and
that
the
misfortune
which
happened
was
owing
to
the
misconduct
of
the
who
did
not
keep
the
to
a
proper
speed
proportioned
to
the
mettle
of
the
other
two
as
he
took
the
affair
upon
himself
and
i
perceived
had
an
ascendancy
over
the
magistrate
i
contented
myself
with
saying
i
was
certain
the
two
horses
had
been
put
to
the
coach
on
purpose
either
to
hurt
or
frighten
us
and
that
since
i
could
not
have
justice
here
i
would
make
a
formal
complaint
to
the
british
minister
at
florence
in
passing
through
the
street
to
the
coach
which
was
by
this
time
furnished
with
fresh
horses
i
met
the
hostler
and
would
have
caned
him
heartily
but
perceiving
my
intention
he
took
to
his
heels
and
vanished
of
all
the
people
i
have
ever
seen
the
hostlers
postilions
and
other
fellows
hanging
about
the
in
italy
are
the
most
greedy
impertinent
and
provoking
happy
are
those
travellers
who
have
phlegm
enough
to
disregard
their
insolence
and
importunity
for
this
is
not
so
disagreeable
as
their
revenge
is
dangerous
an
english
gentleman
at
florence
told
me
that
one
of
those
fellows
whom
he
had
struck
for
his
impertinence
flew
at
him
with
a
long
knife
and
he
could
hardly
keep
him
at
sword
point
all
of
them
wear
such
knives
and
are
very
apt
to
use
them
on
the
slightest
provocation
but
their
open
attacks
are
not
so
formidable
as
their
premeditated
schemes
of
revenge
in
the
prosecution
of
which
the
italians
are
equally
treacherous
and
cruel
this
night
we
passed
at
a
place
called
radicofani
a
village
and
fort
situated
on
the
top
of
a
very
high
mountain
the
inn
stands
still
lower
than
the
town
it
was
built
at
the
expence
of
the
last
of
tuscany
is
very
large
very
cold
and
uncomfortable
one
would
imagine
it
was
contrived
for
coolness
though
situated
so
high
that
even
in
the
midst
of
summer
a
traveller
would
be
glad
to
have
a
fire
in
his
chamber
but
few
or
none
of
them
have
fireplaces
and
there
is
not
a
bed
with
curtains
or
tester
in
the
house
all
the
adjacent
country
is
naked
and
barren
on
the
third
day
we
entered
the
pope
territories
some
parts
of
which
are
delightful
having
passed
a
beggarly
town
situated
on
the
top
of
a
rock
from
whence
there
is
a
romantic
cascade
of
water
which
gives
it
the
name
we
travelled
along
the
side
of
the
lake
bolsena
a
beautiful
piece
of
water
about
thirty
miles
in
circuit
with
two
islands
in
the
middle
the
banks
covered
with
noble
plantations
of
oak
and
cypress
the
town
of
bolsena
standing
near
the
ruins
of
the
antient
volsinium
which
was
the
of
sejanus
is
a
paultry
village
and
montefiascone
famous
for
its
wine
is
a
poor
decayed
town
in
this
neighbourhood
situated
on
the
side
of
a
hill
which
according
to
the
author
of
the
grand
tour
the
only
directory
i
had
along
with
me
is
supposed
to
be
the
soracte
of
the
ancients
if
we
may
believe
horace
soracte
was
visible
from
rome
for
in
his
ninth
ode
addressed
to
thaliarchus
he
says
vides
ut
alta
stet
nive
candidum
soracte
you
see
how
deeply
wreathed
with
snow
soracte
lifts
his

in
order
to

have
penetrated
through
the

at
the
foot
of
which
now
stands
the
city
of
viterbo
pliny
tells
us
that
soracte
was

montefiascone

from

says
it
is
now
called
monte
oreste
addison
tells
us
he
passed
by
it
in
the
campania
i
could
not
without
indignation
reflect
upon
the
bigotry
of
mathilda
who
gave
this
fine
country
to
the
see
of
rome
under
the
dominion
of
which
no
country
was
ever
known
to
prosper
about
half
way
between
montefiascone
and
viterbo
one
of
our
flew
off
together
with
a
large
splinter
of
the
and
if
one
of
the
postilions
had
not
by
great
accident
been
a
remarkably
ingenious
fellow
we
should
have
been
put
to
the
greatest
inconvenience
as
there
was
no
town
or
even
house
within
several
miles
i
mention
this
circumstance
by
way
of
warning
to
other
travellers
that
they
may
provide
themselves
with
a
hammer
and
nails
a
spare
or
two
a
large
knife
and
bladder
of
grease
to
be
used
occasionally
in
case
of
such
misfortune
the
mountain
of
viterbo
is
covered
with
beautiful
plantations
and
villas
belonging
to
the
roman
nobility
who
come
hither
to
make
the
villegiatura
in
summer
of
the
city
of
viterbo
i
shall
say
nothing
but
that
it
is
the
capital
of
that
country
which
mathilda
gave
to
the
roman
see
the
place
is
well
built
adorned
with
public
fountains
and
a
great
number
of
churches
and
convents
yet
far
from
being
populous
the
whole
number
of
inhabitants
not
exceeding
fifteen
thousand
the
is
one
of
the
worst
inns
i
ever
entered
after
having
passed
this
mountain
the
cyminus
of
the
antients
we
skirted
part
of
the
lake
which
is
now
called
de
vico
and
whose
banks
afford
the
most
agreeable
rural
prospects
of
hill
and
vale
wood
glade
and
water
shade
and
a
few
other
very
inconsiderable
places
we
passed
and
descended
into
the
campania
of
rome
which
is
almost
a
desert
the
view
of
this
country
in
its
present
situation
can
not
but
produce
emotions
of
pity
and
indignation
in
the
mind
of
every
person
who
retains
any
idea
of
its
antient
cultivation
and
fertility
it
is
nothing
but
a
naked
withered
down
desolate
and
dreary
almost
without
inclosure
hedge
tree
shrub
house
hut
or
habitation
exhibiting
here
and
there
the
ruins
of
an
antient
castellum
tomb
or
temple
and
in
some
places
the
remains
of
a
roman
via
i
had
heard
much
of
these
antient
pavements
and
was
greatly
disappointed
when
i
saw
them
the
via
cassia
or
cymina
is
paved
with
broad
solid
which
must
have
greatly
incommoded
the
feet
of
horses
that
travelled
upon
it
as
well
as
endangered
the
lives
of
the
riders
from
the
slipperiness
of
the
pavement
besides
it
is
so
narrow
that
two
modern
carriages
could
not
pass
one
another
upon
it
without
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
being
overturned
i
am
still
of
opinion
that
we
excel
the
ancient
romans
in
understanding
the
conveniences
of
life
the
grand
tour
says
that
within
four
miles
of
rome
you
see
a
tomb
on
the
roadside
said
to
be
that
of
nero
with
sculpture
in
at
both
ends
i
did
see
such
a
thing
more
like
a
common
than
the
tomb
of
an
emperor
but
we
are
informed
by
suetonius
that
the
dead
body
of
nero
who
slew
himself
at
the
villa
of
his
freedman
was
by
the
care
of
his
two
nurses
and
his
concubine
atta
removed
to
the
sepulchre
of
the
gens
domitia
immediately
within
the
porta
del
popolo
on
your
left
hand
as
you
enter
rome
precisely
on
the
spot
where
now
stands
the
church
of
maria
del
popolo
his
tomb
was
even
distinguished
by
an
epitaph
which
has
been
preserved
by
gruterus
giacomo
alberici
tells
us
very
gravely
in
his
history
of
the
church
that
a
great
number
of
devils
who
guarded
the
bones
of
this
wicked
emperor
took
possession
in
the
shape
of
black
ravens
of
a
which
grew
upon
the
spot
from
whence
they
insulted
every
passenger
until
pope
paschal
in
consequence
of
a
solemn
fast
and
a
revelation
went
thither
in
procession
with
his
court
and
cardinals
cut
down
the
tree
and
burned
it
to
ashes
which
with
the
bones
of
nero
were
thrown
into
the
tyber
then
he
consecrated
an
altar
on
the
place
where
afterwards
the
church
was
built
you
may
guess
what
i
felt
at
first
sight
of
the
city
of
rome
which
notwithstanding
all
the
calamities
it
has
undergone
still
maintains
an
august
and
imperial
appearance
it
stands
on
the
farther
side
of
the
tyber
which
we
crossed
at
the
ponte
molle
formerly
called
pons
milvius
about
two
miles
from
the
gate
by
which
we
entered
this
bridge
was
built
by
aemilius
censor
whose
name
it
originally
bore
it
was
the
road
by
which
so
many
heroes
returned
with
conquest
to
their
country
by
which
so
many
kings
were
led
captive
to
rome
and
by
which
the
ambassadors
of
so
many
kingdoms
and
states
approached
the
seat
of
empire
to
deprecate
the
wrath
to
sollicit
the
friendship
or
sue
for
the
protection
of
the
roman
people
it
is
likewise
famous
for
the
defeat
and
death
of
maxentius
who
was
here
overcome
by
constantine
the
great
the
space
between
the
bridge
and
porta
del
popolo
on
the
which
is
now
taken
up
with
gardens
and
villas
was
part
of
the
antient
campus
martius
where
the
comitiae
were
held
and
where
the
roman
people
inured
themselves
to
all
manner
of
exercises
it
was
adorned
with
porticos
temples
theatres
baths
circi
basilicae
obelisks
columns
statues
and
groves
authors
differ
in
their
opinions
about
the
extent
of
it
but
as
they
all
agree
that
it
contained
the
pantheon
the
circus
agonis
now
the
piazza
navona
the
bustum
and
mausoleum
augusti
great
part
of
the
modern
city
must
be
built
upon
the
ancient
campus
martius
the
highway
that
leads
from
the
bridge
to
the
city
is
part
of
the
via
flaminia
which
extended
as
far
as
rimini
and
is
well
paved
like
a
modern
street
nothing
of
the
antient
bridge
remains
but
the
piles
nor
is
there
any
thing
in
the
structure
of
this
or
of
the
other
five
roman
bridges
over
the
tyber
that
deserves
attention
i
have
not
seen
any
bridge
in
france
or
italy
comparable
to
that
of
westminster
either
in
beauty
magnificence
or
solidity
and
when
the
bridge
at
is
finished
it
will
be
such
a
monument
of
architecture
as
all
the
world
can
not
parallel
as
for
the
tyber
it
is
in
comparison
with
the
thames
no
more
than
an
inconsiderable
stream
foul
deep
and
rapid
it
is
navigable
by
small
boats
barks
and
lighters
and
for
the
conveniency
of
loading
and
unloading
them
there
is
a
handsome
quay
by
the
new
at
the
porto
di
ripetta
provided
with
stairs
of
each
side
and
adorned
with
an
elegant
fountain
that
yields
abundance
of
excellent
water
we
are
told
that
the
bed
of
this
river
has
been
considerably
raised
by
the
rubbish
of
old
rome
and
this
is
the
reason
usually
given
for
its
being
so
apt
to
overflow
its
banks
a
citizen
of
rome
told
me
that
a
friend
of
his
lately
digging
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
house
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
near
the
bank
of
the
river
discovered
the
pavement
of
an
antient
street
at
the
depth
of
feet
from
the
present
surface
of
the
earth
he
therefore
concluded
that
modern
rome
is
near
forty
feet
higher
in
this
place
than
the
site
of
the
antient
city
and
that
the
bed
of
the
river
is
raised
in
proportion
but
this
is
altogether
incredible
had
the
bed
of
the
tyber
been
antiently
forty
feet
lower
at
rome
than
it
is
at
present
there
must
have
been
a
fall
or
cataract
in
it
immediately
above
this
tract
as
it
is
not
pretended
that
the
bed
of
it
is
raised
in
any
part
above
the
city
otherwise
such
an
elevation
would
have
obstructed
its
course
and
then
it
would
have
overflowed
the
whole
campania
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
its
present
overflowings
they
frequently
happened
of
old
and
did
great
mischief
to
the
antient
city
appian
dio
and
other
historians
describe
an
inundation
of
the
tiber
immediately
after
the
death
of
julius
caesar
which
inundation
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
melting
of
a
great
quantity
of
snow
upon
the
apennines
this
calamity
is
recorded
by
horace
in
his
ode

the
porta

formerly
flaminia
by
which
we
entered
rome
is
an
elegant
piece
of
architecture
adorned
with
marble
columns
and
statues
executed
after
the
design
of
buonaroti
you
find
yourself
in
a
noble
piazza
from
whence
three
of
the
principal
streets
of
rome
are
detached
it
is
adorned
with
the
famous
aegyptian
obelisk
brought
hither
from
the
circus
maximus
and
set
up
by
the
architect
dominico
fontana
in
the
pontificate
of
sixtus
here
is
likewise
a
beautiful
fountain
designed
by
the
same
artist
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
two
principal
streets
are
two
very
elegant
churches
fronting
each
other
such
an
august
entrance
can
not
fail
to
impress
a
stranger
with
a
sublime
idea
of
this
venerable
city
having
given
our
names
at
the
gate
we
repaired
to
the
dogana
or
where
our
trunks
and
carriage
were
searched
and
here
we
were
surrounded
by
a
number
of
servitori
de
piazza
offering
their
services
with
the
most
disagreeable
importunity
though
i
told
them
several
times
i
had
no
occasion
for
any
three
of
them
took
possession
of
the
coach
one
mounting
before
and
two
of
them
behind
and
thus
we
proceeded
to
the
piazza
where
the
person
lived
to
whose
house
i
was
directed
strangers
that
come
to
rome
seldom
put
up
at
public
inns
but
go
directly
to
lodging
houses
of
which
there
is
great
plenty
in
this
quarter
the
piazza
is
open
airy
and
pleasantly
situated
in
a
high
part
of
the
city
immediately
under
the
colla
pinciana
and
adorned
with
two
fine
fountains
here
most
of
the
english
reside
the
apartments
are
generally
commodious
and
well
furnished
and
the
lodgers
are
well
supplied
with
provisions
and
all
necessaries
of
life
but
if
i
studied
oeconomy
i
would
choose
another
part
of
the
town
than
the
piazza
which
is
besides
at
a
great
distance
from
the
antiquities
for
a
decent
first
floor
and
two
on
the
second
i
payed
no
more
than
a
scudo
five
shillings
per
day
our
table
was
plentifully
furnished
by
the
landlord
for
two
and
thirty
pauls
being
equal
to
sixteen
shillings
i
hired
a
at
the
rate
of
fourteen
pauls
or
seven
shillings
a
day
and
a
servitore
di
piazza
for
three
pauls
or
the
coachman
has
also
an
allowance
of
two
pauls
a
day
the
provisions
at
rome
are
reasonable
and
good
the
vitella
mongana
however
which
is
the
most
delicate
veal
i
ever
tasted
is
very
dear
being
sold
for
two
pauls
or
a
shilling
the
pound
here
are
the
rich
wines
of
montepulciano
montefiascone
and
monte
di
dragone
but
what
we
commonly
drink
at
meals
is
that
of
orvieto
a
small
white
wine
of
an
agreeable
flavour
strangers
are
generally
advised
to
employ
an
antiquarian
to
instruct
them
in
all
the
curiosities
of
rome
and
this
is
a
necessary
expence
when
a
person
wants
to
become
a
connoisseur
in
painting
statuary
and
architecture
for
my
own
part
i
had
no
such
ambition
i
longed
to
view
the
remains
of
antiquity
by
which
this
metropolis
is
distinguished
and
to
contemplate
the
originals
of
many
pictures
and
statues
which
i
had
admired
in
prints
and
descriptions
i
therefore
chose
a
servant
who
was
recommended
to
me
as
a
sober
intelligent
fellow
acquainted
with
these
matters
at
the
same
time
i
furnished
myself
with
maps
and
plans
of
antient
and
modern
rome
together
with
the
little
manual
called
itinerario
istruttivo
per
ritrovare
con
facilita
tutte
le
magnificenze
di
roma
e
di
alcune
citta
e
castelli
suburbani
but
i
found
still
more
satisfaction
in
perusing
the
book
in
three
volumes
intitled
roma
antica
e
moderna
which
contains
a
description
of
everything
remarkable
in
and
about
the
city
illustrated
with
a
great
number
of
and
many
curious
historical
annotations
this
directory
cost
me
a
zequine
but
a
hundred
zequines
will
not
purchase
all
the
books
and
prints
which
have
been
published
at
rome
on
these
subjects
of
these
the
most
celebrated
are
the
plates
of
piranesi
who
is
not
only
an
ingenious
architect
and
engraver
but
also
a
learned
antiquarian
though
he
is
apt
to
run
riot
in
his
conjectures
and
with
regard
to
the
arts
of
antient
rome
has
broached
some
doctrines
which
he
will
find
it
very
difficult
to
maintain
our
young
gentlemen
who
go
to
rome
will
do
well
to
be
upon
their
guard
against
a
set
of
sharpers
some
of
them
of
our
own
country
who
deal
in
pictures
and
antiques
and
very
often
impose
upon
the
uninformed
stranger
by
selling
him
trash
as
the
productions
of
the
most
celebrated
artists
the
english
are
more
than
any
other
foreigners
exposed
to
this
imposition
they
are
supposed
to
have
more
money
to
throw
away
and
therefore
a
greater
number
of
snares
are
laid
for
them
this
opinion
of
their
superior
wealth
they
take
a
pride
in
confirming
by
launching
out
into
all
manner
of
unnecessary
expence
but
what
is
still
more
dangerous
the
moment
they
set
foot
in
italy
they
are
seized
with
the
ambition
of
becoming
connoisseurs
in
painting
musick
statuary
and
architecture
and
the
adventurers
of
this
country
do
not
fail
to
flatter
this
weakness
for
their
own
advantage
i
have
seen
in
different
parts
of
italy
a
number
of
raw
boys
whom
britain
seemed
to
have
poured
forth
on
purpose
to
bring
her
national
character
into
contempt
ignorant
petulant
rash
and
profligate
without
any
knowledge
or
experience
of
their
own
without
any
director
to
improve
their
understanding
or
superintend
their
conduct
one
engages
in
play
with
an
infamous
gamester
and
is
stripped
perhaps
in
the
very
first
partie
another
is
pillaged
by
an
antiquated
cantatrice
a
third
is
bubbled
by
a
knavish
antiquarian
and
a
fourth
is
laid
under
contribution
by
a
dealer
in
pictures
some
turn
fiddlers
and
pretend
to
compose
but
all
of
them
talk
familiarly
of
the
arts
and
return
finished
connoisseurs
and
coxcombs
to
their
own
country
the
most
remarkable
phaenomenon
of
this
kind
which
i
have
seen
is
a
boy
of
now
actually
travelling
through
italy
for
improvement
under
the
auspices
of
another
boy
of
when
you
arrive
at
rome
you
receive
cards
from
all
your
in
that
city
they
expect
to
have
the
visit
returned
next
day
when
they
give
orders
not
to
be
at
home
and
you
never
speak
to
one
another
in
the
sequel
this
is
a
refinement
in
hospitality
and
politeness
which
the
english
have
invented
by
the
strength
of
their
own
genius
without
any
assistance
either
from
france
italy
or
lapland
no
englishman
above
the
degree
of
a
painter
or
cicerone
frequents
any
at
rome
and
as
there
are
no
public
diversions
except
in
the
only
chance
you
have
of
seeing
your
compatriots
is
either
in
visiting
the
curiosities
or
at
a
conversazione
the
italians
are
very
scrupulous
in
admitting
foreigners
except
those
who
are
introduced
as
people
of
quality
but
if
there
happens
to
be
any
english
lady
of
fashion
at
rome
she
generally
keeps
an
assembly
to
which
the
british
subjects
resort
in
my
next
i
shall
communicate
without
ceremony
or
affectation
what
further
remarks
i
have
made
at
rome
without
any
pretence
however
to
the
character
of
a
connoisseur
which
without
all
doubt
would
fit
very
aukwardly
upon
dear
sir
your
friend
and
servant
letter
xxx
nice
february
dear
sir
nothing
can
be
more
agreeable
to
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
especially
in
the
heats
of
summer
than
the
great
number
of
public
fountains
that
appear
in
every
part
of
rome
embellished
with
all
the
ornaments
of
sculpture
and
pouring
forth
prodigious
quantities
of
cool
delicious
water
brought
in
aqueducts
from
different
lakes
rivers
and
sources
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
city
these
works
are
the
remains
of
the
munificence
and
industry
of
the
antient
romans
who
were
extremely
delicate
in
the
article
of
water
but
however
great
applause
is
also
due
to
those
beneficent
popes
who
have
been
at
the
expence
of
restoring
and
repairing
those
noble
channels
of
health
pleasure
and
convenience
this
great
plenty
of
water
nevertheless
has
not
induced
the
romans
to
be
cleanly
their
streets
and
even
their
palaces
are
disgraced
with
filth
the
noble
piazza
navona
is
adorned
with
three
or
four
fountains
one
of
which
is
perhaps
the
most
magnificent
in
europe
and
all
of
them
discharge
vast
streams
of
water
but
notwithstanding
this
provision
the
piazza
is
almost
as
dirty
as
west
smithfield
where
the
cattle
are
sold
in
london
the
corridores
arcades
and
even
staircases
of
their
most
elegant
palaces
are
depositories
of
nastiness
and
indeed
in
summer
smell
as
strong
as
spirit
of
hartshorn
i
have
a
great
notion
that
their
ancestors
were
not
much
more
cleanly
if
we
consider
that
the
city
and
suburbs
of
rome
in
the
reign
of
claudius
contained
about
seven
millions
of
inhabitants
a
number
equal
at
least
to
the
sum
total
of
all
the
souls
in
england
that
great
part
of
antient
rome
was
allotted
to
temples
porticos
basilicae
theatres
thermae
circi
public
and
private
walks
and
gardens
where
very
few
if
any
of
this
great
number
lodged
that
by
far
the
greater
part
of
those
inhabitants
were
slaves
and
poor
people
who
did
not
enjoy
the
conveniencies
of
life
and
that
the
use
of
linen
was
scarce
known
we
must
naturally
conclude
they
were
strangely
crouded
together
and
that
in
general
they
were
a
very
frowzy
generation
that
they
were
crouded
together
appears
from
the
height
of
their
houses
which
the
poet
rutilius
compared
to
towers
made
for
scaling
heaven
in
order
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
augustus
caesar
published
a
decree
that
for
the
future
no
houses
should
be
built
above
seventy
feet
high
which
at
a
moderate
computation
might
make
six
stories
but
what
seems
to
prove
beyond
all
dispute
that
the
antient
romans
were
dirty
creatures
are
these
two
particulars
vespasian
laid
a
tax
upon
urine
and
ordure
on
pretence
of
being
at
a
great
expence
in
clearing
the
streets
from
such
nuisances
an
imposition
which
amounted
to
about
fourteen
pence
a
year
for
every
individual
and
when
heliogabalus
ordered
all
the
cobwebs
of
the
city
and
suburbs
to
be
collected
they
were
found
to
weigh
ten
thousand
pounds
this
was
intended
as
a
demonstration
of
the
great
number
of
inhabitants
but
it
was
a
proof
of
their
dirt
rather
than
of
their
populosity
i
might
likewise
add
the
delicate
custom
of
taking
vomits
at
each
other
houses
when
they
were
invited
to
dinner
or
supper
that
they
might
prepare
their
stomachs
for
gormandizing
a
beastly
proof
of
their
nastiness
as
well
as
gluttony
horace
in
his
description
of
the
banquet
of
nasiedenus
says
when
the
canopy
under
which
they
sat
fell
down
it
brought
along
with
it
as
much
dirt
as
is
raised
by
a
hard
gale
of
wind
in
dry
weather
trahentia
pulveris
atri
quantum
non
aquilo
campanis
excitat
agris
such
clouds
of
dust
revolving
in
its
train
as
boreas
whirls
along
the
level
plain
i
might
observe
that
the
streets
were
often
encumbered
with
the
putrefying
carcasses
of
criminals
who
had
been
dragged
through
them
by
the
heels
and
precipitated
from
the
scalae
gemoniae
or
tarpeian
rock
before
they
were
thrown
into
the
tyber
which
was
the
general
receptacle
of
the
cloaca
maxima
and
all
the
filth
of
rome
besides
the
bodies
of
all
those
who
made
away
with
themselves
without
sufficient
cause
of
such
as
were
condemned
for
sacrilege
or
killed
by
thunder
were
left
unburned
and
unburied
to
rot
above
ground
i
believe
the
moderns
retain
more
of
the
customs
of
antient
romans
than
is
generally
imagined
when
i
first
saw
the
infants
at
the
enfans
trouves
in
paris
so
swathed
with
bandages
that
the
very
sight
of
them
made
my
eyes
water
i
little
dreamed
that
the
prescription
of
the
antients
could
be
pleaded
for
this
custom
equally
shocking
and
absurd
but
in
the
capitol
at
rome
i
met
with
the
antique
statue
of
a
child
swaddled
exactly
in
the
same
manner
rolled
up
like
an
aegyptian
mummy
from
the
feet
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
such
a
case
must
be
obstructed
on
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
and
nothing
be
at
liberty
but
the
head
which
is
the
only
part
of
the
child
that
ought
to
be
confined
is
it
not
surprising
that
common
sense
should
not
point
out
even
to
the
most
ignorant
that
those
accursed
bandages
must
heat
the
tender
infant
into
a
fever
must
hinder
the
action
of
the
muscles
and
the
play
of
the
joints
so
necessary
to
health
and
nutrition
and
that
while
the
refluent
blood
is
obstructed
in
the
veins
which
run
on
the
surface
of
the
body
the
arteries
which
lie
deep
without
the
reach
of
compression
are
continually
pouring
their
contents
into
the
head
where
the
blood
meets
with
no
resistance
the
vessels
of
the
brain
are
naturally
lax
and
the
very
sutures
of
the
skull
are
yet
unclosed
what
are
the
consequences
of
this
cruel
swaddling
the
limbs
are
wasted
the
joints
grow
rickety
the
brain
is
compressed
and
a
hydrocephalus
with
a
great
head
and
sore
eyes
ensues
i
take
this
abominable
practice
to
be
one
great
cause
of
the
bandy
legs
diminutive
bodies
and
large
heads
so
frequent
in
the
south
of
france
and
in
italy
i
was
no
less
surprised
to
find
the
modern
fashion
of
curling
the
hair
borrowed
in
a
great
measure
from
the
coxcombs
and
coquettes
of
antiquity
i
saw
a
bust
of
nero
in
the
gallery
at
florence
the
hair
represented
in
rows
of
buckles
like
that
of
a
french
conformable
to
the
picture
drawn
of
him
by
suetonius
circa
cultum
adeo
pudendum
ut
coman
semper
in
gradus
formatam
peregrinatione
achaica
etiam
pene
verticem
sumpserit
so
very
finical
in
his
dress
that
he
wore
his
hair
in
the
greek
fashion
curled
in
rows
almost
to
the
crown
of
his
head
i
was
very
sorry
however
to
find
that
this
foppery
came
from
greece
as
for
otho
he
wore
a
galericulum
or
tour
on
account
of
thin
hair
propter
raritatem
capillorum
he
had
no
right
to
imitate
the
example
of
julius
caesar
who
concealed
his
bald
head
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
but
there
is
a
bust
in
the
capitol
of
julia
pia
the
second
wife
of
septimius
severus
with
a
moveable
peruke
dressed
exactly
in
the
fashionable
mode
with
this
difference
that
there
is
no
part
of
it
frizzled
nor
is
there
any
appearance
of
pomatum
and
powder
these
improvements
the
have
borrowed
from
the
natives
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
modern
rome
does
not
cover
more
than
of
the
space
within
the
walls
and
those
parts
that
were
most
frequented
of
old
are
now
intirely
abandoned
from
the
capitol
to
the
coliseo
including
the
forum
romanum
and
boarium
there
is
nothing
intire
but
one
or
two
churches
built
with
the
fragments
of
ancient
edifices
you
descend
from
the
capitol
between
the
remaining
pillars
of
two
temples
the
pedestals
and
part
of
the
shafts
sunk
in
the
rubbish
then
passing
through
the
triumphal
arch
of
septimius
severus
you
proceed
along
the
foot
of
mons
palatinus
which
stands
on
your
right
hand
quite
covered
with
the
ruins
of
the
antient
palace
belonging
to
the
roman
emperors
and
at
the
foot
of
it
there
are
some
beautiful
detached
pillars
still
standing
on
the
left
you
see
the
remains
of
the
templum
pacis
which
seems
to
have
been
the
largest
and
most
magnificent
of
all
the
temples
in
rome
it
was
built
and
dedicated
by
the
emperor
vespasian
who
brought
into
it
all
the
treasure
and
precious
vessels
which
he
found
in
the
temple
of
jerusalem
the
columns
of
the
portico
he
removed
from
nero
golden
house
which
he
levelled
with
the
ground
this
temple
was
likewise
famous
for
its
library
mentioned
by
aulus
gellius
further
on
is
the
arch
of
constantine
on
the
right
a
most
noble
piece
of
architecture
almost
entire
with
the
remains
of
the
meta
sudans
before
it
and
fronting
you
the
noble
ruins
of
that
vast
amphitheatre
called
the
colossaeum
now
coliseo
which
has
been
dismantled
and
dilapidated
by
the
gothic
popes
and
princes
of
modern
rome
to
build
and
adorn
their
paultry
palaces
behind
the
amphitheatre
were
the
thermae
of
the
same
emperor
titus
vespasian
in
the
same
quarter
was
the
circus
maximus
and
the
whole
space
from
hence
on
both
sides
to
the
walls
of
rome
comprehending
above
twice
as
much
ground
as
the
modern
city
is
almost
covered
with
the
monuments
of
antiquity
i
suppose
there
is
more
concealed
below
ground
than
appears
above
the
miserable
houses
and
even
of
the
peasants
in
this
district
are
built
with
these
precious
materials
i
mean
shafts
and
capitals
of
marble
columns
heads
arms
legs
and
mutilated
trunks
of
statues
what
pity
it
is
that
among
all
the
remains
of
antiquity
at
rome
there
is
not
one
remaining
i
should
be
glad
to
know
how
the
senators
of
rome
were
lodged
i
want
to
be
better
informed
touching
the
cava
aedium
the
focus
the
ara
deorum
penatum
the
conclavia
triclinia
and
caenationes
the
atria
where
the
women
resided
and
employed
themselves
in
the
woolen
manufacture
the
praetoria
which
were
so
spacious
as
to
become
a
nuisance
in
the
reign
of
augustus
and
the
xysta
which
were
shady
walks
between
two
porticos
where
the
men
exercised
themselves
in
the
winter
i
am
disgusted
by
the
modern
taste
of
architecture
though
i
am
no
judge
of
the
art
the
churches
and
palaces
of
these
days
are
crowded
with
pretty
ornaments
which
distract
the
eye
and
by
breaking
the
design
into
a
variety
of
little
parts
destroy
the
effect
of
the
whole
every
door
and
window
has
its
separate
ornaments
its
moulding
frize
cornice
and
tympanum
then
there
is
such
an
assemblage
of
useless
festoons
pillars
pilasters
with
their
architraves
entablatures
and
i
know
not
what
that
nothing
great
or
uniform
remains
to
fill
the
view
and
we
in
vain
look
for
that
simplicity
of
grandeur
those
large
masses
of
light
and
shadow
and
the
inexpressible
eusuinopton
which
characterise
the
edifices
of
the
antients
a
great
edifice
to
have
its
full
effect
ought
to
be
isole
or
detached
from
all
others
with
a
large
space
around
it
but
the
palaces
of
rome
and
indeed
of
all
the
other
cities
of
italy
which
i
have
seen
are
so
engaged
among
other
mean
houses
that
their
beauty
and
magnificence
are
in
a
great
measure
concealed
even
those
which
face
open
streets
and
piazzas
are
only
clear
in
front
the
other
apartments
are
darkened
by
the
vicinity
of
ordinary
houses
and
their
views
are
confined
by
dirty
and
disagreeable
objects
within
the
court
there
is
generally
a
noble
colonnade
all
round
and
an
open
corridore
above
but
the
stairs
are
usually
narrow
steep
and
high
the
want
of
the
dullness
of
their
small
glass
lozenges
the
dusty
brick
floors
and
the
crimson
hangings
laced
with
gold
contribute
to
give
a
gloomy
air
to
their
apartments
i
might
add
to
these
causes
a
number
of
pictures
executed
on
melancholy
subjects
antique
mutilated
statues
busts
basso
relieves
urns
and
sepulchral
stones
with
which
their
rooms
are
adorned
it
must
be
owned
however
there
are
some
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
the
villa
of
cardinal
alexander
albani
is
light
gay
and
airy
yet
the
rooms
are
too
small
and
too
much
decorated
with
carving
and
gilding
which
is
a
kind
of
gingerbread
work
the
apartments
of
one
of
the
princes
borghese
are
furnished
in
the
english
taste
and
in
the
palazzo
di
colonna
connestabile
there
is
a
saloon
or
gallery
which
for
the
proportions
lights
furniture
and
ornaments
is
the
most
noble
elegant
and
agreeable
apartment
i
ever
saw
it
is
diverting
to
hear
all
italian
expatiate
upon
the
greatness
of
modern
rome
he
will
tell
you
there
are
above
three
hundred
palaces
in
the
city
that
there
is
scarce
a
roman
prince
whose
revenue
does
not
exceed
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
and
that
rome
produces
not
only
the
most
learned
men
but
also
the
most
refined
politicians
in
the
universe
to
one
of
them
talking
in
this
strain
i
replied
that
instead
of
three
hundred
palaces
the
number
did
not
exceed
fourscore
that
i
had
been
informed
on
good
authority
there
were
not
six
individuals
in
rome
who
had
so
much
as
forty
thousand
crowns
a
year
about
ten
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
that
to
say
their
princes
were
so
rich
and
their
politicians
so
refined
was
in
effect
a
severe
satire
upon
them
for
not
employing
their
wealth
and
their
talents
for
the
advantage
of
their
country
i
asked
why
their
cardinals
and
princes
did
not
invite
and
encourage
industrious
people
to
settle
and
cultivate
the
campania
of
rome
which
is
a
desert
why
they
did
not
raise
a
subscription
to
drain
the
marshes
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
and
thus
meliorate
the
air
which
is
rendered
extremely
unwholsome
in
the
summer
by
putrid
exhalations
from
those
morasses
i
demanded
of
him
why
they
did
not
contribute
their
wealth
and
exert
their
political
refinements
in
augmenting
their
forces
by
sea
and
land
for
the
defence
of
their
country
introducing
commerce
and
manufactures
and
in
giving
some
consequence
to
their
state
which
was
no
more
than
a
mite
in
the
political
scale
of
europe
i
expressed
a
desire
to
know
what
became
of
all
those
sums
of
money
inasmuch
as
there
was
hardly
any
circulation
of
gold
and
silver
in
rome
and
the
very
bankers
on
whom
strangers
have
their
credit
make
interest
to
pay
their
bills
with
paper
notes
of
the
bank
of
spirito
santo
and
now
i
am
upon
this
subject
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
that
i
was
strangely
misled
by
all
the
books
consulted
about
the
current
coin
of
italy
in
tuscany
and
the
ecclesiastical
state
one
sees
nothing
but
zequines
in
gold
and
pieces
of
two
paoli
one
paolo
and
half
a
paolo
in
silver
besides
these
there
is
a
copper
coin
at
rome
called
bajocco
and
mezzo
bajocco

rome
has
nothing
to
fear
from
the
catholic
powers
who
respect
it
with
a
superstitious
veneration
as
the

of
their
religion
but
the
popes
will
do
well
to
avoid
misunderstandings
with
the
maritime
protestant
states
especially
the
english
who
being
masters
of
the
mediterranean
and
in
possession
of
minorca
have
it
in
their
power
at
all
times
to
land
a
body
of
troops
within
four
leagues
of
rome
and
to
take
the
city
without
opposition
rome
is
surrounded
with
an
old
wall
but
altogether
incapable
of
defence
or
if
it
was
the
circuit
of
the
walls
is
so
extensive
that
it
would
require
a
garrison
of
twenty
thousand
men
the
only
appearance
of
a
fortification
in
this
city
is
the
castle
of
angelo
situated
on
the
further
bank
of
the
tyber
to
which
there
is
access
by
a
handsome
bridge
but
this
castle
which
was
formerly
the
moles
adriani
could
not
hold
out
half
a
day
against
a
battery
of
ten
pieces
of
cannon
properly
directed
it
was
an
expedient
left
to
the
invention
of
the
modern
romans
to
convert
an
ancient
tomb
into
a
citadel
it
could
only
serve
as
a
temporary
retreat
for
the
pope
in
times
of
popular
commotion
and
on
other
sudden
emergencies
as
it
happened
in
the
case
of
pope
clement
vii
when
the
troops
of
the
emperor
took
the
city
by
assault
and
this
only
while
he
resided
at
the
vatican
from
whence
there
is
a
covered
gallery
continued
to
the
castle
it
can
never
serve
this
purpose
again
while
the
pontiff
lives
on
monte
cavallo
which
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
city
the
castle
of
angelo
howsoever
ridiculous
as
a
fortress
appears
respectable
as
a
noble
monument
of
antiquity
and
though
standing
in
a
low
situation
is
one
of
the
first
objects
that
strike
the
eye
of
a
stranger
approaching
rome
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
are
the
wretched
remains
of
the
mausoleum
augusti
which
was
still
more
magnificent
part
of
the
walls
is
standing
and
the
terraces
are
converted
into
in
viewing
these
ruins
i

what
the

said
of

you
will
be
tempted
to
say
of
this
letter
which
i
shall
therefore
close
in
the
old
stile
assuring
you
that
i
ever
am
yours
most
affectionately
letter
xxxi
nice
march
dear
sir
in
my
last
i
gave
you
my
opinion
freely
of
the
modern
palaces
of
italy
i
shall
now
hazard
my
thoughts
upon
the
gardens
of
this
country
which
the
inhabitants
extol
with
all
the
hyperboles
of
admiration
and
applause
i
must
acknowledge
however
i
have
not
seen
the
famous
villas
at
frascati
and
tivoli
which
are
celebrated
for
their
gardens
and
waterworks
i
intended
to
visit
these
places
but
was
prevented
by
an
unexpected
change
of
weather
which
deterred
me
from
going
to
the
country
on
the
last
day
of
september
the
mountains
of
palestrina
were
covered
with
snow
and
the
air
became
so
cold
at
rome
that
i
was
forced
to
put
on
my
winter
cloaths
this
objection
continued
till
i
found
it
necessary
to
set
out
on
my
return
to
florence
but
i
have
seen
the
gardens
of
the
poggio
imperiale
and
the
palazzo
de
pitti
at
florence
and
those
of
the
vatican
of
the
palace
on
monte
cavallo
of
the
villa
ludovisia
medicea
and
pinciana
at
rome
so
that
i
think
i
have
some
right
to
judge
of
the
italian
taste
in
gardening
among
those
i
have
mentioned
that
of
the
villa
pinciana
is
the
most
remarkable
and
the
most
extensive
including
a
space
of
three
miles
in
circuit
hard
by
the
walls
of
rome
containing
a
variety
of
situations
high
and
low
which
favour
all
the
natural
embellishments
one
would
expect
to
meet
with
in
a
garden
and
exhibit
a
diversity
of
noble
views
of
the
city
and
adjacent
country
in
a
fine
extensive
garden
or
park
an
englishman
expects
to
see
a
number
of
groves
and
glades
intermixed
with
an
agreeable
negligence
which
seems
to
be
the
effect
of
nature
and
accident
he
looks
for
shady
walks
encrusted
with
gravel
for
open
lawns
covered
with
verdure
as
smooth
as
velvet
but
much
more
lively
and
agreeable
for
ponds
canals
basins
cascades
and
running
streams
of
water
for
clumps
of
trees
woods
and
wildernesses
cut
into
delightful
alleys
perfumed
with
honeysuckle
and
and
resounding
with
the
mingled
melody
of
all
the
singing
birds
of
heaven
he
looks
for
plats
of
flowers
in
different
parts
to
refresh
the
sense
and
please
the
fancy
for
arbours
grottos
hermitages
temples
and
alcoves
to
shelter
him
from
the
sun
and
afford
him
means
of
contemplation
and
repose
and
he
expects
to
find
the
hedges
groves
and
walks
and
lawns
kept
with
the
utmost
order
and
propriety
he
who
loves
the
beauties
of
simple
nature
and
the
charms
of
neatness
will
seek
for
them
in
vain
amidst
the
groves
of
italy
in
the
garden
of
the
villa
pinciana
there
is
a
plantation
of
four
hundred
pines
which
the
italians
view
with
rapture
and
admiration
there
is
likewise
a
long
walk
of
trees
extending
from
the
to
the
palace
and
plenty
of
shade
with
alleys
and
hedges
in
different
parts
of
the
ground
but
the
groves
are
neglected
the
walks
are
laid
with
nothing
but
common
mould
or
sand
black
and
dusty
the
hedges
are
tall
thin
and
shabby
the
trees
stunted
the
open
ground
brown
and
parched
has
scarce
any
appearance
of
verdure
the
flat
regular
alleys
of
evergreens
are
cut
into
fantastic
figures
the
flower
gardens
embellished
with
thin
cyphers
and
flourished
figures
in
box
while
the
flowers
grow
in
rows
of
and
the
ground
appears
as
dusky
as
if
it
was
covered
with
the
cinders
of
a
blacksmith
forge
the
water
of
which
there
is
great
plenty
instead
of
being
collected
in
large
pieces
or
conveyed
in
little
rivulets
and
streams
to
refresh
the
thirsty
soil
or
managed
so
as
to
form
agreeable
cascades
is
squirted
from
fountains
in
different
parts
of
the
garden
through
tubes
little
bigger
than
common
it
must
be
owned
indeed
that
the
fountains
have
their
merit
in
the
way
of
sculpture
and
architecture
and
that
here
is
a
great
number
of
statues
which
merit
attention
but
they
serve
only
to
encumber
the
ground
and
destroy
that
effect
of
rural
simplicity
which
our
gardens
are
designed
to
produce
in
a
word
here
we
see
a
variety
of
walks
and
groves
and
fountains
a
wood
of
four
hundred
pines
a
paddock
with
a
few
meagre
deer
a
an
aviary
a
grotto
and
a
and
in
spite
of
all
these
particulars
it
is
in
my
opinion
a
very
contemptible
garden
when
compared
to
that
of
stowe
in
buckinghamshire
or
even
to
those
of
kensington
and
richmond
the
italians
understand
because
they
study
the
excellencies
of
art
but
they
have
no
idea
of
the
beauties
of
nature
this
villa
pinciana
which
belongs
to
the
borghese
family
would
make
a
complete
academy
for
painting
and
sculpture
especially
for
the
study
of
antient
marbles
for
exclusive
of
the
statues
and
busts
in
the
garden
and
the
vast
collection
in
the
different
apartments
almost
the
whole
outside
of
the
house
is
covered
with
curious
pieces
in
basso
and
alto
relievo
the
most
masterly
is
that
of
curtius
on
horseback
leaping
into
the
gulph
or
opening
of
the
earth
which
is
said
to
have
closed
on
receiving
this
sacrifice
among
the
exhibitions
of
art
within
the
house
i
was
much
struck
with
a
bacchus
and
the
death
of
meleager
represented
on
an
antient
sepulchre
there
is
also
an
admirable
statue
of
silenus
with
the
infant
bacchus
in
his
arms
a
most
beautiful
gladiator
a
curious
moor
of
black
marble
with
a
shirt
of
white
alabaster
a
finely
proportioned
bull
of
black
marble
also
standing
upon
a
table
of
alabaster
a
black
gipsey
with
a
head
hands
and
feet
of
brass
and
the
famous
hermaphrodite
which
vies
with
that
of
florence
though
the
most
curious
circumstance
of
this
article
is
the
mattrass
executed
and
placed
by
bernini
with
such
art
and
dexterity
that
to
the
view
it
rivals
the
softness
of
wool
and
seems
to
retain
the
marks
of
pressure
according
to
the
figure
of
the
superincumbent
statue
let
us
likewise
own
for
the
honour
of
the
moderns
that
the
same
artist
has
produced
two
fine
statues
which
we
find
among
the
ornaments
of
this
villa
namely
a
david
with
his
sling
in
the
attitude
of
throwing
the
stone
at
the
giant
goliah
and
a
daphne
changing
into
laurel
at
the
approach
of
apollo
on
the
base
of
this
figure
are
the
two
following
elegant
lines
written
by
pope
urban
viii
in
his
younger
years
quisquis
amans
sequitur
fugitivae
gaudia
formae
fronde
manus
implet
baccas
vel
carpit
amaras
who
pants
for
fleeting
beauty
vain
pursuit
shall
barren
leaves
obtain
or
bitter
fruit
i
ought
not
to
forget
two
exquisite
antique
statues
of
venus
the
weeping
slave
and
the
youth
pulling
a
thorn
out
of
his
foot
i
do
not
pretend
to
give
a
methodical
detail
of
the
curiosities
of
rome
they
have
been
already
described
by
different
authors
who
were
much
better
qualified
than
i
am
for
the
talk
but
you
shall
have
what
observations
i
made
on
the
most
remarkable
objects
without
method
just
as
they
occur
to
my
remembrance
and
i
protest
the
remarks
are
all
my
own
so
that
if
they
deserve
any
commendation
i
claim
all
the
merit
and
if
they
are
impertinent
i
must
be
contented
to
bear
all
the
blame
the
piazza
of
peter
church
is
altogether
sublime
the
double
colonnade
on
each
side
extending
in
a
sweep
the
stupendous
aegyptian
obelisk
the
two
fountains
the
portico
and
the
admirable
facade
of
the
church
form
such
an
assemblage
of
magnificent
objects
as
can
not
fail
to
impress
the
mind
with
awe
and
admiration
but
the
church
would
have
produced
a
still
greater
effect
had
it
been
detached
entirely
from
the
buildings
of
the
vatican
it
would
then
have
been
a
of
architecture
complete
in
all
its
parts
intire
and
perfect
whereas
at
present
it
is
no
more
than
a
beautiful
member
attached
to
a
vast
undigested
and
irregular
pile
of
building
as
to
the
architecture
of
this
famous
temple
i
shall
say
nothing
neither
do
i
pretend
to
describe
the
internal
ornaments
the
great
picture
of
mosaic
work
and
that
of
peter
bark
tossed
by
the
tempest
which
appear
over
the
gate
of
the
church
though
rude
in
comparison
with
modern
pieces
are
nevertheless
great
curiosities
when
considered
as
the
work
of
giotto
who
flourished
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
his
master
was
cimabue
who
learned
painting
and
architecture
of
the
grecian
artists
who
came
from
constantinople
and
first
revived
these
arts
in
italy
but
to
return
to
peter
i
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
famous
statue
of
the
dead
christ
in
his
mother
lap
by
michael
angelo
the
figure
of
christ
is
as
much
emaciated
as
if
he
had
died
of
a
consumption
besides
there
is
something
indelicate
not
to
say
indecent
in
the
attitude
and
design
of
a
man
body
stark
naked
lying
upon
the
knees
of
a
woman
here
are
some
good
pictures
i
should
rather
say
copies
of
good
pictures
done
in
mosaic
to
great
perfection
particularly
a
sebastian
by
domenichino
and
michael
the
archangel
from
a
painting
of
guido
rheni
i
am
extremely
fond
of
all
this
artist
pieces
there
is
a
tenderness
and
delicacy
in
his
manner
and
his
figures
are
all
exquisitely
beautiful
though
his
expression
is
often
erroneous
and
his
attitudes
are
always
affected
and
unnatural
in
this
very
piece
the
archangel
has
all
the
air
of
a
french
and
i
have
seen
a
madonna
by
the
same
hand
i
think
it
is
in
the
palazzo
di
barberini
in
which
though
the
figures
are
enchanting
the
virgin
is
represented
holding
up
the
drapery
of
the
infant
with
the
ridiculous
affectation
of
a
singer
on
the
stage
of
our
italian
opera
the
mosaic
work
though
brought
to
a
wonderful
degree
of
improvement
and
admirably
calculated
for
churches
the
dampness
of
which
is
pernicious
to
the
colours
of
the
pallet
i
will
not
yet
compare
to
the
productions
of
the
pencil
the
glassyness
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
of
the
surface
throws
in
my
opinion
a
false
light
on
some
parts
of
the
picture
and
when
you
approach
it
the
joinings
of
the
pieces
look
like
so
many
cracks
on
painted
canvas
besides
this
method
is
extremely
tedious
and
expensive
i
went
to
see
the
artists
at
work
in
a
house
that
stands
near
the
church
where
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
ingenuity
of
the
process
and
not
a
little
surprized
at
the
great
number
of
different
colours
and
tints
which
are
kept
in
separate
drawers
marked
with
numbers
as
far
as
seventeen
thousand
for
a
single
head
done
in
mosaic
they
asked
me
fifty
zequines
but
to
return
to
the
church
the
altar
of
peter
choir
notwithstanding
all
the
ornaments
which
have
been
lavished
upon
it
is
no
more
than
a
heap
of
puerile
finery
better
adapted
to
an
indian
pagod
than
to
a
temple
built
upon
the
principles
of
the
greek
architecture
the
four
colossal
figures
that
support
the
chair
are
both
clumsy
and
disproportioned
the
drapery
of
statues
whether
in
brass
or
stone
when
thrown
into
large
masses
appears
hard
and
unpleasant
to
the
eye
and
for
that
reason
the
antients
always
imitated
wet
linen
which
exhibiting
the
shape
of
the
limbs
underneath
and
hanging
in
a
multiplicity
of
wet
folds
gives
an
air
of
lightness
softness
and
ductility
to
the
whole
these
two
statues
weigh
pounds
and
as
they
sustain
nothing
but
a
chair
are
out
of
all
proportion
inasmuch
as
the
supporters
ought
to
be
suitable
to
the
things
supported
here
are
four
giants
holding
up
the
old
wooden
chair
of
the
apostle
peter
if
we
may
believe
the
book
de
identitate
cathedrae
romanae
of
the
identity
of
the
roman
chair
the
implements
of
popish
superstition
such
as
relicks
of
pretended
saints
spires
and
bellfreys
and
the
nauseous
repetition
of
the
figure
of
the
cross
which
is
in
itself
a
very
mean
and
disagreeable
object
only
fit
for
the
prisons
of
condemned
criminals
have
contributed
to
introduce
a
vitious
taste
into
the
external
architecture
as
well
as
in
the
internal
ornaments
of
our
temples
all
churches
are
built
in
the
figure
of
a
cross
which
effectually
prevents
the
eye
from
taking
in
the
scope
of
the
building
either
without
side
or
within
consequently
robs
the
edifice
of
its
proper
effect
the
palace
of
the
escurial
in
spain
is
laid
out
in
the
shape
of
a
gridiron
because
the
convent
was
built
in
consequence
of
a
vow
to
laurence
who
was
broiled
like
a
barbecued
pig
what
pity
it
is
that
the
labours
of
painting
should
have
been
so
much
employed
on
the
shocking
subjects
of
the
martyrology
besides
numberless
pictures
of
the
flagellation
crucifixion
and
descent
from
the
cross

and
encourage
a
spirit
of
religious
fanaticism
which
has
always
been
attended
with
mischievous
consequences
to
the
community
where
it
reigned
the
tribune
of
the
great
altar
consisting
of
four
wreathed
brass
pillars
gilt
supporting
a
canopy
is
doubtless
very
magnificent
if
not
with
sculpture
fluting
foliage
festoons
and
figures
of
boys
and
angels
which
with
the
hundred
and
lamps
of
silver
continually
burning

serve
rather
to
dazzle
the
eyes
and
kindle
the
devotion
of
the
ignorant
vulgar
than
to
excite
the
admiration
of
a
judicious
observer
there
is
nothing
i
believe
in
this
famous
structure
so
worthy
of
applause
as
the
admirable
symmetry
and
proportion
of
its
parts
notwithstanding
all
the
carving
gilding
basso
relievos
medallions
urns
statues
columns
and
pictures
with
which
it
abounds
it
does
not
on
the
whole
appear
with
ornaments
when
you
first
enter
your
eye
is
filled
so
equally
and
regularly
that
nothing
appears
stupendous
and
the
church
seems
considerably
smaller
than
it
really
is
the
statues
of
children
that
support
the
founts
of
holy
water
when
observed
from
the
door
seem
to
be
of
the
natural
size
but
as
you
draw
near
you
perceive
they
are
gigantic
in
the
same
manner
the
figures
of
the
doves
with
olive
branches
in
their
beaks
which
are
represented
on
the
wall
appear
to
be
within
your
reach
but
as
you
approach
them
they
recede
to
a
considerable
height
as
if
they
had
flown
upwards
to
avoid
being
taken
i
was
much
disappointed
at
sight
of
the
pantheon
which
after
all
that
has
been
said
of
it
looks
like
a
huge
cockpit
open
at
top
the
portico
which
agrippa
added
to
the
building
is
undoubtedly
very
noble
though
in
my
opinion
it
corresponds
but
ill
with
the
simplicity
of
the
edifice
with
all
my
veneration
for
the
antients
i
can
not
see
in
what
the
beauty
of
the
rotunda
consists
it
is
no
more
than
a
plain
unpierced
cylinder
or
circular
wall
with
two
fillets
and
a
cornice
having
a
vaulted
roof
or
cupola
open
in
the
centre
i
mean
the
original
building
without
considering
the
vestibule
of
agrippa
within
side
it
has
much
the
air
of
a
mausoleum
it
was
this
appearance
which
in
all
probability
suggested
the
thought
to
boniface
iv
to
transport
hither
eight
and
twenty
of
old
rotten
bones
dug
from
different
and
then
dedicate
it
as
a
church
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
all
the
holy
martyrs
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
think
it
is
well
lighted
by
the
hole
at
the
top
which
is
about
nine
and
twenty
feet
in
diameter
although
the
author
of
the
grand
tour
calls
it
but
nine
the
same
author
says
there
is
a
descent
of
eleven
steps
to
go
into
it
that
it
is
a
hundred
and
feet
in
heighth
and
as
many
in
breadth
that
it
was
covered
with
copper
which
with
the
brass
nails
of
the
portico
pope
urban
viii
took
away
and
converted
into
the
four
wreathed
pillars
that
support
the
canopy
of
the
high
altar
in
the
church
of
peter
the
truth
is
before
the
time
of
pope
alexander
vii
the
earth
was
so
raised
as
to
cover
part
of
the
temple
and
there
was
a
descent
of
some
steps
into
the
porch
but
that
pontiff
ordered
the
ground
to
be
pared
away
to
the
very
pedestal
or
base
of
the
portico
which
is
now
even
with
the
street
so
that
there
is
no
descent
whatsoever
the
height
is
two
hundred
palmi
and
the
breadth
two
hundred
and
eighteen
which
reckoning
fife
palmi
at
nine
inches
will
bring
the
height
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
breadth
to
one
hundred
and
feet
six
inches
it
was
not
any
covering
of
copper
which
pope
urban
viii
removed
but
large
brass
beams
which
supported
the
roof
of
the
portico
they
weighed
pounds
and
afforded
metal
enough
not
only
for
the
pillars
in
peter
church
but
also
for
several
pieces
of
artillery
that
are
now
in
the
castle
of
angelo
what
is
more
extraordinary
the
gilding
of
those
columns
is
said
to
have
cost
forty
thousand
golden
crowns
sure
money
was
never
worse
laid
out
urban
viii
likewise
added
two
bellfrey
towers
to
the
rotunda
and
i
wonder
he
did
not
cover
the
central
hole
with
glass
as
it
must
be
very
inconvenient
and
disagreeable
to
those
who
go
to
church
below
to
be
exposed
to
the
rain
in
wet
weather
which
must
also
render
it
very
damp
and
unwholesome
i
visited
it
several
times
and
each
time
it
looked
more
and
more
gloomy
and
sepulchral
the
magnificence
of
the
romans
was
not
so
conspicuous
in
their
temples
as
in
their
theatres
amphitheatres
circusses
naumachia
aqueducts
triumphal
arches
porticoes
basilicae
but
especially
their
thermae
or
a
great
number
of
their
temples
were
small
and
inconsiderable
not
one
of
them
was
comparable
either
for
size
or
magnificence
to
the
modern
church
of
peter
of
the
vatican
the
famous
temple
of
jupiter
capitolinus
was
neither
half
so
long
nor
half
so
broad
it
was
but
two
hundred
feet
in
length
and
one
hundred
and
in
breadth
whereas
the
length
of
peter
extends
to
six
hundred
and
feet
and
the
breadth
to
above
five
hundred
it
is
very
near
twice
as
large
as
the
temple
of
jupiter
olympius
in
greece
which
was
counted
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
but
i
shall
take
another
opportunity
to
explain
myself
further
on
the
antiquities
of
this
city
a
subject
upon
which
i
am
disposed
to
be
perhaps
impertinently
circumstantial
when
i
begin
to
run
riot
you
should
cheek
me
with
the
freedom
of
a
friend
the
most
distant
hint
will
be
sufficient
to
dear
sir
yours

nice

dear
sir
the
colossaeum
or
amphitheatre
built
by
flavius
vespasian
is
the
most
stupendous
work
of
the
kind
which
antiquity
can
produce
near
one
half
of
the
external
circuit
still
remains
consisting
of
four
tire
of
arcades
adorned
with
columns
of
four
orders
doric
ionic
corinthian
and
composite
the
height
and
extent
of
it
may
be
guessed
from
the
number
of
spectators
it
contained
amounting
to
one
hundred
thousand
and
yet
according
to
fontana
mensuration
it
could
not
contain
above
thousand
persons
sitting
allowing
a
foot
and
an
half
for
each
person
for
the
circuit
of
the
whole
building
did
not
exceed
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
sixty
feet
the
amphitheatre
at
verona
is
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
feet
in
circumference
and
that
of
nismes
one
thousand
and
eighty
the
colossaeum
was
built
by
vespasian
who
employed
thirty
thousand
jewish
slaves
in
the
work
but
finished
and
dedicated
by
his
son
titus
who
on
the
first
day
of
its
being
opened
produced
fifty
thousand
wild
beasts
which
were
all
killed
in
the
arena
the
romans
were
undoubtedly
a
barbarous
people
who
delighted
in
horrible
spectacles
they
viewed
with
pleasure
the
dead
bodies
of
criminals
dragged
through
the
streets
or
thrown
down
the
scalae
gemoniae
and
tarpeian
rock
for
their
contemplation
their
rostra
were
generally
adorned
with
the
heads
of
some
remarkable
citizens
like
at
london
they
even
bore
the
sight
of
tully
head
fixed
upon
that
very
rostrum
where
he
had
so
often
ravished
their
ears
with
all
the
charms
of
eloquence
in
pleading
the
cause
of
innocence
and
public
virtue
they
took
delight
in
seeing
their
torn
in
pieces
by
wild
beasts
in
the
amphitheatre
they
shouted
with
applause
when
they
saw
a
poor
dwarf
or
slave
killed
by
his
adversary
but
their
transports
were
altogether
extravagant
when
the
devoted
captives
were
obliged
to
fight
in
troops
till
one
side
was
entirely
butchered
by
the
other
nero
produced
four
hundred
senators
and
six
hundred
of
the
equestrian
order
as
gladiators
in
the
public
arena
even
the
women
fought
with
wild
beasts
as
well
as
with
each
other
and
drenched
the
amphitheatres
with
their
blood
tacitus
says
sed
faeminarum
illustrium
senatorumque
filiorum
plures
per
arenam
faedati
sunt
but
many
sons
of
senators
and
even
matrons
of
the
first
rank
exposed
themselves
in
this
vile
exercise
the
execrable
custom
of
sacrificing
captives
or
slaves
at
the
tombs
of
their
masters
and
great
men
which
is
still
preserved
among
the
negroes
of
africa
obtained
also
among
the
antients
greeks
as
well
as
romans
i
could
never
without
horror
and
indignation
read
that
passage
in
the
book
of
the
iliad
which
describes
twelve
valiant
trojan
captives
sacrificed
by
the
inhuman
achilles

the

even
virgil
makes
his
pious
hero
sacrifice
eight
italian
youths
to
the
manes
of
pallas
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
a
people
is
the
more
brave
the
more
they
are
accustomed
to
bloodshed
in
their
public
entertainments
true
bravery
is
not
savage
but
humane
some
of
this
sanguinary
spirit
is
inherited
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
certain
island
that
shall
be
nameless
but
mum
for
that
you
will
naturally
suppose
that
the
coliseo
was
ruined
by
the
barbarians
who
sacked
the
city
of
rome
in
effect
they
robbed
it
of
its
ornaments
and
valuable
materials
but
it
was
reserved
for
the
goths
and
vandals
of
modern
rome
to
dismantle
the
edifice
and
reduce
it
to
its
present
ruinous
condition
one
part
of
it
was
demolished
by
pope
paul
ii
that
he
might
employ
the
stones
of
it
in
building
the
palace
of
mark
it
was
afterwards
dilapidated
for
the
same
purposes
by
the
cardinals
riarius
and
farnese
which
last
assumed
the
tiara
under
the
name
of
paul
iii
notwithstanding
these
injuries
there
is
enough
standing
to
convey
a
very
sublime
idea
of
ancient
magnificence
the
circi
and
naumachia
if
considered
as
buildings
and
artificial
basins
are
admirable
but
if
examined
as
areae
intended
for
horse
and
chariot
races
and
artificial
seas
for
exhibiting
naval
engagements
they
seem
to
prove
that
the
antient
romans
were
but
indifferently
skilled
and
exercised
either
in
horsemanship
or
naval
armaments
the
inclosure
of
the
emperor
caracalla
circus
is
still
standing
and
scarce
affords
breathing
room
for
an
english
hunter
the
circus
maximus
by
far
the
largest
in
rome
was
not
so
long
as
the
mall
and
i
will
venture
to
affirm
that
james
park
would
make
a
much
more
ample
and
convenient
scene
for
those
diversions
i
imagine
an
old
roman
would
be
very
much
surprised
to
see
an
english
race
on
the
course
at
the
circus
maximus
was
but
three
hundred
yards
in
breadth
a
good
part
of
this
was
taken
up
by
the
spina
or
middle
space
adorned
with
temples
statues
and
two
great
obelisks
as
well
as
by
the
euripus
or
canal
made
by
order
of
julius
caesar
to
contain
crocodiles
and
other
aquatic
animals
which
were
killed
occasionally
this
was
so
large
that
heliogabalus
having
filled
it
with
excellent
wine
exhibited
naval
engagements
in
it
for
the
amusement
of
the
people
it
surrounded
three
sides
of
the
square
so
that
the
whole
extent
of
the
race
did
not
much
exceed
an
english
mile
and
when
probus
was
at
the
expence
of
filling
the
plain
of
it
with
to
form
a
wood
for
the
chace
of
wild
beasts
i
question
much
if
this
forest
was
more
extensive
than
the
plantation
in
james
park
on
the
south
side
of
the
canal
now
i
leave
you
to
judge
what
ridicule
a
king
of
england
would
incur
by
converting
this
part
of
the
park
into
a
chace
for
any
species
of
animals
which
are
counted
game
in
our
country
the
roman
emperors
seemed
more
disposed
to
elevate
and
surprize
than
to
conduct
the
public
diversions
according
to
the
rules
of
reason
and
propriety
one
would
imagine
it
was
with
this
view
they
instituted
their
naumachia
or
naval
engagements
performed
by
half
a
dozen
small
gallies
of
a
side
in
an
artificial
basin
of
fresh
water
these
gallies
i
suppose
were
not
so
large
as
common
for
they
were
moved
by
two
three
and
four
oars
of
a
side
according
to
their
different
rates
biremes
triremes
and
quadriremes
i
know
this
is
a
knotty
point
not
yet
determined
and
that
some
antiquarians
believe
the
roman
gallies
had
different
tires
or
decks
of
oars
but
this
is
a
notion
very
ill
supported
and
quite
contrary
to
all
the
figures
of
them
that
are
preserved
on
antient
coins
and
medals
suetonius
in
the
reign
of
domitian
speaking
of
these
naumachia
says
edidit
navales
pugnas
pene
justarum
classium
effosso
et
circumducto
juxta
tyberim
lacu
atque
inter
maximas
imbres
prospectavit
he
exhibited
naval
engagements
of
almost
intire
fleets
in
an
artificial
lake
formed
for
the
purpose
hard
by
the
tyber
and
viewed
them
in
the
midst
of
excessive
rains
this
artificial
lake
was
not
larger
than
the
piece
of
water
in
and
yet
the
historian
says
it
was
almost
large
enough
for
real
or
intire
fleets
how
would
a
british
sailor
relish
an
advertisement
that
a
mock
engagement
between
two
squadrons
of
men
of
war
would
be
exhibited
on
such
a
day
in
the
serpentine
river
or
that
the
ships
of
the
line
taken
from
the
enemy
would
be
carried
in
procession
from
to
certain
it
is
lucullus
in
one
of
his
triumphs
had
one
hundred
and
ten
ships
of
war
naves
longas
carried
through
the
streets
of
rome
nothing
can
give
a
more
contemptible
idea
of
their
naval
power
than
this
testimony
of
their
historians
who
declare
that
their
seamen
or
mariners
were
formed
by
exercising
small
in
an
inclosed
pool
of
fresh
water
had
they
not
the
sea
within
a
few
miles
of
them
and
the
river
tyber
running
through
their
capital
even
this
would
have
been
much
more
proper
for
exercising
their
watermen
than
a
pond
of
not
much
larger
than
a
i
do
believe
in
my
conscience
that
half
a
dozen
english
frigates
would
have
been
able
to
defeat
both
the
contending
fleets
at
the
famous
battle
of
actium
which
has
been
so
much
celebrated
in
the
annals
of
antiquity
as
an
event
that
decided
the
fate
of
empire
it
would
employ
me
a
whole
month
to
describe
the
thermae
or
baths
the
vast
ruins
of
which
are
still
to
be
seen
within
the
walls
of
rome
like
the
remains
of
so
many
separate
citadels
the
thermae
dioclesianae
might
be
termed
an
august
academy
for
the
use
and
instruction
of
the
roman
people
the
pinacotheca
of
this
building
was
a
complete
musaeum
of
all
the
curiosities
of
art
and
nature
and
there
were
public
schools
for
all
the
sciences
if
i
may
judge
by
my
eye
however
the
thermae
antonianae
built
by
caracalla
were
still
more
extensive
and
magnificent
they
contained
cells
sufficient
for
two
thousand
three
hundred
persons
to
bathe
at
one
time
without
being
seen
by
one
another
they
were
adorned
with
all
the
charms
of
painting
architecture
and
sculpture
the
pipes
for
convoying
the
water
were
of
silver
many
of
the
lavacra
were
of
precious
marble
illuminated
by
lamps
of
chrystal
among
the
statues
were
found
the
famous
toro
and
hercole
farnese
bathing
was
certainly
necessary
to
health
and
cleanliness
in
a
hot
country
like
italy
especially
before
the
use
of
linen
was
known
but
these
purposes
would
have
been
much
better
answered
by
plunging
into
the
tyber
than
by
using
the
warm
bath
in
the
thermae
which
became
altogether
a
point
of
luxury
borrowed
from
the
effeminate
asiatics
and

in

though
there
was
no

in

used
their
own
silver
and
gold
plate
for
washing
eating
and
drinking
in
the
bath
together
with
towels
of
the
finest
linen
they
likewise
made

called

was

were

for

and
indeed
there
were

opened
for
the
use
of
women
only
at
the
expence
of
agrippina
the
mother
of
nero
and
some
other
matrons
of
the
first
quality
the
use
of
bathing
was
become
so
habitual
to
the
constitutions
of
the
romans
that
galen
in
his
book
de
sanitate
tuenda
mentions
a
certain
philosopher
who
if
he
intermitted
but
one
day
in
his
bathing
was
certainly
attacked
with
a
fever
in
order
to
preserve
decorum
in
the
baths
a
set
of
laws
and
regulations
were
published
and
the
thermae
were
put
under
the
inspection
of
a
censor
who
was
generally
one
of
the
first
senators
in
rome
agrippa
left
his
gardens
and
baths
which
stood
near
the
pantheon
to
the
roman
people
among
the
statues
that
adorned
them
was
that
of
a
youth
naked
as
going
into
the
bath
so
elegantly
formed
by
the
hand
of
lysippus
that
tiberius
being
struck
with
the
beauty
of
it
ordered
it
to
be
transferred
into
his
own
palace
but
the
populace
raised
such
a
clamour
against
him
that
he
was
fain
to
have
it
reconveyed
to
its
former
place
these
noble
baths
were
restored
by
adrian
as
we
read
in
spartian
but
at
present
no
part
of
them
remains
with
respect
to
the
present
state
of
the
old
aqueducts
i
can
give
you
very
little
satisfaction
i
only
saw
the
ruins
of
that
which
conveyed
the
aqua
claudia
near
the
porta
maggiore
and
the
piazza
of
the
lateran
you
know
there
were
fourteen
of
those
antient
aqueducts
some
of
which
brought
water
to
rome
from
the
distance
of
forty
miles
the
channels
of
them
were
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
armed
on
horseback
and
therefore
when
rome
was
besieged
by
the
goths
who
had
cut
off
the
water
belisarius
fortified
them
with
works
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
entering
the
city
by
those
conveyances
after
that
period
i
suppose
the
antient
aqueducts
continued
dry
and
were
suffered
to
run
to
ruins
without
all
doubt
the
romans
were
greatly
obliged
to
those
benefactors
who
raised
such
stupendous
works
for
the
benefit
as
well
as
the
embellishment
of
their
city
but
it
might
have
been
supplied
with
the
same
water
through
pipes
at
one
hundredth
part
of
the
expence
and
in
that
case
the
enemy
would
not
have
found
it
such
an
easy
matter
to
cut
it
off
those
popes
who
have
provided
the
modern
city
so
plentifully
with
excellent
water
are
much
to
be
commended
for
the
care
and
expence
they
have
bestowed
in
restoring
the
streams
called
acqua
virgine
acqua
felice
and
acqua
paolina
which
afford
such
abundance
of
water
as
would
plentifully
supply
a
much
larger
city
than
modern
rome
it
is
no
wonder
that
agrippa
the
friend
and
favourite
of
augustus
should
at
the
same
time
have
been
the
idol
of
the
people
considering
how
surprisingly
he
exerted
himself
for
the
emolument
convenience
and
pleasure
of
his
it
was
he
who
first
conducted
this
acqua
virgine
to
rome
he
formed
seven
hundred
reservoirs
in
the
city
erected
one
hundred
and
five
fountains
one
hundred
and
thirty
castella
or
conduits
which
works
he
adorned
with
three
hundred
statues
and
four
hundred
pillars
of
marble
in
the
space
of
one
year
he
also
brought
into
rome
the
aqua
julia
and
restored
the
aqueduct
of
the
aqua
marzia
which
had
fallen
to
decay
i
have
already
observed
the
great
number
of
baths
which
he
opened
for
the
people
and
the
magnificent
thermae
with
spacious
gardens
which
he
bequeathed
to
them
as
a
legacy
but
these
benefactions
great
and
munificent
as
they
seem
to
be
were
not
the
most
important
services
he
performed
for
the
city
of
rome
the
were
first
made
by
order
of
tarquinius
priscus
not
so
much
with
a
view
to
cleanliness
as
by
way
of
subterranean
drains
to
the
velabrum
and
in
order
to
carry
off
the
stagnant
water
which
remained
in
the
lower
parts
after
heavy
rains
the
different
branches
of
these
channels
united
at
the
forum
from
whence
by
the
cloaca
maxima
their
contents
were
conveyed
into
the
tyber
this
great
cloaca
was
the
work
of
tarquinius
superbus
other
sewers
were
added
by
marcus
cato
and
valerius
flaccus
the
censors
all
these
drains
having
been
choaked
up
and
ruinous
were
cleared
and
restored
by
marcus
agrippa
who
likewise
undermined
the
whole
city
with
canals
of
the
same
kind
for
carrying
of
the
filth
he
strengthened
and
enlarged
the
cloaca
maxima
so
as
to
make
it
capable
of
receiving
a
large
cart
loaded
with
hay
and
directed
seven
streams
of
water
into
these
subterranean
passages
in
order
to
keep
them
always
clean
and
open
if
notwithstanding
all
these
conveniences
vespasian
was
put
to
great
expence
in
removing
the
ordure
from
the
public
streets
we
have
certainly
a
right
to
conclude
that
the
antient
romans
were
not
more
cleanly
than
the
modern
italians
after
the
mausolea
of
augustus
and
adrian
which
i
have
already
mentioned
the
most
remarkable
antient
sepulchres
at
rome
are
those
of
caius
cestius
and
cecilia
metella
the
first
which
stands
by
the
porta
di
paolo
is
a
beautiful
pyramid
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
high
still
preserved
intire
having
a
vaulted
chamber
adorned
with
some
ancient
painting
which
is
now
almost
effaced
the
building
is
of
brick
but
eased
with
marble
this
caius
cestius
had
been
consul
was
very
rich
and
acted
as
one
of
the
seven
epulones
who
superintended
the
feasts
of
the
gods
called
lectisternia
and
pervigilia
he
bequeathed
his
whole
fortune
to
his
friend
agrippa
who
was
so
generous
as
to
give
it
up
to
the
relations
of
the
testator
the
monument
of
cecilia
metella
commonly
called
capo
di
bove
is
without
the
walls
on
the
via
appia
this
lady
was
daughter
of
metellus
creticus
and
wife
to
crassus
who
erected
this
noble
monument
to
her
memory
it
consisted
of
two
orders
or
stories
the
first
of
which
was
a
square
of
hewn
stone
the
second
was
a
circular
tower
having
a
cornice
adorned
with
ox
heads
in
basso
relievo
a
circumstance
from
which
it
takes
the
name
of
capo
di
bove
the
ox
was
supposed
to
be
a
most
grateful
sacrifice
to
the
gods
pliny
speaking
of
bulls
and
oxen
says
hinc
victimae
optimae
et
laudatissima
deorum
placatio
they
were
accounted
the
best
victims
and
most
agreeable
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
gods
this
tower
was
surmounted
by
a
noble
cupola
or
dome
enriched
with
all
the
ornaments
of
architecture
the
door
of
the
building
was
of
brass
and
the
ashes
of
cecilia
were
deposited
in
a
fluted
marble
urn
of
curious
workmanship
which
is
still
kept
in
the
palazzo
farnese
at
present
the
surface
of
the
ground
is
raised
so
much
as
to
cover
the
first
order
of
the
edifice
what
we
see
is
no
more
than
the
round
tower
without
the
dome
and
its
ornaments
and
the
following
inscription
still
remains
near
the
top
facing

letter
xxxiii
nice
march
dear
sir
you
must
not
imagine
i
saw
one
half
of
the
valuable
pictures
and
statues
of
rome
there
is
such
a
vast
number
of
both
in
this
capital
that
i
might
have
spent
a
whole
year
in
taking
even
a
transient
view
of
them
and
after
all
some
of
them
would
have
been
overlooked
the
most
celebrated
pieces
however
i
have
seen
and
therefore
my
curiosity
is
satisfied
perhaps
if
i
had
the
nice
discernment
and
delicate
sensibility
of
a
true
connoisseur
this
superficial
glimpse
would
have
served
only
to
whet
my
appetite
and
to
detain
me
the
whole
winter
at
rome
in
my
progress
through
the
vatican
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
school
of
athens
by
raphael
a
piece
which
hath
suffered
from
the
dampness
of
the
air
the
four
boys
attending
to
the
demonstration
of
the
mathematician
are
admirably
varied
in
the
expression
webb
criticism
on
this
artist
is
certainly
just
he
was
perhaps
the
best
ethic
painter
that
ever
the
world
produced
no
man
ever
expressed
the
sentiments
so
happily
in
visage
attitude
and
gesture
but
he
seems
to
have
had
too
much
phlegm
to
strike
off
the
grand
passions
or
reach
the
sublime
parts
of
painting
he
has
the
serenity
of
virgil
but
wants
the
fire
of
homer
there
is
nothing
in
his
parnassus
which
struck
me
but
the
ludicrous
impropriety
of
apollo
playing
upon
a
fiddle
for
the
entertainment
of
the
nine
muses
upon
better
information
i
must
retract
this
censure
in
as
much
as
i
find
there
was
really
a
musical
instrument
among
the
antients
of
this
figure
as
appears
by
a
small
statue
in
bronze
to
be
still
seen
in
the
florentine
collection
the
last
judgment
by
buonaroti
in
the
chapel
of
sixtus
iv
produced
to
my
eye
the
same
sort
of
confusion
that
perplexes
my
ear
at
a
grand
concert
consisting
of
a
great
variety
of
instruments
or
rather
when
a
number
of
people
are
talking
all
at
once
i
was
pleased
with
the
strength
of
expression
exhibited
in
single
figures
and
separate
groupes
but
the
whole
together
is
a
mere
mob
without
subordination
keeping
or
repose
a
painter
ought
to
avoid
all
subjects
that
require
a
multiplicity
of
groupes
and
figures
because
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
that

unite
a
great

to

michael

with
all
his
skill
in

his

his

his

to
have
had
very
little
idea

one
would
imagine
he
had
chosen
his

cardinals
and

from
among
the

that
he
really
drew
his
jesus
on
the
cross
from
the
agonies
of
some
vulgar
assassin
expiring
on

that
the

of

their

were
literally
found
in
a
stable
in
the

from
whence
the
sistian

is

we
see
among
other
exploits
of
catholic
heroes
a
representation
of
the
massacre
of
the
protestants
in
paris
tholouse
and
other
parts
of

on

thus
the
court
of

hath
employed
their
artists
to
celebrate
and
perpetuate
as
a
meritorious
action
the
most
perfidious
cruel
and
infamous
massacre
that
ever
disgraced
the
annals
of
any
nation
i
need
not
mention
the
two
equestrian
statues
of
constantine
the
great
and
charlemagne
which
stand
at
opposite
ends
of
the
great
portico
of
peter
church
because
there
is
nothing
in
them
which
particularly
engaged
my
attention
the
sleeping
cleopatra
as
you
enter
the
court
of
the
belvedere
in
the
vatican
is
much
admired
but
i
was
better
pleased
with
the
apollo
which
i
take
to
be
the
most
beautiful
statue
that
ever
was
formed
the
nile
which
lies
in
the
open
court
surmounted
with
the
little
children
has
infinite
merit
but
is
much
damaged
and
altogether
neglected
whether
it
is
the
same
described
in
pliny
as
having
been
placed
by
vespasian
in
the
temple
of
peace
i
do
not
know
the
sixteen
children
playing
about
it
denoted
the
swelling
of
the
nile
which
never
rose
above
sixteen
cubits
as
for
the
famous
groupe
of
laocoon
it
surpassed
my
expectation
it
was
not
without
reason
that
buonaroti
called
it
a
portentous
work
and
pliny
has
done
it
no
more
than
justice
in
saying
it
is
the
most
excellent
piece
that
ever
was
cut
in
marble
and
yet
the
famous
fulvius
ursini
is
of
opinion
that
this
is
not
the
same
statue
which
pliny
described
his
reasons
mentioned
by
montfaucon
are
these
the
statues
described
by
pliny
were
of
one
stone
but
these
are
not
antonioli
the
antiquary
has
in
his
possession
pieces
of
laocoon
snakes
which
were
found
in
the
ground
where
the
baths
of
titus
actually
stood
agreeable
to
pliny
who
says
these
statues
were
placed
in
the
buildings
of
titus
be
that
as
it
may
the
work
which
we
now
see
does
honour
to
antiquity
as
you
have
seen
innumerable
copies
and
casts
of
it
in
marble
plaister
copper
lead
drawings
and
prints
and
read
the
description
of
it
in
keysler
and
twenty
other
books
of
travels
i
shall
say
nothing
more
on
the
subject
but
that
neither
they
nor
i
nor
any
other
person
could
say
too
much
in
its
praise
it
is
not
of
one
piece
indeed
in
that
particular
pliny
himself
might
be
mistaken

and
was
found
in
the

of

still
supposing

to
be
the
true
antique
as
for
the
torso
or
mutilated
trunk
of
a
statue
which
is
called
the
school
of
michael
angelo
i
had
not
time
to
consider
it
attentively
nor
taste
enough
to
perceive
its
beauties
at
first
sight
the
famous
horses
on
monte
cavallo
before
the
palace
which
are
said
to
have
been
made
in
emulation
by
phidias
and
praxiteles
i
have
seen
and
likewise
those
in
the
front
of
the
capitol
with
the
statues
of
castor
and
pollux
but
what
pleased
me
infinitely
more
than
all
of
them
together
is
the
equestrian
statue
of
corinthian
brass
standing
in
the
middle
of
this
piazza
i
mean
at
the
capitol
said
to
represent
the
emperor
marcus
aurelius
others
suppose
it
was
intended
for
lucius
verus
a
third
set
of
antiquaries
contend
for
lucius
septimius
severus
and
a
fourth
for
constantine
because
it
stood
in
the
piazza
of
the
lateran
palace
built
by
that
emperor
from
whence
pope
paul
iii
caused
it
to
be
removed
to
the
capitol
i
considered
the
trophy
of
marius
as
a
very
curious
piece
of
sculpture
and
admired
the
two
sphinxes
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
leading
to
this
piazza
as
the
only
good
specimens
of
design
i
have
ever
seen
from
aegypt
for
the
two
idols
of
that
country
which
stand
in
the
ground
floor
of
the
musaeum
of
the
capitol
and
indeed
all
the
aegyptian
statues
in
the
camera
aegyptiaca
of
this
very
building
are
such
monstrous
misrepresentations
of
nature
that
they
never
could
have
obtained
a
place
among
the
statues
of
rome
except
as
curiosities
of
foreign
superstition
or
on
account
of
the
materials
as
they
are
generally
of
basaltes
porphyry
or
oriental
granite
at
the
farther
end
of
the
court
of
this
musaeum
fronting
the
entrance
is
a
handsome
fountain
with
the
statue
of
a
reclining
on
his
urn
this
is
no
other
than
the
famous
marforio
so
called
from
its
having
been
found
in
martis
fore
it
is
remarkable
only
as
being
the
conveyance
of
the
answers
to
the
satires
which
are
found
pasted
upon
pasquin
another
mutilated
statue
standing
at
the
corner
of
a
street
the
marble
coffin
supposed
to
have
contained
the
ashes
of
alexander
severus
which
we
find
in
one
of
these
apartments
is
a
curious
antique
valuable
for
its
sculpture
in
basso
relievo
especially
for
the
figures
on
the
cover
representilig
that
emperor
and
his
mother
julia
mammea
i
was
sorry
i
had
not
time
to
consider
the
antient
plan
of
rome
disposed
in
six
classes
on
the
of
this
musaeum
which
was
brought
hither
from
a
temple
that
stood
in
the
forum
boarium
now
called
campo
vaccine
it
would
be
ridiculous
in
me
to
enter
into
a
detail
of
the
vast
collection
of
marbles
basso
relievos
inscriptions
urns
busts
and
statues
which
are
placed
in
the
upper
apartments
of
this
edifice
i
saw
them
but
once
and
then
i
was
struck
with
the
following
particulars
a
bacchanalian
drunk
a
jupiter
and
leda
at
least
equal
to
that
in
the
gallery
at
florence
an
old
praesica
or
hired
mourner
very
much
resembling
those
wrinkled
hags
still
employed
in
ireland
and
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
to
sing
the
coronach
at
funerals
in
praise
of
the
deceased
the
famous
antinous
an
elegant
figure
which
pousin
studied
as
canon
or
rule
of
symmetry
the
two
fauns
and
above
all
the
mirmillone
or
dying
gladiator
the
attitude
of
the
body
the
expression
of
the
countenance
the
elegance
of
the
limbs
and
the
swelling
of
the
muscles
in
this
statue
are
universally
admired
but
the
execution
of
the
back
is
incredibly
delicate
the
course
of
the
muscles
called
longissimi
dorsi
are
so
naturally
marked
and
tenderly
executed
that
the
marble
actually
emulates
the
softness
of
the
flesh
and
you
may
count
all
the
spines
of
the
vertebrae
raising
up
the
skin
as
in
the
living
body
yet
this
statue
with
all
its
merit
seems
inferior
to
the
celebrated
dying
gladiator
of
ctesilas
as
described
by
pliny
who
says
the
expression
of
it
was
such
as
appears
altogether
incredible
in
the
court
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
capitol
there
is
an
admirable
statue
of
a
lion
devouring
an
horse
which
was
found
by
the
gate
of
ostia
near
the
pyramid
of
caius
cestius
and
here
on
the
left
hand
under
a
colonade
is
what
they
call
the
columna
rostrata
erected
in
honour
of
caius
duilius
who
first
triumphed
over
the
carthaginians
by
sea
but
this
is
a
modern
pillar
with
the
old
inscription
which
is
so
defaced
as
not
to
be
legible
among
the
pictures
in
the
gallery
and
saloon
above
what
pleased
me
most
was
the
bacchus
and
ariadne
of
guido
rheni
and
the
wolf
suckling
romulus
and
remus
by
rubens
the
court
of
the
palazzo
farnese
is
surrounded
with
antique
statues
among
which
the
most
celebrated
are
the
flora
with
a
most
delicate
drapery
the
gladiator
with
a
dead
boy
over
his
shoulder
the
hercules
with
the
spoils
of
the
nemean
lion
but
that
which
the
connoisseurs
justly
esteem
above
all
the
rest
is
hercules
by
glycon
which
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
by
the
great
reputation
it
has
acquired
this
admirable
statue
having
been
found
without
the
legs
these
were
supplied
by
gulielmo
de
la
porta
so
happily
that
when
afterwards
the
original
limbs
were
discovered
michael
angelo
preferred
those
of
the
modern
artist
both
in
grace
and
proportion
and
they
have
been
retained
accordingly
in
a
little
house
or
shed
behind
the
court
is
preserved
the
wonderful
group
of
dirce
commonly
called
the
toro
farnese
which
was
brought
hither
from
the
thermae
caracallae
there
is
such
spirit
ferocity
and
indignant
resistance
expressed
in
the
bull
to
whose
horns
dirce
is
tied
by
the
hair
that
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
either
upon
canvass
or
in
stone
the
statues
of
the
two
brothers
endeavouring
to
throw
him
into
the
sea
are
beautiful
figures
finely
contrasted
and
the
rope
which
one
of
them
holds
in
a
sort
of
loose
coil
is
so
surprisingly
chizzelled
that
one
can
hardly
believe
it
is
of
stone
as
for
dirce
herself
she
seems
to
be
but
a
subaltern
character
there
is
a
dog
upon
his
hind
legs
barking
at
the
bull
which
is
much
admired
this
amazing
groupe
was
cut
out
of
one
stone
by
appollonius
and
tauriscus
two
sculptors
of
rhodes
and
is
mentioned
by
pliny
in
the
book
of
his
natural
history
all
the
precious
monuments
of
art
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
antiquity
are
the
productions
of
greek
artists
the
romans
had
taste
enough
to
admire
the
arts
of
greece
as
plainly
appears
by
the
great
collections
they
made
of
their
statues
and
pictures
as
well
as
by
adopting
their
architecture
and
musick
but
i
do
not
remember
to
have
read
of
any
roman
who
made
a
great
figure
either
as
a
painter
or
a
statuary
it
is
not
enough
to
say
those
professions
were
not
honourable
in
rome
because
painting
sculpture
and
musick
even
rhetoric
physic
and
philosophy
were
practised
and
taught
by
slaves
the
arts
were
always
honoured
and
revered
at
rome
even
when
the
professors
of
them
happened
to
be
slaves
by
the
accidents
and
iniquity
of
fortune
the
business
of
painting
and
statuary
was
so
profitable
that
in
a
free
republic
like
that
of
rome
they
must
have
been
greedily
embraced
by
a
great
number
of
individuals
but
in
all
probability
the
roman
soil
produced
no
extraordinary
genius
for
those
arts
like
the
english
of
this
day
they
made
a
figure
in
poetry
history
and
ethics
but
the
excellence
of
painting
sculpture
architecture
and
music
they
never
could
attain
in
the
palazzo
picchini
i
saw
three
beautiful
figures
the
celebrated
statues
of
meleager
the
boar
and
dog
together
with
a
wolf
of
excellent
workmanship
the
celebrated
statue
of
moses
by
michael
angelo
in
the
church
of
peter
in
vincula
i
beheld
with
pleasure
as
well
as
that
of
christ
by
the
same
hand
in
the
church
of
maria
sopra
minerva
the
right
foot
covered
with
bronze
gilt
is
much
kissed
by
the
devotees
i
suppose
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
specific
for
the
toothache
for
i
saw
a
cavalier
in
years
and
an
old
woman
successively
rub
their
gums
upon
it
with
the
appearance
of
the
most
painful
perseverance
you
need
not
doubt
but
that
i
went
to
the
church
of
peter
in
montorio
to
view
the
celebrated
transfiguration
by
raphael
which
if
it
was
mine
i
would
cut
in
two
parts
the
three
figures
in
the
air
attract
the
eye
so
strongly
that
little
or
no
attention
is
payed
to
those
below
on
the
mountain
i
apprehend
that
the
nature
of
the
subject
does
not
admit
of
that
keeping
and
dependence
which
ought
to
be
maintained
in
the
disposition
of
the
lights
and
shadows
in
a
picture
the
groupes
seem
to
be
intirely
independent
of
each
other
the
extraordinary
merit
of
this
piece
i
imagine
consists
not
only
in
the
expression
of
divinity
on
the
face
of
christ
but
also
in
the
surprising
lightness
of
the
figure
that
hovers
like
a
beautiful
exhalation
in
the
air
in
the
church
of
luke
i
was
not
at
all
struck
by
the
picture
of
that
saint
drawing
the
portrait
of
the
virgin
mary
although
it
is
admired
as
one
of
the
best
pieces
of
raphael
indeed
it
made
so
little
impression
upon
me
that
i
do
not
even
remember
the
disposition
of
the
figures
the
by
andrea
sacchi
in
the
church
of
romauldus
would
have
more
merit
if
the
figure
of
the
saint
himself
had
more
consequence
and
was
represented
in
a
stronger
light
in
the
palazzo
borghese
i
chiefly
admired
the
following
pieces
a
venus
with
two
nymphs
and
another
with
cupid
both
by
titian
an
excellent
roman
piety
by
leonardo
da
vinci
and
the
celebrated
muse
by
dominechino
which
is
a
fine
jolly
buxom
figure
at
the
palace
of
colorina
connestabile
i
was
charmed
with
the
herodias
by
guido
rheni
a
young
christ
and
a
madonna
by
raphael
and
four
landscapes
two
by
claude
lorraine
and
the
other
two
by
salvator
rosa
in
the
palazetto
or
summerhouse
belonging
to
the
palazzo
rospigliosi
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
contemplating
the
aurora
of
guido
the
colours
of
which
still
remain
in
high
perfection
notwithstanding
the
common
report
that
the
piece
is
spoiled
by
the
dampness
of
the
apartment
the
print
of
this
picture
by
freij
with
all
its
merit
conveys
but
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
beauty
of
the
original
in
the
palazzo
barberini
there
is
a
great
collection
of
marbles
and
pictures
among
the
first
i
was
attracted
by
a
beautiful
statue
of
venus
a
sleeping
faun
of
curious
workmanship
a
charming
bacchus
lying
on
an
antient
sculpture
and
the
famous
narcissus
of
the
pictures
what
gave
me
most
pleasure
was
the
magdalen
of
guido
infinitely
superior
to
that
by
le
brun
in
the
church
of
the
carmelites
at
paris
the
virgin
by
titian
a
madonna
by
raphael
but
not
comparable
to
that
which
is
in
the
palazzo
de
pitti
at
florence
and
the
death
of
germanicus
by
poussin
which
i
take
to
be
one
of
the
best
pieces
in
this
great
collection
in
the
palazzo
falconeri
there
is
a
beautiful
cecilia
by
guercino
a
holy
family
by
raphael
and
a
fine
expressive
figure
of
peter
weeping
by
dominechino
in
the
palazzo
altieri
i
admired
a
picture
by
carlo
maratti
representing
a
saint
calling
down
lightning
from
heaven
to
destroy
blasphemers
it
was
the
figure
of
the
saint
i
admired
merely
as
a
portrait
the
execution
of
the
other
parts
was
tame
enough
perhaps
they
were
purposely
kept
down
in
order
to
preserve
the
importance
of
the
principal
figure
i
imagine
salvator
rosa
would
have
made
a
different
disposition
on
the
same
subject
that
amidst
the
darkness
of
a
tempest
he
would
have
illuminated
the
blasphemer
with
the
flash
of
lightning
by
which
he
was
destroyed
this
would
have
thrown
a
dismal
gleam
upon
his
countenance
distorted
by
the
horror
of
his
situation
as
well
as
by
the
effects
of
the
fire
and
rendered
the
whole
scene
dreadfully
picturesque
in
the
same
palace
i
saw
the
famous
holy
family
by
corregio
which
he
left
unfinished
and
no
other
artist
would
undertake
to
supply
for
what
reason
i
know
not
here
too
is
a
judgment
of
paris
by
titian
which
is
reckoned
a
very
valuable
piece
in
the
palazzo
odescalchi
there
is
a
holy
family
by
buonaroti
and
another
by
raphael
both
counted
excellent
though
in
very
different
stiles
extremely
characteristic
of
those
two
great
rival
artists
if
i
was
silly
enough
to
make
a
parade
i
might
mention
some
hundreds
more
of
marbles
and
pictures
which
i
really
saw
at
rome
and
even
eke
out
that
number
with
a
huge
list
of
those
i
did
not
see
but
whatever
vanity
i
may
have
it
has
not
taken
this
turn
and
i
assure
you
upon
my
word
and
honour
i
have
described
nothing
but
what
actually
fell
under
my
own
observation
as
for
my
critical
remarks
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
them
too
superficial
and
capricious
to
belong
to
any
other
person
but
your
humble
servant
letter
xxxiv
nice
april
dear
sir
i
have
nothing
to
communicate
touching
the
library
of
the
vatican
which
with
respect
to
the
apartments
and
their
ornaments
is
undoubtedly
magnificent
the
number
of
books
it
contains
does
not
exceed
forty
thousand
volumes
which
are
all
concealed
from
the
view
and
locked
up
in
presses
as
for
the
manuscripts
i
saw
none
but
such
as
are
commonly
presented
to
strangers
of
our
nation
some
very
old
copies
of
virgil
and
terence
two
or
three
missals
curiously
illuminated
the
book
de
septem
sacramentis
written
in
latin
by
henry
viii
against
luther
and
some
of
that
prince
love
letters
to
anne
boleyn
i
likewise
visited
the
libreria
casanatense
belonging
to
the
convent
of
the
church
called
maria
sopra
minerva
i
had
a
recommendation
to
the
principal
librarian
a
dominican
friar
who
received
me
very
politely
and
regaled
me
with
a
sight
of
several
curious
mss
of
the
classics
having
satisfied
my
curiosity
at
rome
i
prepared
for
my
departure
and
as
the
road
between
radicofani
and
montefiascone
is
very
stony
and
disagreeable
i
asked
the
banker
barazzi
if
there
was
not
a
better
way
of
returning
to
florence
expressing
a
desire
at
the
same
time
to
see
the
cascade
of
terni
he
assured
me
that
the
road
by
terni
was
forty
miles
shorter
than
the
other
much
more
safe
and
easy
and
accommodated
with
exceeding
good
auberges
had
i
taken
the
trouble
to
cast
my
eyes
upon
the
map
i
must
have
seen
that
the
road
by
terni
instead
of
being
forty
miles
shorter
was
much
longer
than
the
other
but
this
was
not
the
only
mistake
of
signiore
barazzi
great
part
of
this
way
lies
over
steep
mountains
or
along
the
side
of
precipices
which
render
travelling
in
a
carriage
exceeding
tedious
dreadful
and
dangerous
and
as
for
the
public
houses
they
are
in
all
respects
the
most
execrable
that
ever
i
entered
i
will
venture
to
say
that
a
common
prisoner
in
the
marshalsea
or
is
more
cleanly
and
commodiously
lodged
than
we
were
in
many
places
on
this
road
the
houses
are
abominably
nasty
and
generally
destitute
of
provision
when
eatables
were
found
we
were
almost
poisoned
by
their
cookery
their
beds
were
without
curtains
or
bedstead
and
their
windows
without
glass
and
for
this
sort
of
entertainment
we
payed
as
much
as
if
we
had
been
genteelly
lodged
and
sumptuously
treated
i
repeat
it
again
of
all
the
people
i
ever
knew
the
italians
are
the
most
villainously
rapacious
the
first
day
having
passed
civita
castellana
a
small
town
standing
on
the
top
of
a
hill
we
put
up
at
what
was
called
an
excellent
inn
where
cardinals
prelates
and
princes
often
lodged
being
meagre
day
there
was
nothing
but
bread
eggs
and
anchovies
in
the
house
i
went
to
bed
without
supper
and
lay
in
a
pallet
where
i
was
half
devoured
by
vermin
next
day
our
road
in
some
places
lay
along
precipices
which
the
nera
or
nar
celebrated
in
antiquity
for
its
white
foam
and
the
sulphureous
quality
of
its
waters
sulfurea
nar
albus
aqua
fontesque
velini
sulphureous
nar
and
the
velinian
streams
it
is
a
small
but
rapid
stream
which
runs
not
far
from
hence
into
the
tyber
passing
utricoli
near
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
ocriculum
and
the
romantic
town
of
narni
situated
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
is
still
seen
standing
one
arch
of
the
stupendous
bridge
built
by
augustus
caesar
we
arrived
at
terni
and
hiring
a
couple
of
chaises
before
dinner
went
to
see
the
famous
cascata
delle
marmore
which
is
at
the
distance
of
three
miles
we
ascended
a
steep
mountain
by
a
narrow
road
formed
for
a
considerable
way
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
at
the
bottom
of
which
brawls
the
furious
river
nera
after
having
received
the
velino
this
last
is
the
stream
which
running
from
the
lago
delle
marmore
forms
the
cascade
by
falling
over
a
precipice
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
high
such
a
body
of
water
rushing
down
the
mountain
the
smoak
vapour
and
thick
white
mist
which
it
raises
the
double
rainbow
which
these
particles
continually
exhibit
while
the
sun
shines
the
deafening
sound
of
the
cataract
the
vicinity
of
a
great
number
of
other
stupendous
rocks
and
precipices
with
the
dashing
boiling
and
foaming
of
the
two
rivers
below
produce
altogether
an
object
of
tremendous
sublimity
yet
great
part
of
its
effect
is
lost
for
want
of
a
proper
point
of
view
from
which
it
might
be
contemplated
the
cascade
would
appear
much
more
astonishing
were
it
not
in
some
measure
eclipsed
by
the
superior
height
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
you
have
not
a
front
perspective
but
are
obliged
to
view
it
obliquely
on
one
side
standing
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipice
which
can
not
be
approached
without
horror
this
station
might
be
rendered
much
more
accessible
and
altogether
secure
for
the
expence
of
four
or
five
zequines
and
a
small
tax
might
be
levied
for
the
purpose
from
travellers
by
the
aubergiste
at
terni
who
lets
his
calasses
for
half
a
zequine
a
piece
to
those
that
are
curious
to
see
this
phaenomenon
besides
the
two
postilions
whom
i
payed
for
this
excursion
at
the
rate
of
one
stage
in
posting
there
was
a
fellow
who
posted
himself
behind
one
of
the
chaises
by
way
of
going
to
point
out
the
different
views
of
the
cascade
and
his
demand
amounted
to
four
or
five
pauls
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
extortion
of
those
villainous
publicans
i
must
tell
you
that
for
a
dinner
and
supper
which
even
hunger
could
not
tempt
us
to
eat
and
a
night
lodging
in
three
truckle
beds
i
paid
eighty
pauls
amounting
to
forty
shillings
sterling
you
ask
me
why
i
submitted
to
such
imposition
i
will
tell
you
i
have
more
than
once
in
my
travels
made
a
formal
complaint
of
the
exorbitancy
of
a
publican
to
the
magistrate
of
the
place
but
i
never
received
any
satisfaction
and
have
lost
abundance
of
time
had
i
proceeded
to
manual
correction
i
should
have
alarmed
and
terrified
the
women
had
i
peremptorily
refused
to
pay
the
sum
total
the
landlord
who
was
the
would
not
have
supplied
me
with
horses
to
proceed
on
my
journey
i
tried
the
experiment
at
muy
in
france
where
i
put
myself
into
a
violent
passion
had
abundance
of
trouble
was
detained
till
it
was
almost
night
and
after
all
found
myself
obliged
to
submit
furnishing
at
the
same
time
matter
of
infinite
triumph
to
the
mob
which
had
surrounded
the
coach
and
interested
themselves
warmly
in
favour
of
their
townsman
if
some
young
patriot
in
good
health
and
spirits
would
take
the
trouble
as
often
as
he
is
imposed
upon
by
the
road
in
travelling
to
have
recourse
to
the
and
prefer
a
regular
complaint
to
the
comptroller
of
the
posts
either
in
france
or
italy
he
would
have
ample
satisfaction
and
do
great
service
to
the
community
terni
is
an
agreeable
town
pretty
well
built
and
situated
in
a
pleasant
valley
between
two
branches
of
the
river
nera
whence
it
was
called
by
the
antients
interamna
here
is
an
agreeable
piazza
where
stands
a
church
that
was
of
old
a
heathen
temple
there
are
some
valuable
paintings
in
the
church
the
people
are
said
to
be
very
civil
and
provisions
to
be
extremely
cheap
it
was
the
birthplace
of
the
emperor
tacitus
as
well
as
of
the
historian
of
the
same
name
in
our
journey
from
hence
to
spoleto
we
passed
over
a
high
mountain
called
from
its
height
somma
where
it
was
necessary
to
have
two
additional
horses
to
the
carriage
and
the
road
winds
along
a
precipice
which
is
equally
dangerous
and
dreadful
we
passed
through
part
of
spoleto
the
capital
of
umbria
which
is
a
pretty
large
city
of
this
however
i
give
no
other
account
from
my
own
observation
but
that
i
saw
at
a
distance
the
famous
gothic
aqueduct
of
brick
this
is
mentioned
by
addison
as
a
structure
which
for
the
height
of
its
arches
is
not
equalled
by
any
thing
in
europe
the
road
from
hence
to
foligno
where
we
lay
is
kept
in
good
order
and
lies
through
a
delightful
plain
laid
out
into
beautiful
inclosures
abounding
with
wine
oil
corn
and
cattle
and
watered
by
the
pastoral
streams
of
the
famous
river
clitumnus
which
takes
its
rise
in
three
or
four
separate
rivulets
issuing
from
a
rock
near
the
highway
on
the
we
saw
several
towns
situated
on
rising
grounds
and
among
the
rest
that
of
assissio
famous
for
the
birth
of
francis
whose
body
being
here
deposited
occasions
a
concourse
of
pilgrims
we
met
a
roman
princess
going
thither
with
a
grand
retinue
in
consequence
of
a
vow
she
had
made
for
the
of
her
health
foligno
the
fulginium
of
the
antients
is
a
small
town
not
unpleasant
lying
in
the
midst
of
mulberry
plantations
vineyards
and
and
built
on
both
sides
of
the
little
river
topino
in
choosing
our
beds
at
the
inn
i
perceived
one
chamber
locked
and
desired
it
might
be
opened
upon
which
the
cameriere
declared
with
some
reluctance
besogna
dire
a
su
eccellenza
poco
fa
che
una
bestia
e
morta
in
questa
camera
e
non
e
ancora
lustrata
your
excellency
must
know
that
a
filthy
beast
died
lately
in
that
chamber
and
it
is
not
yet
purified
and
put
in
order
when
i
enquired
what
beast
it
was
he
replied
inglese
an
english
heretic
i
suppose
he
would
not
have
made
so
free
with
our
country
and
religion
if
he
had
not
taken
us
for
german
catholics
as
we
afterwards
learned
from
r
i
next
day
we
crossed
the
tyber
over
a
handsome
bridge
and
in
mounting
the
steep
hill
upon
which
the
city
of
perugia
stands
our
horses
being
exhausted
were
dragged
backwards
by
the
weight
of
the
carriage
to
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
where
happily
for
us
a
man
passing
that
way
placed
a
large
stone
behind
one
of
the
wheels
which
stopped
their
motion
otherwise
we
should
have
been
all
dashed
in
pieces
we
had
another
ugly
hill
to
ascend
within
the
city
which
was
more
difficult
and
dangerous
than
the
other
but
the
postilions
and
the
other
beasts
made
such
efforts
that
we
mounted
without
the
least
stop
to
the
summit
where
we
found
ourselves
in
a
large
piazza
where
the
horses
are
always
changed
there
being
no
relays
at
the
post
we
were
obliged
to
stay
the
whole
day
and
night
at
perugia
which
is
a
considerable
city
built
upon
the
acclivity
of
a
hill
adorned
with
some
elegant
fountains
and
several
handsome
churches
containing
some
valuable
pictures
by
guido
raphael
and
his
master
pietro
perugino
who
was
a
native
of
this
place
the
next
stage
is
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
which
was
the
thrasimene
of
the
antients
a
beautiful
piece
of
water
above
thirty
miles
in
circumference
having
three
islands
abounding
with
excellent
fish
upon
a
peninsula
of
it
there
is
a
town
and
castle
it
was
in
this
neighbourhood
where
the
consul
flaminius
was
totally
defeated
with
great
slaughter
by
hannibal
from
perugia
to
florence
the
posts
are
all
double
and
the
road
is
so
bad
that
we
never
could
travel
above
eight
and
twenty
miles
a
day
we
were
often
obliged
to
quit
the
carriage
and
walk
up
steep
mountains
and
the
way
in
general
was
so
unequal
and
stony
that
we
were
jolted
even
to
the
danger
of
our
lives
i
never
felt
any
sort
of
exercise
or
fatigue
so
intolerable
and
i
did
not
fail
to
bestow
an
hundred
benedictions
per
diem
upon
the
banker
barazzi
by
whose
advice
we
had
taken
this
road
yet
there
was
no
remedy
but
patience
if
the
coach
had
not
been
incredibly
strong
it
must
have
been
shattered
to
pieces
the
fifth
night
we
passed
at
a
place
called
camoccia
a
miserable
cabaret
where
we
were
fain
to
cook
our
own
supper
and
lay
in
a
musty
chamber
which
had
never
known
a
fire
and
indeed
had
no
and
where
we
ran
the
risque
of
being
devoured
by
rats
next
day
one
of
the
irons
of
the
coach
gave
way
at
arezzo
where
we
were
detained
two
hours
before
it
could
be
accommodated
i
might
have
taken
this
opportunity
to
view
the
remains
of
the
antient
etruscan
amphitheatre
and
the
temple
of
hercules
described
by
the
cavalier
lorenzo
guazzesi
as
standing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
place
but
the
blacksmith
assured
me
his
work
would
be
finished
in
a
few
minutes
and
as
i
had
nothing
so
much
at
heart
as
the
speedy
accomplishment
of
this
disagreeable
journey
i
chose
to
suppress
my
curiosity
rather
than
be
the
occasion
of
a
moment
delay
but
all
the
nights
we
had
hitherto
passed
were
comfortable
in
comparison
to
this
which
we
suffered
at
a
small
village
the
name
of
which
i
do
not
remember
the
house
was
dismal
and
dirty
beyond
all
description
the
filthy
enough
to
turn
the
stomach
of
a
muleteer
and
the
victuals
cooked
in
such
a
manner
that
even
a
hottentot
could
not
have
beheld
them
without
loathing
we
had
sheets
of
our
own
which
were
spread
upon
a
mattrass
and
here
i
took
my
repose
wrapped
in
a
greatcoat
if
that
could
be
called
repose
which
was
interrupted
by
the
innumerable
stings
of
vermin
in
the
morning
i
was
seized
with
a
dangerous
fit
of
which
terrified
my
wife
alarmed
my
people
and
brought
the
whole
community
into
the
house
i
had
undergone
just
such
another
at
paris
about
a
year
before
this
forenoon
one
of
our
coach
wheels
flew
off
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ancisa
a
small
town
where
we
were
detained
above
two
hours
by
this
accident
a
delay
which
was
productive
of
much
disappointment
danger
vexation
and
fatigue
there
being
no
horses
at
the
last
post
we
were
obliged
to
wait
until
those
which
brought
us
thither
were
sufficiently
refreshed
to
proceed
understanding
that
all
the
gates
of
florence
are
shut
at
six
except
two
that
are
kept
open
for
the
accommodation
of
travellers
and
that
to
reach
the
nearest
of
these
gates
it
was
necessary
to
pass
the
river
arno
in
a
which
could
not
transport
the
carriage
i
determined
to
send
my
servant
before
with
a
light
chaise
to
enter
the
nearest
gate
before
it
was
shut
and
provide
a
coach
to
come
and
take
us
up
at
the
side
of
the
river
where
we
should
be
obliged
to
pass
in
the
boat
for
i
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
lying
another
night
in
a
common
cabaret
here
however
another
difficulty
occurred
there
was
but
one
chaise
and
a
dragoon
officer
in
the
imperial
troops
insisted
upon
his
having
bespoke
it
for
himself
and
his
servant
a
long
dispute
ensued
which
had
like
to
have
produced
a
quarrel
but
at
length
i
accommodated
matters
by
telling
the
officer
that
he
should
have
a
place
in
it
gratis
and
his
servant
might
ride
he
accepted
the
offer
without
hesitation
but
in
the
mean
time
we
set
out
in
the
coach
before
them
and
having
proceeded
about
a
couple
of
miles
the
road
was
so
deep
from
a
heavy
rain
and
the
beasts
were
so
fatigued
that
they
could
not
proceed
the
postilions
scourging
the
poor
animals
with
great
barbarity
they
made
an
effort
and
pulled
the
coach
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
or
rather
a
kind
of
which
might
be
about
seven
or
eight
feet
lower
than
the
road
here
my
wife
and
i
leaped
out
and
stood
under
the
rain
up
to
the
ancles
in
mud
while
the
postilions
still
exercising
their
whips
one
of
the
fairly
tumbled
down
the
descent
arid
hung
by
the
neck
so
that
he
was
almost
strangled
before
he
could
be
disengaged
from
the
traces
by
the
assistance
of
some
foot
travellers
that
happened
to
pass
while
we
remained
in
this
dilemma
the
chaise
with
the
officer
and
my
servant
coming
up
we
exchanged
places
my
wife
and
i
proceeded
in
the
chaise
and
left
them
with
miss
c
and
r
to
follow
in
the
coach
the
road
from
hence
to
florence
is
nothing
but
a
succession
of
steep
mountains
paved
and
conducted
in
such
a
manner
that
one
would
imagine
the
design
had
been
to
render
it
impracticable
by
any
sort
of
notwithstanding
all
our
endeavours
i
found
it
would
be
impossible
to
enter
florence
before
the
gates
were
shut
i
flattered
and
threatened
the
driver
by
turns
but
the
fellow
who
had
been
remarkably
civil
at
first
grew
sullen
and
impertinent
he
told
me
i
must
not
think
of
reaching
florence
that
the
boat
would
not
take
the
carriage
on
board
and
that
from
the
other
side
i
must
walk
five
miles
before
i
should
reach
the
gate
that
was
open
but
he
would
carry
me
to
an
excellent
osteria
where
i
should
be
entertained
and
lodged
like
a
prince
i
was
now
convinced
that
he
had
lingered
on
purpose
to
serve
this
and
i
took
it
for
granted
that
what
he
told
me
of
the
distance
between
the
ferry
and
the
gate
was
a
lie
it
was
eight
when
we
arrived
at
his
inn
i
alighted
with
my
wife
to
view
the
chambers
desiring
he
would
not
put
up
his
horses
finding
it
was
a
villainous
house
we
came
forth
and
by
this
time
the
horses
were
put
up
i
asked
the
fellow
how
he
durst
presume
to
contradict
my
orders
and
commanded
him
to
put
them
to
the
chaise
he
asked
in
his
turn
if
i
was
mad
if
i
thought
i
and
the
lady
had
strength
and
courage
enough
to
walk
five
miles
in
the
dark
through
a
road
which
we
did
not
know
and
which
was
broke
up
by
a
continued
rain
of
two
days
i
told
him
he
was
an
impertinent
rascal
and
as
he
still
hesitated
i
collared
him
with
one
hand
and
shook
my
cane
over
his
head
with
the
other
it
was
the
only
weapon
i
had
either
offensive
or
defensive
for
i
had
left
my
sword
and
musquetoon
in
the
coach
at
length
the
fellow
obeyed
though
with
great
reluctance
cracking
many
severe
jokes
upon
us
in
the
mean
time
and
being
joined
in
his
raillery
by
the
who
had
all
the
external
marks
of
a
ruffian
the
house
stood
in
a
solitary
situation
and
not
a
soul
appeared
but
these
two
miscreants
so
that
they
might
have
murdered
us
without
fear
of
detection
you
do
not
like
the
apartments
said
one
to
be
sure
they
were
not
fitted
up
for
persons
of
your
rank
and
quality
you
will
be
glad
of
a
worse
chamber
continued
the
other
before
you
get
to
bed
if
you
walk
to
florence
tonight
you
will
sleep
so
sound
that
the
fleas
will
not
disturb
you
take
care
you
do
not
take
up
your
night
lodging
in
the
middle
of
the
road
or
in
the
ditch
of
the
i
fired
inwardly
at
these
sarcasms
to
which
however
i
made
no
reply
and
my
wife
was
almost
dead
with
fear
in
the
road
from
hence
to
the
boat
we
met
with
an
fellow
who
offered
his
service
to
conduct
us
into
the
city
and
such
was
our
situation
that
i
was
fain
to
accept
his
proposal
especially
as
we
had
two
small
boxes
in
the
chaise
by
accident
containing
some
caps
and
laces
belonging
to
my
wife
i
still
hoped
the
postilion
had
exaggerated
in
the
distance
between
the
boat
and
the
city
gate
and
was
confirmed
in
this
opinion
by
the
ferryman
who
said
we
had
not
above
half
a
league
to
walk
behold
us
then
in
this
expedition
myself
wrapped
up
in
a
very
heavy
greatcoat
and
my
cane
in
my
hand
i
did
not
imagine
i
could
have
walked
a
couple
of
miles
in
this
equipage
had
my
life
been
depending
my
wife
a
delicate
creature
who
had
scarce
ever
walked
a
mile
in
her
life
and
the
ragamuffin
before
us
with
our
boxes
under
his
arm
the
night
was
dark
and
wet
the
road
slippery
and
dirty
not
a
soul
was
seen
nor
a
sound
was
heard
all
was
silent
dreary
and
horrible
i
laid
my
account
with
a
violent
fit
of
illness
from
the
cold
i
should
infallibly
catch
if
i
escaped
assassination
the
fears
of
which
were
the
more
troublesome
as
i
had
no
weapon
to
defend
our
lives
while
i
laboured
under
the
weight
of
my
greatcoat
which
made
the
streams
of
sweat
flow
down
my
face
and
shoulders
i
was
plunging
in
the
mud
up
to
the
at
every
step
and
at
the
same
time
obliged
to
support
my
wife
who
wept
in
silence
half
dead
with
terror
and
fatigue
to
crown
our
vexation
our
conductor
walked
so
fast
that
he
was
often
out
of
sight
and
i
imagined
he
had
run
away
with
the
boxes
all
i
could
do
on
these
occasions
was
to
hollow
as
loud
as
i
could
and
swear
horribly
that
i
would
blow
his
brains
out
i
did
not
know
but
these
oaths
and
menaces
might
keep
other
rogues
in
awe
in
this
manner
did
we
travel
three
long
miles
making
almost
an
intire
circuit
of
the
without
seeing
the
face
of
a
human
creature
and
at
length
reached
the
gate
where
we
were
examined
by
the
guard
and
allowed
to
pass
after
they
had
told
us
it
was
a
long
mile
from
thence
to
the
house
of
vanini
where
we
proposed
to
lodge
no
matter
being
now
fairly
within
the
city
i
plucked
up
my
spirits
and
performed
the
rest
of
the
journey
with
such
ease
that
i
am
persuaded
i
could
have
walked
at
the
same
pace
all
night
long
without
being
very
much
fatigued
it
was
near
ten
at
night
when
we
entered
the
auberge
in
such
a
draggled
and
miserable
condition
that
vanini
almost
fainted
at
sight
of
us
on
the
supposition
that
we
had
met
with
some
terrible
disaster
and
that
the
rest
of
the
company
were
killed
my
wife
and
i
were
immediately
accommodated
with
dry
stockings
and
shoes
a
warm
apartment
and
a
good
supper
which
i
ate
with
great
satisfaction
arising
not
only
from
our
having
happily
survived
the
adventure
but
also
from
a
conviction
that
my
strength
and
constitution
were
wonderfully
repaired
not
but
that
i
still
expected
a
severe
cold
attended
with
a
terrible
fit
of
the
asthma
but
in
this
i
was
luckily
disappointed
i
now
for
the
first
time
drank
to
the
health
of
my
physician
barazzi
fully
persuaded
that
the
hardships
and
violent
exercise
i
underwent
by
following
his
advice
had
greatly
contributed
to
the
of
my
health
in
this
particular
i
imitate
the
gratitude
of
tavernier
who
was
radically
cured
of
the
gout
by
a
turkish
aga
in
aegypt
who
gave
him
the
bastinado
because
he
would
not
look
at
the
head
of
the
bashaw
of
cairo
which
the
aga
had
in
a
bag
to
be
presented
to
the
grand
signior
at
constantinople
i
did
not
expect
to
see
the
rest
of
our
company
that
night
as
i
never
doubted
but
they
would
stay
with
the
coach
at
the
inn
on
the
other
side
of
the
arno
but
at
we
were
joined
by
miss
c
and
r
who
had
left
the
carriage
at
the
inn
under
the
auspices
of
the
captain
and
my
servant
and
followed
our
by
walking
from
the
to
florence
conducted
by
one
of
the
boatmen
r
seemed
to
be
much
ruffled
and
chagrined
but
as
he
did
not
think
proper
to
explain
the
cause
he
had
no
right
to
expect
that
i
should
give
him
satisfaction
for
some
insult
he
had
received
from
my
servant
they
had
been
exposed
to
a
variety
of
disagreeable
adventures
from
the
impracticability
of
the
road
the
coach
had
been
several
times
in
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
being
lost
with
all
our
baggage
and
at
one
place
it
was
necessary
to
hire
a
dozen
of
oxen
and
as
many
men
to
disengage
it
from
the
holes
into
which
it
had
run
it
was
in
the
confusion
of
these
adventures
that
the
captain
and
his
valet
r
and
my
servant
had
like
to
have
gone
all
by
the
ears
together
the
peace
was
with
difficulty
preserved
by
the
interposition
of
miss
c
who
suffered
incredibly
from
cold
and
wet
terror
vexation
and
fatigue
yet
happily
no
bad
consequence
ensued
the
coach
and
baggage
were
brought
safely
into
florence
next
morning
when
all
of
us
found
ourselves
well
refreshed
and
in
good
spirits
i
am
afraid
this
is
not
the
case
with
you
who
must
by
this
time
be
quite
jaded
with
this
long
epistle
which
shall
therefore
be
closed
without
further
ceremony
by
yours
always
letter
xxxv
nice
march
dear
sir
the
season
being
far
advanced
and
the
weather
growing
boisterous
i
made
but
a
short
stay
at
florence
and
set
out
for
pisa
with
full
resolution
to
take
the
nearest
road
to
lerici
where
we
proposed
to
hire
a
felucca
for
genoa
i
had
a
great
desire
to
see
leghorn
and
lucca
but
the
dread
of
a
winter
voyage
by
sea
in
an
open
boat
effectually
restrained
my
curiosity
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
having
our
baggage
shifted
every
post
i
hired
two
chaises
to
pisa
for
a
couple
of
zequines
and
there
we
arrived
in
safety
about
seven
in
the
evening
though
not
without
fear
of
the
consequence
as
the
calesses
were
quite
open
and
it
rained
all
the
way
i
must
own
i
was
so
sick
of
the
wretched
accommodation
one
meets
with
in
every
part
of
italy
except
the
great
cities
so
averse
to
the
sea
at
this
season
and
so
fond
of
the
city
of
pisa
that
i
should
certainly
have
stayed
here
the
winter
had
not
i
been
separated
from
my
books
and
papers
as
well
as
from
other
conveniencies
and
connexions
which
i
had
at
nice
and
foreseen
that
the
thoughts
of
performing
the
same
disagreeable
voyage
in
the
spring
would
imbitter
my
whole
winter
enjoyment
i
again
hired
two
calesses
for
lerici
proposing
to
lie
at
sarzana
three
miles
short
of
that
place
where
we
were
told
we
should
find
comfortable
lodging
and
to
embark
next
day
without
halting
when
we
departed
in
the
morning
it
rained
very
hard
and
the
cerchio
which
the
chaises
had
formerly
passed
almost
without
wetting
the
wheels
was
now
swelled
to
a
mighty
river
broad
and
deep
and
rapid
it
was
with
great
difficulty
i
could
persuade
my
wife
to
enter
the
boat
for
it
blew
a
storm
and
she
had
seen
it
in
coming
over
from
the
other
side
hurried
down
a
considerable
way
by
the
rapidity
of
the
current
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
the
watermen
near
two
hours
were
spent
in
transporting
us
with
our
chaises
the
road
between
this
and
pietra
santa
was
rendered
almost
impassable
when
we
arrived
at
massa
it
began
to
grow
dark
and
the
assured
us
that
the
road
to
sarzana
was
overflowed
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
be
passed
even
in
the
without
imminent
danger
we
therefore
took
up
our
lodging
for
the
night
at
this
house
which
was
in
all
respects
one
of
the
worst
we
had
yet
entered
next
day
we
found
the
magra
as
large
and
violent
as
the
cerchio
however
we
passed
it
without
any
accident
and
in
the
afternoon
arrived
at
lerici
there
we
were
immediately
besieged
by
a
number
of
patrons
of
feluccas
from
among
whom
i
chose
a
spaniard
partly
because
he
looked
like
an
honest
man
and
produced
an
ample
certificate
signed
by
an
english
gentleman
and
partly
because
he
was
not
an
italian
for
by
this
time
i
had
imbibed
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
common
people
of
that
country
we
embarked
in
the
morning
before
day
with
a
gale
that
made
us
run
the
in
the
water
but
when
we
pretended
to
turn
the
point
of
porto
venere
we
found
the
wind
full
in
our
teeth
and
were
obliged
to
return
to
our
quarters
where
we
had
been
shamefully
fleeced
by
the
landlord
who
nevertheless
was
not
such
an
exorbitant
knave
as
the
whose
house
i
would
advise
all
travellers
to
avoid
here
indeed
i
had
occasion
to
see
an
instance
of
prudence
and
oeconomy
which
i
should
certainly
imitate
if
ever
i
had
occasion
to
travel
this
way
by
myself
an
englishman
who
had
hired
a
felucca
from
antibes
to
leghorn
was
put
in
here
by
stress
of
weather
but
being
aware
of
the
extortion
of
innkeepers
and
the
bad
accommodation
in
their
houses
he
slept
on
board
on
his
own
mattrasses
and
there
likewise
he
had
all
his
conveniencies
for
eating
he
sent
his
servant
on
shore
occasionally
to
buy
provision
and
see
it
cooked
according
to
his
direction
in
some
public
house
and
had
his
meals
regularly
in
the
felucca
this
evening
he
came
ashore
to
stretch
his
legs
and
took
a
solitary
walk
on
the
beach
avoiding
us
with
great
care
although
he
knew
we
were
english
his
valet
who
was
abundantly
communicative
told
my
servant
that
in
coming
through
france
his
master
had
travelled
three
days
in
company
with
two
other
english
gentlemen
whom
he
met
upon
the
road
and
in
all
that
time
he
never
spoke
a
word
to
either
yet
in
other
respects
he
was
a
good
man
mild
charitable
and
humane
this
is
a
character
truly
british
at
five
in
the
morning
we
put
to
sea
again
and
though
the
wind
was
contrary
made
shift
to
reach
the
town
of
sestri
di
levante
where
we
were
most
graciously
received
by
the
publican
butcher
and
his
family
the
house
was
in
much
better
order
than
before
the
people
were
much
more
obliging
we
passed
a
very
tolerable
night
and
had
a
very
reasonable
bill
to
pay
in
the
morning
i
can
not
account
for
this
favourable
change
any
other
way
than
by
ascribing
it
to
the
effects
of
a
terrible
storm
which
had
two
days
before
torn
up
a
great
number
of
their
by
the
roots
and
done
such
damage
as
terrified
them
into
humility
and
submission
next
day
the
water
being
delightful
we
arrived
by
one
in
the
afternoon
at
genoa
here
i
made
another
bargain
with
our
patron
antonio
to
carry
us
to
nice
he
had
been
hitherto
remarkably
obliging
and
seemingly
modest
he
spoke
latin
fluently
and
was
tinctured
with
the
sciences
i
began
to
imagine
he
was
a
person
of
a
good
family
who
had
met
with
misfortunes
in
life
and
respected
him
accordingly
but
i
afterwards
found
him
mercenary
mean
and
rapacious
the
wind
being
still
contrary
when
we
departed
from
genoa
we
could
get
no
further
than
finale
where
we
lodged
in
a
very
dismal
habitation
which
was
recommended
to
us
as
the
best
auberge
in
the
place
what
rendered
it
the
more
uncomfortable
the
night
was
cold
and
there
was
not
a
in
the
house
except
in
the
kitchen
the
beds
if
they
deserved
that
name
were
so
shockingly
nasty
that
we
could
not
have
used
them
had
not
a
friend
of
r
supplied
us
with
mattrasses
sheets
and
coverlets
for
our
own
sheets
were
on
board
the
felucca
which
was
anchored
at
a
distance
from
the
shore
our
fare
was
equally
wretched
the
master
of
the
house
was
a
surly
assassin
and
his
cameriere
or
waiter
mad
our
situation
was
at
the
same
time
shocking
and
ridiculous
r
quarrelled
over
night
with
the
master
who
swore
in
broken
french
to
my
man
that
he
had
a
good
mind
to
poniard
that
impertinent
piedmontese
in
the
morning
before
day
r
coming
into
my
chamber
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
had
been
insulted
by
the
landlord
who
demanded
six
and
thirty
livres
for
our
supper
and
lodging
incensed
at
the
presumption
i
assured
him
i
would
make
him
take
half
the
money
and
a
good
beating
into
the
bargain
he
replied
that
he
would
have
saved
me
the
trouble
of
beating
him
had
not
the
cameriere
who
was
a
very
sensible
fellow
assured
him
the
padrone
was
out
of
his
senses
and
if
roughly
handled
might
commit
some
extravagance
though
i
was
exceedingly
ruffled
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
mad
palming
himself
upon
r
y
as
a
sensible
fellow
and
transferring
the
charge
of
madness
upon
his
master
who
seemed
to
be
much
more
knave
than
fool
while
r
went
to
mass
i
desired
the
cameriere
to
bid
his
master
bring
the
bill
and
to
tell
him
that
if
it
was
not
reasonable
i
would
carry
him
before
the
commandant
in
the
mean
time
i
armed
myself
with
my
sword
in
one
hand
and
my
cane
in
the
other
the
immediately
entered
pale
and
staring
and
when
i
demanded
his
bill
he
told
me
with
a
profound
reverence
that
he
should
be
satisfied
with
whatever
i
myself
thought
proper
to
give
surprised
at
this
moderation
i
asked
if
he
should
be
content
with
twelve
livres
and
he
answered
contentissimo
with
another
prostration
then
he
made
an
apology
for
the
bad
accommodation
of
his
house
and
complained
that
the
reproaches
of
the
other
gentleman
whom
he
was
pleased
to
call
my
majorduomo
had
almost
turned
his
brain
when
he
quitted
the
room
his
cameriere
laying
hold
of
his
master
last
words
pointed
to
his
own
forehead
and
said
he
had
informed
the
gentleman
over
night
that
his
patron
was
mad
this
day
we
were
by
a
high
wind
in
the
afternoon
driven
for
shelter
into
porto
mauritio
where
we
found
the
even
worse
than
that
of
finale
and
what
rendered
it
more
shocking
was
a
girl
quite
covered
with
the
confluent
smallpox
who
lay
in
a
room
through
which
it
was
necessary
to
pass
to
the
other
chambers
and
who
smelled
so
strong
as
to
perfume
the
whole
house
we
were
but
fifteen
miles
from
remo
where
i
knew
the
auberge
was
tolerable
and
thither
i
resolved
to
travel
by
land
i
accordingly
ordered
five
mules
to
travel
post
and
a
very
ridiculous
cavalcade
we
formed
the
women
being
obliged
to
use
common
saddles
for
in
this
country
even
the
ladies
sit
astride
the
road
lay
along
one
continued
precipice
and
was
so
difficult
that
the
beasts
never
could
exceed
a
walking
pace
in
some
places
we
were
obliged
to
alight
seven
hours
were
spent
in
travelling
fifteen
short
miles
at
length
we
arrived
at
our
old
lodgings
in
remo
which
we
found
and
in
great
order
we
supped
pretty
comfortably
slept
well
and
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
imposition
in
paying
the
bill
this
was
not
the
case
in
the
article
of
the
mules
for
which
i
was
obliged
to
pay
fifty
livres
according
to
the
regulation
of
the
posts
the
postmaster
who
came
along
with
us
had
the
effrontery
to
tell
me
that
if
i
had
hired
the
mules
to
carry
me
and
my
company
to
remo
in
the
way
of
common
travelling
they
would
have
cost
me
but
fifteen
livres
but
as
i
demanded
i
must
submit
to
the
regulations
this
is
a
distinction
the
more
absurd
as
the
road
is
of
such
a
nature
as
renders
it
impossible
to
travel
faster
in
one
way
than
in
another
nor
indeed
is
there
the
least
difference
either
in
the
carriage
or
convenience
between
travelling
post
and
journey
riding
a
publican
might
with
the
same
reason
charge
me
three
livres
a
pound
for
whiting
and
if
questioned
about
the
imposition
reply
that
if
i
had
asked
for
fish
i
should
have
had
the
same
whiting
for
the
fifth
part
of
the
money
but
that
he
made
a
wide
difference
between
selling
it
as
fish
and
selling
it
as
whiting
our
felucca
came
round
from
porto
mauritio
in
the
night
and
embarking
next
morning
we
arrived
at
nice
about
four
in
the
afternoon
thus
have
i
given
you
a
circumstantial
detail
of
my
italian
expedition
during
which
i
was
exposed
to
a
great
number
of
hardships
which
i
thought
my
weakened
constitution
could
not
have
bore
as
well
as
to
violent
fits
of
passion
chequered
however
with
transports
of
a
more
agreeable
nature
insomuch
that
i
may
say
i
was
for
two
months
continually
agitated
either
in
mind
or
body
and
very
often
in
both
at
the
same
time
as
my
disorder
at
first
arose
from
a
sedentary
life
producing
a
relaxation
of
the
fibres
which
naturally
brought
on
a
listlessness
indolence
and
dejection
of
the
spirits
i
am
convinced
that
this
hard
exercise
of
mind
and
body
with
the
change
of
air
and
objects
to
brace
up
the
relaxed
constitution
and
promote
a
more
vigorous
circulation
of
the
juices
which
had
long
languished
even
almost
to
stagnation
for
some
years
i
had
been
as
subject
to
colds
as
a
delicate
woman
new
delivered
if
i
ventured
to
go
abroad
when
there
was
the
least
moisture
either
in
the
air
or
upon
the
ground
i
was
sure
to
be
laid
up
a
fortnight
with
a
cough
and
asthma
but
in
this
journey
i
suffered
cold
and
rain
and
stood
and
walked
in
the
wet
heated
myself
with
exercise
and
sweated
violently
without
feeling
the
least
disorder
but
on
the
contrary
felt
myself
growing
stronger
every
day
in
the
midst
of
these
excesses
since
my
return
to
nice
it
has
rained
the
best
part
of
two
months
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
people
in
the
country
yet
during
all
that
time
i
have
enjoyed
good
health
and
spirits
on
i
went
to
the
cathedral
at
midnight
to
hear
high
mass
celebrated
by
the
new
bishop
of
nice
in
pontificalibus
and
stood
near
two
hours
uncovered
in
a
cold
gallery
without
having
any
cause
in
the
sequel
to
repent
of
my
curiosity
in
a
word
i
am
now
so
well
that
i
no
longer
despair
of
seeing
you
and
the
rest
of
my
friends
in
england
a
pleasure
which
is
eagerly
desired
by
dear
sir
your
affectionate
humble
servant
letter
xxxvi
nice
march
dear
sir
you
ask
whether
i
think
the
french
people
are
more
taxed
than
the
english
but
i
apprehend
the
question
would
be
more
apropos
if
you
asked
whether
the
french
taxes
are
more
insupportable
than
the
english
for
in
comparing
burthens
we
ought
always
to
consider
the
strength
of
the
shoulders
that
bear
them
i
know
no
better
way
of
estimating
the
strength
than
by
examining
the
face
of
the
country
and
observing
the
appearance
of
the
common
people
who
constitute
the
bulk
of
every
nation
when
i
therefore
see
the
country
of
england
smiling
with
cultivation
the
grounds
exhibiting
all
the
perfection
of
agriculture
parcelled
out
into
beautiful
inclosures
cornfields
hay
and
pasture
woodland
and
common
when
i
see
her
meadows
well
stocked
with
black
cattle
her
downs
covered
with
sheep
when
i
view
her
teams
of
horses
and
oxen
large
and
strong
fat
and
sleek
when
i
see
her
the
habitations
of
plenty
cleanliness
and
convenience
and
her
peasants
well
fed
well
lodged
well
cloathed
tall
and
stout
and
hale
and
jolly
i
can
not
help
concluding
that
the
people
are
well
able
to
bear
those
impositions
which
the
public
necessities
have
rendered
necessary
on
the
other
hand
when
i
perceive
such
signs
of
poverty
misery
and
dirt
among
the
commonalty
of
france
their
unfenced
fields
dug
up
in
despair
without
the
intervention
of
meadow
or
fallow
ground
without
cattle
to
furnish
manure
without
horses
to
execute
the
plans
of
agriculture
their
mean
their
furniture
wretched
their
apparel
beggarly
themselves
and
their
beasts
the
images
of
famine
i
can
not
help
thinking
they
groan
under
oppression
either
from
their
landlords
or
their
government
probably
from
both
the
principal
impositions
of
the
french
government
are
these
first
the
taille
payed
by
all
the
commons
except
those
that
are
privileged
secondly
the
capitation
from
which
no
persons
not
even
the
nobles
are
excepted
thirdly
the
tenths
and
twentieths
called
dixiemes
and
vingtiemes
which
every
body
pays
this
tax
was
originally
levied
as
an
occasional
aid
in
times
of
war
and
other
emergencies
but
by
degrees
is
become
a
standing
revenue
even
in
time
of
peace
all
the
money
arising
from
these
impositions
goes
directly
to
the
king
treasury
and
must
undoubtedly
amount
to
a
very
great
sum
besides
these
he
has
the
revenue
of
the
farms
consisting
of
the
droits
or
excise
on
wine
brandy
of
the
duties
of
the
gabelle
comprehending
that
most
oppressive
obligation
on
individuals
to
take
a
certain
quantity
of
salt
at
the
price
which
the
farmers
shall
please
to
fix
of
the
exclusive
privilege
to
sell
tobacco
of
the
droits
de
controlle
insinuation
centieme
denier
franchiefs
aubeine
echange
et
arising
from
the
acts
of
voluntary
jurisdiction
as
well
as
certain
these
farms
are
said
to
bring
into
the
king
coffers
above
one
hundred
and
twenty
millions
of
livres
yearly
amounting
to
near
five
millions
sterling
but
the
poor
people
are
said
to
pay
about
a
third
more
than
this
sum
which
the
farmers
retain
to
enrich
themselves
and
bribe
the
great
for
their
protection
which
protection
of
the
great
is
the
true
reason
why
this
most
iniquitous
oppressive
and
absurd
method
of
levying
money
is
not
laid
aside
over
and
above
those
articles
i
have
mentioned
the
french
king
draws
considerable
sums
from
his
clergy
under
the
denomination
of
dons
gratuits
or
as
well
as
from
the
subsidies
given
by
the
pays
such
as
provence
languedoc
and
bretagne
which
are
exempted
from
the
taille
the
whole
revenue
of
the
french
king
amounts
to
between
twelve
and
thirteen
millions
sterling
these
are
great
resources
for
the
king
but
they
will
always
keep
the
people
miserable
and
effectually
prevent
them
from
making
such
improvements
as
might
turn
their
lands
to
the
best
advantage
but
besides
being
eased
in
the
article
of
taxes
there
is
something
else
required
to
make
them
exert
themselves
for
the
benefit
of
their
country
they
must
be
free
in
their
persons
secure
in
their
property
indulged
with
reasonable
leases
and
effectually
protected
by
law
from
the
insolence
and
oppression
of
their
superiors
great
as
the
french
king
resources
may
appear
they
are
hardly
sufficient
to
defray
the
enormous
expence
of
his
government
about
two
millions
sterling
per
annum
of
his
revenue
are
said
to
be
anticipated
for
paying
the
interest
of
the
public
debts
and
the
rest
is
found
inadequate
to
the
charge
of
a
prodigious
standing
army
a
double
frontier
of
fortified
towns
and
the
extravagant
appointments
of
ambassadors
generals
governors
intendants
commandants
and
other
officers
of
the
crown
all
of
whom
affect
a
pomp
which
is
equally
ridiculous
and
prodigal
a
french
general
in
the
field
is
always
attended
by
thirty
or
forty
cooks
and
thinks
it
is
incumbent
upon
him
for
the
glory
of
france
to
give
a
hundred
dishes
every
day
at
his
table
when
don
philip
and
the
marechal
duke
de
belleisle
had
their
quarters
at
nice
there
were
fifty
scullions
constantly
employed
in
the
great
square
in
plucking
poultry
this
absurd
luxury
infects
their
whole
army
even
the
commissaries
keep
open
table
and
nothing
is
seen
but
prodigality
and
profusion
the
king
of
sardinia
proceeds
upon
another
plan
his
troops
are
better
cloathed
better
payed
and
better
fed
than
those
of
france
the
commandant
of
nice
has
about
four
hundred
a
year
of
appointments
which
enable
him
to
live
decently
and
even
to
entertain
strangers
on
the
other
hand
the
commandant
of
antibes
which
is
in
all
respects
more
inconsiderable
than
nice
has
from
the
french
king
above
five
times
the
sum
to
support
the
glory
of
his
monarch
which
all
the
sensible
part
of
mankind
treat
with
ridicule
and
contempt
but
the
finances
of
france
are
so
ill
managed
that
many
of
their
commandants
and
other
officers
have
not
been
able
to
draw
their
appointments
these
two
years
in
vain
they
complain
and
remonstrate
when
they
grow
troublesome
they
are
removed
how
then
must
they
support
the
glory
of
france
how
but
by
oppressing
the
poor
people
the
treasurer
makes
use
of
their
money
for
his
own
benefit
the
king
knows
it
he
knows
his
officers
thus
defrauded
fleece
and
oppress
his
people
but
he
thinks
proper
to
wink
at
these
abuses
that
government
may
be
said
to
be
weak
and
tottering
which
finds
itself
obliged
to
connive
at
such
proceedings
the
king
of
france
in
order
to
give
strength
and
stability
to
his
administration
ought
to
have
sense
to
adopt
a
sage
plan
of
oeconomy
and
vigour
of
mind
sufficient
to
execute
it
in
all
its
parts
with
the
most
rigorous
exactness
he
ought
to
have
courage
enough
to
find
fault
and
even
to
punish
the
delinquents
of
what
quality
soever
they
may
be
and
the
first
act
of
reformation
ought
to
be
a
total
abolition
of
all
the
farms
there
are
undoubtedly
many
marks
of
relaxation
in
the
reins
of
the
french
government
and
in
all
probability
the
subjects
of
france
will
be
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
it
there
is
at
present
a
violent
fermentation
of
different
principles
among
them
which
under
the
reign
of
a
very
weak
prince
or
during
a
long
minority
may
produce
a
great
change
in
the
constitution
in
proportion
to
the
progress
of
reason
and
philosophy
which
have
made
great
advances
in
this
kingdom
superstition
loses
ground
antient
prejudices
give
way
a
spirit
of
freedom
takes
the
ascendant
all
the
learned
laity
of
france
detest
the
hierarchy
as
a
plan
of
despotism
founded
on
imposture
and
usurpation
the
protestants
who
are
very
numerous
in
southern
parts
abhor
it
with
all
the
rancour
of
religious
fanaticism
many
of
the
commons
enriched
by
commerce
and
manufacture
grow
impatient
of
those
odious
distinctions
which
exclude
them
from
the
honours
and
privileges
due
to
their
importance
in
the
commonwealth
and
all
the
parliaments
or
tribunals
of
justice
in
the
kingdom
seem
bent
upon
asserting
their
rights
and
independence
in
the
face
of
the
king
prerogative
and
even
at
the
expence
of
his
power
and
authority
should
any
prince
therefore
be
seduced
by
evil
counsellors
or
misled
by
his
own
bigotry
to
take
some
arbitrary
step
that
may
be
extremely
disagreeable
to
all
those
communities
without
having
spirit
to
exert
the
violence
of
his
power
for
the
support
of
his
measures
he
will
become
equally
detested
and
despised
and
the
influence
of
the
commons
will
insensibly
encroach
upon
the
pretensions
of
the
crown
but
if
in
the
time
of
a
minority
the
power
of
the
government
should
be
divided
among
different
competitors
for
the
regency
the
parliaments
and
people
will
find
it
still
more
easy
to
acquire
and
ascertain
the
liberty
at
which
they
aspire
because
they
will
have
the
balance
of
power
in
their
hands
and
be
able
to
make
either
scale
preponderate
i
could
say
a
great
deal
more
upon
this
subject
and
i
have
some
remarks
to
make
relating
to
the
methods
which
might
be
taken
in
the
case
of
a
fresh
rupture
with
france
for
making
a
vigorous
impression
on
that
kingdom
but
these
i
in
list
defer
till
another
occasion
having
neither
room
nor
leisure
at
present
to
add
any
thing
but
that
i
am
with
great
truth
dear
sir
your
very
humble
servant
letter
xxxvii
nice
april
dear
doctor
as
i
have
now
passed
a
second
winter
at
nice
i
think
myself
qualified
to
make
some
further
remarks
on
this
climate
during
the
heats
of
last
summer
i
flattered
myself
with
the
prospect
of
the
fine
weather
i
should
enjoy
in
the
winter
but
neither
i
nor
any
person
in
this
country
could
foresee
the
rainy
weather
that
prevailed
from
the
middle
of
november
till
the
twentieth
of
march
in
this
short
period
of
four
months
we
have
had
days
of
rain
which
i
take
to
be
a
greater
quantity
than
generally
falls
during
the
six
worst
months
of
the
year
in
the
county
of
middlesex
especially
as
it
was
for
the
most
part
a
heavy
continued
rain
the
south
winds
generally
predominate
in
the
wet
season
at
nice
but
this
winter
the
rain
was
accompanied
with
every
wind
that
blows
except
the
south
though
the
most
frequent
were
those
that
came
from
the
east
and
north
quarters
notwithstanding
these
great
rains
such
as
were
never
known
before
at
nice
in
the
memory
of
man
the
intermediate
days
of
fair
weather
were
delightful
and
the
ground
seemed
perfectly
dry
the
air
itself
was
perfectly
free
from
moisture
though
i
live
upon
a
ground
floor
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
garden
i
could
not
perceive
the
least
damp
either
on
the
floors
or
the
furniture
neither
was
i
much
incommoded
by
the
asthma
which
used
always
to
harass
me
most
in
wet
weather
in
a
word
i
passed
the
winter
here
much
more
comfortably
than
i
expected
about
the
vernal
equinox
however
i
caught
a
violent
cold
which
was
attended
with
a
difficulty
of
breathing
and
as
the
sun
advances
towards
the
tropic
i
find
myself
still
more
subject
to
rheums
as
the
heat
increases
the
humours
of
the
body
are
rarefied
and
of
consequence
the
pores
of
the
skin
are
opened
while
the
east
wind
sweeping
over
the
alps
and
apennines
covered
with
snow
continues
surprisingly
sharp
and
penetrating
even
the
people
of
the
country
who
enjoy
good
health
are
afraid
of
exposing
themselves
to
the
air
at
this
season
the
intemperature
of
which
may
last
till
the
middle
of
may
when
all
the
snow
on
the
mountains
will
probably
be
melted
then
the
air
will
become
mild
and
balmy
till
in
the
progress
of
summer
it
grows
disagreeably
hot
and
the
strong
evaporation
from
the
sea
makes
it
so
saline
as
to
be
unhealthy
for
those
who
have
a
scorbutical
habit
when
the
is
high
this
evaporation
is
so
great
as
to
cover
the
surface
of
the
body
with
a
kind
of
volatile
brine
as
i
plainly
perceived
last
summer
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
this
climate
is
unfavourable
for
the
scurvy
were
i
obliged
to
pass
my
life
in
it
i
would
endeavour
to
find
a
country
retreat
among
the
mountains
at
some
distance
from
the
sea
where
i
might
enjoy
a
cool
air
free
from
this
impregnation
unmolested
by
those
flies
gnats
and
other
vermin
which
render
the
lower
parts
almost
uninhabitable
to
this
place
i
would
retire
in
the
month
of
june
and
there
continue
till
the
beginning
of
october
when
i
would
return
to
my
habitation
in
nice
where
the
winter
is
remarkably
mild
and
agreeable
in
march
and
april
however
i
would
not
advise
a
valetudinarian
to
go
forth
without
taking
precaution
against
the
cold
an
agreeable
summer
retreat
may
be
found
on
the
other
side
of
the
var
at
or
near
the
town
of
grasse
which
is
pleasantly
situated
on
the
ascent
of
a
hill
in
provence
about
seven
english
miles
from
nice
this
place
is
famous
for
its
pomatum
gloves
perfumes
and
lined
with
bergamot
i
am
told
it
affords
good
lodging
and
is
well
supplied
with
provisions
we
are
now
preparing
for
our
journey
to
england
from
the
exercise
of
which
i
promise
myself
much
benefit
a
journey
extremely
agreeable
not
only
on
that
account
but
also
because
it
will
restore
me
to
the
company
of
my
friends
and
remove
me
from
a
place
where
i
leave
nothing
but
the
air
which
i
can
possibly
regret
the
only
friendships
i
have
contracted
at
nice
are
with
strangers
who
like
myself
only
sojourn
here
for
a
season
i
now
find
by
experience
it
is
great
folly
to
buy
furniture
unless
one
is
resolved
to
settle
here
for
some
years
the
nissards
assured
me
with
great
confidence
that
i
should
always
be
able
to
sell
it
for
a
very
little
loss
whereas
i
find
myself
obliged
to
part
with
it
for
about
of
what
it
cost
i
have
sent
for
a
coach
to
aix
and
as
soon
as
it
arrives
shall
take
my
departure
so
that
the
next
letter
you
receive
from
me
will
be
dated
at
some
place
on
the
road
i
purpose
to
take
antibes
toulon
marseilles
aix
avignon
and
orange
in
my
way
places
which
i
have
not
yet
seen
and
where
perhaps
i
shall
find
something
for
your
amusement
which
will
always
be
a
consideration
of
some
weight
with
dear
sir
yours
letter
xxxviii
to
s
at
nice
turin
march
dear
sir
turin
is
about
thirty
leagues
from
nice
the
greater
part
of
the
way
lying
over
frightful
mountains
covered
with
snow
the
difficulty
of
the
road
however
reaches
no
farther
than
coni
from
whence
there
is
an
open
highway
through
a
fine
plain
country
as
far
as
the
capital
of
piedmont
and
the
traveller
is
accommodated
with
chaise
and
horses
to
proceed
either
post
or
by
cambiatura
as
in
other
parts
of
italy
there
are
only
two
ways
of
performing
the
journey
over
the
mountains
from
nice
one
is
to
ride
a
and
the
other
to
be
carried
in
a
chair
the
former
i
chose
and
set
out
with
my
servant
on
the
seventh
day
of
february
at
two
in
the
afternoon
i
was
hardly
clear
of
nice
when
it
began
to
rain
so
hard
that
in
less
than
an
hour
the
mud
was
half
a
foot
deep
in
many
parts
of
the
road
this
was
the
only
inconvenience
we
suffered
the
way
being
in
other
respects
practicable
enough
for
there
is
but
one
small
hill
to
cross
on
this
side
of
the
village
of
where
we
arrived
about
six
in
the
evening
the
ground
in
this
neighbourhood
is
tolerably
cultivated
and
the
mountains
are
planted
to
the
tops
with
olive
trees
the
accommodation
here
is
so
very
bad
that
i
had
no
inclination
to
be
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
refreshment
and
therefore
i
proceeded
on
my
journey
at
two
in
the
morning
conducted
by
a
guide
whom
i
hired
for
this
purpose
at
the
rate
of
three
livres
a
day
having
ascended
one
side
and
descended
the
other
of
the
mountain
called
braus
which
took
up
four
hours
though
the
road
is
not
bad
we
at
six
reached
the
village
of
sospello
which
is
agreeably
situated
in
a
small
valley
surrounded
by
prodigious
high
and
barren
mountains
this
little
plain
is
pretty
fertile
and
being
watered
by
a
pleasant
stream
forms
a
delightful
contrast
with
the
hideous
rocks
that
surround
it
having
reposed
myself
and
my
mules
two
hours
at
this
place
we
continued
our
journey
over
the
second
mountain
called
brovis
which
is
rather
more
considerable
than
the
first
and
in
four
hours
arrived
at
la
giandola
a
tolerable
inn
situated
betwixt
the
high
road
and
a
small
river
about
a
gunshot
from
the
town
of
brieglie
which
we
leave
on
the
right
as
we
jogged
along
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
i
was
a
little
startled
at
two
figures
which
i
saw
before
me
and
began
to
put
my
pistols
in
order
it
must
be
observed
that
these
mountains
are
infested
with
contrabandiers
a
set
of
smuggling
peasants
very
bold
and
desperate
who
make
a
traffic
of
selling
tobacco
salt
and
other
merchandize
which
have
not
payed
duty
and
sometimes
lay
travellers
under
contribution
i
did
not
doubt
but
there
was
a
gang
of
these
at
hand
but
as
no
more
than
two
persons
appeared
i
resolved
to
let
them
know
we
were
prepared
for
defence
and
fired
one
of
my
pistols
in
hope
that
the
report
of
it
echoed
from
the
surrounding
rocks
would
produce
a
proper
effect
but
the
mountains
and
roads
being
entirely
covered
with
snow
to
a
considerable
depth
there
was
little
or
no
reverberation
and
the
sound
was
not
louder
than
that
of
a
although
the
piece
contained
a
good
charge
of
powder
nevertheless
it
did
not
fail
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
strangers
one
of
whom
immediately
wheeled
to
the
left
about
and
being
by
this
time
very
near
me
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
contemplating
his
whole
person
he
was
very
tall
meagre
and
yellow
with
a
long
hooked
nose
and
small
twinkling
eyes
his
head
was
eased
in
a
woollen
over
which
he
wore
a
flapped
hat
he
had
a
silk
handkerchief
about
his
neck
and
his
mouth
was
furnished
with
a
short
wooden
pipe
from
which
he
discharged
wreathing
clouds
of
he
was
wrapped
in
a
kind
of
capot
of
green
bays
lined
with
had
a
pair
of
monstrous
boots
quilted
on
the
inside
with
cotton
was
almost
covered
with
dirt
and
rode
a
mule
so
low
that
his
long
legs
hung
dangling
within
six
inches
of
the
ground
this
grotesque
figure
was
so
much
more
ludicrous
than
terrible
that
i
could
not
help
laughing
when
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
he
very
politely
accosted
me
by
name
you
may
easily
guess
i
was
exceedingly
surprised
at
such
an
address
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
brovis
but
he
forthwith
put
an
end
to
it
too
by
discovering
himself
to
be
the
marquis
m
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
be
acquainted
with
at
nice
after
having
rallied
him
upon
his
equipage
he
gave
me
to
understand
he
had
set
out
from
nice
the
morning
of
the
same
day
that
i
departed
that
he
was
going
to
turin
and
that
he
had
sent
one
of
his
servants
before
him
to
coni
with
his
baggage
knowing
him
to
be
an
agreeable
companion
i
was
glad
of
this
encounter
and
we
resolved
to
travel
the
rest
of
the
way
together
we
dined
at
la
giandola
and
in
the
afternoon
rode
along
the
little
river
roida
which
runs
in
a
bottom
between
frightful
precipices
and
in
several
places
forms
natural
cascades
the
noise
of
which
had
deprived
us
of
the
sense
of
hearing
after
a
winding
course
among
these
mountains
it
discharges
itself
into
the
mediterranean
at
vintimiglia
in
the
territory
of
genoa
as
the
snow
did
not
lie
on
these
mountains
when
we
cracked
our
whips
there
was
such
a
repercussion
of
the
sound
as
is
altogether
inconceivable
we
passed
by
the
village
of
saorgio
situated
on
an
eminence
where
there
is
a
small
fortress
which
commands
the
whole
pass
and
in
five
hours
arrived
at
our
inn
on
this
side
the
col
de
tende
where
we
took
up
our
quarters
but
had
very
little
reason
to
boast
of
our
entertainment
our
greatest
difficulty
however
consisted
in
pulling
off
the
marquis
boots
which
were
of
the
kind
called
seafarot
by
this
time
so
loaded
with
dirt
on
the
outside
and
so
swelled
with
the
rain
within
that
he
could
neither
drag
them
after
him
as
he
walked
nor
disencumber
his
legs
of
them
without
such
violence
as
seemed
almost
sufficient
to
tear
him
limb
from
limb
in
a
word
we
were
obliged
to
tie
a
rope
about
his
heel
and
all
the
people
in
the
house
assisting
to
pull
the
poor
marquis
was
drawn
from
one
end
of
the
apartment
to
the
other
before
the
boot
would
give
way
at
last
his
legs
were
happily
disengaged
and
the
machines
carefully
dried
and
stuffed
for
next
day
journey
we
took
our
departure
from
hence
at
three
in
the
morning
and
at
four
began
to
mount
the
col
de
tende
which
is
by
far
the
highest
mountain
in
the
whole
journey
it
was
now
quite
covered
with
snow
which
at
the
top
of
it
was
near
twenty
feet
thick
half
way
up
there
are
quarters
for
a
detachment
of
soldiers
posted
here
to
prevent
smuggling
and
an
inn
called
la
ca
which
in
the
language
of
the
country
signifies
the
house
at
this
place
we
hired
six
men
to
assist
us
in
ascending
the
mountain
each
of
them
provided
with
a
kind
of
hough
to
break
the
ice
and
make
a
sort
of
steps
for
the
mules
when
we
were
near
the
top
however
we
were
obliged
to
alight
and
climb
the
mountain
supported
each
by
two
of
those
men
called
coulants
who
walk
upon
the
snow
with
great
firmness
and
security
we
were
followed
by
the
mules
and
though
they
are
very
animals
and
were
for
the
occasion
they
stumbled
and
fell
very
often
the
ice
being
so
hard
that
the
nails
in
their
shoes
could
not
penetrate
having
reached
the
top
of
this
mountain
from
whence
there
is
no
prospect
but
of
other
rocks
and
mountains
we
prepared
for
descending
on
the
other
side
by
the
leze
which
is
an
occasional
sledge
made
of
two
pieces
of
wood
carried
up
by
the
coulants
for
this
purpose
i
did
not
much
relish
this
kind
of
carriage
especially
as
the
mountain
was
very
steep
and
covered
with
such
a
thick
fog
that
we
could
hardly
see
two
or
three
yards
before
us
nevertheless
our
guides
were
so
confident
and
my
companion
who
had
passed
the
same
way
on
other
occasions
was
so
secure
that
i
ventured
to
place
myself
on
this
machine
one
of
the
coulants
standing
behind
me
and
the
other
sitting
before
as
the
conductor
with
his
feet
paddling
among
the
snow
in
order
to
moderate
the
velocity
of
its
descent
thus
accommodated
we
descended
the
mountain
with
such
rapidity
that
in
an
hour
we
reached
limon
which
is
the
native
place
of
almost
all
the
muleteers
who
transport
merchandize
from
nice
to
coni
and
turin
here
we
waited
full
two
hours
for
the
mules
which
travelled
with
the
servants
by
the
common
road
to
each
of
the
coulants
we
paid
forty
sols
which
are
nearly
equal
to
two
shillings
sterling
leaving
limon
we
were
in
two
hours
quite
disengaged
from
the
gorges
of
the
mountains
which
are
partly
covered
with
wood
and
pasturage
though
altogether
inaccessible
except
in
summer
but
from
the
foot
of
the
col
de
tende
the
road
lies
through
a
plain
all
the
way
to
turin
we
took
six
hours
to
travel
from
the
inn
where
we
had
lodged
over
the
mountain
to
limon
and
five
hours
from
thence
to
coni
here
we
found
our
baggage
which
we
had
sent
off
by
the
carriers
one
day
before
we
departed
from
nice
and
here
we
dismissed
our
guides
together
with
the
mules
in
winter
you
have
a
mule
for
this
whole
journey
at
the
rate
of
twenty
livres
and
the
guides
are
payed
at
the
rate
of
two
livres
a
day
reckoning
six
days
three
for
the
journey
to
coni
and
three
for
their
return
to
nice
we
set
out
so
early
in
the
morning
in
order
to
avoid
the
inconveniencies
and
dangers
that
attend
the
passage
of
this
mountain
the
first
of
these
arises
from
your
meeting
with
long
strings
of
loaded
mules
in
a
slippery
road
the
breadth
of
which
does
not
exceed
a
foot
and
an
half
as
it
is
altogether
impossible
for
two
mules
to
pass
each
other
in
such
a
narrow
path
the
muleteers
have
made
doublings
or
elbows
in
different
parts
and
when
the
troops
of
mules
meet
the
least
numerous
is
obliged
to
turn
off
into
one
of
these
doublings
and
there
halt
until
the
others
are
past
travellers
in
order
to
avoid
this
disagreeable
delay
which
is
the
more
vexatious
considering
the
excessive
cold
begin
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
early
in
the
morning
before
the
mules
quit
their
inns
but
the
great
danger
of
travelling
here
when
the
sun
is
up
proceeds
from
what
they
call
the
valanches
these
are
balls
of
snow
detached
from
the
mountains
which
the
road
either
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
or
the
humidity
of
the
weather
a
piece
of
snow
thus
loosened
from
the
rock
though
perhaps
not
above
three
or
four
feet
in
diameter
increases
sometimes
in
its
descent
to
such
a
degree
as
to
become
two
hundred
paces
in
length
and
rolls
down
with
such
rapidity
that
the
traveller
is
crushed
to
death
before
he
can
make
three
steps
on
the
road
these
dreadful
heaps
drag
every
thing
along
with
them
in
their
descent
they
tear
up
huge
trees
by
the
roots
and
if
they
chance
to
fall
upon
a
house
demolish
it
to
the
foundation
accidents
of
this
nature
seldom
happen
in
the
winter
while
the
weather
is
dry
and
yet
scarce
a
year
passes
in
which
some
mules
and
their
drivers
do
not
perish
by
the
valanches
at
coni
we
found
the
countess
c
from
nice
who
had
made
the
same
journey
in
a
chair
carried
by
porters
this
is
no
other
than
a
common
of
wood
with
a
straw
bottom
covered
above
with
waxed
cloth
to
protect
the
traveller
from
the
rain
or
snow
and
provided
with
a
upon
which
the
feet
rest
it
is
carried
like
a
and
for
this
purpose
six
or
eight
porters
are
employed
at
the
rate
of
three
or
four
livres
a
head
per
day
according
to
the
season
allowing
three
days
for
their
return
of
these
six
men
two
are
between
the
poles
carrying
like
common
chairmen
and
each
of
these
is
supported
by
the
other
two
one
at
each
hand
but
as
those
in
the
middle
sustain
the
greatest
burthen
they
are
relieved
by
the
others
in
a
regular
rotation
in
descending
the
mountain
they
carry
the
poles
on
their
shoulders
and
in
that
case
four
men
are
employed
one
at
each
end
at
coni
you
may
have
a
chaise
to
go
with
the
same
horses
to
turin
for
which
you
pay
fifteen
livres
and
are
a
day
and
a
half
on
the
way
you
may
post
it
however
in
one
day
and
then
the
price
is
seven
livres
ten
sols
per
post
and
ten
sols
to
the
postilion
the
method
we
took
was
that
of
cambiatura
this
is
a
chaise
with
horses
shifted
at
the
same
stages
that
are
used
in
posting
but
as
it
is
supposed
to
move
slower
we
pay
but
five
livres
per
post
and
ten
sols
to
the
postilion
in
order
to
quicken
its
pace
we
gave
ten
sols
extraordinary
to
each
postilion
and
for
this
gratification
he
drove
us
even
faster
than
the
post
the
chaises
are
like
those
of
italy
and
will
take
on
near
two
hundred

of
baggage
coni
is
situated
between
two
small
streams
and
though
neither
very
large
nor
populous
is
considerable
for
the
strength
of
its
fortifications
it
is
honoured
with
the
title
of
the
because
though
several
times
besieged
it
was
never
taken
the
prince
of
conti
invested
it
in
the
war
of
but
he
was
obliged
to
raise
the
siege
after
having
given
battle
to
the
king
of
sardinia
the
place
was
gallantly
defended
by
the
baron
leutrum
a
german
protestant
the
best
general
in
the
sardinian
service
but
what
contributed
most
to
the
miscarriage
of
the
enemy
was
a
long
tract
of
heavy
rains
which
destroyed
all
their
works
and
rendered
their
advances
impracticable
i
need
not
tell
you
that
piedmont
is
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
agreeable
countries
in
europe
and
this
the
most
agreeable
part
of
all
piedmont
though
it
now
appeared
to
disadvantage
from
the
rigorous
season
of
the
year
i
shall
only
observe
that
we
passed
through
sabellian
which
is
a
considerable
town
and
arrived
in
the
evening
at
turin
we
entered
this
fine
city
by
the
gate
of
nice
and
passing
through
the
elegant
piazza
di
san
carlo
took
up
our
quarters
at
the
bona
fama
which
stands
at
one
corner
of
the
great
square
called
la
piazza
castel
were
i
even
disposed
to
give
a
description
of
turin
i
should
be
obliged
to
postpone
it
till
another
opportunity
having
no
room
at
present
to
say
any
thing
more
but
that
i
am
always

may
dear
sir
i
am
thus
far
on
my
way
to
england
i
had
resolved
to
leave
nice
without
having
the
least
dispute
with
any
one
native
of
the
place
but
i
found
it
impossible
to
keep
this
resolution
my
landlord
c
a
man
of
fashion
with
whose
family
we
had
always
lived
in
friendship
was
so
reasonable
as
to
expect
i
should
give
him
up
the
house
and
garden
though
they
were
to
be
paid
for
till
michaelmas
and
peremptorily
declared
i
should
not
be
permitted
to
them
to
any
other
person
he
had
of
his
own
accord
assured
me
more
than
once
that
he
would
take
my
furniture
off
my
hands
and
trusting
to
this
assurance
i
had
lost
the
opportunity
of
disposing
it
to
advantage
but
when
the
time
of
my
departure
drew
near
he
refused
to
take
it
at
the
same
time
insisting
upon
having
the
key
of
the
house
and
garden
as
well
as
on
being
paid
the
whole
rent
directly
though
it
would
not
be
due
till
the
middle
of
september
i
was
so
exasperated
at
this
treatment
from
a
man
whom
i
had
cultivated
with
particular
respect
that
i
determined
to
contest
it
at
law
but
the
affair
was
accommodated
by
the
mediation
of
a
father
of
the
minims
a
friend
to
both
and
a
merchant
of
nice
who
charged
himself
with
the
care
of
the
house
and
furniture
a
stranger
must
conduct
himself
with
the
utmost
circumspection
to
be
able
to
live
among
these
people
without
being
the
dupe
of
imposition
i
had
sent
to
aix
for
a
coach
and
four
horses
which
i
hired
at
the
rate
of
eighteen
french
livres
a
day
being
equal
to
fifteen
shillings
and
sterling
the
river
var
was
so
swelled
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
on
the
mountains
as
to
be
impassable
by
any
and
therefore
the
coach
remained
at
antibes
to
which
we
went
by
water
the
distance
being
about
nine
or
ten
miles
this
is
the
antipolis
of
the
antients
said
to
have
been
built
like
nice
by
a
colony
from
marseilles
in
all
probability
however
it
was
later
than
the
foundation
of
nice
and
took
its
name
from
its
being
situated
directly
opposite
to
that
city
pliny
says
it
was
famous
for
its
and
to
this
circumstance
martial
alludes
in
the
following
lines
antipolitani

spawned
from

is
true
right
scomber
had
i
been
i
had
come
to
you
the
famous
pickle
garum
was
made
from
the
thynnus
or
tunny
as
well
as
from
the
scomber
but
that
from
the
scomber
was
counted
the
most
delicate
commentators
however
are
not
agreed
about
the
scomber
or
scombrus
some
suppose
it
was
the
herring
or
sprat
others
believe
it
was
the
mackarel
after
all
perhaps
it
was
the
anchovy
which
i
do
not
find
distinguished
by
any
other
latin
name
for
the
encrasicolus
is
a
greek
appellation
altogether
generical
those
who
would
be
further
informed
about
the
garum
and
the
scomber

at
present
antibes
is
the
frontier
of
france
towards
italy
pretty
strongly
fortified
and
garrisoned
by
a
battalion
of
soldiers
the
town
is
small
and
inconsiderable
but
the
basin
of
the
harbour
is
surrounded
to
seaward
by
a
curious
bulwark
founded
upon
piles
driven
in
the
water
consisting
of
a
wall
ramparts
casemates
and
quay
vessels
lie
very
safe
in
this
harbour
but
there
is
not
water
at
the
entrance
of
it
to
admit
of
ships
of
any
burthen
the
shallows
run
so
far
off
from
the
coast
that
a
ship
of
force
can
not
lie
near
enough
to
batter
the
town
but
it
was
bombarded
in
the
late
war
its
chief
strength
by
land
consists
in
a
small
quadrangular
fort
detached
from
the
body
of
the
place
which
in
a
particular
manner
commands
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
the
wall
of
the
town
built
in
the
sea
has
embrasures
and
salient
angles
on
which
a
great
number
of
cannon
may
be
mounted
i
think
the
adjacent
country
is
much
more
pleasant
than
that
on
the
side
of
nice
and
there
is
certainly
no
essential
difference
in
the
climate
the
ground
here
is
not
so
encumbered
it
is
laid
out
in
agreeable
inclosures
with
intervals
of
open
fields
and
the
mountains
rise
with
an
easy
ascent
at
a
much
greater
distance
from
the
sea
than
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
besides
here
are
charming
rides
along
the
beach
which
is
smooth
and
firm
when
we
passed
in
the
last
week
of
april
the
corn
was
in
the
ear
the
cherries
were
almost
ripe
and
the
figs
had
begun
to
blacken
i
had
embarked
my
heavy
baggage
on
board
a
london
ship
which
happened
to
be
at
nice
ready
to
sail
as
for
our
small
trunks
or
portmanteaus
which
we
carried
along
with
us
they
were
examined
at
antibes
but
the
ceremony
was
performed
very
superficially
in
consequence
of
tipping
the
searcher
with
which
is
a
wonderful
conciliator
at
all
the
bureaus
in
this
country
we
lay
at
cannes
a
neat
village
charmingly
situated
on
the
beach
of
the
mediterranean
exactly
opposite
to
the
isles
marguerites
where
are
confined
as
there
are
some
good
houses
in
this
place
i
would
rather
live
here
for
the
sake
of
the
mild
climate
than
either
at
antibes
or
nice
here
you
are
not
cooped
up
within
walls
nor
crowded
with
soldiers
and
people
but
are
already
in
the
country
enjoy
a
fine
air
and
are
well
supplied
with
all
sorts
of
fish
the
mountains
of
esterelles
which
in
one
of
my
former
letters
i
described
as
a
most
romantic
and
noble
plantation
of
trees
shrubs
and
aromatic
plants
is
at
present
quite
desolate
last
summer
some
execrable
villains
set
fire
to
the
pines
when
the
wind
was
high
it
continued
burning
for
several
months
and
the
conflagration
extended
above
ten
leagues
consuming
an
incredible
quantity
of
timber
the
ground
is
now
naked
on
each
side
of
the
road
or
occupied
by
the
black
trunks
of
the
trees
which
have
been
scorched
without
falling
they
stand
as
so
many
monuments
of
the
judgment
of
heaven
filling
the
mind
with
horror
and
compassion
i
could
hardly
refrain
from
shedding
tears
at
this
dismal
spectacle
when
i
recalled
the
idea
of
what
it
was
about
eighteen
months
ago
as
we
stayed
all
night
at
frejus
i
had
an
opportunity
of
viewing
the
amphitheatre
at
leisure
as
near
as
i
can
judge
by
the
eye
it
is
of
the
same
dimensions
with
that
of
nismes
but
shockingly
dilapidated
the
stone
seats
rising
from
the
arena
are
still
extant
and
the
cells
under
them
where
the
wild
beasts
were
kept
there
are
likewise
the
remains
of
two
galleries
one
over
another
and
two
vomitoria
or
great
gateways
at
opposite
sides
of
the
arena
which
is
now
a
fine
green
with
a
road
through
the
middle
of
it
but
all
the
external
architecture
and
the
ornaments
are
demolished
the
most
intire
part
of
the
wall
now
constitutes
part
of
a
monastery
the
monks
of
which
i
am
told
have
helped
to
destroy
the
amphitheatre
by
removing
the
stones
for
their
own
purposes
of
building
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
amphitheatre
which
stands
without
the
walls
are
the
vestiges
of
an
old
edifice
said
to
have
been
the
palace
where
the
imperator
or
president
resided
for
it
was
a
roman
colony
much
favoured
by
julius
caesar
who
gave
it
the
name
of
forum
julii
and
civitas
forojuliensis
in
all
probability
it
was
he
who
built
the
amphitheatre
and
brought
hither
the
water
ten
leagues
from
the
river
of
ciagne
by
means
of
an
aqueduct
some
arcades
of
which
are
still
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
a
great
number
of
statues
were
found
in
this
place
together
with
antient
inscriptions
which
have
been
published
by
different
authors
i
need
not
tell
you
that
julius
agricola
the
of
tacitus
the
historian
was
a
native
of
frejus
which
is
now
a
very
poor
inconsiderable
place
from
hence
the
country
opens
to
the
left
forming
an
extensive
plain
between
the
sea
and
the
mountains
which
are
a
continuation
of
the
alps
that
stretches
through
provence
and
dauphine
this
plain
watered
with
pleasant
streams
and
varied
with
vineyards
and
afforded
a
most
agreeable
prospect
to
our
eyes
which
were
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
scorching
sands
rugged
rocks
and
abrupt
mountains
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nice
although
this
has
much
the
appearance
of
a
i
am
told
it
does
not
produce
enough
for
the
consumption
of
its
inhabitants
who
are
obliged
to
have
annual
supplies
from
abroad
imported
at
marseilles
a
frenchman
at
an
average
eats
three
times
the
quantity
of
bread
that
satisfies
a
native
of
england
and
indeed
it
is
undoubtedly
the
staff
of
his
life
i
am
therefore
surprised
that
the
provencaux
do
not
convert
part
of
their
vineyards
into
for
they
may
boast
of
their
wine
as
they
please
but
that
which
is
drank
by
the
common
people
not
only
here
but
also
in
all
the
wine
countries
of
france
is
neither
so
strong
nourishing
nor
in
my
opinion
so
pleasant
to
the
taste
as
the
of
england
it
must
be
owned
that
all
the
peasants
who
have
wine
for
their
ordinary
drink
are
of
a
diminutive
size
in
comparison
of
those
who
use
milk
beer
or
even
water
and
it
is
a
constant
observation
that
when
there
is
a
scarcity
of
wine
the
common
people
are
always
more
healthy
than
in
those
seasons
when
it
abounds
the
longer
i
live
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
wine
and
all
fermented
liquors
are
pernicious
to
the
human
constitution
and
that
for
the
preservation
of
health
and
exhilaration
of
the
spirits
there
is
no
beverage
comparable
to
simple
water
between
luc
and
toulon
the
country
is
delightfully
parcelled
out
into
inclosures
here
is
plenty
of
rich
pasturage
for
black
cattle
and
a
greater
number
of
pure
streams
and
rivulets
than
i
have
observed
in
any
other
parts
of
france
toulon
is
a
considerable
place
even
exclusive
of
the
basin
docks
and
arsenal
which
indeed
are
such
as
justify
the
remark
made
by
a
stranger
when
he
viewed
them
the
king
of
france
said
he
is
greater
at
toulon
than
at
versailles
the
quay
the
jetties
the
docks
and
magazines
are
contrived
and
executed
with
precision
order
solidity
and
magnificence
i
counted
fourteen
ships
of
the
line
lying
unrigged
in
the
basin
besides
the
tonant
of
eighty
guns
which
was
in
dock
repairing
and
a
new
frigate
on
the
stocks
i
was
credibly
informed
that
in
the
last
war
the
king
of
france
was
so
with
cannon
for
his
navy
that
in
every
action
there
was
scarce
a
ship
which
had
not
several
pieces
burst
these
accidents
did
great
damage
and
discouraged
the
french
mariners
to
such
a
degree
that
they
became
more
afraid
of
their
own
guns
than
of
those
of
the
english
there
are
now
at
toulon
above
two
thousand
pieces
of
iron
cannon
unfit
for
service
this
is
an
undeniable
proof
of
the
weakness
and
neglect
of
the
french
administration
but
a
more
suprizing
proof
of
their
imbecility
is
the
state
of
the
fortifications
that
defend
the
entrance
of
this
very
harbour
i
have
some
reason
to
think
that
they
trusted
for
its
security
entirely
to
our
opinion
that
it
must
be
inaccessible
capt
e
of
one
of
our
frigates
lately
entered
the
harbour
with
a
contrary
wind
which
by
obliging
him
to
tack
afforded
an
opportunity
of
sounding
the
whole
breadth
and
length
of
the
passage
he
came
in
without
a
pilot
and
made
a
pretence
of
buying
cordage
or
some
other
stores
but
the
french
officers
were
much
chagrined
at
the
boldness
of
his
enterprize
they
alleged
that
he
came
for
no
other
reason
but
to
sound
the
channel
and
that
he
had
an
engineer
aboard
who
made
drawings
of
the
land
and
the
forts
their
bearings
and
distances
in
all
probability
these
suspicions
were
communicated
to
the
ministry
for
an
order
immediately
arrived
that
no
stranger
should
be
admitted
into
the
docks
and
arsenal
part
of
the
road
from
hence
to
marseilles
lies
through
a
vast
mountain
which
resembles
that
of
estrelles
but
is
not
so
well
covered
with
wood
though
it
has
the
advantage
of
an
agreeable
stream
running
through
the
bottom
i
was
much
pleased
with
marseilles
which
is
indeed
a
noble
city
large
populous
and
flourishing
the
streets
of
what
is
called
the
new
town
are
open
airy
and
spacious
the
houses
well
built
and
even
magnificent
the
harbour
is
an
oval
basin
surrounded
on
every
side
either
by
the
buildings
or
the
land
so
that
the
shipping
lies
perfectly
secure
and
here
is
generally
an
incredible
number
of
vessels
on
the
city
side
there
is
a
quay
of
which
extends
thirteen
hundred
paces
and
the
space
between
this
and
the
houses
that
front
it
is
continually
filled
with
a
surprising
crowd
of
people
the
gallies
to
the
number
of
eight
or
nine
are
moored
with
their
sterns
to
one
part
of
the
wharf
and
the
slaves
are
permitted
to
work
for
their
own
benefit
at
their
respective
occupations
in
little
shops
or
booths
which
they
rent
for
a
trifle
there
you
see
tradesmen
of
all
kinds
sitting
at
work
chained
by
one
foot
taylors
silversmiths
watch
and
barbers
jewellers
scriveners
booksellers
cutlers
and
all
manner
of
they
pay
about
two
sols
a
day
to
the
king
for
this
indulgence
live
well
and
look
jolly
and
can
afford
to
sell
their
goods
and
labour
much
cheaper
than
other
dealers
and
tradesmen
at
night
however
they
are
obliged
to
lie
aboard
notwithstanding
the
great
face
of
business
at
marseilles
their
trade
is
greatly
on
the
decline
and
their
merchants
are
failing
every
day
this
decay
of
commerce
is
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
the
english
who
at
the
peace
poured
in
such
a
quantity
of
european
merchandize
into
martinique
and
guadalupe
that
when
the
merchants
of
marseilles
sent
over
their
cargoes
they
found
the
markets
overstocked
and
were
obliged
to
sell
for
a
considerable
loss
besides
the
french
colonists
had
such
a
stock
of
sugars
coffee
and
other
commodities
lying
by
them
during
the
war
that
upon
the
first
notice
of
peace
they
shipped
them
off
in
great
quantities
for
marseilles
i
am
told
that
the
produce
of
the
islands
is
at
present
cheaper
here
than
where
it
grows
and
on
the
other
hand
the
merchandize
of
this
country
sells
for
less
money
at
martinique
than
in
provence
a
single
person
who
travels
in
this
country
may
live
at
a
reasonable
rate
in
these
towns
by
eating
at
the
public
ordinaries
but
i
would
advise
all
families
that
come
hither
to
make
any
stay
to
take
furnished
lodgings
as
soon
as
they
can
for
the
expence
of
living
at
an
hotel
is
enormous
i
was
obliged
to
pay
at
marseilles
four
livres
a
head
for
every
meal
and
half
that
price
for
my
servant
and
was
charged
six
livres
a
day
besides
for
the
apartment
so
that
our
daily
expence
including
breakfast
and
a
valet
de
place
amounted
to
two
the
same
imposition
prevails
all
over
the
south
of
france
though
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
the
cheapest
and
most
plentiful
part
of
the
kingdom
without
all
doubt
it
must
be
owing
to
the
folly
and
extravagance
of
english
travellers
who
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
fleeced
without
wincing
until
this
extortion
is
become
authorized
by
custom
it
is
very
disagreeable
riding
in
the
avenues
of
marseilles
because
you
are
confined
in
a
dusty
high
road
crouded
with
carriages
and
beasts
of
burden
between
two
white
walls
the
reflection
from
which
while
the
sun
shines
is
intolerable
but
in
this
neighbourhood
there
is
a
vast
number
of
pleasant
called
bastides
said
to
amount
to
twelve
thousand
some
of
which
may
be
rented
ready
furnished
at
a
very
reasonable
price
marseilles
is
a
gay
city
and
the
inhabitants
indulge
themselves
in
a
variety
of
amusements
they
have
assemblies
a
concert
spirituel
and
a
comedy
here
is
also
a
spacious
cours
or
walk
shaded
with
trees
to
which
in
the
evening
there
is
a
great
resort
of
people
marseilles
being
a
free
port
there
is
a
bureau
about
half
a
league
from
the
city
on
the
road
to
aix
where
all
carriages
undergo
examination
and
if
any
thing
contraband
is
found
the
vehicle
baggage
and
even
the
horses
are
confiscated
we
escaped
this
disagreeable
ceremony
by
the
sagacity
of
our
driver
of
his
own
accord
he
declared
at
the
bureau
that
we
had
bought
a
pound
of
coffee
and
some
sugar
at
marseilles
and
were
ready
to
pay
the
duty
which
amounted
to
about
ten
sols
they
took
the
money
gave
him
a
receipt
and
let
the
carriage
pass
without
further
question
i
proposed
to
stay
one
night
only
at
aix
but
a
r
who
is
here
had
found
such
benefit
from
drinking
the
waters
that
i
was
persuaded
to
make
trial
of
them
for
eight
or
ten
days
i
have
accordingly
taken
private
lodgings
and
drank
them
at
the
not
without
finding
considerable
benefit
in
my
next
i
shall
say
something
further
of
these
waters
though
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
prove
a
source
of
much
entertainment
it
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
find
them
contribute
in
any
degree
to
the
health

surprizing

scorbutical

these
disorders
i
could
not
but
in
justice
to
myself
try
the
united
efforts
of
the
air

the

some
of
our
english

complain
that
when

presented
to

they
met
with
a
very
cold
reception
the
french
as

foreigners
have
no
idea
of
a
man
of
family
and
fashion
without
the
title

where
an
english

situated
in
a

almost
surrounded
by

which
however
do
not
screen
it
from
the
bize
or
north
wind
that
blows
extremely
sharp
in
the
winter
and
spring
rendering
the
air
almost
insupportably
cold
and
very
dangerous
to
those
who
have
some
kinds
of
pulmonary
complaints
such
as
tubercules
abscesses
or
spitting
of
blood
lord
h
who
passed
part
of
last
winter
in
this
place
afflicted
with
some
of
these
symptoms
grew
worse
every
day
while
he
continued
at
aix
but
he
no
sooner
removed
to
marseilles
than
all
his
complaints
abated
such
a
difference
there
is
in
the
air
of
these
two
places
though
the
distance
between
them
does
not
exceed
ten
or
twelve
miles
but
the
air
of
marseilles
though
much
more
mild
than
that
of
aix
in
the
winter
is
not
near
so
warm
as
the
climate
of
nice
where
we
find
in
plenty
such
flowers
fruit
and
vegetables
even
in
the
severest
season
as
will
not
grow
and
ripen
either
at
marseilles
or
toulon
if
the
air
of
aix
is
disagreeably
cold
in
the
winter
it
is
rendered
quite
insufferable
in
the
summer
from
excessive
heat
occasioned
by
the
reflexion
from
the
rocks
and
mountains
which
at
the
same
time
obstruct
the
circulation
of
air
for
it
must
be
observed
that
the
same
mountains
which
serve
as
funnels
and
canals
to
collect
and
discharge
the
keen
blasts
of
winter
will
provide
screens
to
intercept
intirely
the
faint
breezes
of
summer
aix
though
pretty
well
provided
with
butcher
meat
is
very
ill
supplied
with
potherbs
and
they
have
no
poultry
but
what
comes
at
a
vast
distance
from
the
lionnois
they
say
their
want
of
roots
cabbage
cauliflower
etc
is
owing
to
a
scarcity
of
water
but
the
truth
is
they
are
very
bad
gardeners
their
oil
is
good
and
cheap
their
wine
is
indifferent
but
their
chief
care
seems
employed
on
the
culture
of
silk
the
staple
of
provence
which
is
every
where
shaded
with
plantations
of
mulberry
trees
for
the
nourishment
of
the
worms
notwithstanding
the
boasted
cheapness
of
every
article
of
housekeeping
in
the
south
of
france
i
am
persuaded
a
family
may
live
for
less
money
at
york
durham
hereford
and
in
many
other
cities
of
england
than
at
aix
in
provence
keep
a
more
plentiful
table
and
be
much
more
comfortably
situated
in
all
respects
i
found
lodging
and
provision
at
aix
fifty
per
cent
dearer
than
at
montpellier
which
is
counted
the
dearest
place
in
languedoc
the
baths
of
aix
so
famous
in
antiquity
were
quite
demolished
by
the
irruptions
of
the
barbarians
the
very
source
of
the
water
was
lost
till
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
i
think
the
year
when
it
was
discovered
by
accident
in
digging
for
the
foundation
of
a
house
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
just
without
the
city
wall
near
the
same
place
was
found
a
small
stone
altar
with
the
figure
of
a
priapus
and
some
letters
in
capitals
which
the
antiquarians
have
differently
interpreted
from
this
figure
it
was
supposed
that
the
waters
were
efficacious
in
cases
of
barrenness
it
was
a
long
time
however
before
any
person
would
venture
to
use
them
internally
as
it
did
not
appear
that
they
had
ever
been
drank
by
the
antients
on
their
they
were
chiefly
used
for
baths
to
horses
and
other
beasts
which
had
the
mange
and
other
cutaneous
eruptions
at
length
poor
people
began
to
bathe
in
them
for
the
same
disorders
and
received
such
benefit
from
them
as
attracted
the
attention
of
more
curious
inquirers
a
very
superficial
and
imperfect
analysis
was
made
and
published
with
a
few
remarkable
histories
of
the
cures
they
had
performed
by
three
different
physicians
of
those
days
and
those
little
treatises
i
suppose
encouraged
valetudinarians
to
drink
them
without
ceremony
they
were
found
serviceable
in
the
gout
the
gravel
scurvy
dropsy
palsy
indigestion
asthma
and
consumption
and
their
fame
soon
extended
itself
all
over
languedoc
gascony
dauphine
and
provence
the
magistrates
with
a
view
to
render
them
more
useful
and
commodious
have
raised
a
plain
building
in
which
there
are
a
couple
of
private
baths
with
a
bedchamber
adjoining
to
each
where
individuals
may
use
them
both
internally
and
externally
for
a
moderate
expence
these
baths
are
paved
with
marble
and
supplied
with
water
each
by
a
large
brass
cock
which
you
can
turn
at
pleasure
at
one
end
of
this
edifice
there
is
an
octagon
open
at
top
having
a
bason
with
a
stone
pillar
in
the
middle
which
discharges
water
from
the
same
source
all
round
by
eight
small
brass
cocks
and
hither
people
of
all
ranks
come
of
a
morning
with
their
glasses
to
drink
the
water
or
wash
their
sores
or
subject
their
contracted
limbs
to
the
stream
this
last
operation
called
the
douche
however
is
more
effectually
undergone
in
the
private
bath
where
the
stream
is
much
more
powerful
the
natural
warmth
of
this
water
as
nearly
as
i
can
judge
from
recollection
is
about
the
same
degree
of
temperature
with
that
in
the
queen
bath
at
bath
in
somersetshire
it
is
perfectly
transparent
sparkling
in
the
glass
light
and
agreeable
to
the
taste
and
may
be
drank
without
any
preparation
to
the
quantity
of
three
or
four
pints
at
a
time
there
are
many
people
at
aix
who
swallow
fourteen
half
pint
glasses
every
morning
during
the
season
which
is
in
the
month
of
may
though
it
may
be
taken
with
equal
benefit
all
the
year
round
it
has
no
sensible
operation
but
by
urine
an
effect
which
pure
water
would
produce
if
drank
in
the
same
quantity
if
we
may
believe
those
who
have
published
their
experiments
this
water
produces
neither
agitation
cloud
or
change
of
colour
when
mixed
with
acids
alkalies
tincture
of
galls
syrup
of
violets
or
solution
of
silver
the
residue
after
boiling
evaporation
and
filtration
affords
a
very
small
proportion
of
purging
salt
and
calcarious
earth
which
last
ferments
with
strong
acids
as
i
had
neither
hydrometer
nor
thermometer
to
ascertain
the
weight
and
warmth
of
this
water
nor
time
to
procure
the
proper
utensils
to
make
the
preparations
and
repeat
the
experiments
necessary
to
exhibit
a
complete
analysis
i
did
not
pretend
to
enter
upon
this
process
but
contented
myself
with
drinking
bathing
and
using
the
douche
which
perfectly
answered
my
expectation
having
in
eight
days
almost
cured
an
ugly
scorbutic
tetter
which
had
for
some
time
deprived
me
of
the
use
of
my
right
hand
i
observed
that
the
water
when
used
externally
left
always
a
kind
of
oily
appearance
on
the
skin
that
when
we
boiled
it
at
home
in
an
earthen
pot
the
steams
smelled
like
those
of
sulphur
and
even
affected
my
lungs
in
the
same
manner
but
the
bath
itself
smelled
strong
of
a
the
water
after
standing
all
night
in
a
bottle
yielded
a
remarkably
vinous
taste
and
odour
something
analogous
to
that
of
dulcified
spirit
of
nitre
whether
the
active
particles
consist
of
a
volatile
vitriol
or
a
very
fine
petroleum
or
a
mixture
of
both
i
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
but
the
best
way
i
know
of
discovering
whether
it
is
really
impregnated
with
a
vitriolic
principle
too
subtil
and
fugitive
for
the
usual
operations
of
chymistry
is
to
place
bottles
filled
with
wine
in
the
bath
or
adjacent
room
which
wine
if
there
is
really
a
volatile
acid
in
any
considerable
quantity
will
be
pricked
in
eight
and
forty
hours
having
ordered
our
coach
to
be
refitted
and
provided
with
fresh
horses
as
well
as
with
another
postilion
in
consequence
of
which
improvements
i
payed
at
the
rate
of
a
per
diem
to
lyons
and
back
again
we
departed
from
aix
and
the
second
day
of
our
journey
passing
the
durance
in
a
boat
lay
at
avignon
this
river
the
druentia
of
the
antients
is
a
considerable
stream
extremely
rapid
which
descends
from
the
mountains
and
discharges
itself
in
the
rhone
after
violent
rains
it
extends
its
channel
so
as
to
be
impassable
and
often
overflows
the
country
to
a
great
extent
in
the
middle
of
a
plain
betwixt
orgon
and
this
river
we
met
the
coach
in
which
we
had
travelled
eighteen
months
before
from
lyons
to
montpellier
conducted
by
our
old
driver
joseph
who
no
sooner
recognized
my
servant
at
a
distance
by
his
musquetoon
than
he
came
running
towards
our
carriage
and
seizing
my
hand
even
shed
tears
of
joy
joseph
had
been
travelling
through
spain
and
was
so
imbrowned
by
the
sun
that
he
might
have
passed
for
an
iroquois
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
marks
of
gratitude
which
the
poor
fellow
expressed
towards
his
benefactors
he
had
some
private
conversation
with
our
voiturier
whose
name
was
claude
to
whom
he
gave
such
a
favourable
character
of
us
as
in
all
probability
induced
him
to
be
wonderfully
obliging
during
the
whole
journey
you
know
avignon
is
a
large
city
belonging
to
the
pope
it
was
the
avenio
cavarum
of
the
antients
and
changed
masters
several
times
belonging
successively
to
the
romans
burgundians
franks
the
kingdom
of
arles
the
counts
of
provence
and
the
sovereigns
of
naples
it
was
sold
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
queen
jane
of
naples
to
pope
clement
vi
for
the
sum
of
eighty
thousand
florins
and
since
that
period
has
continued
under
the
dominion
of
the
see
of
rome
not
but
that
when
the
duc
de
crequi
the
french
ambassador
was
insulted
at
rome
in
the
year
the
parliament
of
provence
passed
an
arret
declaring
the
city
of
avignon
and
the
county
venaiss
in
part
of
the
ancient
domain
of
provence
and
therefore
reunited
it
to
the
crown
of
france
which
accordingly
took
possession
though
it
was
afterwards
restored
to
the
roman
see
at
the
peace
of
pisa
the
pope
however
holds
it
by
a
precarious
title
at
the
mercy
of
the
french
king
who
may
one
day
be
induced
to
resume
it
upon
payment
of
the
original
as
a
succession
of
popes
resided
here
for
the
space
of
seventy
years
the
city
could
not
fail
to
be
adorned
with
a
great
number
of
magnificent
churches
and
convents
which
are
richly
embellished
with
painting
sculpture
shrines
reliques
and
tombs
among
the
last
is
that
of
the
celebrated
laura
whom
petrarch
has
immortalized
by
his
poetry
and
for
whom
francis
of
france
took
the
trouble
to
write
an
epitaph
avignon
is
governed
by
a
from
the
pope
and
the
police
of
the
city
is
regulated
by
the
consuls
it
is
a
large
place
situated
in
a
fruitful
plain
surrounded
by
high
walls
built
of
hewn
stone
which
on
the
west
side
are
washed
by
the
rhone
here
was
a
noble
bridge
over
the
river
but
it
is
now
in
ruins
on
the
other
side
a
branch
of
the
sorgue
runs
through
part
of
the
city
this
is
the
river
anciently
called
sulga
formed
by
the
famous
fountain
of
vaucluse
in
this
neighbourhood
where
the
poet
petrarch
resided
it
is
a
charming
transparent
stream
abounding
with
excellent
trout
and
we
passed
over
it
on
a
stone
bridge
in
our
way
to
orange
the
arausio
cavarum
of
the
romans
still
distinguished
by
some
noble
monuments
of
antiquity
these
consist
of
a
circus
an
aqueduct
a
temple
and
a
triumphal
arch
which
last
was
erected
in
honour
of
caius
marius
and
luctatius
catulus
after
the
great
victory
they
obtained
in
this
country
over
the
cimbri
and
teutones
it
is
a
very
magnificent
edifice
adorned
on
all
sides
with
trophies
and
battles
in
basso
relievo
the
ornaments
of
the
architecture
and
the
sculpture
are
wonderfully
elegant
for
the
time
in
which
it
was
erected
and
the
whole
is
surprisingly
well
preserved
considering
its
great
antiquity
it
seems
to
me
to
be
as
entire
and
perfect
as
the
arch
of
septimius
severus
at
rome
next
day
we
passed
two
very
impetuous
streams
the
drome
and
the
isere
the
first
which
very
much
resembles
the
var
we
forded
but
the
isere
we
crossed
in
a
boat
which
as
well
as
that
upon
the
durance
is
managed
by
the
traille
a
moveable
or
running
pulley
on
a
rope
stretched
between
two
wooden
machines
erected
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
river
the
contrivance
is
simple
and
effectual
and
the
passage
equally
safe
and
expeditious
the
boatman
has
nothing
to
do
but
by
means
of
a
long
massy
rudder
to
keep
the
head
obliquely
to
the
stream
the
force
of
which
pushes
the
boat
along
the
block
to
which
it
is
fixed
sliding
upon
the
rope
from
one
side
to
the
other
all
these
rivers
take
their
rise
from
the
mountains
which
are
continued
through
provence
and
dauphine
and
fall
into
the
rhone
and
all
of
them
when
swelled
by
sudden
rains
overflow
the
flat
country
although
dauphine
affords
little
or
no
oil
it
produces
excellent
wines
particularly
those
of
hermitage
and
the
first
of
these
is
sold
on
the
spot
for
three
livres
the
bottle
and
the
other
for
two
the
country
likewise
yields
a
considerable
quantity
of
corn
and
a
good
deal
of
grass
it
is
well
watered
with
streams
and
agreeably
shaded
with
wood
the
weather
was
pleasant
and
we
had
a
continued
song
of
nightingales
from
aix
to
fontainebleau
i
can
not
pretend
to
specify
the
antiquities
of
vienne
antiently
called
vienna
allobrogum
it
was
a
roman
colony
and
a
considerable
city
which
the
antients
spared
no
pains
and
expence
to
embellish
it
is
still
a
large
town
standing
among
several
hills
on
the
banks
of
the
rhone
though
all
its
former
splendor
is
eclipsed
its
commerce
decayed
and
most
of
its
antiquities
are
buried
in
ruins
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
vie
was
undoubtedly
a
temple
on
the
left
of
the
road
as
you
enter
it
by
the
gate
of
avignon
there
is
a
handsome
obelisk
or
rather
pyramid
about
thirty
feet
high
raised
upon
a
vault
supported
by
four
pillars
of
the
tuscan
order
it
is
certainly
a
roman
work
and
montfaucon
supposes
it
to
be
a
tomb
as
he
perceived
an
oblong
stone
jetting
out
from
the
middle
of
the
vault
in
which
the
ashes
of
the
defunct
were
probably
contained
the
story
of
pontius
pilate
who
is
said
to
have
ended
his
days
in
this
place
is
a
fable
on
the
seventh
day
of
our
journey
from
aix
we
arrived
at
lyons
where
i
shall
take
my
leave
of
you
for
the
present
being
with
great
truth
yours
etc
letter
xli
boulogne
june
dear
sir
i
am
at
last
in
a
situation
to
indulge
my
view
with
a
sight
of
britain
after
an
absence
of
two
years
and
indeed
you
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
i
feel
while
i
survey
the
white
cliffs
of
dover
at
this
distance
not
that
i
am
at
all
affected
by
the
nescia
qua
dulcedine
natalis
soli
of
horace
that
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
fanaticism
founded
on
the
prejudices
of
education
which
induces
a
laplander
to
place
the
terrestrial
paradise
among
the
snows
of
norway
and
a
swiss
to
prefer
the
barren
mountains
of
solleure
to
the
fruitful
plains
of
lombardy
i
am
attached
to
my
country
because
it
is
the
land
of
liberty
cleanliness
and
convenience
but
i
love
it
still
more
tenderly
as
the
scene
of
all
my
interesting
connexions
as
the
habitation
of
my
friends
for
whose
conversation
correspondence
and
esteem
i
wish
alone
to
live
our
journey
hither
from
lyons
produced
neither
accident
nor
adventure
worth
notice
but
abundance
of
little
vexations
which
may
be
termed
the
plagues
of
posting
at
lyons
where
we
stayed
only
a
few
days
i
found
a
which
i
hired
to
paris
for
six
it
was
a
fine
roomy
carriage
elegantly
furnished
and
made
for
travelling
so
strong
and
solid
in
all
its
parts
that
there
was
no
danger
of
its
being
shaken
to
pieces
by
the
roughness
of
the
road
but
its
weight
and
solidity
occasioned
so
much
friction
between
the
wheels
and
the
that
we
ran
the
risque
of
being
set
on
fire
three
or
four
times
a
day
upon
a
just
comparison
of
all
circumstances
posting
is
much
more
easy
convenient
and
reasonable
in
england
than
in
france
the
english
carriages
horses
harness
and
roads
are
much
better
and
the
postilions
more
obliging
and
alert
the
reason
is
plain
and
obvious
if
i
am
at
the
in
england
i
can
be
accommodated
elsewhere
the
publicans
on
the
road
are
sensible
of
this
and
therefore
they
vie
with
each
other
in
giving
satisfaction
to
travellers
but
in
france
where
the
post
is
monopolized
the
and
postilions
knowing
that
the
traveller
depends
intirely
upon
them
are
the
more
negligent
and
remiss
in
their
duty
as
well
as
the
more
encouraged
to
insolence
and
imposition
indeed
the
stranger
seems
to
be
left
intirely
at
the
mercy
of
those
fellows
except
in
large
towns
where
he
may
have
recourse
to
the
magistrate
or
commanding
officer
the
post
stands
very
often
by
itself
in
a
lone
country
situation
or
in
a
paultry
village
where
the
is
the
principal
inhabitant
and
in
such
a
case
if
you
should
be
by
being
supplied
with
bad
horses
if
you
should
be
delayed
on
frivolous
pretences
in
order
to
extort
money
if
the
postilions
should
drive
at
a
waggon
pace
with
a
view
to
provoke
your
impatience
or
should
you
in
any
shape
be
insulted
by
them
or
their
masters
and
i
know
not
any
redress
you
can
have
except
by
a
formal
complaint
to
the
comptroller
of
the
posts
who
is
generally
one
of
the
ministers
of
state
and
pays
little
or
no
regard
to
any
such
representations
i
know
an
english
gentleman
the
brother
of
an
earl
who
wrote
a
letter
of
complaint
to
the
duc
de
villars
governor
of
provence
against
the
of
antibes
who
had
insulted
and
imposed
upon
him
the
duke
answered
his
letter
promising
to
take
order
that
the
grievance
should
be
redressed
and
never
thought
of
it
after
another
great
inconvenience
which
attends
posting
in
france
is
that
if
you
are
retarded
by
any
accident
you
can
not
in
many
parts
of
the
kingdom
find
a
lodging
without
perhaps
travelling
two
or
three
posts
farther
than
you
would
choose
to
go
to
the
prejudice
of
your
health
and
even
the
hazard
of
your
life
whereas
on
any
part
of
the
in
england
you
will
meet
with
tolerable
accommodation
at
every
stage
through
the
whole
south
of
france
except
in
large
cities
the
inns
are
cold
damp
dark
dismal
and
dirty
the
landlords
equally
disobliging
and
rapacious
the
servants
aukward
sluttish
and
slothful
and
the
postilions
lazy
lounging
greedy
and
impertinent
if
you
chide
them
for
lingering
they
will
continue
to
delay
you
the
longer
if
you
chastise
them
with
sword
cane
cudgel
or
they
will
either
disappear
entirely
and
leave
you
without
resource
or
they
will
find
means
to
take
vengeance
by
overturning
your
carriage
the
best
method
i
know
of
travelling
with
any
degree
of
comfort
is
to
allow
yourself
to
become
the
dupe
of
imposition
and
stimulate
their
endeavours
by
extraordinary
gratifications
i
laid
down
a
resolution
and
kept
it
to
give
no
more
than
four
and
twenty
sols
per
post
between
the
two
postilions
but
i
am
now
persuaded
that
for
a
post
more
i
should
have
been
much
better
served
and
should
have
performed
the
journey
with
much
greater
pleasure
we
met
with
no
adventures
upon
the
road
worth
reciting
the
first
day
we
were
retarded
about
two
hours
by
the
dutchess
d
lle
and
her
son
the
duc
de
r
f
t
who
by
virtue
of
an
order
from
the
minister
had
anticipated
all
the
horses
at
the
post
they
accosted
my
servant
and
asked
if
his
master
was
a
lord
he
thought
proper
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
upon
which
the
duke
declared
that
he
must
certainly
be
of
french
extraction
inasmuch
as
he
observed
the
lilies
of
france
in
his
arms
on
the
coach
this
young
nobleman
spoke
a
little
english
he
asked
whence
we
had
come
and
understanding
we
had
been
in
italy
desired
to
know
whether
the
man
liked
france
or
italy
best
upon
his
giving
france
the
preference
he
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
he
was
a
lad
of
good
taste
the
dutchess
asked
if
her
son
spoke
english
well
and
seemed
mightily
pleased
when
my
man
assured
her
he
did
they
were
much
more
free
and
condescending
with
my
servant
than
with
myself
for
though
we
saluted
them
in
passing
and
were
even
supposed
to
be
persons
of
quality
they
did
not
open
their
lips
while
we
stood
close
by
them
at
the
till
their
horses
were
changed
they
were
going
to
geneva
and
their
equipage
consisted
of
three
coaches
and
six
with
five
domestics
the
dutchess
was
a
tall
thin
woman
with
her
head
close
shaved
this
delay
obliged
us
to
lie
two
posts
short
of
macon
at
a
solitary
auberge
called
maison
blanche
which
had
nothing
white
about
it
but
the
name
the
lionnois
is
one
of
the
most
agreeable
and
countries
i
ever
beheld
diversified
with
hill
dale
wood
and
water
laid
out
in
extensive
and
rich
meadows
well
stocked
with
black
cattle
and
adorned
with
a
surprising
number
of
towns
villages
villas
and
convents
generally
situated
on
the
brows
of
gently
swelling
hills
so
that
they
appear
to
the
greatest
advantage
what
contributes
in
a
great
measure
to
the
beauty
of
this
and
the
maconnois
is
the
charming
pastoral
soame
which
from
the
city
of
chalons
winds
its
silent
course
so
smooth
and
gentle
that
one
can
scarce
discern
which
way
its
current
flows
it
is
this
placid
appearance
that
tempts
so
many
people
to
bathe
in
it
at
lions
where
a
good
number
of
individuals
are
drowned
every
summer
whereas
there
is
no
instance
of
any
persons
thus
perishing
in
the
rhone
the
rapidity
of
it
deterring
every
body
from
bathing
in
its
stream
next
night
we
passed
at
beaune
where
we
found
nothing
good
but
the
wine
for
which
we
paid
forty
sols
the
bottle
at
chalons
our
took
fire
an
accident
which
detained
us
so
long
that
it
was
ten
before
we
arrived
at
auxerre
where
we
lay
in
all
probability
we
must
have
lodged
in
the
coach
had
not
we
been
content
to
take
four
horses
and
pay
for
six
two
posts
successively
the
alternative
was
either
to
proceed
with
four
on
those
terms
or
stay
till
the
other
horses
should
come
in
and
be
refreshed
in
such
an
emergency
i
would
advise
the
traveller
to
put
up
with
the
four
and
he
will
find
the
postilions
so
much
upon
their
mettle
that
those
stages
will
be
performed
sooner
than
the
others
in
which
you
have
the
full
complement
there
was
an
english
gentleman
laid
up
at
auxerre
with
a
broken
arm
to
whom
i
sent
my
compliments
with
offers
of
service
but
his
servant
told
my
man
that
he
did
not
choose
to
see
any
company
and
had
no
occasion
for
my
service
this
sort
of
reserve
seems
peculiar
to
the
english
disposition
when
two
natives
of
any
other
country
chance
to
meet
abroad
they
run
into
each
other
embrace
like
old
friends
even
though
they
have
never
heard
of
one
another
till
that
moment
whereas
two
englishmen
in
the
same
situation
maintain
a
mutual
reserve
and
diffidence
and
keep
without
the
sphere
of
each
other
attraction
like
two
bodies
endowed
with
a
repulsive
power
we
only
stopped
to
change
horses
at
dijon
the
capital
of
burgundy
which
is
a
venerable
old
city
but
we
passed
part
of
a
day
at
sens
and
visited
a
manufacture
of
that
stuff
we
call
manchester
velvet
which
is
here
made
and
dyed
to
great
perfection
under
the
direction
of
english
workmen
who
have
been
seduced
from
their
own
country
at
fontainebleau
we
went
to
see
the
palace
or
as
it
is
called
the
castle
which
though
an
irregular
pile
of
building
affords
a
great
deal
of
lodging
and
contains
some
very
noble
apartments
particularly
the
hall
of
audience
with
the
king
and
queen
chambers
upon
which
the
ornaments
of
carving
and
gilding
are
lavished
with
profusion
rather
than
propriety
here
are
some
rich
parterres
of
and
a
noble
orangerie
which
however
we
did
not
greatly
admire
after
having
lived
among
the
natural
orange
groves
of
italy
hitherto
we
had
enjoyed
fine
summer
weather
and
i
found
myself
so
well
that
i
imagined
my
health
was
intirely
restored
but
betwixt
fontainebleau
and
paris
we
were
overtaken
by
a
black
storm
of
rain
sleet
and
hail
which
seemed
to
reinstate
winter
in
all
its
rigour
for
the
cold
weather
continues
to
this
day
there
was
no
resisting
this
attack
i
caught
cold
immediately
and
this
was
reinforced
at
paris
where
i
stayed
but
three
days
the
same
man
pascal
sellier
rue
guenegaud
fauxbourg
germain
who
owned
the
coach
that
brought
us
from
lyons
supplied
me
with
a
returned
berline
to
boulogne
for
six
and
we
came
hither
by
easy
journeys
the
first
night
we
lodged
at
breteuil
where
we
found
an
elegant
inn
and
very
good
accommodation
but
the
next
we
were
forced
to
take
up
our
quarters
at
the
house
where
we
had
formerly
passed
a
very
disagreeable
night
at
abbeville
i
am
now
in
tolerable
lodging
where
i
shall
remain
a
few
weeks
merely
for
the
sake
of
a
little
repose
then
i
shall
gladly
tempt
that
invidious
straight
which
still
divides
you
from
yours

short
notes
on
one
or
two
unfamiliar
words
which
smollett
helped
to
domesticate
in
england
berline
swift
and
chesterfield
both
use
this
for
a
heavy
coach
the
most
famous
berline
was
that
used
in
the
flight
to
varennes
the
name
came
from
brandenburg
in
the
time
of
frederick
william
bize
smollett
spelling
of
bise
the
cutting
wind
which
makes
geneva
so
beautiful
but
intolerable
in
the
winter
a
tray
for
hot
charcoal
used
for
warming
rooms
at
nice
smollett
practically
introduced
this
word
dried
olives
were
often
used
as
fuel
calesse
calash
caleche
a
low
carriage
of
light
construction
with
a
movable
folding
hood
hence
applied
to
a
hood
bonnet
as
in
gaskell
cranford
cassine
latin
casa
cassa
cassina
the
italian
cassina
a
small
detached
house
in
the
fields
often
whitewashed
and
of
mean
appearance
smollett
uses
the
word
as
an
equivalent
for
summer
cottage
cf
bastide
as
used
by
dumas
cabane
has
practically
replaced
cassine
in
modern
french
see
letter
xxiv
cambiatura
the
system
of
changing
chaises
every
post
common
in
england
but
unusual
abroad
except
in
tuscany
cicisbeo
the
word
is
used
by
lady
mary
montagu
in
her
letters
as
cecisbeo
smollett
best
account
is
in
letter
xvii
see
introduction
xliii
conversazione
gray
uses
the
word
for
assembly
in
but
smollett
i
believe
is
about
the
first
englishman
to
define
it
properly
corinth
this
was
still
used
as
a
variant
of
currant
though
adherence
to
it
was
probably
rather
pedantic
on
smollett
part
cf
his
use
of
hough
for
hoe
boswell
uses
the
modern
form
corridore
this
word
was
used
by
evelyn
and
the
correct
modern
spelling
given
by
johnson
in
but
smollett
as
often
adheres
to
the
old
form
douche
italian
doccia
smollett
is
perhaps
the
first
writer
to
explain
the
word
and
assign
to
it

now
familiar
french
form

feluca
