not

understand
romanism
as
you
never
did
but
you
will
find
many
new
reasons
to
be
more
than

and
devoted
even
to
death

americans
you
are
sleeping
on
a
volcano
and
you
do
not
suspect
it
you
are
pressing
on
your
bosom
a
viper
which
will
bite
you
to
death
and
you
do
not
know
it
read
this
book
and
you
will
see
that
rome
is
the
sworn
the
most
implacable
the
absolutely
irreconcilable
and
deadly
enemy
of
your
schools
your
institutions
your
so
dearly
bought
rights
and
liberties
read
this
book
and
you
will
not
only
understand
that
it
is
to
rome
you
owe
the
rivers
of
blood
and
the
unspeakable
horrors
of
the
last
civil
war
but
you
will
learn
that
romanism
and
liberty
can
not
live
on
the
same
ground
this
has
been
declared
by
the
popes
hundreds
of
times
read
this
book
and
you
will
not
only
see
that
abraham
lincoln
was
murdered
by
rome
but
you
will
learn
that
romanism
under
the
mask
of
religion
is
nothing
but
a
permanent
political
conspiracy
against
all
the
most
sacred
rights
of
man
and
the
most
holy
laws
of
god
in
those
pages
you
will
not
learn
to
hate
the
roman
catholics
no
but
you
will
learn
to
be
more
than
ever
watchful
in
guarding
the
precious
treasures
of
freedom
bestowed
upon
you
by
your
fathers
you
will
learn
never
to
let
them
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
who
with
the
sacred
name
of
liberty
on
their
lips
and
the
mask
of
liberty
on
their
faces
are
sworn
to
destroy
all
liberty
to
all
the
faithful
ministers
of
the
gospel
i
also
dedicate
this
book
venerable
ministers
of
the
gospel
rome
is
the
great
danger
ahead
for
the
church
of
christ
and
you
do
not
understand
it
enough
the
atmosphere
of
light
honesty
truth
and
holiness
in
which
you
are
born
and
which
you
have
breathed
since
your
infancy
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
you
to
realize
the
dark
mysteries
of
idolatry
immorality
degrading
slavery
hatred
of
the
word
of
god
concealed
behind
the
walls
of
that
modern
babylon
you
are
too
honest
to
suspect
them
and
your
precious
time
is
too
much
taken
up
by
the
sacred
duties
of
your
ministry
to
study
the
long
labyrinth
of
argumentations
which
form
the
bulk
of
the
greater
number
of
controversial
books
besides
that
the
majority
of
the
books
of
controversy
against
rome
are
of
such
a
dry
character
that
though
many
begin
to
read
them
very
few
have
the
courage
to
go
to
the
end
the
consequence
is
an
ignorance
of
romanism
which
becomes
more
and
more
deplorable
and
fatal
every
day
it
is
ignorance
which
paves
the
way
to
the
triumph
of
rome
in
a
near
future
if
there
is
not
a
complete
change
in
your
views
on
that
subject
it
is
that
ignorance
which
paralyzes
the
arm
of
the
church
of
christ
and
makes
the
glorious
word
protestant
senseless
almost
a
dead
and
ridiculous
word
for
who
does
really
protest
against
rome
where
are
those
who
sound
the
trumpet
of
alarm
when
rome
is
striking
you
to
the
heart
by
cursing
your
schools
and
wrenching
the
bible
from
the
hands
of
your
children
when
she
is
not
only
battering
your
doors
but
scaling
your
walls
and
storming
your
citadels
how
few
dare
go
to
the
breach
and
repulse
the
audacious
and
sacrilegious
foe
why
so
because
modern
protestants
have
not
only
forgotten
what
rome
was
what
she
is
and
what
she
will
forever
be
the
most
irreconcilable
and
powerful
enemy
of
the
gospel
of
christ
but
they
consider
her
almost
a
branch
of
the
church
whose
is
christ
faithful
ministers
of
the
gospel
i
present
you
this
book
that
you
may
know
that
the
monster
church
of
rome
who
shed
the
blood
of
your
forefathers
is
still
at
work
at
your
very
door
to
enchain
your
people
to
the
feet
of
her
idols
read
it
and
for
the
first
time
you
will
see
the
inside
life
of
popery
with
the
exactness
of
photography
from
the
supreme
art
with
which
the
mind
of
the
young
and
timid
child
is
fettered
enchained
and
paralyzed
to
the
unspeakable
degradation
of
the
priest
under
the
iron
heel
of
the
bishop
everything
will
be
revealed
to
you
as
it
has
never
been
before
the
superstitions
the
ridiculous
and
humiliating
practices
the
secret
and
mental
agonies
of
the
monks
the
nuns
and
the
priests
will
be
shown
to
you
as
they
were
never
shown
before
in
this
book
the
sophisms
and
errors
of
romanism
are
discussed
and
refuted
with
a
clearness
simplicity
and
evidence
which
my
years
of
priesthood
only
could
teach
me
it
is
not
in
boasting
that
i
say
this
there
can
be
no
boasting
in
me
for
having
been
so
many
years
an
abject
slave
of
the
pope
the
book
i
offer
you
is
an
arsenal
filled
with
the
best
weapons
you
ever
had
to
fight
and
with
the
help
of
god
conquer
the
foe
the
learned
and
zealous
champion
of
protestantism
in
great
britain
rev
badenoch
who
has
revised
the
manuscript
wrote
to
a
friend
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
protestant
work
more
thrilling
in
interest
and
more
important
at
the
present
time
it
is
not
only
full
of
incidents
but
also
of
arguments
on
the
side
of
truth
with
all
classes
of
romanists
from
the
bishops
to
the
parish
priests
i
know
of
no
work
which
gives
so
graphically
the
springs
of
roman
catholic
life
and
at
the
same
time
meets
the
plausible
objections
to
protestantism
in
roman
catholic
circles
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
this
work
would
be
published
in
great
the
venerable
learned

so
well
known

mr

has
submitted
every
chapter
of
his
fifty
years
in
the
church
of
rome
to
me
i
have
read
it
with
care
and
with
the
deepest
interest
and
i
commend
it
to
the
public
favor
in
the
highest
terms
it
is
the
only
book
i
know
that
gives
anything
like
a
full
and
authentic
account
of
the
inner
workings
of
popery
on
this
continent
and
so
effectively
unmasks
its
pretence
to
sanctity
besides
the
most
interesting
biographical
incidents
it
contains
incisive
refutations
of
the
most
plausible
assumptions
and
deadly
errors
of
the
romish
church
it
is
well
fitted
to
awaken
protestants
to
the
insidious
designs
of
the
of
their
faith
and
liberties
and
to
arouse
them
to
a
decisive
opposition
it
is
written
in
a
kindly
and
christian
spirit
does
not
indulge
in
denunciations
and
while
speaking
in
truth
it
does
so
in
love
its
style
is
lively
and
its
english
good
with
only
a
delicate
flavor
of
the
author

to
the
bishops
priests
and
people
of

chapter
i
the
bible
and
the
priest
of
rome
my
father
charles
chiniquy
born
in
quebec
had
studied
in
the
theological
seminary
of
that
city
to
prepare
himself
for
the
priesthood
but
a
few
days
before
making
his
vows
having
been
the
witness
of
a
great
iniquity
in
the
high
quarters
of
the
church
he
changed
his
mind
studied
law
and
became
a
notary
married
to
reine
perrault
daughter
of
mitchel
perrault
in
he
settled
at
first
in
kamoraska
where
i
was
born
on
the
july
about
four
or
five
years
later
my
parents
emigrated
to
murray
bay
that
place
was
then
in
its
infancy
and
no
school
had
yet
been
established
my
mother
was
therefore
my
first
teacher
before
leaving
the
seminary
of
quebec
my
father
had
received
from
one
of
the
superiors
as
a
token
of
his
esteem
a
beautiful
french
and
latin
bible
that
bible
was
the
first
book
after
the
a
b
c
in
which
i
was
taught
to
read
my
mother
selected
the
chapters
which
she
considered
the
most
interesting
for
me
and
i
read
them
every
day
with
the
greatest
attention
and
pleasure
i
was
even
so
much
pleased
with
several
chapters
that
i
read
them
over
and
over
again
till
i
knew
them
by
heart
when
eight
or
nine
years
of
age
i
had
learned
by
heart
the
history
of
the
creation
and
the
fall
of
man
the
deluge
the
sacrifice
of
isaac
the
history
of
moses
the
plagues
of
egypt
the
sublime
hymn
of
moses
after
crossing
the
red
sea
the
history
of
samson
the
most
interesting
events
of
the
life
of
david
several
psalms
all
the
speeches
and
parables
of
christ
and
the
whole
history
of
the
sufferings
and
death
of
our
saviour
as
narrated
by
john
i
had
two
brothers
louis
and
achille
the
first
about
four
the
second
about
eight
years
younger
than
myself
when
they
were
sleeping
or
playing
together
how
many
delicious
hours
i
have
spent
by
my
mother
s
side
in
reading
to
her
the
sublime
pages
of
the
divine
book
sometimes
she
interrupted
me
to
see
if
i
understood
what
i
read
and
when
my
answers
had
made
her
sure
that
i
understood
it
she
used
to
kiss
me
and
press
me
on
her
bosom
as
an
expression
of
her
joy
one
day
while
i
was
reading
the
history
of
the
sufferings
of
the
saviour
my
young
heart
was
so
much
impressed
that
i
could
hardly
enunciate
the
words
and
my
voice
trembled
my
mother
perceiving
my
emotion
tried
to
say
something
on
the
love
of
jesus
for
us
but
she
could
not
utter
a
voice
was
suffocated
by
her
sobs
she
leaned
her
head
on
my
forehead
and
i
felt
two
streams
of
tears
falling
from
her
eyes
on
my
cheeks
i
could
not
contain
myself
any
longer
i
wept
also
and
my
tears
were
mixed
with
hers
the
holy
book
fell
from
my
hands
and
i
threw
myself
into
my
dear
mother
s
arms
no
human
words
can
express
what
was
felt
in
her
soul
and
in
mine
in
that
most
blessed
hour
no
i
will
never
forget
that
solemn
hour
when
my
mother
s
heart
was
perfectly
blended
with
mine
at
the
feet
of
our
dying
saviour
there
was
a
real
perfume
from
heaven
in
those
my
mother
s
tears
which
were
flowing
on
me
it
seemed
then
as
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
was
a
celestial
harmony
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
in
her
sobs
though
more
than
half
a
century
has
passed
since
that
solemn
hour
when
jesus
for
the
first
time
revealed
to
me
something
of
his
suffering
and
of
his
love
my
heart
leaps
with
joy
every
time
i
think
of
it
we
were
some
distance
from
the
church
and
the
roads
in
the
rainy
days
were
very
bad
on
the
sabbath
days
the
neighboring
farmers
unable
to
go
to
church
were
accustomed
to
gather
at
our
house
in
the
evening
then
my
parents
used
to
put
me
up
on
a
large
table
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
and
i
delivered
to
those
good
people
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
the
breathless
attention
the
applause
of
our
guests
i
tell
the
tears
of
joy
which
my
mother
tried
in
vain
to
conceal
supported
my
strength
and
gave
me
the
courage
i
wanted
to
speak
when
so
young
before
so
many
people
when
my
parents
saw
that
i
was
growing
tired
my
mother
who
had
a
fine
voice
sang
some
of
the
beautiful
french
hymns
with
which
her
memory
was
filled
several
times
when
the
fine
weather
allowed
me
to
go
to
church
with
my
parents
the
farmers
would
take
me
into
their
buggies
at
the
door
of
the
temple
and
request
me
to
give
them
some
chapter
of
the
gospel
with
a
most
perfect
attention
they
listened
to
the
voice
of
the
child
whom
the
good
master
had
chosen
to
give
them
the
bread
which
comes
from
heaven
more
than
once
i
remember
that
when
the
bell
called
us
to
the
church
they
expressed
their
regret
that
they
could
not
hear
more
on
one
of
the
beautiful
spring
days
of
my
father
was
writing
in
his
office
and
my
mother
was
working
with
her
needle
singing
one
of
her
favorite
hymns
and
i
was
at
the
door
playing
and
talking
to
a
fine
robin
which
i
had
so
perfectly
trained
that
he
followed
me
wherever
i
went
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
the
priest
coming
near
the
gate
the
sight
of
him
sent
a
thrill
of
uneasiness
through
my
whole
frame
it
was
his
first
visit
to
our
home
the
priest
was
a
person
below
the
common
stature
and
had
an
unpleasant
shoulders
were
large
and
he
was
very
corpulent
his
hair
was
long
and
uncombed
and
his
double
chin
seemed
to
groan
under
the
weight
of
his
flabby
cheeks
i
hastily
ran
to
the
door
and
whispered
to
my
parents
m
le
cure
arrive
mr
curate
is
coming
the
last
sound
was
hardly
out
of
my
lips
when
the
rev
courtois
was
at
the
door
and
my
father
shaking
hands
with
him
gave
him
a
welcome
that
priest
was
born
in
france
where
he
had
a
narrow
escape
having
been
condemned
to
death
under
the
bloody
administration
of
robespierre
he
had
found
a
refuge
with
many
other
french
priests
in
england
whence
he
came
to
quebec
and
the
bishop
of
that
place
had
given
him
the
charge
of
the
parish
of
murray
bay
his
conversation
was
animated
and
interesting
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
hear
him
but
of
a
sudden
his
countenance
changed
as
if
a
dark
cloud
had
come
over
his
mind
and
he
stopped
talking
my
parents
had
kept
themselves
on
a
respectful
reserve
with
the
priest
they
seemed
to
have
no
other
mind
than
to
listen
to
him
the
silence
which
followed
was
exceedingly
unpleasant
for
all
the
parties
it
looked
like
the
heavy
hour
which
precedes
a
storm
at
length
the
priest
addressing
my
father
said
mr
chiniquy
is
it
true
that
you
and
your
child
read
the
bible
yes
sir
was
the
quick
reply
my
little
boy
and
i
read
the
bible
and
what
is
still
better
he
has
learned
by
heart
a
great
number
of
its
most
interesting
chapters
if
you
will
allow
it
curate
he
will
give
you
some
of
i
did
not
come
for
that
purpose
abruptly
replied
the
priest
but
do
you
not
know
that
you
are
forbidden
by
the
holy
council
of
trent
to
read
the
bible
in
french
it
makes
very
little
difference
to
me
whether
i
read
the
bible
in
french
greek
or
latin
answered
my
father
for
i
understand
these
languages
equally
but
are
you
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
you
can
not
allow
your
child
to
read
the
bible
replied
the
priest
my
wife
directs
her
own
child
in
the
reading
of
the
bible
and
i
can
not
see
that
we
commit
any
sin
by
continuing
to
do
in
future
what
we
have
done
till
now
in
that
mr
chiniquy
rejoined
the
priest
you
have
gone
through
a
whole
course
of
theology
you
know
the
duties
of
a
curate
you
know
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
come
here
get
the
bible
from
you
and
burn
my
grandfather
was
a
fearless
spanish
sailor
our
original
name
was
etchiniquia
and
there
was
too
much
spanish
blood
and
pride
in
my
father
to
hear
such
a
sentence
with
patience
in
his
own
house
quick
as
lightning
he
was
on
his
feet
i
pressed
myself
trembling
near
my
mother
who
trembled
also
at
first
i
feared
lest
some
very
unfortunate
and
violent
scene
should
occur
for
my
father
s
anger
at
that
moment
was
really
terrible
but
there
was
another
thing
which
affected
me
i
feared
lest
the
priest
should
lay
his
hands
on
my
dear
bible
which
was
just
before
him
on
the
table
for
it
was
mine
as
it
had
been
given
to
me
the
last
year
as
a
christmas
gift
fortunately
my
father
had
subdued
himself
after
the
first
moment
of
his
anger
he
was
pacing
the
room
with
a
step
his
lips
were
pale
and
trembling
and
he
was
muttering
between
his
teeth
words
which
were
unintelligible
to
any
one
of
us
the
priest
was
closely
watching
all
my
father
s
movements
his
hands
were
convulsively
pressing
his
heavy
cane
and
his
face
was
giving
the
sure
evidence
of
a
too
terror
it
was
clear
that
the
ambassador
of
rome
did
not
find
himself
infallibly
sure
of
his
position
on
the
ground
he
had
so
foolishly
chosen
to
take
since
his
last
words
he
had
remained
as
silent
as
a
tomb
at
last
after
having
paced
the
room
for
a
considerable
time
my
father
suddenly
stopped
before
the
priest
and
said
sir
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
here
yes
sir
said
the
trembling
priest
well
sir
added
my
father
you
know
the
door
by
which
you
entered
my
house
please
take
the
same
door
and
go
away
the
priest
went
out
immediately
i
felt
an
inexpressible
joy
when
i
saw
that
my
bible
was
safe
i
ran
to
my
father
s
neck
kissed
and
thanked
him
for
his
victory
and
to
pay
him
in
my
childish
way
i
jumped
upon
the
large
table
and
recited
in
my
best
style
the
fight
between
david
and
goliath
of
course
in
my
mind
my
father
was
david
and
the
priest
of
rome
was
the
giant
whom
the
little
stone
from
the
brook
had
stricken
down
thou
knowest
o
god
that
it
is
to
that
bible
read
on
my
mother
s
knees
i
owe
by
thy
infinite
mercy
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
that
bible
had
sent
to
my
young
heart
and
intelligence
rays
of
light
which
all
the
sophisms
and
dark
errors
of
rome
could
never
completely
extinguish
chapter
ii
my
first
at
monk
and
celibacy
in
the
month
of
june
my
parents
sent
me
to
an
excellent
school
at
thomas
one
of
my
mother
s
sisters
resided
there
who
was
the
wife
of
an
industrious
miller
called
stephen
eschenbach
they
had
no
children
and
they
received
me
as
their
own
son
the
beautiful
village
of
thomas
had
already
at
that
time
a
considerable
population
the
two
fine
rivers
which
unite
their
rapid
waters
in
its
very
midst
before
they
fall
into
the
magnificent
basin
from
which
they
flow
into
the
lawrence
supplied
the
for
several
mills
and
factories
there
was
in
the
village
a
considerable
trade
in
grain
flour
and
lumber
the
fisheries
were
very
profitable
and
the
game
was
abundant
life
was
really
pleasant
and
easy
the
families
tachez
cazeault
fournier
dubord
frechette
tetu
dupuis
couillard
duberges
which
were
among
the
most
ancient
and
notable
of
canada
were
at
the
head
of
the
intellectual
and
material
movements
of
the
place
and
they
were
a
real
honor
to
the
french
canadian
name
i
met
there
with
one
of
my
ancestors
on
my
mother
s
side
whose
name
was
amour
des
plaines
he
was
an
old
and
brave
soldier
and
would
sometimes
show
us
the
numerous
wounds
he
had
received
in
the
battles
in
which
he
had
fought
for
his
country
though
nearly
eighty
years
old
he
sang
to
us
the
songs
of
the
good
old
times
with
all
the
vivacity
of
a
young
man
the
school
of
allen
jones
to
which
i
had
been
sent
was
worthy
of
its
reputation
i
have
never
known
and
teacher
who
deserved
more
or
who
enjoyed
in
a
higher
degree
the
respect
and
confidence
of
his
pupils
he
was
born
in
england
and
belonged
to
one
of
the
most
respectable
families
there
he
had
received
the
best
education
which
england
could
give
to
her
sons
after
having
gone
through
a
perfect
course
of
study
at
home
he
had
gone
to
paris
where
he
had
also
completed
an
academical
course
he
was
perfectly
master
of
the
french
and
english
languages
and
it
was
not
without
good
reasons
that
he
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
scholars
from
every
corner
of
canada
the
children
of
the
best
families
of
thomas
were
with
me
attending
the
school
of
jones
but
he
was
a
protestant
the
priest
was
much
opposed
to
him
and
every
effort
was
made
by
that
priest
to
induce
my
relatives
to
take
me
away
from
that
school
and
send
me
to
one
under
his
care
the
name
of
the
priest
was
loranger
he
had
a
swarthy
countenance
and
in
person
was
lean
and
tall
his
preaching
had
no
attraction
and
he
was
far
from
being
popular
among
the
intelligent
part
of
the
people
of
thomas
tachez
whose
high
capacity
afterwards
brought
him
to
the
head
of
the
canadian
government
was
the
leading
man
of
thomas
being
united
by
the
bonds
of
a
sincere
friendship
with
his
nephew
cazeault
who
was
afterward
placed
at
the
head
of
the
university
of
laval
in
quebec
i
had
many
opportunities
of
going
to
the
house
of
tachez
where
my
young
friend
was
boarding
in
those
days
tachez
had
no
need
of
the
influence
of
the
priests
and
he
frequently
gave
vent
to
his
supreme
contempt
for
them
once
a
week
there
was
a
meeting
in
his
house
of
the
principal
citizens
of
thomas
where
the
highest
questions
of
history
and
religion
were
freely
and
warmly
discussed
but
the
premises
as
well
as
the
conclusion
of
these
discussions
were
invariably
adverse
to
the
priests
and
religion
of
rome
and
too
often
to
every
form
of
christianity
though
these
meetings
had
not
entirely
the
character
or
exclusiveness
of
secret
societies
they
were
secret
to
a
great
extent
my
friend
cazeault
was
punctual
in
telling
me
the
days
and
hours
of
the
meeting
and
i
used
to
go
with
him
to
an
adjoining
room
from
which
we
could
hear
everything
without
being
suspected
from
what
i
heard
and
saw
in
these
meetings
i
most
certainly
would
have
been
ruined
had
not
the
word
of
god
with
which
my
mother
had
filled
my
young
mind
and
heart
been
my
shield
and
strength
i
was
often
struck
with
terror
and
filled
with
disgust
at
what
i
heard
at
those
meetings
but
what
a
strange
and
deplorable
thing
my
conscience
was
condemning
me
every
time
i
listened
to
these
impious
discussions
while
there
was
a
strong
craving
in
me
to
hear
them
that
i
could
not
resist
there
was
then
in
thomas
a
personage
who
was
unique
in
his
character
he
never
mixed
with
the
society
of
the
village
but
was
nevertheless
the
object
of
much
respectful
attention
and
inquiry
from
every
one
he
was
one
of
the
former
monks
of
canada
known
under
the
name
of
capucin
or
recollets
whom
the
conquest
of
canada
by
great
britain
had
forced
to
leave
their
monastery
he
was
a
clockmaker
and
lived
honorably
by
his
trade
his
little
white
house
in
the
very
midst
of
the
village
was
the
perfection
of
neatness
brother
mark
as
he
was
called
was
a
remarkably
man
high
stature
large
and
splendid
shoulders
and
the
most
beautiful
hands
i
ever
saw
his
long
black
robe
tied
around
his
waist
by
a
white
sash
was
remarkable
for
its
cleanliness
his
life
was
really
a
solitary
one
always
alone
with
his
own
sister
who
kept
his
house
every
day
that
the
weather
was
propitious
brother
mark
spent
a
couple
of
hours
in
fishing
and
as
i
was
myself
exceedingly
fond
of
that
exercise
i
used
to
meet
him
often
along
the
banks
of
the
beautiful
rivers
of
thomas
his
presence
was
always
a
good
omen
to
me
for
he
was
more
expert
than
i
in
finding
the
best
places
for
fishing
as
soon
as
he
found
a
place
where
the
fish
was
abundant
he
would
make
signs
to
me
or
call
me
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
i
might
share
in
his
good
luck
i
appreciated
his
delicate
attention
to
me
and
repaid
him
with
the
marks
of
a
sincere
gratitude
the
good
monk
had
entirely
conquered
my
young
heart
and
i
cherished
a
sincere
regard
for
him
he
often
invited
me
to
his
solitary
but
neat
little
home
and
i
never
visited
him
without
receiving
some
proofs
of
a
sincere
kindness
his
good
sister
rivalled
him
in
overwhelming
me
with
such
marks
of
attention
and
love
as
i
could
only
expect
from
a
dear
mother
there
was
a
mixture
of
timidity
and
dignity
in
the
manners
of
brother
mark
which
i
have
found
in
no
one
else
he
was
fond
of
children
and
nothing
could
be
more
graceful
than
his
smile
every
time
that
he
could
see
that
i
appreciated
his
kindness
and
that
i
gave
him
any
proof
of
my
gratitude
but
that
smile
and
any
other
expression
of
joy
were
very
transient
on
a
sudden
he
would
change
and
it
was
obvious
that
a
mysterious
cloud
was
passing
over
his
heart
the
pope
had
released
the
monks
of
the
monastery
to
which
he
belonged
from
their
vows
of
poverty
and
obedience
the
consequence
was
that
they
could
become
sic
and
even
rich
by
their
own
industry
it
was
in
their
power
to
rise
to
a
respectable
position
in
the
world
by
their
honorable
efforts
the
pope
had
given
them
the
permission
they
wanted
that
they
might
earn
an
honest
living
but
what
a
strange
and
incredible
folly
to
ask
the
permission
of
a
pope
to
be
allowed
to
live
honorably
on
the
fruits
of
one
s
own
industry
these
poor
monks
having
been
released
from
their
vows
of
obedience
were
no
longer
the
slaves
of
a
man
but
were
now
permitted
to
go
to
heaven
on
the
sole
condition
that
they
would
obey
the
laws
of
god
and
the
laws
of
their
country
but
into
what
a
frightful
abyss
of
degradation
men
must
have
fallen
to
believe
that
they
required
a
license
from
rome
for
such
a
purpose
this
is
nevertheless
the
simple
and
naked
truth
that
excess
of
folly
and
that
supreme
impiety
and
degradation
are
among
the
fundamental
dogmas
of
rome
the
infallible
pope
assures
the
world
that
there
is
no
possible
salvation
for
any
one
who
does
not
sincerely
believe
what
he
teaches
in
this
matter
but
the
pope
who
had
so
graciously
relieved
the
canadian
monks
from
their
vows
of
obedience
and
poverty
had
been
inflexible
in
reference
to
their
vows
of
celibacy
from
this
there
was
no
relief
the
honest
desires
of
the
good
monk
to
live
according
to
the
laws
of
god
with
a
wife
whom
heaven
might
have
given
him
had
become
an
pope
vetoed
it
the
unfortunate
monk
was
bound
to
believe
that
he
would
be
forever
damned
if
he
dared
to
accept
as
a
gospel
truth
the
word
of
god
which
says
propter
fornicationem
antem
unusquisque
uxorem
suam
habeat
unaquaque
virum
suum
habeat
vulgate
bible
of
rome
nevertheless
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
vii
that
shining
light
which
the
word
contains
and
which
gives
life
to
man
was
entirely
shut
out
from
brother
mark
he
was
not
allowed
to
know
that
god
himself
had
said
it
is
not
good
that
man
should
be
alone
i
will
make
him
an
for
him
brother
mark
was
endowed
with
such
a
loving
heart
he
could
not
be
known
without
being
loved
and
he
must
have
suffered
much
in
that
celibacy
which
his
faith
in
the
pope
imposed
upon
him
far
away
from
the
regions
of
light
truth
and
life
that
soul
tied
to
the
feet
of
the
implacable
modern
divinity
which
the
romanists
worship
under
the
name
of
sovereign
pontiff
was
trying
in
vain
to
annihilate
and
destroy
the
instincts
and
affections
which
god
himself
had
implanted
in
him
one
day
as
i
was
amusing
myself
with
a
few
other
young
friends
near
the
house
of
brother
mark
suddenly
we
saw
something
covered
with
blood
thrown
from
the
window
and
falling
at
a
short
distance
from
us
at
the
same
instant
we
heard
loud
cries
evidently
coming
from
the
monk
s
house
o
my
god
have
mercy
on
me
save
me
i
am
lost
the
sister
of
brother
mark
rushed
out
of
doors
and
cried
to
some
men
who
were
passing
by
come
to
our
help
my
poor
brother
is
dying
for
god
s
sake
make
haste
he
is
losing
all
his
blood
i
ran
to
the
door
but
the
lady
shut
it
abruptly
and
turned
me
out
saying
we
do
not
want
children
i
had
a
sincere
affection
for
the
good
brother
he
had
invariably
been
so
kind
to
me
i
insisted
and
respectfully
requested
to
be
allowed
to
enter
though
young
and
weak
it
seemed
that
my
friendly
feelings
towards
the
suffering
brother
would
add
to
my
strength
and
enable
me
to
be
of
some
service
but
my
request
was
sternly
rejected
and
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
street
among
the
crowd
which
was
fast
gathering
the
singular
mystery
in
which
they
were
trying
to
wrap
the
poor
monk
filled
me
with
trouble
and
anxiety
but
that
trouble
was
soon
changed
into
an
unspeakable
confusion
when
i
heard
the
convulsive
laughing
of
the
low
people
and
the
shameful
jokes
of
the
crowd
after
the
doctor
had
told
the
nature
of
the
wound
which
was
causing
the
unfortunate
man
to
bleed
almost
to
death
i
was
struck
with
such
horror
that
i
fled
away
i
did
not
want
to
know
any
more
of
that
tragedy
i
had
already
known
too
much
poor
brother
mark
had
ceased
to
be
a
had
become
an
eunuch
o
cruel
and
godless
church
of
rome
how
many
souls
hast
thou
deceived
and
tortured
how
many
hearts
hast
thou
broken
with
that
celibacy
which
satan
alone
could
invent
this
unfortunate
victim
of
a
most
degrading
religion
did
not
however
die
from
his
rash
action
he
soon
recovered
his
usual
health
having
meanwhile
ceased
to
visit
him
some
months
later
i
was
fishing
along
the
river
in
a
very
solitary
place
the
fish
were
abundant
and
i
was
completely
absorbed
in
catching
them
when
on
a
sudden
i
felt
on
my
shoulder
the
gentle
pressure
of
a
hand
it
was
brother
mark
s
i
thought
i
would
faint
through
the
opposite
sentiments
of
surprise
of
pain
and
joy
which
at
the
same
time
crossed
my
mind
with
an
affectionate
and
trembling
voice
he
said
to
me
my
dear
child
why
do
you
not
come
to
see
me
any
more
i
did
not
dare
to
look
at
him
after
he
had
addressed
me
these
words
i
liked
him
on
account
of
his
acts
of
kindness
to
me
but
the
fatal
hour
when
in
the
street
before
the
door
i
had
suffered
so
much
on
his
fatal
hour
was
on
my
heart
as
a
mountain
which
i
could
not
put
could
not
answer
him
he
then
asked
me
again
with
the
tone
of
a
criminal
who
sues
for
mercy
why
is
it
my
dear
child
that
you
do
not
come
any
longer
to
see
me
you
know
that
i
love
dear
brother
mark
i
answered
i
will
never
forget
your
kindness
to
me
i
will
forever
be
grateful
to
you
i
wish
that
it
would
be
in
my
power
to
continue
as
formerly
to
go
and
see
you
but
i
can
not
and
you
ought
to
know
the
reason
why
i
can
not
i
had
pronounced
these
words
with
eyes
i
was
a
child
with
the
timidity
and
happy
ignorance
of
a
child
but
the
action
of
that
unfortunate
man
had
struck
me
with
such
a
horror
that
i
could
not
entertain
the
idea
of
visiting
him
any
more
he
spent
two
or
three
minutes
without
saying
a
word
and
without
moving
but
i
heard
his
sobs
and
his
cries
and
his
cries
were
those
of
despair
and
anguish
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
heard
since
i
could
not
contain
myself
any
longer
i
was
suffocating
with
suppressed
emotion
and
i
would
have
fallen
insensible
to
the
ground
if
two
streams
of
tears
had
not
burst
from
my
eyes
those
tears
did
me
did
him
good
told
him
that
i
was
still
his
friend
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
pressed
me
to
his
tears
were
mixed
with
mine
but
i
could
not
emotions
of
my
heart
were
too
much
for
my
age
i
sat
on
a
damp
and
cold
stone
in
order
not
to
faint
he
fell
on
his
knees
by
my
side
ah
if
i
were
a
painter
i
would
make
a
most
striking
tableau
of
that
scene
his
eyes
swollen
and
red
with
weeping
were
raised
to
heaven
his
hand
lifted
up
in
the
attitude
of
supplication
he
was
crying
out
with
an
accent
which
seemed
as
though
it
would
break
my
heart
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
que
je
suis
my
god
my
god
what
a
wretched
man
i
am
the
years
that
i
have
been
a
priest
of
rome
have
revealed
to
me
the
fact
that
the
cries
of
desolation
i
heard
that
day
were
but
the
echo
of
the
cries
of
desolation
which
go
out
from
almost
every
nunnery
every
parsonage
and
every
house
where
human
beings
are
bound
by
the
ties
of
the
romish
celibacy
god
knows
that
i
am
a
faithful
witness
of
what
my
eyes
have
seen
and
my
ears
have
heard
when
i
say
to
the
multitudes
which
the
church
of
rome
has
bewitched
with
her
enchantments
wherever
there
are
nuns
monks
and
priests
who
live
in

chapter
iii
the
confession
of
children
no
words
can
express
to
those
who
have
never
had
any
experience
in
the
matter
the
consternation
anxiety
and
shame
of
a
poor
romish
child
when
he
hears
for
the
first
time
his
priest
saying
from
the
pulpit
in
a
grave
and
solemn
tone
this
week
you
will
send
your
children
to
confession
make
them
understand
that
this
action
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
their
lives
that
for
every
one
of
them
it
will
decide
their
eternal
happiness
or
misery
fathers
and
mothers
if
through
your
fault
or
his
own
your
child
is
guilty
of
a
bad
he
conceals
his
sins
and
commences
lying
to
the
priest
who
holds
the
place
of
god
himself
this
sin
is
often
irreparable
the
devil
will
take
possession
of
his
heart
he
will
become
accustomed
to
lie
to
his
father
confessor
or
rather
to
jesus
christ
of
whom
he
is
a
representative
his
life
will
be
a
series
of
sacrileges
his
death
and
eternity
those
of
the
reprobate
teach
him
therefore
to
examine
thoroughly
his
actions
words
and
thoughts
in
order
to
confess
without
i
was
in
the
church
of
thomas
when
those
words
fell
upon
me
like
a
thunderbolt
i
had
often
heard
my
mother
say
when
at
home
and
my
aunt
since
i
had
come
to
thomas
that
upon
the
first
confession
depended
my
eternal
happiness
or
misery
that
week
was
therefore
to
decide
about
my
eternity
pale
and
dismayed
i
left
the
church
and
returned
to
the
house
of
my
relatives
i
took
my
place
at
the
table
but
could
not
eat
so
much
was
i
troubled
i
went
to
my
room
for
the
purpose
of
commencing
my
examination
of
conscience
and
to
try
to
recall
my
sinful
actions
words
and
thoughts
although
scarcely
over
ten
years
of
age
this
task
was
really
overwhelming
for
me
i
knelt
down
to
pray
to
the
virgin
mary
for
help
but
i
was
so
much
taken
up
with
the
fear
of
forgetting
something
and
of
making
a
bad
confession
that
i
muttered
my
prayers
without
the
least
attention
to
what
i
said
it
became
still
worse
when
i
commenced
counting
my
sins
my
memory
became
confused
my
head
grew
dizzy
my
heart
beat
with
a
rapidity
which
exhausted
me
and
my
brow
was
covered
with
perspiration
after
a
considerable
length
of
time
spent
in
these
painful
efforts
i
felt
bordering
on
despair
from
the
fear
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
remember
everything
the
night
following
was
almost
a
sleepless
one
and
when
sleep
did
come
it
could
scarcely
be
called
a
sleep
but
a
suffocating
delirium
in
a
frightful
dream
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
cast
into
hell
for
not
having
confessed
all
my
sins
to
the
priest
in
the
morning
i
awoke
fatigued
and
prostrated
by
the
phantoms
of
that
terrible
night
in
similar
troubles
of
mind
were
passed
three
days
which
preceded
my
first
confession
i
had
constantly
before
me
the
countenance
of
that
stern
priest
who
had
never
smiled
upon
me
he
was
present
in
my
thoughts
during
the
day
and
in
my
dreams
during
the
night
as
the
minister
of
an
angry
god
justly
irritated
against
me
on
account
of
my
sins
forgiveness
had
indeed
been
promised
to
me
on
condition
of
a
good
confession
but
my
place
had
also
been
shown
to
me
in
hell
if
my
confession
was
not
as
near
perfection
as
possible
now
my
troubled
conscience
told
me
that
there
were
chances
against
one
that
my
confession
would
be
bad
whether
by
my
own
fault
i
forgot
some
sins
or
i
was
without
that
contrition
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
but
the
nature
and
effects
of
which
were
a
perfect
chaos
to
my
mind
thus
it
was
that
the
cruel
and
perfidious
church
of
rome
took
away
from
my
young
heart
the
good
and
merciful
jesus
whose
love
and
compassion
had
caused
me
to
shed
tears
of
joy
when
i
was
beside
my
mother
the
saviour
whom
that
church
made
me
to
worship
through
fear
was
not
the
saviour
who
called
little
children
unto
him
to
bless
them
and
take
them
in
his
arms
her
impious
hands
were
soon
to
torture
and
defile
my
childish
heart
and
place
me
at
the
feet
of
a
pale
and
severe
looking
representative
of
a
pitiless
god
i
was
made
to
tremble
with
terror
at
the
footstool
of
an
implacable
divinity
while
the
gospel
asked
of
me
only
tears
of
love
and
joy
shed
at
the
feet
of
the
incomparable
friend
of
sinners
at
length
came
the
day
of
confession
or
rather
of
judgment
and
condemnation
i
presented
myself
to
the
priest
loranger
was
no
longer
priest
of
thomas
he
had
been
succeeded
by
beaubien
who
did
not
favor
our
school
any
more
than
his
predecessor
he
had
even
taken
upon
himself
to
preach
a
sermon
against
the
heretical
school
by
which
we
had
been
excessively
wounded
his
want
of
love
for
us
however
i
must
say
was
fully
reciprocated
beaubien
had
then
the
defect
of
lisping
and
stammering
this
we
often
turned
into
ridicule
and
one
of
my
favorite
amusements
was
to
imitate
him
which
brought
bursts
of
laughter
from
us
all
it
had
been
necessary
for
me
to
examine
myself
upon
the
number
of
times
i
had
mocked
him
this
circumstance
was
not
calculated
to
make
my
confession
easier
or
more
agreeable
at
last
the
dreaded
moment
came
i
knelt
at
the
side
of
my
confessor
my
whole
frame
trembled
i
repeated
the
prayer
preparatory
to
confession
scarcely
knowing
what
i
said
so
much
was
i
troubled
with
fear
by
the
instructions
which
had
been
given
us
before
confession
we
had
been
made
to
believe
that
the
priest
was
the
true
almost
the
personification
of
jesus
christ
the
consequence
was
that
i
believed
my
greatest
sin
had
been
that
of
mocking
the
priest
having
always
been
told
that
it
was
best
to
confess
the
greatest
sin
first
i
commenced
thus
father
i
accuse
myself
of
having
mocked
a
scarcely
had
i
uttered
these
words
mocked
a
priest
when
this
pretended
representative
of
the
humble
saviour
turning
towards
me
and
looking
in
my
face
in
order
to
know
me
better
asked
abruptly
what
priest
did
you
mock
my
boy
i
would
rather
have
chosen
to
cut
out
my
tongue
than
to
tell
him
to
his
face
who
it
was
i
therefore
kept
silent
for
a
while
but
my
silence
made
him
very
nervous
and
almost
angry
with
a
haughty
tone
of
voice
he
said
what
priest
did
you
take
the
liberty
of
thus
mocking
i
saw
that
i
had
to
answer
happily
his
haughtiness
had
made
me
firmer
and
bolder
i
said
sir
you
are
the
priest
whom
i
but
how
many
times
did
you
take
upon
you
to
mock
me
my
boy
i
tried
to
find
out
i
answered
but
never
you
must
tell
me
how
many
times
for
to
mock
one
s
own
priest
is
a
great
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
you
the
number
of
times
answered
i
well
my
child
i
will
help
your
memory
by
asking
you
questions
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
think
you
have
mocked
me
ten
times
a
great
many
times
more
fifty
times
many
more
a
hundred
times
say
five
hundred
times
and
perhaps
more
answered
i
why
my
boy
do
you
spend
all
your
time
in
mocking
me
not
all
but
unfortunately
i
do
it
very
well
may
you
say
for
so
to
mock
your
priest
who
holds
the
place
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
is
a
great
misfortune
and
a
great
sin
for
you
but
tell
me
my
little
boy
what
reason
have
you
for
mocking
me
thus
in
my
examinations
of
conscience
i
had
not
foreseen
that
i
should
be
obliged
to
give
the
reasons
for
mocking
the
priest
and
i
was
really
thunderstruck
by
his
questions
i
dared
not
answer
and
i
remained
for
a
long
time
dumb
from
the
shame
that
overpowered
me
but
with
a
harrassing
perseverance
the
priest
insisted
on
my
telling
why
i
had
mocked
him
telling
me
that
i
should
be
damned
if
i
did
not
tell
the
whole
truth
so
i
decided
to
speak
and
said
i
mocked
you
for
several
what
made
you
first
mock
me
continued
the
priest
i
laughed
at
you
because
you
lisped
among
the
pupils
of
our
school
it
often
happens
that
we
imitate
your
preaching
to
excite
have
you
often
done
that
almost
every
day
especially
in
our
holidays
and
since
you
preached
against
for
what
other
reasons
did
you
laugh
at
me
my
little
boy
for
a
long
time
i
was
silent
every
time
i
opened
my
mouth
to
speak
courage
failed
me
however
the
priest
continuing
to
urge
me
i
said
at
last
it
is
rumored
in
town
that
you
love
girls
that
you
visit
the
misses
richards
every
evening
and
this
often
makes
us
the
poor
priest
was
evidently
overwhelmed
by
my
answer
and
ceased
questioning
me
on
this
subject
changing
the
conversation
he
said
what
are
your
other
sins
i
began
to
confess
them
in
the
order
in
which
they
came
to
my
memory
but
the
feeling
of
shame
which
overpowered
me
in
repeating
all
my
sins
to
this
man
was
a
thousand
times
greater
than
that
of
having
offended
god
in
reality
this
feeling
of
human
shame
which
absorbed
my
my
whole
no
room
for
any
religious
feeling
at
all
when
i
had
confessed
all
the
sins
i
could
remember
the
priest
began
to
ask
me
the
strangest
questions
on
matters
about
which
my
pen
must
be
silent
i
replied
father
i
do
not
understand
what
you
ask
i
question
you
on
the
sixth
commandment
seventh
in
the
bible
confess
all
you
will
go
to
hell
if
through
your
fault
you
omit
thereupon
he
dragged
my
thoughts
to
regions
which
thank
god
had
hitherto
been
unknown
to
me
i
answered
him
i
do
not
understand
you
or
i
have
never
done
these
then
skilfully
shifting
to
some
secondary
matter
he
would
soon
slyly
and
cunningly
come
back
to
his
favorite
subject
namely
sins
of
licentiousness
his
questions
were
so
unclean
that
i
blushed
and
felt
sick
with
disgust
and
shame
more
than
once
i
had
been
to
my
regret
in
the
company
of
bad
boys
but
not
one
of
them
has
offended
my
moral
nature
so
much
as
this
priest
had
done
not
one
of
them
had
ever
approached
the
shadow
of
the
things
from
which
that
man
tore
the
veil
and
which
he
placed
before
the
eye
of
my
soul
in
vain
did
i
tell
him
that
i
was
not
guilty
of
such
things
that
i
did
not
even
understand
what
he
asked
me
he
would
not
let
me
off
like
the
vulture
bent
upon
tearing
the
poor
bird
that
falls
into
his
claws
that
cruel
priest
seemed
determined
to
defile
and
ruin
my
heart
at
last
he
asked
me
a
question
in
a
form
of
expression
so
bad
that
i
was
really
pained
i
felt
as
if
i
had
received
a
shock
from
an
electric
battery
a
feeling
of
horror
made
me
shudder
i
was
so
filled
with
indignation
that
speaking
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
many
i
told
him
sir
i
am
very
wicked
i
have
seen
heard
and
done
many
things
which
i
regret
but
i
never
was
guilty
of
what
you
mention
to
me
my
ears
have
never
heard
anything
so
wicked
as
what
they
have
heard
from
your
lips
please
do
not
ask
me
any
more
of
those
questions
do
not
teach
me
any
more
evil
than
i
already
the
remainder
of
my
confession
was
short
the
firmness
of
my
voice
had
evidently
frightened
the
priest
and
made
him
blush
he
stopped
short
and
began
to
give
me
some
good
advice
which
might
have
been
useful
to
me
if
the
deep
wounds
which
his
questions
had
inflicted
upon
my
soul
had
not
so
absorbed
my
thoughts
as
to
prevent
me
from
giving
attention
to
what
he
said
he
gave
me
a
short
penance
and
dismissed
me
i
left
the
confessional
irritated
and
confused
from
the
shame
of
what
i
had
just
heard
from
the
mouth
of
that
priest
i
dared
not
lift
my
eyes
from
the
ground
i
went
into
a
retired
corner
of
the
church
to
do
my
penance
that
is
to
recite
the
prayers
he
had
indicated
to
me
i
remained
for
a
long
time
in
church
i
had
need
of
a
calm
after
the
terrible
trial
through
which
i
had
just
passed
but
vainly
i
sought
for
rest
the
shameful
questions
which
had
been
asked
me
the
new
world
of
iniquity
into
which
i
had
been
introduced
the
impure
phantoms
by
which
my
childish
heart
had
been
defiled
confused
and
troubled
my
mind
so
strangely
that
i
began
to
weep
bitterly
why
those
tears
why
that
desolation
i
wept
over
my
sins
alas
i
confess
it
with
shame
my
sins
did
not
call
forth
those
tears
and
yet
how
many
sins
had
i
already
committed
for
which
jesus
shed
his
precious
blood
but
i
confess
my
sins
were
not
the
cause
of
my
desolation
i
was
rather
thinking
of
my
mother
who
had
taken
such
good
care
of
me
and
who
had
so
well
succeeded
in
keeping
away
from
my
thoughts
those
impure
forms
of
sin
the
thoughts
of
which
had
just
now
defiled
my
heart
i
said
to
myself
ah
if
my
mother
had
heard
those
questions
if
she
could
see
the
evil
thoughts
which
overwhelm
me
at
this
she
knew
to
what
school
she
sent
me
when
she
advised
me
in
her
last
letter
to
go
to
confession
how
her
tears
would
mingle
with
mine
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
mother
would
love
me
no
she
would
see
written
upon
my
brow
the
pollution
with
which
that
priest
had
profaned
my
soul
perhaps
the
feeling
of
pride
was
what
made
me
weep
or
perhaps
i
wept
because
of
a
remnant
of
that
feeling
of
original
dignity
whose
traces
had
still
been
left
in
me
i
felt
so
downcast
by
the
disappointment
of
being
removed
farther
from
the
saviour
by
that
confessional
which
had
promised
to
bring
me
nearer
to
him
god
only
knows
what
was
the
depth
of
my
sorrow
at
feeling
myself
more
defiled
and
more
guilty
after
than
before
my
confession
i
left
the
church
only
when
forced
to
do
so
by
the
shades
of
night
and
came
to
my
uncle
s
house
with
that
feeling
of
uneasiness
caused
by
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
bad
action
and
by
the
fear
of
being
discovered
though
this
uncle
as
well
as
most
of
the
principal
citizens
of
the
village
of
thomas
had
the
name
of
being
a
roman
catholic
yet
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
doctrines
of
the
roman
church
he
laughed
at
the
priests
their
masses
their
purgatory
and
especially
their
confession
he
did
not
conceal
that
when
young
he
had
been
scandalized
by
the
words
and
actions
of
a
priest
in
the
confessional
he
spoke
to
me
jestingly
this
increased
my
trouble
and
my
grief
now
said
he
you
will
be
a
good
boy
but
if
you
have
heard
as
many
new
things
as
i
did
the
first
time
i
went
to
confess
you
are
a
very
learned
boy
and
he
burst
into
laughter
i
blushed
and
remained
silent
my
aunt
who
was
a
devoted
roman
catholic
said
to
me
your
heart
is
relieved
is
it
not
since
you
confessed
all
your
sins
i
gave
her
an
evasive
answer
but
i
could
not
conceal
the
sadness
that
overcame
me
i
thought
i
was
the
only
one
from
whom
the
priest
had
asked
those
polluting
questions
but
great
was
my
surprise
on
the
following
day
when
going
to
school
i
learned
that
my
fellow
pupils
had
not
been
happier
than
i
had
been
the
only
difference
was
that
instead
of
being
grieved
they
laughed
at
it
did
the
priest
ask
you
such
and
such
questions
they
would
demand
laughing
boisterously
i
refused
to
reply
and
said
are
you
not
ashamed
to
speak
of
these
things
ah
ah
how
very
scrupulous
you
are
continued
they
if
it
is
not
a
sin
for
the
priest
to
speak
to
us
on
these
matters
how
can
it
be
a
sin
for
us
i
stopped
confounded
not
knowing
what
to
say
i
soon
perceived
that
even
the
young
school
girls
had
not
been
less
polluted
and
scandalized
by
the
questions
of
the
priest
than
the
boys
although
keeping
at
a
distance
such
as
to
prevent
us
from
hearing
all
they
said
i
could
understand
enough
to
convince
me
that
they
had
been
asked
about
the
same
questions
some
of
them
appeared
indignant
while
others
laughed
heartily
i
should
be
misunderstood
were
it
supposed
that
i
mean
to
convey
the
idea
that
this
priest
was
more
to
blame
than
others
or
that
he
did
more
than
fulfil
the
duties
of
his
ministry
in
asking
these
questions
such
however
was
my
opinion
at
the
time
and
i
detested
that
man
with
all
my
heart
until
i
knew
better
i
had
been
unjust
towards
him
for
this
priest
had
only
done
his
duty
he
was
only
obeying
the
pope
and
his
theologians
his
being
a
priest
of
rome
was
therefore
less
his
crime
than
his
misfortune
he
was
as
i
have
been
myself
bound
hand
and
foot
at
the
feet
of
the
greatest
enemy
that
the
holiness
and
truth
of
god
have
ever
had
on
pope
the
misfortune
of
beaubien
like
that
of
all
the
priests
of
rome
was
that
of
having
bound
himself
by
terrible
oaths
not
to
think
for
himself
or
to
use
the
light
of
his
own
reason
many
roman
catholics
even
many
protestants
refuse
to
believe
this
it
is
notwithstanding
a
sad
truth
the
priest
of
rome
is
an
machine
which
acts
thinks
and
speaks
in
matters
of
morals
and
of
faith
only
according
to
the
order
and
the
will
of
the
pope
and
his
theologians
had
beaubien
been
left
to
himself
he
was
naturally
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
ask
such
questions
but
no
doubt
he
had
read
liguori
dens
debreyne
authors
approved
by
the
pope
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
darkness
for
light
and
vice
for
virtue
chapter
iv
the
shepherd
whipped
by
his
sheep
shortly
after
the
trial
of
auricular
confession
my
young
friend
louis
cazeault
accosted
me
on
a
beautiful
morning
and
said
do
you
know
what
happened
last
night
no
i
answered
what
was
the
wonder
you
know
that
our
priest
spends
almost
all
his
evenings
at
richards
house
everybody
thinks
that
he
goes
there
for
the
sake
of
the
two
daughters
well
in
order
to
cure
him
of
that
disease
my
uncle
tache
and
six
others
masked
whipped
him
without
mercy
as
he
was
coming
back
at
eleven
o
clock
at
night
it
is
already
known
by
every
one
in
the
village
and
they
split
their
sides
with
my
first
feeling
on
hearing
that
news
was
one
of
joy
ever
since
my
first
confession
i
felt
angry
every
time
i
thought
of
that
priest
his
questions
had
so
wounded
me
that
i
could
not
forgive
him
i
had
enough
of
however
to
conceal
my
pleasure
and
i
answered
my
friend
you
are
telling
me
a
wicked
story
i
can
t
believe
a
word
of
well
said
young
cazeault
come
at
eight
o
clock
this
evening
to
my
uncle
s
a
secret
meeting
is
to
take
place
then
no
doubt
they
will
speak
of
the
pill
given
to
the
priest
last
night
we
shall
place
ourselves
in
our
little
room
as
usual
and
shall
hear
everything
our
presence
not
being
suspected
you
may
be
sure
that
it
will
be
i
will
go
i
answered
but
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
that
i
went
to
school
at
the
usual
hour
most
of
the
pupils
had
preceded
me
divided
into
groups
of
eight
or
ten
they
were
engaged
in
a
most
lively
conversation
bursts
of
convulsive
laughter
were
heard
from
every
corner
i
could
very
well
see
that
something
uncommon
had
taken
place
in
the
village
i
approached
several
of
these
groups
and
all
received
me
with
the
question
do
you
know
that
the
priest
was
whipped
last
night
as
he
was
coming
from
the
misses
richards
that
is
a
story
invented
for
fun
said
i
you
were
not
there
to
see
him
were
you
you
therefore
know
nothing
about
it
for
if
anybody
had
whipped
the
priest
he
would
not
surely
boast
of
but
we
heard
his
screams
answered
many
voices
what
was
he
then
screaming
out
i
asked
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
help
help
murder
but
you
were
surely
mistaken
about
the
voice
said
i
it
was
not
the
priest
who
shouted
it
was
somebody
else
i
could
never
believe
that
anybody
would
whip
a
priest
in
such
a
crowded
but
said
several
we
ran
to
his
help
and
we
recognized
the
priest
s
voice
he
is
the
only
one
who
lisps
in
the
and
we
saw
him
with
our
own
eyes
said
several
the
school
bell
put
an
end
to
this
conversation
as
soon
as
school
was
out
i
returned
to
the
house
of
my
relatives
not
wishing
to
learn
any
more
about
this
matter
although
i
did
not
like
this
priest
yet
i
was
much
mortified
by
some
remarks
which
the
older
pupils
made
about
him
but
it
was
difficult
not
to
hear
any
more
on
my
arrival
home
i
found
my
uncle
and
aunt
engaged
in
a
very
warm
debate
on
the
subject
my
uncle
wished
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
among
those
who
had
whipped
him
but
he
gave
the
details
so
precisely
he
was
so
merry
over
the
adventure
that
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
a
hand
in
the
plot
my
aunt
was
indignant
and
used
the
most
energetic
expressions
to
show
her
disapprobation
that
bitter
debate
annoyed
me
so
that
i
did
not
stay
long
to
hear
it
all
i
withdrew
to
my
study
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
changed
my
resolution
many
times
about
my
going
to
the
secret
meeting
in
the
evening
at
one
moment
i
would
decide
firmly
not
to
go
my
conscience
told
me
that
as
usual
things
would
be
uttered
which
it
was
not
good
for
me
to
hear
i
had
refused
to
go
to
the
two
last
meetings
and
a
silent
voice
as
it
were
told
me
i
had
done
well
then
a
moment
after
i
was
tormented
by
the
desire
to
know
precisely
what
had
taken
place
the
evening
before
the
flagellation
of
a
priest
in
the
midst
of
a
large
village
was
a
fact
too
worthy
of
note
to
fail
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
a
child
besides
my
aversion
to
the
priest
though
i
concealed
it
as
well
as
i
could
made
me
wish
to
know
whether
everything
was
true
on
the
subject
of
the
chastisement
but
in
the
struggle
between
good
and
evil
which
took
place
in
my
mind
during
that
day
the
evil
was
finally
to
triumph
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
meeting
my
friend
came
to
me
and
said
make
haste
the
members
of
the
association
are
at
this
call
all
my
good
resolutions
vanished
i
hushed
the
voice
of
my
conscience
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
placed
in
an
angle
of
that
little
room
where
for
more
than
two
hours
i
learned
many
strange
and
scandalous
things
about
the
lives
of
the
priests
of
canada
tache
presided
he
opened
the
meeting
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
at
the
beginning
of
his
discourse
i
had
some
difficulty
to
understand
what
he
said
he
spoke
as
one
who
feared
to
be
overheard
when
disclosing
a
secret
to
a
friend
but
after
a
few
preliminary
sentences
he
forgot
the
rule
of
prudence
which
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
and
spoke
with
energy
and
power
etienne
tache
was
naturally
eloquent
he
seemed
to
speak
on
no
question
except
under
the
influence
of
the
deepest
conviction
of
its
truth
his
speech
was
passionate
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
clear
and
agreeable
his
short
and
cutting
sentences
did
not
reach
the
ear
only
they
penetrated
even
the
secret
folds
of
the
soul
he
spoke
in
substance
as
follows
gentlemen
am
happy
to
see
you
here
more
numerously
than
ever
the
grave
events
of
last
night
have
no
doubt
decided
many
of
you
to
attend
debates
which
some
began
to
forsake
but
the
importance
of
which
it
seems
to
me
increases
day
by
day
the
question
debated
in
our
last
the
priests
one
of
life
and
death
not
only
for
our
young
and
beautiful
canada
but
in
a
moral
point
of
view
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
for
our
families
and
for
every
one
of
us
in
particular
there
is
i
know
only
one
opinion
among
us
on
the
subject
of
priests
and
i
am
glad
that
this
opinion
is
not
only
that
of
all
educated
men
in
canada
but
also
of
learned
france
nay
of
the
whole
world
the
reign
of
the
priest
is
the
reign
of
ignorance
of
corruption
and
of
the
most
barefaced
immorality
under
the
mask
of
the
most
refined
hypocrisy
the
reign
of
the
priest
is
the
death
of
our
schools
it
is
the
degradation
of
our
wives
the
prostitution
of
our
daughters
it
is
the
reign
of
loss
of
liberty
we
have
only
one
good
school
i
will
not
say
in
thomas
but
in
all
our
county
this
school
in
our
midst
is
a
great
honor
to
our
village
now
see
the
energy
with
which
all
the
priests
who
come
here
work
for
the
closing
of
that
school
they
use
every
means
to
destroy
that
focus
of
light
which
we
have
started
with
so
much
difficulty
and
which
we
support
by
so
many
sacrifices
with
the
priest
of
rome
our
children
do
not
belong
to
us
he
is
their
master
let
me
explain
the
priest
honors
us
with
the
belief
that
the
bodies
the
flesh
and
bones
of
our
children
are
ours
and
that
our
duty
in
consequence
is
to
clothe
and
feed
them
but
the
nobler
and
more
sacred
part
namely
the
intellect
the
heart
the
soul
the
priest
claims
as
his
own
patrimony
his
own
property
the
priest
has
the
audacity
to
tell
us
that
to
him
alone
it
belongs
to
enlighten
those
intelligences
to
form
those
hearts
to
fashion
those
souls
as
it
may
best
suit
him
he
has
the
impudence
to
tell
us
that
we
are
too
silly
or
perverse
to
know
our
duties
in
this
respect
we
have
not
the
right
of
choosing
our
school
teachers
we
have
not
the
right
to
send
a
single
ray
of
light
into
those
intellects
or
to
give
to
those
souls
who
hunger
and
thirst
after
truth
a
single
crumb
of
that
food
prepared
with
so
much
wisdom
and
success
by
enlightened
men
of
all
ages
by
the
confessional
the
priests
poison
the
springs
of
life
in
our
children
they
initiate
them
into
such
mysteries
of
iniquity
as
would
terrify
old
galley
slaves
by
their
questions
they
reveal
to
them
secrets
of
a
corruption
such
as
carries
its
germs
of
death
into
the
very
marrow
of
their
bones
and
that
from
the
earliest
years
of
their
infancy
before
i
was
fifteen
years
old
i
had
learned
more
real
blackguard
ism
from
the
mouth
of
my
confessor
than
i
have
learned
ever
since
in
my
studies
and
in
my
life
as
a
physician
for
twenty
years
a
few
days
ago
i
questioned
my
little
nephew
louis
cazeault
upon
what
he
had
learned
in
his
confession
he
answered
me
ingenuously
and
repeated
things
to
me
which
i
would
be
ashamed
to
utter
in
your
presence
and
which
you
fathers
of
families
could
not
listen
to
without
blushing
and
just
think
that
not
only
of
little
boys
are
those
questions
asked
but
also
of
our
dear
little
girls
are
we
not
the
most
degraded
of
men
if
we
do
not
set
ourselves
to
work
in
order
to
break
the
iron
yoke
under
which
the
priest
keeps
our
dear
country
and
by
means
of
which
he
keeps
us
with
our
wives
and
children
at
his
feet
like
vile
slaves
while
speaking
to
you
of
the
deleterious
effect
of
the
confessional
upon
our
children
shall
i
forget
its
effect
upon
our
wives
and
upon
ourselves
need
i
tell
you
that
for
most
women
the
confessional
is
a
rendezvous
of
coquetry
and
of
love
do
you
not
feel
as
i
do
myself
that
by
means
of
the
confessional
the
priest
is
more
the
master
of
the
hearts
of
our
wives
than
ourselves
is
not
the
priest
the
private
and
public
confidant
of
our
wives
do
not
our
wives
go
invariably
to
the
feet
of
the
priest
opening
to
him
what
is
most
sacred
and
intimate
in
the
secrets
of
our
lives
as
husbands
and
as
fathers
the
husband
belongs
no
more
to
his
wife
as
her
guide
through
the
dark
and
difficult
paths
of
life
it
is
the
priest
we
are
no
more
their
friends
and
natural
advisers
their
anxieties
and
their
cares
they
do
not
confide
to
us
they
do
not
expect
from
us
the
remedies
for
the
miseries
of
this
life
towards
the
priest
they
turn
their
thoughts
and
desires
he
has
their
entire
and
exclusive
confidence
in
a
word
it
is
the
priest
who
is
the
real
husband
of
our
wives
it
is
he
who
has
the
possession
of
their
respect
and
of
their
hearts
to
a
degree
to
which
no
one
of
us
need
ever
aspire
were
the
priest
an
angel
were
he
not
made
of
flesh
and
bones
just
as
we
are
were
not
his
organization
absolutely
the
same
as
our
own
then
might
we
be
indifferent
to
what
might
take
place
between
him
and
our
wives
whom
he
has
at
his
feet
in
his
more
in
his
heart
but
what
does
my
experience
tell
me
not
only
as
a
physician
but
also
as
a
citizen
of
thomas
what
does
yours
tell
you
our
experience
tells
us
that
the
priest
instead
of
being
stronger
is
weaker
than
we
generally
are
with
respect
to
women
his
sham
vows
of
perfect
chastity
far
from
rendering
him
more
invulnerable
to
the
arrows
of
cupid
expose
him
to
be
made
more
easily
the
victim
of
that
god
so
small
in
form
but
so
dreadful
a
giant
by
the
irresistible
power
of
his
weapons
and
the
extent
of
his
conquests
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
the
last
four
priests
who
came
to
thomas
have
not
three
seduced
many
of
the
wives
and
daughters
of
our
most
respected
families
and
what
security
have
we
that
the
priest
who
is
now
with
us
does
not
walk
in
the
same
path
is
not
the
whole
parish
filled
with
indignation
at
the
long
nightly
visits
made
by
him
to
two
girls
whose
dissolute
morals
are
a
secret
to
nobody
and
when
the
priest
does
not
respect
himself
would
we
not
be
silly
in
continuing
to
give
him
that
respect
of
which
he
himself
knows
he
is
unworthy
at
our
last
meeting
the
opinions
were
divided
at
the
beginning
of
the
discussion
many
thought
it
would
be
well
to
speak
to
the
bishop
about
the
scandal
caused
by
those
nightly
visits
but
the
majority
judged
that
such
steps
would
be
useless
since
the
bishop
would
do
one
of
two
things
namely
he
would
either
pay
no
attention
to
our
just
complaints
as
has
often
been
the
case
or
he
would
remove
this
priest
filling
his
place
with
one
who
would
do
no
better
that
majority
which
became
a
unanimity
acceded
to
my
thought
of
taking
justice
into
our
own
hands
the
priest
is
our
servant
we
pay
him
a
large
tithe
we
have
therefore
claims
upon
him
he
has
abused
us
and
does
so
every
day
by
his
public
neglect
of
the
most
elementary
laws
of
morality
in
visiting
every
night
that
house
whose
degradation
is
known
to
everybody
he
gives
to
youth
an
example
of
perversity
the
effects
of
which
no
one
can
estimate
it
had
been
unanimously
decided
that
he
should
be
whipped
without
my
telling
you
by
whom
it
was
done
you
may
be
assured
that
beaubien
s
flagellation
of
last
night
will
never
be
forgotten
by
him
heaven
grant
that
this
brotherly
correction
be
a
lesson
to
teach
all
the
priests
of
canada
that
their
golden
reign
is
over
that
the
eyes
of
the
people
are
opened
and
that
their
domination
is
drawing
to
an
end
this
discourse
was
listened
to
with
deep
silence
and
tache
saw
by
the
applause
that
followed
that
his
speech
had
been
the
expression
of
everyone
next
followed
a
gentleman
named
dubord
who
in
substance
spoke
as
follows
mr
president
was
not
among
those
who
gave
the
priest
the
expression
of
public
feeling
with
the
energetic
tongue
of
the
whip
i
wish
i
had
been
however
i
would
heartily
have
in
giving
that
lesson
to
the
priests
of
canada
let
me
give
my
reason
my
daughter
who
is
twelve
years
old
went
to
confession
as
did
the
others
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
against
my
will
i
know
by
my
own
experience
that
of
all
actions
confession
is
the
most
degrading
in
a
person
s
life
i
can
imagine
nothing
so
well
calculated
to
destroy
for
ever
one
s
as
the
modern
invention
of
the
confessional
now
what
is
a
person
without
a
woman
without
this
all
is
lost
to
her
forever
in
the
confessional
everything
is
corruption
of
the
lowest
grade
in
the
confessional
a
girl
s
thoughts
are
polluted
her
tongue
is
polluted
her
heart
is
and
forever
polluted
do
i
need
to
tell
you
this
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
though
you
are
now
all
too
intelligent
to
degrade
yourselves
at
the
feet
of
a
priest
though
it
is
long
since
you
have
been
guilty
of
that
meanness
not
one
of
you
have
forgotten
the
lessons
of
corruption
received
when
young
in
the
confessional
those
lessons
were
engraved
on
your
memory
your
thoughts
your
hearts
and
your
souls
like
the
scar
left
by
the
iron
upon
the
brow
of
the
slave
to
remain
a
perpetual
witness
of
his
shame
and
servitude
the
confessional
is
a
place
where
one
gets
accustomed
to
hear
and
repeat
without
a
scruple
things
which
would
cause
even
a
prostitute
to
blush
why
are
roman
catholic
nations
inferior
to
nations
belonging
to
protestantism
only
in
the
confessional
can
the
solution
of
that
problem
be
found
and
why
are
roman
catholic
nations
degraded
in
proportion
to
their
submission
to
the
priest
it
is
because
the
oftener
the
individuals
composing
those
nations
go
to
confession
the
more
rapidly
they
sink
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
and
morality
a
terrible
example
of
this
i
had
in
my
own
house
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
i
was
against
my
daughter
going
to
confession
but
her
poor
mother
who
is
under
the
control
of
the
priest
earnestly
wanted
her
to
go
not
to
have
a
disagreeable
scene
in
my
house
i
had
to
yield
to
the
tears
of
my
wife
on
the
day
following
that
of
her
confession
they
believed
i
was
absent
but
i
was
in
my
office
with
the
door
sufficiently
open
to
allow
me
to
hear
what
was
said
my
wife
and
daughter
had
the
following
conversation
what
makes
you
so
thoughtful
and
sad
my
dear
lucy
since
you
went
to
confession
it
seems
to
me
you
should
feel
happier
since
you
had
the
privilege
of
confessing
your
lucy
made
no
answer
after
a
silence
of
two
or
three
minutes
her
mother
said
why
do
you
weep
dear
child
are
you
ill
still
no
answer
from
the
child
you
may
well
suppose
that
i
was
all
attention
i
had
my
suspicions
about
the
dreadful
ordeal
which
had
taken
place
my
heart
throbbed
with
uneasiness
and
anger
after
a
short
time
my
wife
spoke
to
her
child
with
sufficient
firmness
to
force
her
to
answer
in
a
trembling
voice
and
half
suppressed
with
sobs
my
dear
little
daughter
answered
ah
mamma
if
you
knew
what
the
priest
asked
me
and
what
he
said
to
me
in
the
confessional
you
would
be
as
sad
as
i
but
what
did
he
say
to
you
he
is
a
holy
man
you
surely
did
not
understand
him
if
you
think
he
said
anything
to
pain
dear
mother
as
she
threw
herself
into
her
mother
s
arms
do
not
ask
me
to
confess
what
that
priest
said
he
told
to
me
things
so
shameful
that
i
can
not
repeat
them
but
that
which
pains
me
most
is
the
impossibility
of
banishing
from
my
thoughts
the
hateful
things
which
he
has
taught
me
his
impure
words
are
like
the
leeches
put
upon
the
chest
of
my
friend
could
not
be
removed
without
tearing
the
flesh
what
must
have
been
his
opinion
of
me
to
ask
such
questions
my
child
said
no
more
and
began
to
sob
again
after
a
short
silence
my
wife
rejoined
i
ll
go
to
the
priest
i
ll
tell
him
to
beware
how
he
speaks
in
the
confessional
i
have
noticed
myself
that
he
goes
too
far
with
his
questions
i
however
thought
that
he
was
more
prudent
with
children
after
the
lesson
that
i
ll
give
him
be
sure
that
you
will
have
only
to
tell
your
sins
and
that
you
will
be
no
more
troubled
by
his
endless
questions
i
ask
of
you
however
never
to
speak
of
this
to
anybody
especially
never
let
your
poor
father
know
anything
about
it
for
he
has
little
enough
religion
already
and
this
would
leave
him
without
any
at
i
could
contain
myself
no
longer
i
rose
and
abruptly
entered
the
parlor
my
daughter
threw
herself
weeping
into
my
arms
my
wife
screamed
with
terror
and
almost
fell
into
a
swoon
i
said
to
my
child
if
you
love
me
put
your
hand
on
my
heart
and
promise
me
that
you
ll
never
go
to
confession
again
fear
god
my
child
walk
in
his
presence
for
his
eye
seeth
you
everywhere
remember
that
day
and
night
he
is
ready
to
forgive
us
never
place
yourself
again
at
the
feet
of
a
priest
to
be
defiled
and
degraded
by
him
this
my
daughter
promised
me
when
my
wife
had
recovered
from
her
surprise
i
said
to
her
madam
for
a
long
time
the
priest
has
been
everything
and
your
husband
nothing
to
you
there
is
a
hidden
and
terrible
power
that
governs
your
thoughts
and
affections
as
it
governs
your
is
the
power
of
the
priest
this
you
have
often
denied
but
providence
has
decided
that
this
power
should
be
forever
broken
for
you
and
for
me
i
want
to
be
the
ruler
in
my
own
house
and
from
this
moment
the
power
of
the
priest
over
you
must
cease
unless
you
prefer
to
leave
my
house
forever
the
priest
has
reigned
here
too
long
but
now
that
i
know
he
has
stained
and
defiled
the
soul
of
my
daughter
his
empire
must
fall
whenever
you
go
and
take
your
heart
and
secrets
to
the
feet
of
the
priest
be
so
kind
as
not
to
come
back
to
the
same
house
with
three
other
discourses
followed
that
of
dubord
all
of
which
were
pregnant
with
details
and
facts
going
to
prove
that
the
confessional
was
the
principal
cause
of
the
deplorable
demoralization
of
thomas
if
in
addition
to
all
that
i
could
have
mentioned
before
that
association
what
i
already
knew
of
the
corrupting
influences
of
that
institution
given
to
the
world
by
centuries
of
darkness
certainly
the
determination
of
its
members
to
make
use
of
every
means
to
abolish
its
usage
would
have
been
strengthened
chapter
the
priest
purgatory
and
the
poor
widow
s
cow
the
day
following
that
of
the
meeting
at
which
tache
had
given
his
reasons
for
boasting
that
he
had
whipped
the
priest
i
wrote
to
my
mother
for
god
s
sake
come
for
me
i
can
stay
here
no
longer
if
you
knew
what
my
eyes
have
seen
and
my
ears
have
heard
for
some
time
past
you
would
not
delay
your
coming
a
single
indeed
such
was
the
impression
left
upon
me
by
that
flagellation
and
by
the
speeches
which
i
had
heard
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
crossing
of
the
lawrence
i
would
have
started
for
murray
bay
on
the
day
after
the
secret
meeting
at
which
i
had
heard
things
that
so
terribly
frightened
me
how
i
regretted
the
happy
and
peaceful
days
spent
with
my
mother
in
reading
the
beautiful
chapters
of
the
bible
so
well
chosen
by
her
to
instruct
and
interest
me
what
a
difference
there
was
between
our
conversations
after
these
readings
and
the
conversations
i
heard
at
thomas
happily
my
parents
desire
to
see
me
again
was
as
great
as
mine
to
go
back
to
them
so
that
a
few
weeks
later
my
mother
came
for
me
she
pressed
me
to
her
heart
and
brought
me
back
to
the
arms
of
my
father
i
arrived
at
home
on
the
of
july
and
spent
the
afternoon
and
evening
till
late
by
my
father
s
side
with
what
pleasure
did
he
see
me
working
difficult
problems
in
algebra
and
even
in
geometry
for
under
my
teacher
jones
i
had
really
made
rapid
progress
in
those
branches
more
than
once
i
noticed
tears
of
joy
in
my
father
s
eyes
when
taking
my
slate
he
saw
that
my
calculations
were
correct
he
also
examined
me
in
grammar
what
an
admirable
teacher
this
jones
must
be
he
would
say
to
have
advanced
a
child
so
much
in
the
short
space
of
fourteen
months
how
sweet
to
me
but
how
short
were
those
hours
of
happiness
passed
between
my
good
mother
and
my
father
we
had
family
worship
i
read
the
fifteenth
chapter
of
luke
the
return
of
the
prodigal
son
my
mother
then
sang
a
hymn
of
joy
and
gratitude
and
i
went
to
bed
with
my
heart
full
of
happiness
to
take
the
sweetest
sleep
of
my
life
but
o
god
what
an
awful
awakening
thou
hadst
prepared
for
me
at
about
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
screams
fell
upon
my
ear
i
recognized
my
mother
s
voice
what
is
the
matter
dear
mother
oh
my
dear
child
you
have
no
more
a
father
he
is
dead
in
saying
these
words
she
lost
consciousness
and
fell
on
the
floor
while
a
friend
who
had
passed
the
night
with
us
gave
her
proper
care
i
hastened
to
my
father
s
bed
i
pressed
him
to
my
heart
i
kissed
him
i
covered
him
with
my
tears
i
moved
his
head
i
pressed
his
hands
i
tried
to
lift
him
up
on
his
pillow
i
could
not
believe
that
he
was
dead
it
seemed
to
me
that
even
if
dead
he
would
come
back
to
god
could
not
thus
take
my
father
away
from
me
at
the
very
moment
when
i
had
come
back
to
him
after
so
long
an
absence
i
knelt
to
pray
to
god
for
the
life
of
my
father
but
my
tears
and
cries
were
useless
he
was
dead
he
was
already
cold
as
ice
two
days
after
he
was
buried
my
mother
was
so
overwhelmed
with
grief
that
she
could
not
follow
the
funeral
procession
i
remained
with
her
as
her
only
earthly
support
poor
mother
how
many
tears
thou
hast
shed
what
sobs
came
from
thine
afflicted
heart
in
those
days
of
supreme
grief
though
i
was
then
very
young
i
could
understand
the
greatness
of
our
loss
and
i
mingled
my
tears
with
those
of
my
mother
what
pen
can
portray
what
takes
place
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
when
god
takes
suddenly
her
husband
away
in
the
prime
of
his
life
and
leaves
her
alone
plunged
in
misery
with
three
small
children
two
of
whom
are
even
too
young
to
know
their
loss
how
long
are
the
hours
of
the
day
for
the
poor
widow
who
is
left
alone
and
without
means
among
strangers
how
painful
the
sleepless
night
to
the
heart
which
has
lost
everything
how
empty
a
house
is
left
by
the
eternal
absence
of
him
who
was
its
master
support
and
father
every
object
in
the
house
and
every
step
she
takes
remind
her
of
her
loss
and
sinks
the
sword
deeper
which
pierces
her
heart
oh
how
bitter
are
the
tears
which
flow
from
her
eyes
when
her
youngest
child
who
as
yet
does
not
understand
the
mystery
of
death
throws
himself
into
her
arms
and
says
mamma
where
is
papa
why
does
he
not
come
back
i
am
lonely
my
poor
mother
passed
through
those
trials
i
heard
her
sobs
during
the
long
hours
of
the
day
and
also
during
the
longer
hours
of
the
night
many
times
i
have
seen
her
fall
upon
her
knees
to
implore
god
to
be
merciful
to
her
and
to
her
three
unhappy
orphans
i
could
do
nothing
then
to
comfort
her
but
love
her
pray
and
weep
with
her
only
a
few
days
had
elapsed
after
the
burial
of
my
father
when
i
saw
courtois
the
parish
priest
coming
to
our
house
he
who
had
tried
to
take
away
our
bible
from
us
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
rich
and
as
we
were
poor
and
unhappy
since
my
father
s
death
my
first
thought
was
that
he
had
come
to
comfort
and
to
help
us
i
could
see
that
my
mother
had
the
same
hopes
she
welcomed
him
as
an
angel
from
heaven
the
least
gleam
of
hope
is
so
sweet
to
one
who
is
unhappy
from
his
very
first
words
however
i
could
see
that
our
hopes
were
not
to
be
realized
he
tried
to
be
sympathetic
and
even
said
something
about
the
confidence
that
we
should
have
in
god
especially
in
times
of
trial
but
his
words
were
cold
and
dry
turning
to
me
he
said
do
you
continue
to
read
the
bible
my
little
boy
yes
sir
answered
i
with
a
voice
trembling
with
anxiety
for
i
feared
that
he
would
make
another
effort
to
take
away
that
treasure
and
i
had
no
longer
a
father
to
defend
it
then
addressing
my
mother
he
said
madam
i
told
you
that
it
was
not
right
for
you
or
your
child
to
read
that
my
mother
cast
down
her
eyes
and
answered
only
by
the
tears
which
ran
down
her
cheeks
that
question
was
followed
by
a
long
silence
and
the
priest
then
continued
madam
there
is
something
due
for
the
prayers
which
have
been
sung
and
the
services
which
you
requested
to
be
offered
for
the
repose
of
your
husband
s
soul
i
will
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
pay
me
that
little
mr
courtois
answered
my
mother
my
husband
left
me
nothing
but
debts
i
have
only
the
work
of
my
own
hands
to
procure
a
living
for
my
three
children
the
eldest
of
whom
is
before
you
for
these
little
orphans
sake
if
not
for
mine
do
not
take
from
us
the
little
that
is
but
madam
you
do
not
reflect
your
husband
died
suddenly
and
without
any
preparation
he
is
therefore
in
the
flames
of
purgatory
if
you
want
him
to
be
delivered
you
must
necessarily
unite
your
personal
sacrifices
to
the
prayers
of
the
church
and
the
masses
which
we
as
i
said
my
husband
has
left
me
absolutely
without
means
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
you
any
money
replied
my
mother
but
madam
your
husband
was
for
a
long
time
the
only
notary
of
mal
bay
he
surely
must
have
made
much
money
i
can
scarcely
think
that
he
has
left
you
without
any
means
to
help
him
now
that
his
desolation
and
sufferings
are
far
greater
than
my
husband
did
indeed
coin
much
money
but
he
spent
still
more
thanks
to
god
we
have
not
been
in
want
while
he
lived
but
lately
he
got
this
house
built
and
what
is
still
due
on
it
makes
me
fear
that
i
will
lose
it
he
also
bought
a
piece
of
land
not
long
ago
only
half
of
which
is
paid
and
i
will
therefore
probably
not
be
able
to
keep
it
hence
i
may
soon
with
my
poor
orphans
be
deprived
of
everything
that
is
left
us
in
the
meantime
i
hope
sir
that
you
are
not
a
man
to
take
away
from
us
our
last
piece
of
but
madam
the
masses
offered
for
the
rest
of
your
husband
s
soul
must
be
paid
answered
the
priest
my
mother
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
wept
as
for
me
i
did
not
mingle
my
tears
with
hers
this
time
my
feelings
were
not
those
of
grief
but
of
anger
and
unspeakable
horror
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
face
of
that
man
who
tortured
my
mother
s
heart
i
looked
with
tearless
eyes
upon
the
man
who
added
to
my
poor
mother
s
anguish
and
made
her
weep
more
bitterly
than
ever
my
hands
were
clenched
as
if
ready
to
strike
all
my
muscles
trembled
my
teeth
chattered
as
if
from
intense
cold
my
greatest
sorrow
was
my
weakness
in
the
presence
of
that
big
man
and
my
not
being
able
to
send
him
away
from
our
house
and
driving
him
far
away
from
my
mother
i
felt
inclined
to
say
to
him
are
you
not
ashamed
you
who
are
so
rich
to
come
and
take
away
the
last
piece
of
bread
from
our
mouths
but
my
physical
and
moral
strength
were
not
sufficient
to
accomplish
the
task
before
me
and
i
was
filled
with
regret
and
disappointment
after
a
long
silence
my
mother
raised
her
eyes
reddened
with
tears
on
the
priest
and
said
sir
you
see
that
cow
in
the
meadow
not
far
from
our
house
her
milk
and
the
butter
made
from
it
form
the
principal
part
of
my
children
s
food
i
hope
you
will
not
take
her
away
from
us
if
however
such
a
sacrifice
must
be
made
to
deliver
my
poor
husband
s
soul
from
purgatory
take
her
as
payment
of
the
masses
to
be
offered
to
extinguish
those
devouring
the
priest
instantly
arose
saying
very
well
madam
and
went
out
our
eyes
anxiously
followed
him
but
instead
of
walking
towards
the
little
gate
which
was
in
front
of
the
house
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
meadow
and
drove
the
cow
before
him
in
the
direction
of
his
home
at
that
sight
i
screamed
with
despair
o
my
mother
he
is
taking
our
cow
away
what
will
become
of
us
lord
nairn
had
given
us
that
splendid
cow
when
it
was
three
months
old
her
mother
had
been
brought
from
scotland
and
belonged
to
one
of
the
best
breeds
of
that
country
i
fed
her
with
my
own
hands
and
had
often
shared
my
bread
with
her
i
loved
her
as
a
child
always
loves
an
animal
which
he
has
brought
up
himself
she
seemed
to
understand
and
love
me
also
from
whatever
distance
she
could
see
me
she
would
run
to
me
to
receive
my
caresses
and
whatever
else
i
might
have
to
give
her
my
mother
herself
milked
her
and
her
rich
milk
was
such
delicious
and
substantial
food
for
us
we
all
felt
so
happy
at
breakfast
and
supper
each
with
a
cupful
of
that
pure
and
refreshing
milk
my
mother
also
cried
out
with
grief
as
she
saw
the
priest
taking
away
the
only
means
which
heaven
had
left
her
to
feed
her
children
throwing
myself
into
her
arms
i
asked
her
why
have
you
given
away
our
cow
what
will
become
of
us
we
shall
surely
die
of
dear
child
she
answered
i
did
not
think
the
priest
would
be
so
cruel
as
to
take
away
the
last
resource
which
god
had
left
us
ah
if
i
had
believed
him
to
be
so
unmerciful
i
would
never
have
spoken
to
him
as
i
did
as
you
say
my
dear
child
what
will
become
of
us
but
have
you
not
often
read
to
me
in
your
bible
that
god
is
the
father
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
we
shall
pray
to
that
god
who
is
willing
to
be
your
father
and
mine
he
will
listen
to
us
and
see
our
tears
let
us
kneel
down
and
ask
of
him
to
be
merciful
to
us
and
to
give
us
back
the
support
of
which
the
priest
has
deprived
we
both
knelt
down
she
took
my
right
hand
with
her
left
and
lifting
the
other
hand
towards
heaven
she
offered
a
prayer
to
the
god
of
mercies
for
her
poor
children
such
as
i
have
never
since
heard
her
words
were
often
choked
by
her
sobs
but
when
she
could
not
speak
with
her
voice
she
spoke
with
her
burning
looks
raised
to
heaven
and
with
her
uplifted
hand
i
also
prayed
to
god
with
her
and
repeated
her
words
which
were
broken
by
my
sobs
when
her
prayer
was
ended
she
remained
for
a
long
time
pale
and
trembling
cold
sweat
was
flowing
on
her
face
and
she
fell
on
the
floor
i
thought
she
was
going
to
die
i
ran
for
cold
water
which
i
gave
her
saying
dear
mother
o
do
not
leave
me
alone
upon
earth
after
drinking
a
few
drops
she
felt
better
and
taking
my
hand
she
put
it
to
her
trembling
lips
then
drawing
me
near
her
and
pressing
me
to
her
bosom
she
said
dear
child
if
ever
you
become
a
priest
ask
of
you
never
to
be
so
towards
poor
widows
as
are
the
priests
of
while
she
said
these
words
i
felt
her
burning
tears
falling
upon
my
cheek
the
memory
of
these
tears
has
never
left
me
i
felt
them
constantly
during
the
years
i
spent
in
preaching
the
inconceivable
superstitions
of
rome
i
was
not
better
naturally
than
many
of
the
other
priests
i
believed
as
they
did
the
impious
fables
of
purgatory
and
as
well
as
they
i
confess
it
to
my
shame
if
i
refused
to
take
or
if
i
gave
back
the
money
of
the
poor
i
accepted
the
money
which
the
rich
gave
me
for
the
masses
i
said
to
extinguish
the
flames
of
that
fabulous
place
but
the
remembrance
of
my
mother
s
words
and
tears
has
kept
me
from
being
so
cruel
and
unmerciful
towards
the
poor
widows
as
romish
priests
are
for
the
most
part
obliged
to
be
when
my
heart
depraved
by
the
false
and
impious
doctrines
of
rome
was
tempted
to
take
money
from
widows
and
orphans
pretence
of
my
long
i
then
heard
the
voice
of
my
mother
from
the
depth
of
her
sepulchre
saying
my
dear
child
do
not
be
cruel
towards
poor
widows
and
orphans
as
are
the
priests
of
if
during
the
days
of
my
priesthood
at
quebec
at
beauport
and
kamouraska
i
have
given
almost
all
that
i
had
to
feed
and
clothe
the
poor
especially
the
widows
and
orphans
it
was
not
owing
to
my
being
better
than
others
but
it
was
because
my
mother
had
spoken
to
me
with
words
never
to
be
forgotten
the
lord
i
believe
had
put
into
my
mother
s
mouth
those
words
so
simple
but
so
full
of
eloquence
and
beauty
as
one
of
his
great
mercies
towards
me
those
tears
the
hand
of
rome
has
never
been
able
to
wipe
off
those
words
of
my
mother
the
sophisms
of
popery
could
not
make
me
forget
how
long
o
lord
shall
that
insolent
enemy
of
the
gospel
the
church
of
rome
be
permitted
to
fatten
herself
upon
the
tears
of
the
widow
and
of
the
orphan
by
means
of
that
cruel
and
impious
invention
of
wilt
thou
not
be
merciful
unto
so
many
nations
which
are
still
the
victims
of
that
great
imposture
oh
do
remove
the
veil
which
covers
the
eyes
of
the
priests
and
people
of
rome
as
thou
hast
removed
it
from
mine
make
them
to
understand
that
their
hopes
of
purification
must
not
rest
on
these
fabulous
fires
but
only
on
the
blood
of
the
lamb
shed
on
calvary
to
save
the
world
chapter

festivities
in
a
parsonage

was
sold
unfortunately
though
i
had
carefully
concealed
my
cherished
bible
it
disappeared
i
could
never
discover
what
became
of
it
had
mother
herself
frightened
by
the
threats
of
the
priest
relinquished
that
treasure
or
had
some
of
our
relatives
believing
it
to
be
their
duty
destroyed
it
i
do
not
know
i
deeply
felt
that
loss
which
was
then
irreparable
to
me
on
the
following
day
in
the
midst
of
bitter
tears
and
sobs
i
bade
farewell
to
my
poor
mother
and
young
brothers
they
went
to
thomas
on
board
a
schooner
and
i
crossed
in
a
sloop
to
kamouraska
my
uncle
and
aunt
dionne
welcomed
me
with
every
mark
of
the
most
sincere
affection
having
soon
made
known
to
them
that
i
wished
to
become
a
priest
i
began
to
study
latin
under
the
direction
of
rev
morin
vicar
of
kamouraska
that
priest
was
esteemed
to
be
a
learned
man
he
was
about
forty
or
fifty
years
old
and
had
been
priest
of
a
parish
in
the
district
of
montreal
but
as
is
the
case
with
the
majority
of
priests
his
vows
of
celibacy
had
not
proved
a
sufficient
guarantee
against
the
charms
of
one
of
his
beautiful
parishioners
this
had
caused
a
great
scandal
he
consequently
lost
his
position
and
the
bishop
had
sent
him
to
kamouraska
where
his
past
conduct
was
not
so
generally
known
he
was
very
good
to
me
and
i
soon
loved
him
with
sincere
affection
one
day
about
the
beginning
of
the
year
he
called
me
aside
and
said
mr
varin
the
parish
priest
is
in
the
habit
of
giving
a
great
festival
on
his
birthday
now
the
principal
citizens
of
the
village
wish
on
that
occasion
to
present
him
with
a
bouquet
i
am
appointed
to
write
an
address
and
to
choose
some
one
to
deliver
it
before
the
priest
you
are
the
one
whom
i
have
chosen
what
do
you
think
of
it
but
i
am
very
young
i
replied
your
youth
will
only
give
more
interest
to
what
we
wish
to
say
and
do
said
the
priest
well
i
have
no
objection
to
do
so
provided
the
piece
be
not
too
long
and
that
i
have
it
sufficiently
soon
to
learn
it
it
was
already
prepared
the
time
of
delivering
it
soon
came
the
best
society
of
kamouraska
composed
of
about
fifteen
gentlemen
and
as
many
ladies
were
assembled
in
the
beautiful
parlors
of
the
parsonage
varin
was
in
their
midst
suddenly
squire
paschal
tache
the
seigneur
of
the
parish
and
his
lady
entered
the
room
holding
me
by
each
hand
and
placed
me
in
the
midst
of
the
guests
my
head
was
crowned
with
flowers
for
i
was
to
represent
the
angel
of
the
parish
whom
the
people
had
chosen
to
give
to
their
pastor
the
expression
of
public
admiration
and
gratitude
when
the
address
was
finished
i
presented
to
the
priest
the
beautiful
bouquet
of
symbolical
flowers
prepared
by
the
ladies
for
the
occasion
varin
was
a
small
but
man
his
thin
lips
were
ever
ready
to
smile
graciously
the
remarkable
whiteness
of
his
skin
was
still
heightened
by
the
rose
color
of
his
cheeks
intelligence
and
goodness
beamed
from
his
expressive
black
eyes
nothing
could
be
more
amiable
and
gracious
than
his
conversation
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
in
his
company
he
was
passionately
fond
of
these
little
fetes
and
the
charm
of
his
manners
could
not
be
surpassed
as
the
host
of
the
evening
he
was
moved
to
tears
before
hearing
half
of
the
address
and
the
eyes
of
many
were
moistened
when
the
pastor
with
a
voice
trembling
and
full
of
emotion
expressed
his
joy
and
gratitude
at
being
so
highly
appreciated
by
his
parishioners
as
soon
as
the
happy
pastor
had
expressed
his
thanks
the
ladies
sang
two
or
three
beautiful
songs
the
door
of
the
was
then
opened
and
we
could
see
a
long
table
laden
with
the
most
delicious
meats
and
wines
that
canada
could
afford
i
had
never
before
been
present
at
a
priest
s
dinner
the
honorable
position
given
me
at
that
little
fete
permitted
me
to
see
it
in
all
its
details
and
nothing
could
equal
the
curiosity
with
which
i
sought
to
hear
and
see
all
that
was
said
and
done
by
the
joyous
guests
besides
varin
and
his
vicar
there
were
three
other
priests
who
were
artistically
placed
in
the
midst
of
the
most
beautiful
ladies
of
the
company
the
ladies
after
honoring
us
with
their
presence
for
an
hour
or
so
left
the
table
and
retired
to
the
scarcely
had
the
last
lady
disappeared
when
varin
rose
and
said
gentlemen
let
us
drink
to
the
health
of
these
amiable
ladies
whose
presence
has
thrown
so
many
charms
over
the
first
part
of
our
little
following
the
example
of
varin
each
guest
filled
and
emptied
his
long
in
honor
of
the
ladies
squire
tache
then
proposed
the
health
of
the
most
venerable
and
beloved
priest
of
canada
the
rev
again
the
glasses
were
filled
and
emptied
except
mine
for
i
had
been
placed
at
the
side
of
my
uncle
dionne
who
sternly
looking
at
me
as
soon
as
i
had
emptied
my
first
glass
said
if
you
drink
another
i
will
send
you
from
the
table
a
little
boy
like
you
should
not
drink
but
only
touch
the
glass
with
his
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
count
the
healths
which
were
drank
after
the
ladies
had
left
us
after
each
health
a
song
or
a
story
was
called
for
several
of
which
were
followed
by
applause
shouts
of
joy
and
convulsive
laughter
when
my
turn
to
propose
a
health
came
i
wished
to
be
excused
but
they
would
not
exempt
me
so
i
had
to
say
about
whose
health
i
was
most
interested
i
rose
upon
my
two
short
legs
and
turning
to
varin
i
said
let
us
drink
to
the
health
of
our
holy
father
the
nobody
had
yet
thought
of
our
holy
father
the
pope
and
the
name
mentioned
under
such
circumstances
by
a
child
appeared
so
droll
to
the
priests
and
their
merry
guests
that
they
burst
into
laughter
stamped
their
feet
and
shouted
bravo
bravo
to
the
health
of
the
pope
everyone
stood
up
and
at
the
invitation
of
varin
the
glasses
were
filled
and
emptied
as
usual
so
many
healths
could
not
be
drunk
without
their
natural
the
first
that
was
overcome
was
a
priest
noel
by
name
he
was
a
tall
man
and
a
great
drinker
i
had
noticed
more
than
once
that
instead
of
taking
his
he
drank
from
a
large
tumbler
the
first
symptoms
of
his
intoxication
instead
of
drawing
sympathy
from
his
friends
only
increased
their
noisy
bursts
of
laughter
he
endeavored
to
take
a
bottle
to
fill
his
glass
but
his
hand
shook
and
the
bottle
falling
on
the
floor
was
broken
to
pieces
wishing
to
keep
up
his
merriment
he
began
to
sing
a
bacchic
song
but
could
not
finish
he
dropped
his
head
on
the
table
quite
overcome
and
trying
to
rise
he
fell
heavily
upon
his
chair
while
all
this
took
place
the
other
priests
and
all
the
guests
looked
at
him
laughing
loudly
at
last
making
a
desperate
effort
he
rose
but
after
taking
two
or
three
steps
fell
headlong
on
the
floor
his
two
neighbors
went
to
help
him
but
they
were
not
in
a
condition
to
help
him
twice
they
rolled
with
him
under
the
table
at
length
another
less
affected
by
the
fumes
of
wine
took
him
by
the
feet
and
dragged
him
into
an
adjoining
room
where
they
left
him
this
first
scene
seemed
strange
enough
to
me
for
i
had
never
before
seen
a
priest
intoxicated
but
what
astonished
me
most
was
the
laughter
of
the
other
priests
over
that
spectacle
another
scene
however
soon
followed
which
made
me
sadder
my
young
companion
and
friend
achilles
tache
had
not
been
warned
as
i
had
only
to
touch
the
wine
with
his
lips
more
than
once
he
had
emptied
his
glass
he
also
rolled
upon
the
floor
before
the
eyes
of
his
father
who
was
too
full
of
wine
to
help
him
he
cried
aloud
i
am
choking
i
tried
to
lift
him
up
but
i
was
not
strong
enough
i
ran
for
his
mother
she
came
accompanied
by
another
lady
but
the
vicar
had
carried
him
into
another
room
where
he
fell
asleep
after
having
thrown
off
the
wine
he
had
taken
poor
achilles
he
was
learning
in
the
house
of
his
own
priest
to
take
the
first
step
of
that
life
of
debauchery
and
drunkenness
which
twelve
or
fifteen
years
later
was
to
rob
him
of
his
manor
take
from
him
his
wife
and
children
and
to
make
him
fall
a
victim
to
the
bloody
hand
of
a
murderer
upon
the
solitary
shores
of
kamouraska
this
first
and
sad
experience
which
i
made
of
the
real
and
intimate
life
of
the
roman
catholic
priest
was
so
deeply
engraved
on
my
memory
that
i
still
remember
with
shame
the
bacchic
song
which
that
priest
morin
had
taught
me
and
which
i
sang
on
that
occasion
it
commenced
with
these
latin
words
ego
in
arte
bacchi
multum
profeei
decies
pintum
vini
hodie
bibi
i
also
remember
one
sung
by
varin
here
it
is
pourquoi

when
the
priests
and
their
friends
had
sung
laughed
and
drank
for
more
than
an
hour
varin
rose
and
said
the
ladies
must
not
be
left
alone
all
the
evening
will
not
our
joy
and
happiness
be
doubled
if
they
are
pleased
to
share
them
with
us
this
proposition
was
received
with
applause
and
we
passed
into
the
where
the
ladies
awaited
us
several
pieces
of
music
well
executed
gave
new
life
to
this
part
of
the
entertainment
this
resource
however
was
soon
exhausted
besides
some
of
the
ladies
could
well
see
that
their
husbands
were
half
drunk
and
they
felt
ashamed
madam
tache
could
not
conceal
the
grief
she
felt
caused
by
what
had
happened
to
her
dear
achilles
had
she
some
presentiment
as
many
persons
have
of
the
tears
which
she
was
to
shed
one
day
on
his
account
was
the
vision
of
a
mutilated
and
bloody
corpse
of
her
own
drunken
son
fallen
dead
under
the
blow
of
an
assassin
s
dagger
before
her
eyes
varin
feared
nothing
more
than
an
interruption
in
those
hours
of
lively
pleasure
of
which
his
life
was
full
and
which
took
place
in
his
parsonage
well
well
ladies
and
gentlemen
let
us
entertain
no
dark
thoughts
on
this
evening
the
happiest
of
my
life
let
us
play
blind
man
s
let
us
play
blind
man
s
buff
was
repeated
by
everybody
on
hearing
this
noise
the
gentlemen
who
were
half
asleep
by
the
fumes
of
wine
seemed
to
awaken
as
if
from
a
long
dream
young
gentlemen
clapped
their
hands
ladies
young
and
old
congratulated
one
another
on
the
happy
idea
but
whose
eyes
shall
be
covered
first
asked
the
priest
yours
varin
cried
all
the
ladies
we
look
to
you
for
the
good
example
and
we
shall
follow
the
power
and
unanimity
of
the
jury
by
which
i
am
condemned
can
not
be
resisted
i
feel
that
there
is
no
appeal
i
must
illustration
festivities
in
a
parsonage
immediately
one
of
the
ladies
placed
her
nicely
perfumed
handkerchief
over
the
eyes
of
her
priest
took
him
by
the
hand
led
him
to
an
angle
of
the
room
and
having
pushed
him
gently
with
her
delicate
hand
said
mr
blindman
let
everyone
flee
woe
to
him
who
is
caught
there
is
nothing
more
curious
and
comical
than
to
see
a
man
walk
when
he
is
under
the
influence
of
wine
especially
if
he
wishes
nobody
to
notice
it
how
stiff
and
straight
he
keeps
his
legs
how
learned
and
complicated
in
order
to
keep
his
equilibrium
are
his
motions
to
right
and
left
such
was
the
position
of
priest
varin
he
was
not
drunk
though
he
had
taken
a
large
quantity
of
wine
he
did
not
fall
he
carried
with
wonderful
courage
the
weight
with
which
he
was
laden
the
wine
which
he
had
drank
would
have
intoxicated
three
ordinary
men
but
such
was
his
capacity
for
drinking
that
he
could
still
walk
without
falling
however
his
condition
was
sadly
betrayed
by
each
step
he
took
and
by
each
word
he
spoke
nothing
therefore
was
more
comical
than
the
first
steps
of
the
poor
priest
in
his
efforts
to
lay
hold
of
somebody
in
order
to
pass
his
band
to
him
he
would
take
one
forward
and
two
backward
steps
and
would
then
stagger
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
everybody
laughed
to
tears
one
after
another
they
would
all
either
pinch
him
or
touch
him
gently
on
his
hand
arm
or
shoulder
and
passing
rapidly
off
would
exclaim
run
away
the
priest
went
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
threw
his
arms
suddenly
now
here
and
then
there
his
legs
evidently
bent
under
their
burden
he
panted
perspired
coughed
and
everyone
began
to
fear
that
the
trial
might
be
carried
too
far
and
beyond
propriety
but
suddenly
by
a
happy
turn
he
caught
the
arm
of
a
lady
who
in
teasing
him
had
come
too
near
in
vain
the
lady
tries
to
escape
she
struggles
turns
round
but
the
priest
s
hand
holds
her
firmly
while
holding
his
victim
with
his
right
hand
he
wishes
to
touch
her
head
with
his
left
in
order
to
know
and
name
the
pretty
bird
he
had
caught
but
at
that
moment
his
legs
gave
way
he
falls
and
drags
with
him
his
beautiful
parishioner
she
turns
upon
him
in
order
to
escape
but
he
soon
turns
on
her
in
order
to
hold
her
better
all
this
though
the
affair
of
a
moment
was
long
enough
to
cause
the
ladies
to
blush
and
cover
their
faces
never
in
all
my
life
did
i
see
anything
so
shameful
as
that
scene
this
ended
the
game
everyone
felt
ashamed
i
make
a
mistake
when
i
say
because
the
men
were
almost
all
too
intoxicated
to
blush
the
priests
also
were
either
too
drunk
or
too
much
accustomed
to
such
scenes
to
be
ashamed
on
the
following
day
every
one
of
those
priests
celebrated
mass
and
ate
what
they
called
the
body
and
blood
the
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
just
as
if
they
had
spent
the
previous
evening
in
prayer
and
meditation
on
the
laws
of
god
he
varin
was
the
of
the
important
part
of
the
diocese
of
quebec
from
la
riviere
ouelle
to
gaspe
thus
o
perfidious
church
of
rome
thou
deceivest
the
nations
who
follow
thee
and
ruinest
even
the
priests
whom
thou
makest
thy
slaves
chapter
vii
preparation
for
the
first
to
idolatry
nothing
can
exceed
the
care
with
which
roman
catholic
priests
prepare
children
for
their
first
communion
two
and
three
months
are
set
apart
every
year
for
that
purpose
all
that
time
the
children
between
ten
and
twelve
years
of
age
are
obliged
to
go
to
church
almost
every
day
not
only
to
learn
by
heart
their
catechism
but
to
hear
the
explanations
of
all
its
teachings
the
priest
who
instructed
us
was
the
rev
morin
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
he
was
exceedingly
kind
to
children
and
we
respected
and
loved
him
sincerely
his
instructions
to
us
were
somewhat
long
but
we
liked
to
hear
him
for
he
always
had
some
new
and
interesting
stories
to
give
us
the
catechism
taught
as
a
preparation
for
our
first
communion
was
the
foundation
of
the
idolatries
and
superstitions
which
the
church
of
rome
gives
as
the
religion
of
christ
it
is
by
means
of
that
catechetical
instruction
that
she
obtains
for
the
pope
and
his
representatives
that
profound
respect
i
might
say
adoration
which
is
the
secret
of
her
power
and
influence
with
this
catechism
rome
corrupts
the
most
sacred
truths
of
the
gospel
it
is
there
that
jesus
is
removed
from
the
hearts
for
which
he
paid
so
great
a
price
and
that
mary
is
put
in
his
place
but
the
great
iniquity
of
substituting
mary
for
jesus
is
so
skillfully
concealed
it
is
given
with
colors
so
poetic
and
beautiful
and
so
well
adapted
to
captivate
human
nature
that
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
poor
child
to
escape
the
snare
one
day
the
priest
said
to
me
stand
up
my
child
in
order
to
answer
the
many
important
questions
which
i
have
to
ask
i
stood
up
my
child
he
said
when
you
had
been
guilty
of
some
fault
at
home
who
was
the
first
to
punish
father
or
your
mother
after
a
few
moments
hesitation
i
answered
my
you
have
answered
correctly
my
child
said
the
priest
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
father
is
almost
always
more
impatient
with
his
children
and
more
ready
to
punish
them
than
the
now
my
child
tell
us
who
punished
you
most
father
or
your
mother
my
father
i
said
without
hesitation
still
true
my
child
the
superior
goodness
of
a
kind
mother
is
perceived
even
in
the
act
of
correction
her
blows
are
lighter
than
those
of
the
father
further
when
you
had
deserved
to
be
chastised
did
not
one
sometimes
come
between
you
and
your
father
s
rod
taking
it
away
from
him
and
pacifying
him
yes
i
said
mother
did
that
very
often
and
saved
me
from
severe
punishment
more
than
that
is
so
my
child
not
only
for
you
but
for
all
your
companions
here
have
not
your
good
mothers
my
children
often
saved
you
from
your
fathers
corrections
even
when
you
deserved
it
answer
yes
sir
they
all
answered
one
question
more
when
your
father
was
coming
to
whip
you
did
you
not
throw
yourself
into
the
arms
of
some
one
to
escape
yes
sir
when
guilty
of
something
more
than
once
i
threw
myself
into
my
mother
s
arms
as
soon
as
i
saw
my
father
coming
to
whip
me
she
begged
pardon
for
me
and
pleaded
so
well
that
i
often
escaped
you
have
answered
well
said
the
priest
then
turning
to
the
children
he
continued
you
have
a
father
and
a
mother
in
heaven
dear
children
your
father
is
jesus
and
your
mother
is
mary
do
not
forget
that
a
mother
s
heart
is
always
more
tender
and
more
prone
to
mercy
than
that
of
a
father
often
you
offend
your
father
by
your
sins
you
make
him
angry
against
you
what
takes
place
in
heaven
then
your
father
in
heaven
takes
his
rod
to
punish
you
he
threatens
to
crush
you
down
with
his
roaring
thunder
he
opens
the
gates
of
hell
to
cast
you
into
it
and
you
would
have
been
damned
long
ago
had
it
not
been
for
the
loving
mother
whom
you
have
in
heaven
who
has
disarmed
your
angry
and
irritated
father
when
jesus
would
punish
you
as
you
deserve
the
good
virgin
mary
hastens
to
him
and
pacifies
him
she
places
herself
between
him
and
you
and
prevents
him
from
smiting
you
she
speaks
in
your
favor
she
asks
for
your
pardon
and
she
obtains
it
also
as
young
chiniquy
has
told
you
he
often
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
mother
to
escape
punishment
she
took
his
part
and
pleaded
so
well
that
his
father
yielded
and
put
away
the
rod
thus
my
children
when
your
conscience
tells
you
that
you
are
guilty
that
jesus
is
angry
against
you
and
that
you
have
good
reason
to
fear
hell
hasten
to
mary
throw
yourselves
into
the
arms
of
that
good
mother
have
recourse
to
her
sovereign
power
over
jesus
and
be
assured
that
you
will
be
saved
through
her
it
is
thus
that
the
pope
and
the
priests
of
rome
have
entirely
disfigured
and
changed
the
holy
religion
of
the
gospel
in
the
church
of
rome
it
is
not
jesus
but
mary
who
represents
the
infinite
love
and
mercy
of
god
for
the
sinner
the
sinner
is
not
advised
or
directed
to
place
his
hope
in
jesus
but
in
mary
for
his
escape
from
deserved
chastisement
it
is
not
jesus
but
mary
who
saves
the
sinner
jesus
is
always
bent
on
punishing
sinners
mary
is
always
merciful
to
them
the
church
of
rome
has
thus
fallen
into
idolatry
she
rather
trusts
in
mary
than
in
jesus
she
constantly
invites
sinners
to
turn
their
thoughts
their
hopes
their
affections
not
to
jesus
but
to
mary
by
means
of
that
impious
doctrine
rome
deceives
the
intellects
seduces
the
hearts
and
destroys
the
souls
of
the
young
forever
under
the
pretext
of
honoring
the
virgin
mary
she
insults
her
by
outraging
and
misrepresenting
her
adorable
son
rome
has
brought
back
the
idolatry
of
old
paganism
under
a
new
name
she
has
replaced
upon
her
altars
the
jupiter
tonans
of
the
greeks
and
romans
only
she
places
upon
his
shoulders
the
mantle
and
she
writes
on
the
forehead
of
her
idol
the
name
of
jesus
in
order
the
better
to
deceive
the
world
chapter
viii
the
first
communion
for
the
roman
catholic
child
how
beautiful
and
yet
how
sad
is
the
day
of
his
first
communion
how
many
joys
and
anxieties
by
turn
rise
in
his
soul
when
for
the
first
time
he
is
about
to
eat
what
he
has
been
taught
to
believe
to
be
his
god
how
many
efforts
he
has
to
make
in
order
to
destroy
the
manifest
teachings
of
his
own
rational
faculties
i
confess
with
deep
regret
that
i
had
almost
destroyed
my
reason
in
order
to
prepare
myself
for
my
first
communion
yes
i
was
almost
exhausted
when
the
day
came
that
i
had
to
eat
what
the
priest
had
assured
us
was
the
true
body
the
true
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
i
was
about
to
eat
him
not
in
a
symbolical
or
commemorative
but
in
a
literal
way
i
was
to
eat
his
flesh
his
bones
his
hands
his
feet
his
head
his
whole
body
i
had
to
believe
this
or
be
cast
forever
into
hell
while
all
the
time
my
eyes
my
hands
my
mouth
my
tongue
my
reason
told
me
that
what
i
was
eating
was
only
bread
has
there
ever
been
or
will
there
ever
be
a
priest
or
a
layman
to
believe
what
the
church
of
rome
teaches
on
this
dreadful
mystery
of
the
real
presence
shall
i
say
that
i
believed
in
the
real
presence
of
jesus
christ
in
the
communion
i
believed
in
it
as
all
those
who
are
good
roman
catholics
believe
i
believed
as
a
perfect
idiot
or
a
corpse
believes
whatever
is
essential
to
a
reasonable
act
of
faith
had
been
destroyed
in
me
on
that
point
as
it
is
destroyed
in
every
priest
and
layman
in
the
church
of
rome
my
reason
as
well
as
my
external
senses
had
been
as
much
as
possible
sacrificed
at
the
feet
of
that
terrible
modern
god
the
pope
i
had
been
guilty
of
the
incredibly
foolish
act
of
which
all
good
roman
catholics
are
had
said
to
my
intellectual
faculties
and
to
all
my
senses
hush
you
are
liars
i
had
believed
to
this
day
that
you
had
been
given
to
me
by
god
in
order
to
enable
me
to
walk
in
the
dark
paths
of
life
but
behold
the
holy
pope
teaches
me
that
you
are
only
instruments
of
the
devil
to
deceive
me
what
is
a
man
who
resigns
his
intellectual
liberty
and
who
cares
not
to
believe
in
the
testimony
of
his
senses
is
he
not
acting
the
part
of
one
who
has
no
gift
or
power
of
intelligence
a
good
roman
catholic
must
reach
that
point
that
was
my
own
condition
on
the
day
of
my
first
communion
when
jesus
said
if
i
had
not
come
and
spoken
unto
them
they
had
not
had
sin
but
now
they
have
no
cloak
for
their
sins
if
i
had
not
done
among
them
the
works
that
none
other
man
did
they
had
not
had
sin
but
now
have
they
both
seen
and
hated
both
me
and
my
father
john
xv
he
showed
that
the
sin
of
the
jews
consisted
in
not
having
believed
in
what
their
eyes
had
seen
and
their
ears
had
heard
but
behold
the
pope
says
to
roman
catholics
that
they
must
not
believe
in
what
their
hands
undoubtedly
handle
and
their
eyes
most
clearly
see
the
pope
sets
aside
the
testimony
most
approved
by
jesus
the
very
witnesses
invoked
by
the
son
of
god
are
ignominiously
turned
out
of
court
by
the
pope
as
false
witnesses
as
the
moment
of
taking
the
communion
drew
near
two
feelings
were
at
war
in
my
mind
each
struggling
for
victory
i
rejoiced
in
the
thought
that
i
would
soon
have
full
possession
of
jesus
christ
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
troubled
and
humbled
by
the
absurdity
which
i
had
to
believe
before
receiving
that
sacrament
though
scarcely
twelve
years
old
i
had
sufficiently
accustomed
myself
to
reflect
on
the
profound
darkness
which
covered
that
dogma
i
had
been
also
greatly
in
the
habit
of
trusting
my
eyes
and
i
thought
that
i
could
easily
distinguish
between
a
small
piece
of
bread
and
a
man
besides
i
extremely
abhorred
the
idea
of
eating
human
flesh
and
drinking
human
blood
even
when
they
assured
me
that
they
were
the
flesh
and
blood
of
jesus
christ
himself
but
what
troubled
me
most
was
the
idea
of
that
god
who
was
represented
to
me
as
being
so
great
so
glorious
so
holy
being
eaten
by
me
like
a
piece
of
common
bread
terrible
then
was
the
struggle
in
my
young
heart
where
joy
and
dread
trust
and
fear
faith
and
unbelief
by
turns
had
the
upper
hand
while
that
secret
struggle
known
only
to
god
and
to
myself
was
going
on
i
had
often
to
wipe
off
the
cold
perspiration
which
came
on
my
brow
with
all
the
strength
of
my
soul
i
prayed
to
god
and
the
holy
virgin
to
be
merciful
unto
me
to
help
and
give
me
sufficient
strength
and
light
to
pass
over
these
hours
of
anguish
the
church
of
rome
is
evidently
the
most
skillful
human
machine
the
world
has
ever
seen
those
who
guide
her
in
the
dark
paths
which
she
follows
are
often
men
of
deep
thought
they
understand
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
get
calm
honest
and
thinking
minds
to
receive
that
monstrous
dogma
of
the
real
corporal
presence
of
jesus
christ
in
the
communion
they
well
foresaw
the
struggle
which
would
take
place
even
in
the
minds
of
children
at
the
supreme
moment
when
they
would
have
to
sacrifice
their
reason
on
the
altar
of
rome
in
order
to
prevent
those
struggles
always
so
dangerous
to
the
church
nothing
has
been
neglected
to
distract
the
mind
and
draw
the
attention
to
other
subjects
than
that
of
the
communion
itself
first
at
the
request
of
the
parish
priest
helped
by
the
vanity
of
the
parents
themselves
the
children
are
dressed
as
elegantly
as
possible
the
young
communicant
is
clothed
in
every
way
best
calculated
to
flatter
his
own
vanity
also
the
church
building
is
pompously
decorated
the
charms
of
choice
vocal
and
instrumental
music
form
a
part
of
the
fete
the
most
odorous
incense
burns
around
the
altar
and
ascends
in
a
cloud
towards
heaven
the
whole
parish
is
invited
and
people
come
from
every
direction
to
enjoy
a
most
beautiful
spectacle
priests
from
the
neighboring
churches
are
called
in
order
to
add
to
the
solemnity
of
the
day
the
officiating
priest
is
dressed
in
the
most
costly
attire
this
is
the
day
on
which
silver
and
gold
are
displayed
before
the
eyes
of
the
wondering
spectators
often
a
lighted
wax
taper
is
placed
in
the
hand
of
each
young
communicant
which
itself
would
be
sufficient
to
draw
his
whole
attention
for
a
single
false
motion
would
be
enough
to
set
fire
to
the
clothes
of
his
neighbor
or
his
own
a
misfortune
which
has
happened
more
than
once
in
my
presence
now
in
the
midst
of
that
new
and
wonderful
spectacle
of
singing
latin
psalms
not
a
word
of
which
he
understands
in
view
of
gold
and
silver
ornaments
which
glitter
everywhere
before
his
dazzled
eyes
busy
with
the
holding
of
the
lighted
taper
which
keeps
him
constantly
in
fear
of
being
burned
alive
can
the
young
communicant
think
for
a
moment
of
what
he
is
about
to
do
poor
child
his
mind
ears
eyes
nostrils
are
so
much
taken
up
with
those
new
striking
and
wonderful
things
that
while
his
imagination
is
wandering
from
one
object
to
another
the
moment
of
communion
arrives
without
leaving
him
time
to
think
of
what
he
is
about
to
do
he
opens
his
mouth
and
the
priest
puts
upon
his
tongue
a
flat
thin
cake
of
unleavened
bread
which
either
firmly
sticks
to
his
palate
or
otherwise
melts
in
his
mouth
soon
to
go
down
into
his
stomach
just
like
the
food
he
takes
three
times
a
day
the
first
feeling
of
the
child
then
is
that
of
surprise
at
the
thought
that
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
the
upholder
of
the
universe
the
saviour
of
the
world
could
so
easily
pass
down
his
throat
now
follow
those
children
to
their
homes
after
that
great
and
monstrous
comedy
see
their
gait
listen
to
their
conversation
and
their
bursts
of
laughter
study
their
manners
their
coming
in
their
going
out
their
glances
of
satisfaction
on
their
fine
clothes
and
the
vanity
which
they
manifest
in
return
for
the
congratulations
they
receive
on
their
fine
dresses
notice
the
lightness
of
their
actions
and
conversation
immediately
after
their
communion
and
tell
me
if
you
find
anything
indicating
that
they
believed
in
the
terrible
dogma
they
have
been
taught
no
they
have
not
believed
in
it
neither
will
they
ever
do
so
with
the
firmness
of
faith
which
is
accompanied
by
intelligence
the
poor
child
thinks
he
believes
and
he
sincerely
tries
to
do
so
he
believes
in
it
as
much
as
it
is
possible
to
believe
in
a
most
monstrous
and
ridiculous
story
opposed
to
the
simplest
notions
of
truth
and
common
sense
he
believes
as
roman
catholics
believe
he
believes
as
an
idiot
believes
he
believes
as
a
corpse
believes
that
first
communion
has
made
of
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
a
real
machine
in
the
hands
of
the
pope
it
is
the
first
but
most
powerful
link
of
that
long
chain
of
slavery
which
the
priest
and
the
church
pass
around
his
neck
the
pope
holds
the
end
of
that
chain
and
with
it
he
will
make
his
victim
go
right
or
left
at
his
pleasure
in
the
same
way
that
we
govern
the
lower
animals
if
those
children
have
made
a
good
first
communion
they
will
be
submissive
to
the
pope
according
to
the
energetic
word
of
loyola
they
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
supreme
pontiff
of
rome
just
what
the
stick
is
in
the
hand
of
the
will
have
no
will
no
thought
of
their
own
and
if
god
does
not
work
a
miracle
to
bring
them
out
from
the
bondage
which
is
a
thousand
times
worse
than
the
egyptian
they
will
remain
in
that
state
during
the
rest
of
their
lives
my
soul
has
known
the
weight
of
those
chains
it
has
felt
the
ignominy
of
that
slavery
but
the
great
conqueror
of
souls
has
cast
down
a
merciful
eye
upon
me
he
has
broken
my
chains
and
with
his
holy
word
he
has
made
me
free
may
his
name
be
forever
blessed
chapter
ix
intellectual
education
in
the
roman
catholic
college
i
finished
at
the
college
of
nicolet
in
the
month
of
august
my
classical
course
of
study
which
i
had
begun
in
i
could
easily
have
learned
in
three
or
four
years
what
was
taught
in
those
seven
years
it
took
us
three
years
to
study
latin
grammar
when
twelve
months
would
have
sufficed
for
all
we
learned
of
it
it
is
true
that
during
that
time
we
were
taught
some
of
the
rudiments
of
the
french
grammar
with
the
elements
of
arithmetic
and
geography
but
all
this
was
so
superficial
that
our
teachers
often
seemed
more
desirous
to
pass
away
our
time
than
to
enlarge
our
understandings
i
can
say
the
same
thing
about
the
and
of
rhetoric
which
we
studied
two
years
a
year
of
earnest
study
would
have
sufficed
to
learn
what
was
taught
us
during
these
months
as
for
the
two
years
devoted
to
the
study
of
logic
and
of
the
subjects
classed
under
the
name
of
philosophy
it
would
not
have
been
too
long
a
time
if
those
questions
of
philosophy
had
been
honestly
given
us
but
the
student
in
the
college
of
the
church
of
rome
is
condemned
to
the
torments
of
tantalus
he
has
indeed
the
refreshing
waters
of
science
put
to
his
lips
but
he
is
constantly
prevented
from
tasting
them
to
enlarge
and
seriously
cultivate
the
intelligence
in
a
roman
catholic
college
is
a
thing
absolutely
out
of
the
question
more
than
that
all
the
efforts
of
the
principals
in
their
colleges
and
convents
tend
to
prove
to
the
pupil
that
his
intelligence
is
his
greatest
and
most
dangerous
it
is
like
an
untamable
animal
which
must
constantly
be
kept
in
chains
every
day
the
scholar
is
told
that
his
reason
was
not
given
him
that
he
might
be
guided
by
it
but
only
that
he
may
know
the
hand
of
the
man
by
whom
he
must
be
guided
and
that
hand
is
none
other
than
the
pope
s
all
the
resources
of
language
all
the
most
ingenious
sophisms
all
the
passages
of
both
the
fathers
and
the
holy
scriptures
bearing
on
this
question
are
arranged
and
perverted
with
inconceivable
art
to
demonstrate
to
the
pupil
that
his
reason
has
no
power
to
teach
him
anything
else
than
that
it
must
be
subjected
to
the
supreme
pontiff
of
rome
who
is
the
only
foundation
of
truth
and
light
given
by
god
to
guide
the
intelligence
and
to
enlighten
and
save
the
world
rome
in
her
colleges
and
convents
brings
up
or
raises
up
the
youth
from
their
earliest
years
but
to
what
height
does
she
permit
the
young
man
or
woman
to
be
raised
never
higher
than
the
feet
of
the
pope
as
soon
as
his
intelligence
guided
by
the
jesuit
has
ascended
to
the
feet
of
the
pope
it
must
remain
there
prostrate
itself
and
fall
asleep
the
pope
that
is
the
great
object
towards
which
all
the
intelligence
of
the
roman
catholics
must
be
converged
it
is
the
sun
of
the
world
the
foundation
and
the
only
support
of
christian
knowledge
and
civilization
what
a
privilege
it
is
to
be
lazy
stupid
and
sluggish
in
a
college
of
rome
how
soon
such
an
one
gets
to
the
summit
of
science
and
becomes
master
of
all
knowledge
one
needs
only
to
kiss
the
feet
of
the
pope
and
fall
into
a
perfect
slumber
there
the
pope
thinks
for
him
it
is
he
the
pope
who
will
tell
him
what
he
can
and
should
think
and
what
he
can
and
should
believe
i
had
arrived
at
that
degree
of
perfection
at
the
end
of
my
studies
and
j
barthe
being
editor
of
one
of
the
principal
papers
of
montreal
in
could
write
in
his
paper
when
my
manual
of
temperance
was
published
mr
chiniquy
has
crowned
his
apostleship
of
temperance
by
that
work
with
that
ardent
and
holy
ambition
of
character
of
which
he
gave
us
so
many
tokens
in
his
collegiate
life
where
we
have
been
so
many
years
the
witness
of
his
piety
when
he
was
the
model
of
his
fellow
students
who
had
called
him
the
louis
de
gonzague
of
these
words
of
the
montreal
member
of
parliament
mean
only
that
wishing
to
be
saved
as
louis
de
gonzague
i
had
blindly
tied
myself
to
the
feet
of
my
superiors
i
had
as
much
as
possible
extinguished
all
the
enlightenments
of
my
own
mind
to
follow
the
reason
and
the
will
of
my
superiors
these
compliments
mean
that
i
was
walking
like
a
blind
man
whom
his
guide
holds
by
the
hand
though
my
intelligence
often
revolted
against
the
fables
with
which
i
was
nurtured
i
yet
forced
myself
to
accept
them
as
gospel
truths
and
though
i
often
rebelled
against
the
ridiculous
sophisms
which
were
babbled
to
me
as
the
only
principles
of
truth
and
christian
philosophy
yet
as
often
did
i
impose
silence
on
my
reason
and
force
it
to
submit
to
the
falsehoods
which
i
was
obliged
to
take
for
god
s
truth
but
as
i
have
just
confessed
it
notwithstanding
my
good
will
to
submit
to
my
superiors
there
were
times
of
terrible
struggle
in
my
soul
when
all
the
powers
of
my
mind
seemed
to
revolt
against
the
degrading
fetters
which
i
was
forced
to
forge
for
myself
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
when
in
the
following
terms
i
expressed
to
my
professor
in
philosophy
the
rev
charles
harper
doubts
which
i
had
conceived
concerning
the
absolute
necessity
of
the
inferior
to
submit
his
reason
to
his
superior
when
i
shall
have
completely
bound
myself
to
obey
my
superior
if
he
abuses
his
authority
over
me
to
deceive
me
by
false
doctrines
or
if
he
commands
me
to
do
things
which
i
consider
wrong
and
dishonest
shall
i
not
be
lost
if
i
obey
him
he
answered
you
will
never
have
to
give
an
account
to
god
for
the
actions
that
you
do
by
the
order
of
your
legitimate
superiors
if
they
were
to
deceive
you
being
themselves
deceived
would
be
responsible
for
the
error
which
you
would
have
committed
your
sin
would
not
be
imputed
to
you
as
long
as
you
follow
the
golden
rule
which
is
the
base
of
all
christian
philosophy
and
and
obedience
little
satisfied
with
that
answer
when
the
lesson
was
over
i
expressed
my
reluctance
to
accept
such
principles
to
several
of
my
fellow
students
among
them
was
joseph
turcot
who
died
some
years
ago
when
i
think
he
was
minister
of
public
works
in
canada
he
answered
me
the
more
i
study
what
they
call
their
principles
of
christian
philosophy
and
logic
the
more
i
think
that
they
intend
to
make
of
every
one
of
us
on
the
following
day
i
opened
my
heart
to
the
venerable
man
who
was
our
rev
leprohon
i
used
to
venerate
him
as
a
saint
and
love
him
as
a
father
i
frankly
told
him
that
i
felt
very
reluctant
in
submitting
myself
to
the
crude
principles
which
seemed
to
lead
us
into
the
most
abject
slavery
the
slavery
of
our
reason
and
intelligence
i
wrote
down
his
answer
which
i
give
here
my
dear
chiniquy
how
did
adam
and
eve
lose
themselves
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
how
did
they
bring
upon
us
all
the
deluge
of
evils
by
which
we
are
overwhelmed
is
it
not
because
they
raised
their
miserable
reason
above
that
of
god
they
had
the
promise
of
eternal
life
if
they
had
submitted
their
reason
to
that
of
their
supreme
master
they
were
lost
on
account
of
their
rebelling
against
the
authority
the
reason
of
god
thus
it
is
all
the
evils
the
errors
the
crimes
by
which
the
world
is
overflooded
come
from
the
same
revolt
of
the
human
will
and
reason
against
the
will
and
reason
of
god
god
reigns
yet
over
a
part
of
the
world
the
world
of
the
elect
through
the
pope
who
controls
the
teachings
of
our
infallible
and
holy
church
in
submitting
ourselves
to
god
who
speaks
to
us
through
the
pope
we
are
saved
we
walk
in
the
paths
of
truth
and
holiness
but
we
would
err
and
infallibly
perish
as
soon
as
we
put
our
reason
above
that
of
our
superior
the
pope
speaking
to
us
in
person
or
through
some
of
our
superiors
who
have
received
from
him
the
authority
to
guide
but
said
i
if
my
reason
tells
me
that
the
pope
or
some
of
those
other
superiors
who
are
put
by
him
over
me
are
mistaken
and
that
they
command
me
something
wrong
would
i
not
be
guilty
before
god
if
i
obey
them
you
suppose
a
thing
utterly
impossible
answered
leprohon
for
the
pope
and
the
bishops
who
are
united
to
him
have
the
promise
of
never
failing
in
the
faith
they
can
not
lead
you
into
any
errors
nor
command
you
anything
against
the
law
of
god
but
supposing
for
a
moment
that
they
would
commit
any
error
and
that
they
would
compel
you
to
believe
or
do
something
contrary
to
the
teachings
of
the
gospel
god
would
not
ask
of
you
any
account
of
an
error
committed
when
you
are
obeying
your
legitimate
i
had
to
content
myself
with
that
answer
which
i
put
down
word
for
word
in
my
note
book
but
in
spite
of
my
respectful
silence
the
rev
leprohon
saw
that
i
was
yet
uneasy
and
sad
in
order
to
convince
me
of
the
orthodoxy
of
his
doctrines
he
instantly
put
into
my
hands
the
two
works
of
de
maistre
le
pape
and
les
soirees
de
petersburg
where
i
found
the
same
doctrines
supported
my
superior
was
honest
in
his
convictions
he
sincerely
believed
in
the
sound
philosophy
and
christianity
of
his
principles
for
he
found
them
in
these
books
approved
by
the
infallible
i
will
mention
another
occurrence
to
show
the
inconceivable
intellectual
degradation
to
which
we
had
been
dragged
at
the
end
of
seven
years
of
collegiate
studies
about
the
year
the
curate
of
anne
de
la
parade
wrote
to
our
principal
rev
leprohon
to
ask
the
assistance
of
the
prayers
of
all
the
students
of
the
college
of
nicolet
in
order
to
obtain
the
discontinuance
of
the
following
calamity
for
more
than
three
weeks
one
of
the
most
respectable
farmers
was
in
danger
of
losing
all
his
horses
from
the
effects
of
a
sorcery
from
morning
to
night
and
during
most
of
the
night
repeated
blows
of
whips
and
sticks
were
heard
falling
upon
these
poor
horses
which
were
trembling
foaming
and
struggling
we
can
see
nothing
the
hand
of
the
wizard
remains
invisible
pray
for
us
that
we
may
discover
the
monster
and
that
he
may
be
punished
as
he
such
were
the
contents
of
the
priest
s
letter
and
as
my
superior
sincerely
believed
in
that
fable
i
also
believed
it
as
well
as
the
students
of
the
college
who
had
a
on
that
shore
of
abject
and
degrading
superstitions
i
had
to
land
after
sailing
seven
years
in
the
bark
called
a
college
of
the
church
of
rome
the
intellectual
part
of
the
studies
in
a
college
of
rome
and
it
is
the
same
in
a
convent
is
therefore
entirely
worthless
worse
than
that
the
intelligence
is
dwarfed
under
the
chains
by
which
it
is
bound
if
the
intelligence
does
sometimes
advance
it
is
in
spite
of
the
fetters
placed
upon
it
it
is
only
like
some
few
noble
ships
which
through
the
extraordinary
skill
of
their
pilots
go
ahead
against
wind
and
tide
i
know
that
the
priests
of
rome
can
show
a
certain
number
of
intelligent
men
in
every
branch
of
science
who
have
studied
in
their
colleges
but
these
remarkable
men
had
from
the
beginning
secretly
broken
for
themselves
the
chains
with
which
their
superiors
had
tried
to
bind
them
for
peace
sake
they
had
outwardly
followed
the
rules
of
the
house
but
they
had
secretly
trampled
under
the
feet
of
their
noble
souls
the
ignoble
fetters
which
had
been
prepared
for
their
understanding
true
children
of
god
and
light
they
had
found
the
secret
of
remaining
free
even
when
in
the
dark
cells
of
a
dungeon
give
me
the
names
of
the
remarkable
and
intelligent
men
who
have
studied
in
a
college
of
rome
and
have
become
real
lights
in
the
firmament
of
science
and
i
will
prove
that
of
them
have
been
persecuted
excommunicated
tortured
some
even
put
to
death
for
having
dared
to
think
for
themselves
galileo
was
a
roman
catholic
and
he
is
surely
one
of
the
greatest
men
whom
science
claims
as
her
most
gifted
sons
but
was
he
not
sent
to
a
dungeon
was
he
not
publicly
flogged
by
the
hands
of
the
executioner
had
he
not
to
ask
pardon
from
god
and
man
for
having
dared
to
think
differently
from
the
pope
about
the
motion
of
the
earth
around
the
sun
copernicus
was
surely
one
of
the
greatest
lights
of
his
time
but
was
he
not
censured
and
excommunicated
for
his
admirable
scientific
discoveries
france
does
not
know
any
greater
genius
among
her
most
gifted
sons
than
pascal
he
was
a
catholic
but
he
lived
and
died
excommunicated
the
church
of
rome
boasts
of
bossuet
the
bishop
of
meaux
as
one
of
the
greatest
men
she
ever
had
yes
but
has
not
veuillot
the
editor
of
the
who
knows
his
man
well
confessed
and
declared
before
the
whole
world
that
bossuet
was
a
disguised
protestant
where
can
we
find
a
more
amiable
or
learned
writer
than
montalembert
who
has
so
faithfully
and
bravely
fought
the
battle
of
the
church
of
rome
in
france
during
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
but
has
he
not
publicly
declared
on
his
that
that
church
was
an
apostate
and
idolatrous
church
from
the
day
that
she
proclaimed
the
dogma
of
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
has
he
not
virtually
died
an
excommunicated
man
for
having
said
with
his
last
breath
that
the
pope
was
nothing
else
than
a
false
god
those
pupils
of
roman
catholic
colleges
of
whom
sometimes
the
priests
so
imprudently
boast
have
gone
out
from
the
hands
of
their
jesuit
teachers
to
proclaim
their
supreme
contempt
for
the
roman
catholic
priesthood
and
papacy
they
have
been
near
enough
to
the
priest
to
know
him
they
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
that
the
priest
of
rome
is
the
most
dangerous
the
most
implacable
enemy
of
intelligence
progress
and
liberty
and
if
their
arm
be
not
paralyzed
by
cowardice
selfishness
or
hypocrisy
those
pupils
of
the
colleges
of
rome
will
be
the
first
to
denounce
the
priesthood
of
rome
and
demolish
her
citadels
voltaire
studied
in
a
roman
catholic
college
and
it
was
probably
when
at
their
school
that
he
nerved
himself
for
the
terrible
battle
he
has
fought
against
rome
the
church
will
never
recover
from
the
blow
which
voltaire
has
struck
at
her
in
france
cavour
in
italy
had
studied
in
a
roman
catholic
college
also
and
under
that
very
roof
it
is
more
than
probable
that
his
noble
intelligence
had
sworn
to
break
the
ignominious
fetters
with
which
rome
had
enslaved
his
fair
country
the
most
eloquent
of
the
orators
of
spain
castelar
studied
in
a
roman
catholic
college
but
hear
with
what
burning
eloquence
he
denounces
the
tyranny
hypocrisy
selfishness
and
ignorance
of
the
priests
papineau
studied
under
the
priests
of
rome
in
their
college
at
montreal
from
his
earliest
years
that
eagle
of
canada
could
see
and
know
the
priests
of
rome
as
they
are
he
has
weighed
them
in
the
balance
he
has
measured
them
he
has
fathomed
the
dark
recesses
of
their
principles
he
has
felt
his
shoulders
wounded
and
bleeding
under
the
ignominious
chains
with
which
they
dragged
our
dear
canada
in
the
mire
for
nearly
two
centuries
papineau
was
a
pupil
of
the
priests
and
i
have
heard
several
priests
boasting
of
that
as
a
glorious
thing
but
the
echoes
of
canada
are
still
repeating
the
thundering
words
with
which
papineau
denounced
the
priests
as
the
most
deadly
enemies
of
the
education
and
liberty
of
canada
he
was
one
of
the
first
men
of
canada
to
understand
that
there
was
no
progress
no
liberty
possible
for
our
beloved
country
so
long
as
the
priests
would
have
the
education
of
our
people
in
their
hands
the
whole
life
of
papineau
was
a
struggle
to
wrest
canada
from
their
grasp
everyone
knows
how
he
constantly
branded
them
without
pity
during
his
life
and
the
whole
world
has
been
the
witness
of
the
supreme
contempt
with
which
he
has
refused
their
services
and
turned
them
out
at
the
solemn
hour
of
his
death
when
in
france
wanted
to
be
free
she
understood
that
the
priests
of
rome
were
the
greatest
enemies
of
her
liberties
she
turned
them
out
from
her
soil
or
hung
them
to
her
gibbets
if
that
noble
country
of
our
ancestors
is
stumbling
and
struggling
in
her
tears
and
her
she
has
fallen
at
the
feet
of
her
her
valiant
arm
has
been
paralyzed
her
sword
broken
and
her
strong
heart
saddened
above
measure
is
it
not
because
she
had
most
imprudently
put
herself
again
under
the
yoke
of
rome
canada
s
children
will
continue
to
flee
from
the
country
of
their
birth
so
long
as
the
priest
of
rome
holds
the
influence
which
is
blasting
everything
that
falls
within
his
grasp
on
this
continent
as
well
as
in
europe
and
the
united
states
will
soon
see
their
most
sacred
institutions
fall
one
after
the
other
if
the
americans
continue
to
send
their
sons
and
daughters
to
the
jesuit
colleges
and
nunneries
when
in
the
warmest
days
of
summer
you
see
a
large
swamp
of
stagnant
and
putrid
water
you
are
sure
that
deadly
miasma
will
spread
around
that
diseases
of
the
most
malignant
character
poverty
sufferings
of
every
kind
and
death
will
soon
devastate
the
unfortunate
country
so
when
you
see
roman
catholic
colleges
and
nunneries
raising
their
haughty
steeples
over
some
commanding
hills
or
in
the
midst
of
some
beautiful
valleys
you
may
confidently
expect
that
the
and
the
manly
virtues
of
the
people
will
soon
progress
prosperity
will
soon
wane
away
to
be
replaced
by
superstition
idleness
drunkenness
ignorance
poverty
and
degradation
of
every
kind
the
colleges
and
nunneries
are
the
high
citadels
from
which
the
pope
darts
his
surest
missiles
against
the
rights
and
liberties
of
nations
the
colleges
and
nunneries
are
the
arsenals
where
the
most
deadly
weapons
are
night
and
day
prepared
to
fight
and
destroy
the
soldiers
of
liberty
all
over
the
world
the
colleges
and
nunneries
of
the
priests
are
the
secret
places
where
the
enemies
of
progress
equality
and
liberty
are
holding
their
councils
and
fomenting
that
great
conspiracy
the
object
of
which
is
to
enslave
the
world
at
the
feet
of
the
pope
the
colleges
and
nunneries
of
rome
are
the
schools
where
the
rising
generations
are
taught
that
it
is
an
impiety
to
follow
the
dictates
of
their
own
conscience
hear
the
voice
of
their
intelligence
read
the
word
of
god
and
worship
their
creator
according
to
the
rules
laid
down
in
the
gospel
it
is
in
the
colleges
and
nunneries
of
rome
that
men
learn
that
they
are
created
to
obey
the
pope
in
the
bible
must
be
burnt
and
that
liberty
must
be
destroyed
at
any
cost
all
over
the
world
chapter
x
moral
and
religious
instruction
in
the
roman
catholic
colleges
in
order
to
understand
what
kind
of
moral
education
students
in
roman
catholic
colleges
receive
one
must
only
be
told
that
from
beginning
to
the
end
they
are
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
in
which
nothing
but
paganism
is
breathed
the
models
of
eloquence
which
we
learned
by
heart
were
almost
exclusively
taken
from
pagan
literature
in
the
same
manner
pagan
models
of
wisdom
of
honor
of
chastity
were
offered
to
our
admiration
our
minds
were
constantly
fixed
on
the
masterpieces
which
paganism
has
left
the
doors
of
our
understanding
were
left
open
only
to
receive
the
rays
of
light
which
paganism
has
shed
on
the
world
homer
socrates
lycurgus
virgil
horace
cicero
tacitus
cรฆsar
xenophon
demosthenes
alexander
lucretia
regulus
brutus
jupiter
venus
minerva
mars
diana
crowded
each
other
in
our
thoughts
to
occupy
them
and
be
their
models
examples
and
masters
for
ever
it
may
be
said
that
the
same
pagan
writers
orators
and
heroes
are
studied
read
and
admired
in
protestant
colleges
but
there
the
infallible
antidote
the
bible
is
given
to
the
students
just
as
nothing
remains
of
the
darkness
of
night
after
the
splendid
morning
sun
has
arisen
on
the
horizon
so
nothing
of
the
fallacies
superstitions
and
sophisms
of
paganism
can
trouble
or
obscure
the
mind
on
which
that
light
from
heaven
the
word
of
god
comes
every
day
with
its
millions
of
shining
rays
how
insignificant
is
the
poetry
of
homer
when
compared
with
the
sublime
songs
of
moses
how
pale
is
the
eloquence
of
demosthenes
cicero
virgil
when
read
after
job
david
or
solomon
how
quickly
tumble
down
the
theories
which
those
haughty
heathens
of
old
wanted
to
raise
over
the
intelligence
of
men
when
the
thundering
voice
from
sinai
is
heard
when
the
incomparable
songs
of
david
solomon
isaiah
or
jeremiah
are
ravishing
the
soul
which
is
listening
to
their
celestial
strains
it
is
a
fact
that
pagan
eloquence
and
philosophy
can
be
but
very
tasteless
to
men
accustomed
to
be
fed
with
the
bread
which
comes
down
from
heaven
whose
souls
are
filled
with
the
eloquence
of
god
and
whose
intelligence
is
fed
with
the
philosophy
of
heaven
but
alas
for
me
and
my
in
the
college
of
rome
no
sun
ever
appeared
on
the
horizon
to
dispel
the
night
in
which
our
intelligence
was
wrapped
the
dark
clouds
with
which
paganism
had
surrounded
us
were
suffocating
us
and
no
breath
from
heaven
was
allowed
to
come
and
dispel
them
moses
with
his
incomparable
legislation
david
and
solomon
with
their
divine
poems
job
with
his
celestial
philosophy
jeremiah
isaiah
and
daniel
with
their
sublime
songs
jesus
christ
himself
with
his
gospel
as
well
as
his
apostles
peter
john
jude
james
and
were
all
put
on
the
index
they
had
not
the
liberty
to
speak
to
us
and
we
were
forbidden
absolutely
forbidden
to
read
and
hear
them
it
is
true
that
the
church
of
rome
as
an
offset
to
that
gave
us
her
principles
precepts
fables
and
legends
that
we
might
be
attached
to
her
and
that
she
might
remain
the
mistress
of
our
hearts
but
these
doctrines
practices
principles
and
fables
seemed
to
us
so
evidently
borrowed
from
were
so
cold
so
naked
so
stripped
of
all
true
poetry
that
if
the
paganism
of
the
ancients
was
not
left
absolute
master
of
our
affections
it
still
claimed
a
large
part
of
our
souls
to
create
in
us
a
love
for
the
church
of
rome
our
superiors
depended
greatly
on
the
works
of
chateaubriand
the
genie
du
christianisme
was
the
book
of
books
to
dispel
all
our
doubts
and
attach
us
to
the
pope
s
religion
but
this
author
whose
style
is
sometimes
really
beautiful
destroyed
by
the
weakness
of
his
logic
the
christianity
which
he
wanted
to
build
up
we
could
easily
see
that
chateaubriand
was
not
sincere
and
his
exaggerations
were
to
many
of
us
a
sure
indication
that
he
did
not
believe
in
what
he
said
the
works
of
de
maistre
the
most
impudent
of
france
were
also
put
into
our
hands
as
a
sure
guide
in
our
philosophical
and
historical
studies
the
memoirs
du
comte
valmont
with
some
authors
of
the
same
stamp
were
much
relied
on
by
our
superiors
to
prove
to
us
that
the
dogmas
precepts
and
practices
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
were
brought
from
heaven
it
was
certainly
our
desire
as
well
as
our
interest
to
believe
them
but
how
our
faith
was
shaken
and
how
we
felt
troubled
when
livy
tacitus
cicero
virgil
homer
gave
us
the
evidence
that
the
greater
part
of
these
things
had
their
root
and
their
origin
in
paganism
for
instance
our
superiors
had
convinced
us
that
scapulars
medals
holy
water
would
be
of
great
service
to
us
in
battling
with
the
most
dangerous
temptations
as
well
as
in
avoiding
the
most
common
dangers
of
life
consequently
we
all
had
scapulars
and
medals
which
we
kept
with
the
greatest
respect
and
even
kissed
morning
and
evening
with
affection
as
if
they
were
powerful
instruments
of
the
mercy
of
god
to
us
how
great
then
was
our
confusion
and
disappointment
when
we
discovered
in
the
greek
and
latin
historians
that
those
scapulars
and
medals
and
statuettes
were
nothing
but
a
remnant
of
paganism
and
that
the
worshippers
of
jupiter
minerva
diana
and
venus
believed
themselves
also
free
as
we
did
from
all
calamity
when
they
carried
them
in
honor
of
these
divinities
the
further
we
advanced
in
the
study
of
pagan
antiquity
the
more
we
were
forced
to
believe
that
our
religion
instead
of
being
born
at
the
foot
of
calvary
was
only
a
pale
and
awkward
imitation
of
paganism
the
modern
maximus
pontifex
the
pope
of
rome
who
as
we
were
assured
was
the
successor
of
peter
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
resembled
the
pontifex
maximus
of
the
great
republic
and
empire
of
pagan
rome
as
two
drops
of
water
resemble
each
other
had
not
our
pope
preserved
not
only
the
name
but
also
the
attributes
the
pageantry
the
pride
and
even
the
garb
of
that
high
pagan
priest
was
not
the
worship
of
the
saints
absolutely
the
same
as
the
worship
of
the
demigods
of
olden
time
was
not
our
purgatory
minutely
described
by
virgil
were
not
our
prayers
to
the
virgin
and
to
the
saints
repeated
almost
in
the
same
words
by
the
worshippers
who
prostrated
themselves
before
the
images
of
their
gods
just
as
we
repeated
them
every
day
before
the
images
which
adorned
our
churches
was
not
our
holy
water
in
use
among
the
idolaters
and
for
the
same
purpose
for
which
it
is
used
among
us
we
knew
by
history
the
year
in
which
the
magnificent
temple
consecrated
all
the
bearing
the
name
of
pantheon
had
been
built
at
rome
we
were
acquainted
with
the
names
of
several
of
the
sculptors
who
had
carved
the
statues
of
the
gods
in
that
heathen
temple
at
whose
feet
the
idolaters
bowed
respectfully
and
words
can
not
express
the
shame
we
felt
on
learning
that
the
roman
catholics
of
our
day
under
the
very
eyes
and
with
the
sanction
of
the
pope
still
prostrated
themselves
before
the
same
idols
in
the
same
temple
and
to
obtain
the
same
favors
when
we
asked
each
other
the
question
what
is
the
difference
between
the
religion
of
heathen
rome
and
that
of
the
rome
of
more
than
one
student
would
answer
the
only
difference
is
in
the
name
the
idolatrous
temples
are
the
same
the
idols
have
not
left
their
places
as
formerly
the
same
incense
burns
in
their
honor
nations
are
still
prostrated
at
their
feet
to
give
them
the
same
homage
and
to
ask
of
them
the
same
favors
but
instead
of
calling
this
statue
jupiter
we
call
it
peter
and
instead
of
calling
that
one
minerva
or
venus
it
is
called
mary
it
is
the
old
idolatry
coming
to
us
under
christian
i
earnestly
desired
to
be
an
honest
and
sincere
roman
catholic
these
impressions
and
thoughts
distracted
me
greatly
inasmuch
as
i
could
find
nothing
in
reason
to
diminish
their
force
unfortunately
many
of
the
books
placed
in
our
hands
by
our
superiors
to
confirm
our
faith
form
our
moral
character
and
sustain
our
piety
and
our
confidence
in
the
dogmas
of
the
church
of
rome
had
a
frightful
resemblance
to
the
histories
i
had
read
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
the
miracles
attributed
to
the
virgin
mary
often
appeared
to
be
only
a
reproduction
of
the
tricks
and
deceits
by
which
the
priests
of
jupiter
venus
minerva
used
to
obtain
their
ends
and
grant
the
requests
of
their
worshippers
some
of
those
miracles
of
the
virgin
mary
equalled
if
they
did
not
surpass
in
absurdity
and
immorality
what
mythology
taught
us
among
the
most
hideous
accounts
of
the
heathen
gods
and
goddesses
i
could
cite
hundreds
of
such
miracles
which
shocked
my
faith
and
caused
me
to
blush
in
secret
at
the
conclusion
to
which
i
was
forced
to
come
in
comparing
the
worship
of
ancient
and
modern
rome
i
will
only
quote
three
of
these
modern
miracles
which
are
found
in
one
of
the
books
the
best
approved
by
the
pope
entitled
the
glories
of
first
miracle
the
great
favors
bestowed
by
the
holy
virgin
upon
a
nun
named
beatrix
of
the
convent
of
frontebraldo
show
how
merciful
she
is
to
sinners
the
fact
is
related
by
cesanus
and
by
father
rho
this
unfortunate
nun
having
been
possessed
by
a
criminal
passion
for
a
young
man
determined
to
leave
her
convent
and
elope
with
him
she
was
the
doorkeeper
of
the
convent
and
having
placed
the
keys
of
the
monastery
at
the
feet
of
a
statue
of
the
holy
virgin
she
boldly
went
out
then
led
a
life
of
prostitution
during
fifteen
years
in
a
far
off
place
one
day
accidentally
meeting
the
purveyor
of
her
convent
and
thinking
she
would
not
be
recognized
by
him
she
asked
him
news
of
sister
beatrix

know
her
well
answered
this
man
she
is
a
holy
nun
and
is
mistress
of
the
at
these
words
beatrix
was
confused
but
to
understand
what
it
meant
she
changed
her
clothing
and
going
to
the
convent
inquired
after
sister
beatrix
the
holy
virgin
instantly
appeared
to
her
in
the
form
of
the
statue
at
whose
feet
she
had
placed
the
keys
at
her
departure
the
divine
mother
spoke
to
her
in
this
wise

beatrix
that
in
order
to
preserve
your
honor
i
have
taken
your
place
and

sec
second
miracle
rev
father
rierenberg
relates
that
there
existed
in
a
city
called
aragona
a
beautiful
and
noble
girl
by
the
name
of
alexandra
whom
two
young
men
loved
passionately
one
day
maddened
by
the
jealousy
each
one
had
of
the
other
they
fought
together
and
both
were
killed
their
parents
were
so
infuriated
at
the
young
girl
the
author
of
these
calamities
that
they
killed
her
cut
her
head
off
and
threw
her
into
a
well
a
few
days
after
dominic
passing
by
the
place
was
inspired
to
approach
the
well
and
to
cry
out
alexandra
come
here
the
head
of
the
deceased
immediately
placed
itself
upon
the
edge
of
the
well
and
entreated
dominic
to
hear
its
confession
having
heard
it
the
saint
gave
her
the
communion
in
the
presence
of
a
great
multitude
of
people
and
then
he
commanded
her
to
tell
them
why
she
had
received
so
great
a
favor
she
answered
that
though
she
was
in
a
state
of
mortal
sin
when
she
was
decapitated
yet
as
she
had
a
habit
of
reciting
the
holy
rosary
the
virgin
had
preserved
her
life
the
head
full
of
life
remained
on
the
edge
of
the
well
two
days
before
the
eyes
of
a
great
many
people
and
then
the
soul
went
to
purgatory
but
fifteen
days
after
this
the
soul
of
alexandra
appeared
to
dominic
bright
and
beautiful
as
a
star
and
told
him
that
one
of
the
surest
means
of
removing
souls
from
purgatory
was
the
recitation
of
the
rosary
in
their
favor

chap
sec
third
miracle
a
servant
of
mary
one
day
went
into
one
of
her
churches
to
pray
without
telling
her
husband
of
it
owing
to
a
terrible
storm
she
was
prevented
from
returning
home
that
night
harassed
by
the
fear
that
her
husband
would
be
angry
she
implored
mary
s
help
but
on
returning
home
she
found
her
husband
full
of
kindness
after
asking
her
husband
a
few
questions
on
the
subject
she
discovered
that
during
that
very
night
the
divine
mother
had
taken
her
form
and
features
and
had
taken
her
place
in
all
the
affairs
of
the
household
she
informed
her
husband
of
the
great
miracle
and
they
both
became
very
much
devoted
to
the
holy
glories
of
mary
examples
of
protection
persons
who
have
never
studied
in
a
roman
catholic
college
will
hardly
believe
that
such
fables
were
told
us
as
an
appeal
for
us
to
become
christians
but
god
knows
i
tell
the
truth
is
it
not
a
profanation
of
a
holy
word
to
say
that
christianity
is
the
religion
taught
the
students
in
rome
s
colleges
after
reading
the
monstrous
metamorphoses
of
the
gods
of
olympus
the
student
feels
a
profound
pity
for
the
nations
who
have
lived
so
long
in
the
darkness
of
paganism
he
can
not
understand
how
so
many
millions
of
men
were
for
such
a
long
time
deceived
by
such
cruel
fables
with
joy
his
thoughts
are
turned
to
the
god
of
calvary
there
to
receive
light
and
life
he
feels
as
it
were
a
burning
desire
to
nourish
himself
with
the
words
of
life
fallen
from
the
lips
of
the
great
but
here
comes
the
priest
of
the
college
who
places
himself
between
the
student
and
christ
and
instead
of
allowing
him
to
be
nourished
with
the
bread
of
life
he
offers
him
fables
husks
with
which
to
appease
his
hunger
instead
of
allowing
him
to
slake
his
thirst
from
the
waters
which
flow
from
the
fountains
of
eternal
life
he
offers
him
a
corrupt
beverage
god
alone
knows
what
i
have
suffered
during
my
studies
to
find
myself
absolutely
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
eating
this
bread
of
holy
word
during
the
last
years
of
my
studies
my
superiors
often
confided
to
me
the
charge
of
the
library
once
it
happened
that
as
the
students
were
taking
a
holiday
i
remained
alone
in
the
college
and
shutting
myself
up
in
the
library
i
began
to
examine
all
the
books
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
discover
that
the
books
which
were
the
most
proper
to
instruct
us
stood
on
the
catalogue
of
the
library
marked
among
the
forbidden
books
i
felt
an
inexpressible
shame
on
seeing
with
my
own
eyes
that
none
but
the
most
indifferent
books
were
placed
in
our
we
were
permitted
to
read
authors
of
the
third
rank
only
if
this
expression
is
suitable
to
such
whose
only
merit
consisted
in
flattering
the
popes
and
in
concealing
or
excusing
their
crimes
several
students
more
advanced
than
myself
had
already
made
the
observation
to
me
but
i
did
not
believe
them
gave
me
the
hope
that
i
was
as
well
educated
as
one
could
be
at
my
age
until
then
i
have
spurned
the
idea
that
with
the
rest
of
the
students
i
was
the
victim
of
an
incredible
system
of
moral
and
intellectual
blindness
among
the
forbidden
books
of
the
college
i
found
a
splendid
bible
it
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
edition
as
the
one
whose
perusal
had
made
hours
pass
away
so
pleasantly
when
i
was
at
home
with
my
mother
i
seized
it
with
the
transports
of
a
miser
finding
a
lost
treasure
i
lifted
it
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
respectfully
i
pressed
it
against
my
heart
as
one
embraces
a
friend
from
whom
he
has
long
been
separated
this
bible
brought
back
to
my
memory
the
most
delightful
hours
of
my
life
i
read
its
divine
pages
until
the
scholars
returned
the
next
day
rev
leprohon
our
director
called
me
to
his
room
during
the
recreation
and
said
you
seem
to
be
troubled
and
very
sad
i
noticed
that
you
remained
alone
while
the
other
scholars
were
enjoying
themselves
so
well
have
you
any
cause
of
grief
or
are
you
sick
i
could
not
sufficiently
express
my
love
and
respect
for
this
venerable
man
he
was
at
the
same
time
my
friend
and
benefactor
for
four
years
he
and
rev
brassard
had
been
paying
my
board
for
owing
to
a
misunderstanding
between
myself
and
my
uncle
dionne
he
had
ceased
to
maintain
me
at
college
by
reading
the
bible
the
previous
day
i
had
disobeyed
my
benefactor
mr
leprohon
for
when
he
entrusted
me
with
the
care
of
the
library
he
made
me
promise
not
to
read
the
books
in
the
forbidden
catalogue
it
was
painful
to
me
to
sadden
him
by
acknowledging
that
i
had
broken
my
word
of
honor
but
it
pained
me
far
more
to
deceive
him
by
concealing
the
truth
i
therefore
answered
him
you
are
right
in
supposing
that
i
am
uneasy
and
sad
i
confess
there
is
one
thing
which
perplexes
me
greatly
among
the
rules
that
govern
us
i
never
dared
to
speak
to
you
about
it
but
as
you
wish
to
know
the
cause
of
my
sadness
i
will
tell
you
you
have
placed
in
our
hands
not
only
to
read
but
to
learn
by
heart
books
which
are
as
you
know
partly
inspired
by
hell
and
you
forbid
us
to
read
the
only
book
whose
every
word
is
sent
from
heaven
you
permit
us
to
read
books
dictated
by
the
spirit
of
darkness
and
sin
and
you
make
it
a
crime
for
us
to
read
the
only
book
written
under
the
dictation
of
the
spirit
of
light
and
holiness
this
conduct
on
your
part
and
on
the
part
of
all
the
superiors
of
the
college
disturbs
and
scandalizes
me
shall
i
tell
you
your
dread
of
the
bible
shakes
my
faith
and
causes
me
to
fear
that
we
are
going
astray
in
our
leprohon
answered
me
i
have
been
the
director
of
this
college
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
i
have
never
heard
from
the
lips
of
any
of
the
students
such
remarks
and
complaints
as
you
are
making
to
me
have
you
no
fear
of
being
the
victim
of
a
deception
of
the
devil
in
meddling
with
a
question
so
strange
and
so
new
for
a
scholar
whose
only
aim
should
be
to
obey
his
superiors
it
may
be
said
i
that
i
am
the
first
to
speak
to
you
in
this
manner
for
it
is
very
probable
that
i
am
the
only
student
in
this
college
who
has
read
the
holy
bible
in
his
youthful
days
i
have
already
told
you
there
was
a
bible
in
my
father
s
house
which
disappeared
only
after
his
death
though
i
never
could
know
what
became
of
it
i
can
assure
you
that
the
perusal
of
that
admirable
book
has
done
me
a
good
that
is
still
felt
it
is
therefore
because
i
know
by
a
personal
experience
that
there
is
no
book
in
the
world
so
good
and
so
proper
to
read
that
i
am
extremely
grieved
and
even
scandalized
by
the
dread
you
have
of
it
i
acknowledge
to
you
i
spent
the
afternoon
of
yesterday
in
the
library
reading
the
bible
i
found
things
in
it
which
made
me
weep
for
joy
and
that
did
more
good
to
my
soul
and
heart
than
all
you
have
given
me
to
read
for
six
years
and
i
am
so
sad
because
you
approve
of
me
when
i
read
the
works
of
the
devil
and
condemn
me
when
i
read
the
word
of
my
superior
answered
since
you
have
read
the
bible
you
must
know
that
there
are
things
in
it
on
matters
of
such
a
delicate
nature
that
it
is
improper
for
a
young
man
and
more
so
for
a
young
lady
to
read
i
understand
answered
i
but
these
delicate
matters
of
which
you
do
not
want
god
to
speak
a
word
to
us
you
know
very
well
that
satan
speaks
to
us
about
them
day
and
night
now
when
satan
speaks
about
and
attracts
our
thoughts
towards
an
evil
and
criminal
thing
it
is
always
in
order
that
we
may
like
it
and
be
lost
but
when
the
god
of
purity
speaks
to
us
of
evil
things
of
which
it
is
pretty
much
impossible
for
men
to
be
ignorant
he
does
it
that
we
may
hate
and
abhor
them
and
he
gives
us
grace
to
avoid
them
well
then
since
you
can
not
prevent
the
devil
from
whispering
to
us
things
so
delicate
and
dangerous
to
seduce
us
how
dare
you
hinder
god
from
speaking
of
the
same
things
to
shield
us
from
their
allurements
besides
when
my
god
desires
to
speak
to
me
himself
on
any
question
whatever
where
is
your
right
to
obstruct
his
word
on
its
way
to
my
heart
though
leprohon
s
intelligence
was
as
much
wrapped
up
in
the
darkness
of
the
church
of
rome
as
it
could
be
his
heart
had
remained
honest
and
true
and
while
i
respected
and
loved
him
as
my
father
though
differing
from
him
in
opinion
i
knew
he
loved
me
as
if
i
had
been
his
own
child
he
was
thunderstruck
by
my
answer
he
turned
pale
and
i
saw
tears
about
to
flow
from
his
eyes
he
sighed
deeply
and
looked
at
me
some
time
reflectingly
without
answering
at
last
he
said
my
dear
chiniquy
your
answer
and
your
arguments
have
a
force
that
frightens
me
and
if
i
had
no
other
but
my
own
personal
ideas
to
disprove
them
i
acknowledge
i
do
not
know
how
i
would
do
it
but
i
have
something
better
than
my
own
weak
thoughts
i
have
the
thoughts
of
the
church
and
of
our
holy
father
the
pope
forbid
us
to
put
the
bible
in
the
hands
of
our
this
should
suffice
to
put
an
end
to
your
troubles
to
obey
his
legitimate
superiors
in
all
things
and
everywhere
is
the
rule
a
christian
scholar
like
you
should
follow
and
if
you
have
broken
it
yesterday
i
hope
it
will
be
the
last
time
that
the
child
whom
i
love
better
than
myself
will
cause
me
such
on
saying
this
he
threw
his
arms
around
me
clasped
me
to
his
heart
and
bathed
my
face
with
tears
i
wept
also
yes
i
wept
abundantly
but
god
knoweth
that
though
the
regret
of
having
grieved
my
benefactor
and
father
caused
me
to
shed
tears
at
that
moment
yet
i
wept
much
more
on
perceiving
that
i
would
no
more
be
permitted
to
read
his
holy
word
if
therefore
i
am
asked
what
moral
and
religious
education
we
received
at
college
i
will
ask
in
return
what
religious
education
can
we
receive
in
an
institution
where
seven
years
are
spent
without
once
being
permitted
to
read
the
gospel
of
god
the
gods
of
the
heathen
spoke
to
us
daily
by
their
apostles
and
virgil
pindar
horace
and
the
god
of
the
christians
had
not
permission
to
say
a
single
word
to
us
in
that
college
our
religion
therefore
could
be
nothing
but
paganism
disguised
under
a
christian
name
christianity
in
a
college
or
convent
of
rome
is
such
a
strange
mixture
of
heathenism
and
superstition
both
ridiculous
and
childish
and
of
shocking
fables
that
the
majority
of
those
who
have
not
entirely
smothered
the
voice
of
reason
can
not
accept
it
a
few
do
as
i
did
all
in
their
power
and
succeed
to
a
certain
extent
in
believing
only
what
the
superior
tells
them
to
believe
they
close
their
eyes
and
permit
themselves
to
be
led
exactly
as
if
they
were
blind
and
a
friendly
hand
were
offering
to
guide
them
but
the
greater
number
of
students
in
roman
catholic
colleges
can
not
accept
the
bastard
christianity
which
rome
presents
to
them
of
course
during
their
studies
they
follow
its
rules
for
the
sake
of
peace
but
they
have
hardly
left
college
before
they
proceed
to
join
and
increase
the
ranks
of
the
army
of
skeptics
and
infidels
which
overruns
france
spain
italy
and
overruns
in
fact
all
the
countries
where
rome
has
the
education
of
the
people
in
her
hands
i
must
say
though
with
a
sad
heart
that
moral
and
religious
education
in
roman
catholic
colleges
is
worse
than
void
for
from
them
has
been
excluded
the
only
true
standard
of
morals
and
word
of
god
chapter
xi
children
in
the
convents
and
nunneries
of
we
read
in
the
history
of
paganism
that
parents
were
often
in
those
dark
ages
slaying
their
children
upon
the
altars
of
their
gods
to
appease
their
wrath
or
obtain
their
favors
but
we
now
see
a
stranger
thing
it
is
that
of
christian
parents
forcing
their
children
into
the
temples
and
to
the
very
feet
of
the
idols
of
rome
under
the
fallacious
notion
of
having
them
educated
while
the
pagan
parent
destroyed
only
the
temporal
life
of
his
child
the
christian
parent
for
the
most
part
destroys
his
eternal
life
the
pagan
was
consistent
he
believed
in
the
almighty
power
and
holiness
of
his
gods
he
sincerely
thought
that
they
ruled
the
world
and
that
they
blessed
both
the
victims
and
those
who
offered
them
but
where
is
the
consistency
of
the
protestant
who
drags
his
child
and
offers
him
as
a
sacrifice
on
the
altars
of
the
pope
does
he
believe
in
his
holiness
or
in
his
supreme
and
infallible
power
of
governing
the
intelligence
then
why
does
he
not
go
and
throw
himself
at
his
feet
and
increase
the
number
of
his
disciples
the
protestants
who
are
guilty
of
this
great
wrong
are
wont
to
say
as
an
excuse
that
the
superiors
of
colleges
and
convents
have
assured
them
that
their
religious
convictions
would
be
respected
and
that
nothing
should
be
said
or
done
to
take
away
or
even
shake
the
religion
of
their
children
our
first
parents
were
not
more
cruelly
deceived
by
the
seductive
words
of
the
serpent
than
the
protestants
are
this
day
by
the
deceitful
promises
of
the
priests
and
nuns
of
rome
i
had
been
myself
the
witness
of
the
promise
given
by
our
superior
to
a
judge
of
the
state
of
new
york
when
a
few
days
later
that
same
superior
the
rev
leprohon
said
to
me
you
know
some
english
and
this
young
man
knows
french
enough
to
enable
you
to
understand
each
other
try
to
become
his
friend
and
to
bring
him
over
to
our
holy
religion
his
father
is
a
most
influential
man
in
the
united
states
and
this
his
only
son
is
the
heir
of
an
immense
fortune
great
results
for
the
future
of
the
church
in
the
neighboring
republic
might
follow
his
i
replied
have
you
forgotten
the
promise
you
have
made
to
his
father
never
to
say
or
do
anything
to
shake
or
take
away
the
religion
of
that
young
man
my
superior
smiled
at
my
simplicity
and
said
when
you
shall
have
studied
theology
you
will
know
that
protestantism
is
not
a
religion
but
that
it
is
the
negation
of
religion
protesting
can
not
be
the
basis
of
any
doctrine
thus
when
i
promised
judge
pike
that
the
religious
convictions
of
his
child
should
be
respected
and
that
i
would
not
do
anything
to
change
his
faith
i
did
promise
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
since
i
promised
not
to
meddle
with
a
thing
has
no
convinced
or
rather
blinded
by
the
reason
of
my
superior
which
is
the
reasoning
of
every
superior
of
a
college
or
nunnery
i
set
myself
to
work
from
that
moment
to
make
a
good
roman
catholic
of
that
young
friend
and
i
would
probably
have
succeeded
had
not
a
serious
illness
forced
him
a
few
months
after
to
go
home
where
he
died
protestants
who
may
read
these
lines
will
perhaps
be
indignant
against
the
deceit
and
knavery
of
the
superior
of
the
college
of
nicolet
but
i
will
say
to
those
protestants
it
is
not
on
that
man
but
on
yourselves
that
you
must
pour
your
contempt
the
rev
leprohon
was
honest
he
acted
conformably
to
principles
which
he
thought
good
and
legitimate
and
for
which
he
would
have
cheerfully
given
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
he
sincerely
believed
that
your
protestantism
is
a
mere
negation
of
all
religion
worthy
of
the
contempt
of
every
true
christian
it
was
not
the
priest
of
rome
who
was
contemptible
dishonest
and
a
traitor
to
his
principles
but
it
was
the
protestant
who
was
false
to
his
gospel
and
to
his
own
conscience
by
having
his
child
educated
by
the
servants
of
the
pope
moreover
can
we
not
truthfully
say
that
the
protestant
who
wishes
to
have
his
children
bred
and
educated
by
a
jesuit
or
a
nun
a
man
of
no
and
that
nothing
is
more
ridiculous
than
to
hear
such
a
man
begging
respect
for
his
a
man
s
ardent
desire
to
have
his
religious
convictions
respected
is
best
known
by
his
respecting
them
himself
the
protestant
who
drags
his
children
to
the
feet
of
the
priests
of
rome
is
either
a
disguised
infidel
or
a
hypocrite
it
is
simply
ridiculous
for
such
a
man
to
speak
of
his
religious
convictions
or
beg
respect
for
them
his
very
humble
position
at
the
feet
of
a
jesuit
or
a
nun
begging
respect
for
his
faith
is
a
sure
testimony
that
he
has
none
to
lose
if
he
had
any
he
would
not
be
there
an
humble
and
abject
suppliant
he
would
take
care
to
be
where
there
could
be
no
danger
to
his
dear
child
s
immortal
soul
when
i
was
in
the
church
of
rome
we
often
spoke
of
the
necessity
of
making
superhuman
efforts
to
attract
young
protestants
into
our
colleges
and
nunneries
as
the
shortest
and
only
means
of
ruling
the
world
before
long
and
as
the
mother
has
in
her
hands
still
more
than
the
father
the
destinies
of
the
family
and
of
the
world
we
were
determined
to
sacrifice
everything
in
order
to
build
nunneries
all
over
the
land
where
the
young
girls
the
future
mothers
of
our
country
would
be
moulded
in
our
hands
and
educated
according
to
our
views
nobody
can
deny
that
this
is
supreme
wisdom
who
will
not
admire
the
enormous
sacrifices
made
by
romanists
in
order
to
surround
the
nunneries
with
so
many
attractions
that
it
is
difficult
to
refuse
them
preference
above
all
other
female
scholastic
establishments
one
feels
so
well
in
the
shade
of
these
magnificent
trees
during
the
hot
days
of
summer
it
is
so
pleasant
to
live
near
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
or
the
rapid
current
of
that
charming
river
or
to
have
constantly
before
one
s
eyes
the
sublime
spectacle
of
the
sea
what
a
sweet
perfume
the
flowers
of
that
parterre
diffuse
around
that
pretty
and
peaceful
convent
and
besides
who
can
withstand
the
almost
angelic
charms
of
the
lady
superior
how
it
does
one
good
to
be
in
the
midst
of
those
holy
nuns
whose
modesty
affable
appearance
and
lovely
smile
present
such
a
beautiful
spectacle
that
one
would
think
of
being
at
heaven
s
gate
rather
than
in
a
world
of
desolation
and
sin
o
foolish
man
thou
art
always
the
ready
to
be
seduced
by
glittering
ready
to
suppress
the
voice
of
thy
conscience
at
the
first
view
of
a
seductive
object
one
day
i
had
embarked
in
the
boat
of
a
fisherman
on
the
coast
of
one
of
those
beautiful
islands
which
the
hand
of
god
has
placed
at
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
of
lawrence
in
a
few
minutes
the
white
sail
by
the
morning
breeze
had
carried
us
nearly
a
mile
from
the
shore
there
we
dropped
our
anchor
and
soon
our
lines
carried
by
the
current
offered
the
deceitful
bait
to
the
fishes
but
not
one
would
come
one
would
have
thought
that
the
sprightly
inhabitants
of
these
limpid
waters
had
acted
in
concert
to
despise
us
in
vain
did
we
move
our
lines
to
and
fro
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
fishes
not
one
would
come
we
were
tired
we
lamented
the
prospect
of
losing
our
time
and
being
laughed
at
by
our
friends
on
the
shore
who
were
waiting
the
result
of
our
fishing
to
dine
nearly
one
hour
was
spent
in
this
manner
when
the
captain
said
indeed
i
will
make
the
fishes
opening
a
box
he
took
out
handfuls
of
little
pieces
of
fishes
and
threw
them
broadcast
on
the
water
i
was
looking
at
him
with
curiosity
and
i
received
with
a
feeling
of
unbelief
the
promise
of
seeing
in
a
few
moments
more
mackerel
than
i
could
pick
up
these
particles
of
fish
falling
upon
the
water
scattered
themselves
in
a
thousand
different
ways
the
rays
of
the
sun
sporting
among
these
numberless
fragments
and
thousands
of
scales
gave
them
a
singular
whiteness
and
brilliancy
they
appeared
like
a
thousand
diamonds
full
of
movement
and
life
that
sported
and
rolled
themselves
running
at
each
other
while
rocking
upon
the
waves
as
these
innumerable
little
objects
withdrew
from
us
they
looked
like
the
milky
way
in
the
firmament
the
rays
of
the
sun
continued
to
be
reflected
upon
the
scales
of
the
fishes
in
the
water
and
to
transform
them
into
as
many
pearls
whose
whiteness
and
splendor
made
an
agreeable
contrast
with
the
deep
green
color
of
the
sea
while
looking
at
that
spectacle
which
was
so
new
to
me
i
felt
my
line
jerked
out
of
my
hands
and
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
magnificent
mackerel
lying
at
my
feet
my
companions
were
as
fortunate
as
i
was
the
bait
so
generously
thrown
away
had
perfectly
succeeded
in
bringing
us
not
only
hundreds
but
thousands
of
fishes
and
we
caught
as
many
of
them
as
the
boat
could
carry
the
jesuits
and
the
nuns
are
the
pope
s
cleverest
fishermen
and
the
protestants
are
the
mackerels
caught
upon
their
baited
hooks
never
fisherman
knew
better
to
prepare
the
perfidious
bait
than
the
nuns
and
jesuits
and
never
were
stupid
fishes
more
easily
caught
than
protestants
in
general
the
priests
of
rome
themselves
boast
that
more
than
half
of
the
pupils
of
the
nuns
are
the
children
of
protestants
and
that
of
those
protestant
children
sooner
or
later
become
the
firmest
disciples
and
the
true
pillars
of
popery
in
the
united
states
it
is
with
that
public
and
undeniable
fact
before
them
that
the
jesuits
have
prophesied
that
before
years
the
pope
will
rule
that
great
republic
and
if
there
is
not
a
prompt
change
their
prophecy
will
probably
be
accomplished
but
say
many
protestants
where
can
we
get
safer
securities
that
the
morals
of
our
girls
will
be
sheltered
than
in
those
convents
the
faces
of
those
good
nuns
their
angelic
smiles
even
their
lips
from
which
seems
to
flow
a
perfume
from
not
these
the
unfailing
signs
that
nothing
will
taint
the
hearts
of
our
dear
children
when
they
are
under
the
care
of
those
holy
nuns
angelic
smiles
lips
from
which
flow
a
perfume
from
heaven
expressions
of
peace
and
holiness
of
the
good
nuns
delusive
allurements
cruel
deceptions
mockery
of
comedy
yes
these
angelic
smiles
all
these
expressions
of
joy
and
happiness
are
but
allurements
to
deceive
honest
but
too
trusting
men
i
believed
myself
for
a
long
time
that
there
was
something
true
in
all
the
display
of
peace
and
happiness
which
i
saw
reflected
in
the
faces
of
a
good
number
of
nuns
but
how
soon
my
delusions
passed
away
when
i
read
with
my
own
eyes
in
a
book
of
the
of
the
convent
that
one
of
their
rules
is
especially
in
the
presence
of
strangers
to
have
an
appearance
of
joy
and
happiness
even
when
the
soul
is
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
sorrow
the
motives
given
to
the
nuns
for
thus
wearing
a
continual
mask
is
to
secure
the
esteem
and
respect
of
the
people
and
to
win
more
securely
the
young
ladies
to
the
convent
all
know
the
sad
end
of
life
of
one
of
the
most
celebrated
female
comedians
of
the
american
theatre
she
had
acted
her
part
in
the
evening
with
a
perfect
success
she
appeared
so
handsome
and
so
happy
on
the
stage
her
voice
was
such
a
perfect
harmony
her
singing
was
so
merry
and
lively
with
mirth
two
hours
later
she
was
a
corpse
she
had
poisoned
herself
on
leaving
the
theatre
for
some
time
her
heart
was
broken
with
grief
which
she
could
not
bear
thus
it
is
with
the
nun
in
her
cell
forced
to
play
a
sacrilegious
comedy
to
deceive
the
world
and
to
bring
new
recruits
to
the
monastery
and
the
protestants
the
disciples
of
the
gospel
the
children
of
light
suffer
themselves
to
be
deceived
by
this
impious
comedy
the
poor
nun
s
heart
is
often
full
of
sorrow
and
her
soul
is
drowned
in
a
sea
of
desolation
but
she
is
obliged
under
oath
always
to
appear
gay
unfortunate
victim
of
the
most
cruel
deception
that
has
ever
been
invented
that
poor
daughter
of
eve
deprived
of
all
the
happiness
that
heaven
has
given
tortured
night
and
day
by
honest
aspirations
which
she
is
told
are
unpardonable
sins
she
has
not
only
to
suppress
in
herself
the
few
buds
of
happiness
which
god
has
left
in
her
soul
but
what
is
more
cruel
she
is
forced
to
appear
happy
in
anguish
of
shame
and
of
deception
ah
if
protestants
could
know
as
i
do
how
much
the
hearts
of
those
nuns
bleed
how
much
those
poor
victims
of
the
pope
feel
themselves
wounded
to
death
how
almost
every
one
of
them
die
at
an
early
age
instead
of
speaking
of
their
happiness
and
holiness
they
would
weep
at
their
profound
misery
instead
of
helping
satan
to
build
up
and
maintain
those
sad
dungeons
by
giving
both
their
gold
and
their
children
they
would
let
them
crumble
into
dust
and
thus
check
the
torrents
of
silent
though
bitter
tears
which
those
cells
hide
from
our
view
i
was
traveling
in
over
the
vast
prairies
of
illinois
in
search
of
a
spot
which
would
suit
us
the
best
for
the
colony
which
i
was
about
to
found
one
day
my
companions
and
myself
found
ourselves
so
wearied
by
the
heat
that
we
resolved
to
wait
for
the
cool
night
in
the
shade
of
a
few
trees
around
a
brook
the
night
was
calm
there
were
no
clouds
in
the
sky
and
the
moon
was
beautiful
like
the
sailor
upon
the
sea
we
had
nothing
but
our
compass
to
regulate
our
course
on
those
beautiful
and
vast
prairies
but
the
pen
can
not
express
the
emotions
i
felt
while
looking
at
that
beautiful
sky
and
those
magnificent
deserts
opened
to
our
view
we
often
came
to
sloughs
which
we
thought
deeper
than
they
really
were
and
of
which
we
would
keep
the
side
for
fear
of
drowning
our
horses
many
a
time
did
i
get
down
from
the
carriage
and
stop
to
contemplate
the
wonders
which
those
ponds
presented
to
our
view
all
the
splendors
of
the
sky
seemed
brought
down
in
those
pure
and
limpid
waters
the
moon
and
the
stars
seemed
to
have
left
their
places
in
the
firmament
to
bathe
themselves
in
those
delightful
lakelets
all
the
purest
the
most
beautiful
things
of
the
heavens
seemed
to
come
down
to
hide
themselves
in
those
tranquil
waters
as
if
in
search
of
more
peace
and
purity
a
few
days
later
i
was
retracing
my
steps
it
was
daytime
and
following
the
same
route
i
was
longing
to
get
to
my
charming
little
lakes
but
during
the
interval
the
heat
had
been
great
the
sun
very
hot
and
my
beautiful
sheets
of
water
had
been
dried
up
my
dear
little
lakes
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
what
did
i
find
instead
innumerable
reptiles
with
the
most
hideous
forms
and
filthy
colors
no
brilliant
stars
no
clear
moon
were
there
any
more
to
charm
my
eyes
there
was
nothing
left
but
thousands
of
little
toads
and
snakes
at
the
sight
of
which
i
was
filled
with
disgust
and
horror
protestants
when
upon
life
s
way
you
are
tempted
to
admire
the
smiling
lips
and
unstained
faces
of
the
pope
s
nuns
please
think
of
those
charming
lakes
which
i
saw
on
the
prairies
of
illinois
and
remember
the
innumerable
reptiles
and
toads
which
swarm
at
the
bottom
of
those
deceitful
waters
when
by
the
light
of
divine
truth
protestants
see
behind
these
perfect
mockeries
by
which
the
nun
conceals
with
so
much
care
the
hideous
misery
which
devours
her
heart
they
will
understand
the
folly
of
having
permitted
themselves
to
be
so
easily
deceived
by
appearances
then
they
will
bitterly
weep
for
having
sacrificed
to
that
modern
paganism
the
future
welfare
of
their
children
of
their
families
and
of
their
country
but
says
one
the
education
is
so
cheap
in
the
i
answer
the
education
in
convents
were
it
twice
cheaper
than
it
is
now
would
still
cost
twice
more
than
it
is
worth
it
is
in
this
circumstance
that
we
can
repeat
and
apply
the
old
proverb
cheap
things
are
always
too
highly
paid
in
the
first
place
the
intellectual
education
in
the
nunnery
is
completely
null
the
great
object
of
the
pope
and
the
nuns
is
to
captivate
and
destroy
the
intelligence
the
moral
education
is
also
of
no
account
for
what
kind
of
morality
can
a
young
girl
receive
from
a
nun
who
believes
that
she
can
live
as
she
pleases
as
long
as
she
likes
nothing
evil
can
come
of
her
neither
in
this
life
nor
in
the
next
provided
only
she
is
devout
to
the
virgin
mary
let
protestants
read
the
glories
of
mary
by
liguori
a
book
which
is
in
the
hands
of
every
nun
and
every
priest
and
they
will
understand
what
kind
of
morality
is
practiced
and
taught
inside
the
walls
of
the
church
of
rome
yes
let
them
read
the
history
of
that
lady
who
was
so
well
represented
at
home
by
the
holy
virgin
that
her
husband
did
not
perceive
that
she
had
been
absent
and
they
will
have
some
idea
of
what
their
children
may
learn
in
a
convent
chapter
xii
rome
and
does
the
church
of
rome
hate
the
common
schools
of
the
united
states
and
wants
to
destroy
them
why
does
she
object
to
the
reading
of
the
bible
in
the
school
the
word
education
is
a
beautiful
word
it
comes
from
the
latin
which
means
to
raise
up
to
take
from
the
lowest
degrees
to
the
highest
spheres
of
knowledge
the
object
of
education
is
then
to
feed
expand
raise
enlighten
and
strengthen
the
intelligence
we
hear
the
roman
catholic
priests
making
use
of
that
beautiful
word
education
as
often
if
not
oftener
than
the
protestant
but
that
word
education
has
a
very
different
meaning
among
the
followers
of
the
pope
than
among
the
disciples
of
the
gospel
and
that
difference
which
the
protestants
ignore
is
the
cause
of
the
strange
blunders
they
make
every
time
they
try
to
legislate
on
that
question
here
as
well
as
in
england
or
in
canada
the
meaning
of
the
word
education
among
protestants
is
as
far
from
the
meaning
of
that
same
word
among
roman
catholics
as
the
southern
pole
is
from
the
northern
pole
when
a
protestant
speaks
of
education
that
word
is
used
and
understood
in
its
true
sense
when
he
sends
his
little
boy
to
a
protestant
school
he
honestly
desires
that
he
should
be
reared
up
in
the
spheres
of
knowledge
as
much
as
his
intelligence
will
allow
when
that
little
boy
is
going
to
school
he
soon
feels
that
he
has
been
raised
up
to
some
extent
and
he
experiences
a
sincere
joy
a
noble
pride
for
this
new
though
at
first
very
modest
raising
but
he
naturally
understands
that
this
new
and
modest
upheaval
is
only
a
stone
to
step
on
and
raise
himself
to
a
higher
degree
of
knowledge
and
he
quickly
makes
that
second
step
with
an
unspeakable
pleasure
when
the
son
of
a
protestant
has
acquired
a
little
knowledge
he
wants
to
acquire
more
when
he
has
learned
what
means
he
wants
to
know
what
means
also
like
the
young
eagle
he
trims
his
wings
for
a
higher
flight
and
turns
his
head
upward
to
go
farther
up
in
the
atmosphere
of
knowledge
a
noble
and
mysterious
ambition
has
suddenly
seized
his
young
soul
then
he
begins
to
feel
something
of
that
unquenchable
thirst
for
knowledge
which
god
himself
has
put
in
the
breast
of
every
child
of
adam
a
thirst
of
knowledge
however
which
will
never
be
perfectly
realized
except
in
heaven
when
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
he
endowed
him
with
an
intelligence
and
moral
faculties
worthy
of
the
high
i
was
going
to
say
the
divine
dignity
of
his
own
beloved
children
he
himself
put
in
us
aspirations
and
instincts
by
which
we
were
to
be
constantly
longing
after
the
oceans
of
light
truth
and
knowledge
whose
waves
wash
his
eternal
throne
it
is
that
thirst
after
more
knowledge
that
constant
longing
after
more
light
which
constitutes
the
difference
between
man
and
brute
man
has
received
from
god
an
intelligence
which
though
clouded
now
by
sin
is
to
him
what
the
helm
is
to
the
noble
ship
which
crosses
the
boundless
ocean
he
has
a
conscience
an
immortal
soul
which
binds
him
to
god
and
he
feels
it
his
destinies
are
glorious
they
are
incommensurable
they
are
infinite
and
he
knows
it
though
a
dethroned
king
he
feels
that
he
is
still
a
king
the
six
thousand
years
which
have
passed
over
him
since
his
fall
have
not
yet
effaced
the
kingly
title
which
god
himself
wrote
on
his
forehead
when
he
told
him
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
i
with
that
glorious
that
divine
mission
of
subduing
the
air
and
the
light
the
wind
and
the
waves
the
seas
and
the
earth
the
roaring
thunder
and
the
flashing
lightning
constantly
before
his
eyes
man
marches
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
with
the
calm
certitude
of
his
power
and
the
glorious
aspirations
of
his
royal
dignity
the
object
of
education
then
is
to
enable
man
to
fulfill
that
kingly
mission
of
ruling
subduing
the
world
under
the
eyes
of
his
creator
let
us
remember
that
it
is
not
from
himself
nor
from
any
angel
but
it
is
from
god
himself
that
man
has
received
that
sublime
mission
yes
it
is
god
himself
who
has
implanted
in
the
bosom
of
humanity
the
knowledge
and
aspirations
of
those
splendid
destinies
which
can
be
attained
only
by
what
a
glorious
impulse
is
this
that
seizes
hold
of
the
newly
awakened
mind
and
leads
the
young
intelligence
to
rise
higher
and
pierce
the
clouds
that
hide
from
his
gaze
the
splendors
of
knowledge
that
lie
concealed
beyond
the
gloom
of
this
nether
sphere
that
impulse
is
a
noble
ambition
it
is
that
part
of
humanity
that
assimilates
itself
to
the
likeness
of
the
great
creator
that
impulse
which
education
has
for
its
mission
to
direct
in
its
onward
and
upward
march
is
one
of
the
most
precious
gifts
of
god
to
man
once
more
the
glorious
mission
of
education
is
to
foster
these
thirstings
after
knowledge
and
lead
man
to
accomplish
his
high
destiny
it
ought
to
be
a
duty
with
both
roman
catholics
and
protestants
to
assist
the
pupil
in
his
flight
toward
the
regions
of
science
and
learning
but
is
it
so
no
when
you
protestants
send
your
children
to
school
you
put
no
fetters
to
their
intelligence
they
rise
with
fluttering
wings
day
after
day
though
their
flight
at
first
is
slow
and
timid
how
happy
they
feel
at
every
new
aspect
of
their
intellectual
horizon
how
their
hearts
beat
with
an
unspeakable
joy
when
they
begin
to
hear
voices
of
applause
and
encouragement
from
every
side
saying
to
them
higher
higher
higher
when
they
shake
their
young
wings
to
take
a
still
higher
flight
who
can
express
their
joy
when
they
distinctly
hear
again
the
voices
of
a
beloved
mother
of
a
dear
father
of
a
venerable
pastor
cheering
them
and
saying
well
done
higher
yet
my
child
higher
raising
themselves
with
more
confidence
on
their
wings
they
then
soar
still
higher
in
the
midst
of
the
unanimous
concert
of
the
voices
of
their
whole
country
encouraging
them
to
the
highest
flight
it
is
then
that
the
young
man
feel
his
intellectual
strength
tenfold
multiplied
he
lifts
himself
on
his
eagle
wings
with
a
renewed
confidence
and
power
and
soars
up
still
higher
with
his
heart
beating
with
a
noble
and
holy
joy
for
from
the
south
and
north
from
the
east
and
the
west
the
echoes
bring
to
his
ears
the
voices
of
the
admiring
rise
higher
higher
yet
he
has
now
reached
what
he
thought
at
first
to
be
the
highest
regions
of
thought
and
knowledge
but
he
hears
again
the
same
stimulating
cries
from
below
encouraging
him
to
a
still
higher
flight
toward
the
loftiest
dominion
of
knowledge
and
philosophy
till
he
enters
the
regions
where
lies
the
source
of
all
truth
and
light
and
life
for
he
has
also
heard
the
voice
of
his
god
speaking
through
his
son
jesus
christ
crying
come
unto
me
fear
not
come
unto
me
i
am
the
light
the
way
come
to
this
region
where
the
father
with
the
son
and
the
spirit
reign
in
endless
light
thus
does
the
protestant
scholar
making
use
of
his
intelligence
as
the
eagle
of
his
wing
go
on
from
weakness
unto
strength
from
the
timid
flutter
to
the
bold
confident
flight
from
one
degree
to
another
still
higher
from
one
region
of
knowledge
to
another
still
higher
till
he
loses
himself
in
that
ocean
of
light
and
truth
and
life
which
is
god
in
the
protestant
schools
no
fetters
are
put
on
the
young
eagle
s
wings
there
is
nothing
to
stop
him
in
his
progress
or
paralyze
his
movements
and
upward
flights
it
is
the
contrary
he
receives
every
kind
of
encouragement
in
his
flight
thus
it
is
that
the
only
truly
nations
in
the
world
are
protestants
thus
it
is
the
truly
nations
in
the
world
are
protestants
thus
it
is
that
the
nations
in
the
world
are
protestants
the
protestant
nations
are
the
only
ones
that
acquit
themselves
like
men
in
the
arena
of
this
world
protestant
nations
only
march
as
giants
at
the
head
of
the
civilized
world
everywhere
they
are
the
advance
guard
in
the
ranks
of
progress
science
and
liberty
leaving
far
behind
the
unfortunate
nations
whose
hands
are
tied
by
the
ignominious
iron
chains
of
popery
after
we
have
seen
the
protestant
scholar
raising
himself
on
his
eagle
wings
to
the
highest
spheres
of
intelligence
happiness
and
light
and
marching
unimpaired
toward
his
splendid
destinies
let
us
turn
our
eyes
toward
the
roman
catholic
student
and
let
us
consider
and
pity
him
in
the
supreme
degradation
to
which
he
is
subjected
that
young
roman
catholic
scholar
is
born
with
the
same
bright
intelligence
as
the
protestant
one
he
is
endowed
by
his
creator
with
the
same
powers
of
mind
as
his
protestant
neighbor
he
has
the
same
impulses
the
same
noble
aspirations
implanted
by
the
hand
of
god
in
his
breast
he
is
sent
to
school
apparently
like
the
protestant
boy
to
receive
what
is
called
he
at
first
understands
that
word
in
its
true
sense
he
goes
to
school
in
the
hope
of
being
elevated
as
high
as
his
intelligence
and
his
personal
efforts
will
allow
his
heart
beats
with
joy
when
at
once
the
first
rays
of
light
and
knowledge
come
to
him
he
feels
a
holy
a
noble
pride
at
every
new
step
he
makes
in
his
upward
progress
he
longs
to
learn
more
he
wants
to
rise
higher
he
also
takes
up
his
wings
like
the
young
eagle
and
soars
up
higher
but
here
begin
the
disappointments
and
tribulations
of
the
roman
catholic
student
for
he
is
allowed
to
raise
but
when
he
has
raised
himself
high
enough
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
big
toes
of
the
pope
he
hears
piercing
angry
threatening
angry
cries
coming
from
every
stop
stop
do
not
raise
yourself
higher
than
the
toes
of
the
holy
pope
kiss
those
holy
toes
and
stop
your
upward
flight
remember
that
the
pope
is
the
only
source
of
science
knowledge
and
truth
the
knowledge
of
the
pope
is
the
ultimate
limit
of
learning
and
light
to
which
humanity
can
attain
you
are
not
allowed
to
know
and
believe
what
his
holiness
does
not
know
and
believe
stop
stop
do
not
go
an
inch
higher
than
the
intellectual
horizon
the
supreme
pontiff
of
rome
in
whom
only
is
the
plenitude
of
the
true
science
which
will
save
the
some
will
perhaps
answer
me
here
has
not
rome
produced
great
men
in
every
department
of
science
i
answer
yes
as
i
have
once
done
before
rome
can
show
us
a
long
list
of
names
which
shine
among
the
brightest
lights
of
the
firmament
of
science
and
philosophy
she
can
show
us
her
copernices
her
galileos
her
pascals
her
bossuets
her
lamenais
etc
but
it
is
at
their
risk
and
peril
that
those
giants
of
intelligence
have
raised
themselves
into
the
highest
regions
of
philosophy
and
science
it
is
in
spite
of
rome
that
those
eagles
have
soared
up
above
the
damp
and
obscure
horizon
where
the
pope
offers
his
big
toes
to
be
kissed
and
worshipped
as
the
plus
of
human
intelligence
and
they
have
invariably
been
punished
for
their
boldness
on
the
of
june
galileo
was
obliged
to
fall
on
his
knees
in
order
to
escape
the
cruel
death
to
which
he
was
to
be
condemned
by
the
order
of
the
pope
and
he
signed
with
his
own
hand
the
following
retractation
i
abjure
curse
and
detest
the
error
and
heresy
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
etc
that
learned
man
had
to
degrade
himself
by
swearing
a
most
egregious
lie
namely
that
the
earth
does
not
move
around
the
sun
thus
it
is
that
the
wings
of
that
giant
eagle
of
rome
were
clipped
by
the
scissors
of
the
pope
that
mighty
intelligence
was
bruised
fettered
and
as
much
as
it
was
possible
to
the
church
of
rome
degraded
silenced
and
killed
but
god
would
not
allow
that
such
a
giant
intellect
should
be
entirely
strangled
by
the
bloody
hands
of
that
implacable
enemy
of
light
and
pope
sufficient
strength
and
life
had
remained
in
galileo
to
enable
him
to
say
when
rising
up
this
will
not
prevent
the
earth
from
moving
the
infallible
decree
of
the
infallible
pope
urban
against
the
motion
of
the
earth
is
signed
by
the
cardinals
felia
guido
desiderio
antonio
bellingero
and
fabricicio
it
says
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
jesus
christ
the
plenitude
of
which
resides
in
his
vicar
the
pope
that
the
proposition
that
the
earth
is
not
the
center
of
the
world
and
that
it
moves
with
a
diurnal
motion
is
absurd
philosophically
false
and
erroneous
in
what
a
glorious
thing
for
the
pope
of
rome
to
be
infallible
he
infallibly
knows
that
the
earth
does
not
move
around
the
sun
and
what
a
blessed
thing
for
the
roman
catholics
to
be
governed
and
taught
by
such
an
being
in
consequence
of
that
infallible
decree
you
will
admire
the
following
act
of
humble
submission
of
two
celebrated
jesuit
astronomers
lesueur
and
jacquier
newton
assumes
in
his
third
book
the
hypothesis
of
the
earth
moving
around
the
sun
the
proposition
of
that
author
could
not
be
explained
except
through
the
same
hypothesis
we
have
therefore
been
forced
to
act
a
character
not
our
own
we
declare
our
entire
submission
to
the
decrees
of
the
supreme
pontiffs
of
rome
against
the
motion
of
the
newton
s
principia
vol
p
now
please
tell
me
if
the
world
has
ever
witnessed
any
degradation
like
that
of
roman
catholics
i
do
not
speak
of
the
ignorant
and
unlearned
but
i
speak
of
the
intelligent
ones
there
you
see
galileo
condemned
to
gaol
because
he
had
proved
that
the
earth
moved
around
the
sun
and
to
avoid
the
cruel
death
on
the
rack
of
the
holy
inquisition
if
he
does
not
retract
he
falls
on
his
knees
and
swears
that
he
will
never
believe
the
very
moment
that
he
believes
it
he
promises
under
a
solemn
oath
that
he
will
never
say
it
any
more
when
he
is
determined
to
proclaim
it
again
the
very
first
opportunity
and
here
you
see
two
other
learned
jesuits
who
have
written
a
very
able
work
to
prove
that
the
earth
moves
around
the
sun
but
trembling
at
the
thunders
of
the
vatican
which
are
roaring
on
their
heads
and
threaten
to
kill
them
they
submit
to
the
decrees
of
the
popes
of
rome
against
the
motion
of
the
earth
these
two
learned
jesuits
tell
a
most
contemptible
and
ridiculous
lie
to
save
themselves
from
the
implacable
wrath
of
that
great
whose
throne
is
in
the
city
of
the
seven
hills
lamenais
a
roman
catholic
priest
who
lived
in
this
very
century
was
one
of
the
most
profound
philosophers
and
eloquent
writers
which
france
has
ever
had
but
lamenais
was
publicly
excommunicated
for
having
raised
himself
high
enough
in
the
regions
of
gospel
light
to
see
that
liberty
of
conscience
was
one
of
the
great
privileges
which
christ
has
brought
from
heaven
for
all
the
nations
and
which
he
has
sealed
with
his
blood
no
man
has
ever
raised
himself
higher
in
the
regions
of
thought
and
philosophy
than
pascal
but
the
wings
of
that
giant
eagle
were
clipped
by
the
pope
pascal
was
an
outcast
in
the
church
of
rome
he
lived
and
died
an
excommunicated
man
bossuet
is
one
of
the
most
eloquent
orators
which
rome
has
given
to
the
world
but
veuillot
the
editor
of
the
the
official
journal
of
the
roman
catholic
clergy
of
france
assures
us
that
bossuet
was
a
disguised
protestant
if
at
any
step
made
by
the
protestant
through
the
regions
of
science
and
learning
he
asks
god
or
man
to
tell
him
how
he
can
proceed
any
further
without
any
fear
of
falling
into
some
unknown
and
unsuspected
abyss
both
god
and
man
tell
him
what
christ
said
to
his
he
has
eyes
to
see
ears
to
hear
and
an
intelligence
to
understand
he
is
reminded
that
it
is
with
his
own
eyes
and
not
with
another
s
eyes
he
must
look
that
it
is
with
his
own
ears
and
not
with
another
s
ears
he
must
hear
and
that
it
is
with
his
own
intelligence
and
not
another
s
intelligence
he
must
understand
and
when
the
protestant
has
made
use
of
his
own
eyes
to
see
and
his
own
ears
to
hear
and
his
own
intelligence
to
understand
he
nevertheless
feels
again
his
feet
uncertain
on
the
trembling
waves
of
the
mysterious
and
unexplored
regions
of
science
and
learning
which
spread
before
him
as
a
boundless
ocean
all
the
echoes
of
heaven
and
earth
bring
to
his
ears
the
simple
but
sublime
words
of
the
son
of
god
if
a
son
shall
ask
bread
of
any
of
you
that
is
a
father
will
he
give
him
a
stone
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
for
a
fish
give
him
a
serpent
or
if
he
shall
ask
an
egg
will
he
offer
him
a
scorpion
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
heavenly
father
give
the
holy
spirit
to
them
that
ask
him
emboldened
with
this
infallible
promise
of
the
saviour
which
has
ennobled
and
almost
divinized
him
the
protestant
student
ceases
to
tremble
and
fear
a
new
strength
has
been
given
to
his
feet
a
new
power
to
his
mind
for
he
has
gone
to
his
father
for
more
light
and
strength
nay
he
has
boldly
asked
not
only
the
assistance
and
the
help
of
the
spirit
of
god
but
the
very
presence
of
his
spirit
in
his
soul
to
guide
and
strengthen
him
the
assurance
that
the
great
god
who
has
created
heaven
and
earth
is
his
father
his
loving
father
has
absolutely
raised
him
above
himself
it
has
given
a
new
i
dare
say
a
divine
impulse
to
all
his
aspirations
for
truth
and
knowledge
it
has
put
into
his
breast
the
assurance
that
sustained
by
the
love
and
the
light
and
the
help
of
that
great
infinite
eternal
god
he
feels
himself
as
a
giant
able
to
cope
with
any
obstacle
he
does
not
any
more
walk
on
his
way
to
eternity
as
a
worm
of
the
dust
a
voice
from
heaven
has
told
him
that
he
was
the
child
of
god
eternity
and
not
time
then
becomes
the
limits
of
his
existence
he
is
no
more
satisfied
with
touching
with
his
hands
and
studying
with
his
eyes
the
few
objects
which
are
within
the
limited
horizon
of
the
he
stretches
his
giant
hands
to
the
boundless
limits
of
the
infinite
he
boldly
raises
his
feet
and
eyes
from
the
dust
of
this
earth
to
launch
himself
into
the
boundless
oceans
of
the
unknown
worlds
he
feels
as
if
there
was
almost
nothing
beyond
the
reach
of
his
intelligence
nothing
to
resist
the
power
of
his
arms
nothing
to
stop
his
onward
progress
toward
the
infinite
so
long
as
the
infallible
words
of
christ
shall
be
his
compass
his
light
and
his
strength
he
will
then
touch
the
mountains
and
they
will
melt
and
bow
down
before
him
to
let
his
iron
and
fiery
chariot
pass
over
the
rocky
mountains
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
he
will
boldly
ascend
to
the
regions
where
the
lightning
and
the
storms
reign
and
there
he
will
place
his
daring
hands
into
the
roaring
clouds
and
wrench
the
sparkle
of
lightning
which
will
carry
his
message
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
he
will
force
the
oceans
to
tremble
and
submit
as
humble
slaves
before
those
marvelous
which
like
giants
carry
floating
cities
over
all
the
seas
in
spite
of
the
winds
and
the
waves
had
the
newtons
the
franklins
the
fultons
the
morses
been
romanists
their
names
would
have
been
lost
in
the
obscurity
which
is
the
natural
heritage
of
the
abject
slaves
of
the
popes
being
told
from
their
infancy
that
no
one
had
any
right
to
make
use
of
his
private
judgment
intelligence
and
conscience
in
the
research
of
truth
they
would
have
remained
mute
and
motionless
at
the
feet
of
the
modern
and
terrible
god
of
rome
the
pope
but
they
were
protestants
in
that
great
and
glorious
word
protestant
is
the
secret
of
the
marvelous
discoveries
with
which
they
have
changed
the
face
of
the
world
they
were
protestants
yes
they
had
passed
their
young
years
in
protestant
schools
where
they
had
read
a
book
which
told
them
that
they
were
created
in
the
image
of
god
and
that
that
great
god
had
sent
his
eternal
son
jesus
to
make
them
free
from
the
bondage
of
man
they
had
read
in
that
protestant
book
for
the
bible
is
the
most
protestant
book
in
the
world
that
man
had
not
only
a
conscience
but
an
intelligence
to
guide
him
they
had
learned
that
that
intelligence
and
conscience
had
no
other
master
but
god
no
other
guide
but
god
no
other
light
but
god
on
the
walls
of
their
protestant
schools
the
son
of
god
had
written
the
marvelous
words
come
unto
me
i
am
the
light
the
way
the
but
when
the
protestant
nations
are
marching
with
such
giant
strides
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
why
is
it
that
the
roman
catholic
nations
not
only
remain
stationary
but
give
evidence
of
a
decadence
which
is
day
after
day
more
and
more
appalling
and
remediless
go
to
their
schools
and
give
a
moment
of
attention
to
the
principles
which
are
sown
in
the
young
intelligences
of
their
unfortunate
slaves
and
you
will
have
the
key
to
that
sad
mystery
what
is
not
only
the
first
but
the
daily
school
lesson
taught
to
the
roman
catholic
is
it
not
that
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
which
a
man
can
commit
is
to
follow
his
private
judgment
which
means
that
he
has
eyes
but
can
not
see
ears
but
he
can
not
hear
and
intelligence
but
he
can
not
make
use
of
it
in
the
research
of
truth
and
light
and
knowledge
without
danger
of
being
eternally
damned
his
mean
the
priest
and
the
see
for
him
hear
for
him
and
think
for
him
yes
the
roman
catholic
is
constantly
told
in
his
school
that
the
most
unpardonable
and
damnable
crime
is
to
make
use
of
his
own
intelligence
and
follow
own
private
in
the
research
of
truth
he
is
constantly
reminded
that
man
s
own
private
judgment
is
his
greatest
enemy
hence
all
his
intellectual
and
conscientious
efforts
must
be
brought
to
fight
down
silence
kill
his
private
it
is
by
the
judgment
of
his
priest
the
bishop
and
the
he
must
be
guided
in
everything
now
what
is
a
man
who
can
not
make
use
of
his
private
personal
judgment
is
he
not
a
slave
an
idiot
an
ass
and
what
is
a
nation
composed
of
men
who
do
not
make
use
of
their
private
personal
judgment
in
the
research
of
truth
and
happiness
if
not
a
nation
of
brutes
slaves
and
contemptible
idiots
but
as
this
will
look
like
an
exaggeration
on
my
part
allow
me
to
force
the
church
of
rome
to
come
here
and
speak
for
herself
please
pay
attention
to
what
she
has
to
say
about
the
intellectual
faculties
of
men
here
are
the
very
words
of
the
saint
ignatius
loyola
the
founder
of
the
jesuit
society
as
for
holy
obedience
this
virtue
must
be
perfect
in
every
execution
in
will
in
intellect
doing
which
is
enjoined
with
all
celerity
spiritual
joy
and
perseverance
persuading
ourselves
that
everything
is
just
suppressing
every
repugnant
thought
and
judgment
of
one
s
own
in
a
certain
obedience
and
let
every
one
persuade
himself
that
he
who
lives
under
obedience
should
be
moved
and
directed
under
divine
providence
by
his
superior
just
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
acsi
cadaver
which
allows
itself
to
be
moved
and
led
in
every
yes
protestants
when
you
send
your
child
to
school
it
is
that
he
may
more
and
more
understand
the
dignity
of
man
your
object
is
to
enlighten
expand
and
raise
his
intelligence
you
want
to
give
more
light
more
strength
more
food
more
life
to
that
intelligence
but
know
it
well
not
from
my
pen
but
from
the
solemn
declaration
of
rome
the
young
roman
catholic
goes
to
school
not
only
that
his
intelligence
may
be
fettered
clouded
and
paralyzed
but
that
it
may
be
killed
you
have
read
it
it
is
only
when
he
will
be
like
a
before
his
that
the
young
roman
catholic
will
have
attained
to
the
highest
degree
of
perfect
manhood
is
not
such
a
doctrine
absolutely
and
is
it
not
diabolical
would
not
mankind
become
a
flock
of
brute
beasts
if
the
church
of
rome
could
succeed
in
persuading
her
hundred
of
millions
of
slaves
to
consider
themselves
as
in
the
presence
of
their
superiors
some
one
will
perhaps
ask
me
what
can
be
the
object
of
the
popes
and
the
priests
of
rome
in
degrading
the
roman
catholics
in
such
a
strange
way
that
they
turn
them
into
moral
corpses
what
can
be
the
use
of
those
hundred
of
millions
of
corpses
why
not
let
them
live
the
answer
is
a
very
easy
one
the
great
and
the
only
object
of
the
thoughts
and
workings
of
the
pope
and
the
priests
is
to
raise
themselves
above
the
rest
of
the
world
they
want
to
be
high
high
high
above
the
head
not
only
of
the
common
people
but
of
the
kings
and
emperors
of
the
world
they
want
to
be
not
only
as
high
but
higher
than
god
it
is
when
speaking
of
the
pope
that
the
holy
ghost
says
he
opposeth
and
exalteth
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
or
that
is
worshipped
so
that
he
as
god
sitteth
in
the
temple
of
god
shewing
himself
that
he
is
god
thess
ii
to
attain
their
object
the
priests
have
persuaded
their
millions
and
millions
of
slaves
that
they
were
mere
corpses
that
they
must
have
no
will
no
conscience
no
intelligence
of
their
own
just
as
corpses
which
allow
themselves
to
be
moved
and
led
in
any
way
without
any
when
this
has
been
once
gained
they
have
made
a
pyramid
of
all
those
motionless
inert
corpses
which
is
so
high
that
though
its
feet
are
on
the
earth
its
top
goes
to
the
skies
in
the
very
abode
of
the
old
divinities
of
the
pagan
world
and
putting
themselves
and
their
popes
at
the
top
of
that
marvelous
pyramid
the
priests
say
to
the
rest
of
the
world
who
among
you
are
as
high
as
we
are
who
has
ever
been
raised
by
god
as
a
priest
and
a
pope
where
are
the
kings
and
the
emperors
whose
thrones
are
as
elevated
as
ours
are
we
not
at
the
very
top
of
humanity
yes
yes
i
answer
to
the
priests
of
rome
you
are
high
very
high
indeed
no
throne
on
earth
has
ever
been
so
sublime
so
exalted
as
yours
since
the
days
of
the
tower
of
babel
the
world
has
not
seen
such
a
high
fabric
your
throne
is
higher
than
anything
we
know
but
it
is
a
throne
of
corpses
and
if
you
want
to
know
what
other
use
is
made
of
those
millions
and
millions
of
corpses
i
will
tell
it
to
you
there
is
no
manure
so
rich
as
dead
carcasses
those
millions
of
corpses
serve
to
manure
the
gardens
of
the
priests
the
bishops
and
the
popes
and
make
their
cabbages
grow
and
what
fine
cabbages
grow
in
the
pope
s
garden
is
it
not
a
lucky
thing
for
the
world
in
general
and
for
the
roman
catholics
in
particular
that
though
they
are
taught
to
become
like
corpses
to
have
no
will
no
understanding
no
judgment
of
their
own
in
the
presence
of
their
superiors
there
are
many
who
can
never
attain
to
that
perfection
of
intellectual
degradation
and
death
yes
in
spite
of
the
efforts
in
spite
of
the
teachings
of
their
church
a
few
roman
catholics
retain
some
life
some
will
some
intelligence
some
judgment
of
their
own
which
prevents
them
from
becoming
complete
brutes
many
now
and
then
refuse
to
descend
to
the
damp
dark
and
putrid
abode
of
the
corpses
they
want
to
breathe
the
fresh
and
pure
air
of
liberty
which
god
has
given
to
man
they
raise
their
humiliated
forehead
from
the
ignominious
tomb
which
their
church
has
dug
for
them
and
they
give
some
signs
of
life
but
at
every
such
signs
of
life
given
by
an
individual
or
by
a
people
in
the
church
of
rome
be
sure
that
you
will
see
the
flashing
light
and
hear
the
roaring
thunder
of
the
vatican
directed
against
the
rebel
who
dares
to
refuse
to
become
a
before
his
superiors
it
is
for
having
shown
such
signs
of
life
and
independence
of
mind
that
galileo
was
sent
to
gaol
and
threatened
to
be
cruelly
tortured
on
the
racks
of
the
inquisition
in
italy
three
hundred
years
ago
it
is
for
having
shown
those
symptoms
of
life
that
not
long
ago
the
honest
kenna
one
of
the
most
respected
roman
catholics
of
the
day
was
excommunicated
the
day
before
his
death
and
had
to
be
buried
as
a
dog
in
his
own
field
for
having
refused
to
take
away
his
children
from
an
excellent
grammar
school
to
obey
the
priest
it
is
for
having
dared
to
think
for
himself
that
a
few
days
before
his
death
the
amiable
and
learned
montalembert
was
considered
as
an
outcast
by
the
pope
who
refused
him
the
honor
of
public
prayers
in
rome
after
his
death
but
that
you
may
better
understand
the
degrading
tendencies
of
the
principles
which
are
as
the
fundamental
stone
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
education
of
rome
let
me
put
before
your
eyes
another
extract
of
the
jesuit
teachings
which
i
take
again
from
the
spiritual
exercises
as
laid
down
by
their
founder
ignatius
loyola
that
we
may
in
all
things
attain
the
truth
that
we
may
not
err
in
anything
we
ought
ever
to
hold
as
a
fixed
principle
that
what
i
see
white
i
believe
to
be
black
if
the
superior
authorities
of
the
church
define
it
to
be
you
all
know
that
it
is
the
avowed
desire
of
rome
to
have
public
education
in
the
hands
of
the
jesuits
she
says
everywhere
that
they
are
the
best
the
model
teachers
why
so
because
they
more
boldly
and
more
successfully
than
any
other
of
her
teachers
aim
at
the
destruction
of
the
intelligence
and
conscience
of
their
pupils
rome
proclaims
everywhere
that
the
jesuits
are
the
most
devoted
the
most
reliable
of
her
teachers
and
she
is
right
for
when
a
man
has
been
trained
a
sufficient
time
by
them
he
most
perfectly
becomes
a
moral
corpse
his
superiors
can
do
what
they
please
with
him
when
he
knows
that
a
thing
is
white
as
snow
he
is
ready
to
swear
that
it
is
black
as
ink
if
his
superior
tells
him
so
but
some
may
be
tempted
to
think
that
these
degrading
principles
are
exclusively
taught
by
the
jesuits
that
they
are
not
the
teachings
of
the
church
and
that
i
do
an
injustice
to
the
roman
catholics
when
i
give
as
a
general
iniquity
what
is
the
guilt
of
the
jesuits
only
listen
to
the
words
of
that
infallible
pope
gregory
in
his
celebrated
encyclical
of
the
of
august
if
the
holy
church
so
requires
let
us
sacrifice
our
own
opinions
our
knowledge
the
splendid
dreams
of
our
imagination
and
the
most
sublime
attainments
of
the
human
it
is
when
considering
those
principles
of
rome
that
our
learned
and
profound
thinker
gladstone
wrote
not
long
ago
no
more
cunning
plot
was
ever
devised
against
the
freedom
the
happiness
and
the
virtues
of
mankind
than
letter
to
earl
now
protestants
do
you
begin
to
see
the
difference
of
the
object
of
education
between
a
protestant
and
a
roman
catholic
school
do
you
begin
to
understand
that
there
is
as
great
a
distance
between
the
word
education
among
you
and
the
meaning
of
the
same
word
in
the
church
of
rome
than
between
the
southern
and
the
northern
poles
by
education
you
mean
to
raise
man
to
the
highest
sphere
of
manhood
rome
means
to
lower
him
below
the
most
stupid
brutes
by
education
you
mean
to
teach
man
that
he
is
a
free
agent
that
liberty
within
the
limits
of
the
laws
of
god
and
of
his
country
is
a
gift
secured
to
every
one
you
want
to
impress
man
with
the
noble
thought
that
it
is
better
to
die
a
free
man
than
to
live
a
slave
rome
wants
to
teach
that
there
is
only
one
man
who
is
free
the
pope
and
that
all
the
rest
are
born
to
be
his
abject
slaves
in
thought
will
and
action
now
that
you
may
still
more
understand
to
what
a
bottomless
abyss
of
human
degradation
and
moral
depravity
these
and
principles
of
rome
lead
her
poor
blind
slaves
read
what
liguori
says
in
his
book
the
nun
sanctified
the
principal
and
most
efficacious
means
of
practicing
obedience
due
to
superiors
and
of
rendering
it
meritorious
before
god
is
to
consider
that
in
obeying
them
we
obey
god
himself
and
that
by
despising
their
commands
we
despise
the
authority
of
our
divine
master
when
thus
a
religious
receives
a
precept
from
her
prelate
superior
or
confessor
she
should
immediately
execute
it
only
to
please
but
principally
to
please
god
whose
will
is
made
known
to
her
by
their
command
in
obeying
their
command
in
obeying
their
directions
she
is
more
certainly
obeying
the
will
of
god
than
if
an
angel
came
down
from
heaven
to
manifest
his
will
to
her
bear
this
always
in
your
mind
that
the
obedience
which
you
practice
to
your
superior
is
paid
to
god
if
then
you
receive
a
command
from
one
who
holds
the
place
of
god
you
should
observe
it
with
the
same
diligence
as
if
it
came
from
god
himself
blessed
egidus
used
to
say
that
it
is
more
meritorious
to
obey
man
for
the
love
of
god
than
god
himself
it
may
be
added
that
there
is
more
certainty
of
doing
the
will
of
god
by
obedience
to
your
superior
than
by
obedience
to
jesus
christ
should
he
appear
in
person
and
give
his
commands
philip
de
neri
used
to
say
that
religious
shall
be
most
certain
of
not
having
to
render
an
account
of
the
actions
performed
through
obedience
for
these
the
superiors
only
who
commanded
them
shall
be
held
the
lord
said
once
to
catherine
of
sienne
religious
will
not
be
obliged
to
render
an
account
to
of
what
they
do
through
obedience
for
that
i
will
demand
an
account
from
the
superior
this
doctrine
is
conformable
to
sacred
scripture
behold
says
the
lord
as
clay
is
in
the
potter
s
hands
so
are
you
in
my
hand
o
israel
jeremiah
xviii
a
religious
man
must
be
in
the
hands
of
the
superiors
to
be
molded
as
they
will
shall
the
clay
say
to
him
that
fashioneth
it
what
art
thou
making
the
potter
ought
to
answer
be
silent
it
is
not
your
business
to
inquire
what
i
do
but
to
obey
and
to
receive
whatever
form
i
please
to
give
i
ask
of
you
american
protestants
what
would
become
of
your
fair
country
if
you
were
blind
enough
to
allow
the
church
of
rome
to
teach
the
children
of
the
united
states
what
kind
of
men
and
women
can
come
out
of
such
schools
what
future
of
shame
degradation
and
slavery
you
prepare
for
your
country
if
rome
does
succeed
in
forcing
you
to
support
such
schools
what
kind
of
women
would
come
out
from
the
schools
of
nuns
who
would
teach
them
that
the
highest
pitch
of
perfection
in
a
woman
is
when
she
obeys
her
superior
the
priest
everything
he
her
that
your
daughter
will
never
be
called
to
give
an
account
to
god
for
the
actions
she
will
have
done
to
please
and
obey
her
superior
the
priest
the
bishop
or
the
pope
that
the
affairs
of
her
conscience
will
be
arranged
between
god
and
that
superior
and
that
she
will
never
be
asked
why
she
had
done
this
or
that
when
it
will
be
to
gratify
the
pleasures
of
the
superior
and
obey
his
command
that
she
has
done
it
again
what
kind
of
men
and
citizens
will
come
out
from
the
schools
of
those
jesuits
who
believe
and
teach
that
a
man
has
attained
the
perfection
of
manhood
only
when
he
is
a
perfectly
spiritual
corpse
before
his
superior
when
he
obeys
the
priest
with
the
perfection
of
a
that
has
neither
life
nor
will
in
itself
but
some
will
be
tempted
to
think
that
this
perfect
blind
obedience
to
the
priest
which
is
the
of
the
roman
catholic
education
is
required
only
in
spiritual
matters
yes
but
you
must
not
forget
that
in
the
church
of
rome
every
action
of
the
public
or
private
life
belongs
to
the
spiritual
sphere
which
the
superior
only
must
rule
for
instance
a
roman
catholic
has
not
the
right
to
select
the
teacher
of
his
boy
nor
the
school
where
he
will
send
him
he
must
consult
his
priest
and
if
he
dares
to
act
in
a
different
way
from
what
his
priest
has
told
him
in
the
selection
of
that
teacher
or
that
school
he
is
excommunicated
and
damned
as
kenna
has
been
lately
if
he
votes
according
to
his
own
private
judgment
for
jones
instead
of
thompson
the
selected
member
of
the
bishop
and
the
priest
he
is
damned
and
considered
as
a
rebel
against
his
holy
church
out
of
which
there
is
no
salvation
the
church
of
rome
s
only
object
in
giving
what
she
calls
education
is
to
teach
her
slaves
that
they
must
obey
their
superiors
in
everything
as
god
himself
all
the
rest
of
her
teaching
is
only
a
mask
to
conceal
her
plans
history
is
never
taught
in
her
schools
what
she
calls
history
is
a
most
shameful
string
of
falsehoods
of
course
she
does
not
dare
to
say
a
word
of
truth
about
her
past
struggles
against
the
great
principles
of
light
and
liberty
when
she
covered
the
whole
of
europe
with
tears
blood
and
ruins
writing
reading
arithmetic
geography
and
grammar
are
taught
to
a
certain
degree
in
her
schools
but
all
these
teachings
are
nothing
else
but
covered
roads
through
which
the
priest
wants
to
reach
the
citadel
of
the
heart
and
intelligence
of
his
poor
victim
and
take
an
absolute
possession
of
them
those
things
are
taught
every
day
only
to
have
a
daily
opportunity
to
persuade
the
pupil
that
he
must
never
make
any
use
of
his
private
judgment
in
anything
and
that
he
must
submit
his
intelligence
his
conscience
his
will
to
the
intelligence
conscience
and
will
of
his
superior
if
he
wants
to
save
himself
from
the
eternal
fire
of
hell
he
is
constantly
told
what
i
have
been
told
a
thousand
times
myself
when
studying
in
the
college
of
nicolet
that
those
who
obey
their
superiors
in
everything
will
not
be
called
to
give
an
account
of
their
actions
to
their
supreme
judge
even
if
those
actions
were
bad
in
themselves
for
as
liguori
told
you
a
moment
ago
whosoever
obeys
his
superior
for
the
love
of
god
obeys
god
himself
and
that
there
are
more
merits
to
obey
one
s
own
superior
than
god
the
church
of
rome
shows
her
great
wisdom
in
enforcing
that
dogma
of
the
entire
and
blind
subjection
of
the
will
and
intelligence
of
the
inferior
to
the
superior
for
the
very
moment
that
a
roman
catholic
thinks
that
it
is
his
right
and
sacred
duty
to
follow
the
dictates
of
his
own
conscience
and
intelligence
he
is
lost
to
the
church
of
rome
it
is
only
when
a
man
has
entirely
silenced
and
absolutely
killed
his
intelligence
it
is
only
when
he
has
become
a
perfect
moral
corpse
that
he
can
believe
that
his
priest
even
his
drunken
priest
has
the
power
to
change
a
wafer
or
any
other
piece
of
bread
into
the
great
god
for
whom
and
by
whom
everything
has
been
created
it
is
only
when
the
intelligence
of
man
has
become
a
dead
carcass
that
he
can
believe
that
a
miserable
sinner
has
the
supreme
power
to
force
the
son
of
god
to
come
in
his
divine
and
human
person
into
his
vest
or
pant
s
pockets
to
follow
him
everywhere
he
wants
to
go
even
to
the
bar
of
the
low
tavern
that
he
may
become
his
companion
of
debauch
and
drunkenness
do
you
see
now
why
the
church
of
rome
can
not
let
her
poor
young
slaves
go
to
your
schools
in
your
schools
the
first
thing
you
inculcate
to
the
pupil
is
that
his
intelligence
is
the
great
gift
of
god
by
which
man
is
distinguished
from
the
brute
that
he
must
enlighten
form
feed
cultivate
his
intelligence
which
is
to
him
what
the
helm
is
to
the
ship
christ
with
his
holy
word
being
the
pilot
you
see
now
why
the
church
of
rome
abhors
your
schools
it
is
because
you
want
to
make
and
she
wants
to
make
you
want
to
raise
men
to
the
highest
sphere
to
which
his
intelligence
can
allow
him
to
reach
she
wants
to
keep
him
in
the
dust
at
the
feet
of
the
priests
you
want
to
form
free
citizens
she
wants
to
form
abject
and
obedient
slaves
of
the
priests
you
teach
man
to
keep
his
sacred
promises
and
stand
by
his
oath
she
teaches
him
that
the
pope
has
the
right
to
dissolve
the
most
sacred
promises
and
to
annul
all
his
oaths
even
to
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
his
country
you
tell
your
pupils
that
so
long
as
they
will
keep
themselves
within
the
limits
of
the
laws
of
their
country
they
are
responsible
only
to
god
for
their
consciences
they
tell
their
pupils
that
it
is
not
to
god
but
to
the
priest
that
he
must
go
to
give
an
account
of
his
conscience
you
teach
your
pupils
that
the
laws
of
god
only
bind
the
conscience
of
man
they
tell
him
that
it
is
the
laws
of
the
church
which
means
the
of
the
pope
which
binds
their
consciences
you
teach
the
student
that
every
man
has
the
right
to
change
his
religion
according
to
his
conscience
she
positively
says
that
no
man
has
the
right
to
change
his
religion
according
to
his
conscience
it
is
evident
that
the
church
of
rome
would
be
dead
if
she
would
allow
her
children
to
attend
schools
where
they
would
learn
to
follow
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
and
listen
to
the
voice
of
their
intelligence
but
she
is
too
shrewd
to
avow
before
the
world
the
real
reasons
why
she
wants
at
any
cost
to
prevent
her
children
from
attending
your
schools
and
it
is
here
she
shows
her
profound
and
diabolical
cunning
though
she
is
the
most
deadly
enemy
of
liberty
of
conscience
though
she
has
time
after
time
anathemized
liberty
of
conscience
as
one
of
satan
s
schemes
she
suddenly
steps
on
as
the
great
friend
and
apostle
of
liberty
of
conscience
and
under
that
new
mask
she
approaches
your
legislators
with
great
airs
of
dignity
and
says
we
are
happy
to
live
in
a
country
where
liberty
of
conscience
is
secured
to
every
citizen
it
is
in
its
sacred
name
that
we
respectfully
approach
your
honorable
legislature
to
ask
first
to
be
exempted
from
sending
our
children
to
the
government
schools
second
to
have
the
money
we
want
from
the
public
treasury
in
order
to
support
our
own
schools
for
two
reasons
first
you
read
the
bible
in
your
schools
and
it
is
against
our
conscience
to
let
our
children
read
the
bible
second
you
have
some
prayers
at
the
beginning
and
some
religious
hymns
sung
at
the
end
of
the
hours
of
school
and
it
is
against
our
conscience
to
allow
the
children
of
the
church
of
rome
to
join
you
in
those
prayers
and
the
legislators
who
for
the
greater
part
are
too
honorable
men
to
suspect
the
fraud
are
won
by
the
air
of
candor
and
honesty
of
the
roman
catholic
petitioners
considering
the
great
benefit
which
will
come
to
the
country
if
all
the
children
are
taught
in
the
same
school
they
are
soon
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
in
order
to
have
the
roman
catholic
and
the
protestant
children
under
the
same
roof
to
receive
the
same
light
and
the
same
moral
food
and
same
instruction
as
true
patriots
the
legislators
understand
that
if
they
wish
their
beloved
country
to
be
strong
and
happy
the
first
thing
they
must
do
is
to
make
the
young
generation
one
in
mind
in
heart
if
the
protestant
and
roman
catholic
children
are
taught
in
the
same
school
they
will
know
each
other
and
love
each
other
when
young
and
those
sacred
ties
of
friendship
which
will
bind
them
in
the
spring
of
life
will
be
strengthened
when
their
reason
will
be
matured
and
enlightened
by
a
good
education
under
the
same
respected
and
worthy
teachers
as
christian
men
the
legislators
would
perhaps
like
to
keep
the
bible
and
have
short
prayers
in
the
schools
but
as
patriots
they
feel
that
those
things
though
good
and
sacred
are
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
roman
catholic
the
delicate
conscience
of
the
bishops
and
priests
can
not
allow
such
things
in
the
school
attended
by
their
lambs
through
respect
for
the
sacred
rights
of
the
roman
catholic
conscience
the
legislators
in
many
places
throw
the
bible
overboard
and
they
say
to
god
please
get
out
from
our
schools
and
do
excuse
us
if
we
order
our
teachers
to
ignore
your
existence
they
say
to
jesus
christ
we
have
not
forgotten
your
sublime
and
touching
words
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
no
doubt
you
would
like
to
press
our
dear
little
ones
on
your
loving
heart
and
bless
them
for
a
moment
in
the
schools
but
we
can
not
allow
them
to
go
so
near
you
in
the
school
we
can
not
even
allow
them
to
speak
to
you
a
single
word
there
please
be
not
offended
if
we
turn
you
out
from
those
very
schools
where
you
were
so
welcome
formerly
we
are
forced
to
that
sad
extremity
through
the
respect
we
owe
to
the
tender
consciences
of
our
of
the
church
of
rome
you
know
that
they
can
not
allow
their
children
to
speak
to
you
together
with
but
when
those
awful
not
to
say
sacrilegious
sacrifices
have
been
made
by
the
protestant
legislators
to
appease
the
implacable
god
of
through
respect
for
the
scruples
of
the
bishops
and
priests
of
rome
the
great
god
of
heaven
with
his
son
jesus
christ
have
been
unceremoniously
turned
out
from
the
the
word
of
god
has
been
prohibited
and
the
bible
is
thrown
overboard
is
the
moloch
god
appeased
will
the
roman
catholic
bishops
and
priests
tell
their
children
that
they
may
unite
with
yours
to
go
and
receive
education
from
the
same
teacher
no
but
assuming
then
a
sublime
air
of
indignation
they
turn
against
you
as
mad
dogs
they
call
your
schools
good
only
to
form
thieves
infidels
and
atheists
do
you
see
now
that
all
those
dignified
scruples
of
conscience
about
reading
the
bible
praying
with
you
were
only
a
mask
to
deceive
you
and
make
you
fall
into
a
snare
do
you
not
perceive
now
that
they
did
not
care
a
straw
for
the
bible
and
the
prayers
in
the
schools
but
they
wanted
your
legislators
to
compromise
themselves
before
the
christian
world
lose
their
moral
strength
in
the
eyes
of
a
great
part
of
the
nation
divide
your
ranks
your
means
your
strength
and
beat
you
on
that
great
question
of
education
they
will
take
such
airs
of
martyrs
when
you
will
try
to
force
their
children
to
your
schools
that
many
honest
and
unsuspecting
protestants
will
be
completely
deceived
by
them
at
first
they
could
not
they
said
trust
the
children
to
your
hands
because
you
read
the
word
of
god
you
prayed
and
blessed
god
in
the
school
but
now
that
the
bible
and
god
are
turned
out
from
the
schools
they
baptize
them
by
the
most
ignominious
names
which
can
be
call
them
godless
schools
have
you
ever
seen
a
more
profoundly
ignominious
and
sacrilegious
trick
will
not
your
legislators
open
their
eyes
to
that
strange
act
of
deception
of
which
they
are
the
victims
will
they
not
come
out
quickly
from
the
traps
laid
before
them
by
the
bishops
and
the
priests
of
rome
yes
let
us
hope
that
your
patriots
and
christian
legislators
will
soon
understand
that
they
owe
a
reparation
to
god
and
to
their
country
with
unanimous
voice
they
will
ask
pardon
from
god
for
having
expelled
him
from
the
very
place
where
he
has
most
right
to
reign
school
for
what
is
a
school
without
god
in
its
midst
to
sit
as
a
father
and
to
form
the
young
hearts
and
evoke
the
young
intellect
what
is
a
boy
what
is
a
girl
what
is
a
woman
or
a
man
without
god
what
is
a
family
what
is
a
people
without
god
it
is
a
monstrosity
it
is
a
body
without
life
it
is
a
world
without
light
it
is
a
cistern
without
water
let
us
hope
that
before
long
your
patriotic
and
christian
legislators
will
remember
that
the
bible
is
the
foundation
of
the
greatness
of
protestant
nations
it
is
to
the
bible
the
united
states
as
well
as
great
britain
owe
their
liberty
power
prestige
and
strength
it
is
the
bible
that
has
ennobled
the
hearts
of
your
heroes
improved
the
minds
of
your
poets
and
orators
and
strengthened
the
arms
of
your
warriors
yes
it
is
because
your
soldiers
have
brought
with
them
everywhere
the
bible
pressed
on
their
hearts
that
they
have
conquered
the
enemies
of
liberty
so
long
as
the
united
states
will
be
true
to
the
bible
their
glorious
banners
will
fly
respected
and
feared
all
over
the
seas
and
over
all
the
continents
of
the
world
let
the
disciples
of
the
gospel
the
children
of
god
and
the
redeemed
of
christ
all
over
the
fair
and
noble
country
you
inhabit
hasten
to
request
their
legislators
to
invite
the
saviour
of
the
world
to
come
back
and
bless
their
dear
children
in
the
school
for
it
is
not
only
in
your
homes
and
in
your
churches
that
jesus
tells
you
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
it
is
particularly
in
the
school
oh
give
two
or
three
minutes
to
those
dear
little
ones
that
they
may
press
themselves
on
his
bosom
bless
him
for
having
saved
them
on
the
cross
and
proclaim
his
mercies
by
singing
one
of
those
hymns
which
they
like
so
much
by
this
noble
act
of
national
reparation
you
will
take
away
from
the
hands
of
the
priests
the
only
weapon
with
which
they
can
hurt
you
you
will
destroy
the
only
argument
they
use
with
a
true
force
against
your
schools
when
they
call
them
godless
schools
do
not
fear
any
more
the
priests
and
the
prelates
of
rome
do
not
yield
any
more
and
give
up
your
privilege
to
please
them
and
reconcile
them
to
your
schools
you
will
never
be
able
to
reconcile
them
to
your
schools
for
there
is
light
in
your
schools
and
they
want
the
darkness
there
is
freedom
and
liberty
in
your
schools
they
want
slavery
there
is
life
in
your
schools
and
it
is
only
on
dead
corpses
that
their
church
can
have
a
chance
to
live
a
few
years
more
you
see
by
a
sad
experience
that
their
scruples
of
conscience
against
the
bible
and
the
prayer
of
the
school
are
mere
hypocrisy
just
thrown
into
the
eyes
of
the
public
do
not
say
with
some
honest
but
deluded
protestants
is
it
not
enough
that
that
child
should
learn
his
religion
at
home
no
it
is
not
enough
for
it
is
in
our
nature
that
we
want
two
witnesses
to
believe
a
thing
what
comes
to
our
mind
only
through
one
witness
remains
uncertain
but
let
two
good
witnesses
confirm
a
fact
and
then
we
accept
it
your
child
wants
two
witnesses
to
believe
the
necessity
of
the
sacredness
of
religion
his
christian
home
is
surely
a
good
witness
to
your
child
but
it
is
not
enough
what
he
has
heard
from
you
must
be
confirmed
by
his
school
teacher
without
this
second
witness
nine
times
out
of
ten
your
children
will
be
skeptics
and
infidels
besides
that
the
very
idea
of
god
brings
with
it
the
obligation
to
bless
love
and
adore
him
everywhere
the
moment
you
take
your
child
to
a
place
where
not
only
he
can
not
love
bless
and
adore
god
but
where
the
adoration
and
the
praise
of
god
are
forbidden
you
entirely
destroy
the
idea
of
god
from
the
mind
and
from
the
heart
of
your
child
you
make
him
believe
that
what
you
have
told
him
when
at
home
of
god
is
only
a
fable
to
amuse
and
deceive
him
do
you
see
that
noble
ship
in
the
midst
of
that
splendid
harbor
how
she
is
tossed
by
the
foaming
waves
how
she
is
beaten
by
the
furious
winds
what
does
prevent
that
ship
from
flying
before
the
storm
and
running
ashore
a
miserable
wreck
what
does
prevent
her
from
being
dashed
on
that
rock
the
anchor
yes
the
anchor
is
her
safety
but
let
a
single
link
of
the
chain
that
binds
the
ship
to
her
anchor
break
will
she
not
soon
be
dashed
on
the
rock
and
broken
to
pieces
and
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
it
is
so
with
your
child
so
long
as
his
intelligence
and
his
heart
are
united
to
god
by
the
anchor
of
faith
he
will
nobly
stand
against
the
furious
waves
he
will
nobly
fight
his
battles
but
let
the
school
teacher
be
silent
about
god
and
here
is
a
broken
link
and
the
child
will
be
a
wreck
do
not
fear
the
priest
but
fear
god
do
not
try
any
more
to
please
the
priests
but
do
all
in
your
power
to
please
your
great
and
merciful
god
not
only
in
your
homes
but
also
in
your
schools
and
those
schools
will
become
more
than
ever
a
focus
of
light
an
inexhaustible
source
of
intellectual
and
moral
than
ever
your
children
will
learn
in
the
school
to
be
your
honor
and
your
glory
and
your
joy
they
will
learn
that
they
are
not
ignoble
worms
of
the
dust
whose
existence
will
end
in
the
tomb
but
that
they
are
immortal
as
god
whose
beloved
children
they
are
they
will
learn
how
to
serve
their
god
and
love
their
country
be
not
ashamed
but
be
proud
to
send
your
children
to
schools
where
they
will
learn
how
to
be
good
christians
and
good
citizens
when
you
will
have
finished
your
pilgrimage
they
will
be
your
worthy
successors
and
the
god
whom
they
will
have
learned
to
fear
serve
and
love
in
the
school

theology
of
the
church
of
rome
its
and
character
talleyrand
one
of
the
most
celebrated
roman
catholic
bishops
of
france
once
said
language
is
the
art
of
concealing
one
s
never
was
there
a
truer
expression
if
it
had
reference
to
the
awful
deceptions
practiced
by
the
church
of
rome
under
the
pompous
name
of
theological
theology
is
the
study
of
the
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
god
nothing
then
is
more
noble
than
the
study
of
theology
how
solemn
were
my
thoughts
and
elevated
my
aspirations
when
in
under
the
guidance
of
the
rev
raimbault
and
leprohon
i
commenced
my
theological
course
of
study
at
nicolet
which
i
was
to
end
in
i
supposed
that
my
books
of
theology
were
to
bring
me
nearer
to
my
god
by
the
more
perfect
knowledge
i
would
acquire
in
their
study
of
his
holy
will
and
his
sacred
laws
my
hope
was
that
they
would
be
to
my
heart
what
the
burning
coal
brought
by
the
angel
of
the
lord
was
to
the
lips
of
the
prophet
of
old
the
principal
theologians
which
we
had
in
our
hands
were
les
conferences
d
anger
bailly
dens
thomas
but
above
all
liguori
who
has
since
been
canonized
never
did
i
open
one
without
offering
up
a
fervent
prayer
to
god
and
to
the
virgin
mary
for
the
light
and
grace
of
which
i
would
be
in
need
for
myself
and
for
the
people
whose
pastor
i
was
to
become
but
how
shall
i
relate
my
surprise
when
i
discovered
that
in
order
to
accept
the
principles
of
the
theologians
which
my
church
gave
me
for
guides
i
had
to
put
away
all
principles
of
truth
of
justice
of
honor
and
holiness
what
long
and
painful
efforts
it
cost
me
to
extinguish
one
by
one
the
lights
of
truth
and
of
reason
kindled
by
the
hand
of
my
merciful
god
in
my
intelligence
for
to
study
theology
in
the
church
of
rome
signifies
to
learn
to
speak
falsely
to
deceive
to
commit
robbery
to
perjure
one
s
self
it
means
how
to
commit
sins
without
shame
it
means
to
plunge
the
soul
into
every
kind
of
iniquity
and
turpitude
without
remorse
i
know
that
roman
catholics
will

are
assured
by
the
theologians
of
the
church
of
rome
that
they
can
lie
steal
murder
and
perjure
themselves
as
much
as
they
like
without
offending
god
provided
they
commit
those
crimes
according
to
certain
rules
approved
by
the
pope
for
the
good
of
the
church
i
should
have
to
write
several
large
volumes
were
i
to
quote
all
the
roman
catholic
doctors
and
theologians
who
approve
of
lying
of
perjury
of
adultery
theft
and
murder
for
the
greatest
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
the
roman
church
but
i
have
quoted
enough
for
those
who
have
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
with
such
principles
is
it
a
wonder
that
all
the
roman
catholic
nations
without
a
single
exception
have
declined
so
rapidly
the
great
legislator
of
the
world
the
only
saviour
of
nations
has
said
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
nation
can
be
great
and
strong
only
according
to
the
truths
which
form
the
basis
of
her
faith
and
life
truth
is
the
only
bread
which
god
gives
to
the
nations
that
they
may
prosper
and
live
deceitfulness
duplicity
perjury
adultery
theft
murder
are
the
deadly
poisons
which
kill
the
nations
then
the
more
the
priests
of
rome
with
their
theology
are
venerated
and
believed
by
a
people
the
sooner
that
people
will
decay
and
fall
the
more
priests
the
more
crimes
has
said
a
profound
thinker
for
then
the
more
hands
will
be
at
work
to
pull
down
the
only
sure
foundations
of
society
how
can
any
man
be
sure
of
the
honesty
of
his
wife
as
long
as
a
hundred
thousand
priests
tell
her
that
she
may
commit
any
sin
with
her
neighbor
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
doing
something
worse
or
when
she
is
assured
that
though
guilty
of
adultery
she
can
swear
she
is
pure
as
an
angel
what
will
it
avail
to
teach
the
best
principles
of
honor
decency
and
holiness
to
a
young
girl
when
she
is
bound
to
go
many
times
a
year
to
a
bachelor
priest
who
is
bound
in
conscience
to
give
her
the
most
infamous
lessons
of
depravity
under
the
pretext
of
helping
her
to
confess
all
her
sins
how
will
the
rights
of
justice
be
secured
and
how
can
the
judges
and
the
juries
protect
the
innocent
and
punish
the
guilty
so
long
as
the
witnesses
are
told
by
two
hundred
thousand
priests
that
they
can
conceal
the
truth
give
equivocal
answers
and
even
perjure
themselves
under
a
thousand
pretexts
what
government
either
monarchical
or
republican
can
be
sure
of
a
lease
of
existence
how
can
they
make
their
people
walk
with
a
firm
step
in
the
ways
of
light
progress
and
liberty
as
long
as
there
is
a
dark
power
over
them
which
has
the
right
at
every
hour
of
the
day
or
night
to
break
and
dissolve
all
the
most
sacred
oaths
of
allegiance
armed
with
his
theology
the
priest
of
rome
has
become
the
most
dangerous
and
determined
enemy
of
truth
justice
and
liberty
he
is
the
most
formidable
obstacle
to
every
good
government
as
he
is
without
being
aware
of
it
the
greatest
enemy
of
god
and
man
chapter
xiv
the
vow
of
celibacy
were
i
to
write
all
the
ingenious
tricks
pious
lies
shameful
stories
called
miracles
and
sacrilegious
perversions
of
the
word
of
god
made
use
of
by
superiors
of
seminaries
and
nunneries
to
entice
their
poor
victims
into
the
trap
of
perpetual
celibacy
i
should
have
to
write
ten
large
volumes
instead
of
a
short
chapter
sometimes
the
trials
and
obligations
of
married
life
are
so
exaggerated
that
they
may
frighten
the
strongest
heart
at
other
times
the
joys
peace
and
privileges
of
celibacy
are
depicted
with
such
brilliant
colors
that
they
fill
the
coldest
mind
with
enthusiasm
the
pope
takes
his
victim
to
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
and
there
shows
him
all
the
honors
praise
wealth
peace
and
joys
of
this
world
united
to
the
most
glorious
throne
of
heaven
and
then
tells
him
i
will
give
you
all
those
things
if
you
fall
at
my
feet
promise
me
an
absolute
submission
and
swear
never
to
marry
in
order
to
serve
me
who
can
refuse
such
glorious
things
but
before
entirely
shutting
their
eyes
so
that
they
may
not
see
the
bottomless
abyss
into
which
they
are
to
fall
the
unfortunate
victims
sometimes
have
forebodings
and
presentiments
of
the
terrible
miseries
which
are
in
store
for
them
the
voice
of
their
conscience
intelligence
and
common
sense
has
not
always
been
so
fully
silenced
as
the
superior
desired
at
the
very
time
when
the
tempter
is
whispering
his
lying
promises
into
their
ears
their
heavenly
father
is
speaking
to
them
of
the
ceaseless
trials
the
shameful
falls
the
tedious
days
the
dreary
nights
and
the
cruel
and
insufferable
burdens
which
are
concealed
behind
the
walls
where
the
sweet
yoke
of
the
good
master
is
exchanged
for
the
burdens
of
heartless
men
and
women
as
formerly
the
human
victims
crowned
with
flowers
when
dragged
to
the
foot
of
the
altar
of
their
false
gods
often
cried
out
with
alarm
and
struggled
to
escape
from
the
bloody
knife
of
the
heathen
priest
so
at
the
approach
of
the
fatal
hour
at
which
the
impious
vow
is
to
be
made
the
young
victims
often
feel
their
hearts
fainting
and
filled
with
terror
with
pale
cheeks
trembling
lips
and
sweat
they
ask
their
superiors
is
it
possible
that
our
merciful
god
requires
of
us
such
a
sacrifice
oh
how
the
merciless
priest
of
rome
then
becomes
eloquent
in
depicting
celibacy
as
the
only
way
to
heaven
or
in
showing
the
eternal
fires
of
hell
ready
to
receive
cowards
and
traitors
who
after
having
put
their
hand
to
the
plough
of
celibacy
look
back
he
speaks
of
the
disappointment
and
sadness
of
so
many
dear
friends
who
expected
better
things
of
them
he
points
out
to
them
their
own
shame
when
they
will
again
be
in
a
world
which
will
have
nothing
for
them
but
sneers
for
their
want
of
perseverance
and
courage
he
overwhelms
them
with
a
thousand
pious
lies
about
the
miracles
wrought
by
christ
in
favor
of
his
virgins
and
priests
he
bewitches
them
by
numerous
texts
of
scripture
which
he
brings
as
evident
proof
of
the
will
of
god
in
favor
of
their
taking
the
vows
of
celibacy
though
they
have
not
the
slightest
reference
to
such
vows
the
text
of
which
the
strangest
abuses
are
made
by
the
superiors
to
persuade
the
young
people
of
both
sexes
to
bind
themselves
to
those
shameful
vows
is
matt
for
there
are
eunuchs
which
were
born
from
their
mother
s
womb
and
there
are
some
eunuchs
which
were
made
eunuchs
of
men
and
there
are
eunuchs
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
s
sake
he
that
is
able
to
receive
it
let
him
receive
upon
one
occasion
our
superior
made
a
very
pressing
appeal
to
our
religious
feelings
from
this
text
to
induce
us
to
make
the
vow
of
celibacy
and
become
priests
but
the
address
though
delivered
with
a
great
deal
of
zeal
seemed
to
us
deficient
in
logic
the
next
day
was
a
day
of
rest
the
students
in
theology
who
were
preparing
themselves
for
the
priesthood
with
me
talked
seriously
of
the
singular
arguments
of
the
last
address
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
conclusions
could
not
in
any
way
be
drawn
from
the
selected
text
and
therefore
determined
to
respectfully
present
their
objections
and
their
views
which
were
also
mine
to
the
superior
and
i
was
chosen
to
speak
for
them
all
at
the
next
conference
after
respectfully
asking
and
obtaining
permission
to
express
our
objections
with
our
own
frank
and
plain
sentiments
i
spoke
about
as
follows
dear
and
venerable
sir
you
told
us
that
the
following
words
of
christ
be
eunuchs
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
s
us
evidently
that
we
must
make
the
vow
of
celibacy
and
make
ourselves
eunuchs
if
we
want
to
become
priests
allow
us
to
tell
you
respectfully
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
mind
of
our
saviour
was
very
different
from
yours
when
he
pronounced
these
words
in
our
humble
opinion
the
only
object
of
the
son
of
god
was
to
warn
his
disciples
against
one
of
the
most
damnable
errors
which
were
to
endanger
the
very
existence
of
nations
he
was
foretelling
that
there
would
be
men
so
wicked
and
blind
as
to
preach
that
the
best
way
for
men
to
go
to
heaven
would
be
to
make
eunuchs
of
themselves
allow
us
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
that
speech
jesus
christ
neither
approves
nor
disapproves
of
the
idea
of
gaining
a
throne
in
heaven
by
becoming
eunuchs
he
leaves
us
to
our
common
sense
and
to
some
clearer
parts
of
scripture
to
see
whether
or
not
he
approves
of
those
who
would
make
eunuchs
of
themselves
to
gain
a
crown
in
heaven
must
we
not
interpret
this
text
as
we
interpret
what
jesus
said
to
his
apostles
the
time
cometh
that
whosoever
killeth
you
will
think
that
he
doeth
god
s
service
john
allow
us
to
put
these
two
texts
face
to
face
there
are
eunuchs
which
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
s
matt
the
time
cometh
that
whosoever
killeth
you
will
think
that
he
doeth
god
s
john
xvi
because
our
saviour
has
said
that
there
would
be
men
who
would
think
that
they
would
please
god
and
of
course
gain
a
place
in
heaven
by
killing
his
disciples
are
we
therefore
allowed
to
conclude
that
it
would
be
our
duty
to
kill
those
who
believe
and
follow
christ
surely
not
well
it
seems
to
us
that
we
are
not
to
believe
that
the
best
way
to
go
to
heaven
is
to
make
ourselves
eunuchs
because
our
saviour
had
said
that
some
men
had
got
that
criminal
and
foolish
notion
into
their
mind
christian
nations
have
always
looked
with
horror
upon
those
who
voluntarily
became
eunuchs
common
sense
as
well
as
the
word
of
god
condemns
those
who
thus
destroy
in
their
own
bodies
that
which
god
in
his
wisdom
gave
them
for
the
wisest
and
holiest
purposes
would
it
not
therefore
be
a
crime
which
every
civilized
and
christian
nation
would
punish
to
preach
publicly
and
with
success
to
the
people
that
one
of
the
surest
ways
for
a
man
to
go
to
heaven
would
be
to
make
himself
an
eunuch
how
can
we
believe
that
our
saviour
could
ever
sanction
such
a
practice
moreover
if
being
eunuchs
would
make
the
way
to
heaven
surer
and
more
easy
would
not
god
be
unjust
for
depriving
us
of
the
great
privilege
of
being
born
eunuchs
and
thus
being
made
ripe
fruits
for
heaven
it
seems
to
us
that
that
text
does
not
in
any
way
require
us
to
believe
that
an
eunuch
is
nearer
the
kingdom
of
god
than
he
who
lives
just
according
to
the
laws
which
god
gave
to
man
in
the
earthly
paradise
if
it
was
not
good
for
man
to
be
without
his
wife
when
he
was
so
holy
and
strong
as
he
was
in
the
garden
of
eden
how
can
it
be
good
now
that
he
is
so
weak
and
sinful
our
saviour
clearly
shows
that
he
finds
no
sanctifying
power
in
the
state
of
an
eunuch
in
his
answer
to
the
young
man
who
asked
him
good
master
what
must
i
do
that
i
may
have
eternal
life
matt
did
the
good
master
answer
him
in
the
language
we
heard
from
you
two
days
ago
namely
that
the
best
way
to
have
eternal
life
is
to
make
yourself
an
a
solemn
vow
never
to
marry
no
but
he
said
keep
the
commandments
were
the
blessed
saviour
in
your
place
and
i
should
ask
him
what
must
i
do
to
be
saved
and
to
show
the
way
of
god
to
my
brethren
would
he
not
say
to
me
keep
the
commandments
but
where
is
the
commandment
of
god
in
the
old
or
new
testament
to
induce
us
to
make
such
a
vow
as
that
of
celibacy
the
promise
of
a
place
in
heaven
is
not
attached
in
any
way
to
the
vow
of
celibacy
christ
has
not
a
word
about
that
doctrine
allow
us
to
respectfully
ask
if
the
views
concerning
the
vows
of
celibacy
entertained
by
christ
had
been
like
yours
is
it
possible
that
he
would
have
forgotten
to
mention
them
when
he
answered
the
solemn
question
of
that
young
man
is
it
possible
that
he
would
not
have
said
a
single
word
about
a
thing
which
you
have
represented
to
us
as
being
of
such
vital
importance
to
those
who
sincerely
desire
to
know
what
to
do
to
be
saved
is
it
not
strange
that
the
church
should
attach
such
an
importance
to
that
vow
of
celibacy
when
we
look
in
vain
for
such
an
ordinance
in
both
the
old
and
new
testaments
how
can
we
understand
the
reasons
or
the
importance
of
such
a
strict
and
we
dare
say
unnatural
obligation
in
our
day
when
we
know
very
well
that
the
holy
apostles
themselves
were
living
with
their
wives
and
that
the
saviour
had
not
a
word
of
rebuke
for
them
on
that
account
this
free
expression
of
our
common
views
on
the
vows
of
celibacy
evidently
took
our
superior
by
surprise
he
answered
me
with
an
accent
of
indignation
which
he
could
not
suppress
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
it
is
not
quite
all
we
have
to
say
i
answered
but
before
we
go
further
we
would
be
much
gratified
to
receive
from
you
the
light
we
want
on
the
difficulties
which
i
have
just
you
have
spoken
as
a
true
heretic
replied
leprohon
with
an
unusual
vivacity
and
were
it
not
for
the
hope
which
i
entertain
that
you
said
those
things
more
to
receive
the
light
you
want
than
to
present
and
support
the
heretical
side
of
such
an
important
question
i
would
at
once
denounce
you
to
the
bishop
you
speak
of
the
holy
scriptures
just
as
a
protestant
would
do
you
appeal
to
them
as
the
only
source
of
christian
truth
and
knowledge
have
you
forgotten
that
we
have
the
holy
traditions
to
guide
us
the
authority
of
which
is
equal
to
that
of
the
scriptures
you
are
correct
when
you
say
that
we
do
not
find
any
direct
proof
in
the
bible
to
enforce
the
vows
of
celibacy
upon
those
who
desire
to
consecrate
themselves
to
the
service
of
the
church
but
if
we
do
not
find
the
obligation
of
that
vow
in
the
bible
we
find
it
in
the
holy
traditions
of
the
church
it
is
an
article
of
faith
that
the
vow
of
celibacy
is
ordered
by
jesus
christ
through
his
church
the
ordinances
of
the
church
which
are
nothing
but
the
ordinances
of
the
son
of
god
are
clear
on
that
subject
and
bind
our
consciences
just
as
the
commandments
of
god
upon
mount
sinai
for
christ
has
said
those
who
do
not
hear
the
church
must
be
looked
upon
as
heathen
and
publicans
there
is
no
salvation
to
those
who
do
not
submit
their
reasoning
to
the
teachings
of
the
church
you
are
not
required
to
understand
all
the
reasons
for
the
vow
of
celibacy
but
you
are
bound
tobelieve
in
its
and
as
the
church
has
pronounced
her
verdict
upon
that
question
it
is
not
your
business
to
argue
about
those
matters
but
your
duty
is
to
obey
the
church
as
dutiful
children
obey
a
kind
mother
but
who
can
have
any
doubt
about
the
necessity
of
the
vows
of
celibacy
when
we
remember
that
christ
had
ordered
his
apostles
to
separate
themselves
from
their
wives
fact
on
which
no
doubt
can
remain
after
hearing
peter
say
to
our
saviour
behold
we
have
forsaken
all
and
followed
thee
what
shall
we
have
therefore
matt
xix
is
not
the
priest
the
true
representative
of
christ
on
earth
in
his
ordination
is
not
the
priest
made
the
equal
and
in
a
sense
the
superior
of
christ
for
when
he
celebrates
mass
he
commands
christ
and
that
very
son
of
god
is
bound
to
obey
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
christ
to
resist
the
orders
of
the
priest
he
must
come
down
from
heaven
every
time
the
priest
orders
him
the
priest
shuts
him
up
in
the
holy
tabernacles
or
takes
him
out
of
them
according
to
his
own
will
by
becoming
priests
of
the
new
testament
you
will
be
raised
to
a
dignity
which
is
much
above
that
of
angels
from
these
sublime
privileges
flows
the
obligation
of
the
priest
to
raise
himself
to
a
degree
of
holiness
much
above
the
level
of
the
common
people
a
holiness
equal
to
that
of
the
angels
has
not
our
saviour
when
speaking
of
the
angels
said
nubent
neque
nubentur
they
marry
not
nor
are
given
in
marriage
surely
since
the
priests
are
the
messengers
and
angels
of
god
on
earth
they
must
be
clad
with
angelic
holiness
and
purity
does
not
paul
say
that
the
state
of
virginity
is
superior
to
that
of
marriage
does
not
that
saying
of
the
apostle
show
that
the
priest
whose
hands
every
day
touch
the
divine
body
and
blood
of
christ
must
be
chaste
and
pure
and
must
not
be
defiled
by
the
duties
of
married
life
that
vow
of
celibacy
it
like
a
holy
chain
which
keeps
us
above
the
filth
of
this
earth
and
ties
us
to
heaven
jesus
christ
through
his
holy
church
commands
that
vow
to
his
priests
as
the
most
efficacious
remedy
against
the
inclinations
of
our
corrupt
nature
according
to
the
holy
fathers
the
vow
of
celibacy
is
like
a
strong
high
tower
from
the
top
of
which
we
can
fight
our
enemies
and
be
perfectly
safe
from
their
darts
and
weapons
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
your
other
objections
if
you
have
any
more
said
leprohon
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
answers
i
replied
and
we
will
avail
ourselves
of
your
kindness
to
present
you
with
some
other
observations
and
firstly
we
thank
you
for
having
told
us
that
we
find
nothing
in
the
word
of
god
to
support
the
vows
of
celibacy
and
that
it
is
only
by
the
traditions
of
the
church
that
we
can
prove
their
necessity
and
holiness
it
was
our
impression
that
you
desired
us
to
believe
that
the
necessity
of
that
vow
was
founded
on
the
holy
scriptures
if
you
will
allow
it
we
will
discuss
the
traditions
another
time
and
will
confine
ourselves
to
the
different
texts
to
which
you
referred
in
favor
of
celibacy
when
peter
says
we
have
given
up
everything
it
seems
to
us
that
he
had
no
intention
of
saying
that
he
had
forever
given
up
his
wife
by
a
vow
for
paul
positively
says
many
years
after
that
peter
had
his
wife
that
he
was
not
only
living
with
her
in
his
own
house
but
was
traveling
with
her
when
preaching
the
gospel
the
words
of
scripture
are
of
such
evidence
on
that
subject
that
they
can
neither
be
obscured
by
any
shrewd
explanation
nor
by
any
tradition
however
respectable
it
may
appear
though
you
know
the
words
of
paul
on
that
subject
you
will
allow
us
to
read
them
have
we
not
power
to
eat
and
drink
have
we
not
power
to
lead
about
a
sister
a
wife
as
well
as
other
apostles
and
as
the
brethren
of
the
lord
and
cephas
cor
peter
saying
we
have
forsaken
everything
could
not
mean
then
that
he
had
made
a
vow
of
celibacy
and
that
he
would
not
live
with
his
wife
as
a
married
man
evidently
the
words
of
peter
mean
only
that
jesus
had
the
first
place
in
his
everything
else
even
the
dearest
objects
of
his
love
as
father
mother
wife
were
only
secondary
in
his
affections
and
thoughts
your
other
text
about
the
angels
who
do
not
marry
from
which
you
infer
the
obligation
and
law
of
the
vow
of
celibacy
does
not
seem
to
us
to
bear
on
that
subject
as
much
as
you
have
told
us
for
be
kind
enough
to
again
read
the
text
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
them
ye
do
err
not
knowing
the
scriptures
nor
the
power
of
god
for
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
as
the
angels
of
god
in
heaven
matt
xxii
you
see
that
when
our
saviour
speaks
of
men
who
are
like
angels
and
who
do
not
marry
he
takes
care
to
observe
that
he
speaks
of
the
state
of
men
the
if
the
church
had
the
same
rule
for
us
that
christ
mentioned
for
the
angelic
men
to
whom
he
refers
and
would
allow
us
to
make
a
vow
never
to
marry
after
the
resurrection
we
would
not
have
the
slightest
objection
to
such
a
vow
you
see
that
our
saviour
speaks
of
a
state
of
celibacy
but
he
does
not
intimate
that
that
state
is
to
begin
on
this
side
of
the
grave
why
does
not
our
church
imitate
and
follow
the
teachings
of
our
saviour
why
does
she
enforce
a
state
of
celibacy
before
the
resurrection
while
christ
postpones
the
promulgation
of
this
law
till
after
that
great
day
christ
speaks
of
a
perpetual
celibacy
only
in
heaven
on
what
authority
then
does
our
church
enforce
that
celibacy
on
this
side
of
the
grave
when
we
still
carry
our
souls
in
earthly
vessels
you
tell
us
that
the
vow
of
celibacy
is
the
best
remedy
against
the
inclinations
of
our
corrupt
nature
but
do
you
not
fear
that
your
remedy
makes
war
against
the
great
one
which
god
prepared
in
his
wisdom
do
we
not
read
in
our
own
vulgate
propter
fornicationem
autem
quisque
suam
uxorem
habeat
et
unaquaquรฆ
virum
suum
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
husband
cor
vii
is
it
not
too
strange
indeed
that
god
does
tell
us
that
the
best
remedy
he
had
prepared
against
the
inclinations
of
our
corrupt
nature
is
in
the
blessings
of
a
holy
marriage
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
and
every
woman
her
own
but
now
our
church
has
found
another
remedy
which
is
more
accordant
to
the
dignity
of
man
and
the
holiness
of
god
and
that
remedy
is
the
vow
of
celibacy
the
sound
of
my
last
words
were
still
on
my
lips
when
our
venerable
superior
unable
any
longer
to
conceal
his
indignation
abruptly
interrupted
me
saying
i
do
exceedingly
regret
to
have
allowed
you
to
go
so
far
this
is
not
a
christian
and
humble
discussion
between
young
levites
and
their
superior
to
receive
from
him
the
light
they
want
it
is
the
exposition
and
defence
of
the
most
heretical
doctrines
i
have
ever
heard
are
you
not
ashamed
when
you
try
to
make
us
prefer
your
interpretation
of
the
holy
scriptures
to
that
of
the
church
is
it
to
you
or
to
his
holy
church
that
christ
promised
the
light
of
the
holy
ghost
is
it
you
who
have
to
teach
the
church
or
the
church
who
must
teach
you
is
it
you
who
will
govern
and
guide
the
church
or
the
church
who
will
govern
and
guide
you
my
dear
chiniquy
if
there
is
not
a
great
and
prompt
change
in
you
and
in
those
whom
you
pretend
to
represent
i
fear
much
for
you
all
you
show
a
spirit
of
infidelity
and
revolt
which
frightens
me
just
like
lucifer
you
rebel
against
the
lord
do
you
not
fear
to
share
the
eternal
pains
of
his
rebellion
whence
have
you
taken
the
false
and
heretical
notions
you
have
for
instance
about
the
wives
of
the
apostles
do
you
not
know
that
you
are
supporting
a
protestant
error
when
you
say
that
the
apostles
were
living
with
their
wives
in
the
usual
way
of
married
people
it
is
true
that
paul
says
that
the
apostles
had
women
with
them
and
that
they
were
even
traveling
with
them
but
the
holy
traditions
of
the
church
tell
us
that
those
women
were
holy
virgins
who
were
traveling
with
the
apostles
to
serve
and
help
them
in
different
ways
they
were
ministering
to
their
different
their
underclothes
preparing
their
meals
just
like
the
housekeeper
whom
the
priests
have
it
is
a
protestant
impiety
to
think
and
speak
otherwise
but
only
a
word
more
and
i
am
done
if
you
accept
the
teaching
of
the
church
and
submit
yourself
as
doubtful
children
to
that
most
holy
mother
she
will
raise
you
to
the
dignity
of
the
priesthood
a
dignity
much
above
kings
and
emperors
in
this
world
if
you
serve
her
with
fidelity
she
will
secure
to
you
the
respect
and
veneration
of
the
whole
world
while
you
live
and
procure
you
a
crown
of
glory
in
heaven
but
if
you
reject
her
doctrines
and
persist
in
your
rebellious
views
against
one
of
the
most
holy
dogmas
if
you
continue
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
your
own
deceitful
reason
rather
than
to
the
voice
of
the
church
in
the
interpretation
of
the
holy
scriptures
you
become
heretics
apostates
and
protestants
you
will
lead
a
dishonored
life
in
this
world
and
you
will
be
lost
for
all
our
superior
left
us
immediately
after
these
fulminating
words
some
of
the
theological
students
after
his
exit
laughed
heartily
and
thanked
me
for
having
so
bravely
fought
and
gained
a
glorious
victory
two
of
them
joseph
turcot
and
benony
legendre
disgusted
by
the
sophisms
and
logical
absurdities
of
our
superior
left
the
seminary
a
few
days
after
the
rest
with
me
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
follow
their
example
but
remained
stunned
by
the
last
words
of
our
superior
i
went
to
my
room
and
fell
on
my
knees
with
a
torrent
of
tears
falling
from
my
eyes
i
was
really
sorry
for
having
wounded
his
feelings
but
still
more
so
for
having
dared
for
a
moment
to
oppose
my
own
feeble
and
fallible
reason
to
the
mighty
and
infallible
intelligence
of
my
church
at
first
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
was
only
combatting
in
a
respectful
way
against
my
old
friend
rev
leprohon
but
i
had
received
it
from
his
own
lips
that
i
had
really
fought
against
the
lord
after
having
spent
a
long
and
dark
night
of
anguish
and
remorse
my
first
action
the
next
day
was
to
go
to
confession
and
ask
my
confessor
with
tears
of
regret
pardon
for
the
sins
i
had
committed
and
the
scandal
i
had
given
had
i
listened
to
the
voice
of
my
conscience
i
certainly
would
have
left
the
seminary
that
day
for
they
told
me
that
i
had
confounded
my
superior
and
pulverized
all
his
arguments
reason
and
conscience
told
me
that
the
vow
of
celibacy
was
a
sin
against
logic
morality
and
god
that
that
vow
could
not
be
sustained
by
any
argument
from
the
holy
scriptures
logic
or
common
sense
but
i
was
a
most
sincere
roman
catholic
i
had
therefore
to
fight
a
new
battle
against
my
conscience
and
intelligence
so
as
to
subdue
and
silence
them
forever
many
a
time
it
was
my
hope
before
this
to
have
succeeded
in
slaughtering
them
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
of
my
church
but
that
day
far
from
being
forever
silenced
and
buried
they
had
come
out
again
with
renewed
force
to
waken
me
from
the
terrible
illusions
in
which
i
was
living
nevertheless
after
a
long
and
frightful
battle
my
hope
was
that
they
were
perfectly
subdued
and
buried
under
the
feet
of
the
holy
fathers
the
learned
theologians
and
the
venerable
popes
whose
voice
only
i
was
determined
now
to
follow
i
felt
a
real
calm
after
that
struggle
it
was
evidently
the
silence
of
death
although
my
confessor
told
me
it
was
the
peace
of
god
more
than
ever
i
determined
to
have
no
knowledge
no
thought
no
will
no
light
no
desires
no
science
but
that
which
my
church
would
give
me
through
my
superior
i
was
fallible
she
was
infallible
i
was
a
sinner
she
was
the
immaculate
spouse
of
jesus
christ
i
was
weak
she
had
more
power
than
the
great
waters
of
the
ocean
i
was
but
an
atom
she
was
covering
the
world
with
her
glory
what
therefore
could
i
have
to
fear
in
humbling
myself
to
her
feet
to
live
of
her
life
to
be
strong
of
her
strength
wise
of
her
wisdom
holy
with
her
holiness
had
not
my
superior
repeatedly
told
me
that
no
error
no
sin
would
be
imputed
to
me
as
long
as
i
obeyed
my
church
and
walked
in
her
ways
with
these
sentiments
of
a
most
profound
and
perfect
respect
for
my
church
i
irrevocably
consecrated
myself
to
her
service
on
the
of
may
by
making
the
vow
of
celibacy
and
accepting
the
office
of
chapter
xv
the
impurities
of
the
theology
of
rome
the
mother
of
harlots
and
xvii
constrained
by
the
voice
of
my
conscience
to
reveal
the
impurities
of
the
theology
of
the
church
of
rome
i
feel
in
doing
so
a
sentiment
of
inexpressible
shame
they
are
of
such
a
loathsome
nature
that
often
they
can
not
be
expressed
in
any
living
language
however
great
may
have
been
the
corruptions
in
the
theologies
and
priests
of
paganism
there
is
nothing
in
their
records
which
can
be
compared
with
the
depravity
of
those
of
the
church
of
rome
before
the
day
on
which
the
theology
of
rome
was
inspired
by
satan
the
world
had
certainly
witnessed
many
dark
deeds
but
vice
had
never
been
clothed
with
the
mantle
of
theology
most
shameful
forms
of
iniquity
had
never
been
publicly
taught
in
the
schools
of
the
old
pagan
priest
under
the
pretext
of
saving
the
world
no
neither
had
the
priests
or
the
idols
been
forced
to
attend
meetings
where
the
most
degrading
forms
of
iniquity
were
objects
of
the
most
minute
study
and
that
under
the
pretext
of
glorifying
god
let
those
who
understand
latin
read
the
pages
which
i
give
at
the
end
of
my
book
the
priest
the
woman
and
the
confessional
and
then
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
the
sentiments
therein
contained
are
not
enough
to
shock
the
feelings
of
the
most
depraved
and
let
it
be
remembered
that
all
those
abominations
have
to
be
studied
learned
by
heart
and
thoroughly
understood
by
men
who
have
to
make
a
vow
never
to
marry
for
it
is
not
till
after
his
vow
of
celibacy
that
the
student
in
theology
is
into
those
mysteries
of
iniquity
has
the
world
ever
witnessed
such
a
sacrilegious
comedy
a
young
man
about
twenty
years
of
age
has
been
enticed
to
make
a
vow
of
perpetual
celibacy
and
the
very
next
day
the
church
of
rome
puts
under
the
eye
of
his
soul
the
most
infamous
spectacle
she
fills
his
memory
with
the
most
disgusting
images
she
tickles
all
his
senses
and
pollutes
his
ears
not
by
imaginary
representations
but
by
realities
which
would
shock
the
most
abandoned
in
vice
for
let
it
be
well
understood
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
one
to
study
those
questions
of
roman
theology
and
fathom
those
forms
of
iniquity
without
having
his
body
as
well
as
his
mind
plunged
into
a
state
the
most
degrading
moreover
rome
does
not
even
try
to
conceal
the
overwhelming
power
of
this
kind
of
teaching
she
does
not
even
attempt
to
make
it
a
secret
from
the
victims
of
her
incomparable
depravity
but
bravely
tells
them
that
the
study
of
those
questions
will
act
with
an
irresistible
power
upon
those
organs
and
without
a
blush
says
that
pollution
must
follow
but
in
order
that
the
church
of
rome
may
more
certainly
destroy
her
victims
and
that
they
may
not
escape
from
the
abyss
which
she
has
dug
under
their
feet
she
tells
them
there
is
no
sin
for
you
in
those
pollutions
dens
vol
p
but
rome
must
bewitch
so
as
the
better
to
secure
their
destruction
she
puts
to
their
lips
the
cup
of
her
enchantments
the
more
certainly
to
kill
their
souls
dethrone
god
from
their
consciences
and
abrogate
his
eternal
laws
of
holiness
what
answer
does
rome
give
those
who
reproach
her
with
the
awful
impurity
of
her
theology
my
theological
works
she
answers
are
all
written
in
latin
the
people
can
not
read
them
no
evil
no
scandal
therefore
can
come
from
them
but
this
answer
is
a
miserable
subterfuge
is
this
not
the
public
acknowledgment
that
her
theology
would
be
exceedingly
injurious
to
the
people
if
it
were
read
and
understood
by
them
by
saying
my
theological
works
are
written
in
latin
therefore
the
people
can
not
be
defiled
as
they
do
not
understand
them
rome
does
acknowledge
that
these
works
would
only
act
as
a
pestilence
among
the
people
were
they
read
and
understood
by
them
but
are
not
the
one
hundred
thousand
priests
of
rome
bound
to
explain
in
every
known
tongue
and
present
to
the
mind
of
every
nation
the
theology
contained
in
those
books
are
they
not
bound
to
make
every
polluting
sentence
in
them
flow
into
the
ears
imagination
hearts
and
minds
of
all
the
married
and
unmarried
women
whom
rome
holds
in
her
grasp
i
exaggerate
nothing
when
i
say
that
not
fewer
than
half
a
million
women
every
day
are
compelled
to
hear
in
their
own
language
almost
every
polluting
sentence
and
impure
notion
of
the
diabolical
science
and
here
i
challenge
most
fearlessly
the
church
of
rome
to
deny
what
i
say
when
i
state
that
the
daily
average
of
women
who
go
to
confession
to
each
priest
is
ten
but
let
us
reduce
the
number
to
five
then
the
two
hundred
thousand
priests
who
are
scattered
over
the
whole
world
hear
the
confessions
of
one
million
women
every
day
well
now
out
of
one
hundred
women
who
confess
there
are
at
least
whom
the
priest
is
bound
in
conscience
to
pollute
by
questioning
them
on
the
matters
mentioned
in
the
priest
the
woman
and
the
how
can
one
be
surprised
at
the
rapid
downfall
of
the
nations
who
are
under
the
yoke
of
the
pope
the
public
statistics
of
the
european
as
well
as
of
american
nations
show
that
there
is
among
roman
catholics
nearly
double
the
amount
of
prostitution
bastardy
theft
perjury
and
murder
than
is
found
among
protestant
nations
where
must
we
then
look
for
the
cause
of
those
stupendous
facts
if
not
in
the
corrupt
teachings
of
the
theology
of
rome
how
can
the
roman
catholic
nations
hope
to
raise
themselves
in
the
scale
of
christian
dignity
and
morality
as
long
as
there
remain
two
hundred
thousand
priests
in
their
midst
bound
in
conscience
every
day
to
pollute
the
minds
and
the
hearts
of
their
mothers
their
wives
and
their
daughters
and
here
let
me
say
once
for
all
that
i
am
not
induced
to
speak
as
i
do
from
any
motive
of
contempt
or
unchristian
feeling
against
the
theological
professors
who
have
initiated
me
into
those
mysteries
of
iniquity
the
rev
raimbault
and
leprohon
were
and
in
my
mind
they
still
are
as
venerable
as
men
can
be
in
the
church
of
rome
as
i
have
been
myself
and
as
all
the
priests
of
rome
are
they
were
plunged
into
the
abyss
without
understanding
it
into
the
abyss
of
the
most
stolid
ignorance
they
were
crushed
as
i
was
myself
under
a
yoke
which
bound
their
understanding
to
the
dust
and
polluted
their
hearts
without
measure
we
were
embarked
together
on
a
ship
the
first
appearance
of
which
was
really
magnificent
but
the
bottom
of
which
was
irremediably
rotten
without
the
true
pilot
on
board
we
were
left
to
perish
on
unknown
shoals
out
of
this
sinking
ship
the
hand
of
god
alone
in
his
merciful
providence
rescued
me
i
pity
those
friends
of
my
youth
but
despise
them
hate
them
no
never
never
every
time
our
theological
teachers
gave
us
our
lessons
it
was
evident
that
they
blushed
in
the
inmost
part
of
their
souls
their
consciences
as
honest
men
were
evidently
forbidding
them
on
the
one
hand
to
open
their
mouths
on
such
matters
while
on
the
other
hand
as
slaves
and
priests
of
the
pope
they
were
compelled
to
speak
without
reserve
after
our
lessons
in
theology
we
students
used
to
be
filled
with
such
a
sentiment
of
shame
that
sometimes
we
hardly
dared
to
look
at
each
other
and
when
alone
in
our
rooms
those
horrible
pictures
were
affecting
our
hearts
in
spite
of
ourselves
as
the
rust
affects
and
corrodes
the
hardest
and
purest
steel
more
than
one
of
my
told
me
with
tears
of
shame
and
rage
that
they
regretted
to
have
bound
themselves
by
perpetual
oaths
to
minister
at
the
altars
of
the
church
one
day
one
of
the
students
called
desaulnier
who
was
sick
in
the
same
room
with
me
asked
me
chiniquy
what
do
you
think
of
the
matters
which
are
the
objects
of
our
present
theological
studies
is
it
not
a
burning
shame
that
we
must
allow
our
minds
to
be
so
polluted
i
can
not
sufficiently
tell
you
my
feelings
of
disgust
i
answered
had
i
known
sooner
that
we
were
to
be
dragged
over
such
a
ground
i
certainly
never
would
have
nailed
my
future
to
the
banners
under
which
we
are
irrevocably
bound
to
do
you
know
said
desaulnier
that
i
am
determined
never
to
consent
to
be
ordained
a
priest
for
when
i
think
of
the
fact
that
the
priest
is
bound
to
confer
with
women
on
all
these
polluting
matters
i
feel
an
insurmountable
disgust
and
i
am
not
less
troubled
i
replied
my
head
aches
and
my
heart
sinks
within
me
when
i
hear
our
theologians
telling
us
that
we
will
be
in
conscience
bound
to
speak
to
females
on
these
impure
subjects
but
sometimes
this
looks
to
me
as
if
it
were
a
bad
dream
the
impure
phantoms
of
which
will
disappear
at
the
first
awakening
our
church
which
is
so
pure
and
holy
that
she
can
only
be
served
by
the
spotless
virgins
surely
can
not
compel
us
to
pollute
our
lips
thoughts
souls
and
even
our
bodies
by
speaking
to
strange
women
on
matters
so
defiling
but
we
are
near
the
hour
at
which
the
good
leprohon
is
in
the
habit
of
visiting
us
will
you
said
i
promise
to
stand
by
me
on
what
i
shall
ask
him
on
this
subject
i
hope
to
get
from
him
a
pledge
that
we
will
not
be
compelled
to
be
polluted
in
the
confessional
by
the
women
who
will
confess
to
us
the
purity
and
holiness
of
our
superior
is
of
such
a
high
character
that
i
am
sure
he
has
never
said
a
word
to
females
on
those
degrading
matters
in
spite
of
all
the
theologians
leprohon
will
allow
us
to
keep
our
tongues
and
our
hearts
as
well
as
our
bodies
pure
in
the
i
have
had
the
desire
to
speak
to
him
on
this
subject
for
some
time
rejoined
desaulnier
but
my
courage
failed
me
every
time
i
attempted
to
do
so
i
am
glad
therefore
that
you
are
to
break
the
ice
and
i
will
certainly
support
you
as
i
have
a
longing
desire
to
know
something
more
in
regard
to
the
mysteries
of
the
confessional
if
we
be
at
liberty
never
to
speak
to
women
on
those
horrors
i
will
consent
to
serve
the
church
as
a
priest
but
if
not
i
will
never
be
a
a
few
minutes
after
this
our
superior
entered
to
kindly
inquire
how
we
had
rested
the
night
before
having
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
i
opened
the
volumes
of
dens
and
liguori
which
were
on
our
table
and
with
a
blush
putting
my
fingers
on
one
of
the
infamous
chapters
referred
to
i
said
to
him
after
god
you
have
the
first
place
in
my
heart
since
my
mother
s
death
and
you
know
it
i
take
you
not
only
as
my
benefactor
but
also
as
it
were
as
my
father
and
mother
you
will
therefore
tell
me
all
i
want
to
know
in
these
my
hours
of
anxiety
through
which
god
is
pleased
to
make
me
pass
to
follow
your
advice
not
to
say
your
commands
i
have
lately
consented
to
receive
the
order
of
and
i
have
in
consequence
taken
the
vow
of
perpetual
celibacy
but
i
will
not
conceal
the
fact
from
you
that
i
had
not
a
clear
understanding
of
what
i
was
then
doing
and
desaulnier
has
just
stated
to
me
that
until
recently
he
had
no
more
idea
of
the
nature
of
that
promise
nor
of
the
difficulties
which
we
now
see
ahead
of
us
in
our
priestly
life
than
i
had
but
dens
liguori
and
thomas
have
given
us
notions
quite
new
in
regard
to
many
things
they
have
directed
our
minds
to
the
knowledge
of
the
laws
which
are
in
us
as
well
as
in
every
other
child
of
adam
they
have
in
a
word
directed
our
minds
into
regions
which
were
quite
new
and
unexplored
by
us
and
i
dare
say
that
every
one
of
those
whom
we
have
known
whether
in
this
house
or
elsewhere
who
have
made
the
same
vow
could
tell
the
same
tale
however
i
do
not
speak
for
them
i
speak
only
for
myself
and
desaulnier
for
god
s
sake
please
tell
us
if
we
will
be
bound
in
conscience
to
speak
in
the
confessional
to
the
married
and
unmarried
females
on
such
impure
and
defiling
questions
as
are
contained
in
the
theologians
before
us
most
undoubtedly
replied
rev
leprohon
because
the
learned
and
holy
theologians
whose
writings
are
in
your
hands
are
positive
on
that
question
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
question
your
female
penitents
on
such
matters
for
as
a
general
thing
girls
and
married
women
are
too
timid
to
confess
those
sins
of
which
they
are
even
more
frequently
guilty
than
men
therefore
they
must
be
helped
by
questioning
but
have
you
not
i
rejoined
induced
us
to
make
an
oath
that
we
should
always
remain
pure
and
undefiled
how
is
it
then
that
you
put
us
in
such
a
position
that
it
is
almost
an
impossibility
for
us
to
be
true
to
our
sacred
promise
for
the
theologians
are
unanimous
that
those
questions
put
by
us
to
our
female
penitents
together
with
the
recital
of
their
secret
sins
will
act
with
such
an
irresistible
power
upon
us
that
we
will
be
polluted
would
it
not
be
better
for
us
to
feel
those
things
in
the
holy
bonds
of
marriage
with
our
wives
and
according
to
the
laws
of
god
than
in
company
and
conversation
with
strange
women
because
if
we
are
to
believe
the
theologians
which
are
in
our
hands
no
even
you
my
dear
leprohon
can
hear
the
confessions
of
women
without
being
here
desaulnier
interrupted
me
and
said
my
dear
leprohon
i
concur
in
everything
chiniquy
has
just
been
telling
you
would
we
not
be
more
chaste
and
pure
by
living
with
our
lawful
wives
than
by
daily
exposing
ourselves
in
the
confessional
in
company
of
women
whose
presence
will
irresistibly
drag
us
into
the
most
shameful
pit
of
impurity
i
ask
you
my
dear
sir
what
will
become
of
my
vow
of
perfect
and
perpetual
chastity
when
the
seducing
presence
of
my
neighbor
s
wife
or
the
enchanting
words
of
his
daughter
will
have
defiled
me
through
the
confessional
after
all
i
may
be
looked
upon
by
the
people
as
a
chaste
man
but
what
will
i
be
in
the
eyes
of
god
the
people
may
entertain
the
thought
that
i
am
a
strong
and
honest
man
but
will
i
not
be
a
broken
reed
will
god
not
be
the
witness
that
the
irresistible
temptations
which
will
have
assailed
me
when
hearing
the
secret
sins
of
some
sweet
and
tempting
women
will
have
deprived
me
of
that
glorious
crown
of
chastity
for
which
i
have
so
dearly
paid
men
will
think
that
i
am
an
angel
of
purity
but
my
own
conscience
will
tell
me
that
i
am
nothing
but
a
skillful
hypocrite
for
according
to
all
the
theologians
the
confessional
is
the
tomb
of
the
chastity
of
priests
if
i
hear
the
confession
of
women
i
will
be
like
all
other
priests
in
a
tomb
well
painted
and
gilded
on
the
outside
but
within
full
of
francis
desaulnier
just
as
he
had
foretold
me
refused
to
be
a
priest
he
remained
all
his
life
in
the
orders
of
the
in
the
college
of
nicolet
as
a
professor
of
philosophy
he
was
a
man
who
seldom
spoke
in
conversation
but
thought
very
much
it
seems
to
me
that
i
still
see
him
there
under
that
tall
centenary
tree
alone
during
the
long
hours
of
intermission
and
many
long
days
during
our
holidays
while
the
rest
of
the
students
passed
hither
and
thither
singing
and
playing
on
the
enchanting
banks
of
the
river
of
nicolet
he
was
a
good
logician
and
a
profound
mathematician
and
although
affable
to
everyone
he
was
not
communicative
i
was
probably
the
only
one
to
whom
he
opened
his
mind
concerning
the
great
questions
of
history
the
church
and
her
discipline
he
repeatedly
said
to
me
i
wish
i
had
never
opened
a
book
of
theology
our
theologians
are
without
heart
soul
or
logic
many
of
them
approve
of
theft
lies
and
perjury
others
drag
us
without
a
blush
into
the
most
filthy
pits
of
iniquity
every
one
of
them
would
like
to
make
an
assassin
of
every
catholic
according
to
their
doctrine
christ
is
nothing
but
a
corsican
brigand
whose
bloody
disciples
are
bound
to
destroy
all
the
heretics
by
fire
and
sword
were
we
acting
according
to
the
principles
of
those
theologians
we
would
slaughter
all
protestants
with
the
same
coolness
of
blood
as
we
would
shoot
down
the
wolf
which
crosses
our
path
with
their
hand
still
reddened
with
the
blood
of
bartholomew
they
speak
to
us
of
charity
religion
and
god
as
if
there
were
neither
of
them
in
the
desaulnier
was
looked
upon
as
homme
at
nicolet
he
was
really
an
exception
to
all
the
men
in
the
seminary
for
example
though
it
was
the
usage
and
the
law
that
ecclesiastics
should
receive
the
communion
every
month
and
upon
every
great
feast
day
of
the
church
yet
he
would
scarcely
take
the
communion
once
a
year
but
let
me
return
to
the
interview
with
our
superior
desaulnier
s
fearless
and
energetic
words
had
evidently
made
a
very
painful
impression
upon
our
superior
it
was
not
a
usual
thing
for
his
disciples
in
theology
thus
to
take
upon
themselves
to
speak
with
such
freedom
as
we
both
did
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
conceal
his
pain
at
what
he
called
our
unbecoming
and
unchristian
attack
upon
some
of
the
most
holy
ordinances
of
the
church
and
after
he
had
refuted
desaulnier
in
the
best
way
he
could
he
turned
to
me
and
said
my
dear
chiniquy
i
have
repeatedly
warned
you
against
the
habit
you
have
of
listening
to
your
own
frail
reasoning
when
you
should
only
obey
as
a
dutiful
child
were
we
to
believe
you
we
would
immediately
set
ourselves
to
work
to
reform
the
church
and
abolish
the
confession
of
women
to
priests
we
would
throw
all
our
theological
books
into
the
fire
and
have
new
ones
written
better
adapted
to
your
fancy
what
does
all
this
prove
only
one
thing
and
that
is
that
the
devil
of
pride
is
tempting
you
as
he
has
tempted
all
the
reformers
and
destroyed
them
as
he
would
you
if
you
do
not
take
care
you
will
become
another
luther
the
theological
books
of
thomas
liguori
and
dens
have
been
approved
by
the
church
how
therefore
do
you
not
see
the
ridicule
and
danger
of
your
position
on
one
side
then
i
see
all
our
holy
popes
the
two
thousand
catholic
bishops
all
our
learned
theologians
and
priests
backed
up
by
our
two
hundred
millions
of
roman
catholics
drawn
up
as
an
innumerable
army
to
fight
the
battles
of
the
lord
and
on
the
other
side
what
do
i
see
nothing
but
my
small
though
very
dear
chiniquy
how
then
is
it
that
you
do
not
fear
when
with
your
weak
reasoning
you
oppose
the
mighty
reasoning
and
light
of
so
many
holy
popes
venerable
bishops
and
learned
theologians
is
it
not
just
as
absurd
for
you
to
try
to
reform
the
church
by
your
small
reasons
as
it
is
for
the
grain
of
sand
which
is
found
at
the
foot
of
the
great
mountain
to
try
to
turn
that
mighty
mountain
out
of
its
place
or
for
the
small
drop
of
water
to
attempt
to
throw
the
boundless
ocean
out
of
its
bed
or
try
to
oppose
the
running
tides
of
the
polar
seas
believe
me
and
take
my
friendly
advice
continued
our
superior
before
it
is
too
late
let
the
small
grain
of
sand
remain
still
at
the
foot
of
the
majestic
mountain
and
let
the
humble
drop
of
water
consent
to
follow
the
irresistible
currents
of
the
boundless
seas
and
everything
will
be
in
order
all
the
good
priests
who
have
heard
the
confessions
of
women
before
us
have
been
sanctified
and
have
had
their
souls
saved
even
when
their
bodies
were
polluted
for
those
carnal
pollutions
are
nothing
but
human
miseries
which
can
not
defile
a
soul
which
desires
to
remain
united
to
god
are
the
rays
of
the
sun
defiled
by
coming
down
into
the
mud
no
the
rays
remain
pure
and
return
spotless
to
the
shining
orb
whence
they
came
so
the
heart
of
a
good
i
hope
my
dear
chiniquy
will
remain
pure
and
holy
in
spite
of
the
accidental
and
unavoidable
defilement
of
the
flesh
apart
from
those
things
in
your
ordination
you
will
receive
a
special
grace
which
will
change
you
into
another
man
and
the
virgin
mary
to
whom
you
will
constantly
address
yourself
will
obtain
for
you
a
perfect
purity
from
her
son
the
defilement
of
the
flesh
spoken
of
by
the
theologians
and
which
i
confess
is
unavoidable
when
hearing
the
confessions
of
women
must
not
trouble
you
for
they
are
not
sinful
as
dens
and
liguori
assure
us
dens
vol
pages
but
enough
on
that
subject
i
forbid
you
to
speak
to
me
any
more
on
those
idle
questions
and
as
much
as
my
authority
is
anything
to
you
both
i
forbid
you
to
say
a
word
more
to
each
other
on
that
matter
it
was
my
fond
hope
that
my
dear
and
so
much
venerated
leprohon
would
answer
me
with
some
good
and
reasonable
arguments
but
he
to
my
surprise
silenced
the
voice
of
our
conscience
by
coup
d
nevertheless
the
idea
of
that
miserable
grain
of
sand
which
so
ridiculously
attempted
to
remove
the
stately
mountain
and
also
of
that
all
but
perceptible
drop
of
water
which
attempted
to
oppose
itself
to
the
onward
motion
of
the
vast
ocean
singularly
struck
and
humbled
me
i
remained
silent
and
confused
though
not
convinced
this
was
not
all
those
rays
of
the
sun
which
could
not
be
defiled
even
when
going
down
into
the
mud
after
bewildering
one
by
their
glittering
appearance
left
my
soul
more
in
the
dark
than
ever
i
could
not
resist
a
presentiment
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
an
imposition
and
of
a
glittering
sophism
but
i
had
neither
sufficient
learning
moral
courage
nor
grace
from
god
clearly
to
see
through
that
misty
cloud
and
to
expel
it
from
my
mind
almost
every
month
of
the
ten
years
which
i
had
passed
in
the
seminary
of
nicolet
priests
of
the
district
of
three
rivers
and
elsewhere
were
sent
by
the
bishops
to
spend
two
or
three
weeks
in
doing
penances
for
having
bastards
by
their
nieces
their
housekeepers
and
their
fair
penitents
even
not
long
before
this
conversation
with
our
director
the
curate
of
francois
the
rev
amiot
had
in
the
very
same
week
two
children
by
two
of
his
fair
penitents
both
of
whom
were
sisters
one
of
those
girls
gave
birth
to
her
child
at
the
parsonage
the
very
night
on
which
the
bishop
was
on
his
episcopal
visit
to
that
parish
these
public
and
undeniable
facts
were
not
much
in
harmony
with
those
beautiful
theories
of
our
venerable
director
concerning
the
rays
of
the
sun
which
remained
pure
and
undefiled
even
when
warming
and
vivifying
the
mud
of
our
the
facts
had
frequently
occurred
to
my
mind
while
leprohon
was
speaking
and
i
was
tempted
more
than
once
to
ask
him
respectfully
if
he
really
thought
these
shining
rays
the
priests
had
thus
come
into
the
mire
and
would
then
return
like
the
rays
of
the
sun
without
taking
back
with
them
something
of
the
mire
in
which
they
had
been
so
strangely
wallowing
but
my
respect
for
leprohon
sealed
my
lips
when
i
returned
to
my
room
i
fell
on
my
knees
to
ask
god
to
pardon
me
for
having
for
a
moment
thought
otherwise
than
the
popes
and
theologians
of
rome
i
again
felt
angry
with
myself
for
having
dared
for
a
single
moment
to
have
arrayed
my
poor
little
and
imperceptible
grain
of
of
personal
and
contemptible
understanding
against
that
sublime
mountain
of
strength
that
vast
ocean
of
learning
and
that
immensely
divine
wisdom
of
the
popes
but
alas
i
was
not
yet
aware
that
when
jesus
in
his
mercy
sends
into
a
perishing
soul
a
single
ray
of
his
grace
that
there
is
more
light
and
wisdom
in
that
soul
than
in
all
the
popes
and
their
theologians
i
was
then
taught
what
the
real
foundation
of
the
church
of
rome
is
and
sincerely
believed
that
to
think
for
myself
was
a
damnable
to
look
and
see
with
my
own
eyes
and
understand
with
my
own
mind
was
an
unpardonable
sin
to
be
saved
i
had
to
believe
not
what
i
considered
to
be
the
truth
but
what
the
popes
told
me
to
be
the
truth
i
had
to
look
and
see
every
object
of
faith
just
as
every
true
roman
catholic
of
has
to
look
and
see
the
same
through
the
pope
s
eyes
or
those
of
his
theologians
however
absurd
and
impious
this
belief
may
be
yet
it
was
mine
and
it
is
also
the
belief
of
every
true
member
of
the
church
of
rome
the
glorious
light
and
grace
of
god
could
not
possibly
flow
directly
from
him
to
me
they
had
to
pass
through
the
pope
and
his
church
which
were
my
only
mountain
of
strength
and
only
ocean
of
light
it
was
then
my
firm
belief
that
there
was
an
impassable
abyss
between
myself
and
god
and
that
the
pope
and
his
church
were
the
only
bridge
by
which
i
could
have
communication
with
him
that
stupendously
high
and
most
sublime
mountain
the
pope
was
between
myself
and
god
and
all
that
was
allowed
my
poor
soul
was
to
raise
itself
and
travel
with
great
difficulty
till
it
attained
the
foot
of
that
holy
mountain
the
pope
and
prostrating
itself
there
in
the
dust
ask
him
to
let
me
know
what
my
yet
distant
god
would
have
me
do
the
promises
of
mercy
truth
light
and
life
were
all
vested
in
this
great
mountain
the
pope
from
whom
alone
they
could
descend
upon
my
poor
lost
soul
darkness
ignorance
uncertainty
and
eternal
loss
were
my
lot
the
very
moment
i
ceased
worshipping
at
the
feet
of
the
pope
the
god
of
heaven
was
not
god
he
was
only
the
god
of
the
pope
the
saviour
of
the
world
was
not
my
saviour
he
was
only
the
pope
s
therefore
it
was
through
the
pope
only
that
i
could
receive
christ
as
my
saviour
and
to
the
pope
alone
had
i
to
go
to
know
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
of
my
soul
god
alone
knows
what
a
dark
and
terrible
night
i
passed
after
this
meeting
i
had
again
to
smother
my
conscience
dismantle
my
reason
and
bring
them
all
under
the
turpitudes
of
the
theologies
of
rome
which
are
so
well
calculated
to
keep
the
world
fettered
in
ignorance
superstition
and
death
but
god
saw
the
tears
with
which
i
bedewed
my
pillow
that
night
he
heard
the
cry
of
my
agonizing
soul
and
in
his
infinite
love
and
mercy
determined
to
come
to
my
rescue
and
save
me
if
he
saw
fit
to
leave
me
many
years
more
in
the
slavery
of
egypt
it
was
that
i
might
better
know
the
plagues
of
that
land
of
darkness
and
the
iron
chains
which
are
there
prepared
for
poor
lost
souls
when
the
hour
of
my
deliverance
came
the
lord
took
me
by
the
hand
and
helped
me
to
cross
the
red
sea
he
brought
me
to
the
land
of
land
of
peace
life
and
joy
which
passeth
all
understanding
chapter
xvi
the
priest
of
rome
and
the
holy
fathers
or
how
i
swore
to
give
up
the
word
of
god
to
follow
the
word
of
men
there
are
several
imposing
ceremonies
at
the
ordination
of
a
priest
and
i
will
never
forget
the
joy
i
felt
when
the
roman
pontiff
presenting
to
me
the
bible
ordered
me
with
a
solemn
voice
to
study
and
preach
it
that
order
passed
through
my
soul
as
a
beam
of
light
but
alas
those
rays
of
light
and
life
were
soon
to
be
followed
as
a
flash
of
lightning
in
a
stormy
night
by
the
most
sudden
and
distressing
darkness
when
holding
the
sacred
volume
i
accepted
with
unspeakable
joy
the
command
of
studying
and
preaching
its
saving
truth
but
i
felt
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
upon
me
when
i
pronounced
the
awful
oath
which
is
required
from
every
priest
will
never
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
except
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
many
times
with
the
other
students
in
theology
i
had
discussed
the
nature
of
that
strange
oath
still
more
often
in
the
silence
of
my
meditations
alone
in
the
presence
of
god
i
had
tried
to
fathom
the
bottomless
abyss
which
it
seemed
to
me
was
dug
under
my
feet
by
it
and
every
time
my
conscience
had
shrunk
in
terror
from
its
consequences
but
i
was
not
the
only
one
in
the
seminary
who
contemplated
with
an
anxious
mind
its
evidently
blasphemous
nature
about
six
months
before
our
ordination
stephen
baillargeon
one
of
my
fellow
theological
students
had
said
in
my
presence
to
our
superior
the
rev
raimbault
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
one
of
the
things
with
which
i
can
not
reconcile
my
conscience
is
the
solemn
oath
we
will
have
to
take
that
we
will
never
interpret
the
scriptures
except
according
to
the
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
we
have
not
given
a
single
hour
yet
to
the
serious
study
of
the
holy
fathers
i
know
many
priests
and
not
a
single
one
of
them
has
ever
studied
the
holy
fathers
they
have
not
even
got
them
in
their
libraries
we
will
probably
walk
in
their
footsteps
it
may
be
that
not
a
single
volume
of
the
holy
fathers
will
ever
fall
into
our
hands
in
the
name
of
common
sense
how
can
we
swear
that
we
will
follow
the
sentiments
of
men
of
whom
we
know
absolutely
nothing
and
about
whom
it
is
more
probable
we
will
never
know
anything
except
by
mere
vague
hearsay
our
superior
gave
evident
signs
of
weakness
in
his
answer
to
that
unexpected
difficulty
but
his
embarrassment
grew
much
greater
when
i
said
baillargeon
can
not
contemplate
that
oath
without
anxiety
and
he
has
given
you
some
of
his
reasons
but
he
has
not
said
the
last
word
on
that
strange
oath
if
you
will
allow
me
superior
i
will
present
you
some
more
formidable
objections
it
is
not
so
much
on
account
of
our
ignorance
of
the
doctrines
of
the
holy
fathers
that
i
tremble
when
i
think
that
i
will
have
to
swear
never
to
interpret
the
scriptures
except
according
to
their
unanimous
would
to
god
that
i
could
say
with
baillargeon
i
know
nothing
of
the
holy
fathers
how
can
i
swear
that
they
will
guide
me
in
all
my
ways
it
is
true
that
we
know
so
little
of
them
that
it
is
supremely
ridiculous
if
it
is
not
an
insult
to
god
and
man
that
we
take
them
for
our
guides
but
my
regret
is
that
we
know
already
too
much
of
the
holy
fathers
to
be
exempt
from
perjuring
ourselves
when
we
swear
that
we
will
not
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
except
according
to
their
unanimous
consent
is
it
not
a
fact
that
the
holy
fathers
writings
are
so
perfectly
kept
out
of
sight
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
read
and
study
them
but
even
if
we
had
access
to
them
have
we
sufficient
time
at
our
disposal
to
study
them
so
perfectly
that
we
could
conscientiously
swear
that
we
will
follow
them
and
if
we
don
t
study
them
how
can
we
be
exempted
from
wilful
perjury
the
day
that
we
will
swear
to
follow
them
how
can
we
follow
a
thing
we
do
not
see
which
we
do
not
hear
and
about
which
we
do
not
know
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
our
shameful
ignorance
of
the
holy
fathers
is
a
sufficient
reason
to
make
us
fear
at
the
approach
of
the
solemn
hour
that
we
will
swear
to
follow
them
yes
but
we
know
enough
of
the
holy
fathers
to
chill
the
blood
in
our
veins
when
swearing
to
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
only
according
to
their
unanimous
consent
please
superior
tell
us
what
are
the
texts
of
scripture
on
which
the
holy
fathers
are
you
respect
yourself
too
much
to
try
to
answer
a
question
which
no
honest
man
has
or
will
ever
dare
to
answer
and
if
you
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
france
can
not
put
your
finger
on
the
texts
of
the
holy
bible
and
say
the
holy
fathers
are
perfectly
unanimous
on
these
texts
how
can
we
poor
young
ecclesiastics
of
the
humble
college
of
nicolet
say
the
holy
fathers
are
of
the
same
mind
on
those
texts
but
if
we
can
not
distinguish
and
if
we
shall
never
be
able
to
distinguish
between
the
texts
on
which
the
holy
fathers
are
unanimous
and
the
ones
on
which
they
differ
how
can
we
to
swear
before
god
and
man
to
interpret
text
of
the
only
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
by
that
awful
oath
will
we
not
be
absolutely
bound
to
remain
mute
as
dead
men
on
every
text
on
which
the
holy
fathers
have
differed
under
the
evident
penalty
of
becoming
perjured
will
not
every
text
on
which
the
holy
fathers
have
differed
become
as
the
dead
carcass
which
the
israelites
could
not
touch
except
by
defiling
themselves
after
that
strange
oath
to
interpret
the
scriptures
according
to
the
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
will
we
not
be
absolutely
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
studying
or
preaching
on
a
text
on
which
they
have
differed
the
consequences
of
the
oath
are
and
every
one
of
them
seems
to
me
the
death
of
our
ministry
the
damnation
of
our
souls
you
have
read
the
history
of
the
church
as
we
have
it
here
written
by
henrion
and
fleury
well
what
is
the
prominent
fact
in
those
reliable
histories
of
the
church
is
it
not
that
the
church
has
constantly
been
filled
with
the
noise
of
the
controversies
of
holy
fathers
with
holy
fathers
do
we
not
find
on
every
page
that
the
holy
fathers
of
one
century
very
often
differed
from
the
holy
fathers
of
another
century
in
very
important
matters
is
it
not
a
public
and
undeniable
fact
that
the
history
of
our
holy
church
is
almost
nothing
else
than
the
history
of
the
hard
conflict
stern
divisions
unflinching
contradictions
and
oppositions
of
holy
fathers
to
holy
fathers
here
is
a
big
volume
of
manuscript
written
by
me
containing
only
extracts
from
our
best
church
historians
filled
with
the
public
disputes
of
holy
fathers
among
themselves
on
almost
every
subject
of
christianity
there
are
holy
fathers
who
say
with
our
best
modern
thomas
bellarmine
and
we
must
kill
heretics
as
we
kill
wild
beasts
while
many
others
say
that
we
must
tolerate
them
you
all
know
the
name
of
the
holy
father
who
sends
to
hell
all
the
widows
who
marry
a
second
time
while
other
holy
fathers
are
of
a
different
mind
some
of
them
you
know
well
had
very
different
notions
from
ours
about
purgatory
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
give
you
the
names
of
the
holy
fathers
in
africa
and
asia
who
refused
to
accept
the
supreme
jurisdiction
we
acknowledge
in
the
pope
over
all
churches
several
holy
fathers
have
denied
the
supreme
authority
of
the
church
of
know
it
they
have
laughed
at
the
excommunications
of
the
popes
some
even
have
gladly
died
when
excommunicated
by
the
pope
without
doing
anything
to
reconcile
themselves
to
him
what
do
we
find
in
the
six
volumes
of
letters
we
have
still
from
jerome
if
not
the
undeniable
fact
that
he
filled
the
church
with
the
noise
of
his
harsh
denunciations
of
the
scriptural
views
of
augustine
on
many
important
points
you
have
read
those
letters
well
have
you
not
concluded
that
jerome
and
augustine
agreed
almost
only
on
one
thing
which
was
to
disagree
on
every
subject
they
treated
did
not
jerome
knock
his
head
against
nearly
all
the
holy
fathers
of
his
time
and
has
he
not
received
hard
knocks
from
almost
all
the
holy
fathers
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
is
it
not
a
public
fact
that
jerome
and
several
other
holy
fathers
rejected
the
sacred
book
of
the
maccabees
judith
tobias
just
as
the
heretics
of
our
time
reject
them
and
now
we
are
gravely
asked
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
truth
to
swear
that
we
will
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
only
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
those
holy
fathers
who
have
been
unanimous
but
in
one
thing
which
was
never
to
agree
with
each
other
and
sometimes
not
even
with
themselves
for
it
is
a
fact
though
it
is
a
very
deplorable
one
for
instance
that
augustine
did
not
always
keep
to
the
same
correct
views
on
the
text
thou
art
peter
and
upon
that
rock
i
will
build
my
after
holding
correct
views
on
that
fundamental
truth
he
gave
it
up
at
the
end
of
his
life
to
say
with
the
protestants
of
our
day
that
upon
that
rock
means
only
christ
and
not
now
how
can
i
be
bound
by
such
an
oath
to
follow
the
views
of
men
who
have
themselves
been
wavering
and
changing
when
the
word
of
god
must
stand
as
an
unmoving
rock
to
my
heart
if
you
require
from
us
an
oath
why
put
into
our
hands
the
history
of
the
church
which
has
stuffed
our
memory
with
the
undeniable
facts
of
the
endless
fierce
divisions
of
the
holy
fathers
on
almost
every
question
which
the
scriptures
present
to
our
faith
would
to
god
that
i
could
say
with
baillargeon
i
know
nothing
of
the
holy
fathers
then
i
could
perhaps
be
at
peace
with
my
conscience
after
perjuring
myself
by
promising
a
thing
that
i
can
not
do
i
was
lately
told
by
the
rev
leprohon
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
go
to
the
holy
fathers
in
order
to
understand
the
holy
scriptures
but
i
will
respectfully
repeat
what
i
then
said
on
that
subject
if
i
am
too
ignorant
or
too
stupid
to
understand
mark
luke
and
paul
how
can
i
be
intelligent
enough
to
understand
jerome
augustine
and
tertullian
and
if
matthew
john
and
peter
have
not
got
from
god
the
grace
of
writing
with
a
sufficient
degree
of
light
and
clearness
to
be
understood
by
men
of
how
is
it
that
justin
clemens
and
cyprian
have
received
from
our
god
a
favor
of
lucidity
and
clearness
which
he
denied
to
his
apostles
and
evangelists
if
i
can
not
rely
upon
my
private
judgment
when
studying
with
the
help
of
god
the
holy
scriptures
how
can
i
rely
on
my
private
judgment
when
studying
the
holy
fathers
you
constantly
tell
me
i
can
not
rely
on
my
private
judgment
to
understand
and
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
but
will
you
please
tell
me
with
what
judgment
and
intelligence
i
shall
have
to
interpret
and
understand
the
writings
of
the
holy
fathers
if
it
be
not
with
my
own
private
judgment
must
i
borrow
the
judgment
and
intelligence
of
some
of
my
neighbors
in
order
to
understand
and
interpret
for
instance
the
writings
of
origen
or
shall
i
be
allowed
to
go
and
hear
what
that
holy
father
wants
from
me
with
my
own
private
intelligence
but
again
if
you
are
forced
to
confess
that
i
have
nothing
else
but
my
judgment
and
to
read
understand
and
follow
the
holy
fathers
and
that
i
not
only
can
but
i
must
rely
on
my
own
private
judgment
without
any
fear
in
that
case
how
is
it
that
i
will
be
lost
if
i
make
use
of
that
same
and
personal
when
at
the
feet
of
jesus
listening
to
his
eternal
and
words
nothing
distresses
me
so
much
in
our
holy
religion
as
this
want
of
confidence
in
god
when
we
go
to
the
feet
of
jesus
to
hear
or
read
his
words
and
the
abundance
of
when
we
go
among
sinful
and
fallible
men
to
know
what
they
say
it
is
not
to
the
holy
scriptures
that
we
are
invited
to
go
to
know
what
the
lord
saith
it
is
to
the
holy
fathers
would
it
be
possible
that
in
our
holy
church
the
word
of
god
would
be
darkness
and
the
words
of
men
light
this
dogma
or
article
of
our
religion
by
which
we
must
go
to
the
holy
fathers
in
order
to
know
what
the
lord
saith
and
not
to
the
holy
scripture
is
to
my
soul
what
a
handful
of
sand
would
be
to
my
makes
me
perfectly
blind
when
our
venerable
bishop
places
the
holy
scriptures
in
my
hands
and
commands
me
to
study
and
preach
them
i
will
understand
what
he
means
and
he
will
know
what
he
says
he
will
give
me
a
most
sublime
work
to
perform
and
with
the
grace
of
god
i
hope
i
will
do
it
but
when
he
orders
me
to
swear
that
i
will
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
except
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
will
he
not
make
a
perjured
man
of
me
and
will
he
not
say
a
thing
to
which
he
has
not
given
sufficient
attention
for
to
swear
that
we
will
never
interpret
anything
of
the
scriptures
except
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
is
to
swear
to
a
thing
as
impossible
and
ridiculous
as
to
take
the
moon
with
our
hands
i
say
more
it
is
to
swear
that
we
will
never
study
nor
interpret
a
single
chapter
of
the
bible
for
it
is
probable
that
there
are
very
few
chapters
of
that
holy
book
which
have
not
been
a
cause
of
serious
difference
between
some
of
the
holy
fathers
as
the
writings
of
the
holy
fathers
fill
at
least
two
hundred
volumes
in
folio
it
will
not
take
us
less
than
ten
years
of
constant
study
to
know
on
what
question
they
are
or
are
not
unanimous
if
after
that
time
of
study
i
find
that
they
are
on
the
question
of
orthodoxy
which
i
must
believe
and
preach
all
will
be
right
with
me
i
will
walk
with
a
fearless
heart
to
the
gates
of
eternity
and
with
the
certainty
of
following
the
true
way
of
salvation
but
if
among
fifty
holy
fathers
there
are
on
one
side
and
one
only
on
the
opposite
side
in
what
awful
state
of
distress
will
i
be
plunged
will
i
not
be
then
as
a
ship
in
a
stormy
night
after
she
has
lost
her
compass
her
masts
and
her
helm
if
i
were
allowed
to
follow
the
majority
there
would
always
be
a
plank
of
safety
to
rescue
me
from
the
impending
wreck
but
the
pope
has
inexorably
tied
us
to
the
unanimity
if
my
faith
is
not
the
faith
of
i
am
forever
damned
i
am
out
of
the
church
what
a
frightful
alternative
is
just
before
us
we
must
either
perjure
ourselves
by
swearing
to
follow
a
unanimity
which
is
a
fable
in
order
to
remain
roman
catholics
or
we
must
plunge
into
the
abyss
of
impiety
and
atheism
by
refusing
to
swear
that
we
will
adhere
to
a
unanimity
which
never
it
was
visible
at
the
end
of
that
long
and
stormy
conference
that
the
fears
and
anxieties
of
baillargeon
and
mine
were
partaken
of
by
every
one
of
the
students
in
theology
the
boldness
of
our
expressions
brought
upon
us
a
real
storm
but
our
superior
did
not
dare
to
face
or
answer
a
single
one
of
our
arguments
he
was
evidently
embarrassed
and
nothing
could
surpass
his
joy
when
the
bell
told
him
that
the
hour
of
the
conference
was
over
he
promised
to
answer
us
the
next
day
but
the
next
day
he
did
nothing
but
throw
dust
into
our
eyes
and
abuse
us
to
his
heart
s
content
he
began
by
forbidding
me
to
read
any
more
of
the
controversial
books
i
had
bought
a
few
months
before
among
which
was
the
celebrated
derry
discussion
between
seven
priests
and
seven
protestants
i
had
to
give
back
the
discussion
between
pope
and
maguire
and
between
gregg
and
the
same
maguire
i
had
also
to
give
up
the
numbers
of
the
and
other
books
of
lamenais
which
i
had
got
the
liberty
as
a
privilege
to
read
it
was
decided
that
my
intelligence
was
not
clear
enough
and
that
my
faith
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
read
those
books
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
bow
my
head
under
the
yoke
and
obey
without
a
word
of
murmur
the
darkest
night
was
made
around
our
understandings
and
we
had
to
believe
that
that
awful
darkness
was
the
shining
light
of
god
we
rejected
the
bright
truth
which
had
so
nearly
conquered
our
minds
in
order
to
accept
the
most
ridiculous
sophisms
as
gospel
truths
we
did
the
most
degrading
action
a
man
can
silenced
the
voice
of
our
conscience
and
we
consented
to
follow
our
superior
s
views
as
a
brute
follows
the
order
of
his
master
we
consented
to
be
in
the
hands
of
our
superiors
like
a
stick
in
the
hands
of
the
traveler
during
the
months
which
elapsed
between
that
though
lost
battle
and
the
solemn
hour
of
my
priestly
ordination
i
did
all
i
could
to
subdue
and
annihilate
my
thoughts
on
that
subject
my
hope
was
that
i
had
entirely
succeeded
but
to
my
dismay
that
reason
suddenly
awoke
as
from
a
long
sleep
when
i
had
perjured
myself
as
every
priest
has
to
do
a
chill
of
horror
and
shame
ran
through
all
my
frame
in
spite
of
myself
in
my
inmost
soul
a
cry
was
heard
from
my
wounded
conscience
you
annihilate
the
word
of
god
you
rebel
against
the
holy
ghost
you
deny
the
holy
scriptures
to
follow
the
steps
of
sinful
men
you
reject
the
pure
waters
of
eternal
life
to
drink
the
waters
of
in
order
to
choke
again
the
voice
of
my
conscience
i
did
what
my
church
advised
me
to
cried
to
my
wafer
god
and
to
the
blessed
virgin
mary
that
they
might
come
to
my
help
and
silence
the
voices
which
were
troubling
my
peace
by
shaking
my
faith
with
the
utmost
sincerity
the
day
of
my
ordination
i
renewed
the
promise
that
i
had
already
so
often
made
and
said
in
the
presence
of
god
and
his
angels
i
promise
that
i
will
never
believe
anything
except
according
to
the
teachings
of
my
holy
and
apostolic
church
of
and
on
that
pillow
of
folly
ignorance
and
fanaticism
i
laid
my
head
to
sleep
the
sleep
of
spiritual
death
with
the
two
hundred
millions
of
slaves
whom
the
pope
sees
at
his
feet
and
i
slept
that
sleep
till
the
god
of
our
salvation
in
his
great
mercy
awoke
me
by
giving
to
my
soul
the
light
the
truth
and
the
life
which
are
in
jesus
christ
chapter
xvii
the
roman
catholic
priesthood
or
ancient
and
modern
idolatry
i
was
ordained
a
priest
of
rome
in
the
cathedral
of
quebec
on
the
of
september
by
the
right
reverend
sinai
first
archbishop
of
canada
no
words
can
express
the
solemnity
of
my
thoughts
the
superhuman
nature
of
my
aspirations
when
the
delegate
of
the
pope
imposing
his
hands
on
my
head
gave
me
the
power
of
converting
a
wafer
into
the
real
substantial
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
the
bright
illusion
of
eve
as
the
deceiver
told
her
ye
shall
be
as
gods
was
child
s
play
compared
with
what
i
felt
when
assured
by
the
infallible
voice
of
my
church
that
i
was
not
only
on
equal
terms
with
my
saviour
and
god
but
i
was
in
reality
above
him
and
that
hereafter
i
would
not
only
command
but
him
the
aspirations
to
power
and
glory
which
had
been
such
a
terrible
temptation
in
lucifer
were
becoming
a
reality
in
me
i
had
received
the
power
of
commanding
god
not
in
a
spiritual
and
mystical
but
in
a
real
personal
and
most
irresistible
way
with
my
heart
full
of
an
inexpressible
joy
and
gratitude
to
god
and
with
all
the
faculties
of
my
soul
raised
to
exaltation
i
withdrew
from
the
feet
of
the
pontiff
to
my
oratory
where
i
passed
the
rest
of
the
day
in
meditation
on
the
great
things
which
my
god
had
wrought
in
me
i
had
at
last
attained
the
top
of
that
power
and
holiness
which
my
church
had
invited
me
to
consider
from
my
infancy
as
the
most
glorious
gift
which
god
had
ever
given
to
man
the
dignity
which
i
had
just
received
was
above
all
the
dignities
and
the
thrones
of
this
world
the
holy
character
of
the
priesthood
had
been
impressed
on
my
soul
with
the
blood
of
christ
as
an
imperishable
and
celestial
glory
nothing
could
ever
take
it
away
from
me
in
time
or
eternity
i
was
to
be
a
priest
of
my
god
forever
and
ever
not
only
had
christ
let
his
divine
and
priestly
nature
fall
on
my
shoulders
but
he
had
so
perfectly
associated
me
with
himself
as
the
great
and
eternal
sacrificator
that
i
was
to
renew
every
day
of
my
life
his
atoning
sacrifice
at
my
bidding
the
only
and
eternally
begotten
son
of
my
god
was
now
to
come
into
my
hands
in
person
the
same
christ
who
sits
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
was
to
come
down
every
day
into
my
breast
to
unite
his
flesh
to
my
flesh
his
blood
to
my
blood
his
divine
soul
to
my
poor
sinful
soul
in
order
to
walk
work
and
live
in
me
and
with
me
in
the
most
perfect
unity
and
intimacy
i
passed
the
whole
day
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
contemplating
the
superhuman
honors
and
dignities
which
my
beloved
church
had
conferred
on
me
many
times
i
fell
on
my
knees
to
thank
god
for
his
mercies
towards
me
and
i
could
hardly
speak
to
him
except
with
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
i
often
repeated
the
words
of
the
holy
virgin
mary
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
lord
and
my
spirit
doth
rejoice
in
god
my
the
privileges
granted
to
me
were
of
a
more
substantial
kind
than
those
bestowed
upon
mary
she
had
been
obeyed
by
christ
when
he
was
a
child
he
had
to
obey
me
now
although
he
was
in
the
full
possession
of
his
eternal
glory
in
the
presence
of
god
and
his
angels
i
promised
to
live
a
holy
life
as
a
token
of
my
gratitude
to
him
i
said
to
my
lips
and
my
tongue
be
holy
now
for
you
will
not
only
speak
to
your
god
you
will
give
him
a
new
birth
every
day
i
said
to
my
heart
be
holy
and
pure
now
for
you
will
bear
every
day
the
holy
of
to
my
soul
i
said
be
holy
now
for
you
will
henceforth
be
most
intimately
and
personally
united
to
christ
jesus
you
will
be
fed
with
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
him
before
whom
the
angels
do
not
find
themselves
pure
enough
looking
on
my
table
where
my
pipe
filled
with
tobacco
and
my
were
lying
i
said
impure
and
noxious
weeds
you
will
no
more
defile
me
i
am
the
priest
of
the
almighty
it
is
beneath
my
dignity
to
touch
you
any
more
and
opening
the
window
i
threw
them
into
the
street
never
to
make
use
of
them
again
on
the
of
september
i
had
thus
been
raised
to
the
priesthood
but
i
had
not
yet
made
use
of
the
divine
powers
with
which
i
had
been
invested
the
next
day
i
was
to
say
my
first
mass
and
work
that
incomparable
miracle
which
the
church
of
rome
calls
transubstantiation
as
i
have
already
said
i
had
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
night
between
the
and
in
meditation
and
thanksgivings
on
the
morning
of
the
long
before
the
dawn
of
day
i
was
dressed
and
on
my
knees
this
was
to
be
the
most
holy
and
glorious
day
of
my
life
raised
the
day
before
to
a
dignity
which
was
above
the
kingdoms
and
empires
of
the
world
i
was
now
for
the
first
time
to
work
a
miracle
at
the
altar
which
no
angel
or
seraph
could
do
at
my
bidding
christ
was
to
receive
a
new
existence
the
miracle
wrought
by
joshua
when
he
commanded
the
sun
and
moon
to
stop
on
the
bloody
plain
of
gibeon
was
nothing
compared
to
the
miracle
that
i
was
to
perform
that
day
when
the
eternal
son
of
god
would
be
in
my
hands
i
was
to
present
myself
at
the
throne
of
mercy
with
that
expiatory
victim
of
the
sins
of
the
world
pay
the
debt
not
only
of
my
guilty
soul
but
of
all
those
for
whom
i
should
speak
the
ineffable
sacrifice
of
calvary
was
to
be
renewed
by
me
that
day
with
the
utmost
perfection
when
the
bell
rang
to
tell
me
that
the
hour
was
come
to
clothe
myself
with
the
golden
priestly
robes
and
go
to
the
altar
my
heart
beat
with
such
a
rapidity
that
i
came
very
near
fainting
the
holiness
of
the
action
i
was
to
do
the
infinite
greatness
of
the
sacrifice
i
was
about
to
make
the
divine
victim
i
was
to
hold
in
my
hands
and
present
to
god
the
father
the
wonderful
miracle
i
was
to
perform
filled
my
soul
and
my
heart
with
such
sentiments
of
terror
joy
and
awe
that
i
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
if
very
kind
friends
among
whom
was
the
venerable
secretary
of
the
archbishop
of
quebec
now
the
grand
vicar
cazault
had
not
been
there
to
help
and
encourage
me
i
think
i
would
not
have
dared
to
ascend
the
steps
of
the
altar
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
go
through
all
the
ceremonies
of
a
mass
there
are
more
than
hundred
different
ceremonies
and
of
the
body
which
must
be
observed
with
the
utmost
perfection
to
omit
of
them
willingly
or
through
a
culpable
neglect
or
ignorance
is
eternal
damnation
but
thanks
to
a
dozen
exercises
through
which
i
had
gone
the
previous
week
and
thanks
be
to
the
kind
friends
who
helped
and
guided
me
i
went
through
the
performances
of
that
first
mass
much
more
easily
than
i
expected
it
lasted
about
an
hour
but
when
it
was
over
i
was
really
exhausted
by
the
effort
made
to
keep
my
mind
and
heart
in
unison
with
the
infinite
greatness
of
the
mysteries
accomplished
by
me
to
make
one
s
self
believe
that
he
can
convert
a
piece
of
bread
into
god
requires
such
a
supreme
effort
of
the
will
and
complete
annihilation
of
intelligence
that
the
state
of
the
soul
after
the
effort
is
over
is
more
like
death
than
life
i
had
really
persuaded
myself
that
i
had
done
the
most
holy
and
sublime
action
of
my
life
when
in
fact
i
had
been
guilty
of
the
most
outrageous
act
of
idolatry
my
eyes
my
hands
and
lips
my
mouth
and
tongue
and
all
my
senses
as
well
as
the
faculties
of
my
intelligence
were
telling
me
that
what
i
had
seen
touched
eaten
was
nothing
but
a
wafer
but
the
voices
of
the
pope
and
his
church
were
telling
me
that
it
was
the
real
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
i
had
persuaded
myself
that
the
voices
of
my
senses
and
intelligence
were
the
voices
of
satan
and
that
the
deceitful
voice
of
the
pope
was
the
voice
of
the
god
of
truth
every
priest
of
rome
has
to
come
to
that
strange
degree
of
folly
and
perversity
every
day
of
his
life
to
remain
a
priest
of
rome
the
great
imposture
taught
under
the
modern
word
transubstantiation
when
divested
of
the
glare
which
rome
by
his
sorceries
throws
around
it
is
soon
seen
to
be
what
it
impious
and
idolatrous
i
must
carry
the
good
god
to
a
sick
man
says
the
priest
to
his
servant
girl
in
plain
french
je
dois
porter
le
bon
dieu
demain
a
un
malade
dit
le
praitre
a
sa
servante
mais
il
n
y
en
a
plus
dans
le
but
there
are
no
more
in
the
tabernacle
make
some
small
cakes
that
i
may
consecrate
them
and
the
obedient
domestic
takes
some
wheat
flour
for
no
other
kind
of
flour
is
fit
to
make
the
god
of
the
pope
a
mixture
of
any
other
kind
would
make
the
miracle
of
transubstantiation
a
great
failure
the
servant
girl
accordingly
takes
the
dough
and
bakes
it
between
two
heated
irons
on
which
are
graven
the
following
figures
when
the
whole
is
well
baked
she
takes
her
scissors
and
cuts
those
wafers
which
are
about
four
or
five
inches
large
into
smaller
ones
of
the
size
of
an
inch
and
respectfully
hands
them
over
to
the
priest
the
next
morning
the
priest
takes
the
wafers
to
the
altar
and
changes
them
into
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
it
was
one
of
those
wafers
that
i
had
taken
to
the
altar
in
that
solemn
hour
of
my
first
mass
and
which
i
had
turned
into
my
saviour
by
the
five
magical
est
enim
corpus
meum
what
was
the
difference
between
the
incredible
folly
of
aaron
on
the
day
of
his
apostasy
in
the
wilderness
and
the
action
i
had
done
when
i
worshipped
the
god
whom
i
made
myself
and
got
my
friends
to
worship
where
i
ask
is
the
difference
between
the
adoration
of
the
of
aaron
and
the
which
i
had
made
on
the
september
the
only
difference
was
that
the
idolatry
of
aaron
lasted
but
one
day
while
the
idolatry
in
which
i
lived
lasted
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
has
been
perpetuated
in
the
church
of
rome
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
what
has
the
church
of
rome
done
by
giving
up
the
words
of
christ
do
this
in
remembrance
of
me
and
substituting
her
dogma
of
transubstantiation
she
has
brought
the
world
back
to
the
old
heathenism
the
priest
of
rome
worships
a
saviour
called
christ
yes
but
that
christ
is
not
the
christ
of
the
gospel
it
is
a
false
and
christ
whom
the
popes
have
smuggled
from
the
pantheon
of
rome
and
sacrilegiously
called
by
the
adorable
name
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
i
have
often
been
asked
was
it
possible
that
you
sincerely
believed
that
the
wafer
could
be
changed
into
god
by
you
and
have
you
really
worshipped
that
wafer
as
your
saviour
to
my
shame
and
to
the
shame
of
poor
humanity
i
must
say
i
believed
as
sincerely
as
every
roman
catholic
priest
is
bound
to
believe
it
that
i
was
creating
my
own
every
morning
by
the
assumed
consecration
of
the
wafer
and
i
was
saying
to
the
people
as
i
presented
it
to
them
ecce
agnus
dei
this
is
the
lamb
of
god
who
takes
away
the
sins
of
the
world
let
us
adore
him
myself
on
my
knees
i
was
adoring
the
god
made
by
myself
with
the
help
of
my
servant
and
all
the
people
prostrated
themselves
to
adore
the
god
i
must
confess
further
that
though
i
was
bound
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
christ
in
heaven
and
was
invited
by
my
church
to
worship
him
as
my
saviour
and
my
god
i
had
as
every
roman
catholic
has
more
confidence
faith
and
love
towards
the
christ
which
i
had
created
with
a
few
words
of
my
lips
than
towards
the
christ
of
heaven
my
church
told
me
every
day
of
my
life
and
i
had
to
believe
and
preach
it
that
though
the
christ
of
heaven
was
my
saviour
he
was
angry
against
me
on
account
of
my
sins
that
he
was
constantly
disposed
to
punish
me
according
to
his
terrible
justice
that
he
was
armed
with
lightning
and
thunder
to
crush
me
and
that
were
it
not
for
his
mother
who
day
and
night
was
interceding
for
me
i
should
be
cast
into
that
hell
which
my
sins
had
so
richly
deserved
all
the
theologians
with
liguori
at
their
head
whose
writings
i
was
earnestly
studying
and
which
had
received
the
approbation
of
infallible
popes
persuaded
me
that
it
was
mary
whom
i
had
to
thank
and
bless
if
i
had
not
yet
been
punished
as
i
deserved
not
only
had
i
to
believe
this
doctrine
but
i
had
to
preach
it
to
the
people
the
result
was
for
me
as
it
is
for
every
roman
catholic
that
my
heart
was
really
chilled
and
i
was
filled
with
terror
every
time
i
looked
to
the
christ
of
heaven
through
the
lights
and
teachings
of
my
church
he
could
not
as
i
believed
look
to
me
except
with
an
angry
face
he
could
not
stretch
out
his
hand
towards
me
except
to
crush
me
unless
his
merciful
mother
or
some
other
mighty
saint
interposed
their
saving
supplications
to
appease
his
just
indignation
when
i
was
praying
to
that
christ
of
the
church
of
rome
my
mind
was
constantly
perplexed
about
the
choice
i
should
make
of
some
powerful
protector
whose
influence
could
get
me
a
favorable
hearing
from
my
irritated
saviour
besides
this
i
was
told
and
i
had
to
believe
it
that
the
christ
of
heaven
was
a
mighty
monarch
a
most
glorious
king
surrounded
by
innumerable
hosts
of
servants
officers
and
friends
and
that
as
it
would
not
do
for
a
poor
rebel
to
present
himself
before
his
irritated
king
to
get
his
pardon
but
he
must
address
himself
to
some
of
his
most
influential
courtiers
or
to
his
beloved
mother
to
whom
nothing
can
be
refused
that
they
might
plead
his
cause
so
i
sincerely
believed
that
it
was
better
for
me
not
to
speak
myself
to
jesus
christ
but
to
look
for
some
one
who
would
speak
for
me
but
there
would
be
no
such
terrors
or
fears
in
my
heart
when
i
approached
the
saviour
whom
i
had
created
myself
such
an
humble
and
defenceless
saviour
surely
had
no
thunder
in
his
hands
to
punish
his
enemies
he
could
have
no
angry
looks
for
me
he
was
my
friend
as
well
as
the
work
of
my
hands
there
was
nothing
in
him
which
could
inspire
me
with
any
fear
had
i
not
brought
him
down
from
heaven
and
had
he
not
come
into
my
hands
that
he
might
hear
bless
and
forgive
me
he
might
be
nearer
to
me
and
i
nearer
to
him
when
i
was
in
his
presence
in
that
solitary
church
there
was
no
need
of
officers
of
courtiers
of
mothers
to
speak
to
him
for
me
he
was
no
longer
there
a
mighty
monarch
an
angry
king
who
could
be
approached
only
by
the
great
officers
of
his
court
he
was
now
the
rebuked
of
the
world
the
humble
and
defenceless
saviour
of
the
manger
the
forsaken
jesus
of
calvary
the
forgotten
christ
of
gethsemane
no
words
can
give
any
idea
of
the
pleasure
i
used
to
feel
when
alone
prostrated
before
the
christ
whom
i
had
made
at
the
morning
mass
i
poured
out
my
heart
at
his
feet
it
is
impossible
for
those
who
have
not
lived
under
those
terrible
illusions
to
understand
with
what
confidence
i
spoke
to
the
christ
who
was
then
before
me
bound
by
the
ties
of
his
love
for
me
how
many
times
in
the
colder
days
of
winter
in
churches
which
had
never
seen
any
fire
with
an
atmosphere
degrees
below
zero
had
i
passed
whole
hours
alone
in
adoration
of
the
saviour
whom
i
had
made
only
a
few
hours
before
how
often
have
i
looked
with
silent
admiration
to
the
divine
person
who
was
there
alone
passing
the
long
hours
of
the
day
and
night
rebuked
and
forsaken
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
approaching
him
and
of
speaking
to
him
as
a
friend
to
his
friend
as
a
repenting
sinner
to
his
merciful
saviour
my
should
rather
say
my
awful
delusion
was
then
so
complete
that
i
scarcely
felt
the
biting
of
the
cold
i
may
say
with
truth
that
the
happiest
hours
i
ever
had
during
the
long
years
of
darkness
into
which
the
church
of
rome
had
plunged
me
were
the
hours
which
i
passed
in
adoring
the
christ
whom
i
had
made
with
my
own
lips
and
every
priest
of
rome
would
make
the
same
declaration
were
they
questioned
on
the
subject
it
is
a
similar
principle
of
monstrous
faith
that
leads
widows
in
india
to
leap
with
cries
of
joy
into
the
fire
which
will
burn
them
into
ashes
with
the
bodies
of
their
deceased
husbands
their
priests
have
assured
them
that
such
a
sacrifice
will
secure
eternal
happiness
to
themselves
and
their
departed
husbands
in
fact
the
roman
catholics
have
no
other
saviour
to
whom
they
can
betake
themselves
than
the
one
made
by
the
consecration
of
the
wafer
he
is
the
only
saviour
who
is
not
angry
with
them
and
who
does
not
require
the
mediation
of
virgins
and
saints
to
appease
his
wrath
this
is
the
reason
why
roman
catholic
churches
are
so
well
filled
by
the
poor
blind
roman
catholics
see
how
they
rush
to
the
foot
of
their
altars
at
almost
every
hour
of
the
day
sometimes
long
before
the
dawn
go
to
some
of
their
churches
even
on
a
rainy
and
stormy
morning
and
you
will
see
crowds
of
worshippers
of
every
age
and
from
every
grade
of
society
braving
the
storm
and
the
rain
walking
through
the
mud
to
pass
an
hour
at
the
foot
of
their
tabernacles
how
is
it
that
the
roman
catholics
alone
offer
such
a
spectacle
to
the
civilized
world
the
reason
is
very
simple
and
plain
every
soul
yearns
for
a
god
to
whom
it
can
speak
and
who
will
hear
its
supplications
with
a
merciful
heart
and
who
will
wipe
away
her
penitential
tears
just
as
the
flowers
of
our
gardens
turn
naturally
towards
the
sun
which
gives
them
their
color
their
fragrance
and
their
life
so
every
soul
wants
a
saviour
who
is
not
angry
but
merciful
towards
those
who
come
unto
saviour
who
will
say
to
the
weary
and
heavy
laden
come
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
god
in
fine
who
is
not
armed
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
does
not
require
to
be
approached
only
by
saints
virgins
and
martyrs
but
who
through
his
son
jesus
is
the
real
the
true
and
the
only
friend
of
sinners
when
the
people
think
that
there
is
such
a
god
a
loving
saviour
to
be
found
in
the
tabernacle
it
is
but
natural
that
they
should
brave
the
storms
and
the
rains
to
worship
at
his
feet
to
receive
the
pardon
of
their

the

gospel
who
protest
against
the
errors
of
rome
know
that
their
heavenly
father
is
ready
to
hear
forgive
and
help
them
they
know
that
it
is
no
more
at
jerusalem
nor
on
this
or
that
mountain

at
church
that
god
wants
to
be
worshipped
john

they
know
that
their
saviour
liveth
and
is
everywhere
ready
to
hear
those
who
invoke
his
name
that
he
is
no
more
in
that
desert

in

secret
chamber

they
know

he

he
is
ever
near

those
who
look
to
his
bleeding
wounds

want
to
wash
their
robes

they
find
jesus
in

most
secret
closets

they
enter
them
to
pray
meet

with
him

in

speak
to

it
is
not
so
with
the
followers
of

pope
they
are
told
contrary
to
the
gospel
matt

that
christ
is
in
this

secret
chamber

cruelly
deceived
by

priests
they
run

brave
the
storms
to
go
as
near
as
possible
to
that
place

their
merciful
christ
lives
they
go
to
the
christ

will
give
them
a
hearty
welcome
who
will
listen
to
their
humble
prayers
and
be
compassionate
to
their
tears
of
repentance
let
protestants
cease
to
admire
poor
deluded
roman
catholics
who
dare
the
storm
and
go
to
church
even
before
the
dawn
of
day
this
devotion
which
so
dazzles
them
should
excite
compassion
and
not
admiration
for
it
is
the
logical
result
of
the
most
awful
spiritual
darkness
it
is
the
offspring
of
the
greatest
imposture
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
is
the
natural
consequence
of
the
belief
that
the
priest
of
rome
can
create
christ
and
god
by
the
consecration
of
a
wafer
and
keep
him
in
a
secret
chamber
the
egyptians
worshipped
god
under
the
form
of
crocodiles
and
calves
the
greeks
made
their
gods
of
marble
or
of
gold
the
persian
made
the
sun
his
god

go

through
the
storms

adore

the

her
god
out
of
a
piece
of
bread
is
this
not
idolatry
from
the
year
to
the
day
that
god
in
his
mercy
opened
my
eyes
my
servant
had
used
more
than
a
bushel
of
wheat
flour
to
make
the
little
cakes
which
i
had
to
convert
into
the
christ
of
the
mass
some
of
these
i
ate
others
i
carried
about
with
me
for
the
sick
and
others
i
placed
in
the
tabernacle
for
the
adoration
of
the
people
i
am
often
asked
how
is
it
that
you
could
be
guilty
of
such
a
gross
act
of
idolatry
my
only
answer
is
the
answer
of
the
blind
man
of
the
gospel
i
know
not
only
this
one
thing
i
know
that
i
was
blind
and
could
not
see
but
jesus
has
touched
my
eyes
and
now
i
john
ix

chapter
xviii
nine
startling
consequences
of
the
dogma
of
old
paganism
under
a
christian
name
on
the
day
of
my
ordination
to
the
priesthood
i
had
to
believe
with
all
the
priests
of
rome
that
it
was
within
the
limits
of
my
powers
to
go
into
all
the
bakeries
of
quebec
and
change
all
the
loaves
and
biscuits
in
that
old
city
into
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
pronouncing
over
them
the
five
words
hoc
est
enim
corpus
meum
nothing
would
have
remained
of
these
loaves
and
biscuits
but
the
smell
the
color
the
taste
every
bishop
and
priest
of
the
cities
of
new
york
and
boston
chicago
montreal
paris
and
london
firmly
believes
and
teaches
that
he
has
the
power
to
turn
all
the
loaves
of
their
cities
of
their
dioceses
nay
of
the
whole
world
into
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
and
though
they
have
never
yet
found
it
advisable
to
do
that
wonderful
miracle
they
consider
and
say
that
to
entertain
any
doubt
about
the
power
to
perform
that
marvel
is
as
criminal
as
to
entertain
any
doubt
about
the
existence
of
god
when
in
the
seminary
of
nicolet
i
heard
several
times
our
superior
the
rev
raimbault
tell
us
that
a
french
priest
having
been
condemned
to
death
in
paris
when
dragged
to
the
scaffold
had
through
revenge
consecrated
and
changed
into
jesus
christ
all
the
loaves
of
the
bakeries
of
that
great
city
which
were
along
the
streets
through
which
he
had
to
pass
and
though
our
learned
superior
condemned
that
action
in
the
strongest
terms
yet
he
told
us
that
the
consecration
was
valid
and
that
the
loaves
were
really
changed
into
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
the
saviour
of
the
world
and
i
was
bound
to
believe
it
under
pain
of
eternal
damnation
before
my
ordination
i
had
been
obliged
to
learn
by
heart
in
one
of
the
most
sacred
books
of
the
church
of
rome
missale
romanism
the
following
statement
if
after
the
consecration
the
consecrated
bread
disappear
taken
away
by
the
wind
or
through
any
miracle
or
dragged
away
by
an
animal
let
the
priest
take
a
new
bread
consecrate
it
and
continue
his
and
at
page
i
had
learned
if
a
fly
or
spider
fall
into
the
chalice
after
the
consecration
let
the
priest
take
and
eat
it
if
he
does
not
feel
an
insurmountable
repugnance
but
if
he
can
not
swallow
it
let
him
wash
it
and
burn
it
and
throw
the
ashes
into
the
in
the
month
of
january
i
heard
the
following
fact
from
the
rev
paquette
curate
of
gervais
at
a
grand
dinner
which
he
had
given
to
the
neighboring
priests
when
young
i
was
the
vicar
of
a
curate
who
could
eat
as
much
as
two
of
us
and
drink
as
much
as
he
was
tall
and
strong
and
he
has
left
the
dark
marks
of
his
hard
fists
on
the
nose
of
more
than
one
of
his
beloved
sheep
for
his
anger
was
really
terrible
after
he
drank
his
bottle
of
wine
one
day
after
a
sumptuous
dinner
he
was
called
to
carry
the
good
god
le
bon
dieu
to
a
dying
man
it
was
the
cold
was
intense
the
wind
was
blowing
hard
there
was
at
least
five
or
six
feet
of
snow
and
the
roads
were
almost
impassable
it
was
really
a
serious
matter
to
travel
nine
miles
on
such
a
day
but
there
was
no
help
the
messenger
was
one
of
the
first
marguilliers
elders
who
was
very
pressing
and
the
dying
man
was
one
of
the
first
citizens
of
the
place
the
curate
after
a
few
grumblings
drank
a
tumbler
of
good
jamaica
with
his
marguillier
as
a
preventative
against
the
cold
went
to
church
took
the
good
god
le
bon
dieu
and
threw
himself
into
the
sleigh
wrapped
as
well
as
possible
in
his
large
buffalo
robes
though
there
were
two
horses
one
before
the
other
to
drag
the
sleigh
the
journey
was
a
long
and
tedious
one
which
was
made
still
worse
by
an
unlucky
circumstance
they
were
met
by
another
traveler
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
the
road
was
too
narrow
to
allow
the
two
sleighs
and
horses
to
remain
easily
on
firm
ground
when
passing
by
each
other
and
it
would
have
required
a
good
deal
of
skill
and
patience
in
driving
the
horses
to
prevent
them
from
falling
into
the
soft
snow
it
is
well
known
that
when
once
horses
are
sunk
into
five
or
six
feet
of
snow
the
more
they
struggle
the
deeper
they
sink
the
marguillier
who
was
carrying
the
good
god
with
the
cure
naturally
hoped
to
have
the
privilege
of
keeping
the
middle
of
the
road
and
escaping
the
danger
of
getting
his
horses
wounded
and
his
sleigh
broken
he
cried
to
the
other
traveler
in
a
high
tone
of
authority
traveler
let
me
have
the
road
turn
your
horses
into
the
snow
make
haste
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
carry
the
good
god
unfortunately
the
traveler
was
a
heretic
who
cared
much
more
for
his
horses
than
for
the
good
he
answered
le
diable
emporte
ton
bon
dieu
avant
que
je
ne
casse
le
cou
de
mon
cheval
the
devil
take
your
god
before
i
consent
to
break
the
neck
of
my
horse
if
your
god
has
not
taught
you
the
rules
of
law
and
of
common
sense
i
will
give
you
a
free
lecture
on
that
matter
and
jumping
out
of
his
sleigh
he
took
the
reins
of
the
front
horse
of
the
marguillier
to
help
him
to
walk
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
keep
the
half
of
it
for
himself
but
the
marguillier
who
was
naturally
a
very
impatient
and
fearless
man
had
drank
too
much
with
my
curate
before
he
left
the
parsonage
to
keep
cool
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
also
jumped
out
of
his
sleigh
ran
to
the
stranger
took
his
cravat
in
his
left
hand
and
raised
his
right
one
to
strike
him
in
the
face
unfortunately
for
him
the
heretic
seemed
to
have
foreseen
all
this
he
had
left
his
overcoat
in
the
sleigh
and
was
more
ready
for
the
conflict
than
his
assailant
he
was
also
a
real
giant
in
size
and
strength
as
quick
as
lightning
his
right
and
left
fists
fell
like
iron
masses
on
the
face
of
the
poor
marguillier
and
threw
him
on
his
back
in
the
soft
snow
where
he
almost
disappeared
till
then
the
curate
had
been
a
silent
spectator
but
the
sight
and
the
cries
of
his
friend
whom
the
stranger
was
pommelling
without
mercy
made
him
lose
his
patience
taking
the
little
silk
bag
which
contained
the
good
god
from
about
his
neck
where
it
was
tied
he
put
it
on
the
seat
of
the
sleigh
and
said
dear
good
god
please
remain
neutral
i
must
help
my
marguillier
take
no
part
in
this
conflict
and
i
will
punish
that
infamous
protestant
as
he
but
the
unfortunate
marguillier
was
entirely
put
de
before
the
curate
could
go
to
his
help
his
face
was
horribly
teeth
were
lower
jaw
dislocated
and
the
eyes
were
so
terribly
damaged
that
it
took
several
days
before
he
could
see
anything
when
the
heretic
saw
the
priest
coming
to
renew
the
battle
he
threw
down
his
other
coat
to
be
freer
in
his
movements
the
curate
had
not
been
so
wise
relying
too
much
on
his
herculean
strength
covered
with
his
heavy
overcoat
on
which
was
his
white
surplice
he
threw
himself
on
the
stranger
like
a
big
rock
which
falls
from
the
mountain
and
rolls
upon
the
oak
below
both
of
these
combatants
were
real
giants
and
the
first
blows
must
have
been
terrible
on
both
sides
but
the
infamous
heretic
probably
had
not
drank
so
much
as
my
curate
before
leaving
home
or
perhaps
he
was
more
expert
in
the
exchange
of
these
bloody
jokes
the
battle
was
long
and
the
blood
flowed
pretty
freely
on
both
sides
the
cries
of
the
combatants
might
have
been
heard
at
a
long
distance
were
it
not
for
the
roaring
noise
of
the
wind
which
at
that
instant
was
blowing
a
hurricane
the
storm
the
cries
the
blows
the
blood
the
surplice
and
the
overcoat
of
the
priest
torn
to
rags
the
shirt
of
the
stranger
reddened
with
gore
made
such
a
terrible
spectacle
that
in
the
end
the
horses
of
the
marguillier
though
animals
took
fright
and
threw
themselves
into
the
snow
turned
their
backs
to
the
storm
and
made
for
home
they
dragged
the
fragments
of
the
upset
sleigh
a
pretty
long
distance
and
arrived
at
the
door
of
their
stable
with
only
some
diminutive
parts
of
the
harness
the
good
god
had
evidently
heard
the
prayer
of
my
curate
and
he
had
remained
neutral
at
all
events
he
had
not
taken
the
part
of
his
priest
for
he
lost
the
day
and
the
infamous
protestant
remained
master
of
the
the
curate
had
to
help
his
marguillier
out
of
the
snow
in
which
he
was
buried
and
where
he
had
lain
like
a
slaughtered
ox
both
had
to
walk
or
rather
crawl
nearly
half
a
mile
in
snow
to
their
knees
before
they
could
reach
the
nearest
farmhouse
where
they
arrived
when
it
was
dark
but
the
worst
is
not
told
you
remember
when
my
curate
had
put
the
box
containing
the
good
god
on
the
seat
of
the
sleigh
before
going
to
fight
the
horses
had
dragged
the
sleigh
a
certain
distance
upset
and
smashed
it
the
little
silk
bag
with
the
silver
box
and
its
precious
contents
was
lost
in
the
snow
and
though
several
hundred
people
had
looked
for
it
several
days
at
different
times
it
could
not
be
found
it
was
only
late
in
the
month
of
june
that
a
little
boy
seeing
some
rags
in
the
mud
of
the
ditch
along
the
highway
lifted
them
and
a
little
silver
box
fell
out
suspecting
that
it
was
what
the
people
had
looked
for
so
many
days
during
the
last
winter
he
took
it
to
the
parsonage
i
was
there
when
it
was
opened
we
had
the
hope
that
the
good
god
would
be
found
pretty
intact
but
we
were
doomed
to
be
disappointed
good
god
was
entirely
melted
away
le
bon
dieu
etait
fondu
during
the
recital
of
that
spicy
story
which
was
told
in
the
most
amusing
and
comical
way
the
priests
had
drunk
freely
and
laughed
heartily
but
when
the
conclusion
came
le
bon
dieu
etait
fondu
the
good
god
was
melted
away
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
such
as
i
never
priests
striking
the
floor
with
their
feet
and
the
table
with
their
hands
filled
the
house
with
the
cries
the
good
god
melted
away
the
good
god
melted
away
le
bon
dieu
est
fondu
le
bon
dieu
est
fondu
yes
the
god
of
rome
dragged
away
by
a
drunken
priest
and
really
melted
away
in
the
muddy
ditch
this
glorious
fact
was
proclaimed
by
his
own
priests
in
the
midst
of
convulsive
laughter
and
at
tables
covered
with
scores
of
bottles
just
emptied
by
them
about
the
middle
of
march
i
had
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
days
of
my
roman
catholic
priestly
life
at
about
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
a
poor
irishman
had
come
in
haste
from
beyond
the
high
mountains
between
lake
beauport
and
the
river
morency
to
ask
me
to
go
and
anoint
a
dying
woman
it
took
me
ten
minutes
to
run
to
the
church
put
the
good
god
in
the
little
silver
box
shut
the
whole
in
my
vest
pocket
and
jump
into
the
irishman
s
rough
sleigh
the
roads
were
exceedingly
bad
and
we
had
to
go
very
slowly
at
we
were
yet
more
than
three
miles
from
the
sick
woman
s
house
it
was
very
dark
and
the
horse
was
so
exhausted
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
any
further
through
the
gloomy
forest
i
determined
to
pass
the
night
at
a
poor
irish
cabin
which
was
near
the
road
i
knocked
at
the
door
asked
hospitality
and
was
welcomed
with
that
demonstration
of
respect
which
the
roman
catholic
irishman
knows
better
than
any
other
man
how
to
pay
to
his
priests
the
shanty
feet
long
by
sixteen
wide
was
built
with
round
logs
between
which
a
liberal
supply
of
clay
instead
of
mortar
had
been
thrown
to
prevent
the
wind
and
cold
from
entering
six
fat
though
not
absolutely
healthy
boys
and
girls
presented
themselves
around
their
good
parents
as
the
living
witnesses
that
this
cabin
in
spite
of
its
ugly
appearance
was
really
a
happy
home
for
its
dwellers
besides
the
eight
human
beings
sheltered
beneath
that
hospitable
roof
i
saw
at
one
end
a
magnificent
cow
with
her
newborn
calf
and
two
fine
pigs
these
two
last
boarders
were
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
family
only
by
a
branch
partition
two
or
three
feet
high
please
your
reverence
said
the
good
woman
after
she
had
prepared
our
supper
excuse
our
poverty
but
be
sure
that
we
feel
happy
and
much
honored
to
have
you
in
our
humble
dwelling
for
the
night
my
only
regret
is
that
we
have
only
potatoes
milk
and
butter
to
give
you
for
your
supper
in
these
backwoods
tea
sugar
and
wheat
flour
are
unknown
i
thanked
that
good
woman
for
her
hospitality
and
caused
her
to
rejoice
not
a
little
by
assuring
her
that
good
potatoes
fresh
butter
and
milk
were
the
best
delicacies
which
could
be
offered
to
me
in
any
place
i
sat
at
the
table
and
ate
one
of
the
most
delicious
suppers
of
my
life
the
potatoes
were
exceedingly
butter
cream
and
milk
of
the
best
quality
and
my
appetite
was
not
a
little
sharpened
by
the
long
journey
over
the
steep
mountains
i
had
not
told
these
good
people
nor
even
my
driver
that
i
had
le
bon
dieu
the
good
god
with
me
in
my
vest
pocket
it
would
have
made
them
too
uneasy
and
would
have
added
too
much
to
my
other
difficulties
when
the
time
of
sleeping
arrived
i
went
to
bed
with
all
my
clothing
and
slept
well
for
i
was
very
tired
by
the
tedious
and
broken
roads
from
beauport
to
these
distant
mountains
next
morning
before
breakfast
and
the
dawn
of
day
i
was
up
and
as
soon
as
we
had
a
glimpse
of
light
to
see
our
way
i
left
for
the
house
of
the
sick
woman
after
offering
a
silent
prayer
i
had
not
traveled
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
i
put
my
hand
into
my
vest
pocket
and
to
my
indescribable
dismay
i
found
that
the
little
silver
box
containing
the
good
god
was
missing
a
cold
sweat
ran
through
my
frame
i
told
my
driver
to
stop
and
turn
back
immediately
that
i
had
lost
something
which
might
be
found
in
the
bed
where
i
had
slept
it
did
not
take
five
minutes
to
retrace
our
way
on
opening
the
door
i
found
the
poor
woman
and
her
husband
almost
besides
themselves
and
distressed
beyond
measure
they
were
pale
and
trembling
as
criminals
who
expected
to
be
condemned
did
you
not
find
a
little
silver
box
after
i
left
i
said
o
my
god
answered
the
desolate
woman
yes
i
have
found
it
but
would
to
god
i
had
never
seen
it
there
it
but
why
do
you
regret
finding
it
when
i
am
too
happy
to
find
it
here
safe
in
your
hands
i
replied
ah
your
reverence
you
do
not
know
what
a
terrible
misfortune
has
just
happened
to
me
not
more
than
half
a
minute
before
you
knocked
at
the
what
misfortune
can
have
fallen
upon
you
in
so
short
a
time
i
answered
well
please
your
reverence
open
the
little
box
and
you
will
understand
i
opened
it
but
the
good
god
was
not
in
it
looking
in
the
face
of
the
poor
distressed
woman
i
asked
her
what
does
this
mean
it
is
empty
it
means
answered
she
that
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
of
women
not
more
than
five
minutes
after
you
had
left
the
house
i
went
to
your
bed
and
found
that
little
box
not
knowing
what
it
was
i
showed
it
to
my
children
and
to
my
husband
i
asked
him
to
open
it
but
he
refused
to
do
it
i
then
turned
it
on
every
side
trying
to
guess
what
it
could
contain
till
the
devil
tempted
me
so
much
that
i
determined
to
open
it
i
came
to
this
corner
where
this
pale
lamp
is
used
to
remain
on
that
little
shelf
and
i
opened
it
but
o
my
god
i
do
not
dare
to
tell
the
at
these
words
she
fell
on
the
floor
in
a
fit
of
nervous
cries
were
piercing
her
mouth
was
foaming
she
was
cruelly
tearing
her
hair
with
her
own
hands
the
shrieks
and
lamentations
of
the
children
were
so
distressing
that
i
could
hardly
prevent
myself
from
crying
also
after
a
few
moments
of
the
most
agonizing
anxiety
seeing
that
the
poor
woman
was
becoming
calm
i
addressed
myself
to
the
husband
and
said
please
give
me
the
explanation
of
these
strange
things
he
could
hardly
speak
at
first
but
as
i
was
very
pressing
he
told
me
with
a
trembling
voice
please
your
reverence
look
into
that
vessel
that
the
children
use
and
you
will
perhaps
understand
our
desolation
when
my
wife
opened
the
little
silver
box
she
did
not
observe
the
vessel
was
there
just
beneath
her
hands
in
the
opening
what
was
in
the
silver
box
fell
into
that
vase
and
sank
we
were
all
filled
with
consternation
when
you
knocked
at
the
door
and
i
felt
struck
with
such
unspeakable
horror
at
the
thought
that
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
my
saviour
jesus
christ
was
there
sunk
into
that
vase
that
i
remained
speechless
and
for
a
long
time
did
not
know
what
to
do
at
first
it
came
to
my
mind
to
plunge
my
hands
into
the
vase
and
try
to
get
my
saviour
out
of
that
sepulchre
of
ignominy
but
i
could
not
muster
courage
to
do
so
at
last
i
requested
the
poor
desolated
family
to
dig
a
hole
three
feet
deep
in
the
ground
and
deposit
it
with
its
contents
and
i
left
the
house
after
i
had
forbidden
them
from
ever
saying
a
word
about
that
awful
calamity
in
one
of
the
most
sacred
books
of
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
church
of
rome
missale
romanism
we
read
page
if
the
priest
after
the
communion
vomit
and
that
in
the
vomited
matter
the
consecrated
bread
appears
let
him
swallow
what
he
has
vomited
but
if
he
feels
too
much
repugnance
to
swallow
it
let
him
separate
the
body
of
christ
the
consecrated
bread
from
the
vomited
matter
till
it
be
entirely
corrupted
and
then
throw
it
into
the
when
a
priest
of
rome
i
was
bound
with
all
the
roman
catholics
to
believe
that
christ
had
taken
his
own
body
with
his
own
hand
to
his
mouth
and
that
he
had
eaten
himself
not
in
a
spiritual
but
in
a
substantial
material
way
after
eating
himself
he
had
given
himself
to
each
one
of
his
apostles
who
then
ate
him
also
before
closing
this
chapter
let
the
reader
allow
me
to
ask
him
if
the
world
in
its
darkest
ages
of
paganism
has
ever
witnessed
such
a
system
of
idolatry
so
debasing
impious
ridiculous
and
diabolical
in
its
consequences
as
the
church
of
rome
teaches
in
the
dogma
of
transubstantiation
when
with
the
light
of
the
gospel
in
hand
the
christian
goes
into
those
horrible
recesses
of
superstition
folly
and
impiety
he
can
hardly
believe
what
his
eyes
see
and
his
ears
hear
it
seems
impossible
that
men
can
consent
to
worship
a
god
whom
the
rats
can
eat
a
god
who
can
be
dragged
away
and
lost
in
a
muddy
ditch
by
a
drunken
priest
a
god
who
can
be
eaten
vomited
and
eaten
again
by
those
who
are
courageous
enough
to
eat
again
what
they
have
vomited
the
religion
of
rome
is
not
a
religion
it
is
the
mockery
the
destruction
the
ignominious
carricature
of
religion
the
church
of
rome
as
a
public
fact
is
nothing
but
the
accomplishment
of
the
awful
prophecy
because
they
receive
not
the
love
of
the
truth
that
they
might
be
saved
god
shall
send
them
strong
delusions
that
they

on
the
september

casault
secretary
of
the
bishop
of
quebec
presented
to
me
the
official
letters
which
named
me
the
vicar
of
the
rev
perras
and
curate
of
charles
rivierre
boyer
and
i
was
soon
on
my
way
with
a
cheerful
heart
to
fill
the
post
assigned
to
me
by
my
superior
the
parish
of
charles
is
beautifully
situated
about
twenty
miles
of
quebec
on
the
banks
of
a
river
which
flows
in
its
very
midst
from
north
to
south
its
large
and
barns
neatly
with
lime
were
the
symbols
of
peace
and
comfort
the
vandal
axe
had
not
yet
destroyed
the
centenary
forests
which
covered
the
country
on
almost
every
farm
a
splendid
grove
of
maples
had
been
reserved
as
the
witness
of
the
intelligence
and
taste
of
the
people
i
had
often
heard
of
the
rev
perras
as
one
of
the
most
learned
pious
and
venerable
priests
of
canada
i
had
even
been
told
that
several
of
the
governors
of
quebec
had
chosen
him
for
the
french
teacher
of
their
children
when
i
arrived
he
was
absent
on
a
sick
call
but
his
sister
received
me
with
every
mark
of
refined
politeness
under
the
burden
of
her
five
and
fifty
years
she
had
kept
all
the
freshness
and
amiability
of
youth
after
a
few
words
of
welcome
she
showed
me
my
study
and
sleeping
room
they
were
both
perfumed
with
the
fragrance
of
two
magnificent
bouquets
of
the
choicest
flowers
on
the
top
of
one
of
which
was
written
the
words
welcome
to
the
angel
whom
the
lord
sends
to
us
as
his
the
two
rooms
were
the
perfection
of
neatness
and
comfort
i
shut
the
doors
and
fell
on
my
knees
to
thank
god
and
the
blessed
virgin
for
having
given
me
such
a
home
ten
minutes
later
i
came
back
to
the
large
parlor
where
i
found
miss
perras
waiting
for
me
to
offer
me
a
glass
of
wine
and
some
excellent
pain
de
savoie
as
it
was
the
universal
custom
then
to
do
in
every
respectable
house
she
then
told
me
how
her
brother
the
curate
and
herself
were
happy
when
they
heard
that
i
was
to
come
and
live
with
them
she
had
known
my
mother
before
her
marriage
and
she
told
me
how
she
had
passed
several
happy
days
in
her
company
she
could
not
speak
to
me
of
any
subject
more
interesting
than
my
mother
for
though
she
had
died
a
few
years
before
she
had
never
ceased
to
be
present
to
my
mind
and
near
and
dear
to
my
heart
miss
perras
had
not
spoken
long
when
the
curate
arrived
i
rose
to
meet
him
but
it
is
impossible
to
adequately
express
what
i
felt
at
that
moment
the
israelites
were
hardly
struck
with
more
awe
when
they
saw
moses
coming
down
from
mount
sinai
than
i
was
at
the
first
sight
i
had
of
that
venerable
man
rev
perras
was
then
about
years
old
he
was
a
tall
a
giant
no
army
officer
no
king
ever
bore
his
head
with
more
dignity
but
his
beautiful
blue
eyes
which
were
the
embodiment
of
kindness
tempered
the
dignity
of
his
mien
his
hair
which
was
beginning
to
whiten
had
not
yet
lost
its
golden
lustre
it
seemed
as
if
silver
and
gold
were
mixed
on
his
head
to
adorn
and
beautify
it
there
was
on
his
face
an
expression
of
peace
calm
piety
and
kindness
which
entirely
won
my
heart
and
respect
when
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
he
extended
his
hands
towards
me
i
felt
beside
myself
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
said
mr
perras
god
sends
me
to
you
that
you
may
be
my
teacher
and
my
father
you
will
have
to
guide
my
first
and
inexperienced
steps
in
the
holy
ministry
do
bless
me
and
pray
that
i
may
be
a
good
priest
as
you
are
that
unpremeditated
and
earnest
act
of
mine
so
touched
the
good
old
priest
that
he
could
hardly
speak
leaning
towards
me
he
raised
me
up
and
pressed
me
to
his
bosom
and
with
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
he
said
may
god
bless
you
my
dear
sir
and
may
he
also
be
blessed
for
having
chosen
you
to
help
me
carry
the
burden
of
the
holy
ministry
in
my
old
after
of
the
most
interesting
conversation
he
showed
me
his
library
which
was
very
large
and
composed
of
the
best
books
which
a
priest
of
rome
is
allowed
to
read
and
he
very
kindly
put
it
at
my
service
next
morning
after
breakfast
he
handed
me
a
large
and
neat
sheet
of
paper
headed
by
these
latin
words
ordo
ducit
ad
it
was
the
rule
of
life
which
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
to
guide
all
the
hours
of
the
day
in
such
a
way
that
not
a
moment
could
be
given
to
idleness
or
vain
pastime
would
you
be
kind
enough
he
said
to
read
this
and
tell
me
if
it
suits
your
views
i
have
found
great
spiritual
and
temporal
benefits
in
following
these
rules
of
life
and
would
be
very
happy
if
my
dear
young
coadjutor
would
unite
with
me
in
walking
in
the
ways
of
an
orderly
christian
and
priestly
life
i
read
this
document
with
interest
and
pleasure
and
handed
it
back
to
him
saying
i
will
be
very
happy
with
the
help
of
god
to
follow
with
you
the
wise
rules
set
down
here
for
a
holy
and
priestly
thinking
that
these
rules
might
be
interesting
to
the
reader
i
give
them
here
in
full
rising
prayer
and
meditation
to
mass
hearing
confession
and
recitation
of
brevarium
to
breakfast
visitation
of
the
sick
and
reading
the
lives
of
to
the
saints
study
of
philosophical
historical
or
theological
books
to
dinner
to
recreation
and
conversation
to
recitation
of
vespers
to
study
of
history
theology
or
philosophy
to
visit
to
the
holy
sacrament
and
reading
imitation
of
jesus
christ
to
hearing
of
confessions
or
visit
to
the
sick
or
study
to
supper
to
recreation
to
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
prayer
to
going
to
bed
such
was
our
daily
life
during
the
eight
months
which
it
was
my
privilege
to
remain
with
the
venerable
perras
except
that
thursdays
were
invariably
given
to
visit
some
of
the
neighboring
curates
and
the
sabbath
days
spent
in
hearing
confessions
and
performing
the
public
services
of
the
church
the
conversation
of
perras
was
generally
exceedingly
interesting
i
never
heard
from
him
any
idle
frivolous
talking
as
it
is
so
much
the
habit
among
the
priests
he
was
well
versed
in
the
literature
philosophy
history
and
theology
of
rome
he
had
personally
known
almost
all
the
bishops
and
priests
of
the
last
fifty
years
and
his
memory
was
well
stored
with
anecdotes
and
facts
concerning
the
clergy
from
almost
the
days
of
the
conquest
of
canada
i
could
write
many
interesting
things
were
i
to
publish
what
i
heard
from
him
concerning
the
doings
of
the
clergy
i
will
only
give
two
or
three
of
the
facts
of
that
interesting
period
of
the
church
in
canada
a
couple
of
months
before
my
arrival
at
charles
the
vicar
who
preceded
me
called
lajus
had
publicly
eloped
with
one
of
his
beautiful
penitents
who
after
three
months
of
public
scandal
had
repented
and
come
back
to
her
parents
about
the
same
time
a
neighboring
curate
in
whom
i
had
great
confidence
compromised
himself
also
with
one
of
his
fair
parishioners
in
a
most
shameful
though
less
public
way
these
two
scandals
which
came
to
my
knowledge
almost
at
the
same
time
distressed
me
exceedingly
and
for
nearly
a
week
i
felt
so
overwhelmed
with
shame
that
i
dreaded
to
show
my
face
in
public
and
i
almost
regretted
that
i
ever
became
a
priest
my
nights
were
sleepless
the
best
viands
of
the
table
had
lost
their
relish
i
could
hardly
eat
anything
my
conversations
with
perras
had
lost
their
charms
i
even
could
hardly
talk
with
him
or
anybody
else
are
you
sick
my
young
friend
said
he
to
me
one
day
no
sir
i
am
not
sick
but
i
am
he
replied
can
i
know
the
cause
of
your
sadness
you
used
to
be
so
cheerful
and
happy
since
you
came
here
i
must
bring
you
back
to
your
former
happy
frame
of
mind
please
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
know
many
remedies
for
the
soul
as
well
as
for
the
body
open
your
heart
to
me
and
i
hope
soon
to
see
that
dark
cloud
which
is
over
you
pass
the
two
last
awful
scandals
given
by
the
priests
i
answered
are
the
cause
of
my
sadness
the
news
of
the
fall
of
these
two
confreres
one
of
whom
seemed
to
me
so
respectable
has
fallen
upon
me
like
a
thunderbolt
though
i
had
heard
something
of
that
nature
when
i
was
a
simple
ecclesiastic
in
the
college
i
had
not
the
least
idea
that
such
was
the
life
of
so
many
priests
the
fact
of
the
human
frailty
of
so
many
is
really
distressing
how
can
one
hope
to
stand
up
on
one
s
feet
when
he
sees
such
strong
men
fall
by
one
s
side
what
will
become
of
our
holy
church
in
canada
and
all
over
the
world
if
her
most
devoted
priests
are
so
weak
and
have
so
little
and
so
little
fear
of
god
my
dear
young
friend
answered
perras
our
holy
church
is
infallible
the
gates
of
hell
can
not
prevail
against
her
but
the
assurance
of
her
perpetuity
and
infallibility
does
not
rest
on
any
human
foundation
it
does
not
rest
on
the
personal
holiness
of
her
priests
but
it
rests
on
the
promises
of
jesus
christ
her
perpetuity
and
infallibility
are
a
perpetual
miracle
it
requires
the
constant
working
of
jesus
christ
to
keep
her
pure
and
holy
in
spite
of
the
sins
and
scandals
of
her
priests
even
the
clearest
proof
that
our
holy
church
has
a
promise
of
perpetuity
and
infallibility
is
drawn
from
the
very
sins
and
scandals
of
her
priests
for
those
sins
and
scandals
would
have
destroyed
her
long
ago
if
christ
was
not
in
the
midst
to
save
and
sustain
her
just
as
the
ark
of
noah
was
miraculously
saved
by
the
mighty
hand
of
god
when
the
waters
of
the
deluge
would
otherwise
have
wrecked
it
so
our
holy
church
is
miraculously
prevented
from
perishing
in
the
flood
of
iniquities
by
which
too
many
priests
have
deluged
the
world
by
the
great
mercy
and
power
of
god
the
more
the
waters
of
the
deluge
were
flowing
on
the
earth
the
more
the
ark
was
raised
towards
heaven
by
these
very
waters
so
it
is
with
our
holy
church
the
very
sins
of
the
priests
make
that
spotless
spouse
of
jesus
christ
fly
away
higher
and
higher
towards
the
regions
of
holiness
as
it
is
in
god
let
therefore
your
faith
and
confidence
in
our
holy
church
and
your
respect
for
her
remain
firm
and
unshaken
in
the
midst
of
all
these
scandals
let
your
zeal
be
rekindled
for
her
glory
and
extension
at
the
sight
of
the
unfortunate
confreres
who
yield
to
the
attacks
of
the
enemy
just
as
the
valiant
soldier
makes
superhuman
efforts
to
save
the
flag
when
he
sees
those
who
carried
it
fall
on
the
oh
you
will
see
more
of
our
slaughtered
before
you
reach
my
age
but
be
not
disheartened
or
shaken
by
that
sad
spectacle
for
once
more
our
holy
church
will
stand
forever
in
spite
of
all
those
human
miseries
for
her
strength
and
her
infallibility
do
not
lie
in
men
but
in
jesus
christ
whose
promises
will
stand
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
hell
i
am
near
the
end
of
my
course
and
thanks
be
to
god
my
faith
in
our
holy
church
is
stronger
than
ever
though
i
have
seen
and
heard
many
things
compared
with
which
the
facts
which
just
now
distress
you
are
mere
trifles
in
order
the
better
to
inure
you
to
the
conflict
and
to
prepare
you
to
hear
and
see
more
deplorable
things
than
what
is
now
troubling
you
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
a
fact
which
i
got
from
the
late
lord
bishop
plessis
i
have
never
revealed
it
to
anybody
but
my
interest
in
you
is
so
great
that
i
will
tell
it
to
you
and
my
confidence
in
your
wisdom
is
so
absolute
that
i
am
sure
you
will
never
abuse
it
what
i
will
reveal
to
you
is
of
such
a
nature
that
we
must
keep
it
among
ourselves
and
never
let
it
be
known
to
the
people
for
it
would
diminish
if
not
destroy
their
respect
and
confidence
in
us
respect
and
confidence
without
which
it
would
become
almost
impossible
to
lead
them
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
late
venerable
bishop
plessis
was
my
personal
friend
our
intimacy
had
sprung
up
when
we
were
studying
under
the
same
roof
in
the
seminary
of
sulpice
montreal
and
it
had
increased
year
after
year
till
the
last
hour
of
his
life
every
summer
when
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
three
months
of
episcopal
visitation
of
his
diocese
he
used
to
come
and
spend
eight
or
ten
days
of
absolute
rest
and
enjoyment
of
private
and
solitary
life
with
me
in
this
parsonage
the
two
rooms
you
occupy
were
his
and
he
told
me
many
times
that
the
happiest
days
of
his
episcopal
life
were
those
passed
in
this
solitude
one
day
he
had
come
from
his
three
months
visit
more
worn
out
than
ever
and
when
i
sat
down
with
him
in
this
parlor
i
was
almost
frightened
by
the
air
of
distress
which
covered
his
face
instead
of
finding
him
the
loquacious
amiable
and
cheerful
guest
i
used
to
have
in
him
he
was
taciturn
cast
down
distressed
i
felt
really
uneasy
for
the
first
time
in
his
presence
but
as
it
was
the
last
hour
of
the
day
i
supposed
that
this
was
due
to
his
extreme
fatigue
and
i
hoped
that
the
rest
of
the
night
would
bring
about
such
a
change
in
my
venerable
friend
that
i
would
find
him
the
next
morning
what
he
used
to
be
the
most
amiable
and
interesting
of
men
i
was
myself
completely
worn
out
i
had
traveled
nearly
thirty
miles
that
day
to
go
to
receive
him
at
thomas
the
heat
was
oppressive
the
roads
very
bad
and
the
dust
awful
i
was
in
need
of
rest
and
i
was
hardly
in
my
bed
when
i
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
and
slept
till
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
was
then
suddenly
awakened
by
sobs
and
lamentations
and
prayers
which
were
evidently
coming
from
the
bishop
s
room
without
losing
a
moment
i
went
and
knocked
at
the
door
inquiring
about
the
cause
of
these
sobs
evidently
the
poor
bishop
had
not
suspected
that
i
could
hear
him
sobs
sobs
he
answered
what
do
you
mean
by
that
please
go
back
to
your
room
and
sleep
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
me
i
am
well
and
he
absolutely
refused
to
open
the
door
of
his
room
the
remaining
hours
of
the
night
of
course
were
sleepless
ones
for
me
the
sobs
of
the
bishop
were
more
suppressed
but
he
could
not
sufficiently
suppress
them
to
prevent
me
from
hearing
them
the
next
morning
his
eyes
were
reddened
with
weeping
and
his
face
was
that
of
one
who
had
suffered
intensely
all
the
night
after
breakfast
i
said
to
him
my
lord
last
night
has
been
one
of
desolation
to
your
lordship
for
god
s
sake
and
in
the
name
of
the
sacred
ties
of
friendship
which
has
united
us
during
so
many
years
please
tell
me
what
is
the
cause
of
your
sorrow
it
will
become
less
the
very
moment
you
share
it
with
your
the
bishop
answered
me
you
are
right
when
you
think
that
i
am
under
the
burden
of
a
great
desolation
but
its
cause
is
of
such
a
nature
that
i
can
not
reveal
it
even
to
you
my
dear
friend
it
is
only
at
the
feet
of
jesus
christ
and
his
holy
mother
that
i
must
go
to
unburden
my
heart
if
god
does
not
come
to
my
help
it
is
sure
that
i
must
die
from
it
but
i
will
carry
with
me
into
my
grave
the
awful
mystery
which
kills
in
vain
during
the
rest
of
the
day
i
did
all
that
i
could
to
persuade
monseigneur
plessis
to
reveal
the
cause
of
his
grief
i
failed
at
last
through
respect
for
him
i
withdrew
to
my
own
room
and
left
him
alone
knowing
that
solitude
is
sometimes
the
best
friend
of
a
desolated
mind
his
lordship
that
evening
withdrew
to
his
sleeping
room
sooner
than
usual
and
i
retired
to
my
room
much
later
but
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
for
me
that
night
for
his
desolation
seemed
to
be
so
great
and
his
tears
so
abundant
that
when
he
bade
me
good
night
i
was
in
fear
of
finding
my
venerable
and
more
than
ever
dear
friend
dead
in
his
bed
the
next
morning
i
watched
him
without
closing
my
eyes
from
the
adjoining
room
from
ten
o
clock
till
the
next
morning
though
it
was
evident
that
he
was
making
great
efforts
to
suppress
his
sobs
i
could
see
that
his
sorrow
was
still
more
intense
that
night
than
the
last
one
and
my
mental
agony
was
not
much
less
than
his
during
those
distressing
hours
but
i
formed
an
extreme
resolution
which
i
put
into
effect
the
very
moment
that
he
came
out
of
his
room
the
next
morning
to
salute
me
my
lord
said
i
i
thought
till
the
night
before
last
that
you
honored
me
with
your
friendship
but
i
see
that
i
was
mistaken
you
do
not
consider
me
as
your
friend
for
if
you
would
look
upon
me
as
a
friend
worthy
of
your
confidence
you
would
unburden
your
heart
unto
mine
a
true
friend
has
no
secret
from
a
true
friend
what
is
the
use
of
friendship
if
it
be
not
to
help
each
other
to
carry
the
burdens
of
life
i
found
myself
honored
by
your
presence
in
my
house
so
long
as
i
considered
myself
as
your
own
friend
but
now
that
i
see
i
have
lost
your
confidence
please
allow
me
frankly
to
say
to
your
lordship
that
i
do
not
feel
the
same
at
your
presence
here
besides
it
seems
to
me
very
probable
that
the
terrible
burden
which
you
want
to
carry
alone
will
kill
you
and
that
very
soon
and
i
do
not
at
all
like
the
idea
of
finding
you
suddenly
dead
in
my
parsonage
and
having
the
coroner
holding
his
inquest
on
your
body
and
making
the
painful
inquiries
which
are
always
made
upon
one
suddenly
taken
by
death
particularly
when
he
belongs
to
the
highest
ranks
of
society
then
my
lord
be
not
offended
if
i
respectfully
request
your
lordship
to
find
another
lodging
as
soon
as
my
words
fell
upon
the
bishop
like
a
thunderbolt
he
seemed
to
awaken
from
a
profound
sleep
with
a
deep
sigh
he
looked
in
my
face
with
his
eyes
rolling
in
tears
and
said
you
are
right
perras
i
ought
never
to
have
concealed
my
sorrow
from
such
a
friend
as
you
have
always
been
for
more
than
half
a
century
to
me
but
you
are
the
only
one
to
whom
i
can
reveal
it
no
doubt
your
priestly
and
christian
heart
will
not
be
less
broken
than
mine
but
you
will
help
me
with
your
prayers
and
wise
counsels
to
carry
it
however
before
i
initiate
you
into
such
an
awful
mystery
we
must
we
then
knelt
down
and
we
said
together
a
chaplet
to
invoke
the
power
of
the
virgin
mary
after
which
we
recited
psalm
li
misere
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
there
sitting
by
me
on
this
sofa
the
bishop
said
my
dear
perras
you
are
the
only
one
to
whom
i
could
reveal
what
you
are
about
to
hear
for
i
think
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
hear
such
a
terrible
secret
without
revealing
it
and
because
also
you
are
the
only
friend
whose
advice
can
guide
me
in
this
terrible
affliction
you
know
that
i
have
just
finished
the
visit
of
my
immense
diocese
of
quebec
it
has
taken
me
several
years
of
hard
work
and
fatigue
to
see
by
my
own
eyes
and
know
by
myself
the
gains
and
a
word
the
strength
and
life
of
our
holy
church
i
will
not
speak
to
you
of
the
people
they
are
as
a
general
thing
truly
religious
and
faithful
to
the
church
but
the
priests
o
great
god
will
i
tell
you
what
they
are
my
dear
perras
i
would
almost
die
with
joy
if
god
would
tell
me
that
i
am
mistaken
but
alas
i
am
not
mistaken
the
sad
the
terrible
truth
is
this
putting
his
right
hand
on
his
forehead
the
priests
ah
with
the
exception
of
you
and
three
others
are
infidels
and
atheists
o
my
god
my
god
what
will
become
of
the
church
in
the
hands
of
such
wicked
men
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
the
bishop
burst
into
tears
and
for
one
hour
could
not
say
a
word
i
myself
remained
mute
at
first
i
regretted
having
pressed
the
bishop
to
reveal
such
an
unexpected
mystery
of
iniquity
but
taking
counsel
of
our
very
fathomless
humiliation
and
distress
after
an
hour
of
silence
spent
in
pacing
the
walks
of
the
garden
almost
unable
to
look
each
other
in
the
face
i
said
my
lord
what
you
have
told
me
is
surely
the
saddest
thing
that
i
ever
heard
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
your
sorrows
are
out
of
the
limits
of
your
high
intelligence
and
your
profound
science
if
you
read
the
history
of
our
holy
church
from
the
seventh
to
the
fifteenth
century
you
will
know
that
the
spotless
spouse
of
christ
has
seen
as
dark
days
if
not
darker
in
italy
france
spain
and
germany
as
she
does
in
canada
and
though
the
saints
of
those
days
deplored
the
errors
and
crimes
of
those
dark
ages
they
have
not
killed
themselves
with
their
vain
tears
as
you
are
taking
the
bishop
by
the
hand
i
led
him
to
the
library
and
opened
the
pages
of
the
history
of
the
church
by
cardinals
baronius
and
henrion
i
showed
him
the
names
of
more
than
fifty
popes
who
had
evidently
been
atheists
and
infidels
i
read
to
him
the
lives
of
borgia
alexander
vi
and
a
dozen
others
who
would
surely
and
justly
be
hanged
by
the
executioner
of
quebec
were
they
in
that
city
committing
one
half
of
the
public
crimes
of
adultery
murder
debauchery
of
every
kind
which
they
committed
in
rome
avignon
naples
etc
i
read
to
him
some
of
the
public
and
undeniable
crimes
of
the
successors
of
the
apostles
and
of
the
inferior
clergy
and
i
easily
and
clearly
proved
to
him
that
his
priests
though
infidels
and
atheists
were
angels
of
pity
modesty
purity
and
religion
when
compared
with
a
borgia
who
publicly
lived
as
a
married
man
with
his
own
daughter
and
had
a
child
by
her
he
agreed
with
me
that
several
of
the
alexanders
the
johns
the
piuses
and
the
leos
were
sunk
much
deeper
in
the
abyss
of
every
kind
of
iniquity
than
his
priests
five
hours
passed
in
so
perusing
the
sad
but
irrefutable
pages
of
the
history
of
our
holy
church
wrought
a
marvelous
and
beneficial
change
in
the
mind
of
monseigneur
plessis
my
conclusion
was
that
if
our
holy
church
had
been
able
to
resist
the
deadly
influence
of
such
scandals
during
so
many
centuries
in
europe
she
would
not
be
destroyed
in
canada
even
by
the
legion
of
atheists
by
whom
she
is
served
the
bishop
acknowledged
that
my
conclusion
was
correct
he
thanked
me
for
the
good
i
had
done
him
by
preventing
him
from
despairing
of
the
future
of
our
holy
church
in
canada
and
the
rest
of
the
days
which
he
spent
with
me
he
was
almost
as
cheerful
and
amiable
as
before
now
my
dear
young
friend
added
perras
i
hope
you
will
be
as
reasonable
and
logical
in
your
religion
as
bishop
plessis
who
was
probably
the
greatest
man
canada
has
ever
had
when
satan
tries
to
shake
your
faith
by
the
scandals
you
see
remember
that
stephen
after
having
fought
with
his
adversary
pope
constantine
put
out
his
eyes
and
condemned
him
to
die
remember
that
other
pope
who
through
revenge
against
his
predecessor
had
him
exhumed
brought
his
dead
body
before
judges
then
charged
him
with
the
most
horrible
crimes
which
he
proved
by
the
testimony
of
scores
of
got
him
the
dead
pope
to
be
condemned
to
be
beheaded
and
dragged
with
ropes
through
the
muddy
streets
of
rome
and
thrown
into
the
river
tiber
yes
when
your
mind
is
oppressed
by
the
secret
crimes
of
the
priests
which
you
will
know
either
through
the
confessional
or
by
public
rumor
remember
that
more
than
twelve
popes
have
been
raised
to
that
high
and
holy
dignity
by
the
rich
and
influential
prostitutes
of
rome
with
whom
they
were
publicly
living
in
the
most
scandalous
way
remember
that
young
bastard
john
the
son
of
pope
sergius
who
was
consecrated
pope
when
only
twelve
years
old
by
the
influence
of
his
prostitute
mother
marosian
but
who
was
so
horribly
profligate
that
he
was
deposed
by
the
people
and
the
clergy
of
rome
well
if
our
holy
church
has
been
able
to
pass
through
such
storms
without
perishing
is
it
not
a
living
proof
that
christ
is
her
pilot
that
she
is
imperishable
and
infallible
because
peter
is
her
foundation
tu
es
petrus
et
super
hanc
petram
edificabo
ecclesiam
meam
et
portae
inferi
non
prevalebunt
adversus
oh
my
god
what
shall
i
confess
to
my
confusion
what
my
thoughts
were
during
that
conversation
or
rather
that
lecture
of
my
curate
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
yes
to
thy
eternal
glory
and
to
my
eternal
shame
i
must
say
the
truth
when
the
priest
was
exhibiting
to
me
the
horrible
unmentionable
crimes
of
so
many
of
our
popes
to
calm
my
fears
and
strengthen
my
shaken
faith
a
mysterious
voice
was
repeating
to
the
ears
of
my
soul
the
dear
saviour
s
words
a
good
tree
can
not
bring
forth
evil
fruit
neither
can
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit
every
tree
that
bringeth
not
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
and
in
spite
of
myself
the
voice
of
my
conscience
cried
in
thundering
tones
that
a
church
whose
head
and
members
were
so
horribly
corrupt
could
not
by
any
means
be
the
church
of
christ
but
the
most
sacred
and
imperative
law
of
my
church
which
i
had
promised
by
oaths
was
that
i
would
never
obey
the
voice
of
my
conscience
nor
follow
the
dictates
of
my
private
judgment
when
they
were
in
opposition
to
the
teachings
of
my
church
too
honest
to
admit
the
conclusions
of
perras
which
were
evidently
the
conclusions
of
my
church
i
was
too
cowardly
and
too
mean
to
bravely
express
my
own
mind
and
repeat
the
words
of
the
son
of
god
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
a
good
tree
can
not
bring
forth
evil
fruit
chapter
xx
papineau
and
the
patriots
in
burning
of
le
canadien
by
the
curate
of
charles
the
name
of
louis
joseph
papineau
will
be
forever
dear
to
the
french
canadians
for
whatever
may
be
the
political
party
to
which
one
belongs
in
canada
he
can
not
deny
that
it
is
to
the
ardent
patriotism
the
indomitable
energy
and
the
remarkable
eloquence
of
that
great
patriot
that
canada
is
indebted
for
the
greater
part
of
the
political
reforms
which
promise
in
a
near
future
to
raise
the
country
of
my
birth
to
the
rank
of
a
great
and
free
nation
it
is
not
my
intention
to
speak
of
the
political
parties
which
divided
the
people
of
canada
into
two
camps
in
the
long
and
trying
abuses
under
which
our
conquered
race
was
groaning
and
which
at
last
brought
about
the
bloody
insurrections
of
and
are
matters
of
history
which
do
not
pertain
to
the
plea
of
this
work
i
will
speak
of
papineau
and
the
brilliant
galaxy
of
talented
young
men
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
and
supported
only
in
connection
with
their
difficulties
with
the
clergy
and
the
church
of
rome
papineau
lefontaine
bedard
cartier
and
others
though
born
in
the
church
of
rome
were
only
nominal
romanists
i
have
been
personally
acquainted
with
every
one
of
them
and
i
know
they
were
not
in
the
habit
of
confessing
several
times
i
invited
them
to
fulfil
that
duty
which
i
considered
then
of
the
utmost
importance
to
be
saved
they
invariably
answered
me
with
jests
which
distressed
me
for
i
could
see
that
they
did
not
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
auricular
confession
these
men
were
honest
and
earnest
in
their
efforts
to
raise
their
countrymen
from
the
humiliating
and
inferior
position
which
they
occupied
compared
with
the
conquering
race
they
well
understood
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
in
order
to
put
the
french
canadians
on
a
level
with
their
british
compatriots
was
to
give
good
schools
to
the
people
and
they
bravely
set
themselves
to
show
the
necessity
of
having
a
good
system
of
education
for
the
country
as
well
as
for
the
city
but
at
the
very
first
attempt
they
found
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
their
patriotic
views
in
the
clergy
the
priests
had
everywhere
the
good
common
sense
to
understand
that
their
absolute
power
over
the
people
was
due
to
its
complete
ignorance
they
felt
that
that
power
would
decrease
in
the
same
proportion
that
light
and
education
would
spread
among
the
masses
hence
the
almost
insurmountable
obstacles
put
by
the
clergy
before
the
patriots
to
prevent
them
from
reforming
the
system
of
education
the
only
source
of
education
then
in
canada
with
the
exception
of
the
colleges
of
quebec
montreal
and
nicolet
consisted
in
one
or
two
schools
in
the
principal
parishes
entirely
under
the
control
of
the
priests
and
kept
by
their
most
devoted
servants
while
the
new
parishes
had
none
at
all
the
greater
part
of
these
teachers
knew
very
little
more
and
required
nothing
more
from
their
pupils
than
the
reading
of
the
a
b
c
and
their
little
catechism
when
once
admitted
to
the
first
communion
the
a
b
c
and
the
little
catechism
were
soon
forgotten
and
in
of
the
french
canadian
people
were
not
even
able
to
sign
their
names
in
many
parishes
the
curate
with
his
the
notary
and
a
of
others
were
the
only
persons
who
could
read
or
write
a
letter
papineau
and
his
patriotic
friends
understood
that
the
french
canadian
people
were
doomed
to
remain
an
inferior
race
in
their
own
country
if
they
were
left
in
that
shameful
state
of
ignorance
they
did
not
conceal
their
indignation
at
the
obstacles
placed
by
the
clergy
to
prevent
them
from
amending
the
system
of
education
several
eloquent
speeches
were
made
by
papineau
who
was
their
parliament
speaker
in
answer
to
the
clergy
the
curates
in
their
pulpits
as
well
as
by
the
press
tried
to
show
that
canada
had
the
best
possible
system
of
the
people
were
too
much
education
would
bring
into
canada
the
bitter
fruits
which
had
grown
in
france
revolution
riots
bloodshed
that
the
people
were
too
poor
to
pay
the
heavy
taxes
which
would
be
imposed
for
the
new
system
of
education
in
one
of
his
addresses
papineau
answered
this
last
argument
showing
the
immense
sums
of
money
foolishly
given
by
those
poor
people
to
gild
the
ceilings
of
the
church
as
was
the
usage
then
he
made
a
calculation
of
the
tithes
paid
to
the
priests
of
the
costly
images
and
statues
of
saints
which
were
to
be
seen
then
around
all
the
interior
of
the
churches
and
he
boldly
said
that
the
priests
would
do
better
to
induce
the
people
to
establish
good
schools
and
pay
respectable
teachers
than
to
lavish
their
money
on
objects
which
were
of
so
little
benefit
that
address
which
was
reproduced
by
the
only
french
paper
of
quebec
le
canadien
fell
upon
the
clergy
like
a
hurricane
upon
a
rotten
house
shaking
it
to
its
foundation
everywhere
papineau
and
his
party
were
denounced
as
infidels
more
dangerous
than
protestants
and
plans
were
immediately
laid
down
to
prevent
the
people
from
reading
le
canadien
the
only
french
paper
they
could
receive
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
were
receiving
it
in
charles
but
they
used
to
read
it
to
their
neighbors
who
gathered
on
sabbath
afternoons
to
hear
its
contents
we
at
first
tried
through
the
confessional
to
persuade
the
subscribers
to
reject
it
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
a
bad
paper
that
it
spoke
against
the
priests
and
would
finally
destroy
our
holy
religion
but
to
our
great
dismay
our
efforts
failed
the
curates
then
had
recourse
to
a
more
efficacious
way
of
preserving
the
faith
of
the
people
the
postmaster
of
charles
was
then
a
man
whom
perras
had
got
educated
at
his
own
expense
in
the
seminary
of
quebec
his
name
was
chabot
that
man
was
a
perfect
machine
in
the
hands
of
his
benefactor
perras
forbade
him
to
deliver
any
more
of
the
numbers
of
that
journal
to
the
subscribers
when
there
would
be
anything
unfavorable
to
the
clergy
in
its
columns
give
them
to
me
said
he
that
i
may
burn
them
and
when
the
people
come
to
get
them
give
them
such
evasive
answers
that
they
may
believe
that
it
is
the
editor
s
fault
or
of
some
other
if
they
have
not
received
from
that
day
every
time
there
was
any
censure
of
the
clergy
the
poor
paper
was
consigned
to
the
flames
one
evening
when
perras
had
in
my
presence
thrown
a
bundle
of
these
papers
into
the
stove
i
told
him
please
allow
me
to
express
to
you
my
surprise
at
this
act
have
we
really
the
right
to
deprive
the
subscribers
of
that
paper
of
their
property
that
paper
is
theirs
they
have
paid
for
it
how
can
we
take
upon
ourselves
to
destroy
it
without
their
permission
besides
you
know
the
old
proverb
pierres
stones
speak
if
it
were
known
by
our
people
that
we
destroy
their
papers
would
not
the
consequences
be
very
serious
now
perras
you
know
my
sincere
respect
for
you
and
i
hope
i
do
not
go
against
that
respect
by
asking
you
to
tell
me
by
what
right
or
authority
you
do
this
i
would
not
put
this
question
to
you
if
you
were
the
only
one
who
does
it
but
i
know
several
others
who
do
just
the
same
thing
i
will
probably
be
obliged
when
a
curate
to
act
in
the
same
manner
and
i
wish
to
know
on
what
grounds
i
shall
be
justified
in
acting
as
you
are
we
not
the
spiritual
fathers
of
our
people
answered
perras
i
replied
yes
sir
we
are
surely
the
spiritual
fathers
of
our
then
rejoined
perras
we
have
in
spiritual
matters
all
the
rights
and
duties
which
temporal
fathers
have
in
temporal
things
toward
their
children
if
a
father
sees
a
sharp
knife
in
the
hands
of
his
beloved
but
inexperienced
child
and
if
he
has
good
reasons
to
fear
that
the
dear
child
may
wound
himself
nay
destroy
his
own
life
with
that
knife
is
it
not
his
duty
before
god
and
man
to
take
it
from
his
hands
and
prevent
him
from
touching
it
any
more
yes
i
answered
but
allow
me
to
draw
your
attention
to
a
little
difference
which
i
see
between
the
corporal
and
the
spiritual
children
of
your
comparison
in
the
case
you
bring
forward
of
a
father
who
takes
away
the
knife
from
the
hands
of
a
young
and
inexperienced
child
that
knife
has
very
probably
been
bought
by
the
father
it
has
been
paid
for
with
that
father
s
money
it
is
then
the
father
s
knife
but
the
papers
of
your
spiritual
children
which
you
have
thrown
into
your
stove
have
been
paid
for
by
them
and
not
by
you
they
are
theirs
then
before
the
laws
of
god
and
man
and
they
are
not
i
saw
that
my
answer
had
cut
the
good
old
priest
to
the
quick
and
he
became
more
nervous
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
i
see
that
you
are
young
answered
he
you
have
not
yet
had
time
to
meditate
on
the
great
and
broad
principles
of
our
holy
church
i
confess
there
is
a
difference
in
the
rights
of
the
two
children
to
which
i
had
not
paid
attention
and
which
at
first
sight
may
seem
to
diminish
the
strength
of
my
argument
but
i
have
here
an
argument
which
will
satisfy
you
i
hope
some
weeks
ago
i
wrote
to
our
venerable
bishop
panet
about
my
intention
of
burning
that
miserable
and
impious
paper
le
canadien
to
prevent
it
from
poisoning
the
minds
of
our
people
against
us
and
he
has
approved
me
adding
the
advice
to
be
very
prudent
and
to
act
so
secretly
that
there
would
be
no
danger
in
being
detected
here
is
the
letter
of
the
holy
bishop
you
may
read
it
if
you
i
thank
you
i
replied
i
believe
that
what
you
say
in
reference
to
that
letter
is
correct
but
suppose
that
our
good
bishop
has
made
a
mistake
in
advising
you
to
burn
those
papers
would
you
not
have
some
reasons
to
regret
that
burning
should
you
sooner
or
later
detect
that
mistake
a
reason
of
regretting
to
follow
the
advice
of
my
superiors
never
never
i
fear
my
dear
young
friend
that
you
do
not
sufficiently
understand
the
duties
of
an
inferior
and
the
sacred
rights
of
superiors
in
our
holy
church
have
you
not
been
told
by
your
superiors
in
the
college
of
nicolet
that
there
can
be
no
sin
in
an
inferior
who
obeys
the
orders
or
counsels
of
his
legitimate
superiors
yes
sir
i
answered
the
rev
leprohon
has
told
us
that
in
the
college
of
but
rejoined
perras
your
last
question
makes
me
fear
that
you
have
forgotten
what
you
have
learned
there
my
dear
young
friend
do
not
forget
that
it
was
the
want
of
respect
to
their
ecclesiastical
superiors
which
caused
the
apostacy
of
luther
and
calvin
and
damned
so
many
millions
of
heretics
who
have
followed
them
but
in
order
to
bring
your
rebellious
mind
under
the
holy
yoke
of
a
perfect
submission
to
your
superiors
i
will
show
you
by
our
greatest
and
most
approved
theologian
that
i
can
burn
these
papers
without
doing
anything
wrong
before
he
then
went
to
his
library
and
brought
me
a
volume
of
liguori
from
which
he
read
to
me
the
following
latin
words
docet
sanchez
no
aliquem
occidere
licite
posse
suaderi
ut
ab
eo
furetur
vel
ut
fornicatur
page
it
is
allowed
to
commit
a
sin
of
a
lesser
degree
in
order
to
prevent
one
of
a
graver
with
an
air
of
triumph
he
said
do
you
see
now
that
i
am
absolutely
justifiable
in
destroying
these
pestilential
papers
according
to
those
principles
of
our
holy
church
you
know
well
that
even
a
woman
is
allowed
to
commit
the
sin
of
adultery
with
a
man
who
threatens
to
kill
her
or
himself
if
she
rebukes
him
because
murder
and
suicide
are
greater
crimes
and
more
irremediable
than
adultery
so
the
burning
of
those
papers
though
a
sin
if
done
through
malice
or
without
legitimate
reasons
ceases
to
be
a
sin
it
is
a
holy
action
the
moment
i
do
it
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
our
holy
religion
and
to
save
immortal
i
must
confess
to
my
shame
that
the
degrading
principles
of
absolute
submission
of
the
inferior
to
the
superiors
which
flattens
everything
to
the
ground
in
the
church
of
rome
had
so
completely
wrought
their
deadly
work
on
me
that
it
was
my
wish
to
attain
to
that
supreme
perfection
of
the
priest
of
the
church
of
rome
to
become
like
a
stick
in
the
hands
of
my
a
corpse
in
their
presence
but
my
god
was
stronger
than
his
unfaithful
and
blind
servant
and
he
never
allowed
me
to
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
that
abyss
of
folly
and
impiety
in
spite
of
myself
i
had
left
in
me
sufficient
manhood
to
express
my
doubts
about
that
awful
doctrine
of
my
church
i
do
not
want
to
revolt
against
my
superiors
i
answered
and
i
hope
god
will
prevent
me
from
falling
into
the
abyss
where
luther
and
calvin
lost
themselves
i
only
respectfully
request
you
to
tell
me
if
you
would
not
regret
the
burning
of
these
papers
in
case
you
would
know
that
bishop
panet
made
a
mistake
in
granting
you
the
power
of
destroying
a
property
which
is
neither
yours
nor
property
over
which
neither
of
you
has
any
control
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
was
not
entirely
of
the
same
mind
with
perras
till
then
i
had
not
been
brave
honest
or
independent
enough
to
oppose
his
views
and
his
though
often
tempted
to
do
so
the
desire
of
living
in
peace
with
him
the
sincere
respect
which
his
many
virtues
and
venerable
age
commanded
in
me
the
natural
timidity
not
to
say
cowardice
of
a
young
inexperienced
man
in
the
presence
of
a
learned
and
experienced
priest
had
kept
me
till
then
in
perfect
submission
to
the
views
of
my
aged
curate
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
yield
any
longer
and
to
bow
my
conscience
before
principles
which
seemed
to
me
then
as
i
am
sure
they
are
now
subversive
of
everything
which
is
good
and
holy
among
men
i
took
the
big
bible
which
was
on
the
table
and
i
opened
it
at
the
history
of
susanna
and
i
answered
my
dear
perras
god
has
chosen
you
to
be
my
teacher
and
i
have
learned
many
things
since
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
be
with
you
but
i
have
much
more
to
learn
before
i
know
all
that
your
books
and
your
long
experience
have
taught
you
i
hope
you
will
not
find
fault
with
me
if
i
honestly
tell
you
that
in
spite
of
myself
there
is
a
doubt
in
my
mind
about
this
doctrine
of
our
theologians
and
i
said
is
there
anything
more
sublime
in
the
whole
bible
than
that
feeble
woman
susanna
in
the
hands
of
those
two
infamous
men
with
a
diabolical
impudence
and
malice
they
threaten
to
destroy
her
and
to
take
her
before
a
tribunal
which
will
surely
condemn
her
to
the
most
ignoble
death
if
she
does
not
consent
to
satisfy
their
criminal
desires
she
is
just
in
the
position
alluded
to
by
liguori
what
will
she
do
will
she
be
guided
by
the
principles
of
our
theologians
will
she
consent
to
become
an
adulteress
in
order
to
prevent
those
two
men
from
perjuring
themselves
and
becoming
murderers
by
causing
her
to
be
stoned
to
death
as
was
required
by
the
law
of
the
jews
no
she
raises
her
eyes
and
her
soul
towards
the
god
whom
she
loves
and
fears
more
than
anything
in
the
world
and
she
says
i
am
straitened
on
every
side
for
if
i
do
this
thing
it
is
death
unto
me
and
if
i
do
it
not
i
can
not
escape
your
hands
it
is
better
for
me
to
fall
into
your
hands
and
not
to
do
it
than
to
sin
in
the
sight
of
the
has
not
god
almighty
himself
shown
that
he
approved
of
that
heroic
resolution
of
susanna
to
die
rather
than
commit
adultery
does
he
not
show
that
he
planted
himself
in
that
noble
soul
the
principle
that
it
is
better
to
die
than
break
the
laws
of
god
when
he
brought
his
prophet
daniel
and
gave
him
a
supernatural
wisdom
to
save
the
life
of
susanna
if
that
woman
had
been
guided
by
the
principles
of
ligouri
which
i
confess
to
you
with
regret
are
the
principles
accepted
everywhere
in
our
church
principles
which
have
guided
you
in
the
burning
of
le
canadien
she
would
have
consented
to
the
desires
of
those
infamous
men
nay
if
she
had
been
interrogated
by
her
husband
or
by
the
judges
on
that
action
she
would
have
been
allowed
to
swear
before
god
and
men
that
she
was
not
guilty
of
it
now
my
dear
perras
do
you
not
find
that
there
is
some
clashing
between
the
word
of
god
as
taught
in
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
teachings
of
our
church
through
the
theologians
never
have
i
seen
such
a
sudden
change
in
the
face
and
manners
of
a
man
at
i
saw
in
that
hour
that
perras
who
had
till
then
spoken
with
so
much
kindness
and
dignity
completely
lost
his
temper
instead
of
answering
me
he
abruptly
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
the
room
with
a
quick
step
after
some
time
he
told
me
mr
chiniquy
you
forget
that
when
you
were
ordained
a
priest
you
swore
that
you
would
never
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
according
to
your
own
fallible
private
judgment
you
solemnly
promised
that
you
would
take
them
only
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
speaking
to
you
through
your
superiors
has
not
ligouri
been
approved
by
the
popes
by
all
the
bishops
of
the
church
we
have
then
here
the
true
doctrine
which
must
guide
us
but
instead
of
submitting
yourself
with
humility
as
it
becomes
a
young
and
inexperienced
priest
you
boldly
appeal
to
the
scriptures
against
the
decisions
of
popes
and
bishops
against
the
voice
of
all
your
superiors
speaking
to
you
through
liguori
where
will
that
boldness
end
ah
i
tremble
for
you
if
you
do
not
speedily
change
you
are
on
the
high
road
to
heresy
these
last
words
had
hardly
fallen
from
his
lips
when
the
clock
struck
he
abruptly
stopped
speaking
and
said
this
is
the
hour
of
we
knelt
and
prayed
i
need
not
say
that
that
night
was
a
sleepless
one
to
me
i
wept
and
prayed
all
through
its
long
dark
hours
i
felt
that
i
had
lost
and
forever
the
high
position
i
had
in
the
heart
of
my
old
friend
and
that
i
had
probably
compromised
myself
forever
in
the
eyes
of
my
superiors
who
were
the
absolute
masters
of
my
destinies
i
condemned
myself
for
that
inopportune
appeal
to
the
holy
scriptures
against
the
of
my
superiors
i
asked
god
to
destroy
in
me
that
irresistible
tendency
by
which
i
was
constantly
going
to
the
word
of
god
to
know
the
truth
instead
of
remaining
at
the
feet
of
my
superiors
with
the
rest
of
the
clergy
as
the
only
fountain
of
knowledge
and
light
but
thanks
be
to
god
that
blasphemous
prayer
was
never
to
be
granted
chapter
xxi
grand
dinner
of
the
maniac
sister
of
rev
perras
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
in
the
church
of
rome
to
give
the
title
of
to
one
of
the
most
respectable
and
able
priests
among
twelve
or
fifteen
others
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
that
title
was
the
token
of
some
superior
power
which
was
granted
him
over
his
confreres
who
in
consequence
should
consult
him
in
certain
difficult
matters
as
a
general
thing
those
priests
lived
in
the
most
cordial
and
fraternal
unity
and
to
make
the
bond
of
that
union
stronger
and
more
pleasant
they
were
in
turn
in
the
habit
of
giving
a
grand
dinner
every
thursday
in
these
dinners
were
really
several
days
in
advance
preparations
were
made
on
a
grand
scale
to
collect
everything
that
could
please
the
tastes
of
the
guests
the
best
wines
were
purchased
the
fattest
turkeys
chickens
lambs
or
sucking
pigs
were
hunted
up
the
most
delicate
pastries
were
brought
from
the
city
or
made
at
home
at
any
cost
the
rarest
and
most
costly
fruits
and
desserts
were
ordered
there
was
a
strange
emulation
among
those
curates
who
would
surpass
his
neighbors
several
extra
hands
were
engaged
some
days
before
to
help
the
ordinary
servants
to
prepare
the
grand
the
second
thursday
of
may
was
perras
turn
and
at
twelve
o
clock
noon
we
were
fifteen
priests
seated
around
the
table
illustration
grand
dinner
of
the
priests
i
must
here
render
homage
to
the
sobriety
and
perfect
moral
habits
of
the
rev
perras
though
he
took
his
social
glass
of
wine
as
was
the
universal
usage
at
that
time
i
never
saw
him
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
glasses
at
the
same
meal
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
thing
of
all
those
who
were
at
this
table
that
day
never
did
i
see
before
nor
after
a
table
covered
with
so
many
tempting
and
delicate
viands
the
good
curate
had
surpassed
himself
and
i
would
hardly
be
believed
were
i
to
give
the
number
of
dishes
and
covers
et
which
loaded
the
table
i
will
only
mention
a
splendid
salmon
which
was
the
first
brought
to
quebec
that
year
for
which
amiot
the
purveyor
of
the
priests
around
the
capital
had
paid
twelve
dollars
there
was
only
one
lady
at
that
dinner
miss
perras
sister
of
the
curate
however
she
was
not
at
all
embarrassed
by
finding
herself
alone
among
those
jolly
celebataires
and
she
looked
like
a
queen
at
the
head
of
the
table
her
sweet
and
watchful
eyes
were
everywhere
to
see
the
wants
of
her
guests
she
had
an
amiable
word
for
every
one
of
them
with
the
utmost
grace
she
pressed
the
rev
to
try
that
wing
of
was
so
gently
remonstrating
with
the
rev
for
his
not
eating
more
and
she
was
so
eloquent
in
requesting
them
all
to
taste
of
this
dish
or
of
that
which
was
quite
a
new
thing
in
canada
and
her
young
chickens
who
could
refuse
to
accept
one
of
them
after
she
had
told
their
story
how
three
months
before
in
view
of
this
happy
day
she
had
so
cajoled
the
big
black
hen
to
watch
over
sixteen
eggs
in
the
kitchen
what
a
world
of
trouble
she
had
when
the
little
dog
was
coming
in
and
she
the
hen
was
rushing
at
him
how
many
times
she
had
to
stop
the
combatants
and
force
them
to
live
in
peace
and
what
desolation
swept
over
her
mind
when
in
a
dark
night
the
rats
had
dragged
into
their
holes
three
of
her
chickens
how
she
had
got
a
cat
to
destroy
the
rats
and
how
in
escaping
scylla
she
was
thrown
upon
charybdis
when
three
days
after
the
cat
made
his
dinner
of
two
of
her
dear
little
chickens
for
which
crime
committed
in
open
day
before
several
witnesses
the
sentence
of
death
was
passed
and
executed
without
benefit
of
clergy
now
where
would
they
find
young
chickens
in
the
month
of
may
in
the
neighborhood
of
quebec
when
the
snow
had
scarcely
disappeared
these
stories
given
with
an
art
which
no
pen
can
reproduce
were
not
finished
before
the
delicate
chickens
had
disappeared
in
the
hungry
mouths
of
the
cheerful
guests
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
these
dinners
was
the
levity
the
absolute
want
of
seriousness
and
gravity
not
a
word
was
said
in
my
presence
there
which
could
indicate
that
these
men
had
anything
else
to
do
in
this
world
but
to
eat
and
drink
tell
and
hear
merry
stories
laugh
and
lead
a
jolly
life
i
was
the
youngest
of
those
priests
only
a
few
months
before
i
was
in
the
seminary
of
nicolet
learning
from
my
grave
old
superior
lessons
of
priestly
life
very
different
from
what
i
had
there
under
my
eyes
i
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
austere
preaching
of
mortification
austerity
and
crucifixion
of
the
flesh
which
were
to
fill
up
the
days
of
a
priest
though
at
first
i
was
pleased
with
all
i
saw
heard
and
tasted
though
i
heartily
laughed
with
the
rest
of
the
guests
at
their
their
spicy
stories
about
their
fair
penitents
or
at
the
funny
caricatures
they
drew
of
each
other
as
well
as
of
absent
ones
i
felt
by
turns
uneasy
now
and
then
the
lessons
of
priestly
life
received
from
the
lips
of
my
venerable
and
dear
leprohon
were
knocking
hard
at
the
door
of
my
conscience
some
words
of
the
holy
scriptures
which
more
than
others
had
adhered
to
my
memory
were
also
making
a
strange
noise
in
my
soul
my
own
common
sense
was
telling
me
that
this
was
not
quite
the
way
christ
taught
his
disciples
to
live
i
made
a
great
effort
to
stifle
those
troublesome
voices
sometimes
i
succeeded
and
then
i
became
cheerful
but
a
moment
after
i
was
overpowered
by
them
and
i
felt
chilled
as
if
i
had
perceived
on
the
walls
of
the
festive
room
the
finger
of
my
angry
god
writing
mene
mene
tekel
then
all
my
cheerfulness
vanished
and
i
felt
so
miserable
that
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
to
look
happy
the
rev
paquette
curate
of
gervais
observed
it
on
my
face
that
priest
was
probably
the
one
who
most
enjoyed
everything
of
that
feast
under
the
snowy
mantle
of
years
he
had
kept
the
warm
heart
and
the
joviality
of
youth
he
was
considered
one
of
our
most
wealthy
curates
and
he
richly
deserved
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
epicurean
of
them
all
he
was
a
perfect
cook
and
with
his
chaplet
or
his
breviarium
in
hand
he
used
to
pass
a
great
part
of
the
day
in
his
kitchen
giving
orders
about
broiling
this
beefstake
or
preparing
this
fricassee
and
that
gravy
la
he
was
loved
by
all
his
confreres
but
particularly
by
the
young
priests
who
were
the
objects
of
his
constant
attentions
he
had
always
been
exceedingly
kind
to
me
and
when
in
his
neighborhood
i
dare
say
that
my
most
pleasant
hours
were
those
passed
in
his
parsonage
looking
at
me
in
the
very
moment
when
my
whole
intellectual
being
was
in
spite
of
myself
under
the
darkest
cloud
he
said
my
dear
little
father
chiniquy
are
you
falling
into
the
hands
of
some
blue
devils
when
we
are
all
so
happy
you
were
so
cheerful
half
an
hour
ago
what
is
the
matter
with
you
now
are
you
sick
you
look
as
grave
and
anxious
as
jonah
when
in
the
big
whale
s
stomach
what
is
the
matter
with
you
has
any
of
your
fair
penitents
left
you
to
go
to
confess
to
another
lately
at
these
funny
questions
the
was
shaken
with
the
convulsive
laughter
of
the
priests
i
wished
i
could
join
in
with
the
rest
of
my
confreres
for
it
seemed
to
me
very
clear
that
i
was
making
a
fool
of
myself
by
this
singularity
of
demeanor
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
for
a
moment
before
i
had
seen
that
the
servant
girls
had
blushed
they
had
been
scandalized
by
a
very
improper
word
from
the
lips
of
a
young
priest
about
one
of
his
young
female
penitents
a
word
which
he
would
surely
never
have
uttered
had
he
not
drank
too
much
wine
i
answered
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
interest
i
find
myself
much
honored
to
be
here
in
your
midst
but
as
the
brightest
days
are
not
without
clouds
so
it
is
with
us
all
sometimes
i
am
young
and
without
experience
i
have
not
yet
learned
to
look
at
certain
things
in
their
proper
light
when
older
i
hope
i
shall
be
wiser
and
not
make
an
ass
of
myself
as
i
do
tah
tah
tah
said
old
paquette
this
is
not
the
hour
of
dark
clouds
and
blue
devils
be
cheerful
as
it
behooves
your
age
there
will
be
hours
enough
in
the
rest
of
your
life
for
sadness
and
sombre
thoughts
this
is
the
hour
for
laughing
and
being
merry
sad
thoughts
for
and
appealing
to
all
he
asked
is
not
this
correct
gentlemen
yes
yes
unanimously
rejoined
all
the
guests
now
said
the
old
priest
you
see
that
the
verdict
of
the
jury
is
unanimously
in
my
favor
and
against
you
give
up
those
airs
of
sadness
which
do
not
answer
in
the
presence
of
those
bottles
of
champagne
your
gravity
is
an
anachronism
when
we
have
such
good
wines
before
us
tell
me
the
reason
of
your
grief
and
i
pledge
myself
to
console
you
and
make
you
happy
as
you
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
i
would
have
liked
better
that
you
should
have
continued
to
enjoy
this
pleasant
hour
without
noticing
me
i
answered
please
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
trouble
you
with
the
causes
of
my
personal
well
well
said
paquette
i
see
it
the
cause
of
your
trouble
is
that
we
have
not
yet
drank
together
a
single
glass
of
sherry
fill
your
glass
with
that
wine
and
it
will
surely
drown
the
blue
devil
which
i
see
at
its
with
pleasure
i
said
i
feel
much
honored
to
drink
with
you
and
i
put
some
drops
of
wine
into
my
glass
oh
oh
what
do
i
see
you
doing
there
only
a
few
drops
in
your
glass
this
will
not
even
wet
the
cloven
feet
of
the
blue
devil
which
is
tormenting
you
it
requires
a
full
glass
an
overflowing
glass
to
drown
and
finish
him
fill
then
your
glass
with
that
precious
best
i
ever
tasted
in
my
whole
but
i
can
not
drink
more
than
those
few
drops
i
said
why
not
he
replied
because
eight
days
before
her
death
my
mother
wrote
me
a
letter
requesting
me
to
promise
her
that
i
would
never
drink
more
than
two
glasses
of
wine
at
the
same
meal
i
gave
her
that
promise
in
my
answer
and
the
very
day
she
got
my
pledge
she
left
this
world
to
convey
it
written
on
her
heart
into
heaven
to
the
feet
of
her
god
keep
that
sacred
pledge
answered
the
old
curate
but
tell
me
why
you
are
so
sad
when
we
are
so
happy
you
already
know
part
of
my
i
had
drank
as
much
wine
as
my
neighbor
the
vicar
of
gervais
i
would
probably
have
filled
the
room
with
my
shouts
of
joy
as
he
does
but
you
see
now
that
the
hands
of
my
deceased
though
always
dear
mother
are
on
my
glass
to
prevent
me
from
filling
it
any
more
for
i
have
already
drank
two
glasses
of
but
your
sadness
in
such
a
circumstance
is
so
strange
that
we
would
all
like
to
know
its
yes
yes
said
all
the
priests
you
know
that
we
like
you
and
we
deeply
feel
for
you
please
tell
us
the
reason
of
this
i
then
answered
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
keep
my
own
secret
for
i
know
i
will
make
a
fool
of
myself
here
but
as
you
are
unanimous
in
requesting
me
to
give
you
the
reasons
of
the
mental
agony
through
which
i
am
just
passing
you
will
have
them
you
well
know
that
through
very
singular
circumstances
i
have
been
prevented
till
this
day
from
attending
any
of
your
grand
dinners
twice
i
had
to
go
to
quebec
on
these
occasions
sometimes
i
was
not
well
enough
to
be
times
i
was
called
to
visit
some
dying
person
and
at
other
times
the
weather
or
the
roads
were
too
bad
to
travel
this
then
is
the
first
grand
dinner
attended
by
you
all
that
i
have
the
honor
of
attending
but
before
going
any
further
i
must
tell
you
that
during
the
eight
months
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
sit
at
rev
perras
table
i
have
never
seen
anything
which
could
make
me
suspect
that
my
eyes
would
see
and
my
ears
would
hear
such
things
in
this
parsonage
as
have
just
taken
place
sobriety
moderation
truly
evangelical
temperance
in
drink
and
food
were
the
invariable
rule
never
a
word
was
said
which
could
make
our
poor
servant
girls
or
the
angels
of
god
blush
would
to
god
that
i
had
not
been
here
for
i
tell
you
honestly
that
i
am
scandalized
by
the
epicurean
table
which
is
before
us
by
the
enormous
quantity
of
delicate
viands
and
the
incredible
number
of
bottles
of
most
costly
wines
emptied
at
this
dinner
however
i
hope
i
am
mistaken
in
my
appreciation
of
what
i
have
seen
and
hope
you
are
all
right
and
that
i
am
wrong
i
am
the
youngest
of
you
all
it
is
not
my
business
to
teach
you
but
it
is
my
duty
to
be
taught
by
you
now
i
have
given
you
my
mind
because
you
so
pressingly
requested
me
to
do
it
as
honestly
as
human
language
will
allow
me
to
do
i
have
the
right
i
hope
to
request
you
to
tell
me
as
honestly
if
i
am
and
in
what
i
am
wrong
or
right
oh
ho
my
dear
chiniquy
replied
the
old
curate
you
hold
the
stick
by
the
wrong
end
are
we
not
the
children
of
god
yes
sir
i
answered
we
are
the
children
of
now
does
not
a
loving
father
give
what
he
considers
the
best
part
of
his
goods
to
his
beloved
children
yes
sir
i
replied
is
not
that
loving
father
pleased
when
he
sees
his
beloved
children
eat
and
drink
the
good
things
he
has
prepared
for
them
yes
sir
was
my
answer
then
rejoined
the
logical
priest
the
more
we
the
beloved
children
of
god
eat
of
these
delicate
viands
and
drink
of
those
precious
wines
which
our
heavenly
father
puts
into
our
hands
the
more
he
is
pleased
with
us
the
more
we
the
most
beloved
ones
of
god
are
merry
and
cheerful
the
more
he
is
himself
pleased
and
rejoiced
in
his
heavenly
kingdom
but
if
god
our
father
is
so
pleased
with
what
we
have
eaten
and
drunk
why
are
you
so
sad
this
masterpiece
of
argumentation
was
received
by
all
except
perras
with
convulsive
cries
of
approbation
and
repeated
bravo
bravo
i
was
too
mean
and
cowardly
to
say
what
i
felt
i
tried
to
conceal
my
increased
sadness
under
the
forced
smiles
of
my
lips
and
i
followed
the
whole
party
who
left
the
table
and
went
to
the
parlor
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
it
was
then
one
at
two
o
clock
the
whole
party
went
to
the
church
where
after
kneeling
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
their
wafer
god
they
fell
on
their
knees
at
the
feet
of
each
other
to
confess
their
sins
and
get
their
pardon
in
the
absolution
of
their
confessors
at
three
they
were
all
gone
and
i
remained
alone
with
my
venerable
old
curate
perras
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
i
said
to
him
my
dear
perras
i
have
no
words
to
express
to
you
my
regret
for
what
i
have
said
at
your
table
i
beg
your
pardon
for
every
word
of
that
unfortunate
and
unbecoming
conversation
into
which
i
was
dragged
in
spite
of
myself
you
know
it
it
does
not
do
for
a
young
priest
as
i
am
to
criticise
those
whom
god
has
put
so
much
above
him
by
their
science
their
age
and
their
virtues
but
i
was
forced
to
give
my
mind
and
i
have
given
it
when
i
requested
paquette
to
tell
me
in
what
i
might
be
wrong
i
had
not
the
least
idea
that
we
would
hear
from
the
lips
of
one
of
our
veterans
in
the
priesthood
the
blasphemous
jokes
he
has
uttered
epicurus
himself
would
have
blushed
had
he
been
among
us
in
hearing
the
name
of
god
connected
with
such
deplorable
and
awful
perras
answered
me
far
from
being
displeased
with
what
i
have
heard
from
you
at
this
dinner
i
must
tell
you
that
you
have
gained
much
in
my
esteem
by
it
i
am
myself
ashamed
of
that
dinner
we
priests
are
the
victims
like
the
rest
of
the
world
of
the
fashions
vanities
pride
and
lust
of
that
world
against
which
we
are
sent
to
preach
the
expenditure
we
make
at
those
dinners
is
surely
a
crime
in
the
face
of
the
misery
of
the
people
by
whom
we
are
surrounded
this
is
the
last
dinner
i
give
with
such
foolish
extravagance
the
next
time
my
neighbors
will
meet
here
i
will
not
expose
them
to
stagger
on
their
legs
as
the
greater
part
of
them
did
when
they
rose
from
the
table
the
brave
words
you
have
uttered
have
done
me
good
they
will
do
them
good
also
for
though
they
had
all
eaten
and
drunk
too
much
they
were
not
so
intoxicated
as
not
to
remember
what
you
have
then
pressing
my
hand
in
his
he
said
i
thank
you
my
good
little
father
chiniquy
for
the
short
but
excellent
sermon
you
have
given
us
it
will
not
be
lost
you
have
drawn
my
tears
when
you
have
shown
us
your
saintly
mother
going
to
the
feet
of
god
in
heaven
with
your
sacred
promise
written
in
her
heart
oh
you
must
have
had
a
good
mother
i
knew
her
when
she
was
very
young
she
was
then
already
a
very
remarkable
girl
for
her
wisdom
and
the
dignity
of
her
then
he
left
me
alone
in
the
parlor
and
he
went
to
visit
a
sick
man
in
one
of
the
neighboring
houses
when
alone
i
fell
on
my
knees
to
pray
and
weep
my
soul
was
filled
with
emotions
which
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
remembrance
of
my
beloved
mother
whose
blessed
name
had
fallen
from
my
lips
when
her
sacred
memory
filled
my
mind
with
the
light
and
strength
i
needed
in
that
hour
of
gluttony
and
drunkenness
of
those
priests
whom
i
was
accustomed
to
respect
and
esteem
so
scandalous
lewd
more
than
all
their
confessions
to
each
other
after
two
such
hours
of
profanity
and
drinking
were
more
than
i
could
endure
i
could
not
contain
myself
i
wept
over
myself
for
i
felt
also
the
burden
of
my
sins
and
i
did
not
find
myself
much
better
than
the
rest
though
i
had
not
eaten
or
drunk
quite
so
much
as
several
of
wept
over
my
friends
whom
i
had
seen
so
weak
for
they
were
my
friends
i
loved
them
and
i
know
they
loved
me
i
wept
over
my
church
which
was
served
by
such
poor
sinful
priests
yes
i
wept
there
when
on
my
knees
to
my
heart
s
content
and
it
did
me
good
but
my
god
had
another
trial
in
store
for
his
poor
unfaithful
servant
i
had
not
been
ten
minutes
alone
sitting
in
my
study
when
i
heard
strange
cries
and
such
a
noise
as
if
a
murderer
were
at
work
to
strike
his
victim
a
door
had
evidently
been
broken
open
up
stairs
and
some
one
was
running
down
stairs
as
if
one
was
wanting
to
break
down
everything
the
cries
of
murder
murder
reached
my
ears
and
the
cries
of
oh
my
god
my
god
where
is
perras
filled
the
air
i
quickly
ran
to
the
parlor
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
there
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
a
woman
absolutely
naked
her
long
black
hair
was
flowing
on
her
shoulders
her
face
was
pale
as
dark
eyes
fixed
in
their
sockets
she
stretched
her
hands
toward
me
with
a
horrible
shriek
and
before
i
could
move
a
step
terrified
and
almost
paralyzed
as
i
was
she
seized
my
two
arms
with
her
hands
with
such
a
terrible
force
as
if
my
arms
had
been
grasped
in
a
vise
my
bones
were
cracking
under
her
grasp
and
my
flesh
was
torn
by
her
nails
i
tried
to
escape
but
it
was
impossible
i
soon
found
myself
as
if
nailed
to
the
wall
unable
to
move
any
further
i
cried
then
to
the
utmost
compass
of
my
voice
for
help
but
the
living
spectre
cried
still
louder
you
have
nothing
to
fear
be
quiet
i
am
sent
by
god
almighty
and
the
blessed
virgin
mary
to
give
you
a
message
the
priests
whom
i
have
known
without
a
single
exception
are
a
band
of
vipers
they
destroy
their
female
penitents
through
auricular
confession
they
have
destroyed
me
and
killed
my
female
child
do
not
follow
their
example
then
she
began
to
sing
with
a
beautiful
voice
to
a
most
touching
tune
a
kind
of
poem
she
had
composed
herself
which
i
secretly
got
afterward
from
one
of
her
servant
maids
the
translation
of
which
is
as
follows
satan
s
priests
have
defiled
my
heart
damned
my
soul
murdered
my
child
o
my
child
my
darling
child
from
thy
place
in
heaven
dost
thou
see
thy
guilty
mother
s
tears
canst
thou
come
and
press
me
in
thine
arms
my
child
my
darling
child
will
never
thy
smiling
face
console
me
when
she
was
singing
these
words
big
tears
were
rolling
down
her
pale
cheeks
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
so
sad
that
she
could
have
melted
a
heart
of
stone
she
had
not
finished
her
song
when
i
cried
to
the
girl
i
am
fainting
for
god
s
sake
bring
me
some
water
the
water
was
only
passed
to
my
lips
i
could
not
drink
i
was
choked
and
petrified
in
the
presence
of
that
living
phantom
i
could
not
dare
to
touch
her
in
any
way
with
my
hands
i
felt
horrified
and
paralyzed
at
the
sight
of
that
livid
pale
cadaverous
naked
spectre
the
poor
servant
girl
had
tried
in
vain
at
my
request
to
drag
her
away
from
me
she
had
struck
her
with
terror
by
crying
if
you
touch
me
i
will
instantly
strangle
you
where
is
perras
where
is
perras
and
the
other
servants
for
god
s
sake
call
them
i
cried
out
to
the
servant
girl
who
was
trembling
and
beside
herself
miss
perras
is
running
to
the
church
after
the
curate
she
answered
and
i
do
not
know
where
the
other
girl
is
in
that
instant
perras
entered
rushed
toward
his
sister
and
said
are
you
not
ashamed
to
present
yourself
naked
before
such
a
gentleman
and
with
his
strong
arms
he
tried
to
force
her
to
give
me
up
turning
her
face
towards
him
with
tigress
eyes
she
cried
out
wretched
brother
what
have
you
done
with
my
child
i
see
her
blood
on
your
hands
when
she
was
struggling
with
her
brother
i
made
a
sudden
and
extreme
effort
to
get
out
of
her
grasp
and
this
time
i
succeeded
but
seeing
that
she
wanted
to
throw
herself
again
upon
me
i
jumped
through
a
window
which
was
opened
quick
as
lightning
she
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
her
brother
and
jumped
also
through
the
window
to
run
after
me
she
would
surely
have
overtaken
me
for
i
had
not
run
two
rods
when
i
fell
headlong
with
my
feet
entangled
in
my
long
black
priestly
robe
providentially
two
strong
men
attracted
by
my
cries
came
to
my
rescue
they
wrapped
her
in
a
blanket
taken
there
by
her
sister
and
brought
her
back
into
the
upper
chambers
where
she
remained
safely
locked
under
the
guard
of
two
strong
servant
maids
the
history
of
that
woman
is
sad
indeed
when
in
her
s
house
when
young
and
of
great
beauty
she
was
seduced
by
her
father
confessor
and
became
mother
of
a
female
child
which
she
loved
with
a
real
mother
s
heart
she
determined
to
keep
it
and
bring
it
up
but
this
did
not
meet
the
views
of
the
curate
one
night
while
the
mother
was
sleeping
the
child
had
been
taken
away
from
her
the
awakening
of
the
unfortunate
mother
was
terrible
when
she
understood
that
she
could
never
see
her
child
any
more
she
filled
the
parsonage
with
her
cries
and
lamentations
and
at
first
refused
to
take
any
food
in
order
that
she
might
die
but
she
soon
became
a
maniac
perras
too
much
attached
to
his
sister
to
send
her
to
a
lunatic
asylum
resolved
to
keep
her
in
his
own
parsonage
which
was
very
large
a
room
in
its
upper
part
had
been
fixed
in
such
a
way
that
her
cries
could
not
be
heard
and
where
she
would
have
all
the
comfort
possible
in
her
sad
circumstances
two
servant
maids
were
engaged
to
take
care
of
her
all
this
was
so
well
arranged
that
i
had
been
eight
months
in
that
parsonage
without
even
suspecting
that
there
was
such
an
unfortunate
being
under
the
same
roof
with
me
it
appears
that
occasionally
for
many
days
her
mind
was
perfectly
lucid
when
she
passed
her
time
in
praying
and
singing
a
kind
of
poem
which
she
had
composed
herself
and
which
she
sang
while
holding
me
in
her
grasp
in
her
best
moments
she
had
fostered
an
invincible
hatred
for
the
priests
whom
she
had
known
hearing
her
attendants
often
speak
of
me
she
had
several
times
expressed
a
desire
to
see
me
which
of
course
had
been
denied
her
before
she
had
broken
her
door
and
escaped
from
the
hands
of
her
keeper
she
had
passed
several
days
in
saying
that
she
had
received
from
god
a
message
for
me
which
she
would
deliver
even
if
she
had
to
pass
on
the
dead
bodies
of
all
in
the
house
unfortunate
victim
of
auricular
confession

many
others
could

am
appointed
vicar
of
the
curate
of
piety
lives
and
deaths
of
fathers
bedard
and
perras
the
grand
dinner
previously
described
had
its
natural
results
several
of
the
guests
were
hardly
at
home
when
they
complained
of
various
kinds
of
sickness
and
none
was
so
severely
punished
as
my
friend
paquette
the
curate
of
gervais
he
came
very
near
dying
and
for
several
weeks
was
unable
to
work
he
requested
the
bishop
of
quebec
to
allow
me
to
go
to
his
help
which
i
did
to
the
end
of
may
when
i
received
the
following
letter
charlesbourgh
may
rev
chiniquy
my
dear
sir
my
lord
panet
has
again
chosen
me
this
year
to
accompany
him
in
his
episcopal
visit
i
have
consented
with
the
condition
that
you
should
take
my
place
at
the
head
of
my
dear
parish
during
my
absence
for
i
will
have
no
anxiety
when
i
know
that
my
people
are
in
the
hands
of
a
priest
who
though
so
young
has
raised
himself
so
high
in
the
esteem
of
all
those
who
know
him
please
come
as
soon
as
possible
to
meet
me
here
that
i
may
tell
you
many
things
which
will
make
your
ministry
more
easy
and
blessed
in
charlesbourgh
his
lordship
has
promised
me
that
when
you
pass
through
quebec
he
will
give
you
all
the
powers
you
want
to
administer
my
parish
as
if
you
were
its
curate
during
my
absence
your
devoted
and
friend
in
the
love
and
heart
of
jesus
and
mary
antoine
bedard
i
felt
absolutely
confounded
by
that
letter
i
was
so
young
and
so
deficient
in
the
qualities
required
for
the
high
position
to
which
i
was
so
unexpectedly
called
i
know
it
was
against
the
usages
to
put
a
young
and
untried
priest
in
such
a
responsible
post
it
seemed
evident
to
me
that
my
friends
and
my
superiors
had
strangely
exaggerated
to
themselves
my
feeble
capacity
in
my
answer
to
the
rev
bedard
i
respectfully
remonstrated
against
such
a
choice
but
a
letter
received
from
the
bishop
himself
ordering
me
to
go
to
charlesbourgh
without
delay
to
administer
that
parish
during
the
absence
of
its
pastor
soon
forced
me
to
consider
that
sudden
and
unmerited
elevation
as
a
most
dangerous
though
providential
trial
of
my
young
ministry
nothing
remained
to
be
done
by
me
but
to
accept
the
task
in
trembling
and
with
a
desire
to
do
my
duty
my
heart
however
fainted
within
me
and
i
shed
bitter
tears
of
anxiety
when
entering
into
that
parish
for
the
first
time
i
saw
its
magnitude
and
importance
it
seemed
then
more
than
ever
evident
to
me
that
the
good
bedard
and
my
venerable
superiors
had
made
a
sad
mistake
in
putting
such
a
heavy
burden
on
my
young
and
feeble
shoulders
i
was
hardly
years
old
and
had
not
more
than
nine
months
experience
of
the
ministry
charlesbourgh
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
important
parishes
of
canada
its
position
so
near
quebec
at
the
feet
of
the
laurentide
mountains
is
peculiarly
beautiful
it
has
an
almost
complete
command
of
the
city
and
of
its
magnificent
port
where
not
less
than
ships
then
received
their
precious
cargoes
of
lumber
on
our
left
numberless
ranges
of
white
houses
extended
as
far
as
the
falls
of
montmorency
at
our
feet
the
majestic
lawrence
dashing
its
rapid
waters
on
the
beautiful
isle
d
to
the
right
the
parishes
of
lorette
foy
roch
with
their
high
church
steeples
reflected
the
sun
s
glorious
beams
and
beyond
the
impregnable
citadel
of
quebec
with
its
tortuous
ranges
of
black
walls
its
numerous
cannon
and
its
high
towers
like
fearless
sentinels
presented
a
spectacle
of
remarkable
grandeur
the
rev
bedard
welcomed
me
on
my
arrival
with
words
of
such
kindness
that
my
heart
was
melted
and
my
mind
confounded
he
was
a
man
about
years
of
age
short
in
stature
with
a
breast
large
shoulders
bright
eyes
and
a
face
where
the
traits
of
indomitable
energy
were
coupled
with
an
expression
of
unsurpassed
kindness
one
could
not
look
on
that
honest
face
without
saying
to
himself
i
am
with
a
really
good
and
upright
man
bedard
is
one
of
the
few
priests
in
whom
i
have
found
a
true
honest
faith
in
the
church
of
rome
with
an
irreproachable
character
he
believed
with
a
child
s
faith
all
the
absurdities
which
the
church
of
rome
teaches
and
he
lived
according
to
his
honest
and
sincere
faith
though
the
actions
of
our
daily
lives
were
not
subjected
to
a
regular
and
inexorable
rule
in
charlesbourgh
s
as
in
charles
parsonage
there
was
yet
far
more
life
and
earnestness
in
the
performance
of
our
ministerial
duties
there
was
less
reading
of
learned
theological
philosophical
and
historical
books
but
much
more
real
labor
in
bedard
s
than
in
perras
parish
there
was
more
of
the
old
french
aristocracy
in
the
latter
priest
and
more
of
the
good
religious
canadian
habitant
in
the
former
though
both
could
be
considered
as
men
of
the
most
exalted
faith
and
piety
in
the
church
of
rome
their
piety
was
of
a
different
character
in
perras
religion
there
was
real
calmness
and
serenity
while
the
religion
of
bedard
had
more
of
a
flash
of
lightning
and
the
noise
of
thunder
the
private
religious
conversations
with
the
curate
of
charles
were
admirable
but
he
could
not
speak
common
sense
for
ten
minutes
when
preaching
from
his
pulpit
only
once
did
he
preach
while
i
was
his
vicar
and
then
he
was
not
half
through
his
sermon
before
the
greater
part
of
his
auditors
were
soundly
sleeping
but
who
could
hear
the
sermons
of
rev
bedard
without
feeling
his
heart
moved
and
his
soul
filled
with
terror
i
never
heard
anything
more
thrilling
than
his
words
when
speaking
of
the
judgments
of
god
and
the
punishment
of
the
wicked
perras
never
fasted
except
on
the
days
appointed
by
the
church
bedard
condemned
himself
to
fast
besides
twice
every
week
the
former
never
drank
to
my
knowledge
a
single
glass
of
rum
or
any
other
strong
drink
except
his
two
glasses
of
wine
at
dinner
but
the
latter
never
failed
to
drink
full
glasses
of
rum
three
times
a
day
beside
two
or
three
glasses
of
wine
at
dinner
perras
slept
the
whole
night
as
a
guiltless
child
bedard
almost
every
night
when
i
was
with
him
rose
up
and
lashed
himself
in
the
most
merciless
manner
with
leather
thongs
at
the
end
of
which
were
small
pieces
of
lead
when
inflicting
upon
himself
those
terrible
punishments
he
used
to
recite
by
heart
the
psalm
in
latin
miserere
mihi
deus
secundam
magnam
misericordiam
tuam
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
according
to
thy
loving
kindness
and
though
he
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
it
he
prayed
with
such
a
loud
voice
that
i
heard
every
word
he
uttered
he
also
struck
his
flesh
with
such
violence
that
i
could
count
all
the
blows
he
administered
one
day
i
respectfully
remonstrated
against
such
a
cruel
as
ruining
his
health
and
breaking
his
constitution
cher
petit
frere
dear
little
brother
he
answered
our
health
and
constitution
can
not
be
impaired
by
such
penances
but
they
are
easily
and
commonly
ruined
by
our
sins
i
am
one
of
the
healthiest
men
of
my
parish
though
i
have
inflicted
upon
myself
those
salutary
and
too
chastisements
for
many
years
though
i
am
old
i
am
still
a
great
sinner
i
have
an
implacable
and
indomitable
enemy
in
my
depraved
heart
which
i
can
not
subdue
except
by
punishing
my
flesh
if
i
do
not
do
those
penances
for
my
numberless
transgressions
who
will
do
them
for
me
if
i
do
not
pay
the
debts
i
owe
to
the
justice
of
god
who
will
pay
them
for
me
but
i
answered
has
not
our
saviour
jesus
christ
paid
our
debts
on
calvary
has
he
not
saved
and
redeemed
us
all
by
his
death
on
the
cross
why
then
should
you
or
i
pay
again
to
the
justice
of
god
that
which
has
been
so
perfectly
and
absolutely
paid
by
our
saviour
ah
my
dear
young
friend
quickly
replied
bedard
that
doctrine
you
hold
is
protestant
which
has
been
condemned
by
the
holy
council
of
trent
christ
has
paid
our
debts
certainly
but
not
in
such
an
absolute
way
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
paid
by
us
have
you
never
paid
attention
to
what
paul
says
in
his
epistle
to
the
colossians
i
fill
up
that
which
is
behind
of
the
sufferings
of
christ
in
the
flesh
for
his
body
s
sake
which
is
the
church
though
christ
could
have
entirely
and
absolutely
paid
our
debts
if
it
had
been
his
will
it
is
evident
that
such
was
not
his
holy
left
something
behind
which
paul
you
i
and
every
one
of
his
disciples
should
take
and
suffer
in
our
flesh
for
his
church
when
we
have
taken
and
accomplished
in
our
flesh
what
christ
has
left
behind
then
the
surplus
of
our
merits
goes
to
the
treasury
of
the
church
for
instance
when
a
saint
has
accomplished
in
his
flesh
what
christ
has
left
behind
for
his
perfect
sanctification
if
he
accomplishes
more
than
the
justice
of
god
requires
that
surplus
of
merits
not
being
any
use
to
him
is
put
by
god
into
the
grand
and
common
treasure
where
it
makes
a
fund
of
merits
of
infinite
value
from
which
the
pope
and
the
bishops
draw
the
indulgences
which
they
scatter
all
over
the
world
as
the
dew
from
heaven
by
the
mercy
of
god
the
penances
which
i
impose
upon
myself
and
the
pains
i
suffer
from
these
flagellations
purify
my
guilty
soul
and
raising
me
up
from
this
polluting
world
they
bring
me
nearer
and
nearer
to
my
god
every
day
i
am
not
yet
a
saint
unfortunately
but
if
by
the
mercy
of
god
and
my
penances
united
to
the
sufferings
of
christ
i
arrive
at
the
happy
day
when
all
my
debts
shall
be
paid
and
my
sins
cleansed
away
then
if
i
continue
those
penances
and
acquire
new
merits
more
than
i
need
and
if
i
pay
more
debts
than
i
owe
to
the
justice
of
god
this
surplus
of
merits
which
i
shall
have
acquired
will
go
to
the
rich
treasure
of
the
church
from
which
she
will
draw
merits
to
enrich
the
multitude
of
good
souls
who
can
not
do
enough
for
themselves
to
pay
their
own
debts
and
to
reach
that
point
of
holiness
which
will
deserve
a
crown
in
heaven
then
the
more
we
do
penance
and
inflict
pains
on
our
bodies
by
our
fastings
and
floggings
the
more
we
feel
happy
in
the
assurance
of
thus
raising
ourselves
more
and
more
above
the
dust
of
this
sinful
world
of
approaching
more
and
more
to
that
state
of
holiness
of
which
our
saviour
spoke
when
he
said
be
holy
as
i
am
holy
we
feel
an
unspeakable
joy
when
we
know
that
by
those
punishments
we
acquire
incalculable
merits
which
enrich
not
only
ourselves
but
our
holy
church
by
filling
her
treasures
for
the
benefit
and
salvation
of
the
souls
for
which
christ
died
on
when
bedard
was
feeding
my
soul
with
these
husks
he
was
speaking
with
great
animation
and
sincerity
like
myself
he
was
far
away
from
the
good
father
s
house
he
had
never
tasted
of
the
bread
of
the
children
neither
of
us
knew
anything
of
the
sweetness
of
that
bread
we
had
to
accept
those
husks
as
our
only
food
though
it
did
not
remove
our
hunger
i
answered
him
what
you
tell
me
here
is
what
i
find
in
all
our
ascetic
books
and
theological
treatises
and
in
the
lives
of
all
our
saints
i
can
hardly
reconcile
that
doctrine
with
what
i
read
this
morning
in
the
chapter
of
ephesians
here
is
the
verse
in
my
new
testament
but
god
who
is
rich
in
mercy
for
his
great
love
wherewith
he
loved
us
even
when
we
were
dead
in
sins
he
has
quickened
us
together
with
christ
by
grace
ye
are
saved
for
by
grace
ye
are
saved
through
faith
and
not
of
ourselves
it
is
this
gift
of
god
not
of
works
lest
any
man
should
now
my
dear
and
venerable
bedard
allow
me
respectfully
to
ask
how
it
is
possible
that
your
salvation
is
only
by
grace
if
you
have
to
purchase
it
every
day
by
tearing
your
flesh
and
lashing
your
body
in
such
a
fearful
manner
is
it
not
a
strange
very
singular
reddens
your
skin
with
your
blood
and
bruises
your
flesh
every
night
dear
little
brother
answered
bedard
when
perras
spoke
to
me
in
the
presence
of
the
bishop
with
such
deserved
eulogium
of
your
piety
he
did
not
conceal
that
you
had
a
very
dangerous
defect
which
was
to
spend
too
much
time
in
reading
the
bible
in
preference
to
every
other
of
our
holy
books
he
told
us
more
than
this
he
said
that
you
had
a
fatal
tendency
to
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
too
much
according
to
your
own
mind
and
in
a
sense
which
is
rather
more
protestant
than
catholic
i
am
sorry
to
see
that
the
curate
of
charles
was
but
too
correct
in
what
he
told
us
of
you
but
as
he
added
that
though
your
reading
too
much
the
holy
scriptures
brought
some
clouds
in
your
mind
yet
when
you
were
with
him
you
always
ended
by
yielding
to
the
sense
given
by
our
holy
church
this
did
not
prevent
me
from
desiring
to
have
you
in
my
place
during
my
absence
and
i
hope
we
will
not
regret
it
for
we
are
sure
that
our
dear
young
chiniquy
will
never
be
a
traitor
to
our
holy
these
words
which
were
given
with
a
great
solemnity
mixed
with
the
good
manners
of
the
most
sincere
kindness
went
through
my
soul
as
a
sword
i
felt
an
inexpressible
confusion
and
regret
and
biting
my
lips
i
said
i
have
sworn
never
to
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
except
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
and
with
the
help
of
god
i
will
fulfil
my
promise
i
regret
exceedingly
to
have
differed
for
a
moment
from
you
you
are
my
superior
by
your
age
your
science
and
your
piety
please
pardon
me
that
momentary
deviation
from
my
duty
and
pray
that
i
may
be
as
you
faithful
and
a
fearless
soldier
of
our
holy
church
to
the
at
that
moment
the
niece
of
the
curate
came
to
tell
us
that
the
dinner
was
ready
we
went
to
the
modest
though
exceedingly
table
and
to
my
great
pleasure
that
painful
conversation
was
dropped
we
had
not
sat
at
the
table
five
minutes
when
a
poor
man
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
a
piece
of
bread
for
the
sake
of
jesus
and
mary
bedard
rose
from
the
table
went
to
the
poor
stranger
and
said
come
my
friend
sit
between
me
and
our
dear
little
father
chiniquy
our
saviour
was
the
friend
of
the
poor
he
was
the
father
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
we
his
priests
must
walk
after
him
be
not
troubled
make
yourself
at
home
though
i
am
the
curate
of
charlesbourgh
i
am
your
brother
it
may
be
that
in
heaven
you
will
sit
on
a
higher
throne
than
mine
if
you
love
our
saviour
jesus
christ
and
his
holy
mother
mary
more
than
i
with
these
words
the
best
things
that
were
on
the
table
were
put
by
the
good
old
priest
on
the
plate
of
the
poor
stranger
who
with
some
hesitation
finished
by
doing
honor
to
the
excellent
viands
after
this
i
need
not
say
that
bedard
was
charitable
to
the
poor
he
always
treated
them
as
his
best
friends
so
also
was
my
former
curate
of
charles
and
though
his
charity
was
not
so
demonstrative
and
fraternal
as
that
of
bedard
i
had
never
yet
seen
a
poor
man
go
out
of
the
parsonage
of
charles
whose
breast
ought
not
to
have
been
filled
with
gratitude
and
joy
bedard
was
as
exact
as
perras
in
confessing
once
and
sometimes
twice
every
week
and
rather
than
fail
in
that
humiliating
act
they
both
in
the
absence
of
their
common
confessors
and
much
against
my
feelings
several
times
humbly
knelt
at
my
youthful
feet
to
confess
to
me
these
two
remarkable
men
had
the
same
views
about
the
immorality
and
the
want
of
religion
of
the
greater
part
of
the
priests
both
have
told
me
in
their
confidential
conversations
things
about
the
secret
lives
of
the
clergy
which
would
not
be
believed
were
i
to
publish
them
and
both
repeatedly
said
that
auricular
confession
was
the
daily
source
of
unspeakable
depravities
between
the
confessors
and
their
female
as
well
as
male
penitents
but
neither
of
them
had
sufficient
light
to
conclude
from
those
deeds
of
depravity
that
auricular
confession
was
a
diabolical
institution
they
both
sincerely
believed
as
i
did
then
that
the
institution
was
good
necessary
and
divine
and
that
it
was
a
source
of
perdition
to
so
many
priests
only
on
account
of
their
want
of
faith
and
piety
and
principally
from
their
neglect
of
prayers
to
the
virgin
mary
they
did
not
give
me
those
terrible
details
with
a
spirit
of
criticism
against
our
weak
brethren
their
intention
was
to
warn
me
against
the
dangers
which
were
as
great
for
me
as
for
others
they
both
invariably
finished
those
confidences
by
inviting
me
more
and
more
to
pray
constantly
to
the
mother
of
god
the
blessed
virgin
mary
and
to
watch
over
myself
and
avoid
remaining
alone
with
a
female
penitent
advising
me
also
to
treat
my
own
body
as
my
most
dangerous
enemy
by
reducing
it
into
subjection
to
the
law
and
crucifying
it
day
and
night
bedard
had
accompanied
the
bishop
of
quebec
in
his
episcopal
visits
during
many
years
and
had
seen
with
his
eyes
the
unmentionable
plague
which
was
then
as
it
is
now
devouring
the
very
vitals
of
the
church
of
rome
he
very
seldom
spoke
to
me
of
those
things
without
shedding
tears
of
compassion
over
the
guilty
priests
my
heart
and
my
soul
were
also
filled
with
an
unspeakable
sadness
when
hearing
the
details
of
such
iniquities
i
also
felt
struck
with
terror
lest
i
might
perish
myself
and
fall
into
the
same
bottomless
abyss
one
day
i
told
him
what
perras
had
revealed
to
me
about
the
distress
of
bishop
plessis
when
he
had
found
that
only
three
priests
besides
perras
believed
in
god
in
his
immense
diocese
i
asked
him
if
there
was
not
some
exaggeration
in
this
report
he
answered
after
a
profound
sigh
my
dear
young
friend
the
angel
could
not
find
ten
just
men
in
fear
is
that
they
would
not
find
more
among
the
priests
the
more
you
advance
in
age
the
more
you
will
see
that
awful
let
those
who
stand
fear
lest
they
fall
after
these
last
words
he
burst
into
tears
and
went
to
church
to
pray
at
the
feet
of
his
wafer
god
the
revelations
which
i
received
from
those
worthy
priests
did
not
in
any
way
shake
my
faith
in
my
church
she
even
became
dearer
to
me
just
as
a
dear
mother
gains
in
the
affection
and
devotedness
of
a
dutiful
son
as
her
trials
and
affliction
increase
it
seemed
to
me
that
after
this
knowledge
it
was
my
duty
to
do
more
than
i
had
ever
done
to
show
my
unreserved
devotedness
respect
and
love
to
my
holy
and
dear
mother
the
church
of
rome
out
of
which
i
sincerely
believed
then
there
was
no
salvation
these
revelations
became
to
me
in
the
good
providence
of
god
like
the
raised
on
the
hidden
and
dreadful
rocks
of
the
sea
to
warn
the
pilot
during
the
dark
hours
of
the
night
to
keep
at
a
distance
if
he
does
not
want
to
perish
though
these
two
priests
professed
to
have
a
most
profound
love
and
respect
for
the
holy
scriptures
they
gave
very
little
time
to
their
study
and
both
several
times
rebuked
me
for
passing
too
many
hours
in
their
perusal
and
repeatedly
warned
me
against
the
habit
of
constantly
appealing
to
them
against
certain
practices
and
teachings
of
our
theologians
as
good
roman
catholic
priests
they
had
no
right
to
go
to
the
holy
scriptures
alone
to
know
what
the
lord
saith
the
traditions
of
the
church
were
the
fountains
of
science
and
light
both
of
them
often
distressed
me
with
the
facility
with
which
they
buried
out
of
view
under
the
dark
clouds
of
their
traditions
the
clearest
texts
of
holy
scripture
which
i
used
to
quote
in
defence
of
my
positions
in
our
conversations
and
debates
they
both
with
an
equal
zeal
and
unfortunately
with
too
much
success
persuaded
me
that
it
was
right
for
the
church
to
ask
me
to
swear
that
i
would
never
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
except
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
but
when
i
showed
them
that
the
holy
fathers
had
never
been
unanimous
in
anything
except
in
differing
from
one
another
on
almost
every
subject
they
had
treated
when
i
demonstrated
by
our
church
historians
that
some
holy
fathers
had
very
different
views
from
ours
on
many
subjects
they
never
answered
my
questions
except
by
silencing
me
by
the
text
if
he
does
not
hear
the
church
let
him
be
as
a
heathen
or
a
publican
and
by
giving
me
long
lectures
on
the
danger
of
pride
and
bedard
had
many
opportunities
of
giving
me
his
views
about
the
submission
which
an
inferior
owes
to
his
superiors
he
was
of
one
mind
with
perras
and
all
the
theologians
who
had
treated
that
subject
they
both
taught
me
that
the
inferior
must
blindly
obey
his
superior
just
as
the
stick
must
obey
the
hand
that
holds
it
assuring
me
at
the
same
time
that
the
inferior
was
not
responsible
for
the
errors
he
commits
when
obeying
his
legitimate
superior
bedard
and
perras
had
a
great
love
for
their
saviour
jesus
but
the
jesus
christ
whom
they
loved
and
respected
and
adored
was
not
the
christ
of
the
gospel
but
the
christ
of
the
church
of
rome
perras
and
bedard
had
a
great
fear
as
well
as
a
sincere
love
for
their
god
while
yet
they
professed
to
make
him
every
morning
by
the
act
of
consecration
they
also
most
sincerely
believed
and
preached
that
idolatry
was
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
a
man
could
commit
but
they
themselves
were
every
day
worshipping
an
idol
of
their
own
creating
they
were
forced
by
their
church
to
renew
the
awful
iniquity
of
aaron
with
this
difference
only
that
while
aaron
made
his
gods
of
melted
gold
and
molded
them
into
a
figure
of
a
calf
they
made
theirs
of
flour
baked
between
two
heated
and
irons
and
in
the
form
of
a
crucified
man
when
aaron
spoke
of
his
golden
calf
to
the
people
he
said
these
are
thy
gods
o
israel
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
so
likewise
bedard
and
perras
showing
the
wafer
to
the
deluded
people
said
ecce
agnus
die
qui
tollit
peccata
mundi
behold
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
these
two
sincere
and
honest
priests
placed
the
utmost
confidence
also
in
relics
and
scapularies
i
have
heard
both
say
that
no
fatal
accident
could
happen
to
one
who
had
a
scapulary
on
his
sudden
death
would
overtake
a
man
who
was
faithful
about
keeping
those
blessed
scapularies
about
his
person
both
of
them
nevertheless
died
suddenly
and
that
too
of
the
saddest
of
deaths
bedard
dropped
dead
on
the
of
may
at
a
great
dinner
given
to
his
friends
he
was
in
the
act
of
swallowing
a
glass
of
that
drink
of
which
god
says
look
not
upon
the
wine
when
it
is
red
when
it
giveth
its
color
in
the
cup
when
it
moveth
itself
aright
at
the
last
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
and
stingeth
like
an
the
rev
perras
sad
to
say
became
a
lunatic
in
and
died
the
of
july
in
a
fit
of
delirium
chapter
xxiii
the
cholera
morbus
of
courage
and
of
the
priests
of
rome
during
that
epidemic
i
had
not
been
more
than
three
weeks
the
administrator
of
the
parish
of
charlesbourgh
when
the
terrible
words
the
cholera
morbus
is
in
quebec
sent
a
thrill
of
terror
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
canada
the
cities
of
quebec
and
montreal
with
many
surrounding
country
places
had
been
decimated
in
by
the
same
terrible
scourge
thousands
upon
thousands
had
fallen
its
victims
families
in
every
rank
of
society
had
disappeared
for
the
most
skillful
physicians
of
both
europe
and
america
had
been
unable
to
stop
its
march
and
ravages
but
the
year
had
passed
without
hearing
almost
of
a
single
case
of
that
fatal
disease
we
had
all
the
hope
that
the
justice
of
god
was
satisfied
and
that
he
would
no
more
visit
us
with
that
horrible
plague
in
this
however
we
were
to
be
sadly
disappointed
charlesbourgh
is
a
kind
of
suburb
of
quebec
the
greatest
part
of
its
inhabitants
had
to
go
within
its
walls
to
sell
their
goods
several
times
every
week
it
was
evident
that
we
were
to
be
among
the
first
visited
by
that
messenger
of
a
just
but
angry
god
i
will
never
forget
the
hour
after
i
had
heard
the
cholera
is
in
quebec
it
was
indeed
a
most
solemn
hour
to
me
at
a
glance
i
measured
the
bottomless
abyss
which
was
dug
under
my
feet
we
had
no
physicians
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
having
any
they
were
to
have
more
work
than
they
could
do
in
quebec
i
saw
that
i
would
have
to
be
both
the
body
and
the
of
the
numberless
victims
of
this
terrible
disease
the
tortures
of
the
dying
the
cries
of
the
widows
and
of
the
orphans
the
almost
unbearable
stench
of
the
houses
attacked
by
the
scourge
the
desolation
and
the
paralyzing
fears
of
the
whole
people
the
fatherless
and
motherless
orphans
by
whom
i
was
to
be
surrounded
the
starving
poor
for
whom
i
would
have
to
provide
food
and
clothing
when
every
kind
or
work
and
industry
was
stopped
but
above
all
the
crowds
of
penitents
whom
the
terrors
of
an
impending
death
would
drag
to
my
feet
to
make
their
confessions
that
i
might
forgive
their
sins
passed
through
my
mind
as
so
many
spectres
i
fell
on
my
knees
with
a
heart
beating
with
emotions
that
no
pen
can
describe
and
prostrating
myself
before
my
too
justly
angry
god
i
cried
for
mercy
with
torrents
of
tears
i
asked
him
to
take
away
my
life
as
a
sacrifice
for
my
people
but
to
spare
them
raising
my
eyes
towards
a
beautiful
statue
of
mary
whom
i
believed
to
be
then
the
mother
of
god
i
supplicated
her
to
appease
the
wrath
of
her
son
i
was
still
on
my
knees
when
several
knocks
at
the
door
told
me
that
some
one
wanted
to
speak
to
young
woman
was
there
bathed
in
tears
and
pale
as
death
who
said
to
me
my
father
has
just
returned
from
quebec
and
is
dying
from
the
come
quick
to
hear
his
confession
before
he
expires
no
tongue
will
ever
be
able
to
tell
half
of
the
horrors
which
strike
the
eyes
and
the
mind
the
first
time
one
enters
the
house
of
a
man
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
death
from
cholera
the
other
diseases
seem
to
attack
only
one
part
of
the
body
at
once
but
the
cholera
is
like
a
furious
tiger
whose
sharp
teeth
and
nails
tear
his
victim
from
head
to
feet
without
sparing
any
part
the
hands
and
the
feet
the
legs
and
the
arms
the
stomach
the
breast
and
the
bowels
are
at
once
tortured
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
terrific
as
the
fixed
eyes
of
that
first
victim
whom
i
had
to
prepare
for
death
he
was
already
almost
as
cold
as
a
piece
of
ice
he
was
vomiting
and
ejecting
an
incredible
quantity
of
a
watery
and
blackish
matter
which
filled
the
house
with
an
unbearable
smell
with
a
feeble
voice
he
requested
me
to
hear
the
confession
of
his
sins
and
i
ordered
the
family
to
withdraw
and
leave
me
alone
that
they
might
not
hear
the
sad
story
of
his
transgressions
but
he
had
not
said
five
words
before
he
cried
out
oh
my
god
what
horrible
cramps
in
my
leg
for
god
s
sake
rub
and
when
i
had
given
up
hearing
his
confession
to
rub
the
leg
he
cried
out
again
oh
what
horrible
cramps
in
my
arms
my
feet
my
shoulders
my
stomach
and
to
the
utmost
of
my
capacity
and
my
strength
i
rubbed
his
arms
his
feet
his
shoulders
his
breast
till
i
felt
so
exhausted
and
covered
with
perspiration
that
i
feared
i
should
faint
during
that
time
the
fetid
matter
ejected
from
his
stomach
besmeared
me
almost
from
head
to
foot
i
called
for
help
and
two
strong
men
continued
with
me
to
rub
the
poor
dying
man
it
seemed
evident
that
he
could
not
live
very
long
his
sufferings
looked
so
horrible
and
unbearable
i
administered
him
the
sacrament
of
but
i
did
not
leave
the
house
after
that
ceremony
as
it
is
the
custom
of
the
priests
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
met
face
to
face
with
that
giant
which
had
covered
so
many
nations
with
desolation
and
ruin
caused
so
many
torrents
of
tears
to
flow
i
had
heard
so
much
of
him
i
knew
that
till
then
nothing
had
been
able
to
stop
his
forward
march
he
had
scornfully
gone
through
the
obstacles
which
the
most
powerful
nations
had
placed
before
him
to
retard
his
progress
he
had
mocked
the
art
and
the
science
of
the
most
skillful
physicians
all
over
the
world
in
a
single
step
he
had
gone
from
moscow
to
paris
in
another
step
he
had
crossed
the
bottomless
seas
which
the
hands
of
the
almighty
have
spread
between
europe
and
america
that
king
of
terrors
after
piling
in
their
graves
by
millions
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
old
and
the
young
whom
he
had
met
on
his
march
through
asia
africa
europe
and
america
was
now
before
me
nay
he
was
torturing
before
my
eyes
the
first
victim
he
had
chosen
among
my
people
but
the
more
i
felt
powerless
in
the
presence
of
that
mighty
giant
the
more
i
wanted
to
see
him
face
to
face
i
had
as
a
secret
pleasure
a
holy
pride
in
daring
him
i
wanted
to
tell
him
i
do
not
fear
you
you
mercilessly
attack
my
people
but
with
the
help
of
god
in
the
strength
of
the
one
who
died
on
calvary
for
me
and
who
told
me
that
nothing
was
more
sweet
and
glorious
than
to
give
my
life
for
my
friends
i
will
meet
and
fight
you
everywhere
when
you
attack
any
one
of
those
sheep
who
are
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
life
standing
by
the
bedside
of
the
dying
man
whilst
i
rubbed
his
limbs
to
alleviate
his
tortures
i
exhorted
him
to
repent
but
i
closely
watched
that
hand
to
hand
merciless
and
unequal
struggle
between
the
giant
and
his
poor
victim
his
agony
was
long
and
terrible
for
he
was
a
man
of
great
bodily
strength
but
after
several
hours
of
the
most
frightful
pains
he
quietly
breathed
his
last
the
house
was
crowded
with
the
neighbors
and
relations
who
forgetful
of
the
danger
of
catching
the
disease
had
come
to
see
him
we
all
knelt
and
prayed
for
the
departed
soul
after
which
i
gave
them
a
few
words
about
the
necessity
of
giving
up
their
sins
and
keeping
themselves
ready
to
die
and
go
at
the
master
s
call
i
then
left
that
desolated
house
with
feelings
of
distress
which
no
pen
can
portray
when
i
got
back
to
the
parsonage
after
praying
and
weeping
alone
in
my
closet
i
took
a
bath
and
washed
myself
with
vinegar
and
a
mixture
of
camphor
as
a
preventive
against
the
epidemic
the
rest
of
the
day
till
ten
at
night
was
spent
in
hearing
the
confessions
of
a
great
number
of
people
whom
the
fear
of
death
had
dragged
around
my
confessional
box
that
i
might
forgive
their
sins
this
hearing
of
confession
was
interrupted
only
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
when
i
was
called
to
the
cemetery
to
bury
the
first
victim
of
the
cholera
in
charlesbourgh
a
great
number
of
people
had
accompanied
the
corpse
to
his
last
the
night
was
beautiful
the
atmosphere
balmy
and
the
moon
and
stars
had
never
appeared
to
me
so
bright
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
broken
only
by
the
sobs
of
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
deceased
it
was
one
of
the
best
opportunities
god
had
ever
given
me
of
exhorting
the
people
to
repentance
i
took
for
my
text
therefore
be
ye
also
ready
for
in
such
an
hour
as
ye
think
not
the
son
of
man
the
spectacle
of
that
grave
filled
by
a
man
who
hours
before
was
full
of
health
and
life
in
the
midst
of
his
happy
family
was
speaking
more
eloquently
than
the
words
of
my
lips
to
show
that
we
must
be
always
ready
and
never
any
people
entered
the
threshold
of
their
homes
with
more
solemn
thoughts
than
those
to
whom
i
spoke
that
night
in
the
midst
of
the
graveyard
the
history
of
that
day
is
the
history
of
the
forty
days
which
not
a
single
one
of
them
passed
without
my
being
called
to
visit
a
victim
of
the
than
one
hundred
people
were
attacked
by
the
terrible
disease
nearly
forty
of
whom
died
i
can
not
sufficiently
thank
my
merciful
god
for
having
protected
me
in
such
a
marvelous
way
that
i
had
not
a
single
hour
of
disease
during
those
two
months
of
hard
labors
and
sore
trials
i
had
to
visit
the
sick
not
only
as
a
priest
but
as
physician
also
for
seeing
at
first
the
absolute
impossibility
of
persuading
any
physician
from
quebec
to
give
up
their
rich
city
patients
for
our
more
humble
farmers
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
make
myself
as
expert
as
i
could
in
the
art
of
helping
the
victims
of
that
cruel
and
loathsome
disease
i
studied
the
best
authors
on
that
subject
consulted
the
most
skillful
physicians
got
a
little
pharmacy
which
would
have
done
honor
to
an
old
physician
and
i
gave
my
care
and
my
medicine
gratis
very
soon
the
good
people
of
charlesbourgh
put
as
much
if
not
more
confidence
in
my
medical
care
as
in
any
other
of
the
best
physicians
of
the
country
more
than
once
i
had
to
rub
the
limbs
of
so
many
patients
in
the
same
day
that
the
skin
of
my
hands
was
taken
away
and
several
times
the
blood
come
out
from
the
wounds
painchaud
one
of
the
ablest
physicians
of
quebec
who
was
my
personal
friend
told
me
after
that
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
thing
that
i
had
not
fallen
a
victim
to
that
disease
i
would
never
have
mentioned
what
i
did
in
those
days
of
the
cholera
of
when
one
of
the
most
horrible
epidemics
which
the
world
has
ever
seen
spread
desolation
and
death
almost
all
over
canada
if
i
had
been
alone
to
work
as
i
did
but
i
am
happy
and
proud
to
say
that
without
a
single
exception
the
french
canadian
priests
whose
parishes
were
attacked
by
that
pestilence
did
the
same
i
could
name
hundreds
of
them
who
during
several
months
also
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
bravely
met
and
fought
the
enemy
and
fearlessly
presented
their
breasts
to
its
blows
i
could
even
name
scores
of
them
who
heroically
fell
and
died
when
facing
the
foe
on
that
battlefield
we
must
be
honest
and
true
towards
the
roman
catholic
priests
of
canada
few
men
if
even
any
have
shown
more
courage
and
in
the
hour
of
danger
than
they
did
i
have
seen
them
at
work
during
the
two
memorable
years
of
and
with
a
courage
and
worthy
of
the
admiration
of
heaven
and
earth
though
they
knew
well
that
the
most
horrible
tortures
and
death
might
be
the
price
of
their
devotedness
i
have
not
known
a
single
one
of
them
who
ever
shrank
before
the
danger
at
the
first
appeal
in
the
midst
of
the
darkest
and
stormiest
nights
as
well
as
in
the
light
of
the
brightest
days
they
were
always
ready
to
leave
their
warm
and
comfortable
beds
to
run
to
the
rescue
of
the
sick
and
dying
but
shall
we
conclude
from
that
as
the
priests
of
rome
want
us
to
do
that
their
religion
is
the
true
and
divine
religion
of
christ
must
we
believe
that
because
the
priests
are
brave
admirably
brave
and
die
the
death
of
heroes
on
the
battlefields
they
are
the
true
the
only
priests
of
christ
the
successors
of
the
ministers
of
the
religion
out
of
which
there
is
no
salvation
no
was
it
because
his
religion
was
the
divine
and
only
true
one
that
the
millionaire
stephen
gerard
when
in
philadelphia
was
decimated
by
a
most
frightful
epidemic
went
from
house
to
house
visiting
the
sick
serving
washing
them
with
his
own
hands
and
even
helping
to
put
them
into
their
coffins
i
ask
it
again
is
it
because
his
religion
was
the
divine
religion
of
jesus
that
that
remarkable
man
during
several
months
lived
among
the
dying
and
the
dead
to
help
them
when
his
immense
fortune
allowed
him
to
put
a
whole
world
between
him
and
the
danger
no
for
every
one
knows
that
stephen
gerard
was
a
deist
who
did
not
believe
in
christ
was
it
because
they
followed
the
true
religion
that
in
the
last
war
between
russia
and
turkey
a
whole
regiment
of
turks
heroically
ran
to
a
sure
death
to
obey
the
order
of
their
general
who
commanded
them
to
charge
bayonets
on
a
russian
battery
which
was
pouring
upon
them
a
real
hail
of
bullets
and
canisters
no
surely
no
these
turks
were
brave
fearless
heroic
soldiers
but
nothing
more
so
the
priests
of
the
pope
who
expose
themselves
in
the
hour
of
danger
are
brave
fearless
heroic
soldiers
of
the
they
are
nothing
more
was
it
because
they
were
good
christians
that
the
soldiers
of
a
french
regiment
at
austerlitz
consented
to
be
slaughtered
to
the
last
at
the
head
of
a
bridge
where
napoleon
had
ordered
them
to
remain
with
these
celebrated
words
soldiers
stand
there
and
fight
to
the
last
you
will
all
be
killed
but
you
will
save
the
army
and
we
will
gain
the
day
those
soldiers
were
admirably
well
loved
their
flag
more
than
their
knew
only
one
thing
in
the
world
obey
the
command
of
napoleon
they
fought
like
giants
and
died
like
heroes
so
the
priests
are
a
band
of
soldiers
they
are
trained
to
love
their
church
more
than
their
own
life
they
also
know
only
one
thing
obey
your
superior
the
pope
they
fight
the
battle
of
their
church
like
giants
and
they
die
like
heroes
who
has
not
read
the
history
of
the
renowned
french
the
tonnant
when
she
had
lost
her
masts
and
was
so
crippled
by
the
red
bullets
of
the
english
fleet
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
what
did
the
soldiers
and
mariners
of
that
ship
answer
to
the
cries
of
surrender
which
came
from
the
english
admiral
we
die
but
do
not
surrender
they
all
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
perished
rather
than
see
their
proud
banners
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
foe
is
it
because
those
french
warriors
were
good
christians
that
they
preferred
to
die
rather
than
give
up
their
flag
no
but
they
knew
that
the
eyes
of
their
country
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
were
upon
them
life
became
to
them
a
trifle
it
became
nothing
when
placed
in
the
balance
against
what
they
considered
their
honor
and
the
honor
of
their
fair
and
noble
country
life
became
an
undesirable
thing
when
it
was
weighted
against
the
glory
of
dying
at
the
post
of
duty
and
honor
so
it
is
with
the
priest
of
rome
he
knows
that
the
eyes
of
his
people
and
of
his
eyes
of
his
whole
church
are
upon
him
he
knows
that
if
he
shrinks
in
the
hour
of
danger
he
will
forever
lose
their
confidence
and
their
esteem
that
he
will
lose
his
position
and
live
the
life
of
a
degraded
man
death
seems
preferable
to
such
a
life
besides
it
is
not
only
in
the
gospel
of
christ
that
we
read
this
is
my
commandment
that
ye
love
one
another
as
i
have
loved
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
our
great
god
has
written
these
words
in
the
hearts
of
all
the
children
of
adam
he
has
written
them
in
the
very
heart
of
humanity
these
words
are
engraven
in
the
hearts
of
the
turks
of
constantinople
as
well
as
in
the
hearts
of
the
priests
of
canada
they
are
engraven
in
the
hearts
of
the
esquimaux
of
the
icy
regions
of
greenland
as
well
as
in
the
hearts
of
the
refined
citizens
of
paris
hence
in
the
midst
of
the
wreck
of
almost
all
the
other
virtues
we
find
a
spark
of
that
sacred
fire
kept
alive
everywhere
for
again
god
almighty
himself
has
breathed
that
spark
of
fire
and
life
into
the
heart
of
man
when
he
made
him
in
his
own
image
we
find
that
spark
of
holy
and
inextinguishable
fire
of
love
and
life
even
among
the
most
depraved
nations
for
that
nation
must
infallibly
perish
and
disappear
the
day
it
has
lost
it
entirely
this
is
the
reason
why
even
among
the
degraded
idolaters
of
ancient
and
modern
times
we
find
acts
of
admirable
devotedness
and
read
the
history
of
the
iroquois
written
by
the
jesuit
father
charlevoix
and
you
will
see
how
the
savages
of
our
forests
often
raised
themselves
to
the
very
stature
of
giants
at
the
approach
of
death
when
the
honor
of
their
nations
or
the
interests
of
their
friends
or
their
own
reputation
was
at
stake
no
men
have
ever
carried
the
contempt
of
pain
and
death
so
far
perhaps
as
the
heathen
iroquois
of
this
continent
yes
let
the
people
of
canada
read
the
history
of
la
nouvelle
france
and
they
will
cease
from
presenting
to
us
the
courage
of
their
priests
as
an
indication
of
the
divinity
of
their
religion
for
there
they
will
see
that
the
worshippers
of
the
wooden
gods
of
the
forests
have
equalled
if
not
surpassed
in
courage
and
in
the
face
of
death
the
courage
and
of
the
priests
of
the
wafer
god
of
rome
chapter
xxiv
i
am
named
a
vicar
of
roch
quebec
rev
seal
skins
in
the
beginning
of
september
the
bishop
synaie
gave
me
the
enviable
position
of
one
of
the
vicars
of
roch
quebec
where
the
rev
tetu
had
been
curate
for
about
a
year
he
was
one
of
the
seventeen
children
of
francis
tetu
one
of
the
most
respectable
and
wealthy
farmers
of
thomas
such
was
the
amiability
of
character
of
my
new
curate
that
i
never
saw
him
in
bad
humor
a
single
time
during
the
four
years
that
it
was
my
fortune
to
work
under
him
in
that
parish
and
although
in
my
daily
intercourse
with
him
i
sometimes
unintentionally
sorely
tried
his
patience
i
never
heard
an
unkind
word
proceed
from
his
lips
he
was
a
man
tall
and
large
forehead
blue
eyes
a
remarkably
fine
nose
and
rosy
lips
only
a
little
too
feminine
his
skin
was
very
white
for
a
man
but
his
fine
short
whiskers
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
trim
gave
to
his
whole
mien
a
manly
and
pleasant
appearance
he
was
the
finest
penman
i
ever
saw
and
by
far
the
most
skillful
skater
of
the
country
nothing
could
surpass
the
agility
and
perfection
with
which
he
used
to
write
his
name
on
the
ice
with
his
skates
he
was
also
fond
of
fast
horses
and
knew
to
perfection
how
to
handle
the
most
unmanageable
steeds
of
quebec
he
really
looked
like
phaeton
when
in
a
light
and
beautiful
buggy
he
held
the
reins
of
the
fiery
coursers
which
the
rich
bourgeois
of
the
city
liked
to
trust
to
him
once
or
twice
a
week
that
he
might
take
a
ride
with
one
of
his
vicars
to
the
surrounding
country
tetu
was
also
fond
of
fine
cigars
and
choice
chewing
tobacco
like
the
late
pope
pius
he
also
constantly
used
the
he
would
have
been
a
pretty
good
preacher
had
he
not
been
born
with
a
natural
horror
of
books
i
very
seldom
saw
in
his
hands
any
other
books
than
his
breviary
and
some
treatises
on
the
catechism
a
book
in
his
hands
had
almost
the
effect
of
opium
on
one
s
brains
it
put
him
to
sleep
one
day
when
i
had
finished
reading
a
volume
of
tertullian
he
felt
much
interested
in
what
i
said
of
the
eloquence
and
learning
of
that
celebrated
father
of
the
church
and
expressed
a
desire
to
read
it
i
smilingly
asked
him
if
he
were
more
than
usual
in
need
of
sleep
he
seriously
answered
me
that
he
really
wanted
to
read
that
work
and
that
he
wished
to
begin
its
study
just
then
i
lent
him
the
volume
and
he
went
immediately
to
his
room
in
order
to
enrich
his
mind
with
the
treasures
of
eloquence
and
wisdom
of
that
celebrated
writer
of
the
primitive
church
half
an
hour
after
suspecting
what
would
occur
i
went
down
to
his
room
and
noiselessly
opening
the
door
i
found
my
dear
tetu
sleeping
on
his
soft
sofa
and
snoring
to
his
heart
s
content
while
tertullian
was
lying
on
the
floor
i
ran
to
the
rooms
of
the
other
vicars
and
told
them
come
and
see
how
our
good
curate
is
studying
tertullian
there
is
no
need
to
say
that
we
had
a
hearty
laugh
at
his
expense
unfortunately
the
noise
we
made
awoke
him
and
we
then
asked
him
what
do
you
think
of
tertullian
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
answered
well
well
what
is
the
matter
are
you
not
four
very
wicked
men
to
laugh
at
the
human
frailties
of
your
curate
we
for
awhile
called
him
father
tertullian
another
day
he
requested
me
to
give
him
some
english
lessons
for
though
my
knowledge
of
english
was
then
very
limited
i
was
the
only
one
of
five
priests
who
understood
and
could
speak
a
few
words
of
that
language
i
answered
him
that
it
would
be
as
pleasant
as
it
was
easy
for
me
to
teach
the
little
i
knew
of
it
and
i
advised
him
to
subscribe
for
the
quebec
gazette
that
i
might
profit
by
the
interesting
matter
which
that
paper
used
to
give
to
its
readers
and
at
the
same
time
i
should
teach
him
to
read
and
understand
its
contents
the
third
time
that
i
went
to
his
room
to
give
him
his
lesson
he
gravely
asked
me
have
you
ever
seen
general
cargo
i
was
at
first
puzzled
by
that
question
and
answered
him
i
never
heard
that
there
was
any
military
officer
by
the
name
of
general
how
do
you
know
that
there
is
such
a
general
in
the
world
he
quickly
answered
there
is
surely
a
general
cargo
somewhere
in
england
or
america
and
he
must
be
very
rich
for
see
the
large
number
of
ships
which
bear
his
name
and
have
entered
the
port
of
quebec
these
last
few
days
seeing
the
strange
mistake
and
finding
his
ignorance
so
wonderful
i
burst
into
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
i
could
not
answer
a
word
but
cried
at
the
top
of
my
voice
general
cargo
general
cargo
the
poor
curate
stunned
by
my
laughing
looked
at
me
in
amazement
but
unable
to
understand
its
cause
he
asked
me
why
do
you
laugh
but
the
more
stupefied
he
was
the
more
i
laughed
unable
to
say
anything
but
general
cargo
general
cargo
the
three
other
vicars
hearing
the
noise
hastily
came
from
their
rooms
to
learn
its
cause
and
get
a
good
laugh
also
but
i
was
so
completely
beside
myself
with
laughing
that
i
could
not
answer
their
questions
in
any
other
way
than
by
crying
general
cargo
general
cargo
the
puzzled
curate
tried
then
to
give
them
some
explanation
of
that
mystery
saying
with
the
greatest
naivete
i
can
not
see
why
our
little
father
chiniquy
is
laughing
so
convulsively
i
put
him
a
very
simple
question
when
he
entered
my
room
to
give
me
my
english
lesson
i
simply
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
seen
general
cargo
who
has
sent
so
many
ships
to
our
ports
these
last
few
days
and
added
that
that
general
must
be
very
rich
since
he
has
so
many
ships
on
the
sea
the
three
vicars
saw
the
point
and
without
being
able
to
answer
him
a
word
they
burst
into
such
fits
of
laughter
that
the
poor
curate
felt
more
than
ever
puzzled
are
you
crazy
he
said
what
makes
you
laugh
so
when
i
put
to
you
such
a
simple
question
do
you
not
know
anything
about
that
general
cargo
who
surely
must
live
somewhere
and
be
very
rich
since
he
sends
so
many
vessels
to
our
port
that
they
fill
nearly
two
columns
of
the
quebec
gazette
these
remarks
of
the
poor
curate
brought
such
a
new
storm
of
irrepressible
laughter
from
us
all
as
we
never
experienced
in
our
whole
lives
it
took
us
some
time
to
sufficiently
master
our
feelings
to
tell
him
that
general
cargo
was
not
the
name
of
any
individual
but
only
the
technical
words
to
say
that
the
ships
were
laden
with
general
goods
the
next
morning
the
young
and
jovial
vicars
gave
the
story
to
their
friends
and
the
people
of
quebec
had
a
hearty
laugh
at
the
expense
of
our
friend
from
that
time
we
called
our
good
curate
by
the
name
of
general
cargo
and
he
was
so
that
he
joined
with
us
in
joking
at
his
own
expense
it
would
require
too
much
space
were
i
to
publish
all
the
comic
blunders
of
that
good
man
so
i
shall
give
only
one
more
on
one
of
the
coldest
days
in
january
a
merchant
of
seal
skins
came
to
the
parsonage
with
some
of
the
best
specimens
of
his
merchandise
that
we
might
buy
them
to
make
overcoats
for
in
those
days
the
overcoats
of
buffalo
or
raccoon
skins
were
not
yet
thought
of
our
richest
men
used
to
have
beaver
overcoats
but
the
rest
of
the
people
had
to
be
contented
with
canada
seal
skins
a
beaver
overcoat
could
not
be
had
for
less
than
tetu
was
anxious
to
buy
his
skins
his
only
difficulty
was
the
high
price
asked
by
the
merchant
for
nearly
an
hour
he
had
turned
over
and
over
again
the
beautiful
skins
and
had
spent
all
his
eloquence
on
trying
to
bring
down
their
price
when
the
sexton
arrived
and
told
him
respectfully
mr
le
cure
there
are
a
couple
of
people
waiting
for
you
with
a
child
to
be
very
well
said
the
curate
i
will
go
immediately
and
addressing
the
merchant
he
said
please
wait
a
moment
i
will
not
be
long
in
two
minutes
after
the
curate
had
donned
the
surplice
and
was
going
at
full
speed
through
the
prayers
and
ceremonies
of
baptism
for
to
be
fair
and
true
towards
tetu
and
i
might
say
the
same
thing
of
the
greatest
part
of
the
priests
i
have
known
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
was
very
exact
in
all
his
ministerial
duties
yet
he
was
in
this
case
going
through
them
by
steam
if
not
by
electricity
he
was
soon
at
the
end
but
after
the
sacrament
was
administered
we
were
enjoined
then
to
repeat
an
exhortation
to
the
godfathers
and
godmothers
from
the
ritual
which
we
all
knew
by
heart
and
which
began
with
these
words
godfather
and
godmothers
you
have
brought
a
sinner
to
the
church
but
you
will
take
back
a
saint
as
the
vestry
was
full
of
people
who
had
come
to
confess
tetu
thought
that
it
was
his
duty
to
speak
with
more
emphasis
than
usual
in
order
to
have
his
instructions
heard
and
felt
by
everyone
but
instead
of
saying
godfather
and
godmother
you
have
brought
a
sinner
to
the
church
you
will
take
back
a
saint
he
with
great
force
and
unction
said
godfather
and
godmother
you
have
brought
a
sinner
to
the
church
you
will
take
back
a
no
words
can
describe
the
uncontrollable
burst
and
roar
of
laughter
among
the
crowd
when
they
heard
that
the
baptized
child
was
just
changed
into
a
seal
unable
to
contain
themselves
or
do
any
serious
thing
they
left
the
vestry
to
go
home
and
laugh
to
their
heart
s
content
but
the
most
comic
part
of
this
blunder
was
the
and
the
calmness
with
which
tetu
turning
towards
me
said
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
the
cause
of
that
indecent
and
universal
laughing
in
the
midst
of
such
a
solemn
action
as
the
baptism
of
this
child
i
tried
to
tell
him
his
blunder
but
for
some
time
it
was
impossible
to
express
myself
my
laughing
propensities
were
so
much
excited
and
the
convulsive
laughter
of
the
whole
multitude
made
such
a
noise
that
he
would
not
have
heard
me
had
i
been
able
to
answer
him
it
was
only
when
the
greatest
part
of
the
crowd
had
left
that
i
could
reveal
to
tetu
that
he
had
changed
the
baptized
baby
into
a
seal
skin
he
heartily
laughed
at
his
own
blunder
and
calmly
went
back
to
buy
his
seal
skins
the
next
day
the
story
went
from
house
to
house
in
quebec
and
caused
everywhere
such
a
laugh
as
they
had
not
had
since
the
birth
of
general
that
priest
was
a
good
type
of
the
greatest
part
of
the
priests
of
canada
fine
and
jovial
fond
of
smoking
their
cigars
as
of
chewing
their
tobacco
and
using
their
snuff
fond
of
fast
horses
repeating
the
prayers
of
their
breviary
and
going
through
the
performance
of
their
ministerial
duties
with
as
much
speed
as
possible
with
a
good
number
of
books
in
their
libraries
but
knowing
nothing
of
them
but
the
titles
possessing
the
bible
but
ignorant
of
its
contents
believing
that
they
had
the
light
when
they
were
in
awful
darkness
preaching
the
most
monstrous
doctrines
as
the
gospel
of
truth
considering
themselves
the
only
true
christians
in
the
world
when
they
worshipped
the
most
contemptible
idols
made
with
hands
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
word
of
god
while
they
proclaimed
and
believed
themselves
to
be
the
lights
of
the
world
unfortunate
blind
men
leading
the
blind
into
the
ditch
chapter
xxv
and
sacrilegious
traffic
in
the
body
and
blood
of
sums
of
money
made
by
the
sale
of
society
of
three
masses
abolished
and
the
society
of
one
mass
established
in
one
of
the
pleasant
hours
which
we
used
invariably
to
pass
after
dinner
in
the
comfortable
parlor
of
our
parsonage
one
of
the
vicars
louis
parent
said
to
the
rev
tetu
i
have
handed
this
morning
more
than
one
hundred
dollars
to
the
bishop
as
the
price
of
the
masses
which
my
pious
penitents
have
requested
me
to
celebrate
the
greatest
part
of
them
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
every
week
i
have
to
do
the
same
thing
just
as
each
of
you
and
every
one
of
the
hundreds
of
priests
in
canada
have
to
do
now
i
would
like
to
know
how
the
bishops
can
dispose
of
all
these
masses
and
what
they
do
with
the
large
sums
of
money
which
go
into
their
hands
from
every
part
of
the
country
to
have
masses
said
this
question
vexes
me
and
i
would
like
to
know
your
mind
about
the
good
curate
answered
in
a
joking
manner
as
usual
if
the
masses
paid
into
our
hands
which
go
to
the
bishop
are
all
celebrated
purgatory
must
be
emptied
twice
a
day
for
i
have
calculated
that
the
sums
given
for
those
masses
in
canada
can
not
be
less
than
every
day
and
as
there
are
three
times
as
many
catholics
in
the
united
states
as
here
and
as
those
irish
catholics
are
more
devoted
to
the
souls
in
purgatory
than
the
canadians
there
is
no
exaggeration
in
saying
that
they
give
as
much
as
our
people
at
least
will
thus
be
given
every
day
in
these
two
countries
to
throw
cold
water
on
the
burning
flames
of
that
fiery
prison
now
these
given
every
day
multiplied
by
the
days
of
the
year
make
the
handsome
sum
of
paid
for
that
object
in
low
masses
every
year
but
as
we
all
know
that
more
than
twice
as
much
is
paid
for
high
masses
than
for
the
low
it
is
evident
that
more
than
are
expended
to
help
the
souls
of
purgatory
end
their
tortures
every
twelve
months
in
north
america
alone
if
those
millions
of
dollars
do
not
benefit
the
good
souls
in
purgatory
they
at
all
events
are
of
some
benefit
to
our
pious
bishops
and
holy
popes
in
whose
hands
the
greatest
part
must
remain
till
the
day
of
judgment
for
there
is
not
a
sufficient
number
of
priests
in
the
world
to
say
all
the
masses
which
are
paid
for
by
the
people
i
do
not
know
any
more
than
you
do
about
what
the
bishops
do
with
those
millions
of
dollars
they
keep
that
among
their
secret
good
works
but
it
is
evident
there
is
a
serious
mystery
here
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
yankee
and
the
canadian
bishops
swallow
those
huge
piles
of
dollars
as
sweet
oranges
or
that
they
are
a
band
of
big
swindlers
who
employ
smaller
ones
called
revs
tetu
baillargeon
chiniquy
parent
to
fill
their
treasuries
but
if
you
want
to
know
my
mind
on
that
delicate
subject
i
will
tell
you
that
the
least
we
think
and
speak
of
it
the
better
it
is
for
us
every
time
my
thoughts
turn
to
those
streams
of
money
which
day
and
night
flow
from
the
small
purses
of
our
pious
and
unsuspecting
people
into
our
hands
and
from
ours
into
those
of
the
bishops
i
feel
as
if
i
were
choking
if
i
am
at
the
table
i
can
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
if
in
my
bed
at
night
i
can
not
sleep
but
as
i
like
to
eat
drink
and
sleep
i
reject
those
thoughts
as
much
as
possible
and
i
advise
you
to
do
the
same
the
other
vicars
seemed
inclined
with
parent
to
accept
that
conclusion
but
as
i
had
not
said
a
single
word
they
requested
me
to
give
them
my
views
on
that
vexatious
subject
which
i
did
in
the
following
brief
words
there
are
many
things
in
our
holy
church
which
look
like
dark
spots
but
i
hope
that
this
is
due
only
to
our
ignorance
no
doubt
these
very
things
would
look
as
white
as
snow
were
we
to
see
and
know
them
just
as
they
are
our
holy
bishops
with
the
majority
of
the
catholic
priests
of
the
united
states
and
canada
can
not
be
that
band
of
thieves
and
swindlers
whose
phantoms
chill
the
blood
of
our
worthy
curate
so
long
as
we
do
not
know
what
the
bishops
do
with
those
numberless
masses
paid
into
their
hands
i
prefer
to
believe
that
they
act
as
honest
i
had
hardly
said
these
few
words
when
i
was
called
to
visit
a
sick
parishioner
and
the
conversation
was
ended
eight
days
later
i
was
alone
in
my
room
reading
the
l
ami
de
la
religion
et
du
roi
a
paper
which
i
received
from
paris
edited
by
picot
my
curiosity
was
not
a
little
excited
when
i
read
at
the
head
of
a
page
in
large
letters
admirable
piety
of
the
french
canadian
the
reading
of
that
page
made
me
shed
tears
of
shame
and
shook
my
faith
to
its
foundation
unable
to
contain
myself
i
ran
to
the
rooms
of
the
curate
and
the
vicars
and
said
to
them
a
few
days
ago
we
tried
but
in
vain
to
find
what
becomes
of
the
large
sums
of
money
which
pass
from
the
people
through
our
hands
into
those
of
the
bishop
to
say
masses
but
here
is
the
answer
i
have
the
key
to
that
mystery
which
is
worthy
of
the
darkest
ages
of
the
church
i
wish
i
were
dead
rather
than
see
with
my
own
eyes
such
we
then
read
that
long
chapter
the
substance
of
which
was
that
the
venerable
bishops
of
quebec
had
sent
not
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
francs
at
different
times
to
the
priests
of
paris
that
they
might
say
four
hundred
thousand
masses
at
five
cents
each
here
we
had
the
sad
evidence
that
our
bishops
had
taken
four
hundred
thousand
francs
from
our
poor
people
under
the
pretext
of
saving
the
souls
from
purgatory
that
article
fell
upon
us
as
a
thunderbolt
for
a
long
time
we
looked
at
each
other
without
being
able
to
utter
a
single
word
our
tongues
were
as
paralyzed
by
our
shame
we
felt
as
vile
criminals
when
detected
on
the
spot
at
last
baillargeon
addressing
the
curate
said
is
it
possible
that
our
bishops
are
swindlers
and
we
their
tools
to
defraud
our
people
what
would
that
people
say
if
they
knew
that
not
only
we
do
not
say
the
masses
for
which
they
constantly
fill
our
hands
with
their
money
but
that
we
send
those
masses
to
be
said
in
paris
for
five
cents
what
will
our
good
people
think
of
us
all
when
they
know
that
our
bishop
pockets
twenty
cents
out
of
each
mass
they
ask
us
to
celebrate
according
to
their
the
curate
answered
it
is
very
lucky
that
the
people
do
not
know
that
sharp
operation
of
our
bishops
for
they
would
surely
throw
us
all
into
the
river
let
us
keep
that
shameful
trade
as
secret
as
possible
for
what
is
the
crime
of
simony
if
this
be
not
an
instance
of
it
i
replied
how
can
you
hope
to
keep
that
traffic
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
a
secret
when
not
less
than
copies
of
this
paper
are
circulated
in
france
and
more
than
copies
come
to
the
united
states
and
canada
the
danger
is
greater
than
you
suspect
it
is
even
at
our
doors
is
it
not
on
account
of
such
public
and
undeniable
crimes
and
vile
tricks
of
the
clergy
of
france
that
the
french
people
in
general
not
only
have
lost
almost
every
vestige
of
religion
but
not
half
a
century
ago
condemned
all
the
priests
and
bishops
of
france
to
death
as
public
malefactors
but
that
sharp
mercantile
operation
of
our
bishops
takes
a
still
darker
color
when
we
consider
that
those
masses
which
are
said
in
paris
are
not
worth
a
cent
for
who
among
us
is
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
greatest
part
of
the
priests
of
paris
are
infidels
and
that
many
of
them
live
publicly
with
concubines
would
our
people
put
their
money
in
our
hands
if
we
were
honest
enough
to
tell
them
that
their
masses
would
be
said
for
five
cents
in
paris
by
such
priests
do
we
not
deceive
them
when
we
accept
their
money
under
the
well
understood
condition
that
we
shall
offer
the
holy
sacrifice
according
to
their
wishes
but
instead
of
that
we
get
it
sent
to
france
to
be
disposed
of
in
such
a
criminal
way
but
if
you
allow
me
to
speak
a
little
more
i
have
another
strange
fact
to
consider
with
you
which
is
closely
connected
with
this
simonical
yes
speak
speak
answered
all
four
priests
i
then
resumed
do
you
remember
how
you
were
enticed
into
the
three
masses
society
who
among
us
had
the
idea
that
the
new
obligations
we
were
then
assuming
were
such
that
the
greatest
part
of
the
year
would
be
spent
in
saying
masses
for
the
priests
and
that
it
would
thus
become
impossible
to
satisfy
the
pious
demands
of
the
people
who
support
us
we
already
belonged
to
the
societies
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
and
of
michael
which
raised
to
five
the
number
of
masses
we
had
to
celebrate
for
the
dead
priests
dazzled
by
the
idea
that
we
would
have
two
thousand
masses
said
for
us
at
our
death
we
bit
at
the
bait
presented
to
us
by
the
bishop
as
hungry
fishes
without
suspecting
the
hook
the
result
is
that
we
have
had
to
say
masses
for
the
priests
who
died
during
the
past
year
which
means
that
each
of
us
has
to
pay
to
the
bishop
for
masses
which
he
has
had
said
in
paris
for
each
mass
which
we
celebrate
for
a
dead
priest
here
is
a
mass
which
the
bishop
sends
to
paris
on
which
he
gains
twenty
cents
then
the
more
priests
he
enrolls
in
his
society
of
three
masses
the
more
twenty
cents
he
pockets
from
us
and
from
our
pious
people
hence
his
admirable
zeal
to
enroll
every
one
of
us
it
is
not
the
value
of
the
money
which
our
bishop
so
skilfully
got
from
our
hands
which
i
consider
but
i
feel
desolate
when
i
see
that
by
these
societies
we
become
the
accomplices
of
his
simonical
trade
for
being
forced
the
greatest
part
of
the
year
to
celebrate
the
holy
sacrifice
for
the
benefit
of
the
dead
priests
we
can
not
celebrate
the
masses
for
which
we
are
daily
paid
by
the
people
and
are
therefore
forced
to
transfer
them
into
the
hands
of
the
bishop
who
sends
them
to
paris
after
spiriting
away
twenty
cents
from
each
of
them
however
why
should
we
lament
over
the
past
it
is
no
more
within
our
reach
there
is
no
remedy
for
it
let
us
then
learn
from
the
past
errors
how
to
be
wise
in
the
tetu
answered
you
have
shown
us
our
error
now
can
you
indicate
any
remedy
i
can
not
say
that
the
remedy
we
have
in
hand
is
one
of
those
patented
medicines
which
will
cure
all
the
diseases
of
our
sickly
church
in
canada
but
i
hope
it
will
help
to
bring
a
speedy
convalescence
that
remedy
is
to
abolish
the
society
of
three
masses
and
to
establish
another
of
one
mass
which
will
be
said
at
the
death
of
every
priest
in
that
way
it
is
true
that
instead
of
masses
we
shall
have
only
at
our
death
but
if
masses
do
not
open
to
us
the
gates
of
heaven
it
is
because
we
shall
be
in
hell
by
that
reduction
we
shall
be
enabled
to
say
more
masses
at
the
request
of
our
people
and
shall
diminish
the
number
of
masses
said
by
the
priests
of
paris
at
the
request
of
our
bishop
if
you
take
my
advice
we
will
immediately
name
the
rev
tetu
president
of
the
new
society
parent
will
be
its
treasurer
and
i
consent
to
act
as
your
secretary
if
you
like
it
when
our
society
is
organized
we
will
send
our
resignations
to
the
president
of
the
other
society
and
we
shall
immediately
address
a
circular
to
all
the
priests
to
give
them
the
reason
for
the
change
and
respectfully
ask
them
to
unite
with
us
in
this
new
society
in
order
to
diminish
the
number
of
masses
which
are
celebrated
by
the
priests
of
within
two
hours
the
new
society
was
fully
organized
the
reasons
of
its
formation
written
in
a
book
and
our
names
were
sent
to
the
bishop
with
a
respectful
letter
informing
him
that
we
were
no
more
members
of
the
three
masses
that
letter
was
signed
c
chiniquy
three
hours
later
i
received
the
following
note
from
the
bishop
s
palace
my
lord
bishop
of
quebec
wants
to
see
you
immediately
upon
important
affairs
do
not
fail
to
come
without
delay
truly
yours
charles
cazeault
sec
i
showed
the
missive
to
the
curate
and
the
vicars
and
told
them
a
big
storm
is
raging
on
the
mountain
this
is
the
first
peal
of
atmosphere
looks
dark
and
heavy
pray
for
me
that
i
may
speak
and
act
as
an
honest
and
fearless
priest
when
in
the
presence
of
the
in
the
first
parlor
of
the
bishop
s
palace
i
met
my
personal
friend
secretary
cazeault
he
said
to
me
my
dear
chiniquy
you
are
sailing
on
a
rough
must
be
a
lucky
mariner
if
you
escape
the
wreck
the
bishop
is
very
angry
at
you
but
be
not
discouraged
for
the
right
is
on
your
he
then
kindly
opened
the
door
of
the
bishop
s
parlor
and
said
my
lord
chiniquy
is
here
waiting
for
your
let
him
come
sir
answered
the
bishop
i
entered
and
threw
myself
at
his
feet
as
it
is
the
usage
of
the
priests
but
stepping
backward
he
told
me
in
a
most
excited
manner
i
have
no
benediction
for
you
till
you
give
me
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
your
strange
i
arose
to
my
feet
and
said
my
lord
what
do
you
want
from
me
i
want
you
sir
to
explain
to
me
the
meaning
of
this
letter
signed
by
you
as
secretary
of
a
society
called
one
mass
at
the
same
time
he
showed
me
my
letter
i
answered
him
my
lord
the
letter
is
in
good
lordship
must
have
understood
it
well
i
can
not
see
how
any
explanation
on
my
part
could
make
it
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
what
you
mean
and
what
is
your
object
in
leaving
the
old
and
respectable
three
masses
society
is
it
not
composed
of
your
bishops
and
of
all
the
priests
of
canada
did
you
not
find
yourself
in
sufficiently
good
company
do
you
object
to
the
prayers
said
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
i
replied
my
lord
i
will
answer
by
revealing
to
your
lordship
a
fact
which
has
not
sufficiently
attracted
your
attention
the
great
number
of
masses
which
we
have
to
say
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
priests
makes
it
impossible
for
us
to
say
the
masses
for
which
the
people
pay
into
our
hands
we
are
then
forced
to
transfer
this
money
into
your
hands
and
then
instead
of
having
these
holy
sacrifices
offered
by
the
good
priests
of
canada
your
lordship
has
recourse
to
the
priests
of
france
where
you
get
them
said
for
five
cents
we
see
two
great
evils
in
this
masses
are
said
by
priests
in
whom
we
have
not
the
least
confidence
and
though
the
masses
they
say
are
very
cheap
they
are
too
dearly
purchased
for
between
you
and
me
we
can
say
that
with
very
few
exceptions
the
masses
said
by
the
priests
of
france
particularly
of
paris
are
not
worth
one
cent
the
second
evil
is
still
greater
for
in
our
eyes
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
which
our
holy
church
has
always
condemned
the
crime
of
do
you
mean
to
say
indignantly
replied
the
bishop
that
i
am
guilty
of
the
crime
of
simony
yes
my
lord
it
is
just
what
i
mean
to
say
and
i
do
not
see
how
your
lordship
does
not
understand
that
the
trade
in
masses
by
which
you
gain
francs
on
a
spiritual
merchandise
which
you
get
for
is
not
you
insult
me
you
are
the
most
impudent
man
i
ever
saw
if
you
do
not
retract
what
you
have
said
i
will
suspend
and
excommunicate
you
my
suspension
and
my
excommunication
will
not
make
the
position
of
your
lordship
much
better
for
the
people
will
know
that
you
have
excommunicated
me
because
i
protested
against
your
trade
in
masses
they
will
know
that
you
pocket
twenty
cents
on
every
mass
and
that
you
get
them
said
for
five
cents
in
paris
by
priests
the
greatest
part
of
whom
live
with
concubines
and
you
will
see
that
there
will
be
only
one
voice
in
canada
to
bless
me
for
my
protest
and
to
condemn
you
for
your
simoniacal
trade
on
such
a
sacred
thing
as
the
holy
and
tremendous
sacrifice
of
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
i
uttered
these
words
with
such
perfect
calmness
that
the
bishop
saw
that
i
had
not
the
least
fear
of
his
thunders
he
began
to
pace
the
room
and
he
heaped
on
my
devoted
head
all
the
epithets
by
which
i
could
learn
that
i
was
an
insolent
rebellious
and
dangerous
priest
it
is
evident
to
me
said
he
that
you
aim
to
be
a
reformer
a
luther
petit
in
canada
but
you
will
never
be
anything
else
than
a
monkey
i
saw
that
my
bishop
was
beside
himself
and
that
my
perfect
calmness
added
to
his
irritation
i
answered
him
if
luther
had
never
done
anything
worse
than
i
do
he
ought
to
be
blessed
by
god
and
man
i
respectfully
request
your
lordship
to
be
calm
the
subject
on
which
i
speak
to
you
is
more
serious
than
you
think
your
lordship
by
asking
cents
for
a
mass
which
can
be
said
for
five
cents
does
a
thing
which
you
would
condemn
if
it
were
done
by
another
man
you
are
digging
under
your
own
feet
and
under
the
feet
of
your
priests
the
same
abyss
in
which
the
church
of
france
nearly
perished
not
half
a
century
ago
you
are
destroying
with
your
own
hands
every
vestige
of
religion
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
who
will
sooner
or
later
know
it
i
am
your
best
friend
your
most
respectful
priest
when
i
fearlessly
tell
you
this
truth
before
it
is
too
late
your
lordship
knows
that
he
has
not
a
priest
who
loves
and
cherishes
him
more
than
i
knows
it
is
because
i
love
and
respect
you
as
my
own
father
that
i
profoundly
deplore
the
illusions
which
prevent
you
from
seeing
the
terrible
consequences
that
will
follow
if
our
pious
people
learn
that
you
abuse
their
ignorance
and
their
good
faith
by
making
them
pay
cents
for
a
thing
which
costs
only
five
woe
to
your
lordship
woe
to
me
woe
to
our
holy
church
the
day
that
our
people
know
that
in
our
holy
religion
the
blood
of
christ
is
turned
into
merchandise
to
fill
the
treasury
of
the
bishops
and
pope
it
was
evident
that
these
last
words
said
with
most
perfect
had
not
all
been
lost
the
bishop
had
become
calmer
he
answered
me
you
are
young
and
without
experience
your
imagination
is
easily
fed
with
phantoms
when
you
know
a
little
more
you
will
change
your
mind
and
will
have
more
respect
for
your
superiors
i
hope
your
present
error
is
only
a
momentary
one
i
could
punish
you
for
this
freedom
with
which
you
have
dared
to
speak
to
your
bishop
but
i
prefer
to
warn
you
to
be
more
respectful
and
obedient
in
future
though
i
deplore
for
your
sake
that
you
have
requested
me
to
take
away
your
name
from
the
three
masses
society
you
and
the
four
simpletons
who
have
committed
the
same
act
of
folly
are
the
only
losers
in
the
matter
instead
of
two
thousand
masses
said
for
the
deliverance
of
your
souls
from
the
flames
of
purgatory
you
will
have
only
twelve
hundred
but
be
sure
of
it
there
is
too
much
wisdom
and
true
piety
in
my
clergy
to
follow
your
example
you
will
be
left
alone
and
i
fear
covered
with
ridicule
for
they
will
call
you
the
little
i
answered
the
bishop
i
am
young
it
is
true
but
the
truths
i
have
said
to
your
lordship
are
as
old
as
the
gospel
i
have
such
confidence
in
the
infinite
merits
of
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
that
i
sincerely
believe
that
twelve
hundred
masses
said
by
good
priests
are
enough
to
cleanse
my
soul
and
extinguish
the
flames
of
purgatory
but
besides
i
prefer
twelve
hundred
masses
said
by
one
hundred
sincere
canadian
priests
to
a
million
said
by
the
priests
of
these
last
words
spoken
with
a
tone
half
serious
half
jocose
brought
a
change
on
the
face
of
my
bishop
i
thought
it
was
a
good
moment
to
get
my
benediction
and
take
leave
of
him
i
took
my
hat
knelt
at
his
feet
obtained
his
blessing
and
left
chapter
xxvi
continuation
of
the
trade
in
masses
the
hour
of
my
absence
had
been
one
of
anxiety
for
the
curate
and
the
vicars
but
my
prompt
return
filled
them
with
joy
what
news
they
all
exclaimed
good
news
i
answered
the
battle
has
been
fierce
but
short
we
have
gained
the
day
and
if
we
are
only
true
to
ourselves
another
great
victory
is
in
store
for
us
the
bishop
is
so
sure
that
we
are
the
only
ones
who
think
of
that
reform
that
he
will
not
move
a
finger
to
prevent
the
other
priests
from
following
us
this
security
will
make
our
success
infallible
but
we
must
not
lose
a
moment
let
us
address
our
circular
to
every
priest
in
one
hour
later
there
were
more
than
twenty
writers
at
work
and
before
hours
more
than
three
hundred
letters
were
carried
to
all
the
priests
giving
them
the
reasons
why
we
should
try
by
all
fair
means
to
put
an
end
to
the
shameful
simoniacal
trade
in
masses
which
was
going
on
between
canada
and
france
the
week
was
scarcely
ended
when
letters
came
from
nearly
all
the
curates
and
vicars
to
the
bishop
respectfully
requesting
him
to
withdraw
his
name
from
the
society
of
the
three
only
fifty
refused
to
comply
with
our
request
our
victory
was
more
complete
than
we
had
expected
but
the
bishop
of
quebec
hoping
to
regain
his
lost
ground
immediately
wrote
to
the
bishop
of
montreal
my
lord
telemesse
to
come
to
his
help
and
show
us
the
enormity
of
the
crime
we
had
committed
in
rebelling
against
the
will
of
our
ecclesiastical
superiors
a
few
days
later
to
my
great
dismay
i
received
a
short
and
very
cold
note
from
the
bishop
s
secretary
telling
me
that
their
lordships
the
bishops
of
montreal
and
quebec
wanted
to
see
me
at
the
palace
without
delay
i
had
never
seen
the
bishop
of
montreal
and
my
surprise
and
disappointment
were
great
in
finding
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
my
idea
of
whom
was
of
gigantic
proportions
when
in
reality
he
was
very
small
but
i
felt
exceedingly
well
pleased
by
the
admirable
mixture
of
firmness
intelligence
and
honesty
of
his
whole
demeanor
his
eyes
were
piercing
as
the
eagle
s
but
when
fixed
on
me
i
saw
in
them
the
marks
of
a
noble
and
honest
heart
the
motions
of
his
head
were
rapid
his
sentences
short
and
he
seemed
to
know
only
one
straight
approaching
a
subject
or
dealing
with
a
man
he
had
the
merited
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
learned
and
eloquent
men
of
canada
the
bishop
of
quebec
had
remained
on
his
sofa
and
left
the
bishop
of
montreal
to
receive
me
i
fell
at
his
feet
and
asked
his
blessing
which
he
gave
me
in
the
most
cordial
way
then
putting
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
he
said
in
a
quaker
style
is
it
possible
that
art
young
priest
who
makes
so
much
noise
how
can
such
a
small
man
make
so
much
noise
there
being
a
smile
on
his
countenance
as
he
uttered
these
words
i
saw
at
once
that
there
was
no
anger
or
bad
feeling
in
his
heart
i
replied
my
lord
do
you
not
know
that
the
most
precious
pearls
and
perfumes
are
put
up
in
the
smallest
vases
the
bishop
saw
that
this
was
a
compliment
to
his
address
he
smilingly
replied
well
well
if
thou
art
a
noisy
priest
thou
art
not
a
fool
but
tell
me
why
dost
thou
want
to
destroy
our
three
mass
society
and
establish
that
new
one
on
its
ruins
in
spite
of
thy
superiors
my
lord
my
answer
will
be
as
respectful
short
and
plain
as
possible
i
have
left
the
three
mass
society
because
it
was
my
right
to
do
it
without
anybody
s
permission
i
hope
our
venerable
canadian
bishops
do
not
wish
to
be
served
by
slaves
i
do
not
say
replied
the
bishop
that
thou
wert
bound
in
conscience
to
remain
in
the
three
mass
society
but
can
i
know
why
thou
hast
left
such
a
respectable
association
at
the
head
of
which
thou
seest
thy
bishops
and
the
most
venerable
priests
in
canada
i
will
again
be
plain
in
my
answer
my
lord
if
your
lordship
wants
to
go
to
hell
with
your
venerable
priests
by
spiriting
away
twenty
cents
from
every
one
of
our
honest
and
pious
penitents
for
masses
which
you
get
said
for
five
by
bad
priests
in
paris
i
will
not
follow
you
moreover
if
your
lordship
wants
to
be
thrown
into
the
river
by
the
furious
people
when
they
know
how
long
and
how
cunningly
we
have
cheated
them
with
our
simoniacal
trade
in
masses
i
do
not
want
to
follow
you
into
the
cold
well
well
answered
the
bishop
let
us
drop
that
matter
he
uttered
this
short
sentence
with
such
an
evidence
of
sincerity
and
honesty
that
i
saw
he
really
meant
it
he
had
at
a
glance
seen
that
his
ground
was
untenable
in
the
presence
of
priests
who
knew
their
rights
and
had
a
mind
to
stand
by
them
my
joy
was
great
indeed
at
such
a
prompt
and
complete
victory
i
again
fell
at
the
bishop
s
feet
and
asked
his
benediction
before
taking
leave
of
him
i
then
left
to
go
and
tell
the
curates
and
vicars
the
happy
issue
of
my
interview
with
the
bishop
of
montreal
from
that
time
till
now
at
the
death
of
every
priest
the
clerical
press
never
failed
mentioning
whether
the
deceased
priest
belonged
to
the
three
or
one
mass
we
had
to
some
extent
diminished
the
simoniacal
and
infamous
trade
in
masses
but
unfortunately
we
had
not
destroyed
it
and
i
know
that
it
has
revived
since
i
left
the
church
of
rome
the
bishops
of
quebec
have
raised
the
three
mass
society
from
its
grave
it
is
a
public
fact
that
no
priest
dare
deny
that
the
trade
in
masses
is
still
conducted
on
a
large
scale
with
france
there
are
in
paris
and
other
large
cities
in
that
country
public
agencies
to
carry
on
that
shameful
traffic
it
is
generally
in
the
hands
of
booksellers
or
merchants
of
church
ornaments
every
year
their
houses
send
a
large
number
of
prospectuses
through
france
and
belgium
and
other
catholic
countries
in
which
they
say
that
in
order
to
help
the
priests
who
having
received
money
for
their
masses
don
t
know
where
to
have
them
said
they
offer
a
premium
of
or
thirty
per
cent
to
those
who
will
send
them
the
surplus
of
the
money
they
have
in
hand
to
offer
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
the
priests
who
have
such
surplus
tempted
by
that
premium
which
is
usually
paid
with
a
watch
or
chain
or
a
chalice
disgorge
a
part
or
the
whole
of
the
large
sums
they
possess
into
the
hands
of
the
pious
merchants
who
take
this
money
and
use
it
as
they
please
but
they
never
pay
the
masses
in
money
they
give
only
merchandise
for
instance
that
priest
will
receive
a
watch
if
he
promises
to
celebrate
one
or
two
hundred
masses
or
a
chalice
to
celebrate
three
or
four
hundred
masses
i
have
here
in
hand
several
of
the
contracts
or
promissory
notes
sent
by
those
merchants
of
masses
to
the
priests
the
public
will
no
doubt
read
the
following
documents

were

hence
it
is
that
priests
in
france
and
elsewhere
have
gold
watches
rich
house
furniture
and
interesting
books
purchased
with
the
money
paid
by
our
poor
deluded
canadian
catholics
to
their
priests
for
masses
which
are
turned
into
mercantile
commodities
in
other
places
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
who
makes
the
best
bargain
between
those
merchants
of
masses
the
priests
to
whom
they
are
sold
or
those
from
whom
they
are
bought
at
a
discount
of
to
thirty
per
cent
the
only
evident
thing
is
the
cruel
deception
practiced
on
the
credulity
and
ignorance
of
the
roman
catholics
by
their
priests
and
bishops
the
houses
of
anthony
levesques
in
paris
are
the
most
accredited
in
france
in
the
house
of
mesme
was
doing
an
immense
business
with
its
stock
of
masses
but
in
an
evil
day
the
government
suspected
that
the
number
of
masses
paid
into
their
hands
exceeded
the
number
of
those
celebrated
through
their
hired
priests
the
suspicion
soon
turned
into
certainty
when
the
books
were
examined
it
was
then
found
that
an
incredible
number
of
masses
which
were
to
empty
the
large
room
of
purgatory
never
reached
their
destination
but
only
filled
the
purse
of
the
parisian
mass
merchant
and
so
the
unlucky
mesme
was
unceremoniously
sent
to
the
penitentiary
to
meditate
on
the
infinite
merits
of
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
which
had
been
engulfed
in
his
treasures
but
these
facts
are
not
known
by
the
poor
roman
catholics
of
canada
who
are
fleeced
more
and
more
by
their
priests
under
the
pretext
of
saving
souls
from
purgatory
a
new
element
of
success
in
the
large
swindling
operations
of
the
canadian
priests
has
lately
been
discovered
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
greater
part
of
the
united
states
the
poor
deluded
irish
pay
one
dollar
to
their
priest
instead
of
a
shilling
for
a
low
mass
those
priests
whose
conscience
are
sufficiently
elastic
as
is
often
the
case
keep
the
money
without
ever
thinking
of
having
the
masses
said
and
soon
get
rich
but
there
are
some
whose
natural
honesty
shrinks
from
the
idea
of
stealing
but
unable
to
celebrate
all
the
masses
paid
for
and
requested
at
their
hands
they
send
the
dollars
to
some
of
their
clerical
friends
in
canada
who
of
course
prefer
these
one
dollar
masses
to
the
cent
ones
paid
by
the
french
canadians
however
they
keep
that
secret
and
continue
to
fill
their
treasury
there
are
however
many
priests
in
canada
who
think
it
less
evil
to
keep
those
large
sums
of
money
in
their
own
hands
than
to
give
them
to
the
bishops
to
traffic
with
the
merchants
of
paris
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
ecclesiastical
retreats
in
the
seminary
of
sulpice
in
bishop
bourget
told
us
that
one
of
the
priests
who
had
lately
died
had
requested
him
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
to
ask
every
priest
to
take
a
share
in
the
which
he
had
received
for
masses
he
had
never
said
we
refused
to
grant
him
that
favor
and
those
received
by
that
priest
like
the
millions
put
into
the
hands
of
other
priests
and
the
bishops
turned
to
be
nothing
less
than
an
infamous
swindling
operation
under
the
mask
of
religion
to
understand
what
the
priests
of
rome
are
let
the
readers
note
what
is
said
in
the
roman
catholic
bible
of
the
priest
of
babylon
and
king
astyges
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
cyrus
of
persia
received
his
kingdom
and
daniel
conversed
with
the
king
and
was
honored
above
all
his
friends
now
the
babylonians
had
an
idol
called
bel
and
there
were
spent
upon
him
every
day
twelve
measures
of
fine
flour
and
forty
sheep
and
six
vessels
of
wine
and
the
king
worshipped
it
and
went
daily
to
adore
but
daniel
worshipped
his
own
god
and
the
king
said
unto
him
why
dost
thou
not
worship
bel
who
answered
and
said
because
i
may
not
worship
idols
made
with
hands
but
the
living
god
who
hath
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
hath
sovereignty
over
all
then
the
king
said
thinkest
thou
not
that
bel
is
a
living
god
seest
thou
not
how
much
he
eateth
and
drinketh
every
day
then
daniel
smiled
and
said
oh
king
be
not
deceived
for
this
is
but
clay
within
and
brass
without
and
did
never
eat
or
drink
so
the
king
was
wroth
and
called
for
his
priests
and
said
if
ye
tell
me
not
who
this
is
that
devoureth
these
expenses
ye
shall
die
but
if
ye
can
certify
me
that
bel
devoureth
them
then
daniel
shall
die
for
he
has
spoken
blasphemy
against
and
daniel
said
unto
the
king
let
it
be
according
to
thy
now
the
priests
of
bel
were
three
score
and
ten
besides
their
wives
and
children
and
the
king
went
with
daniel
to
the
temple
of
bel
s
priests
said
lo
we
got
out
but
thou
o
king
set
on
the
meat
and
make
ready
the
wine
and
shut
the
door
fast
and
seal
it
with
thine
own
signet
and
when
thou
comest
in
if
thou
findest
not
that
bel
hath
eaten
up
all
we
will
suffer
death
or
else
daniel
that
speaketh
falsely
against
bel
shall
they
little
regarded
it
for
under
the
table
they
had
made
a
privy
entrance
whereby
they
entered
continually
and
consumed
those
so
when
they
were
gone
forth
the
king
set
meats
before
bel
now
daniel
had
commanded
his
servants
to
bring
ashes
and
those
they
strewed
throughout
all
the
temple
in
the
presence
of
the
king
alone
then
they
went
out
and
shut
the
door
and
sealed
it
with
the
king
s
signet
and
so
departed
now
in
the
night
came
the
priests
with
their
wives
and
children
as
they
were
wont
to
do
and
did
eat
and
drink
up
all
in
the
morning
betimes
the
king
arose
and
daniel
with
him
and
the
king
said
daniel
are
the
seals
whole
and
he
said
yea
o
king
they
be
and
as
soon
as
they
had
opened
the
door
the
king
looked
upon
the
table
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
great
art
thou
o
bel
and
with
thee
there
is
no
deceit
at
then
laughed
daniel
and
held
the
king
that
he
should
not
go
in
and
said
behold
now
the
pavement
and
mark
well
whose
footsteps
are
and
the
king
said
i
see
the
footsteps
of
men
women
and
and
then
the
king
was
angry
and
took
the
priests
with
their
wives
and
children
who
showed
him
the
privy
doors
where
they
came
in
and
consumed
such
things
as
were
on
the
tables
therefore
the
king
slew
them
and
delivered
bel
into
daniel
s
power
who
destroyed
him
and
his
who
does
not
pity
the
king
of
babylon
who
when
looking
at
his
clay
and
brass
god
exclaimed
great
art
thou
o
bel
and
with
thee
there
is
no
deceit
but
is
the
deception
practiced
by
the
priests
of
the
pope
on
their
poor
deluded
dupes
less
cruel
and
infamous
where
is
the
difference
between
that
babylonian
god
made
with
brass
and
baked
clay
and
the
god
of
the
roman
catholics
made
with
a
handful
of
wheat
and
flour
baked
between
two
hot
polished
irons
how
skilful
were
the
priests
in
keeping
the
secret
of
what
became
of
the
rich
daily
offerings
brought
to
the
hungry
god
who
could
suspect
that
there
was
a
secret
trap
through
which
they
came
with
their
wives
and
children
to
eat
the
rich
offerings
so
among
the
simple
and
blind
roman
catholics
who
could
suppose
that
the
immense
sums
of
money
given
every
day
to
the
priests
to
glorify
god
purify
the
souls
of
men
and
bring
all
kinds
of
blessings
upon
the
donors
were
on
the
contrary
turned
into
the
most
ignominious
and
swindling
operation
the
world
has
ever
seen
though
the
brass
god
of
babylon
was
a
contemptible
idol
is
not
the
wafer
god
of
rome
still
more
so
though
the
priests
of
bel
were
skilful
deceivers
are
they
not
surpassed
in
the
art
of
deception
by
the
priests
of
rome
do
not
these
carry
on
their
operations
on
a
much
larger
scale
than
the
former
but
as
there
is
always
a
day
of
retribution
for
the
great
iniquities
of
this
world
when
all
things
will
be
revealed
and
just
as
the
cunning
of
the
priests
of
babylon
could
not
save
them
when
god
sent
his
prophet
to
take
away
the
mask
behind
which
they
deceived
their
people
so
let
the
priests
of
rome
know
that
god
will
sooner
or
later
send
his
prophet
who
will
tear
off
the
mask
behind
which
they
deceive
the
world
their
big
awkward
and
flat
feet
will
be
seen
and
exposed
and
the
very
people
whom
they
keep
prostrated
before
their
idols
crying
o
god
with
thee
there
is
no
deceit
at
all
will
become
the
instruments
of
the
justice
of
god
in
the
great
day
of
retribution

more
regularity
in
our
ministerial
labors
and
my
lot
gave
me
the
northeast
of
the
parish
which
contained
the
quebec
marine
hospital
the
number
of
sick
sailors
i
had
to
visit
almost
every
day
in
that
noble
institution
was
between
and
a
hundred
the
roman
catholic
chapel
with
its
beautiful
altar
was
not
yet
completed
it
was
only
in
that
i
could
persuade
the
hospital
authorities
to
fix
it
as
it
is
having
no
place
there
to
celebrate
mass
and
keep
the
holy
sacrament
i
soon
found
myself
in
presence
of
a
difficulty
which
at
first
seemed
to
me
of
a
grave
character
i
had
to
administer
the
viaticum
holy
communion
to
a
dying
sailor
as
every
one
knows
all
roman
catholics
are
bound
to
believe
that
by
the
consecration
the
wafer
is
transformed
into
the
body
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
hence
they
call
that
ceremony
porter
le
bon
dieu
au
malade
carry
the
good
god
to
the
sick
till
then
when
in
charlesborough
or
charles
i
with
the
rest
of
roman
catholic
priests
always
made
use
of
pomp
and
exterior
marks
of
supreme
respect
for
the
almighty
god
i
was
carrying
in
my
hands
to
the
dying
i
had
never
carried
the
good
god
without
being
accompanied
by
several
people
walking
or
riding
on
horseback
i
then
wore
a
white
surplice
over
my
long
black
robe
soutane
to
strike
the
people
with
awe
there
was
also
a
man
ringing
a
bell
before
me
all
along
the
way
to
announce
to
the
people
that
the
great
god
who
had
not
only
created
them
but
had
made
himself
man
to
save
them
by
dying
on
calvary
was
passing
by
that
they
had
to
fall
on
their
knees
in
their
houses
or
along
the
public
roads
or
in
their
fields
and
prostrate
themselves
and
adore
him
but
could
i
do
that
in
quebec
where
so
many
miserable
heretics
were
more
disposed
to
laugh
at
my
god
than
to
adore
him
in
my
zeal
and
sincere
faith
i
was
however
determined
to
dare
the
heretics
of
the
whole
world
and
to
expose
myself
to
their
insults
rather
than
give
up
the
exterior
marks
of
supreme
respect
and
adoration
which
were
due
to
my
god
everywhere
and
twice
i
carried
him
to
the
hospital
with
the
usual
solemnity
in
vain
my
curate
tried
to
persuade
me
to
change
my
mind
i
closed
my
ears
to
his
arguments
he
then
kindly
invited
me
to
go
with
him
to
the
bishop
s
palace
in
order
to
confer
with
him
on
that
grave
subject
how
can
i
express
my
dismay
when
the
bishop
told
me
with
a
levity
which
i
had
not
yet
observed
in
him
that
on
account
of
the
protestants
whom
we
had
to
meet
everywhere
it
was
better
to
make
our
god
travel
in
the
streets
of
he
added
in
a
high
and
jocose
tone
put
him
in
your
vest
pocket
as
do
the
rest
of
the
city
priests
carry
him
to
your
dying
patients
without
any
scruples
never
aim
at
being
a
reformer
and
doing
better
than
your
venerable
brethren
in
the
priesthood
we
must
not
forget
that
we
are
a
conquered
people
if
we
were
masters
we
would
carry
him
to
the
dying
with
the
public
honors
we
used
to
give
him
before
the
conquest
but
the
protestants
are
the
stronger
our
governor
is
a
protestant
as
well
as
our
queen
the
garrison
which
is
inside
the
walls
of
their
impregnable
citadel
is
composed
chiefly
of
protestants
according
to
the
laws
of
our
holy
church
we
have
the
right
to
punish
even
by
death
the
miserable
people
who
turn
into
ridicule
the
mysteries
of
our
holy
religion
but
though
we
have
that
right
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
enforce
it
we
must
then
bear
the
yoke
in
silence
after
all
it
is
our
god
himself
who
in
his
inscrutable
judgment
has
deprived
us
of
the
power
of
honoring
him
as
he
deserves
and
to
tell
you
my
whole
mind
as
plainly
as
possible
it
is
not
our
fault
but
his
own
doing
so
to
speak
if
we
are
forced
to
make
him
travel
through
our
streets
it
is
one
of
the
sad
results
of
the
victory
which
the
god
of
battles
gave
to
the
heretics
over
us
on
the
plains
of
abraham
if
in
his
good
providence
we
could
break
our
fetters
and
become
free
to
pass
again
the
laws
which
regulated
canada
before
the
conquest
to
prevent
the
heretics
from
settling
among
us
then
we
would
carry
him
as
we
used
to
do
in
those
happy
but
said
i
when
i
walk
in
the
streets
with
my
good
god
in
my
vest
pocket
what
will
i
do
if
i
meet
any
friend
who
wants
to
shake
hands
and
have
a
joke
with
me
the
bishop
laughed
and
answered
tell
your
friend
you
are
in
a
hurry
and
go
your
way
as
quickly
as
possible
but
if
there
is
no
help
have
your
talk
and
your
joke
with
him
without
any
scruple
of
conscience
the
important
point
in
this
delicate
matter
is
that
the
people
should
not
know
that
we
are
carrying
our
god
through
the
streets
for
this
knowledge
would
surely
shake
and
weaken
their
faith
the
common
people
are
more
than
we
think
kept
in
our
holy
church
by
the
impressing
ceremonies
of
our
processions
and
public
marks
of
respect
we
give
to
jesus
christ
when
we
carry
him
to
the
sick
for
the
people
are
more
easily
persuaded
by
what
they
see
with
their
eyes
and
touch
with
their
hands
than
by
what
they
hear
with
their
i
submitted
to
the
order
of
my
ecclesiastical
superior
but
i
would
not
be
honest
were
i
not
to
confess
that
i
lost
much
of
my
spiritual
joy
for
some
time
in
the
administration
of
the
viaticum
i
continued
to
believe
as
sincerely
as
i
could
but
the
laughing
words
and
light
tone
of
my
bishop
had
fallen
upon
my
soul
as
an
icy
cloud
the
jocose
way
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
what
i
had
been
taught
to
consider
as
the
most
awful
and
adorable
mystery
of
the
church
left
the
impression
on
my
mind
that
he
did
not
believe
one
iota
of
the
dogma
of
transubstantiation
and
in
spite
of
all
my
honest
efforts
to
get
rid
of
that
suspicion
it
grew
in
my
mind
every
time
i
met
him
to
talk
on
any
ministerial
subject
it
took
several
years
before
i
could
accustom
myself
to
carry
my
god
in
my
vest
pocket
as
the
other
priests
did
without
any
more
ceremony
than
with
a
piece
of
tobacco
so
long
as
i
was
walking
alone
i
felt
happy
i
could
then
silently
converse
with
my
saviour
and
give
him
all
the
expressions
of
my
love
and
adoration
it
was
my
custom
then
to
repeat
the
or
psalm
of
david
the
te
deum
or
some
other
beautiful
hymn
or
the
which
i
knew
by
heart
but
no
words
can
express
my
sadness
when
as
it
was
very
often
the
case
i
met
some
friends
forcing
me
to
shake
hands
with
them
and
began
one
of
those
idle
and
talks
so
common
everywhere
with
the
utmost
efforts
i
had
then
to
put
a
smiling
mask
on
my
face
in
order
to
conceal
the
expression
of
faith
which
are
infallibly
seen
in
spite
of
one
s
self
if
one
is
in
the
very
act
of
adoration
how
then
i
earnestly
cursed
the
day
when
my
country
had
fallen
under
the
yoke
of
protestants
whose
presence
in
quebec
prevented
me
from
following
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
how
many
times
did
i
pray
my
wafer
god
whom
i
was
personally
pressing
on
my
heart
to
grant
us
an
opportunity
to
break
those
fetters
and
destroy
forever
the
power
of
protestant
england
over
us
then
we
should
be
free
again
to
give
our
saviour
all
the
public
honors
which
were
to
due
his
majesty
then
we
should
put
in
force
the
laws
by
which
no
heretic
had
any
right
to
settle
and
live
in
canada
not
long
after
that
conversation
with
the
bishop
i
found
myself
in
a
circumstance
which
added
much
to
my
trouble
and
confusion
of
conscience
on
that
matter
there
was
then
in
quebec
a
merchant
who
had
honorably
raised
himself
from
a
state
of
poverty
to
the
first
rank
among
the
wealthy
merchants
of
canada
though
a
few
years
after
he
was
ruined
by
a
series
of
most
terrible
disasters
his
name
is
still
honored
in
canada
as
one
of
the
most
industrious
and
honest
merchants
of
our
young
country
his
name
was
james
buteau
he
had
built
a
magnificent
house
and
furnished
it
in
a
princely
style
in
order
to
celebrate
his
house
warming
in
a
becoming
style
he
invited
a
hundred
guests
from
the
elite
of
the
city
among
whom
were
all
the
priests
of
the
parishes
but
in
order
not
to
frighten
their
prudery
though
the
party
was
to
be
more
of
the
nature
of
a
ball
than
anything
else
buteau
had
given
it
the
modest
name
of
an
oyster
soiree
just
as
the
good
curate
tetu
with
his
cheerful
vicars
was
starting
a
messenger
met
us
at
the
door
to
say
that
parent
the
youngest
vicar
had
called
to
carry
the
good
god
to
a
dying
woman
parent
was
born
and
had
passed
his
whole
life
in
quebec
in
whose
seminary
he
had
gone
through
a
complete
and
brilliant
course
of
study
i
think
there
was
scarcely
a
funny
song
in
the
french
language
which
he
could
not
sing
with
a
cheerful
nature
he
was
the
delight
of
the
quebec
society
by
almost
every
member
of
which
he
was
personally
known
his
hair
was
constantly
perfumed
with
the
richest
pomade
and
the
most
precious
eaux
de
cologne
surrounded
him
with
an
atmosphere
of
the
sweetest
odors
with
all
these
qualities
and
privileges
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
was
the
confessor
la
of
the
young
ladies
of
quebec
the
bright
luminaries
which
hover
around
jupiter
are
not
more
exact
in
converging
toward
the
brilliant
star
than
those
pious
young
ladies
were
in
gathering
around
the
confessional
box
of
parent
every
week
or
fortnight
the
unexpected
announcement
of
a
call
to
the
deathbed
of
one
of
his
poorest
penitents
was
not
quite
the
most
desirable
thing
for
our
dear
young
friend
at
such
an
hour
but
he
knew
too
well
his
duty
to
grumble
he
said
to
us
go
before
me
and
tell
buteau
that
i
will
be
in
time
to
get
my
share
of
the
by
chance
the
sick
house
was
on
the
way
and
not
far
from
buteau
s
splendid
mansion
he
left
us
to
run
to
the
altar
and
take
the
good
god
with
him
we
started
for
the
soiree
but
not
without
sympathizing
with
our
dear
parent
who
would
lose
the
most
interesting
part
for
the
administration
of
the
viaticum
the
extreme
unction
with
the
giving
of
indulgences
articulo
and
the
exhortation
to
the
dying
and
the
people
gathered
from
the
neighborhood
to
witness
those
solemn
rites
could
not
take
much
less
than
three
quarters
or
even
an
hour
of
his
time
but
to
my
great
surprise
we
had
not
yet
been
ten
minutes
in
the
magnificent
parlor
of
our
host
when
i
saw
parent
who
like
a
newborn
butterfly
flying
from
flower
to
flower
was
running
from
lady
to
lady
joking
laughing
surpassing
himself
with
his
inimitable
lovely
and
refined
manners
i
said
to
myself
how
is
it
possible
that
he
has
so
quickly
got
rid
of
his
unpalatable
task
with
his
dying
penitent
and
i
wanted
an
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
him
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
on
that
point
but
it
was
pretty
late
in
the
evening
when
i
had
a
chance
to
say
to
him
we
all
feared
lest
your
dying
patient
might
deprive
us
of
the
pleasure
of
your
company
the
greater
part
of
the
soiree
oh
oh
answered
he
with
a
hearty
laugh
that
intelligent
woman
had
the
good
common
sense
to
die
just
two
minutes
before
i
entered
her
house
i
suppose
that
her
guardian
angel
knowing
all
about
this
incomparable
party
had
dispatched
the
good
soul
to
heaven
a
little
sooner
than
she
expected
in
my
i
could
not
but
smile
at
his
answer
which
was
given
in
a
manner
to
make
a
stone
laugh
but
said
i
what
have
you
done
with
the
good
god
you
carried
with
you
ah
ah
the
good
god
he
replied
in
a
jocose
and
subdued
tone
well
well
the
good
god
he
stands
very
still
in
my
vest
pocket
and
if
he
enjoys
this
princely
festivity
as
well
as
we
all
do
he
will
surely
thank
me
for
having
brought
him
here
even
but
do
not
say
a
word
of
his
presence
here
it
would
spoil
that
priest
who
was
only
one
year
younger
than
myself
was
one
of
my
dearest
friends
though
his
words
rather
smelt
of
the
unbeliever
and
blasphemer
i
preferred
to
attribute
them
to
the
sweet
champagne
he
had
drunk
than
to
a
real
want
of
faith
but
i
must
confess
that
though
i
had
laughed
very
heartily
at
first
his
last
utterance
pained
me
so
much
that
from
that
moment
to
the
end
of
the
soiree
i
felt
uneasy
and
confounded
my
firm
belief
that
my
saviour
jesus
christ
was
there
in
person
kept
a
prisoner
in
my
young
friend
s
vest
pocket
going
to
and
fro
from
one
young
lady
to
the
other
witnessing
the
constant
laughing
hearing
the
idle
words
the
light
and
funny
songs
made
my
whole
soul
shudder
and
my
heart
sunk
within
me
by
times
i
wished
i
could
fall
on
my
knees
to
adore
my
saviour
whom
i
believed
to
be
there
however
a
mysterious
voice
was
whispering
in
my
ear
are
you
not
a
fool
to
believe
that
you
can
make
a
god
with
a
wafer
and
that
jesus
christ
your
saviour
and
your
god
can
be
kept
a
prisoner
in
spite
of
himself
in
the
vest
pocket
of
a
man
do
you
not
see
that
your
friend
parent
who
has
much
more
brains
and
intelligence
than
you
does
not
believe
a
word
of
that
dogma
of
transubstantiation
have
you
forgotten
the
unbeliever
s
smile
which
you
saw
on
the
lips
of
the
bishop
himself
only
a
few
days
ago
was
not
that
laugh
the
infallible
proof
that
he
also
does
not
believe
a
particle
of
that
ridiculous
dogma
with
superhuman
effort
i
tried
and
succeeded
partly
to
stifle
that
voice
but
that
struggle
could
not
last
long
within
my
soul
without
leaving
its
exterior
marks
on
my
face
evidently
a
sad
cloud
was
over
my
eyes
for
several
of
my
most
respectable
friends
with
and
buteau
kindly
asked
if
i
were
sick
at
last
i
felt
so
confused
at
the
repetition
of
the
same
suggestion
by
so
many
that
i
felt
that
i
was
only
making
a
fool
of
myself
by
remaining
any
longer
in
their
midst
angry
with
myself
for
my
want
of
moral
strength
in
this
hour
of
trial
i
respectfully
asked
pardon
from
my
kind
host
for
leaving
their
party
before
the
end
on
account
of
a
sudden
indisposition
the
next
day
there
was
only
one
voice
in
quebec
saying
that
young
parent
had
been
the
lion
of
that
brilliant
soiree
and
that
the
poor
young
priest
chiniquy
had
been

a
special
providence
in
our
lives
particularly
was
this
apparent
in
the
casting
of
the
lots
by
which
i
became
the
first
chaplain
of
the
quebec
marine
hospital
after
the
other
vicars
had
congratulated
each
other
for
having
escaped
the
heavy
burden
of
work
and
responsibilities
connected
with
that
chaplaincy
they
kindly
gave
me
the
assurance
of
their
sympathies
for
what
they
called
my
bad
luck
in
thanking
them
for
their
kindly
feelings
i
confessed
that
this
occurrence
appeared
to
me
in
a
very
different
light
i
was
sure
that
god
had
directed
this
for
my
good
and
his
own
glory
and
i
was
right
in
the
beginning
of
november
a
slight
indisposition
having
kept
me
for
a
few
days
at
home
glackmayer
the
superintendent
of
the
hospital
came
to
tell
me
that
there
was
an
unusually
large
number
of
sick
left
by
the
fall
fleets
in
danger
of
death
who
were
day
and
night
calling
for
me
he
added
in
a
secret
way
that
there
were
several
cases
of
of
the
worst
type
that
several
had
already
died
and
many
were
dying
from
the
terrible
cholera
morbus
which
was
still
raging
among
the
sailors
this
sad
news
came
to
me
as
an
order
from
heaven
to
run
to
the
rescue
of
my
dear
sick
seamen
i
left
my
room
despite
my
physician
and
went
to
the
hospital
the
first
man
i
met
was
douglas
who
was
waiting
for
me
at
glackmayer
s
room
he
confirmed
what
i
had
known
before
of
the
number
of
sick
and
added
that
the
prevailing
diseases
were
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
douglas
who
was
one
of
the
founders
and
governors
of
the
hospital
had
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
ablest
surgeons
of
quebec
though
a
staunch
protestant
by
birth
and
profession
he
honored
me
with
his
confidence
and
friendship
from
the
first
day
we
met
i
may
say
i
have
never
known
a
nobler
heart
a
larger
mind
and
a
truer
philanthropist
after
thanking
him
for
the
useful
though
sad
intelligence
he
had
given
me
i
requested
glackmayer
to
give
me
a
glass
of
brandy
which
i
immediately
swallowed
what
are
you
doing
there
said
douglas
you
see
i
answered
i
have
drank
a
glass
of
excellent
but
please
tell
me
why
you
drank
that
because
it
is
a
good
preservative
against
the
pestilential
atmosphere
i
will
breathe
all
day
i
replied
i
will
have
to
hear
the
confessions
of
all
those
people
dying
from
or
cholera
and
breathe
the
putrid
air
which
is
around
their
pillows
does
not
common
sense
warn
me
to
take
some
precautions
against
the
contagion
is
it
possible
rejoined
he
that
a
man
for
whom
i
have
such
a
sincere
esteem
is
so
ignorant
of
the
deadly
workings
of
alcohol
in
the
human
frame
what
you
have
just
drank
is
nothing
but
poison
and
far
from
protecting
yourself
against
the
danger
you
are
now
much
more
exposed
to
it
than
before
you
drank
that
you
poor
protestants
i
answered
in
a
jocose
way
are
a
band
of
fanatics
with
your
extreme
doctrines
on
temperance
you
will
never
convert
me
to
your
views
on
that
subject
is
it
for
the
use
of
the
dogs
that
god
has
created
wine
and
brandy
no
it
is
for
the
use
of
men
who
drink
them
with
moderation
and
my
dear
chiniquy
you
are
joking
but
i
am
in
earnest
when
i
tell
you
that
you
have
poisoned
yourself
with
that
glass
of
brandy
replied
dr
douglas
if
good
wine
and
brandy
were
poisons
i
answered
you
would
be
long
ago
the
only
physician
in
quebec
for
you
are
the
only
one
of
the
medical
body
whom
i
know
to
be
an
abstainer
but
though
i
am
much
pleased
with
your
conversation
excuse
me
if
i
leave
you
to
visit
my
dear
sick
sailors
whose
cries
for
spiritual
help
ring
in
my
one
word
more
said
douglas
and
i
have
done
morning
we
will
make
the
autopsy
of
a
sailor
who
has
just
died
suddenly
here
have
you
any
objections
to
come
and
see
with
your
eyes
in
the
body
of
that
man
what
your
glass
of
brandy
has
done
in
your
own
body
no
sir
i
have
no
objection
to
see
that
i
replied
i
have
been
anxious
for
a
long
time
to
make
a
special
study
of
anatomy
it
will
be
my
first
lesson
i
can
not
get
it
from
a
better
i
then
shook
hands
with
him
and
went
to
my
patients
with
whom
i
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
the
better
part
of
the
night
fifty
of
them
wanted
to
make
general
confessions
of
all
the
sins
of
their
whole
lives
and
i
had
to
give
the
last
sacraments
to
who
were
dying
from
or
cholera
morbus
the
next
morning
i
was
at
the
appointed
hour
by
the
corpse
of
the
dead
man
when
douglas
kindly
gave
me
a
very
powerful
microscope
that
i
might
more
thoroughly
follow
the
ravages
of
alcohol
in
every
part
of
the
human
body
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
said
he
that
this
man
has
been
instantly
killed
by
a
glass
of
rum
which
he
drank
one
hour
before
he
fell
dead
that
rum
has
caused
the
rupture
of
the
aorta
the
big
vein
which
carries
the
blood
from
the
heart
while
talking
thus
the
knife
was
doing
its
work
so
quickly
that
the
horrible
spectacle
of
the
broken
artery
was
before
our
eyes
almost
as
the
last
word
fell
from
his
lips
look
here
said
the
doctor
all
along
the
artery
and
you
will
see
thousands
perhaps
millions
of
reddish
spots
which
are
as
many
holes
perforated
through
it
by
alcohol
just
as
the
musk
rats
of
the
mississippi
river
almost
every
spring
dig
little
holes
through
the
dams
which
keeps
the
powerful
river
within
its
natural
limits
and
cause
the
waters
to
break
through
the
little
holes
and
thus
carry
desolation
and
death
along
its
shores
so
alcohol
every
day
causes
the
sudden
death
of
thousands
of
victims
by
perforating
the
veins
and
opening
small
issues
through
which
the
blood
rushes
out
of
its
natural
limits
it
is
not
only
this
big
vein
which
alcohol
perforates
it
does
the
same
deadly
work
in
the
veins
of
the
lungs
and
the
whole
body
look
at
the
lungs
with
attention
and
count
if
you
can
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
reddish
dark
and
yellow
spots
and
little
ulcers
with
which
they
are
covered
every
one
of
them
is
the
work
of
alcohol
which
has
torn
and
cut
the
veins
and
caused
the
blood
to
go
out
of
its
canals
to
carry
corruption
and
death
all
over
these
marvelous
organs
alcohol
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
dare
say
it
is
the
most
dangerous
it
has
killed
more
men
than
all
the
other
poisons
together
alcohol
can
not
be
changed
or
assimilated
to
any
part
or
tissue
of
our
body
it
can
not
go
to
any
part
of
the
human
frame
without
bringing
disorder
and
death
to
it
for
it
can
not
in
any
possible
way
unite
with
any
part
of
our
body
the
water
we
drink
the
wholesome
food
and
bread
we
eat
by
the
laws
and
will
of
god
are
transformed
into
the
different
parts
of
the
body
to
which
they
are
sent
through
the
millions
of
small
canals
which
take
them
from
the
stomach
to
every
part
of
our
frame
when
the
water
has
been
drunk
or
the
bread
we
have
eaten
is
for
instance
sent
to
the
lungs
to
the
brain
the
nerves
the
muscles
the
it
goes
it
receives
if
i
can
so
speak
letters
of
citizenship
it
is
allowed
to
remain
there
in
peace
and
to
work
for
the
public
good
but
it
is
not
so
with
alcohol
the
very
moment
it
enters
the
stomach
it
more
or
less
brings
disorder
ruin
and
death
according
to
the
quantity
taken
the
stomach
refuses
to
take
it
and
makes
a
supreme
effort
to
violently
throw
it
out
either
through
the
mouth
or
by
indignantly
pushing
it
to
the
brain
or
into
the
numberless
tubes
by
which
it
discharges
its
contents
to
the
surface
through
all
the
tissues
but
will
alcohol
be
welcome
in
any
of
these
tubes
and
marvellous
canals
or
in
any
part
or
tissue
of
the
body
it
will
visit
on
its
passage
to
the
surface
no
look
here
with
your
microscope
and
you
will
see
with
your
own
eyes
that
everywhere
alcohol
has
gone
into
the
body
there
has
been
a
struggle
and
a
bloody
battle
fought
to
get
rid
of
it
yes
every
place
where
king
alcohol
has
put
his
foot
has
been
turned
into
a
battlefield
spread
with
ruin
and
death
in
order
to
ignominiously
turn
it
out
by
a
most
extraordinary
working
of
nature
or
rather
by
the
order
of
god
every
vein
and
artery
through
which
alcohol
has
to
pass
suddenly
contracts
as
if
to
prevent
its
passage
or
choke
it
as
a
deadly
foe
every
vein
and
artery
has
evidently
heard
the
voice
of
god
wine
is
a
mocker
it
bites
like
a
serpent
and
stings
like
an
adder
every
nerve
and
muscle
which
alcohol
touched
trembled
and
shook
as
if
in
the
presence
of
an
implacable
and
unconquerable
enemy
yes
at
the
presence
of
alcohol
every
nerve
and
muscle
loses
its
strength
just
as
the
bravest
man
in
the
presence
of
a
horrible
monster
or
demon
suddenly
loses
his
natural
strength
and
shakes
from
head
to
i
can
not
repeat
all
i
heard
that
day
from
the
lips
of
douglas
and
what
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
of
the
horrible
workings
of
alcohol
through
every
part
of
the
body
it
would
be
too
long
suffice
to
say
that
i
was
struck
with
horror
at
my
own
folly
and
at
the
folly
of
so
many
people
who
make
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
what
i
learned
that
day
was
like
the
opening
of
a
mysterious
door
which
allowed
me
to
see
the
untold
marvels
of
a
new
and
most
magnificent
world
but
though
i
was
with
the
ravages
of
strong
drink
in
that
dead
man
i
was
not
yet
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
being
a
total
abstainer
from
wine
and
beer
and
a
little
brandy
now
and
then
as
a
social
habit
i
did
not
like
to
expose
myself
to
ridicule
by
the
sacrifice
of
habits
which
seemed
then
more
than
now
to
be
among
the
sweetest
and
most
common
links
of
society
but
i
determined
to
lose
no
opportunity
of
continuing
the
study
of
the
working
of
alcohol
in
the
human
body
at
the
same
time
i
resolved
to
avail
myself
of
every
opportunity
of
making
a
complete
study
of
anatomy
under
the
kind
and
learned
douglas
it
is
from
the
lips
and
works
of
douglas
that
i
learned
the
following
startling
facts
the
heart
of
man
which
is
only
six
inches
long
by
four
inches
wide
beats
seventy
times
in
a
minute
in
one
hour
in
a
day
in
a
year
it
ejects
two
ounces
and
a
half
of
blood
out
of
itself
every
time
it
beats
which
makes
ounces
every
minute
pounds
every
hour
seven
tons
and
of
blood
which
goes
out
of
the
heart
every
day
the
whole
blood
of
a
man
runs
through
his
heart
in
three
minutes
the
skin
is
composed
of
three
parts
placed
over
each
other
whose
thickness
varies
from
a
quarter
to
an
eighth
of
a
line
each
square
inch
contains
pores
through
which
the
sweat
goes
out
every
one
of
them
is
a
pipe
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
all
those
small
pipes
united
together
would
form
a
canal
feet
to
forty
miles
or
nearly
thirteen
leagues
the
weight
of
the
blood
in
a
common
man
is
between
thirty
and
forty
pounds
the
blood
runs
through
the
body
in
seconds
or
one
minute
and
seconds
eleven
thousand
pints
of
blood
pass
through
the
lungs
in
hours
there
are
bones
in
the
human
body
of
them
are
in
the
head
in
the
sides
in
the
wrist
in
the
joints
and
in
the
hands
and
feet
the
heart
of
a
man
who
drinks
nothing
but
pure
water
beats
about
a
day
but
will
beat
from
to
times
more
if
he
drinks
alcoholic
drinks
those
who
have
not
learned
anatomy
know
little
of
the
infinite
power
wisdom
love
and
mercy
of
god
no
book
except
the
bible
and
no
science
except
the
science
of
astronomy
is
like
the
body
of
man
tell
us
what
our
god
is
and
what
we
the
body
of
man
is
a
book
written
by
the
hand
of
god
to
speak
to
us
of
him
as
no
man
can
speak
after
studying
the
marvellous
working
of
the
heart
the
lungs
the
eyes
and
the
brain
of
man
i
could
not
speak
i
remained
mute
unable
to
say
a
single
word
to
tell
my
admiration
and
awe
i
wept
as
overwhelmed
with
my
feelings
i
should
have
liked
to
speak
of
those
things
to
the
priests
with
whom
i
lived
but
i
saw
at
first
they
could
not
understand
me
they
thought
i
was
exaggerating
how
many
times
when
alone
with
god
in
my
little
closet
when
thinking
of
those
marvels
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
said
thou
art
great
o
my
god
the
works
of
thy
hands
are
above
the
works
of
man
but
the
works
of
thy
love
and
mercy
are
above
all
thy
other
works
during
the
four
years
i
was
chaplain
of
the
marine
hospital
more
than
one
hundred
corpses
were
opened
before
me
and
almost
as
many
outside
the
hospital
for
when
by
the
order
of
the
jury
and
the
coroner
an
autopsy
was
to
be
made
i
seldom
failed
to
attend
in
that
way
i
have
had
a
providential
opportunity
of
acquiring
the
knowledge
of
one
of
the
most
useful
and
admirable
sciences
as
no
priest
or
minister
probably
ever
had
on
this
continent
it
is
my
conviction
that
the
first
thing
a
temperance
orator
ought
to
do
is
to
study
anatomy
get
the
bodies
of
drunkards
as
well
as
those
of
temperate
drinkers
opened
before
him
and
study
there
the
workings
of
alcohol
in
the
different
organs
of
man
so
long
as
the
orators
on
temperance
will
not
do
that
they
can
not
understand
the
subject
on
which
they
speak
though
i
have
read
the
best
books
written
by
the
most
learned
physicians
of
england
france
and
the
united
states
on
the
ravages
of
rum
wine
and
beer
of
every
kind
and
name
in
the
body
of
men
i
have
never
read
anything
which
enlightened
me
so
much
and
brought
such
profound
convictions
to
my
intelligence
as
the
study
i
have
made
of
the
brain
the
lungs
the
heart
veins
arteries
nerves
and
muscles
of
a
single
man
or
woman
these
bodies
opened
before
me
were
books
written
by
the
hand
of
god
himself
and
they
spoke
to
me
as
no
man
could
speak
by
the
mercy
of
god
to
that
study
is
due
the
irresistible
power
of
my
humble
efforts
in
persuading
my
countrymen
to
give
up
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
but
here
is
the
time
to
tell
how
my
merciful
god
forced
me
his
unprofitable
and
rebellious
servant
almost
in
spite
of
myself
to
give
up
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
among
my
penitents
there
was
a
young
lady
belonging
to
one
of
the
most
respectable
families
in
quebec
she
had
a
child
a
girl
almost
a
year
old
who
was
a
real
beauty
nothing
this
side
of
heaven
could
surpass
the
charms
of
that
earthly
angel
of
course
that
young
mother
idolized
her
she
could
hardly
consent
to
be
without
her
sweet
angel
even
to
go
to
church
she
carried
her
everywhere
to
kiss
her
at
every
moment
and
press
her
to
her
heart
unfortunately
that
lady
as
it
was
then
and
is
still
now
too
often
the
case
even
among
the
most
refined
had
learned
in
her
father
s
house
and
by
the
example
of
her
own
mother
to
drink
wine
at
table
and
when
receiving
the
visits
of
her
friends
or
when
visiting
them
herself
little
by
little
she
began
to
drink
when
alone
a
few
drops
of
wine
at
first
by
the
advice
of
her
physician
but
soon
only
to
satisfy
the
craving
appetite
which
grew
stronger
day
by
day
i
was
the
only
one
excepting
her
husband
who
knew
this
fact
he
was
my
intimate
friend
and
several
times
with
tears
trickling
down
his
cheeks
he
had
requested
me
in
the
name
of
god
to
persuade
her
to
abstain
from
drinking
that
young
man
was
so
happy
with
his
accomplished
wife
and
his
incomparably
beautiful
child
he
was
rich
had
a
high
position
in
the
world
numberless
friends
and
a
palace
for
his
home
every
time
i
had
spoken
to
that
young
lady
either
when
alone
or
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
she
had
shed
tears
of
regret
she
had
promised
to
reform
and
take
only
the
few
glasses
prescribed
by
her
doctor
but
alas
that
fatal
prescription
of
the
doctor
was
like
the
oil
poured
on
the
burning
coals
it
was
kindling
a
fire
that
nothing
could
quench
one
day
which
i
will
never
forget
a
messenger
came
in
haste
and
said
mr
wants
you
to
come
to
his
home
immediately
a
terrible
misfortune
has
just
beautiful
child

just
been
killed
his
wife
is
half
crazy
he
fears
lest
she
will
kill
i
leaped
into
the
elegant
carriage
drawn
by
two
fine
horses
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
in
the
presence
of
the
most
distressing
spectacle
i
ever
saw
the
young
lady
tearing
her
robes
into
fragments
tearing
her
hair
with
her
hands
and
cutting
her
face
with
the
nails
of
her
fingers
was
crying
oh
for
god
s
sake

me
a
knife
that
i
may
cut
my
throat

have
killed
my
child

the
murderess
of
my
own
dear
lucy
my
hands
are
reddened
with
her
blood
oh
may
i
die
with
her
i
was
thunderstruck
and
at
first
remained
mute
and
motionless
the
young
husband
with
two
other
gentlemen
blanchet
and
coroner
panet
were
trying
to
hold
the
hands
of
his
unfortunate
wife
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
at
last
the
young
wife
casting
her
eyes
upon
me
said
oh
dear
father
chiniquy
for
god
s
sake
give
me
a
knife
that
i
may
cut
my
throat
when
drunk
i
took
my
precious
darling
in
my
arms
to
kiss
her
but
i
head
struck
the
sharp
corner
of
the
stove
her
brain
and
blood
are
there
spread
on
the
floor
my
child
my
own
child
is
dead
i
have
killed
her
cursed
liquor
cursed
wine
my
child
is
dead
i
am
damned
cursed
drink
i
could
not
speak
but
i
could
weep
and
cry
i
wept
and
mingled
my
tears
with
those
of
that
unfortunate
mother
then
with
an
expression
of
desolation
which
pierced
my
soul
as
with
a
sword
she
said
go
and
i
went
to
the
next
room
and
there
i
saw
that
once
beautiful
child
dead
her
face
covered
with
her
blood
and
brains
there
was
a
large
gap
made
in
the
right
temple
the
drunken
mother
by
falling
with
her
child
in
her
arms
had
caused
the
head
to
strike
with
such
a
terrible
force
on
the
stove
that
it
upset
on
the
floor
the
burning
coals
were
spread
on
every
side
and
the
house
had
been
very
nearly
on
fire
but
that
very
blow
with
the
awful
death
of
her
child
had
suddenly
brought
her
to
her
senses
and
put
an
end
to
her
intoxication
at
a
glance
she
saw
the
whole
extent
of
her
misfortune
her
first
thought
had
been
to
run
to
the
sideboard
seize
a
large
sharp
knife
and
cut
her
own
throat
providentially
her
husband
was
on
the
spot
with
great
difficulty
and
after
a
terrible
struggle
he
took
the
knife
out
of
her
hands
and
threw
it
into
the
street
through
the
window
it
was
then
about
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
after
an
hour
passed
in
indescribable
agony
of
mind
and
heart
i
attempted
to
leave
and
go
back
to
the
parsonage
but
my
unfortunate
young
friend
requested
me
in
the
name
of
god
to
spend
the
night
with
him
you
are
the
only
one
he
said
who
can
help
us
in
this
awful
night
my
misfortune
is
great
enough
without
destroying
our
good
name
by
spreading
it
in
public
i
want
to
keep
it
as
secret
as
possible
with
our
physician
and
coroner
you
are
the
only
man
on
earth
whom
i
trust
to
help
me
please
pass
the
night
with
i
remained
but
tried
in
vain
to
calm
the
unfortunate
mother
she
was
constantly
breaking
our
hearts
with
her
convulsive
efforts
to
take
her
own
life
every
minute
she
was
crying
my
child
my
darling
lucy
just
when
thy
little
arms
were
so
gently
caressing
me
and
thy
angelic
kisses
were
so
sweet
on
my
lips
i
have
slaughtered
thee
when
thou
wert
pressing
me
on
thy
loving
heart
and
kissing
me
i
thy
drunken
mother
gave
thee
the
death
blow
my
hands
are
reddened
with
thy
blood
my
breast
is
covered
with
thy
brains
oh
for
god
s
sake
my
dear
husband
take
my
life
i
can
not
consent
to
live
a
day
longer
my
dear
father
chiniquy
give
me
a
knife
that
i
may
mingle
my
blood
with
the
blood
of
my
child
o
that
i
could
be
buried
in
the
same
grave
with
her
in
vain
i
tried
to
speak
to
her
of
the
mercies
of
god
towards
sinners
she
would
not
listen
to
anything
i
could
say
she
was
absolutely
deaf
to
my
voice
at
about
ten
o
clock
she
had
a
most
terrible
fit
of
anguish
and
terror
though
we
were
four
men
to
keep
her
quiet
she
was
stronger
than
we
all
she
was
stronger
than
a
giant
she
slipped
from
our
hands
and
ran
to
the
room
where
the
dead
child
was
lying
in
her
cradle
grasping
the
cold
body
in
her
hands
she
tore
the
bands
of
white
linen
which
had
been
put
round
the
head
to
cover
the
horrible
wound
and
with
cries
of
desolation
she
pressed
her
lips
her
cheeks
her
very
eyes
on
the
horrible
gap
from
which
the
brain
and
blood
were
oozing
as
if
wanting
to
heal
it
and
recall
the
poor
dear
one
to
life
my
darling
my
beloved
my
own
dear
lucy
she
cried
open
thy
again
at
thy
mother
give
me
a
kiss
press
me
again
to
thy
bosom
but
thine
eyes
are
shut
thy
lips
are
cold
thou
dost
not
smile
on
me
any
longer
thou
art
dead
and
i
thy
mother
have
slaughtered
thee
canst
thou
forgive
me
thy
death
canst
thou
ask
jesus
christ
our
saviour
to
forgive
me
canst
thou
ask
the
blessed
virgin
mary
to
pray
for
me
will
i
never
see
thee
again
ah
no
i
am
am
damned
i
am
a
drunken
mother
who
has
murdered
her
own
darling
lucy
there
is
no
mercy
for
the
drunken
mother
the
murderess
of
her
own
and
when
speaking
thus
to
her
child
she
was
sometimes
kneeling
down
then
running
around
the
room
as
if
flying
before
a
phantom
but
even
then
she
was
constantly
pressing
the
motionless
body
to
her
bosom
or
convulsively
passing
her
lips
and
cheeks
over
the
horrible
wound
so
that
her
lips
her
whole
face
her
breast
and
hands
were
literally
besmeared
with
the
blood
flowing
from
the
wound
i
will
not
say
that
we
were
all
weeping
and
crying
for
the
words
weeping
and
crying
can
not
express
the
horror
we
felt
at
about
eleven
o
clock
when
on
her
knees
clasping
her
child
to
her
bosom
she
lifted
her
eyes
towards
me
and
said
dear
father
chiniquy
why
is
it
that
i
have
not
followed
your
charitable
advice
when
still
more
with
your
tears
than
with
words
you
tried
so
often
to
persuade
me
to
give
up
the
use
of
those
cursed
intoxicating
wines
how
many
times
you
have
given
me
the
very
words
which
come
from
heaven
wine
is
a
mocker
it
bites
as
a
serpent
and
stings
as
an
adder
how
many
times
in
the
name
of
my
dear
child
in
the
name
of
my
dear
husband
in
the
name
of
god
you
have
asked
me
to
give
up
the
use
of
those
cursed
drinks
but
listen
now
to
my
prayer
go
all
over
canada
tell
all
the
fathers
never
to
put
any
intoxicating
drink
before
the
eyes
of
their
children
it
was
at
my
father
s
table
that
i
first
learned
to
drink
that
wine
which
i
will
curse
during
all
eternity
tell
all
the
mothers
never
to
taste
these
abominable
drinks
it
was
my
mother
who
first
taught
me
to
drink
that
wine
which
i
will
curse
as
long
as
god
is
take
the
blood
of
my
child
and
go
redden
with
it
the
top
of
the
doors
of
every
house
in
canada
and
say
to
all
those
who
dwell
in
those
houses
that
that
blood
was
shed
by
the
hand
of
a
murderess
mother
when
drunk
with
that
blood
write
on
the
walls
of
every
house
in
canada
that
wine
is
a
tell
the
french
canadians
how
on
the
dead
body
of
my
child
i
have
cursed
that
wine
which
has
made
me
so
wretchedly
miserable
and
she
then
stopped
as
if
to
breathe
a
little
for
a
few
minutes
she
added
in
the
name
of
god
tell
me
can
my
child
forgive
me
her
death
can
she
ask
god
to
look
upon
me
with
mercy
can
she
cause
the
blessed
virgin
mary
to
pray
for
me
and
obtain
my
pardon
but
before
i
could
answer
she
horrified
us
by
the
cries
i
am
lost
when
drunk
i
killed
my
child
cursed
wine
and
she
fell
a
corpse
on
the
floor
torrents
of
blood
were
flowing
from
her
mouth
on
her
dead
child
which
she
was
pressing
to
her
bosom
even
after
her
death
that
terrible
drama
was
never
revealed
to
the
people
of
quebec
the
coroner
s
inquest
was
that
the
child
s
death
was
accidental
and
that
the
distressed
mother
died
from
a
broken
heart
six
hours
after
two
days
later
the
unfortunate
mother
was
buried
with
the
body
of
her
child
clasped
in
her
arms
many
tears
were
shed
on
that
tomb
and
this
dear
little
child
s
guardian
angel
must
have
written
with
its
blood
on
that
tomb
wine
is
a
mocker
look
not
at
it
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
and
stings
like
an
however
what
i
had
just
seen
and
heard
could
not
be
buried
and
forgotten
in
the
grave
after
such
a
terrible
storm
i
was
in
need
of
solitude
and
rest
but
above
everything
i
was
in
need
of
praying
i
shut
myself
in
my
little
room
for
two
days
and
there
alone
in
the
presence
of
god
i
meditated
on
the
terrible
justice
and
retribution
which
he
had
called
me
to
witness
the
unfortunate
woman
had
not
only
been
my
penitent
she
had
been
with
her
husband
among
my
dearest
and
most
devoted
friends
it
was
only
lately
that
she
had
become
a
slave
to
drunkenness
before
that
her
piety
and
sense
of
honor
were
of
the
most
exalted
kind
known
in
the
church
of
rome
her
last
words
were
not
the
commonplace
expressions
which
ordinary
sinners
proffer
at
the
approach
of
death
her
words
had
a
solemnity
for
me
which
almost
transformed
them
into
oracles
of
god
in
my
mind
each
of
them
sounded
in
my
ears
as
if
an
angel
of
god
had
touched
the
thousand
strings
of
my
soul
to
call
my
attention
to
a
message
from
heaven
sometimes
they
resembled
the
terrible
voice
of
thunder
and
again
it
seemed
as
if
a
seraph
with
his
golden
harp
were
singing
them
in
my
ears
that
i
might
prepare
to
fight
faithfully
for
the
lord
against
his
gigantic
enemy
alcohol
in
the
middle
of
that
horrible
night
when
the
darkness
was
most
profound
and
the
stillness
fearful
was
i
awake
was
i
sleeping
i
do
not
know
but
i
saw
the
calm
beautiful
and
cherished
form
of
my
dear
mother
standing
by
me
holding
by
the
hand
the
late
murderess
still
covered
with
the
blood
of
her
child
yes
my
beloved
mother
was
there
standing
before
me
and
she
said
with
power
and
authority
which
engraved
every
one
of
her
words
on
my
soul
as
if
written
with
letters
of
tears
blood
and
fire
go
all
over
canada
tell
every
father
of
a
family
never
to
put
any
intoxicating
drink
before
his
children
tell
all
the
mothers
never
to
take
a
drop
of
those
cursed
wines
and
drinks
tell
the
whole
people
of
canada
never
to
touch
nor
look
at
the
poisoned
cup
filled
with
those
cursed
intoxicating
drinks
and
thou
my
beloved
son
give
up
forever
the
use
of
those
detestable
beverages
which
are
cursed
in
hell
in
heaven
and
on
earth
it
bites
like
a
serpent
it
stings
like
an
when
the
sound
of
that
voice
so
sweet
and
powerful
was
hushed
and
my
soul
had
ceased
seeing
that
strange
vision
of
the
night
i
remained
for
some
time
exceedingly
agitated
and
troubled
i
said
to
myself
is
it
possible
that
the
terrible
things
i
have
seen
and
heard
these
last
few
days
will
destroy
my
mind
and
send
me
to
the
lunatic
asylum
i
had
hardly
been
able
to
take
any
sleep
or
food
for
the
last
three
days
and
nights
and
i
seriously
feared
lest
the
weakness
of
my
body
would
cause
me
to
lose
my
reason
i
then
threw
myself
on
my
knees
to
weep
and
pray
this
did
me
good
i
soon
felt
myself
stronger
and
calmer
raising
again
my
mind
to
god
i
said
o
my
god
let
me
know
thy
holy
will
and
grant
me
the
grace
to
do
it
do
the
voices
i
have
just
heard
come
from
thee
hast
thou
really
sent
one
of
the
angels
of
thy
mercy
under
the
form
of
my
beloved
mother
or
is
all
this
nothing
but
the
vain
dreams
of
my
distressed
mind
is
it
thy
will
o
my
god
that
i
should
go
and
tell
my
country
what
thou
hast
so
providentially
taught
me
of
the
horrible
and
unsuspected
injuries
which
wine
and
strong
drink
cause
to
the
bodies
as
well
as
to
the
souls
of
men
or
is
it
thy
will
that
i
should
conceal
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
wonderful
things
thou
hast
made
known
to
me
and
that
i
might
bury
them
with
me
in
my
grave
as
quick
as
lightning
the
answer
was
suggested
to
me
what
i
have
taught
thee
in
secret
go
and
tell
it
on
the
housetops
overwhelmed
with
an
unspeakable
emotion
and
my
heart
filled
with
a
power
which
was
not
mine
i
raised
my
hands
toward
heaven
and
said
to
my
god
for
my
dear
saviour
jesus
sake
and
for
the
good
of
my
country
o
my
god
i
promise
that
i
will
never
make
any
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
i
will
moreover
do
all
in
my
power
to
persuade
the
other
priests
and
the
people
to
make
the
same
sacrifice
fifty
years
have
passed
since
i
took
that
pledge
and
thanks
be
to
god
i
have
kept
it
for
the
next
two
years
i
was
the
only
priest
in
canada
who
abstained
from
the
use
of
wine
and
other
intoxicating
drinks
and
god
only
knows
what
i
had
to
suffer
all
that
sneers
and
rebukes
and
insults
of
every
kind
i
had
silently
to
bear
how
many
times
the
epithets
of
have
been
whispered
into
my
ear
not
only
by
the
priests
but
also
by
the
bishops
but
i
was
sure
that
my
god
knew
the
motives
of
my
actions
and
by
his
grace
i
remained
calm
and
patient
in
his
infinite
mercy
has
looked
down
upon
his
unprofitable
servant
and
has
taken
his
part
he
had
himself
chosen
the
day
when
my
humiliations
were
to
be
turned
into
great
joy
the
day
came
when
i
saw
those
same
priests
and
bishops
at
the
head
of
their
people
receiving
the
pledge
and
blessing
of
temperance
from
my
hands
those
very
bishops
who
had
unanimously
at
first
condemned
me
soon
invited
the
first
citizens
of
their
cities
to
present
me
with
a
golden
medal
as
a
token
of
their
esteem
after
giving
me
officially
the
title
of
apostle
of
temperance
of
the
governor
and
the
two
chambers
of
parliament
of
canada
voted
me
public
thanks
in
and
presented
me
as
a
public
testimony
of
their
kind
feelings
for
what
had
been
done
in
the
cause
of
temperance
it
was
the
will
of
my
god
that
i
should
see
with
my
own
eyes
my
dear
canada
taking
the
pledge
of
temperance
and
giving
up
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
how
many
tears
were
dried
in
those
days
thousands
and
thousands
of
broken
hearts
were
consoled
and
filled
with
joy
happiness
and
abundance
reigned
in
many
once
desolate
homes
and
the
name
of
our
merciful
god
was
blessed
everywhere
in
my
beloved
country
surely
this
was
not
the
work
of
poor
chiniquy
it
was
the
lord
s
work
for
the
lord
who
is
wonderful
in
all
his
doings
had
once
more
chosen
the
weakest
instrument
to
show
his
mercy
towards
the
children
of
men
he
had
called
the
most
unprofitable
of
his
servants
to
do
the
greatest
work
of
reform
canada
has
ever
seen
that
the
praise
and
glory
might
be
given
to
him

conversions
of
protestants
to
the
church
of
anthony
parent
superior
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
his
peculiar
way
of
finding
access
to
the
protestants
and
bringing
them
to
the
catholic
he
spies
the
protestants
through
the
persuade
families
to
become
catholics
out
of
the
church
of
rome
there
is
no
salvation
is
one
of
the
doctrines
which
the
priests
of
rome
have
to
believe
and
teach
to
the
people
that
dogma
once
accepted
caused
me
to
devote
all
my
energies
to
the
conversion
of
protestants
to
prevent
one
of
those
immortal
and
precious
souls
from
going
into
hell
seemed
to
me
more
important
and
glorious
that
the
conquest
of
a
kingdom
in
view
of
showing
them
their
errors
i
filled
my
library
with
the
best
controversial
books
which
could
be
got
in
quebec
and
i
studied
the
holy
scriptures
with
the
utmost
attention
in
the
marine
hospital
as
well
as
in
my
intercourse
with
the
people
of
the
city
i
had
several
occasions
of
meeting
protestants
and
talking
to
them
but
i
found
at
once
that
with
very
few
exceptions
they
avoided
speaking
with
me
on
religion
this
distressed
me
having
been
told
one
day
that
the
rev
anthony
parent
superior
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
had
converted
several
hundred
protestants
during
his
ministry
i
went
to
ask
him
if
this
were
true
for
answer
he
showed
me
the
list
of
his
converts
which
numbered
more
than
two
hundred
among
whom
were
some
of
the
most
respectable
english
and
scotch
families
of
the
city
i
looked
upon
that
list
with
amazement
and
from
that
day
i
considered
him
the
most
blessed
priest
of
canada
he
was
a
perfect
gentleman
in
his
manners
and
was
considered
our
best
champion
on
all
points
of
controversy
with
protestants
he
could
have
been
classed
also
among
the
handsomest
men
in
his
time
had
not
he
been
so
fat
but
when
the
high
classes
called
him
by
the
respectable
name
of
mr
superior
of
the
seminary
the
common
people
used
to
name
him
pere
cocassier
father
on
account
of
his
habit
of
having
the
bravest
and
strongest
of
the
country
in
vain
had
the
rev
renvoyze
curate
of
the
good
anne
that
greatest
saint
of
canada
expended
fabulous
sums
of
money
in
ransacking
the
whole
country
to
get
a
cock
who
would
take
away
the
palm
of
victory
from
the
hands
of
the
superior
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
he
had
almost
invariably
failed
with
very
few
exceptions
his
cocks
had
fallen
bruised
bleeding
and
dead
on
the
many
battlefields
chosen
by
those
two
priests
however
i
feel
happy
in
acknowledging
that
since
the
terrible
epidemic
of
cholera
that
cruel
and
ignominious
has
been
entirely
given
up
by
the
roman
catholic
clergy
of
this
country
playing
cards
and
checkers
is
now
the
most
usual
way
the
majority
of
curates
and
vicars
have
recourse
to
spend
their
long
and
many
idle
hours
both
of
the
week
and
sabbath
days
after
reading
over
and
over
again
that
long
list
of
converts
i
said
to
parent
please
tell
me
how
you
have
been
able
to
persuade
these
protestant
converts
to
consent
to
speak
with
you
on
the
errors
of
their
religion
many
times
i
have
tried
to
show
the
protestants
whom
i
met
that
they
would
be
lost
if
they
do
not
submit
to
our
holy
church
but
with
few
exceptions
they
laughed
at
me
as
politely
as
possible
and
turned
the
conversation
to
other
matters
you
must
have
some
secret
way
of
attracting
their
attention
and
winning
their
confidence
would
you
not
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
that
secret
that
i
may
be
able
also
to
prevent
some
of
those
precious
souls
from
perishing
you
are
right
when
you
think
that
i
have
a
secret
to
open
the
doors
of
the
protestants
and
conquer
and
tame
their
haughty
minds
answered
parent
but
that
secret
is
of
such
a
delicate
nature
that
i
have
never
revealed
it
to
anybody
except
my
confessor
nevertheless
i
see
that
you
are
so
in
earnest
for
the
conversion
of
protestants
and
i
have
such
a
confidence
in
your
discretion
and
honor
that
for
the
sake
of
our
holy
church
i
consent
to
give
you
my
secret
only
you
must
promise
that
you
will
never
reveal
it
during
my
lifetime
to
even
after
my
death
you
will
not
mention
it
except
when
you
are
sure
it
is
for
the
greatest
glory
of
god
you
know
that
i
was
the
most
intimate
friend
your
father
ever
had
i
had
no
secret
from
him
and
he
had
none
from
me
but
god
knows
that
the
friendly
feelings
and
confidence
i
had
in
him
are
now
bestowed
upon
you
his
worthy
son
if
you
had
not
in
my
heart
and
esteem
the
same
high
position
your
father
occupied
i
would
not
trust
you
with
my
he
then
continued
the
majority
of
protestants
in
quebec
have
irish
roman
catholic
servant
girls
these
particularly
before
the
last
few
years
used
to
come
to
confess
to
me
as
i
was
almost
the
only
priest
who
spoke
english
the
first
thing
i
used
to
ask
them
when
they
were
confessing
was
if
their
masters
and
mistresses
were
truly
devoted
and
pious
protestants
or
if
they
were
indifferent
and
cold
in
performing
their
duties
the
second
thing
i
wanted
to
know
was
if
they
were
on
good
terms
with
their
ministers
whether
or
not
they
were
visited
by
them
from
the
answers
of
the
girls
i
knew
both
the
moral
and
immoral
the
religious
or
irreligious
habits
of
their
masters
as
perfectly
as
if
i
had
been
an
inmate
of
their
households
it
is
thus
that
i
learned
that
many
protestants
have
no
more
religion
and
faith
than
our
dogs
they
awake
in
the
morning
and
go
to
bed
at
night
without
praying
to
god
any
more
than
the
horses
in
their
stables
many
of
them
go
to
church
on
the
sabbath
day
more
to
laugh
at
their
ministers
and
criticise
their
sermons
than
for
anything
else
a
part
of
the
week
is
passed
in
turning
them
into
ridicule
nay
through
the
confessions
of
these
honest
girls
i
learned
that
many
protestants
liked
the
fine
ceremonies
of
our
church
that
they
often
favorably
contrasted
them
with
the
cold
performances
of
their
own
and
expressed
their
views
in
glowing
terms
about
the
superiority
of
our
educational
institutions
nunneries
over
their
own
high
schools
or
colleges
besides
you
know
that
a
great
number
of
our
most
respectable
and
wealthy
protestants
trust
their
daughters
to
our
good
nuns
for
their
education
i
took
notes
of
all
these
things
and
formed
my
plans
of
battle
against
protestantism
as
a
general
who
knows
his
ground
and
the
weak
points
of
his
adversaries
and
i
fought
as
a
man
who
is
sure
of
an
easy
victory
the
glorious
result
you
have
under
your
eyes
is
the
proof
that
i
was
correct
in
my
plans
my
first
step
with
the
protestants
whom
i
knew
to
be
without
any
religion
or
even
already
well
disposed
toward
us
was
to
go
to
them
with
sometimes
or
even
which
i
presented
to
them
as
being
theirs
they
at
first
looked
at
me
with
amazement
as
a
being
coming
from
a
superior
world
the
following
conversation
then
almost
invariably
took
place
between
them
and
me
are
you
positive
sir
that
this
money
is
mine
yes
sir
i
answered
i
am
certain
that
this
money
is
but
they
replied
please
tell
me
how
you
know
that
it
belongs
to
me
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
the
honor
of
talking
with
you
and
we
are
perfect
strangers
to
each
i
answered
i
can
not
say
sir
how
i
know
that
this
money
is
yours
except
by
telling
you
that
the
person
who
deposited
it
in
my
hands
for
you
has
given
me
your
name
and
your
address
so
correctly
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
any
but
can
i
not
know
the
name
of
the
one
who
has
put
that
money
into
your
hands
for
me
rejoined
the
protestant
no
sir
the
secret
of
confession
is
inviolable
i
replied
we
have
no
example
that
it
has
ever
been
broken
and
i
with
every
priest
of
our
church
would
prefer
to
die
rather
than
betray
our
penitents
and
reveal
their
confession
we
can
not
even
act
from
what
we
have
learned
through
their
confession
except
at
their
own
but
this
auricular
confession
must
then
be
a
most
admirable
thing
added
the
protestant
i
had
no
idea
of
it
before
this
yes
sir
auricular
confession
is
a
most
admirable
thing
i
used
to
reply
because
it
is
a
divine
institution
but
sir
please
excuse
me
my
ministry
calls
me
to
another
place
i
must
take
leave
of
you
to
go
where
my
duty
calls
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
go
so
quickly
generally
answered
the
protestant
can
i
have
another
visit
from
you
please
do
me
the
honor
of
coming
again
i
would
be
so
happy
to
present
you
to
my
wife
and
i
know
she
would
be
happy
also
and
much
honored
to
make
your
yes
sir
i
accept
with
gratitude
your
invitation
i
will
feel
much
pleased
and
honored
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
family
of
a
gentleman
whose
praises
are
in
the
mouth
of
every
one
and
whose
industry
and
honesty
are
an
honor
to
our
city
if
you
will
allow
me
next
week
at
the
same
hour
i
will
have
the
honor
of
presenting
my
respectful
homage
to
your
lady
the
very
next
day
all
the
papers
reported
that
had
received
or
or
even
as
a
restitution
through
auricular
confession
and
even
the
staunch
protestant
editors
of
those
papers
could
not
find
words
sufficiently
eloquent
to
praise
me
and
our
sacrament
of
penance
three
or
four
days
later
i
was
sure
that
the
faithful
servant
girls
were
in
the
glowing
with
joy
to
tell
me
that
now
their
masters
and
mistresses
could
not
speak
of
anything
else
than
the
amiability
and
honesty
of
the
priests
of
rome
they
raised
them
a
thousand
miles
over
the
heads
of
their
own
ministers
from
those
pious
girls
i
invariably
learned
that
that
they
had
not
been
visited
by
a
single
friend
without
making
the
eulogium
of
auricular
confession
and
even
sometimes
expressing
the
regret
that
the
reformers
had
swept
away
such
a
useful
institution
now
my
dear
young
friend
you
see
how
by
the
blessing
of
god
the
little
sacrifice
of
a
few
pounds
brought
down
and
destroyed
all
the
prejudices
of
those
poor
heretics
against
auricular
confession
and
our
holy
church
in
general
you
understand
how
the
doors
were
opened
to
me
and
how
their
hearts
and
intelligences
were
like
fields
prepared
to
receive
the
good
seed
at
the
appointed
hour
i
never
failed
from
paying
the
requested
visit
and
i
was
invariably
received
like
a
messiah
not
only
the
gentlemen
but
the
ladies
overwhelmed
me
with
marks
of
the
most
sincere
gratitude
and
respect
even
the
dear
little
children
petted
me
and
threw
their
arms
around
my
neck
to
give
me
their
sweetly
angelic
kisses
the
only
topic
on
which
we
could
speak
of
course
was
the
great
good
done
by
auricular
confession
i
easily
showed
them
how
it
works
as
a
check
to
all
the
evil
passions
of
the
heart
how
it
is
admirably
adapted
to
all
the
wants
of
the
poor
sinners
who
find
a
friend
a
counsellor
a
guide
a
father
a
real
saviour
in
their
confessor
we
had
not
talked
half
an
hour
in
that
way
when
it
was
generally
evident
to
me
that
they
were
more
than
half
way
out
of
their
protestant
errors
i
very
seldom
left
the
houses
without
being
sure
of
a
new
glorious
victory
for
our
holy
religion
over
its
enemies
it
is
very
seldom
that
i
do
not
succeed
in
bringing
that
family
to
our
holy
church
before
one
or
two
years
and
if
i
fail
of
gaining
the
father
or
mother
i
am
nearly
sure
to
persuade
them
to
send
their
daughters
to
our
good
nuns
and
their
boys
to
our
colleges
where
they
sooner
or
later
become
our
most
devoted
catholics
so
you
see
that
the
few
dollars
i
spend
every
year
for
that
holy
cause
are
the
best
investments
ever
made
they
do
more
to
catch
the
protestants
of
quebec
than
the
baits
of
the
fishermen
do
to
secure
the
cod
fishes
of
the
newfoundland
in
ending
this
last
sentence
parent
filled
his
room
with
laughter
i
thanked
him
for
these
interesting
details
but
i
told
him
though
i
can
not
but
admire
your
perfect
skill
and
shrewdness
in
breaking
the
barriers
which
prevent
protestants
from
understanding
the
divine
institution
of
auricular
confession
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
if
you
do
not
fear
to
be
guilty
of
an
imposture
and
a
gross
imposition
in
the
way
you
make
them
believe
that
the
money
you
hand
them
has
come
to
you
through
auricular
confession
i
have
not
the
least
fear
of
that
promptly
answered
the
old
priest
for
the
good
reason
that
if
you
had
paid
attention
to
what
i
have
told
you
you
must
acknowledge
that
i
have
not
said
positively
that
the
money
was
coming
from
auricular
confession
if
those
protestants
have
been
deceived
it
is
only
due
to
their
own
want
of
a
more
perfect
attention
to
what
i
said
i
know
that
there
were
things
that
i
kept
in
my
mind
which
would
have
made
them
understand
the
matter
in
a
very
different
way
if
i
had
said
them
but
liguori
and
all
our
theologians
among
the
most
approved
of
our
holy
church
tell
us
that
these
reservations
of
the
mind
are
allowed
when
they
are
for
the
good
of
souls
and
the
glory
of
yes
answered
i
i
know
that
such
is
the
doctrine
of
liguori
and
it
is
approved
by
the
popes
i
must
confess
however
that
this
seems
to
me
entirely
opposed
to
what
we
read
in
the
sublime
gospel
the
simple
and
sublime
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
of
our
saviour
seems
to
me
in
contradiction
with
the
art
of
deceiving
even
when
not
saying
absolute
and
direct
falsehoods
and
if
i
submit
myself
to
those
doctrines
it
is
always
with
a
secret
protest
in
my
inmost
in
an
angry
manner
parent
replied
now
my
dear
young
friend
i
understand
the
truth
of
what
the
rev
perras
and
bedard
told
me
lately
about
you
though
these
remarkable
priests
are
full
of
esteem
for
you
they
see
a
dark
cloud
on
your
horizon
they
say
that
you
spend
too
much
time
in
reading
the
bible
and
not
enough
in
studying
the
doctrines
and
holy
traditions
of
the
church
you
are
too
much
inclined
also
to
interpret
the
word
of
god
according
to
your
own
fallible
intelligence
instead
of
going
to
the
church
for
that
interpretation
this
is
the
dangerous
rock
on
which
luther
and
calvin
were
wrecked
take
my
advice
do
not
try
to
be
wiser
than
the
church
obey
her
voice
when
she
speaks
to
you
through
her
holy
theologians
this
is
your
only
safeguard
the
bishop
would
suspend
you
at
once
were
he
aware
of
your
want
of
faith
in
the
these
last
words
were
said
with
such
emphasis
that
they
seemed
more
like
a
sentence
of
condemnation
from
the
lips
of
an
irritated
judge
than
anything
else
i
felt
that
i
had
again
seriously
compromised
myself
in
his
mind
and
the
only
way
of
preventing
him
from
denouncing
me
to
the
bishop
as
a
heretic
and
a
protestant
was
to
make
an
apology
and
withdraw
from
the
dangerous
ground
on
which
i
had
again
so
imprudently
put
myself
he
accepted
my
explanation
but
i
saw
that
he
bitterly
regretted
having
trusted
me
with
his
secret
i
withdrew
from
his
presence
much
humiliated
by
my
want
of
prudence
and
wisdom
however
though
i
could
not
approve
of
all
the
of
the
superior
of
quebec
i
could
not
but
admire
then
the
glorious
results
of
his
efforts
in
converting
protestants
and
i
took
the
resolution
of
devoting
myself
more
than
ever
to
show
them
their
errors
and
make
them
good
catholics
in
this
i
was
too
successful
for
during
my
years
of
priesthood
i
have
persuaded
protestants
to
give
up
their
gospel
light
and
truth
in
order
to
follow
the
dark
and
lying
traditions
of
rome
i
can
not
enter
into
the
details
of
their
conversions
or
rather
perversions
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
soon
found
that
my
only
chance
of
success
in
that
proselytizing
work
was
among
the
ritualists
i
saw
at
first
that
calvin
and
knox
had
dug
a
really
impassable
abyss
between
the
presbyterians
methodists
baptists
and
the
church
of
rome
if
these
ritualists
remain
protestants
and
do
not
make
the
very
short
step
which
separates
them
from
rome
it
is
a
most
astonishing
fact
when
they
are
logical
men
some
people
are
surprised
that
so
many
eminent
and
learned
men
in
great
britain
and
america
give
up
their
protestantism
to
submit
to
the
church
of
rome
but
my
wonder
is
that
there
are
so
few
among
them
who
fall
into
that
bottomless
abyss
of
idolatry
and
folly
when
they
are
their
whole
life
on
the
very
brink
of
the
chasm
put
millions
of
men
on
the
very
brink
of
the
falls
of
niagara
force
them
to
cross
to
and
fro
in
small
canoes
between
both
shores
and
you
will
see
that
every
day
some
of
them
will
be
dragged
in
spite
of
themselves
into
the
yawning
abyss
nay
you
will
see
that
sooner
or
later
those
millions
of
people
will
be
in
danger
of
being
dragged
in
a
whole
body
by
the
irresistible
force
of
the
dashing
waters
into
the
fathomless
gulf
through
a
sublime
effort
the
english
people
helped
by
the
mighty
and
merciful
hand
of
god
have
come
out
from
the
abyss
of
folly
impurity
ignorance
slavery
and
idolatry
called
the
church
of
rome
but
many
alas
in
the
present
day
instead
of
marching
up
to
the
high
regions
of
unsullied
gospel
truth
and
of
going
up
to
the
high
mountains
where
true
christian
simplicity
and
liberty
have
forever
planted
their
glorious
been
induced
to
walk
only
a
few
steps
out
of
the
pestiferous
regions
of
popery
they
have
remained
so
near
the
pestilential
atmosphere
of
the
stagnant
waters
of
death
which
flow
from
rome
that
the
atmosphere
they
breathe
is
still
filled
with
the
deadly
emanations
of
that
modern
sodom
who
without
shedding
tears
of
sorrow
can
look
at
those
misguided
ministers
of
the
gospel
who
believe
and
teach
in
the
episcopal
church
that
they
have
the
power
to
make
their
god
with
a
wafer
and
who
bow
down
before
that
wafer
god
and
adore
him
who
can
refrain
from
indignation
at
the
sight
of
so
many
episcopal
ministers
who
consent
to
have
their
ears
minds
and
souls
polluted
at
the
confessional
by
the
stories
of
their
penitents
whom
in
their
turn
they
destroy
by
their
infamous
and
unmentionable
questions
when
i
was
lecturing
in
england
in
the
late
archbishop
of
canterbury
then
bishop
of
london
invited
me
to
his
table
in
company
with
rev
thomas
now
bishop
of
coulbourne
australia
and
put
to
me
the
following
questions
in
the
presence
of
his
numerous
and
noble
guests
father
chiniquy
when
you
left
the
church
of
rome
why
did
you
not
join
the
episcopalian
rather
than
the
presbyterian
church
i
answered
is
it
the
desire
of
your
lordship
that
i
should
speak
my
mind
on
that
delicate
subject
yes
yes
said
the
noble
lord
bishop
then
my
lord
i
must
tell
you
that
my
only
reason
is
that
i
find
in
your
church
several
doctrines
which
i
have
to
condemn
in
the
church
of
how
is
that
replied
his
lordship
please
i
answered
let
me
have
one
of
your
common
prayer
taking
the
book
i
read
slowly
the
article
on
the
visitation
of
the
sick
then
shall
the
sick
person
be
moved
to
make
a
special
confession
of
his
sins
if
he
feels
his
conscience
troubled
with
any
weighty
matters
after
which
confession
the
priest
shall
absolve
him
after
this
sort
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
hath
left
power
to
his
church
to
absolve
all
sinners
who
repent
and
believe
in
him
of
his
great
mercy
forgive
thee
all
thine
offenses
and
by
his
authority
committed
to
me
i
absolve
thee
of
all
thy
sins
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
i
then
added
now
my
lord
where
is
the
difference
between
the
errors
of
rome
and
your
church
on
this
subject
the
difference
is
very
great
he
answered
the
church
of
rome
is
constantly
pressing
the
sinners
to
come
to
her
priests
all
their
lifetime
where
we
subject
the
sinner
to
this
humiliation
only
once
in
his
life
when
he
is
near
his
last
but
my
lord
let
me
tell
you
that
it
seems
to
me
the
church
of
rome
is
much
more
logical
and
consistent
in
this
than
the
episcopal
church
both
churches
believe
and
teach
that
they
have
received
from
christ
the
power
to
forgive
the
sins
of
those
who
confess
to
their
priests
and
you
think
yourself
wiser
because
you
invite
the
sinner
to
confess
and
receive
his
pardon
only
when
he
is
tied
to
a
bed
of
suffering
at
the
last
hour
before
his
death
but
will
your
lordship
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
when
i
am
in
danger
of
death
if
i
am
constantly
in
danger
of
death
must
you
not
with
the
church
of
rome
induce
me
constantly
to
confess
to
your
priests
and
get
my
pardon
and
make
my
peace
with
god
has
our
saviour
said
anywhere
that
it
was
only
for
the
dying
at
the
last
extremity
of
life
that
he
gave
the
power
to
forgive
my
sins
has
he
not
warned
me
many
times
to
be
always
ready
to
have
always
our
peace
made
with
god
and
not
to
wait
till
the
last
day
to
the
last
hour
the
noble
bishop
did
not
think
fit
to
give
me
any
other
answer
than
these
very
words
we
all
agree
that
this
doctrine
ought
never
to
have
been
put
in
our
common
prayer
book
but
you
know
that
we
are
at
work
to
revise
that
book
and
we
hope
that
this
clause
with
several
others
will
be
taken
then
i
answered
in
a
jocose
way
my
lord
when
this
obnoxious
clause
has
been
removed
from
your
common
prayer
book
it
will
be
time
for
me
to
have
the
honor
of
belonging
to
your
great
and
noble
when
the
church
of
england
went
out
of
the
church
of
rome
she
did
as
rachel
the
wife
of
jacob
who
left
the
house
of
her
father
laban
and
took
his
gods
with
her
so
the
episcopal
church
of
england
unfortunately
when
she
left
rome
concealed
in
the
folds
of
her
mantle
some
of
the
false
gods
of
rome
she
kept
to
her
bosom
some
vipers
engendered
in
the
marshes
of
the
modern
sodom
these
vipers
if
not
soon
destroyed
will
kill
her
they
are
already
eating
up
her
vitals
they
are
covering
her
with
most
ugly
and
mortal
wounds
they
are
rapidly
taking
away
her
life
may
the
holy
ghost
rebaptize
and
purify
that
noble
church
of
england
that
she
may
be
worthy
to
march
at
the
head
of
the
armies
of
the
lord
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
under
the
banners
of
the
great

chapter
xxx
the
murders
and
thefts
in
quebec
from
to
night
excursion
with
two
dawn
of
light
the
three
years
which
followed
the
cholera
will
be
long
remembered
in
quebec
for
the
number
of
audacious
thefts
and
the
murders
which
kept
the
whole
population
in
constant
terror
almost
every
week
the
public
press
had
to
give
us
the
account
of
the
robbery
of
the
houses
of
some
of
our
rich
merchants
or
old
wealthy
widows
many
times
the
blood
was
chilled
in
our
veins
by
the
cruel
and
savage
assassinations
which
had
been
committed
by
the
thieves
when
resistance
had
been
offered
the
number
of
these
crimes
the
audacity
with
which
they
were
perpetrated
the
ability
with
which
the
guilty
parties
escaped
from
all
the
researches
of
the
police
indicated
that
they
were
well
organized
and
had
a
leader
of
uncommon
shrewdness
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
religious
population
of
quebec
the
thefts
of
the
of
february
surpassed
all
the
others
by
its
sacrilegious
character
that
night
the
chapel
dedicated
to
the
blessed
virgin
mary
was
entered
a
silver
statue
of
the
virgin
the
gift
of
the
king
of
france
a
massive
lamp
a
silver
candlestick
and
the
silver
vases
which
contained
the
bread
which
the
roman
catholics
believe
to
be
the
body
blood
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
were
stolen
and
the
holy
sacrament
impiously
thrown
and
scattered
on
the
floor
nothing
can
express
the
horror
and
indignation
of
the
whole
catholic
population
at
this
last
outrage
large
sums
of
money
were
offered
in
order
that
the
brigands
might
be
detected
at
last
five
of
mathieu
gagnon
waterworth
and
caught
in
tried
found
guilty
and
condemned
to
death
in
the
month
of
march
during
the
trial
and
when
public
attention
was
most
intensely
fixed
on
its
different
aspects
in
a
damp
chilly
dark
night
i
was
called
to
visit
a
sick
man
i
was
soon
ready
and
asked
the
name
of
the
sick
man
from
the
messenger
he
answered
that
it
was
francis
oregon
as
a
matter
of
course
i
said
that
the
sick
man
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
and
that
i
had
never
heard
that
there
was
even
such
a
man
in
the
world
but
when
i
was
near
the
carriage
which
was
to
take
me
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
that
the
first
messenger
left
abruptly
and
disappeared
looking
with
attention
then
at
the
faces
of
the
two
men
who
had
come
for
me
in
the
carriage
it
seemed
that
they
both
wore
masks
what
does
this
mean
i
said
each
of
you
wear
a
mask
do
you
mean
to
murder
me
dear
father
chiniquy
answered
one
of
them
in
a
low
trembling
voice
and
in
a
supplicating
tone
fear
not
we
swear
before
god
that
no
evil
will
be
done
to
you
on
the
contrary
god
and
man
will
to
the
end
of
the
world
praise
and
bless
you
if
you
come
to
our
help
and
save
our
souls
as
well
as
our
mortal
bodies
we
have
in
our
hands
a
great
part
of
the
silver
articles
stolen
these
last
three
years
the
police
are
on
our
track
and
we
are
in
great
danger
of
being
caught
for
god
s
sake
come
with
us
we
will
put
all
those
stolen
things
in
your
hands
that
you
may
give
them
back
to
those
who
have
lost
them
we
will
then
immediately
leave
the
country
and
lead
a
better
life
we
are
protestants
and
the
bible
tells
us
that
we
can
not
be
saved
if
we
keep
in
our
hands
what
is
not
ours
you
do
not
know
us
but
we
know
you
well
you
are
the
only
man
in
quebec
to
whom
we
can
so
trust
our
lives
and
this
terrible
secret
we
have
worn
these
masks
that
you
may
not
know
us
and
that
you
may
not
be
compromised
if
you
are
ever
called
before
a
court
of
my
first
thought
was
to
leave
them
and
run
back
to
the
door
of
the
parsonage
but
such
an
act
of
cowardice
seemed
to
me
after
a
moment
s
reflection
unworthy
of
a
man
i
said
to
myself
these
two
men
can
not
come
to
steal
from
me
it
is
well
known
in
quebec
that
i
keep
myself
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
by
giving
all
i
have
to
the
poor
i
have
never
offended
any
man
in
my
life
that
i
know
they
can
not
come
to
punish
or
murder
me
they
are
protestants
and
they
trust
me
well
well
they
will
not
regret
to
have
put
their
trust
in
a
catholic
priest
i
then
answered
them
what
you
ask
from
me
is
of
a
very
delicate
and
even
dangerous
nature
before
i
do
it
i
want
to
take
the
advice
of
one
whom
i
consider
the
wisest
man
of
old
rev
demars
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
please
drive
me
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
seminary
if
that
venerable
man
advises
me
to
go
with
you
i
will
go
but
i
can
not
promise
to
grant
you
your
request
if
he
tells
me
not
to
all
right
they
both
said
and
in
a
very
short
time
i
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
seminary
a
few
moments
after
i
was
alone
in
the
room
of
demars
it
was
just
twelve
at
night
our
little
father
chiniquy
here
on
this
dark
night
at
twelve
what
does
this
mean
what
do
you
want
from
me
said
the
venerable
old
priest
i
come
to
ask
your
advice
i
answered
on
a
very
strange
thing
two
protestant
thieves
have
in
their
hands
a
great
quantity
of
the
silverware
stolen
these
last
three
years
they
want
to
deposit
them
in
my
hands
that
i
may
give
them
back
to
those
from
whom
they
have
been
stolen
before
they
leave
the
country
and
lead
a
better
life
i
can
not
know
them
for
they
both
wear
masks
i
can
not
even
know
where
they
take
me
for
the
carriage
is
so
completely
wrapped
up
by
curtains
that
it
is
impossible
to
see
outside
now
my
dear
demars
i
come
to
ask
your
advice
shall
i
go
with
them
or
not
but
remember
that
i
trust
you
with
these
things
under
the
seal
of
confession
that
neither
you
nor
i
may
be
before
answering
me
the
venerable
priest
said
i
am
very
old
but
i
have
never
heard
of
such
a
strange
thing
in
my
life
are
you
not
afraid
to
go
alone
with
these
two
thieves
in
that
covered
carriage
no
sir
i
answered
i
do
not
see
any
reason
to
fear
anything
from
these
two
well
well
rejoined
demars
if
you
are
not
afraid
under
such
circumstances
your
mother
has
given
you
a
brain
of
diamond
and
nerve
of
now
my
dear
sir
i
answered
time
flies
and
i
may
have
a
long
way
to
travel
with
these
two
men
please
in
the
shortest
possible
way
tell
me
your
mind
do
you
advise
me
to
go
with
them
he
replied
you
consult
me
on
a
very
difficult
matter
there
are
so
many
considerations
to
make
that
it
is
impossible
to
weigh
them
all
the
only
thing
we
have
to
do
is
to
pray
god
and
his
holy
mother
for
us
we
knelt
and
said
the
veni
sancte
spiritus
come
holy
spirit
which
prayer
ends
by
an
invocation
to
mary
as
mother
of
god
after
the
prayer
demars
again
asked
me
are
you
not
afraid
no
sir
i
do
not
see
any
reason
to
be
afraid
but
please
for
god
s
sake
hurry
on
tell
me
if
you
advise
me
to
go
and
accept
this
message
of
mercy
and
yes
go
go
if
you
are
not
afraid
answered
the
old
priest
with
a
voice
full
of
emotion
and
tears
in
his
eyes
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
said
before
i
start
please
give
me
your
blessing
and
pray
for
me
when
i
shall
be
on
my
way
to
that
strange
but
i
hope
good
i
left
the
seminary
and
took
my
seat
at
the
right
hand
of
one
of
my
unknown
companions
while
the
other
was
on
the
front
seat
driving
the
horse
not
a
word
was
said
by
any
of
us
on
the
way
but
i
perceived
that
the
stranger
who
was
at
my
left
was
praying
to
god
though
in
such
a
low
voice
that
i
understood
only
these
words
twice
repeated
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
a
sinner
these
words
touched
me
to
the
heart
and
brought
to
my
mind
the
dear
saviour
s
words
the
publicans
and
harlots
shall
go
into
the
kingdom
of
god
before
you
and
i
also
prayed
for
that
poor
repenting
sinner
and
for
myself
by
repeating
the
sublime
psalm
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
it
took
about
half
an
hour
to
reach
the
house
but
there
again
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
understand
where
i
was
for
the
carriage
was
brought
so
near
the
door
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
seeing
anything
beyond
the
carriage
and
the
horse
through
the
terrible
darkness
of
that
night
the
only
person
i
saw
when
in
the
house
was
a
tall
woman
covered
with
a
long
black
veil
whom
i
took
to
be
a
disguised
man
on
account
of
her
size
and
her
strength
for
she
was
carrying
very
heavy
bags
with
as
much
ease
as
if
they
had
been
a
handful
of
straw
there
was
only
a
small
candle
behind
a
screen
which
gave
so
little
light
that
everything
looked
like
phantoms
around
us
pictures
and
mirrors
were
all
turned
to
the
wall
and
presented
the
wrong
side
to
view
the
sofa
and
the
chairs
were
also
upset
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
impossible
to
identify
anything
of
what
i
had
seen
in
fact
i
could
see
nothing
in
that
house
not
a
word
was
said
except
by
one
of
my
companions
who
whispered
in
a
very
low
voice
please
look
at
the
tickets
which
are
on
every
bundle
they
will
indicate
to
whom
these
things
there
were
eight
bundles
the
heaviest
of
which
was
composed
of
the
melted
silver
of
the
statue
of
the
virgin
the
candlesticks
the
lamp
of
the
chapel
the
ciborium
a
couple
of
chalices
and
some
dozens
of
spoons
and
forks
the
other
bundles
were
made
up
of
silver
plates
fruit
baskets
tea
coffee
cream
and
sugar
pots
silver
spoons
and
forks
etc
as
soon
as
these
bundles
were
put
into
the
carriage
we
left
for
the
parsonage
where
we
arrived
a
little
before
the
dawn
of
day
not
a
word
was
exchanged
between
us
on
the
way
and
my
impression
was
that
my
penitent
companions
were
sending
their
silent
prayers
like
myself
to
the
feet
of
that
merciful
god
who
has
said
to
all
sinners
come
unto
me
all
ye
who
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
they
carried
the
bundles
into
my
trunk
which
i
locked
with
peculiar
attention
when
all
was
over
i
accompanied
them
to
the
door
to
take
leave
of
them
then
each
seizing
one
of
my
hands
by
a
spontaneous
movement
of
gratitude
and
joy
they
pressed
them
on
their
lips
shedding
tears
and
saying
in
a
low
voice
god
bless
you
a
thousand
times
for
the
good
work
you
have
just
performed
after
christ
you
are
our
as
these
two
men
were
speaking
it
pleased
god
to
send
forth
into
my
soul
one
of
those
rays
of
happiness
which
he
gives
us
only
at
great
intervals
i
believe
our
fragile
existence
would
soon
be
broken
up
were
we
by
such
joys
incessantly
inundated
those
two
men
had
ceased
to
be
robbers
in
my
eyes
they
were
dear
brethren
precious
friends
such
as
are
seldom
to
be
seen
the
narrow
and
shameful
prejudices
of
my
religion
were
silent
before
the
fervent
prayers
that
i
had
heard
from
their
lips
they
disappeared
in
those
tears
of
repentance
gratitude
and
love
which
fell
from
their
eyes
on
my
hands
night
surrounded
us
with
its
deepest
shades
but
our
souls
were
illuminated
with
a
light
purer
than
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
air
that
we
breathed
was
cold
and
damp
but
one
of
these
sparks
brought
down
from
heaven
by
jesus
to
warm
the
earth
had
fallen
into
our
hearts
and
we
were
all
penetrated
by
its
glow
i
pressed
their
hands
in
mine
saying
to
them
i
thank
and
bless
you
for
choosing
me
as
the
confident
of
your
misfortunes
and
repentance
to
you
i
owe
three
of
the
most
precious
hours
of
my
life
adieu
we
shall
see
one
another
no
more
on
this
earth
but
we
shall
meet
in
heaven
adieu
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
the
remainder
of
that
memorable
night
besides
i
had
in
my
possession
more
stolen
articles
than
would
have
caused
fifty
men
to
be
hanged
i
said
to
myself
what
would
become
of
me
if
the
police
were
to
break
in
on
me
and
find
all
that
i
have
in
my
hands
what
could
i
answer
if
i
were
asked
how
all
these
had
reached
me
did
i
not
go
beyond
the
bounds
of
prudence
in
what
i
have
just
done
have
i
not
indeed
slipped
a
rope
around
my
neck
though
my
conscience
did
not
reproach
me
with
any
thing
especially
when
i
had
acted
on
the
advice
of
a
man
as
wise
as
demars
yet
was
i
not
without
some
anxiety
and
i
longed
to
get
rid
of
all
the
things
i
had
by
giving
them
to
their
legitimate
owners
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
was
at
amiot
s
the
wealthiest
goldsmith
in
quebec
with
my
heavy
satchel
of
melted
silver
after
obtaining
from
him
a
promise
of
secrecy
i
handed
it
over
to
him
giving
him
at
the
same
time
its
history
i
asked
him
to
weigh
it
keep
its
contents
and
let
me
have
its
value
which
i
was
to
distribute
according
to
its
label
he
told
me
that
there
was
in
it
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
melted
silver
which
amount
he
immediately
gave
me
i
went
down
directly
to
give
about
half
of
it
to
rev
cazeault
chaplain
of
the
congregation
which
had
been
robbed
and
who
was
then
the
secretary
of
the
archbishop
of
quebec
and
i
distributed
the
remainder
to
the
parties
indicated
on
the
labels
attached
to
this
enormous
ingot
the
good
lady
montgomery
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
when
after
obtaining
also
from
her
the
promise
of
the
most
inviolable
secrecy
on
what
i
was
going
to
show
her
i
displayed
on
her
table
the
magnificent
dishes
of
massive
silver
fruit
baskets
tea
and
coffee
pots
sugar
bowls
cream
jugs
and
a
great
quantity
of
spoons
and
forks
of
the
finest
silver
which
had
been
taken
from
her
in
it
seemed
to
her
a
dream
which
brought
before
her
eyes
these
precious
family
relics
she
then
related
in
a
most
touching
manner
what
a
terrible
moment
she
had
passed
when
the
thieves
having
seized
her
with
her
maid
and
a
young
man
rolled
them
in
carpets
to
stifle
their
cries
whilst
they
were
breaking
locks
opening
chests
and
cupboards
to
carry
off
their
rich
contents
she
told
me
how
nearly
she
had
been
stifled
with
her
faithful
servants
under
the
enormous
weight
of
carpets
heaped
upon
them
by
the
robbers
this
excellent
lady
was
a
protestant
and
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
met
a
protestant
whose
piety
seemed
so
enlightened
and
sincere
i
could
not
help
admiring
her
when
she
had
most
sincerely
thanked
and
blessed
me
for
the
service
i
had
done
her
she
asked
if
i
would
have
any
objection
to
pray
with
her
and
to
aid
her
in
thanking
god
for
the
favor
he
had
just
shown
her
i
told
her
i
should
be
happy
in
uniting
with
her
to
bless
the
lord
for
his
mercies
upon
this
she
gave
me
a
bible
magnificently
bound
and
we
read
each
in
turn
a
verse
slowly
and
on
our
knees
the
sublime
psalm
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
etc
as
i
was
about
to
take
leave
of
her
she
offered
me
a
purse
containing
one
hundred
dollars
in
gold
which
i
refused
telling
her
that
i
would
rather
lose
my
two
hands
than
receive
a
cent
for
what
i
had
done
you
are
she
said
surrounded
with
poor
people
give
them
this
that
i
offer
to
the
lord
as
a
feeble
testimony
of
my
gratitude
and
be
assured
that
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
pray
god
to
pour
his
most
abounding
favors
upon
in
leaving
that
house
i
could
not
hide
from
myself
that
my
soul
had
been
embalmed
with
the
true
perfume
of
piety
that
i
had
never
seen
in
my
own
church
before
the
day
closed
i
had
given
back
to
their
rightful
owners
the
effects
left
in
my
hands
whose
value
amounted
to
more
than
and
had
my
receipts
in
good
form
i
am
glad
to
say
here
that
the
persons
most
of
whom
were
protestants
to
whom
i
made
these
restitutions
were
perfectly
honorable
and
that
not
a
single
one
of
them
ever
said
anything
to
compromise
me
in
this
matter
nor
was
i
ever
troubled
on
this
subject
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
give
my
venerable
friend
the
grand
vicar
demars
a
detailed
account
of
what
had
just
happened
he
heard
me
with
the
deepest
interest
and
could
not
retain
his
tears
when
i
related
the
touching
scene
of
my
separation
from
my
two
new
friends
that
night
one
of
the
nevertheless
has
remained
one
of
the
brightest
of
my
life
my
story
ended
he
said
i
am
indeed
very
old
but
i
must
confess
that
never
did
i
hear
anything
so
strange
and
so
beautiful
as
this
story
i
repeat
however
that
your
mother
must
have
given
you
a
brain
harder
than
diamond
and
nerves
more
solid
than
brass
not
to
have
been
afraid
during
this
very
singular
adventure
in
the
after
the
fatigues
and
incidents
of
the
last
hours
i
was
in
great
need
of
rest
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
sleep
a
single
instant
during
the
night
which
followed
for
the
first
time
i
stood
face
to
face
with
that
protestantism
which
my
church
had
taught
me
to
hate
and
fight
with
all
the
energy
that
heaven
had
bestowed
on
me
and
when
that
faith
had
been
by
the
hand
of
almighty
god
placed
in
the
scale
against
my
own
religion
it
appeared
as
a
heap
of
pure
gold
opposite
a
pile
of
rotten
rags
in
spite
of
myself
i
could
hear
incessantly
the
cries
of
grief
of
that
penitent
thief
lord
have
mercy
on
me
so
great
a
sinner
then
the
sublime
piety
of
lady
montgomery
the
blessings
she
had
asked
god
to
pour
on
me
his
unprofitable
servant
seemed
as
so
many
coals
of
fire
heaped
upon
my
head
by
god
to
punish
me
for
having
said
so
much
evil
of
protestants
and
so
often
decried
their
religion
a
secret
voice
arose
within
me
seest
thou
not
how
these
protestants
whom
thou
wishest
to
crush
with
thy
disdain
know
how
to
pray
repent
and
make
amends
for
their
faults
much
more
nobly
than
the
unfortunate
wretches
whom
thou
holdest
as
so
many
slaves
at
thy
feet
by
means
of
the
confessional
understandest
thou
not
that
the
spirit
of
god
the
grace
and
love
of
jesus
christ
produces
effectually
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
these
protestants
a
work
much
more
durable
than
thy
auricular
confession
compare
the
miserable
wiles
of
parent
who
makes
false
restitutions
to
cast
dust
into
the
eyes
of
the
unsuspecting
multitude
with
the
straightforwardness
noble
sincerity
and
admirable
wisdom
of
these
protestants
in
making
amends
for
their
wrongs
before
god
and
men
and
judge
for
thyself
which
of
those
two
religions
raise
in
order
to
save
and
which
degrades
in
order
to
destroy
the
guilty
has
ever
auricular
confession
worked
as
efficiently
on
sinners
as
the
bible
on
these
thieves
to
change
their
hearts
judge
this
day
by
their
fruits
which
of
the
two
religions
is
led
by
the
spirit
of
darkness
or
the
holy
ghost
not
wishing
to
condemn
my
religion
nor
allow
my
heart
to
be
attacked
by
protestantism
during
the
long
hours
of
that
restless
night
i
remained
anxious
humiliated
and
uneasy
it
is
thus
o
my
god
that
thou
madest
use
of
everything
even
these
thieves
to
shake
that
wonderful
fabric
of
errors
superstitions
and
falsehoods
that
rome
had
raised
in
my
soul
may
thy
name
be
forever
blessed
for
thy
mercies
towards
me
thy
unprofitable
servant

please
come

and
dark
cells
where
the
culprits
were
enchained
no
human
words
can
express
those
things
their
tears
and
their
sobs
were
going
through
my
heart
as
a
sword

at
first
his

dried

kept

you
know
that
i
am

i
am

penitent
you
have
persuaded
my
two
so
dear
sisters
to
give
up
their
protestantism
and
become
catholics
i
have
many
times
desired
to
follow
them
my
criminal
life
alone
has
prevented
me
from
doing
so
but
now
i
am
determined
to
do
what
i
consider
to
be
the
will
of
god
in
this
important
matter
please
tell
me
what
i
must
do
to
become
a
i
was
a
sincere
roman
catholic
priest
believing
that
out
of
the
church
of
rome
there
was
no
salvation
the
conversion
of
that
great
sinner
seemed
to
me
a
miracle
of
the
grace
of
god
it
was
for
me
a
happy
distraction
in
the
desolation
i
felt
in
that
dungeon
i
spent
the
next
eight
days
in
hearing
their
confessions
reading
the
lives
of
some
saints
with
several
chapters
of
the
bible
as
the
seven
penitential
psalms
the
sufferings
and
death
of
christ
the
history
of
the
prodigal
son
etc
and
i
instructed
chambers
as
well
as
the
shortness
of
the
time
allowed
me
in
the
faith
of
the
church
of
rome
i
usually
entered
the
cells
at
about
and
left
them
only
at
after
i
had
spent
much
time
in
exhorting
them
reading
and
praying
several
times
i
asked
them
to
tell
me
some
of
the
details
of
the
murders
and
thefts
they
had
committed
which
might
be
to
me
as
a
lesson
of
human
depravity
which
would
help
me
when
preaching
on
the
natural
corruption
and
malice
of
the
human
heart
when
once
the
fear
and
the
love
or
even
the
faith
in
god
were
completely
set
aside
the
facts
i
then
heard
very
soon
convinced
me
of
the
need
we
have
of
a
religion
and
what
would
become
of
the
world
if
the
atheists
could
succeed
in
sweeping
away
the
notions
of
a
future
punishment
after
death
or
the
fear
and
the
love
of
god
from
among
men
when
absolutely
left
to
his
own
depravity
without
any
religion
to
stop
him
on
the
rapid
declivity
of
his
uncontrollable
passions
man
is
more
cruel
than
the
wild
beasts
the
existence
of
society
would
simply
be
impossible
without
a
religion
and
a
god
to
protect
it
though
i
am
in
favor
of
liberty
of
conscience
in
its
highest
sense
i
think
that
the
atheist
ought
to
be
punished
like
the
murderer
and
the
his
doctrines
tend
to
make
a
murderer
and
a
thief
of
every
man
no
law
no
society
is
possible
if
there
is
no
god
to
sanction
and
protect
them
but
the
more
we
were
approaching
the
fatal
day
when
i
had
to
go
on
the
scaffold
with
those
unfortunate
men
and
to
see
them
launched
into
eternity
the
more
i
felt
horrified
the
tears
the
sobs
and
the
cries
of
those
unfortunate
men
had
so
melted
my
heart
my
soul
and
my
strong
nerves
they
had
so
subdued
my
unconquerable
will
and
that
stern
determination
to
do
my
duty
at
any
cost
which
had
been
my
character
till
then
that
i
was
shaking
from
head
to
feet
when
thinking
of
that
awful
hour
besides
that
my
constant
intercourse
with
those
criminals
these
last
few
days
their
unbounded
confidence
in
me
their
gratitude
for
my
devotedness
to
them
their
desolation
and
their
cries
when
speaking
of
their
fathers
or
mothers
wives
or
children
had
filled
my
heart
with
a
measure
of
sympathy
which
i
would
vainly
try
to
express
they
were
no
more
thieves
and
murderers
to
me
whose
bloody
deeds
had
at
first
chilled
the
blood
in
my
veins
they
were
the
friends
of
my
beloved
children
whom
cruel
beasts
had
wounded
they
were
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
only
i
felt
happy
to
mix
my
tears
with
theirs
and
unite
my
ardent
prayers
to
god
for
mercy
with
them
but
i
would
have
felt
happy
to
shed
my
blood
in
order
to
save
their
lives
as
several
of
them
belonged
to
the
most
reputable
families
of
quebec
and
vicinity
i
thought
i
could
easily
interest
the
clergy
and
the
most
respectable
citizens
to
sign
a
petition
to
the
governor
lord
gosford
asking
him
to
change
their
sentence
of
death
into
one
of
perpetual
exile
to
the
distant
penal
colony
of
botany
bay
in
australia
the
governor
was
my
friend
colonel
vassal
who
was
my
uncle
and
the
of
the
militia
of
the
whole
country
had
introduced
me
to
his
excellency
who
many
times
had
overloaded
me
with
the
marks
of
his
interest
and
kindness
and
my
hope
was
that
he
would
not
refuse
me
the
favor
i
was
to
ask
him
when
the
petition
would
be
signed
by
the
bishop
the
catholic
priests
the
ministers
of
the
different
protestant
denominations
of
the
city
and
hundreds
of
the
principal
citizens
of
quebec
i
presented
the
petition
myself
accompanied
by
the
secretary
of
the
archbishop
but
to
my
great
distress
the
governor
answered
me
that
those
men
had
committed
so
many
murders
and
kept
the
country
in
terror
for
so
many
years
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
they
should
be
punished
according
to
the
sentence
of
the
court
who
can
tell
the
desolation
of
those
unfortunate
men
when
with
a
voice
choked
by
my
sobs
and
my
tears
i
told
them
that
the
governor
had
refused
to
grant
the
favor
i
had
asked
him
for
them
they
fell
on
the
ground
and
filled
their
cells
with
cries
which
would
have
broken
the
hardest
heart
from
those
very
cells
we
were
hearing
the
noise
of
the
men
who
were
preparing
the
scaffold
where
they
were
to
be
hanged
the
next
day
i
tried
to
pray
and
read
but
was
unable
to
do
so
my
desolation
was
too
great
to
utter
a
single
word
i
felt
as
if
i
were
to
be
hanged
with
to
say
the
whole
truth
i
think
i
would
have
been
glad
to
hear
that
i
was
to
be
hanged
the
next
day
to
save
their
lives
for
there
was
a
fear
in
me
which
was
haunting
me
as
a
phantom
from
hell
the
last
three
days
it
seemed
that
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
prayers
confessions
absolutions
and
sacraments
these
men
were
not
converted
and
that
they
were
to
be
launched
into
eternity
with
all
their
sins
when
i
was
comparing
the
calm
and
true
repentance
of
the
two
thieves
with
whom
i
spent
the
night
a
few
weeks
before
in
the
carriage
with
the
noisy
expressions
of
sorrow
of
these
newly
converted
sinners
i
could
not
help
finding
an
immeasurable
distance
between
the
first
and
the
second
of
those
penitents
no
doubt
had
remained
in
my
mind
about
the
first
but
i
had
serious
apprehensions
about
the
last
several
circumstances
which
it
would
be
too
long
and
useless
to
mention
here
were
depressing
me
by
the
fear
that
all
my
chaplets
indulgences
medals
scapulars
holy
waters
signs
of
the
cross
prayers
to
the
virgin
auricular
confessions
absolutions
used
in
the
conversion
of
these
sinners
had
not
the
divine
and
perfect
power
of
a
simple
look
to
the
dying
saviour
on
the
cross
i
was
saying
to
myself
with
anxiety
would
it
be
possible
that
those
protestants
who
were
with
me
in
the
carriage
had
the
true
ways
of
repentance
pardon
peace
and
life
eternal
in
that
simple
look
to
the
great
victim
and
that
we
roman
catholics
with
our
signs
of
the
cross
and
holy
waters
our
crucifixes
and
prayers
to
the
saints
our
scapulars
and
medals
our
so
humiliating
auricular
confession
were
only
distracting
the
mind
the
soul
and
the
heart
of
the
sinner
from
the
true
and
only
source
of
salvation
christ
in
the
midst
of
those
distressing
thoughts
i
almost
regretted
having
helped
chambers
in
giving
up
his
protestantism
for
my
romanism
at
about
i
made
a
supreme
effort
to
shake
off
my
desolation
and
nerve
myself
for
the
solemn
duties
god
had
intrusted
to
me
i
put
a
few
questions
to
those
desolated
men
to
see
if
they
were
really
repentant
and
converted
their
answers
added
to
my
fears
that
i
had
spoken
too
much
of
the
virgins
and
the
saints
the
indulgences
medals
and
scapulars
integrity
of
confession
and
not
enough
of
christ
dying
on
the
cross
for
them
it
is
true
i
had
spoken
of
christ
and
his
death
to
them
but
this
had
been
so
much
mixed
up
with
exhortation
to
trust
in
mary
put
their
confidence
in
their
medals
scapulars
confessions
that
it
became
almost
evident
to
me
that
in
our
religion
christ
was
like
a
precious
pearl
lost
in
a
mountain
of
sand
and
dust
this
fear
soon
caused
my
distress
to
be
unbearable
i
then
went
to
the
private
neat
little
room
which
the
gaoler
had
kindly
allotted
to
me
and
i
fell
on
my
knees
to
pray
god
for
myself
and
for
my
poor
convicts
though
this
prayer
brought
some
calm
to
my
mind
my
distress
was
still
very
great
it
was
then
that
the
thought
came
again
to
my
mind
to
go
to
the
governor
and
make
a
new
and
supreme
effort
to
have
the
sentence
of
death
changed
into
that
of
perpetual
exile
to
botany
bay
and
without
a
moment
of
delay
i
went
to
his
palace
it
was
about
when
he
reluctantly
admitted
me
to
his
presence
telling
me
when
shaking
hands
i
hope
chiniquy
you
are
not
coming
to
renew
your
request
of
the
morning
for
i
can
not
grant
without
a
word
of
answer
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
for
more
than
ten
minutes
i
spoke
as
i
had
never
spoken
before
i
spoke
as
we
speak
when
we
are
the
ambassadors
of
god
in
a
message
of
mercy
i
spoke
with
my
lips
i
spoke
with
my
tears
i
spoke
with
my
sobs
and
cries
i
spoke
with
my
supplicating
hands
lifted
to
heaven
for
some
time
the
governor
was
mute
and
as
if
stunned
he
was
not
only
a
man
but
he
had
a
most
tender
affectionate
and
kind
heart
his
tears
soon
began
to
flow
with
mine
and
his
sobs
mixed
with
my
sobs
with
a
voice
half
suffocated
by
his
emotion
he
extended
his
friendly
hand
and
said
father
chiniquy
you
ask
me
a
favor
which
i
ought
not
to
give
but
i
can
not
resist
your
arguments
when
your
tears
your
sobs
and
your
cries
are
like
arrows
which
pierce
and
break
my
heart
i
will
give
you
the
favor
you
it
was
nearly
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
gaoler
asking
his
permission
to
see
my
dear
friends
in
their
cells
to
tell
them
that
i
had
obtained
their
pardon
that
they
would
not
die
that
gentleman
could
hardly
believe
me
it
was
only
after
reading
twice
the
document
i
had
in
my
hands
that
he
saw
that
i
told
him
the
truth
looking
at
the
parchment
again
he
said
have
you
noticed
that
it
is
covered
and
almost
spoiled
by
the
spots
evidently
made
with
the
tears
of
the
governor
you
must
be
a
kind
of
a
sorcerer
to
have
melted
the
heart
of
such
a
man
and
have
wrenched
from
his
hands
the
pardon
of
such
convicts
for
i
know
he
was
absolutely
unwilling
to
grant
the
i
am
not
a
sorcerer
i
answered
but
you
remember
that
our
saviour
jesus
christ
had
said
somewhere
that
he
had
brought
a
fire
from
it
is
evident
that
he
has
thrown
some
sparks
of
that
fire
into
my
poor
heart
for
it
was
so
fiercely
burning
when
i
was
at
the
feet
of
the
governor
that
i
think
i
would
have
died
at
his
feet
had
he
not
granted
me
that
favor
no
doubt
that
some
sparks
of
that
fire
have
also
fallen
on
his
soul
and
in
his
heart
when
i
was
speaking
for
his
cries
his
tears
and
his
sobs
were
filling
his
room
and
showing
that
he
was
suffering
as
well
as
myself
it
was
that
he
might
not
be
consumed
by
that
fire
that
he
granted
my
request
i
am
now
the
most
happy
man
under
heaven
please
make
haste
come
with
me
and
open
the
cells
of
those
unfortunate
men
that
i
may
tell
what
our
merciful
god
has
done
for
when
entering
their
desolated
cells
i
was
unable
to
contain
myself
i
cried
out
rejoice
and
bless
the
lord
my
dear
friends
you
will
not
die
i
bring
you
your
pardon
with
me
two
of
them
fainted
and
came
very
near
dying
from
excess
of
surprise
and
joy
the
others
unable
to
contain
their
emotions
were
crying
and
weeping
for
joy
they
threw
their
arms
around
me
to
press
me
to
their
bosom
kiss
my
hands
and
cover
them
with
their
tears
of
joy
i
knelt
with
them
and
thanked
god
after
which
i
told
them
how
they
must
promise
to
god
to
serve
him
faithfully
after
such
a
manifestation
of
his
mercies
i
read
to
them
the
and
psalms
and
i
left
them
after
twelve
o
clock
at
night
to
go
and
take
some
rest
i
was
in
need
of
it
after
a
whole
day
of
such
work
and
emotions
the
next
day
i
wanted
to
see
my
dear
prisoners
early
and
i
was
with
them
at
as
the
whole
country
had
been
glad
to
hear
that
they
were
to
be
hanged
that
very
day
the
crowds
were
beginning
to
gather
at
that
early
hour
to
witness
the
death
of
those
great
culprits
the
feelings
of
indignation
were
almost
unmanageable
when
they
heard
that
they
were
not
to
be
hanged
but
only
to
be
exiled
for
their
life
to
botany
bay
for
a
time
it
was
feared
that
the
mob
would
break
the
doors
of
the
gaol
and
lynch
the
culprits
though
very
few
priests
were
more
respected
and
loved
by
the
people
they
would
have
probably
torn
me
into
pieces
when
they
heard
that
it
was
i
who
had
deprived
the
gibbet
of
its
victims
that
day
the
chief
of
police
had
to
take
extraordinary
measures
to
prevent
the
wrath
of
the
mob
from
doing
mischief
he
advised
me
not
to
show
myself
for
a
few
days
in
the
streets
more
than
a
month
passed
before
all
the
thieves
and
murderers
in
canada
to
the
number
of
about
seventy
who
had
been
sentenced
to
be
exiled
to
botany
bay
could
be
gathered
into
the
ship
which
was
to
take
them
into
that
distant
land
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
during
that
interval
to
visit
my
penitents
in
gaol
every
day
and
instruct
them
on
the
duties
of
the
new
life
they
were
called
upon
to
live
when
the
day
of
their
departure
arrived
i
gave
a
roman
catholic
new
testament
translated
by
desacy
to
each
of
them
to
read
and
meditate
on
their
long
and
tedious
journey
and
i
bade
them
adieu
recommending
them
to
the
mercy
of
god
and
the
protection
of
the
virgin
mary
and
all
the
saints
some
months
later
i
heard
that
on
the
sea
chambers
had
cut
loose
his
chains
and
those
of
some
of
his
companions
with
the
intention
of
taking
possession
of
the
ship
and
escaping
on
some
distant
shore
but
he
had
been
betrayed
and
was
hanged
on
his
arrival
at
liverpool
i
had
almost
lost
sight
of
those
emotional
days
of
my
young
years
of
priesthood
those
facts
were
silently
lying
among
the
big
piles
of
the
daily
records
which
i
had
faithfully
kept
since
the
very
days
of
my
collegiate
life
at
nicolet
when
in
the
rev
george
sutherland
presbyterian
minister
of
sydney
invited
me
in
the
name
of
the
orangemen
and
many
other
christians
of
that
great
country
to
go
and
lecture
in
australia
they
accompanied
their
invitation
with
a
check
of
for
the
traveling
expenses
from
chicago
to
that
distant
land
and
i
accepted
their
kind
invitation
some
time
after
my
arrival
when
i
was
lecturing
in
one
of
the
young
and
thriving
cities
of
that
country
whose
future
destinies
promise
to
be
so
great
a
rich
carross
drawn
by
two
splendid
english
horses
driven
by
two
men
stopped
before
the
house
where
i
had
put
up
for
a
few
days
a
venerable
gentleman
alighted
from
the
carriage
and
knocked
at
the
door
as
i
was
looking
at
him
from
the
window
i
went
to
the
door
to
save
trouble
to
my
host
and
i
opened
it
in
saluting
me
the
stranger
said
is
father
chiniquy

answered
father
chiniquy

the
guest
of
this
could
i
have
the
honor
of
a
few
minute
s
conversation
with
him

the
old
gentleman

can
at
once
answer
you
that
i
will
feel
much
pleasure
in
granting

stranger

half
an
hour
without

comfortable
rooms

the
stranger
said

answered

not
even

not
only
seen
me
but

heard
the
confession
of
my
sins
many
times
and
you
have
spent
many
hours
in
the
same
room

me

the
old
gentleman

murderer

condemned
to
death
in
quebec
in
with
eight
of
his
accomplices
asked
the
stranger
yes

remember
well

and
the
unfortunate
men
he
was
leading
in
the
ways
of
iniquity
i
replied
well
dear
father
chiniquy
i
am
one
of
the
criminals
who
filled
canada
with
terror
for
several
years
and
who
were
caught
and
rightly
condemned
to
death
when
condemned
we
selected
you
for
our
father
confessor
with
the
hope
that
through
your
influence
we
might
escape
the
gallows
and
we
were
not
disappointed
you
obtained
our
pardon
the
sentence
of
death
was
commuted
into
a
life
of
exile
to
botany
bay
my
name
in
canada
was
but
here
they
call
me
god
has
blessed
me
since
in
many
ways
but
it
is
to
you
i
owe
my
life
and
all
the
privileges
of
my
present
existence
after
god
you
are
my
saviour
i
come
to
thank
and
bless
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
in
saying
that
he
threw
himself
into
my
arms
pressed
me
to
his
heart
and
bathed
my
face
and
my
hands
with
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
but
his
joy
did
not
exceed
mine
and
my
surprise
was
equal
to
my
joy
to
find
him
apparently
in
such
good
circumstances
after
i
had
knelt
with
him
to
thank
and
bless
god
for
what
i
had
heard
i
asked
him
to
relate
to
me
the
details
of
his
strange
and
marvellous
story
here
is
a
short
of
his
answer
after
you
had
given
us
your
last
benediction
when
on
board
the
ship
which
was
to
take
us
from
quebec
to
botany
bay
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
open
the
new
testament
you
had
given
me
and
the
other
culprits
with
the
advice
to
read
it
with
a
praying
heart
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
had
that
book
in
my
hand
you
were
the
only
priest
in
canada
who
would
put
such
a
book
in
the
hands
of
common
people
but
i
must
confess
that
its
first
reading
did
not
do
me
much
good
for
i
read
it
more
to
amuse
myself
and
satisfy
my
curiosity
than
through
any
good
and
christian
motive
the
only
good
i
received
from
that
first
reading
was
that
i
clearly
understood
for
the
first
time
why
the
priests
of
rome
fear
and
hate
that
book
and
why
they
take
it
out
of
the
hands
of
their
parishioners
when
they
hear
that
they
have
it
it
was
in
vain
that
i
looked
for
mass
indulgence
chaplets
purgatory
auricular
confession
lent
holy
waters
the
worship
of
mary
or
prayers
in
an
unknown
tongue
i
concluded
from
my
first
reading
of
the
gospel
that
our
priests
were
very
wise
to
prevent
us
from
reading
a
book
which
was
really
demolishing
our
roman
catholic
church
and
felt
surprised
that
you
had
put
in
our
hands
a
book
which
seemed
to
me
so
opposed
to
the
belief
and
practice
of
our
religion
as
you
taught
it
to
us
when
in
gaol
and
my
confidence
in
your
good
judgment
was
much
shaken
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
first
reading
of
the
gospel
went
far
to
demolish
my
roman
catholic
faith
and
to
make
a
wreck
of
the
religion
taught
me
by
my
parents
and
at
the
college
and
even
by
you
for
a
few
weeks
i
became
more
of
a
skeptic
than
anything
else
the
only
good
that
first
reading
of
the
holy
book
did
me
was
to
give
me
more
serious
thoughts
and
prevent
me
from
uniting
myself
to
chambers
and
his
conspirators
in
their
foolish
plot
for
taking
possession
of
the
ship
and
escaping
to
some
unknown
and
distant
shore
he
had
been
shrewd
enough
to
conceal
a
very
small
but
exceedingly
sharp
saw
between
his
toes
before
coming
to
the
ship
with
which
he
had
already
cut
the
chains
of
eighteen
of
the
prisoners
when
he
was
betrayed
and
hanged
on
his
arrival
at
liverpool
but
if
my
first
reading
of
the
gospel
did
not
do
me
much
good
i
can
not
say
the
same
thing
of
the
second
i
remember
that
when
handing
to
us
that
holy
book
you
had
told
us
never
to
read
it
except
after
a
fervent
prayer
to
god
for
help
and
light
to
understand
it
i
was
really
tired
of
my
former
life
in
giving
up
the
fear
and
the
love
of
god
i
had
fallen
into
the
deepest
abyss
of
human
depravity
and
misery
till
i
had
come
very
near
ending
my
life
on
the
scaffold
i
felt
the
need
of
a
change
you
had
often
repeated
to
us
the
words
of
our
saviour
come
unto
me
all
ye
who
are
weary
and
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
but
with
all
the
other
priests
you
had
always
mixed
those
admirable
and
saving
words
with
the
invocation
of
mary
the
confidence
in
our
medals
scapulars
signs
of
the
cross
holy
waters
indulgences
auricular
confessions
that
the
sublime
appeal
of
christ
had
always
been
as
it
always
will
be
drowned
in
the
church
of
rome
by
those
absurd
and
impious
superstitions
and
practices
one
morning
after
i
had
spent
a
sleepless
night
and
feeling
as
pressed
down
under
the
weight
of
my
sins
i
opened
my
gospel
book
after
an
ardent
prayer
for
light
and
guidance
and
my
eyes
fell
on
these
words
of
john
here
is
the
lamb
of
god
who
takes
away
the
sins
of
the
world
these
words
fell
upon
my
poor
guilty
soul
with
a
divine
irresistible
power
with
tears
and
cries
of
an
unspeakable
desolation
i
spent
the
day
in
crying
o
lamb
of
god
who
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
have
mercy
upon
me
take
away
my
sins
the
day
was
not
over
when
i
felt
and
knew
that
my
cries
had
been
heard
at
the
the
lamb
of
god
had
taken
away
my
sins
he
had
changed
my
heart
and
made
quite
a
new
man
of
me
from
that
day
the
reading
of
the
gospel
was
to
my
soul
what
bread
is
to
the
poor
hungry
man
and
what
pure
and
refreshing
waters
are
to
the
thirsty
traveler
my
joy
my
unspeakable
joy
was
to
read
the
holy
book
and
speak
with
my
companions
in
chains
of
the
dear
saviour
s
love
for
the
poor
sinners
and
thanks
be
to
god
a
good
number
of
them
have
found
him
altogether
precious
and
have
been
sincerely
converted
in
the
dark
holds
of
that
ship
when
working
hard
at
sydney
with
the
other
culprits
i
felt
my
chains
to
be
as
light
as
feathers
when
i
was
sure
that
the
heavy
chains
of
my
sins
were
gone
and
though
working
hard
under
a
burning
sun
from
morning
till
night
i
felt
happy
and
my
heart
was
full
of
joy
when
i
was
sure
that
my
saviour
had
prepared
a
throne
for
me
in
his
kingdom
and
that
he
had
brought
a
crown
of
eternal
glory
for
me
by
dying
on
the
cross
to
redeem
my
guilty
soul
i
had
hardly
spent
a
year
in
australia
in
the
midst
of
the
convicts
when
a
minister
of
the
gospel
accompanied
by
another
gentleman
came
to
me
and
said
your
perfectly
good
behavior
and
your
christian
life
has
attracted
the
attention
and
admiration
of
the
authorities
and
the
governor
sends
us
to
hand
you
this
document
which
says
you
are
no
more
a
criminal
before
the
law
but
that
you
have
your
pardon
and
you
can
live
the
life
of
an
honorable
citizen
by
continuing
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
after
speaking
so
the
gentlemen
put
one
hundred
dollars
in
my
hands
and
added
go
and
be
a
faithful
follower
of
the
lord
jesus
and
god
almighty
will
bless
you
and
make
you
prosper
in
all
your
all
this
seemed
to
me
as
a
dream
or
vision
from
heaven
i
would
hardly
believe
my
ears
and
my
eyes
but
it
was
not
a
dream
it
was
a
reality
my
merciful
heavenly
father
had
again
heard
my
humble
supplications
after
having
taken
away
the
heavy
chains
of
my
sins
he
had
mercifully
taken
away
the
chains
which
wounded
my
feet
and
my
hands
i
spent
several
days
and
nights
in
weeping
and
crying
for
joy
and
in
blessing
the
god
of
my
salvation
jesus
the
redeemer
of
my
soul
and
my
body
some
years
after
that
we
heard
of
the
discoveries
of
the
rich
gold
mines
in
several
parts
of
australia
after
having
prayed
god
to
guide
me
i
bought
a
bag
of
hard
crackers
a
ham
and
cheese
and
started
for
the
mines
in
company
with
several
who
were
going
like
myself
in
search
of
gold
but
i
soon
preferred
to
be
alone
for
i
wanted
to
pray
and
to
be
united
to
my
god
even
when
walking
after
a
long
march
i
reached
a
beautiful
spot
between
three
small
hills
at
the
foot
of
which
a
little
brook
was
running
down
toward
the
plain
below
the
sun
was
scorching
there
was
no
shade
and
i
was
much
tired
i
sat
on
a
flat
stone
to
take
my
dinner
and
quenched
my
thirst
with
the
water
of
the
brook
i
was
eating
and
blessing
my
god
at
the
same
time
for
his
mercies
when
suddenly
my
eyes
fell
on
a
stone
by
the
brook
which
was
about
the
size
of
a
goose
egg
but
the
rays
of
the
sun
were
dancing
on
the
stone
as
if
it
had
been
a
mirror
i
went
and
picked
it
up
the
stone
was
almost
all
gold
of
the
purest
kind
it
was
almost
enough
to
make
me
rich
i
knelt
to
thank
and
bless
god
for
this
new
token
of
his
mercy
toward
me
and
i
began
to
look
around
to
see
if
i
could
not
find
some
new
pieces
of
the
precious
metal
and
you
may
imagine
my
joy
when
i
found
that
the
ground
was
not
only
literally
covered
with
pieces
of
gold
of
every
size
from
half
an
inch
to
the
smallest
dimensions
but
that
the
very
sand
in
great
part
was
composed
of
gold
in
a
very
short
time
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
i
could
carry
to
the
bank
particles
of
gold
to
the
value
of
several
thousand
pounds
i
continued
to
cover
myself
with
rags
and
have
old
boots
on
in
order
not
to
excite
the
suspicion
of
any
one
on
the
fortune
which
i
was
accumulating
so
rapidly
when
i
had
about
deposited
in
the
banks
a
gentleman
offered
me
more
for
my
claim
and
i
sold
it
the
money
was
invested
by
me
on
a
piece
of
land
which
soon
became
the
site
of
an
important
city
and
i
soon
became
one
of
the
wealthy
men
of
australia
i
then
began
to
study
hard
and
improve
the
little
education
i
had
received
in
canada
i
married
and
my
god
has
made
me
father
of
several
children
the
people
where
i
settled
with
my
fortune
and
wife
not
knowing
my
antecedents
have
raised
me
to
the
first
dignities
of
the
place
please
dear
chiniquy
come
and
take
dinner
with
me
that
i
may
show
you
my
house
and
some
of
my
other
properties
and
also
that
i
may
introduce
you
to
my
wife
and
children
but
let
me
ask
the
favor
not
to
make
them
suspect
that
you
have
known
me
in
canada
for
they
think
i
am
an
when
telling
me
his
marvellous
adventures
which
i
am
obliged
to
condense
and
abridge
his
voice
was
many
times
choked
by
his
emotion
his
tears
and
his
sobs
and
more
than
once
he
had
to
stop
as
for
me
i
was
absolutely
beside
myself
with
admiration
at
the
mysterious
ways
through
which
god
leads
his
elect
in
all
ages
now
i
understand
why
my
god
had
given
me
such
a
marvellous
power
over
the
governor
of
canada
when
i
wrenched
your
pardon
from
his
hands
almost
in
spite
of
himself
i
said
that
merciful
god
wanted
to
save
you
and
you
are
saved
may
his
name
be
forever
the
next
day
it
was
my
privilege
to
be
with
his
family
at
dinner
and
never
have
i
seen
a
more
happy
mother
and
a
more
interesting
family
the
long
table
was
actually
surrounded
by
them
after
dinner
he
showed
me
his
beautiful
garden
and
his
rich
palace
after
which
throwing
himself
into
my
arms
he
said
dear
father
chiniquy
all
those
things
belong
to
you
it
is
to
you
after
god
that
i
owe
my
life
all
the
blessings
of
a
large
and
christian
family
and
the
honor
of
the
high
position
i
have
in
this
country
may
the
god
of
heaven
for
ever
bless
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
i
answered
him
dear
friend
you
owe
me
nothing
i
have
been
nothing
but
a
feeble
instrument
of
the
mercies
of
god
toward
you
to
that
great
and
merciful
god
alone
be
the
praise
and
the
glory
please
ask
your
family
to
come
here
and
join
with
us
in
singing
to
the
praise
of
god
the
and
we
sang
together
praise
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
let
all
that
is
within
me
praise
his
holy
name
he
hath
not
dealt
with
us
after
our
sins
nor
rewarded
us
according
to
our
iniquities
for
as
the
heaven
is
high
above
the
earth
so
great
is
his
mercy
toward
them
that
fear
him
as
far
as
the
east
is
from
the
west
so
far
hath
he
removed
our
transgressions
from
us
like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children
so
the
lord
pitieth
them
that
fear
after
the
singing
of
that
hymn
i
bade
him
adieu
for
the
second
time
never
to
meet
him
again
except
in
that
promised
land
where
we
will
sing
the
eternal
alleluia
around
the
throne
of
the
lamb
who
was
slain
for
us
and
who
redeemed
us

his
blood

with
the
victims
of
a
fever
of
the
worst
kind
which
soon
turned
into
an
epidemic
within
the
walls
of
that
institution
glackmeyer
the
superintendent
with
two
of
the
attending
doctors
and
the
majority
of
the
servants
were
swept
away
during
the
winter
months
i
was
in
the
spring
of
almost
the
only
one
spared
by
that
horrible
pest
in
order
not
to
spread
terror
among
the
citizens
of
quebec
the
physicians
and
i
had
determined
to
keep
that
a
secret
but
at
the
end
of
may
i
was
forced
to
reveal
it
to
the
bishop
of
quebec
my
lord
signaie
for
i
felt
in
my
whole
frame
the
first
symptoms
of
the
merciless
disease
i
prepared
myself
to
die
as
very
few
who
had
been
attacked
by
it
had
escaped
i
went
to
the
bishop
told
him
the
truth
about
the
epidemic
and
requested
him
to
appoint
a
priest
immediately
as
chaplain
in
my
place
for
i
added
i
feel
the
poison
running
through
my
veins
and
it
is
very
probable
that
i
have
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
days
to
live
the
young
mons
estimanville
was
chosen
and
though
i
felt
very
weak
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
initiate
him
in
his
new
and
perilous
work
i
took
him
immediately
to
the
hospital
where
he
never
had
been
before
and
when
at
a
few
feet
from
the
door
i
said
my
young
friend
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
there
is
a
dangerous
epidemic
raging
in
that
house
since
last
fall
nothing
has
been
able
to
stop
it
the
superintendent
two
physicians
and
most
of
the
servants
have
been
its
victims
my
escape
till
now
is
almost
miraculous
but
these
last
ten
hours
i
feel
the
poison
running
through
my
whole
body
you
are
called
by
god
to
take
my
place
but
before
you
cross
the
threshold
of
that
hospital
you
must
make
the
generous
sacrifice
of
your
life
for
you
are
going
on
a
from
which
only
few
have
come
out
with
their
the
young
priest
turned
pale
and
said
is
it
possible
that
such
a
deadly
epidemic
is
raging
where
you
are
taking
me
i
answered
yes
my
dear
young
brother
it
is
a
fact
and
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
not
to
enter
that
house
if
you
are
afraid
to
die
a
few
minutes
of
silence
followed
and
it
was
a
solemn
silence
indeed
did
the
angels
of
god
appear
to
show
him
the
crown
given
to
those
who
die
for
their
brethren
i
do
not
know
what
i
do
know
is
that
a
few
months
later
that
young
priest
won
the
glorious
crown
by
falling
at
his
post
of
duty
he
then
took
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
away
some
big
drops
of
sweat
which
were
rolling
from
his
forehead
on
his
cheeks
and
said
is
there
a
more
holy
and
desirable
way
of
dying
than
in
ministering
to
the
spiritual
and
temporal
wants
of
my
brethren
no
if
it
is
the
will
of
god
that
i
should
fall
when
fighting
at
this
post
of
danger
i
am
ready
let
his
holy
will
be
he
followed
me
into
the
pestilential
house
with
the
heroic
step
of
the
soldier
who
runs
at
the
command
of
his
general
to
storm
an
impregnable
citadel
when
he
is
sure
to
fall
it
took
me
more
than
an
hour
to
show
him
all
the
rooms
and
introduce
him
to
the
poor
but
very
dear
sick
and
dying
mariners
i
felt
then
so
exhausted
that
two
friends
had
to
support
me
on
my
return
to
the
parsonage
of
roch
my
physicians
were
immediately
called
one
of
them
rousseau
is
still
living
and
soon
pronounced
my
case
so
dangerous
that
three
other
physicians
were
called
in
consultation
for
nine
days
i
suffered
the
most
horrible
tortures
in
my
brains
and
the
very
marrow
of
my
bones
from
the
fever
which
so
devoured
my
flesh
as
to
seemingly
leave
but
the
skin
on
the
ninth
day
the
physicians
told
the
bishop
who
had
visited
me
that
there
was
no
hope
for
my
recovery
the
last
sacraments
were
administered
to
me
and
i
prepared
myself
to
die
as
taught
by
the
church
of
rome
the
tenth
day
i
was
absolutely
motionless
and
not
able
to
utter
a
word
my
tongue
was
parched
like
a
piece
of
dry
wood
through
the
terrible
ravage
on
the
whole
system
my
very
eyes
were
so
turned
inside
their
orbits
the
white
part
only
could
be
seen
no
food
could
be
taken
from
the
beginning
of
the
sickness
except
a
few
drops
of
cold
water
which
were
dropped
through
my
teeth
with
much
difficulty
but
though
all
my
physical
faculties
seemed
dead
my
memory
and
my
intelligence
were
full
of
life
and
acting
with
more
power
than
ever
now
and
then
in
the
paroxysms
of
the
fever
i
used
to
see
awful
visions
at
one
time
suspended
by
a
thread
at
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
with
my
head
down
over
a
bottomless
abyss
at
another
surrounded
by
merciless
enemies
whose
daggers
and
swords
were
plunged
through
my
body
but
these
were
of
short
duration
though
they
have
left
such
an
impression
on
my
mind
that
i
still
remember
the
minutest
details
death
had
at
first
no
terrors
for
me
i
had
done
to
the
best
of
my
ability
all
that
my
church
had
told
me
to
do
to
be
saved
i
had
every
day
given
my
last
cent
to
the
poor
fasted
and
done
penance
almost
enough
to
kill
myself
made
my
confessions
with
the
greatest
care
and
sincerity
preached
with
such
zeal
and
earnestness
as
to
fill
the
whole
city
with
admiration
my
pharisaical
virtues
and
holiness
in
a
word
were
of
such
a
glaring
and
deceitful
character
and
my
ecclesiastical
superiors
were
so
taken
by
them
that
they
made
the
greatest
efforts
to
persuade
me
to
become
the
first
bishop
of
oregon
and
vancouver
one
after
the
other
all
the
saints
of
heaven
beginning
with
the
holy
virgin
mary
were
invoked
by
me
that
they
might
pray
god
to
look
down
upon
me
in
mercy
and
save
my
soul
on
the
thirteenth
night
as
the
doctors
were
retiring
they
whispered
to
the
revs
baillargeon
and
parent
who
were
at
my
bedside
he
is
dead
or
if
not
he
has
only
a
few
minutes
to
live
he
is
already
cold
and
breathless
and
we
can
not
feel
his
though
these
words
had
been
said
in
a
very
low
tone
they
fell
upon
my
ears
as
a
peal
of
thunder
the
two
young
priests
who
were
my
devoted
friends
filled
the
room
with
such
cries
that
the
curate
and
the
priest
who
had
gone
to
rest
rushed
to
my
room
and
mingled
their
tears
and
cries
with
theirs
the
words
of
the
doctor
he
is
dead
were
ringing
in
my
ears
as
the
voice
of
a
hurricane
i
suddenly
saw
that
i
was
in
danger
of
being
buried
alive
no
words
can
express
the
sense
of
horror
i
felt
at
that
idea
a
cold
icy
wave
began
to
move
slowly
but
it
seemed
to
me
with
irresistible
force
from
the
extremities
of
my
feet
and
hands
toward
the
heart
as
the
first
symptoms
of
approaching
death
at
that
moment
i
made
a
great
effort
to
see
what
hope
i
might
have
of
being
saved
invoking
the
help
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
with
lightning
rapidity
a
terrible
vision
struck
my
mind
i
saw
all
my
good
works
and
penances
in
which
my
church
had
told
me
to
trust
for
salvation
in
the
balance
of
the
justice
of
god
these
were
in
one
side
of
the
scales
and
my
sins
on
the
other
my
good
works
seemed
only
as
a
grain
of
sand
compared
with
the
weight
of
my
sins
b
footnote
b
in
order
to
be
understood
by
those
of
my
readers
who
have
never
been
deceived
by
the
diabolical
doctrines
of
the
church
of
rome
i
must
say
here
that
when
young
i
had
learned
all
my
catechism
and
when
a
priest
i
had
believed
and
preached
what
rome
says
on
that
subject
here
is
her
doctrine
as
taught
in
her
catechism
who
are
those
who
go
to
heaven
ans
those
only
who
have
never
offended
god
or
who
having
offended
him
have
done
this
awful
vision
entirely
destroyed
my
false
and
pharisaical
security
and
filled
my
soul
with
an
unspeakable
terror
i
could
not
cry
to
jesus
christ
nor
to
god
his
father
for
mercy
for
i
sincerely
believed
what
my
church
had
taught
me
on
that
subject
that
they
were
both
angry
with
me
on
account
of
my
sins
with
much
anxiety
i
turned
my
thoughts
my
soul
and
hopes
toward
anne
and
st
philomene
the
first
was
the
object
of
my
confidences
since
the
first
time
i
had
seen
the
numberless
crutches
and
other
ex
votos
which
covered
the
church
of
la
bonne
anne
du
nord
and
the
second
was
the
saint
la
it
was
said
that
her
body
had
lately
been
miraculously
discovered
and
the
world
was
filled
with
the
noise
of
the
miracles
wrought
through
her
intercession
her
medals
were
on
every
breast
her
pictures
in
every
house
and
her
name
on
all
lips
with
entire
confidence
in
the
will
and
power
of
these
two
saints
to
obtain
any
favor
for
me
i
invoked
them
to
pray
god
to
grant
me
a
few
years
more
of
life
and
with
the
utmost
honesty
of
purpose
i
promised
to
add
to
my
penances
and
to
live
a
more
holy
life
by
consecrating
myself
with
more
zeal
than
ever
to
the
service
of
the
poor
and
the
sick
i
added
to
my
former
prayer
the
solemn
promise
to
have
a
painting
of
the
two
saints
put
in
anne
s
church
to
proclaim
to
the
end
of
the
world
their
great
power
in
heaven
if
they
would
obtain
my
cure
and
restore
my
health
strange
to
say
the
last
words
of
my
prayer
were
scarcely
uttered
when
i
saw
above
my
head
anne
and
philomene
sitting
in
the
midst
of
a
great
light
on
a
beautiful
golden
cloud
anne
was
very
old
and
grave
but
philomene
was
very
young
and
beautiful
both
were
looking
at
me
with
great
kindness
however
the
kindness
of
anne
was
mixed
with
such
an
air
of
awe
and
gravity
that
i
did
not
like
her
looks
while
philomene
had
such
an
expression
of
superhuman
love
and
kindness
that
i
felt
myself
drawn
to
her
by
a
magnetic
power
when
she
said
distinctly
you
will
be
cured
and
the
vision
disappeared
but
i
was
cured
perfectly
cured
at
the
disappearance
of
the
two
saints
i
felt
as
though
an
electric
shock
went
through
my
whole
frame
the
pains
were
gone
the
tongue
was
untied
the
nerves
were
restored
to
their
natural
and
easy
power
my
eyes
were
opened
the
cold
and
icy
waves
which
were
fast
going
from
the
extremities
to
the
regions
of
the
heart
seemed
to
be
changed
into
a
most
pleasant
warm
bath
restoring
life
and
strength
to
every
part
of
my
body
i
raised
my
head
stretched
out
my
hands
which
i
had
not
moved
for
three
days
and
looking
around
i
saw
the
four
priests
i
said
to
them
i
am
cured
please
give
me
something
to
eat
i
am
astonished
beyond
measure
two
of
them
threw
their
arms
around
my
shoulders
to
help
me
sit
a
moment
and
change
my
pillow
when
two
others
ran
to
the
table
which
the
kind
nuns
of
quebec
had
covered
with
delicacies
in
case
i
might
want
them
their
joy
was
mixed
with
fear
for
they
all
confessed
to
me
afterwards
that
they
at
once
thought
that
all
this
was
nothing
but
the
last
brilliant
flash
of
light
which
the
flickering
lamp
gives
before
dying
away
but
they
soon
changed
their
minds
when
they
saw
that
i
was
eating
ravenously
and
that
i
was
speaking
to
them
and
thanking
god
with
a
cheerful
though
very
feeble
voice
what
does
this
mean
they
all
said
the
doctors
told
us
last
evening
that
you
were
dead
and
we
have
passed
the
night
not
only
weeping
over
your
death
but
praying
for
your
soul
to
rescue
it
from
the
flames
of
purgatory
and
now
you
look
so
hungry
so
cheerful
and
so
i
answered
it
means
that
i
was
not
dead
but
very
near
dying
and
when
i
felt
that
i
was
to
die
i
prayed
to
anne
and
philomene
to
come
to
my
help
and
cure
me
and
they
have
come
i
have
seen
them
both
there
above
my
head
ah
if
i
were
a
painter
what
a
beautiful
picture
i
could
make
of
that
dear
old
anne
and
the
still
dearer
philomene
for
it
is
philomene
who
has
spoken
to
me
as
the
messenger
of
the
mercies
of
god
i
have
promised
to
have
their
portraits
painted
and
put
into
the
church
of
the
good
anne
du
while
i
was
speaking
thus
the
priests
filled
with
admiration
and
awe
were
mute
they
could
not
speak
except
with
tears
of
gratitude
they
honestly
believed
with
me
that
my
cure
was
miraculous
and
consented
with
pleasure
to
sing
that
beautiful
hymn
of
gratitude
the
te
the
next
morning
the
news
of
my
miraculous
cure
spread
through
the
whole
city
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
for
besides
a
good
number
of
the
first
citizens
of
quebec
who
were
related
to
me
by
blood
i
had
not
less
than
penitents
who
loved
and
respected
me
as
their
spiritual
father
to
give
an
idea
of
the
kind
interest
of
the
numberless
friends
whom
god
had
given
me
when
in
quebec
i
will
relate
a
single
fact
the
citizens
who
were
near
our
parsonage
having
been
told
by
a
physician
that
the
inflammation
of
my
brain
was
so
terrible
that
the
least
noise
even
the
passing
of
carriages
or
the
walking
of
horses
on
the
streets
was
causing
me
real
torture
they
immediately
covered
all
the
surrounding
streets
with
several
inches
of
straw
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
more
noise
the
physicians
having
heard
of
my
sudden
cure
hastened
to
come
and
see
what
it
meant
at
first
they
could
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
the
night
before
they
had
given
me
up
for
dead
after
thirteen
days
suffering
with
the
most
horrible
and
incurable
of
diseases
and
there
i
was
the
very
next
morning
perfectly
cured
no
more
pain
not
the
least
remnant
of
fever
all
the
faculties
of
my
body
and
mind
perfectly
restored
they
minutely
asked
me
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
that
strange
unexpected
cure
and
i
told
them
simply
but
plainly
how
at
the
very
moment
i
expected
to
die
i
had
fervently
prayed
to
anne
and
philomene
and
how
they
had
come
spoken
to
me
and
cured
me
two
of
my
physicians
were
roman
catholics
and
three
protestants
they
at
first
looked
at
each
other
without
saying
a
word
it
was
evident
that
they
were
not
all
partakers
of
my
strong
faith
in
the
power
of
the
two
saints
while
the
roman
catholic
doctors
parent
and
rousseau
seemed
to
believe
in
my
miraculous
cure
the
protestants
energetically
protested
against
that
view
in
the
name
of
science
and
common
sense
douglas
put
me
the
following
questions
and
received
the
following
answers
he
said
dear
father
chiniquy
you
know
you
have
not
a
more
devoted
friend
in
quebec
than
i
and
you
know
me
too
well
to
suspect
that
i
want
to
hurt
your
religious
feelings
when
i
tell
you
that
there
is
not
the
least
appearance
of
a
miracle
in
your
so
happy
and
sudden
cure
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
answer
my
questions
you
will
see
that
you
are
mistaken
in
attributing
to
a
miracle
a
thing
which
is
most
common
and
natural
though
you
are
perfectly
cured
you
are
very
weak
please
answer
only
yes
or
no
to
my
questions
in
order
not
to
exhaust
yourself
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
us
if
this
is
the
first
vision
you
have
had
during
the
period
of
that
terrible
fever
ans
i
have
had
many
other
visions
but
i
took
them
as
being
the
effect
of
the
fever
doctor
please
make
your
answers
shorter
or
else
i
will
not
ask
you
another
question
for
it
would
hurt
you
tell
us
simply
if
you
have
not
seen
in
those
visions
at
times
very
frightful
and
terrible
and
at
others
very
beautiful
things
ans
yes
sir
doctor
have
not
those
visions
stamped
themselves
on
your
mind
with
such
a
power
and
vividness
that
you
never
forget
them
and
that
you
deem
them
more
realities
than
mere
visions
of
a
sickly
brain
ans
yes
sir
doctor
did
you
not
feel
sometimes
much
worse
and
sometimes
much
better
after
those
visions
according
to
their
nature
ans
yes
sir
doctor
when
at
ease
in
your
mind
during
that
disease
were
you
not
used
to
pray
to
the
saints
particularly
to
anne
and
philomene
ans
yes
sir
doctor
when
you
considered
that
death
was
very
near
and
it
was
indeed
when
you
had
heard
my
imprudent
sentence
that
you
had
only
a
few
minutes
to
live
were
you
not
taken
suddenly
by
such
a
fear
of
death
as
you
never
felt
before
ans
yes
sir
doctor
did
you
not
then
make
a
great
effort
to
repel
death
from
you
ans
yes
sir
doctor
do
you
know
that
you
are
a
man
of
an
exceedingly
strong
will
and
that
very
few
men
can
resist
you
when
you
want
to
do
something
do
you
not
know
that
your
will
is
such
an
exceptional
power
that
mountains
of
difficulties
have
disappeared
before
you
here
in
quebec
have
you
not
seen
even
me
with
many
others
yielding
to
your
will
almost
in
spite
of
ourselves
to
do
what
you
wanted
with
a
smile
i
answered
yes
doctor
do
you
not
know
that
the
will
or
if
you
like
it
better
the
soul
has
a
real
mysterious
and
sometimes
an
irresistible
power
over
the
body
to
silence
its
passions
calm
its
sufferings
and
really
heal
its
diseases
particularly
when
they
are
of
a
nervous
nature
as
in
all
cases
of
fever
ans
yes
sir
i
know
that
doctor
do
you
not
remember
seeing
many
times
people
suffering
dreadfully
from
toothache
coming
to
us
to
have
their
teeth
extracted
who
were
suddenly
cured
at
the
sight
of
the
knives
and
other
surgical
instruments
we
put
upon
the
table
for
use
i
answered
with
a
laugh
yes
sir
i
have
seen
that
very
often
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
doctor
do
you
think
that
there
was
a
supernatural
power
then
in
the
surgical
implements
and
that
those
sudden
cures
of
toothache
were
miraculous
ans
no
sir
doctor
have
you
not
read
the
volume
of
the
medical
directory
i
lent
you
on
typhoid
fever
where
several
cures
exactly
like
yours
are
reported
ans
yes
sir
then
addressing
the
physicians
douglas
said
to
them
we
must
not
exhaust
our
dear
father
chiniquy
we
are
too
happy
to
see
him
full
of
life
again
but
from
his
answers
you
understand
that
there
is
no
miracle
here
his
happy
and
sudden
cure
is
a
very
natural
and
common
thing
the
vision
was
what
we
call
the
of
the
disease
when
the
mind
is
powerfully
bent
on
some
very
exciting
object
when
that
mysterious
thing
of
which
we
know
so
little
as
yet
called
the
will
the
spirit
the
soul
fights
as
a
giant
against
death
in
which
battle
pains
diseases
and
even
death
are
put
to
flight
and
conquered
my
dear
father
chiniquy
from
your
own
lips
we
have
it
you
have
fought
last
night
the
fever
and
approaching
death
as
a
giant
no
wonder
that
you
won
the
victory
and
i
confess
it
is
a
great
victory
i
know
it
is
not
the
first
victory
you
have
gained
and
i
am
sure
it
will
not
be
the
last
it
is
surely
god
who
has
given
you
that
irresistible
will
in
that
sense
only
does
your
cure
come
from
him
continue
to
fight
and
conquer
as
you
have
done
last
night
and
you
will
live
a
long
life
death
will
long
remember
its
defeat
of
last
night
and
will
not
dare
approach
you
any
more
except
when
you
will
be
so
old
that
you
will
ask
it
to
come
as
a
friend
and
put
an
end
to
the
miseries
of
this
present
life
and
with
friendly
smiles
all
the
doctors
pressed
my
hand
and
left
me
just
as
the
bishop
and
the
curate
of
quebec
mons
baillargeon
my
confessor
were
entering
the
room
an
old
proverb
says
there
is
nothing
so
difficult
as
to
persuade
a
man
who
does
not
want
to
be
though
the
reasoning
and
kind
words
of
the
doctor
ought
to
have
been
gladly
listened
to
by
me
they
had
only
bothered
me
it
was
infinitely
more
pleasant
and
it
seemed
then
more
agreeable
to
god
and
more
according
to
my
faith
in
the
power
of
the
saints
in
heaven
to
believe
that
i
had
been
miraculously
cured
of
course
the
bishop
with
his
coadjutor
and
my
lord
turgeon
as
well
as
my
confessor
with
the
numberless
priests
and
roman
catholics
who
visited
me
during
my
convalescence
confirmed
me
in
my
views
the
skillful
painter
plamondon
recently
from
rome
was
called
and
painted
at
the
price
of
the
tableau
i
had
promised
to
put
in
the
church
of
anne
du
nord
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
remarkable
paintings
of
that
artist
who
had
passed
several
years
in
the
capitol
of
fine
arts
in
italy
where
he
had
gained
a
very
good
reputation
for
his
ability
three
months
after
my
recovery
i
was
at
the
parsonage
of
the
curate
of
anne
the
rev
ranvoize
a
relative
of
mine
he
was
about
years
of
age
very
rich
and
had
a
magnificent
library
when
young
he
had
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
best
preachers
in
canada
never
had
i
been
so
saddened
and
scandalized
as
i
was
by
him
on
this
occasion
it
was
evening
when
i
arrived
with
my
tableau
as
soon
as
we
were
left
alone
the
old
curate
said
is
it
possible
my
dear
young
cousin
that
you
will
make
such
a
fool
of
yourself
that
miraculous
cure
is
nothing
but
suprema
as
the
learned
of
all
ages
have
called
it
your
vision
was
a
dream
of
your
sickly
brain
as
it
generally
occurs
at
the
moment
of
the
supreme
crisis
of
the
fever
it
is
what
is
called
the
of
the
disease
when
a
desperate
effort
of
nature
kills
or
cures
the
patient
as
for
the
vision
of
that
beautiful
girl
whom
you
call
philomene
who
has
done
you
so
much
good
she
is
not
the
first
girl
surely
who
has
come
to
you
in
your
dreams
and
done
you
good
at
these
words
he
laughed
so
heartily
that
i
feared
he
would
split
his
sides
twice
he
repeated
this
unbecoming
joke
i
was
at
first
so
shocked
at
this
unexpected
rebuke
which
i
considered
as
bordering
on
blasphemy
that
i
came
very
near
taking
my
hat
without
answering
a
word
to
go
and
spend
the
night
at
his
brother
s
but
after
a
moment
s
reflection
i
said
to
him
how
can
you
speak
with
such
levity
on
so
solemn
a
thing
do
you
not
believe
in
the
power
of
the
saints
who
being
more
holy
and
pure
than
we
are
see
god
face
to
face
speak
to
him
and
obtain
favors
which
he
would
refuse
to
us
rebels
are
you
not
the
daily
witness
of
the
miraculous
cures
wrought
in
your
own
church
under
your
own
eyes
why
those
thousands
of
crutches
which
literally
cover
the
walls
of
your
church
my
strong
faith
and
the
earnestness
of
my
appeal
to
the
daily
miracles
of
which
he
was
the
witness
and
above
all
the
mention
of
the
numberless
crutches
suspended
all
over
the
walls
of
his
church
brought
again
from
him
such
a
homeric
laugh
that
i
was
disconcerted
and
saddened
beyond
measure
i
remained
absolutely
mute
i
wished
i
had
never
come
into
such
company
when
he
had
laughed
at
me
to
his
heart
s
content
he
said
my
dear
cousin
you
are
the
first
one
to
whom
i
speak
in
this
way
i
do
it
because
first
i
consider
you
a
man
of
intelligence
and
hope
you
will
understand
me
secondly
because
you
are
my
cousin
were
you
one
of
those
idiotic
priests
real
blockheads
who
form
the
clergy
of
or
were
you
a
stranger
to
me
i
would
let
you
go
your
way
and
believe
in
those
ridiculous
degrading
superstitions
of
our
poor
ignorant
and
blind
people
but
i
know
you
from
your
infancy
and
i
have
known
your
father
who
was
one
of
my
dearest
friends
the
blood
which
flows
in
your
veins
passes
thousands
of
times
every
day
through
my
heart
you
are
very
young
and
i
very
old
it
is
a
duty
of
honor
and
conscience
in
me
to
reveal
to
you
a
thing
which
i
have
thought
better
to
keep
till
now
a
secret
between
god
and
myself
i
have
been
here
more
than
thirty
years
and
though
our
country
is
constantly
filled
with
the
noise
of
the
great
and
small
miracles
wrought
in
my
church
every
day
i
am
ready
to
swear
before
god
and
to
prove
to
any
man
of
common
sense
that
not
a
single
miracle
has
been
wrought
in
my
church
since
i
have
come
here
every
one
of
the
facts
given
to
the
canadian
people
as
miraculous
cures
are
sheer
impositions
deceptions
the
work
of
either
fools
or
the
work
of
skillful
impostors
and
hypocrites
whether
priests
or
laymen
believe
me
my
dear
cousin
i
have
studied
carefully
the
history
of
all
those
crutches
out
of
a
hundred
have
been
left
by
poor
lazy
beggars
who
at
first
thought
with
good
reason
that
by
walking
from
door
to
door
with
one
or
two
crutches
they
would
create
more
sympathy
and
bring
more
into
their
purses
for
how
many
will
indignantly
turn
out
of
doors
a
lazy
strong
and
healthful
beggar
who
will
feel
great
compassion
and
give
largely
to
a
man
who
is
crippled
unable
to
work
and
forced
to
drag
himself
painfully
on
crutches
those
crutches
are
then
passports
from
door
to
door
they
are
the
very
keys
to
open
both
the
hearts
and
purses
but
the
day
comes
when
that
beggar
has
bought
a
pretty
good
farm
with
his
stolen
alms
or
when
he
is
really
tired
disgusted
with
his
crutches
and
wants
to
get
rid
of
them
how
can
he
do
that
without
compromising
himself
by
a
miracle
then
he
will
sometimes
travel
again
hundreds
of
miles
from
door
to
door
begging
as
usual
but
this
time
he
asks
the
prayers
of
the
whole
family
saying
i
am
going
to
the
good
anne
du
nord
to
ask
her
to
cure
my
leg
or
legs
i
hope
she
will
cure
me
as
she
has
cured
so
many
others
i
have
great
confidence
in
her
power
each
one
gives
twice
nay
ten
times
as
much
as
before
to
the
poor
cripple
making
him
promise
that
if
he
is
cured
he
will
come
back
and
show
himself
that
they
may
bless
the
good
anne
with
him
when
he
arrives
here
he
gives
me
sometimes
one
sometimes
five
dollars
to
say
mass
for
him
i
take
the
money
for
i
would
be
a
fool
to
refuse
it
when
i
know
that
his
purse
has
been
so
well
filled
during
the
celebration
of
the
mass
when
he
receives
the
communion
i
hear
generally
a
great
noise
cries
of
joy
a
miracle
a
miracle
the
crutches
are
thrown
on
the
floor
and
the
cripple
walks
as
well
as
you
or
i
and
the
last
act
of
that
religious
comedy
is
the
most
lucrative
one
for
he
fulfills
his
promise
of
stopping
at
every
house
he
had
ever
been
seen
with
his
crutches
he
narrates
how
he
was
miraculously
cured
how
his
feet
and
legs
became
suddenly
all
right
tears
of
joy
and
admiration
flow
from
every
eye
the
last
cent
of
that
family
is
generally
given
to
the
impostor
who
soon
grows
rich
at
the
expense
of
his
dupes
this
is
the
plain
but
true
story
of
out
of
every
hundred
of
the
cures
wrought
in
my
church
the
hundredth
is
upon
people
as
honest
but
pardon
me
the
expression
as
blind
and
superstitious
as
you
are
they
are
really
cured
for
they
were
really
sick
but
their
cures
are
the
natural
effects
of
the
great
efforts
of
the
will
it
is
the
result
of
a
happy
combination
of
natural
causes
which
work
together
on
the
frame
and
kill
the
pain
expel
the
disease
and
restore
to
health
just
as
i
was
cured
of
a
most
horrible
toothache
some
years
ago
in
the
paroxysm
i
went
to
the
dentist
and
requested
him
to
extract
the
affected
tooth
hardly
had
his
knife
and
other
surgical
instruments
come
before
my
eyes
than
the
pain
disappeared
i
quietly
took
my
hat
and
left
bidding
a
hearty
to
the
dentist
who
laughed
at
me
every
time
we
met
to
his
heart
s
content
one
of
the
weakest
points
of
our
religion
is
in
the
ridiculous
i
venture
to
say
diabolical
miracles
performed
and
believed
every
day
among
us
with
the
relics
and
bones
of
the
saints
but
don
t
you
know
that
for
the
most
part
these
relics
are
nothing
but
chickens
or
sheeps
bones
and
what
could
not
say
were
i
to
tell
you
of
what
i
know
of
the
daily
miraculous
impostures
of
the
scapulars
holy
water
chaplets
and
medals
of
every
kind
were
i
a
pope
i
would
throw
all
these
mummeries
which
come
from
paganism
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
would
present
to
the
eyes
of
the
sinners
nothing
but
christ
and
him
crucified
as
the
object
of
their
faith
invocation
and
hope
for
this
life
and
the
next
just
as
the
apostle
paul
peter
and
james
do
in
their
i
can
not
repeat
here
all
that
i
heard
that
night
from
that
old
relative
against
the
miracles
relics
scapulars
purgatory
false
saints
and
ridiculous
practices
of
the
church
of
rome
it
would
take
too
long
for
he
spoke
three
hours
as
a
real
protestant
sometimes
what
he
said
to
me
seemed
according
to
common
sense
but
as
it
was
against
the
practices
of
my
church
and
against
my
personal
practices
i
was
exceedingly
scandalized
and
pained
and
not
at
all
convinced
i
pitied
him
for
having
lost
his
former
faith
and
piety
i
told
him
at
the
end
without
ceremony
i
heard
long
ago
that
the
bishops
did
not
like
you
but
i
knew
not
why
however
if
they
could
hear
what
you
think
and
say
here
about
the
miracles
of
anne
they
would
surely
interdict
will
you
betray
me
he
added
and
will
you
report
our
conversation
to
the
bishop
no
my
cousin
i
replied
i
would
prefer
to
be
burned
to
ashes
i
will
not
sell
your
kind
hospitality
for
the
traitor
s
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
we
parted
to
go
to
our
sleeping
rooms
but
that
night
was
again
a
sleepless
one
to
me
was
it
not
too
sad
and
strange
for
me
to
see
that
that
old
and
learned
priest
was
secretly
a
protestant
the
next
morning
the
crowds
began
to
arrive
not
by
hundreds
but
by
thousands
from
the
surrounding
parishes
the
channel
between
l
isle
d
orleans
and
anne
was
literally
covered
with
boats
of
every
size
laden
with
men
and
women
who
wanted
to
hear
from
my
own
lips
the
history
of
my
miraculous
cure
and
see
with
their
own
eyes
the
picture
of
the
two
saints
who
had
appeared
to
me
at
more
than
people
were
crowded
inside
and
outside
the
walls
of
the
church
no
words
can
give
an
idea
of
my
emotion
and
of
the
emotion
of
the
multitude
when
after
telling
them
in
a
simple
and
plain
way
what
i
then
considered
a
miraculous
fact
i
disclosed
to
their
eyes
and
presented
it
to
their
admiration
and
worship
there
were
tears
rolling
on
every
cheek
and
cries
of
admiration
and
joy
from
every
lip
the
picture
represented
me
dying
in
my
bed
of
sufferings
and
the
two
saints
seen
at
a
distance
above
me
and
stretching
their
hands
as
if
to
say
you
will
be
it
was
hung
on
the
walls
in
a
conspicuous
place
where
thousands
and
thousands
have
come
to
worship
it
from
that
day
to
the
year
when
the
curate
was
ordered
by
the
bishop
to
burn
it
for
it
had
pleased
our
merciful
god
that
very
year
to
take
away
the
scales
which
were
on
my
eyes
and
show
me
his
saving
light
and
i
had
published
all
over
canada
my
terrible
though
unintentional
error
in
believing
in
that
false
miracle
i
however
was
honest
in
my
belief
in
a
miraculous
cure
and
the
apparition
of
the
two
saints
had
left
such
a
deep
impression
on
my
mind
that
i
confess
it
to
my
shame
the
first
week
after
my
conversion
i
very
often
said
to
myself
how
is
it
that
i
now
believe
that
the
church
of
rome
is
false
when
such
a
miracle
has
been
wrought
on
me
as
one
of
her
priests
but
our
god
whose
mercies
are
infinite
knowing
my
honesty
when
a
slave
of
popery
was
determined
to
give
me
the
full
understanding
of
my
errors
in
this
way
about
a
month
after
my
conversion
in
i
had
to
visit
a
dying
irish
convert
from
romanism
who
had
caught
in
chicago
the
same
fever
which
so
nearly
killed
me
at
the
marine
hospital
of
quebec
i
again
caught
the
disease
and
during
twelve
days
passed
through
the
same
tortures
and
suffered
the
same
agonies
as
in
but
this
time
i
was
really
happy
to
die
there
was
no
fear
for
me
to
see
the
good
works
as
a
grain
of
sand
in
my
favor
and
the
mountains
of
my
iniquities
in
the
balance
of
god
against
me
i
just
had
given
up
my
pharisaical
holiness
of
old
it
was
no
more
in
my
good
works
my
alms
my
penances
my
personal
efforts
i
was
trusting
to
be
saved
it
was
in
jesus
alone
my
good
works
were
no
more
put
by
me
in
the
balance
of
the
justice
of
god
to
pay
my
debts
and
to
appeal
for
mercy
it
was
the
blood
of
jesus
the
lamb
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
for
me
which
was
in
the
balance
it
was
the
tears
of
jesus
the
nails
the
crown
of
thorns
the
heavy
cross
the
cruel
death
of
jesus
only
which
was
there
to
pay
my
debts
and
to
cry
for
mercy
i
had
no
fear
then
for
i
knew
that
i
was
saved
by
jesus
and
that
that
salvation
was
a
perfect
act
of
his
love
his
mercy
and
his
power
i
was
glad
to
die
but
when
the
doctor
had
left
me
the
thirteenth
day
of
my
sufferings
saying
the
very
same
words
of
the
doctors
of
quebec
he
has
only
a
few
minutes
to
live
if
he
be
not
already
dead
the
kind
friends
who
were
around
my
bed
filled
the
room
with
their
cries
although
for
three
or
four
days
i
had
not
moved
a
finger
said
a
single
word
or
given
any
sign
of
life
i
was
perfectly
conscious
i
had
heard
the
words
of
the
doctor
and
i
was
glad
to
exchange
the
miseries
of
this
short
life
for
that
eternity
of
glory
which
my
saviour
had
bought
for
me
i
only
regretted
to
die
before
bringing
more
of
my
dear
countrymen
out
of
the
idolatrous
religion
of
rome
and
from
the
lips
of
my
soul
i
said
dear
jesus
i
am
glad
to
go
with
thee
just
now
but
if
it
be
thy
will
to
let
me
live
a
few
years
more
that
i
may
spread
the
light
of
the
gospel
among
my
countrymen
grant
me
to
live
a
few
years
more
and
i
will
bless
thee
eternally
with
my
converted
countrymen
for
thy
this
prayer
had
scarcely
reached
the
mercy
seat
when
i
saw
a
dozen
bishops
marching
toward
me
sword
in
hand
to
kill
me
as
the
first
sword
raised
to
strike
was
coming
down
to
split
my
head
i
made
a
desperate
effort
wrenched
it
from
the
hand
of
my
murderer
and
struck
such
a
blow
on
his
neck
that
the
head
rolled
down
to
the
floor
the
second
third
fourth
and
so
on
to
the
last
rushed
to
kill
me
but
i
struck
such
terrible
blows
on
the
necks
of
every
one
of
them
that
twelve
heads
were
rolling
on
the
floor
and
swimming
in
a
pool
of
blood
in
my
excitement
i
cried
to
my
friends
around
me
do
you
not
see
the
heads
rolling
and
the
blood
flowing
on
the
floor
and
suddenly
i
felt
a
kind
of
electric
shock
from
head
to
foot
i
was
cured
perfectly
cured
i
asked
my
friends
for
something
to
eat
i
had
not
taken
any
food
for
twelve
days
and
with
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
to
god
they
complied
with
my
request
this
last
cure
was
not
only
the
perfect
cure
of
the
body
but
it
was
a
perfect
cure
of
the
soul
i
understood
then
clearly
that
the
first
was
not
more
miraculous
than
the
second
i
had
a
perfect
understanding
of
the
diabolical
forgeries
and
miracles
of
rome
i
was
not
cured
or
saved
by
the
saints
the
bishops
or
the
popes
but
by
my
god
through
his
son
jesus
chapter
xxxiii
my
nomination
as
curate
of
and
ruin
of
that
place
through
opposition
to
my
nomination
to
establish
a
temperance
write
to
father
mathew
for
advice
the
of
september
was
a
day
of
desolation
to
me
on
that
day
i
received
the
letter
of
my
bishop
appointing
me
curate
of
beauport
many
times
i
had
said
to
the
other
priests
when
talking
about
our
choice
of
the
different
parishes
that
i
would
never
consent
to
be
curate
of
beauport
that
parish
which
is
a
kind
of
a
suburb
of
quebec
was
too
justly
considered
the
very
nest
of
the
drunkards
of
canada
with
a
soil
of
unsurpassed
fertility
inexhaustible
lime
quarries
gardens
covered
with
most
precious
vegetables
and
fruits
forests
near
at
hand
to
furnish
wood
to
the
city
of
quebec
at
their
doors
the
people
of
beauport
were
nevertheless
classed
among
the
poorest
most
ragged
and
wretched
people
of
canada
for
almost
every
cent
they
were
getting
at
the
market
went
into
the
hands
of
the
hundreds
of
times
i
had
seen
the
streets
which
led
from
roch
to
the
upper
town
of
quebec
almost
impassable
when
the
drunkards
of
beauport
were
leaving
the
market
to
go
home
how
many
times
i
heard
them
fill
the
air
with
their
cries
and
blasphemies
and
saw
the
streets
reddened
with
their
blood
when
fighting
with
one
another
like
mad
dogs
the
rev
mr
begin
who
was
their
cure
since
had
accepted
the
moral
principles
of
the
great
roman
catholic
theologia
liguori
which
says
that
a
man
is
not
guilty
of
the
sin
of
drunkenness
so
long
as
he
can
distinguish
between
a
small
pin
and
a
load
of
of
course
the
people
would
not
find
themselves
guilty
of
sin
so
long
as
their
eyes
could
make
that
distinction
after
weeping
to
my
heart
s
content
at
the
reading
of
the
letter
from
my
bishop
which
had
come
to
me
as
a
thunderbolt
my
first
thought
was
that
my
misfortune
though
very
great
was
not
irretrievable
i
knew
that
there
were
many
priests
who
were
as
anxious
to
become
curates
of
beauport
as
i
was
opposed
to
it
my
hope
was
that
the
bishop
would
be
touched
by
my
tears
if
not
convinced
by
my
arguments
and
that
he
would
not
persist
in
putting
on
my
shoulders
a
burden
which
they
could
not
carry
i
immediately
went
to
the
palace
and
did
all
in
my
power
to
persuade
his
lordship
to
select
another
priest
for
beaufort
he
listened
to
my
arguments
with
a
good
deal
of
patience
and
kindness
and
answered
my
dear
chiniquy
you
forget
too
often
that
implicit
and
perfect
obedience
to
his
superiors
is
the
virtue
of
a
good
priest
you
have
given
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
disappointment
by
refusing
to
relieve
the
good
bishop
provencher
of
his
too
heavy
burden
it
was
at
my
suggestion
you
know
very
well
that
he
had
selected
you
to
be
his
along
the
coasts
of
the
pacific
by
consenting
to
become
the
first
bishop
of
oregon
your
obstinate
resistance
to
your
superiors
in
that
circumstance
and
in
several
other
cases
is
one
of
your
weak
points
if
you
continue
to
follow
your
own
mind
rather
than
obey
those
whom
god
has
chosen
to
guide
you
i
really
fear
for
your
future
i
have
already
too
often
yielded
to
your
rebellious
character
through
respect
to
myself
and
for
your
own
good
i
must
force
you
to
obey
me
you
have
spoken
of
the
drunkenness
of
the
people
of
beauport
as
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
should
not
put
you
at
the
head
of
that
parish
but
this
is
just
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
have
chosen
you
you
are
the
only
priest
i
know
in
my
diocese
able
to
struggle
against
the
and
detestable
evil
with
a
hope
of
success
scriptum
scriptum
your
name
is
entered
in
our
official
registers
as
the
curate
of
beauport
it
will
remain
there
till
i
find
better
reasons
than
those
you
have
given
me
to
change
my
mind
after
all
you
can
not
complain
beauport
is
not
only
the
most
beautiful
parsonage
in
canada
but
it
is
one
of
the
most
splendid
spots
in
the
world
in
your
beautiful
parsonage
at
the
door
of
the
old
capital
of
canada
you
will
have
the
privileges
of
the
city
and
the
enjoyments
of
some
of
the
most
splendid
scenery
of
this
continent
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
me
i
do
not
know
what
i
can
do
to
please
though
far
from
being
reconciled
to
my
new
position
i
saw
there
was
no
help
i
had
to
obey
as
my
predecessor
mr
begin
was
to
sell
all
his
house
furniture
before
taking
charge
of
his
far
distant
parish
la
riviere
ouelle
he
kindly
invited
me
to
go
and
buy
on
long
credit
what
i
wished
for
my
own
use
which
i
did
the
whole
parish
was
on
the
spot
long
before
me
partly
to
show
their
friendly
sympathy
for
their
late
pastor
and
partly
to
see
their
new
curate
i
was
not
long
in
the
crowd
without
seeing
that
my
small
stature
and
my
leanness
were
making
a
very
bad
impression
on
the
people
who
were
accustomed
to
pay
their
respects
to
a
comparatively
tall
man
whose
large
and
square
shoulders
were
putting
me
in
the
shade
many
jovial
remarks
though
made
in
tones
came
to
my
ears
to
tell
me
that
i
was
cutting
a
poor
figure
by
the
side
of
my
jolly
predecessor
he
is
hardly
bigger
than
my
said
one
not
far
from
me
i
think
i
could
put
him
in
my
vest
has
he
not
the
appearance
of
a
salted
sardine
whispered
a
woman
to
her
neighbor
with
a
hearty
laugh
had
i
been
a
little
wiser
i
could
have
redeemed
myself
by
some
amiable
or
funny
words
which
would
have
sounded
pleasantly
in
the
ears
of
my
new
parishioners
but
unfortunately
for
me
that
wisdom
is
not
among
the
gifts
i
received
from
nature
after
a
couple
of
hours
of
auction
a
large
cloth
was
suddenly
removed
from
a
long
table
and
presented
to
our
sight
an
incredible
number
of
wine
and
of
empty
decanters
and
bottles
of
all
sizes
and
quality
this
brought
a
burst
of
laughter
and
clapping
of
hands
from
almost
every
one
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
me
and
i
heard
from
hundreds
of
lips
this
is
for
you
without
weighing
my
words
i
instantly
answered
i
do
not
come
to
beauport
to
buy
wine
glasses
and
bottles
but
to
break
these
words
fell
upon
their
ears
like
a
spark
of
fire
on
a
train
of
powder
of
the
multitude
without
being
very
drunk
had
emptied
from
four
to
ten
glasses
of
beer
or
rum
which
rev
mr
begin
himself
was
offering
them
in
a
corner
of
the
parsonage
a
real
deluge
of
insults
and
cursings
overwhelmed
me
and
i
soon
saw
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
leave
the
place
without
noise
and
by
the
shortest
way
i
immediately
went
to
the
bishop
s
palace
to
try
again
to
persuade
his
lordship
to
put
another
curate
at
the
head
of
such
a
people
you
see
my
lord
i
said
that
by
my
indiscreet
and
rash
answer
i
have
forever
lost
the
respect
and
confidence
of
that
people
they
already
hate
me
their
brutal
cursings
have
fallen
upon
me
like
balls
of
fire
i
prefer
to
be
carried
to
my
grave
next
sabbath
than
have
to
address
such
a
degraded
people
i
feel
that
i
have
neither
the
moral
nor
the
physical
power
to
do
any
good
i
differ
from
you
replied
the
bishop
evidently
the
people
wanted
to
try
your
mettle
by
inviting
you
to
buy
those
glasses
and
you
would
have
lost
yourself
by
yielding
to
their
desire
now
they
have
seen
that
you
are
brave
and
fearless
it
is
just
what
the
people
of
beauport
want
i
have
known
them
for
a
long
time
it
is
true
that
they
are
drunkards
but
apart
from
that
vice
there
is
not
a
nobler
people
under
heaven
they
have
literally
no
education
but
they
possess
marvellous
common
sense
and
have
many
noble
and
redeeming
qualities
which
you
will
soon
find
out
you
took
them
by
surprise
when
you
boldly
said
you
wanted
to
break
their
glasses
and
decanters
believe
me
they
will
bless
you
if
by
the
grace
of
god
you
fulfill
your
prophecy
though
it
will
be
a
miracle
if
you
succeed
in
making
the
people
of
beauport
sober
but
you
must
not
despair
trust
in
god
fight
as
a
good
soldier
and
jesus
christ
will
win
the
those
kind
words
of
my
bishop
did
me
good
though
i
would
have
preferred
being
sent
to
the
back
woods
of
canada
than
to
the
great
parish
of
beauport
i
felt
that
the
only
thing
that
i
had
to
do
was
to
trust
in
god
for
success
and
to
fight
as
if
i
were
to
gain
the
day
it
came
to
my
mind
that
i
had
committed
a
great
sin
by
obstinately
refusing
to
become
bishop
of
oregon
and
my
god
as
a
punishment
had
given
me
the
very
parish
for
which
i
felt
an
almost
insurmountable
repugnance
the
next
sunday
was
a
splendid
day
and
the
church
of
beauport
was
filled
to
its
utmost
capacity
by
the
people
eager
to
see
and
hear
for
the
first
time
their
new
pastor
i
had
spent
the
last
three
days
in
prayers
and
fastings
god
knows
that
never
a
priest
nor
any
minister
of
the
gospel
ascended
the
pulpit
with
more
exalted
views
of
his
sublime
functions
than
i
did
that
day
and
never
a
messenger
of
the
gospel
had
been
more
terrified
than
i
was
when
in
that
pulpit
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
demerits
inability
and
incompetency
in
the
face
of
the
tremendous
responsibilities
of
his
position
my
first
sermon
was
on
the
text
woe
unto
me
if
i
preach
not
the
gospel
cor
with
a
soul
and
heart
filled
with
the
profoundest
emotions
a
voice
many
times
suffocated
by
uncontrollable
sobs
i
expounded
to
them
some
of
the
awful
responsibilities
of
a
pastor
the
effect
of
that
sermon
was
felt
to
the
last
day
of
my
priestly
ministry
in
beauport
after
the
sermon
i
told
them
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
as
it
is
the
first
i
hope
you
will
not
rebuke
me
i
have
just
now
given
you
some
of
the
duties
of
your
poor
young
curate
toward
you
i
want
you
to
come
again
this
afternoon
at
two
o
clock
that
i
may
give
you
some
of
your
duties
toward
your
at
the
appointed
hour
the
church
was
still
more
crowded
than
in
the
morning
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
merciful
god
blessed
still
more
that
second
address
than
the
first
the
text
was
when
he
the
shepherd
putteth
forth
his
own
sheep
he
goeth
before
them
and
the
sheep
follow
him
for
they
know
his
john
those
two
sermons
on
the
sabbath
were
a
startling
innovation
in
the
roman
catholic
church
of
canada
which
brought
upon
me
at
once
many
bitter
remarks
from
the
bishop
and
surrounding
curates
their
unanimous
verdict
was
that
i
wanted
to
become
a
little
reformer
they
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
in
my
pride
i
wanted
to
show
to
the
people
that
i
was
the
most
zealous
priest
of
the
this
was
not
only
whispered
from
ear
to
ear
among
the
clergy
but
several
times
it
was
thrown
into
my
face
in
the
most
insulting
manner
however
my
god
knew
that
my
only
motives
were
first
to
keep
my
people
away
from
the
taverns
by
having
them
before
their
altars
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
sabbath
day
second
to
impress
more
on
their
minds
the
great
saving
and
regenerating
truths
i
preached
by
presenting
them
twice
on
the
same
day
under
different
aspects
i
found
such
benefits
from
those
two
sermons
that
i
continued
the
practice
during
the
four
years
i
remained
in
beauport
though
i
had
to
suffer
and
hear
in
silence
many
humiliating
and
cutting
remarks
from
many
i
had
not
been
more
than
three
months
at
the
head
of
that
parish
when
i
determined
to
organize
a
temperance
society
on
the
same
principles
as
father
mathew
in
ireland
i
opened
my
mind
at
first
on
that
subject
to
the
bishop
with
the
hope
that
he
would
throw
the
influence
of
his
position
in
favor
of
the
new
association
but
to
my
great
dismay
and
surprise
not
only
did
he
turn
my
project
into
ridicule
but
absolutely
forbade
me
to
think
any
more
of
such
an
innovation
those
temperance
societies
are
a
protestant
scheme
he
said
preach
against
drunkenness
but
let
the
respectable
people
who
are
not
drunkards
alone
paul
advised
his
disciple
timothy
to
drink
wine
do
not
try
to
be
more
zealous
than
they
were
in
those
apostolic
i
left
the
bishop
much
disappointed
but
did
not
give
up
my
plan
it
seemed
to
me
if
i
could
gain
the
neighboring
priests
to
join
with
me
in
my
crusade
i
wanted
to
preach
against
the
usage
of
intoxicating
drinks
we
might
bring
about
a
glorious
reform
in
canada
as
father
mathew
was
doing
in
ireland
but
the
priests
without
a
single
exception
laughed
at
me
turned
my
plans
into
ridicule
and
requested
me
in
the
name
of
common
sense
never
to
speak
any
more
to
them
of
giving
up
their
social
glass
of
wine
i
shall
never
be
able
to
give
any
idea
of
my
sadness
when
i
saw
that
i
was
to
be
opposed
by
my
bishop
and
the
whole
clergy
in
the
reform
which
i
considered
then
more
and
more
every
day
the
only
plank
of
salvation
not
only
of
my
dear
people
of
beauport
but
of
all
canada
god
alone
knows
the
tears
i
shed
the
long
sleepless
nights
i
have
passed
in
studying
praying
meditating
on
that
great
and
holy
work
of
beauport
i
had
recourse
to
all
the
saints
of
heaven
for
more
strength
and
light
for
i
was
determined
at
any
cost
to
try
and
form
a
temperance
society
but
every
time
i
wanted
to
begin
i
was
frightened
by
the
idea
not
only
of
the
wrath
of
the
whole
clergy
which
would
hunt
me
down
but
still
more
of
the
ridicule
of
the
whole
country
which
would
overwhelm
me
in
case
of
a
failure
in
these
perplexities
i
thought
i
would
do
well
to
write
to
father
mathew
and
ask
him
his
advice
and
the
help
of
his
prayers
that
noble
apostle
of
temperance
of
ireland
answered
me
in
an
eloquent
letter
and
pressed
me
to
begin
the
work
in
canada
as
he
had
done
in
ireland
relying
on
god
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
opposition
of
man
the
wise
and
christian
words
of
that
great
and
worthy
irish
priest
came
to
me
as
the
voice
of
god
and
i
determined
to
begin
the
work
at
once
though
the
whole
world
should
be
against
me
i
felt
that
if
god
was
in
my
favor
i
would
succeed
in
reforming
my
parish
and
my
country
in
spite
of
all
the
priests
and
bishops
of
the
world
and
i
was
right
before
putting
the
plow
into
the
ground
i
had
not
only
prayed
to
god
and
all
his
saints
almost
day
and
night
during
many
months
but
i
had
studied
all
the
best
books
written
in
england
france
and
the
united
states
on
the
evil
wrought
by
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
i
had
taken
a
pretty
good
course
of
anatomy
in
the
marine
hospital
under
the
learned
douglas
i
was
then
well
posted
on
the
great
subject
i
was
to
bring
before
my
country
i
knew
the
enemy
i
was
to
attack
and
the
weapons
which
would
give
him
the
death
blow
were
in
my
hands
i
only
wanted
my
god
to
strengthen
my
hands
and
direct
my
blows
i
prayed
to
him
and
in
his
great
mercy
he
heard
me
chapter
xxxiv
the
hand
of
god
in
the
establishment
of
the
temperance
society
in
beauport
and
vicinity
my
thoughts
are
not
your
thoughts
saith
the
lord
and
we
may
add
his
works
are
not
like
the
works
of
man
this
great
truth
has
never
been
better
exemplified
than
in
the
marvellous
rapidity
with
which
the
great
temperance
reformation
grew
in
canada
in
spite
of
the
most
formidable
obstacles
to
praise
any
man
for
such
work
seems
to
me
a
kind
of
blasphemy
when
it
is
so
visibly
the
work
of
the
lord
i
had
hardly
finished
reading
the
letter
of
ireland
s
apostle
of
temperance
when
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
said
thou
knowest
o
my
god
that
i
am
nothing
but
a
sinner
there
is
no
light
no
strength
in
thy
poor
unprofitable
servant
therefore
come
down
into
my
heart
and
soul
to
direct
me
in
that
temperance
reform
which
thou
hast
put
into
my
mind
to
establish
without
thee
i
can
do
nothing
but
with
thee
i
can
do
all
this
was
on
saturday
night
march
the
next
morning
was
the
first
sabbath
of
lent
i
said
to
the
people
after
the
sermon
i
have
told
you
many
times
that
i
sincerely
believe
it
is
my
mission
from
god
to
put
an
end
to
the
unspeakable
miseries
and
crimes
engendered
every
day
here
and
in
our
whole
country
by
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
alcohol
is
the
greatest
enemy
of
your
souls
and
your
bodies
it
is
the
most
implacable
enemy
of
your
husbands
your
wives
and
your
children
it
is
the
most
formidable
enemy
of
our
dear
country
and
our
holy
religion
i
must
destroy
that
enemy
but
i
can
not
fight
alone
i
must
form
an
army
and
raise
a
banner
in
your
midst
around
which
all
the
soldiers
of
the
gospel
will
rally
jesus
christ
himself
will
be
our
general
he
will
bless
and
sanctify
will
lead
us
to
victory
the
next
three
days
will
be
consecrated
by
you
and
by
me
in
preparing
to
raise
that
army
let
all
those
who
wish
to
fill
its
ranks
come
and
pass
these
three
days
with
me
in
prayer
and
meditation
at
the
feet
of
our
sacred
altars
let
even
those
who
do
not
want
to
be
soldiers
of
christ
or
to
fight
the
great
and
glorious
battles
which
are
to
be
fought
come
through
curiosity
to
see
a
most
marvellous
spectacle
i
invite
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
whom
alcohol
nails
anew
to
the
cross
every
day
i
invite
you
in
the
name
of
the
holy
virgin
mary
and
of
all
the
saints
and
angels
of
god
who
are
weeping
in
heaven
for
the
crimes
committed
every
day
by
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
i
invite
you
in
the
names
of
the
wives
whom
i
see
here
in
your
midst
weeping
because
they
have
drunkard
husbands
i
invite
you
to
come
in
the
names
of
the
fathers
whose
hearts
are
broken
by
drunkard
children
i
invite
you
to
come
in
the
name
of
so
many
children
who
are
starving
naked
and
made
desolate
by
their
drunkard
parents
i
invite
you
to
come
in
the
name
of
your
immortal
souls
which
are
to
be
eternally
damned
if
the
giant
destroyer
alcohol
be
not
driven
from
our
the
next
morning
at
eight
o
clock
my
church
was
crammed
by
the
people
my
first
address
was
at
eight
o
clock
the
second
at
the
third
at
and
the
fourth
at
five
the
intervals
between
the
addresses
were
filled
by
beautiful
hymns
selected
for
the
occasion
many
times
during
my
discourse
the
sobs
and
the
cries
of
the
people
were
such
that
i
had
to
stop
speaking
to
mix
my
sobs
and
my
tears
with
those
of
my
people
the
first
day
men
from
among
the
most
desperate
drunkards
enrolled
themselves
under
the
banner
of
temperance
the
second
day
i
gave
again
four
addresses
the
effects
of
which
were
still
more
blessed
in
their
result
two
hundred
of
my
dear
parishioners
were
enrolled
in
the
grand
army
which
was
to
fight
against
their
implacable
enemy
but
it
would
require
the
hand
of
an
angel
to
write
the
history
of
the
third
day
at
the
end
of
which
in
the
midst
of
tears
sobs
and
cries
of
joy
three
hundred
more
of
that
noble
people
swore
in
the
presence
of
their
god
never
to
touch
taste
nor
handle
the
cursed
drinks
with
which
satan
inundates
the
earth
with
desolation
and
fills
hell
with
eternal
cries
of
despair
during
these
three
days
more
than
of
my
people
had
publicly
taken
the
pledge
of
temperance
and
had
solemnly
said
in
the
presence
of
god
at
the
feet
of
their
altars
for
the
love
of
jesus
christ
and
by
the
grace
of
god
i
promise
that
i
will
never
take
any
intoxicating
drink
except
as
a
medicine
i
also
pledge
myself
to
do
all
in
my
power
by
my
words
and
example
to
persuade
others
to
make
the
same
the
majority
of
my
people
among
whom
we
counted
the
most
degraded
drunkards
were
changed
and
reformed
not
by
me
surely
but
by
the
visible
direct
work
of
the
great
and
merciful
god
who
alone
can
change
the
heart
of
man
as
a
great
number
of
people
from
the
surrounding
parishes
and
even
from
quebec
had
come
to
hear
me
the
third
day
through
curiosity
the
news
of
that
marvellous
work
spread
very
quickly
throughout
the
whole
country
the
press
both
french
and
english
were
unanimous
in
their
praises
and
felicitations
but
when
the
protestants
of
quebec
were
blessing
god
for
that
reform
the
french
canadians
at
the
example
of
their
priests
denounced
me
as
a
fool
and
heretic
the
second
day
of
our
revival
i
had
sent
messages
to
four
of
the
neighboring
curates
respectfully
requesting
them
to
come
and
see
what
the
lord
was
doing
and
help
me
to
bless
him
but
they
refused
they
answered
my
note
with
their
contemptuous
silence
one
only
the
rev
roy
curate
of
charlesbourg
deigned
to
write
me
a
few
words
which
i
copy
here
rev
chiniquy
curate
of
beauport
my
dear
confrere
forgive
me
if
i
can
not
forget
the
respect
i
owe
to
myself
enough
to
go
and
see
your
fooleries
truly
yours
pierre
roy
charlesbourg
march
the
indignation
of
the
bishop
knew
no
bounds
a
few
days
after
he
ordered
me
to
go
to
his
palace
and
give
an
account
of
what
he
called
my
strange
when
alone
with
me
he
said
is
it
possible
chiniquy
that
you
have
so
soon
forgotten
my
prohibition
not
to
establish
that
ridiculous
temperance
society
in
your
parish
had
you
compromised
yourself
alone
by
that
protestant
it
is
nothing
but
would
remain
silent
in
my
pity
for
you
but
you
have
compromised
our
holy
religion
by
introducing
a
society
whose
origin
is
clearly
heretical
last
evening
the
venerable
grand
vicar
demars
told
me
that
you
would
sooner
or
later
become
a
protestant
and
that
this
was
your
first
step
do
you
not
see
that
the
protestants
only
praise
you
do
you
not
blush
to
be
praised
only
by
heretics
without
suspecting
it
you
are
just
entering
a
road
which
leads
to
your
ruin
you
have
publicly
covered
yourself
with
such
ridicule
that
i
fear
your
usefulness
is
at
an
end
not
only
in
beauport
but
in
all
my
diocese
i
do
not
conceal
it
from
you
my
first
thought
when
an
told
me
yesterday
what
you
had
done
was
to
interdict
you
i
have
been
prevented
from
taking
that
step
only
by
the
hope
that
you
will
undo
what
you
have
done
i
hope
that
you
yourself
will
dissolve
that
association
and
promise
to
put
an
end
to
these
novelties
which
have
too
strong
a
smell
of
heresy
to
be
tolerated
by
your
i
answered
my
lord
your
lordship
has
not
forgotten
that
it
was
absolutely
against
my
own
will
that
i
was
appointed
curate
of
beauport
and
god
knows
that
you
have
only
to
say
a
word
and
without
a
murmur
i
will
give
you
my
resignation
that
you
may
put
a
better
priest
at
the
head
of
that
people
which
i
consider
and
which
is
really
the
noblest
and
the
most
sober
people
of
canada
but
i
will
put
a
condition
to
the
resignation
of
my
position
it
is
that
i
will
be
allowed
to
publish
before
the
world
that
the
rev
mr
begin
my
predecessor
has
never
been
troubled
by
his
bishop
for
having
allowed
his
people
during
years
to
swim
in
the
mire
of
drunkenness
and
that
i
have
been
disgraced
by
my
bishop
and
turned
out
from
that
same
parish
for
having
been
the
instrument
by
the
mercy
of
god
in
making
them
the
most
sober
people
of
the
poor
bishop
felt
at
once
that
he
could
not
stand
on
the
ground
he
had
taken
with
me
he
was
a
few
minutes
without
knowing
what
to
say
he
saw
also
that
his
threats
had
no
influence
over
me
and
that
i
was
not
ready
to
undo
what
i
had
done
after
a
painful
silence
of
a
minute
or
two
he
said
do
you
not
see
that
the
solemn
promises
you
have
extorted
from
those
poor
drunkards
are
rash
and
unwise
they
will
break
them
at
the
first
opportunity
their
future
state
of
degradation
after
such
an
excitement
will
be
worse
than
the
i
answered
i
would
partake
of
your
fears
if
that
change
were
my
work
but
as
it
is
the
lord
s
work
we
have
nothing
to
fear
the
works
of
men
are
weak
and
of
short
duration
but
the
works
of
god
are
solid
and
permanent
about
the
prophecy
of
the
venerable
demars
that
i
have
taken
my
first
step
towards
protestantism
by
turning
a
drunken
into
a
sober
people
i
have
only
to
say
that
if
that
prophecy
be
true
it
would
show
that
protestantism
is
more
apt
than
our
holy
religion
to
work
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
the
people
i
hope
that
your
lordship
is
not
ready
to
accept
that
conclusion
and
that
you
will
not
then
trouble
yourself
with
the
premises
the
venerable
grand
vicar
with
many
other
priests
would
do
better
to
come
and
see
what
the
lord
is
doing
in
beauport
than
to
slander
me
and
turn
false
prophets
against
its
curate
and
people
my
only
answer
to
the
remarks
of
your
lordship
that
the
protestants
alone
praise
me
when
the
roman
catholic
priests
and
people
condemn
me
proves
only
one
thing
viz
that
protestants
on
this
question
understand
the
word
of
god
and
have
more
respect
for
it
than
we
roman
catholics
it
would
prove
also
that
they
understand
the
interests
of
humanity
better
than
we
do
and
that
they
have
more
generosity
than
we
have
to
sacrifice
their
selfish
propensities
to
the
good
of
all
i
take
the
liberty
of
saying
to
your
lordship
that
in
this
as
in
many
other
things
it
is
high
time
that
we
should
open
our
eyes
to
our
false
position
instead
of
remaining
at
the
lowest
step
of
the
ladder
of
one
of
the
most
christian
virtues
temperance
we
must
raise
ourselves
to
the
top
where
protestants
are
reaping
so
many
precious
fruits
besides
would
your
lordship
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
why
i
am
denounced
and
abused
here
and
by
my
and
my
bishop
for
forming
a
temperance
society
in
my
parish
when
father
mathew
who
wrote
to
me
lately
to
encourage
and
direct
me
in
that
work
is
publicly
praised
by
his
bishops
and
blessed
by
the
pope
for
covering
ireland
with
temperance
societies
is
your
lordship
ready
to
prove
to
me
that
samson
was
a
heretic
in
the
camp
of
israel
when
he
fulfilled
the
promise
made
by
his
parents
that
he
would
never
drink
any
wine
or
beer
and
john
the
baptist
was
he
not
a
heretic
and
a
protestant
as
i
am
when
to
obey
the
voice
of
god
he
did
what
i
do
with
my
dear
people
of
beauport
at
that
very
moment
the
entered
to
tell
the
bishop
that
a
gentleman
wanted
to
see
him
immediately
on
pressing
business
and
the
bishop
abruptly
dismissed
me
to
my
great
comfort
and
my
impression
was
that
he
was
as
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
as
i
was
to
get
rid
of
him
with
the
exception
of
the
secretary
cazeault
all
the
priests
i
met
that
day
and
the
next
month
either
gave
me
the
cold
shoulder
or
overwhelmed
me
with
their
sarcasms
one
of
them
who
had
friends
in
beauport
was
bold
enough
to
try
to
go
through
the
whole
parish
to
turn
me
into
ridicule
by
saying
that
i
was
half
crazy
and
the
best
thing
the
people
could
do
was
to
drink
moderately
to
my
health
when
they
went
to
town
but
at
the
third
house
he
met
a
woman
who
after
listening
to
the
bad
advice
he
was
giving
to
her
husband
said
to
him
i
do
not
know
if
our
pastor
is
a
fool
in
making
people
sober
but
i
know
you
are
a
messenger
of
the
devil
when
you
advise
my
husband
to
drink
again
you
know
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
desperate
drunkards
of
beauport
you
personally
know
also
what
blows
i
have
received
from
him
when
he
was
drunk
how
poor
and
miserable
we
were
how
many
children
had
to
run
on
the
streets
half
naked
and
beg
in
order
not
to
starve
with
me
now
that
my
husband
has
taken
the
pledge
of
temperance
we
have
every
comfort
my
dear
children
are
well
fed
and
clothed
and
i
find
myself
as
in
a
little
paradise
if
you
do
not
go
out
of
this
immediately
i
will
turn
you
out
with
my
and
she
would
have
fulfilled
her
promise
had
not
the
priest
had
the
good
sense
to
disappear
at
the
the
next
four
months
after
the
foundation
of
the
society
in
beauport
my
position
when
with
the
other
priests
was
very
painful
and
humiliating
i
consequently
avoided
their
company
as
much
as
possible
and
as
for
my
bishop
i
took
the
resolution
never
to
go
and
see
him
except
he
should
order
me
into
his
presence
but
my
merciful
god
indemnified
me
by
the
unspeakable
joy
i
had
in
seeing
the
marvellous
change
wrought
by
him
among
my
dear
people
their
fidelity
in
keeping
the
pledge
was
really
wonderful
and
soon
became
the
object
of
the
admiration
of
the
whole
city
of
quebec
and
of
the
surrounding
country
the
change
was
so
sudden
so
complete
and
so
permanent
that
the
scoffing
bishops
and
priests
with
their
friends
had
at
last
to
blush
and
be
silent
the
public
aspect
of
the
parish
was
soon
changed
the
houses
were
repaired
the
debts
paid
the
children
well
clad
but
what
spoke
most
eloquently
about
the
marvellous
reform
was
that
the
seven
thriving
saloons
of
beauport
were
soon
closed
and
their
owners
forced
to
take
to
other
occupations
peace
happiness
abundance
and
industry
everywhere
took
the
place
of
the
riots
fighting
blasphemies
and
the
squalid
misery
which
prevailed
before
the
gratitude
and
respect
of
that
noble
people
for
their
young
curate
knew
no
bounds
as
my
love
and
admiration
for
them
can
not
be
told
by
human
words
however
though
the
great
majority
of
that
good
people
had
taken
the
pledge
and
kept
it
honorably
there
was
a
small
minority
composed
of
the
few
who
never
had
been
drunkards
who
had
not
yet
enrolled
themselves
under
our
blessed
banners
though
they
were
glad
of
the
reform
it
was
very
difficult
to
persuade
them
to
give
up
their
social
glass
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
show
them
in
a
tangible
way
what
i
had
so
often
proved
with
my
words
only
that
the
drinking
of
the
social
glass
of
wine
or
of
beer
is
an
act
of
folly
if
not
a
crime
i
asked
my
kind
and
learned
doctor
douglas
to
analyze
before
the
people
the
very
wine
and
beer
used
by
them
to
show
that
it
was
nothing
else
but
a
disgusting
and
deadly
poison
he
granted
my
favor
during
four
days
that
noble
philanthropist
extracted
the
alcohol
which
is
not
only
in
the
most
common
but
in
the
most
costly
and
renowned
wines
beer
brandy
and
whiskey
he
gave
that
alcohol
to
several
cats
and
dogs
which
died
in
a
few
minutes
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
people
these
learned
and
most
interesting
experiments
coupled
with
his
eloquent
and
scientific
remarks
made
a
most
profound
impression
it
was
the
of
the
holy
edifice
which
our
merciful
god
built
with
his
own
hands
in
beauport
the
few
recalcitrants
joined
with
the
rest
of
their
dear
friends
to
show
to
our
dear
canada
that
the
temperance
societies
are
nothing
else
than
drops
of
living
water
which
comes
from
the
fountains
of
eternal
life
to
reform
and
save
the
world

neighboring

bishop
of
publicly
defends
me
against
the
bishop
of
quebec
and
forever
breaks
the
opposition
of
the
clergy
the
people
of
beauport
had
scarcely
been
a
year
enrolled
under
the
banners
of
temperance
when
the
seven
thriving
taverns
of
that
parish
were
deserted
and
their
owners
forced
to
try
some
more
honorable
trade
for
a
living
this
fact
published
by
the
whole
press
of
quebec
more
than
anything
forced
the
opponents
especially
among
the
clergy
to
silence
without
absolutely
reconciling
them
to
my
views
however
it
was
becoming
every
day
more
and
more
evident
to
all
that
the
good
done
in
beauport
was
incalculable
both
in
a
material
and
moral
point
of
view
several
of
the
best
thinking
people
of
the
surrounding
parishes
began
to
say
to
one
another
why
should
we
not
try
to
bring
into
our
midst
this
temperance
reformation
which
is
doing
so
much
good
in
beauport
the
wives
of
drunkards
would
say
why
does
not
our
curate
do
here
what
the
curate
of
beauport
has
done
there
on
a
certain
day
one
of
those
unfortunate
women
who
had
received
with
a
good
education
a
rich
inheritance
which
her
husband
had
spent
in
dissipation
came
to
tell
me
that
she
had
gone
to
her
curate
to
ask
him
to
establish
a
temperance
society
in
his
parish
as
we
had
done
in
beauport
but
he
had
told
her
to
mind
her
own
she
had
then
respectfully
requested
him
to
invite
me
to
come
and
help
to
do
for
his
parishioners
what
i
had
done
for
mine
but
she
had
been
sternly
rebuked
at
the
mention
of
my
name
the
poor
woman
was
weeping
when
she
said
is
it
possible
that
our
priests
are
so
indifferent
to
our
sufferings
and
that
they
will
let
the
demon
of
drunkenness
torture
us
as
long
as
we
live
when
god
gives
us
such
an
easy
and
honorable
way
to
destroy
his
power
for
ever
my
heart
was
touched
by
the
tears
of
that
lady
and
i
said
to
her
i
know
a
way
to
put
an
end
to
the
opposition
of
your
curate
and
force
him
to
bring
among
you
the
reformation
you
so
much
desire
but
it
is
a
very
delicate
matter
for
me
to
mention
to
you
i
must
rely
upon
your
sacred
promise
of
secrecy
before
opening
my
mind
to
you
on
that
i
take
my
god
to
witness
she
answered
that
i
will
never
reveal
your
well
madame
if
i
can
rely
upon
your
discretion
and
secrecy
i
will
tell
you
an
infallible
way
to
force
your
priest
to
do
what
has
been
done
oh
for
god
s
sake
she
said
tell
me
what
to
i
replied
the
first
time
you
go
to
confession
say
to
your
priest
that
you
have
a
new
sin
to
confess
which
is
very
difficult
to
reveal
to
him
he
will
press
you
more
to
confess
it
you
will
then
say
father
i
confess
i
have
lost
confidence
in
being
asked
why
you
will
tell
him
father
you
know
the
bad
treatment
i
have
received
from
my
drunken
husband
as
well
as
hundreds
of
other
wives
in
your
parish
from
theirs
you
know
the
tears
we
have
shed
on
the
ruin
of
our
children
who
are
destroyed
by
the
bad
example
of
their
drunken
fathers
you
know
the
daily
crimes
and
unspeakable
abominations
caused
by
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
you
could
dry
our
tears
and
make
us
happy
wives
and
mothers
you
could
convert
our
husbands
and
save
our
children
by
establishing
the
society
of
temperance
here
as
it
is
in
beauport
and
you
refuse
to
do
it
how
then
can
i
believe
you
are
a
good
priest
and
that
there
is
any
charity
and
compassion
in
you
for
us
listen
with
a
respectful
silence
to
what
he
will
tell
you
accept
his
penance
and
when
he
asks
you
if
you
regret
that
sin
answer
him
that
you
can
not
regret
it
till
he
has
taken
the
providential
means
which
god
offers
him
to
convert
the
drunkards
get
as
many
other
women
whom
you
know
are
suffering
as
you
do
as
you
can
to
go
and
confess
to
him
the
same
thing
and
you
will
see
that
his
obstinancy
will
melt
as
the
snow
before
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
she
was
a
very
intelligent
lady
she
saw
at
once
that
she
had
in
hand
an
irresistible
power
to
force
her
priest
out
of
his
shameful
and
criminal
indifference
to
the
welfare
of
his
people
a
fortnight
later
she
came
to
tell
me
that
she
had
done
what
i
had
advised
her
and
that
more
than
fifty
other
respectable
women
had
confessed
to
their
curate
that
they
had
lost
confidence
in
him
on
account
of
his
lack
of
zeal
and
charity
for
his
people
my
conjectures
were
correct
the
poor
priest
was
beside
himself
when
forced
every
day
to
hear
from
the
very
lips
of
his
most
respectable
female
parishioners
that
they
were
losing
confidence
in
him
he
feared
lest
he
should
lose
his
fine
parish
near
quebec
and
be
sent
to
some
of
the
backwoods
of
canada
three
weeks
later
he
was
knocking
at
my
door
where
he
had
not
been
since
the
establishment
of
the
temperance
society
he
was
very
pale
and
looked
anxious
i
could
see
in
his
countenance
that
i
owed
the
honor
of
this
visit
to
his
fair
penitents
however
i
was
happy
to
see
him
he
was
considered
a
good
priest
and
had
been
one
of
my
best
friends
before
the
formation
of
the
temperance
society
i
invited
him
to
dine
with
me
and
made
him
feel
at
home
as
much
as
possible
for
i
knew
by
his
embarrassed
manner
that
he
had
a
very
difficult
proposition
to
make
i
was
not
mistaken
he
at
last
said
mr
chiniquy
we
had
at
first
great
prejudices
against
your
temperance
society
but
we
see
its
blessed
fruits
in
the
great
transformation
of
beauport
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
preach
a
retreat
of
temperance
during
three
days
to
my
people
as
you
have
done
here
i
answered
yes
sir
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
it
is
on
condition
that
you
will
yourself
be
an
example
of
the
sacrifice
and
the
first
to
take
the
solemn
pledge
of
temperance
in
the
presence
of
your
certainly
he
answered
for
the
pastor
must
be
an
example
to
his
three
weeks
later
his
parish
had
nobly
followed
the
example
of
beauport
and
the
good
curate
had
no
words
to
express
his
joy
without
losing
a
day
he
went
to
the
two
other
curates
of
what
is
called
la
cote
de
beaupre
persuaded
them
to
do
what
he
had
done
and
six
weeks
after
all
the
saloons
from
beauport
to
joachim
were
closed
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
persuade
any
one
in
that
whole
region
to
drink
a
glass
of
any
intoxicating
drink
little
by
little
the
country
priests
were
thus
giving
up
their
prejudices
and
were
bravely
rallying
around
our
glorious
banners
of
temperance
but
my
bishop
though
less
severe
was
still
very
cold
toward
me
at
last
the
good
providence
of
god
forced
him
through
a
great
humiliation
to
count
our
society
among
the
greatest
spiritual
and
temporal
blessings
of
the
age
at
the
end
of
august
the
public
press
informed
us
that
the
count
de
forbin
janson
bishop
de
nancy
in
france
was
just
leaving
new
york
for
montreal
that
bishop
who
was
the
cousin
and
minister
to
charles
the
tenth
had
been
sent
into
exile
by
the
french
people
after
the
king
had
lost
his
crown
in
the
revolution
of
father
mathew
had
told
me
in
one
of
his
letters
that
this
bishop
had
visited
him
and
blessed
his
work
in
ireland
and
had
also
persuaded
the
pope
to
send
him
his
apostolical
benediction
i
saw
at
once
the
importance
of
gaining
the
approbation
of
this
celebrated
man
before
he
had
been
prejudiced
by
the
bishop
against
our
temperance
societies
i
asked
and
obtained
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
days
and
went
to
montreal
which
i
reached
just
an
hour
after
the
french
bishop
i
went
immediately
to
pay
my
homage
to
him
told
him
all
about
our
temperance
work
asking
him
in
the
name
of
god
to
throw
bravely
the
weight
of
his
great
name
and
position
in
the
scale
in
favor
of
our
temperance
societies
he
promised
he
would
adding
i
am
perfectly
persuaded
that
drunkenness
is
not
only
the
great
and
common
sin
of
the
people
but
still
more
of
the
priests
in
america
as
well
as
in
ireland
the
social
habit
of
drinking
the
detestable
and
poisonous
wines
brandies
and
beer
used
on
this
continent
and
in
the
northern
parts
of
europe
where
the
vine
can
not
grow
is
so
general
and
strong
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
save
the
people
from
becoming
drunkards
except
through
an
association
in
which
the
elite
of
society
will
work
together
to
change
the
old
and
pernicious
habits
of
common
life
i
have
seen
father
mathew
who
is
doing
an
incalculable
good
in
ireland
and
be
sure
of
it
i
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
strengthen
your
hands
in
that
great
and
good
work
but
do
not
say
to
anybody
that
you
have
seen
some
days
later
the
bishop
of
nancy
was
in
quebec
the
guest
of
the
seminary
and
a
grand
dinner
was
given
in
his
honor
to
which
more
than
one
hundred
priests
were
invited
with
the
archbishop
of
quebec
his
coadjutor
turgeon
and
the
bishop
of
montreal
bourget
as
one
of
the
youngest
curates
i
had
taken
the
last
seat
which
was
just
opposite
the
four
bishops
from
whom
i
was
separated
only
by
the
breadth
of
the
table
when
the
rich
and
rare
viands
had
been
well
disposed
of
and
the
most
delicate
fruits
had
replaced
them
bottles
of
the
choicest
wines
were
brought
on
the
table
in
incredible
numbers
then
the
superior
of
the
college
the
rev
demars
knocked
on
the
table
to
command
silence
and
rising
on
his
feet
he
said
at
the
top
of
his
voice
please
my
lord
bishops
and
all
of
you
reverend
gentlemen
let
us
drink
to
the
health
of
my
lord
count
de
forbin
janson
primate
of
lorraine
and
bishop
of
the
bottles
passing
around
were
briskly
emptied
into
the
large
glasses
put
before
every
one
of
the
guests
but
when
the
wine
was
handed
to
me
i
passed
it
to
my
neighbor
without
taking
a
drop
and
filled
my
glass
with
water
my
hope
was
that
nobody
had
paid
any
attention
to
what
i
had
done
but
i
was
mistaken
the
eyes
of
my
bishop
my
lord
signaie
were
upon
me
with
a
stern
voice
he
said
mr
chiniquy
what
are
you
doing
there
put
wine
in
your
glass
to
drink
with
us
the
health
of
mgr
de
these
unexpected
words
fell
upon
me
as
a
thunderbolt
and
paralyzed
me
with
terror
i
felt
as
at
the
approach
of
the
most
terrible
tempest
i
had
ever
experienced
my
blood
ran
cold
in
my
veins
i
could
not
utter
a
word
for
what
could
i
say
there
without
compromising
myself
forever
to
openly
resist
my
bishop
in
the
presence
of
such
an
august
assembly
seemed
impossible
but
to
obey
him
was
also
impossible
for
i
had
promised
my
god
and
my
country
never
to
drink
any
wine
i
thought
at
first
that
i
could
disarm
my
superior
by
my
modesty
and
my
humble
silence
however
i
felt
that
all
eyes
were
upon
me
a
real
chill
of
terror
and
unspeakable
anxiety
was
running
through
my
whole
frame
my
heart
began
to
beat
so
violently
that
i
could
not
breathe
i
wished
then
i
had
followed
my
first
impression
which
was
not
to
come
to
that
dinner
i
think
i
would
have
suffocated
had
not
a
few
tears
rolled
down
from
my
eyes
and
helped
the
circulation
of
my
blood
the
rev
lafrance
who
was
by
me
nudged
me
and
said
do
you
not
hear
the
order
of
my
lord
signaie
why
do
you
not
answer
by
doing
what
you
are
requested
to
do
i
still
remained
mute
just
as
if
nobody
had
spoken
to
me
my
eyes
were
cast
down
i
wished
then
i
were
dead
the
silence
of
death
reigning
around
the
tables
told
me
that
every
one
was
waiting
for
my
answer
but
my
lips
were
sealed
after
a
minute
of
that
silence
which
seemed
as
long
as
a
whole
year
the
bishop
with
a
loud
and
angry
voice
which
filled
the
large
room
repeated
why
do
you
not
put
wine
in
your
glass
and
drink
to
the
health
of
my
lord
forbin
janson
as
the
rest
of
us
are
doing
i
felt
i
could
not
be
silent
any
longer
my
lord
i
said
with
a
subdued
and
trembling
voice
i
have
put
in
my
glass
what
i
want
to
drink
i
have
promised
my
god
and
my
country
that
i
would
never
drink
any
more
the
bishop
forgetting
the
respect
he
owed
to
himself
and
to
those
around
him
answered
me
in
the
most
insulting
manner
you
are
nothing
but
a
fanatic
and
you
want
to
reform
these
words
struck
me
as
the
shock
of
a
galvanic
battery
and
transformed
me
into
a
new
man
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
added
ten
feet
to
my
stature
and
a
thousand
pounds
to
my
weight
i
forgot
that
i
was
the
subject
of
that
bishop
and
remembered
that
i
was
a
man
in
the
presence
of
another
man
i
raised
my
head
and
opened
my
eyes
as
quick
as
lightning
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
addressing
the
grand
vicar
demars
superior
of
the
seminary
i
said
with
calmness
sir
was
it
that
i
might
be
insulted
at
your
table
that
you
have
invited
me
here
is
it
not
your
duty
to
defend
my
honor
when
i
am
here
your
guest
but
as
you
seem
to
forget
what
you
owe
to
your
guests
i
will
take
my
own
defense
against
my
unjust
then
turning
towards
the
bishop
de
nancy
i
said
my
lord
de
nancy
i
appeal
to
your
lordship
from
the
unjust
sentence
of
my
own
bishop
in
the
name
of
god
and
of
his
son
jesus
christ
i
request
you
to
tell
us
here
if
a
priest
can
not
for
his
saviour
s
sake
and
for
the
good
of
his
as
well
as
for
his
own
give
up
forever
the
use
of
wine
and
other
intoxicating
drinks
without
being
abused
slandered
and
insulted
as
i
am
here
in
your
presence
it
was
evident
that
my
words
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
whole
company
a
solemn
silence
followed
for
a
few
seconds
which
was
interrupted
only
by
my
bishop
who
said
to
the
bishop
de
nancy
yes
yes
my
lord
give
us
your
no
words
can
give
an
idea
of
the
excitement
of
every
one
in
that
multitude
of
priests
who
accustomed
from
their
infancy
abjectly
to
submit
to
their
bishop
were
for
the
first
time
in
the
presence
of
such
a
conflict
between
a
powerless
humble
unprotected
young
curate
and
his
proud
and
haughty
archbishop
the
bishop
of
nancy
at
first
refused
to
grant
my
request
he
felt
the
difficulty
of
his
position
but
after
bishop
signaie
had
united
his
voice
to
mine
to
press
him
to
give
his
verdict
he
rose
and
said
my
lord
archbishop
of
quebec
and
you
chiniquy
please
withdraw
your
request
do
not
press
me
to
give
my
views
on
such
a
new
but
important
subject
it
is
only
a
few
days
since
i
came
in
your
midst
it
will
not
do
that
i
should
so
soon
become
your
judge
the
responsibility
of
a
judgment
in
such
a
momentous
matter
is
too
great
i
can
not
accept
but
when
the
same
pressing
request
was
repeated
by
of
that
vast
assembly
of
priests
and
that
the
archbishop
pressed
him
more
and
more
to
pronounce
his
sentence
he
raised
his
eyes
and
hands
to
heaven
and
made
a
silent
but
ardent
prayer
to
god
his
countenance
took
an
air
of
dignity
i
might
say
majesty
which
gave
him
more
the
appearance
of
an
old
prophet
than
of
a
man
of
our
day
then
casting
his
eyes
upon
his
audience
he
remained
a
considerable
time
meditating
all
eyes
were
upon
him
anxiously
waiting
for
the
sentence
there
was
an
air
of
grandeur
in
him
at
that
moment
which
seemed
to
tell
us
that
the
purest
blood
of
the
great
kings
of
france
was
flowing
in
his
veins
at
last
he
opened
his
lips
but
it
was
again
pressingly
to
request
me
to
settle
the
difficulty
with
the
archbishop
among
ourselves
and
to
discharge
him
of
that
responsibility
but
we
both
refused
again
to
grant
him
his
request
and
pressed
him
to
give
his
judgment
all
this
time
i
was
standing
having
publicly
said
that
i
would
never
sit
again
at
that
table
unless
that
insult
was
wiped
away
then
he
said
with
unspeakable
dignity
my
lord
of
quebec
here
before
us
is
our
young
priest
chiniquy
who
once
on
his
knees
in
the
presence
of
god
and
his
angels
for
the
love
of
jesus
christ
the
good
of
his
own
soul
and
the
good
of
his
country
has
promised
never
to
drink
we
are
the
witnesses
that
he
is
faithful
to
his
promise
though
he
has
been
pressed
to
break
it
by
your
lordship
and
because
he
keeps
his
pledge
with
such
heroism
your
lordship
has
called
him
a
fanatic
now
i
am
requested
by
every
one
here
to
pronounce
my
verdict
on
that
painful
occurrence
here
it
is
chiniquy
drinks
no
wine
but
if
i
look
through
the
past
ages
when
god
himself
was
ruling
his
own
people
through
his
prophets
i
see
samson
who
by
the
special
order
of
god
never
drank
wine
or
any
other
intoxicating
drink
if
from
the
old
testament
i
pass
to
the
new
i
see
john
the
baptist
the
precursor
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
who
to
obey
the
command
of
god
never
drank
any
wine
when
i
look
at
chiniquy
and
see
samson
at
his
right
hand
to
protect
him
and
john
the
baptist
at
his
left
to
bless
him
i
find
his
position
so
strong
and
impregnable
that
i
would
not
dare
attack
or
condemn
him
these
words
were
pronounced
in
the
most
eloquent
and
dignified
manner
and
were
listened
to
with
a
most
respectful
and
breathless
attention
bishop
de
nancy
keeping
his
gravity
sat
down
emptied
his
wine
glass
into
a
tumbler
filled
it
with
water
and
drank
to
my
health
the
poor
archbishop
was
so
completely
confounded
and
humiliated
that
every
one
felt
for
him
the
few
minutes
spent
at
the
table
after
this
extraordinary
act
of
justice
seemed
oppressive
to
every
one
scarcely
any
one
dared
to
look
at
his
neighbor
or
speak
except
in
a
low
and
subdued
tone
as
when
a
great
calamity
has
just
occurred
nobody
thought
of
drinking
his
wine
and
the
health
of
the
bishop
de
nancy
was
left
undrunk
but
a
good
number
of
priests
filled
their
glasses
with
water
and
giving
me
a
silent
sign
of
approbation
drank
to
my
health
the
society
of
temperance
had
been
dragged
by
her
enemies
to
the
to
be
destroyed
but
she
bravely
fought
and
gained
the
victory
now
she
was
called
to
begin
her
triumphant
march
through
our
dear
canada
chapter
xxxvi
the
god
of
rome
eaten
by
a
rat
has
god
given
us
ears
to
hear
eyes
to
see
and
intelligence
to
understand
the
pope
says
no
but
the
son
of
god
says
yes
one
of
the
most
severe
rebukes
of
our
saviour
to
his
disciples
was
for
their
not
paying
sufficient
attention
to
what
their
eyes
had
seen
their
ears
heard
and
their
intelligence
perceived
perceive
ye
not
yet
neither
understand
have
ye
your
heart
yet
hardened
having
eyes
see
ye
not
having
ears
hear
ye
not
and
do
not
ye
remember
mark
viii
this
solemn
appeal
of
our
saviour
to
our
common
sense
is
the
most
complete
demolition
of
the
whole
fabric
of
rome
the
day
that
a
man
ceases
to
believe
that
god
would
give
us
our
senses
and
our
intelligence
to
ruin
and
deceive
us
but
that
they
were
given
to
guide
us
he
is
lost
to
the
church
of
rome
the
pope
knows
it
hence
the
innumerable
encyclicals
laws
and
regulations
by
which
the
roman
catholics
are
warned
not
to
trust
the
testimony
of
their
ears
eyes
or
intelligence
shut
your
eyes
says
the
pope
to
his
priests
and
people
i
will
keep
mine
opened
and
i
will
see
for
you
shut
your
ears
for
it
is
most
dangerous
for
you
to
hear
what
is
said
in
the
world
i
will
keep
my
ears
opened
and
will
tell
you
what
you
must
know
remember
that
to
trust
your
own
intelligence
in
the
research
of
truth
and
the
knowledge
of
the
word
of
god
is
sure
perdition
if
you
want
to
know
anything
come
to
me
i
am
the
only
sure
infallible
fountain
of
truth
saith
the
pope
and
this
stupendous
imposture
is
accepted
by
the
people
and
the
priests
of
rome
with
a
mysterious
facility
and
retained
with
a
most
desolating
tenacity
it
is
to
them
what
the
iron
ring
is
to
the
nose
of
the
ox
when
a
rope
is
once
tied
to
it
the
poor
animal
loses
its
its
natural
strength
and
energies
will
avail
it
nothing
it
must
go
left
or
right
at
the
will
of
the
one
who
holds
the
end
of
the
rope
reader
please
have
no
contempt
for
the
unfortunate
priests
and
people
of
rome
but
pity
them
when
you
see
them
walking
in
the
ways
into
which
intelligent
beings
ought
not
to
take
a
step
they
can
not
help
it
the
ring
of
the
ox
is
at
their
nose
and
the
pope
holds
the
end
of
the
rope
had
it
not
been
for
that
ring
i
would
not
have
been
long
at
the
feet
of
the
wafer
god
of
the
pope
let
me
tell
you
of
one
of
the
shining
rays
of
truth
which
were
evidently
sent
by
our
merciful
god
with
a
mighty
power
to
open
my
eyes
but
i
could
not
follow
it
the
iron
ring
was
at
my
nose
and
the
pope
was
holding
the
end
of
the
rope
this
was
after
i
had
been
put
at
the
head
of
the
magnificent
parish
of
beauport
in
the
spring
of
there
was
living
at
la
jeune
lorette
an
old
retired
priest
who
was
blind
he
was
born
in
france
where
he
had
been
condemned
to
death
under
the
reign
of
terror
escaped
from
the
guillotine
he
had
fled
to
canada
where
the
bishop
of
quebec
had
put
him
in
the
elevated
post
of
chaplain
of
the
ursuline
nunnery
he
had
a
fine
voice
was
a
good
musician
and
had
some
pretensions
to
the
title
of
poet
having
composed
a
good
number
of
church
hymns
he
had
been
called
pere
cantique
but
his
real
name
was
pere
his
faith
and
piety
were
of
the
most
exalted
character
among
the
roman
catholics
though
these
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
one
of
the
most
amiable
and
jovial
men
i
ever
saw
but
his
blue
eyes
sweet
as
the
eyes
of
the
dove
his
fine
yellow
hair
falling
on
his
shoulders
as
a
golden
fleece
his
white
rosy
cheeks
and
his
constantly
smiling
lips
had
been
too
much
for
the
tender
hearts
of
the
good
nuns
it
was
not
a
secret
that
pere
cantique
when
young
had
made
several
interesting
conquests
in
the
monastery
there
was
no
wonder
at
that
indeed
how
could
that
young
and
inexperienced
butterfly
escape
damaging
his
golden
wings
at
the
numberless
burning
lamps
of
the
fair
virgins
but
the
mantle
of
charity
had
been
put
on
the
wounds
which
the
old
warrior
had
received
on
that
formidable
battlefield
from
which
even
the
davids
samsons
solomons
and
many
others
had
escaped
only
after
being
mortally
wounded
to
help
the
poor
blind
priest
the
curates
around
quebec
used
to
keep
him
by
turn
in
their
parsonages
and
give
him
the
care
and
marks
of
respect
due
to
his
old
age
after
the
rev
roy
curate
of
charlesbourg
had
kept
him
five
or
six
weeks
i
had
taken
him
to
my
parsonage
it
was
in
the
month
of
month
entirely
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
to
whom
father
daule
was
a
most
devoted
priest
his
zeal
was
really
inexhaustible
when
trying
to
prove
to
us
how
mary
was
the
surest
foundation
of
the
hope
and
salvation
of
sinners
how
she
was
constantly
appeasing
the
just
wrath
of
her
son
jesus
who
were
it
not
for
his
love
and
respect
to
her
would
have
long
since
crushed
us
down
the
councils
of
rome
have
forbidden
their
blind
priests
to
say
their
mass
but
on
account
of
high
piety
he
had
got
from
the
pope
the
privilege
of
celebrating
the
short
mass
of
the
virgin
which
he
knew
perfectly
by
heart
one
morning
when
the
old
priest
was
at
the
altar
saying
his
mass
and
i
was
in
the
vestry
hearing
the
confessions
of
the
people
the
young
servant
boy
came
to
me
in
haste
and
said
father
daule
calls
you
please
come
fearing
something
wrong
had
happened
to
my
old
friend
i
lost
no
time
and
ran
to
him
i
found
him
nervously
tapping
the
altar
with
his
two
hands
as
in
an
anxious
search
for
some
very
precious
thing
when
very
near
to
him
i
said
what
do
you
want
he
answered
with
a
shriek
of
distress
the
good
god
has
disappeared
from
the
altar
he
is
lost
j
ai
perdu
le
bon
dieu
il
est
disparu
de
dessus
l
autel
hoping
that
he
was
mistaken
and
that
he
had
only
thrown
away
the
good
god
le
bon
dieu
on
the
floor
by
some
accident
i
looked
on
the
altar
at
his
feet
everywhere
i
could
suspect
that
the
might
have
been
moved
away
by
some
mistake
of
the
hand
but
the
most
minute
search
was
of
no
avail
the
good
god
could
not
be
found
i
really
felt
stunned
at
first
remembering
the
thousand
miracles
i
had
read
of
the
disappearance
and
marvellous
changes
of
form
of
the
wafer
god
it
came
to
my
mind
that
we
were
in
the
presence
of
some
great
miracle
and
that
my
eyes
were
to
see
some
of
these
great
marvels
of
which
the
books
of
the
church
of
rome
are
filled
but
i
had
soon
to
change
my
mind
when
a
thought
flashed
through
my
memory
which
chilled
the
blood
in
my
veins
the
church
of
beauport
was
inhabited
by
a
multitude
of
the
boldest
and
most
insolent
rats
i
have
ever
seen
many
times
when
saying
my
mass
i
had
seen
the
ugly
nose
of
several
of
them
who
undoubtedly
attracted
by
the
smell
of
the
fresh
wafer
wanted
to
make
their
breakfast
with
the
body
blood
soul
and
divinity
of
my
christ
but
as
i
was
constantly
in
motion
or
praying
with
a
loud
voice
the
rats
had
invariably
been
frightened
and
fled
away
into
their
secret
quarters
i
felt
at
the
thought
that
the
good
god
le
bon
dieu
had
been
taken
away
and
eaten
by
the
rats
father
daule
so
sincerely
believed
what
all
the
priests
of
rome
are
bound
to
believe
that
he
had
the
power
to
turn
the
wafer
into
god
that
after
he
had
pronounced
the
words
by
which
the
great
marvel
was
wrought
he
used
to
pass
from
five
to
fifteen
minutes
in
silent
adoration
he
was
then
as
motionless
as
a
marble
statue
and
his
feelings
were
so
strong
that
often
torrents
of
tears
used
to
flow
from
his
eyes
on
his
cheeks
leaning
my
head
toward
the
distressed
old
priest
i
asked
him
have
you
not
remained
as
you
are
used
a
long
time
motionless
in
adoring
the
good
god
after
the
consecration
he
quickly
answered
yes
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
loss
of
the
good
god
i
replied
in
a
low
voice
but
with
a
real
accent
of
distress
and
awe
some
rats
have
dragged
and
eaten
the
good
god
what
do
you
say
replied
father
daule
the
good
god
carried
away
and
eaten
by
rats
yes
i
replied
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
about
my
god
my
god
what
a
dreadful
calamity
upon
me
rejoined
the
old
man
and
raising
his
hands
and
his
eyes
to
heaven
he
cried
out
again
my
god
my
god
why
have
you
not
taken
away
my
life
before
such
a
misfortune
could
fall
upon
me
he
could
not
speak
any
longer
his
voice
was
choked
by
his
sobs
at
first
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
a
thousand
thoughts
some
very
grave
some
exceedingly
ludicrous
crossed
my
mind
more
rapidly
than
i
can
say
them
i
stood
there
as
nailed
to
the
floor
by
the
old
priest
who
was
weeping
as
a
child
till
he
asked
me
with
a
voice
broken
by
his
sobs
what
must
i
do
now
i
answered
him
the
church
has
foreseen
occurrences
of
that
kind
and
provided
for
them
the
remedy
the
only
thing
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
a
new
wafer
consecrate
it
and
continue
your
mass
as
if
nothing
strange
had
occurred
i
will
go
and
get
you
just
now
new
i
went
without
losing
a
moment
to
the
vestry
got
and
brought
a
new
wafer
which
he
consecrated
and
turned
into
a
new
god
and
finished
his
mass
as
i
had
told
him
after
it
was
over
i
took
the
disconsolate
old
priest
by
the
hand
to
my
parsonage
for
breakfast
but
all
along
the
way
he
rent
the
air
with
his
cries
of
distress
he
would
hardly
taste
anything
for
his
soul
was
drowned
in
a
sea
of
trouble
i
vainly
tried
to
calm
his
feelings
by
telling
him
that
it
was
no
fault
of
his
that
this
strange
and
sad
occurrence
was
not
the
first
of
that
kind
that
it
had
been
calmly
foreseen
by
the
church
which
had
told
us
what
to
do
in
these
circumstances
that
there
was
no
neglect
no
fault
no
offence
against
god
or
man
on
his
part
but
as
he
would
not
pay
the
least
attention
to
what
i
said
i
felt
the
only
thing
i
had
to
do
was
to
remain
silent
and
respect
his
grief
by
letting
him
unburden
his
heart
by
his
lamentations
and
tears
i
had
hoped
that
his
good
common
sense
would
help
him
to
overcome
his
feelings
but
i
was
mistaken
his
lamentations
were
as
long
as
those
of
jeremiah
and
the
expressions
of
his
grief
as
bitter
at
last
i
lost
patience
and
said
my
dear
father
daule
allow
me
to
tell
you
respectfully
that
it
is
quite
time
to
stop
these
lamentations
and
tears
our
great
and
just
god
can
not
like
such
an
excess
of
sorrow
and
regret
about
a
thing
which
was
only
and
entirely
under
the
control
of
his
power
and
eternal
what
do
you
say
there
replied
the
old
priest
with
a
vivacity
which
resembled
anger
i
say
that
as
it
was
not
in
your
power
to
foresee
or
to
avoid
that
occurrence
you
have
not
the
least
reason
to
act
and
speak
as
you
do
let
us
keep
our
regrets
and
our
tears
for
our
sins
we
can
not
shed
too
many
tears
on
them
but
there
is
no
sin
here
and
there
must
be
some
reasonable
limit
to
our
sorrow
if
anybody
had
to
weep
and
regret
without
measure
what
has
happened
it
would
be
christ
for
he
alone
could
foresee
that
event
and
he
alone
could
prevent
it
had
it
been
his
will
to
oppose
this
sad
and
mysterious
act
it
was
in
his
not
in
our
power
to
prevent
it
he
alone
has
suffered
from
it
because
it
was
his
will
to
suffer
mr
chiniquy
he
replied
you
are
quite
a
young
man
and
i
see
you
have
the
want
of
attention
and
experience
which
are
often
seen
among
young
priests
you
do
not
pay
a
sufficient
attention
to
the
awful
calamity
which
has
just
occurred
in
your
church
if
you
had
more
faith
and
piety
you
would
weep
with
me
instead
of
laughing
at
my
grief
how
can
you
speak
so
lightly
of
a
thing
which
makes
the
angels
of
god
weep
our
dear
saviour
dragged
and
eaten
by
rats
oh
great
god
does
not
this
surpass
the
humiliation
and
horrors
of
calvary
my
dear
father
daule
i
replied
allow
me
respectfully
to
tell
you
that
i
understand
as
well
as
you
do
the
nature
of
the
deplorable
event
of
this
morning
i
would
have
given
my
blood
to
prevent
it
but
let
us
look
at
that
fact
in
its
proper
light
it
is
not
a
moral
action
for
us
it
did
not
depend
on
our
will
more
than
the
spots
of
the
sun
the
only
one
who
is
accountable
for
that
fact
is
our
god
for
again
i
say
that
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
foresee
and
prevent
it
and
to
give
you
plainly
my
own
mind
i
tell
you
here
that
if
i
were
god
almighty
and
a
miserable
rat
would
come
to
eat
me
i
would
strike
him
dead
before
he
could
touch
there
is
no
need
of
confessing
it
here
every
one
who
reads
these
pages
and
pays
attention
to
this
conversation
will
understand
that
my
former
so
robust
faith
in
my
priestly
power
of
changing
the
wafer
into
my
god
had
melted
away
and
evaporated
from
my
mind
if
not
entirely
at
least
to
a
great
extent
great
and
new
lights
had
flashed
through
my
soul
in
that
hour
evidently
my
god
wanted
to
open
my
eyes
to
the
awful
absurdities
and
impieties
of
a
religion
whose
god
could
be
dragged
and
eaten
by
rats
had
i
been
faithful
to
the
saving
lights
which
were
in
me
then
i
was
saved
in
that
very
hour
and
before
the
end
of
that
day
i
would
have
broken
the
shameful
chains
by
which
the
pope
had
tied
my
neck
to
his
idol
of
bread
in
that
hour
it
seemed
to
me
evident
that
the
dogma
of
transubstantiation
was
a
sic
monstrous
imposture
and
my
priesthood
an
insult
to
god
and
man
my
intelligence
said
to
me
with
a
thundering
voice
do
not
remain
any
longer
the
priest
of
a
god
whom
you
make
every
day
and
whom
the
rats
can
though
blind
father
daule
understood
very
well
by
the
stern
accents
of
my
voice
that
my
faith
in
the
god
whom
he
had
created
that
morning
and
whom
the
rats
had
eaten
had
been
seriously
modified
if
not
entirely
crumbled
down
he
remained
silent
for
some
time
after
which
he
invited
me
to
sit
by
him
and
he
spoke
to
me
with
a
pathos
and
an
authority
which
my
youth
and
his
old
age
alone
could
justify
he
gave
me
the
most
awful
rebuke
i
ever
had
he
opened
on
my
poor
wavering
intelligence
soul
and
heart
all
the
cataracts
of
heaven
he
overwhelmed
me
with
a
deluge
of
holy
fathers
councils
and
infallible
popes
who
had
believed
and
preached
before
the
whole
world
in
all
ages
the
dogma
of
transubstantiation
if
i
had
paid
attention
to
the
voice
of
my
intelligence
and
accepted
the
lights
which
my
merciful
god
was
giving
me
i
could
easily
have
smashed
the
arguments
of
the
old
priest
of
rome
but
what
has
the
intelligence
to
do
in
the
church
of
rome
what
could
my
intelligence
say
i
was
forbidden
to
hear
it
what
was
the
weight
of
my
poor
isolated
intelligence
when
put
in
the
balance
against
so
many
learned
holy
infallible
intelligences
alas
i
was
not
aware
then
that
the
weight
of
the
intelligence
of
god
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
was
on
my
side
and
that
weighted
against
the
intelligence
of
the
popes
they
were
greater
than
all
the
words
against
a
grain
of
sand
one
hour
after
shedding
tears
of
regret
i
was
at
the
feet
of
father
daule
in
the
confessional
box
confessing
the
great
sin
i
had
committed
by
doubting
for
a
moment
of
the
power
of
the
priests
to
change
a
wafer
into
god
the
old
priest
whose
voice
had
been
like
a
lion
s
voice
when
speaking
to
the
unbelieving
curate
of
beauport
had
become
sweet
as
the
voice
of
a
lamb
when
he
had
me
at
his
feet
confessing
my
unbelief
he
gave
me
my
pardon
for
my
penance
he
forbade
me
ever
to
say
a
word
on
the
sad
end
of
the
god
he
had
created
that
morning
for
said
he
this
would
destroy
the
faith
of
the
most
sincere
roman
for
the
other
part
of
the
penance
i
had
to
go
on
my
knees
every
day
during
nine
days
before
the
fourteen
images
of
the
way
of
the
cross
and
say
a
penitential
psalm
before
every
picture
which
i
did
but
the
sixth
day
the
skin
of
my
knees
was
pierced
and
the
blood
was
flowing
freely
i
suffered
real
torture
every
time
i
kneeled
down
and
at
every
step
i
made
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
terrible
tortures
were
nothing
compared
to
my
great
iniquity
i
had
refused
for
a
moment
to
believe
that
a
man
can
create
his
god
with
a
wafer
and
i
had
thought
that
a
church
which
adores
a
god
eaten
by
rats
must
be
an
idolatrous
church
chapter
xxxvii
visit
of
a
protestant
throws
an
arrow
into
my
priestly
soul
never
to
be
taken
out
a
few
days
before
the
arrival
of
bishop
de
forbin
janson
i
was
alone
in
my
study
considering
my
false
position
toward
my
ecclesiastical
superiors
on
account
of
my
establishing
the
temperance
society
against
their
formal
protest
my
heart
was
sad
my
partial
success
had
not
blinded
me
to
the
reality
of
my
deplorable
isolation
from
the
great
mass
of
the
clergy
with
very
few
exceptions
they
were
speaking
of
me
as
a
dangerous
man
they
had
even
given
me
the
nickname
of
reformateur
au
petit
reformer
and
were
losing
no
opportunity
of
showing
me
their
supreme
contempt
and
indignation
for
what
they
called
my
obstinacy
in
that
sad
hour
there
were
many
clouds
around
my
horizon
and
my
mind
was
filled
with
anxiety
when
suddenly
a
stranger
knocked
at
my
door
he
was
a
man
his
smiling
lips
and
honest
face
were
beaming
with
the
utmost
kindness
his
large
and
noble
forehead
told
me
at
once
that
my
visitor
was
a
man
of
superior
intellect
his
whole
mien
was
that
of
a
true
gentleman
he
pressed
my
hand
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
friend
and
giving
me
his
name
he
told
me
at
once
the
object
of
his
visit
in
these
words
i
do
not
come
here
only
in
my
name
but
it
is
in
the
name
of
many
if
not
of
all
the
people
of
quebec
and
canada
i
want
to
tell
you
our
admiration
for
the
great
reform
you
have
accomplished
in
beauport
we
know
the
stern
opposition
of
your
superiors
and
to
your
efforts
and
we
admire
you
more
for
that
go
on
sir
you
have
on
your
side
the
great
god
of
heaven
who
has
said
to
us
all
look
not
thou
upon
the
wine
when
it
is
red
when
it
giveth
its
color
in
the
cup
when
it
moveth
itself
aright
at
the
last
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
it
stingeth
like
an
take
courage
sir
he
added
you
have
on
your
side
the
saviour
of
the
world
jesus
christ
himself
who
has
inspired
his
apostle
paul
to
say
i
will
not
drink
any
wine
if
it
can
be
a
cause
of
sin
to
my
fear
not
man
sir
when
god
the
father
and
his
son
jesus
christ
are
on
your
side
if
you
find
any
opposition
from
some
quarter
and
if
deluded
men
turn
you
into
ridicule
when
you
are
doing
such
a
christian
work
bless
the
lord
for
jesus
christ
has
said
blessed
are
they
who
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
for
they
shall
be
filled
blessed
are
ye
when
men
shall
revile
you
and
persecute
you
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
i
come
also
to
tell
you
sir
that
if
there
are
men
who
oppose
you
there
are
many
more
who
are
praying
for
you
day
and
night
asking
our
heavenly
father
to
pour
upon
you
his
most
abundant
blessings
intoxicating
drinks
are
the
curse
of
this
young
country
it
is
the
most
deadly
foe
of
every
father
and
mother
the
most
implacable
enemy
of
every
child
in
canada
it
is
the
ruin
of
our
rich
families
as
well
as
the
destruction
of
the
poor
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
under
any
form
or
pretext
is
an
act
of
supreme
folly
for
alcohol
kills
the
body
and
damns
the
soul
of
its
blind
victim
you
have
for
the
first
time
raised
the
glorious
banners
of
temperance
among
the
french
canadian
people
though
you
are
alone
to
lift
it
up
be
not
discouraged
for
before
long
you
will
see
your
intelligent
countrymen
rallying
around
it
to
help
you
to
fight
and
conquer
no
doubt
the
seed
you
sow
is
often
watered
with
your
tears
but
before
long
you
will
reap
the
richest
crop
and
your
heart
will
be
filled
with
joy
when
your
grateful
country
will
bless
your
after
a
few
other
sentences
of
the
same
elevated
sentiments
he
hardly
gave
me
time
enough
to
express
my
feelings
of
gratitude
and
said
i
know
you
are
very
busy
i
do
not
want
to
trespass
upon
your
time
sir
may
the
lord
bless
you
and
be
your
keeper
in
all
your
he
pressed
my
hand
and
soon
disappeared
i
would
try
in
vain
to
express
what
i
felt
when
alone
with
my
god
after
that
strange
and
providential
visit
my
first
thought
was
to
fall
on
my
knees
and
thank
that
merciful
god
for
having
sent
me
such
a
messenger
to
cheer
me
in
one
of
the
darkest
hours
of
my
life
for
every
word
from
his
lips
had
fallen
on
my
wounded
soul
as
the
oil
of
the
good
samaritan
on
the
bleeding
wounds
of
the
traveler
to
jericho
there
had
been
such
an
elevation
of
thought
such
a
ring
of
true
simple
but
sublime
faith
and
piety
such
love
of
man
and
fear
of
god
in
all
that
he
had
said
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
words
so
conformable
to
my
personal
views
and
profound
convictions
on
that
subject
that
stranger
whose
visit
had
passed
as
quickly
as
the
visit
of
an
angel
from
god
had
filled
my
heart
with
such
joy
and
surprise
at
the
unexpected
news
that
all
the
people
of
canada
were
praying
for
me
however
i
did
not
fall
on
my
knees
to
thank
god
for
my
sentiments
of
gratitude
to
god
were
suddenly
chilled
by
the
unspeakable
humiliation
i
felt
when
i
considered
that
that
stranger
was
a
protestant
the
comparison
i
was
forced
to
make
between
the
noble
sentiments
the
high
philosophy
the
christian
principles
of
that
protestant
layman
with
the
low
expressions
of
contempt
the
absolute
want
of
generous
and
christian
thoughts
of
my
bishop
and
my
when
they
were
turning
into
ridicule
that
temperance
society
which
god
was
so
visibly
presenting
to
us
as
the
best
if
not
the
only
way
to
save
the
thousands
of
drunkards
who
were
perishing
around
us
paralyzed
my
lips
bewildered
my
mind
and
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
utter
a
word
of
prayer
my
first
sentiments
of
joy
and
of
gratitude
to
god
soon
gave
way
to
sentiments
of
unspeakable
shame
and
distress
i
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
these
protestants
whom
my
church
had
taught
me
through
all
her
councils
to
anathematize
and
curse
as
the
damned
slaves
and
followers
of
satan
were
in
their
principles
of
morality
higher
above
us
than
the
heavens
are
above
the
earth
i
had
to
confess
to
myself
that
those
heretics
whom
my
church
had
taught
me
to
consider
as
rebels
against
christ
and
his
church
knew
the
laws
of
god
and
followed
them
much
more
closely
than
ourselves
they
had
raised
themselves
to
the
highest
degree
of
christian
temperance
when
my
bishops
with
their
priests
were
swimming
in
the
deadly
waters
of
drunkenness
a
voice
seemed
crying
to
me
where
is
the
superiority
of
holiness
of
your
proud
church
of
rome
over
those
heretics
who
follow
more
closely
the
counsels
and
precepts
of
the
gospel
of
christ
i
tried
to
stifle
that
voice
but
i
could
not
louder
and
louder
it
was
heard
asking
me
who
is
nearer
bishop
who
so
obstinately
opposes
a
reform
which
is
so
evidently
according
to
the
divine
word
or
those
earnest
followers
of
the
gospel
who
make
the
sacrifice
of
their
old
and
most
cherished
usages
with
such
pleasure
when
they
see
it
is
for
the
good
of
their
and
the
glory
of
god
i
wished
then
to
be
a
hundred
feet
below
the
ground
in
order
not
to
hear
those
questions
answered
within
my
soul
but
there
was
no
help
i
had
to
hear
them
and
to
blush
at
the
reality
before
my
eyes
pride
yes
diabolical
pride
is
the
vice
of
every
priest
of
rome
just
as
he
is
taught
to
believe
and
say
that
his
church
is
far
above
every
other
church
so
he
is
taught
to
believe
and
say
that
as
a
priest
he
is
above
all
the
kings
emperors
governors
and
presidents
of
this
world
pride
is
the
daily
bread
of
the
pope
the
bishop
the
priests
and
even
the
lowest
layman
in
the
church
of
rome
it
is
also
the
great
secret
of
their
power
and
strength
it
is
this
diabolical
pride
which
nerves
them
with
an
iron
will
to
bring
down
everything
to
their
feet
subject
every
human
being
to
their
will
and
tie
every
neck
to
the
wheels
of
their
chariot
it
is
this
fearful
pride
which
so
often
gives
them
that
stoical
patience
and
indomitable
courage
in
the
midst
of
the
most
cruel
pain
or
in
the
face
of
the
most
appalling
death
which
so
many
deluded
protestants
take
for
christian
courage
and
heroism
the
priest
of
rome
believes
that
he
is
called
by
god
almighty
to
rule
subdue
and
govern
the
world
with
all
those
prerogatives
that
he
fancies
granted
him
by
heaven
he
builds
up
a
high
pyramid
on
the
top
of
which
he
seats
himself
and
from
that
elevation
looks
down
with
the
utmost
contempt
on
the
rest
of
the
world
if
anyone
suspects
that
i
exaggerate
in
thus
speaking
of
the
pride
of
the
priest
let
him
read
the
following
haughty
words
which
cardinal
manning
puts
on
the
lips
of
the
pope
in
one
of
his
lectures
i
acknowledge
no
civil
power
i
am
the
subject
of
no
prince
i
am
more
than
this
i
claim
to
be
the
supreme
judge
and
director
of
the
conscience
of
men
of
the
peasant
who
tills
his
field
and
of
the
prince
who
sits
upon
the
throne
of
the
household
that
lives
in
the
shade
of
privacy
and
the
legislator
that
makes
laws
for
the
kingdom
i
am
the
sole
last
supreme
judge
of
what
is
right
or
is
it
not
evident
that
the
holy
ghost
speaks
of
this
pride
of
the
priests
and
of
the
high
priest
of
he
says
that
man
of
sin
that
son
of
perdition
who
opposeth
and
exalteth
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
or
that
is
worshipped
so
that
he
as
god
sits
in
the
temple
of
god
showing
himself
that
he
is
that
caste
pride
which
was
in
me
though
i
did
not
see
it
then
as
it
is
in
every
priest
of
rome
though
he
does
not
suspect
it
had
received
a
rude
check
indeed
from
that
protestant
visitor
yes
i
must
confess
it
he
had
inflicted
a
deadly
wound
on
my
priestly
pride
he
had
thrown
a
barbed
arrow
into
my
priestly
soul
which
i
tried
many
times
but
always
in
vain
to
take
away
the
more
i
attempted
to
get
rid
of
this
arrow
the
deeper
it
went
through
my
very
bones
and
marrow
that
strange
visitor
who
caused
me
to
pass
so
many
hours
and
days
of
humiliation
when
forcing
me
to
blush
at
the
inferiority
of
the
christian
principles
of
my
church
compared
with
those

the
protestants

known

his
name
is
john

as
he
is
still
living
i
am
happy
to
have
this
opportunity
of
thanking
and
blessing
him
again
for
the
visit
he
paid
to
the
young
curate
of
beauport
years
ago
i
was
not
aware
then
that
the
wounds
inflicted
by
that
unknown
but
friendly
hand
was
one
of
the
great
favors
bestowed
upon
me
by
my
merciful
god
but
i
understand
it
now
many
rays
of
light
have
since
come
from
the
wounds
which
my
priestly
pride
received
that
day
those
rays
of
light
helped
much
to
expel
the
darkness
which
surrounded
me
by
leading
me
to
see
in
spite
of
myself
that
the
vaunted
holiness
of
the
church
of
rome
is
a
fraud

the

fought
and
gained
at
the
grand
dinner
of
the
quebec

by
the
society

had
been
decisive
the
triumph
was
as
complete
as
it
was
glorious
hereafter
her
march

was
to
be
a
triumph
her
blessed
banners
were
soon
to
be
planted
over
all
the
cities

of
my
dear
country
to
commemorate
the
expression
of
their
joy
and
gratitude
to
god
to
the
remotest
generations
the
people
of

erected

beautiful

is
still
seen

my
lord

blessed

in

of

of

with

were
the
first
after
lange
gardien
chateau
richer
anne
and
joachin
to
request
me
to
preach
on
temperance
soon
after
the
whole
population
of
roch
quebec
took
the
pledge
with
a
wonderful
unanimity
and
kept
it
long
with
marvellous
fidelity
in
order
to
show
to
the
whole
country
their
feelings
of
gratitude
they
presented
me
with
a
fine
picture
of
the
column
of
temperance
and
a
complimentary
address
written
and
delivered
by
one
of
the
most
promising
young
men
of
quebec
john
cauchon
who
was
raised
some
years
later
to
the
dignity
of
a
cabinet
minister
and
who
has
been
the
worthy
of
manitoba
that
address
was
soon
followed
by
another
from
the
citizens
of
quebec
and
beauport
presented
along
with
my
portrait
by
joseph
parent
then
editor
of
the
and
afterwards
provincial
secretary
of
canada
what
a
strange
being
man
is
how
fickle
are
his
judgments
in
they
had
no
words
sufficiently
flattering
to
praise
the
very
man
in
the
face
of
whom
they
were
spitting
in
for
doing
the
very
same
thing
was
i
better
for
establishing
the
society
of
temperance
in
than
i
was
in
establishing
it
in
no
and
was
i
worse
when
in
bishops
priests
and
people
were
abusing
slandering
and
giving
me
bad
names
for
raising
the
banners
of
temperance
over
my
country
than
i
was
in
continuing
to
lift
it
up
in
no
the
sudden
and
complete
change
of
the
judgment
of
men
in
such
a
short
period
of
time
had
the
good
and
providential
effect
of
filling
my
mind
with
the
most
supreme
indifference
not
to
say
contempt
for
what
men
thought
or
said
of
me
yea
this
sudden
passage
from
condemnation
to
that
of
praise
when
i
was
doing
the
very
same
work
had
the
good
effect
to
cure
me
of
that
natural
pride
which
one
is
apt
to
feel
when
publicly
applauded
by
men
it
is
to
that
knowledge
acquired
when
young
that
i
owe
the
preservation
of
my
dignity
as
man
and
priest
when
all
my
bishops
and
their
priests
were
arrayed
against
me
at
the
dining
table
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
it
is
that
knowledge
also
that
taught
me
not
to
forget
that
i
was
nothing
but
a
worm
of
the
dust
and
an
unprofitable
servant
of
god
when
the
same
men
overwhelmed
me
with
their
unmerited
praises
let
not
my
readers
think
however
that
i
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
this
change
of
public
feeling
for
no
words
can
tell
the
joy
i
felt
at
the
assurance
which
these
public
manifestations
afforded
me
that
the
cause
of
temperance
was
to
triumph
everywhere
in
my
country
let
me
here
tell
a
fact
too
honorable
to
the
people
of
beauport
to
be
omitted
as
soon
as
the
demon
of
intemperance
was
driven
from
my
parish
i
felt
that
my
first
duty
was
to
give
my
attention
to
education
which
had
been
so
shamefully
neglected
by
my
predecessors
that
there
was
not
a
single
school
in
the
parish
worthy
of
that
name
i
proposed
my
plan
to
the
people
asked
their
and
set
to
work
without
delay
i
began
by
erecting
the
fine
stone
school
house
near
the
church
on
the
site
of
the
old
parsonage
the
old
walls
were
pulled
down
and
on
the
old
foundation
a
good
structure
was
soon
erected
with
the
free
collections
raised
in
the
village
but
the
work
was
hardly
half
finished
when
i
found
myself
without
a
cent
to
carry
it
on
i
saw
at
once
that
having
no
idea
of
the
value
of
education
the
people
would
murmur
at
my
asking
any
more
money
i
therefore
sold
my
horse
a
fine
animal
given
me
by
a
rich
uncle
and
with
the
money
finished
the
building
my
people
felt
humiliated
and
pained
at
seeing
their
pastor
obliged
to
walk
when
going
to
quebec
or
visiting
the
sick
they
said
to
each
other
is
it
not
a
burning
shame
for
us
to
have
forced
our
young
curate
to
sell
his
fine
horse
to
build
our
school
houses
when
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
do
that
work
ourselves
let
us
repair
our
on
my
return
from
establishing
the
society
of
temperance
in
john
two
weeks
later
my
servant
man
said
to
me
please
le
cure
come
to
the
stable
and
see
a
very
curious
what
curious
thing
can
there
be
i
answered
well
sir
please
come
and
you
will
what
was
both
my
surprise
and
pleasure
to
find
one
of
the
most
splendid
canadian
horses
there
as
mine
for
my
servant
said
to
me
during
your
absence
the
people
have
raised
five
hundred
dollars
and
bought
this
fine
horse
for
you
they
say
they
do
not
want
any
longer
to
see
their
curate
walking
in
the
mud
when
they
drove
the
horse
here
that
i
might
present
him
to
you
as
a
surprise
on
your
arrival
i
heard
them
saying
that
with
the
temperance
society
you
have
saved
them
more
than
five
hundred
dollars
every
week
in
money
time
and
health
and
that
it
was
only
an
act
of
justice
to
give
you
the
savings
of
a
the
only
way
of
expressing
my
gratitude
to
my
noble
people
was
to
redouble
my
exertions
in
securing
the
benefits
of
a
good
education
to
their
children
i
soon
proposed
to
the
people
to
build
another
school
house
two
miles
distant
from
the
first
but
i
was
not
long
without
seeing
that
this
new
enterprise
was
to
be
still
more
uphill
work
than
the
first
one
among
the
people
of
whom
hardly
one
in
fifty
could
sign
his
name
have
not
our
fathers
done
well
without
those
costly
schools
said
many
what
is
the
use
of
spending
so
much
money
for
a
thing
that
does
not
add
a
day
to
our
existence
nor
an
atom
to
our
comfort
i
soon
felt
confronted
by
such
a
deadly
indifference
not
to
say
opposition
on
the
part
of
my
best
farmers
that
i
feared
for
a
few
days
lest
i
had
really
gone
too
far
the
last
cent
of
my
own
revenues
was
not
only
given
but
a
little
personal
debt
created
to
meet
the
payments
and
a
round
sum
of
had
to
be
found
to
finish
the
work
i
visited
the
richest
man
of
beauport
to
ask
him
to
come
to
my
rescue
forty
years
before
he
had
come
to
beauport
barefooted
without
a
cent
to
work
he
had
employed
his
first
earned
dollars
in
purchasing
some
rum
with
which
he
had
doubled
his
money
in
two
hours
and
had
continued
to
double
his
money
at
that
rate
in
the
same
way
till
he
was
worth
nearly
he
had
then
stopped
selling
rum
to
invest
his
money
in
city
properties
he
answered
me
my
dear
curate
i
would
have
no
objections
to
give
you
the
you
want
if
i
had
not
met
the
grand
vicar
demars
yesterday
who
warned
me
as
an
old
friend
against
what
he
calls
your
dangerous
and
exaggerated
views
in
reference
to
the
education
of
the
people
he
advised
me
for
your
own
good
and
the
good
of
the
people
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
induce
you
to
desist
from
your
plan
of
covering
our
parishes
with
will
you
allow
me
i
answered
to
mention
our
conversation
to
demars
and
tell
him
what
you
have
just
said
about
his
advising
you
to
oppose
me
in
my
efforts
to
promote
the
interests
of
education
yes
sir
by
all
means
answered
des
roussell
i
allow
you
to
repeat
to
the
venerable
superior
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
what
he
said
to
me
yesterday
it
was
not
a
secret
for
there
were
several
other
farmers
of
beauport
to
whom
he
said
the
very
same
thing
if
you
ignore
that
the
priests
of
quebec
are
opposed
to
your
plans
of
educating
our
children
you
must
be
the
only
one
who
does
not
know
it
for
it
is
a
public
fact
your
difficulties
in
raising
the
funds
you
want
come
only
from
the
opposition
of
the
rest
of
the
clergy
to
you
in
this
matter
we
have
plenty
of
money
in
beauport
and
we
would
feel
happy
to
help
you
but
you
understand
that
our
is
somewhat
cooled
by
the
opposition
of
men
whom
we
are
accustomed
to
i
replied
do
you
not
remember
my
dear
des
roussell
that
those
very
same
priests
opposed
me
in
the
same
way
in
my
very
first
efforts
to
establish
the
temperance
society
in
your
midst
yes
sir
he
answered
with
a
smile
we
remember
it
well
but
you
have
converted
them
to
your
views
well
my
dear
sir
i
hope
we
shall
convert
them
also
in
this
question
of
the
very
next
morning
i
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
rev
grand
vicar
demars
after
i
had
tied
my
splendid
horse
in
the
courtyard
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
i
was
received
with
the
utmost
marks
of
courtesy
without
losing
any
time
i
repeated
to
the
old
superior
what
des
roussell
had
told
me
of
his
opposition
to
my
educational
plans
and
respectfully
asked
him
if
it
were
true
the
poor
grand
vicar
seemed
as
if
by
my
abrupt
though
polite
question
he
tried
at
first
to
explain
what
he
had
said
by
taking
a
long
circuit
but
i
mercilessly
brought
him
to
the
point
at
issue
and
forced
him
to
say
yes
i
said
i
then
rejoined
and
said
mr
grand
vicar
i
am
only
a
child
before
you
when
comparing
my
age
with
yours
however
i
have
the
honor
to
be
the
curate
of
beauport
it
is
in
that
capacity
that
i
respectfully
ask
you
by
what
right
you
oppose
my
plans
for
educating
our
children
i
hope
chiniquy
he
answered
that
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
am
the
enemy
of
education
for
i
would
answer
you
that
this
is
the
first
house
of
education
on
this
continent
and
that
i
was
at
its
head
before
you
were
born
i
hope
that
i
have
the
right
to
believe
and
say
that
the
old
superior
of
the
seminary
of
quebec
understands
as
well
as
the
young
curate
of
beauport
the
advantage
of
a
good
education
but
i
will
repeat
to
you
what
i
said
to
des
roussell
that
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
introduce
such
a
general
system
of
education
as
you
want
to
do
in
beauport
let
every
parish
have
its
well
educated
notary
doctor
merchants
and
a
few
others
to
do
the
public
business
that
is
enough
our
parishes
of
canada
are
models
of
peace
and
harmony
under
the
direction
of
their
good
curates
but
they
will
become
unmanageable
the
very
day
your
system
of
education
spreads
abroad
for
then
all
the
bad
propensities
of
the
heart
will
be
developed
with
an
irresistible
force
besides
you
know
that
since
the
conquest
of
canada
by
protestant
england
the
protestants
are
waiting
for
their
opportunity
to
spread
the
bible
among
our
people
the
only
barrier
we
can
oppose
to
that
danger
is
to
have
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
only
a
very
limited
number
of
our
people
who
can
read
or
write
for
as
soon
as
the
common
people
are
able
to
read
they
will
like
adam
and
eve
taste
the
forbidden
fruit
they
will
read
the
bible
turn
protestant
and
be
lost
for
time
and
in
my
answer
among
other
things
i
said
go
into
the
country
look
at
the
farm
which
is
well
cultivated
ploughed
with
attention
and
skill
richly
manured
and
sown
with
good
seed
is
it
not
infinitely
more
pleasant
and
beautiful
to
live
on
such
a
farm
than
on
one
which
is
neglected
unskilfully
managed
and
covered
with
noxious
weeds
well
the
difference
between
a
and
an
uneducated
people
is
still
greater
in
my
mind
i
know
that
the
priests
of
canada
in
general
have
your
views
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
parish
of
beauport
with
its
immense
revenues
has
been
left
without
a
school
worthy
the
name
from
its
foundation
till
my
going
there
but
my
views
are
absolutely
different
and
as
for
your
fear
of
the
bible
i
confess
we
are
antipodes
to
each
other
i
consider
that
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
god
has
bestowed
upon
me
is
that
i
have
read
the
bible
when
i
was
on
my
mother
s
knees
i
do
not
even
conceal
from
you
that
one
of
my
objects
in
giving
a
good
education
to
every
boy
and
girl
of
beauport
is
to
put
the
gospel
of
christ
in
their
hands
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
read
at
the
end
of
our
conversation
which
was
very
excited
on
both
sides
though
kept
in
the
bounds
of
politeness
during
nearly
two
hours
i
said
mr
grand
vicar
i
did
not
come
here
to
convert
you
to
my
would
have
been
impertinence
on
my
part
nor
can
you
convert
me
to
yours
if
you
are
trying
it
for
you
know
i
have
the
bad
reputation
of
being
a
hard
case
i
came
to
ask
you
as
a
favor
to
let
me
work
according
to
my
conscience
in
a
parish
which
is
mine
and
not
yours
do
not
interfere
any
more
in
my
affairs
between
me
and
my
parishioners
than
you
would
like
me
to
interfere
in
the
management
of
your
seminary
as
you
would
not
like
me
to
criticize
you
before
your
pupils
and
turn
you
into
ridicule
please
cease
adding
to
my
difficulties
among
my
people
by
continuing
in
the
future
what
you
have
done
in
the
past
you
know
grand
vicar
that
i
have
always
respected
you
as
my
father
you
have
many
times
been
my
adviser
my
confessor
and
my
friend
i
hope
you
will
grant
me
the
favor
i
ask
from
you
in
the
name
of
our
common
saviour
it
is
for
the
spiritual
and
temporal
good
of
the
people
and
pastor
of
beauport
that
i
make
this
the
old
priest
was
a
man
these
last
words
melted
his
heart
he
promised
what
i
wanted
and
we
parted
from
each
other
on
better
terms
than
i
had
expected
at
first
when
crossing
the
courtyard
of
the
seminary
i
saw
the
archbishop
signaie
who
coming
from
taking
a
ride
had
stopped
to
look
at
my
horse
and
admire
it
when
near
him
i
said
my
lord
this
is
a
bishop
s
horse
and
ought
to
be
in
your
it
is
what
i
was
saying
to
my
secretary
replied
the
bishop
how
long
is
it
since
you
got
it
only
a
few
days
ago
my
have
you
any
intention
of
selling
it
i
would
if
it
would
please
my
bishop
i
replied
what
is
the
price
asked
the
bishop
those
who
gave
it
to
me
paid
for
it
i
replied
oh
oh
that
is
too
dear
rejoined
the
bishop
with
five
hundred
dollars
we
can
get
five
good
horses
two
hundred
would
be
your
lordship
is
joking
were
i
as
rich
as
i
am
poor
one
thousand
dollars
would
not
take
that
noble
animal
from
my
hands
except
to
have
it
put
in
the
carosse
of
my
go
and
make
a
check
for
two
hundred
dollars
to
the
order
of
chiniquy
said
the
bishop
to
his
belisle
when
the
secretary
had
gone
to
make
the
check
the
bishop
being
alone
with
me
took
from
his
portfeuille
three
bank
bills
of
one
hundred
dollars
each
and
put
them
into
my
hands
saying
this
will
make
up
your
when
my
secretary
gives
you
the
check
but
please
say
nothing
to
anybody
not
even
to
my
secretary
i
do
not
like
to
have
my
private
affairs
talked
of
around
the
corners
of
the
streets
that
horse
is
the
most
splendid
i
ever
saw
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
having
sold
it
to
i
was
also
very
glad
to
have
in
hand
for
with
i
could
finish
my
school
house
and
there
was
more
to
begin
another
three
miles
distant
just
two
weeks
later
when
i
was
dressing
myself
at
sunrise
my
servant
came
to
my
room
and
said
there
are
twenty
men
on
horseback
who
want
to
speak
to
twenty
men
on
horseback
who
want
to
speak
to
me
i
answered
are
you
dreaming
i
do
not
dream
answered
my
young
man
there
they
are
at
the
door
on
horseback
waiting
for
i
was
soon
dressed
and
in
the
presence
of
twenty
of
my
best
farmers
on
horseback
who
had
formed
themselves
in
a
to
receive
me
what
do
you
want
my
friends
i
asked
them
one
of
them
who
had
studied
a
few
years
in
the
seminary
of
quebec
answered
dear
pastor
we
come
in
the
name
of
the
whole
people
of
beauport
to
ask
your
pardon
for
having
saddened
your
heart
by
not
coming
as
we
ought
to
your
help
in
the
superhuman
efforts
you
make
to
give
good
schools
to
our
children
this
is
the
result
of
our
ignorance
having
never
gone
to
school
ourselves
the
greater
part
of
us
have
never
known
the
value
of
education
but
the
heroic
sacrifices
you
have
made
lately
have
opened
our
eyes
they
ought
to
have
been
opened
at
the
sale
of
your
first
horse
but
we
were
in
need
of
another
lesson
to
understand
our
meanness
however
the
selling
of
the
second
horse
has
done
more
than
anything
else
to
awaken
us
from
our
shameful
lethargy
the
fear
of
receiving
a
new
rebuke
from
us
if
you
made
another
appeal
to
our
generosity
has
forced
you
to
make
that
new
sacrifice
the
first
news
came
to
us
as
a
thunderbolt
but
there
is
always
some
light
in
a
thunderbolt
through
that
light
we
have
seen
our
profound
degradation
in
shutting
our
ears
to
your
earnest
and
paternal
appeals
in
favor
of
our
own
dear
children
be
sure
dear
pastor
that
we
are
ashamed
of
our
conduct
from
this
day
not
only
our
hearts
but
our
purses
are
yours
in
all
you
want
to
do
to
secure
a
good
education
for
our
families
however
our
principal
object
in
coming
here
is
not
to
say
vain
words
but
to
do
an
act
of
reparation
and
justice
our
first
thought
when
we
heard
that
you
had
sold
the
horse
we
had
given
you
was
to
present
you
with
another
we
have
been
prevented
from
doing
this
by
the
certainty
that
you
would
sell
it
again
either
to
help
some
poor
people
or
to
build
another
school
house
as
we
can
not
bear
to
see
our
pastor
walking
in
the
mud
when
going
to
the
city
or
visiting
us
we
have
determined
to
put
another
horse
into
your
hands
but
in
such
a
way
that
you
will
not
have
the
right
to
sell
it
we
ask
you
then
as
a
favor
to
select
the
best
horse
here
among
these
twenty
which
are
before
you
and
to
keep
it
as
long
as
you
remain
in
our
midst
which
we
hope
will
be
very
long
it
will
be
returned
to
its
present
possessor
if
you
leave
us
and
be
sure
dear
pastor
that
the
one
of
us
who
leaves
his
horse
in
your
hands
will
be
the
most
happy
and
proudest
of
when
speaking
thus
that
man
had
several
times
been
unable
to
conceal
the
tears
which
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
and
more
than
once
his
trembling
voice
had
been
choked
by
his
emotion
i
tried
in
vain
at
first
to
speak
my
feelings
of
gratitude
and
admiration
could
be
expressed
only
with
my
tears
it
took
some
time
before
i
could
utter
a
single
word
at
last
i
said
my
dear
friends
this
is
too
much
for
your
poor
pastor
i
feel
overwhelmed
by
this
grand
act
of
kindness
i
do
not
say
that
i
thank
word
thank
is
too
small
too
short
and
insignificant
to
tell
you
what
your
poor
unworthy
pastor
feels
at
what
his
eyes
see
and
his
ears
hear
just
now
the
great
and
merciful
god
who
has
put
those
sentiments
into
your
hearts
alone
can
repay
you
for
the
joy
with
which
you
fill
my
soul
i
would
hurt
your
feelings
i
know
by
not
accepting
your
offering
i
accept
it
but
to
punish
your
speaker
parent
for
his
complimentary
address
i
will
take
his
horse
for
the
time
i
am
curate
of
beauport
which
i
hope
will
be
till
i
and
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
bridle
of
the
splendid
animal
there
was
then
a
struggle
which
i
had
not
expected
every
one
of
the
nineteen
whom
i
left
with
their
horses
began
to
cry
oh
do
not
take
that
horse
it
is
not
worth
a
penny
mine
is
much
stronger
said
one
mine
is
much
faster
cried
out
another
mine
is
a
safe
rider
said
a
third
every
one
wanted
me
to
take
his
horse
and
tried
to
persuade
me
that
it
was
the
best
of
all
they
really
felt
sorry
that
they
were
not
able
to
change
my
mind
has
any
one
ever
felt
more
happy
than
i
was
in
the
midst
of
these
generous
friends
the
memory
of
that
happy
hour
will
never
pass
away
from
my
mind
chapter
xxxix
sent
to
succeed
rev
varin
curate
of
opposition
of
that
curate
and
the
surrounding
priest
and
of
desolation
in
good
master
allays
the
tempest
and
bids
the
waves
be
still
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
we
blessed
and
opened
the
seventh
school
of
beauport
from
that
day
all
the
children
were
to
receive
as
good
an
education
as
could
be
given
in
any
country
place
of
canada
those
schools
had
been
raised
on
the
ruins
of
the
seven
taverns
which
had
so
long
spread
ruin
shame
desolation
and
death
over
that
splendid
parish
my
heart
was
filled
with
an
unspeakable
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
marvellous
things
which
by
the
hand
of
god
had
been
wrought
in
such
a
short
time
at
about
two
of
that
day
after
i
had
said
my
vespers
and
was
alone
pacing
the
alleys
of
my
garden
under
the
shade
of
the
old
maple
trees
bordering
the
northern
part
of
that
beautiful
spot
i
was
reviewing
the
struggles
and
the
victories
of
these
last
four
years
it
seemed
that
everything
around
only
the
giant
trees
which
were
protecting
me
from
the
burning
sun
but
even
the
humblest
grasses
and
flowers
of
my
a
voice
to
tell
me
bless
the
lord
for
his
at
my
feet
the
majestic
lawrence
was
rolling
its
deep
waters
beyond
the
old
capital
of
canada
quebec
with
its
massive
citadel
its
proud
towers
its
bristling
cannons
its
numerous
houses
and
steeples
with
their
tin
roofs
reflecting
the
light
of
the
sun
in
myriads
of
rays
formed
such
a
spectacle
of
fairy
beauty
as
no
pen
can
describe
the
fresh
breeze
from
the
river
mingled
with
the
perfume
of
the
thousand
flowers
of
my
parterre
bathed
me
in
an
atmosphere
of
fragrance
never
yet
had
i
enjoyed
life
as
at
that
hour
all
the
sanguine
desires
of
my
heart
and
the
holy
aspirations
of
my
soul
had
been
more
than
realized
peace
harmony
industry
abundance
happiness
religion
and
education
had
come
on
the
heels
of
temperance
to
gladden
and
cheer
the
families
which
god
had
entrusted
to
me
the
former
hard
feelings
of
my
ecclesiastical
superiors
had
been
changed
into
sentiments
and
acts
of
kindness
much
above
my
merits
with
the
most
sincere
feelings
of
gratitude
to
god
i
said
with
the
old
prophet
bless
the
lord
o
my
by
the
great
mercy
of
god
that
parish
of
beauport
which
at
first
had
appeared
to
me
as
a
bottomless
abyss
in
which
i
was
to
perish
had
been
changed
for
me
into
an
earthly
paradise
there
was
only
one
desire
in
my
heart
it
was
that
i
never
should
be
removed
from
it
like
peter
on
mount
tabor
i
wanted
to
pitch
my
tent
in
beauport
to
the
end
of
my
life
but
the
rebuke
which
had
shamed
peter
came
as
quickly
as
lightning
to
show
me
the
folly
and
vanity
of
my
dreams
suddenly
the
carrosse
of
the
bishop
of
quebec
came
in
sight
and
rolled
down
to
the
door
of
the
parsonage
the
the
rev
belisle
alighting
from
it
directed
his
steps
towards
the
garden
where
he
had
seen
me
and
handed
me
the
following
letter
from
the
right
rev
turgeon
coadjutor
of
quebec
my
dear
mons
chiniquy
his
lordship
bishop
signaie
and
i
wish
to
confer
with
you
on
a
most
important
matter
we
have
sent
our
carriage
to
bring
you
to
quebec
please
come
without
the
least
delay
truly
yours
flav
turgeon
one
hour
after
i
was
with
the
two
bishops
my
lord
signaie
said
monseigneur
turgeon
will
tell
you
why
we
have
sent
for
you
in
such
mons
chiniquy
said
bishop
turgeon
is
not
kamouraska
your
birthplace
yes
my
do
you
like
that
place
and
do
you
interest
yourself
much
in
its
welfare
of
course
my
lord
i
like
kamouraska
not
only
because
it
is
my
birthplace
and
the
most
happy
years
of
my
youth
were
spent
in
it
but
also
because
in
my
humble
opinion
the
beauties
of
its
scenery
the
purity
of
its
atmosphere
the
fine
manners
and
proverbial
intelligence
of
its
people
make
it
the
very
gem
of
you
know
rejoined
the
bishop
that
rev
mons
varin
has
been
too
infirm
these
last
years
to
superintend
the
spiritual
interest
of
that
important
place
it
is
impossible
to
continue
putting
a
young
vicar
at
the
head
of
such
a
parish
where
hundreds
of
the
best
families
of
the
aristocracy
of
quebec
and
montreal
resort
every
summer
we
have
too
long
tried
that
experiment
of
young
priests
in
the
midst
of
such
a
people
it
has
been
a
failure
drunkenness
luxury
and
immoralities
of
the
most
degrading
kind
are
eating
up
the
very
life
of
kamouraska
not
less
than
thirty
illegitimate
births
are
known
and
registered
in
different
places
from
kamouraska
these
last
twelve
months
it
is
quite
time
to
stop
that
state
of
affairs
and
you
are
the
only
one
mons
chiniquy
on
whom
we
can
rely
for
that
great
and
difficult
these
words
passed
through
my
soul
as
a
sword
my
lips
quivered
i
felt
as
if
i
were
choking
and
my
tongue
with
difficulty
muttered
my
lord
i
hope
it
is
not
your
intention
to
remove
me
from
my
dear
parish
of
no
mons
chiniquy
we
will
not
make
use
of
our
authority
to
break
the
sacred
and
sweet
ties
which
unite
you
to
the
parish
of
beauport
but
we
will
put
before
your
conscience
the
reasons
we
have
to
wish
you
at
the
head
of
the
great
and
important
parish
of
for
more
than
an
hour
the
two
bishops
made
strong
appeals
to
my
charity
for
the
multitudes
who
were
sunk
into
the
abyss
of
drunkenness
and
every
vice
and
had
no
one
to
save
them
see
how
god
and
men
are
blessing
you
added
the
archbishop
signaie
for
what
you
have
done
in
beauport
will
they
not
bless
you
still
more
if
you
save
that
great
and
splendid
parish
of
kamouraska
as
you
have
saved
beauport
will
not
a
double
crown
be
put
upon
your
forehead
by
your
bishops
your
country
and
your
god
if
you
consent
to
be
the
instrument
of
the
mercies
of
god
towards
the
people
of
your
own
birthplace
and
the
surrounding
country
as
you
have
just
been
for
beauport
and
its
surrounding
parishes
can
you
rest
and
live
in
peace
now
in
beauport
when
you
hear
day
and
night
the
voice
of
the
multitudes
who
cry
come
to
our
help
we
are
perishing
what
will
you
answer
to
god
at
the
last
day
when
he
will
show
you
the
thousands
of
precious
souls
lost
at
kamouraska
because
you
refused
to
go
to
their
rescue
as
monseigneur
turgeon
has
said
we
will
not
make
use
of
our
authority
to
force
you
to
leave
your
present
position
we
hope
that
the
prayers
of
your
bishops
will
be
enough
for
you
we
know
what
a
great
sacrifice
it
will
be
for
you
to
leave
beauport
but
do
not
forget
that
the
greater
the
sacrifice
the
more
precious
will
the
crown
my
bishops
had
spoken
to
me
with
such
kindness
their
paternal
and
friendly
appeals
had
surely
more
power
over
me
than
orders
not
without
many
tears
but
with
a
true
good
will
i
consented
to
give
up
the
prospects
of
peace
and
comfort
which
were
in
store
for
me
in
beauport
to
plunge
myself
again
into
a
future
of
endless
trouble
and
warfare
by
going
to
kamouraska
there
is
no
need
of
saying
that
the
people
of
beauport
did
all
in
their
power
to
induce
the
bishops
to
let
me
remain
among
them
some
time
longer
but
the
sacrifice
had
to
be
made
i
gave
my
farewell
address
on
the
second
sabbath
of
september
in
the
midst
of
indescribable
cries
sobs
and
tears
and
on
the
of
the
same
month
i
was
on
my
way
to
kamouraska
i
had
left
everything
behind
me
at
beauport
even
to
my
books
in
order
to
be
freer
in
that
formidable
conflict
which
seemed
to
be
in
store
for
me
in
my
new
parish
when
i
took
leave
of
the
bishops
of
quebec
they
showed
me
a
letter
just
received
by
them
from
mons
varin
filled
with
the
most
bitter
expressions
of
indignation
on
account
of
the
choice
of
such
a
fanatic
and
as
chiniquy
for
a
place
so
well
known
for
its
peaceful
habits
and
harmony
among
all
the
last
words
of
the
letter
were
as
follows
the
clergy
and
people
of
kamouraska
and
vicinity
consider
the
appointment
of
mons
chiniquy
to
this
parish
as
an
insult
and
we
hope
and
pray
that
your
lordship
will
change
your
mind
on
the
in
showing
me
the
letter
my
lord
signaie
and
turgeon
said
we
fear
that
you
will
have
more
trouble
than
we
expected
with
the
old
curate
and
his
partisans
but
we
commend
you
to
the
grace
of
god
and
the
protection
of
the
virgin
mary
remembering
that
our
saviour
has
said
fear
not
i
have
overcome
the
i
arrived
at
kamouraska
the
of
september
on
one
of
the
finest
days
of
the
year
but
my
heart
was
filled
with
an
unspeakable
desolation
for
all
along
the
way
the
curates
had
told
me
that
the
people
with
their
old
pastor
were
unanimous
in
their
opposition
to
my
going
there
it
was
even
rumored
that
the
doors
of
the
church
would
be
shut
against
me
the
next
sunday
to
this
bad
news
were
added
two
very
strange
facts
my
brother
achilles
who
was
living
at
michel
was
to
drive
me
from
that
place
to
roch
des
aulnets
whence
my
other
brother
louis
would
take
me
to
kamouraska
but
we
had
not
traveled
more
than
five
or
six
miles
when
the
wheel
of
the
newly
finished
and
beautifully
painted
buggy
having
struck
a
stone
the
seat
was
broken
into
fragments
and
we
both
fell
to
the
ground
by
chance
as
my
brother
was
blessing
the
man
who
sold
him
that
rig
for
a
new
and
conveyance
a
traveler
going
the
same
way
passed
by
i
asked
him
for
a
place
in
his
caleche
bade
adieu
to
my
brother
and
consoled
him
by
saying
as
you
have
lost
your
fine
buggy
in
my
service
i
will
give
you
a
better
two
days
after
my
second
brother
was
driving
me
to
my
destination
and
when
about
three
or
four
miles
from
kamouraska
his
fine
horse
stepped
on
a
long
nail
which
was
on
the
road
fell
down
and
died
in
the
awful
convulsions
of
tetanus
i
took
leave
of
him
and
consoled
him
also
by
promising
to
give
him
another
horse
another
carriage
took
me
safely
to
the
end
of
my
journey
however
having
to
pass
by
the
church
which
was
about
yards
from
the
parsonage
i
dismissed
my
driver
at
the
door
of
the
sacred
edifice
and
took
my
satchel
in
hand
which
was
my
only
baggage
entered
the
church
and
spent
more
than
an
hour
in
fervent
prayers
or
rather
in
cries
and
tears
i
felt
so
that
i
needed
that
hour
of
rest
and
prayer
the
tears
i
shed
there
relieved
my
burdened
spirit
a
few
steps
from
me
in
the
cemetery
lay
the
sacred
remains
of
my
beloved
mother
whose
angelic
face
and
memory
were
constantly
before
me
facing
me
was
the
altar
where
i
had
made
my
first
communion
at
my
left
was
the
pulpit
which
was
to
be
the
battlefield
where
i
had
to
fight
the
enemies
of
my
god
and
my
people
who
i
had
been
repeatedly
told
were
cursing
and
grinding
their
teeth
at
me
but
the
vision
of
that
old
curate
i
had
soon
to
confront
and
who
had
written
such
an
impudent
letter
against
me
to
the
bishops
and
the
public
opposition
of
the
surrounding
priests
to
my
coming
into
their
midst
were
the
most
discouraging
aspects
of
my
new
position
i
felt
as
if
my
soul
had
been
crushed
my
very
existence
seemed
an
unbearable
burden
my
new
responsibilities
came
so
vividly
before
my
mind
in
that
distressing
hour
that
my
courage
for
a
moment
failed
me
i
reproached
myself
for
the
act
of
folly
in
yielding
to
the
request
of
the
bishops
it
seemed
evident
that
i
had
accepted
a
burden
too
heavy
for
me
to
bear
but
i
prayed
with
all
the
fervor
of
my
soul
to
god
and
to
the
virgin
mary
and
wept
to
my
heart
s
content
there
was
a
marvellous
power
in
the
prayers
and
tears
which
came
from
my
heart
i
felt
as
a
new
man
i
seemed
to
hear
the
trumpet
of
god
calling
me
to
the
battlefield
my
only
business
then
was
to
go
and
fight
relying
on
him
alone
for
victory
i
took
my
traveling
bag
went
out
of
the
church
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
parsonage
which
has
been
burnt
since
it
was
a
splendid
building
eighty
feet
in
length
with
capacious
cellars
it
had
been
built
shortly
after
the
conquest
of
canada
as
a
store
for
contraband
goods
but
after
a
few
years
of
failure
became
the
parsonage
of
the
parish
the
rev
mons
varin
though
infirm
and
sick
had
watched
me
from
his
window
and
felt
bewildered
at
my
entering
the
church
and
remaining
so
long
i
knocked
the
first
door
but
as
nobody
answered
i
opened
it
and
crossed
the
first
large
room
to
knock
at
the
second
door
but
here
also
no
answer
came
except
from
two
furious
little
dogs
i
entered
the
room
fighting
the
dogs
which
bit
me
several
times
i
knocked
at
the
third
and
fourth
doors
with
the
same
one
to
receive
me
i
knew
that
the
next
was
the
old
curate
s
at
my
knocking
an
angry
voice
cried
out
walk
i
entered
made
a
step
toward
the
old
and
infirm
curate
who
was
sitting
in
his
large
arm
chair
as
i
was
about
to
salute
him
he
angrily
said
the
people
of
beauport
have
made
great
efforts
to
keep
you
in
their
midst
but
the
people
of
kamouraska
will
make
as
great
an
effort
to
turn
you
out
of
this
mons
le
cure
i
answered
calmly
god
knoweth
that
i
never
desired
to
leave
beauport
for
this
place
but
i
think
it
is
that
great
and
merciful
god
who
has
brought
me
here
by
the
hand
and
i
hope
he
will
help
me
to
overcome
all
opposition
from
whatever
quarter
it
may
he
replied
angrily
is
it
to
insult
me
that
you
call
me
mons
le
cure
i
am
no
more
the
curate
of
kamouraska
you
are
the
curate
now
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
varin
you
are
still
i
hope
you
will
remain
all
your
life
the
honored
and
beloved
curate
of
kamouraska
the
respect
and
gratitude
i
owe
you
have
caused
me
to
refuse
the
titles
and
honors
which
our
bishop
wanted
to
give
but
then
if
i
am
the
curate
what
are
you
replied
the
old
priest
with
more
calmness
i
am
nothing
but
a
simple
soldier
of
christ
and
a
sower
of
the
good
seed
of
the
gospel
i
answered
when
i
fight
the
common
enemy
in
the
plain
as
joshua
did
you
like
moses
will
stand
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
lift
up
your
hands
to
heaven
send
your
prayers
to
the
and
we
will
gain
the
day
then
both
will
bless
the
god
of
our
salvation
for
the
well
well
this
is
beautiful
grand
and
sublime
said
the
old
priest
with
a
voice
filled
with
friendly
emotions
but
where
is
your
household
furniture
your
library
my
household
furniture
i
answered
is
in
this
little
bag
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
i
do
not
want
any
of
my
books
as
long
as
i
have
the
pleasure
and
honor
to
be
with
the
good
mons
varin
who
will
allow
me
i
am
sure
of
it
to
ransack
his
splendid
library
and
study
his
rare
and
learned
but
what
rooms
do
you
wish
to
occupy
rejoined
the
good
old
curate
as
the
parsonage
is
yours
and
not
mine
i
answered
please
tell
me
where
you
want
me
to
sleep
and
rest
i
will
accept
with
gratitude
any
room
you
will
offer
me
even
if
it
were
in
your
cellar
or
granary
i
do
not
want
to
bother
you
in
any
way
when
i
was
young
a
poor
orphan
in
your
parish
some
twenty
years
ago
were
you
not
a
father
to
me
please
continue
to
look
upon
me
as
your
own
child
for
i
have
always
loved
you
and
considered
you
as
a
father
and
still
do
the
same
were
you
not
my
guide
and
adviser
in
my
first
steps
in
the
ways
of
god
please
continue
to
be
my
friend
and
adviser
to
the
end
of
your
life
my
only
ambition
is
to
be
your
man
and
to
learn
from
your
old
experience
and
your
sincere
piety
how
to
live
and
work
as
a
good
priest
of
jesus
i
had
not
finished
the
last
sentence
when
the
old
man
burst
into
tears
threw
himself
into
my
arms
pressed
me
to
his
heart
bathed
me
with
his
tears
and
said
with
a
voice
by
his
sobs
dear
chiniquy
forgive
me
the
evil
things
i
have
written
and
said
about
you
you
are
welcome
in
my
parsonage
and
i
bless
god
to
have
sent
me
such
a
young
friend
who
will
help
me
to
carry
the
burden
of
my
old
i
then
handed
him
the
bishop
s
letter
which
had
confirmed
all
i
had
said
about
my
mission
of
peace
towards
him
from
that
day
to
his
death
which
occurred
six
months
after
i
never
had
a
more
sincere
friend
than
varin
i
thanked
god
who
had
enabled
me
at
once
not
only
to
disarm
the
chief
of
my
opponents
but
to
transform
him
into
my
most
sincere
and
devoted
friend
my
hope
was
that
the
people
would
soon
follow
their
chief
and
be
reconciled
to
me
but
i
did
not
expect
that
this
would
be
so
soon
and
from
such
an
unforeseen
and
unexpected
cause
the
principal
reason
the
people
had
to
oppose
my
coming
to
kamouraska
was
that
i
was
the
nephew
of
the
hon
amable
dionne
who
had
made
a
colossal
fortune
at
their
expense
the
rev
varin
who
was
always
in
his
debt
was
also
forced
by
the
circumstances
to
buy
everything
both
for
himself
and
the
church
from
him
and
had
to
pay
without
a
murmur
the
most
exorbitant
prices
for
everything
in
that
way
the
church
and
the
curate
though
they
had
very
large
revenues
had
never
enough
to
clear
their
accounts
when
the
people
heard
that
the
nephew
of
mons
dionne
was
their
curate
they
said
to
each
other
now
our
poor
church
is
forever
ruined
for
the
nephew
will
still
more
than
the
curate
favor
his
uncle
and
the
uncle
will
be
less
scrupulous
than
ever
in
asking
most
unreasonable
prices
for
his
they
felt
they
had
more
than
fallen
from
charybdis
into
scylla
the
very
next
day
after
my
arrival
the
beadle
told
me
that
the
church
needed
a
few
yards
of
cotton
for
some
repairs
and
asked
me
if
he
would
not
go
as
usual
to
dionne
s
store
i
told
him
to
go
there
first
ask
the
price
of
that
article
and
then
go
to
the
other
stores
ordering
him
to
buy
at
the
cheapest
one
thirty
cents
was
asked
at
dionne
s
and
only
fifteen
cents
at
pierre
s
of
course
we
bought
at
the
latter
s
store
the
day
was
not
over
before
this
apparently
insignificant
fact
was
known
all
over
the
parish
and
was
taking
the
most
extraordinary
and
unforeseen
proportions
farmers
would
meet
with
their
neighbors
and
congratulate
themselves
that
at
last
the
yoke
imposed
upon
them
by
the
old
curate
and
dionne
was
broken
that
the
taxes
they
had
to
pay
the
store
were
at
an
end
with
the
monopoly
which
had
cost
them
so
much
money
many
came
to
pierre
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
that
their
new
curate
had
at
once
freed
them
from
what
they
considered
the
long
and
ignominious
bondage
against
which
they
so
often
but
so
vainly
protested
for
the
rest
of
the
week
this
was
the
only
subject
of
conversation
they
congratulated
themselves
that
they
had
at
last
a
priest
with
such
an
independent
and
honest
mind
that
he
would
not
do
them
any
injustice
even
to
please
a
relative
in
whose
house
he
had
spent
the
years
of
his
childhood
this
simple
act
of
fair
play
towards
that
people
won
over
their
affection
only
one
little
dark
spot
remained
in
their
minds
against
me
they
had
been
told
that
the
only
subject
on
which
i
could
preach
was
rum
whiskey
and
drunkenness
and
it
seemed
to
them
exceedingly
tedious
to
hear
nothing
else
from
the
curate
particularly
when
they
were
more
than
ever
determined
to
continue
drinking
their
social
glasses
of
brandy
rum
and
wine
there
was
an
immense
crowd
at
church
the
next
sunday
my
text
was
as
the
father
has
loved
me
so
have
i
loved
showing
them
how
jesus
had
proved
that
he
was
their
friend
but
their
sentiments
of
piety
and
pleasure
at
what
they
had
heard
were
nothing
compared
to
their
surprise
when
they
saw
that
i
had
preached
nearly
an
hour
without
saying
a
word
on
whiskey
rum
or
beer
people
are
often
compared
to
the
waters
of
the
sea
in
the
holy
scriptures
when
you
see
the
roaring
waves
dashing
on
that
rock
as
if
they
wanted
to
demolish
it
do
not
fear
that
this
fury
will
last
long
the
very
next
day
if
the
wind
has
changed
the
same
waters
will
leave
that
rock
alone
to
spend
their
fury
on
the
opposite
rock
so
it
was
in
kamouraska
they
were
full
of
indignation
and
wrath
when
i
set
my
feet
in
their
midst
but
a
few
days
later
those
very
men
would
have
given
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
to
protect
me
the
dear
saviour
had
evidently
seen
the
threatening
storm
which
was
to
destroy
his
poor
unprofitable
servant
he
had
heard
the
roaring
waves
which
were
dashing
against
me
so
he
came
down
and
bid
the
storm
be
still
and
the
waves
be
calm
chapter
xl
organization
of
temperance
societies
in
kamouraska
and
surrounding
girl
in
the
garb
of
a
man
in
the
service
of
the
curates
of
quebec
and
by
the
scandals
seen
up
my
parish
of
kamouraska
to
join
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
of
two
days
after
my
arrival
at
kamouraska
i
received
a
letter
from
the
surrounding
priests
at
the
head
of
whom
was
the
grand
vicar
mailloux
expressing
the
hope
that
i
would
not
try
to
form
any
temperance
society
in
my
new
parish
as
i
had
done
in
beauport
for
the
good
reasons
they
said
that
drunkenness
was
not
prevailing
in
that
part
of
canada
as
it
was
in
the
city
of
quebec
i
answered
them
politely
that
so
long
as
i
should
be
at
the
head
of
this
new
parish
i
would
try
as
i
had
ever
done
to
mind
my
own
business
and
i
hoped
that
my
neighboring
friends
would
do
the
same
not
long
after
i
saw
that
the
curates
felt
ashamed
of
their
vain
attempt
to
intimidate
me
the
next
sabbath
the
crowd
was
greater
than
at
the
first
having
heard
that
the
merchants
were
to
start
the
next
day
with
their
schooners
to
buy
their
winter
provisions
of
rum
i
said
in
a
very
solemn
way
before
my
sermon
my
friends
i
know
that
the
merchants
leave
for
quebec
to
purchase
their
rum
let
me
advise
them
as
their
best
friend
not
to
buy
any
and
as
the
ambassador
of
christ
i
forbid
them
to
bring
a
single
drop
of
those
poisonous
drinks
here
it
will
surely
be
their
ruin
if
they
pay
no
attention
to
this
friendly
advice
for
they
will
not
sell
a
single
drop
of
it
after
next
sabbath
that
day
i
will
show
to
the
intelligent
people
of
this
parish
that
rum
and
all
the
other
drugs
sold
here
under
the
name
of
brandy
wine
and
beer
are
nothing
else
than
disgusting
deadly
and
cursed
i
then
preached
on
the
words
of
our
saviour
be
always
ready
for
ye
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
when
the
son
of
man
though
the
people
seemed
much
pleased
and
impressed
by
that
second
sermon
they
felt
exceedingly
irritated
at
my
few
warning
words
to
the
merchants
when
the
service
was
over
they
all
rallied
around
the
merchants
to
tell
them
not
to
mind
what
they
had
heard
if
our
young
curate
said
they
thinks
he
will
lead
us
by
the
nose
as
he
has
done
with
the
drunkards
of
beauport
he
will
soon
see
his
mistake
instead
of
one
hundred
tons
as
you
brought
last
fall
bring
us
two
hundred
this
year
we
will
drink
them
to
his
health
we
have
a
good
crop
and
we
want
to
spend
a
jolly
it
is
probable
that
the
church
of
kamouraska
had
never
seen
within
its
walls
such
a
crowd
as
on
the
second
sabbath
of
october
it
was
literally
crammed
curiosity
had
attracted
the
people
who
not
less
eager
to
hear
my
first
grand
sermon
against
rum
than
to
see
the
failure
they
expected
and
wished
of
my
first
efforts
to
form
a
temperance
society
long
before
the
public
service
at
the
door
of
the
church
as
well
as
during
the
whole
preceding
week
the
people
had
pledged
themselves
never
to
give
up
their
strong
drink
and
never
to
join
the
temperance
society
but
what
are
the
resolutions
of
man
against
god
is
he
not
their
master
the
half
of
that
first
sermon
on
temperance
was
not
heard
when
that
whole
multitude
had
forgotten
their
public
promises
the
hearts
were
not
only
were
melted
and
changed
by
god
who
wanted
to
show
once
more
that
his
works
of
mercy
were
above
all
the
works
of
his
hands
from
the
very
first
day
of
my
arrival
in
kamouraska
i
had
made
a
serious
and
exact
inquiry
about
the
untold
miseries
brought
upon
the
people
by
intoxicating
drinks
i
had
found
that
during
the
last
twenty
years
twelve
men
had
been
drowned
and
eight
had
been
frozen
to
death
who
had
left
twenty
widows
and
sixty
orphans
in
the
most
distressing
poverty
sixty
farmers
had
lost
their
lands
and
had
been
obliged
to
emigrate
to
other
places
where
they
were
suffering
all
the
pangs
of
poverty
from
the
drunkenness
of
their
parents
several
other
families
had
their
properties
mortgaged
for
their
whole
value
to
the
rum
merchants
and
were
expected
every
day
to
be
turned
out
from
their
inheritances
to
pay
their
rum
bills
seven
mothers
had
died
in
delirium
tremens
one
had
hung
herself
another
drowned
herself
when
drunk
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
had
been
paid
to
the
rum
merchants
during
the
last
fifteen
years
two
hundred
thousand
more
were
due
to
the
storekeeper
of
which
were
for
strong
drink
four
men
had
been
murdered
among
whom
was
their
landlord
achilles
tache
from
their
drunken
habits
when
i
had
recapitulated
all
these
facts
which
were
public
and
undeniable
and
depicted
the
desolation
of
the
ruined
families
composed
of
their
own
brothers
sisters
and
dear
children
when
i
brought
before
their
minds
the
tears
of
the
widows
the
cries
of
the
starving
and
naked
children
the
shame
of
the
families
the
red
hands
of
the
murderers
and
the
mangled
bodies
of
their
victims
the
eternal
cries
of
the
lost
from
drunkenness
the
fathers
and
mothers
whose
children
had
been
destroyed
by
strong
drink
when
i
proved
to
them
that
there
was
not
a
single
one
in
their
midst
who
had
not
suffered
either
in
his
own
person
or
in
that
of
his
father
or
mother
brothers
sisters
or
children
yes
when
i
had
given
them
the
simple
and
awful
story
of
the
crimes
committed
in
their
midst
the
ruin
and
deaths
the
misery
of
thousands
of
precious
souls
for
whom
christ
died
in
vain
the
church
was
filled
with
such
sobs
and
cries
that
i
often
could
not
be
heard
many
times
my
voice
was
drowned
by
the
indescribable
confusion
and
lamentation
of
that
whole
multitude
unable
to
contain
myself
several
times
i
stopped
and
mingled
my
sobs
and
cries
with
those
of
my
people
when
the
sermon
which
lasted
two
hours
was
finished
i
asked
all
those
who
were
determined
to
help
me
in
stopping
the
ravages
of
intoxicating
drinks
in
drying
the
tears
which
they
caused
to
flow
and
saving
the
precious
souls
they
were
destroying
to
come
forward
and
take
the
public
pledge
of
temperance
by
kissing
a
crucifix
which
i
held
in
my
hand
thirteen
hundred
and
ten
came
not
fifty
of
the
people
had
refused
to
enroll
themselves
under
the
blessed
and
glorious
banners
of
temperance
and
these
few
recalcitrants
came
forward
with
a
very
few
exceptions
the
next
time
i
spoke
on
the
subject
the
very
same
day
the
wives
of
the
merchants
sent
despatches
to
their
husbands
in
quebec
to
tell
them
what
had
been
done
and
not
a
single
barrel
of
intoxicating
drinks
was
brought
by
them
the
generous
example
of
the
admirable
people
of
kamouraska
spoke
with
an
irresistible
eloquence
to
the
other
parishes
of
that
district
and
before
long
the
blessed
banners
of
temperance
floated
over
all
the
populations
of
pascal
andrew
isle
verte
cacouna
riviere
du
loup

matane
anne
roch
madawaska
benoit
luce
on
the
south
side
of
the
lawrence
and
the
eboulements
la
malbaye
and
the
other
parishes
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
the
people
kept
their
pledge
with
such
fidelity
that
the
trade
in
rum
was
literally
killed
in
that
part
of
canada
as
it
had
been
in
beauport
and
its
vicinity
the
blessed
fruits
of
this
reform
were
soon
felt
and
seen
everywhere
in
the
public
prosperity
and
the
spread
of
education
kamouraska
which
was
owing
to
the
merchants
in
had
not
only
paid
its
interest
but
had
reduced
its
debt
to
only
when
i
left
it
to
go
to
montreal
in
god
only
knows
my
joy
at
these
admirable
manifestations
of
his
mercies
toward
my
country
however
the
joys
of
man
are
never
without
their
mixture
of
sadness
in
the
good
providence
of
god
being
invited
by
all
the
curates
to
establish
temperance
societies
among
their
people
i
had
the
sad
opportunity
as
no
priest
ever
had
in
canada
to
know
the
secret
and
public
scandals
of
each
parish
when
i
went
to
the
eboulements
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
invited
by
the
rev
noel
toussignant
i
learned
from
the
very
lips
of
that
young
priest
and
the
tetreau
the
history
of
the
most
shameful
scandals
in
a
young
priest
of
quebec
called
derome
had
fallen
in
love
with
one
of
his
young
female
penitents
of
vercheres
where
he
had
preached
a
few
days
and
he
had
persuaded
her
to
follow
him
to
the
parsonage
of
quebec
the
better
to
conceal
their
iniquity
from
the
public
he
persuaded
his
victim
to
dress
herself
as
a
young
man
and
throw
her
dress
into
the
river
to
make
her
parents
and
the
whole
parish
believe
that
she
was
drowned
i
had
seen
her
many
times
at
the
parsonage
of
quebec
under
the
name
of
joseph
and
had
much
admired
her
refined
manners
though
more
than
once
i
was
very
much
inclined
to
think
that
the
smart
joseph
was
no
one
else
than
a
lost
girl
but
the
respect
i
had
for
the
curate
of
quebec
who
was
the
coadjutor
of
the
bishop
and
his
young
vicars
caused
me
to
reject
those
suspicions
as
unfounded
however
many
even
among
the
first
citizens
of
the
city
had
the
same
suspicions
and
they
pressed
me
to
go
to
the
coadjutor
and
warn
him
but
i
refused
and
told
those
gentlemen
to
do
that
delicate
work
themselves
and
they
did
it
the
position
of
that
high
dignitary
and
his
vicar
was
not
then
a
very
agreeable
one
their
bark
had
evidently
drifted
into
dangerous
waters
to
keep
joseph
among
themselves
was
impossible
after
the
friendly
advice
from
such
high
quarters
and
to
dismiss
him
was
not
less
dangerous
he
knew
too
well
how
the
curate
of
quebec
with
his
vicars
were
keeping
their
vows
of
celibacy
to
dismiss
him
without
danger
to
themselves
a
single
word
from
his
lips
would
destroy
them
happily
for
them
clement
then
curate
of
the
eboulements
was
in
search
of
such
a
servant
and
took
him
to
his
parsonage
after
persuading
the
to
give
joseph
a
large
sum
of
money
to
seal
his
lips
things
went
on
pretty
smoothly
between
joseph
and
the
priest
for
several
years
till
some
suspicions
arose
in
the
minds
of
the
people
of
the
parish
who
told
the
curate
that
it
would
be
safer
and
more
honorable
for
him
to
get
rid
of
his
servant
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
those
suspicions
and
to
retain
him
in
the
parsonage
the
curate
persuaded
him
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
poor
neighbor
the
three
bans
were
published
and
the
two
girls
were
duly
married
by
the
curate
who
continued
his
criminal
intimacies
in
the
hope
that
no
one
would
trouble
him
any
more
on
that
subject
but
not
long
after
he
was
removed
to
la
petite
riviere
and
in
the
rev
tetreau
was
appointed
curate
of
the
eboulements
this
new
priest
knowing
nothing
of
the
abominations
which
his
predecessor
had
practiced
continued
to
employ
joseph
one
day
when
joseph
was
working
at
the
gate
of
the
parsonage
in
the
presence
of
several
people
a
stranger
came
and
asked
him
if
tetreau
was
at
home
yes
sir
curate
is
at
home
answered
joseph
but
as
you
seem
a
stranger
to
the
place
would
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
from
what
parish
you
come
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
parish
answered
the
stranger
i
come
from
at
the
word
vercheres
joseph
turned
so
pale
that
the
stranger
was
puzzled
he
looked
carefully
at
him
and
exclaimed
oh
my
god
what
do
i
see
here
genevieve
genevieve
over
whom
we
have
mourned
so
long
as
drowned
here
you
are
disguised
as
a
man
dear
uncle
it
was
her
uncle
for
god
s
sake
not
a
word
more
here
but
it
was
too
late
the
people
who
were
there
had
heard
the
uncle
and
the
niece
their
long
and
secret
suspicions
were
one
of
their
former
priests
had
kept
a
girl
under
the
disguise
of
a
man
in
his
house
and
to
blind
his
people
more
thoroughly
he
had
married
that
girl
to
another
in
order
to
have
them
both
in
the
house
when
he
pleased
without
awakening
any
suspicion
the
news
went
almost
as
quickly
as
lightning
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
parish
and
spread
all
over
the
country
on
both
sides
of
the
lawrence
i
had
heard
of
that
horror
but
i
could
not
believe
it
however
i
had
to
believe
it
when
on
the
spot
i
heard
from
the
lips
of
the
tetreau
and
the
new
curate
noel
de
toussignant
and
from
the
lips
of
my
landlord
the
honorable
laterriere
the
following
details
which
had
come
to
light
only
a
short
time
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
had
investigated
the
matter
in
the
name
of
public
morality
joseph
was
brought
before
the
magistrates
who
decided
that
a
physician
should
be
charged
to
make
not
a
but
an
inquest
the
honorable
laterriere
who
made
the
inquest
declared
that
joseph
was
a
girl
and
the
bonds
of
marriage
were
legally
dissolved
at
the
same
time
the
curate
tetreau
had
sent
a
dispatch
to
the
right
rev
of
quebec
informing
him
that
the
young
man
whom
he
had
kept
in
his
house
several
years
was
legally
proved
a
girl
a
fact
which
i
need
hardly
state
was
well
known
by
the
bishop
and
his
vicars
they
immediately
sent
a
trustworthy
man
with
to
induce
the
girl
to
leave
the
country
without
delay
lest
she
were
prosecuted
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
she
accepted
the
offer
and
crossed
the
lines
to
the
united
states
with
her
where
she
was
soon
married
and
where
she
still
lives
i
wished
that
this
story
had
never
been
told
me
or
at
least
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
doubt
some
of
its
circumstances
but
there
was
no
help
i
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
in
my
church
of
rome
there
was
such
corruption
from
head
to
foot
which
could
scarcely
be
surpassed
in
sodom
i
remember
what
the
rev
perras
had
told
me
of
the
tears
and
desolation
of
bishop
plessis
when
he
had
discovered
that
all
the
priests
of
canada
with
the
exception
of
three
were
atheists
illustration
cardinal
newman
i
would
not
be
honest
did
i
not
confess
that
the
personal
knowledge
of
that
fact
which
i
learned
in
all
its
scandalous
details
from
the
very
lips
of
unimpeachable
witnesses
saddened
me
and
for
a
time
shook
my
faith
in
my
religion
to
its
foundation
i
felt
secretly
ashamed
to
belong
to
a
body
of
men
so
completely
lost
to
every
sense
of
honesty
as
the
priests
and
bishops
of
canada
i
had
heard
of
many
scandals
before
the
infamies

clergy
but
the
abominations
of
which
joseph
was
the
victim
seemed
to
overstep
the
conceivable
limits
of
infamy
for
the
first
time
i
sincerely
regretted
that
i
was
a
priest
the
priesthood
of
rome
seemed
then
to
me
the
very
fulfillment
of
the
prophecy
of
revelation
about
the
great
prostitute
who
makes
the
nations
drunk
with
the
wines
of
her
prostitutions
auricular
confession
which
i
knew
to
be
the
first
if
not
the
only
cause
of
these
abominations
appeared
to
me
what
it
really
is
a
school
of
perdition
for
the
priest
and
his
female
penitents
the
priest
s
oath
of
celibacy
was
to
my
eyes
in
those
hours
of
distress
but
a
shameful
mask
to
conceal
a
corruption
which
was
unknown
in
the
most
depraved
days
of
old
paganism
new
and
bright
lights
came
then
before
my
mind
which
had
i
followed
them
would
have
guided
me
to
the
truth
of
the
gospel
but
i
was
blind
the
good
master
had
not
yet
touched
my
eyes
with
his
divine
and
hand
i
had
no
idea
that
there
could
be
any
other
church
than
the
church
of
rome
in
which
i
could
be
saved
i
was
however
often
saying
to
myself
how
can
i
hope
to
conquer
on
a
battlefield
where
so
many
as
strong
and
even
much
stronger
than
i
am
have
perished
i
felt
no
longer
at
peace
my
soul
was
filled
with
trouble
and
anxiety
i
not
only
distrusted
myself
but
i
lost
confidence
in
the
rest
of
the
priests
and
bishops
in
fact
i
could
not
see
any
one
in
whom
i
could
trust
though
my
beautiful
and
dear
parish
of
kamouraska
was
more
than
ever
overwhelming
me
with
tokens
of
its
affection
gratitude
and
respect
it
had
lost
its
attraction
for
me
to
whatever
side
i
turned
my
eyes
i
saw
nothing
but
the
most
seducing
examples
of
perversion
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
surrounded
by
numberless
snares
from
which
it
was
impossible
to
escape
i
wished
to
depart
from
this
deceitful
and
lost
world
when
my
soul
was
as
drowned
under
the
waves
of
a
bitter
sea
the
rev
guignes
superior
of
the
monastery
of
the
fathers
of
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
at
longueuil
near
montreal
came
to
pass
a
few
days
with
me
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
i
spoke
to
him
of
that
shameful
scandal
and
did
not
conceal
from
him
that
my
courage
failed
me
when
i
looked
at
the
torrent
of
iniquity
which
was
sweeping
everything
under
our
eyes
with
an
irresistible
force
we
are
here
alone
in
the
presence
of
god
i
said
to
him
i
confess
that
i
feel
an
unspeakable
horror
at
the
moral
ruin
which
i
see
everywhere
in
our
church
my
priesthood
of
which
i
was
so
proud
till
lately
seems
to
me
the
most
ignominious
yoke
when
i
see
it
dragged
in
the
mud
of
the
most
infamous
vices
not
only
by
the
immense
majority
of
the
priests
but
even
by
our
bishops
how
can
i
hope
to
save
myself
when
i
see
so
many
stronger
than
i
am
perishing
all
around
me
the
reverend
superior
with
the
kindness
of
a
father
and
the
gravity
of
an
apostle
answered
me
i
understand
your
fears
perfectly
they
are
legitimate
and
too
like
you
i
am
a
priest
and
like
you
if
not
more
than
you
i
know
the
numberless
and
formidable
dangers
which
surround
the
priest
it
is
because
i
know
them
too
well
that
i
have
not
dared
to
be
a
secular
priest
a
single
day
i
knew
the
humiliating
and
disgraceful
history
of
joseph
and
the
coadjutor
bishop
of
quebec
nay
i
know
many
things
still
more
horrible
and
unspeakable
which
i
have
learned
when
preaching
and
hearing
confessions
in
france
and
in
canada
my
fear
is
that
there
are
not
many
more
undefiled
souls
among
the
priests
than
in
sodom
in
the
days
of
lot
the
fact
is
that
it
is
morally
impossible
for
a
secular
priest
to
keep
his
vows
of
celibacy
except
by
a
miracle
of
the
grace
of
god
our
holy
church
would
be
a
modern
sodom
long
ago
had
not
our
merciful
god
granted
her
the
grace
that
many
of
our
priests
have
always
enrolled
themselves
among
the
armies
of
the
regular
priests
in
the
different
religious
orders
which
are
to
the
church
what
the
ark
was
to
noah
and
his
children
in
the
days
of
the
deluge
only
the
priests
whom
god
calls
in
his
mercy
to
become
members
of
any
of
those
orders
are
safe
for
they
are
under
the
paternal
care
and
surveillance
of
superiors
whose
zeal
and
charity
are
like
a
shield
to
protect
them
their
holy
and
strict
laws
are
like
strong
walls
and
high
towers
which
the
enemy
can
not
he
then
spoke
to
me
with
an
irresistible
eloquence
of
the
peace
of
soul
which
a
regular
priest
enjoys
within
the
walls
of
his
monastery
he
represented
in
the
most
attractive
colors
the
spiritual
and
constant
joys
of
the
heart
which
one
feels
when
living
day
and
night
under
the
eyes
of
a
superior
to
whom
he
has
vowed
a
perfect
submission
he
added
your
providential
work
is
finished
in
the
diocese
of
quebec
the
temperance
societies
are
established
almost
everywhere
we
are
in
need
of
your
long
experience
and
your
profound
studies
on
that
subject
in
the
diocese
of
montreal
it
is
true
that
the
good
bishop
de
nancy
has
done
what
he
could
to
support
that
holy
cause
but
though
he
is
working
with
the
utmost
zeal
he
has
not
studied
that
subject
enough
to
make
a
lasting
impression
on
the
people
come
with
us
we
are
more
than
thirty
priests
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
who
will
be
too
happy
to
second
your
efforts
in
that
noble
work
which
is
too
much
for
one
man
alone
moreover
you
can
not
do
justice
to
your
great
parish
of
kamouraska
and
to
the
temperance
cause
together
you
must
give
up
one
to
consecrate
yourself
to
the
other
take
courage
my
young
friend
offer
to
god
the
sacrifice
of
your
dear
kamouraska
as
you
made
the
sacrifice
of
your
beautiful
beauport
some
years
ago
for
the
good
of
canada
and
in
the
interest
of
the
church
which
calls
you
to
its
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
oppose
no
reasonable
argument
to
these
considerations
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
made
the
sacrifice
of
my
beautiful
and
precious
kamouraska
the
last
sabbath
of
september
in
the
midst
of
tears
and
desolation
which
no
words
can
depict
i
gave
my
farewell
address
to
the
so
dear
and
intelligent
people
of
kamouraska
to
go
to
longueuil
and
become
a
novice
of
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
chapter
xli
perversion
of
newman
to
the
church
of
rome
in
the
light
of
his
own
explanations
common
sense
and
the
word
of
god
the
year
will
be
long
remembered
in
the
church
of
rome
for
the
submission
of
newman
to
her
authority
this
was
considered
by
many
roman
catholics
as
one
of
the
greatest
triumphs
ever
gained
by
their
church
against
protestantism
but
some
of
us
more
acquainted
with
the
daily
contradictions
and
tergiversations
of
the
oxford
divine
could
not
associate
ourselves
in
the
public
rejoicings
of
our
church
from
almost
the
very
beginning
of
his
public
life
newman
as
well
as
pusey
appeared
to
many
of
us
as
cowards
and
traitors
in
the
protestant
camp
whose
object
was
to
betray
the
church
which
was
feeding
them
and
which
they
were
sworn
to
defend
they
both
seemed
to
us
to
be
skillful
but
dishonest
conspirators
newman
caught
in
the
very
act
of
that
conspiracy
has
boldly
denied
it
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
public
opinion
as
a
traitor
who
though
enrolled
under
the
banners
of
the
church
of
england
was
giving
help
and
comfort
to
its
foe
the
church
of
rome
he
has
published
a
remarkable
book
under
the
title
of
apologia
pro
vita
sua
to
exculpate
himself
i
hold
in
my
hands
the
new
york
edition
of
few
men
will
read
that
book
from
beginning
to
end
and
still
fewer
will
understand
it
at
its
first
reading
the
art
of
throwing
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
is
brought
to
perfection
in
that
work
i
have
read
many
books
in
my
long
life
but
i
have
never
met
with
anything
like
the
jesuit
ability
shown
by
newman
in
giving
a
color
of
truth
to
the
most
palpable
errors
and
falsehoods
i
have
had
to
read
it
at
least
four
times
with
the
utmost
attention
before
being
sure
of
having
unlocked
all
its
dark
corners
and
sophistries
that
we
may
be
perfectly
fair
towards
newman
let
us
forget
what
his
adversaries
have
written
against
him
and
let
us
hear
only
what
he
says
in
his
own
defence
here
it
is
i
dare
say
that
his
most
bitter
enemies
could
never
have
been
able
to
write
a
book
so
damaging
against
him
as
this
one
which
he
has
given
us
for
his
apology
let
me
tell
the
reader
at
once
that
i
with
many
other
priests
of
rome
felt
at
first
an
unspeakable
joy
at
the
reading
of
many
of
the
tracts
for
the
it
is
true
that
we
keenly
felt
the
blows
newman
was
giving
us
now
and
then
but
we
were
soon
consoled
by
the
more
deadly
blows
which
he
was
striking
at
his
own
church
of
england
besides
that
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
more
he
was
advancing
in
his
controversial
work
the
nearer
he
was
coming
to
us
we
were
not
long
without
saying
to
each
other
dr
newman
is
evidently
though
secretly
for
us
he
is
a
roman
catholic
at
heart
and
will
soon
join
us
it
is
only
from
want
of
moral
courage
and
honesty
that
he
remains
a
but
from
the
very
beginning
there
was
a
cloud
in
my
mind
and
in
the
minds
of
many
other
of
my
about
him
his
contradictions
were
so
numerous
his
sudden
transitions
from
one
side
to
the
other
extreme
when
speaking
of
romanism
and
anglicanism
his
eulogiums
of
our
church
and
his
abuses
of
it
the
very
next
day
his
expressions
of
love
and
respect
for
his
own
church
in
one
tract
so
suddenly
followed
by
the
condemnation
of
her
dearest
doctrines
and
practices
in
the
next
caused
many
others
as
well
as
myself
to
suspect
that
he
had
no
settled
principles
or
faith
in
any
religion
what
was
my
surprise
when
reading
this
strange
book
i
found
that
my
suspicions
were
too
well
founded
that
newman
was
nothing
else
than
one
of
those
who
had
no
real
faith
in
any
of
the
sacred
dogmas
he
was
preaching
and
on
which
he
was
writing
so
eloquently
what
was
my
astonishment
when
in
i
read
in
his
own
book
the
confession
made
by
that
unfortunate
man
that
he
was
nothing
else
but
a
giant
weathercock
when
the
whole
people
of
england
were
looking
upon
him
as
one
of
the
most
sincere
and
learned
ministers
of
the
gospel
here
is
his
own
confession
pages
speaking
of
the
years
he
had
spent
in
the
episcopal
church
as
a
minister
he
says
alas
it
was
my
portion
for
whole
years
to
remain
without
any
satisfactory
basis
for
my
religious
profession
in
a
state
of
moral
sickness
neither
able
to
acquiesce
in
anglicanism
nor
able
to
go
to
rome
this
is
cardinal
newman
painted
by
himself
he
tells
us
how
he
was
when
an
episcopalian
minister
by
feeling
that
his
religion
had
no
basis
no
foundation
what
is
a
preacher
of
religion
who
feels
that
he
has
no
basis
no
foundation
no
reason
to
believe
in
that
religion
is
he
not
that
blind
man
of
whom
christ
speaks
who
leads
other
blind
men
into
the
ditch
note
it
is
not
rev
charles
kingsley
it
is
not
any
of
the
able
protestant
controversialists
it
is
not
even
the
old
chiniquy
who
says
that
newman
was
nothing
else
but
an
unbeliever
when
the
protestant
people
were
looking
upon
him
as
one
of
their
most
pious
and
sincere
christian
theologians
it
is
newman
himself
who
without
suspecting
it
is
forced
by
the
marvellous
providence
of
god
to
reveal
that
deplorable
fact
in
his
apologia
pro
vita
now
what
was
the
opinion
entertained
by
him
of
the
high
and
low
sections
of
his
church
here
are
his
very
words
page
as
to
the
high
church
and
the
low
church
i
thought
that
the
one
had
not
much
more
of
a
logical
basis
than
the
other
while
i
had
a
thorough
contempt
for
the
evangelical
but
please
observe
that
when
this
minister
of
the
church
of
england
had
found
with
the
help
of
pusey
that
this
church
had
no
logical
basis
and
that
he
had
a
thorough
contempt
for
the
evangelical
he
kept
a
firm
and
continuous
hold
upon
the
living
which
he
was
enjoying
from
day
to
day
nay
it
is
when
paid
by
his
church
to
preach
her
doctrines
and
fight
her
battles
that
he
set
at
work
to
raise
another
church
of
course
the
new
church
was
to
have
a
firm
basis
on
logic
history
and
the
gospel
the
new
church
was
to
be
worthy
of
the
british
people
it
was
to
be
the
modern
ark
to
save
the
perishing
world
the
reader
will
perhaps
think
i
am
joking
and
that
i
am
caricaturing
newman
no
the
hour
in
which
we
live
is
too
solemn
to
be
spent
in
is
rather
with
tears
and
sobs
that
we
must
approach
the
subject
here
are
the
very
words
of
newman
about
the
new
church
he
wished
to
build
after
demolishing
the
church
of
england
as
established
by
law
he
says
page
i
have
said
enough
on
what
i
consider
to
have
been
the
general
objects
of
the
various
works
which
i
wrote
edited
or
prompted
in
the
years
which
i
am
reviewing
wanted
to
bring
out
in
a
substantive
form
a
living
church
of
england
in
a
position
proper
to
herself
and
founded
on
distinct
principles
as
far
as
paper
could
do
and
as
earnestly
preaching
it
and
influencing
others
toward
it
could
tend
to
make
it
in
fact
living
church
made
of
flesh
and
blood
with
voice
complexion
motion
and
action
and
a
will
of
its
the
italics
are
mine
if
i
had
not
said
that
these
words
were
written
by
newman
would
the
reader
have
suspected
it
what
is
to
be
the
name
of
the
new
church
newman
himself
has
called
it
via
as
the
phrase
indicates
it
was
to
stand
between
the
rival
churches
of
england
and
rome
and
it
was
to
be
built
with
the
materials
taken
as
much
as
possible
from
the
ruins
of
both
the
first
thing
to
be
done
then
was
to
demolish
that
huge
illogical
unscriptural
unchristian
church
restored
by
the
english
reformers
newman
bravely
set
to
work
under
the
eye
and
direction
of
pusey
his
merciless
hammer
was
heard
almost
day
and
night
from
to
striking
alternately
with
hard
blows
now
against
the
church
of
the
pope
whom
he
railed
antichrist
and
then
against
his
own
church
which
he
was
very
soon
to
find
still
more
corrupted
and
defiled
than
its
rival
for
as
he
was
proceeding
in
his
work
of
demolition
he
tells
us
that
he
found
more
clearly
every
day
that
the
materials
and
the
foundations
of
the
church
of
rome
were
exceedingly
better
than
those
of
his
own
he
then
determined
to
give
a
de
to
the
church
of
england
and
strike
such
a
blow
that
her
walls
would
be
forever
pulverized
his
perfidious
tract
xc
aims
at
this
object
nothing
can
surpass
the
ability
and
the
pious
cunning
with
which
newman
tries
to
conceal
his
shameful
conspiracy
in
his
hear
the
and
unmanly
excuses
which
he
gives
for
having
deceived
his
readers
when
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
most
reliable
theologian
of
the
day
in
defence
of
the
doctrine
of
the
church
of
england
in
pages
he
says
how
could
i
ever
hope
to
make
them
believe
in
a
second
theology
when
i
had
cheated
them
in
the
first
with
what
face
could
i
publish
a
new
edition
of
a
dogmatic
creed
and
ask
them
to
receive
it
as
gospel
would
it
not
be
plain
to
them
that
no
certainty
was
to
be
found
anywhere
well
in
my
defence
i
could
make
but
a
lame
apology
however
it
was
the
true
that
i
had
not
read
the
fathers
critically
enough
that
in
such
nice
points
as
those
which
determine
the
angle
of
divergence
between
the
two
churches
i
had
made
considerable
miscalculations
and
how
came
this
about
why
the
fact
was
unpleasant
as
it
was
to
avow
that
i
had
leaned
too
much
upon
the
assertions
of
usher
jeremy
taylor
or
barrow
and
had
been
deceived
by
here
is
a
specimen
of
the
learning
and
honesty
of
the
great
oxford
divine
newman
confesses
that
when
he
was
telling
his
people
st
augustine
says
this
jerome
says
that
he
assured
them
that
gregory
supported
this
doctrine
and
origen
that
it
was
all
false
those
holy
fathers
had
never
taught
such
doctrines
it
was
usher
taylor
and
barrow
who
were
citing
them
and
they
had
deceived
him
is
it
not
a
strange
thing
that
such
a
shrewd
man
as
newman
should
have
so
completely
destroyed
his
own
good
name
in
the
very
book
he
wrote
with
so
much
care
and
ingenuity
to
defend
himself
one
remains
can
hardly
believe
his
own
eyes
at
such
want
of
honesty
in
such
a
man
it
is
evident
that
his
mind
was
troubled
at
the
souvenir
of
such
a
course
of
procedure
but
he
wanted
to
excuse
himself
by
saying
it
was
the
fault
of
usher
taylor
and
barrow
are
we
not
forcibly
brought
to
the
solemn
and
terrible
drama
in
the
garden
of
eden
adam
hoped
to
be
excused
by
saying
the
woman
whom
thou
gavest
to
be
with
me
she
gave
me
the
fruit
of
the
tree
and
i
did
the
woman
said
the
serpent
beguiled
me
and
i
did
but
what
was
the
result
of
those
excuses
we
read
therefore
the
lord
god
sent
him
forth
from
the
garden
of
newman
has
lost
the
precious
inheritance
god
has
given
him
he
has
lost
the
lamp
he
had
received
to
guide
his
steps
and
he
is
now
in
the
dark
dungeon
of
popery
worshipping
as
a
poor
slave
the
wafer
god
of
rome
but
what
has
become
of
that
new
church
or
religion
the
which
has
just
come
out
from
the
sickly
brain
of
the
oxford
professor
let
us
hear
its
sad
and
premature
end
from
newman
himself
let
me
however
premise
that
when
newman
began
his
attacks
against
his
church
he
at
first
so
skillfully
mixed
the
most
eloquent
eulogiums
with
his
criticisms
that
though
many
sincere
christians
were
grieved
few
dared
to
complain
the
names
of
pusey
and
newman
commanded
such
respect
that
few
raised
their
voices
against
the
conspiracy
this
emboldened
them
month
after
month
they
became
unguarded
in
their
denunciations
of
the
church
of
england
and
more
explicit
in
their
support
of
romanism
in
the
meantime
the
church
of
rome
was
reaping
a
rich
harvest
of
perverts
for
many
protestants
were
unsettled
in
their
faith
and
were
going
the
whole
length
of
the
road
to
rome
so
cunningly
indicated
by
the
conspirators
at
last
the
tract
appeared
in
it
fell
as
a
thunderbolt
on
the
church
a
loud
cry
of
indignation
was
raised
all
over
england
against
those
who
had
so
mercilessly
struck
at
the
heart
of
that
church
which
they
had
sworn
to
defend
the
bishops
almost
unanimously
denounced
newman
and
his
romish
tendencies
and
showed
the
absurdity
of
his
now
let
us
hear
him
telling
himself
this
episode
of
his
life
for
i
want
to
be
perfectly
fair
to
newman
it
is
only
from
his
own
words
and
public
acts
that
i
want
the
reader
to
judge
him
here
is
what
he
says
of
himself
after
being
publicly
condemned
i
saw
indeed
clearly
that
my
place
in
the
movement
was
lost
public
confidence
was
at
an
end
my
occupation
was
gone
it
was
simply
an
impossibility
that
i
could
say
anything
henceforth
to
good
effect
when
i
had
been
posted
up
by
the
marshal
on
the
buttery
hatch
of
every
college
of
my
university
after
the
manner
of
discommoned
and
when
in
every
part
of
the
country
and
every
class
of
society
through
every
organ
and
occasion
of
opinion
in
newspapers
in
periodicals
at
meetings
in
pulpits
at
in
in
railway
carriages
i
was
denounced
as
a
traitor
who
had
laid
his
train
and
was
detected
in
the
very
act
of
firing
it
against
the
confidence
in
me
was
lost
but
i
had
already
lost
full
confidence
in
p
let
the
reader
hear
these
words
from
the
very
lips
of
in
me
was
lost
but
i
had
already
lost
full
confidence
in
myself
p
are
these
words
the
indications
of
a
brave
innocent
man
or
are
they
not
the
cry
of
despair
of
a
cowardly
and
guilty
conscience
was
it
not
when
wishart
heard
that
the
pope
and
his
millions
of
slaves
had
condemned
him
to
death
that
he
raised
his
head
as
a
giant
and
showed
that
he
was
more
above
his
accusers
and
his
judges
than
the
heavens
are
above
the
earth
had
he
lost
his
confidence
in
himself
and
in
his
god
when
he
said
i
am
happy
to
suffer
and
die
in
the
cause
of
truth
did
luther
lose
confidence
in
himself
and
in
his
god
when
condemned
by
the
pope
and
all
his
bishops
and
ordered
to
go
before
the
emperor
to
be
condemned
to
death
if
he
would
not
retract
no
it
is
in
those
hours
of
trial
that
he
made
the
world
to
the
sublime
words
of
david
god
is
our
refuge
and
our
strength
a
present
help
in
trouble
therefore
we
will
not
fear
though
the
earth
be
removed
and
though
the
mountains
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
though
the
waters
thereof
roar
and
be
troubled
though
the
mountains
shake
with
the
swelling
but
luther
had
a
good
cause
he
knew
he
felt
that
the
god
of
heaven
was
on
his
side
when
newman
knew
well
that
he
was
deceiving
the
world
after
having
deceived
himself
luther
was
strong
and
fearless
for
the
voice
of
jesus
had
come
through
the
fifteen
centuries
to
tell
him
fear
not
i
am
with
newman
was
weak
trembling
before
the
storm
for
his
conscience
was
reproaching
him
for
his
treachery
and
his
unbelief
did
latimer
falter
and
lose
his
confidence
in
himself
and
in
his
god
when
condemned
by
his
judges
and
tied
to
the
stake
to
be
burnt
no
it
is
then
that
he
uttered
those
immortal
and
sublime
words
master
ridley
be
of
good
comfort
and
play
the
man
we
shall
this
day
light
a
candle
by
god
s
grace
in
england
as
i
trust
shall
never
be
put
out
this
is
the
language
of
men
who
are
fighting
for
christ
and
his
gospel
newman
could
not
use
such
noble
language
when
he
was
betraying
christ
and
his
gospel
now
let
us
hear
from
himself
when
after
having
lost
the
confidence
of
his
church
and
his
country
and
having
also
lost
his
confidence
in
himself
he
saw
a
ghost
and
found
that
the
church
of
rome
was
right
at
page
he
says
my
friend
an
anxiously
religious
man
pointed
out
the
palmary
words
of
augustine
which
were
contained
in
one
of
the
extracts
made
in
the
dublin
and
which
had
escaped
my
observation
securus
judicat
orbis
he
repeated
these
words
again
and
again
and
when
he
was
gone
they
kept
ringing
in
my
ears
the
words
of
augustine
struck
me
with
such
a
power
which
i
never
had
felt
from
any
words
before
to
take
a
familiar
instance
they
were
like
the
turn
again
whittington
of
the
chime
or
to
take
a
more
serious
one
they
are
like
the
tolle
lege
of
the
child
which
converted
augustine
himself
securus
judicat
orbis
terrarum
by
those
great
words
of
the
ancient
father
the
theory
of
the
was
absolutely
pulverized
i
became
excited
at
the
view
thus
opened
upon
me
i
had
seen
the
shadow
of
a
hand
upon
the
wall
he
who
has
seen
a
ghost
can
not
be
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
the
heaven
had
opened
and
closed
again
the
thought
for
the
moment
had
been
the
church
of
rome
will
be
found
right
after
it
would
be
amusing
indeed
if
it
were
not
so
humiliating
to
see
the
with
which
newman
confesses
his
own
aberration
want
of
judgment
and
honesty
in
reference
to
the
pet
scheme
of
his
whole
theological
existence
at
oxford
by
these
words
he
says
the
was
absolutely
pulverized
we
all
know
the
history
of
the
mountain
in
travail
which
gave
birth
to
a
mouse
newman
tells
us
frankly
that
after
ten
years
of
hard
and
painful
travail
he
produced
something
less
than
a
mouse
his
was
pulverized
it
turned
to
be
only
a
handful
of
dust
remember
the
of
his
trumpet
about
his
plan
of
a
new
church
that
new
jerusalem
on
earth
the
church
of
the
future
which
was
to
take
the
place
of
his
rotten
church
of
england
let
me
repeat
to
you
his
very
words
about
that
new
ark
of
salvation
with
which
the
professor
of
oxford
was
to
save
the
world
page
i
wanted
to
bring
out
in
a
substantive
form
a
living
church
of
england
in
a
position
proper
to
herself
and
founded
on
distinct
principles
as
far
as
paper
could
do
it
and
as
earnestly
preaching
it
and
influencing
others
towards
it
could
tend
to
make
it
a
fact
a
living
church
made
of
flesh
and
blood
with
voice
complexion
and
motion
and
action
and
a
will
of
its
now
what
was
the
end
of
that
masterpiece
of
theological
architecture
of
newman
here
is
its
history
given
by
the
great
architect
himself
i
read
the
palmary
words
of
augustine
judicat
orbis
terrarum
by
those
great
words
of
the
ancient
father
the
theory
of
the
was
pulverized
i
became
excited
at
the
view
thus
opened
before
me
i
had
seen
the
shadow
of
a
hand
on
the
wall
he
who
has
seen
a
ghost
can
never
be
as
if
he
had
not
seen
it
the
heavens
had
opened
and
closed
again
the
thought
for
a
moment
was
the
church
of
rome
will
be
found
right
after
have
we
ever
seen
a
man
destroying
himself
more
completely
at
the
very
moment
that
he
tries
to
defend
himself
here
he
does
ingeniously
confess
what
every
one
knew
before
that
his
whole
work
for
the
last
ten
years
was
not
only
a
but
a
supreme
effort
to
deceive
the
was
a
perfect
string
of
infidelity
sophism
and
folly
the
whole
fabric
had
fallen
to
the
ground
at
the
sight
of
a
ghost
to
build
a
grand
structure
in
the
place
of
his
church
which
he
wanted
to
demolish
he
had
thought
it
was
sufficient
to
throw
a
great
deal
of
glittering
sand
with
some
blue
white
and
red
dust
in
the
air
he
tells
us
that
one
sad
hour
came
when
he
heard
five
latin
words
from
augustine
saw
a
his
great
structure
fell
to
the
ground
what
does
this
all
mean
it
simply
means
that
god
almighty
has
dealt
with
newman
as
he
did
with
the
impious
pharaoh
in
the
red
sea
when
he
was
marching
at
the
head
of
his
army
against
the
church
of
old
his
chosen
people
to
destroy
them
newman
was
not
only
marching
with
pusey
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
theologians
to
destroy
the
church
of
god
but
he
was
employing
all
the
resources
of
his
intellect
all
his
false
and
delusive
science
to
raise
an
idolatrous
church
in
its
place
and
when
pharaoh
and
newman
thought
themselves
sure
of
success
the
god
of
heaven
confounded
them
both
the
first
went
down
with
his
army
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
as
a
piece
of
lead
the
second
lost
not
his
life
but
something
infinitely
more
lost
his
reputation
for
intelligence
science
and
integrity
he
lost
the
light
of
the
gospel
and
became
perfectly
blind
after
having
lost
his
place
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
i
have
never
judged
a
man
by
the
hearsay
of
anyone
and
i
would
prefer
to
have
my
tongue
cut
out
than
to
repeat
a
word
of
what
the
adversaries
of
newman
have
said
against
him
but
we
have
the
right
and
i
think
it
is
our
duty
to
hear
and
consider
what
he
says
of
himself
and
to
judge
him
on
his
own
confession
at
page
we
read
these
words
from
his
own
pen
to
a
friend
i
can
not
disguise
from
myself
that
my
preaching
is
not
calculated
to
defend
that
system
of
religion
which
has
been
received
for
three
hundred
years
and
of
which
the
heads
of
houses
are
the
legitimate
maintainers
in
this
place
i
fear
i
must
allow
that
whether
i
will
or
no
i
am
disposing
them
the
young
men
towards
here
newman
declares
in
plain
english
that
he
was
disposing
his
hearers
and
students
at
oxford
to
join
the
church
of
rome
i
ask
it
what
can
we
think
of
a
man
who
is
paid
and
sworn
to
do
a
thing
who
not
only
does
it
not
but
who
does
the
very
contrary
who
would
hesitate
to
call
such
a
man
dishonest
who
would
hesitate
to
say
that
such
a
one
has
no
respect
for
those
who
employ
him
and
no
respect
for
himself
newman
writes
this
whole
book
to
refute
the
public
accusation
that
he
was
a
traitor
that
he
was
preparing
the
people
to
leave
the
church
of
england
and
to
submit
to
the
pope
but
strange
to
say
it
is
in
that
very
book
we
find
the
irrefutable
proof
of
his
shameful
and
ignominious
treachery
in
a
letter
to
russell
president
of
the
roman
catholic
college
of
maynooth
he
wrote
page
roman
catholics
will
find
this
to
be
the
state
of
things
in
time
to
come
whatever
promise
they
may
fancy
there
is
of
a
large
secession
to
their
church
this
man
or
that
may
leave
us
but
there
will
be
no
general
movement
there
is
indeed
an
incipient
movement
of
our
church
towards
yours
and
this
your
leading
men
are
doing
all
they
can
to
frustrate
by
their
unwearied
efforts
at
all
risks
to
carry
off
individuals
when
will
they
know
their
position
and
embrace
a
larger
and
wiser
policy
is
it
not
evident
here
that
god
was
blinding
newman
and
that
he
was
making
him
confess
his
treachery
in
the
very
moment
that
he
was
trying
to
conceal
it
do
we
not
see
clearly
that
he
was
complaining
of
the
unwise
policy
of
the
leaders
of
the
church
of
rome
who
were
retarding
incipient
of
his
church
towards
romanism
for
which
he
was
working
day
and
night
with
pusey
but
had
not
newman
confessed
his
own
treachery
we
have
its
undeniable
proof
in
the
letter
of
pusey
to
the
english
church
union
written
in
speaking
of
newman
and
the
other
tractarians
he
says
an
acute
man
hawkins
provost
of
oriel
said
of
the
tracts
on
their
first
appearance
i
know
they
have
a
forced
we
put
the
leaven
into
the
meal
and
waited
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
our
object
was
to
catholicise
and
this
confession
of
pusey
that
he
wanted
to
catholicise
england
is
fully
confirmed
by
newman
page
where
he
says
i
suspect
it
was
pusey
s
influence
and
example
which
set
me
and
made
me
set
others
on
the
larger
and
more
careful
works
in
defense
of
the
principles
of
the
movement
which
followed
towards
rome
in
a
course
of
nothing
is
more
curious
than
to
hear
from
newman
himself
with
what
skill
he
was
trying
to
conceal
his
perfidious
efforts
in
preparing
that
movement
towards
rome
he
says
on
that
subject
page
i
was
embarrassed
in
consequence
of
my
wish
to
go
as
far
as
possible
in
interpreting
the
articles
in
the
direction
of
roman
dogma
without
disclosing
what
i
was
doing
to
the
parties
whose
doubts
i
was
meeting
who
might
be
thereby
encouraged
to
go
still
farther
than
at
present
they
found
in
themselves
any
call
to
a
straw
fallen
on
the
water
indicates
the
way
the
tide
goes
here
we
have
the
straw
taken
by
newman
himself
and
thrown
by
him
on
the
water
a
thousand
volumes
written
by
the
of
oxford
to
deny
that
he
was
a
conspirator
at
work
to
lead
his
people
to
rome
when
in
the
service
of
the
church
of
england
could
not
destroy
the
evident
proof
of
his
guilt
given
by
himself
in
this
strange
book
if
we
want
to
have
a
proof
of
the
supreme
contempt
newman
had
for
his
readers
and
his
daily
habit
of
deceiving
them
by
sophistries
and
incorrect
assertions
we
have
it
in
the
remarkable
lines
which
i
find
at
page
of
his
speaking
of
his
doctrinal
development
he
says
i
wanted
to
ascertain
what
was
the
limit
of
that
elasticity
in
the
direction
of
roman
dogma
but
next
i
had
a
way
of
inquiry
of
my
own
which
i
state
without
defending
i
instanced
it
afterward
in
my
essay
on
doctrinal
that
work
i
believe
i
have
not
read
since
i
published
it
and
i
doubt
not
at
all
that
i
have
made
many
mistakes
in
it
partly
from
my
ignorance
of
the
details
of
doctrine
as
the
church
of
rome
holds
them
but
partly
from
my
impatience
to
clear
as
large
a
range
for
the
of
doctrinal
development
waiving
the
question
of
historical
as
was
consistent
with
the
strict
apostolicity
and
identity
of
the
catholic
creed
in
like
manner
as
regards
the
articles
my
method
of
inquiry
was
to
leap
medias
newman
is
the
author
of
two
new
systems
of
theology
and
from
his
own
confession
the
two
systems
are
a
compendium
of
error
absurdities
and
folly
his
was
pulverized
by
the
vision
of
a
ghost
when
he
heard
the
four
words
of
augustine
judicat
orbis
the
second
known
under
the
name
of
doctrinal
development
is
from
his
own
confession
full
of
errors
on
account
of
his
ignorance
of
the
subject
on
which
he
was
writing
and
his
own
impatience
to
support
his
sophisms
newman
is
really
unfortunate
in
his
paternity
he
is
the
father
of
two
children
the
was
called
but
it
had
neither
head
nor
feet
it
was
suffocated
on
the
day
of
its
birth
by
a
the
second
called
doctrinal
development
was
not
the
father
is
so
shocked
with
the
sight
of
the
monster
that
he
publicly
confessed
its
deformities
and
cries
out
mistake
mistake
mistake
pages
pro
vita
the
troubled
conscience
of
newman
has
forced
him
to
confess
page
that
he
was
miserable
from
his
want
of
faith
when
a
minister
of
the
church
of
england
and
a
professor
of
theology
of
oxford
alas
it
was
my
portion
for
whole
years
to
remain
without
any
satisfactory
basis
for
my
religious
profession
at
page
and
he
tells
us
how
miserable
and
anxious
he
was
when
the
voice
of
his
conscience
reproached
him
in
the
position
he
held
in
the
church
of
england
while
leading
her
people
to
rome
at
page
he
confesses
his
unspeakable
confusion
when
he
saw
his
supreme
folly
in
building
up
the
and
heard
it
crash
at
the
appearance
of
a
ghost
at
page
he
acknowledges
how
he
deceived
his
readers
and
deceived
himself
in
his
doctrinal
at
page
he
tells
us
how
he
had
not
only
completely
lost
the
confidence
of
his
country
but
lost
confidence
in
himself
and
it
is
after
this
humiliating
and
shameful
course
of
life
that
he
finds
out
that
the
church
of
rome
is
right
must
we
not
thank
god
for
having
forced
newman
to
tell
us
through
what
dark
and
tortuous
ways
a
protestant
a
disciple
of
the
gospel
a
minister
of
christ
a
professor
of
oxford
fell
into
that
sea
of
sodom
called
romanism
or
papism
a
great
lesson
is
given
us
here
we
see
the
fulfillment
of
christ
s
word
about
those
who
have
received
great
talents
and
have
not
used
them
for
the
good
master
s
honor
and
newman
without
suspecting
it
tells
us
that
it
was
his
course
of
action
towards
that
branch
of
the
church
of
christ
of
which
he
was
a
minister
that
caused
him
to
lose
the
confidence
of
his
country
and
troubled
him
so
much
that
it
caused
him
to
lose
that
which
is
founded
on
our
faith
and
our
union
with
christ
who
is
our
rock
our
only
strength
in
the
hour
of
trial
having
lost
her
sails
her
anchor
and
her
helm
the
poor
ship
was
evidently
doomed
to
become
a
wreck
nothing
could
prevent
her
from
drifting
into
the
engulfing
abyss
of
popery
newman
confesses
that
it
is
only
when
his
guilty
conscience
was
uniting
its
thundering
voice
with
that
of
his
whole
country
to
condemn
him
that
he
said
after
all
the
church
of
rome
is
right
these
are
the
arguments
the
motives
the
light
which
have
led
newman
to
rome
and
it
is
from
himself
that
we
have
it
it
is
a
just
and
avenging
god
who
forces
his
adversary
to
glorify
him
and
say
the
truth
in
spite
of
himself
in
this
pro
vita
no
one
can
read
that
book
written
with
almost
a
superhuman
skill
ability
and
fineness
without
a
feeling
of
unspeakable
sadness
at
the
sight
of
such
bright
talents
such
eloquence
such
extensive
studies
employed
by
the
author
to
deceive
himself
and
deceive
his
readers
for
it
is
evident
on
every
page
that
newman
has
deceived
himself
before
deceiving
his
readers
but
no
one
can
read
that
book
without
feeling
a
sense
of
terror
also
for
he
will
hear
at
every
page
the
thundering
voice
of
the
god
of
the
gospel
because
they
received
not
the
love
of
the
truth
that
they
might
be
saved
god
shall
send
them
strong
delusions
that
they
should
believe
a
thess
what
at
first
most
painfully
puzzles
the
mind
of
the
christian
reader
of
this
book
is
the
horror
which
newman
has
for
the
holy
scriptures
the
unfortunate
man
who
is
perishing
from
hydrophobia
does
not
keep
himself
more
at
a
distance
from
water
than
he
does
from
the
word
of
god
it
seems
incredible
but
it
is
a
fact
that
from
the
first
page
of
the
history
of
his
religious
opinions
to
page
where
he
joins
the
church
of
rome
we
have
not
a
single
line
to
tell
us
that
he
has
gone
to
the
word
of
god
for
light
and
comfort
in
his
search
after
truth
we
see
newman
at
the
feet
of
daniel
wilson
scott
milner
whately
hawkins
blanco
white
william
james
butler
keble
froude
pusey
asking
them
what
to
believe
what
to
do
to
be
saved
but
you
do
not
see
him
a
single
minute
no
not
a
single
minute
at
the
feet
of
the
saviour
asking
him
master
what
must
i
do
to
have
eternal
life
the
sublime
words
of
peter
to
christ
which
are
filling
all
the
echoes
of
heaven
and
earth
these
eighteen
hundred
years
lord
to
whom
shall
we
go
thou
hast
the
words
of
eternal
life
have
never
reached
his
ears
in
the
long
and
gloomy
hours
when
his
soul
was
chilled
and
trembling
in
the
dark
night
of
infidelity
when
his
uncertain
feet
were
tired
by
vainly
going
here
and
there
to
find
the
true
way
he
has
never
heard
christ
telling
him
come
unto
me
i
am
the
way
i
am
the
door
i
am
the
life
in
those
terrible
hours
of
distress
of
which
he
speaks
so
eloquently
when
he
cries
page
alas
i
was
without
any
basis
for
my
religious
profession
in
a
state
of
moral
sickness
neither
able
to
acquiesce
in
anglicanism
nor
able
to
go
to
rome
when
his
lips
were
parched
with
thirst
after
truth
he
never
no
never
went
to
the
fountain
from
which
flow
the
waters
of
eternal
life
one
day
he
goes
to
the
holy
fathers
but
what
will
he
find
there
will
he
see
how
cyprien
sternly
rebuked
the
impudence
of
stephen
bishop
of
rome
who
pretended
to
have
some
jurisdiction
over
the
see
of
carthage
will
he
find
how
gregory
positively
says
that
the
bishop
who
will
pretend
to
be
the
universal
bishop
is
the
forerunner
of
will
he
hear
augustine
declaring
that
when
christ
said
to
peter
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
he
was
speaking
of
himself
as
the
rock
upon
which
the
church
would
stand
no
the
only
thing
which
newman
brings
us
from
the
holy
fathers
is
so
ridiculous
and
so
unbecoming
that
i
am
ashamed
to
have
to
repeat
it
he
tells
us
page
i
have
an
idea
the
mass
of
the
fathers
justin
anthenagoras
irenรฆus
clement
tertullian
origen
ambrose
hold
that
though
satan
fell
from
the
beginning
the
angels
fell
before
the
deluge
falling
in
love
with
the
daughters
of
men
this
has
lately
come
across
me
as
a
remarkable
solution
of
a
notion
i
can
not
help
allow
me
here
to
remind
the
reader
that
though
the
fathers
have
written
many
beautiful
evangelical
pages
some
of
them
have
written
the
greatest
nonsense
and
the
most
absurd
things
which
human
folly
can
imagine
many
of
them
were
born
and
educated
as
pagans
they
had
learned
and
believed
the
history
and
immorality
of
their
they
had
brought
those
notions
with
them
into
the
church
and
they
had
attributed
to
the
angels
of
god
the
passions
and
love
for
women
which
was
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
characters
of
jupiter
mars
cupid
bacchus
etc
and
newman
whose
want
of
accuracy
and
judgment
is
so
often
revealed
and
confessed
by
him
in
this
book
has
not
been
able
to
see
that
those
sayings
of
the
fathers
were
nothing
but
human
aberrations
he
has
accepted
that
as
gospel
truth
and
he
has
been
silly
enough
to
boast
of
it
the
bees
go
to
the
flowers
to
make
their
precious
honey
they
wisely
choose
what
is
more
perfect
pure
and
wholesome
in
the
flowers
to
feed
themselves
newman
does
the
very
contrary
he
goes
to
those
flowers
of
past
ages
the
holy
fathers
and
takes
from
them
what
is
impure
for
his
food
after
this
is
it
a
wonder
that
he
has
so
easily
put
his
lips
to
the
cup
of
the
great
enchantress
who
is
poisoning
the
world
with
the
wine
of
her
prostitution
when
the
reader
has
followed
with
attention
the
history
of
the
religious
opinions
of
newman
in
his
pro
vita
and
he
sees
him
approaching
day
after
day
the
bottomless
abyss
of
folly
corruption
slavery
and
idolatry
of
rome
into
which
he
suddenly
falls
page
he
is
forcibly
reminded
of
the
strange
spectacle
recorded
in
the
eloquent
pages
of
chateaubriand
about
the
niagara
falls
more
than
once
travelers
standing
at
the
foot
of
that
marvel
of
the
marvels
of
the
works
of
god
looking
up
toward
heaven
have
been
struck
by
the
sight
of
a
small
dark
spot
moving
in
large
circles
at
a
great
distance
above
the
fall
gazing
at
that
strange
object
they
soon
remarked
that
in
its
circular
march
in
the
sky
the
small
dark
spot
was
rapidly
growing
larger
as
it
was
coming
down
towards
the
thundering
fall
they
soon
discovered
the
majestic
form
of
one
of
the
giant
eagles
of
america
and
the
eagle
balancing
himself
in
the
air
seemed
to
look
down
on
the
marvellous
fall
as
if
absolutely
taken
with
admiration
at
its
grandeur
and
magnificence
for
some
time
the
giant
of
the
air
remained
above
the
majestic
cataract
describing
his
large
circles
but
when
coming
down
nearer
and
nearer
the
terrific
abyss
he
was
suddenly
dragged
by
an
irresistible
power
into
the
bottomless
abyss
to
disappear
some
time
later
the
body
bruised
and
lifeless
is
seen
floating
on
the
rapid
and
dark
waters
to
be
forever
lost
in
the
bitter
waters
of
the
sea
a
long
distance
below
rome
is
a
fall
it
is
the
name
which
god
himself
has
given
her
there
come
a
falling
away
thess
as
the
giant
eagle
of
america
when
imprudently
coming
too
near
the
mighty
fall
of
niagara
is
often
caught
in
the
irresistible
vortex
which
attracts
it
from
a
long
distance
so
that
eagle
of
oxford
newman
whom
god
had
created
for
better
things
has
imprudently
come
too
near
the
terrific
papal
fall
he
has
been
enchanted
by
its
beauty
its
thousand
bright
rainbows
he
has
taken
for
real
suns
the
fantastic
jets
of
light
which
encircles
its
misty
head
and
conceals
its
dark
and
bottomless
abyss
bewildered
by
the
bewitching
voice
of
the
enchantress
he
has
been
unable
to
save
himself
from
her
perfidious
and
almost
irresistible
attractions
the
eagle
of
oxford
has
been
caught
in
the
whirlpool
of
the
engulphing
powers
of
rome
and
you
see
him
bruised
lifeless
dragged
on
the
dark
waters
of
popery
towards
the
shore
of
a
still
darker
eternity
newman
could
not
make
his
submission
to
rome
without
perjuring
himself
he
swore
that
he
would
never
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
except
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
well
i
challenge
him
here
to
meet
me
and
show
me
that
the
holy
fathers
are
unanimous
on
the
supremacy
of
the
power
of
the
pope
over
the
other
bishops
that
he
is
infallible
that
the
priest
has
the
power
to
make
his
god
with
a
wafer
that
the
virgin
mary
is
the
only
hope
for
sinners
i
challenge
him
to
show
us
that
auricular
confession
is
an
ordinance
of
christ
newman
knows
well
that
those
things
are
impostures
he
has
never
believed
he
never
will
believe
them
the
fact
is
that
newman
confesses
that
he
never
had
any
faith
when
he
was
a
minister
of
the
church
of
england
and
it
is
clear
that
he
is
the
same
since
he
became
a
roman
catholic
in
page
we
read
this
strange
exposition
of
his
faith
we
are
called
upon
not
to
profess
anything
but
to
submit
and
be
silent
which
is
just
the
faith
of
the
mute
animal
which
obeys
the
motion
of
the
bridle
without
any
resistance
or
thought
of
its
own
this
can
not
deny
true
the
only
faith
in
the
church
of
rome
it
is
the
faith
which
leads
directly
to
atheism
or
idiotism
but
christ
gave
us
a
very
different
idea
of
the
faith
he
asks
from
his
disciples
when
he
said
the
time
has
come
when
the
worshippers
shall
worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
john
that
degraded
and
brutal
religion
of
newman
surely
was
not
the
religion
of
paul
when
he
wrote
i
speak
as
to
wise
men
judge
ye
what
i
cor
newman
honestly
tells
us
page
when
speaking
of
the
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
such
devotional
manifestations
in
honor
of
our
lady
had
been
my
great
as
regards
catholicism
i
say
frankly
that
i
do
not
fully
enter
into
them
now
they
are
suitable
for
italy
but
are
not
suitable
for
he
has
only
changed
his
heart
is
what
it
was
formerly
when
a
minister
of
the
church
of
england
he
wanted
then
another
creed
another
church
for
england
so
now
he
finds
that
this
and
that
practice
of
rome
may
do
for
the
italians
but
not
for
the
english
people
was
he
pleased
with
the
promulgation
of
papal
infallibility
no
it
is
a
public
fact
that
one
of
his
most
solemn
actions
a
few
years
since
his
connection
with
the
church
of
rome
was
to
protest
against
the
promulgation
of
that
dogma
more
than
that
he
expressed
his
doubts
about
the
wisdom
and
the
right
of
the
council
to
proclaim
it
let
us
read
his
interesting
letter
to
bishop
rome
ought
to
be
a
name
to
lighten
the
heart
at
all
times
and
a
council
s
proper
office
is
when
some
great
heresy
or
other
evil
impends
to
inspire
hope
and
confidence
in
the
faithful
but
now
we
have
the
greatest
meeting
which
ever
has
been
and
that
at
rome
infusing
into
us
by
the
accredited
organs
of
rome
and
of
its
partisans
such
as
the
the
the
and
the
little
else
than
fear
and
dismay
when
we
are
all
at
rest
and
have
no
doubts
least
practically
not
to
say
the
holy
father
to
be
infallible
suddenly
there
is
thunder
in
the
clear
sky
and
we
are
told
to
prepare
for
something
we
know
not
what
to
try
our
faith
we
know
not
impending
danger
is
to
be
averted
but
a
great
difficulty
is
to
be
created
is
this
the
proper
work
of
an
oe
cumenical
council
as
to
myself
personally
please
god
i
do
not
expect
any
trial
at
all
but
i
can
not
help
suffering
with
the
many
souls
who
are
suffering
and
i
look
with
anxiety
at
the
prospect
of
having
to
defend
decisions
which
may
not
be
difficult
to
my
own
private
judgment
but
may
be
most
difficult
to
maintain
logically
in
the
face
of
historical
facts
what
have
we
done
to
be
treated
as
the
faithful
never
were
treated
before
when
has
a
definition
been
a
luxury
of
devotion
and
not
a
stern
painful
necessity
why
should
an
aggressive
insolent
faction
be
allowed
to
make
the
heart
of
the
just
sad
whom
the
lord
hath
not
made
sorrowful
why
can
not
we
be
let
alone
when
we
have
pursued
peace
and
thought
no
evil
i
assure
you
my
lord
some
of
the
truest
minds
are
driven
one
way
and
another
and
do
not
know
where
to
rest
their
day
determining
to
give
up
all
theology
as
a
bad
job
and
recklessly
to
believe
henceforth
almost
that
the
pope
is
impeccable
at
another
tempted
to
believe
all
the
worst
that
a
book
like
says
others
doubting
about
the
capacity
possessed
by
bishops
drawn
from
corners
of
the
earth
to
judge
what
is
fitting
for
european
society
and
then
again
angry
with
the
holy
see
for
listening
to
the
flattery
of
a
clique
of
jesuits
redemptorists
and
then
again
think
of
the
store
of
pontifical
scandals
in
the
history
of
eighteen
centuries
which
have
partly
been
poured
forth
and
partly
are
still
to
come
what
murphy
inflicted
upon
us
in
one
way
veuillot
is
indirectly
bringing
on
us
in
another
and
then
again
the
blight
which
is
falling
upon
the
multitude
of
anglican
ritualists
who
themselves
least
their
never
become
catholics
but
who
are
leavening
the
various
english
denominations
and
parties
far
beyond
their
own
range
with
principles
and
sentiments
towards
their
ultimate
absorption
into
the
catholic
church
with
these
thoughts
ever
before
me
i
am
continually
asking
myself
whether
i
ought
not
to
make
my
feelings
public
but
all
i
do
is
to
pray
those
early
doctors
of
the
church
whose
intercession
would
decide
the
matter
augustine
ambrose
and
jerome
athanasius
chrysostom
and
basil
to
avert
this
great
calamity
if
it
is
god
s
will
that
the
pope
s
infallibility
be
defined
then
it
is
god
s
will
to
throw
back
the
times
and
movements
of
that
triumph
which
he
has
destined
for
his
kingdom
and
i
shall
feel
i
have
but
to
bow
my
head
to
his
adorable
inscrutable
providence
you
have
not
touched
upon
the
subject
yourself
but
i
think
you
will
allow
me
to
express
to
you
feeling
which
for
the
most
part
i
keep
to

and

these
eloquent
complaints
of
the
new
convert
exceedingly
irritated
pius
ix
and
the
jesuits
at
rome
they
entirely
destroyed
their
confidence
in
him
they
were
too
shrewd
to
ignore
that
he
had
never
been
anything
else
but
a
kind
of
whose
christian
faith
was
without
any
basis
as
he
himself
confessed
they
had
received
him
of
course
with
pleasure
for
he
was
the
very
best
man
in
england
to
unsettle
the
minds
of
the
young
ministers
of
the
church
but
they
had
left
him
alone
in
his
oratory
of
birmingham
where
they
seemed
to
ignore
him
however
when
the
protest
of
the
new
convert
showed
that
his
submission
was
but
a
sham
and
that
he
was
more
protestant
than
ever
they
lashed
him
without
mercy
but
before
we
hear
the
stern
answers
of
the
roman
catholics
to
their
new
recruit
let
us
remember
the
fact
that
when
that
letter
appeared
newman
had
lost
the
memory
of
it
he
boldly
denied
its
paternity
at
first
it
was
only
when
the
proofs
were
publicly
given
that
he
had
written
it
that
he
acknowledged
it
saying
for
his
excuse
that
he
had
forgotten
his
writing
it
now
let
us
hear
the
answer
of
the
the
organ
of
the
pope
to
newman
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
only
temptation
that
makes
you
see
everything
black
if
the
holy
doctors
whom
you
invoke
ambrose
jerome
do
not
decide
the
controversy
in
your
way
it
is
not
as
the
protestant
mall
fancies
because
they
will
not
or
can
not
interpose
but
because
they
agree
with
peter
and
with
the
petition
of
the
majority
would
you
have
us
make
a
procession
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
to
avert
this
scourge
of
the
definition
of
a
verity
the
clergy
of
france
through
their
organ
vol
was
still
more
severe
and
sarcastic
they
had
just
collected
to
help
newman
to
pay
the
enormous
expenses
of
the
suit
for
his
slanders
against
father
achille
which
he
had
lost
newman
as
it
appears
by
the
article
from
the
pen
of
the
celebrated
editor
of
the
had
not
even
had
the
courtesy
to
acknowledge
the
gift
nor
the
exertions
of
those
who
had
collected
that
large
sum
of
money
now
let
us
see
what
they
thought
and
said
in
france
about
the
of
oxford
whom
they
called
the
respectable
speaking
of
the
sent
from
france
veuillot
says
the
respectable
convict
received
it
and
was
pleased
but
he
gave
no
thanks
and
showed
no
mercy
father
newman
ought
to
be
more
careful
in
what
he
says
everything
that
is
comely
demands
it
of
him
but
at
any
rate
if
his
liberal
passion
carries
him
away
till
he
forgets
what
he
owes
to
us
and
to
himself
what
answer
must
one
give
him
but
that
he
had
better
go
on
as
he
set
out
silently
ungrateful
vol
these
public
rebukes
addressed
from
paris
and
rome
by
the
two
most
popular
organs
of
the
church
of
rome
tell
us
the
old
story
the
services
of
traitors
may
be
accepted
but
they
are
never
trusted
father
newman
had
not
the
confidence
of
the
roman
catholics
but
some
one
will
say
has
not
the
dignity
of
cardinal
to
which
he
has
lately
been
raised
proved
that
the
present
pope
has
the
greatest
confidence
in
newman
had
i
not
been
years
a
priest
of
rome
i
would
say
yes
but
i
know
too
much
of
their
tactics
for
that
the
dignity
of
cardinal
has
been
given
to
drs
manning
and
newman
as
the
baits
which
the
fisherman
of
prince
edward
island
throw
into
the
sea
to
attract
the
mackerels
the
pope
with
those
long
scarlet
robes
thrown
over
the
shoulders
of
the
two
renegades
from
the
church
of
england
hopes
to
catch
more
english
mackerels
besides
that
we
all
know
the
remarkable
words
of
paul
and
those
members
of
the
body
which
we
think
to
be
less
honourable
upon
them
we
bestow
more
abundant
honours
and
our
uncomely
parts
have
more
abundant
cor
it
is
on
that
principle
that
the
pope
has
acted
he
knew
well
that
newman
had
played
the
act
of
a
traitor
at
oxford
that
he
had
been
caught
in
the
very
act
of
conspiracy
by
his
bishops
that
he
had
entirely
lost
the
confidence
of
the
english
people
these
public
facts
paralyzed
the
usefulness
of
the
new
convert
he
was
really
a
member
of
the
church
of
rome
but
he
was
one
of
the
most
uncomely
ones
so
much
so
that
the
last
pope
pius
had
left
him
alone
in
a
dark
corner
for
nearly
eighteen
years
leo
xiii
was
more
shrewd
he
felt
that
newman
might
become
one
of
the
most
powerful
agents
of
romanism
in
england
if
he
were
only
covering
his
uncomeliness
with
the
rich
red
cardinal
robe
but
will
the
scarlet
colors
which
now
clothe
newman
make
us
forget
that
he
belongs
to
the
most
absurd
immoral
abject
and
degrading
form
of
idolatry
the
world
has
ever
seen
will
we
forget
that
romanism
these
last
six
centuries
is
nothing
else
than
old
paganism
in
its
most
degrading
forms
coming
back
under
a
christian
name
what
is
the
divinity
which
is
adored
in
those
splendid
temples
of
modern
rome
is
it
anything
else
but
the
old
jupiter
tonans
yes
the
pope
has
stolen
the
old
gods
of
paganism
and
he
has
sacrilegiously
written
the
adorable
name
of
jesus
in
their
faces
that
the
more
deluded
modern
nations
may
have
less
objection
to
accept
the
worship
of
their
pagan
ancestors
they
adore
a
christ
in
the
church
of
rome
they
sing
beautiful
hymns
to
his
honor
they
build
him
magnificent
temples
they
are
exceedingly
devoted
to
make
daily
enormous
sacrifices
to
extend
his
power
and
glory
all
over
the
world
but
what
is
that
christ
it
is
simply
an
idol
of
bread
baked
every
day
by
the
servant
girl
of
the
priest
or
the
neighboring
nuns
i
have
been
years
one
of
the
most
sincere
and
zealous
priests
of
that
christ
i
have
made
him
with
mine
own
hands
and
the
help
of
my
servants
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
have
a
right
to
say
that
i
know
him
perfectly
well
it
is
that
i
may
tell
what
i
know
of
that
christ
that
the
god
of
the
gospel
has
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
granted
me
to
give
my
testimony
before
the
world
hundreds
of
times
i
have
said
to
my
servant
girl
what
newman
and
all
the
priests
of
rome
say
every
day
to
their
own
servants
or
their
nuns
please
make
me
some
wafers
that
i
may
say
mass
and
give
the
communion
to
those
who
want
to
receive
and
the
dutiful
girl
took
some
wheat
flour
mixed
it
with
water
and
put
the
dough
between
these
two
and
engraven
irons
which
she
had
well
heated
before
in
less
time
than
i
can
write
it
the
dough
was
baked
into
wafers
handing
them
to
me
i
brought
them
to
the
altar
and
performed
a
ceremony
which
is
called
the
in
the
very
midst
of
that
mass
i
pronounced
on
the
wafer
five
magic
words
est
enim
corpus
and
had
to
believe
what
newman
and
all
the
priests
of
rome
profess
to
believe
that
there
were
no
more
wafers
no
more
bread
before
me
but
that
what
were
wafers
had
been
turned
into
the
great
eternal
god
who
had
created
the
world
i
had
to
prostrate
myself
and
ask
my
people
to
prostrate
themselves
before
the
god
i
had
just
made
with
five
words
from
my
lips
and
the
people
on
their
knees
bowing
their
heads
and
bringing
their
faces
to
the
dust
adored
god
whom
i
had
just
made
with
the
help
of
these
heated
irons
and
my
servant
girl
now
is
this
not
a
form
of
idolatry
more
degrading
more
insulting
to
the
infinite
majesty
of
god
than
the
worship
of
the
golden
calf
where
is
the
difference
between
the
idolatry
of
aaron
and
the
israelites
adoring
the
golden
calf
in
the
wilderness
and
the
idolatry
of
newman
adoring
the
wafer
in
his
temple
the
only
difference
is
that
aaron
worshipped
a
god
infinitely
more
respectable
and
powerful
in
melted
gold
than
newman
worshipping
his
baked
dough
the
idolatry
of
newman
is
more
degrading
than
the
idolatry
of
the
worshippers
of
the
sun
when
the
persians
adore
the
sun
they
give
their
homage
to
the
greatest
the
most
glorious
being
which
is
before
us
that
magnificent
fiery
orb
millions
of
miles
in
circumference
which
rises
as
a
giant
every
morning
from
behind
the
horizon
to
march
over
the
world
and
pour
everywhere
its
floods
of
heat
light
and
life
can
not
be
contemplated
without
feelings
of
respect
admiration
and
awe
man
must
raise
his
eyes
up
to
see
that
glorious
must
take
the
eagle
s
wings
to
follow
his
giant
strides
throughout
the
myriads
of
worlds
which
are
there
to
speak
to
us
of
the
wisdom
the
power
and
love
of
our
god
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
poor
fallen
blind
men
may
take
that
great
being
for
their
god
would
not
every
one
perish
and
die
if
the
sun
would
forget
to
come
every
day
that
we
may
bathe
and
swim
in
his
ocean
of
light
and
life
then
when
i
see
the
persian
priests
of
the
sun
in
their
magnificent
temple
with
censers
in
their
hands
waiting
for
the
appearance
of
its
first
rays
to
intone
their
melodious
hymns
and
sing
their
sublime
canticles
i
know
their
error
and
i
understand
it
i
was
about
to
say
i
almost
excuse
it
i
feel
an
immense
compassion
for
these
deluded
idolaters
however
i
feel
they
are
raised
above
the
dust
of
the
earth
their
intelligence
their
souls
can
not
but
receive
some
sparks
of
light
and
life
from
the
contemplation
of
that
inexhaustible
focus
of
light
and
life
but
is
not
newman
with
his
roman
catholic
people
a
thousand
times
more
worthy
of
our
compassion
and
our
tears
when
they
are
abjectly
prostrated
before
this
ignoble
adore
it
as
their
saviour
their
creator
their
god
is
it
possible
to
imagine
a
spectacle
more
humiliating
blasphemous
and
sacrilegious
than
a
multitude
of
men
and
women
prostrating
their
faces
to
the
dust
to
adore
a
god
whom
the
rats
and
mice
have
thousands
of
times
dragged
and
eaten
in
their
dark
holes
where
are
the
rays
of
light
and
life
coming
from
that
wafer
instead
of
being
enlarged
and
elevated
at
the
approach
of
this
ridiculous
modern
divinity
is
not
the
human
intelligence
contracted
diminished
paralyzed
chilled
and
struck
with
idiocy
and
death
at
its
feet
can
we
be
surprised
that
the
roman
catholic
nations
are
so
fast
falling
into
the
abyss
of
infidelity
and
atheism
when
they
hear
their
priests
telling
them
that
more
than
times
every
day
this
contemptible
wafer
is
changed
by
them
into
the
great
god
who
has
created
heaven
and
earth
at
the
beginning
and
who
has
saved
this
perishing
world
by
sacrificing
the
body
and
the
blood
which
he
has
taken
as
his
tabernacle
to
show
us
his
eternal
love
come
with
me
and
see
those
multitudes
of
people
with
their
faces
prostrated
in
the
dust
adoring
their
white
elephant
of
siam
oh
what
ignorance
and
superstition
what
blindness
and
folly
you
will
exclaim
to
adore
a
white
elephant
as
god
but
there
is
a
spectacle
more
humiliating
and
more
deplorable
there
is
a
superstition
an
idolatry
below
that
of
the
siamese
it
is
the
idolatry
practiced
by
newman
and
his
millions
of
yes
the
of
the
asiatic
people
is
infinitely
more
respectable
than
the
of
newman
that
elephant
may
be
taken
as
the
symbol
of
strength
magnanimity
patience
etc
there
is
life
motion
in
that
noble
sees
with
his
eyes
he
walks
with
his
feet
let
some
one
attack
him
he
will
protect
his
mighty
trunk
he
will
throw
his
enemy
high
in
the
will
crush
him
under
his
feet
but
look
at
this
modern
divinity
of
rome
it
has
eyes
but
does
not
see
feet
but
does
not
move
a
mouth
but
does
not
speak
there
is
neither
life
nor
strength
in
the
wafer
god
of
rome
but
if
the
fall
of
newman
into
the
bottomless
abyss
of
the
idolatry
of
rome
is
a
deplorable
fact
there
is
another
fact
still
more
deplorable
how
many
fervent
christians
how
many
venerable
ministers
of
christ
everywhere
are
just
now
prostrated
at
the
dear
saviour
s
feet
telling
him
with
tears
didst
thou
not
sow
the
good
gospel
seed
all
over
our
dear
country
through
the
hands
of
our
heroic
and
martyred
fathers
from
whence
then
hath

can
not

from
myself
that
my

is
not
calculated
to
defend
that
system
of

has
been
received
for
three
hundred
years

of
which
the
heads

are
the
legitimate
maintainers
in

place
i
must
allow
that
i
was
disposing
the
minds
of
young
men
towards

obtained
from
the
very
enemy

he
has
sowed

you
will

how
he
went
away

prostrated
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
most
implacable
enemy
of
all
the
rights
and
liberties
of
men
to
call
him
most
holy

he
fell
at
the

very
power

prepared
and
blessed
the
armada
destined
to
cover
his
native
land
england
with
desolation
ruins
tears

blood
and
enchain
those
of

people

would
not

an
outraged
citizen

such
an
infamous
crime

and
the

on
the
first
sabbath
of
november
after
a
retreat
of
eight
days
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
asked
as
a
favor
to
be
received
as
a
novice
of
the
religious
order
of
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
of
longueuil
whose
object
is
to
preach
retreats
revivals
among
the
people
no
child
of
the
church
of
rome
ever
enrolled
himself
with
more
earnestness
and
sincerity
under
the
mysterious
banners
of
her
monastic
armies
than
i
did
that
day
it
is
impossible
to
entertain
more
exalted
views
of
the
beauty
and
holiness
of
the
monastic
life
than
i
had
to
live
among
the
holy
men
who
had
made
the
solemn
vows
of
poverty
obedience
and
charity
seemed
to
me
the
greatest
and
the
most
blessed
privilege
which
my
god
could
grant
on
earth
within
the
walls
of
the
peaceful
monastery
of
longueuil
among
those
holy
men
who
had
long
since
put
an
impassable
barrier
between
themselves
and
that
corrupted
world
from
the
snares
of
which
i
was
just
escaping
my
conviction
was
that
i
should
see
nothing
but
actions
of
the
most
exalted
piety
and
that
the
deadly
weapons
of
the
enemy
could
not
pierce
those
walls
protected
by
the
immaculate
mother
of
god
the
frightful
storms
which
had
covered
with
wrecks
the
roaring
sea
where
i
had
so
often
nearly
perished
could
not
trouble
the
calm
waters
of
the
port
where
my
bark
had
just
entered
every
one
of
the
members
of
the
community
was
to
be
like
an
angel
of
charity
humility
modesty
whose
example
was
to
guide
my
steps
in
the
ways
of
god
my
superior
appeared
to
be
less
a
superior
than
a
father
whose
protecting
care
by
day
and
night
would
be
a
shield
over
me
noah
in
the
ark
safe
from
the
raging
waves
which
were
destroying
the
world
did
not
feel
more
grateful
to
god
than
i
was
when
once
in
this
holy
solitude
the
vow
of
perfect
poverty
was
to
save
me
for
ever
from
the
cares
of
the
world
having
hereafter
no
right
to
possess
a
cent
the
world
would
become
to
me
a
paradise
where
food
clothing
and
lodging
would
come
without
anxiety
or
care
my
father
superior
would
supply
all
these
things
without
any
other
condition
on
my
part
than
to
love
and
obey
a
man
of
god
whose
whole
life
was
to
be
spent
in
guiding
my
steps
in
the
ways
of
the
most
exalted
evangelical
virtues
had
not
that
father
himself
made
a
solemn
vow
to
renounce
not
only
all
the
honors
and
dignities
of
the
church
that
his
whole
mind
and
heart
might
be
devoted
to
my
holiness
on
earth
and
my
salvation
in
heaven
how
easy
to
secure
that
salvation
now
i
had
only
to
look
to
that
father
on
earth
and
obey
him
as
my
father
in
heaven
yes
the
will
of
that
father
was
to
be
for
me
the
will
of
my
god
though
i
might
err
in
obeying
him
my
errors
would
not
be
laid
to
my
charge
to
save
my
soul
i
should
have
only
to
be
like
a
corpse
or
a
stick
in
the
hands
of
my
father
superior
without
any
anxiety
or
any
responsibility
whatever
of
my
own
i
was
to
be
led
to
heaven
as
a
child
in
the
arms
of
his
loving
mother
without
any
fear
thoughts
or
anxiety
of
his
own
with
the
christian
poet
i
could
have
sung
rocks
and
storms
i
ll
fear
no
more
when
on
that
eternal
shore
drop
the
anchor
furl
the
sail
i
am
safe
within
the
but
how
short
were
to
be
these
fine
dreams
of
my
poor
deluded
mind
when
on
my
knees
father
guigues
handed
me
with
great
solemnity
the
latin
books
of
the
rules
of
that
monastic
order
which
is
their
real
gospel
warning
me
that
it
was
a
that
there
were
things
in
it
that
i
ought
not
to
reveal
to
any
one
and
he
made
me
solemnly
promise
that
i
would
never
show
it
to
any
one
outside
of
the
order
when
alone
the
next
morning
in
my
cell
i
thanked
god
and
the
virgin
mary
for
the
favors
of
the
last
day
and
the
thought
came
involuntarily
to
my
mind
have
you
not
a
thousand
times
heard
and
said
that
the
holy
church
of
rome
absolutely
condemns
and
anathematizes
secret
societies
and
do
you
not
belong
to
a
secret
society
how
can
you
reconcile
the
solemn
promise
of
secrecy
you
made
last
night
with
the
anathemas
hurled
by
all
your
popes
against
secret
societies
after
having
in
vain
tried
in
my
mind
to
reconcile
those
two
things
i
happily
remembered
that
i
was
a
corpse
that
i
had
forever
given
up
my
private
my
only
business
now
was
to
obey
does
a
corpse
argue
against
those
who
turn
it
from
side
to
side
is
it
not
in
perfect
peace
whatever
may
be
the
usage
to
which
it
is
exposed
or
to
whatever
place
it
is
dragged
shall
i
lose
the
rich
crown
which
is
before
me
at
my
first
step
in
the
way
of
perfection
i
bade
my
rebellious
intelligence
to
be
still
my
private
judgment
to
be
mute
and
to
distract
my
mind
from
this
first
temptation
i
read
that
book
of
rules
with
the
utmost
attention
i
had
not
gone
through
it
all
before
i
understood
why
it
was
kept
from
the
eyes
of
the
curates
and
other
secular
priests
to
my
unspeakable
amazement
i
found
that
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
it
speaks
with
the
most
profound
contempt
for
them
all
i
said
to
myself
what
would
be
the
indignation
of
the
curates
if
they
should
suspect
that
these
strangers
from
france
have
such
a
bad
opinion
of
them
all
would
the
good
canadian
curates
receive
them
as
angels
from
heaven
and
raise
them
so
high
in
the
esteem
of
the
people
if
they
knew
that
the
first
thing
an
oblate
has
to
learn
is
that
the
secular
priest
is
steeped
in
immorality
ignorance
worldliness
laziness
gluttony
etc
that
he
is
the
disgrace
of
the
church
which
would
speedily
be
destroyed
was
she
not
providentially
sustained
and
kept
in
the
ways
of
god
by
the
holy
monastic
men
whom
she
nurses
as
her
only
hope
clear
as
the
light
of
the
sun
on
a
bright
day
the
whole
fabric
of
the
order
of
the
oblates
presented
itself
to
my
mind
as
the
most
perfect
system
of
pharisaism
the
world
had
ever
seen
the
oblate
who
studies
his
book
of
rules
his
only
gospel
must
have
his
mind
filled
with
the
idea
of
his
superior
holiness
not
only
over
the
poor
sinful
secular
priest
but
over
everyone
else
the
oblate
alone
is
christian
holy
and
saved
the
rest
of
the
world
is
lost
the
oblate
alone
is
the
salt
of
the
earth
the
light
of
the
world
i
said
to
myself
is
it
to
attain
this
pharisaical
perfection
that
i
have
left
my
beautiful
and
dear
parish
of
kamouraska
and
given
up
the
honorable
position
which
my
god
had
given
me
in
my
country
however
after
some
time
spent
in
these
sad
and
despondent
reflections
i
again
felt
angry
with
myself
i
quickly
directed
my
mind
to
the
frightful
unsuspected
and
numberless
scandals
i
had
known
in
almost
every
parish
i
had
visited
i
remembered
the
drunkenness
of
that
curate
the
impurities
of
this
the
ignorance
of
another
the
worldliness
and
absolute
want
of
faith
of
others
and
concluded
that
after
all
the
oblates
were
not
far
from
the
truth
in
their
bad
opinions
of
the
secular
clergy
i
ended
my
sad
reflections
by
saying
to
myself
after
all
if
the
oblates
live
a
life
of
holiness
as
i
expect
to
find
here
is
it
a
crime
that
they
should
see
feel
and
express
among
themselves
the
difference
which
exists
between
a
regular
and
a
secular
clergy
am
i
come
here
to
judge
and
condemn
these
holy
men
no
i
came
here
to
save
myself
by
the
practice
of
the
most
heroic
christian
virtues
the
first
of
which
is
that
i
should
absolutely
and
forever
give
up
my
myself
as
a
corpse
in
the
hand
of
my
with
all
the
fervor
of
my
soul
i
prayed
to
god
and
to
the
virgin
mary
day
and
night
that
week
that
i
might
attain
that
supreme
state
of
perfection
when
i
would
have
no
will
no
judgment
of
my
own
the
days
of
that
first
week
passed
very
quickly
spent
in
prayer
reading
and
meditation
of
the
scriptures
studies
of
ecclesiastical
history
and
ascetical
books
from
five
in
the
morning
till
nine
at
night
the
meals
were
taken
at
the
regular
hours
of
seven
twelve
and
six
o
clock
during
which
with
rare
exceptions
silence
was
kept
and
pious
books
were
read
the
quality
of
the
food
was
good
but
at
first
before
they
got
a
female
cook
to
preside
over
the
kitchen
everything
was
so
unclean
that
i
had
to
shut
my
eyes
at
meals
not
to
see
what
i
was
eating
i
should
have
complained
had
not
my
lips
been
sealed
by
that
strange
monastic
vow
of
perfection
that
every
religious
man
is
a
corpse
what
does
a
corpse
care
about
the
cleanliness
or
uncleanliness
of
what
is
put
into
its
mouth
the
third
day
having
drank
at
breakfast
a
glass
of
milk
which
was
literally
mixed
with
the
dung
of
the
cow
my
stomach
rebelled
a
circumstance
which
i
regretted
exceedingly
attributing
it
to
my
want
of
monastic
perfection
i
envied
the
high
state
of
holiness
of
the
other
fathers
who
had
so
perfectly
attained
to
the
sublime
perfection
of
submission
that
they
could
drink
that
impure
milk
just
as
if
it
had
been
clean
everything
went
on
well
the
first
week
with
the
exception
of
a
dreadful
scare
i
had
at
the
dinner
of
the
first
friday
just
after
eating
soup
when
listening
with
the
greatest
attention
to
the
reading
of
the
life
of
a
saint
i
suddenly
felt
as
if
the
devil
had
taken
hold
of
my
feet
i
threw
down
my
knife
and
fork
and
i
cried
at
the
top
of
my
voice
my
god
my
god
what
is
there
and
as
quick
as
lightning
i
jumped
on
my
chair
to
save
myself
from
satan
s
grasp
my
cries
were
soon
followed
by
an
inexpressible
burst
of
convulsive
laughter
from
everyone
but
what
does
that
mean
who
has
taken
hold
of
my
feet
i
asked
father
guigues
tried
to
explain
the
matter
to
me
but
it
took
him
a
considerable
time
when
he
began
to
speak
an
irrepressible
burst
of
laughter
prevented
his
saying
a
word
the
fits
of
laughter
became
still
more
uncontrollable
on
account
of
the
seriousness
with
which
i
was
repeatedly
asking
them
who
could
have
taken
hold
of
my
feet
at
last
some
one
said
it
is
father
lagier
who
wanted
to
kiss
your
feet
at
the
same
time
father
lagier
walking
on
his
hands
and
knees
his
face
covered
with
sweat
dust
and
dirt
was
crawling
out
from
under
the
table
literally
rolling
on
the
floor
in
such
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
that
he
was
unable
to
stand
on
his
feet
of
course
when
i
understood
that
no
devil
had
tried
to
drag
me
by
the
feet
but
that
it
was
simply
one
of
the
father
oblates
who
to
go
through
one
of
the
common
practices
of
humility
in
that
monastery
had
crawled
under
the
table
to
take
hold
of
the
feet
of
everyone
and
kiss
them
i
joined
with
the
rest
of
the
community
and
laughed
to
my
heart
s
content
not
many
days
after
this
we
were
going
after
tea
from
the
to
the
chapel
to
pass
five
or
ten
minutes
in
adoration
of
the
we
had
two
doors
to
cross
and
it
was
pretty
dark
being
the
last
who
had
entered
the
monastery
i
had
to
walk
first
the
other
monks
following
me
we
were
reciting
with
a
loud
voice
the
latin
psalm
mihi
we
were
all
marching
pretty
fast
when
suddenly
my
feet
met
a
large
though
unseen
object
and
down
i
fell
and
rolled
on
the
floor
my
next
companion
did
the
same
and
rolled
over
me
and
so
did
five
or
six
others
who
in
the
dark
had
also
struck
their
feet
on
that
object
in
a
moment
we
were
five
or
six
holy
fathers
rolling
on
each
other
on
the
floor
unable
to
rise
up
splitting
our
sides
with
convulsive
laughter
father
brunette
in
one
of
his
fits
of
humility
had
left
the
table
a
little
before
the
rest
with
the
permission
of
the
superior
to
lay
himself
flat
on
the
floor
across
the
door
not
suspecting
it
and
unable
to
see
anything
from
the
want
of
sufficient
light
i
had
entangled
my
feet
on
that
living
corpse
as
also
the
rest
of
those
who
were
walking
too
close
behind
me
to
stop
before
tumbling
over
one
another
illustration
fall
of
the
holy
no
words
can
describe
my
feelings
of
shame
when
i
saw
almost
every
day
some
performance
of
this
kind
going
on
under
the
name
of
christian
humility
in
vain
i
tried
to
silence
the
voice
of
my
intelligence
which
was
crying
to
me
day
and
night
that
this
was
a
mere
diabolical
caricature
of
the
humility
of
christ
striving
to
silence
my
untamed
reason
by
telling
it
that
it
had
no
right
to
speak
and
argue
and
criticise
within
the
holy
walls
of
the
monastery
it
nevertheless
spoke
louder
day
after
day
telling
me
that
such
acts
of
humility
were
a
mockery
in
vain
i
said
to
myself
chiniquy
thou
art
not
come
here
to
philosophize
on
this
and
that
but
to
sanctify
thyself
by
becoming
like
a
corpse
which
has
no
preconceived
ideas
no
acquired
store
of
knowledge
no
rule
of
common
sense
to
guide
you
poor
wretched
sinful
chiniquy
thou
art
here
to
save
thyself
by
admiring
every
idea
of
the
holy
rules
of
your
superiors
and
to
obey
every
word
of
their
lips
i
felt
angry
against
myself
and
unspeakably
sad
when
after
whole
weeks
and
months
of
efforts
not
only
to
silence
the
voice
of
my
reason
but
to
kill
it
it
had
more
life
than
ever
and
was
more
and
more
loudly
protesting
against
the
unmanly
unchristian
and
ridiculous
daily
usages
and
rules
of
the
monastery
i
envied
the
humble
piety
of
the
other
good
fathers
who
were
apparently
so
happy
having
conquered
themselves
so
completely
as
to
destroy
that
haughty
reason
which
was
constantly
rebelling
in
me
twice
every
week
i
went
to
reveal
to
my
guide
and
confessor
father
allard
the
master
of
novices
my
interior
struggles
my
constant
though
vain
efforts
to
subdue
my
rebellious
reason
he
always
gladdened
me
with
the
promise
that
sooner
or
later
i
should
have
that
interior
perfect
peace
which
is
promised
to
the
humble
monk
when
he
has
attained
the
supreme
monastic
perfection
of
considering
himself
as
a
corpse
as
regards
the
rules
and
will
of
his
superiors
my
sincere
and
constant
efforts
to
reconcile
myself
to
the
rules
of
the
monastery
were
however
soon
to
receive
a
new
and
rude
check
i
had
read
in
the
book
of
rules
that
a
true
monk
must
closely
watch
those
who
live
with
him
and
secretly
report
to
his
superior
the
defects
and
sins
which
he
detects
in
them
the
first
time
i
read
that
strange
rule
my
mind
was
so
taken
up
by
other
things
that
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
it
but
the
second
time
i
studied
that
clause
the
blush
came
to
my
face
and
in
spite
of
myself
i
said
is
it
possible
that
we
are
a
band
of
spies
i
was
not
long
in
seeing
the
disastrous
effects
of
this
most
degrading
and
immoral
rule
one
of
the
fathers
for
whom
i
had
a
particular
affection
for
his
many
good
qualities
and
who
had
many
times
given
me
the
sincere
proof
of
his
friendship
said
to
me
one
day
for
god
s
sake
my
dear
father
chiniquy
tell
me
if
it
is
you
who
denounced
me
to
the
superior
for
having
said
that
the
conduct
of
father
guigues
toward
me
was
uncharitable
no
my
dear
friend
i
answered
i
never
said
such
a
thing
against
you
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
that
you
have
never
said
a
word
in
my
presence
which
could
give
me
the
idea
that
you
had
such
an
opinion
of
our
good
father
superior
the
second
reason
is
that
though
you
might
have
told
me
anything
of
that
kind
i
would
prefer
to
have
my
tongue
cut
and
eaten
by
dogs
than
to
be
a
spy
and
denounce
you
i
am
glad
to
know
that
he
rejoined
for
i
was
told
by
some
of
the
fathers
that
you
were
the
one
who
had
reported
me
to
the
superior
as
guilty
though
i
am
innocent
of
that
offense
but
i
could
not
believe
he
added
with
tears
i
regret
having
left
my
parish
to
be
an
oblate
on
account
of
that
abominable
law
which
we
are
sworn
to
fulfill
that
law
makes
a
real
hell
of
this
monastery
and
i
suppose
of
all
the
monastic
orders
for
i
think
it
is
a
general
law
with
all
the
religious
houses
when
you
have
passed
more
time
here
you
will
see
that
the
law
of
detection
puts
an
insurmountable
wall
between
us
all
it
destroys
every
spring
of
christian
and
social
i
understand
perfectly
well
what
you
say
i
answered
him
the
last
time
i
was
alone
with
father
superior
he
asked
me
why
i
had
said
that
the
present
pope
was
an
old
fool
he
persisted
in
telling
me
that
i
must
have
said
it
for
he
added
one
of
our
most
reliable
fathers
has
assured
me
you
said
well
my
dear
father
superior
i
answered
him
that
reliable
father
has
told
you
a
big
lie
i
never
said
such
a
thing
for
the
good
reason
that
i
sincerely
think
that
our
present
pope
is
one
of
the
wisest
that
ever
ruled
the
i
added
now
i
understand
why
there
is
so
much
unpleasantness
in
our
mutual
intercourse
during
the
hours
we
are
allowed
to
talk
i
see
that
nobody
dares
to
speak
his
mind
on
any
grave
subject
the
conversations
are
colorless
and
without
that
is
just
the
reason
answered
my
friend
when
some
of
the
fathers
like
you
and
me
would
prefer
to
be
hung
rather
than
become
spies
the
great
majority
of
them
particularly
among
the
french
priests
recently
imported
from
france
will
not
hear
ten
words
from
your
lips
on
any
subject
without
finding
an
opportunity
of
reporting
eight
of
them
as
unbecoming
and
unchristian
to
the
superiors
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
always
through
malice
that
they
give
such
false
reports
it
is
more
through
want
of
judgment
they
are
very
they
do
not
understand
the
half
of
what
they
hear
in
its
true
sense
and
they
give
their
false
impressions
to
the
superiors
who
unfortunately
encourage
that
system
of
spying
as
the
best
way
of
transforming
every
one
of
us
into
corpses
as
we
are
never
confronted
with
our
false
accusers
we
can
never
know
them
and
we
lose
confidence
in
each
other
thus
it
is
that
the
sweetest
and
holiest
springs
of
true
christian
love
are
forever
dried
up
it
is
on
this
spying
system
which
is
the
curse
and
the
hell
of
our
monastic
houses
that
a
celebrated
french
writer
who
had
been
a
monk
himself
wrote
of
all
the
monks
ils
rentrent
dans
leurs
monasteres
sans
se
connaitre
ils
y
vivent
sans
s
aimer
et
ils
se
separent
sans
se
regretter
monks
enter
the
monastery
without
knowing
each
other
they
live
there
without
loving
each
other
and
they
depart
from
each
other
without
any
regret
however
though
i
sincerely
deplored
that
there
was
such
a
law
of
espionage
among
us
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
it
was
like
the
dark
spots
of
the
sun
which
do
not
diminish
its
beauty
its
grandeur
and
its
innumerable
blessings
the
society
of
the
oblates
was
still
to
me
the
blessed
ark
where
i
should
find
a
sure
shelter
against
the
storms
which
were
desolating
the
rest
of
the
world
not
long
after
my
reception
as
a
novice
the
providence
of
god
put
before
my
eyes
one
of
those
terrible
wrecks
which
would
make
the
strongest
of
us
tremble
suddenly
at
the
hour
of
breakfast
the
superior
of
the
seminary
of
sulpice
and
grand
vicar
of
the
diocese
of
montreal
the
rev
quibiler
knocked
at
our
door
to
rest
an
hour
and
breakfast
with
us
when
on
his
way
to
france
this
unfortunate
priest
who
was
among
the
best
orators
and
the
best
looking
men
montreal
had
ever
seen
had
lived
such
a
profligate
life
with
his
penitent
nuns
and
ladies
of
montreal
that
a
cry
of
indignation
from
the
whole
people
had
forced
bishop
bourget
to
send
him
back
to
france
our
father
superior
took
the
opportunity
of
the
fall
of
that
talented
priest
to
make
us
bless
god
for
having
gathered
us
behind
the
walls
of
our
monastery
where
the
efforts
of
the
enemy
were
powerless
but
alas
we
were
soon
to
know
at
our
own
expense
that
the
heart
of
man
is
weak
and
deceitful
everywhere
it
was
not
long
after
the
public
fall
of
the
grand
vicar
of
montreal
when
a
widow
was
engaged
to
preside
over
our
kitchen
she
was
more
than
forty
years
old
and
had
very
good
manners
unfortunately
she
had
not
been
four
months
in
the
monastery
when
she
fell
in
love
with
her
father
confessor
one
of
the
most
pious
of
the
french
father
oblates
the
modern
adam
was
not
stronger
than
the
old
one
against
the
charms
of
the
new
eve
both
were
found
in
an
evil
hour
forgetting
one
of
the
holy
laws
of
god
the
guilty
priest
was
punished
and
the
weak
woman
dismissed
but
an
unspeakable
shame
remained
upon
us
all
i
would
have
preferred
to
have
my
sentence
of
death
than
the
news
of
such
a
fall
inside
the
walls
of
that
house
where
i
had
so
foolishly
believed
that
satan
could
not
lay
his
snares
from
that
day
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
the
strange
and
beautiful
illusions
which
had
brought
me
to
that
monastery
should
fade
away
one
after
the
other
like
the
white
mist
which
conceals
the
bright
rays
of
the
morning
sun
the
oblates
began
to
appear
to
me
pretty
much
like
other
men
till
then
i
had
looked
at
them
with
my
eyes
shut
and
i
had
seen
nothing
but
the
glittering
colors
with
which
my
imagination
was
painting
them
from
that
day
i
studied
them
with
my
eyes
opened
and
i
saw
them
just
as
they
were
in
the
spring
of
having
a
severe
indisposition
the
doctor
ordered
me
to
go
to
the
hotel
dieu
of
montreal
which
was
then
near
the
splendid
mary
s
church
i
made
there
for
the
first
time
the
acquaintance
of
a
venerable
old
nun
who
was
very
talkative
she
was
one
of
the
superiors
of
the
house
her
family
name
was
urtubise
her
mind
was
still
full
of
indignation
at
the
bad
conduct
of
two
father
oblates
who
under
the
pretext
of
sickness
had
lately
come
to
her
monastery
to
seduce
the
young
nuns
who
were
serving
them
she
told
me
how
she
had
turned
them
out
ignominiously
forbidding
them
ever
to
come
again
under
any
pretext
into
the
hospital
she
was
young
when
bishop
lartigue
being
driven
away
from
the
sulpician
seminary
of
montreal
in
had
taken
refuge
with
his
secretary
the
rev
ignace
bourget
into
the
modest
walls
of
that
nunnery
she
told
me
how
the
nuns
had
soon
to
repent
having
received
that
bishop
with
his
secretary
and
other
priests
it
was
nearly
the
ruin
of
our
community
the
intercourse
of
the
priests
with
a
certain
number
of
the
nuns
she
said
was
the
cause
of
so
much
disorder
and
scandal
that
i
was
deputed
with
some
other
nuns
to
the
bishop
to
respectfully
request
him
not
to
prolong
his
stay
in
our
nunnery
i
told
him
in
my
name
and
in
the
name
of
many
others
that
if
he
would
not
comply
with
our
legitimate
request
we
should
instantly
leave
the
house
go
back
to
our
families
and
get
married
that
it
was
better
to
be
honestly
married
than
to
continue
to
live
as
the
priests
even
our
father
confessors
wanted
us
to
after
she
had
given
me
several
other
spicy
stories
of
those
interesting
distant
days
i
asked
her
if
she
had
known
maria
monk
when
she
was
in
their
house
and
what
she
thought
of
her
book
awful
disclosures
i
have
known
her
well
she
said
she
spent
six
months
with
us
i
have
read
her
book
which
was
given
me
that
i
might
refute
it
but
after
reading
it
i
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that
deplorable
there
are
surely
some
inventions
and
suppositions
in
that
book
but
there
is
a
sufficient
amount
of
truth
to
cause
all
our
nunneries
to
be
pulled
down
by
the
people
if
only
the
half
of
them
were
known
to
the
public
she
then
said
to
me
for
god
s
sake
do
not
reveal
these
things
to
the
world
till
the
last
one
of
us
is
dead
if
god
spares
she
then
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
burst
into
tears
and
left
the
room
i
remained
horrified
her
words
fell
upon
me
as
a
thunderbolt
i
regretted
having
heard
them
though
i
was
determined
to
respect
her
request
not
to
reveal
the
terrible
secret
she
had
entrusted
to
me
my
god
knows
that
i
never
repeated
a
word
of
it
till
now
but
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
reveal
to
my
country
and
the
whole
world
the
truth
on
that
grave
subject
as
it
was
given
me
by
a
most
respectable
and
unimpeachable
the
terrible
secrets
which
sister
urtubise
had
revealed
to
me
rendered
my
stay
in
the
hotel
dieu
as
unpleasant
as
it
had
been
agreeable
at
first
though
not
quite
recovered
i
left
the
same
day
for
longueuil
where
i
entered
the
monastery
with
a
heavy
heart
the
day
before
two
of
the
fathers
had
come
back
from
a
two
or
three
months
evangelical
excursion
among
the
lumber
men
who
were
cutting
wood
in
the
forests
along
the
ottawa
river
and
its
tributaries
from
one
to
three
hundred
miles
of
montreal
i
was
glad
to
hear
of
their
arrival
i
hoped
that
the
interesting
history
of
their
evangelical
excursions
narrow
escapes
from
the
bears
and
the
wolves
of
the
forests
their
hearty
receptions
by
the
honest
and
sturdy
lumber
men
which
the
superior
had
requested
me
some
weeks
before
to
write
would
cause
a
happy
diversion
from
the
deplorable
things
i
had
recently
learned
but
only
one
of
those
fathers
could
be
seen
and
his
conversation
was
anything
but
interesting
and
pleasant
there
was
evidently
a
dark
cloud
around
him
and
the
other
oblate
his
companion
where
was
he
the
very
day
of
his
arrival
he
had
been
ordered
to
keep
his
room
and
make
a
retreat
of
ten
days
during
which
time
he
was
forbidden
to
speak
to
any
one
i
inquired
from
a
devoted
friend
among
the
old
oblates
the
reason
of
such
a
strange
thing
after
promising
never
to
reveal
to
the
superiors
the
sad
secret
he
trusted
me
with
he
said
poor
father
has
seduced
one
of
his
fair
penitents
on
the
way
she
was
a
married
woman
the
lady
of
the
house
where
our
missionaries
used
to
receive
the
most
cordial
hospitality
the
husband
having
discovered
the
infidelity
of
his
wife
came
very
near
killing
her
he
ignominiously
turned
out
the
two
fathers
and
wrote
a
terrible
letter
to
the
superior
the
companion
of
the
guilty
father
denounced
him
and
confessed
everything
to
the
superior
who
has
seen
that
the
letter
of
the
enraged
husband
was
only
giving
too
true
and
correct
version
of
the
whole
unfortunate
and
shameful
occurrence
now
the
poor
weak
father
for
his
penance
is
condemned
to
ten
days
of
seclusion
from
the
rest
of
the
community
he
must
pass
that
whole
time
in
prayer
fasting
and
acts
of
humiliation
dictated
by
the
do
these
deplorable
facts
occur
very
often
among
the
father
oblates
i
asked
my
friend
raised
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
to
heaven
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
answered
dear
father
chiniquy
would
to
god
that
i
might
be
able
to
tell
you
that
it
is
the
first
crime
of
that
nature
committed
by
an
oblate
but
alas
you
know
by
what
has
occurred
with
our
female
cook
not
long
ago
that
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
some
of
our
fathers
have
brought
disgrace
upon
us
all
and
you
know
also
the
abominable
life
of
father
telmont
with
the
two
nuns
at
ottawa
if
it
be
so
i
replied
where
is
the
spiritual
advantage
of
the
regular
clergy
over
the
secular
the
only
advantage
i
see
answered
my
friend
is
that
the
regular
clergy
gives
himself
with
more
impunity
to
every
kind
of
debauch
and
licentiousness
than
the
secular
the
monks
being
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
the
public
inside
the
walls
of
their
monastery
where
nobody
or
at
least
very
few
people
have
any
access
are
more
easily
conquered
by
the
devil
and
more
firmly
kept
in
his
chains
than
the
secular
priests
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
public
and
the
daily
intercourse
the
secular
priests
have
with
their
relations
and
parishioners
form
a
powerful
and
salutary
restraint
upon
the
bad
inclinations
of
our
depraved
nature
in
the
monastery
there
is
no
restraint
except
the
childish
and
ridiculous
punishment
of
retreats
kissing
of
the
floor
or
of
the
feet
the
prostration
of
the
ground
as
father
brunet
did
a
few
days
after
your
coming
among
us
there
is
surely
more
hypocrisy
and
selfishness
among
the
regular
than
the
secular
clergy
that
great
social
organization
which
forms
the
human
family
is
a
divine
work
yes
those
great
social
organizations
which
are
called
the
city
the
township
the
country
the
parish
and
the
household
where
every
one
is
called
to
work
in
the
light
of
day
is
a
divine
organization
and
makes
society
as
strong
pure
and
holy
as
it
can
be
i
confess
that
there
are
also
terrible
temptations
and
deplorable
falls
there
but
the
temptations
are
not
so
unconquerable
and
the
falls
not
so
irreparable
as
in
these
dark
recesses
and
unhealthy
prisons
raised
by
satan
only
for
the
birds
of
night
called
monasteries
or
nunneries
the
priest
and
the
woman
who
fall
in
the
midst
of
a
well
organized
christian
society
break
the
hearts
of
the
beloved
mother
cover
with
shame
a
venerable
father
cause
the
tears
of
cherished
sisters
and
brothers
to
flow
pierce
with
a
barbed
arrow
the
hearts
of
thousands
of
friends
they
forever
lose
their
honor
and
good
name
these
considerations
are
so
many
providential
i
dare
say
divine
shields
to
protect
the
sons
and
daughters
of
eve
against
their
own
frailty
the
secular
priest
and
the
woman
shrink
before
throwing
themselves
into
such
a
bottomless
abyss
of
shame
misery
and
regret
but
behind
the
thick
and
dark
walls
of
the
monastery
or
the
nunnery
what
has
the
fallen
monk
or
nun
to
fear
nobody
will
hear
of
it
no
bad
consequences
worth
mentioning
will
follow
except
a
few
days
of
retreat
some
insignificant
childish
ridiculous
penances
which
the
most
devoted
in
the
monastery
are
practicing
almost
every
day
as
you
ask
me
in
earnest
what
are
the
advantages
of
a
monastic
life
over
a
secular
in
a
moral
and
social
point
of
view
i
will
answer
you
in
the
monastery
man
as
the
image
of
god
forgets
his
divine
origin
loses
his
dignity
and
as
a
christian
he
loses
the
most
holy
weapons
christ
has
given
to
his
disciples
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
he
at
once
and
forever
loses
that
law
of
and
respect
for
others
which
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
legitimate
barriers
against
vice
yes
that
great
and
divine
law
of
which
god
himself
has
implanted
in
the
heart
of
every
man
and
woman
who
live
in
a
christian
society
is
completely
destroyed
in
the
monastery
and
nunnery
the
foundation
of
perfection
in
the
monk
and
the
nun
is
that
they
must
consider
themselves
as
corpses
do
you
not
see
that
this
principle
strikes
at
the
root
of
all
that
god
has
made
good
grand
and
holy
in
man
does
it
not
sweep
away
every
idea
of
holiness
purity
greatness
every
principle
of
life
which
the
gospel
of
christ
had
for
its
mission
to
reveal
to
the
fallen
children
of
adam
what
can
we
expect
from
a
corpse
and
what
respect
can
a
corpse
feel
for
the
other
corpses
which
surround
it
thus
it
is
that
the
very
idea
of
monastic
perfection
carries
with
it
the
destruction
of
all
that
is
good
pure
holy
and
spiritual
in
the
religion
of
the
gospel
it
destroys
the
very
idea
of
life
to
put
death
into
its
place
it
is
for
that
reason
that
if
you
study
the
true
history
the
lying
of
monachism
you
will
find
the
details
of
a
corruption
impossible
anywhere
else
not
even
among
the
lowest
houses
of
prostitution
read
the
memoirs
of
scipio
de
ricci
one
of
the
most
pious
and
intelligent
bishops
our
church
has
ever
had
and
you
will
see
that
the
monks
and
the
nuns
of
italy
lead
the
very
life
of
the
brutes
in
the
fields
yes
read
the
terrible
revelations
of
what
is
going
on
among
those
unfortunate
men
and
women
whom
the
iron
hand
of
monachism
keeps
tied
in
their
dark
dungeons
you
will
hear
from
the
very
lips
of
the
nuns
that
the
monks
are
more
free
with
them
than
the
husbands
are
with
their
legitimate
wives
you
will
see
that
every
one
of
those
monastic
institutions
is
sodom
the
monastic
axiom
that
the
highest
point
of
perfection
is
attained
only
when
you
consider
yourself
a
corpse
in
the
hand
of
your
superior
is
and
it
is
simply
diabolical
it
transforms
into
a
vile
machine
that
man
whom
god
had
created
in
his
likeness
and
made
forever
free
it
degrades
below
the
brute
that
man
whom
christ
by
his
death
has
raised
to
the
dignity
of
a
child
of
god
and
inheritor
of
an
eternal
kingdom
in
heaven
everything
is
mechanical
material
false
in
the
life
of
a
monk
and
a
nun
even
the
best
virtues
are
deceptions
and
lies
the
monks
and
the
nuns
being
perfect
only
when
they
have
renounced
their
own
free
will
and
intelligence
to
become
corpses
can
have
neither
virtues
nor
vices
their
best
actions
are
mechanical
their
acts
of
humility
are
to
crawl
under
the
table
and
kiss
the
feet
of
each
other
or
to
make
a
cross
on
a
dirty
floor
with
the
tongue
or
lie
down
in
the
dust
to
let
the
rest
of
the
monks
or
the
nuns
pass
over
them
have
you
not
remarked
how
these
monks
speak
with
the
utmost
contempt
of
the
rest
of
the
world
one
must
have
opportunities
as
i
have
had
of
seeing
the
profound
hatred
which
exists
among
all
monastic
orders
against
each
other
how
the
dominicans
have
always
hated
the
franciscans
and
how
they
both
hate
the
jesuits
who
pay
them
back
in
the
same
coin
what
a
strong
and
merciless
hatred
divides
the
oblates
to
whom
we
belong
from
the
jesuits
the
jesuits
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
showing
us
their
supreme
contempt
you
are
aware
that
on
account
of
those
bad
feelings
it
is
absolutely
forbidden
to
an
oblate
to
confess
to
a
jesuit
as
we
know
it
is
forbidden
to
the
jesuits
to
confess
to
an
oblate
or
to
any
other
priest
i
need
not
tell
you
for
you
know
that
their
vow
of
poverty
is
a
mask
to
help
them
to
become
rich
with
more
rapidity
than
the
rest
of
the
world
is
it
not
under
the
mask
of
that
vow
that
the
monks
of
england
scotland
france
and
italy
became
the
masters
of
the
richest
lands
of
those
countries
which
the
nations
were
forced
by
bloody
revolutions
to
wrench
from
their
grasp
i
have
seen
much
more
of
the
world
than
you
when
a
young
priest
i
was
the
chaplain
confessor
and
intimate
friend
of
the
duchesse
de
berry
the
mother
of
henry
now
the
only
legitimate
king
of
france
when
in
the
midst
of
those
great
and
rich
princes
and
nobles
of
france
i
never
saw
such
a
love
of
money
of
honor
of
vain
glory
as
i
have
seen
among
the
monks
since
i
have
become
one
of
them
when
the
duchess
de
berry
finished
her
providential
work
in
france
after
making
the
false
step
which
ruined
her
i
threw
myself
into
the
religious
order
of
the
chartreux
i
have
lived
several
years
in
their
palatial
monastery
of
rome
have
cultivated
and
enjoyed
their
sweet
fruits
in
their
magnificent
gardens
but
i
was
not
there
long
without
seeing
the
fatal
error
i
had
committed
in
becoming
a
monk
during
the
many
years
i
resided
in
that
splendid
mansion
where
laziness
stupidity
filthiness
gluttony
superstition
tediousness
ignorance
pride
and
unmentionable
immoralities
with
very
few
exceptional
cases
reigned
supreme
i
had
every
opportunity
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
their
midst
life
soon
became
an
unbearable
burden
but
for
the
hope
i
had
of
breaking
my
fetters
at
last
i
found
out
that
the
best
if
not
the
only
way
of
doing
this
was
to
declare
to
the
pope
that
i
wanted
to
go
and
preach
the
gospel
to
the
savages
of
america
which
was
and
is
still
true
i
made
my
declaration
and
by
the
pope
s
permission
the
doors
of
my
gaol
were
opened
with
the
condition
that
i
should
join
the
order
of
the
oblates
immaculate
in
connection
with
which
i
should
evangelize
the
savages
of
the
rocky
mountains
i
have
found
among
the
monks
of
canada
the
very
same
things
i
have
seen
among
those
of
france
and
italy
with
very
few
exceptions
they
are
all
corpses
absolutely
dead
to
every
sentiment
of
true
honesty
and
real
christianity
they
are
putrid
carcasses
which
have
lost
the
dignity
of
manhood
my
dear
father
chiniquy
he
added
i
trust
you
as
i
trust
myself
when
i
tell
you
for
your
own
good
a
secret
which
is
known
to
god
alone
when
i
am
on
the
rocky
mountains
i
will
raise
myself
up
as
the
eagles
of
those
vast
countries
and
i
shall
go
up
to
the
regions
of
liberty
light
and
life
i
will
cease
being
a
corpse
to
become
what
my
god
has
made
free
and
intelligent
man
i
will
cease
to
be
a
corpse
in
order
to
become
one
of
the
redeemed
of
christ
who
serve
god
in
spirit
and
in
truth
christ
is
the
light
of
the
world
monachism
is
its
night
christ
is
the
strength
the
glory
the
life
of
man
monachism
is
its
decay
shame
and
death
christ
died
to
make
us
free
the
monastery
is
built
up
to
make
slaves
of
us
christ
died
that
we
might
be
raised
to
the
dignity
of
children
of
god
monachism
is
established
to
bring
us
down
much
below
the
living
brutes
for
it
transforms
us
into
corpses
christ
is
the
highest
conception
of
humanity
monachism
is
its
lowest
yes
yes
i
hope
my
god
will
soon
give
me
the
favor
i
have
asked
so
long
when
i
shall
be
on
the
top
of
the
rocky
mountains
i
will
forever
break
my
fetters
i
will
rise
from
my
tomb
i
will
come
out
from
among
the
dead
to
sit
at
the
table
of
the
redeemed
and
eat
the
bread
of
the
living
children
of
i
do
regret
that
the
remarkable
monk
whose
abridged
views
on
monachism
i
have
here
given
should
have
requested
me
never
to
give
his
name
when
he
allows
me
to
tell
some
of
his
adventures
which
will
make
a
most
interesting
romance
faithful
to
his
promise
he
went
as
an
oblate
to
preach
to
the
savages
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
there
without
noise
he
slipped
out
of
their
hands
broke
his
chains
to
live
the
life
of
a
freedman
of
christ
in
the
holy
bonds
of
a
christian
marriage
with
a
respectable
american
lady
weak
and
timid
soldier
that
i
was
once
frightened
by
the
ruins
spread
everywhere
on
the
i
looked
around
to
find
a
shelter
against
the
impending
danger
i
thought
that
the
monastery
of
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
was
one
of
those
strong
towers
built
by
my
god
where
the
arrows
of
the
enemy
could
not
reach
me
and
i
threw
myself
into
it
but
hardly
beginning
to
hope
that
i
was
out
of
danger
behind
those
dark
and
high
walls
when
i
saw
them
shaking
like
a
drunken
man
and
the
voice
of
god
passed
like
a
hurricane
over
me
suddenly
the
high
towers
and
walls
around
me
fell
to
the
ground
and
were
turned
into
dust
not
one
stone
remained
on
another
and
i
heard
a
voice
saying
to
me
soldier
come
out
and
get
in
the
light
of
the
sun
trust
no
more
in
the
walls
built
by
the
hand
of
man
they
are
nothing
but
dust
come
and
fight
in
the
open
day
under
the
eyes
of
god
protected
only
by
the
gospel
banners
of
christ
come
out
from
behind
those
walls
they
are
a
diabolical
deception
a
snare
a
fraud
i
listened
to
the
voice
and
i
bade
adieu
to
the
inmates
of
the
monastery
of
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
when
on
the
first
of
october
i
pressed
them
on
my
heart
for
the
last
time
i
felt
the
burning
tears
of
many
of
them
falling
on
my
cheeks
and
my
tears
moistened
their
faces
for
they
loved
me
and
i
loved
them
i
had
met
there
several
noble
hearts
and
precious
souls
worthy
of
a
better
fate
oh
if
i
could
have
at
the
price
of
my
life
given
them
the
light
and
liberty
which
my
merciful
god
had
given
me
but
they
were
in
the
dark
and
there
was
no
power
in
me
to
change
their
darkness
into
light
the
hand
of
god
brought
me
back
to
my
dear
canada
that
i
might
again
offer
it
the
sweat
and
labors
the
love
and
life
of
the
least
of
its
sons
chapter
xliii
i
accept
the
hospitality
of
the
rev
brassard
of
give
my
reasons
for
leaving
the
oblates
to
bishop
presents
me
with
a
medallion
portrait
of
the
pope
and
a
splendid
crucifix
blessed
by
his
holiness
for
me
and
accepts
my
services
in
the
cause
of
temperance
in
the
diocese
of
montreal
the
eleven
months
spent
in
the
monastery
of
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
were
among
the
greatest
favors
god
has
granted
me
what
i
had
read
of
the
monastic
orders
and
what
my
honest
though
deluded
imagination
had
painted
of
the
holiness
purity
and
happiness
of
the
monastic
life
could
not
be
blotted
out
of
my
mind
except
by
a
kind
of
miraculous
interposition
no
testimony
whatever
could
have
convinced
me
that
the
monastic
institutions
were
not
one
of
the
most
blessed
of
the
gospel
their
existence
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
of
rome
was
for
me
an
infallible
token
of
her
divine
institution
and
one
of
the
strongest
proofs
that
those
heretics
were
entirely
separated
from
christ
without
religious
orders
the
protestant
denominations
were
to
me
as
dead
and
decayed
branches
cut
from
the
true
vine
which
are
doomed
to
perish
but
just
as
the
eyes
of
thomas
were
opened
and
his
intelligence
was
convinced
of
the
divinity
of
christ
only
after
he
had
seen
the
wounds
in
his
hands
and
side
so
i
could
never
have
believed
that
the
monastic
institutions
were
of
heathen
and
diabolical
origin
if
my
god
had
not
forced
me
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
and
to
touch
with
my
fingers
their
unspeakable
corruptions
though
i
remained
for
some
time
longer
a
sincere
catholic
priest
i
dare
say
that
god
himself
had
just
broken
the
strongest
tie
of
my
affections
and
respect
for
that
church
it
is
true
that
several
pillars
remained
on
which
my
robust
faith
in
the
holiness
and
apostolicity
of
the
church
rested
for
a
few
years
longer
but
i
must
here
confess
to
the
glory
of
god
that
the
most
solid
of
those
pillars
had
forever
crumbled
to
pieces
when
in
the
monastery
of
longueuil
long
before
my
leaving
the
oblates
many
influential
priests
of
the
district
of
montreal
had
told
me
that
my
only
chance
of
success
if
i
wanted
to
continue
my
crusade
against
the
demon
of
drunkenness
was
to
work
alone
those
monks
are
pretty
good
speakers
on
temperance
they
unanimously
said
but
they
are
nothing
else
than
a
band
of
comedians
after
delivering
their
eloquent
tirades
against
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
to
the
people
the
first
thing
they
do
is
to
ask
for
a
bottle
of
wine
which
soon
disappears
what
fruit
can
we
expect
from
the
preaching
of
men
who
do
not
believe
a
word
of
what
they
say
and
who
are
the
first
among
themselves
to
turn
their
own
arguments
into
ridicule
it
is
very
different
with
you
you
believe
what
you
say
you
are
consistent
with
yourself
your
hearers
feel
it
your
profound
scientific
and
christian
conviction
pass
into
them
with
an
irresistible
power
god

success
come
to
us
said
the
curates
not
as
sent
by
the
superior
of
the
oblates
but
as
sent
by
god
himself
to
regenerate
canada
present
yourself
as
a
french
canadian
priest
a
child
of
the
people
that
people
will
hear
you
with
more
pleasure
and
follow
your
advice
with
more
perseverance
let
them
know
and
feel
that
canadian
blood
runs
in
your
veins
that
a
canadian
heart
beats
in
your
breast
continue
to
be
in
the
future
what
you
have
been
in
the
past
let
the
sentiments
of
the
true
patriot
be
united
with
those
of
a
catholic
priest
and
when
you
address
the
people
of
canada
the
citadels
of
satan
will
crumble
everywhere
before
you
in
the
district
of
montreal
as
they
have
done
in
that
of
at
the
head
of
the
french
canadian
curates
who
thus
spoke
was
my
venerable
personal
friend
and
benefactor
the
rev
brassard
curate
of
longueuil
he
had
not
only
been
one
of
my
most
devoted
friends
and
teachers
when
i
was
studying
m
the
college
of
nicolet
but
had
helped
me
with
his
own
money
to
go
through
the
last
four
years
of
my
studies
when
i
was
too
poor
to
meet
my
collegiate
expenses
no
one
had
thought
more
highly
than
he
of
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
when
they
first
settled
in
canada
but
their
monastery
was
too
near
the
parsonage
for
their
own
benefit
his
sharp
eyes
high
intelligence
and
integrity
of
character
soon
detected
that
there
was
more
false
varnish
than
pure
gold
on
their
glittering
escutcheon
several
love
scrapes
between
some
of
the
oblates
and
the
pretty
young
ladies
of
his
parish
and
the
long
hours
of
night
spent
by
father
allard
with
the
nuns
established
in
his
village
under
the
pretext
of
teaching
them
grammar
and
arithmetic
had
filled
him
with
disgust
but
what
had
absolutely
destroyed
his
confidence
was
the
discovery
of
a
long
suspected
iniquity
which
at
first
seemed
incredible
to
him
father
guigues
the
superior
after
his
nomination
but
before
his
installation
to
the
bishopric
of
ottawa
had
been
closely
watched
and
at
last
discovered
opening
the
letters
of
brassard
which
many
times
had
passed
from
the
post
office
through
his
hands
that
criminal
action
came
very
near
being
brought
before
the
legal
courts
by
brassard
this
was
avoided
only
by
father
guigues
acknowledging
his
guilt
asking
pardon
in
the
most
humiliating
way
before
me
and
several
other
witnesses
long
before
i
left
the
oblates
brassard
had
said
to
me
the
oblates
are
not
the
men
you
think
them
to
be
i
have
been
sorely
disappointed
in
them
and
your
disappointment
will
be
no
less
than
mine
when
your
eyes
are
opened
i
know
that
you
will
not
remain
long
in
their
midst
i
offer
you
in
advance
the
hospitality
of
my
parsonage
when
your
conscience
calls
you
out
of
their
monastery
i
availed
myself
of
this
kind
invitation
on
the
evening
of
the
of
november
the
next
week
was
spent
in
preparing
the
memoir
which
i
intended
to
present
to
my
lord
bourget
bishop
of
montreal
as
an
explanation
of
my
leaving
the
oblates
i
knew
that
he
was
disappointed
and
displeased
with
the
step
i
had
taken
the
curate
of
chambly
rev
mignault
having
gone
to
the
bishop
to
express
his
joy
that
i
had
left
the
monks
in
order
to
serve
again
the
church
in
the
ranks
of
secular
clergy
had
been
very
badly
received
the
bishop
had
answered
him
mr
chiniquy
may
leave
the
oblates
if
he
likes
but
he
will
be
disappointed
if
he
expects
to
work
in
my
diocese
i
do
not
want
his
this
did
not
surprise
me
i
knew
that
those
monks
had
been
imported
by
him
from
france
and
that
they
were
pets
of
his
when
i
entered
their
monastery
just
eleven
months
before
he
was
just
starting
for
rome
and
expressed
to
me
the
pleasure
he
felt
that
i
was
to
join
them
my
reasons
however
were
so
good
and
the
memoir
i
was
preparing
was
so
full
of
undoubted
facts
and
unanswerable
arguments
that
i
was
pretty
sure
not
only
to
appease
the
wrath
of
my
bishop
but
to
gain
his
esteem
more
firmly
than
before
i
was
not
disappointed
in
my
expectation
a
few
days
later
i
called
upon
his
lordship
and
was
received
very
coldly
he
said
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
my
surprise
and
pain
at
the
rash
step
you
have
just
taken
what
a
shame
for
all
your
friends
to
see
your
want
of
consistency
and
perseverance
had
you
remained
among
those
good
monks
your
moral
strength
could
have
been
increased
more
than
but
you
have
stultified
yourself
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
as
well
as
in
mine
you
have
lost
the
confidence
of
your
best
friends
by
leaving
without
good
reasons
the
company
of
such
holy
men
some
bad
rumors
are
already
afloat
against
you
which
give
us
to
understand
that
you
are
an
unmanageable
man
a
selfish
priest
whom
the
superiors
have
been
forced
to
turn
out
as
a
black
sheep
whose
presence
could
not
be
any
longer
tolerated
inside
the
peaceful
walls
of
that
holy
those
words
were
uttered
with
an
expression
of
bad
feeling
which
told
me
that
i
had
not
heard
the
tenth
part
of
what
he
had
in
his
heart
however
as
i
came
into
his
presence
prepared
to
hear
all
kinds
of
bad
reports
angry
reproaches
and
humiliating
insinuations
i
remained
perfectly
calm
i
had
in
in
advance
resolved
to
hear
all
his
unfriendly
insulting
remarks
just
as
if
they
were
addressed
to
another
person
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
the
last
three
days
had
been
spent
in
prayers
to
obtain
that
favor
my
god
had
evidently
heard
me
for
the
storm
passed
over
me
without
exciting
the
least
unpleasant
feelings
in
my
soul
i
answered
my
lord
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
in
taking
the
solemn
step
of
leaving
the
monastery
of
longueuil
i
was
not
afraid
of
what
the
world
would
say
or
think
of
me
my
only
desire
is
to
save
my
soul
and
give
the
rest
of
my
life
to
my
country
and
my
god
in
a
more
efficacious
way
than
i
have
yet
done
the
rumors
which
seem
to
trouble
your
lordship
about
my
supposed
expulsion
from
the
oblates
do
not
affect
me
in
the
least
for
they
are
without
the
least
foundation
from
the
first
to
the
last
day
of
my
stay
in
that
monastery
all
the
inmates
from
the
superior
to
the
last
one
have
overwhelmed
me
with
the
most
sincere
marks
of
kindness
and
even
of
respect
if
you
had
seen
the
tears
which
were
shed
by
the
brothers
when
i
bade
them
adieu
you
would
have
understood
that
i
never
had
more
devoted
and
sincere
friends
than
the
members
of
that
religious
community
please
read
this
important
document
and
you
will
see
that
i
have
kept
my
good
name
during
my
stay
in
that
i
handed
him
the
following
testimonial
letter
which
the
superior
had
given
me
when
i
left
i
the
undersigned
superior
of
the
noviciate
of
the
oblates
of
mary
immaculate
at
longueuil
do
certify
that
the
conduct
of
chiniquy
when
in
our
monastery
has
been
worthy
of
the
sacred
character
which
he
possesses
and
after
this
year
of
solitude
he
does
not
less
deserve
the
confidence
of
his
brethren
in
the
holy
ministry
than
before
we
wish
moreover
to
give
our
testimony
of
his
persevering
zeal
in
the
cause
of
temperance
we
think
that
nothing
was
more
of
a
nature
to
give
a
character
of
stability
to
that
admirable
reform
and
to
secure
its
perfect
success
than
the
profound
reflections
and
studies
of
chiniquy
when
in
the
solitude
of
longueuil
on
the
importance
of
that
work
allard
of
the
noviciate
it
was
really
most
pleasant
for
me
to
see
that
every
line
of
that
document
read
by
the
bishop
was
blotting
out
some
of
the
stern
and
unfriendly
lines
which
were
on
his
face
when
speaking
to
me
nothing
was
more
amiable
than
his
manners
when
he
handed
it
back
to
me
saying
i
thank
god
to
see
that
you
are
still
as
worthy
of
my
esteem
and
confidence
as
when
you
entered
that
monastery
but
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
the
real
reasons
why
you
have
so
abruptly
separated
from
the
oblates
yes
my
lord
i
will
give
them
to
you
but
your
lordship
knows
that
there
are
things
of
such
a
delicate
nature
that
the
lips
of
man
shiver
and
rebel
when
required
to
utter
them
such
are
some
of
the
deplorable
things
which
i
have
to
mention
to
your
lordship
i
have
put
those
reasons
in
these
pages
which
i
respectfully
request
your
lordship
to
read
and
i
handed
him
the
about
thirty
pages
long
which
i
had
prepared
the
bishop
read
very
carefully
five
or
six
pages
and
said
are
you
positive
as
to
the
exactness
of
what
you
write
here
yes
my
lord
they
are
as
true
and
real
as
i
am
the
bishop
turned
pale
and
remained
a
few
minutes
silent
biting
his
lips
and
after
a
deep
sigh
said
is
it
your
intention
to
reveal
those
sad
mysteries
to
the
world
or
can
we
hope
that
you
will
keep
that
secret
my
lord
i
answered
if
your
lordship
and
the
oblates
deal
with
me
as
i
hope
they
will
do
as
with
an
honorable
catholic
priest
if
i
am
kept
in
the
position
which
an
honest
priest
has
a
right
to
fill
in
the
church
i
consider
myself
bound
in
conscience
and
honor
to
keep
those
things
secret
but
if
from
any
abuse
persecutions
emanating
from
the
oblates
or
any
other
party
i
am
obliged
to
give
to
the
world
the
true
reasons
of
my
leaving
that
monastic
order
your
lordship
understands
that
in
i
will
be
forced
to
make
these
revelations
but
the
oblates
can
not
say
a
word
or
do
anything
wrong
against
you
promptly
answered
the
bishop
after
the
honorable
testimony
they
have
given
it
is
true
my
lord
that
i
have
no
reason
to
fear
anything
from
the
oblates
i
answered
but
those
religious
men
are
not
the
only
ones
who
might
force
me
to
defend
myself
you
know
another
who
has
my
future
destinies
in
his
hands
you
know
that
my
future
course
will
be
shaped
on
his
own
toward
with
amiable
smile
the
bishop
answered
i
understand
you
but
i
pledge
myself
that
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
that
quarter
though
i
frankly
tell
you
that
i
would
have
preferred
seeing
you
work
as
a
member
of
that
monastic
institution
it
may
be
that
it
is
more
according
to
the
will
of
god
that
you
should
go
among
the
people
as
sent
by
god
rather
than
by
a
superior
who
might
be
your
inferior
in
the
eyes
of
many
in
that
glorious
temperance
of
which
you
are
evidently
the
blessed
apostle
in
canada
i
am
glad
to
tell
you
that
i
have
spoken
of
you
to
his
holiness
and
he
requested
me
to
give
you
a
precious
medal
which
bears
his
most
perfect
features
with
a
splendid
crucifix
his
holiness
has
graciously
attached
days
indulgences
for
every
one
who
will
take
the
pledge
of
temperance
in
kissing
the
feet
of
that
crucifix
wait
a
moment
added
the
bishop
i
will
go
and
get
them
and
present
them
to
when
the
bishop
returned
holding
in
his
hands
those
two
infallible
tokens
of
the
kind
sentiments
of
the
pope
towards
me
i
fell
on
my
knees
to
receive
them
and
press
them
both
to
my
lips
with
the
utmost
respect
my
feelings
of
joy
and
gratitude
in
that
happy
hour
can
not
be
expressed
i
remained
mute
for
some
time
with
surprise
and
admiration
when
holding
those
precious
things
which
were
coming
to
me
as
i
then
sincerely
believed
from
the
very
successor
of
peter
and
the
true
vicar
of
christ
himself
when
handing
me
those
sacred
gifts
the
bishop
addressed
me
the
kindest
words
which
a
bishop
can
utter
to
his
priest
or
a
father
to
his
beloved
son
he
granted
me
the
power
to
preach
and
hear
confessions
all
over
his
diocese
and
he
dismissed
me
only
after
having
put
his
hand
on
my
head
and
asked
god
to
pour
upon
me
his
most
abundant
benedictions
everywhere
i
should
go
to
work
in
the
holy
cause
of
temperance
in
canada
chapter

preparations
for
the

the
named

our
adorable
saviour

what
king
going
to
make
war
against
another
king
sitteth
not
down
first
and
consulteth
whether
he
be
able
with
ten
thousand
to
meet
him
that
cometh
against
him
with
twenty
thousand
luke
to
follow
that
advice
how
often
had
i
fallen
on
my
knees
before
my
god
to
implore
the
necessary
strength
and
wisdom
to
meet
that
terrible
enemy
which
was
marching
against
me
and
my
brethren
many
times
i
was
so
discouraged
by
the
sense
of
personal
incapacity
that
i
came
near
fainting
and
flying
away
at
the
sight
of
the
power
and
resources
of
the
foe
but
the
dear
saviour
s
voice
has
as
many
times
strengthened
me
saying
fear
not
i
am
with
thee
he
seemed
at
every
hour
to
whisper
in
my
ears
cheer
up
i
have
overcome
the
world
trusting
then
in
my
god
alone
for
victory
i
nevertheless
understood
that
my
duty
was
to
arm
myself
with
the
weapons
which
the
learned
and
the
wise
men
of
the
past
ages
had
prepared
i
again
studied
the
best
works
written
on
the
subject
of
wine
from
the
learned
naturalist
pleny
to
the
celebrated
sir
astley
cooper
i
not
only
compiled
a
multitude
of
scientific
notes
arguments
and
facts
from
these
books
but
prepared
a
manual
of
temperance
which
obtained
so
great
a
success
for
such
a
small
country
as
canada
that
it
went
through
four
editions
of
thousand
copies
in
less
than
four
years
but
my
best
source
of
information
and
wisdom
was
from
letters
received
from
father
mathew
and
my
personal
interviews
with
him
when
he
visited
the
united
states
the
first
time
i
met
him
in
boston
he
told
me
how
he
regretted
his
having
at
first
too
much
relied
on
the
excitement
and
enthusiasm
of
the
multitudes
those
fits
he
said
pass
away
as
quickly
as
the
clouds
of
the
storm
and
they
too
often
leave
no
more
traces
of
their
passage
persevere
in
the
resolution
you
have
taken
in
the
beginning
never
to
give
the
pledge
except
when
you
give
a
complete
course
of
lectures
on
the
damning
effects
of
intoxicating
drinks
how
can
we
expect
that
the
people
will
forever
give
up
beverages
which
they
honestly
though
ignorantly
believe
to
be
beneficial
and
necessary
to
their
body
the
first
thing
we
do
we
must
demonstrate
to
them
that
these
alcoholic
drinks
are
absolutely
destructive
of
their
temporal
as
well
as
of
their
eternal
life
so
long
as
the
priest
and
the
people
believe
as
they
do
that
rum
brandy
wine
beer
and
cider
give
strength
to
help
man
to
keep
up
his
health
in
the
midst
of
his
hard
labors
that
they
warm
his
blood
in
winter
and
cool
it
in
the
summer
all
our
efforts
and
even
our
successes
will
be
like
the
burning
bundle
of
straw
which
makes
a
bright
light
attracts
the
attention
for
a
moment
and
leaves
nothing
but
smoke
and
cinders
hundreds
of
times
i
have
seen
my
irish
countrymen
honestly
taking
the
pledge
for
life
but
before
a
week
had
elapsed
they
had
obtained
a
release
from
their
priest
under
the
impression
that
they
were
unable
to
earn
their
own
living
and
support
their
families
without
drinking
those
detestable
drugs
very
few
priests
in
ireland
have
taken
the
pledge
and
still
fewer
have
kept
it
in
new
york
only
two
irish
priests
have
given
up
their
intoxicating
glass
and
the
very
next
week
i
met
both
of
them
drunk
archbishop
hughes
turned
my
humble
efforts
into
ridicule
before
his
priests
in
my
own
presence
and
drank
a
glass
of
brandy
to
my
health
with
them
at
his
own
table
to
mock
me
and
here
in
boston
the
drinking
habits
of
the
bishop
and
his
priest
are
such
that
i
have
been
forced
through
to
quietly
withdraw
from
his
palace
and
come
to
this
hotel
this
bad
conduct
paralyzes
and
kills
in
saying
these
last
words
that
good
and
noble
man
burst
into
a
fit
of
convulsive
sobs
and
tears
his
breast
was
heaving
under
his
vain
efforts
to
suppress
his
sighs
he
concealed
his
face
in
his
hands
and
for
nearly
ten
minutes
he
could
not
utter
a
word
the
spectacle
of
the
desolation
of
a
man
whom
god
had
raised
so
high
and
so
much
blessed
and
the
tears
of
one
who
had
himself
dried
up
so
many
tears
and
brought
so
much
joy
peace
and
comfort
to
so
many
desolate
homes
has
been
one
of
the
most
solemn
lessons
my
god
ever
gave
me
i
then
learned
more
clearly
than
ever
that
all
the
glory
of
the
world
is
and
that
one
of
the
greatest
acts
of
folly
is
to
rely
for
happiness
on
the
praises
of
men
and
the
success
of
our
own
labors
for
who
had
received
more
merited
praises
and
who
had
seen
his
own
labors
more
blessed
by
god
and
man
than
father
mathew
whom
all
ages
will
call
the
apostle
of
temperance
of
ireland
my
gratitude
to
brassard
caused
me
to
choose
his
parish
near
montreal
for
the
first
grand
of
the
impending
struggle
against
the
enemy
of
my
god
and
my
country
and
the
first
week
of
advent
determined
upon
for
the
opening
of
the
campaign
but
the
nearer
the
day
chosen
to
draw
the
sword
against
the
modern
goliath
the
more
i
felt
the
solemnity
of
my
position
and
the
more
i
needed
the
help
of
him
on
whom
alone
we
can
trust
for
light
and
strength
i
had
determined
never
to
lecture
on
temperance
in
any
place
without
having
previously
inquired
from
the
most
reliable
sources
about
the
number
of
deaths
and
accidents
caused
by
drunkenness
the
last
fifteen
or
twenty
years
the
number
of
orphans
and
widows
made
by
drunkenness
the
number
of
rich
families
ruined
and
the
number
of
poor
families
made
poorer
by
the
same
cause
the
approximate
sum
of
money
expended
by
the
people
during
the
last
twenty
years
as
the
result
of
my
inquiries
i
learned
that
during
that
short
period
that
men
had
lost
their
lives
when
drunk
and
through
their
drunkenness
widows
and
orphans
had
been
left
in
the
lowest
degree
of
poverty
rich
families
had
been
entirely
ruined
and
turned
out
of
their
once
happy
homes
by
the
demon
of
intemperance
and
kept
poor
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
had
been
paid
in
cash
without
counting
the
loss
of
time
for
the
intoxicating
beverages
drank
by
the
people
of
longueuil
during
the
last
twenty
years
for
three
days
i
spoke
twice
a
day
to
crowded
houses
my
first
text
was
look
not
upon
the
wine
when
it
is
red
when
it
giveth
its
color
in
the
cup
when
it
moveth
itself
aright
at
last
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
and
stingeth
like
an
adder
prov
the
first
day
i
showed
how
alcoholic
beverages
were
biting
like
a
serpent
and
stinging
like
an
adder
by
destroying
the
lungs
the
brains
and
the
liver
the
nerves
and
the
muscles
the
blood
and
the
very
life
of
man
the
second
day
i
proved
that
intoxicating
drinks
were
the
most
implacable
and
cruel
enemies
of
the
fathers
the
mothers
the
children
of
the
young
and
the
old
of
the
rich
and
the
poor
of
the
farmers
the
merchants
and
the
mechanics
the
parish
and
the
country
the
third
day
i
proved
clearly
that
those
intoxicating
liquors
were
the
enemy
of
intelligence
and
the
soul
of
man
the
gospel
of
christ
and
of
his
holy
church
the
enemy
of
all
the
rights
of
man
and
the
laws
of
god
my
conclusion
was
that
we
were
all
bound
to
raise
our
hands
against
that
gigantic
and
implacable
foe
whose
arm
was
raised
against
every
one
of
us
i
presented
the
thrilling
tableau
of
our
friends
near
and
dear
relations
and
neighbors
fallen
and
destroyed
around
us
the
thousands
of
orphans
and
widows
whose
fathers
and
husbands
had
been
slaughtered
by
strong
drink
i
brought
before
their
minds
the
true
picture
of
the
starving
children
the
destitute
widows
and
mothers
whose
life
had
to
be
spent
in
tears
ignominy
desolation
and
unspeakable
miseries
from
the
daily
use
of
strong
drink
i
was
not
half
through
my
address
when
tears
flowed
from
every
eye
the
cries
and
sobs
so
much
drowned
my
voice
that
i
had
several
times
to
stop
speaking
for
a
few
minutes
then
holding
the
crucifix
blessed
and
given
to
me
by
the
pope
i
showed
what
christ
had
suffered
on
the
cross
for
sins
engendered
by
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
and
i
requested
them
to
listen
to
the
voices
of
the
thousands
of
desolate
orphans
widows
wives
and
mothers
coming
from
every
corner
of
the
land
the
voices
of
their
priests
and
their
church
the
voices
of
the
angels
the
virgin
mary
and
the
saints
in
heaven
the
voice
of
jesus
christ
their
saviour
calling
them
to
put
an
end
to
the
deluge
of
evils
and
unspeakable
iniquities
caused
by
the
use
of
those
cursed
drinks
for
said
i
those
liquors
are
cursed
by
millions
of
mothers
and
children
widows
and
orphans
who
owe
to
them
a
life
of
shame
tears
and
untold
desolation
they
are
cursed
by
the
virgin
mary
and
the
angels
who
are
the
daily
witnesses
of
the
iniquities
with
which
they
deluge
the
world
they
are
cursed
by
the
millions
of
souls
which
they
have
plunged
into
eternal
misery
they
are
cursed
by
jesus
christ
from
whose
hands
they
have
wrenched
untold
millions
of
souls
for
whom
he
died
on
every
one
of
those
truths
incontrovertible
for
roman
catholics
were
falling
with
irresistible
power
on
that
multitude
of
people
the
distress
and
consternation
were
so
profound
and
universal
that
they
reacted
at
last
on
the
poor
speaker
who
several
times
could
not
express
what
he
himself
felt
except
with
his
tears
and
his
sobs
when
i
hoped
that
by
the
great
mercy
of
god
all
resistances
were
subdued
the
obstacles
removed
the
intelligences
enlightened
the
wills
conquered
i
closed
the
address
which
had
lasted
more
than
two
hours
by
an
ardent
prayer
to
god
to
grant
us
the
grace
to
give
up
forever
the
use
of
those
cursed
poisons
and
i
requested
every
one
to
repeat
with
me
in
their
hearts
the
solemn
pledge
of
temperance
in
the
following
words
adorable
and
dear
saviour
jesus
christ
who
died
on
the
cross
to
take
away
my
sins
and
save
my
guilty
soul
for
thy
glory
the
good
of
my
brethren
and
of
my
country
as
well
as
for
my
own
good
i
promise
with
thy
help
never
to
drink
nor
to
give
to
anybody
any
intoxicating
beverages
except
when
ordered
by
an
honest
our
merciful
god
had
visibly
blessed
the
work
and
his
unprofitable
servant
the
success
was
above
our
sanguine
expectations
two
thousand
three
hundred
citizens
of
longueuil
enrolled
under
the
banners
of
temperance
instead
of
inviting
them
to
sign
any
written
pledge
i
asked
them
to
come
to
the
foot
of
the
altar
and
kiss
the
crucifix
i
was
holding
as
the
public
and
solemn
pledge
of
their
engagement
the
first
thing
done
by
the
majority
of
the
intelligent
farmers
of
longueuil
on
the
return
from
the
church
was
to
break
their
decanters
and
their
barrels
and
spill
the
last
drop
of
the
accursed
drink
on
the
ground
seven
days
later
there
were
eighty
requests
in
my
hands
to
go
and
show
the
ravages
of
alcoholic
liquors
to
many
other
parishes
boucherville
chambly
varennes
hyacinthe
three
rivers
the
great
city
of
montreal
with
all
the
priests
of
sulpice
the
parishes
along
the
chambly
river
laprairie
lachine
in
a
word
the
vast
diocese
of
montreal
three
rivers
and
hyacinthe
one
after
the
other
raised
the
war
cry
against
the
usages
of
intoxicating
drinks
with
a
unanimity
and
determination
which
seemed
to
be
more
miraculous
than
natural
during
the
four
years
i
gave
public
addresses
in
parishes
with
the
same
fruits
and
enrolled
more
than
people
under
the
banners
of
temperance
everywhere
the
taverns
the
distilleries
and
breweries
were
shut
and
their
owners
forced
to
take
other
trades
to
make
a
living
not
on
account
of
any
stringent
law
but
by
the
simple
fact
that
the
whole
people
had
ceased
drinking
their
beverages
after
having
been
fully
persuaded
that
they
were
injurious
to
their
bodies
opposed
to
their
happiness
and
ruinous
to
their
souls
the
convictions
were
so
unanimous
and
strong
on
that
subject
that
in
many
places
the
last
evening
i
spent
in
their
midst
the
merchants
used
to
take
all
their
barrels
of
rum
beer
wine
and
brandy
to
the
public
squares
make
a
pyramid
of
them
to
which
i
was
invited
to
set
fire
the
whole
population
attracted
by
the
novelty
and
sublimity
of
that
spectacle
would
then
fill
the
air
with
their
cries
and
shouts
of
joy
when
the
husbands
and
wives
the
parents
and
children
of
the
redeemed
drunkards
rent
the
air
with
their
cries
of
joy
at
the
destruction
of
their
enemy
and
the
fire
was
in
full
blaze
one
of
the
merchants
would
give
me
an
ax
to
stave
in
the
last
barrel
of
rum
after
the
last
drop
was
emptied
i
usually
stood
on
it
to
address
some
parting
words
to
the
people
such
a
spectacle
baffles
any
description
the
brilliant
lights
of
the
pine
and
cedar
trees
mixed
with
all
kinds
of
inflammable
materials
which
every
one
had
been
invited
to
bring
changed
the
darkest
hour
of
that
time
into
the
brightest
of
days
the
flames
fed
by
the
fiery
liquids
shot
forth
their
tongues
of
fire
towards
heaven
as
if
to
praise
their
great
god
whose
merciful
hand
had
brought
the
marvellous
reformation
we
were
celebrating
the
thousand
faces
illuminated
by
the
blaze
beamed
with
joy
the
noise
of
the
cracking
barrels
mixed
with
that
of
a
raging
fire
the
cries
and
shouts
of
that
multitude
with
the
singing
of
the
te
deum
formed
a
harmony
which
filled
every
soul
with
sentiments
of
unspeakable
happiness
but
where
shall
i
find
words
to
express
my
feelings
when
i
had
finished
speaking
the
mothers
and
wives
to
whom
our
blessed
temperance
had
given
back
a
loving
husband
and
some
dear
children
were
crowding
around
me
with
their
families
and
redeemed
ones
to
thank
me
press
my
hands
to
their
lips
and
water
them
with
their
grateful
tears
the
only
thing
which
marred
that
joy
were
the
exaggerated
honors
and
unmerited
praises
with
which
i
was
really
overwhelmed
i
was
at
first
forced
to
receive
an
ovation
from
the
curates
and
people
of
longueuil
and
the
surrounding
parishes
when
they
presented
to
me
my
portrait
painted
by
the
artist
hamel
which
filled
me
with
confusion
for
i
felt
so
keenly
that
i
did
not
deserve
such
honors
but
it
was
still
worse
at
the
end
of
may
judge
mondelet
was
deputed
by
the
bishop
and
the
priests
and
the
city
of
montreal
accompanied
by
people
to
present
me
with
a
gold
medal
and
a
gift
of
but
the
greatest
surprise
my
god
had
in
store
for
me
was
kept
for
the
end
of
june
at
that
time
i
was
deputed
by
teetotalers
to
present
a
petition
to
the
parliament
of
toronto
in
order
to
make
the
rumsellers
responsible
for
the
ravages
caused
to
the
families
of
the
poor
drunkards
to
whom
they
had
sold
their
poisonous
drugs
the
house
of
commons
having
kindly
appointed
a
committee
of
ten
members
to
help
me
to
frame
that
bill
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
have
it
pass
through
the
three
branches
i
was
present
when
they
discussed
and
accepted
that
bill
napoleon
was
not
more
happy
when
he
won
the
battle
of
austerlitz
than
i
was
when
i
heard
that
my
pet
bill
had
become
a
law
and
that
hereafter
the
innocent
victims
of
the
drunken
father
or
husband
would
receive
an
indemnity
from
the
landsharks
who
were
fattening
on
their
poverty
and
unspeakable
miseries
but
what
was
my
surprise
and
consternation
when
immediately
after
the
passing
of
that
bill
the
hon
dewitt
rose
and
proposed
that
a
public
expression
of
gratitude
should
be
given
me
by
parliament
under
the
form
of
a
large
pecuniary
gift
his
speech
seemed
to
me
filled
with
such
exaggerated
eulogiums
that
i
would
have
been
tempted
to
think
it
was
mockery
had
i
not
known
that
the
protestant
gentleman
was
one
of
my
most
sincere
friends
he
was
followed
by
the
honorables
baldwin
and
lafontaine
prime
minister
at
the
time
and
half
a
dozen
other
members
who
went
still
further
into
what
i
so
justly
consider
the
regions
of
exaggeration
it
seemed
to
me
bordering
on
blasphemy
to
attribute
to
chiniquy
a
reformation
which
was
so
clearly
the
work
of
my
merciful
god
the
speeches
on
that
subject
lasted
two
hours
and
were
followed
by
a
unanimous
vote
to
present
me
with
as
a
public
testimony
of
the
gratitude
of
the
people
for
my
labors
in
the
temperance
reform
of
canada
previous
to
that
the
bishops
of
quebec
and
montreal
had
given
me
tokens
of
their
esteem
which
though
unmerited
had
been
better
appreciated
by
me
when
in
may
the
archbishop
of
quebec
my
lord
turgeon
sent
the
rev
charles
baillargeon
curate
of
quebec
to
rome
to
become
his
successor
he
advised
him
to
come
to
longueuil
and
get
a
letter
from
me
which
he
might
present
to
the
pope
with
a
volume
of
my
temperance
i
complied
with
his
request
and
wrote
to
the
pope
some
months
later
i
received
the
following
lines
rome
rev
chiniquy
sir
and
dear
friend
the
was
the
first
opportunity
given
me
to
have
a
private
audience
with
the
sovereign
pontiff
i
presented
him
your
book
with
your
letter
which
he
received
i
will
not
say
with
that
goodness
which
is
so
eminently
characteristic
of
him
but
with
all
special
marks
of
satisfaction
and
approbation
while
charging
me
to
state
to
you
that
he
accords
his
apostolic
benediction
to
you
and
to
the
holy
work
of
temperance
you
preach
i
consider
myself
happy
to
have
had
to
offer
on
your
behalf
to
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
a
book
which
after
it
had
done
so
much
good
to
my
countrymen
had
been
able
to
draw
from
his
venerable
lips
such
solemn
words
of
approbation
of
the
temperance
society
and
of
blessings
on
those
who
are
its
apostles
and
it
is
also
from
my
heart
a
very
sweet
pleasure
to
transmit
them
to
you
your
friend
charles
baillargeon
a
short
time
before
i
received
that
letter
from
rome
my
lord
bourget
bishop
of
montreal
had
officially
given
me
the
title
of
apostle
of
temperance
in
the
following
documents
which
on
account
of
their
importance
the
readers

probably

the

we

with

of

no
words
from
my
pen
can
give
an
idea
of
the
distress
and
shame
i
felt
when
these
unmerited
praises
and
public
honors
began
to
flow
upon
me
for
when
the
siren
voice
of
my
natural
pride
was
near
to
deceive
me
there
was
the
noise
of
a
sudden
storm
in
my
conscience
crying
with
a
louder
voice
chiniquy
thou
art
a
sinner
unworthy
of
such
this
conflict
made
me
very
miserable
i
said
to
myself
are
those
great
successes
due
to
my
merits
my
virtues
and
my
eloquence
no
surely
no
they
are
due
to
the
great
mercy
of
god
for
my
dear
country
will
i
not
forever
be
put
to
shame
if
i
consent
to
these
flattering
voices
which
come
to
me
from
morning
till
night
to
make
me
forget
that
to
my
god
alone
and
not
to
me
must
be
given
the
praise
and
glory
of
that
marvellous
reform
these
praises
were
coming
every
day
thicker
and
thicker
through
the
thousand
trumpets
of
the
press
as
well
as
through
the
addresses
daily
presented
to
me
from
the
places
which
had
been
so
thoroughly
reformed
those
unmerited
honors
were
bestowed
on
me
by
multitudes
who
came
in
carriages
and
on
horseback
bearing
flags
with
bands
of
music
to
receive
me
on
the
borders
of
their
parishes
where
the
last
parishes
had
just
brought
me
with
the
same
kind
of
ovations
sometimes
the
roads
were
lined
on
both
sides
by
thousands
and
thousands
of
maple
pine
or
spruce
trees
which
they
had
carried
from
distant
forests
in
spite
of
all
my
protests
how
many
times
the
curates
who
were
sitting
by
me
in
the
best
carriages
drawn
by
the
most
splendid
horses
asked
me
why
do
you
look
so
sad
when
you
see
all
these
faces
beaming
with
joy
i
answered
i
am
sad
because
these
unmerited
honors
these
good
people
do
me
seems
to
be
the
shortest
way
the
devil
has
found
to
destroy
but
the
reform
you
have
brought
about
is
so
admirable
and
so
good
which
is
done
to
the
individuals
as
well
as
to
the
whole
country
is
so
great
and
universal
that
the
people
want
to
show
you
their
do
you
know
my
dear
friends
i
answered
that
that
marvellous
change
is
too
great
to
be
the
work
of
man
is
it
not
evidently
the
work
of
god
to
him
and
him
alone
then
we
ought
to
give
the
praise
and
the
my
constant
habit
after
these
days
of
ovation
was
to
pass
a
part
of
the
night
in
prayer
to
god
to
the
virgin
mary
and
to
all
the
saints
in
heaven
to
prevent
me
from
being
hurt
by
these
worldly
honors
it
was
my
custom
then
to
read
the
passion
of
jesus
christ
from
his
triumphant
entry
into
jerusalem
to
his
death
on
the
cross
in
order
to
prevent
this
shining
dust
from
adhering
to
my
soul
there
was
a
verse
of
the
gospel
which
i
used
to
repeat
very
often
in
the
midst
of
those
exhibitions
of
the
vanities
of
this
world
what
is
a
man
profited
if
he
should
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
matt
another
source
of
serious
anxiety
for
me
was
then
coming
from
the
large
sums
of
money
constantly
flowing
from
the
hands
of
my
too
kind
and
grateful
reformed
countrymen
into
mine
it
was
very
seldom
that
the
public
expression
of
gratitude
presented
me
in
their
rhetorical
addresses
were
not
accompanied
by
a
gift
of
from
to
according
to
the
means
and
importance
of
the
place
those
sums
multiplied
by
the
days
of
the
year
would
have
soon
made
of
me
one
of
the
richest
men
of
canada
had
i
been
able
to
trust
to
my
own
strength
against
the
hungers
of
riches
i
should
have
been
able
easily
to
accumulate
a
sum
of
at
least
with
which
i
might
have
done
a
great
amount
of
good
but
i
confess
that
when
in
the
presence
of
god
i
went
to
the
bottom
of
my
heart
to
see
if
it
were
strong
enough
to
carry
such
a
glittering
weight
i
found
it
by
far
too
weak
i
knew
so
many
who
though
evidently
stronger
than
i
was
had
fallen
on
the
way
and
perished
under
too
heavy
burden
of
their
treasures
that
i
feared
for
myself
at
the
sight
of
such
unexpected
and
immense
fortune
besides
when
only
years
old
my
venerable
and
dear
benefactor
the
rev
leprohon
director
of
the
college
of
nicolet
had
told
me
a
thing
i
never
had
forgotten
chiniquy
he
said
i
am
sure
you
will
be
what
we
call
a
successful
man
in
the
world
you
will
easily
make
your
way
among
your
contemporaries
and
consequently
it
is
probable
that
you
will
have
many
opportunities
of
becoming
rich
but
when
the
silver
and
gold
flow
into
your
hands
do
not
pile
and
keep
it
for
if
you
set
your
affections
on
it
you
will
be
miserable
in
this
world
and
damned
in
the
next
you
must
not
do
like
the
fattened
hogs
which
give
their
grease
only
after
their
death
give
it
while
you
are
living
then
you
will
not
be
blessed
only
by
god
and
man
but
you
will
be
blessed
by
your
own
conscience
you
will
live
in
peace
and
die
in
these
solemn
warnings
from
one
of
the
wisest
and
best
friends
god
had
ever
given
me
when
young
has
never
gone
out
of
my
mind
i
found
them
corroborated
in
every
page
of
that
bible
which
i
loved
so
much
and
studied
every
day
i
found
them
also
written
by
god
on
my
heart
i
then
on
my
knees
took
the
resolution
without
making
an
absolute
vow
of
it
to
keep
only
what
i
wanted
for
my
daily
support
and
give
the
rest
to
the
poor
or
some
christian
or
patriotic
object
i
kept
my
promise
the
given
me
by
parliament
did
not
remain
three
weeks
in
my
hands
i
never
put
a
cent
in
canada
in
the
vaults
of
any
bank
and
when
i
left
for
illinois
in
the
fall
of
instead
of
taking
with
me
as
it
would
have
been
very
easy
had
i
been
so
minded
i
had
hardly
in
hand
the
price
of
a
part
of
my
library
which
was
too
heavy
to
be
carried
so
far
away
chapter
xlv
my
sermon
on
the
virgin
of
bishop
first
serious
doubts
about
the
church
of
discussion
with
the
holy
fathers
opposed
to
the
modern
worship
of
the
branches
of
the
vine
the
of
august
i
preached
in
the
cathedral
of
montreal
on
the
blessed
virgin
mary
s
power
in
heaven
when
interceding
for
sinners
i
was
sincerely
devoted
to
the
virgin
mary
nothing
seemed
to
me
more
natural
than
to
pray
to
her
and
rely
on
her
protection
the
object
of
my
sermon
was
to
show
that
jesus
christ
can
not
refuse
any
of
the
petitions
presented
to
him
by
his
mother
that
she
has
always
obtained
the
favors
she
asked
her
son
jesus
to
grant
to
her
devotees
of
course
my
address
was
more
sentimental
than
scriptural
as
it
is
the
style
among
the
priests
of
rome
but
i
was
honest
and
i
sincerely
believed
what
i
said
who
among
you
my
dear
brethren
i
said
to
the
people
will
refuse
any
of
the
reasonable
requests
of
a
beloved
mother
who
will
break
and
sadden
her
loving
heart
when
with
supplicating
voice
and
tears
she
presents
to
you
a
petition
which
it
is
in
your
power
nay
to
your
interests
to
grant
for
my
own
part
were
my
beloved
mother
still
living
i
would
prefer
to
have
my
right
hand
crushed
and
burned
into
cinders
to
have
my
tongue
cut
than
to
say
no
to
my
mother
asking
me
any
favor
which
it
was
in
my
power
to
bestow
these
are
the
sentiments
which
the
god
of
sinai
wanted
to
engrave
in
the
very
hearts
of
humanity
when
giving
his
laws
to
moses
in
the
midst
of
lightning
and
thunders
and
these
are
the
sentiments
which
the
god
of
the
gospel
wanted
to
impress
on
our
souls
by
the
shedding
of
his
blood
on
calvary
these
sentiments
of
filial
respect
and
obedience
to
our
mothers
christ
jesus
the
son
of
god
and
son
of
mary
practiced
to
perfection
although
god
and
man
he
was
still
in
perfect
submission
to
the
will
of
his
mother
of
which
he
makes
a
law
to
each
of
us
the
gospel
says
in
reference
to
his
parents
joseph
and
mary
he
was
subject
unto
luke
what
a
grand
and
shining
revelation
we
have
in
these
few
short
words
jesus
was
subject
unto
mary
is
it
not
written
in
the
same
gospel
that
jesus
is
the
same
as
he
was
yesterday
and
will
be
forever
he
has
not
changed
he
is
still
the
son
of
mary
as
he
was
when
only
twelve
years
old
this
is
why
our
holy
church
which
is
the
pillar
and
foundation
of
truth
invites
you
and
me
to
put
an
unbounded
confidence
in
her
intercession
remembering
that
jesus
has
always
granted
the
petitions
presented
to
him
by
his
divine
mother
let
us
put
our
petitions
in
her
hands
if
we
want
to
receive
the
favors
we
are
in
need
of
the
second
reason
why
we
must
all
go
to
mary
for
the
favors
we
want
from
heaven
is
that
we
are
in
the
sight
of
god
jesus
christ
is
our
saviour
yes
but
he
is
also
our
god
infinitely
just
infinitely
holy
he
hates
our
sins
with
an
infinite
hatred
he
abhors
our
rebellions
with
an
infinite
a
godly
hatred
if
we
had
loved
and
served
him
faithfully
we
might
go
to
him
not
only
with
the
hope
but
with
the
assurance
of
being
welcomed
but
we
have
forgotten
and
offended
him
we
have
trampled
his
laws
under
our
feet
we
have
joined
with
those
who
nailed
him
on
the
cross
pierced
his
heart
with
the
lance
and
shed
his
blood
to
the
last
drop
we
belong
to
the
crowd
which
mocked
at
his
tortures
and
insulted
him
at
his
death
how
can
we
dare
to
look
at
him
and
meet
his
eyes
must
we
not
tremble
in
his
presence
must
we
not
fear
before
that
lion
of
the
tribe
of
judah
whom
we
have
wounded
and
nailed
to
the
cross
where
is
the
rebel
who
does
not
shiver
when
he
is
dragged
to
the
feet
of
the
mighty
prince
against
whom
he
has
drawn
the
sword
what
will
he
do
if
he
wants
to
obtain
pardon
will
he
go
himself
and
speak
to
that
offended
majesty
no
but
he
looks
around
the
throne
to
see
if
he
can
find
some
one
of
the
great
officers
and
friends
or
some
powerful
and
influential
person
through
whose
intercession
he
can
obtain
pardon
if
he
finds
any
such
he
goes
immediately
to
him
puts
his
petitions
into
their
hands
and
they
go
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
to
plead
for
the
rebel
and
the
favor
which
would
have
been
indignantly
refused
to
the
guilty
subject
had
he
dared
to
speak
himself
is
granted
when
it
is
asked
by
a
faithful
officer
a
kind
friend
a
dear
sister
or
a
beloved
mother
this
is
why
our
holy
church
speaking
through
her
infallible
supreme
pontiff
the
vicar
of
christ
gregory
has
told
us
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
mary
is
the
only
hope
of
winding
up
my
arguments
i
added
we
are
those
insolent
ungrateful
rebels
jesus
is
the
king
of
kings
against
whom
we
have
a
thousand
times
risen
in
rebellion
he
has
a
thousand
good
reasons
to
refuse
our
petitions
if
we
are
impudent
enough
to
speak
to
him
ourselves
but
look
at
the
right
hand
of
the
offended
king
and
behold
his
dear
and
divine
mother
she
is
your
mother
also
for
it
is
to
every
one
of
us
as
well
as
to
john
that
christ
said
on
the
cross
speaking
of
mary
behold
your
jesus
has
never
refused
any
favor
asked
by
that
queen
of
heaven
he
can
not
rebuke
his
mother
let
us
go
to
her
let
us
ask
her
to
be
our
advocate
and
plead
our
cause
and
she
will
do
it
let
us
suppliantly
request
her
to
ask
for
our
pardon
and
she
will
get
i
then
sincerely
took
these
glittering
sophisms
for
the
true
religion
of
christ
as
all
the
priests
and
people
of
rome
are
bound
to
take
them
and
presented
them
with
all
the
earnestness
of
an
honest
though
deluded
mind
my
sermon
had
made
a
visible
and
deep
impression
bishop
prince
coadjutor
of
my
lord
bourget
who
was
among
my
hearers
thanked
and
congratulated
me
for
the
good
effect
it
would
have
on
the
people
and
i
sincerely
thought
i
had
said
what
was
true
and
right
before
god
but
when
night
came
before
going
to
bed
i
took
my
bible
as
usual
knelt
down
before
god
in
the
neat
little
room
i
occupied
in
the
bishop
s
palace
and
read
the
twelfth
chapter
of
matthew
with
a
praying
heart
and
a
sincere
desire
to
understand
it
and
be
benefitted
thereby
strange
to
say
when
i
reached
the
verse
i
felt
a
mysterious
awe
as
if
i
had
entered
for
the
first
time
into
a
new
and
most
holy
land
though
i
had
read
that
verse
and
the
following
many
times
they
came
to
my
mind
with
a
freshness
and
newness
as
if
i
had
never
seen
them
before
there
was
a
lull
in
my
mind
for
a
few
moments
slowly
and
with
breathless
attention
supreme
veneration
and
respect
i
read
the
history
of
that
visit
of
mary
to
the
sacred
spot
where
jesus
my
saviour
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
feeding
his
happy
hearers
with
the
bread
of
life
when
i
contemplated
that
blessed
mary
whom
i
loved
as
so
tenderly
approaching
the
house
where
she
was
to
meet
her
divine
son
who
had
been
so
long
absent
from
her
my
heart
suddenly
throbbed
in
sympathy
with
hers
i
felt
as
if
sharing
her
unspeakable
joy
at
every
step
which
brought
her
nearer
to
her
adorable
and
beloved
son
what
tears
had
she
not
shed
when
jesus
had
left
her
alone
in
her
poor
now
and
cheerless
home
that
he
might
preach
the
gospel
in
the
distant
places
where
his
father
had
sent
him
with
jesus
in
her
humble
home
was
she
not
more
happy
than
the
greatest
queen
on
her
throne
did
she
not
possess
a
treasure
more
precious
than
all
the
world
how
sweet
to
her
ears
were
the
words
she
had
heard
from
his
lips
how
lovely
the
face
of
the
most
beautiful
among
the
sons
of
men
how
happy
she
must
have
felt
when
she
heard
that
he
was
now
near
enough
to
allow
her
to
go
and
see
him
how
quick
were
her
steps
how
cheerful
and
interesting
the
meeting
how
the
beloved
saviour
will
repay
by
his
respectful
and
divine
love
to
his
mother
the
trouble
and
the
fatigue
of
her
long
journey
my
heart
beat
with
joy
at
the
privilege
of
witnessing
that
interview
and
of
hearing
the
respectful
words
jesus
would
address
to
his
mother
with
heart
and
soul
throbbing
with
these
feelings
i
slowly
read
while
he
talked
to
the
people
behold
his
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
without
desiring
to
speak
with
him
then
one
said
unto
him
behold
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without
desiring
to
speak
with
thee
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
him
who
is
my
mother
who
my
brethren
and
he
stretched
forth
his
hands
towards
his
disciples
and
said
behold
my
mother
and
brethren
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
same
is
my
brother
sister
and
i
had
hardly
finished
reading
the
last
verse
when
big
drops
of
sweat
began
to
flow
from
my
face
my
heart
beat
with
a
tremendous
speed
and
i
came
near
fainting
i
sat
in
my
large
armchair
expecting
every
minute
to
fall
on
the
floor
those
alone
who
have
stood
several
hours
at
the
fall
of
the
marvellous
niagara
heard
the
thundering
noise
of
its
waters
and
felt
the
shaking
of
the
rocks
under
their
feet
can
have
any
idea
of
what
i
felt
in
that
hour
of
agony
a
voice
the
voice
of
my
conscience
whose
thunders
were
like
the
voice
of
a
thousand
niagaras
was
telling
me
do
you
not
see
that
you
have
preached
a
sacrilegious
lie
this
morning
when
from
the
pulpit
you
said
to
your
ignorant
and
deluded
people
that
jesus
always
granted
the
petitions
of
his
mother
mary
are
you
not
ashamed
to
deceive
yourself
and
deceive
your
poor
countrymen
with
such
silly
falsehoods
reader
read
again
these
words
and
understand
that
far
from
granting
all
the
petitions
of
mary
jesus
has
always
except
when
a
child
said
no
to
her
requests
he
has
always
rebuked
her
when
she
asked
him
anything
in
public
here
she
comes
to
ask
him
a
favor
before
the
whole
people
it
is
the
easiest
the
most
natural
favor
that
a
mother
ever
asked
of
her
son
it
is
a
favor
that
a
son
has
never
refused
to
a
mother
he
answers
by
a
rebuke
a
public
and
solemn
rebuke
is
it
through
want
of
love
and
respect
for
mary
that
he
gave
her
that
rebuke
no
never
a
son
loved
and
respected
a
mother
as
he
did
but
it
was
a
solemn
protest
against
the
blasphemous
worship
of
mary
as
practiced
in
the
church
of
rome
i
felt
at
once
so
bewildered
and
confounded
by
the
voice
which
was
shaking
my
very
bones
that
i
thought
it
was
the
devil
s
voice
and
for
a
moment
i
feared
less
i
was
possessed
of
a
demon
my
god
i
cried
have
mercy
on
me
come
to
my
help
save
me
from
my
enemy
s
hands
as
quick
as
lightning
the
answer
came
it
is
not
satan
s
voice
you
hear
it
is
i
thy
saviour
and
thy
god
who
speaks
to
thee
read
what
mark
luke
and
john
tell
you
about
the
way
i
received
petitions
from
the
very
day
i
began
to
work
and
speak
publicly
as
the
son
of
god
and
the
saviour
of
the
these
cries
of
my
awakening
intelligence
were
sounding
in
my
ears
for
more
than
one
hour
before
i
consented
to
obey
them
at
last
with
a
trembling
hand
and
a
distressed
mind
i
took
my
bible
and
read
in
mark
chapter
iii
verses
and
there
came
then
his
brethren
and
his
mother
and
standing
without
sent
unto
him
and
calling
him
and
the
multitude
sat
about
him
and
they
said
unto
him
behold
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
without
sending
for
thee
and
he
answered
them
saying
who
is
my
mother
and
my
brethren
and
he
looked
round
about
on
them
which
sat
about
him
and
said
behold
my
mother
and
my
brethren
for
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
god
the
same
is
my
brother
my
sister
and
my
the
reading
of
these
words
acted
upon
me
as
the
shock
of
a
sword
going
through
and
through
the
body
of
one
who
had
already
been
mortally
wounded
i
felt
absolutely
confounded
the
voice
continued
to
sound
in
my
ears
do
you
not
see
you
have
presented
a
blasphemous
lie
every
time
you
said
that
jesus
always
granted
the
petitions
of
his
mother
i
remained
again
a
considerable
time
bewildered
not
knowing
how
to
fight
down
thoughts
which
were
so
mercilessly
shaking
my
faith
and
demolishing
the
respect
i
had
kept
till
then
for
my
church
after
more
than
half
an
hour
of
vain
struggle
to
silence
these
thoughts
it
came
to
my
mind
that
luke
had
narrated
this
interview
of
mary
and
jesus
in
a
very
different
way
i
opened
the
holy
book
again
to
read
the
eighth
chapter
but
how
shall
i
find
words
to
express
my
distress
when
i
saw
that
the
rebuke
of
jesus
christ
was
expressed
in
a
still
sterner
way
by
luke
than
by
the
two
other
evangelists
then
came
to
him
his
mother
and
brethren
and
could
not
come
at
him
for
the
press
and
it
was
told
him
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
stand
without
desiring
to
see
thee
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
them
my
mother
and
brethren
are
those
who
will
hear
the
word
of
god
and
do
luke
viii
it
then
seemed
to
me
as
if
those
three
evangelists
said
to
me
how
dare
you
preach
with
your
apostate
and
lying
church
that
jesus
has
always
granted
all
the
petitions
of
mary
when
we
were
ordered
by
god
to
write
and
proclaim
that
all
the
public
petitions
she
had
presented
to
him
when
working
as
the
son
of
god
and
the
saviour
of
the
world
had
been
answered
by
a
public
rebuke
what
could
i
answer
how
could
i
stand
the
rebuke
of
these
three
evangelists
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
fell
upon
my
knees
crying
to
the
virgin
mary
to
come
to
my
help
and
pray
that
i
might
not
succumb
to
this
temptation
and
lose
my
faith
and
confidence
in
her
but
the
more
i
prayed
the
louder
the
voice
seemed
to
say
how
dare
you
preach
that
jesus
has
always
granted
the
petitions
of
mary
when
we
tell
you
the
contrary
by
the
order
of
god
himself
my
desolation
became
such
that
a
cold
sweat
covered
my
whole
frame
again
my
head
was
aching
and
i
think
i
would
have
fainted
had
i
not
been
released
by
a
torrent
of
tears
in
my
distress
i
cried
oh
my
god
my
god
look
down
upon
me
in
thy
mercy
strengthen
my
faith
in
thy
holy
church
grant
me
to
follow
her
voice
and
obey
her
commands
with
more
and
more
fidelity
she
is
thy
beloved
church
she
can
not
err
she
can
not
be
an
apostate
but
in
vain
i
wept
and
cried
for
help
my
whole
being
was
filled
with
dismay
and
terror
from
the
voices
of
the
three
witnesses
who
were
crying
louder
and
louder
how
dare
you
preach
that
christ
has
always
granted
the
petitions
of
mary
when
the
gospels
written
under
the
inspiration
of
the
holy
ghost
tell
you
so
clearly
the
contrary
when
i
had
in
vain
wept
prayed
cried
and
struggled
from
ten
at
night
till
three
in
the
morning
the
miraculous
change
of
water
into
wine
by
christ
at
the
request
of
his
mother
suddenly
came
to
my
mind
i
felt
a
momentary
relief
from
my
terrible
distress
by
the
hope
that
i
could
prove
to
myself
that
in
this
case
the
saviour
had
obeyed
the
demands
of
his
holy
mother
i
eagerly
opened
my
bible
again
and
read
and
the
third
day
there
was
a
marriage
in
cana
of
galilee
and
the
mother
of
jesus
was
there
and
both
jesus
was
called
and
his
disciples
to
the
marriage
and
when
they
wanted
wine
the
mother
of
jesus
said
unto
him
they
have
no
wine
jesus
saith
unto
her
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
mine
hour
is
not
yet
come
his
mother
saith
unto
the
servants
whatsoever
he
saith
unto
you
do
john
ii
till
that
hour
i
had
always
accepted
that
text
in
the
sense
given
in
the
church
of
rome
as
proving
that
the
very
first
miracle
of
jesus
christ
was
wrought
at
the
request
of
his
mother
and
i
was
preparing
myself
to
answer
the
three
mysterious
witnesses
here
is
the
proof
that
you
are
three
devils
and
not
three
evangelists
when
you
tell
me
that
jesus
has
never
granted
the
petitions
of
his
mother
except
when
a
child
here
is
the
glorious
title
of
mary
to
my
confidence
in
her
intercession
here
is
the
seal
of
her
irresistible
superhuman
power
over
her
divine
son
here
is
the
undeniable
evidence
that
jesus
can
not
refuse
anything
asked
by
his
divine
mother
but
when
armed
with
these
explanations
of
the
church
i
was
preparing
to
meet
what
matthew
mark
and
luke
had
just
told
me
a
sudden
distressing
thought
came
to
my
mind
and
this
thought
was
as
if
i
heard
the
three
witnesses
saying
how
can
you
be
so
blind
as
not
to
see
that
instead
of
being
a
favor
granted
to
mary
this
first
miracle
is
the
first
opportunity
chosen
by
christ
to
protest
against
her
intercession
it
is
a
solemn
warning
to
mary
never
to
ask
anything
from
him
and
to
us
never
to
put
any
confidence
in
her
requests
here
mary
evidently
full
of
compassion
for
those
poor
people
who
had
not
the
means
to
provide
the
wine
for
the
guests
who
had
come
with
jesus
wants
her
son
to
give
them
the
wine
they
wanted
how
does
christ
answer
her
requests
he
answers
it
by
a
rebuke
a
most
solemn
rebuke
instead
of
saying
yes
mother
i
will
do
as
you
wish
he
says
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
which
clearly
means
woman
thou
hast
nothing
to
do
in
this
matter
i
do
not
want
you
to
speak
to
me
of
the
bridegroom
s
distress
it
was
my
desire
to
come
to
their
help
and
show
my
divine
power
i
do
not
want
you
to
put
yourself
between
the
wants
of
humanity
and
me
i
do
not
want
the
world
to
believe
that
you
had
any
right
any
power
or
influence
over
me
or
more
compassion
on
the
miseries
of
man
than
i
have
is
it
not
to
me
and
me
alone
the
lost
children
of
adam
must
look
to
be
saved
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
in
my
great
work
of
saving
this
perishing
world
nothing
absolutely
nothing
i
know
what
i
have
to
do
to
fulfill
not
your
will
but
my
father
s
will
this
is
what
jesus
meant
by
the
solemn
rebuke
given
to
mary
he
wanted
to
banish
all
idea
of
her
ever
becoming
an
intercessor
between
man
and
christ
he
wanted
to
protest
against
the
doctrine
of
the
church
of
rome
that
it
is
through
mary
that
he
will
bestow
his
favor
to
his
disciples
and
mary
understood
it
well
when
she
said
whatsoever
he
saith
unto
you
do
never
come
to
me
but
go
to
him
for
there
is
no
other
name
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
every
one
of
these
thoughts
passed
over
my
distressed
soul
like
a
hurricane
every
sentence
was
like
a
flash
of
lightning
in
a
dark
night
i
was
like
the
poor
dismantled
ship
suddenly
overtaken
by
the
tempest
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
till
the
dawn
of
day
i
felt
powerless
against
the
efforts
of
god
to
pull
down
and
demolish
the
huge
fortress
of
sophisms
falsehoods
idolatries
which
rome
had
built
around
my
soul
what
a
fearful
thing
it
is
to
fight
against
the
lord
during
the
long
hours
of
that
night
my
god
was
contending
with
me
and
i
was
struggling
against
him
but
though
brought
down
to
the
dust
i
was
not
conquered
my
understanding
was
very
nearly
convinced
but
my
rebellious
and
proud
will
was
not
yet
ready
to
yield
the
chains
by
which
i
was
tied
to
the
feet
of
the
idols
of
rome
though
rudely
shaken
were
not
yet
broken
however
to
say
the
truth
my
views
about
the
worship
of
mary
had
received
a
severe
shock
and
were
much
modified
that
night
had
been
sleepless
and
in
the
morning
my
eyes
were
red
and
my
face
swollen
with
my
tears
when
at
breakfast
bishop
prince
who
was
sitting
by
me
asked
are
you
sick
your
eyes
are
as
if
you
had
wept
all
night
your
lordship
is
not
mistaken
i
have
wept
the
whole
night
i
answered
wept
all
the
night
replied
the
bishop
might
i
know
the
cause
of
your
sorrow
yes
my
lord
you
can
you
must
know
it
but
please
come
to
your
room
what
i
have
to
say
is
of
such
a
private
and
delicate
nature
that
i
want
to
be
alone
with
your
lordship
when
opening
my
mind
to
the
cause
of
my
bishop
prince
then
coadjutor
of
bishop
bourget
and
late
bishop
of
hyacinthe
where
he
became
insane
in
and
died
in
had
been
my
personal
friend
from
the
time
i
entered
the
college
at
nicolet
where
he
was
professor
of
rhetoric
he
very
often
came
to
confession
to
me
and
had
taken
a
lively
interest
in
my
labors
on
temperance
when
alone
with
him
i
said
my
lord
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
in
allowing
me
to
unburden
my
heart
to
you
i
have
passed
the
most
horrible
night
of
my
life
temptations
against
our
holy
religion
such
as
i
never
had
before
have
assailed
me
all
night
your
lordship
remembers
the
kind
words
you
addressed
to
me
yesterday
about
the
sermon
i
preached
but
last
night
very
different
things
came
to
my
mind
which
have
changed
the
joys
of
yesterday
into
the
most
unspeakable
desolation
you
congratulated
me
yesterday
on
the
manner
i
had
proved
that
jesus
had
always
granted
the
request
of
his
mother
and
that
he
can
not
refuse
any
of
her
petitions
the
whole
night
it
has
been
told
to
me
that
this
was
a
blasphemous
lie
and
from
the
holy
scriptures
themselves
i
have
been
nearly
convinced
that
you
and
i
nay
that
our
holy
church
are
preaching
a
blasphemous
falsehood
every
time
we
proclaim
the
doctrines
of
the
worship
of
mary
as
the
gospel
the
poor
bishop
thunderstruck
by
this
simple
and
honest
declaration
quickly
answered
i
hope
you
have
not
yielded
to
these
temptations
and
that
you
will
not
become
a
protestant
as
so
many
of
your
enemies
whisper
to
each
it
is
my
hope
my
lord
that
our
merciful
god
will
keep
me
to
the
end
of
my
life
a
dutiful
and
faithful
priest
of
our
holy
church
however
i
can
not
conceal
from
your
lordship
that
my
faith
was
terribly
shaken
last
night
as
a
bishop
your
portion
of
light
and
wisdom
must
be
greater
than
mine
i
hope
you
will
grant
me
some
of
the
lights
which
still
brightly
shine
before
your
eyes
i
have
never
been
so
much
in
need
of
the
counsels
of
your
piety
and
the
help
of
your
spiritual
knowledge
as
please
help
me
to
come
out
from
the
intellectual
slough
in
which
i
spent
the
night
your
lordship
has
congratulated
me
for
having
said
that
jesus
christ
has
always
granted
the
petitions
of
mary
please
tell
me
how
you
reconcile
that
proposition
with
this
text
and
i
handed
him
the
gospel
of
matthew
pointing
to
the
last
five
verses
of
the
twelfth
chapter
i
requested
him
to
read
them
he
read
them
and
said
now
what
do
you
want
from
me
my
lord
i
want
respectfully
to
ask
you
how
can
we
say
that
jesus
has
always
granted
the
requests
of
his
mother
when
this
evangelist
tells
us
that
he
never
granted
her
petitions
when
acting
in
his
capacity
of
saviour
of
the
world
must
we
not
fear
that
we
proclaim
a
blasphemous
falsehood
when
we
support
a
proposition
directly
opposed
to
the
gospel
the
poor
bishop
seemed
absolutely
confounded
by
this
simple
and
honest
question
i
also
felt
confused
and
sorry
for
his
humiliation
beginning
a
phrase
he
would
give
it
up
trying
arguments
he
could
not
push
to
their
conclusion
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
never
read
that
text
or
if
he
had
read
it
he
like
myself
and
the
rest
of
the
priests
of
rome
had
never
noted
that
they
entirely
demolish
the
stupendous
impostures
of
the
church
in
reference
to
the
worship
of
mary
in
order
to
help
him
out
of
the
inextricable
difficulties
into
which
i
had
once
pushed
him
i
said
my
lord
will
you
allow
me
to
put
a
few
more
questions
to
you
with
pleasure
he
answered
well
my
lord
who
came
to
this
world
to
save
you
and
me
is
it
jesus
or
mary
it
is
jesus
answered
the
bishop
who
was
called
and
is
in
reality
the
sinner
s
best
friend
was
it
jesus
or
mary
the
bishop
answered
it
was
now
please
allow
me
a
few
more
when
jesus
and
mary
were
on
earth
whose
heart
was
most
devoted
to
sinners
who
loved
them
with
a
more
efficacious
and
saving
love
was
it
jesus
or
mary
jesus
being
god
his
love
was
evidently
more
efficacious
and
saving
than
mary
s
answered
the
bishop
in
the
days
of
jesus
and
mary
to
whom
did
jesus
invite
sinners
to
go
for
their
salvation
was
it
to
himself
or
mary
i
asked
again
the
bishop
answered
jesus
has
said
to
all
sinners
come
unto
he
never
said
come
or
go
to
have
we
any
examples
in
the
scriptures
of
sinners
who
fearing
to
be
rebuked
by
jesus
have
gone
to
mary
and
obtained
access
to
him
through
her
and
been
saved
through
her
intercessions
i
do
not
remember
of
any
such
cases
replied
the
bishop
i
then
asked
to
whom
did
the
penitent
thief
on
the
cross
address
himself
to
be
saved
was
it
to
jesus
or
to
mary
it
was
to
jesus
replied
the
bishop
did
that
penitent
thief
do
well
to
address
himself
to
jesus
on
the
cross
rather
than
to
mary
who
was
at
his
feet
said
i
surely
he
did
better
answered
the
bishop
now
my
lord
allow
me
only
one
question
more
you
told
me
that
jesus
loved
sinners
when
on
earth
infinitely
more
than
mary
that
he
was
infinitely
more
their
true
friend
than
she
was
that
he
infinitely
took
more
interest
in
their
salvation
than
mary
that
it
was
infinitely
better
for
sinners
to
go
to
jesus
than
to
mary
to
be
saved
will
you
please
tell
me
if
you
think
that
jesus
has
lost
in
heaven
since
he
is
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
his
father
any
of
his
divine
and
infinite
superiority
of
love
and
mercy
over
mary
for
sinners
and
can
you
show
me
that
what
jesus
has
lost
has
been
gained
by
mary
i
do
not
think
that
christ
has
lost
any
of
his
love
and
power
to
save
us
now
that
he
is
in
heaven
answered
the
bishop
now
my
lord
if
jesus
is
still
my
best
friend
my
most
powerful
merciful
and
loving
friend
why
should
i
not
go
directly
to
him
why
should
we
for
a
moment
go
to
any
one
who
is
infinitely
inferior
in
power
love
and
mercy
for
our
salvation
the
bishop
was
stunned
by
my
questions
he
stammered
some
unintelligible
answer
excused
himself
for
not
being
able
to
remain
any
longer
on
account
of
some
pressing
business
and
extending
his
hand
to
me
before
leaving
he
said
you
will
find
an
answer
to
your
questions
and
difficulties
in
the
holy
can
you
lend
me
the
holy
fathers
my
lord
he
replied
no
sir
i
have
them
this
last
answer
from
my
bishop
shook
my
faith
to
its
foundation
and
left
my
mind
in
a
state
of
great
distress
with
the
sincere
hope
of
finding
in
the
holy
fathers
some
explanations
which
would
dispel
my
painful
doubts
i
immediately
went
to
fabre
the
great
bookseller
of
montreal
who
got
me
from
france
the
splendid
edition
of
the
holy
fathers
by
migne
i
studied
with
the
utmost
attention
every
page
where
i
might
find
what
they
taught
of
the
worship
of
mary
and
the
doctrines
that
jesus
had
never
refused
any
of
her
prayers
what
was
my
desolation
my
shame
and
my
surprise
to
find
that
the
holy
fathers
of
the
first
six
centuries
had
never
advocated
the
worship
of
mary
and
that
the
many
eloquent
pages
on
the
power
of
mary
in
heaven
and
her
love
for
sinners
found
in
every
page
of
my
theologians
and
other
ascetic
books
i
had
read
till
then
were
but
impudent
lies
additions
interpolated
in
their
works
a
hundred
years
after
their
death
when
discovering
these
forgeries
under
the
name
of
the
holy
fathers
of
which
my
church
was
guilty
how
many
times
in
the
silence
of
my
long
nights
of
study
and
prayerful
meditations
did
i
hear
a
voice
telling
me
come
out
of
but
where
could
i
go
out
of
the
church
of
rome
where
could
i
find
that
salvation
which
was
to
be
found
only
within
her
walls
i
said
to
myself
surely
there
are
some
errors
in
my
dear
the
dust
of
ages
may
have
fallen
on
the
precious
gold
of
her
treasures
but
will
i
not
find
still
more
damnable
errors
among
those
hundreds
of
protestant
churches
which
under
the
name
of
episcopalians
presbyterians
baptists
methodists
are
divided
and
into
scores
of
contemptible
sects
anathematizing
and
denouncing
each
other
before
the
world
my
ideas
of
the
great
family
of
evangelical
churches
comprised
under
the
broad
name
of
protestantism
were
so
exaggerated
then
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
me
to
find
in
them
that
unity
which
i
considered
the
essentials
of
the
church
of
christ
the
hour
was
not
yet
come
but
it
was
coming
fast
when
my
dear
saviour
would
make
me
understand
his
sublime
words
i
am
the
vine
and
ye
are
the
it
was
some
time
later
when
under
the
beautiful
vine
i
had
planted
in
my
own
garden
and
which
i
had
cultivated
with
mine
own
hands
i
saw
that
there
was
not
a
single
branch
like
another
in
that
prolific
vine
some
branches
were
very
big
some
very
thin
some
very
long
some
very
short
some
going
up
some
going
down
some
straight
as
an
arrow
some
crooked
as
a
flash
of
lightning
some
turning
to
the
west
some
to
the
east
some
to
the
north
and
others
to
the
south
but
although
the
branches
were
so
different
from
each
other
in
so
many
things
they
all
gave
me
excellent
fruit
so
long
as
they
remained
united
to
the
vine
chapter
xlvi
the
holy
mental
troubles
at
not
finding
the
doctrines
of
my
church
in
their
and
the
sucking
pig
of
the
poor
man
of
varennes
the
most
desolate
work
of
a
sincere
catholic
priest
is
the
study
of
the
holy
fathers
he
does
not
make
a
step
in
the
labyrinth
of
their
discussions
and
controversies
without
seeing
the
dreams
of
his
theological
studies
and
religious
views
disappear
as
the
thick
morning
mist
when
the
sun
rises
above
the
horizon
bound
as
he
is
by
a
solemn
oath
to
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
only
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
the
first
thing
which
puzzles
and
distresses
him
is
their
absolute
want
of
unanimity
on
the
greater
part
of
the
subjects
which
they
discuss
the
fact
is
that
more
than
of
what
one
father
has
written
is
to
prove
that
what
some
other
holy
father
has
written
is
wrong
and
heretical
the
student
of
the
fathers
not
only
detects
that
they
do
not
agree
with
one
another
but
finds
that
many
of
them
do
not
even
agree
with
themselves
very
often
they
confess
that
they
were
mistaken
when
they
said
this
and
that
that
they
have
lately
changed
their
minds
that
they
now
hold
for
saving
truth
what
they
formerly
condemned
as
damnable
error
what
becomes
of
the
solemn
oath
of
every
priest
in
presence
of
this
undeniable
fact
how
can
he
make
an
act
of
faith
when
he
feels
that
its
foundation
is
nothing
but
falsehood
no
words
can
give
an
idea
of
the
mental
tortures
i
felt
when
i
saw
positively
that
i
could
not
any
longer
preach
on
the
eternity
of
the
suffering
of
the
damned
nor
believe
in
the
real
presence
of
the
body
soul
and
divinity
of
christ
in
the
sacrament
of
communion
nor
in
the
supremacy
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
of
rome
nor
in
any
of
the
other
dogmas
of
the
church
without
perjuring
myself
for
there
was
not
one
of
those
dogmas
which
had
not
been
flatly
and
directly
denied
by
some
holy
fathers
it
is
true
that
in
my
roman
catholic
theological
books
i
had
long
extracts
of
holy
fathers
very
clearly
supporting
and
confirming
my
faith
in
these
dogmas
for
instance
i
had
the
apostolic
liturgies
of
peter
mark
and
james
to
prove
that
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
purgatory
prayers
for
the
dead
transubstantiation
were
believed
and
taught
from
the
very
days
of
the
apostles
but
what
was
my
dismay
when
i
discovered
that
those
liturgies
were
nothing
else
than
vile
and
audacious
forgeries
presented
to
the
world
by
my
popes
and
my
church
as
gospel
truths
i
could
not
find
words
to
express
my
sense
of
shame
and
consternation
when
i
became
sure
that
the
same
church
which
had
invented
these
apostolic
liturgies
had
accepted
and
circulated
the
false
decretals
of
isidore
and
forged
innumerable
additions
and
interpolations
to
the
writings
of
the
holy
fathers
in
order
to
make
them
say
the
very
contrary
of
what
they
intended
how
many
times
when
alone
studying
the
history
of
the
shameless
fabrications
i
said
to
myself
does
the
man
whose
treasury
is
filled
with
pure
gold
forge
false
coins
or
spurious
pieces
of
money
no
how
then
is
it
possible
that
my
church
does
possess
the
pure
truth
when
she
has
been
at
work
during
so
many
centuries
to
forge
such
egregious
lies
under
the
names
of
liturgies
and
decretals
about
the
holy
mass
purgatory
the
supremacy
of
the
pope
if
those
dogmas
could
have
been
proved
by
the
gospel
and
the
true
writings
of
the
fathers
where
was
the
necessity
of
forging
lying
documents
would
the
popes
and
councils
have
treasuries
with
spurious
bank
bills
if
they
had
had
exhaustless
mines
of
pure
gold
in
hand
what
right
has
my
church
to
be
called
holy
and
infallible
when
she
is
publicly
guilty
of
such
impostures
from
my
infancy
i
had
been
taught
with
all
the
roman
catholics
that
mary
is
the
mother
of
god
and
many
times
every
day
when
praying
to
her
i
used
to
say
holy
mary
mother
of
god
pray
for
but
what
was
my
distress
when
i
read
in
the
treatise
on
faith
and
creed
by
st
augustine
chapter
these
very
words
when
the
lord
said
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
mine
hour
is
not
yet
john
xix
he
rather
admonishes
us
to
understand
that
in
respect
of
his
being
god
there
was
no
mother
for
him
this
was
so
completely
demolishing
the
teachings
of
my
church
and
telling
me
that
it
was
blasphemy
to
call
mary
mother
of
god
that
i
felt
as
if
struck
with
a
thunderbolt
several
volumes
might
be
written
if
my
plan
were
to
give
the
story
of
my
mental
agonies
when
reading
the
holy
fathers
i
found
their
furious
battles
against
each
other
and
reviewed
their
fierce
divisions
on
almost
every
subject
the
horror
of
many
of
them
at
the
dogmas
which
my
church
had
taught
to
make
me
believe
from
my
infancy
as
the
most
solemn
and
sacred
revelations
of
god
to
man
such
as
transubstantiation
auricular
confession
purgatory
the
supremacy
of
peter
the
absolute
supremacy
of
the
pope
over
the
whole
church
of
christ
yes
what
thrilling
pages
i
would
give
to
the
world
were
it
my
intention
to
portray
in
their
true
colors
the
dark
clouds
the
flashing
lights
and
destructive
storms
which
during
the
long
and
silent
hours
of
the
many
nights
i
spent
in
comparing
the
fathers
with
the
word
of
god
and
the
teachings
of
my
church
their
fierce
and
constant
conflicts
their
unexpected
though
undeniable
opposition
to
many
of
the
articles
of
the
faith
i
had
to
believe
and
preach
were
coming
to
me
day
after
day
as
the
barbed
darts
thrown
at
the
doomed
whale
when
coming
out
of
the
dark
regions
of
the
deep
to
see
the
light
and
breathe
the
pure
air
thus
as
the
unexpected
contradictions
of
the
holy
fathers
to
the
tenets
of
my
church
and
their
furious
and
uncharitable
divisions
among
themselves
were
striking
me
i
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
deep
waters
of
the
fathers
and
the
word
of
god
with
the
hope
of
getting
rid
of
the
deadly
darts
which
were
piercing
my
roman
catholic
conscience
but
it
was
in
vain
the
deeper
i
went
the
more
the
deadly
weapons
would
stick
to
the
flesh
and
bone
of
my
soul
how
deep
was
the
wound
i
received
from
gregory
the
great
one
of
the
most
learned
popes
of
rome
against
supremacy
and
universality
of
the
power
of
the
pope
of
rome
as
taught
the
following
extracts
from
his
writings
will
show
but
i
confidently
say
that
whosoever
calls
himself
universal
bishop
or
desires
to
be
called
so
in
his
pride
he
prefers
himself
to
the
rest
and
he
is
led
to
error
with
a
similar
pride
for
as
that
wicked
one
wishes
to
appear
a
god
above
all
men
whosoever
he
is
who
alone
desires
to
be
called
a
supreme
bishop
extols
himself
above
the
other
bk
vii
int
epist
to
maurituus
augustus
these
words
wounded
me
very
painfully
i
showed
them
to
brassard
saying
do
you
not
see
here
the
incontrovertible
proof
of
what
i
have
told
you
many
times
that
during
the
first
six
centuries
of
christianity
we
do
not
find
the
least
proof
that
there
was
anything
like
our
dogma
of
the
supreme
power
and
authority
of
the
bishop
of
rome
or
any
other
bishop
over
the
rest
of
the
christian
world
if
there
is
anything
which
comes
to
the
mind
with
an
irresistible
force
when
reading
the
fathers
of
the
first
centuries
it
is
that
not
one
of
them
had
any
idea
that
there
was
in
the
church
any
man
chosen
by
god
to
be
in
fact
or
name
the
universal
and
supreme
pontiff
with
such
an
undeniable
fact
before
us
how
can
we
believe
and
say
that
the
religion
we
profess
and
teach
is
the
same
which
was
preached
from
the
beginning
of
christianity
my
dear
chiniquy
answered
brassard
did
i
not
tell
you
when
you
bought
the
holy
fathers
that
you
were
doing
a
foolish
and
dangerous
thing
in
every
age
the
man
who
singularises
himself
and
walks
out
of
the
common
tracks
of
life
is
subject
to
fall
into
ridicule
as
you
are
the
only
priest
in
canada
who
has
the
holy
fathers
it
is
thought
and
said
in
many
quarters
that
it
is
through
pride
you
got
them
that
it
is
to
raise
yourself
above
the
rest
of
the
clergy
that
you
study
them
not
only
at
home
but
that
you
carry
some
wherever
you
go
i
see
with
regret
that
you
are
fast
losing
ground
in
the
mind
not
only
of
the
bishop
but
of
the
priests
in
general
on
account
of
your
indomitable
perseverance
in
giving
all
your
spare
time
in
their
study
you
are
also
too
free
and
imprudent
in
speaking
of
what
you
call
the
contradictions
of
the
holy
fathers
and
their
want
of
harmony
with
some
of
our
religious
views
many
say
that
this
too
great
application
to
study
without
a
moment
of
relaxation
will
upset
your
intelligence
and
trouble
your
mind
they
even
whisper
that
there
is
danger
ahead
for
your
faith
which
you
do
not
suspect
and
that
they
would
not
be
surprised
if
the
reading
of
the
bible
and
the
holy
fathers
would
drive
you
into
the
abyss
of
protestantism
i
know
that
that
they
are
mistaken
and
i
do
all
in
my
power
to
defend
you
but
i
thought
as
your
most
devoted
friend
that
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
you
those
things
and
warn
you
before
it
is
too
i
replied
bishop
prince
told
me
the
very
same
things
and
i
will
give
you
the
answer
he
got
from
me
when
you
ordain
a
priest
do
you
not
make
him
swear
that
he
will
never
interpret
the
holy
scriptures
except
according
to
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
ought
you
not
then
to
know
what
they
teach
for
how
can
we
know
their
unanimous
consent
without
studying
them
is
it
not
more
than
strange
that
not
only
the
priests
do
not
study
the
holy
fathers
but
the
only
one
in
canada
who
is
trying
to
study
them
is
turned
into
ridicule
and
suspected
of
heresy
is
it
my
fault
if
that
precious
stone
called
consent
of
the
holy
fathers
which
is
the
very
foundation
of
our
religious
belief
and
teachings
is
to
be
found
nowhere
in
them
is
it
my
fault
if
origen
never
believed
in
the
eternal
punishment
of
the
damned
if
cyprien
denied
the
supreme
authority
of
the
bishop
of
rome
if
augustine
positively
said
that
nobody
was
obliged
to
believe
in
purgatory
if
john
chrysostom
publicly
denied
the
obligations
of
auricular
confession
and
the
real
presence
of
the
body
of
christ
in
the
eucharist
is
it
my
fault
if
one
of
the
most
learned
and
holy
popes
gregory
the
great
has
called
by
the
name
of
antichrist
all
his
successors
for
taking
the
name
of
supreme
pontiff
and
trying
to
persuade
the
world
that
they
had
by
divine
authority
a
supreme
jurisdiction
and
power
over
the
rest
of
the
church
and
what
did
bishop
prince
answer
you
rejoined
brassard
just
as
you
did
by
expressing
his
fears
that
my
too
great
application
to
the
study
of
the
bible
and
the
holy
fathers
would
either
send
me
to
the
lunatic
asylum
or
drive
me
into
the
bottomless
abyss
of
i
answered
him
in
a
jocose
way
that
if
the
too
great
study
of
the
bible
and
the
holy
fathers
were
to
open
me
the
gates
of
the
lunatic
asylum
i
feared
i
would
be
left
alone
there
for
i
know
that
they
are
keeping
themselves
at
a
respectable
distance
from
those
dangerous
i
added
seriously
so
long
as
god
keeps
my
intelligence
sound
i
can
not
join
protestants
for
the
numberless
and
ridiculous
sects
of
these
heretics
are
a
sure
antidote
against
their
poisonous
errors
i
will
not
remain
a
good
catholic
on
account
of
the
unanimity
of
the
holy
fathers
which
does
not
exist
but
i
will
remain
a
catholic
on
account
of
the
grand
and
visible
unanimity
of
the
prophets
apostles
and
the
evangelists
with
jesus
christ
my
faith
will
not
be
founded
upon
the
fallible
obscure
and
wavering
words
of
origen
tertullian
chrysostom
augustine
or
jerome
but
on
the
infallible
word
of
jesus
the
son
of
god
and
his
inspired
writers
matthew
mark
luke
john
peter
james
and
paul
it
is
jesus
not
origen
who
will
now
guide
me
for
the
second
was
a
sinner
like
myself
and
the
first
is
forever
my
saviour
and
my
god
i
know
enough
of
the
holy
fathers
to
assure
your
lordship
that
the
oath
we
take
accepting
the
word
of
god
according
to
their
unanimous
consent
is
a
miserable
blunder
if
not
a
blasphemous
perjury
it
is
evident
that
pius
who
imposed
the
obligation
of
that
oath
upon
us
all
never
read
a
single
volume
of
the
holy
fathers
he
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
such
an
incredible
blunder
if
he
had
known
that
the
holy
fathers
are
unanimous
in
only
one
thing
which
is
to
differ
from
each
other
on
almost
everything
except
we
suppose
that
like
the
last
pope
he
was
too
fond
of
good
champagne
and
that
he
wrote
that
ordinance
after
a
luxurious
i
spoke
this
last
sentence
in
a
and
way
the
bishop
answered
who
told
you
that
about
our
last
pope
your
lordship
i
answered
told
me
that
when
you
complimented
me
on
the
apostolical
benediction
which
the
present
pope
sent
me
through
my
lord
baillargeon
that
his
predecessor
would
not
have
given
me
his
benediction
for
preaching
temperance
because
he
was
too
fond
of
wine
oh
yes
yes
i
remember
it
now
answered
the
bishop
but
it
was
a
bad
joke
on
my
part
which
i
good
or
bad
joke
i
replied
it
is
not
the
less
the
fact
that
our
last
pope
was
too
fond
of
wine
there
is
not
a
single
priest
of
canada
who
has
gone
to
rome
without
bringing
that
back
as
a
public
fact
from
and
what
did
my
lord
prince
say
to
that
asked
again
brassard
just
as
when
he
was
cornered
by
me
on
the
subject
of
the
virgin
mary
he
abruptly
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
by
looking
at
his
watch
and
saying
that
he
had
a
call
to
make
at
that
very
not
long
after
that
painful
conversation
about
the
holy
fathers
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
a
new
arrow
should
be
thrust
into
my
roman
catholic
conscience
which
went
through
and
through
in
spite
of
myself
i
had
been
invited
to
give
a
course
of
three
sermons
at
varennes
the
second
day
at
tea
time
after
preaching
and
hearing
confessions
for
the
whole
afternoon
i
was
coming
from
the
church
with
the
curate
when
to
the
parsonage
we
were
met
by
a
poor
man
who
looked
more
like
one
coming
out
of
the
grave
than
a
living
man
he
was
covered
with
rags
and
his
pale
and
trembling
lips
indicated
that
he
was
reduced
to
the
last
degree
of
human
misery
taking
off
his
hat
through
respect
for
us
he
said
to
rev
primeau
with
a
trembling
voice
you
know
le
cure
that
my
poor
wife
died
and
was
buried
ten
days
ago
but
i
was
too
poor
to
have
a
funeral
service
sung
the
day
she
was
buried
and
i
fear
she
is
in
purgatory
for
almost
every
night
i
see
her
in
my
dreams
wrapped
up
in
burning
flames
she
cries
to
me
for
help
and
asks
me
to
have
a
high
mass
sung
for
the
rest
of
her
soul
i
come
to
ask
you
to
be
so
kind
as
to
sing
that
high
mass
for
of
course
answered
the
curate
your
wife
is
in
the
flames
of
purgatory
and
suffers
there
the
most
unspeakable
tortures
which
can
be
relieved
only
by
the
offering
of
the
holy
sacrifice
of
mass
give
me
five
dollars
and
i
will
sing
that
mass
you
know
very
well
le
cure
answered
the
poor
man
in
a
most
supplicating
tone
that
my
wife
has
been
sick
as
well
as
myself
a
good
part
of
the
year
i
am
too
poor
to
give
you
five
dollars
if
you
can
not
pay
you
can
not
have
any
mass
sung
you
know
it
is
the
rule
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
change
these
words
were
said
by
the
curate
with
a
high
and
unfeeling
tone
which
were
in
absolute
contrast
with
the
solemnity
and
distress
of
the
poor
sick
man
they
made
a
very
painful
impression
upon
me
for
i
felt
for
him
i
knew
the
curate
was
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
richest
parishes
of
canada
that
he
had
several
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
i
hoped
at
first
that
he
would
kindly
grant
the
petition
presented
to
him
without
speaking
of
the
pay
but
i
was
disappointed
my
first
thought
after
hearing
his
hard
rebuke
was
to
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
take
one
of
the
several
gold
pieces
i
had
and
give
it
to
the
poor
man
that
he
might
be
relieved
from
his
terrible
anxiety
about
his
wife
it
came
also
to
my
mind
to
say
to
him
i
will
sing
your
high
mass
for
nothing
but
alas
i
must
confess
to
my
shame
i
was
too
cowardly
to
do
that
noble
deed
i
had
a
sincere
desire
to
do
it
but
was
prevented
by
the
fear
of
insulting
that
priest
who
was
older
than
myself
and
for
whom
i
had
always
entertained
great
respect
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
would
have
taken
my
action
as
a
condemnation
of
his
conduct
when
i
was
feeling
ashamed
of
my
own
cowardice
and
still
more
indignant
against
myself
than
against
the
curate
he
said
to
the
disconcerted
poor
man
that
woman
is
your
wife
not
mine
it
is
your
business
and
not
mine
to
see
how
to
get
her
out
of
turning
to
me
he
said
in
the
most
amiable
way
please
sir
come
to
we
hardly
started
when
the
poor
man
raising
his
voice
said
in
a
most
touching
way
i
can
not
leave
my
poor
wife
in
the
flames
of
purgatory
if
you
can
not
sing
a
high
mass
will
you
please
say
five
low
masses
to
rescue
her
soul
from
those
burning
flames
the
priest
turned
towards
him
and
said
yes
i
can
say
five
masses
to
take
the
soul
of
your
wife
out
of
purgatory
but
give
me
five
shillings
for
you
know
the
price
of
a
low
mass
is
one
the
poor
man
answered
i
can
no
more
give
one
dollar
than
i
can
five
i
have
not
a
cent
and
my
three
poor
little
children
are
as
naked
and
starving
as
well
well
answered
the
curate
when
i
passed
this
morning
before
your
house
i
saw
two
beautiful
sucking
pigs
give
me
one
of
them
and
i
will
say
your
five
low
the
poor
man
said
these
small
pigs
were
given
me
by
a
charitable
neighbor
that
i
might
raise
them
to
feed
my
poor
children
next
winter
they
will
surely
starve
to
death
if
i
give
my
pigs
but
i
could
not
listen
any
longer
to
that
strange
dialogue
every
word
of
which
fell
upon
my
soul
as
a
shower
of
burning
coals
i
was
beside
myself
with
shame
and
disgust
i
abruptly
left
the
merchant
of
souls
finishing
his
bargains
went
to
my
locked
the
door
and
fell
upon
my
knees
to
weep
to
my
heart
s
content
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
curate
knocked
at
my
door
and
said
tea
is
ready
please
come
down
i
answered
i
am
not
well
i
want
some
rest
please
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
take
my
tea
it
would
require
a
more
eloquent
pen
than
mine
to
give
the
correct
history
of
that
sleepless
night
the
hours
were
dark
and
long
my
god
my
god
i
cried
a
thousand
times
is
it
possible
that
in
my
so
dear
church
of
rome
there
can
be
such
abominations
as
i
have
seen
and
heard
dear
and
adorable
saviour
if
thou
wert
still
on
earth
and
should
see
the
soul
of
a
daughter
of
israel
fallen
into
a
burning
furnace
wouldst
thou
ask
a
shilling
to
take
it
out
wouldst
thou
force
the
poor
father
with
his
starving
children
to
give
their
last
morsel
of
bread
to
persuade
thee
to
extinguish
the
burning
flames
thou
hast
shed
the
last
drop
of
thy
blood
to
save
her
and
how
cruel
how
merciless
we
thy
priests
are
for
the
same
precious
soul
but
are
we
really
thy
priests
is
it
not
blasphemous
to
call
ourselves
thy
priests
when
not
only
we
will
not
sacrifice
anything
to
save
that
soul
but
will
starve
the
poor
husband
and
his
orphans
what
right
have
we
to
extort
such
sums
of
money
from
thy
poor
children
to
help
them
out
of
purgatory
do
not
thy
apostles
say
that
thy
blood
alone
can
purify
the
soul
is
it
possible
that
there
is
such
a
fiery
prison
for
the
sinners
after
death
and
that
neither
thyself
nor
any
of
thy
apostles
has
said
a
word
about
it
several
of
the
fathers
consider
purgatory
as
of
pagan
origin
tertullian
spoke
of
it
only
after
he
had
joined
the
sect
of
the
montanists
and
he
confesses
that
it
is
not
through
the
holy
scriptures
but
through
the
inspiration
of
the
paraclete
of
montanus
that
he
knows
anything
about
purgatory
augustine
the
most
learned
and
pious
of
the
holy
fathers
does
not
find
purgatory
in
the
bible
and
positively
says
that
its
existence
is
dubious
that
every
one
may
believe
what
he
thinks
proper
about
it
is
it
possible
that
i
am
so
mean
as
to
have
refused
to
extend
a
helping
hand
to
that
poor
distressed
man
for
fear
of
offending
the
cruel
priest
we
priests
believe
and
say
that
we
can
help
souls
out
of
the
burning
furnace
of
purgatory
by
our
prayers
and
masses
but
instead
of
rushing
to
their
rescue
we
turn
to
the
parents
friends
the
children
of
those
departed
souls
and
say
give
me
five
dollars
give
me
a
shilling
and
i
will
put
an
end
to
those
tortures
but
if
you
refuse
us
that
money
we
will
let
your
father
husband
wife
child
or
friend
endure
those
tortures
hundreds
of
years
more
would
not
the
people
throw
us
into
the
river
if
they
could
once
understand
the
extent
of
our
meanness
and
avarice
ought
we
not
to
be
ashamed
to
ask
a
shilling
to
take
out
of
the
fire
a
human
being
who
calls
us
to
the
rescue
who
except
a
priest
can
descend
so
low
in
the
regions
of
depravity
it
would
take
too
long
to
give
the
thoughts
which
tortured
me
during
that
terrible
night
i
literally
bathed
my
pillow
with
my
tears
before
saying
my
mass
next
morning
i
went
to
confess
my
criminal
cowardice
and
want
of
charity
towards
that
poor
man
and
also
the
terrible
temptation
against
my
faith
which
tortured
my
conscience
during
the
long
hours
of
that
night
and
i
repaired
my
cowardice
by
giving
to
that
poor
man
i
spent
the
morning
in
hearing
confessions
till
ten
o
clock
when
i
delivered
a
very
exciting
sermon
on
the
malice
of
sin
proved
by
the
sufferings
of
christ
on
the
cross
this
address
gave
a
happy
diversion
to
my
mind
and
made
me
forget
the
sad
story
of
the
sucking
pig
after
the
sermon
the
curate
took
me
by
the
hand
to
his
dining
room
where
he
gave
me
in
spite
of
myself
the
place
of
honor
he
had
the
reputation
of
having
one
of
the
best
cooks
of
canada
in
the
widow
of
one
of
the
governors
of
nova
scotia
whom
he
had
as
his
housekeeper
the
dishes
before
our
eyes
did
not
diminish
his
good
reputation
the
first
dish
was
a
sucking
pig
roasted
with
an
art
and
perfection
as
i
had
never
seen
it
looked
like
a
piece
of
pure
gold
and
its
smell
would
have
brought
water
to
the
lips
of
the
most
penitent
anchorite
i
had
not
tasted
anything
for
the
last
hours
had
preached
two
exciting
sermons
and
spent
six
hours
in
hearing
confessions
i
felt
hungry
and
the
sucking
pig
was
the
most
tempting
thing
to
me
it
was
a
real
epicurean
pleasure
to
look
at
it
and
smell
its
fragrance
besides
that
was
a
favorite
dish
with
me
i
can
not
conceal
that
it
was
with
real
pleasure
that
i
saw
the
curate
after
sharpening
his
long
glittering
knife
on
the
file
cutting
a
beautiful
slice
from
the
shoulder
and
offering
it
to
me
i
was
too
hungry
to
be
over
patient
my
knife
and
fork
had
soon
done
their
work
i
was
carrying
to
my
mouth
the
tempting
and
succulent
mouthful
when
suddenly
the
remembrance
of
the
poor
man
s
sucking
pig
came
to
my
mind
i
laid
the
piece
on
my
plate
and
with
painful
anxiety
looked
at
the
curate
and
said
will
you
allow
me
to
put
you
a
question
about
this
dish
oh
yes
ask
me
not
only
one
but
two
questions
and
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
answered
he
with
his
fine
manners
is
this
the
sucking
pig
of
the
poor
man
of
yesterday
i
asked
with
a
convulsive
fit
of
laughter
he
replied
yes
it
is
just
it
if
we
can
not
take
away
the
soul
of
the
poor
woman
out
of
the
flames
of
purgatory
we
will
at
all
events
eat
a
fine
sucking
pig
the
other
thirteen
priests
filled
the
room
with
laughter
to
show
their
appreciation
of
their
host
s
wit
however
their
laughter
was
not
of
long
duration
with
a
feeling
of
shame
and
uncontrollable
indignation
i
pushed
away
my
plate
with
such
force
that
it
crossed
the
table
and
nearly
fell
on
the
floor
saying
with
a
sentiment
of
disgust
which
no
pen
can
describe
i
would
rather
starve
to
death
than
eat
of
that
execrable
dish
i
see
in
it
the
tears
of
the
poor
man
i
see
the
blood
of
his
starving
children
it
is
the
price
of
a
soul
no
no
gentlemen
do
not
touch
it
you
know
curate
how
priests
and
monks
were
slaughtered
in
france
in
the
bloody
days
of
it
was
for
such
iniquities
as
this
that
god
almighty
visited
the
church
in
france
the
same
future
awaits
us
here
in
canada
the
very
day
that
people
will
awaken
from
their
slumber
and
see
that
instead
of
being
ministers
of
christ
we
are
vile
traders
of
souls
under
the
mask
of
the
poor
curate
stunned
by
the
solemnity
of
my
words
as
well
as
by
the
consciousness
of
his
guilt
lisped
some
excuse
the
sucking
pig
remained
untouched
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
had
more
the
appearance
of
a
burial
ceremony
than
of
a
convivial
repast
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
had
redeemed
my
cowardice
of
the
day
before
but
i
had
mortally
wounded
the
feelings
of
that
curate
and
his
friends
and
forever
lost
their
it
is
in
such
ways
that
god
was
directing
the
steps
of
his
unprofitable
servant
through
ways
unknown
to
him
furious
storms
were
constantly
blowing
around
my
fragile
bark
and
tearing
my
sails
into
fragments
but
every
storm
was
pushing
me
in
spite
of
myself
towards
the
shores
of
eternal
life
where
i
was
to
land
safely
a
few
years
later
chapter
xlvii
letter
from
the
rev
bishop
vandeveld
of
project
of
the
bishops
of
the
united
states
to
take
possession
of
the
rich
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
prairies
of
the
west
to
rule
that
great
want
to
put
me
at
the
head
of
the
lectures
on
temperance
at
of
the
bishop
and
priests
of
that
city
on
the
of
december
i
received
the
following
letter
chicago
rev
father
chiniquy
apostle
of
temperance
of
canada
dear
sir
i
was
in
canada
last
fall
i
intended
to
confer
with
you
on
a
very
important
subject
but
you
were
then
working
in
the
diocese
of
boston
and
my
limited
time
prevented
me
from
going
so
far
to
meet
you
you
are
aware
that
the
lands
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
whole
valley
of
the
mississippi
are
among
the
richest
and
most
fertile
of
the
world
in
a
near
future
those
regions
which
are
now
a
comparative
wilderness
will
be
the
granary
not
only
of
the
united
states
but
of
the
whole
world
and
those
who
will
possess
them
will
not
only
possess
the
very
heart
and
arteries
of
this
young
and
already
so
great
republic
but
will
become
its
rulers
it
is
our
intention
without
noise
to
take
possession
of
those
vast
and
magnificent
regions
of
the
west
in
the
name
and
for
the
benefit
of
our
holy
church
our
plan
to
attain
that
object
is
as
sure
as
easy
there
is
every
year
an
increasing
tide
of
emigration
from
the
roman
catholic
regions
of
europe
and
canada
towards
the
united
states
unfortunately
till
now
our
emigrants
have
blindly
scattered
themselves
among
the
protestant
populations
which
too
often
absorb
them
and
destroy
their
faith
why
should
we
not
direct
their
steps
to
the
same
spot
why
should
we
not
for
instance
induce
them
to
come
and
take
possession
of
these
fertile
states
of
illinois
missouri
iowa
kansas
etc
they
can
get
those
lands
now
at
a
nominal
price
if
we
succeed
as
i
hope
we
will
our
holy
church
will
soon
count
her
children
here
by
ten
and
twenty
millions
and
through
their
numbers
their
wealth
and
unity
they
will
have
such
a
weight
in
the
balance
of
power
that
they
will
rule
everything
the
protestants
always
divided
among
themselves
will
never
form
any
strong
party
without
the
help
of
the
united
vote
of
our
catholic
people
and
that
party
alone
which
will
ask
and
get
our
help
by
yielding
to
our
just
demands
will
rule
the
country
then
in
reality
though
not
in
appearance
our
holy
church
will
rule
the
united
states
as
she
is
called
by
our
saviour
himself
to
rule
the
whole
world
there
is
a
wave
of
emigration
from
canada
towards
the
united
states
which
if
not
stopped
or
well
directed
is
threatening
to
throw
the
good
french
canadian
people
into
the
mire
of
protestantism
your
countrymen
when
once
mixed
with
the
numberless
sects
which
try
to
attract
them
are
soon
shaken
in
their
faith
their
children
sent
to
protestant
schools
will
be
unable
to
defend
themselves
against
the
wily
and
united
efforts
made
to
pervert
them
but
put
yourself
at
the
head
of
the
emigrants
from
canada
france
and
belgium
prevent
them
from
settling
any
longer
among
the
protestants
by
inducing
them
to
follow
you
to
illinois
and
with
them
you
will
soon
see
here
a
roman
catholic
people
whose
number
wealth
and
influence
will
amaze
the
world
god
almighty
has
wonderfully
blessed
your
labors
in
canada
in
that
holy
cause
of
temperance
but
now
the
work
is
done
the
same
great
god
presents
to
your
christian
ambition
a
not
less
great
and
noble
work
for
the
rest
of
your
life
make
use
of
your
great
influence
over
your
countrymen
to
prevent
them
from
scattering
any
longer
among
protestants
by
inducing
them
to
come
here
in
illinois
you
will
then
lay
the
foundation
of
a
roman
catholic
french
people
whose
piety
unity
wealth
and
number
will
soon
renew
and
revive
on
this
continent
the
past
and
fading
glories
of
the
church
of
france
we
have
already
at
bourbonnais
a
fine
colony
of
french
canadians
they
long
to
see
and
hear
you
come
and
help
me
to
make
that
comparatively
small
though
thriving
people
grow
with
the
emigrants
from
the
countries
of
europe
and
america
till
it
covers
the
whole
territory
of
illinois
with
its
sturdy
sons
and
pious
daughters
i
will
ask
the
pope
to
make
you
my
coadjutor
and
you
will
soon
become
my
successor
for
i
already
feel
too
weak
and
unhealthy
to
bear
alone
the
burden
of
my
too
large
diocese
please
consider
what
i
propose
to
you
before
god
and
answer
me
but
be
kind
enough
to
consider
this
overture
as
strictly
confidential
between
you
and
me
till
we
have
brought
our
plans
into
execution
truly
yours
vandeveld
of
i
answered
him
that
the
bishops
of
boston
buffalo
and
detroit
had
already
advised
me
to
put
myself
at
the
head
of
the
french
canadian
emigration
in
order
to
direct
its
tide
towards
the
vast
and
rich
regions
of
the
west
i
wrote
him
that
i
felt
as
he
did
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
prevent
my
countrymen
from
falling
into
the
snares
laid
before
them
by
protestants
among
whom
they
were
scattering
themselves
i
told
him
that
i
would
consider
it
a
great
honor
and
privilege
to
spend
the
last
part
of
my
life
in
extending
the
power
and
influence
of
our
holy
church
over
the
united
states
and
that
i
would
in
june
next
pay
my
respects
to
him
in
chicago
when
on
my
way
towards
the
colony
of
my
countrymen
at
bourbonnais
grove
i
added
that
after
i
should
have
seen
those
territories
of
illinois
and
the
mississippi
valley
with
my
own
eyes
it
would
be
more
easy
to
give
him
a
definite
answer
i
ended
my
letter
by
saying
but
i
respectfully
request
your
lordship
to
give
up
the
idea
of
selecting
me
for
your
coadjutor
or
successor
i
have
already
twice
refused
to
become
a
bishop
that
high
dignity
is
too
much
above
my
merits
and
capacities
to
be
ever
accepted
by
me
i
am
happy
and
proud
to
fight
the
battles
of
our
holy
church
but
let
my
superiors
allow
me
to
continue
to
remain
in
her
ranks
simply
as
a
soldier
to
defend
her
honor
and
extend
her
power
i
may
then
with
the
help
of
god
do
some
good
but
i
feel
and
know
that
i
would
spoil
everything
if
raised
to
an
elevated
position
for
which
i
am
not
without
speaking
to
anybody
of
the
proposition
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
i
was
preparing
to
go
and
see
the
new
field
where
he
wanted
me
to
work
when
in
the
beginning
of
may
i
received
a
very
pressing
invitation
from
my
lord
lefebre
bishop
of
detroit
to
lecture
on
temperance
to
the
french
canadians
who
were
then
forming
the
majority
of
the
roman
catholics
of
that
city
that
bishop
had
taken
the
place
of
bishop
rese
whose
public
scandals
and
infamies
had
covered
the
whole
catholic
church
of
america
with
shame
during
the
last
years
he
had
spent
in
his
diocese
very
few
weeks
had
been
passed
without
his
being
picked
up
beastly
drunk
in
the
lowest
taverns
and
even
in
the
streets
of
detroit
and
dragged
unconscious
to
his
palace
after
long
and
vain
efforts
to
reform
him
the
pope
and
the
bishops
of
america
had
happily
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
go
to
rome
and
pay
his
respects
to
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
this
was
a
snare
too
skilfully
laid
to
be
suspected
by
the
drunken
bishop
he
had
hardly
set
his
feet
in
rome
when
the
inquisitors
threw
him
into
one
of
their
dungeons
where
he
remained
till
the
republicans
set
him
at
liberty
in
after
pope
pius
ix
had
fled
to
civita
vecchia
in
order
to
blot
out
from
the
face
of
his
church
the
black
spots
with
which
his
predecessor
had
covered
it
my
lord
lefebre
made
the
greatest
display
of
zeal
for
the
cause
of
temperance
as
soon
as
he
was
inducted
he
invited
his
people
to
follow
his
example
and
enroll
themselves
under
its
banners
in
a
very
powerful
address
on
the
evils
caused
by
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
at
the
end
of
his
eloquent
sermon
laying
his
right
hand
on
the
altar
he
made
a
solemn
promise
never
to
drink
any
alcoholic
liquors
his
telling
sermon
on
temperance
with
his
solemn
and
public
promise
were
published
through
nearly
all
the
papers
of
that
time
and
i
read
it
many
times
to
the
people
with
good
effect
when
on
my
way
to
illinois
i
reached
the
city
of
detroit
to
give
the
course
of
lectures
demanded
by
the
bishop
in
the
first
week
in
june
though
the
bishop
was
absent
i
immediately
began
to
preach
to
an
immense
audience
in
the
cathedral
i
had
agreed
to
give
five
lectures
and
it
was
only
during
the
third
one
that
bishop
lefebre
arrived
after
paying
me
great
compliments
for
my
zeal
and
success
in
the
temperance
cause
he
took
me
by
the
hand
to
his
and
said
let
us
go
and
refresh
i
shall
never
forget
my
surprise
and
dismay
when
i
perceived
the
long
dining
table
covered
with
bottles
of
brandy
wine
beer
prepared
for
himself
and
his
six
or
seven
priests
who
were
already
around
it
joyfully
emptying
their
glasses
my
first
thought
was
to
express
my
surprise
and
indignation
and
leave
the
room
in
disgust
but
by
a
second
and
better
thought
i
waited
a
little
to
see
more
of
that
unexpected
spectacle
i
accepted
the
seat
offered
me
by
the
bishop
at
his
right
hand
father
chiniquy
he
said
this
is
the
sweetest
claret
you
ever
and
before
i
could
utter
a
word
he
had
filled
my
large
glass
with
the
wine
and
drank
his
own
to
my
health
looking
at
the
bishop
in
amazement
i
said
what
does
this
mean
my
lord
it
means
that
i
want
to
drink
with
you
the
best
claret
you
ever
do
you
take
me
for
a
comedian
and
have
you
called
me
here
to
play
such
a
strange
comedy
i
replied
with
lips
trembling
with
indignation
i
did
not
invite
you
to
play
a
comedy
he
answered
i
invited
you
to
lecture
on
temperance
to
my
people
and
you
have
done
it
in
a
most
admirable
way
these
last
three
days
though
you
did
not
see
me
i
was
present
at
this
evening
s
address
i
never
heard
anything
so
eloquent
on
that
subject
as
what
you
said
but
now
that
you
have
fulfilled
your
duty
i
must
do
mine
which
is
to
treat
you
as
a
gentleman
and
drink
that
bottle
of
wine
with
but
my
lord
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
i
would
not
deserve
to
be
called
or
treated
as
a
gentleman
were
i
vile
enough
to
drink
wine
after
the
address
i
gave
this
i
beg
your
pardon
for
differing
from
you
answered
the
those
drunken
people
to
whom
you
spoke
so
well
against
the
evils
of
intemperance
are
in
need
of
the
stringent
and
bitter
remedies
you
offer
them
in
your
teetotalism
but
here
we
are
sober
men
and
gentlemen
we
do
not
want
such
remedies
i
never
thought
that
the
physicians
were
absolutely
bound
to
take
the
pills
they
administer
to
their
i
hope
your
lordship
will
not
deny
me
the
right
you
claim
for
yourself
to
differ
with
me
in
this
matter
i
entirely
differ
from
you
when
you
say
that
men
who
drink
as
you
do
with
your
priests
have
a
right
to
be
called
sober
i
fear
chiniquy
that
you
forget
where
you
are
and
to
whom
you
speak
just
now
replied
the
bishop
it
may
be
that
i
have
made
a
blunder
and
that
i
am
guilty
of
some
grave
error
in
coming
here
and
speaking
to
you
as
i
am
doing
my
lord
in
that
case
i
am
ready
to
ask
your
pardon
but
before
i
retract
what
i
have
said
please
allow
me
to
respectfully
ask
you
a
very
simple
then
taking
from
my
his
printed
address
and
his
public
and
solemn
promise
never
to
drink
neither
to
offer
any
intoxicating
drinks
to
others
i
read
it
aloud
and
said
are
you
the
same
bishop
of
detroit
called
lefebre
who
has
made
this
solemn
promise
if
you
are
not
the
same
man
i
will
retract
and
beg
your
pardon
but
if
you
are
the
same
i
have
nothing
to
my
answer
fell
upon
the
poor
bishop
as
a
thunderbolt
he
lisped
some
unintelligible
and
insignificant
explanation
which
however
he
ended
by
a
d
in
saying
my
dear
chiniquy
i
did
not
invite
you
to
preach
to
the
bishop
but
only
to
the
people
of
you
are
right
my
lord
i
was
not
called
to
preach
to
the
bishop
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
if
i
had
known
sooner
that
when
the
bishop
of
detroit
with
his
priests
solemnly
publicly
and
with
their
right
hand
on
the
altar
promised
that
they
would
never
drink
any
intoxicating
drinks
it
means
that
they
will
drink
and
fill
themselves
with
those
detestable
liquors
till
their
brains
shiver
with
their
poisonous
fumes
i
would
not
have
troubled
you
with
my
presence
or
my
remarks
here
however
allow
me
to
tell
your
lordship
to
be
kind
enough
to
find
another
lecturer
for
your
temperance
meetings
for
i
am
determined
to
take
the
train
morning
for
there
is
no
need
to
say
that
during
that
painful
conversation
the
priests
with
only
one
exception
were
as
full
of
indignation
against
me
as
they
were
full
of
wine
i
left
the
table
and
went
to
my
sleeping
apartment
overwhelmed
with
sadness
and
shame
half
an
hour
later
the
bishop
was
with
me
conjuring
me
to
continue
my
lectures
on
account
of
the
fearful
scandals
which
would
result
from
my
sudden
and
unexpected
exit
from
detroit
when
the
whole
people
had
the
assurance
from
me
that
very
night
that
i
would
continue
to
lecture
the
two
following
evenings
i
acknowledged
that
there
would
be
a
great
scandal
but
i
told
him
that
he
was
the
only
one
responsible
for
it
by
his
want
of
faith
and
consistency
he
at
first
tried
to
persuade
me
that
he
was
ordered
to
drink
by
his
own
physicians
for
his
health
but
i
showed
him
that
this
was
a
miserable
illusion
he
then
said
that
he
regretted
what
had
occurred
and
confessed
that
it
would
be
better
if
the
priests
practiced
what
they
preached
to
the
people
after
which
he
asked
me
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
to
forget
the
errors
of
the
bishop
and
priests
of
detroit
in
order
to
think
only
of
the
good
which
the
conversion
of
the
numberless
drunkards
of
that
city
would
do
to
the
people
he
spoke
to
me
with
such
earnestness
of
the
souls
saved
the
tears
dried
the
happiness
restored
to
hundreds
of
families
by
temperance
that
he
touched
the
most
sensitive
chords
of
my
heart
and
got
from
me
the
promise
that
i
would
deliver
the
other
two
expected
lectures
he
was
so
glad
that
he
pressed
me
on
his
bosom
and
gave
me
what
we
call
in
french
baiser
de
kiss
of
peace
to
show
me
his
esteem
and
gratitude
when
alone
i
tried
to
drown
in
a
sound
sleep
the
sad
emotions
of
that
evening
but
it
was
impossible
that
night
was
to
be
again
a
sleepless
one
to
me
the
intemperance
of
that
high
dignitary
and
his
priests
filled
me
with
an
unspeakable
horror
and
disgust
many
times
during
the
dark
hours
of
that
night
i
heard
as
if
it
were
a
voice
saying
to
me
do
you
not
see
that
the
bishops
and
priests
of
your
church
do
not
believe
a
word
of
their
religion
their
only
object
is
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
and
live
a
jolly
life
do
you
not
see
that
you
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
only
the
vain
and
lying
traditions
of
men
in
the
church
of
rome
come
out
of
it
break
the
heavy
yoke
which
is
upon
you
and
follow
the
simple
pure
religion
of
jesus
i
tried
to
silence
that
voice
by
saying
to
myself
these
sins
are
not
the
sins
of
my
holy
are
the
sins
of
individuals
it
was
not
the
fault
of
christ
if
judas
was
a
thief
it
is
not
more
the
fault
of
my
holy
church
if
this
bishop
and
his
priests
are
drunkards
and
worldly
men
where
will
i
go
if
i
leave
my
church
will
i
not
find
drunkards
and
infidels
everywhere
i
may
go
in
search
of
a
better
religion
the
dawn
of
the
next
day
found
me
feverish
and
unable
to
get
any
rest
in
my
bed
hoping
that
the
first
fresh
air
of
the
morning
would
do
me
good
i
went
to
the
beautiful
garden
covered
with
fruit
trees
of
all
kinds
which
was
then
around
the
episcopal
residence
but
what
was
my
surprise
to
see
the
bishop
leaning
on
a
tree
with
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
and
bathed
in
tears
i
approached
him
with
the
least
noise
possible
i
saw
that
he
did
not
perceive
me
by
the
motion
of
his
head
and
shoulders
it
became
evident
to
me
that
he
was
in
anguish
of
soul
i
said
to
him
my
dear
bishop
what
is
the
matter
why
do
you
weep
and
cry
at
such
an
early
hour
pressing
my
hand
convulsively
in
his
he
answered
dear
father
chiniquy
you
do
not
yet
know
the
awful
calamity
which
has
befallen
me
this
what
calamity
i
asked
do
you
not
remember
he
answered
that
young
priest
who
was
sitting
at
your
right
hand
last
evening
well
he
went
away
during
the
night
with
the
wife
of
a
young
man
whom
he
had
seduced
and
stole
from
me
before
he
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
at
that
when
i
remember
how
that
priest
emptied
his
glasses
of
beer
and
wine
last
night
i
answered
when
the
blood
of
a
man
is
heated
by
those
fiery
liquors
it
is
sheer
absurdity
to
think
that
he
will
keep
his
vow
of
you
are
right
you
are
right
god
almighty
has
punished
me
for
breaking
the
public
pledge
i
had
taken
never
to
drink
any
intoxicating
drinks
we
want
a
reform
in
our
midst
and
we
will
have
it
he
answered
but
what
horrible
scandal
one
of
my
young
priests
gone
with
that
young
wife
after
stealing
from
me
great
god
must
we
not
hide
our
face
now
in
this
city
i
could
say
nothing
to
alleviate
the
sorrow
of
the
poor
bishop
but
to
mingle
my
tears
of
shame
and
sorrow
with
his
i
went
back
to
my
room
where
i
wept
a
part
of
the
day
to
my
heart
s
content
on
the
unspeakable
degradation
of
that
priesthood
of
which
i
had
been
so
proud
and
about
which
i
had
such
exalted
views
when
i
entered
its
ranks
before
i
had
an
inside
view
of
its
dark
mysteries
of
course
the
next
two
days
that
i
was
the
guest
of
bishop
lefebre
not
a
single
drop
of
intoxicating
drink
was
seen
on
the
table
but
i
know
that
not
long
after
that
representative
of
the
pope
forgot
again
his
solemn
vows
and
continued
with
his
priests
drinking
till
he
died
a
most
miserable
death
in
chapter
xlviii
my
visit
to
chicago
in
predecessor
prairies
of
the
to
feelings
of
bishop
decline
sending
a
rich
woman
to
the
nunnery
to
enrich
the
plot
to
destroy
me
the
journey
from
detroit
to
chicago
in
the
month
of
june
was
not
so
pleasant
as
it
is
the
michigan
central
railroad
was
completed
then
only
to
new
buffalo
we
took
the
steamer
there
and
crossed
lake
michigan
to
chicago
where
we
arrived
the
next
morning
after
nearly
perishing
in
a
terrible
storm
on
the
of
june
i
first
landed
with
the
greatest
difficulty
on
a
badly
wrecked
wharf
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
some
of
the
streets
i
had
to
cross
in
order
to
reach
the
bishop
s
palace
were
almost
impassable
in
many
places
loose
planks
had
been
thrown
across
them
to
prevent
people
from
miring
in
the
mud
and
quicksands
the
first
sight
of
chicago
was
then
far
from
giving
an
idea
of
what
that
city
has
become
in
though
it
had
rapidly
increased
in
the
last
ten
years
its
population
was
then
not
much
more
than
the
only
line
of
railroad
finished
was
from
chicago
to
aurora
about
forty
miles
the
whole
population
of
the
state
of
illinois
was
then
not
much
beyond
chicago
alone
numbers
more
than
souls
within
her
limits
probably
more
grain
lumber
beef
and
pork
are
now
bought
and
sold
in
a
single
day
in
chicago
than
were
then
in
a
whole
year
when
i
entered
the
miserable
house
called
the
bishop
s
palace
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
the
planks
of
the
lower
floor
in
the
were
floating
and
it
required
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
to
keep
my
feet
dry
while
dining
with
him
for
the
first
time
but
the
christian
kindness
and
courtesy
of
the
bishop
made
me
more
happy
in
his
poor
house
than
i
felt
later
in
the
white
marble
palace
built
by
his
haughty
successor
o
regan
there
were
then
in
chicago
about
french
canadian
families
under
the
pastorate
of
the
rev
lebel
who
like
myself
was
born
in
kamouraska
the
drunkenness
and
other
immoralities
of
the
clergy
pictured
to
me
by
that
priest
surpassed
all
i
had
ever
heard
or
known
after
getting
my
promise
that
i
would
never
reveal
the
fact
before
his
death
he
assured
me
that
the
last
bishop
had
been
poisoned
by
one
of
his
grand
vicars
in
the
following
way
he
said
the
grand
vicar
being
father
confessor
of
the
nuns
of
loretto
had
fallen
in
love
with
one
of
the
virgins
who
died
a
few
days
after
becoming
the
mother
of
a
child
this
fact
having
transpired
and
threatening
to
give
a
great
deal
of
scandal
the
bishop
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
make
an
inquiry
and
punish
his
priest
if
he
should
be
found
guilty
but
the
grand
vicar
seeing
that
his
crime
was
to
be
easily
detected
found
that
the
shortest
way
to
escape
exposure
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
inquest
by
murdering
the
poor
bishop
a
poison
very
difficult
to
detect
was
administered
and
the
death
of
the
prelate
soon
followed
without
exciting
any
surprise
in
the
community
horrified
by
the
long
and
minute
details
of
that
mystery
of
iniquity
i
came
very
near
returning
to
canada
immediately
without
going
any
further
but
after
more
mature
consideration
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
awful
iniquities
on
the
part
of
the
priests
of
illinois
was
just
the
reason
why
i
should
not
shut
my
ears
to
the
voice
of
god
if
it
were
his
will
that
i
should
come
to
take
care
of
the
precious
souls
he
would
trust
to
me
i
spent
a
week
in
chicago
lecturing
on
temperance
every
evening
and
listening
during
the
days
to
the
grand
plans
the
bishop
was
maturing
in
order
to
make
our
church
of
rome
the
mistress
and
ruler
of
the
magnificent
valley
of
the
mississippi
which
included
the
states
of
minnesota
iowa
missouri
kansas
mississippi
etc
he
clearly
demonstrated
to
me
that
once
mistress
of
the
incalculable
treasures
of
those
rich
lands
through
the
millions
of
her
obedient
children
our
church
would
easily
command
the
respect
and
the
submission
of
the
less
favored
states
of
the
east
my
zeal
for
my
church
was
so
sincere
that
i
would
have
given
with
pleasure
every
drop
of
my
blood
in
order
to
secure
to
her
such
a
future
of
power
and
greatness
i
felt
really
happy
and
thankful
to
god
that
he
should
have
chosen
me
to
help
the
pope
and
the
bishops
realize
such
a
noble
and
magnificent
project
leaving
chicago
it
took
me
nearly
three
days
to
cross
the
vast
prairies
which
were
then
a
perfect
wilderness
between
chicago
and
bourbonnais
where
i
spent
three
weeks
in
preaching
and
exploring
the
country
extending
from
the
kankakee
river
to
the
towards
the
mississippi
it
was
only
then
that
i
plainly
understood
the
greatness
of
the
plans
of
the
bishop
and
that
i
determined
to
sacrifice
the
exalted
position
god
had
given
me
in
canada
to
guide
the
steps
of
the
roman
catholic
emigrants
from
france
belgium
and
canada
towards
the
regions
of
the
west
in
order
to
extend
the
power
and
influence
of
my
church
all
over
the
united
states
on
my
return
to
chicago
in
the
second
week
of
july
all
was
arranged
with
the
bishop
for
my
coming
back
in
the
autumn
to
help
him
to
accomplish
his
gigantic
plans
however
it
was
understood
between
us
that
my
leaving
canada
for
the
united
states
would
be
kept
a
secret
till
the
last
hour
on
account
of
the
stern
opposition
i
expected
from
my
bishop
the
last
thing
to
be
done
on
my
return
to
canada
in
order
to
prepare
the
emigrants
to
go
to
illinois
rather
than
any
other
part
of
the
united
states
was
to
tell
them
through
the
press
the
unrivaled
advantages
which
god
had
prepared
for
them
in
the
west
i
did
so
by
a
letter
which
was
published
not
only
by
the
press
of
canada
but
also
in
many
papers
of
france
and
belgium
the
importance
of
that
letter
is
such
that
i
hope
my
reader
will
bear
with
me
in
reproducing
the
following
extracts
from
it
montreal
canada
east
august
it
is
impossible
to
give
our
friends
by
narration
an
idea
of
what
we
feel
when
we
cross
for
the
first
time
the
immense
prairies
of
illinois
it
is
a
spectacle
which
must
be
seen
to
be
well
understood
as
you
advance
in
the
midst
of
these
boundless
deserts
where
your
eyes
perceive
nothing
but
lands
of
inexhaustible
richness
remaining
in
the
most
desolating
solitude
you
feel
something
which
you
can
not
express
by
any
words
is
your
soul
filled
with
joy
or
your
heart
broken
with
sadness
you
can
not
say
you
lift
up
your
eyes
to
heaven
and
the
voice
of
your
soul
is
chanting
a
hymn
of
gratitude
tears
of
joy
are
trickling
down
your
cheeks
and
you
bless
god
whose
curse
seems
not
to
have
fallen
on
the
land
where
you
stand
cursed
is
the
earth
in
thy
work
thorns
and
thistles
shall
it
bring
forth
to
you
see
around
you
the
most
luxuriant
verdure
flowers
of
every
kind
and
magnificence
above
description
but
if
in
the
silence
of
meditation
you
look
with
new
attention
on
those
prairies
so
rich
so
magnificent
you
feel
an
inexpressible
sentiment
of
sadness
and
addressing
yourself
to
the
blessed
land
you
say
why
art
thou
so
solitary
why
is
the
wild
game
alone
here
to
glorify
my
god
and
if
you
continue
to
advance
through
those
immense
prairies
which
like
a
boundless
ocean
are
spreading
their
rolling
waves
before
you
and
seem
to
long
after
the
presence
of
man
to
cover
themselves
with
incalculable
treasures
you
remember
your
friends
in
canada
and
more
particularly
those
among
them
who
crushed
down
by
misery
are
watering
with
the
sweat
of
their
brow
a
sterile
and
desolated
soil
you
say
ah
if
such
and
such
of
my
friends
were
here
how
soon
they
would
see
their
hard
and
ungrateful
labors
changed
into
the
most
smiling
and
happy
perhaps
i
will
be
accused
here
of
trying
to
depopulate
my
country
and
drive
my
countrymen
from
canada
to
the
united
states
no
no
i
never
had
so
perverse
a
design
here
is
my
mind
about
the
subject
of
emigration
and
i
see
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
or
to
conceal
it
it
is
a
fact
that
a
great
number
and
much
greater
than
generally
believed
of
french
canadians
are
yearly
emigrating
from
canada
and
nobody
regrets
it
more
than
i
do
but
as
long
as
those
who
govern
canada
will
not
pay
more
attention
to
that
evil
it
will
be
an
incurable
one
and
every
year
canada
will
lose
thousands
and
thousands
of
its
strongest
arms
and
noblest
hearts
to
benefit
our
happy
neighbors
with
many
others
i
had
the
hope
that
the
eloquent
voice
of
the
poor
settlers
of
our
eastern
townships
would
be
heard
and
that
the
government
would
help
them
but
that
hope
has
gone
like
a
dream
and
we
have
now
every
reason
to
fear
that
our
unfortunate
settlers
of
the
east
will
be
left
to
themselves
the
greatest
part
of
them
for
the
want
of
roads
to
the
markets
of
quebec
and
montreal
and
still
more
by
the
tyranny
of
their
cruel
landlords
will
soon
be
obliged
to
bid
an
eternal
adieu
to
their
country
and
with
an
enraged
heart
against
their
haughty
oppressors
they
will
seek
in
the
exile
to
a
strange
land
the
protection
they
could
not
find
in
their
own
country
yes
if
our
canadian
government
continues
a
little
longer
to
show
the
same
incomprehensible
and
stupid
apathy
for
the
welfare
of
its
own
subjects
emigration
will
increase
every
year
from
canada
to
swell
the
ranks
of
the
american
people
since
we
can
not
stop
that
emigration
is
it
not
our
first
duty
to
direct
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
to
the
poor
emigrants
as
little
injury
as
possible
let
us
do
everything
to
hinder
them
from
going
to
the
large
cities
of
the
united
states
drowned
in
the
mixed
population
of
american
cities
our
unfortunate
emigrating
countrymen
would
be
too
much
exposed
to
losing
their
morality
and
their
faith
surely
there
is
not
another
country
under
the
heavens
where
space
bread
and
liberty
are
so
universally
assured
to
every
member
of
the
community
as
the
united
states
but
it
is
not
in
the
great
cities
of
the
united
states
that
our
poor
countrymen
will
soonest
find
these
three
gifts
the
french
canadian
who
will
stop
in
the
large
cities
will
not
with
a
very
few
exceptions
raise
himself
above
the
unenviable
position
of
a
poor
journeyman
but
those
among
them
who
will
direct
their
steps
towards
the
rich
and
extensive
prairies
of
bourbonnais
will
certainly
find
a
better
lot
many
in
canada
would
believe
that
i
am
exaggerating
were
i
to
publish
how
happy
prosperous
and
respectable
is
the
french
canadian
population
of
bourbonnais
the
french
canadians
of
bourbonnais
have
had
the
intelligence
to
follow
the
good
example
of
the
industrious
american
farmers
in
the
manner
of
cultivating
the
lands
on
their
farms
as
well
as
those
of
their
neighbors
you
will
find
the
best
machinery
to
cut
their
crops
to
thresh
their
grain
they
enjoy
the
just
reputation
of
having
the
best
horses
in
the
country
and
very
few
can
beat
them
for
the
number
and
quality
of
their
cattle
now
what
can
be
the
prospects
of
a
young
man
in
canada
if
he
has
not
more
than
a
whole
life
of
hard
labor
and
continued
privation
is
his
too
certain
lot
but
let
that
young
man
go
directly
to
bourbonnais
and
if
he
is
industrious
sober
and
religious
before
a
couple
of
years
he
will
see
nothing
to
envy
in
the
most
happy
farmer
in
canada
as
the
land
he
will
take
in
illinois
is
entirely
prepared
for
the
plow
he
has
no
trees
to
cut
or
eradicate
no
stones
to
move
no
ditch
to
dig
his
only
work
is
to
fence
and
break
his
land
and
sow
it
and
the
very
first
year
the
value
of
the
crop
will
be
sufficient
to
pay
for
his
farm
holy
providence
has
prepared
everything
for
the
benefit
of
the
happy
farmers
of
illinois
that
fertile
country
is
well
watered
by
a
multitude
of
rivers
and
large
creeks
whose
borders
are
generally
covered
with
the
most
rich
and
extensive
groves
of
timber
of
the
best
quality
as
black
oak
maple
white
oak
burr
oak
etc
the
seeds
of
the
beautiful
acacia
locust
after
five
or
six
years
will
give
you
a
splendid
tree
the
greatest
variety
of
fruits
are
growing
naturally
in
almost
every
part
of
illinois
coal
mines
have
been
discovered
in
the
very
heart
of
the
country
more
than
sufficient
for
the
wants
of
the
people
before
long
a
railroad
from
chicago
to
bourbonnais
will
bring
our
happy
countrymen
to
the
most
extensive
market
the
queen
city
of
the
i
will
then
say
to
my
young
countrymen
who
intend
emigrating
from
canada
my
friend
exile
is
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
that
can
befall
a
man
young
canadian
remain
in
thy
country
keep
thy
heart
to
love
it
thy
intelligence
to
adorn
it
and
thine
arms
to
protect
it
young
and
dear
countrymen
remain
in
thy
beautiful
country
there
is
nothing
more
grand
and
sublime
in
the
world
than
the
waters
of
the
lawrence
it
is
on
those
deep
and
majestic
waters
that
before
long
europe
and
america
will
meet
and
bind
themselves
to
each
other
by
the
blessed
bonds
of
an
eternal
peace
it
is
on
its
shores
that
they
will
exchange
their
incalculable
treasures
remain
in
the
country
of
thy
birth
my
dear
son
let
the
sweat
of
thy
brow
continue
to
fertilize
it
and
let
the
perfume
of
thy
virtues
bring
the
blessing
of
god
upon
it
but
my
dear
son
if
thou
hast
no
more
room
in
the
valley
of
the
lawrence
and
if
by
the
want
of
protection
from
the
government
thou
canst
not
go
to
the
forest
without
running
the
danger
of
losing
thy
life
in
a
pond
or
being
crushed
under
the
feet
of
an
english
or
scotch
tyrant
i
am
not
the
man
to
invite
thee
to
exhaust
thy
best
days
for
the
benefit
of
the
insolent
strangers
who
are
the
lords
of
the
eastern
lands
i
will
sooner
tell
thee
go
my
child
there
are
many
extensive
places
still
vacant
on
the
earth
and
god
is
everywhere
that
great
god
calleth
thee
to
another
land
submit
thyself
to
his
divine
will
but
before
you
bid
a
final
adieu
to
thy
country
engrave
on
thy
heart
and
keep
as
a
holy
deposit
the
love
of
thy
holy
religion
of
thy
beautiful
language
and
of
the
dear
and
unfortunate
country
of
thy
birth
on
thy
way
to
the
land
of
exile
stop
as
little
as
possible
in
the
great
cities
for
fear
of
the
many
snares
thy
eternal
enemy
has
prepared
for
thy
perdition
but
go
straight
to
bourbonnais
there
you
will
find
many
of
thy
brothers
who
have
erected
the
cross
of
christ
join
thyself
to
them
thou
shalt
be
strong
of
their
strength
go
and
help
them
to
conquer
to
the
gospel
of
jesus
those
rich
countries
which
shall
very
soon
weigh
more
than
is
generally
believed
in
the
balance
of
the
nations
yes
go
straight
to
illinois
thou
shalt
be
not
entirely
in
a
strange
and
alien
country
holy
providence
has
chosen
thy
fathers
to
find
that
rich
country
and
to
reveal
to
the
world
its
admirable
resources
more
than
once
that
land
of
illinois
has
been
sanctified
by
the
blood
of
thy
ancestors
in
illinois
thou
shalt
not
make
a
step
without
finding
indestructible
proof
of
the
perseverance
genius
bravery
and
piety
of
thy
french
forefathers
go
to
illinois
and
the
many
names
of
bourbonnais
joliet
dubuque
la
salle
charles
mary
that
you
will
meet
everywhere
will
tell
you
more
than
my
words
that
that
country
is
nothing
but
the
rich
inheritance
which
your
fathers
have
found
for
the
benefit
of
their
chiniquy
i
would
never
have
published
this
letter
if
i
had
foreseen
its
effects
on
the
farmers
of
canada
in
a
few
days
after
its
appearance
their
farms
fell
to
half
their
value
every
one
in
some
parishes
wanted
to
sell
their
lands
and
emigrate
to
the
west
it
was
only
for
want
of
purchasers
that
we
did
not
see
an
emigration
which
would
have
surely
ruined
canada
i
was
frightened
by
its
immediate
effect
on
the
public
mind
however
while
some
were
praising
me
to
the
skies
for
having
published
it
others
were
cursing
me
and
calling
me
a
traitor
the
very
day
after
its
publication
i
was
in
quebec
where
the
bishops
of
canada
were
met
in
council
the
first
one
i
met
was
my
lord
de
charbonel
bishop
of
toronto
after
having
blessed
me
he
pressed
my
hand
and
said
i
have
just
read
your
admirable
letter
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
eloquently
written
articles
i
ever
read
the
spirit
of
god
has
surely
inspired
every
one
of
its
sentences
i
have
just
now
forwarded
six
copies
of
it
to
different
journals
of
france
and
belgium
where
they
will
be
republished
and
do
an
incalculable
amount
of
good
by
directing
the
catholic
emigrants
towards
a
country
where
they
will
run
no
risk
of
losing
their
faith
with
the
assurance
of
securing
a
future
of
unbounded
prosperity
for
their
families
your
name
will
be
put
among
the
names
of
the
greatest
benefactors
of
though
these
compliments
seemed
to
me
much
exaggerated
and
unmerited
i
can
not
deny
that
they
pleased
me
by
adding
to
my
hopes
and
convictions
that
great
good
would
surely
come
from
the
plan
i
had
of
gathering
all
the
roman
catholic
emigrants
on
the
same
spot
to
form
such
large
and
strong
congregations
that
they
would
have
nothing
to
fear
from
heretics
i
thanked
the
bishop
for
his
kind
and
friendly
words
and
left
him
to
go
and
present
my
respectful
salutations
to
my
bishop
of
montreal
my
lord
bourget
and
give
him
a
short
sketch
of
my
voyage
to
the
far
west
i
found
him
alone
in
his
room
in
the
very
act
of
reading
my
letter
a
lioness
who
had
just
lost
her
whelps
would
not
have
looked
upon
me
with
more
angry
and
threatening
eyes
than
that
bishop
did
is
it
possible
he
said
mr
chiniquy
that
your
hand
has
written
and
signed
such
a
perfidious
document
how
could
you
so
cruelly
pierce
the
bosom
of
your
own
country
after
her
dealing
so
nobly
with
you
do
you
not
see
that
your
treasonable
letter
will
give
such
an
impetus
to
emigration
that
our
most
thriving
parishes
will
soon
be
turned
into
solitude
though
you
do
not
say
it
we
feel
at
every
line
of
that
letter
that
you
also
will
leave
your
country
to
give
help
and
comfort
to
our
natural
surprised
by
this
unexpected
burst
of
bad
feelings
i
kept
my
and
answered
my
lord
your
lordship
has
surely
misunderstood
me
if
you
have
found
in
my
letter
any
treasonable
plan
to
ruin
our
country
please
read
it
again
and
you
will
see
that
every
line
has
been
inspired
by
the
purest
motives
of
patriotism
and
the
highest
views
of
religion
how
is
it
possible
that
the
worthy
bishop
of
toronto
should
have
told
me
that
the
spirit
of
god
himself
had
dictated
every
line
of
that
letter
when
my
good
bishop
s
opinion
is
so
completely
opposite
the
abrupt
answer
the
bishop
gave
to
these
remarks
clearly
indicated
that
my
absence
would
be
more
welcome
than
my
presence
i
left
him
after
asking
his
blessing
which
he
gave
me
in
the
coldest
manner
possible
on
the
of
august
i
was
back
at
longueuil
from
my
voyage
to
quebec
which
i
had
extended
as
far
as
kamouraska
to
see
again
the
parishioners
whose
unanimity
in
taking
the
pledge
of
temperance
and
admirable
fidelity
in
keeping
it
then
had
filled
my
heart
with
such
joy
i
related
my
last
interview
with
bishop
bourget
to
my
faithful
friend
brassard
he
answered
me
the
present
bad
feelings
of
the
bishop
of
montreal
against
you
are
no
secret
to
me
unfortunately
the
men
who
surround
and
council
him
are
as
unable
as
the
bishop
himself
to
understand
your
exalted
views
in
directing
the
steps
of
the
roman
catholics
towards
the
splendid
valley
of
the
mississippi
they
are
beside
themselves
because
they
see
that
you
will
easily
succeed
in
forming
a
grand
colony
of
people
in
illinois
now
i
am
sure
of
what
i
say
though
i
am
not
free
to
tell
you
how
it
came
to
my
knowledge
there
is
a
plot
somewhere
to
dishonor
and
destroy
you
at
once
those
who
are
at
the
head
of
that
plot
hope
that
if
they
can
succeed
in
destroying
your
popularity
nobody
will
be
tempted
to
follow
you
to
illinois
for
though
you
have
concealed
it
as
well
as
you
could
it
is
evident
to
every
one
now
that
you
are
the
man
selected
by
the
bishops
of
the
west
to
direct
the
uncertain
steps
of
the
poor
emigrants
towards
those
rich
do
you
mean
my
dear
brassard
i
replied
that
there
are
priests
around
the
bishop
of
montreal
cruel
and
vile
enough
to
forge
calumnies
against
me
and
spread
them
before
the
country
in
such
a
way
that
i
shall
be
unable
to
refute
it
is
just
what
i
mean
answered
brassard
mind
what
i
tell
you
the
bishop
has
made
use
of
you
to
reform
his
diocese
he
likes
you
for
that
work
but
your
popularity
is
too
great
for
your
enemies
they
want
to
get
rid
of
you
and
no
means
will
be
too
vile
or
criminal
to
accomplish
your
destruction
if
they
can
attain
their
but
my
dear
brassard
can
you
give
me
any
details
of
the
plots
which
are
in
store
against
me
i
asked
no
i
can
not
for
i
know
them
not
but
be
on
your
guard
for
your
few
but
powerful
enemies
are
jubilant
they
speak
of
the
absolute
impotency
to
which
you
will
soon
be
reduced
if
you
accomplish
what
they
so
maliciously
and
falsely
call
your
treacherous
i
answered
our
saviour
has
said
to
all
his
disciples
in
the
world
ye
shall
have
tribulations
but
be
of
good
cheer
i
have
overcome
the
i
am
more
determined
than
ever
to
put
my
trust
in
god
and
fear
no
two
hours
after
this
conversation
i
received
the
following
from
the
rev
pare
secretary
to
the
bishop
to
the
rev
chiniquy
apostle
of
temperance
my
dear
sir
lord
bishop
of
montreal
would
like
to
see
you
upon
some
important
business
please
come
at
your
earliest
convenience
yours
truly
jos
pare
secretary
the
next
morning
i
was
alone
with
monseigneur
bourget
who
received
me
very
kindly
he
seemed
at
first
to
have
entirely
banished
the
bad
feelings
he
had
shown
in
our
last
interview
at
quebec
after
making
some
friendly
remarks
on
my
continual
labors
and
success
in
the
cause
of
temperance
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
seemed
embarrassed
how
to
resume
the
conversation
at
last
he
said
are
you
not
the
father
confessor
of
chenier
yes
my
lord
i
have
been
her
confessor
since
i
lived
in
very
well
very
well
he
rejoined
i
suppose
that
you
know
that
her
only
child
is
a
nun
in
the
congregation
yes
my
lord
i
know
it
i
replied
could
you
not
induce
mrs
chenier
to
become
a
nun
also
asked
the
bishop
i
never
thought
of
that
my
lord
i
answered
and
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
advise
her
to
exchange
her
beautiful
cottage
washed
by
the
fresh
and
pure
waters
of
the
lawrence
where
she
looks
so
happy
and
cheerful
for
the
gloomy
walls
of
the
but
she
is
still
young
and
beautiful
she
may
be
deceived
by
temptation
when
she
is
there
in
that
beautiful
house
surrounded
by
all
the
enjoyments
of
her
fortune
replied
the
bishop
i
understand
your
lordship
yes
mrs
chenier
has
the
reputation
of
being
rich
though
i
know
nothing
of
her
fortune
she
has
kept
well
the
charms
and
freshness
of
her
youth
however
i
think
that
the
best
remedy
against
the
temptations
you
seem
to
dread
so
much
for
her
is
to
advise
her
to
marry
a
good
christian
husband
seems
to
me
a
much
better
remedy
against
the
dangers
to
which
your
lordship
alludes
than
the
cheerless
walls
of
a
you
speak
just
as
a
protestant
rejoined
the
bishop
with
an
evident
nervous
irritation
we
remark
that
though
you
hear
the
confessions
of
a
great
number
of
young
ladies
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
them
who
has
ever
become
a
nun
you
seem
to
ignore
that
the
vow
of
chastity
is
the
shortest
way
to
a
life
of
holiness
in
this
world
and
happiness
in
the
i
am
sorry
to
differ
from
your
lordship
in
that
matter
i
replied
but
i
can
not
help
it
the
remedy
you
have
found
against
sin
is
quite
modern
the
old
remedy
offered
by
our
god
himself
is
very
different
and
much
better
i
think
it
is
not
good
that
man
shall
remain
alone
i
will
make
a
for
him
said
our
creator
in
the
earthly
paradise
and
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
wife
and
let
every
woman
have
her
husband
said
the
same
god
through
his
apostle
paul
i
know
too
well
how
the
great
majority
of
nuns
keep
their
vows
of
chastity
to
believe
that
the
modern
remedy
against
the
temptations
you
mention
is
an
improvement
on
the
old
one
found
and
given
by
our
god
i
answered
with
an
angry
look
the
bishop
replied
this
is
protestantism
chiniquy
this
is
sheer
i
respectfully
ask
your
pardon
for
differing
from
your
lordship
this
is
not
protestantism
it
is
simply
and
absolutely
the
pure
word
of
but
my
lord
god
knows
that
it
is
my
sincere
desire
as
it
is
my
interest
and
my
duty
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
deserve
your
esteem
i
do
not
want
to
vex
nor
disobey
you
please
give
me
a
good
reason
why
i
should
advise
chenier
to
enter
a
monastery
and
i
will
comply
with
your
request
the
very
first
time
she
comes
to
resuming
his
most
amiable
manner
the
bishop
answered
me
my
first
reason
is
the
spiritual
good
which
she
would
receive
from
her
vows
of
perpetual
chastity
and
poverty
in
nunnery
the
second
reason
is
that
the
lady
is
rich
and
we
are
in
need
of
money
we
would
soon
possess
her
whole
fortune
for
her
only
child
is
already
in
the
congregation
my
dear
bishop
i
replied
you
already
know
what
i
think
of
your
first
reason
after
having
investigated
that
fact
not
in
the
protestant
books
but
from
the
lips
of
the
nuns
themselves
as
well
as
from
their
father
confessors
i
am
fully
convinced
that
the
real
virtue
of
purity
is
much
better
kept
in
the
homes
of
our
christian
mothers
married
sisters
and
female
friends
than
in
the
secret
rooms
not
to
say
prisons
where
the
poor
nuns
are
enchained
by
the
heavy
fetters
assumed
by
their
vows
which
the
great
majority
curse
when
they
can
not
break
them
and
for
the
second
reason
your
lordship
gives
me
to
induce
chenier
becoming
a
nun
i
am
again
sorry
to
say
that
i
can
not
conscientiously
accept
it
i
have
not
consecrated
myself
to
the
priesthood
to
deprive
respectable
families
of
their
legal
inheritance
in
order
to
enrich
myself
or
anybody
else
i
know
she
has
poor
relations
who
need
her
fortune
after
her
do
you
pretend
to
say
that
your
bishop
is
a
thief
angrily
rejoined
the
bishop
no
my
lord
by
no
means
no
doubt
from
your
high
standpoint
of
view
your
lordship
may
see
things
in
a
very
different
aspect
from
what
i
see
them
in
the
low
position
i
occupy
in
the
church
but
as
your
lordship
is
bound
to
follow
the
dictates
of
your
conscience
in
everything
i
also
feel
obliged
to
give
heed
to
the
voice
of
this
painful
conversation
had
already
lasted
too
long
i
was
anxious
to
see
the
end
of
it
for
i
could
easily
read
in
the
face
of
my
superior
that
every
word
i
uttered
was
sealing
my
doom
i
rose
up
to
take
leave
of
him
and
said
my
lord
i
beg
your
pardon
for
disappointing
your
he
coldly
answered
me
it
is
not
the
first
time
though
i
would
it
were
the
last
that
you
show
such
a
want
of
respect
and
submission
to
the
will
of
your
superiors
but
as
i
feel
it
is
a
conscientious
affair
on
your
part
i
have
no
against
you
and
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
i
entertain
for
you
all
my
past
esteem
the
only
favor
i
ask
from
you
just
now
is
that
this
conversation
may
be
kept
i
answered
it
is
still
more
to
my
interest
than
yours
to
keep
this
unfortunate
affair
a
secret
between
us
i
hope
that
neither
your
lordship
nor
the
great
god
who
alone
has
heard
us
will
ever
make
it
an
imperious
duty
for
me
to
mention
what
good
news
do
you
bring
me
from
the
bishop
s
palace
asked
my
venerable
friend
brassard
when
i
returned
late
in
the
afternoon
i
would
have
very
spicy
though
unpalatable
news
to
give
you
had
not
the
bishop
asked
me
to
keep
what
has
been
said
between
us
a
brassard
laughed
outright
at
my
answer
and
replied
a
secret
a
secret
ah
but
it
is
a
gazette
secret
for
the
bishop
has
bothered
me
as
well
as
many
others
with
that
matter
frequently
since
your
return
from
illinois
several
times
he
has
asked
us
to
persuade
you
to
advise
your
devoted
penitent
chenier
to
become
a
nun
i
knew
he
invited
you
to
his
palace
yesterday
for
that
the
eyes
and
the
heart
of
our
poor
bishop
continued
brassard
are
too
firmly
fixed
on
the
fortune
of
that
lady
hence
his
zeal
about
the
salvation
of
her
soul
through
the
monastic
life
in
vain
i
tried
to
dissuade
the
bishop
from
speaking
to
you
on
that
subject
on
account
of
your
prejudices
against
our
good
nuns
he
would
not
listen
to
me
no
doubt
you
have
realized
my
worst
anticipations
you
have
with
your
usual
stubbornness
refused
to
yield
to
his
demands
i
fear
you
have
added
to
his
bad
feelings
and
consummated
your
what
a
deceitful
man
that
bishop
is
i
answered
indignantly
he
has
given
me
to
understand
that
this
was
a
most
sacred
secret
between
him
and
me
when
i
see
by
what
you
say
that
it
is
nothing
else
than
a
farcical
secret
known
by
the
hundreds
who
have
heard
of
it
but
please
my
dear
brassard
tell
me
is
it
not
a
burning
shame
that
our
nunneries
are
changed
into
real
traps
to
steal
cheat
and
ruin
so
many
unsuspecting
families
i
have
no
words
to
express
my
disgust
and
indignation
when
i
see
that
all
those
great
demonstrations
and
eloquent
tirades
about
the
perfection
and
holiness
of
the
nuns
on
the
part
of
our
spiritual
rulers
are
nothing
else
in
reality
than
a
veil
to
conceal
their
stealing
operations
do
you
not
feel
that
those
poor
nuns
are
the
victims
of
the
most
stupendous
system
of
swindling
the
world
has
ever
seen
i
know
that
there
are
some
honorable
exceptions
for
instance
the
nunnery
you
have
founded
here
is
an
exception
you
have
not
built
it
to
enrich
yourself
as
you
have
spent
your
last
cent
in
its
erection
but
you
and
i
are
only
simpletons
who
have
till
now
ignored
the
terrible
secrets
which
put
that
machine
of
the
nunneries
and
monkeries
in
motion
i
am
more
than
ever
disgusted
and
terrified
not
only
by
the
unspeakable
corruptions
but
also
by
the
stupendous
system
of
swindling
which
is
their
foundation
stone
if
the
cities
of
quebec
and
montreal
could
know
what
i
know
of
the
incalculable
sums
of
money
secretly
stolen
through
the
confessional
to
aid
our
bishops
in
building
the
famous
cathedrals
and
splendid
palaces
or
to
cover
themselves
with
robes
of
silk
satin
silver
and
gold
to
live
more
luxurious
than
the
pashas
of
turkey
they
would
set
fire
to
all
those
palatial
buildings
they
would
hang
the
confessors
who
have
thrown
the
poor
nuns
into
these
dungeons
under
the
pretext
of
saving
their
souls
when
the
real
motive
was
to
lay
hands
on
their
inheritance
and
raise
their
colossal
fortunes
the
bishop
has
opened
before
me
a
most
deplorable
and
shameful
page
of
the
history
of
our
church
it
makes
me
understand
many
facts
which
were
a
mystery
to
me
till
now
i
understand
the
terrible
wrath
of
the
english
people
in
the
days
of
old
and
of
the
french
people
more
recently
when
they
so
violently
wrenched
from
the
hands
of
the
clergy
the
enormous
wealth
they
had
accumulated
during
the
dark
ages
i
have
condemned
those
great
nations
till
now
but
i
absolve
them
i
am
sure
that
those
men
though
blind
and
cruel
in
their
vengeance
were
the
ministers
of
the
justice
of
god
the
god
of
heaven
could
not
forever
tolerate
a
sacrilegious
system
of
swindling
as
i
know
now
to
be
in
operation
from
one
end
to
the
other
not
only
of
canada
but
of
the
whole
world
under
the
mask
of
religion
i
know
that
the
bishop
and
his
flatterers
will
hate
and
persecute
me
for
my
stern
opposition
to
his
rapacity
but
i
do
feel
happy
and
proud
of
his
hatred
the
god
of
truth
and
justice
the
god
of
the
gospel
will
be
on
my
side
when
they
attack
me
i
do
not
fear
them
let
them
come
that
bishop
surely
did
not
know
me
when
he
thought
that
i
would
consent
to
be
the
instrument
of
his
hypocrisy
and
that
under
the
false
pretext
of
a
delusive
perfection
i
would
throw
that
lady
into
a
dungeon
for
her
life
that
he
might
become
rich
with
her
brassard
answered
me
i
can
not
blame
you
for
your
disobeying
the
bishop
in
this
instance
i
foretold
him
what
has
occurred
for
i
knew
what
you
think
of
the
nuns
though
i
do
not
go
as
far
as
you
in
that
i
can
not
absolutely
shut
my
eyes
to
the
facts
which
stare
us
in
the
face
those
monkish
communities
have
in
every
age
been
the
principal
cause
of
the
calamities
which
have
befallen
the
church
for
their
love
of
riches
their
pride
and
laziness
with
their
other
scandals
have
always
been
the
same
had
i
been
able
to
foresee
what
has
occurred
inside
the
walls
of
the
nunnery
i
built
up
here
i
never
would
have
erected
it
however
now
that
i
have
built
it
it
is
the
child
of
my
old
age
i
feel
bound
to
support
it
to
the
end
this
does
not
prevent
me
from
being
afflicted
when
i
see
the
facility
with
which
our
poor
nuns
yield
to
the
criminal
desires
of
their
too
weak
confessors
who
could
have
thought
for
instance
that
that
lean
and
ugly
superior
of
the
oblates
father
allard
could
have
fallen
in
love
with
his
young
nuns
and
that
so
many
would
have
lost
their
hearts
on
his
account
have
you
heard
how
the
young
men
of
our
village
indignant
at
his
spending
the
greater
part
of
the
night
with
the
nuns
have
whipped
him
when
he
was
crossing
the
bridge
not
long
before
his
leaving
longueuil
for
africa
it
is
evident
that
our
bishop
multiplies
too
fast
those
religious
houses
my
fear
is
that
they
will
sooner
than
we
expect
bring
upon
our
church
of
canada
the
same
cataclysms
which
have
so
often
desolated
her
in
england
france
germany
and
even
in
the
clock
struck
twelve
just
when
this
last
sentence
fell
from
the
lips
of
brassard
it
was
quite
time
to
take
some
rest
when
leaving
me
for
his
sleeping
room
he
said
my
dear
chiniquy
gird
your
loins
well
sharpen
your
sword
for
the
impending
conflict
my
fear
is
that
the
bishop
and
his
advisers
will
never
forget
your
wrenching
from
their
hands
the
booty
they
were
coveting
so
long
they
will
never
forgive
the
spirit
of
independence
with
which
you
have
rebuked
them
in
fact
the
conflict
is
already
begun
may
god
protect
you
against
the
open
blows
and
the
secret
machinations
they
have
in
store
for
i
answered
him
i
do
not
fear
them
i
put
my
trust
in
god
it
is
for
his
honor
i
am
fighting
and
suffering
he
will
surely
protect
me
from
those
sacrilegious
traders
in
chapter
xlix
the
plot
to
destroy
retreat
at
the
jesuits
lost
girl
employed
by
the
bishop
bishop
confounded
sees
his
injustice
makes
benediction
before
i
leave
canada
the
first
week
of
september
i
was
hearing
confessions
in
one
of
the
churches
of
montreal
when
a
girl
came
to
confess
sins
whose
depravity
surpassed
anything
i
had
ever
heard
though
i
forbade
her
twice
to
do
it
she
gave
me
the
names
of
several
priests
who
were
the
accomplices
of
her
orgies
the
details
of
her
iniquities
were
told
with
such
cynical
impudence
that
the
idea
struck
me
at
once
that
she
was
sent
by
some
one
to
ruin
me
i
abruptly
stopped
her
disgusting
stories
by
saying
the
way
you
confess
your
sins
is
a
sure
indication
that
you
do
not
come
here
to
reconcile
yourself
to
god
but
to
ruin
me
by
the
grace
of
god
you
will
fail
i
forbid
you
to
come
any
more
to
my
confessional
if
i
see
you
again
among
my
penitents
i
will
order
the
beadle
to
turn
you
out
of
the
i
instantly
shut
the
door
of
the
small
aperture
through
which
she
was
speaking
to
me
she
answered
something
which
i
could
not
understand
but
the
tone
of
her
voice
the
shaking
of
her
hands
and
head
with
her
manner
of
walking
when
she
left
the
confessional
indicated
that
she
was
beside
herself
with
rage
as
she
went
to
speak
a
few
words
to
a
carter
who
was
in
the
church
preparing
himself
to
confess
the
next
evening
i
said
to
rev
brassard
that
i
suspected
that
a
girl
was
sent
to
my
confessional
to
ruin
me
he
answered
did
i
not
warn
you
sometime
ago
that
there
was
a
plot
to
destroy
you
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
but
that
that
girl
was
hired
to
begin
that
diabolical
work
you
have
no
idea
of
my
anxiety
about
you
for
i
know
your
enemies
will
not
shrink
from
any
iniquity
to
destroy
your
good
name
and
prevent
you
from
directing
the
tide
of
emigration
from
canada
to
the
valley
of
the
i
replied
that
i
could
not
partake
of
his
fears
that
god
knew
my
innocence
and
the
purity
of
my
motives
he
would
defend
and
protect
my
dear
chiniquy
replied
brassard
i
know
your
enemies
they
are
not
numerous
but
they
are
implacable
and
their
power
for
mischief
knows
no
limits
surely
god
can
save
you
from
their
hands
but
i
can
not
share
your
security
for
the
future
your
answer
to
the
bishop
in
reference
to
chenier
when
you
refused
to
send
her
to
the
nunnery
that
he
might
inherit
her
fortune
has
forever
alienated
him
from
you
bishop
bourget
has
the
merited
reputation
of
being
the
most
revengeful
man
in
canada
he
will
avail
himself
of
the
least
opportunity
to
strike
you
without
i
answered
though
there
should
be
a
thousand
bishops
bourget
to
plot
against
me
i
will
not
fear
them
so
long
as
i
am
in
the
right
as
i
am
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
i
bade
him
good
night
and
ten
minutes
later
i
was
sound
asleep
the
following
days
i
went
to
deliver
a
course
of
lectures
on
temperance
to
several
parishes
south
of
laprairie
till
the
of
september
after
which
i
came
back
from
st
constant
to
rest
for
a
few
days
and
prepare
to
start
for
chicago
on
my
arrival
i
found
on
my
table
a
short
letter
from
bishop
bourget
telling
me
that
for
a
criminal
action
which
he
did
not
want
to
mention
committed
with
a
person
he
would
not
name
he
had
withdrawn
all
my
priestly
powers
and
interdicted
me
i
handed
the
letter
to
brassard
and
said
is
not
this
the
fulfillment
of
your
prophecies
what
do
you
think
of
a
bishop
who
interdicts
a
priest
without
giving
him
a
single
fact
and
without
even
allowing
him
to
know
his
accusers
it
is
just
what
i
expected
from
the
implacable
vengeance
of
the
bishop
of
montreal
he
will
never
give
you
the
reasons
of
your
interdict
for
he
knows
well
you
are
innocent
and
he
will
never
confront
you
with
your
accusers
for
it
would
be
too
easy
for
you
to
confound
but
is
not
this
against
all
the
laws
of
god
and
man
is
it
not
against
the
laws
of
the
church
i
replied
of
course
it
is
he
answered
but
do
you
not
know
that
on
this
continent
of
america
the
bishops
have
long
ago
thrown
overboard
all
the
laws
of
god
and
man
and
all
the
laws
of
the
church
to
rule
and
enslave
the
priests
i
replied
if
it
be
so
are
not
protestants
correct
when
they
say
that
our
church
has
rejected
the
word
of
god
to
follow
the
traditions
of
man
what
can
we
answer
them
when
they
tell
us
that
our
church
has
no
right
to
be
called
the
church
of
god
would
the
son
of
god
have
given
up
his
life
on
the
cross
to
save
men
that
they
might
be
the
property
of
a
few
lawless
tyrants
who
should
have
the
right
to
take
away
their
honor
and
life
i
am
not
ready
to
answer
those
puzzling
questions
he
answered
but
this
is
the
fact
though
it
is
absolutely
against
all
the
laws
of
the
church
to
condemn
a
priest
without
showing
him
his
guilt
and
confronting
him
with
his
accusers
our
modern
bishops
every
week
condemn
some
of
their
priests
without
specifying
any
fact
or
even
giving
them
the
names
of
their
mind
what
i
tell
you
i
replied
i
will
not
allow
the
bishop
to
deal
with
me
in
that
way
if
he
dares
to
trample
the
laws
of
the
gospel
under
his
feet
to
accomplish
my
ruin
and
satisfy
his
vengeance
i
will
teach
him
a
lesson
that
he
will
never
forget
thanks
be
to
god
it
is
not
the
gory
cross
of
the
bloody
inquisition
but
the
emblem
of
the
british
lion
which
i
see
there
floating
on
the
tower
to
protect
our
honor
and
life
in
canada
i
am
innocent
god
knows
it
my
trust
is
in
him
he
will
not
forsake
me
i
will
go
immediately
to
the
bishop
if
he
never
knew
what
power
there
is
in
an
honest
priest
he
will
learn
it
two
hours
later
i
was
knocking
at
the
bishop
s
door
he
received
me
with
icy
politeness
my
lord
i
said
you
already
know
why
i
am
in
your
presence
here
is
a
letter
from
you
accusing
me
of
a
crime
which
is
not
specified
under
the
testimony
of
accusers
whom
you
refuse
to
name
and
before
hearing
me
and
confronting
me
with
my
accusers
you
punish
me
as
guilty
you
not
only
take
away
my
honor
with
that
unjust
sentence
but
my
life
i
come
in
the
name
of
god
and
of
his
son
jesus
christ
to
respectfully
ask
you
to
tell
me
the
crime
of
which
i
am
accused
that
i
may
show
you
my
innocence
i
want
to
be
confronted
with
my
accusers
that
i
may
confound
the
bishop
was
at
first
evidently
embarrassed
by
my
presence
his
lips
were
pale
and
trembling
but
his
eyes
were
dry
and
red
like
the
tiger
s
eyes
in
the
presence
of
his
prey
he
answered
i
can
not
grant
your
request
opening
then
my
new
testament
i
read
receive
no
accusation
against
a
priest
except
under
two
or
three
witnesses
tim
v
i
added
it
was
after
i
had
heard
this
voice
of
god
and
of
his
holy
church
that
i
consented
to
be
a
priest
i
hope
it
is
not
the
intention
of
your
lordship
to
put
aside
this
word
of
god
and
of
his
church
it
is
not
your
intention
to
break
that
solemn
covenant
made
by
christ
with
his
priests
and
sealed
with
his
blood
with
an
air
of
contempt
and
tyrannical
authority
which
i
had
never
suspected
to
be
possible
in
a
bishop
he
answered
i
have
no
lesson
of
scripture
or
canonical
law
to
receive
from
you
sir
and
no
answer
to
give
to
your
impertinent
questions
you
are
interdicted
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
words
uttered
by
the
man
whom
i
was
accustomed
to
consider
as
my
superior
had
a
strange
effect
upon
me
i
felt
as
if
awakening
from
a
long
and
painful
dream
for
the
first
time
i
understood
the
sad
prophecies
of
the
rev
brassard
and
i
realized
the
horror
of
my
position
my
ruin
was
accomplished
though
i
knew
that
that
high
dignitary
was
a
monster
of
hypocrisy
injustice
and
tyranny
he
had
among
the
masses
the
reputation
of
a
saint
his
unjust
sentence
would
be
considered
as
just
and
equitable
by
the
multitude
over
whom
he
was
reigning
supremely
at
a
nod
of
his
head
the
people
would
fall
at
his
feet
and
obey
his
commands
to
crush
me
all
ears
would
be
shut
and
all
hearts
hardened
against
me
in
that
fatal
hour
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
my
moral
strength
and
courage
failed
me
i
felt
as
if
i
had
just
fallen
into
a
bottomless
abyss
out
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
escape
what
would
my
innocence
known
only
to
god
avail
me
when
the
whole
world
would
believe
me
guilty
no
words
can
give
an
idea
of
the
mental
torture
of
that
horrible
hour
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
not
a
word
was
exchanged
between
the
bishop
and
me
he
seemed
very
busy
writing
letters
while
i
was
resting
my
head
between
my
hands
and
shedding
torrents
of
tears
at
last
i
fell
on
my
knees
took
the
hands
of
the
bishop
in
mine
and
with
a
voice
half
choked
with
sighs
i
said
my
lord
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
in
the
presence
of
god
i
swear
that
i
have
done
nothing
which
could
bring
such
a
sentence
against
me
i
again
implore
your
lordship
to
confront
me
with
my
accusers
that
i
may
show
you
my
with
a
savage
insolence
the
bishop
withdrew
his
hands
as
if
i
had
contaminated
them
and
said
after
rising
from
his
chair
you
are
guilty
go
out
of
my
a
thousand
times
since
i
have
thanked
my
god
that
i
had
no
dagger
with
me
for
i
would
have
plunged
it
into
his
heart
but
strange
to
say
the
diabolical
malice
and
dishonesty
of
that
depraved
man
suddenly
brought
back
my
former
and
courage
i
at
once
took
the
stern
resolution
to
face
the
storm
i
felt
in
my
soul
that
giant
strength
which
often
god
himself
implants
in
the
breast
of
the
oppressed
when
he
is
in
the
presence
of
his
merciless
tyrants
it
seemed
that
a
flash
of
lightning
had
passed
through
my
soul
after
having
written
in
letters
of
fire
on
the
walls
of
the
palace
mystery
of
relying
entirely
on
the
god
of
truth
and
justice
who
knew
my
innocence
and
the
great
perversity
of
my
oppressor
i
left
the
room
without
saying
a
word
and
hastened
back
to
longueuil
to
acquaint
the
rev
brassard
with
my
firm
resolution
to
fight
the
bishop
to
the
end
he
burst
into
tears
when
i
told
him
what
had
occurred
in
the
bishop
s
palace
though
innocent
you
are
condemned
he
said
the
infallible
proof
of
your
innocence
is
the
cruel
refusal
of
allowing
you
to
be
confronted
with
your
accusers
were
you
guilty
they
would
be
too
glad
to
show
it
by
confounding
you
before
those
witnesses
but
the
perversity
of
your
accusers
is
so
well
known
that
they
are
ashamed
of
giving
their
names
the
bishop
prefers
to
crush
you
under
the
weight
of
his
unmerited
reputation
for
justice
and
holiness
for
very
few
know
him
as
we
do
my
fear
is
that
he
will
succeed
in
destroying
you
though
innocent
you
are
condemned
and
lost
you
will
never
be
able
to
contend
against
such
a
mighty
my
dear
brassard
you
are
mistaken
i
replied
i
never
was
so
sure
of
coming
out
victorious
from
a
conflict
as
the
monstrous
iniquity
of
the
bishop
carries
its
antidote
with
itself
it
was
not
a
dream
i
saw
when
he
so
ignominiously
turned
me
out
of
his
room
a
flash
of
lightning
passed
before
my
eyes
and
wrote
as
if
on
the
walls
of
the
palace
mystery
of
iniquity
when
canada
the
whole
of
christendom
shall
know
the
infamous
conduct
of
that
dignitary
when
they
shall
see
the
mystery
of
iniquity
which
i
shall
stamp
upon
his
forehead
there
will
be
only
one
cry
of
indignation
against
him
oh
if
i
can
only
find
out
the
names
of
my
accusers
how
i
will
force
that
mighty
tyrant
to
withdraw
that
sentence
at
double
quick
i
am
determined
to
show
not
only
to
canada
but
to
the
whole
world
that
this
infamous
plot
is
but
the
work
of
the
vile
male
and
female
slaves
by
whom
the
bishop
is
surrounded
my
first
thought
was
to
start
immediately
for
chicago
where
bishop
vandeveld
expected
me
but
i
am
resolved
not
to
go
until
i
have
forced
my
merciless
oppressor
to
withdraw
his
unjust
sentence
i
will
immediately
go
to
the
jesuit
college
where
i
propose
spending
the
next
eight
days
in
prayer
and
retreat
the
jesuits
are
the
ablest
men
under
heaven
to
detect
the
most
hidden
things
i
hope
they
will
help
me
to
unearth
that
dark
mystery
of
iniquity
and
expose
it
to
the
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
do
not
fear
the
terrible
storm
which
is
upon
you
and
that
your
sails
are
so
well
trimmed
answered
brassard
you
do
well
in
putting
your
trust
in
god
first
and
in
the
jesuits
afterwards
the
fearless
way
in
which
you
intend
to
meet
the
attacks
of
your
merciless
enemies
will
give
you
an
easy
victory
my
hope
is
that
the
jesuits
will
help
you
to
find
out
the
names
of
your
false
accusers
and
that
you
will
make
use
of
them
to
hurl
back
in
the
face
of
the
bishop
the
shame
and
dishonor
he
had
prepared
for
at
six
in
a
modest
and
ventilated
room
of
the
jesuit
college
i
was
alone
with
the
venerable
schneider
its
director
i
told
him
how
the
bishop
of
montreal
four
years
before
after
giving
up
his
prejudices
against
me
when
i
had
left
the
oblate
had
earnestly
supported
me
in
my
labors
i
acquainted
him
also
with
the
sudden
change
of
those
good
feelings
into
the
most
uncontrollable
hatred
from
the
day
i
had
refused
to
force
chenier
to
become
a
nun
that
he
might
secure
her
fortune
i
told
him
also
how
those
bad
feelings
had
found
new
food
in
my
plan
of
consecrating
the
rest
of
my
life
to
direct
the
tide
of
the
french
catholic
emigration
towards
the
mississippi
valley
i
exposed
to
him
my
suspicions
about
that
miserable
girl
i
had
turned
out
from
my
confessional
i
have
a
double
object
in
view
i
added
the
first
is
to
spend
the
last
eight
days
of
my
residence
in
canada
in
prayer
but
my
second
is
to
ask
the
help
of
your
charity
wisdom
and
experience
in
forcing
the
bishop
to
withdraw
his
unjust
sentence
against
me
i
am
determined
if
he
does
not
withdraw
it
to
denounce
him
before
the
whole
country
and
to
challenge
him
publicly
to
confront
me
with
my
if
you
do
that
answered
schneider
i
fear
lest
you
not
only
do
an
irreparable
damage
to
the
bishop
of
montreal
but
to
our
holy
church
i
replied
our
holy
church
would
indeed
suffer
an
irreparable
damage
if
she
sanctioned
the
infamous
conduct
of
the
bishop
but
this
is
you
are
correct
rejoined
the
jesuit
our
holy
church
can
not
sanction
such
criminal
conduct
she
has
hundreds
of
times
condemned
those
tyrannical
and
unjust
actions
in
other
bishops
such
want
of
common
honesty
and
justice
will
be
condemned
everywhere
as
soon
as
it
is
known
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
is
to
find
out
the
names
of
your
accusers
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
they
are
the
blind
instruments
of
machiavelist
plots
against
you
but
those
plots
have
only
to
be
brought
to
light
to
vanish
away
my
impression
is
that
the
miserable
girl
you
have
so
abruptly
and
so
wisely
turned
out
of
your
confessional
knows
more
than
the
bishop
wants
us
to
find
out
about
the
plots
it
is
a
pity
you
did
not
ask
her
name
and
residence
at
all
events
you
may
rely
on
my
efforts
to
persuade
our
bishop
that
his
personal
interest
as
well
as
the
interest
of
our
holy
religion
is
that
he
should
speedily
withdraw
that
sentence
which
is
a
nullity
by
itself
it
will
not
be
difficult
for
me
to
show
him
that
he
has
fallen
into
the
very
pit
he
has
dug
under
your
feet
he
has
taken
a
position
against
you
which
is
absolutely
untenable
before
your
retreat
is
at
an
end
no
doubt
he
will
be
too
happy
to
make
his
peace
with
you
only
trust
in
god
and
in
the
blessed
virgin
mary
and
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
conflict
our
bishop
has
put
himself
above
all
the
laws
of
man
and
god
to
condemn
the
priest
he
had
himself
officially
named
the
apostle
of
temperance
of
there
is
not
a
single
man
in
the
church
who
will
allow
him
to
stand
on
that
ground
the
soldiers
you
have
enrolled
under
the
holy
banners
of
temperance
will
force
him
to
retract
his
too
hasty
and
unjust
it
would
be
too
long
to
repeat
here
all
the
encouraging
words
which
that
wise
jesuit
uttered
father
schneider
was
a
european
priest
who
was
in
montreal
only
since
won
my
confidence
the
very
first
time
i
met
him
and
i
had
chosen
him
at
once
for
my
confessor
and
adviser
the
third
day
of
my
retreat
father
schneider
came
to
my
room
earlier
than
usual
and
said
i
have
worked
hard
the
last
two
days
to
find
out
the
name
and
residence
of
the
carter
to
whom
that
miserable
girl
spoke
in
the
church
after
you
had
turned
her
out
of
your
confessional
and
i
have
it
if
you
have
no
objection
i
will
send
for
him
he
may
know
that
girl
and
induce
her
to
come
by
all
means
dear
father
i
answered
do
it
without
losing
a
two
hours
later
the
carter
was
with
me
i
recognized
him
as
one
of
those
dear
countrymen
whom
our
society
of
temperance
had
transformed
into
a
new
man
i
asked
him
if
he
remembered
the
name
of
the
girl
who
a
few
days
before
had
spoken
to
him
in
the
church
after
going
out
of
my
confessional
yes
sir
i
know
her
well
she
has
a
very
bad
name
though
she
belongs
to
a
respectable
i
added
do
you
think
you
could
induce
her
to
come
here
by
telling
her
that
a
priest
in
the
jesuit
college
wants
to
see
her
but
do
not
give
her
my
he
answered
nothing
is
more
easy
she
will
be
here
in
a
couple
of
hours
if
i
find
her
at
at
three
the
carter
was
again
knocking
at
my
door
and
said
with
a
low
voice
the
girl
you
want
is
in
the
parlor
she
has
no
idea
you
are
here
for
she
told
me
that
you
were
now
preaching
in
st
constant
she
seems
to
be
very
angry
against
you
and
bitterly
complains
against
your
want
of
courtesy
the
very
first
time
she
went
to
confess
to
is
it
possible
that
she
told
you
that
i
replied
yes
sir
she
told
me
that
to
explain
her
terrible
excitement
when
coming
out
of
your
confessional
the
other
day
she
then
requested
me
to
drive
her
home
she
was
really
beside
herself
and
swore
that
she
would
make
you
pay
for
your
harsh
words
and
rude
manner
towards
her
you
will
do
well
to
be
on
your
guard
with
her
she
is
one
of
the
most
depraved
girls
of
montreal
and
has
a
most
dangerous
tongue
though
to
the
shame
of
our
holy
religion
she
is
daily
seen
in
the
bishop
s
i
immediately
went
to
father
schneider
and
said
my
dear
father
by
the
mercy
of
god
the
girl
we
want
to
see
is
in
the
parlor
by
what
i
have
just
heard
from
the
carter
who
drove
her
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
but
that
she
is
the
one
employed
by
the
bishop
to
slander
me
and
get
a
pretext
for
what
he
has
done
please
come
with
me
to
witness
my
innocence
but
take
your
gospel
ink
paper
and
pen
with
all
right
answered
the
wise
jesuit
two
minutes
later
we
were
in
her
presence
it
is
impossible
to
describe
her
dismay
when
she
saw
me
she
came
near
fainting
i
feared
she
should
not
be
able
to
utter
a
word
i
spoke
to
her
very
kindly
and
ran
to
get
a
glass
of
cold
water
which
did
her
good
when
she
recovered
i
said
to
her
with
a
tone
of
mixed
authority
and
kind
firmness
you
are
here
in
the
presence
of
god
and
two
of
his
priests
that
great
god
will
hear
every
word
which
will
fall
from
your
lips
you
must
speak
the
truth
you
have
denounced
me
to
the
bishop
as
guilty
of
some
great
iniquity
you
are
the
cause
of
my
being
interdicted
you
alone
can
repair
the
injury
you
have
done
me
that
injury
is
very
great
but
it
can
be
easily
repaired
by
you
in
the
presence
of
that
venerable
priest
say
whether
or
not
i
am
guilty
of
the
crime
you
have
brought
to
my
charge
at
these
words
the
unfortunate
girl
burst
into
tears
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
with
a
voice
with
sighs
she
said
no
sir
you
are
not
i
added
confess
another
thing
is
it
not
a
fact
that
you
had
come
to
my
confessional
more
with
the
intention
of
tempting
me
to
sin
than
to
reconcile
yourself
to
god
yes
sir
she
added
this
was
my
wicked
intention
continue
to
tell
the
truth
and
our
great
and
merciful
god
will
forgive
you
is
it
not
to
revenge
yourself
for
my
rebuking
you
that
you
have
brought
the
false
accusations
to
the
bishop
in
order
that
he
might
interdict
me
yes
sir
that
is
the
only
reason
i
had
for
accusing
after
father
schneider
had
made
four
copies
of
those
declarations
signed
by
him
as
witness
and
after
she
had
sworn
on
the
gospel
i
forgave
her
the
injury
she
had
done
me
i
gave
her
some
good
advice
and
dismissed
her
is
it
not
evident
i
said
to
father
schneider
that
our
merciful
god
never
forsakes
those
who
trust
in
him
yes
i
never
saw
the
interposition
of
god
so
marvellously
manifested
as
in
this
perfect
deliverance
from
the
hands
of
your
enemies
but
please
tell
me
why
you
requested
me
to
make
four
copies
of
her
sworn
declaration
of
your
innocence
was
not
one
sufficient
asked
schneider
i
answered
one
of
those
copies
was
for
the
bishop
another
will
remain
in
your
hands
brassard
will
have
one
and
i
need
one
for
myself
for
the
dishonesty
of
the
bishop
is
so
evident
to
me
now
that
i
think
him
able
to
destroy
the
copy
i
will
send
him
with
the
hope
after
its
destruction
of
keeping
me
at
his
feet
if
he
does
that
new
act
of
iniquity
i
will
confound
him
with
the
three
other
authentic
copies
which
will
remain
besides
this
unfortunate
girl
may
die
sooner
than
we
expect
in
that
case
i
would
find
myself
again
with
the
bishop
s
knife
on
my
throat
if
i
had
no
other
retractation
to
the
perjured
declaration
which
he
has
persuaded
her
to
give
you
are
right
replied
father
schneider
now
the
only
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
send
that
retractation
to
the
bishop
with
a
firm
and
polite
request
to
retract
his
unjust
sentence
against
you
let
me
do
the
rest
with
him
the
battle
is
over
it
has
been
fierce
but
short
however
thanks
be
to
god
you
have
a
most
complete
victory
over
your
unjust
aggressors
the
bishop
will
do
all
in
his
power
no
doubt
to
make
you
forget
this
darkest
page
of
his
the
shrewd
jesuit
was
correct
in
his
previsions
never
did
any
bishop
receive
me
with
so
many
marks
not
only
with
kindness
but
i
dare
say
of
respect
than
bishop
bourget
when
after
my
retreat
i
went
to
take
leave
of
him
before
my
departure
from
canada
to
the
united
states
i
trust
my
lord
i
said
that
i
can
hope
to
possess
the
confidence
and
friendly
feelings
of
your
lordship
certainly
my
dear
chiniquy
certainly
you
possess
my
full
confidence
and
friendship
i
dare
say
more
you
possess
my
most
sincere
gratitude
for
what
you
have
done
in
my
i
answered
i
am
much
obliged
to
your
lordship
for
this
expression
of
your
kind
feelings
but
now
i
have
two
new
favors
to
ask
from
your
lordship
the
first
is
a
written
document
expressive
of
those
kind
feelings
the
second
is
a
chalice
from
your
hands
to
offer
the
holy
sacrifice
of
mass
the
rest
of
my
i
will
grant
your
request
with
the
utmost
pleasure
answered
the
bishop
and
without
losing
a
moment
he
wrote
the
following
letter
which
i
reproduce
here
on
account
of
its
importance
translation
montreal
sir
request
me
to
give
you
permission
to
leave
my
diocese
in
order
to
go
and
offer
your
services
to
the
bishop
of
chicago
as
you
still
belong
to
the
diocese
of
quebec
i
think
you
ought
to
address
yourself
to
my
lord
of
quebec
to
get
the
extract
you
want
as
for
me
i
can
not
but
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
in
our
midst
and
in
my
gratitude
towards
you
i
wish
you
the
most
abundant
blessing
from
heaven
every
day
of
my
life
i
will
remember
you
you
will
always
be
in
my
heart
and
i
hope
that
on
some
future
day
the
providence
of
god
will
give
me
some
opportunity
of
showing
you
all
the
feelings
of
gratitude
i
feel
towards
you
i
remain
your
most
obedient
servant
of
rev
chiniquy
though
that
letter
was
a
most
perfect
recantation
of
all
he
had
said
and
done
against
me
and
was
of
immense
value
to
me
in
such
circumstances
the
bishop
added
to
its
importance
by
the
exceedingly
kind
manner
in
which
he
handed
it
to
me
as
he
was
going
into
another
room
he
said
i
will
give
you
the
silver
chalice
you
want
to
offer
the
holy
sacrifice
of
mass
the
rest
of
your
but
he
came
back
and
said
my
secretary
is
absent
and
has
the
key
of
the
trunk
which
contains
those
it
makes
no
difference
my
lord
i
replied
please
order
your
secretary
to
put
that
chalice
in
the
hands
of
rev
brassard
who
will
forward
it
with
a
box
of
books
which
he
has
to
send
me
to
chicago
next
the
bishop
very
kindly
promised
to
do
so
and
he
fulfilled
his
promise
the
next
day
the
precious
gift
was
put
in
the
hands
of
brassard
in
presence
of
several
priests
it
was
sent
the
following
week
to
chicago
where
i
got
it
and
that
fine
silver
chalice
is
still
in
my
possession
i
then
fell
on
my
knees
and
said
my
lord
i
am
just
leaving
canada
for
the
far
west
please
give
me
your
he
blessed
me
and
pressed
me
to
his
heart
with
a
tenderness
of
a
father
saying
may
god
almighty
bless
you
wherever
you
go
and
in
everything
you
do
till
the
end
of
your
chapter
address
presented
me
at
arrive
at
select
the
spot
for
my
build
the
first
and
opposition
of
the
priests
of
bourbonnais
and
success
of
the
colony
though
i
had
kept
my
departure
from
canada
as
secret
as
possible
it
had
been
suspected
by
many
and
brassard
unable
to
resist
the
desire
that
his
people
should
give
me
the
expression
of
their
kind
feelings
had
let
the
secret
slip
from
his
lips
two
days
before
i
left
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
a
few
hours
before
my
taking
leave
of
him
to
see
his
whole
parish
gathered
at
the
door
of
his
parsonage
to
present
me
the
following
address
to
the
rev
father
chiniquy
venerable
sir
is
only
three
years
since
we
presented
you
your
portrait
not
only
as
an
expression
of
our
gratitude
for
your
labors
and
success
in
the
cause
of
temperance
in
our
midst
but
also
as
a
memorial
which
would
tell
our
grandchildren
the
good
you
have
done
to
our
country
we
were
then
far
from
thinking
that
we
were
so
near
the
day
when
we
would
have
the
sorrow
to
see
you
separating
yourself
from
us
your
unforeseen
exit
from
canada
fills
us
with
a
regret
and
sadness
which
is
increased
by
the
fear
we
have
that
the
reform
you
have
started
and
so
gloriously
established
everywhere
will
suffer
from
your
absence
may
our
merciful
god
grant
that
your
faithful
may
continue
it
and
walk
in
your
footsteps
while
we
submit
to
the
decrees
of
providence
we
promise
that
we
will
never
forget
the
great
things
you
have
done
for
the
prosperity
of
our
country
your
likeness
which
is
in
every
canadian
family
will
tell
to
the
future
generations
what
father
chiniquy
has
done
for
canada
we
console
ourselves
by
the
assurance
that
wherever
you
go
you
will
raise
the
glorious
banners
of
temperance
among
those
of
our
countrymen
who
are
scattered
in
the
land
of
exile
may
those
brethren
put
on
your
forehead
the
crown
of
immortality
which
you
have
so
well
deserved
for
your
noble
work
in
our
midst
signed
brassard
and
hicks
and
others
i
answered
gentlemen
thank
you
for
the
honor
you
do
me
by
your
address
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
the
more
i
look
upon
the
incalculable
good
resulting
from
the
temperance
reform
i
have
established
nearly
from
one
end
of
canada
to
the
other
the
more
i
would
deceive
myself
were
i
to
attribute
to
myself
the
whole
merit
of
that
blessed
work
if
our
god
has
chosen
me
his
so
feeble
servant
as
the
instrument
of
his
infinite
mercies
towards
our
dear
country
it
is
because
he
wanted
us
to
understand
that
he
alone
could
make
the
marvellous
change
we
see
everywhere
and
that
we
shall
give
all
the
glory
to
him
it
is
more
to
the
fervent
prayers
and
to
the
good
examples
of
our
venerable
bishops
and
curates
than
to
my
feeble
efforts
that
we
owe
the
triumph
of
temperance
in
canada
and
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
that
holy
cause
will
lose
nothing
by
my
absence
our
merciful
god
has
called
me
to
another
field
i
have
heard
his
voice
though
it
is
a
great
sacrifice
for
me
to
leave
my
own
beloved
country
i
must
go
to
work
in
the
midst
of
a
new
people
in
the
distant
lands
of
illinois
from
many
parts
of
europe
and
canada
multitudes
are
rushing
towards
the
western
territories
of
the
united
states
to
secure
to
their
families
the
incalculable
treasures
which
the
good
providence
of
god
has
scattered
over
those
broad
prairies
those
emigrants
are
in
need
of
priests
they
are
like
those
little
ones
of
whom
god
speaks
in
his
word
who
wanted
bread
and
had
nobody
to
give
them
any
i
have
heard
their
cries
i
have
seen
their
and
in
spite
of
the
great
sacrifice
i
am
called
upon
to
make
i
must
bless
the
good
master
who
calls
me
to
work
in
that
vineyard
planted
by
his
own
hands
in
those
distant
lands
if
anything
can
diminish
the
sadness
of
my
feelings
when
i
bid
adieu
to
my
countrymen
it
is
the
assurance
given
me
by
the
noble
people
of
longueuil
that
i
have
in
canada
many
friends
whose
fervent
prayers
will
constantly
ascend
to
the
throne
of
grace
to
bring
the
benedictions
of
heaven
upon
me
wherever
i
go
chiniquy
i
arrived
at
chicago
on
the
of
october
and
spent
six
days
with
bishop
vandeveld
in
maturing
the
plans
of
our
catholic
colonization
he
gave
me
the
wisest
advice
with
the
most
extensive
powers
which
a
bishop
can
give
a
priest
and
urged
me
to
begin
at
once
the
work
by
selecting
the
most
suitable
spot
for
such
an
important
and
vast
prospect
my
heart
was
filled
with
uncontrollable
emotions
when
the
hour
came
to
leave
my
superior
and
go
to
the
conquest
of
the
magnificent
state
of
illinois
for
the
benefit
of
my
church
i
fell
at
his
knees
to
ask
his
benediction
and
requested
him
never
to
forget
me
in
his
prayers
he
was
not
less
affected
than
i
was
and
pressing
me
to
his
bosom
bathed
my
face
with
his
tears
and
blessed
me
it
took
me
three
days
to
cross
the
prairies
from
chicago
to
bourbonnais
those
prairies
were
then
a
vast
solitude
with
almost
impassable
roads
at
the
invitation
of
their
priest
courjeault
several
people
had
come
long
distances
to
receive
and
overwhelm
me
with
the
public
expressions
of
their
joy
and
respect
after
a
few
days
of
rest
in
the
midst
of
their
interesting
young
colony
i
explained
to
courjeault
that
having
been
sent
by
the
bishop
to
found
a
settlement
of
roman
catholic
emigrants
on
a
sufficiently
grand
scale
to
rule
the
government
of
illinois
it
was
my
duty
to
go
further
south
in
order
to
find
the
most
suitable
place
for
the
first
village
i
intended
to
raise
but
to
my
unspeakable
regret
i
saw
that
my
proposition
filled
the
heart
of
that
unfortunate
priest
with
the
most
bitter
feelings
of
jealousy
and
hatred
it
had
been
just
the
same
thing
with
rev
lebel
at
chicago
the
very
moment
i
told
him
the
object
of
my
coming
to
illinois
i
felt
the
same
spirit
of
jealousy
had
turned
him
into
an
implacable
enemy
i
had
expected
very
different
things
from
those
two
priests
for
whom
i
had
entertained
till
then
most
sincere
sentiments
of
esteem
so
long
as
they
were
under
the
impression
that
i
had
left
canada
to
help
them
increase
their
small
congregations
by
inducing
the
emigrants
to
settle
among
them
they
loaded
me
both
in
public
and
private
with
marks
of
their
esteem
but
the
moment
they
saw
that
i
was
going
to
found
in
the
very
heart
of
illinois
settlements
on
such
a
large
scale
they
banded
together
to
paralyze
and
ruin
my
efforts
had
i
suspected
such
opposition
from
the
very
men
on
whose
moral
help
i
had
relied
for
the
success
of
my
colonizing
schemes
i
would
have
never
left
canada
for
illinois
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
stop
my
onward
march
trusting
in
god
alone
for
success
i
felt
that
those
two
men
were
to
be
put
among
those
unforeseen
obstacles
which
heaven
wanted
me
to
overcome
if
i
could
not
avoid
them
i
persuaded
six
of
the
most
respectable
citizens
of
bourbonnais
to
accompany
me
in
three
wagons
in
search
of
the
best
site
for
the
center
of
my
future
colony
i
had
a
compass
to
guide
me
through
those
vast
prairies
which
were
spread
before
me
like
a
boundless
ocean
i
wanted
to
select
the
highest
point
in
illinois
for
my
first
town
in
order
to
secure
the
purest
air
and
water
for
the
new
emigrants
i
was
fortunate
enough
under
the
guidance
of
god
to
succeed
better
than
i
expected
for
the
government
surveyors
have
lately
acknowledged
that
the
village
of
anne
occupies
the
very
highest
point
of
that
splendid
state
to
my
great
surprise
ten
days
after
i
had
selected
that
spot
fifty
families
from
canada
had
planted
their
tents
around
mine
on
the
beautiful
site
which
forms
the
town
of
anne
we
were
at
the
end
of
november
and
though
the
weather
was
still
mild
i
felt
i
had
not
an
hour
to
lose
in
order
to
secure
shelter
for
every
one
of
those
families
before
the
cold
winds
and
chilly
rains
of
winter
should
spread
sickness
and
death
among
them
the
greater
part
were
illiterate
and
poor
people
without
any
idea
of
the
dangers
and
incredible
difficulties
of
establishing
a
new
settlement
where
everything
had
to
be
created
there
were
at
first
only
two
small
houses
one
by
and
the
other
by
feet
to
lodge
us
with
the
rest
of
my
dear
emigrants
wrapped
in
buffalo
robes
with
my
overcoat
for
my
pillow
i
slept
soundly
many
nights
on
the
bare
floor
during
the
three
months
which
it
took
to
get
my
first
house
erected
having
taken
the
census
of
the
people
on
the
first
of
december
i
found
two
hundred
souls
one
hundred
of
whom
were
adults
i
said
to
them
there
are
not
three
of
you
if
left
alone
able
to
prepare
a
shelter
for
your
families
this
winter
but
if
forgetting
yourselves
you
work
for
each
other
as
true
friends
and
brethren
you
will
increase
your
strength
tenfold
and
in
a
few
weeks
there
will
be
a
sufficient
number
of
small
but
solid
buildings
to
protect
you
against
the
storms
and
snow
of
the
winter
which
is
fast
coming
upon
us
let
us
go
to
the
forest
together
and
cut
the
wood
and
we
will
draw
that
timber
to
one
of
the
lots
you
have
selected
and
you
will
see
with
what
marvellous
speed
the
house
will
be
raised
if
your
hands
and
hearts
are
perfectly
united
to
work
for
each
other
under
the
eyes
and
for
the
love
of
the
merciful
god
who
gives
us
this
splendid
country
for
our
inheritage
but
before
going
to
the
forest
let
us
kneel
down
to
ask
our
heavenly
father
to
bless
the
work
of
our
hands
and
grant
us
to
be
of
one
mind
and
one
heart
and
to
protect
us
against
the
too
common
accidents
of
those
forests
and
building
we
all
knelt
on
the
grass
and
as
much
with
our
tears
as
with
our
lips
we
sent
to
the
a
prayer
which
was
surely
heard
by
the
one
who
said
ask
and
you
will
receive
and
we
started
for
the
forest
the
readers
would
scarcely
believe
me
were
i
to
tell
them
with
what
marvellous
rapidity
the
first
forty
small
but
neat
houses
were
put
up
on
our
beautiful
prairies
whilst
the
men
were
cutting
timber
and
raising
one
another
s
houses
with
a
unity
a
joy
a
and
rapidity
which
many
times
drew
from
me
tears
of
admiration
the
women
would
prepare
the
common
meals
we
obtained
our
flour
and
pork
from
bourbonnais
and
momence
at
a
very
low
price
and
as
i
was
a
good
shot
one
or
two
friends
and
i
used
to
kill
every
day
enough
prairie
chickens
quails
ducks
wild
geese
brants
and
deer
to
feed
more
people
than
there
were
in
our
young
colony
those
delicious
viands
which
would
have
been
welcomed
on
the
table
of
the
king
and
which
would
have
satisfied
the
most
fastidious
gourmand
caused
many
of
my
poor
dear
emigrants
to
say
our
daily
and
most
common
meals
here
are
more
sumptuous
and
delicate
than
the
richest
ones
in
canada
and
they
cost
almost
when
i
saw
that
a
sufficient
number
of
houses
had
been
built
to
give
shelter
to
every
one
of
the
first
emigrants
i
called
a
meeting
and
said
my
dear
friends
by
the
great
mercy
of
god
and
in
almost
a
miraculous
way
thanks
be
to
the
unity
and
charity
which
have
bound
you
to
each
other
till
now
as
members
of
the
same
family
you
are
in
your
little
but
happy
homes
and
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
winds
and
snow
of
the
winter
i
think
that
my
duty
now
is
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
necessity
of
building
a
house
the
upper
part
will
be
used
as
the
for
your
children
on
week
days
and
for
a
chapel
on
sundays
and
the
lower
part
will
be
my
parsonage
i
will
furnish
the
money
for
the
flooring
shingles
the
nails
and
the
windows
and
you
will
give
your
work
gratis
to
cut
and
draw
the
timber
and
put
it
up
i
will
also
pay
the
architect
without
asking
a
cent
from
you
it
is
quite
time
to
provide
a
school
for
your
children
for
in
this
country
as
in
any
other
place
there
is
no
possible
prosperity
or
happiness
for
a
people
if
they
neglect
the
education
of
their
children
now
we
are
too
numerous
to
continue
having
our
sabbath
worship
in
any
private
house
as
we
have
done
till
now
what
do
you
think
of
this
they
unanimously
answered
yes
after
you
have
worked
so
hard
to
give
a
home
to
every
one
of
us
it
is
just
that
we
should
help
you
to
make
one
for
yourself
we
are
happy
to
hear
that
it
is
your
intention
to
secure
a
good
education
for
our
children
let
us
begin
the
work
at
this
was
the
of
january
the
sun
was
as
warm
as
on
a
beautiful
day
of
may
in
canada
we
again
fell
upon
our
knees
to
implore
the
help
of
god
and
sang
a
beautiful
french
hymn
the
next
day
we
were
men
in
a
neighboring
forest
felling
the
great
oaks
and
on
the
of
april
only
three
months
later
that
fine
building
nearly
forty
feet
square
was
blessed
by
bishop
vandeveld
it
was
surmounted
by
a
nice
steeple
thirty
feet
high
in
which
we
had
put
a
bell
weighing
pounds
whose
solemn
sound
was
to
tell
our
joys
and
sorrows
over
the
boundless
prairies
on
that
day
instead
of
being
only
fifty
families
as
at
the
last
census
we
numbered
more
than
one
hundred
among
whom
more
than
were
adults
the
chapel
which
we
thought
at
first
would
be
too
large
was
filled
to
its
utmost
capacity
on
the
day
of
its
consecration
to
god
not
a
month
later
we
had
to
speak
of
making
an
addition
of
forty
feet
more
which
when
finished
six
months
later
was
found
to
be
still
insufficient
for
the
accommodation
of
the
constantly
increasing
flood
of
immigration
which
came
not
only
from
canada
but
from
belgium
and
france
it
soon
became
necessary
to
make
a
new
center
and
expand
the
limits
of
my
first
colony
which
i
did
by
planting
a
cross
at
l
erable
about
fifteen
miles
southwest
of
anne
and
another
at
a
place
we
call
mary
twelve
miles
southeast
in
the
county
of
iroquois
these
settlements
were
soon
filled
for
that
very
spring
more
than
one
thousand
new
families
came
from
canada
to
join
us
no
words
can
express
the
joy
of
my
heart
when
i
saw
with
what
rapidity
my
then
so
dear
church
of
rome
was
taking
possession
of
those
magnificent
lands
and
how
soon
she
would
be
unrivaled
mistress
not
only
of
the
state
of
illinois
but
of
the
whole
valley
of
the
mississippi
but
the
ways
of
men
are
not
the
ways
of
god
i
had
been
called
by
the
bishops
of
rome
to
illinois
to
extend
the
power
of
that
church
but
my
god
had
called
me
there
that
i
might
give
to
that
church
the
most
deadly
blow
she
has
ever
received
on
this
continent
my
task
is
now
to
tell
my
readers
how
the
god
of
truth
and
light
and
life
broke
one
after
another
all
the
charmed
bonds
by
which
i
was
kept
a
slave
at
the
feet
of
the
pope
and
how
he
opened
my
eyes
and
those
of
my
people
to
the
unsuspected
and
untold
abominations
of
romanism
chapter
li
intrigues
impostures
and
criminal
life
of
the
priest
in
of
the
people
ignominiously
turn
out
the
criminal
priest
from
their
in
the
church
of
rome
seriously
shaken
please
accompany
me
to
bourbonnais
i
have
to
confer
with
you
and
the
rev
courjeault
on
important
matters
said
the
bishop
half
an
hour
before
leaving
anne
after
having
blessed
the
chapel
i
intended
my
lord
to
ask
your
lordship
to
grant
me
that
honor
before
you
offered
it
i
answered
two
hours
of
good
driving
took
us
to
the
parsonage
of
the
rev
courjeault
who
had
prepared
a
sumptuous
dinner
to
which
several
of
the
principal
citizens
of
bourbonnais
had
been
invited
when
all
the
guests
had
departed
and
the
bishop
courjeault
and
i
were
alone
he
drew
from
his
trunk
a
bundle
of
weekly
papers
of
montreal
canada
in
which
several
letters
very
insulting
and
compromising
for
the
bishop
were
published
signed
showing
them
to
me
he
said
mr
chiniquy
can
i
know
the
reason
you
had
for
writing
such
insulting
things
against
your
bishop
my
lord
i
answered
i
have
no
words
to
express
my
surprise
and
indignation
when
i
read
those
letters
but
thanks
be
to
god
i
am
not
the
author
of
those
infamous
writings
i
would
rather
have
my
right
hand
cut
off
than
to
allow
it
to
pen
such
false
and
perfidious
things
against
you
or
any
one
do
you
assure
me
that
you
are
not
the
writer
of
the
letters
are
you
positive
in
that
denegation
and
do
you
know
the
contents
of
these
lying
communications
replied
the
bishop
yes
my
lord
i
know
the
contents
of
these
communications
i
have
read
them
several
times
with
supreme
disgust
and
indignation
and
i
positively
assert
that
i
never
wrote
a
single
line
of
then
can
you
tell
me
who
did
write
them
said
the
bishop
i
answered
please
my
lord
put
that
question
to
the
rev
courjeault
he
is
more
able
than
any
one
to
satisfy
your
lordship
on
that
i
looked
at
courjeault
with
an
indignant
air
which
told
him
that
he
could
not
any
longer
wear
the
mask
behind
which
he
had
concealed
himself
for
the
last
three
or
four
months
the
eyes
of
the
bishop
were
also
turned
and
firmly
fixed
on
the
wretched
priest
no
never
had
i
seen
anything
so
strange
as
the
countenance
of
that
guilty
man
his
face
though
usually
ugly
suddenly
took
a
cadaverous
appearance
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
floor
as
if
unable
to
move
the
only
signs
of
life
left
in
him
were
given
by
his
knees
which
were
shaking
convulsively
and
by
the
big
drops
of
sweat
rolling
down
his
unwashed
face
for
i
must
say
here
that
with
very
few
exceptions
that
priest
was
the
dirtiest
man
i
ever
saw
the
bishop
with
unutterable
expressions
of
indignation
exclaimed
mr
courjeault
you
are
the
writer
of
those
infamous
and
slanderous
letters
three
times
you
have
written
and
twice
you
told
me
verbally
that
they
were
coming
from
chiniquy
i
do
not
ask
you
if
you
are
the
author
of
these
slanders
against
me
i
see
it
written
in
your
face
your
malice
against
chiniquy
is
really
diabolical
you
wanted
to
ruin
him
in
my
estimation
as
well
as
in
that
of
his
countrymen
and
to
succeed
the
better
in
that
plot
you
publish
the
most
egregious
falsehoods
against
me
in
the
canadian
press
to
induce
me
to
denounce
chiniquy
as
an
impostor
how
is
it
possible
that
a
priest
can
so
completely
give
himself
to
the
devil
addressing
me
the
bishop
said
mr
chiniquy
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
believed
and
repeated
that
you
were
depraved
enough
to
write
those
calumnies
against
your
bishop
i
was
deceived
by
that
deceitful
man
i
will
immediately
retract
what
i
have
written
and
said
against
then
addressing
courjeault
he
again
said
the
least
punishment
i
can
give
you
is
to
turn
you
out
of
my
diocese
and
write
to
all
the
bishops
of
america
that
you
are
the
vilest
priest
i
ever
saw
that
they
may
never
give
you
any
position
on
this
these
last
words
had
hardly
fallen
from
the
lips
of
the
bishop
when
courjeault
fell
on
his
knees
before
me
and
bathing
with
his
tears
my
hands
which
he
was
convulsively
pressing
in
his
said
dear
chiniquy
i
see
the
greatness
of
my
iniquity
against
you
and
against
our
common
bishop
for
the
dear
saviour
jesus
sake
forgive
me
i
take
god
to
witness
that
you
will
never
have
a
more
devoted
friend
than
i
will
be
and
you
my
lord
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
i
thank
god
that
my
malice
and
my
great
sin
against
both
you
and
chiniquy
is
known
and
punished
at
once
however
in
the
name
of
our
crucified
saviour
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
god
knows
that
hereafter
you
will
not
have
a
more
obedient
and
devoted
priest
than
it
was
a
most
touching
spectacle
to
see
the
tears
and
hear
the
sobs
of
that
repentant
sinner
i
could
not
contain
myself
nor
refrain
from
tears
they
were
mingled
with
those
of
that
returning
stray
sheep
i
answered
yes
courjeault
i
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
as
i
wish
my
merciful
god
to
forgive
me
my
sins
may
the
god
who
sees
your
repentance
forgive
you
also
bishop
vandeveld
who
was
gifted
with
a
most
sensitive
and
kind
nature
was
also
shedding
tears
when
i
lifted
up
courjeault
to
press
him
to
my
heart
and
to
tell
him
again
with
my
voice
choked
with
sobs
i
forgive
you
most
sincerely
as
i
want
to
be
he
asked
me
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
must
i
forgive
also
and
can
i
continue
to
keep
him
at
the
head
of
this
important
mission
yes
my
lord
please
forgive
and
forget
the
errors
of
that
dear
brother
he
has
already
done
so
much
good
to
my
countrymen
of
bourbonnais
i
pledge
myself
that
he
will
hereafter
be
one
of
your
best
and
the
bishop
forgave
him
after
some
very
appropriate
and
paternal
advice
admirably
mixed
with
mercy
and
firmness
it
was
then
about
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
we
separated
to
say
our
vespers
and
matins
prayers
which
took
nearly
an
hour
i
had
just
finished
reciting
them
in
the
garden
when
i
saw
the
rev
courjeault
walking
from
the
church
towards
me
but
his
steps
were
uncertain
as
one
distracted
or
half
drunk
i
was
puzzled
at
the
sight
for
he
was
a
strong
teetotaler
and
i
knew
he
had
no
strong
drink
in
the
church
he
advanced
three
or
four
steps
then
retreated
at
last
he
came
very
near
but
his
face
had
such
an
expression
of
terror
and
sadness
that
he
was
hardly
recognizable
he
muttered
something
that
i
could
not
understand
please
repeat
your
sentence
i
said
to
him
i
did
not
understand
he
then
put
his
hands
on
his
face
and
again
muttered
something
his
voice
was
drowned
in
his
tears
and
sobs
supposing
that
he
was
coming
to
ask
me
again
to
pardon
his
past
malice
and
calumnies
against
me
i
felt
an
unspeakable
compassion
for
him
as
there
were
a
couple
of
seats
near
by
i
said
to
him
my
dear
courjeault
come
and
sit
here
with
me
and
do
not
think
any
more
of
what
god
almighty
has
blotted
out
with
the
blood
of
his
son
i
will
never
think
any
more
of
your
momentary
errors
you
may
look
upon
me
as
your
most
devoted
dear
chiniquy
he
answered
i
have
to
reveal
to
you
another
dark
mystery
of
my
miserable
life
since
more
than
a
year
i
have
lived
with
the
beadle
s
daughter
as
if
she
were
my
wife
she
has
just
told
me
that
she
is
to
become
a
mother
in
a
few
days
and
that
i
have
to
see
to
that
and
give
her
she
threatens
to
denounce
me
publicly
to
the
bishop
and
people
if
i
do
not
support
her
and
her
offspring
would
it
not
be
better
for
me
to
flee
away
this
night
and
go
back
to
france
to
live
in
my
own
family
and
conceal
my
shame
sometimes
i
am
even
tempted
to
throw
myself
in
the
river
to
put
an
end
to
my
miserable
and
dishonored
existence
do
you
think
that
the
bishop
would
forgive
this
new
crime
if
i
threw
myself
at
his
feet
and
asked
pardon
would
he
give
me
some
other
place
in
his
vast
diocese
where
my
misfortunes
and
my
sins
are
not
known
please
tell
me
what
to
i
remained
absolutely
stupefied
and
did
not
know
what
to
answer
though
i
had
compassion
for
the
unfortunate
man
i
must
confess
that
this
new
development
of
his
hypocrisy
and
rascality
filled
me
with
an
unspeakable
horror
and
disgust
he
had
till
then
wrapped
himself
in
such
a
thick
mantle
of
deception
that
many
of
his
people
looked
upon
him
as
an
angel
of
purity
his
infamies
were
so
well
concealed
under
an
exterior
of
extreme
moral
rigidity
that
several
of
his
parishioners
looked
upon
him
as
a
saint
whose
relics
could
perform
miracles
not
long
before
two
young
couples
of
the
best
families
of
bourbonnais
having
danced
in
a
respectable
social
gathering
had
been
condemned
by
him
and
compelled
to
ask
pardon
publicly
in
the
church
this
pharisaical
rigidity
caused
the
secret
vices
of
that
priest
to
be
still
more
conspicuous
and
scandalous
i
felt
that
the
scandal
which
would
follow
the
publication
of
this
mystery
of
iniquity
would
be
awful
that
it
would
even
cause
many
forever
to
lose
faith
in
our
church
so
many
sad
thoughts
filled
my
mind
that
i
was
confused
and
unable
to
give
him
any
advice
i
answered
your
misfortune
is
really
great
if
the
bishop
were
not
here
i
might
perhaps
tell
you
my
mind
about
the
best
thing
to
do
just
now
but
the
bishop
is
here
he
is
the
only
man
to
whom
you
have
to
go
to
know
how
to
come
out
of
the
bottomless
abyss
into
which
you
have
fallen
he
is
your
proper
counsellor
go
and
tell
him
frankly
everything
and
follow
his
with
staggering
step
and
in
such
deep
emotions
that
his
sobs
and
cries
could
be
heard
for
quite
a
distance
he
went
to
the
bishop
i
remained
alone
half
petrified
at
what
i
had
heard
half
an
hour
later
the
bishop
came
to
me
he
was
pale
and
his
eyes
reddened
with
tears
he
said
to
me
mr
chiniquy
what
an
awful
scandal
what
a
new
disgrace
for
our
holy
church
that
courjeault
whom
i
thought
till
to
be
one
of
my
best
priests
is
an
incarnate
devil
what
shall
i
do
with
him
please
help
me
by
your
advice
tell
me
what
you
consider
the
best
way
of
preventing
the
scandal
and
protecting
the
faith
of
the
good
people
against
the
destructive
storm
which
is
coming
upon
my
dear
bishop
i
answered
the
more
i
consider
these
scandals
here
the
less
i
see
how
we
can
save
the
church
from
becoming
a
dreadful
wreck
i
feel
too
much
the
responsibility
of
my
advice
to
give
it
let
your
lordship
guided
by
the
spirit
of
god
do
what
you
consider
the
best
for
the
honor
of
the
church
and
the
salvation
of
so
many
souls
which
are
in
danger
of
perishing
when
this
scandal
becomes
known
for
me
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
to
conceal
my
face
with
shame
go
back
to
my
young
colony
to
pray
and
weep
and
the
bishop
replied
here
is
what
i
intend
to
do
courjeault
tells
me
that
there
is
not
the
least
suspicion
among
the
people
of
his
sin
and
that
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
send
that
girl
to
the
house
provided
in
canada
for
priests
offenses
without
awakening
any
suspicion
he
seems
so
penitent
that
i
hope
hereafter
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
he
will
now
live
the
life
of
a
good
priest
here
without
giving
any
scandal
but
if
i
remove
him
then
there
will
be
some
suspicions
of
his
fall
and
the
awful
scandal
we
want
to
avoid
will
come
please
lend
me
which
i
will
give
to
courjeault
to
send
that
girl
to
canada
as
soon
as
possible
and
he
will
continue
here
to
work
with
wisdom
after
this
terrible
trial
what
do
you
think
of
that
plan
if
your
lordship
is
sure
of
the
conversion
of
courjeault
and
that
there
is
no
danger
of
his
great
iniquity
being
known
by
the
people
evidently
the
wisest
thing
you
can
do
is
to
send
that
girl
to
canada
and
keep
courjeault
here
though
i
see
great
dangers
even
in
that
way
of
dealing
in
this
sad
affair
but
unfortunately
i
have
not
a
cent
in
hand
and
i
can
not
lend
you
the
you
then
said
the
bishop
i
will
give
a
draft
on
a
bank
of
chicago
but
you
must
endorse
i
have
no
objection
my
lord
to
endorse
any
draft
signed
by
your
lordship
i
replied
though
it
was
late
in
the
day
and
that
i
had
at
first
proposed
to
spend
the
night
i
came
back
to
my
dear
colony
of
anne
bourbonnais
appeared
to
me
like
a
burning
house
in
the
cellar
of
which
there
was
a
barrel
of
powder
from
which
one
could
not
keep
himself
too
far
away
five
days
later
four
of
the
principal
citizens
of
that
interesting
but
sorely
tried
place
knocked
at
my
door
they
were
sent
as
a
deputation
from
the
whole
village
to
ask
me
what
to
do
about
their
curate
courjeault
they
told
me
that
several
of
them
had
long
since
suspected
what
was
going
on
between
that
priest
and
the
beadle
s
daughter
but
they
had
kept
that
secret
however
yesterday
they
said
the
eyes
of
the
parish
had
been
opened
to
the
awful
scandal
the
disgusting
demonstrations
and
attention
of
the
curate
when
the
victim
of
his
lust
took
the
diligence
left
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
any
one
that
she
is
to
have
a
child
in
montreal
now
chiniquy
we
are
sent
here
to
ask
your
advice
please
tell
us
what
to
my
dear
friends
i
answered
it
is
not
from
me
but
from
our
common
bishop
that
you
must
ask
what
is
to
be
done
in
such
deplorable
but
they
replied
would
you
not
be
kind
enough
to
come
to
bourbonnais
with
us
and
go
to
our
unfortunate
priest
to
tell
him
that
his
criminal
conduct
is
known
by
the
whole
people
and
that
we
can
not
decently
keep
him
a
day
longer
as
our
christian
teacher
he
has
rendered
us
great
services
in
the
past
which
we
will
never
forget
we
do
not
want
to
abuse
or
insult
him
in
any
way
though
guilty
he
is
still
a
priest
the
only
favor
we
ask
from
him
now
is
that
he
quits
the
place
without
noise
and
scandal
in
the
night
to
avoid
any
disagreeable
demonstrations
which
might
come
from
his
personal
enemies
whom
his
pharisaical
rigidity
has
made
pretty
numerous
and
i
do
not
see
any
reason
to
refuse
you
that
favor
i
answered
three
hours
later
in
the
presence
of
those
four
gentlemen
i
was
delivering
my
sad
message
to
the
unfortunate
curate
he
received
it
as
his
death
warrant
but
he
was
humble
and
submitted
to
his
fate
after
spending
four
hours
with
us
in
settling
his
affairs
he
fell
on
his
knees
with
torrents
of
tears
he
asked
pardon
for
the
scandal
he
had
given
and
requested
us
to
ask
pardon
from
the
whole
parish
and
at
o
clock
at
night
he
left
for
chicago
that
hour
was
a
sad
one
indeed
for
us
all
but
my
god
had
a
still
sadder
hour
in
store
for
me
the
people
of
bourbonnais
had
requested
me
to
give
them
some
religious
evening
services
the
next
week
and
i
was
just
at
the
end
of
one
of
them
the
of
may
when
suddenly
the
rev
courjeault
entered
the
church
walked
through
the
crowd
saluting
this
one
smiling
on
that
one
and
pressing
the
hands
of
many
his
face
bore
the
marks
of
impudence
and
debauchery
from
one
end
of
the
church
to
the
other
a
whisper
of
amazement
and
indignation
was
heard
mr
courjeault
mr
courjeault
great
god
what
does
this
mean
i
observed
that
he
was
advancing
towards
me
probably
with
the
intention
of
shaking
hands
before
the
people
but
i
did
not
give
him
time
to
do
it
i
left
by
the
back
door
and
went
to
the
parsonage
which
was
only
a
few
steps
distant
he
then
went
back
to
the
door
to
have
a
talk
with
the
people
but
very
few
gave
him
that
chance
though
he
affected
to
be
exceedingly
gay
jocose
and
talkative
he
could
not
get
many
people
to
stop
and
hear
him
every
one
particularly
the
women
were
filled
with
disgust
at
his
impudence
seeing
himself
nearly
deserted
at
the
church
door
he
turned
his
steps
towards
the
parsonage
which
he
entered
whistling
when
he
beheld
me
he
laughed
and
said
oh
oh
our
dear
little
father
chiniquy
here
how
do
you
do
i
am
quite
unwell
i
answered
since
i
see
that
you
are
so
miserably
destroying
i
do
not
want
to
destroy
myself
he
answered
but
it
is
you
who
wants
to
turn
me
out
of
my
beautiful
parish
of
bourbonnais
to
take
my
place
with
the
four
blockheads
who
accompanied
you
the
other
day
you
have
frightened
and
persuaded
me
that
my
misfortune
with
mary
was
known
by
all
the
people
but
our
good
bishop
has
understood
that
this
was
a
trick
of
yours
and
that
it
was
one
of
your
lying
stories
i
came
back
to
take
possession
of
my
parish
and
turn
you
if
the
bishop
has
sent
you
back
here
to
turn
me
out
that
i
may
go
back
to
my
dear
colony
he
has
just
done
what
i
asked
him
to
do
for
he
knows
better
than
any
man
for
what
great
purpose
i
came
to
this
country
and
that
i
can
not
do
my
work
so
long
as
he
asks
me
to
take
care
of
bourbonnais
i
go
at
once
and
leave
you
in
full
possession
of
your
parsonage
but
i
pity
you
when
i
see
the
dark
cloud
which
is
on
your
horizon
you
are
the
only
dark
cloud
on
my
horizon
he
answered
when
you
are
gone
i
will
be
in
as
perfect
peace
as
i
was
before
you
set
your
feet
in
illinois
and
please
never
come
back
here
except
i
invite
i
left
and
ordered
my
to
drive
me
back
to
anne
but
when
crossing
the
village
i
saw
that
there
was
a
terrible
excitement
among
the
people
several
times
they
stopped
me
and
requested
me
to
remain
in
their
midst
to
advise
them
what
to
do
but
i
refused
saying
to
them
it
would
be
an
insult
on
my
part
to
advise
you
anything
in
a
matter
where
your
duty
as
men
and
catholics
is
so
clear
consult
the
respect
you
owe
to
yourselves
to
your
families
and
to
your
church
and
you
will
know
what
to
it
took
me
all
night
which
was
very
dark
to
come
back
to
anne
where
i
arrived
at
dawn
the
of
may
the
next
sabbath
day
i
held
a
public
service
in
my
chapel
which
was
crowded
without
making
any
allusion
to
that
deplorable
affair
on
the
monday
following
four
citizens
of
bourbonnais
were
deputed
to
tell
me
what
they
had
done
and
asked
me
not
to
desert
them
in
that
hour
of
trial
but
to
remember
that
i
was
their
countryman
and
that
they
had
nobody
else
to
whom
they
could
look
to
help
to
fulfill
their
religious
duties
here
is
the
substance
of
their
message
as
soon
as
we
saw
that
you
had
left
our
village
without
telling
us
what
to
do
we
called
a
public
meeting
where
we
passed
the
following
resolutions
no
personal
insult
shall
be
given
to
courjeault
we
can
not
consent
to
keep
him
a
single
hour
as
our
pastor
when
next
sabbath
he
will
begin
his
sermon
we
will
instantly
leave
the
church
and
go
to
the
door
that
he
may
remain
absolutely
alone
and
understand
our
stern
determination
not
to
have
him
any
more
for
our
spiritual
teacher
we
will
send
these
resolutions
to
the
bishop
and
ask
him
to
allow
chiniquy
to
divide
his
time
and
attention
between
his
new
colony
and
us
till
we
have
a
pastor
able
to
instruct
and
edify
us
strange
to
say
poor
courjeault
shut
up
in
his
parsonage
during
that
night
knew
nothing
of
that
meeting
he
had
not
found
a
single
friend
to
warn
him
of
what
was
to
happen
the
next
sunday
that
sunday
the
weather
was
magnificent
and
there
never
had
been
such
a
multitude
of
people
at
the
church
the
miserable
priest
thinking
by
that
unusual
crowd
that
everything
was
to
be
right
with
him
that
day
began
his
mass
and
went
to
the
pulpit
to
deliver
his
sermon
but
he
had
hardly
pronounced
the
first
words
when
at
a
signal
given
by
some
one
the
whole
people
without
a
single
exception
ran
out
of
the
church
as
if
it
had
been
on
fire
and
he
remained
alone
of
course
this
fell
upon
him
as
a
thunderbolt
and
he
came
very
near
fainting
however
recovering
himself
he
went
to
the
door
and
having
with
his
tears
and
sobs
as
with
his
words
persuaded
the
people
to
listen
to
what
he
had
to
tell
them
he
said
i
see
that
the
hand
of
god
is
upon
me
and
i
deserve
it
i
have
sinned
and
made
a
mistake
by
coming
back
you
do
not
want
me
any
more
to
be
your
pastor
i
can
not
complain
of
that
this
is
your
right
you
will
be
satisfied
i
will
leave
the
place
forever
i
only
ask
you
to
forgive
my
past
errors
and
pray
for
this
short
address
was
followed
by
the
most
deadly
silence
not
a
voice
was
heard
to
insult
him
many
on
the
contrary
were
so
much
impressed
with
the
sad
solemnity
of
this
occurrence
that
they
could
not
refrain
their
tears
the
whole
people
went
back
to
their
homes
with
broken
hearts
courjeault
left
bourbonnais
that
very
night
never
to
return
again
but
the
awful
scandal
he
had
given
did
not
disappear
with
him
our
great
and
merciful
god
who
many
times
has
made
the
very
sins
and
errors
of
his
people
to
work
for
good
caused
that
public
iniquity
of
the
priest
to
remove
the
scales
from
many
eyes
and
prepare
them
to
receive
the
light
which
was
already
dawning
at
the
horizon
a
voice
from
heaven
was
as
if
heard
by
many
of
us
do
you
not
see
that
in
your
church
of
rome
you
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
the
lying
traditions
of
men
is
it
not
evident
that
your
priest
s
celibacy
is
a
snare
and
an
institution
of
satan
many
asked
me
to
show
them
in
the
gospel
where
christ
had
established
the
law
of
celibacy
i
will
do
better
i
added
i
will
put
the
gospel
in
your
hands
and
you
will
look
for
yourselves
in
that
holy
book
what
is
said
on
that
the
very
same
day
i
ordered
a
merchant
from
montreal
to
send
me
a
large
box
filled
with
new
testaments
printed
by
the
order
of
the
archbishop
of
quebec
and
on
the
as
many
from
new
york
very
soon
it
was
known
by
every
one
of
my
emigrants
that
not
only
had
jesus
never
forbidden
his
apostles
and
priests
to
marry
but
he
had
left
them
free
to
have
their
wives
and
live
with
them
according
to
the
very
testimony
of
paul
have
we
not
the
power
to
lead
about
with
us
a
wife
and
sister
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
apostles
and
brethren
of
the
lord
and
cephas
cor
ix
they
saw
by
their
gospel
that
the
doctrine
of
celibacy
of
the
priests
was
not
brought
from
heaven
by
christ
but
had
been
forged
in
darkness
to
add
to
the
miseries
of
man
they
read
and
read
over
again
these
words
of
christ
if
you
continue
in
my
word
you
shall
be
my
disciples
indeed
you
shall
know
the
truth
and
it
shall
make
you
free
if
therefore
the
son
shall
make
you
free
you
shall
be
free
indeed
john
viii
and
those
promises
of
liberty
which
christ
gave
to
those
who
read
and
followed
his
word
made
their
hearts
leap
with
joy
they
fell
upon
their
minds
as
music
from
heaven
they
also
soon
found
by
themselves
that
every
time
the
disciples
of
christ
had
asked
him
who
would
be
the
first
ruler
or
the
pope
in
his
church
he
had
always
solemnly
and
positively
said
that
in
his
church
nobody
would
ever
become
the
first
the
ruler
or
the
pope
and
they
began
seriously
to
suspect
that
the
great
powers
of
the
pope
and
his
bishops
were
nothing
but
a
sacrilegious
usurpation
i
was
not
long
without
seeing
that
the
reading
of
the
holy
scriptures
by
my
dear
countrymen
was
changing
them
into
other
men
their
minds
were
evidently
enlarged
and
raised
to
higher
spheres
of
thought
they
were
beginning
to
suspect
that
the
heavy
chains
which
were
wounding
their
shoulders
were
preventing
them
from
making
progress
in
wealth
intelligence
and
liberty
as
their
more
fortunate
called
protestants
this
was
not
yet
the
bright
light
of
the
day
but
it
was
the
blessed
dawn
chapter
lii
on
the
of
may
i
received
the
following
letter
from
bishop
vandeveld
rev
chiniquy
my
dear
chiniquy
rev
courjeault
is
just
returned
from
bourbonnais
where
he
ought
never
to
have
gone
back
he
has
told
me
of
his
complete
failure
and
ignominious
exit
i
bitterly
regret
having
allowed
him
to
go
there
again
but
he
had
so
persuaded
me
that
his
criminal
conduct
with
his
servant
girl
was
ignored
by
the
people
that
i
had
yielded
to
his
request
i
feel
that
this
new
attempt
on
his
part
to
impose
himself
on
that
honest
people
has
added
to
the
enormity
of
his
first
scandal
i
advise
him
now
to
go
back
to
france
where
he
can
more
easily
conceal
his
shame
than
in
america
but
one
of
the
darkest
features
of
that
disgusting
affair
is
that
i
am
obliged
to
pay
the
which
the
girl
asked
in
order
to
prevent
mr
courjeault
from
being
dragged
before
the
civil
tribunal
and
sent
to
jail
the
malice
of
that
priest
against
you
has
received
its
just
reward
but
my
fear
is
that
you
have
another
implacable
enemy
here
in
lebel
whose
power
to
do
evil
is
greater
than
courjeault
s
before
you
began
your
great
work
of
directing
the
flood
of
roman
catholic
emigration
towards
this
country
to
secure
it
to
our
holy
church
he
was
in
favor
of
that
glorious
scheme
but
his
jealousy
against
you
has
suddenly
changed
his
mind
he
has
lately
addressed
a
letter
to
the
canadian
press
every
word
of
which
is
an
unmitigated
falsehood
of
course
the
bishop
of
montreal
who
is
more
than
ever
opposed
to
our
colonization
plan
has
published
that
lying
letter
in
his
journal
more
than
that
he
has
reproduced
the
testimony
of
a
perjured
man
who
swears
that
many
of
the
people
of
illinois
are
bitten
and
killed
by
the
rattlesnakes
and
those
who
escape
are
taxed
six
cents
for
each
pane
of
glass
of
their
windows
will
you
be
discouraged
by
this
opposition
i
hope
not
this
opposition
is
the
greatest
evidence
we
could
have
that
our
scheme
is
from
god
and
that
he
will
support
you
i
am
tempted
to
interdict
lebel
and
send
him
back
to
canada
for
writing
things
which
he
so
well
knows
to
be
false
the
want
of
a
priest
for
your
countrymen
of
chicago
is
the
only
thing
which
has
prevented
me
from
withdrawing
his
faculties
but
i
have
warned
him
that
if
he
writes
any
more
against
the
truth
i
will
punish
him
as
he
deserves
for
you
my
dear
sir
i
will
address
to
you
the
very
words
which
god
himself
addressed
to
his
servant
joshua
be
strong
and
of
good
courage
for
unto
this
people
shalt
thou
divide
for
an
inheritance
the
land
which
i
swear
unto
their
fathers
to
give
them
joshua
agree
with
what
you
wrote
me
in
your
last
letter
that
the
charge
i
have
given
you
of
bourbonnais
pro
tempore
will
seriously
interfere
with
your
other
numberless
duties
towards
your
dear
emigrants
but
there
is
no
help
the
only
thing
i
can
promise
is
to
relieve
you
as
soon
as
possible
i
have
no
other
priest
to
whom
i
can
trust
the
interesting
mission
of
bourbonnais
for
father
huick
is
too
old
and
infirm
for
such
a
work
it
is
evidently
the
will
of
god
that
you
should
extend
your
labors
over
the
first
limits
you
had
fixed
be
faithful
to
the
end
and
the
lord
will
be
with
you
and
support
you
throughout
all
your
labors
and
tribulations
truly
yours
oliv
vandeveld
of
during
the
next
six
months
more
than
families
from
france
belgium
and
canada
came
and
gave
to
our
colony
a
life
power
and
prosperity
impossible
for
me
to
depict
the
joy
i
felt
at
this
unforeseen
success
was
much
diminished
however
by
the
sudden
news
that
courjeault
had
come
back
from
france
where
he
spent
only
one
month
not
daring
to
visit
bourbonnais
again
he
was
lurking
on
the
frontiers
of
indiana
only
a
few
miles
distant
evidently
with
some
sinister
intention
driven
to
a
state
of
madness
by
his
jealousy
and
hatred
that
unfortunate
man
addressed
to
me
on
the
of
january
the
most
abusive
letter
i
ever
received
and
ended
it
by
telling
me
that
the
fine
though
unfinished
church
of
bourbonnais
which
he
had
built
was
to
be
burned
and
that
my
life
would
be
in
danger
if
i
remained
at
the
head
of
that
mission
i
immediately
sent
that
letter
to
the
bishop
asking
his
advice
in
his
answer
he
told
me
that
he
thought
that
courjeault
was
wicked
enough
to
fulfill
his
threats
he
added
though
i
have
not
yet
clear
evidence
of
it
it
is
my
fear
that
lebel
is
united
with
courjeault
in
the
diabolical
plot
of
burning
your
church
of
bourbonnais
several
people
have
reported
to
me
that
he
says
that
your
presence
there
will
be
the
ruin
of
that
people
and
the
destruction
of
their
church
oh
to
what
extremities
bad
priests
can
go
when
once
they
have
given
themselves
to
their
unbridled
passions
the
first
thing
i
would
advise
you
my
dear
chiniquy
in
the
presence
of
such
a
terrible
calamity
is
to
insure
that
church
without
delay
i
have
tried
to
do
it
here
but
they
have
refused
under
the
pretext
that
it
is
an
unfinished
frame
building
and
there
are
too
many
dangers
of
fire
when
people
are
still
working
at
it
my
impression
is
that
lebel
is
on
intimate
terms
with
some
insurance
gentlemen
and
has
frightened
them
by
speaking
of
that
rumor
of
danger
of
which
he
is
probably
the
father
with
that
miserable
courjeault
perhaps
you
may
have
a
better
chance
by
addressing
yourself
to
some
insurance
company
which
you
might
find
at
joliet
or
at
after
vain
efforts
to
insure
the
church
i
wrote
to
the
bishop
the
only
way
to
escape
the
impending
danger
is
to
finish
the
church
at
once
and
insure
it
after
i
have
just
made
a
collection
of
among
the
people
of
bourbonnais
to
which
i
added
from
my
own
private
resources
and
will
go
to
work
immediately
if
your
lordship
has
no
having
got
the
approbation
of
my
superior
on
the
of
march
i
began
to
put
the
last
hand
to
that
building
we
worked
almost
day
and
night
till
the
of
may
when
it
was
all
finished
i
dare
affirm
that
for
a
country
place
that
church
was
unsurpassed
in
beauty
the
inside
was
all
made
of
the
splendid
black
oak
of
bourbonnais
polished
and
varnished
by
most
skillful
men
and
it
looked
like
a
mirror
very
seldom
have
i
seen
anything
more
grand
and
beautiful
than
the
altar
made
also
of
that
precious
black
oak
it
was
late
at
night
when
with
my
covered
with
dust
and
sweat
we
could
say
with
joy
the
solemn
words
it
is
finished
afterwards
we
sung
the
te
deum
had
i
had
any
opportunity
at
that
late
hour
it
was
my
thought
and
desire
to
insure
it
but
i
was
forced
to
postpone
this
till
the
next
monday
the
next
day
the
first
sabbath
of
may
the
sun
seemed
to
come
out
from
the
horizon
and
rise
above
our
heads
with
more
than
usual
magnificence
the
air
was
calm
and
pure
and
the
numberless
spring
flowers
of
our
gardens
mingling
their
perfumes
with
the
fragrant
leaves
of
the
splendid
forest
at
the
front
of
the
village
the
balmy
atmosphere
the
songs
of
the
birds
seemed
to
tell
us
that
this
sabbath
day
was
to
be
the
most
happy
one
for
me
and
my
dear
people
of
bourbonnais
the
church
had
never
been
so
crowded
the
hymns
we
sung
had
never
been
so
melodious
and
the
words
of
gratitude
which
i
addressed
to
my
god
when
i
thanked
him
for
the
church
he
had
given
us
in
which
to
adore
and
bless
him
had
never
been
so
sincere
and
earnest
never
had
our
tears
of
joy
flowed
so
profusely
as
on
that
splendid
and
sabbath
alas
who
would
suspect
that
six
hours
later
the
same
people
gathered
around
the
smoking
ruins
of
their
church
would
rend
the
air
with
their
cries
of
desolation
such
however
was
the
case
while
taking
my
dinner
after
the
public
service
two
little
boys
who
had
remained
in
the
church
to
wait
for
the
hour
of
the
catechism
ran
to
the
parsonage
crying
fire
fire
fire
and
with
the
idea
that
my
church
was
on
fire
i
went
out
to
see
the
awful
reality
a
girdle
of
smoke
and
fire
was
already
issuing
from
almost
every
part
between
the
top
of
the
wooden
walls
and
the
roof
i
had
rushed
to
the
church
with
a
pail
of
water
in
my
hand
but
it
was
too
late
to
make
any
use
of
it
the
flames
were
already
running
and
leaping
with
a
fearful
rapidity
over
the
fresh
varnish
like
a
long
train
of
powder
in
less
than
two
hours
all
was
finished
again
no
doubt
could
remain
in
our
minds
this
was
the
work
of
an
incendiary
for
there
was
no
fire
in
the
church
after
the
service
many
strangers
who
had
come
from
a
distance
had
gone
through
the
whole
nave
and
the
upper
galleries
to
have
a
better
sight
of
the
whole
building
and
two
of
them
had
been
seen
by
the
little
boys
remaining
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
alone
they
had
gone
back
to
some
of
the
houses
of
the
village
without
being
remarked
by
anybody
for
it
was
dinner
time
and
there
was
nobody
to
watch
them
though
stunned
by
that
awful
calamity
the
people
of
bourbonnais
did
not
lose
their
minds
seeing
that
they
were
all
gathered
around
the
smoking
ruins
at
about
six
i
addressed
to
them
a
few
words
to
support
their
courage
i
told
them
that
it
was
only
in
the
midst
of
great
trials
and
difficulties
that
men
could
show
their
noblest
qualities
and
their
true
manhood
that
if
we
were
true
men
instead
of
losing
our
time
in
shedding
tears
and
rending
the
air
with
our
cries
of
desolation
we
would
immediately
put
our
hands
to
the
work
and
begin
the
very
next
day
to
raise
up
not
a
frame
building
which
the
flames
could
turn
into
ashes
in
a
few
minutes
and
which
the
storm
could
blow
down
over
our
heads
but
a
stone
church
which
would
stand
before
god
and
man
as
an
imperishable
monument
of
their
faith
indomitable
courage
and
liberality
we
immediately
started
a
subscription
to
erect
without
delay
a
stone
church
in
less
than
one
hour
in
money
and
more
than
in
time
timber
and
stone
and
other
material
were
subscribed
every
cent
of
which
has
been
faithfully
given
for
the
erection
of
that
fine
stone
church
of
bourbonnais
the
next
thursday
bishop
vandeveld
came
from
chicago
to
confer
with
me
about
what
could
be
done
to
repair
that
terrible
loss
and
to
inquire
confidentially
of
me
as
to
the
author
of
that
fire
all
the
facts
we
gathered
pointed
to
the
same
direction
it
was
evident
that
the
miserable
courjeault
with
lebel
the
french
canadian
priest
of
chicago
had
done
that
evil
work
through
their
emissaries
no
doubt
of
this
remained
in
my
mind
when
i
learned
that
soon
after
courjeault
had
thrown
himself
into
one
of
those
dark
dungeons
called
a
monastery
of
la
trappe
which
satan
has
built
on
earth
as
a
preparation
for
the
dark
hereafter
of
the
wicked
the
unexpected
visit
of
the
bishop
had
at
first
rejoiced
me
by
the
hope
that
he
would
bring
me
words
of
encouragement
but
what
was
my
disappointment
when
he
said
to
me
my
dear
chiniquy
i
must
reveal
to
you
a
thing
that
i
have
not
yet
made
known
to
anyone
it
is
confidential
and
i
request
you
not
to
say
a
word
before
it
is
accomplished
i
can
not
remain
any
longer
bishop
of
illinois
no
i
can
not
any
longer
assume
the
responsibilities
of
such
a
high
position
because
it
is
beyond
my
power
to
fulfill
my
duties
and
do
what
the
church
requires
of
me
the
conduct
of
the
priests
of
this
diocese
is
such
that
should
i
follow
the
regulations
of
the
canon
i
would
be
forced
to
interdict
all
my
priests
with
the
exception
of
you
and
two
or
three
others
they
are
all
either
notorious
drunkards
or
given
to
public
or
secret
concubinage
several
of
them
have
children
by
their
own
nieces
and
two
by
their
own
sisters
i
do
not
think
that
ten
of
them
believe
in
god
religion
is
nothing
to
them
but
a
comedy
where
can
i
find
a
remedy
for
such
a
general
evil
can
i
punish
one
of
them
and
leave
the
others
free
in
their
abominable
doings
when
they
are
almost
all
equally
guilty
would
not
the
general
interdiction
of
these
priests
be
the
death
blow
to
our
church
in
illinois
besides
how
can
i
punish
them
when
i
know
that
many
of
them
are
ready
to
poison
me
the
very
moment
i
raise
a
finger
against
them
i
suppose
that
you
do
not
ignore
the
fact
that
my
poor
predecessor
was
poisoned
by
one
of
those
priests
who
had
seduced
several
nuns
when
he
was
in
the
very
act
of
investigating
the
matter
i
intend
to
go
to
rome
as
soon
as
i
receive
my
permit
from
the
pope
to
renounce
at
his
feet
the
bishopric
of
chicago
which
i
will
not
keep
on
any
consideration
if
the
pope
does
not
give
me
another
diocese
with
a
better
set
of
priests
i
prefer
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
at
the
head
of
a
small
congregation
where
i
shall
not
have
on
my
shoulders
the
awful
responsibility
which
is
killing
me
here
the
last
horrible
deeds
of
courjeault
and
lebel
of
which
you
are
the
victim
has
filled
the
bitter
cup
which
god
has
put
to
my
lips
to
drink
it
is
overflowing
i
can
not
any
longer
endure
when
speaking
so
the
bishop
s
face
was
bathed
with
tears
it
was
very
late
indeed
to
make
the
remonstrances
which
came
to
my
mind
in
order
to
change
his
resolutions
i
determined
to
wait
till
the
next
morning
when
i
should
have
plenty
of
time
i
hoped
to
expel
his
dark
thoughts
and
give
him
more
courage
besides
i
was
myself
so
discouraged
by
those
awful
disclosures
that
i
was
in
need
of
mental
as
well
as
bodily
rest
but
alas
the
next
day
was
to
be
one
of
the
darkest
of
my
priestly
life
when
the
hour
for
breakfast
came
the
next
morning
i
went
to
awaken
the
bishop
what
was
my
dismay
when
i
found
him
drunk
before
going
to
bed
he
had
secretly
asked
my
housekeeper
to
give
him
the
bottle
of
wine
which
i
used
to
celebrate
mass
it
was
a
large
bottle
containing
nearly
a
quart
of
wine
which
would
last
me
at
least
six
months
the
whole
of
which
he
had
drank
during
the
night
i
had
been
told
that
bishop
vandeveld
as
well
as
the
greater
number
of
the
bishops
of
the
united
states
was
a
drunkard
but
i
had
never
believed
it
he
always
drank
very
moderately
before
me
any
time
i
sat
at
his
table
or
he
at
mine
it
appears
that
it
was
at
night
when
nobody
could
see
him
that
he
gave
himself
up
to
that
detestable
habit
his
room
was
filled
with
the
odor
of
what
he
had
vomited
after
drinking
such
an
enormous
quantity
of
wine
he
left
the
room
only
at
noon
after
the
fumes
of
the
wine
had
almost
entirely
disappeared
and
requested
the
housekeeper
to
cleanse
it
herself
without
letting
the
servants
know
anything
of
the
occurrence
of
the
night
but
words
would
fail
to
express
my
consternation
and
the
discouragement
i
felt
i
had
formed
such
a
good
and
exalted
opinion
of
that
man
i
had
found
in
him
such
noble
qualities
his
intelligence
was
so
bright
his
learning
so
extensive
his
heart
so
large
his
plans
so
grand
his
piety
so
sincere
his
charity
so
worthy
of
a
bishop
of
christ
it
was
so
pleasant
for
me
to
know
till
then
that
i
was
honored
with
the
full
confidence
of
a
bishop
who
it
seemed
to
me
had
not
a
superior
in
our
church
the
destruction
of
my
dear
church
by
the
hands
of
incendiaries
was
surely
a
great
calamity
for
me
but
the
fall
of
my
bishop
from
the
high
position
he
had
in
my
heart
and
mind
was
still
greater
i
had
the
means
in
hand
to
rebuild
that
church
but
my
confidence
in
my
bishop
was
irremediably
and
forever
lost
never
had
a
son
loved
his
father
more
sincerely
than
i
had
loved
him
and
never
had
any
priest
felt
a
more
sincere
respect
for
his
bishop
than
i
for
him
oh
what
a
terrible
wound
was
made
in
my
heart
that
day
what
tortures
i
felt
but
how
many
times
since
i
have
blessed
my
god
for
these
wounds
without
them
i
should
never
have
known
that
instead
of
being
in
the
bosom
of
the
immaculate
church
of
christ
i
was
the
slave
of
that
great
babylon
which
poisons
the
nations
with
the
wine
of
her
abominations
my
love
and
respect
for
bishop
vandeveld
were
very
strong
chains
by
which
i
was
bound
to
the
feet
of
the
idols
of
rome
i
will
earnestly
bless
god
for
having
himself
broken
these
chains
on
that
day
of
supreme
desolation
the
remaining
part
of
the
day
as
well
as
the
hour
of
the
next
morning
which
the
bishop
spent
in
my
house
i
remained
almost
mute
in
his
presence
he
was
not
less
embarrassed
when
he
asked
me
my
view
about
his
project
of
leaving
the
diocese
i
answered
him
in
a
few
words
that
i
could
not
disapprove
the
purpose
for
i
would
myself
prefer
to
live
in
a
dark
forest
in
the
midst
of
wild
animals
than
among
drunken
atheist
priests
and
bishops
some
months
later
i
learned
without
regret
that
the
pope
had
accepted
his
resignation
of
the
bishopric
of
chicago
and
appointed
him
bishop
of
natchez
in
louisiana
his
successor
to
the
bishopric
of
chicago
was
rev
o
regan
one
of
the
very
first
things
which
this
new
bishop
did
was
to
bring
bishop
vandeveld
before
the
criminal
tribunals
as
a
thief
accusing
him
of
having
stolen
from
the
bishopric
of
chicago
and
carrying
them
away
with
him
there
is
no
need
to
say
that
this
action
caused
a
terrible
scandal
not
only
in
illinois
but
through
all
the
united
states
both
priests
and
laymen
had
to
blush
and
cast
down
their
eyes
before
the
world
the
two
bishops
employing
the
best
lawyers
to
fight
each
other
came
very
near
proving
to
the
world
that
both
of
them
were
equally
swindlers
and
thieves
when
the
pope
forced
them
both
to
stop
their
contestation
and
bring
the
affair
before
his
tribunal
at
rome
there
it
was
decided
that
the
which
had
really
been
taken
from
chicago
to
the
natchez
diocese
should
be
equally
divided
between
the
two
bishops
how
many
times
did
i
feel
my
soul
brought
to
the
dust
in
the
midst
of
those
horrible
scandals
how
many
sleepless
nights
have
i
spent
when
a
voice
which
i
could
not
silence
seemed
crying
to
me
louder
than
thunder
what
are
you
doing
here
extending
the
power
of
a
church
which
is
a
den
of
thieves
drunkards
and
impure
atheists
a
church
governed
by
men
whom
you
know
to
be
godless
swindlers
and
vile
comedians
do
you
not
see
that
you
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
the
lying
traditions
of
men
when
you
consent
to
bow
your
knees
before
such
men
is
it
not
blasphemy
to
call
such
men
the
ambassadors
and
the
disciples
of
the
humble
pure
holy
peaceful
and
divine
jesus
come
out
of
that
church
break
the
fetters
by
which
you
are
bound
as
a
vile
slave
to
the
feet
of
such
men
take
the
gospel
for
thine
only
guide
and
christ
for
thine
only
ruler
i
was
in
desolation
at
finding
that
my
faith
in
my
church
was
in
spite
of
myself
shaken
by
these
scandals
with
burning
tears
rolling
down
my
cheeks
and
with
a
broken
and
humiliated
heart
i
fell
one
night
on
my
knees
and
asked
my
god
to
have
mercy
upon
me
by
strengthening
my
faith
and
preserving
it
from
ruin
but
it
seemed
that
neither
my
tears
nor
my
cries
were
of
any
avail
and
i
remained
the
whole
night
as
a
ship
struck
by
a
hurricane
drifting
on
an
unknown
sea
without
a
compass
or
a
rudder
i
was
not
aware
of
it
then
but
i
learned
it
after
that
the
divine
and
sure
pilot
was
directing
my
course
towards
the
port
of
salvation
the
next
day
i
had
a
happy
diversion
in
the
arrival
of
fifty
new
emigrants
who
knocked
at
my
door
asking
my
advice
about
the
best
place
to
select
for
their
future
home
it
seemed
to
me
though
pretty
long
after
that
that
my
duty
was
to
go
and
pay
my
respects
to
my
new
bishop
and
open
to
him
my
heart
as
to
my
best
friend
and
the
guide
whom
god
himself
had
chosen
to
heal
the
wounds
of
my
soul
by
pouring
the
oil
and
wine
of
charity
into
them
i
will
never
forget
the
day
the
day
of
december
when
i
saw
bishop
o
regan
for
the
first
time
nor
the
painful
impressions
i
received
from
that
first
interview
he
was
of
medium
stature
with
a
repugnant
face
and
his
head
always
in
motion
all
its
motions
seemed
the
expression
of
insolence
contempt
tyranny
and
pride
there
was
absolutely
nothing
pleasant
either
in
his
words
or
in
his
manners
i
fell
on
my
knees
to
ask
his
benediction
when
i
had
given
him
my
name
and
kissed
his
hand
which
seemed
as
cold
as
that
of
a
corpse
ah
ah
you
are
father
chiniquy
he
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
though
you
have
deferred
your
visit
a
long
time
please
sit
down
i
want
some
explanation
from
you
about
a
certain
very
strange
document
which
i
have
just
read
and
he
went
at
the
double
quick
to
his
room
to
get
the
document
there
were
two
irish
priests
in
the
room
who
came
a
few
minutes
before
me
when
we
were
alone
one
of
them
said
we
had
hoped
that
we
would
gain
by
changing
bishop
vandeveld
for
this
one
but
my
fear
is
that
we
have
only
passed
from
charybdis
to
scylla
and
they
laughed
outright
but
i
could
not
laugh
i
was
more
inclined
to
weep
after
less
than
ten
minutes
of
absence
the
bishop
returned
holding
in
his
hand
a
paper
which
i
understood
at
once
to
be
the
deed
of
the
eleven
acres
of
land
which
i
had
bought
and
on
which
i
had
built
my
chapel
of
anne
do
you
known
this
paper
he
asked
me
in
an
angry
manner
yes
my
lord
i
know
it
i
answered
but
then
he
quickly
replied
you
must
know
that
that
title
is
a
nullity
a
fraud
which
you
ought
never
to
have
your
venerable
and
worthy
predecessor
has
accepted
it
i
answered
and
what
might
have
been
incorrect
has
been
made
valid
i
hope
by
his
i
do
not
care
a
straw
about
what
my
predecessor
has
done
he
abruptly
answered
he
is
not
here
to
defend
himself
neither
are
we
here
to
discuss
his
merits
or
demerits
we
have
not
to
deal
with
my
lord
vandeveld
but
with
a
document
which
is
a
nullity
a
deception
which
must
be
thrown
into
the
fire
you
must
give
me
another
title
of
that
property
and
saying
this
he
flung
my
deed
on
the
floor
i
calmly
picked
it
up
and
said
i
exceedingly
regret
my
lord
that
my
first
interview
with
your
lordship
should
be
the
occasion
of
such
an
unexpected
act
but
i
hope
this
will
not
destroy
the
paternal
sentiments
which
god
must
have
put
into
the
heart
of
my
bishop
for
the
last
and
least
of
his
priests
i
see
that
your
lordship
is
very
busy
i
do
not
want
to
trespass
on
your
valuable
time
i
take
this
rejected
document
with
me
to
make
another
one
which
i
hope
will
be
more
agreeable
to
your
views
and
i
then
took
my
departure
i
leave
the
reader
to
imagine
the
sentiments
which
filled
my
mind
when
coming
back
to
my
colony
i
did
not
dare
to
say
a
word
to
my
people
about
our
bishop
when
questioned
by
them
i
gave
the
most
evasive
answers
i
could
but
i
felt
as
the
mariner
feels
when
he
hears
the
rumbling
thunder
approaching
though
the
sea
is
calm
as
the
oil
of
a
lamp
he
knows
the
storm
is
coming
he
trims
his
sails
and
prepares
for
the
impending
hurricane
it
seemed
that
my
most
pressing
duty
after
my
first
interview
was
to
bring
my
heart
nearer
to
my
god
than
ever
to
read
and
study
my
bible
with
more
attention
and
to
get
my
people
to
take
more
than
ever
the
word
of
god
as
their
daily
bread
i
began
also
to
speak
more
openly
of
our
christian
rights
as
well
as
of
our
duties
as
these
are
set
forth
in
the
gospel
of
christ
some
time
before
this
feeling
more
than
ever
that
i
could
not
do
justice
to
my
colony
by
keeping
any
longer
the
charge
of
bourbonnais
i
had
respectfully
sent
my
resignation
to
the
bishop
which
had
been
accepted
a
priest
had
been
called
by
him
to
take
my
place
there
but
he
too
was
ere
long
guilty
of
a
public
scandal
with
his
servant
girl
the
principal
citizens
of
bourbonnais
protested
against
his
presence
in
their
midst
and
soon
forced
the
bishop
to
dismiss
him
his
successor
was
the
miserable
priest
lebel
who
had
been
turned
out
of
chicago
for
a
criminal
offence
with
his
own
niece
and
was
now
to
be
the
curate
of
bourbonnais
but
his
drunkenness
and
other
public
vices
caused
him
to
be
interdicted
and
expelled
from
that
place
in
the
month
of
september
about
the
same
time
a
priest
who
had
been
expelled
from
belgium
for
a
great
scandal
was
sent
to
kankakee
as
the
curate
of
the
french
canadians
of
that
interesting
young
city
after
his
expulsion
from
belgium
he
had
come
to
chicago
where
under
another
name
he
had
made
a
fortune
and
for
five
or
six
years
kept
a
house
of
prostitution
becoming
tired
of
that
occupation
he
offered
to
the
bishop
if
he
would
accept
him
as
one
of
his
priests
and
give
him
a
parish
bishop
o
regan
being
in
need
of
money
accepted
the
gift
and
fulfilled
the
condition
by
sending
him
as
missionary
to
kankakee
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
possession
of
that
interesting
mission
he
came
with
lebel
to
pay
me
a
visit
i
received
them
as
politely
as
possible
though
they
were
both
half
drunk
when
they
arrived
after
dinner
they
went
to
shoot
prairie
chickens
and
got
so
drunk
that
one
of
them
lebel
lost
his
boots
in
a
slough
and
came
back
to
my
house
barefooted
without
noticing
his
loss
i
had
to
help
them
get
their
carriage
and
the
next
day
i
wrote
them
forbidding
them
to
ever
set
a
foot
in
my
house
again
but
what
was
my
surprise
and
sadness
not
long
before
these
two
infamous
priests
were
ignominiously
turned
out
by
their
people
to
receive
a
letter
from
my
bishop
which
ended
in
these
words
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
refuse
to
live
on
good
terms
with
your
two
neighboring
brother
priests
this
ought
not
to
be
and
i
hope
to
hear
soon
that
you
have
reconciled
yourself
with
them
in
a
friendly
way
as
you
ought
to
have
done
long
i
answered
him
it
is
my
interest
as
well
as
my
duty
to
obey
my
bishop
i
know
it
but
as
long
as
my
bishop
gives
me
for
neighbors
priests
one
of
whom
has
lived
publicly
with
his
own
niece
as
his
wife
and
the
other
who
has
kept
a
house
of
prostitution
in
chicago
i
respectfully
ask
my
bishop
to
be
excused
for
not
visiting
the
bishop
felt
insulted
by
my
letter
and
was
furious
against
me
it
came
to
be
a
public
fact
that
he
had
said
before
many
people
i
would
give
anything
to
the
one
who
would
help
me
to
get
rid
of
that
unmanageable
among
those
who
heard
the
bishop
was
a
land
speculator
a
real
against
whom
a
bill
for
perjury
had
been
found
by
the
jury
of
iroquois
county
the
of
april
that
man
was
very
angry
against
me
for
protecting
my
poor
countrymen
against
his
too
sharp
speculations
he
said
to
the
bishop
if
you
pay
the
expenses
of
the
suit
i
pledge
myself
to
have
chiniquy
put
in
the
bishop
had
publicly
answered
him
no
sum
of
money
will
be
too
great
to
be
delivered
from
a
priest
who
alone
gives
me
more
trouble
than
the
rest
of
my
to
comply
with
the
desires
of
the
bishop
this
speculator
dragged
me
before
the
criminal
court
of
kankakee
on
the
day
of
may
but
he
lost
his
action
and
was
condemned
to
pay
the
cost
it
was
my
impression
that
the
bishop
having
so
often
expressed
in
public
his
bad
feelings
against
me
would
not
visit
my
colony
but
i
was
mistaken
on
the
of
june
taking
the
rev
lebel
and
carthuval
for
his
companions
he
came
to
anne
to
administer
the
sacrament
of
confirmation
as
the
infamous
conduct
of
those
two
priests
was
known
to
every
one
of
my
people
i
felt
a
supreme
disgust
at
their
arrival
and
came
very
near
forbidding
them
to
sit
at
my
table
having
however
asked
the
bishop
to
give
me
of
private
interview
i
respectfully
but
energetically
protested
against
the
presence
of
these
two
degraded
men
in
my
house
he
coldly
answered
me
mr
chiniquy
you
forget
that
i
am
the
bishop
of
illinois
and
that
you
are
a
simple
priest
whom
i
can
interdict
and
remove
from
here
when
i
like
i
do
not
come
here
to
receive
your
lessons
but
to
intimate
to
you
my
orders
you
seem
to
forget
that
charity
is
above
all
others
the
virtue
which
must
adorn
the
soul
of
a
good
priest
your
great
zeal
is
nothing
before
god
and
it
is
less
than
nothing
before
me
so
long
as
you
have
not
charity
it
is
my
business
and
not
yours
to
know
what
priests
i
must
employ
or
reject
your
business
is
to
respect
them
and
forget
their
past
errors
the
very
day
i
see
fit
to
receive
them
among
my
my
lord
i
answered
allow
me
respectfully
to
tell
you
that
though
you
are
a
bishop
and
i
am
a
simple
priest
the
gospel
of
christ
which
we
have
to
preach
tells
us
to
avoid
the
company
of
publicly
vicious
and
profligate
men
my
conscience
tells
me
that
through
respect
for
myself
and
my
people
and
through
respect
for
the
gospel
i
preach
i
must
avoid
the
company
of
men
one
of
whom
has
lived
with
his
niece
as
his
wife
and
the
other
has
till
very
lately
been
guilty
of
keeping
a
house
of
prostitution
in
chicago
your
lordship
may
ignore
these
things
and
in
consequence
of
that
may
give
his
confidence
to
these
men
but
nothing
is
more
apt
to
destroy
the
faith
of
our
french
canadian
people
than
to
see
such
men
in
your
company
when
you
come
to
administer
the
sacrament
of
confirmation
it
is
through
respect
for
your
lordship
that
i
take
the
liberty
of
speaking
he
angrily
answered
me
i
see
now
the
truthfulness
of
what
people
say
about
you
it
is
to
the
gospel
you
constantly
appeal
on
everything
the
gospel
the
gospel
is
surely
a
holy
book
but
remember
that
it
is
the
which
must
guide
you
christ
has
said
hear
my
i
am
here
the
interpreter
representative
of
the
you
disobey
me
it
is
the
church
you
now
my
lord
that
i
have
fulfilled
what
i
consider
a
conscientious
duty
i
promise
that
through
respect
for
your
lordship
and
to
keep
myself
in
the
bonds
of
peace
with
my
bishop
i
will
deal
with
these
two
priests
as
if
they
were
worthy
of
the
honorable
position
you
give
all
right
all
right
replied
the
bishop
but
it
must
be
near
the
hour
for
yes
my
lord
i
have
just
heard
the
bell
calling
us
to
the
after
the
blessing
of
the
table
by
the
bishop
he
looked
at
the
rev
carthuval
who
was
sitting
just
before
him
and
said
what
is
the
matter
with
you
carthuval
you
do
not
look
well
no
my
lord
he
answered
i
am
not
well
i
want
to
go
to
he
was
correct
he
was
not
well
for
he
was
drunk
during
the
public
services
he
had
left
the
chapel
to
come
down
to
ask
for
a
bottle
of
the
wine
i
kept
to
celebrate
mass
the
housekeeper
thinking
he
wanted
the
wine
in
the
chapel
handed
him
the
bottle
which
he
drank
in
her
presence
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
which
he
went
up
the
chapel
to
help
the
bishop
in
administering
the
confirmation
to
the
people
whom
i
had
prepared
for
the
reception
of
that
rite
as
soon
as
dinner
was
finished
the
bishop
requested
me
to
go
and
take
a
walk
with
him
after
giving
me
some
compliments
on
the
beauty
of
the
site
i
had
chosen
for
my
first
village
and
chapel
he
saw
at
a
short
distance
a
stone
building
which
was
raised
only
a
little
above
the
windows
and
directing
his
steps
towards
it
he
stopped
only
twenty
or
thirty
feet
distant
and
asked
me
whose
house
is
this
it
is
mine
my
it
is
yours
he
replied
and
to
whom
does
that
fine
garden
belong
it
is
mine
also
my
well
well
he
rejoined
where
did
you
get
the
money
to
purchase
that
fine
piece
of
land
and
build
that
house
i
got
the
money
where
every
honest
man
gets
what
he
possesses
in
my
hard
labor
and
in
the
sweat
of
my
brow
i
replied
i
want
that
house
and
that
piece
of
land
rejoined
the
bishop
with
an
imperative
voice
so
do
i
i
replied
you
must
give
me
that
house
with
the
land
on
which
it
is
built
said
the
bishop
i
can
not
give
them
as
long
as
i
am
in
need
of
them
my
lord
i
replied
i
see
that
you
are
a
bad
priest
as
i
have
often
been
told
since
you
disobey
your
bishop
he
rejoined
with
an
angry
manner
i
replied
i
do
not
see
why
i
am
a
bad
priest
because
i
keep
what
my
god
has
given
are
you
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
you
have
no
right
to
possess
any
property
he
answered
yes
my
lord
i
am
ignorant
of
any
law
in
our
holy
church
that
deprives
me
of
any
such
rights
if
however
your
lordship
can
show
me
any
such
law
i
will
give
you
the
title
of
that
property
just
if
there
is
not
such
a
law
he
replied
stamping
on
the
ground
with
his
feet
i
will
get
one
my
lord
i
replied
you
are
a
great
bishop
you
have
great
power
in
the
church
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
great
enough
to
have
such
a
law
passed
in
our
holy
church
you
are
an
insolent
priest
he
answered
with
an
accent
of
terrible
anger
and
i
will
make
you
repent
for
your
he
then
turned
his
face
towards
the
chapel
without
waiting
for
my
answer
and
ordered
the
horses
put
in
the
carriage
that
he
might
leave
in
the
shortest
possible
time
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
had
left
anne
where
he
was
never
to
come
again
the
visit
of
that
mitred
thief
with
his
two
profligate
priests
though
very
short
did
much
by
the
mercy
of
god
to
prepare
our
minds
to
understand
that
rome
is
the
harlot
of
the
bible
which
seduces
and
intoxicates
the
nations
with
the
wine
of
her
prostitution
chapter
liii
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
virgin
mary
the
december
pope
pius
ix
was
sitting
on
his
throne
a
triple
crown
of
gold
and
diamonds
was
on
his
head
silk
and
and
white
vestments
on
his
shoulders
five
hundred
mitred
prelates
were
surrounding
him
and
more
than
fifty
thousand
people
were
at
his
feet
in
the
incomparable
peter
s
church
of
rome
after
a
few
minutes
of
most
solemn
silence
a
cardinal
dressed
with
his
purpled
robe
left
his
seat
and
gravely
walked
towards
the
pope
kneeled
before
him
and
humbly
prostrating
himself
at
his
feet
said
holy
father
tell
us
if
we
can
believe
and
teach
that
the
mother
of
god
the
holy
virgin
mary
was
immaculate
in
her
conception
the
supreme
pontiff
answered
i
do
not
know
let
us
ask
the
light
of
the
holy
the
cardinal
withdrew
the
pope
and
the
numberless
multitude
fell
on
their
knees
and
the
harmonious
choir
sang
the
veni
creator
the
last
note
of
the
sacred
hymn
had
hardly
rolled
under
the
vaults
of
the
temple
when
the
same
cardinal
left
his
place
and
again
advanced
towards
the
throne
of
the
pontiff
prostrated
himself
at
his
feet
and
said
holy
father
tell
us
if
the
holy
mother
of
god
the
blessed
virgin
mary
was
immaculate
in
her
the
pope
again
answered
i
do
not
know
let
us
ask
the
light
of
the
holy
and
again
the
veni
creator
spiritus
was
sung
the
most
solemn
silence
had
a
second
time
succeeded
to
the
melodious
sacred
song
when
again
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
were
following
the
grave
steps
of
the
cardinal
advancing
for
the
third
time
to
the
throne
of
the
successor
of
peter
to
ask
again
holy
father
tell
us
if
we
can
believe
that
the
blessed
virgin
mary
the
mother
of
god
was
immaculate
the
pope
as
if
he
had
just
received
a
direct
communication
from
god
answered
with
a
solemn
voice
yes
we
must
believe
that
the
blessed
virgin
mary
the
mother
of
god
was
immaculate
in
her
conception
there
is
no
salvation
to
those
who
do
not
believe
this
dogma
and
with
a
loud
voice
the
pope
intoned
the
te
deum
the
bells
of
three
hundred
churches
of
rome
rang
the
cannons
of
the
citadel
were
fired
the
last
act
of
the
most
ridiculous
and
sacrilegious
comedy
the
world
has
ever
seen
was
over
the
doors
of
heaven
were
for
ever
shut
against
those
who
would
refuse
to
believe
the
doctrine
that
there
is
a
daughter
of
eve
who
has
not
inherited
the
sinful
nature
of
adam
to
whom
the
lord
said
in
his
justice
dust
thou
art
and
unto
dust
shalt
thou
return
and
of
the
children
of
whom
the
god
of
truth
has
said
is
none
righteous
no
not
one
they
have
all
sinned
we
look
in
vain
to
the
first
centuries
of
the
church
to
find
any
traces
of
that
human
aberration
the
first
dark
clouds
which
satan
had
brought
to
mar
the
gospel
truth
on
that
subject
appeared
only
between
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
but
in
the
beginning
that
error
made
very
slow
progress
those
who
propagated
it
at
first
were
a
few
ignorant
fanatics
whose
names
are
lost
in
the
night
of
the
dark
ages
it
is
only
in
the
twelfth
century
that
it
began
to
be
openly
preached
by
some
brainless
monks
but
then
it
was
opposed
by
the
most
learned
men
of
the
time
we
have
a
very
remarkable
letter
of
bernard
to
refute
some
monks
of
lyons
who
were
preaching
this
new
doctrine
a
little
later
peter
lombard
adopted
the
views
of
the
monks
of
lyons
and
wrote
a
book
to
support
that
opinion
but
he
was
refuted
by
thomas
aquinas
who
is
justly
considered
by
the
church
of
rome
as
the
best
theologian
of
that
time
after
that
the
celebrated
order
of
the
franciscans
used
all
their
influence
to
persuade
the
world
that
mary
was
immaculate
in
her
conception
but
they
were
vigorously
opposed
and
refuted
by
the
not
less
celebrated
order
of
the
dominicans
these
two
learned
and
powerful
bodies
during
more
than
a
century
attacked
each
other
without
mercy
on
that
subject
and
filled
the
world
with
the
noise
of
their
angry
disputes
both
parties
calling
their
adversaries
heretics
they
succeeded
in
driving
the
roman
catholics
of
europe
into
two
camps
of
fierce
enemies
the
immaculate
conception
became
the
subject
of
burning
discussions
not
only
between
the
learned
universities
between
the
bishops
and
the
priests
and
the
nuns
of
those
days
but
it
divided
the
families
into
two
fiercely
contending
parties
it
was
discussed
attacked
and
defended
not
only
in
the
chairs
of
universities
and
the
pulpits
of
the
cathedrals
but
also
in
the
fields
and
in
the
very
streets
of
the
cities
and
when
the
two
parties
had
exhausted
the
reasons
which
their
ingenuity
their
learning
or
their
ignorant
fanaticism
could
suggest
to
prove
or
deny
the
immaculate
conception
they
often
had
recourse
to
the
stick
and
to
the
sword
to
sustain
their
arguments
it
will
appear
almost
incredible
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
greatest
number
of
the
large
cities
of
europe
particularly
in
spain
were
then
reddened
with
the
blood
of
the
supporters
and
opponents
of
that
doctrine
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
these
contests
which
were
troubling
the
peace
of
their
subjects
the
kings
of
europe
sent
deputation
after
deputation
to
the
popes
to
know
from
their
infallible
authority
what
to
believe
on
the
subject
philip
iii
and
philip
iv
made
what
we
may
call
supreme
efforts
to
force
the
popes
paul
gregory
and
alexander
to
stop
the
shedding
of
blood
and
disarm
the
combatants
by
raising
the
opinion
in
favor
of
the
immaculate
conception
to
the
dignity
of
a
catholic
dogma
but
they
failed
the
only
answer
they
could
get
from
the
infallible
head
of
the
church
of
rome
was
that
that
dogma
was
not
revealed
in
the
holy
scriptures
had
never
been
taught
by
the
apostles
nor
by
the
fathers
and
had
never
been
believed
or
preached
by
the
church
of
rome
as
an
article
of
faith
the
only
thing
the
popes
could
do
to
please
the
supplicant
kings
and
bishops
and
nations
of
europe
in
those
days
was
to
both
parties
to
call
each
other
and
to
to
say
that
it
was
an
article
of
faith
which
ought
to
be
believed
to
be
saved
at
the
council
of
trent
the
franciscans
and
all
the
partisans
of
the
immaculate
conception
gathered
her
strength
to
have
a
decree
in
favor
of
the
new
dogma
but
the
majority
of
the
bishops
were
visibly
against
that
sacrilegious
innovation
and
they
failed
it
was
reserved
to
the
unfortunate
pius
to
drag
the
church
of
rome
to
that
last
limit
of
human
folly
in
the
last
century
a
monk
called
father
leonard
had
a
dream
in
which
he
heard
the
virgin
mary
telling
him
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
wars
in
the
world
and
to
the
heresies
and
schism
in
the
church
only
after
a
pope
should
have
obliged
by
a
decree
all
the
faithful
to
believe
that
she
was
in
her
that
dream
under
the
name
of
a
celestial
vision
had
been
extensively
circulated
by
means
of
little
tracts
many
believed
it
to
be
a
genuine
revelation
from
heaven
and
unfortunately
the
good
natured
but
pius
was
among
the
number
when
he
was
an
exile
in
gaeta
he
had
himself
a
dream
which
he
took
for
a
vision
on
the
same
subject
he
saw
the
virgin
who
told
him
that
he
should
come
back
to
rome
and
get
an
eternal
peace
for
the
church
only
after
he
should
have
promised
to
declare
that
the
immaculate
conception
was
a
dogma
which
every
one
had
to
believe
to
be
saved
he
awoke
from
his
dream
much
impressed
by
it
and
the
first
thing
he
did
when
up
was
to
make
a
vow
to
promulgate
the
new
dogma
as
soon
as
he
should
be
back
to
rome
and
the
world
has
seen
how
he
has
fulfilled
that
vow
but
by
the
promulgation
of
this
new
dogma
pius
far
from
securing
an
eternal
peace
to
his
church
far
from
destroying
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
the
heresies
which
are
attacking
rome
on
every
side
has
done
more
to
shake
the
faith
of
the
roman
catholics
than
all
their
enemies
by
trying
to
force
this
new
article
of
faith
on
the
consciences
of
his
people
in
a
time
that
so
many
can
judge
for
themselves
and
read
the
records
of
past
generations
he
has
pulled
down
the
strongest
column
which
was
supporting
the
whole
fabric
of
his
church
he
forever
destroyed
the
best
arguments
which
the
priests
had
to
offer
to
the
ignorant
deluded
multitudes
which
they
kept
so
abjectly
tied
to
their
feet
no
words
can
sufficiently
express
the
dignified
and
supreme
contempt
with
which
before
that
epoch
the
priests
of
rome
were
speaking
of
the
new
articles
of
faith
the
novelties
of
the
luther
calvin
knox
c
how
eloquent
were
the
priests
of
rome
before
the
of
december
when
saying
to
their
poor
ignorant
dupes
in
our
holy
church
of
rome
there
is
no
change
no
innovations
no
novelties
no
new
dogmas
we
believe
just
what
our
fathers
believed
and
what
they
have
taught
us
we
belong
to
the
apostolical
church
which
means
we
believe
only
what
apostles
have
believed
and
and
the
ignorant
multitudes
were
saying
amen
but
alas
for
the
poor
priests
of
rome
those
dignified
nonsenses
those
precious
and
dear
illusions
are
impossible
they
have
to
confess
that
those
denunciations
against
what
they
call
the
doctrines
of
the
heretics
were
nothing
but
big
guns
loaded
to
the
mouth
to
destroy
the
protestants
which
are
discharging
their
deadly
missiles
against
the
crumbling
walls
of
their
church
of
rome
they
have
to
confess
that
their
pretensions
to
an
unchangeable
creed
is
all
mere
humbug
shameful
lies
they
have
to
confess
that
the
church
of
rome
is
forging
new
dogmas
new
articles
of
faith
they
do
not
any
longer
dare
to
say
to
the
disciples
of
the
gospel
where
was
your
religion
before
the
days
of
luther
and
calvin
for
the
secret
voice
of
their
conscience
says
to
the
roman
catholics
where
was
your
religion
before
the
of
december
and
they
can
not
answer
there
is
an
inexorable
and
irresistible
logic
in
the
minds
even
of
the
most
unlearned
men
which
defies
all
the
sophisms
of
the
priests
of
rome
if
they
dare
to
speak
again
on
their
pet
subjects
the
novelties
and
new
dogmas
of
the
there
is
a
silent
but
crushing
voice
going
from
the
crowds
to
the
priest
telling
him
now
be
quiet
and
silent
on
what
you
are
used
to
call
the
novelties
and
new
doctrines
of
the
protestants
for
are
you
not
preaching
to
us
an
awful
novelty
are
you
not
damning
us
for
disbelieving
a
thing
which
the
church
during
eighteen
hundred
years
has
a
hundred
times
solemnly
declared
by
the
mouth
of
the
popes
had
never
been
revealed
in
the
holy
scriptures
had
never
been
taught
by
the
fathers
had
never
been
heard
of
by
the
church
herself
i
will
never
forget
the
sadness
which
overcame
me
when
i
received
the
order
from
bishop
o
regan
to
proclaim
that
new
dogma
to
my
people
then
all
roman
catholics
it
was
as
if
an
earthquake
had
shaken
and
destroyed
the
ground
on
which
my
feet
were
resting
my
most
cherished
illusions
about
the
immutability
and
the
infallibility
of
my
church
were
crumbling
down
in
my
intelligence
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
keep
them
up
i
have
seen
old
priests
to
whom
i
opened
my
mind
on
that
subject
shed
tears
of
sorrow
on
the
injury
this
new
dogma
would
do
to
the
church
the
archbishop
of
paris
at
the
head
of
the
most
learned
members
of
the
clergy
of
france
had
sent
his
protest
to
the
pope
against
this
dogma
before
it
was
decreed
and
he
had
eloquently
foretold
the
deplorable
consequences
which
would
follow
that
innovation
but
their
warning
voice
failed
to
make
any
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
infatuated
pope
and
we
children
of
god
must
we
not
acknowledge
the
hand
of
the
lord
in
that
blindness
of
the
man
of
sin
the
days
are
not
far
away
that
a
cry
of
joy
will
be
heard
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
babylon
is
fallen
babylon
is
fallen
because
she
made
all
nations
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
for
when
we
see
that
wicked
one
who
exalteth
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
destroying
himself
by
the
excess
of
his
own
folly
and
impurities
we
must
bless
the
lord
the
proclamation
of
this
new
dogma
is
one
of
those
great
moral
iniquities
which
carry
their
punishment
and
their
remedy
in
their
own
hands
when
the
pope
in
the
morning
of
the
of
december
answered
twice
i
do
not
know
to
the
question
put
to
him
is
the
virgin
mary
immaculate
in
her
conception
and
then
a
minute
after
to
the
same
question
he
answered
yes
i
know
it
the
holy
virgin
mary
was
immaculate
in
her
conception
he
proved
to
his
most
credulous
dupes
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
sacrilegious
comedian
how
would
a
jury
of
honest
men
deal
with
a
witness
who
being
interrogated
about
what
he
knows
of
a
certain
fact
would
answer
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
a
moment
after
would
acknowledge
that
he
knows
everything
about
it
would
not
such
a
witness
be
justly
punished
as
a
perjurer
such
is
the
sad
and
unenviable
position
which
the
pope
made
to
himself
and
to
his
church
on
the
of
december
interrogated
by
the
nations
of
europe
about
what
was
to
be
believed
on
the
conception
of
the
virgin
mary
the
church
of
rome
during
ten
centuries
had
answered
i
do
not
and
let
every
one
remember
that
she
wants
to
be
believed
infallible
when
she
says
she
knows
nothing
about
the
immaculate
but
that
same
church
assures
us
through
the
infallible
decree
of
pius
that
she
knows
and
that
she
has
known
and
believed
that
the
virgin
mary
was
immaculate
has
the
world
ever
seen
such
a
want
of
such
an
unblushing
impudence
what
verdict
will
the
christian
world
give
against
that
great
mother
of
lies
what
punishment
will
the
god
of
truth
administer
to
that
great
culprit
who
swears
yes
and
no
on
the
same
question
it
is
a
fact
that
by
the
promulgation
of
this
decree
pius
ix
had
forever
destroyed
his
prestige
in
the
minds
of
millions
of
his
followers
a
few
days
after
i
had
read
to
my
congregation
the
decree
of
the
pope
proclaiming
the
new
dogma
and
damning
all
those
who
would
not
believe
it
one
of
my
most
intelligent
and
respectable
farmers
came
to
visit
me
and
put
to
me
the
following
questions
on
the
new
articles
of
faith
mr
chiniquy
please
tell
me
have
i
correctly
understood
the
letter
from
the
pope
you
read
us
last
sabbath
does
the
pope
tell
us
in
that
letter
that
we
can
find
this
new
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
in
the
holy
scriptures
that
it
has
been
taught
by
the
fathers
and
that
the
church
has
constantly
believed
it
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
i
answered
yes
my
friend
the
pope
tells
us
all
those
things
in
his
letter
which
i
read
in
the
church
last
but
sir
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
read
me
the
verses
of
the
holy
scriptures
which
are
in
favor
of
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
holy
virgin
mary
my
dear
friend
i
answered
now
please
tell
me
the
names
of
the
holy
fathers
who
have
preached
that
we
must
believe
in
the
immaculate
conception
or
be
forever
damned
if
we
do
not
believe
in
it
i
answered
my
parishioner
i
would
have
preferred
my
dear
friend
that
you
should
have
never
come
to
put
to
me
these
questions
but
as
you
ask
me
the
truth
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
studied
the
fathers
with
a
pretty
good
attention
but
i
have
not
yet
found
a
single
one
of
them
who
was
of
that
opinion
in
any
i
hope
added
the
good
farmer
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
put
to
you
another
question
on
this
subject
perhaps
you
do
not
know
it
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
feeling
and
talking
about
this
new
article
of
faith
among
us
since
last
sabbath
i
want
to
know
a
little
more
about
it
the
pope
says
in
his
letter
that
the
church
of
rome
has
always
believed
and
taught
that
dogma
of
immaculate
conception
is
that
correct
yes
my
friend
the
pope
says
that
in
his
encyclical
but
these
last
nine
hundred
years
more
than
one
hundred
popes
have
declared
that
the
church
had
never
believed
it
even
several
popes
have
forbidden
to
say
that
the
immaculate
conception
was
an
article
of
faith
they
solemnly
permitted
us
to
believe
and
say
what
we
please
on
that
if
it
be
so
with
this
new
dogma
how
can
we
know
it
is
not
so
with
the
other
dogmas
of
our
church
as
the
confession
the
purgatory
etc
added
the
farmer
my
dear
friend
do
not
allow
the
devil
to
shake
your
faith
we
are
living
in
bad
days
indeed
let
us
pray
god
to
enlighten
us
and
save
us
i
would
have
given
much
had
you
never
put
to
me
these
questions
my
honest
parishioner
had
left
me
but
his
awful
questions
they
were
really
awful
as
they
are
still
awful
for
a
priest
of
rome
and
the
answers
i
had
been
forced
to
give
were
sounding
in
my
soul
as
there
was
in
my
poor
trembling
heart
as
the
awful
noise
of
an
irresistible
storm
which
was
to
destroy
all
that
i
had
so
dearly
cherished
and
respected
in
my
then
so
dear
and
venerated
church
of
rome
my
head
was
aching
i
fell
on
my
knees
but
for
a
time
i
could
not
utter
a
word
of
prayer
big
tears
were
rolling
on
my
burning
cheeks
new
light
was
coming
before
the
eyes
of
my
soul
but
i
took
it
for
the
deceitful
temptation
of
satan
a
voice
was
speaking
to
was
the
voice
of
my
god
telling
me
come
out
from
babylon
but
i
took
that
voice
for
the
voice
of
satan
i
was
trying
to
silence
it
the
lord
was
then
drawing
me
away
from
my
perishing
ways
but
i
did
not
know
him
then
i
was
struggling
against
him
to
remain
in
the
dark
dungeons
of
error
but
god
was
to
be
the
stronger
in
his
infinite
mercy
he
was
to
overpower
his
unfaithful
servant
he
was
to
conquer
me
and
with
me
many
others
chapter
liv
the
abominations
of
auricular
confession
there
are
two
women
who
ought
to
be
constant
objects
of
the
compassion
of
the
disciples
of
christ
and
for
whom
daily
prayers
ought
to
be
offered
at
the
brahmin
woman
who
deceived
by
her
priests
burns
herself
on
the
corpse
of
her
husband
to
appease
the
wrath
of
her
wooden
gods
and
the
roman
catholic
woman
who
not
less
deceived
by
her
priests
suffers
a
torture
far
more
cruel
and
ignominious
in
the
to
appease
the
wrath
of
her
for
i
do
not
exaggerate
when
i
say
that
for
many
women
to
be
forced
to
unveil
their
hearts
before
the
eyes
of
a
man
to
open
to
him
all
the
most
secret
recesses
of
their
souls
all
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
their
single
or
married
life
to
allow
him
to
put
to
them
questions
which
the
most
depraved
woman
would
never
consent
to
hear
from
her
vilest
seducer
is
often
more
horrible
and
intolerable
than
to
be
tied
on
burning
coals
more
than
once
i
have
seen
women
fainting
in
the
who
told
me
afterwards
that
the
necessity
of
speaking
to
an
unmarried
man
on
certain
things
on
which
the
most
common
laws
of
decency
ought
to
have
forever
sealed
their
lips
had
almost
killed
them
not
hundreds
but
thousands
of
times
i
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
dying
girls
as
well
as
married
women
the
awful
words
i
am
forever
lost
all
my
past
confessions
and
communions
have
been
so
many
sacrileges
i
have
never
dared
to
answer
correctly
the
questions
of
my
confessors
shame
has
sealed
my
lips
and
damned
my
soul
how
many
times
i
remained
as
one
petrified
by
the
side
of
a
corpse
when
these
last
words
having
hardly
escaped
the
lips
of
one
of
my
female
penitents
who
had
been
snatched
out
of
my
reach
by
the
merciless
hand
of
death
before
i
could
give
her
pardon
through
the
deceitful
sacramental
absolution
i
then
believed
as
the
dead
sinner
herself
had
believed
that
she
should
not
be
forgiven
except
by
that
absolution
for
there
are
not
only
thousands
but
millions
of
roman
catholic
girls
and
women
whose
keen
sense
of
modest
and
womanly
dignity
are
above
all
the
sophisms
and
diabolical
machinations
of
their
priests
they
never
can
be
persuaded
to
answer
yes
to
certain
questions
of
their
confessors
they
would
prefer
to
be
thrown
into
the
flames
and
burnt
to
ashes
with
the
brahmin
widows
rather
than
allow
the
eyes
of
a
man
to
pry
into
the
sacred
sanctuary
of
their
souls
though
sometimes
guilty
before
god
and
under
the
impression
that
their
sins
will
never
be
forgiven
if
not
confessed
the
laws
of
decency
are
stronger
in
their
hearts
than
the
laws
of
their
perfidious
church
no
consideration
not
even
the
fear
of
eternal
damnation
can
persuade
them
to
declare
to
a
sinful
man
sins
which
god
alone
has
the
right
to
know
for
he
alone
can
blot
them
out
with
the
blood
of
his
son
shed
on
the
cross
but
what
a
wretched
life
must
that
be
of
those
exceptional
noble
souls
which
rome
keeps
in
the
dark
dungeons
of
her
superstition
they
read
in
all
their
books
and
hear
from
all
their
pulpits
that
if
they
conceal
a
single
sin
from
their
confessors
they
are
forever
lost
but
being
absolutely
unable
to
trample
under
their
feet
the
laws
of
and
decency
which
god
himself
has
impressed
in
their
souls
they
live
in
constant
dread
of
eternal
damnation
no
human
words
can
tell
their
desolation
and
distress
when
at
the
feet
of
their
confessors
they
find
themselves
under
the
horrible
necessity
of
speaking
of
things
on
which
they
would
prefer
to
suffer
the
most
cruel
death
rather
than
to
open
their
lips
or
to
be
forever
damned
if
they
do
not
degrade
themselves
forever
in
their
own
eyes
by
speaking
on
matters
which
a
respectable
woman
will
never
reveal
to
her
own
mother
much
less
to
a
man
i
have
known
only
too
many
of
these
women
who
when
alone
with
god
in
a
real
agony
of
desolation
and
with
burning
tears
had
asked
him
to
grant
them
what
they
considered
the
greatest
favor
which
was
to
lose
so
much
of
their
as
to
be
enabled
to
speak
of
those
unmentionable
things
just
as
their
confessors
wanted
them
to
speak
and
hoping
that
their
petition
had
been
granted
they
went
again
to
the
determined
to
unveil
their
shame
before
the
eyes
of
that
inexorable
man
but
when
the
moment
had
come
for
the
their
courage
failed
their
knees
trembled
their
lips
became
pale
as
death
cold
sweat
poured
from
all
their
pores
the
voice
of
modesty
and
womanly
was
speaking
louder
than
the
voice
of
their
false
religion
they
had
to
go
out
of
the
with
the
burden
of
a
new
sacrilege
on
their
conscience
oh
how
heavy
is
the
yoke
of
bitter
is
human
cheerless
is
the
mystery
of
the
cross
to
those
deluded
and
perishing
souls
how
gladly
they
would
rush
into
the
blazing
piles
with
the
brahmin
women
if
they
could
hope
to
see
the
end
of
their
unspeakable
miseries
through
the
momentary
tortures
which
would
open
to
them
a
better
life
i
do
here
publicly
challenge
the
whole
roman
catholic
priesthood
to
deny
that
the
greater
part
of
their
female
penitents
remain
a
certain
period
of
longer
some
that
most
distressing
state
of
mind
yes
by
far
the
greater
majority
of
women
at
first
find
it
impossible
to
pull
down
the
sacred
barriers
of
which
god
himself
has
built
around
their
hearts
intelligences
and
souls
as
the
best
safeguard
against
the
snares
of
this
polluted
world
those
laws
of
by
which
they
can
not
consent
to
speak
an
impure
word
into
the
ears
of
a
man
and
which
shut
all
the
avenues
of
the
heart
against
his
unchaste
questions
even
when
speaking
in
the
name
of
laws
of
are
so
clearly
written
on
their
conscience
and
they
are
so
well
understood
by
them
to
be
a
most
divine
gift
that
as
i
have
already
said
many
prefer
to
run
the
risk
of
being
forever
lost
by
remaining
silent
it
takes
many
years
of
the
most
ingenious
i
do
not
hesitate
to
call
it
diabolical
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
priests
to
persuade
the
majority
of
their
female
penitents
to
speak
on
questions
which
even
pagan
savages
would
blush
to
mention
among
themselves
some
persist
in
remaining
silent
on
those
matters
during
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
and
many
of
them
prefer
to
throw
themselves
into
the
hands
of
their
merciful
god
and
die
without
submitting
to
the
defiling
ordeal
even
after
they
have
felt
the
poisonous
stings
of
the
enemy
rather
than
receive
their
pardon
from
a
man
who
as
they
feel
would
surely
have
been
scandalized
by
the
recital
of
their
human
frailties
all
the
priests
of
rome
are
aware
of
this
natural
disposition
of
their
female
penitents
there
is
not
a
single
not
a
single
one
of
their
moral
theologians
who
does
not
warn
the
confessors
against
that
stern
and
general
determination
of
the
girls
and
married
women
never
to
speak
in
the
confessional
on
matters
which
may
more
or
less
deal
with
sins
against
the
seventh
commandment
dens
liguori
debreyene
bailly
a
word
all
the
theologians
of
rome
own
that
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
which
the
confessors
have
to
contend
with
in
the
not
a
single
roman
catholic
priest
will
dare
to
deny
what
i
say
on
this
matter
for
they
know
that
it
would
be
easy
for
me
to
overwhelm
them
with
such
a
crowd
of
testimonials
that
their
grand
imposture
would
forever
be
unmasked
i
intend
at
some
future
day
if
god
spares
me
and
gives
me
time
for
it
to
make
known
some
of
the
innumerable
things
which
the
roman
catholic
theologians
and
moralists
have
written
on
this
question
it
will
form
one
of
the
most
curious
books
ever
written
and
it
will
give
unanswerable
evidence
of
the
fact
that
instinctively
without
consulting
each
other
and
with
an
unanimity
which
is
almost
marvellous
the
roman
catholic
women
guided
by
the
honest
instincts
which
god
has
given
them
shrink
from
the
snares
put
before
them
in
the
and
that
everywhere
they
struggle
to
nerve
themselves
with
a
superhuman
courage
against
the
torturer
who
is
sent
by
the
pope
to
finish
their
ruin
and
to
make
shipwrecks
of
their
souls
everywhere
woman
feels
that
there
are
things
which
ought
never
to
be
told
as
there
are
things
which
ought
never
to
be
done
in
the
presence
of
the
god
of
holiness
she
understands
that
to
recite
the
history
of
certain
sins
even
of
thought
is
not
less
shameful
and
criminal
than
to
do
them
she
hears
the
voice
of
god
whispering
into
her
ears
perhaps
the
world
has
never
seen
a
more
terrible
desperate
solemn
struggle
than
the
one
which
is
going
on
in
the
soul
of
a
poor
trembling
young
woman
who
at
the
feet
of
that
man
has
to
decide
whether
or
not
she
will
open
her
lips
on
those
things
which
the
infallible
voice
of
god
united
to
the
no
less
infallible
voice
of
her
womanly
honor
and
tell
her
never
to
reveal
to
any
man
the
history
of
that
secret
fierce
desperate
struggle
has
never
yet
so
far
as
i
know
been
fully
given
it
would
draw
the
tears
of
admiration
and
compassion
of
the
whole
world
if
it
could
be
written
with
its
simple
sublime
and
terrible
realities
how
many
times
i
have
wept
as
a
child
when
some
and
intelligent
young
girl
or
some
respectable
married
woman
yielding
to
the
sophisms
with
which
i
or
some
other
confessor
had
persuaded
them
to
give
up
their
and
their
womanly
dignity
to
speak
with
me
on
matters
on
which
a
decent
woman
should
never
say
a
word
with
a
man
they
have
told
me
of
their
invincible
repugnance
their
horror
of
such
questions
and
answers
and
they
have
asked
me
to
have
pity
on
them
yes
i
have
often
wept
bitterly
on
my
degradation
when
a
priest
of
rome
i
have
realized
all
the
strength
the
grandeur
and
the
holiness
of
their
motives
for
being
silent
on
these
defiling
matters
and
i
could
not
but
admire
them
it
seemed
at
times
that
they
were
speaking
the
language
of
angels
of
light
that
i
ought
to
fall
at
their
feet
and
ask
their
pardon
for
having
spoken
to
them
of
questions
on
which
a
man
of
honor
ought
never
to
converse
with
a
woman
whom
he
respects
but
alas
i
had
soon
to
reproach
myself
and
regret
those
short
instances
of
my
wavering
faith
in
the
infallible
voice
of
my
church
i
had
soon
to
silence
the
voice
of
my
conscience
which
was
telling
me
is
it
not
a
shame
that
you
an
unmarried
man
dare
to
speak
on
these
matters
with
a
woman
do
you
not
blush
to
put
such
questions
to
a
young
girl
where
is
your
is
your
fear
of
god
do
you
not
promote
the
ruin
of
that
girl
by
forcing
her
to
speak
on
these
matters
how
many
times
my
god
has
spoken
to
me
as
he
speaks
to
all
the
priests
of
rome
and
said
with
a
thundering
voice
what
would
that
young
man
do
could
he
hear
the
questions
you
put
to
his
wife
would
he
not
blow
out
your
brains
and
that
father
would
he
not
pass
his
dagger
through
your
breast
if
he
could
know
what
you
ask
from
his
poor
trembling
daughter
would
not
the
brother
of
that
young
girl
put
an
end
to
your
miserable
life
if
he
could
hear
the
unmentionable
subjects
on
which
you
speak
with
her
in
the
confessional
i
was
compelled
by
all
the
popes
the
moral
theologians
and
the
councils
of
rome
to
believe
that
this
warning
voice
of
my
merciful
god
was
the
voice
of
satan
i
had
to
believe
in
spite
of
my
own
conscience
and
intelligence
that
it
was
good
nay
necessary
to
put
those
polluting
damning
questions
my
infallible
church
was
mercilessly
forcing
me
to
oblige
those
poor
trembling
weeping
desolate
girls
and
women
to
swim
with
me
and
all
their
priests
in
those
waters
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
under
the
pretext
that
their
would
be
broken
down
their
fear
of
sin
and
humility
increased
and
that
they
would
be
purified
by
our
absolutions
with
what
supreme
distress
disgust
and
surprise
we
see
a
great
part
of
the
noble
episcopal
church
of
england
struck
by
a
plague
which
seems
incurable
under
the
name
of
puseyism
or
ritualism
bringing
or
less
many
places
the
diabolical
and
filthy
auricular
confession
among
the
protestants
of
england
australia
and
america
the
episcopal
church
is
doomed
to
perish
in
that
dark
and
stinking
pool
of
she
does
not
find
a
prompt
remedy
to
stop
the
plague
brought
by
the
disguised
jesuits
who
are
at
work
everywhere
to
poison
and
enslave
her
too
unsuspecting
daughters
and
sons
in
the
beginning
of
my
priesthood
when
i
was
in
quebec
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
and
embarrassed
to
see
a
very
accomplished
and
beautiful
young
lady
whom
i
used
to
meet
almost
every
week
at
her
father
s
house
entering
the
box
of
my
confessional
she
had
been
used
to
confess
to
another
young
priest
of
my
acquaintance
and
she
was
always
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
most
pious
girls
of
the
city
though
she
had
disguised
herself
as
much
as
possible
in
order
that
i
might
not
know
her
i
felt
sure
that
i
was
not
was
the
amiable
mary
not
being
absolutely
certain
of
the
correctness
of
my
impressions
i
left
her
entirely
under
the
hope
that
she
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
at
the
beginning
she
could
hardly
speak
her
voice
was
suffocated
by
her
sobs
and
through
the
little
apertures
of
the
thin
partition
between
her
and
me
i
saw
two
streams
of
big
tears
trickling
down
her
cheeks
after
much
effort
she
said
dear
father
i
hope
you
do
not
know
me
and
that
you
will
never
try
to
know
am
a
desperately
great
sinner
oh
i
fear
that
i
am
lost
but
if
there
is
still
a
hope
for
me
to
be
saved
for
god
s
sake
do
not
rebuke
me
before
i
begin
my
confession
allow
me
to
ask
you
not
to
pollute
my
ears
by
questions
which
our
confessors
are
in
the
habit
of
putting
to
their
female
penitents
i
have
already
been
destroyed
by
those
questions
before
i
was
seventeen
years
old
god
knows
that
his
angels
are
not
more
pure
than
i
was
but
the
chaplain
of
the
nunnery
where
my
parents
had
sent
me
for
my
education
though
approaching
old
age
put
to
me
in
the
confessional
a
question
which
at
first
i
did
not
understand
but
unfortunately
he
had
put
the
same
questions
to
one
of
my
young
who
made
fun
of
them
in
my
presence
and
explained
them
to
me
for
she
understood
them
too
well
this
first
unchaste
conversation
of
my
life
plunged
my
thoughts
into
a
sea
of
iniquity
till
then
absolutely
unknown
to
me
temptations
of
the
most
humiliating
character
assailed
me
for
a
week
day
and
night
after
which
sins
which
i
would
blot
out
with
my
blood
if
it
were
possible
overwhelmed
my
soul
as
with
a
deluge
but
the
joys
of
the
sinner
are
short
struck
with
terror
at
the
thought
of
the
judgment
of
god
after
a
few
weeks
of
the
most
deplorable
life
i
determined
to
give
up
my
sins
and
reconcile
myself
to
god
covered
with
shame
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
went
to
confess
to
my
old
confessor
whom
i
respected
as
a
saint
and
cherished
as
a
father
it
seems
to
me
that
with
sincere
tears
of
repentance
i
confessed
to
him
the
greatest
part
of
my
sins
though
i
concealed
one
of
them
through
shame
and
respect
for
my
spiritual
guide
but
i
did
not
conceal
from
him
that
the
strange
questions
he
had
put
to
me
at
my
last
confession
were
with
the
natural
corruption
of
my
heart
the
principal
cause
of
my
destruction
he
spoke
to
me
very
kindly
encouraged
me
to
fight
against
my
bad
inclinations
and
at
first
gave
me
very
kind
and
good
advice
but
when
i
thought
he
had
finished
speaking
and
as
i
was
preparing
to
leave
the
he
put
to
me
two
new
questions
of
such
a
polluting
character
that
i
fear
neither
the
blood
of
christ
nor
all
the
fires
of
hell
will
ever
be
able
to
blot
them
out
of
my
memory
those
questions
have
achieved
my
ruin
they
have
stuck
to
my
mind
like
two
deadly
arrows
they
are
day
and
night
before
my
imagination
they
fill
my
arteries
and
veins
with
deadly
poison
it
is
true
that
at
first
they
filled
me
with
horror
and
disgust
but
alas
i
soon
got
so
accustomed
to
them
that
they
seemed
to
be
incorporated
with
me
and
as
if
becoming
a
second
nature
those
thoughts
have
become
a
new
source
of
innumerable
criminal
thoughts
desires
and
actions
a
month
later
we
were
obliged
by
the
rules
of
our
convent
to
go
and
confess
but
by
this
time
i
was
so
completely
lost
that
i
no
longer
blushed
at
the
idea
of
confessing
my
shameful
sins
to
a
man
it
was
the
very
contrary
i
had
a
real
diabolical
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
i
should
have
a
long
conversation
with
my
confessor
on
those
matters
and
that
he
would
ask
me
more
of
his
strange
questions
in
fact
when
i
had
told
him
everything
without
a
blush
be
began
to
interrogate
me
and
god
knows
what
corrupting
things
fell
from
his
lips
into
my
poor
criminal
heart
every
one
of
his
questions
was
thrilling
my
nerves
and
filling
me
with
the
most
shameful
sensations
after
an
hour
of
this
criminal
with
my
old
confessor
for
it
was
nothing
else
but
a
criminal
i
perceived
that
he
was
as
depraved
as
i
was
myself
with
some
words
he
made
a
criminal
proposition
which
i
accepted
with
covered
words
also
and
during
more
than
a
year
we
have
lived
together
on
the
most
sinful
intimacy
though
he
was
much
older
than
i
i
loved
him
in
the
most
foolish
way
when
the
course
of
my
convent
instruction
was
finished
my
parents
called
me
back
to
their
home
i
was
really
glad
of
that
change
of
residence
for
i
was
beginning
to
be
tired
of
my
criminal
life
my
hope
was
that
under
the
directions
of
a
better
confessor
i
should
reconcile
myself
to
god
and
begin
a
christian
life
unfortunately
for
me
my
new
confessor
who
was
very
young
began
also
his
interrogation
he
soon
fell
in
love
with
me
and
i
loved
him
in
a
most
criminal
way
i
have
done
with
him
things
which
i
hope
you
will
never
request
me
to
reveal
to
you
for
they
are
too
monstrous
to
be
repeated
even
in
the
confessional
by
a
woman
to
a
man
i
do
not
say
these
things
to
take
away
the
responsibility
of
my
iniquities
with
my
young
confessor
from
my
shoulders
for
i
think
i
have
been
more
criminal
than
he
was
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
he
was
a
good
and
holy
priest
before
he
knew
me
but
the
questions
he
put
to
me
and
the
answers
i
had
to
give
him
melted
his
know
as
boiling
lead
would
melt
the
ice
on
which
it
flows
i
know
this
is
not
such
a
detailed
confession
as
our
holy
church
requires
me
to
make
but
i
have
thought
it
necessary
for
me
to
give
you
this
short
history
of
the
life
of
the
greatest
and
most
miserable
sinner
who
ever
asked
you
to
help
her
to
come
out
from
the
tomb
of
her
iniquities
this
is
the
way
i
have
lived
these
last
few
years
but
last
sabbath
god
in
his
infinite
mercy
looked
down
upon
me
he
inspired
you
to
give
us
the
prodigal
son
as
a
model
of
true
conversion
and
as
the
most
marvellous
proof
of
the
infinite
compassion
of
the
dear
saviour
for
the
sinner
i
have
wept
day
and
night
since
that
happy
day
when
i
threw
myself
into
the
arms
of
my
loving
merciful
father
even
now
i
can
hardly
speak
because
my
regret
for
my
past
iniquities
and
my
joy
that
i
am
allowed
to
bathe
the
feet
of
the
saviour
with
tears
are
so
great
that
my
voice
is
as
choked
i
was
then
a
very
young
priest
and
never
had
any
words
so
sublime
come
to
my
ears
in
the
her
tears
and
her
sobs
mingled
with
the
frank
declaration
of
the
most
humiliating
actions
had
made
such
a
profound
impression
upon
me
that
i
was
for
some
time
unable
to
speak
it
had
come
to
my
mind
also
that
i
might
be
mistaken
about
her
identity
and
that
perhaps
she
was
not
the
young
lady
that
i
had
imagined
i
could
then
easily
grant
her
first
request
which
was
to
do
nothing
by
which
i
could
know
her
the
second
part
of
her
prayer
was
more
embarrassing
for
the
theologians
are
very
positive
in
ordering
the
confessors
to
question
their
penitents
particularly
those
of
the
female
sex
in
many
circumstances
i
encouraged
her
in
the
best
way
i
could
to
persevere
in
her
good
resolutions
by
invoking
the
blessed
virgin
mary
and
philomene
who
was
then
a
la
just
as
marie
alacoque
is
among
the
blind
slaves
of
rome
i
told
her
that
i
would
pray
and
think
over
the
subject
of
her
second
request
and
i
asked
her
to
come
back
in
a
week
for
my
answer
the
very
same
day
i
went
to
my
own
confessor
the
rev
baillargeon
then
curate
of
quebec
and
afterwards
archbishop
of
canada
i
told
him
the
singular
and
unusual
request
she
had
made
that
i
should
never
put
to
her
any
of
those
questions
suggested
by
the
theologians
to
insure
the
integrity
of
the
confession
i
did
not
conceal
from
him
that
i
was
much
inclined
to
grant
her
that
favor
for
i
repeated
what
i
had
already
several
times
told
him
that
i
was
supremely
disgusted
with
the
infamous
and
polluting
questions
which
the
theologians
forced
us
to
put
to
our
female
penitents
i
told
him
frankly
that
several
old
and
young
priests
had
already
come
to
confess
to
me
and
that
with
the
exception
of
two
they
had
told
me
that
they
could
not
put
those
questions
and
hear
the
answers
they
elicited
without
falling
into
the
most
damnable
sins
my
confessor
seemed
to
be
much
perplexed
about
what
he
should
answer
he
asked
me
to
come
the
next
day
that
he
might
review
some
theological
books
in
the
interval
the
next
day
i
took
down
in
writing
his
answer
which
i
find
in
my
old
manuscripts
and
i
give
it
here
in
all
its
sad
crudity
such
cases
of
the
destruction
of
female
virtue
by
the
questions
of
the
confessors
is
an
unavoidable
evil
it
can
not
be
helped
for
such
questions
are
absolutely
necessary
in
the
greater
part
of
the
cases
with
which
we
have
to
deal
men
generally
confess
their
sins
with
so
much
sincerity
that
there
is
seldom
any
need
for
questioning
them
except
when
they
are
very
ignorant
but
liguori
as
well
as
our
personal
observation
tells
us
that
the
greatest
part
of
girls
and
women
through
a
false
and
criminal
shame
very
seldom
confess
the
sins
they
commit
against
purity
it
requires
the
utmost
charity
in
the
confessors
to
prevent
these
unfortunate
slaves
of
their
secret
passions
from
making
sacrilegious
confessions
and
communions
with
the
greatest
prudence
and
zeal
he
must
question
them
on
those
matters
beginning
with
the
smallest
sins
and
going
little
by
little
as
much
as
possible
by
imperceptible
degrees
to
the
most
criminal
actions
as
it
seems
evident
that
the
penitent
referred
to
in
your
questions
of
yesterday
is
unwilling
to
make
a
full
and
detailed
confession
of
all
her
iniquities
you
can
not
promise
to
absolve
her
without
assuring
yourself
by
wise
and
prudent
questions
that
she
has
confessed
everything
you
must
not
be
discouraged
when
through
the
confessional
or
any
other
way
you
learn
the
fall
of
priests
into
the
common
frailties
of
human
nature
with
their
penitents
our
saviour
knew
very
well
that
the
occasions
and
the
temptations
we
have
to
encounter
in
the
confessions
of
girls
and
women
are
so
numerous
and
sometimes
so
irresistible
that
many
would
fall
but
he
has
given
them
the
holy
virgin
mary
who
constantly
asks
and
obtains
their
pardon
he
has
given
them
the
sacrament
of
penance
where
they
can
receive
their
pardon
as
often
as
they
ask
for
it
the
vow
of
perfect
chastity
is
a
great
honor
and
privilege
but
we
can
not
conceal
from
ourselves
that
it
puts
on
our
shoulders
a
burden
which
many
can
not
carry
forever
liguori
says
that
we
must
not
rebuke
the
penitent
priest
who
falls
only
once
a
month
and
some
other
trustworthy
theologians
are
still
more
this
answer
was
far
from
satisfying
me
it
seemed
to
me
composed
of
soft
soap
principles
i
went
back
with
a
heavy
heart
and
an
anxious
mind
and
god
knows
that
i
made
many
fervent
prayers
that
this
girl
should
never
come
again
to
give
me
her
sad
history
i
was
then
hardly
years
old
full
of
youth
and
life
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
stings
of
a
thousand
wasps
to
my
ears
could
not
do
me
so
much
harm
as
the
words
of
that
dear
beautiful
accomplished
but
lost
girl
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
revelations
which
she
made
had
in
any
way
diminished
my
esteem
and
my
respect
for
her
it
was
just
the
contrary
her
tears
and
her
sobs
at
my
feet
her
agonizing
expressions
of
shame
and
regret
her
noble
words
of
protest
against
the
disgusting
and
polluting
interrogations
of
the
confessors
had
raised
her
very
high
in
my
mind
my
sincere
hope
was
that
she
would
have
a
place
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
with
the
samaritan
women
mary
magdalene
and
all
the
sinners
who
have
washed
their
robes
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
at
the
appointed
day
i
was
in
my
confessional
listening
to
the
confession
of
a
young
man
when
i
saw
miss
mary
entering
the
vestry
and
coming
directly
to
my
where
she
knelt
by
me
though
she
had
still
more
than
at
the
first
time
disguised
herself
behind
a
long
thick
black
veil
i
could
not
be
mistaken
she
was
the
very
same
amiable
young
lady
in
whose
father
s
house
i
used
to
pass
such
pleasant
and
happy
hours
i
had
often
listened
with
breathless
attention
to
her
melodious
voice
when
she
was
giving
us
accompanied
by
her
piano
some
of
our
beautiful
church
hymns
who
could
then
see
and
hear
her
without
almost
worshipping
her
the
dignity
of
her
steps
and
her
whole
mien
when
she
advanced
towards
my
confessional
entirely
betrayed
her
and
destroyed
her
incognito
oh
i
would
have
given
every
drop
of
my
blood
in
that
solemn
hour
that
i
might
have
been
free
to
deal
with
her
just
as
she
had
so
eloquently
requested
me
to
let
her
weep
and
cry
at
the
feet
of
jesus
to
her
heart
s
content
oh
if
i
had
been
free
to
take
her
by
the
hand
and
silently
show
her
the
dying
saviour
that
she
might
have
bathed
his
feet
with
her
tears
and
spread
the
oil
of
her
love
on
his
head
without
my
saying
else
but
go
in
peace
thy
sins
are
but
there
in
that
i
was
not
the
servant
of
christ
to
follow
his
divine
saving
words
and
obey
the
dictates
of
my
honest
conscience
i
was
the
slave
of
the
pope
i
had
to
stifle
the
cry
of
my
conscience
to
ignore
the
inspirations
of
my
god
there
my
conscience
had
no
right
to
speak
my
intelligence
was
a
dead
thing
the
theologians
of
the
pope
alone
had
a
right
to
be
heard
and
obeyed
i
was
not
there
to
save
but
to
destroy
for
under
the
pretext
of
purifying
the
real
mission
of
the
confessor
often
if
not
always
in
spite
of
himself
is
to
scandalize
and
damn
their
souls
as
soon
as
the
young
man
who
was
making
his
confession
at
my
left
hand
had
finished
i
without
noise
turned
myself
towards
her
and
said
through
the
little
aperture
are
you
ready
to
begin
your
confession
but
she
did
not
answer
me
all
that
i
could
hear
was
oh
my
jesus
have
mercy
upon
me
i
come
to
wash
my
soul
in
thy
blood
wilt
thou
rebuke
me
during
several
minutes
she
raised
her
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
and
wept
and
prayed
it
was
evident
that
she
had
not
the
least
idea
that
i
was
observing
her
she
thought
the
door
of
the
little
partition
between
her
and
me
was
shut
but
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
my
tears
were
flowing
with
her
tears
and
my
ardent
prayers
were
going
to
the
feet
of
jesus
with
her
prayers
i
would
not
have
interrupted
her
for
any
consideration
in
this
her
sublime
communication
with
her
merciful
savior
but
after
a
pretty
long
time
i
made
a
little
noise
with
my
hand
and
putting
my
lips
near
the
opening
of
the
partition
which
was
between
us
i
said
in
a
low
voice
dear
sister
are
you
ready
to
begin
your
confession
she
turned
her
face
a
little
towards
me
and
said
with
trembling
voice
yes
dear
father
i
am
but
she
then
stopped
again
to
weep
and
pray
though
i
could
not
hear
what
she
said
after
some
time
in
silent
prayer
i
said
my
dear
sister
if
you
are
ready
please
begin
your
she
then
said
my
dear
father
do
you
remember
the
prayers
which
i
made
to
you
the
other
day
can
you
allow
me
to
confess
my
sins
without
forcing
me
to
forget
the
respect
that
i
owe
to
myself
to
you
and
to
god
who
hears
us
and
can
you
promise
that
you
will
not
put
to
me
any
of
those
questions
which
have
already
done
me
such
irreparable
injury
i
frankly
declare
to
you
that
there
are
sins
in
me
that
i
can
not
reveal
to
anyone
except
to
christ
because
he
is
my
god
and
that
he
already
knows
them
all
let
me
weep
and
cry
at
his
feet
can
you
not
forgive
me
without
adding
to
my
iniquities
by
forcing
me
to
say
things
that
the
tongue
of
a
christian
woman
can
not
reveal
to
a
man
my
dear
sister
i
answered
were
i
free
to
follow
the
voice
of
my
own
feelings
i
would
be
only
too
happy
to
grant
your
request
but
i
am
here
only
as
the
minister
of
our
holy
church
and
bound
to
obey
the
laws
through
her
most
holy
popes
and
theologians
she
tells
me
that
i
can
not
forgive
your
sins
if
you
do
not
confess
them
all
just
as
you
have
committed
them
the
church
tells
me
also
that
you
must
give
the
details
which
may
add
to
the
malice
or
change
the
nature
of
your
sins
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
our
most
holy
theologians
make
it
a
duty
of
our
confessor
to
question
the
penitent
on
the
sins
which
he
has
good
reason
to
suspect
have
been
voluntarily
with
a
piercing
cry
she
exclaimed
then
o
my
god
i
am
lost
this
cry
fell
upon
me
like
a
thunderbolt
but
i
was
still
more
when
looking
through
the
aperture
i
saw
she
was
fainting
i
heard
the
noise
of
her
body
falling
upon
the
floor
and
of
her
head
striking
against
the
sides
of
the
confessional
box
quick
as
lightning
i
ran
to
help
her
took
her
in
my
arms
and
called
a
couple
of
men
who
were
at
a
little
distance
to
assist
me
in
laying
her
on
a
bench
i
washed
her
face
with
some
cold
water
and
vinegar
she
was
as
pale
as
death
but
her
lips
were
moving
and
she
was
saying
something
which
nobody
but
i
could
i
am
forever
we
took
her
home
to
her
disconsolate
family
where
during
a
month
she
lingered
between
life
and
death
her
two
first
confessors
came
to
visit
her
but
having
asked
every
one
to
go
out
of
the
room
she
politely
but
absolutely
requested
them
to
go
away
and
never
come
again
she
asked
me
to
visit
her
every
day
for
she
said
i
have
only
a
few
more
days
to
live
help
me
to
prepare
myself
for
the
solemn
hour
which
will
open
to
me
the
gates
of
eternity
every
day
i
visited
her
and
i
prayed
and
i
wept
with
her
many
times
when
alone
with
tears
i
requested
her
to
finish
her
confession
but
with
a
firmness
which
then
seemed
to
be
mysterious
and
inexplicable
she
politely
rebuked
me
one
day
when
alone
with
her
i
was
kneeling
by
the
side
of
her
bed
to
pray
i
was
unable
to
articulate
a
single
word
because
of
the
inexpressible
anguish
of
my
soul
on
her
account
she
asked
me
dear
father
why
do
you
weep
i
answered
how
can
you
put
such
a
question
to
your
murderer
i
weep
because
i
have
killed
you
dear
this
answer
seemed
to
trouble
her
exceedingly
she
was
very
weak
that
day
after
she
had
wept
and
prayed
in
silence
she
said
do
not
weep
for
me
but
weep
for
so
many
priests
who
destroy
their
penitents
in
the
confessional
i
believe
in
the
holiness
of
the
sacrament
of
penance
since
our
holy
church
has
established
it
but
there
is
somewhere
something
exceedingly
wrong
in
the
confessional
twice
i
have
been
destroyed
and
i
know
many
girls
who
have
also
been
destroyed
by
the
confessional
this
is
a
secret
but
will
that
secret
be
kept
forever
i
pity
the
poor
priests
the
day
that
our
fathers
will
know
what
becomes
of
the
purity
of
their
daughters
in
the
hands
of
their
confessors
father
would
surely
kill
my
two
last
confessors
if
he
could
only
know
they
have
destroyed
his
poor
i
could
not
answer
except
by
weeping
we
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
then
she
said
it
is
true
that
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
rebuke
you
have
given
me
the
other
day
in
the
confessional
but
you
acted
conscientiously
as
a
good
and
honest
priest
i
know
you
must
be
bound
by
certain
she
then
pressed
my
hand
with
her
cold
hand
and
said
she
had
hardly
finished
her
last
word
when
she
fainted
and
i
feared
lest
she
should
die
just
then
when
i
was
alone
with
her
i
called
the
family
who
rushed
into
the
room
the
doctor
was
sent
for
he
found
her
so
weak
that
he
thought
proper
to
allow
only
one
or
two
persons
to
remain
in
the
room
with
me
he
requested
us
not
to
speak
at
all
for
said
he
the
least
emotion
might
kill
her
instantly
her
disease
is
in
all
probability
an
aneurism
of
the
aorta
the
big
vein
which
brings
the
blood
to
the
heart
when
it
breaks
she
will
go
as
quick
as
it
was
nearly
ten
at
night
when
i
left
the
house
to
go
and
take
some
rest
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
i
passed
a
sleepless
night
my
dear
mary
was
there
pale
dying
from
the
deadly
blow
which
i
had
given
her
in
the
confessional
she
was
there
on
her
bed
of
death
her
heart
pierced
with
the
dagger
which
my
church
had
put
into
my
hands
and
instead
of
rebuking
and
cursing
me
for
my
savage
merciless
fanaticism
she
was
blessing
me
she
was
dying
from
a
broken
heart
and
i
was
not
allowed
by
my
church
to
give
her
a
single
word
of
consolation
and
hope
for
she
had
not
made
her
confession
i
had
mercilessly
bruised
that
tender
plant
and
there
was
nothing
in
my
hands
to
heal
the
wounds
i
had
made
it
was
very
probable
that
she
would
die
the
next
day
and
i
was
forbidden
to
show
her
the
crown
of
glory
which
jesus
has
prepared
in
his
kingdom
for
the
repenting
sinner
my
desolation
was
really
unspeakable
and
i
think
i
would
have
been
suffocated
and
have
died
that
night
if
the
stream
of
tears
which
continually
flowed
from
my
eyes
had
not
been
as
a
balm
to
my
distressed
heart
how
dark
and
long
the
hours
of
that
night
seemed
to
me
before
the
dawn
of
day
i
arose
to
read
my
theologians
again
and
see
if
i
could
not
find
some
one
who
would
allow
me
to
forgive
the
sins
of
that
dear
child
without
forcing
her
to
tell
me
anything
she
had
done
but
they
seemed
to
me
more
than
ever
unanimously
inexorable
and
i
put
them
back
on
the
shelves
of
my
library
with
a
broken
heart
at
nine
the
next
day
i
was
by
the
bed
of
our
dear
sick
mary
i
can
not
sufficiently
tell
the
joy
i
felt
when
the
doctor
and
whole
family
said
to
me
she
is
much
better
the
rest
of
last
night
has
wrought
a
marvelous
change
with
a
really
angelic
smile
she
extended
her
hand
towards
me
that
i
might
press
it
in
mine
and
she
said
i
thought
last
evening
that
the
dear
savior
would
take
me
to
him
but
he
wants
me
dear
father
to
give
you
a
little
more
trouble
however
be
patient
it
can
not
be
long
before
the
solemn
hour
of
the
appeal
will
ring
will
you
please
read
me
the
history
of
the
suffering
and
death
of
the
beloved
savior
which
you
read
me
the
other
day
it
does
me
so
much
good
to
see
how
he
has
loved
me
such
a
miserable
there
was
a
calm
and
solemnity
in
her
words
which
struck
me
singularly
as
well
as
all
those
who
were
there
after
i
had
finished
reading
she
exclaimed
he
has
loved
me
so
much
that
he
died
for
my
sins
and
she
shut
her
eyes
as
if
to
meditate
in
silence
but
there
was
a
stream
of
big
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
i
knelt
down
by
her
bed
with
her
family
to
pray
but
i
could
not
utter
a
single
word
the
idea
that
this
dear
child
was
there
dying
from
the
cruel
fanaticism
of
my
theologians
and
my
own
cowardice
in
obeying
them
was
a
to
my
neck
it
was
killing
me
oh
if
by
dying
a
thousand
times
i
could
have
added
a
single
day
to
her
life
with
what
pleasure
i
would
have
accepted
those
thousand
deaths
after
we
had
silently
prayed
and
wept
by
her
bedside
she
requested
her
mother
to
leave
her
alone
with
me
when
i
saw
myself
alone
under
the
irresistible
impression
that
this
was
her
last
day
i
fell
on
my
knees
again
and
with
tears
of
the
most
sincere
compassion
for
her
soul
i
requested
her
to
shake
off
her
shame
and
to
obey
our
holy
church
which
requires
every
one
to
confess
their
sins
if
they
want
to
be
forgiven
she
calmly
but
with
an
air
of
dignity
which
no
human
words
can
express
said
yes
i
said
this
is
what
the
holy
scriptures
tell
well
then
how
is
it
possible
that
our
confessors
dare
to
take
away
from
us
that
holy
divine
coat
of
modesty
and
has
not
almighty
god
himself
made
with
his
own
hands
that
coat
of
womanly
modesty
and
that
we
might
not
be
to
you
and
to
ourselves
a
cause
of
shame
and
sin
i
was
really
stunned
by
the
beauty
simplicity
and
sublimity
of
that
comparison
i
remained
absolutely
mute
and
confounded
though
it
was
demolishing
all
the
traditions
and
doctrines
of
my
church
and
pulverizing
all
my
holy
doctors
and
theologians
that
noble
answer
found
such
an
echo
in
my
soul
that
it
seemed
to
me
a
sacrilege
to
try
to
touch
it
with
my
finger
after
a
short
time
of
silence
she
continued
twice
i
have
been
destroyed
by
priests
in
the
confessional
they
took
away
from
me
that
divine
coat
of
modesty
and
which
god
gives
to
ever
human
being
who
comes
into
this
world
and
twice
i
have
become
for
those
very
priests
a
deep
pit
of
perdition
into
which
they
have
fallen
and
where
i
fear
they
are
forever
lost
my
merciful
heavenly
father
has
given
me
back
that
coat
of
skins
that
nuptial
robe
of
modesty
and
holiness
which
had
been
taken
away
from
me
he
can
not
allow
you
or
any
other
man
to
tear
again
and
spoil
that
vestment
which
is
the
work
of
his
these
words
had
exhausted
her
it
was
evident
to
me
that
she
wanted
some
rest
i
left
her
alone
but
i
was
absolutely
beside
myself
filled
with
admiration
for
the
sublime
lessons
which
i
had
received
from
the
lips
of
that
regenerated
daughter
of
christ
who
it
was
evident
was
soon
to
fly
away
from
us
i
felt
a
supreme
disgust
for
myself
my
theologians
i
say
it
yes
i
felt
in
that
solemn
hour
a
supreme
disgust
for
my
church
which
was
cruelly
defiling
me
and
all
her
priests
in
the
i
felt
in
that
hour
a
supreme
horror
for
that
auricular
confession
which
is
so
often
a
pit
of
perdition
and
supreme
misery
for
the
confessor
and
penitent
i
went
out
and
walked
two
hours
on
the
plains
of
abraham
to
breathe
the
pure
and
refreshing
air
of
the
mountains
there
alone
i
sat
on
a
stone
on
the
very
spot
where
wolf
and
montcalm
fought
and
died
and
i
wept
to
my
heart
s
content
on
my
irreparable
degradation
and
the
degradation
of
so
many
priests
through
the
confessional
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
i
went
back
again
to
the
house
of
my
dear
dying
mary
the
mother
took
me
apart
and
very
politely
said
my
dear
chiniquy
do
you
not
think
it
is
time
that
our
dear
child
should
receive
the
last
sacraments
she
seemed
to
be
much
better
this
morning
and
we
were
full
of
hope
but
she
is
now
rapidly
sinking
please
lose
no
time
in
giving
her
the
holy
viaticum
and
the
extreme
i
said
yes
madam
let
me
pass
a
few
minutes
alone
with
our
dear
child
that
i
may
prepare
her
for
the
last
when
alone
with
her
i
again
fell
on
my
knees
and
amidst
torrents
of
tears
i
said
dear
sister
it
is
my
desire
to
give
you
the
holy
viaticum
and
the
extreme
unction
but
tell
me
how
can
i
dare
do
a
thing
so
solemn
against
all
the
prohibitions
of
our
holy
church
how
can
i
give
you
the
holy
communion
without
first
giving
you
absolution
and
how
can
i
give
you
absolution
when
you
earnestly
persist
in
telling
me
that
you
have
so
many
sins
which
you
will
never
declare
to
me
or
any
other
confessor
you
know
that
i
cherish
and
respect
you
as
if
you
were
an
angel
sent
to
me
from
heaven
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
blessed
the
day
that
you
first
saw
and
knew
me
i
say
the
same
thing
i
bless
the
day
that
i
have
known
you
i
bless
every
hour
that
i
have
spent
by
your
bed
of
suffering
i
bless
every
tear
which
i
have
shed
with
you
on
your
sins
and
on
my
own
i
bless
every
hour
we
have
passed
together
in
looking
to
the
wounds
of
our
beloved
dying
savior
i
bless
you
for
having
forgiven
me
your
death
for
i
know
it
and
i
confess
it
in
the
presence
of
god
i
have
killed
you
dear
sister
but
now
i
prefer
a
thousand
times
to
die
than
to
say
to
you
a
word
which
would
pain
you
in
any
way
or
trouble
the
peace
of
your
soul
please
my
dear
sister
tell
me
what
i
can
and
must
do
for
you
in
this
solemn
hour
calmly
and
with
a
smile
of
joy
such
as
i
had
never
seen
before
nor
seen
since
she
said
i
thank
and
bless
you
dear
father
for
the
parable
of
the
prodigal
son
on
which
you
preached
a
month
ago
you
have
brought
me
to
the
feet
of
the
dear
savior
there
i
have
found
a
peace
and
a
joy
surpassing
anything
that
human
heart
can
feel
i
have
thrown
myself
into
the
arms
of
my
heavenly
father
and
i
know
he
has
mercifully
accepted
and
forgiven
his
poor
prodigal
child
oh
i
see
the
angels
with
their
golden
harps
around
the
throne
of
the
lamb
do
you
not
hear
the
celestial
harmony
of
their
songs
i
go
to
join
them
in
my
father
s
house
i
shall
not
be
lost
while
she
was
thus
speaking
to
me
my
eyes
were
really
turned
into
two
fountains
of
tears
i
was
unable
as
well
as
unwilling
to
see
anything
so
entirely
overcome
was
i
by
the
sublime
words
which
were
flowing
from
the
dying
lips
of
that
dear
child
who
was
no
more
a
sinner
but
a
real
angel
of
heaven
to
me
i
was
listening
to
her
words
there
was
a
celestial
music
in
every
one
of
them
but
she
had
raised
her
voice
in
such
a
strange
way
when
she
had
begun
to
say
and
she
had
made
such
a
cry
of
joy
when
she
had
to
let
the
last
words
not
be
lost
escape
her
lips
that
i
raised
my
head
and
opened
my
eyes
to
look
at
her
i
suspected
that
something
strange
had
occurred
i
got
upon
my
feet
passed
my
handkerchief
over
my
face
to
wipe
away
the
tears
which
were
preventing
me
from
seeing
with
accuracy
and
looked
at
her
her
hands
were
crossed
on
her
breast
and
there
was
on
her
face
the
expression
of
a
really
superhuman
joy
her
beautiful
eyes
were
fixed
as
if
they
were
looking
on
some
grand
and
sublime
spectacle
it
seemed
to
me
at
first
that
she
was
praying
in
that
very
instant
the
mother
rushed
into
the
room
crying
my
god
my
god
what
does
that
cry
mean
her
last
words
not
to
be
lost
particularly
the
last
one
had
been
pronounced
with
such
a
powerful
voice
that
they
had
been
heard
almost
everywhere
in
the
house
i
made
a
sign
with
my
hand
to
prevent
the
distressed
mother
from
making
any
noise
and
troubling
her
dying
child
in
her
prayer
for
i
really
thought
that
she
had
stopped
speaking
as
she
used
so
often
to
do
when
alone
with
me
in
order
to
pray
but
i
was
mistaken
the
redeemed
soul
had
gone
on
the
golden
wings
of
love
to
join
the
multitude
of
those
who
have
washed
their
robes
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
to
sing
the
eternal
alleluia
the
revelation
of
the
unmentionable
corruptions
directly
and
unavoidably
engendered
by
auricular
confession
had
come
to
me
from
the
lips
of
that
young
lady
as
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
which
were
to
hurl
back
the
dark
clouds
of
night
by
which
rome
had
wrapped
my
intelligence
on
that
subject
so
miserable
by
her
fall
and
her
sins
but
so
admirable
by
her
conversion
that
young
lady
was
standing
before
me
for
the
rest
of
my
priestly
life
as
the
bright
beacon
raised
on
the
solitary
rocks
stands
before
the
sailor
whose
ship
is
drifting
through
the
shoals
in
a
dark
and
stormy
night
she
was
brought
there
by
the
merciful
hand
of
god
to
right
my
course
lost
and
degraded
by
auricular
confession
only
after
having
given
it
up
that
precious
soul
was
to
find
peace
and
life
when
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
as
the
only
hope
and
refuge
of
sinners
her
words
filled
with
a
superhuman
wisdom
and
her
burning
tears
came
to
me
by
the
marvelous
providence
of
god
as
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
of
righteousness
to
teach
me
that
auricular
confession
was
a
satanic
invention
had
this
young
person
been
the
only
one
to
tell
me
that
i
might
still
have
held
some
doubt
about
the
diabolical
origin
of
that
institution
but
thousands
and
thousands
before
and
after
her
have
been
sent
by
my
merciful
god
to
tell
me
the
same
tale
till
after
years
of
experience
it
became
a
certitude
to
me
that
that
modern
invention
of
rome
must
sooner
or
later
with
very
few
exceptions
drag
both
the
confessor
and
his
female
penitents
into
a
common
and
irreparable
ruin
d
footnote
d
those
who
would
like
to
know
all
about
the
abominations
of
auricular
confession
should
have
my
volume
the
priest
the
woman
and
the
it
is
probably
the
only
book
ever
written
on
that
subject
which
completely
unveils
the
mask
of
rome
by
telling
the
whole
truth

be
given
next

bishop

louisville
are
to
commence
on
tuesday

and
will
terminate
on

this

will
judge
to

urgent
necessity
by
order
of
rt
rev
bishop
matthew
dillon
wishing
to
study
the
of
that
irish
clergy
of
which
bishop
vandeveld
had
told
such
frightful
things
i
went
to
mary
s
university
two
hours
ahead
of
time
never
did
i
see
such
a
band
of
jolly
fellows
their
dissipation
and
laughter
their
exchange
of
witty
and
too
often
unbecoming
expressions
the
tremendous
noise
they
made
in
addressing
each
other
at
a
distance
their
hallo
patrick
hallo
murphy
the
answers
yes
yes
she
will
never
leave
me
or
no
no
the
crazy
girl
is
gone
were
invariably
followed
by
outbursts
of
laughter
though
of
them
were
evidently
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
drinks
not
one
could
be
said
to
be
drunk
but
the
strong
odor
of
alcohol
mixed
with
the
smoke
of
cigars
soon
poisoned
the
air
and
made
it
suffocating
i
had
withdrawn
in
a
corner
alone
in
order
to
observe
everything
what
stranger
in
entering
that
large
hall
would
have
suspected
that
those
men
were
about
to
begin
one
of
the
most
solemn
and
sacred
actions
of
a
priest
of
jesus
christ
with
the
exception
of
five
or
six
they
looked
more
like
a
band
of
carousing
raftsmen
than
priests
about
an
hour
before
the
opening
of
the
exercises
i
saw
one
of
the
priests
with
hat
in
hand
accompanied
by
two
of
the
fattest
and
most
florid
of
the
band
going
to
every
one
collecting
money
and
with
the
most
hilarity
and
pleasure
each
one
threw
his
bank
bills
into
the
hat
i
supposed
that
this
collection
was
intended
to
pay
for
our
board
during
the
retreat
and
i
prepared
the
i
wanted
to
give
when
they
came
near
big
hat
was
literally
filled
with
five
and
ten
dollar
bills
before
handing
my
money
to
them
i
asked
what
is
the
object
of
that
collection
ah
ah
they
answered
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
the
collectors
laughed
outright
i
answered
politely
but
seriously
gentlemen
i
came
here
to
meditate
and
pray
and
when
i
am
thirsty
the
fresh
and
pure
water
of
lake
michigan
will
quench
my
thirst
i
have
given
up
long
ago
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
please
excuse
me
i
am
a
so
we
are
they
answered
with
a
laugh
we
have
all
taken
the
pledge
from
father
mathew
but
this
does
not
prevent
us
from
taking
a
little
drop
to
quench
our
thirst
and
keep
up
our
health
father
mathew
is
not
so
merciless
as
you
i
know
father
mathew
well
i
answered
i
have
written
to
him
and
seen
him
many
times
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
we
are
of
the
same
mind
about
the
use
of
intoxicating
is
it
possible
you
know
father
mathew
and
you
are
exchanging
letters
with
him
what
a
holy
man
he
is
and
what
good
he
has
done
in
ireland
and
everywhere
they
answered
but
the
good
he
has
done
will
not
last
long
i
said
if
all
his
disciples
keep
their
pledges
as
you
as
we
were
talking
a
good
number
of
priests
came
around
to
hear
what
was
said
for
it
was
evident
to
all
that
the
bark
of
their
collectors
not
only
had
come
to
shallow
waters
but
had
struck
on
a
rock
one
of
the
priests
said
i
thought
we
were
to
be
preached
by
bishop
spaulding
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
father
chiniquy
who
had
that
gentlemen
i
answered
i
have
as
much
right
to
preach
to
you
in
favor
of
temperance
as
you
have
to
preach
to
me
in
favor
of
intemperance
you
may
do
as
you
please
about
the
use
of
strong
drink
during
the
retreat
but
i
hope
i
also
may
have
the
right
to
think
and
do
as
i
please
in
that
of
course
they
all
answered
but
you
are
the
only
one
who
will
not
give
us
a
cent
to
get
a
little
so
much
the
worse
for
you
all
gentlemen
if
i
am
the
only
one
but
please
excuse
me
i
can
not
give
you
a
cent
for
that
they
then
left
me
saying
something
which
i
could
not
understand
but
they
were
evidently
disgusted
with
what
they
considered
my
stubbornness
and
want
of
good
manners
i
must
however
say
here
that
two
of
them
dunn
pastor
of
one
of
the
best
congregations
in
chicago
and
the
other
unknown
to
me
came
to
congratulate
me
on
the
stern
rebuke
i
had
given
the
collectors
i
regret
said
mr
dunn
the
five
dollars
i
have
thrown
into
that
hat
if
i
had
spoken
to
you
before
and
had
known
that
you
would
be
brave
enough
to
rebuke
them
i
would
have
stood
by
you
and
kept
my
money
for
better
use
it
is
really
a
shame
that
we
should
be
preparing
ourselves
for
a
retreat
by
wasting
for
such
a
shameful
object
they
have
just
told
me
that
they
have
raised
that
sum
for
the
champagne
brandy
whisky
and
beer
they
will
drink
this
week
ah
what
disgrace
what
a
cry
of
indignation
would
be
raised
against
us
if
such
a
shameful
thing
should
be
known
i
am
sorry
about
the
unkind
words
those
priests
have
spoken
to
you
but
you
must
excuse
them
they
are
already
full
of
bad
whisky
do
not
think
however
that
you
are
friendless
here
in
our
midst
you
have
more
friends
than
you
think
among
the
irish
priests
and
i
am
one
of
them
though
you
do
not
know
me
bishop
vandeveld
has
often
spoken
to
me
of
your
grand
colonization
work
among
the
dunn
then
pressed
my
hand
in
his
and
taking
me
a
short
distance
from
the
others
said
consider
me
hereafter
as
your
friend
you
have
won
my
confidence
by
the
fearless
way
in
which
you
have
just
spoken
and
the
common
sense
of
your
arguments
you
have
lost
a
true
friend
in
bishop
vandevelde
i
fear
that
our
present
bishop
will
not
do
you
justice
lebel
and
carthyvel
have
prejudiced
him
against
you
but
i
will
stand
by
you
if
you
are
ever
unjustly
dealt
with
as
i
fear
you
will
by
the
present
administration
of
the
diocese
i
fear
we
are
on
the
eve
of
great
evils
the
scandalous
suit
which
bishop
o
regan
has
brought
upon
his
predecessor
is
a
disgrace
if
he
has
gained
by
it
he
has
forever
lost
the
respect
and
confidence
of
all
his
priests
and
diocesans
after
the
mild
and
paternal
ruling
of
bishop
vandevelde
neither
the
priests
nor
the
people
of
illinois
will
long
bear
the
iron
chains
which
the
present
bishop
has
in
store
for
us
i
thanked
dunn
for
his
kind
words
and
told
him
that
i
had
already
tasted
the
paternal
love
of
my
bishop
by
being
twice
dragged
by
spink
before
the
criminal
court
for
having
refused
to
live
on
good
terms
with
the
two
most
demoralized
priests
i
have
ever
known
he
then
speaking
with
a
more
subdued
voice
said
i
must
tell
you
confidentially
that
one
of
those
priests
lebel
will
be
turned
out
ignominiously
from
the
diocese
during
the
retreat
last
week
a
new
fact
which
surpasses
all
his
other
abominations
has
been
revealed
and
proved
to
the
bishop
for
which
he
will
be
at
that
moment
the
bell
called
us
to
the
chapel
to
hear
the
regulations
of
the
bishop
in
reference
to
the
retreat
after
which
we
sang
the
matins
at
we
had
our
first
sermon
by
bishop
spaulding
from
kentucky
he
was
a
man
a
giant
in
stature
and
a
good
speaker
but
the
way
in
which
he
treated
his
subject
though
very
clever
left
in
my
mind
the
impression
that
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
said
at
certain
times
there
was
much
fire
in
his
elocution
but
it
was
a
fire
of
straw
he
delivered
two
sermons
each
day
and
the
rev
vanhulest
a
jesuit
gave
us
two
meditations
each
of
them
lasting
from
forty
to
fifty
minutes
the
rest
of
the
time
was
spent
in
reading
aloud
the
life
of
a
saint
reciting
the
breviarum
examination
of
conscience
and
going
to
confession
we
had
half
an
hour
for
meals
followed
by
one
hour
of
recreation
thus
were
the
days
spent
but
the
nights
the
nights
what
shall
i
say
of
them
what
pen
can
describe
the
orgies
i
witnessed
during
those
dark
nights
and
who
can
believe
what
i
shall
have
to
say
about
them
though
i
will
not
and
can
not
say
the
half
of
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
i
got
from
the
rev
dunn
then
one
of
the
bishop
s
counselors
and
soon
after
vicar
general
the
statement
that
the
sum
of
was
expended
in
intoxicating
drinks
during
the
six
days
of
the
retreat
i
ought
to
say
during
the
five
nights
my
pen
refuses
to
write
what
my
eyes
saw
and
my
ears
heard
during
the
long
hours
of
those
nights
which
i
can
not
forget
though
i
should
live
a
thousand
years
the
drinking
used
to
begin
about
o
clock
as
soon
as
the
lights
were
put
out
some
were
handing
the
bottles
from
bed
to
bed
while
others
were
carrying
them
to
those
at
a
distance
at
first
with
the
least
noise
possible
but
half
an
hour
had
not
elapsed
before
the
alcohol
was
beginning
to
unloose
the
tongues
and
upset
the
brain
then
the
the
witty
stories
at
first
were
soon
followed
by
the
most
indecent
and
shameful
recitals
then
the
songs
followed
by
the
barking
of
dogs
the
croaking
of
frogs
the
howling
of
wolves
in
a
word
the
cries
of
all
kinds
of
beasts
often
mixed
with
the
most
lascivious
songs
the
most
infamous
anecdotes
flying
from
bed
to
bed
from
room
to
room
till
one
or
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
one
night
three
priests
were
taken
with
delirium
tremens
almost
at
the
same
time
one
cried
out
that
he
had
a
dozen
at
his
shirt
the
second
was
fighting
against
thousands
of
bats
which
were
trying
to
tear
his
eyes
from
their
sockets
and
the
third
with
a
stick
was
repulsing
millions
of
spiders
which
he
said
were
as
big
as
wild
turkeys
all
at
work
to
devour
him
the
cries
and
lamentations
of
those
three
priests
were
really
pitiful
to
those
cries
add
the
lamentations
of
some
dozen
of
them
whose
overloaded
stomachs
were
ejecting
in
the
beds
and
all
around
the
enormous
quantity
of
drink
they
had
swallowed
the
third
day
i
was
so
disgusted
and
indignant
that
i
determined
to
leave
without
noise
under
the
pretext
that
i
was
sick
it
was
not
a
false
pretext
for
i
was
really
sick
there
was
no
possibility
of
sleeping
before
two
or
three
o
clock
besides
the
stench
in
the
dormitories
was
horrible
there
was
however
another
thing
which
was
still
more
overwhelming
me
it
was
the
terrible
moral
struggle
in
my
soul
from
morning
till
night
and
from
night
till
morning
when
the
voice
of
conscience
which
i
had
to
take
for
the
voice
of
satan
was
crying
in
my
ears
oh
what
an
awful
thing
it
is
to
resist
the
voice
of
god
to
take
him
for
the
evil
one
when
by
his
warnings
he
seeks
to
save
your
soul
although
the
horrible
scandal
i
had
seen
distressed
me
more
than
human
words
can
tell
those
mental
conflicts
were
still
more
distressing
fearing
lest
i
should
entirely
lose
my
faith
in
my
religion
and
become
an
absolute
infidel
by
remaining
any
longer
in
the
midst
of
such
profligacy
i
determined
to
leave
but
before
doing
so
i
wanted
to
consult
the
new
friend
whom
the
providence
of
god
had
given
me
in
dunn
it
seemed
the
unbearable
burden
which
was
on
my
shoulders
would
become
lighter
by
sharing
it
with
such
a
sympathetic
brother
priest
i
went
to
him
after
dinner
and
taking
him
apart
i
told
him
all
about
the
orgies
of
last
night
and
asked
his
advice
on
my
determination
not
to
continue
that
retreat
which
was
evidently
nothing
else
than
a
blind
and
a
sacrilegious
comedy
to
deceive
the
world
he
answered
you
teach
me
nothing
for
i
spent
last
night
in
the
same
dormitory
where
you
were
one
of
the
priests
told
me
all
about
those
orgies
yesterday
i
could
hardly
believe
what
he
said
and
i
determined
to
see
and
hear
for
myself
what
was
going
on
you
do
not
exaggerate
you
do
not
even
mention
half
of
the
horrors
of
last
night
it
baffles
any
description
it
is
simply
incredible
for
any
one
who
has
not
himself
witnessed
them
however
i
do
not
advise
you
to
leave
it
would
forever
ruin
you
in
the
mind
of
the
bishop
who
is
not
already
too
well
disposed
in
your
favor
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
and
tell
everything
to
bishop
spaulding
i
have
done
it
this
morning
but
i
felt
that
he
did
not
believe
the
half
of
what
i
told
him
when
the
same
testimony
comes
from
you
then
he
will
believe
it
and
will
probably
take
some
measures
with
our
own
bishop
to
put
an
end
to
those
horrors
i
have
something
to
tell
you
confidentially
which
surpasses
in
a
measure
anything
you
know
of
the
abominations
of
these
last
three
nights
with
these
fine
words
ringing
in
my
ears
said
good
dunn
i
had
to
leave
his
room
at
the
double
quick
it
is
of
no
use
for
us
to
speak
to
bishop
o
regan
on
that
matter
it
will
do
no
good
he
wants
to
get
a
large
subscription
from
those
priests
at
the
end
of
the
retreat
and
he
is
rather
inclined
to
pet
than
punish
them
till
he
obtains
the
he
wants
to
build
his
white
marble
palace
on
the
lake
i
replied
though
you
add
to
my
desolation
instead
of
diminishing
it
by
what
you
say
of
the
strange
principles
of
our
bishop
i
will
speak
to
my
lord
spaulding
as
you
advise
without
a
moment
s
delay
i
went
to
his
room
he
received
me
very
kindly
and
did
not
at
all
seem
surprised
at
what
i
said
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
the
same
or
still
worse
abominations
however
when
i
told
him
the
enormous
quantity
of
liquor
drank
and
that
retreat
would
be
only
a
ridiculous
comedy
if
no
attempt
at
reform
was
tried
he
agreed
with
me
but
it
would
be
advisable
to
try
it
he
although
the
bishop
of
chicago
seemed
puzzled
at
seeing
me
entering
the
room
with
my
lord
spaulding
he
was
as
polite
as
possible
he
listened
with
more
attention
than
i
expected
to
the
narrative
i
gave
of
what
is
going
on
among
the
priests
after
telling
him
my
sad
story
bishop
spaulding
said
my
lord
of
chicago
these
facts
are
very
grave
and
there
can
not
be
any
doubt
about
the
truth
of
what
we
have
just
heard
two
other
gentlemen
gave
me
the
same
testimony
this
yes
said
bishop
o
regan
it
is
very
sad
to
see
that
our
priests
have
so
little
even
during
such
solemn
days
as
those
of
a
public
retreat
the
rev
dunn
has
just
told
me
the
same
sad
story
as
father
chiniquy
but
what
remedy
can
we
find
for
such
a
state
of
things
perhaps
it
might
do
well
to
give
them
a
good
sermon
on
temperance
chiniquy
i
am
told
that
you
are
called
the
temperance
apostle
of
and
that
you
are
a
powerful
speaker
on
that
subject
would
you
not
like
to
give
them
one
or
two
addresses
on
the
injury
they
are
doing
to
themselves
and
to
our
holy
church
by
their
drunkenness
if
those
priests
could
understand
me
in
french
i
replied
i
would
accept
the
honor
you
offer
me
with
pleasure
but
to
be
understood
by
them
i
would
have
to
speak
in
english
and
i
am
not
sufficiently
free
in
that
language
to
attempt
it
my
broken
english
would
only
bring
ridicule
upon
the
holy
cause
of
temperance
but
my
lord
spaulding
has
already
preached
on
that
subject
in
kentucky
and
an
address
from
his
lordship
would
be
listened
to
with
more
attention
and
benefit
from
him
than
from
it
was
then
agreed
that
he
should
change
his
programme
and
give
two
addresses
on
temperance
which
he
did
but
though
these
addresses
were
really
eloquent
they
were
pearls
thrown
before
swine
the
drunken
priests
slept
as
usual
and
even
snored
almost
through
the
whole
length
of
the
delivery
it
is
true
that
we
could
notice
a
little
improvement
and
less
noise
the
following
nights
the
change
however
was
very
little
the
fourth
day
of
the
retreat
the
rev
lebel
came
to
me
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
he
looked
furious
he
said
now
you
must
be
satisfied
i
am
interdicted
and
turned
out
ignominiously
from
this
diocese
it
is
your
work
but
mind
what
i
tell
you
you
will
also
soon
be
turned
out
from
your
colony
by
the
mitred
tyrant
who
has
just
struck
me
down
he
told
me
several
times
that
he
would
at
any
cost
break
your
plans
of
french
colonization
by
sending
you
to
the
of
illinois
along
the
mississippi
to
an
old
french
settlement
opposite
louis
he
is
enraged
against
you
for
your
refusing
to
give
him
your
fine
property
at
i
answered
him
you
are
mistaken
when
you
think
that
i
am
the
author
of
your
misfortunes
you
have
disgraced
yourself
by
your
own
acts
god
has
given
you
talents
and
qualities
which
if
cultivated
would
have
exalted
you
in
the
church
but
you
have
preferred
to
destroy
those
great
gifts
in
order
to
follow
the
evil
inclinations
of
your
poor
degraded
human
nature
you
reap
what
you
have
sown
nobody
is
more
sorry
than
i
am
for
your
misfortune
and
my
most
sincere
wish
is
that
the
past
may
be
a
lesson
to
guide
your
steps
in
the
future
the
desire
of
my
bishop
to
turn
me
out
of
my
colony
does
not
trouble
me
if
it
is
the
will
of
god
to
keep
me
at
the
head
of
that
great
work
the
bishop
of
chicago
will
go
down
from
his
episcopal
throne
before
i
go
down
the
beautiful
hill
of
anne
adieu
he
soon
disappeared
but
how
the
fall
of
this
priest
whom
i
had
so
sincerely
loved
saddened
me
the
next
sabbath
was
the
last
day
of
the
retreat
all
the
priests
went
in
procession
to
the
cathedral
to
receive
the
holy
communion
and
every
one
of
them
ate
what
we
had
to
believe
the
true
body
soul
and
divinity
of
jesus
christ
this
however
did
not
prevent
thirteen
of
them
from
spending
the
greater
part
of
the
next
night
in
the
calaboose
to
which
they
had
been
taken
by
the
police
from
houses
of
where
they
were
rioting
and
fighting
the
next
morning
they
were
discharged
from
the
hands
of
the
police
by
paying
pretty
round
sums
of
money
for
the
trouble
of
the
night
the
next
day
i
went
to
dunn
s
parsonage
to
ask
him
if
he
could
give
me
any
explanation
of
the
rumor
which
was
afloat
and
to
which
lebel
had
made
allusion
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
bishop
to
remove
me
from
my
colony
to
some
distant
part
of
his
diocese
it
is
unfortunately
too
true
said
he
bishop
o
regan
thinks
that
he
has
a
mission
from
heaven
to
undo
all
his
predecessor
has
done
and
as
one
of
the
best
and
grandest
schemes
of
bishop
vandevelde
was
to
secure
the
possession
of
this
magnificent
state
of
illinois
to
our
church
by
inducing
all
the
roman
catholic
emigrants
from
france
belgium
and
canada
to
settle
here
our
present
bishop
does
not
conceal
that
he
will
oppose
that
plan
by
removing
you
to
such
a
distance
that
your
colonization
plans
will
be
at
an
end
he
says
that
the
french
are
as
a
general
thing
rebels
and
disobedient
to
their
bishops
he
prefers
seeing
the
irish
coming
on
account
of
their
proverbial
docility
to
their
ecclesiastical
superiors
i
have
in
vain
tried
to
change
his
mind
i
told
you
before
that
he
often
asks
my
opinion
on
what
i
think
the
best
thing
to
be
done
for
the
good
of
the
diocese
but
i
do
not
think
that
he
intends
to
follow
my
advice
it
is
just
the
contrary
my
impression
now
is
that
he
wants
to
know
our
views
only
for
the
pleasure
of
acting
diametrically
in
opposition
to
what
we
i
must
not
omit
to
say
that
we
had
been
requested
to
spend
the
forenoon
of
monday
in
the
university
for
an
important
affair
which
the
bishop
had
to
propose
to
his
clergy
we
were
all
there
in
the
great
hall
at
the
appointed
hour
even
the
thirteen
priests
who
had
spent
the
best
part
of
the
night
at
the
police
station
heard
the
voice
of
their
bishop
and
they
were
there
as
docile
lambs
we
knew
beforehand
the
proposition
which
was
to
be
put
before
us
it
was
to
build
a
palace
for
our
bishop
worthy
of
the
great
illinois
state
the
cost
of
which
would
be
about
though
every
one
of
us
felt
that
this
was
most
extravagant
in
such
a
young
and
poor
diocese
nobody
dared
to
raise
his
voice
against
that
act
of
pride
and
supreme
folly
every
one
promised
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
raise
that
sum
and
to
show
our
good
will
we
raised
among
ourselves
at
once
which
we
gave
in
cash
or
in
promissory
notes
after
this
act
of
liberality
we
were
blessed
and
dismissed
by
our
bishop
i
was
but
a
few
steps
from
the
university
when
an
irish
priest
unknown
to
me
ran
after
me
to
say
my
lord
o
regan
wants
to
see
you
and
five
minutes
later
i
was
alone
with
my
bishop
who
without
any
preface
told
me
mr
chiniquy
i
hear
very
strange
and
damaging
things
about
you
from
every
quarter
but
the
worst
of
all
is
that
you
are
a
secret
protestant
emissary
that
instead
of
preaching
the
true
doctrines
of
our
holy
church
about
the
immaculate
conception
purgatory
the
respect
and
obedience
due
to
their
superiors
by
the
people
auricular
confession
you
spend
a
part
of
your
time
in
distributing
bibles
and
new
testaments
among
your
emigrants
i
want
to
know
from
your
own
lips
if
this
be
true
or
i
answered
a
part
of
what
the
people
told
you
about
the
matter
is
not
true
the
other
is
true
it
is
not
true
that
i
neglect
the
preaching
of
the
doctrines
of
our
holy
church
about
purgatory
immaculate
conception
of
mary
auricular
confession
or
the
respect
due
to
our
superiors
but
it
is
true
that
i
do
distribute
the
holy
bible
and
the
gospel
of
christ
among
my
and
instead
of
blushing
at
such
unpriestly
conduct
you
seem
to
be
proud
of
it
angrily
replied
the
bishop
i
do
not
understand
my
lord
why
a
priest
of
christ
could
blush
for
distributing
the
word
of
god
among
his
people
as
i
am
bound
to
preach
that
holy
word
it
is
not
only
my
right
but
my
duty
to
give
it
to
them
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
there
is
no
preaching
so
efficacious
and
powerful
as
the
preaching
of
god
himself
when
speaking
to
us
in
his
holy
this
is
sheer
protestantism
chiniquy
this
is
sheer
protestantism
he
answered
me
angrily
my
dear
bishop
i
answered
calmly
if
to
give
the
bible
to
the
people
and
invite
them
to
read
and
meditate
on
it
is
protestantism
our
holy
pope
pius
vi
was
a
good
protestant
for
in
his
letter
to
martini
which
is
probably
in
the
first
pages
of
the
beautiful
bible
i
see
on
your
lordship
s
table
he
not
only
blesses
him
for
having
translated
that
holy
book
into
italian
but
invites
the
people
to
read
the
bishop
assuming
an
air
of
supreme
contempt
replied
your
answer
shows
your
complete
ignorance
on
the
subject
on
which
you
speak
so
boldly
if
you
were
a
little
better
informed
on
that
grave
subject
you
would
know
that
the
translation
by
martini
which
the
pope
advised
the
italian
people
to
read
formed
a
work
of
big
volumes
in
folio
which
of
course
nobody
except
very
rich
and
idle
people
could
read
not
one
in
ten
thousand
italians
have
the
means
of
purchasing
such
a
voluminous
work
and
not
one
in
fifty
thousand
have
the
time
or
the
will
to
peruse
such
a
mass
of
endless
commentaries
the
pope
would
never
have
given
such
an
advice
to
read
a
bible
as
the
one
you
distribute
so
then
my
lord
do
you
positively
tell
me
that
the
pope
gave
permission
to
read
martini
s
translation
because
he
knew
that
the
people
could
never
get
it
on
account
of
its
enormous
size
and
price
and
do
you
assure
me
that
he
would
never
have
given
such
an
advice
had
the
same
people
been
able
to
purchase
and
read
that
holy
work
yes
sir
it
is
what
i
mean
answered
the
bishop
with
an
air
of
triumph
for
i
know
positively
that
this
is
the
i
replied
calmly
i
hope
your
lordship
is
unwillingly
mistaken
for
if
you
were
correct
the
stern
and
unflinching
principles
of
logic
would
force
me
to
think
and
say
that
that
pope
and
all
his
followers
were
deceivers
and
that
encyclical
a
public
fraud
in
his
own
hands
for
we
catholic
priests
make
use
of
it
all
over
the
world
and
reprint
it
at
the
head
of
our
own
bibles
to
make
the
people
both
protestants
and
catholics
believe
that
we
approve
of
their
reading
our
own
versions
of
that
holy
had
i
thrown
a
spark
of
fire
in
a
keg
of
powder
the
explosion
would
not
have
been
more
prompt
and
terrible
than
the
rage
of
that
prelate
pointing
his
finger
to
my
face
he
said
now
i
see
the
truth
of
what
i
have
been
told
that
you
are
a
disguised
protestant
since
the
very
day
you
were
ordained
a
priest
the
bible
the
bible
is
your
motto
for
you
the
bible
is
everything
and
the
holy
church
with
her
popes
and
bishops
nothing
what
an
insolent
i
dare
say
what
a
blasphemous
word
i
have
just
heard
from
you
you
dare
call
an
encyclical
letter
of
one
of
our
most
holy
popes
a
in
vain
i
tried
to
explain
he
would
not
listen
and
he
silenced
me
by
saying
if
our
holy
church
has
in
an
unfortunate
day
appointed
you
one
of
her
priests
in
my
diocese
it
was
to
preach
her
doctrines
and
not
to
distribute
the
bible
if
you
forget
that
i
will
make
you
remember
it
and
with
that
threat
on
my
head
as
a
damocles
sword
i
had
to
take
to
the
door
which
he
had
opened
without
any
thanks
be
to
god
this
first
persecution
and
these
outrages
i
received
for
my
dear
bible
s
sake
did
not
diminish
my
respect
for
god
s
holy
word
nor
my
confidence
in
it
on
the
contrary
on
reaching
home
i
took
it
fell
on
my
knees
and
pressing
it
to
my
heart
i
asked
my
heavenly
father
to
grant
me
the
favor
to
love
it
more
sincerely
and
follow
its
divine
teachings
with
more
fidelity
till
the
end

my
life

my

and
my
counselor
a
month
had
hardly
elapsed
since
the
ecclesiastical
retreat
when
all
the
cities
of
illinois
were
filled
by
the
most
strange
and
humiliating
clamors
against
our
bishop
from
chicago
to
cairo
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
go
to
a
single
town
without
having
from
the
most
respectable
people
or
reading
in
big
letters
in
some
of
the
most
influential
papers
that
bishop
o
regan
was
a
thief
or
a
simoniac
a
perjurer
or
even
something
worse
the
bitterest
complaints
were
crossing
each
other
over
the
breadth
and
length
of
illinois
from
almost
every
congregation
he
has
stolen
the
beautiful
and
costly
vestments
we
bought
for
our
church
cried
the
french
canadians
of
chicago
he
has
swindled
us
out
of
a
fine
lot
given
us
to
build
our
church
sold
it
for
and
pocketed
the
money
for
his
own
private
use
without
giving
us
any
notice
said
the
germans
his
thirst
for
money
is
so
great
said
the
whole
catholic
people
of
illinois
that
he
is
selling
even
the
bones
of
the
dead
to
fill
his
treasures
i
had
not
forgotten
the
bold
attempt
of
the
bishop
to
wrench
my
little
property
from
my
hands
at
his
first
visit
to
my
colony
the
highway
thief
who
puts
his
dagger
at
the
breast
of
the
traveler
threatening
to
take
away
his
life
if
he
does
not
give
him
his
purse
does
not
appear
more
infamous
to
his
victim
than
that
bishop
appeared
to
me
that
day
but
my
hope
then
was
that
this
was
an
isolated
and
exceptional
case
in
the
life
of
my
superior
and
i
did
not
whisper
a
word
of
it
to
anybody
i
began
to
think
differently
however
when
i
saw
the
numerous
articles
in
the
principal
papers
of
the
state
signed
by
the
most
respectable
names
accusing
him
of
theft
simony
and
lies
my
hope
at
first
was
that
there
were
many
exaggerations
in
those
reports
but
they
came
thicker
day
after
day
i
thought
my
duty
was
to
go
to
chicago
and
see
for
myself
to
what
extent
those
rumors
were
true
i
went
directly
to
the
french
canadian
church
and
to
my
unspeakable
dismay
i
found
that
it
was
too
true
that
the
bishop
had
stolen
the
fine
church
vestments
which
my
countrymen
had
bought
for
their
own
priest
for
grand
festivals
and
he
had
transferred
them
to
the
cathedral
of
mary
for
his
own
personal
use
the
indignation
of
my
poor
countrymen
knew
no
bounds
it
was
really
deplorable
to
hear
with
what
supreme
disgust
and
want
of
respect
they
were
speaking
of
their
bishop
unfortunately
the
germans
and
irish
people
were
still
ahead
of
them
in
their
unguarded
disrespectful
denunciations
several
spoke
of
prosecuting
him
before
the
civil
courts
to
force
him
to
disgorge
what
he
had
stolen
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
succeeded
in
preventing
some
of
them
from
mobbing
and
insulting
him
publicly
in
the
streets
or
even
in
his
own
palace
the
only
way
i
could
find
to
appease
them
was
to
promise
that
i
would
speak
to
his
lordship
and
tell
him
that
it
was
the
desire
of
my
countrymen
to
have
those
vestments
restored
to
them
the
second
thing
i
did
was
to
go
to
the
cemetery
and
see
for
myself
to
what
extent
it
was
true
or
not
that
our
bishop
was
selling
the
very
bones
of
his
diocesans
in
order
to
make
money
on
my
way
to
the
roman
catholic
graveyard
i
met
a
great
many
of
sand
which
i
was
told
by
the
carters
had
been
taken
from
the
cemetery
but
i
did
not
like
to
stop
them
till
i
was
at
the
very
door
of
the
consecrated
spot
there
i
found
three
carters
who
were
just
leaving
the
grounds
i
asked
and
obtained
from
them
the
permission
to
search
the
sand
which
they
carried
to
see
if
there
were
not
some
bones
i
could
not
find
any
in
the
first
cart
and
my
hope
was
that
it
would
be
the
same
in
the
two
others
but
to
my
horror
and
shame
i
found
the
inferior
jaw
of
a
child
in
the
second
and
part
of
the
bones
of
an
arm
and
almost
the
whole
foot
of
a
human
being
in
the
third
cart
i
politely
requested
the
carters
to
show
me
the
very
place
where
they
had
dug
that
sand
and
they
complied
with
my
prayer
to
my
unspeakable
regret
and
shame
i
found
that
the
bishop
had
told
an
unmitigated
falsehood
when
to
appease
the
public
indignation
against
his
sacrilegious
trade
he
had
published
that
he
was
selling
only
the
sand
which
was
outside
of
the
fence
on
the
very
border
of
the
lake
it
is
true
that
to
make
his
case
good
he
had
ordered
the
old
fence
to
be
taken
away
in
order
to
make
a
new
one
many
feet
inside
the
old
one
but
this
miserable
and
shameful
subterfuge
rendered
his
crime
still
greater
than
it
had
at
first
appeared
what
added
to
the
gravity
of
that
public
iniquity
is
that
the
bishop
of
chicago
had
received
that
piece
of
land
from
the
city
for
a
burial
ground
only
after
they
had
taken
a
solemn
oath
to
use
it
only
for
burying
the
dead
every
load
of
that
ground
sold
then
was
not
only
an
act
of
simony
but
the
breaking
of
a
solemn
oath
no
words
can
express
the
shame
i
felt
after
convincing
myself
of
the
correctness
of
what
the
press
of
chicago
and
of
the
whole
state
of
illinois
had
published
against
our
bishop
about
this
sacrilegious
traffic
slowly
retracing
my
steps
to
the
city
from
the
cemetery
i
went
directly
to
the
bishop
to
fulfil
the
promise
i
had
made
to
the
french
canadians
to
try
to
obtain
the
restoration
of
their
fine
vestments
but
i
was
not
long
with
him
without
seeing
that
i
would
gain
nothing
but
his
implacable
enmity
in
pleading
the
cause
of
my
poor
countrymen
however
i
thought
that
my
duty
was
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
open
the
eyes
of
my
bishop
to
the
pit
he
was
digging
for
himself
and
for
us
all
catholics
by
his
conduct
my
lord
i
said
i
will
not
surprise
your
lordship
when
i
tell
you
that
all
the
true
catholics
of
illinois
are
filled
with
sorrow
by
the
articles
they
find
every
day
in
the
press
against
their
yes
yes
he
abruptly
replied
the
good
catholics
must
be
sad
indeed
to
read
such
disgusting
diatribes
against
their
superior
and
i
presume
that
you
are
one
of
those
that
are
sorry
but
then
why
do
you
not
prevent
your
insolent
and
infidel
countrymen
from
writing
those
things
i
see
that
a
great
part
of
those
libels
are
signed
by
the
french
i
answered
it
is
to
try
as
much
as
it
is
in
my
power
to
put
an
end
to
those
scandals
that
i
am
in
chicago
my
very
well
very
well
he
replied
as
you
have
the
reputation
of
having
great
influence
over
your
countrymen
make
use
of
it
to
stop
them
in
their
rebellious
conduct
against
me
and
i
will
then
believe
that
you
are
a
good
i
answered
i
hope
that
i
will
succeed
in
what
your
lordship
wants
me
to
do
but
there
are
two
things
to
be
done
in
order
to
secure
my
what
are
they
quickly
asked
the
bishop
the
is
that
your
lordship
give
back
the
fine
church
vestments
which
you
have
taken
from
the
french
canadian
congregation
of
chicago
the
is
that
your
lordship
abstain
absolutely
from
this
day
to
sell
the
sand
of
the
burying
ground
which
covers
the
tombs
of
the
without
answering
a
word
the
bishop
struck
his
fist
violently
upon
the
table
and
crossed
the
room
at
a
quick
step
two
or
three
times
then
turning
towards
me
and
pointing
his
finger
to
my
face
he
exclaimed
in
an
indescribable
accent
of
rage
now
i
see
the
truth
of
what
spink
told
me
you
are
not
only
my
bitterest
enemy
but
you
are
at
the
of
my
enemies
you
take
sides
with
them
against
me
you
approve
of
their
libellous
writings
against
me
i
will
never
give
back
those
church
vestments
they
are
mine
as
the
french
canadian
church
is
mine
do
you
not
know
that
the
ground
on
which
the
churches
are
built
as
well
as
the
churches
themselves
and
all
that
belongs
to
the
church
belongs
to
the
bishop
was
it
not
a
burning
shame
to
use
those
fine
vestments
in
a
poor
miserable
church
of
chicago
when
the
bishop
of
that
important
city
was
covered
with
rags
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
episcopal
dignity
that
i
ordered
those
rich
and
splendid
vestments
which
were
mine
by
law
to
be
transferred
from
that
small
and
insignificant
congregation
to
my
cathedral
of
mary
and
if
you
had
an
ounce
of
respect
for
your
bishop
chiniquy
you
would
immediately
go
to
your
countrymen
and
put
a
stop
to
their
murmurs
and
slanders
against
me
by
simply
telling
them
that
i
have
taken
what
was
mine
from
that
church
which
is
mine
also
to
the
cathedral
which
is
altogether
mine
tell
your
countrymen
to
hold
their
tongues
and
respect
their
bishop
when
he
is
in
the
right
as
i
am
i
had
many
times
considered
the
infamy
and
injustice
of
the
law
which
the
bishops
have
had
passed
all
over
the
united
states
making
every
one
of
them
a
corporation
with
the
right
of
possessing
personally
all
the
church
properties
of
the
roman
catholics
but
i
had
never
understood
the
infamy
and
tyranny
of
that
law
so
clearly
as
in
that
hour
it
is
impossible
to
describe
with
ink
and
paper
the
air
of
pride
and
contempt
with
which
the
bishop
really
in
substance
if
not
in
words
told
me
all
those
things
are
mine
i
do
what
i
please
with
them
you
must
be
mute
and
silent
when
i
take
them
away
from
you
it
is
against
god
himself
that
you
rebel
when
you
refuse
me
the
right
of
dispossessing
you
of
all
those
properties
which
you
have
purchased
with
your
own
money
and
which
have
not
cost
me
a
cent
in
that
moment
i
felt
that
the
law
which
makes
every
bishop
the
only
master
and
proprietor
of
all
the
religious
goods
houses
churches
lands
and
money
of
their
people
as
catholics
is
simply
diabolical
and
that
the
church
which
sanctions
such
a
law
is
antichristian
though
it
was
at
the
risk
and
peril
of
every
thing
dear
to
me
that
i
should
openly
protest
against
that
unjust
law
there
was
no
help
i
felt
constrained
to
do
so
with
all
the
energy
i
possessed
i
answered
my
lord
i
confess
that
this
is
the
law
in
the
united
states
but
this
is
a
human
law
directly
opposed
to
the
gospel
i
do
not
find
a
single
word
in
the
gospel
which
gives
this
power
to
the
bishop
such
a
power
is
an
abusive
not
a
divine
power
which
will
sooner
or
later
destroy
our
holy
church
in
the
united
states
as
it
has
already
mortally
wounded
her
in
great
britain
in
france
and
in
many
other
places
when
christ
said
in
the
holy
gospel
that
he
had
not
enough
of
ground
whereon
to
lay
his
head
he
condemned
in
advance
the
pretensions
of
the
bishops
who
lay
their
hands
on
our
church
properties
as
their
own
such
a
claim
is
an
usurpation
and
not
a
right
my
lord
our
saviour
jesus
christ
protested
against
that
usurpation
when
asked
by
a
young
man
to
meddle
in
his
temporal
affairs
with
his
brothers
he
answered
that
he
had
not
received
such
the
gospel
is
a
long
protest
against
that
usurpation
in
every
page
it
tells
us
that
the
kingdom
of
christ
is
not
of
this
world
i
have
myself
given
to
help
my
countrymen
to
buy
those
church
vestments
they
belong
to
them
and
not
to
you
my
words
uttered
with
an
expression
of
firmness
which
the
bishop
had
never
yet
seen
in
any
of
his
priests
fell
upon
him
at
first
as
a
thunderbolt
they
so
puzzled
him
that
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
as
if
he
wanted
to
see
if
it
was
a
dream
or
a
reality
that
one
of
his
priests
had
the
audacity
to
use
such
language
in
his
presence
but
soon
recovering
from
his
stupor
he
interrupted
me
by
striking
his
fist
again
on
the
table
and
saying
in
anger
you
are
half
a
protestant
your
words
smell
protestantism
the
gospel
the
gospel
that
is
your
great
tower
of
strength
against
the
laws
and
regulations
of
our
holy
church
if
you
think
chiniquy
that
you
will
frighten
me
with
your
big
words
of
the
gospel
you
will
soon
see
your
mistake
at
your
own
expense
i
will
make
you
remember
that
it
is
you
must
obey
and
it
is
through
your
bishop
that
the
church
rules
you
my
lord
i
answered
i
want
to
obey
the
church
yes
but
it
is
a
church
founded
on
the
gospel
a
church
that
respects
and
follows
the
gospel
that
i
want
to
obey
these
words
threw
him
into
a
fit
of
rage
and
he
answered
i
am
too
busy
to
hear
your
impertinent
babblings
any
longer
please
let
me
alone
and
remember
that
you
will
soon
hear
from
me
again
if
you
can
not
teach
your
people
to
respect
and
obey
their
superiors
the
bishop
kept
his
promise
i
heard
of
him
very
soon
after
when
his
agent
peter
spink
dragged
me
again
a
prisoner
before
the
criminal
court
of
kankakee
accusing
me
falsely
of
crimes
which
his
malice
alone
could
have
invented
my
lord
o
regan
had
determined
to
interdict
me
but
not
being
able
to
find
any
cause
in
my
private
or
public
life
as
a
priest
to
found
such
a
sentence
he
had
pressed
that
land
speculator
spink
to
prosecute
me
again
promising
to
base
his
interdict
on
the
condemnation
which
he
had
been
told
would
be
passed
against
me
by
the
criminal
court
of
kankakee
but
the
bishop
and
peter
spink
were
again
to
be
disappointed
for
the
verdict
of
the
court
given
on
the
of
november
was
again
in
my
favor
my
heart
filled
with
joy
at
this
new
and
great
victory
my
god
had
given
me
against
my
merciless
persecutors
i
was
blessing
him
when
my
two
lawyers
osgood
and
padcock
came
to
me
and
said
our
victory
though
great
is
not
so
decisive
as
was
expected
for
spink
has
just
taken
an
oath
that
he
has
no
confidence
in
this
kankakee
court
and
he
has
appealed
by
a
change
of
venue
to
the
court
of
urbana
in
champaign
county
we
are
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
that
you
must
remain
a
prisoner
under
bail
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
who
is
bound
to
deliver
you
to
the
sheriff
of
urbana
the
of
may
next
i
nearly
fainted
when
i
heard
this
the
ignominy
of
being
again
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
for
so
long
a
time
the
enormous
expenses
far
beyond
my
means
to
bring
my
fifteen
to
twenty
witnesses
such
a
long
distance
of
nearly
one
hundred
miles
the
new
ocean
of
insults
false
accusations
and
perjuries
with
which
my
enemies
were
to
overwhelm
me
again
and
the
new
risk
of
being
condemned
though
innocent
at
that
distant
court
all
those
things
crowded
themselves
in
my
mind
to
crush
me
for
a
few
minutes
i
was
obliged
to
sit
down
for
i
would
have
surely
fallen
down
had
i
continued
to
stand
on
my
feet
a
kind
friend
had
to
bring
me
some
cold
water
and
bathe
my
forehead
to
prevent
me
from
fainting
it
seemed
that
god
had
forsaken
me
for
the
time
being
and
that
he
was
to
let
me
fall
powerless
into
the
hand
of
my
foes
but
i
was
mistaken
that
merciful
god
was
near
me
in
that
dark
hour
to
give
me
one
of
the
marvellous
proofs
of
his
paternal
and
loving
care
the
very
moment
i
was
leaving
the
court
with
a
heavy
heart
a
gentleman
a
stranger
came
to
me
and
said
i
answered
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
sympathetic
words
but
would
you
please
allow
me
to
ask
your
name
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
keep
my
incognito
here
he
answered
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
a
catholic
like
you
and
one
who
like
you
can
not
bear
any
longer
the
tyranny
of
our
american
bishops
with
many
others
i
look
to
you
as
our
deliverer
and
for
that
reason
i
advise
you
to
engage
the
services
of
abraham
but
i
replied
who
is
that
abraham
lincoln
i
never
heard
of
that
man
he
replied
abraham
lincoln
is
the
best
lawyer
and
the
most
honest
man
we
have
in
i
went
immediately
with
that
stranger
to
my
two
lawyers
who
were
in
consultation
only
a
few
steps
from
us
and
asked
them
if
they
would
have
any
objections
that
i
should
ask
the
services
of
abraham
lincoln
to
help
them
to
defend
me
at
urbana
they
both
answered
oh
if
you
can
secure
the
services
of
abraham
lincoln
by
all
means
do
it
we
know
him
well
he
is
one
of
the
best
lawyers
and
one
of
the
most
honest
men
we
have
in
our
without
losing
a
minute
i
went
to
the
telegraph
office
with
that
stranger
and
telegraphed
to
abraham
lincoln
to
ask
him
if
he
would
defend
my
honor
and
my
life
though
i
was
a
stranger
to
him
at
the
next
may
term
of
the
court
at
urbana
about
twenty
minutes
later
i
received
the
answer
yes
i
will
defend
your
honor
and
your
life
at
the
next
may
term
at
urbana
abraham
my
unknown
friend
then
paid
the
operator
pressed
my
hand
and
said
may
god
bless
and
help
you
father
chiniquy
continue
to
fight
fearlessly
for
truth
and
righteousness
against
our
mitred
tyrant
and
god
will
help
you
to
the
he
then
took
a
train
for
the
north
and
soon
disappeared
as
a
vision
from
heaven
i
have
not
seen
him
since
though
i
have
not
let
a
day
pass
without
asking
my
god
to
bless
him
a
few
minutes
later
spink
came
to
the
office
to
telegraph
to
lincoln
asking
his
services
at
the
next
may
term
of
the
court
at
urbana
but
it
was
too
late
before
being
dragged
to
urbana
i
had
to
renew
at
easter
the
oil
which
is
used
for
the
sick
in
the
ceremony
which
the
church
of
rome
calls
the
sacrament
of
extreme
unction
and
in
the
baptism
of
children
i
sent
my
little
silver
box
to
the
bishop
by
a
respectable
young
merchant
of
my
colony
called
dorion
but
he
brought
it
back
without
a
drop
of
oil
with
a
most
abusive
letter
from
the
bishop
because
i
had
not
sent
five
dollars
to
pay
for
the
oil
it
was
just
what
i
expected
i
knew
that
it
was
his
habit
to
make
his
priests
pay
five
dollars
for
that
oil
which
was
not
worth
more
than
two
or
three
cents
this
act
of
my
bishop
was
one
of
the
many
evident
cases
of
simony
of
which
he
was
guilty
every
day
i
took
his
letter
with
my
small
silver
box
to
the
archbishop
of
louis
my
lord
kenrick
before
whom
i
brought
my
complaints
against
the
bishop
of
chicago
on
the
of
april
that
high
dignitary
told
me
that
many
priests
of
the
diocese
of
chicago
had
already
brought
the
same
complaints
before
him
and
exposed
the
infamous
conduct
of
their
bishop
he
agreed
with
me
that
the
rapacity
of
bishop
o
regan
his
thefts
his
lies
his
acts
of
simony
were
public
and
intolerable
but
that
he
had
no
remedy
for
them
and
said
the
only
thing
i
advise
you
to
do
is
to
write
to
the
pope
directly
prove
your
charges
against
that
guilty
bishop
as
clearly
as
possible
i
will
myself
write
to
corroborate
all
you
have
told
me
for
i
know
it
is
true
my
hope
is
that
your
complaints
will
attract
the
attention
of
the
pope
he
will
probably
send
some
one
from
rome
to
make
an
inquiry
and
then
that
wicked
man
will
be
forced
to
offer
his
resignation
if
you
succeed
as
i
hope
in
your
praiseworthy
efforts
to
put
an
end
to
such
scandals
you
will
have
well
deserved
the
gratitude
of
the
whole
church
for
that
unprincipled
dignitary
is
the
cause
that
our
holy
religion
is
not
only
losing
her
prestige
in
the
united
states
but
is
becoming
an
object
of
contempt
those
public
crimes
are
i
was
however
forced
to
postpone
my
writing
to
the
pope
for
a
few
days
after
my
return
from
louis
to
my
colony
i
had
to
deliver
myself
again
into
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
of
kankakee
county
who
was
obliged
by
spink
to
take
me
prisoner
and
deliver
me
as
a
criminal
in
to
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
of
champaign
county
on
the
of
may
it
was
then
that
i
met
abraham
lincoln
for
the
first
time
he
was
a
giant
in
stature
but
i
found
him
still
more
a
giant
in
the
noble
qualities
of
his
mind
and
heart
it
was
impossible
to
converse
five
minutes
with
him
without
loving
him
there
was
such
an
expression
of
kindness
and
honesty
in
that
face
and
such
an
attractive
magnetism
in
the
man
that
after
a
few
moments
conversation
one
felt
as
tied
to
him
by
all
the
noblest
affections
of
the
heart
when
pressing
my
hand
he
told
me
you
were
mistaken
when
you
telegraphed
that
you
were
unknown
to
me
i
know
you
by
reputation
as
the
stern
opponent
of
tyranny
of
your
bishop
and
the
fearless
protector
of
your
countrymen
in
illinois
i
have
heard
much
of
you
from
two
priests
and
last
night
your
lawyers
osgood
paddock
acquainted
me
with
the
fact
that
your
bishop
employs
some
of
his
tools
to
get
rid
of
you
i
hope
it
will
be
an
easy
thing
to
defeat
his
projects
and
protect
you
against
his
he
then
asked
me
how
i
had
been
induced
to
desire
his
services
i
answered
by
giving
him
the
story
of
that
unknown
friend
who
had
advised
me
to
have
abraham
lincoln
for
one
of
my
lawyers
for
the
reason
that
he
was
the
best
lawyer
and
the
most
honest
man
in
he
smiled
at
my
answer
with
that
inimitable
and
unique
smile
which
we
may
call
the
lincoln
smile
and
replied
that
unknown
friend
would
surely
have
been
more
correct
had
he
told
you
that
abraham
lincoln
was
the
ugliest
lawyer
of
the
country
and
he
laughed
outright
i
spent
six
long
days
at
urbana
as
a
criminal
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
at
the
feet
of
my
judges
during
the
greatest
part
of
that
time
all
that
human
language
can
express
of
abuse
and
insult
was
heaped
on
my
poor
head
god
only
knows
what
i
suffered
in
those
days
but
i
was
providentially
surrounded
as
by
a
strong
wall
when
i
had
abraham
lincoln
for
my
defence
the
best
lawyer
and
the
most
honest
man
of
illinois
and
the
learned
and
upright
david
davis
for
my
judge
the
latter
became
of
the
united
states
in
and
the
former
its
most
honored
president
from
to
i
never
heard
anything
like
the
eloquence
of
abraham
lincoln
when
he
demolished
the
testimonies
of
the
two
perjured
priests
lebel
and
carthevel
who
with
ten
or
twelve
other
false
witnesses
had
sworn
against
me
i
would
have
surely
been
declared
innocent
after
that
eloquent
address
and
the
charge
of
the
learned
judge
davis
had
not
my
lawyers
by
a
sad
blunder
left
a
roman
catholic
on
the
jury
of
course
that
irish
roman
catholic
wanted
to
condemn
me
while
the
eleven
honest
and
intelligent
protestants
were
unanimous
in
voting
not
the
court
having
at
last
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
persuade
the
jury
to
give
a
unanimous
verdict
discharged
them
but
spink
again
forced
the
sheriff
to
keep
me
prisoner
by
obtaining
from
the
court
the
permission
to
begin
the
prosecution
at
the
term
of
the
fall
the
of
october
humanly
speaking
i
would
have
been
one
of
the
most
miserable
of
men
had
i
not
had
my
dear
bible
which
i
was
meditating
and
studying
day
and
night
in
those
dark
days
of
trial
but
though
i
was
then
still
in
the
desolate
wilderness
far
away
yet
from
the
promised
land
my
heavenly
father
never
forsook
me
he
many
times
let
the
sweet
manna
fall
from
heaven
to
feed
my
desponding
soul
and
cheer
my
fainting
heart
more
than
once
when
i
was
panting
with
spiritual
thirst
he
brought
me
near
the
rock
from
the
side
of
which
the
living
waters
were
gushing
to
refresh
and
renew
my
strength
and
courage
though
the
world
did
not
suspect
it
i
knew
from
the
beginning
that
all
my
tribulations
were
coming
from
my
unconquerable
attachment
and
my
unfaltering
love
and
respect
for
the
bible
as
the
root
and
source
of
every
truth
given
by
god
to
man
and
i
felt
assured
that
my
god
knew
it
also
that
assurance
supported
my
courage
in
the
conflict
every
day
my
bible
was
becoming
dearer
to
me
i
was
then
constantly
trying
to
walk
in
its
marvellous
light
and
divine
teaching
i
wanted
to
learn
my
duties
and
rights
i
like
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
the
bible
which
gave
me
the
power
and
wisdom
i
then
so
much
needed
to
fearlessly
face
so
many
foes
that
power
and
wisdom
i
felt
were
not
mine
on
this
very
account
my
dear
bible
enabled
me
to
remain
calm
in
the
very
lion
s
den
and
it
gave
me
from
the
very
beginning
of
that
terrible
conflict
the
assurance
of
a
final
victory
for
every
time
i
bathed
my
soul
in
its
divine
light
i
heard
my
merciful
heavenly
father
s
voice
saying
fear
not
for
i
am
with
chapter
lvii
bishop
o
regan
sells
the
parsonage
of
the
french
canadians
of
chicago
pockets
the
money
and
turns
them
out
when
they
come
to
determines
to
turn
me
out
of
my
colony
and
send
me
to
forgets
it
the
next
day
and
publishes
that
he
has
interdicted
people
send
a
deputation
to
the
sham
excommunication
by
three
drunken
priests
the
holy
scriptures
say
that
an
abyss
calls
for
another
abyss
abyssum
that
axiom
had
its
accomplishment
in
the
conduct
of
bishop
o
regan
when
once
on
the
declivity
of
iniquity
he
descended
to
its
lowest
depths
with
more
rapidity
than
a
stone
thrown
into
the
sea
not
satisfied
with
the
shameful
theft
of
the
rich
vestments
of
the
french
canadian
church
of
chicago
he
planned
iniquity
which
was
to
bring
upon
him
more
than
ever
the
execration
of
the
roman
catholics
of
illinois
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
complete
destruction
of
the
thriving
congregations
of
my
french
canadian
countrymen
of
chicago
and
anne
the
removal
of
the
priest
of
chicago
from
his
people
as
well
as
my
removal
from
my
colony
were
determined
our
churches
were
at
first
to
be
closed
and
after
some
time
sold
to
the
irish
people
or
to
the
highest
bidder
for
their
own
use
it
was
in
chicago
that
this
great
iniquity
was
to
begin
not
long
after
easter
the
rev
mons
lemaire
was
turned
out
interdicted
and
ignominiously
driven
from
the
diocese
of
chicago
without
even
giving
the
shadow
of
a
reason
and
the
french
canadians
suddenly
found
themselves
without
a
pastor
a
few
days
after
the
parsonage
they
had
built
for
their
priest
in
clark
street
was
sold
for
to
an
american
the
beautiful
little
church
which
they
had
built
on
the
lot
next
to
the
parsonage
at
the
cost
of
so
many
sacrifices
was
removed
five
or
six
blocks
southwest
and
rented
by
the
bishop
to
the
irish
catholics
for
about
per
annum
and
the
whole
money
was
pocketed
without
even
a
word
of
notice
to
my
countrymen
though
accustomed
to
his
acts
of
perfidy
i
could
not
believe
at
first
the
rumors
which
reached
me
of
those
transactions
they
seemed
to
be
beyond
the
limits
of
infamy
and
to
be
impossible
i
went
to
chicago
hoping
to
find
that
the
public
rumor
had
exaggerated
the
evil
but
alas
nothing
had
been
exaggerated
the
wolf
had
dispersed
the
sheep
and
destroyed
the
flock
the
once
thriving
french
congregation
of
chicago
was
no
more
wherever
i
went
i
saw
tears
of
distress
among
my
dear
countrymen
and
heard
cries
of
indignation
against
the
destroyer
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
among
them
with
one
voice
denounced
and
cursed
the
heartless
mitred
brigand
who
had
dared
to
commit
publicly
such
a
series
of
iniquities
to
satisfy
his
thirst
for
gold
and
his
hatred
of
the
french
canadians
they
asked
me
what
they
should
do
but
what
could
i
answer
they
requested
me
to
go
again
to
him
and
remonstrate
but
i
showed
them
that
after
my
complete
failure
when
i
had
tried
to
get
back
the
sacerdotal
vestments
there
was
no
hope
that
he
would
disgorge
the
house
and
the
church
the
only
thing
i
could
advise
them
was
to
select
five
or
six
of
the
most
influential
members
of
their
congregation
to
go
and
respectfully
ask
him
by
what
right
he
had
taken
away
not
only
their
priest
but
the
parsonage
and
the
church
they
had
built
and
transferred
them
to
another
people
they
followed
my
advice
franchere
and
roffinot
who
are
still
living
and
six
other
respectable
french
canadians
were
sent
by
the
whole
people
to
put
those
questions
to
their
bishop
he
answered
them
french
canadians
you
do
not
know
your
religion
were
you
a
little
better
acquainted
with
it
you
would
know
that
i
have
the
right
to
sell
your
churches
and
church
properties
pocket
the
money
and
go
eat
and
drink
it
where
i
after
that
answer
they
were
ignominiously
turned
out
from
his
presence
into
the
street
posterity
will
scarcely
believe
those
things
though
they
are
true
the
very
next
day
august
the
bishop
having
heard
that
i
was
in
chicago
sent
for
me
i
met
him
after
his
dinner
though
not
absolutely
drunk
i
found
him
full
of
wine
and
terribly
excited
mr
chiniquy
he
said
you
had
promised
me
to
make
use
of
your
influence
to
put
an
end
to
the
rebellious
conduct
of
your
countrymen
against
me
but
i
find
that
they
are
more
insolent
and
unmanageable
than
ever
and
my
firm
belief
is
that
it
is
your
fault
you
and
the
handful
of
french
canadians
of
chicago
give
me
more
trouble
than
all
of
my
priests
and
my
people
of
illinois
you
are
too
near
chicago
sir
your
influence
is
too
much
felt
on
your
people
here
i
must
remove
you
to
a
distant
place
where
you
will
have
enough
to
do
without
meddling
in
my
administration
i
want
your
service
to
kahokia
in
my
diocese
of
quincy
and
if
you
are
not
there
by
the
of
september
next
i
will
interdict
and
excommunicate
you
and
forever
put
an
end
to
your
these
words
fell
upon
me
as
a
thunderbolt
the
tyranny
of
the
bishop
of
my
church
and
the
absolute
degradation
of
the
priest
whose
honor
position
and
life
are
entirely
in
his
hands
had
never
been
revealed
to
me
so
vividly
as
in
that
hour
what
could
i
say
or
do
to
appease
that
mitred
despot
after
some
moments
of
silence
i
tried
to
make
some
respectful
remonstrances
by
telling
him
that
my
position
was
an
exceptional
one
that
i
had
not
come
to
illinois
as
his
other
priests
to
be
at
the
head
of
any
existing
congregation
but
that
i
had
been
invited
by
his
predecessor
to
direct
the
tide
of
emigration
of
the
people
of
europe
and
america
that
i
had
come
to
a
wilderness
which
by
the
blessing
of
god
i
had
changed
into
a
thriving
country
covered
with
an
industrious
and
religious
people
i
further
told
him
that
i
had
left
the
most
honorable
position
which
a
priest
had
ever
held
in
canada
with
the
promise
from
his
predecessor
that
as
long
as
i
lived
the
life
of
a
good
priest
i
should
not
be
disturbed
in
my
work
as
i
soon
perceived
that
he
was
too
much
under
the
influence
of
liquor
to
understand
me
and
speak
with
intelligence
i
only
added
my
lord
you
speak
of
interdict
and
excommunication
allow
me
to
respectfully
tell
you
that
if
you
can
show
me
that
i
have
done
anything
to
deserve
to
be
interdicted
or
excommunicated
i
will
submit
in
silence
to
your
sentence
but
before
you
pass
that
sentence
i
ask
you
in
the
name
of
god
to
make
a
public
inquest
about
me
and
have
my
accusers
confront
me
i
warn
your
lordship
that
if
you
interdict
or
excommunicate
mu
without
holding
an
inquest
i
will
make
use
of
all
the
means
which
our
holy
church
puts
in
the
hands
of
her
priests
to
defend
my
honor
and
prove
my
innocence
i
will
also
appeal
to
the
laws
of
our
great
republic
which
protects
the
character
of
all
her
citizens
against
anyone
who
slanders
them
it
will
then
be
at
your
risk
and
peril
that
you
will
pass
such
a
sentence
against
my
calm
answer
greatly
excited
his
rage
he
violently
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
and
said
i
do
not
care
a
straw
about
your
threats
i
repeat
it
chiniquy
if
you
are
not
at
kahokia
by
the
of
next
month
i
will
interdict
and
excommunicate
feeling
that
it
was
a
folly
on
my
part
to
argue
with
a
man
who
was
beside
himself
by
passion
and
excess
of
wine
i
replied
with
the
help
of
god
i
will
never
bear
the
infamy
of
an
interdict
or
excommunication
i
will
do
all
that
religion
and
honor
will
allow
me
to
prevent
such
a
dark
spot
from
defiling
my
name
and
the
man
who
does
try
it
will
learn
at
his
own
expense
that
i
am
not
only
a
priest
of
christ
but
also
an
american
citizen
i
respectfully
tell
your
lordship
that
i
neither
smoke
nor
use
intoxicating
drinks
the
time
which
your
other
priests
give
to
those
habits
i
spend
in
the
study
of
books
and
especially
of
my
bible
i
found
in
them
not
only
my
duties
but
my
rights
and
just
as
i
am
determined
with
the
help
of
god
to
perform
my
duties
i
will
stand
by
my
i
then
immediately
left
the
room
to
take
the
train
to
anne
having
spent
a
part
of
the
night
praying
god
to
change
the
heart
of
my
bishop
and
keep
me
in
the
midst
of
my
people
who
were
becoming
dearer
and
dearer
to
me
in
proportion
to
the
efforts
of
the
enemy
to
drive
me
away
from
them
i
addressed
the
following
letter
to
the
bishop
to
the
rt
rev
o
regan
bishop
of
chicago
my
lord
more
i
consider
your
design
to
turn
me
out
of
the
colony
which
i
have
founded
and
of
which
i
am
the
pastor
the
more
i
believe
it
a
duty
which
i
owe
to
myself
my
friends
and
to
my
countrymen
to
protest
before
god
and
man
against
what
you
intend
to
do
not
a
single
one
of
your
priests
stands
higher
than
i
do
in
the
public
mind
neither
is
more
loved
and
respected
by
his
people
than
i
am
i
defy
my
bitterest
enemies
to
prove
the
contrary
and
that
character
which
is
my
most
precious
treasure
you
intend
to
despoil
me
of
by
ignominiously
sending
me
away
from
among
my
people
certainly
i
have
enemies
and
i
am
proud
of
it
the
chief
ones
are
well
known
in
this
country
as
the
most
depraved
of
men
the
cordial
reception
they
say
they
have
received
from
you
has
not
taken
away
the
stains
they
have
on
their
foreheads
by
this
letter
i
again
request
you
to
make
a
public
and
most
minute
inquest
into
my
conduct
my
conscience
tells
me
that
nothing
can
be
found
against
me
such
a
public
and
fair
dealing
with
me
would
confound
my
accusers
but
i
speak
of
accusers
when
i
do
not
really
know
if
i
have
any
where
are
they
what
are
their
names
of
what
sin
do
they
accuse
me
all
these
questions
which
i
put
to
you
last
tuesday
were
left
unanswered
and
would
to
god
that
you
would
answer
them
by
giving
me
their
names
i
am
ready
to
meet
them
before
any
tribunal
before
you
strike
the
last
blow
on
the
victim
of
the
most
hellish
plot
i
request
you
in
the
name
of
god
to
give
a
moment
s
attention
to
the
following
consequences
of
my
removal
from
this
place
at
present
you
know
i
have
a
suit
with
spink
at
the
urbana
court
for
the
beginning
of
october
my
lawyers
and
witnesses
are
all
in
kankakee
and
iroquois
counties
and
in
the
very
time
i
want
most
to
be
here
to
prove
my
innocence
and
guard
my
honor
you
order
me
to
go
to
a
place
more
than
miles
distant
did
you
ever
realize
that
by
that
strange
conduct
you
help
spink
against
your
own
priest
when
at
kahokia
i
will
have
to
bear
the
heavy
expenses
of
traveling
more
than
miles
many
times
to
consult
my
friends
or
be
deprived
of
their
valuable
help
is
it
possible
that
you
thus
try
to
tie
my
hands
and
feet
and
deliver
me
into
the
hands
of
my
remorseless
enemies
since
the
beginning
of
that
suit
spink
proclaims
that
you
help
him
and
that
with
the
perjured
priests
you
have
promised
to
do
all
in
your
power
to
crush
me
down
for
the
sake
of
the
sacred
character
you
bear
do
not
show
so
publicly
that
spink
s
boastings
are
true
for
the
sake
of
your
high
position
in
the
church
do
not
so
publicly
lend
a
helping
hand
to
the
heartless
land
speculator
of
l
erable
he
has
already
betrayed
his
protestant
friends
to
get
a
wife
he
will
ere
long
betray
you
for
less
let
me
then
live
in
peace
here
till
that
suit
is
over
by
turning
me
away
from
my
settlement
you
destroy
it
more
than
of
the
emigrants
came
here
to
live
near
me
by
striking
me
you
strike
them
all
where
will
you
find
a
priest
who
will
love
that
people
so
much
as
to
give
them
every
year
from
one
to
two
thousand
dollars
as
i
have
invariably
done
it
is
at
the
price
of
those
sacrifices
that
with
the
poorest
class
of
emigrants
from
canada
i
have
founded
here
in
four
years
a
settlement
which
can
not
be
surpassed
or
even
equaled
in
the
united
states
for
its
progress
and
now
that
i
have
spent
my
last
cent
to
form
this
colony
you
turn
me
out
of
it
our
college
where
boys
are
receiving
such
a
good
education
will
be
closed
the
very
day
i
leave
for
you
know
very
well
the
teachers
i
got
from
montreal
will
leave
as
soon
as
i
will
ah
if
you
are
merciless
towards
the
priest
of
anne
have
pity
on
these
poor
children
i
would
rather
be
condemned
to
death
than
to
see
them
destroy
their
intelligence
by
running
in
the
streets
let
me
then
finish
my
work
here
and
give
me
time
to
strengthen
these
young
institutions
which
would
fall
to
the
ground
with
me
if
you
turn
me
out
or
interdict
me
as
you
say
you
will
do
if
i
disobey
your
orders
my
enemies
will
proclaim
that
you
treat
me
with
that
rigor
because
you
have
found
me
guilty
of
some
great
iniquity
and
this
necessarily
will
prejudice
my
judges
against
me
they
will
consider
me
as
a
vile
criminal
for
who
will
suppose
in
this
free
country
that
there
is
a
class
of
men
who
can
judge
a
man
and
condemn
him
as
our
bishop
of
chicago
is
doing
without
giving
him
the
names
of
his
accusers
or
telling
him
of
what
crimes
he
is
accused
in
the
name
of
god
i
again
ask
you
not
to
force
me
to
leave
my
colony
before
i
prove
my
innocence
and
the
iniquity
of
spink
to
the
honest
people
of
urbana
but
if
you
are
deaf
to
my
prayers
and
if
nothing
can
deter
you
from
your
resolution
i
do
not
wish
to
be
in
the
unenviable
position
of
an
interdicted
priest
among
my
countrymen
send
me
by
return
mail
my
letters
of
mission
for
the
new
places
you
intend
trusting
to
my
care
the
sooner
i
get
there
the
better
for
me
and
my
people
i
am
ready
when
on
the
road
of
exile
i
will
pray
the
god
of
abraham
to
give
me
the
fortitude
and
the
faith
he
gave
to
isaac
when
laying
his
head
on
the
altar
he
willingly
presented
his
throat
to
the
sword
i
will
pray
my
saviour
bearing
his
heavy
cross
to
the
top
of
calvary
to
direct
and
help
my
steps
towards
the
land
of
exile
you
have
prepared
for
your
devoted
priest
chiniquy
this
letter
was
not
yet
mailed
when
we
heard
that
the
drunkard
priests
around
us
were
publishing
that
the
bishop
had
interdicted
me
and
they
had
received
orders
from
him
to
take
charge
of
the
colony
of
anne
i
immediately
called
a
meeting
of
the
whole
people
and
told
them
the
bishop
has
not
interdicted
me
as
the
neighboring
priests
publish
he
has
only
threatened
to
do
so
if
i
do
not
leave
this
place
for
kahokia
by
the
of
next
month
but
though
he
has
not
interdicted
me
it
may
be
that
he
does
falsely
publish
that
he
has
done
it
we
can
expect
anything
from
the
destroyer
of
the
fine
congregation
of
the
french
canadians
of
chicago
he
wants
to
destroy
me
and
you
as
he
has
destroyed
them
but
before
he
immolates
us
i
hope
that
with
the
help
of
god
we
will
fight
as
christian
soldiers
for
our
life
and
we
will
use
all
the
means
which
the
laws
of
our
church
the
holy
word
of
god
and
the
glorious
constitution
of
the
united
states
allow
us
to
employ
against
our
merciless
tyrant
i
ask
you
as
a
favor
to
send
a
deputation
of
four
members
of
our
colony
in
whom
you
place
the
most
implicit
confidence
to
carry
this
letter
to
the
bishop
but
before
delivering
it
they
will
put
to
him
the
following
questions
the
answers
of
which
they
will
write
down
with
great
care
in
his
presence
and
deliver
them
to
us
faithfully
it
is
evident
that
we
are
now
entering
into
a
momentous
struggle
we
must
act
with
prudence
and
firmness
j
lemoine
leon
mailloux
francis
bechard
and
allaire
having
been
unanimously
chosen
for
that
important
mission
we
gave
them
the
following
questions
to
put
to
the
bishop
have
you
interdicted
chiniquy
why
have
you
interdicted
him
is
chiniquy
guilty
of
any
crime
to
deserve
to
be
interdicted
have
those
crimes
been
proved
against
him
in
a
canonical
way
why
do
you
take
chiniquy
away
from
us
our
deputies
came
back
from
chicago
with
the
following
report
and
answers
which
they
swore
to
some
time
after
before
the
kankakee
court
i
have
suspended
chiniquy
on
the
on
account
of
his
stubbornness
and
want
of
submission
to
my
orders
when
i
ordered
him
to
kahokia
if
chiniquy
has
said
mass
since
as
you
say
he
is
irregular
and
the
pope
alone
can
restore
him
in
his
ecclesiastical
and
sacerdotal
functions
i
take
him
away
from
anne
despite
his
prayers
and
yours
because
he
has
not
been
willing
to
live
in
peace
and
friendship
with
the
revs
lebel
and
cartevel
the
bishop
being
asked
if
those
two
priests
had
not
been
interdicted
by
him
for
public
scandals
was
forced
to
say
yes
my
second
reason
for
taking
chiniquy
from
anne
and
sending
him
to
his
new
mission
is
to
stop
the
spink
has
instituted
against
him
the
bishop
being
asked
if
he
would
promise
that
the
suit
would
be
stopped
by
the
removal
of
chiniquy
answered
i
can
not
promise
mr
chiniquy
is
one
of
the
best
priests
in
my
diocese
and
i
do
not
want
to
deprive
myself
of
his
services
no
accusation
against
his
morality
has
been
proved
before
me
mr
chiniquy
has
demanded
an
inquest
to
prove
his
innocence
against
certain
accusations
made
against
him
he
asked
me
the
names
of
his
accusers
to
confound
them
i
have
refused
to
grant
his
request
after
the
bishop
had
made
these
declarations
the
deputation
presented
him
the
letter
of
chiniquy
it
evidently
made
a
deep
impression
upon
him
as
soon

for
his

will
give

with

of

are
still
living
after
the
above
had
been
read
and
delivered
to
the
people
i
showed
them
the
evident
falsehood
and
contradictions
of
the
bishop
when
he
said
in
his
second
answer
if
chiniquy
said
mass
since
i
interdicted
him
he
is
irregular
and
the
pope
alone
can
restore
him
in
his
ecclesiastical
functions
and
then
in
the
seventh
tell
chiniquy
to
come
and
meet
me
to
prepare
for
his
new
mission
and
i
will
give
him
the
letters
he
wants
to
go
and

the
last
sentence
i
said
proves
that
he
knew
he
had
not
interdicted
me
as
he
said
at
first
for
had
he
done
so
he
could
not
give
me
letters
to
administer
the
sacraments
and
preach
at
kahokia
before
my
going
before
the
pope
who
alone
as
he
said
himself
could
give
me
such
powers
after
he
the
bishop
knew
that
i
had
said
mass
since
my
return
from
chicago
now
my
friends
here
is
the
laws
of
our
holy
church
not
the
saying
or
the
law
of
a
publicly
degraded
man
as
the
bishop
of
chicago
if
a
man
has
been
unjustly
condemned
let
him
pay
no
attention
to
the
unjust
sentence
let
him
even
do
nothing
to
have
that
unjust
sentence
of
the
by
gelase
pope
if
the
bishop
had
interdicted
me
on
the
his
sentence
would
be
unjust
for
from
his
own
lips
we
have
the
confession
that
no
accusation
has
ever
been
proved
before
him
that
i
am
one
of
his
best
priests
that
he
does
not
want
to
be
deprived
of
my
yes
such
a
sentence
if
passed
would
have
been
unjust
and
our
business
would
be
to
treat
it
with
the
contempt
it
would
deserve
but
that
unjust
sentence
has
not
even
been
pronounced
since
after
saying
mass
every
day
since
the
the
bishop
himself
wants
to
give
me
letters
to
go
to
kahokia
and
work
as
one
of
his
best
priests
it
strikes
me
for
the
first
time
that
it
is
more
your
destruction
as
a
people
than
mine
which
the
bishop
wants
to
accomplish
it
is
my
desire
to
remain
in
your
midst
to
defend
your
rights
as
catholics
if
you
are
true
to
me
as
i
will
be
to
you
in
the
impending
struggle
we
have
nothing
to
fear
for
our
holy
catholic
church
is
for
us
all
her
laws
and
canons
are
in
our
favor
the
gospel
of
christ
is
for
us
the
god
of
the
gospel
is
for
us
even
the
pope
to
whom
we
will
appeal
will
be
for
i
must
tell
you
a
thing
which
till
i
kept
secret
viz
the
archbishop
of
louis
to
whom
i
brought
my
complaint
in
april
last
advised
me
to
write
to
the
pope
and
tell
him
not
all
for
it
would
make
too
large
a
volume
but
something
of
the
criminal
deeds
of
the
roaring
lion
who
wants
to
devour
us
he
is
selling
the
bones
of
the
dead
which
are
resting
in
the
roman
catholic
cemetery
of
chicago
but
if
you
are
true
to
yourselves
as
catholics
and
americans
that
mitred
tyrant
will
not
sell
the
bones
of
our
friends
and
relatives
which
rest
here
in
our
burying
ground
he
has
sold
the
parsonage
and
the
church
which
our
dear
countrymen
had
built
in
chicago
those
properties
are
in
the
hands
of
the
irish
but
if
you
promise
to
stand
by
your
rights
as
christian
men
and
american
citizens
i
will
tell
that
avaricious
bishop
come
and
sell
our
parsonage
and
our
church
here
if
you
dare
as
i
told
you
before
we
have
a
glorious
battle
to
fight
it
is
the
battle
of
freedom
against
the
most
cruel
tyranny
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
is
the
battle
of
truth
against
falsehood
it
is
the
battle
of
the
old
gospel
of
christ
against
the
new
gospel
of
bishop
o
regan
let
us
be
true
to
ourselves
to
the
end
and
our
holy
church
which
that
bishop
dishonors
will
bless
us
our
saviour
jesus
christ
whose
gospel
is
despised
by
that
adventurer
will
be
for
us
and
give
us
a
glorious
victory
have
you
not
read
in
your
bibles
that
jesus
wanted
his
disciples
to
be
free
when
he
said
if
the
son
of
man
shall
make
you
free
you
shall
be
free
does
that
mean
that
the
son
of
god
wants
us
to
be
the
slaves
of
bishop
o
regan
no
cried
out
the
whole
people
may
god
bless
you
for
your
understanding
of
your
christian
rights
let
all
those
who
want
to
be
free
with
me
raise
their
hands
oh
blessed
be
the
lord
i
said
there
are
more
than
hands
raised
towards
heaven
to
say
that
you
want
to
be
free
now
let
those
who
do
not
want
to
defend
their
rights
as
christians
and
as
american
citizens
raise
their
hands
thanks
be
to
god
i
again
exclaimed
there
is
not
a
traitor
among
us
you
are
all
the
true
brave
and
noble
soldiers
of
liberty
truth
and
righteousness
may
the
lord
bless
you
all
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
before
dismissing
them
i
said
we
will
no
doubt
very
soon
witness
one
of
the
most
ludicrous
comedies
ever
played
on
this
continent
that
comedy
is
generally
called
excommunication
some
drunkard
priests
sent
by
the
drunkard
bishop
of
chicago
will
come
to
excommunicate
us
i
expect
their
visit
in
a
few
days
that
performance
will
be
worth
seeing
and
i
hope
that
you
will
see
and
hear
the
most
amusing
thing
in
your
i
was
not
mistaken
the
very
next
day
we
heard
that
the
of
september
had
been
chosen
by
the
bishop
to
excommunicate
us
i
said
to
the
people
when
you
see
the
flag
of
the
free
and
the
brave
floating
from
the
top
of
our
steeple
come
and
rally
around
that
emblem
of
there
were
more
than
people
on
our
beautiful
hill
when
the
priests
made
their
appearance
a
few
moments
before
i
had
said
to
that
immense
gathering
i
bless
god
that
you
are
so
many
to
witness
the
last
tyrannical
act
of
bishop
o
regan
but
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
it
is
that
no
insult
or
opposition
whatever
will
be
made
to
the
priests
who
come
to
play
that
comedy
please
do
not
say
an
angry
word
do
not
move
a
finger
against
the
performers
they
are
not
responsible
for
what
they
do
for
two
reasons
they
will
probably
be
drunk
the
priests
arrived
at
about
o
clock
and
never
such
shouting
and
clapping
of
hands
had
been
heard
in
our
colony
as
on
their
appearance
never
had
i
seen
my
dear
people
so
cheerful
and
as
when
one
of
the
priests
trembling
from
head
to
foot
with
terror
and
drunkenness
tried
to
read
the
following
sham
act
of
excommunication
which
he
nailed
on
the
door
of
the
chapel
the
reverend
monsieur
chiniquy
heretofore
curate
of
anne
colonie
of
beaver
in
the
diocese
of
chicago
has
formally
been
interdicted
by
me
for
canonical
causes
the
said
chiniquy
notwithstanding
that
interdict
has
maliciously
performed
the
functions
of
the
holy
ministry
in
administering
the
holy
sacraments
and
saying
mass
this
has
caused
him
to
be
irregular
and
in
direct
opposition
to
the
authority
of
the
church
consequently
he
is
a
schismatic
the
said
chiniquy
thus
named
by
my
letters
and
verbal
injunction
has
absolutely
persisted
in
violating
the
laws
of
the
church
and
disobeyed
her
authority
is
by
this
present
letter
excommunicated
i
forbid
any
catholic
having
any
communication
with
him
in
spiritual
matters
under
pain
of
excommunication
every
catholic
who
goes
against
this
defense
is
excommunicated
signed
anthony
bishop
of
chicago
and
administrator
of
quincy
as
soon
as
the
priests
who
had
nailed
this
document
to
the
door
of
our
chapel
had
gone
away
at
full
speed
i
went
to
see
it
and
found
what
i
had
expected
that
it
was
not
signed
by
the
bishop
neither
by
his
grand
vicar
nor
any
known
person
and
consequently
it
was
a
complete
nullity
according
to
the
laws
of
the
church
fearing
i
would
prosecute
him
as
i
threatened
he
shrank
from
the
responsibility
of
his
own
act
and
had
not
signed
it
he
was
probably
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
he
was
himself
excommunicated
for
not
having
signed
the
document
himself
or
by
his
known
deputies
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
got
a
boy
years
old
to
write
and
sign
it
in
this
way
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
bring
that
document
before
any
court
on
account
of
its
want
of
legal
and
necessary
forms
that
act
was
also
a
nullity
for
being
brought
by
three
priests
who
were
not
from
their
actual
state
of
drunkenness
and
again
it
was
a
nullity
from
the
evident
falsehood
which
was
its
base
it
is
alleged
that
the
bishop
had
interdicted
and
suspended
me
on
the
of
for
canonical
causes
but
he
had
declared
to
the
four
deputies
we
had
sent
him
that
chiniquy
was
one
of
my
best
priests
that
nothing
had
been
proved
against
him
consequently
no
canonical
cause
could
exist
for
the
allegation
the
people
understood
very
well
that
the
whole
affair
was
a
miserable
farce
designed
to
separate
them
from
their
pastor
it
had
just
by
the
good
providence
of
god
the
contrary
effect
they
had
never
shown
me
such
sincere
respect
and
devotedness
as
since
that
day
the
three
priests
after
leaving
entered
the
house
of
one
of
our
farmers
called
bellanger
a
short
distance
from
the
chapel
and
asked
permission
to
rest
a
while
but
after
sitting
and
smoking
a
few
minutes
they
all
went
out
to
the
stables
the
farmer
finding
this
very
strange
went
out
after
them
to
see
what
they
would
do
in
his
stables
to
his
great
surprise
and
disgust
he
found
them
drinking
the
last
of
their
whiskey
he
exclaimed
is
it
not
a
shame
to
see
three
priests
in
a
stable
drinking
rum
they
made
no
answer
but
went
immediately
to
their
carriage
and
drove
away
as
quickly
as
possible
singing
with
all
their
might
a
bacchanalian
song
such
was
the
last
act
of
that
excommunication
which
has
done
more
than
anything
else
to
prepare
my
people
and
myself
to
understand
that
the
church
of
rome
is
a
den
of
thieves
a
school
of
infidelity
and
the
very
antipodes

from

into
the
large
hall
of
the
of

to
hear
several
addresses
on
their

unanimously
passed
the

resolution
that
we
french
canadians
of
the
county
of

do
hereby
decide
to
give
our
moral
support
to

chiniquy
in
the
persecution
now
exerted
against
him
by
the
bishop

in
violation
of
the
laws

church
expressed
and
sanctioned
by

this
resolution
had
been

of

principal
members
of

parliament

who
was
then
a

city
presented
to
me
the
following
address
which
had
also
been
unanimously
voted
by
the
people
dear
and
beloved
pastor
several
years
we
have
been
witnesses
of
the
persecution
of
which
you
are
the
subject
on
the
part
of
the
bad
priests
your
neighbors
and
on
the
part
of
the
unworthy
bishop
of
chicago
but
we
also
have
been
the
witnesses
of
your
sacerdotal
your
forbearance
of
their
our
respect
and
affection
for
your
person
has
but
increased
at
the
sight
of
those
trials
we
know
that
you
are
persecuted
not
only
because
you
are
a
canadian
priest
and
that
you
like
us
but
also
because
you
do
us
good
in
making
a
sacrifice
of
your
own
private
fortune
to
build
and
to
feed
our
teachers
at
your
own
table
we
know
that
the
bishop
of
chicago
who
resembles
more
an
angry
wolf
than
a
pastor
of
the
church
having
destroyed
the
prosperous
congregation
of
chicago
by
taking
away
from
them
their
splendid
church
which
they
had
built
at
the
cost
of
many
sacrifices
and
giving
it
to
the
irish
population
and
having
discouraged
the
worthy
population
of
bourbonnais
grove
in
forcing
on
them
drunken
and
scandalous
priests
wants
to
take
you
away
from
among
us
to
please
spink
the
greatest
enemy
of
the
french
population
they
even
say
that
the
bishop
carrying
iniquity
to
its
extreme
bonds
wanted
to
interdict
you
but
as
our
church
can
not
and
is
not
willing
to
sanction
evil
and
calumny
we
know
that
all
those
interdicts
based
on
falsehood
and
spite
are
null
and
void
we
therefore
solicit
you
not
to
give
way
in
presence
of
the
perfidious
plots
of
your
enemies
and
not
to
leave
us
stay
among
us
as
our
pastor
and
our
father
and
we
solemnly
promise
to
sustain
you
in
all
your
hardships
to
the
end
and
to
defend
you
against
our
enemies
stay
among
us
to
instruct
us
in
our
duties
by
your
eloquent
speeches
and
to
enlighten
us
by
your
pious
examples
stay
among
us
to
guard
us
against
the
perfidious
designs
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
who
wants
to
discourage
and
destroy
our
prosperous
colony
as
he
has
already
discouraged
and
destroyed
other
congregations
of
the
french
canadians
by
leaving
them
without
a
pastor
or
by
forcing
on
them
unworthy
the
stern
and
unanimous
determination
of
my
countrymen
to
stand
by
me
in
the
impending
struggle
is
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
which
god
has
ever
given
me
it
filled
me
with
a
courage
which
nothing
could
hereafter
shake
but
the
people
of
anne
did
not
think
that
it
was
enough
to
show
to
the
bishop
that
nothing
could
ever
shake
the
resolution
they
had
taken
to
live
and
die
free
men
they
gathered
in
a
public
and
immense
meeting
on
the
sabbath
after
the
sham
excommunication
to
the
following
address
to
the
bishop
of
chicago
a
copy
of
which
was
sent
to
every
bishop
of
the
united
states
and
canada
and
to

to
his
lordship
anthony
o
regan
of
chicago
the
undersigned
inhabitants
of
the
parish
of
anne
beaver
settlement
seeing
with
sorrow
that
you
have
discarded
our
humble
request
which
we
have
sent
you
by
four
delegates
and
have
persisted
in
trying
to
drive
away
our
honest
and
worthy
priest
who
has
edified
us
in
all
circumstances
by
his
public
and
religious
conduct
and
having
contrary
to
the
rules
of
our
holy
church
and
common
sense
struck
our
worthy
pastor
chiniquy
with
excommunication
having
caused
him
to
be
announced
as
a
schismatic
priest
and
having
forbidden
us
to
communicate
with
him
in
religious
matters
are
hereby
protesting
against
the
unjust
and
iniquitous
manner
in
which
you
have
struck
him
refusing
him
the
privilege
of
justifying
himself
and
proving
his
innocence
consequently
we
declare
that
we
are
ready
at
all
times
as
good
catholics
to
obey
all
your
orders
and
ordinances
that
are
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
gospel
and
the
church
but
that
we
are
not
willing
to
follow
you
in
all
your
errors
of
judgments
in
your
injustices
and
covetous
caprices
telling
you
as
jerome
wrote
to
his
bishop
that
as
long
as
you
will
treat
us
as
your
children
we
will
obey
you
as
a
father
but
as
soon
as
you
will
treat
us
as
our
master
we
shall
cease
to
consider
you
as
our
father
considering
chiniquy
as
a
good
and
virtuous
priest
worthy
of
the
place
he
occupies
and
possessing
as
yet
all
his
sacerdotal
powers
in
spite
of
your
null
and
ridiculous
sentence
we
have
unanimously
decided
to
keep
him
among
us
as
our
pastor
therefore
praying
your
lordship
not
to
put
yourself
to
the
trouble
of
seeking
another
priest
for
us
more
yet
we
have
unanimously
decided
to
sustain
him
and
furnish
him
the
means
to
go
as
far
as
rome
if
he
can
not
have
justice
in
america
we
further
declare
that
it
has
been
dishonorable
and
shameful
for
our
bishop
and
for
our
holy
religion
to
have
seen
coming
under
the
walls
of
our
chapel
bringing
the
orders
of
the
prince
of
the
church
of
a
representative
of
christ
three
men
covered
with
their
sacerdotal
garments
having
their
tongues
half
paralyzed
by
the
effects
of
brandy
and
who
turning
their
backs
to
the
church
went
into
the
house
and
barn
of
one
of
our
settlers
and
there
emptied
their
bottles
and
from
there
taking
their
seats
in
their
buggies
went
towards
the
settlement
of
l
erable
singing
drunken
songs
and
hallooing
like
wild
indians
will
your
lordship
be
influenced
by
such
a
set
of
men
who
seem
to
have
for
their
mission
to
degrade
the
sacrados
and
catholicism
we
conclude
in
hoping
that
your
lordship
will
not
persist
in
your
decision
given
in
a
moment
of
madness
and
spite
that
you
will
reconsider
your
acts
and
that
you
will
retract
your
unjust
null
and
ridiculous
excommunication
and
by
these
means
avoid
the
scandal
of
which
your
precipitation
is
the
cause
we
then
hope
that
changing
your
determination
you
will
work
for
the
welfare
of
our
holy
religion
and
not
to
its
degradation
in
which
your
intolerant
conduct
would
lead
us
and
that
you
will
not
persist
in
trying
to
drive
our
worthy
pastor
rev
charles
chiniquy
from
the
flourishing
colony
that
he
has
founded
at
the
cost
of
the
abandonment
of
his
native
land
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
high
position
he
had
in
canada
that
you
will
bring
peace
between
you
and
us
and
that
we
shall
have
in
the
bishop
of
chicago
not
a
tyrant
but
a
father
and
that
you
will
have
in
us
not
rebels
but
faithful
children
by
our
virtues
and
our
good
example
subscribing
ourselves
the
obedient
children

fell
as

on
the
head
of
the
heartless
destroyer
of

people
but
it
did
not
change
his
destructive
plans
it
had
just
the
contrary
effect
as
a

mortally
wounded
by
the
sure
shots
of
the
hunters
he
filled
the
country
with
his
roaring
hoping
to
frighten

by
his
new
denunciations
he
published
the
most
lying
stories
to
explain
his
conduct
and
to
show
the
world
that
he
had
good
reasons
for
destroying
the
french
congregation
of
chicago
and
trying
the
same
experiment
on
anne
in
order
to
refute
his
false
statements
and
to
show
more
clearly
to
the
whole
world
the
reason
i
had
as
a
catholic
priest
to
resist
him
i
addressed
the
following
letter
to
his
lordship
anne
kankakee
county
september
rt
rev
d
o
regan
seem
to
be
surprised
that
i
have
offered
the
holy
sacrifice
of
mass
since
our
last
interview
here
are
some
of
my
reasons
for
so
doing
you
have
not
suspended
me
far
from
it
you
have
given
me
fifteen
days
to
consider
what
i
should
do
threatening
only
to
interdict
me
after
that
time
if
i
would
not
obey
your
orders
if
you
have
been
so
as
to
suspend
me
for
the
crime
of
telling
you
that
my
intention
was
to
live
the
live
of
a
retired
priest
in
my
little
colony
sooner
than
be
exiled
at
my
age
your
sentence
is
ridiculous
and
null
and
if
you
were
as
expert
in
the
as
in
the
art
of
pocketing
our
money
you
would
know
that
you
are
yourself
suspended
for
a
year
and
that
i
have
nothing
to
fear
or
to
expect
from
you
now
when
i
bowed
down
before
the
altar
of
jesus
christ
years
ago
to
receive
the
priesthood
my
intention
was
to
be
the
minister
of
the
catholic
church
but
not
a
slave
of
a
lawless
tyrant
remember
the
famous
words
of
tertullian
potestas
nulla
for
the
sake
of
peace
i
have
with
many
others
tolerated
your
despotism
till
now
but
my
patience
is
at
an
end
and
for
the
sake
of
our
holy
church
which
you
are
destroying
i
am
determined
with
many
to
oppose
an
insurmountable
wall
to
your
tyranny
i
did
not
come
here
you
know
well
as
an
ordinary
missionary
but
i
got
from
your
predecessor
the
permission
to
form
a
colony
of
my
emigrating
countrymen
i
was
not
sent
here
in
to
take
care
of
any
congregation
it
was
a
complete
wilderness
but
i
was
sent
to
form
a
colony
of
catholics
i
planted
my
cross
in
a
wilderness
in
a
great
part
with
my
own
money
i
have
built
a
chapel
a
college
and
a
female
academy
i
have
called
from
everywhere
my
of
them
came
here
only
to
live
with
me
and
because
i
had
the
pledged
word
of
my
bishop
to
do
that
work
and
as
long
as
i
live
the
life
of
a
good
priest
i
deny
you
the
right
to
forbid
me
to
remain
in
my
colony
which
wants
my
help
and
my
presence
you
have
never
shown
me
your
authority
but
once
except
in
the
most
tyrannical
way
but
now
seeing
that
the
more
humble
i
am
before
you
the
more
insolent
you
grow
i
have
taken
the
resolution
to
stand
by
my
rights
as
a
catholic
priest
and
as
an
american
citizen
you
remember
that
in
our
second
interview
you
forbade
me
to
have
the
good
preceptors
we
have
now
for
our
children
and
you
turned
into
ridicule
the
idea
i
had
to
call
them
from
canada
was
that
the
act
of
a
bishop
or
of
a
mean
despot
a
few
days
after
you
ordered
me
to
live
on
good
terms
with
lebelle
and
carthavel
though
you
were
well
acquainted
with
their
scandalous
lives
and
twice
you
threatened
me
with
suspension
for
refusing
to
become
a
friend
of
those
two
rogues
and
you
have
so
much
made
a
fool
of
yourself
before
the
four
gentlemen
i
sent
to
you
to
be
the
witnesses
of
your
iniquity
and
my
innocence
that
you
have
acknowledged
before
them
that
one
of
your
principal
reasons
for
turning
me
out
of
my
colony
was
that
i
had
not
been
able
to
keep
peace
with
three
priests
whom
you
acknowledged
to
be
depraved
and
unworthy
priests
is
not
that
surpassing
wickedness
and
tyranny
of
anything
recorded
in
the
blackest
pages
of
the
most
daring
tyrants
you
want
to
punish
by
exile
a
gentleman
and
a
good
priest
because
he
can
not
agree
to
become
the
friend
of
two
public
rogues
i
thank
you
bishop
o
regan
to
have
made
that
public
confession
in
the
presence
of
unimpeachable
witnesses
i
do
not
want
to
advise
you
to
be
hereafter
very
prudent
in
what
you
intend
to
do
against
the
reputation
and
character
of
the
priest
of
anne
if
you
continue
to
denounce
me
as
you
have
done
since
a
few
weeks
and
to
tell
the
people
what
you
think
fit
against
me
i
have
awful
things
to
publish
of
your
injustice
and
tyranny
as
judas
sold
our
saviour
to
his
enemies
so
you
have
sold
me
to
my
enemy
of
l
erable
but
be
certain
that
you
shall
not
deliver
up
your
victim
as
you
like
for
withdrawing
a
suit
which
you
have
incited
against
my
honor
and
which
you
shall
certainly
lose
you
drag
me
out
from
my
home
and
order
me
to
the
land
of
exile
and
you
cover
that
iniquity
with
the
appearance
of
zeal
for
the
public
peace
just
as
pilate
delivered
his
victim
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
to
make
peace
with
them
shame
on
you
bishop
o
regan
for
the
sake
of
god
do
not
oblige
me
to
reveal
to
the
world
what
i
know
against
you
do
not
oblige
me
in
to
strike
in
you
my
merciless
persecutor
if
you
have
no
pity
for
me
have
pity
on
yourself
and
on
the
church
which
that
coming
struggle
will
so
much
injure
it
is
not
enough
for
you
to
have
so
badly
treated
my
poor
countrymen
of
hatred
against
the
french
canadians
can
not
be
satisfied
except
when
you
have
taken
away
from
them
the
only
consolation
they
have
in
this
land
of
possess
in
their
midst
a
priest
of
their
own
nation
whom
they
love
and
respect
as
a
father
my
poor
countrymen
of
chicago
with
many
hard
sacrifices
had
built
a
fine
church
for
themselves
and
a
house
for
their
priest
have
taken
their
church
from
their
hands
and
given
it
to
the
you
have
sold
the
house
of
their
priests
after
turning
him
out
and
what
have
you
done
with
the
you
got
as
its
price
public
rumor
says
that
you
are
employing
that
money
to
support
the
most
unjust
and
infamous
suit
against
one
of
their
priests
continue
a
little
longer
and
you
may
be
sure
that
the
cursing
of
my
poor
countrymen
against
you
will
be
heard
in
heaven
and
that
the
god
of
justice
will
give
them
an
avenger
you
have
at
three
different
times
threatened
to
interdict
and
excommunicate
me
if
i
would
not
give
you
my
little
personal
properties
and
as
many
times
you
have
said
in
my
teeth
that
i
was
a
bad
priest
because
i
refused
to
act
according
to
your
rapacious
tyranny
the
impious
ahab
murdering
naboth
to
get
his
fields
is
risen
from
the
dead
in
your
person
you
can
not
kill
my
body
i
am
protected
by
the
glorious
flag
of
the
united
but
you
do
worse
you
try
to
destroy
my
honor
and
my
character
which
are
dearer
to
me
than
my
life
in
a
moral
way
you
give
my
blood
to
be
licked
by
your
dogs
but
remember
the
words
of
the
prophet
to
ahab
in
this
place
where
the
dogs
have
licked
the
blood
of
naboth
they
shall
lick
thy
blood
for
every
false
witness
you
shall
bring
against
me
i
shall
have
a
hundred
unimpeachable
ones
against
you
thousands
and
thousands
of
religious
irish
and
generous
germans
and
liberty
and
french
canadians
will
help
me
in
that
struggle
i
do
not
address
you
these
words
as
a
threat
but
as
a
friendly
warning
keep
quiet
my
lord
do
not
let
yourself
be
guided
by
your
quick
temper
do
not
be
so
free
in
the
use
of
suspense
and
interdicts
these
terrible
arms
are
swords
which
very
often
hurt
more
the
imprudent
who
make
use
of
them
than
those
whom
they
intend
to
strike
i
wish
to
live
in
peace
with
you
i
take
my
god
to
witness
that
to
this
day
i
have
done
everything
to
keep
peace
with
you
but
the
peace
i
want
is
the
peace
which
jerome
speaks
of
when
writing
to
his
bishop
he
tells
him
it
is
no
use
to
speak
of
peace
with
the
lips
if
we
destroy
it
with
our
works
it
is
a
very
different
way
to
work
for
peace
from
trying
to
submit
every
one
to
an
abject
slavery
we
also
want
peace
not
only
we
desire
it
but
we
implore
you
instantly
to
give
it
however
the
peace
we
want
is
the
peace
of
true
peace
a
peace
without
hatred
a
peace
which
is
not
a
masked
war
a
peace
which
is
not
to
crush
enemies
but
a
peace
which
unites
friends
how
can
we
call
that
peace
which
is
nothing
but
tyranny
why
should
we
not
call
everything
by
its
proper
name
let
us
call
is
hatred
and
let
us
say
that
peace
reigns
only
when
a
true
love
exists
we
are
not
the
authors
of
the
troubles
and
divisions
which
exist
in
the
church
a
father
must
love
his
children
a
bishop
as
well
as
a
father
must
wish
to
be
loved
but
not
feared
the
old
proverb
says
hates
whom
he
and
we
naturally
wish
for
the
death
of
the
one
we
hate
if
you
do
not
try
to
crush
the
religious
men
under
your
power
they
will
submit
themselves
to
your
authority
offer
them
the
kiss
of
love
and
peace
and
they
will
obey
you
but
liberty
refuses
to
yield
as
soon
as
you
try
to
crush
it
down
the
best
way
to
be
obeyed
by
a
free
man
is
not
to
deal
with
him
as
with
a
slave
we
know
the
laws
of
the
church
and
we
do
not
ignore
the
rights
which
belong
to
every
man
we
have
learned
many
things
not
only
from
experience
but
also
from
the
study
of
books
the
king
who
strikes
his
subjects
with
an
iron
rod
or
who
thinks
that
his
fingers
must
be
heavier
than
his
father
s
hand
has
soon
destroyed
the
kingdom
even
of
the
peaceful
and
mild
david
the
people
of
rome
refused
to
bear
the
yoke
of
their
proud
king
we
have
left
our
country
in
order
to
live
in
peace
in
this
solitude
our
intention
was
to
respect
the
authority
of
the
pontiffs
of
christ
we
mean
those
who
teach
the
true
faith
we
want
to
respect
them
not
as
our
masters
but
as
our
fathers
our
intention
was
to
respect
them
as
bishops
not
as
usurpers
and
tyrants
who
want
to
reduce
us
to
slavery
by
the
abuse
of
their
power
we
are
not
so
vain
as
to
ignore
what
is
due
to
the
priests
of
christ
for
to
receive
them
is
to
receive
the
very
one
whose
bishops
they
are
but
let
them
be
satisfied
with
the
respect
which
is
due
to
them
let
them
remember
that
they
are
fathers
not
masters
of
those
who
have
given
up
everything
in
order
to
enjoy
the
privileges
of
a
peaceful
solitude
may
christ
who
is
our
mighty
god
grant
that
we
should
be
united
not
by
a
false
peace
but
by
a
true
and
loyal
love
lest
that
by
biting
each
other
we
destroy
each
letter
of
jerome
to
his
bishop
you
have
a
great
opinion
of
the
episcopal
power
and
so
have
i
but
paul
and
all
the
holy
fathers
that
i
have
read
have
also
told
us
many
things
of
the
dignity
of
the
priest
alter
christus
sacerdos
i
am
your
brother
and
equal
in
many
things
do
not
forget
it
i
know
my
dignity
as
a
man
and
a
priest
and
i
shall
sooner
lose
my
life
than
to
surrender
them
to
any
man
even
a
bishop
if
you
think
you
can
deal
with
me
as
a
carter
with
his
horse
drawing
him
where
he
likes
you
will
soon
see
your
error
i
neither
drink
strong
wines
nor
smoke
and
the
many
hours
others
spend
in
emptying
their
bottles
and
smoking
their
i
read
my
dear
study
the
admirable
laws
of
the
church
and
the
gospel
of
christ
i
love
my
books
and
the
holy
laws
of
our
church
because
they
teach
me
my
rights
as
well
as
my
duties
they
tell
me
that
many
years
ago
a
general
council
which
is
something
above
you
has
annulled
your
unjust
sentence
and
brought
upon
your
head
the
very
penalty
you
intended
to
impose
upon
me
they
tell
me
that
any
sentence
from
you
coming
from
your
own
profession
from
bad
and
criminal
motives
is
null
and
will
fall
powerless
at
my
feet
but
i
tell
you
again
that
i
desire
to
live
in
peace
with
you
the
false
reports
of
lebelle
and
carthevel
have
disturbed
that
peace
but
it
is
still
in
your
power
to
have
it
for
yourself
and
give
it
to
me
i
am
sure
that
the
sentence
you
say
you
have
preferred
against
me
comes
from
a
misunderstanding
and
your
wisdom
and
charity
if
you
can
hear
their
voice
can
very
easily
set
everything
as
it
was
two
months
ago
it
is
still
in
your
power
to
have
a
warm
friend
or
an
immovable
adversary
in
kankakee
county
it
would
be
both
equitable
and
honorable
in
you
to
extinguish
the
fires
of
discord
which
you
have
so
unfortunately
enkindled
by
drawing
back
a
sentence
which
you
would
never
have
preferred
if
you
had
not
been
deceived
you
would
be
blessed
by
the
church
of
illinois
and
particularly
by
the
french
canadians
who
surround
me
and
are
ready
to
support
me
at
all
hazards
do
not
be
angry
from
the
seeming
harsh
words
which
you
find
in
this
letter
nobody
but
i
could
tell
you
these
sad
truths
though
every
one
of
your
priests
and
particularly
those
who
flatter
you
the
most
repeat
them
every
day
by
kind
and
honest
proceedings
you
can
get
everything
from
me
even
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
but
you
will
find
me
an
immovable
rock
if
you
approach
me
as
you
have
already
done
but
once
with
insult
and
tyrannical
threats
you
have
not
been
ordained
a
bishop
to
rule
over
us
according
to
your
fancy
but
you
have
the
eternal
laws
of
justice
and
equity
to
guide
you
you
have
the
laws
of
the
church
to
obey
as
well
as
her
humblest
child
and
as
soon
as
you
do
anything
against
these
imperishable
laws
you
are
powerless
to
obtain
your
object
it
is
not
only
lawful
but
a
duty
to
resist
you
when
you
strike
without
a
legitimate
or
a
canonical
cause
when
you
try
to
take
away
my
character
to
please
some
of
your
friends
when
you
order
me
to
exile
to
stop
a
suit
which
you
are
exciting
against
me
when
you
punish
me
for
the
crime
of
refusing
to
obey
the
orders
you
gave
me
to
be
the
friend
of
three
public
rogues
when
you
threaten
me
with
excommunication
because
i
do
not
give
you
my
little
personal
properties
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
your
interdicts
and
excommunication
what
a
sad
lot
for
me
and
what
a
shame
for
you
if
by
your
continual
attacks
at
the
door
of
our
churches
or
in
the
public
press
you
oblige
me
to
expose
your
injustice
it
is
yet
time
for
you
to
avoid
that
instead
of
striking
me
like
an
outcast
come
and
give
me
the
paternal
hand
of
charity
instead
of
continuing
that
fratricidal
combat
come
and
heal
the
wounds
you
have
made
and
already
received
instead
of
insulting
me
by
driving
me
away
from
my
colony
to
the
land
of
exile
come
and
bless
the
great
work
i
have
begun
here
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
my
people
instead
of
destroying
the
college
and
the
female
academy
for
the
erection
of
which
i
have
expended
my
last
cent
and
whose
teachers
are
fed
at
my
table
come
and
bless
the
three
hundred
little
children
who
are
daily
attending
our
schools
instead
of
sacrificing
me
to
the
hatred
of
my
enemies
come
and
strengthen
my
heart
against
their
fury
i
tell
you
again
that
no
consideration
whatever
will
induce
me
to
surrender
my
right
as
a
catholic
priest
as
an
american
by
the
first
title
you
can
not
interdict
me
as
long
as
i
am
a
good
priest
for
the
crime
of
wishing
to
live
in
my
colony
and
among
my
people
the
second
title
you
can
not
turn
me
out
from
my
c
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
roman
catholic
priest
with
his
whole
people
had
dared
to
speak
such
language
to
a
bishop
of
rome
on
this
continent
never
yet
had
the
unbearable
tyranny
of
those
haughty
men
received
such
a
public
rebuke
our
fearless
words
fell
as
a
bombshell
in
the
camp
of
the
roman
catholic
hierarchy
of
america
with
very
few
exceptions
the
press
of
the
state
of
illinois
whose
columns
had
so
often
echoed
the
cries
of
indignation
raised
everywhere
against
the
tyranny
of
bishop
o
regan
took
sides
with
me
hundreds
of
priests
not
only
from
illinois
but
from
every
corner
of
the
united
states
addressed
their
warmest
thanks
to
me
for
the
stand
i
had
taken
and
asked
me
in
the
name
of
god
and
for
the
honor
of
the
church
not
to
yield
an
inch
of
my
rights
many
promised
to
support
us
at
the
court
of
rome
by
writing
themselves
to
the
pope
to
denounce
not
only
the
bishop
of
illinois
but
several
others
who
though
not
so
openly
bad
were
yet
trampling
under
their
feet
the
most
sacred
rights
of
the
priests
and
the
people
unfortunately
those
priests
gave
me
a
saddening
knowledge
of
their
cowardice
by
putting
in
their
letters
they
all
promised
to
help
me
when
i
was
storming
the
strong
fortress
of
the
enemy
provided
i
would
go
alone
in
the
gap
and
that
they
would
keep
themselves
behind
thick
walls
far
from
shot
and
shell
however
this
did
not
disturb
me
for
my
god
knows
it
my
trust
was
not
in
my
own
strength
but
in
his
protection
i
was
sure
that
i
was
in
the
right
that
the
gospel
of
christ
was
on
my
side
that
all
the
canons
and
laws
of
the
councils
were
in
my
favor
my
library
was
filled
with
the
best
books
on
the
canons
and
laws
passed
in
the
great
councils
of
my
church
it
was
written
in
big
letters
in
the
celebrated
work
du
droit
there
is
no
arbitrary
power
in
the
church
of
christ
page
the
council
of
augsburg
held
in
can
had
declared
that
no
sentence
of
excommunication
will
be
passed
except
for
great
the
pope
gregory
had
said
that
censures
are
null
when
not
inflicted
for
great
sins
or
for
faults
which
have
not
been
clearly
an
unjust
excommunication
does
not
bind
before
god
those
against
whom
it
has
been
hushed
but
it
injures
only
the
one
who
has
proffered
laws
by
hericourt
c
no
if
an
unjust
sentence
is
pronounced
against
any
one
he
must
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
for
before
god
and
his
church
an
unjust
sentence
can
not
injure
anybody
let
then
that
person
do
nothing
to
get
such
an
unjust
sentence
repealed
for
it
can
not
injure
bin
the
canonists
conclude
from
all
the
laws
of
the
church
on
that
matter
that
if
a
priest
is
unjustly
interdicted
or
excommunicated
he
may
continue
to
officiate
without
any
fear
of
becoming
laws
by
hericourt
c
no
protected
by
these
laws
and
hundreds
of
others
too
long
to
enumerate
which
my
church
had
passed
in
every
age
strengthened
by
the
voice
of
my
conscience
which
assured
me
that
i
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
to
be
interdicted
or
excommunicated
sure
besides
of
the
testimony
brought
by
our
four
delegates
that
the
bishop
himself
had
declared
that
i
was
one
of
his
best
priests
that
he
wanted
to
give
me
my
letters
to
go
and
perform
the
functions
of
my
ministry
in
kahokia
above
all
knowing
the
unanimous
will
of
my
people
that
i
should
remain
with
them
and
continue
the
great
and
good
work
so
providentially
trusted
to
me
in
my
colony
and
regarding
this
as
an
indication
of
the
divine
will
i
determined
to
remain
in
spite
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
all
the
councils
of
my
church
were
telling
me
that
he
had
no
power
to
injure
me
and
that
all
his
official
acts
were
null
but
if
he
were
spiritually
powerless
against
me
it
was
not
so
in
temporal
matters
his
power
and
his
desire
to
injure
us
had
increased
with
his
hatred
since
he
had
read
our
letters
and
seen
them
in
all
the
papers
of
chicago
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
priest
lebelle
whom
he
had
turned
out
ignominiously
from
his
diocese
some
time
before
that
priest
had
since
that
obtained
a
fine
situation
in
the
diocese
of
michigan
he
invited
him
to
his
palace
and
petted
him
several
days
i
felt
that
the
reconciliation
of
those
two
men
meant
nothing
good
for
me
but
my
hope
was
more
than
ever
that
the
merciful
god
who
had
protected
me
so
many
times
against
them
would
save
me
again
from
their
machinations
the
air
was
however
filled
with
the
strangest
rumors
against
me
it
was
said
everywhere
that
lebelle
was
to
bring
such
charges
against
my
character
that
i
would
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
what
were
the
new
iniquities
to
be
laid
to
my
charge
no
one
could
tell
but
the
few
partisans
and
friends
of
the
bishop
lebelle
and
spink
were
jubilant
and
sure
that
i
was
to
be
forever
destroyed
at
last
the
time
arrived
when
the
sheriff
of
kankakee
had
to
drag
me
again
as
a
criminal
and
a
prisoner
to
urbana
and
deliver
me
into
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
of
that
city
i
arrived
here
on
the
of
october
with
my
lawyers
osgood
and
paddock
and
a
dozen
witnesses
abraham
lincoln
had
preceded
me
only
by
a
few
minutes
from
springfield
he
was
in
the
company
of
judge
david
davis
since
of
the
united
states
when
i
met
him
the
jury
having
been
selected
and
sworn
the
rev
lebelle
was
the
first
witness
called
to
testify
and
say
what
he
knew
against
my
character
lincoln
objected
to
that
kind
of
testimony
and
tried
to
prove
that
spink
had
no
right
to
bring
his
new
suit
against
me
by
attacking
my
character
but
judge
davis
ruled
that
the
prosecution
had
that
right
in
the
case
that
was
before
him
lebelle
had
then
full
liberty
to
say
anything
he
wanted
and
he
availed
himself
of
his
privilege
his
testimony
lasted
nearly
an
hour
and
was
too
long
to
be
given
here
i
will
only
say
that
he
began
by
declaring
that
chiniquy
was
one
of
the
vilest
men
of
the
every
kind
of
bad
rumors
were
constantly
circulating
against
he
gave
a
good
number
of
those
rumors
though
he
could
not
positively
swear
if
they
were
founded
on
truth
or
not
for
he
had
not
investigated
them
but
he
said
there
was
one
of
which
he
was
sure
for
he
had
authenticated
it
thoroughly
he
expressed
a
great
deal
of
apparent
regret
that
he
was
forced
to
reveal
to
the
world
such
things
which
were
not
only
against
the
honor
of
chiniquy
but
to
some
extent
involved
the
good
name
of
a
dear
sister
madame
bosse
but
as
he
was
to
speak
the
truth
before
god
he
could
not
help
sad
truth
must
be
told
he
said
attempted
to
do
the
most
infamous
things
with
my
own
sister
madame
she
herself
has
told
me
the
whole
story
under
oath
and
she
would
be
here
to
unmask
the
wicked
man
before
the
whole
world
if
she
were
not
forced
to
silence
at
home
from
a
severe
though
every
word
of
that
story
was
a
perjury
there
was
such
a
color
of
truth
and
sincerity
in
my
accuser
that
his
testimony
fell
upon
me
and
my
lawyers
and
all
my
friends
as
a
thunderbolt
a
man
who
has
never
heard
such
a
calumny
brought
against
him
before
a
jury
in
a
packed
with
people
composed
of
friends
and
foes
will
never
understand
what
i
felt
in
this
the
darkest
hour
of
my
life
my
god
only
knows
the
weight
and
the
bitterness
of
the
waves
of
desolation
which
then
passed
over
my
soul
after
that
testimony
was
given
there
was
a
lull
and
a
most
profound
silence
in
the
all
the
eyes
were
turned
upon
me
and
i
heard
many
voices
speaking
of
me
whispering
the
villain
those
voices
passed
through
my
soul
as
poisoned
arrows
though
innocent
i
wished
that
the
ground
would
open
under
my
feet
and
bring
me
down
to
the
darkest
abysses
to
conceal
me
from
the
eyes
of
my
friends
and
the
whole
world
however
lincoln
soon
interrupted
the
silence
by
addressing
to
lebelle
such
that
his
testimony
in
the
minds
of
many
soon
lost
much
of
its
power
and
he
did
still
more
destroy
the
effect
of
his
lebelle
s
false
oath
when
he
brought
my
twelve
witnesses
who
were
among
the
most
respectable
citizens
of
bourbonnais
formerly
the
parishioners
of
lebelle
those
twelve
gentlemen
swore
that
lebelle
was
such
a
drunkard
and
vicious
man
that
he
was
so
publicly
my
enemy
on
account
of
the
many
rebukes
i
had
given
to
his
private
and
public
vices
that
they
would
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
said
even
upon
his
oath
at
ten
the
court
was
adjourned
to
meet
again
the
next
morning
and
i
went
to
the
room
of
lincoln
with
my
two
other
lawyers
to
confer
about
the
morning
s
work
my
mind
was
unspeakably
sad
life
had
never
been
such
a
burden
to
me
as
in
that
hour
i
was
tempted
like
job
to
curse
the
hour
when
i
was
born
i
could
see
in
the
faces
of
my
lawyers
though
they
tried
to
conceal
it
that
they
were
also
full
of
anxiety
my
dear
chiniquy
said
lincoln
though
i
hope
to
destroy
the
testimony
of
lebelle
against
you
i
must
concede
that
i
see
great
dangers
ahead
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
in
my
mind
that
every
word
he
has
said
is
a
sworn
lie
but
my
fear
is
that
the
jury
thinks
differently
i
am
a
pretty
good
judge
in
these
matters
i
feel
that
our
jurymen
think
that
you
are
guilty
there
is
only
one
way
to
perfectly
destroy
the
power
of
a
false
is
by
another
direct
testimony
against
what
he
has
said
or
by
showing
from
his
very
lips
that
he
has
perjured
himself
i
failed
to
do
that
last
night
though
i
have
diminished
to
a
great
extent
the
force
of
his
testimony
can
you
not
prove
an
alibi
or
can
you
not
bring
witnesses
who
were
there
in
the
same
house
that
day
who
would
flatly
and
directly
contradict
what
your
remorseless
enemy
has
said
against
you
i
answered
him
how
can
i
try
to
do
such
a
thing
when
they
have
been
shrewd
enough
not
to
fix
the
very
date
of
the
alleged
crime
against
me
you
are
correct
you
are
perfectly
correct
chiniquy
answered
lincoln
as
they
have
refused
to
specify
the
date
we
can
not
try
that
i
have
never
seen
two
such
skillful
rogues
as
those
two
priests
there
is
really
a
diabolical
skill
in
the
plan
they
have
concocted
for
your
destruction
it
is
evident
that
the
bishop
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
plot
you
remember
how
i
have
forced
lebelle
to
confess
that
he
was
now
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
the
bishop
of
chicago
since
he
has
become
the
chief
of
your
accusers
though
i
do
not
give
up
the
hope
of
rescuing
you
from
the
hands
of
your
enemies
i
do
not
like
to
conceal
from
you
that
i
have
several
reasons
to
fear
that
you
will
be
declared
guilty
and
condemned
to
a
heavy
penalty
or
to
the
penitentiary
though
i
am
sure
you
are
perfectly
innocent
it
is
very
probable
that
we
will
have
to
confront
that
sister
of
lebelle
tomorrow
her
sickness
is
probably
a
feint
in
order
not
to
appear
here
except
after
the
brother
will
have
prepared
the
public
mind
in
her
favor
at
all
events
if
she
does
not
come
they
will
send
some
justice
of
the
peace
to
get
her
sworn
testimony
which
will
be
more
difficult
to
rebut
than
her
own
verbal
declarations
that
woman
is
evidently
in
the
hands
of
the
bishop
and
her
brother
priest
ready
to
swear
anything
they
order
her
and
i
know
nothing
so
difficult
as
to
refute
such
female
testimonies
particularly
when
they
are
absent
from
the
court
the
only
way
to
be
sure
of
a
favorable
verdict
is
that
god
almighty
would
take
our
part
and
show
your
innocence
go
to
him
and
pray
for
he
alone
can
save
lincoln
was
exceedingly
solemn
when
he
addressed
those
words
to
me
and
they
went
very
deep
into
my
soul
i
have
often
been
asked
if
abraham
lincoln
had
any
religion
but
i
have
never
had
any
doubt
about
his
profound
confidence
in
god
since
i
heard
those
words
falling
from
his
lips
in
that
hour
of
anxiety
i
had
not
been
able
to
conceal
my
deep
distress
burning
tears
were
rolling
on
my
cheeks
when
he
was
speaking
and
there
was
on
his
face
the
expression
of
friendly
sympathy
which
i
shall
never
forget
without
being
able
to
say
a
word
i
left
him
to
go
to
my
little
room
it
was
nearly
eleven
o
clock
i
locked
the
door
and
fell
on
my
knees
to
pray
but
i
was
unable
to
say
a
single
word
the
horrible
sworn
calumnies
thrown
at
my
face
by
a
priest
of
my
own
church
were
ringing
in
my
ears
my
honor
and
my
good
name
so
cruelly
and
forever
destroyed
all
my
friends
and
my
dear
people
covered
with
an
eternal
confusion
and
more
than
that
the
sentence
of
condemnation
which
was
probably
to
be
hurled
against
me
the
next
day
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
country
whose
eyes
were
upon
me
all
those
things
were
before
me
not
only
as
horrible
phantoms
but
as
heavy
mountains
under
the
burdens
of
which
i
could
not
breathe
at
last
the
fountains
of
tears
were
opened
and
it
relieved
me
to
weep
i
could
then
speak
and
cry
oh
my
god
have
mercy
upon
me
thou
knowest
my
innocence
hast
thou
not
promised
that
those
who
trust
in
thee
can
not
perish
oh
do
not
let
me
perish
when
thou
art
the
only
one
in
whom
i
trust
come
to
my
help
save
me
from
eleven
to
three
in
the
morning
i
cried
to
god
and
raised
my
supplicating
hands
to
his
throne
of
mercy
but
i
confess
to
my
confusion
it
seemed
to
me
in
certain
moments
that
it
was
useless
to
pray
and
to
cry
for
though
innocent
i
was
doomed
to
perish
i
was
in
the
hands
of
my
enemies
my
god
had
forsaken
me
what
an
awful
night
i
spent
i
hope
none
of
my
readers
will
ever
know
by
their
own
experience
the
agony
of
spirit
i
endured
i
had
no
other
expectation
than
to
be
forever
dishonored
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
next
morning
but
god
had
not
forsaken
me
he
had
again
heard
my
cries
and
was
once
more
to
show
me
his
infinite
mercy
at
three
o
clock
i
heard
three
knocks
at
my
door
and
i
quickly
went
to
open
it
who
was
there
abraham
lincoln
with
a
face
beaming
with
joy
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
but
i
was
not
mistaken
it
was
my
friend
the
most
honest
lawyer
of
illinois
of
the
noblest
men
heaven
has
ever
given
to
earth
it
was
abraham
lincoln
who
had
been
given
me
as
my
saviour
on
seeing
me
bathed
with
tears
he
exclaimed
cheer
up
chiniquy
i
have
the
perjured
priests
in
my
hands
their
diabolical
plot
is
all
known
and
if
they
do
not
fly
away
before
the
dawn
of
day
they
will
surely
be
lynched
bless
the
lord
you
are
saved
the
sudden
passage
of
extreme
desolation
to
an
extreme
joy
came
near
killing
me
i
felt
as
suffocated
and
unable
to
utter
a
single
word
i
took
his
hand
pressed
it
to
my
lips
and
bathed
it
with
tears
of
joy
i
said
may
god
forever
bless
you
dear
lincoln
but
please
tell
me
how
you
can
bring
me
such
glorious
news
here
is
the
simple
but
marvellous
story
as
told
me
by
that
great
and
good
man
whom
god
had
made
the
messenger
of
his
mercies
towards
me
as
soon
as
lebelle
had
given
his
perjured
testimony
against
you
yesterday
said
lincoln
one
of
the
agents
of
the
chicago
press
telegraphed
to
some
of
the
principal
papers
of
chicago
it
is
probable
that
chiniquy
will
be
condemned
for
the
testimony
of
the
rev
lebelle
seems
to
leave
no
doubt
that
he
is
and
the
little
irish
boys
to
sell
their
papers
filled
the
streets
with
the
cries
chiniquy
will
be
hung
chiniquy
will
be
hung
the
roman
catholics
were
so
glad
to
hear
that
that
ten
thousand
extra
copies
have
been
sold
among
those
who
bought
those
papers
was
a
friend
of
yours
called
terrien
who
went
to
his
wife
and
told
her
that
you
were
to
be
condemned
and
when
the
woman
heard
that
she
said
it
is
too
bad
for
i
know
chiniquy
is
not
how
do
you
know
that
said
her
husband
she
answered
i
was
there
when
the
priest
lebelle
made
the
plot
and
promised
to
give
his
sister
of
good
land
if
she
would
swear
a
false
accuse
him
of
a
crime
which
that
woman
said
he
had
not
even
thought
of
with
if
it
be
so
said
terrien
we
can
not
allow
chiniquy
to
be
condemned
come
with
me
to
but
that
woman
being
quite
unwell
said
to
her
husband
you
know
well
i
can
not
go
but
miss
philomene
moffat
was
with
me
then
she
knows
every
particular
of
that
wicked
plot
as
well
as
i
do
she
is
well
go
and
take
her
to
urbana
there
is
no
doubt
that
her
testimony
will
prevent
the
condemnation
of
narcisse
terrien
started
immediately
and
when
you
were
praying
god
to
come
to
your
help
he
was
sending
your
deliverer
at
the
full
speed
of
the
railroad
cars
miss
moffat
has
just
given
me
the
details
of
that
diabolical
plot
i
have
advised
her
not
to
show
herself
before
the
court
is
opened
i
will
then
send
for
her
and
when
she
will
have
given
under
oath
before
the
court
the
details
she
has
just
given
me
i
pity
spink
with
his
perjured
priests
as
i
told
you
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
they
were
lynched
for
there
is
a
terrible
excitement
in
town
among
many
people
who
from
the
beginning
suspect
that
the
priests
have
perjured
themselves
to
destroy
you
now
your
suit
is
gained
and
you
will
have
the
greatest
triumph
a
man
ever
got
over
his
confounded
foes
but
you
are
in
need
of
a
rest
as
well
as
myself
after
thanking
god
for
that
marvellous
deliverance
i
went
to
bed
and
took
the
needed
rest
but
what
was
the
priest
lebelle
doing
in
that
very
moment
unable
to
sleep
after
the
awful
perjury
he
had
just
made
he
had
watched
the
arrival
of
the
trains
from
chicago
with
an
anxious
mind
for
he
was
aware
through
the
confessions
he
had
heard
that
there
were
two
persons
in
that
city
who
knew
his
plot
and
his
false
oath
and
though
he
had
the
promises
from
them
that
they
would
never
reveal
it
to
anybody
he
was
not
without
some
fearful
apprehensions
that
i
might
by
some
way
or
other
become
acquainted
with
his
abominable
conspiracy
not
long
after
the
arrival
of
the
trains
from
chicago
he
came
down
from
his
room
to
see
in
the
book
where
travelers
register
their
names
if
there
was
any
newcomers
from
chicago
and
what
was
his
dismay
when
he
saw
the
first
name
entered
was
that
very
name
philomene
moffat
who
some
time
before
had
gone
to
confess
to
him
that
she
had
heard
the
whole
plot
from
his
own
lips
when
he
had
promised
acres
of
land
to
persuade
his
sister
to
perjure
herself
in
order
to
destroy
me
a
deadly
presentiment
chilled
the
blood
in
his
veins
would
it
be
possible
that
this
girl
is
here
to
reveal
and
prove
my
perjury
before
the
world
he
immediately
sent
for
her
when
she
was
just
coming
from
meeting
lincoln
miss
philomene
moffat
here
he
exclaimed
when
he
saw
her
what
are
you
coming
here
for
this
night
he
said
you
will
know
it
sir
morning
she
answered
ah
wretched
girl
you
come
to
destroy
me
he
exclaimed
she
replied
i
do
not
come
to
destroy
you
for
you
are
already
destroyed
lincoln
knows
oh
my
god
my
god
he
exclaimed
striking
his
forehead
with
his
hands
then
taking
a
big
bundle
of
bank
notes
from
his
he
said
here
are
one
hundred
dollars
for
you
if
you
take
the
morning
train
and
go
back
to
if
you
would
offer
me
as
much
gold
as
this
house
could
contain
i
would
not
go
she
replied
he
then
left
her
abruptly
ran
to
the
of
spink
and
told
him
withdraw
your
suit
against
chiniquy
we
are
lost
he
knows
without
losing
a
moment
he
went
to
the
of
his
and
told
him
make
yourself
and
let
us
take
the
morning
train
we
have
no
business
here
chiniquy
knows
all
our
when
the
hour
of
opening
the
court
came
there
was
an
immense
crowd
not
only
inside
but
outside
its
walls
spink
pale
as
a
man
condemned
to
death
rose
before
the
judge
and
said
please
the
court
allow
me
to
withdraw
my
prosecution
against
chiniquy
i
am
now
persuaded
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
the
faults
brought
against
him
before
this
abraham
lincoln
having
accepted
that
reparation
in
my
name
made
a
short
but
one
of
the
most
admirable
speeches
i
had
ever
heard
on
the
cruel
injustices
i
had
suffered
from
my
merciless
persecutors
and
denounced
the
rascality
of
the
priests
who
had
perjured
themselves
with
such
terrible
colors
that
it
had
been
very
wise
on
their
part
to
fly
away
and
disappear
before
the
opening
of
the
court
for
the
whole
city
was
ransacked
for
them
by
hundreds
who
blamed
me
for
forgiving
them
and
refusing
to
have
my
revenge
for
the
wrong
they
had
done
me
but
i
thought
that
my
enemies
were
sufficiently
punished
by
the
awful
public
disclosures
of
their
infernal
plot
it
seemed
that
the
dear
saviour
who
had
so
visibly
protected
me
was
to
be
obeyed
when
he
was
whispering
in
my
soul
forgive
them
and
love
them
as
was
not
spink
sufficiently
punished
by
the
complete
ruin
which
was
brought
upon
him
by
the
loss
of
the
suit
for
having
gone
to
bishop
o
regan
to
be
indemnified
for
the
enormous
expenses
of
such
a
long
prosecution
at
such
a
distance
the
bishop
coldly
answered
him
i
had
promised
to
indemnify
you
if
you
would
put
chiniquy
down
as
you
promised
me
but
as
it
is
chiniquy
who
has
put
you
down
i
have
not
a
cent
to
give
abraham
lincoln
had
not
only
defended
me
with
the
zeal
and
talent
of
the
ablest
lawyer
i
have
ever
known
but
as
the
most
devoted
and
noblest
friend
i
ever
had
after
giving
more
than
a
year
of
his
precious
time
to
my
defense
when
he
had
pleaded
during
two
long
sessions
of
the
court
of
urbana
without
receiving
a
cent
from
me
i
considered
that
i
was
owing
him
a
great
sum
of
money
my
other
two
lawyers
who
had
not
done
the
half
of
his
work
asked
me
a
thousand
dollars
each
and
i
had
not
thought
that
too
much
after
thanking
him
for
the
inappreciable
services
he
had
rendered
me
i
requested
him
to
show
me
his
bill
assuring
him
that
though
i
would
not
be
able
to
pay
the
whole
cash
i
would
pay
him
to
the
last
cent
if
he
had
the
kindness
to
wait
a
little
for
the
balance
he
answered
me
with
a
smile
and
an
air
of
inimitable
kindness
which
was
peculiar
to
him
my
dear
chiniquy
i
feel
proud
and
honored
to
have
been
called
to
defend
you
but
i
have
done
it
less
as
a
lawyer
than
as
a
friend
the
money
i
should
receive
from
you
would
take
away
the
pleasure
i
feel
at
having
fought
your
battle
your
case
is
unique
in
my
whole
practice
i
have
never
met
a
man
so
cruelly
persecuted
as
you
have
been
and
who
deserves
it
so
little
your
enemies
are
devils
incarnate
the
plot
they
had
concocted
against
you
is
the
most
hellish
one
i
ever
knew
but
the
way
you
have
been
saved
from
their
hand
the
appearance
of
that
young
and
intelligent
miss
moffat
who
was
really
sent
by
god
in
the
very
hour
of
need
when
i
confess
it
again
i
thought
everything
was
nearly
lost
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
occurrences
i
ever
saw
it
makes
me
remember
what
i
have
too
often
forgotten
and
what
my
mother
often
told
me
when
our
god
is
a
god
this
good
thought
sown
into
my
young
heart
by
that
dear
mother
s
hand
was
just
in
my
mind
when
i
told
you
go
and
pray
god
alone
can
save
but
i
confess
to
you
that
i
had
not
faith
enough
to
believe
that
your
prayer
would
be
so
quickly
and
so
marvellously
answered
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
that
interesting
young
lady
last
night
now
let
us
speak
of
what
you
owe
me
well
much
do
you
owe
me
you
owe
me
nothing
for
i
suppose
you
are
quite
ruined
the
expenses
of
such
a
suit
i
know
must
be
enormous
your
enemies
want
to
ruin
you
will
i
help
them
to
finish
your
ruin
when
i
hope
i
have
the
right
to
be
put
among
the
most
sincere
and
devoted
of
your
friends
you
are
right
i
answered
him
you
are
the
most
devoted
and
noblest
friend
god
ever
gave
me
and
i
am
nearly
ruined
by
my
enemies
but
you
are
the
father
of
a
pretty
large
family
you
must
support
them
your
traveling
expenses
in
coming
twice
here
for
me
from
springfield
your
hotel
bills
during
the
two
terms
you
have
defended
me
must
be
very
considerable
it
is
not
just
that
you
should
receive
nothing
in
return
for
such
work
and
well
well
he
answered
i
will
give
you
a
promissory
note
which
you
will
taking
then
a
small
piece
of
paper
he
wrote
he
handed
me
the
note
saying
can
you
sign
that
illustration
iou
after
reading
it
i
said
dear
lincoln
this
is
a
joke
it
is
not
possible
that
you
ask
only
fifty
dollars
for
services
which
are
worth
at
least
two
thousand
he
then
tapped
me
with
the
right
hand
on
the
shoulders
and
said
sign
that
it
is
enough
i
will
pinch
some
rich
man
for
that
and
make
them
pay
the
rest
of
the
bill
and
he
laughed
outright
when
abraham
lincoln
was
writing
the
the
relaxation
of
the
great
strain
upon
my
mind
and
the
great
kindness
of
my
benefactor
and
defender
in
charging
me
so
little
for
such
a
service
and
the
terrible
presentiment
that
he
would
pay
with
his
life
what
he
had
done
for
me
caused
me
to
break
into
sobs
and
tears
as
lincoln
had
finished
writing
the
due
bill
he
turned
round
to
me
and
said
father
chiniquy
what
are
you
crying
for
ought
you
not
to
be
the
most
happy
man
alive
you
have
beaten
your
enemies
and
gained
the
most
glorious
victory
and
you
will
come
out
of
all
your
troubles
in
dear
lincoln
i
answered
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
the
joy
i
should
naturally
feel
for
such
a
victory
is
destroyed
in
my
mind
by
the
fear
of
what
it
may
cost
you
there
were
then
in
the
crowd
not
less
than
ten
or
twelve
jesuits
from
chicago
and
louis
who
came
to
hear
my
sentence
of
condemnation
to
the
penitentiary
but
it
was
on
their
heads
that
you
have
brought
the
thunders
of
heaven
and
earth
nothing
can
be
compared
to
the
expression
of
their
rage
against
you
when
you
not
only
wrenched
me
from
their
cruel
hands
but
you
were
making
the
walls
of
the
tremble
under
the
awful
and
superhumanly
eloquent
denunciation
of
their
infamy
diabolical
malice
and
total
want
of
christian
and
human
principle
in
the
plot
they
had
formed
for
my
destruction
what
troubles
my
soul
just
now
and
draws
my
tears
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
read
your
sentence
of
death
in
their
bloody
eyes
how
many
other
noble
victims
have
already
fallen
at
their
feet
he
tried
to
divert
my
mind
at
first
with
a
joke
sign
this
said
he
it
will
be
my
warrant
of
but
after
i
had
signed
he
became
more
solemn
and
said
i
know
that
jesuits
never
forget
nor
forsake
but
man
must
not
care
how
and
where
he
dies
provided
he
dies
at
the
post
of
honor
and
duty
and
he
left
me
here
is
the
sworn
declaration
of
miss
philomene
moffat
now
philomene
schwartz
state
of
illinois
cook
county
philomene
schwartz
being
first
duly
sworn
deposes
and
says
that
she
is
of
the
age
of
years
and
resides
at
milwaukee
avenue
chicago
that
her
maiden
name
was
philomene
moffat
that
she
knew
father

the
roman
catholic
priest
of
the
french
catholics
of
chicago
during
his
lifetime
and
knows
rev
father
chiniquy
that
about
the
month
of
may
in
company
with
miss
eugenia
bossey
the
housekeeper
of
her
uncle
the
rev
d
lebelle
who
was
then
living
at
the
parsonage
on
clark
street
chicago
while
we
were
sitting
in
the
room
of
miss
bossey
the
rev
lebelle
was
talking
with
his
sister
bossey
in
the
adjoining
room
not
suspecting
that
we
were
there
hearing
his
conversation
through
the
door
which
was
partly
opened
though
we
could
neither
see
him
nor
his
sister
we
heard
every
word
of
what
they
said
together
the
substance
of
which
is
as
lebelle
said
in
substance
to
bossey
his
sister
you
know
that
chiniquy
is
a
dangerous
man
and
he
is
my
enemy
having
already
persuaded
several
of
my
congregation
to
settle
in
his
colony
you
must
help
me
to
put
him
down
by
accusing
him
of
having
tried
to
do
a
criminal
action
with
madame
bossey
answered
i
can
not
say
such
a
thing
against
chiniquy
when
i
know
it
is
absolutely
rev
lebelle
replied
if
you
refuse
to
comply
with
my
request
i
will
not
give
you
the
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
land
i
intended
to
give
you
you
will
live
and
die
madame
bossey
answered
i
prefer
never
to
have
that
land
and
i
like
better
to
live
and
die
poor
than
to
perjure
myself
to
please
the
rev
lebelle
several
times
urged
his
sister
bossey
to
comply
with
his
desires
but
she
refused
at
last
weeping
and
crying
she
said
i
prefer
never
to
have
an
inch
of
land
than
to
damn
my
soul
for
swearing
to
a
the
rev
lebelle
then
said
mr
chiniquy
will
destroy
our
holy
religion
and
our
people
if
we
do
not
destroy
him
if
you
think
that
the
swearing
i
ask
you
to
do
is
a
sin
you
will
come
to
confess
to
me
and
i
will
pardon
it
in
the
absolution
i
will
give
have
you
the
power
to
forgive
a
false
oath
replied
bossey
to
her
brother
the
priest
yes
he
answered
i
have
that
power
for
christ
has
said
to
all
his
priests
what
you
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
what
you
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
mrs
bossey
then
said
if
you
promise
that
you
will
forgive
that
false
oath
and
if
you
give
me
the
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
land
you
promised
i
will
do
what
you
the
rev
d
lebelle
then
said
all
right
i
could
not
hear
any
more
of
that
conversation
for
in
that
instant
miss
eugenia
bossey
who
had
kept
still
and
silent
with
us
made
some
noise
and
shut
the
door
affiant
further
states
that
some
time
later
i
went
to
confess
to
rev
lebelle
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
lost
confidence
in
him
he
asked
me
why
i
answered
i
lost
my
confidence
in
you
since
i
heard
your
conversation
with
your
sister
when
you
tried
to
persuade
her
to
perjure
herself
in
order
to
destroy
father
affiant
further
says
that
in
the
month
of
october
the
rev
d
chiniquy
had
to
defend
himself
before
the
civil
and
criminal
court
of
urbana
illinois
in
an
action
brought
against
him
by
peter
spink
some
one
wrote
from
urbana
to
a
paper
of
chicago
that
father
chiniquy
was
probably
to
be
condemned
the
paper
which
published
that
letter
was
much
read
by
the
roman
catholics
who
were
glad
to
hear
that
that
priest
was
to
be
punished
among
those
who
read
that
paper
was
narcisse
terrien
he
had
lately
been
married
to
miss
sara
chaussey
who
told
him
that
father
chiniquy
was
innocent
that
she
was
present
with
me
when
rev
d
lebelle
prepared
the
plot
with
his
sister
bossey
and
had
promised
her
a
large
piece
of
land
if
she
would
swear
falsely
against
father
chiniquy
narcisse
terrien
wanted
to
go
with
his
wife
to
the
help
of
father
chiniquy
but
she
was
unwell
and
could
not
go
he
came
to
ask
me
if
i
remembered
well
the
conversation
of
rev
d
lebelle
and
if
i
would
consent
to
go
to
urbana
to
expose
the
whole
plot
before
the
court
and
i
consented
we
started
that
same
evening
for
urbana
where
we
arrived
late
at
night
i
immediately
met
abraham
lincoln
one
of
the
lawyers
of
father
chiniquy
and
told
him
all
that
i
knew
about
the
plot
that
very
same
night
the
rev
d
lebelle
having
seen
my
name
on
the
hotel
register
came
to
me
much
excited
and
troubled
and
said
philomene
what
are
you
here
for
i
answered
him
i
can
not
exactly
tell
you
that
but
you
will
probably
know
it
tomorrow
at
the
oh
wretched
girl
he
exclaimed
you
have
come
to
destroy
i
do
not
come
to
destroy
you
i
replied
for
you
are
already
destroyed
then
drawing
from
his
a
big
bundle
of
which
he
said
was
worth
one
hundred
dollars
he
said
i
will
give
you
all
this
money
if
you
will
leave
by
the
morning
train
and
go
back
to
i
answered
him
though
you
would
offer
me
as
much
gold
as
this
room
can
contain
i
can
not
do
what
you
he
then
seemed
exceedingly
distressed
and
he
disappeared
the
next
morning
peter
spink
requested
the
court
to
allow
him
to
withdraw
his
accusations
against
father
chiniquy
and
to
stop
his
prosecutions
having
he
said
found
out
that
he
father
chiniquy
was
innocent
of
the
things
brought
against
him
and
his
request
was
granted
then
the
innocence
and
honesty
of
father
chiniquy
was
acknowledged
by
the
court
after
it
had
been
proclaimed
by
abraham
lincoln
who
was
afterwards
elected
president
of
the
united
states

chapter
lix
moment
of
interruption
in
the
thread
of
my
fifty
years
in
the
church
of
rome
to
see
how
my
sad
previsions
about
my
defender
abraham
lincoln
were
to
be
the
implacable
enemy
of
the
united
wants
to
conquer
and
rule
them
in
order
to
destroy
all
their
rights
privileges
and
liberties
when
it
became
evident
in
that
my
plan
of
forming
a
grand
colony
of
roman
catholic
people
on
the
prairies
of
illinois
was
to
be
a
success
d
arcy
mcgee
then
editor
of
freeman
s
official
journal
of
the
bishop
of
new
york
wrote
me
to
know
my
views
and
immediately
determined
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
similar
enterprise
in
behalf
of
the
irish
roman
catholics
he
published
several
able
articles
to
show
that
the
irish
people
with
very
few
exceptions
were
demoralized
degraded
and
kept
poor
around
their
groggeries
and
showed
how
they
would
thrive
become
respectable
and
rich
if
they
could
be
induced
to
exchange
their
grog
shops
for
the
fertile
lands
of
the
west
through
his
influence
a
large
assembly
principally
composed
of
priests
to
which
i
was
invited
met
at
buffalo
in
the
spring
of
but
what
was
his
disappointment
when
he
saw
that
the
greatest
part
of
those
priests
were
sent
by
the
bishops
of
the
united
states
to
oppose
and
defeat
his
plans
he
vainly
spoke
with
a
burning
eloquence
for
his
pet
scheme
the
majority
coldly
answered
him
we
are
determined
like
you
to
take
possession
of
the
united
states
and
rule
them
but
we
can
not
do
that
without
acting
secretly
and
with
the
utmost
wisdom
if
our
plans
are
known
they
will
surely
be
defeated
what
does
a
skillful
general
do
when
he
wants
to
conquer
a
country
does
he
scatter
his
soldiers
over
the
farm
lands
and
spend
their
time
and
energy
in
ploughing
the
fields
and
sowing
grain
no
he
keeps
them
well
united
around
his
banners
and
marches
at
their
head
to
the
conquest
of
the
strongholds
the
rich
and
powerful
cities
the
farming
countries
then
submit
and
become
the
price
of
his
victory
without
moving
a
finger
to
subdue
them
so
it
is
with
us
silently
and
patiently
we
must
mass
our
roman
catholics
in
the
great
cities
of
the
united
states
remembering
that
the
vote
of
a
poor
journeyman
though
he
be
covered
with
rags
has
as
much
weight
in
the
scale
of
power
as
the
millionaire
astor
and
that
if
we
have
two
votes
against
his
one
he
will
become
as
powerless
as
an
oyster
let
us
then
multiply
our
votes
let
us
call
our
poor
but
faithful
irish
catholics
from
every
corner
of
the
world
and
gather
them
into
the
very
hearts
of
those
proud
citadels
which
the
yankees
are
so
rapidly
building
under
the
names
of
washington
new
york
boston
chicago
buffalo
albany
troy
cincinnati
etc
under
the
shadows
of
those
great
cities
the
americans
consider
themselves
as
a
giant
and
unconquerable
race
they
look
upon
the
poor
irish
catholic
people
with
supreme
contempt
as
only
fit
to
dig
their
canals
sweep
their
streets
and
work
in
their
kitchens
let
no
one
awake
those
sleeping
lions
let
us
pray
god
that
they
may
sleep
and
dream
their
sweet
dreams
a
few
years
more
how
sad
will
their
awakening
be
when
with
our
outnumbering
votes
we
will
turn
them
forever
from
every
position
of
honor
power
and
profit
what
will
those
hypocritical
and
godless
sons
and
daughters
of
the
fanatical
pilgrim
fathers
say
when
not
a
single
judge
not
a
single
teacher
not
a
single
policeman
will
be
elected
if
he
be
not
a
devoted
irish
roman
catholic
what
will
those
giants
think
of
their
matchless
shrewdness
and
ability
when
not
a
single
senator
or
member
of
congress
will
be
chosen
if
he
be
not
submitted
to
our
holy
father
the
pope
what
a
sad
figure
those
protestant
yankees
will
cut
when
we
will
not
only
elect
the
president
but
fill
and
command
the
armies
man
the
navies
and
hold
the
keys
of
the
public
treasury
it
will
then
be
time
for
our
faithful
irish
people
to
give
up
their
in
order
to
become
the
judges
and
governors
of
the
land
then
our
poor
and
humble
mechanics
will
leave
their
damp
ditches
and
muddy
streets
to
rule
the
cities
in
all
their
departments
from
the
stately
mansion
of
mayor
of
new
york
to
the
humble
though
not
less
noble
position
of
teacher
then
yes
then
we
will
rule
the
united
states
and
lay
them
at
the
feet
of
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
that
he
may
put
an
end
to
their
godless
system
of
education
and
sweep
away
those
impious
laws
of
liberty
of
conscience
which
are
an
insult
to
god
and
man
d
arcy
mcgee
was
left
almost
alone
when
the
votes
were
taken
from
that
time
the
catholic
priests
with
the
most
admirable
ability
and
success
have
gathered
their
irish
legions
into
the
great
cities
of
the
united
states
and
the
american
people
must
be
very
blind
indeed
if
they
do
not
see
that
if
they
do
nothing
to
prevent
it
the
day
is
very
near
when
the
jesuits
will
rule
their
country
from
the
magnificent
white
house
at
washington
to
the
humblest
civil
and
military
department
of
this
vast
republic
they
are
already
the
masters
of
new
york
baltimore
chicago
paul
new
orleans
mobile
savannah
cincinnati
albany
troy
milwaukee
louis
san
francisco
etc
yes
san
francisco
the
rich
the
great
queen
of
the
pacific
is
in
the
hands
of
the
jesuits
from
the
very
first
days
of
the
discovery
of
the
gold
mines
of
california
the
jesuits
had
the
hopes
of
becoming
masters
of
these
inexhaustible
treasures
and
they
secretly
laid
their
plans
with
the
most
profound
ability
and
success
they
saw
at
once
that
the
great
majority
of
the
lucky
miners
of
every
creed
and
nation
were
going
back
home
as
soon
as
they
had
enough
to
secure
an
honorable
competence
to
their
families
it
became
then
evident
that
of
those
multitudes
which
the
thirst
of
gold
had
brought
from
every
corner
of
the
world
not
one
out
of
fifty
would
fix
their
homes
in
san
francisco
the
jesuits
saw
at
a
glance
that
if
they
could
persuade
the
irish
catholics
to
settle
and
remain
there
they
would
soon
be
the
masters
and
rulers
of
that
golden
city
whose
future
is
so
bright
and
so
great
and
that
scheme
worked
day
and
night
with
the
utmost
perseverance
has
been
crowned
with
perfect
success
the
consequence
is
that
while
you
find
only
a
few
americans
germans
scotch
and
english
millionaires
in
san
francisco
you
find
more
than
fifty
catholic
irish
millionaires
in
that
city
its
richest
bank
nevada
bank
is
in
their
hands
and
so
are
all
the
street
railways
the
principal
offices
of
the
city
are
filled
with
irish
roman
catholics
almost
all
the
police
are
composed
of
the
same
class
as
well
as
the
volunteer
military
associations
their
compact
unity
in
the
hands
of
the
jesuits
with
their
enormous
wealth
make
them
almost
supreme
masters
of
the
mines
of
california
and
nevada
when
one
knows
the
absolute
abject
submission
of
the
irish
roman
catholics
rich
or
poor
to
their
priests
how
the
mind
the
soul
the
will
the
conscience
are
firmly
and
irrevocably
tied
to
the
feet
of
the
priests
he
can
easily
understand
that
the
jesuits
of
the
united
states
form
one
of
the
richest
and
most
powerful
corporations
the
world
ever
saw
it
is
well
known
that
those
fifty
catholic
millionaires
with
their
myriads
of
employees
are
through
their
wives
and
by
themselves
continually
at
the
feet
of
the
jesuits
who
swim
in
a
golden
sea
no
one
if
he
be
not
a
roman
catholic
or
one
of
those
protestants
who
give
their
daughters
to
the
nuns
and
their
sons
to
the
jesuits
to
be
educated
has
much
hopes
where
the
jesuits
rule
of
having
a
lucrative
office
in
the
san
francisco
the
americans
with
few
exceptions
do
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
dark
cloud
which
is
rising
at
their
horizon
from
rome
though
that
cloud
is
filled
with
rivers
of
tears
and
blood
they
let
it
grow
and
rise
without
even
caring
how
they
will
escape
from
the
impending
hurricane
it
is
to
san
francisco
that
you
must
go
to
have
an
idea
of
the
number
of
secret
and
powerful
organizations
with
which
the
church
of
rome
prepares
herself
for
the
impending
conflict
through
which
she
hopes
to
destroy
the
schools
and
every
vestige
of
human
rights
and
liberties
in
the
united
states
in
order
to
more
easily
drill
the
roman
catholics
and
prepare
them
for
the
irrepressible
struggle
the
jesuits
have
organized
them
into
a
great
number
of

almost
all
these
secret
associations
are
military
ones
they
have
their
headquarters
at
san
francisco
but
their
rank
and
file
are
scattered
all
over
the
united
states
they
number
soldiers
who
under
the
name
of
united
states
volunteer
militia
are
officered
by
some
of
the
most
skillful
generals
and
officers
of
this
republic
another
fact
to
which
the
american
protestants
do
not
sufficiently
pay
attention
is
that
the
jesuits
have
been
shrewd
enough
to
have
a
vast
majority
of
roman
catholic
generals
and
officers
to
command
the
army
and
man
the
navy
of
the
united
states
rome
is
in
constant
conspiracy
against
the
rights
and
liberties
of
man
all
over
the
world
but
she
is
particularly
so
in
the
united
states
long
before
i
was
ordained
a
priest
i
knew
that
my
church
was
the
most
implacable
enemy
of
this
republic
my
professors
of
philosophy
history
and
theology
had
been
unanimous
in
telling
me
that
the
principles
and
laws
of
the
church
of
rome
were
absolutely
antagonistic
to
the
laws
and
principles
which
are
the
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
most
sacred
principle
of
the
united
states
constitution
is
the
equality
of
every
citizen
before
the
law
but
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
church
of
rome
is
the
denial
of
that
equality
liberty
of
conscience
is
proclaimed
by
the
united
states
a
most
sacred
principle
which
every
citizen
must
uphold
even
at
the
price
of
his
blood
but
liberty
of
conscience
is
declared
by
all
the
popes
and
councils
of
rome
a
most
godless
unholy
and
diabolical
thing
which
every
good
catholic
must
abhor
and
destroy
at
any
cost
the
american
constitution
assures
the
absolute
independence
of
the
civil
from
the
ecclesiastical
or
church
power
but
the
church
of
rome
declares
through
all
her
pontiffs
and
councils
that
such
independence
is
an
impiety
and
a
revolt
against
god
the
american
constitution
leaves
every
man
free
to
serve
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
conscience
but
the
church
of
rome
declares
that
no
man
has
ever
had
such
a
right
and
that
the
pope
alone
can
know
and
say
what
man
must
believe
and
do
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
denies
the
right
in
any
body
to
punish
any
other
for
differing
from
him
in
religion
but
the
church
of
rome
says
that
she
has
a
right
to
punish
with
the
confiscation
of
their
goods
or
the
penalty
of
death
those
who
differ
in
faith
from
the
pope
the
united
states
have
established
schools
all
over
their
immense
territories
where
they
invite
the
people
to
send
their
children
that
they
may
cultivate
their
intelligence
and
become
good
and
useful
citizens
but
the
church
of
rome
has
publicly
cursed
all
these
schools
and
forbidden
their
children
to
attend
them
under
pain
of
excommunication
in
this
world
and
damnation
in
the
next
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
based
on
the
principle
that
the
people
are
the
primary
source
of
all
civil
power
but
hundreds
of
times
the
church
of
rome
has
proclaimed
that
this
principle
is
impious
and
heretical
she
says
that
all
government
must
rest
upon
the
foundation
of
the
catholic
faith
with
the
pope
alone
as
the
legitimate
and
infallible
source
and
interpreter
of
the
i
could
cite
many
other
things
proving
that
the
church
of
rome
is
an
absolute
and
irreconcilable
enemy
of
the
united
states
but
it
would
be
too
long
these
are
sufficient
to
show
to
the
american
people
that
rome
is
a
viper
which
they
feed
and
press
upon
their
bosom
sooner
or
later
that
viper
will
bite
to
death
and
kill
this
republic
this
was
foretold
by
lafayette
and
is
now
promulgated
by
the
greatest
thinkers
of
our
time
the
greatest
inventor
or
rather
the
immortal
father
of
electric
telegraphy
samuel
morse
found
it
out
when
in
rome
and
published
it
in
in
his
remarkable
work
conspiracies
against
the
liberties
of
the
united
the
learned
irenรฆus
prime
in
his
life
of
morse
says
when
morse
was
in
italy
he
became
acquainted
with
several
ecclesiastics
of
the
church
of
rome
and
he
was
led
to
believe
from
what
he
learned
from
them
that
a
political
conspiracy
under
the
cloak
of
a
religious
mission
was
formed
against
the
united
states
when
he
came
to
paris
and
enjoyed
the
confidence
and
friendship
of
lafayette
he
stated
his
convictions
to
the
general
who
fully
concurred
with
him
in
the
reality
of
such
a
that
great
statesman
and
patriot
the
late
richard
thompson
secretary
of
the
navy
in
his
admirable
work
the
papacy
and
the
civil
power
says
nothing
is
plainer
than
that
if
the
principles
of
the
church
of
rome
prevail
here
our
constitution
would
necessarily
fall
the
two
can
not
exist
together
they
are
in
open
and
direct
antagonism
with
the
fundamental
theory
of
our
government
and
of
all
popular
government
the
eloquent
spanish
orator
castelar
speaking
of
his
own
church
of
rome
said
in
there
is
not
a
single
progressive
principle
that
has
not
been
cursed
by
the
catholic
church
this
is
true
of
england
and
germany
as
well
as
all
catholic
countries
the
church
cursed
the
french
revolution
the
belgian
constitution
and
the
italian
independence
not
a
constitution
has
been
born
not
a
step
of
progress
made
not
a
solitary
reform
effected
which
has
not
been
under
the
terrific
anathemas
of
the
but
why
ask
the
testimony
of
protestants
or
liberals
to
warn
the
american
people
against
that
conspiracy
when
we
have
the
public
testimony
of
all
the
bishops
and
priests
to
prove
it
with
the
most
daring
impudence
the
church
of
rome
through
her
leading
men
is
boasting
of
her
stern
determination
to
destroy
all
the
rights
and
privileges
which
have
cost
so
much
blood
to
the
american
people
let
the
americans
who
have
eyes
to
see
and
intelligence
to
understand
read
the
following
unimpeachable
documents
and
judge
for
themselves
of
what
will
become
of
this
country
if
rome
is
allowed
to
grow
strong
enough
to
execute
her
threats
the
church
is
of
necessity
intolerant
heresy
she
endures
when
and
where
she
must
but
she
hates
it
and
directs
all
her
energies
to
destroy
it
if
catholics
ever
gain
a
sufficient
numerical
majority
in
this
country
religious
freedom
is
at
an
end
so
our
enemies
say
so
we
shepherd
of
the
official
journal
of
the
bishop
of
louis
no
man
has
a
right
to
chose
his
religion
catholicism
is
the
most
intolerant
of
creeds
it
is
intolerance
itself
we
might
as
rationally
maintain
that
two
and
two
does
not
make
four
as
the
theory
of
religious
liberty
its
impiety
is
only
equalled
by
its
york
official
journal
of
bishop
hughes
the
church
is
instituted
as
every
catholic
who
understands
his
religion
believes
to
guard
and
defend
the
right
of
god
against
any
and
every
enemy
at
all
times
in
all
places
she
therefore
does
not
and
can
not
accept
or
in
any
degree
favor
liberty
in
the
protestant
sense
of
april
the
catholic
church
is
the
medium
and
channel
through
which
the
will
of
god
is
expressed
while
the
state
has
rights
she
has
them
only
in
virtue
and
by
permission
of
the
superior
authority
and
that
authority
can
be
expressed
only
through
the
july
protestantism
has
not
and
never
can
have
any
right
where
catholicity
has
triumphed
therefore
we
lose
the
breath
we
expend
in
declaiming
against
bigotry
and
intolerance
and
in
favor
of
religious
liberty
or
the
right
of
man
to
be
of
any
religion
as
best
pleases
june
religious
liberty
is
merely
endured
until
the
opposite
can
be
carried
into
effect
without
peril
to
the
catholic
rev
o
connor
bishop
of
pittsburgh
the
catholic
church
numbers
the
american
population
and
if
its
membership
shall
increase
for
the
next
thirty
years
as
it
has
the
thirty
years
past
in
rome
will
have
a
majority
and
be
bound

take
this
country
and
keep

the

to
wield
his
vote
for
the
purpose
of
securing
catholic
ascendancy
in
this
country
all
legislation
must
be
governed
by
the
will
of
god
unerringly
indicated
by

be
controlled

the

and
hecker
july
it
was
proposed
that
all
religious

should
be
free

their

publicly
exercised

we
have
rejected
this
article
as
contrary
to

not
only
passed
again
the
sentence
of
death
against
the
schools
of
the

but
he
has
warned
the
americans
that
the
time
is
not
far
away
when
the
roman
catholics
at
the
order
of
the
pope
will
refuse
to
pay
their
school
tax
and
will
send
bullets
to
the
breasts
of
the
government
agents
rather
than
pay
it
the
order
can
come
any
day
from
rome
said
the
prelate
it
will
come
as
quickly
as
the
click
of

it
will

a

may

the

has
an
indirect
jurisdiction
over

even
in

all

says
yes
question
art
because
forgers
of

or
other
disturbers
of

are
justly
punished
with
death
therefore
all
heretics
who
are
forgers
of
faith
and
as
experience
testifies
grievously
disturb
the
this
is
confirmed
because
god
in
the
old
testament
ordered
the
false
prophets
to
be
slain
and
in
deuteronomy
it
is
decreed
that
if
any
one
will
act
proudly
and
will
not
obey
the
commands
of
the
priests
let
him
be
put
to
death
the
same
is
proved
from
the
condemnation
of
the
article
of
john
huss
in
the
council
of
tome
dublin
that
we
may
in
all
things
attain
the
truth
that
we
may
not
err
in
anything
we
ought
ever
to
hold
as
a
fixed
principle
that
what
i
see
white
i
believe
to
be
black
if
the
superior
authorities
of
the
church
define
it
to
be
by
ignatius
loyola
founder
of
the
jesuits
as
for
holy
obedience
this
virtue
must
be
perfect
in
every
point
in
execution
in
will
in
intellect
doing
which
is
enjoined
with
all
celerity
spiritual
joy
and
perseverance
persuading
ourselves
that
everything
is
just
suppressing
every
repugnant
thought
and
judgment
of
one
s
own
in
a
certain
obedience
should
be
moved
and
directed
under
divine
providence
by
his
superior
just
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
acsi
cadaver
which
allows
itself
to
be
moved
and
led
in
every
loyola
if
the
holy
church
so
requires
let
us
sacrifice
our
own
opinions
our
knowledge
our
intelligence
the
splendid
dreams
of
our
imagination
and
the
sublime
attainments
of
human
gregory
no
more
cunning
plot
was
ever
devised
against
the
intelligence

freedom
the
happiness
and
virtue
of
mankind
than
to
the
principal
and
most
efficacious
means
of
practicing
obedience
due
to
superiors
and
of
rendering
it
meritorious
before
god
is
to
consider
that
in
obeying
them
we
obey
god
himself
and
that
by
despising
their
commands
we
despise
the
authority
of
the
divine
master
when
thus
a
religious
receives
a
precept
from
her
prelate
superior
or
confessor
she
should
immediately
execute
it
not
only
to
please
them
but
principally
to
please
god
whose
will
is
known
by
their
command
if
then
you
receive
a
command
from
one
who
holds
the
place
of
god
you
should
observe
it
as
if
it
came
from
god
himself
it
may
be
added
that
there
is
more
certainty
of
doing
the
will
of
god
by
obedience
to
our
superiors
than
by
obedience
to
jesus
christ
should
he
appear
in
person
and
give
his
command
st
philip
used
to
say
that
the
religious
shall
be
most
certain
of
not
having
to
render
an
account
of
the
actions
performed
through
obedience
for
these
the
superiors
only
who
command
them
shall

the

by
the
authority
of
jesus
christ
the
plenitude
of
which
resides
in
his
vicar

pope
we
declare
that
the
teaching
that
the
earth
is
not
the
centre
of
the
world
and
that
it
moves
with
a
diurnal
motion
is
absurd
philosophically
false
and
erroneous

they

shall

without
destroying
their
principles
of

are

admirable

to
to

proclaimed
by

even
christ

all
ye
are
math
god
is
no
respecter

but
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
him
and
worketh
righteousness
is
accepted
with

jesus
called
them
unto
him
and
said
ye
know
that
the
princes
of
the
gentiles
exercise
dominion
over
them
and
they
that
are
great
exercise
authority
upon
them
but
it
shall
not
be
so
among
you
but
whosoever
will
be
great
among
you
let
him
be
your
minister
and
whosoever
will
be
chief
among
you
let
him
be
your
servant
even
as
the
son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
and
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
math
principles
of

proclaimed
by
christ
if
ye
continue
in
my
word
then
are
ye
my
disciples
indeed
and
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
if
the
son
shall
make
you
free
you
shall
be
free
john
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
upon
me
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
he
hath
sent
me
to
heal
the
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives
and
recovering
of
sight
to
the
blind
to
set
at
liberty
them
that
are
luke
where
the
spirit
of
god
is
there
is
cor
tolerance
and
liberty
of
conscience
proclaimed
by
christ
and
they
did
not
receive
him
christ
because
his
face
was
as
though
he
would
go
to
jerusalem
and
when
his
disciples
james
and
john
saw
this
they
said
wilt
thou
that
we
command
fire
to
come
down
from
heaven
and
consume
them
even
as
elias
did
but
he
turned
and
rebuked
them
and
said
ye
know
not
what
spirit
ye
are
of
for
the
son
of
man
is
not
come
to
destroy
man
s
life
but
to
save
luke
then
simon
peter
having
a
sword
drew
it
and
smote
the
high
priest
s
servant
and
cut
off
his
right
ear
the
servant
s
name
was
malchus
then
said
jesus
unto
peter
put
up
thy
sword
into
the
sheath
the
cup
which
my
father
hath
given
me
shall
i
not
drink
it
for
all
they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
matt
john
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
people
of
judea
filled
with
admiration
at
these
sublime
doctrines
of
equality
fraternity
liberty
and
tolerance
should
exclaim
never
man
spake
like
this
man
is
it
on
those
admirable
principles
that
the
church
of
rome
is
founded
no
for
she
has
thousands
of
times
proclaimed
that
her
mission
was
to
destroy
them
all
even
if
she
had
to
wade
in
the
blood
of
those
who
support
them
but
just
as
the
catholic
church
is
not
only
the
very
antipodes
and
the
most
implacable
enemy
of
those
admirable
doctrines
and
principles
so
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
the
ripe
fruit
of
this
divine
seed
sown
by
the
son
of
god
himself
in
the
bosom
of
humanity
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
to
save
the
world
yes
in
reference
to
those
principles
of
fraternity
equality
liberty
and
tolerance
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
to
the
gospel
of
christ
what
the
fruit
is
to
the
tree
which
has
given
it
and
this
is
the
verdict
given
by
the
whole
world
the
church
of
rome
excepted
why
is
it
that
the
poor
the
bruised
the
wounded
and
the
oppressed
from
every
land
turn
their
eyes
their
hearts
and
their
steps
towards
this
country
it
is
because
all
the
echoes
of
heaven
and
earth
have
told
them
that
the
united
states
republic
is
the
land
of
fraternity
equality
and
liberty
as
the
saviour
of
the
world
has
revealed
them
the
pope
of
rome
and
his
jesuits
know
this
better
than
any
one
hence
their
constant
and
supreme
efforts
to
destroy
this
republic
believing
and
preaching
that
it
is
their
duty
to
exterminate
the
individuals
who
differ
from
them
in
religion
they
assume
that
it
is
their
duty
to
destroy
the
governments
and
the
nations
who
refuse
to
submit
to
their
yoke
when
they
can
do
it
safely
the
mission
of
rome
being
to
teach
that
the
inferior
the
people
must
obey
his
superior
just
as
the
corpse
obeys
the
hand
which
moves
it
or
as
the
stick
obeys
the
arm
which
directs
it
she
knows
well
that
she
can
not
fulfill
her
mission
and
attain
her
object
so
long
as
this
government
of
a
free
sovereign
people
stands
she
is
then
bound
to
oppose
paralyze
and
destroy
that
government
when
she
finds
her
opportunity
with
lynx
s
eye
she
watched
that
opportunity
and
with
anxiety
and
rage
she
spied
from
her
cradle
the
onward
march
of
this
young
giant
republic
she
knew
that
it
was
in
the
bosom
of
every
true
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
propagate
those
accursed
by
her
principles
of
equality
fraternity
and
liberty
all
over
the
world
she
saw
that
the
irresistible
influence
of
those
principles
were
felt
on
the
most
distant
nations
as
well
as
on
the
poor
miserable
irish
people
she
was
keeping
under
her
heavy
and
ignominious
yoke
she
understood
that
there
was
a
real
danger
for
her
very
existence
if
those
principles
would
continue
to
spread
that
her
slavery
star
would
go
down
as
the
liberty
star
would
rise
on
the
horizon
in
a
word
rome
saw
at
once
that
the
very
existence
of
the
united
states
was
a
formal
menace
to
her
own
life
already
she
had
seen
the
chains
of
two
millions
of
her
irish
slaves
melted
at
the
simple
touch
of
the
warm
rays
of
liberty
which
had
fallen
from
the
stars
and
stripes
banners
from
the
very
beginning
she
perfidiously
sowed
the
germs
of
division
and
hatred
between
the
two
great
sections
of
this
country
and
she
felt
an
unspeakable
joy
when
she
saw
that
she
had
succeeded
in
dividing
its
south
from
the
north
on
the
burning
question
of
slavery
she
looked
upon
that
division
as
her
golden
opportunity
to
crush
one
party
by
the
other
and
reign
over
the
bloody
ruins
of
both
has
invariably
been
her
policy
she
hoped
that
the
hour
of
her
supreme
triumph
over
this
continent
was
come
she
ordered
her
elder
son
the
emperor
of
france
to
keep
himself
ready
to
help
her
crush
the
north
by
having
an
army
in
mexico
ready
to
support
the
south
and
she
bade
all
the
roman
catholic
bishops
priests
and
people
to
enroll
themselves
under
the
banners
of
slavery
by
joining
themselves
to
the
party
of
democracy
and
everybody
knows
how
the
roman
catholic
bishops
and
priests
almost
to
a
man
obeyed
that
order
only
one
bishop
dared
to
disobey
above
everything
it
was
ordered
to
oppose
the
election
of
lincoln
at
any
cost
for
from
the
very
first
day
his
eloquent
voice
had
been
heard
a
thrill
of
terror
had
gone
through
the
hearts
of
the
partisans
of
slavery
the
democratic
press
which
was
then
and
is
still
now
almost
entirely
under
the
control
of
the
roman
catholics
and
the
devoted
tool
of
the
jesuits
deluged
the
country
with
the
most
fearful
denunciations
against
him
they
called
him
an
ape
a
stupid
brute
a
most
dangerous
lunatic
a
bloody
monster
a
merciless
tyrant
etc
in
a
word
rome
exhausted
all
her
resources
of
language
she
ransacked
the
english
dictionary
to
find
the
most
suitable
expressions
to
fill
the
people
with
contempt
hatred
and
horror
against
him
but
it
was
written
in
the
decrees
of
god
that
the
honest
abraham
lincoln
should
be
proclaimed
president
of
the
united
states
the
of
march
at
the
end
of
august
having
known
from
a
roman
catholic
priest
whom
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
had
persuaded
to
leave
the
errors
of
popery
that
there
was
a
plot
among
them
to
assassinate
the
president
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
go
and
tell
him
what
i
knew
at
the
same
time
giving
him
a
new
assurance
of
gratitude
for
what
he
had
done
for
me
knowing
that
i
was
among
those
who
were
waiting
in
the
he
sent
immediately
for
me
and
received
me
with
greater
cordiality
and
marks
of
kindness
than
i
could
expect
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
again
he
said
you
see
that
your
friends
the
jesuits
have
not
yet
killed
me
but
they
would
have
surely
done
it
when
i
passed
through
their
most
devoted
city
baltimore
had
i
not
defeated
their
plans
by
passing
incognito
a
few
hours
before
they
expected
me
we
have
the
proof
that
the
company
which
had
been
selected
and
organized
to
murder
me
was
lead
by
a
rabid
roman
catholic
called
byrne
it
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
roman
catholics
more
than
that
there
were
two
disguised
priests
among
them
to
lead
and
encourage
them
i
am
sorry
to
have
so
little
time
to
see
you
but
i
will
not
let
you
go
before
telling
you
that
a
few
days
ago
i
saw
morse
the
learned
inventor
of
electric
telegraphy
he
told
me
that
when
he
was
in
rome
not
long
ago
he
found
out
the
proofs
of
a
most
formidable
conspiracy
against
this
country
and
all
its
institutions
it
is
evident
that
it
is
to
the
intrigues
and
emissaries
of
the
pope
that
we
owe
in
great
part
the
horrible
civil
war
which
is
threatening
to
cover
the
country
with
blood
and
ruins
i
am
sorry
that
morse
had
to
leave
rome
before
he
could
know
more
about
the
secret
plans
of
the
jesuits
against
the
liberties
and
the
very
existence
of
this
country
but
do
you
know
that
i
want
you
to
take
his
place
and
continue
that
investigation
my
plan
is
to
attach
you
to
my
ambassador
of
france
as
one
of
the
secretaries
in
that
honorable
position
you
would
go
from
paris
to
rome
where
you
might
find
through
the
directions
of
morse
an
opportunity
of
reuniting
the
broken
threads
of
his
researches
it
takes
a
greek
to
fight
a
as
you
have
been
years
a
priest
of
rome
i
do
not
know
any
man
in
the
united
states
so
well
acquainted
as
you
are
with
the
tricks
of
the
jesuits
and
on
the
devotedness
of
whom
i
could
better
rely
and
when
once
on
the
staff
of
my
ambassador
even
as
one
of
the
secretaries
might
you
not
soon
yourself
become
the
ambassador
i
am
in
need
of
christian
men
in
every
department
of
the
public
service
but
more
in
those
high
positions
what
do
you
think
of
that
illustration
my
dear
president
i
answered
i
feel
overwhelmed
by
your
kindness
surely
nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
to
me
than
to
grant
your
request
the
honor
you
want
to
confer
upon
me
is
much
above
my
merit
but
my
conscience
tells
me
that
i
can
not
give
up
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
to
my
poor
countrymen
who
are
still
in
the
errors
of
popery
for
i
am
about
the
only
one
who
by
the
providence
of
god
has
any
real
influence
over
them
i
am
surely
the
only
one
the
bishops
and
priests
seem
to
fear
in
that
work
the
many
attempts
they
have
made
to
take
away
my
life
are
a
proof
of
it
besides
that
though
i
consider
the
present
president
of
the
united
states
much
above
the
emperors
of
france
russia
and
austria
much
above
the
greatest
kings
of
the
world
i
feel
that
i
am
the
servant
the
ambassador
of
one
who
is
as
much
above
even
the
good
and
great
president
of
the
united
states
as
the
heavens
are
above
the
earth
i
appeal
to
your
own
christian
and
honorable
feelings
to
know
if
i
can
forsake
the
one
for
the
the
president
became
very
solemn
and
replied
you
are
right
you
are
right
there
is
nothing
so
great
under
heaven
as
to
be
the
ambassador
of
but
then
coming
back
to
himself
with
one
of
his
fine
jokes
which
he
had
always
ready
he
added
yes
yes
you
are
the
ambassador
of
a
greater
prince
than
i
am
but
he
does
not
pay
you
with
as
good
cash
as
i
would
he
then
added
i
am
exceedingly
pleased
to
see
you
however
i
am
so
pressed
just
now
by
most
important
affairs
that
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
ask
you
to
give
your
place
to
one
of
my
generals
who
is
there
waiting
for
me
please
come
again
at
ten
o
clock
i
have
a
very
important
question
to
ask
you
on
a
matter
which
has
been
constantly
before
my
mind
these
last
few
the
next
day
i
was
there
at
the
appointed
hour
with
my
noble
friend
who
said
i
could
not
give
you
more
than
ten
minutes
yesterday
but
i
will
give
you
twenty
i
want
your
views
about
a
thing
which
is
exceedingly
puzzling
to
me
and
you
are
the
only
one
to
whom
i
like
to
speak
on
that
subject
a
great
number
of
democratic
papers
have
been
sent
to
me
lately
evidently
written
by
roman
catholics
publishing
that
i
was
born
a
roman
catholic
and
baptized
by
a
priest
they
call
me
a
renegade
an
apostate
on
account
of
that
and
they
heap
upon
my
head
mountains
of
abuse
at
first
i
laughed
at
that
for
it
is
a
lie
thanks
be
to
god
i
have
never
been
a
roman
catholic
no
priest
of
rome
has
ever
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
but
the
persistency
of
the
romish
press
to
present
this
falsehood
to
their
readers
as
a
gospel
truth
must
have
a
meaning
please
tell
me
as
briefly
as
possible
what
you
think
about
my
dear
president
i
answered
it
was
just
this
strange
story
published
about
you
which
brought
me
here
yesterday
i
wanted
to
say
a
word
about
it
but
you
were
too
busy
let
me
tell
you
that
i
wept
as
a
child
when
i
read
that
story
for
the
first
time
for
not
only
my
impression
is
that
it
is
your
sentence
of
death
but
i
have
from
the
lips
of
a
converted
priest
that
it
is
in
order
to
excite
the
fanaticism
of
the
roman
catholic
murderers
whom
they
hope
to
find
sooner
or
later
to
strike
you
down
they
have
invented
that
false
story
of
your
being
born
in
the
church
of
rome
and
of
your
being
baptized
by
a
priest
they
want
by
that
to
brand
your
face
with
the
ignominious
mark
of
apostacy
do
not
forget
that
in
the
church
of
rome
an
apostate
is
an
outcast
who
has
no
place
in
society
and
who
has
no
right
to
live
the
jesuits
want
the
roman
catholics
to
believe
that
you
are
a
monster
an
open
enemy
of
god
and
of
his
church
that
you
are
an
excommunicated
man
for
every
apostate
is
by
that
very
fact
excommunicated
i
have
brought
to
you
the
theology
of
one
of
the
most
learned
and
approved
of
the
jesuits
of
his
time
bussambaum
who
with
many
others
say
that
the
man
who
will
kill
you
will
do
a
good
and
holy
work
more
than
that
here
is
a
copy
of
a
decree
of
gregory
proclaiming
that
the
killing
of
an
apostate
or
an
heretic
and
an
excommunicated
man
as
you
are
declared
to
be
is
not
murder
nay
that
it
is
a
good
a
christian
action
that
decree
is
incorporated
in
the
canon
law
which
every
priest
must
study
and
which
every
good
catholic
must
follow
my
dear
president
i
must
repeat
to
you
here
what
i
said
when
in
urbana
in
my
fear
is
that
you
will
fall
under
the
blows
of
a
jesuit
assassin
if
you
do
not
pay
more
attention
than
you
have
done
till
now
to
protect
yourself
remember
that
because
coligny
was
an
heretic
as
you
are
he
was
brutally
murdered
in
the
bartholomew
night
that
henry
iv
was
stabbed
by
the
jesuit
assassin
revaillac
the
of
may
for
having
given
liberty
of
conscience
to
his
people
and
that
william
the
taciturn
was
shot
dead
by
another
jesuit
murderer
called
girard
for
having
broken
the
yoke
of
the
pope
the
church
of
rome
is
absolutely
the
same
as
she
was
then
she
does
believe
and
teach
as
then
that
she
has
the
right
and
that
it
is
her
duty
to
punish
by
death
any
heretic
who
is
in
her
way
as
an
obstacle
to
her
designs
the
unanimity
with
which
the
catholic
hierarchy
of
the
united
states
is
on
the
side
of
the
rebels
is
an
incontrovertible
evidence
that
rome
wants
to
destroy
this
republic
and
as
you
are
by
your
personal
virtues
your
popularity
your
love
for
liberty
your
position
the
greatest
obstacle
to
their
diabolical
scheme
their
hatred
is
concentrated
upon
you
you
are
the
daily
object
of
their
maledictions
it
is
at
your
breast
they
will
direct
their
blows
my
blood
chills
in
my
veins
when
i
contemplate
the
day
which
may
come
sooner
or
later
when
rome
will
add
to
all
her
other
iniquities
the
murder
of
abraham
when
saying
these
things
to
the
president
i
was
exceedingly
moved
my
voice
was
as
choked
and
i
could
hardly
retain
my
tears
but
the
president
was
perfectly
calm
when
i
had
finished
speaking
he
took
the
volume
of
bussambaum
from
my
hands
read
the
lines
which
i
had
marked
with
red
ink
and
i
helped
him
to
translate
them
into
english
he
then
gave
me
back
the
book
and
said
i
will
repeat
to
you
what
i
said
at
urbana
when
for
the
first
time
you
told
me
your
fears
lest
i
would
be
assassinated
by
the
jesuits
man
must
not
care
where
and
when
he
will
die
provided
he
dies
at
the
post
of
honor
and
but
i
may
add
that
i
have
a
presentiment
that
god
will
call
me
to
him
through
the
hand
of
an
assassin
let
his
will
and
not
mine
be
done
he
then
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
i
am
sorry
that
the
twenty
minutes
i
had
consecrated
to
our
interview
have
almost
passed
away
i
will
be
forever
grateful
for
the
warning
words
you
have
addressed
to
me
about
the
dangers
ahead
to
my
life
from
rome
i
know
that
they
are
not
imaginary
dangers
if
i
were
fighting
against
a
protestant
south
as
a
nation
there
would
be
no
danger
of
assassination
the
nations
who
read
the
bible
fight
bravely
on
the
but
they
do
not
assassinate
their
enemies
the
pope
and
the
jesuits
with
their
infernal
inquisition
are
the
only
organized
power
in
the
world
which
have
recourse
to
the
dagger
of
the
assassin
to
murder
those
whom
they
can
not
convince
with
their
arguments
or
conquer
with
the
sword
unfortunately
i
feel
more
and
more
every
day
that
it
is
not
against
the
americans
of
the
south
alone
i
am
fighting
it
is
more
against
the
pope
of
rome
his
perfidious
jesuits
and
their
blind
and
slaves
than
against
the
real
american
protestants
that
we
have
to
defend
ourselves
here
is
the
real
danger
of
our
position
so
long
as
they
will
hope
to
conquer
the
north
they
will
spare
me
but
the
day
we
will
rout
their
armies
and
the
day
will
surely
come
with
the
help
of
god
take
their
cities
and
force
them
to
submit
then
it
is
my
impression
that
the
jesuits
who
are
the
principal
rulers
of
the
south
will
do
what
they
have
almost
invariably
done
in
the
past
the
dagger
or
the
pistol
of
one
of
their
adepts
will
do
what
the
strong
hands
of
the
warriors
could
not
achieve
this
civil
war
seems
to
be
nothing
but
a
political
affair
to
those
who
do
not
see
as
i
do
the
secret
springs
of
that
terrible
drama
but
it
is
more
a
religious
than
a
civil
war
it
is
rome
who
wants
to
rule
and
degrade
the
north
as
she
has
ruled
and
degraded
the
south
from
the
very
day
of
its
discovery
there
are
only
very
few
of
the
southern
leaders
who
are
not
more
or
less
under
the
influence
of
the
jesuits
through
their
wives
family
relations
and
their
friends
several
members
of
the
family
of
jeff
davis
belong
to
the
church
of
rome
even
the
protestant
ministers
are
under
the
influence
of
the
jesuits
without
suspecting
it
to
keep
her
ascendency
in
the
north
as
she
does
in
the
south
rome
is
doing
here
what
she
has
done
in
mexico
and
in
all
the
south
american
republics
she
is
paralyzing
by
a
civil
war
the
arms
of
the
soldiers
of
liberty
she
divides
our
nation
in
order
to
weaken
subdue
and
rule
it
surely
we
have
some
brave
and
reliable
roman
catholic
officers
and
soldiers
in
our
armies
but
they
form
an
insignificant
minority
when
compared
with
the
roman
catholic
traitors
against
whom
we
have
to
guard
ourselves
day
and
night
the
fact
is
that
the
immense
majority
of
the
roman
catholic
bishops
priests
and
laymen
are
rebels
in
heart
when
they
can
not
be
in
fact
with
very
few
exceptions
they
are
publicly
in
favor
of
slavery
i
understand
now
why
the
patriots
of
france
who
determined
to
see
the
colors
of
liberty
floating
over
their
great
and
beautiful
country
were
forced
to
hang
or
shoot
almost
all
the
priests
and
the
monks
as
the
irreconcilable
enemies
of
liberty
for
it
is
a
fact
which
is
now
evident
to
me
that
with
very
few
exceptions
every
priest
and
every
true
roman
catholic
is
a
determined
enemy
of
liberty
their
extermination
in
france
was
one
of
those
terrible
necessities
which
no
human
wisdom
could
avoid
it
looks
to
me
now
as
an
order
from
heaven
to
save
france
may
god
grant
that
the
same
terrible
necessity
be
never
felt
in
the
united
states
but
there
is
a
thing
which
is
very
certain
it
is
that
if
the
american
people
could
learn
what
i
know
of
the
fierce
hatred
of
the
generality
of
the
priests
of
rome
against
our
institutions
our
schools
our
most
sacred
rights
and
our
so
dearly
bought
liberties
they
would
drive
them
away
from
among
us
or
they
would
shoot
them
as
traitors
but
i
keep
those
sad
secrets
in
my
heart
you
are
the
only
one
to
whom
i
reveal
them
for
i
know
that
you
learned
them
before
me
the
history
of
these
last
thousand
years
tells
us
that
wherever
the
church
of
rome
is
not
a
dagger
to
pierce
the
bosom
of
a
free
nation
she
is
a
stone
to
her
neck
and
a
ball
to
her
feet
to
paralyze
her
and
prevent
her
advance
in
the
ways
of
civilization
science
intelligence
happiness
and
liberty
but
i
forget
that
my
twenty
minutes
are
gone
long
ago
please
accept
my
sincere
thanks
for
the
new
lights
you
have
given
me
on
the
dangers
of
my
position
and
come
again
i
will
always
see
you
with
a
new
my
second
visit
to
abraham
lincoln
was
at
the
beginning
of
june
the
grand
victory
of
the
monitor
over
the
merrimac
and
the
conquest
of
new
orleans
by
the
brave
and
christian
farragut
had
filled
every
heart
with
joy
i
wanted
to
unite
my
feeble
voice
to
that
of
the
whole
country
to
tell
him
how
i
blessed
god
for
that
glorious
success
but
i
found
him
so
busy
that
i
could
only
shake
hands
with
him
the
third
and
last
time
i
went
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
doomed
president
and
to
warn
him
against
the
impending
dangers
which
i
knew
were
threatening
him
was
on
the
morning
of
june
when
he
was
absolutely
besieged
by
people
who
wanted
to
see
him
after
a
kind
and
warm
shaking
of
hands
he
said
i
am
much
pleased
to
see
you
again
but
it
is
impossible
to
say
anything
more
than
this
afternoon
i
will
receive
the
delegation
of
the
deputies
of
all
the
loyal
states
sent
to
officially
announce
the
desire
of
the
country
that
i
should
remain
the
president
four
years
more
i
invite
you
to
be
present
with
them
at
that
interesting
meeting
you
will
see
some
of
the
most
prominent
men
of
our
republic
and
i
will
be
glad
to
introduce
you
to
them
you
will
not
present
yourself
as
a
delegate
of
the
people
but
only
as
the
guest
of
the
president
and
that
there
may
be
no
trouble
i
will
give
you
this
card
with
a
permit
to
enter
with
the
delegation
but
do
not
leave
washington
before
i
see
you
again
i
have
some
important
matters
on
which
i
want
to
know
your
the
next
day
it
was
my
privilege
to
have
the
greatest
honor
ever
received
by
me
the
good
president
wanted
me
to
stand
at
his
right
hand
when
he
received
the
delegation
and
hear
the
address
presented
by
governor
dennison
the
president
of
the
convention
to
which
he
replied
in
his
own
admirable
simplicity
and
eloquence
finishing
by
one
of
his
most
witty
anecdotes
i
am
reminded
in
this
convention
of
a
story
of
an
old
dutch
farmer
who
remarked
to
a
companion
wisely
that
it
was
not
best
to
swap
horses
when
crossing
a
the
next
day
he
kindly
took
me
with
him
in
his
carriage
when
visiting
the
wounded
soldiers
picked
up
on
the
of
the
seven
days
battle
of
the
wilderness
and
the
thirty
days
battle
around
richmond
where
grant
was
just
breaking
the
backbone
of
the
rebellion
on
the
way
to
and
from
the
hospitals
i
could
not
talk
much
the
noise
of
the
carriage
rapidly
drawn
on
the
pavement
was
too
great
besides
that
my
soul
was
so
much
distressed
and
my
heart
so
much
broken
by
the
sight
of
the
horrors
of
that
fracticidal
war
that
my
voice
was
as
stifled
the
only
thought
which
seemed
to
occupy
the
mind
of
the
president
was
the
part
which
rome
had
in
that
horrible
struggle
many
times
he
repeated
this
war
would
never
have
been
possible
without
the
sinister
influence
of
the
jesuits
we
owe
it
to
popery
that
we
now
see
our
land
reddened
with
the
blood
of
her
noblest
sons
though
there
were
great
differences
of
opinion
between
the
south
and
the
north
on
the
question
of
slavery
neither
jeff
davis
nor
any
one
of
the
leading
men
of
the
confederacy
would
have
dared
to
attack
the
north
had
they
not
relied
on
the
promises
of
the
jesuits
that
under
the
mask
of
democracy
the
money
and
the
arms
of
the
roman
catholics
even
the
arms
of
france
were
at
their
disposal
if
they
would
attack
us
i
pity
the
priests
the
bishops
and
the
monks
of
rome
in
the
united
states
when
the
people
realize
that
they
are
in
great
part
responsible
for
the
tears
and
the
blood
shed
in
this
war
the
later
the
more
terrible
will
the
retribution
be
i
conceal
what
i
know
on
that
subject
from
the
knowledge
of
the
nation
for
if
the
people
knew
the
whole
truth
this
war
would
turn
into
a
religious
war
and
it
would
at
once
take
a
tenfold
more
savage
and
bloody
character
it
would
become
merciless
as
all
religious
wars
are
it
would
become
a
war
of
extermination
on
both
sides
the
protestants
of
both
the
north
and
the
south
would
surely
unite
to
exterminate
the
priests
and
the
jesuits
if
they
could
hear
what
professor
morse
has
said
to
me
of
the
plots
made
in
the
very
city
of
rome
to
destroy
this
republic
and
if
they
could
learn
how
the
priests
the
nuns
and
the
monks
who
daily
land
on
our
shores
under
the
pretext
of
preaching
their
religion
instructing
the
people
in
their
schools
taking
care
of
the
sick
in
the
hospitals
are
nothing
else
but
the
emissaries
of
the
pope
of
napoleon
and
the
other
despots
of
europe
to
undermine
our
institutions
alienate
the
hearts
of
our
people
from
our
constitution
and
our
laws
destroy
our
schools
and
prepare
a
reign
of
anarchy
here
as
they
have
done
in
ireland
in
mexico
in
spain
and
wherever
there
are
any
people
who
want
to
be
free
when
the
president
was
speaking
thus
we
arrived
at
the
door
of
his
mansion
he
invited
me
to
go
with
him
to
his
study
and
said
though
i
am
very
busy
i
must
rest
an
hour
with
you
i
am
in
need
of
that
rest
my
head
is
aching
i
feel
as
crushed
under
the
burden
of
affairs
which
are
on
my
shoulders
there
are
many
important
things
about
the
plots
of
the
jesuits
that
i
can
learn
only
from
you
please
wait
just
a
moment
i
have
just
received
some
dispatches
from
general
grant
to
which
i
must
give
an
answer
my
secretary
is
waiting
for
me
i
go
to
him
please
amuse
yourself
with
those
books
during
my
short
minutes
later
the
president
had
returned
with
his
face
flushed
with
joy
glorious
news
general
grant
has
again
beaten
lee
and
forced
him
to
retreat
towards
richmond
where
he
will
have
to
surrender
before
long
grant
is
a
real
hero
but
let
us
come
to
the
question
i
want
to
put
to
you
have
you
read
the
letter
of
the
pope
to
jeff
davis
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
my
dear
president
i
answered
it
is
just
that
letter
which
brought
me
to
your
presence
again
day
before
yesterday
i
wanted
to
come
and
see
you
from
the
very
day
i
read
it
but
i
knew
you
were
so
overwhelmed
with
the
affairs
of
your
government
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
see
you
however
the
anxieties
of
my
mind
were
so
that
i
determined
to
go
over
every
barrier
to
warn
you
again
against
the
new
dangers
and
plots
which
i
knew
would
come
out
from
that
perfidious
letter
against
your
life
that
letter
is
a
poisoned
arrow
thrown
by
the
pope
at
you
personally
and
it
will
be
more
than
a
miracle
if
it
be
not
your
irrevocable
warrant
of
death
before
reading
it
it
is
true
that
every
catholic
could
see
by
the
unanimity
of
the
bishops
siding
with
rebel
cause
that
their
church
as
a
whole
was
against
this
free
republican
government
however
a
good
number
of
irish
german
and
french
catholics
following
more
the
instincts
of
their
noble
nature
than
the
degrading
principles
of
their
church
enrolled
themselves
under
the
banners
of
liberty
and
they
have
fought
like
heroes
to
detach
these
men
from
the
rank
and
file
of
the
northern
armies
and
force
them
to
help
the
cause
of
the
rebellion
became
the
object
of
the
intrigues
of
the
jesuits
secret
and
pressing
letters
were
addressed
from
rome
to
the
bishops
ordering
them
to
weaken
your
armies
by
detaching
those
men
from
you
the
bishops
answered
that
they
could
not
do
that
without
exposing
themselves
to
be
shot
but
they
advised
the
pope
to
acknowledge
at
once
the
legitimacy
of
the
southern
republic
and
to
take
jeff
davis
under
his
supreme
protection
by
a
letter
which
would
be
read
everywhere
that
letter
then
tells
logically
the
roman
catholics
that
you
are
a
bloody
tyrant
a
most
execrable
being
when
fighting
against
a
government
which
the
infallible
and
holy
pope
of
rome
recognizes
as
legitimate
the
pope
by
this
letter
tells
his
blind
slaves
that
you
are
an
infamous
usurper
when
considering
yourself
the
president
of
the
southern
states
that
you
are
outraging
the
god
of
heaven
and
earth
by
continuing
such
a
bloody
war
to
subdue
a
nation
over
whom
god
almighty
has
declared
through
his
infallible
pontiff
the
pope
that
you
have
not
the
least
right
that
letter
means
that
you
will
give
an
account
to
god
and
man
for
the
blood
and
tears
you
cause
to
flow
in
order
to
satisfy
your
ambition
by
this
letter
of
the
pope
to
jeff
davis
you
are
not
only
an
apostate
as
you
were
thought
before
whom
every
man
had
the
right
to
kill
according
to
the
canonical
laws
of
rome
but
you
are
more
vile
criminal
and
cruel
than
the
horse
thief
the
public
bandit
and
the
lawless
brigand
robber
and
murderer
whom
it
is
a
duty
to
stop
and
kill
when
we
take
them
in
their
acts
of
blood
and
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
put
an
end
to
their
plunders
and
murders
and
my
dear
president
the
meaning
i
give
you
of
this
perfidious
letter
of
the
pope
to
jeff
davis
is
not
a
fancy
imagination
on
my
part
it
is
the
unanimous
explanation
given
me
by
a
great
number
of
the
priests
of
rome
with
whom
i
have
had
occasion
to
speak
on
that
subject
in
the
name
of
god
and
in
the
name
of
our
dear
country
which
is
so
much
in
need
of
your
services
i
conjure
you
to
pay
more
attention
to
protect
your
precious
life
and
not
continue
to
expose
it
as
you
have
done
till
the
president
listened
to
my
words
with
breathless
attention
he
replied
you
confirm
me
in
the
views
i
had
taken
of
the
letter
of
the
pope
professor
morse
is
of
the
same
mind
with
you
it
is
indeed
the
most
perfidious
act
which
could
occur
under
present
circumstances
you
are
perfectly
correct
when
you
say
that
it
was
to
detach
the
roman
catholics
who
had
enrolled
themselves
in
our
armies
since
the
publication
of
that
letter
a
great
number
of
them
have
deserted
their
banners
and
turned
traitors
very
few
comparatively
have
remained
true
to
their
oath
of
fidelity
it
is
however
very
lucky
that
one
of
those
few
sheridan
is
worth
a
whole
army
by
his
ability
his
patriotism
and
his
heroic
courage
it
is
true
also
that
meade
has
remained
with
us
and
gained
the
bloody
battle
of
gettysburgh
but
how
could
he
lose
it
when
he
was
surrounded
by
such
heroes
as
howard
reynolds
buford
wadsworth
cutler
slocum
sickles
hancock
barnes
etc
but
it
is
evident
that
his
romanism
superseded
his
patriotism
after
the
battle
he
let
the
army
of
lee
escape
when
it
was
so
easy
to
cut
his
retreat
and
force
him
to
surrender
after
having
lost
nearly
the
half
of
his
soldiers
in
the
last
three
days
carnage
when
meade
was
to
order
the
pursuit
after
the
battle
a
stranger
came
in
haste
to
the
headquarters
and
that
stranger
was
a
disguised
jesuit
after
a
ten
minutes
conversation
with
him
meade
made
such
arrangements
for
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
that
he
escaped
almost
untouched
with
the
loss
of
only
two
guns
you
are
right
continued
the
president
when
you
say
that
this
letter
of
the
pope
has
entirely
changed
the
nature
and
the
ground
of
the
war
before
they
read
it
the
roman
catholics
could
see
that
i
was
fighting
against
jeff
davis
and
his
southern
confederacy
but
now
they
must
believe
that
it
is
against
christ
and
his
holy
vicar
the
pope
that
i
am
raising
my
sacrilegious
hands
we
have
the
daily
proofs
that
their
indignation
their
hatred
their
malice
against
me
are
an
hundredfold
intensified
new
projects
of
assassination
are
detected
almost
every
day
accompanied
with
such
savage
circumstances
that
they
bring
to
my
memory
the
massacres
of
the
bartholomew
and
the
gunpowder
plot
we
feel
at
their
investigation
that
they
come
from
the
same
masters
in
the
art
of
murder
the
jesuits
the
new
york
riots
were
evidently
a
romish
plot
from
beginning
to
end
we
have
the
proofs
in
hand
that
they
were
the
work
of
bishop
hughes
and
his
emissaries
no
doubt
can
remain
in
the
minds
of
the
most
incredulous
about
that
bloody
attempt
of
rome
to
destroy
new
york
when
he
knows
the
easy
way
it
was
stopped
i
wrote
to
bishop
hughes
telling
him
that
the
whole
country
would
hold
him
responsible
for
it
if
he
would
not
stop
it
at
once
he
then
gathered
the
rioters
around
his
palace
called
them
his
dear
friends
invited
them
to
go
back
home
peacefully
and
all
was
finished
so
jupiter
of
old
used
to
raise
a
storm
and
stop
it
with
a
nod
of
his
head
from
the
beginning
of
our
civil
war
there
has
been
not
a
secret
but
a
public
alliance
between
the
pope
of
rome
and
jeff
davis
and
that
alliance
has
followed
the
common
laws
of
this
world
s
affairs
the
greater
has
led
the
smaller
the
stronger
has
guided
the
weaker
the
pope
and
his
jesuits
have
advised
supported
and
directed
jeff
davis
on
the
land
from
the
first
gun
shot
at
fort
sumter
by
the
rabid
roman
catholic
beauregard
they
are
helping
him
on
the
sea
by
guiding
and
supporting
the
other
rabid
roman
catholic
pirate
semmes
on
the
ocean
and
they
will
help
the
rebellion
when
firing
their
last
gun
to
shed
the
blood
of
the
last
soldier
of
liberty
who
will
fall
in
this
fratricidal
war
in
my
interview
with
bishop
hughes
i
told
him
that
every
stranger
who
had
sworn
allegiance
to
our
government
by
becoming
a
united
states
citizen
as
himself
was
liable
to
be
shot
or
hung
as
a
perjured
traitor
and
an
armed
spy
as
the
sentence
of
the
court
martial
may
direct
and
he
will
be
so
shot
and
hanged
accordingly
as
there
will
be
no
exchange
of
such
after
i
had
put
this
flea
in
the
ears
of
the
romish
bishop
i
requested
him
to
go
and
report
my
words
to
the
pope
seeing
the
dangerous
position
of
his
bishops
and
priests
when
siding
with
the
rebels
my
hope
was
that
he
would
advise
them
for
their
own
interests
to
become
loyal
and
true
to
their
allegiance
and
help
us
through
the
remaining
part
of
the
war
but
the
result
has
been
the
very
contrary
the
pope
has
thrown
away
the
mask
and
shown
himself
the
public
partisan
and
the
protector
of
the
rebellion
by
taking
jeff
davis
by
the
hand
and
impudently
recognizing
the
southern
states
as
a
legitimate
government
now
i
have
the
proof
in
hand
that
that
very
bishop
hughes
whom
i
had
sent
to
rome
that
he
might
induce
the
pope
to
urge
the
roman
catholics
of
the
north
at
least
to
be
true
to
their
oath
of
allegiance
and
whom
i
thanked
publicly
when
under
the
impression
that
he
had
acted
honestly
according
to
the
promise
he
had
given
me
is
the
very
man
who
advised
the
pope
to
recognize
the
legitimacy
of
the
southern
republic
and
put
the
whole
weight
of
his
tiara
in
the
balance
against
us
in
favor
of
our
enemies
such
is
the
perfidy
of
those
jesuits
two
cankers
are
biting
the
very
entrails
of
the
united
states
the
romish
and
the
mormon
priests
both
are
quietly
at
work
to
form
a
people
of
the
most
abject
ignorant
and
fanatical
slaves
who
will
recognize
no
other
authority
but
their
supreme
pontiffs
both
are
aiming
at
the
destruction
of
our
schools
to
raise
themselves
upon
our
ruins
both
shelter
themselves
under
our
grand
and
holy
principles
of
liberty
of
conscience
to
destroy
that
very
liberty
of
conscience
and
bind
the
world
before
their
heavy
and
ignominious
yoke
the
mormon
and
the
jesuit
priests
are
equally
the
uncompromising
enemies
of
our
constitution
and
our
laws
but
the
more
dangerous
of
the
two
is
the
romish
priest
for
he
knows
better
how
to
conceal
his
hatred
under
the
mask
of
friendship
and
public
good
he
is
better
trained
to
commit
the
most
cruel
and
diabolical
deeds
for
the
glory
of
god
till
lately
i
was
in
favor
of
the
unlimited
liberty
of
conscience
as
our
constitution
gives
it
to
the
roman
catholics
but
now
it
seems
to
me
that
sooner
or
later
the
people
will
be
forced
to
put
a
restriction
to
that
clause
towards
the
papists
is
it
not
an
act
of
folly
to
give
absolute
liberty
of
conscience
to
a
set
of
men
who
are
publicly
sworn
to
cut
our
throats
the
very
day
they
have
their
opportunity
for
doing
it
is
it
right
to
give
the
privilege
of
citizenship
to
men
who
are
the
sworn
and
public
enemies
of
our
constitution
our
laws
our
liberties
and
our
lives
the
very
moment
that
popery
assumed
the
right
of
life
and
death
on
a
citizen
of
france
spain
germany
england
or
the
united
states
it
assumed
to
be
the
power
in
the
government
of
france
spain
england
germany
and
the
united
states
those
states
then
committed
a
suicidal
act
by
allowing
popery
to
put
a
foot
on
their
territory
with
the
privilege
of
citizenship
the
power
of
life
and
death
is
the
and
two
can
not
exist
on
the
same
territory
without
riots
bloodshed
and
civil
wars
without
end
when
popery
will
give
up
the
power
of
life
and
death
which
it
proclaims
as
its
own
divine
power
in
all
its
theological
books
and
canon
laws
then
alone
it
can
be
tolerated
and
can
receive
the
privileges
of
citizenship
in
a
free
country
is
it
not
an
absurdity
to
give
to
a
man
a
thing
which
he
is
sworn
to
hate
curse
and
destroy
and
does
not
the
church
of
rome
hate
curse
and
destroy
liberty
of
conscience
whenever
she
can
do
it
safely
i
am
for
liberty
of
conscience
in
its
noblest
broadest
highest
sense
but
i
can
not
give
liberty
of
conscience
to
the
pope
and
to
his
followers
the
papists
so
long
as
they
tell
me
through
all
their
councils
theologians
and
canon
laws
that
their
conscience
orders
them
to
burn
my
wife
strangle
my
children
and
cut
my
throat
when
they
find
the
opportunity
this
does
not
seem
to
be
understood
by
the
people
but
sooner
or
later
the
light
of
common
sense
will
make
it
clear
to
every
one
that
no
liberty
of
conscience
can
be
granted
to
men
who
are
sworn
to
obey
a
pope
who
pretends
to
have
the
right
to
put
to
death
those
who
differ
from
him
in
religion
you
are
not
the
first
to
warn
me
against
the
dangers
of
assassination
my
ambassadors
in
italy
france
and
england
as
well
as
professor
morse
have
many
times
warned
me
against
the
plots
of
the
murderers
whom
they
have
detected
in
those
different
countries
but
i
see
no
other
safeguard
against
those
murderers
but
to
be
always
ready
to
die
as
christ
advises
it
as
we
must
all
die
sooner
or
later
it
makes
very
little
difference
to
me
whether
i
die
from
a
dagger
plunged
through
the
heart
or
from
an
inflammation
of
the
lungs
let
me
tell
you
that
i
have
lately
read
a
passage
in
the
old
testament
which
has
made
a
profound
and
i
hope
a
salutary
impression
on
me
here
is
that
the
president
took
his
bible
opened
it
at
the
third
chapter
of
deuteronomy
and
read
from
the
to
the
verse
ye
shall
not
fear
them
for
the
lord
your
god
shall
fight
for
you
and
i
besought
the
lord
at
that
time
saying
o
lord
god
thou
hast
begun
to
show
thy
servant
thy
greatness
and
thy
mighty
hand
for
what
god
is
there
in
heaven
or
in
earth
that
can
do
according
to
thy
words
and
according
to
thy
might
i
pray
thee
let
me
go
over
and
see
the
good
land
that
is
beyond
jordan
that
goodly
mountain
and
lebanon
but
god
was
wroth
with
me
for
your
sakes
and
would
not
hear
me
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
let
it
suffice
thee
speak
no
more
unto
me
of
this
matter
get
thee
up
unto
the
top
of
pisgah
and
lift
up
thine
eyes
westward
and
northward
and
southward
and
eastward
and
behold
it
with
thine
eyes
for
thou
shalt
not
go
over
this
after
the
president
had
read
these
words
with
great
solemnity
he
added
my
dear
father
chiniquy
let
me
tell
you
that
i
have
read
these
strange
and
beautiful
words
several
times
these
last
five
or
six
weeks
the
more
i
read
them
the
more
it
seems
to
me
that
god
has
written
them
for
me
as
well
as
for
moses
has
he
not
taken
me
from
my
poor
log
cabin
by
the
hand
as
he
did
of
moses
in
the
reeds
of
the
nile
to
put
me
at
the
head
of
the
greatest
and
the
most
blessed
of
modern
nations
just
as
he
put
that
prophet
at
the
head
of
the
most
blessed
nation
of
ancient
times
has
not
god
granted
me
a
privilege
which
was
not
granted
to
any
living
man
when
i
broke
the
fetters
of
of
men
and
made
them
free
has
not
our
god
given
me
the
most
glorious
victories
over
our
enemies
are
not
the
armies
of
the
confederacy
so
reduced
to
a
handful
of
men
when
compared
to
what
they
were
two
years
ago
that
the
day
is
fast
approaching
when
they
will
have
to
surrender
now
i
see
the
end
of
this
terrible
conflict
with
the
same
joy
of
moses
when
at
the
end
of
his
trying
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
and
i
pray
my
god
to
grant
me
to
see
the
days
of
peace
and
untold
prosperity
which
will
follow
this
cruel
war
as
moses
asked
god
to
see
the
other
side
of
jordan
and
enter
the
promised
land
but
do
you
know
that
i
hear
in
my
soul
as
the
voice
of
god
giving
me
the
rebuke
which
was
given
to
moses
yes
every
time
that
my
soul
goes
to
god
to
ask
the
favor
of
seeing
the
other
side
of
jordan
and
eating
the
fruits
of
that
peace
after
which
i
am
longing
with
such
an
unspeakable
desire
do
you
know
that
there
is
a
still
but
solemn
voice
which
tells
me
that
i
will
see
those
things
only
from
a
long
distance
and
that
i
will
be
among
the
dead
when
the
nation
which
god
granted
me
to
lead
through
those
awful
trials
will
cross
the
jordan
and
dwell
in
that
land
of
promise
where
peace
industry
happiness
and
liberty
will
make
everyone
happy
and
why
so
because
he
has
already
given
me
favors
which
he
never
gave
i
dare
say
to
any
man
in
these
latter
days
why
did
god
almighty
refuse
to
moses
the
favor
of
crossing
the
jordan
and
the
promised
land
it
was
on
account
of
his
own
nation
s
sins
that
law
of
divine
retribution
and
justice
by
which
one
must
suffer
for
another
is
surely
a
terrible
mystery
but
it
is
a
fact
which
no
man
who
has
any
intelligence
and
knowledge
can
deny
moses
who
knew
that
law
though
he
probably
did
not
understand
it
better
than
we
do
calmly
says
to
his
people
god
was
wroth
with
me
for
your
but
though
we
do
not
understand
that
mysterious
and
terrible
law
we
find
it
written
in
letters
of
tears
and
blood
wherever
we
go
we
do
not
read
a
single
page
of
history
without
finding
undeniable
traces
of
its
existence
where
is
the
mother
who
has
not
shed
tears
and
suffered
real
tortures
for
her
children
s
sake
who
is
the
good
king
the
worthy
emperor
the
gifted
chieftain
who
have
not
suffered
unspeakable
mental
agonies
or
even
death
for
their
people
s
sake
is
not
our
christian
religion
the
highest
expression
of
the
wisdom
mercy
and
love
of
god
but
what
is
christianity
if
not
the
very
incarnation
of
that
eternal
law
of
divine
justice
in
our
humanity
when
i
look
on
moses
alone
silently
dying
on
the
mount
pisgah
i
see
that
law
in
one
of
its
most
sublime
human
manifestations
and
i
am
filled
with
admiration
and
awe
but
when
i
consider
that
law
of
justice
and
expiation
in
the
death
of
the
just
the
divine
son
of
mary
on
the
mountain
of
calvary
i
remain
mute
in
my
adoration
the
spectacle
of
the
crucified
one
which
is
before
my
eyes
is
more
than
sublime
it
is
divine
moses
died
for
his
people
s
sake
but
christ
died
for
the
whole
world
s
sake
both
died
to
fulfill
the
same
eternal
law
of
the
divine
justice
though
in
a
different
measure
now
would
it
not
be
the
greatest
of
honors
and
privileges
bestowed
upon
me
if
god
in
his
infinite
love
mercy
and
wisdom
would
put
me
between
his
faithful
servant
moses
and
his
eternal
son
jesus
that
i
might
die
as
they
did
for
my
nation
s
sake
my
god
alone
knows
what
i
have
already
suffered
for
my
dear
country
s
sake
but
my
fear
is
that
the
justice
of
god
is
not
yet
paid
when
i
look
upon
the
rivers
of
tears
and
blood
drawn
by
the
lashes
of
the
merciless
masters
from
the
veins
of
the
very
heart
of
those
millions
of
defenceless
slaves
these
two
hundred
years
when
i
remember
the
agonies
the
cries
the
unspeakable
tortures
of
those
unfortunate
people
to
which
i
have
to
some
extent
connived
with
so
many
others
a
part
of
my
life
i
fear
that
we
are
still
far
from
the
complete
expiation
for
the
judgments
of
god
are
true
and
righteous
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lord
wants
as
he
wanted
in
the
days
of
moses
another
victim
which
he
has
himself
chosen
anointed
and
prepared
for
the
sacrifice
by
raising
it
above
the
rest
of
his
people
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
that
my
impression
is
that
i
am
the
victim
so
many
plots
have
already
been
made
against
my
life
that
it
is
a
real
miracle
that
they
have
all
failed
when
we
consider
that
the
great
majority
of
them
were
in
the
hands
of
skillful
roman
catholic
murderers
evidently
trained
by
jesuits
but
can
we
expect
that
god
will
make
a
perpetual
miracle
to
save
my
life
i
believe
not
the
jesuits
are
so
expert
in
those
deeds
of
blood
that
henry
iv
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
escape
them
and
he
became
their
victim
though
he
did
all
that
could
be
done
to
protect
himself
my
escape
from
their
hands
since
the
letter
of
the
pope
to
jeff
davis
has
sharpened
a
million
of
daggers
to
pierce
my
breast
would
be
more
than
a
miracle
but
just
as
the
lord
heard
no
murmur
from
the
lips
of
moses
when
he
told
him
that
he
had
to
die
before
crossing
the
jordan
for
the
sins
of
his
people
so
i
hope
and
pray
that
he
will
hear
no
murmur
from
me
when
i
fall
for
my
nation
s
sake
the
only
two
favors
i
ask
of
the
lord
are
first
that
i
may
die
for
the
sacred
cause
in
which
i
am
engaged
and
when
i
am
the
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
my
country
the
second
favor
i
ask
from
god
is
that
my
dear
son
robert
when
i
am
gone
will
be
one
of
those
who
lift
up
that
flag
of
liberty
which
will
cover
my
tomb
and
carry
it
with
honor
and
fidelity
to
the
end
of
his
life
as
his
father
did
surrounded
by
the
millions
who
will
be
called
with
him
to
fight
and
die
for
the
defence
and
honor
of
our
never
had
i
heard
such
sublime
words
never
had
i
seen
a
human
face
so
solemn
and
so
as
the
face
of
the
president
when
uttering
these
things
every
sentence
had
come
to
me
as
a
hymn
from
heaven
reverberated
by
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
of
pisgah
and
calvary
i
was
beside
myself
bathed
in
tears
i
tried
to
say
something
but
i
could
not
utter
a
word
i
knew
the
hour
to
leave
had
come
i
asked
from
the
president
permission
to
fall
on
my
knees
and
pray
with
him
that
his
life
might
be
spared
and
he
knelt
with
me
but
i
prayed
more
with
my
tears
and
sobs
than
with
my
words
then
i
pressed
his
hand
on
my
lips
and
bathed
it
with
my
tears
and
with
a
heart
filled
with
an
unspeakable
desolation
i
bade
him
adieu
it
was
for
the
last
time
for
the
hour
was
fast
approaching
when
he
was
to
fall
by
the
hand
of
a
jesuit
assassin
for
his
nation
s
sake
chapter
lxi
abraham
lincoln
a
true
man
of
god
and
a
true
disciple
of
the
assassination
by
tool
of
the
surratt
s
rendezvous
and
dwelling
place
of
the
surratt
secreted
by
the
priests
after
the
murder
of
assassination
of
lincoln
known
and
published
in
the
town
three
hours
before
its
occurrence
every
time
i
met
president
lincoln
i
wondered
how
such
elevation
of
thought
and
such
childish
simplicity
could
be
found
in
the
same
man
after
my
interviews
with
him
many
times
i
said
to
myself
how
can
this
have
so
easily
raised
himself
to
the
highest
range
of
human
thought
and
philosophy
the
secret
of
this
was
that
lincoln
had
spent
a
great
part
of
his
life
at
the
school
of
christ
and
that
he
had
meditated
his
sublime
teachings
to
an
extent
unsuspected
by
the
world
i
found
in
him
the
most
perfect
type
of
christianity
i
ever
met
professedly
he
was
neither
a
strict
presbyterian
nor
a
baptist
or
a
methodist
but
he
was
the
embodiment
of
all
which
is
more
perfect
and
christian
in
them
his
religion
was
the
very
essence
of
what
god
wants
in
man
it
was
from
christ
himself
he
had
learned
to
love
his
god
and
his
neighbor
as
it
was
from
christ
he
had
learned
the
dignity
and
the
value
of
man
ye
are
all
brethren
the
children
of
god
was
his
great
motto
it
was
from
the
gospel
that
he
had
learned
his
principles
of
equality
fraternity
and
liberty
as
it
was
from
the
gospel
he
had
learned
that
sublime
childish
simplicity
which
alone
and
forever
won
the
admiration
and
affection
of
all
those
who
approached
him
i
could
cite
many
facts
to
illustrate
this
but
i
will
give
only
one
not
to
be
too
long
it
is
taken
from
the
memoirs
of
bateman
superintendent
of
public
instruction
for
the
state
of
illinois
mr
lincoln
paused
for
long
minutes
his
features
surcharged
with
emotion
then
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
in
the
effort
to
retain
or
regain
his
stopping
at
last
he
said
with
a
trembling
voice
and
his
cheeks
wet
with
tears
i
know
there
is
a
god
and
that
he
hates
injustice
and
slavery
i
see
the
storm
coming
and
i
know
that
his
hand
is
in
it
if
he
has
a
place
and
work
for
me
and
i
think
he
has
i
believe
i
am
ready
i
am
nothing
but
truth
is
everything
i
know
i
am
right
because
i
know
that
liberty
is
right
for
christ
teaches
it
and
christ
is
god
i
have
told
them
that
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
and
that
christ
and
reason
say
the
same
thing
and
they
will
find
it
so
douglas
does
not
care
whether
slavery
is
voted
up
or
down
but
god
cares
and
humanity
cares
and
i
care
and
with
god
s
help
i
will
not
fail
i
may
not
see
the
end
but
it
will
come
and
i
shall
be
vindicated
and
those
men
will
see
that
they
have
not
read
their
bible
right
does
it
not
appear
strange
that
men
can
ignore
the
of
this
contest
a
revelation
could
not
make
it
plainer
to
me
that
slavery
or
the
government
must
be
destroyed
the
future
would
be
something
awful
as
i
look
at
it
but
for
this
rock
on
which
i
stand
alluding
to
the
gospel
book
he
still
held
in
his
hand
it
seems
as
if
god
had
borne
with
slavery
until
the
very
teachers
of
religion
had
come
to
defend
it
from
the
bible
and
to
claim
for
it
a
divine
character
and
sanction
and
now
the
cup
of
iniquity
is
full
and
the
vials
of
wrath
will
be
poured
bateman
adds
after
this
the
conversation
was
continued
for
a
long
time
everything
he
said
was
of
a
very
deep
tender
and
religious
tone
and
all
was
tinged
with
a
touching
melancholy
he
repeatedly
referred
to
his
conviction
that
the
day
of
wrath
was
at
hand
and
that
he
was
to
be
an
actor
in
the
struggle
which
would
end
in
the
overthrow
of
slavery
though
he
might
not
live
to
see
the
end
after
further
reference
to
a
belief
in
divine
providence
and
the
fact
of
god
in
history
the
conversation
turned
upon
prayer
he
freely
stated
his
belief
in
the
duty
privilege
and
efficacy
of
prayer
and
he
intimated
in
no
unmistakable
terms
that
he
had
sought
in
that
way
the
divine
guidance
and
the
effect
of
this
conversation
upon
the
mind
of
bateman
a
christian
gentleman
whom
lincoln
profoundly
respected
was
to
convince
him
that
lincoln
had
in
his
quiet
way
found
a
path
to
the
christian
that
he
had
found
god
and
rested
on
the
eternal
truth
of
god
as
the
two
men
were
about
to
separate
bateman
remarked
i
had
not
supposed
that
you
were
accustomed
to
think
so
much
upon
this
class
of
subjects
certainly
your
friends
generally
are
ignorant
of
the
sentiments
you
have
expressed
to
he
quickly
replied
i
know
they
are
but
i
think
more
on
these
subjects
than
upon
all
others
and
i
have
done
so
for
years
and
i
am
willing
you
should
know
inner
life
of
by
carpenter
pages
more
than
once
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
the
presence
of
on
old
prophet
when
listening
to
his
views
about
the
future
destinies
of
the
united
states
in
one
of
my
last
interviews
with
him
i
was
filled
with
an
admiration
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
express
when
i
heard
the
following
views
and
predictions
it
is
with
the
southern
leaders
of
this
civil
war
as
with
the
big
and
small
wheels
of
our
railroad
cars
those
who
ignore
the
laws
of
mechanics
are
apt
to
think
that
the
large
strong
and
noisy
wheels
that
they
see
are
the
motive
power
but
they
are
mistaken
the
real
motive
power
is
not
seen
it
is
noiseless
and
well
concealed
in
the
dark
behind
its
iron
walls
the
motive
power
are
the
few
well
concealed
pails
of
water
heated
into
steam
which
is
itself
directed
by
the
noiseless
small
but
unerring
engineer
s
finger
the
common
people
see
and
hear
the
big
noisy
wheels
of
the
southern
confederacy
s
cars
they
call
them
jeff
davis
lee
toombs
beauregard
semmes
and
they
honestly
think
that
they
are
the
motive
power
the
first
cause
of
our
troubles
but
it
is
a
mistake
the
true
motive
power
is
secreted
behind
the
thick
walls
of
the
vatican
the
colleges
and
schools
of
the
jesuits
the
convents
of
the
nuns
and
the
confessional
boxes
of
rome
there
is
a
fact
which
is
too
much
ignored
by
the
american
people
and
with
which
i
am
acquainted
only
since
i
became
president
it
is
that
the
best
the
leading
families
of
the
south
have
received
their
education
in
great
part
if
not
in
whole
from
the
jesuits
and
the
nuns
hence
those
degrading
principles
of
slavery
pride
cruelty
which
are
as
a
second
nature
among
so
many
of
those
people
hence
that
strange
want
of
fair
play
humanity
that
implacable
hatred
against
the
ideas
of
equality
and
liberty
as
we
find
them
in
the
gospel
of
christ
you
do
not
ignore
that
the
first
settlers
of
louisiana
florida
new
mexico
texas
south
california
and
missouri
were
roman
catholics
and
that
their
first
teachers
were
jesuits
it
is
true
that
those
states
have
been
conquered
or
bought
by
us
since
but
rome
had
put
the
deadly
virus
of
her
and
maxims
into
the
veins
of
the
people
before
they
became
american
citizens
unfortunately
the
jesuits
and
the
nuns
have
in
great
part
remained
the
teachers
of
those
people
since
they
have
continued
in
a
silent
but
most
efficacious
way
to
spread
their
hatred
against
our
institutions
our
laws
our
schools
our
rights
and
our
liberties
in
such
a
way
that
this
terrible
conflict
became
unavoidable
between
the
north
and
the
south
as
i
told
you
before
it
is
to
popery
that
we
owe
this
terrible
civil
war
i
would
have
laughed
at
the
man
who
would
have
told
me
that
before
i
became
the
president
but
professor
morse
has
opened
my
eyes
on
that
subject
and
now
i
see
that
mystery
i
understand
that
engineering
of
hell
which
though
not
seen
nor
even
suspected
by
the
country
is
putting
in
motion
the
large
heavy
and
noisy
wheels
of
the
state
cars
of
the
southern
confederacy
our
people
is
not
yet
ready
to
learn
and
believe
those
things
and
perhaps
it
is
not
the
proper
time
to
initiate
them
to
those
dark
mysteries
of
hell
it
would
throw
oil
on
a
fire
which
is
already
sufficiently
destructive
you
are
almost
the
only
one
with
whom
i
speak
freely
on
that
subject
but
sooner
or
later
the
nation
will
know
the
real
origin
of
those
rivers
of
blood
and
tears
which
are
spreading
desolation
and
death
everywhere
and
then
those
who
have
caused
those
desolations
and
disasters
will
be
called
to
give
an
account
of
them
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
prophet
but
though
not
a
prophet
i
see
a
very
dark
cloud
on
our
horizon
and
that
dark
cloud
is
coming
from
rome
it
is
filled
with
tears
of
blood
it
will
rise
and
increase
till
its
flanks
will
be
torn
by
a
flash
of
lightning
followed
by
a
fearful
peal
of
thunder
then
a
cyclone
such
as
the
world
has
never
seen
will
pass
over
this
country
spreading
ruin
and
desolation
from
north
to
south
after
it
is
over
there
will
be
long
days
of
peace
and
prosperity
for
popery
with
its
jesuits
and
merciless
inquisition
will
have
been
forever
swept
away
from
our
country
neither
i
nor
you
but
our
children
will
see
those
many
of
those
who
approached
abraham
lincoln
felt
that
there
was
a
prophetic
spirit
in
him
and
that
he
was
continually
walking
and
acting
with
the
thought
of
god
in
his
mind
and
had
only
in
view
to
do
his
will
and
work
for
his
glory
speaking
of
the
slaves
he
said
one
day
before
the
members
of
his
cabinet
i
have
not
decided
against
a
proclamation
of
liberty
to
the
slaves
but
i
hold
the
matter
under
advisement
and
i
can
assure
you
that
the
subject
is
on
my
mind
by
day
and
by
night
more
than
any
other
whatever
shall
appear
to
be
god
s
will
i
will
months
in
the
white
by
carpenter
page
a
few
days
before
that
proclamation
he
said
before
several
of
his
counsellors
i
made
a
solemn
vow
before
god
that
if
general
lee
was
driven
back
from
pennsylvania
i
would
crown
the
result
by
the
declaration
of
freedom
to
the
months
in
the
white
but
i
would
have
volumes
to
write
instead
of
a
short
chapter
were
i
to
give
all
the
facts
i
have
collected
of
the
sincere
and
profound
piety
of
abraham
lincoln
i
can
not
however
omit
his
admirable
and
solemn
act
of
faith
in
the
eternal
justice
of
god
as
expressed
in
the
closing
words
of
his
last
inaugural
address
of
the
of
march
fondly
do
we
hope
fervently
do
we
pray
that
this
mighty
scourge
of
war
may
speedily
pass
away
yet
if
god
wills
that
it
continue
until
all
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondman
s
years
of
unrequited
toil
shall
be
sunk
and
until
every
drop
of
blood
drawn
by
the
lash
shall
be
paid
by
another
drawn
by
the
sword
as
was
said
years
ago
so
still
it
must
be
said
the
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
these
sublime
words
falling
from
the
lips
of
the
greatest
christian
whom
god
ever
put
at
the
head
of
a
nation
only
a
few
days
before
his
martyrdom
sent
a
thrill
of
wonder
through
the
whole
world
the
people
and
the
upright
of
every
nation
listened
to
them
as
if
they
had
just
come
from
the
golden
harp
of
david
even
the
infidels
remained
mute
with
admiration
and
awe
it
seemed
to
all
that
the
echoes
of
heaven
and
earth
were
repeating
that
last
hymn
falling
from
the
heart
of
the
noblest
and
truest
gospel
man
of
our
days
the
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
the
of
april
president
lincoln
was
invited
by
general
grant
to
enter
richmond
the
capital
of
the
rebel
states
which
he
had
just
captured
the
ninth
the
beaten
army
of
lee
surrounded
by
the
victorious
legions
of
the
soldiers
of
liberty
were
forced
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
their
banners
at
the
feet
of
the
generals
of
lincoln
the
tenth
the
victorious
president
addressed
an
immense
multitude
of
the
citizens
of
washington
to
invite
them
to
thank
god
and
the
armies
for
the
glorious
victories
of
the
last
few
days
and
for
the
blessed
peace
which
was
to
follow
these
five
years
of
slaughter
but
he
was
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
pisgah
and
though
he
had
fervently
prayed
that
he
might
cross
the
jordan
and
enter
with
his
people
into
the
land
of
promise
after
which
he
had
so
often
sighed
he
was
not
to
see
his
request
granted
the
answer
had
come
from
heaven
you
will
not
cross
the
jordan
and
you
will
not
enter
that
promised
land
which
is
there
so
near
you
must
die
for
your
nation
s
sake
the
lips
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
new
moses
were
still
repeating
the
sublime
words
the
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
when
the
jesuit
assassin
booth
murdered
him
the
of
april
at
o
clock
let
us
hear
the
eloquent
historian
abbott
on
that
sad
event
in
the
midst
of
unparalleled
success
and
while
all
the
bells
of
the
land
were
ringing
with
joy
a
calamity
fell
upon
us
which
overwhelmed
the
country
in
consternation
and
awe
on
friday
evening
april
president
lincoln
attended
ford
s
theatre
in
washington
he
was
sitting
quietly
in
his
box
listening
to
the
drama
when
a
man
entered
the
door
of
the
lobby
leading
to
the
box
closing
the
door
behind
him
drawing
near
to
the
president
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
pistol
and
shot
him
in
the
back
of
the
head
as
the
president
fell
senseless
and
mortally
wounded
and
the
shriek
of
his
wife
who
was
seated
at
his
side
pierced
every
ear
the
assassin
leaped
from
the
box
a
perpendicular
height
of
nine
feet
and
as
he
rushed
across
the
stage
brandished
a
dagger
exclaiming
semper
tyrannis
and
disappeared
behind
the
side
scenes
there
was
a
moment
of
silent
consternation
then
ensued
a
scene
of
confusion
which
it
is
in
vain
to
attempt
to
describe
the
dying
president
was
taken
into
a
house
near
by
and
placed
upon
a
bed
what
a
scene
did
that
room
present
the
chief
of
a
mighty
nation
lay
there
senseless
drenched
in
blood
his
brains
oozing
from
his
wounds
sumner
farwell
and
colfax
and
stanton
and
many
others
were
there
filled
with
grief
and
consternation
the
surgeon
general
barnes
solemnly
examined
the
wound
there
was
silence
as
of
the
grave
the
life
and
death
of
the
nation
seemed
dependent
on
the
result
general
barnes
looked
up
sadly
and
said
the
wound
is
mortal
oh
no
general
no
no
cried
out
secretary
stanton
and
sinking
into
a
chair
he
covered
his
face
and
wept
like
a
child
senator
sumner
tenderly
held
the
head
of
the
unconscious
martyr
though
all
unused
to
weep
he
sobs
as
though
his
great
heart
would
break
in
his
anguish
his
head
falls
upon
the
bloodstained
pillow
and
his
black
locks
blend
with
those
of
the
dying
victim
which
care
and
toil
has
rendered
gray
and
which
blood
has
crimsoned
what
a
scene
sumner
who
had
lingered
through
months
of
agony
having
himself
been
stricken
down
by
the
bludgeon
of
slavery
now
sobbing
and
fainting
in
anguish
over
the
prostrate
form
of
his
friend
whom
slavery
had
slain
this
vile
rebellion
after
deluging
the
land
with
blood
has
culminated
in
a
crime
which
appalls
all
nations
noble
abraham
true
descendant
of
the
father
of
the
faithful
honest
in
every
trust
humble
as
a
child
as
a
woman
who
could
not
bear
to
injure
even
his
most
envenomed
foes
who
in
the
hour
of
triumph
was
saddened
lest
the
feelings
of
his
adversaries
should
be
wounded
by
their
defeat
with
charity
for
all
malice
towards
none
endowed
with
common
sense
intelligence
never
surpassed
and
with
power
of
intellect
which
enabled
him
to
grapple
with
the
most
gigantic
opponents
in
debates
developing
abilities
as
a
statesman
which
won
the
gratitude
of
his
country
and
the
admiration
of
the
world
and
with
graces
and
amiabilities
which
drew
to
him
all
generous
hearts
dies
by
the
bullet
of
the
assassin
of
the
civil
by
abbott
vol
page
but
who
was
that
assassin
booth
was
nothing
but
the
tool
of
the
jesuits
it
was
rome
who
directed
his
arm
after
corrupting
his
heart
and
damning
his
soul
after
i
had
mixed
my
tears
with
those
of
the
grand
country
of
my
adoption
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
asked
my
god
to
grant
me
to
show
to
the
world
what
i
knew
to
be
the
truth
viz
that
that
horrible
crime
was
the
work
of
popery
and
after
twenty
years
of
constant
and
most
difficult
researches
i
come
fearlessly
before
the
american
people
to
say
and
prove
that
the
president
abraham
lincoln
was
assassinated
by
the
priests
and
the
jesuits
of
rome
in
the
book
of
the
testimonies
given
in
the
prosecution
of
the
assassin
of
lincoln
published
by
ben
pitman
and
in
the
two
volumes
of
the
trial
of
john
surratt
in
we
have
the
legal
and
irrefutable
proof
that
the
plot
of
the
assassins
of
lincoln
was
matured
if
not
started
in
the
house
of
mary
surratt
no
h
street
washington
city
but
who
were
living
in
that
house
and
who
were
visiting
that
family
the
legal
answer
says
the
most
devoted
catholics
in
the
city
the
sworn
testimonies
show
more
than
that
they
show
that
it
was
the
common
rendezvous
of
the
priests
of
washington
several
priests
swear
that
they
were
going
there
some
times
and
when
pressed
to
answer
what
they
meant
by
some
times
they
were
not
sure
if
it
was
not
once
a
week
or
once
a
month
one
of
them
less
on
his
guard
swore
that
he
seldom
passed
before
that
house
without
entering
and
he
said
he
never
passed
less
than
once
a
week
the
devoted
roman
catholic
an
apostate
from
protestantism
called
weichman
who
was
himself
living
in
that
house
swears
that
father
wiget
was
in
that
house
and
father
lahiman
swears
that
he
was
living
with
surratt
in
the
same
house
what
does
the
presence
of
so
many
priests
in
that
house
reveal
to
the
world
no
man
of
common
sense
who
knows
anything
about
the
priests
of
rome
can
entertain
any
doubt
that
not
only
they
knew
all
that
was
going
on
inside
those
walls
but
that
they
were
the
advisers
the
counselors
the
very
soul
of
that
infernal
plot
why
did
rome
keep
one
of
her
priests
under
that
roof
from
morning
till
night
and
from
night
till
morning
why
did
she
send
many
others
almost
every
day
of
the
week
into
that
dark
nest
of
plotters
against
the
very
existence
of
the
great
republic
and
against
the
life
of
her
president
her
principal
generals
and
leading
men
if
it
were
not
to
be
the
advisers
the
rulers
the
secret
motive
power
of
the
infernal
plot
no
one
if
he
is
not
an
idiot
will
think
and
say
that
those
priests
who
were
the
personal
friends
and
the
father
confessors
of
booth
john
surratt
and
misses
surratt
could
be
constantly
there
without
knowing
what
was
going
on
particularly
when
we
know
that
every
one
of
those
priests
was
a
rabid
rebel
in
heart
every
one
of
those
priests
knowing
that
his
infallible
pope
had
called
jeff
davis
his
dear
son
and
had
taken
the
southern
confederacy
under
his
protection
was
bound
to
believe
that
the
most
holy
thing
a
man
could
do
was
to
fight
for
the
southern
cause
by
destroying
those
who
were
its
enemies
read
the
history
of
the
assassination
of
admiral
coligny
henry
iii
and
henry
and
william
the
taciturn
by
the
hired
assassins
of
the
jesuits
compare
them
with
the
assassination
of
abraham
lincoln
and
you
will
find
that
one
resembles
the
other
as
one
drop
of
water
resembles
another
you
will
understand
that
they
all
come
from
the
same
source
rome
in
all
those
murders
you
will
find
that
the
murderers
selected
and
trained
by
the
jesuits
were
of
the
most
exalted
roman
catholic
piety
living
in
the
company
of
priests
going
to
confess
very
often
receiving
the
communion
the
day
before
if
not
the
very
day
of
the
murder
you
will
see
in
all
those
horrible
deeds
of
hell
prepared
behind
the
dark
walls
of
the
holy
inquisition
that
the
assassins
were
considering
themselves
as
the
chosen
instruments
of
god
to
save
the
nation
by
striking
its
tyrant
that
they
firmly
believed
that
there
was
no
sin
in
killing
the
enemy
of
the
people
of
the
holy
church
and
of
the
infallible
pope
compare
the
last
hours
of
the
jesuit
ravaillac
the
assassin
of
henry
who
absolutely
refuses
to
repent
though
suffering
the
most
horrible
tortures
on
the
rack
with
booth
who
suffering
also
the
most
horrible
tortures
from
his
broken
leg
writes
in
his
daily
memorandum
the
very
day
before
his
death
i
can
never
repent
though
we
hated
to
kill
our
country
owed
all
our
troubles
to
him
lincoln
and
god
simply
made
me
the
instrument
of
his
of
vol
page
yes
compare
the
bloody
deeds
of
those
two
assassins
and
you
will
see
that
they
had
been
trained
in
the
same
school
they
had
been
taught
by
the
same
teachers
evidently
the
jesuit
ravaillac
calling
all
the
saints
of
heaven
to
his
help
at
his
last
hour
and
booth
pressing
the
medal
of
the
virgin
mary
on
his
breast
when
falling
mortally
wounded
of
page
both
came
from
the
same
jesuit
mould
who
has
lost
his
common
sense
enough
to
suppose
that
it
was
jeff
davis
who
had
filled
the
mind
and
the
heart
of
booth
with
that
religious
and
so
exalted
fanaticism
surely
jeff
davis
could
have
promised
the
money
to
reward
the
assassins
and
nerve
their
arms
by
the
hope
of
becoming
rich
the
testimonies
on
that
account
says
that
one
million
dollars
had
been
asked
from
him
of
abraham
p
the
could
give
the
money
but
the
jesuits
alone
could
select
the
assassins
train
them
and
show
them
a
crown
of
glory
in
heaven
if
they
would
kill
the
author
of
the
bloodshed
the
famous
renegade
and
enemy
of
the
pope
and
of
the
who
does
not
see
the
lessons
given
by
the
jesuits
to
booth
in
their
daily
intercourse
in
mary
surratt
s
house
when
he
reads
those
lines
written
by
booth
a
few
hours
before
his
death
i
can
never
repent
god
made
me
the
instrument
of
his
punishment
compare
these
words
with
the
doctrines
and
principles
taught
by
the
councils
the
decrees
of
the
pope
and
the
laws
of
holy
inquisition
as
you
find
them
in
chapter
of
this
volume
and
you
will
find
that
the
sentiments
and
belief
of
booth
flow
from
those
principles
as
the
river
flows
from
its
source
and
that
pious
miss
surratt
who
the
very
next
day
after
the
murder
of
lincoln
said
without
being
rebuked
in
the
presence
of
several
other
witnesses
the
death
of
abraham
lincoln
is
no
more
than
the
death
of
any
nigger
in
the
army
where
did
she
get
that
maxim
if
not
from
her
church
had
not
that
church
recently
proclaimed
through
her
highest
legal
and
civil
authority
the
devoted
roman
catholic
judge
taney
in
his
decision
that
negroes
have
no
right
which
the
white
is
bound
to
respect
by
bringing
the
president
on
a
level
with
the
lowest
nigger
rome
was
saying
that
he
had
no
right
even
to
his
life
for
this
was
the
maxim
of
the
rebel
priests
who
everywhere
had
made
themselves
the
echoes
of
the
sentence
of
their
distinguished
it
was
from
the
very
lips
of
the
priests
who
were
constantly
coming
in
and
going
out
of
their
house
that
those
young
ladies
had
learned
those
and
doctrines
read
in
the
testimony
concerning
mary
surratt
how
the
jesuits
had
perfectly
drilled
her
in
the
art
of
perjuring
herself
in
the
very
moment
when
the
government
officer
orders
her
to
prepare
herself
with
her
daughter
to
follow
him
as
prisoners
at
about
payne
the
murderer
of
seward
knocks
at
the
door
and
wants
to
see
surratt
but
instead
of
having
surratt
to
open
the
door
he
finds
himself
confronted
face
to
face
with
the
government
detective
major
smith
who
swears
i
questioned
him
in
regard
to
his
occupation
and
what
business
he
had
at
the
house
at
this
late
hour
of
the
night
he
stated
that
he
was
a
laborer
and
had
come
to
dig
a
gutter
at
the
request
of
surratt
i
went
to
the
parlor
door
and
said
mrs
surratt
will
you
step
here
a
minute
she
came
out
and
i
asked
her
do
you
know
this
man
and
did
you
hire
him
to
come
and
dig
a
gutter
for
you
she
answered
raising
her
right
hand
before
god
sir
i
do
not
know
this
man
i
have
never
seen
him
and
i
did
not
hire
him
to
dig
a
gutter
for
of
but
it
was
proved
after
by
several
unimpeachable
witnesses
that
she
knew
very
well
that
payne
was
a
personal
friend
of
her
son
who
many
times
had
come
to
her
house
in
company
of
his
friend
and
pet
booth
she
had
received
the
communion
just
two
or
three
days
before
that
public
perjury
just
a
moment
after
making
it
the
officer
ordered
her
to
step
out
into
the
carriage
before
doing
it
she
asked
permission
to
kneel
down
and
pray
which
was
granted
page
i
ask
it
from
any
man
of
common
sense
could
jeff
davis
have
imparted
such
a
religious
calm
and
to
that
woman
when
her
hands
were
just
reddened
with
the
blood
of
the
president
and
she
was
on
her
way
to
trial
no
such
such
calm
in
that
soul
in
such
a
terrible
and
solemn
hour
could
only
come
from
the
teachings
of
those
jesuits
who
for
more
than
six
months
were
in
her
house
showing
her
a
crown
of
eternal
glory
if
she
would
help
to
kill
the
monster
only
cause
of
that
horrible
civil
war
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
priests
had
perfectly
succeeded
in
persuading
mary
surratt
and
booth
that
the
killing
of
lincoln
was
a
most
holy
and
deserving
work
for
which
god
had
an
eternal
reward
in
store
there
is
a
fact
to
which
the
american
people
have
not
yet
given
a
sufficient
attention
it
is
that
without
a
single
exception
the
conspirators
were
roman
catholics
the
learned
and
great
patriot
general
baker
in
his
admirable
report
struck
and
bewildered
by
that
strange
mysterious
and
portentous
fact
said
i
mention
as
an
exceptional
and
remarkable
fact
that
every
conspirator
in
custody
is
by
education
a
but
those
words
which
if
well
understood
by
the
united
states
would
have
thrown
so
much
light
on
the
true
causes
of
their
untold
and
unspeakable
disasters
fell
as
if
on
the
ears
of
deaf
men
very
few
if
any
paid
attention
to
them
as
general
baker
says
all
the
conspirators
were
attending
catholic
church
services
and
were
educated
roman
catholics
it
is
true
that
some
of
them
as
atzeroth
payne
and
harold
asked
for
protestant
ministers
when
they
were
to
be
hung
but
they
had
been
considered
till
then
as
converts
to
romanism
at
page
of
trial
of
john
louis
weichman
tells
us
that
he
was
going
to
aloysin
s
church
with
atzeroth
and
that
it
was
there
that
he
introduced
him
to
brothy
another
roman
catholic
it
is
a
well
authenticated
fact
that
booth
and
weichman
who
were
themselves
protestant
perverts
to
romanism
had
proselytized
a
good
number
of
and
infidels
who
either
from
conviction
or
from
hope
of
the
fortunes
promised
to
the
successful
murderers
were
themselves
very
zealous
for
the
church
of
rome
payne
atzeroth
and
harold
were
among
those
proselytes
but
when
those
murderers
were
to
appear
before
the
country
and
receive
the
just
punishment
of
their
crime
the
jesuits
were
too
shrewd
to
ignore
that
if
they
were
all
coming
on
the
scaffold
as
roman
catholics
and
accompanied
by
their
father
confessors
it
would
at
once
open
the
eyes
of
the
american
people
and
clearly
show
that
this
was
a
roman
catholic
plot
they
persuaded
three
of
their
proselytes
to
avail
themselves
of
the
theological
principles
of
the
church
of
rome
that
a
man
is
allowed
to
conceal
his
religion
nay
that
he
may
say
that
he
is
an
heretic
a
protestant
though
he
is
a
roman
catholic
when
it
is
for
his
own
interest
or
the
best
interests
of
his
church
to
conceal
the
truth
and
deceive
the
people
here
is
the
doctrine
of
rome
on
that
subject
soepe
melius
est
ad
dei

quam

b
chap
it
is
often
more
to
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
our
neighbor
to
conceal
our
religious
faith
as
when
we
live
among
heretics
we
can
more
easily
do
them
good
in
that
way
or
if
by
declaring
our
religion
we
cause
some
disturbances
or
deaths
or
even
the
wrath
of
the
it
is
evident
that
the
jesuits
had
never
had
better
reasons
to
suspect
that
the
declaration
of
their
religion
would
damage
them
and
excite
the
wrath
of
their
tyrant
viz
the
american
people
lloyd
s
in
whose
house
surratt
concealed
the
carbine
which
booth
wanted
for
protection
when
just
after
the
murder
he
was
to
flee
towards
the
southern
states
was
a
firm
roman
catholic
nudd
at
whose
place
booth
stopped
to
have
his
broken
leg
dressed
was
a
roman
catholic
and
so
was
garrett
in
whose
barn
booth
was
caught
and
killed
why
so
because
as
jeff
davis
was
the
only
man
to
pay
one
million
dollars
to
those
who
would
kill
abraham
lincoln
the
jesuits
were
the
only
men
to
select
the
murderers
and
prepare
everything
to
protect
them
after
their
diabolical
deed
and
such
murderers
could
not
be
found
except
among
their
blind
and
fanatical
slaves
the
great
the
fatal
mistake
of
the
american
government
in
the
prosecution
of
the
assassins
of
abraham
lincoln
was
to
constantly
keep
out
of
sight
the
religious
element
of
that
terrible
drama
nothing
would
have
been
more
easy
then
than
to
find
out
the
complicity
of
the
priests
who
were
not
only
coming
every
week
and
every
day
but
who
were
even
living
in
that
den
of
murderers
but
this
was
carefully
avoided
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
trial
when
not
long
after
the
execution
of
the
murderers
i
went
incognito
to
washington
to
begin
my
investigation
about
its
real
and
true
authors
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
that
not
a
single
one
of
the
government
men
to
whom
i
addressed
myself
would
consent
to
have
any
talk
with
me
on
that
matter
except
after
i
had
given
my
word
of
honor
that
i
would
never
mention
their
names
in
connection
with
the
result
of
my
investigation
i
saw
with
a
profound
distress
that
the
influence
of
rome
was
almost
supreme
in
washington
i
could
not
find
a
single
statesman
who
would
dare
to
face
that
nefarious
influence
and
fight
it
down
except
general
baker
several
of
the
government
men
in
whom
i
had
more
confidence
told
me
we
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
jesuits
were
at
the
bottom
of
that
great
iniquity
we
even
feared
sometimes
that
this
would
come
out
so
clearly
before
the
military
tribunal
that
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
keeping
it
out
of
the
public
sight
this
was
not
through
cowardice
as
you
think
but
through
a
wisdom
which
you
ought
to
approve
if
you
can
not
admire
it
had
we
been
in
days
of
peace
we
know
that
with
a
little
more
pressure
on
the
witnesses
many
priests
would
have
been
compromised
for
surratt
s
house
was
their
common
rendezvous
it
is
more
than
probable
that
several
of
them
might
have
been
hung
but
the
civil
war
was
hardly
over
the
confederacy
though
broken
down
was
still
living
in
millions
of
hearts
murderers
and
formidable
elements
of
discord
were
still
seen
everywhere
to
which
the
hanging
or
exiling
of
those
priests
would
have
given
a
new
life
riots
after
riots
would
have
accompanied
and
followed
their
execution
we
thought
we
had
had
enough
of
blood
fires
devastations
and
bad
feelings
we
were
all
longing
after
days
of
peace
the
country
was
in
need
of
them
we
concluded
that
the
best
interests
of
humanity
was
to
punish
only
those
who
were
publicly
and
visibly
guilty
that
the
verdict
might
receive
the
approbation
of
all
without
creating
any
new
bad
feelings
allow
us
also
to
tell
you
that
this
policy
was
that
of
our
late
president
for
you
know
it
well
there
was
nothing
which
that
great
and
good
man
feared
so
much
as
to
arm
the
protestants
against
the
catholics
and
the
catholics
against
the
but
if
any
one
has
still
any
doubts
of
the
complicity
of
the
jesuits
in
the
murder
of
abraham
lincoln
let
them
give
a
moment
of
attention
to
the
following
facts
and
their
doubts
will
be
forever
removed
it
is
only
from
the
very
jesuit
accomplice
s
lips
that
i
take
my
sworn
testimonies
it
is
evident
that
a
very
elaborate
plan
of
escape
had
been
prepared
by
the
priests
of
rome
to
save
the
lives
of
the
assassins
and
the
conspirators
it
would
be
too
long
to
follow
all
the
murderers
when
they
were
fleeing
in
every
direction
to
escape
the
vengeance
of
god
and
man
let
us
fix
our
eyes
on
john
surratt
who
was
in
washington
on
the
of
april
helping
booth
in
the
perpetration
of
the
assassination
who
will
take
care
of
him
who
will
protect
and
conceal
him
who
will
press
him
on
their
bosoms
put
their
mantles
on
his
shoulders
to
conceal
him
from
the
just
vengeance
of
the
human
and
divine
laws
the
priest
charles
boucher
of
john
vol
page
swears
that
only
a
few
days
after
the
murder
john
surratt
was
sent
to
him
by
father
lapierre
of
montreal
that
he
kept
him
concealed
in
his
parsonage
of
liboire
from
the
end
of
april
to
the
end
of
july
then
he
took
him
back
secretly
to
father
lapierre
who
kept
him
secreted
in
his
own
father
s
house
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
montreal
bishop
s
palace
he
swears
that
father
lapierre
visited
him
surratt
often
when
secreted
at
liboire
and
that
he
father
boucher
visited
him
at
least
twice
a
week
from
the
end
of
july
to
september
when
concealed
in
father
lapierre
s
house
in
montreal
that
same
father
charles
boucher
swears
that
he
accompanied
john
surratt
in
a
carriage
in
the
company
of
father
lapierre
to
the
steamer
montreal
when
starting
for
quebec
that
father
lapierre
kept
him
john
surratt
under
lock
during
the
voyage
from
montreal
to
quebec
and
that
he
accompanied
him
disguised
from
the
montreal
steamer
to
the
ocean
steamer
of
john
the
doctor
of
the
steamer
peruvian
i
mcmillan
swears
vol
that
father
lapierre
introduced
him
to
john
surratt
under
the
false
name
of
mccarthy
whom
he
was
keeping
locked
in
his
state
room
and
whom
he
conducted
disguised
to
the
ocean
steamer
peruvian
and
with
whom
he
remained
till
he
left
quebec
for
europe
the
of
september
but
who
is
that
father
lapierre
who
takes
such
a
tender
i
dare
say
a
paternal
care
of
surratt
it
is
not
less
a
personage
than
the
canon
of
bishop
bourget
of
montreal
he
is
the
confidential
man
of
the
bishop
he
lives
with
the
bishop
eats
at
his
table
assists
him
with
his
counsel
and
has
to
receive
his
advice
in
every
step
of
life
according
to
the
laws
of
rome
the
canons
are
to
the
bishop
what
the
arms
are
to
the
body
now
i
ask
is
it
not
evident
that
the
bishops
and
the
priests
of
washington
have
trusted
this
murderer
to
the
tender
care
of
the
bishops
and
priests
of
montreal
that
they
might
conceal
feed
and
protect
him
for
nearly
six
months
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
bishop
s
palace
would
they
have
done
that
if
they
were
not
his
accomplices
why
did
they
so
continually
remain
with
him
day
and
night
if
they
were
not
in
fear
that
he
might
compromise
them
by
an
indiscreet
word
why
do
we
see
those
priests
i
ought
to
say
those
two
ambassadors
and
appointed
representatives
of
the
pope
alone
in
the
carriage
which
takes
that
great
culprit
from
his
house
of
concealment
to
the
steamer
why
do
they
keep
him
there
under
lock
till
they
transfer
him
under
a
disguised
name
to
the
oceanic
steamer
the
peruvian
the
of
july
why
such
tender
sympathies
for
that
stranger
why
go
through
such
trouble
and
expense
for
that
young
american
among
the
bishops
and
priests
of
canada
there
is
only
one
answer
he
was
one
of
their
tools
one
of
their
selected
men
to
strike
the
great
republic
of
equality
and
liberty
to
the
heart
for
more
than
six
months
before
the
murder
the
priests
had
lodged
eaten
conversed
slept
with
him
under
the
same
roof
in
washington
they
had
trained
him
to
his
deed
of
blood
by
promising
him
protection
on
earth
and
a
crown
of
glory
in
heaven
if
he
would
only
be
true
to
their
designs
to
the
end
and
he
had
been
true
to
the
end
now
the
great
crime
is
accomplished
lincoln
is
murdered
jeff
davis
the
dear
son
of
the
pope
is
avenged
the
great
republic
has
been
struck
to
the
heart
the
soldiers
of
liberty
all
over
the
world
are
weeping
over
the
dead
form
of
the
one
who
had
led
them
to
victory
a
cry
of
desolation
goes
from
earth
to
heaven
it
seems
as
if
we
heard
the
of
the
cause
of
freedom
equality
and
fraternity
among
men
it
was
many
centuries
since
the
implacable
enemies
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
men
had
struck
such
a
giant
foe
their
joy
was
as
great
as
their
victory
complete
but
do
you
see
that
man
fleeing
from
washington
toward
the
north
he
has
the
mark
of
cain
on
his
forehead
his
hands
are
reddened
with
blood
he
is
pale
and
trembling
for
he
knows
it
a
whole
outraged
nation
is
after
him
for
her
just
vengeance
he
hears
the
thundering
voice
of
god
where
is
thy
brother
where
will
he
find
a
refuge
where
outside
of
hell
will
he
meet
friends
to
shelter
and
save
him
from
the
just
vengeance
of
god
and
men
oh
he
has
sure
refuge
in
the
arms
of
that
church
which
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
is
crying
death
to
all
heretics
death
to
all
the
soldiers
of
liberty
he
has
devoted
friends
among
the
very
men
who
after
having
prepared
the
massacre
of
admiral
coligny
and
his
protestant
countrymen
rang
the
bells
of
rome
to
express
their
joy
when
they
heard
that
at
last
the
king
of
france
had
slaughtered
them
all
but
where
will
those
bishops
and
priests
of
canada
send
john
surratt
when
they
find
it
impossible
to
conceal
him
any
longer
from
the
thousands
of
detectives
of
the
united
states
who
are
ransacking
canada
to
find
out
his
retreat
who
will
conceal
feed
lodge
and
protect
him
after
the
priests
of
canada
pressed
his
hand
for
the
last
time
on
board
of
the
peruvian
the
of
september
who
can
have
any
doubt
about
that
who
can
suppose
that
any
one
but
the
pope
himself
and
his
jesuits
will
protect
the
murderer
of
abraham
lincoln
in
europe
if
you
want
to
see
him
after
he
has
crossed
the
ocean
go
to
vitry
at
the
door
of
rome
and
there
you
will
find
him
enrolled
under
the
banners
of
the
pope
in
the
company
of
his
zouaves
under
the
false
name
of
watson
of
john
vol
of
course
the
pope
was
forced
to
withdraw
his
protection
over
him
after
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
found
him
there
and
he
was
brought
back
to
washington
to
be
tried
but
on
his
arrival
as
a
prisoner
in
the
united
states
his
jesuit
father
confessor
whispered
in
his
ear
fear
not
you
will
not
be
condemned
through
the
influence
of
a
high
roman
catholic
lady
two
or
three
of
the
jurymen
will
be
roman
catholics
and
you
will
be
those
who
have
read
the
two
volumes
of
the
trial
of
john
surratt
know
that
never
more
evident
proofs
of
guilt
were
brought
against
a
murderer
than
in
that
case
but
the
roman
catholic
jurymen
had
read
the
theology
of
thomas
a
book
which
the
pope
had
ordered
to
be
taught
in
every
college
academy
and
university
of
rome
they
had
learned
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
roman
catholics
to
exterminate
all
the
thomas
vol
they
had
read
the
decree
of
the
councils
of
constance
that
no
faith
was
to
be
kept
with
heretics
they
had
read
in
the
council
of
lateran
that
the
catholics
who
arm
themselves
for
the
extermination
of
heretics
have
all
their
sins
forgiven
and
receive
the
same
blessings
as
those
who
go
and
fight
for
the
rescue
of
the
holy
land
those
jurymen
were
told
by
their
father
confessors
that
the
most
holy
father
the
pope
gregory
had
solemnly
and
infallibly
declared
that
the
killing
of
an
heretic
was
no
after
such
teachings
how
could
the
roman
catholic
jurymen
find
john
surratt
guilty
of
murder
for
killing
the
heretic
lincoln
the
jury
having
disagreed
no
verdict
could
be
given
the
government
was
forced
to
let
the
murderer
go
unpunished
but
when
the
irreconcilable
enemies
of
all
the
rights
and
liberties
of
men
were
congratulating
themselves
on
their
successful
efforts
to
save
the
life
of
john
surratt
the
god
of
heaven
was
stamping
again
on
their
faces
the
mark
of
murder
in
such
a
way
that
all
eyes
will
see
it
murder
will
out
is
a
truth
repeated
by
all
nations
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
it
is
the
knowledge
of
that
truth
which
has
sustained
me
in
my
long
and
difficult
researches
of
the
true
authors
of
the
assassination
of
lincoln
and
which
enables
me
to
present
to
the
world
a
fact
which
seems
almost
miraculous
to
show
the
complicity
of
the
priests
of
rome
in
the
murder
of
the
martyred
president
some
time
ago
i
providentially
met
the
rev
conwell
at
chicago
having
known
that
i
was
in
search
of
facts
about
the
assassination
of
abraham
lincoln
he
told
me
he
knew
one
of
those
facts
which
might
perhaps
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
of
my
researches
the
very
day
of
the
murder
he
said
he
was
in
the
roman
catholic
village
of
joseph
minnesota
state
when
at
about
six
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
he
was
told
by
a
roman
catholic
of
the
place
who
was
a
purveyor
of
a
great
number
of
priests
who
lived
in
that
town
where
they
have
a
monastery
that
the
state
secretary
seward
and
the
president
lincoln
had
just
been
killed
this
was
told
me
he
said
in
the
presence
of
a
most
respectable
gentleman
called
bennett
who
was
not
less
puzzled
than
me
as
there
were
no
railroad
lines
nearer
than
miles
nor
telegraph
offices
nearer
than
miles
from
that
place
we
could
not
see
how
such
news
was
spread
in
that
town
the
next
day
the
of
april
i
was
at
st
cloud
a
town
about
twelve
miles
distant
where
there
are
neither
railroad
nor
telegraph
i
said
to
several
people
that
i
had
been
told
in
the
priestly
village
of
joseph
by
a
roman
catholic
that
abraham
lincoln
and
the
secretary
seward
had
been
assassinated
they
answered
me
that
they
had
heard
nothing
about
it
but
the
next
sabbath
the
of
april
when
going
to
the
church
of
st
cloud
to
preach
a
friend
gave
me
a
copy
of
a
telegram
sent
to
him
on
the
saturday
reporting
that
abraham
lincoln
and
secretary
seward
had
been
assassinated
the
very
day
before
which
was
friday
the
at
but
how
could
the
roman
catholic
purveyor
of
the
priests
of
joseph
have
told
me
the
same
thing
before
several
witnesses
just
four
hours
before
its
occurrence
i
spoke
of
that
strange
thing
to
many
the
same
day
and
the
very
next
day
i
wrote
to
the
st
paul
press
under
the
heading
of
a
strange
sometime
later
the
editor
of
the
paul
pioneer
having
denied
what
i
had
written
on
that
subject
i
addressed
him
the
following
note
which
he
had
printed
and
which
i
have
kept
here
it
is
you
may
keep
it
as
an
infallible
proof
of
my
veracity
to
the
editor
of
the
paul
pioneer
you
assume
the
of
a
short
paragraph
addressed
by
me
to
the
paul
press
viz
a
strange
coincidence
at
friday
last
april
i
was
told
as
an
item
of
news
miles
west
of
this
place
that
lincoln
and
seward
had
been
assassinated
this
was
three
hours
after
i
had
heard
the
st
cloud
of
april
the
integrity
of
history
requires
that
the
above
coincidence
be
established
and
if
anyone
calls
it
in
question
then
proofs
more
ample
than
reared
their
sanguinary
shadows
to
comfort
a
traitor
can
now
be
given
respectfully
f
i
asked
that
gentleman
if
he
would
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
the
fact
under
oath
that
i
might
make
use
of
it
in
the
report
i
intended
to
publish
about
the
assassination
of
lincoln
and
he
kindly
granted
my
request
in
the
following
form

he
was

of
the

that
on
the

he
was
in
joseph
minnesota
and
reached
there
as
early
as
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
in
company
with
bennett
who
then

now

that

who
then
kept

of
joseph
told
affiant
that
president
lincoln
and
secretary
seward
were

that
it
was
not

than
six
o
clock
on

when
linneman
told

thereafter
bennett
came
in
the
hotel
and
i
told
him
that
linneman
said
the
president
lincoln
and
secretary
seward
were
assassinated
and
then
the
same
linneman
reported
the
same
conversation
to
bennett
in
my
presence
that
during
that
time
linneman
told
me
that
he
had
the
charge
of
the
friary
or
college
for
young
men
under
the
priests
who
were
studying
for
the
priesthood
at
joseph
that
there
was
a
large
multitude
of
this
kind
at
joseph
at
this
time
affiant
says
that
on
saturday
morning
april
he
went
to
st
cloud
a
distance
of
about
miles
and
reached
there
about
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
that
there
was
no
railroad
nor
telegraph
communication
to
st
cloud
when
he
arrived
at
st
cloud
he
told
haworth
the
that
he
had
been
told
that
president
lincoln
and
secretary
seward
had
been
assassinated
and
asked
if
it
was
true
he
further
told
henry
clay
wait
charles
gilman
who
was
afterwards
lieutenant
governor
of
minnesota
and
rev
tice
the
same
thing
and
inquired
of
them
if
they
had
any
such
views
and
they
replied
that
they
had
not
heard
anything
of
the
kind
affiant
says
that
on
sunday
morning
april
he
preached
in
st
cloud
and
on
the
way
to
the
church
a
copy
of
a
telegram
was
handed
him
stating
that
the
president
and
secretary
were
assassinated
friday
evening
at
about
o
clock
this
telegram
had
been
brought
to
st
cloud
by
gorton
who
had
reached
st
cloud
by
stage
and
this
was
the
first
intelligence
that
had
reached
st
cloud
of
the
event
affiant
says
further
that
on
monday
morning
april
he
furnished
the
press
a
paper
of
paul
a
statement
that
three
hours
before
the
event
took
place
he
had
been
informed
at
joseph
minnesota
that
the
president
had
been
assassinated
and
this
was
published
in
the
francis
asbury
conwell
subscribed
and
sworn
to
by
francis
conwell
before
me
a
notary
public
of
kankakee
county
illinois
at
chicago
cook
county
the
day
of
september
stephen
moore
notary
public
though
this
document
was
very
important
and
precious
to
me
i
felt
that
it
would
be
much
more
valuable
if
it
could
be
corroborated
by
the
testimonies
of
bennett
and
linneman
themselves
and
i
immediately
sent
a
magistrate
to
find
out
if
they
were
still
living
and
if
they
remembered
the
facts
of
the
sworn
declaration
of
rev
conwell
by
the
good
providence
of
god
both
of
these
gentlemen
were
found
living
and
both
gave
the
following
testimonies
state
of
minnesota
sterns
county
city
of
st
cloud
horace
bennett
being
sworn
deposes
and
says
that
he
is
aged
years
that
he
is
a
resident
of
st
cloud
minnesota
and
has
resided
in
this
county
since
that
he
is
acquainted
with
the
rev
conwell
who
was
chaplain
of
the
first
minnesota
regiment
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
that
on
the
of
april
he
was
in
joseph
minnesota
in
company
with
francis
conwell
that
they
reached
joseph
about
sundown
of
said
april
that
there
was
no
railroad
or
telegraph
communication
with
joseph
at
that
time
nor
nearer
than
avoka
about
miles
distant
that
affiant
on
reaching
the
hotel
kept
by
linneman
went
to
the
barn
while
rev
conwell
entered
the
hotel
and
shortly
afterward
affiant
had
returned
to
the
hotel
conwell
told
him
that
linneman
had
reported
to
him
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
that
linneman
was
present
and
substantiated
the
statement
that
on
saturday
morning
april
affiant
and
rev
conwell
came
to
st
cloud
and
reported
that
they
had
been
told
at
joseph
about
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
that
no
one
at
st
cloud
had
heard
of
the
event
at
this
time
that
the
first
news
of
the
event
which
reached
st
cloud
was
on
sunday
morning
april
when
the
news
was
brought
by
leander
gorton
who
had
just
come
up
from
avoka
minnesota
that
they
spoke
to
several
persons
of
st
cloud
concerning
the
matter
when
they
reached
there
on
sunday
morning
but
affiant
does
not
now
remember
who
those
different
persons
were
and
further
affiant
says
not
horace
bennett
sworn
before
me
and
subscribed
in
my
presence
this
of
october
andrew
robertson
notary
public
linneman
having
refused
to
swear
on
his
written
declaration
which
i
have
in
my
possession
i
take
only
from
it
what
refers
to
the
principal
fact
viz
that
three
or
four
hours
before
lincoln
was
assassinated
at
washington
the
of
april
the
fact
was
told
as
already
accomplished
in
the
priestly
village
of
joseph
minnesota
he
linneman
remembers
the
time
that
conwell
and
bennett
came
to
this
place
joseph
minnesota
on
friday
evening
before
the
president
was
killed
and
he
asked
them
if
they
had
heard
he
was
dead
and
they
replied
they
had
not
he
heard
this
rumor
in
his
store
from
people
who
came
in
and
out
but
he
can
not
remember
from
whom
october
linneman
i
present
here
to
the
world
a
fact
of
the
greatest
gravity
and
that
fact
is
so
well
authenticated
that
it
can
not
allow
even
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
three
or
four
hours
before
lincoln
was
murdered
in
washington
the
of
april
that
murder
was
not
only
known
by
some
one
but
it
was
circulated
and
talked
of
in
the
streets
and
in
the
houses
of
the
priestly
and
romish
town
of
joseph
minnesota
the
fact
is
undeniable
the
testimonies
are
unchallengeable
and
there
were
no
railroad
nor
any
telegraph
communication
nearer
than
or
miles
from
the
nearest
station
to
joseph
naturally
every
one
asked
how
could
such
news
spread
where
is
the
source
of
such
a
rumor
linneman
who
is
a
roman
catholic
tells
us
that
though
he
heard
this
from
many
in
his
store
and
in
the
streets
he
does
not
remember
the
name
of
a
single
one
who
told
him
that
and
when
we
hear
this
from
him
we
understand
why
he
did
not
dare
to
swear
upon
it
and
shrunk
from
the
idea
of
perjuring
himself
for
everyone
feels
that
his
memory
can
not
be
so
poor
as
that
when
he
remembers
so
well
the
name
of
the
two
strangers
conwell
and
bennett
to
whom
he
had
announced
the
assassination
of
lincoln
just
seventeen
years
before
but
if
the
memory
of
linneman
is
so
deficient
on
that
subject
we
can
help
him
and
tell
him
with
mathematical
accuracy
you
got
the
news
from
your
priests
of
joseph
the
conspiracy
which
cost
the
life
of
the
martyred
president
was
prepared
by
the
priests
of
washington
in
the
house
of
mary
surratt
no
street
the
priests
of
joseph
were
often
visiting
washington
and
boarding
probably
at
surratt
s
as
the
priests
of
washington
were
often
visiting
their
brother
priests
at
joseph
those
priests
of
washington
were
in
daily
communication
with
their
priests
of
joseph
they
were
their
intimate
friends
there
were
no
secrets
among
them
as
there
are
no
secrets
among
priests
they
are
the
members
of
the
same
body
the
branches
of
the
same
tree
the
details
of
the
murder
as
the
day
selected
for
its
commission
were
as
well
known
among
the
priests
of
joseph
as
they
were
among
those
of
washington
the
death
of
lincoln
was
such
a
glorious
event
for
those
priests
that
infamous
apostate
lincoln
who
baptized
in
the
holy
church
had
rebelled
against
her
broken
his
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
pope
taken
the
very
day
of
his
baptism
and
lived
the
life
of
an
apostate
that
infamous
lincoln
who
had
dared
to
fight
against
the
confederacy
of
the
south
after
the
vicar
of
christ
had
solemnly
declared
that
their
cause
was
just
legitimate
and
holy
that
bloody
tyrant
that
godless
and
infamous
man
was
to
receive
at
last
the
just
chastisement
of
his
crimes
the
of
april
what
glorious
news
how
could
the
priests
conceal
such
a
joyful
event
from
their
bosom
friend
linneman
he
was
their
confidential
man
he
was
their
purveyor
he
was
their
right
hand
man
among
the
faithful
of
joseph
they
thought
that
they
would
be
guilty
of
a
want
of
confidence
in
their
bosom
friend
if
they
did
not
tell
him
all
about
the
glorious
event
of
that
great
day
but
of
course
they
requested
him
not
to
mention
their
names
if
he
would
spread
the
joyful
news
among
the
devoted
roman
catholics
who
almost
exclusively
formed
the
people
of
joseph
linneman
has
honorably
and
faithfully
kept
his
promise
never
to
reveal
their
names
and
we
have
in
our
hand
the
authentic
testimonies
signed
by
him
that
though
somebody
the
of
april
told
him
that
president
lincoln
was
assassinated
he
does
not
know
who
told
him
that
but
there
is
not
a
man
of
sound
judgment
who
will
have
any
doubt
about
that
fact
the
of
april
the
priests
of
rome
knew
and
circulated
the
death
of
lincoln
four
hours
before
its
occurrence
in
their
roman
catholic
town
of
joseph
minnesota
but
they
could
not
circulate
it
without
knowing
it
and
they
could
not
know
it
without
belonging
to
the
band
of
conspirators
who
assassinated
president
lincoln
chapter
lxii
deputation
of
two
priests
sent
by
the
people
and
the
bishops
of
canada
to
persuade
us
to
submit
to
the
will
of
the
deputies
acknowledge
publicly
that
the
bishop
is
wrong
and
that
we
are
peace
sake
i
consent
to
withdraw
from
the
contest
on
certain
conditions
accepted
by
the
of
those
deputies
turns
false
to
his
promises
and
betrays
us
to
be
put
at
the
head
of
my
last
interview
with
him
and
brassard
when
alone
on
my
knees
in
the
presence
of
god
on
the
of
january
i
took
the
resolution
of
opposing
the
acts
of
simony
and
tyranny
of
bishop
o
regan
i
was
far
from
understanding
the
logical
consequences
of
my
struggle
with
that
high
dignitary
my
only
object
was
to
force
him
to
be
honest
just
and
christian
towards
my
people
that
people
with
me
had
left
their
country
and
had
bid
an
eternal
adieu
to
all
that
was
dear
to
them
in
canada
in
order
to
live
in
peace
in
illinois
under
what
we
then
considered
the
holy
authority
of
the
church
of
christ
but
we
were
absolutely
unwilling
to
be
slaves
of
any
man
in
the
land
of
liberty
if
any
one
at
that
hour
could
have
shown
me
that
this
struggle
would
lead
me
to
a
complete
separation
from
the
church
of
rome
i
would
have
shrank
from
the
task
my
only
ambition
was
to
purify
my
church
from
the
abuses
which
one
after
the
other
had
crept
everywhere
about
her
as
noxious
weeds
i
felt
that
those
abuses
were
destroying
the
precious
truths
which
jesus
christ
and
his
apostles
have
revealed
to
us
it
seemed
to
me
that
was
a
duty
imposed
upon
every
priest
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
blot
from
the
face
of
our
church
the
scandals
which
were
the
fruits
of
the
iniquities
and
tyranny
of
the
bishops
i
had
most
sincerely
offered
myself
to
god
for
this
work
from
the
beginning
however
i
had
a
presentiment
that
the
power
of
the
bishops
would
be
too
much
for
me
and
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
crush
me
but
my
hope
was
that
when
i
should
have
fallen
others
would
take
my
place
and
fight
the
battles
of
the
lord
till
a
final
victory
would
bring
the
church
back
to
the
blessed
days
when
she
was
the
spotless
spouse
of
the
lamb
the
great
and
providential
victory
i
had
gained
at
urbana
had
strengthened
my
conviction
that
god
was
on
my
side
and
that
he
would
protect
me
so
long
as
my
only
motives
were
in
the
interest
of
truth
and
righteousness
it
seemed
in
a
word
that
i
could
not
fail
so
long
as
i
should
fight
against
the
official
lies
tyrannies
superstitions
and
deceits
which
the
bishops
had
everywhere
in
the
united
states
and
canada
substituted
in
the
place
of
the
gospel
the
primitive
laws
of
the
church
and
the
teachings
of
the
holy
fathers
in
the
autumn
of
our
struggle
against
the
bishop
of
chicago
had
taken
proportions
which
could
not
have
been
anticipated
either
by
me
or
by
the
roman
catholic
hierarchy
of
america
the
whole
press
of
the
united
states
and
canada
both
political
and
religious
were
discussing
the
causes
and
the
probable
results
of
the
contest
at
first
the
bishops
were
indignant
at
the
conduct
of
my
lord
o
regan
they
had
seen
with
pleasure
that
a
priest
from
his
own
diocese
would
probably
force
him
to
be
more
cautious
and
less
scandalous
in
his
public
and
private
dealings
with
the
clergy
and
the
people
but
they
also
hoped
that
i
should
be
paralyzed
by
the
sentence
of
excommunication
and
that
the
people
frightened
by
these
fulminations
would
withdraw
the
support
they
had
at
first
given
me
they
were
assured
by
spink
that
i
would
lose
my
suit
at
urbana
and
should
when
lodged
in
the
penitentiary
become
powerless
to
do
any
mischief
in
the
church
but
their
confidence
was
soon
changed
into
dismay
when
they
saw
that
the
people
laughed
at
the
excommunication
that
i
had
gained
my
suit
and
that
i
was
triumphing
on
that
very
from
which
no
priest
since
luther
and
knox
had
come
out
unscathed
everywhere
the
sound
of
alarm
was
heard
and
i
was
denounced
as
a
rebel
and
schismatic
the
whole
body
of
the
bishops
prepared
to
hurl
their
most
terrible
fulminations
at
my
devoted
head
but
before
taking
their
last
measure
to
crush
me
a
supreme
effort
was
made
to
show
us
what
they
considered
our
errors
the
rev
brassard
curate
of
longueuil
and
rev
isaac
desaulnier
president
of
hyacinthe
college
were
sent
by
the
people
and
bishops
of
canada
to
show
me
what
they
called
the
scandal
of
my
proceedings
and
press
me
to
submit
to
the
will
of
the
bishop
by
respecting
the
sentence
of
excommunication
the
choice
of
those
two
priests
was
very
wise
they
were
certainly
the
most
influential
that
could
be
sent
brassard
had
not
only
been
my
teacher
at
the
college
of
nicolet
but
my
benefactor
as
i
have
already
said
when
the
want
of
means
in
had
forced
me
to
leave
the
college
and
bid
adieu
to
my
mother
and
my
young
brothers
in
order
to
go
to
a
very
distant
land
in
search
of
a
position
he
stopped
me
on
the
road
of
exile
and
brought
me
back
to
the
college
and
along
with
the
rev
leprohon
he
paid
all
my
expenses
to
the
end
of
my
studies
he
had
loved
me
since
as
his
own
child
and
i
cherished
and
respected
him
as
my
own
father
the
other
mons
desaulnier
had
been
my
in
the
college
from
to
and
we
had
been
united
during
the
whole
of
that
period
as
well
as
since
by
the
bonds
of
the
sincerest
esteem
and
friendship
they
arrived
at
anne
on
november
i
heard
of
their
coming
only
a
few
minutes
before
their
arrival
and
nothing
can
express
the
joy
i
felt
at
the
news
the
confidence
i
had
in
their
honesty
and
friendship
gave
me
at
once
the
hope
that
they
would
soon
see
the
justice
and
holiness
of
our
cause
and
they
would
bravely
take
our
side
against
our
aggressor
but
they
had
very
different
sentiments
sincerely
believing
that
i
was
an
unmanageable
schismatic
who
was
creating
an
awful
scandal
in
the
church
they
had
not
only
been
forbidden
by
the
bishops
to
sleep
in
my
house
but
also
have
any
friendly
and
christian
communication
with
me
with
no
hatred
against
me
they
were
yet
filled
with
horror
at
the
thought
that
i
should
be
so
scandalous
a
priest
and
so
daring
as
to
trouble
the
peace
and
destroy
the
unity
of
the
church
on
their
way
from
canada
to
anne
they
had
often
been
told
that
i
was
not
the
same
man
as
they
knew
me
formerly
to
be
and
that
i
had
become
sour
and
gloomy
abusive
insolent
and
haughty
that
also
i
would
insult
them
and
perhaps
advise
the
people
to
turn
them
away
from
my
premises
as
men
who
had
no
business
to
meddle
in
our
affairs
they
were
pleasantly
disappointed
however
when
they
saw
me
running
to
meet
them
as
far
as
i
could
see
them
to
press
them
to
my
heart
with
the
most
sincere
marks
of
affection
and
joy
i
told
them
that
all
the
treasures
of
california
brought
to
my
house
would
not
make
me
half
so
happy
as
i
was
made
by
their
presence
i
at
once
expressed
my
hope
that
they
were
the
messengers
sent
by
god
to
bring
us
peace
and
put
an
end
to
the
deplorable
state
of
things
which
was
the
cause
of
their
long
journey
remarking
that
they
were
covered
with
mud
i
invited
them
to
go
to
their
sleeping
rooms
to
wash
and
refresh
themselves
sleeping
rooms
sleeping
rooms
said
desaulnier
but
our
written
instructions
from
the
bishops
who
sent
us
forbid
us
to
sleep
here
on
account
of
your
brassard
answered
i
must
tell
you
my
dear
desaulnier
a
thing
which
i
have
kept
secret
till
now
after
reading
that
prohibition
of
sleeping
here
i
said
to
the
bishop
that
if
he
would
put
such
a
restraint
upon
me
he
might
choose
another
one
to
come
here
i
requested
him
to
let
us
both
act
according
to
our
conscience
and
common
sense
when
we
should
be
with
chiniquy
and
my
conscience
and
common
sense
tells
me
that
we
can
not
begin
our
mission
of
peace
by
insulting
a
man
who
gives
us
such
a
friendly
and
christian
reception
the
people
of
canada
have
chosen
us
as
their
deputies
because
we
are
the
most
sincere
friends
of
chiniquy
it
is
by
keeping
that
character
that
we
will
best
fulfill
our
sacred
and
solemn
duties
i
accept
with
pleasure
the
sleeping
room
offered
desaulnier
rejoined
i
accept
it
also
for
i
did
not
come
here
to
insult
my
best
friend
but
to
save
these
kind
words
of
my
guests
added
to
the
joy
i
experienced
at
their
coming
i
told
them
if
you
are
here
to
obey
the
voice
of
your
conscience
and
the
dictates
of
your
common
sense
there
is
a
glorious
task
before
you
you
will
soon
find
that
the
people
and
priest
of
anne
have
also
done
nothing
but
listened
to
the
voice
of
their
honest
conscience
and
followed
the
laws
of
common
sense
in
their
conduct
towards
the
bishop
but
i
added
this
is
not
the
time
to
explain
my
position
but
the
time
to
wash
your
dusty
faces
and
refresh
yourselves
here
are
your
rooms
make
yourselves
at
after
supper
which
had
been
spent
in
the
most
pleasant
way
and
without
any
allusion
to
our
troubles
they
handed
me
the
letters
addressed
to
me
by
the
bishops
of
montreal
london
and
toronto
to
induce
me
to
submit
to
my
superior
and
offer
me
the
assurance
of
their
most
sincere
friendship
and
devotedness
if
i
would
obey
desaulnier
then
said
now
my
dear
chiniquy
we
have
been
sent
here
by
the
people
and
bishops
of
canada
to
take
you
away
from
the
bottomless
abyss
into
which
you
have
fallen
with
your
people
we
have
only
one
day
and
two
nights
to
spend
here
we
must
lose
no
time
but
begin
at
once
to
fulfill
our
solemn
i
answered
if
i
have
fallen
into
a
bottomless
abyss
as
you
say
and
that
you
will
draw
me
out
of
it
not
only
god
and
men
will
bless
you
but
i
will
also
forever
bless
you
for
your
charity
the
first
thing
however
you
have
to
do
here
is
to
see
if
i
am
really
fallen
with
my
people
into
that
bottomless
abyss
of
which
you
but
are
you
not
excommunicated
quickly
rejoined
desaulnier
and
notwithstanding
that
excommunication
have
you
not
continued
to
say
your
mass
preach
and
hear
the
confessions
of
your
people
are
you
not
then
fallen
into
that
state
of
irregularity
and
schism
which
separate
you
entirely
from
the
church
and
to
which
the
pope
alone
can
restore
you
no
my
dear
desaulnier
i
answered
i
am
no
more
excommunicated
than
you
are
for
the
simple
reason
that
an
act
of
excommunication
which
is
not
signed
and
certified
is
a
public
nullity
unworthy
of
any
attention
here
is
the
act
of
the
excommunication
which
makes
so
much
noise
in
the
world
examine
it
yourself
look
if
it
is
signed
by
the
bishop
or
any
one
else
you
know
consider
with
attention
if
it
is
certified
by
and
i
handed
him
the
document
after
he
had
examined
it
and
turned
it
every
way
for
more
than
half
an
hour
with
brassard
without
saying
a
word
he
at
last
broke
the
silence
and
said
if
i
had
not
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
could
never
have
believed
that
a
bishop
can
play
such
a
sacrilegious
comedy
in
the
face
of
the
world
you
have
several
times
published
it
in
the
press
but
i
confess
that
your
best
friends
and
i
among
the
rest
did
not
believe
you
it
could
not
enter
our
minds
that
a
bishop
should
be
so
devoid
i
do
not
say
of
every
principle
of
religion
but
of
the
most
common
honesty
as
to
have
proclaimed
before
the
whole
world
that
you
were
excommunicated
when
he
had
to
offer
us
only
that
ridiculous
piece
of
rag
to
support
his
assertion
but
in
the
name
of
common
sense
why
is
it
that
he
has
not
signed
his
sentence
of
excommunication
or
got
it
signed
and
countersigned
by
some
authorized
people
when
it
is
so
evident
that
he
wanted
to
excommunicate
you
his
reason
for
not
putting
his
name
nor
the
name
of
any
known
person
at
the
bottom
of
that
excommunication
is
very
clear
i
answered
though
our
bishop
is
one
of
the
most
accomplished
rogues
of
illinois
he
is
still
more
a
coward
than
a
rogue
i
had
threatened
to
bring
him
before
the
civil
court
of
the
country
if
he
dared
to
destroy
my
character
by
a
sentence
of
interdict
or
excommunication
and
he
found
that
the
only
way
to
save
himself
in
the
same
time
that
he
was
outraging
me
was
not
to
sign
that
paper
he
thereby
took
away
from
me
the
power
of
prosecuting
him
for
the
first
thing
i
would
have
to
do
in
a
prosecution
in
that
case
would
be
to
prove
the
signature
of
the
bishop
where
could
i
find
a
witness
who
would
swear
that
this
is
his
signature
would
you
swear
it
yourself
my
dear
desaulnier
oh
no
for
surely
it
is
not
his
signature
nor
that
of
his
grand
vicar
or
secretary
but
without
going
any
further
added
he
we
must
confess
to
you
that
we
have
talked
to
the
bishop
when
passing
through
chicago
asking
him
if
he
had
made
any
public
or
private
inquest
against
you
and
if
he
had
found
you
guilty
of
any
crime
as
he
felt
embarrassed
by
our
questions
we
told
him
that
it
was
in
our
public
character
as
deputies
of
the
bishops
and
people
of
canada
towards
you
that
we
were
putting
to
him
those
questions
that
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
know
all
about
your
public
and
private
character
when
we
were
coming
to
press
you
to
reconcile
yourself
to
your
bishop
he
answered
that
he
had
never
made
any
inquest
about
you
though
you
had
requested
him
several
times
to
do
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
was
persuaded
that
you
were
one
of
his
best
priests
your
only
defect
he
said
was
a
spirit
of
stubbornness
and
want
of
respect
and
obedience
to
your
superior
and
your
meddling
with
the
dealings
of
his
diocesans
with
which
you
had
no
business
he
told
us
also
that
you
refused
to
go
to
kahokia
but
his
face
became
so
red
and
his
tongue
was
so
strangely
lisping
when
he
said
that
that
i
suspected
that
it
was
a
falsehood
and
we
have
now
before
our
eyes
that
document
signed
by
four
unimpeachable
witnesses
that
it
was
more
than
a
was
a
lie
he
proffered
another
lie
also
we
see
it
now
when
he
said
that
he
had
signed
himself
the
act
of
excommunication
for
surely
this
is
not
his
handwriting
such
conduct
from
a
bishop
is
very
strange
if
you
would
appeal
to
the
pope
and
go
to
rome
with
such
documents
in
hand
against
that
bishop
you
would
have
an
easy
victory
over
him
for
the
canons
of
the
church
are
clear
and
unanimous
on
that
subject
a
bishop
who
pronounces
such
a
grave
sentence
against
a
priest
and
makes
use
of
false
signatures
to
certify
his
sentences
is
himself
suspended
and
excommunicated
for
a
whole
brassard
added
can
not
we
confess
to
chiniquy
that
the
opinion
of
the
bishops
of
canada
is
that
bishop
o
regan
is
a
perfect
rogue
and
that
if
he
chiniquy
would
submit
at
once
under
protest
to
those
unjust
sentences
and
appeal
to
the
pope
he
would
gain
his
cause
and
soon
be
reinstated
by
a
public
decree
of
his
our
discussion
about
the
troubles
i
had
had
and
the
best
way
to
put
an
end
to
them
having
kept
us
up
till
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
without
being
able
to
come
to
any
satisfactory
issue
we
adjourned
to
the
next
day
and
went
to
take
some
rest
after
a
short
prayer
the
of
november
at
after
breakfast
and
a
short
walk
in
our
public
square
to
breathe
the
pure
air
and
enjoy
the
fine
scenery
of
our
beautiful
hill
of
anne
we
shut
ourselves
up
in
my
study
and
resumed
the
discussion
of
the
best
plans
of
putting
an
end
to
the
existing
difficulties
to
show
them
my
sincere
desire
of
stopping
those
noisy
and
scandalous
struggles
without
compromising
the
sacred
principles
which
had
guided
me
from
the
beginning
of
our
troubles
i
consented
to
sacrifice
my
position
as
pastor
of
anne
provided
brassard
would
be
installed
in
my
place
it
was
decided
however
that
i
should
remain
with
him
as
his
vicar
and
help
in
the
management
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
affairs
of
the
colony
the
promise
was
given
me
that
on
that
condition
the
bishop
would
withdraw
his
sentence
give
back
to
the
of
chicago
the
church
he
had
taken
away
from
them
put
a
priest
at
the
head
of
the
congregation
and
forget
and
forgive
what
he
might
consider
our
irregular
conduct
towards
him
after
we
should
have
signed
the
following
document
to
his
lordship
bishop
of
chicago
my
lord
my
writings
and
actions
in
opposition
to
your
orders
have
since
a
few
months
given
some
scandals
and
caused
some
people
to
think
that
i
would
rather
prefer
to
be
separated
from
our
holy
church
than
to
submit
to
your
authority
i
hasten
to
express
the
regret
i
feel
for
such
acts
and
writings
and
to
show
to
the
world
and
to
you
my
bishop
my
firm
desire
to
live
and
die
a
catholic
i
hasten
to
write
to
your
lordship
that
i
submit
to
your
sentence
and
that
i
promise
hereafter
to
exercise
the
holy
ministry
only
with
your
permission
in
consequence
i
respectfully
request
your
lordship
to
withdraw
the
censures
and
interdicts
you
have
pronounced
against
me
and
those
who
have
had
any
spiritual
communication
with
me
i
am
my
lord
your
devoted
son
in
christ
chiniquy
it
was
eleven
o
clock
at
night
when
i
consented
to
sign
this
document
which
was
to
be
handed
to
the
bishop
and
have
any
value
only
on
the
above
conditions
the
two
deputies
were
besides
themselves
with
joy
at
the
success
of
their
mission
and
at
my
readiness
to
sacrifice
myself
for
the
sake
of
peace
mons
desaulnier
said
now
we
see
evidently
that
chiniquy
has
been
right
with
his
people
from
the
beginning
that
he
never
meant
to
create
a
schism
and
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
rebellious
party
to
defy
the
authority
of
the
church
if
the
bishop
does
not
want
to
live
in
peace
with
the
people
and
pastor
of
anne
after
such
a
sacrifice
we
will
tell
him
that
it
is
not
chiniquy
but
bishop
o
regan
who
wants
a
will
appeal
to
the
will
go
with
chiniquy
and
we
will
easily
get
there
the
removal
of
that
bishop
from
the
diocese
of
brassard
confirmed
that
sentence
and
added
that
he
also
would
accompany
me
to
rome
to
be
the
witness
of
my
innocence
and
the
bad
conduct
of
the
bishop
he
added
that
it
would
not
take
him
a
week
to
raise
twice
the
amount
of
money
in
montreal
we
would
require
to
go
to
rome
after
thanking
them
for
what
they
had
done
and
said
i
asked
desaulnier
if
he
would
be
brave
enough
to
repeat
before
my
whole
people
what
he
had
just
said
before
me
and
brassard
in
the
presence
of
god
surely
i
would
be
most
happy
to
repeat
before
your
whole
people
that
it
is
impossible
to
find
fault
with
you
in
what
you
have
done
till
now
but
you
know
very
well
i
will
never
have
such
an
opportunity
for
it
is
now
o
clock
at
night
your
people
are
soundly
sleeping
and
i
must
start
morning
at
six
o
clock
to
take
the
chicago
train
at
kankakee
at
i
answered
all
right
we
knelt
together
to
make
a
short
prayer
and
i
led
them
to
their
rooms
wishing
them
refreshing
sleep
after
the
hard
work
of
the
day
ten
minutes
later
i
was
in
the
village
knocking
at
the
doors
of
six
of
my
most
respectable
parishioners
and
telling
them
please
do
not
lose
a
moment
go
with
your
fastest
horse
to
such
and
such
a
part
of
the
colony
knock
at
every
door
and
tell
the
people
to
be
at
the
church
at
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
hear
with
their
own
ears
what
the
deputies
from
canada
have
to
say
about
past
struggles
with
the
bishop
of
chicago
tell
them
to
be
punctual
at
o
clock
in
their
pews
where
the
deputies
will
address
them
words
which
they
must
hear
at
any
a
little
before
five
the
next
morning
desaulnier
full
of
surprise
and
anxiety
knocked
at
my
door
and
said
chiniquy
do
you
not
hear
the
strange
noise
of
buggies
and
carriages
which
seem
to
be
coming
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
what
does
it
mean
has
your
people
become
crazy
to
come
to
church
at
this
dark
hour
so
long
before
the
dawn
of
day
what
what
i
answered
i
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
i
have
heard
nothing
yet
what
do
you
mean
by
this
noise
of
carriages
and
buggies
around
the
chapel
are
you
dreaming
no
i
am
not
dreaming
he
answered
not
only
do
i
hear
the
noise
of
a
great
many
carriages
wagons
and
buggies
but
though
it
is
pretty
dark
i
see
several
hundred
of
them
around
the
chapel
i
hear
the
voices
of
a
great
multitude
of
men
women
and
even
children
putting
questions
to
each
other
and
giving
answers
which
i
can
not
understand
they
make
such
a
noise
by
their
laughing
and
jokes
can
you
tell
me
what
this
means
i
have
never
been
so
puzzled
in
my
i
answered
him
do
you
not
see
that
you
are
dreaming
let
me
dress
myself
that
i
may
go
and
see
something
of
that
strange
and
awful
dream
brassard
though
a
little
more
calm
than
desaulnier
was
not
himself
without
some
anxiety
at
the
strange
noise
of
that
multitude
of
carriages
horses
and
people
around
my
house
and
chapel
at
such
an
hour
knocking
at
my
door
he
said
please
chiniquy
explain
that
strange
mystery
do
that
people
come
to
play
us
some
bad
trick
and
punish
us
for
intruding
in
their
affairs
be
quiet
i
answered
my
dear
friends
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
that
good
and
intelligent
people
do
you
not
remember
that
last
night
a
few
minutes
before
o
clock
desaulnier
said
that
he
would
be
honest
and
brave
enough
to
repeat
before
my
whole
people
what
he
had
said
before
you
and
me
and
in
the
presence
of
god
i
suppose
that
some
of
the
angels
of
heaven
have
heard
those
words
and
have
carried
them
this
night
to
every
family
inviting
them
to
be
here
at
the
chapel
that
they
might
hear
from
your
own
lips
what
you
think
of
the
grand
and
glorious
battle
they
are
fighting
in
this
distant
land
for
the
principles
of
truth
and
justice
as
the
gospel
secures
them
to
every
disciple
of
well
well
said
desaulnier
there
is
only
one
chiniquy
in
the
world
to
take
me
in
such
a
trap
and
there
is
only
one
people
under
heaven
to
do
what
this
people
is
doing
here
i
would
never
have
given
you
that
answer
had
i
not
been
morally
sure
that
i
would
never
have
had
an
opportunity
to
fulfill
it
who
would
think
you
would
play
me
such
a
trick
but
he
added
though
i
know
that
this
will
terribly
compromise
me
before
certain
parties
it
is
too
late
to
retract
and
i
will
fulfill
my
it
is
impossible
to
express
my
own
joy
and
the
joy
of
that
noble
people
when
they
heard
from
the
very
lips
of
those
deputies
that
after
spending
a
whole
day
and
two
nights
in
examining
all
that
had
been
done
by
their
pastor
and
by
them
in
that
solemn
and
fearful
contest
they
declared
that
they
had
not
broken
any
law
of
god
nor
of
his
holy
church
and
that
they
had
kept
themselves
in
the
very
way
prescribed
by
the
canons
tears
of
joy
were
rolling
down
every
cheek
when
they
heard
desaulnier
telling
them
which
brassard
confirmed
after
that
the
bishop
had
no
possible
right
to
interdict
their
pastor
since
he
had
told
them
that
he
was
one
of
his
best
priests
and
that
they
had
done
well
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
an
act
of
excommunication
which
was
a
sham
and
a
sacrilegious
comedy
not
having
been
signed
nor
certified
by
any
known
person
both
deputies
said
mr
brassard
will
be
your
pastor
and
chiniquy
as
his
vicar
will
remain
in
your
midst
he
has
signed
an
act
of
submission
which
we
have
found
sufficient
on
the
condition
that
the
bishop
will
let
you
live
in
peace
and
withdraw
the
sentence
he
says
he
has
fulminated
against
you
if
he
does
not
accept
those
conditions
we
will
tell
him
it
is
not
chiniquy
but
you
who
wants
a
schism
and
we
will
go
with
chiniquy
to
rome
to
plead
his
cause
and
prove
his
innocence
before
his
after
this
we
all
knelt
to
thank
and
bless
god
and
never
people
went
back
to
their
homes
with
more
cheerful
hearts
than
the
people
of
anne
on
that
morning
of
the
of
november
at
six
o
clock
desaulnier
was
on
his
way
back
to
chicago
to
present
my
conditional
act
of
submission
to
the
bishop
and
press
him
in
the
name
of
the
bishop
of
canada
and
in
the
name
of
all
the
most
sacred
interests
of
the
church
to
accept
the
sacrifice
and
the
submission
of
the
people
of
anne
and
to
give
them
the
peace
they
wanted
and
were
purchasing
at
such
a
price
the
rev
brassard
had
remained
with
me
waiting
for
a
letter
from
the
bishop
to
accompany
me
and
put
the
last
seal
to
our
reconciliation
the
next
day
he
received
the
following
note
from
desaulnier
bishopric
of
chicago
the
rev
brassard
monsieur
it
is
advisable
and
indispensable
that
you
should
come
here
with
chiniquy
as
soon
as
possible
in
consequence
i
expect
you
both
day
after
in
order
to
settle
that
matter
definitely
respectfully
yours
isaac
desaulnier
after
reading
that
letter
with
brassard
i
said
do
you
not
feel
that
these
cold
words
mean
nothing
good
i
regret
that
you
have
not
gone
with
desaulnier
to
the
bishop
you
know
the
levity
and
weakness
of
his
character
always
bold
with
his
words
but
soft
as
wax
at
the
least
pressure
which
he
feels
my
fear
is
that
the
bulldog
tenacity
of
my
lord
o
regan
has
frightened
him
and
all
his
courage
and
bravados
have
melted
away
before
the
fierce
temper
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
but
let
us
go
be
sure
however
my
dear
brassard
that
if
the
bishop
does
not
accept
you
to
remain
at
the
head
of
this
colony
to
protect
and
guide
it
no
consideration
whatever
will
induce
me
to
betray
my
people
and
let
them
become
the
prey
of
the
wolves
which
want
to
devour
we
arrived
at
the
illinois
central
depot
of
chicago
the
at
about
desaulnier
was
there
waiting
for
us
he
was
as
pale
as
a
dead
man
the
marks
of
cain
and
judas
were
on
his
face
having
taken
him
at
a
short
distance
from
the
crowd
i
asked
him
what
news
he
answered
the
news
is
that
you
and
brassard
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
your
bags
and
go
away
from
anne
to
canada
the
bishop
is
unwilling
to
make
any
arrangements
with
you
he
wants
me
to
be
the
pastor
of
anne
and
he
wants
you
with
brassard
to
go
quietly
back
to
canada
and
tell
the
bishops
to
mind
their
own
and
what
has
become
of
the
promise
you
have
given
me
and
to
my
people
to
go
with
me
and
brassard
to
rome
if
the
bishop
refused
the
proposed
arrangements
you
had
fixed
yourselves
tat
tat
tat
answered
he
the
bishop
does
not
care
a
straw
about
your
going
or
not
going
to
rome
he
has
put
me
as
his
grand
vicar
at
the
head
of
the
colony
of
anne
from
which
you
must
go
in
the
shortest
time
now
desaulnier
i
answered
you
are
a
traitor
and
a
judas
and
if
you
want
to
have
the
pay
of
judas
i
advise
you
to
go
to
anne
there
you
will
receive
what
you
deserve
the
beauty
and
importance
of
that
great
colony
has
tempted
you
and
you
have
sold
me
to
the
bishop
in
order
to
become
a
grand
vicar
and
eat
the
fruits
of
the
vine
i
have
planted
there
but
you
will
soon
see
your
mistake
if
you
have
any
pity
for
yourself
i
advise
you
never
to
put
your
feet
into
that
place
any
desaulnier
answered
the
bishop
will
not
make
any
arrangements
with
you
unless
you
retract
publicly
what
you
have
written
against
him
on
account
of
his
taking
possession
of
the
church
of
the
of
chicago
and
you
must
publish
in
the
press
that
he
was
right
and
honest
in
what
he
did
in
that
my
dear
brassard
i
said
can
i
make
such
a
declaration
conscientiously
and
honorably
that
venerable
man
answered
me
you
can
not
consent
to
such
a
desaulnier
i
said
do
you
hear
brassard
and
your
conscience
if
you
have
any
tell
you
the
same
thing
if
you
take
sides
against
me
with
a
man
whom
you
have
yourself
declared
yesterday
to
be
a
sacrilegious
thief
you
are
not
better
than
he
is
go
and
work
with
him
as
for
me
i
go
back
into
the
midst
of
my
dear
and
noble
people
of
what
will
you
do
there
answered
desaulnier
when
the
bishop
has
forbidden
you
to
remain
what
will
i
do
i
answered
i
will
teach
those
true
disciples
of
jesus
christ
to
shun
and
despise
the
tyrants
and
the
traitors
even
though
wearing
a
mitre
or
a
square
bonnet
un
bonnet
quarre
go
traitor
and
finish
your
judas
work
adieu
i
then
threw
myself
into
the
arms
of
brassard
who
was
almost
speechless
suffocated
in
his
sobs
and
tears
i
pressed
him
to
my
heart
and
said
adieu
my
dear
brassard
go
back
to
canada
and
tell
my
friends
how
the
cowardice
and
ambition
of
that
traitor
has
ruined
the
hopes
we
had
of
putting
an
end
to
this
deplorable
state
of
affairs
i
go
back
among
my
brethren
of
anne
with
more
determination
than
ever
to
protect
them
against
the
tyranny
and
impiety
of
our
despotic
rulers
it
will
be
more
easy
than
ever
to
show
them
that
the
son
of
god
has
not
redeemed
us
on
the
cross
that
we
might
be
the
slaves
of
those
heartless
traders
in
souls
i
will
more
earnestly
than
ever
teach
my
people
to
shun
the
modern
gospel
of
the
bishops
in
order
to
follow
the
old
gospel
of
jesus
christ
as
the
only
hope
and
life
of
our
poor
fallen
brassard
wanted
to
say
something
but
his
voice
was
suffocated
by
his
sobs
the
only
words
he
could
utter
when
pressing
me
to
his
heart
were
adieu
dear
friend
adieu
chapter
lxiii
desaulnier
is
named
vicar
general
of
chicago
to
crush
people
more
united
than
ever
to
defend
their
of
the
people
of
chicago
to
the
bishops
and
to
the
of
the
bishop
of
montreal
against
me
and
my
brassard
forced
against
his
conscience
to
condemn
answer
to
writes
to
beg
my
pardon
it
was
evident
that
the
betrayal
of
desaulnier
would
be
followed
by
new
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
bishop
to
crush
us
two
new
priests
were
sent
from
canada
mailloux
vicar
general
and
campo
to
strengthen
his
hands
and
press
the
people
to
submit
brassard
wrote
me
from
canada
in
december
all
the
bishops
are
preparing
to
hurl
their
thunders
against
you
and
your
people
on
account
of
your
heroic
resistance
to
the
tyranny
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
i
have
told
them
the
truth
but
they
don
t
want
to
know
it
my
lord
bourget
told
me
positively
that
you
must
be
forced
at
any
cost
to
yield
to
the
authority
of
your
bishop
and
he
has
threatened
to
excommunicate
me
if
i
tell
the
people
what
i
know
of
the
shameful
conduct
of
desaulnier
if
i
were
alone
i
would
not
mind
his
excommunication
and
would
speak
the
truth
but
such
a
sentence
against
me
would
kill
my
poor
old
mother
i
hope
you
will
not
find
fault
with
me
if
i
remain
absolutely
mute
i
pray
you
to
consider
this
letter
confidential
you
know
very
well
the
trouble
you
would
put
me
into
by
its
the
french
canadians
of
chicago
saw
at
once
that
their
bishop
strengthened
by
the
support
of
desaulnier
would
be
more
than
ever
obstinate
in
his
determination
to
crush
them
they
thought
that
the
best
way
to
force
him
to
do
them
justice
was
to
publish
a
manifesto
of
their
grievances
against
him
and
make
a
public
appeal
to
all
the
bishops
of
the
united
states
and
even
to
the
pope
on
the
of
january
chicago
was
requested
by
them
to
publish
the
following
document
at
a
public
meeting
of
the
french
and
canadian
catholics
of
chicago
held
in

hall
of

these

living
in
chicago
editors
of
the
tribune
you
allow
a
thousand
voices
from
the
dead
to
speak
to
the
public
through
your
valuable
paper
everybody
in
chicago
knows
that
a
few
years
ago
there
was
a
flourishing
congregation
of
french
people
coming
from
france
and
canada
in
this
city
they
had
their
priest
their
church
their
religious
meeting
all
that
is
now
dispersed
and
destroyed
the
present
bishop
of
chicago
has
breathed
his
deadly
breath
upon
us
instead
of
coming
to
us
as
a
father
he
came
as
a
savage
enemy
instead
of
helping
us
as
a
friend
he
has
put
us
down
as
a
revengeful
foe
he
has
done
the
very
contrary
to
which
was
commanded
him
by
the
gospel
the
bruised
reed
he
shall
not
break
and
the
smoking
flash
he
shall
not
instead
of
guiding
us
with
the
cross
of
the
meek
jesus
he
has
ruled
over
us
with
an
iron
rod
every
sunday
the
and
generous
irish
go
to
their
church
to
hear
the
voice
of
their
priest
in
their
english
language
the
intelligent
germans
have
their
pastors
to
address
them
in
their
mother
tongue
the
french
people
are
the
only
ones
now
who
have
no
priest
and
no
church
they
are
the
only
ones
whose
beautiful
language
is
prohibited
and
which
is
not
heard
from
any
pulpit
in
chicago
and
is
it
from
lack
of
zeal
and
liberality
ah
no
we
take
the
whole
city
of
chicago
as
a
witness
of
what
we
have
done
there
was
not
in
chicago
a
little
church
than
the
french
canadian
church
called
louis
but
alas
we
have
been
turned
out
of
it
by
our
very
bishop
as
he
is
now
publishing
many
stories
to
contradict
that
fact
we
owe
to
ourselves
and
to
our
children
to
raise
from
the
tomb
where
bishop
o
regan
has
buried
us
a
voice
to
tell
the
truth
as
soon
as
bishop
o
regan
came
to
chicago
he
was
told
that
the
french
priest
was
too
popular
that
his
church
was
attended
not
only
by
his
french
canadian
people
but
that
many
irish
and
germans
were
going
daily
to
him
for
their
religious
duties
it
was
whispered
in
the
ears
of
his
rt
reverence
that
on
account
of
this
many
dollars
and
cents
were
going
to
the
french
priest
which
would
be
better
stored
in
his
rt
reverence
s
purse
till
that
time
the
bishop
was
not
in
appearance
taking
much
trouble
about
us
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
there
were
dollars
and
cents
at
stake
we
had
the
honor
to
occupy
his
thoughts
day
and
night
here
are
the
facts
the
undeniable
public
facts
he
the
bishop
began
by
sending
for
our
priest
and
telling
him
that
he
had
to
prepare
himself
to
be
removed
from
chicago
to
some
other
place
as
soon
as
we
knew
that
determination
a
deputation
was
sent
to
his
rt
reverence
to
get
the
promise
that
we
would
get
another
french
priest
and
we
received
from
him
the
assurance
that
our
just
request
would
be
granted
but
the
next
sunday
an
irish
priest
having
been
sent
to
officiate
instead
of
a
french
one
we
sent
a
deputation
to
ask
him
where
the
french
priest
was
that
he
had
promised
us
he
answered
that
we
ought
to
take
any
priest
we
could
get
and
be
this
short
and
sharp
answer
raised
our
french
blood
and
we
began
speaking
more
boldly
to
his
reverence
who
got
up
and
walked
through
the
room
in
a
rage
saying
some
half
dozen
times
you
insult
me
but
seeing
that
we
were
a
fearless
people
and
determined
to
have
no
other
priest
but
one
whom
we
could
understand
he
at
last
promised
us
again
a
french
priest
if
we
were
ready
to
pay
the
debt
of
our
church
and
we
said
we
would
pay
them
but
our
verbal
promise
was
nothing
to
his
reverence
he
immediately
wrote
an
agreement
though
it
was
sunday
and
we
signed
it
but
to
attain
sooner
or
later
his
object
he
imposed
upon
that
unfortunate
priest
a
condition
that
he
knew
no
christian
could
obey
this
condition
was
that
he
should
not
receive
in
his
church
any
one
but
the
french
this
was
utterly
impossible
as
many
irish
germans
and
american
catholics
had
been
in
the
habit
for
years
past
of
coming
to
our
church
it
was
impossible
to
turn
them
out
at
once
we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
help
our
priest
in
the
matter
by
taking
all
the
seats
in
the
church
against
the
will
of
the
respectable
people
of
the
different
nations
who
had
occupied
them
for
years
finding
themselves
turned
out
of
the
church
and
unable
to
conceive
the
reason
of
so
gross
an
insult
from
a
people
they
said
to
us
have
we
not
paid
for
our
seats
in
your
church
till
this
day
double
the
rent
if
you
like
we
are
ready
to
pay
for
it
but
for
god
s
sake
permit
us
to
come
and
pray
with
you
at
the
foot
of
the
same
we
explained
to
them
the
tyrannical
orders
of
the
bishop
and
they
too
commenced
cursing
the
bishop
and
the
ship
that
brought
him
over
they
continued
however
to
come
to
our
church
though
they
had
no
seat
they
attended
divine
service
in
the
aisles
of
the
church
and
we
did
not
like
to
disturb
them
but
our
feelings
were
too
christian
for
the
bishop
he
kept
a
watch
over
our
priest
and
of
course
found
out
that
he
was
receiving
many
who
were
forbidden
by
him
to
attend
our
religious
meetings
the
bishop
then
thought
once
more
of
his
dear
french
priest
so
he
came
in
person
to
his
house
and
asked
him
if
he
had
kept
his
orders
the
priest
answered
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
obey
such
orders
and
remain
a
christian
he
acknowledged
that
in
many
instances
he
had
been
obliged
by
the
laws
of
charity
to
give
religious
help
to
some
who
were
not
french
people
well
then
answered
the
bishop
from
this
very
moment
i
silence
you
and
i
forbid
you
the
functions
of
priest
in
my
the
poor
trembling
priest
thunderstruck
could
not
say
a
word
he
went
to
some
friends
to
relate
what
had
just
happened
him
and
he
was
advised
by
them
to
go
back
to
the
bishop
immediately
to
beg
the
privilege
of
remaining
at
the
head
of
his
congregation
till
lent
was
over
the
bishop
said
i
will
consent
to
your
request
if
you
pay
me
one
hundred
i
will
give
you
the
sum
as
soon
as
i
can
collect
it
and
will
give
you
my
note
for
thirty
days
answered
the
priest
i
want
the
money
cash
down
said
the
bishop
go
to
some
of
your
friends
you
can
easily
collect
that
the
poor
priest
went
away
in
search
of
the
almighty
dollars
but
he
could
not
find
them
as
soon
as
he
wished
and
did
not
return
to
his
lordship
that
day
the
bishop
started
that
night
for
louis
but
he
did
not
forget
his
dear
french
people
in
his
long
journey
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
louis
he
wrote
to
his
grand
vicar
rev
dunn
that
the
french
priest
pay
him
or
remain
suspended
this
goodwill
of
the
bishop
for
our
spiritual
welfare
and
his
paternal
love
for
our
purses
did
not
fail
to
strike
us
our
priest
made
a
new
effort
that
very
day
he
went
to
see
an
old
friend
who
had
been
absent
from
town
for
some
time
and
related
to
him
his
sad
position
this
old
friend
rofinot
seeing
that
he
could
redeem
a
priest
for
so
little
a
sum
for
the
priest
had
collected
part
of
it
himself
immediately
proceeded
with
the
priest
to
the
house
of
very
reverend
dunn
with
the
money
in
hand
to
satisfy
the
bishop
but
alas
that
bargain
did
not
last
very
long
for
as
soon
as
the
bishop
returned
the
watch
that
he
had
left
behind
him
performed
his
duty
well
and
told
him
that
the
french
priest
was
going
on
as
before
so
the
poor
priest
had
to
go
again
to
the
bishop
to
explain
his
conduct
but
this
time
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
officiating
any
longer
under
such
a
tyrant
he
left
us
to
fight
the
hardest
battles
ourselves
against
the
bishop
as
the
church
and
the
house
of
our
priest
were
on
leased
grounds
the
lease
had
to
be
renewed
or
the
buildings
removed
we
went
to
the
bishop
who
advised
us
to
buy
a
lot
and
remove
the
church
on
it
and
sell
the
house
to
help
pay
for
the
lot
suspecting
nothing
wrong
in
that
advice
we
followed
it
we
bargained
for
a
lot
agreed
to
sell
the
house
and
went
to
report
our
progress
but
we
were
going
too
fast
the
bishop
must
stop
us
or
he
would
be
frustrated
in
his
calculations
for
he
had
a
lot
himself
to
put
the
church
on
he
opposed
our
removing
our
church
by
telling
us
that
there
was
another
lot
adjoining
the
one
we
had
bargained
for
and
that
we
must
buy
it
also
we
went
immediately
and
bought
the
lot
on
ninety
days
time
but
he
objected
to
this
again
saying
that
he
would
not
allow
us
to
touch
the
church
unless
we
had
the
whole
lot
paid
for
and
put
the
deed
in
his
hands
and
that
the
deed
should
be
made
to
himself
personally
this
had
the
effect
desired
by
the
bishop
we
had
collected
all
the
money
that
could
be
collected
then
in
our
small
congregation
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
do
any
more
so
we
concluded
to
give
up
the
battle
the
bishop
then
went
on
took
the
money
we
had
sold
the
house
for
a
catholic
lady
whose
husband
had
bought
the
house
had
subscribed
one
hundred
dollars
for
removing
the
church
providing
the
bishop
would
promise
that
it
would
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
french
and
attended
by
a
french
priest
the
bishop
proffered
again
to
that
lady
the
lie
which
he
had
so
often
uttered
to
us
everywhere
even
from
the
altar
that
upon
his
word
of
bishop
it
should
remain
a
french
church
and
that
they
should
have
a
french
priest
this
we
should
call
lie
number
one
he
then
moved
the
church
to
another
lot
of
his
own
sent
an
irish
priest
to
officiate
in
it
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
made
the
congregation
which
is
now
irish
pay
for
the
lot
the
moving
and
repairing
of
the
church
and
he
takes
quarterly
the
revenues
which
are
no
less
than
a
year
this
is
the
way
we
have
been
swindled
out
of
our
church
of
the
house
of
our
priest
and
of
our
all
by
the
tyrant
bishop
o
regan
and
when
a
french
priest
visits
our
city
he
forbids
him
to
address
us
in
our
mother
tongue
this
is
the
way
we
french
catholics
as
a
society
have
been
blotted
out
of
the
book
of
the
living
and
when
rev
father
chiniquy
has
publicly
accused
bishop
o
regan
of
having
deprived
us
most
unjustly
of
our
church
he
has
proffered
a
truth
which
has
as
many
witnesses
as
there
are
catholics
and
protestants
in
chicago
we
know
well
that
bishop
o
regan
is
proclaiming
that
he
has
not
deprived
us
of
our
church
that
if
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
irish
it
is
because
the
irish
and
not
the
french
built
it
this
is
lie
number
two
which
can
be
proven
by
more
than
a
thousand
we
would
like
to
know
if
he
has
forgotten
the
agreement
mentioned
above
which
he
made
us
sign
in
bargaining
for
a
french
priest
he
has
the
receipts
for
every
cent
that
was
due
up
to
the
time
he
took
possession
of
our
church
he
then
proffered
these
words
to
the
french
gentlemen
who
brought
him
the
receipts
it
takes
the
french
to
collect
money
quick
these
hard
times
being
in
the
winter
we
must
also
add
that
we
french
people
have
paid
for
the
very
vestments
that
the
bishop
uses
in
his
cathedral
which
he
has
taken
from
our
church
but
he
uses
them
only
on
some
high
feasts
thinking
too
much
of
stolen
property
to
use
them
on
a
common
day
will
it
be
out
of
place
here
to
say
that
the
cathedral
of
chicago
was
built
by
the
french
and
that
the
lot
which
it
is
built
on
was
given
by
a
frenchman
it
is
very
reluctantly
that
we
expose
all
these
facts
before
the
eyes
of
the
public
but
having
waited
patiently
during
two
long
years
and
having
used
all
the
influence
we
could
command
in
france
and
canada
to
no
purpose
we
must
resort
to
the
sympathy
of
the
public
for
justice
through
the
free
press
of
the
united
states
resolutions
that
the
right
rev
o
regan
bishop
of
chicago
has
entirely
lost
the
confidence
of
the
french
and
canadian
population
of
chicago
since
he
has
taken
away
from
us
our
church
that
the
right
rev
o
regan
has
published
a
base
slander
against
the
french
and
canadian
population
of
chicago
when
he
said
he
took
our
church
from
our
hands
on
the
pretence
that
we
could
not
pay
for
it
that
the
right
rev
o
regan
having
said
to
our
deputies
who
went
to
inquire
from
him
by
what
right
he
was
taking
our
church
from
us
to
give
it
to
another
congregation
i
have
the
right
to
do
what
i
like
with
your
church
and
your
church
properties
i
can
sell
them
and
put
the
money
in
my
pocket
and
go
where
i
please
with
it
has
assumed
a
power
too
tyrannical
to
be
obeyed
by
a
christian
and
a
free
people
that
the
nature
of
the
different
suits
which
the
right
rev
o
regan
has
had
before
the
civil
courts
of
this
state
and
which
he
has
almost
invariably
lost
have
proved
to
the
whole
people
of
illinois
that
he
is
quite
unworthy
of
the
position
he
holds
in
the
catholic
church
that
the
right
rev
o
regan
is
here
publicly
accused
of
being
guilty
of
simony
for
having
extorted
from
a
priest
to
give
him
permission
to
officiate
and
administer
the
sacraments
among
us
that
the
right
rev
o
regan
in
forbidding
the
irish
and
german
catholics
to
communicate
with
the
french
catholic
church
and
allowing
the
french
and
canadians
to
communicate
with
the
irish
and
german
churches
has
acted
with
a
view
to
deprive
the
french
church
of
religious
fees
and
other
donations
which
acts
we
consider
unjust
and
against
the
spirit
of
the
church
and
more
resembling
a
mercantile
transaction
than
a
christian
work
that
the
french
and
canadian
people
of
illinois
have
seen
with
feelings
of
grief
and
surprise
that
the
rev
desaulnier
has
made
himself
the
humble
valet
of
the
merciless
and
shameless
persecutor
of
his
countrymen
that
the
rev
chiniquy
pastor
of
anne
deserves
the
gratitude
of
every
catholic
of
illinois
for
having
the
first
put
a
stop
to
the
rapacious
tyranny
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
that
the
french
catholics
of
chicago
are
determined
to
give
all
support
in
their
power
to
the
rev
chiniquy
in
his
struggle
against
the
bishop
of
chicago
that
a
printed
copy
of
these
resolutions
be
sent
to
every
bishop
and
archbishop
of
the
united
states
and
canada
that
they
may
see
the
necessity
of
giving
to
the
church
of
illinois
a
bishop
more
worthy
of
that
high
position
that
a
copy
of
these
resolutions
be
sent
to
his
holiness
pius
that
he
may
be
incited
to
make
inquiries
about
the
humiliated
position
of
the
church
in
illinois
since
the
present
bishop
is
among
us
that
the
independence
and
liberty
loving
press
of
the
united
states
be
requested
to
publish
the
above
address
and
resolutions
all
over
the
country
p
rofinot
president
david
franchere
that
cry
of
more
than
two
thousand
roman
catholics
of
chicago
which
was
reproduced
by
almost
the
whole
press
of
illinois
and
the
united
states
fell
as
a
thunderbolt
upon
the
head
of
my
lord
o
regan
and
desaulnier
they
wrote
to
all
bishops
of
america
to
hasten
to
their
rescue
and
for
several
months
the
pulpits
of
the
roman
catholic
churches
had
no
other
mission
than
to
repeat
the
echoes
of
the
episcopal
fulminations
hurled
against
my
devoted
head
many
bishop
s
letters
and
mandements
were
published
denouncing
me
and
my
people
as
infamous
schismatics
whose
pride
and
obstinancy
were
troubling
the
peace
of
the
church
but
the
most
bitter
of
all
these
was
a
letter
from
my
lord
bourget
bishop
of
montreal
who
thought
the
best
if
not
the
only
way
to
force
the
people
to
desert
me
was
by
forever
destroying
my
honor
but
he
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
into
the
pit
he
had
dug
for
me
in
the
miserable
girl
he
had
associated
with
himself
to
satisfy
his
implacable
hatred
was
dead
but
he
had
still
in
hand
the
lying
accusations
obtained
from
her
against
me
having
probably
destroyed
her
sworn
recantation
written
by
the
jesuit
father
schneider
and
not
having
the
least
idea
that
i
had
kept
three
other
sworn
copies
of
the
thought
he
could
safely
publish
that
i
was
a
degraded
man
who
had
been
driven
from
canada
by
him
after
being
convicted
of
some
enormous
crime
and
interdicted
this
declaration
was
brought
before
the
public
for
the
first
time
by
him
with
an
hypocritical
air
of
compassion
and
mercy
for
me
which
added
much
to
the
deadly
effect
he
expected
to
produce
by
it
here
are
his
own
words
addressed
to
the
people
of
bourbonnais
and
through
them
to
the
whole
world
i
must
tell
you
that
on
the
of
september
i
withdrew
all
his
powers
and
interdicted
him
for
reasons
which
i
gave
him
in
my
letter
addressed
to
him
a
letter
which
he
has
probably
kept
let
him
publish
that
letter
if
he
finds
that
i
have
persecuted
him
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
when
i
read
this
ignominious
act
of
perfidy
on
the
part
of
that
high
dignitary
it
seemed
incredible
and
surpassed
anything
i
had
ever
seen
even
in
bishop
o
regan
i
can
not
say
however
that
it
took
me
entirely
by
surprise
for
i
had
anticipated
it
when
father
schneider
asked
me
why
i
had
taken
four
sworn
copies
of
the
recantation
of
the
unfortunate
girl
whose
tears
of
regret
were
flowing
before
us
i
told
him
that
i
knew
so
much
of
the
meanness
and
perfidy
of
bishop
bourget
that
i
thought
he
might
destroy
the
copy
we
were
sending
him
in
order
to
pierce
me
again
with
his
poisonous
arrows
whilst
if
i
kept
three
other
copies
one
for
him
one
for
brassard
and
one
for
myself
i
would
have
nothing
to
fear
i
am
convinced
that
my
merciful
god
knew
the
malice
of
that
bishop
against
me
and
gave
me
that
wisdom
to
save
me
i
immediately
sent
him
through
the
press
the
following
answer
to
monsignor
bourget
anne
april
my
lord
your
letter
of
the
of
march
you
assure
the
public
that
you
have
interdicted
me
a
few
days
before
my
leaving
canada
for
the
united
states
and
you
invite
me
to
give
the
reasons
of
that
sentence
i
will
satisfy
you
on
the
of
september
i
found
a
letter
on
my
table
from
you
telling
me
that
you
had
suspended
me
from
my
ecclesiastical
offices
on
account
of
a
great
crime
that
i
had
committed
and
of
which
i
was
accused
but
the
name
of
the
accuser
was
not
given
nor
the
nature
of
the
crime
i
immediately
went
to
see
you
and
protesting
my
innocence
i
requested
you
to
give
me
the
name
of
my
accusers
and
allow
me
to
be
confronted
by
them
promising
that
i
would
prove
my
innocence
you
refused
to
grant
my
request
then
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
with
tears
in
the
name
of
god
i
requested
you
again
to
allow
me
to
meet
my
accusers
and
prove
my
innocence
you
remained
deaf
to
my
prayer
and
unmoved
by
my
tears
you
repulsed
me
with
a
malice
and
air
of
tyranny
which
i
thought
impossible
in
you
during
the
hours
after
this
sentiments
of
an
inexpressible
wrath
crossed
my
mind
i
tell
it
to
you
frankly
in
that
terrible
hour
i
would
have
preferred
to
be
at
the
feet
of
a
heathen
priest
whose
knife
would
have
slaughtered
me
on
his
altars
to
appease
his
infernal
gods
rather
than
be
at
the
feet
of
a
man
who
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
and
under
the
mask
of
the
gospel
should
dare
to
commit
such
a
cruel
act
you
had
taken
away
my
had
destroyed
me
with
the
most
infamous
you
had
refused
me
every
means
of
justification
you
had
taken
under
your
protection
the
cowards
who
were
stabbing
me
in
the
dark
though
it
is
hard
to
repeat
i
must
tell
it
here
publicly
i
cursed
you
on
that
horrible
day
with
a
broken
heart
i
went
to
the
jesuit
college
and
i
showed
the
wounds
of
my
bleeding
soul
to
the
noble
friend
who
was
generally
my
confessor
the
rev
father
schneider
the
director
of
the
college
after
three
days
having
providentially
got
some
reasons
to
suspect
who
was
the
author
of
my
destruction
i
sent
some
one
to
ask
her
to
come
to
the
college
without
mentioning
my
name
when
she
was
in
the
parlor
i
said
to
father
schneider
you
knew
the
horrible
iniquity
of
the
bishop
against
me
with
the
lying
words
of
a
prostitute
he
has
tried
to
destroy
me
but
please
come
and
be
the
witness
of
my
when
in
the
presence
of
that
unfortunate
female
i
told
her
you
are
in
the
presence
of
god
almighty
and
two
of
his
priests
they
will
be
the
witnesses
of
what
you
say
speak
the
truth
say
in
the
presence
of
god
and
this
venerable
priest
if
i
have
ever
been
guilty
of
what
you
have
accused
me
to
the
at
these
words
the
unfortunate
female
burst
into
tears
she
concealed
her
face
in
her
hands
and
with
a
voice
half
suffocated
with
her
sobs
she
answered
no
sir
you
are
not
guilty
of
that
sin
confess
here
another
truth
i
said
to
her
is
it
not
true
you
have
come
to
confess
to
me
more
with
the
desire
to
tempt
me
than
to
reconcile
yourself
to
god
she
said
yes
sir
that
is
the
then
i
said
again
continue
to
say
the
truth
and
i
will
forgive
you
and
god
also
will
forgive
your
iniquity
is
it
not
through
revenge
for
having
failed
in
your
criminal
designs
that
you
have
tried
to
destroy
me
by
false
accusation
to
the
bishop
yes
sir
it
was
the
only
reason
which
has
induced
me
to
accuse
you
falsely
and
all
i
say
here
at
least
in
substance
has
been
heard
written
and
signed
by
the
right
rev
schneider
one
of
your
priests
and
the
present
director
of
the
jesuit
college
that
venerable
priest
is
still
living
in
montreal
let
the
people
of
canada
go
and
interrogate
him
let
the
people
of
canada
also
go
to
the
rev
brassard
who
has
in
his
hands
an
authenticated
copy
of
that
declaration
your
lordship
gives
the
public
to
understand
that
i
was
disgraced
by
that
sentence
some
days
before
i
left
canada
for
illinois
allow
me
to
give
you
my
reasons
for
differing
from
you
in
this
matter
there
is
a
canon
law
of
the
church
which
says
if
a
censure
is
unjust
and
unfounded
let
the
man
against
whom
the
sentence
has
been
passed
pay
no
attention
to
it
for
before
god
and
his
church
no
unjust
sentence
can
bring
any
injury
against
anyone
let
the
one
against
whom
such
unfounded
and
unjust
judgment
has
been
pronounced
even
take
no
step
to
annul
it
for
it
is
a
nullity
by
you
know
very
well
that
the
sentence
you
had
passed
against
me
was
null
and
void
for
many
good
reasons
that
it
was
founded
on
a
false
testimony
father
schneider
is
there
ready
to
prove
it
to
you
if
you
have
any
doubt
the
second
reason
i
have
to
believe
that
you
had
yourself
considered
your
sentence
a
nullity
and
that
i
was
not
suspended
by
it
from
my
ecclesiastical
dignity
and
honor
is
founded
on
a
good
testimony
i
testimony
of
your
lordship
himself
a
few
hours
before
my
leaving
canada
for
the
united
states
i
went
to
ask
your
benediction
which
you
gave
me
with
every
mark
of
kindness
i
then
asked
your
lordship
to
tell
me
frankly
if
i
had
to
leave
with
the
impression
that
i
was
disgraced
in
his
mind
you
gave
me
the
assurance
of
the
contrary
then
i
told
you
that
i
wanted
to
have
a
public
and
irrefutable
testimony
of
your
esteem
written
with
your
own
hand
and
you
gave
me
the
following
letter
montreal
canada
october
sir
ask
me
permission
to
leave
my
diocese
to
go
and
offer
your
services
to
the
bishop
of
chicago
as
you
belong
to
the
diocese
of
quebec
i
think
it
belongs
to
my
lord
the
archbishop
to
give
you
the
exeat
you
wish
as
for
me
i
can
not
but
thank
you
for
your
labours
among
us
and
i
wish
you
in
return
the
most
abundant
blessings
from
heaven
you
shall
ever
be
in
my
remembrance
and
in
my
heart
and
i
hope
that
divine
providence
will
permit
me
at
a
future
time
to
testify
all
the
gratitude
i
owe
you
meanwhile
i
remain
your
very
humble
and
obedient
servant
bishop
of
montreal
chiniquy
priest
i
then
asked
you
to
give
me
some
other
tangible
token
of
your
esteem
which
i
might
show
everywhere
i
should
go
you
answered
that
you
would
be
happy
to
give
me
one
and
you
said
what
do
you
wish
i
wish
i
said
to
have
a
chalice
from
your
hands
to
offer
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
the
rest
of
my
you
answered
i
will
do
that
with
pleasure
and
you
gave
an
order
to
one
of
your
priests
to
bring
you
a
chalice
that
you
might
give
it
to
me
but
that
priest
had
not
the
key
of
the
box
containing
the
sacred
vases
that
key
was
in
the
hands
of
another
priest
who
was
absent
for
a
few
hours
i
had
not
the
time
to
wait
the
hour
of
the
departure
of
the
trains
had
come
i
told
you
please
my
lord
send
that
chalice
to
rev
brassard
of
longueuil
who
will
forward
it
to
me
in
a
few
days
to
and
the
next
day
one
of
your
secretaries
went
to
rev
brassard
and
gave
him
the
chalice
you
had
promised
me
which
is
still
in
my
hands
and
the
rev
brassard
is
there
still
living
to
be
the
witness
of
what
i
say
and
to
bring
that
fact
to
your
memory
if
you
have
forgotten
it
well
my
lord
i
do
believe
that
a
bishop
will
never
give
a
chalice
to
a
priest
to
say
mass
when
he
knows
that
that
priest
is
interdicted
and
the
best
proof
that
you
know
very
well
that
i
was
not
interdicted
by
your
rash
and
unjust
sentence
is
that
you
gave
me
that
chalice
as
a
token
of
your
esteem
and
of
my
honesty
etc
respectfully
chiniquy
ten
thousand
copies
of
this
exposure
of
the
depravity
of
the
bishop
were
published
in
montreal
i
asked
the
whole
people
of
canada
to
go
to
the
rev
schneider
and
to
the
rev
brassard
to
know
the
truth
and
many
went
the
bishop
remained
confounded
it
was
proved
that
he
had
committed
against
me
a
most
outrageous
act
of
tyranny
and
perfidy
and
that
i
was
perfectly
innocent
and
honest
and
that
he
knew
it
in
the
very
hour
that
he
tried
to
destroy
my
character
probably
the
bishop
of
montreal
had
destroyed
the
copy
of
the
declaration
of
the
poor
girl
he
had
employed
and
thinking
that
this
was
the
only
copy
of
her
declaration
of
my
innocence
and
honesty
he
thought
he
could
speak
of
the
interdict
after
i
was
a
protestant
but
in
that
he
was
cruelly
mistaken
for
as
i
have
already
said
by
the
great
mercy
of
god
three
other
authenticated
copies
had
been
kept
one
by
the
rev
schneider
himself
another
by
the
rev
brassard
another
by
one
whom
it
is
not
necessary
to
mention
and
then
he
had
no
suspicion
that
the
revelation
of
his
unchristian
conduct
and
of
his
determination
to
destroy
me
with
the
false
oath
of
a
prostitute
were
in
the
hands
of
too
many
people
to
be
denied
the
bishop
of
chicago
whom
i
met
a
few
days
after
told
me
what
i
was
well
aware
of
before
that
such
a
sentence
was
a
perfect
nullity
in
every
way
and
it
was
a
disgrace
only
for
those
who
were
blind
enough
to
trample
under
their
feet
the
laws
of
god
and
men
to
satisfy
their
bad
a
few
days
after
the
publication
of
that
letter
in
canada
brassard
wrote
me
your
last
letter
has
completely
unmasked
our
poor
bishop
and
revealed
to
the
world
his
malice
injustice
and
hypocrisy
he
felt
so
confounded
by
it
that
he
has
been
three
days
without
being
able
to
eat
or
drink
anything
and
three
nights
without
sleeping
every
one
says
that
the
chastisement
you
have
given
him
is
a
terrible
one
when
it
is
in
the
face
of
the
whole
world
but
he
deserved
when
i
received
that
last
friendly
letter
from
brassard
on
the
of
april
i
was
far
from
suspecting
that
on
the
of
the
same
month
i
should
read
in
the
press
of
canada
the
following
lines
from
him
roch
de
l
achigan
le
auvril
messieurs
request
you
to
insert
the
following
lines
in
your
journal
as
some
people
suspect
that
i
am
favoring
the
schism
of
chiniquy
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
say
that
i
have
never
encouraged
him
by
my
words
or
writings
in
that
schism
i
must
say
that
last
november
when
i
went
to
anne
accompanied
by
desaulnier
superior
of
hyacinthe
college
my
only
object
was
to
persuade
that
old
friend
to
leave
the
bad
ways
in
which
he
was
walking
and
in
chicago
i
pressed
him
to
put
himself
in
a
canonical
way
i
more
than
any
one
else
deplore
the
fall
of
a
man
whom
i
confess
i
loved
much
but
for
the
sake
of
whom
i
will
not
sacrifice
the
sacred
ties
of
catholic
unity
i
hope
that
all
the
canadians
who
were
attached
to
chiniquy
when
he
was
united
to
the
church
will
withdraw
from
him
in
horror
of
his
schism
for
before
anything
else
we
must
be
truly
and
faithfully
catholic
however
we
have
a
duty
to
perform
towards
the
man
who
has
fulfilled
such
a
holy
mission
in
our
midst
by
establishing
the
society
of
temperance
it
is
to
call
back
with
our
prayers
that
stray
sheep
who
has
left
the
true
pastor
s
fold
i
request
all
journals
to
reproduce
this
declaration
truly
yours
moses
brassard
pastor
the
editors
of
the
du
i
felt
that
there
was
not
a
line
not
a
sentiment
of
brassard
in
that
letter
it
smelt
bishop
bourget
s
hand
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
i
thought
however
it
was
my
duty
to
address
him
the
following
answer
anne
kankakee
county
illinois
april
my
dear
brassard
have
just
received
your
letter
of
the
but
no
i
will
not
call
it
a
letter
it
will
be
better
named
a
bitter
tear
and
a
sad
wail
of
a
heart
as
good
as
it
is
noble
and
generous
you
have
been
a
witness
how
the
people
and
missionary
of
anne
have
been
betrayed
by
desaulnier
you
were
at
my
side
as
my
friend
and
father
when
this
traitor
said
to
me
as
well
as
to
my
brethren
sign
this
act
of
submission
to
the
bishop
of
chicago
this
act
alone
is
enough
to
make
him
withdraw
the
sentence
which
fills
your
canadian
friends
with
anxiety
if
the
bishop
does
not
give
you
the
place
you
want
and
if
he
does
not
withdraw
the
excommunication
after
having
been
presented
with
this
act
i
will
tell
him
it
is
neither
the
pastor
nor
the
people
of
anne
who
wish
a
schism
they
have
done
that
which
religion
and
honor
commanded
to
prove
it
it
is
you
who
wish
your
tears
were
mingled
with
mine
and
the
incense
of
your
prayer
ascended
with
those
of
my
brethren
when
on
the
of
november
desaulnier
said
to
the
people
of
anne
you
can
not
be
blamed
for
what
you
have
done
since
the
beginning
of
your
difficulties
with
your
you
were
a
witness
that
our
first
condition
to
the
signing
of
the
act
which
you
and
desaulnier
presented
to
us
was
that
you
should
be
the
pastor
of
anne
and
that
i
should
remain
with
you
as
long
as
you
would
find
it
to
the
interest
of
my
colony
you
know
that
he
gave
me
his
word
of
honor
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
that
if
the
bishop
would
not
give
us
peace
after
the
signing
of
the
act
he
desaulnier
would
go
with
us
to
louis
and
even
to
rome
to
plead
my
cause
and
show
the
iniquity
and
unbearable
tyranny
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
did
he
not
assure
us
that
in
case
the
bishop
should
refuse
to
accept
the
act
of
submission
we
had
signed
your
mission
to
anne
was
finished
and
that
you
both
would
return
to
canada
after
your
voyage
to
louis
is
it
not
true
that
when
in
chicago
in
reply
to
our
question
what
news
desaulnier
said
you
have
only
to
take
your
bags
and
both
return
to
canada
at
desaulnier
denies
all
those
facts
with
an
impudence
of
which
he
alone
is
capable
you
are
my
only
witness
before
our
canada
which
wishes
and
has
a
right
to
know
the
truth
in
this
matter
i
took
you
as
my
witness
and
you
replied
in
many
of
your
letters
that
you
could
not
say
the
truth
without
compromising
yourself
is
not
this
an
acknowledgment
that
we
priests
of
jesus
christ
are
groaning
under
the
weight
of
the
most
frightful
tyranny
and
that
we
are
in
the
power
of
men
who
threaten
our
honor
and
life
if
we
dare
speak
the
truth
in
favor
of
an
oppressed
brother
and
this
is
the
system
that
proclaims
itself
as
the
divine
and
ineffable
news
which
the
messiah
brought
to
the
world
and
this
abominable
oppression
this
system
of
deceit
is
the
religion
which
the
son
of
the
god
of
truth
justice
and
mercy
has
established
to
save
the
world
this
is
the
of
the
church
of
christ
no
you
do
not
believe
that
my
dear
brassard
neither
do
i
never
did
and
never
will
believe
it
they
tell
us
it
is
for
the
greater
good
of
the
church
that
they
act
thus
that
it
is
to
preserve
the
respect
which
is
due
to
the
holy
catholic
hierarchy
that
they
take
those
extreme
measures
against
the
people
of
anne
but
i
have
carefully
studied
the
laws
of
the
church
upon
these
great
questions
and
i
see
they
say
precisely
the
contrary
i
see
that
the
catholic
church
said
to
us
in
the
church
there
is
no
arbitrary
the
censures
are
null
when
they
have
been
pronounced
against
sins
which
have
not
been
never
receive
any
accusation
against
a
priest
which
has
not
been
proven
by
two
or
three
if
a
sentence
is
visibly
unjust
the
condemned
must
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
for
before
god
and
his
church
no
unjust
sentence
can
injure
any
the
unjust
excommunication
is
not
binding
neither
before
god
nor
the
people
when
that
people
know
its
injustice
because
the
holy
ghost
can
not
abandon
those
who
have
not
deserved
you
wish
me
to
act
according
to
the
canons
of
the
church
i
have
already
told
you
that
if
i
had
been
interdicted
on
the
of
august
i
would
have
been
able
to
appeal
from
that
sentence
but
i
had
not
i
had
fifteen
days
to
consider
how
could
i
have
appealed
from
a
sentence
which
had
not
been
pronounced
what
witness
could
i
bring
against
a
fact
which
i
knew
had
never
taken
place
but
you
will
say
the
excommunication
should
it
not
give
you
some
anxiety
not
the
thomas
said
positively
that
no
excommunication
of
which
the
injustice
is
known
by
the
people
ought
not
to
prevent
a
priest
from
exercising
his
ministry
among
them
they
will
perhaps
say
but
where
did
the
people
get
the
right
to
judge
in
such
things
thomas
must
have
believed
that
the
people
had
that
right
since
he
said
it
thomas
was
neither
a
heretic
nor
a
schismatic
for
believing
these
things
why
then
should
i
be
one
for
having
a
thought
spoken
and
acted
according
to
the
doctrine
of
whom
the
church
has
named
the
angel
of
the
school
besides
that
you
know
that
the
excommunication
was
a
nullity
from
want
of
being
signed
the
reason
of
this
surprise
about
the
right
which
the
people
had
to
exercise
its
judgment
upon
this
question
is
that
lately
the
bishops
have
not
only
stripped
the
priests
but
also
the
people
of
the
holy
and
just
rights
which
jesus
christ
had
given
them
those
who
have
carefully
studied
the
history
of
the
church
in
the
first
centuries
know
this
as
well
as
i
do
but
be
it
known
there
are
rights
against
which
time
does
not
prescribe
there
are
rights
which
the
priests
and
people
have
never
renounced
and
which
the
church
of
christ
will
always
like
to
see
them
enjoy
i
do
not
say
that
the
bishops
are
not
ordained
to
govern
the
christian
people
but
i
say
that
the
bishops
are
not
appointed
by
the
church
to
govern
the
flock
according
to
their
caprices
but
according
to
the
unchangeable
rules
of
justice
equity
and
truth
of
the
gospel
in
the
primitive
church
every
time
that
a
bishop
forgot
this
other
bishops
reminded
him
of
it
do
we
not
see
in
the
gospel
that
the
first
christians
complained
bitterly
to
the
apostles
themselves
of
the
manner
in
which
they
had
administered
the
goods
entrusted
to
them
were
they
excommunicated
for
that
did
they
receive
in
answer
the
insolent
reply
that
the
people
receive
viz
you
are
but
the
laity
that
does
not
concern
you
no
the
apostles
listened
to
the
complaints
of
the
people
they
found
them
just
and
the
people
were
allowed
to
choose
the
administrators
of
their
goods
the
people
then
were
looked
upon
as
something
worthy
of
attention
and
respect
and
were
not
tied
as
to
the
feet
of
a
dignitary
and
obliged
to
go
right
and
left
at
the
good
pleasure
of
their
pretended
master
the
people
were
not
then
bridled
were
not
mere
machines
to
pay
tithes
build
palaces
raise
proud
cathedrals
nor
were
they
degraded
demoralized
as
obliged
to
believe
they
had
minds
but
had
no
right
to
make
use
of
them
they
were
not
then
as
now
poor
beasts
of
burthen
whose
only
duty
is
to
obey
their
master
but
their
wants
and
wishes
were
consulted
their
voice
was
heard
they
had
not
yet
the
idea
that
the
holy
ghost
was
to
enlighten
only
a
certain
class
of
men
and
that
the
rest
of
humanity
were
given
up
to
ignorance
only
to
walk
in
the
light
of
a
few
privileged
luminaries
but
the
spirit
of
wisdom
charity
and
tolerance
this
respect
for
the
will
and
wishes
of
the
people
where
do
you
find
them
on
the
contrary
we
find
tyranny
on
the
one
side
and
stern
and
necessary
resistance
on
the
other
resistances
which
are
but
the
expression
of
the
law
of
god
let
the
tolerant
conduct
of
the
apostles
who
listened
with
so
much
humility
to
the
complaints
of
the
first
christians
be
compared
to
that
of
bishop
o
regan
when
questioned
by
the
french
people
of
chicago
upon
the
right
he
had
to
deprive
them
of
their
church
to
give
it
to
another
congregation
put
them
out
of
doors
saying
you
do
not
know
your
religion
i
have
the
right
to
sell
your
churches
and
the
grounds
attached
to
them
put
the
money
in
my
pocket
and
eat
and
drink
where
i
this
is
what
bishop
o
regan
has
said
and
done
and
this
is
what
the
bishop
of
canada
approves
and
sanctions
in
the
name
of
the
gospel
they
try
to
make
you
believe
that
it
is
the
doctrine
of
jesus
christ
which
these
high
dignitaries
preach
and
practice
let
the
poor
people
of
canada
believe
this
if
they
wish
as
for
us
in
anne
we
do
not
and
never
will
believe
it
are
not
these
men
who
cry
the
loudest
to
make
us
respect
the
canons
of
the
church
the
very
men
who
publicly
trample
the
most
holy
laws
of
the
people
and
of
the
church
under
their
feet
how
easy
it
would
be
to
put
to
those
powerful
personages
questions
which
they
would
call
impertinent
but
which
would
shed
great
light
in
the
midst
of
the
profound
darkness
in
which
a
certain
corner
of
the
world
is
kept
you
who
overwhelm
us
with
curses
and
send
us
to
hell
if
we
are
not
ready
to
say
amen
to
all
you
say
what
have
you
done
with
the
canon
of
the
holy
council
of
nice
which
forbids
you
to
change
a
priest
s
charge
without
his
permission
where
is
the
canon
of
a
general
council
which
allows
the
bishops
to
add
the
words
ad
in
the
powers
given
to
the
priests
while
one
of
the
canons
of
the
church
says
it
is
the
authority
of
the
canons
and
the
examination
of
the
conduct
of
the
priests
which
ought
to
give
or
take
away
the
ecclesiastical
dignities
and
not
the
of
the
history
has
preserved
the
names
of
certain
tyrants
who
forced
the
trembling
hand
of
a
father
to
set
fire
to
the
pile
which
consumed
his
own
child
ah
why
do
these
bishops
of
canada
remind
us
of
that
lamentable
page
of
past
centuries
in
commanding
you
to
throw
burning
coals
on
the
pile
to
which
they
have
led
me
you
are
more
than
a
friend
to
me
i
have
the
right
to
call
you
when
still
very
young
domestic
misfortunes
forced
me
to
leave
for
a
strange
country
in
search
of
a
living
you
stretched
out
to
me
a
helping
hand
although
poor
yourself
you
shared
your
bread
with
the
poor
orphan
you
opened
to
me
the
doors
of
the
college
where
i
studied
and
ever
since
when
a
tempest
threatened
my
fragile
bark
with
shipwreck
in
your
arms
i
found
sure
port
every
time
i
received
a
wound
in
the
struggles
of
life
in
your
affection
i
found
a
remedy
when
heaven
chose
your
poor
friend
to
change
the
face
of
our
dear
country
it
was
beneath
your
hospitable
roof
that
i
found
rest
your
hand
was
the
last
one
which
pressed
mine
when
in
i
left
canada
to
consecrate
myself
to
the
service
of
the
emigrants
and
lastly
when
the
thunders
of
three
deluded
prelates
fell
upon
my
head
i
said
to
myself
i
have
in
canada
a
friend
a
father
i
am
so
sure
of
his
heart
that
i
do
not
even
need
to
call
him
to
aid
there
is
a
voice
in
his
soul
which
cries
to
him
go
go
to
the
aid
of
thy
friend
thy
child
i
was
not
mistaken
on
the
of
november
you
pressed
me
to
your
heart
your
words
of
peace
and
charity
cheered
my
broken
heart
for
the
love
of
god
and
for
your
sake
also
my
dear
brassard
i
have
consented
to
do
all
you
have
required
of
me
ah
why
did
you
not
come
alone
how
easily
everything
would
have
been
settled
but
without
knowing
it
you
had
with
you
a
traitor
who
came
to
give
the
people
and
pastor
of
anne
the
kiss
of
judas
before
delivering
them
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
you
are
commanded
to
add
your
efforts
to
those
of
this
traitor
to
strike
me
they
want
you
to
add
a
new
thorn
to
that
crown
of
shame
which
the
bishops
have
placed
on
my
forehead
but
how
can
i
be
guilty
for
having
called
you
as
a
witness
of
the
iniquities
of
my
enemies
have
you
forgotten
with
what
sincerity
and
promptitude
i
signed
as
well
as
my
brethren
of
anne
the
act
of
submission
to
the
bishop
o
regan
have
you
forgotten
the
desolation
of
your
heart
and
mine
when
on
the
conditions
you
well
know
i
declared
to
my
people
that
i
would
no
longer
be
their
pastor
since
the
bishops
of
canada
command
you
to
speak
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
truth
and
justice
i
also
ask
you
to
speak
yes
state
to
the
people
of
canada
how
shamefully
desaulnier
has
deceived
the
generous
people
who
surround
me
here
yes
tell
your
surprise
your
just
indignation
your
bitter
sorrow
when
desaulnier
refused
in
chicago
to
fulfill
the
sacred
promise
he
had
made
tell
the
nature
of
the
new
document
which
he
wanted
me
to
sign
at
chicago
declare
honestly
that
you
said
to
me
my
poor
friend
you
can
not
sign
that
act
without
lying
and
dishonoring
yourself
since
the
bishops
of
canada
command
you
to
speak
raise
your
voice
to
say
to
the
canadian
people
what
you
wrote
to
letourneaux
and
to
myself
they
do
not
wish
to
know
the
truth
in
canada
more
than
at
chicago
about
the
shameful
conduct
of
desaulnier
in
this
affair
yes
speak
give
to
my
dear
canada
the
reply
which
the
bishop
of
chicago
made
when
you
asked
have
you
any
accusation
in
hand
against
the
character
of
chiniquy
i
need
your
testimony
upon
this
question
for
the
bishop
of
chicago
forgetting
what
he
confessed
to
you
is
circulating
through
my
enemies
a
thousand
calumnies
against
me
which
are
reproduced
by
the
bishop
of
montreal
say
to
canada
that
the
bishop
of
chicago
assured
you
that
he
had
interdicted
me
because
i
disobeyed
him
in
refusing
to
leave
anne
whilst
at
the
very
time
he
held
a
letter
brought
by
four
witnesses
saying
that
i
was
ready
to
obey
and
that
i
would
prefer
going
to
the
end
of
the
world
rather
than
be
interdicted
if
having
said
all
these
things
you
are
still
commanded
to
strike
me
do
so
dear
friend
though
your
blows
go
more
directly
to
my
heart
than
all
the
thunders
of
bishop
o
regan
they
will
never
shake
my
constancy
nor
make
me
betray
my
brethren
they
will
neither
make
me
change
my
convictions
nor
force
me
any
longer
to
bend
the
knee
before
men
who
wish
us
to
submit
to
their
capricious
and
impious
commands
rather
than
to
the
laws
of
the
god
of
justice
truth
and
mercy
whose
priest
i
have
the
honor
to
be
i
have
sworn
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
to
preach
truth
and
justice
nothing
will
make
me
break
my
oath
do
you
remember
with
what
dignity
you
refused
one
day
to
bow
before
one
of
those
modern
divinities
who
believe
that
everything
is
allowed
them
on
earth
do
you
not
recollect
that
the
bishop
of
ottawa
had
the
audacity
to
take
one
of
your
letters
out
of
the
postoffice
and
read
it
hoping
the
shameful
act
would
never
be
known
i
shall
never
forget
the
noble
independence
with
which
you
protested
against
that
abuse
of
power
and
with
what
indignation
you
threatened
to
drag
that
haughty
bishop
before
the
courts
of
justice
if
he
did
not
ask
pardon
for
that
outrage
were
you
revolting
against
the
church
of
christ
then
no
for
you
knew
that
her
principles
of
truth
and
justice
could
not
sanction
such
brigandage
so
i
did
not
revolt
against
the
church
of
christ
when
i
resisted
the
insolence
and
outrages
of
the
bishop
of
chicago
like
jerome
i
know
the
rights
of
the
bishops
i
respect
their
authority
the
catholic
hierarchy
is
to
me
a
holy
and
venerable
institution
but
when
men
sheltering
themselves
behind
those
holy
institutions
trample
under
their
feet
the
principles
of
justice
truth
and
holiness
which
the
gospel
of
christ
inculcates
i
will
fight
to
the
end
with
my
poor
emigrants
for
the
preservation
of
their
christian
rights
you
say
that
before
all
we
must
be
frankly
and
sincerely
i
answer
yes
but
when
one
is
wrongfully
deprived
of
this
glorious
name
before
men
because
he
opposes
as
i
have
done
the
brigandage
of
a
bishop
who
believes
all
is
allowed
him
he
can
remain
in
peace
and
be
like
paul
who
did
not
care
what
men
said
or
thought
of
him
to
be
anathematized
because
i
have
devoted
myself
to
the
welfare
of
my
brethren
is
not
such
a
sad
destiny
as
some
people
think
paul
said
i
could
wish
that
myself
were
accursed
from
christ
for
my
brethren
my
kinsmen
according
to
the
the
favor
after
which
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
sighed
has
been
accorded
me
i
can
not
complain
of
it
besides
does
not
christ
himself
say
to
those
who
labor
to
scatter
seeds
of
justice
and
truth
upon
the
earth
that
they
ought
not
expect
to
be
treated
better
than
he
from
every
part
of
canada
and
the
united
states
men
of
distinction
cease
not
to
cry
courage
it
is
true
that
several
curse
us
but
it
is
because
they
are
forced
to
do
it
many
keep
silent
for
fear
of
their
masters
but
their
prayers
and
sympathies
are
for
us
the
bishops
will
see
sooner
or
later
that
in
order
to
retain
their
power
on
earth
that
power
must
be
founded
as
in
heaven
upon
justice
and
truth
when
the
priests
of
canada
to
please
the
bishops
contrary
to
their
convictions
have
degraded
their
own
sacerdotal
character
in
my
person
when
they
have
burned
the
effigy
of
the
proscribed
having
no
more
the
glorious
privilege
of
burning
his
body
when
the
father
whom
by
the
grace
of
god
i
have
snatched
from
an
abyss
cursed
me
when
this
dear
young
man
who
has
so
many
times
blessed
me
because
i
have
shown
him
the
gospel
the
way
of
honor
and
virtue
by
removing
the
stumbling
block
of
intemperance
offered
to
his
weakness
has
been
forced
to
curse
me
when
that
poor
woman
who
by
the
grace
of
god
owes
me
the
bread
she
eats
and
the
few
days
of
holy
felicity
she
has
enjoyed
upon
earth
has
cursed
me
when
this
fine
little
child
who
has
so
many
times
blessed
my
name
because
god
made
use
of
me
to
give
him
back
a
father
has
cursed
me
there
will
be
a
silence
of
sorrow
in
canada
around
my
proscribed
name
then
a
reaction
will
take
place
a
great
prestige
will
be
destroyed
a
great
power
holy
and
benevolent
in
its
origin
but
fallen
by
its
excesses
will
be
destroyed
god
grant
that
in
the
midst
of
those
ruins
there
may
be
no
tears
no
blood
this
is
not
prophecy
it
is
history
yes
let
the
canadian
clergy
open
the
records
of
the
past
and
they
will
find
where
their
blind
and
demoralizing
obedience
to
the
bishops
leads
them
and
their
good
and
generous
people
if
not
to
infidelity
and
atheism
you
advise
me
dear
brassard
to
put
myself
in
the
canonical
ways
but
have
i
not
already
done
so
have
not
the
bishops
of
canada
told
you
that
the
letter
signed
by
me
has
already
placed
me
in
that
position
has
not
desaulnier
said
in
your
presence
to
my
people
and
myself
at
anne
sign
this
act
and
if
the
bishop
does
not
take
away
his
sentence
of
excommunication
i
will
say
to
him
it
is
not
chiniquy
neither
his
people
who
wish
a
schism
they
have
done
what
religion
and
honor
commanded
them
it
is
the
bishop
of
chicago
who
makes
the
what
have
we
gained
by
taking
that
public
step
nothing
but
to
be
cruelly
and
shamefully
betrayed
was
not
jesus
christ
betrayed
only
once
by
judas
do
not
then
expect
that
we
will
be
stronger
than
the
son
of
god
the
bishops
of
canada
by
their
emissary
have
already
betrayed
us
of
which
you
have
been
witness
the
people
and
missionary
of
anne
do
not
feel
strong
enough
to
present
their
cheek
again
to
the
smiter
in
spite
of
the
clamors
which
rise
around
us
we
are
convinced
that
we
may
be
good
catholics
without
submitting
to
that
degradation
twice
the
bishops
of
canada
want
you
to
speak
very
well
my
dear
brassard
i
also
implore
you
to
speak
in
the
name
of
the
friendship
which
has
united
us
for
forty
years
i
implore
you
to
tell
the
truth
did
you
not
after
reading
the
document
which
the
bishop
of
chicago
commanded
me
to
sign
as
the
only
condition
of
peace
say
to
me
my
dear
friend
you
can
not
sign
such
a
writing
without
lying
and
dishonoring
yourself
forever
and
behold
you
cry
to
my
brethren
to
destroy
and
abandon
me
when
you
know
that
the
position
in
which
i
stand
is
but
the
result
of
my
refusal
to
sign
a
most
infamous
lying
and
degrading
document
these
things
and
many
others
which
you
know
would
serve
wonderfully
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
people
upon
the
awful
abuse
of
power
of
which
certain
bishops
are
every
day
guilty
this
would
aid
to
unmask
certain
modern
divinities
who
pretend
that
we
can
not
go
to
heaven
without
their
permission
who
preach
that
it
is
not
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
but
a
certain
passport
of
which
they
hold
the
patent
which
assures
us
a
place
among
the
elect
of
god
a
sentence
founded
upon
a
public
lie
and
which
was
resisted
can
not
constitute
a
schism
christian
men
who
like
the
catholics
of
chicago
kankakee
and
anne
resist
iniquity
may
be
condemned
by
men
but
not
by
god
i
was
not
suspended
on
the
of
august
and
so
i
could
exercise
the
holy
functions
of
my
ministry
the
following
morning
and
after
it
is
the
church
which
assures
us
of
this
through
her
greatest
theologians
as
it
is
not
enough
to
say
my
god
my
god
to
be
saved
so
it
is
not
enough
to
cry
you
are
lost
you
are
lost
for
one
to
be
lost
the
son
of
god
who
gave
his
life
to
save
man
gave
us
a
thousand
proofs
that
the
salvation
of
our
soul
has
a
foundation
more
certain
than
the
capricious
will
of
a
sinful
being
he
has
given
to
no
one
the
power
to
save
or
condemn
according
to
his
pleasure
if
some
bishops
and
priests
believe
this
it
is
not
the
faith
of
the
people
of
chicago
kankakee
and
anne
i
will
tell
you
again
my
dear
brassard
that
if
in
order
to
obey
the
bishop
of
montreal
you
should
strip
me
of
the
little
honor
which
surrounds
my
name
in
canada
i
shall
still
never
forget
the
good
you
have
done
me
yes
command
my
friends
to
betray
me
to
trample
me
under
their
feet
to
turn
away
from
me
in
horror
never
will
you
be
able
to
weaken
my
sentiments
of
respect
and
gratitude
for
you
i
will
still
love
and
bless
you
for
i
know
the
hand
which
forced
yours
to
do
so
i
will
always
know
that
your
own
heart
was
first
struck
and
wounded
by
the
blow
they
commanded
you
to
give
to
your
friend
and
son
in
jesus
christ
c
the
effect
of
that
letter
upon
brassard
was
still
more
powerful
than
i
had
expected
it
forced
him
to
blush
at
his
own
cowardice
and
to
ask
me
pardon
for
the
unjust
sentence
he
had
passed
upon
me
to
obey
the
bishop
here
are
the
parts
of
the
letter
bearing
upon
that
subject
roch
mai
moncher
chiniquy
je
suis
plus
convainen
que
jamais
que
tu
n
as
jamais
ete
interdit
legalement
depuis
que
j
ai
appris
par
monseigneur
de
montreal
que
l
eveque
de
chicago
t
a
interdit
de
vive
voix
dans
sa
chambre
ce
que
ligoury
dit
etre
nul
te
de
nul
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
that
you
have
never
been
legally
interdicted
since
bishop
bourget
told
me
that
bishop
o
regan
had
interdicted
you
privately
in
his
private
room
ligoury
says
that
it
is
a
nullity
and
that
it
can
have
no
effect
i
beg
your
pardon
for
what
i
wrote
against
you
i
have
been
forced
to
do
it
because
i
had
not
yet
sufficiently
condemned
you
and
that
my
name
which
you
were
citing
in
your
writings
was
giving
you
too
much
power
and
a
too
clear
condemnation
of
bishop
o
regan
the
bishop
of
montreal
abusing
his
authority
over
me
forced
me
to
sign
that
document
against
you
i
would
not
do
it
if
it
were
to
be
done
again
keep
silence
on
what
i
tell
you
in
this
letter
it
is
all
confidential
you
understand
it
your
devoted
friend
brassard
no
priest
in
canada
had
more
deservedly
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
a
man
of
honor
than
brassard
not
one
had
ever
stood
so
high
in
my
esteem
and
respect
his
sudden
and
unexpected
fall
filled
my
heart
with
an
unspeakable
sadness
i
may
say
that
it
snapped
the
last
thread
which
held
me
to
the
church
of
rome
till
then
it
was
not
only
my
hope
but
my
firm
conviction
that
there
were
many
honest
upright
priests
in
that
church
and
brassard
was
to
me
the
very
personification
of
honesty
how
can
i
describe
the
shock
i
felt
when
i
saw
him
there
in
the
mud
a
monument
of
the
unspeakable
corruption
of
my
church
the
perfidious
delilah
had
seduced
and
destroyed
this
modern
sampson
enchained
as
a
trembling
slave
at
the
feet
of
the
new
implacable
moloch
the
authority
of
the
bishop
he
had
not
only
lost
the
fear
of
god
and
the
respect
he
owed
to
himself
by
publicly
declaring
that
i
was
guilty
when
he
knew
that
i
was
innocent
but
he
had
so
completely
lost
every
sentiment
of
honesty
that
he
wanted
me
to
keep
secret
his
declaration
of
my
innocence
at
the
very
moment
he
was
inviting
my
whole
country
through
the
press
to
abhor
and
condemn
me
as
a
criminal
i
read
again
and
again
the
strange
letter
every
word
of
it
was
destroying
the
last
illusions
which
had
concealed
from
my
mind
the
absolute
and
incurable
perversity
of
the
church
of
rome
i
had
no
hard
feelings
against
this
last
friend
whom
she
had
poisoned
with
the
wine
of
her
prostitutions
i
felt
only
a
profound
compassion
for
him
i
pitied
and
forgave
him
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
every
word
of
his
letter
sounded
in
my
ears
as
the
warning
voice
of
the
angel
sent
to
save
lot
from
the
doomed
city
of
sodom
escape
for
thy
life
look
not
behind
thee
neither
stay
thou
in
all
the
plain
escape
thou
to
the
mountain
lest
thou
be
consumed
chapter
lxiv
i
write
to
pope
pius
ix
and
to
napoleon
emperor
of
france
and
send
them
the
public
documents
proving
the
bad
conduct
of
bishop
o
bidini
ordered
to
bishop
called
to
rome
is
forced
to
resign
and
becomes
a
smith
of
dubuque
named
administrator
of
the
diocese
of
vicar
dunn
sent
to
tell
me
of
my
victory
at
go
to
dubuque
to
offer
my
submission
to
the
bishop
i
had
not
forgotten
the
advice
given
me
by
archbishop
kenrick
of
louis
april
to
address
my
complaints
to
the
pope
himself
but
the
terrible
difficulties
and
trials
which
had
constantly
followed
each
other
had
made
it
impossible
to
follow
that
advice
the
betrayal
of
mons
desaulnier
and
the
defection
of
mons
brassard
however
had
so
strangely
complicated
my
position
that
i
felt
the
only
way
to
escape
the
wreck
which
threatened
myself
and
my
colony
and
to
save
the
holy
cause
god
had
entrusted
me
was
to
strike
such
a
blow
to
our
haughty
persecutor
that
he
could
not
survive
it
i
determined
to
send
to
the
pope
all
the
public
accusations
which
had
been
legally
proved
and
published
against
the
bishop
with
the
copy
of
the
numerous
and
infamous
suits
which
he
had
sustained
before
the
civil
courts
and
had
almost
invariably
lost
with
the
sentences
of
the
judges
who
had
condemned
him
this
took
me
nearly
two
months
of
the
hardest
labors
of
my
life
i
had
gathered
all
those
documents
which
covered
more
than
pages
of
foolscap
i
mailed
them
to
pope
pius
accompanied
by
only
the
following
words
holy
father
for
the
sake
of
your
precious
lambs
which
are
slaughtered
and
devoured
in
this
vast
diocese
by
a
ravening
wolf
bishop
o
regan
and
in
the
name
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
i
implore
your
holiness
to
see
if
what
is
contained
in
these
documents
is
correct
or
not
if
everything
is
found
correct
for
the
sake
of
the
blood
shed
on
calvary
to
save
our
immortal
souls
please
take
away
from
our
midst
the
unworthy
bishop
whose
daily
scandals
can
no
longer
be
tolerated
by
a
christian
in
order
to
prevent
the
pope
s
servants
from
throwing
my
letter
with
those
documents
into
their
waste
paper
baskets
i
sent
a
copy
of
them
all
to
napoleon
emperor
of
france
respectfully
requesting
him
to
see
through
his
ambassador
at
washington
and
his
consul
at
chicago
whether
these
papers
contained
the
truth
or
not
i
told
him
how
his
countrymen
were
trampled
under
the
feet
of
bishop
o
regan
and
how
they
were
ruined
and
spoiled
to
the
benefit
of
the
irish
people
how
the
churches
built
by
the
money
of
the
french
were
openly
stolen
and
transferred
to
the
emigrants
from
ireland
napoleon
had
just
sent
an
army
to
punish
the
emperor
of
china
on
account
of
some
injustice
done
to
a
frenchman
i
told
him
the
injustice
done
to
that
frenchman
in
the
chinese
empire
is
nothing
to
what
is
done
here
every
day
not
against
one
but
hundreds
of
your
majesty
s
countrymen
a
word
from
the
emperor
of
france
to
his
holiness
will
do
here
what
your
armies
have
done
in
china
force
the
unjust
and
merciless
oppressor
of
the
french
of
illinois
to
do
them
i
ended
my
letter
by
saying
my
grandfather
though
born
in
spain
married
a
french
lady
and
became
by
choice
and
adoption
a
french
citizen
he
became
a
captain
in
the
french
navy
and
for
gallant
service
was
awarded
lands
in
canada
which
by
the
fate
of
war
fell
into
the
hands
of
great
britain
upon
retiring
from
the
service
of
france
he
settled
upon
his
estates
in
canada
where
my
father
and
myself
were
born
i
am
thus
with
other
canadians
who
have
come
to
this
country
a
british
subject
by
birth
an
american
citizen
by
adoption
but
french
still
in
blood
and
roman
catholic
in
religion
i
therefore
on
the
part
of
a
noble
french
people
humbly
ask
your
majesty
to
aid
us
by
interceding
with
his
holiness
pope
pius
to
have
these
outrages
and
wrongs
the
success
of
this
bold
step
was
more
prompt
and
complete
than
i
had
expected
the
emperor
was
then
all
powerful
at
rome
he
had
not
only
brought
the
pope
from
civita
vecchia
to
rome
after
taking
that
city
from
the
hands
of
the
italian
republicans
a
few
years
before
but
he
was
still
the
very
guardian
and
protector
of
the
pope
a
few
months
later
when
in
chicago
the
grand
vicar
dunn
showed
me
a
letter
from
bishop
o
regan
who
had
been
ordered
to
go
to
rome
and
give
an
account
of
his
administration
in
which
he
had
said
one
of
the
strangest
things
which
has
occurred
to
me
in
rome
is
that
the
influence
of
the
emperor
napoleon
is
against
me
here
i
can
not
understand
what
right
he
he
has
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
my
i
had
learned
since
that
it
was
really
through
the
advice
of
napoleon
that
cardinal
bidini
who
had
been
previously
sent
to
the
united
states
to
inquire
about
the
scandal
given
by
bishop
o
regan
gave
his
opinion
in
our
favor
the
cardinal
having
consulted
the
bishops
of
the
united
states
who
unanimously
denounced
o
regan
as
unfit
and
unworthy
of
such
a
high
position
immediately
ordered
him
to
go
to
rome
where
the
pope
unceremoniously
transferred
him
from
the
bishopric
of
chicago
to
a
diocese
extinct
more
than
years
ago
called
this
was
as
good
as
a
bishopric
in
the
moon
he
consoled
himself
in
his
misfortune
by
drawing
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
stolen
money
he
had
sent
at
different
times
to
be
deposited
in
the
banks
of
paris
and
went
to
ireland
where
he
established
a
bank
and
died
in
on
the
of
march
at
about
o
clock
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
and
surprised
to
hear
the
voice
of
my
devoted
friend
rev
dunn
grand
vicar
of
chicago
asking
my
hospitality
for
the
night
his
first
words
were
my
visit
here
must
be
absolutely
incognito
in
ordering
me
to
come
and
see
you
the
bishop
of
dubuque
who
is
just
named
administrator
of
chicago
advised
me
to
come
as
secretly
as
possible
he
said
triumph
at
rome
is
perfect
you
have
gained
the
greatest
victory
a
priest
ever
won
over
his
unjust
bishop
but
you
must
thank
the
emperor
napoleon
for
it
it
is
to
his
advice
which
under
the
present
circumstances
is
equal
to
an
order
that
you
owe
the
protection
of
the
cardinal
bidini
his
report
to
the
pope
is
that
all
the
documents
you
sent
to
rome
were
correct
the
inquiry
of
the
cardinal
has
brought
facts
to
the
knowledge
of
the
pope
still
more
compromising
than
what
you
have
written
against
him
several
bishops
of
the
united
states
have
unanimously
denounced
bishop
o
regan
as
a
most
depraved
man
entirely
unworthy
of
his
position
and
have
advised
the
pope
to
take
him
away
and
choose
another
bishop
for
chicago
it
is
acknowledged
at
rome
that
all
the
sentences
pronounced
by
that
bishop
against
you
are
unjust
and
null
our
good
administrator
has
been
advised
to
put
an
end
at
once
to
all
the
troubles
of
your
colony
by
treating
you
as
a
good
and
faithful
i
come
here
not
only
to
congratulate
you
on
your
victory
but
also
to
thank
you
in
my
name
and
in
the
name
of
the
church
for
having
saved
our
diocese
from
such
a
plague
for
bishop
o
regan
is
a
real
plague
a
few
more
years
of
such
administration
would
have
destroyed
our
holy
religion
in
illinois
however
as
you
handled
the
poor
bishop
pretty
roughly
it
is
suspected
at
a
distance
that
you
and
your
people
are
more
protestants
than
catholics
we
know
better
here
for
from
the
beginning
it
was
evident
that
the
act
of
excommunication
posted
at
the
door
of
your
chapel
by
three
priests
too
drunk
to
know
what
they
were
about
is
a
nullity
having
never
been
signed
by
the
bishop
it
was
a
shameful
and
sacrilegious
comedy
but
in
many
distant
places
that
excommunication
was
accepted
as
valid
and
you
are
considered
by
many
as
a
real
schismatic
bishop
smith
has
thought
it
advisable
to
ask
you
to
give
him
a
written
and
canonical
act
of
submission
which
he
will
publish
to
show
the
world
that
you
are
still
a
good
roman
catholic
i
thanked
the
grand
vicar
for
his
kind
words
and
the
good
news
he
was
giving
me
and
i
asked
him
to
help
me
to
thank
god
for
having
so
visibly
protected
and
guided
me
through
all
these
terrible
difficulties
we
both
knelt
and
repeated
the
sublime
words
of
gratitude
and
joy
of
the
old
prophet
bless
the
lord
oh
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
bless
his
holy
name
etc
ps
ciii
i
then
said
that
i
had
no
objection
to
give
the
renewed
act
of
my
faith
and
submission
to
the
church
that
it
might
be
published
i
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
with
emotions
of
joy
and
gratitude
to
god
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
express
i
slowly
prepared
to
write
but
as
i
was
considering
what
form
i
should
give
to
that
document
a
sudden
strange
thought
struck
my
mind
is
this
not
the
golden
opportunity
to
put
an
end
to
the
terrible
temptations
which
have
shaken
my
faith
and
distressed
me
for
so
many
years
i
said
to
myself
is
not
this
a
providential
opportunity
to
silence
those
mysterious
voices
which
are
troubling
me
almost
every
hour
that
in
the
church
of
rome
we
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
the
lying
traditions
of
men
i
determined
then
to
frame
my
act
of
submission
in
such
a
way
that
i
would
silence
those
voices
and
be
more
than
ever
sure
that
my
faith
the
faith
of
my
dear
church
which
had
just
given
me
such
a
glorious
victory
at
rome
was
based
upon
the
holy
word
of
god
on
the
divine
doctrines
of
the
gospel
i
then
wrote
down
in
my
own
name
and
in
the
name
of
my
people
my
lord
bishop
smith
bishop
of
dubuque
and
administrator
of
the
diocese
of
chicago
want
to
live
and
die
in
the
holy
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
church
out
of
which
there
is
no
salvation
and
to
prove
this
to
your
lordship
we
promise
to
obey
the
authority
of
the
church
according
to
the
word
and
commandments
of
god
as
we
find
them
expressed
in
the
gospel
of
christ
c
i
handed
this
writing
to
dunn
and
said
what
do
you
think
of
this
act
of
submission
he
quickly
read
it
and
answered
it
is
just
what
we
want
from
all
right
i
rejoined
but
i
fear
the
bishop
will
not
accept
it
do
you
not
see
that
i
have
put
a
condition
to
our
submission
i
say
that
we
will
submit
ourselves
to
the
bishop
s
authority
but
only
according
to
the
word
of
god
and
the
gospel
of
is
not
that
good
quickly
replied
dunn
yes
my
dear
dunn
this
is
good
very
good
indeed
i
answered
but
my
fear
is
that
it
is
too
good
for
the
bishop
and
the
pope
what
do
you
mean
he
replied
i
mean
that
though
this
act
of
submission
is
very
good
i
fear
lest
the
pope
and
the
bishop
reject
please
explain
yourself
more
clearly
answered
the
grand
vicar
i
do
not
understand
the
reason
for
such
a
my
dear
dunn
i
continued
i
must
confess
to
you
here
a
thing
which
is
known
only
to
god
i
must
show
you
a
bleeding
wound
which
is
in
my
soul
for
many
years
a
wound
which
has
never
been
healed
by
any
of
the
remedies
i
have
applied
to
it
it
is
a
wound
which
i
never
dared
to
show
to
any
man
except
to
my
confessor
though
it
has
often
made
me
suffer
almost
the
tortures
of
hell
you
know
well
that
there
is
not
a
living
priest
who
has
studied
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
holy
fathers
with
more
attention
and
earnestness
these
last
few
years
than
i
have
it
was
not
only
to
strengthen
my
own
faith
but
also
the
faith
of
our
people
and
to
be
able
to
fight
the
battles
of
our
church
against
her
enemies
that
i
spent
so
many
hours
of
my
days
and
nights
in
those
studies
but
though
i
am
confounded
and
ashamed
to
confess
it
to
you
i
must
do
it
the
more
i
have
studied
and
compared
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
holy
fathers
with
the
teachings
of
our
church
the
more
my
faith
has
been
shaken
and
the
more
i
have
been
tempted
to
think
in
spite
of
myself
that
our
church
has
long
ago
given
up
the
word
of
god
and
the
holy
fathers
in
order
to
walk
in
the
muddy
and
crooked
ways
of
human
and
false
traditions
yes
the
more
i
study
the
more
i
am
troubled
by
the
strange
and
mysterious
voices
which
haunt
me
day
and
night
saying
do
you
not
see
that
in
your
church
of
rome
you
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
the
lying
traditions
of
men
what
is
more
strange
and
painful
is
that
the
more
i
pray
to
god
to
silence
these
voices
the
louder
they
repeat
the
same
distressing
things
it
is
to
put
an
end
to
those
awful
temptations
that
i
have
written
this
conditional
submission
i
want
to
prove
to
myself
that
i
will
obey
the
word
of
god
and
the
gospel
of
christ
in
our
church
and
i
shall
be
happy
all
the
rest
of
my
life
if
the
bishops
accept
this
submission
but
i
fear
it
will
be
dunn
promptly
replied
you
are
mistaken
my
dear
chiniquy
i
am
sure
that
our
bishop
will
accept
this
document
as
canonical
and
sufficient
to
show
your
orthodoxy
to
the
if
it
be
so
i
replied
i
will
be
a
most
happy
it
was
agreed
that
on
the
of
march
i
would
go
with
him
to
dubuque
to
present
my
act
of
submission
to
the
administrator
of
the
diocese
after
the
people
had
signed
it
accordingly
at
on
that
day
we
both
took
the
train
at
chicago
for
dubuque
where
we
arrived
next
morning
at
i
went
to
the
palace
of
the
bishop
who
received
me
with
marks
of
the
utmost
cordiality
and
affection
i
presented
him
our
written
act
of
submission
with
a
trembling
hand
fearing
he
would
reject
it
he
read
it
twice
and
throwing
his
arms
around
me
he
pressed
me
to
his
heart
i
felt
his
tears
of
joy
mixed
with
mine
rolling
down
my
cheeks
as
he
said
how
happy
i
am
to
see
that
submission
how
happy
the
pope
and
all
the
bishops
of
the
united
states
will
be
to
hear
of
it
for
i
will
not
conceal
it
from
you
we
feared
that
both
you
and
your
people
would
separate
from
the
church
by
refusing
to
submit
to
her
i
answered
that
i
was
not
less
happy
to
see
an
end
to
those
painful
difficulties
and
i
promised
him
that
with
the
help
of
god
our
holy
church
would
not
have
a
more
faithful
priest
than
myself
while
engaged
in
that
pleasant
conversation
the
dinner
hour
came
he
gave
me
the
place
of
honor
on
his
right
before
the
two
grand
vicars
and
nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
than
the
time
we
spent
around
the
table
which
was
served
with
a
good
and
well
prepared
though
frugal
meal
i
was
happy
to
see
that
the
bishop
with
his
priests
were
teetotalers
no
wine
nor
beer
to
tempt
the
weak
before
the
dinner
was
over
the
bishop
said
to
dunn
you
will
accompany
chiniquy
to
anne
in
order
to
announce
in
my
name
to
the
people
the
restoration
of
peace
next
sabbath
no
doubt
it
will
be
joyful
news
to
the
colony
of
father
chiniquy
after
so
many
years
of
hard
fighting
the
pastor
and
the
people
of
anne
will
enjoy
the
days
of
peace
and
rest
which
are
now
secured
to
then
addressing
himself
to
me
the
bishop
said
the
only
condition
of
that
peace
is
that
you
will
spend
fifteen
days
in
retreat
and
meditation
in
one
of
the
religious
houses
you
will
choose
yourself
i
think
that
after
so
much
noise
and
exciting
controversies
it
will
do
you
good
to
pass
those
days
in
meditation
and
prayer
in
some
of
our
beautiful
and
peaceful
solitudes
i
answered
him
if
your
lordship
had
not
offered
me
the
favor
of
those
days
of
perfect
and
christian
rest
i
would
have
asked
you
to
grant
it
i
consider
it
as
a
crowning
of
all
your
acts
of
kindness
to
offer
me
those
few
days
of
calm
and
meditation
after
the
terrible
storms
of
those
last
three
years
if
your
lordship
has
no
objection
to
my
choice
i
will
go
to
the
beautiful
solitude
where
saurin
has
built
the
celebrated
monastery
college
and
university
of
joseph
indiana
i
hope
that
nothing
will
prevent
my
being
there
next
monday
after
going
next
sabbath
in
the
company
of
grand
vicar
dunn
to
proclaim
the
restoration
of
the
blessed
peace
to
my
people
of
you
can
not
make
a
better
choice
answered
the
bishop
but
my
lord
i
rejoined
i
hope
your
lordship
will
have
no
objection
to
give
me
a
written
assurance
of
the
perfect
restoration
of
that
peace
there
are
people
who
i
know
will
not
believe
me
when
i
tell
them
how
quickly
and
nobly
your
lordship
has
put
an
end
to
all
those
deplorable
difficulties
i
want
to
show
them
that
i
stand
in
the
same
relation
with
my
superiors
and
the
church
in
which
i
stood
previous
to
these
unfortunate
certainly
said
the
bishop
you
are
in
need
of
such
a
document
from
your
bishop
and
you
shall
have
it
i
will
write
it
at
but
he
had
not
yet
written
two
lines
when
dunn
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
we
have
not
a
minute
to
lose
if
we
want
to
be
in
time
for
the
chicago
i
then
said
to
the
bishop
please
my
lord
address
me
that
important
document
to
chicago
where
i
will
get
it
at
the
postoffice
on
my
way
to
the
university
of
joseph
next
monday
your
lordship
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
write
it
this
the
bishop
having
consented
i
hastily
took
leave
of
him
with
dunn
after
having
received
his
benediction
on
our
way
back
to
anne
the
next
day
we
stopped
at
bourbonnaise
to
see
the
grand
vicar
mailloux
one
of
the
priests
who
had
been
sent
by
the
bishops
of
canada
to
help
my
lord
o
regan
to
crush
me
we
found
him
as
he
was
going
to
his
dining
room
to
take
his
dinner
he
was
visibly
humiliated
by
the
complete
defeat
of
bishop
o
regan
at
rome
after
mr
dunn
told
him
that
he
was
sent
to
proclaim
peace
to
the
people
of
anne
he
coldly
asked
the
written
proof
of
such
strange
news
dunn
answered
him
do
you
think
sir
that
i
would
be
mean
enough
to
tell
you
a
lie
i
do
not
say
that
you
are
telling
me
a
lie
replied
mailloux
i
believe
what
you
say
but
i
want
to
know
the
condition
of
that
unexpected
peace
has
chiniquy
made
his
submission
to
the
church
yes
sir
i
replied
here
is
a
copy
of
my
act
of
he
read
it
and
coldly
said
this
is
not
an
act
of
submission
to
the
church
but
only
to
the
authority
of
the
gospel
which
is
a
very
different
thing
this
document
can
be
presented
by
a
protestant
but
it
can
not
be
offered
by
a
catholic
priest
to
his
bishop
i
can
not
understand
how
our
bishop
did
not
see
that
at
dunn
answered
him
my
dear
grand
vicar
mailloux
i
have
often
been
told
that
it
does
not
do
to
be
more
loyal
than
the
king
my
hope
was
that
you
would
rejoice
with
us
at
the
news
of
the
peace
i
am
sorry
to
see
that
i
was
mistaken
however
i
must
tell
you
that
if
you
want
to
fight
you
will
have
nobody
to
fight
against
for
father
chiniquy
was
yesterday
accepted
as
a
regular
priest
of
our
holy
church
by
the
administrator
this
ought
to
satisfy
i
listened
to
the
unpleasant
conversation
of
those
two
grand
vicars
with
painful
feelings
without
saying
a
word
for
i
was
troubled
by
those
mysterious
voices
which
were
reiterating
in
my
mind
the
cry
do
you
not
see
that
in
the
church
of
rome
you
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
only
the
lying
traditions
of
men
i
felt
much
relieved
when
i
left
the
house
of
that
so
badly
disposed
confrere
to
come
to
anne
where
the
people
had
gathered
on
the
public
square
to
receive
us
and
rend
the
air
with
their
cries
of
joy
at
the
happy
news
of
peace
the
next
day
of
march
was
palm
sunday
one
of
the
grand
festivities
of
the
church
of
rome
there
was
an
immense
concourse
of
people
attracted
not
only
by
the
religious
solemnity
of
the
feast
but
also
by
the
desire
to
see
and
hear
the
deputy
sent
by
their
bishop
to
proclaim
peace
he
did
it
in
a
most
elegant
english
address
which
i
translated
into
french
he
presented
me
a
blessed
palm
and
i
offered
him
another
loaded
with
beautiful
flowers
in
the
presence
of
the
people
as
a
public
sign
of
the
concord
which
was
restored
between
my
colony
and
the
authorities
of
the
church
that
my
christian
readers
may
understand
my
blindness
and
the
mercies
of
god
towards
me
i
must
confess
here
to
my
shame
that
i
was
glad
to
have
made
my
peace
with
those
sinful
men
which
was
not
peace
with
my
god
but
that
great
god
had
looked
down
upon
me
in
mercy
he
was
soon
to
break
that
peace
with
the
great
apostate
church
which
is
poisoning
the
world
with
the
wine
of
her
enchantments
that
i
might
walk
in
the
light
of
the
gospel
and
possess
that
peace
and
joy
which
passeth
all
understanding

bishop
smith
had
fulfilled
his
promise
in
addressing
to
me
a
testimonial
letter
which
would
show
to
both
friends
and
foes
that
the
most
honorable
and
lasting
peace
between
us
was
to
succeed
the
deplorable
years
of
strife
through
which
we
had
just
passed
i
read
it
with
grand
vicar
dunn
who
was
not
less
pleased
than
i
with
the
kind
expressions
of
esteem
towards
my
people
and
myself
with
which
it
was
filled
i
had
never
had
a
document
in
which
my
private
and
public
character
were
so
kindly
appreciated
i
put
it
in
my
portfolio
as
the
most
precious
treasure
i
had
ever
possessed
and
my
gratitude
to
the
bishop
who
had
written
such
friendly
lines
was
boundless
i
at
once
addressed
a
short
letter
to
thank
and
bless
him
and
i
requested
him
to
pray
for
me
during
the
happy
days
of
retreat
i
was
to
spend
at
the
monastery
of
joseph
the
venerable
grand
vicar
saurin
and
his
assistant
rev
granger
received
me
as
two
christian
gentlemen
receive
a
brother
priest
and
i
may
say
that
during
my
stay
in
the
monastery
they
constantly
overwhelmed
me
with
the
most
sincere
marks
of
kindness
i
found
in
them
both
the
very
best
types
of
priests
of
rome
a
volume
and
not
a
chapter
would
be
required
were
i
to
tell
what
i
saw
there
of
the
zeal
devotedness
ability
and
marvellous
success
of
their
labors
suffice
it
to
say
that
grand
vicar
saurin
is
justly
considered
one
of
the
largest
and
highest
intellects
rome
has
ever
given
to
the
united
states
there
is
not
perhaps
a
man
who
has
done
so
much
for
the
advancement
of
that
church
in
this
country
as
that
highly
gifted
priest
my
esteem
respect
i
venture
to
say
my
veneration
for
him
increased
every
time
i
had
the
privilege
of
conversing
with
him
the
only
things
which
pained
me
were
when
some
of
his
inferior
monks
came
to
speak
to
him
they
had
to
kneel
and
prostrate
themselves
as
if
he
had
been
a
god
and
they
had
to
remain
in
that
humble
and
degrading
posture
till
with
a
sign
of
his
hand
or
a
word
from
his
lips
he
told
them
to
rise
though
he
promised
to
the
numerous
protestant
parents
who
entrusted
their
boys
and
girls
to
his
care
for
their
education
never
to
interfere
with
their
religion
he
was
nevertheless
incessantly
proselytizing
them
several
of
his
protestant
pupils
were
received
in
the
church
of
rome
and
renounced
the
religion
of
their
fathers
in
my
presence
on
the
eve
of
easter
of
that
year
while
as
a
priest
i
rejoiced
in
the
numerous
conquests
of
my
church
over
her
enemies
in
all
our
colleges
and
nunneries
i
objected
to
the
breach
of
promise
always
connected
with
those
conversions
i
however
then
thought
as
i
think
that
a
protestant
who
takes
his
children
to
a
roman
catholic
priest
or
nun
for
their
education
had
no
religion
it
is
simply
an
absurdity
to
promise
that
we
will
respect
the
religion
of
a
man
who
has
none
how
can
we
respect
that
which
does
not
exist
as
a
general
thing
there
are
too
few
people
who
understand
the
profound
meaning
of
our
saviour
s
words
to
his
disciples
come
ye
yourselves
apart
into
a
desert
place
and
rest
a
these
words
uttered
after
the
apostles
had
gathered
themselves
together
unto
jesus
and
told
him
all
things
both
what
they
had
done
and
taught
ought
to
receive
more
attention
on
the
part
of
those
whom
the
son
of
god
has
chosen
to
continue
the
great
work
of
preaching
his
gospel
to
the
world
i
had
never
before
so
well
realized
how
good
it
was
to
be
alone
with
christ
and
tell
him
all
i
had
done
said
and
thought
those
few
days
of
rest
and
communion
with
my
saviour
were
one
of
the
greatest
favors
my
merciful
god
had
ever
given
me
my
principal
occupation
was
to
read
and
meditate
on
the
gospel
that
divine
book
had
never
been
so
precious
to
me
as
since
god
had
directed
me
to
put
it
as
the
fundamental
stone
of
my
faith
in
the
act
of
submission
i
had
just
given
to
my
bishop
and
my
church
had
never
been
so
dear
to
me
as
since
she
had
accepted
that
conditional
submission
i
felt
a
holy
pride
and
joy
at
having
finally
silenced
the
voice
of
the
enemy
which
so
often
troubled
my
faith
by
crying
to
my
soul
do
you
not
see
that
in
your
church
of
rome
you
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
only
the
lying
traditions
of
my
church
through
her
bishop
had
just
given
me
what
i
considered
an
infallible
assurance
of
the
contrary
by
accepting
the
document
signed
by
me
and
my
people
where
we
had
clearly
said
that
we
would
never
obey
any
authority
or
any
superior
except
when
their
orders
or
doctrines
would
be
based
upon
the
gospel
of
my
soul
was
rejoicing
in
those
thoughts
when
on
the
of
april
monday
after
easter
grand
vicar
saurin
handed
me
a
letter
from
dunn
telling
me
that
a
new
storm
brought
by
the
jesuits
and
more
formidable
than
the
past
ones
was
about
to
break
on
me
that
i
had
to
prepare
for
new
and
more
serious
conflicts
than
i
had
ever
experienced
the
next
morning
saurin
handed
me
another
letter
from
the
bishop
of
dubuque
and
with
a
sympathy
which
i
will
never
forget
he
said
i
am
sorry
to
see
that
you
are
not
at
the
end
of
your
troubles
as
you
expected
bishop
smith
orders
you
back
to
dubuque
with
words
which
are
far
from
being
but
strange
to
say
such
bad
news
which
would
have
saddened
and
discouraged
me
in
other
circumstances
left
me
perfectly
calm
and
cheerful
on
that
day
in
my
dear
gospel
which
had
been
my
daily
bread
the
last
eight
days
i
had
found
the
helmet
for
my
head
the
breastplate
and
the
shield
to
protect
me
and
the
unconquerable
sword
with
which
to
fight
from
every
page
i
heard
my
saviour
s
voice
fear
not
i
am
with
when
on
my
way
back
to
dubuque
i
stopped
at
chicago
to
know
from
my
faithful
friend
dunn
the
cause
of
the
new
storm
he
said
you
remember
how
grand
vicar
mailloux
was
displeased
with
the
conditional
submission
you
had
given
to
the
bishop
as
soon
as
we
had
left
him
he
sent
the
young
priest
who
is
with
him
to
the
jesuits
of
chicago
to
tell
them
that
the
authority
of
the
church
and
of
the
bishop
would
be
forever
lost
if
chiniquy
were
allowed
to
submit
on
such
a
condition
he
wanted
them
to
notice
that
it
was
not
to
the
authority
of
the
bishops
and
the
church
you
had
submitted
but
only
to
the
authority
of
the
bible
the
jesuits
were
of
the
same
mind
they
immediately
sent
to
dubuque
and
said
to
the
bishop
do
you
not
see
that
chiniquy
is
a
disguised
protestant
that
he
has
deceived
you
by
presenting
you
such
an
act
of
submission
does
not
your
lordship
see
that
chiniquy
has
not
submitted
himself
to
your
authority
but
to
the
authority
of
his
bible
alone
do
you
not
fear
that
the
whole
body
of
the
bishops
and
the
pope
himself
will
condemn
you
for
having
fallen
into
the
trap
prepared
by
that
disguised
protestant
our
administrator
though
a
good
man
when
left
to
himself
is
weak
and
like
soft
wax
can
be
manipulated
in
every
way
the
jesuits
who
want
to
rule
the
priests
and
the
church
with
an
iron
rod
and
who
are
aiming
to
change
the
pope
and
the
bishops
into
the
most
heartless
tyrants
have
advised
the
administrator
to
force
you
to
give
an
unconditional
act
of
submission
it
is
not
the
word
of
god
which
must
rule
us
now
it
is
the
old
jupiter
who
is
coming
back
to
rule
us
under
the
name
of
a
modern
divinity
called
the
authority
of
the
the
administrator
and
the
jesuits
themselves
have
telegraphed
your
submission
to
several
bishops
who
have
unanimously
answered
that
it
must
be
rejected
and
another
given
without
condition
requested
from
you
you
were
evidently
too
correct
when
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
your
act
of
submission
was
too
good
for
the
bishops
and
the
pope
what
will
you
do
i
replied
i
do
not
know
what
i
will
do
but
be
sure
of
this
my
dear
dunn
i
will
do
what
our
great
and
merciful
god
will
tell
very
well
very
well
he
answered
may
god
help
you
h
footnote
h
that
same
dunn
was
also
excommunicated
not
long
after
by
his
bishop
and
died
after
publicly
refusing
to
be
relieved
from
that
sentence
after
warmly
shaking
hands
with
me
i
left
to
take
the
train
for
dubuque
where
i
arrived
next
morning
i
went
immediately
to
the
bishop
s
palace
i
found
him
in
the
company
of
a
jesuit
and
i
felt
myself
as
a
poor
helpless
ship
between
two
threatening
icebergs
your
lordship
wants
to
see
me
again
i
said
yes
sir
i
want
to
see
you
again
he
answered
what
do
you
want
from
me
my
lord
i
replied
have
you
the
testimonial
letter
i
addressed
to
you
at
chicago
last
week
yes
my
lord
i
have
it
with
will
you
please
show
it
to
me
he
replied
with
pleasure
here
it
is
and
i
handed
him
the
precious
document
as
soon
as
he
had
assured
himself
that
it
was
the
very
letter
in
question
he
ran
to
the
stove
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
i
felt
so
puzzled
at
the
action
of
my
bishop
that
i
remained
almost
paralyzed
but
soon
coming
to
myself
i
ran
to
save
from
the
flames
that
document
which
was
more
valuable
and
precious
to
me
than
all
the
gold
of
california
but
it
was
too
late
it
was
in
ashes
i
turned
to
the
bishop
and
said
how
can
you
take
from
me
a
document
which
is
my
property
and
destroy
it
without
my
permission
he
answered
me
with
an
impudence
that
can
not
be
expressed
on
paper
i
am
your
superior
and
have
no
account
to
give
i
replied
yes
my
lord
you
are
my
superior
indeed
you
are
a
great
bishop
in
our
church
and
i
am
nothing
but
a
poor
miserable
priest
but
there
is
an
almighty
god
in
heaven
who
is
as
much
above
you
as
he
is
above
me
that
great
god
has
granted
me
rights
which
i
will
never
give
up
to
please
any
man
in
the
presence
of
god
i
protest
against
your
have
you
come
here
to
lecture
me
replied
the
bishop
no
my
lord
i
did
not
come
to
lecture
you
i
come
at
your
command
but
i
want
to
know
if
it
was
to
insult
me
as
you
have
just
done
that
you
requested
me
to
come
here
i
ordered
you
to
come
here
again
because
you
deceived
me
the
last
time
you
were
here
he
answered
you
gave
me
an
act
of
submission
which
you
know
very
well
is
not
an
act
of
submission
i
accepted
it
then
but
i
was
mistaken
i
reject
it
i
answered
how
can
you
say
that
i
deceived
you
the
document
i
presented
you
is
written
in
good
plain
english
it
is
there
on
your
table
i
see
it
you
read
it
twice
and
understood
it
well
if
you
were
deceived
by
its
contents
you
deceived
yourself
you
are
then
a
and
you
can
not
accuse
me
of
having
deceived
he
then
took
the
document
read
it
slowly
and
when
at
the
words
we
submit
ourselves
to
your
authority
according
to
the
word
of
god
as
we
find
it
in
the
gospel
of
christ
he
stopped
and
said
what
do
you
mean
by
this
i
answered
i
mean
what
you
see
there
i
mean
that
neither
i
nor
my
people
will
ever
submit
ourselves
to
anybody
except
according
to
the
eternal
laws
of
truth
justice
and
holiness
of
god
as
we
find
them
expressed
in
the
he
angrily
answered
such
language
on
your
part
is
sheer
protestantism
i
can
not
accept
such
a
conditional
submission
from
any
then
again
i
seemed
to
hear
the
mysterious
voice
do
you
not
see
that
in
your
church
of
rome
you
do
not
follow
the
word
of
god
but
the
lying
traditions
of
men
thanks
be
to
god
i
did
not
silence
that
voice
in
that
solemn
hour
an
ardent
though
silent
prayer
went
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
to
the
mercy
seat
with
all
the
fervor
of
my
soul
i
said
oh
my
god
speak
speak
again
to
thy
poor
servant
and
grant
me
the
grace
to
follow
thy
holy
word
i
then
said
to
the
bishop
you
distress
me
by
rejecting
this
act
of
submission
and
asking
another
please
explain
yourself
more
clearly
and
tell
me
the
nature
of
the
new
one
you
require
from
me
and
my
taking
then
a
more
subdued
and
polite
tone
the
bishop
said
i
hope
chiniquy
that
as
a
good
priest
you
do
not
want
to
rebel
against
your
bishop
and
that
you
will
give
me
the
act
of
submission
i
ask
from
you
take
away
these
words
of
god
gospel
of
christ
and
bible
from
your
present
document
and
i
will
be
but
my
lord
with
my
people
i
have
put
these
words
because
we
want
to
obey
only
the
bishops
who
follow
the
word
of
god
we
want
to
submit
only
to
the
church
which
respects
and
follows
the
gospel
of
in
an
irritated
manner
he
quickly
answered
take
away
from
your
act
of
submission
those
words
of
god
and
gospel
of
christ
and
bible
or
i
will
punish
you
as
a
my
lord
i
replied
those
expressions
are
there
to
show
us
and
to
the
whole
world
that
the
word
of
god
the
gospel
of
christ
and
the
bible
are
the
fundamental
stones
of
our
holy
church
if
we
reject
those
precious
stones
on
what
foundations
will
our
church
and
our
faith
rest
he
answered
angrily
mr
chiniquy
i
am
your
superior
i
do
not
want
to
argue
with
you
you
are
my
inferior
your
business
is
to
obey
me
give
me
at
once
an
act
of
submission
in
which
you
will
simply
say
that
you
and
your
people
will
submit
yourselves
to
my
authority
and
promise
to
do
anything
i
will
bid
i
calmly
answered
what
you
ask
me
is
not
an
act
of
submission
it
is
an
act
of
adoration
i
do
absolutely
refuse
to
give
if
it
be
so
sir
he
answered
you
can
no
longer
be
a
roman
catholic
i
raised
my
hands
to
heaven
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
may
god
almighty
be
forever
i
took
my
hat
and
left
to
go
to
my
hotel
when
alone
in
my
room
i
locked
the
door
and
fell
on
my
knees
to
consider
in
the
presence
of
god
what
i
had
just
done
there
the
awful
undeniable
truth
stared
me
in
the
face
my
church
could
not
be
the
church
of
christ
that
sad
truth
had
not
been
revealed
to
me
by
any
protestant
nor
any
other
enemy
of
the
church
it
was
from
her
own
lips
i
had
got
it
it
had
been
told
me
by
one
of
her
most
learned
and
devoted
bishops
my
church
was
the
deadly
the
irreconcilable
enemy
of
the
word
of
god
as
i
had
so
often
suspected
i
was
not
allowed
to
remain
a
single
day
longer
in
that
church
without
positively
and
publicly
giving
up
the
gospel
of
christ
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
gospel
was
only
a
blind
a
mockery
to
conceal
her
iniquities
tyrannies
superstitions
and
idolatries
the
only
use
of
the
gospel
in
my
church
was
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
priests
and
people
it
had
no
authority
the
only
rule
and
guide
were
the
will
the
passions
and
the
dictates
of
sinful
men
there
on
my
knees
and
alone
with
god
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
voice
which
had
so
often
troubled
and
shaken
my
faith
was
the
voice
of
my
merciful
god
who
wanted
to
save
me
it
was
the
voice
of
my
dear
saviour
who
wanted
to
bring
me
out
of
the
ways
of
perdition
in
which
i
was
walking
and
i
had
tried
so
often
to
silence
that
voice
my
god
my
god
i
cried
the
church
of
rome
is
not
thy
church
to
obey
the
voice
of
my
conscience
which
is
thine
i
gave
it
up
when
i
had
the
choice
between
giving
up
the
church
or
the
bible
i
did
not
hesitate
i
could
not
give
up
thy
holy
word
i
have
given
up
rome
but
o
lord
where
is
thy
church
oh
speak
where
must
i
go
to
be
saved
for
more
than
one
hour
i
cried
to
god
in
vain
no
answer
came
in
vain
i
cried
for
a
ray
of
light
to
guide
me
the
more
i
prayed
and
wept
the
greater
was
the
darkness
which
surrounded
me
i
then
felt
as
if
god
had
forsaken
me
and
an
unspeakable
distress
was
the
result
of
that
horrible
thought
to
add
to
my
distress
the
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
that
by
giving
up
the
church
of
rome
i
had
given
up
the
church
of
my
dear
father
and
mother
of
my
brothers
my
friends
and
my
country
in
fact
all
that
was
near
and
dear
to
me
i
hope
that
none
of
my
readers
will
ever
experience
what
it
is
to
give
up
friends
relatives
parents
honor
i
did
not
regret
the
sacrifice
but
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
survive
it
with
tears
i
cried
to
god
for
more
strength
and
faith
to
bear
the
cross
which
was
laid
on
my
too
weak
shoulders
but
all
in
vain
then
i
felt
that
an
implacable
war
was
to
be
declared
against
me
which
would
end
only
with
my
life
the
pope
the
bishops
and
priests
all
over
the
world
would
denounce
and
curse
me
they
would
attack
and
destroy
my
character
my
name
and
my
honor
in
their
press
from
their
pulpit
and
in
their
confessionals
where
the
man
they
strike
can
never
know
whence
the
blow
is
coming
almost
in
despair
i
tried
to
think
of
some
one
who
would
come
to
my
help
in
that
formidable
conflict
but
could
find
none
every
one
of
the
millions
of
roman
catholics
were
bound
to
curse
me
my
best
own
my
own
brothers
were
bound
to
look
upon
me
with
horror
as
an
apostate
a
vile
outcast
could
i
hope
for
help
or
protection
from
protestants
no
for
my
priestly
life
had
been
spent
in
writing
and
preaching
against
them
in
vain
would
i
try
to
give
an
idea
of
the
desolation
i
felt
when
that
thought
struck
my
mind
forsaken
by
god
and
man
what
would
become
of
me
where
would
i
go
when
out
of
that
room
expelled
with
contempt
by
my
former
roman
catholic
friends
repulsed
with
still
more
contempt
by
protestants
where
could
i
go
to
hide
my
shame
and
drag
my
miserable
existence
how
could
i
go
again
into
that
world
where
there
was
no
more
room
for
me
where
there
was
no
hand
to
press
mine
none
to
smile
upon
me
life
suddenly
became
to
me
an
unbearable
burden
my
brain
seemed
to
be
filled
with
burning
coals
i
was
losing
my
mind
yea
death
an
instant
death
seemed
to
me
the
greatest
blessing
in
that
awful
hour
and
will
i
say
it
yes
i
took
my
knife
to
cut
my
throat
and
put
an
end
to
my
miserable
existence
but
my
merciful
god
who
wanted
only
to
humble
me
by
showing
me
my
own
helplessness
stopped
my
hand
and
the
knife
fell
on
the
floor
though
i
felt
the
pangs
of
that
desolation
for
more
than
two
hours
i
constantly
cried
to
god
for
a
ray
of
his
saving
light
for
a
word
telling
me
what
to
do
where
to
go
to
be
saved
at
last
drops
of
cold
sweat
began
to
cover
again
my
face
and
my
whole
body
the
pulsations
of
my
heart
began
to
be
very
slow
and
weak
i
felt
so
feeble
that
i
expected
to
faint
at
any
moment
or
fall
dead
at
first
i
thought
that
death
would
be
a
great
relief
but
then
i
said
to
myself
if
i
die
where
will
i
go
when
there
is
no
faith
nor
a
ray
of
light
to
illumine
my
poor
perishing
soul
oh
my
dear
saviour
i
cried
come
to
my
help
lift
up
the
light
of
thy
reconciled
countenance
upon
in
that
very
instant
i
remembered
that
i
had
my
dear
new
testament
with
me
which
i
used
then
as
now
to
carry
everywhere
the
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
that
i
would
find
in
that
divine
book
the
answer
to
my
prayer
and
light
to
guide
me
through
that
dark
night
to
that
house
of
refuge
and
salvation
after
which
my
soul
was
ardently
longing
with
a
trembling
hand
and
a
praying
heart
i
opened
the
book
at
random
but
no
not
i
my
god
himself
opened
it
for
me
my
eyes
fell
on
these
words
ye
are
bought
with
a
price
be
not
ye
the
servants
of
strange
to
say
those
words
came
to
my
mind
more
as
a
light
than
an
articulated
sound
they
suddenly
but
most
beautifully
and
powerfully
gave
me
as
much
as
a
man
can
know
it
the
knowledge
of
the
great
mystery
of
a
perfect
salvation
through
christ
alone
they
at
once
brought
a
great
and
delightful
calm
to
my
soul
i
said
to
myself
jesus
has
bought
me
then
i
am
his
for
when
i
have
bought
a
thing
it
is
mine
absolutely
mine
jesus
has
bought
me
i
then
belong
to
him
he
alone
has
a
right
over
me
i
do
not
belong
to
the
bishops
to
the
popes
not
even
to
the
church
as
i
have
been
told
till
now
i
belong
to
jesus
and
to
him
alone
his
word
must
be
my
guide
and
my
light
by
day
and
by
night
jesus
has
bought
me
i
said
again
to
myself
then
he
has
saved
me
and
if
so
i
am
saved
perfectly
saved
for
ever
saved
for
jesus
can
not
save
me
by
half
jesus
is
my
god
the
works
of
god
are
perfect
my
salvation
must
then
be
a
perfect
salvation
but
how
has
he
saved
me
what
price
has
he
paid
for
my
poor
guilty
soul
the
answer
came
as
quickly
as
lightning
he
bought
you
with
his
blood
shed
on
the
cross
he
saved
you
by
dying
on
calvary
i
then
said
to
myself
again
if
jesus
has
perfectly
saved
me
by
shedding
his
blood
on
the
cross
i
am
not
saved
as
i
have
thought
and
preached
till
now
by
my
penances
my
prayers
to
mary
and
the
saints
my
confessions
and
indulgences
not
even
by
the
flames
or
purgatory
in
that
instant
all
things
which
as
a
roman
catholic
i
had
to
believe
to
be
the
mummeries
by
which
the
poor
roman
catholics
are
so
cruelly
deceived
the
chaplets
indulgences
scapularies
auricular
confession
invocation
of
the
virgin
holy
water
masses
purgatory
given
as
means
of
salvation
vanished
from
my
mind
as
a
huge
tower
when
struck
at
the
foundation
crumbles
to
the
ground
jesus
alone
remained
in
my
mind
as
the
saviour
of
my
soul
oh
what
joy
i
felt
at
this
simple
but
sublime
truth
but
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
this
joy
should
be
short
it
suddenly
went
away
with
the
beautiful
light
which
had
caused
it
and
my
poor
soul
was
again
wrapped
in
the
most
awful
darkness
how
ever
profound
that
darkness
was
a
still
darker
object
presented
itself
before
my
mind
it
was
as
a
very
high
mountain
but
not
composed
of
sand
or
stones
it
was
the
mountain
of
my
sins
i
saw
them
all
standing
before
me
and
still
more
horrified
was
i
when
i
saw
it
moving
towards
me
as
if
with
a
mighty
hand
to
crush
me
i
tried
to
escape
but
in
vain
i
felt
tied
to
the
floor
and
the
next
moment
it
had
rolled
over
me
i
felt
as
crushed
under
its
weight
for
it
was
as
heavy
as
granite
i
could
scarcely
breathe
my
only
hope
was
to
cry
to
god
for
help
with
a
loud
voice
heard
by
many
in
the
hotel
i
cried
o
my
god
have
mercy
upon
me
my
sins
are
destroying
me
i
am
lost
save
me
but
it
seemed
god
could
not
hear
me
the
mountain
was
between
to
prevent
my
cries
from
reaching
him
and
to
hide
my
tears
i
suddenly
thought
that
god
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
a
sinner
but
to
open
the
gates
of
hell
to
throw
me
into
that
burning
furnace
prepared
for
his
enemies
and
which
i
had
so
richly
deserved
i
was
mistaken
after
eight
or
ten
minutes
of
unspeakable
agony
the
rays
of
a
new
and
beautiful
light
began
to
pierce
through
the
dark
cloud
which
hung
over
me
in
that
light
i
clearly
saw
my
saviour
there
he
was
bent
under
the
weight
of
his
heavy
cross
his
face
was
covered
with
blood
the
crown
of
thorns
was
on
his
head
and
the
nails
in
his
hands
he
was
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
of
compassion
of
love
which
no
tongue
can
describe
coming
to
me
he
said
i
have
heard
thy
cries
i
have
seen
thy
tears
i
come
to
offer
myself
to
thee
as
a
gift
i
offer
thee
my
blood
and
my
bruised
body
as
a
gift
to
pay
thy
debts
wilt
thou
give
me
thy
heart
wilt
thou
take
my
word
for
the
only
lamp
of
thy
feet
and
the
only
light
of
thy
path
i
bring
thee
eternal
life
as
a
gift
i
answered
dear
jesus
how
sweet
art
thy
words
to
my
soul
speak
oh
speak
again
yes
beloved
saviour
i
want
to
love
thee
but
dost
thou
not
see
that
mountain
which
is
crushing
me
oh
remove
it
take
away
my
sins
i
had
not
done
speaking
when
i
saw
his
mighty
hand
stretched
out
he
touched
the
mountain
and
it
rolled
into
the
deep
and
disappeared
at
the
same
time
i
felt
as
if
a
shower
of
the
blood
of
the
lamb
were
falling
upon
me
to
purify
my
soul
and
suddenly
my
humble
room
was
transformed
into
a
real
paradise
the
angels
of
god
could
not
be
more
happy
than
i
was
in
that
most
mysterious
and
blessed
hour
of
my
life
with
an
unspeakable
joy
i
said
to
my
saviour
dear
jesus
the
gift
of
god
i
accept
thee
thou
hast
offered
the
pardon
of
my
sins
as
a
gift
i
accept
the
gift
thou
hast
brought
me
eternal
life
as
a
gift
i
accept
it
thou
hast
redeemed
and
saved
me
beloved
saviour
i
know
i
feel
it
but
this
is
not
enough
i
do
not
want
to
be
saved
alone
save
my
people
also
save
my
whole
country
i
feel
rich
and
happy
in
that
gift
grant
me
to
show
its
beauty
and
preciousness
to
my
people
that
they
may
accept
it
and
rejoice
in
its
this
sudden
revelation
of
that
marvellous
truth
of
salvation
as
a
gift
had
so
completely
transformed
me
that
i
felt
quite
a
new
man
the
unutterable
distress
of
my
soul
had
been
changed
into
an
unspeakable
joy
my
fears
had
gone
away
to
be
replaced
by
a
courage
and
strength
such
as
i
had
never
experienced
the
popes
with
their
bishops
and
priests
and
millions
of
abject
slaves
might
now
attack
me
i
felt
that
i
was
a
match
for
them
all
my
great
ambition
was
to
go
back
to
my
people
and
tell
them
what
the
lord
had
done
to
save
my
soul
i
washed
my
tears
away
paid
my
bill
and
took
the
train
which
brought
me
back
into
the
midst
of
my
dear
countrymen
at
that
very
same
hour
they
were
anxious
and
excited
for
they
had
just
received
at
kankakee
city
a
telegram
from
the
bishop
of
dubuque
telling
them
turn
away
your
priest
for
he
has
refused
to
give
me
an
unconditional
act
of
they
had
gathered
in
great
numbers
to
hear
the
reading
of
that
strange
message
but
they
unanimously
said
if
chiniquy
has
refused
to
give
an
unconditional
act
of
submission
he
has
done
right
we
will
stand
by
him
to
the
however
i
knew
nothing
of
that
admirable
resolution
i
arrived
at
anne
on
a
sabbath
day
at
the
hour
of
the
morning
service
there
was
an
immense
crowd
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
they
rushed
to
me
and
said
you
are
just
coming
from
the
bishop
what
good
news
have
you
to
bring
us
i
answered
no
news
here
my
good
friends
come
to
the
chapel
and
i
will
tell
you
what
the
lord
has
done
for
my
when
they
had
filled
the
large
building
i
told
them
our
saviour
the
day
before
his
death
said
to
his
disciples
i
will
be
a
scandal
to
you
this
i
must
tell
you
the
same
thing
i
will
be
i
fear
the
cause
of
a
great
scandal
to
every
one
of
you
but
as
the
scandal
which
christ
gave
to
his
disciples
has
saved
the
world
i
hope
that
by
the
great
mercy
of
god
the
scandal
i
will
give
you
will
save
you
i
was
your
pastor
till
yesterday
but
i
have
no
more
that
honor
for
i
have
broken
the
ties
by
which
i
was
bound
as
a
slave
at
the
feet
of
the
bishops
and
of
the
this
sentence
was
scarcely
finished
when
a
universal
cry
of
surprise
and
sadness
filled
the
church
oh
what
does
that
mean
exclaimed
the
congregation
my
dear
countrymen
i
added
i
have
not
come
to
tell
you
to
follow
me
i
did
not
die
to
save
your
immortal
souls
i
have
not
shed
my
blood
to
buy
you
a
place
in
heaven
but
christ
has
done
it
then
follow
christ
and
him
alone
now
i
must
tell
you
why
i
have
broken
the
ignominious
and
unbearable
yoke
of
men
to
follow
christ
you
remember
that
on
the
of
march
last
you
signed
with
me
an
act
of
submission
to
the
authority
of
the
bishop
of
the
church
of
rome
with
the
conditional
clause
that
we
would
obey
them
only
in
matters
which
were
according
to
the
teachings
of
the
word
of
god
as
found
in
the
gospel
of
christ
in
that
act
of
submission
we
did
not
want
to
be
slaves
of
any
man
but
the
servants
of
god
the
followers
of
the
gospel
it
was
our
hope
then
that
our
church
would
accept
such
a
submission
and
your
joy
was
great
when
you
heard
that
grand
vicar
dunn
was
here
on
the
of
march
to
tell
you
that
bishop
smith
had
accepted
the
submission
but
that
acceptation
was
revoked
yesterday
i
was
told
in
the
presence
of
god
by
the
same
bishop
that
he
ought
not
to
have
accepted
an
act
of
submission
from
any
priest
or
people
based
on
the
gospel
of
christ
yes
yesterday
bishop
smith
rejected
with
the
utmost
contempt
the
act
of
submission
we
had
given
him
and
which
he
had
accepted
only
two
weeks
ago
because
the
word
of
god
was
mentioned
in
it
when
i
respectfully
requested
him
to
tell
me
the
nature
of
the
new
act
of
submission
he
wanted
from
us
he
ordered
me
to
take
away
from
it
the
word
of
god
the
gospel
of
christ
and
the
bible
if
we
wanted
to
be
accepted
as
good
catholics
we
had
thought
till
then
that
the
sacred
word
of
god
and
the
holy
gospel
of
christ
were
the
fundamental
and
precious
stones
of
the
church
of
rome
we
loved
her
on
that
account
we
wanted
to
remain
in
her
bosom
even
when
we
were
forced
to
fight
as
honest
men
against
that
tyrant
o
regan
believing
that
the
church
of
rome
was
the
child
of
the
word
of
god
that
it
was
the
most
precious
fruit
of
the
divine
tree
planted
on
the
earth
under
the
name
of
the
gospel
we
would
have
given
the
last
drop
of
our
blood
to
defend
her
but
yesterday
i
have
learned
from
the
very
lips
of
the
bishops
of
rome
that
we
were
a
band
of
simpletons
in
believing
those
things
i
have
learned
that
the
church
of
rome
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
of
god
except
to
throw
it
overboard
to
trample
it
under
their
feet
and
to
forbid
us
even
to
name
it
in
the
solemn
act
of
submission
we
had
given
i
have
been
told
that
we
could
no
longer
be
roman
catholics
if
we
persisted
in
putting
the
word
of
god
and
the
gospel
of
christ
as
the
foundation
of
our
religion
our
faith
and
our
submission
when
i
was
told
by
the
bishop
that
i
had
either
to
renounce
the
word
of
god
as
the
base
of
my
submission
or
the
title
of
priest
of
rome
i
did
not
hesitate
nothing
could
induce
me
to
give
up
the
gospel
of
christ
and
so
i
gave
up
the
title
and
position
of
priest
in
the
roman
catholic
church
i
would
rather
suffer
a
thousand
deaths
than
renounce
the
gospel
of
christ
i
am
no
longer
a
priest
of
rome
but
i
am
more
than
ever
a
disciple
of
christ
a
follower
of
the
gospel
that
gospel
is
for
me
what
it
was
for
paul
the
power
of
god
unto
it
is
the
bread
of
my
soul
in
it
we
can
satisfy
our
thirst
with
the
waters
of
eternal
life
no
no
i
could
not
buy
the
honor
of
being
any
longer
a
slave
to
the
bishops
and
popes
of
rome
by
giving
up
the
gospel
of
christ
when
i
requested
the
bishop
to
give
me
the
precise
form
of
submission
he
wanted
from
us
he
answered
give
me
an
act
of
submission
without
any
condition
and
promise
that
you
will
do
anything
i
bid
i
replied
this
is
not
an
act
of
submission
it
is
an
act
of
adoration
i
will
never
give
it
to
you
if
so
he
said
you
can
no
longer
be
a
roman
catholic
i
raised
my
hands
to
heaven
and
with
a
loud
and
cheerful
voice
i
said
may
god
almighty
be
forever
i
then
told
them
something
of
my
desolation
when
alone
in
my
room
of
the
granite
mountain
which
had
been
rolled
over
my
shoulders
of
my
tears
and
of
my
despair
i
told
them
also
how
my
bleeding
dying
crucified
saviour
had
brought
me
the
forgiveness
of
my
sins
how
he
had
offered
me
eternal
salvation
as
a
gift
and
how
rich
strong
and
happy
i
felt
in
that
gift
i
then
offered
them
the
gift
and
besought
them
to
accept
it
my
address
lasted
more
than
two
hours
and
god
blessed
it
in
a
marvellous
way
its
effects
were
profound
and
lasting
but
it
is
too
long
to
describe
here
in
substance
i
said
i
respect
you
too
much
to
impose
myself
upon
your
honest
consciences
or
to
dictate
what
you
ought
to
do
on
this
most
solemn
occasion
i
feel
that
the
hour
has
come
for
me
to
make
a
great
sacrifice
i
must
leave
you
but
no
i
will
not
go
away
before
you
tell
me
to
do
so
you
will
yourselves
break
the
ties
so
dear
which
have
united
us
please
pay
attention
to
these
my
parting
words
if
you
think
it
is
better
for
you
to
follow
the
pope
than
to
follow
christ
that
it
is
better
to
trust
in
the
works
of
your
hands
and
in
your
own
merits
than
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
shed
on
the
cross
to
be
saved
if
you
think
it
is
better
for
you
to
follow
the
traditions
of
men
than
the
gospel
and
if
you
believe
that
it
is
better
for
you
to
have
a
priest
of
rome
who
will
keep
you
tied
as
slaves
to
the
feet
of
the
bishops
and
who
will
preach
to
you
the
ordinances
of
men
rather
than
have
me
preach
to
you
nothing
but
the
pure
word
of
god
as
we
find
it
in
the
gospel
of
christ
tell
it
to
me
by
rising
up
and
i
will
go
but
to
my
great
surprise
nobody
moved
the
chapel
was
filled
with
sobs
tears
were
flowing
from
every
eye
but
not
one
moved
to
tell
me
to
leave
them
i
was
puzzled
for
though
i
had
hoped
that
many
enlightened
by
the
copies
of
the
new
testament
i
had
given
them
tired
of
the
tyranny
of
the
bishops
and
disgusted
with
the
superstitions
of
rome
would
be
glad
to
break
the
yoke
with
me
to
follow
christ
i
was
afraid
that
the
greatest
number
would
not
dare
to
break
their
allegiance
to
the
church
and
publicly
give
up
her
authority
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
during
which
i
mixed
my
tears
and
my
sobs
with
those
of
my
people
i
told
them
why
do
you
not
at
once
rise
up
and
tell
me
to
go
you
see
that
i
can
no
longer
remain
your
pastor
after
renouncing
the
tyranny
of
the
bishops
and
the
traditions
of
men
to
follow
the
gospel
of
christ
as
my
only
rule
why
do
you
not
bravely
tell
me
to
go
away
but
this
new
appeal
was
still
without
any
answer
i
was
filled
with
astonishment
however
it
was
evident
to
me
that
a
great
and
mysterious
change
was
wrought
in
that
multitude
their
countenances
their
manners
were
completely
changed
they
were
speaking
to
me
with
their
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
their
manly
faces
beaming
with
joy
their
sobs
in
some
way
told
me
that
they
were
filled
with
new
light
that
they
were
full
of
new
strength
and
ready
to
make
the
most
heroic
sacrifices
and
break
their
fetters
to
follow
christ
and
him
alone
there
was
something
in
those
brave
honest
and
happy
faces
which
was
telling
me
more
effectually
than
the
most
eloquent
speech
we
have
accepted
the
gift
we
want
to
be
rich
happy
free
and
saved
in
the
gift
we
do
not
want
anything
else
remain
among
us
and
help
us
to
love
both
the
gift
and
the
giver
a
thought
suddenly
flashed
across
my
mind
and
with
an
inexpressible
sentiment
of
hope
and
joy
i
told
them
my
dear
countrymen
the
mighty
god
who
gave
me
his
saving
light
yesterday
can
grant
you
the
same
favor
he
can
as
well
save
a
thousand
souls
as
one
i
see
in
your
noble
and
christian
faces
that
you
do
not
want
any
more
to
be
slaves
of
men
you
want
to
be
the
free
children
of
god
intelligent
followers
of
the
gospel
the
light
is
shining
and
you
like
it
the
gift
of
god
has
been
offered
to
you
and
you
have
accepted
it
with
me
you
will
break
the
fetters
of
a
captivity
worse
than
that
of
egypt
to
follow
the
gospel
of
christ
and
take
possession
of
the
promised
land
let
all
those
who
think
it
is
better
to
follow
jesus
christ
than
the
pope
better
to
follow
the
word
of
god
than
the
traditions
of
men
let
all
those
of
you
who
want
me
to
remain
here
and
preach
to
you
nothing
but
the
word
of
god
as
we
find
it
in
the
gospel
of
christ
tell
it
to
me
by
rising
up
i
am
your
man
rise
up
without
a
single
exception
that
multitude
arose
more
than
a
thousand
of
my
countrymen
had
forever
broken
their
fetters
they
had
crossed
the
red
sea
and
exchanged
the
servitude
of
egypt
for
the
blessings

of
the
cries
of
the
people
where
shall
i
find
words
to
express
the
sentiments
of
surprise
admiration
and
joy
i
felt
when
after
divine
service
alone
in
my
humble
study
i
considered
in
the
presence
of
god
what
his
mighty
hand
had
just
wrought
under
my
eyes
the
people
who
surrounded
the
saviour
when
he
cried
to
lazarus
to
come
forth
were
not
more
amazed
at
seeing
the
dead
coming
out
of
his
grave
than
i
was
when
i
had
seen
not
one
but
more
than
a
thousand
of
my
countrymen
so
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
coming
out
from
the
grave
of
the
degrading
slavery
in
which
they
were
born
and
brought
up
no
the
heart
of
moses
was
not
filled
with
more
joy
than
mine
when
on
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
he
sang
his
sublime
hymns
i
will
sing
unto
the
lord
for
he
hath
triumphed
gloriously
the
horse
and
his
rider
hath
he
thrown
into

the
lord
is
my
strength
and
song
and
he
is
become
my
salvation
he
is
my
god
and
i
will
prepare
him
an
habitation
my
fathers
god
and
i
will
exalt
my
joy
was
however
suddenly
changed
into
confusion
when
i
considered
the
unworthiness
of
the
instrument
which
god
had
chosen
to
do
that
work
i
felt
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
most
remarkable
religious
reform
which
had
ever
occurred
on
this
continent
of
america
and
i
was
dismayed
at
the
thought
of
such
a
task
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
i
was
called
to
guide
my
people
into
regions
entirely
new
and
unexplored
the
terrible
difficulties
which
luther
calvin
and
knox
had
met
at
almost
every
step
were
to
meet
me
though
giants
they
had
at
many
times
been
brought
low
and
almost
discouraged
in
their
new
positions
what
would
become
of
me
seeing
that
i
was
so
deficient
in
knowledge
wisdom
and
experience
many
times
during
the
first
night
after
the
deliverance
of
my
people
from
the
bondage
of
the
pope
i
said
to
my
god
in
tears
why
hast
not
thou
chosen
a
more
worthy
instrument
of
thy
mercies
towards
my
brethren
i
would
have
shrank
before
the
task
had
not
god
said
to
me
in
his
word
for
ye
see
your
calling
brethren
how
that
not
many
wise
men
after
the
flesh
not
many
mighty
not
many
noble
are
called
but
god
hath
chosen
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
wise
and
god
hath
chosen
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
and
base
things
of
the
world
and
things
which
are
despised
hath
god
chosen
yea
the
things
which
are
not
to
bring
to
naught
the
things
which
are
that
no
flesh
should
glory
in
his
cor
these
words
calmed
my
fears
and
gave
me
new
courage
next
morning
i
said
to
myself
is
it
not
god
alone
who
has
done
the
great
things
of
yesterday
why
should
i
not
rely
upon
him
for
the
things
which
remain
to
be
done
i
am
weak
it
is
true
but
he
is
strong
and
mighty
i
am
unwise
but
he
is
the
god
of
light
and
wisdom
i
am
sinful
but
he
is
the
god
of
holiness
he
wants
the
world
to
know
that
he
is
the
it
would
make
the
most
interesting
book
were
i
to
tell
all
the
marvellous
episodes
of
the
new
battle
my
dear
countrymen
and
i
had
to
fight
against
rome
in
those
stormy
but
blessed
days
let
me
ask
my
readers
to
come
with
me
to
that
roman
catholic
family
and
see
the
surprise
and
desolation
of
the
wife
and
children
when
the
father
returned
from
public
service
and
said
my
dear
wife
and
children
i
have
forever
left
the
church
of
rome
and
hope
that
you
will
do
the
same
the
ignominious
chains
by
which
we
were
tied
as
the
slaves
of
the
bishops
and
of
the
pope
are
broken
christ
jesus
alone
will
reign
over
us
now
his
holy
word
alone
will
rule
and
guide
us
salvation
is
a
gift
i
have
accepted
it
and
am
happy
in
its
in
another
house
the
husband
had
not
been
able
to
come
to
church
but
the
wife
and
children
had
it
was
now
the
wife
who
announced
to
her
husband
that
she
had
forever
renounced
the
usurped
authority
of
the
bishops
and
the
pope
and
that
it
was
her
firm
resolution
to
obey
no
other
master
than
christ
and
accept
no
other
religion
than
the
one
taught
in
the
gospel
at
first
this
was
considered
only
as
a
joke
but
as
soon
as
it
was
realized
to
be
a
fact
there
were
in
many
places
confusion
tears
angry
words
and
bitter
discussions
but
the
god
of
truth
light
and
salvation
was
there
and
as
it
was
his
work
the
storms
were
soon
calmed
the
tears
dried
and
peace
restored
a
week
had
scarcely
passed
when
the
gospel
cause
had
achieved
one
of
the
most
glorious
victories
over
its
implacable
enemy
the
pope
in
a
few
days
out
of
families
which
were
around
me
in
anne
had
not
only
accepted
the
gospel
of
christ
as
their
only
authority
in
religion
but
had
publicly
given
up
the
name
of
roman
catholics
to
call
themselves
christian
catholics
a
few
months
later
a
romish
priest
legally
questioned
on
the
subject
by
the
judge
of
kankakee
had
to
swear
that
only
fifteen
families
had
remained
roman
catholics
in
anne
a
most
admirable
feature
of
this
religious
movement
was
the
strong
determination
of
those
who
had
never
been
taught
to
read
to
lose
no
time
in
acquiring
the
privilege
of
reading
for
themselves
the
divine
gospel
which
had
made
them
free
from
the
bondage
of
man
half
of
the
people
had
never
been
taught
to
read
while
in
canada
but
as
their
children
were
attending
the
schools
we
had
established
in
different
parts
of
the
colony
every
house
as
well
as
our
chapel
on
sabbath
days
was
soon
turned
into
a
school
house
where
our
school
boys
and
girls
were
the
teachers
and
the
fathers
and
mothers
the
pupils
in
a
short
time
there
were
but
few
except
those
who
refused
to
leave
rome
who
could
not
read
for
themselves
the
holy
word
of
god
but
however
great
the
victory
we
had
gained
over
the
pope
it
was
not
yet
complete
it
was
true
that
the
enemy
had
received
a
deadly
wound
the
beast
with
the
seven
heads
had
its
principal
one
severed
the
usurped
authority
of
the
bishops
had
been
destroyed
and
the
people
had
determined
to
accept
none
but
the
authority
of
christ
but
many
false
notions
drank
with
the
milk
of
their
mothers
had
been
retained
many
errors
and
superstitions
still
remained
in
their
minds
as
a
mist
after
the
rising
of
the
sun
to
prevent
them
from
seeing
clearly
the
saving
light
of
the
gospel
it
was
my
duty
to
destroy
those
superstitions
and
root
out
these
noxious
weeds
but
i
knew
the
formidable
difficulties
the
reformers
of
the
century
had
met
the
deplorable
divisions
which
had
spread
among
them
and
the
scandals
which
had
so
seriously
retarded
and
compromised
the
reformation
i
cried
to
god
for
wisdom
and
strength
never
had
i
understood
so
clearly
as
i
did
at
that
most
solemn
and
difficult
epoch
of
my
life
the
truth
that
prayer
is
to
the
troubled
mind
what
oil
is
to
the
raging
waves
of
the
sea
my
people
and
i
as
are
all
roman
catholics
were
much
given
to
the
worship
of
images
and
statues
there
were
fourteen
beautiful
pictures
hung
on
the
walls
of
our
chapel
called
the
way
of
the
cross
on
which
the
circumstances
of
the
passion
of
jesus
christ
were
represented
each
surmounted
with
a
cross
one
of
our
favorite
devotional
exercises
was
to
kneel
three
or
four
times
a
week
before
them
prostrate
ourselves
and
say
with
a
loud
voice
oh
holy
cross
we
adore
we
used
to
address
our
most
fervent
prayers
to
them
as
if
they
could
hear
us
asking
them
to
change
our
hearts
and
purify
our
souls
our
blind
devotions
were
so
sincere
that
we
used
to
bow
our
heads
to
the
ground
before
them
i
may
say
the
same
of
a
beautiful
statue
or
rather
idol
of
the
virgin
mary
represented
as
a
child
learning
to
read
at
the
feet
of
her
mother
anne
the
group
was
a
masterpiece
of
art
sent
to
me
by
some
rich
friends
from
montreal
not
long
after
i
had
left
that
city
to
form
the
colony
of
anne
in
we
had
frequently
addressed
our
most
fervent
prayers
to
those
statues
but
after
the
blessed
pentecost
on
which
we
had
broken
the
yoke
of
the
pope
i
never
entered
my
church
without
blushing
at
the
sight
of
those
idols
on
the
altar
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
the
pictures
crosses
and
images
removed
but
dare
not
lay
hands
suddenly
on
them
i
was
afraid
lest
i
should
do
harm
to
some
of
my
people
who
it
seemed
to
me
were
yet
too
weak
in
their
religious
views
to
bear
it
i
was
just
then
reading
how
knox
and
calvin
had
made
bonfires
of
all
those
relics
of
old
paganism
and
i
wished
i
could
do
the
same
but
i
felt
like
jacob
who
could
not
follow
the
rapid
march
of
his
brother
esau
towards
the
land
of
seir
the
children
were
tender
and
the
flocks
and
herds
were
young
if
men
had
overdriven
them
one
day
all
the
flocks
would
have
our
merciful
god
saw
the
perplexity
in
which
i
was
and
taught
me
how
to
get
rid
of
those
idols
without
harming
the
weak
one
sabbath
on
which
i
preached
on
the
commandment
thou
shalt
not
make
unto
thyself
any
graven
image
i
remained
in
the
chapel
to
pray
after
the
people
had
left
i
looked
up
to
the
group
of
statues
on
the
altar
and
said
to
them
my
good
ladies
you
must
come
down
from
that
high
position
god
almighty
alone
is
worshipped
here
now
if
you
could
walk
out
of
this
place
i
would
politely
invite
you
to
do
it
but
you
are
nothing
but
mute
deaf
blind
and
motionless
idols
you
have
eyes
but
you
can
not
see
ears
but
you
can
not
hear
feet
but
you
can
not
walk
what
will
i
do
with
you
now
your
reign
has
come
to
an
it
suddenly
came
to
my
mind
that
when
i
had
put
these
statues
on
their
high
pedestal
i
had
tied
them
with
a
very
slender
but
strong
silk
cord
to
prevent
them
from
falling
i
said
to
myself
if
i
were
to
cut
that
string
the
idols
would
surely
fall
the
first
day
the
people
would
shake
the
floor
when
entering
or
going
their
fall
and
destruction
would
then
scandalize
no
one
i
took
my
knife
and
scaled
the
altar
cut
the
string
and
said
now
my
good
ladies
take
care
of
yourself
especially
when
the
chapel
is
shaken
by
the
wind
or
the
coming
in
of
the
i
never
witnessed
a
more
hearty
laugh
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
religious
services
on
the
next
sabbath
the
chapel
being
shaken
by
the
action
of
the
whole
people
who
fell
on
their
knees
to
pray
the
two
idols
deprived
of
their
silk
support
after
a
couple
of
jerks
which
in
former
days
we
might
have
taken
for
a
friendly
greeting
fell
down
with
a
loud
crash
and
broke
into
fragments
old
and
young
strong
and
weak
and
even
babes
in
the
faith
after
laughing
to
their
heart
s
content
at
the
sad
end
of
their
idols
said
to
each
other
how
foolish
and
blind
were
we
to
put
our
trust
in
and
pray
to
these
idols
that
they
might
protect
us
when
they
can
not
take
care
of
themselves
the
last
vestige
of
idol
worship
among
our
dear
converts
disappeared
for
ever
with
the
dust
and
broken
fragments
of
these
poor
helpless
statues
the
very
next
day
the
people
themselves
took
away
all
the
images
before
which
they
had
so
often
abjectly
prostrated
themselves
and
destroyed
them
from
the
beginning
of
this
movement
it
had
been
my
plan
to
let
the
people
draw
their
own
conclusions
as
much
as
possible
from
their
own
study
of
the
holy
scriptures
i
used
to
direct
their
steps
in
such
a
way
that
they
might
understand
that
i
was
myself
led
with
them
by
the
mighty
and
merciful
arm
of
god
in
our
new
ways
it
was
also
evident
to
me
that
from
the
beginning
the
great
majority
after
searching
the
scriptures
with
prayerful
attention
had
found
out
that
purgatory
was
a
diabolical
invention
used
by
the
priests
of
rome
to
enrich
themselves
at
the
expense
of
their
poor
blind
slaves
but
i
was
also
convinced
that
quite
a
number
were
not
yet
altogether
free
from
that
imposture
i
did
not
know
how
to
attack
and
destroy
that
error
without
wounding
and
injuring
some
of
the
weak
children
of
the
gospel
after
much
praying
i
thought
that
the
best
way
to
clear
the
clouds
which
were
still
hovering
around
the
feeblest
intelligences
was
to
have
recourse
to
the
following
device
the
day
had
come
when
it
was
the
usage
to
take
up
collections
for
the
sake
of
having
prayers
and
masses
said
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
i
then
said
to
the
people
from
the
pulpit
you
have
been
used
from
your
infancy
to
collect
money
in
order
to
have
prayers
said
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
since
we
have
left
the
church
of
rome
for
the
church
of
christ
we
have
spent
many
pleasant
hours
together
in
reading
and
meditating
upon
the
gospel
you
know
that
we
have
not
found
in
it
a
single
word
about
purgatory
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
that
divine
book
we
have
learned
that
it
was
only
through
the
blood
of
the
lamb
shed
on
the
cross
that
our
guilty
souls
could
be
purified
from
their
sins
i
know
however
that
a
few
of
you
have
retained
something
of
the
views
taught
to
you
when
in
the
church
of
rome
concerning
purgatory
i
do
not
want
to
trouble
them
by
useless
discussions
on
the
subject
or
by
refusing
the
money
they
want
to
give
for
the
souls
of
their
dear
departed
parents
and
friends
the
only
thing
i
want
to
do
is
this
you
used
to
have
a
small
box
passed
to
you
to
receive
that
money
instead
of
one
box
two
boxes
will
be
passed
one
white
the
other
black
those
who
like
myself
do
not
believe
in
purgatory
will
put
their
donations
in
the
white
box
and
the
money
will
be
given
to
the
poor
widows
and
orphans
of
the
parish
to
help
them
to
get
food
and
clothing
for
next
winter
those
of
you
who
still
believe
in
purgatory
will
put
their
money
into
the
black
box
for
the
benefit
of
the
dead
the
only
favor
i
ask
of
them
is
that
they
should
tell
me
how
to
convey
their
donations
to
their
departed
friends
i
tell
you
frankly
that
the
money
you
give
to
the
priests
never
goes
to
the
benefit
of
the
souls
of
purgatory
the
priests
everywhere
keep
that
money
for
their
own
bread
and
my
remarks
were
followed
by
a
general
smile
dollars
were
put
in
the
white
box
for
the
orphans
and
widows
and
not
a
cent
fell
into
the
box
for
the
souls
of
purgatory
from
that
day
by
the
great
mercy
of
god
our
dear
converts
were
perfectly
rid
of
the
ridiculous
and
sacrilegious
belief
in
purgatory
that
is
the
way
i
have
dealt
with
all
the
errors
and
idolatries
of
rome
we
had
two
public
meetings
every
week
when
our
chapel
was
as
well
filled
as
on
sabbath
after
the
religious
exercises
every
one
had
the
liberty
to
question
me
and
argue
on
the
various
subjects
announced
at
the
last
meeting
the
doctrines
of
auricular
confession
prayers
in
an
unknown
language
the
mass
holy
water
and
indulgences
were
calmly
examined
discussed
and
thrown
overboard
one
after
the
other
in
a
very
short
time
the
good
done
in
those
public
discussions
was
incalculable
our
dear
converts
not
only
learned
the
great
truths
of
christianity
but
they
learned
also
how
to
defend
and
preach
them
to
their
relations
friends
and
neighbors
many
would
come
from
long
distances
to
see
for
themselves
that
strange
religious
movement
which
was
making
so
much
noise
all
over
the
country
it
is
needless
to
say
that
few
of
them
went
back
without
having
received
some
rays
of
the
saving
light
which
the
sun
of
righteousness
was
so
abundantly
pouring
upon
me
and
my
dear
brethren
of
anne
three
months
after
our
exit
from
the
land
of
bondage
we
were
not
less
than
six
thousand
french
canadians
marching
towards
the
promised
land
how
can
i
express
the
joy
of
my
soul
when
under
cover
of
the
darkness
of
night
i
was
silently
pacing
the
streets
of
our
town
i
heard
from
almost
every
house
sounds
of
reading
the
holy
scriptures
or
the
melodies
of
our
delightful
french
hymns
how
many
times
did
i
then
uniting
my
feeble
voice
with
that
old
prophet
say
in
the
rapture
of
my
joy
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
bless
his
holy
but
it
was
necessary
that
such
a
great
and
blessed
work
should
be
tried
gold
can
not
be
purified
without
going
through
the
fire
on
the
of
july
a
devoted
priest
through
my
friend
dunn
of
chicago
sent
me
the
following
copy
of
a
letter
written
by
the
roman
catholic
bishop
of
illinois
my
lord
duggan
to
several
of
his
the
schism
of
the
apostate
chiniquy
is
spreading
with
an
incredible
and
most
irresistible
velocity
i
am
told
that
he
has
not
less
than
ten
thousand
followers
from
his
countrymen
though
i
hope
that
this
number
is
an
exaggeration
it
shows
that
the
evil
is
great
and
that
we
must
not
lose
any
time
in
trying
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
deluded
people
he
is
leading
to
perdition
i
intend
to
visit
the
very
citadel
of
that
deplorable
schism
next
tuesday
the
of
august
as
i
speak
french
almost
as
well
as
english
i
will
address
the
deluded
people
of
anne
in
their
own
language
my
intention
is
to
unmask
chiniquy
and
show
what
kind
of
a
man
he
is
then
i
will
show
the
people
the
folly
of
believing
that
they
can
read
and
interpret
the
scriptures
by
their
own
private
judgment
after
which
i
will
easily
show
them
that
out
of
the
church
of
rome
there
is
no
salvation
pray
to
the
blessed
virgin
mary
that
she
may
help
me
reclaim
that
poor
deceived
having
read
that
letter
to
the
people
on
the
first
sabbath
of
august
i
said
we
know
man
only
after
he
has
been
tried
so
we
know
the
faith
of
a
christian
only
after
it
has
been
through
the
fire
of
tribulations
i
thank
god
that
next
tuesday
will
be
the
day
chosen
by
him
to
show
the
world
that
you
are
worthy
of
being
in
the
front
rank
of
the
great
army
jesus
christ
is
gathering
to
fight
his
implacable
enemy
the
pope
on
this
continent
let
every
one
of
you
come
and
hear
what
the
bishop
has
to
say
not
only
those
who
are
in
good
health
must
come
but
even
the
sick
must
be
brought
and
hear
and
judge
for
themselves
if
the
bishop
fulfills
his
promise
to
show
you
that
i
am
a
depraved
and
wicked
man
you
must
turn
me
out
you
must
give
up
or
burn
your
bibles
at
his
bidding
if
he
proves
that
you
have
neither
the
right
to
read
nor
the
intelligence
to
understand
them
and
if
he
shows
you
that
out
of
the
church
of
rome
there
is
no
salvation
you
must
without
an
hour
s
delay
return
to
that
church
and
submit
yourselves
to
the
pope
s
bishops
but
if
he
fails
as
he
surely
will
do
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
next
tuesday
will
be
a
most
glorious
day
for
us
all
a
great
and
decisive
battle
will
be
fought
here
such
as
this
continent
has
never
witnessed
between
the
great
principles
of
christian
truth
and
liberty
and
the
principles
of
lies
and
tyranny
of
the
pope
i
have
only
one
word
more
to
say
from
this
moment
to
the
solemn
hour
of
the
conflict
let
us
humbly
but
fervently
ask
our
great
god
through
his
beloved
and
eternal
son
to
look
down
upon
us
in
his
mercy
enlighten
and
strengthen
us
that
we
may
be
true
to
him
to
ourselves
and
to
his
gospel
and
then
the
angels
of
heaven
will
unite
with
all
the
elects
of
god
on
earth
to
bless
you
for
the
great
and
glorious
victory
you
will
never
had
the
sun
shone
more
brightly
on
our
beautiful
hill
than
on
the
of
august
the
hearts
had
never
felt
so
happy
and
the
faces
had
never
been
so
perfectly
the
mirrors
of
joyful
minds
as
on
that
day
among
the
multitudes
which
began
to
gather
from
every
corner
of
the
colony
a
little
after
o
clock
noon
seeing
that
our
chapel
though
very
large
would
not
be
able
to
contain
half
the
audience
we
had
raised
a
large
and
solid
platform
ten
feet
high
in
the
middle
of
the
public
square
in
front
of
the
chapel
we
covered
it
with
carpets
and
put
a
sofa
with
a
good
number
of
chairs
for
the
bishop
his
long
suite
of
priests
and
one
for
myself
and
a
large
table
for
the
different
books
of
references
i
wanted
to
have
at
hand
to
answer
the
bishop
at
about
o
clock
we
perceived
his
carriage
followed
by
several
others
filled
with
priests
he
was
dressed
in
his
white
surplices
and
his
official
bonnet
quarre
on
his
head
evidently
to
more
surely
command
the
respect
and
awe
of
the
multitude
i
had
requested
the
people
to
keep
silence
and
show
him
all
the
respect
and
courtesy
due
a
gentleman
who
was
visiting
them
for
the
first
time
as
soon
as
his
carriage
was
near
the
chapel
i
gave
a
signal
and
up
went
the
american
flag
to
the
top
of
a
mast
put
on
the
sacred
edifice
it
was
to
warn
the
ambassador
of
the
pope
that
he
was
not
treading
the
land
of
the
holy
inquisition
and
slavery
but
the
land
of
freedom
and
liberty
the
bishop
understood
it
for
raising
his
head
to
see
that
splendid
flag
of
stripes
and
stars
waving
to
the
breeze
he
became
pale
as
death
and
his
uneasiness
did
not
abate
when
the
thousands
around
him
rent
the
air
with
the
cry
hurrah
for
the
flag
of
the
free
and
the
brave
the
bishop
and
his
priests
thought
this
was
the
signal
i
had
given
to
slaughter
them
for
they
had
been
told
several
times
that
i
and
my
people
were
so
depraved
and
wicked
that
their
lives
were
in
great
danger
among
us
several
priests
who
had
not
much
relish
for
the
crown
of
martyrdom
jumped
from
their
carriages
and
ran
away
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
crowd
perceiving
the
marks
of
the
most
extreme
terror
on
the
face
of
the
bishop
i
ran
to
tell
him
that
there
was
not
the
least
danger
and
assured
him
of
the
pleasure
we
had
to
see
him
in
our
midst
i
offered
my
hand
to
help
him
down
from
his
carriage
but
he
refused
it
after
some
minutes
of
trembling
and
hesitation
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
the
ear
of
his
grand
vicar
mailloux
who
was
well
known
by
my
people
and
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
i
knew
that
it
was
by
his
advice
that
the
bishop
was
among
us
and
it
was
by
his
instigation
that
bishop
smith
had
refused
the
submission
we
had
given
him
rising
slowly
he
said
with
a
loud
voice
my
dear
french
canadian
countrymen
here
is
your
holy
bishop
kneel
down
and
he
will
give
you
his
but
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
poor
grand
vicar
this
so
well
laid
plan
for
beginning
the
battle
failed
entirely
not
a
single
one
of
that
immense
multitude
cared
for
the
benediction
nobody
knelt
thinking
that
he
had
not
spoken
loud
enough
he
raised
his
voice
to
the
highest
pitch
and
cried
my
dear
fellow
countrymen
this
is
your
holy
bishop
he
comes
to
visit
you
kneel
down
and
he
will
give
you
his
but
nobody
knelt
and
what
was
worse
a
voice
from
the
crowd
answered
do
you
not
know
sir
that
here
we
no
longer
bend
the
knee
before
any
man
it
is
only
before
god
we
the
whole
people
cried
amen
to
that
noble
answer
i
could
not
restrain
a
tear
of
joy
from
falling
down
my
cheeks
when
i
saw
how
this
first
effort
of
the
ambassador
of
the
pope
to
entrap
my
people
had
signally
failed
but
though
i
thanked
god
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
this
first
success
he
had
given
to
his
soldiers
i
knew
the
battle
was
far
from
being
over
i
implored
him
to
abide
with
us
to
be
our
wisdom
and
our
strength
to
the
end
i
looked
at
the
bishop
and
seeing
his
countenance
as
distressed
as
before
i
offered
him
my
hand
again
but
he
refused
it
the
second
time
with
supreme
disdain
however
he
accepted
the
invitation
i
gave
him
to
come
to
the
platform
when
half
way
up
the
stairs
he
turned
and
seeing
me
following
him
he
put
forth
his
hand
to
prevent
me
from
ascending
any
further
and
said
i
do
not
want
you
on
this
platform
go
down
and
let
my
priests
alone
accompany
i
answered
him
it
may
be
that
you
do
not
want
me
there
but
i
want
to
be
at
your
side
to
answer
you
remember
that
you
are
not
on
your
own
ground
here
but
on
mine
he
then
silently
and
slowly
walked
up
when
on
the
platform
i
offered
him
a
good
arm
chair
which
he
refused
and
sat
on
one
of
his
own
choice
with
his
priests
around
him
i
then
addressed
him
as
follows
my
lord
the
people
and
pastor
of
anne
are
exceedingly
pleased
to
see
you
in
their
midst
we
promise
to
listen
attentively
to
what
you
have
to
say
on
condition
that
we
have
the
privilege
of
answering
he
answered
angrily
i
do
not
want
you
to
say
a
word
then
stepping
to
the
front
he
began
his
address
in
french
with
a
trembling
voice
but
it
was
a
miserable
failure
from
beginning
to
end
in
vain
did
he
try
to
prove
that
out
of
the
church
of
rome
there
is
no
salvation
he
failed
still
more
miserably
to
prove
that
the
people
have
neither
the
right
to
read
the
scriptures
nor
the
intelligence
to
understand
them
he
said
such
ridiculous
things
on
that
point
that
the
people
went
into
fits
of
laughter
and
some
said
that
is
not
true
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
the
bible
says
the
very
but
i
stopped
them
by
reminding
them
of
the
promise
they
had
made
of
not
interrupting
him
a
little
before
closing
his
address
he
turned
to
me
and
said
you
are
a
wicked
rebel
priest
against
your
holy
church
go
from
here
into
a
monastery
to
do
penance
for
your
sins
you
say
that
you
have
never
been
excommunicated
in
a
legal
way
well
you
will
not
say
that
any
longer
for
i
excommunicate
you
now
before
this
whole
i
interrupted
him
and
said
you
forget
that
you
have
no
right
to
excommunicate
a
man
who
has
publicly
left
your
church
long
he
seemed
to
realize
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
in
uttering
such
a
sentence
and
stopped
speaking
for
a
moment
then
recalling
his
lost
courage
he
took
a
new
and
impressive
manner
of
speaking
he
told
the
people
how
their
friends
their
relatives
their
very
dear
mothers
and
fathers
in
canada
were
weeping
over
their
apostacy
he
spoke
for
a
time
with
great
earnestness
of
the
desolation
of
all
those
who
loved
them
at
the
news
of
their
defection
from
their
holy
mother
church
then
resuming
he
said
my
dear
friends
please
tell
me
what
will
be
your
guide
in
the
ways
of
god
after
you
have
left
the
holy
church
of
your
fathers
the
church
of
your
country
who
will
lead
you
in
the
ways
of
god
those
words
which
had
been
uttered
with
great
emphasis
and
earnestness
were
followed
by
a
most
complete
and
solemn
silence
was
that
silence
the
result
of
a
profound
impression
made
on
the
crowd
or
was
it
the
silence
which
always
precedes
the
storm
i
could
not
say
but
i
must
confess
that
though
i
had
not
lost
confidence
in
god
i
was
not
without
anxiety
though
silent
and
ardent
prayers
were
going
to
the
from
my
heart
i
felt
that
that
poor
heart
was
troubled
and
anxious
as
it
had
never
been
before
i
could
have
easily
answered
the
bishop
and
confounded
him
in
a
few
words
but
i
thought
that
it
was
much
better
to
let
the
answer
and
rebuke
come
from
the
people
the
bishop
hoping
that
the
long
and
strange
silence
was
a
proof
that
he
had
successfully
touched
the
sensitive
chords
of
the
hearts
and
that
he
was
to
win
the
day
exclaimed
a
second
time
with
still
more
power
and
earnestness
my
dear
french
canadian
friends
i
ask
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
your
saviour
and
mine
in
the
name
of
your
desolated
mothers
fathers
and
friends
who
are
weeping
along
the
banks
of
your
beautiful
lawrence
river
i
ask
it
in
the
name
of
your
beloved
canada
answer
me
now
that
you
refuse
to
obey
the
holy
church
of
rome
who
will
guide
you
in
the
ways
of
salvation
another
solemn
silence
followed
that
impassionate
and
earnest
appeal
but
this
silence
was
not
to
be
long
when
i
had
invited
the
people
to
come
and
hear
the
bishop
i
requested
them
to
bring
their
bibles
suddenly
we
heard
the
voice
of
an
old
farmer
who
raising
his
bible
over
his
head
with
his
two
hands
said
this
bible
is
all
we
want
to
guide
us
in
the
ways
of
god
we
do
not
want
anything
but
the
pure
word
of
god
to
teach
us
what
we
must
do
to
be
saved
as
for
you
sir
you
had
better
go
away
and
never
come
here
any
and
more
than
voices
said
amen
to
that
simple
and
yet
sublime
answer
the
whole
crowd
filled
the
air
with
cries
the
bible
the
holy
bible
the
holy
word
of
god
is
our
only
guide
in
the
ways
of
eternal
life
go
away
sir
and
never
come
again
these
words
time
and
again
repeated
by
the
thousands
of
people
who
surrounded
the
platform
fell
upon
the
poor
bishop
s
ears
as
formidable
claps
of
thunder
they
were
ringing
as
his
death
knell
in
his
ears
the
battle
was
over
and
he
had
lost
it
bathed
in
his
tears
suffocated
by
his
sobs
he
sat
or
to
speak
more
correctly
he
fell
into
the
arm
chair
and
i
feared
at
first
lest
he
should
faint
when
i
saw
that
he
was
recovering
and
strong
enough
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
i
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
platform
but
i
had
scarcely
said
two
words
when
i
felt
as
if
the
claws
of
a
tiger
were
on
my
shoulders
i
turned
and
found
that
it
was
the
clenched
fingers
of
the
bishop
who
was
shaking
me
while
he
was
saying
with
a
furious
voice
no
no
not
a
word
from
as
i
was
about
to
show
him
that
i
had
a
right
to
refute
what
he
had
said
my
eyes
fell
on
a
scene
which
baffles
all
description
those
only
who
have
seen
the
raging
waves
of
the
sea
suddenly
raised
by
the
hurricane
can
have
an
idea
of
it
the
people
had
seen
the
violent
hand
of
the
bishop
raised
against
me
they
had
heard
his
insolent
and
furious
words
forbidding
me
to
say
a
single
word
in
answer
and
a
universal
cry
of
indignation
was
heard
the
infamous
wretch
down
with
him
he
wants
to
enslave
us
again
he
denies
us
the
right
of
free
speech
he
refuses
to
hear
what
our
pastor
has
to
reply
down
with
him
at
the
same
time
a
rush
was
made
by
many
toward
the
platform
to
scale
it
and
others
were
at
work
to
tear
it
down
that
whole
multitude
absolutely
blinded
by
their
uncontrollable
rage
were
as
a
drunken
man
who
does
not
know
what
he
does
i
had
that
such
things
had
occurred
before
but
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
it
again
i
rushed
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
with
great
difficulty
repulsed
those
who
were
trying
to
lay
their
hands
on
the
bishop
in
vain
i
raised
my
voice
to
calm
them
and
make
them
realize
the
crime
they
wanted
to
commit
no
voice
could
be
heard
in
the
midst
of
such
terrible
confusion
it
was
very
providential
that
we
had
built
the
scaffold
with
strong
materials
so
that
it
could
resist
the
first
attempt
to
break
it
happily
we
had
in
our
midst
a
very
intelligent
young
man
called
bechard
who
was
held
in
great
esteem
and
respect
his
influence
i
venture
to
say
was
irresistible
over
the
people
i
called
him
to
the
platform
and
requested
him
in
the
name
of
god
to
appease
the
blind
fury
of
that
multitude
strange
to
say
his
presence
and
a
sign
from
his
hand
acted
like
magic
let
us
hear
what
bechard
has
to
say
whispered
every
one
to
his
neighbor
and
suddenly
the
most
profound
calm
succeeded
the
most
awful
noise
and
confusion
i
had
ever
witnessed
in
a
few
appropriate
and
eloquent
words
that
young
gentleman
showed
the
people
that
far
from
being
angry
they
ought
to
be
glad
at
the
exhibition
of
the
tyranny
and
cowardice
of
the
bishop
had
he
not
confessed
the
wickedness
of
his
address
when
he
refused
to
hear
the
answer
had
he
not
confessed
that
he
was
the
vilest
and
most
impudent
of
tyrants
when
he
had
come
into
their
very
midst
to
deny
them
the
sacred
right
of
speech
and
reply
had
he
not
proved
before
god
and
man
that
they
had
done
well
to
reject
forever
the
authority
of
the
bishop
of
rome
when
he
was
giving
them
such
an
unanswerable
proof
that
that
authority
meant
the
most
unbounded
tyranny
on
his
part
and
the
most
degraded
and
ignominious
moral
degradation
on
the
part
of
his
blind
seeing
that
they
were
anxious
to
hear
me
i
then
told
them
instead
of
being
angry
you
ought
to
bless
god
for
what
you
have
heard
and
seen
from
the
bishop
of
chicago
you
have
heard
and
you
are
witnesses
that
he
has
not
given
us
a
single
argument
to
show
that
we
were
wrong
when
we
give
up
the
words
of
the
pope
to
follow
the
words
of
christ
was
he
not
right
when
he
told
you
that
there
was
no
need
on
my
part
to
answer
him
do
you
not
agree
that
there
was
nothing
to
answer
nothing
to
refute
in
his
long
address
has
not
our
merciful
god
brought
that
bishop
into
your
midst
to
show
you
the
truthfulness
of
what
i
have
so
often
told
you
that
there
was
nothing
manly
nothing
honest
or
true
in
him
have
you
heard
from
his
lips
a
single
word
which
could
have
come
from
the
lips
of
christ
a
word
which
could
have
come
from
that
great
god
who
so
loved
the
world
that
he
sent
his
eternal
son
to
save
it
on
the
simple
condition
that
we
should
repent
love
and
trust
in
him
was
there
a
single
sentence
in
all
you
have
heard
which
would
remind
you
that
salvation
through
christ
was
a
gift
that
eternal
life
was
a
free
gift
offered
to
all
those
who
accepted
him
as
their
true
and
only
saviour
have
you
heard
anything
from
him
to
make
you
regret
that
you
are
no
longer
his
obedient
and
abject
slaves
no
no
they
replied
then
instead
of
being
angry
with
that
man
you
ought
to
thank
him
and
let
him
go
in
peace
i
added
yes
yes
replied
the
people
but
on
condition
that
he
shall
never
come
then
mons
bechard
stepped
to
the
front
raised
his
hat
and
cried
with
his
powerful
melodious
voice
people
of
anne
you
have
just
gained
the
most
glorious
victory
which
has
ever
been
won
by
a
people
against
their
tyrants
hurrah
for
anne
the
grave
of
the
tyranny
of
the
bishops
of
rome
in
america
that
whole
multitude
filled
with
joy
rent
the
air
with
the
cry
hurrah
for
anne
the
grave
of
the
tyranny
of
the
bishops
of
rome
in
america
i
then
turned
towards
the
poor
bishop
and
his
priests
whose
distress
and
fear
were
beyond
description
and
told
them
you
see
that
the
people
forgive
you
the
indignity
of
your
conduct
by
not
allowing
me
to
answer
you
but
i
counsel
you
not
to
repeat
that
insult
here
please
take
the
advice
they
gave
you
go
away
as
quickly
as
possible
i
will
go
with
you
to
your
carriage
through
the
crowd
and
i
pledge
myself
that
you
will
be
safe
provided
you
do
not
insult
them
opening
their
ranks
the
crowd
made
a
passage
through
which
i
led
the
bishop
and
his
long
suite
of
priests
to
their
carriages
this
was
done
in
a
most
profound
silence
only
a
few
women
whispering
to
the
prelate
as
he
was
hurrying
by
away
with
you
and
never
come
here
again
henceforward
we
follow
nothing
but
crushed
by
waves
of
humiliation
such
as
no
bishop
had
ever
met
with
on
this
continent
the
weight
of
the
ignominy
which
he
had
reaped
in
our
midst
completely
overpowered
his
mind
and
ruined
him
he
left
us
to
wander
every
day
nearer
the
regions
of
lunacy
that
bishop
whose
beginning
had
been
so
brilliant
after
his
shameful
defeat
at
anne
on
the
of
august
was
soon
to
end
his
broken
career
in
the
lunatic
asylum
at
louis
where
he
is
still
confined
chapter
lxvii
bird
view
of
the
principal
events
from
my
conversion
to
this
narrow
end
of
the
voyage
through
the
desert
to
the
promised
land
the
marvellous
power
of
the
gospel
to
raise
a
man
above
himself
and
give
him
a
supernatural
strength
and
wisdom
in
the
presence
of
the
most
formidable
difficulties
has
seldom
been
more
gloriously
manifested
than
on
the
of
august
on
the
hill
of
anne
illinois
surely
the
continent
of
america
has
never
seen
a
more
admirable
transformation
of
a
whole
people
than
was
then
and
there
accomplished
with
no
other
help
than
the
reading
of
the
gospel
that
people
had
suddenly
exchanged
the
chains
of
the
most
abject
slavery
for
the
royal
scepter
of
liberty
which
christ
offers
to
those
who
believe
in
him
by
the
strength
of
their
faith
they
had
pulverized
the
gigantic
power
of
rome
put
to
flight
the
haughty
representatives
of
the
pope
and
had
raised
the
banners
of
christian
liberty
on
the
very
spot
marked
by
the
bishop
as
the
future
citadel
of
the
empire
of
popery
in
the
united
states
such
work
was
so
much
above
my
capacity
so
much
above
the
calculation
of
my
intelligence
that
i
felt
that
i
was
more
its
witness
than
its
instrument
the
merciful
and
mighty
hand
of
god
was
too
visible
to
let
any
other
idea
creep
into
my
mind
and
the
only
sentiments
which
filled
my
soul
were
those
of
an
unspeakable
joy
and
of
gratitude
to
god
but
i
felt
that
the
greater
the
favors
bestowed
upon
us
from
heaven
the
greater
were
the
responsibilities
of
my
new
position
the
news
of
that
sudden
religious
reformation
spread
with
lightning
speed
all
over
the
continents
of
america
and
europe
and
an
incredible
number
of
inquiring
letters
reached
me
from
every
corner
episcopalians
methodists
congregationalists
baptists
and
presbyterians
of
every
rank
and
color
kindly
pressed
me
to
give
them
some
details
of
course
those
letters
were
often
accompanied
by
books
considered
the
most
apt
to
induce
me
to
join
their
particular
denominations
feeling
too
young
and
inexpert
in
the
ways
of
god
to
give
a
correct
appreciation
of
the
lord
s
doings
among
us
i
generally
answered
those
kind
enquirers
by
writing
them
please
come
and
see
with
your
own
eyes
the
marvellous
things
our
merciful
god
is
doing
in
the
midst
of
us
and
you
will
help
us
to
bless
in
less
than
six
months
more
than
one
hundred
venerable
ministers
of
christ
and
prominent
christian
laymen
of
different
denominations
visited
us
among
those
who
first
honored
us
with
their
presence
was
the
rt
rev
bishop
helmuth
of
london
canada
then
the
learned
dean
of
quebec
so
well
known
and
venerated
by
all
over
great
britain
and
canada
he
visited
us
twice
and
was
one
of
the
most
blessed
instruments
of
the
mercies
of
god
towards
us
i
am
happy
to
say
that
those
eminent
christians
without
any
exception
after
having
spent
from
one
to
twenty
days
in
studying
for
themselves
this
new
religious
movement
declared
that
it
was
the
most
remarkable
and
solid
evangelical
reformation
among
roman
catholics
they
had
ever
seen
the
christians
of
the
cities
of
chicago
baltimore
washington
philadelphia
new
york
boston
having
expressed
the
desire
to
hear
from
me
of
the
doings
of
the
lord
among
us
i
addressed
them
in
their
principal
churches
and
was
received
with
such
marks
of
kindness
and
interest
for
which
i
shall
never
be
able
sufficiently
to
thank
god
i
have
previously
said
that
we
had
at
first
adopted
the
beautiful
name
of
christian
catholics
but
we
soon
perceived
that
unless
we
joined
one
of
the
christian
denominations
of
the
day
we
were
in
danger
of
forming
a
new
sect
after
many
serious
and
prayerful
considerations
it
seemed
that
the
wisest
thing
we
could
do
was
to
connect
ourselves
with
that
branch
of
the
vine
which
was
the
nearest
if
not
identical
with
that
of
the
french
protestants
which
gave
so
many
martyrs
to
the
church
of
christ
accordingly
it
was
our
privilege
to
be
admitted
in
the
presbyterian
church
of
the
united
states
the
presbytery
of
chicago
had
the
courtesy
to
adjourn
their
meeting
from
that
city
to
our
humble
town
on
the
of
april
when
i
presented
them
with
the
names
of
nearly
converts
who
with
myself
were
received
into
full
communion
with
the
church
of
christ
this
solemn
action
was
soon
followed
by
the
establishment
of
missions
and
congregations
in
the
cities
and
towns
of
chicago
aurora
kankakee
middleport
watseka
momence
sterling
manteno
where
the
light
of
the
gospel
had
been
received
by
large
numbers
of
our
french
canadian
emigrants
whom
i
had
previously
visited
the
census
of
the
converts
taken
then
gave
us
about
precious
souls
already
wrenched
from
the
iron
grasp
of
popery
it
was
a
result
much
beyond
my
most
sanguine
hopes
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
express
the
joy
it
gave
me
but
my
joy
was
not
without
a
mixture
of
anxiety
it
was
impossible
for
me
if
left
alone
to
distribute
the
bread
of
life
to
such
multitudes
scattered
over
a
territory
of
several
hundred
miles
i
determined
with
the
help
of
god
to
raise
a
college
where
the
children
of
our
converts
would
be
prepared
to
preach
the
gospel
of
our
young
men
having
offered
themselves
i
added
at
once
to
my
other
labors
the
daily
task
of
teaching
them
the
preparatory
course
of
study
for
their
future
evangelical
work
that
year
had
been
chosen
by
scotland
to
celebrate
the
tercentenary
anniversary
of
her
reformation
the
committee
of
management
composed
of
guthrie
professor
cunningham
and
begg
invited
me
to
attend
their
general
meetings
in
edinburgh
on
the
of
august
it
was
my
privilege
to
be
presented
by
those
venerable
men
to
one
of
the
grandest
and
noblest
assemblies
which
the
church
of
christ
has
ever
seen
after
the
close
of
that
great
council
which
i
addressed
twice
i
was
invited
during
the
next
six
months
to
lecture
in
great
britain
france
and
switzerland
and
to
raise
the
funds
necessary
for
our
college
it
is
during
that
tour
that
i
had
the
privilege
of
addressing
at
etienne
the
synod
of
the
free
protestant
church
of
france
lately
established
through
the
indomitable
energy
and
ardent
piety
of
the
rev
felix
monod
those
six
months
efforts
were
crowned
with
the
most
complete
success
and
more
than
were
handed
me
for
our
college
by
the
disciples
of
christ
but
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
i
should
pass
through
the
purifying
fires
of
the
greatest
tribulations
on
my
return
from
europe
into
my
colony
in
the
beginning
of
i
found
everything
in
confusion
the
ambition
of
the
young
men
i
had
invited
to
preach
in
my
place
and
in
whom
i
had
so
imprudently
put
too
much
confidence
encouraged
by
the
very
man
i
had
chosen
for
my
representative
and
my
attorney
during
my
absence
came
very
near
ruining
that
evangelical
work
by
sowing
the
seeds
of
division
and
hatred
among
our
dear
converts
through
the
dishonest
and
false
reports
of
those
two
men
the
money
i
had
collected
and
left
in
england
in
the
hands
of
a
gentleman
who
was
bound
to
send
it
at
my
order
was
retained
nearly
two
years
and
lost
in
the
failure
of
the
gelpeck
new
york
bank
through
which
it
was
sent
the
only
way
we
found
to
save
ourselves
from
ruin
was
to
throw
ourselves
into
the
hands
of
our
christian
brothers
of
canada
a
committee
of
the
presbyterian
church
composed
of
rev
s
kemp
cavan
and
scott
was
sent
to
investigate
the
cause
of
our
trouble
and
they
soon
found
them
kemp
published
a
critical
resume
of
their
investigation
which
clearly
showed
where
the
trouble
lay
our
integrity
and
innocence
were
publicly
acknowledged
and
we
were
solemnly
and
officially
received
as
members
of
the
presbyterian
church
of
canada
on
the
of
june
we
may
properly
acknowledge
here
that
the
christian
devotedness
the
admirable
ability
and
zeal
of
the
late
kemp
in
performance
of
that
work
has
secured
to
him
our
eternal
gratitude
in
i
was
again
invited
to
great
britain
by
the
committee
appointed
to
prepare
the
congratulatory
address
of
the
english
people
to
the
emperor
of
germany
and
bismark
for
their
noble
resistance
to
the
encroachments
of
popery
i
addressed
the
meetings
held
for
that
purpose
in
exter
hall
under
the
presidency
of
lord
john
russell
on
the
of
january
the
next
day
several
gospel
ministers
pressed
me
to
publish
my
years
experience
of
auricular
confession
as
an
antidote
to
the
criminal
and
too
successful
efforts
of
pusey
who
wanted
to
restore
that
infamous
practice
among
the
protestants
of
england
after
much
hesitation
and
many
prayers
i
wrote
the
book
entitled
the
priest
the
woman
and
the
confessional
which
god
has
so
much
blessed
to
the
conversion
of
many
that
editions
have
already
been
published
it
has
been
translated
into
many
languages
i
spent
the
next
six
months
in
lecturing
on
romanism
in
the
principal
cities
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
on
my
return
pressed
by
the
canadian
church
to
leave
my
colony
of
illinois
for
a
time
at
least
to
preach
in
canada
i
went
to
montreal
where
in
the
short
space
of
four
years
we
had
the
unspeakable
joy
of
seeing
seven
thousand
french
canadian
roman
catholics
and
emigrants
from
france
publicly
renounce
the
errors
of
popery
to
follow
the
gospel
of
christ
in
exhausted
by
the
previous
years
of
incessant
labors
i
was
advised
by
my
physicians
to
breathe
the
bracing
air
of
the
pacific
ocean
i
crossed
the
rocky
mountains
and
spent
two
months
lecturing
in
san
francisco
portland
oregon
and
in
washington
territory
where
i
found
great
numbers
of
my
french
countrymen
many
of
whom
received
the
gospel
with
joy
under
the
auspices
and
protection
of
my
orange
brethren
i
crossed
the
pacific
and
went
to
the
antipodes
lecturing
two
years
in
australia
tasmania
and
new
zealand
it
would
require
a
large
volume
to
tell
the
great
mercies
of
god
towards
me
during
that
long
perilous
but
interesting
voyage
during
those
two
years
i
gave
public
lectures
and
came
back
to
my
colony
of
anne
with
such
perfectly
restored
health
that
i
could
say
with
the
psalmist
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
thy
youth
is
renewed
like
the
eagle
but
the
reader
has
the
right
to
know
something
of
the
dangers
through
which
it
has
pleased
god
to
make
me
pass
rome
is
the
same
as
she
was
when
she
burned
john
huss
and
wishart
and
when
she
caused
protestants
to
be
slaughtered
in
france
and
to
be
exterminated
in
piedmont
and
italy
on
the
of
december
i
forced
the
rt
rev
bishop
foley
of
chicago
to
swear
before
the
civil
court
at
kankakee
that
the
following
sentence
was
an
exact
translation
of
the
doctrine
of
the
church
of
rome
as
taught
in
all
the
roman
catholic
seminaries
colleges
and
universities
through
the
summa
theologica
of
thomas
aquinas
vol
though
heretics
must
not
be
tolerated
because
they
deserve
it
we
must
bear
with
them
till
by
a
second
admonition
they
may
be
brought
back
to
the
faith
of
the
church
but
those
who
after
a
second
admonition
remain
obstinate
to
their
errors
must
not
only
be
excommunicated
but
they
must
be
delivered
to
the
secular
power
to
be
it
is
on
account
of
this
law
of
the
church
of
rome
which
is
in
full
force
as
it
was
promulgated
for
the
first
time
that
not
less
than
thirty
public
attempts
have
been
made
to
kill
me
since
my
conversion
the
first
time
i
visited
quebec
in
the
spring
of
fifty
men
were
sent
by
the
bishop
of
quebec
baillargeon
to
force
me
to
swear
that
i
would
never
preach
the
bible
or
to
kill
me
in
case
of
my
refusal
at
o
clock
sticks
were
raised
above
my
head
a
dagger
stuck
in
my
breast
and
the
cries
of
the
furious
mob
were
ringing
in
my
ears
infamous
apostate
now
you
are
in
our
hands
you
are
a
dead
man
if
you
do
not
swear
that
you
will
never
preach
your
accursed
never
had
i
seen
such
furious
men
around
me
their
eyes
were
more
like
the
eyes
of
tigers
than
of
men
i
expected
every
moment
to
receive
the
deadly
blow
and
i
asked
my
saviour
to
come
and
receive
my
soul
but
the
murderers
with
more
horrible
imprecations
cried
again
infamous
renegade
swear
that
you
will
never
preach
any
more
your
accursed
bible
or
you
are
a
dead
man
i
raised
my
eyes
and
hands
towards
heaven
and
said
oh
my
god
hear
and
bless
the
last
words
of
thy
poor
servant
i
solemnly
swear
that
so
long
as
my
tongue
can
speak
i
will
preach
thy
word
as
i
find
it
in
the
holy
bible
then
opening
my
vest
and
presenting
my
naked
breast
i
said
now
strike
but
my
god
was
there
to
protect
me
they
did
not
strike
i
went
through
their
ranks
into
the
streets
where
i
found
a
carter
who
drove
me
to
hall
the
mayor
of
the
city
for
that
day
i
showed
him
my
bleeding
breast
and
said
i
just
escaped
almost
miraculously
from
the
hands
of
men
sworn
to
kill
me
if
i
preach
again
the
gospel
of
christ
i
am
however
determined
to
preach
again
at
noon
even
if
i
have
to
die
in
the
i
put
myself
under
the
protection
of
the
british
flag
soon
after
more
than
british
soldiers
were
around
me
with
fixed
bayonets
they
formed
themselves
into
two
lines
along
the
streets
through
which
the
mayor
took
me
in
his
own
sleigh
to
the
lecture
room
i
could
then
deliver
my
address
on
the
bible
to
at
least
people
who
were
crowded
inside
and
outside
the
walls
of
the
large
building
after
this
i
had
the
joy
of
distributing
between
five
and
six
hundred
bibles
to
that
multitude
who
received
them
as
thirsty
and
hungry
people
receive
fresh
water
and
pure
bread
after
many
days
of
starvation
i
have
been
stoned
times
the
principal
places
in
canada
where
i
was
struck
and
wounded
and
almost
miraculously
escaped
were
quebec
montreal
ottawa
charlotte
town
halifax
antigonish
etc
in
the
last
mentioned
on
the
of
july
the
pastor
the
rev
goodfellow
standing
by
me
when
going
out
of
his
church
was
also
struck
several
times
by
stones
which
missed
me
at
last
his
head
was
so
badly
cut
that
he
fell
on
the
ground
bathed
in
blood
i
took
him
up
in
my
arms
though
wounded
and
bleeding
myself
we
would
surely
have
been
slaughtered
there
had
not
a
noble
scotchman
named
cameron
opened
the
door
of
his
house
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
to
give
us
shelter
against
the
assassins
of
the
pope
the
mob
furious
that
we
had
escaped
broke
the
windows
and
beseiged
the
house
from
till
next
morning
many
times
they
threatened
to
set
fire
to
cameron
s
house
if
he
did
not
deliver
me
into
their
hands
to
be
hung
they
were
prevented
from
doing
so
only
from
fear
of
burning
the
whole
town
composed
in
part
of
their
own
dwellings
several
times
they
put
long
ladders
against
the
walls
with
the
hope
of
reaching
the
upper
rooms
where
they
could
find
and
kill
their
victim
all
this
was
done
under
the
very
eyes
of
five
or
six
priests
who
were
only
at
a
distance
of
a
few
rods
at
montreal
in
the
winter
of
one
evening
coming
out
of
cote
street
church
where
i
had
preached
accompanied
by
principal
macvicar
we
fell
into
a
kind
of
ambuscade
and
received
a
volley
of
stones
which
would
have
seriously
if
not
fatally
injured
the
doctor
had
he
not
been
protected
from
head
to
foot
by
a
thick
fur
cap
and
overcoat
worn
in
the
cold
days
of
winter
in
canada
after
a
lecture
given
at
paramenta
near
sydney
australia
i
was
again
attacked
with
stones
by
the
roman
catholics
one
struck
my
left
leg
with
such
force
that
i
thought
it
was
broken
and
was
lame
for
several
days
in
new
south
wales
australia
i
was
beaten
with
whips
and
sticks
which
left
marks
upon
my
shoulders
at
horsham
in
the
same
province
on
the
of
april
the
romanists
took
possession
of
the
church
where
i
was
speaking
rushed
toward
me
with
daggers
and
pistols
crying
kill
him
kill
him
in
the
tumult
i
providentially
escaped
through
a
secret
door
but
i
had
to
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
a
pretty
long
distance
in
a
ditch
filled
with
mud
not
to
be
seen
and
escape
death
when
i
reached
the
hospitable
house
of
cameron
the
windows
were
broken
with
stones
much
of
the
furniture
destroyed
and
it
was
a
wonder
i
escaped
with
my
life
at
ballarat
in
the
same
province
three
times
the
houses
where
i
lodged
were
attacked
and
broken
rev
inglis
one
of
the
most
eloquent
ministers
of
the
city
was
one
of
the
many
who
were
wounded
by
my
side
the
wife
of
the
rev
quick
came
also
nearly
being
killed
while
i
was
under
their
hospitable
roof
in
the
same
city
as
i
was
waiting
for
the
train
at
the
station
a
well
dressed
lady
came
as
near
as
possible
and
spat
in
my
face
i
was
blinded
and
my
face
covered
with
filth
she
immediately
fled
but
was
soon
brought
back
by
my
secretary
and
a
policeman
who
said
here
is
the
miserable
woman
who
has
just
insulted
you
what
shall
we
do
with
her
i
was
then
almost
done
cleaning
my
face
with
my
handkerchief
and
some
water
brought
by
some
sympathizing
friends
i
answered
let
her
go
home
in
peace
she
has
not
done
it
of
her
own
accord
she
was
sent
by
her
confessor
she
thinks
she
has
done
a
good
action
when
they
spat
in
our
saviour
s
face
he
did
not
punish
those
who
insulted
him
we
must
follow
his
and
she
was
set
at
liberty
to
the
great
regret
of
the
crowd
the
very
next
day
of
april
at
castlemain
i
was
again
fiercely
attacked
and
wounded
on
the
head
as
i
came
from
addressing
the
people
one
of
the
ministers
who
was
standing
by
me
was
seriously
wounded
and
lost
much
blood
at
greelong
i
had
again
a
very
narrow
escape
from
stones
thrown
at
me
in
the
streets
in
while
lecturing
in
melbourne
the
splendid
capital
of
victoria
australia
i
received
a
letter
from
tasmania
signed
by
twelve
ministers
of
the
gospel
saying
we
are
much
in
need
of
you
here
for
though
the
protestants
are
in
the
majority
they
leave
the
administration
of
the
country
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
roman
catholics
who
rule
us
with
an
iron
rod
the
governor
is
a
roman
catholic
etc
we
wish
to
have
you
among
us
though
we
do
not
dare
to
invite
you
to
come
for
we
know
that
your
life
will
be
in
danger
day
and
night
while
in
tasmania
the
roman
catholics
have
sworn
to
kill
you
and
we
have
too
many
reasons
to
fear
that
they
will
fulfill
their
promises
but
though
we
do
not
dare
ask
you
to
come
we
assure
you
that
there
is
a
great
work
for
you
here
and
that
we
will
stand
by
you
with
our
people
if
you
fall
you
will
not
fall
i
answered
are
we
not
soldiers
of
christ
and
must
we
not
be
ready
and
willing
to
die
for
him
as
he
died
for
us
i
will
on
the
of
june
as
i
was
delivering
my
first
lecture
in
hobart
town
the
roman
catholics
with
the
approbation
of
their
bishop
broke
the
door
of
the
hall
and
rushed
towards
me
crying
kill
him
kill
him
the
mob
was
only
a
few
feet
from
me
brandishing
their
daggers
and
pistols
when
the
protestants
threw
themselves
between
them
and
me
and
a
furious
fight
occurred
during
which
many
wounds
were
received
and
given
the
soldiers
of
the
pope
were
overpowered
but
the
governor
had
to
put
the
city
under
martial
law
for
four
days
and
call
the
whole
militia
to
save
my
life
from
the
assassins
drilled
by
the
priests
in
a
dark
night
as
i
was
leaving
the
steamer
to
take
the
train
on
the
ottawa
river
canada
twice
the
bullets
of
the
murderers
whistled
at
no
more
than
two
or
three
inches
from
my
ears
several
times
in
montreal
and
halifax
the
churches
where
i
was
preaching
were
attacked
and
the
windows
broken
by
the
mobs
sent
by
the
priests
and
several
of
my
friends
were
wounded
two
of
whom
i
believe
died
from
the
effects
of
their
wounds
whilst
defending
me
the
of
june
after
i
had
preached
in
quebec
on
the
text
what
would
i
do
to
have
eternal
life
a
mob
of
more
than
roman
catholics
led
by
two
priests
broke
the
windows
of
the
church
and
attacked
me
with
stones
with
the
evident
object
to
kill
me
more
than
one
hundred
stones
struck
me
and
i
would
surely
have
been
killed
there
had
i
not
had
providentially
two
heavy
overcoats
which
i
put
one
around
my
head
and
the
other
around
my
shoulders
notwithstanding
that
protection
i
was
so
much
bruised
and
wounded
from
head
to
feet
that
i
had
to
spend
the
three
following
weeks
on
a
bed
of
suffering
between
life
and
death
a
young
friend
zotique
lefebre
who
had
heroically
put
himself
between
my
assassin
and
me
escaped
only
after
receiving
six
bleeding
wounds
in
the
face
the
same
year
in
the
month
of
november
i
was
attacked
with
stones
and
struck
several
times
when
preaching
and
in
coming
out
from
the
church
in
the
city
of
montreal
numbers
of
policemen
and
other
friends
who
came
to
my
rescue
were
wounded
my
life
was
saved
only
by
an
organization
of
a
thousand
young
men
who
under
the
name
of
protestant
guard
wrenched
me
from
the
hands
of
the
murderers
when
the
bishops
and
priests
saw
that
it
was
so
difficult
to
put
me
out
of
the
way
with
stones
sticks
and
daggers
they
determined
to
destroy
my
character
by
calumnies
spread
every
where
and
sworn
before
civil
tribunals
as
gospel
truths
during
eighteen
years
they
kept
me
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriffs
a
prisoner
under
bail
as
a
criminal
times
my
name
has
been
called
before
the
civil
and
criminal
courts
of
kankakee
joliet
chicago
urbana
and
montreal
among
the
names
of
the
vilest
and
most
criminal
of
men
i
have
been
accused
by
grand
vicar
mailloux
of
having
killed
a
man
and
thrown
his
body
into
a
river
to
conceal
my
crime
i
have
been
accused
of
having
set
fire
to
the
church
of
bourbonnais
and
destroyed
it
not
less
than
false
witnesses
have
been
brought
by
the
priests
of
rome
to
support
this
last
accusation
but
thanks
be
to
god
at
every
time
from
the
very
lips
of
the
perjured
witnesses
we
got
the
proof
that
they
were
swearing
falsely
at
the
instigation
of
their
father
confessors
and
my
innocence
was
proved
by
the
very
men
who
had
been
paid
to
destroy
me
in
this
last
suit
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
as
a
christian
and
citizen
to
have
one
of
those
priests
punished
for
having
so
cruelly
and
publicly
trampled
under
his
feet
the
most
sacred
laws
of
society
and
religion
without
any
vengeance
on
my
part
god
knows
it
i
asked
the
protection
of
my
country
against
those
incessant
plots
father
brunet
found
guilty
of
having
invented
those
calumnies
and
supported
them
by
false
witnesses
was
condemned
to
pay
or
go
to
gaol
for
fourteen
years
he
preferred
the
last
punishment
having
the
promise
from
his
roman
catholic
friends
that
they
would
break
the
doors
of
the
prison
and
let
him
go
free
to
some
remote
place
he
was
incarcerated
at
kankakee
but
on
a
dark
and
stormy
night
six
months
later
he
was
rescued
and
fled
to
montreal
miles
there
he
made
the
roman
catholics
believe
that
the
blessed
virgin
mary
dressed
in
a
beautiful
white
robe
had
come
in
person
to
open
for
him
the
gates
of
the
prison
i
do
not
mention
these
facts
here
to
create
bad
feelings
against
the
poor
blind
slaves
of
the
pope
it
is
only
to
show
to
the
world
that
the
church
of
rome
of
is
absolutely
the
same
as
when
she
reddened
europe
with
the
blood
of
millions
of
martyrs
my
motive
in
speaking
of
those
murderous
attacks
is
to
induce
the
readers
to
help
me
to
bless
god
who
has
so
mercifully
saved
me
from
the
hands
of
the
enemy
more
than
any
living
man
i
can
say
with
the
old
prophet
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
with
paul
i
could
often
say
we
are
troubled
on
every
side
yet
not
distressed
we
are
perplexed
but
not
in
despair
persecuted
but
not
forsaken
cast
down
but
not
destroyed
always
bearing
about
in
the
body
the
dying
of
the
lord
jesus
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
manifest
in
our
those
constant
persecutions
far
from
hindering
the
onward
march
of
the
evangelical
movement
to
which
i
have
consecrated
my
life
seem
to
have
given
it
a
new
impulse
and
a
fresher
life
i
have
even
remarked
that
the
very
day
after
i
had
been
bruised
and
wounded
the
number
of
converts
had
invariably
increased
i
will
never
forget
the
day
after
the
terrible
night
when
more
than
a
thousand
roman
catholics
had
come
to
stone
me
and
on
which
i
had
received
a
severe
wound
more
than
one
hundred
of
my
countrymen
asked
me
to
enroll
their
names
under
the
banner
of
the
gospel
and
publicly
sent
their
recantation
of
the
errors
of
rome
to
the
bishop
the
gospel
of
christ
is
advancing
with
an
irresistible
power
among
the
french
canadians
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
oceans
we
find
numbers
of
converts
in
almost
every
town
and
city
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
rallied
around
the
banners
of
christ
they
form
a
large
army
of
fearless
soldiers
of
the
cross
among
those
converts
we
count
now
priests
and
more
than
fifty
young
zealous
ministers
born
in
the
church
of
rome
in
hundreds
of
places
the
church
of
rome
has
lost
her
past
prestige
and
the
priests
are
looked
upon
with
indifference
if
not
contempt
even
by
those
who
have
not
yet
accepted
the
light
a
very
remarkable
religious
movement
has
also
been
lately
inaugurated
among
the
irish
roman
catholics
under
the
leadership
of
rev
ds
o
connor
and
quinn
which
promises
to
keep
pace
with
if
not
exceed
the
progress
of
the
gospel
among
the
french
more
than
ever
we
hear
the
good
master
s
voice
lift
up
your
eyes
and
look
on
the
fields
for
they
are
white
already
to
oh
may
the
day
soon
come
when
all
my
countrymen
will
hear
the
voice
of
the
lamb
and
come
to
wash
their
robes
in
his
blood
will
i
see
the
blessed
hour
when
the
dark
night
in
which
rome
keeps
my
dear
canada
will
be
exchanged
for
the
bright
and
saving
light
of
the
gospel
at
all
events
i
can
not
but
bless
god
for
what
mine
eyes
have
seen
and
mine
ears
have
heard
of
his
mercy
towards
me
and
my
countrymen
from
my
infancy
he
has
taken
me
into
his
arms
and
led
me
most
mercifully
through
ways
i
did
not
know
from
the
darkest
regions
of
superstition
to
the
blessed
regions
of
light
truth
and
life
from
the
day
he
granted
me
to
read
his
divine
word
on
my
dear
mother
s
knees
to
the
hour
he
came
to
me
as
the
gift
of
god
he
has
not
let
a
single
day
pass
without
speaking
to
me
some
of
his
warning
and
saving
words
i
have
not
always
paid
sufficient
attention
to
his
sweet
voice
i
confess
it
to
my
shame
my
mind
was
so
filled
with
the
glittering
sophisms
of
rome
that
many
times
i
refused
to
yield
to
the
still
voice
which
was
almost
night
and
day
heard
in
my
soul
but
my
god
was
not
repelled
by
my
infidelities
as
the
reader
will
find
in
this
book
when
driven
away
in
the
morning
he
came
back
in
the
silent
hours
of
the
night
for
more
than
years
he
forced
me
to
see
as
a
priest
the
abominations
which
exist
inside
the
walls
of
the
modern
babylon
i
may
say
he
took
me
by
the
lock
of
mine
head
as
he
did
with
the
prophet
of
old
and
said
son
of
man
lift
up
thine
eyes
now
the
way
towards
the
north
and
behold
northward
at
the
gate
of
the
altar
this
image
of
jealousy
in
the
entry
he
said
furthermore
unto
me
son
of
man
seest
thou
what
they
do
even
the
great
abominations
that
the
house
of
israel
committeth
here
that
i
should
go
far
off
from
my
sanctuary
but
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
and
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
court
and
when
i
looked
behold
a
hole
in
the
wall
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
dig
now
in
the
wall
and
when
i
had
digged
in
the
wall
and
behold
the
wicked
abominations
that
they
do
here
so
i
went
and
saw
and
behold
every
form
of
creeping
things
and
abominable
beasts
and
all
the
idols
of
the
house
of
israel
portrayed
upon
the
walls
round
about
and
there
stood
before
them
seventy
men
of
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
israel
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
zaazaniah
the
son
of
shaphan
with
every
man
his
censer
in
his
hand
and
a
thick
cloud
of
incense
went
up
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
hast
thou
seen
what
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
israel
do
in
the
dark
every
man
in
the
chambers
of
his
imagery
for
they
say
the
lord
has
forsaken
the
earth
he
said
also
unto
me
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
than
they
do
then
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
gate
of
the
lord
and
behold
there
sat
women
weeping
for
tammuz
then
said
he
unto
me
hast
thou
seen
this
o
son
of
man
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
than
these
and
he
brought
me
into
the
inner
court
of
the
lord
s
house
and
behold
at
the
temple
of
the
lord
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
were
about
five
and
twenty
men
with
their
backs
towards
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
their
faces
toward
the
east
and
they
worshipped
the
sun
toward
the
east
then
he
said
unto
me
hast
thou
seen
this
o
son
of
man
is
it
a
light
thing
to
the
house
of
judah
that
they
commit
the
abominations
which
they
commit
here
for
they
have
filled
the
land
with
violence
and
have
returned
to
provoke
me
into
anger
and
lo
they
put
the
branch
to
their
nose
therefore
will
i
also
deal
in
fury
mine
eyes
shall
not
spare
neither
will
i
have
pity
and
they
cry
in
mine
ears
with
a
loud
voice
yet
will
i
not
hear
ezek
i
can
say
with
john
one
of
the
seven
angels
said
unto
me
i
will
show
unto
thee
the
judgment
of
the
great
whore
that
sitteth
upon
many
waters
with
whom
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
have
been
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
her
fornications
so
he
carried
me
away
into
the
wilderness
and
i
saw
a
woman
sit
upon
a
scarlet
colored
beast
full
of
names
of
blasphemy
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
the
woman
was
arrayed
in
purple
and
scarlet
color
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
having
a
golden
cup
in
her
hand
full
of
abominations
and
filthiness
of
her
fornication
and
upon
her
forhead
was
a
name
written
mystery
babylon
the
great
the
mother
of
the
harlots
and
abominations
of
the
and
i
saw
the
woman
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
saints
and
with
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
jesus
and
when
i
saw
her
i
wondered
with
great
rev
and
after
the
lord
had
shown
me
all
these
abominations
he
took
me
out
as
the
eagle
takes
his
young
ones
on
his
wings
he
brought
me
into
his
beautiful
and
beloved
zion
and
he
set
my
feet
on
the
rock
of
my
salvation
there
he
quenched
my
thirst
with
the
pure
waters
which
flow
from
the
fountains
of
eternal
life
and
he
gave
me
to
eat
the
true
bread
which
comes
from
heaven
oh
that
i
might
go
all
over
the
world
through
this
book
and
say
with
the
psalmist
come
all
ye
that
fear
god
and
i
will
declare
what
he
hath
done
for
my
let
all
the
children
of
god
who
will
read
this
book
lend
me
their
tongues
to
praise
the
lord
let
them
lend
me
their
hearts
to
love
him
for
alone
i
can
not
praise
him
i
can
not
love
him
as
he
deserves
when
i
look
upon
the
years
which
have
passed
over
me
my
heart
leaps
for
joy
for
i
find
myself
at
the
end
of
trials
i
have
nearly
crossed
the
desert
only
the
narrow
stream
of
jordan
is
between
me
and
the
new
jerusalem
i
already
hear
the
great
voice
out
of
heaven
saying
behold
the
tabernacle
of
god
is
with
men
and
he
will
dwell
with
them
and
they
shall
be
his
people
and
he
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former

passed
away

overcometh

inherit
all

the
unspeakable
gift

been
given
me

my
heart

richest
treasure

my
steps
with
an
unspeakable
joy
toward
the
land
of
promise

the
angel
s
voice
telling
me

the
master
calls
thee

few
days
