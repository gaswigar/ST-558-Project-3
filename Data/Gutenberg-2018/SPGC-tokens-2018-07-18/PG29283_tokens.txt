comes
the
dangerous
bonanza
of
a
derelict
manned
by
death
invisible
his
planet
was
the
smallest
in
the
solar
system
and
the
loneliest
thad
allen
was
thinking
as
he
straightened
wearily
in
the
huge
bulging
inflated
fabric
of
his
osprey
space
armor
walking
awkwardly
in
the
magnetic
boots
that
held
him
to
the
black
mass
of
meteoric
iron
he
mounted
a
projection
and
stood
motionless
staring
moodily
away
through
the
vision
panels
of
his
bulky
helmet
into
the
dark
mystery
of
the
void
his
welding
arc
dangled
at
his
belt
the
electrode
still
glowing
red
he
had
just
finished
securing
to
this
mass
of
iron
his
most
recent
find
a
meteorite
the
size
of
his
head
five
perilous
weeks
he
had
labored
to
collect
this
rugged
lump
of
metal
a
jagged
mass
some
ten
feet
in
diameter
composed
of
hundreds
of
fragments
that
he
had
captured
and
welded
together
his
luck
had
not
been
good
his
findings
had
been
small
the
analysis
had
revealed
that
the
content
of
the
precious
metals
was
disappointingly
minute
footnote
the
meteor
or
asteroid
belt
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and
jupiter
is
mined
by
such
adventurers
as
thad
allen
for
the
platinum
iridium
and
osmium
that
all
meteoric
irons
contain
in
small
quantities
the
meteor
swarms
are
supposed
by
some
astronomers
to
be
fragments
of
a
disrupted
planet
which
according
to
bode
law
should
occupy
this
space
on
the
other
side
of
this
tiny
sphere
of
treasure
his
millen
atomic
rocket
was
sputtering
spurts
of
hot
blue
flame
jetting
from
its
exhaust
a
simple
mechanism
bolted
to
the
first
sizable
fragment
he
had
captured
it
drove
the
iron
ball
through
space
like
a
ship
through
the
magnetic
soles
of
his
insulated
boots
thad
could
feel
the
vibration
of
the
iron
mass
beneath
the
rocket
regular
thrust
the
magazine
of
uranite
fuel
capsules
was
nearly
empty
now
he
reflected
he
would
soon
have
to
turn
back
toward
mars
turn
back
but
how
could
he
with
so
slender
a
reward
for
his
efforts
meteor
mining
is
expensive
there
was
his
bill
at
millen
and
helion
mars
for
uranite
and
supplies
and
the
unpaid
last
instalment
on
his
osprey
suit
how
could
he
outfit
himself
again
if
he
returned
with
no
more
metal
than
this
there
were
men
who
averaged
a
thousand
tons
of
iron
a
month
why
could
fortune
smile
on
him
he
knew
men
who
had
made
fabulous
strikes
who
had
captured
whole
planetoids
of
rich
metal
and
he
knew
weary
men
who
had
braved
the
perils
of
vacuum
and
absolute
cold
and
meteors
for
hard
years
who
still
hoped
but
sometime
fortune
had
to
smile
and
then
the
picture
came
to
him
a
tower
of
white
metal
among
the
low
red
hills
near
helion
a
slim
graceful
tower
of
argent
rising
in
a
fragrant
garden
of
flowering
martian
shrubs
purple
and
saffron
and
a
girl
waiting
at
the
silver
door
a
trim
slender
girl
in
white
with
blue
eyes
and
hair
richly
brown
thad
had
seen
the
white
tower
many
times
on
his
holiday
tramps
through
the
hills
about
helion
he
had
even
dared
to
ask
if
it
could
be
bought
to
find
that
its
price
was
an
amount
that
he
might
not
amass
in
many
years
at
his
perilous
profession
but
the
girl
in
white
was
yet
only
a
glorious
dream
illustration
gigantic
claws
seemed
to
reach
out
of
empty
air
the
strangeness
of
interplanetary
space
and
the
somber
mystery
of
it
pressed
upon
him
like
an
illimitable
and
deserted
ocean
the
sun
was
a
tiny
white
disk
on
his
right
hanging
between
rosy
coronal
wings
his
native
earth
a
bright
greenish
point
suspended
in
the
dark
gulf
below
it
mars
nearer
smaller
a
little
ocher
speck
above
the
shrunken
sun
above
him
below
him
in
all
directions
was
vastness
blackness
emptiness
ebon
infinity
sprinkled
with
far
cold
stars
thad
was
alone
utterly
alone
no
man
was
visible
in
all
the
supernal
vastness
of
space
and
no
work
of
man
save
the
few
tools
of
his
daring
trade
and
the
glittering
little
rocket
bolted
to
the
black
iron
behind
him
it
was
terrible
to
think
that
the
nearest
human
being
must
be
tens
of
millions
of
miles
away
on
his
first
trips
the
loneliness
had
been
terrible
unendurable
now
he
was
becoming
accustomed
to
it
at
least
he
no
longer
feared
that
he
was
going
mad
but
sometimes
thad
shook
himself
and
spoke
aloud
his
voice
ringing
hollow
in
his
huge
metal
helmet
brace
up
old
top
in
good
company
when
you
by
yourself
as
dad
used
to
say
be
back
in
helion
in
a
week
or
so
anyhow
look
up
dan
and
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd
again
at
comet
place
what
price
a
friendly
boxing
match
with
mason
or
an
evening
at
the
teleview
theater
fresh

instead
of
this
stale
synthetic
stuff
real
food
in
place
of
these
tasteless
concentrates
a
hot
bath
instead
of
greasing
yourself
too
dull
out
here
life
he
broke
off
set
his
jaw
no
use
thinking
about
such
things
only
made
it
worse
besides
how
did
he
know
that
a
whirring
meteor
was
going
to
flash
him
out
before
he
got
back
he
drew
his
right
arm
out
of
the
bulging
sleeve
of
the
suit
into
its
ample
interior
found
a
cigarette
in
an
inside
pocket
and
lighted
it
the
smoke
swirled
about
in
the
helmet
drawn
swiftly
into
the
air
filters
darn
clever
these
suits
he
murmured
food
smokes
water
generator
all
where
you
can
reach
them
and
darned
expensive
too
i
better
be
looking
for
pay
metal
he
clambered
to
a
better
position
stood
peering
out
into
space
searching
for
the
tiny
gleam
of
sunlight
on
a
meteoric
fragment
that
might
be
worth
capturing
for
its
content
of
precious
metals
for
an
hour
he
scanned
the
black
gulf
as
the
sputtering
rocket
continued
to
drive
him
forward
there
she
glows
he
cried
suddenly
and
grinned
before
him
was
a
tiny
glowing
fleck
that
moved
among
the
unchanging
stars
he
stared
at
it
intensely
breathing
faster
in
the
helmet
always
he
thrilled
to
see
such
a
moving
gleam
what
treasure
it
promised
at
first
sight
it
was
impossible
to
determine
size
or
distance
or
rate
of
motion
it
might
be
ten
thousand
tons
of
rich
metal
a
fortune
it
would
more
probably
prove
to
be
a
tiny
stony
mass
not
worth
capturing
it
might
even
be
large
and
valuable
but
moving
so
rapidly
that
he
could
not
overtake
it
with
the
power
of
the
diminutive
millen
rocket
he
studied
the
tiny
speck
intently
with
practised
eye
as
the
minutes
passed
an
untrained
eye
would
never
have
seen
it
at
all
among
the
flaming
hosts
of
stars
skilfully
he
judged
from
its
apparent
rate
of
motion
and
its
slow
increase
in
brilliance
its
size
and
distance
from
him
must
be
must
be
fair
size
he
spoke
aloud
at
length
a
hundred
tons
i
bet
my
helmet
but
scooting
along
pretty
fast
stretch
the
little
old
rocket
to
run
it
down
he
clambered
back
to
the
rocket
changed
the
angle
of
the
flaming
exhaust
to
drive
him
directly
across
the
path
of
the
object
ahead
filled
the
magazine
again
with
the
little
pellets
of
uranite
which
were
fed
automatically
into
the
combustion
chamber
and
increased
the
firing
rate
the
trailing
blue
flame
reached
farther
backward
from
the
incandescent
orifice
of
the
exhaust
the
vibration
of
the
metal
sphere
increased
thad
left
the
sputtering
rocket
and
went
back
where
he
could
see
the
object
before
him
it
was
nearer
now
rushing
obliquely
across
his
path
would
he
be
in
time
to
capture
it
as
it
passed
or
would
it
hurtle
by
ahead
of
him
and
vanish
in
the
limitless
darkness
of
space
before
his
feeble
rocket
could
check
the
momentum
of
his
ball
of
metal
he
peered
at
it
as
it
drew
closer
its
surface
seemed
oddly
bright
silvery
not
the
dull
black
of
meteoric
iron
and
it
was
larger
more
distant
than
he
had
thought
at
first
in
form
too
it
seemed
curiously
regular
ellipsoid
it
was
no
jagged
mass
of
metal
his
hopes
sank
rose
again
immediately
even
if
it
were
not
the
mass
of
rich
metal
for
which
he
had
prayed
it
might
be
something
as
valuable
and
more
interesting
he
returned
to
the
rocket
adjusted
the
angle
of
the
nozzle
again
and
advanced
the
firing
time
slightly
even
at
the
risk
of
a
ruinous
explosion
when
he
returned
to
where
he
could
see
the
hurtling
object
before
him
he
saw
that
it
was
a
ship
a
tapering
once
more
his
dreams
were
dashed
the
officers
of
interplanetary
liners
lose
no
love
upon
the
meteor
miners
claiming
that
their
collected
masses
of
metal
almost
helpless
always
underpowered
are
menaces
to
navigation
thad
could
expect
nothing
from
the
ship
save
a
heliographed
warning
to
keep
clear
but
how
came
a
here
in
the
perilous
swarms
of
the
meteor
belt
many
a
vessel
had
been
destroyed
by
collision
with
an
asteroid
in
the
days
before
charted
lanes
were
cleared
of
drifting
metal
the
lanes
more
frequently
used
between
earth
mars
venus
and
mercury
were
of
course
far
inside
the
orbits
of
the
asteroids
and
the
few
ships
running
to
jupiter
moons
avoided
them
by
crossing
millions
of
miles
above
their
plane
could
it
be
that
legendary
green
ship
said
once
to
have
mysteriously
appeared
sliced
up
and
drawn
within
her
hull
several
of
the
primitive
ships
of
that
day
and
then
disappeared
forever
after
in
the
remote
wastes
of
space
absurd
of
course
he
dismissed
the
idle
fancy
and
examined
the
ship
still
more
closely
then
he
saw
that
it
was
turning
end
over
end
very
slowly
that
meant
that
its
gyros
were
stopped
that
it
was
helpless
drifting
disabled
powerless
to
avoid
hurtling
meteoric
stones
had
it
blundered
unawares
into
the
belt
of
swarms
been
struck
before
the
danger
was
realized
was
it
a
derelict
with
all
dead
upon
it
either
the
ship
machinery
was
completely
wrecked
thad
knew
or
there
was
no
one
on
watch
for
the
controls
of
a
modern
are
so
simple
and
so
nearly
automatic
that
a
single
man
at
the
bridge
can
keep
a
vessel
upon
her
course
it
might
be
he
thought
that
a
meteorite
had
ripped
open
the
hull
allowing
the
air
to
escape
so
quickly
that
the
entire
crew
had
been
asphyxiated
before
any
repairs
could
be
made
but
that
seemed
unlikely
since
the
ship
must
have
been
divided
into
several
compartments
by
bulkheads
could
the
vessel
have
been
deserted
for
some
reason
the
crew
might
have
mutinied
and
left
her
in
the
she
might
have
been
robbed
by
pirates
and
set
adrift
but
with
the
space
lanes
policed
as
they
were
piracy
and
successful
mutiny
were
rare
thad
saw
that
the
flier
navigation
lights
were
out
he
found
the
heliograph
signal
mirror
at
his
side
sighted
it
upon
the
ship
and
worked
the
mirror
rapidly
he
waited
repeated
the
call
there
was
no
response
the
vessel
was
plainly
a
derelict
could
he
board
her
and
take
her
to
mars
by
law
it
was
his
duty
to
attempt
to
aid
any
helpless
ship
or
at
least
to
try
to
save
any
endangered
lives
upon
her
and
the
salvage
award
if
the
ship
should
be
deserted
and
he
could
bring
her
safe
to
port
would
be
half
her
value
no
mean
prize
that
half
the
value
of
ship
and
cargo
more
than
he
was
apt
to
earn
in
years
of
mining
the
with
new
anxiety
he
measured
the
relative
motion
of
the
gleaming
ship
it
was
going
to
pass
ahead
of
him
and
very
soon
no
more
time
for
speculation
it
was
still
uncertain
whether
it
would
come
near
enough
so
that
he
could
get
a
line
to
it
rapidly
he
unslung
from
his
belt
the
apparatus
he
used
to
capture
meteors
a
powerful
electromagnet
with
a
thin
strong
wire
fastened
to
it
to
be
hurled
from
a
he
set
the
drum
on
which
the
wire
was
wound
upon
the
metal
at
his
feet
fastened
it
with
its
magnetic
anchor
wondering
if
it
would
stand
the
terrific
strain
when
the
wire
tightened
raising
the
helix
to
his
shoulder
he
trained
it
upon
a
point
well
ahead
of
the
rushing
flier
and
stood
waiting
for
the
exact
moment
to
press
the
lever
the
slender
spindle
of
the
ship
was
only
a
mile
away
now
bright
in
the
sunlight
he
could
see
no
break
in
her
polished
hull
save
for
the
dark
rows
of
circular
ports
she
was
not
by
any
means
completely
wrecked
he
read
the
black
letters
of
her
name
the
name
of
her
home
port
below
was
in
smaller
letters
but
in
a
moment
he
made
them
out
san
francisco
the
ship
then
came
from
the
earth
from
the
very
city
where
thad
was
born
the
gleaming
hull
was
near
now
only
a
few
hundred
yards
away
passing
aiming
well
ahead
of
her
to
allow
for
her
motion
thad
pressed
the
key
that
hurled
the
magnet
from
the
helix
it
flung
away
from
him
the
wire
screaming
from
the
reel
behind
it
thad
mass
of
metal
swung
on
past
the
ship
as
he
returned
to
the
rocket
and
stopped
its
clattering
explosions
he
watched
the
tiny
black
speck
of
the
magnet
it
vanished
from
sight
in
the
darkness
of
space
appeared
again
against
the
white
burnished
hull
of
the
rocket
ship
for
a
painful
instant
he
thought
he
had
missed
then
he
saw
that
the
magnet
was
fast
to
the
side
of
the
flier
near
the
stern
the
line
tightened
soon
the
strain
would
come
upon
it
as
it
checked
the
momentum
of
the
mass
of
iron
he
set
the
friction
brake
thad
flung
himself
flat
grasped
the
wire
above
the
reel
even
if
the
mass
of
iron
tore
itself
free
he
could
hold
to
the
wire
and
himself
reach
the
ship
he
flung
past
the
deserted
vessel
behind
it
his
lump
of
iron
swung
like
a
pebble
in
a
sling
a
cloud
of
smoke
burst
from
the
burned
lining
of
the
friction
brake
in
the
reel
then
the
wire
was
all
out
there
was
a
sudden
jerk
and
the
sphere
of
metal
was
gone
snapped
off
into
space
thad
clung
desperately
to
the
wire
muscles
cracking
tortured
arms
almost
drawn
from
their
sockets
fear
flashed
over
his
mind
what
if
the
wire
broke
and
left
him
floating
helpless
in
space
it
held
though
to
his
relief
he
was
trailing
behind
the
ship
eagerly
he
seized
the
handle
of
the
reel
began
to
wind
up
the
mile
of
thin
wire
half
an
hour
later
thad
suited
figure
bumped
gently
against
the
shining
hull
of
the
rocket
he
got
to
his
feet
and
gazed
backward
into
the
starry
gulf
where
his
sphere
of
iron
had
long
since
vanished
somebody
is
going
to
find
himself
a
nice
chunk
of
metal
all
welded
together
and
equipped
for
rocket
navigation
he
murmured
as
for
me
well
i
simply
to
run
this
tub
to
mars
he
walked
over
the
smooth
refulgent
hull
held
to
it
by
magnetic
soles
nowhere
was
it
broken
though
he
found
scars
where
small
meteoric
particles
had
scratched
the
brilliant
polish
so
no
meteor
had
wrecked
the
ship
what
then
was
the
matter
soon
he
would
know
the
was
not
large
a
hundred
and
thirty
feet
long
thad
estimated
with
a
beam
of
feet
but
her
trim
lines
bespoke
design
recent
and
good
the
double
ring
of
black
projecting
rockets
at
the
stern
told
of
unusual
speed
a
pretty
piece
of
salvage
he
reflected
if
he
could
land
her
on
mars
half
the
value
of
such
a
ship
unharmed
and
safe
in
port
would
be
a
larger
sum
than
he
dared
put
in
figures
and
he
must
take
her
in
now
that
he
had
lost
his
own
rocket
he
found
the
six
of
them
slender
silvery
cylinders
lying
secure
in
their
niches
three
along
each
side
of
the
flier
none
was
missing
so
the
crew
had
not
willingly
deserted
the
ship
he
approached
the
main
at
the
center
of
the
hull
behind
the
projecting
dome
of
the
bridge
it
was
closed
a
glance
at
the
dials
told
him
there
was
full
air
pressure
within
it
it
had
then
last
been
used
to
enter
the
rocket
not
to
leave
it
thad
opened
the
exhaust
valve
let
the
air
hiss
from
the
chamber
of
the
lock
the
huge
door
swung
open
in
response
to
his
hand
upon
the
wheel
and
he
entered
the
cylindrical
chamber
in
a
moment
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
air
was
hissing
into
the
lock
again
he
started
to
open
the
of
his
helmet
longing
for
a
breath
of
air
that
did
not
smell
of
sweat
and
stale
tobacco
smoke
as
that
in
his
suit
always
did
despite
the
best
chemical
purifiers
then
he
hesitated
perhaps
some
deadly
gas
from
the
combustion
chambers
thad
opened
the
inner
valve
and
came
upon
the
upper
deck
of
the
vessel
a
floor
ran
the
full
length
of
the
ship
broken
with
hatches
and
companionways
that
gave
to
the
rocket
rooms
cargo
holds
and
quarters
for
crew
and
passengers
below
there
was
an
enclosed
ladder
that
led
to
bridge
and
navigating
room
in
the
dome
above
the
hull
formed
an
arched
roof
over
it
the
deck
was
deserted
lit
only
by
three
dim
blue
globes
hanging
from
the
curved
roof
all
seemed
in
order
the
equipment
hanging
on
the
walls
and
the
huge
metal
patches
and
welding
equipment
for
repairing
breaks
in
the
hull
everything
was
clean
bright
with
polish
or
new
paint
and
all
was
very
still
the
silence
held
a
vague
brooding
threat
that
frightened
thad
made
him
wish
for
a
moment
that
he
was
back
upon
his
rugged
ball
of
metal
but
he
banished
his
fear
and
strode
down
the
deck
midway
of
it
he
found
a
dark
stain
upon
the
clean
metal
the
black
of
blood
a
few
tattered
scraps
of
cloth
beside
it
no
more
than
bloody
rags
and
a
heavy
meat
cleaver
half
hidden
beneath
a
bit
of
darkened
fabric
mute
record
of
tragedy
thad
strove
to
read
it
had
a
man
fought
here
and
been
killed
it
must
have
been
a
struggle
of
peculiar
violence
to
judge
by
the
dark
spattered
stains
and
the
indescribable
condition
of
the
remnants
of
clothing
but
what
had
he
fought
another
man
or
some
thing
and
what
had
become
of
victor
and
vanquished
he
walked
on
down
the
deck
the
torturing
silence
was
broken
by
the
abrupt
patter
of
quick
little
footsteps
behind
him
he
turned
quickly
nervously
with
a
hand
going
instinctively
to
his
welding
arc
which
he
knew
would
make
a
fairly
effective
weapon
it
was
merely
a
dog
a
little
dog
yellow
nondescript
pathetically
delighted
with
a
sharp
eager
bark
it
leaped
up
at
thad
pawing
at
his
armor
and
licking
it
standing
on
its
hind
legs
and
reaching
toward
the
visor
of
his
helmet
it
was
very
thin
as
if
from
long
starvation
both
ears
were
ragged
and
bloody
and
there
was
a
long
unhealed
scratch
across
the
shoulder
somewhat
inflamed
but
not
a
serious
wound
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
alight
with
joy
but
thad
thought
he
saw
fear
in
them
and
even
through
the
stiff
fabric
of
the
osprey
suit
he
felt
that
the
dog
was
trembling
suddenly
with
a
low
whine
it
shrank
close
to
his
side
and
another
sound
reached
thad
ears
a
cry
weird
and
harrowing
beyond
telling
a
scream
so
thin
and
so
high
that
it
roughened
his
skin
so
keenly
shrill
that
it
tortured
his
nerves
a
sound
of
that
peculiar
frequency
that
is
more
agonizing
than
any
bodily
pain
when
silence
came
again
thad
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
wall
the
welding
arc
in
his
hand
his
face
was
cold
with
sweat
and
a
queer
chill
prickled
up
and
down
his
spine
the
yellow
dog
crouched
whimpering
against
his
legs
ominous
threatening
stillness
filled
the
ship
again
disturbed
only
by
the
whimpers
and
frightened
growls
of
the
dog
trying
to
calm
his
overwrought
nerves
thad
listened
strained
his
ears
he
could
hear
nothing
and
he
had
no
idea
from
which
direction
the
terrifying
sound
had
come
a
strange
cry
thad
knew
it
had
been
born
in
no
human
throat
nor
in
the
throat
of
any
animal
he
knew
it
had
carried
an
alien
note
that
overcame
him
with
instinctive
fear
and
horror
what
had
voiced
it
was
the
ship
haunted
by
some
dread
entity
for
many
minutes
thad
stood
upon
the
deck
waiting
tensely
grasping
the
welding
tool
but
the
scream
did
not
come
again
nor
any
other
sound
the
yellow
dog
seemed
half
to
forget
its
fear
it
leaped
up
at
his
face
again
with
another
short
little
bark
the
air
must
be
good
he
thought
if
the
dog
could
live
in
it
he
unscrewed
the
of
his
helmet
and
lifted
it
the
air
that
struck
his
face
was
cool
and
clean
he
breathed
deeply
gratefully
and
at
first
he
did
not
notice
the
strange
odor
upon
it
a
curious
unpleasant
scent
earthly
almost
fetid
unfamiliar
the
dog
kept
leaping
up
whining
hungry
boy
thad
whispered
he
fumbled
in
the
bulky
inside
pockets
of
his
suit
found
a
slab
of
concentrated
food
and
tossed
it
out
through
the
opened
panel
the
dog
sprang
upon
it
wolfed
it
eagerly
and
came
back
to
his
side
thad
set
at
once
about
exploring
the
ship
first
he
ascended
the
ladder
to
the
bridge
a
metal
dome
covered
it
studded
with
transparent
ports
charts
and
instruments
were
in
order
and
the
room
was
vacant
heavy
with
the
fatal
silence
of
the
ship
thad
had
no
expert
knowledge
of
the
flier
mechanism
but
he
had
studied
interplanetary
navigation
to
qualify
for
his
license
to
carry
masses
of
metal
under
rocket
power
through
the
space
lanes
and
into
planetary
atmospheres
he
was
sure
he
could
manage
the
ship
if
its
mechanism
were
in
good
order
though
he
was
uncertain
of
his
ability
to
make
any
considerable
repairs
to
his
relief
a
scrutiny
of
the
dials
revealed
nothing
wrong
he
started
the
gyro
motors
got
the
great
wheels
to
spinning
and
thus
stopped
the
slow
turning
of
the
flier
then
he
went
to
the
rocket
controls
warmed
three
of
the
tubes
and
set
them
to
firing
the
vessel
answered
readily
to
her
helm
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
the
red
fleck
of
mars
over
the
bow
yes
i
can
run
her
all
right
he
announced
to
the
dog
which
had
followed
him
up
the
steps
keeping
close
to
his
feet
do
worry
old
boy
we
be
eating
a
juicy
beefsteak
together
in
a
week
at
comet
place
in
helion
down
by
the
canal
not
much
style
but
the
eats
and
now
we
going
to
do
a
little
detective
work
and
find
out
what
made
that
disagreeable
noise
and
what
happened
to
all
your
better
find
out
before
it
happens
to
us
he
shut
off
the
rockets
and
climbed
down
from
the
bridge
again
when
thad
started
down
the
companionway
to
the
officers
quarters
in
the
central
one
of
the
five
main
compartments
of
the
ship
the
dog
kept
close
to
his
legs
growling
trembling
hackles
lifted
sensing
the
animal
terror
pitying
it
for
the
naked
fear
in
its
eyes
thad
wondered
what
dramas
of
horror
it
might
have
seen
the
cabins
of
the
navigator
calculator
chief
technician
and
first
officer
were
empty
and
forbidding
with
the
ominous
silence
of
the
ship
they
were
neatly
in
order
and
the
berths
had
been
made
since
they
were
used
but
there
was
a
large
bloodstain
black
and
circular
on
the
floor
of
the
calculator
room
the
captain
cabin
held
evidence
of
a
violent
struggle
the
door
had
been
broken
in
its
fragments
with
pieces
of
broken
furniture
books
covers
from
the
berth
and
three
service
pistols
were
scattered
about
in
indescribable
confusion
all
stained
with
blood
among
the
frightful
debris
thad
found
several
scraps
of
clothing
of
dissimilar
fabrics
the
guns
were
empty
attempting
to
reconstruct
the
action
of
the
tragedy
from
those
grim
clues
he
imagined
that
the
five
officers
aware
of
some
peril
had
gathered
here
fought
and
died
the
dog
refused
to
enter
the
room
it
stood
at
the
door
looking
anxiously
after
him
trembling
and
whimpering
pitifully
several
times
it
sniffed
the
air
and
drew
back
snarling
thad
thought
that
the
unpleasant
earthy
odor
he
had
noticed
upon
opening
the
of
his
helmet
was
stronger
here
after
a
few
minutes
of
searching
through
the
wildly
disordered
room
he
found
the
ship
log
or
its
remains
many
pages
had
been
torn
from
the
book
and
the
remainder
soaked
with
blood
formed
a
stiff
black
mass
only
one
legible
entry
did
he
find
that
on
a
page
torn
from
the
book
which
somehow
had
escaped
destruction
dated
five
months
before
it
gave
the
position
of
the
vessel
and
her
bearings
she
was
then
just
outside
jupiter
orbit
earthward
bound
and
concluded
with
a
remark
of
sinister
implications
another
man
gone
this
morning
simms
assistant
technician
a
fine
workman
swears
he
heard
something
moving
on
the
deck
cook
thinks
some
of
the
doctor
stuffed
monstrosities
have
come
to
life
ridiculous
of
course
but
what
is
one
to
think
pondering
the
significance
of
those
few
lines
thad
climbed
back
to
the
deck
was
the
ship
haunted
by
some
weird
death
that
had
seized
the
crew
man
by
man
mysteriously
that
was
the
obvious
implication
and
if
the
flier
had
been
still
outside
jupiter
orbit
when
those
words
were
written
it
must
have
been
weeks
before
the
end
a
lurking
invisible
death
the
scream
he
had
heard
he
descended
into
the
forecastle
and
came
upon
another
such
silent
record
of
frightful
carnage
as
he
had
found
in
the
captain
cabin
dried
blood
scraps
of
cloth
knives
and
other
weapons
a
fearful
question
was
beginning
to
obsess
him
what
had
become
of
the
bodies
of
those
who
must
have
died
in
these
conflicts
he
dared
not
think
the
answer
gripping
the
welding
arc
thad
approached
the
after
hatch
giving
to
the
cargo
hold
trepidation
almost
overpowered
him
but
he
was
determined
to
find
the
sinister
menace
of
the
ship
before
it
found
him
the
dog
whimpered
hung
back
and
finally
deserted
him
contributing
nothing
to
his
peace
of
mind
the
hold
proved
to
be
dark
an
indefinite
black
space
oppressive
with
the
terrible
silence
of
the
flier
the
air
within
it
bore
still
more
strongly
the
unpleasant
fetor
thad
hesitated
on
the
steps
the
hold
was
not
inviting
but
at
the
thought
that
he
must
sleep
unguarded
while
taking
the
flier
to
mars
his
resolution
returned
the
uncertainty
the
constant
fear
would
be
unendurable
he
climbed
on
down
feeling
for
the
light
button
he
found
it
as
his
feet
touched
the
floor
blue
light
flooded
the
hold
it
was
filled
with
monstrous
things
colossal
creatures
such
as
nothing
that
ever
lived
upon
the
earth
like
nothing
known
in
the
jungles
of
venus
or
the
deserts
of
mars
or
anything
that
has
been
found
upon
jupiter
moons
they
were
monsters
remotely
resembling
insects
or
crustaceans
but
as
large
as
horses
or
elephants
creatures
upreared
upon
strange
limbs
armed
with
hideously
fanged
jaws
cruel
talons
frightful
snouts
and
glittering
scales
red
and
yellow
and
green
they
leered
at
him
with
phosphorescent
eyes
yellow
and
purple
they
cast
grotesquely
gigantic
shadows
in
the
blue
light
a
cold
shock
of
horror
started
along
thad
spine
at
sight
of
those
incredible
nightmare
things
automatically
be
flung
up
the
welding
tool
flicking
over
the
lever
with
his
thumb
so
that
violet
electric
flame
played
about
the
electrode
then
he
saw
that
the
crowding
hideous
things
were
motionless
that
they
stood
upon
wooden
pedestals
that
many
of
them
were
supported
upon
metal
bars
they
were
dead
mounted
collected
specimens
of
some
alien
life
grinning
wanly
and
conscious
of
a
weakness
in
the
knees
he
muttered
they
sure
will
fill
the
museum
if
everybody
gets
the
kick
out
of
them
that
i
did
a
little
too
realistic
i
say
guess
these
are
the
monstrosities
mentioned
in
the
page
out
of
the
log
no
wonder
the
cook
was
afraid
of
them
some
of
then
do
look
hellishly
alive
he
started
across
the
hold
shrinking
involuntarily
from
the
armored
enormities
that
seemed
crouched
to
spring
at
him
motionless
eyes
staring
so
at
the
end
of
the
long
space
he
found
the
treasure
glittering
in
the
blue
light
it
looked
unreal
incredible
a
dazzling
dream
he
stopped
among
the
fearful
things
that
seemed
gathered
as
if
to
guard
it
and
stared
with
wide
eyes
through
the
opened
of
his
helmet
he
saw
neat
stacks
of
gold
ingots
new
freshly
smelted
bars
of
iridium
of
argent
platinum
of
osmium
many
of
them
thousands
of
pounds
thad
knew
he
trembled
at
thought
of
their
value
almost
beyond
calculation
then
he
saw
the
coffer
lying
beyond
the
piled
gleaming
ingots
a
huge
box
eight
feet
long
made
of
some
crystal
that
glittered
with
snowy
whiteness
filled
with
sparkling
iridescent
gleams
and
inlaid
with
strange
designs
apparently
in
vermilion
enamel
with
a
little
cry
he
ran
toward
the
chest
moving
awkwardly
in
the
loose
deflated
fabric
of
the
osprey
suit
beside
the
coffer
on
the
floor
of
the
hold
was
literally
a
mountain
of
flame
blazing
gems
heaped
as
if
they
had
been
carelessly
dumped
from
it
cut
diamonds
incredibly
gigantic
monster
emeralds
sapphires
rubies
and
strange
stones
that
thad
did
not
recognize
and
thad
gasped
with
horror
when
he
looked
at
the
designs
of
the
vermilion
inlay
in
the
white
gleaming
crystal
weird
forms
shapes
of
creatures
somewhat
like
gigantic
spiders
and
more
unlike
them
demoniac
things
wickedly
fanged
jaws
slavering
executed
with
masterly
skill
that
made
them
seem
living
menacing
secretly
gloating
thad
stared
at
them
for
long
minutes
fascinated
almost
hypnotically
three
times
he
approached
the
chest
to
lift
the
lid
and
find
what
it
held
and
three
times
the
unutterable
horror
of
those
crimson
images
thrust
him
back
shuddering
nothing
but
pictures
he
muttered
hoarsely
a
fourth
time
he
advanced
trembling
and
seized
the
lid
of
the
coffer
heavy
massive
it
was
fashioned
also
of
glistening
white
crystal
and
inlaid
in
crimson
with
weirdly
hideous
figures
great
hinges
of
white
platinum
held
it
on
the
farther
side
it
was
fastened
with
a
simple
heavy
hasp
of
the
precious
metal
hands
quivering
thad
snapped
back
the
hasp
lifted
the
lid
new
treasure
in
the
chest
would
not
have
surprised
him
he
was
prepared
to
meet
dazzling
wonders
of
gems
or
priceless
metal
nor
would
he
have
been
astonished
at
some
weird
creature
such
as
one
of
those
whose
likenesses
were
inlaid
in
the
crystal
but
what
he
saw
made
him
drop
the
massive
lid
a
woman
lay
in
the
chest
motionless
in
white
in
a
moment
he
raised
the
lid
again
examined
the
still
form
more
closely
the
woman
had
been
young
the
features
were
regular
good
to
look
upon
the
eyes
were
closed
the
white
face
appeared
very
peaceful
save
for
the
extreme
cadaverous
pallor
there
was
no
mark
of
death
with
a
fancy
that
the
body
might
be
miraculously
living
sleeping
thad
thrust
an
arm
out
through
the
opened
panel
of
his
suit
and
touched
a
slender
bare
white
arm
it
was
stiff
very
cold
the
still
pallid
face
was
framed
in
fine
brown
hair
the
fair
small
hands
were
crossed
upon
the
breast
over
the
simple
white
garment
a
queer
ache
came
into
his
heart
something
made
him
think
of
a
white
tower
in
the
red
hills
near
helion
and
a
girl
waiting
in
its
fragrant
garden
of
saffron
and
purple
a
girl
like
this
the
body
lay
upon
a
bed
of
blazing
jewels
it
appeared
thad
thought
as
if
the
pile
of
gems
upon
the
floor
had
been
hastily
scraped
from
the
coffer
to
make
room
for
the
quiet
form
he
wondered
how
long
it
had
lain
there
it
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
living
but
minutes
before
some
preservative
his
thought
was
broken
by
a
sound
that
rang
from
the
open
hatchway
on
the
deck
above
the
furious
barking
and
yelping
of
the
dog
abruptly
that
was
silent
and
in
its
place
came
the
uncanny
and
terrifying
scream
that
thad
had
heard
once
before
on
this
flier
of
mystery
a
shriek
so
keen
and
shrill
that
it
seemed
to
tear
out
his
nerves
by
their
roots
the
voice
of
the
haunter
of
the
ship
when
thad
came
back
upon
the
deck
the
dog
was
still
barking
nervously
he
saw
the
animal
forward
almost
at
the
bow
hackles
raised
tail
between
its
legs
it
was
slinking
backward
barking
sharply
as
if
to
call
for
aid
apparently
it
was
retreating
from
something
between
thad
and
itself
but
thad
searching
the
deck
could
see
no
source
of
alarm
nor
could
the
structures
upon
it
have
shut
any
large
object
from
his
view
it
all
right
thad
called
intending
to
reassure
the
frightened
animal
but
finding
his
voice
queerly
dry
coming
on
the
double
old
man
do
worry
the
dog
had
reached
the
end
of
the
deck
it
stopped
yelping
but
snarled
and
whined
as
if
in
terror
it
began
darting
back
and
forth
moving
exactly
as
if
something
were
slowly
closing
in
upon
it
trapping
it
in
the
corner
but
thad
could
see
nothing
then
it
made
a
wild
dash
back
toward
thad
darting
along
by
the
wall
as
if
trying
to
run
past
an
unseen
enemy
thad
thought
he
heard
quick
rasping
footsteps
then
that
were
not
those
of
the
dog
and
something
seemed
to
catch
the
dog
in
as
it
leaped
it
was
hurled
howling
to
the
deck
for
a
moment
it
struggled
furiously
as
if
an
invisible
claw
had
pinned
it
down
then
it
escaped
and
fled
whimpering
to
thad
side
he
saw
a
new
wound
across
its
hips
three
long
parallel
scratches
from
which
fresh
red
blood
was
trickling
regular
scraping
sounds
came
from
the
end
of
the
deck
where
no
moving
thing
was
to
be
seen
sounds
such
as
might
be
made
by
the
walking
of
feet
with
unsheathed
claws
something
was
coming
back
toward
thad
something
that
was
terror
seized
him
with
the
knowledge
he
had
nerved
himself
to
face
desperate
men
or
a
savage
animal
but
an
invisible
being
that
could
creep
upon
him
and
strike
unseen
it
was
incredible
yet
he
had
seen
the
dog
knocked
down
and
the
bleeding
wound
it
had
received
his
heart
paused
then
beat
very
quickly
for
the
moment
he
thought
only
blindly
of
escape
he
knew
only
an
overpowering
desire
to
hide
to
conceal
himself
from
the
invisible
thing
had
it
been
possible
he
might
have
tried
to
leave
the
flier
beside
him
was
one
of
the
companionways
amidships
giving
access
to
a
compartment
of
the
vessel
that
he
had
not
explored
he
turned
leaped
down
the
steps
with
the
terrified
dog
at
his
heels
below
he
found
himself
in
a
short
hall
dimly
lighted
several
metal
doors
opened
from
it
he
tried
one
at
random
it
gave
he
sprang
through
let
the
dog
follow
closed
and
locked
it
trying
to
listen
he
leaned
weakly
against
the
door
the
rushing
of
his
breath
swift
and
regular
the
loud
hammer
of
his
thudding
heart
the
dog
low
whines
then
unmistakable
scraping
sounds
outside
the
scratching
of
claws
thad
knew
invisible
claws
he
stood
there
bracing
the
door
with
the
weight
of
his
body
holding
the
welding
arc
ready
in
his
hand
several
times
the
hinges
creaked
and
he
felt
a
heavy
pressure
against
the
panels
but
at
last
the
scratching
sounds
ceased
he
relaxed
the
monster
had
withdrawn
at
least
for
a
time
when
he
had
time
to
think
the
invisibility
of
the
thing
was
not
so
incredible
the
mounted
creatures
he
had
seen
in
the
hold
were
evidence
that
the
flier
had
visited
some
unknown
planet
where
weird
life
reigned
it
was
not
beyond
reason
that
such
a
planet
should
be
inhabited
by
beings
invisible
to
human
sight
human
vision
as
he
knew
utilizes
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
spectrum
the
creature
must
be
largely
transparent
to
visible
light
as
human
flesh
is
radiolucent
to
hard
quite
possibly
it
could
be
seen
by
or
light
evidently
it
was
visible
enough
to
the
dog
eyes
with
their
different
range
of
sensitivity
pushing
the
subject
from
his
mind
he
turned
to
survey
the
room
into
which
he
had
burst
it
had
apparently
been
occupied
by
a
woman
a
frail
blue
silk
dress
and
more
intimate
items
of
feminine
wearing
apparel
were
hanging
above
the
berth
two
pairs
of
delicate
black
slippers
stood
neatly
below
it
across
from
him
was
a
dressing
table
with
a
large
mirror
above
it
combs
pins
jars
of
cosmetic
cluttered
it
and
thad
saw
upon
it
a
little
book
locked
stamped
on
the
back
diary
he
crossed
the
room
and
picked
up
the
little
book
which
smelled
faintly
of
jasmine
momentary
shame
overcame
him
at
thus
stealing
the
secrets
of
an
unknown
girl
necessity
however
left
him
no
choice
but
to
seize
any
chance
of
learning
more
of
this
ship
of
mystery
and
her
invisible
haunter
he
broke
the
flimsy
fastening
linda
cross
was
the
name
written
on
the
in
a
firm
clear
feminine
hand
on
the
next
page
was
the
photograph
in
color
of
a
girl
the
girl
whose
body
thad
had
discovered
in
the
crystal
coffer
in
the
hold
her
eyes
he
saw
had
been
blue
he
thought
she
looked
very
lovely
like
the
waiting
girl
in
his
old
dream
of
the
silver
tower
in
the
red
hills
by
helion
the
diary
it
appeared
had
not
been
kept
very
devotedly
most
of
the
pages
were
blank
one
of
the
first
entries
dated
a
year
and
a
half
before
told
of
a
party
that
linda
had
attended
in
san
francisco
and
of
her
refusal
to
dance
with
a
certain
man
referred
to
as
benny
because
he
had
been
unpleasantly
insistent
about
wanting
to
marry
her
it
ended
dad
said
that
we
going
off
in
the
again
all
the
way
to
uranus
if
the
new
fuel
works
as
he
expects
what
a
lark
to
explore
a
few
new
worlds
of
our
own
dad
says
one
of
uranus
moons
is
as
large
as
mercury
and
benny
wo
be
proposing
again
soon
turning
on
thad
found
other
scattered
entries
some
of
them
dealing
with
the
preparation
for
the
voyage
the
start
from
san
francisco
and
a
huge
bunch
of
flowers
from
benny
the
long
months
of
the
trip
through
space
out
past
the
orbit
of
mars
above
the
meteor
belt
across
jupiter
orbit
beyond
the
track
of
saturn
which
was
the
farthest
point
that
rocket
explorers
had
previously
reached
and
on
to
uranus
where
they
could
not
land
because
of
the
unstable
surface
the
remainder
of
the
entries
thad
found
less
frequent
shorter
bearing
the
mark
of
excitement
landing
upon
titania
the
third
and
largest
satellite
of
uranus
unearthly
forests
sheltering
strange
and
monstrous
life
the
hunting
of
weird
creatures
and
mounting
them
for
museum
specimens
then
the
discovery
of
a
ruined
city
whose
remains
indicated
that
it
had
been
built
by
a
lost
race
of
intelligent
spiderlike
things
the
finding
of
a
temple
whose
walls
were
of
precious
metals
containing
a
crystal
chest
filled
with
wondrous
gems
the
smelting
of
the
metal
into
convenient
ingots
and
the
transfer
of
the
treasure
to
the
hold
the
first
sinister
note
there
entered
the
diary
some
of
the
men
say
we
should
have
disturbed
the
temple
think
it
will
bring
us
bad
luck
rubbish
of
course
but
one
man
did
vanish
while
they
were
smelting
the
gold
poor
tom
james
i
suppose
he
ventured
away
from
the
rest
and
something
caught
him
the
few
entries
that
followed
were
shorter
and
showed
increasing
nervous
tension
they
recorded
the
departure
from
titania
made
almost
as
soon
as
the
treasure
was
loaded
the
last
was
made
several
weeks
later
a
dozen
men
had
vanished
from
the
crew
leaving
only
gouts
of
blood
to
hint
the
manner
of
their
going
the
last
entry
ran
dad
says
i
to
stay
in
here
old
dear
he
afraid
the
thing
will
get
me
whatever
it
is
it
really
serious
two
men
taken
from
their
berths
last
night
and
not
a
trace
some
of
them
think
it
a
curse
on
the
treasure
one
of
them
swears
he
saw
dad
stuffed
specimens
moving
about
in
the
hold
some
terrible
thing
must
have
slipped
aboard
the
flier
out
of
the
jungle
that
what
dad
and
the
captain
think
queer
they
ca
find
it
they
searched
all
over
well
musing
and
regretful
thad
turned
back
for
another
look
at
the
smiling
girl
in
the
photograph
what
a
tragedy
her
death
had
been
reading
the
diary
had
made
him
like
her
her
balance
and
humor
her
quiet
affection
for
dad
the
calm
courage
with
which
she
seemed
to
have
faced
the
creeping
lurking
death
that
darkened
the
ship
with
its
unescapable
shadow
how
had
her
body
come
to
be
in
the
coffer
he
wondered
when
all
the
others
were
gone
it
had
shown
no
marks
of
violence
she
must
have
died
of
fear
no
her
face
had
seemed
too
calm
and
peaceful
for
that
had
she
chosen
easy
death
by
some
poison
rather
than
that
other
dreadful
fate
had
her
body
been
put
in
the
chest
to
protect
it
and
the
poison
arrested
decomposition
thad
was
still
studying
the
picture
thoughtfully
and
sadly
when
the
dog
which
had
been
silent
suddenly
growled
again
and
retreated
from
the
door
toward
the
corner
of
the
room
the
invisible
monster
had
returned
thad
heard
its
claws
scratching
across
the
door
again
and
he
heard
another
dreadful
sound
not
the
long
shrill
scream
that
had
so
grated
on
his
nerves
before
but
a
short
sharp
coughing
or
barking
a
series
of
shrill
indescribable
notes
that
could
have
been
made
by
no
beast
he
knew
the
decision
to
open
the
door
cost
a
huge
effort
of
thad
will
for
hours
he
had
waited
thinking
desperately
and
the
thing
outside
the
door
had
waited
as
patiently
scratching
upon
it
from
time
to
time
uttering
those
dreadful
shrill
coughing
cries
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
face
the
monster
even
if
he
could
escape
from
the
room
and
avoid
it
for
a
time
he
would
have
to
meet
it
in
the
end
and
it
might
creep
upon
him
while
he
slept
to
be
sure
the
issue
of
the
combat
was
extremely
doubtful
the
monster
apparently
had
succeeded
in
killing
every
man
upon
the
flier
even
though
some
of
them
had
been
armed
it
must
be
large
and
very
ferocious
but
thad
was
not
without
hope
he
still
wore
his
the
heavy
fabric
made
of
metal
wires
impregnated
with
a
tough
elastic
composition
should
afford
considerable
protection
against
the
thing
the
welding
arc
intended
to
fuse
refractive
meteoric
iron
would
be
no
mean
weapon
at
close
quarters
and
the
quarters
would
be
close
if
only
he
could
find
some
way
to
make
the
thing
visible
paint
or
something
of
the
kind
would
stick
to
its
skin
his
eyes
searching
the
room
caught
the
jar
of
face
powder
on
the
dressing
table
dash
that
over
it
it
ought
to
stick
enough
to
make
the
outline
visible
so
at
last
holding
the
powder
ready
in
one
hand
he
waited
until
a
time
when
the
pressure
upon
the
door
had
just
relaxed
and
he
knew
the
monster
was
waiting
outside
swiftly
he
opened
the
door
thad
had
partially
overcome
the
instinctive
horror
that
the
unseen
being
had
first
aroused
in
him
but
it
returned
in
a
sickening
wave
when
he
heard
the
short
shrill
coughing
cries
hideously
eager
that
greeted
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
quick
rasping
of
naked
claws
upon
the
floor
from
nothingness
he
flung
the
powder
at
the
sound
a
form
of
weird
horror
materialized
before
him
still
half
invisible
half
outlined
with
the
white
film
of
adhering
powder
gigantic
and
hideous
claws
that
seemed
to
reach
out
of
empty
air
the
side
of
a
huge
scaly
body
a
yawning
dripping
jaw
for
a
moment
thad
could
see
great
hooked
fangs
in
that
jaw
then
they
vanished
as
if
an
unseen
tongue
had
licked
the
powder
from
them
dissolving
it
in
fluids
which
made
it
invisible
that
unearthly
shape
leaped
at
him
he
was
carried
backward
into
the
room
hurled
to
the
floor
claws
were
rasping
upon
the
tough
fabric
of
his
suit
his
arm
was
seized
crushingly
in
jaws
desperately
he
clung
to
the
welding
tool
the
heated
electrode
was
driven
toward
his
body
he
fought
to
keep
it
away
he
knew
that
it
would
burn
through
even
the
insulated
fabric
of
his
suit
a
claw
ripped
savagely
at
his
side
he
heard
the
sharp
rending
sound
as
the
tough
fabric
of
his
suit
was
torn
and
felt
a
thin
pencil
of
pain
drawn
along
his
body
where
a
claw
cut
his
skin
suddenly
the
suit
was
full
of
the
earthy
fetor
of
the
monster
body
nauseatingly
intense
thad
gasped
tried
to
hold
his
breath
and
thrust
upward
hard
with
the
incandescent
electrode
he
felt
warm
blood
trickling
from
the
wound
a
numbing
blow
struck
his
arm
the
welding
tool
was
carried
from
his
hand
flung
to
the
side
of
the
room
it
clattered
to
the
floor
and
then
a
heavy
weight
came
upon
his
chest
forcing
the
breath
from
his
lungs
the
monster
stood
upon
his
body
and
clawed
at
him
thad
squirmed
furiously
he
kicked
out
with
his
feet
encountering
a
great
hard
body
futilely
he
beat
and
thrust
with
his
arms
against
the
pillarlike
limb
his
body
was
being
mauled
bruised
beneath
the
thick
fabric
he
heard
it
tear
again
along
his
right
thigh
but
he
felt
no
pain
and
thought
the
claws
had
not
reached
the
skin
it
was
the
yellow
dog
that
gave
him
the
chance
to
recover
the
weapon
the
animal
had
been
running
back
and
forth
in
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
fairly
howling
in
excitement
and
terror
now
with
the
mad
courage
of
desperation
it
leaped
recklessly
at
the
monster
a
mighty
dimly
seen
claw
caught
it
hurled
it
back
across
the
room
it
lay
still
broken
whimpering
for
a
moment
the
thing
had
lifted
its
weight
from
thad
body
and
thad
slipped
quickly
from
beneath
it
flung
himself
across
the
room
snatched
up
the
welding
tool
in
an
instant
the
creature
was
upon
him
again
but
he
met
it
with
the
incandescent
electrode
he
was
crouched
in
a
corner
now
where
it
could
come
at
him
from
only
one
direction
its
claws
still
slashed
at
him
ferociously
but
he
was
able
to
cling
to
the
weapon
and
meet
each
onslaught
with
hot
metal
gradually
its
mad
attacks
weakened
then
one
of
his
blind
thrusting
blows
seemed
to
burn
into
a
vital
organ
a
terrible
choking
strangling
sound
came
from
the
air
and
he
heard
the
thrashing
struggles
of
wild
convulsions
at
last
all
was
quiet
he
prodded
the
thing
again
and
again
with
the
hot
electrode
and
it
did
not
move
it
was
dead
the
creature
body
was
so
heavy
that
thad
had
to
return
to
the
bridge
and
shut
off
the
current
in
the
gravity
plates
along
the
keel
before
he
could
move
it
he
dragged
it
to
the
lock
through
which
he
had
entered
the
flier
and
consigned
it
to
space
five
days
later
thad
brought
the
into
the
atmosphere
of
mars
a
puzzled
pilot
came
aboard
in
response
to
his
signals
and
docked
the
flier
safely
at
helion
thad
went
down
into
the
hold
again
with
the
astonished
port
authorities
who
had
come
aboard
to
inspect
the
vessel
again
he
passed
among
the
grotesque
and
outrageous
monsters
in
the
hold
leading
the
gasping
officers
while
they
marveled
at
the
treasure
he
lifted
the
weirdly
embellished
lid
of
the
coffer
of
white
crystal
and
looked
once
more
upon
the
still
form
of
the
girl
within
it
pity
stirred
him
an
ache
came
in
his
throat
linda
cross
so
quiet
and
cold
and
white
and
yet
so
lovely
how
terrible
her
last
days
of
life
must
have
been
with
doom
shadowing
the
vessel
and
the
men
vanishing
mysteriously
one
by
one
terrible
until
she
had
sought
the
security
of
death
strangely
thad
felt
no
great
elation
at
the
thought
that
half
the
incalculable
treasure
about
him
was
now
safely
his
own
as
the
award
of
salvage
if
only
the
girl
were
still
living
he
felt
a
poignantly
keen
desire
to
hear
her
voice
thad
found
the
note
when
they
started
to
lift
her
from
the
chest
a
hasty
scrawl
it
lay
beneath
her
head
among
glittering
gems
this
woman
is
not
dead
please
have
her
given
skilled
medical
attention
as
soon
as
possible
she
lies
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
induced
by
the
injection
of
fifty
minims
of
zeronel
she
is
my
daughter
linda
cross
and
my
sole
heir
i
entreat
the
finders
of
this
to
have
care
given
her
and
to
keep
in
trust
for
her
such
part
of
the
treasure
on
this
ship
as
may
remain
after
the
payment
of
salvage
or
other
claims
sometime
she
will
wake
perhaps
in
a
year
perhaps
in
a
hundred
the
purity
of
my
drugs
is
uncertain
and
the
injection
was
made
hastily
so
i
do
not
know
the
exact
time
that
must
elapse
if
this
is
found
it
will
be
because
the
lurking
thing
upon
the
ship
has
destroyed
me
and
all
my
men
please
do
not
fail
me
levington
cross
thad
bought
the
white
tower
of
his
dreams
slim
and
graceful
in
its
martian
garden
of
saffron
and
purple
among
the
low
ocher
hills
beside
helion
he
carried
the
sleeping
girl
through
the
silver
door
where
the
girl
of
his
dreams
had
waited
and
set
the
coffer
in
a
great
vaulted
chamber
many
times
each
day
he
came
into
the
room
where
she
lay
to
look
into
her
pallid
face
and
feel
her
cold
wrist
he
kept
a
nurse
in
attendance
and
had
a
physician
call
daily
a
long
martian
year
went
by
looking
in
his
mirror
one
day
thad
saw
little
wrinkles
about
his
eyes
he
realized
that
the
nervous
strain
and
anxiety
of
waiting
was
aging
him
and
it
might
be
a
hundred
years
he
remembered
before
linda
cross
came
from
beneath
the
drug
influence
he
wondered
if
he
should
grow
old
and
infirm
while
linda
lay
still
young
and
beautiful
and
unchanged
in
her
sleep
if
she
might
awake
after
long
years
and
see
in
him
only
a
feeble
old
man
and
he
knew
that
he
would
not
be
sorry
he
had
waited
even
if
he
should
die
before
she
revived
on
the
next
day
the
nurse
called
him
into
the
room
where
linda
lay
he
was
bending
over
her
when
she
opened
her
eyes
they
were
blue
glorious
a
long
time
she
looked
up
at
him
first
in
fearful
wonder
then
with
confidence
and
dawning
understanding
and
at
last
she
smiled
