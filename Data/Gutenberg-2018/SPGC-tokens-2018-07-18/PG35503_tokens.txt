at
mapleshade
sylvia
was
in
her
riding
dress
looking
a
picture
a
day
later
he
was
arrested
at
firehill
and
taken
to
bloomington
jail
i
came
down
to
the
parlor
where
babbitts
was
waiting
i
poor
sylvia
hesketh
even
now
after
this
long
time
i
can
t
think
of
it
without
a
shudder
without
a
comeback
of
the
horror
of
those
days
after
the
murder
you
remember
hesketh
mystery
and
mystery
it
surely
was
baffling
as
it
did
the
police
and
the
populace
of
the
whole
state
for
who
could
guess
why
a
girl
like
that
rich
beautiful
without
a
care
or
an
enemy
should
be
done
to
death
as
she
was
think
of
five
o
clock
sitting
with
her
mother
taking
tea
in
the
library
at
mapleshade
and
that
same
night
found
the
side
of
a
lonesome
country
road
a
hundred
and
eighteen
miles
away
it
s
the
story
of
this
that
i
m
going
to
tell
here
and
as
you
ll
get
a
good
deal
of
me
before
i
m
through
i
d
better
right
now
at
the
start
introduce
myself
i
m
molly
morganthau
day
operator
in
the
telephone
exchange
at
longwood
new
jersey
years
old
dark
slim
and
as
for
my
put
them
down
as
medium
and
let
it
go
at
that
my
name
s
morganthau
because
my
father
was
a
polish
piece
worker
on
my
two
front
names
mary
mckenna
are
after
my
mother
who
was
from
county
galway
ireland
i
was
raised
in
an
east
side
tenement
but
i
went
steady
to
the
grammar
school
and
through
the
high
and
i
m
not
throwing
bouquets
at
myself
when
i
say
i
made
a
good
record
that
s
how
i
come
to
be
nervy
enough
to
write
this
you
ll
see
for
yourself
only
just
keep
in
mind
that
i
m
more
at
home
in
front
of
a
switchboard
than
at
a
desk
i
ve
supported
myself
since
i
was
sixteen
my
father
dying
then
and
my
rest
her
blessed
memory
years
later
first
i
was
in
a
department
store
and
then
in
the
telephone
company
i
haven
t
a
relation
in
the
country
and
if
i
had
i
wouldn
t
have
asked
a
nickel
off
them
i
m
that
kind
independent
that
s
enough
about
me
now
for
you
to
rightly
get
what
i
m
going
to
tell
i
ll
have
to
begin
with
a
description
of
longwood
village
and
the
country
round
about
i
ve
made
a
sort
of
isn
t
drawn
to
scale
but
it
gives
the
general
effect
all
with
that
and
what
i
ll
describe
you
can
get
an
idea
of
the
lay
of
the
land
which
you
have
to
have
to
understand
things
longwood
s
in
new
jersey
a
real
picturesque
village
of
a
thousand
inhabitants
it
s
a
little
over
an
hour
from
new
york
by
the
main
line
and
here
and
there
round
it
are
country
places
mostly
fine
ones
owned
by
rich
people
there
are
some
farms
too
and
along
the
railway
and
the
turnpike
are
other
villages
my
exchange
is
the
central
office
for
a
good
radius
of
country
taking
in
azalea
miles
above
us
on
the
main
line
and
running
its
wires
out
in
a
big
circle
to
the
scattered
houses
and
the
crossroad
settlements
it
s
on
main
street
opposite
the
station
and
from
my
chair
at
the
switchboard
i
can
see
the
platform
and
the
trains
as
they
come
down
from
cherry
junction
or
up
from
new
york
it
s
sixty
miles
from
longwood
to
the
junction
where
you
get
the
branch
line
that
goes
off
to
the
north
stopping
at
other
stations
mostly
for
the
farm
people
and
where
when
you
get
to
hazelmere
you
can
connect
with
an
express
for
philadelphia
also
you
can
keep
right
on
from
the
junction
and
get
to
philadelphia
that
way
which
is
easier
having
no
changes
and
better
trains
when
i
was
first
transferred
from
new
s
over
two
years
thought
i
d
die
of
the
lonesomeness
of
it
at
night
looking
out
of
my
lived
over
galway
s
elite
millinery
parlors
on
lincoln
those
miles
and
miles
of
country
with
a
few
lights
dotted
here
and
there
i
felt
like
i
was
cast
on
a
desert
island
after
a
while
i
got
used
to
it
and
that
first
spring
when
the
woods
began
to
get
a
faint
greenish
look
and
i
d
wake
up
and
hear
birds
twittering
in
the
elms
along
the
on
i
m
getting
sidetracked
it
s
going
to
be
hard
at
first
to
keep
myself
out
but
just
be
patient
i
ll
do
it
better
as
i
go
along
the
county
turnpike
goes
through
longwood
and
then
sweeps
away
over
the
open
country
between
the
estates
and
the
farms
and
now
and
then
a
latourette
out
along
it
like
beads
on
a
string
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
off
it
reaches
bloomington
a
big
town
with
hotels
and
factories
and
a
jail
about
twenty
miles
before
it
gets
to
bloomington
it
crosses
the
branch
line
near
cresset
s
farm
there
s
a
little
sort
of
station
an
open
cresset
s
crossing
built
for
the
cresset
farm
people
who
own
a
good
deal
of
land
in
that
vicinity
not
far
from
cresset
s
crossing
about
a
half
mile
apart
the
riven
rock
road
from
the
junction
and
the
firehill
road
from
jack
reddy
s
estate
run
into
the
turnpike
this
is
the
place
i
guess
where
i
d
better
tell
about
jack
reddy
who
was
such
an
important
figure
in
the
hesketh
mystery
and
get
red
now
when
i
write
such
an
important
figure
to
me
a
good
ways
the
time
of
the
reddy
family
owned
most
of
the
country
round
here
bit
by
bit
they
sold
it
off
till
in
old
reddy
s
s
they
had
left
was
the
firehill
property
and
hochalaga
lake
a
big
body
of
water
back
in
the
hills
beyond
huntley
firehill
is
an
stone
house
built
by
reddy
s
grandfather
it
got
its
name
from
a
grove
of
maples
on
the
top
of
a
mound
that
in
the
autumn
used
to
turn
red
and
orange
and
look
like
the
hillock
was
in
a
blaze
the
name
they
say
came
from
the
indian
days
and
so
did
hochalaga
though
what
that
stands
for
i
don
t
know
the
reddys
had
had
lots
of
offers
for
the
lake
but
never
would
sell
it
they
had
a
sort
of
little
shack
there
and
before
jack
s
time
when
there
were
no
automobiles
used
to
make
horseback
excursions
to
hochalaga
and
stay
for
a
few
days
after
the
old
people
died
and
jack
came
into
the
property
everybody
thought
he
d
sell
the
parties
were
after
it
for
a
summer
he
refused
them
all
had
the
shack
built
over
into
an
bungalow
and
through
the
summer
would
have
guests
down
from
town
spending
out
there
now
i
m
telling
everything
truthful
for
that
s
what
i
set
out
to
do
and
if
you
think
i
m
a
fool
you
re
welcome
to
and
no
back
talk
from
i
was
crazy
about
jack
reddy
not
that
he
ever
gave
me
cause
he
s
not
that
kind
and
neither
am
i
and
let
me
say
right
here
that
there
s
not
a
soul
ever
knew
it
he
least
of
all
i
guess
no
one
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
the
owner
of
firehill
if
he
d
known
that
the
longwood
telephone
girl
most
had
heart
failure
every
time
he
passed
the
window
of
the
exchange
i
will
say
to
excuse
myself
that
there
s
few
girls
who
wouldn
t
have
put
their
hats
straight
and
walked
their
prettiest
when
they
saw
him
coming
was
a
good
looker
like
those
advertisements
for
collars
and
shirts
you
see
in
the
back
of
the
know
the
ones
but
it
wasn
t
that
that
got
me
it
was
his
ways
always
polite
never
fresh
if
he
d
meet
me
in
the
street
he
d
raise
his
hat
as
if
i
was
the
queen
of
sheba
and
there
wasn
t
any
hanging
round
my
switchboard
and
asking
me
to
make
dates
for
dinner
in
town
he
was
always
jolly
girl
in
a
telephone
exchange
gets
to
know
a
was
always
a
gentleman
he
lived
at
miles
from
two
old
servants
david
gilsey
and
his
wife
who
d
been
with
his
mother
and
just
doted
on
him
but
everybody
liked
him
there
wasn
t
but
one
criticism
i
ever
heard
passed
on
him
and
that
was
that
he
had
a
violent
temper
casey
his
chauffeur
told
a
story
in
the
village
of
how
one
day
when
they
were
passing
a
farm
they
saw
an
italian
laborer
prod
a
horse
with
a
pitchfork
before
he
knew
reddy
was
out
of
the
car
and
over
the
fence
and
mashing
the
life
out
of
that
dago
it
took
casey
and
the
farmer
to
pull
him
off
and
they
thought
the
dago
d
be
killed
before
they
could
there
was
talk
in
longwood
that
he
hadn
t
much
the
way
the
reddys
had
always
had
was
going
to
study
law
for
a
living
but
he
must
have
had
some
for
he
kept
up
the
house
and
had
two
motors
one
just
a
common
roadster
and
the
other
a
long
gray
racing
car
that
he
d
let
out
on
the
turnpike
till
he
was
twice
arrested
and
once
ran
over
a
dog
my
how
well
i
got
to
know
that
car
when
i
first
came
i
only
saw
it
at
long
intervals
as
if
luck
was
on
my
began
to
see
it
oftener
and
oftener
slowing
down
as
it
came
along
main
street
swinging
round
the
corner
jouncing
across
the
tracks
and
dropping
out
of
sight
behind
the
houses
at
the
head
of
maple
lane
what
s
bringing
jack
reddy
in
this
long
way
so
often
people
would
say
at
first
then
after
a
while
when
they
d
see
the
gray
car
they
d
look
sly
at
each
other
and
wink
there
s
one
good
thing
about
having
a
crush
on
a
party
that
s
never
thought
any
more
about
you
than
if
you
were
the
peg
he
hangs
his
hat
doesn
t
hurt
so
bad
when
he
falls
in
love
with
his
own
kind
of
girl
and
that
brings
if
i
was
in
the
gray
car
speeding
down
maple
mapleshade
and
the
fowlers
and
sylvia
hesketh
ii
about
a
mile
from
longwood
standing
among
ancient
beautiful
trees
is
mapleshade
dan
fowler
s
place
it
was
once
a
farmhouse
over
a
century
old
but
two
and
a
half
years
ago
when
fowler
bought
it
he
fixed
it
all
up
raised
the
roof
built
on
a
servants
wing
and
a
piazza
with
columns
and
turned
the
farm
buildings
into
a
garage
artists
and
such
people
say
it
s
the
prettiest
place
in
this
part
of
the
state
and
it
certainly
is
a
picture
especially
in
summer
with
the
lawns
mown
close
as
velvet
and
the
like
bits
of
carpet
laid
out
to
air
the
doctor
bought
a
big
bit
of
land
with
don
t
know
how
many
hundred
the
house
though
it
s
not
far
from
the
village
is
kind
of
secluded
and
shut
away
you
get
to
it
by
maple
lane
a
little
winding
road
that
runs
between
trees
caught
together
with
wild
grape
and
virginia
creeper
in
summer
they
re
like
green
walls
all
draped
over
with
the
vines
and
in
winter
they
turn
into
a
rustling
gray
hedge
woven
so
close
it
s
hard
to
see
through
about
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
gate
of
mapleshade
there
s
a
pine
that
was
struck
by
lightning
and
stands
up
black
and
bare
when
the
house
was
finished
the
doctor
who
was
a
bachelor
married
hesketh
a
widow
lady
accounted
rich
and
he
and
she
came
there
as
bride
and
groom
with
her
daughter
sylvia
hesketh
i
hadn
t
come
yet
but
from
what
i
ve
heard
there
was
gossip
about
them
from
the
start
what
i
can
say
from
my
own
experience
is
that
i
d
hardly
got
my
grip
unpacked
when
i
began
to
hear
of
the
folks
at
mapleshade
they
lived
in
great
style
with
a
housekeeper
a
butler
and
a
french
maid
for
the
ladies
in
the
garage
were
three
automobiles
fowler
s
limousine
the
doctor
s
car
and
a
dandy
little
roadster
that
belonged
to
miss
sylvia
neither
she
nor
the
doctor
bothered
much
with
the
chauffeur
they
left
him
to
take
fowler
round
and
drove
themselves
the
joke
going
that
if
miss
sylvia
ever
went
broke
she
could
qualify
for
a
chauffeur
s
job
after
a
while
the
story
came
out
that
it
wasn
t
fowler
who
was
so
rich
but
miss
hesketh
the
late
hesketh
had
only
left
his
wife
a
small
fortune
willing
the
it
was
his
daughter
she
was
a
the
trustees
of
the
estate
allowed
her
a
lot
of
money
for
her
maintenance
thirty
thousand
a
year
they
had
it
in
longwood
in
spite
of
the
grand
way
they
lived
there
wasn
t
much
company
at
mapleshade
anne
hennessey
the
housekeeper
told
me
fowler
was
so
dead
in
love
with
her
husband
she
didn
t
want
the
bother
of
entertaining
people
and
the
doctor
liked
a
quiet
life
he
d
been
a
celebrated
surgeon
in
new
york
but
had
retired
only
for
consultations
and
special
cases
now
and
again
he
was
very
good
to
the
people
round
about
and
would
come
in
and
help
when
our
little
pease
or
graham
at
the
junction
were
up
against
something
serious
i
ll
never
forget
when
mick
donahue
the
station
agent
s
boy
got
run
over
by
freight
no
but
i
m
sidetracked
again
anyhow
the
doctor
amputated
the
leg
and
little
mick
s
stumping
round
on
a
wooden
pin
almost
as
good
as
ever
but
even
so
they
weren
t
liked
much
they
held
their
heads
very
high
fowler
driving
through
the
village
like
it
was
fifth
avenue
sending
the
chauffeur
into
the
shops
and
not
at
all
affable
to
the
tradespeople
the
doctor
wouldn
t
trouble
to
give
you
so
much
as
a
nod
just
stride
along
looking
straight
ahead
when
the
story
got
about
that
he
d
lost
most
of
the
money
he
d
made
doctoring
i
didn
t
bear
any
resentment
seeing
it
was
worry
that
made
him
that
way
but
miss
sylvia
was
made
on
a
different
measure
my
but
she
was
a
winner
even
after
i
knew
what
brought
jack
reddy
in
from
firehill
so
often
i
couldn
t
be
set
against
her
jealous
i
might
be
of
a
girl
like
myself
but
not
of
one
who
was
the
queen
bee
of
the
hive
she
was
a
beauty
from
the
ground
blonde
with
hair
like
corn
silk
that
she
wore
in
a
loose
fluffy
knot
with
little
curly
ends
hanging
on
her
neck
her
face
was
pure
pink
and
white
the
only
dark
thing
in
it
her
big
brown
eyes
that
were
as
clear
and
soft
as
a
baby
s
and
she
was
a
great
dresser
always
the
latest
novelty
and
looking
prettier
in
each
one
galway
d
say
to
me
with
her
nose
caught
up
scornful
to
my
mind
it
s
not
refined
to
advertise
your
wealth
on
your
back
but
i
didn
t
worry
knowing
galway
d
have
advertised
hers
if
she
d
had
the
wealth
or
a
decent
shaped
back
to
advertise
it
on
which
she
hadn
t
being
there
was
none
of
the
haughty
ways
of
her
parents
about
miss
sylvia
when
she
d
come
into
the
exchange
to
send
a
call
a
thing
that
puzzled
me
first
but
i
soon
caught
on
she
d
always
stop
and
have
a
pleasant
word
with
me
on
bright
afternoons
i
d
see
her
pass
on
horseback
straight
as
an
arrow
with
a
man
s
hat
on
her
golden
hair
she
d
always
have
a
smile
for
everyone
touching
her
hat
brim
real
sporty
with
the
end
of
her
whip
even
when
she
was
in
her
motor
speeding
down
main
street
she
d
give
you
a
hail
as
jolly
as
if
she
was
your
college
chum
sometimes
she
d
be
alone
but
generally
there
was
a
man
along
there
were
a
lot
of
them
hanging
round
her
which
was
natural
seeing
she
had
everything
to
draw
them
like
a
candle
drawing
moths
they
d
come
and
go
from
town
and
now
and
then
stay
over
sunday
at
the
longwood
s
a
swell
little
place
done
up
in
the
colonial
you
d
see
them
riding
and
walking
with
her
very
devoted
at
first
everybody
thought
her
parents
were
agreeable
to
all
the
attention
she
was
getting
it
wasn
t
till
the
mapleshade
servants
began
to
talk
too
much
that
we
heard
the
fowlers
especially
the
doctor
didn
t
like
it
i
hadn
t
known
her
long
before
i
began
to
notice
something
that
interested
me
a
telephone
girl
sees
so
many
people
and
hears
such
a
lot
of
confidential
things
on
the
wire
that
she
gets
to
know
more
than
most
about
what
i
suppose
you
d
call
human
nature
it
s
a
study
that
s
always
attracted
me
and
in
miss
sylvia
s
case
there
was
a
double
was
curious
about
her
for
myself
and
i
was
curious
about
her
because
of
jack
reddy
what
i
noticed
was
that
she
was
so
different
with
men
to
what
she
was
with
to
both
but
it
was
another
kind
of
affability
i
ve
seen
considerably
many
girls
trying
to
throw
their
harpoons
into
men
and
doing
it
too
but
they
were
in
the
booby
class
beside
miss
sylvia
she
was
what
the
novelists
call
a
coquette
but
she
was
that
dainty
and
sly
about
it
that
i
don
t
believe
any
of
the
victims
knew
it
it
wasn
t
what
she
said
either
more
the
way
she
looked
and
the
soft
sweet
manner
she
had
as
if
she
thought
more
of
the
chap
she
was
talking
to
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
she
d
be
that
way
to
one
in
my
exchange
and
the
next
day
i
d
see
her
just
the
same
with
another
in
the
drugstore
it
made
me
uneasy
even
if
the
man
you
love
doesn
t
love
you
you
don
t
want
to
see
him
fooled
but
i
said
m
the
close
it
wasn
t
till
i
came
to
be
friends
with
anne
hennessey
that
i
heard
the
inside
facts
about
the
family
at
mapleshade
anne
hennessey
was
a
canadian
and
a
fine
girl
she
was
a
lady
and
had
a
lady
s
a
month
and
her
own
being
the
real
thing
she
didn
t
put
on
any
airs
but
when
she
liked
me
made
right
up
to
me
and
we
soon
were
pals
after
work
hours
i
d
sometimes
go
up
to
her
at
mapleshade
or
she
d
come
down
to
me
over
the
elite
i
remember
it
was
in
my
room
one
spring
lying
on
the
bed
and
anne
sitting
by
the
open
she
began
to
talk
about
the
fowlers
she
was
not
one
to
carry
tales
but
i
could
see
she
had
something
on
her
mind
and
for
the
first
time
she
loosened
up
i
was
picking
over
a
box
of
chocolates
and
i
didn
t
give
her
a
hint
how
keen
i
was
to
hear
acting
like
the
candies
had
the
best
part
of
my
attention
she
began
by
saying
the
doctor
and
miss
sylvia
didn
t
get
on
well
that
s
just
like
a
novel
i
answered
the
heroine
s
stepfather
s
always
her
natural
enemy
he
s
not
that
in
this
case
said
speaks
english
fine
like
the
teachers
in
the
i
m
sure
he
means
well
by
her
but
they
can
t
get
on
at
all
they
re
always
quarreling
there
s
many
a
gilded
home
hides
a
tragedy
what
do
they
fight
about
things
she
does
he
disapproves
of
she
s
very
spoiled
and
no
one
s
ever
controlled
her
and
she
resents
it
from
him
what
s
he
disapprove
of
anne
didn
t
answer
right
off
looking
thoughtful
out
of
the
window
then
she
said
slow
as
if
she
was
considering
her
words
i
m
going
to
tell
you
molly
because
i
know
you
re
no
gossip
and
can
be
trusted
and
the
truth
is
i
m
worried
i
don
t
like
the
situation
up
at
mapleshade
i
swung
my
feet
on
to
the
floor
and
sat
up
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
nibbling
at
a
chocolate
almond
here
s
where
i
get
dumb
i
said
sort
of
casual
to
encourage
her
sylvia
hesketh
s
a
girl
that
needs
a
strong
hand
over
her
and
there
s
no
one
has
it
her
father
s
dead
her
fowler
s
only
a
baby
ready
to
say
black
is
white
if
her
husband
wants
her
fowler
s
trying
to
do
it
and
he
s
going
about
it
all
wrong
you
see
she
said
turning
to
me
very
serious
it
s
not
only
that
she
s
and
extravagant
but
she
s
an
incorrigible
flirt
is
there
a
place
in
the
back
of
the
book
where
you
can
find
out
what
incorrigible
means
i
said
anne
smiled
but
not
as
if
she
felt
like
it
uncontrollable
irrepressible
her
fowler
s
ready
to
tell
me
anything
and
she
s
always
been
like
that
and
of
course
with
her
looks
and
her
fortune
the
men
are
around
her
like
flies
round
honey
why
does
the
doctor
mind
that
i
suppose
he
wouldn
t
mind
if
they
just
came
to
mapleshade
or
longwood
s
what
the
quarreling
s
s
found
out
that
she
meets
them
in
town
goes
to
lunch
and
the
matinée
with
them
excuse
me
but
i
ve
left
my
etiquette
book
on
the
piano
what
s
wrong
about
going
to
the
matinée
or
to
lunch
nothing
s
really
wrong
mind
you
molly
i
know
sylvia
through
and
through
and
there
s
no
harm
in
s
just
the
and
the
spoiling
and
the
admiration
but
of
course
in
her
position
a
girl
doesn
t
go
about
that
way
without
a
chaperone
the
doctor
s
perfectly
right
to
object
i
was
looking
down
pretending
to
hunt
over
the
box
who
does
she
go
with
i
said
oh
there
are
several
a
man
named
i
d
seen
him
often
a
swell
guy
in
white
spats
and
a
high
and
a
young
lawyer
called
dunham
and
ben
robinson
a
canadian
like
me
people
see
her
with
them
and
tell
the
doctor
and
there
s
a
row
i
looked
into
the
box
as
careful
as
if
i
was
searching
for
a
diamond
ain
t
reddy
one
of
the
happy
family
i
asked
ah
here
s
the
last
almond
oh
of
course
young
reddy
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
she
married
him
everybody
says
he
s
a
fine
fellow
and
i
tell
you
now
molly
with
sylvia
so
willful
and
the
doctor
so
domineering
and
fowler
being
pulled
to
pieces
between
them
things
at
mapleshade
can
t
go
on
long
the
way
they
are
that
was
in
may
at
the
end
of
june
the
fowlers
went
to
bar
harbor
with
all
their
outfit
for
the
summer
after
that
jack
reddy
didn
t
come
into
longwood
much
i
heard
that
he
was
spending
a
good
deal
of
his
time
at
the
bungalow
at
hochalaga
lake
and
i
did
see
him
a
few
times
meeting
his
company
at
the
had
some
parties
out
bringing
them
back
in
the
gray
car
at
the
end
of
september
the
fowlers
came
home
it
was
great
weather
clear
and
crisp
with
the
feel
of
frost
in
the
air
most
everybody
was
out
of
doors
and
i
saw
sylvia
often
sometimes
on
horseback
sometimes
driving
her
motor
she
was
prettier
than
ever
for
the
change
and
seemed
like
she
couldn
t
stay
in
the
house
i
d
see
her
riding
toward
home
in
the
red
light
of
the
sunset
and
as
i
walked
back
from
work
her
car
often
would
flash
past
me
speeding
through
the
early
dark
toward
maple
lane
anne
said
they
d
had
a
fairly
peaceful
summer
and
she
hoped
they
were
going
to
get
on
better
there
had
only
been
one
was
about
a
man
who
was
up
at
bar
harbor
and
had
met
sylvia
and
paid
her
a
good
deal
of
attention
the
doctor
had
been
very
angry
as
he
disapproved
of
the
was
his
name
cokesbury
i
cut
in
were
in
anne
s
room
that
why
he
belongs
round
here
anne
had
heard
that
and
wanted
to
know
what
i
knew
about
him
which
i
ll
write
down
in
this
place
as
it
seems
to
fit
in
and
has
to
be
told
somewhere
when
i
first
came
to
longwood
and
cokesbury
were
living
on
their
estate
cokesbury
lodge
about
miles
from
us
near
azalea
they
had
been
in
france
for
a
year
previous
to
that
then
come
back
and
taken
up
their
residence
in
cokesbury
s
country
seat
and
it
was
shortly
after
that
cokesbury
died
there
leaving
three
children
for
a
while
the
widower
stayed
on
with
nurses
and
governesses
to
look
after
the
poor
motherless
kids
then
the
eldest
boy
taking
sick
and
nearly
dying
he
decided
to
send
them
to
his
wife
s
parents
who
had
wanted
them
since
cokesbury
s
death
so
the
establishment
at
the
lodge
was
broken
up
and
cokesbury
went
to
live
in
town
there
were
rumors
that
the
house
was
to
be
sold
but
in
the
spring
sands
the
pullman
conductor
told
me
that
cokesbury
had
been
down
several
times
staying
over
sunday
and
had
said
he
had
given
up
the
idea
of
selling
the
place
he
told
sands
he
couldn
t
get
his
price
for
it
and
what
was
the
sense
of
selling
at
a
loss
especially
when
he
could
come
out
there
and
get
a
breath
of
country
air
when
he
was
scorched
up
with
the
city
heat
i
d
passed
the
house
one
day
in
august
when
i
was
on
an
auto
ride
with
some
friends
it
was
a
big
rambling
place
with
a
lot
of
pines
around
it
about
five
miles
from
azalea
and
with
no
near
neighbors
cokesbury
only
kept
one
d
had
several
when
his
wife
was
used
to
drive
himself
down
from
the
lodge
to
the
station
leave
his
car
in
the
azalea
garage
and
drive
himself
back
the
next
time
he
came
he
had
no
servants
or
caretaker
which
he
didn
t
need
as
after
cokesbury
s
death
all
the
valuable
things
had
been
taken
out
of
the
house
and
sent
to
town
for
storage
it
gave
me
a
jar
to
hear
that
sylvia
in
my
mind
was
as
good
as
engaged
to
jack
have
anything
to
do
with
him
i
d
never
seen
him
but
i
d
heard
a
lot
that
wasn
t
to
his
credit
he
hadn
t
been
good
to
his
said
she
was
a
real
was
the
gay
wild
kind
and
not
young
either
anne
said
he
was
forty
if
he
was
a
day
when
i
asked
her
what
sylvia
could
see
in
an
old
gink
like
that
she
just
shrugged
up
her
shoulders
and
said
who
could
was
made
that
way
she
was
like
some
woman
whose
name
i
can
t
remember
who
sat
on
a
rock
and
sang
to
the
sailors
till
they
got
crazy
and
jumped
into
the
water
my
head
was
full
of
these
things
one
glorious
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
october
being
my
started
out
for
a
walk
through
the
woods
the
woods
cover
the
hills
behind
the
village
and
they
re
grand
miles
and
miles
of
them
but
wait
there
was
a
little
thing
that
happened
by
the
way
that
s
worth
telling
for
it
gave
me
a
that
the
word
or
maybe
i
d
better
say
connected
up
with
what
was
in
my
mind
i
was
walking
slow
down
main
street
when
opposite
the
postoffice
i
saw
all
the
loafers
and
most
of
the
tradespeople
lined
up
in
a
ring
staring
at
a
bunch
of
those
dago
acrobats
that
go
about
the
state
all
summer
doing
stunts
on
a
bit
of
carpet
i
d
seen
them
in
dirty
pink
tights
walking
on
their
hands
and
rolling
round
in
i
wouldn
t
have
stopped
but
i
got
a
glimpse
of
little
mick
donahue
stumping
round
the
outside
trying
to
squeeze
in
and
trying
not
to
cry
because
he
couldn
t
so
i
stopped
and
hoisted
him
up
for
a
good
view
telling
the
men
in
front
to
break
a
way
for
the
kid
to
see
there
was
a
dago
scraping
on
a
fiddle
and
while
the
acrobats
were
performing
on
their
carpet
a
big
bear
with
a
little
brown
man
holding
it
by
a
chain
was
dancing
and
when
i
got
my
first
look
at
that
bear
in
spite
of
all
my
worry
i
burst
out
laughing
for
dancing
away
there
solemn
and
slow
it
was
the
dead
image
of
fowler
you
d
have
laughed
yourself
if
you
d
seen
is
if
you
d
known
the
doctor
there
was
something
so
like
him
in
its
of
gloomy
and
its
little
eyes
set
up
high
in
its
head
and
looking
angry
at
the
crowd
as
if
it
despised
them
when
its
master
jerked
the
chain
and
shouted
something
in
a
foreign
lingo
it
hitched
up
its
lip
like
it
was
trying
to
smile
and
that
sideways
grin
as
if
it
didn
t
feel
at
all
pleasant
was
just
the
way
the
doctor
d
smile
when
he
came
into
the
exchange
and
gave
me
a
number
it
fascinated
me
and
i
stood
staring
with
little
mick
sitting
on
my
arm
just
loving
it
all
his
dirty
little
fist
clasped
round
a
penny
then
the
music
stopped
and
one
of
the
acrobats
came
round
with
a
hat
and
little
mick
gave
a
great
sigh
as
if
he
was
coming
out
of
a
dream
if
you
hadn
t
come
molly
i
d
have
missed
it
he
said
looking
into
my
face
in
that
sweet
wistful
way
sickly
kids
have
and
it
s
the
last
time
they
ll
be
round
this
year
i
kissed
him
and
put
him
down
and
told
the
men
as
i
squeezed
out
to
keep
him
in
the
front
or
they
d
hear
from
me
then
i
walked
off
toward
the
woods
thinking
it
was
a
funny
idea
i
d
got
into
my
head
i
d
once
read
in
a
paper
that
when
people
looked
like
animals
they
resembled
the
animals
in
their
i
was
wondering
was
fowler
like
a
bear
grouchy
and
when
you
crossed
him
savage
maybe
it
was
because
i
d
been
so
worried
but
it
gave
me
a
kind
of
chill
my
thoughts
went
back
to
mapleshade
and
i
got
one
of
those
queer
glimpses
like
a
curtain
was
lifted
for
a
second
and
you
could
see
things
in
the
future
of
trouble
don
t
know
how
to
explain
it
but
it
was
as
if
i
got
a
new
line
on
the
doctor
as
if
the
bear
had
made
me
see
through
the
surface
clear
into
him
i
tried
to
shake
it
off
for
i
wanted
to
enjoy
my
afternoon
in
the
woods
they
are
beautiful
at
that
season
the
trees
full
of
colored
leaves
and
all
quiet
except
for
the
rustlings
of
little
animals
round
the
roots
there
s
a
road
that
winds
along
under
the
branches
and
trails
soft
under
foot
with
fallen
leaves
and
moss
that
you
can
follow
for
miles
i
was
coming
down
one
of
these
making
no
more
noise
than
the
squirrels
when
just
before
it
crossed
the
road
i
saw
something
and
stopped
there
sitting
side
by
side
on
a
log
were
sylvia
hesketh
and
a
man
close
to
them
run
off
to
the
side
was
a
motor
and
near
it
tied
to
a
tree
a
horse
with
a
lady
s
saddle
sylvia
was
in
her
riding
dress
looking
a
picture
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
slapping
softly
with
her
whip
on
the
side
of
her
boot
the
man
was
leaning
toward
her
talking
low
and
earnest
and
staring
hard
into
her
face
illustration
was
in
her
riding
dress
looking
a
to
my
knowledge
i
d
never
seen
him
before
and
it
gave
me
a
saying
surprised
to
myself
hullo
here
s
another
one
he
was
a
big
powerful
chap
with
a
square
healthy
looking
face
and
wide
shoulders
on
him
like
a
prize
fighter
he
was
dressed
in
a
loose
coat
and
knickerbockers
and
as
he
talked
he
had
his
hands
spread
out
one
on
each
knee
great
brown
hands
with
hair
on
them
i
was
close
enough
to
see
that
but
he
was
speaking
so
low
and
i
was
so
scared
that
they
d
see
me
and
think
i
was
spying
that
i
didn
t
hear
what
he
was
saying
the
only
one
that
saw
me
was
the
horse
it
looked
up
sudden
with
its
ears
pricked
staring
surprised
with
its
soft
gentle
eyes
i
stole
away
like
a
robber
not
making
a
speck
of
noise
all
the
joy
i
d
been
taking
in
the
walk
under
the
colored
leaves
was
gone
i
felt
kind
of
shriveled
up
way
you
feel
when
someone
you
love
is
sick
i
couldn
t
bear
to
think
that
jack
reddy
was
giving
his
heart
to
a
girl
who
d
meet
another
man
out
in
the
woods
and
listen
to
him
so
coy
and
yet
so
interested
as
far
as
i
can
remember
that
was
a
little
over
a
month
from
the
fatal
day
all
the
rest
of
october
and
through
the
first
part
of
november
things
went
along
quiet
and
peaceful
and
then
suddenly
everything
came
like
a
blow
iii
for
two
days
it
had
been
raining
heavy
straight
rain
from
my
window
at
galway
s
i
could
see
the
fields
round
the
village
full
of
pools
and
zigzags
of
water
as
if
they
d
been
covered
with
a
shiny
gray
veil
that
was
suddenly
pulled
off
and
had
caught
in
the
stubble
and
been
torn
to
rags
saturday
morning
the
weather
broke
but
the
sky
was
still
overcast
and
the
air
had
that
sort
of
warm
muggy
breathlessness
that
comes
after
rain
that
was
november
the
twentieth
it
was
eleven
o
clock
and
i
was
sitting
at
the
switchboard
looking
out
at
the
streets
all
puddles
and
ruts
when
i
got
a
call
from
the
dalzells
place
near
the
mapleshade
now
you
needn
t
get
preachy
and
tell
me
it
s
against
the
rules
to
and
maybe
discharge
i
know
that
better
than
most
didn
t
the
roof
over
my
head
and
the
food
in
my
mouth
depend
on
me
doing
my
work
according
to
orders
but
the
fact
is
that
at
this
time
i
was
keyed
up
so
high
i
d
got
past
being
cautious
when
a
call
came
for
mapleshade
i
listened
hard
with
all
my
ears
what
did
i
expect
to
hear
i
don
t
know
exactly
it
might
have
been
jack
reddy
and
it
might
have
been
never
mind
what
it
say
i
was
curious
and
let
it
go
at
that
so
i
lifted
up
the
cam
and
took
in
the
conversation
it
was
a
woman
s
dalzell
s
i
knew
it
fowler
s
hers
was
trembly
and
excited
oh
fowler
is
that
you
it
s
dalzell
yes
near
the
junction
my
husband
s
very
sick
we
ve
had
graham
and
he
says
it
s
appendicitis
and
there
ought
to
be
an
as
soon
as
possible
you
hear
me
then
fowler
very
calm
and
polite
perfectly
madam
oh
i
m
so
ve
been
so
worried
it
s
so
unexpected
dalzell
s
never
had
so
much
as
a
before
and
just
wait
a
minute
dalzell
came
the
doctor
let
me
understand
graham
recommends
an
operation
you
say
yes
fowler
as
soon
as
possible
something
awful
may
happen
if
it
s
not
done
and
graham
suggested
you
if
you
d
be
so
kind
i
know
it
s
a
favor
but
i
have
the
best
for
my
husband
you
come
please
to
oblige
me
fowler
asked
some
questions
which
i
needn
t
put
down
and
said
he
d
come
and
if
necessary
operate
then
they
talked
about
the
best
way
for
him
to
get
there
the
doctor
wanting
to
know
if
the
main
line
to
the
junction
wouldn
t
be
the
quickest
but
dalzell
said
she
d
been
consulting
the
time
tables
and
there
d
be
no
train
from
longwood
to
the
junction
before
two
and
if
he
wouldn
t
mind
and
would
come
in
his
auto
by
the
firehill
road
he
d
get
there
several
hours
sooner
he
agreed
to
that
and
it
wasn
t
fifteen
minutes
after
he
d
hung
up
that
i
saw
him
swing
past
my
window
in
his
car
driving
himself
later
on
in
the
afternoon
i
got
another
call
from
the
dalzells
for
mapleshade
and
heard
the
doctor
tell
fowler
that
the
operation
had
been
a
serious
one
and
that
he
would
stay
there
for
the
night
and
probably
all
the
next
day
before
that
second
call
about
two
hours
after
the
first
one
there
came
another
message
for
mapleshade
that
before
a
week
was
out
was
in
most
every
paper
in
the
country
and
that
lifted
me
right
into
the
middle
of
the
hesketh
mystery
it
was
near
one
o
clock
an
hour
when
work
s
slack
round
longwood
everybody
being
either
at
their
dinner
or
getting
ready
for
it
the
call
was
from
a
public
pay
station
and
was
in
a
man
s
voice
i
didn
t
know
but
that
because
of
my
curiosity
i
listened
to
as
sharp
as
if
it
was
my
lover
s
asking
me
to
marry
him
the
man
wanted
to
see
miss
sylvia
and
after
a
short
wait
i
heard
her
answer
very
gay
and
cordial
and
evidently
knowing
him
at
once
without
any
questions
if
she
d
said
one
word
to
show
who
he
was
things
afterward
would
have
been
very
different
but
there
wasn
t
a
single
phrase
that
you
could
identify
him
anyone
could
have
caught
was
that
they
seemed
to
know
each
other
very
well
he
began
by
telling
her
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
d
seen
her
and
wanting
to
know
if
she
d
come
to
town
on
monday
and
take
lunch
with
him
at
sherry
s
and
afterward
go
to
a
concert
monday
she
said
very
slow
and
soft
the
day
after
no
i
can
t
make
any
engagement
for
monday
why
not
he
asked
she
didn
t
answer
right
off
and
when
she
did
though
her
voice
was
so
sweet
there
was
something
sly
and
secret
about
it
i
ve
something
else
to
do
can
t
you
postpone
it
she
laughed
at
that
a
little
soft
laugh
that
came
bubbling
through
her
words
no
i
m
afraid
not
must
be
something
very
interesting
so
you
re
very
t
i
be
told
what
it
is
why
should
you
be
told
that
riled
him
i
could
hear
it
in
his
voice
as
a
friend
or
if
i
don
t
come
under
that
head
as
a
fellow
who
s
got
the
frosty
mit
and
wants
to
know
why
i
don
t
think
that
s
any
reason
i
have
no
engagement
with
you
and
i
have
else
just
tell
me
one
it
a
man
or
a
woman
she
began
to
laugh
again
and
if
i
d
been
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
that
laugh
would
have
made
me
wild
which
do
you
think
she
asked
i
don
t
think
i
and
knew
that
he
was
mad
well
if
you
know
she
said
as
sweet
as
pie
i
needn
t
tell
you
any
more
i
ll
say
no
he
shouted
don
t
hang
what
do
you
want
to
torment
me
for
then
he
got
sort
of
coaxing
it
isn
t
kind
to
treat
a
fellow
this
way
can
t
you
tell
me
who
it
is
no
that
s
a
secret
you
can
t
know
a
thing
till
i
choose
to
tell
you
and
i
don
t
choose
now
if
i
come
over
sunday
afternoon
will
you
see
me
what
time
any
time
you
m
your
humble
slave
as
you
know
i
m
going
out
about
seven
where
that
s
another
secret
i
think
a
child
listening
to
that
conversation
would
have
seen
he
was
getting
madder
every
minute
and
yet
he
was
so
afraid
she
d
cut
him
off
that
he
had
to
keep
it
under
and
talk
pleasant
look
here
he
said
i
ve
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
awfully
if
i
run
over
in
my
car
and
get
there
round
can
you
see
me
for
a
few
minutes
she
didn
t
answer
at
once
then
she
said
slow
as
if
she
was
undecided
not
at
the
house
i
didn
t
mean
at
the
house
say
in
maple
lane
by
the
gate
i
won
t
keep
you
more
than
five
or
ten
minutes
s
rather
late
well
any
time
you
say
can
t
you
be
there
exactly
at
if
that
s
a
condition
it
is
if
you
re
late
you
won
t
find
me
i
ll
be
gone
began
to
laugh
taking
my
secret
with
me
i
ll
be
there
on
the
dot
very
well
then
you
can
the
gate
just
as
the
clock
marks
one
quarter
after
six
and
maybe
if
you
re
good
i
ll
tell
you
the
secret
until
not
to
be
too
curious
it
s
a
bad
habit
and
i
ve
seen
signs
of
it
in
you
lately
before
he
could
say
another
word
she
d
disconnected
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
thinking
it
over
what
was
she
up
to
what
was
the
secret
and
who
was
the
man
run
over
in
his
car
looked
like
someone
from
one
of
the
big
estates
how
many
of
them
she
buzzing
round
her
and
then
for
all
i
was
so
downhearted
i
couldn
t
help
smiling
to
think
of
those
two
supposing
they
were
talking
so
secluded
and
an
east
side
tenement
girl
taking
it
all
in
little
did
i
guess
then
that
me
breaking
the
rules
that
way
instead
of
destroying
me
was
going
that
doesn
t
come
in
here
and
now
i
come
to
sunday
the
a
date
i
ll
never
forget
it
seemed
to
me
afterward
that
nature
knew
of
the
tragedy
and
prepared
for
it
the
weather
was
duller
and
grayer
than
it
had
been
on
saturday
not
a
breath
of
air
stirring
and
the
sky
all
mottled
over
with
clouds
dark
and
heavy
looking
a
full
moon
was
due
and
as
i
went
to
the
exchange
i
thought
of
the
sweethearts
that
had
dates
to
walk
out
in
the
moonlight
and
how
disappointed
they
d
be
things
weren
t
cheerful
at
the
exchange
either
i
found
minnie
trail
the
night
operator
as
white
as
a
ghost
saying
she
felt
as
if
one
of
her
sick
headaches
was
coming
on
and
if
it
did
would
i
stay
on
over
time
i
knew
those
ran
along
sometimes
till
eight
or
nine
i
told
her
to
go
right
home
to
bed
and
i
d
hold
the
fort
till
she
was
able
to
relieve
me
we
often
did
turns
like
that
one
for
the
other
it
s
one
of
the
advantages
of
being
in
a
small
country
one
picks
on
you
for
acting
human
about
ten
i
had
a
call
from
anne
hennessey
have
you
got
anything
on
for
this
evening
molly
i
have
not
this
is
longwood
not
gay
paree
then
i
ll
come
round
to
galways
about
seven
and
we
ll
go
to
the
gilt
edge
for
supper
i
want
to
talk
to
you
the
gilt
edge
lunch
was
where
i
took
my
meals
a
nice
clean
little
joint
close
to
the
office
but
i
didn
t
know
when
i
d
get
my
supper
that
night
so
i
called
back
that
s
all
right
sister
but
come
to
the
exchange
minnie
s
head
s
on
the
blink
and
i
ll
stay
on
here
late
anything
up
yes
i
don
t
want
to
talk
about
it
over
the
wire
there
s
been
another
row
morning
it
s
horrible
i
can
t
stand
it
i
ll
tell
you
more
this
evening
so
long
i
put
my
elbows
on
the
table
and
sat
forward
thinking
if
you
d
asked
me
a
year
ago
what
i
wanted
most
in
the
world
i
d
have
said
money
but
i
d
learnt
considerable
since
then
money
don
t
do
it
i
said
to
myself
look
at
the
fowlers
with
their
jewels
and
their
millions
scrapping
till
even
the
housekeeper
on
a
fancy
salary
with
a
private
bath
can
t
stand
it
and
there
came
up
in
my
mind
the
memory
of
the
east
side
tenement
where
i
was
raised
i
thought
of
my
poor
father
most
killed
with
work
and
my
mother
eking
things
out
doing
housecleaning
and
never
a
hard
word
to
each
other
or
to
me
the
night
settled
down
early
black
dark
and
very
still
at
seven
anne
hennessey
came
in
and
sat
down
by
the
radiator
which
was
making
queer
noises
with
the
heat
coming
up
supper
time
s
like
i
turned
round
in
my
chair
ready
for
a
good
talk
and
asked
about
the
trouble
at
mapleshade
oh
it
was
another
quarrel
yesterday
morning
at
breakfast
and
with
harper
the
butler
hearing
every
word
he
said
it
was
the
worst
they
d
ever
had
he
s
a
servant
and
was
shocked
sylvia
and
the
doctor
again
yes
and
poor
fowler
crying
behind
the
coffee
pot
the
same
old
subject
oh
of
course
it
s
young
reddy
this
time
sylvia
s
been
out
a
good
deal
this
autumn
in
her
car
several
times
she
s
been
gone
nearly
the
whole
day
when
the
doctor
questioned
her
she
d
either
be
evasive
or
sulky
on
friday
someone
told
him
they
d
seen
her
far
up
on
the
turnpike
with
jack
reddy
in
his
racer
i
fired
up
i
couldn
t
help
it
why
should
he
be
mad
about
that
isn
t
reddy
good
enough
for
her
think
he
is
i
told
you
before
i
thought
the
best
thing
she
could
do
would
be
to
marry
him
she
looked
round
to
see
that
no
one
was
coming
don
t
say
a
word
of
what
i
m
going
to
tell
you
i
have
no
right
to
repeat
what
i
hear
as
an
employee
but
i
m
worried
and
don
t
know
what
s
the
best
thing
to
do
fowler
has
as
good
as
told
me
that
her
husband
s
lost
all
his
money
and
it
s
sylvia
s
that
s
running
mapleshade
and
what
think
is
that
the
doctor
doesn
t
want
her
to
marry
it
isn
t
her
he
minds
losing
it
s
thirty
thousand
a
year
but
when
she
comes
of
age
she
can
do
what
she
wants
and
if
he
makes
it
so
disagreeable
she
won
t
want
to
live
there
that
s
two
years
off
yet
he
may
recoup
himself
in
that
time
oh
i
see
but
he
can
t
do
any
good
by
fighting
with
her
molly
you
re
a
wise
little
woman
he
can
t
but
he
doesn
t
know
it
he
treats
that
girl
like
a
child
of
five
mark
my
words
there
s
going
to
be
trouble
at
mapleshade
i
thought
of
the
telephone
message
i
d
overheard
the
day
before
and
it
came
to
me
suddenly
what
the
secret
might
be
could
sylvia
have
been
planning
to
run
away
i
didn
t
say
s
natural
to
me
and
you
get
trained
along
those
lines
in
the
telephone
i
sat
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
as
anne
went
on
i
d
leave
only
i
m
so
sorry
for
fowler
she
s
as
helpless
as
a
baby
and
seems
to
cling
to
me
the
other
day
she
told
me
about
her
first
her
husband
didn
t
care
for
her
but
was
crazy
about
s
why
he
left
her
almost
all
his
money
i
wasn
t
listening
much
still
thinking
about
the
secret
if
she
running
away
was
she
going
alone
or
with
jack
reddy
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
window
and
i
saw
without
noticing
particular
the
down
train
from
the
city
draw
into
the
station
and
then
jim
donahue
run
along
the
platform
swinging
a
lantern
as
if
i
was
in
a
dream
i
could
hear
anne
i
call
it
an
unjust
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
his
wife
and
five
millions
to
his
daughter
but
if
sylvia
dies
first
all
the
money
goes
back
to
mrs
fowler
the
train
pulled
out
snorting
like
a
big
animal
jim
disappeared
then
presently
i
saw
him
open
the
depot
door
and
come
slouching
across
the
street
i
knew
he
was
headed
for
the
exchange
thinking
minnie
trail
was
there
he
being
a
widower
with
a
crush
on
minnie
he
came
in
and
after
he
d
got
over
the
shock
of
seeing
me
turned
to
anne
and
said
i
just
been
putting
your
young
lady
on
the
train
anne
gave
a
start
and
stared
at
him
miss
sylvia
she
said
that
s
her
said
jim
warming
his
coat
tails
at
the
radiator
i
could
see
anne
was
awful
surprised
and
was
trying
to
hide
it
who
was
she
with
she
asked
no
one
she
went
up
alone
and
said
she
was
going
to
be
away
for
a
few
days
where
s
she
going
anne
gave
me
a
look
that
said

your
mouth
shut
and
turned
quiet
and
innocent
to
jim
just
for
a
visit
to
friends

s
always
visiting
people
in
new
york
and
philadelphia
jim
stayed
round
a
while
gabbing
with
us
and
then
went
back
to
the
station
when
the
door
shut
on
him
we
stared
at
each
other
with
our
eyes
as
round
as
marbles
oh

almost
in
a
whisper

to
your
room
and
say
nothing
just
as
the
message
was
finished
minnie
trail
came
in
i
made
the
record
of
it
and
then
got
up
asking
her
as
natural
as
you
please
how
she
felt
anne
did
the
same
and
you
d
never
have
thought
to
hear
us
sympathizing
with
her
that
we
were
just
bursting
to
get
outside
when
we
did
we
walked
slow
down
the
street
me
telling
her
what
i
d
heard
all
the
time
i
was
speaking
i
was
thinking
of
sylvia
and
jack
reddy
tearing
away
through
that
still
black
night
flying
along
the
pale
line
of
the
road
flashing
past
the
lights
of
farms
and
country
houses
swinging
down
between
the
rolling
hills
and
out
by
the
open
fields
till
they
d
see
the
glow
of
bloomington
low
down
in
the
sky
it
was
anne
who
brought
me
back
to
where
i
was
she
suddenly
stopped
short
staring
in
front
of
her
and
then
turned
to
me
why
how
can
she
be
eloping
with
reddy
by
the
turnpike
when
jim
donahue
saw
her
get
on
the
train
iv
when
i
come
to
the
next
day
i
can
t
make
my
story
plain
if
i
only
tell
what
i
saw
and
heard
i
didn
t
even
pick
up
the
most
important
message
in
the
tragedy
it
came
at
nine
that
night
through
the
corona
exchange
and
was
sent
from
a
pay
station
so
there
was
no
record
of
it
only
jack
reddy
s
i
m
going
too
fast
that
belongs
later
what
i
ve
got
to
do
is
to
piece
things
together
as
i
got
them
from
the
gossip
in
the
village
from
the
inquest
and
from
the
new
york
papers
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
remember
that
i
m
up
against
a
stunt
that
s
new
to
me
and
that
i
m
trying
to
get
it
over
as
clear
as
i
can
the
best
way
is
for
me
to
put
down
first
sylvia
s
movements
on
that
tragic
sunday
about
five
in
the
afternoon
sylvia
and
fowler
had
tea
in
the
library
when
that
was
went
away
saying
she
was
going
to
her
room
to
write
letters
and
her
mother
retired
to
hers
for
the
nap
she
always
took
before
dinner
what
happened
between
then
and
the
time
when
fowler
sent
the
message
to
the
doctor
i
heard
from
anne
hennessey
it
was
this
way
they
had
dinner
late
at
when
sylvia
didn
t
come
down
fowler
sent
up
harper
to
call
her
he
came
back
saying
she
wasn
t
in
her
room
and
fowler
getting
uneasy
went
up
herself
sending
harper
to
find
virginie
dupont
it
wasn
t
long
before
they
discovered
that
neither
sylvia
nor
virginie
were
in
the
house
when
she
realized
this
fowler
was
terribly
upset
sylvia
s
room
was
in
confusion
the
bureau
drawers
pulled
out
the
closet
doors
open
anne
not
being
there
harper
who
was
scared
at
fowler
s
excitement
called
nora
magee
the
chambermaid
she
was
a
smart
girl
and
saw
pretty
quickly
that
sylvia
had
evidently
left
the
toilet
things
were
gone
from
the
dresser
the
jewelry
case
was
open
and
empty
only
for
a
few
old
pieces
of
no
great
value
it
was
part
of
nora
s
job
to
do
up
the
room
and
she
knew
where
sylvia
s
hudson
seal
coat
hung
in
one
of
the
closets
a
glance
showed
her
that
was
gone
also
a
bag
that
the
doctor
had
given
his
stepdaughter
on
her
birthday
all
the
servants
knew
of
the
quarreling
and
its
cause
and
while
fowler
was
moaning
and
hunting
about
helplessly
nora
went
to
the
desk
and
opened
it
there
lying
careless
as
if
it
had
been
thrown
in
in
a
hurry
was
jack
reddy
s
letter
she
gave
a
glance
at
it
and
handed
it
to
fowler
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
fowler
ran
downstairs
and
telephoned
to
the
doctor
the
poor
lady
was
in
a
terrible
way
and
when
anne
got
back
she
had
to
sit
with
her
trying
to
quiet
her
till
the
doctor
came
back
that
wasn
t
till
nearly
two
in
the
morning
when
he
reached
home
dead
beat
saying
he
d
come
round
the
turnpike
from
the
riven
rock
road
and
seen
no
sign
of
either
sylvia
or
jack
reddy
no
one
at
mapleshade
saw
sylvia
leave
the
house
no
one
in
longwood
saw
her
pass
through
the
village
yet
two
and
a
half
hours
from
the
time
she
had
made
the
date
with
reddy
she
was
seen
again
over
a
hundred
miles
from
her
home
in
the
last
place
anyone
would
have
expected
to
find
her
way
up
on
the
turnpike
two
miles
from
cresset
s
crossing
there
s
a
sort
of
roadhouse
where
the
farm
hands
spend
their
evenings
and
automobilists
stop
for
drinks
and
gasoline
it
s
got
a
shady
reputation
being
frequented
by
a
rough
class
of
people
and
once
there
was
a
laborer
on
cresset
s
there
in
a
drunken
row
it
s
called
the
wayside
arbor
which
doesn
t
fit
sounding
innocent
and
rural
though
in
the
back
there
is
a
trellis
with
grapes
growing
over
it
and
tables
set
out
under
it
in
warm
weather
at
this
season
it
s
a
dreary
looking
spot
an
old
frame
cottage
a
few
yards
back
from
the
road
with
a
piazza
and
a
door
painted
green
leading
into
the
bar
along
the
top
of
the
piazza
goes
the
sign
wayside
arbor
with
advertisements
for
some
kind
of
beer
at
each
end
of
it
and
in
the
window
there
s
more
advertisements
for
whisky
and
crackers
and
soft
drinks
nailed
to
one
of
the
piazza
posts
is
a
public
telephone
sign
standing
out
very
prominent
at
the
time
of
the
hesketh
mystery
i
d
only
seen
it
once
one
day
in
the
summer
when
i
was
out
in
a
hired
car
with
galway
and
two
gentlemen
friends
from
new
york
we
d
been
to
bloomington
by
train
and
were
motoring
back
and
stopped
to
get
some
beer
but
we
ladies
not
liking
the
looks
of
the
place
wouldn
t
go
in
and
had
our
beer
brought
out
to
us
by
the
proprietor
jake
hines
a
customer
in
a
shirt
without
a
collar
and
one
of
his
suspenders
broken
it
s
very
lonesome
round
there
the
nearest
house
is
cresset
s
a
half
mile
away
across
the
fields
back
of
it
and
all
round
is
cresset
s
land
some
of
it
planted
in
crops
and
then
strips
of
woods
making
the
country
in
summer
look
lovely
with
the
dark
and
the
light
green
sunday
evening
there
were
only
two
people
in
the
wayside
arbor
bar
hines
and
his
servant
tecla
rabine
a
bohemian
woman
hines
was
upstairs
in
the
room
above
in
bed
with
a
cold
there
was
a
fire
burning
in
the
stove
as
a
good
many
of
hines
s
customers
were
the
dagoes
that
work
at
cresset
s
and
the
other
farms
and
they
liked
the
place
warm
hines
was
reading
the
paper
and
tecla
rabine
was
cleaning
up
the
bar
before
she
went
upstairs
she
having
a
toothache
and
wanting
to
get
off
to
bed
at
the
inquest
hines
swore
that
he
heard
no
sound
of
a
car
or
of
he
said
he
would
have
noticed
as
that
generally
meant
there
was
a
step
on
the
piazza
the
door
opened
and
a
lady
came
in
he
didn
t
know
who
she
was
but
saw
right
off
she
wasn
t
the
kind
that
you
d
expect
to
see
in
his
place
she
had
on
a
long
dark
fur
coat
a
plush
hat
with
a
shetland
veil
pushed
up
round
the
brim
and
looked
pale
and
he
thought
scared
it
was
sylvia
hesketh
but
he
didn
t
know
that
till
afterward
she
asked
him
right
off
if
she
could
use
his
telephone
and
he
pointed
to
the
booth
in
the
corner
she
went
in
and
closed
the
door
and
hines
stepped
to
the
window
and
looked
out
to
see
if
there
was
a
car
or
a
carriage
that
he
hadn
t
heard
the
mud
making
the
road
soft
but
there
was
nothing
there
before
he
was
through
looking
he
heard
the
booth
door
open
and
turning
back
saw
her
come
out
he
said
she
wasn
t
five
minutes
sending
her
message
that
telephone
message
was
the
most
mysterious
one
in
the
case
it
was
transmitted
through
the
corona
exchange
to
firehill
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
who
heard
it
but
jack
reddy
i
m
going
to
put
it
down
here
copied
from
the
newspaper
reports
of
the
inquest
oh

you

and
don
t
let
anyone
servants
or
anyone
you

got
to
keep
it
quiet
it
s
vitally
important
for
my
sake
come
come
quick
that
was
all
before
he
could
ask
her
a
question
she
d
disconnected
and
naturally
he
made
no
effort
to
find
out
where
the
call
had
come
from
being
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
to
who
was
in
trouble
and
wanted
him
to
come
when
she
came
out
of
the
booth
she
carried
a
small
purse
in
her
hand
and
hines
then
noticed
that
she
had
only
one
glove
that
her
right
hand
was
scratched
in
several
places
thinking
she
looked
cold
he
asked
her
if
she
would
have
something
to
drink
and
she
said
no
then
pushed
back
her
cuff
and
looked
at
a
bracelet
watch
set
in
diamonds
and
sapphires
that
she
wore
on
her
wrist
twenty
minutes
to
ten
she
said
i
ll
wait
here
for
a
little
while
if
you
don
t
mind
she
went
over
to
the
stove
pulled
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
spreading
her
hands
out
to
the
heat
and
when
they
were
warm
opening
her
coat
collar
and
turning
it
back
from
her
neck
both
hines
and
tecla
rabine
noticed
that
her
feet
were
muddy
and
that
there
were
twigs
and
dead
leaves
caught
in
the
edge
of
her
skirt
as
she
didn
t
seem
inclined
to
say
anything
hines
who
admitted
that
he
was
ready
to
burst
with
curiosity
began
to
question
her
trying
to
find
out
where
she
d
come
from
and
what
she
was
waiting
for
you
come
a
long
way
i
guess
he
said
she
just
nodded
from
bloomington
maybe
he
asked
no
the
other
longwood
car
broken
down
he
said
next
and
she
answered
sort
of
indifferent
yes
it
s
down
the
road
maybe
i
might
go
and
lend
a
hand
he
suggested
and
she
answered
quick
to
that
no
it
s
not
necessary
they
can
fix
it
themselves
then
she
added
after
a
minute
i
ve
telephoned
for
someone
to
come
for
me
and
if
the
car
s
really
broken
we
can
tow
it
back
that
seemed
so
straight
and
natural
that
hines
began
to
get
less
curious
still
he
wanted
to
know
who
she
was
and
tried
to
find
out
you
come
a
long
ride
if
you
come
from
longwood
he
said
but
he
didn
t
get
any
satisfaction
for
she
answered
is
it
a
long
way
there
about
a
hundred
and
eighteen
miles
by
the
good
bit
shorter
by
the
firehill
road
but
that
s
pretty
bad
after
these
rains
most
of
the
roads
bad
i
suppose
she
said
as
if
she
wasn
t
thinking
of
her
words
they
were
silent
for
a
bit
then
he
tried
again
what
s
broke
in
your
auto
and
she
answered
that
sharp
as
if
he
annoyed
her
and
she
was
setting
him
back
in
his
place
my
good
man
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
that
s
the
chauffeur
s
business
not
mine
he
asked
her
some
more
questions
but
he
couldn
t
get
anything
out
of
her
he
said
she
treated
him
sort
of
haughty
as
if
she
wanted
him
to
stop
so
after
a
while
he
said
no
more
but
sat
by
the
bar
pretending
to
read
his
paper
tecla
rabine
came
and
went
tidying
up
for
the
night
and
none
of
them
said
a
word
a
little
before
ten
she
got
up
and
buttoned
her
coat
saying
she
was
going
hines
was
surprised
and
asked
her
if
she
wouldn
t
wait
there
for
the
auto
and
she
said
no
she
d
walk
up
the
road
and
meet
it
he
asked
her
which
way
it
was
coming
and
she
said
by
the
firehill
road
how
far
is
that
from
here
he
told
her
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
she
answered
that
she
d
just
about
time
to
get
there
and
catch
it
as
it
came
into
the
turnpike
hines
urged
her
to
stay
but
she
said
no
she
was
cramped
with
sitting
and
needed
a
little
walk
it
was
early
yet
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
she
bid
him
good
night
very
cordial
and
pleasant
and
went
out
he
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
her
as
far
as
he
could
see
then
told
tecla
whose
toothache
was
bad
to
go
to
bed
after
she
d
gone
he
locked
up
went
upstairs
to
his
wife
and
told
her
about
the
strange
lady
his
wife
said
he
d
done
wrong
to
let
her
go
it
wasn
t
right
for
a
person
like
that
to
be
alone
on
such
a
solitary
road
especially
with
some
of
the
farm
hands
queer
foreigners
no
better
than
animals
she
worked
upon
his
feelings
till
she
got
him
nervous
and
he
was
going
to
get
a
lantern
and
start
out
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
an
auto
horn
in
the
distance
he
stepped
to
the
window
and
watched
and
presently
saw
a
big
car
with
one
lamp
dark
coming
at
a
great
clip
down
from
the
firehill
road
direction
the
moon
had
come
out
a
short
while
before
so
that
if
he
d
looked
he
could
have
seen
the
people
in
the
car
but
supposing
it
was
the
one
the
lady
was
waiting
for
he
turned
from
the
window
and
thinking
no
more
about
it
went
to
bed
before
he
was
off
to
sleep
he
heard
another
auto
horn
and
the
whirr
of
a
car
passing
he
couldn
t
say
how
long
after
this
was
as
he
was
half
asleep
how
long
he
d
slept
he
didn
t
really
was
between
four
and
five
in
the
he
was
roused
by
a
great
battering
at
the
door
and
a
sound
of
voices
he
jumped
up
just
as
he
was
ran
to
the
window
and
opened
it
there
in
the
road
he
could
see
clouds
were
gone
the
moon
sailing
clear
and
motor
and
some
people
all
talking
very
excited
and
one
voice
a
woman
s
saying
over
and
over
oh
how
horrible
he
took
them
for
a
party
of
half
drunk
and
wanting
more
and
called
down
fierce
and
savage
what
in
thunder
are
you
doing
there
one
of
them
a
man
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
piazza
looked
up
at
him
and
said
there
s
a
murdered
woman
up
the
road
here
that
s
all
as
he
ran
to
the
place
with
the
were
two
of
told
him
how
they
were
on
a
motor
trip
with
their
wives
and
that
night
were
going
from
bloomington
to
huntley
the
moon
being
so
fine
they
were
going
slow
otherwise
they
never
would
have
found
the
body
which
was
lying
by
the
roadside
a
pile
of
brushwood
had
been
thrown
over
it
but
one
hand
had
fallen
out
beyond
the
branches
and
one
of
the
women
had
seen
it
white
in
the
moonlight
they
had
unfastened
an
auto
lamp
and
it
was
standing
on
the
ground
beside
her
hines
lifted
it
and
looked
at
her
she
lay
partly
on
her
side
her
coat
loosely
drawn
round
her
the
right
arm
was
flung
out
as
if
when
the
body
stiffened
it
might
have
slipped
down
from
a
position
across
the
chest
as
he
held
the
lantern
close
he
saw
below
the
hat
pulled
down
on
her
head
with
the
torn
rags
of
veil
still
clinging
to
it
a
thin
line
of
blood
running
down
to
where
the
pearl
necklace
rested
untouched
round
her
throat
it
was
sylvia
hesketh
her
skull
fractured
by
a
blow
that
had
cracked
her
head
like
an
egg
shell
v
there
were
so
many
puzzling
leads
and
so
much
that
was
inexplicable
and
mysterious
in
the
hesketh
case
that
it
ll
be
easier
to
follow
if
in
this
chapter
i
put
down
what
the
other
people
who
were
either
suspects
or
important
witnesses
did
on
that
sunday
some
of
it
may
not
be
interesting
but
it
s
necessary
to
know
if
you
re
going
to
get
a
clear
understanding
of
a
case
that
baffled
the
police
and
pretty
nearly
there
i
go
again
but
it
s
awfully
hard
when
you
re
not
used
to
it
to
keep
things
in
their
right
order
i
ve
told
how
jim
donahue
said
he
put
sylvia
on
the
train
for
the
junction
that
night
at
both
jim
and
the
ticket
agent
said
they
d
seen
her
and
jim
had
spoken
to
her
she
carried
a
hand
bag
wore
a
long
dark
fur
coat
and
a
small
hat
that
showed
her
hair
both
men
also
noticed
in
her
hand
the
gold
mesh
purse
with
a
diamond
monogram
that
she
always
carried
over
her
face
was
tied
a
black
figured
veil
that
hid
her
features
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
hair
the
voice
or
the
gold
mesh
purse
sands
the
pullman
conductor
said
this
same
woman
rode
down
in
his
train
to
the
junction
where
she
got
off
clark
the
station
agent
at
the
junction
saw
her
step
from
the
car
to
the
platform
after
that
he
lost
track
of
her
as
he
was
busy
with
the
branch
line
train
which
left
at
and
was
the
last
one
up
that
night
no
woman
went
on
it
there
were
only
two
passengers
both
men
the
doctor
didn
t
make
his
whole
story
public
till
the
inquest
they
said
afterward
the
police
knew
it
but
it
was
his
policy
to
say
little
and
keep
quiet
in
mapleshade
what
we
in
the
village
did
from
the
papers
partly
from
that
after
the
message
from
fowler
saying
sylvia
had
eloped
he
told
dalzell
he
would
have
to
leave
having
been
called
away
to
an
important
case
when
the
dalzells
chauffeur
brought
his
car
round
he
asked
the
man
several
questions
about
the
shortest
way
to
get
to
the
turnpike
the
chauffeur
told
him
that
the
best
traveling
would
be
by
the
riven
rock
road
which
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
junction
to
get
the
doctor
left
the
dalzells
at
a
little
after
eight
alone
in
his
car
he
reached
the
junction
about
a
few
minutes
after
the
train
from
longwood
had
arrived
on
the
platform
he
spoke
to
clark
asking
him
how
to
get
to
the
riven
rock
road
clark
gave
him
the
directions
then
saw
him
disappear
round
the
station
building
neither
clark
nor
anyone
at
the
were
very
few
there
at
that
him
leave
in
his
car
though
they
heard
the
honk
of
the
auto
horn
but
it
was
jack
reddy
s
movements
that
everybody
was
most
interested
in
there
was
no
secret
about
them
sunday
at
lunch
he
told
gilsey
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
trip
for
a
few
days
if
he
stayed
longer
than
he
expected
he
d
wire
back
for
his
things
but
as
it
was
he
d
only
want
his
small
auto
trunk
which
he
d
take
with
him
when
gilsey
was
packing
this
he
joked
her
about
having
a
good
time
while
he
was
gone
and
she
told
him
that
as
there
d
be
no
dinner
that
night
she
and
gilsey
d
go
over
to
a
neighbor
s
take
supper
there
and
spend
the
evening
after
that
he
asked
casey
the
chauffeur
to
have
the
racing
car
brought
round
at
five
to
see
that
the
tank
was
full
a
footwarmer
in
it
and
the
heaviest
rugs
and
a
drum
of
gasoline
as
he
was
going
on
a
long
trip
at
five
he
left
firehill
in
the
racer
at
a
quarter
to
seven
two
boys
saw
him
pass
the
longwood
station
in
the
direction
of
maple
lane
he
said
he
came
back
through
the
outskirts
of
the
village
at
but
no
one
could
be
found
who
had
seen
him
after
he
left
firehill
the
gilseys
cleared
up
and
walked
across
the
fields
to
the
jaycocks
farm
where
they
spent
the
evening
coming
home
at
ten
and
finding
the
house
dark
and
quiet
casey
went
to
another
neighbor
s
where
he
stayed
till
midnight
playing
cards
he
slept
over
the
garage
and
about
four
in
the
looked
at
his
watch
awakened
by
a
sound
down
below
in
the
garage
he
listened
and
made
sure
that
someone
was
trying
to
roll
the
doors
back
very
slow
and
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
casey
s
a
bold
nervy
boy
and
he
reached
for
his
revolver
and
crept
barefooted
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
on
the
top
step
he
stooped
down
and
looked
through
the
banisters
and
saw
against
the
big
square
of
the
open
doors
a
man
standing
with
a
car
behind
him
shining
in
the
moonlight
he
thought
it
was
a
burglar
so
with
his
revolver
up
and
ready
he
called
hello
there
what
are
you
doing
the
man
gave
a
great
start
and
then
he
heard
reddy
s
voice
oh
casey
did
i
wake
you
i
ve
come
back
unexpectedly
help
me
get
this
car
in
they
ran
the
car
in
and
when
casey
went
to
tell
how
he
thought
it
was
a
burglar
and
was
going
to
shoot
he
noticed
that
reddy
hardly
listened
to
him
but
was
gruff
and
short
all
he
said
was
that
he
d
changed
his
mind
about
the
trip
and
then
unstrapped
his
trunk
from
the
back
and
turned
to
go
in
the
doorway
he
stopped
as
if
he
d
had
a
sudden
thought
and
said
over
his
shoulder
you
don
t
want
to
mention
this
in
longwood
i
m
getting
a
little
sick
of
the
gossip
there
over
my
affairs
casey
went
back
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
when
he
looked
at
the
car
found
it
was
caked
with
mud
even
the
spattered
at
seven
he
crossed
over
to
the
house
for
his
breakfast
and
told
the
gilseys
that
reddy
was
back
they
were
surprised
but
decided
as
he
d
been
out
so
late
they
d
not
disturb
him
till
he
rang
for
his
breakfast
monday
morning
was
clear
and
sharp
the
first
real
frost
of
the
season
all
the
time
i
was
dressing
i
was
thinking
about
the
elopement
and
how
queer
it
was
fowler
saying
they
d
gone
by
turnpike
and
jim
donahue
saying
he
d
seen
sylvia
leave
on
the
train
i
worked
it
out
that
they
d
made
some
change
of
plans
at
the
last
moment
but
the
they
d
eloped
didn
t
matter
to
me
small
things
like
that
didn
t
cut
any
ice
when
i
was
all
tormented
wondering
if
it
was
for
the
best
that
my
hero
should
marry
a
wild
girl
who
no
one
could
control
i
hadn
t
been
long
at
the
switchboard
and
was
sitting
sideways
in
my
chair
looking
out
of
the
window
when
i
saw
fowler
s
auto
drive
up
with
the
doctor
and
a
strange
man
in
it
i
twirled
round
quick
and
was
the
operator
i
ll
bet
no
one
would
have
thought
that
the
girl
sitting
so
calm
and
indifferent
in
that
swivel
chair
was
just
boiling
with
excitement
and
curiosity
the
doctor
looked
bad
yellow
as
wax
with
his
eyes
sunk
and
inflamed
he
didn
t
take
any
notice
of
me
beside
a
fierce
sort
of
look
and
a
gruff
give
me
corona
that
was
firehill
i
jacked
in
and
the
doctor
went
into
the
booth
and
shut
the
door
the
strange
man
stood
with
his
hands
behind
him
looking
out
of
the
window
i
didn
t
know
then
that
he
was
a
detective
and
i
don
t
think
anyone
ever
would
have
guessed
it
if
you
d
asked
me
i
d
have
said
he
looked
more
like
a
clerk
at
the
ribbon
counter
but
that
s
what
he
was
walter
mills
by
name
engaged
that
morning
as
we
afterward
knew
by
the
doctor
watching
him
with
one
eye
i
leaned
forward
very
cautiously
lifted
up
the
cam
and
listened
in
on
the
conversation
is
this
gilsey
then
gilsey
s
nice
old
voice
yes
sir
who
is
it
the
doctor
s
was
quick
and
hard
never
mind
doesn
t
matter
do
you
happen
to
know
where
reddy
is
my
heart
gave
a
big
hadn
t
caught
them
they
d
got
away
and
been
married
yes
sir
reddy
s
here
there
was
just
a
minute
s
pause
before
the
doctor
answered
in
that
minute
all
sorts
of
ideas
went
flashing
through
my
head
the
way
they
say
you
see
things
before
you
drown
then
came
the
doctor
s
voice
with
a
curious
sort
of
quietness
in
it
at
firehill
yes
sir
can
i
take
any
message
reddy
was
out
very
late
last
night
and
isn
t
up
yet
the
doctor
answered
that
very
cordially
all
the
hurry
and
hardness
gone
oh
that
s
all
right
i
ll
not
disturb
him
no
i
won
t
bother
with
a
message
i
ll
call
up
later
thanks
very
much
i
dropped
back
in
my
chair
tapping
with
a
pencil
on
the
corner
of
the
drawer
and
looking
sideways
at
the
doctor
as
he
came
out
of
the
booth
he
had
a
queer
look
his
eyes
keen
and
bright
and
there
was
some
color
in
his
face
the
strange
man
turned
round
and
the
doctor
gave
him
a
glance
sharp
as
a
razor
but
all
he
said
was
come
on
mills
and
they
went
out
and
mounted
into
the
car
when
the
door
banged
on
them
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
flattened
out
against
the
chair
back
they
eloped
gee
it
was
a
relief
not
because
of
myself
honest
to
god
that
s
straight
i
knew
i
couldn
t
have
him
any
more
than
i
could
have
had
the
kohinoor
diamond
it
was
because
i
down
where
you
feel
the
sylvia
hesketh
wasn
t
the
girl
for
him
to
marry
that
was
about
eight
it
was
after
ten
when
a
message
came
for
mapleshade
that
made
the
world
turn
upside
down
and
left
me
white
and
sick

that
morning
on
the
turnpike

it
anne
hennessey
told
me
afterward
that
she
heard
her
scream
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
i
heard
it
too
and
it
raised
then
a
lot
of
words
coming
thin
and
shrill
along
the
wire
sylvia
my
it
was
awful
i
hate
to
think
of
it
nora
and
anne
ran
at
the
sound
and
found
fowler
all
wild
and
screaming
with
the
receiver
hanging
down
i
could
hear
them
a
babble
of
tiny
little
voices
as
if
i
had
a
line
on
some
part
of
purgatory
where
the
spirits
were
crying
and
wailing
suddenly
it
had
hung
up
i
waited
shaking
there
like
a
leaf
and
feeling
like
i
d
a
blow
in
the
stomach
then
mapleshade
called
and
i
heard
anne
s
voice
distinct
but
broken
as
if
she
d
been
running
molly
is
that
you
do
you
by
any
chance
know
if
the
doctor
s
in
the
village
he
was
here
a
little
while
ago
with
a
man
calling
up
firehill
anne
i
can
t
be
true
oh
it
can
t
talk
now
i
ve
to
find
him
give
me
firehill
he
may
have
gone
there
quick
for
god
s
sake
i
gave
it
and
heard
her
tell
a
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
i
ll
go
on
from
here
and
tell
what
happened
at
firehill
i
ve
pieced
it
out
from
the
testimony
at
the
inquest
and
from
what
the
gilseys
afterward
told
in
the
village
the
doctor
and
mills
went
straight
out
there
from
the
exchange
when
they
arrived
gilsey
told
him
reddy
wasn
t
up
yet
but
he
d
call
him
the
doctor
however
said
the
matter
was
urgent
and
they
couldn
t
lose
a
minute
so
the
three
of
them
went
upstairs
together
and
gilsey
knocked
at
the
door
after
he
d
knocked
twice
a
sleepy
voice
called
out
come
in
and
gilsey
opened
the
door
it
led
into
a
with
a
bedroom
opening
off
it
on
a
sofa
just
opposite
the
door
was
jack
reddy
dressed
and
stretched
out
as
if
he
d
been
asleep
at
first
he
saw
no
one
but
gilsey
and
sat
up
with
a
start
saying
sharply
what
s
the
matter
does
anyone
want
me
gilsey
said
yes
two
gentlemen
to
see
you
and
stepped
to
one
side
to
let
the
doctor
and
mills
enter
when
reddy
saw
the
doctor
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
at
him
he
didn
t
say
good
morning
or
any
sort
of
greeting
but
was
silent
as
if
he
was
holding
himself
still
waiting
to
hear
what
the
doctor
was
going
to
say
he
hadn
t
to
wait
long
the
doctor
in
the
doorway
went
right
to
the
point
reddy
said
he
where
s
my
daughter
reddy
answered
in
a
quiet
composed
voice
i
don
t
know
dr
fowler
you
do
shouted
the
doctor
you
ran
away
with
her
last
night
what
have
you
done
with
her
reddy
said
in
the
same
dignified
way
i
haven
t
done
anything
i
know
nothing
about
her
i
haven
t
any
more
idea
than
you
where
she
is
at
that
the
doctor
got
beside
himself
he
shouted
out
furiously
you
have
you
liar
and
i
ll
get
it
out
of
you
and
he
made
a
lunge
at
reddy
to
seize
him
but
mills
jumped
in
and
grabbed
his
arm
holding
it
he
said
trying
to
quiet
down
the
doctor
just
wait
a
minute
fowler
maybe
when
reddy
sees
that
we
understand
the
situation
he
ll
be
willing
to
explain
then
he
turned
to
reddy
there
s
no
good
prevaricating
your
letter
to
miss
hesketh
has
been
found
now
we
re
all
agreed
that
we
don
t
want
any
talk
or
scandal
about
this
if
you
want
to
get
out
of
the
affair
without
trouble
to
yourself
and
others
you
d
better
tell
the
truth
where
is
she
who
the
devil
are
you
reddy
cried
out
suddenly
as
mad
as
the
doctor
and
before
mills
could
answer
the
branch
telephone
on
the
desk
rang
reddy
gave
a
loud
exclamation
and
made
a
jump
for
it
but
mills
got
before
him
and
caught
him
he
struggled
to
get
away
till
the
doctor
seized
him
on
the
other
side
they
fought
for
a
moment
and
then
got
him
back
against
the
door
all
the
time
the
telephone
ringing
like
mad
as
they
wrestled
with
him
mills
called
over
his
shoulder
to
gilsey
answer
that
telephone
quick
gilsey
scared
most
out
of
his
wits
ran
to
the
phone
and
took
down
the
receiver
anne
hennessey
was
at
the
other
end
with
her
awful
message
when
he
got
it
gilsey
gave
a
cry
like
he
was
stabbed
and
turned
to
reddy
pinioned
against
the
door
good
lord
have
mercy
jack
he
gasped
out
miss
hesketh
s
dead
she
s
the
last
night
the
doctor
dropped
reddy
tore
the
instrument
out
of
gilsey
s
hand
and
took
the
rest
of
the
message
reddy
turned
the
color
of
ashes
there
wasn
t
any
need
to
hold
him
he
fell
back
against
the
door
with
his
jaw
dropped
and
his
eyes
staring
like
a
man
in
a
trance
gilsey
thought
he
was
going
to
die
and
was
for
running
to
him
crying
out
oh
jack
don
t
look
that
way
but
mills
caught
the
old
servant
by
the
arm
and
held
him
back
watching
reddy
as
sharp
as
a
ferret
the
doctor
turned
from
the
phone
and
said
it
s
true
miss
hesketh
s
been
murdered
there
was
a
dead
silence
the
click
of
the
receiver
falling
into
its
hook
was
the
only
sound
the
three
other
doctor
as
white
as
death
staring
at
reddy
and
then
seeing
those
three
faces
he
burst
out
like
he
was
crazy
s
can
t
be
i
was
there
i
went
the
moment
i
got
her
message
i
was
on
the
turnpike
where
she
said
she
d
be
i
was
up
and
down
there
most
of
the
night
he
stopped
suddenly
and
put
his
hands
over
his
face
groaning
oh
my
god
didn
t
you
tell
me
he
lurched
forward
and
dropped
into
a
chair
his
hands
over
his
face
moaning
like
an
animal
in
pain
vi
longwood
was
stunned
by
noon
everybody
knew
it
and
there
was
no
more
business
that
day
the
people
stood
in
groups
talking
in
whispers
as
if
they
were
at
a
funeral
and
in
the
afternoon
it
like
a
funeral
the
body
coming
back
by
train
and
being
taken
from
the
depot
to
mapleshade
in
one
of
the
doctor
s
farm
wagons
it
lay
under
a
sheet
and
as
the
wagon
passed
through
the
crowd
you
couldn
t
hear
a
sound
except
for
a
woman
crying
here
and
there
then
it
was
as
if
a
spring
that
held
the
people
dumb
and
still
was
loosed
and
the
excitement
burst
up
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
it
seemed
like
every
village
up
and
down
the
line
had
emptied
itself
into
longwood
farmers
and
laborers
and
loafers
swarmed
along
the
streets
the
rich
came
in
motors
tearing
to
mapleshade
and
the
police
were
everywhere
as
if
they
d
sprung
out
of
the
ground
by
afternoon
the
reporters
came
pouring
in
from
town
the
inn
was
full
up
with
them
and
they
were
buzzing
round
my
exchange
like
flies
some
of
them
tried
to
get
hold
of
me
and
that
night
had
the
nerve
to
come
knocking
at
galway
s
side
door
demanding
the
telephone
girl
but
believe
me
i
sat
tight
and
said
to
them
the
police
were
after
me
mighty
quick
and
there
was
a
séance
over
corwin
s
drug
store
when
i
felt
like
i
was
being
put
to
the
third
degree
i
told
them
all
i
knew
job
or
no
job
for
i
guessed
right
off
that
that
talk
i
d
overheard
on
the
phone
might
be
an
important
clew
they
kept
it
close
it
wasn
t
till
after
the
inquest
that
the
press
got
it
before
the
inquest
every
sort
of
rumor
was
flying
about
and
the
papers
were
full
of
crazy
stories
not
half
of
them
true
i
d
read
about
places
and
people
i
knew
as
well
as
my
own
face
in
the
mirror
and
they
d
sound
like
a
dime
novel
so
colored
up
and
twisted
round
the
oldest
inhabitant
wouldn
t
have
recognized
them
to
get
at
the
facts
was
a
job
but
knowing
who
was
reliable
and
who
wasn
t
i
questioned
and
ferreted
and
i
guess
before
i
was
done
i
had
them
pretty
straight
sylvia
had
been
killed
by
a
blow
on
the
side
of
her
terrible
blow
a
sheriff
s
deputy
i
know
told
me
that
in
all
his
experience
he
had
seen
nothing
worse
her
hat
had
evidently
shielded
the
scalp
it
was
pulled
well
down
over
her
head
the
long
pin
bent
but
still
thrust
through
it
where
she
had
been
hit
the
plush
was
torn
but
not
the
thick
interlining
and
her
hair
all
loosened
was
hanging
down
against
her
neck
there
was
a
deep
more
like
a
tearing
of
the
skin
on
the
lower
part
of
her
cheek
it
was
agreed
that
she
had
been
struck
only
once
by
some
heavy
implement
that
had
a
sharp
or
jagged
edge
though
the
woods
and
fields
had
been
thoroughly
searched
nothing
had
been
discovered
that
could
have
dealt
the
blow
whatever
he
had
used
the
murderer
had
either
successfully
hidden
it
or
taken
it
away
with
him
the
deputy
told
me
it
looked
to
him
as
if
it
might
have
been
some
farming
tool
like
a
spade
or
even
a
heavy
branch
broken
from
a
tree
the
way
the
body
was
arranged
the
coat
drawn
smoothly
together
the
branches
completely
covering
her
showed
that
the
murderer
had
taken
time
to
conceal
his
crime
though
why
he
had
not
drawn
the
body
back
into
the
thick
growth
of
bushes
was
a
point
that
puzzled
everybody
it
was
impossible
to
trace
any
footprints
as
the
automobile
party
and
hines
had
trodden
the
earth
about
her
into
a
muddy
mass
and
the
grass
along
the
edge
was
too
thick
and
springy
to
hold
any
impression
close
behind
the
place
where
she
lay
twigs
of
the
screening
trees
were
snapped
and
bent
as
if
her
assailant
had
broken
through
them
there
were
people
who
said
hines
would
have
been
arrested
on
the
spot
if
robbery
had
been
added
to
murder
but
the
jewelry
was
all
on
her
more
than
he
said
he
had
noticed
when
she
was
in
the
wayside
arbor
the
pearl
necklace
alone
was
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
just
below
it
clasping
her
gown
over
the
chest
was
a
diamond
cross
an
old
ornament
of
her
mother
s
made
of
the
finest
brazilian
stones
in
the
pocket
of
her
coat
was
a
purse
with
dollars
in
it
so
right
at
the
start
the
theory
of
robbery
was
abandoned
another
inexplicable
thing
was
the
disappearance
of
the
french
maid
virginia
dupont
jack
reddy
denied
any
knowledge
of
her
he
said
sylvia
had
never
mentioned
bringing
her
with
them
and
he
didn
t
think
intended
to
do
so
the
mapleshade
people
thought
differently
all
declaring
that
sylvia
depended
on
her
and
took
her
wherever
she
went
one
of
the
mysteries
about
the
woman
that
was
quickly
cleared
up
was
the
walk
she
had
taken
to
the
village
on
sunday
morning
this
was
to
meet
reddy
and
take
from
him
the
letter
for
sylvia
which
had
been
found
in
the
desk
i
know
from
what
i
heard
that
the
police
were
keen
to
find
her
but
she
had
dropped
out
of
sight
without
leaving
a
trace
no
one
at
mapleshade
knew
anything
about
her
or
her
connections
she
was
not
liked
in
the
house
or
the
village
and
had
made
no
friends
on
her
free
sundays
she
d
go
to
town
and
when
she
returned
say
very
little
about
where
she
d
been
a
search
of
her
rooms
showed
nothing
except
that
she
seemed
to
have
left
her
clothes
behind
her
she
was
last
seen
at
mapleshade
by
nora
magee
who
at
five
on
sunday
met
her
on
the
third
floor
stairs
nora
was
off
for
a
walk
to
the
village
with
harper
and
was
in
a
hurry
she
asked
virginie
if
she
was
going
out
and
virginie
said
no
she
felt
sick
and
was
going
up
to
lie
down
till
she
d
be
wanted
to
help
miss
sylvia
dress
for
dinner
if
you
ask
me
was
anyone
suspected
at
this
stage
i
d
answer
yes
but
people
were
afraid
to
say
who
there
was
talk
about
hines
on
the
street
and
in
the
postoffice
but
it
was
only
when
you
were
close
shut
in
your
own
room
or
walking
quiet
up
a
side
street
that
the
person
with
you
would
whisper
the
doctor
s
name
nobody
dared
say
it
aloud
but
there
wasn
t
a
soul
in
longwood
who
didn
t
know
about
the
quarreling
at
mapleshade
whose
was
the
money
that
ran
it
and
the
will
that
left
everything
to
fowler
if
her
daughter
died
but
no
arrests
were
made
everything
was
waiting
on
the
inquest
and
we
all
heard
that
there
were
important
known
to
the
would
not
be
made
public
till
then
wednesday
afternoon
they
held
the
inquest
at
mapleshade
the
authorities
had
rounded
up
a
bunch
of
witnesses
i
among
them
the
work
in
the
exchange
had
piled
up
so
we
d
had
to
send
a
hurry
call
for
help
to
headquarters
and
i
left
the
office
in
charge
of
a
new
girl
katie
reilly
irish
a
tall
gawky
thing
who
was
going
to
work
with
us
hereafter
on
split
hours
going
down
maple
lane
it
was
like
a
target
club
outing
or
a
political
picnic
except
for
the
solemn
faces
i
saw
hines
and
his
party
and
the
railway
men
and
a
lot
of
queer
guys
that
i
took
to
be
the
jury
halfway
there
a
gang
of
reporters
passed
me
talking
loud
and
swinging
along
in
their
big
overcoats
near
the
black
pine
the
toot
of
a
horn
made
me
stand
back
and
jack
reddy
s
roadster
scudded
by
he
driving
with
casey
beside
him
and
the
two
old
gilseys
pale
and
peaked
in
the
back
seat
they
held
the
inquest
in
the
with
the
coroner
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
long
shiny
table
and
the
jury
grouped
round
the
other
take
it
from
me
it
was
a
gloomy
sight
the
day
outside
was
cold
and
cloudy
and
through
the
french
windows
that
looked
out
on
the
lawns
the
light
came
still
and
gray
making
the
faces
look
paler
than
they
already
were
it
was
a
grand
beautiful
room
with
a
carved
stone
fireplace
where
logs
were
burning
back
against
the
walls
were
sideboards
with
silver
dishes
on
them
and
portraits
hung
on
the
walls
but
the
thing
you
couldn
t
help
looking
that
made
all
the
splendor
just
sylvia
s
clothes
hanging
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
on
a
little
table
near
them
her
hat
and
veil
the
one
glove
she
had
had
on
and
the
heap
of
jewelry
all
those
fine
garments
and
the
precious
stones
worth
a
fortune
seemed
so
pitiful
and
useless
now
we
were
awful
silent
at
first
a
crowd
of
people
sitting
along
the
walls
staring
straight
ahead
or
looking
on
the
ground
now
and
then
someone
would
move
uneasily
and
make
a
rustle
but
there
were
moments
so
still
you
could
hear
the
fire
snapping
and
the
scratching
of
the
reporters
pencils
they
were
just
behind
me
bunched
up
at
a
table
in
front
of
the
window
when
the
doctor
came
in
everyone
was
as
quiet
as
death
and
the
eyes
on
him
were
like
the
eyes
of
images
so
fixed
and
steady
fowler
was
not
sent
for
her
nora
and
anne
were
there
as
pale
as
ghosts
the
coroner
opened
up
by
telling
about
how
and
where
the
deceased
had
been
found
the
position
the
surroundings
and
then
called
graham
who
was
the
county
physician
and
had
made
the
autopsy
a
good
deal
of
what
he
said
i
didn
t
was
to
prove
that
death
resulted
from
a
fracture
of
the
skull
he
could
not
state
the
exact
hour
of
dissolution
but
said
it
was
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
night
some
time
before
twelve
he
described
the
condition
of
the
scalp
which
had
been
partially
protected
by
the
hat
thick
as
it
was
with
a
plush
outside
and
a
heavy
interlining
this
was
held
up
and
then
given
to
the
jury
to
examine
i
saw
it
plainly
as
they
passed
it
from
hand
to
small
dark
automobile
hat
with
a
tear
in
one
side
and
some
shreds
of
black
shetland
veil
hanging
to
its
edge
she
bore
no
other
marks
of
violence
save
a
few
small
scratches
on
her
right
hand
she
had
evidently
been
attacked
unexpectedly
and
had
had
no
time
to
fight
or
struggle
the
automobilists
who
had
found
the
body
came
next
only
the
men
were
ladies
having
been
excused
they
told
what
i
have
already
written
one
of
them
making
the
creeps
go
down
your
spine
describing
how
his
wife
said
she
saw
the
hand
in
the
moonlight
and
how
he
walked
back
laughing
and
pulled
off
the
brushwood
after
that
fowler
came
all
swathed
up
in
black
and
looking
like
a
haggard
old
woman
the
coroner
spoke
very
kind
to
her
when
she
got
to
the
quarrel
between
sylvia
and
the
doctor
her
voice
began
to
tremble
and
she
could
hardly
go
on
it
was
pitiful
to
see
but
she
had
to
tell
it
and
about
the
other
quarrels
too
then
she
pulled
herself
together
and
told
about
going
up
to
sylvia
s
room
and
finding
the
letter
the
coroner
stopped
her
there
and
taking
a
folded
paper
from
the
table
beside
him
said
it
was
the
letter
and
read
it
out
to
us
it
was
dated
firehill
all
right
this
evening
at
seven
by
the
pine
we
ll
go
in
my
racer
to
bloomington
and
be
married
there
by
fiske
the
man
i
told
you
about
it
ll
be
a
long
ride
but
at
the
end
we
ll
find
happiness
waiting
for
us
don
t
disappoint
t
do
what
you
did
the
other
time
believe
in
my
love
and
trust
yourself
to
in
the
silence
that
followed
you
could
hear
the
fire
falling
together
with
a
little
soft
rustle
all
the
eyes
turned
as
if
they
were
on
pivots
and
looked
at
jack
but
mine
i
kept
them
on
fowler
and
never
moved
them
till
she
was
led
bent
and
sobbing
out
of
the
room
nora
magee
was
the
next
and
i
heard
them
say
afterward
made
a
good
witness
the
coroner
asked
anne
when
her
turn
particular
about
the
jewelry
what
was
gone
how
many
pieces
and
such
questions
and
then
it
came
out
that
even
exactly
what
sylvia
had
she
was
all
the
time
buying
new
ornaments
or
having
her
old
ones
reset
and
the
only
person
who
kept
track
of
her
possessions
was
virginie
dupont
all
any
of
them
could
be
sure
of
was
that
the
jewel
box
was
empty
and
the
toilet
articles
fitted
bag
and
gold
mesh
purse
were
gone
hines
was
called
after
that
he
was
all
slicked
up
in
his
store
clothes
and
looked
very
different
to
what
he
had
that
day
in
the
summer
though
anyone
could
see
he
was
scared
blue
the
perspiration
on
his
forehead
and
his
big
knotty
hands
twiddling
at
his
tie
and
his
watch
chain
he
told
his
story
very
clear
and
straightforward
i
think
everyone
was
impressed
by
it
and
by
hines
who
followed
him
she
was
a
miserable
looking
little
rat
of
a
woman
with
inflamed
eyes
and
a
long
drooping
nose
but
she
corroborated
all
he
said
to
sounded
true
tecla
rabine
the
bohemian
servant
followed
and
when
she
walked
over
to
sit
in
the
chair
keyed
up
as
i
was
i
came
near
laughing
she
was
a
large
fat
woman
with
a
red
face
and
little
twinkling
eyes
and
she
sure
was
a
sight
bulging
out
of
a
black
cloth
suit
that
was
the
fashion
when
columbus
landed
on
her
head
was
a
fancy
straw
hat
with
one
mangy
feather
sticking
straight
up
at
the
back
and
the
last
touch
was
her
face
one
side
still
swollen
out
from
her
toothache
and
looking
for
all
the
world
as
if
she
had
a
quid
in
her
cheek
though
she
spoke
in
a
queer
foreign
dialect
she
gave
her
testimony
very
well
and
she
told
something
that
no
don
t
think
even
the
heard
before
while
hines
was
locking
up
she
went
to
her
room
but
couldn
t
sleep
because
of
the
pain
of
her
toothache
ach
she
said
spreading
her
hand
out
near
her
cheek
it
was
out
so
out
and
oh
my
never
mind
your
toothache
said
the
keep
to
the
subject
how
do
i
hear
noises
if
my
toothache
doesn
t
make
me
to
wake
she
asked
giving
him
a
sort
of
indignant
look
somebody
laughed
a
kind
of
choked
giggle
and
i
heard
one
of
those
fresh
chaps
behind
me
whisper
this
is
the
comic
relief
oh
you
heard
kind
of
noises
the
scream
she
said
you
heard
a
scream
away
up
toward
cresset
s
crossing
i
go
crazy
with
the
pain
and
after
hines
is
come
upstairs
i
go
down
to
the
kitchen
to
she
stopped
looking
up
in
the
what
you
call
him
put
her
hand
flat
on
the
side
of
her
for
here
to
stop
the
pain
do
you
mean
a
poultice
she
grinned
all
over
and
nodded
yes
that
s
him
i
make
hot
water
on
the
gas
and
then
way
off
i
hear
a
scream
what
time
was
that
the
kitchen
clock
says
ten
minutes
past
ten
what
did
you
do
she
looked
surprised
i
make
know
the
my
ache
didn
t
you
go
out
and
go
to
the
door
she
shook
her
head
and
gave
a
sort
of
laugh
as
if
she
was
explaining
things
to
a
child
go
out
for
why
if
i
go
out
for
screams
i
go
out
when
the
dagoes
fight
and
when
the
automobiles
be
and
down
all
night
often
drunken
and
making
noises
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
sort
of
careless
i
no
be
bothered
with
screams
did
you
go
to
bed
i
do
i
make
the
medicine
for
my
swole
up
face
and
go
upstairs
did
you
hear
any
more
screams
are
no
more
if
there
are
i
would
have
hear
them
for
i
can
t
sleep
ever
all
night
all
i
hear
is
automobiles
passing
up
and
down
and
three
four
horns
sounding
the
coroner
asked
her
a
few
more
questions
principally
about
hines
movements
and
her
answers
if
you
could
get
over
the
lingo
were
all
clear
and
in
line
with
what
hines
had
said
the
railway
men
followed
her
sands
and
clark
and
jim
donahue
jim
was
as
nervous
as
a
cat
holding
his
hat
in
his
hands
and
twisting
it
round
like
a
plate
he
was
drying
he
told
about
the
woman
he
put
on
the
train
on
sunday
night
where
did
you
first
see
this
woman
he
was
asked
on
the
platform
just
before
the
train
came
in
she
came
down
along
it
out
of
the
dark
can
you
swear
it
was
miss
hesketh
jim
didn
t
think
he
could
swear
because
he
couldn
t
see
her
face
plain
it
being
covered
with
a
figured
black
veil
but
he
never
thought
of
it
being
anyone
else
why
did
you
think
it
was
she
because
it
looked
like
her
it
was
her
coat
and
her
gold
purse
and
i
d
know
her
hair
anywhere
and
when
i
spoke
to
her
and
said
good
evening
miss
hesketh
going
to
leave
us
it
was
her
voice
that
answered
yes
jim
i
m
going
away
for
a
few
did
you
have
any
more
conversation
with
her
no
because
the
train
came
along
then
she
got
in
and
i
handed
her
her
bag
and
said
good
when
he
was
asked
to
describe
the
bag
he
said
he
hadn
t
noticed
it
except
that
it
was
a
medium
sized
bag
he
thought
dark
colored
then
he
was
shown
the
was
the
coroner
held
them
up
the
long
fur
coat
the
little
plush
hat
and
the
one
glove
he
thought
they
were
the
same
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
platform
being
so
it
was
them
sort
of
clothes
the
lady
had
on
and
though
he
couldn
t
be
sure
of
the
glove
he
had
noticed
that
her
gloves
were
light
colored
sands
the
pullman
conductor
and
clark
from
the
junction
testified
that
they
d
seen
the
same
woman
on
the
train
and
at
the
junction
sands
particularly
noticed
the
gold
mesh
purse
because
she
took
her
ticket
out
of
it
he
addressed
her
as
miss
hesketh
and
she
had
answered
him
but
only
to
say
good
evening
then
came
the
firehill
servants
the
two
old
gilseys
were
dreadfully
upset
gilsey
cried
and
poor
old
david
kept
hesitating
and
looking
at
reddy
but
the
stamp
of
truth
was
on
every
word
they
said
casey
followed
them
telling
what
i
ve
already
written
when
reddy
was
called
a
sort
of
stir
went
over
the
people
everybody
was
curious
to
hear
his
story
as
we
d
only
got
bits
of
it
most
of
them
wild
rumors
and
there
wasn
t
a
soul
in
longwood
that
didn
t
grieve
for
him
plunged
down
at
the
moment
when
he
thought
he
was
most
happy
into
such
an
awful
tragedy
as
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
opposite
the
coroner
the
room
was
as
still
as
a
tomb
even
the
reporters
behind
me
not
making
so
much
as
the
scratch
of
a
pen
he
looked
gray
and
pinched
his
eyes
burnt
out
like
a
person
s
who
hasn
t
slept
for
nights
you
could
see
he
was
nervous
for
he
kept
crossing
and
uncrossing
his
knees
and
he
didn
t
give
his
evidence
nearly
so
clear
and
continued
as
the
newspapers
had
it
he
d
stop
every
now
and
then
as
if
he
didn
t
remember
or
as
if
he
was
thinking
of
the
best
way
to
express
himself
he
began
by
telling
how
he
and
sylvia
had
arranged
to
go
in
his
car
to
bloomington
and
there
be
married
by
his
friend
fiske
an
episcopal
clergyman
the
coroner
asked
him
if
fiske
expected
them
and
he
said
no
he
hadn
t
had
time
to
let
him
know
as
the
elopement
was
decided
on
hurriedly
why
was
the
decision
hurried
the
coroner
asked
and
he
answered
low
as
if
he
was
reluctant
to
say
it
because
miss
hesketh
had
a
violent
quarrel
with
her
stepfather
on
saturday
morning
it
was
not
till
after
that
that
she
made
up
her
mind
she
would
go
with
me
did
you
know
at
the
time
what
that
quarrel
was
about
his
face
got
a
dull
red
and
he
said
low
yes
she
told
me
of
it
in
a
letter
she
wrote
me
immediately
afterward
then
he
told
how
on
saturday
night
he
had
received
a
special
delivery
letter
from
her
telling
of
the
quarrel
and
agreeing
to
the
elopement
that
letter
he
had
destroyed
he
answered
it
the
next
morning
she
having
directed
him
to
bring
it
in
himself
and
deliver
it
to
virginie
who
would
meet
him
opposite
corwin
s
drugstore
this
he
did
the
letter
being
the
one
already
in
evidence
the
coroner
asked
him
to
explain
the
sentence
which
said
don
t
disappoint
t
do
what
you
did
the
other
time
he
looked
straight
in
front
of
him
and
answered
we
had
made
a
plan
to
elope
once
before
and
she
had
backed
out
do
you
know
why
it
was
unconventional
when
it
came
to
the
scandal
of
an
elopement
she
hung
back
is
it
your
opinion
that
the
quarrel
with
fowler
made
her
agree
the
second
time
i
know
nothing
about
that
then
he
told
of
leaving
firehill
coming
into
longwood
and
going
down
maple
lane
i
reached
there
a
few
minutes
before
seven
and
ran
down
to
the
pine
tree
where
i
was
to
meet
her
i
drew
up
to
one
side
of
the
road
and
waited
during
the
time
i
an
neither
saw
nor
heard
anybody
at
seven
i
decided
she
had
changed
her
mind
again
and
left
you
didn
t
go
to
the
house
was
not
welcome
at
the
house
she
had
told
me
not
to
go
there
you
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
her
somewhere
else
though
his
face
got
red
again
and
you
could
see
he
had
to
make
an
effort
not
to
get
angry
after
i
had
heard
from
miss
hesketh
and
seen
from
fowler
s
manner
that
i
was
not
wanted
at
mapleshade
i
saw
her
at
intervals
once
or
twice
we
went
for
walks
in
the
woods
and
a
few
times
perhaps
three
or
four
i
met
her
on
the
turnpike
and
took
her
for
a
drive
in
my
car
he
then
went
on
to
tell
how
he
drove
back
to
firehill
reaching
there
a
little
after
nine
the
place
was
empty
and
he
went
up
to
his
room
he
didn
t
know
how
long
he
d
been
there
when
the
telephone
rang
it
was
the
mysterious
message
from
her
he
repeated
it
slowly
evidently
trying
to
give
it
word
for
word
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
when
he
ended
did
you
attempt
to
question
her
on
the
phone
no
it
all
went
too
quick
and
i
was
too
astonished
did
you
get
the
impression
that
she
was
in
any
grave
danger
no
i
never
thought
of
that
she
was
very
rash
and
impulsive
and
i
thought
she
d
done
some
foolhardy
thing
and
had
turned
to
me
as
the
one
person
on
whom
she
could
rely
what
do
you
mean
by
foolhardy
he
gave
a
shrug
and
threw
out
his
hands
the
sort
of
thing
a
child
might
silly
thoughtless
action
she
was
full
of
spirit
and
daring
you
never
could
be
sure
of
what
she
mightn
t
try
i
didn
t
think
of
any
definite
thing
i
ran
to
the
garage
and
got
out
my
car
and
went
northward
up
the
firehill
road
it
was
terrible
traveling
and
i
should
say
it
took
me
nearly
of
an
hour
to
make
the
distance
when
i
was
nearing
the
pike
i
sounded
my
horn
to
let
her
know
i
was
coming
just
before
i
got
there
the
clouds
had
broken
and
the
moon
come
out
the
whole
landscape
was
flooded
with
light
and
i
made
no
doubt
i
d
see
her
as
soon
as
i
turned
into
the
pike
but
she
wasn
t
there
i
slowed
up
and
waited
looking
up
and
down
for
i
d
no
idea
which
way
she
was
coming
but
there
wasn
t
a
sign
of
her
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
road
was
lifeless
and
deserted
then
i
ran
up
and
mile
or
two
either
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
did
you
hear
any
sounds
in
the
breaking
of
twigs
i
heard
nothing
the
place
was
as
still
as
the
grave
i
made
longer
runs
up
and
down
looking
along
both
sides
and
now
and
then
waiting
and
sounding
the
auto
horn
did
you
stop
at
any
of
the
farms
or
cottages
and
make
inquiries
no
i
didn
t
do
that
because
i
had
no
thought
of
her
being
in
any
real
danger
and
because
she
d
cautioned
me
against
letting
anyone
know
after
i
d
searched
the
main
road
thoroughly
for
several
miles
and
gone
up
several
branch
roads
i
began
to
think
she
d
played
a
joke
on
me
do
you
mean
fooled
you
whole
thing
began
to
look
that
way
her
not
being
at
the
rendezvous
in
maple
lane
and
then
phoning
me
to
meet
her
at
a
place
which
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
it
was
nearly
impossible
for
her
to
reach
in
that
space
of
time
it
seemed
the
only
reasonable
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
might
do
when
i
got
the
idea
in
my
head
it
grew
and
he
looked
down
on
the
floor
his
voice
dropping
low
as
if
it
was
hard
for
him
to
speak
i
got
blazing
mad
for
a
moment
it
seemed
like
he
couldn
t
go
on
in
that
moment
i
thought
of
how
he
must
be
feeling
remembering
his
rage
against
her
while
all
the
time
she
was
lying
cold
and
dead
by
the
road
i
was
too
angry
to
go
home
he
went
on
and
not
thinking
much
what
i
did
i
let
the
car
out
and
went
up
and
don
t
know
how
don
t
and
miles
according
to
casey
it
was
four
when
you
came
back
to
the
garage
i
daresay
i
didn
t
notice
the
time
you
were
from
to
on
the
road
yes
you
spent
those
seven
hours
going
up
and
down
the
turnpike
and
the
intersecting
roads
yes
but
at
first
i
half
hours
at
a
time
in
different
places
he
looked
straight
at
the
coroner
as
he
said
that
a
deep
steady
look
more
quiet
and
intent
than
he
d
done
since
he
started
i
think
it
would
have
seemed
to
most
people
as
if
he
was
telling
the
absolute
truth
and
wanted
to
impress
it
but
when
a
girl
feels
about
a
man
as
i
did
about
him
she
can
see
below
the
surface
and
there
was
something
about
the
expression
of
his
face
about
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
made
me
think
for
the
first
time
he
was
holding
something
back
then
he
went
on
and
told
about
going
home
and
falling
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
about
the
doctor
and
mills
coming
when
i
saw
the
doctor
my
first
thought
was
that
i
must
keep
quiet
till
i
found
out
what
had
happened
when
he
asked
me
where
his
daughter
was
i
was
startled
as
i
realized
she
wasn
t
at
home
but
even
then
i
hadn
t
any
idea
of
serious
trouble
and
i
was
determined
to
hold
my
tongue
till
i
knew
more
than
i
did
the
ring
of
the
telephone
gave
me
a
shock
i
had
been
expecting
to
get
a
call
from
her
and
instinctively
i
gave
a
jump
for
it
by
that
time
i
was
sure
she
d
got
into
some
silly
scrape
and
i
wasn
t
going
to
have
her
stepfather
finding
out
and
starting
another
quarrel
they
he
nodded
his
head
at
the
doctor
and
mills
caught
on
at
once
and
made
a
rush
for
me
after
he
lifted
his
hands
and
let
them
drop
on
his
it
was
just
as
they
ve
said
i
was
paralyzed
i
don
t
know
what
i
said
i
only
felt
she
d
been
in
danger
and
called
on
me
and
i
d
failed
her
i
think
for
a
few
moments
i
was
crazy
his
voice
got
so
husky
he
could
hardly
speak
and
he
bent
his
head
down
looking
at
his
hands
i
guess
every
face
in
the
room
was
turned
to
him
but
mine
i
couldn
t
look
at
him
but
sat
like
a
dummy
picking
at
my
gloves
and
inside
in
my
heart
i
felt
like
i
was
crying
in
the
silence
i
heard
one
of
the
reporters
whisper
chap
that
s
tough
he
was
asked
some
more
questions
principally
about
what
sylvia
had
told
him
of
the
quarrels
with
her
stepfather
you
could
see
he
was
careful
in
his
answers
according
to
what
he
said
she
d
only
alluded
to
them
in
a
general
way
as
making
the
life
at
mapleshade
very
uncomfortable
he
was
just
getting
up
when
i
saw
one
of
the
jurors
pass
a
slip
of
paper
across
the
table
to
the
coroner
he
looked
at
it
then
as
reddy
was
moving
away
asked
him
to
wait
a
minute
there
was
another
he
stopped
anywhere
during
sunday
night
to
get
gasoline
for
his
car
reddy
turned
back
and
said
very
simply
no
i
had
an
extra
drum
in
the
car
you
used
that
yes
what
did
you
do
with
the
drum
threw
it
into
the
bushes
somewhere
along
the
road
do
you
know
the
place
he
gave
a
sort
of
smile
and
shook
his
head
no
i
don
t
remember
i
don
t
know
where
i
filled
the
tank
when
it
was
done
i
pitched
the
drum
back
into
the
along
the
turnpike
several
more
of
us
came
after
that
i
among
them
but
the
real
sensation
of
the
day
was
the
doctor
s
evidence
which
i
ll
keep
for
the
next
chapter
vii
the
doctor
was
as
calm
and
as
if
he
were
giving
a
lecture
to
a
class
of
students
he
looked
much
better
than
he
did
that
morning
in
the
exchange
rested
and
with
a
good
color
as
he
settled
himself
in
the
chair
i
heard
one
of
the
reporters
whisper
i
wouldn
t
call
that
the
mug
of
a
murderer
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
right
at
the
one
who
had
spoken
a
young
chap
with
a
round
rosy
innocent
sort
of
face
like
a
kid
s
and
yellow
hair
standing
up
over
his
head
as
thick
as
sheep
s
wool
i
d
seen
him
several
times
in
the
exchange
and
knew
his
name
was
babbitts
and
that
the
other
fellows
called
him
soapy
when
he
caught
my
eye
he
winked
and
you
couldn
t
be
mad
because
it
was
like
a
big
pink
baby
winking
at
you
the
doctor
told
his
story
more
straight
and
continuous
than
any
of
the
others
it
went
along
so
clear
from
point
to
point
that
the
coroner
didn
t
have
to
ask
so
many
questions
and
when
he
did
the
doctor
was
always
ready
with
his
answer
it
sounded
to
me
as
if
he
d
thought
out
every
detail
worked
it
up
just
right
to
get
the
best
effect
he
began
with
saturday
morning
when
he
d
got
the
call
to
go
to
the
dalzells
an
operation
was
performed
early
that
afternoon
and
i
stayed
during
the
night
and
all
the
next
day
going
out
on
sunday
morning
at
ten
for
an
hour
s
ride
in
my
motor
i
had
decided
to
remain
sunday
night
the
patient
was
out
of
at
about
eight
i
received
a
telephone
message
from
my
wife
saying
miss
hesketh
had
run
away
with
jack
reddy
hearing
from
her
that
their
route
would
be
by
the
turnpike
to
bloomington
i
made
up
my
mind
that
my
best
course
was
to
strike
the
turnpike
and
intercept
them
you
disapproved
of
their
marriage
decidedly
miss
hesketh
was
too
young
to
know
her
own
mind
reddy
was
not
the
husband
i
would
have
chosen
for
to
mention
the
distress
it
would
have
caused
fowler
to
have
her
daughter
marry
in
that
manner
my
desire
to
keep
the
escapade
secret
made
me
tell
dalzell
a
i
was
called
away
on
an
important
case
the
dalzells
chauffeur
told
me
that
the
road
from
their
place
to
the
turnpike
was
impassable
for
motors
the
best
route
for
me
would
be
to
go
to
the
junction
where
i
could
strike
the
riven
rock
road
which
came
out
on
the
turnpike
about
a
mile
from
cresset
s
crossing
i
had
plenty
of
time
as
the
distance
young
reddy
would
have
to
travel
before
he
reached
that
point
was
nearly
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
i
arrived
at
the
junction
as
the
train
for
philadelphia
was
drawing
out
i
spoke
to
clark
the
station
agent
about
the
road
and
after
getting
the
directions
walked
round
the
depot
to
the
back
platform
where
my
car
stood
as
i
passed
the
door
of
the
it
suddenly
opened
and
a
woman
came
out
he
for
a
if
to
let
the
people
get
the
effect
of
his
words
a
rustle
went
over
the
room
but
he
looked
as
if
he
didn
t
notice
it
and
went
on
as
calm
and
natural
as
if
he
was
telling
us
a
fiction
story
i
probably
wouldn
t
have
noticed
her
if
she
hadn
t
given
a
suppressed
cry
and
cowered
back
in
the
doorway
that
made
me
look
at
her
and
to
my
amazement
i
saw
it
was
miss
hesketh
s
maid
virginie
dupont
nobody
expected
it
if
he
d
wanted
to
spring
a
sensation
he
d
done
it
we
were
all
leaning
forward
with
our
mouths
open
the
moment
i
saw
her
i
remembered
that
my
wife
had
told
me
the
woman
had
gone
with
miss
hesketh
one
glance
into
the
told
me
she
was
alone
and
i
turned
on
her
and
told
her
i
knew
of
the
elopement
and
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
there
she
was
evidently
terrified
by
my
unexpected
appearance
but
seeing
she
was
caught
she
confessed
that
she
knew
all
about
it
in
fact
that
she
had
been
instructed
by
miss
hesketh
to
go
to
philadelphia
by
the
branch
line
take
a
room
in
the
and
wait
there
till
her
mistress
appeared
i
was
enraged
and
let
her
see
it
pushing
her
round
to
the
car
and
ordering
her
into
the
back
seat
i
vaguely
noticed
that
she
carried
a
bag
and
wrap
over
her
arm
she
tried
to
excuse
herself
but
i
shut
her
up
and
took
my
seat
at
the
wheel
there
was
no
one
on
the
platform
as
we
went
out
it
took
me
over
an
hour
to
negotiate
the
distance
between
the
junction
and
the
turnpike
the
road
was
in
a
fearful
condition
we
ran
into
chuck
holes
and
through
water
nearly
to
the
hubs
once
the
right
front
wheel
dropping
into
a
washout
the
lamp
struck
a
stump
and
was
so
shattered
it
had
to
be
put
out
my
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
path
especially
after
we
left
the
open
country
and
entered
a
thick
wood
where
with
one
lamp
out
of
commission
i
had
to
almost
feel
my
way
i
said
not
a
word
to
the
woman
nor
she
to
me
it
was
not
till
i
was
once
again
in
the
open
that
i
turned
to
speak
to
her
and
saw
she
was
gone
gone
said
one
of
the
bearded
old
man
like
a
interested
he
spoke
right
out
yes
gone
i
guessed
in
a
moment
what
she
had
done
either
when
i
had
stopped
to
put
out
the
lamp
or
in
one
of
the
pauses
while
i
was
feeling
my
way
through
the
wood
she
had
slipped
out
and
run
it
would
have
been
easy
for
her
to
hide
in
the
dark
of
the
trees
i
glanced
into
the
tonneau
and
saw
that
the
things
she
had
carried
the
bag
and
the
wrap
were
also
missing
she
had
been
frightened
and
made
her
escape
unfortunately
in
the
shock
and
horror
of
the
next
day
the
whole
matter
slipped
my
mind
and
she
had
time
to
complete
her
getaway
probably
by
the
branch
line
early
sunday
morning
the
coroner
here
explained
that
inquiries
had
since
been
made
at
the
branch
line
stations
for
the
woman
but
nobody
had
been
found
who
had
seen
her
i
had
no
time
to
go
back
and
look
for
her
and
anyway
it
would
have
been
useless
as
she
could
have
hidden
from
a
sheriff
s
posse
in
the
wood
besides
my
whole
interest
was
focused
on
reaching
the
turnpike
i
could
see
it
before
me
a
long
winding
line
between
the
dark
edges
of
small
trees
i
turned
into
it
and
let
the
car
out
though
the
road
has
many
turns
i
could
have
seen
the
lamps
of
a
motor
some
distance
ahead
and
i
ran
fast
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
but
watching
for
approaching
lights
on
my
ride
back
i
met
only
a
few
vehicles
several
farmers
wagons
and
the
car
of
pease
the
longwood
practitioner
i
reached
home
about
two
and
went
at
once
to
my
wife
s
room
she
was
in
a
hysterical
state
and
i
stayed
with
her
an
hour
or
so
trying
to
quiet
her
when
she
was
better
i
retired
to
my
own
apartment
and
at
seven
called
up
walter
mills
a
detective
in
new
york
telling
him
to
come
to
longwood
as
soon
as
he
could
by
this
time
i
was
uneasy
not
that
i
had
any
suspicion
of
a
real
tragedy
but
the
disappearance
of
miss
hesketh
alarmed
me
i
met
mills
at
the
train
and
told
him
the
situation
and
that
i
intended
telephoning
to
fiske
at
bloomington
thinking
they
might
have
reached
there
by
some
other
way
it
was
his
suggestion
that
before
any
step
was
taken
which
might
make
the
matter
public
it
would
be
well
to
communicate
with
firehill
and
see
if
the
servants
knew
anything
i
did
this
and
to
my
amazement
learned
that
reddy
was
there
that
is
all
of
the
doctor
s
testimony
that
i
need
put
down
as
the
rest
of
it
you
know
it
left
us
in
a
sort
of
surprise
no
one
could
have
told
it
better
no
one
could
have
been
more
sure
about
it
or
more
quiet
and
natural
seems
like
i
ought
to
write
that
word
in
the
biggest
letters
to
give
the
idea
of
how
it
stood
out
in
my
mind
of
all
the
stories
it
was
the
strangest
and
it
was
so
pat
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
about
it
reading
it
as
i
ve
written
it
here
but
i
can
say
for
myself
listening
and
watching
that
man
tell
it
i
couldn
t
seem
to
believe
it
it
was
near
to
evening
the
room
getting
dusk
and
the
fire
showing
up
large
and
bright
when
the
jury
brought
in
their
verdict
the
deceased
met
her
death
at
the
hands
of
a
person
or
persons
unknown
i
walked
back
up
maple
lane
the
night
was
setting
in
cold
and
frosty
the
clouds
had
drawn
off
the
air
was
clear
as
crystal
and
full
of
the
sounds
of
motor
horns
big
and
little
cars
passed
me
jouncing
over
the
ruts
and
swinging
round
the
bend
where
the
pine
stood
i
was
looking
up
at
it
black
like
a
skeleton
against
the
glow
in
the
west
when
a
step
came
up
behind
me
and
a
voice
said
you
re
a
good
witness
miss
morganthau
it
was
that
fresh
kid
babbitts
and
i
wasn
t
sorry
to
have
him
join
me
as
i
was
feeling
as
if
i
d
been
sitting
in
a
tomb
he
was
serious
too
not
a
wink
about
him
now
his
eyes
on
the
ground
his
hands
dug
down
in
the
pockets
of
his
overcoat
a
strange
case
isn
t
it
he
said
awful
strange
i
answered
if
it
wasn
t
for
your
story
of
that
man
on
the
phone
i
think
they
d
arrest
fowler
didn
t
you
believe
what
he
said
i
wasn
t
going
to
give
away
my
thoughts
any
more
than
i
d
been
willing
to
give
away
what
i
heard
on
the
wire
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
the
same
for
he
answered
slow
and
thoughtful
i
m
not
saying
what
i
believe
or
don
t
believe
or
maybe
it
s
better
if
i
say
i
m
not
ready
yet
to
believe
or
disbelieve
anything
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
red
behind
the
trees
and
spoke
easy
and
careless
they
say
miss
hesketh
had
a
good
many
admirers
do
they
was
all
he
got
out
of
me
that
made
him
laugh
jolly
and
boyish
oh
you
needn
t
keep
your
guard
up
now
your
stuff
ll
be
in
the
papers
and
take
it
from
me
that
fellow
that
sent
the
message
is
going
to
get
a
jar
the
man
i
listened
to
sure
he
hasn
t
got
the
ghost
of
an
idea
anyone
overheard
him
can
t
you
imagine
how
he
ll
feel
when
he
opens
his
paper
and
sees
that
a
smart
little
hello
girl
was
tapping
the
wire
it
s
funny
but
i
d
never
thought
of
it
that
way
why
he
d
get
a
shock
like
dynamite
it
got
hold
of
me
so
that
i
didn
t
speak
for
a
spell
thinking
of
that
man
reading
his
paper
his
coffee
or
maybe
going
down
in
the
suddenly
seeing
printed
out
in
black
and
white
what
he
thought
no
one
in
the
world
knew
except
himself
and
that
poor
dead
girl
babbitts
went
on
talking
me
listening
with
one
comes
natural
to
an
operator
we
ve
been
rounding
up
all
the
men
that
were
after
that
they
were
backward
with
their
too
glad
to
be
of
service
thank
you
carisbrook
was
at
aiken
a
lawyer
named
dunham
was
up
state
trying
a
case
robinson
a
chap
in
a
bank
was
spending
the
on
long
island
there
was
only
one
of
them
near
named
cokesbury
do
you
know
him
both
my
ears
got
busy
cokesbury
i
said
sort
of
startled
was
cokesbury
at
the
lodge
last
week
he
was
and
i
know
just
what
he
did
what
did
he
do
he
laughed
out
as
gay
as
you
please
for
he
saw
he
d
got
me
just
where
he
wanted
when
i
ve
tried
to
find
out
things
from
you
you
ve
turned
me
down
aw
go
on
i
said
coaxing
don
t
you
know
by
experience
i
m
no
talking
machine
to
give
out
every
word
that
s
said
to
me
i
believe
you
he
answered
and
it
ll
be
good
for
your
character
for
me
to
set
a
generous
example
cokesbury
was
at
the
lodge
from
last
saturday
on
the
train
to
last
monday
on
the
gee
i
said
soft
to
myself
you
can
quell
those
rising
hopes
he
replied
he
wasn
t
the
man
you
heard
how
do
you
know
because
hearing
that
he
was
a
friend
of
miss
hesketh
s
i
spent
part
of
yesterday
at
azalea
and
found
that
cokesbury
can
prove
as
good
an
alibi
as
any
of
them
did
you
see
him
no
he
wasn
t
there
and
if
he
had
been
i
wouldn
t
have
bothered
with
him
i
saw
someone
much
the
man
who
owns
the
azalea
garage
where
cokesbury
puts
up
his
car
it
appears
that
the
trip
before
last
cokesbury
broke
his
axle
and
had
to
have
his
car
towed
down
to
the
garage
and
left
there
to
be
mended
when
he
came
down
saturday
he
expected
it
to
be
done
and
when
it
wasn
t
got
in
a
rage
and
raised
the
devil
of
a
row
he
had
to
go
out
to
his
place
in
one
of
miner
s
cars
which
left
him
there
and
went
back
for
him
monday
morning
then
he
had
no
auto
on
sunday
miss
morganthau
will
take
the
head
of
the
class
then
he
said
low
as
if
to
someone
beside
him
she
s
our
prize
pupil
but
we
don
t
say
it
before
her
face
for
fear
of
making
her
proud
then
back
to
me
as
solemn
as
a
priest
in
the
pulpit
that
is
the
situation
reduced
to
its
lowest
had
no
car
well
that
ends
i
said
so
it
seems
to
me
in
fact
cokesbury
gets
the
gate
i
won
t
hide
from
you
now
that
i
went
to
azalea
because
i
d
heard
a
rumor
of
that
talk
on
the
phone
and
thought
i
d
do
a
little
private
sleuthing
on
my
own
didn
t
know
but
what
i
was
destined
to
be
the
baby
grand
burns
and
nothing
s
come
of
it
nothing
except
that
it
drops
cokesbury
out
with
a
thud
that
s
dull
and
sickening
for
me
but
you
can
bet
your
best
hat
it
s
just
the
opposite
for
him
well
i
guess
yes
i
said
and
walked
along
wondering
to
myself
whose
voice
that
have
been
viii
after
the
inquest
there
was
no
more
question
about
who
was
suspected
it
was
as
if
every
finger
in
longwood
was
raised
and
pointed
to
mapleshade
the
cautious
people
didn
t
say
it
the
who
were
afraid
of
losing
those
who
had
nothing
to
gain
by
keeping
still
came
out
with
it
flatfooted
it
wasn
t
only
that
nobody
liked
the
doctor
or
believed
his
story
it
was
because
the
people
were
wild
at
what
had
been
done
they
wanted
to
find
the
murderer
and
put
him
behind
bars
and
seeing
that
things
pointed
more
clearly
to
fowler
than
to
anybody
else
they
pitched
on
him
all
the
gossip
about
the
quarreling
came
out
blacker
than
ever
the
papers
were
full
of
it
and
the
other
worse
stories
about
sylvia
s
allowance
and
the
will
of
her
father
there
wasn
t
a
bit
of
dirty
linen
in
the
fowler
household
that
wasn
t
washed
and
hung
out
on
the
line
for
the
public
to
gape
at
and
some
of
it
was
dirtier
when
they
d
got
through
washing
than
it
had
been
before
there
were
those
who
didn
t
scruple
to
say
that
the
whole
tragedy
was
a
between
virginie
dupont
and
the
doctor
if
you
talked
sensible
to
them
and
asked
them
how
virginie
could
have
got
word
to
him
that
sylvia
was
running
away
they
d
just
push
that
to
one
side
saying
it
could
be
explained
some
way
everything
wasn
t
known
one
thing
you
be
sure
one
person
who
knew
the
whereabouts
of
that
french
woman
was
daniel
fowler
i
believe
there
were
some
days
after
the
inquest
when
if
there
d
been
an
anarchist
or
agitator
to
stand
on
the
postoffice
steps
and
yell
that
fowler
ought
to
be
jailed
a
crowd
would
have
gathered
gone
down
to
mapleshade
and
demanded
him
fortunately
there
was
no
one
of
that
kind
around
and
he
stayed
quiet
in
his
home
not
even
coming
to
the
village
two
days
after
the
inquest
i
saw
anne
and
she
said
he
and
fowler
hadn
t
been
out
of
the
they
were
in
a
state
of
siege
what
with
reporters
and
the
police
and
morbid
cranks
who
hung
round
the
grounds
looking
up
at
the
windows
that
same
evening
i
stayed
over
time
in
the
exchange
lending
a
hand
the
work
was
something
awful
and
katie
reilly
the
new
girl
was
most
snowed
under
and
on
the
way
to
lose
her
head
i
wanted
to
see
her
through
and
i
wanted
the
credit
of
the
office
kept
up
but
it
s
also
true
that
i
wanted
to
be
on
the
job
myself
and
hear
all
that
was
passing
believe
me
it
was
hard
to
quiet
down
in
my
bedroom
at
night
after
eight
hours
at
the
switchboard
right
in
the
thick
of
the
excitement
besides
i
d
got
to
know
the
reporters
pretty
well
and
it
was
fun
making
them
think
i
could
give
them
leads
and
then
guying
them
i
liked
babbitts
the
best
but
there
were
three
others
that
weren
t
bad
as
men
go
one
was
jones
a
tall
thin
chap
like
an
actor
with
long
black
hair
hanging
down
to
his
collar
and
freddy
jasper
who
was
english
and
talked
with
an
awful
swell
dialect
and
a
guy
called
yerrington
who
belonged
on
a
paper
as
yellow
as
his
face
and
always
went
round
with
a
cigarette
hanging
from
his
lip
like
it
was
stuck
on
with
glue
it
was
nearly
eight
and
work
was
slacking
off
when
i
started
to
go
home
what
with
the
jump
i
d
been
on
and
listening
to
the
gabbing
round
the
door
i
d
forgotten
my
supper
it
wasn
t
till
i
saw
the
gilt
edge
window
with
a
nice
pile
of
apples
stacked
up
round
a
pumpkin
that
i
remembered
i
was
hungry
and
walked
over
there
were
only
three
people
in
the
place
florrie
stein
the
waitress
and
a
woman
with
a
kid
in
the
corner
i
was
just
finishing
my
corn
beef
hash
with
a
cup
of
coffee
at
my
elbow
and
stewed
prunes
on
the
line
of
promotion
when
soapy
and
jones
and
jasper
came
in
and
asked
me
if
they
could
sit
at
my
table
please
yourself
said
i
and
you
ll
please
me
for
politeness
is
one
of
the
things
i
was
bred
up
to
and
they
sat
down
calling
out
their
orders
to
florrie
stein
they
naturally
began
talking
about
the
case
was
all
anybody
talked
about
just
for
all
i
knew
so
much
about
it
i
generally
picked
up
some
new
bits
from
them
so
i
went
to
the
extravagance
of
three
cents
worth
of
jelly
roll
not
because
i
wanted
it
but
because
i
could
crumb
it
up
and
eat
it
slow
and
not
give
away
i
was
sitting
on
to
listen
we
can
talk
before
you
miss
morganthau
said
babbitts
because
while
we
all
agree
you
re
the
belle
of
longwood
we
ve
found
out
by
sad
experience
you
re
a
belle
without
a
tongue
florrie
stein
bringing
the
food
then
they
were
silent
till
she
d
set
it
out
and
when
she
d
drawn
off
to
the
cashier
s
desk
they
started
in
again
they
were
so
to
speak
looking
over
hines
as
a
suspect
no
hines
won
t
fit
said
babbitts
the
presence
of
the
jewelry
on
the
body
eliminates
him
they
ve
dug
up
his
record
and
though
the
place
he
ran
wasn
t
to
be
recommended
for
sunday
school
picnics
the
man
himself
seems
to
have
been
fairly
decent
it
s
odd
about
the
fitted
bag
and
the
jewelry
gone
from
the
room
said
jasper
the
police
have
an
idea
that
virginie
dupont
could
tell
something
of
them
theft
theft
on
the
side
oh
pshaw
said
jones
what
s
the
good
of
complicating
things
if
theft
was
committed
it
was
a
part
of
a
plot
you
believe
in
this
idea
they
ve
got
in
the
village
that
fowler
and
the
french
woman
worked
together
i
my
mind
the
murderer
s
marked
as
plain
as
cain
after
he
was
branded
on
the
brow
or
wherever
it
was
then
jasper
spoke
up
he
s
a
nice
quiet
chap
not
as
fresh
as
the
others
let
s
hear
what
you
base
that
assertion
on
jones
forgot
his
supper
and
twisted
round
sideways
in
his
chair
looking
thoughtful
up
at
the
cornice
as
i
understand
it
in
a
murder
two
things
are
crime
and
a
corpse
and
in
a
murderer
one
a
motive
now
we
have
all
motive
especially
strong
if
miss
hesketh
married
her
stepfather
lost
his
home
and
the
money
he
had
been
living
on
so
he
tried
to
stop
her
from
marrying
saturday
night
he
heard
that
his
efforts
had
failed
i
fancy
that
on
sunday
morning
when
he
went
for
that
auto
drive
he
stopped
at
some
as
yet
communicated
with
virginie
dupont
who
was
in
his
pay
she
too
went
out
that
morning
you
may
remember
there
s
a
good
deal
of
surmise
about
this
said
babbitts
jones
gave
him
a
scornful
look
if
the
links
in
the
chain
were
perfect
fowler
d
be
eating
his
dinner
in
bloomington
jail
how
do
you
account
for
miss
it
was
on
the
train
instead
of
the
turnpike
said
jasper
a
change
of
plans
jones
answered
calmly
also
not
yet
satisfactorily
cleared
up
to
continue
sometime
on
sunday
the
doctor
conceived
the
plan
of
ridding
himself
of
all
his
troublesome
stepdaughter
the
disturbance
of
his
home
and
his
financial
distress
he
turned
and
looked
solemnly
at
us
fate
played
so
well
into
his
hands
i
can
t
yet
main
point
is
that
it
did
he
met
miss
hesketh
at
the
junction
either
by
threats
persuasion
or
coercion
made
her
enter
his
auto
and
carried
her
up
the
road
to
the
turnpike
and
now
said
babbitts
leaning
his
arms
on
the
table
we
come
to
her
appearance
in
the
wayside
arbor
we
do
jones
replied
nodding
his
head
you
may
remember
that
both
hines
and
his
servant
said
there
were
twigs
and
leaves
on
the
edge
of
her
skirt
and
that
her
boots
were
muddy
traces
of
this
were
still
visible
in
her
clothes
when
they
found
her
body
she
get
out
of
the
automobile
but
not
so
far
from
the
turnpike
as
he
said
either
he
and
she
had
some
fierce
quarrel
and
she
ran
from
him
in
rage
or
terror
or
he
may
have
told
the
truth
and
she
slipped
out
at
the
turn
from
the
riven
rock
road
without
his
knowledge
anyway
she
got
away
from
him
and
ran
for
the
only
light
she
saw
there
she
telephoned
reddy
withholding
the
main
facts
from
him
perhaps
merely
to
save
time
but
cautioning
him
against
letting
anyone
know
of
the
message
that
as
i
see
it
was
a
natural
feminine
desire
to
guard
against
gossip
when
she
thought
reddy
was
due
she
started
out
to
meet
instead
met
the
doctor
who
d
been
hanging
about
for
a
on
the
roadside
precisely
he
killed
her
concealed
the
body
and
went
home
just
a
minute
said
what
did
he
kill
her
with
the
weapon
used
is
a
disputed
point
many
think
it
was
a
farm
implement
did
he
go
across
lots
to
cresset
s
and
arm
himself
with
a
convenient
spade
or
rake
for
the
fatherly
purpose
of
slaying
his
stepdaughter
but
you
couldn
t
phase
jones
he
said
as
calm
as
a
may
morning
he
have
done
that
but
i
don
t
think
he
did
he
didn
t
need
it
the
tool
box
of
the
car
was
nearer
to
hand
a
auto
wrench
is
a
pretty
formidable
weapon
and
a
tire
you
ever
see
one
one
blow
of
that
would
crush
in
the
head
of
a
negro
gentlemen
the
evidence
is
all
in
said
babbitts
your
case
might
hold
water
said
jasper
if
it
wasn
t
as
full
of
holes
as
a
sieve
why
you
can
make
out
as
good
a
one
for
almost
anybody
who
for
example
jones
asked
reddy
jack
reddy
i
said
that
sitting
up
suddenly
and
staring
at
them
with
a
piece
of
jelly
roll
halfway
to
my
mouth
he
s
as
good
as
another
said
jasper
and
then
he
added
sort
of
dreamy
i
believe
i
could
work
up
quite
a
convincing
case
against
reddy
allowing
for
a
hole
here
and
there
but
our
illustrious
friend
here
admits
holes
at
this
stage
fire
away
said
babbitts
give
it
to
us
holes
and
all
the
bat
here
it
is
you
may
remember
that
no
one
saw
him
coming
back
from
maple
lane
that
night
there
is
no
one
therefore
to
deny
that
he
may
have
had
miss
hesketh
in
the
car
with
him
instead
of
going
back
to
firehill
as
he
says
he
did
he
followed
his
original
plan
of
taking
her
by
the
turnpike
right
at
the
start
i
challenge
that
said
babbitts
she
appeared
at
the
wayside
arbor
at
the
date
in
maple
lane
was
for
seven
supposing
she
kept
it
and
was
on
is
a
stretch
of
the
would
have
had
to
travel
one
hundred
and
eighteen
miles
in
two
hours
and
a
half
he
could
have
done
it
on
a
black
dark
night
nearly
miles
an
hour
you
forget
he
knew
the
road
and
was
driving
a
racing
car
it
s
improbable
but
not
impossible
i
count
that
as
a
hole
but
go
on
now
in
this
hypothetical
case
we
ll
suppose
that
as
that
car
flew
over
the
miles
the
man
and
the
woman
in
it
had
high
words
hold
on
said
jones
holding
out
his
that
s
too
big
a
hole
they
were
lovers
eloping
not
an
old
married
couple
i
ll
explain
that
later
the
high
words
inflamed
and
enraged
the
man
to
the
point
of
murder
and
he
conceived
a
horrible
plan
as
they
neared
the
wayside
arbor
he
told
the
woman
something
was
wrong
with
the
car
and
sent
her
to
the
place
ostensibly
to
telephone
really
to
establish
her
presence
there
at
a
time
when
had
she
been
with
him
she
could
hardly
have
got
that
far
i
jumped
in
there
i
knew
it
was
only
fooling
but
even
so
i
didn
t
like
hearing
reddy
talked
about
that
way
who
did
he
send
her
to
telephone
to
mr
babbitts
laughed
and
jerked
his
head
toward
me
listen
to
our
little
belle
sounding
the
curfew
on
jasper
but
jasper
was
ready
he
could
have
done
that
knowing
his
house
was
empty
hines
you
remember
said
she
wasn
t
five
minutes
in
the
booth
we
ve
only
reddy
s
word
for
that
message
we
don
t
even
know
if
she
got
a
connection
i
telephoned
out
to
the
corona
operator
saturday
and
she
answered
that
there
was
no
record
of
the
message
and
she
herself
remembered
nothing
about
it
but
sylvia
i
she
told
hines
she
was
expecting
someone
to
come
for
her
sylvia
was
eloping
mightn
t
she
have
told
was
curious
and
wasn
t
true
a
sort
of
hush
fell
on
us
all
babbitts
s
face
and
jones
s
from
being
just
amused
were
intent
and
interested
go
ahead
jasper
said
babbitts
if
this
isn
t
buying
the
baby
a
frock
it
s
good
yarning
jasper
went
on
her
story
of
the
broken
automobile
believed
to
be
true
but
she
didn
t
want
hines
to
know
who
she
was
or
what
she
was
up
to
so
she
invented
the
person
coming
to
take
her
home
why
she
sat
so
long
there
talking
ll
hole
but
i
said
in
the
beginning
there
would
be
some
the
end
is
just
like
the
end
of
jones
s
case
she
went
back
to
reddy
and
he
killed
her
with
as
our
friend
has
suggested
one
of
the
auto
tools
very
soon
after
it
would
have
been
as
that
s
her
name
the
scream
at
that
s
all
very
well
said
jones
but
before
we
go
further
i
d
like
you
to
furnish
us
with
a
motive
nothing
jealousy
i
said
sudden
and
sharp
jealousy
in
its
most
violent
form
the
lady
in
this
case
was
a
peculiar
natural
born
siren
she
had
made
the
man
jealous
furiously
jealous
was
the
reason
of
the
high
words
in
the
motor
who
was
he
jealous
of
it
was
i
again
who
asked
that
jasper
turned
round
and
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
why
miss
morganthau
he
said
gave
us
the
clue
to
that
he
was
jealous
of
the
man
who
made
the
date
you
heard
on
the
phone
don
t
you
see
he
said
turning
to
the
others
man
kept
his
date
and
reddy
came
and
found
him
there
i
can
t
tell
what
it
was
that
fell
on
us
and
made
us
sit
so
still
for
a
minute
all
of
us
knew
it
was
just
a
joke
me
was
as
if
a
cloud
had
settled
on
the
room
babbitts
sat
smoking
a
cigarette
and
staring
at
the
rings
he
was
making
with
his
eyes
screwed
up
presently
when
jones
spoke
his
voice
had
a
sound
like
his
pride
was
taken
down
a
great
deal
better
than
i
expected
but
it
s
simply
riddled
with
holes
before
jasper
could
answer
the
door
opened
and
yerrington
came
in
the
cigarette
was
hanging
off
his
lip
and
as
he
said
good
evening
to
me
it
wobbled
but
clung
on
then
he
pulled
out
a
chair
sat
down
and
looking
at
the
other
three
with
a
gleam
in
his
eye
said
a
little
while
ago
fowler
s
chauffeur
in
dusting
out
his
car
found
the
gold
mesh
purse
squeezed
down
between
the
back
and
the
cushion
ix
the
finding
of
the
gold
purse
established
the
fact
that
part
anyway
of
the
doctor
s
story
was
woman
who
had
gone
down
to
the
junction
and
then
disappeared
disappeared
in
his
auto
was
she
sylvia
hesketh
the
general
verdict
was
hesketh
for
some
unknown
reason
running
away
from
her
lover
and
her
home
all
the
world
knew
now
that
she
was
wild
and
unstable
a
girl
that
might
take
any
whim
into
her
head
and
act
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
there
were
theories
to
burn
why
she
should
have
thrown
down
reddy
and
slipped
away
alone
but
those
that
knew
her
said
she
was
a
law
unto
herself
and
let
it
go
at
that
the
morning
after
that
supper
in
the
gilt
edge
anne
came
in
to
do
the
marketing
and
stopped
at
the
exchange
the
room
was
empty
but
even
so
i
had
to
whisper
are
they
going
to
arrest
the
doctor
he
s
waiting
she
whispered
back
what
do
you
make
of
it
what
i
always
have
i
think
the
woman
was
virginie
i
think
she
took
sylvia
s
things
and
lit
out
on
her
own
account
what
does
fowler
say
she
s
going
to
offer
a
reward
for
the
murderer
that
s
her
way
of
answering
this
last
seems
to
have
roused
her
she
knows
now
it
s
going
to
be
a
fight
for
her
husband
s
liberty
perhaps
his
life
she
s
employing
mills
and
some
other
detectives
and
she
keeps
in
close
touch
with
them
the
next
day
the
reward
was
made
public
it
was
in
all
the
papers
and
nailed
up
at
the
depot
and
in
the
post
office
the
words
printed
in
black
staring
letters
ten
thousand
dollars
reward
to
anyone
discovering
the
murderer
of
the
late
sylvia
hesketh
this
sum
will
be
paid
by
her
mother
constance
grey
fowler
mapleshade
new
jersey
late
that
afternoon
babbitts
came
into
the
office
he
was
staying
at
the
longwood
inn
but
it
was
the
first
time
that
day
i
d
seen
him
and
after
our
supper
together
i
d
begun
to
feel
real
chummy
with
him
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
was
short
and
preoccupied
giving
me
a
number
without
more
words
and
then
banging
shut
the
door
of
the
booth
it
got
me
a
little
riled
and
seeing
he
wasn
t
wasting
any
manners
i
didn
t
see
why
i
should
so
i
lifted
the
cam
and
quietly
listened
in
not
that
i
expected
to
hear
anything
very
private
the
number
he
d
given
was
his
paper
the
chap
at
the
other
end
had
a
way
of
grunting
i
got
you
no
matter
what
was
said
i
d
heard
before
and
he
had
a
most
unnatural
sort
of
patience
about
him
as
if
his
spirit
was
broken
forever
taking
messages
off
a
wire
say
says
babbitts
i
got
a
new
country
near
hines
place
i
been
there
all
morning
there
s
a
farm
up
that
way
cresset
s
spelled
the
name
and
the
other
one
did
his
usual
good
people
years
on
the
soil
stand
high
their
house
is
about
half
a
mile
across
woods
and
fields
from
the
wayside
arbor
lonely
with
a
bad
bit
of
road
leading
up
from
the
pike
do
you
hear
get
on
said
the
voice
i
stopped
in
there
and
had
a
séance
with
cresset
nice
woman
fat
with
a
white
apron
i
said
i
was
a
tourist
thirsting
for
a
drink
of
milk
the
other
one
seemed
to
rouse
up
did
you
thirst
that
bad
for
i
got
it
she
s
been
scared
of
the
notoriety
and
has
held
back
something
which
seems
important
her
husband
s
been
prying
her
up
to
the
point
of
going
to
the
district
attorney
and
she
s
agreed
but
tried
it
on
me
first
do
you
hear
i
got
you
the
night
of
the
murder
about
nine
a
man
knocked
at
her
door
saying
he
d
lost
his
way
and
wanting
to
know
where
he
was
and
how
to
get
to
the
turnpike
she
spoke
to
him
from
an
upper
window
and
couldn
t
see
his
face
the
night
being
dark
all
she
could
make
out
was
that
he
was
large
and
wore
an
overcoat
he
told
her
his
auto
was
in
the
road
back
of
him
and
he
d
got
mixed
up
in
the
country
lanes
the
thing
s
funny
as
there
are
very
few
roads
that
side
of
the
pike
hold
s
that
about
pike
babbitts
repeated
it
and
went
on
doesn
t
appear
to
have
been
in
the
least
sober
and
spoke
like
a
gentleman
she
gave
him
the
direction
and
here
s
what
caught
his
voice
as
very
deep
rich
and
pleasant
almost
the
same
words
the
longwood
telephone
girl
used
to
describe
the
voice
she
overheard
speaking
to
miss
hesketh
saturday
noon
any
more
impossible
to
identify
man
but
says
she
d
know
the
voice
again
he
thanked
her
very
couldn
t
lay
enough
stress
on
how
good
his
manners
she
heard
him
walk
away
splashing
through
the
mud
there
were
a
few
sentences
that
gave
me
time
to
pull
out
a
novel
and
settle
down
over
it
i
seemed
so
buried
in
it
that
when
babbitts
put
down
his
money
i
never
raised
my
eyes
just
swept
the
coin
into
the
drawer
and
turned
a
page
he
didn
t
move
leaning
against
the
switchboard
and
not
saying
a
word
with
him
standing
there
so
close
i
got
nervous
and
had
to
look
up
and
as
soon
as
i
did
it
he
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
for
me
to
lift
my
headpiece
if
two
heads
are
better
than
one
he
said
two
ears
must
be
and
the
words
i
am
about
to
utter
should
be
fully
heard
to
be
appreciated
of
course
i
thought
he
was
going
to
tell
me
what
he
d
found
out
at
cresset
s
it
made
me
feel
proud
being
confided
in
by
a
newspaper
man
and
i
pushed
up
my
headpiece
all
smiling
and
ready
to
be
smart
and
helpful
he
didn
t
smile
back
but
looked
and
spoke
as
solemn
as
an
undertaker
miss
morganthau
yours
is
a
very
sedentary
occupation
believe
me
i
got
a
jolt
if
you
re
asking
me
to
violate
the
rules
for
that
i
answered
you
re
taking
more
upon
yourself
than
i
ll
overlook
from
a
child
reporter
with
a
head
of
hair
like
the
fair
circassian
in
barnum
bailey
s
i
speak
only
as
one
concerned
for
your
health
a
walk
after
business
hours
should
be
the
invariable
practice
of
those
whose
work
forbids
exercise
thank
you
for
your
interest
says
i
very
haughty
but
it
s
well
to
look
at
home
before
we
search
abroad
the
man
who
spends
all
his
time
riding
in
autos
at
the
expense
of
the
press
would
be
better
employed
exercising
his
own
limbs
than
directing
those
of
others
so
start
right
along
and
walk
quick
he
didn
t
budge
but
says
slow
and
thoughtful
your
remarks
miss
morganthau
are
always
to
the
point
i
m
going
to
take
a
walk
this
about
i
hope
you
ll
enjoy
it
says
i
as
for
me
i
m
going
straight
home
to
rest
i
need
it
what
with
my
work
and
the
ginks
that
stand
round
here
taking
up
my
time
and
running
the
risk
of
getting
me
fired
door
handle
clicked
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
saw
a
man
coming
in
which
way
i
says
in
a
whisper
down
maple
lane
he
whispers
back
and
i
was
in
front
of
my
board
with
my
headpiece
in
place
when
the
man
came
in
we
walked
up
and
down
maple
lane
for
an
hour
and
it
may
amuse
you
to
know
that
what
that
simple
guy
wanted
was
to
tell
me
to
listen
to
every
voice
on
my
wires
i
looked
at
him
calm
and
pitiful
that
had
been
listening
till
if
your
ears
grow
with
exercise
mine
ought
to
have
been
long
enough
to
tie
in
a
true
lover
s
knot
on
top
of
my
head
there
s
a
wonderful
innocence
about
men
in
some
ways
it
makes
you
feel
sorry
for
them
like
they
were
helpless
children
then
he
capped
the
climax
by
telling
me
about
cresset
that
t
thought
i
d
heard
a
word
and
as
he
told
it
believing
so
honest
that
i
didn
t
know
i
began
to
feel
kind
of
cheap
as
if
i
d
lied
to
someone
who
couldn
t
have
thought
i
d
do
such
a
thing
i
didn
t
tell
him
the
was
too
i
made
a
vow
no
matter
how
sly
i
was
to
the
others
i
d
be
on
the
square
with
babbitts
and
i
ll
say
right
here
that
i
ve
made
good
resolutions
and
broken
them
but
that
one
i
ve
kept
there
s
a
little
hill
part
way
along
the
lane
where
the
road
slopes
down
toward
the
entrance
of
mapleshade
we
stopped
here
and
looked
back
at
the
house
lying
long
and
dark
among
its
dark
trees
the
sky
was
bright
with
stars
and
by
their
light
you
could
see
the
black
patches
of
the
woods
and
here
and
there
a
paler
stretch
where
the
land
was
bare
and
open
it
was
all
shadowy
and
gloomy
except
where
the
windows
shone
out
in
bright
orange
squares
i
pointed
out
to
babbitts
where
sylvia
s
windows
were
not
a
light
in
them
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
wing
four
or
five
in
a
row
that
belonged
to
fowler
s
suite
her
was
one
of
them
where
anne
had
told
me
she
and
the
doctor
always
sat
in
the
evenings
they
re
there
now
i
said
what
do
you
suppose
they
re
doing
search
me
said
babbitts
i
can
t
answer
for
another
man
but
if
i
was
in
the
doctor
s
shoes
i
d
be
pacing
up
and
down
with
my
circassian
beauty
hair
turning
white
while
you
waited
yes
i
said
nodding
i
ll
bet
that
s
what
he
s
doing
i
can
see
them
surrounded
by
their
riches
jumping
every
time
there
s
a
knock
on
the
door
thinking
that
the
summons
has
come
and
that
shows
you
how
you
never
can
tell
for
at
that
hour
in
that
room
the
doctor
and
fowler
were
talking
to
walter
mills
who
had
just
come
from
philadelphia
bringing
them
the
first
ray
of
hope
they
d
had
since
the
tragedy
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
diamond
and
ruby
lavalliere
that
he
had
found
the
day
before
in
a
pawn
shop
and
that
fowler
had
identified
as
sylvia
s
four
days
later
a
piece
of
news
ran
like
wildfire
through
longwood
virginie
dupont
had
been
arrested
and
brought
to
bloomington
they
put
her
in
jail
there
and
it
didn
t
take
any
third
degree
to
get
the
truth
out
of
her
she
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
for
she
was
caught
with
the
goods
all
the
lost
jewelry
being
found
in
the
place
where
she
was
hiding
it
sent
her
to
the
penitentiary
and
her
lover
too
for
she
said
had
robbed
sylvia
s
hesketh
s
room
on
the
night
that
sylvia
hesketh
disappeared
if
her
story
threw
no
light
on
the
murder
it
exonerated
the
doctor
for
it
fitted
at
every
point
with
what
he
had
said
i
ll
write
it
down
here
not
in
her
words
but
as
i
got
it
from
the
papers
for
some
time
she
had
been
planning
to
rob
sylvia
but
was
waiting
for
a
good
opportunity
this
came
when
the
doctor
being
out
of
the
house
she
discovered
that
an
elopement
was
on
foot
she
had
read
sylvia
s
letters
which
were
thrown
carelessly
about
and
knew
of
the
affair
with
jack
reddy
and
when
on
sunday
morning
she
was
sent
to
the
village
to
get
a
letter
from
reddy
she
guessed
what
it
was
before
giving
it
to
sylvia
she
went
to
her
own
room
opened
the
envelope
with
steam
from
a
kettle
and
read
it
then
she
knew
that
her
chance
had
come
when
evening
drew
on
she
hung
about
the
halls
and
saw
sylvia
leave
at
a
few
minutes
past
six
carrying
the
fitted
bag
the
coast
being
clear
she
went
to
her
room
took
an
old
black
bag
of
her
own
and
stole
back
it
was
while
she
was
getting
this
bag
that
the
idea
came
to
her
of
impersonating
her
mistress
as
in
that
way
she
could
steal
some
clothes
she
secured
the
jewelry
in
a
pocket
hanging
from
her
waist
took
some
false
hair
that
sylvia
wore
when
the
weather
was
damp
and
covered
her
head
with
it
and
selected
a
little
automobile
hat
of
which
there
were
several
over
all
tying
a
figured
black
lace
veil
what
she
particularly
wanted
was
a
new
hudson
seal
coat
that
had
been
delivered
a
few
days
before
no
one
but
herself
and
miss
hesketh
knew
of
this
coat
as
there
had
been
so
much
quarreling
about
sylvia
s
extravagance
that
the
girl
often
bought
clothes
without
telling
after
putting
it
on
she
filled
her
bag
with
things
from
the
bureau
drawers
and
just
as
she
was
leaving
saw
the
gold
mesh
purse
on
the
dresser
and
snatched
it
up
all
this
was
done
like
lightning
and
she
thinks
she
left
the
house
not
more
than
twenty
or
minutes
after
sylvia
to
catch
the
train
she
had
to
hurry
and
she
ran
up
maple
lane
behind
the
hedge
she
was
nearing
the
village
when
she
heard
the
whirr
of
an
auto
and
through
the
hedge
saw
the
two
big
headlights
of
a
car
coming
slowly
down
the
lane
for
a
moment
she
paused
peeking
through
the
branches
and
made
out
that
there
was
only
one
person
in
it
jack
reddy
she
reached
the
station
only
a
few
minutes
before
the
train
came
in
as
she
had
a
ticket
she
stood
at
the
dark
end
of
the
platform
not
moving
into
the
light
till
the
engine
was
drawing
near
then
jim
donahue
saw
her
and
came
up
addressing
her
as
miss
hesketh
she
had
often
tried
to
imitate
sylvia
s
voice
and
accent
which
she
thought
very
elegant
and
she
did
so
now
speaking
carefully
and
seeing
that
jim
had
no
doubt
of
her
identity
on
the
ride
to
the
junction
she
had
only
murmured
good
evening
to
sands
being
afraid
to
say
more
at
the
junction
she
was
going
to
get
off
take
the
branch
line
to
hazelmere
and
transfer
there
to
the
philadelphia
express
in
the
women
s
which
would
probably
be
deserted
at
that
hour
she
intended
taking
off
sylvia
s
coat
and
hair
and
reappearing
as
the
modest
and
insignificant
lady
s
maid
she
had
thought
this
out
in
the
afternoon
deciding
that
sylvia
would
probably
communicate
with
her
mother
in
the
morning
and
that
the
theft
would
then
be
discovered
inquiries
started
for
the
woman
who
had
been
seen
on
the
train
would
lead
to
nothing
as
that
woman
would
have
dropped
out
of
sight
at
the
junction
everything
worked
without
a
hitch
the
was
empty
and
she
had
ample
time
to
take
off
the
hair
and
put
it
in
the
bag
hang
the
coat
over
her
arm
with
the
lining
turned
out
and
even
pinch
the
small
soft
hat
into
another
shape
no
one
would
have
thought
the
woman
who
went
into
the
was
the
woman
who
came
out
and
then
came
the
first
she
opened
the
door
she
stepped
almost
into
fowler
she
was
terror
stricken
but
even
then
neither
her
luck
nor
her
wits
left
her
for
almost
the
first
sentence
he
uttered
showed
her
that
he
knew
of
the
elopement
and
gave
her
a
lead
what
to
say
she
must
have
been
a
pretty
nervy
woman
the
way
she
jumped
at
that
lead
right
off
the
bat
she
invented
the
story
about
being
sent
by
sylvia
to
wait
there
at
the
the
doctor
was
furious
and
ordered
her
into
his
auto
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
and
in
she
got
sitting
in
the
back
as
she
was
stepping
up
he
close
beside
her
she
remembered
the
gold
mesh
purse
plain
in
her
hand
like
a
flash
she
bent
forward
and
jammed
it
down
between
the
back
and
seat
the
ride
up
the
riven
rock
road
was
just
as
the
doctor
described
it
it
was
after
the
lamp
had
been
broken
and
he
was
back
in
the
car
starting
it
up
that
she
slipped
out
she
was
determined
to
get
away
with
all
her
loot
and
took
the
bag
and
coat
with
her
but
between
the
hurry
and
fear
of
the
moment
forgot
the
purse
she
wandered
through
the
woods
till
she
saw
a
small
scattering
of
lights
which
she
took
for
one
of
the
branch
line
stations
when
the
dawn
came
she
had
lost
some
of
her
nerve
and
felt
it
was
too
risky
to
carry
the
extra
things
so
she
hid
them
at
the
root
of
a
tree
took
off
the
hat
tying
the
veil
over
her
head
and
walked
across
the
fields
to
the
station
as
it
was
monday
morning
there
were
a
lot
of
laborers
men
and
women
on
the
platform
she
mingled
with
them
looking
like
them
in
her
muddy
clothes
and
tied
up
head
and
got
away
to
hazelmere
without
being
noticed
she
was
feeling
safe
in
her
furnished
room
in
philadelphia
when
she
read
of
the
murder
in
the
papers
that
scared
her
almost
to
death
and
she
lay
as
close
as
a
rabbit
in
a
burrow
afraid
to
go
out
and
cooking
her
food
on
a
gas
ring
it
was
the
man
she
had
stolen
for
who
gave
her
away
when
she
refused
to
raise
money
on
the
jewels
he
stole
the
lavalliere
and
pawned
it
under
the
trees
where
she
said
she
d
left
them
the
police
found
the
coat
and
hat
beside
them
was
the
bag
stuffed
full
of
lingerie
gloves
and
silk
stockings
and
with
the
false
hair
crowded
down
into
the
inside
pocket
besides
clearing
the
doctor
her
confession
threw
light
on
two
important
that
sylvia
had
left
the
house
at
a
little
after
six
and
the
other
that
reddy
had
been
at
the
meeting
place
at
the
time
he
said
x
after
the
excitement
of
the
french
woman
s
arrest
there
was
a
sort
of
lull
for
a
few
days
people
thought
we
were
going
to
move
right
on
and
lay
our
hands
on
the
murderer
but
outside
of
proving
that
the
doctor
wasn
t
the
guilty
one
the
crime
was
no
nearer
a
solution
than
it
had
been
the
day
it
happened
though
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
it
it
began
to
die
down
in
the
public
interest
and
it
was
then
that
the
papers
got
to
calling
it
the
hesketh
mystery
in
place
of
the
hesketh
murder
the
reporters
left
the
inn
and
went
back
to
live
in
town
coming
in
every
few
days
to
snoop
around
for
any
new
items
that
might
have
turned
up
babbitts
came
oftener
than
the
others
and
stayed
later
and
he
and
i
had
several
more
walks
we
were
getting
to
be
like
partners
in
some
kind
of
secret
business
meeting
after
dark
and
pacing
along
the
roads
round
the
village
with
the
stars
shining
overhead
and
the
ground
hard
and
crumbly
under
our
feet
if
you
d
met
us
you
d
have
set
us
down
for
a
pair
of
lovers
walking
side
by
side
under
the
dark
of
the
trees
but
if
you
d
followed
along
and
listened
you
d
have
got
cured
of
that
romantic
notion
mighty
quick
our
flirtation
was
all
about
evidence
and
leads
and
so
much
as
a
compliment
or
a
baby
stare
from
start
to
finish
i
don
t
believe
if
you
d
asked
babbitts
he
could
have
told
you
whether
my
eyes
were
brown
or
blue
and
as
for
his
being
a
nice
kid
he
didn
t
figure
out
any
more
important
than
the
weathervane
on
the
methodist
church
it
was
the
case
that
drew
us
together
like
a
magnet
drawing
nails
we
d
speculate
about
it
look
at
it
all
round
as
if
it
was
something
we
had
hold
of
in
our
hands
i
guess
it
was
the
mysteriousness
of
it
that
attracted
him
and
the
reward
too
there
was
more
in
it
for
me
as
you
he
never
got
a
hint
of
it
was
one
evening
nearly
four
weeks
after
the
murder
that
he
gave
me
a
meaning
to
of
course
for
even
then
i
d
found
out
he
was
the
kind
that
wouldn
t
hurt
a
fly
we
were
talking
of
jack
reddy
who
we
d
seen
that
evening
in
the
village
the
first
time
since
the
inquest
you
know
said
babbitts
it
s
queer
but
i
keep
thinking
of
that
yarn
of
jasper
s
that
evening
in
the
gilt
edge
i
drew
away
like
he
d
stuck
a
pin
into
me
why
do
you
think
about
i
asked
loud
and
sharp
why
he
said
slow
as
if
he
was
considering
i
suppose
because
it
was
so
plausible
and
i
ve
been
wondering
if
many
other
people
have
thought
of
it
i
guess
they
have
i
answered
kind
of
fierce
there
s
fools
enough
in
the
world
god
knows
to
think
of
anything
i
make
no
doubt
there
s
people
who
ve
tried
to
work
out
that
did
it
the
reward
tempting
them
to
lies
and
sin
babbitts
looked
at
me
surprised
what
s
there
to
get
mad
about
he
asked
i
m
not
for
a
moment
suggesting
that
reddy
really
had
any
hand
in
it
why
he
could
no
more
have
killed
that
girl
than
could
kill
i
simmered
was
awful
sweet
the
way
he
said
it
then
you
oughtn
t
to
be
casting
suspicions
on
an
innocent
man
i
said
still
grouchy
oh
you
re
such
a
little
pepper
pot
do
you
think
for
a
moment
i
d
say
this
to
anybody
but
you
look
at
me
i
looked
into
his
eyes
clear
as
a
baby
s
in
the
starlight
if
you
believe
i
m
the
sort
of
fellow
who
d
put
a
slur
on
reddy
i
wonder
you
ll
come
out
this
way
and
walk
with
me
i
smiled
i
couldn
t
help
it
and
babbitts
seeing
i
was
all
right
again
tucked
his
hand
inside
my
arm
and
we
walked
on
very
friendly
being
ignorant
of
the
true
state
of
my
feelings
he
went
straight
back
to
the
subject
now
understand
that
i
mean
nothing
against
reddy
and
that
i
ve
never
said
this
to
a
soul
but
you
but
ever
since
the
inquest
there
s
been
one
thing
that
s
puzzled
length
of
time
he
was
out
that
night
he
explained
that
i
said
i
know
he
did
and
everybody
s
accepted
his
explanation
but
seven
hours
in
a
racing
car
he
could
have
gone
to
philadelphia
taken
in
a
show
and
come
back
but
he
told
all
about
it
i
insisted
he
did
said
babbitts
but
i
ll
tell
you
something
miss
ourselves
not
to
go
an
inch
s
story
impressed
me
as
the
undiluted
truth
till
he
got
to
part
of
it
what
do
you
mean
i
said
low
and
being
afraid
i
was
going
to
tremble
i
pulled
my
arm
away
from
him
was
watching
him
very
close
and
when
he
began
to
talk
about
that
night
ride
some
sort
of
change
came
over
him
it
was
very
subtle
i
never
heard
anyone
speak
of
it
but
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
he
was
making
an
effort
to
give
an
impression
of
frankness
the
rest
of
his
testimony
had
the
hesitating
natural
tone
of
a
man
who
is
nervous
and
maybe
uncertain
of
his
facts
but
when
he
came
to
that
he
looked
to
me
as
if
he
was
internally
bracing
himself
as
if
he
was
on
dangerous
ground
and
knew
it
if
i
d
been
able
to
speak
as
well
as
that
those
were
exactly
the
words
i
would
have
used
i
cleared
my
throat
before
i
answered
looks
like
to
me
babbitts
that
you
ought
to
be
writing
novels
instead
of
press
stories
oh
no
he
said
careless
but
you
see
i
ve
been
on
a
number
of
cases
like
this
and
a
fellow
gets
observant
it
s
whole
thing
if
that
french
woman
s
evidence
is
to
be
trusted
miss
hesketh
leave
the
house
early
to
keep
that
date
with
the
voice
man
i
didn
t
say
a
word
looking
straight
before
me
at
the
lights
of
longwood
through
the
trees
babbitts
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
swinging
along
beside
me
went
on
that
s
what
s
made
me
think
of
jasper
s
hypothetical
case
do
you
remember
he
said
reddy
d
come
down
to
the
meeting
place
found
miss
hesketh
with
the
other
man
and
got
into
a
berserker
rage
say
what
you
like
it
does
work
out
when
he
bid
me
good
night
at
galway
s
side
door
he
wanted
to
know
why
i
was
so
silent
even
if
i
d
wanted
to
give
a
reason
i
hadn
t
one
to
give
don
t
you
believe
for
a
minute
i
was
really
was
just
that
i
hated
anyone
even
to
yarn
that
way
about
jack
reddy
i
d
known
then
what
was
coming
it
began
to
come
two
days
later
the
first
shadow
that
was
going
to
darken
and
spread
i
m
going
on
too
quick
i
d
just
had
my
lunch
put
away
my
box
and
swept
off
the
crumbs
when
i
got
a
call
for
the
depot
from
the
rifle
run
camp
that
s
a
summer
resort
way
up
in
the
hills
beyond
hochalaga
lake
the
voice
with
a
brogue
on
it
as
rich
as
butter
was
pat
donahue
s
jim
s
eldest
son
a
sort
of
idle
scamp
who
d
gone
up
to
the
camp
to
work
last
summer
and
had
stayed
on
because
there
was
nothing
to
least
that
s
what
jim
said
i
made
the
connection
and
listened
in
not
because
i
was
expecting
anything
worth
hearing
but
because
i
wasn
t
taking
any
chances
i
guess
pat
donahue
was
the
last
person
anyone
would
expect
to
come
jumping
into
the
middle
of
the
hesketh
that
s
what
he
did
with
both
feet
hard
i
didn
t
pay
much
attention
at
first
and
then
a
sentence
caught
my
ear
and
i
grew
still
as
a
statue
my
eyes
staring
straight
in
front
even
breathing
carefully
as
if
they
could
hear
it
was
pat
s
voice
the
voice
answering
jim
s
at
the
depot
me
and
bridger
was
in
to
hochalaga
lake
yesterday
forenoon
fishin
through
the
ice
can
you
hear
me
paw
fine
are
you
payin
for
a
call
to
tell
me
you
re
that
idle
you
have
to
play
at
fishin
jest
you
listen
close
and
hear
me
before
you
come
back
i
seen
in
the
papers
that
miss
hesketh
that

murdered

one
glove
lost
do
you
mind
what
the
one
that
wasn
t
lost
looked
like
sure
i
shouldn
t
i
didn
t
i
see
it
at
the
inquest
will
you
be
answering
me
instead
of
tellin
me
what
you
saw

t
i
doin
it
it
was
a
glove
light
gray
with
three
pearl
buttons
and
a
furrener
s
name
stamped
in
the
inside
well
then
i
got
the
feller
to
hand
i
found
it
on
the
wharf
at
the
lake
in
front
of
the
bungalow
seeing
that
there
s
ten
thousand
dollars
reward
offered
i
thought
i
d
be
a
blowin
in
the
price
of
a
call
to
tell
you
though
it
s
so
ungrateful
ye
are
for
the
news
i
m
sorry
i
done
it
but
i
ll
not
bother
you
no
more
for
it
s
in
to
the
district
attorney
i
ll
be
goin
with
the
evidence
that
was
what
he
did
that
very
afternoon
by
the
next
day
everybody
in
longwood
knew
how
pat
donahue
had
found
sylvia
hesketh
s
missing
glove
on
the
wharf
just
in
front
of
the
reddy
bungalow
there
was
a
person
who
didn
t
close
an
eye
that
night
and
i
guess
you
know
what
her
name
was
gee
those
were
awful
days
that
followed
when
i
think
of
them
now
i
can
feel
a
sort
of
sinking
come
back
on
me
and
my
face
gets
stiff
like
it
was
made
of
leather
and
couldn
t
limber
up
for
a
smile
each
morning
i
d
get
up
scared
sick
of
what
i
was
going
to
hear
that
day
and
each
evening
i
d
go
to
bed
filled
with
a
darkness
as
black
as
the
night
outside
i
couldn
t
believe
it
and
i
ll
tell
you
and
you
can
judge
for
yourself
the
police
went
out
to
hochalaga
and
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
house
and
its
surroundings
the
bungalow
stood
at
one
end
of
the
lake
right
on
the
shore
with
a
little
wharf
jutting
out
in
front
of
it
into
the
water
the
door
opened
into
a
big
furnished
very
pretty
and
comfortable
with
green
madras
curtains
at
the
windows
a
green
art
rug
on
the
floor
and
wicker
chairs
with
green
denim
cushions
at
one
side
was
a
big
brick
fireplace
with
a
copper
kettle
hanging
on
a
crane
and
over
in
a
corner
was
a
desk
with
a
telephone
on
it
along
the
walls
were
bookcases
full
of
books
and
in
the
center
was
a
table
with
chairs
drawn
up
at
either
side
of
it
the
police
noticed
right
off
that
it
didn
t
have
the
damp
musty
feel
of
a
place
shut
up
through
a
long
spell
of
rain
the
air
was
cold
and
dry
and
they
could
scent
the
odor
of
wood
fires
and
a
slight
faint
smell
of
cigar
smoke
then
they
saw
that
the
fireplace
was
piled
high
with
ashes
and
that
several
cigarette
ends
were
scattered
on
the
hearth
on
the
center
table
was
a
shaded
lamp
and
near
it
a
match
box
with
burnt
matches
strewn
round
on
the
floor
the
desk
drawer
was
open
and
the
papers
inside
all
tossed
and
littered
about
as
if
someone
had
gone
through
them
in
a
hurry
two
armchairs
stood
on
either
side
of
the
table
and
another
was
in
front
of
the
fireplace
all
over
the
floor
were
earth
stains
as
if
muddy
feet
had
been
walking
about
there
were
no
signs
that
the
place
had
been
broken
and
doors
were
locked
and
the
locks
in
good
condition
outside
against
the
wall
of
the
house
they
found
a
pile
of
broken
china
what
seemed
to
be
the
remains
of
a
tea
set
it
was
not
till
the
search
was
nearly
ended
that
one
of
the
men
studying
the
grass
along
the
roadside
for
traces
of
footprints
came
on
a
gasoline
drum
hidden
among
the
bushes
but
that
wasn
t
the
up
the
road
to
within
a
few
yards
of
the
wharf
were
the
tracks
of
auto
wheels
at
the
time
when
these
tracks
were
made
the
road
was
deep
in
mud
which
about
the
wharf
had
evidently
been
a
regular
pool
the
driver
of
the
motor
had
stopped
his
car
at
the
edge
of
this
got
out
and
walked
through
it
to
the
bungalow
clear
as
if
they
had
been
cast
in
plaster
his
footprints
went
from
where
the
ruts
ended
to
the
edge
of
the
wharf
there
just
at
the
corner
of
the
planks
three
small
pointed
footprints
met
woman
s
either
the
man
had
carried
the
woman
or
she
had
picked
her
way
along
the
grass
by
the
roadside
and
joining
him
on
the
planks
had
made
a
step
or
two
into
the
soft
earth
on
the
wharf
the
prints
were
lost
in
a
broken
caking
of
mud
the
man
s
went
back
to
the
car
close
to
where
they
had
come
from
it
and
they
returned
as
they
had
jack
reddy
s
shoes
fitted
the
large
prints
and
sylvia
hesketh
s
the
small
ones
it
came
on
longwood
with
an
awful
shock
the
faces
of
the
people
were
all
dull
and
dazed
looking
as
if
they
were
knocked
half
silly
by
a
blow
they
couldn
t
believe
yet
there
it
was
the
papers
printed
terrible
the
earth
gives
up
a
murderer
s
secret
jack
frost
versus
jack
reddy
there
were
imaginary
accounts
of
how
reddy
could
have
done
it
and
jasper
in
his
paper
had
a
long
article
worked
out
like
the
story
he
d
told
us
that
night
in
the
gilt
edge
but
with
all
the
holes
filled
up
everything
was
against
reddy
even
the
telephone
message
that
sylvia
had
sent
him
from
the
wayside
arbor
couldn
t
be
traced
the
corona
operator
could
remember
nothing
about
it
and
there
was
no
jack
reddy
s
word
and
nobody
believed
it
they
had
him
up
before
the
district
attorney
and
his
examination
was
published
in
the
papers
i
can
t
put
it
all
s
not
it
was
bad
after
i
read
it
i
sat
still
in
my
room
feeling
seasick
and
my
face
in
the
glass
frightened
me
when
they
asked
him
if
he
had
been
at
the
bungalow
that
night
he
said
he
had
he
had
gone
there
after
he
had
given
up
his
hunt
for
sylvia
why
didn
t
you
say
this
at
the
inquest
was
asked
he
answered
that
he
hadn
t
thought
it
was
then
he
stopped
as
if
he
wasn
t
sure
and
after
a
moment
or
two
said
i
didn
t
see
that
it
threw
any
light
on
the
murder
as
i
was
alone
you
wished
to
conceal
the
fact
that
you
were
there
then
to
that
he
answered
sharp
i
did
i
saw
no
reason
to
give
my
movements
in
detail
as
they
were
of
no
importance
why
did
you
go
there
i
was
angry
and
excited
and
it
was
a
place
where
i
could
be
quiet
asked
how
long
he
had
been
in
the
bungalow
he
said
he
wasn
t
might
have
been
an
hour
or
two
he
had
lit
the
fire
and
sat
in
front
of
it
thinking
and
smoking
cigarettes
didn
t
you
hunt
in
the
desk
for
something
he
answered
with
a
sort
of
shrug
as
if
he
d
forgotten
oh
was
hunting
for
a
bill
i
thought
i
left
there
to
the
questions
about
she
had
been
there
with
answered
almost
violently
that
she
had
not
that
he
had
not
seen
her
there
or
anywhere
else
that
night
did
you
notice
any
footprints
in
the
mud
when
you
came
i
did
not
there
were
no
evidences
on
the
wharf
or
in
the
house
of
anyone
having
been
there
before
you
none
the
bungalow
was
locked
and
undisturbed
then
they
switched
off
on
to
the
gasoline
drum
and
asked
him
if
he
had
filled
the
tank
there
and
he
said
he
might
have
but
he
didn
t
remember
was
it
dark
when
you
left
the
place
bright
moonlight
you
remember
that
yes
i
recollect
thinking
the
ride
back
would
be
easier
than
the
ride
up
in
the
dark
why
did
you
say
at
the
inquest
that
you
filled
the
tank
somewhere
on
the
turnpike
i
suppose
i
thought
i
had
in
the
angry
and
excited
state
i
was
in
small
things
made
no
impression
on
me
i
had
no
clear
memory
of
where
i
d
done
it
all
the
papers
agreed
that
his
testimony
was
unsatisfactory
and
made
much
of
his
manner
which
under
an
effort
to
be
calm
showed
a
spasmodic
nervous
violence
a
day
later
he
was
arrested
at
firehill
and
taken
to
bloomington
jail
to
await
indictment
by
the
grand
jury
illustration
day
later
he
was
arrested
at
firehill
and
taken
to
bloomington
that
i
ever
forget
it
i
heard
the
sounds
in
the
street
dying
away
and
then
the
silence
the
deep
lovely
silence
that
comes
over
the
village
at
midnight
and
in
it
i
could
hear
my
heart
beating
and
as
i
lay
with
my
eyes
wide
open
i
could
see
on
the
darkness
like
a
picture
drawn
in
fire
jack
reddy
in
the
electric
chair
xi
looking
back
now
i
can
remember
dressing
the
next
morning
all
trembly
and
with
my
hands
damp
and
my
face
in
the
glass
white
and
pinched
like
an
east
side
baby
s
in
a
hot
wave
but
there
wasn
t
anything
trembly
about
the
thinking
part
of
me
that
was
working
better
than
it
had
ever
worked
before
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
steel
springs
going
swift
and
sure
like
an
engine
that
went
independent
of
the
rest
of
my
machinery
and
thank
god
it
did
work
that
way
for
it
had
thought
of
something
the
idea
came
on
me
in
the
second
part
of
the
night
flashed
out
of
the
dark
like
a
wireless
i
d
been
wondering
about
the
man
who
made
the
telephone
date
with
unknown
voice
they
d
got
to
calling
him
people
thought
as
jasper
had
said
that
reddy
had
found
her
with
this
man
and
there
had
been
a
terrible
scene
but
whatever
had
happened
the
unknown
voice
was
the
clew
to
the
mystery
the
police
had
tried
to
locate
him
tried
and
failed
now
was
going
to
hunt
for
him
my
plan
was
perfectly
simple
from
what
i
had
seen
myself
and
heard
from
anne
hennessey
i
was
sure
i
knew
every
lover
that
sylvia
had
had
i
was
going
to
call
each
one
of
them
up
on
the
phone
and
listen
to
their
voices
and
i
wasn
t
going
to
tell
a
soul
about
it
everybody
would
as
you
say
as
you
read
but
all
those
men
gave
satisfactory
alibis
i
knew
that
as
well
as
anyone
but
it
didn
t
cut
any
ice
with
me
i
didn
t
care
what
they
d
proved
i
was
going
to
hear
their
voices
and
see
for
myself
if
i
was
successful
then
i
d
tell
babbitts
and
have
him
advise
me
what
to
do
i
d
heard
jack
reddy
had
retained
wilbur
whitney
the
great
criminal
lawyer
but
i
wouldn
t
have
known
whether
to
go
to
him
or
the
police
or
the
district
attorney
and
if
i
did
it
at
all
i
wanted
to
do
it
right
now
that
there
were
three
of
us
in
the
exchange
my
holiday
had
been
changed
to
monday
and
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
put
my
plan
into
execution
till
that
day
i
didn
t
want
to
be
hurried
or
confused
by
possible
interruptions
and
also
i
wanted
to
hear
the
voices
at
short
range
and
could
do
that
better
from
the
city
i
telephoned
over
to
babbitts
that
i
d
be
in
town
monday
to
do
some
shopping
and
he
made
a
date
to
meet
me
at
the
entrance
of
the
knickerbocker
hotel
and
dine
with
me
at
some
joint
near
times
square
monday
morning
i
was
up
bright
and
early
and
dressed
myself
in
my
best
clothes
from
the
telephone
book
i
got
the
numbers
of
the
four
men
who
were
known
to
have
been
sylvia
s
lovers
and
robinson
dunham
and
cokesbury
i
had
found
out
from
anne
what
their
businesses
were
and
i
had
no
trouble
in
locating
them
with
the
slip
of
paper
in
my
purse
i
took
the
train
and
was
in
town
before
midday
on
the
way
over
i
worked
out
what
i
d
say
to
each
of
them
i
was
going
to
ask
carisbrook
who
was
a
soft
guy
if
he
knew
where
mazie
lorraine
a
manicure
who
d
once
been
in
the
waldorf
had
moved
to
it
was
nervy
but
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
dig
he
having
put
on
airs
and
treated
me
like
a
doormat
robinson
was
had
a
common
name
and
i
d
got
the
wrong
man
excuse
please
awful
sorry
dunham
was
a
lawyer
and
i
was
a
dressmaker
that
a
customer
wouldn
t
pay
and
cokesbury
was
easy
d
heard
cokesbury
lodge
was
for
rent
and
was
looking
for
a
country
place
i
got
carisbrook
first
and
he
was
as
mad
as
a
hornet
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
i
don
t
know
any
manicure
called
lorraine
or
anything
else
i
ve
never
been
manicured
in
the
any
other
the
city
the
woman
is
a
and
so
forth
and
so
on
sputtering
and
fizzing
along
the
wire
i
had
hard
work
not
to
laugh
and
in
the
middle
of
it
i
hung
up
for
he
had
a
thin
high
squeak
on
him
like
an
old
maid
scared
by
a
mouse
robinson
was
a
sport
i
liked
fine
don
t
apologize
it
s
the
penalty
of
being
called
robinson
still
there
s
a
bright
side
to
every
cloud
it
might
have
been
smith
you
know
it
wasn
t
robinson
he
talked
with
a
dialect
that
sounded
like
jasper
s
english
i
guess
dunham
was
very
smooth
and
awful
hard
to
get
rid
of
he
kept
on
asking
questions
and
i
had
to
think
quick
and
speak
unnaturally
intelligent
in
the
middle
of
d
got
what
i
said
it
was
too
complicated
to
tell
over
the
phone
and
i
d
be
in
at
two
and
my
name
was
pendleton
it
wasn
t
dunham
when
i
tackled
cokesbury
i
ran
into
the
first
snag
i
tried
his
office
and
a
real
pleasant
young
man
you
get
to
know
a
young
voice
from
an
old
one
asked
me
what
i
wanted
i
said
business
and
he
answered
what
is
the
nature
of
your
business
madam
i
d
rather
tell
that
to
cokesbury
i
said
cokesbury
doesn
t
like
to
be
interrupted
in
the
office
if
you
ll
tell
me
what
you
want
to
see
him
say
young
feller
said
i
in
a
cool
classy
way
suppose
we
stop
this
pleasant
little
talk
and
you
trot
into
cokesbury
and
say
a
lady
s
waiting
on
the
wire
very
well
he
answered
calm
and
cheerful
i
ll
do
just
as
you
say
there
was
a
wait
and
then
he
was
back
cokesbury
says
it
s
impossible
for
him
to
come
to
the
phone
and
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
your
business
is
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
wait
till
he
s
not
so
busy
i
answered
languid
like
i
ve
heard
ladies
when
they
re
mad
and
don
t
want
to
show
it
and
i
hung
up
afterward
i
saw
i
d
made
a
mistake
for
when
i
called
up
two
hours
later
that
polite
guy
was
still
on
the
job
and
handed
me
the
same
line
of
talk
i
went
into
a
drugstore
and
looked
up
residence
it
was
in
the
east
fifties
and
at
six
i
tried
him
there
i
drew
a
man
that
i
guess
was
a
servant

cokesbury
home
who
is
it
that
doesn
t
matter

a
i
said
sort
of
coaxing
and
sweet
i
ll
try

said
the
voice
and
i
could
hear
the
echo
of
his
feet
as
he
walked
off
presently
he
was
back
beg
pardon
ma
am
but
cokesbury
says
he
can
t
possibly

me
the
message

that
time

getting
mad

to
be
a
district
messenger
boy
as
well
as
a
butler

not
too
much
trouble

you
mind
telling
me
what
cokesbury
s
friends

when
they
want
a
word

the
phone

the
butler

they
are
and
what

am
that
s
the
orders
in
this
house
when
babbitts
and
i
were
sitting
at
a
table
in
a
little
dago
joint
near
broadway
i
couldn
t
help
but
tell
him
what
i
d
been
doing
he
looked
at
me
with
his
eyes
as
big
as
and
then
began
to
laugh
well
what
do
you
make
of
that
spending
your
holiday
and
your
nickels
rounding
up
a
lot
of
men
that
rounded
themselves
up
weeks
ago
i
want
to
get
that
voice
but
everyone
of
them
have
proved
that
voice
couldn
t
be
theirs
maybe
they
did
said
i
but
i
want
to
know
it
myself
listen
to
her
he
said
looking
round
the
table
as
if
a
crowd
was
collected
calmly
brushing
aside
the
police
the
detectives
the
might
of
the
law
and
the
strong
arm
of
the
press
and
anything
else
that
stands
round
trying
to
discourage
me
far
be
it
from
me
to
discourage
you
in
any
eccentricity
that
may
develop
but
there
s
no
need
in
following
up
cokesbury
for
we
know
that
he
was
marooned
in
cokesbury
lodge
i
don
t
care
what
we
know
the
only
things
i
believe
are
the
things
i
see
myself
thomas
he
said
laughing
and
i
didn
t
see
any
sense
in
his
calling
me
that
but
he
often
said
things
i
wasn
t
on
to
do
you
intend
to
camp
on
his
trail
all
night
i
do
i
answered
as
soon
as
you
get
through
lapping
up
that
red
ink
i
m
going
to
go
to
the
nearest
pay
station
and
ring
up
edward
residence
i
ll
toddle
along
he
said
anything
goes
with
me
that
adds
to
the
entertainment
of
mary
mckenna
morganthau
he
held
up
his
glass
as
if
he
was
drinking
a
toast
and
something
about
the
look
of
don
t
know
me
get
all
embarrassed
it
never
happened
before
and
it
took
me
so
by
surprise
i
blushed
and
was
glad
i
d
dropped
my
gloves
on
the
floor
so
i
could
bend
down
and
hide
how
red
my
face
was
i
tried
edward
residence
at
a
drug
store
on
broadway
and
again
i
drew
that
butler
gink
who
was
sort
of
sassy
and
hung
up
quick
then
we
walked
along
and
i
could
see
that
babbitts
was
getting
interested
tell
you
what
he
said
that
servant
knows
you
i
ll
make
the
connection
say
i
want
to
see
cokesbury
on
business
and
if
i
get
him
hand
on
the
receiver
to
you
we
fixed
it
that
way
went
into
a
hotel
and
i
stood
at
the
door
of
the
booth
while
babbitts
got
the
house
standing
at
his
elbow
i
could
see
he
was
up
against
the
same
proposition
as
i
had
been
he
finally
had
to
say
he
wanted
to
see
cokesbury
about
renting
cokesbury
lodge
he
turned
to
me
with
his
hand
over
the
mouthpiece
and
said
he
s
there
and
he
won
t
come
has
the
servant
gone
to
get
him
yes
he
wouldn
t
say
whether
his
boss
was
home
or
not
but
his
willingness
to
take
the
message
gave
him
away
now
stand
close
and
if
it
s
a
new
voice
i
won
t
say
a
word
just
get
up
and
let
you
slide
into
my
place
he
started
and
turned
back
to
the
instrument
yes
what
i
could
see
a
look
of
surprise
come
over
his
face
soon
you
don
t
a
few
days
hasn
t
any
idea
of
renting
thanks
that
s
he
hung
up
and
turned
to
me
it
was
the
servant
cokesbury
hasn
t
any
intention
of
renting
and
is
leaving
for
europe
for
europe
i
cried
out
the
man
didn
t
know
exactly
he
said
he
thought
in
a
few
days
we
walked
down
the
street
silent
and
thoughtful
the
only
feeling
i
had
at
first
was
disappointment
i
didn
t
get
the
whole
thing
clear
as
babbitts
did
it
came
on
him
all
in
a
minute
he
told
me
afterward
we
were
on
broadway
as
light
as
day
with
the
signs
and
people
walking
by
us
and
crowding
in
between
us
as
if
they
were
hurrying
to
catch
trains
i
felt
babbitts
hand
go
round
my
arm
steering
me
into
a
side
street
it
was
darker
there
and
there
were
only
a
few
we
slackened
up
and
still
with
his
hand
around
my
arm
he
bent
his
face
down
toward
my
ear
and
said
low
as
if
he
was
afraid
someone
was
listening
kiddo
are
you
on
to
what
cokesbury
don
t
you
get
it
he
won
t
answer
the
phone
do
you
mean
he
won
t
answer
at
all
not
unless
it
s
someone
he
knows
he
s
got
his
clerks
in
the
office
holding
the
fort
and
his
servants
at
home
we
were
just
under
a
lamp
and
i
stopped
with
my
mouth
falling
open
for
sudden
like
a
flash
of
light
it
came
to
me
soapy
i
gasped
and
wheeled
round
on
him
his
face
bent
down
toward
me
was
intent
like
a
hunting
dog
s
when
it
sees
a
bird
his
eyes
bright
and
fixed
looking
straight
into
mine
you
ve
made
the
first
real
discovery
in
this
case
molly
morganthau
cokesbury
s
scared
scared
so
scared
he
s
lost
his
nerve
and
is
lighting
out
to
europe
we
walked
round
into
bryant
park
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
we
were
so
excited
we
didn
t
notice
i
d
grabbed
babbitt
s
hand
and
kept
hold
of
it
that
it
was
freezing
cold
that
we
d
got
on
a
bench
with
a
drunk
all
huddled
up
on
the
other
end
we
were
as
certain
as
if
he
d
confessed
it
that
cokesbury
was
the
unknown
voice
and
that
he
d
killed
sylvia
hesketh
we
just
brushed
his
alibi
aside
as
if
he
d
never
made
one
and
planned
how
i
was
to
hear
him
before
he
got
away
to
europe
we
laid
plots
there
in
the
dark
sitting
close
together
to
keep
warm
with
the
drunk
all
lopped
over
and
muttering
to
himself
on
the
seat
beside
us
when
babbitts
left
me
at
the
ferry
we
d
fixed
it
that
he
was
to
call
me
up
the
next
day
and
tell
me
what
he
d
done
in
town
and
i
was
to
tell
him
what
i
d
accomplished
at
my
end
of
the
line
the
next
morning
i
tried
cokesbury
s
office
with
the
same
results
at
one
babbitts
called
me
and
said
he
d
tried
twice
to
get
him
as
a
test
and
been
told
that
cokesbury
wasn
t
down
and
his
whereabouts
were
unknown
by
inquiries
at
the
steamship
offices
he
d
found
that
our
s
what
we
called
him
on
the
taken
passage
on
the
for
the
following
saturday
that
was
four
days
days
to
hear
the
man
who
wouldn
t
answer
the
phone
that
afternoon
i
had
an
idea
called
up
anne
hennessey
and
asked
her
to
meet
me
at
the
gilt
edge
for
supper
she
came
and
afterward
in
my
room
at
galway
s
i
told
had
to
but
she
s
and
i
knew
she
agreed
to
help
she
was
to
come
to
the
exchange
the
next
morning
call
up
cokesbury
and
say
she
was
fowler
who
wanted
to
bid
him
before
he
left
while
she
was
to
listen
we
did
she
d
have
lost
her
job
if
she
d
been
found
i
heard
the
clerk
tell
her
that
cokesbury
wasn
t
in
his
office
that
he
didn
t
know
where
she
could
find
him
and
that
it
was
very
little
use
trying
to
get
him
on
the
phone
as
he
was
so
much
occupied
prior
to
his
departure
when
anne
came
out
of
the
booth
i
was
crying
i
guess
i
never
before
in
my
life
had
my
nerves
as
strung
up
as
they
were
then
it
wasn
t
long
after
that
that
i
had
a
call
from
babbitts
he
d
been
able
to
do
nothing
when
he
heard
of
my
last
attempt
he
said
he
s
not
answering
any
calls
at
all
now
his
own
mother
couldn
t
get
him
it
s
no
use
trying
that
line
any
more
we
ve
got
to
think
up
some
other
way
that
was
had
only
three
days
three
days
and
i
hadn
t
an
idea
how
to
do
it
three
days
and
jack
reddy
was
waiting
indictment
in
bloomington
jail
we
couldn
t
stop
cokesbury
going
or
get
anybody
else
to
stop
him
unless
we
could
light
on
something
more
definite
than
a
hello
girl
s
suspicions
xii
thursday
afternoon
i
was
sitting
in
the
exchange
feeling
as
if
the
bottom
had
fallen
out
of
the
world
i
hadn
t
given
up
m
not
the
i
think
of
anything
else
to
do
i
d
tossed
on
my
bed
all
night
thinking
i
d
dressed
thinking
i
d
tried
to
eat
thinking
i
d
put
in
the
plugs
and
made
the
connections
nothing
would
come
two
days
days
days
three
words
kept
going
through
my
head
as
if
they
were
strung
on
an
endless
chain
and
t
it
always
that
way
in
life
just
when
you
re
ready
to
throw
up
the
sponge
and
say
you
re
beaten
comes
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
new
york
call
for
azalea
like
a
dream
for
i
was
pretty
nearly
all
in
i
could
hear
the
operator
s
voice
that
you
longwood
give
me
azalea
and
then
me
answering
all
right
azalea
wait
a
minute
i
plugged
in
and
heard
that
queer
grating
sound
as
if
the
wires
were
rubbing
against
each
other
hello
new
york
all
right
for
azalea
and
then
a
woman
s
voice
clear
and
small
here
s
your
party
just
a
minute
there
you
then
a
man
s
voice
far
away
as
if
it
might
be
in
mars

that
azalea

and
it

just
as
well
to
keep
it
here
that
s
all
right

in
the
pocket
have
you
found
any
key
i
haven
t
looked
hold
the
wire
while
i
see
there
was
a
pause
while
i
prayed
no
one
would
come
in
or
call
up
my
prayer
was
answered
there
was
nothing
to
interrupt
when
i
heard
the
garage
man
s
voice
again
the
key
s
there
good
work
cokesbury
s
had
the
house
here
upside
down
looking
for

and

it
to

i
guess
he
s
calculating
to
buy
a
new
one
thanks
for
your
trouble
i
dropped
the
cam
sat
tight
and
thought
people
kept
coming
in
and
out
and
calls
came
flashing
along
the
wires
and
i
worked
swift
and
steady
like
an
operator
that
s
got
no
thought
but
for
what
s
before
her
but
my
mind
was
working
like
a
steam
engine
underneath
how
could
i
get
could
i
get
him
it
was
as
if
i
had
two
brains
one
on
the
top
that
went
mechanical
like
a
watch
and
one
below
that
was
doing
the
real
business
before
the
afternoon
was
over
i
d
decided
on
a
line
of
action
i
called
up
katie
reilly
and
asked
her
if
she
d
relieve
me
at
instead
of
i
d
an
invitation
to
go
down
to
a
party
at
jersey
city
and
i
was
keen
to
get
there
early
she
agreed
and
at
six
i
was
on
the
platform
of
the
station
waiting
for
the
new
york
train
i
took
a
seat
in
the
common
coach
and
at
azalea
watched
from
the
window
and
saw
a
man
on
the
platform
give
sands
a
packet
i
knew
sands
well
and
when
he
passed
back
through
my
car
nodded
to
him
and
he
stopped
and
stood
in
the
aisle
talking
it
wasn
t
long
before
i
said
careless
i
hear
cokesbury
lodge
is
for
rent
i
ain
t
heard
it
said
sands
but
i
ain
t
surprised
now
he
s
sent
his
family
away
he
don
t
want
a
house
that
size
on
his
hands
has
he
been
down
lately
lem
me
s
several
weeks
last
time
was
the
sunday
before
sylvia
hesketh
s
murder
i
knew
all
that
but
it
doesn
t
do
to
jump
at
what
you
re
after
too
quick
lucky
for
him
he
could
prove
his
car
was
on
the
blink
that
time
i
said
looking
languid
out
of
the
window
sure
he
and
reddy
were
the
only
ones
of
her
fellers
within
striking
distance
but
no
one
ever
d
suspicion
cokesbury
he
ain
t
the
murderin
kind
too
jolly
and
easy
i
hear
he
s
goin
to
europe
is
he
now
where
d
you
hear
that
from
miner
that
runs
the
azalea
garage
he
come
down
to
the
station
just
now
and
gave
me
a
package
something
cokesbury
left
in
the
motor
the
last
time
he
was
down
i
m
to
hand
it
over
to
his
servant
at
jersey
city
is
it
love
letters
that
he
don
t
want
to
leave
behind
no
i
guess
he
s
careful
of
them
here
it
is
he
drew
out
of
his
breast
pocket
an
envelope
with
cokesbury
s
name
and
address
written
on
it
and
held
it
out
to
me
that
ain
t
no
love
letter
i
pinched
it
it
s
a
key
it
may
open
the
desk
where
the
love
letters
are
kept
i
guess
he
s
too
fly
to
keep
any
dangerous
papers
like
that
around
yes
i
says
they
might
set
the
house
on
fire
well
ain
t
you
the
sassy
kid
says
he
and
then
the
train
slowing
up
for
a
station
he
walked
on
up
the
aisle
in
the
jersey
city
depot
i
went
like
a
streak
for
the
telephone
exchange
my
one
chance
was
to
catch
him
at
dinner
and
i
gave
the
operator
the
number
of
his
house
when
she
pointed
to
the
booth
i
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
the
voice
that
answered
me
was
a
woman
cook
s
i
guess
she
began
right
off
yes
this
is
cokesbury
s
residence
but
you
can
t
see
him
wait
i
almost
screamed
scared
that
she
was
going
to
disconnect
this
is
important
it
s
about
a
key
i
ve
just
found
if
cokesbury
s
there
tell
him
a
lady
wants
to
see
him
about
a
key
she
picked
up
a
few
minutes
ago
on
the
new
jersey
train
all
right
hold
the
wire
i
knew
he
d
come
my
heart
was
beating
so
i
had
to
hold
it
hard
with
my
free
hand
and
i
had
to
bite
my
lips
to
make
them
limber
but
honest
to
god
when
i
heard
and
distinct
right
in
my
thought
i
was
going
to
faint
for
at
last
i
d
got
the
voice
what
s
this
about
finding
a
key
he
said
gruff
and
sharp

and
on

pullman
step

a
package
which

a
key
in
it

noticed
that
it
was
addressed
to
you
and
i
looked
you
up
in
the
telephone
book
and
am
phoning
now
from
jersey

was
very
cordial

his
voice

kind
of
you
and
very
thoughtful

i

greatest
inconvenience

had
been
lost

just
a
passenger
traveling
down
on
the
train
awful
glad
i
could
be
of
any
service
i
waited
a
minute
till
i
got
my
heart
quieted
down
then
took
a
call
for
babbitts
paper
luck

with
me
all
round
that
night
for
he
was
there
i
couldn
t
tell
him

i
told
him
enough
to
show
him

d
landed

and
he
answered
to
come
across
to
town
and
he
d
meet
me
at
the
ferry
i
caught
a
boat
as
it
pulled
out
of
the
slip
and
at
the
other
side
he
was
waiting
for
me

on
he
said
putting
his
hand
through
my
arm
and
walking
quick
for
the
street
i
got
a
taxi
here
we
ll
charge
it
up
to
the
defense
i
got
in
supposing
he
was
going
to
take
me
somewhere
to
dinner
but
he
wasn
t
when
i
heard
where
we
were
bound
i
was
sort
of
was
to
wilbur
whitney
s
house
jack
reddy
s
lawyer
he
s
expecting
us
babbitts
explained
i
called
him
up
right
after
i
d
heard
from
you
you
see
kiddo
we
don
t
want
to
lose
a
minute
for
we
can
t
stop
cokesbury
going
unless
we
got
something
to
stop
him
for
whitney
s
house
was
a
big
grand
mansion
just
off
fifth
avenue
a
butler
let
us
in
and
without
waiting
to
hear
who
we
were
showed
us
into
a
room
with
lights
in
bunches
along
the
walls
small
spindly
gold
chairs
and
sofas
and
a
floor
that
shone
like
glass
between
elegant
soft
rugs
there
was
some
class
to
it
and
babbitts
and
i
looked
like
a
pair
of
tramps
sitting
side
by
side
on
two
of
the
gold
chairs
i
was
nervous
but
babbitts
kept
me
up
telling
me
whitney
was
a
delightful
gentleman
and
was
going
to
jump
for
all
i
had
to
say
then
we
heard
steps
coming
down
the
i
swallowed
hard
being
dry
in
the
mouth
what
with
fright
and
having
had
no
supper
whitney
was
the
real
thing
he
was
a
big
man
with
a
square
jaw
and
eyes
deep
in
under
thick
eyebrows
he
spoke
so
easy
and
friendly
that
you
forgot
how
awful
sharp
and
keen
those
eyes
were
and
how
they
watched
you
all
the
time
you
were
talking
a
young
man
came
with
real
classy
he
introduced
to
me
as
his
son
george
they
couldn
t
have
acted
more
cordial
to
me
and
babbitts
if
we
d
been
the
king
and
queen
of
spain
when
they
sat
down
and
asked
me
to
tell
them
what
i
knew
i
loosened
up
quite
natural
and
told
the
whole
story
the
young
man
sat
sideways
on
the
gold
sofa
smoking
a
cigarette
and
looking
into
the
air
with
his
eyes
narrowed
up
as
if
he
was
spying
at
something
a
long
ways
off
whitney
was
sort
of
slouched
down
in
an
easy
chair
with
his
as
a
woman
over
the
arms
now
and
then
he
d
ask
me
a
begging
my
pardon
for
though
they
were
so
calm
and
quiet
i
could
feel
as
if
it
was
in
the
air
that
they
were
concentrated
close
on
every
word
i
said
when
i
got
through
whitney
said
very
cheerful
as
if
i
d
been
telling
some
yarn
in
a
story
book
that
s
very
interesting
miss
morganthau
and
very
well
told
quite
a
narrative
gift
eh
george
and
he
looked
at
his
son
story
said
george
and
as
careless
as
you
please
flicked
off
his
cigarette
ashes
on
the
rug
whitney
leaned
forward
clasping
his
big
white
hands
between
his
knees
and
looking
into
my
face
but
with
something
terrible
keen
behind
the
smile
how
can
you
be
so
sure
of
the
voice
miss
morganthau
i
don
t
know
whether
on
the
phone
i
could
recognize
the
voice
of
my
own
son
here
you
get
that
way
in
my
work
i
answered
your
ear
gets
trained
for
voices
you
re
absolutely
certain
said
young
whitney
that
in
that
message
you
overheard
the
man
spoke
of
coming
to
the
meeting
place
in
his
auto
yes
sir
i
m
certain
he
said
that
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
father
and
investigations
have
shown
he
had
no
auto
he
telephoned
to
no
other
garage
for
one
he
kept
no
horses
and
to
get
there
on
his
own
feet
would
have
had
to
walk
through
bad
country
roads
a
distance
of
miles
um
answered
old
whitney
as
if
he
wasn
t
interested
and
then
he
said
to
me
in
this
message
you
heard
no
suggestion
was
given
of
what
that
key
was
the
key
of
no
sir
the
man
just
said
it
was
important
and
cokesbury
d
had
the
house
upside
down
looking
for
it
um
said
whitney
again
i
rather
fancy
miss
morganthau
you
ve
done
us
a
double
service
in
hunting
for
a
voice
you
ve
stumbled
on
a
key
young
whitney
laughed
it
s
probably
the
key
of
his
front
door
perhaps
said
his
father
and
looked
down
on
the
carpet
as
if
he
was
thinking
then
babbitts
spoke
up
don
t
criminals
no
matter
how
careful
they
are
often
overlook
some
small
clew
that
maybe
is
the
very
thing
that
gives
them
away
often
said
whitney
in
most
crimes
there
s
a
curious
lack
of
attention
to
detail
the
large
matters
are
well
conceived
and
skillfully
carried
out
and
then
some
minor
point
is
neglected
sometimes
forgotten
sometimes
not
realized
for
its
proper
value
he
got
up
and
shook
himself
like
a
big
bear
and
we
all
rose
to
our
feet
i
was
feeling
pretty
fine
not
only
the
relief
of
having
delivered
the
goods
but
proud
of
myself
for
getting
through
the
interview
so
well
whitney
added
to
it
by
saying
you
re
a
pretty
smart
girl
miss
morganthau
don
t
know
and
don
t
know
yet
the
full
value
of
the
work
you
ve
done
for
me
and
my
client
but
whatever
the
outcome
may
be
you
ve
shown
an
energy
and
keenness
of
mind
that
is
as
surprising
as
it
is
unusual
i
just
swelled
up
with
importance
and
didn
t
know
what
to
say
behind
whitney
i
could
see
babbitts
face
all
beaming
and
grinning
and
i
was
so
glad
he
was
there
to
hear
and
when
i
was
at
the
of
my
george
whitney
who
d
been
silent
for
a
while
said
suddenly
if
you
don
t
mind
me
asking
miss
morganthau
i
d
like
to
know
what
lucky
chance
made
you
listen
in
to
that
conversation
between
miss
hesketh
and
the
unknown
man
believe
me
i
came
down
to
earth
with
a
thud
how
could
i
tell
them
say
i
listened
to
everything
in
the
hope
of
hearing
jack
reddy
talking
to
sylvia
i
looked
down
on
the
floor
feeling
my
cheeks
getting
as
red
as
fire
go
ahead
said
babbitts
don
t
be
afraid
to
say
anything
we
re
as
close
here
as
the
confessional
said
old
whitney
smiling
at
me
like
a
father
i
had
to
say
something
and
took
what
seemed
to
me
the
most
natural
i
d
heard
miss
hesketh
was
a
great
one
for
jollying
up
the
men
and
i
wanted
to
hear
how
she
did
it
and
they
means
babbitts
burst
out
and
good
for
you
miss
morganthau
said
whitney
and
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
gave
it
a
shake
only
i
ll
bet
a
hat
you
didn
t
need
any
teaching
he
turned
to
his
son
and
said
something
about
the
car
being
there
and
then
back
to
me
now
for
a
few
days
miss
morganthau
i
ll
expect
you
to
be
off
duty
in
a
place
accessible
by
telephone
off
duty
i
exclaimed
how
can
i
do
that
he
smiled
in
his
easy
way
and
said
we
ll
attend
to
that
don
t
you
worry
about
it
go
home
and
stay
there
till
you
get
a
call
from
me
if
anyone
asks
what
s
the
matter
say
you
re
ill
and
laid
off
for
a
few
days
don
t
bother
about
reporting
at
the
office
that
ll
be
arranged
and
i
need
hardly
tell
you
not
to
speak
a
word
of
what
you
ve
discovered
or
of
this
interview
here
she
won
t
said
babbitts
i
ll
go
bail
for
that
he
gave
george
whitney
galway
s
telephone
number
and
then
we
shook
hands
all
round
i
was
just
wondering
what
was
the
quickest
way
to
the
ferry
when
whitney
said
the
motor
s
waiting
for
you
and
i
m
sure
babbitts
will
escort
you
to
the
boat
good
night
and
yourself
ready
for
a
call
to
come
to
my
office
the
car
waiting
outside
was
whitney
s
own
gee
it
was
swell
a
footwarmer
and
a
fur
rug
and
a
clock
and
a
bottle
of
salts
for
me
to
sniff
at
i
didn
t
tell
babbitts
i
d
had
no
dinner
for
i
was
ashamed
to
have
the
chauffeur
stop
at
the
kind
of
joints
we
patronize
and
so
i
bore
the
ache
in
my
insides
and
tried
to
believe
the
footwarmer
and
the
salts
made
up
for
it
xiii
at
noon
the
next
was
called
to
galway
s
phone
it
was
george
whitney
telling
me
to
come
over
to
the
city
at
once
i
wasn
t
to
bother
about
addresses
or
finding
my
way
i
d
be
met
at
the
ferry
and
taken
to
whitney
s
office
in
broad
i
was
to
do
was
to
say
nothing
to
anybody
and
come
i
did
both
at
the
ferry
a
chap
came
up
to
me
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
asked
me
if
i
was
miss
morganthau
for
a
moment
i
was
uneasy
thinking
maybe
he
was
a
masher
when
he
turned
to
a
elderly
woman
beside
him
and
said
this
is
cresset
who
s
come
over
on
the
boat
with
you
and
is
going
to
whitney
s
office
too
then
i
knew
it
was
all
right
and
we
three
got
into
a
taxi
on
the
way
across
to
broad
street
he
told
us
what
we
were
to
do
it
was
nothing
much
all
whitney
wanted
of
us
was
that
we
d
sit
in
the
inner
office
and
listen
to
some
gentleman
talking
in
the
next
room
if
we
heard
the
voice
i
d
got
on
the
wire
and
cresset
had
heard
the
night
of
the
murder
we
were
to
say
nothing
but
sit
perfectly
still
till
we
were
called
if
you
recognize
the
voice
make
no
sign
or
sound
all
we
ask
of
you
is
if
you
re
not
certain
of
the
identification
to
say
so
the
office
was
a
great
big
place
rooms
opening
out
of
rooms
and
a
switchboard
with
a
girl
at
it
dressed
very
neat
and
not
noticing
us
as
we
passed
her
george
whitney
met
us
and
took
us
into
a
room
furnished
fine
with
leather
armchairs
and
books
all
up
the
walls
and
a
wide
window
looking
out
over
the
roofs
and
skyscrapers
there
was
a
door
at
one
side
and
this
he
opened
a
crack
and
told
cresset
to
sit
down
close
to
it
with
me
opposite
he
cautioned
us
to
be
quiet
and
not
to
move
or
even
whisper
till
we
were
called
we
sat
there
for
a
while
with
nothing
happening
we
could
hear
voices
and
now
and
then
people
walking
and
doors
shutting
and
once
a
bell
tinkled
far
off
in
the
distance
then
suddenly
i
heard
george
whitney
i
show
him
in
the
private
office
and
heavy
steps
coming
up
the
passage
past
our
door
and
into
the
next
room
then
old
whitney
s
voice
very
loud
and
cheerful
ah
cokesbury
this
is
truly
kind
of
you
i
have
to
apologize
for
taking
up
your
time
just
as
you
re
leaving
too
but
we
hoped
you
might
help
us
in
some
minor
points
of
this
curious
case
the
voice
that
answered
was
cokesbury
s
i
knew
it
well
now
at
the
sound
of
it
cresset
gave
a
start
and
leaned
forward
her
ear
close
to
the
door
he
was
as
cordial
and
hearty
as
if
he
was
at
a
pink
tea
only
too
glad
to
be
of
service
whitney
if
i
had
thought
i
could
be
of
any
help
i
would
have
offered
before
fortunately
for
you
probably
was
held
up
in
my
place
on
the
day
of
the
murder
if
my
car
had
been
in
working
order
i
suppose
i
d
have
been
quite
a
prominent
figure
in
the
case
by
now
he
laughed
out
a
deep
rich
sort
of
laugh
and
it
made
my
flesh
creep
to
think
he
could
do
it
with
that
girl
s
death
at
his
door
the
talk
went
on
for
a
bit
back
and
forth
between
them
whitney
asking
him
some
questions
about
the
roads
the
distances
and
miss
hesketh
s
friends
he
answering
as
calm
and
fluent
as
if
he
d
hardly
known
her
at
all
in
the
middle
of
it
the
clerk
who
had
met
us
at
the
ferry
came
softly
in
and
without
a
word
beckoned
us
to
follow
him
through
a
door
that
led
into
another
room
we
rose
up
as
stealthily
as
burglars
and
stole
across
the
carpet
without
making
so
much
as
a
creak
or
a
rustle
when
we
were
in
he
shut
the
door
told
us
to
wait
there
and
left
us
we
sat
afraid
to
speak
staring
at
each
other
and
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
next
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
opened
and
whitney
came
in
well
he
said
turning
to
me
are
you
as
sure
as
you
were
over
the
phone
certain
i
answered
it
s
the
man
he
looked
at
cresset
how
about
you
cresset
remember
a
mistake
in
a
matter
like
this
is
a
pretty
serious
thing
cresset
was
as
sure
as
i
was
i
couldn
t
tell
the
man
from
adam
she
said
but
i
knew
his
voice
the
minute
i
heard
it
very
well
now
i
want
you
to
come
into
the
private
office
don
t
be
frightened
nothing
disagreeable
s
going
to
happen
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
answer
simply
and
truthfully
any
questions
i
may
put
to
you
come
along
we
followed
him
up
the
passage
to
the
room
where
he
d
been
talking
sitting
in
a
large
chair
by
the
desk
was
the
man
i
d
seen
that
day
in
the
woods
with
sylvia
hesketh
he
didn
t
look
so
robust
and
hearty
as
he
had
then
his
skin
was
paler
and
his
forehead
lined
but
i
noticed
his
large
coarse
hands
with
the
hair
on
murderer
s
were
the
same
when
he
saw
us
walking
in
solemn
behind
whitney
his
face
changed
it
s
hard
to
explain
how
it
looked
but
it
was
as
if
the
muscles
tightened
up
and
the
eyes
got
a
fixed
startled
expression
like
you
see
in
the
eyes
of
an
animal
you
ve
come
on
sudden
and
scared
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
i
saw
one
of
his
hands
close
till
the
knuckles
turned
white
george
whitney
who
was
standing
near
by
watched
him
like
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
old
whitney
spoke
up
as
genial
as
if
he
was
introducing
us
at
a
party
these
ladies
cokesbury
come
from
longwood
and
its
vicinity
miss
morganthau
is
one
of
the
operators
in
the
telephone
exchange
and
cresset
you
ve
met
before
i
think
one
night
at
cresset
s
farm
cresset
bowed
very
polite
and
made
as
if
she
was
going
to
shake
hands
but
cokesbury
didn
t
meet
her
half
or
a
quarter
way
he
turned
to
the
men
guess
he
did
it
without
like
lightning
from
one
to
the
sort
of
wild
glance
they
never
took
their
eyes
off
him
and
there
was
something
awful
about
their
stare
for
all
both
of
them
were
behaving
so
pleasant
under
that
stare
he
got
as
white
as
a
sheet
but
he
tried
to
put
up
a
bluff
cresset
he
said
cresset
there
s
some
mistake
i
never
saw
her
before
in
my
life
that
s
quite
true
said
whitney
you
didn
t
see
her
nor
she
you
if
you
remember
it
was
very
dark
but
you
spoke
to
her
and
she
s
willing
to
swear
that
yours
was
the
voice
she
heard
aren
t
you
mrs
cresset
yes
sir
said
cresset
as
solid
and
sure
as
the
bartholdi
statue
this
is
the
gentleman
that
asked
me
the
way
that
night
i
d
know
his
voice
among
a
thousand
what
night
said
cokesbury
i
don
t
know
what
she
s
talking
about
it
was
pitiful
to
see
him
trying
to
keep
it
up
with
his
face
gray
and
his
hands
trembling
whitney
went
on
as
if
he
didn
t
notice
anything
and
miss
morganthau
here
is
also
ready
to
swear
to
your
voice
as
the
one
she
overheard
on
the
phone
saturday
november
the
twentieth
in
a
conversation
with
the
late
miss
message
you
ve
probably
seen
a
good
deal
about
in
the
papers
i
saw
one
of
those
big
hairy
hands
make
a
grip
at
the
back
of
the
armchair
i
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
and
couldn
t
take
my
eyes
off
him
till
whitney
turned
to
me
and
said
in
that
bland
society
way
perhaps
you
ll
be
so
good
miss
morganthau
as
to
tell
cokesbury
of
your
efforts
during
the
past
week
to
get
him
on
the
phone
i
told
him
the
whole
thing
and
ended
up
with
the
story
of
how
i
fooled
him
about
the
key
and
honest
to
god
though
i
thought
i
was
talking
to
a
murderer
i
was
sorry
for
him
all
the
life
seemed
to
leave
him
and
he
got
as
haggard
as
an
old
man
with
his
lips
shaking
and
the
perspiration
in
beads
on
his
forehead
when
i
got
through
he
suddenly
gave
a
sort
of
groan
dropped
back
into
his
chair
and
put
his
hands
over
his
face
i
was
glad
it
was
hidden
and
i
was
glad
when
whitney
turned
to
me
and
cresset
and
said
quick
and
commanding
that
ll
do
you
can
go
into
the
other
room
ring
the
bell
george
we
huddled
out
into
the
passage
where
we
met
that
spry
clerk
coming
up
on
the
jump
he
went
into
the
office
and
shut
the
door
and
we
could
hear
a
murmur
of
voices
we
standing
up
against
the
wall
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
presently
the
clerk
came
out
again
rounded
us
up
and
sent
us
into
the
room
down
the
hall
where
whitney
had
talked
to
us
he
told
us
to
wait
there
for
a
minute
then
lit
out
as
if
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
we
stood
stiff
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
expecting
to
hear
the
tramp
of
policemen
and
then
cokesbury
being
dragged
off
to
jail
but
it
was
all
very
still
i
never
supposed
when
you
caught
a
criminal
the
proceedings
would
be
so
natural
and
dignified
after
a
while
the
clerk
came
back
he
said
whitney
d
sent
us
his
thanks
for
our
kindness
in
never
saw
people
waste
so
many
words
on
hoped
we
d
excuse
him
from
thanking
us
in
person
but
he
was
just
now
very
busy
he
warned
us
not
to
say
a
word
to
anyone
of
what
had
transpired
and
then
a
boy
coming
to
the
door
and
saying
it
s
here
he
told
us
a
taxi
was
waiting
below
to
take
us
to
the
ferry
if
we
couldn
t
talk
to
anyone
else
we
could
to
each
other
and
i
guess
we
did
more
gabbing
going
down
in
the
taxi
and
across
in
the
boat
than
cresset
had
done
for
years
she
told
me
about
the
night
when
cokesbury
had
come
to
her
house
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
luck
was
with
way
it
sometimes
is
with
sinners
usually
at
that
hour
she
was
round
in
the
kitchen
and
when
he
knocked
would
have
opened
the
door
and
seen
his
face
in
the
lamplight
but
she
d
gone
upstairs
early
as
her
little
daughter
had
a
cold
to
go
back
over
the
small
things
that
happened
would
make
you
sure
some
evil
power
was
protecting
him
that
morning
the
little
girl
s
cold
wasn
t
bad
and
she
d
gone
to
school
as
usual
but
at
the
schoolhouse
she
heard
that
the
dancing
one
i
saw
in
longwood
which
had
been
performing
along
the
pike
on
its
way
back
to
been
at
jaycock
s
farm
and
might
be
round
by
cresset
s
that
afternoon
like
all
children
she
was
crazy
about
the
bear
and
after
school
hours
she
and
a
chum
slipped
off
and
stood
around
in
the
damp
waiting
but
the
bear
did
not
show
up
and
when
she
came
home
crying
with
disappointment
the
cold
was
heavy
on
her
her
mother
bundled
her
off
to
bed
and
went
up
early
to
sit
with
her
only
for
that
cokesbury
would
probably
have
been
landed
in
jail
weeks
before
the
state
saved
money
and
two
innocent
men
saved
shame
and
suffering
that
s
the
way
it
is
with
the
devil
s
own
i
said
i
guess
he
takes
care
of
them
for
a
while
jollies
them
along
the
downward
path
it
looks
like
that
was
the
case
said
cresset
her
kind
rosy
face
very
solemn
but
the
power
of
evil
gets
broke
in
the
end
murder
will
out
s
true
if
anything
is
think
of
that
man
feeling
so
safe
and
every
hour
the
cords
tightening
round
him
and
did
it
said
i
awful
proud
we
found
the
cords
and
then
pulled
on
them
we
did
says
she
i
never
thought
to
be
the
one
to
put
a
behind
bars
but
i
have
and
my
conscience
tells
me
i
ve
done
right
my
but
we
both
felt
chesty
the
next
morning
babbitts
phoned
me
to
say
he
d
be
over
sunday
evening
the
information
of
our
suspect
would
be
given
to
the
press
sunday
morning
for
the
monday
papers
and
after
it
was
in
he
d
come
across
and
tell
me
about
it
whitney
had
arranged
for
me
not
to
go
back
to
work
till
tuesday
and
though
i
suppose
the
rest
was
good
for
me
the
strain
of
waiting
wore
on
me
something
dreadful
i
kept
wondering
how
cokesbury
had
done
it
and
how
he
was
going
to
explain
this
and
account
for
that
most
of
sunday
i
lay
on
the
bed
trying
to
read
a
novel
but
a
great
deal
more
interested
in
the
hands
of
the
clock
than
i
was
in
the
printed
pages
when
it
began
to
darken
up
for
evening
i
told
galway
i
was
expecting
a
gentleman
caller
and
asked
for
the
loan
of
the
parlor
she
s
a
great
one
for
love
affairs
and
it
always
discouraged
her
that
i
had
no
regular
company
now
she
thought
i
d
got
a
steady
at
last
and
wanted
to
lend
me
her
cameo
pin
and
decked
up
the
parlor
as
if
the
minister
was
coming
to
call
with
the
leather
cushion
and
the
tablecloth
long
before
babbitts
was
due
i
was
sitting
by
the
stove
burning
bright
and
clear
with
the
drop
light
throwing
a
glow
over
the
center
table
upstairs
i
could
hear
galway
tramping
round
as
she
went
to
bed
which
was
considerate
of
her
as
she
was
something
of
a
night
bird
when
i
heard
his
knock
at
the
side
door
i
gave
a
sort
of
squeal
of
excitement
and
ran
to
let
him
in
well
i
said
grabbing
his
arm
too
worked
up
to
say
good
evening
has
he
confessed
yes
he
said
he
has
and
he
s
told
an
uncommon
queer
story
he
killed
her
that
s
the
queerest
part
of
it
said
babbitts
slowly
he
didn
t
xiv
now
i
don
t
believe
if
i
gave
you
twenty
guesses
you
d
know
what
i
did
when
i
heard
those
out
crying
it
wasn
t
because
i
wanted
cokesbury
to
be
executed
it
wasn
t
because
i
wanted
the
reward
it
wasn
t
even
that
i
was
so
crazy
to
have
jack
reddy
was
just
because
i
was
so
i
couldn
t
seem
to
bear
it
i
cried
so
hard
i
didn
t
know
what
i
was
doing
and
i
suppose
that
s
the
reason
i
leaned
on
babbitts
shoulder
it
being
the
nearest
thing
handy
he
brought
me
to
my
senses
patting
me
on
the
arm
and
saying
sort
of
soothing
as
if
he
was
comforting
a
child
who
d
broken
her
doll
there
t
ll
be
all
right
soon
we
ll
get
the
right
man
don
t
take
it
to
heart
that
way
then
i
began
to
laugh
for
it
did
seem
so
crying
because
cokesbury
wasn
t
a
murderer
and
babbitts
telling
me
not
to
take
it
to
heart
as
if
i
d
been
disappointed
in
not
seeing
the
electrocution
the
laughter
and
tears
got
mixed
up
together
and
i
don
t
know
where
i
d
have
landed
if
i
hadn
t
seen
he
was
getting
frightened
and
wanted
to
call
galway
that
pulled
me
up
and
i
got
a
hold
on
myself
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
sitting
side
by
side
in
front
of
the
stove
the
storm
over
all
but
a
little
hiccupy
kind
of
sob
that
came
upon
me
unexpected
at
intervals
for
the
next
hour
we
sat
there
without
moving
while
babbitts
told
me
cokesbury
s
story
i
ll
put
down
what
he
said
as
near
his
words
as
i
can
remember
it
the
way
he
told
it
was
better
than
any
of
the
newspaper
accounts
even
his
though
he
got
a
raise
of
salary
for
the
way
he
d
handled
it
cokesbury
says
he
didn
t
kill
sylvia
hesketh
and
i
believe
him
and
so
do
the
whitneys
besides
the
corroborative
evidence
is
absolutely
convincing
he
s
not
a
murderer
but
he
s
a
good
at
that
explains
why
he
didn
t
come
out
after
the
crime
and
tell
what
he
knew
instead
he
got
in
a
panic
lost
what
little
nerve
he
had
and
was
skipping
out
to
europe
when
you
nabbed
him
he
was
in
love
with
sylvia
hesketh
if
you
call
that
sort
of
thing
love
anyway
instead
of
being
simply
what
you
might
describe
as
a
beau
of
hers
he
was
mad
about
her
i
fancy
even
she
poor
girl
didn
t
realize
the
passion
she
d
kindled
but
was
like
a
child
playing
with
a
dynamite
bomb
it
appears
she
saw
more
of
him
than
anybody
guessed
after
the
first
flirtation
at
bar
harbor
he
came
down
to
cokesbury
lodge
nearly
every
sunday
and
used
to
meet
her
in
the
woods
and
on
the
side
roads
and
make
dates
with
her
for
theaters
and
concerts
in
town
he
kept
it
quiet
for
he
knew
without
being
told
that
the
doctor
wouldn
t
stand
for
it
his
hope
was
that
willful
and
unstable
as
he
knew
her
to
be
he
d
eventually
win
her
by
his
persistence
and
devotion
it
was
one
of
those
situations
that
may
end
in
nothing
or
may
end
as
this
one
did
in
a
tragedy
the
girl
was
foolhardy
and
flirtatious
the
man
infatuated
very
quickly
he
got
on
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
the
only
victim
of
her
beauty
and
her
wiles
he
watched
and
questioned
and
found
out
about
the
other
men
of
them
he
soon
saw
that
reddy
was
the
favored
one
and
a
deadly
jealousy
seized
him
for
reddy
might
have
attracted
any
woman
when
he
tried
to
find
out
from
her
how
she
stood
with
reddy
he
could
get
no
satisfaction
she
d
tell
him
one
thing
one
day
and
another
the
next
she
kept
them
all
guessing
but
it
didn
t
mean
to
any
of
the
others
what
it
meant
to
cokesbury
all
through
october
he
spied
and
queried
and
learnt
that
she
was
meeting
reddy
in
his
car
and
going
off
for
long
jaunts
with
him
he
says
he
was
half
mad
with
jealousy
and
fear
but
he
hid
it
from
her
that
s
the
way
things
were
when
he
sent
the
phone
message
that
you
caught
you
sized
him
up
just
right
when
she
told
him
she
had
a
date
that
was
a
secret
he
got
a
premonition
of
the
truth
the
way
a
man
does
when
his
reason
is
under
the
dominion
of
his
emotions
he
felt
certain
she
was
going
off
with
reddy
and
the
brakes
that
he
d
kept
down
till
then
were
lifted
he
determined
he
d
find
out
and
if
it
was
true
stop
them
if
the
skies
fell
and
now
here
comes
the
queer
part
of
the
story
if
anybody
d
guessed
it
a
lot
of
things
that
were
dark
would
have
been
as
clear
as
daylight
he
keep
the
date
you
heard
him
make
on
the
phone
how
could
he
he
had
no
car
or
horse
or
anything
only
part
of
that
s
had
no
car
or
horse
but
he
have
something
what
an
aeroplane
i
fell
back
staring
at
him
an
cokesbury
lodge
in
the
garage
there
why
he
wouldn
t
rent
the
house
why
he
kept
going
down
over
sunday
all
summer
the
year
he
was
in
france
he
d
done
a
lot
of
flying
and
was
fascinated
by
it
before
he
left
there
he
was
an
expert
aviator
but
his
wife
hated
it
and
it
was
one
of
their
grounds
of
dissension
after
she
died
he
had
a
machine
brought
down
in
sections
set
it
up
himself
and
kept
it
in
the
garage
not
a
soul
knew
it
he
only
flew
at
night
for
he
wanted
it
kept
a
secret
for
s
the
best
thing
i
ve
heard
about
carried
a
heavy
life
insurance
policy
secured
to
his
children
cokesbury
s
not
a
rich
man
though
he
has
a
good
business
and
if
he
died
his
children
would
have
had
to
live
on
what
their
mother
left
them
which
wasn
t
much
if
it
was
known
that
he
was
aviating
the
policy
would
have
been
invalidated
so
he
indulged
his
secret
passion
at
night
the
isolated
position
of
the
house
made
it
easy
to
escape
detection
and
his
machine
was
equipped
with
a
very
silent
muffler
no
one
had
a
glimmering
of
it
not
even
sylvia
the
phone
message
you
heard
was
sent
from
the
station
at
jersey
city
and
when
he
sent
it
he
intend
coming
to
mapleshade
in
his
motor
when
he
got
to
azalea
and
found
the
car
unmended
in
the
garage
he
flew
into
a
rage
as
he
thought
his
plans
were
blocked
alone
in
the
lodge
ravaged
by
jealousy
he
lost
all
caution
and
decided
to
take
out
the
aeroplane
you
remember
that
there
was
a
moon
that
night
but
that
in
the
evening
the
skies
were
clouded
and
the
air
breathless
the
darkness
and
the
weather
were
on
his
side
and
he
came
down
in
a
field
about
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
house
closing
the
as
he
descended
he
was
early
and
hid
himself
among
some
trees
where
he
could
watch
the
front
door
he
says
it
was
while
he
was
waiting
there
for
her
that
the
idea
came
to
him
of
frustrating
an
elopement
by
carrying
her
off
he
was
laying
round
in
his
mind
how
he
would
get
the
truth
from
her
when
he
saw
her
come
out
and
gave
a
low
whistle
she
heard
it
and
came
toward
him
it
was
not
till
she
was
close
to
him
and
he
could
see
the
outlines
of
her
figure
through
the
dark
that
he
made
out
a
bag
in
her
hand
he
knew
for
certain
she
was
going
and
decided
on
his
course
in
all
his
other
dealings
with
her
he
had
found
her
subtle
and
evasive
now
perhaps
because
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
decided
on
a
positive
action
she
went
straight
to
the
point
without
any
preamble
she
told
him
what
she
was
going
to
do
and
that
within
a
reddy
would
be
waiting
for
her
in
the
lane
he
showed
no
anger
or
surprise
apparently
accepting
the
situation
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
he
says
he
thought
she
was
relieved
having
expected
a
scene
with
him
when
he
had
disarmed
her
of
her
suspicions
he
told
her
of
the
airship
and
asked
her
if
she
wouldn
t
like
to
come
up
for
a
spin
before
reddy
arrived
they
had
over
half
an
hour
and
he
could
take
her
for
a
short
flight
and
would
bring
her
down
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
everybody
agrees
that
she
was
a
bold
venturesome
girl
and
the
idea
appealed
to
her
as
she
had
never
been
up
they
walked
quickly
through
the
fields
and
bit
of
woodland
to
the
aeroplane
she
was
in
high
spirits
as
she
tucked
herself
in
he
could
hear
her
laughter
as
he
took
his
seat
and
then
closing
the
they
soared
up
they
rose
two
thousand
feet
he
then
he
headed
east
they
were
winging
their
way
over
cokesbury
lodge
on
toward
the
hills
in
the
distance
when
reddy
must
have
sighted
the
lights
of
longwood
as
he
came
down
the
firehill
road
cokesbury
swears
he
had
no
intention
of
kidnapping
her
he
says
he
had
no
definite
idea
of
where
he
was
going
that
his
plan
was
simply
to
get
her
away
from
reddy
and
put
an
end
to
the
marriage
personally
i
don
t
believe
him
i
think
he
had
a
perfectly
clear
idea
of
carrying
her
off
to
cokesbury
lodge
and
that
his
chivalrous
scheme
was
to
put
her
into
such
a
compromising
position
she
would
be
willing
to
marry
him
maybe
i
m
don
t
know
anyway
he
very
soon
saw
you
can
t
abduct
a
girl
against
her
will
after
about
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
he
was
conscious
of
her
getting
uneasy
and
speaking
to
that
he
couldn
t
hear
but
that
he
knew
to
be
at
first
startled
questions
then
angry
commands
he
shouted
replies
but
the
great
machine
kept
steadily
on
its
way
neither
turning
nor
dipping
downward
then
she
realized
and
broke
into
a
fury
turning
upon
him
in
the
dark
putting
her
face
close
to
his
and
screaming
for
him
to
bring
her
down
the
noise
made
it
impossible
to
argue
with
her
and
fearful
of
what
she
might
do
he
held
her
off
with
his
elbow
the
delicately
balanced
machine
swaying
as
she
seized
his
arm
and
shook
it
lunging
up
against
him
her
cries
of
rage
rising
above
the
thunder
of
the
screw
can
t
you
imagine
it
the
big
ship
sailing
through
the
night
with
the
lights
of
farms
and
little
towns
sliding
by
far
below
and
above
the
sky
muffled
deep
in
black
clouds
poised
between
them
the
man
and
woman
each
gripped
by
a
different
there
like
two
naked
souls
in
a
sort
of
elemental
battle
of
the
sexes
he
admits
he
was
scared
and
if
he
could
have
spoken
to
her
would
have
pacified
her
with
all
sorts
of
assurances
but
speech
was
out
of
the
question
and
when
she
made
a
sudden
lunge
across
him
for
the
wheel
he
realized
she
would
kill
them
both
if
he
didn
t
bring
her
to
earth
throwing
her
back
with
a
blow
of
his
elbow
he
yelled
that
he
was
coming
down
and
as
she
felt
the
machine
begin
its
glancing
downward
glide
she
fell
back
into
her
place
suddenly
quiet
then
leaned
forward
scanning
the
country
below
them
a
momentary
break
of
the
clouds
let
a
little
light
spill
through
and
by
this
he
saw
a
bare
bold
landscape
darkened
by
woods
and
with
the
gleam
of
a
large
body
of
water
to
the
right
showing
against
the
blackness
like
polished
steel
he
made
a
landing
in
an
open
space
an
uncultivated
field
with
a
hillock
in
the
center
covered
with
grass
and
surrounded
by
trees
the
water
had
drained
off
this
and
it
was
quite
dry
she
was
hardly
out
on
the
ground
and
he
was
preparing
for
an
explanation
when
to
his
surprise
she
curtly
told
him
to
follow
her
and
led
the
way
along
a
ridge
that
skirted
the
lake
this
too
was
dry
a
fact
curiously
in
his
favor
for
their
feet
left
no
tracks
the
grass
closing
on
the
trail
they
swept
through
it
she
did
not
address
him
again
till
the
dim
shape
of
a
house
appearing
he
asked
her
if
she
was
going
there
and
she
answered
in
the
same
curt
way
yes
she
was
cold
a
wharf
jutted
out
in
front
of
the
house
and
in
stepping
from
the
grass
to
the
planks
he
made
a
motion
to
help
her
but
she
started
away
from
him
as
if
he
was
a
snake
making
two
or
three
steps
into
the
liquid
mud
that
ran
up
to
the
wharf
s
edge
it
was
then
he
thought
she
dropped
the
glove
once
again
on
the
planks
she
took
a
key
from
her
purse
fitted
it
in
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
the
room
was
pitch
dark
and
cokesbury
stood
in
the
doorway
while
she
went
in
she
moved
about
as
if
she
was
accustomed
to
the
place
lit
a
lamp
set
a
match
to
the
fire
already
laid
and
gave
him
a
copper
kettle
to
fill
with
water
from
the
lake
when
he
came
back
with
it
the
table
was
set
out
with
tea
things
and
the
fire
was
leaping
up
the
chimney
she
hung
the
kettle
on
a
crane
swung
it
over
the
flames
and
then
turning
to
him
said
do
you
know
where
you
are
he
said
he
didn
t
and
she
answered
re
in
jack
reddy
s
bungalow
at
hochalaga
lake
the
place
where
i
ve
spent
the
happiest
days
of
my
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
and
she
smiled
scornfully
back
at
him
fool
she
said
to
think
you
could
come
blundering
in
and
stop
me
from
marrying
the
only
man
of
all
of
you
who
s
worth
a
she
made
tea
and
then
motioned
him
to
sit
down
by
the
table
taking
a
seat
at
the
other
side
facing
each
other
in
the
lamplight
they
had
a
conversation
that
put
an
end
to
all
his
dreams
for
the
first
time
in
his
acquaintance
with
her
he
thought
she
spoke
frankly
she
told
him
of
her
friendship
with
reddy
from
the
start
and
how
the
doctor
s
senseless
opposition
had
fanned
a
flirtation
into
a
passionate
love
affair
when
the
quarrels
began
at
mapleshade
they
found
that
they
could
meet
without
fear
of
detection
at
the
lake
she
going
out
there
in
her
car
and
he
in
his
she
had
her
own
key
and
often
during
the
autumn
she
had
gone
to
the
bungalow
in
the
morning
reddy
had
joined
her
and
they
had
spent
the
day
together
canoeing
and
fishing
on
the
lake
cooking
a
picnic
meal
over
the
fire
and
driving
home
in
the
afternoon
the
racer
towing
her
car
till
they
came
to
the
turnpike
cokesbury
says
he
thinks
at
first
it
was
only
the
spirit
of
romance
and
adventure
which
made
her
do
such
a
rash
thing
but
that
in
the
end
reddy
s
devotion
and
chivalrous
attitude
made
a
deep
impression
on
her
and
she
came
as
near
loving
him
as
she
could
any
man
he
says
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
meetings
were
perfectly
innocent
and
that
reddy
had
behaved
from
the
start
as
a
gentleman
whether
she
really
loved
him
or
not
he
said
he
d
taught
her
to
respect
they
talked
for
over
an
hour
taking
the
tea
she
had
made
and
cokesbury
smoking
a
cigar
he
remembered
leaving
the
butt
in
the
saucer
of
his
cup
it
was
eight
when
they
rose
to
go
sylvia
put
out
the
lamp
but
the
fire
was
still
burning
and
the
tea
things
were
left
on
the
table
cokesbury
says
he
promised
to
take
her
home
that
he
saw
his
case
was
hopeless
and
he
d
made
up
his
mind
to
have
done
with
her
forever
the
sky
was
clouded
over
and
it
was
as
dark
as
a
pocket
when
they
went
back
to
the
aeroplane
he
had
to
direct
the
machine
by
guesswork
the
country
black
below
him
and
the
sky
black
above
he
swears
that
he
intended
to
take
her
back
to
mapleshade
and
i
believe
him
no
even
a
bad
egg
like
to
run
away
with
a
woman
who
hands
out
the
line
of
talk
that
girl
had
in
the
bungalow
anyway
we
ve
only
his
word
for
the
statement
that
he
completely
lost
his
bearings
he
could
see
no
lights
and
after
making
an
exploratory
circle
realized
he
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
which
way
to
go
to
make
matters
worse
he
could
hear
from
shouted
remarks
of
hers
that
her
suspicions
were
on
the
alert
and
that
she
was
ready
to
flare
up
again
by
this
time
there
wasn
t
much
of
the
lover
left
in
him
according
to
his
own
words
he
was
as
anxious
to
get
her
home
again
as
she
was
to
be
there
with
his
head
clear
and
his
blood
cold
he
did
not
relish
a
second
flight
with
a
woman
fighting
like
a
wildcat
this
was
the
angry
and
disbelieving
he
scared
and
unable
to
conciliate
the
twinkle
of
a
light
caught
his
eye
and
he
decided
to
come
down
and
ask
his
way
they
dropped
into
a
stretch
of
grass
land
among
fields
with
the
light
shining
some
way
off
through
a
screen
of
trees
farther
away
just
a
spark
he
saw
another
light
he
told
her
to
wait
while
he
went
to
inquire
and
walked
off
toward
the
one
that
was
nearest
it
was
cresset
s
farm
there
he
had
the
interview
with
cresset
telling
her
he
had
an
auto
in
order
to
explain
his
presence
when
he
went
back
he
found
that
sylvia
had
disappeared
at
first
he
didn
t
know
what
to
do
realizing
that
if
the
story
of
their
flight
got
abroad
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
he
was
certain
she
had
disbelieved
him
and
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
get
away
from
him
she
was
either
hiding
or
had
gone
for
the
second
light
this
being
the
most
plausible
he
walked
toward
a
distance
across
fields
and
through
brought
up
at
a
ramshackle
wayside
arbor
he
stole
round
from
the
back
to
a
side
window
and
there
through
a
crack
in
the
shutter
looked
in
and
saw
sylvia
talking
to
hines
he
says
he
stayed
there
for
some
minutes
afraid
if
he
went
in
after
her
she
would
make
a
scene
and
start
a
scandal
then
his
eyes
fell
on
the
telephone
booth
and
he
felt
sure
she
had
telephoned
either
to
her
own
home
or
to
reddy
her
air
of
was
sitting
by
the
stove
with
her
feet
on
its
lower
him
in
this
and
he
decided
to
let
her
alone
he
went
back
to
the
aeroplane
wondering
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
whole
crazy
escapade
he
says
he
felt
confident
of
her
cleverness
to
hush
the
thing
up
but
he
was
uneasy
his
discomfort
wasn
t
lessened
when
he
found
that
she
had
left
her
bag
in
the
machine
and
on
his
way
home
one
of
the
things
that
preoccupied
him
was
thinking
up
the
best
way
of
getting
the
bag
back
to
her
monday
morning
he
went
to
town
in
a
state
of
suspense
if
she
should
tell
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
and
he
was
on
the
alert
for
a
visit
from
the
doctor
or
even
reddy
but
the
day
passed
without
any
sign
of
trouble
and
he
was
just
calming
down
thinking
she
had
either
found
reddy
and
gone
with
him
or
invented
some
story
to
quiet
the
mapleshade
people
when
he
read
of
the
murder
in
the
evening
paper
you
better
believe
he
was
frightened
he
knew
the
bag
was
hidden
in
his
room
at
the
lodge
and
that
as
far
as
he
could
tell
not
a
soul
had
seen
the
airship
as
to
cresset
he
felt
safe
for
she
couldn
t
possibly
have
made
out
a
feature
in
the
darkness
but
i
cried
out
why
if
he
hadn
t
done
that
s
all
right
babbitts
interrupted
he
hadn
t
done
it
but
i
tell
you
he
was
a
coward
he
was
in
a
sweat
for
fear
of
being
suspected
of
being
pulled
in
as
a
witness
of
his
reputation
his
business
his
position
he
wanted
to
keep
out
of
it
at
any
cost
what
a
cur
i
said
oh
he
s
that
and
more
and
he
s
ready
to
admit
it
himself
but
it
wasn
t
as
smooth
sailing
as
he
thought
it
would
be
after
the
inquest
he
read
of
the
overheard
phone
message
and
that
brought
him
up
with
a
jolt
he
got
in
a
state
of
terror
realizing
too
late
that
his
silence
was
more
incriminating
than
any
confession
every
day
his
fears
grew
worse
he
wouldn
t
answer
any
phone
calls
faking
up
reasons
to
his
clerks
and
his
servants
finally
it
got
on
his
nerves
so
he
couldn
t
stand
it
and
he
made
ready
to
skip
to
europe
the
key
was
what
tripped
him
up
do
you
remember
whitney
saying
how
criminals
overlooked
important
details
well
what
he
overlooked
was
the
key
of
the
garage
in
his
preoccupation
on
monday
morning
he
had
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
the
raincoat
he
was
accustomed
to
leave
in
the
auto
and
had
simply
forgotten
it
then
when
he
went
to
pack
his
things
he
couldn
t
find
it
hunted
in
a
nervous
frenzy
and
finally
had
his
man
telephone
over
to
miner
s
place
you
and
the
key
were
the
combination
that
beat
him
but
jack
reddy
i
said
was
he
going
to
slink
off
and
let
him
be
tried
for
the
murder
when
he
could
have
cleared
it
all
up
he
not
and
i
guess
the
fellow
s
not
as
yellow
as
to
have
stood
by
and
let
an
innocent
man
go
to
his
death
he
says
there
wasn
t
enough
evidence
to
convict
reddy
and
if
things
had
gone
badly
he
would
have
come
out
and
told
what
he
knew
and
i
think
that
s
we
ll
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
how
can
you
be
so
sure
how
do
you
know
he
s
the
murderer
after
all
oh
there
s
no
doubt
everything
fits
in
too
well
the
police
were
out
at
cokesbury
lodge
on
saturday
and
saw
the
aeroplane
and
found
miss
hesketh
s
bag
both
the
and
son
who
ve
had
a
vast
experience
in
this
sort
of
there
s
no
question
of
his
innocence
we
sat
silent
for
a
spell
looking
at
the
stove
then
i
said
we
re
back
just
where
we
were
in
the
beginning
babbitts
leaned
forward
and
shook
down
some
ashes
the
case
is
but
we
re
not
he
said
how
do
you
make
that
out
i
asked
six
weeks
ago
we
didn
t
know
each
other
and
now
we
re
friends
that
s
so
i
said
and
we
both
sat
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
red
eye
of
the
stove
xv
cokesbury
s
story
made
a
great
sensation
even
if
it
didn
t
bring
us
any
nearer
to
finding
the
murderer
it
explained
the
mystery
of
sylvia
s
movements
up
to
the
time
she
appeared
in
the
wayside
arbor
and
it
cleared
jack
reddy
babbitts
told
me
that
the
whitneys
were
doing
some
legal
won
t
tell
what
they
were
for
i
d
never
get
them
have
him
liberated
and
that
they
would
soon
issue
a
statement
to
the
press
when
it
came
out
everybody
saw
why
he
had
said
such
contradictory
things
about
those
seven
hours
on
the
road
babbitts
and
i
had
guessed
right
when
we
thought
he
was
holding
something
back
and
when
i
heard
why
i
was
grateful
to
him
yes
grateful
that
s
the
word
and
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
use
it
he
was
my
hero
and
he
stayed
a
hero
didn
t
fall
down
and
disappoint
me
but
made
me
know
there
were
people
in
the
world
who
could
stick
to
their
standard
no
matter
happened
don
t
you
think
that
s
a
thing
to
be
grateful
for
the
reason
he
didn
t
tell
was
to
protect
the
memory
of
that
poor
dead
girl
who
couldn
t
rise
up
and
protect
herself
he
knew
what
wicked
lies
would
be
told
and
believed
and
he
was
going
to
shield
her
in
death
as
he
would
have
in
life
that
night
after
he
had
searched
the
roads
he
suddenly
thought
that
in
some
wild
freak
she
had
gone
to
the
bungalow
in
her
own
car
and
phoned
him
from
there
as
soon
as
the
idea
entered
his
head
he
went
out
to
the
lake
one
glance
showed
him
someone
had
been
there
before
room
was
warm
the
fire
still
smouldering
on
the
hearth
he
lit
the
light
and
saw
the
two
teacups
and
the
cigar
butt
on
the
saucer
he
examined
the
doors
and
windows
and
found
that
they
were
locked
and
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
having
broken
in
the
only
person
beside
himself
who
had
a
key
to
the
bungalow
was
sylvia
then
he
knew
she
had
been
there
with
another
man
and
one
of
those
fierce
rages
came
on
him
for
a
spell
he
was
outside
himself
he
thought
of
things
that
never
happened
the
way
people
do
in
a
sylvia
sending
him
the
phone
message
with
the
other
man
standing
by
and
laughing
he
tore
her
letters
out
of
the
desk
and
threw
them
in
the
fire
and
smashed
the
tea
things
against
the
side
of
the
house
he
was
half
crazy
thinking
himself
fooled
and
made
a
mock
of
by
the
woman
he
had
loved
when
his
rage
quieted
down
he
sat
brooding
over
the
fire
for
a
long
time
it
was
moonlight
when
he
left
bright
enough
for
him
to
fill
the
tank
he
had
never
thought
about
any
inquiries
for
the
missing
drum
till
at
the
inquest
the
question
of
the
gasoline
was
sprung
on
him
then
he
lied
feeling
certain
that
no
one
would
ever
go
out
to
the
lake
it
was
his
intention
to
go
there
himself
hide
the
drum
and
clear
out
the
cottage
but
he
put
it
off
hating
to
go
near
the
place
if
pat
donahue
hadn
t
gone
there
to
fish
through
the
thing
no
one
would
have
dreamed
secret
of
the
bungalow
would
never
have
been
discovered
one
of
the
features
of
the
case
that
he
couldn
t
understand
and
that
he
spent
the
days
in
jail
speculating
about
was
how
she
had
reached
the
lake
the
mud
showed
the
tracks
of
only
one
auto
his
own
he
could
find
no
solution
to
this
mystery
and
he
could
speak
to
no
one
about
it
whatever
happened
to
him
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
would
never
give
her
up
to
the
and
who
would
blacken
and
tear
to
pieces
all
that
was
left
of
her
he
was
liberated
and
believe
me
longwood
rejoiced
it
was
as
if
a
king
who
had
been
banished
had
come
back
to
his
throne
i
don
t
think
he
was
home
two
days
when
he
telephoned
in
asking
me
if
he
could
come
to
see
me
and
thank
me
for
what
i
d
done
wasn
t
that
like
him
most
men
would
have
been
so
glad
to
get
out
of
jail
they
d
have
forgotten
the
hello
girl
who
d
helped
to
free
them
but
not
jack
reddy
he
came
in
the
late
afternoon
at
the
time
i
got
off
i
ll
never
forget
it
katie
reilly
was
at
the
switchboard
and
i
was
standing
at
the
window
watching
when
i
saw
the
two
lights
of
the
gray
racer
coming
down
the
street
i
ran
and
opened
the
wasn
t
bashful
a
when
i
saw
him
i
gave
a
little
cry
for
he
looked
so
changed
pale
and
haggard
and
older
a
good
many
years
older
but
his
smile
was
the
same
and
so
was
the
kind
honest
look
of
his
face
before
he
said
a
word
he
just
held
out
his
hand
and
mine
went
into
it
and
i
felt
the
clasp
of
his
fingers
warm
and
strong
it
is
but
wasn
t
any
more
like
the
girl
who
used
to
tremble
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
but
was
calm
and
quiet
looking
deep
and
steady
into
his
eyes
as
if
we
d
got
to
be
friends
the
way
a
man
might
be
friends
with
a
boy
miss
morganthau
he
said
i
ve
heard
what
you
ve
done
and
i
want
to
thank
you
you
needn
t
have
taken
all
the
trouble
to
come
in
from
firehill
reddy
i
answered
you
could
have
said
it
over
the
wire
could
i
have
done
this
over
the
wire
he
said
giving
my
hand
a
shake
and
a
squeeze
you
know
i
couldn
t
and
that
s
what
i
wanted
to
a
grip
of
the
hand
that
helped
me
out
of
prison
i
said
some
fool
words
about
its
being
nothing
and
he
went
on
smiling
down
at
me
yet
with
something
grave
in
his
face
i
want
to
do
a
favor
of
you
i
hope
it
won
t
be
hard
to
grant
for
i
ve
set
my
heart
on
it
can
i
be
your
friend
oh
reddy
i
stammered
out
you
make
me
proud
and
suddenly
tears
came
into
my
eyes
i
don
t
know
why
unless
it
was
seeing
him
so
changed
and
hearing
him
speak
so
humble
to
a
common
guy
like
me
oh
come
now
he
said
don
t
do
anything
like
that
you
ll
make
me
think
you
don
t
like
the
idea
i
sniffed
wanting
to
kick
katie
reilly
who
was
gaping
round
in
her
chair
and
i
guess
getting
mad
that
way
dried
up
my
tears
it
s
your
friend
i
ll
be
till
the
end
of
my
life
reddy
i
answered
and
the
only
thing
i
m
sorry
for
is
that
i
didn
t
get
the
right
man
the
way
i
thought
i
d
done
never
mind
about
that
said
he
his
face
hardening
up
we
ll
get
him
yet
don
t
let
s
think
of
that
now
it
s
the
end
of
your
day
isn
t
it
if
you
re
going
home
will
you
let
me
take
you
there
in
my
car
there
was
a
time
when
if
i
d
thought
i
d
ever
ride
beside
jack
reddy
in
that
racer
i
d
have
had
chills
and
fever
for
a
week
in
advance
but
now
i
sat
calm
and
still
beside
him
as
he
rode
me
through
longwood
to
galway
s
door
as
we
swung
up
the
street
he
talked
very
kind
to
me
complimenting
me
something
awful
and
saying
that
if
he
ever
could
do
anything
for
me
to
let
him
know
and
he
d
do
it
if
it
was
within
the
power
of
man
you
see
miss
morganthau
he
said
as
we
drew
up
in
front
of
the
elite
a
man
in
my
position
feels
pretty
grateful
to
the
person
who
s
lifted
off
him
the
shadow
of
disgrace
and
death
up
in
my
room
i
sat
quiet
for
a
long
time
thinking
the
thing
that
phased
me
was
why
i
d
changed
so
come
round
to
feel
that
while
he
was
still
a
grand
strong
man
i
d
always
look
up
to
and
do
anything
for
i
d
quit
having
blind
staggers
and
heart
attacks
when
he
came
along
something
had
sidetracked
me
i
didn
t
know
what
all
i
did
know
was
that
two
months
ago
if
he
d
asked
me
to
be
his
friend
i
d
not
have
known
there
was
such
a
thing
as
food
in
the
world
and
that
evening
at
seven
being
too
lazy
to
go
to
the
gilt
edge
i
was
so
hungry
i
had
to
go
down
to
galway
and
beg
the
loan
of
three
uneedas
and
a
hard
boiled
egg
it
was
one
evening
not
long
after
that
anne
hennessey
came
in
to
see
me
babbitts
was
coming
that
night
and
galway
had
given
up
the
parlor
again
and
was
in
bed
with
a
novel
and
a
kerosene
lamp
anne
was
quite
excited
the
reason
being
that
fowler
had
given
her
a
present
she
took
it
careful
out
of
a
blue
velvet
case
and
held
it
up
in
the
glow
of
the
drop
light
it
was
a
diamond
cross
and
the
minute
i
set
eyes
on
it
i
knew
where
i
d
seen
it
before
sylvia
s
i
said
low
and
sort
of
awed
anne
nodded
yes
the
one
she
had
on
that
night
fowler
said
she
wanted
to
give
me
something
that
had
been
hers
i
wouldn
t
have
taken
anything
so
handsome
but
i
think
the
poor
lady
couldn
t
bear
the
sight
of
it
reminding
her
of
her
sorrow
as
it
did
she
moved
it
about
and
the
stones
sparkled
like
bits
of
fire
in
the
lamplight
i
stretched
out
my
hand
and
took
it
for
diamonds
tempt
me
like
meat
the
s
the
jew
in
me
i
suppose
you
won
t
call
the
king
your
cousin
when
you
wear
this
i
said
and
i
held
it
against
my
chest
looking
down
at
the
brightness
of
it
that
s
just
where
sylvia
had
it
on
said
anne
almost
in
a
whisper
where
the
front
of
her
dress
crossed
one
of
the
police
officers
told
me
my
mother
was
a
catholic
and
it
s
catholic
i
was
raised
for
though
my
father
was
a
jew
he
loved
my
mother
and
let
her
have
her
way
with
me
wouldn
t
you
think
i
said
that
when
the
murderer
saw
the
cross
on
her
it
would
have
stayed
his
hand
wouldn
t
you
said
anne
but
to
men
as
evil
as
that
the
cross
means
nothing
and
then
out
in
the
dark
that
way
he
probably
never
saw
it
babbitts
knock
sounding
i
handed
it
back
to
her
and
let
him
in
feeling
bashful
before
anne
who
didn
t
know
how
often
galway
was
retiring
at
she
left
soon
after
saying
fowler
liked
her
to
be
round
in
the
evening
which
was
news
to
me
as
she
d
told
me
that
the
fowlers
always
sat
in
the
together
the
doctor
reading
aloud
till
fowler
got
sleepy
after
she
d
gone
babbitts
and
i
drew
up
to
the
stove
cozy
and
cheerful
with
our
feet
on
the
edge
of
it
we
d
come
to
know
each
other
so
well
now
that
we
d
other
topics
beside
the
case
but
that
night
we
worked
around
to
it
me
picking
at
the
box
of
candy
babbitts
had
brought
and
rocking
lazily
as
contented
as
a
child
babbitts
was
still
keen
for
that
reward
he
said
to
me
you
had
your
fingers
on
it
once
and
it
s
my
wish
that
you
ll
get
your
whole
hand
on
it
next
time
what
a
noble
character
said
i
calculating
for
little
molly
to
get
it
all
where
do
come
in
oh
don
t
bother
about
me
says
he
you
ve
a
bad
habit
of
thinking
too
much
where
other
people
come
in
you
got
to
quit
isn
t
good
business
now
what
i
want
to
arrange
is
for
you
and
me
to
make
an
excursion
out
to
the
wayside
arbor
some
afternoon
the
wayside
ll
we
do
there
take
a
look
over
the
ground
you
see
with
the
process
of
elimination
that
s
been
going
on
things
have
narrowed
down
to
the
vicinity
of
the
crime
it
s
my
opinion
that
the
murder
was
not
only
committed
but
was
planned
round
there
the
police
are
losing
heart
and
not
doing
much
as
far
as
i
can
find
out
fowler
s
and
his
getting
their
pay
envelopes
regular
but
not
getting
anything
else
for
combine
our
two
giant
intellects
and
see
what
we
can
see
haven
t
they
gone
over
every
inch
of
it
they
a
comb
but
that
doesn
t
prevent
us
going
over
it
and
taking
our
combs
along
isn
t
hines
under
surveillance
good
lord
says
he
laughing
under
surveillance
there
s
not
one
of
the
suspects
but
knows
he
s
expected
to
stay
put
and
is
doing
it
but
who
s
getting
anywhere
there
s
no
reason
why
we
shouldn
t
go
out
that
way
call
on
cresset
and
take
a
look
in
at
the
wayside
arbor
ourselves
i
m
game
i
said
though
i
can
t
see
what
good
it
s
going
to
do
it
ll
give
us
a
together
said
he
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
about
it
but
that
looks
worth
while
to
me
we
made
a
date
for
the
following
monday
my
holiday
just
eight
weeks
from
the
murder
the
next
morning
i
had
a
kind
that
hasn
t
often
come
my
way
it
was
a
letter
directed
in
typewriting
with
a
of
paper
inside
it
inclosing
a
bill
on
the
paper
also
typed
was
written
for
miss
small
return
for
her
recent
good
work
in
the
hesketh
murder
case
that
was
name
no
date
no
handwriting
i
don
t
know
what
made
me
think
right
off
of
whitney
unless
it
was
because
there
was
no
one
else
who
knew
of
what
i
d
done
and
could
have
afforded
to
send
that
much
the
only
other
person
it
could
have
been
was
jack
reddy
and
somehow
or
other
after
he
d
asked
me
to
be
his
friend
i
felt
certain
he
wouldn
t
send
me
money
no
matter
what
i
d
done
for
him
friends
don
t
pay
each
other
i
guess
there
wasn
t
a
more
elated
person
in
longwood
that
morning
than
yours
truly
i
d
had
that
much
i
d
never
had
it
fall
out
of
the
sky
that
way
in
one
beautiful
crisp
new
bill
the
jew
and
the
irish
in
me
had
some
tussle
one
wanting
to
salt
it
down
in
the
bank
and
the
other
to
blow
it
in
but
that
time
the
irish
had
a
probably
because
i
was
limp
and
weary
with
all
the
excitement
of
the
last
two
months
and
felt
the
need
of
doing
something
foolish
to
tone
me
up
when
i
thought
of
the
clothes
i
could
buy
with
it
the
jew
just
lay
down
without
a
murmur
and
you
d
have
supposed
i
was
all
county
galway
if
you
d
seen
me
writing
a
list
of
things
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
if
it
ll
make
you
think
better
of
me
i
ll
confess
that
i
wanted
to
look
nice
on
that
trip
with
babbitts
the
first
real
jaunt
we
d
ever
taken
for
i
didn
t
count
those
times
in
new
york
when
we
were
sleuthing
after
cokesbury
just
once
in
my
life
i
was
going
to
have
a
real
blowout
and
i
wanted
the
chap
who
was
taking
me
to
feel
he
d
some
lady
with
him
with
three
of
us
in
the
office
i
fixed
things
so
i
got
saturday
afternoon
and
i
hiked
over
to
town
with
that
bill
burning
in
my
purse
like
a
live
coal
and
my
it
was
great
spending
it
i
was
cool
on
the
outside
looking
haughty
at
the
goods
and
casting
them
aside
contemptuous
on
chairs
but
inside
i
was
drunk
with
the
feeling
of
riches
i
bought
a
silk
dress
that
fitted
me
like
every
measure
was
mine
and
a
long
black
plush
coat
rich
fine
plush
like
satin
that
was
draped
something
elegant
and
fastened
in
front
with
a
novelty
ornament
for
a
hat
i
selected
a
small
dark
felt
nothing
flashy
no
trimming
just
a
rosette
at
one
side
and
with
the
last
three
dollars
a
purse
black
striped
silk
oval
shaped
with
a
ribbon
to
hang
it
to
your
wrist
it
was
six
when
i
got
home
carrying
the
boxes
but
the
coat
that
i
to
nearly
dead
with
the
weight
of
them
but
not
the
jew
nor
the
nickel
of
it
midday
monday
when
i
came
down
to
the
parlor
where
babbitts
was
waiting
he
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
like
the
indians
in
front
of
cigar
stores
and
pretended
to
stagger
illustration
came
down
to
the
parlor
where
babbitts
was
what
good
deed
have
i
ever
done
says
he
that
i
m
allowed
to
walk
the
world
with
such
a
queen
then
i
felt
certain
that
to
break
loose
now
and
again
is
a
healthy
change
xvi
it
was
a
long
ride
to
cresset
s
crossing
first
on
the
main
line
to
the
junction
and
then
just
time
to
make
a
close
connection
with
the
branch
line
to
the
crossing
it
was
three
when
we
reached
there
and
started
out
to
walk
to
cresset
s
farm
there
d
been
rain
the
day
before
and
the
road
was
muddy
with
water
standing
here
and
there
in
the
ruts
the
weather
was
still
overcast
the
sky
covered
with
clouds
heavy
and
leaden
colored
it
was
cold
a
raw
piercing
air
and
we
walked
fast
of
my
new
my
steps
on
the
edge
of
the
road
and
babbitts
tramping
along
in
the
mud
beside
me
i
d
never
been
up
there
at
that
season
and
i
thought
it
was
a
gloomy
lonesome
spot
the
land
rolled
away
with
fences
creeping
across
it
like
gray
snakes
here
and
there
were
clumps
of
woods
purplish
against
the
sky
and
between
them
the
brown
stretches
of
plowed
land
that
in
the
springtime
would
be
green
with
the
grain
now
under
those
dark
clouds
with
the
naked
trees
and
the
bare
empty
fields
it
looked
forlorn
and
dreary
it
was
as
still
as
a
picture
not
a
thing
moving
but
one
man
someways
off
walking
along
the
top
of
a
hill
you
could
see
him
like
a
silhouette
going
slow
with
a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
and
a
bit
of
red
round
his
neck
when
he
got
to
the
highest
point
he
stopped
and
looked
down
on
the
road
he
couldn
t
see
trees
he
seemed
as
babbitts
said
like
the
spirit
of
the
of
desolate
and
lonely
plodding
along
there
solitary
and
slow
between
the
earth
and
the
sky
then
presently
even
he
was
gone
disappearing
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
when
we
passed
the
riven
rock
road
and
i
could
see
the
firehill
one
making
a
curving
line
through
the
country
beyond
i
had
a
creepy
feeling
thinking
of
what
had
happened
there
eight
weeks
ago
where
s
the
place
i
said
almost
in
a
whisper
and
babbitts
pointed
ahead
with
his
cane
a
little
further
on
where
the
bushes
grow
thick
there
right
along
from
the
station
clumps
and
bunches
of
small
trees
had
edged
the
way
like
a
hedge
after
we
passed
the
riven
rock
road
they
grew
thicker
making
a
sort
of
shrubbery
higher
than
our
heads
i
remembered
that
just
before
the
murder
men
had
been
cutting
these
for
brushwood
and
even
now
we
passed
piles
of
branches
dry
and
dead
with
little
leaves
clinging
to
them
like
brown
rags
where
the
firehill
road
ran
into
the
turnpike
the
growth
was
tangled
and
close
almost
a
small
wood
it
wasn
t
far
beyond
that
babbitts
pointed
out
the
place
there
was
an
edge
of
shriveled
grass
and
on
this
she
had
been
found
with
the
branches
piled
over
her
he
drew
with
his
cane
where
she
had
lain
between
the
trees
and
the
road
you
can
see
just
how
the
murderer
worked
he
said
he
attacked
miss
hesketh
here
burst
out
of
the
darkness
on
her
and
killed
her
with
one
remember
there
was
no
sign
either
about
her
or
the
surroundings
of
a
almost
immediately
heard
the
doctor
s
auto
horn
we
can
place
that
by
the
scream
the
bohemian
woman
heard
do
you
think
he
was
there
when
the
doctor
passed
i
asked
of
course
he
was
he
hadn
t
had
time
to
arrange
the
body
that
was
done
after
the
doctor
had
gone
after
the
moon
came
out
reddy
said
it
was
as
bright
as
day
when
he
got
there
by
that
brightness
the
murderer
did
the
work
of
concealment
i
stepped
back
into
the
mud
and
looked
down
to
where
the
firehill
road
entered
the
turnpike
a
few
yards
farther
on
he
must
have
heard
reddy
s
horn
before
the
car
came
in
sight
by
that
time
he
had
probably
finished
and
stolen
away
i
don
t
think
so
said
babbitts
he
couldn
t
have
done
it
without
some
noise
and
reddy
who
was
listening
and
watching
for
sylvia
was
positive
there
wasn
t
a
sound
that
human
devil
was
back
among
the
bushes
when
reddy
s
car
came
round
the
turn
and
he
must
have
stayed
to
reddy
first
as
he
waited
then
as
he
slowly
ran
back
and
forth
god
what
a
man
looking
for
the
woman
he
loved
her
murderer
hidden
a
few
yards
from
him
and
between
them
both
her
dead
body
i
seemed
to
see
it
the
road
bathed
in
moonlight
the
murderer
huddled
down
in
the
black
shadow
and
reddy
in
the
car
looking
now
this
way
and
now
that
expecting
her
to
come
how
terribly
still
it
must
have
been
not
a
sound
except
the
rustling
of
the
withered
leaves
i
could
imagine
the
light
from
the
racer
s
lamps
shooting
out
in
two
long
yellow
rays
showing
every
rut
and
ridge
so
that
that
grim
watching
face
had
to
draw
down
lower
still
in
the
darkness
of
the
underbrush
did
he
know
who
reddy
was
waiting
for
what
did
he
feel
when
the
auto
moved
and
one
swerve
sideways
would
have
sent
those
yellow
rays
over
the
heap
of
branches
on
the
grass
as
babbitts
said
he
must
have
been
afraid
to
move
must
have
cowered
there
and
seen
the
racer
glide
away
and
then
come
back
and
still
bent
behind
the
network
of
twigs
have
watched
the
man
at
the
wheel
as
he
looked
up
and
down
the
road
waited
and
listened
every
now
and
then
sounding
the
horn
that
broke
into
the
silence
like
a
weird
hollow
cry
oh
come
on
i
said
suddenly
seizing
babbitts
arm
let
s
go
up
to
cresset
s
where
it
s
bright
and
cheerful
we
had
a
lovely
time
at
cresset
s
my
but
they
were
a
nice
family
farmer
cresset
a
big
kind
jolly
man
and
his
two
sons
splendid
chaps
and
his
little
daughter
as
fresh
as
a
peach
and
as
shy
as
a
kitten
i
loved
them
all
and
cresset
best
she
made
me
think
of
my
mother
not
that
she
looked
like
her
but
i
guess
because
she
had
something
about
her
that
s
about
all
women
who
ve
had
families
they
loved
they
gave
us
tea
and
cake
and
they
joked
babbitts
good
and
hard
about
coming
out
there
and
pretending
to
be
a
tourist
never
mind
son
farmer
cresset
said
you
got
it
out
of
the
old
woman
i
couldn
t
make
her
tell
seemed
like
she
thought
she
d
be
arrested
for
the
crime
if
she
up
and
confessed
about
that
feller
it
was
getting
on
for
evening
when
we
left
to
go
to
the
wayside
arbor
we
d
planned
to
have
our
supper
there
and
then
go
back
by
the
branch
line
catching
a
train
at
the
crossing
at
the
cressets
were
real
sorry
to
have
us
go
especially
there
it
ain
t
a
nice
place
said
cresset
as
she
kissed
me
but
we
re
hoping
to
see
it
cleared
out
soon
tom
s
stirring
heaven
and
earth
to
get
hines
license
revoked
i
guess
heaven
s
lending
a
hand
said
the
farmer
for
i
hear
hines
business
is
bad
since
the
fatality
we
ve
a
lot
of
foreign
labor
round
here
and
they
re
mighty
superstitious
and
are
giving
his
place
the
it
was
dark
when
we
saw
the
lights
of
the
wayside
arbor
shining
out
across
the
road
we
d
expected
a
moon
to
light
us
home
but
the
clouds
though
they
weren
t
as
thick
as
they
had
been
were
all
broken
up
into
little
bits
over
the
sky
like
heaven
was
paved
with
them
the
arbor
was
quiet
as
we
stepped
up
and
opened
the
bar
door
and
there
just
like
on
the
night
of
the
murder
was
hines
sitting
by
the
stove
reading
a
newspaper
he
jumped
up
quick
and
greeted
us
very
cordial
and
you
could
see
he
was
glad
to
get
a
customer
he
sure
was
a
tough
looking
specimen
with
a
gray
stubble
all
over
his
chin
and
a
dirty
sweater
hanging
open
over
a
dirtier
shirt
that
had
no
collar
and
was
fastened
with
a
fake
gold
button
that
left
a
black
mark
on
his
neck
if
i
thought
his
looks
were
bad
that
day
in
the
summer
i
thought
they
were
worse
now
for
he
seemed
more
down
and
dispirited
than
he
was
then
we
asked
him
if
we
could
have
supper
and
he
went
out
calling
to
hines
and
we
could
hear
someone
clattering
down
the
stairs
and
then
a
whispering
going
on
in
the
hall
when
he
came
back
he
said
they
d
get
us
a
cold
lunch
but
they
didn
t
keep
a
great
deal
on
hand
seeing
as
how
they
hadn
t
much
call
for
meals
at
that
season
you
could
see
that
was
true
i
never
was
in
such
a
miserable
hole
leaving
babbitts
talking
to
hines
in
the
bar
i
went
back
into
the
a
long
shabby
place
that
crossed
the
rear
of
the
house
it
was
as
dingy
as
the
rest
of
it
with
the
paper
all
smudged
and
peeling
off
the
walls
and
worn
bits
of
carpet
laid
over
the
board
floor
at
the
back
two
long
windows
looked
out
on
the
garden
glancing
through
these
i
could
see
the
arch
of
the
arbor
with
the
wet
shining
on
the
tables
and
a
few
withered
leaves
trembling
on
the
vines
when
i
turned
back
to
the
room
i
got
a
queer
kind
of
thing
i
would
have
laughed
at
anywhere
else
but
in
that
house
on
that
night
it
turned
me
creepy
there
was
a
long
mirror
on
the
opposite
wall
with
a
crack
going
straight
across
the
middle
of
it
as
i
caught
my
reflection
in
it
i
raised
my
head
wanting
to
get
the
effect
of
my
new
hat
and
it
brought
the
crack
exactly
across
my
neck
believe
me
i
jumped
and
then
stood
staring
for
it
looked
just
as
if
my
throat
was
cut
then
i
moved
away
from
it
pulling
up
my
collar
ashamed
of
myself
but
all
the
same
keeping
out
of
range
of
the
mirror
in
the
bar
i
could
hear
the
voices
of
babbitts
and
hines
hines
droning
on
like
a
person
who
s
complaining
from
behind
a
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
came
a
noise
of
crockery
and
pans
and
then
a
woman
s
voice
peevish
and
scolding
and
another
woman
s
answering
back
i
don
t
think
i
ever
was
in
a
place
that
got
on
my
nerves
so
and
what
with
the
cold
of
the
was
like
a
barn
with
no
steam
and
the
stove
not
sat
all
hunched
up
in
my
coat
thinking
of
sylvia
hesketh
coming
for
shelter
suddenly
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
room
opened
and
hines
came
in
she
was
the
match
of
it
all
with
her
red
nose
and
her
little
watery
eyes
and
her
shoes
dropping
off
at
every
step
so
you
could
hear
the
heels
rapping
on
the
boards
where
the
carpet
stopped
she
began
talking
in
a
whining
voice
and
as
she
set
the
table
told
me
how
the
business
had
gone
off
and
they
didn
t
know
what
they
were
going
to
do
her
hands
all
chapped
and
full
of
knots
like
twigs
smoothed
out
the
cloth
and
put
on
the
china
so
listless
it
made
you
tired
to
look
at
them
it
was
better
talking
to
her
than
sitting
dumb
with
no
company
but
dismal
thoughts
so
i
encouraged
her
and
between
her
trailings
into
the
kitchen
and
her
trailings
out
i
heard
all
about
their
affairs
for
a
while
after
the
murder
they
d
done
a
lot
of
made
me
sort
of
shrivel
up
to
see
she
didn
t
mind
that
anything
that
brought
trade
was
all
the
same
to
now
nothing
was
doing
only
a
few
automobiles
stopped
there
and
the
farmhands
had
dropped
off
so
their
custom
hardly
counted
and
tecla
rabine
the
bohemian
servant
who
was
a
girl
if
she
did
have
grouchy
spells
had
got
so
slack
she
d
have
to
be
fired
and
she
hines
didn
t
see
how
she
was
to
get
another
one
what
with
the
low
wages
and
the
lonesomeness
she
trailed
off
into
the
kitchen
again
and
i
could
hear
her
snapping
at
someone
and
that
other
woman
s
voice
growling
back
i
supposed
it
was
tecla
rabine
though
it
didn
t
sound
like
her
my
memory
of
her
at
the
inquest
being
of
a
fat
thing
that
wouldn
t
have
growled
at
anybody
and
then
the
door
was
opened
with
one
swift
kick
and
tecla
came
in
carrying
a
plate
of
bread
in
one
hand
and
a
platter
with
ham
on
it
in
the
other
she
didn
t
look
grouchy
at
all
but
gave
me
that
broad
silly
sort
of
smile
i
remembered
and
put
the
things
down
on
the
table
well
tecla
i
asked
for
something
to
say
how
are
getting
on
ach
she
answered
disgusted
and
pounded
over
the
creaky
floor
to
a
cupboard
out
of
which
she
took
some
dishes
me
i
get
out
what
for
do
i
stay
no
luck
here
no
money
who
everything
goes
on
the
blink
she
put
the
things
on
the
table
and
then
stood
looking
at
me
squinting
up
her
little
eyes
and
with
her
big
body
in
a
dirty
white
blouse
and
a
skirt
that
didn
t
meet
it
at
the
waist
slouched
up
against
the
table
i
heard
business
was
bad
i
said
and
thought
that
in
spite
of
her
being
such
a
coarse
fat
animal
she
was
rosy
and
healthy
looking
which
was
more
than
you
could
say
for
the
other
two
what
do
i
get
she
said
spreading
out
her
great
red
hands
not
a
thing
maybe
five
ten
cents
every
long
time
maybe
a
quarter
since
that
lady
gets
killed
all
goes
bad
the
dagoes
say
evil
they
walk
round
the
house
that
way
she
made
a
in
the
air
with
her
arm
looking
at
it
afraid
me
too
i
don
t
like
it
it
sure
is
awful
dismal
i
agreed
no
good
she
said
last
year
this
time
all
the
room
man
held
up
a
finger
in
the
one
only
man
and
he
have
lost
what
makes
us
to
laugh
when
i
see
him
i
say
tito
good
luck
now
you
come
make
the
bear
to
and
he
says
this
way
hunched
up
her
shoulders
and
pushed
out
her
hands
the
way
the
guineas
oh
gawda
there
is
no
more
bear
he
makes
dead
long
bear
i
said
and
then
i
remembered
you
mean
the
one
that
went
round
with
the
acrobats
it
s
dead
is
it
tecla
nodded
gone
dead
in
the
country
and
he
says
he
starve
now
with
no
bear
to
get
pennies
the
boss
says
we
all
starve
and
gave
him
a
drink
and
cheese
and
bread
ach
shook
her
head
as
if
the
loss
of
the
bear
was
the
last
i
no
can
stand
doing
no
money
no
more
quit
i
didn
t
blame
her
if
you
gave
me
two
hundred
a
month
i
wouldn
t
have
stayed
there
just
then
babbitts
came
in
and
we
began
our
supper
cold
ham
and
stale
bread
and
coffee
that
i
know
was
the
morning
s
heated
over
tecla
went
into
the
kitchen
and
i
said
to
him
low
and
guarded
what
s
hines
been
saying
to
you
he
answered
in
the
same
key
oh
putting
up
a
hard
luck
story
cresset
needn
t
bother
he
wants
to
pull
up
stakes
and
go
west
will
they
let
him
that
s
one
of
the
things
he
s
been
talking
about
he
says
if
he
makes
a
move
it
ll
look
suspicious
and
if
he
stays
he
ll
be
ruined
he
certainly
is
up
against
it
i
shot
a
glance
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bar
door
and
then
leaned
across
the
table
almost
whispering
i
don
t
see
that
our
investigations
have
got
us
anything
but
a
bad
supper
neither
do
i
he
whispered
back
the
place
looks
like
a
stage
setting
for
the
bandits
den
but
the
people
don
t
impress
me
that
way
at
all
the
kitchen
door
swung
back
and
hines
came
in
with
a
pumpkin
pie
that
tasted
like
it
was
baked
for
thanksgiving
she
hovered
round
fussing
about
us
and
joining
in
the
conversation
you
could
see
she
was
hungry
for
someone
to
talk
to
both
she
and
her
husband
impressed
me
that
way
as
if
they
were
most
crazy
with
the
dreariness
of
the
place
and
were
ready
to
fasten
on
anybody
who
d
speak
civil
to
them
and
listen
to
their
troubles
before
we
left
babbitts
went
into
the
bar
to
settle
up
and
i
remembering
tecla
s
complaints
called
her
in
from
the
kitchen
and
fished
a
quarter
out
of
my
new
purse
she
was
as
pleased
as
a
child
grinning
all
over
and
wanting
to
shake
hands
with
me
which
i
hated
but
couldn
t
avoid
when
we
were
once
more
in
the
road
i
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
i
felt
as
if
i
d
crept
out
from
under
a
shadow
that
was
gradually
sinking
into
me
down
to
the
marrow
of
my
bones
the
night
was
cold
but
a
different
kind
fresh
and
clear
the
smell
of
the
damp
fields
in
the
air
and
the
country
quiet
and
peaceful
we
had
a
good
two
miles
before
us
and
stepped
out
lively
it
was
dark
the
clouds
mottled
over
the
sky
and
in
one
place
where
the
moon
was
hidden
a
little
brightness
showing
through
the
cracks
babbitts
said
he
thought
they
d
break
and
that
we
d
have
the
moonlight
on
our
way
back
all
around
us
the
landscape
stretched
black
and
still
when
you
got
accustomed
to
it
you
could
see
the
outlines
of
the
hills
against
the
sky
one
darkness
set
against
another
and
the
line
of
the
road
showing
faint
between
the
edgings
of
bushes
we
couldn
t
hear
anything
but
our
own
footsteps
soft
and
padding
because
of
the
mud
and
off
and
on
the
rustling
of
the
twigs
as
i
brushed
against
them
i
don
t
remember
ever
being
out
on
a
quieter
night
and
there
was
something
lovely
and
soothing
about
it
after
that
horrible
house
we
hadn
t
gone
ten
minutes
i
should
i
suddenly
clasped
my
wrist
and
felt
that
my
purse
was
gone
i
had
taken
it
off
to
give
tecla
the
quarter
and
i
remember
i
d
laid
it
on
the
supper
table
when
she
made
me
shake
hands
oh
dear
i
said
stopping
short
what
shall
i
ve
left
my
purse
there
babbitts
stared
at
me
through
the
dark
at
hines
yes
on
the
supper
table
and
it
s
new
i
d
only
just
bought
it
oh
i
lose
it
you
needn
t
we
ve
time
but
you
ll
have
to
hit
up
the
pace
come
on
s
not
just
the
place
i
d
select
to
leave
a
purse
in
he
turned
to
go
but
i
stood
still
i
hated
going
back
there
and
it
was
lovely
walking
slowly
along
through
the
sharp
chill
air
and
the
peaceful
night
you
go
i
said
coaxing
i
ll
saunter
on
and
you
can
catch
me
up
don
t
you
mind
being
alone
aren
t
you
afraid
afraid
i
gave
a
laugh
i
m
much
more
afraid
in
that
queer
joint
besides
i
can
t
go
as
fast
as
you
can
and
whatever
happens
we
ve
got
to
catch
that
train
if
you
don
t
mind
that
s
the
best
plan
i
ll
run
both
ways
then
hustle
and
i
ll
walk
on
slowly
but
come
whether
you
find
the
purse
or
not
for
that
s
the
last
train
to
the
junction
and
we
mustn
t
lose
it
right
you
are
and
we
won
t
lose
anything
the
train
or
the
purse
i
ll
make
it
a
rush
order
go
slow
till
i
come
he
turned
and
went
off
at
a
run
and
i
walked
on
at
first
i
could
hear
the
thud
of
his
feet
quite
plainly
and
then
the
sound
was
suddenly
deadened
and
i
knew
he
was
on
the
moist
turf
by
the
roadside
the
silence
closed
down
around
me
like
a
black
curtain
that
seemed
to
be
shutting
me
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
i
walked
on
slowly
gathering
my
skirts
up
from
the
wet
and
the
twigs
as
noiseless
as
a
shadow
in
the
dark
of
the
trees
i
don
t
know
how
much
further
i
went
but
not
very
far
because
i
could
just
make
out
the
line
of
the
firehill
road
curving
down
between
the
fields
when
i
heard
behind
me
a
fitful
stealthy
rustling
in
the
bushes
xvii
in
beginning
this
chapter
which
is
going
to
end
my
story
of
the
hesketh
mystery
i
want
to
say
right
here
that
i
m
no
coward
the
reason
that
things
happened
as
they
did
was
that
i
was
worn
than
i
the
strain
and
excitement
of
the
last
two
months
also
i
do
think
that
most
any
girl
would
have
lost
her
nerve
if
she
d
been
up
against
what
i
was
the
gloom
of
that
dreadful
wayside
arbor
was
still
on
me
as
i
walked
along
with
babbitts
after
a
few
moments
i
thought
it
had
gone
off
and
when
i
told
him
i
wasn
t
afraid
i
said
what
seemed
to
me
the
truth
but
when
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
died
away
the
loneliness
crept
in
on
me
seemed
to
be
telling
me
something
that
i
didn
t
want
to
hear
down
deep
i
knew
what
it
was
and
that
every
step
was
taking
me
closer
to
what
i
was
afraid
place
where
sylvia
hesketh
had
been
murdered
it
was
when
i
was
peering
out
ahead
trying
to
locate
it
telling
myself
not
to
be
a
fool
and
gathering
up
my
courage
that
i
heard
that
faint
stealthy
rustling
behind
me
i
stopped
dead
listening
i
was
scared
but
not
clear
through
yet
for
i
knew
it
might
be
some
little
animal
a
rabbit
or
a
chipmunk
creeping
through
the
underbrush
i
stood
waiting
feeling
that
i
was
breathing
fast
and
as
still
as
one
of
the
telegraph
poles
along
the
road
the
trees
hid
me
completely
a
person
could
have
passed
close
by
and
not
seen
me
standing
there
in
my
black
cloak
against
the
black
background
then
i
heard
it
again
very
soft
and
cautious
a
crackle
of
branches
and
then
a
wait
and
seemed
crackle
of
branches
again
i
moved
forward
stepping
on
tiptoe
stifling
my
breath
my
head
turned
sideways
listening
listening
with
every
nerve
even
then
i
wasn
t
so
terribly
frightened
but
i
was
shivery
shivery
down
to
my
heart
for
i
could
hear
that
whether
it
was
beast
or
human
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
trees
just
a
little
way
back
going
the
way
i
was
it
only
took
a
few
stealing
forward
and
it
coming
on
now
soft
as
it
stepped
on
the
earth
now
with
a
twig
snapping
tell
me
i
was
being
followed
when
i
got
that
clear
the
last
of
my
courage
melted
away
if
it
had
been
anywhere
else
if
it
hadn
t
been
so
dark
if
there
d
been
a
house
or
a
person
within
call
but
oh
lord
in
that
lonesomeness
far
off
from
was
awful
and
the
awfullest
part
was
that
right
there
in
front
of
me
getting
nearer
every
minute
was
the
place
where
another
girl
had
been
murdered
on
a
night
like
this
i
tried
to
pull
myself
together
to
remember
that
babbitts
would
be
back
soon
but
i
couldn
t
stop
my
heart
from
beating
like
a
hammer
terrible
thuds
up
in
my
throat
way
off
through
the
trees
i
could
see
the
twinkle
of
cresset
s
lights
and
i
thought
of
them
there
but
it
was
as
if
they
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
too
far
for
me
to
reach
them
or
for
them
to
hear
my
call
i
don
t
know
why
i
walked
on
but
i
think
it
was
pure
fear
i
was
afraid
if
i
stopped
that
dreadful
following
thing
would
overtake
me
once
i
tried
to
look
back
but
i
couldn
t
i
thought
i
might
see
it
and
i
stole
forward
now
and
then
stopping
and
listening
and
every
time
hearing
the
crackle
and
snap
of
the
twigs
as
it
crept
after
me
i
could
see
now
the
place
where
sylvia
was
found
the
shrubs
curving
back
from
the
road
as
if
to
leave
a
space
wide
enough
for
her
body
the
sight
made
me
stop
and
as
i
stood
there
still
as
a
statue
i
heard
the
sounds
behind
me
get
louder
as
if
a
big
body
was
feeling
and
pushing
its
way
between
the
trees
not
so
careful
now
but
trampling
and
crushing
through
the
interlaced
boughs
then
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
knew
what
it
means
when
they
say
your
hair
stands
on
end
down
at
the
roots
of
mine
there
was
a
stirring
all
over
my
head
and
my
heart
it
was
banging
against
my
chest
blow
after
blow
as
if
it
was
trying
to
break
a
hole
the
sky
began
to
brighten
i
got
a
sort
of
impression
of
those
cracks
in
the
clouds
parting
and
the
moonlight
leaking
through
but
i
didn
t
seem
to
see
it
plain
everything
in
me
was
turned
to
terror
the
noise
behind
me
was
closer
and
louder
and
through
it
i
heard
a
breathing
deep
panting
breaths
drawn
hard
then
i
knew
if
i
turned
i
could
have
seen
what
was
following
me
seen
its
awful
face
glaring
between
the
branches
and
its
bent
body
crouched
ready
to
spring
it
s
hard
for
me
to
tell
what
came
together
and
i
couldn
t
see
or
think
i
remember
trying
to
scream
to
give
one
shriek
for
babbitts
and
no
sound
coming
and
that
the
thing
as
if
it
knew
what
i
was
doing
made
a
sudden
crashing
close
at
my
back
the
brightness
of
the
sky
flashed
in
my
eyes
i
saw
the
clouds
broken
open
and
the
moon
big
and
white
whirling
round
like
a
silver
plate
i
tried
to
run
but
the
earth
rose
up
in
waves
and
i
staggered
forward
over
them
wave
after
wave
with
the
moon
spinning
close
to
my
eyes
and
then
blackness
shutting
down
like
the
lid
of
a
box
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
the
sky
with
clouds
all
over
it
and
in
one
place
an
opening
with
a
little
star
as
big
as
a
pinhead
set
in
the
middle
i
looked
at
that
star
for
a
long
time
having
a
queer
feeling
that
i
was
holding
on
to
it
and
it
was
pulling
me
up
then
i
felt
as
if
something
was
helping
the
star
a
strong
support
under
my
shoulders
that
raised
me
still
further
and
while
i
seemed
to
be
struggling
out
of
a
darkness
like
water
i
heard
babbitts
voice
close
to
my
ear
thank
god
she
s
coming
out
of
it
i
turned
my
head
and
there
was
his
face
close
to
mine
a
strong
yellow
light
shone
on
i
saw
it
came
from
a
lantern
on
the
without
speaking
i
looked
into
his
eyes
and
had
a
lovely
feeling
of
rest
as
if
i
d
found
something
i
was
looking
for
you
re
all
right
he
said
you
re
not
hurt
i
m
very
well
thank
you
i
said
back
and
my
voice
was
like
a
whisper
the
support
under
my
shoulders
tightened
drew
me
up
against
him
and
he
bent
down
and
kissed
me
we
said
no
more
but
stayed
that
way
looking
at
each
other
i
didn
t
want
to
move
or
speak
i
didn
t
feel
anything
or
care
about
anything
it
seemed
like
babbitts
and
i
were
the
only
two
people
in
the
whole
world
as
if
there
no
world
just
us
and
all
the
rest
nothing
after
s
often
told
me
it
was
only
a
minute
or
two
though
if
you
d
asked
me
i
d
have
said
it
was
began
to
look
round
and
take
notice
i
heard
queer
sounds
as
if
someone
was
groaning
in
pain
and
saw
the
shrubs
and
grass
plain
by
the
light
of
two
lanterns
standing
on
the
ground
near
these
was
a
man
lit
up
as
far
as
his
knees
and
close
by
him
all
crumpled
on
the
earth
another
person
the
lanterns
threw
a
bright
glow
over
the
upper
part
of
that
figure
and
i
saw
the
head
and
shoulders
the
hair
with
leaves
and
twigs
in
it
and
round
the
neck
a
red
bandanna
then
i
made
out
it
was
a
man
and
that
it
was
from
him
the
sounds
were
and
groans
and
words
in
a
strange
language
what
is
it
i
whispered
to
babbitts
what
s
happened
and
he
whispered
back
i
ll
tell
you
later
you
re
all
s
all
that
matters
now
it
was
like
a
dream
and
i
can
only
tell
it
that
noticing
things
in
little
broken
bits
as
if
i
was
at
the
movies
and
kept
falling
to
sleep
and
then
woke
up
and
saw
a
new
picture
the
man
who
was
standing
turned
round
and
it
was
hines
he
looked
across
the
road
and
gave
a
shout
and
others
answered
it
and
lights
danced
up
and
down
coming
closer
through
the
dark
then
men
came
cresset
and
his
behind
them
hines
with
her
clothes
held
up
high
and
her
thin
legs
like
a
stork
s
i
could
hear
them
breathing
as
they
raced
up
and
one
man
s
voice
crying
it
s
all
right
is
it
there
ain
t
been
no
harm
done
after
that
the
men
were
in
a
group
talking
low
the
lanterns
in
their
hands
sending
circles
and
squares
of
light
over
the
bushes
and
the
grass
presently
farmer
cresset
broke
away
and
went
to
the
figure
on
the
ground
he
tried
to
pull
him
up
but
the
man
squirmed
out
of
his
hand
and
fell
back
like
a
meal
sack
his
face
to
the
earth
the
moans
coming
from
him
loud
and
awful
after
a
while
they
put
me
on
something
long
and
hard
with
a
bundle
under
my
head
and
took
me
away
up
the
road
and
through
the
woods
it
was
dark
and
no
one
said
anything
the
cresset
boys
carrying
what
i
was
on
and
babbitts
walking
alongside
as
we
started
i
heard
someone
say
the
farmer
would
stay
with
hines
and
communicate
with
the
authorities
and
then
we
went
swinging
off
under
the
trees
the
footsteps
of
the
men
squashing
in
the
mud
soon
there
were
lights
twinkling
through
the
branches
and
just
as
i
saw
them
and
heard
a
dog
bark
and
a
woman
call
out
my
heart
faded
away
again
and
that
blackness
swept
over
me
i
didn
t
know
till
afterwards
how
long
i
was
it
in
cresset
s
spare
room
with
that
blessed
woman
caring
for
me
like
her
own
daughter
no
people
in
this
world
were
ever
better
to
another
than
that
family
was
to
me
and
others
were
takes
sickness
and
trouble
to
make
you
value
human
when
i
got
desperate
bad
fowler
came
over
and
took
a
hand
cresset
herself
told
me
that
respecting
graham
as
she
did
she
thought
i
d
never
have
come
through
if
fowler
hadn
t
given
himself
right
up
to
it
staying
in
the
house
for
two
days
the
time
i
was
worst
and
not
a
cent
would
he
ever
take
for
it
only
a
pair
of
bed
slippers
i
knitted
for
him
while
i
was
getting
better
it
was
not
till
i
was
well
along
on
the
upgrade
that
i
heard
what
happened
on
that
gruesome
night
i
was
still
in
bed
sitting
up
in
a
pink
flannel
jacket
that
anne
hennessey
gave
me
with
the
sunlight
streaming
in
through
the
windows
and
a
bunch
of
violets
scenting
up
the
room
babbitts
had
brought
them
and
it
was
he
that
told
me
sitting
in
a
rocker
by
the
bedside
and
speaking
very
quiet
and
gentle
so
as
not
to
give
me
any
shock
for
without
my
knowledge
just
like
an
instrument
of
fate
it
was
i
that
had
solved
the
hesketh
mystery
neither
man
nor
woman
had
killed
sylvia
hesketh
the
murderer
was
the
dancing
bear
the
man
they
found
on
the
ground
beside
me
that
night
was
its
owner
tito
malti
the
dago
i
had
seen
nearly
three
months
before
making
the
bear
dance
at
longwood
and
the
man
babbitts
and
i
had
seen
that
afternoon
on
the
hill
hines
and
farmer
cresset
carried
was
unable
to
walk
at
the
wayside
arbor
and
in
the
bar
there
he
told
them
his
story
he
had
been
associated
with
the
acrobats
for
several
years
working
over
the
country
with
them
during
the
summer
and
lying
up
in
small
towns
for
the
winter
that
spring
when
the
company
went
out
on
their
tour
he
had
noticed
that
his
bear
he
called
it
bruno
and
spoke
of
it
like
a
human
showed
signs
of
bad
temper
it
was
a
big
strong
beast
but
was
getting
old
and
a
viciousness
that
it
had
always
had
was
growing
on
it
he
kept
quiet
about
it
as
he
hoped
to
get
through
the
season
without
trouble
and
knew
if
the
company
thought
it
was
dangerous
they
wouldn
t
stand
for
having
it
around
all
the
summer
he
wandered
with
them
guarding
the
bear
carefully
never
leaving
it
unmuzzled
and
sleeping
beside
it
at
night
toward
the
end
of
the
season
it
began
to
grow
worse
it
had
tried
to
attack
one
of
the
acrobats
and
there
had
been
a
quarrel
he
saw
he
d
have
to
part
from
them
but
they
patched
up
the
fight
and
he
stayed
on
for
their
last
performance
at
longwood
where
the
business
was
always
good
after
that
they
separated
the
company
going
into
winter
quarters
at
bloomington
and
malti
telling
them
he
would
take
bruno
across
country
and
make
a
little
extra
money
at
the
farms
and
villages
he
did
intend
to
do
this
but
he
really
wanted
to
get
off
by
himself
watch
the
animal
and
try
and
gain
his
old
control
over
it
he
started
working
round
by
the
turnpike
letting
bruno
perform
when
he
seemed
good
tempered
but
a
good
part
of
the
time
being
afraid
to
in
this
way
he
made
enough
money
to
keep
himself
sleeping
when
the
nights
were
bad
in
barns
and
on
the
lee
side
of
hayricks
the
bear
chained
to
him
on
the
night
of
the
murder
he
had
got
round
as
far
as
the
wayside
arbor
his
intention
had
been
to
take
his
supper
knew
the
place
have
the
bear
dance
for
the
italian
customers
but
by
the
time
he
reached
the
arbor
he
didn
t
dare
for
some
days
bruno
had
been
sullen
and
afternoon
malti
had
had
to
beat
him
with
the
staff
he
always
carried
the
poor
man
said
he
was
half
crazy
with
fright
and
misery
he
told
hines
and
cresset
who
said
he
was
as
simple
as
a
young
child
that
what
between
his
fear
of
getting
into
trouble
with
the
authorities
and
his
fear
of
losing
the
bear
which
was
all
he
had
in
the
world
he
was
distracted
in
the
afternoon
he
had
begged
some
food
at
a
farm
and
with
this
in
his
pocket
he
tracked
across
the
fields
and
woods
to
the
turnpike
near
the
firehill
road
being
a
lonely
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
that
hid
him
from
the
highway
and
ate
his
supper
as
he
had
been
on
the
tramp
for
days
he
was
dropping
with
fatigue
and
seeing
the
bear
seemed
quiet
he
stretched
out
and
with
the
chain
in
his
hand
had
fallen
asleep
he
was
wakened
by
a
most
awful
he
had
ever
heard
half
asleep
as
he
was
he
leaped
to
his
feet
feeling
in
the
dark
for
the
chain
it
was
gone
and
the
bear
with
it
the
scream
had
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
trees
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
he
burst
through
them
and
in
the
darkness
saw
dimly
the
shape
of
that
fearful
great
beast
reared
upon
its
hind
legs
with
a
black
thing
lying
at
its
feet
he
yelled
and
struck
it
in
the
face
with
the
staff
and
it
dropped
down
to
all
fours
growling
and
terrible
but
as
if
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
blows
had
cowed
it
then
he
grabbed
for
the
chain
moving
along
the
ground
like
a
snake
and
holding
it
knelt
and
looked
at
the
black
thing
the
scream
had
come
from
he
raised
it
and
saw
the
faint
white
of
the
face
and
hands
and
felt
by
the
clothes
it
was
a
woman
he
knew
the
way
an
enraged
bear
up
to
its
hind
legs
and
giving
a
blow
with
its
paw
a
blow
that
if
the
body
it
strikes
is
unprotected
can
break
bones
and
tear
muscles
out
of
their
place
in
the
dark
he
felt
the
woman
till
his
hand
came
on
the
trickle
of
blood
on
her
face
that
told
him
the
brute
had
struck
at
her
head
and
sick
and
trembling
he
lit
a
match
and
held
it
low
over
her
the
hat
had
protected
her
from
the
claws
without
it
they
would
have
torn
through
the
scalp
like
the
teeth
of
a
rake
but
when
he
saw
her
face
and
felt
of
her
pulse
he
knew
that
that
savage
blow
had
broken
her
skull
and
she
was
dead
at
first
he
was
too
paralyzed
to
think
kneeling
there
beside
her
with
the
bear
crouched
at
the
end
of
his
chain
not
stirring
as
if
it
was
scared
at
what
it
had
done
then
the
horn
of
the
doctor
s
auto
woke
him
and
clutching
the
body
he
drew
back
into
the
shadow
the
car
passed
at
furious
speed
its
noise
drowning
any
sound
that
that
strange
and
awful
group
might
have
made
shaking
in
every
limb
he
laid
his
burden
on
the
grass
and
tried
to
compose
it
putting
back
the
hat
which
was
torn
off
but
was
caught
to
the
hair
by
its
long
pin
while
he
was
doing
this
the
clouds
broke
and
he
was
drawing
the
coat
about
her
when
the
moon
came
out
bright
as
day
by
its
light
he
saw
the
pearl
necklace
and
in
his
own
words
all
the
badness
in
his
heart
came
up
into
his
head
when
he
told
that
part
of
his
story
he
wrung
his
hands
and
sobbed
declaring
over
and
over
that
he
was
an
honest
man
and
a
good
catholic
never
before
had
he
stolen
though
often
he
had
gone
cold
and
hungry
but
he
knew
now
that
he
must
kill
the
bear
and
then
he
would
be
left
an
old
man
without
a
penny
or
any
way
to
earn
one
and
the
pearls
he
moaned
out
what
are
they
to
the
dead
and
to
me
who
must
live
they
mean
riches
forever
he
said
his
hands
shook
so
he
couldn
t
find
the
clasp
and
to
get
at
it
he
pulled
open
the
coat
and
then
he
gave
a
cry
and
drew
back
like
he
was
burnt
for
there
on
the
breast
of
the
dead
woman
sparkling
like
a
thing
of
fire
was
the
cross
babbitts
said
the
two
men
were
greatly
impressed
by
the
way
he
acted
when
he
told
this
the
perspiration
broke
out
on
his
face
and
he
crossed
himself
bowing
his
head
and
shuddering
it
was
god
s
voice
he
whispered
it
said
stop
tito
hold
your
hand
no
man
can
rob
the
so
he
closed
the
coat
folded
the
arms
across
the
chest
and
covered
all
with
branches
he
found
in
a
pile
near
by
as
he
moved
about
the
bear
watched
him
not
stirring
as
if
it
knew
it
was
guilty
and
was
waiting
to
see
what
he
would
do
to
it
when
the
work
was
finished
the
two
of
them
stole
away
as
noiseless
as
shadows
his
head
was
clear
enough
to
think
of
the
footprints
and
he
kept
on
the
grass
till
he
was
near
the
firehill
road
he
was
approaching
this
when
he
heard
reddy
s
horn
and
with
the
bear
following
he
slipped
through
a
break
in
the
trees
into
the
open
space
beyond
here
huddled
into
the
blackness
under
the
boughs
he
saw
the
car
swing
past
it
went
a
little
way
down
the
road
and
then
stopped
and
stood
for
what
seemed
to
him
a
long
time
every
now
and
then
the
horn
sounding
when
it
finally
started
again
he
moved
on
the
bear
padding
silently
beside
him
he
said
the
car
came
back
soon
and
passed
and
repassed
him
a
number
of
times
each
time
he
was
ready
for
it
the
noise
and
the
lamps
warning
him
of
its
approach
crowded
up
against
the
bear
he
watched
it
through
the
branches
all
the
road
bright
in
front
of
it
where
the
lamps
threw
their
two
long
shoots
of
light
when
they
asked
him
if
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
the
bear
making
some
sound
he
shook
his
head
and
said
just
like
a
child
bruno
is
wise
like
a
man
when
i
look
him
in
the
eye
i
see
he
knows
he
is
a
murderer
and
must
die
and
it
makes
him
very
quiet
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
bruno
as
he
told
the
men
about
it
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
for
he
said
the
bear
was
like
his
brother
when
reddy
had
gone
he
made
off
bruno
walking
at
the
end
of
the
chain
behind
him
both
keeping
to
the
grass
edges
of
the
fields
all
night
they
walked
those
strange
they
must
have
looked
slipping
across
the
moonlit
spaces
two
black
shadows
moving
over
the
lonesomeness
not
a
sound
from
either
of
them
one
leading
the
other
to
his
execution
at
dawn
they
entered
the
woods
there
when
the
light
was
clear
enough
to
see
that
poor
scared
dago
killed
the
bear
with
the
knife
he
had
carried
all
summer
the
rest
of
the
day
he
spent
scooping
a
grave
for
him
when
he
told
how
he
dragged
the
great
body
into
the
hole
and
covered
it
with
earth
he
put
his
hands
over
his
face
rocking
back
and
forth
and
crying
like
a
baby
after
that
he
went
to
bloomington
and
joined
the
acrobats
telling
them
the
bear
had
died
they
thought
no
more
about
it
and
welcomed
him
back
sharing
their
quarters
with
him
and
promising
him
a
place
with
them
in
the
summer
but
his
knowledge
of
the
crime
haunted
him
like
all
those
dagoes
he
was
superstitious
and
full
of
queer
notions
babbitts
said
he
was
as
ignorant
as
the
animal
he
was
so
fond
of
seeming
to
think
as
they
couldn
t
hang
the
bear
they
might
hang
him
in
its
place
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
priest
and
confess
but
when
he
heard
people
talking
of
the
murder
he
was
afraid
after
a
while
he
couldn
t
eat
or
sleep
and
the
torment
of
his
terror
and
remorse
was
like
to
drive
him
crazy
finally
he
couldn
t
stand
it
any
more
and
got
the
idea
that
if
he
could
go
back
to
the
place
and
offer
up
prayers
there
he
might
get
some
relief
he
told
the
acrobats
he
was
going
to
hunt
for
work
on
a
farm
left
bloomington
and
once
again
walked
across
the
country
it
was
night
when
he
reached
the
region
he
was
bound
for
and
feeling
too
weak
and
sick
to
go
straight
to
the
spot
he
went
to
the
wayside
arbor
to
beg
for
food
which
would
give
him
strength
to
bear
the
task
he
had
set
himself
they
gave
him
what
he
asked
for
and
he
took
it
to
his
old
nook
under
the
trees
and
there
in
the
cold
and
dark
ate
ravenously
then
just
as
on
that
other
night
he
lay
down
and
the
sleep
that
had
left
him
for
so
long
came
back
to
him
he
never
heard
us
pass
but
i
guess
without
his
knowing
it
we
wakened
him
for
he
said
he
was
sitting
up
rubbing
his
eyes
when
he
heard
babbitts
footsteps
as
he
ran
back
to
the
inn
he
listened
and
making
sure
no
one
else
was
on
the
road
got
up
and
began
to
steal
cautiously
forward
he
felt
sure
that
god
would
hear
his
prayers
after
he
had
walked
so
far
and
his
misery
had
been
so
great
i
guess
the
poor
thing
was
about
all
in
and
was
as
scared
when
he
came
near
the
place
as
i
was
of
course
he
had
no
idea
i
was
in
front
of
him
and
wasn
t
following
me
as
i
thought
with
the
trees
between
both
of
us
were
making
for
the
same
spot
the
only
difference
being
that
while
i
heard
him
he
never
heard
me
what
he
saw
when
he
broke
through
the
hedge
would
have
terrified
anyone
let
alone
a
man
in
the
state
he
was
for
there
just
as
he
had
last
seen
her
lay
a
woman
in
a
black
coat
with
the
moonlight
shining
on
her
dead
white
ghost
waiting
to
accuse
him
they
say
the
shriek
he
gave
was
the
most
awful
that
man
ever
heard
babbitts
who
was
on
his
way
back
said
it
sounded
like
it
came
from
a
lost
soul
in
hell
he
tried
to
yell
back
but
couldn
t
and
ran
like
a
madman
and
when
he
got
there
saw
me
lying
as
if
i
was
dead
in
the
moonlight
and
a
wild
screaming
figure
crouched
on
the
ground
beside
me
the
two
hines
heard
it
hines
picked
up
a
lantern
and
ran
with
hines
at
his
heels
when
he
came
up
he
found
babbitts
kneeling
over
me
half
crazy
thinking
i
was
murdered
too
they
felt
my
pulse
and
found
it
was
going
and
sent
hines
on
the
run
to
cresset
s
she
lit
out
calling
and
crying
as
she
flew
through
the
woods
and
met
the
cresset
crowd
hiking
along
with
their
lanterns
having
heard
her
and
not
knowing
had
happened
s
the
end
of
my
story
oh
i
forgot
the
got
it
i
oughtn
t
to
have
for
i
didn
t
do
anything
but
fall
in
a
faint
which
was
the
easiest
thing
i
could
do
but
fowler
and
the
doctor
wouldn
t
have
it
any
other
way
so
i
gave
in
not
that

didn
t
want
to
believe
me

weak

thousand
dollars
