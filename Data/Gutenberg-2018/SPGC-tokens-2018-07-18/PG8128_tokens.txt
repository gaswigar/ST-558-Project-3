in
ghostly
japan
fragment
and
it
was
at
the
hour
of
sunset
that
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
was
in
that
place
no
sign
of
life
neither
token
of
water
nor
trace
of
plant
nor
shadow
of
flying
bird
nothing
but
desolation
rising
to
desolation
and
the
summit
was
lost
in
heaven
then
the
bodhisattva
said
to
his
young
companion
what
you
have
asked
to
see
will
be
shown
to
you
but
the
place
of
the
vision
is
far
and
the
way
is
rude
follow
after
me
and
do
not
fear
strength
will
be
given
you
twilight
gloomed
about
them
as
they
climbed
there
was
no
beaten
path
nor
any
mark
of
former
human
visitation
and
the
way
was
over
an
endless
heaping
of
tumbled
fragments
that
rolled
or
turned
beneath
the
foot
sometimes
a
mass
dislodged
would
clatter
down
with
hollow
echoings
sometimes
the
substance
trodden
would
burst
like
an
empty
shell
pointed
and
thrilled
and
the
darkness
deepened
do
not
fear
my
son
said
the
bodhisattva
guiding
danger
there
is
none
though
the
way
be
grim
under
the
stars
they
climbed
fast
fast
mounting
by
help
of
power
superhuman
high
zones
of
mist
they
passed
and
they
saw
below
them
ever
widening
as
they
climbed
a
soundless
flood
of
cloud
like
the
tide
of
a
milky
sea
hour
after
hour
they
climbed
and
forms
invisible
yielded
to
their
tread
with
dull
soft
crashings
and
faint
cold
fires
lighted
and
died
at
every
breaking
and
once
the
laid
hand
on
a
something
smooth
that
was
not
stone
and
lifted
it
and
dimly
saw
the
cheekless
gibe
of
death
linger
not
thus
my
son
urged
the
voice
of
the
teacher
the
summit
that
we
must
gain
is
very
far
away
on
through
the
dark
they
climbed
and
felt
continually
beneath
them
the
soft
strange
breakings
and
saw
the
icy
fires
worm
and
die
till
the
rim
of
the
night
turned
grey
and
the
stars
began
to
fail
and
the
east
began
to
bloom
yet
still
they
climbed
fast
fast
mounting
by
help
of
power
superhuman
about
them
now
was
frigidness
of
death
and
silence
tremendous
gold
flame
kindled
in
the
east
then
first
to
the
pilgrim
gaze
the
steeps
revealed
their
nakedness
and
a
trembling
seized
him
and
a
ghastly
fear
for
there
was
not
any
ground
neither
beneath
him
nor
about
him
nor
above
him
but
a
heaping
only
monstrous
and
measureless
of
skulls
and
fragments
of
skulls
and
dust
of
bone
with
a
shimmer
of
shed
teeth
strown
through
the
drift
of
it
like
the
shimmer
of
scrags
of
shell
in
the
wrack
of
a
tide
do
not
fear
my
son
cried
the
voice
of
the
bodhisattva
only
the
strong
of
heart
can
win
to
the
place
of
the
vision
behind
them
the
world
had
vanished
nothing
remained
but
the
clouds
beneath
and
the
sky
above
and
the
heaping
of
skulls
between
out
of
sight
then
the
sun
climbed
with
the
climbers
and
there
was
no
warmth
in
the
light
of
him
but
coldness
sharp
as
a
sword
and
the
horror
of
stupendous
height
and
the
nightmare
of
stupendous
depth
and
the
terror
of
silence
ever
grew
and
grew
and
weighed
upon
the
pilgrim
and
held
his
feet
so
that
suddenly
all
power
departed
from
him
and
he
moaned
like
a
sleeper
in
dreams
hasten
hasten
my
son
cried
the
bodhisattva
the
day
is
brief
and
the
summit
is
very
far
away
but
the
pilgrim
shrieked
i
fear
i
fear
unspeakably
and
the
power
has
departed
from
me
the
power
will
return
my
son
made
answer
the
bodhisattva
look
now
below
you
and
above
you
and
about
you
and
tell
me
what
you
see
i
can
not
cried
the
pilgrim
trembling
and
clinging
i
dare
not
look
beneath
before
me
and
about
me
there
is
nothing
but
skulls
of
men
and
yet
my
son
said
the
bodhisattva
laughing
softly
and
yet
you
do
not
know
of
what
this
mountain
is
made
the
other
shuddering
repeated
i
fear
unutterably
i
fear
there
is
nothing
but
skulls
of
men
a
mountain
of
skulls
it
is
responded
the
bodhisattva
but
know
my
son
that
all
of
them
are
your
own
each
has
at
some
time
been
the
nest
of
your
dreams
and
delusions
and
desires
not
even
one
of
them
is
the
skull
of
any
other
being
all
all
without
exception
have
been
yours
in
the
billions
of
your
former
lives
furisode
recently
while
passing
through
a
little
street
tenanted
chiefly
by
dealers
in
old
wares
i
noticed
a
furisode
or
robe
of
the
rich
purple
tint
called
murasaki
hanging
before
one
of
the
shops
it
was
a
robe
such
as
might
have
been
worn
by
a
lady
of
rank
in
the
time
of
the
tokugawa
i
stopped
to
look
at
the
five
crests
upon
it
and
in
the
same
moment
there
came
to
my
recollection
this
legend
of
a
similar
robe
said
to
have
once
caused
the
destruction
of
yedo
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
the
daughter
of
a
rich
merchant
of
the
city
of
the
shoguns
while
attending
some
festival
perceived
in
the
crowd
a
young
samurai
of
remarkable
beauty
and
immediately
fell
in
love
with
him
unhappily
for
her
he
disappeared
in
the
press
before
she
could
learn
through
her
attendants
who
he
was
or
whence
he
had
come
but
his
image
remained
vivid
in
her
memory
even
to
the
least
detail
of
his
costume
the
holiday
attire
then
worn
by
samurai
youths
was
scarcely
less
brilliant
than
that
of
young
girls
and
the
upper
dress
of
this
handsome
stranger
had
seemed
wonderfully
beautiful
to
the
enamoured
maiden
she
fancied
that
by
wearing
a
robe
of
like
quality
and
color
bearing
the
same
crest
she
might
be
able
to
attract
his
notice
on
some
future
occasion
accordingly
she
had
such
a
robe
made
with
very
long
sleeves
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
period
and
she
prized
it
greatly
she
wore
it
whenever
she
went
out
and
when
at
home
she
would
suspend
it
in
her
room
and
try
to
imagine
the
form
of
her
unknown
beloved
within
it
sometimes
she
would
pass
hours
before
it
dreaming
and
weeping
by
turns
and
she
would
pray
to
the
gods
and
the
buddhas
that
she
might
win
the
young
affection
often
repeating
the
invocation
of
the
nichiren
sect
namu
myo
ho
rengé
kyo
but
she
never
saw
the
youth
again
and
she
pined
with
longing
for
him
and
sickened
and
died
and
was
buried
after
her
burial
the
robe
that
she
had
so
much
prized
was
given
to
the
buddhist
temple
of
which
her
family
were
parishioners
it
is
an
old
custom
to
thus
dispose
of
the
garments
of
the
dead
the
priest
was
able
to
sell
the
robe
at
a
good
price
for
it
was
a
costly
silk
and
bore
no
trace
of
the
tears
that
had
fallen
upon
it
it
was
bought
by
a
girl
of
about
the
same
age
as
the
dead
lady
she
wore
it
only
one
day
then
she
fell
sick
and
began
to
act
strangely
crying
out
that
she
was
haunted
by
the
vision
of
a
beautiful
young
man
and
that
for
love
of
him
she
was
going
to
die
and
within
a
little
while
she
died
and
the
sleeved
robe
was
a
second
time
presented
to
the
temple
again
the
priest
sold
it
and
again
it
became
the
property
of
a
young
girl
who
wore
it
only
once
then
she
also
sickened
and
talked
of
a
beautiful
shadow
and
died
and
was
buried
and
the
robe
was
given
a
third
time
to
the
temple
and
the
priest
wondered
and
doubted
nevertheless
he
ventured
to
sell
the
luckless
garment
once
more
once
more
it
was
purchased
by
a
girl
and
once
more
worn
and
the
wearer
pined
and
died
and
the
robe
was
given
a
fourth
time
to
the
temple
then
the
priest
felt
sure
that
there
was
some
evil
influence
at
work
and
he
told
his
acolytes
to
make
a
fire
in
the
court
and
to
burn
the
robe
so
they
made
a
fire
into
which
the
robe
was
thrown
but
as
the
silk
began
to
burn
there
suddenly
appeared
upon
it
dazzling
characters
of
flame
the
characters
of
the
invocation
namu
myo
ho
rengé
kyo
and
these
one
by
one
leaped
like
great
sparks
to
the
temple
roof
and
the
temple
took
fire
embers
from
the
burning
temple
presently
dropped
upon
neighbouring
roofs
and
the
whole
street
was
soon
ablaze
then
a
rising
blew
destruction
into
further
streets
and
the
conflagration
spread
from
street
to
street
and
from
district
into
district
till
nearly
the
whole
of
the
city
was
consumed
and
this
calamity
which
occurred
upon
the
eighteenth
day
of
the
first
month
of
the
first
year
of
meireki
is
still
remembered
in
tokyo
as
the
the
great
fire
of
the
robe
according
to
a
called
the
name
of
the
girl
who
caused
the
robe
to
be
made
was
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
hikoyemon
a
of
in
the
district
of
azabu
because
of
her
beauty
she
was
also
called
or
the
komachi
of
azabu
the
same
book
says
that
the
temple
of
the
tradition
was
a
nichiren
temple
called
in
the
district
of
hongo
and
that
the
crest
upon
the
robe
was
a
but
there
are
many
different
versions
of
the
story
and
i
distrust
the
because
it
asserts
that
the
beautiful
samurai
was
not
really
a
man
but
a
transformed
dragon
or
that
used
to
inhabit
the
lake
at
uyeno
after
more
than
a
thousand
years
the
name
of
komachi
or
komachi
is
still
celebrated
in
japan
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
of
her
time
and
so
great
a
poet
that
she
could
move
heaven
by
her
verses
and
cause
rain
to
fall
in
time
of
drought
many
men
loved
her
in
vain
and
many
are
said
to
have
died
for
love
of
her
but
misfortunes
visited
her
when
her
youth
had
passed
and
after
having
been
reduced
to
the
uttermost
want
she
became
a
beggar
and
died
at
last
upon
the
public
highway
near
kyoto
as
it
was
thought
shameful
to
bury
her
in
the
foul
rags
found
upon
her
some
poor
person
gave
a
wornout
katabira
to
wrap
her
body
in
and
she
was
interred
near
arashiyama
at
a
spot
still
pointed
out
to
travellers
as
the
place
of
the
katabira
incense
i
see
rising
out
of
darkness
a
lotos
in
a
vase
most
of
the
vase
is
invisible
but
i
know
that
it
is
of
bronze
and
that
its
glimpsing
handles
are
bodies
of
dragons
only
the
lotos
is
fully
illuminated
three
pure
white
flowers
and
five
great
leaves
of
gold
and
green
gold
above
green
on
the
upcurling
an
artificial
lotos
it
is
bathed
by
a
slanting
stream
of
sunshine
the
darkness
beneath
and
beyond
is
the
dusk
of
a
i
do
not
see
the
opening
through
which
the
radiance
pours
but
i
am
aware
that
it
is
a
small
window
shaped
in
the
of
a
the
reason
that
i
see
the
lotos
one
memory
of
my
first
visit
to
a
buddhist
sanctuary
is
that
there
has
come
to
me
an
odor
of
incense
often
when
i
smell
incense
this
vision
defines
and
usually
thereafter
other
sensations
of
my
first
day
in
japan
revive
in
swift
succession
with
almost
painful
acuteness
it
is
almost
ubiquitous
this
perfume
of
incense
it
makes
one
element
of
the
faint
but
complex
and
odor
of
the
far
east
it
haunts
the
not
less
than
the
temple
the
home
of
the
peasant
not
less
than
the
yashiki
of
the
prince
shinto
shrines
indeed
are
free
from
it
incense
being
an
abomination
to
the
elder
gods
but
wherever
buddhism
lives
there
is
incense
in
every
house
containing
a
buddhist
shrine
or
buddhist
tablets
incense
is
burned
at
certain
times
and
in
even
the
rudest
country
solitudes
you
will
find
incense
smouldering
before
wayside
images
little
stone
figures
of
fudo
jizo
or
kwannon
many
experiences
of
travel
strange
impressions
of
sound
as
well
as
of
sight
remain
associated
in
my
own
memory
with
that
fragrance
vast
silent
shadowed
avenues
leading
to
weird
old
shrines
mossed
flights
of
worn
steps
ascending
to
temples
that
moulder
above
the
clouds
joyous
tumult
of
festival
nights
sheeted
gliding
by
in
glimmer
of
lanterns
murmur
of
household
prayer
in
fishermen
huts
on
far
wild
coasts
and
visions
of
desolate
little
graves
marked
only
by
threads
of
blue
smoke
ascending
graves
of
pet
animals
or
birds
remembered
by
simple
hearts
in
the
hour
of
prayer
to
amida
the
lord
of
immeasurable
light
but
the
odor
of
which
i
speak
is
that
of
cheap
incense
only
the
incense
in
general
use
there
are
many
other
kinds
of
incense
and
the
range
of
quality
is
amazing
a
bundle
of
common
rods
they
are
about
as
thick
as
an
ordinary
and
somewhat
longer
can
be
bought
for
a
few
sen
while
a
bundle
of
better
quality
presenting
to
inexperienced
eyes
only
some
difference
in
color
may
cost
several
yen
and
be
cheap
at
the
price
still
costlier
sorts
of
incense
veritable
luxuries
take
the
form
of
lozenges
wafers
pastilles
and
a
small
envelope
of
such
material
may
be
worth
four
or
five
sterling
but
the
commercial
and
industrial
questions
relating
to
japanese
incense
represent
the
least
interesting
part
of
a
remarkably
curious
subject
ii
curious
indeed
but
enormous
by
reason
of
it
infinity
of
tradition
and
detail
i
am
afraid
even
to
think
of
the
size
of
the
volume
that
would
be
needed
to
cover
it
such
a
work
would
properly
begin
with
some
brief
account
of
the
earliest
knowledge
and
use
of
aromatics
in
japan
i
would
next
treat
of
the
records
and
legends
of
the
first
introduction
of
buddhist
incense
fron
korea
when
king
shomyo
of
kudara
in
sent
to
the
a
collection
of
sutras
an
image
of
the
buddha
and
one
complete
set
of
furniture
for
a
temple
then
something
would
have
to
be
said
about
those
classifications
of
incense
which
were
made
during
the
tenth
century
in
the
periods
of
engi
and
of
tenryaku
and
about
the
report
of
the
ancient
who
visited
china
in
the
latter
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
transmitted
to
the
emperor
yomei
the
wisdom
of
the
chinese
concerning
incense
then
mention
should
be
made
of
the
ancient
incenses
still
preserved
in
various
japanese
temples
and
of
the
famous
fragments
of
ranjatai
publicly
exhibited
at
nara
in
the
tenth
year
of
meiji
which
furnished
supplies
to
the
three
great
captains
nobunaga
hideyoshi
and
iyeyasu
after
this
should
an
outline
of
the
history
of
mixed
incenses
made
in
japan
with
notes
on
the
classifications
devised
by
the
luxurious
takauji
and
on
the
nomenclature
established
later
by
ashikaga
yoshimasa
who
collected
one
hundred
and
thirty
varieties
of
incense
and
invented
for
the
more
precious
of
them
names
recognized
even
to
this
day
such
as
and
law
examples
ought
to
be
given
likewise
of
traditions
attaching
to
historical
incenses
preserved
in
several
princely
families
together
with
specimens
of
those
hereditary
recipes
for
making
which
have
been
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
through
hundreds
of
years
and
are
still
called
after
their
august
inventors
as
the
method
of
the
method
of
etc
recipes
also
should
be
given
of
those
strange
incenses
made
to
imitate
the
perfume
of
the
lotos
the
smell
of
the
summer
breeze
and
the
odor
of
the
autumn
wind
some
legends
of
the
great
period
of
should
be
cited
such
as
the
story
of
sue
who
built
for
himself
a
palace
of
and
set
fire
to
it
on
the
night
of
his
revolt
when
the
smoke
of
its
burning
perfumed
the
land
to
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
of
course
the
mere
compilation
of
materials
for
a
history
of
would
entail
the
study
of
a
host
of
documents
treatises
and
books
particularly
of
such
strange
works
as
the
or
containing
the
teachings
of
the
ten
schools
of
the
art
of
mixing
incense
directions
as
to
the
best
seasons
for
and
instructions
about
the
different
kinds
of
fire
to
be
used
for
burning
incense
one
kind
is
called
literary
fire
and
another
military
fire
together
with
rules
for
pressing
the
ashes
of
a
censer
into
various
artistic
designs
corresponding
to
season
and
occasion
a
special
chapter
should
certainly
be
given
to
the
kusadama
hung
up
in
houses
to
drive
away
goblins
and
to
the
smaller
formerly
carried
about
the
person
as
a
protection
against
evil
spirits
then
a
very
large
part
of
the
work
would
have
to
be
devoted
to
the
religious
uses
and
legends
of
incense
a
huge
subject
in
itself
there
would
also
have
to
be
considered
the
curious
history
of
the
old
whose
elaborate
ceremonial
could
be
explained
only
by
help
of
numerous
diagrams
one
chapter
at
least
would
be
required
for
the
subject
of
the
ancient
importation
of
from
india
china
annam
siam
cambodia
ceylon
sumatra
java
borneo
and
various
islands
of
the
malay
archipelago
places
all
named
in
rare
books
about
incense
and
a
final
chapter
should
treat
of
the
romantic
literature
of
incense
the
poems
stories
and
dramas
in
which
are
mentioned
and
especially
those
comparing
the
body
to
incense
and
passion
to
the
eating
flame
even
as
burns
the
perfume
lending
thy
robe
its
fragance
smoulders
my
life
away
consumed
by
the
pain
of
longing
merest
outline
of
the
subject
is
terrifying
i
shall
attempt
nothing
more
than
a
few
notes
about
the
religious
the
luxurious
and
the
ghostly
uses
of
incense
iii
the
common
incense
everywhere
burned
by
poor
people
before
buddhist
icons
is
called
this
is
very
cheap
great
quantities
of
it
are
burned
by
pilgrims
in
the
bronze
censers
set
before
the
entrances
of
famous
temples
and
in
front
of
roadside
images
you
may
often
see
bundles
of
it
these
are
for
the
use
of
pious
wayfarers
who
pause
before
every
buddhist
image
on
their
path
to
repeat
a
brief
prayer
and
when
possible
to
set
a
few
rods
smouldering
at
the
feet
of
the
statue
but
in
rich
temples
and
during
great
religious
ceremonies
much
more
expensive
incense
is
used
altogether
three
classes
of
perfumes
are
employed
in
buddhist
rites
ko
or
in
many
varieties
the
word
literally
means
only
fragrant
substance
dzuko
an
odorous
ointment
and
makko
a
fragrant
powder
ko
is
burned
dzuko
is
rubbed
upon
the
hands
of
the
priest
as
an
ointment
of
purification
and
makko
is
sprinkled
about
the
sanctuary
this
makko
is
said
to
be
identical
with
the
so
frequently
mentioned
in
buddhist
texts
but
it
is
only
the
true
incense
which
can
be
said
to
bear
an
important
relation
to
the
religious
service
incense
declares
the
is
the
messenger
of
earnest
desire
when
the
rich
sudatta
wished
to
invite
the
buddha
to
a
repast
he
made
use
of
incense
he
was
wont
to
ascend
to
the
roof
of
his
house
on
the
eve
of
the
day
of
the
entertainment
and
to
remain
standing
there
all
night
holding
a
censer
of
precious
incense
and
as
often
as
he
did
thus
the
buddha
never
failed
to
come
on
the
following
day
at
the
exact
time
desired
this
text
plainly
implies
that
incense
as
a
symbolizes
the
pious
desires
of
the
faithful
but
it
symbolizes
other
things
also
and
it
has
furnished
many
remarkable
similes
to
buddhist
literature
some
of
these
and
not
the
least
interesting
occur
in
prayers
of
which
the
following
from
the
book
called
is
a
striking
example
let
my
body
remain
pure
like
a
censer
let
my
thought
be
ever
as
a
fire
of
wisdom
purely
consuming
the
incense
of
sila
and
of
dhyana
that
so
may
i
do
homage
to
all
the
buddhas
in
the
ten
directions
of
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
sometimes
in
buddhist
sermons
the
destruction
of
karma
by
virtuous
effort
is
likened
to
the
burning
of
incense
by
a
pure
flame
sometimes
again
the
life
of
man
is
compared
to
the
smoke
of
incense
in
his
hundred
writings
kami
the
shinshu
priest
myoden
says
quoting
from
the
buddhist
work
kujikkajo
or
ninety
articles
in
the
burning
of
incense
we
see
that
so
long
as
any
incense
remains
so
long
does
the
burning
continue
and
the
smoke
mount
skyward
now
the
breath
of
this
body
of
ours
this
impermanent
combination
of
earth
water
air
and
fire
is
like
that
smoke
and
the
changing
of
the
incense
into
cold
ashes
when
the
flame
expires
is
an
emblem
of
the
changing
of
our
bodies
into
ashes
when
our
funeral
pyres
have
burnt
themselves
out
he
also
tells
us
about
that
of
which
every
believer
ought
to
be
reminded
by
the
perfume
of
earthly
incense
in
the
second
vow
for
the
attainment
of
the
paradise
of
wondrous
incense
he
says
it
is
written
paradise
is
formed
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
different
kinds
of
incense
and
of
substances
incalculably
precious
the
beauty
of
it
incomparably
exceeds
anything
in
the
heavens
or
in
the
sphere
of
man
the
fragrance
of
it
perfumes
all
the
worlds
of
the
ten
directions
of
space
and
all
who
perceive
that
odor
practise
in
ancient
times
there
were
men
of
superior
wisdom
and
virtue
who
by
reason
of
their
vow
obtained
perception
of
the
odor
but
we
who
are
born
with
inferior
wisdom
and
virtue
in
these
later
days
can
not
obtain
such
perception
nevertheless
it
will
be
well
for
us
when
we
smell
the
incense
kindled
before
the
image
of
amida
to
imagine
that
its
odor
is
the
wonderful
fragrance
of
paradise
and
to
repeat
the
nembutsu
in
gratitude
for
the
mercy
of
the
buddha
short
or
epitomized
history
of
priests
the
praise
of
pious
observances
by
sila
is
meant
the
observance
of
the
rules
of
purity
in
act
and
thought
dhyana
called
by
japanese
buddhists
zenjo
is
one
of
the
higher
forms
of
meditation
iv
but
the
use
of
incense
in
japan
is
not
confined
to
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
indeed
the
costlier
kinds
of
incense
are
manufactured
chiefly
for
social
entertainments
has
been
an
amusement
of
the
aristocracy
ever
since
the
thirteenth
century
probably
you
have
heard
of
the
japanese
ceremonies
and
their
curious
buddhist
history
and
i
suppose
that
every
foreign
collector
of
japanese
knows
something
about
the
luxury
to
which
these
ceremonies
at
one
period
attained
a
luxury
well
attested
by
the
quality
of
the
beautiful
utensils
formerly
employed
in
them
but
there
were
and
still
are
much
more
elaborate
and
costly
than
the
and
also
much
more
interesting
besides
music
embroidery
poetical
composition
and
other
branches
of
the
female
education
the
young
lady
of
days
was
expected
to
acquire
three
especially
polite
accomplishments
the
art
of
arranging
flowers
ikebana
the
art
of
ceremonial
or
and
the
etiquette
of
or
were
invented
before
the
time
of
the
ashikaga
shoguns
and
were
most
in
vogue
during
the
peaceful
period
of
the
tokugawa
rule
with
the
fall
of
the
shogunate
they
went
out
of
fashion
but
recently
they
have
been
to
some
extent
revived
it
is
not
likely
however
that
they
will
again
become
really
fashionable
in
the
old
sense
partly
because
they
represented
rare
forms
of
social
refinement
that
never
can
be
revived
and
partly
because
of
their
costliness
in
translating
as
i
use
the
word
party
in
the
meaning
that
it
takes
in
such
compounds
as
for
a
is
a
meeting
held
only
with
the
object
of
playing
a
game
a
very
curious
game
there
are
several
kinds
of
but
in
all
of
them
the
contest
depends
upon
the
ability
to
remember
and
to
name
different
kinds
of
incense
by
the
perfume
alone
that
variety
of
called
is
generally
conceded
to
be
the
most
amusing
and
i
shall
try
to
tell
you
how
it
is
played
the
numeral
ten
in
the
japanese
or
rather
chinese
name
of
this
diversion
does
not
refer
to
ten
kinds
but
only
to
ten
packages
of
incense
for
besides
being
the
most
amusing
is
the
very
simplest
of
and
is
played
with
only
four
kinds
of
incense
one
kind
must
be
supplied
by
the
guests
invited
to
the
party
and
three
are
furnished
by
the
person
who
gives
the
entertainment
each
of
the
latter
three
supplies
of
incense
usually
prepared
in
packages
containing
one
hundred
wafers
is
divided
into
four
parts
and
each
part
is
put
into
a
separate
paper
numbered
or
marked
so
as
to
indicate
the
quality
thus
four
packages
are
prepared
of
the
incense
classed
as
no
four
of
incense
no
and
four
of
incense
no
or
twelve
in
all
but
the
incense
given
by
the
guests
always
called
is
not
divided
it
is
only
put
into
a
wrapper
marked
with
an
abbreviation
of
the
chinese
character
signifying
guest
accordingly
we
have
a
total
of
thirteen
packages
to
start
with
but
three
are
to
be
used
in
the
preliminary
sampling
or
experimenting
as
the
japanese
term
it
after
the
following
manner
we
shall
suppose
the
game
to
be
arranged
for
a
party
of
six
though
there
is
no
rule
limiting
the
number
of
players
the
six
take
their
places
in
line
or
in
a
if
the
room
be
small
but
they
do
not
sit
close
together
for
reasons
which
will
presently
appear
then
the
host
or
the
person
appointed
to
act
as
prepares
a
package
of
the
incense
classed
as
no
kindles
it
in
a
censer
and
passes
the
censer
to
the
guest
occupying
the
first
seat
with
the
announcement
this
is
incense
no
the
guest
receives
the
censer
according
to
the
graceful
etiquette
required
in
the
inhales
the
perfume
and
passes
on
the
vessel
to
his
neighbor
who
receives
it
in
like
manner
and
passes
it
to
the
third
guest
who
presents
it
to
the
fourth
and
so
on
when
the
censer
has
gone
the
round
of
the
party
it
is
returned
to
the
one
package
of
incense
no
and
one
of
no
are
similarly
prepared
announced
and
tested
but
with
the
no
experiment
is
made
the
player
should
be
able
to
remember
the
different
odors
of
the
incenses
tested
and
he
is
expected
to
identify
the
at
the
proper
time
merely
by
the
unfamiliar
quality
of
its
fragrance
the
original
thirteen
packages
having
thus
by
experimenting
been
reduced
to
ten
each
player
is
given
one
set
of
ten
small
tablets
usually
of
every
set
being
differently
ornamented
the
backs
only
of
these
tablets
are
decorated
and
the
decoration
is
nearly
always
a
floral
design
of
some
sort
thus
one
set
might
be
decorated
with
chrysanthemums
in
gold
another
with
tufts
of
another
with
a
spray
of
blossoms
etc
but
the
faces
of
the
tablets
bear
numbers
or
marks
and
each
set
comprises
three
tablets
numbered
three
numbered
three
numbered
and
one
marked
with
the
character
signifying
guest
after
these
have
been
distributed
a
box
called
the
is
placed
before
the
first
player
and
all
is
ready
for
the
real
game
the
retires
behind
a
little
screen
shuffles
the
flat
packages
like
so
many
cards
takes
the
uppermost
prepares
its
contents
in
the
censer
and
then
returning
to
the
party
sends
the
censer
upon
its
round
this
time
of
course
he
does
not
announce
what
kind
of
incense
he
has
used
as
the
censer
passes
from
hand
to
hand
each
player
after
inhaling
the
fume
puts
into
the
one
tablet
bearing
that
mark
or
number
which
he
supposes
to
be
the
mark
or
number
of
the
incense
he
has
smelled
if
for
example
he
thinks
the
incense
to
be
incense
he
drops
into
the
box
that
one
of
his
tablets
marked
with
the
ideograph
meaning
guest
or
if
he
believes
that
he
has
inhaled
the
perfume
of
no
he
puts
into
the
box
a
tablet
numbered
when
the
round
is
over
and
censer
are
both
returned
to
the
he
takes
the
six
tablets
out
of
the
box
and
wraps
them
up
in
the
paper
which
contained
the
incense
guessed
about
the
tablets
themselves
keep
the
personal
as
well
as
the
general
record
since
each
player
remembers
the
particular
design
upon
his
own
set
the
remaining
nine
packages
of
incense
art
consumed
and
judged
in
the
same
way
according
to
the
chance
order
in
which
the
shuffling
has
placed
them
when
all
the
incense
has
been
used
the
tablets
are
taken
out
of
their
wrappings
the
record
is
officially
put
into
writing
and
the
victor
of
the
day
is
announced
i
here
offer
the
translation
of
such
a
record
it
will
serve
to
explain
almost
at
a
glance
all
the
complications
of
the
game
according
to
this
record
the
player
who
used
the
tablets
decorated
with
the
design
called
young
pine
made
but
two
mistakes
while
the
holder
of
the
set
made
only
one
correct

but
it
is
quite
a
feat
to
make
ten
correct
judgments
in
succession
the
olfactory
nerves
are
apt
to
become
somewhat
numbed
long
before
the
game
is
concluded
and
therefore
it
is
customary
during
the
to
rinse
the
mouth
at
intervals

pure
vinegar

to
refer
immediately
to
any
interesting
fact
belonging
to
the
history
of
any
past
game
the
reader
will
have
noticed
that
the
four
kinds
of
incense
used
were
designated
by
very
pretty
names
the
incense

mentioned

perhaps
some
curiosity

be

foreign
incense

rarely

little
of

priceless
material

the

very
complex

ancient

this
subject

interest
few
readers

only
mention
some
of
the
rules
regarding
preparations
and
precautions
first
of
all
it
is
required
that
the
person
invited
to
an
shall
attend
the
same
in
as
a
condition
as
possible
a
lady
for
instance
must
not
use
or
put
on
any
dress
that
has
been
kept
in
a
perfumed
furthermore
the
guest
should
prepare
for
the
contest
by
taking
a
prolonged
hot
bath
and
should
eat
only
the
lightest
and
least
odorous
kind
of
food
before
going
to
the
rendezvous
it
is
forbidden
to
leave
the
room
during
the
game
or
to
open
any
door
or
window
or
to
indulge
in
needless
conversation
finally
i
may
observe
that
while
judging
the
incense
a
player
is
expected
to
take
not
less
than
three
inhalations
or
more
than
five
in
this
economical
era
the
takes
of
necessity
a
much
humbler
form
than
it
assumed
in
the
time
of
the
great
daimyo
of
the
princely
abbots
and
of
the
military
aristocracy
a
full
set
of
the
utensils
required
for
the
game
can
now
be
had
for
about
but
the
materials
are
of
the
poorest
kind
the
fashioned
sets
were
fantastically
expensive
some
were
worth
thousands
of
dollars
the
desk
the
box
the
various
stands
or
dai
were
of
the
costliest
the
pincers
and
other
instruments
were
of
gold
curiously
worked
and
the
censer
whether
of
precious
metal
bronze
or
porcelain
was
always
a
designed
by
some
artist
of
renown
girls
are
still
trained
in
the
art
of
arranging
flowers
and
in
the
etiquette
of
the
dainty
though
somewhat
tedious
buddhist
priests
have
long
enjoyed
a
reputation
as
teachers
of
the
latter
when
the
pupil
has
reached
a
certain
degree
of
proficiency
she
is
given
a
diploma
or
certificate
the
tea
used
in
these
ceremonies
is
a
powdered
tea
of
remarkable
fragrance
the
best
qualities
of
which
fetch
very
high
prices
the
places
occupied
by
guests
in
a
japanese
zashiki
or
reception
room
are
numbered
from
the
alcove
of
the
apartment
the
place
of
the
most
honored
is
immediately
before
the
alcove
this
is
the
first
seat
and
the
rest
are
numbered
from
it
usually
to
the
left
v
although
the
original
signification
of
incense
in
buddhist
ceremonies
was
chiefly
symbolical
there
is
good
reason
to
suppose
that
various
beliefs
older
than
buddhism
some
perhaps
peculiar
to
the
race
others
probably
of
chinese
or
korean
derivation
began
at
an
early
period
to
influence
the
popular
use
of
incense
in
japan
incense
is
still
burned
in
the
presence
of
a
corpse
with
the
idea
that
its
fragrance
shields
both
corpse
and
soul
from
malevolent
demons
and
by
the
peasants
it
is
often
burned
also
to
drive
away
goblins
and
the
evil
powers
presiding
over
diseases
but
formerly
it
was
used
to
summon
spirits
as
well
as
to
banish
them
allusions
to
its
employment
in
various
weird
rites
may
be
found
in
some
of
the
old
dramas
and
romances
one
particular
sort
of
incense
imported
from
china
was
said
to
have
the
power
of
calling
up
human
spirits
this
was
the
referred
to
in
such
ancient
as
the
following
i
have
heard
of
the
magical
incense
that
summons
the
souls
of
the
absent
would
i
had
some
to
burn
in
the
nights
when
i
wait
alone
there
is
an
interesting
mention
of
this
incense
in
the
chinese
book
it
was
called
by
japanese
pronunciation
or
and
it
was
made
in
or
the
district
of
the
ancestors
situated
by
the
eastern
sea
to
summon
the
ghost
of
any
dead
person
or
even
that
of
a
living
person
according
to
some
authorities
it
was
only
necessary
to
kindle
some
of
the
incense
and
to
pronounce
certain
words
while
keeping
the
mind
fixed
upon
the
memory
of
that
person
then
in
the
smoke
of
the
incense
the
remembered
face
and
form
would
appear
in
many
old
japanese
and
chinese
books
mention
is
made
of
a
famous
story
about
this
incense
a
story
of
the
chinese
emperor
wu
of
the
han
dynasty
when
the
emperor
had
lost
his
beautiful
favorite
the
lady
li
he
sorrowed
so
much
that
fears
were
entertained
for
his
reason
but
all
efforts
made
to
divert
his
mind
from
the
thought
of
her
proved
unavailing
one
day
he
ordered
some
to
be
procured
that
he
might
summon
her
from
the
dead
his
counsellors
prayed
him
to
forego
his
purpose
declaring
that
the
vision
could
only
intensify
his
grief
but
he
gave
no
heed
to
their
advice
and
himself
performed
the
rite
kindling
the
incense
and
keeping
his
mind
fixed
upon
the
memory
of
the
lady
li
presently
within
the
thick
blue
smoke
arising
from
the
incense
the
outline
of
a
feminine
form
became
visible
it
defined
took
tints
of
life
slowly
became
luminous
and
the
emperor
recognized
the
form
of
his
beloved
at
first
the
apparition
was
faint
but
it
soon
became
distinct
as
a
living
person
and
seemed
with
each
moment
to
grow
more
beautiful
the
emperor
whispered
to
the
vision
but
received
no
answer
he
called
aloud
and
the
presence
made
no
sign
then
unable
to
control
himself
he
approached
the
censer
but
the
instant
that
he
touched
the
smoke
the
phantom
trembled
and
vanished
japanese
artists
are
still
occasionally
inspired
by
the
legends
of
the
only
last
year
in
tokyo
at
an
exhibition
of
new
kakemono
i
saw
a
picture
of
a
young
wife
kneeling
before
an
alcove
wherein
the
smoke
of
the
magical
incense
was
shaping
the
shadow
of
the
absent
husband
although
the
power
of
making
visible
the
forms
of
the
dead
has
been
claimed
for
one
sort
of
incense
only
the
burning
of
any
kind
of
incense
is
supposed
to
summon
viewless
spirits
in
multitude
these
come
to
devour
the
smoke
they
are
called
or
goblins
and
they
belong
to
the
fourteenth
of
the
classes
of
gaki
pretas
recognized
by
japanese
buddhism
they
are
the
ghosts
of
men
who
anciently
for
the
sake
of
gain
made
or
sold
bad
incense
and
by
the
evil
karma
of
that
action
they
now
find
themselves
in
the
state
of
spirits
and
compelled
to
seek
their
only
food
in
the
smoke
of
incense
among
the
curious
tokyo
inventions
of
was
a
new
variety
of
cigarettes
called
or
herb
of
hangon
a
name
suggesting
that
their
smoke
operated
like
the
incense
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
chemical
action
of
the
smoke
would
define
upon
a
paper
fitted
into
the
of
each
cigarette
the
photographic
image
of
a
a
story
of
divination
i
once
knew
a
who
really
believed
in
the
science
that
he
professed
he
had
learned
as
a
student
of
the
old
chinese
philosophy
to
believe
in
divination
long
before
he
thought
of
practising
it
during
his
youth
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
a
wealthy
daimyo
but
subsequently
like
thousands
of
other
samurai
found
himself
reduced
to
desperate
straits
by
the
social
and
political
changes
of
meiji
it
was
then
that
he
became
a
an
itinerant
uranaiya
travelling
on
foot
from
town
to
town
and
returning
to
his
home
rarely
more
than
once
a
year
with
the
proceeds
of
his
journey
as
a
he
was
tolerably
successful
chiefly
i
think
because
of
his
perfect
sincerity
and
because
of
a
peculiar
gentle
manner
that
invited
confidence
his
system
was
the
old
scholarly
one
he
used
the
book
known
to
english
readers
as
the
also
a
set
of
ebony
blocks
which
could
be
so
arranged
as
to
form
any
of
the
chinese
hexagrams
and
he
always
began
his
divination
with
an
earnest
prayer
to
the
gods
the
system
itself
he
held
to
be
infallible
in
the
hands
of
a
master
he
confessed
that
he
had
made
some
erroneous
predictions
but
he
said
that
these
mistakes
had
been
entirely
due
to
his
own
miscomprehension
of
certain
texts
or
diagrams
to
do
him
justice
i
must
mention
that
in
my
own
case
he
told
my
fortune
four
times
his
predictions
were
fulfilled
in
such
wise
that
i
became
afraid
of
them
you
may
disbelieve
in
intellectually
scorn
it
but
something
of
inherited
superstitious
tendency
lurks
within
most
of
us
and
a
few
strange
experiences
can
so
appeal
to
that
inheritance
as
to
induce
the
most
unreasoning
hope
or
fear
of
the
good
or
bad
luck
promised
you
by
some
diviner
really
to
see
our
future
would
be
a
misery
imagine
the
result
of
knowing
that
there
must
happen
to
you
within
the
next
two
months
some
terrible
misfortune
which
you
can
not
possibly
provide
against
he
was
already
an
old
man
when
i
first
saw
him
in
izumo
certainly
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
but
looking
very
much
younger
afterwards
i
met
him
in
osaka
in
kyoto
and
in
kobe
more
than
once
i
tried
to
persuade
him
to
pass
the
colder
months
of
the
under
my
roof
for
he
possessed
an
extraordinary
knowledge
of
traditions
and
could
have
been
of
inestimable
service
to
me
in
a
literary
way
but
partly
because
the
habit
of
wandering
had
become
with
him
a
second
nature
and
partly
because
of
a
love
of
independence
as
savage
as
a
gipsy
i
was
never
able
to
keep
him
with
me
for
more
than
two
days
at
a
time
every
year
he
used
to
come
to
tokyo
usually
in
the
latter
part
of
autumn
then
for
several
weeks
he
would
flit
about
the
city
from
district
to
district
and
vanish
again
but
during
these
fugitive
trips
he
never
failed
to
visit
me
bringing
welcome
news
of
izumo
people
and
places
bringing
also
some
queer
little
present
generally
of
a
religious
kind
from
some
famous
place
of
pilgrimage
on
these
occasions
i
could
get
a
few
hours
chat
with
him
sometimes
the
talk
was
of
strange
things
seen
or
heard
during
his
recent
journey
sometimes
it
turned
upon
old
legends
or
beliefs
sometimes
it
was
about
the
last
time
we
met
he
told
me
of
an
exact
chinese
science
of
divination
which
he
regretted
never
having
been
able
to
learn
any
one
learned
in
that
science
he
said
would
be
able
for
example
not
only
to
tell
you
the
exact
time
at
which
any
post
or
beam
of
this
house
will
yield
to
decay
but
even
to
tell
you
the
direction
of
the
breaking
and
all
its
results
i
can
best
explain
what
i
mean
by
relating
a
story
the
story
is
about
the
famous
chinese
whom
we
call
in
japan
shoko
setsu
and
it
is
written
in
the
book
which
is
a
book
of
divination
while
still
a
very
young
man
shoko
setsu
obtained
a
high
position
by
reason
of
his
learning
and
virtue
but
he
resigned
it
and
went
into
solitude
that
he
might
give
his
whole
time
to
study
for
years
thereafter
he
lived
alone
in
a
hut
among
the
mountains
studying
without
a
fire
in
winter
and
without
a
fan
in
summer
writing
his
thoughts
upon
the
wall
of
his
room
for
lack
of
paper
and
using
only
a
tile
for
his
pillow
one
day
in
the
period
of
greatest
summer
heat
he
found
himself
overcome
by
drowsiness
and
he
lay
down
to
rest
with
his
tile
under
his
head
scarcely
had
he
fallen
asleep
when
a
rat
ran
across
his
face
and
woke
him
with
a
start
feeling
angry
he
seized
his
tile
and
flung
it
at
the
rat
but
the
rat
escaped
unhurt
and
the
tile
was
broken
shoko
setsu
looked
sorrowfully
at
the
fragments
of
his
pillow
and
reproached
himself
for
his
hastiness
then
suddenly
he
perceived
upon
the
freshly
exposed
clay
of
the
broken
tile
some
chinese
characters
between
the
upper
and
lower
surfaces
thinking
this
very
strange
he
picked
up
the
pieces
and
carefully
examined
them
he
found
that
along
the
line
of
fracture
seventeen
characters
had
been
written
within
the
clay
before
the
tile
had
been
baked
and
the
characters
read
thus
the
year
of
the
hare
in
the
fourth
month
on
the
seventeenth
day
at
the
hour
of
the
serpent
this
tile
after
serving
as
a
pillow
will
be
thrown
at
a
rat
and
broken
now
the
prediction
had
really
been
fulfilled
at
the
hour
of
the
serpent
on
the
seventeenth
day
of
the
fourth
month
of
the
year
of
the
hare
greatly
astonished
shoko
setsu
once
again
looked
at
the
fragments
and
discovered
the
seal
and
the
name
of
the
maker
at
once
he
left
his
hut
and
taking
with
him
the
pieces
of
the
tile
hurried
to
the
neighboring
town
in
search
of
the
tilemaker
he
found
the
tilemaker
in
the
course
of
the
day
showed
him
the
broken
tile
and
asked
him
about
its
history
after
having
carefully
examined
the
shards
the
tilemaker
said
tile
was
made
in
my
house
but
the
characters
in
the
clay
were
written
by
an
old
man
a
who
asked
permission
to
write
upon
the
tile
before
it
was
baked
you
know
where
he
lives
asked
shoko
setsu
used
to
live
the
tilemaker
answered
very
far
from
here
and
i
can
show
you
the
way
to
the
house
but
i
do
not
know
his
name
having
been
guided
to
the
house
shoko
setsu
presented
himself
at
the
entrance
and
asked
for
permission
to
speak
to
the
old
man
a
courteously
invited
him
to
enter
and
ushered
him
into
an
apartment
where
several
young
men
were
at
study
as
shoko
setsu
took
his
seat
all
the
youths
saluted
him
then
the
one
who
had
first
addressed
him
bowed
and
said
are
grieved
to
inform
you
that
our
master
died
a
few
days
ago
but
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
because
he
predicted
that
you
would
come
to
this
house
at
this
very
hour
your
name
is
shoko
setsu
and
our
master
told
us
to
give
you
a
book
which
he
believed
would
be
of
service
to
you
here
is
the
book
please
to
accept
it
shoko
setsu
was
not
less
delighted
than
surprised
for
the
book
was
a
manuscript
of
the
rarest
and
most
precious
kind
containing
all
the
secrets
of
the
science
of
divination
after
having
thanked
the
young
men
and
properly
expressed
his
regret
for
the
death
of
their
teacher
he
went
back
to
his
hut
and
there
immediately
proceeded
to
test
the
worth
of
the
book
by
consulting
its
pages
in
regard
to
his
own
fortune
the
book
suggested
to
him
that
on
the
south
side
of
his
dwelling
at
a
particular
spot
near
one
corner
of
the
hut
great
luck
awaited
him
he
dug
at
the
place
indicated
and
found
a
jar
containing
gold
enough
to
make
him
a
very
wealthy
man
my
old
acquaintance
left
this
world
as
lonesomely
as
he
had
lived
in
it
last
winter
while
crossing
a
he
was
overtaken
by
a
snowstorm
and
lost
his
way
many
days
later
he
was
found
standing
erect
at
the
foot
of
a
pine
with
his
little
pack
strapped
to
his
shoulders
a
statue
of
ice
arms
folded
and
eyes
closed
as
in
meditation
probably
while
waiting
for
the
storm
to
pass
he
had
yielded
to
the
drowsiness
of
cold
and
the
drift
had
risen
over
him
as
he
slept
hearing
of
this
strange
death
i
remembered
the
old
japanese
saying
uranaiya
minouye
shiradzu
the
knows
not
his
own
fate
silkworms
i
was
puzzled
by
the
phrase
eyebrow
in
an
old
japanese
or
rather
chinese
proverb
the
eyebrow
of
a
woman
is
the
axe
that
cuts
down
the
wisdom
of
man
so
i
went
to
my
friend
niimi
who
keeps
silkworms
to
ask
for
an
explanation
is
it
possible
he
exclaimed
that
you
never
saw
a
moth
the
has
very
beautiful
eyebrows
eyebrows
i
queried
in
astonishment
well
call
them
what
you
like
returned
niimi
the
poets
call
them
eyebrows
wait
a
moment
and
i
will
show
you
he
left
the
and
presently
returned
with
a
white
on
which
a
was
sleepily
reposing
we
always
reserve
a
few
for
breeding
he
said
this
one
is
just
out
of
the
cocoon
it
can
not
fly
of
course
none
of
them
can
fly
now
look
at
the
eyebrows
i
looked
and
saw
that
the
antennae
very
short
and
feathery
were
so
arched
back
over
the
two
of
eyes
in
the
velvety
head
as
to
give
the
appearance
of
a
really
handsome
pair
of
brows
then
niimi
took
me
to
see
his
worms
in
niimi
neighborhood
where
there
are
plenty
of
mulberrytrees
many
families
keep
silkworms
the
tending
and
feeding
being
mostly
done
by
women
and
children
the
worms
are
kept
in
large
oblong
trays
elevated
upon
light
wooden
stands
about
three
feet
high
it
is
curious
to
see
hundreds
of
caterpillars
feeding
all
together
in
one
tray
and
to
hear
the
soft
papery
noise
which
they
make
while
gnawing
their
as
they
approach
maturity
the
creatures
need
almost
constant
attention
at
brief
intervals
some
expert
visits
each
tray
to
inspect
progress
picks
up
the
plumpest
feeders
and
decides
by
gently
rolling
them
between
forefinger
and
thumb
which
are
ready
to
spin
these
are
dropped
into
covered
boxes
where
they
soon
swathe
themselves
out
of
sight
in
white
floss
a
few
only
of
the
best
are
suffered
to
emerge
from
their
silky
sleep
the
selected
breeders
they
have
beautiful
wings
but
can
not
use
them
they
have
mouths
but
do
not
eat
they
only
pair
lay
eggs
and
die
for
thousands
of
years
their
race
has
been
so
for
that
it
can
no
longer
take
any
care
of
itself
it
was
the
evolutional
lesson
of
this
latter
fact
that
chiefly
occupied
me
while
niimi
and
his
younger
brother
who
feeds
the
worms
were
kindly
explaining
the
methods
of
the
industry
they
told
me
curious
things
about
different
breeds
and
also
about
a
wild
variety
of
silkworm
that
can
not
be
domesticated
it
spins
splendid
silk
before
turning
into
a
vigorous
moth
which
can
use
its
wings
to
some
purpose
but
i
fear
that
i
did
not
act
like
a
person
who
felt
interested
in
the
subject
for
even
while
i
tried
to
listen
i
began
to
muse
ii
first
of
all
i
found
myself
thinking
about
a
delightful
revery
by
anatole
france
in
which
he
says
that
if
he
had
been
the
demiurge
he
would
have
put
youth
at
the
end
of
life
instead
of
at
the
beginning
and
would
have
otherwise
so
ordered
matters
that
every
human
being
should
have
three
stages
of
development
somewhat
corresponding
to
those
of
the
lepidoptera
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
fantasy
was
in
substance
scarcely
more
than
the
delicate
modification
of
a
most
ancient
doctrine
common
to
nearly
all
the
higher
forms
of
religion
western
faiths
especially
teach
that
our
life
on
earth
is
a
larval
state
of
greedy
helplessness
and
that
death
is
a
sleep
out
of
which
we
should
soar
into
everlasting
light
they
tell
us
that
during
its
sentient
existence
the
outer
body
should
be
thought
of
only
as
a
kind
of
caterpillar
and
thereafter
as
a
chrysalis
and
they
aver
that
we
lose
or
gain
according
to
our
behavior
as
larvae
the
power
to
develop
wings
under
the
mortal
wrapping
also
they
tell
us
not
to
trouble
ourselves
about
the
fact
that
we
see
no
detach
itself
from
the
broken
cocoon
this
lack
of
visual
evidence
signifies
nothing
because
we
have
only
the
purblind
vision
of
grubs
our
eyes
are
but
evolved
do
not
whole
scales
of
colors
invisibly
exist
above
and
below
the
limits
of
our
retinal
sensibility
even
so
the
exists
although
as
a
matter
of
course
we
can
not
see
him
but
what
would
become
of
this
human
imago
in
a
state
of
perfect
bliss
from
the
evolutional
point
of
view
the
question
has
interest
and
its
obvious
answer
was
suggested
to
me
by
the
history
of
those
silkworms
which
have
been
domesticated
for
only
a
few
thousand
years
consider
the
result
of
our
celestial
domestication
for
let
us
say
several
millions
of
years
i
mean
the
final
consequence
to
the
wishers
of
being
able
to
gratify
every
wish
at
will
those
silkworms
have
all
that
they
wish
for
even
considerably
more
their
wants
though
very
simple
are
fundamentally
identical
with
the
necessities
of
mankind
food
shelter
warmth
safety
and
comfort
our
endless
social
struggle
is
mainly
for
these
things
our
dream
of
heaven
is
the
dream
of
obtaining
them
free
of
cost
in
pain
and
the
condition
of
those
silkworms
is
the
realization
in
a
small
way
of
our
imagined
paradise
i
am
not
considering
the
fact
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
worms
are
predestined
to
torment
and
the
second
death
for
my
theme
is
of
heaven
not
of
lost
souls
i
am
speaking
of
the
elect
those
worms
preordained
to
salvation
and
rebirth
probably
they
can
feel
only
very
weak
sensations
they
are
certainly
incapable
of
prayer
but
if
they
were
able
to
pray
they
could
not
ask
for
anything
more
than
they
already
receive
from
the
youth
who
feeds
and
tends
them
he
is
their
providence
a
god
of
whose
existence
they
can
be
aware
in
only
the
vaguest
possible
way
but
just
such
a
god
as
they
require
and
we
should
foolishly
deem
ourselves
fortunate
to
be
equally
well
in
proportion
to
our
more
complex
wants
do
not
our
common
forms
of
prayer
prove
our
desire
for
like
attention
is
not
the
assertion
of
our
need
of
divine
love
an
involuntary
confession
that
we
wish
to
be
treated
like
silkworms
to
live
without
pain
by
the
help
of
gods
yet
if
the
gods
were
to
treat
us
as
we
want
we
should
presently
afford
fresh
evidence
in
the
way
of
what
is
called
the
evidence
from
degeneration
that
the
great
evolutional
law
is
far
above
the
gods
an
early
stage
of
that
degeneration
would
be
represented
by
total
incapacity
to
help
ourselves
then
we
should
begin
to
lose
the
use
of
our
higher
later
on
the
brain
would
shrink
to
a
vanishing
of
matter
still
later
we
should
dwindle
into
mere
amorphous
sacs
mere
blind
stomachs
such
would
be
the
physical
consequence
of
that
kind
of
divine
love
which
we
so
lazily
wish
for
the
longing
for
perpetual
bliss
in
perpetual
peace
might
well
seem
a
malevolent
inspiration
from
the
lords
of
death
and
darkness
all
life
that
feels
and
thinks
has
been
and
can
continue
to
be
only
as
the
product
of
struggle
and
pain
only
as
the
outcome
of
endless
battle
with
the
powers
of
the
universe
and
cosmic
law
is
uncompromising
whatever
organ
ceases
to
know
pain
whatever
faculty
ceases
to
be
used
under
the
stimulus
of
pain
must
also
cease
to
exist
let
pain
and
its
effort
be
suspended
and
life
must
shrink
back
first
into
protoplasmic
shapelessness
thereafter
into
dust
buddhism
which
in
its
own
grand
way
is
a
doctrine
of
evolution
rationally
proclaims
its
heaven
but
a
higher
stage
of
development
through
pain
and
teaches
that
even
in
paradise
the
cessation
of
effort
produces
degradation
with
equal
reasonableness
it
declares
that
the
capacity
for
pain
in
the
superhuman
world
increases
always
in
proportion
to
the
capacity
for
pleasure
there
is
little
fault
to
be
found
with
this
teaching
from
a
scientific
standpoint
since
we
know
that
higher
evolution
must
involve
an
increase
of
sensitivity
to
pain
in
the
heavens
of
desire
says
the
the
pain
of
death
is
so
great
that
all
the
agonies
of
all
the
hells
united
could
equal
but
part
of
such
pain
the
foregoing
comparison
is
unnecessarily
strong
but
the
buddhist
teaching
about
heaven
is
in
substance
eminently
logical
the
suppression
of
pain
mental
or
physical
in
any
conceivable
state
of
sentient
existence
would
necessarily
involve
the
suppression
also
of
pleasure
and
certainly
all
progress
whether
moral
or
material
depends
upon
the
power
to
meet
and
to
master
pain
in
a
such
as
our
mundane
instincts
lead
us
to
desire
the
seraph
freed
from
the
necessity
of
toil
and
able
to
satisfy
his
every
want
at
will
would
lose
his
wings
at
last
and
sink
back
to
the
condition
of
a
grub
this
statement
refers
only
to
the
heavens
of
sensuous
pleasure
not
to
the
paradise
of
amida
nor
to
those
heavens
into
which
one
enters
by
the
apparitional
birth
but
even
in
the
highest
and
most
immaterial
zones
of
being
in
the
heavens
of
formlessness
the
cessation
of
effort
and
of
the
pain
of
effort
involves
the
penalty
of
rebirth
in
a
lower
state
of
existence
iii
i
told
the
substance
of
my
revery
to
niimi
he
used
to
be
a
great
reader
of
buddhist
books
well
he
said
i
was
reminded
of
a
queer
buddhist
story
by
the
proverb
that
you
asked
me
to
explain
the
eyebrow
of
a
woman
is
the
axe
that
cuts
down
the
wisdom
of
man
according
to
our
doctrine
the
saying
would
be
as
true
of
life
in
heaven
as
of
life
upon
earth
this
is
the
story
when
shaka
dwelt
in
this
world
one
of
his
disciples
called
nanda
was
bewitched
by
the
beauty
of
a
woman
and
shaka
desired
to
save
him
from
the
results
of
this
illusion
so
he
took
nanda
to
a
wild
place
in
the
mountains
where
there
were
apes
and
showed
him
a
very
ugly
female
ape
and
asked
him
is
the
more
beautiful
nanda
the
woman
that
you
love
or
this
female
ape
master
exclaimed
nanda
can
a
lovely
woman
be
compared
with
an
ugly
ape
you
will
presently
find
reason
to
make
the
comparison
yourself
answered
the
buddha
and
instantly
by
supernatural
power
he
ascended
with
nanda
to
the
which
is
the
second
of
the
six
heavens
of
desire
there
within
a
palace
of
jewels
nanda
saw
a
multitude
of
heavenly
maidens
celebrating
some
festival
with
music
and
dance
and
the
beauty
of
the
least
among
them
incomparably
exceeded
that
of
the
fairest
woman
of
earth
master
cried
nanda
wonderful
festival
is
this
some
of
those
people
responded
shaka
so
nanda
questioned
one
of
the
celestial
maidens
and
she
said
to
him
festival
is
to
celebrate
the
good
tidings
that
have
been
brought
to
us
there
is
now
in
the
human
world
among
the
disciples
of
shaka
a
most
excellent
youth
called
nanda
who
is
soon
to
be
reborn
into
this
heaven
and
to
become
our
bridegroom
because
of
his
holy
life
we
wait
for
him
with
rejoicing
this
reply
filled
the
heart
of
nanda
with
delight
then
the
buddha
asked
him
there
any
one
among
these
maidens
nanda
equal
in
beauty
to
the
woman
with
whom
you
have
been
in
love
master
answered
nanda
as
that
woman
surpassed
in
beauty
the
female
ape
that
we
saw
on
the
mountain
so
is
she
herself
surpassed
by
even
the
least
among
these
then
the
buddha
immediately
descended
with
nanda
to
the
depths
of
the
hells
and
took
him
into
a
where
myriads
of
men
and
women
were
being
boiled
alive
in
great
caldrons
and
otherwise
horribly
tormented
by
devils
then
nanda
found
himself
standing
before
a
huge
vessel
which
was
filled
with
molten
metal
and
he
feared
and
wondered
because
this
vessel
had
as
yet
no
occupant
an
idle
devil
sat
beside
it
yawning
nanda
inquired
of
the
buddha
whom
has
this
vessel
been
prepared
the
devil
answered
shaka
nanda
did
so
and
the
devil
said
to
him
is
a
man
called
nanda
now
one
of
shaka
disciples
about
to
be
reborn
into
one
of
the
heavens
on
account
of
his
former
good
actions
but
after
having
there
indulged
himself
he
is
to
be
reborn
in
this
hell
and
his
place
will
be
in
that
pot
i
am
waiting
for
him
sakyamuni
i
give
the
story
substantially
as
it
was
told
to
me
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
compare
it
with
any
published
text
my
friend
says
that
he
has
seen
two
chinese
versions
one
in
the
the
other
in
the
ekottaragamas
in
henry
clarke
warren
buddhism
in
translations
the
most
interesting
and
valuable
single
volume
of
its
kind
that
i
have
ever
seen
there
is
a
pali
version
of
the
legend
which
differs
considerably
from
the
this
nanda
according
to
warren
work
was
a
prince
and
the
younger
of
sakyamuni
a
passional
karma
one
of
the
attractions
of
the
tokyo
stage
is
the
performance
by
the
famous
kikugoro
and
his
company
of
the
or
this
weird
play
of
which
the
scenes
are
laid
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
is
the
dramatization
of
a
romance
by
the
novelist
encho
written
in
colloquial
japanese
and
purely
japanese
in
local
color
though
inspired
by
a
chinese
tale
i
went
to
see
the
play
and
kikugoro
made
me
familiar
with
a
new
variety
of
the
pleasure
of
fear
why
not
give
english
readers
the
ghostly
part
of
the
story
asked
a
friend
who
guides
me
betimes
through
the
mazes
of
eastern
philosophy
it
would
serve
to
explain
some
popular
ideas
of
the
supernatural
which
western
people
know
very
little
about
and
i
could
help
you
with
the
translation
i
gladly
accepted
the
suggestion
and
we
composed
the
following
summary
of
the
more
extraordinary
portion
of
encho
romance
here
and
there
we
found
it
necessary
to
condense
the
original
narrative
and
we
tried
to
keep
close
to
the
text
only
in
the
conversational
passages
some
of
which
happen
to
possess
a
particular
quality
of
psychological
interest
this
is
the
story
of
the
ghosts
in
the
romance
of
the
lantern
i
there
once
lived
in
the
district
of
ushigome
in
yedo
a
hatamoto
called
iijima
heizayemon
whose
only
daughter
tsuyu
was
beautiful
as
her
name
which
signifies
morning
dew
iijima
took
a
second
wife
when
his
daughter
was
about
sixteen
and
finding
that
could
not
be
happy
with
her
he
had
a
pretty
villa
built
for
the
girl
at
yanagijima
as
a
separate
residence
and
gave
her
an
excellent
maidservant
called
to
wait
upon
her
lived
happily
enough
in
her
new
home
until
one
day
when
the
family
physician
yamamoto
shijo
paid
her
a
visit
in
company
with
a
young
samurai
named
hagiwara
shinzaburo
who
resided
in
the
nedzu
quarter
shinzaburo
was
an
unusually
handsome
lad
and
very
gentle
and
the
two
young
people
fell
in
love
with
each
other
at
sight
even
before
the
brief
visit
was
over
they
contrived
unheard
by
the
old
doctor
to
pledge
themselves
to
each
other
for
life
and
at
parting
whispered
to
the
youth
remember
if
you
do
not
come
to
see
me
again
i
shall
certainly
die
shinzaburo
never
forgot
those
words
and
he
was
only
too
eager
to
see
more
of
but
etiquette
forbade
him
to
make
the
visit
alone
he
was
obliged
to
wait
for
some
other
chance
to
accompany
the
doctor
who
had
promised
to
take
him
to
the
villa
a
second
time
unfortunately
the
old
man
did
not
keep
this
promise
he
had
perceived
the
sudden
affection
of
and
he
feared
that
her
father
would
hold
him
responsible
for
any
serious
results
iijima
heizayemon
had
a
reputation
for
cutting
off
heads
and
the
more
shijo
thought
about
the
possible
consequences
of
his
introduction
of
shinzaburo
at
the
iijima
villa
the
more
he
became
afraid
therefore
he
purposely
abstained
from
calling
upon
his
young
friend
months
passed
and
little
imagining
the
true
cause
of
shinzaburo
neglect
believed
that
her
love
had
been
scorned
then
she
pined
away
and
died
soon
afterwards
the
faithful
servant
also
died
through
grief
at
the
loss
of
her
mistress
and
the
two
were
buried
side
by
side
in
the
cemetery
of
a
temple
which
still
stands
in
the
neighborhood
of
where
the
famous
are
yearly
held
the
hatamoto
were
samurai
forming
the
special
military
force
of
the
shogun
the
name
literally
signifies
these
were
the
highest
class
of
samurai
not
only
as
the
immediate
vassals
of
the
shogun
but
as
a
military
aristocracy
ii
shinzaburo
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
but
his
disappointment
and
his
anxiety
had
resulted
in
a
prolonged
illness
he
was
slowly
recovering
but
still
very
weak
when
he
unexpectedly
received
another
visit
from
yamamoto
shijo
the
old
man
made
a
number
of
plausible
excuses
for
his
apparent
neglect
shinzaburo
said
to
him
i
have
been
sick
ever
since
the
beginning
of
spring
even
now
i
can
not
eat
anything
was
it
not
rather
unkind
of
you
never
to
call
i
thought
that
we
were
to
make
another
visit
together
to
the
house
of
the
lady
iijima
and
i
wanted
to
take
to
her
some
little
present
as
a
return
for
our
kind
reception
of
course
i
could
not
go
by
myself
shijo
gravely
responded
i
am
very
sorry
to
tell
you
that
the
young
lady
is
dead
dead
repeated
shinzaburo
turning
white
did
you
say
that
she
is
dead
the
doctor
remained
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
collecting
himself
then
he
resumed
in
the
quick
light
tone
of
a
man
resolved
not
to
take
trouble
seriously
my
great
mistake
was
in
having
introduced
you
to
her
for
it
seems
that
she
fell
in
love
with
you
at
once
i
am
afraid
that
you
must
have
said
something
to
encourage
this
affection
when
you
were
in
that
little
room
together
at
all
events
i
saw
how
she
felt
towards
you
and
then
i
became
uneasy
fearing
that
her
father
might
come
to
hear
of
the
matter
and
lay
the
whole
blame
upon
me
so
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
decided
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
call
upon
you
and
i
purposely
stayed
away
for
a
long
time
but
only
a
few
days
ago
happening
to
visit
house
i
heard
to
my
great
surprise
that
his
daughter
had
died
and
that
her
servant
had
also
died
then
remembering
all
that
had
taken
place
i
knew
that
the
young
lady
must
have
died
of
love
for
you
laughing
ah
you
are
really
a
sinful
fellow
yes
you
are
laughing
is
it
a
sin
to
have
been
born
so
handsome
that
the
girls
die
for
love
of
you
seriously
well
we
must
leave
the
dead
to
the
dead
it
is
no
use
to
talk
further
about
the
matter
all
that
you
now
can
do
for
her
is
to
repeat
the
nembutsu
and
the
old
man
retired
hastily
anxious
to
avoid
further
converse
about
the
painful
event
for
which
he
felt
himself
to
have
been
unwittingly
responsible
perhaps
this
conversation
may
seem
strange
to
the
western
reader
but
it
is
true
to
life
the
whole
of
the
scene
is
characteristically
japanese
the
invocation
namu
amida
butsu
hail
to
the
buddha
amitabha
repeated
as
a
prayer
for
the
sake
of
the
dead
iii
shinzaburo
long
remained
stupefied
with
grief
by
the
news
of
tsuyu
death
but
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
again
able
to
think
clearly
he
inscribed
the
dead
girl
name
upon
a
mortuary
tablet
and
placed
the
tablet
in
the
buddhist
shrine
of
his
house
and
set
offerings
before
it
and
recited
prayers
every
day
thereafter
he
presented
offerings
and
repeated
the
nembutsu
and
the
memory
of
was
never
absent
from
his
thought
nothing
occurred
to
change
the
monotony
of
his
solitude
before
the
time
of
the
bon
the
great
festival
of
the
dead
which
begins
upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
seventh
month
then
he
decorated
his
house
and
prepared
everything
for
the
festival
hanging
out
the
lanterns
that
guide
the
returning
spirits
and
setting
the
food
of
ghosts
on
the
shoryodana
or
shelf
of
souls
and
on
the
first
evening
of
the
ban
after
he
kindled
a
small
lamp
before
the
tablet
of
and
lighted
the
lanterns
the
night
was
clear
with
a
great
moon
and
windless
and
very
warm
shinzaburo
sought
the
coolness
of
his
veranda
clad
only
in
a
light
he
sat
there
thinking
dreaming
sorrowing
sometimes
fanning
himself
sometimes
making
a
little
smoke
to
drive
the
mosquitoes
away
everything
was
quiet
it
was
a
lonesome
neighborhood
and
there
were
few
he
could
hear
only
the
soft
rushing
of
a
neighboring
stream
and
the
shrilling
of
but
all
at
once
this
stillness
was
broken
by
a
sound
of
geta
approaching
and
the
sound
drew
nearer
and
nearer
quickly
till
it
reached
the
surrounding
the
garden
then
shinzaburö
feeling
curious
stood
on
tiptoe
so
as
to
look
over
the
hedge
and
he
saw
two
women
passing
one
who
was
carrying
a
beautiful
lantern
decorated
with
appeared
to
be
a
servant
the
other
was
a
slender
girl
of
about
seventeen
wearing
a
robe
embroidered
with
designs
of
almost
at
the
same
instant
both
women
turned
their
faces
toward
shinzaburo
and
to
his
utter
astonishment
he
recognized
and
her
servant
yone
they
stopped
immediately
and
the
girl
cried
out
oh
how
strange
hagiwara
sama
shinzaburo
simultaneously
called
to
the
maid
ah
you
are
i
remember
you
very
well
hagiwara
sama
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
supreme
amazement
never
could
i
have
believed
it
possible
sir
we
were
told
that
you
had
died
how
extraordinary
cried
shinzaburo
why
i
was
told
that
both
of
you
were
dead
ah
what
a
hateful
story
returned
why
repeat
such
unlucky
words
who
told
you
please
to
come
in
said
shinzaburo
here
we
can
talk
better
the
is
open
so
they
entered
and
exchanged
greeting
and
when
shinzaburo
had
made
them
comfortable
he
said
i
trust
that
you
will
pardon
my
discourtesy
in
not
having
called
upon
you
for
so
long
a
time
but
shijo
the
doctor
about
a
month
ago
told
me
that
you
had
both
died
so
it
was
he
who
told
you
exclaimed
it
was
very
wicked
of
him
to
say
such
a
thing
well
it
was
also
shijo
who
told
us
that
you
were
dead
i
think
that
he
wanted
to
deceive
you
which
was
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
because
you
are
so
confiding
and
trustful
possibly
my
mistress
betrayed
her
liking
for
you
in
some
words
which
found
their
way
to
her
father
ears
and
in
that
case
the
new
wife
might
have
planned
to
make
the
doctor
tell
you
that
we
were
dead
so
as
to
bring
about
a
separation
anyhow
when
my
mistress
heard
that
you
had
died
she
wanted
to
cut
off
her
hair
immediately
and
to
become
a
nun
but
i
was
able
to
prevent
her
from
cutting
off
her
hair
and
i
persuaded
her
at
last
to
become
a
nun
only
in
her
heart
afterwards
her
father
wished
her
to
marry
a
certain
young
man
and
she
refused
then
there
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
chiefly
caused
by
and
we
went
away
from
the
villa
and
found
a
very
small
house
in
there
we
are
now
just
barely
able
to
live
by
doing
a
little
private
work
my
mistress
has
been
constantly
repeating
the
nembutsu
for
your
sake
being
the
first
day
of
the
bon
we
went
to
visit
the
temples
and
we
were
on
our
way
home
thus
late
when
this
strange
meeting
happened
oh
how
extraordinary
cried
shinzaburo
can
it
be
true
is
it
only
a
dream
here
i
too
have
been
constantly
reciting
the
nembutsu
before
a
tablet
with
her
name
upon
it
look
and
he
showed
them
tablet
in
its
place
upon
the
shelf
of
souls
we
are
more
than
grateful
for
your
kind
remembrance
returned
smiling
now
as
for
my
mistress
she
continued
turning
towards
who
had
all
the
while
remained
demure
and
silent
her
face
with
her
sleeve
as
for
my
mistress
she
actually
says
that
she
would
not
mind
being
disowned
by
her
father
for
the
time
of
seven
existences
or
even
being
killed
by
him
for
your
sake
come
will
you
not
allow
her
to
stay
here
shinzaburo
turned
pale
for
joy
he
answered
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
please
remain
but
do
not
speak
loud
because
there
is
a
troublesome
fellow
living
close
by
a
ninsomi
called
hakuodo
yusai
who
tells
peoples
fortunes
by
looking
at
their
faces
he
is
inclined
to
be
curious
and
it
is
better
that
he
should
not
know
the
two
women
remained
that
night
in
the
house
of
the
young
samurai
and
returned
to
their
own
home
a
little
before
daybreak
and
after
that
night
they
came
every
nighht
for
seven
nights
whether
the
weather
were
foul
or
fair
always
at
the
same
hour
and
shinzaburo
became
more
and
more
attached
to
the
girl
and
the
twain
were
fettered
each
to
each
by
that
bond
of
illusion
which
is
stronger
than
bands
of
iron
komageta
in
the
original
the
geta
is
a
wooden
sandal
or
clog
of
which
there
are
many
varieties
some
decidedly
elegant
the
komageta
or
is
because
of
the
sonorous
echo
which
it
makes
on
hard
ground
the
sort
of
lantern
here
referred
to
is
no
longer
made
and
its
shape
can
best
be
understood
by
a
glance
at
the
picture
accompanying
this
story
it
was
totally
unlike
the
modern
domestic
painted
with
the
owner
crest
but
it
was
not
altogether
unlike
some
forms
of
lanterns
still
manufactured
for
the
festival
of
the
dead
and
called
the
flowers
ornamenting
it
were
not
painted
they
were
artificial
flowers
of
and
were
attached
to
the
top
of
the
lantern
for
the
time
of
seven
existences
that
is
to
say
for
the
time
of
seven
successive
lives
in
japanese
drama
and
romance
it
is
not
uncommon
to
represent
a
father
as
disowning
his
child
for
the
time
of
seven
lives
such
a
disowning
is
called
made
no
mando
a
disinheritance
for
seven
lives
signifying
that
in
six
future
lives
after
the
present
the
erring
son
or
daughter
will
continue
to
feel
the
parental
displeasure
the
profession
is
not
yet
extinct
the
ninsomi
uses
a
kind
of
magnifying
glass
or
sometimes
called
tengankyo
or
ninsomegane
iv
now
there
was
a
man
called
tomozo
who
lived
in
a
small
cottage
adjoining
shinzaburo
residence
tomozo
and
his
wife
were
both
employed
by
shinzaburo
as
servants
both
seemed
to
be
devoted
to
their
young
master
and
by
his
help
they
were
able
to
live
in
comparative
comfort
one
night
at
a
very
late
hour
tomozo
heard
the
voice
of
a
woman
in
his
master
apartment
and
this
made
him
uneasy
he
feared
that
shinzaburo
being
very
gentle
and
affectionate
might
be
made
the
dupe
of
some
cunning
wanton
in
which
event
the
domestics
would
be
the
first
to
suffer
he
therefore
resolved
to
watch
and
on
the
following
night
he
stole
on
tiptoe
to
shinzaburo
dwelling
and
looked
through
a
chink
in
one
of
the
sliding
shutters
by
the
glow
of
a
within
the
he
was
able
to
perceive
that
his
master
and
a
strange
woman
were
talking
together
under
the
at
first
he
could
not
see
the
woman
distinctly
her
back
was
turned
to
him
he
only
observed
that
she
was
very
slim
and
that
she
appeared
to
be
very
young
judging
from
the
fashion
of
her
dress
and
hair
putting
his
ear
to
the
chink
he
could
hear
the
conversation
plainly
the
woman
said
and
if
i
should
be
disowned
by
my
father
would
you
then
let
me
come
and
live
with
you
shinzaburo
answered
most
assuredly
i
would
nay
i
should
be
glad
of
the
chance
but
there
is
no
reason
to
fear
that
you
will
ever
be
disowned
by
your
father
for
you
are
his
only
daughter
and
he
loves
you
very
much
what
i
do
fear
is
that
some
day
we
shall
be
cruelly
separated
she
responded
softly
never
never
could
i
even
think
of
accepting
any
other
man
for
my
husband
even
if
our
secret
were
to
become
known
and
my
father
were
to
kill
me
for
what
i
have
done
still
after
death
itself
i
could
never
cease
to
think
of
you
and
i
am
now
quite
sure
that
you
yourself
would
not
be
able
to
live
very
long
without
then
clinging
closely
to
him
with
her
lips
at
his
neck
she
caressed
him
and
he
returned
her
caresses
tomozo
wondered
as
he
listened
because
the
language
of
the
woman
was
not
the
language
of
a
common
woman
but
the
language
of
a
lady
of
rank
then
he
determined
at
all
hazards
to
get
one
glimpse
of
her
face
and
he
crept
round
the
house
backwards
and
forwards
peering
through
every
crack
and
chink
and
at
last
he
was
able
to
see
but
therewith
an
icy
trembling
seized
him
and
the
hair
of
his
head
stood
up
for
the
face
was
the
face
of
a
woman
long
dead
and
the
fingers
caressing
were
fingers
of
naked
bone
and
of
the
body
below
the
waist
there
was
not
anything
it
melted
off
into
thinnest
trailing
shadow
where
the
eyes
of
the
lover
deluded
saw
youth
and
grace
and
beauty
there
appeared
to
the
eyes
of
the
watcher
horror
only
and
the
emptiness
of
death
simultaneously
another
woman
figure
and
a
weirder
rose
up
from
within
the
chamber
and
swiftly
made
toward
the
watcher
as
if
discerning
his
presence
then
in
uttermost
terror
he
fled
to
the
dwelling
of
hakuodo
yusai
and
knocking
frantically
at
the
doors
succeeded
in
arousing
him
the
color
and
form
of
the
dress
and
the
style
of
wearing
the
hair
are
by
japanese
custom
regulated
to
the
age
of
the
woman
the
forms
of
speech
used
by
the
samurai
and
other
superior
classes
differed
considerably
from
those
of
the
popular
idiom
but
these
differences
could
not
be
effectively
rendered
into
english
v
hakuodo
yusai
the
ninsomi
was
a
very
old
man
but
in
his
time
he
had
travelled
much
and
he
had
heard
and
seen
so
many
things
that
he
could
not
be
easily
surprised
yet
the
story
of
the
terrified
tomozo
both
alarmed
and
amazed
him
he
had
read
in
ancient
chinese
books
of
love
between
the
living
and
the
dead
but
he
had
never
believed
it
possible
now
however
he
felt
convinced
that
the
statement
of
tomozo
was
not
a
falsehood
and
that
something
very
strange
was
really
going
on
in
the
house
of
hagiwara
should
the
truth
prove
to
be
what
tomozo
imagined
then
the
young
samurai
was
a
doomed
man
if
the
woman
be
a
ghost
said
yusai
to
the
frightened
servant
if
the
woman
be
a
ghost
your
master
must
die
very
soon
unless
something
extraordinary
can
be
done
to
save
him
and
if
the
woman
be
a
ghost
the
signs
of
death
will
appear
upon
his
face
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
is
yoki
and
pure
the
spirit
of
the
dead
is
inki
and
unclean
the
one
is
positive
the
other
negative
he
whose
bride
is
a
ghost
can
not
live
even
though
in
his
blood
there
existed
the
force
of
a
life
of
one
hundred
years
that
force
must
quickly
perish
still
i
shall
do
all
that
i
can
to
save
hagiwara
sama
and
in
the
meantime
tomozo
say
nothing
to
any
other
person
not
even
to
your
wife
about
this
matter
at
sunrise
i
shall
call
upon
your
master
when
questioned
next
morning
by
yusai
shinzaburo
at
first
attempted
to
deny
that
any
women
had
been
visiting
the
house
but
finding
this
artless
policy
of
no
avail
and
perceiving
that
the
old
man
purpose
was
altogether
unselfish
he
was
finally
persuaded
to
acknowledge
what
had
really
occurred
and
to
give
his
reasons
for
wishing
to
keep
the
matter
a
secret
as
for
the
lady
iijima
he
intended
he
said
to
make
her
his
wife
as
soon
as
possible
oh
madness
cried
yusai
losing
all
patience
in
the
intensity
of
his
alarm
know
sir
that
the
people
who
have
been
coming
here
night
after
night
are
dead
some
frightful
delusion
is
upon
you
why
the
simple
fact
that
you
long
supposed
to
be
dead
and
repeated
the
nembutsu
for
her
and
made
offerings
before
her
tablet
is
itself
the
proof
the
lips
of
the
dead
have
touched
you
the
hands
of
the
dead
have
caressed
you
even
at
this
moment
i
see
in
your
face
the
signs
of
death
and
you
will
not
believe
listen
to
me
now
sir
i
beg
of
you
if
you
wish
to
save
yourself
otherwise
you
have
less
than
twenty
days
to
live
they
told
you
those
people
that
they
were
residing
in
the
district
of
shitaya
in
did
you
ever
visit
them
at
that
place
no
of
course
you
did
not
then
go
as
soon
as
you
can
to
and
try
to
find
their
home
and
having
uttered
this
counsel
with
the
most
vehement
earnestness
hakuodo
yusai
abruptly
took
his
departure
shinzaburo
startled
though
not
convinced
resolved
after
a
moment
reflection
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
ninsomi
and
to
go
to
shitaya
it
was
yet
early
in
the
morning
when
he
reached
the
quarter
of
and
began
his
search
for
the
dwelling
of
he
went
through
every
street
and
street
read
all
the
names
inscribed
at
the
various
entrances
and
made
inquiries
whenever
an
opportunity
presented
itself
but
he
could
not
find
anything
resembling
the
little
house
mentioned
by
and
none
of
the
people
whom
he
questioned
knew
of
any
house
in
the
quarter
inhabited
by
two
single
women
feeling
at
last
certain
that
further
research
would
be
useless
he
turned
homeward
by
the
shortest
way
which
happened
to
lead
through
the
grounds
of
the
temple
suddenly
his
attention
was
attracted
by
two
new
tombs
placed
side
by
side
at
the
rear
of
the
temple
one
was
a
common
tomb
such
as
might
have
been
erected
for
a
person
of
humble
rank
the
other
was
a
large
and
handsome
monument
and
hanging
before
it
was
a
beautiful
which
had
probably
been
left
there
at
the
time
of
the
festival
of
the
dead
shinzaburo
remembered
that
the
carried
by
was
exactly
similar
and
the
coincidence
impressed
him
as
strange
he
looked
again
at
the
tombs
but
the
tombs
explained
nothing
neither
bore
any
personal
name
only
the
buddhist
kaimyo
or
posthumous
appellation
then
he
determined
to
seek
information
at
the
temple
an
acolyte
stated
in
reply
to
his
questions
that
the
large
tomb
had
been
recently
erected
for
the
daughter
of
iijima
heizayemon
the
hatamoto
of
ushigome
and
that
the
small
tomb
next
to
it
was
that
of
her
servant
who
had
died
of
grief
soon
after
the
young
lady
funeral
immediately
to
shinzaburö
memory
there
recurred
with
another
and
sinister
meaning
the
words
of
we
went
away
and
found
a
very
small
house
in
there
we
are
now
just
barely
able
to
live
by
doing
a
little
private
work
here
was
indeed
the
very
small
house
and
in
but
the
little
private
work
the
samurai
hastened
with
all
speed
to
the
house
of
yusai
and
begged
for
his
counsel
and
assistance
but
yusai
declared
himself
unable
to
be
of
any
aid
in
such
a
case
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
send
shinzaburo
to
the
ryoseki
of
with
a
letter
praying
for
immediate
religious
help
vii
the
ryoseki
was
a
learned
and
a
holy
man
by
spiritual
vision
he
was
able
to
know
the
secret
of
any
sorrow
and
the
nature
of
the
karma
that
had
caused
it
he
heard
unmoved
the
story
of
shinzaburo
and
said
to
him
a
very
great
danger
now
threatens
you
because
of
an
error
committed
in
one
of
your
former
states
of
existence
the
karma
that
binds
you
to
the
dead
is
very
strong
but
if
i
tried
to
explain
its
character
you
would
not
be
able
to
understand
i
shall
therefore
tell
you
only
this
that
the
dead
person
has
no
desire
to
injure
you
out
of
hate
feels
no
enmity
towards
you
she
is
influenced
on
the
contrary
by
the
most
passionate
affection
for
you
probably
the
girl
has
been
in
love
with
you
from
a
time
long
preceding
your
present
life
from
a
time
of
not
less
than
three
or
four
past
existences
and
it
would
seem
that
although
necessarily
changing
her
form
and
condition
at
each
succeeding
birth
she
has
not
been
able
to
cease
from
following
after
you
therefore
it
will
not
be
an
easy
thing
to
escape
from
her
influence
but
now
i
am
going
to
lend
you
this
powerful
mamoni
it
is
a
pure
gold
image
of
that
buddha
called
the
sounding
tathagata
because
his
preaching
of
the
law
sounds
through
the
world
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
this
little
image
is
especially
a
which
protects
the
living
from
the
dead
this
you
must
wear
in
its
covering
next
to
your
body
under
the
girdle
besides
i
shall
presently
perform
in
the
temple
a
for
the
repose
of
the
troubled
spirit
and
here
is
a
holy
sutra
called
kyo
or
sutra
you
must
be
careful
to
recite
it
every
night
in
your
house
without
fail
furthermore
i
shall
give
you
this
package
of
you
must
paste
one
of
them
over
every
opening
of
your
house
no
matter
how
small
if
you
do
this
the
power
of
the
holy
texts
will
prevent
the
dead
from
entering
but
whatever
may
happen
do
not
fail
to
recite
the
sutra
shinzaburo
humbly
thanked
the
and
then
taking
with
him
the
image
the
sutra
and
the
bundle
of
sacred
texts
he
made
all
haste
to
reach
his
home
before
the
hour
of
sunset
the
japanese
word
mamori
has
significations
at
least
as
numerous
as
those
attaching
to
our
own
term
amulet
it
would
be
impossible
in
a
mere
footnote
even
to
suggest
the
variety
of
japanese
religious
objects
to
which
the
name
is
given
in
this
instance
the
mamori
is
a
very
small
image
probably
enclosed
in
a
miniature
shrine
of
or
metal
over
which
a
silk
cover
is
drawn
such
little
images
were
often
worn
by
samurai
on
the
person
i
was
recently
shown
a
miniature
figure
of
kwannon
in
an
iron
case
which
had
been
carried
by
an
officer
through
the
satsuma
war
he
observed
with
good
reason
that
it
had
probably
saved
his
life
for
it
had
stopped
a
bullet
of
which
the
dent
was
plainly
visible
from
shiryo
a
ghost
and
yokeru
to
exclude
the
japanese
have
two
kinds
of
ghosts
proper
in
their
the
spirits
of
the
dead
shiryo
and
the
spirits
of
the
living
ikiryo
a
house
or
a
person
may
be
haunted
by
an
ikiryo
as
well
as
by
a
shiryo
a
special
service
accompanying
offerings
of
food
to
those
dead
having
no
living
relatives
or
friends
to
care
for
them
is
thus
termed
in
this
case
however
the
service
would
be
of
a
particular
and
exceptional
kind
the
name
would
be
more
correctly
written
it
is
the
japanese
pronunciation
of
the
title
of
a
very
short
sutra
translated
out
of
sanscrit
into
chinese
by
the
indian
priest
amoghavajra
probably
during
the
eighth
century
the
chinese
text
contains
transliterations
of
some
mysterious
sanscrit
words
apparently
talismanic
words
like
those
to
be
seen
in
translation
of
the
ch
xxvi
is
the
general
name
given
to
religious
texts
used
as
charms
or
talismans
they
are
sometimes
stamped
or
burned
upon
wood
but
more
commonly
written
or
printed
upon
narrow
strips
of
paper
are
pasted
above
on
the
walls
of
rooms
upon
tablets
placed
in
household
shrines
etc
some
kinds
are
worn
about
the
person
others
are
made
into
pellets
and
swallowed
as
spiritual
medicine
the
text
of
the
larger
fuda
is
often
accompanied
by
curious
pictures
or
symbolic
illustrations
viii
with
yusai
advice
and
help
shinzaburo
was
able
before
dark
to
fix
the
holy
texts
over
all
the
apertures
of
his
dwelling
then
the
ninsomi
returned
to
his
own
house
leaving
the
youth
alone
night
came
warm
and
clear
shinzaburo
made
fast
the
doors
bound
the
precious
amulet
about
his
waist
entered
his
and
by
the
glow
of
a
began
to
recite
the
for
a
long
time
he
chanted
the
words
comprehending
little
of
their
meaning
then
he
tried
to
obtain
some
rest
but
his
mind
was
still
too
much
disturbed
by
the
strange
events
of
the
day
midnight
passed
and
no
sleep
came
to
him
at
last
he
heard
the
boom
of
the
great
of
announcing
the
eighth
hour
it
ceased
and
shinzaburo
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
geta
approaching
from
the
old
direction
but
this
time
more
slowly
at
once
a
cold
sweat
broke
over
his
forehead
opening
the
sutra
hastily
with
trembling
hand
he
began
again
to
recite
it
aloud
the
steps
came
nearer
and
nearer
reached
the
live
hedge
stopped
then
strange
to
say
shinzaburo
felt
unable
to
remain
under
his
something
stronger
even
than
his
fear
impelled
him
to
look
and
instead
of
continuing
to
recite
the
he
foolishly
approached
the
shutters
and
through
a
chink
peered
out
into
the
night
before
the
house
he
saw
standing
and
with
the
and
both
of
them
were
gazing
at
the
buddhist
texts
pasted
above
the
entrance
never
before
not
even
in
what
time
she
lived
had
appeared
so
beautiful
and
shinzaburo
felt
his
heart
drawn
towards
her
with
a
power
almost
resistless
but
the
terror
of
death
and
the
terror
of
the
unknown
restrained
and
there
went
on
within
him
such
a
struggle
between
his
love
and
his
fear
that
he
became
as
one
suffering
in
the
body
the
pains
of
the
hell
presently
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
saying
my
dear
mistress
there
is
no
way
to
enter
the
heart
of
hagiwara
sama
must
have
changed
for
the
promise
that
he
made
last
night
has
been
broken
and
the
doors
have
been
made
fast
to
keep
us
out
we
can
not
go
in
it
will
be
wiser
for
you
to
make
up
your
mind
not
to
think
any
more
about
him
because
his
feeling
towards
you
has
certainly
changed
it
is
evident
that
he
does
not
want
to
see
you
so
it
will
be
better
not
to
give
yourself
any
more
trouble
for
the
sake
of
a
man
whose
heart
is
so
unkind
but
the
girl
answered
weeping
oh
to
think
that
this
could
happen
after
the
pledges
which
we
made
to
each
other
often
i
was
told
that
the
heart
of
a
man
changes
as
quickly
as
the
sky
of
autumn
yet
surely
the
heart
of
hagiwara
sama
can
not
be
so
cruel
that
he
should
really
intend
to
exclude
me
in
this
way
dear
yone
please
find
some
means
of
taking
me
to
him
unless
you
do
i
will
never
never
go
home
again
thus
she
continued
to
plead
veiling
her
face
with
her
long
sleeves
and
very
beautiful
she
looked
and
very
touching
but
the
fear
of
death
was
strong
upon
her
lover
at
last
made
answer
my
dear
young
lady
why
will
you
trouble
your
mind
about
a
man
who
seems
to
be
so
cruel
well
let
us
see
if
there
be
no
way
to
enter
at
the
back
of
the
house
come
with
me
and
taking
by
the
hand
she
led
her
away
toward
the
rear
of
the
dwelling
and
there
the
two
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
the
light
disappears
when
the
flame
of
a
lamp
is
blown
out
according
to
the
old
japanese
way
of
counting
time
this
yatsudoki
or
eighth
hour
was
the
same
as
our
two
in
the
morning
each
japanese
hour
was
equal
to
two
european
hours
so
that
there
were
only
six
hours
instead
of
our
twelve
and
these
six
hours
were
counted
backwards
in
the
order
thus
the
ninth
hour
corresponded
to
our
midday
or
midnight
nine
to
our
one
eight
to
our
two
two
in
the
morning
also
called
the
hour
of
the
ox
was
the
japanese
hour
of
ghosts
and
goblins
or
sanscrit
tapana
is
the
sixth
of
the
eight
hot
hells
of
japanese
buddhism
one
day
of
life
in
this
hell
is
equal
in
duration
to
thousands
some
say
millions
of
human
years
ix
night
after
night
the
shadows
came
at
the
hour
of
the
ox
and
nightly
shinzaburo
heard
the
weeping
of
yet
he
believed
himself
saved
little
imagining
that
his
doom
had
already
been
decided
by
the
character
of
his
dependents
tomozo
had
promised
yusai
never
to
speak
to
any
other
person
not
even
to
of
the
strange
events
that
were
taking
place
but
tomozo
was
not
long
suffered
by
the
haunters
to
rest
in
peace
night
after
night
entered
into
his
dwelling
and
roused
him
from
his
sleep
and
asked
him
to
remove
the
placed
over
one
very
small
window
at
the
back
of
his
master
house
and
tomozo
out
of
fear
as
often
promised
her
to
take
away
the
fuda
before
the
next
sundown
but
never
by
day
could
he
make
up
his
mind
to
remove
it
believing
that
evil
was
intended
to
shinzaburo
at
last
in
a
night
of
storm
startled
him
from
slumber
with
a
cry
of
reproach
and
stooped
above
his
pillow
and
said
to
him
have
a
care
how
you
trifle
with
us
if
by
night
you
do
not
take
away
that
text
you
shall
learn
how
i
can
hate
and
she
made
her
face
so
frightful
as
she
spoke
that
tomozo
nearly
died
of
terror
the
wife
of
tomozo
had
never
till
then
known
of
these
visits
even
to
her
husband
they
had
seemed
like
bad
dreams
but
on
this
particular
night
it
chanced
that
waking
suddenly
she
heard
the
voice
of
a
woman
talking
to
tomozo
almost
in
the
same
moment
the
ceased
and
when
looked
about
her
she
saw
by
the
light
of
the
only
her
husband
shuddering
and
white
with
fear
the
stranger
was
gone
the
doors
were
fast
it
seemed
impossible
that
anybody
could
have
entered
nevertheless
the
jealousy
of
the
wife
had
been
aroused
and
she
began
to
chide
and
to
question
tomozo
in
such
a
manner
that
he
thought
himself
obliged
to
betray
the
secret
and
to
explain
the
terrible
dilemma
in
which
he
had
been
placed
then
the
passion
of
yielded
to
wonder
and
alarm
but
she
was
a
subtle
woman
and
she
devised
immediately
a
plan
to
save
her
husband
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
master
and
she
gave
tomozo
a
cunning
counsel
telling
him
to
make
conditions
with
the
dead
they
came
again
on
the
following
night
at
the
hour
of
the
ox
and
hid
herself
on
hearing
the
sound
of
their
coming
koron
but
tomozo
went
out
to
meet
them
in
the
dark
and
even
found
courage
to
say
to
them
what
his
wife
had
told
him
to
say
it
is
true
that
i
deserve
your
blame
but
i
had
no
wish
to
cause
you
anger
the
reason
that
the
has
not
been
taken
away
is
that
my
wife
and
i
are
able
to
live
only
by
the
help
of
hagiwara
sama
and
that
we
can
not
expose
him
to
any
danger
without
bringing
misfortune
upon
ourselves
but
if
we
could
obtain
the
sum
of
a
hundred
ryo
in
gold
we
should
be
able
to
please
you
because
we
should
then
need
no
help
from
anybody
therefore
if
you
will
give
us
a
hundred
ryo
i
can
take
the
fuda
away
without
being
afraid
of
losing
our
only
means
of
support
when
he
had
uttered
these
words
and
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
said
mistress
i
told
you
that
it
was
not
right
to
trouble
this
man
as
we
have
no
just
cause
of
ill
will
against
him
but
it
is
certainly
useless
to
fret
yourself
about
hagiwara
sama
because
his
heart
has
changed
towards
you
now
once
again
my
dear
young
lady
let
me
beg
you
not
to
think
any
more
about
him
but
weeping
made
answer
dear
yone
whatever
may
happen
i
can
not
possibly
keep
myself
from
thinking
about
him
you
know
that
you
can
get
a
hundred
ryo
to
have
the
taken
off
only
once
more
i
pray
dear
yone
only
once
more
bring
me
face
to
face
with
hagiwara
sama
i
beseech
you
and
hiding
her
face
with
her
sleeve
she
thus
continued
to
plead
oh
why
will
you
ask
me
to
do
these
things
responded
you
know
very
well
that
i
have
no
money
but
since
you
will
persist
in
this
whim
of
yours
in
spite
of
all
that
i
can
say
i
suppose
that
i
must
try
to
find
the
money
somehow
and
to
bring
it
here
night
then
turning
to
the
faithless
tomozo
she
said
tomozo
i
must
tell
you
that
hagiwara
sama
now
wears
upon
his
body
a
mamoni
called
by
the
name
of
nyorai
and
that
so
long
as
he
wears
it
we
can
not
approach
him
so
you
will
have
to
get
that
mamori
away
from
him
by
some
means
or
other
as
well
as
to
remove
the
tomozo
feebly
made
answer
that
also
i
can
do
if
you
will
promise
to
bring
me
the
hundred
ryo
well
mistress
said
you
will
wait
will
you
not
until
night
oh
dear
yone
sobbed
the
other
have
we
to
go
back
again
without
seeing
hagiwara
sama
ah
it
is
cruel
and
the
shadow
of
the
mistress
weeping
was
led
away
by
the
shadow
of
the
maid
x
another
day
went
and
another
night
came
and
the
dead
came
with
it
but
this
time
no
lamentation
was
heard
without
the
house
of
hagiwara
for
the
faithless
servant
found
his
reward
at
the
hour
of
the
ox
and
removed
the
moreover
he
had
been
able
while
his
master
was
at
the
bath
to
steal
from
its
case
the
golden
mamori
and
to
substitute
for
it
an
image
of
copper
and
he
had
buried
the
in
a
desolate
field
so
the
visitants
found
nothing
to
oppose
their
entering
veiling
their
faces
with
their
sleeves
they
rose
and
passed
like
a
streaming
of
vapor
into
the
little
window
from
over
which
the
holy
text
had
been
torn
away
but
what
happened
thereafter
within
the
house
tomozo
never
knew
the
sun
was
high
before
he
ventured
again
to
approach
his
master
dwelling
and
to
knock
upon
the
for
the
first
time
in
years
he
obtained
no
response
and
the
silence
made
him
afraid
repeatedly
he
called
and
received
no
answer
then
aided
by
he
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance
and
making
his
way
alone
to
the
where
he
called
again
in
vain
he
rolled
back
the
rumbling
shutters
to
admit
the
light
but
still
within
the
house
there
was
no
stir
at
last
he
dared
to
lift
a
corner
of
the
but
no
sooner
had
he
looked
beneath
than
he
fled
from
the
house
with
a
cry
of
horror
shinzaburo
was
dead
hideously
dead
and
his
face
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
had
died
in
the
uttermost
agony
of
fear
and
lying
beside
him
in
the
bed
were
the
bones
of
a
woman
and
the
bones
of
the
arms
and
the
bones
of
the
hands
clung
fast
about
his
neck
xl
hakuodo
yusai
the
went
to
view
the
corpse
at
the
prayer
of
the
faithless
tomozo
the
old
man
was
terrified
and
astonished
at
the
spectacle
but
looked
about
him
with
a
keen
eye
he
soon
perceived
that
the
had
been
taken
from
the
little
window
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
on
searching
the
body
of
shinzaburo
he
discovered
that
the
golden
mamori
had
been
taken
from
its
wrapping
and
a
copper
image
of
fudo
put
in
place
of
it
he
suspected
tomozo
of
the
theft
but
the
whole
occurrence
was
so
very
extraordinary
that
he
thought
it
prudent
to
consult
with
the
priest
ryoseki
before
taking
further
action
therefore
after
having
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
premises
he
betook
himself
to
the
temple
as
quickly
as
his
aged
limbs
could
bear
him
ryoseki
without
waiting
to
hear
the
purpose
of
the
old
visit
at
once
invited
him
into
a
private
apartment
you
know
that
you
are
always
welcome
here
said
ryoseki
please
seat
yourself
at
ease
well
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
hagiwara
sama
is
dead
yusai
wonderingly
exclaimed
yes
he
is
dead
but
how
did
you
learn
of
it
the
priest
responded
hagiwara
sama
was
suffering
from
the
results
of
an
evil
karma
and
his
attendant
was
a
bad
man
what
happened
to
hagiwara
sama
was
unavoidable
his
destiny
had
been
determined
from
a
time
long
before
his
last
birth
it
will
be
better
for
you
not
to
let
your
mind
be
troubled
by
this
event
yusai
said
i
have
heard
that
a
priest
of
pure
life
may
gain
power
to
see
into
the
future
for
a
hundred
years
but
truly
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
existence
that
i
have
had
proof
of
such
power
still
there
is
another
matter
about
which
i
am
very
anxious
you
mean
interrupted
ryoseki
the
stealing
of
the
holy
mamori
the
but
you
must
not
give
yourself
any
concern
about
that
the
image
has
been
buried
in
a
field
and
it
will
be
found
there
and
returned
to
me
during
the
eighth
month
of
the
coming
year
so
please
do
not
be
anxious
about
it
more
and
more
amazed
the
old
ninsomi
ventured
to
observe
i
have
studied
the
and
the
science
of
divination
and
i
make
my
living
by
telling
peoples
fortunes
but
i
can
not
possibly
understand
how
you
know
these
things
ryoseki
answered
gravely
never
mind
how
i
happen
to
know
them
i
now
want
to
speak
to
you
about
hagiwara
funeral
the
house
of
hagiwara
has
its
own
of
course
but
to
bury
him
there
would
not
be
proper
he
must
be
buried
beside
the
lady
iijima
for
his
to
her
was
a
very
deep
one
and
it
is
but
right
that
you
should
erect
a
tomb
for
him
at
your
own
cost
because
you
have
been
indebted
to
him
for
many
favors
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
shinzaburo
was
buried
beside
in
the
cemetery
of
in
here
ends
the
story
of
the
ghosts
in
the
romance
of
the
the
male
and
female
principles
of
the
universe
the
active
and
passive
forces
of
nature
yusai
refers
here
to
the
old
chinese
better
known
to
western
readers
by
the
name
my
friend
asked
me
whether
the
story
had
interested
me
and
i
answered
by
telling
him
that
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
cemetery
of
so
as
to
realize
more
definitely
the
local
color
of
the
author
studies
i
shall
go
with
you
at
once
he
said
but
what
did
you
think
of
the
personages
to
western
thinking
i
made
answer
shinzaburo
is
a
despicable
creature
i
have
been
mentally
comparing
him
with
the
true
lovers
of
our
old
they
were
only
too
glad
to
follow
a
dead
sweetheart
into
the
grave
and
nevertheless
being
christians
they
believed
that
they
had
only
one
human
life
to
enjoy
in
this
world
but
shinzaburo
was
a
buddhist
with
a
million
lives
behind
him
and
a
million
lives
before
him
and
he
was
too
selfish
to
give
up
even
one
miserable
existence
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
that
came
back
to
him
from
the
dead
then
he
was
even
more
cowardly
than
selfish
although
a
samurai
by
birth
and
training
he
had
to
beg
a
priest
to
save
him
from
ghosts
in
every
way
he
proved
himself
contemptible
and
did
quite
right
in
choking
him
to
death
from
the
japanese
point
of
view
likewise
my
friend
responded
shinzaburo
is
rather
contemptible
but
the
use
of
this
weak
character
helped
the
author
to
develop
incidents
that
could
not
otherwise
perhaps
have
been
so
effectively
managed
to
my
thinking
the
only
attractive
character
in
the
story
is
that
of
type
of
the
loyal
and
loving
servant
intelligent
shrewd
full
of
resource
faithful
not
only
unto
death
but
beyond
death
well
let
us
go
to
we
found
the
temple
uninteresting
and
the
cemetery
an
abomination
of
desolation
spaces
once
occupied
by
graves
had
been
turned
into
between
were
tombs
leaning
at
all
angles
out
of
the
perpendicular
tablets
made
illegible
by
scurf
empty
pedestals
shattered
and
statues
of
buddhas
without
heads
or
hands
recent
rains
had
soaked
the
black
soil
leaving
here
and
there
small
pools
of
slime
about
which
swarms
of
tiny
frogs
were
hopping
everything
excepting
the
seemed
to
have
been
neglected
for
years
in
a
shed
just
within
the
gate
we
observed
a
woman
cooking
and
my
companion
presumed
to
ask
her
if
she
knew
anything
about
the
tombs
described
in
the
romance
of
the
ah
the
tombs
of
and
she
responded
smiling
you
will
find
them
near
the
end
of
the
first
row
at
the
back
of
the
temple
next
to
the
statue
of
jizo
surprises
of
this
kind
i
had
met
with
elsewhere
in
japan
we
picked
our
way
between
the
and
between
the
green
ridges
of
young
potatoes
whose
roots
were
doubtless
feeding
on
the
of
many
another
and
and
we
reached
at
last
two
tombs
of
which
the
inscriptions
seemed
almost
obliterated
beside
the
larger
tomb
was
a
statue
of
jizo
with
a
broken
nose
the
characters
are
not
easy
to
make
out
said
my
friend
but
wait
he
drew
from
his
sleeve
a
sheet
of
soft
white
paper
laid
it
over
the
inscription
and
began
to
rub
the
paper
with
a
lump
of
clay
as
he
did
so
the
characters
appeared
in
white
on
the
blackened
surface
eleventh
day
third
month
rat
elder
brother
fire
sixth
year
of
horeki
d
this
would
seem
to
be
the
grave
of
some
innkeeper
of
nedzu
named
kichibei
let
us
see
what
is
on
the
other
monument
with
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
he
presently
brought
out
the
text
of
a
kaimyo
and
read
illustrious
inhabiting
the
the
grave
of
some
buddhist
nun
what
utter
humbug
i
exclaimed
that
woman
was
only
making
fun
of
us
now
my
friend
protested
you
are
unjust
to
the
woman
you
came
here
because
you
wanted
a
sensation
and
she
tried
her
very
best
to
please
you
you
did
not
suppose
that
was
true
did
you
footprints
of
the
buddha
i
i
was
recently
surprised
to
find
in
anderson
catalogue
of
japanese
and
chinese
paintings
in
the
british
museum
this
remarkable
statement
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
japan
the
figure
of
the
buddha
is
never
represented
by
the
feet
or
pedestal
alone
as
in
the
amravati
remains
and
many
other
indian
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
representation
is
not
even
rare
in
japan
it
is
to
be
found
not
only
upon
stone
monuments
but
also
in
religious
paintings
especially
certain
kakemono
suspended
in
temples
these
kakemono
usually
display
the
footprints
upon
a
very
large
scale
with
a
multitude
of
mystical
symbols
and
characters
the
sculptures
may
be
less
common
but
in
tokyo
alone
there
are
a
number
of
or
foot
stones
which
i
have
seen
and
probably
several
which
i
have
not
seen
there
is
one
at
the
temple
of
near
one
at
the
temple
of
in
koishikawa
one
at
the
temple
of
in
asakusa
and
a
beautiful
example
at
zojoji
in
shiba
these
are
not
cut
out
of
a
single
block
but
are
composed
of
fragments
cemented
into
the
irregular
traditional
shape
and
capped
with
a
heavy
slab
of
nebukawa
granite
on
the
polished
surface
of
which
the
design
is
engraved
in
lines
about
of
an
inch
in
depth
i
should
judge
the
average
height
of
these
pedestals
to
be
about
two
feet
four
inches
and
their
greatest
diameter
about
three
feet
around
the
footprints
there
are
carved
in
most
of
the
examples
twelve
little
bunches
of
leaves
and
buds
of
the
bodhidruma
or
of
buddhist
legend
in
all
cases
the
footprint
design
is
about
the
same
but
the
monuments
are
different
in
quality
and
finish
that
of
zojoji
with
figures
of
divinities
cut
in
low
relief
on
its
sides
is
the
most
ornate
and
costly
of
the
four
the
specimen
at
is
very
poor
and
plain
the
first
made
in
japan
was
that
erected
at
todaiji
in
nara
it
was
designed
after
a
similar
monument
in
china
said
to
be
the
faithful
copy
of
an
indian
original
concerning
this
indian
original
the
following
tradition
is
given
in
an
old
buddhist
book
in
a
temple
of
the
province
of
makada
maghada
there
is
a
great
stone
the
buddha
once
trod
upon
this
stone
and
the
prints
of
the
soles
of
his
feet
remain
upon
its
surface
the
length
of
the
impressions
is
one
foot
and
eight
inches
and
the
width
of
them
a
little
more
than
six
inches
on
the
of
each
footprint
there
is
the
impression
of
a
wheel
and
upon
each
of
the
prints
of
the
ten
toes
there
is
a
design
which
sometimes
radiates
light
when
the
buddha
felt
that
the
time
of
his
nirvana
was
approaching
he
went
to
kushina
kusinara
and
there
stood
upon
that
stone
he
stood
with
his
face
to
the
south
then
he
said
to
his
disciple
anan
ananda
this
place
i
leave
the
impression
of
my
feet
to
remain
for
a
last
token
although
a
king
of
this
country
will
try
to
destroy
the
impression
it
can
never
be
entirely
destroyed
and
indeed
it
has
not
been
destroyed
unto
this
day
once
a
king
who
hated
buddhism
caused
the
top
of
the
stone
to
be
pared
off
so
as
to
remove
the
impression
but
after
the
surface
had
been
removed
the
footprints
reappeared
upon
the
stone
concerning
the
virtue
of
the
representation
of
the
footprints
of
the
buddha
there
is
sometimes
quoted
a
text
from
the
thus
translated
for
me
in
that
time
shaka
sakyamuni
lifted
up
his
foot
when
the
buddha
lifted
up
his
foot
all
could
perceive
upon
the
sole
of
it
the
appearance
of
a
wheel
of
a
thousand
spokes
and
shaka
said
beholds
the
sign
upon
the
sole
of
my
foot
shall
be
purified
from
all
his
faults
even
he
who
beholds
the
sign
after
my
death
shall
be
delivered
from
all
the
evil
results
of
all
his
errors
various
other
texts
of
japanese
buddhism
affirm
that
whoever
looks
upon
the
footprints
of
the
buddha
shall
be
freed
from
the
bonds
of
error
and
conducted
upon
the
way
of
enlightenment
an
outline
of
the
footprints
as
engraved
on
one
of
the
japanese
pedestals
should
have
some
interest
even
for
persons
familiar
with
indian
sculptures
of
the
the
drawing
accompanying
this
paper
and
showing
both
footprints
has
been
made
after
the
tracing
at
where
the
footprints
have
the
full
legendary
dimension
it
will
be
observed
that
there
are
only
seven
emblems
these
are
called
in
japan
the
or
seven
appearances
i
got
some
information
about
them
from
the
a
book
used
by
the
jodo
sect
this
book
also
contains
rough
woodcuts
of
the
footprints
and
one
of
them
i
reproduce
here
for
the
purpose
of
calling
attention
to
the
curious
form
of
the
emblems
upon
the
toes
they
are
said
to
be
modifications
of
the
manji
or
svastika
but
i
doubt
it
in
the
the
corresponding
figures
suggest
the
design
mentioned
in
the
tradition
of
the
maghada
stone
while
the
symbols
in
the
suggest
fire
indeed
their
outline
so
much
resembles
the
conventional
of
buddhist
decoration
that
i
can
not
help
thinking
them
originally
intended
to
indicate
the
traditional
luminosity
of
the
footprints
moreover
there
is
a
text
in
the
book
called
shidai
that
lends
support
to
this
supposition
the
sole
of
the
foot
of
the
buddha
is
flat
like
the
base
of
a
upon
it
are
lines
forming
the
appearance
of
a
wheel
of
a
thousand
spokes
the
toes
are
slender
round
long
straight
graceful
and
somewhat
luminous
fig
the
explanation
of
the
seven
appearances
which
is
given
by
the
can
not
be
called
satisfactory
but
it
is
not
without
interest
in
relation
to
japanese
popular
buddhism
the
emblems
are
considered
in
the
following
order
the
svastika
the
figure
upon
each
toe
is
said
to
be
a
modification
of
the
manji
and
although
i
doubt
whether
this
is
always
the
case
i
have
observed
that
on
some
of
the
large
kakemono
representing
the
footprints
the
emblem
really
is
the
svastika
not
a
flamelet
nor
a
the
japanese
commentator
explains
the
svastika
as
a
symbol
of
everlasting
bliss
the
fish
gyo
the
fish
signifies
freedom
from
all
restraints
as
in
the
water
a
fish
moves
easily
in
any
direction
so
in
the
the
knows
no
restraints
or
obstructions
the
jap
sansc
vadjra
explained
as
signifying
the
divine
force
that
strikes
and
breaks
all
the
lusts
bonno
of
the
world
the
jap
hora
or
trumpet
emblem
of
the
preaching
of
the
law
the
book
calls
it
the
symbol
of
the
voice
of
the
buddha
the
calls
it
the
token
of
the
preaching

of
the

doctrine

at

of

the

are
filled
with
delight

mystical
word

rendered

intelligence
triumphant
over
birth
and

the

this
emblem
called
in

is
curiously
explained
by
various
quotations
the
says
the
effect
of
a
wheel
is
to
crush
something
and
the
effect
of
the
preaching
is
to
crush
all
delusions
errors
doubts
and
superstitions
therefore
preaching
the
doctrine
is
called
the
the
says
even
as
the
common
wheel
has
its
spokes
and
its
hub
so
in
buddhism
there
are
many
branches
of
the

of
the
buddha
supremacy
above
the
gods

i
think
that
the
inscriptions
upon
any
of

will
be
found
of
more
significance
than
the
above
imperfect
attempts
at
an
explanation
of
the
emblems
the
inscriptions
upon
the
monument
at
are
typical
on
different
sides
of
the
structure
near
the
top
and
placed
by
rule
so
as
to
face
certain
points
of
the
compass
there
are
engraved
five
sanscrit
characters
which
are
symbols
of
the
five
elemental
buddhas
together
with
scriptural
and
commemorative
texts
these
latter
have
been
translated
for
me
as
follows
the
says
in
that
time
from
beneath
his
feet
the
buddha
radiated
a
light
having
the
appearance
of
a
wheel
of
a
thousand
spokes
and
all
who
saw
that
radiance
became
strictly
upright
and
obtained
the
supreme
enlightenment
the
says
whosoever
looks
upon
the
footprints
of
the
buddha
shall
be
freed
from
the
results
even
of
innumerable
thousands
of
imperfections
the
says
in
the
land
that
the
buddha
treads
in
journeying
there
is
not
even
one
person
in
all
the
multitude
of
the
villages
who
is
not
benefited
then
throughout
the
world
there
is
peace
and
good

out

solitary
meditation
upon
the
pain
and
the
mystery
of
being
the
mind
of
an
indian
pilgrim
brought
forth
the
highest
truth
ever
taught
to
men
and
in
an
era
barren
of
science
anticipated
the
uttermost
knowledge
of
our
present
evolutional
philosophy
regarding
the
secret
unity
of
life
the
endless
illusions
of
matter
and
of
mind
and
the
birth
and
death
of
universes
he
by
pure
reason
and
he
alone
before
our
time
found
answers
of
worth
to
the
questions
of
the
whence
the
whither
and
the
why
and
he
made
with
these
answers
another
and
a
nobler
faith
than
the
creed
of
his
fathers
he
spoke
and
returned
to
his
dust
and
the
people
worshipped
the
prints
of
his
dead
feet
because
of
the
love
that
he
had
taught
them
thereafter
waxed
and
waned
the
name
of
alexander
and
the
power
of
rome
and
the
might
of
islam
nations
arose
and
vanished
cities
grew
and
were
not
the
children
of
another
civilization
vaster
than
romes
begirdled
the
earth
with
conquest
and
founded
empires
and
came
at
last
to
rule
in
the
land
of
that
pilgrim
birth
and
these
rich
in
the
wisdom
of
four
and
twenty
centuries
wondered
at
the
beauty
of
his
message
and
caused
all
that
he
had
said
and
done
to
be
written
down
anew
in
languages
unborn
at
the
time
when
he
lived
and

marvelling
follows
their
gleam

seek
the
supreme
enlightenment
even
thus
of
old
milinda
the
king
followed
the
way
to
the
house
of
nagasena
at
first
only
to
question
after
the
subtle
method
of
the
greeks
yet
later
to
accept
with
noble
reverence
the
nobler
method
of
the
master
ululation
she
is
lean
as
a
wolf
and
very
old
the
white
bitch
that
guards
my
gate
at
night
she
played
with
most
of
the
young
men
and
women
of
the
neighborhood
when
they
were
boys
and
girls
i
found
her
in
charge
of
my
present
dwelling
on
the
day
that
i
came
to
occupy
it
she
had
guarded
the
place
i
was
told
for
a
long
succession
of
prior
tenants
apparently
with
no
better
reason
than
that
she
had
been
born
in
the
woodshed
at
the
back
of
the
house
whether
well
or
ill
treated
she
had
served
all
occupants
faultlessly
as
a
watch
the
question
of
food
as
wages
had
never
seriously
troubled
her
because
most
of
the
families
of
the
street
daily
contributed
to
her
support
she
is
gentle
and
silent
silent
at
least
by
day
and
in
spite
of
her
gaunt
ugliness
her
pointed
ears
and
her
somewhat
unpleasant
eyes
everybody
is
fond
of
her
children
ride
on
her
back
and
tease
her
at
will
but
although
she
has
been
known
to
make
strange
men
feel
uncomfortable
she
never
growls
at
a
child
the
reward
of
her
patient
is
the
friendship
of
the
community
when
the
come
on
their
round
the
neighbors
look
after
her
interests
once
she
was
on
the
very
point
of
being
officially
executed
when
the
wife
of
the
smith
ran
to
the
rescue
and
pleaded
successfully
with
the
policeman
superintending
the
massacres
put
somebody
name
on
the
dog
said
the
latter
then
it
will
be
safe
whose
dog
is
it
that
question
proved
hard
to
answer
the
dog
was
everybody
and
nobody
welcome
everywhere
but
owned
nowhere
but
where
does
it
stay
asked
the
puzzled
constable
it
stays
said
the
smith
wife
in
the
house
of
the
foreigner
then
let
the
foreigner
name
be
put
upon
the
dog
suggested
the
policeman
accordingly
i
had
my
name
painted
on
her
back
in
big
japanese
characters
but
the
neighbors
did
not
think
that
she
was
sufficiently
safeguarded
by
a
single
name
so
the
priest
of
kobudera
painted
the
name
of
the
temple
on
her
left
side
in
beautiful
chinese
text
and
the
smith
put
the
name
of
his
shop
on
her
right
side
and
the
put
on
her
breast
the
ideographs
for
which
represent
the
customary
abbreviation
of
the
word
yaoya
any
yaoya
being
supposed
to
sell
eight
hundred
or
more
different
things
consequently
she
is
now
a
very
dog
but
she
is
well
protected
by
all
that
calligraphy
i
have
only
one
fault
to
find
with
her
she
howls
at
night
howling
is
one
of
the
few
pathetic
pleasures
of
her
existence
at
first
i
tried
to
frighten
her
out
of
the
habit
but
finding
that
she
refused
to
take
me
seriously
i
concluded
to
let
her
howl
it
would
have
been
monstrous
to
beat
her
yet
i
detest
her
howl
it
always
gives
me
a
feeling
of
vague
disquiet
like
the
uneasiness
that
precedes
the
horror
of
nightmare
it
makes
me
afraid
indefinably
superstitiously
afraid
perhaps
what
i
am
writing
will
seem
to
you
absurd
but
you
would
not
think
it
absurd
if
you
once
heard
her
howl
she
does
not
howl
like
the
common
she
belongs
to
some
ruder
northern
breed
much
more
wolfish
and
retaining
wild
traits
of
a
very
peculiar
kind
and
her
howl
is
also
peculiar
it
is
incomparably
weirder
than
the
howl
of
any
european
dog
and
i
fancy
that
it
is
incomparably
older
it
may
represent
the
original
primitive
cry
of
her
species
totally
unmodified
by
centuries
of
domestication
it
begins
with
a
stifled
moan
like
the
moan
of
a
bad
dream
mounts
into
a
long
long
wail
like
a
wailing
of
wind
sinks
quavering
into
a
chuckle
rises
again
to
a
wail
very
much
higher
and
wilder
than
before
breaks
suddenly
into
a
kind
of
atrocious
laughter
and
finally
sobs
itself
out
in
a
plaint
like
the
crying
of
a
little
child
the
ghastliness
of
the
performance
is
chiefly
though
not
entirely
in
the
goblin
mockery
of
the
laughing
tones
as
contrasted
with
the
piteous
agony
of
the
wailing
ones
an
incongruity
that
makes
you
think
of
madness
and
i
imagine
a
corresponding
incongruity
in
the
soul
of
the
creature
i
know
that
she
loves
me
that
she
would
throw
away
her
poor
life
for
me
at
an
instant
notice
i
am
sure
that
she
would
grieve
if
i
were
to
die
but
she
would
not
think
about
the
matter
like
other
dogs
like
a
dog
with
hanging
ears
for
ample
she
is
too
savagely
close
to
nature
for
that
were
she
to
find
herself
alone
with
my
corpse
in
some
desolate
place
she
would
first
mourn
wildly
for
her
friend
but
this
duty
formed
she
would
proceed
to
ease
her
sorrow
in
the
simplest
way
possible
by
eating
him
by
cracking
his
bones
between
those
long
of
hers
and
thereafter
with
spotless
conscience
she
would
sit
down
and
utter
to
the
moon
the
funeral
cry
of
her
ancestors
it
fills
me
that
cry
with
a
strange
curiosity
not
less
than
with
a
strange
horror
because
of
certain
extraordinary
vowellings
in
it
which
always
recur
in
the
same
order
of
sequence
and
must
represent
particular
forms
of
animal
speech
particular
ideas
the
whole
thing
is
a
song
a
song
of
emotions
and
thoughts
not
human
and
therefore
humanly
unimaginable
but
other
dogs
know
what
it
means
and
make
answer
over
the
miles
of
the
night
sometimes
from
so
far
away
that
only
by
straining
my
hearing
to
the
uttermost
can
i
detect
the
faint
response
the
words
if
i
may
call
them
words
are
very
few
yet
to
judge
by
their
emotional
effect
they
must
signify
a
great
deal
possibly
they
mean
things
myriads
of
years
old
things
relating
to
odors
to
exhalations
to
influences
and
effluences
inapprehensible
by
duller
human
sense
impulses
also
impulses
without
name
bestirred
in
ghosts
of
dogs
by
the
light
of
great
moons
could
we
know
the
sensations
of
a
dog
the
emotions
and
the
ideas
of
a
dog
we
might
discover
some
strange
correspondence
between
their
character
and
the
character
of
that
peculiar
disquiet
which
the
howl
of
the
creature
evokes
but
since
the
senses
of
a
dog
are
totally
unlike
those
of
a
man
we
shall
never
really
know
and
we
can
only
surmise
in
the
vaguest
way
the
meaning
of
the
uneasiness
in
ourselves
some
notes
in
the
long
cry
and
the
weirdest
of
them
oddly
resemble
those
tones
of
the
human
voice
that
tell
of
agony
and
terror
again
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
sound
of
the
cry
itself
became
associated
in
human
imagination
at
some
period
enormously
remote
with
particular
impressions
of
fear
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
in
almost
all
countries
including
japan
the
howling
of
dogs
has
been
attributed
to
their
perception
of
things
viewless
to
man
and
awful
especially
gods
and
ghosts
and
this
unanimity
of
superstitious
belief
suggests
that
one
element
of
the
disquiet
inspired
by
the
cry
is
the
dread
of
the
supernatural
we
have
ceased
to
be
consciously
afraid
of
the
unseen
knowing
that
we
ourselves
are
supernatural
that
even
the
physical
man
with
all
his
life
of
sense
is
more
ghostly
than
any
ghost
of
old
imagining
but
some
dim
inheritance
of
the
primitive
fear
still
slumbers
in
our
being
and
wakens
perhaps
like
an
echo
to
the
sound
of
that
wail
in
the
night
whatever
thing
invisible
to
human
eyes
the
senses
of
a
dog
may
at
times
perceive
it
can
be
nothing
resembling
our
idea
of
a
ghost
most
probably
the
mysterious
cause
of
start
and
whine
is
not
anything
there
is
no
anatomical
reason
for
supposing
a
dog
to
possess
exceptional
powers
of
vision
but
a
dog
organs
of
scent
proclaim
a
faculty
immeasurably
superior
to
the
sense
of
smell
in
man
the
old
universal
belief
in
the
superhuman
perceptivities
of
the
creature
was
a
belief
justified
by
fact
but
the
perceptivities
are
not
visual
were
the
howl
of
a
dog
really
as
once
supposed
an
outcry
of
ghostly
terror
the
meaning
might
possibly
be
i
smell
them
but
not
i
see
them
no
evidence
exists
to
support
the
fancy
that
a
dog
can
see
any
forms
of
being
which
a
man
can
not
see
but
the
of
the
white
creature
in
my
close
forces
me
to
wonder
whether
she
does
not
see
something
really
terrible
something
which
we
vainly
try
to
keep
out
of
moral
consciousness
the
ghoulish
law
of
life
nay
there
are
times
when
her
cry
seems
to
me
not
the
mere
cry
of
a
dog
but
the
voice
of
the
law
itself
the
very
speech
of
that
nature
so
inexplicably
called
by
poets
the
loving
the
merciful
the
divine
divine
perhaps
in
some
unknowable
ultimate
way
but
certainly
not
merciful
and
still
more
certainly
not
loving
only
by
eating
each
other
do
beings
exist
beautiful
to
the
vision
our
world
may
seem
with
its
loves
its
hopes
its
memories
its
aspirations
but
there
is
nothing
beautiful
in
the
fact
that
life
is
fed
by
continual
murder
that
the
tenderest
affection
the
noblest
enthusiasm
the
purest
idealism
must
be
nourished
by
the
eating
of
flesh
and
the
drinking
of
blood
all
life
to
sustain
itself
must
devour
life
you
may
imagine
yourself
divine
if
you
please
but
you
have
to
obey
that
law
be
if
you
will
a
vegetarian
none
the
less
you
must
eat
forms
that
have
feeling
and
desire
sterilize
your
food
and
digestion
stops
you
can
not
even
drink
without
swallowing
life
loathe
the
name
as
we
may
we
are
cannibals
all
being
essentially
is
one
and
whether
we
eat
the
flesh
of
a
plant
a
fish
a
reptile
a
bird
a
mammal
or
a
man
the
ultimate
fact
is
the
same
and
for
all
life
the
end
is
the
same
every
creature
whether
buried
or
burnt
is
devoured
and
not
only
once
or
twice
nor
a
hundred
nor
a
thousand
nor
a
myriad
times
consider
the
ground
upon
which
we
move
the
soil
out
of
which
we
came
think
of
the
vanished
billions
that
have
risen
from
it
and
crumbled
back
into
its
latency
to
feed
what
becomes
our
food
perpetually
we
eat
the
dust
of
our
race
substance
of
our
ancient
but
even
inanimate
matter
is
substance
preys
upon
substance
as
in
the
droplet
monad
swallows
monad
so
in
the
vast
of
space
do
spheres
consume
each
other
stars
give
being
to
worlds
and
devour
them
planets
assimilate
their
own
moons
all
is
a
ravening
that
never
ends
but
to
recommence
and
unto
whomsoever
thinks
about
these
matters
the
story
of
a
divine
universe
made
and
ruled
by
paternal
love
sounds
less
persuasive
than
the
polynesian
tale
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
devoured
by
the
gods
monstrous
the
law
seems
because
we
have
developed
ideas
and
sentiments
which
are
opposed
to
this
demoniac
nature
much
as
voluntary
movement
is
opposed
to
the
blind
power
of
gravitation
but
the
possession
of
such
ideas
and
sentiments
does
but
aggravate
the
atrocity
of
our
situation
without
lessening
in
the
least
the
gloom
of
the
final
problem
anyhow
the
faith
of
the
far
east
meets
that
problem
better
than
the
faith
of
the
west
to
the
buddhist
the
cosmos
is
not
divine
at
all
quite
the
reverse
it
is
karma
it
is
the
creation
of
thoughts
and
acts
of
error
it
is
not
governed
by
any
providence
it
is
a
ghastliness
a
nightmare
likewise
it
is
an
illusion
it
seems
real
only
for
the
same
reason
that
the
shapes
and
the
pains
of
an
evil
dream
seem
real
to
the
dreamer
our
life
upon
earth
is
a
state
of
sleep
yet
we
do
not
sleep
utterly
there
are
gleams
in
our
darkness
faint
auroral
wakenings
of
love
and
pity
and
sympathy
and
magnanimity
these
are
selfless
and
true
these
are
eternal
and
divine
these
are
the
four
infinite
feelings
in
whose
all
forms
and
illusions
will
vanish
like
mists
in
the
light
of
the
sun
but
except
in
so
far
as
we
wake
to
these
feelings
we
are
dreamers
indeed
moaning
unaided
in
darkness
tortured
by
shadowy
horror
all
of
us
dream
none
are
fully
awake
and
many
who
pass
for
the
wise
of
the
world
know
even
less
of
the
truth
than
my
dog
that
howls
in
the
night
could
she
speak
my
dog
i
think
that
she
might
ask
questions
which
no
philosopher
would
be
able
to
answer
for
i
believe
that
she
is
tormented
by
the
pain
of
existence
of
course
i
do
not
mean
that
the
riddle
presents
itself
to
her
as
it
does
to
us
nor
that
she
can
have
reached
any
abstract
conclusions
by
any
mental
processes
like
our
own
the
external
world
to
her
is
a
continuum
of
smells
she
thinks
compares
remembers
reasons
by
smells
by
smell
she
makes
her
estimates
of
character
all
her
judgments
are
founded
upon
smells
smelling
thousands
of
things
which
we
can
not
smell
at
all
she
must
comprehend
them
in
a
way
of
which
we
can
form
no
idea
whatever
she
knows
has
been
learned
through
mental
operations
of
an
utterly
unimaginable
kind
but
we
may
be
tolerably
sure
that
she
thinks
about
most
things
in
some
to
the
experience
of
eating
or
to
the
intuitive
dread
of
being
eaten
certainly
she
knows
a
great
deal
more
about
the
earth
on
which
we
tread
than
would
be
good
for
us
to
know
and
probably
if
capable
of
speech
she
could
tell
us
the
strangest
stories
of
air
and
water
gifted
or
afflicted
as
she
is
with
such
terribly
penetrant
power
of
sense
her
notion
of
apparent
realities
must
be
worse
than
sepulchral
small
wonder
if
she
howl
at
the
moon
that
shines
upon
such
a
world
and
yet
she
is
more
awake
in
the
buddhist
meaning
than
many
of
us
she
possesses
a
rude
moral
code
inculcating
loyalty
submission
gentleness
gratitude
and
maternal
love
together
with
various
minor
rules
of
conduct
and
this
simple
code
she
has
always
observed
by
priests
her
state
is
termed
a
state
of
darkness
of
mind
because
she
can
not
learn
all
that
men
should
learn
but
according
to
her
light
she
has
done
well
enough
to
merit
some
better
condition
in
her
next
rebirth
so
think
the
people
who
know
her
when
she
dies
they
will
give
her
an
humble
funeral
and
have
a
sutra
recited
on
behalf
of
her
spirit
the
priest
will
let
a
grave
be
made
for
her
somewhere
in
the
garden
and
will
place
over
it
a
little
sotoba
bearing
the
text
chikusho
hotsu
even
within
such
as
this
animal
the
knowledge
supreme
will
unfold
at
last
the
that
is
to
say
the
supreme
enlightenment
the
intelligence
of
buddhahood
itself
bits
of
poetry
i
among
a
people
with
whom
poetry
has
been
for
centuries
a
universal
fashion
of
emotional
utterance
we
should
naturally
suppose
the
common
ideal
of
life
to
be
a
noble
one
however
poorly
the
upper
classes
of
such
a
people
might
compare
with
those
of
other
nations
we
could
scarcely
doubt
that
its
lower
classes
were
morally
and
otherwise
in
advance
of
our
own
lower
classes
and
the
japanese
actually
present
us
with
such
a
social
phenomenon
poetry
in
japan
is
universal
as
the
air
it
is
felt
by
everybody
it
is
read
by
everybody
it
is
composed
by
almost
everybody
irrespective
of
class
and
condition
nor
is
it
thus
ubiquitous
in
the
mental
atmosphere
only
it
is
everywhere
to
be
heard
by
the
ear
and
by
the
as
for
audible
poetry
wherever
there
is
working
there
is
singing
the
toil
of
the
fields
and
the
labor
of
the
streets
are
performed
to
the
rhythm
of
chanted
verse
and
song
would
seem
to
be
an
expression
of
the
life
of
the
people
in
about
the
same
sense
that
it
is
an
expression
of
the
life
of
cicadae
as
for
visible
poetry
it
appears
everywhere
written
or
graven
in
chinese
or
in
japanese
characters
as
a
form
of
decoration
in
thousands
and
thousands
of
dwellings
you
might
observe
that
the
screens
separating
rooms
or
closing
alcoves
have
chinese
or
japanese
decorative
texts
upon
them
and
these
texts
are
poems
in
houses
of
the
better
class
there
are
usually
a
number
of
gaku
or
suspended
tablets
to
be
seen
each
bearing
for
all
design
a
beautifully
written
verse
but
poems
can
be
found
upon
almost
any
kind
of
domestic
utensil
for
example
upon
braziers
iron
kettles
vases
wooden
trays
lacquer
ware
porcelains
chopsticks
of
the
finer
sort
even
toothpicks
poems
are
painted
upon
panels
screens
and
fans
poems
are
printed
upon
towels
draperies
curtains
kerchiefs
linings
and
women
underwear
poems
are
stamped
or
worked
upon
envelopes
purses
poems
are
inlaid
upon
enamelled
ware
cut
upon
bronzes
graven
upon
metal
pipes
embroidered
upon
pouches
it
were
a
hopeless
effort
to
enumerate
a
tithe
of
the
articles
decorated
with
poetical
texts
probably
my
readers
know
of
those
social
gatherings
at
which
it
is
the
custom
to
compose
verses
and
to
suspend
the
compositions
to
blossoming
frees
also
of
the
tanabata
festival
in
honor
of
certain
astral
gods
when
poems
inscribed
on
strips
of
colored
paper
and
attached
to
thin
bamboos
are
to
be
seen
even
by
the
roadside
all
fluttering
in
the
wind
like
so
many
tiny
flags
perhaps
you
might
find
your
way
to
some
japanese
hamlet
in
which
there
are
neither
trees
nor
flowers
but
never
to
any
hamlet
in
which
there
is
no
visible
poetry
you
might
wander
as
i
have
done
into
a
settlement
so
poor
that
you
could
not
obtain
there
for
love
or
money
even
a
cup
of
real
tea
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
could
discover
a
settlement
in
which
there
is
nobody
capable
of
making
a
poem
ii
recently
while
looking
over
a
of
verses
mostly
short
poems
of
an
emotional
or
descriptive
character
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
selection
from
them
might
serve
to
illustrate
certain
japanese
qualities
of
sentiment
as
well
as
some
japanese
theories
of
artistic
expression
and
i
ventured
forthwith
upon
this
essay
the
poems
which
had
been
collected
for
me
by
different
persons
at
many
different
times
and
places
were
chiefly
of
the
kind
written
on
particular
occasions
and
cast
into
forms
more
serried
if
not
also
actually
briefer
than
anything
in
western
prosody
probably
few
of
my
readers
are
aware
of
two
curious
facts
relating
to
this
order
of
composition
both
facts
are
exemplified
in
the
history
and
in
the
texts
of
my
collection
though
i
can
not
hope
in
my
renderings
to
reproduce
the
original
effect
whether
of
imagery
or
of
feeling
the
first
curious
fact
is
that
from
very
ancient
times
the
writing
of
short
poems
has
been
practised
in
japan
even
more
as
a
moral
duty
than
as
a
mere
literary
art
the
old
ethical
teaching
was
somewhat
like
this
are
you
very
angry
do
not
say
anything
unkind
but
compose
a
poem
is
your
dead
do
not
yield
to
useless
grief
but
try
to
calm
your
mind
by
making
a
poem
are
you
troubled
because
you
are
about
to
die
leaving
so
many
things
unfinished
be
brave
and
write
a
poem
on
death
whatever
injustice
or
misfortune
disturbs
you
put
aside
your
resentment
or
your
sorrow
as
soon
as
possible
and
write
a
few
lines
of
sober
and
elegant
verse
for
a
moral
exercise
accordingly
in
the
old
days
every
form
of
trouble
was
encountered
with
a
poem
bereavement
separation
disaster
called
forth
verses
in
lieu
of
plaints
the
lady
who
preferred
death
to
loss
of
honor
composed
a
poem
before
piercing
her
throat
the
samurai
sentenced
to
die
by
his
own
hand
wrote
a
poem
before
performing
even
in
this
less
romantic
era
of
meiji
young
people
resolved
upon
suicide
are
wont
to
compose
some
verses
before
quitting
the
world
also
it
is
still
the
good
custom
to
write
a
poem
in
time
of
i
have
frequently
known
poems
to
be
written
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
of
misery
or
suffering
nay
even
upon
a
bed
of
death
if
the
verses
did
not
display
any
extraordinary
talent
they
at
least
afforded
extraordinary
proof
of
under
pain
surely
this
fact
of
composition
as
ethical
practice
has
larger
interest
than
all
the
treatises
ever
written
about
the
rules
of
japanese
prosody
the
other
curious
fact
is
only
a
fact
of
aesthetic
theory
the
common
of
the
class
of
poems
under
present
consideration
is
identical
with
the
common
principle
of
japanese
pictorial
illustration
by
the
use
of
a
few
chosen
words
the
composer
of
a
short
poem
endeavors
to
do
exactly
what
the
painter
endeavors
to
do
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
brush
to
evoke
an
image
or
a
mood
to
revive
a
sensation
or
an
emotion
and
the
accomplishment
of
this
purpose
by
poet
or
by
depends
altogether
upon
capacity
to
suggest
and
only
to
suggest
a
japanese
artist
would
be
condemned
for
attempting
elaboration
of
detail
in
a
sketch
intended
to
recreate
the
memory
of
some
landscape
seen
through
the
blue
haze
of
a
spring
morning
or
under
the
great
blond
light
of
an
autumn
not
only
would
he
be
false
to
the
traditions
of
his
art
he
would
necessarily
defeat
his
own
end
thereby
in
the
same
way
a
poet
would
be
condemned
for
attempting
any
completeness
of
utterance
in
a
very
short
poem
his
object
should
be
only
to
stir
imagination
without
satisfying
it
so
the
term
ittakkiri
meaning
all
gone
or
entirely
vanished
in
the
sense
of
all
told
is
contemptuously
applied
to
verses
in
which
the
has
uttered
his
whole
thought
praise
being
reserved
for
compositions
that
leave
in
the
mind
the
thrilling
of
a
something
unsaid
like
the
single
stroke
of
a
the
perfect
short
poem
should
set
murmuring
and
undulating
in
the
mind
of
the
hearer
many
a
ghostly
aftertone
of
long
duration
iii
but
for
the
same
reason
that
japanese
short
poems
may
be
said
to
resemble
japanese
pictures
a
full
comprehension
of
them
requires
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
life
which
they
reflect
and
this
is
especially
true
of
the
emotional
class
of
such
poems
a
literal
translation
of
which
in
the
majority
of
cases
would
signify
almost
nothing
to
the
western
mind
here
for
example
is
a
little
verse
pathetic
enough
to
japanese
comprehension
chocho
ni
kyonen
shishitaru
tsuma
koishi
translated
this
would
appear
to
mean
only
two
butterflies
last
year
my
dear
wife
died
unless
you
happen
to
know
the
pretty
japanese
symbolism
of
the
butterfly
in
relation
to
happy
marriage
and
the
old
custom
of
sending
with
the
a
large
pair
of
the
verse
might
well
seem
to
be
less
than
commonplace
or
take
this
recent
composition
by
a
university
student
which
has
been
praised
by
good
judges
furusato
ni
fubo
ari
mushi
no
in
my
native
place
the
old
folks
or
my
parents
are
clamor
of
i
must
observe
however
that
the
praise
was
especially
evoked
by
the
use
of
the
term
literally
meaning
voice
after
voice
or
a
crying
of
many
voices
and
the
special
value
of
the
syllables
here
can
be
appreciated
only
by
a
japanese
poet
the
poet
here
is
a
in
unfamiliar
fields
he
listens
to
the
great
autumn
chorus
of
insects
and
the
sound
revives
for
him
the
memory
of
his
home
and
of
his
parents
but
here
is
something
incomparably
more
touching
though
in
literal
translation
probably
more
obscure
than
either
of
the
preceding
specimens
mi
ni
shimiru
kaze
ya
i
shoji
ni
yubi
no
ato
oh
wind
that
work
of
little
fingers
in
the
shoji
what
does
this
mean
it
means
the
sorrowing
of
a
mother
for
her
dead
child
shoji
is
the
name
given
to
those
light
screens
which
in
a
japanese
house
serve
both
as
windows
and
doors
admitting
plenty
of
light
but
concealing
like
frosted
glass
the
interior
from
outer
observation
and
excluding
the
wind
infants
delight
to
break
these
by
poking
their
fingers
through
the
soft
paper
then
the
wind
blows
through
the
holes
in
this
case
the
wind
blows
very
cold
indeed
into
the
mother
very
heart
for
it
comes
through
the
little
holes
that
were
made
by
the
fingers
of
her
dead
child
more
literally
wind
ah
shoji
in
the
traces
of
viz
holes
made
by
fingers
the
impossibility
of
preserving
the
inner
quality
of
such
poems
in
a
literal
rendering
will
now
be
obvious
whatever
i
attempt
in
this
direction
must
of
necessity
be
ittakkiri
for
the
unspoken
has
to
be
expressed
and
what
the
japanese
poet
is
able
to
say
in
seventeen
or
syllables
may
need
in
english
more
than
double
that
number
of
words
but
perhaps
this
fact
will
lend
additional
interest
to
the
following
atoms
of
emotional
expression
a
mother
remembrance
sweet
and
clear
in
the
night
the
voice
of
a
boy
at
study
reading
out
of
a
book
i
also
once
had
a
boy
a
memory
in
spring
she
who
departing
hence
left
to
the
flowers
of
the
blooming
beside
our
eaves
the
charm
of
her
youth
and
beauty
and
maiden
pureness
of
heart
to
quicken
their
flush
and
fragrance
ah
where
does
she
dwell
our
dear
little
vanished
sister
fancies
of
another
faith
i
sought
in
the
place
of
graves
the
tomb
of
my
vanished
friend
from
ancient
cedars
above
there
rippled
a
wild
doves
cry
perhaps
a
freak
of
the
perhaps
a
sign
of
remembrance
this
fall
of
a
single
leaf
on
the
water
i
pour
for
the
dead
i
whispered
a
prayer
at
the
grave
a
butterfly
rose
and
fluttered
thy
spirit
perhaps
dear
friend
in
a
cemetery
at
night
this
light
of
the
moon
that
plays
on
the
water
i
pour
for
the
dead
differs
nothing
at
all
from
the
moonlight
of
other
years
after
long
absence
the
garden
that
once
i
loved
and
even
the
hedge
of
the
garden
all
is
changed
and
strange
the
moonlight
only
is
faithful
the
moon
along
remembers
the
charm
of
the
time
gone
by
moonlight
on
the
sea
o
vapory
moon
of
spring
would
that
one
plunge
into
ocean
could
win
me
renewal
of
life
as
a
part
of
thy
light
on
the
waters
after
farewell
whither
now
should
look
where
is
the
place
of
parting
boundaries
all
have
vanished
nothing
tells
of
direction
only
the
waste
of
sea
under
the
shining
moon
happy
poverty
wafted
into
my
room
the
scent
of
the
flowers
of
the
changes
my
broken
window
into
a
source
of
delight
autumn
fancies
faded
the
clover
now
sere
and
withered
the
grasses
what
dreams
the
matsumushi
in
the
desolate
strangely
sad
i
thought
sounded
the
bell
of
evening
haply
that
tone
proclaimed
the
night
in
which
autumn
dies
viewing
this
i
dream
of
my
native
village
under
the
same
soft
light
and
the
shadows
about

the

are
more
than
pictorial
they
suggest
something
of
emotion
or
sentiment
but
there
are
thousands
of
pictorial
poems
that
do
not
and
these
would
seem
mere
insipidities
to
a
reader

when
you
learn
that

then
your
first
interest
in
decorative
poetry
is
apt
to
wither
away
yet
these
little
texts
have
a
very
real
merit
of
their
own
and
an
intimate
relation
to
japanese
aesthetic
feeling
and
experience
like
the
pictures
upon
screens
and
fans
and
cups
they
give
pleasure
by
recalling
impressions
of
nature
by
reviving
happy
incidents
of
travel
or
pilgrimage
by
evoking
the
memory
of
beautiful
days
and
when
this
plain
fact
is
fully
understood
the
persistent
attachment
of
modern
japanese
poets
notwithstanding
their
university
training
to
the
ancient
poetical
methods
will
be
found
reasonable
enough
i
need
offer
only
a
very
few
specimens
of
the
purely

let
me
conclude
this
gossip
on
poetry
by
citing
from
another
group
of
verses
also
pictorial
in
a
certain
sense
but
chiefly
remarkable
for
ingenuity
two
curiosities
of
impromptu
the
first
is
old
and
is
attributed
to
the
famous
poetess
chiyo
having
been
challenged
to
make
a
poem
of
seventeen
syllables
referring
to
a
square
a
triangle
and
a
circle
she
is
said
to
have
immediately
responded

four
corners

the
square
letting
down
the
net
at
one
corner
converts
the
square
into
a
triangle
and
the
moon
represents
the
circle
the
other
curiosity
is
a
recent
impromptu
effort
to
portray
in
one
verse
of
seventeen
syllables
the
last
degree
of
perhaps
the
brave
misery
of
the
wandering
student
and
i
very
much
doubt
whether
the
effort
could
be
improved
upon

japanese
buddhist
proverbs
as
representing
that
general
quality
of
moral
experience
which
remains
almost
unaffected
by
social
modifications
of
any
sort
the
proverbial
sayings
of
a
people
must
always
possess
a
special
psychological
interest
for
thinkers
in
this
kind
of
folklore
the
oral
and
the
written
literature
of
japan
is
rich
to
a
degree
that
would
require
a
large
book
to
exemplify
to
the
subject
as
a
whole
no
justice
could
be
done
within
the
limits
of
a
single
essay
but
for
certain
classes
of
proverbs
and
proverbial
phrases
something
can
be
done
within
even
a
few
pages
and
sayings
related
to
buddhism
either
by
allusion
or
derivation
form
a
class
which
seems
to
me
particularly
worthy
of
study
accordingly
with
the
help
of
a
japanese
friend
i
have
selected
and
translated
the
following
series
of
examples
choosing
the
more
simple
and
familiar
where
choice
was
possible
and
placing
the
originals
in
alphabetical
order
to
facilitate
reference
of
course
the
selection
is
imperfectly
representative
but
it
will
serve
to
illustrate
certain
effects
of
buddhist
teaching
upon
popular
thought
and
speech
akuji

better

nuns

the
proverb
signifies
that
it
is
better
to
correct
the
heart
to
conquer
all
vain
regrets
and
desires
than
to
become
a
religious
in
common
parlance
the
phrase
to
shave
the
head
means
to
become
a
monk
or
a
nun
au

here
to
the

of

the

that

the

is
used
especially
in
the
retributive
sense
it
usually
signifies
evil
karma
kwaho
being
the
term
used
in
speaking
of
meritorious
karma
and
its
results

an
unfortunate

the
meaning
of

identical
with
that
of

dhammapada
verse
if
a
man
speaks

acts

done

together
and
talked
of
eastern
religions
about
which
he
knew
incomparably
more
than
i
whatever
i
could
tell
him
concerning
local
beliefs
he
would
comment
upon
in
the
most
startling
manner
citing
weird
correspondences
in
some
living
cult
of
india
burmah
or
ceylon
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
turned
the
conversation
into
a
totally
unexpected
direction
i
have
been
thinking
he
said
about
the
constancy
of
the
relative
proportion
of
the
sexes
and
wondering
whether
buddhist
doctrine
furnishes
an
explanation
for
it
seems
to
me
that
under
ordinary
conditions
of
karma
human
rebirth
would
necessarily
proceed
by
a
regular
alternation
do
you
mean
i
asked
that
a
man
would
be
reborn
as
a
woman
and
a
woman
as
a
man
yes
he
replied
because
desire
is
creative
and
the
desire
of
either
sex
is
towards
the
other
and
how
many
men
i
said
would
want
to
be
reborn
as
women
probably
very
few
he
answered
but
the
doctrine
that
desire
is
creative
does
not
imply
that
the
individual
longing
creates
its
own
satisfaction
quite
the
contrary
the
true
teaching
is
that
the
result
of
every
selfish
wish
is
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty
and
that
what
the
wish
creates
must
prove
to
higher
knowledge
at
least
the
folly
of
wishing
there
you
are
right
i
said
but
i
do
not
yet
understand
your
theory
well
he
continued
if
the
physical
conditions
of
human
rebirth
are
all
determined
by
the
karma
of
the
will
relating
to
physical
conditions
then
sex
would
be
determined
by
the
will
in
relation
to
sex
now
the
will
of
either
sex
is
towards
the
other
above
all
things
else
excepting
life
man
desires
woman
and
woman
man
each
individual
moreover
independently
of
any
personal
relation
feels
perpetually
you
say
the
influence
of
some
inborn
feminine
or
masculine
ideal
which
you
call
ghostly
reflex
of
countless
attachments
in
countless
past
lives
and
the
insatiable
desire
represented
by
this
ideal
would
of
itself
suffice
to
create
the
masculine
or
the
feminine
body
of
the
next
existence
but
most
women
i
observed
would
like
to
be
reborn
as
men
and
the
accomplishment
of
that
wish
would
scarcely
be
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty
why
not
he
returned
the
happiness
or
unhappiness
of
the
new
existence
would
not
be
decided
by
sex
alone
it
would
of
necessity
depend
upon
many
conditions
in
combination
your
theory
is
interesting
i
said
but
i
do
not
know
how
far
it
could
be
made
to
accord
with
accepted
doctrine
and
what
of
the
person
able
through
knowledge
and
practice
of
the
higher
law
to
remain
superior
to
all
weaknesses
of
sex
such
a
one
he
replied
would
be
reborn
neither
as
man
nor
as
woman
providing
there
were
no
karma
powerful
enough
to
check
or
to
weaken
the
results
of
the
reborn
in
some
one
of
the
heavens
i
queried
by
the
apparitional
birth
not
necessarily
he
said
such
a
one
might
be
reborn
in
a
world
of
desire
like
this
but
neither
as
man
only
nor
as
woman
only
reborn
then
in
what
form
i
asked
in
that
of
a
perfect
being
he
responded
a
man
or
a
woman
is
scarcely
more
than
because
in
our
present
imperfect
state
either
sex
can
be
evolved
only
at
the
cost
of
the
other
in
the
mental
and
the
physical
composition
of
every
man
there
is
undeveloped
woman
and
in
the
composition
of
every
woman
there
is
undeveloped
man
but
a
being
complete
would
be
both
perfect
man
and
perfect
woman
possessing
the
highest
faculties
of
both
sexes
with
the
weaknesses
of
neither
some
humanity
higher
than
our
own
in
other
worlds
might
be
thus
evolved
but
you
know
i
observed
that
there
are
buddhist
texts
in
the
saddharma
pundarika
for
example
and
in
the
vinayas
which
forbid
those
texts
he
interrupted
refer
to
imperfect
beings
less
than
man
and
less
than
woman
they
could
not
refer
to
the
condition
that
i
have
been
supposing
but
remember
i
am
not
preaching
a
doctrine
i
am
only
hazarding
a
theory
may
i
put
your
theory
some
day
into
print
i
asked
why
yes
he
made
answer
if
you
believe
it
worth
thinking
about
and
long
afterwards
i
wrote
it
down
thus
as
fairly
as
i
was
able
from
memory
the
daimyo
wife
was
dying
and
knew
that
she
was
dying
she
had
not
been
able
to
leave
her
bed
since
the
early
autumn
of
the
tenth
bunsei
it
was
now
the
fourth
month
of
the
twelfth
bunsei
the
year
by
western
counting
and
the
were
blossoming
she
thought
of
the
in
her
garden
and
of
the
gladness
of
spring
she
thought
of
her
children
she
thought
of
her
husband
various
concubines
especially
the
lady
yukiko
nineteen
years
old
my
dear
wife
said
the
daimyo
you
have
suffered
very
much
for
three
long
years
we
have
done
all
that
we
could
to
get
you
well
watching
beside
you
night
and
day
praying
for
you
and
often
fasting
for
your
sake
but
in
spite
of
our
loving
care
and
in
spite
of
the
skill
of
our
best
physicians
it
would
now
seen
that
the
end
of
your
life
is
not
far
off
probably
we
shall
sorrow
more
than
you
will
sorrow
because
of
your
having
to
leave
what
the
buddha
so
truly
termed
of
the
world
i
shall
order
to
be
performed
no
matter
what
the
cost
every
religious
rite
that
can
serve
you
in
regard
to
your
next
rebirth
and
all
of
us
will
pray
without
ceasing
for
you
that
you
may
not
have
to
wander
in
the
black
space
but
nay
quickly
enter
paradise
and
attain
to
he
spoke
with
the
utmost
tenderness
pressing
her
the
while
then
with
eyelids
closed
she
answered
him
in
a
voice
thin
as
the
voice
of
in
insect
i
am
grateful
most
grateful
for
your
kind
words
yes
it
is
true
as
you
say
that
i
have
been
sick
for
three
long
years
and
that
i
have
been
treated
with
all
possible
care
and
affection
why
indeed
should
i
turn
away
from
the
one
true
path
at
the
very
moment
of
my
death
perhaps
to
think
of
worldly
matters
at
such
a
time
is
not
right
but
i
have
one
last
request
to
make
only
one
call
here
to
me
the
lady
yukiko
you
know
that
i
love
her
like
a
sister
i
want
to
speak
to
her
about
the
affairs
of
this
household
yukiko
came
at
the
summons
of
the
lord
and
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
him
knelt
down
beside
the
couch
the
daimyo
wife
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
yukiko
and
spoke
ah
here
is
yukiko
i
am
so
pleased
to
see
you
yukiko
come
a
little
closer
so
that
you
can
hear
me
well
i
am
not
able
to
speak
loud
yukiko
i
am
going
to
die
i
hope
that
you
will
be
faithful
in
all
things
to
our
dear
lord
for
i
want
you
to
take
my
place
when
i
am
gone
i
hope
that
you
will
always
be
loved
by
him
yes
even
a
hundred
times
more
than
i
have
been
and
that
you
will
very
soon
be
promoted
to
a
higher
rank
and
become
his
honored
wife
and
i
beg
of
you
always
to
cherish
our
dear
lord
never
allow
another
woman
to
rob
you
of
his
affection
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
dear
yukiko
have
you
been
able
to
understand
oh
my
dear
lady
protested
yukiko
do
not
i
entreat
you
say
such
strange
things
to
me
you
well
know
that
i
am
of
poor
and
mean
condition
how
could
i
ever
dare
to
aspire
to
become
the
wife
of
our
lord
nay
nay
returned
the
wife
huskily
this
is
not
a
time
for
words
of
ceremony
let
us
speak
only
the
truth
to
each
other
after
my
death
you
will
certainly
be
promoted
to
a
higher
place
and
i
now
assure
you
again
that
i
wish
you
to
become
the
wife
of
our
lord
yes
i
wish
this
yukiko
even
more
than
i
wish
to
become
a
buddha
ah
i
had
almost
forgotten
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
yukiko
you
know
that
in
the
garden
there
is
a
which
was
brought
here
the
year
before
last
from
mount
yoshino
in
yamato
i
have
been
told
that
it
is
now
in
full
bloom
and
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
it
in
flower
in
a
little
while
i
shall
be
dead
i
must
see
that
tree
before
i
die
now
i
wish
you
to
carry
me
into
the
garden
at
once
yukiko
so
that
i
can
see
it
yes
upon
your
back
yukiko
take
me
upon
your
back
while
thus
asking
her
voice
had
gradually
become
clear
and
strong
as
if
the
intensity
of
the
wish
had
given
her
new
force
then
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
yukiko
knelt
motionless
not
knowing
what
to
do
but
the
lord
nodded
assent
it
is
her
last
wish
in
this
world
he
said
she
always
loved
and
i
know
that
she
wanted
very
much
to
see
that
in
blossom
come
my
dear
yukiko
let
her
have
her
will
as
a
nurse
turns
her
back
to
a
child
that
the
child
may
cling
to
it
yukiko
offered
her
shoulders
to
the
wife
and
said
lady
i
am
ready
please
tell
me
how
i
best
can
help
you
why
this
way
responded
the
dying
woman
lifting
herself
with
an
almost
superhuman
effort
by
clinging
to
yukiko
shoulders
but
as
she
stood
erect
she
quickly
slipped
her
thin
hands
down
over
the
shoulders
under
the
robe
and
clutched
the
breasts
of
the
girl
and
burst
into
a
wicked
laugh
i
have
my
wish
she
i
have
my
wish
for
the
bloom
but
not
the
of
the
garden
i
could
not
die
before
i
got
my
wish
now
i
have
it
oh
what
a
delight
and
with
these
words
she
fell
forward
upon
the
crouching
girl
and
died
the
attendants
at
once
attempted
to
lift
the
body
from
shoulders
and
to
lay
it
upon
the
bed
but
strange
to
say
this
seemingly
easy
thing
could
not
be
done
the
cold
hands
had
attached
themselves
in
some
unaccountable
way
to
the
breasts
of
the
girl
appeared
to
have
grown
into
the
quick
flesh
yukiko
became
senseless
with
fear
and
pain
physicians
were
called
they
could
not
understand
what
had
taken
place
by
no
ordinary
methods
could
the
hands
of
the
dead
woman
be
unfastened
from
the
body
of
her
victim
they
so
clung
that
any
effort
to
remove
them
brought
blood
this
was
not
because
the
fingers
held
it
was
because
the
flesh
of
the
palms
had
united
itself
in
some
inexplicable
manner
to
the
flesh
of
the
breasts
at
that
time
the
most
skilful
physician
in
yedo
was
a
foreigner
a
dutch
surgeon
it
was
decided
to
summon
him
after
a
careful
examination
he
said
that
he
could
not
understand
the
case
and
that
for
the
immediate
relief
of
yukiko
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
cut
the
hands
from
the
corpse
he
declared
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
attempt
to
detach
them
from
the
breasts
his
advice
was
accepted
and
the
hands
were
amputated
at
the
wrists
but
they
remained
clinging
to
the
breasts
and
there
they
soon
darkened
and
dried
up
like
the
hands
of
a
person
long
dead
yet
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
horror
withered
and
bloodless
though
they
seemed
those
hands
were
not
dead
at
intervals
they
would
stir
stealthily
like
great
grey
spiders
and
nightly
thereafter
beginning
always
at
the
hour
of
the
ox
they
would
clutch
and
compress
and
torture
only
at
the
hour
of
the
tiger
the
pain
would
cease
yukiko
cut
off
her
hair
and
became
a
taking
the
religious
name
of
dassetsu
she
had
an
ibai
mortuary
tablet
made
bearing
the
kaimyo
of
her
dead
mistress
daishi
and
this
she
carried
about
with
her
in
all
her
wanderings
and
every
day
before
it
she
humbly
besought
the
dead
for
pardon
and
performed
a
buddhist
service
in
order
that
the
jealous
spirit
might
find
rest
but
the
evil
karma
that
had
rendered
such
an
affliction
possible
could
not
soon
be
exhausted
every
night
at
the
hour
of
the
ox
the
hands
never
failed
to
torture
her
during
more
than
seventeen
years
according
to
the
testimony
of
those
persons
to
whom
she
last
told
her
story
when
she
stopped
for
one
evening
at
the
house
of
noguchi
dengozayemon
in
the
village
of
tanaka
in
the
district
of
kawachi
in
the
province
of
shimotsuke
this
was
in
the
third
year
of
kokwa
thereafter
nothing
more
was
ever
heard
of
her
a
tale
of
ingwa
ingwa
is
a
japanese
buddhist
term
for
evil
karma
or
the
evil
consequence
of
faults
committed
in
a
former
state
of
existence
perhaps
the
curious
title
of
the
narrative
is
best
explained
by
the
buddhist
teaching
that
the
dead
have
power
to
injure
the
living
only
in
consequence
of
evil
actions
committed
by
their
victims
in
some
former
life
both
title
and
narrative
may
be
found
in
the
collection
of
weird
stories
entitled
a
variety
of
japanese
that
bears
in
japanese
poetry
and
proverbial
phraseology
the
physical
beauty
of
a
woman
is
compared
to
the
while
feminine
moral
beauty
is
compared
to
the
in
ancient
japanese
time
the
hour
of
the
ox
was
the
special
hour
of
ghosts
it
began
at
and
lasted
until
for
the
old
japanese
hour
was
double
the
length
of
the
modern
hour
the
hour
of
the
tiger
began
at
story
of
a
tengu
in
the
days
of
the
emperor
there
was
a
holy
priest
living
in
the
temple
of
saito
on
the
mountain
called
near
kyoto
one
summer
day
this
good
priest
after
a
visit
to
the
city
was
returning
to
his
temple
by
way
of
when
he
saw
some
boys
a
kite
they
had
caught
the
bird
in
a
snare
and
were
beating
it
with
sticks
oh
the
poor
creature
compassionately
exclaimed
the
priest
why
do
you
torment
it
so
children
one
of
the
boys
made
answer
we
want
to
kill
it
to
get
the
feathers
moved
by
pity
the
priest
persuaded
the
boys
to
let
him
have
the
kite
in
exchange
for
a
fan
that
he
was
carrying
and
he
set
the
bird
free
it
had
not
been
seriously
hurt
and
was
able
to
fly
away
happy
at
having
performed
this
buddhist
act
of
merit
the
priest
then
resumed
his
walk
he
had
not
proceeded
very
far
when
he
saw
a
strange
monk
come
out
of
a
by
the
and
hasten
towards
him
the
monk
respectfully
saluted
him
and
said
sir
through
your
compassionate
kindness
my
life
has
been
saved
and
i
now
desire
to
express
my
gratitude
in
a
fitting
manner
astonished
at
hearing
himself
thus
addressed
the
priest
replied
really
i
can
not
remember
to
have
ever
seen
you
before
please
tell
me
who
you
are
it
is
not
wonderful
that
you
can
not
recognize
me
in
this
form
returned
the
monk
i
am
the
kite
that
those
cruel
boys
were
tormenting
at
you
saved
my
life
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
more
precious
than
life
so
i
now
wish
to
return
your
kindness
in
some
way
or
other
if
there
be
anything
that
you
would
like
to
have
or
to
know
or
to
see
anything
that
i
can
do
for
you
in
short
please
to
tell
me
for
as
i
happen
to
possess
in
a
small
degree
the
six
supernatural
powers
i
am
able
to
gratify
almost
any
wish
that
you
can
express
on
hearing
these
words
the
priest
knew
that
he
was
speaking
with
a
tengu
and
he
frankly
made
answer
my
friend
i
have
long
ceased
to
care
for
the
things
of
this
world
i
am
now
seventy
years
of
age
neither
fame
nor
pleasure
has
any
attraction
for
me
i
feel
anxious
only
about
my
future
birth
but
as
that
is
a
matter
in
which
no
one
can
help
me
it
were
useless
to
ask
about
it
really
i
can
think
of
but
one
thing
worth
wishing
for
it
has
been
my
regret
that
i
was
not
in
india
in
the
time
of
the
lord
buddha
and
could
not
attend
the
great
assembly
on
the
holy
mountain
gridhrakuta
never
a
day
passes
in
which
this
regret
does
not
come
to
me
in
the
hour
of
morning
or
of
evening
prayer
ah
my
friend
if
it
were
possible
to
conquer
time
and
space
like
the
bodhisattvas
so
that
i
could
look
upon
that
marvellous
assembly
how
happy
should
i
be
why
the
tengu
exclaimed
that
pious
wish
of
yours
can
easily
be
satisfied
i
perfectly
well
remember
the
assembly
on
the
vulture
peak
and
i
can
cause
everything
that
happened
there
to
reappear
before
you
exactly
as
it
occurred
it
is
our
greatest
delight
to
represent
such
holy
matters
come
this
way
with
me
and
the
priest
suffered
himself
to
be
led
to
a
place
among
pines
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
now
said
the
tengu
you
have
only
to
wait
here
for
awhile
with
your
eyes
shut
do
not
open
them
until
you
hear
the
voice
of
the
buddha
preaching
the
law
then
you
can
look
but
when
you
see
the
appearance
of
the
buddha
you
must
not
allow
your
devout
feelings
to
influence
you
in
any
way
you
must
not
bow
down
nor
pray
nor
utter
any
such
exclamation
as
so
lord
or
thou
blessed
one
you
must
not
speak
at
all
should
you
make
even
the
least
sign
of
reverence
something
very
unfortunate
might
happen
to
me
the
priest
gladly
promised
to
follow
these
injunctions
and
the
tengu
hurried
away
as
if
to
prepare
the
spectacle
the
day
waned
and
passed
and
the
darkness
came
but
the
old
priest
waited
patiently
beneath
a
tree
keeping
his
eyes
closed
at
last
a
voice
suddenly
resounded
above
him
a
wonderful
voice
deep
and
clear
like
the
pealing
of
a
mighty
bell
the
voice
of
the
buddha
sakyamuni
proclaiming
the
perfect
way
then
the
priest
opening
his
eyes
in
a
great
radiance
perceived
that
all
things
had
been
changed
the
place
was
indeed
the
vulture
peak
the
holy
indian
mountain
gridhrakuta
and
the
time
was
the
time
of
the
sutra
of
the
lotos
of
the
good
law
now
there
were
no
pines
about
him
but
strange
shining
trees
made
of
the
seven
precious
substances
with
foliage
and
fruit
of
gems
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
mandarava
and
manjushaka
flowers
showered
from
heaven
and
the
night
was
filled
with
fragrance
and
splendour
and
the
sweetness
of
the
great
voice
and
in
shining
as
a
moon
above
the
world
the
priest
beheld
the
blessed
one
seated
upon
the
with
samantabhadra
at
his
right
hand
and
manjusri
at
his
left
and
before
them
assembled
immeasurably
spreading
into
space
like
a
flood
of
stars
the
hosts
of
the
mahasattvas
and
the
bodhisattvas
with
their
countless
following
gods
demons
nagas
goblins
men
and
beings
not
human
sariputra
he
saw
and
kasyapa
and
ananda
with
all
the
disciples
of
the
tathagata
and
the
kings
of
the
devas
and
the
kings
of
the
four
directions
like
pillars
of
fire
and
the
great
and
the
gandharvas
and
garudas
and
the
gods
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
wind
and
the
shining
myriads
of
brahma
heaven
and
incomparably
further
than
even
the
measureless
circling
of
the
glory
of
these
he
saw
made
visible
by
a
single
ray
of
light
that
shot
from
the
forehead
of
the
blessed
one
to
pierce
beyond
uttermost
time
the
eighteen
hundred
thousand
of
the
eastern
quarter
with
all
their
habitants
and
the
beings
in
each
of
the
six
states
of
existence
and
even
the
shapes
of
the
buddhas
extinct
that
had
entered
into
nirvana
these
and
all
the
gods
and
all
the
demons
he
saw
bow
down
before
the
and
he
heard
that
multitude
incalculable
of
beings
praising
the
sutra
of
the
lotos
of
the
good
law
like
the
roar
of
a
sea
before
the
lord
then
forgetting
utterly
his
pledge
foolishly
dreaming
that
he
stood
in
the
very
presence
of
the
very
buddha
he
cast
himself
down
in
worship
with
tears
of
love
and
thanksgiving
crying
out
with
a
loud
voice
o
thou
blessed
one
instantly
with
a
shock
as
of
earthquake
the
stupendous
spectacle
disappeared
and
the
priest
found
himself
alone
in
the
dark
kneeling
upon
the
grass
of
the
then
a
sadness
unspeakable
fell
upon
him
because
of
the
loss
of
the
vision
and
because
of
the
thoughtlessness
that
had
caused
him
to
break
his
word
as
he
sorrowfully
turned
his
steps
homeward
the
monk
once
more
appeared
before
him
and
said
to
him
in
tones
of
reproach
and
pain
because
you
did
not
keep
the
promise
which
you
made
to
me
and
heedlessly
allowed
your
feelings
to
overcome
you
the
gohotendó
who
is
the
guardian
of
the
doctrine
swooped
down
suddenly
from
heaven
upon
us
and
smote
us
in
great
anger
crying
out
do
ye
dare
thus
to
deceive
a
pious
person
then
the
other
monks
whom
i
had
assembled
all
fled
in
fear
as
for
myself
one
of
my
wings
has
been
broken
so
that
now
i
can
not
fly
and
with
these
words
the
tengu
vanished
forever
this
story
may
be
found
in
the
curious
old
japanese
book
called
the
same
legend
has
furnished
the
subject
of
an
interesting
called
the
great
assembly
in
japanese
popular
art
the
tengu
are
commonly
represented
either
as
winged
men
with
noses
or
as
birds
of
prey
there
are
different
kinds
of
tengu
but
all
are
supposed
to
be
spirits
capable
of
assuming
many
forms
and
occasionally
appearing
as
crows
vultures
or
eagles
buddhism
appears
to
class
the
tengu
among
the
marakayikas
at
yaidzu
i
under
a
bright
sun
the
old
of
yaidzu
has
a
particular
charm
of
neutral
color
it
takes
the
grey
tints
of
the
rude
grey
coast
on
which
it
rests
curving
along
a
little
bay
it
is
sheltered
from
heavy
seas
by
an
extraordinary
rampart
of
boulders
this
rampart
on
the
is
built
in
the
form
of
the
rounded
stones
of
which
it
is
composed
being
kept
in
position
by
a
sort
of
woven
between
rows
of
stakes
driven
deeply
into
the
ground
a
separate
row
of
stakes
sustaining
each
of
the
grades
looking
landward
from
the
top
of
the
structure
your
gaze
ranges
over
the
whole
town
a
broad
space
of
roofs
and
grey
timbers
with
here
and
there
a
marking
the
place
of
a
seaward
over
leagues
of
water
there
is
a
grand
view
a
jagged
blue
range
of
peaks
crowding
sharply
into
the
horizon
like
prodigious
amethysts
and
beyond
them
to
the
left
the
glorious
spectre
of
fuji
towering
enormously
above
everything
between
and
sea
there
is
no
sand
only
a
grey
slope
of
stones
chiefly
boulders
and
these
roll
with
the
surf
so
that
it
is
ugly
work
trying
to
pass
the
breakers
on
a
rough
day
if
you
once
get
struck
by
a
as
i
did
several
times
you
will
not
soon
forget
the
experience
at
certain
hours
the
greater
part
of
this
rough
slope
is
occupied
by
ranks
of
craft
of
a
form
peculiar
to
the
locality
they
are
very
large
capable
of
carrying
forty
or
fifty
men
each
and
they
have
queer
high
prows
to
which
buddhist
or
shinto
charms
mamori
or
shugo
are
usually
attached
a
common
form
of
shinto
written
charm
shugo
is
furnished
for
this
purpose
from
the
temple
of
the
goddess
of
fuji
the
text
reads
chojo
manzoku
meaning
that
the
owner
of
the
boat
pledges
himself
in
case
of
at
fishing
to
perform
great
austerities
in
honor
of
the
divinity
whose
shrine
is
upon
the
summit
of
fuji
in
every
of
japan
and
even
at
different
settlements
of
the
same
province
the
forms
of
boats
and
are
peculiar
to
the
district
or
settlement
indeed
it
will
sometimes
be
found
that
settlements
within
a
few
miles
of
each
other
respectively
manufacture
nets
or
boats
as
dissimilar
in
type
as
might
be
the
inventions
of
races
living
thousands
of
miles
apart
this
amazing
variety
may
be
in
some
degree
due
to
respect
for
local
tradition
to
the
pious
conservatism
that
preserves
ancestral
teaching
and
custom
unchanged
through
hundreds
of
years
but
it
is
better
explained
by
the
fact
that
different
communities
practise
different
kinds
of
fishing
and
the
shapes
of
the
nets
or
the
boats
made
at
any
one
place
are
likely
to
prove
on
investigation
the
inventions
of
a
special
experience
the
big
yaidzu
boats
illustrate
this
fact
they
were
devised
according
to
the
particular
requirements
of
the
which
supplies
dried
katsuo
bonito
to
all
parts
of
the
empire
and
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
able
to
ride
a
very
rough
sea
to
get
them
in
or
out
of
the
water
is
a
heavy
job
but
the
whole
village
helps
a
kind
of
slipway
is
improvised
in
a
moment
by
laying
flat
wooden
frames
on
the
slope
in
a
line
and
over
these
frames
the
bottomed
vessels
are
hauled
up
or
down
by
means
of
long
ropes
you
will
see
a
hundred
or
more
persons
thus
engaged
in
moving
a
single
boat
men
women
and
children
pulling
together
in
time
to
a
curious
melancholy
chant
at
the
coming
of
a
typhoon
the
boats
are
moved
far
back
into
the
streets
there
is
plenty
of
fun
in
helping
at
such
work
and
if
you
are
a
stranger
the
folk
will
perhaps
reward
your
pains
by
showing
you
the
wonders
of
their
sea
crabs
with
legs
of
astonishing
length
that
blow
themselves
up
in
the
most
absurd
manner
and
various
other
creatures
of
shapes
so
extraordinary
that
you
can
scarcely
believe
them
natural
without
touching
them
the
big
boats
with
holy
texts
at
their
prows
are
not
the
strangest
objects
on
the
beach
even
more
remarkable
are
the
of
split
bamboo
baskets
six
feet
high
and
eighteen
feet
round
with
one
small
hole
in
the
top
ranged
along
the
to
dry
they
might
at
some
distance
be
mistaken
for
habitations
or
huts
of
some
sort
then
you
see
great
wooden
anchors
shaped
like
ploughshares
and
shod
with
metal
iron
anchors
with
four
flukes
prodigious
wooden
mallets
used
for
driving
stakes
and
various
other
implements
still
more
unfamiliar
of
which
you
can
not
even
imagine
the
purpose
the
indescribable
antique
queerness
of
everything
gives
you
that
weird
sensation
of
remoteness
of
the
far
away
in
time
and
place
which
makes
one
doubt
the
reality
of
the
visible
and
the
life
of
yaidzu
is
certainly
the
life
of
many
centuries
ago
the
people
too
are
the
people
of
old
japan
frank
and
kindly
as
children
good
children
honest
to
a
fault
innocent
of
the
further
world
loyal
to
the
ancient
traditions
and
the
ancient
gods
ii
i
happened
to
be
at
yaidzu
during
the
three
days
of
the
bon
or
festival
of
the
dead
and
i
hoped
to
see
the
beautiful
farewell
ceremony
of
the
third
and
last
day
in
many
parts
of
japan
the
ghosts
are
furnished
with
miniature
ships
for
their
voyage
little
models
of
junks
or
each
containing
offerings
of
food
and
water
and
kindled
incense
also
a
tiny
lantern
or
lamp
if
the
be
despatched
at
night
but
at
yaidzu
lanterns
only
are
set
afloat
and
i
was
told
that
they
would
be
launched
after
dark
midnight
being
the
customary
hour
elsewhere
i
supposed
that
it
was
the
hour
of
farewell
at
yaidzu
also
and
i
rashly
indulged
in
a
nap
after
supper
expecting
to
wake
up
in
time
for
the
spectacle
but
by
ten
when
i
went
to
the
beach
again
all
was
over
and
everybody
had
gone
home
over
the
water
i
saw
something
like
a
long
swarm
of
flies
the
lanterns
drifting
out
to
sea
in
procession
but
they
were
already
too
far
to
be
distinguished
except
as
points
of
colored
light
i
was
much
disappointed
i
felt
that
i
had
lazily
missed
an
opportunity
which
might
never
again
return
for
these
old
are
dying
rapidly
but
in
another
moment
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
very
well
venture
to
swim
out
to
the
lights
they
were
moving
slowly
i
dropped
my
robe
on
the
beach
and
plunged
in
the
sea
was
calm
and
beautifully
phosphorescent
every
stroke
kindled
a
stream
of
yellow
fire
i
swam
fast
and
overtook
the
last
of
the
much
sooner
than
i
had
hoped
i
felt
that
it
would
be
unkind
to
interfere
with
the
little
embarcations
or
to
divert
them
from
their
silent
course
so
i
contented
myself
with
keeping
close
to
one
of
them
and
studying
its
details
the
structure
was
very
simple
the
bottom
was
a
piece
of
thick
plank
perfectly
square
and
measuring
about
ten
inches
across
each
one
of
its
corners
supported
a
slender
slick
about
sixteen
inches
high
and
these
four
uprights
united
above
by
pieces
sustained
the
paper
sides
upon
the
point
of
a
long
nail
driven
up
through
the
centre
of
the
bottom
was
fixed
a
lighted
candle
the
top
was
left
open
the
four
sides
presented
five
different
colors
blue
yellow
red
white
and
black
these
five
colors
respectively
symbolizing
ether
wind
fire
water
and
earth
the
five
buddhist
elements
which
are
metaphysically
identified
with
the
five
buddhas
one
of
the
was
red
one
blue
one
yellow
and
the
right
half
of
the
fourth
pane
was
black
while
the
left
half
uncolored
represented
white
no
kaimyo
was
written
upon
any
of
the
transparencies
inside
the
lantern
there
was
only
the
flickering
candle
i
watched
those
frail
glowing
shapes
drifting
through
the
night
and
ever
as
they
drifted
scattering
under
impulse
of
wind
and
wave
more
and
more
widely
apart
each
with
its
quiver
of
color
seemed
a
life
afraid
trembling
on
the
blind
current
that
was
bearing
it
into
the
outer
blackness
are
not
we
ourselves
as
lanterns
launched
upon
a
deeper
and
a
dimmer
sea
and
ever
separating
further
and
further
one
from
another
as
we
drift
to
the
inevitable
dissolution
soon
the
in
each
burns
itself
out
then
the
poor
frames
and
all
that
is
left
of
their
once
fair
colors
must
melt
forever
into
the
colorless
void
even
in
the
moment
of
this
musing
i
began
to
doubt
whether
i
was
really
alone
to
ask
myself
whether
there
might
not
be
something
more
than
a
mere
shuddering
of
light
in
the
thing
that
rocked
beside
me
some
presence
that
haunted
the
dying
flame
and
was
watching
the
watcher
a
faint
cold
thrill
passed
over
me
perhaps
some
chill
uprising
from
the
depths
perhaps
the
creeping
only
of
a
ghostly
fancy
old
superstitions
of
the
coast
recurred
to
me
old
vague
warnings
of
peril
in
the
time
of
the
passage
of
souls
i
reflected
that
were
any
evil
to
befall
me
out
there
in
the
night
meddling
or
seeming
to
meddle
with
the
lights
of
the
dead
i
should
myself
furnish
the
subject
of
some
future
weird
legend
i
whispered
the
buddhist
formula
of
farewell
to
the
lights
and
made
speed
for
shore
as
i
touched
the
stones
again
i
was
startled
by
seeing
two
white
shadows
before
me
but
a
kindly
voice
asking
if
the
water
was
cold
set
me
at
ease
it
was
the
voice
of
my
old
landlord
otokichi
the
fishseller
who
had
come
to
look
for
me
accompanied
by
his
wife
only
pleasantly
cool
i
made
answer
as
i
threw
on
my
robe
to
go
home
with
them
ah
said
the
wife
it
is
not
good
to
go
out
there
on
the
night
of
the
bon
i
did
not
go
far
i
replied
i
only
wanted
to
look
at
the
lanterns
even
a
kappa
gets
drowned
sometimes
protested
otokichi
there
was
a
man
of
this
village
who
swam
home
a
distance
of
seven
ri
in
bad
weather
after
his
boat
had
been
broken
but
he
was
drowned
afterwards
seven
ri
means
a
trifle
less
than
eighteen
miles
i
asked
if
any
of
the
young
men
now
in
the
settlement
could
do
as
much
probably
some
might
the
old
man
replied
there
are
many
strong
swimmers
all
swim
here
even
the
little
children
but
when
swim
like
that
it
is
only
to
save
their
lives
or
to
make
love
the
wife
added
like
the
hashima
girl
who
queried
i
a
fisherman
daughter
said
otokichi
she
had
a
lover
in
ajiro
several
ri
distant
and
she
used
to
swim
to
him
at
night
and
swim
back
in
the
morning
he
kept
a
light
burning
to
guide
her
but
one
dark
night
the
light
was
neglected
or
blown
out
and
she
lost
her
way
and
was
drowned
the
story
is
famous
in
idzu
so
i
said
to
myself
in
the
far
east
it
is
poor
hero
that
does
the
swimming
and
what
under
such
circumstances
would
have
been
the
western
estimate
of
leander
this
is
a
common
proverb
kappa
mo
the
kappa
is
a
haunting
rivers
especially
iii
usually
about
the
time
of
the
bon
the
sea
gets
rough
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
next
morning
that
the
surf
was
running
high
all
day
it
grew
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
waves
had
become
wonderful
and
i
sat
on
the
and
watched
them
until
sundown
it
was
a
long
slow
rolling
massive
and
formidable
sometimes
just
before
breaking
a
towering
swell
would
crack
all
its
green
length
with
a
tinkle
as
of
shivering
glass
then
would
fall
and
flatten
with
a
peal
that
shook
the
wall
beneath
me
i
thought
of
the
great
dead
russian
general
who
made
his
army
to
storm
as
a
sea
wave
upon
wave
of
steel
thunder
following
thunder
there
was
yet
scarcely
any
wind
but
there
must
have
been
wild
weather
elsewhere
and
the
breakers
were
steadily
heightening
their
motion
fascinated
how
indescribably
complex
such
motion
is
yet
how
eternally
new
who
could
fully
describe
even
five
minutes
of
it
no
mortal
ever
saw
two
waves
break
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
probably
no
mortal
ever
watched
the
or
heard
its
thunder
without
feeling
serious
i
have
noticed
that
even
animals
horses
and
cows
become
meditative
in
the
presence
of
the
sea
they
stand
and
stare
and
listen
as
if
the
sight
and
sound
of
that
immensity
made
them
forget
all
else
in
the
world
there
is
a
of
the
coast
the
sea
has
a
soul
and
hears
and
the
meaning
is
thus
explained
never
speak
of
your
fear
when
you
feel
afraid
at
sea
if
you
say
that
you
are
afraid
the
waves
will
suddenly
rise
higher
now
this
imagining
seems
to
me
absolutely
natural
i
must
confess
that
when
i
am
either
in
the
sea
or
upon
it
i
can
not
fully
persuade
myself
that
it
is
not
alive
a
conscious
and
a
hostile
power
reason
for
the
time
being
avails
nothing
against
this
fancy
in
order
to
be
able
to
think
of
the
sea
as
a
mere
body
of
water
i
must
be
upon
some
height
from
whence
its
heaviest
billowing
appears
but
a
lazy
creeping
of
tiny
ripples
but
the
primitive
fancy
may
be
roused
even
more
strongly
in
darkness
than
by
daylight
how
living
seem
the
smoulderings
and
the
flashings
of
the
tide
on
nights
of
phosphorescence
how
reptilian
the
subtle
shifting
of
the
tints
of
its
chilly
flame
dive
into
such
a
open
your
eyes
in
the
gloom
and
watch
the
weird
gush
of
lights
that
follow
your
every
motion
each
luminous
point
as
seen
through
the
flood
like
the
opening
and
closing
of
an
eye
at
such
a
moment
one
feels
indeed
as
if
enveloped
by
some
monstrous
sentiency
suspended
within
some
vital
substance
that
feels
and
sees
and
wills
alike
in
every
part
an
infinite
soft
cold
ghost
iv
long
i
lay
awake
that
night
and
listened
to
the
and
crashings
of
the
mighty
tide
deeper
than
these
distinct
shocks
of
noise
and
all
the
storming
of
the
nearer
waves
was
the
bass
of
the
further
surf
a
ceaseless
abysmal
muttering
to
which
the
building
trembled
a
sound
that
seemed
to
imagination
like
the
sound
of
the
trampling
of
infinite
cavalry
the
massing
of
incalculable
artillery
some
rushing
from
the
sunrise
of
armies
wide
as
the
world
then
i
found
myself
thinking
of
the
vague
terror
with
which
i
had
listened
when
a
child
to
the
voice
of
the
sea
and
i
remembered
that
in
on
different
coasts
in
different
parts
of
the
world
the
sound
of
surf
had
always
revived
the
childish
emotion
certainly
this
emotion
was
older
than
i
by
thousands
of
thousands
of
centuries
the
inherited
sum
of
numberless
terrors
ancestral
but
presently
there
came
to
me
the
conviction
that
fear
of
the
sea
alone
could
represent
but
one
element
of
the
multitudinous
awe
awakened
by
its
voice
for
as
i
listened
to
that
wild
tide
of
the
suruga
coast
i
could
distinguish
nearly
every
sound
of
fear
known
to
man
not
merely
noises
of
battle
tremendous
of
interminable
volleying
of
immeasurable
charging
but
the
roaring
of
beasts
the
crackling
and
hissing
of
fire
the
rumbling
of
earthquake
the
thunder
of
ruin
and
above
all
these
a
clamor
continual
as
of
shrieks
and
smothered
shoutings
the
voices
that
are
said
to
be
the
voices
of
the
awfulness
supreme
of
tumult
combining
all
imaginable
echoings
of
fury
and
destruction
and
despair
and
to
myself
i
said
is
it
wonderful
that
the
voice
of
the
sea
should
make
us
serious
consonantly
to
its
multiple
utterance
must
respond
all
waves
of
immemorial
fear
that
move
in
the
vaster
sea
of
deep
calleth
unto
deep
the
visible
abyss
calls
to
that
abyss
invisible
of
elder
being
whose
made
the
ghosts
of
us
wherefore
there
is
surely
more
than
a
little
truth
in
the
ancient
belief
that
the
speech
of
the
dead
is
the
roar
of
the
sea
truly
the
fear
and
the
pain
of
the
dead
past
speak
to
us
in
that
dim
deep
awe
which
the
roar
of
the
sea
awakens
but
there
are
sounds
that
move
us
much
more
profoundly
than
the
voice
of
the
sea
can
do
and
in
stranger
ways
sounds
that
also
make
us
serious
at
times
and
very
serious
sounds
of
music
great
music
is
a
psychical
storm
agitating
to
unimaginable
depth
the
mystery
of
the
past
within
us
or
we
might
say
that
it
is
a
prodigious
incantation
every
different
instrument
and
voice
making
separate
appeal
to
different
billions
of
prenatal
memories
there
are
tones
that
call
up
all
ghosts
of
youth
and
joy
and
tenderness
there
are
tones
that
evoke
all
phantom
pain
of
perished
passion
there
are
tones
that
resurrect
all
dead
sensations
of
majesty
and
might
and
glory
all
expired
exultations
all
forgotten
magnanimities
well
may
the
influence
of
music
seem
inexplicable
to
the
man
who
idly
dreams
that
his
life
began
less
than
a
hundred
years
ago
but
the
mystery
lightens
for
whomsoever
learns
that
the
substance
of
self
is
older
than
the
sun
he
finds
that
music
is
a
necromancy
he
feels
that
to
every
ripple
of
melody
to
every
billow
of
harmony
there
answers
within
him
out
of
the
sea
of
death
and
birth
some
eddying
immeasurable
of
ancient
pleasure
and
pain
pleasure
and
pain
they
commingle
always
in
great
music
and
therefore
it
is
that
music
can
move
us
more
profoundly
than
the
voice
of
ocean
or
than
any
other
voice
can
do
but
in
larger
utterance
it
is
ever
the
sorrow
that
makes
the
undertone
the
of
the
sea
of
soul
strange
to
think
how
vast
the
sum
of
joy
and
woe
that
must
have
been
experienced
before
the
sense
of
music
could
evolve
in
the
brain
of
man
somewhere
it
is
said
that
human
life
is
the
music
of
the
gods
that
its
sobs
and
laughter
its
songs
and
shrieks
and
orisons
its
outcries
of
delight
and
of
despair
rise
never
to
the
hearing
of
the
immortals
but
as
a
perfect
harmony
wherefore
they
could
not
desire
to
hush
the
tones
of
pain
it
would
spoil
their
music
the
combination
without
the
would
prove
a
discord
unendurable
to
ears
divine
and
in
one
way
we
ourselves
are
as
gods
since
it
is
only
the
sum
of
the
pains
and
the
joys
of
past
lives
innumerable
that
makes
for
us
through
memory
organic
the
ecstasy
of
music
all
the
gladness
and
the
grief
of
dead
generations
come
back
to
haunt
us
in
countless
forms
of
harmony
and
of
melody
even
so
a
million
years
after
we
shall
have
ceased
to
view
the
sun
will
the
gladness
and
the
grief
of
our
own
lives
pass
with
richer
music
into
other
hearts
there
to
bestir
for
one
mysterious
moment
some
deep
and
exquisite
thrilling
of
voluptuous
pain
