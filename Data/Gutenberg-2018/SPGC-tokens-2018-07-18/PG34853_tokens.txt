preface
during
the
years
this
study
first
took
shape
being
then
based
mainly
on
literary
sources
and
during
the
latter
year
it
was
successfully
presented
to
the
faculty
of
letters
of
the
university
of
rennes
brittany
for
the
degree
of
since
then
i
have
the
whole
problem
of
the
celtic
belief
in
fairies
and
have
collected
very
much
fresh
material
two
years
ago
the
scope
of
my
original
research
was
limited
to
the
four
chief
celtic
countries
but
now
it
includes
all
of
the
celtic
countries
in
the
present
study
which
has
profited
greatly
by
criticisms
of
the
first
passed
by
scholars
in
britain
and
in
france
the
original
literary
point
of
view
is
combined
with
the
broader
point
of
view
of
anthropology
this
study
the
final
and
more
comprehensive
form
of
my
views
about
the
would
never
have
been
possible
had
i
not
enjoyed
during
many
months
the
kindly
advice
and
constant
encouragement
of
marett
reader
in
social
anthropology
in
the
university
of
oxford
and
fellow
of
exeter
college
during
may
the
substance
of
this
essay
in
its
form
was
submitted
to
the
board
of
the
faculty
of
natural
science
of
oxford
university
for
the
research
degree
of
bachelor
of
science
which
was
duly
granted
but
the
present
work
contains
considerable
material
not
contained
in
the
essay
presented
to
the
oxford
examiners
the
right
hon
sir
john
rhŷs
and
andrew
lang
and
therefore
i
alone
assume
entire
responsibility
for
all
its
possible
shortcomings
and
in
particular
for
some
of
its
more
speculative
theories
which
to
some
minds
may
appear
to
be
in
conflict
with
orthodox
views
whether
of
the
theologian
or
of
the
man
of
science
these
theories
however
venturesome
they
may
appear
are
put
forth
in
almost
every
case
with
the
full
approval
of
some
reliable
scholarly
celt
and
as
such
they
are
chiefly
intended
to
make
the
exposition
of
the
belief
in
fairies
as
completely
and
as
truly
celtic
as
possible
without
much
regard
for
opinion
whether
this
be
in
harmony
with
celtic
opinion
or
not
as
the
new
manuscript
of
the
lies
before
me
revised
and
finished
i
realize
even
more
fully
than
i
did
two
years
ago
with
respect
to
the
original
study
how
little
right
i
have
to
call
it
mine
those
to
whom
the
credit
for
it
really
belongs
are
my
many
kind
friends
and
helpers
in
ireland
scotland
isle
of
man
wales
cornwall
and
brittany
and
many
others
who
are

great

so
intimately
united
now
by
unbreakable
bonds
of
goodwill
and
international
brotherhood
britain
france
and
the
united
states
of
america
for
without
the
aid
of
all
these
celtic
and
friends
the
work
could
never
have
been
accomplished
they
have
given
me
their
best
and
rarest
thoughts
as
so
many
golden
threads
i
have
only
furnished
the
mental
loom
and
woven
these
golden
threads
together
in
my
own
way
according
to
what
i
take
to
be
the
psychological
pattern
of
the
i
am
under
a
special
obligation
to

following
six
distinguished

different

with
the

feels

i
acknowledge

who
have
been
my
celtic

here

have
run
up

account
with

right
hon
sir
john

the
professor
of

who
has
introduced
me
to

irish
and
of

romance
and
mythology
and
has
guided
me
both
during
the
year
and
ever
since
in
celtic
generally
to
andrew
lang
i
am
likewise
a
debtor
more
especially
in
view
of
the
important
suggestions
which
he
has
given
me
during
the
past
two
years
with
respect
to

and
to

research
in
my
relation
to
the
faculty
of

of

i
shall
always
remember
the
friendly

assistance
offered
to
me
there
during

by

continual
good

towards

have
been

in

have
told
what
i
have
seen
what
i
have
thought
and
what
i
have
learned
by
herodotus
i
the
religious
nature
of
the
there
is
probably
no
other
place
in
celtic
lands
more
congenial
or
more
inspiring
for
the
writing
down
of
one
deeper
intuitions
about
the
than
carnac
under
the
shadow
of
the
pagan
tumulus
and
mount
of
the
sacred
fire
now
dedicated
by
triumphant
christianity
to
the
archangel
michael
the
very
name
of
carnac
is
significant
and
in
two
continents
africa
and
europe
to
follow
the
certain
evidence
of
archaeology
alone
there
seem
to
have
been
no
greater
centres
for
ancient
religion
than
karnak
in
egypt
and
carnac
in
brittany
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
children
of
isis
and
osiris
erected
temples
as
perfect
as
human
art
can
make
them
on
the
shores
of
the
morbihan
the
mighty
men
who
were
as
it
seems
the
teachers
of
our
own
celtic
forefathers
erected

unhewn
stone

and

with
the
alignements
of

each
in
their
own
way
record
more
or
less
perfectly

attempt
to
express
materially
what
he
feels
spiritually
perfected
art
can
beautify
and
make
more
attractive
to
the
eye
and
mind
but
it
can
not
enhance
in
any
degree
the
innate
spiritual
ideals
which
men
in
all
ages
have
held
and
thus
it
is
that
we
read
amid
the
rough
stone
menhirs
and
dolmens
in
brittany
as
amid
the
polished
granite
monoliths
and
magnificent
temples
in
egypt
the
same
silent
message
from
the
past
to
the
present
from
the
dead
to
the
living
this
message
we
think
is
fundamentally
important
in
understanding
the
celtic
for
in
our
opinion
the
belief
in
fairies
has
the
same
origin
as
all
religions
and
mythologies
and
there
seems
never
to
have
been
an
uncivilized
tribe
a
race
or
nation
of
civilized
men
who
have
not
had
some
form
of
belief
in
an
unseen
world
peopled
by
unseen
beings
in
religions
mythologies
and
the
too
we
behold
the
attempts
which
have
been
made
by
different
peoples
in
different
ages
to
explain
in
terms
of
human
experience
this
unseen
world
its
inhabitants
its
laws
and
relation
to
it
the
ancients
called
its
inhabitants
gods
genii
daemons
and
shades
christianity
knows
them
as
angels
saints
demons
and
souls
of
the
dead
to
uncivilized
tribes
they
are
gods
demons
and
spirits
of
ancestors
and
the
celts
think
of
them
as
gods
and
as
fairies
of
many
kinds
ii
the
interpretation
of
the
by
the
celtic
we
mean
that
specialized
form
of
belief
in
a
spiritual
realm
inhabited
by
spiritual
beings
which
has
existed
from
prehistoric
times
until
now
in
ireland
scotland
isle
of
man
wales
cornwall
brittany
or
other
parts
of
the
ancient
empire
of
the
celts
in
studying
this
belief
we
are
concerned
directly
with
living
celtic
and
with
past
celtic
as
recorded
in
literature
and
if
fairies
actually
exist
as
invisible
beings
or
intelligences
and
our
investigations
lead
us
to
the
tentative
hypothesis
that
they
do
they
are
natural
and
not
supernatural
for
nothing
which
exists
can
be
supernatural
and
therefore
it
is
our
duty
to
examine
the
celtic
fairy
races
just
as
we
examine
any
fact
in
the
visible
realm
wherein
we
now
live
whether
it
be
a
fact
of
chemistry
of
physics
or
of
biology
however
as
we
proceed
to
make
such
an
examination
we
shall
have
to
remember
constantly
that
there
is
a
new
set
of
ideas
to
work
with
entirely
different
from
what
we
find
in
natural
sciences
and
often
no
adequate
vocabulary
based
on
common
human
experiences
an
american
who
has
travelled
in
asia
and
an
englishman
who
has
travelled
in
australia
may
meet
in
paris
and
exchange
travelling
experiences
with
mutual
understanding
because
both
of
them
have
experienced
travel
and
they
will
have
an
adequate
vocabulary
to
describe
each
experience
because
most
men
have
also
experienced
travel
but
a
saint
who
has
known
the
spiritual
condition
called
ecstasy
can
not
explain
ecstasy
to
a
man
who
has
never
known
it
and
if
he
should
try
to
do
so
would
discover
at
once
that
no
modern
language
is
suitable
for
the
purpose
his
experience
is
rare
and
not
universal
and
men
have
developed
no
complete
vocabulary
to
describe
experiences
not
common
to
the
majority
of
mankind
and
this
is
especially
true
of
psychical
experiences
it
is
the
same
in
dealing
with
fairies
as
these
are
hypothetically
conceived
for
only
a
few
men
and
women
can
assert
that
they
have
seen
fairies
and
hence
there
is
no
adequate
vocabulary
to
describe
fairies
among
the
ancients
who
dealt
so
largely
with
psychical
sciences
there
seems
to
have
been
a
common
language
which
could
be
used
to
explain
the
invisible
world
and
its
inhabitants
but
we
of
this
age
have
not
yet
developed
such
a
language
consequently
men
who
deny
human
immortality
as
well
as
men
with
religious
faith
who
have
not
through
personal
psychical
experiences
transformed
that
faith
into
a
fact
nowadays
when
they
happen
to
read
what
plato
iamblichus
or
any
of
the
have
written
or
even
what
moderns
have
written
in
attempting
to
explain
psychic
facts
call
it
all
mysticism
and
to
the
great
majority
of
europeans
and
americans
mysticism
is
a
most
convenient
noun
applicable
to
anything
which
may
seem
reasonable
yet
wholly
untranslatable
in
terms
of
their
own
individual
experience
and
mysticism
usually
means
something
quite
the
reverse
of
scientific
simply
because
we
have
by
usage
unwisely
limited
the
meaning
of
the
word
to
a
knowledge
of
things
material
and
visible
whereas
it
really
means
a
knowing
or
a
knowledge
of
everything
which
exists
we
have
tried
to
deal
with
the
rare
psychical
experiences
of
irish
scotch
manx
welsh
or
breton
seers
and
psychics
generally
in
the
clearest
language
possible
but
if
now
and
then
we
are
charged
with
being
mystical
this
is
our
defence
iii
the
method
of
studying
the
in
this
study
which
is
first
of
all
a
study
we
pursue
principally
an
method
of
interpreting
the
celtic
belief
in
fairies
though
we
do
not
hesitate
now
and
then
to
call
in
the
aid
of
philology
and
we
make
good
use
of
the
evidence
offered
by
mythologies
religions
metaphysics
and
physical
sciences
a
century
ago
was
considered
beneath
the
serious
consideration
of
scholars
but
there
has
come
about
a
complete
reversal
of
scholarly
opinion
for
now
it
is
seen
that
the
beliefs
of
the
people
their
legends
and
their
songs
are
the
source
of
nearly
all
literatures
and
that
their
institutions
and
customs
are
the
origin
of
those
of
modern
times
and
to
the
new
science
of
which
as
andrew
lang
says
must
be
taken
to
include
psychical
research
or
psychical
sciences
archaeology
anthropology
and
comparative
mythology
and
religion
are
indispensable
thus
offers
the
scientific
means
of
studying
man
in
the
sense
meant
by
the
poet
who
declared
that
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
iv
divisions
of
the
study
this
study
is
divided
into
four
sections
or
parts
the
first
one
deals
with
the
living
among
the
celts
themselves
the
second
with
the
recorded
and
ancient
as
we
find
it
in
celtic
literature
and
mythology
the
third
with
the
in
its
religious
aspects
and
in
the
fourth
section
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
suggest
how
the
theories
of
our
newest
science
psychical
research
explain
the
belief
in
fairies
i
have
set
forth
in
the
first
section
in
detail
and
as
clearly
as
possible
the
testimony
communicated
to
me
by
living
celts
who
either
believe
in
fairies
or
else
say
that
they
have
seen
fairies
and
throughout
other
sections
i
have
preferred
to
draw
as
much
as
possible
of
the
material
from
men
and
women
rather
than
from
books
books
too
often
are
written
out
of
other
books
and
too
seldom
from
the
life
of
man
and
in
a
scientific
study
of
the
such
as
we
have
undertaken
the
celt
himself
is
by
far
the
best
in
fact
the
only
authority
for
us
it
is
much
less
important
to
know
what
scholars
think
of
fairies
than
to
know
what
the
celtic
people
think
of
fairies
this
is
especially
true
in
considering
the
as
it
exists
now
the
collecting
of
material
in
june
after
a
year
preparatory
work
in
things
celtic
under
the
direction
of
the
oxford
professor
of
celtic
sir
john
rhŷs
i
began
to
travel
in
wales
ireland
scotland
and
brittany
and
to
collect
material
there
at
first
hand
from
the
people
who
have
shaped
and
who
still
keep
alive
the
and
during
the
year
fresh
expeditions
were
made
into
brittany
ireland
and
wales
and
then
finally
the
study
of
the
was
made
by
similar
expeditions
throughout
the
isle
of
man
and
into
cornwall
many
of
the
most
remote
parts
of
these
lands
were
visited
and
often
there
was
no
other
plan
to
adopt
or
any
method
better
or
more
natural
than
to
walk
day
after
day
from
one
cottage
to
another
living
on
the
simple
wholesome
food
of
the
peasants
sometimes
there
was
the
picturesque
to
climb
sometimes
the
route
lay
through
marshy
or
across
a
rolling
country
and
with
each
change
of
landscape
came
some
new
thought
and
some
new
impression
of
the
celtic
life
or
perhaps
some
new
description
of
a
fairy
this
immersion
in
the
most
striking
natural
and
social
environment
of
the
celtic
race
gave
me
an
insight
into
the
mind
the
religion
the
mysticism
and
the
very
heart
of
the
celt
himself
such
as
no
mere
study
in
libraries
ever
could
do
i
tried
to
see
the
world
as
he
does
i
participated
in
his
innermost
thoughts
about
the
great
problem
of
life
and
death
with
which
he
of
all
peoples
is
most
deeply
concerned
and
thus
he
revealed
to
me
the
source
of
his
highest
ideals
and
inspirations
i
daily
felt
the
deep
and
innate
seriousness
of
his
ancestral
nature
and
living
as
he
lives
i
tried
in
all
ways
to
be
like
him
i
was
particularly
qualified
for
such
an
undertaking
partly
celtic
myself
by
blood
and
perhaps
largely
so
by
temperament
i
found
it
easy
to
sympathize
with
the
celt
and
with
his
environments
further
being
by
birth
an
american
i
was
in
many
places
privileged
to
enter
where
an
englishman
or
a
of
europe
would
not
be
and
my
education
under
the
free
ideals
of
a
democracy
always
made
it
possible
for
me
to
view
economic
political
religious
and
racial
questions
in
celtic
lands
apart
from
the
european
point
of
view
and
without
the
european
prejudices
which
are
so
numerous
and
so
greatly
to
be
regretted
but
without
any
doubt
during
my
sojourn
extending
over
three
years
among
the
celts
these
various
environments
shaped
my
thoughts
about
fairies
and
fairyland
as
they
ought
to
have
done
if
truth
is
ever
to
be
reached
by
research
these
experiences
of
mine
lead
me
to
believe
that
the
natural
aspects
of
celtic
countries
much
more
than
those
of
most
countries
impress
man
and
awaken
in
him
some
unfamiliar
part
of
himself
call
it
the
subconscious
self
the
subliminal
self
the
ego
or
what
you
will
which
gives
him
an
unusual
power
to
know
and
to
feel
invisible
or
psychical
influences
what
is
there
for
example
in
london
or
paris
or
berlin
or
new
york
to
awaken
the
intuitive
power
of
man
that
subconsciousness
in
him
equal
to
the
solitude
of
those
magical
environments
of
nature
which
the
celts
enjoy
and
love
in
my
travels
when
the
weather
was
too
wild
to
venture
out
by
day
or
when
the
more
favourable
hours
of
the
night
had
arrived
with
fires
and
candles
lit
or
even
during
a
chat
amid
the
day
journey
there
was
gathered
together
little
by
little
from
one
country
and
another
the
mass
of
testimony
which
chapter
ii
contains
and
with
all
this
my
opinions
began
to
take
shape
for
when
i
set
out
from
oxford
in
june
i
had
no
certain
or
clear
ideas
as
to
what
fairies
are
nor
why
there
should
be
belief
in
them
in
less
than
a
year
afterwards
i
found
myself
committed
to
the
psychological
theory
which
i
am
herein
setting
forth
vi
theories
of
the
we
make
continual
reference
throughout
our
study
to
this
psychological
theory
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
the
celtic
and
it
is
one
of
our
purposes
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
the
root
theory
which
includes
or
absorbs
the
four
theories
already
advanced
to
account
for
the
belief
in
fairies
to
guide
the
reader
in
his
own
conclusions
we
shall
here
briefly
outline
these
four
theories
the
first
of
them
may
be
called
the
naturalistic
theory
which
is
that
in
ancient
and
in
modern
times
man
belief
in
gods
spirits
or
fairies
has
been
the
direct
result
of
his
attempts
to
explain
or
to
rationalize
natural
phenomena
of
this
theory
we
accept
as
true
that
the
belief
in
fairies
often
anthropomorphically
reflects
the
natural
environment
as
well
as
the
social
condition
of
the
people
who
hold
the
belief
for
example
amid
the
beautiful
green
hills
and
gentle
dells
of
connemara
ireland
the
people
are
just
as
beautiful
just
as
gentle
and
just
as
happy
as
their
environment
while
amid
the
mountains
and
in
the
mysterious
lakes
of
the
scotch
highlands
there
are
fiercer
kinds
of
fairies
and
terrible
and
in
the
western
hebrides
there
is
the
moving
through
the
air
at
night
the
naturalistic
theory
shows
accurately
enough
that
natural
phenomena
and
environment
have
given
direction
to
the
anthropomorphosing
of
gods
spirits
or
fairies
but
after
explaining
this
external
aspect
of
the
it
can
not
logically
go
any
further
or
if
illogically
it
does
attempt
to
explain
the
belief
in
gods
spirits
or
fairies
as
due
entirely
to
material
causes
it
becomes
in
our
opinion
like
the
psychology
of
fifty
years
ago
obsolete
for
now
the
new
psychology
or
psychical
research
has
been
forced
to
admit
if
only
as
a
working
hypothesis
the
possibility
of
invisible
intelligences
or
entities
able
to
influence
man
and
nature
we
seem
even
to
be
approaching
a
scientific
proof
of
the
doctrines
of
such
ancient
philosophical
scientists
as
pythagoras
and
plato
that
all
external
nature
animated
throughout
and
controlled
in
its
phenomena
by
daemons
acting
by
the
will
of
gods
is
to
men
nothing
more
than
the
visible
effects
of
an
unseen
world
of
causes
in
the
internal
aspects
of
the
the
fundamental
fact
seems
clearly
to
be
that
there
must
have
been
in
the
minds
of
prehistoric
men
as
there
is
now
in
the
minds
of
modern
men
a
germ
idea
of
a
fairy
for
environment
to
act
upon
and
shape
without
an
object
to
act
upon
environment
can
accomplish
nothing
this
is
evident
the
naturalistic
theory
examines
only
the
environment
and
its
effects
and
forgets
altogether
the
germ
idea
of
a
fairy
to
be
acted
upon
but
the
psychological
theory
remembers
and
attempts
to
explain
the
germ
idea
of
a
fairy
and
the
effect
of
nature
upon
it
the
second
theory
may
be
called
the
pygmy
theory
which
david
macritchie
who
is
definitely
committed
to
it
has
so
clearly
set
forth
in
his
work
entitled
testimony
of
this
theory
is
that
the
whole
has
grown
up
out
of
a
of
an
actual
pygmy
race
this
race
is
supposed
to
have
been
a
very
early
prehistoric
probably
mongolian
race
which
inhabited
the
british
islands
and
many
parts
of
continental
europe
when
the
celtic
nations
appeared
these
pygmies
were
driven
into
mountain
fastnesses
and
into
the
most
inaccessible
places
where
a
few
of
them
may
have
survived
until
comparatively
historical
times
over
against
the
champions
of
the
pygmy
theory
may
be
set
two
of
its
opponents
bertram
windle
and
andrew
lang
windle
in
his
introduction
to
tyson
essay
concerning
the
pygmies
of
the
makes
these
six
most
destructive
criticisms
or
points
against
the
theory
so
far
as
our
present
knowledge
teaches
us
there
never
was
a
really
pygmy
race
inhabiting
the
northern
parts
of
scotland
the
mounds
with
which
the
tales
of
little
people
are
associated
have
not
in
many
cases
been
habitations
but
were
natural
or
sepulchral
in
their
nature
little
people
are
not
by
any
means
associated
entirely
with
mounds
the
association
of
giants
and
dwarfs
in
traditions
confuses
the
theory
there
are
fairies
where
no
pygmies
ever
were
as
for
example
in
north
america
even
eskimos
and
lapps
have
fairy
beliefs
and
could
not
have
been
the
original
fairies
of
more
modern
altogether
as
we
think
our
study
will
show
the
evidence
of
the
itself
gives
only
a
slender
and
superficial
support
to
the
pygmy
theory
we
maintain
that
the
theory
so
far
as
it
is
provable
and
this
is
evidently
not
very
far
is
only
one
strand
contributed
by
ethnology
and
social
psychology
in
the
complex
fabric
of
the
and
is
as
such
woven
round
a
psychical
central
pattern
the
fundamental
pattern
of
the
therefore
from
our
point
of
view
the
pygmy
theory
is
altogether
inadequate
because
it
overlooks
or
misinterprets
the
most
essential
and
prominent
elements
in
the
belief
which
the
celtic
peoples
hold
concerning
fairies
and
fairyland
the
druid
theory
to
account
for
fairies
is
less
widespread
it
is
that
the
of
the
druids
and
their
magical
practices
is
alone
responsible
for
the
the
first
suggestion
of
this
theory
seems
to
have
been
made
by
the
rev
cririe
in
his
published
in
three
years
later
the
rev
graham
published
an
identical
hypothesis
in
his
descriptive
of
picturesque
scenery
on
the
southern
confines
of
macritchie
suggests
with
all
reason
that
the
two
writers
probably
had
discussed
together
the
theory
and
hence
both
put
it
forth
alfred
maury
in
fées
du
published
in
at
paris
appears
to
have
made
liberal
use
of
patrick
graham
suggestions
in
propounding
his
theory
that
the
or
fairy
women
of
the
middle
ages
are
due
to
a
of
druidesses
maury
seems
to
have
forgotten
that
throughout
pagan
britain
and
ireland
both
much
more
important
for
the
study
of
fairies
than
celtic
europe
during
the
middle
ages
druids
rather
than
druidesses
had
the
chief
influence
on
the
people
and
that
yet
despite
this
fact
irish
and
welsh
mythology
is
full
of
stories
about
fairy
women
coming
from
the
otherworld
nor
is
there
any
proof
or
even
good
ground
for
argument
that
the
irish
fairy
women
are
a
of
druidesses
for
if
there
ever
were
druidesses
in
ireland
they
played
a
subordinate
and
very
insignificant
rôle
as
in
the
case
of
the
pygmy
theory
we
maintain
that
the
druid
theory
also
is
inadequate
it
discovers
a
real
anthropomorphic
influence
at
work
on
the
outward
aspects
of
the
and
illogically
takes
that
to
be
the
origin
of
the
the
fourth
theory
the
mythological
theory
is
of
very
great
importance
it
is
that
fairies
are
the
diminished
figures
of
the
old
pagan
divinities
of
the
early
celts
and
many
modern
authorities
on
celtic
mythology
and
hold
it
to
us
the
theory
is
acceptable
so
far
as
it
goes
but
it
is
not
adequate
in
itself
nor
is
it
the
root
theory
because
a
belief
in
gods
and
goddesses
must
in
turn
be
explained
and
in
making
this
explanation
we
arrive
at
the
psychological
theory
which
this
study
perhaps
the
first
one
of
its
kind
attempts
to
set
forth
vii
the
importance
of
studying
the
i
have
made
a
very
careful
personal
investigation
of
the
surviving
celtic
by
living
for
many
months
with
and
among
the
people
who
preserve
it
i
have
compared
fairy
phenomena
and
the
phenomena
said
to
be
caused
by
gods
genii
daemons
or
spirits
of
different
kinds
and
recorded
in
the
writings
of
ancient
mediaeval
and
modern
metaphysical
philosophers
christian
and
pagan
saints
mystics
and
seers
and
now
more
or
less
clearly
substantiated
by
from
thirty
to
forty
years
of
experimentation
in
psychical
sciences
by
eminent
scientists
of
our
own
times
such
as
sir
william
crookes
and
sir
oliver
lodge
in
england
and
camille
flammarion
in
france
as
a
result
i
am
convinced
of
the
very
great
value
of
a
serious
study
of
the
the
as
the
of
the
celts
ought
like
all
religions
to
be
studied
sympathetically
as
well
as
scientifically
to
those
who
take
a
materialistic
view
of
life
and
consequently
deny
the
existence
of
spirits
or
invisible
intelligences
such
as
fairies
are
said
to
be
we
should
say
as
my
honoured
american
teacher
in
psychology
the
late
william
james
of
harvard
used
to
say
in
his
lectures
at
stanford
university
considered
as
a
system
of
philosophy
never
tries
to
explain
the
of
things
but
in
our
study
of
the
we
shall
attempt
to
deal
with
this
of
things
and
then
perhaps
the
value
of
studying
fairies
and
fairyland
will
be
more
apparent
even
to
materialists
the
great
majority
of
men
in
cities
are
apt
to
pride
themselves
on
their
own
exemption
from
and
to
smile
pityingly
at
the
poor
countrymen
and
countrywomen
who
believe
in
fairies
but
when
they
do
so
they
forget
that
with
all
their
own
admirable
progress
in
material
invention
with
all
the
data
of
their
acquired
science
with
all
the
vast
extent
of
their
commercial
and
economic
conquests
they
themselves
have
ceased
to
be
natural
wherever
under
modern
conditions
great
multitudes
of
men
and
women
are
herded
together
there
is
bound
to
be
an
unhealthy
psychical
atmosphere
never
found
in
the
country
an
atmosphere
which
inevitably
tends
to
develop
in
the
average
man
who
is
not
psychically
strong
enough
to
resist
it
lower
at
the
expense
of
higher
forces
or
qualities
and
thus
to
inhibit
any
normal
attempts
of
the
subliminal
self
a
psychological
entity
to
manifest
itself
in
consciousness
in
this
connexion
it
is
highly
significant
to
note
that
as
far
as
can
be
determined
almost
all
professed
materialists
of
the
uncritical
type
and
even
most
of
those
who
are
thinking
and
philosophizing
sceptics
about
the
existence
of
a
supersensuous
realm
or
state
of
conscious
being
are
or
have
been
usually
so
by
birth
and
breeding
and
even
where
we
find
materialists
of
either
type
dwelling
in
the
country
we
generally
find
them
so
completely
under
the
hypnotic
sway
of
city
influences
and
mould
of
thought
in
matters
of
education
and
culture
and
in
matters
touching
religion
that
they
have
lost
all
sympathetic
and
responsive
contact
with
nature
because
unconsciously
they
have
thus
permitted
conventionality
and
unnaturalness
to
insulate
them
from
it
the
celtic
peasant
who
may
be
their
tenant
or
neighbour
is
if
still
uncorrupted
by
them
in
direct
contrast
unconventional
and
natural
he
is
normally
always
responsive
to
psychical
influences
as
much
so
as
an
australian
arunta
or
an
american
red
man
who
also
like
him
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
escaped
being
corrupted
by
what
we
egotistically
to
distinguish
ourselves
from
them
call
if
our
celtic
peasant
has
psychical
experiences
or
if
he
sees
an
apparition
which
he
calls
one
of
the
people
that
is
to
say
a
fairy
it
is
useless
to
try
to
persuade
him
that
he
is
under
a
delusion
unlike
his
lord
he
would
not
attempt
nor
even
desire
to
make
himself
believe
that
what
he
has
seen
he
has
not
seen
not
only
has
he
the
will
to
believe
but
he
has
the
right
to
believe
because
his
belief
is
not
a
matter
of
being
educated
and
reasoning
logically
nor
a
matter
of
faith
and
theology
it
is
a
fact
of
his
own
individual
experiences
as
he
will
tell
you
such
peasant
seers
have
frequently
argued
with
me
to
the
effect
that
does
not
have
to
be
educated
in
order
to
see
fairies
unlike
the
natural
mind
of
the
uncorrupted
celt
arunta
or
american
red
man
which
is
ever
open
to
unusual
psychical
impressions
the
mind
of
the
business
man
in
our
great
cities
tends
to
be
obsessed
with
business
affairs
both
during
his
waking
and
during
his
dream
states
the
politician
with
politics
similarly
the
with
society
and
the
unwholesome
excitement
felt
by
day
in
the
city
is
apt
to
be
heightened
at
night
through
a
satisfying
of
the
feeling
which
it
morbidly
creates
for
relaxation
and
change
of
stimuli
in
the
slums
humanity
is
divorced
from
nature
under
even
worse
conditions
and
becomes
wholly
decadent
but
in
slum
and
in
palace
alike
there
is
continually
a
feverish
induced
by
unrest
and
worry
there
is
impure
and
air
a
lack
of
sunshine
a
substitution
of
artificial
objects
for
natural
objects
and
in
place
of
solitude
the
eternal
din
of
traffic
instead
of
nature
men
in
cities
and
paradoxically
some
conventionalized
men
in
the
country
have
and
are
like
these
nature
unnatural
children
who
grind
out
their
lives
in
an
unceasing
struggle
for
wealth
and
power
social
position
and
even
for
bread
fit
to
judge
nature
natural
children
who
believe
in
fairies
are
they
right
in
not
believing
in
an
invisible
world
which
they
can
not
conceive
which
if
it
exists
they
even
though
they
be
scientists
are
through
environment
and
temperament
alike
incapable
of
knowing
or
is
the
the
sometimes
and
the
dreaming
and
peasant
right
these
questions
ought
to
arouse
in
the
minds
of
anthropologists
very
serious
reflection
in
its
scope
at
all
events
and
equally
for
the
unbeliever
and
for
the
believer
the
study
of
the
is
of
vast
importance
historically
philosophically
religiously
and
scientifically
in
it
lie
the
germs
of
much
of
our
european
religions
and
philosophies
customs
and
institutions
and
it
is
one
of
the
chief
keys
to
unlock
the
mysteries
of
celtic
mythology
we
believe
that
a
greater
age
is
coming
soon
when
all
the
ancient
mythologies
will
be
carefully
studied
and
interpreted
and
when
the
mythology
of
the
celts
will
be
held
in
very
high
esteem
but
already
an
age
has
come
when
things
purely
celtic
have
begun
to
be
studied
and
the
close
observer
can
see
the
awakening
genius
of
the
modern
celt
manifesting
itself
in
the
realm
of
scholarship
of
literature
and
even
of
art
throughout
continental
europe
especially
france
and
germany
throughout
great
britain
and
ireland
and
throughout
the
new
celtic
world
of
america
as
far
west
as
san
francisco
on
the
great
calm
ocean
of
the
future
facing
japan
and
china
in
truth
the
celtic
empire
is
greater
than
it
ever
was
before
caesar
destroyed
its
political
unity
and
its
citizens
have
not
forgotten
the
ancient
faith
of
their
ancestors
in
a
world
invisible
section
i
the
living
chapter
i
environment
the
beauty
of
the
world
lies
the
ultimate
redemption
of
our
mortality
when
we
shall
become
at
one
with
nature
in
a
sense
profounder
even
than
the
poetic
imaginings
of
most
of
us
we
shall
understand
what
now
we
fail
to
discern
fiona
macleod
psychical
interpretation
the
mysticism
of
erin
and
armorica
in
ireland
in
scotland
in
the
isle
of
man
in
wales
in
cornwall
in
brittany
as
a
preliminary
to
our
study
it
is
important
as
we
shall
see
later
to
give
some
attention
to
the
influences
and
purely
natural
environment
under
which
the
has
grown
up
and
in
doing
so
it
will
be
apparent
to
what
extent
there
is
truth
in
the
naturalistic
theory
though
from
the
first
our
interpretation
of
environment
is
fundamentally
psychical
in
this
first
chapter
then
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
recorded
we
shall
record
a
few
impressions
which
will
in
a
way
serve
as
introductory
to
the
more
definite
and
detailed
consideration
of
the
itself
ireland
and
brittany
the
two
extremes
of
the
modern
celtic
world
are
for
us
the
most
important
points
from
which
to
take
our
initial
bearings
both
washed
by
the
waters
of
the
ocean
of
atlantis
the
one
an
island
the
other
a
peninsula
they
have
best
preserved
their
old
racial
life
in
its
simplicity
and
beauty
with
its
high
ideals
its
mystical
traditions
and
its
strong
spirituality
and
curious
though
the
statement
may
appear
to
some
this
preservation
of
older
manners
and
traditions
does
not
seem
to
be
due
so
much
to
geographical
isolation
as
to
subtle
forces
so
strange
and
mysterious
that
to
know
them
they
must
be
felt
and
their
nature
can
only
be
suggested
for
it
can
not
be
described
over
erin
and
armorica
as
over
egypt
there
hovers
a
halo
of
romance
of
strangeness
of
mysticism
real
and
positive
and
if
we
mistake
not
the
language
of
others
these
phrases
of
ours
but
echo
opinions
common
to
many
celts
native
of
the
two
countries
they
who
have
the
first
right
to
testify
and
not
only
are
there
poets
and
seers
among
them
but
men
of
the
practical
world
as
well
and
men
of
high
rank
in
scholarship
in
literature
in
art
and
even
in
science
in
ireland
if
anyone
would
know
ireland
and
test
these
influences
influences
which
have
been
so
fundamental
in
giving
to
the
of
the
past
something
more
than
mere
beauty
of
romance
and
attractive
form
and
something
which
even
as
in
the
heroic
ages
is
and
in
the
centres
where
men
of
the
say
that
they
see
fairies
in
that
strange
state
of
subjectivity
which
the
peasant
calls
fairyland
let
him
stand
on
the
hill
of
tara
silently
and
alone
at
sunset
in
the
noonday
in
the
mist
of
a
dark
day
let
him
likewise
silently
and
alone
follow
the
course
of
the
boyne
let
him
enter
the
silence
of
new
grange
and
of
dowth
let
him
muse
over
the
hieroglyphics
of
lough
crew
let
him
feel
the
mystic
beauty
of
killarney
the
peacefulness
of
glendalough
of
monasterboise
of
clonmacnois
and
the
isolation
of
aranmore
let
him
dare
to
enter
the
rings
of
fairies
to
tempt
the
folk
at
their
and
let
him
rest
on
the
ancient
cairn
above
the
of
finvara
and
look
out
across
the
battlefields
of
moytura
let
him
wander
amid
the
fairy
dells
of
gentle
connemara
let
him
behold
the
irish
sea
from
the
heights
of
howth
as
fionn
mac
cumhail
used
to
do
let
him
listen
to
the
amid
dun
aengus
let
him
view
the
stronghold
of
cuchulainn
and
the
red
branch
knights
let
him
linger
beside
that
mysterious
lake
which
lies
embosomed
between
two
prehistoric
cairns
on
the
summit
of
enchanted
slieve
gullion
where
yet
dwells
invisible
the
guardian
a
fairy
woman
let
him
then
try
to
interpret
the
mysticism
of
an
ancient
irish
myth
in
order
to
understand
why
men
have
been
told
that
in
the
plain
beneath
this
magic
mountain
of
ireland
mighty
warfare
was
once
waged
on
account
of
a
bull
by
the
hosts
of
queen
meave
against
those
of
cuchulainn
the
hero
of
ulster
let
him
be
lost
in
the
mists
on
the
top
of
ben
bulbin
let
him
know
the
haunts
of
fairy
kings
and
queens
in
roscommon
let
him
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
patrick
and
bridgit
and
columba
when
there
are
dark
days
and
stormy
nights
let
him
sit
beside
a
blazing
fire
of
fragrant
peat
in
a
peasant
cottage
listening
to
tales
of
ireland
golden
age
tales
of
gods
of
heroes
of
ghosts
and
of
if
he
will
do
these
things
he
will
know
ireland
and
why
its
people
believe
in
fairies
as
yet
little
has
been
said
concerning
the
effects
of
clouds
of
natural
scenery
of
weird
and
sudden
transformations
in
earth
and
sky
and
air
which
play
their
part
in
shaping
the
complete
of
the
irish
but
what
we
are
about
to
say
concerning
scotland
will
suggest
the
same
things
for
ireland
because
the
nature
of
the
landscape
and
the
atmospheric
changes
are
much
the
same
in
the
two
countries
both
inland
and
on
their
and
shores
in
scotland
in
the
moorlands
between
trossachs
and
aberfoyle
a
region
made
famous
by
scott
i
have
seen
atmospheric
changes
so
sudden
and
so
contrasted
as
to
appear
marvellous
what
shifting
of
vapours
and
clouds
what
flashes
of
bright
then
twilight
at
midday
across
the
landscape
shadows
of
black
dense
rush
like
shadows
of
flocks
of
great
birds
which
darken
all
the
earth
palpitating
wrap
themselves
around
the
and
then
come
down
like
living
things
to
move
across
the
valleys
sometimes
only
a
few
yards
above
the
traveller
head
and
in
that
country
live
terrible
when
black
clouds
discharge
their
watery
burden
it
is
in
vertical
through
which
the
world
appears
as
through
an
perhaps
in
a
single
day
there
may
be
the
bluest
of
heavens
and
the
clearest
air
the
densest
clouds
and
the
darkest
shadows
the
calm
of
the
morning
and
the
wind
of
the
tempest
at
night
in
aberfoyle
after
such
a
day
i
witnessed
a
clear
sunset
and
a
fair
evening
sky
in
the
morning
when
i
arose
the
lowlands
along
the
river
were
inundated
and
a
thousand
cascades
large
and
small
were
leaping
down
the
and
rain
was
falling
in
heavy
masses
within
an
hour
afterwards
as
i
travelled
on
towards
stirling
the
rain
and
wind
ceased
and
there
settled
down
over
all
the
land
so
that
they
seemed
like
the
fancies
of
some
horrible
dream
then
like
massed
armies
they
began
to
move
to
their
and
stood
there
while
from
the
east
came
perfect
weather
and
a
flood
of
brilliant
sunshine
and
in
the
highlands
from
stirling
to
inverness
what
magic
what
changing
colours
and
shadows
there
were
on
the
treeless
hills
and
in
the
valleys
with
their
clear
pure
streams
receiving
tribute
from
unnumbered
little
rills
and
springs
some
dropping
water
drop
by
drop
as
though
it
were
and
everywhere
the
heather
giving
to
the
a
hue
of
rich
and
to
the
air
an
odour
of
aromatic
fragrance
on
to
the
beyond
inverness
there
is
the
same
kind
of
a
treeless
highland
country
and
then
after
a
few
hours
of
travel
one
looks
out
across
the
water
from
kyle
and
beholds
skye
where
cuchulainn
is
by
some
believed
to
have
passed
his
young
manhood
learning
feats
of
arms
from
fairy
women
skye
dark
mountainous
majestic
with
its
waterfalls
turning
to
white
spray
as
they
tumble
from
cliff
to
cliff
into
the
sound
from
out
the
clouds
that
hide
their
sources
in
the
outer
hebrides
as
in
the
aranmore
islands
off
west
ireland
influences
are
at
work
on
the
celtic
imagination
quite
different
from
those
in
skye
and
its
neighbouring
islands
mountainous
billows
which
have
travelled
from
afar
out
of
the
mysterious
watery
waste
find
their
first
impediment
on
the
west
of
these
isolated
hebridean
isles
and
they
fling
themselves
like
mad
things
in
full
fury
against
the
wild
rocky
islets
fringing
the
coast
white
spray
flashes
in
unearthly
forms
over
the
highest
cliff
and
the
unrestrained
hurricane
whirls
it
far
inland
ocean
eternally
murmuring
sounds
set
up
a
responsive
vibration
in
the
soul
of
the
peasant
as
he
in
solitude
drives
home
his
flocks
amid
the
weird
gloaming
at
the
end
of
a
december
day
and
later
when
he
sits
brooding
in
his
humble
cottage
at
night
in
the
fitful
flickering
of
a
peat
fire
he
has
a
mystic
consciousness
that
deep
down
in
his
being
there
is
a
more
divine
music
compared
with
which
that
of
external
nature
is
but
a
symbol
and
an
echo
and
as
he
stirs
the
glowing
phantoms
from
an
irretrievable
past
seem
to
be
sitting
with
him
on
the
edge
of
the
of
dying
light
maybe
there
are
huntsmen
of
the
sea
and
land
with
spears
and
knives
of
bone
and
flint
and
shaggy
sleeping
dogs
or
fearless
resting
wearily
on
shields
of
brilliant
bronze
or
maybe
celtic
warriors
fierce
and
bold
and
then
he
understands
that
his
past
and
his
present
are
one
commonly
there
is
the
thickest
when
the
driving
storms
come
in
from
the
atlantic
or
when
dense
fog
covers
sea
and
land
and
again
there
are
melancholy
moaning
across
from
shore
to
shore
bending
the
bushes
of
the
purple
heather
at
other
times
there
is
a
sparkle
of
the
brightest
sunshine
on
the
ocean
waves
a
fierceness
foreign
to
the
more
peaceful
highlands
and
then
again
a
dead
silence
prevails
at
sunrise
and
at
sunset
if
one
be
on
the
mountains
or
if
on
the
shore
no
sound
is
heard
save
the
rhythmical
beat
of
the
waves
and
now
and
then
the
hoarse
cry
of
a
all
these
contrasted
conditions
may
be
seen
in
one
day
or
each
may
endure
for
a
day
and
the
dark
days
last
nearly
all
the
winter
and
then
it
is
during
the
long
winter
that
the
crofters
and
congregate
night
after
night
in
a
different
neighbour
house
to
tell
about
fairies
and
ghosts
and
to
repeat
all
those
old
legends
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
celt
perhaps
every
one
present
has
heard
the
same
story
or
legend
a
hundred
times
yet
it
is
always
listened
to
and
told
as
though
it
were
the
latest
bulletin
of
some
great
event
over
those
little
islands
so
far
away
to
the
north
out
on
the
edge
of
the
world
in
darkness
settles
down
at
four
or
even
earlier
and
the
islanders
hurry
through
with
their
dinner
of
fish
and
so
as
not
to
miss
hearing
the
first
story
when
the
company
has
gathered
from
far
and
near
pipes
are
and
lit
and
the
peat
is
heaped
up
for
the
is
not
likely
to
end
before
midnight
house
is
roomy
and
clean
if
homely
with
its
bright
peat
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
are
many
present
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
all
the
women
are
seated
and
most
of
the
men
girls
are
crouched
between
the
knees
of
fathers
or
brothers
or
friends
while
boys
are
perched
wherever
they
can
climb
the
houseman
is
twisting
twigs
of
heather
into
ropes
to
hold
down
thatch
a
neighbour
crofter
is
twining
quicken
root
into
cords
to
tie
cows
while
another
is
plaiting
bent
grass
into
baskets
to
hold
meal
the
housewife
is
spinning
a

is
carding
another

is

while
a

supposed
to
be
working
is
away
in

background
conversing
in
low
whispers
with
the
son
of
a
neighbouring
crofter
neighbour
wives
and
neighbour
daughters
are
knitting

or
embroidering
then
when
the
bad
weather
for
fishing
has
been
fully
discussed
by
the
men
and
the
latest
gossip
by
the
women
and
the
foolish
talk
of
the
youths
and
maidens
in
the
corners
is
finished
the
one
who
occupies
the
chair
of
honour
in
the
midst
of
the
looks
around
to
be
sure
that
everybody
is
comfortable
and
ready
and
as
his
first
story
begins
even
the
babes
by
instinct
cease
their
noise
and
crying
and
young
and
old
bend
forward
eagerly
to
hear
every
word
it
does
not
matter
if
some
of
the
boys
and
girls
do
topple
over
asleep
or
even
some
of
the
older
folk
as
the
hour
gets
late
the
tales
meet
no
interruption
in
their
even
unbroken
flow
and
here
we
have
the
most
celtic
and
the
most
natural
environments
which
the
enjoys
in
scotland
there
are
still
the
southern
highlands
in
the
country
around
oban
and
the
islands
near
them
and
of
all
these
isles
none
is
so
picturesque
in
history
as
the
one
columba
loved
so
well
though
iona
enjoys
less
of
the
wildness
of
the
hebrides
furthest
west
it
has
their
and
fogs
and
dark
days
and
their
strangeness
of
isolation
on
it
as
adamnan
tells
us
the
holy
man
fought
with
black
demons
who
came
to
invade
his
monastery
and
saw
angelic
hosts
and
when
the
angels
took
his
soul
at
midnight
in
that
little
chapel
by
the
there
was
a
mystic
light
which
illuminated
all
the
altar
like
the
brightest
sunshine
but
nowadays
where
the
saint
saw
demons
and
angels
the
islanders
see
ghosts
and
people
and
when
one
of
these
islanders
is
taken
in
death
it
is
not
by
angels
it
is
by
fairies
in
the
isle
of
man
in
the
midst
of
the
irish
sea
almost
equidistant
from
ireland
scotland
and
wales
and
concentrating
in
itself
the
psychical
and
magnetic
influences
from
these
three
celtic
lands
and
from
england
too
lies
the
beautiful
kingdom
of
the
great
tuatha
de
danann
god
manannan
mac
lir
or
as
his
loyal
manx
subjects
prefer
to
call
him
in
no
other
land
of
the
celt
does
nature
show
so
many
moods
and
contrasts
such
perfect
repose
at
one
time
and
at
another
time
the
mightiness
of
its
unloosed
powers
when
the
baffled
sea
throws
itself
angrily
against
a
high
coast
as
wild
and
almost
as
as
the
western
coasts
of
ireland
and
the
hebrides
but
it
is
nature
calmer
moods
which
have
greater
effect
upon
the
manx
people
on
the
summit
of
his
ancient
stronghold
south
barrule
mountain
the
god
manannan
yet
dwells
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
and
whenever
on
a
warm
day
he
throws
off
his
magic
with
which
he
is
wont
to
cover
the
whole
island
the
golden
gorse
or
purple
heather
blossoms
become
musical
with
the
hum
of
bees
and
sway
gently
on
breezes
made
balmy
by
the
tropical
warmth
of
an
ocean
stream
flowing
from
the
far
distant
mexican
shores
of
a
new
world
then
in
many
a
moist
and
glen
pure
and
verdant
in
rejoicing
bands
add
to
the
harmony
of
sound
as
they
gather
on
the
field
or
dip
themselves
in
the
clear
water
of
the
tinkling
brook
and
from
the
cliffs
and
rocky
islets
on
the
coast
comes
the
echo
of
the
multitudinous
chorus
of
at
sunset
on
such
a
day
as
evening
calmness
settles
down
weird
mountain
shadows
begin
to
move
across
the
glens
and
when
darkness
has
fallen
there
is
a
mystic
stillness
broken
only
by
the
ceaseless
throbbing
of
the
the
flow
of
brooks
and
the
voices
of
the
night
in
the
moorland
solitudes
even
by
day
there
sometimes
broods
a
deeper
silence
which
is
yet
more
potent
and
full
of
meaning
for
the
peasant
as
under
its
spell
he
beholds
the
peaceful
vision
happy
and
sunlit
of
sea
and
land
of
gentle
mountains
falling
away
in
into
plains
and
fertile
valleys
and
he
comes
to
feel
instinctively
the
old
druidic
fires
relit
within
his
heart
and
perhaps
unconsciously
he
worships
there
in
nature
temple
the
natural
beauty
without
awakens
the
divine
beauty
within
and
for
a
second
of
time
he
out
of
his
subconsciousness
is
conscious
that
in
nature
there
are
beings
and
inaudible
voices
which
have
no
existence
for
the
flippant
crowds
who
come
and
go
to
the
multitude
his
ancestral
beliefs
are
foolishness
his
fairies
but
the
creatures
of
a
fervid
celtic
imagination
which
readily
responds
to
unusual
phenomena
and
environments
they
will
not
believe
with
him
that
all
beauty
and
harmony
in
the
world
are
but
symbolic
and
that
behind
these
stand
unseen
sustaining
forces
and
powers
which
are
conscious
and
eternal
and
though
by
instinct
they
willingly
personify
nature
they
do
not
know
the
secret
of
why
they
do
so
for
them
the
outer
is
reality
the
inner
from
the
age
of
stone
to
the
civilized
era
of
the
isle
of
man
has
been
in
succession
the
home
of
every
known
race
and
people
who
have
flourished
in
western
europe
and
though
subject
in
turn
to
the
irish
gael
and
to
the
welsh
brython
to
northmen
and
to
danes
to
scots
and
to
english
and
the
scene
of
sweeping
transformations
in
religion
as
pagan
cults
succeeded
one
another
to
give
way
to
the
teaching
of
patrick
and
his
disciples
german
and
maughold
and
this
finally
to
the
protestant
form
of
christianity
the
island
alone
of
celtic
lands
has
been
strangely
empowered
to
maintain
in
almost
primitive
purity
its
ancient
constitution
and
freedom
and
though
geographically
at
the
very
centre
of
the
united
kingdom
is
not
a
part
of
it
the
archaeologist
may
still
read
in
mysterious
symbols
of
stone
and
earth
as
they
lie
strewn
over
the
island
surface
the
history
of
this
panoramic
procession
of
human
evolution
while
through
these
same
symbols
the
manx
seer
reads
a
deeper
meaning
and
sometimes
in
the
superhuman
realm
of
radiant
light
to
which
since
long
ago
they
have
oft
come
and
oft
returned
he
meets
face
to
face
the
gods
and
heroes
whose
early
tombs
stand
solitary
on
the
and
moorland
or
hidden
away
in
the
embrace
of
wild
flowers
and
verdure
amid
valleys
and
in
the
darker
he
sees
innumerable
ghosts
of
many
of
these
races
which
have
perished
in
wales
less
can
be
said
of
wales
than
of
ireland
or
of
scotland
as
a
whole
it
has
it
is
true
its
own
peculiar
psychic
atmosphere
different
no
doubt
because
its
people
are
brythonic
celts
rather
than
gaelic
celts
but
wales
with
conditions
more
modernized
than
is
the
case
in
ireland
or
in
the
western
hebrides
of
scotland
does
not
now
exhibit
in
a
vigorous
or
flourishing
state
those
celtic
influences
which
when
they
were
active
did
so
much
to
create
the
precious
romances
of
arthur
and
his
brotherhood
and
to
lay
the
foundations
for
the
welsh
belief
in
the
a
fairy
race
still
surviving
in
a
few
favoured
localities
wales
like
all
celtic
countries
is
a
land
of
long
though
there
seems
to
be
save
in
the
mountains
of
the
north
less
of
mist
and
darkness
and
cloud
effects
than
in
ireland
and
scotland
in
the
south
perhaps
the
most
curious
influences
are
to
be
felt
at
david
head
and
in
david
itself
once
the
goal
for
thousands
of
pilgrims
from
many
countries
of
mediaeval
europe
and
probably
in
pagan
times
the
seat
of
an
oracle
and
a
place
of
like
character
is
the
peninsula
of
gower
south
of
swansea
caerphilly
castle
where
the
green
lady
reigns
now
amid
its
ruined
acres
is
a
strange
place
and
so
is
the
hill
near
carmarthen
where
merlin
is
asleep
in
a
cave
with
the
vivian
but
in
none
of
these
places
is
there
a
strong
living
faith
in
fairies
as
there
is
for
example
in
west
ireland
the
one
region
where
i
found
a
real
celtic
atmosphere
and
it
is
a
region
where
everybody
speaks
welsh
is
a
mountainous
country
rarely
visited
by
travellers
save
archaeologists
a
few
miles
from
newport
and
its
centre
is
the
pentre
evan
cromlech
the
finest
cromlech
in
wales
if
not
in
britain
by
this
prehistoric
monument
and
in
the
country
round
the
old
nevern
church
three
miles
away
there
is
an
active
belief
in
the
in
ghosts
in
in
and
and
in
witchcraft
and
black
magic
thence
on
to
and
its
valley
where
many
of
the
mabinogion
stories
took
form
or
at
least
from
where
they
drew
rich
material
in
the
way
of
are
environments
purely
welsh
and
as
yet
little
disturbed
by
the
commercial
materialism
of
the
age
there
remain
now
to
be
mentioned
three
other
places
in
wales
to
me
very
impressive
psychically
these
are
ancient
harlech
so
famous
in
recorded
welsh
harlech
with
its
strange
and
old
castle
from
which
the
snowdon
range
is
seen
to
loom
majestically
and
clear
and
with
its
bay
mount
snowdon
with
its
memories
of
arthur
and
welsh
heroes
and
sacred
anglesey
or
mona
strewn
with
tumuli
and
dolmens
and
mona
where
the
druids
made
their
last
stand
against
the
roman
eagles
and
its
little
island
called
holyhead
facing
ireland
however
when
all
is
said
modern
wales
is
poorer
in
its
fairy
atmosphere
than
modern
ireland
or
modern
brittany
certainly
there
is
a
good
deal
of
this
fairy
atmosphere
yet
though
it
has
become
less
vital
than
the
similar
fairy
atmosphere
in
the
great
centres
of
erin
and
armorica
but
the
purely
social
environment
under
which
the
of
wales
survives
is
a
potent
force
which
promises
to
preserve
underneath
the
surface
of
welsh
national
life
where
the
commercialism
of
the
age
has
compelled
it
to
retire
in
a
state
of
temporary
latency
the
ancestral
idealism
of
the
ancient
brythonic
race
in
wales
as
in
lower
brittany
and
in
parts
of
ireland
and
the
hebrides
one
may
still
hear
in
common
daily
use
a
language
which
has
been
continuously
spoken
since
unknown
centuries
before
the
rise
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
strong
hold
which
the
druidic
an
annual
national
congress
of
bards
and
literati
continues
to
have
upon
the
welsh
people
in
spite
of
their
commercialism
is
again
a
sign
that
their
hearts
remain
uncorrupted
that
when
the
more
favourable
hour
strikes
they
will
sweep
aside
the
deadening
influences
which
now
hold
them
in
spiritual
bondage
and
become
as
they
were
in
the
past
true
children
of
arthur
in
cornwall
strikingly
like
brittany
in
physical
aspects
southern
and
western
cornwall
is
a
land
of
the
sea
of
rolling
plains
and
moorlands
rather
than
of
high
hills
and
mountains
a
land
of
where
noisy
crowds
of
black
crows
and
white
mingle
together
over
the
or
fields
and
where
in
the
the
call
of
the
cuckoo
is
heard
with
the
song
of
the
skylark
like
the
isle
of
man
from
the
earliest
ages
cornwall
has
been
a
and
a
for
contending
races
the
primitive
dark
iberian
peoples
gave
way
before
invaders
and
these
to
roman
and
then
to
germanic
invaders
nature
has
been
kind
to
the
whole
of
cornwall
but
chiefly
upon
the
peninsula
whose
ancient
capital
is
penzance
which
possibly
means
holy
headland
and
upon
the
land
immediately
eastward
and
northward
of
it
she
has
bestowed
her
rarest
gifts
holding
this
territory
embosomed
in
the
pure
waters
of
ocean
and
breathing
over
it
the
pure
air
of
the
atlantic
in
spring
and
in
summer
calm
when
the
warm
vapours
from
the
gulf
stream
sweep
over
it
freely
and
make
it
a
land
of
flowers
and
of
nature
preserves
eternally
its
beauty
and
its
sanctity
there
are
there
ruined
british
villages
whose
builders
are
long
forgotten
strange
prehistoric
circular
like
fortresses
crowning
the
mysterious
underground
and
crosses
probably
everywhere
are
the
records
of
the
mighty
past
of
this
druid
land
of
sunset
there
are
weird
legends
of
the
lost
kingdom
of
fair
lyonesse
which
seers
sometimes
see
beneath
the
clear
salt
waves
with
all
its
ancient
towns
and
flowery
fields
legends
of
phoenicians
and
oriental
merchants
who
came
for
tin
legends
of
gods
and
of
giants
of
pixies
and
of
fairies
of
king
arthur
in
his
castle
at
tintagel
of
angels
and
of
saints
of
witches
and
of
wizards
on
dedicated
to
the
sun
pagan
priests
and
priestesses
kept
kindled
the
eternal
fire
and
daily
watched
eastward
for
the
rising
of
the
god
of
light
and
life
to
greet
his
coming
with
paeans
of
thanksgiving
and
praise
then
after
the
sixth
century
the
new
religion
had
come
proclaiming
a
more
mystic
light
of
the
world
in
the
son
of
god
and
to
the
pious
monks
who
succeeded
the
druids
the
archangel
michael
appeared
in
vision
on
the
sacred
mount
and
before
augustine
came
to
britain
the
celts
of
cornwall
had
already
combined
in
their
own
mystical
way
the
spiritual
message
of
primitive
christianity
with
the
pure
of
their
ancestors
and
their
land
was
then
as
it
most
likely
had
been
in
pagan
days
a
centre
of
pilgrimages
for
their
celtic
kinsmen
from
ireland
from
wales
from
england
and
from
brittany
when
in
later
times
new
theological
doctrines
were
superimposed
on
this
mysticism
of
celtic
christianity
the
sacred
fires
were
buried
in
ashes
and
the
light
and
beauty
of
the
pagan
world
obscured
with
sackcloth
but
there
in
that
most
southern
and
western
corner
of
the
isle
of
britain
the
sacred
fires
themselves
still
burn
on
the
divine
though
smothered
in
the
hearts
of
its
children
the
cornishman
vision
is
no
longer
clear
he
looks
upon
cromlech
and
dolmen
upon
ancient
caves
of
initiation
and
upon
the
graves
of
his
prehistoric
ancestors
and
vaguely
feels
but
does
not
know
why
his
land
is
so
holy
is
so
permeated
by
an
indefinable
magic
for
he
has
lost
his
ancestral
mystic
touch
with
the
unseen
he
is
and
the
hand
of
the
conqueror
has
fallen
more
heavily
upon
the
people
of
cornwall
than
upon
any
other
celtic
people
and
now
for
a
time
but
let
us
hope
happily
only
for
this
dark
period
of
transition
they
sleep
until
arthur
comes
to
break
the
spell
and
set
them
free
in
brittany
as
was
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
ireland
and
brittany
are
to
be
regarded
as
the
two
poles
of
the
modern
celtic
world
but
it
is
believed
by
celtic
mystics
that
they
are
much
more
than
this
that
they
are
two
of
its
psychic
centres
with
tara
and
carnac
as
two
respective
points
of
focus
from
which
the
celtic
influence
of
each
country
radiates
with
such
a
psychical
point
of
view
it
makes
no
difference
at
all
whether
one
scholar
argues
carnac
to
be
celtic
and
another
for
if
as
it
most
likely
is
it
has
certainly
been
bequeathed
to
the
people
who
were
and
are
celtic
and
its
influence
has
been
an
unbroken
thing
from
times
altogether
beyond
the
horizon
of
history
according
to
this
theory
and
in
following
it
we
are
merely
trying
to
put
on
record
unique
material
transmitted
to
us
by
the
most
learned
of
contemporary
celtic
mystics
and
seers
there
seem
to
be
certain
favoured
places
on
the
earth
where
its
magnetic
and
even
more
subtle
forces
are
most
powerful
and
most
easily
felt
by
persons
susceptible
to
such
things
and
carnac
appears
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
of
such
places
in
europe
and
for
this
reason
as
has
been
thought
was
probably
selected
by
its
ancient
as
the
great
centre
for
religious
practices
for
the
celebration
of
pagan
mysteries
for
tribal
assemblies
for
astronomical
observations
and
very
likely
for
establishing
schools
in
which
to
educate
neophytes
for
the
priesthood
tara
with
its
tributary
boyne
valley
is
a
similar
place
in
ireland
so
selected
and
so
used
as
in
our
study
of
the
cult
of
fairies
and
the
cult
of
the
dead
manuscript
evidence
will
later
indicate
and
thus
to
such
psychical
and
magnetic
or
according
perhaps
to
others
religious
or
traditional
influences
as
focus
themselves
at
tara
and
carnac
though
in
other
parts
of
the
two
countries
as
well
may
be
due
in
a
great
even
in
an
essential
measure
the
vigorous
and
of
ireland
and
the
innate
and
belief
of
the
breton
people
in
the
legend
of
the
dead
and
in
a
world
invisible
for
fairies
and
souls
of
the
dead
though
strictly
speaking
not
confused
are
believed
to
be
beings
of
the
subjective
world
existing
and
influencing
mortals
as
they
have
always
existed
and
influenced
them
according
to
ancient
and
modern
traditions
and
as
they
appear
now
in
the
eyes
even
of
science
through
the
work
of
a
few
pioneer
scientists
in
psychical
research
and
it
seems
probable
that
subjective
beings
of
this
kind
granting
their
existence
were
made
use
of
by
the
ancient
druids
and
even
by
patrick
when
the
old
and
new
religions
met
to
do
battle
on
the
hill
of
tara
the
control
of
tara

a
psychical
centre

the
psychical
control
of
all

it

and

a
learned
priest
of
the
roman
church
told
me
when
i
met
him
in
galway
that
in
his
opinion
those
places
in
ireland
where
ancient
sacrifices
were
performed
to
pagan
or
druid
gods
are
still
unless
they
have
been
regularly
exorcized
under
the
control
of
demons
daemons
and
what
the
druids
were
at
tara
and
throughout
erin
and
most
probably
at
carnac
as
well
the
priests
were
in
egypt

the
pythonesses
in
greece

various
possible
plans
have
presented
themselves
for
setting
forth
the
living
as
i
have
found
it
during
my
travels
in
the
six
celtic
countries
among
the
people
who
hold
it
to
take
a
bit
here
and
a
bit
there
from
a
miscellaneous
group
of
psychological
experiences
fairy
legends
and
stories
which
are
linked
together
almost
inseparably
in
the
mind
of
the
one
who
tells
them
does
not
seem
at
all
satisfactory
nor
even
just
in
trying
to
arrive
at
a
correct
result
classification
under
various
headings
such
for
example
as
fairy
abductions
changelings
or
appearances
of
fairies
seems
equally
unsatisfactory
for
as
soon
as
the
details
of
such
as
i
am
presenting
are
isolated
from
one
another
even
though
brought
together
in
related
groups
they
must
be
rudely
torn
out
of
their
true
and
natural
environment
and
divorced
from
the
psychological
atmosphere
amidst
which
they
were
first
presented
by
the
narrator
the
same
objection
applies
to
any
plan
of
dividing
the
evidence
into
that
which
is
purely
legendary
that
which
is
or
evidence
from
people
who
claim
to
have
seen
fairies
or
to
have
been
in
fairyland
or
under
fairy
influences
and
that
which
is
evidence
from
actual
percipients
these
three
classes
of
evidence
are
so
that
every
reader
will
be
able
to
distinguish
each
class
for
himself
as
it
occurs
and
a
mechanical
classification
by
us
is
unnecessary
so
no
plan
seems
so
good
as
the
plan
i
have
adopted
of
permitting
all
witnesses
to
give
their
own
testimony
in
their
own
way
and
in
its
native
setting
and
then
of
classifying
and
weighing
such
testimony
according
to
the
methods
of
comparative
religion
and
the
anthropological
sciences
in
most
cases
as
examination
will
show
the
evidence
is
so
clear
that
little
or
no
comment
is
necessary
most
of
the
evidence
also
points
so
much
in
one
direction
that
the
only
verdict
which
seems
reasonable
is
that
the
belongs
to
a
doctrine
of
souls
that
is
to
say
that
fairyland
is
a
state
or
condition
realm
or
place
very
much
like
if
not
the
same
as
that
wherein
civilized
and
uncivilized
men
alike
place
the
souls
of
the
dead
in
company
with
other
invisible
beings
such
as
gods
daemons
and
all
sorts
of
good
and
bad
spirits
not
only
do
both
educated
and
uneducated
celtic
seers
so
conceive
fairyland
but
they
go
much
further
and
say
that
fairyland
actually
exists
as
an
invisible
world
within
which
the
visible
world
is
immersed
like
an
island
in
an
unexplored
ocean
and
that
it
is
peopled
by
more
species
of
living
beings
than
this
world
because
incomparably
more
vast
and
varied
in
its
possibilities
we
should
be
prepared
in
hearing
the
evidence
to
meet
with
some
contradictions
and
a
good
deal
of
confusion
for
many
of
the
people
who
believe
in
such
a
strange
world
as
we
have
just
described
and
who
think
they
sometimes
have
entered
it
or
have
seen
some
of
its
inhabitants
have
often
had
no
training
at
all
in
schools
or
colleges
but
when
we
hear
legendary
tales
which
have
never
been
recorded
save
in
the
minds
of
unnumbered
generations
of
men
we
ought
not
on
that
account
to
undervalue
them
for
often
they
are
better
authorities
and
more
trustworthy
than
many
an
ancient
and
carefully
inscribed
manuscript
in
the
british
museum
and
they
are
probably
far
older
than
the
oldest
book
in
the
world
let
us
then
for
a
time
forget
that
there
are
such
things
as
libraries
and
universities
and
betake
ourselves
to
the
celtic
peasant
for
instruction
living
close
to
nature
as
he
lives
and
thinking
the
things
which
he
thinks
but
the
peasant
will
not
be
our
only
teacher
for
we
shall
also
hear
much
of
first
importance
from
city
folk
of
the
highest
intellectual
training
it
has
become
perhaps
always
has
been
in
modern
times
a
widespread
opinion
even
among
some
scholars
that
the
belief
in
fairies
is
the
property
solely
of
simple
uneducated
and
that
people
who
have
had
touch
of
education
and
a
little
common
sense
knocked
into
their
heads
to
use
the
ordinary
language
be
caught
believing
in
such
nonsense
this
same
class
of
critics
used
to
make
similar
remarks
about
people
who
said
there
were
ghosts
until
the
truth
of
another
superstition
was
discovered
by
psychical
research
so
in
this
chapter
we
hope
to
correct
this
erroneous
opinion
about
the
an
opinion
chiefly
entertained
by
scholars
and
others
who
know
not
the
first
real
fact
about
fairies
because
they
have
never
lived
amongst
the
people
who
believe
in
fairies
but
derive
all
their
information
from
books
and
hearsay
in
due
order
the
proper
sort
of
witnesses
will
substantiate
this
position
but
before
coming
to
their
testimony
we
may
now
say
that
there
are
men
and
women
in
dublin
in
other
parts
of
ireland
in
scotland
in
the
isle
of
man
and
in
brythonic
lands
too
whom
all
the
world
knows
as
educated
leaders
in
their
respective
fields
of
activity
who
not
only
declare
their
belief
that
fairies
were
but
that
fairies
are
and
some
of
these
men
and
women
say
that
they
have
the
power
to
see
fairies
as
real
spiritual
beings
in
the
evidence
about
to
be
presented
there
has
been
no
selecting
in
favour
of
any
one
theory
it
is
presented
as
discovered
the
only
liberty
taken
with
some
of
the
evidence
has
been
to
put
it
into
better
grammatical
form
and
sometimes
to
recast
an
ambiguous
statement
when
i
as
collector
had
in
my
own
mind
no
doubt
as
to
its
meaning
translations
have
been
made
as
literal
as
possible
though
sometimes
it
has
been
found
better
to
offer
the
meaning
rather
than
what
in
english
would
be
an
obscure
colloquialism
or
idiomatic
expression
the
method
pursued
in
seeking
the
evidence
has
been
to
penetrate
as
deeply
and
in
as
natural
a
way
as
possible
the
thoughts
of
the
people
who
believe
in
fairies
and
like
beings
by
living
among
them
and
observing
their
customs
and
ways
of
thought
and
recording
what
seemed
relevant
to
the
subject
under
investigation
chance
expressions
and
legends
told
under
various
ordinary
conditions
rather
than
to
collect
long
legends
or
literary
for
these
last
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
many
excellent
works
on
celtic
we
have
sought
to
bring
together
as
perhaps
has
not
been
done
before
the
philosophy
of
the
belief
in
fairies
rather
than
the
mere
itself
though
the
two
can
not
be
separated
in
giving
the
evidence
concerning
fairies
we
sometimes
give
evidence
which
though
akin
to
it
and
thus
worthy
of
record
is
not
strictly
all
that
we
have
omitted
from
the
materials
in
the
form
first
taken
down
are
stories
and
accounts
of
things
not
sufficiently
related
to
the
world
of
faerie
to
be
of
value
here
in
no
case
has
testimony
been
admitted
from
a
person
who
was
known
to
be
unreliable
nor
even
from
a
person
who
was
thought
to
be
unreliable
accordingly
the
evidence
we
are
to
examine
ought
to
be
considered
good
evidence
so
far
as
it
goes
and
since
it
represents
almost
all
known
elements
of
the
and
contains
almost
all
the
essential
elements
upon
which
the
advocates
of
the
naturalistic
theory
of
the
pygmy
theory
of
the
druid
theory
of
the
mythological
theory
as
well
as
of
our
own
psychological
theory
must
base
their
arguments
we
consider
it
very
adequate
evidence
nearly
every
witness
is
a
celt
who
has
been
made
acquainted
with
the
belief
in
fairies
through
direct
contact
with
people
who
believe
in
them
or
through
having
heard
among
his
own
kindred
or
through
personal
psychological
experiences
and
it
is
exceedingly
fortunate
for
us
that
an
unusually
large
proportion
of
these
celtic
witnesses
are
actual
percipients
and
natural
seers
because
the
eliminations
from
the
to
be
brought
about
in
chapter
iii
by
means
of
an
anthropological
analysis
of
evidence
will
be
so
extensive
that
scientifically
and
strictly
speaking
there
will
remain
as
a
residual
or
unknown
quantity
upon
which
our
final
conclusion
must
depend
solely
the
testimony
of
reliable
that
is
to
say
no
method
of
anthropological
dissection
of
the
evidence
can
force
aside
consideration
of
the
ultimate
truth
which
may
or
may
not
reside
in
the
testimony
of
sane
and
thoroughly
reliable
old
and
young
educated
and
uneducated
peasant
and
testify
to
the
actual
existence
of
the
celtic
and
the
evidence
from
roman
catholics
stands
beside
that
from
protestants
the
evidence
of
priests
supports
that
of
scholars
and
scientists
peasant
seers
have
testified
to
the
same
kind
of
visions
as
highly
educated
seers
and
what
poets
have
said
agrees
with
what
is
told
by
business
men
engineers
and
lawyers
but
the
best
of
witnesses
like
ourselves
are
only
human
and
subject
to
the
shortcomings
of
the
ordinary
man
and
therefore
no
claim
can
be
made
in
any
case
to
infallibility
of
evidence
all
the
world
over
men
interpret
visions
pragmatically
and
sociologically
or
hold
beliefs
in
accord
with
their
own
personal
experiences
and
are
for
ever
unconsciously
immersed
in
a
sea
of
psychological
influences
which
sometimes
may
be
explainable
through
the
methods
of
sociological
inquiry
sometimes
may
be
supernormal
in
origin
and
nature
and
hence
to
be
explained
most
adequately
if
at
all
through
psychical
research
our
study
is
a
study
of
human
nature
itself
and
moreover
often
of
human
nature
in
its
most
subtle
aspects
which
are
called
psychical
and
the
most
difficult
problem
of
all
is
for
human
nature
to
interpret
and
understand
its
own
ultimate
essence
and
psychological
instincts
our
whole
aim
is
to
discover
what
reasonableness
may
or
may
not
stand
behind
a
belief
so
vast
so
ancient
so
common
contrary
to
popular
opinion
to
all
classes
of
celts
and
so
fundamental
a
shaping
force
in
european
history
religion
and
social
institutions
when
we
state
our
conviction
that
the
is
common
to
all
classes
of
celts
we
do
not
state
that
it
is
common
to
all
celts
the
materialization
of
the
age
has
affected
the
as
it
has
affected
all
religious
beliefs
the
world
over
this
has
been
pointed
out
by
hyde
by
carmichael
and
by
jenner
in
their
respective
introductions
for
ireland
scotland
and
cornwall
nevertheless
the
as
the
of
the
celtic
peoples
is
still
able
to
count
its
adherents
by
hundreds
of
thousands
even
in
many
cases
where
christian
theology
has
been
partially
or
wholly
discarded
by
educated
celts
in
the
country
or
in
the
city
as
being
to
them
in
too
many
details
out
of
harmony
with
accepted
scientific
truths
the
belief
in
fairies
has
been
jealously
retained
and
will
so
it
would
seem
be
retained
in
the
future
we
are
now
prepared
to
hear
about
the
the
people
as
the
irish
call
their
race
about
the
of
peace
the
or
the
moving
folk
as
the
scotch
call
their
who
live
in
green
knolls
and
in
the
mountain
fastnesses
of
the
highlands
about
various
manx
fairies
about
the
the
or
as
the
welsh
people
call
their
fairies
about
cornish
pixies
and
about
fairies
and
the
phantoms
of
the
dead
in
brittany
and
along
with
these
for
they
are
very
much
akin
let
us
hear
about
ghosts
sometimes
about
ghosts
who
discover
hidden
treasure
as
in
our
story
of
the
about
goblins
about
various
sorts
of
generally
coming
from
apparitions
of
the
dead
or
from
banshees
about
and
about
leprechauns
about
hosts
of
the
air
and
all
kinds
of
elementals
and
spirits
in
short
about
all
the
orders
of
beings
who
mingle
together
in
that
invisible
realm
called
fairyland

introduction
by
douglas
hyde
d
craoibhín
president
of
the
gaelic
league
author
of
literary
history
of
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
conclusions
drawn
by
wentz
from
his
explorations
into
the
irish
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
data
from
which
he
draws
them
i
have
myself
been
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
collecting
off
and
on
the
of
western
ireland
not
indeed
in
the
shape
in
which
wentz
has
collected
it
but
rather
with
an
eye
partly
for
linguistic
and
literary
purposes
to
its
songs
sayings
ballads
proverbs
and
which
last
are
generally
the
equivalent
of
the
german
märchen
but
sometimes
have
a
touch
of
the
saga
nature
about
them
in
making
a
collection
of
these
things
i
have
naturally
come
across
a
very
large
amount
of
conversationally
expressed
with
regard
to
the
and
other
supernatural
manifestations
so
that
i
can
bear
witness
to
the
fidelity
with
which
wentz
has
done
his
work
on
irish
soil
for
to
a
great
number
of
the
beliefs
which
he
records
i
have
myself
heard
parallels
sometimes
i
have
heard
near
variants
of
the
stories
sometimes
the
identical
stories
so
we
may
i
think
unhesitatingly
accept
his
whatever
as
i
said
be
the
conclusions
we
may
deduce
from
them
the
or
märchen
which
i
have
spent
so
much
time
in
collecting
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
which
forms
the
basis
of
wentz
studies
the
or
story
is
something
much
more
intricate
complicated
and
than
the
belief
one
can
quite
easily
distinguish
between
the
two
one
the
belief
is
short
conversational
chiefly
relating
to
real
people
and
contains
no
great
sequence
of
incidents
while
the
other
the
is
long
complicated
more
or
less
conventional
and
above
all
has
its
interest
grouped
around
a
single
central
figure
that
of
the
hero
or
heroine
i
may
make
this
plainer
by
an
example
let
us
go
into
a
cottage
on
the
as
wentz
and
i
have
done
so
often
and
ask
the
old
man
of
the
house
if
he
ever
heard
of
such
things
as
fairies
and
he
will
tell
you
that
is
fairies
in
it
surely
did
his
own
father
see
the
forth
beyond
full
of
them
and
he
passing
by
of
a
moonlight
night
and
a
little
piper
among
them
and
he
playing
music
that
mortal
man
never
heard
the
like
or
he
tell
you
that
himself
say
agin
fairies
for
it
often
he
heard
their
music
at
the
old
bush
behind
the
house
ask
what
the
fairies
are
like
and
he
will
tell
you
well
pretty
much
what
wentz
tells
us
from
this
and
the
like
accounts
we
form
our
ideas
of
fairies
and
fairy
music
of
ghosts
mermaids
and
so
on
but
there
is
no
sequence
of
incidents
no
hero
no
heroine
no
story
again
ask
the
old
man
if
he
knows
a
story
or
märchen
and
he
will
ask
you
at
once
you
ever
hear
the
speckled
bull
did
you
ever
hear
the
well
at
the
end
of
the
world
did
you
ever
hear
the
tailor
and
the
three
beasts
did
you
ever
hear
the
hornless
cow
ask
him
to
relate
one
of
these
and
if
you
get
him
in
the
right
vein
which
may
be
perhaps
one
time
in
ten
or
if
you
induce
the
right
vein
which
you
may
do
perhaps
nine
times
out
of
ten
you
will
find
him
begin
with
a
certain
gravity
and
solemnity
at
the
very
beginning
thus
was
once
in
old
times
and
in
old
times
it
was
a
king
in
ireland
or
perhaps
man
who
married
a
second
wife
or
perhaps
widow
woman
with
only
one
son
and
the
tale
proceeds
to
recount
the
life
and
adventures
of
the
heroes
or
heroines
whose
biographies
told
in
irish
in
a
sort
of
stereotyped
form
may
take
from
ten
minutes
to
half
an
hour
to
get
through
some
stories
would
burn
out
a
dip
candle
in
the
telling
or
even
last
the
whole
night
but
these
stories
have
little
or
nothing
to
say
to
the
questions
raised
in
this
book
the
problem
we
have
to
deal
with
is
a
startling
one
as
thus
put
before
us
by
wentz
are
these
beings
of
the
spirit
world
real
beings
having
a
veritable
existence
of
their
own
in
a
world
of
their
own
or
are
they
only
the
creation
of
the
imagination
of
his
informants
and
the
tradition
of
bygone
centuries
the
newspaper
the
school
and
the
have
answered
to
their
own
entire
satisfaction
that
these
things
are
imagination
pure
and
simple
yet
this
condemnation
does
not
always
carry
with
it
a
perfect
conviction
we
do
not
doubt
the
existence
of
or
kingfishers
although
nine
hundred
and
people
out
of
every
thousand
pass
their
entire
lives
without
being
vouchsafed
a
glimpse
of
them
in
their
live
state
and
may
it
not
be
the
same
with
the
creatures
of
the
spirit
world
may
not
they
also
exist
though
to
only
one
in
a
thousand
it
be
vouchsafed
to
behold
them
the
spirit
creatures
can
not
be
stuffed
and
put
into
museums
like
rare
animals
and
birds
whose
existence
we
might
doubt
of
if
we
had
not
seen
them
there
yet
they
may
exist
just
as
such
animals
and
birds
do
though
we
can
not
see
them
i
at
least
have
often
been
tempted
to
think
so
but
the
following
considerations
partly
drawn
from
comparative
have
made
me
hesitate
about
definitely
accepting
any
theory
in
the
first
place
then
viewing
the
irish
as
a
whole
we
find
that
it
contains
even
on
wentz
showing
quite
a
number
of
different
orders
of
beings
of
varying
shapes
appearances
size
and
functions
are
we
to
believe
that
all
those
beings
equally
exist
and
on
the
principle
that
there
can
be
no
smoke
without
a
fire
are
we
to
hold
that
there
would
be
no
popular
conception
of
the
banshee
the
leprechaun
or
the
mermaid
and
consequently
no
tales
told
about
them
if
such
beings
did
not
exist
and
from
time
to
time
allow
themselves
to
be
seen
like
the
and
the
kingfisher
this
question
is
moreover
further
complicated
by
the
belief
in
the
appearance
of
things
that
are
or
appear
to
be
inanimate
objects
not
living
beings
such
as
the
deaf
coach
or
the
phantom
ship
in
full
sail
the
appearance
of
which
yeats
has
immortalized
in
one
of
his
earliest
and
finest
poems
again
although
the
banshee
leprechaun
and
the
like
are
the
most
commonly
known
and
usually
seen
creatures
of
the
spirit
world
yet
great
quantities
of
other
appearances
are
believed
to
have
been
also
sporadically
met
with
i
very
well
remember
sitting
one
night
some
four
or
five
years
ago
in
an
hotel
in
indianapolis
and
talking
to
four
irishmen
one
or
two
of
them
very
wealthy
and
all
prosperous
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
talk
happened
to
turn
upon
spirits
the
only
time
during
my
entire
american
experiences
in
which
such
a
thing
happened
and
each
man
of
the
four
had
a
story
of
his
own
to
tell
in
which
he
was
a
convinced
believer
of
ghostly
manifestations
seen
by
him
in
ireland
two
of
these
manifestations
were
of
beings
that
would
fall
into
no
known
category
a
monstrous
rabbit
as
big
as
an
ass
which
plunged
into
the
sea
rabbits
can
swim
and
a
white
heifer
which
ascended
to
heaven
were
two
of
them
i
myself
when
a
boy
of
ten
or
eleven
was
perfectly
convinced
that
on
a
fine
early
dewy
morning
in
summer
when
people
were
still
in
bed
i
saw
a
strange
horse
run
round
a
field
of
ours
and
change
into
a
woman
who
ran
even
swifter
than
the
horse
and
after
a
couple
of
courses
round
the
field
disappeared
into
our
haggard
i
am
sure
whatever
i
may
believe
no
earthly
persuasion
would
at
the
time
have
convinced
me
that
i
did
not
see
this
yet
i
never
saw
it
again
and
never
heard
of
any
one
else
seeing
the
same
my
object
in
mentioning
these
things
is
to
show
that
if
we
concede
the
real
objective
existence
of
let
us
say
the
apparently
banshee
where
are
we
to
stop
for
any
number
of
beings
more
or
less
well
authenticated
come
crowding
on
her
heels
so
many
indeed
that
they
would
point
to
a
far
more
extensive
world
of
different
shapes
than
is
usually
suspected
not
to
speak
of
inanimate
objects
like
the
coach
and
the
ship
of
course
there
is
nothing
inherently
impossible
in
all
these
shapes
existing
any
more
than
in
one
of
them
existing
but
they
all
seem
to
me
to
rest
upon
the
same
kind
of
testimony
stronger
in
the
case
of
some
less
strong
in
the
case
of
others
and
it
is
as
well
to
point
out
this
clearly
my
own
experience
is
that
beliefs
in
the
pronounced
shee
folk
and
in
other
denizens
of
the
invisible
world
is
in
many
places
rapidly
dying
in
reading
collections
like
those
of
wentz
and
others
one
is
naturally
inclined
to
exaggerate
the
extent
and
depth
of
these
traditions
they
certainly
still
exist
and
can
be
found
if
you
go
to
search
for
them
but
they
often
exist
almost
as
it
were
by
sufferance
only
in
spots
and
are
ceasing
to
be
any
longer
a
power
near
my
home
in
a
western
county
county
roscommon
rises
gently
a
slope
which
owing
to
the
flatness
of
the
surrounding
regions
almost
becomes
a
hill
and
is
a
conspicuous
object
for
many
miles
upon
every
side
the
old
people
called
it
in
irish
na
this
name
is
now
practically
lost
and
it
is
called
fairymount
so
extinct
have
the
traditions
of
the
who
lived
within
the
hill
become
that
a
high
ecclesiastic
recently
driving
by
asked
his
driver
was
there
an
irish
name
for
the
hill
and
what
was
it
and
his
driver
did
not
know
there
took
place
a
few
years
ago
a
much
talked
of
in
the
neighbouring
townland
of
or
meadow
of
the
fairies
and
many
newspaper
correspondents
came
to
view
it
one
of
the
natives
told
a
sympathetic
newspaper
reporter
we
always
knew
it
was
going
to
move
that
why
the
place
is
named
the
bog
was
always
in
a
shiver
i
have
never
been
able
to
hear
of
any
legends
attached
to
what
must
have
at
one
time
been
held
to
be
the
of
the
for
a
score
of
miles
round
it
of
all
the
beings
in
the
irish
mythological
world
the
are
however
apparently
the
oldest
and
the
most
distinctive
beside
them
in
literature
and
general
renown
all
other
beings
sink
into
insignificance
a
belief
in
them
formerly
dominated
the
whole
of
irish
life
the
or
tuatha
de
danann
were
a
people
like
ourselves
who
inhabited
the
hills
not
as
a
rule
the
highest
and
most
salient
eminences
but
i
think
more
usually
the
pleasant
undulating
slopes
or
gentle
and
who
lived
there
a
life
of
their
own
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
banqueting
or
making
war
and
leading
there
just
as
real
a
life
as
is
our
own
all
irish
literature
particularly
perhaps
the
of
the
ancients
na
abounds
with
reference
to
them
to
inquire
how
the
irish
originally
came
by
their
belief
in
these
beings
the
or
tuatha
de
danann
is
to
raise
a
question
which
can
not
be
answered
any
more
than
one
can
answer
the
question
where
did
the
romans
obtain
their
belief
in
bacchus
and
the
fauns
or
the
greeks
their
own
belief
in
the
beings
of
olympus
but
granting
such
belief
to
have
been
indigenous
to
the
irish
as
it
certainly
seems
to
have
been
then
the
tall
handsome
fairies
of
ben
bulbin
and
the
sligo
district
about
whom
wentz
tells
us
so
much
interesting
matter
might
be
accounted
for
as
being
a
continuation
of
the
tradition
of
the
ancient
gaels
or
piece
of
heredity
inherent
in
the
i
mean
in
other
words
that
the
tradition
about
these
handsome
dwellers
within
the
having
been
handed
down
for
ages
and
having
been
perhaps
exceptionally
well
preserved
in
those
districts
people
saw
just
what
they
had
always
been
told
existed
or
if
i
may
so
put
it
they
saw
what
they
expected
to
see
fin
bheara
the
king
of
the
connacht
fairies
in
cnoc
meadha
or
castlehacket
in
the
county

all
the
beautiful
forms
seen
by

the

all
the

so
forth
who
are
seen
in
raths
and
moats
and
on
are
the
direct
descendants
so
to
speak
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
the
of
this
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
but
then
how
are
we
to
account
for
the
little
men
and
women
and
the
leprechauns
yet
are
they
any
more
wonderful
than
the
pygmies
of
classic
tradition
is
not
the
mermaid
to
be
found
in
greece
and
is
not
the
lorelei
as
germanic
as
the
kelpy
is
caledonian
if
we
grant
that
all
these
are
creatures
of
primitive
then
how
they
come
to
be
so
ceases
to
be
a
celtic
problem
it
becomes
a
world
problem
but
granted
as
i
say
that
they
were
all
creatures
of
primitive
then
their
occasional
appearances
or
the
belief
in
such
may
be
accounted
for
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
i
have
suggested
to
be
possible
in
the
case
of
the
ben
bulbin
fairies
as
for
the
belief
in
ghosts
or
in
irish
or
it
seems
to
me
that
this
may
possibly
rest
to
some
extent
upon
a
different
footing
altogether
here
we
are
not
confronted
by
a
different
order
of
beings
of
different
shapes
and
attributes
from
our
own
but
only
with
the
appearances
amongst
the
living
of
men
who
were
believed
or
known
to
be
dead
or
far
away
from
the
scene
of
their
appearances
even
those
who
may
be
most
sceptical
about
the
and
the
leprechauns
are
likely
to
be
convinced
on
the
mere
evidence
that
the
existence
of
bodies
or
or
whatever
we
may
call
them
and
the
appearances
of
people
especially
in
the
hour
of
their
death
to
other
people
who
were
perhaps
hundreds
of
miles
away
at
the
time
is
amply
proven
yet
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
originally
when
man
was
young
i
do
not
think
that
this
had
in
later
times
any
more
direct
bearing
upon
the
belief
in
the
the
leprechauns
the
mermaid
and
similar
beings
than
upon
the
belief
in
the
greek
pantheon
the
naiads
the
dryads
or
the
fauns
all
of
which
beliefs
probably
arising
originally
from
an
animistic
source
must
have
differentiated
themselves
at
a
very
early
period
of
course
every
real
apparition
every
apparition
tends
now
and
must
have
tended
at
all
times
to
strengthen
every
spirit
belief
for
do
not
ghost
apparitions
belong
in
a
way
to
the
same
realm
as
all
the
others
we
have
spoken
of
that
is
to
a
realm
equally
outside
our
normal
experience
another
very
interesting
point
and
one
hitherto
generally
overlooked
is
this
that
different
parts
of
the
irish
soil
cherish
different
bodies
of
supernatural
beings
the
north
of
ireland
believes
in
beings
unknown
in
the
south
and
leinster
has
spirits
unknown
to
the
west
some
places
seem
to
be
almost
given
up
to
special
beliefs
any
outsider
for
instance
who
may
have
read
that
powerful
and
grisly
book
légende
de
la
by
anatole
le
braz
in
two
large
volumes
all
about
the
awful
appearances
of
death
who
simply
dominates
the
of
brittany
will
probably
be
very
much
astonished
to
know
that
though
i
have
been
collecting
irish
all
my
life
i
have
never
met
death
figuring
as
a
personality
in
more
than
two
or
three
tales
and
these
mostly
of
a
trivial
or
humorous
description
though
the
deaf
coach
the
belief
in
which
is
pretty
general
does
seem
a
kind
of
parallel
to
the
creaking
cart
in
which
rides
i
would
suggest
then
that
the
restriction
of
certain
forms
of
spirits
if
i
may
so
call
them
to
certain
localities
may
be
due
to
race
intermixture
i
would
imagine
that
where
the
people
of
a
primitive
tribe
settled
down
most
strongly
they
also
most
strongly
preserved
the
memory
of
those
supernatural
beings
who
were
peculiarly
their
own
the
appear
to
be
and
distinctively
milesian
but
the
name
of
some
little
spirit
in
meath
and
portion
of
ulster
may
have
been
believed
in
by
a
race
entirely
different
from
that
which
believed
in
the
a
munster
sprite
some
of
these
beliefs
may
be
aryan
but
many
are
probably
is
it
not
strange
that
while
the
names
and
exploits
of
the
great
heroes
of
the
various
saga
cycles
of
ireland
cuchulainn
conor
mac
nessa
finn
osgar
oisin
and
the
rest
are
at
present
the
inheritance
of
all
ireland
and
are
known
in
every
part
of
it
there
should
still
be
as
i
have
said
supernatural
beings
believed
in
which
are
unknown
outside
of
their
own
districts
and
of
which
the
rest
of
ireland
has
never
heard
if
the
inhabitants
of
the
limited
districts
in
which
these
are
seen
still
think
they
see
them
my
suggestion
is
that
the
earlier
race
handed
down
an
account
of
the
primitive
beings
believed
in
by
their
own
tribe
and
later
generations
if
they
saw
anything
saw
just
what
they
were
told
existed
whilst
far
from
questioning
the
actual
existence
of
certain
spiritual
forms
and
apparitions
i
venture
to
throw
out
these
considerations
for
what
they
may
be
worth
and
i
desire
again
to
thank
wentz
for
all
the
valuable
data
he
has
collected
for
throwing
light
upon
so
interesting
a
question
ratra
frenchpark
county
roscommon
ireland
the
fairy
folk
of
tara
on
the
ancient
hill
of
tara
from
whose
heights
the
high
kings
once
ruled
all
ireland
from
where
the
sacred
fires
in
pagan
days
announced
the
annual
resurrection
of
the
sun
the
easter
tide
where
the
magic
of
patrick
prevailed
over
the
magic
of
the
druids
and
where
the
hosts
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
were
wont
to
appear
at
the
great
feast
of
the
of
modern
times
hold
undisputed
sovereignty
and
from
no
point
better
than
tara
which
thus
was
once
the
magical
and
political
centre
of
the
sacred
island
could
we
begin
our
study
of
the
irish
though
the
hill
has
lain
unploughed
and
deserted
since
the
curses
of
christian
priests
fell
upon
it
on
the
calm
air
of
summer
evenings
at
the
twilight
hour
wondrous
music
still
sounds
over
its
slopes
and
at
night
long
weird
processions
of
silent
spirits
march
round
its
and
it
is
only
men
who
fear
the
curse
of
the
christians
the
regard
it
not
the
rev
father
peter
kenney
of
kilmessan
had
directed
me
to
john
graham
an
old
man
over
seventy
years
of
age
who
has
lived
near
tara
most
of
his
life
and
after
i
had
found
john
and
he
had
led
me
from
to
and
then
right
through
the
length
of
the
site
where
once
stood
the
banquet
hall
of
kings
and
heroes
and
druids
as
he
earnestly
described
the
past
glories
of
tara
to
which
these
ancient
monuments
bear
silent
testimony
we
sat
down
in
the
thick
sweet
grass
on
the
sacred
hill
and
began
talking
of
the
olden
times
in
ireland
and
then
of
the
people
people
sure
as
you
are
sitting
down
i
heard
the
pipes
there
in
that
wood
pointing
to
a
wood
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
and
west
of
the
banquet
hall
i
heard
the
music
another
time
on
a
hot
summer
evening
at
the
rath
of
ringlestown
in
a
field
where
all
the
grass
had
been
burned
off
and
i
often
heard
it
in
the
wood
of
tara
whenever
the
play
you
hear
their
music
all
through
the
field
as
plain
as
can
be
and
it
is
the
grandest
kind
of
music
it
may
last
half
the
night
but
once
day
comes
it
ends
the
people
i
now
asked
john
what
sort
of
a
race
the
people
are
and
where
they
came
from
and
this
is
his
reply
killed
and
murdered
in
war
stay
on
earth
till
their
time
is
up
and
they
are
among
the
the
souls
on
this
earth
are
as
thick
as
the
grass
running
his
through
a
thick
clump
and
you
ca
see
them
and
evil
spirits
are
just
as
thick
too
and
people
do
know
it
because
there
are
so
many
spirits
knocking
going
about
they
must
appear
to
some
people
the
old
folk
saw
the
here
on
the
hill
a
hundred
times
and
they
always
be
talking
about
them
the
can
see
everything
and
you
dare
not
meddle
with
them
they
live
in
and
their
houses
are
in
them
the
opinion
always
was
that
they
are
a
race
of
spirits
for
they
can
go
into
different
forms
and
can
appear
big
as
well
as
little
evidence
from
kilmessan
near
tara
john
boylin
born
in
county
meath
about
sixty
years
ago
will
be
our
witness
from
kilmessan
a
village
about
two
miles
from
tara
and
he
being
one
of
the
men
of
the
vicinity
best
informed
about
its
is
able
to
offer
testimony
of
very
great
value
fairy
is
said
to
be
a
whole
tribe
of
little
red
men
living
in
glen
odder
between
ringlestown
and
tara
and
on
long
evenings
in
june
they
have
been
heard
there
are
other
breeds
or
castes
of
fairies
and
it
seems
to
me
when
i
recall
our
ancient
traditions
that
some
of
these
fairies
are
of
the
fir
bolgs
some
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
some
of
the
milesians
all
of
them
have
been
seen
serenading
round
the
western
slope
of
tara
dressed
in
ancient
irish
costumes
unlike
the
little
red
men
these
fairy
races
are
warlike
and
given
to
making
invasions
long
processions
of
them
have
been
seen
going
round
the
king
chair
an
earthwork
on
which
the
kings
of
tara
are
said
to
have
been
crowned
and
they
then
would
appear
like
soldiers
of
ancient
ireland
in
review
fairy
were
told
as
children
that
as
soon
as
night
fell
the
fairies
from
rath
ringlestown
would
form
in
a
procession
across
tara
road
pass
round
certain
bushes
which
have
not
been
disturbed
for
ages
and
join
the
or
host
of
industrious
folk
the
red
fairies
we
were
afraid
and
our
nurses
always
brought
us
home
before
the
advent
of
the
fairy
procession
one
of
the
passes
used
by
this
procession
happened
to
be
between
two
houses
and
it
is
said
that
a
man
went
out
of
one
of
these
houses
at
the
wrong
time
for
when
found
he
was
dead
the
fairies
had
him
because
he
interfered
with
their
procession
through
cutting
man
named
caffney
cut
as
fuel
to
boil
his
pot
of
potatoes
some
of
these
undisturbed
bushes
round
which
the
fairies
pass
when
he
put
the
wood
under
the
pot
though
it
spat
fire
and
would
come
out
of
it
it
would
not
burn
the
man
pined
away
gradually
in
six
months
after
cutting
the
he
was
dead
just
before
he
died
he
told
his
experiences
with
the
wood
to
his
brother
and
his
brother
told
me
fairies
are
the
to
the
local
belief
fairies
are
the
spirits
of
the
departed
tradition
says
that
hugh
in
the
sixteenth
century
after
his
march
to
the
south
encamped
his
army
on
the
or
of
ringlestown
to
be
assisted
by
the
spirits
of
the
mighty
dead
who
dwelt
within
this
and
it
is
believed
that
gerald
fitzgerald
has
been
seen
coming
out
of
the
hill
of
mollyellen
down
in
county
louth
leading
his
horse
and
dressed
in
the
old
irish
costume
with
breastplate
spear
and
war
outfit
carroll
was
possessed
by
a
it
is
known
that
her
father
held
communion
with
evil
spirits
and
it
appears
that
they
often
assisted
him
the
carrolls
house
was
built
at
the
end
of
a
fairy
and
part
of
it
was
scooped
out
of
this
rose
grew
so
peculiar
that
her
folks
locked
her
up
after
two
years
she
was
able
to
shake
off
the
fairy
possession
by
being
taken
to
father
robinson
sisters
and
then
to
an
old
in
drogheda
in
the
valley
of
the
boyne
in
walking
along
the
river
boyne
from
slane
to
knowth
and
new
grange
i
stopped
at
the
cottage
of
owen
morgan
at
or
wood
of
the
kings
though
the
ancient
wood
has
long
since
disappeared
and
as
we
sat
looking
out
over
the
sunlit
beauty
of
ireland
classic
river
and
in
full
view
of
the
first
of
the
famous
this
is
what
owen
morgan
told
me
the
shoemaker
daughter
became
the
queen
of
olden
times
there
lived
a
shoemaker
and
his
wife
up
there
near
moat
knowth
and
their
first
child
was
taken
by
the
queen
of
the
fairies
who
lived
inside
the
moat
and
a
little
leprechaun
left
in
its
place
the
same
exchange
was
made
when
the
second
child
was
born
at
the
birth
of
the
third
child
the
fairy
queen
came
again
and
ordered
one
of
her
three
servants
to
take
the
child
but
the
child
could
not
be
moved
because
of
a
great
beam
of
iron
too
heavy
to
lift
which
lay
across
the
breast
the
second
servant
and
then
the
third
failed
like
the
first
and
the
queen
herself
could
not
move
the
child
the
mother
being
short
of
pins
had
used
a
needle
to
fasten
the
child
clothes
and
that
was
what
appeared
to
the
fairies
as
a
beam
of
iron
for
there
was
virtue
in
steel
in
those
days
the
fairy
queen
decided
to
bestow
gifts
upon
the
child
and
advised
each
of
the
three
servants
to
give
in
turn
a
different
gift
the
first
one
said
may
she
be
the
grandest
lady
in
the
world
the
second
one
said
may
she
be
the
greatest
singer
in
the
world
and
the
third
one
said
may
she
be
the
best
in
the
world
then
the
fairy
queen
said
your
gifts
are
all
very
good
but
i
will
give
a
gift
of
my
own
better
than
any
of
them
the
first
time
she
happens
to
go
out
of
the
house
let
her
come
back
into
it
under
the
form
of
a
rat
the
mother
heard
all
that
the
fairy
women
said
and
so
she
never
permitted
her
daughter
to
leave
the
house
the
girl
reached
the
age
of
eighteen
it
happened
that
the
young
prince
of
tara
in
riding
by
on
a
hunt
heard
her
singing
and
so
entranced
was
he
with
the
music
that
he
stopped
to
listen
and
the
song
ended
he
entered
the
house
and
upon
seeing
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
singer
asked
her
to
marry
him
the
mother
said
that
could
not
be
and
taking
the
daughter
out
of
the
house
for
the
first
time
brought
her
back
into
it
in
an
apron
under
the
form
of
a
rat
that
the
prince
might
understand
the
refusal
enchantment
however
did
not
change
the
prince
love
for
the
beautiful
singer
and
he
explained
how
there
was
a
day
mentioned
with
his
father
the
king
for
all
the
great
ladies
of
ireland
to
assemble
in
the
halls
of
tara
and
that
the
grandest
lady
and
the
greatest
singer
and
the
best
would
be
chosen
as
his
wife
when
he
added
that
each
lady
must
come
in
a
chariot
the
rat
spoke
to
him
and
said
that
he
must
send
to
her
home
on
the
day
named
four
piebald
cats
and
a
pack
of
cards
and
that
she
would
make
her
appearance
provided
that
at
the
time
her
chariot
came
to
the
halls
of
tara
no
one
save
the
prince
should
be
allowed
near
it
and
she
finally
said
to
the
prince
until
the
day
mentioned
with
your
father
you
must
carry
me
as
a
rat
in
your
pocket
before
the
great
day
arrived
the
rat
had
made
everything
known
to
one
of
the
fairy
women
and
so
when
the
four
piebald
cats
and
the
pack
of
cards
reached
the
girl
home
the
fairies
at
once
turned
the
cats
into
the
four
most
splendid
horses
in
the
world
and
the
pack
of
cards
into
the
most
wonderful
chariot
in
the
world
and
as
the
chariot
was
setting
out
from
the
moat
for
tara
the
fairy
queen
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
and
the
enchantment
over
the
girl
was
broken
so
that
she
became
as
before
the
prettiest
lady
in
the
world
and
she
sitting
in
the
chariot
the
prince
saw
the
wonderful
chariot
coming
he
knew
whose
it
was
and
went
out
alone
to
meet
it
but
he
could
not
believe
his

on
seeing
the
lady
inside
and
then
she
told
him
about
the
witches
and
fairies
and
explained
everything
of
ladies
had
come
to
the
halls
of
tara
from
all
ireland
and
every
one
as
grand
as
could
be
the
contest
began
with
the
singing
and
ended
with
the
and
the
young
girl
was
the
last
to
appear
but
to
the
amazement
of
all
the
company
the
king
had
to
give
in
admit
that
the
strange
woman
was
the
grandest
lady
the
greatest
singer
and
the
best
in
ireland
and
when
the
old
king
died
she
became
the
queen
of
tara
after
this
ancient
legend
which
owen
morgan
heard
from
the
old
folks
when
he
was
a
boy
he
told
me
many
anecdotes
about
the
people
of
the
boyne
who
are
little
men
usually
dressed
in
red
people
at
new
between
knowth
and
new
grange
i
met
maggie
timmons
carrying
a
pail
of
to
her
calves
and
when
we
stopped
on
the
road
to
talk
i
asked
her
in
due
time
if
any
of
the
people
ever
appeared
in
the
region
or
about
new
grange
which
we
could
see
in
the
field
and
she
replied
in
reference
to
new
grange
am
sure
the
neighbours
used
to
see
the
come
out
of
it
at
night
and
in
the
morning
the
inherited
the
then
i
asked
her
what
the
people
are
and
she
said
they
disappear
they
go
like
fog
they
must
be
something
like
spirits
or
how
could
they
disappear
in
that
way
i
knew
of
people
she
added
would
milk
in
the
fields
about
here
and
spill
milk
on
the
ground
for
the
and
pots
of
potatoes
would
be
put
out
for
the

the
testimony
of
an
irish
priest
we
now
pass
directly
to
west
ireland
in
many
ways
our
most
important
field
and
where
of
all
places
in
the
celtic
world
the
is
vigorously
alive
and
it
seems
very
fitting
to
offer
the
first
opportunity
to
testify
in
behalf
of
that
district
to
a
scholarly
priest
of
the
roman
church
for
what
he
tells
us
is
almost
wholly
the
result
of
his
own
memories
and
experiences
as
an
irish
boy
in
connemara
supplemented
in
a
valuable
way
by
his
wider
and
more
mature
knowledge
of
the
as
he
sees
it
now
among
his
own
parishioners
ma
ma
which
you
see
over
there
is
said
to
contain
excavated
passages
and
a
palace
where
the
fairies
live
and
with
them
the
people
they
have
and
from
the
inside
of
the
hill
there
is
believed
to
be
an
entrance
to
an
underground
world
it
is
a
common
opinion
that
after
consumptives
die
they
are
there
with
the
fairies
in
good
health
the
wasted
body
is
not
taken
into
the
hill
for
it
is
usually
regarded
as
not
the
body
of
the
deceased
but
rather
as
that
of
a
changeling
the
general
belief
being
that
the
real
body
and
the
soul
are
carried
off
together
and
those
of
an
old
person
from
fairyland
substituted
the
old
person
left
soon
declines
and
dies
against
was
proper
when
having
finished
milking
a
cow
to
put
one
thumb
in
the
pail
of
milk
and
with
the
wet
thumb
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
the
thigh
of
the
cow
on
the
side
milked
to
be
safe
against
fairies
and
i
have
seen
them
when
churning
put
a
live
coal
about
an
inch
square
under
the
churn
because
it
was
an
old
custom
connected
with
fairies
and
butter
for
milk
falls
on
the
ground
in
milking
a
cow
is
taken
by
the
fairies
for
fairies
need
a
little
milk
also
after
churning
the
knife
which
is
run
through
the
butter
in
drying
it
must
not
be
scraped
clean
for
what
sticks
to
it
belongs
to
the
fairies
out
of
three
pounds
of
butter
for
example
an
ounce
or
two
would
be
left
for
the
fairies
i
have
seen
this
several
times
a
stream
and
out
on
a
dark
night
if
pursued
by
fairies
or
ghosts
one
is
considered
quite
safe
if
one
can
get
over
some
stream
i
remember
coming
home
on
a
dark
night
with
a
boy
companion
and
hearing
a
noise
and
then
after
we
had
run
to
a
stream
and
crossed
it
feeling
quite
safe
heap
of
stones
in
a
field
should
not
be
disturbed
though
needed
for
building
especially
if
they
are
part
of
an
ancient
tumulus
the
fairies
are
said
to
live
inside
the
pile
and
to
move
the
stones
would
be
most
unfortunate
if
a
house
happens
to
be
built
on
a
fairy
preserve
or
in
a
fairy
track
the
occupants
will
have
no
luck
everything
will
go
wrong
their
animals
will
die
their
children
fall
sick
and
no
end
of
trouble
will
come
on
them
when
the
house
happens
to
have
been
built
in
a
fairy
track
the
doors
on
the
front
and
back
or
the
windows
if
they
are
in
the
line
of
the
track
can
not
be
kept
closed
at
night
for
the
fairies
must
march
through
near
ballinrobe
there
is
an
old
which
is
still
the
preserve
of
the
fairies
and
the
land
round
it
the
soil
is
very
fine
and
yet
no
one
would
dare
to
till
it
some
time
ago
in
laying
out
a
new
road
the
engineers
determined
to
run
it
through
the
but
the
people
rose
almost
in
rebellion
and
the
course
had
to
be
changed
the
farmers
would
cut
down
a
tree
or
bush
growing
on
the
hill
or
preserve
for
anything
control
over
are
believed
to
control
crops
and
their
ripening
a
field
of
turnips
may
promise
well
and
its
owner
will
count
on
so
many
tons
to
the
acre
but
if
when
the
crop
is
gathered
it
is
found
to
be
far
short
of
the
estimate
the
explanation
is
that
the
fairies
have
extracted
so
much
substance
from
it
the
same
thing
is
the
case
with
corn
eve
and
november
eve
it
is
not
right
to
gather
or
eat
blackberries
or
sloes
nor
after
that
time
as
long
as
they
last
on
november
eve
the
fairies
pass
over
all
such
things
and
make
them
unfit
to
eat
if
one
dares
to
eat
them
afterwards
one
will
have
serious
illness
we
firmly
believed
this
as
boys
and
i
laugh
now
when
i
think
how
we
used
to
gorge
ourselves
with
berries
on
the
last
day
of
october
and
then
for
weeks
after
pass
by
bushes
full
of
the
most
luscious
fruit
and
with
mouths
watering
for
it
could
eat
it
as
is
an
old
abbey
on
the
river
in
county
mayo
and
people
say
the
fairies
had
a
great
battle
near
it
and
that
the
slaughter
was
tremendous
at
the
time
the
fairies
appeared
as
swarms
of
flies
coming
from
every
direction
to
that
spot
some
came
from
knock
ma
and
some
from
south
ireland
the
opinion
being
that
fairies
can
assume
any
form
they
like
the
battle
lasted
a
day
and
a
night
and
when
it
was
over
one
could
have
filled
baskets
with
the
dead
flies
which
floated
down
the
river
who
return
from
in
a
short
of
two
or
three
days
duration
are
said
to
be
away
with
the
fairies
enjoying
a
festival
the
festival
may
be
very
material
in
its
nature
or
it
may
be
purely
spiritual
sometimes
one
may
thus
go
to
faerie
for
an
hour
or
two
or
one
may
remain
there
for
seven
fourteen
or
years
the
mind
of
a
person
coming
out
of
fairyland
is
usually
a
blank
as
to
what
has
been
seen
and
done
there
another
idea
is
that
the
person
knows
well
enough
all
about
fairyland
but
is
prevented
from
communicating
the
knowledge
a
certain
woman
of
whom
i
knew
said
she
had
forgotten
all
about
her
experiences
in
faerie
but
a
friend
who
heard
her
objected
and
said
she
did
remember
and
would
tell
a
man
may
remain
awake
at
night
to
watch
one
who
has
been
to
fairyland
to
see
if
that
one
holds
communication
with
the
fairies
others
say
in
such
a
case
that
the
fairies
know
you
are
on
the
alert
and
will
not
be
discovered
the
testimony
of
a
galway
piper
according
to
our
next
witness
steven
ruan
a
piper
of
galway
with
whom
i
have
often
talked
there
is
one
class
of
fairies
are
nobody
else
than
the
spirits
of
men
and
women
who
once
lived
on
earth
and
the
banshee
is
a
dead
friend
relative
or
ancestor
who
appears
to
give
a
warning
fairies
he
says
care
about
old
folks
they
only
babies
and
young
men
and
young
women
if
a
young
wife
dies
she
is
said
to
have
been
by
and
ever
afterwards
to
live
in
fairyland
the
same
things
are
said
about
a
young
man
or
a
child
who
dies
fairyland
is
a
place
of
delights
where
music
and
singing
and
dancing
and
feasting
are
continually
enjoyed
and
its
inhabitants
are
all
about
us
as
numerous
as
the
blades
of
grass
fairy
in
the
course
of
another
conversation
steven
pointed
to
a
rocky
knoll
in
a
field
not
far
from
his
home
and
said
saw
a
dog
with
a
white
ring
around
his
neck
by
that
hill
there
and
the
oldest
men
round
galway
have
seen
him
too
for
he
has
been
here
for
one
hundred
years
or
more
he
is
a
dog
of
the
and
only
appears
at
certain
hours
of
the
night
old
piper
in
and
before
we
had
done
talking
the
subject
of
came
up
and
the
following
little
story
coming
from
one
of
the
last
of
the
old
irish
pipers
himself
about
a
brother
piper
is
of
more
than
ordinary
value
used
to
be
an
old
piper
called
flannery
who
lived
in
oranmore
county
galway
i
imagine
he
was
one
of
the
old
generation
and
one
time
the
took
him
to
fairyland
to
learn
his
profession
he
studied
music
with
them
for
a
long
time
and
when
he
returned
he
was
as
great
a
piper
as
any
in
ireland
but
he
died
young
for
the
wanted
him
to
play
for
them
the
testimony
of
patsy
of
aranmore
our
next
witness
is
an
old
man
familiarly
called
patsy
who
is
a
native
of
the
island
of
aranmore
off
the
coast
from
galway
and
he
lives
on
the
island
amid
a
little
group
of
homes
called
oak
quarter
as
patsy
stood
beside
a
rude
stone
cross
near
oak
quarter
in
one
of
those
curious
places
on
aranmore
where
each
passing
funeral
stops
long
enough
to
erect
a
little
memorial
pile
of
stones
on
the
smooth
rocky
surface
of
the
roadside
enclosure
he
told
me
many
anecdotes
about
the
mysteries
of
his
native
island
twenty
years
or
so
ago
round
the
of
dermot
and
grania
just
above
us
on
the
hill
there
were
seen
many
fairies
of
them
said
patsy
and
a
single
deer
they
began
to
chase
the
deer
and
followed
it
right
over
the
island
at
another
time
similar
little
people
chased
a
horse
rocks
were
full
of
them
and
they
were
small
fellows
fairy
beating
in
a
the
south
island
he
continued
night
was
coming
on
a
man
was
giving
his
cow
water
at
a
well
and
as
he
looked
on
the
other
side
of
a
wall
he
saw
many
strange
people
playing
hurley
when
they
noticed
him
looking
at
them
one
came
up
and
struck
the
cow
a
hard
blow
and
turning
on
the
man
cut
his
face
and
body
very
badly
the
man
might
not
have
been
so
badly
off
but
he
returned
to
the
well
after
the
first
encounter
and
got
five
times
as
bad
a
beating
and
when
he
reached
home
he
could
speak
at
all
until
the
cock
crew
then
he
told
about
his
adventures
and
slept
a
little
when
he
woke
up
in
the
daylight
he
was
none
the
worse
for
his
beating
for
the
fairies
had
rubbed
something
on
his
face
patsy
says
he
knew
the
man
who
if
still
alive
is
now
in
america
where
he
went
several
years
ago
fairies
when
i
asked
patsy
where
the
fairies
live
he
turned
half
around
and
pointing
in
the
direction
of
dun
aengus
which
was
in
full
view
on
the
sharp
of
aranmore
said
that
there
in
a
large
tumulus
on
the
below
it
they
had
one
of
their
favourite
abodes
but
he
added
rocks
are
full
of
them
and
they
are
small
fellows
just
across
the
road
from
where
we
were
standing
in
a
spot
near
oak
quarter
another
place
was
pointed
out
where
the
fairies
are
often
seen
dancing
the
name
of
it
is
an
little
bog
of
the
dance
other
sorts
of
fairies
live
in
the
sea
and
some
of
them
who
live
on
aranmore
probably
in
conjunction
with
those
in
the
sea
go
out
over
the
water
and
cause
storms
and
wind
the
testimony
of
a
roman
catholic
theologian
the
following
evidence
by
the
rev
father
came
out
during
a
discussion
concerning
spirits
and
fairies
as
regarded
by
roman
catholic
theology
which
he
and
i
enjoyed
when
we
met
as
fellow
travellers
in
galway
town
magic
and
according
to
catholic
theology
is
nothing
else
than
the
solicitation
of
spiritual
powers
to
help
us
if
evil
spirits
are
evoked
by
certain
irrational
practices
it
is
unholy
magic
and
this
is
altogether
forbidden
by
our
church
all
charms
spells
divination
necromancy
or
geomancy
are
unholy
magic
holy
magic
is
practised
by
carrying
the
cross
in
christ
now
evil
magic
has
been
practised
here
in
ireland
butter
has
been
so
that
none
came
from
the
churning
cows
have
been
made
to
die
of
maladies
and
fields
made
unproductive
a
cow
was
bought
from
an
old
woman
in
connemara
and
no
butter
was
ever
had
from
the
cow
until
exorcism
with
holy
water
was
performed
this
is
reported
to
me
as
a
fact
and
in
another
relation
the
rev
father
said
what
for
us
is
highly
significant
private
opinion
is
that
in
certain
places
here
in
ireland
where
pagan
sacrifices
were
practised
evil
spirits
through
receiving
homage
gained
control
and
still
hold
control
unless
driven
out
by
exorcisms
the
testimony
of
the
town
clerk
of
tuam
to
the
town
clerk
of
tuam
john
glynn
who
since
his
boyhood
has
taken
a
keen
interest
in
the
traditions
of
his
native
county
i
am
indebted
for
the
following
valuable
summary
of
the
fairy
creed
in
that
part
of
north
galway
where
finvara
rules
of
the
tuam
whole
of
knock
ma
which
probably
means
hill
of
the
plain
is
said
to
be
the
palace
of
finvara
king
of
the
connaught
fairies
there
are
a
good
many
legends
about
finvara
but
very
few
about
queen
meave
in
this
region
of
caused
by
the
potato
crop
in
ireland
was
a
failure
and
very
much
suffering
resulted
at
the
time
the
country
people
in
these
parts
attributed
the
famine
to
disturbed
conditions
in
the
fairy
world
old
thady
steed
once
told
me
about
the
conditions
then
prevailing
sure
we
could
be
any
other
way
and
i
saw
the
and
hundreds
besides
me
saw
them
fighting
in
the
sky
over
knock
ma
and
on
towards
galway
and
i
heard
others
say
they
saw
the
fighting
also
and
the
are
said
to
be
immortal
and
the
fairy
world
is
always
described
as
an
immaterial
place
though
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
as
the
world
of
the
dead
sick
persons
however
are
often
said
to
be
with
the
fairies
and
when
cured
to
have
come
back
a
woman
who
died
here
about
thirty
years
ago
was
commonly
believed
to
have
been
with
the
fairies
during
her
seven
years
sickness
when
she
was
a
maiden
she
married
after
coming
back
and
had
children
and
she
was
always
able
to
see
the
and
to
talk
with
them
for
she
had
the
and
it
is
said
that
she
used
to
travel
with
the
fairies
at
night
after
her
marriage
she
lived
in
tuam
and
though
her
people
were
six
or
seven
miles
out
from
tuam
in
the
country
she
could
always
tell
all
that
was
taking
place
with
them

at
her
own

the
time
on

steal

if
the
chance
is
given
them
if
a
person
enters
a
house
then
and
churning
is
going
on
he
must
take
a
hand
in
it

else
there
will
be
no
butter
and
if
fire
is
given
away
on

nothing
will
go
right
for
the
whole
year
three
fairy
yet
certain
things
are
due
the
fairies
for
example
two
years
ago
in
the
court
room
here
in
tuam
a
woman
was
on
trial
for
watering
milk
and
to
the
surprise
of
us
all
who
were
conducting
the
proceedings
and
it
can
be
added
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
onlookers
she
swore
that
she
had
only
added
the
three
fairy
drops
of
after
it
has
been
put
out
at
night
for
the
fairies
is
not
allowed
to
be
eaten
afterwards
by
man
or
beast
not
even
by
pigs
such
food
is
said
to
have
no
real
substance
left
in
it
and
to
let
anything
eat
it
would
be
thought
of
the
underlying
idea
seems
to
be
that
the
fairies
extract
the
spiritual
essence
from
food
offered
to
them
leaving
behind
the
grosser
elements
the
fairy
tribes
under
the
various
kings
and
queens
have
a
battle
one
side
manages
to
have
a
living
man
among
them
and
he
by
knocking
the
fairies
about
turns
the
battle
in
case
the
side
he
is
on
is
losing
it
is
always
usual
for
the
munster
fairy
king
to
challenge
finvara
the
connaught
fairy
king
county
sligo
and
the
testimony
of
a
peasant
seer
the
ben
bulbin
country
in
county
sligo
is
one
of
those
rare
places
in
ireland
where
fairies
are
thought
to
be
visible
and
our
first
witness
from
there
claims
to
be
able
to
see
the
fairies
or
and
to
talk
with
them
this
mortal
so
favoured
lives
in
the
same
townland
where
his
fathers
have
lived
during
four
hundred
years
directly
beneath
the
shadows
of
ben
bulbin
on
whose
sides
dermot
is
said
to
have
been
killed
while
hunting
the
and
this
famous
old
mountain
honeycombed
with
curious
grottoes
ages
ago
when
the
sea
beat
against
its
perpendicular
flanks
is
the
very
place
where
the
have
their
chief
abode
even
on
its
broad
level
summit
for
it
is
a
high
square
tableland
like
a
mighty
cube
of
rock
set
down
upon
the
earth
by
some
antediluvian
god
there
are
treacherous
holes
wherein
more
than
one
hunter
may
have
been
lost
for
ever
penetrating
to
unknown
depths
and
by
listening
one
can
hear
the
tides
from
the
ocean
three
or
four
miles
away
surging
in
and
out
through
ancient
subterranean
channels
connected
with
these
holes
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
there
are
long
caverns
which
no
man
has
dared
to
penetrate
to
the
end
and
even
dogs
it
is
said
have
been
put
in
them
never
to
emerge
or
else
to
come
out
miles
away
one
day
when
the
heavy
white
hung
over
ben
bulbin
and
its
neighbours
and
there
was
a
weird
at
midday
over
the
purple
heather
at
their
base
and
the
rain
was
falling
i
sat
with
my
friend
before
a
comfortable
fire
of
fragrant
turf
in
his
cottage
and
heard
about
the
with
the
i
was
a
young
man
i
often
used
to
go
out
in
the
mountains
over
there
pointing
out
of
the
window
in
their
direction
to
fish
for
trout
or
to
hunt
and
it
was
in
january
on
a
cold
dry
day
while
carrying
my
gun
that
i
and
a
friend
with
me
as
we
were
walking
around
ben
bulbin
saw
one
of
the
for
the
first
time
i
knew
who
it
was
for
i
had
heard
the
described
ever
since
i
could
remember
and
this
one
was
dressed
in
blue
with
a
adorned
with
what
seemed
to
be
frills
when
he
came
up
to
us
he
said
to
me
in
a
sweet
and
silvery
voice
the
seldomer
you
come
to
this
mountain
the
better
a
young
lady
here
wants
to
take
you
away
then
he
told
us
not
to
fire
off
our
guns
because
the
dislike
being
disturbed
by
the
noise
and
he
seemed
to
be
like
a
soldier
of
the
on
guard
as
we
were
leaving
the
mountains
he
told
us
not
to
look
back
and
we
did
another
time
i
was
alone
in
nearly
the
same
region
when
i
heard
a
voice
say
it
is
barefooted
and
fishing
then
there
came
a
whistle
like
music
and
a
noise
like
the
beating
of
a
drum
and
soon
one
of
the
came
and
talked
with
me
for
half
an
hour
he
said
your
mother
will
die
in
eleven
months
and
do
not
let
her
die
unanointed
and
she
did
die
within
eleven
months
as
he
was
going
away
he
warned
me
you
must
be
in
the
house
before
sunset
do
not
delay
do
not
delay
they
can
do
nothing
to
you
until
i
get
back
in
the
castle
as
i
found
out
afterwards
he
was
going
to
me
but
hesitated
because
he
did
not
want
to
leave
my
mother
alone
after
these
warnings
i
was
always
afraid
to
go
to
the
mountains
but
lately
i
have
been
told
i
could
go
if
i
took
a
friend
with
me
have
always
befriended
and
protected
me
i
was
drowned
twice
but
for
them
once
i
was
going
to
durnish
island
a
mile
off
the
coast
the
channel
is
very
deep
and
at
the
time
there
was
a
rough
sea
with
the
tide
running
out
and
i
was
almost
lost
i
shrieked
and
shouted
and
finally
got
safe
to
the
mainland
the
day
i
talked
with
one
of
the
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
when
he
was
for
me
he
mentioned
this
and
said
they
were
the
ones
who
saved
me
from
drowning
then
in
ireland
the
live
inside
the
mountains
in
beautiful
castles
and
there
are
a
good
many
branches
of
them
in
other
countries
like
armies
they
have
various
stations
and
move
from
one
to
another
some
live
in
the
wicklow
mountains
near
dublin
control
over
human
take
a
great
interest
in
the
affairs
of
men
and
they
always
stand
for
justice
and
right
any
side
they
favour
in
our
wars
that
side
wins
they
favoured
the
boers
and
the
boers
did
get
their
rights
they
told
me
they
favoured
the
japanese
and
not
the
russians
because
the
russians
are
tyrants
sometimes
they
fight
among
themselves
one
of
them
once
said
i
fight
for
a
friend
or
i
fight
for
ireland
in
response
to
my
wish
this
description
of
the
was
given
folk
are
the
grandest
i
have
ever
seen
they
are
far
superior
to
us
and
that
is
why
they
are
called
the
they
are
not
a
working
class
but
a
class
tall
and
they
are
a
distinct
race
between
our
own
and
that
of
spirits
as
they
have
told
me
their
qualifications
are
tremendous
we
could
cut
off
half
the
human
race
but
would
not
they
said
for
we
are
expecting
salvation
and
i
knew
a
man
three
or
four
years
ago
whom
they
struck
down
with
paralysis
their
sight
is
so
penetrating
that
i
think
they
could
see
through
the
earth
they
have
a
silvery
voice
quick
and
sweet
the
music
they
play
is
most
beautiful
they
the
whole
body
and
soul
of
young
and
intellectual
people
who
are
interesting
transmuting
the
body
to
a
body
like
their
own
i
asked
them
once
if
they
ever
died
and
they
said
no
we
are
always
kept
young
once
they
take
you
and
you
taste
food
in
their
palace
you
can
not
come
back
you
are
changed
to
one
of
them
and
live
with
them
for
ever
they
are
able
to
appear
in
different
forms
one
once
appeared
to
me
and
seemed
only
four
feet
high
and
stoutly
built
he
said
i
am
bigger
than
i
appear
to
you
now
we
can
make
the
old
young
the
big
small
the
small
big
one
of
their
women
told
all
the
secrets
of
my
family
she
said
that
my
brother
in
australia
would
travel
much
and
suffer
hardships
all
of
which
came
true
and
foretold
that
my
nephew
then
about
two
years
old
would
become
a
great
clergyman
in
america
and
that
is
what
he
is
now
besides
the
who
are
a
distinct
class
there
are
bad
spirits
and
ghosts
which
are
nothing
like
them
my
mother
once
saw
a
leprechaun
beside
a
bush
hammering
he
disappeared
before
she
could
get
to
him
but
he
also
was
unlike
one
of
the
evidence
from
grange
our
next
witness
who
lives
about
three
miles
from
our
last
witness
is
hugh
currid
the
oldest
man
in
grange
and
so
old
is
he
that
now
he
does
little
more
than
sit
in
the
smoking
and
as
he
looks
at
the
red
glow
of
the
peat
dreaming
of
the
olden
times
hugh
knows
english
very
imperfectly
and
so
what
he
narrated
was
in
the
ancient
gaelic
which
his
fathers
spoke
when
father
hines
took
me
to
cottage
hugh
was
in
his
usual
silent
pose
before
the
fire
at
first
he
rather
resented
having
his
thoughts
disturbed
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
as
talkative
as
could
be
for
there
is
nothing
like
the
mention
of
ireland
to
get
him
started
the
father
left
us
then
and
with
the
help
of
hugh
sister
as
an
interpreter
i
took
down
what
he
said
return
from
old
woman
near
lough
more
where
father
patrick
was
drowned
who
used
to
make
her
living
by
selling
flax
at
the
market
was
by
the
and
often
came
back
afterwards
to
her
three
children
to
comb
their
hair
one
time
she
told
a
neighbour
that
the
money
she
saved
from
her
dealings
in
flax
would
be
found
near
a
big
rock
on
the
which
she
indicated
and
that
she
wanted
the
three
children
to
have
it
wife
recovered
from
the
man
young
wife
died
in
confinement
while
he
was
absent
on
some
business
at
ballingshaun
and
one
of
the
came
to
him
and
said
she
had
been
the
husband
hurried
home
and
that
night
he
sat
with
the
body
of
his
wife
all
alone
he
left
the
door
open
a
little
and
it
was
long
before
his
wife
spirit
came
in
and
went
to
the
cradle
where
her
child
was
sleeping
as
she
did
so
the
husband
threw
at
her
a
charm
of
hen
dung
which
he
had
ready
and
this
held
her
until
he
could
call
the
neighbours
and
while
they
were
coming
she
went
back
into
her
body
and
lived
a
long
time
afterwards
the
body
was
stiff
and
cold
when
the
husband
arrived
home
though
it
had
been
washed
or
dressed
a
tailor
testimony
our
next
witness
is
patrick
waters
by
trade
a
tailor
living
in
cloontipruckilish
a
hamlet
less
than
two
miles
from
hugh
currid
home
his
first
story
is
a
parallel
to
one
told
about
the
minister
of
aberfoyle
who
was
by
the
people
pp
ff
lost
girl
in
this
region
died
on
her
while
dancing
soon
after
her
death
she
appeared
to
her
husband
and
said
to
him
i
not
dead
at
all
but
i
am
put
from
you
now
for
a
time
it
may
be
a
long
time
or
a
short
time
i
can
not
tell
i
am
not
badly
off
if
you
want
to
get
me
back
you
must
stand
at
the
gap
near
the
house
and
catch
me
as
i
go
by
for
i
live
near
there
and
see
you
and
you
do
not
see
me
he
was
anxious
enough
to
get
her
back
and
did
waste
any
time
in
getting
to
the
gap
when
he
came
to
the
place
a
party
of
strangers
were
just
coming
out
and
his
wife
soon
appeared
as
plain
as
could
be
but
he
could
stir
a
hand
or
foot
to
save
her
then
there
was
a
scream
and
she
was
gone
the
man
firmly
believed
this
and
would
not
marry
again
invisible
is
an
enchanted
island
which
is
an
invisible
island
between
innishmurray
and
the
mainland
opposite
it
is
only
seen
once
in
seven
years
i
saw
it
myself
and
so
did
four
or
five
others
with
me
a
boatman
from
sligo
named
carr
took
two
strange
men
with
him
towards
innishmurray
and
they
disappeared
at
the
spot
where
the
island
is
and
he
thought
they
had
fallen
overboard
and
been
drowned
carr
saw
one
of
the
same
men
in
connelly
county
donegal
some
six
months
or
so
after
and
with
great
surprise
said
to
him
will
you
tell
me
the
wonders
of
the
world
is
it
you
i
saw
drowned
near
innishmurray
yes
he
said
and
then
asked
do
you
see
me
yes
answered
carr
but
said
the
man
again
you
do
not
see
me
with
both
eyes
then
carr
closed
one
eye
to
be
sure
and
found
that
he
saw
him
with
one
eye
only
and
he
told
the
man
which
one
it
was
at
this
information
the
fairy
man
blew
on
carr
face
and
carr
never
saw
him
again
father
dreamt
he
saw
two
armies
coming
in
from
the
sea
walking
on
the
water
reaching
the
strand
they
lined
up
and
commenced
a
battle
and
my
father
was
in
great
terror
the
fighting
was
long
and
bloody
and
when
it
was
over
every
fighter
vanished
the
wounded
and
dead
as
well
as
the
survivors
the
next
morning
an
old
woman
who
had
the
reputation
of
talking
with
the
fairies
came
in
the
house
to
my
father
who
though
greatly
disturbed
over
the
dream
had
told
us
nothing
of
it
and
asked
him
have
you
anything
to
tell
i
could
but
laugh
at
you
she
added
and
before
my
father
could
reply
continued
well
jimmy
you
wo
tell
the
news
so
i
will
and
then
she
began
to
tell
about
the
battle
ketty
exclaimed
my
father
at
this
can
it
be
true
and
who
were
the
men
beside
me
when
ketty
told
him
they
turned
out
to
be
some
of
his
dead
friends
she
received
her
information
from
a
drowned
man
whom
she
met
on
the
spot
where
the
armies
had
come
ashore
and
in
the
place
where
they
fought
the
sand
was
all
burnt
red
as
from
fire
as
the
narrator
reflected
on
this
dream
story
he
remarked
about
dreams
generally
reason
our
dreams
appear
different
from
what
they
are
is
because
while
in
them
we
ca
touch
the
body
and
transform
it
people
believe
themselves
to
be
with
the
dead
in
dreams
during
september
when
i
had
several
fresh
interviews
with
patrick
waters
i
verified
all
of
his
testimony
such
as
it
appears
above
and
among
unimportant
anecdotes
i
have
omitted
from
the
matter
taken
down
in
one
anecdote
about
our
from
county
sligo
because
it
proved
to
be
capable
of
opposite
interpretations
patrick
waters
however
like
many
of
his
neighbours
thoroughly
supports
hugh
currid
opinion
that
our
sees
something
and
it
must
be
the
and
of
hugh
currid
himself
patrick
waters
said
currid
did
surely
see
the
he
saw
them
passing
this
way
like
a
blast
of
wind
patrick
fresh
testimony
now
follows
the
story
about
father
patrick
and
father
dominick
coming
first
patrick
and
father
patrick
noan
while
bathing
in
the
harbour
at
carns
about
three
miles
of
grange
was
drowned
his
body
was
soon
brought
ashore
and
his
brother
father
dominick
noan
was
sent
for
when
father
dominick
arrived
one
of
the
men
who
had
collected
around
the
body
said
to
him
why
do
you
do
something
for
your
brother
patrick
why
do
somebody
ask
me
he
replied
for
i
must
be
asked
in
the
name
of
god
so
jimmy
mcgowan
went
on
his
knees
and
asked
for
the
honour
of
god
that
father
dominick
should
bring
father
patrick
back
to
life
and
at
this
father
dominick
took
out
his
breviary
and
began
to
read
after
a
time
he
whistled
and
began
to
read
again
he
whistled
a
second
time
and
returned
to
the
reading
upon
his
whistling
the
third
time
father
patrick
spirit
appeared
in
the
doorway
where
were
you
when
i
whistled
the
first
time
father
dominick
asked
i
was
at
a
hurling
match
with
the
on
mulloughmore
strand
and
where
were
you
at
the
second
whistle
i
was
coming
over
corrick
fadda
and
when
you
whistled
the
third
time
i
was
here
at
the
door
father
patrick
spirit
had
gone
back
into
the
body
and
father
patrick
lived
round
here
as
a
priest
for
a
long
time
afterwards
was
no
such
thing
as
artificial
respiration
known
hereabouts
when
this
happened
some
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
i
heard
this
story
which
i
know
is
true
from
many
persons
who
saw
father
dominick
restore
his
brother
to
life
druid
after
this
strange
psychical
narrative
there
followed
the
most
weird
legend
i
have
heard
in
celtic
lands
about
druids
and
magic
one
afternoon
patrick
waters
pointed
out
to
me
the
field
near
the
opposite
innishmurray
in
which
the
ancient
menhir
containing
the
used
to
stand
and
at
another
time
he
said
that
a
bronze
wand
covered
with
curious
marks
or
else
interlaced
designs
was
found
not
far
from
the
ruined
dolmen
and
on
the
farm
of
patrick
bruan
about
two
miles
southward
this
last
statement
like
the
story
itself
i
have
been
unable
to
verify
in
any
way
times
before
christ
there
were
druids
here
who
enchanted
one
another
with
druid
rods
made
of
brass
and
metamorphosed
one
another
into
stone
and
lumps
of
oak
the
question
is
where
are
the
spirits
of
these
druids
now
their
spirits
are
wafted
through
the
air
and
the
man
or
beast
they
meet
is
smitten
while
their
own
bodies
are
still
under
enchantment
i
had
such
a
druid
enchantment
in
my
hand
it
was
stone
nor
marble
nor
flint
and
had
human
shape
it
was
found
in
the
centre
of
a
big
rock
on
and
round
this
rock
light
used
to
appear
at
night
the
man
who
owned
the
stone
decided
to
blast
it
up
and
he
found
at
its
centre
the
enchantment
just
like
a
man
with
head
and
legs
and
arms
father
healy
took
the
enchantment
away
when
he
was
here
on
a
visit
and
said
that
it
was
a
druid
enchanted
and
that
to
get
out
of
the
rock
was
one
part
of
the
releasement
and
that
there
would
be
a
second
and
complete
releasement
of
the
druid
fairy
tribes
finally
i
asked
patrick
to
classify
as
far
as
he
could
all
the
fairy
tribes
he
had
ever
heard
about
and
he
said
leprechaun
is
a
fellow
who
stays
round
pure
springs
generally
shoemaking
for
the
rest
of
the
fairy
tribes
the
lunantishees
are
the
tribes
that
guard
the
blackthorn
trees
or
sloes
they
let
you
cut
no
stick
on
the
eleventh
of
november
the
original
november
day
or
on
the
eleventh
of
may
the
original
may
day
if
at
such
a
time
you
cut
a
blackthorn
some
misfortune
will
come
to
you
pookas
are
fellows
mounted
on
good
horses
and
are
they
visit
racecourses
but
usually
are
invisible
the
are
the
most
noble
tribe
of
all
and
they
are
a
big
race
who
came
from
the
planets
according
to
my
idea
they
usually
appear
white
the
though
there
is
some
doubt
the
same
or
almost
the
same
as
the
were
next
to
heaven
at
the
fall
but
did
not
fall
they
are
a
people
expecting
salvation
bridget
testimony
our
next
witness
is
bridget
a
near
neighbour
to
patrick
waters
in
cloontipruckilish
when
i
approached
her
neat
little
cottage
she
was
cutting
blossoms
with
a
pair
of
scissors
and
as
i
stopped
to
tell
her
how
pretty
a
garden
she
had
she
searched
out
the
finest
white
bloom
she
could
find
and
gave
it
to
me
after
we
had
talked
a
little
while
about
america
and
ireland
she
said
i
must
come
in
and
rest
a
few
minutes
and
so
i
did
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
talking
about
fairies
irish
legend
of
the
peggy
gillin
dead
these
thirty
years
who
lived
a
mile
beyond
grange
used
to
cure
people
with
a
secret
herb
shown
to
her
by
her
brother
dead
of
a
he
was
drowned
and
by
the
fairies
in
the
big
drowning
here
during
the
herring
season
she
would
pull
the
herb
herself
and
prepare
it
by
mixing
spring
water
with
it
peggy
could
always
talk
with
her
dead
relatives
and
friends
and
continually
with
her
brother
and
she
would
tell
everybody
that
they
were
with
the
fairies
her
daughter
mary
short
who
inherited
some
of
her
mother
power
died
here
about
three
or
four
years
ago
remember
too
about
mary
leonard
and
her
daughter
nancy
waters
both
of
them
are
dead
now
the
daughter
was
the
first
to
die
as
it
happened
and
in
when
she
was
gone
her
mother
used
to
wail
and
cry
in
an
awful
manner
and
one
day
the
daughter
appeared
to
her
in
the
garden
and
said
the
more
you
wail
for
me
the
more
i
am
in
torment
pray
for
me
but
do
not
wail
midwife
country
nurse
was
requested
by
a
strange
man
on
horseback
to
go
with
him
to
exercise
her
profession
and
she
went
with
him
to
a
castle
she
did
know
when
the
baby
was
born
every
woman
in
the
place
where
the
event
happened
put
her
finger
in
a
basin
of
water
and
rubbed
her
eyes
and
so
the
nurse
put
her
finger
in
and
rubbed
it
on
one
of
her
eyes
she
went
home
and
thought
no
more
about
it
but
one
day
she
was
at
the
fair
in
grange
and
saw
some
of
the
same
women
who
were
in
the
castle
when
the
baby
was
born
though
as
she
noticed
she
only
could
see
them
with
the
one
eye
she
had
wet
with
the
water
from
the
basin
the
nurse
spoke
to
the
women
and
they
wanted
to
know
how
she
recognized
them
and
she
in
reply
said
it
was
with
the
one
eye
and
asked
how
is
the
baby
well
said
one
of
the
fairy
women
and
what
eye
do
you
see
us
with
with
the
left
eye
answered
the
nurse
then
the
fairy
woman
blew
her
breath
against
the
nurse
left
eye
and
said
you
never
see
me
again
and
the
nurse
was
always
blind
in
the
left
eye
after
that
the
spirit
world
at
carns
the
carns
or
mount
temple
country
about
three
miles
from
grange
county
sligo
has
already
been
mentioned
by
witnesses
as
a
haunt
and
so
now
we
shall
hear
what
one
of
its
oldest
and
most
intelligent
native
inhabitants
says
of
it
john
mccann
had
been
referred
to
by
patrick
waters
as
one
who
knows
much
about
the
at
first
hand
and
we
can
be
sure
that
what
he
offers
us
is
thoroughly
reliable
evidence
for
many
years
john
mccann
born
in
by
profession
a
carpenter
and
has
been
official
to
innishmurray
and
he
knows
quite
as
much
about
the
strange
little
island
and
the
mainland
opposite
it
as
any
man
living
his
neat
little
cottage
is
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
opposite
the
beautiful
darnish
island
and
as
we
sat
within
it
beside
a
brilliant
peat
fire
and
surrounded
by
all
the
family
this
is
what
was
told
me
rourk
or
queenan
could
tell
all
that
would
happen
funerals
weddings
and
so
forth
sure
some
spirits
were
coming
to
her
she
said
they
were
the
that
the
are
everywhere
and
that
my
drowned
uncles
and
grandfather
and
other
dead
are
among
them
a
drowned
man
named
pat
nicholson
was
her
adviser
he
used
to
live
just
a
mile
from
here
and
she
knew
him
before
he
was
drowned
here
we
have
clearly
enough
a
case
of
or
of
communication
with
the
dead
as
in
modern
spiritualism
and
the
following
story
which
like
this
last
has
numerous
irish
parallels
illustrates
an
ancient
and
animistic
belief
that
in
sickness
as
in
dreams
the
soul
goes
out
of
the
body
as
at
death
and
meets
the
dead
in
their
own
fairy
world
clairvoyance
of
mike
farrell
too
could
tell
all
about
the
as
he
lay
sick
a
long
time
and
he
told
about
father
brannan
youth
and
even
the
house
in
roscommon
in
which
the
father
was
born
and
father
brannan
never
said
anything
more
against
mike
after
that
mike
surely
saw
the
and
he
was
with
them
during
his
illness
for
twelve
months
he
said
they
live
in
and
at
alt
darby
the
big
rock
after
he
got
well
he
went
to
america
at
the
time
of
the
famine
were
believed
to
live
up
on
this
hill
hill
of
the
brocket
stones
and
from
it
they
would
come
out
like
an
army
and
march
along
the
road
to
the
strand
very
few
persons
could
see
them
they
were
thought
to
be
like
living
people
but
in
different
dress
they
seemed
like
soldiers
yet
it
was
known
they
were
not
living
beings
such
as
we
are
seership
of
dan
connor
island
about
two
miles
southward
from
carns
by
the
mainland
my
uncle
dan
quinn
often
used
to
see
big
crowds
of
the
come
into
his
house
and
play
music
and
dance
the
house
would
be
full
of
them
but
they
caused
him
no
fear
once
on
such
an
occasion
one
of
them
came
up
to
him
as
he
lay
in
bed
and
giving
him
a
green
leaf
told
him
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
when
he
did
this
instantly
he
could
not
see
the
but
could
still
hear
their
music
uncle
dan
always
believed
he
recognized
in
some
of
the
his
drowned
friends
only
when
he
was
alone
would
the
visit
him
he
was
a
silent
old
man
and
so
never
talked
much
but
i
know
that
this
story
is
as
true
as
can
be
and
that
the
always
took
an
interest
in
him
under
the
shadow
of
ben
bulbin
and
ben
waskin
i
was
driving
along
the
ben
bulbin
road
on
the
ocean
side
with
michael
oates
who
was
on
his
way
from
his
home
to
the
lowlands
to
cut
hay
and
as
we
looked
up
at
the
ancient
mountain
so
mysterious
and
silent
in
the
shadows
and
fog
of
a
calm
early
morning
of
summer
he
told
me
about
its
invisible
inhabitants
knew
a
man
who
saw
the
hunting
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
he
saw
hounds
and
horsemen
cross
the
road
and
jump
the
hedge
in
front
of
him
and
it
was
one
at
night
the
next
day
he
passed
the
place
again
and
looked
for
the
tracks
of
the
huntsmen
but
saw
not
a
trace
of
tracks
at
all
of
the
after
i
had
heard
about
two
boys
who
were
drowned
opposite
innishmurray
and
who
afterwards
appeared
as
apparitions
for
the
had
them
this
curious
story
was
related
man
was
cutting
turf
out
on
the
side
of
ben
bulbin
when
a
strange
man
came
to
him
and
said
you
have
cut
enough
turf
for
you
had
better
stop
and
go
home
the
looked
around
in
surprise
and
in
two
seconds
the
strange
man
had
disappeared
but
he
decided
to
go
home
and
as
soon
as
he
was
home
such
a
feeling
came
over
him
that
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
then
he
took
to
his
bed
and
never
rose
again
the
at
this
michael
said
to
his
companion
in
the
cart
with
us
william
barber
tell
how
you
heard
the
music
and
this
followed
dark
night
about
one
myself
and
another
young
man
were
passing
along
the
road
up
there
round
ben
bulbin
when
we
heard
the
finest
kind
of
music
all
sorts
of
music
seemed
to
be
playing
we
could
see
nothing
at
all
though
we
thought
we
heard
voices
like
children
it
was
the
music
of
the
we
heard
my
next
friend
to
testify
is
pat
ruddy
eighty
years
old
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
prosperous
farmers
living
beside
ben
bulbin
he
greeted
me
in
the
true
irish
way
but
before
we
could
come
to
talk
about
fairies
his
good
wife
induced
me
to
enter
another
room
where
she
had
secretly
prepared
a
great
feast
spread
out
on
a
fresh
white
cloth
while
pat
and
myself
had
been
exchanging
opinions
about
america
and
ireland
when
i
returned
to
the
kitchen
the
whole
family
were
assembled
round
the
blazing
turf
fire
and
pat
was
soon
talking
about
the
the
people
used
to
say
the
were
in
the
mountains
that
is
certain
but
i
never
could
be
quite
sure
of
it
myself
one
night
however
near
midnight
i
did
have
a
sight
i
set
out
from
bantrillick
to
come
home
and
near
ben
bulbin
there
was
the
greatest
army
you
ever
saw
five
or
six
thousand
of
them
in
armour
shining
in
the
moonlight
a
strange
man
rose
out
of
the
hedge
and
stopped
me
for
a
minute
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
looked
into
my
face
and
then
let
me
go
ossianic
man
went
away
with
the
or
and
returned
to
find
the
townland
all
in
ruins
as
he
came
back
riding
on
a
horse
of
the
he
saw
some
men
in
a
quarry
trying
to
move
a
big
stone
he
helped
them
with
it
but
his
broke
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
the
horse
ran
away
and
he
was
left
there
an
old
man
cf
pp
a
schoolmaster
testimony
a
schoolmaster
who
is
a
native
of
the
ben
bulbin
country
offers
this
testimony
is
implicit
belief
here
in
the
especially
among
the
old
people
they
consider
them
the
spirits
of
their
departed
relations
and
friends
who
visit
them
in
joy
and
in
sorrow
on
the
death
of
a
member
of
a
family
they
believe
the
spirits
of
their
near
relatives
are
present
they
do
not
see
them
but
feel
their
presence
they
even
have
a
strong
belief
that
the
spirits
show
them
the
future
in
dreams
and
say
that
cases
of
affliction
are
always
foreshown
in
a
dream
belief
in
changelings
is
not
now
generally
prevalent
but
in
olden
times
a
mother
used
to
place
a
pair
of
iron
tongs
over
the
cradle
before
leaving
the
child
alone
in
order
that
the
fairies
should
not
change
the
child
for
a
weakly
one
of
their
own
it
was
another
custom
to
take
a
wisp
of
straw
and
lighting
one
end
of
it
make
a
fiery
sign
of
the
cross
over
a
cradle
before
a
babe
could
be
placed
in
it
with
the
irish
mystics
in
the
world
let
us
now
turn
to
the
rosses
point
country
which
as
we
have
already
said
is
one
of
the
very
famous
places
for
seeing
the
or
as
educated
irish
seers
who
make
pilgrimages
thither
call
them
the
i
have
been
told
by
more
than
one
such
seer
that
there
on
the
hills
and
greenlands
a
great
stretch
of
open
country
treeless
and
and
on
the
strand
at
lower
rosses
point
called
wren
point
by
the
these
beings
can
be
seen
and
their
wonderful
music
heard
and
a
irish
artist
has
shown
me
many
drawings
and
paintings
in
oil
of
these
people
as
he
has
often
beheld
them
at
those
places
and
elsewhere
in
ireland
they
are
described
as
a
race
of
majestic
appearance
and
marvellous
beauty
in
form
human
yet
in
nature
divine
the
highest
order
of
them
seems
to
be
a
race
of
beings
evolved
to
a
superhuman
plane
of
existence
such
as
the
ancients
called
gods
and
with
this
opinion
strange
as
it
may
seem
in
this
age
all
the
educated
irish
seers
with
whom
i
have
been
privileged
to
talk
agree
though
they
go
further
and
say
that
these
highest
races
still
inhabiting
ireland
are
the
immortal
divine
race
known
to
the
ancient
men
of
erin
as
the
tuatha
de
danann
of
all
european
lands
i
venture
to
say
that
ireland
is
the
most
mystical
and
in
the
eyes
of
true
irishmen
as
much
the
magic
island
of
gods
and
initiates
now
as
it
was
when
the
sacred
fires
flashed
from
its
purple
and
mysterious
round
towers
and
the
greater
mysteries
drew
to
its
hallowed
shrines
neophytes
from
the
west
as
well
as
from
the
east
from
india
and
egypt
as
well
as
from
atlantis
and
erin
sons
still
watch
and
wait
for
the
relighting
of
the
fires
and
the
restoration
of
the
old
druidic
mysteries
herein
i
but
imperfectly
echo
the
mystic
message
seers
gave
me
a
pilgrim
to
their
sacred
isle
and
until
this
mystic
message
is
interpreted
men
can
not
discover
the
secret
of
gaelic
myth
and
song
in
olden
or
in
modern
times
they
can
not
drink
at
the
fountain
of
gaelic
genius
the
perennial
source
of
inspiration
which
lies
behind
the
new
revival
of
literature
and
art
in
ireland
nor
understand
the
seeming
reality
of
the
fairy
races
an
irish
mystic
testimony
through
the
kindness
of
an
irish
mystic
who
is
a
seer
i
am
enabled
to
present
here
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
very
rare
and
very
important
evidence
which
will
serve
to
illustrate
and
to
confirm
what
has
just
been
said
above
about
the
mysticism
of
ireland
to
anthropologists
this
evidence
may
be
of
more
than
ordinary
value
when
they
know
that
it
comes
from
one
who
is
not
only
a
cultured
seer
but
who
is
also
a
man
conspicuously
successful
in
the
practical
life
of
a
great
city
are
all
visions
which
you
have
had
of
the
same
character
have
always
made
a
distinction
between
pictures
seen
in
the
memory
of
nature
and
visions
of
actual
beings
now
existing
in
the
inner
world
we
can
make
the
same
distinction
in
our
world
i
may
close
my
eyes
and
see
you
as
a
vivid
picture
in
memory
or
i
may
look
at
you
with
my
physical
eyes
and
see
your
actual
image
in
seeing
these
beings
of
which
i
speak
the
physical
eyes
may
be
open
or
closed
mystical
beings
in
their
own
world
and
nature
are
never
seen
with
the
physical
eyes
by
the
inner
world
do
you
mean
the
celtic
otherworld
though
there
are
many
otherworlds
the
of
the
ancient
irish
in
which
the
races
of
the
exist
may
be
described
as
a
radiant
archetype
of
this
world
though
this
definition
does
not
at
all
express
its
psychic
nature
in
one
sees
nothing
save
harmony
and
beautiful
forms
there
are
other
worlds
in
which
we
can
see
horrible
shapes
of
the
do
you
in
any
way
classify
the
races
to
which
you
refer
beings
whom
i
call
the
i
divide
as
i
have
seen
them
into
two
great
classes
those
which
are
shining
and
those
which
are
opalescent
and
seem
lit
up
by
a
light
within
themselves
the
shining
beings
appear
to
be
lower
in
the
hierarchies
the
opalescent
beings
are
more
rarely
seen
and
appear
to
hold
the
positions
of
great
chiefs
or
princes
among
the
tribes
of
dana
of
under
what
state
or
condition
and
where
have
you
seen
such
beings
have
seen
them
most
frequently
after
being
away
from
a
city
or
town
for
a
few
days
the
whole
west
coast
of
ireland
from
donegal
to
kerry
seems
charged
with
a
magical
power
and
i
find
it
easiest
to
see
while
i
am
there
i
have
always
found
it
comparatively
easy
to
see
visions
while
at
ancient
monuments
like
new
grange
and
dowth
because
i
think
such
places
are
naturally
charged
with
psychical
forces
and
were
for
that
reason
made
use
of
long
ago
as
sacred
places
i
usually
find
it
possible
to
throw
myself
into
the
mood
of
seeing
but
sometimes
visions
have
forced
themselves
upon
me
shining
can
you
describe
the
shining
beings
is
very
difficult
to
give
any
intelligible
description
of
them
the
first
time
i
saw
them
with
great
vividness
i
was
lying
on
a
alone
in
the
west
of
ireland
in
county
sligo
i
had
been
listening
to
music
in
the
air
and
to
what
seemed
to
be
the
sound
of
bells
and
was
trying
to
understand
these
aerial
clashings
in
which
wind
seemed
to
break
upon
wind
in
an
musical
silvery
sound
then
the
space
before
me
grew
luminous
and
i
began
to
see
one
beautiful
being
after
another
opalescent
can
you
describe
one
of
the
opalescent
beings
first
of
these
i
saw
i
remember
very
clearly
and
the
manner
of
its
appearance
there
was
at
first
a
dazzle
of
light
and
then
i
saw
that
this
came
from
the
heart
of
a
tall
figure
with
a
body
apparently
shaped
out
of
or
opalescent
air
and
throughout
the
body
ran
a
radiant
electrical
fire
to
which
the
heart
seemed
the
centre
around
the
head
of
this
being
and
through
its
waving
luminous
hair
which
was
blown
all
about
the
body
like
living
strands
of
gold
there
appeared
flaming
auras
from
the
being
itself
light
seemed
to
stream
outwards
in
every
direction
and
the
effect
left
on
me
after
the
vision
was
one
of
extraordinary
lightness
joyousness
or
ecstasy
about
this
same
period
of
my
life
i
saw
many
of
these
great
beings
and
i
then
thought
that
i
had
visions
of
aengus
manannan
lug
and
other
famous
kings
or
princes
among
the
tuatha
de
danann
but
since
then
i
have
seen
so
many
beings
of
a
similar
character
that
i
now
no
longer
would
attribute
to
any
one
of
them
personal
identity
with
particular
beings
of
legend
though
i
believe
that
they
correspond
in
a
general
way
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
ancient
irish
gods
of
the
you
speak
of
the
opalescent
beings
as
great
beings
what
stature
do
you
assign
to
them
and
to
the
shining
beings
opalescent
beings
seem
to
be
about
fourteen
feet
in
stature
though
i
do
not
know
why
i
attribute
to
them
such
definite
height
since
i
had
nothing
to
compare
them
with
but
i
have
always
considered
them
as
much
taller
than
our
race
the
shining
beings
seem
to
be
about
our
own
stature
or
just
a
little
taller
peasant
and
other
irish
seers
do
not
usually
speak
of
the
as
being
little
but
as
being
tall
an
old
schoolmaster
in
the
west
of
ireland
described
them
to
me
from
his
own
visions
as
tall
beautiful
people
and
he
used
some
gaelic
words
which
i
took
as
meaning
that
they
were
shining
with
every
colour
worlds
of
the
do
the
two
orders
of
beings
inhabit
the
same
world
shining
beings
belong
to
the
while
the
opalescent
beings
belong
to
the
there
are
three
great
worlds
which
we
can
see
while
we
are
still
in
the
body
the
and
of
the
do
you
consider
the
life
and
state
of
these
beings
superior
to
the
life
and
state
of
men
could
never
decide
one
can
say
that
they
themselves
are
certainly
more
beautiful
than
men
are
and
that
their
worlds
seem
more
beautiful
than
our
world
the
shining
orders
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
individualized
life
thus
if
one
of
them
raises
his
hands
all
raise
their
hands
and
if
one
drinks
from
a
all
do
they
seem
to
move
and
to
have
their
real
existence
in
a
being
higher
than
themselves
to
which
they
are
a
kind
of
body
theirs
is
i
think
a
collective
life
so
unindividualized
and
so
calm
that
i
might
have
more
varied
thoughts
in
five
hours
than
they
would
have
in
five
years
and
yet
one
feels
an
extraordinary
purity
and
exaltation
about
their
life
beauty
of
form
with
them
has
never
been
broken
up
by
the
passions
which
arise
in
the
developed
egotism
of
human
beings
a
hive
of
bees
has
been
described
as
a
single
organism
with
disconnected
cells
and
some
of
these
tribes
of
shining
beings
seem
to
be
little
more
than
one
being
manifesting
itself
in
many
beautiful
forms
i
speak
this
with
reference
to
the
shining
beings
only
i
think
that
among
the
opalescent
or
beings
in
the
there
is
an
even
closer
spiritual
unity
but
also
a
greater
individuality
of
the
on
do
you
consider
any
of
these
beings
inimical
to
humanity
kinds
of
the
shining
beings
whom
i
call
wood
beings
have
never
affected
me
with
any
evil
influences
i
could
recognize
but
the
water
beings
also
of
the
shining
tribes
i
always
dread
because
i
felt
whenever
i
came
into
contact
with
them
a
great
drowsiness
of
mind
and
i
often
thought
an
actual
drawing
away
of
vitality
beings
can
you
describe
one
of
these
water
beings
the
world
under
the
waters
under
a
lake
in
the
west
of
ireland
in
this
case
i
saw
a
blue
and
orange
coloured
king
seated
on
a
throne
and
there
seemed
to
be
some
fountain
of
mystical
fire
rising
from
under
his
throne
and
he
breathed
this
fire
into
himself
as
though
it
were
his
life
as
i
looked
i
saw
groups
of
pale
beings
almost
grey
in
colour
coming
down
one
side
of
the
throne
by
the
they
placed
their
head
and
lips
near
the
heart
of
the
elemental
king
and
then
as
they
touched
him
they
shot
upwards
plumed
and
radiant
and
passed
on
the
other
side
as
though
they
had
received
a
new
life
from
this
chief
of
their
world
beings
can
you
describe
one
of
the
wood
beings
wood
beings
i
have
seen
most
often
are
of
a
shining
silvery
colour
with
a
tinge
of
blue
or
pale
violet
and
with
dark
hair
and
immortality
of
the
do
you
consider
the
races
of
the
able
to
reproduce
their
kind
and
are
they
immortal
higher
kinds
seem
capable
of
breathing
forth
beings
out
of
themselves
but
i
do
not
understand
how
they
do
so
i
have
seen
some
of
them
who
contain
elemental
beings
within
themselves
and
these
they
could
send
out
and
receive
back
within
themselves
again
immortality
ascribed
to
them
by
the
ancient
irish
is
only
a
relative
immortality
their
space
of
life
being
much
greater
than
ours
in
time
however
i
believe
that
they
grow
old
and
then
pass
into
new
bodies
just
as
men
do
but
whether
by
birth
or
by
the
growth
of
a
new
body
i
can
not
say
since
i
have
no
certain
knowledge
about
this
among
the
does
sexual
differentiation
seem
to
prevail
among
the
sidhe
races
have
seen
forms
both
male
and
female
and
forms
which
did
not
suggest
sex
at
all
and
human
is
it
possible
as
the
ancient
irish
thought
that
certain
of
the
higher
beings
have
entered
or
could
enter
our
plane
of
life
by
submitting
to
human
birth
on
the
other
hand
do
you
consider
it
possible
for
men
in
trance
or
at
death
to
enter
the
world
can
not
say
both
in
trance
and
after
death
i
think
any
one
who
thought
much
of
the
during
his
life
and
who
saw
them
frequently
and
brooded
on
them
would
likely
go
to
their
world
after
death
organization
of
the
you
refer
to
or
beings
and
to
a
king
among
water
beings
is
there
therefore
definite
social
organization
among
the
various
orders
and
races
and
if
so
what
is
its
nature
can
not
say
about
a
definite
social
organization
i
have
seen
beings
who
seemed
to
command
others
and
who
were
held
in
reverence
this
implies
an
organization
but
whether
it
is
instinctive
like
that
of
a
hive
of
bees
or
consciously
organized
like
human
society
i
can
not
say
as
nature
you
speak
of
the
king
as
an
elemental
king
do
you
suggest
thereby
a
resemblance
between
lower
orders
and
what
mediaeval
mystics
called
elementals
lower
orders
of
the
are
i
think
the
nature
elementals
of
the
mediaeval
mystics
of
the
higher
the
water
beings
as
you
have
described
them
seem
to
be
nourished
and
kept
alive
by
something
akin
to
electrical
fluids
do
the
higher
orders
of
the
seem
to
be
similarly
nourished
seemed
to
me
to
draw
their
life
out
of
the
soul
of
the
world
visions
of
have
you
had
visions
of
the
various
beings
in
company
with
other
persons
have
had
such
visions
on
several
occasions
and
this
statement
has
been
confirmed
to
me
by
three
participants
in
such
collective
visions
who
separately
at
different
times
have
seen
in
company
with
our
witness
the
same
vision
at
the
same
moment
on
another
occasion
on
the
greenlands
at
rosses
point
county
sligo
the
same
being
was
seen
by
our
present
witness
and
a
friend
with
him
also
possessing
the
faculty
of
seership
at
a
time
when
the
two
percipients
were
some
little
distance
apart
and
they
hurried
to
each
other
to
describe
the
being
not
knowing
that
the
explanation
was
mutually
unnecessary
i
have
talked
with
both
percipients
so
much
and
know
them
so
intimately
that
i
am
fully
able
to
state
that
as
percipients
they
fulfil
all
necessary
pathological
conditions
required
by
psychologists
in
order
to
make
their
evidence
acceptable
parallel
evidence
as
to
the
races
in
general
the
rare
evidence
above
recorded
from
the
irish
seer
could
be
paralleled
by
similar
evidence
from
at
least
two
other
reliable
irish
people
with
whom
also
i
have
been
privileged
to
discuss
the
one
is
a
member
of
the
royal
irish
academy
the
other
is
the
wife
of
a
irish
historian
and
both
of
them
testify
to
having
likewise
had
collective
visions
of
beings
in
ireland
this
is
what
william
yeats
wrote
to
me
while
this
study
was
in
progress
concerning
the
celtic
fairy
kingdom
am
certain
that
it
exists
and
will
some
day
be
studied
as
it
was
studied
by
kirk
independent
evidence
from
the
world
one
of
the
most
remarkable
discoveries
of
our
celtic
researches
has
been
that
the
native
population
of
the
rosses
point
country
or
as
we
have
called
it
the
world
in
most
essentials
and
what
is
most
important
by
independent
substantiate
the
opinions
and
statements
of
the
educated
irish
mystics
to
whom
we
have
just
referred
as
follows
conway
vision
of
the
in
upper
rosses
point
conway
told
me
this
about
the
conway
my
husband
who
was
a
pilot
by
profession
in
watching
for
ships
used
to
go
up
on
the
high
hill
among
the
fairy
hills
and
there
he
often
saw
the
going
down
the
hill
to
the
strand
one
night
in
particular
he
recognized
them
as
men
and
women
of
the
and
they
were
as
big
as
any
living
people
it
was
late
at
night
about
forty
years
ago
and
when
first
i
introduced
myself
to
owen
conway
in
his
bachelor
quarters
a
cosy
cottage
at
upper
rosses
point
he
said
that
yeats
and
other
men
famous
in
irish
literature
had
visited
him
to
hear
about
the
fairies
and
that
though
he
knew
very
little
about
the
fairies
he
nevertheless
always
likes
to
talk
of
them
then
owen
began
to
tell
me
about
a
man
ghost
which
both
he
and
bran
reggan
had
seen
at
different
times
on
the
road
to
sligo
then
about
a
woman
ghost
which
he
and
other
people
had
often
seen
near
where
we
were
and
then
about
the
exorcizing
of
a
haunted
house
in
sligo
some
sixty
years
ago
by
father
mcgowan
who
as
a
result
died
soon
afterwards
apparently
having
been
killed
by
the
exorcized
spirits
finally
i
heard
from
him
the
following
anecdotes
about
the
fairies
stone
wall
overthrown
by
is
more
certain
than
that
there
are
fairies
the
old
folks
always
thought
them
the
fallen
angels
at
the
back
of
this
house
the
fairies
had
their
pass
my
neighbour
started
to
build
a
and
one
wall
abutting
on
the
pass
was
thrown
down
twice
and
nothing
but
the
fairies
ever
did
it
the
third
time
the
wall
was
built
it
stood
passing
through
stone
macewen
house
stands
was
a
noted
fairy
place
men
in
building
the
house
saw
fairies
on
horses
coming
across
the
spot
and
the
stone
walls
did
not
stop
them
at
all
the
cousin
of
mine
who
was
a
pilot
once
went
to
the
up
there
on
the
point
to
take
his
brother
place
and
he
saw
ladies
coming
towards
him
as
he
crossed
the
greenlands
at
first
he
thought
they
were
coming
from
a
dance
but
there
was
no
dance
going
then
and
if
there
had
been
no
human
beings
dressed
like
them
and
moving
as
they
were
could
have
come
from
any
part
of
the
globe
and
in
so
great
a
party
at
that
hour
of
the
night
then
when
they
passed
him
and
he
saw
how
beautiful
they
were
he
knew
them
for
the
women
reddy
our
next
witness
saw
the
down
on
the
greenlands
in
regimentals
like
an
army
and
in
daylight
he
was
a
young
man
at
the
time
and
had
been
sent
out
to
see
if
any
cattle
were
astray
and
this
is
what
michael
reddy
of
rosses
point
now
a
sailor
on
the
ship
sailing
from
sligo
to
neighbouring
ports
on
the
irish
coast
asserts
in
confirmation
of
owen
conway
statement
about
him
saw
the
on
the
strand
at
lower
rosses
point
about
forty
years
ago
it
was
afternoon
i
first
saw
one
of
them
like
an
officer
pointing
at
me
what
seemed
a
sword
and
when
i
got
on
the
greenlands
i
saw
a
great
company
of
like
soldiers
in
red
laughing
and
shouting
their
leader
was
a
big
man
and
they
were
ordinary
human
size
as
a
result
of
this
vision
i
took
to
my
bed
and
lay
there
for
weeks
upon
another
occasion
late
at
night
i
was
with
my
mother
milking
cows
and
we
heard
the
all
round
us
talking
but
could
not
see
them
to
the
through
death
dreams
or
john
one
of
the
most
reliable
citizens
of
upper
rosses
point
offers
the
following
testimony
concerning
the
olden
times
the
were
very
numerous
about
and
here
on
the
greenlands
but
rarely
seen
they
appeared
to
be
the
same
as
any
living
men
when
people
died
it
was
said
the
took
them
for
they
would
afterwards
appear
among
the
had
a
ploughman
of
good
habits
who
came
in
one
day
too
late
for
his
morning
work
and
he
in
excuse
very
seriously
said
may
be
if
you
had
travelled
all
night
as
much
as
i
have
you
would
talk
i
was
away
with
the
and
save
for
a
lady
i
could
have
been
back
now
i
saw
a
long
hall
full
of
many
people
some
of
them
i
knew
and
some
i
did
not
know
the
lady
saved
me
by
telling
me
to
eat
no
food
there
however
enticing
it
might
be
young
man
at
drumcliffe
was
in
a
trance
state
and
was
with
the
some
time
and
then
got
back
another
man
whom
i
knew
well
was
haunted
by
the
for
a
long
time
and
he
often
went
off
with
apparently
in
a
dream
or
trance
state
the
story
which
now
follows
substantiates
the
testimony
of
cultured
irish
seers
that
at
lower
rosses
point
the
music
of
the
can
be
heard
women
were
gathering
in
the
month
of
march
on
the
lowest
point
of
the
strand
lower
rosses
or
wren
point
when
they
heard
the
most
beautiful
music
they
set
to
work
to
dance
with
it
and
danced
themselves
sick
they
then
thanked
the
invisible
musician
and
went
home
the
testimony
of
a
college
professor
our
next
witness
is
the
rev
father
a
professor
in
a
catholic
college
in
west
ireland
and
most
of
his
statements
are
based
on
events
which
happened
among
his
own
acquaintances
and
relatives
and
his
deductions
are
the
result
of
careful
investigation
from
twenty
to
thirty
years
ago
on
the
borders
of
county
roscommon
near
county
sligo
according
to
the
firm
belief
of
one
of
my
own
relatives
a
sister
of
his
was
by
the
fairies
on
her
and
she
appeared
to
her
mother
afterwards
as
an
apparition
she
seemed
to
want
to
speak
but
her
mother
who
was
in
bed
at
the
time
was
thoroughly
frightened
and
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
the
mother
is
convinced
that
she
saw
this
apparition
of
her
daughter
and
my
relative
thinks
she
might
have
saved
her
same
relative
who
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
his
sister
was
by
the
fairies
at
a
different
time
saw
the
apparition
of
another
relative
of
mine
who
also
according
to
similar
belief
had
been
by
the
fairies
when
only
five
years
old
the
appeared
beside
its
living
sister
one
day
while
the
sister
was
going
from
the
yard
into
the
house
and
it
followed
her
in
it
is
said
the
child
was
because
she
was
such
a
good
girl
of
the
belief
in
children
we
were
always
afraid
of
fairies
and
were
taught
to
say
god
bless
god
bless
whenever
we
heard
them
mentioned
our
family
we
always
made
it
a
point
to
have
clean
water
in
the
house
at
night
for
the
fairies
anything
like
dirty
water
was
thrown
out
of
doors
after
dark
it
was
necessary
to
say
hugga
salach
as
a
warning
to
the
fairies
not
to
get
their
clothes
wet
food
like
milk
used
to
be
left
on
the
table
at
night
for
the
fairies
if
you
were
eating
and
food
fell
from
you
it
was
not
right
to
take
it
back
for
the
fairies
wanted
it
many
families
are
very
serious
about
this
even
now
the
luckiest
thing
to
do
in
such
cases
is
to
pick
up
the
food
and
eat
just
a
speck
of
it
and
then
throw
the
rest
away
to
the
fairies
and
apparitions
are
commonly
said
to
live
in
isolated
or
many
lonely
bushes
of
this
kind
have
their
ghosts
for
example
there
is
fanny
bush
sally
bush
and
another
i
know
of
in
county
sligo
near
boyle
fairies
of
any
one
race
are
the
people
of
the
preceding
race
the
fomors
for
the
fir
bolgs
the
fir
bolgs
for
the
dananns
and
the
dananns
for
us
the
old
races
died
where
did
they
go
they
became
spirits
and
fairies
gave
our
race
power
to
see
the
inner
world
when
christianity
came
to
ireland
the
people
had
no
heaven
before
their
ideas
about
the
other
world
were
vague
but
the
older
ideas
of
a
spirit
world
remained
side
by
side
with
the
christian
ones
and
being
preserved
in
a
subconscious
way
gave
rise
to
the
fairy
world
evidence
from
county
roscommon
our
next
place
for
investigation
will
be
the
ancient
province
of
the
great
meave
who
made
herself
famous
by
leading
against
cuchulainn
the
united
armies
of
four
of
the
five
provinces
of
ireland
and
all
on
account
of
a
bull
which
she
coveted
and
there
could
be
no
better
part
of
it
to
visit
than
roscommon
which
douglas
hyde
has
made
popular
in
irish
hyde
and
the
one
day
while
i
was
privileged
to
be
at
ratra
hyde
invited
me
to
walk
with
him
in
the
country
after
we
had
visited
an
old
which
belongs
to
the
people
and
had
noticed
some
other
of
their
haunts
in
that
part
of
queen
meave
realm
we
entered
a
cottage
on
the
roadside
and
found
the
good
and
her
daughter
both
at
home
in
response
to
hyde
inquiries
the
mother
stated
that
one
day
in
her
girlhood
near
a
hedge
from
which
she
was
gathering
wild
berries
she
saw
a
leprechaun
in
a
hole
under
a
stone
was
much
larger
than
a
doll
and
he
was
most
perfectly
formed
with
a
little
mouth
and
eyes
nothing
was
told
about
the
little
fellow
having
a
although
the
woman
said
people
told
her
afterwards
that
she
would
have
been
rich
if
she
had
only
had
sense
enough
to
catch
him
when
she
had
so
good
a
chance
death
the
next
tale
the
mother
told
was
about
the
death
coach
which
used
to
pass
by
the
very
house
we
were
in
every
night
until
after
her
daughter
was
born
she
used
to
rise
up
on
her
elbow
in
bed
to
listen
to
the
death
coach
passing
by
it
passed
about
midnight
and
she
could
hear
the
rushing
the
tramping
of
the
horses
and
most
beautiful
singing
just
like
fairy
music
but
she
could
not
understand
the
words
once
or
twice
she
was
brave
enough
to
open
the
door
and
look
out
as
the
coach
passed
but
she
could
never
see
a
thing
though
there
was
the
noise
and
singing
one
time
a
man
had
to
wait
on
the
roadside
to
let
the
fairy
horses
go
by
and
he
could
hear
their
passing
very
clearly
and
could
see
one
of
them
when
we
got
home
hyde
told
me
that
the
fairies
of
the
region
are
rarely
seen
the
people
usually
say
that
they
hear
or
feel
them
only
people
and
after
the
mother
had
testified
the
daughter
who
is
quite
of
the
younger
generation
gave
her
own
opinion
she
said
that
the
people
live
in
the
and
often
take
men
and
women
or
youths
who
pass
by
the
after
sunset
that
gilleran
who
died
not
long
ago
once
saw
certain
dead
friends
and
recognized
among
them
those
who
were
believed
to
have
been
and
those
who
died
naturally
and
that
he
saw
them
again
when
he
was
on
his
we
have
here
as
in
so
many
other
accounts
a
clear
connexion
between
the
realm
of
the
dead
and
fairyland
the
testimony
of
a
lough
derg
seer
neil
colton
years
old
who
lives
in
tamlach
townland
on
the
shores
of
lough
derg
county
donegal
has
a
local
reputation
for
having
seen
the
folk
and
so
i
called
upon
him
as
we
sat
round
his
blazing
turf
fire
and
in
the
midst
of
his
family
of
three
sturdy
boys
for
he
married
late
in
life
this
is
what
he
related
girl
recovered
from
day
just
before
sunset
in
midsummer
and
i
a
boy
then
my
brother
and
cousin
and
myself
were
gathering
bilberries
whortleberries
up
by
the
rocks
at
the
back
of
here
when
all
at
once
we
heard
music
we
hurried
round
the
rocks
and
there
we
were
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
six
or
eight
of
the
and
they
dancing
when
they
saw
us
a
little
woman
dressed
all
in
red
came
running
out
from
them
towards
us
and
she
struck
my
cousin
across
the
face
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
green
rush
we
ran
for
home
as
hard
as
we
could
and
when
my
cousin
reached
the
house
she
fell
dead
father
saddled
a
horse
and
went
for
father
ryan
when
father
ryan
arrived
he
put
a
stole
about
his
neck
and
began
praying
over
my
cousin
and
reading
psalms
and
striking
her
with
the
stole
and
in
that
way
brought
her
back
he
said
if
she
had
not
caught
hold
of
my
brother
she
would
have
been
for
ever
are
not
earthly
people
they
are
a
people
with
a
nature
of
their
own
even
in
the
water
there
are
men
and
women
of
the
same
character
others
have
caves
in
the
rocks
and
in
them
rooms
and
apartments
these
races
were
terribly
plentiful
a
hundred
years
ago
and
they
come
back
again
my
father
lived
two
miles
from
here
where
there
were
plenty
of
the
in
olden
times
they
used
to
take
young
folks
and
keep
them
and
draw
all
the
life
out
of
their
bodies
nobody
could
ever
tell
their
nature
exactly
evidence
from
county
fermanagh
from
james
summerville
years
old
who
lives
in
the
country
near
irvinestown
i
heard
much
about
the
people
and
about
banshees
and
then
the
following
remarkable
story
concerning
the
people
clairvoyance
through
near
ederney
county
fermanagh
about
seventy
years
ago
a
man
whom
i
knew
well
was
taken
to
america
on
hallow
eve
night
and
the
made
him
look
down
a
chimney
to
see
his
own
daughter
cooking
at
a
kitchen
fire
then
took
him
to
another
place
in
america
where
he
saw
a
friend
he
knew
the
next
morning
he
was
at
his
own
home
here
in
ireland
man
wrote
a
letter
to
his
daughter
to
know
if
she
was
at
the
place
and
at
the
work
on
hallow
eve
night
and
she
wrote
back
that
she
was
he
was
sure
that
it
was
the
who
had
taken
him
to
america
and
back
in
one
night
evidence
from
county
antrim
at
the
request
of
major
berry
of
richill
castle
armagh
higginson
of
glenavy
county
antrim
collected
all
the
material
he
could
find
concerning
the
in
his
part
of
county
antrim
and
sent
to
me
the
results
from
which
i
have
selected
the
very
interesting
and
in
some
respects
unique
tales
which
follow
fairies
and
the
judge
of
sophys
bridge
was
a
weaver
every
night
after
he
went
to
bed
the
weaving
started
of
itself
and
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
he
would
find
the
dressing
which
had
been
made
ready
for
weaving
so
broken
and
entangled
that
it
took
him
hours
to
put
it
right
yet
with
all
this
drawback
he
got
no
poorer
because
the
fairies
left
him
plenty
of
household
necessaries
and
whenever
he
sold
a
web
of
cloth
he
always
received
treble
the
amount
bargained
for
two
regiments
of
megarry
of
ballinderry
as
his
daughter
who
is
married
to
james
megarry
told
me
was
one
night
going
to
crumlin
on
horseback
for
a
doctor
when
after
passing
through
glenavy
he
met
just
opposite
the
vicarage
two
regiments
of
the
fairies
coming
along
the
road
towards
glenavy
one
regiment
was
dressed
in
red
and
one
in
blue
or
green
uniform
were
playing
music
but
when
they
opened
out
to
let
him
pass
through
the
middle
of
the
music
ceased
until
he
had
passed
by
in
cuchulainn
country
a
civil
engineer
testimony
in
the
heroic
days
of
pagan
ireland
as
tradition
tells
the
ancient
earthworks
now
called
the
navan
rings
just
outside
armagh
were
the
stronghold
of
cuchulainn
and
the
red
branch
knights
and
later
under
patrick
armagh
itself
one
of
the
old
mystic
centres
of
erin
became
the
ecclesiastical
capital
of
the
gaels
and
from
this
romantic
country
one
of
its
best
informed
native
sons
a
graduate
civil
engineer
of
dublin
university
offers
the
following
important
evidence
fairies
are
the
i
was
a
youngster
near
armagh
i
was
kept
good
by
being
told
that
the
fairies
could
take
bad
boys
away
the
sane
belief
about
the
fairies
however
is
different
as
i
discovered
when
i
grew
up
the
old
people
in
county
armagh
seriously
believe
that
the
fairies
are
the
spirits
of
the
dead
and
they
say
that
if
you
have
many
friends
deceased
you
have
many
friendly
fairies
or
if
you
have
many
enemies
deceased
you
have
many
fairies
looking
out
to
do
you
harm
to
was
very
usual
formerly
and
the
practice
is
not
yet
given
up
to
place
a
bed
some
other
furniture
and
plenty
of
food
in
a
dwelling
the
night
before
the
time
fixed
for
moving
into
it
and
if
the
food
is
not
consumed
and
the
crumbs
swept
up
by
the
door
in
the
morning
the
house
can
not
safely
be
occupied
i
know
of
two
houses
now
that
have
never
been
occupied
because
the
fairies
did
not
show
their
willingness
and
goodwill
by
taking
food
so
offered
to
them
on
the
slopes
of
slieve
gullion
in
climbing
to
the
summit
of
cuchulainn
mountain
which
overlooks
parts
of
the
territory
made
famous
by
the
raid
of
cooley
i
met
john
years
old
of
longfield
townland
leading
his
horse
to
pasture
and
i
stopped
to
talk
with
him
about
the
people
in
this
mountain
he
said
the
people
who
have
died
and
been
the
mountain
is
enchanted
overflowing
of
the
old
woman
came
to
the
wife
of
steven
callaghan
and
told
her
not
to
let
steven
cut
a
certain
hedge
it
is
where
we
shelter
at
night
the
old
woman
added
and
callaghan
recognized
the
old
woman
as
one
who
had
been
in
confinement
a
few
nights
later
the
same
old
woman
appeared
to
callaghan
and
asked
for
charity
and
she
was
offered
some
meal
which
she
did
not
take
then
she
asked
for
lodgings
but
did
not
stop
when
callaghan
saw
the
next
morning
it
was
overflowing
with
meal
it
was
the
old
woman
gift
for
the
hedge
the
testimony
of
two
dromintee
percipients
after
my
friend
the
rev
father
donnellan
of
dromintee
county
armagh
had
introduced
me
to
alice
cunningham
of
his
parish
and
she
had
told
much
about
the
folk
she
emphatically
declared
that
they
do
exist
and
this
in
the
presence
of
father
donnellan
because
she
has
often
seen
them
on
carrickbroad
mountain
near
where
she
lives
and
she
then
reported
as
follows
concerning
enchanted
slieve
gullion
guardian
of
slieve
top
of
slieve
gullion
is
a
very
place
a
fairy
has
her
house
there
by
the
lake
but
she
is
invisible
she
interferes
with
nobody
i
hear
of
no
places
about
here
than
carrickbroad
and
slieve
gullion
father
donnellan
and
i
called
next
upon
thomas
mccrink
and
his
wife
at
carrifamayan
because
mccrink
claims
to
have
seen
some
of
the
people
and
this
is
her
testimony
of
the
heard
and
felt
the
coming
on
the
wind
and
i
once
saw
them
down
in
the
middle
field
on
my
father
place
playing
football
they
are
still
on
earth
among
them
are
the
spirits
of
our
ancestors
and
these
rejoice
whenever
good
fortune
comes
our
way
for
i
saw
them
before
my
mother
won
her
land
after
a
long
legal
contest
in
the
field
rejoicing
of
the
i
have
thought
were
fallen
angels
though
these
may
be
dead
people
whose
time
is
not
up
we
are
only
like
shadows
in
this
world
my
mother
died
in
england
and
she
came
to
me
in
the
spirit
i
saw
her
plainly
i
ran
to
catch
her
but
my
hands
ran
through
her
form
as
if
it
were
mere
mist
then
there
was
a
crack
and
she
was
gone
and
finally
after
a
moment
our
percipient
said
fairies
once
passed
down
this
lane
here
on
a
christmas
morning
and
i
took
them
to
be
suffering
souls
out
of
purgatory
going
to
mass
the
testimony
of
a
dromintee
seeress
father
donnellan
the
following
day
took
me
to
talk
with
almost
the
oldest
woman
in
his
parish
biddy
grant
years
old
of
upper
toughal
beside
slieve
gullion
grant
is
a
fine
specimen
of
an
irishwoman
with
white
hair
clear
complexion
and
an
expression
of
great
natural
intelligence
though
now
somewhat
feeble
from
age
her
mind
is
yet
clear
however
and
her
testimony
is
substantiated
by
this
statement
from
her
own
daughter
who
lives
with
her
mother
has
the
power
of
seeing
things
it
is
a
fact
with
her
that
spirits
exist
she
has
seen
much
even
in
her
old
age
and
what
she
is
always
telling
me
scares
me
half
to
death
the
following
is
grant
direct
testimony
given
at
her
own
home
on
september
in
answer
to
our
question
if
she
knew
anything
about
the
people
the
people
as
the
saw
once
as
plain
as
can
be
big
little
old
and
young
i
was
in
bed
at
the
time
and
a
boy
whom
i
had
reared
since
he
was
born
was
lying
ill
beside
me
two
of
came
and
looked
at
him
then
came
in
three
of
one
of
seemed
to
have
something
like
a
book
and
he
put
his
hand
to
the
boy
mouth
then
he
went
away
while
others
appeared
opening
the
back
window
to
make
an
avenue
through
the
house
and
through
this
avenue
came
great
crowds
at
this
i
shook
the
boy
and
said
to
him
do
you
see
anything
no
he
said
but
as
i
made
him
look
a
second
time
he
said
i
do
after
that
he
got
well
were
the
spirits
of
our
dead
friends
but
i
could
not
recognize
them
i
have
often
seen
them
that
way
while
in
my
bed
many
women
are
among
them
i
once
touched
a
boy
of
theirs
and
he
was
just
like
feathers
in
my
hand
there
was
no
substance
in
him
and
i
knew
he
was
a
living
being
i
do
know
where
they
live
i
heard
they
live
in
the
rocks
many
a
time
i
heard
of
their
people
or
leading
them
astray
they
ca
live
far
away
when
they
come
to
me
in
such
a
rush
they
are
as
big
as
we
are
i
think
these
fairy
people
are
all
through
this
country
and
in
the
mountains
apparition
of
a
woman
a
wake
i
went
out
of
doors
at
midnight
and
saw
a
woman
running
up
and
down
the
field
with
a
strange
light
in
her
hand
i
called
out
my
daughter
but
she
saw
nothing
though
all
the
time
the
woman
dressed
in
white
was
in
the
field
shaking
the
light
and
running
back
and
forth
as
fast
as
you
could
wink
i
thought
the
woman
might
be
the
spirit
of
nancy
frink
but
i
was
not
sure
cf
pp
evidence
from
lough
gur
county
limerick
one
of
the
most
interesting
parts
of
ireland
for
the
archaeologist
and
for
the
alike
is
the
territory
immediately
surrounding
lough
gur
county
limerick
shut
in
for
the
most
part
from
the
outer
world
by
a
circle
of
hills
on
whose
summits
fairy
goddesses
yet
dwell
invisibly
this
region
famous
for
its
numerous
and
cromlechs
dolmens
menhirs
and
tumuli
and
for
the
rare
current
among
its
peasantry
has
long
been
popularly
regarded
as
a
sort
of
otherworld
preserve
haunted
by
fairy
beings
who
dwell
both
in
its
waters
and
on
its
land
there
seems
to
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
in
times
the
lough
gur
country
was
a
very
sacred
spot
a
mystic
centre
for
pilgrimages
and
for
the
celebration
of
celtic
religious
rites
including
those
of
initiation
the
lough
is
still
enchanted
but
once
in
seven
years
the
spell
passes
off
it
and
it
then
appears
like
dry
land
to
any
one
that
is
fortunate
enough
to
behold
it
at
such
a
time
of
disenchantment
a
tree
is
seen
growing
up
through
the
a
tree
like
the
strange
of
scandinavian
myth
the
tree
is
covered
with
a
green
cloth
and
under
it
sits
the
lake
guardian
a
woman
knitting
the
peasantry
about
lough
gur
still
believe
that
beneath
its
waters
there
is
one
of
the
chief
entrances
in
ireland
to
the
of
youth
the
fairy
realm
and
when
a
child
is
stolen
by
the
munster
fairies
gur
is
conjectured
to
be
the
place
of
its
unearthly
transmutation
from
the
human
to
the
fairy
state
to
my
friend
count
john
de
salis
of
balliol
college
i
am
indebted
for
the
following
legendary
material
collected
by
him
on
the
lough
gur
estate
his
ancestral
home
and
annotated
by
the
rev
lynch
one
of
the
antiquarians
living
in
that
part
of
south
ireland
fairy
goddesses
aine
and
fennel
or
finnen
are
two
hills
near
lough
gur
upon
whose
summits
sacrifices
and
sacred
rites
used
to
be
celebrated
according
to
living
tradition
one
about
three
miles
of
the
lake
is
called
knock
aine
aine
or
ane
being
the
name
of
an
ancient
irish
goddess
derived
from
bright
the
other
the
highest
hill
on
the
is
called
knock
fennel
or
hill
of
the
goddess
fennel
from
or
or
a
form
of
white
the
peasantry
of
the
region
call
aine
one
of
the
good
people
and
they
say
that
fennel
apparently
her
sister
goddess
or
a
variant
of
herself
lived
on
the
top
of
knock
fennel
termed
finnen
in
a
state
paper
dated
fairy
old
peasants
have
told
me
that
on
clear
calm
moonlight
nights
in
summer
fairy
boats
appear
racing
across
lough
gur
the
boats
come
from
the
eastern
side
of
the
lake
and
when
they
have
arrived
at
garrod
island
where
the
desmond
castle
lies
in
ruins
they
vanish
behind
knock
adoon
there
are
four
of
these
phantom
boats
and
in
each
there
are
two
men
rowing
and
a
woman
steering
no
sound
is
heard
though
the
seer
can
see
the
weird
silvery
splash
of
the
oars
and
the
churning
of
the
water
at
the
bows
of
the
boats
as
they
shoot
along
it
is
evident
that
they
are
racing
because
one
boat
gets
ahead
of
the
others
and
all
the
rowers
can
be
seen
straining
at
the
oars
boats
and
occupants
seem
to
be
transparent
and
you
can
not
see
exactly
what
their
nature
is
one
old
peasant
told
me
that
it
is
the
shining
brightness
of
the
clothes
on
the
phantom
rowers
and
on
the
women
who
steer
which
makes
them
visible
man
who
is
about
forty
years
of
age
and
as
far
as
i
know
of
good
habits
assures
me
that
he
also
has
seen
this
fairy
and
that
it
can
still
be
seen
at
the
proper
season
the
fairy
housekeeper
of
the
enchanted
submerged
castle
of
the
earl
of
desmond
is
supposed
to
appear
sitting
on
an
ancient
earthen
monument
shaped
like
a
great
chair
and
hence
called
the
housekeeper
little
seat
on
knock
adoon
hill
of
the
fort
which
juts
out
into
the
lough
the
as
i
have
heard
an
old
peasant
tell
the
tale
was
once
asleep
on
her
seat
when
the
or
little
herd
boy
stole
her
golden
comb
when
the
awoke
and
saw
what
had
happened
she
cast
a
curse
upon
the
cattle
of
the
and
soon
all
of
them
were
dead
and
then
the
little
herd
boy
himself
died
but
before
his
death
he
ordered
the
golden
comb
to
be
cast
into
the
lough
gur
fairies
in
peasantry
in
the
lough
gur
region
commonly
speak
of
the
or
of
the
or
of
the
their
names
for
the
fairies
the
leprechaun
indicates
the
place
where
hidden
treasure
is
to
be
found
if
the
person
to
whom
he
reveals
such
a
secret
makes
it
known
to
a
second
person
the
first
person
dies
or
else
no
money
is
found
in
some
cases
the
money
is
changed
into
ivy
leaves
or
into
furze
blossoms
am
convinced
that
some
of
the
older
peasants
still
believe
in
fairies
i
used
to
go
out
on
the
lake
occasionally
on
moonlight
nights
and
an
old
woman
supposed
to
be
a
wise
woman
a
seeress
hearing
about
my
doing
this
told
me
that
under
no
circumstances
should
i
continue
the
practice
for
fear
of
them
people
the
fairies
one
evening
in
particular
i
was
warned
by
her
not
to
venture
on
the
lake
she
solemnly
asserted
that
the
powers
of
darkness
were
then
abroad
and
that
it
would
be
misfortune
for
me
to
be
in
their
path
ordinary
circumstances
as
a
very
close
observer
of
the
lough
gur
peasantry
informs
me
the
old
people
will
pray
to
the
saints
but
if
by
any
chance
such
prayers
remain
unanswered
they
then
invoke
other
powers
the
fairies
the
goddesses
aine
and
fennel
or
other
pagan
deities
whom
they
seem
to
remember
in
a
vague
subconscious
manner
through
tradition
testimony
from
a
county
kerry
seer
to
another
of
my
fellow
students
in
oxford
a
native
irishman
of
county
kerry
i
am
indebted
for
the
following
evidence
collective
vision
of
spiritual
few
weeks
before
christmas
at
midnight
on
a
very
dark
night
i
and
another
young
man
who
like
myself
was
then
about
years
of
age
were
on
horseback
on
our
way
home
from
limerick
when
near
listowel
we
noticed
a
light
about
half
a
mile
ahead
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
a
light
in
some
house
but
as
we
came
nearer
to
it
and
it
was
passing
out
of
our
direct
line
of
vision
we
saw
that
it
was
moving
up
and
down
to
and
fro
diminishing
to
a
spark
then
expanding
into
a
yellow
luminous
flame
before
we
came
to
listowel
we
noticed
two
lights
about
one
hundred
yards
to
our
right
resembling
the
light
seen
first
suddenly
each
of
these
lights
expanded
into
the
same
sort
of
yellow
luminous
flame
about
six
feet
high
by
four
feet
broad
in
the
midst
of
each
flame
we
saw
a
radiant
being
having
human
form
presently
the
lights
moved
toward
one
another
and
made
contact
whereupon
the
two
beings
in
them
were
seen
to
be
walking
side
by
side
the
beings
bodies
were
formed
of
a
pure
dazzling
radiance
white
like
the
radiance
of
the
sun
and
much
brighter
than
the
yellow
light
or
aura
surrounding
them
so
dazzling
was
the
radiance
like
a
halo
round
their
heads
that
we
could
not
distinguish
the
countenances
of
the
beings
we
could
only
distinguish
the
general
shape
of
their
bodies
though
their
heads
were
very
clearly
outlined
because
this
radiance
which
was
the
brightest
light
about
them
seemed
to
radiate
from
or
rest
upon
the
head
of
each
being
as
we
travelled
on
a
house
intervened
between
us
and
the
lights
and
we
saw
no
more
of
them
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
ever
seen
such
phenomena
and
in
our
hurry
to
get
home
we
were
not
wise
enough
to
stop
and
make
further
examination
but
ever
since
that
night
i
have
frequently
seen
both
in
ireland
and
in
england
similar
lights
with
spiritual
beings
in
them
cf
pp
of
the
spiritual
my
companion
who
saw
all
that
i
saw
of
the
first
three
lights
i
formerly
had
always
been
a
sceptic
as
to
the
existence
of
spirits
now
i
know
that
there
is
a
spiritual
world
my
brother
a
physician
had
been
equally
sceptical
until
he
saw
near
our
home
at
listowel
similar
lights
containing
spiritual
beings
and
was
obliged
to
admit
the
genuineness
of
the
phenomena
whatever
country
we
may
be
i
believe
that
we
are
for
ever
immersed
in
the
spiritual
world
but
most
of
us
can
not
perceive
it
on
account
of
the
unrefined
nature
of
our
physical
bodies
through
meditation
and
psychical
training
one
can
come
to
see
the
spiritual
world
and
its
beings
we
pass
into
the
spirit
realm
at
death
and
come
back
into
the
human
world
at
birth
and
we
continue
to
reincarnate
until
we
have
overcome
all
earthly
desires
and
mortal
appetites
then
the
higher
life
is
open
to
our
consciousness
and
we
cease
to
be
human
we
become
divine
beings

it

declare
that

the

out

done

family
had
been
familiar
with
the
fairies
in
their
secret
flights
and
nightly
migrations
donald
macalastair
years
of
age
crofter
arran
told
me
in
the
year
the
following
story
in
gaelic
fairies
were
dwelling
in
the
knoll
and
they
had
a
near
neighbour
who
used
to
visit
them
in
their
home
the
man
used
to
observe
the
ways
of
the
fairies
and
to
do
as
they
did
the
fairies
took
a
journey
upon
them
to
go
to
ireland
and
the
man
took
upon
him
to
go
with
them
every
single
fairy
of
them
caught
a
ragwort
and
went
astride
it
and
they
were
every
knee
of
them
across
the
irish
ocean
in
an
instant
and
across
the
irish
ocean
was
the
man
after
them
astride
a
ragwort
like
one
of
themselves
a
little
wee
tiny
fairy
shouted
and
asked
were
they
all
ready
and
all
the
others
replied
that
they
were
and
the
little
fairy
called
out
my
king
at
my
head
going
across
in
my
haste
on
the
crests
of
the
waves
to
ireland
follow
me
said
the
king
of
the
fairies
and
away
they
went
across
the
irish
ocean
every
mother
son
of
them
astride
his
ragwort
macuga
cook
did
not
know
on
earth
how
he
would
return
to
his
native
land
but
he
leapt
upon
the
ragwort
as
he
saw
the
fairies
do
and
he
called
as
he
heard
them
call
and
in
an
instant
he
was
back
in
arran
but
he
had
got
enough
of
the
fairies
on
this
trip
itself
and
he
never
went
with
them
again
the
fairies
were
wont
to
take
away
infants
and
their
mothers
and
many
precautions
were
taken
to
safeguard
them
till
purification
and
baptism
took
place
when
the
fairy
power
became
ineffective
placing
iron
about
the
bed
burning
leather
in
the
room
giving
mother
and
child
the
milk
of
a
cow
which
had
eaten
of
the
a
plant
of
virtue
and
similar
means
were
taken
to
ensure
their
safety
if
the
neglected
these
precautions
the
mother
or
child
or
both
were
spirited
away
to
the
fairy
bower
many
stories
are
current
on
this
subject
sometimes
the
fairies
helped
human
beings
with
their
work
coming
in
at
night
to
finish
the
spinning
or
the
or
to
thresh
the
farmer
corn
or
fan
his
grain
on
such
occasions
they
must
not
be
molested
nor
interfered
with
even
in
gratitude
if
presented
with
a
garment
they
will
go
away
and
work
no
more
this
method
of
getting
rid
of
them
is
often
resorted
to
as
it
is
not
easy
always
to
find
work
for
them

do

and
the

of
the
spiders
into
a

from
the
stalk
of
the
fairy
reed
she
can
bring
the
music
of
the
lull
of
the
peace
and
of
the
repose
however
active
the
brain
and
lithe
the
limb
and
she
can
rouse
to
mirth
and
merriment
and
to
the
dance
men
and
women
however
dolorous
their
condition
from
the
bower
could
be
heard
the
pipe
and
the
song
and
the
voice
of
laughter
as
the
fairies
and
reeled
in
the
mazes
of
the
dance
sometimes
a
man
hearing
the
merry
music
and
seeing
the
wonderful
light
within
would
be
tempted
to
go
in
and
join
them
but
woe
to
him
if
he
omitted
to
leave
a
piece
of
iron
at
the
door
of
the
bower
on
entering
for
the
cunning
fairies
would
close
the
door
and
the
man
would
find
no
egress
there
he
would
dance
for
years
but
to
him
the
years
were
as
one
day
while
his
wife
and
family
mourned
him
as
dead

much
prized

fairy
arrows
they
are
said
to
have
been
thrown
by
the
fairies
at
the
sons
and
daughters
of
men
the
writer
possesses
one
which
was
thrown
at
his
own
one
night
when
she
went
to
the
peatstack
for
peats
she
was
aware
of
something
whizzing
through
the
silent
air
passing
through
her
hair
grazing
her
ear
and
falling
at
her
feet
stooping
in
the
bright
moonlight
the
girl
picked
up
a
fairy
arrow
faith
is
dead
such
things
do
not
happen
now
said
a
courteous
informant
if
not
quite
dead
it
is
almost
dead
hastened
by
the
shifting
of
population
the
establishment
of
means
of
communication
the
influx
of
tourists
and
the
scorn

materialistic
of

of

people

edinburgh
aberfoyle
the
country
of
robert
kirk
my
first
hunt
for
fairies
in
scotland
began
at
aberfoyle
where
the
highlands
and
the
lowlands
meet
and
in
the
very
place
where
robert
kirk
the
minister
of
aberfoyle
was
by
them
in
the
year
the
minister
spent
a
large
part
of
his
time
studying
the
ways
of
the
people
and
he
must
have
been
able
to
see
them
for
he
was
a
seventh
son
macgregor
who
keeps
the
key
to
the
old
churchyard
where
there
is
a
tomb
to
kirk
though
many
say
there
is
nothing
in
it
but
a
coffin
filled
with
stones
told
me
that
kirk
was
taken
into
the
fairy
knoll
which
she
pointed
to
just
across
a
little
valley
in
front
of
us
and
is
there
yet
for
the
hill
is
full
of
caverns
and
in
them
the
people
have
their
homes
and
she
added
that
kirk
appeared
to
a
relative
of
his
after
he
was
and
said
that
he
was
in
the
power
of
the
people
and
could
get
away
says
he
can
be
set
free
if
you
will
have
my
cousin
do
what
i
tell
him
when
i
appear
again
at
the
christening
of
my
child
in
the
parsonage
according
to
andrew
lang
who
reports
the
same
tradition
in
more
detail
in
his
admirable
introduction
to
secret
the
cousin
was
grahame
of
duchray
and
the
thing
he
was
to
do
was
to
throw
a
dagger
over
kirk
head
grahame
was
at
hand
at
the
christening
of
the
posthumous
child
but
was
so
astonished
to
see
kirk
appear
as
kirk
said
he
would
that
he
did
not
throw
the
dagger
and
so
kirk
became
a
perpetual
prisoner
of
the
people
after
having
visited
kirk
tomb
i
called
on
the
rev
william
taylor
the
present
successor
of
kirk
and
as
we
sat
together
in
the
very
room
where
kirk
must
have
written
his
he
told
me
that
tradition
reports
kirk
as
having
been
by
the
fairies
while
he
was
walking
on
their
hill
which
is
but
a
short
way
from
the
parsonage
the
time
of
his
disappearance
people
said
he
was
because
the
fairies
were
displeased
with
him
for
prying
into
their
secrets
at
all
events
it
seems
likely
that
kirk
was
taken
ill
very
suddenly
with
something
like
apoplexy
while
on
the
fairy
knoll
and
died
there
i
have
searched
the
presbytery
books
and
find
no
record
of
how
kirk
death
really
took
place
but
of
course
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
of
his
body
being
in
the
grave
so
thus
according
to
taylor
we
are
to
conclude
that
if
the
fairies
carried
off
anything
it
must
have
been
the
spirit
or
soul
of
kirk
i
talked
with
others
round
aberfoyle
about
kirk
and
some
would
have
it
that
his
body
and
soul
were
both
and
that
what
was
buried
was
no
corpse
at
all
margaret
macgregor
one
of
the
few
gaelic
speakers
of
the
old
school
left
in
aberfoyle
holds
another
opinion
for
she
said
to
me
could
be
surer
than
that
the
took
kirk
spirit
only
in
the
aberfoyle
country
the
save
for
the
stories
about
kirk
which
will
probably
persist
for
a
long
time
yet
is
rapidly
passing
in
fact
it
is
almost
forgotten
now
up
to
thirty
years
ago
as
taylor
explained
before
the
railway
reached
aberfoyle
belief
in
fairies
was
much
more
common
nowadays
he
says
there
is
no
real
among
the
peasants
fifty
to
sixty
years
ago
there
was
and
in
his
opinion
fairy
people
of
three
hundred
years
ago
in
scotland
were
a
distinct
race
by
themselves
they
had
never
been
human
beings
the
belief
in
them
was
a
survival
of
paganism
and
not
at
all
an
outgrowth
of
christian
belief
in
angelic
hosts
a
scotch
minister
testimony
a
protestant
minister
of
scotland
will
be
our
next
witness
he
is
a
native
of
though
he
draws
many
of
his
stories
from
the
western
hebrides
where
his
calling
has
placed
him
because
he
speaks
from
personal
knowledge
of
the
living
as
it
was
in
his
boyhood
and
is
now
and
chiefly
because
he
has
had
the
rare
privilege
of
conscious
contact
with
the
fairy
world
his
testimony
is
of
the
highest
value
of
i
was
a
boy
i
was
a
firm
believer
in
fairies
and
now
as
a
christian
minister
i
believe
in
the
possibility
and
also
the
reality
of
these
spiritual
orders
but
i
wish
only
to
know
those
orders
which
belong
to
the
realm
of
grace
it
is
very
certain
that
they
exist
i
have
been
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
and
have
seen
spiritual
beings
which
form
these
orders
believe
in
the
actuality
of
evil
spirits
but
people
in
the
highlands
having
put
aside
paganism
evil
spirits
are
not
seen
now
this
explanation
was
offered
of
how
fairies
may
exist
and
yet
be
invisible
saviour
became
invisible
though
in
the
body
and
as
the
scriptures
suggest
i
suppose
we
are
obliged
to
concede
a
similar
power
of
invisibility
to
spirits
as
well
good
and
evil
ones
alike
against
remember
how
an
old
woman
pulled
me
out
of
a
fairy
ring
to
save
me
from
being
a
mother
takes
some
bindweed
and
places
it
burnt
at
the
ends
over
her
babe
cradle
the
fairies
have
no
power
over
the
child
the
bindweed
is
a
common
roadside
convolvulus
a
boy
i
saw
two
old
women
passing
a
babe
over
coals
and
then
drop
some
of
the
cinders
in
a
cup
of
water
and
give
the
water
to
the
babe
to
drink
in
order
to
cure
it
of
a
fairy
stroke
fights
on
is
a
common
belief
now
that
on
halloween
the
fairies
or
the
fairy
hosts
have
fights
lichens
on
rocks
after
there
has
been
a
frost
get
and
then
when
they
thaw
and
the
moisture
spreads
out
from
them
the
rocks
are
a
bright
red
and
this
bright
red
is
said
to
be
the
blood
of
the
fairies
after
one
of
their
battles
and
the
the
following
story
by
the
present
witness
is
curious
for
it
is
the
same
story
of
a
which
is
so
widespread
the
fact
that
in
scotland
the
hump
is
removed
or
added
by
fairies
as
it
is
in
ireland
in
cornwall
by
pixies
and
in
brittany
by
goes
far
to
prove
the
essential
identity
of
these
three
orders
of
beings
the
story
comes
from
one
of
the
remote
western
hebrides
benbecula
man
who
was
a
once
met
the
fairies
dancing
and
danced
with
their
queen
and
he
sang
with
them
monday
tuesday
wednesday
so
well
that
they
took
off
his
hump
and
he
returned
home
a
man
then
a
tailor
went
past
the
same
place
and
was
also
admitted
by
the
fairies
to
their
dance
he
caught
the
fairy
queen
by
the
waist
and
she
resented
his
familiarity
and
in
singing
he
added
thursday
to
their
song
and
spoilt
it
to
pay
the
tailor
for
his
rudeness
and
ill
manners
the
dancers
took
up
the
hump
they
had
just
removed
from
the
first
man
and
clapped
it
on
his
back
and
the
conceited
fellow
went
home
a
to
elder
in
my
church
knew
a
woman
who
was
accustomed
in
milking
her
cows
to
offer
libations
to
the
fairies
the
woman
was
later
converted
to
christ
and
gave
up
the
practice
and
as
a
result
one
of
her
cows
was
by
the
fairies
then
she
revived
the
practice
fairy
queen
who
watches
over
cows
is
called
in
the
islands
and
she
is
often
seen
in
pouring
libations
to
her
and
her
fairies
various
kinds
of
stones
usually
with
hollows
in
them
are
used
lewis
libations
are
poured
to
the
goddess
or
god
of
the
sea
called
in
order
to
bring
in
seaweed
until
modern
times
in
iona
similar
libations
were
poured
to
a
god
corresponding
to
neptune
in
the
highlands
i
had
the
pleasure
as
well
as
the
great
privilege
of
setting
out
from
inverness
on
a
bright
crisp
september
morning
in
company
with
alexander
carmichael
the
of
scotland
to
study
the
as
it
exists
now
in
the
highlands
round
tomatin
a
small
country
village
about
twenty
miles
distant
we
departed
by
an
early
train
and
soon
reaching
the
tomatin
country
began
our
search
carmichael
for
evidence
regarding
rare
and
curious
scotch
beliefs
connected
with
such
as
at
a
distance
and
removing
motes
in
the
eye
at
a
distance
and
i
for
highland
ghosts
and
fairies
our
first
experience
was
with
an
old
man
whom
we
met
on
the
road
between
the
railway
station
and
the
post
office
who
could
speak
only
gaelic
carmichael
talked
with
him
awhile
and
then
asked
him
about
fairies
and
he
said
there
were
some
living
in
a
cave
some
way
off
but
as
the
distance
was
rather
too
far
we
decided
not
to
call
on
them
then
we
went
on
to
see
the
postmaster
john
macdougall
and
he
told
us
that
in
his
boyhood
the
round
tomatin
believed
thoroughly
in
fairies
he
said
they
thought
of
them
as
a
race
of
spirits
capable
of
making
themselves
visible
to
mortals
as
living
in
underground
places
as
fine
healthy
babes
and
leaving
changelings
in
their
place
these
changelings
would
waste
away
and
die
in
a
short
time
after
being
left
so
firmly
did
the
old
people
believe
in
fairies
then
that
they
would
ridicule
a
person
for
not
believing
and
now
quite
the
reverse
state
has
come
about
the
testimony
of
john
dunbar
of
invereen
we
talked
with
other
highlanders
in
the
country
round
tomatin
and
heard
only
echoes
mostly
fragmentary
of
what
their
forefathers
used
to
believe
about
fairies
but
at
invereen
we
discovered
john
dunbar
a
highlander
who
really
knows
the
and
is
not
ashamed
to
explain
it
speaking
partly
from
experience
and
partly
from
what
he
has
heard
his
parents
relate
concerning
the
people
he
said
sheep
and
the
believe
people
saw
fairies
but
i
think
one
reason
no
one
sees
them
now
is
because
every
place
in
this
parish
where
they
used
to
appear
has
been
put
into
sheep
and
deer
and
grouse
and
shooting
according
to
tradition
coig
na
fearn
is
the
place
where
the
last
fairy
was
seen
in
this
country
before
the
big
sheep
came
the
fairies
are
supposed
to
have
had
a
premonition
that
their
domains
were
to
be
violated
by
them
a
story
is
told
of
a
fight
between
the
sheep
and
fairies
or
else
of
the
fairies
hunting
the
sheep
james
macqueen
who
could
traffic
with
the
fairies
whom
he
regarded
as
ghosts
or
spirits
one
night
on
his
old
place
which
now
is
in
sheep
was
lying
down
all
alone
and
heard
a
small
and
big
barking
of
dogs
and
a
small
and
big
bleating
of
sheep
though
no
sheep
were
there
then
it
was
the
he
heard
i
put
an
axe
under
my
head
and
i
had
no
fear
therefore
he
always
repeated
when
telling
the
story
i
believe
the
man
saw
and
heard
something
and
macqueen
used
to
aid
the
fairies
and
on
that
account
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
he
always
found
more
meal
in
his
chest
than
he
thought
he
had
grandmother
believed
firmly
in
fairies
and
i
have
heard
her
tell
a
good
many
stories
about
them
they
were
a
small
people
dressed
in
green
and
had
dwellings
underground
in
dry
spots
fairies
were
often
heard
in
the
hills
over
there
pointing
and
i
believe
something
was
there
they
were
awful
for
music
and
used
to
be
heard
very
often
playing
the
bagpipes
a
woman
would
go
out
in
the
dark
after
giving
birth
to
a
child
before
the
child
was
christened
so
as
not
to
give
the
fairies
power
over
her
or
the
child
and
i
have
heard
people
say
that
if
fairies
were
refused
milk
and
meat
they
would
a
horse
or
a
cow
and
that
if
well
treated
they
would
repay
all
gifts
in
would
be
twenty
years
in
fairyland
and
it
would
seem
more
than
a
night
a
bridegroom
who
was
on
his
was
in
fairyland
for
many
generations
and
coming
back
thought
it
was
next
morning
he
asked
where
all
the
were
and
found
only
one
old
woman
who
remembered
the
wedding
legend
of
the
as
i
have
found
to
be
the
case
in
all
celtic
countries
equally
fairy
stories
nearly
always
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
psychology
known
as
association
of
ideas
give
place
to
or
are
blended
with
legends
of
the
dead
this
is
an
important
factor
for
the
psychological
theory
and
what
follows
proves
the
same
ideas
to
be
present
to
the
mind
of
dunbar
people
after
death
are
seen
in
their
old
haunts
no
mistake
about
it
a
bailiff
had
false
corn
and
meal
measures
and
so
after
he
died
he
came
back
to
his
daughter
and
told
her
he
could
have
no
peace
until
the
measures
were
burned
she
complied
with
her
father
wish
and
his
spirit
was
never
seen
again
i
have
known
also
of
phantom
funerals
of
people
who
died
soon
afterwards
being
seen
on
the
road
at
night
to
the
western
hebrides
from
inverness
i
began
my
journey
to
the
western
hebrides
while
i
waited
for
the
steamer
to
take
me
from
kyle
to
the
isle
of
skye
an
old
man
with
whom
i
talked
on
the
docks
said
this
about
neill
mackintosh
of
black
island
ca
argue
with
the
old
man
that
he
has
seen
fairies
he
can
tell
you
all
about
them
evidence
from
the
isle
of
skye
miss
frances
tolmie
who
was
born
at
uignish
isle
of
skye
and
has
lived
many
years
in
the
isle
in
close
touch
with
some
of
its
oldest
folk
contributes
from
edinburgh
the
evidence
which
follows
the
first
two
tales
were
told
in
the
parish
of
minginish
a
number
of
years
ago
by
mary
macdonald
a
and
have
their
setting
in
the
region
of
the
koolian
range
of
mountains
on
the
west
side
of
skye
fatal
peat
aged
nurse
who
had
fallen
fast
asleep
as
she
sat
by
the
fire
was
holding
on
her
knees
a
babe
the
mother
who
lay
in
bed
gazing
dreamily
was
astonished
to
see
three
strange
little
women
enter
the
dwelling
they
approached
the
unconscious
child
and
she
who
seemed
to
be
their
leader
was
on
the
point
of
lifting
it
off
the
nurse
lap
when
the
third
exclaimed
oh
let
us
leave
this
one
with
her
as
we
have
already
taken
so
many
so
be
it
replied
the
senior
of
the
party
in
a
tone
of
displeasure
but
when
that
peat
now
burning
on
the
hearth
shall
be
consumed
her
life
will
surely
come
to
an
end
then
the
three
little
figures
passed
out
the
good
wife
recognizing
them
to
be
fairies
sprang
from
her
bed
and
poured
over
the
fire
all
the
water
she
could
find
and
extinguished
the
ember
this
she
wrapped
carefully
in
a
piece
of
cloth
and
deposited
at
the
very
bottom
of
a
large
chest
which
afterwards
she
always
kept
locked
passed
and
the
babe
grew
into
a
beautiful
young
woman
in
the
course
of
time
she
was
betrothed
and
according
to
custom
not
appearing
in
public
at
church
on
the
sunday
preceding
the
day
appointed
for
her
marriage
remained
at
home
alone
to
amuse
herself
she
began
to
search
the
contents
of
all
the
in
the
house
and
came
at
last
to
the
chest
containing
the
peat
ember
in
her
haste
the
good
mother
had
that
day
forgotten
the
key
of
the
chest
which
was
now
in
the
lock
at
the
bottom
of
the
chest
the
girl
found
a
curious
packet
containing
nothing
but
a
morsel
of
peat
and
this
apparently
useless
thing
she
tossed
away
into
the
fire
when
the
peat
was
well
kindled
the
young
girl
began
to
feel
very
ill
and
when
her
mother
returned
was
dying
the
open
chest
and
the
blazing
peat
explained
the
cause
of
the
calamity
the
fairy
prediction
was
fulfilled
of
refusing
fairy
women
were
walking
toward
the
point
when
one
of
them
hearing
churning
going
on
under
a
hillock
expressed
aloud
a
wish
for
some
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
than
a
very
small
figure
of
a
woman
came
out
with
a
bowlful
and
offered
it
to
her
but
the
thirsty
woman
ignorant
of
fairy
customs
and
the
penalty
attending
their
infringement
declined
the
kind
offer
of
refreshment
and
immediately
found
herself
a
prisoner
in
the
hillock
she
was
led
to
an
apartment
containing
a
chest
full
of
meal
and
a
great
bag
of
wool
and
was
told
by
the
fairy
that
when
she
had
eaten
all
the
meal
and
spun
all
the
wool
she
would
be
free
to
return
to
her
home
the
prisoner
at
once
set
herself
to
eating
and
spinning
assiduously
but
without
apparent
result
and
despairing
of
completing
the
task
consulted
an
old
man
of
very
sad
countenance
who
had
long
been
a
captive
in
the
hillock
he
willingly
gave
her
his
advice
which
was
to
wet
her
left
eye
with
saliva
each
morning
before
she
settled
down
to
her
task
she
followed
this
advice
and
gradually
the
wool
and
the
meal
were
exhausted
then
the
fairy
granted
her
freedom
but
in
doing
so
cursed
the
old
man
and
said
that
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
keep
him
in
the
hillock
for
ever
fairies
fulling
ebost
in
bracadale
an
old
woman
was
living
in
a
little
hut
with
no
companion
save
a
wise
cat
as
we
talked
she
expressed
her
wonder
that
no
fairies
are
ever
seen
or
heard
nowadays
she
could
remember
hearing
her
father
tell
how
he
when
a
had
heard
the
fairies
singing
a
waulking
song
in
an
ancient
and
ruined
round
tower
in
the
parish
of
dùirinish
and
not

from

occasionally
alluded
to
as
macleod

the
youth
was
lying
on
the
summit
of
the
ruin
and
heard
them
distinctly
as
if
with
exultation
one
voice
took
the
verse
and
then
the
whole
company
joined
in
the
following
chorus

tale
was
related
by
neil
macleod
the
bard
of
skye
colin
was
a
gentleman
of
clan
campbell
in
perthshire
who
was
married
to
a
beautiful
maiden
whom
the
fairies
carried
off
on
her
and
on
whom
they
cast
a
spell
which
rendered
her
invisible
for
a
day
and
a
year
she
came
regularly
every
day
to
milk
the
cows
of
her
sorrowing
husband
and
sang
sweetly
to
them
while
she
milked
but
he
never
once
had
the
pleasure
of
beholding
her
though
he
could
hear
perfectly
what
she
sang
at
the
expiry
of
the
year
she
was
to
his
great
joy
restored
to
him
legend
of
the
macleod
is
a
legend
told
of
the
macleod
family
soon
after
the
heir
of
the
macleods
was
born
a
beautiful
woman
in
wonderful
raiment
who
was
a
fairy
woman
or
banshee
there
were
joyous
as
well
as
mourning
banshees
appeared
at
the
castle
and
went
directly
to
the
babe
cradle
she
took
up
the
babe
and
chanted
over
it
a
series
of
verses
and
each
verse
had
its
own
melody
the
verses
foretold
the
future
manhood
of
the
young
child
and
acted
as
a
protective
charm
over
its
life
then
she
put
the
babe
back
into
its
cradle
and
going
out
disappeared
across
the
moorlands
many
generations
it
was
a
custom
in
the
macleod
family
that
whoever
was
the
nurse
of
the
heir
must
sing
those
verses
as
the
fairy
woman
had
sung
them
after
a
time
the
song
was
forgotten
but
at
a
later
period
it
was
partially
recovered
and
it
is
one
of
the
proud
heritages
of
the
macleod
family
and
nature
of
the

respect
to
the
origin
and
nature
of
the
scotch
miss
tolmie
states
a
child
i
was
not
permitted
to
hear
about
fairies
at
twenty
i
was
seeking
and
trying
to
understand
the
beliefs
of
my
fathers
in
the
light
of
modern
ideas
i
was
very
determined
not
to
lose
the
past
originated
in
a
cultured
class
in
very
ancient
times
the
peasants
inherited
it
they
did
not
invent
it
with
the
loss
of
gaelic
in
our
times
came
the
loss
of
the
classical
and
english
influences
combined
had
a
killing
effect
so
that
the
instinctive
religious
feeling
which
used
to
be
among
our
people
when
they
kept
alive
the
is
dead
we
have
creeds
and
doctrines
which
take
its
place
always
thought
of
fairies
as
mysterious
little
beings
living
in
hills
they
were
capricious
and
irritable
but
not
wicked
they
could
do
a
good
turn
as
well
as
a
bad
one
they
were
not
aerial
but
had
bodies
which
they
could
make
invisible
and
they
could
make
human
bodies
invisible
in
the
same
way
besides
their
hollow
knolls
and
mounds
there
seemed
to
be
a
subterranean
world
in
which
they
also
lived
where
things
are
like
what
they
are
in
this
world
the
isle
of
barra
western
hebrides
we
pass
from
cuchulainn
beautiful
island
to
what
is
now
the
most
celtic
part
of
scotland
the
western
hebrides
where
the
ancient
life
is
lived
yet
and
where
the
people
have
more
than
a
faith
in
spirits
and
fairies
and
no
one
of
the
western
hebrides
perhaps
excepting
the
tiny
island
of
erisgey
has
changed
less
during
the
last
five
hundred
years
than
barra
our
barra
guide
and
interpreter
michael
buchanan
a
native
and
a
resident
of
barra
is
seventy
years
old
yet
as
strong
and
active
as
a
city
man
at
fifty
he
knows
intimately
every
old
man
on
the
island
and
as
he
was
able
to
draw
them
out
on
the
subject
of
the
people
as
no
stranger
could
do
i
was
quite
willing
as
well
as
obliged
on
account
of
the
scotch
gaelic
to
let
him
act
on
my
behalf
in
all
my
collecting
on
barra
buchanan
is
the
author
of
a
little
book
called
macneils
of
barra
published
in
the
year
he
was
the
official
interpreter
before
the
commission
of
inquiry
which
was
appointed
by
the
british
parliament
in
to
search
into
the
oppression
of
landlordism
in
the
highlands
and
islands
and
he
acted
in
the
same
capacity
before
the
crofters
commission
and
the
commission
we
therefore
feel
perfectly
safe
in
allowing
him
to
present
before
our
jury
trying
the
the
evidence
of
the
witnesses
from
barra
john
macneil
testimony
we
met
the
first
of
the
barra
witnesses
on
the
top
of
a
rocky
hill
where
the
road
from
castlebay
passes
he
was
carrying
on
his
back
a
sack
of
sand
heavy
enough
for
a
college
athlete
and
he
an
old
man
between
seventy
and
eighty
years
of
age
michael
buchanan
has
known
john
macneil
all
his
life
for
they
were
boys
together
on
the
island
and
there
is
not
much
difference
between
them
in
age
our
interpreter
being
the
younger
then
the
three
of
us
sat
down
on
a
grassy
knoll
all
the
world
like
a
fairy
knoll
though
it
was
not
and
when
pipes
were
lit
and
the
weather
had
been
discussed
there
was
introduced
the
subject
of
the
people
all
in
gaelic
for
our
witness
now
about
to
testify
knows
no
english
and
what
john
macneil
said
is
thus
interpreted
by
michael
buchanan
fairy
i
have
in
answer
to
a
question
if
he
had
heard
of
people
being
by
the
people
or
fairies
fairy
woman
visited
the
house
of
a
young
wife
here
in
barra
and
the
young
wife
had
her
baby
on
her
breast
at
the
time
the
first
words
uttered
by
the
fairy
woman
were
heavy
is
your
child
and
the
wife
answered
light
is
everybody
who
lives
the
longest
were
it
not
that
you
have
answered
my
question
said
the
fairy
woman
and
understood
my
meaning
you
should
have
been
less
your
child
and
then
the
fairy
woman
departed
mother
and
two
other
women
well
known
here
in
barra
went
to
a
hill
one
day
to
look
after
their
sheep
and
a
thick
fog
coming
on
they
had
to
rest
awhile
they
then
sat
down
upon
a
knoll
and
began
to
sing
a
song
as
follows
it
is
early
that
i
have
risen
and
as
they
sang
a
fairy
woman
in
the
rocks
responded
to
their
song
with
one
of
her
own
of
then
the
question
was
asked
if
fairies
were
men
or
spirits
and
this
is
the
reply
never
saw
any
myself
and
so
can
not
tell
but
they
must
be
spirits
from
all
that
the
old
people
tell
about
them
or
else
how
could
they
appear
and
disappear
so
suddenly
the
old
people
said
they
did
know
if
fairies
were
flesh
and
blood
or
spirits
they
saw
them
as
men
of
more
diminutive
stature
than
our
race
i
heard
my
father
say
that
fairies
used
to
come
and
speak
to
natural
people
and
then
vanish
while
one
was
looking
at
them
fairy
women
used
to
go
into
houses
and
talk
and
then
vanish
the
general
belief
was
that
the
fairies
were
spirits
who
could
make
themselves
seen
or
not
seen
at
will
and
when
they
people
they
body
and
soul
together
the
testimony
of
john
campbell
years
old
our
next
witness
from
barra
is
john
campbell
who
is
years
old
yet
he
was
born
on
barra
at
sgalary
and
lives
near
there
now
at
breuvaig
we
were
on
our
way
to
call
at
his
home
when
we
met
him
coming
on
the
road
with
a
cane
in
each
hand
and
a
small
sack
hanging
from
one
of
them
michael
saluted
him
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
then
we
all
sat
down
on
a
big
boulder
in
the
warm
sunshine
beside
the
road
to
talk
the
first
thing
john
wanted
was
tobacco
and
when
this
was
supplied
we
gradually
led
from
one
subject
to
another
until
he
was
talking
about
fairies
and
this
is
what
he
said
about
them
fairy
and
the
had
a
companion
by
the
name
of
james
galbraith
who
was
drowned
about
forty
years
ago
and
one
time
he
was
crossing
from
the
west
side
of
the
island
to
the
east
side
to
the
township
called
sgalary
and
feeling
thirsty
took
a
drink
out
of
a
spring
well
on
the
after
he
had
taken
a
drink
he
looked
about
him
and
saw
a
woman
clad
in
green
and
imagined
that
no
woman
would
be
clad
in
such
a
colour
except
a
fairy
woman
he
went
on
his
way
and
when
he
had
gone
far
looked
back
and
as
he
looked
saw
the
woman
vanish
out
of
his
sight
he
afterwards
reported
the
incident
at
his
father
house
in
sgalary
and
his
father
said
he
also
had
seen
a
woman
clad
in
clothes
of
green
at
the
same
place
some
nights
before
pitied
by
the
heard
my
father
say
that
a
neighbour
of
his
father
that
is
of
my
grandfather
was
married
twice
and
had
three
children
from
the
first
marriage
and
when
married
for
the
second
time
a
son
and
daughter
his
second
wife
did
not
seem
to
be
kind
enough
to
the
children
of
the
first
wife
neglecting
their
food
and
clothing
and
keeping
them
constantly
at
hard
work
in
the
fields
and
at
herding
morning
when
the
man
and
his
second
wife
were
returning
from
mass
they
passed
the
pasture
where
their
cows
were
grazing
and
heard
the
enjoyable
of
the
bagpipes
the
father
said
what
may
this
be
and
going
off
the
road
found
the
eldest
son
of
the
first
wife
playing
the
bagpipes
to
his
heart
pleasure
and
asked
him
earnestly
how
did
you
come
to
play
the
bagpipes
so
suddenly
or
where
did
you
get
this
splendid
pair
of
bagpipes
the
boy
replied
an
old
man
came
to
me
while
i
was
in
the
action
of
roasting
pots
in
a
and
said
is
bad
to
you
and
in
towards
you
i
told
the
old
man
i
was
sensible
that
that
was
the
case
and
then
he
said
to
me
i
give
you
a
trade
will
you
be
inclined
to
follow
it
i
said
yes
and
the
old
man
then
continued
would
you
like
to
be
a
piper
by
trade
would
gladly
become
a
piper
says
i
what
am
i
to
do
without
the
bagpipes
and
the
tunes
to
play
supply
the
bagpipes
he
said
as
long
as
you
have
them
you
never
want
for
the
most
delightful
tunes
the
male
descendants
of
the
boy
in
question
were
all
famous
pipers
thereafter
and
the
last
of
them
was
a
piper
to
the
late
cluny
macpherson
of
cluny
of
at
this
point
michael
turned
the
trend
of
thoughts
to
the
nature
of
fairies
with
the
following
result
general
belief
of
the
people
here
during
my
father
lifetime
was
that
the
fairies
were
more
of
the
nature
of
spirits
than
of
men
made
of
flesh
and
blood
but
that
they
so
appeared
to
the
naked
eye
that
no
difference
could
be
marked
in
their
forms
from
that
of
any
human
being
except
that
they
were
more
diminutive
i
have
heard
my
father
say
it
was
the
case
that
fairy
women
used
to
take
away
children
from
their
cradles
and
leave
different
children
in
their
places
and
that
these
children
who
were
left
would
turn
out
to
be
old
men
barra
head
a
fairy
woman
used
to
come
to
a
man
window
almost
every
night
as
though
looking
to
see
if
the
family
was
home
the
man
grew
suspicious
and
decided
the
fairy
woman
was
watching
her
chance
to
steal
his
wife
so
he
proposed
a
plan
it
was
then
and
still
is
the
custom
after
thatching
a
house
to
rope
it
across
with
ropes
and
at
the
time
the
man
was
busy
spinning
some
of
them
and
he
told
his
wife
to
take
his
place
that
night
to
spin
the
and
said
he
would
take
her
they
were
thus
placed
when
the
fairy
woman
made
the
usual
look
in
at
the
window
and
she
seeing
that
her
intention
was
understood
said
to
the
man
you
are
yourself
at
the
and
your
wife
is
spinning
the
have
heard
it
said
that
the
fairies
live
in
knolls
on
a
higher
level
than
that
of
the
ground
in
general
and
that
fairy
songs
are
heard
from
the
faces
of
high
rocks
the
fairies
of
the
air
the
fairy
or
spirit
hosts
are
different
from
those
in
the
rocks
a
man
whom
i
seen
roderick
macneil
was
lifted
by
the
hosts
and
left
three
miles
from
where
he
was
taken
up
the
hosts
went
at
about
midnight
a
man
awake
at
midnight
is
in
danger
cows
and
horses
are
sometimes
shot
in
place
of
men
and
why
will
be
explained
by
later
witnesses
macdonald
we
then
asked
about
the
late
rev
donald
macdonald
who
had
the
reputation
of
knowing
all
about
fairies
and
spirits
when
he
lived
here
in
these
islands
and
john
said
have
heard
my
wife
say
that
she
questioned
father
macdonald
who
was
then
a
parish
priest
here
in
barra
and
for
whom
she
was
a
housekeeper
if
it
was
possible
that
such
beings
or
spirits
as
fairies
were
in
existence
he
said
yes
and
that
they
were
those
who
left
heaven
after
the
fallen
angels
and
that
those
going
out
after
the
fallen
angels
had
gone
out
were
so
numerous
and
kept
going
so
long
that
michael
notified
christ
that
the
throne
was
fast
emptying
and
when
christ
saw
the
state
of
affairs
he
ordered
the
doors
of
heaven
to
be
closed
at
once
saying
as
he
gave
the
order
who
is
out
is
out
and
who
is
in
is
in
and
the
fairies
are
as
numerous
now
as
ever
they
were
before
the
beginning
of
the
world
cf
pp
here
we
left
john
and
he
continuing
on
his
way
up
the
mountain
road
in
an
opposite
direction
from
us
and
round
a
turn
disappeared
almost
as
a
fairy
might
an
aged
piper
testimony
we
introduce
now
as
a
witness
donald
mckinnon
years
old
a
piper
by
profession
and
not
only
is
he
the
oldest
man
on
barra
but
also
the
oldest
man
among
all
our
witnesses
he
was
born
on
the
island
of
south
uist
one
of
the
western
hebrides
north
of
barra
and
came
to
barra
in
where
he
has
lived
ever
since
in
spite
of
being
four
years
less
than
a
hundred
in
age
he
greeted
us
very
heartily
and
as
he
did
not
wish
us
to
sit
inside
for
his
chimney
happened
not
to
be
drawing
very
well
and
was
filling
the
cottage
with
peat
smoke
we
sat
down
outside
on
the
grass
and
began
talking
and
as
we
came
to
fairies
this
is
what
he
said
of
believe
that
fairies
exist
as
a
tribe
of
spirits
and
appear
to
us
in
the
form
of
men
and
women
people
who
saw
fairies
can
yet
describe
them
as
they
appeared
dressed
in
green
no
doubt
there
are
fairies
in
other
countries
as
well
as
here
my
experience
there
was
always
a
good
deal
of
difference
between
the
fairies
and
the
hosts
the
fairies
were
supposed
to
be
living
without
material
food
whereas
the
hosts
were
supposed
to
be
living
upon
their
own
booty
generally
the
hosts
were
evil
and
the
fairies
good
though
i
have
heard
that
the
fairies
used
to
cattle
and
leave
their
old
men
rolled
up
in
the
hides
one
night
an
old
witch
was
heard
to
say
to
the
fairies
outside
the
fold
we
can
not
get
anything
the
old
men
who
were
left
behind
in
the
hides
of
the
animals
usually
disappeared
very
suddenly
i
saw
two
men
who
used
to
be
lifted
by
the
hosts
they
would
be
carried
from
south
uist
as
far
south
as
barra
head
and
as
far
north
as
harris
sometimes
when
these
men
were
ordered
by
the
hosts
to
kill
men
on
the
road
they
would
kill
instead
either
a
horse
or
a
cow
for
in
that
way
so
long
as
an
animal
was
killed
the
injunction
of
the
hosts
was
fulfilled
to
illustrate
at
this
point
the
idea
of
fairies
donald
repeated
the
same
legend
told
by
our
former
witness
john
campbell
about
the
emptying
of
heaven
and
the
doors
being
closed
to
keep
the
remainder
of
its
population
in
then
he
told
the
following
story
about
fairies
heard
of
an
apprentice
to
carpentry
who
was
working
with
his
master
at
the
building
of
a
boat
a
little
distance
from
his
house
and
near
the
sea
he
went
to
work
one
morning
and
forgot
a
certain
tool
which
he
needed
in
the
he
returned
to
his
to
get
it
and
found
the
shed
filled
with
fairy
men
and
women
on
seeing
him
they
ran
away
so
greatly
confused
that
one
of
the
women
forgot
her
gird
belt
and
he
picked
it
up
in
a
little
while
she
came
back
for
the
gird
and
asked
him
to
give
it
her
but
he
refused
to
do
so
thereupon
she
promised
him
that
he
should
be
made
master
of
his
trade
wherever
his
lot
should
fall
without
serving
further
apprenticeship
on
that
condition
he
gave
her
the
gird
and
rising
early
next
morning
he
went
to
the
yard
where
the
boat
was
and
put
in
two
planks
so
perfectly
that
when
the
master
arrived
and
saw
them
he
said
to
him
are
you
aware
of
anybody
being
in
the
last
night
for
i
see
by
the
work
done
that
i
am
more
likely
to
be
an
apprentice
than
the
person
who
put
in
those
two
planks
whoever
he
is
was
it
you
that
did
it
the
reply
was
in
the
affirmative
and
the
apprentice
told
his
master
the
circumstances
under
which
he
gained
the
rapid
mastership
of
his
trade
across
the
mountains
it
was
nearing
sunset
now
and
a
long
was
ahead
of
us
and
one
more
visit
that
evening
before
we
should
begin
our
return
to
castlebay
and
so
after
this
story
we
said
a
hearty
to
donald
with
regret
at
leaving
him
when
we
reached
the
one
of
the
rarest
of
barra
sights
greeted
us
to
the
north
and
south
in
the
golden
glow
of
a
september
twilight
we
saw
the
long
line
of
the
outer
hebrides
like
the
rocky
backbone
of
some
submerged
continent
the
scene
and
colours
on
the
land
and
ocean
and
in
the
sky
seemed
more
like
some
magic
vision
reflected
from
faerie
by
the
people
for
our
delight
than
a
thing
of
our
own
world
never
was
air
clearer
or
sea
calmer
nor
could
there
be
air
sweeter
than
that
in
the
mystic
holding
the
perfume
of
millions
of
tiny
blossoms
of
purple
and
white
heather
and
as
the
last
were
leaving
the
beautiful
blossoms
their
humming
came
to
our
ears
like
low
strange
music
from
fairyland
marian
maclean
of
barra
and
her
testimony
our
next
witness
to
testify
is
a
direct
descendant
of
the
ancient
macneils
of
barra
her
name
now
is
marian
maclean
and
she
lives
in
the
mountainous
centre
of
barra
at
upper
borve
she
is
many
years
younger
than
the
men
who
have
testified
and
one
of
the
most
industrious
women
on
the
island
it
was
already
dark
and
past
when
we
entered
her
cottage
and
so
as
we
sat
down
before
a
blazing
she
at
once
offered
us
some
hot
milk
and
biscuits
which
we
were
only
too
glad
to
accept
and
as
we
ate
we
talked
first
about
our
hard
climb
in
the
darkness
across
the
mountains
and
through
the
thick
and
then
about
the
big
rock
which
has
a
in
it
for
it
contains
a
secret
entrance
to
a
fairy
palace
we
had
examined
it
in
the
twilight
as
we
came
through
the
mountain
pass
which
it
guards
and
my
guide
michael
had
assured
me
that
more
than
one
islander
crossing
at
the
hour
we
were
had
seen
some
of
the
fairies
near
it
we
waited
in
front
of
the
big
rock
in
hopes
one
might
appear
for
our
benefit
but
in
spite
of
our
strong
belief
that
there
are
fairies
there
not
a
single
one
would
come
out
perhaps
they
came
and
we
could
see
them
who
knows
and
fairy
hosts
yes
marian
said
as
she
heard
michael
and
myself
talking
over
our
hot
milk
are
fairies
there
for
i
was
told
that
the
pass
was
a
notable
fairy
haunt
then
i
said
through
michael
you
tell
us
something
about
what
these
fairies
are
and
from
that
time
save
for
a
few
interruptions
natural
in
conversation
we
listened
and
marian
talked
and
told
stories
as
follows
the
fairies
are
to
be
seen
after
or
about
sunset
and
walk
on
the
ground
as
we
do
whereas
the
hosts
travel
in
the
air
above
places
inhabited
by
people
the
hosts
used
to
go
after
the
fall
of
night
and
more
particularly
about
midnight
you
hear
them
going
in
fine
weather
against
a
wind
like
a
covey
of
birds
and
they
were
in
the
habit
of
lifting
men
in
south
uist
for
the
hosts
need
men
to
help
in
shooting
their
javelins
from
their
bows
against
women
in
the
action
of
milking
cows
or
against
any
person
working
at
night
in
a
house
over
which
they
pass
and
i
have
heard
of
good
sensible
men
whom
the
hosts
took
shooting
a
horse
or
cow
in
place
of
the
person
ordered
to
be
shot
was
a
man
who
had
only
one
cow
and
one
daughter
the
daughter
was
milking
the
cow
at
night
when
the
hosts
were
passing
and
that
human
being
whom
the
hosts
had
lifted
with
them
was
her
father
neighbour
and
this
neighbour
was
ordered
by
the
hosts
to
shoot
the
daughter
as
she
was
milking
but
knowing
the
father
and
daughter
he
shot
the
cow
instead
the
next
morning
he
went
where
the
father
was
and
said
to
him
you
are
missing
the
cow
yes
said
the
father
i
am
and
the
man
who
had
shot
the
cow
said
are
you
not
glad
your
cow
and
not
your
daughter
was
for
i
was
ordered
to
shoot
your
daughter
and
i
shot
your
cow
in
order
to
show
blood
on
my
arrow
i
am
very
glad
of
what
you
have
done
if
that
was
the
case
the
father
replied
it
was
the
case
the
neighbour
said
father
and
grandfather
knew
a
man
who
was
carried
by
the
hosts
from
south
uist
here
to
barra
i
understand
when
the
hosts
take
away
earthly
men
they
require
another
man
to
help
them
but
the
hosts
must
be
spirits
my
opinion
is
that
they
are
both
spirits
of
the
dead
and
other
spirits
not
the
dead
a
child
was
taken
by
the
hosts
and
returned
after
one
night
and
one
day
and
found
at
the
back
of
the
house
with
the
palms
of
its
hands
in
the
holes
in
the
wall
and
with
no
life
in
its
body
it
was
dead
in
the
spirit
it
is
believed
that
when
people
are
dropped
from
a
great
height
by
the
hosts
they
are
killed
by
the
fall
as
to
fairies
my
firm
opinion
is
that
they
are
spirits
who
appear
in
the
shape
of
human
beings
the
question
was
now
asked
whether
the
fairies
were
anything
like
the
dead
and
marian
hesitated
about
answering
she
thought
they
were
like
the
dead
but
not
to
be
identified
with
them
the
idea
concerning
fairies
was
an
obstacle
she
could
not
pass
for
she
said
the
fallen
angels
were
cast
out
of
heaven
god
commanded
them
thus
you
will
go
to
take
up
your
abodes
in
crevices
under
the
earth
in
mounds
or
soil
or
rocks
and
according
to
this
command
they
have
been
condemned
to
inhabit
the
places
named
for
a
certain
period
of
time
and
when
it
is
expired
before
the
consummation
of
the
world
they
will
be
seen
as
numerous
as
ever
now
we
heard
two
good
stories
the
first
about
fairy
women
spinning
for
a
mortal
the
second
about
a
wonderful
changeling
who
was
a
magic
musician
have
heard
my
father
alexander
macneil
who
was
well
known
to
alexander
carmichael
and
to
campbell
of
islay
say
that
his
father
knew
a
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
have
her
stock
of
wool
spun
and
made
into
cloth
and
one
night
this
woman
secretly
wished
to
have
some
women
to
help
her
so
the
following
morning
there
appeared
at
her
house
six
or
seven
fairy
women
in
long
green
robes
all
alike
chanting
a
and
a
and
when
they
were
supplied
with
the
instruments
they
were
so
very
desirous
to
get
they
all
set
to
work
and
by
midday
of
that
morning
the
cloth
was
going
through
the
process
of
the
but
they
were
not
satisfied
with
finishing
the
work
the
woman
had
set
before
them
but
asked
for
new
employment
the
woman
had
no
more
spinning
or
weaving
to
be
done
and
began
to
wonder
how
she
was
to
get
the
women
out
of
the
house
so
she
went
into
her
neighbour
house
and
informed
him
of
her
position
in
regard
to
the
fairy
women
the
old
man
asked
what
they
were
saying
they
are
earnestly
petitioning
for
some
work
to
do
and
i
have
no
more
to
give
them
the
woman
replied
go
you
in
he
said
to
her
and
tell
them
to
spin
the
sand
and
if
then
they
do
not
move
from
your
house
go
out
again
and
yell
in
at
the
door
that
dun
borve
is
in
fire
the
first
plan
had
no
effect
but
immediately
on
hearing
the
cry
dun
borve
is
in
fire
the
fairy
women
disappeared
invisibly
and
as
they
went
the
woman
heard
the
melancholy
wail
dun
borve
is
in
fire
dun
borve
is
in
fire
and
what
will
become
of
our
hammers
and
anvil
for
there
was
a
smithy
in
the
tailor
and
the
was
a
young
wife
of
a
young
man
who
lived
in
the
township
of
allasdale
and
the
pair
had
just
had
their
first
child
one
day
the
mother
left
her
baby
in
its
cradle
to
go
out
and
do
some
shearing
and
when
she
returned
the
child
was
crying
in
a
most
unusual
fashion
she
fed
him
as
usual
on
porridge
and
milk
but
he
was
satisfied
with
what
seemed
to
her
enough
for
any
one
of
his
age
yet
every
suspicion
escaped
her
attention
as
it
happened
at
the
time
there
was
a
web
of
cloth
in
the
house
waiting
for
the
tailor
the
tailor
came
and
began
to
work
up
the
cloth
as
the
woman
was
going
out
to
her
customary
shearing
operation
she
warned
the
tailor
if
he
heard
the
child
continually
crying
not
to
pay
much
attention
to
it
adding
she
would
attend
to
it
when
she
came
home
for
she
feared
the
child
would
delay
him
in
his
work
went
well
till
about
noon
when
the
tailor
observed
the
child
rising
up
on
its
elbow
and
stretching
its
hand
to
a
sort
of
shelf
above
the
cradle
and
taking
down
from
it
a
yellow
chanter
of
a
bagpipe
and
then
the
child
began
to
play
immediately
after
the
child
began
to
play
the
chanter
the
house
filled
with
young
fairy
women
all
clad
in
long
green
robes
who
began
to
dance
and
the
tailor
had
to
dance
with
them
about
two
that
same
afternoon
the
women
disappeared
unknown
to
the
tailor
and
the
chanter
disappeared
from
the
hands
of
the
child
also
unknown
to
the
tailor
and
the
child
was
in
the
cradle
crying
as
usual
wife
came
home
to
make
the
dinner
and
observed
that
the
tailor
was
not
so
far
advanced
with
his
work
as
he
ought
to
be
in
that
space
of
time
however
when
the
fairy
women
disappeared
the
child
had
enjoined
upon
the
tailor
never
to
tell
what
he
had
seen
the
tailor
promised
to
be
faithful
to
the
child
injunctions
and
so
he
said
nothing
to
the
mother
second
day
the
wife
left
for
her
occupation
as
usual
and
told
the
tailor
to
be
more
attentive
to
his
work
than
the
day
before
a
second
time
at
the
same
hour
of
the
day
the
child
in
the
cradle
appearing
more
like
an
old
man
than
a
child
took
the
chanter
and
began
to
play
the
same
fairy
women
filled
the
house
again
and
repeated
their
dance
and
the
tailor
had
to
join
them
the
tailor
was
as
far
behind
with
his
work
the
second
day
as
the
first
day
and
it
was
very
noticeable
to
the
woman
of
the
house
when
she
returned
she
thereupon
requested
him
to
tell
her
what
the
matter
might
be
then
he
said
to
her
i
urge
upon
you
after
going
to
bed
not
to
fondle
that
child
because
he
is
not
your
child
nor
is
he
a
child
he
is
an
old
fairy
man
and
at
dead
tide
go
down
to
the
shore
and
wrap
him
in
your
plaid
and
put
him
upon
a
rock
and
begin
to
pick
that
which
is
called
limpet
and
for
your
life
do
not
leave
the
shore
until
such
a
time
as
the
tide
will
flow
so
high
that
you
will
scarcely
be
able
to
wade
in
to
the
main
shore
the
woman
complied
with
the
tailor
advice
and
when
she
had
waded
to
the
main
shore
and
stood
there
looking
at
the
child
on
the
rock
it
cried
to
her
you
had
a
great
need
to
do
what
you
have
done
otherwise
you
have
seen
another
ending
of
your
turn
but
blessing
be
to
you
and
curses
on
your
adviser
when
the
wife
arrived
home
her
own
natural
child
was
in
the
cradle
the
testimony
of
murdoch
maclean
the
husband
of
marian
maclean
had
entered
while
the
last
stories
were
being
told
and
when
they
were
ended
the
spirit
was
on
him
and
wishing
to
give
his
testimony
he
began
fairy
grandmother
catherine
macinnis
used
to
tell
about
a
man
named
lachlann
whom
she
knew
being
in
love
with
a
fairy
woman
the
fairy
woman
made
it
a
point
to
see
lachlann
every
night
and
he
being
worn
out
with
her
began
to
fear
her
things
got
so
bad
at
last
that
he
decided
to
go
to
america
to
escape
the
fairy
woman
as
soon
as
the
plan
was
fixed
and
he
was
about
to
emigrate
women
who
were
milking
at
sunset
out
in
the
meadows
heard
very
audibly
the
fairy
woman
singing
this
song
what
will
the
woman
do
when
lachlann
is
on
the
billows
emigrated
to
cape
breton
landing
in
nova
scotia
and
in
his
first
letter
home
to
his
friends
he
stated
that
the
same
fairy
woman
was
haunting
him
there
in
america
of
a
have
heard
it
from
old
people
that
a
couple
newly
married
were
on
their
way
to
the
home
of
the
father
and
for
some
unknown
reason
the
groom
fell
behind
the
procession
and
seeing
a
open
along
the
road
was
taken
into
it
no
one
could
ever
find
the
least
trace
of
where
he
went
and
all
hope
of
seeing
him
again
was
given
up
the
man
remained
with
the
fairies
so
long
that
when
he
returned
two
generations
had
disappeared
during
the
lapse
of
time
the
township
in
which
his
bride
house
used
to
be
was
depopulated
and
in
ruins
for
upwards
of
twenty
years
but
to
him
the
time
had
seemed
only
a
few
hours
and
he
was
just
as
fresh
and
youthful
as
when
he
went
in
the
of
previous
to
his
murdoch
had
heard
us
discussing
the
nature
and
powers
of
fairies
and
at
the
end
of
this
account
he
volunteered
without
our
asking
for
it
an
opinion
of
his
own
the
story
just
told
by
him
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
spirit
and
body
of
a
mortal
are
somehow
mystically
combined
by
fairy
enchantment
for
the
fairies
had
a
mighty
power
of
enchanting
natural
people
and
could
transform
the
physical
body
in
some
way
it
can
not
be
but
that
the
fairies
are
spirits
according
to
my
thinking
and
belief
they
can
not
be
anything
but
spirits
my
firm
belief
however
is
that
they
are
not
the
spirits
of
dead
men
but
are
the
fallen
angels
then
his
wife
marian
had
one
more
story
to
add
and
she
at
once
when
she
could
began
messenger
and
the
i
have
heard
the
following
incident
took
place
here
on
the
island
of
barra
about
one
hundred
years
ago
a
young
woman
taken
ill
suddenly
sent
a
messenger
in
all
haste
to
the
doctor
for
medicine
on
his
return
the
day
being
hot
and
there
being
five
miles
to
walk
he
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
a
knoll
and
fell
asleep
and
was
awakened
by
hearing
a
song
to
the
following
air
ho
ho
ho
hi
ho
ho
ill
it
becomes
a
messenger
on
an
important
message
to
sleep
on
the
ground
in
the
open
air
and
with
this
for
the
hour
was
late
and
dark
and
we
were
several
miles
from
castlebay
we
bade
our
good
friends
adieu
and
began
to
hunt
for
a
road
out
of
the
little
mountain
valley
where
murdoch
and
marian
guard
their
cows
and
sheep
and
all
the
way
to
the
hotel
michael
and
i
discussed
the
nature
of
fairies
just
before
midnight
we
saw
the
welcome
lights
in
castlebay
across
the
hills
and
we
both
entered
the
hotel
to
talk
there
was
a
blazing
fire
ready
for
us
and
something
to
eat
before
i
took
my
final
leave
of
my
friend
and
guide
i
asked
him
to
dictate
for
me
his
private
opinions
about
fairies
what
they
are
and
how
they
appear
to
men
and
he
was
glad
to
meet
my
request
here
is
what
he
said
about
the
famous
the
late
campbell
with
whom
he
often
worked
in
barra
and
for
himself
michael
buchanan
deposition
concerning
fairies
was
with
the
late
campbell
during
his
first
and
second
tour
of
the
island
of
barra
in
search
of
legendary
lore
strictly
connected
with
fairies
and
i
know
from
daily
conversing
with
him
about
fairies
that
he
held
them
to
be
spirits
appearing
to
the
naked
eye
of
the
spectator
as
any
of
the
present
or
former
generations
of
men
and
women
except
that
they
were
smaller
in
stature
and
i
know
equally
that
he
holding
them
to
be
spirits
thought
they
could
appear
or
disappear
at
will
my
own
firm
belief
is
that
the
fairies
were
or
are
only
spirits
which
were
or
are
seen
in
the
shape
of
human
beings
but
smaller
as
regards
stature
i
also
firmly
believe
in
the
existence
of
fairies
as
such
and
accept
the
modern
and
ancient
traditions
respecting
the
ways
and
customs
of
various
fairy
tribes
such
as
john
mackinnon
the
old
piper
and
john
campbell
and
the
macleans
told
us
and
i
therefore
have
no
hesitation
in
agreeing
with
the
views
held
by
the
late
campbell
regarding
fairies
the
reciters
lament
and
their
story
the
following
material
so
truly
celtic
in
its
and
in
the
profound
note
of
sadness
and
lamentation
dominating
it
may
very
appropriately
conclude
our
examination
of
the
of
scotland
by
giving
us
some
insight
into
the
mind
of
the
scotch
peasants
of
two
generations
ago
and
into
the
then
prevailing
happy
social
environment
under
which
their
belief
in
fairies
flourished
for
our
special
use
alexander
carmichael
has
rendered
it
out
of
the
original
gaelic
as
this
was
taken
down
by
him
in
various
versions
in
the
western
hebrides
one
version
was
recited
by
ann
macneill
of
barra
in
the
year
another
by
angus
macleod
of
harris
in
in
relation
to
their
belief
in
fairies
the
bias
of
the
reciters
is
worth
noting
as
a
curious
phenomenon
is
as
i
heard
when
a
hairy
little
fellow
upon
the
knee
of
my
mother
my
mother
was
full
of
stories
and
songs
of
music
and
chanting
my
two
ears
never
heard
musical
fingers
more
preferable
for
me
to
hear
than
the
chanting
of
my
mother
if
there
were
quarrels
among
children
as
there
were
and
as
there
will
be
my
beloved
mother
would
set
us
to
dance
there
and
then
she
herself
or
one
of
the
other
crofter
women
of
the
townland
would
sing
to
us
the
we
would
dance
there
till
we
were
seven
times
tired
a
stream
of
sweat
would
be
falling
from
us
before
we
stopped
hairful
little
lassies
and
stumpy
little
fellows
these
are
scattered
scattered
over
the
wide
world
the
people
of
those
times
were
full
of
music
and
dancing
stories
and
traditions
the
clerics
have
extinguished
these
may
ill
befall
them
and
what
have
the
clerics
put
in
their
place
beliefs
about
creeds
and
disputations
about
denominations
and
churches
may
lateness
be
their
lot
it
is
they
who
have
put
the
cross
round
the
heads
and
the
entanglements
round
the
feet
of
the
people
the
people
of
the
gaeldom
of
are
anear
perishing
for
lack
of
the
famous
feats
of
their
fathers
the
black
clerics
have
suppressed
every
noble
custom
among
the
people
of
the
gaeldom
precious
customs
that
will
never
return
no
never
again
return
now
follows
what
the
reciters
heard
upon
the
knee
of
their
mother
i
have
never
seen
a
man
fairy
nor
a
woman
fairy
but
my
mother
saw
a
troop
of
them
she
herself
and
the
other
maidens
of
the
townland
were
once
out
upon
the
summer
grazing
they
were
milking
the
cows
in
the
evening
gloaming
when
they
observed
a
flock
of
fairies
reeling
and
setting
upon
the
green
plain
in
front
of
the
knoll
and
oh
king
but
it
was
they
the
fairies
themselves
that
had
the
right
to
the
dancing
and
not
the
children
of
men
of
blue
silk
covered
their
heads
and
garments
of
green
satin
covered
their
bodies
and
sandals
of
yellow
membrane
covered
their
feet
their
heavy
brown
hair
was
streaming
down
their
waist
and
its
lustre
was
of
the
fair
golden
sun
of
summer
their
skin
was
as
white
as
the
swan
of
the
wave
and
their
voice
was
as
melodious
as
the
mavis
of
the
wood
and
they
themselves
were
as
beauteous
of
feature
and
as
lithe
of
form
as
a
picture
while
their
step
was
as
light
and
stately
and
their
minds
as
sportive
as
the
little
red
hind
of
the
hill
the
damsel
children
of
the
never
saw
sight
but
them
no
never
sight
but
them
never
aught
so
beautiful
there
is
not
a
wave
of
prosperity
upon
the
fairies
of
the
knoll
no
not
a
wave
there
is
no
growth
nor
increase
no
death
nor
withering
upon
the
fairies
seed
unfortunate
they
they
went
away
from
the
paradise
with
the
one
of
the
great
pride
when
the
father
commanded
the
doors
closed
down
and
up
the
intermediate
fairies
had
no
alternative
but
to
leap
into
the
holes
of
the
earth
where
they
are
and
where
they
will
be
is
what
i
heard
upon
the
knee
of
my
beloved
mother

that
the

was
a
peculiar
depository
of

on

became
in

chequered
with
those

more
direct
than
that

a

and

years
ago
he
talks
of

people
or
in
a
more
familiar
mood
of
and
of
or
fellas
in
contradistinction
to
mortals
he
calls
them
world
men
for
they
are
believed
to
dwell
in
a
world
of
their
own
being
neither
good
enough
for
heaven
nor
bad
enough
for
hell
at
the
present
moment
almost
all
the
older
manx
peasants
hold
to
this
belief
in
fairies
quite
firmly
but
with
a
certain
dread
of
them
and
to
my
knowledge
two
old
ladies
of
the
better
class
yet
leave
out
cakes
and
water
for
the
fairies
every
night
the
following
story
illustrative
of
the
belief
was
told
to
me
by
bill
clarke
while
i
was
fishing
from
a
ledge
of
rocks
that
runs
out
into
the
sea
at
a
dense
grey
mist
began
to
approach
the
land
and
i
thought
i
had
best
make
for
home
while
the
footpath
above
the
rocks
was
visible
when
getting
my
things
together
i
heard
what
sounded
like
a
lot
of
children
coming
out
of
school
i
lifted
my
head
and
behold
ye
there
was
a
fleet
of
fairy
boats
each
side
of
the
rock
their
were
shining
like
little
stars
and
i
heard
one
of
the
shout
boght
as
earish
broigh

poor
times
and
dirty
weather
and
herring
enough
at
the
people
of
this
world
nothing
at
us
then
they
dropped
off
and
went
agate
o
the
flitters
as
he
is
called
who
lives
at
rhenass
says
he
often
hears
the
fairies
singing
and
playing
up
the
glen
o
nights
i
have
heard
him
sing
airs
which
he
said
he
had
thus
learned
from
the
again
there
is
a
belief
that
at
keeill
moirrey
mary
church
near
glen
meay
a
little
old
woman
in
a
red
cloak
is
sometimes
seen
coming
over
the
mountain
towards
the
ringing
a
bell
just
about
the
hour
when
church
service
begins
keeill
moirrey
is
one
of
the
early
little
celtic
cells
probably
of
the
sixth
century
of
which
nothing
remains
but
the
foundations
and
the
following
prayer
surviving
to
our
own
epoch
is
most
interesting
it
shows
in
fact
pure
paganism
and
we
may
judge
from
it
that
the
ancient
manx
people
regarded
manannan
the
great
tuatha
de
danann
god
in
his
true
nature
as
a
spiritual
being
a
lord
of
the
sea
and
as
belonging
to
the
complex
fairy
hierarchy
this
prayer
was
given
to
me
by
a
manxwoman
nearly
one
hundred
years
old
who
is
still
living
she
said
it
had
been
used
by
her
grandfather
and
that
her
father
prayed
the
same
prayer
substituting
patrick
name
for
manannan

bless
us
and
our
boat
well
going
out
and
better
coming
in
with
living
and
dead
fish
in
the
boat
it
seems
to
me
that
no
one
of
the
various
theories
so
far
advanced
accounts
in
itself
for
the
there
is
always
a
missing
factor
an
unknown
quantity
which
has
yet
to
be
discovered
no
doubt
the
pygmy
theory
explains
a
good
deal
in
some
countries
a
tradition
has
been
handed
down
of
the
times
when
there
were
races
of
diminutive
men
in
existence
beings
so
small
that
their
tiny
hands
could
have
used
the
flint
and
scrapers
which
are
like
toys
to
us
no
such
tradition
exists
at
the
present
day
in
the
isle
of
man
but
one
might
have
filtered
down
from
the
ages
and
become
innate
in
the
and
now
unknown
to
the
manx
peasant
may
possibly
suggest
to
his
mind
the
troops
of
in
the
shadowy
glen
or
on
the
lonely
again
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
or
the
sough
of
the
wind
may
be
heard
by
the
peasant
as
strange
and
mysterious
voices
or
the
trembling
shadow
of
a
bush
may
appear
to
him
as
an
unearthly
being
natural
facts
explainable
by
modern
science
may
easily
remain
dark
mysteries
to
those
who
live
quiet
lives
close
to
nature
far
from
sophisticated
towns
and
whose
few
years
of
schooling
have
left
the
depths
of
their
being
undisturbed
only
as
it
were
ruffling
the
shallows
but
this
is
not
enough
even
let
it
be
granted
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
cases
of
experiences
with
fairies
can
be
analysed
and
explained
away
there
remains
the
tenth
in
this
tenth
case
one
is
obliged
to
admit
that
there
is
something
at
work
which
we
do
not
understand
some
force
in
play
which
as
yet
we
know
not
in
spite
of
ourselves
we
feel
powers
that
in
these
powers
are
not
necessarily
what
the
superstitious
call
we
realize
now
that
there
is
nothing
supernatural
that
what
used
to
be
so
called
is
simply
something
that
we
do
not
understand
at
present
our
forefathers
would
have
thought
the
telephone
the
and
wireless
telegraphy
things
it
is
more
than
possible
that
our
descendants
may
make
discoveries
equally
marvellous
in
the
realms
both
of
mind
and
matter
and
that
many
things
which
nowadays
seem
to
the
the
creations
of
credulous
fancy
may
in
the
future
be
understood
and
recognized
as
part
of
the
one
great
scheme
of
things
some
persons
are
certainly
more
susceptible
than
others
to
these
unknown
forces
most
people
know
reliable
instances
of
telepathy
and
presentiment
amongst
their
acquaintances
it
seems
not
at
all
contrary
to
reason
that
both
matter
and
mind
in
knowledge
of
which
we
have
not
gone
so
very
far
after
all
may
exist
in
forms
as
yet
entirely
unknown
to
us
after
all
beings
with
bodies
and
personalities
different
from
our
own
may
well
inhabit
the
unseen
world
around
us
the
fairy
hound
white
as
driven
snow
may
show
himself
at
times
among
his
mundane
companions
may
do
the
for
those
whom
he
favours
the
may
sing
and
dance
o
nights
in
colby
glen
let
us
not
say
it
is
peel
isle
of
man
on
the
slopes
of
south
barrule
i
was
introduced
to
the
ways
and
nature
of
manx
fairies
in
what
is
probably
the
most
part
of
the
isle
the
southern
slopes
of
south
barrule
the
mountain
on
whose
summit
manannan
is
said
to
have
had
his
stronghold
and
whence
he
worked
his
magic
hiding
the
kingdom
in
dense
fog
whenever
he
beheld
in
the
distance
the
coming
of
an
ship
or
fleet
and
from
a
representative
of
the
older
generation
samuel
leece
who
lives
at
ballamodda
a
pleasant
village
under
the
shadow
of
south
barrule
i
heard
the
first
story
and
table
moved
by
have
been
told
of
the
fairies
taking
babies
though
i
ca
be
sure
it
is
true
but
this
did
happen
to
my
own
mother
in
this
parish
of
kirk
patrick
about
eighty
years
since
she
was
in
bed
with
her
baby
but
wide
awake
when
she
felt
the
baby
pulled
off
her
arm
and
heard
the
rush
of
then
she
mentioned
the
almighty
name
and
as
were
hurrying
away
a
little
table
alongside
the
bed
went
round
about
the
floor
twenty
times
nobody
was
in
the
room
with
my
mother
and
she
always
allowed
it
was
the
manx
tales
in
a
when
our
interesting
conversation
was
over
leece
directed
me
to
her
son
where
her
husband
samuel
leece
then
happened
to
be
and
going
there
through
the
i
found
him
with
his
son
and
the
family
within
the
day
was
just
the
right
sort
to
stir
manx
memories
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
best
of
stories
about
the
people
were
being
told
in
the
most
natural
way
and
to
the
great
delight
of
the
children
the
grandfather
who
is
years
of
age
sat
by
the
open
fire
smoking
and
he
prepared
the
way
for
the
stories
three
of
which
we
record
by
telling
about
a
ghost
seen
by
himself
and
his
father
and
by
the
announcement
that
fairies
are
thought
to
be
spirits
fifty
years
ago
said
leece
the
son
taggart
my
wife
uncle
a
tailor
by
trade
had
for
an
apprentice
humphrey
keggan
a
young
man
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
of
age
and
it
often
happened
that
while
the
two
of
them
would
be
returning
home
at
nightfall
the
apprentice
would
suddenly
disappear
from
the
side
of
the
tailor
and
even
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
as
soon
as
they
had
crossed
the
burn
in
the
field
down
there
indicating
an
adjoining
field
and
taggart
could
not
see
nor
hear
humphrey
go
the
next
morning
humphrey
would
come
back
but
so
worn
out
that
he
could
not
work
and
he
always
declared
that
had
come
to
him
in
crowds
and
used
him
as
a
horse
and
that
with
them
he
had
travelled
all
night
across
fields
and
over
hedges
the
wife
of
the
narrator
substantiated
this
strange
psychological
story
by
adding
is
true
because
i
know
my
uncle
paul
too
well
to
doubt
what
he
says
and
she
then
related
the
two
following
stories
killed
by
fairy
woman
jane
was
coming
down
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
south
barrule
when
she
saw
a
strange
who
leece
suggested
was
a
witch
in
the
middle
of
the
gorse
and
walk
right
over
the
gorse
and
heather
in
a
place
where
no
person
could
walk
then
she
observed
the
woman
go
up
to
a
heifer
and
put
her
hand
on
it
and
within
a
few
days
that
heifer
was
dead
fairy
used
to
happen
about
one
hundred
years
ago
as
my
mother
has
told
me
where
my
grandfather
john
watterson
was
reared
just
over
near
kerroo
kiel
narrow
quarter
all
the
family
were
sometimes
sitting
in
the
house
of
a
cold
winter
night
and
my
great
grandmother
and
her
daughters
at
their
wheels
spinning
when
a
little
white
dog
would
suddenly
appear
in
the
room
then
every
one
there
would
have
to
drop
their
work
and
prepare
for
to
come
in
they
would
put
down
a
fire
and
leave
fresh
water
for
and
hurry
off
upstairs
to
bed
they
could
hear
come
but
could
never
see
them
only
the
dog
the
dog
was
a
fairy
dog
and
a
sure
sign
of
their
coming
testimony
of
a
and
seer
at
ballasalla
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
its
older
inhabitants
john
davies
a
celtic
who
can
cure
most
obstinate
maladies
in
men
or
animals
with
secret
herbs
and
who
knows
very
much
about
witchcraft
and
the
charms
against
it
are
as
common
as
ducks
walking
barefooted
he
said
using
the
duck
simile
which
is
a
popular
manx
one
and
he
cited
two
particular
instances
from
his
own
experience
but
for
us
it
is
more
important
to
know
that
john
davies
is
also
an
able
seer
the
son
of
a
weaver
he
was
born
in
county
down
ireland
years
ago
but
in
earliest
boyhood
he
came
with
his
people
to
the
isle
of
man
and
grew
up
in
the
country
near
ramsay
and
so
thoroughly
has
he
identified
himself
with
the
island
and
its
lore
and
even
with
its
ancient
language
that
for
our
purposes
he
may
well
be
considered
a
manxman
his
testimony
about
manx
fairies
is
as
follows
fairies
am
only
a
poor
ignorant
man
when
i
was
married
i
could
say
the
word
matrimony
in
the
right
way
but
one
does
not
have
to
be
educated
to
see
fairies
and
i
have
seen
them
many
a
time
i
have
seen
them
with
the
naked
eye
as
numerous
as
i
have
seen
scholars
coming
out
of
ballasalla
school
and
i
have
been
seeing
them
since
i
was
eighteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
the
last
one
i
saw
was
in
kirk
michael
before
education
came
into
the
island
more
people
could
see
the
fairies
now
very
few
people
can
see
them
but
the
fairies
are
as
thick
on
the
isle
of
man
as
ever
were
throng
the
air
and
darken
heaven
and
rule
this
lower
world
it
is
only
miles
from
this
world
up
to
the
first
heaven
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
fairies
as
populations
in
our
world
i
have
seen
some
who
were
about
two
and
a
half
feet
high
and
some
who
were
as
big
as
we
are
i
think
very
many
such
fairies
as
these
last
are
the
lost
souls
of
the
people
who
died
before
the
flood
at
the
flood
all
the
world
was
drowned
but
the
spirit
which
god
breathed
into
adam
will
never
be
drowned
or
burned
and
it
is
as
much
in
the
sea
as
on
the
land
others
of
the
fairies
are
evil
spirits
our
saviour
drove
a
legion
of
devils
into
a
herd
of
swine
the
swine
were
choked
but
not
the
devils
you
ca
drown
devils
it
is
spirits
they
are
and
just
like
a
shadow
on
the
wall
i
here
asked
about
the
personal
aspects
of
most
fairies
of
human
size
and
my
friend
said
appear
to
me
in
the
same
dress
as
in
the
days
when
they
lived
here
on
earth
the
spirit
itself
is
only
what
god
blew
into
adam
as
the
breath
of
life
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
whole
john
davies
has
had
genuine
visions
but
that
whatever
he
may
have
seen
has
been
very
much
coloured
in
interpretation
by
his
devout
knowledge
of
the
christian
bible
and
by
his
social
environment
as
is
testimony
of
a
ballasalla
manxwoman
a
manxwoman
of
ballasalla
who
lives
in
the
ancient
stone
house
wherein
she
was
born
and
in
which
before
her
lived
her
grandparents
offers
this
testimony
heard
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
fairies
but
never
believed
in
them
myself
the
old
people
thought
them
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
or
some
such
things
they
were
like
people
who
had
gone
before
that
is
dead
if
there
came
a
strange
sudden
knock
or
noises
or
if
a
tree
took
a
sudden
shaking
when
there
was
no
wind
people
used
to
make
out
it
was
caused
by
the
fairies
on
the
of
may
we
used
to
gather
with
red
berries
on
it
and
make
crosses
out
of
its
sprigs
and
put
them
over
the
doors
so
that
the
fairies
would
not
come
in
my
father
always
saw
that
this
was
done
he
said
we
could
have
no
luck
during
the
year
if
we
forgot
to
do
it
testimony
given
in
a
joiner
shop
george
gelling
of
ballasalla
a
joiner
has
a
local
reputation
for
knowing
much
about
the
fairies
and
so
i
called
on
him
at
his
workshop
this
is
what
he
told
me
the
was
making
a
coffin
here
in
the
shop
and
after
tea
my
apprentice
was
late
returning
he
was
out
by
the
hedge
just
over
there
looking
at
a
crowd
of
kicking
and
dancing
one
of
them
came
up
and
asked
him
what
he
was
looking
at
and
this
made
him
run
back
to
the
shop
when
he
described
what
he
had
seen
i
told
him
they
were
nothing
but
fairies
fairy
by
the
abbey
on
two
different
occasions
i
have
heard
the
fairies
they
were
playing
tunes
not
of
this
world
and
on
each
occasion
i
listened
for
nearly
an
hour
and
the
fairy
man
named
mickleby
was
coming
from
derbyhaven
at
night
when
by
a
certain
stream
he
met
two
ladies
he
saluted
them
and
then
walked
along
with
them
to
ballahick
farm
there
he
saw
a
house
lit
up
and
they
took
him
into
it
to
a
dance
as
he
danced
he
happened
to
wipe
away
his
sweat
with
a
part
of
the
dress
of
one
of
the
two
strange
women
who
was
his
partner
after
this
adventure
whenever
mickleby
was
lying
abed
at
night
the
woman
with
whom
he
danced
would
appear
standing
beside
his
bed
and
the
only
way
to
drive
her
away
was
to
throw
over
her
head
and
mickleby
a
linen
sheet
which
had
never
been
bleached
of
fairies
are
spirits
i
think
they
are
in
this
country
yet
a
man
below
here
forgot
his
cow
and
at
a
late
hour
went
to
look
for
her
and
saw
that
crowds
of
fairies
like
little
boys
were
with
him
paul
said
that
spirits
are
thick
in
the
air
if
only
we
could
see
them
and
we
call
spirits
fairies
i
think
the
old
people
here
in
the
island
thought
of
fairies
in
the
same
way
fairies
william
oates
now
happened
to
come
into
the
workshop
and
being
as
much
interested
in
the
subject
under
discussion
as
ourselves
offered
various
stories
of
which
the
following
is
a
type
man
named
watterson
who
used
often
to
see
the
fairies
in
his
house
at
colby
playing
in
the
moonlight
on
one
occasion
heard
them
coming
just
as
he
was
going
to
bed
so
he
went
out
to
the
spring
to
get
fresh
water
for
them
and
coming
into
the
house
put
the
can
down
on
the
floor
saying
now
little
beggars
drink
away
and
at
that
an
insult
to
the
fairies
the
water
was
suddenly
thrown
upon
him
a
vicar
testimony
when
i
called
on
the
rev
spicer
vicar
of
malew
parish
at
his
home
near
castletown
he
told
me
this
very
curious
story
taking
of
k
belief
in
fairies
is
quite
a
living
thing
here
yet
for
example
old
k
about
a
year
ago
told
me
that
on
one
occasion
when
her
daughter
had
been
in
castletown
during
the
day
she
went
out
to
the
road
at
nightfall
to
see
if
her
daughter
was
yet
in
sight
whereupon
a
whole
crowd
of
fairies
suddenly
surrounded
her
and
began
taking
her
off
toward
south
barrule
mountain
and
she
added
i
could
get
away
from
until
i
had
called
my
son
a
canon
testimony
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
the
rev
canon
kewley
of
arbory
for
the
valuable
testimony
which
follows
and
especially
for
his
kindness
in
allowing
me
to
record
what
is
one
of
the
clearest
examples
of
a
collective
hallucination
i
have
heard
about
as
occurring
in
the
regions
of
celtic
countries
collective
good
many
things
can
be
explained
as
natural
phenomena
but
there
are
some
things
which
i
think
can
not
be
for
example
my
sister
and
myself
and
our
coachman
and
apparently
the
horse
saw
the
same
phenomenon
at
the
same
moment
one
evening
we
were
driving
along
an
avenue
in
this
parish
when
the
avenue
seemed
to
be
blocked
by
a
great
crowd
of
people
like
a
funeral
procession
and
the
crowd
was
so
dense
that
we
could
not
see
through
it
the
throng
was
about
thirty
to
forty
yards
away
when
we
approached
it
melted
away
and
no
person
was
anywhere
in
sight
manx
the
old
people
of
this
parish
there
is
still
a
belief
in
fairies
about
eighteen
years
ago
i
buried
a
man
a
staunch
methodist
who
said
he
once
saw
the
road
full
of
fairies
in
the
form
of
little
black
pigs
and
that
when
he
addressed
them
in
the
name
of
god
what
are
ye
they
immediately
vanished
he
was
certain
they
were
the
fairies
other
old
people
speak
of
the
fairies
as
the
the
tradition
is
that
the
fairies
once
inhabited
this
island
but
were
banished
for
the
in
manx
is
supposed
to
be
inhabited
by
fairies
through
accident
one
night
a
woman
ran
into
such
a
tree
and
was
immediately
stricken
with
a
terrible
swelling
which
her
neighbours
declared
came
from
disturbing
the
fairies
in
the
tree
this
was
on
the
borders
of
arbory
parish
the
canon
favours
the
hypothesis
that
in
much
of
the
concerning
fairies
and
fairyland
there
is
present
an
instinct
as
seen
among
all
peoples
for
communion
with
the
other
world
and
that
this
instinct
shows
itself
in
another
form
in
the
christian
doctrine
of
the
communion
of
saints
fairy
tales
on
christmas
day
the
next
morning
christmas
morning
i
called
at
the
picturesque
roadside
home
of
dinah
moore
a
manxwoman
living
near
glen
meay
and
she
contributed
the
best
single
collection
of
manx
i
discovered
on
the
island
the
day
was
bright
and
frosty
and
much
snow
still
remained
in
the
shaded
nooks
and
hollows
so
that
a
seat
before
the
cheerful
fire
in
moore
cottage
was
very
comfortable
and
with
most
work
suspended
for
the
ancient
day
of
festivities
in
honour
of
the
sun
after
its
death
at
the
hands
of
the
powers
of
darkness
all
conditions
were
favourable
for
hearing
about
fairies
and
this
may
explain
why
such
important
results
were
obtained
heard
of
a
man
and
wife
who
had
no
children
one
night
the
man
was
out
on
horseback
and
heard
a
little
baby
crying
beside
the
road
he
got
off
his
horse
to
get
the
baby
and
taking
it
home
went
to
give
it
to
his
wife
and
it
was
only
a
block
of
wood
and
then
the
old
fairies
were
outside
yelling
at
the
man
un
oie
mollit
age
one
night
how
easily
thou
art
deceived
midwife
strange
strange
man
took
a
nurse
to
a
place
where
a
baby
boy
was
born
after
the
birth
the
man
set
out
on
a
table
two
cakes
one
of
them
broken
and
the
other
one
whole
and
said
to
the
nurse
eat
eat
but
do
eat
of
the
cake
which
is
broken
nor
of
the
cake
which
is
whole
and
the
nurse
said
what
in
the
name
of
the
lord
am
i
going
to
eat
at
that
all
the
fairies
in
the
house
disappeared
and
the
nurse
was
left
out
on
a
alone
night
the
fairies
came
into
a
house
in
glen
rushen
to
bake
the
family
had
put
no
water
out
for
them
and
a
who
had
been
left
lodging
on
the
sofa
downstairs
heard
the
fairies
say
we
have
no
water
so
we
take
blood
out
of
the
toe
of
the
servant
who
forgot
our
water
and
from
the
girl
blood
they
mixed
their
dough
then
they
baked
their
cakes
ate
most
of
them
and
poked
pieces
up
under
the
thatched
roof
the
next
day
the
fell
ill
and
was
ill
until
the
old
returned
to
the
house
and
cured
her
with
a
bit
of
the
cake
which
he
took
from
under
the
thatch
changeling
family
at
dalby
had
a
poor
idiot
baby
and
when
it
was
twenty
years
old
it
still
sat
by
the
fire
just
like
a
child
a
tailor
came
to
the
house
to
work
on
a
day
when
all
the
folks
were
out
cutting
corn
and
the
idiot
was
left
with
him
the
tailor
began
to
whistle
as
he
sat
on
the
table
sewing
and
the
little
idiot
sitting
by
the
fire
said
to
him
if
you
not
tell
anybody
when
they
come
in
i
dance
that
tune
for
you
so
the
little
fellow
began
to
dance
and
he
could
step
it
out
splendidly
then
he
said
to
the
tailor
if
not
tell
anybody
when
they
come
in
i
play
the
fiddle
for
you
and
the
tailor
and
the
idiot
spent
a
very
enjoyable
afternoon
together
but
before
the
family
came
in
from
the
fields
the
poor
idiot
as
usual
was
sitting
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
a
big
baby
who
could
hardly
talk
when
the
mother
came
in
she
happened
to
say
to
the
tailor
you
a
fine
chap
here
referring
to
the
idiot
yes
indeed
said
the
tailor
we
had
a
very
fine
afternoon
together
but
i
think
we
had
better
make
a
good
fire
and
put
him
on
it
oh
cried
the
mother
the
poor
child
could
never
even
walk
ah
but
he
can
dance
and
play
the
fiddle
too
replied
the
tailor
and
the
fire
was
made
but
when
the
idiot
saw
that
they
were
for
putting
him
on
it
he
pulled
from
his
pocket
a
ball
and
this
ball
went
rolling
on
ahead
of
him
and
he
going
after
it
was
never
seen
again
after
this
strange
story
was
finished
i
asked
moore
where
she
had
heard
it
and
she
said
have
heard
this
story
ever
since
i
was
a
girl
i
knew
the
house
and
family
and
so
did
my
mother
the
family
name
was
cubbon
fenodyree
or
snowy
weather
like
this
the
fenodyree
would
gather
in
the
sheep
at
night
and
during
the
harvest
season
would
do
the
threshing
when
all
the
family
were
abed
one
time
however
just
over
here
at
gordon
farm
the
farmer
saw
him
and
he
was
naked
and
so
the
farmer
put
out
a
new
suit
of
clothes
for
him
the
fenodyree
came
at
night
and
looking
at
the
clothes
with
great
disgust
at
the
idea
of
wearing
such
things
said

and
off
he
went
to
glen
rushen
for
good
testimony
from
the
keeper
of
peel
castle
from
moore
house
i
walked
on
to
peel
where
i
was
fortunate
in
meeting
in
his
own
home
william
cashen
the
keeper
of
the
famous
old
peel
castle
within
whose
yet
solid
battlements
stands
the
one
true
round
tower
outside
of
ireland
i
heard
first
of
all
about
the
fairy
dog
the
manx
for
black
dog
which
haunts
the
castle
and
then
cashen
related
to
me
the
following
anecdotes
and
tales
about
manx
fairies
against
the
father
and
grandfather
idea
was
that
the
fairies
tumbled
out
of
the
battlements
of
heaven
falling
earthward
for
three
days
and
three
nights
as
thick
as
hail
and
that
one
third
of
them
fell
into
the
sea
one
third
on
the
land
and
one
third
remained
in
the
air
in
which
places
they
will
remain
till
the
day
of
judgement
the
old
manx
people
always
believed
that
this
fall
of
the
fairies
was
due
to
the
first
sin
pride
and
here
is
their
prayer
against
the
fairies
saue
mee
voish

god
preserve
me
from
the
children
of
pride
or
ambition
man
two
ballaleece
woman
was
captured
by
the
fairies
and
soon
afterwards
her
husband
took
a
new
wife
thinking
the
first
one
gone
for
ever
but
not
long
after
the
marriage
one
night
the
first
wife
appeared
to
her
former
husband
and
said
to
him
and
the
second
wife
overheard
her
you
sweep
the
barn
clean
and
mind
there
is
not
one
straw
left
on
the
floor
then
stand
by
the
door
and
at
a
certain
hour
a
company
of
people
on
horseback
will
ride
in
and
you
lay
hold
of
that
bridle
of
the
horse
i
am
on
and
do
let
it
go
he
followed
the
directions
carefully
but
was
unable
to
hold
the
horse
the
second
wife
had
put
some
straw
on
the
barn
floor
under
a
bushel
of
dalby
mountain
this
side
of
the
old
manx
people
used
to
put
their
ears
to
the
earth
to
hear
the
sounds
of
infinity
which
were
sounds
like
murmurs
they
thought
these
sounds
came
from
beings
in
space
for
in
their
belief
all
space
is
filled
with
invisible
beings
to
the
memory
of
a
manx
scholar
since
the
following
testimony
was
written
down
its
author
the
late
john
nelson
of
ramsey
has
passed
out
of
our
realm
of
life
into
the
realm
invisible
he
was
one
of
the
few
manxmen
who
knew
the
manx
language
really
well
and
the
ancient
traditions
which
it
has
preserved
both
orally
and
in
books
in
his
kindly
manner
and
with
fervent
loyalty
toward
all
things
celtic
he
gave
me
leave
during
december
to
publish
for
the
first
time
the
interesting
matter
which
follows
and
with
reverence
we
here
place
it
on
record
to
his
memory
blinding
by
grandfather
william
nelson
was
coming
home
from
the
herring
fishing
late
at
night
on
the
road
near
jurby
when
he
saw
in
a
across
a
hedge
a
great
crowd
of
in
red
coats
dancing
and
making
music
and
as
he
looked
an
old
woman
from
among
them
came
up
to
him
and
spat
in
his
eyes
saying
you
never
see
us
again
and
i
am
told
that
he
was
blind
afterwards
till
the
day
of
his
death
he
was
certainly
blind
for
fourteen
years
before
his
death
for
i
often
had
to
lead
him
around
but
of
course
i
am
unable
to
say
of
my
own
knowledge
that
he
became
blind
immediately
after
his
strange
experience
or
if
not
until
later
in
life
but
as
a
young
man
he
certainly
had
good
sight
and
it
was
believed
that
the
fairies
destroyed
it
fairy
cain
of
glen
helen
formerly
rhenass
was
going
home
in
the
evening
across
the
mountains
near
brook
park
when
he
heard
music
down
below
in
a
glen
and
saw
there
a
great
glass
house
like
a
palace
all
lit
up
he
stopped
to
listen
and
when
he
had
the
new
tune
he
went
home
to
practise
it
on
his
fiddle
and
recently
he
played
the
same
fairy
tune
at
miss
sophia
morrison
manx
entertainment
in
peel
the
nelson
told
a
story
about
a
or
such
as
we
already
have
and
explained
the
as
a
supposed
to
be
a
goblin
half
cow
and
half
horse
and
then
offered
this
tradition
about
manannan
is
said
that
manannan
was
a
great
magician
and
that
he
used
to
place
on
the
sea
held
open
with
sticks
and
with
sticks
for
masts
standing
up
in
them
and
then
so
magnify
them
that
enemies
beheld
them
as
a
strong
fleet
and
would
not
approach
the
island
another
tradition
is
that
manannan
on
his
three
legs
the
manx
coat
of
arms
could
travel
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
his
isle
with
wonderful
swiftness
moving
like
a
wheel
testimony
of
a
farmer
and
fisherman
from
the
north
of
the
island
i
returned
to
peel
where
i
had
arranged
to
meet
new
witnesses
and
the
first
one
of
these

i
was
a

our
family
often
used
to
hear
the
empty
churn
working
in
the
when
no
person
was
near
it
and
they
would
say
oh
the
remarkable
changeling

fifty
years
ago
between
john

foxdale
a
boy
with
whom
i
often
played
came
to
our
house
at
nightfall
to
borrow
some
candles
and
while
he
was
on
his
way
home
across
the
hills
he
suddenly
saw
a
little
boy
and
a
little
woman
coming
after
him
if
he
ran
they
ran
and
all
the
time
they
gained
on
him
upon
reaching
home
he
was
speechless
his
hands
were
altered
turned
awry
and
his
feet
also
and
his
fingernails
had
grown
long
in
a
minute
he
remained
that
way
a
week
my
father
went
to
the
boy
mother
and
told
her
it
was
robby
at
all
that
she
saw
and
when
my
father
was
for
taking
the
tongs
and
burning
the
boy
with
a
piece
of
glowing
turf
as
a
changeling
test
the
boy
screamed
awfully
then
my
father
persuaded
the
mother
to
send
a
messenger
to
a
doctor
in
the
north
near
ramsey
doing
charms
to
see
if
she
could
get
robby
back
as
the
messenger
was
returning
the
mother
stepped
out
of
the
house
to
relieve
him
and
when
she
went
into
the
house
again
her
own
robby
was
there
as
soon
as
robby
came
to
himself
all
right
he
said
a
little
woman
and
a
little
boy
had
followed
him
and
that
just
as
he
got
home
he
was
conscious
of
being
taken
away
by
them
but
he
did
know
where
they
came
from
nor
where
they
took
him
he
was
unable

kindly
dictated
for
my
use
the
following
statement
concerning
fairies
which
he
himself
has
seen
of
is
much
belief
here
in
the
island
that
there
actually
are
fairies
and
i
consider
such
belief
based
on
an
actual
fact
in
nature
because
of
my
own
strange
experience
about
forty
years
ago
one
october
night
i
and
another
young
man
were
going
to
a
kind
of
manx
at
on
the
glen
helen
road
just
at
the
beary
farm
as
we
walked
along
talking
my
friend
happened
to
look
across
the
river
a
small
brook
and
said
oh
look
there
are
the
fairies
did
you
ever
see
them
i
looked
across
the
river
and
saw
a
circle
of
supernatural
light
which
i
have
now
come
to
regard
as
the
astral
light
or
the
light
of
nature
as
it
is
called
by
mystics
and
in
which
spirits
become
visible
the
spot
where
the
light
appeared
was
a
flat
space
surrounded
on
the
sides
away
from
the
river
by
banks
formed
by
low
hills
and
into
this
space
and
the
circle
of
light
from
the
surrounding
sides
apparently
i
saw
come
in
twos
and
threes
a
great
crowd
of
little
beings
smaller
than
tom
thumb
and
his
wife
all
of
them
who
appeared
like
soldiers
were
dressed
in
red
they
moved
back
and
forth
amid
the
circle
of
light
as
they
formed
into
order
like
troops
drilling
i
advised
getting
nearer
to
them
but
my
friend
said
no
going
to
the
party
then
after
we
had
looked
at
them
a
few
minutes
my
friend
struck
the
roadside
wall
with
a
stick
and
shouted
and
we
lost
the
vision
and
the
light
vanished
manx
have
much
evidence
from
old
manx
people
who
are
entirely
reliable
and
that
they
have
seen
the
fairies
hunting
with
hounds
and
horses
and
on
the
sea
in
ships
and
under
other
conditions
and
that
they
have
heard
their
music
they
consider
the
fairies
a
complete
nation
or
world
in
themselves
distinct
from
our
world
but
having
habits
and
instincts
like
ours
social
organization
among
them
is
said
to
be
similar
to
that
among
men
and
they
have
their
soldiers
and
commanders
where
the
fairies
actually
exist
the
old
people
can
not
tell
but
they
certainly
believe
that
they
can
be
seen
here
on
earth

a
resident
of
douglas
offers
the
following
account
of
a
curious
psychical
experience
of
his
own
and
attributes
it
to
fairies
strange
experience
with
to
thirteen
years
ago
on
a
clear
moonlight
night
about
twelve
i
left
laxey
and
when
about
five
miles
from
douglas
at
ballagawne
school
i
heard
talking
and
was
suddenly
conscious
of
being
in
the
midst
of
an
invisible
throng
as
this
strange
feeling
came
over
me
i
saw
coming
up
the
road
four
figures
as
real
to
look
upon
as
human
beings
and
of
medium
size
though
i
am
certain
they
were
not
human
when
these
four
who
seemed
to
be
connected
with
the
invisible
throng
came
out
of
the
garwick
road
into
the
main
road
i
passed
into
a
leading
down
to
a
very
peaceful
glen
called
garwick
glen
and
i
still
had
the
same
feeling
that
invisible
beings
were
with
me
and
this
continued
for
a
mile
there
was
no
fear
or
emotion
or
excitement
but
perfect
calm
on
my
part
i
followed
the
and
when
i
began
to
mount
a
hill
there
was
a
sudden
and
strange
quietness
and
a
sense
of
isolation
came
over
me
as
though
the
joy
and
peace
of
my
life
had
departed
with
the
invisible
throng
from
different
personal
experiences
like
this
one
i
am
firmly
of
the
opinion
and
belief
that
the
fairies
exist
one
can
not
say
that
they
are
wholly
physical
or
wholly
spiritual
but
the
impression
left
upon
my
mind
is
that
they
are
an
absolutely
real
order
of
beings
not
human
invoking
little
manannan
son
of
leirr
to
give
us
safe
passage
across
his
watery
domain
we
now
go

nearest
brythonic
country

sir
john
rhŷs

of
the
university
of
edinburgh
professor
of
celtic
in
the
university
of
oxford
principal
of
jesus
college
author
of
folklore
welsh
and
the
of
wales
in
as
far
as
it
concerns
the
fairies
consists
of
a
very
few
typical
tales
such
as
the
fairy
dance
and
the
usual
entrapping
of
a
youth
who
dances
with
the
little
people
for
a
long
time
while
he
supposes
it
only
a
few
minutes
and
who
if
not
rescued
is
taken
by
them
there
are
other
ways
in
which
recruits
may
be
led
into
fairyland
and
induced
to
marry
fairy
maidens
and
any
one
so
led
away
is
practically
lost
to
his
kith
and
kin
for
even
if
he
be
allowed
to
visit
them
the
visit
is
mostly
cut
short
in
one
way
or
another
a
man
catches
a
fairy
woman
and
marries
her
she
proves
to
be
an
excellent
housewife
but
usually
she
has
had
put
into
the
certain
conditions
which
if
broken
inevitably
release
her
from
the
union
and
when
so
released
she
hurries
away
instantly
never
to
return
unless
it
be
now
and
then
to
visit
her
children
one
of
the
conditions
especially
in
north
wales
is
that
the
husband
should
never
touch
her
with
iron
but
in
the
story
of
the
lady
of
llyn
y
fan
fach
in
carmarthenshire
the
condition
is
that
he
must
not
strike
the
wife
without
a
cause
three
times
the
striking
being
interpreted
to
include
any
slight
tapping
say
on
the
shoulder
this
story
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
on
record
in
wales
and
it
recalls
the
famous
tale
of
undine
published
in
german
many
years
ago
by
de
la
motte
fouqué
it
is
not
known
where
he
found
it
or
whether
the
people
among
whom
it
was
current
were
pure
germans
or
of
celtic
extraction
the
fairies
were
fond
of
stealing
nice
healthy
babies
and
of
leaving
in
their
place
their
own
sallow
offspring
the
stories
of
how
the
right
child
might
be
recovered
take
numerous
forms
and
some
of
these
stories
suggest
how
weak
and
sickly
children
became
the
objects
of
systematic
cruelty
at
the
hands
of
even
their
own
parents
the
changeling
was
usually
an
old
man
and
many
were
the
efforts
made
to
get
him
to
betray
his
identity
there
is
a
widespread
story
of
the
fairy
husband
procuring
for
his
wife
the
attendance
of
a
human
midwife
the
latter
was
given
a
certain
ointment
to
apply
to
the
baby
eyes
when
she
dressed
it
she
was
not
to
touch
either
of
her
own
eyes
with
it
but
owing
to
an
unfailing
accident
she
does
and
with
the
eye
so
touched
she
is
enabled
to
see
the
fairies
in
their
proper
shape
and
form
this
has
consequences
the
fairy
husband
pays
the
midwife
well
and
discharges
her
she
goes
to
a
fair
or
market
one
day
and
observes
her
old
master
stealing
goods
from
a
stall
and
makes
herself
known
to
him
he
asks
her
with
which
eye
she
sees
him
she
tells
him
and
the
eye
to
which
he
objects
he
instantly
blinds
many
are
the
stories
about
the
fairies
coming
into
houses
at
night
to
wash
and
dress
their
children
after
everybody
is
gone
to
bed
a
who
knows
her
business
leaves
a
vessel
full
of
water
for
them
and
takes
care
that
the
house
is
neat
and
tidy
and
she
then
probably
finds
in
the
morning
some
fairy
gift
left
her
whereas
if
the
house
be
untidy
and
the
water
dirty
they
will
pinch
her
in
her
sleep
and
leave
her
black
and
blue
the
fairies
were
not
strong
in
their
household
arrangements
so
it
was
not
at
all
unusual
for
them
to
come
to
the
to
borrow
what
was
wanting
to
them
in
the
neighbourhood
of
snowdon
the
fairies
were
believed
to
live
beneath
the
lakes
from
which
they
sometimes
came
forth
especially
on
misty
days
and
children
used
to
be
warned
not
to
stray
away
from
their
homes
in
that
sort
of
weather
lest
they
should
be
kidnapped
by
them
these
fairies
were
not
christians
and
they
were
great
thieves
they
were
fond
of
bright
colours
they
were
sharp
of
hearing
and
no
word
that
reached
the
wind
would
escape
them
if
a
fairy
proper
name
was
discovered
the
fairy
to
whom
it
belonged
felt
baffled
some
characteristics
of
the
fairies
seem
to
argue
an
ancient
race
while
other
characteristics
betray
their
origin
in
the
workshop
of
the
imagination
but
generally
speaking
the
fairies
are
heterogeneous
consisting
partly
of
the
divinities
of
glens
and
forests
and
mountains
and
partly
of
an
early
race
of
men
more
or
less
caricatured
and
equipped
by
fable
with
impossible
attributes

folk
in

or
mona
the
ancient
stronghold
of

druids
we
shall
see
clearly
that
the
testimony
offered
by
thoroughly
reliable
and
prominent
native
witnesses
is
surprisingly
uniform
and
essentially
animistic
in
its
nature
and
in
passing
southward
to
the
end
of
wales
we
shall
find
the

with
this

uniformity
and
exhibiting

testimony
of
an
anglesey
bard
john
louis
jones
of
gaerwen
anglesey
a
native
bard
who
has
taken
prizes
in
various
eisteddfods
testifies
as
follows
teg
i
was
a
boy
here
on
the
island
the
were
described
as
a
race
of
little
beings
no
larger
than
children
six
or
seven
years
old
who
visited
at
night
after
all
the
family
were
abed
no
matter
how
securely
closed
a
house
might
be
the
had
no
trouble
to
get
in
i
remember
how
the
old
folk
used
to
make
the
house
comfortable
and
put
fresh
coals
on
the
fire
saying
perhaps
the
will
come
then
the
when
they
did
come
would
look
round
the
room
and
say
what
a
clean
beautiful
place
this
is
and
all
the
while
the
old
folk
in
bed
were
listening
before
departing
from
such
a
clean
house
the
always
left
a
valuable
present
for
the
family
wife
and
iron
young
man
once
caught
one
of
the
women
and
she
agreed
to
live
with
him
on
condition
that
he
should
never
touch
her
with
iron
one
day
she
went
to
a
field
with
him
to
catch
a
horse
but
in
catching
the
horse
he
threw
the
bridle
in
such
a
way
that
the
bit
touched
the
woman
and
all
at
once
she
was
gone
as
this
story
indicates
the
could
make
themselves
invisible
i
think
they
could
be
seen
by
some
people
and
not
by
other
people
the
old
folk
thought
them
a
kind
of
spirit
race
from
a
spirit
world
evidence
from
central
anglesey
owing
to
the
very
kindly
assistance
of
thomas
of
llangefni
who
introduced
me
to
the
oldest
inhabitants
of
his
town
in
their
own
homes
and
elsewhere
and
then
acted
as
interpreter
whenever
welsh
alone
was
spoken
i
gleaned
very
clear
evidence
from
that
part
of
central
anglesey
seven
witnesses
two
of
whom
were
women
ranging
in
age
from
to
years
were
thus
interviewed
and
each
of
them
stated
that
in
their
childhood
the
belief
in
the
as
a
race
of
good
little
people
by
one
witness
compared
to
singing
angels
was

jones
the
oldest
of
the
seven

much
else
said
in

believe
personally
that
the
are
still
existing
but
people
ca
see
them
i
have
heard
of
two
or
three
persons
being
together
and
one
only
having
been
able
to
see
the
testimony
from
two
anglesey
centenarians
perhaps
nowhere
else
in
celtic
lands
could
there
be
found
as
witnesses
two
sisters
equal
in
age
to
miss
mary
owen
and
betsy
thomas
in
their
hundred
and
third
and

year
respectively
in
they
live
a

life
on

in
the
beautiful
country
near
pentraeth
quite
away
from
the
rush
and
noise
of
the
great
world
of

activity
and
they
speak
only

their

spoke

jones
of
plas
tinon
their
neighbour
who
knows
english
and
welsh
well
acted
as
interpreter
the
elder
sister
testified
first
teg
were
many
of
the
on
the
llwydiarth
mountain
above
here
and
round
the
llwydiarth
lake
where
they
used
to
dance
and
whenever
the
prices
at
the
llangefni
market
were
to
be
high
they
would
chatter
very
much
at
night
they
appeared
only
after
dark
and
all
the
good
they
ever
did
was
singing
and
dancing
ann
jones
whom
i
knew
very
well
used
often
to
see
the
dancing
and
singing
but
if
she
then
went
up
to
them
they
would
disappear
she
told
me
they
are
an
invisible
people
and
very
small
many
others
besides
ann
jones
have
seen
the
in
these
mountains
and
have
heard
their
music
and
song
the
ordinary
opinion
was
that
the
are
a
race
of
spirits
i
believe
in
them
as
an
invisible
race
of
good
little
people
midwife
and
magic
had
a
kind
of
magic
oil
and
i
remember
this
story
about
it
a
farmer
went
to
llangefni
to
fetch
a
woman
to
nurse
his
wife
about
to
become
a
mother
and
he
found
one
of
the
who
came
with
him
on
the
back
of
his
horse
arrived
at
the
the
fairy
woman
looked
at
the
wife
and
giving
the
farmer
some
oil
told
him
to
wash
the
baby
in
it
as
soon
as
it
was
born
then
the
fairy
woman
disappeared
the
farmer
followed
the
advice
and
what
did
he
do
in
washing
the
baby
but
get
some
oil
on
one
of
his
own
eyes
suddenly
he
could
see
the
for
the
oil
had
given
him
the
some
time
later
the
farmer
was
in
llangefni
again
and
saw
the
same
fairy
woman
who
had
given
him
the
oil
how
is
your
wife
getting
on
she
asked
him
she
is
getting
on
very
well
he
replied
then
the
fairy
woman
added
tell
me
with
which
eye
you
see
me
best
with
this
one
he
said
pointing
to
the
eye
he
had
rubbed
with
the
oil
and
the
fairy
woman
put
her
stick
in
that
eye
and
the
farmer
never
saw
with
it
again
the
younger
sister
testimony
is
as
follows
saw
one
of
the
about
sixty
years
ago
near
the
tynymyndd
farm
as
i
was
passing
by
at
night
he
was
like
a
little
man
when
i
approached
him
he
disappeared
suddenly
i
have
heard
about
the
dancing
and
singing
of
the
but
never
have
heard
the
music
myself
the
old
people
said
the
could
appear
and
disappear
when
they
liked
and
i
think
as
the
old
people
did
that
they
are
some
sort
of
spirits
testimony
from
an
anglesey
seeress
at
pentraeth
gwilyn
jones
said
to
me
always
was
and
still
is
the
opinion
that
the
are
a
race
of
spirits
some
people
think
them
small
in
size
but
the
one
my
mother
saw
was
ordinary
human
size
at
this
i
immediately
asked
jones
if
his
mother
was
still
living
and
he
replying
that
she
was
gave
me
her
address
in
llanfair
so
i
went
directly
to
interview
jones
mother
catherine
jones
and
this
is
the
story
about
the
one
of
the
she
saw
teg
was
coming
home
at
about
ten
at
night
from
cemaes
on
the
path
to
simdda
wen
where
i
was
in
service
when
there
appeared
just
before
me
a
very
pretty
young
lady
of
ordinary
size
i
had
no
fear
and
when
i
came
up
to
her
put
out
my
hand
to
touch
her
but
my
hand
and
arm
went
right
through
her
form
i
could
not
understand
this
and
so
tried
to
touch
her
repeatedly
with
the
same
result
there
was
no
solid
substance
in
the
body
yet
it
remained
beside
me
and
was
as
beautiful
a
young
lady
as
i
ever
saw
when
i
reached
the
door
of
the
house
where
i
was
to
stop
she
was
still
with
me
then
i
said
good
night
to
her
no
response
being
made
i
asked
why
do
you
not
speak
and
at
this
she
disappeared
nothing
happened
afterwards
and
i
always
put
this
beautiful
young
lady
down
as
one
of
the
there
was
much
talk
about
my
experience
when
i
reported
it
and
the
neighbours
like
myself
thought
i
had
seen
one
of
the
i
was
about
years
old
at
the
time
of
this
incident
testimony
from
a
professor
of
welsh
just
before
crossing
the
menai
straits
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
at
his
home
in
llanfair
morris
jones
oxon
professor
of
welsh
in
the
university
college
at
bangor
and
he
speaking
of
the
in
anglesey
as
he
remembers
it
from
boyhood
days
said
teg
most
of
the
tales
i
heard
repeated
when
i
was
a
boy
i
am
quite
certain
the
implication
was
that
the
were
a
kind
of
spirit
race
having
human
characteristics
who
could
at
will
suddenly
appear
and
suddenly
disappear
they
were
generally
supposed
to
live
underground
and
to
come
forth
on
moonlight
nights
dressed
in
gaudy
colours
chiefly
in
red
to
dance
in
circles
in
grassy
fields
i
can
not
remember
having
heard
changeling
stories
here
in
the
island
i
think
the
were
generally
looked
upon
as
kind
and
though
revengeful
if
not
well
treated
and
they
were
believed
to
have
plenty
of
money
at
their
command
which
they
could
bestow
on
people
whom
they
liked
evidence
from
north
carnarvonshire
upon
leaving
anglesey
i
undertook
some
investigation
of
the
welsh
in
the
country
between
bangor
and
carnarvon
from
the
oldest
welsh
people
of
treborth
i
heard
the
same
sort
of
as
we
have
recorded
from
anglesey
except
that
prominence
was
given
to
a
flourishing
belief
in
goblins
or
bogies
but
from
davis
evans
of
port
dinorwic
i
heard
the
following
very
unusual
story
based
on
facts
as
he
recalled
it
first
hand
jones
who
some
sixty
years
ago
declared
he
had
seen
the
in
the
aberglaslyn
pass
near
beddgelert
was
publicly
questioned
about
them
in
bethel
chapel
by
griffiths
the
minister
and
he
explained
before
the
congregation
that
the
lord
had
given
him
a
special
vision
which
enabled
him
to
see
the
and
that
therefore
he
had
seen
them
time
after
time
as
little
men
playing
along
the
river
in
the
pass
the
minister
induced
jones
to
repeat
the
story
many
times
because
it
seemed
to
please
the
congregation
very
much
and
the
folks
present
looked
upon
jones
vision
as
a
most
wonderful
thing
evidence
from
south
carnarvonshire
to
rowlands
head
master
of
the
schools
at
afonwen
i
am
indebted
for
a
summary
of
the
in
south
carnarvonshire
teg
to
the
belief
in
south
carnarvonshire
the
were
a
small
very
pretty
people
always
dressed
in
white
and
much
given
to
dancing
and
singing
in
rings
where
grass
grew
as
a
rule
they
were
visible
only
at
night
though
in
the
if
a
mother
while
was
so
unwise
as
to
leave
her
babe
alone
in
the
field
the
might
take
it
and
leave
in
its
place
a
hunchback
or
some
deformed
object
like
a
child
at
night
the
would
entice
travellers
to
join
their
dance
and
then
play
all
sorts
of
tricks
on
them
cows
and
fairy
of
the
lived
in
caves
others
of
them
lived
in
there
is
a
lake
called
llyn
y
morwynion
or
lake
of
the
maidens
near
festiniog
where
as
the
story
goes
a
farmer
one
morning
found
in
his
field
a
number
of
very
fine
cows
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
not
knowing
where
they
came
from
he
kept
them
a
long
time
when
as
it
happened
he
committed
some
dishonest
act
and
as
a
result
women
of
the
made
their
appearance
in
the
pasture
and
calling
the
cows
by
name
led
the
whole
herd
into
the
lake
and
with
them
disappeared
beneath
its
waters
the
old
people
never
could
explain
the
nature
of
the
but
they
always
regarded
them
as
a
very
mysterious
race
and
according
to
this
story
of
the
cattle
as
a
supernatural
race
evidence
from
merionethshire
louis
foster
edwards
of
harlech
recalling
the
memories
of
many
years
ago
offers
the
following
evidence
and
an
old
inn
on
the
other
side
of
harlech
there
was
to
be
an
entertainment
and
as
usual
on
such
occasions
the
dancing
would
not
cease
until
morning
i
noticed
before
the
guests
had
all
arrived
that
the
landlady
was
putting
edge
upwards
up
into
the
large
chimney
and
wondering
why
it
was
asked
her
she
told
me
that
the
fairies
might
come
before
the
entertainment
was
over
and
that
if
the
blades
were
turned
edge
upwards
it
would
prevent
the
fairies
from
troubling
the
party
for
they
would
be
unable
to
pass
the
blades
without
being
cut
teg
and
their
was
an
idea
that
the
lived
by
plundering
at
night
it
was
thought
too
that
if
anything
went
wrong
with
cows
or
horses
the
were
to
blame
as
a
race
the
were
described
as
having
the
power
of
invisibility
and
it
was
believed
they
could
disappear
like
a
spirit
while
one
happened
to
be
observing
them
the
world
in
which
they
lived
was
a
world
quite
unlike
ours
and
mortals
taken
to
it
by
them
were
changed
in
nature
the
way
a
mortal
might
be
taken
by
the
was
by
being
attracted
into
their
dance
if
they
thus
took
you
away
it
would
be
according
to
our
time
for
twelve
months
though
to
you
the
time
would
seem
no
more
than
a
night
fairy
tribes
in
montgomeryshire
from
who
outlined
for
me
the
montgomeryshire
belief
in
the
as
he
has
known
it
intimately
i
learned
that
this
is
essentially
the
same
as
elsewhere
in
north
and
central
wales
he
summed
up
the
matter
by
saying
in
tylwyth
was
the
opinion
that
the
were
a
real
race
of
invisible
or
spiritual
beings
living
in
an
invisible
world
of
their
own
the
belief
in
the
was
quite
general
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
and
as
sincere
as
any
religious
belief
is
now
our
next
witness
is
the
rev
josiah
jones
minister
of
the
congregational
church
of
machynlleth
and
after
a
lifetime
experience
in
montgomeryshire
he
gives
this
testimony
deacon
deacon
in
my
church
john
evans
declared
that
he
had
seen
the
dancing
in
the
within
two
miles
from
here
and
he
pointed
out
the
very
spot
where
they
appeared
this
was
some
twenty
years
ago
i
think
however
that
he
saw
only
certain
reflections
and
shadows
because
it
was
a
hot
and
brilliant
day
in
i
recall
the
belief
the
old
people
considered
the
as
living
beings
halfway
between
something
material
and
spiritual
who
were
rarely
seen
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
very
much
said
too
about
and
phantom
funerals
and
especially
about
the
plural
of
meaning
a
sprite
ghost
hobgoblin
or
spectre
the
were
supposed
to
appear
at
dusk
in
various
forms
animal
and
human
and
people
as
well
as
children
had
great
fear
of
them
minister
there
is
a
substance
of
truth
in
the
but
it
is
wrongly
accounted
for
in
the
i
once
asked
samuel
roberts
of
llanbrynmair
who
was
quite
a
noted
welsh
scholar
what
he
thought
of
the
of
hobgoblins
spirits
and
so
forth
and
he
said
that
he
believed
such
things
existed
and
that
god
allowed
them
to
appear
in
times
of
great
ignorance
to
convince
people
of
the
existence
of
an
invisible
world
in
cardiganshire
and
a
testimony
no
one
of
our
witnesses
from
central
wales
is
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
living
than
ceredig
davies
of
llanilar
a
village
about
six
miles
from
aberystwyth
for
davies
has
spent
many
years
in
collecting
in
central
and
south
wales
he
has
interviewed
the
oldest
and
most
intelligent
of
the
old
people
and
while
i
write
this
he
has
in
the
press
a
work
entitled
of
mid
and
west
davies
very
kindly
gave
me
the
following
outline
of
the
most
prominent
traits
in
the
welsh
according
to
his
own
investigations
teg
were
considered
a
very
small
people
fond
of
dancing
especially
on
moonlight
nights
they
often
came
to
houses
after
the
family
were
abed
and
if
milk
was
left
for
them
they
would
leave
money
in
return
but
if
not
treated
kindly
they
were
revengeful
the
changeling
idea
was
common
the
mother
coming
home
would
find
an
ugly
changeling
in
the
cradle
sometimes
the
mother
would
consult
the
or
wise
men
as
to
how
to
get
her
babe
back
as
a
rule
treating
the
fairy
babe
roughly
and
then
throwing
it
into
a
river
would
cause
the
fairy
who
made
the
change
to
appear
and
restore
the
real
child
in
return
for
the
changeling
teg
marriage
a
young
man
would
see
the
dancing
and
being
drawn
into
the
dance
would
be
taken
by
them
and
married
to
one
of
their
women
there
is
usually
some
condition
in
the
marriage
contract
which
becomes
broken
and
as
a
result
the
fairy
wife
disappears
usually
into
a
lake
the
marriage
contract
specifies
either
that
the
husband
must
never
touch
his
fairy
wife
with
iron
or
else
never
beat
or
strike
her
three
times
sometimes
when
fairy
wives
thus
disappear
they
take
with
them
into
the
lake
their
fairy
cattle
and
all
their
household
property
teg
were
generally
looked
upon
as
an
immortal
race
in
cardiganshire
they
lived
underground
in
carmarthenshire
in
lakes
and
in
pembrokeshire
along
the
on
enchanted
islands
amid
the
irish
sea
i
have
heard
of
sailors
upon
seeing
such
islands
trying
to
reach
them
but
when
approached
the
islands
always
disappeared
from
a
certain
spot
in
pembrokeshire
it
is
said
that
by
standing
on
a
turf
taken
from
the
yard
of
cathedral
one
may
see
the
enchanted
islands
teg
as
spirits
of
many
of
the
old
people
the
were
classed
with
spirits
they
were
not
looked
upon
as
mortal
at
all
many
of
the
welsh
looked
upon
the
or
fairies
as
the
spirits
of
druids
dead
before
the
time
of
christ
who
being
too
good
to
be
cast
into
hell
were
allowed
to
wander
freely
about
on
earth
testimony
from
a
welshman
years
old
at
pontrhydfendigaid
a
village
about
two
miles
from
the
called
strata
florida
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
john
jones
years
old
yet
of
strong
physique
and
able
to
write
his
name
without
both
davies
registrar
of
the
university
college
of
aberystwyth
and
ceredig
davies
the
eminent
of
llanilar
referred
me
to
john
jones
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
living
welshmen
who
could
tell
about
the
olden
times
from
knowledge
john
jones
speaks
very
little
english
and
john
rees
of
the
council
school
acted
as
our
interpreter
this
is
the
testimony
was
born
and
bred
where
there
was
tradition
that
the
lived
in
holes
in
the
hills
and
that
none
of
these
was
taller
than
three
to
four
feet
it
was
a
common
idea
that
many
of
the
forming
in
a
ring
would
dance
and
sing
out
on
the
or
on
the
plain
and
that
if
children
should
meet
with
them
at
such
a
time
they
would
lose
their
way
and
never
get
out
of
the
ring
if
the
fancied
any
particular
child
they
would
always
keep
that
child
taking
off
its
clothes
and
putting
them
on
one
of
their
own
children
which
was
then
left
in
its
place
they
took
only
boys
never
girls
special
sort
of
used
to
come
out
of
lakes
and
dance
and
their
fine
looks
enticed
young
men
to
follow
them
back
into
the
lakes
and
there
marry
one
of
them
if
the
husband
wished
to
leave
the
lake
he
had
to
go
without
his
fairy
wife
this
sort
of
were
as
big
as
ordinary
people
and
they
were
often
seen
riding
out
of
the
lakes
and
back
again
on
horses
teg
as
spirits
of
prehistoric
grandfather
told
me
that
he
was
once
in
a
certain
field
and
heard
singing
in
the
air
and
thought
it
spirits
singing
soon
afterwards
he
and
his
brother
in
digging
dikes
in
that
field
dug
into
a
big
hole
which
they
entered
and
followed
to
the
end
there
they
found
a
place
full
of
human
bones
and
urns
and
naturally
decided
on
account
of
the
singing
that
the
bones
and
urns
were
of
the
boy
visit
to
the
teg
eighty
years
ago
at
tynylone
my
grandfather
told
me
this
story
a
boy
ten
years
old
was
often
whipped
and
cruelly
treated
by
his
schoolmaster
because
he
could
not
say
his
lessons
very
well
so
one
day
he
ran
away
from
school
and
went
to
a
where
some
little
folk
came
to
him
and
asked
why
he
was
crying
he
told
them
the
master
had
punished
him
and
on
hearing
this
they
said
if
you
will
stay
with
us
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
go
to
school
we
will
keep
you
as
long
as
you
like
then
they
took
him
under
the
water
and
over
the
water
into
a
cave
underground
which
opened
into
a
great
palace
where
the
were
playing
games
with
golden
balls
in
rings
like
those
in
which
they
dance
and
sing
the
boy
had
been
taken
to
the
king
family
and
he
began
to
play
with
the
king
sons
after
he
had
been
there
in
the
palace
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
all
its
pleasures
he
wished
very
much
to
return
to
his
mother
and
show
her
the
golden
ball
which
the
gave
him
and
so
he
took
the
ball
in
his
pocket
and
hurried
through
the
cave
the
way
he
had
come
but
at
the
end
of
it
and
by
the
river
two
of
the
met
him
and
taking
the
ball
away
from
him
they
pushed
him
into
the
water
and
through
the
water
he
found
his
way
home
he
told
his
mother
how
he
had
been
away
for
a
fortnight
as
he
thought
but
she
told
him
it
had
been
for
two
years
though
the
boy
often
tried
to
find
the
way
back
to
the
he
never
could
finally
he
went
back
to
school
and
became
a
most
wonderful
scholar
and
parson
in
merlin
country
and
a
vicar
testimony
the
rev
morgan
vicar
of
newchurch
parish
two
miles
from
carmarthen
has
made
a
very
careful
study
of
the
in
his
own
parish
and
in
other
regions
of
carmarthenshire
and
is
able
to
offer
us
evidence
of
the
highest
value
as
follows
teg
power
over
were
thought
to
be
able
to
take
children
you
mind
or
the
will
take
you
away
parents
would
say
to
keep
their
children
in
the
house
after
dark
it
was
an
opinion
too
that
the
could
transform
good
children
into
kings
and
queens
and
bad
children
into
wicked
spirits
after
such
children
had
been
perhaps
in
death
the
were
believed
to
live
in
some
invisible
world
to
which
children
on
dying
might
go
to
be
rewarded
or
punished
according
to
their
behaviour
on
this
earth
even
in
this
life
the
had
power
over
children
for
good
or
evil
the
belief
as
these
ideas
show
was
that
the
were
spirits
teg
as
evil
a
few
days
after
my
return
to
oxford
the
rev
morgan
through
his
son
mr
basil
morgan
of
jesus
college
placed
in
my
hands
additional
evidence
from
his
own
parish
as
follows
wentz
visited
me
on
thursday
september
i
went
to
see
shem
morgan
the
occupier
of
cwmcastellfach
farm
an
old
man
about
seventy
years
old
he
told
me
that
in
his
childhood
days
a
great
dread
of
the
fairies
occupied
the
heart
of
every
child
they
were
considered
to
be
evil
spirits
who
visited
our
world
at
night
and
dangerous
to
come
in
contact
with
there
were
no
good
spirits
among
them
he
related
to
me
three
narratives
touching
the
fairies
teg
the
first
narrative
illustrates
that
the
have

the
second
narrative
i
quote
farmer
of
this
neighbourhood
having
lost
his
cattle
went
to
consult
dyn
a
diviner
in
cardiganshire
who
was
friendly
with
the
fairies
whenever
the
fairies
visited
the
diviner
they
foretold
future
events
secrets
and
the
whereabouts
of
lost
property
after
the
farmer
reached
the
diviner
house
the
diviner
showed
him
the
fairies
and
then
when
the
diviner
had
consulted
them
he
told
the
farmer
to
go
home
as
soon
as
he
could
and
that
he
would
find
the
cattle
in
such
and
such
a
place
the
farmer
did
as
he
was
directed
and
found
the
cattle
in
the
very
place
where
the
told
him
they
would
be
and
the
third
narrative
asserts
that
a
man
in
the
parish
of
trelech
who
was
fraudulently
excluded
by
means
of
a
false
will
from
inheriting
the
estate
of
his
deceased
father
discovered
the
defrauder
and
recovered
the
estate
solely
through
having
followed
the
advice
given
by
the
when
again
as
in
the
above
account
they
were
called
up
as
spirits

testimony
from
a
justice
of
the
peace
david
williams
who
is
a
member
of
the
cymmrodorion
society
of
carmarthen
and
who
has
sat
on
the
judicial
bench
for
ten
years
offers
us
the
very
valuable
evidence
which
follows
teg
and
their
king
and
general
idea
as
i
remember
it
was
that
the
were
only
visitors
to
this
world
and
had
no
terrestrial
habitations
they
were
as
small
in
stature
as
dwarfs
and
always
appeared
in
white
often
at
night
they
danced
in
rings
amid
green
fields
most
of
them
were
females
though
they
had
a
king
and
as
their
name
suggests
they
were
very
beautiful
in
appearance
the
king
of
the
was
called
ab
referring
to
a
temperament
in
man
nature
his
residence
was
among
the
stars
and
called
his
queen
was
i
have
heard
my
mother
call
the
small
clouds
which
appear
in
fine
weather
the
of
teg
as
aerial
williams
testimony
continues
and
leads
us
directly
to
the
psychological
or
psychical
theory
aerial
beings
the
could
fly
and
move
about
in
the
air
at
will
they
were
a
special
order
of
creation
i
never
heard
that
they
grew
old
and
whether
they
multiplied
or
not
i
can
not
tell
in
character
they
were
almost
always
good
and
our
conversation
finally
drifted
towards
ghosts
and
apparitions
as
usual
and
to
druids
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
pp
we
shall
record
what
williams
said
about
druids
and
here
what
he
said
about
ghosts
and
apparitions
years
ago
there
was
hardly
an
individual
who
did
not
believe
in
apparitions
and
in
olden
times
welsh
families
would
collect
round
the
fire
at
night
and
each
in
turn
give
a
story
about
the
and
ghosts
vision
of
a
phantom
used
to
be
an
old
man
at
newchurch
named
david
davis
who
lived
about
of
abernant
noted
for
seeing
phantom
funerals
one
appeared
to
him
once
when
he
was
with
a
friend
do
you
see
it
do
you
see
it
the
old
man
excitedly
asked
no
said
his
friend
then
the
old
man
placed
his
foot
on
his
friend
foot
and
said
do
you
see
it
now
and
the
friend
replied
that
he
did
and
finally
we
shall
hear
from
williams
about
welsh
magic
and
witchcraft
which
can
not
scientifically
be
divorced
from
the
belief
in
fairies
and
apparitions
used
to
be
much
witchcraft
in
this
country
and
it
was
fully
believed
that
some
men
if
advanced
scholars
had
the
power
to
injure
or
to
bewitch
their
neighbours
by
magic
the
more
advanced
the
scholar
the
better
he
could
carry
on
his
craft
additional
evidence
from
carmarthenshire
my
friend
and
fellow
student
at
jesus
college
percival
davies
of
carmarthen
contributes
as
supplementary
to
what
has
been
recorded
above
the
following
evidence
from
his
spurrell
also
of
carmarthen
a
native
welshwoman
who
has
seen
a
y
the
carmarthenshire
country
fairies
are
often
called
y
the
mothers
blessing
ten
children
became
lord
in
the
days
when
he
walked
the
earth
chanced
one
day
to
approach
a
cottage
in
which
lived
a
woman
with
twenty
children
feeling
ashamed
of
the
size
of
her
family
she
hid
half
of
them
from
the
sight
of
her
divine
visitor
on
his
departure
she
sought
for
the
hidden
children
in
vain
they
had
become
fairies
and
had
disappeared
in
pembrokeshire
at
the
pentre
evan
cromlech
our
pembrokeshire
witness
is
a
maiden
welshwoman
sixty
years
old
who
speaks
no
english
but
a
university
graduate
her
nephew
will
act
as
our
interpreter
she
was
born
and
has
lived
all
her
life
within
sight
of
the
famous
pentre
evan
cromlech
in
the
home
of
her
ancestors
which
is
so
ancient
that
after
six
centuries
of
its
known
existence
further
record
of
it
is
lost
in
spite
of
her
sixty
years
our
witness
is
as
active
as
many
a
city
woman
of
forty
or
since
her
girlhood
she
has
heard
curious
legends
and
stories
and
with
a
more
than
ordinary
interest
in
the
lore
of
her
native
country
has
treasured
them
all
in
her
clear
and
memory
the
first
night
while
this
memory
of
hers
gave
forth
some
of
its
treasures
we
sat
in
her
own
home
i
and
my
friend
her
nephew
on
one
side
in
a
and
she
and
her
niece
on
the
other
side
in
another
exposed
to
the
cheerful
glow
and
warmth
of
the
fire
when
we
had
finished
that
first
night
it
was
two
and
there
had
been
no
interruption
to
the
even
flow
of
marvels
and
pretty
legends
a
second
night
we
spent
likewise
what
follows
now
is
the
result
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
with
it
and
and
fairies
exist
all
round
us
invisible
fairies
have
no
solid
bodily
substance
their
forms
are
of
matter
like
ghostly
bodies
and
on
this
account
they
can
not
be
caught
in
the
twilight
they
are
often
seen
and
on
moonlight
nights
in
summer
only
certain
people
can
see
fairies
and
such
people
hold
communication
with
them
and
have
dealings
with
them
but
it
is
difficult
to
get
them
to
talk
about
fairies
i
think
the
spirits
about
us
are
the
fallen
angels
for
when
old
doctor
harris
died
his
books
on
witchcraft
had
to
be
burned
in
order
to
free
the
place
where
he
lived
from
evil
spirits
the
fairies
too
are
sometimes
called
the
fallen
angels
they
will
do
good
to
those
who
befriend
them
and
harm
to
others
i
think
there
must
be
an
intermediate
state
between
life
on
earth
and
heavenly
life
and
it
may
be
in
this
that
spirits
and
fairies
live
there
are
two
distinct
types
of
spirits
one
is
good
and
the
other
is
bad
i
have
heard
of
people
going
to
the
fairies
and
finding
that
years
passed
as
days
but
i
do
not
believe
in
changelings
though
there
are
stories
enough
about
them
that
there
are
fairies
and
other
spirits
like
them
both
good
and
bad
i
firmly
believe
my
mother
used
to
tell
about
seeing
the
dancing
in
the
fields
near
cardigan
and
other
people
have
seen
them
round
the
cromlech
up
there
on
the
hill
the
pentre
evan
cromlech
they
appeared
as
little
children
in
clothes
like
clothes
and
with
red
caps
according
to
some
accounts
have
seen
more
than
one
i
saw
one
right
here
in
this
room
where
we
are
sitting
and
talking
i
was
told
by
the
nephew
and
niece
of
our
present
witness
that
this
particular
took
an
untrodden
course
from
the
house
across
the
fields
to
the
and
that
when
the
death
of
one
of
the
family
occurred
soon
afterwards
their
aunt
insisted
that
the
corpse
should
be
carried
by
exactly
the
same
route
so
the
road
was
abandoned
and
the
funeral
went
through
the
ploughed
fields
here
is
the
description
of
the
as
the
aunt
gave
it
in
response
to
our
request
appears
like
a
patch
of
bright
light
and
no
matter
how
dark
the
room
or
place
is
everything
in
it
is
as
clear
as
day
the
candle
is
not
a
flame
but
a
luminous
mass
lightish
blue
in
colour
which
dances
as
though
borne
by
an
invisible
agency
and
sometimes
it
rolls
over
and
over
if
you
go
up
to
the
light
it
is
nothing
for
it
is
a
spirit
near
here
a
light
as
big
as
a
pot
was
seen
and
rays
shot
out
from
it
in
all
directions
the
man
you
saw
here
in
the
house
one
night
as
he
was
going
along
the
road
near
nevern
saw
the
of
old
harris
and
says
it
was
lightish
green
goch
now
we
began
to
hear
more
about
fairies
night
there
came
a
strange
rapping
at
the
door
of
the
ancient
manor
on
the
gors
goch
farm
over
in
cardiganshire
and
the
father
of
the
family
asked
what
was
wanted
thin
silvery
voices
said
they
wanted
a
warm
place
in
which
to
dress
their
children
and
to
tidy
them
up
the
door
opened
then
and
in
came
a
dozen
or
more
little
beings
who
at
once
set
themselves
to
hunting
for
a
basin
and
water
and
to
cleaning
themselves
at
daybreak
they
departed
leaving
a
pretty
gift
in
return
for
the
kindness
in
this
same
house
at
another
time
whether
by
the
same
party
of
little
beings
or
by
another
could
not
be
told
a
healthy
child
of
the
family
was
because
he
was
unbaptized
and
a
child
left
in
his
place
the
mother
finally
died
of
grief
and
the
other
children
died
because
of
the
loss
of
their
mother
and
the
father
was
left
alone
then
some
time
after
this
the
same
little
folks
who
came
the
first
time
returned
to
clean
up
and
when
they
departed
in
place
of
their
former
gifts
of
silver
left
a
gift
of
gold
it
was
not
long
before
the
father
became
heir
to
a
rich
farm
in
north
wales
and
going
to
live
on
it
became
a
magician
for
the
little
people
still
befriending
him
revealed
themselves
in
their
true
nature
and
taught
him
all
their
secrets
salmon
control
of
salmon
who
lived
about
thirty
years
ago
between
here
and
newport
was
a
magician
and
could
call
up
good
and
bad
spirits
but
was
afraid
to
call
up
the
bad
ones
unless
another
person
was
with
him
for
it
was
a
dangerous
and
terrible
ordeal
after
consulting
certain
books
which
he
had
he
would
draw
a
circle
on
the
floor
and
in
a
little
while
spirits
like
bulls
and
serpents
and
other
animals
would
appear
in
it
and
all
sorts
of
spirits
would
speak
it
was
not
safe
to
go
near
them
and
to
control
them
levi
held
a
whip
in
his
hand
he
would
never
let
them
cross
the
circle
and
when
he
wanted
them
to
go
away
he
always
had
to
throw
something
to
the
chief
spirit
haunted
manor
and
the
golden
i
offer
now
in
my
own
language
the
following
remarkable
story
the
ancient
on
the
trewern
farm
less
than
a
mile
from
the
pentre
evan
cromlech
had
been
haunted
as
long
as
anybody
could
remember
strange
noises
were
often
heard
in
it
dishes
would
dance
about
of
their
own
accord
and
sometimes
a
lady
dressed
in
silk
appeared
many
attempts
were
made
to
lay
the
ghosts
but
none
succeeded
finally
things
got
so
bad
that
nobody
wanted
to
live
there
about
eighty
years
ago
the
sole
occupants
of
the
haunted
house
were
and
his
two
servants
at
the
time
it
was
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
that
all
at
once
became
very
wealthy
and
his
servants
seemed
able
to
buy
whatever
they
wanted
everybody
wondered
but
no
one
could
tell
where
the
money
came
from
for
at
first
he
was
a
poor
man
and
he
could
have
made
much
off
the
farm
the
secret
only
leaked
out
through
one
of
the
servants
after
was
dead
the
servant
declared
to
certain
friends
that
one
of
the
ghosts
or
as
he
thought
the
devil
appeared
to
and
told
him
there
was
an
image
of
great
value
walled
up
in
the
room
over
the
main
entrance
to
the
manor
a
search
was
made
and
sure
enough
a
large
image
of
solid
gold
was
found
in
the
very
place
indicated
built
into
a
recess
in
the
wall
bound
the
servants
to
secrecy
and
began
to
turn
the
image
into
money
he
would
cut
off
small
pieces
of
the
image
one
at
a
time
and
take
them
to
london
and
sell
them
in
this
way
he
sold
the
whole
image
and
nobody
was
the
wiser
after
the
image
was
found
and
disposed
of
ghosts
were
no
longer
seen
in
the
house
nor
were
unusual
noises
heard
in
it
at
night
the
one
thing
which
beyond
all
doubt
is
true
is
that
when
died
he
left
his
son
an
estate
worth
about
an
amount
probably
greatly
in
excess
of
the
true
one
and
people
have
always
wondered
ever
since
where
it
came
from
if
not
in
part
from
the
golden
image
hundreds
of
parallel
stories
in
which
instead
of
ghosts
fairies
and
demons
are
said
to
have
revealed
hidden
treasure
could
be
cited
in
the
gower
peninsula
glamorganshire
our
investigations
in
glamorganshire
cover
the
most
interesting
part
the
peninsula
of
gower
where
there
are
peculiar
conditions
due
to
its
present
population
being
by
ancestry
english
and
flemish
as
well
as
cornish
and
welsh
despite
this
race
admixture
brythonic
beliefs
have
generally
survived
in
gower
even
among
the
and
because
of
the
cornish
element
there
are
pixies
as
shown
by
the
following
story
related
to
me
in
swansea
by
a
mining
engineer
newton
near
the
mumbles
in
gower
an
old
woman
some
twenty
years
ago
assured
me
that
she
had
seen
the
pixies
her
grey
mare
was
standing
in
the
trap
before
the
house
ready
to
take
some
produce
to
the
swansea
market
and
when
the
time
for
departure
arrived
the
pixies
had
come
but
no
one
save
the
old
woman
could
see
them
she
described
them
to
me
as
like
tiny
men
dancing
on
the
mare
back
and
climbing
up
along
the
mare
mane
she
thought
the
pixies
some
kind
of
spirits
who
made
their
appearance
in
early
morning
and
all
mishaps
to
cows
she
attributed
to
them
testimony
from
an
archaeologist
the
rev
john
david
davis
rector
of
llanmadoc
and
cheriton
parishes
and
a
member
of
the
cambrian
archaeological
society
has
passed
many
years
in
studying
the
antiquities
and
of
gower
being
the
author
of
various
antiquarian
works
and
he
is
without
doubt
the
oldest
and
best
living
authority
to
aid
us
the
rector
very
willingly
offers
this
testimony
and
this
part
of
gower
the
name
is
never
used
to
describe
fairies
is
used
instead
some
sixty
years
ago
as
i
can
remember
there
was
belief
in
such
fairies
here
in
gower
but
now
there
is
almost
none
belief
in
apparitions
still
exists
to
some
extent
one
may
also
hear
of
a
person
being
the
pixies
may
cause
a
traveller
to
lose
his
way
at
night
if
he
crosses
a
field
where
they
happen
to
be
to
take
your
coat
off
and
turn
it
inside
out
will
break
the
pixy
spell
the
were
always
little
people
dressed
in
scarlet
and
green
and
they
generally
showed
themselves
dancing
on
moonlight
nights
i
never
heard
of
their
making
changelings
though
they
had
the
power
of
doing
good
or
evil
acts
and
it
was
a
very
risky
thing
to
offend
them
by
nature
they
were
benevolent
volk
heard
the
following
story
many
years
ago
the
tenant
on
the
eynonsford
farm
here
in
gower
had
a
dream
one
night
and
in
it
thought
he
heard
soft
sweet
music
and
the
patter
of
dancing
feet
waking
up
he
beheld
his
which
opened
off
his
bedroom
filled
with
a
multitude
of
little
beings
about
one
foot
high
swarming
all
over
his
fat
ox
and
they
were
preparing
to
slaughter
the
ox
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
could
not
move
in
a
short
time
the
had
killed
dressed
and
eaten
the
animal
the
feast
being
over
they
collected
the
hide
and
bones
except
one
very
small
which
they
could
not
find
placed
them
in
position
then
stretched
the
hide
over
them
and
as
the
farmer
looked
the
ox
appeared
as
sound
and
fat
as
ever
but
when
he
let
it
out
to
pasture
in
the
morning
he
observed
that
it
had
a
slight
lameness
in
the
leg
lacking
the
missing
bone
fairies
among
gower
english
folk
the
population
of
the
llanmadoc
region
of
gower
are
generally
english
by
ancestry
and
speech
and
not
until
reaching
llanmorlais
beyond
llanridian
did
i
find
anything
like
an
original
celtic
and
people
and
these
may
have
come
into
that
part
within
comparatively
recent
times
and
yet
as
the
above
tend
to
prove
in
early
days
all
these
regions
must
have
been
welsh
it
may
be
argued
however
that
this
population
may
be
more
celtic
than
saxon
even
though
emigrants
from
england
in
any
case
we
can
see
with
interest
how
this
english
population
now
echo
brythonic
beliefs
which
they
appear
to
have
adopted
in
gower
possibly
sympathetically
through
race
kinship
and
the
following
testimony
offered
by
miss
sarah
jenkins
postmistress
of
llanmadoc
will
enable
us
to
do
so
with
man
whose
christian
name
was
william
was
enticed
by
the
fairy
folk
to
enter
their
dance
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
swansea
market
in
the
early
morning
they
kept
him
dancing
some
time
and
then
said
to
him
before
they
let
him
go
will
dance
well
the
last
going
to
market
and
the
first
that
shall
sell
and
though
he
arrived
at
the
market
very
late
he
was
the
first
to
sell
anything
old
woman
whom
i
knew
used
to
find
money
left
by
the
fairies
every
time
they
visited
her
house
for
a
long
time
she
observed
their
request
and
told
no
one
about
the
money
but
at
last
she
told
and
so
never
found
money
afterwards
of
fairies
were
believed
to
have
plenty
of
music
and
dancing
sometimes
they
appeared
dressed
in
bright
red
they
could
appear
and
disappear
suddenly
and
no
one
could
tell
how
or
where
conclusion
much
more
might
easily
be
said
about
welsh
goblins
about
welsh
fairies
who
live
in
caves
or
about
welsh
fairy
women
who
come
out
of
lakes
and
rivers
or
who
are
the
presiding
spirits
of
sacred
wells
and
fountains
but
these
will
have
some
consideration
later
in
section
iii
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
inquiry
enough
evidence
has
been
offered
to
show
the
fundamental
character
of
brythonic
as
we
have
found
them
and
we
can
very
appropriately
close
this
inquiry
by
allowing
our
witness
from
the
pentre
evan
country
pembrokeshire
to
tell
us
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
interesting
in
all
wales
the
name
of
taliessin
appearing
in
it
leads
us
to
suspect
that
it
may
be
the
remnant
of
an
ancient
bardic
tale
which
has
been
handed
down
orally
for
centuries
it
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
marked
difference
between
the
short
conversational
stories
of
the
living
and
the
longer
more
polished
ones
of
the
traditional
and
we
shall
see
in
it
how
a
literary
effect
is
gained
at
the
expense
of
the
real
character
of
the
fairies
themselves
for
it
transforms
them
into
mortals
and
mother
told
the
story
as
she
used
to
sit
by
the
fire
in
the
twilight
knitting
stockings
one
day
when
it
was
cloudy
and
misty
a
shepherd
boy
going
to
the
mountains
lost
his
way
and
walked
about
for
hours
at
last
he
came
to
a
hollow
place
surrounded
by
rushes
where
he
saw
a
number
of
round
rings
he
recognized
the
place
as
one
he
had
often
heard
of
as
dangerous
for
shepherds
because
of
the
rings
he
tried
to
get
away
from
there
but
he
could
not
then
an
old
merry
man
appeared
the
boy
thinking
to
find
his
way
home
followed
the
old
man
and
the
old
man
said
to
him
not
speak
a
word
till
i
tell
you
in
a
little
while
they
came
to
a
long
stone
the
old
man
tapped
it
three
times
and
then
lifted
it
up
a
narrow
path
with
steps
descending
was
revealed
and
from
it
emerged
a
light
me
said
the
old
man
harm
will
come
to
you
the
boy
did
so
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
a
fine
wooded
fertile
country
with
a
beautiful
palace
and
rivers
and
mountains
he
reached
the
palace
and
was
enchanted
by
the
singing
of
birds
music
of
all
sorts
was
in
the
palace
but
he
saw
no
people
at
meals
dishes
came
and
disappeared
of
their
own
accord
he
could
hear
voices
all
about
him
but
saw
no
person
except
the
old
man
who
said
that
now
he
could
speak
when
he
tried
to
speak
he
found
that
he
could
not
move
his
tongue
soon
an
old
lady
with
smiles
came
to
him
leading
three
beautiful
maidens
and
when
the
maidens
saw
the
shepherd
boy
they
smiled
and
spoke
but
he
could
not
reply
then
one
of
the
girls
kissed
him
and
all
at
once
he
began
to
converse
freely
and
most
wittily
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
marvellous
country
he
lived
with
the
maidens
in
the
palace
a
day
and
a
year
not
thinking
it
more
than
a
day
for
there
was
no
reckoning
of
time
in
that
land
when
the
day
and
the
year
were
up
a
longing
to
see
his
old
acquaintances
came
on
him
and
thanking
the
old
man
for
his
kindness
he
asked
if
he
could
return
home
the
old
man
said
to
him
a
little
while
and
so
he
waited
the
maiden
who
had
kissed
him
was
unwilling
to
have
him
go
but
when
he
promised
her
to
return
she
sent
him
off
loaded
with
riches
at
home
not
one
of
his
people
or
old
friends
knew
him
everybody
believed
that
he
had
been
killed
by
another
shepherd
and
this
shepherd
had
been
accused
of
the
murder
and
had
fled
to
america
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
moon
the
boy
remembered
his
promise
and
returned
to
the
other
country
and
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
beautiful
palace
when
he
arrived
einion
for
that
was
the
boy
name
and
olwen
for
that
was
the
girl
name
now
wanted
to
marry
but
they
had
to
go
about
it
quietly
and
half
secretly
for
the
dislike
ceremony
and
noise
when
the
marriage
was
over
einion
wished
to
go
back
with
olwen
to
the
upper
world
so
two
ponies
were
given
them
and
they
were
allowed
to
depart
they
reached
the
upper
world
safely
and
being
possessed
of
unlimited
wealth
lived
most
handsomely
on
a
great
estate
which
came
into
their
possession
a
son
was
born
to
them
and
he
was
called
taliessin
people
soon
began
to
ask
for
olwen
pedigree
and
as
none
was
given
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
she
was
one
of
the
indeed
said
einion
is
no
doubt
that
she
is
one
of
the
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
is
one
of
the
very
for
she
has
two
sisters
as
pretty
as
she
is
and
if
you
saw
them
all
together
you
would
admit
that
the
name
is
a
suitable
one
and
this
is
the
origin
of
the
term
from
wales
we
go
to
the
nearest
brythonic
country
cornwall
to
study
the
there

in
cornwall
introduction
by
henry
jenner
member
of
the
gorsedd
of
the
bards
of
brittany
fellow
and
local
secretary
for
cornwall
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
author
of

of
the
cornish
in
cornwall
the
legends
of
giants
of
saints
or
of
arthur
and
his
knights
the
observances
and
superstitions
connected
with
the
prehistoric
stone

mines
and
the
like
the
stories
of
submerged
or
buried
cities
and
the
fragments
of
what
would
seem
to
be
faiths
have
no
doubt
occasional
points
of
contact
with
cornish
fairy
legends
but
they
do
not
help
to
explain
the
fairies
very
much
yet
certain
it
is
that
not
only
in
cornwall
and
other
celtic
lands
but
throughout
most
of
the
world
a
belief
in
fairies
exists
or
has
existed
and
so
widespread
a
belief
must
have
a
reason
for
it
though
not
necessarily
a
good
one
that
which
with
unconscious
humour
men
generally
call
has
in
these
days
caused
those
lower
classes
to
whom
the
deposit
of
this
faith
was
entrusted
to
be
ashamed
of
it
and
to
despise
and
endeavour
to
forget
it
and
so
now
in
cornwall
as
elsewhere
at
that
earlier
outbreak
of
philistinism
the
reformation
from
haunted
spring
and
grassy
ring
troop
goblin
elf
and
fairy
and
the
kelpie
must
flit
from
the
black
and
the
brownie
must
not
tarry
but
in
spite
of
protestantism
and
education
committees
are
still
placed
on
the
of
west
cornish
cottages
to
propitiate
the
piskies
and
give
them
a
lest
they
should
turn
the
milk
sour
and
just
and
morvah
folk
are
still
on
the
gump
ûn
the
level
down
between
chûn
castle
and
carn
kenidjack
and
more
rarely
columb
and
roche
folk
on
goss
moor
it
will
not
do
to
say
that
it
is
only
another
form
of
that
is
an
evidently
modern
explanation
invented
since
the
substitution
of
strange
scottish
and
irish
drinks
for
the
good
and
wholesome
of
old
time
and
it
does
not
fit
in
with
the
phenomena
it
was
only
last
winter
in
a
cottage
not
a
hundred
yards
from
where
i
am
writing
that
milk
was
set
at
night
for
piskies
who
had
been
knocking
on
walls
and
generally
making
nuisances
of
themselves
apparently
the
piskies
only
drank
the
part
of
the
milk
whatever
that
may
be
and
then
the
neighbouring
cats
drank
what
was
left
and
it
disagreed
with
them
i
can
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
the
part
about
the
piskies
and
the
milk
i
give
it
as
it
was
told
to
me
by
the
occupant
of
the
cottage
who
was
not
unacquainted
with
terminology
but
i
do
know
that
the
milk
was
consumed
and
that
the
cats
one
of
which
was
my
own
were
with
one
accord
unwell
all
over
the
place
but
for
the
present
purpose
it
does
not
matter
whether
these
things
really
happened
or
not
the
point
is
that
people
thought
they
happened
robert
hunt
in
his
romances
of
the
west
of
divided
the
fairies
of
cornish
into
five
classes
the
small
people
the
spriggans
the
piskies
the
buccas
bockles
or
knockers
the
brownies
this
is
an
incorrect
classification
the
or
small
people
the
spriggans
and
the
piskies
are
not
really
distinguishable
from
one
another
bucca
who
properly
is
but
one
is
a
deity
not
a
fairy
and
it
is
said
that
at
newlyn
the
great
seat
of
his
worship
offerings
of
fish
are
still
left
on
the
beach
for
him
his
name
is
the
welsh
which
is
probably
though
puck
was
just
a
pisky
and
it
may
be
connected
with
the
general
slavonic
word
god
so
that
if
as
some
say
is
really
meant
for
black
bucca
this
may
be
an
equivalent
of
the
black
god
who
was
the
ahriman
of
slavonic
dualism
and
white
bucca
which
is
rarer
though
the
expression
does
come
into
a
levan
story
may
be
the
corresponding
which
personally
i
have
never
heard
used
suggests
the
scottish
and
both
may
be
diminutives
of
or
the
last
in
the
sense
in
which
one
english
version
translates
the
of
psalm
xc
not
in
that
of
but
and
are
probably
both
foreign
importations
borrowed
from
books
though
a
has
been
reported
from
sennen
within
the
last
twenty
years
the
knockers
or
knackers
are
quite
unconnected
with
bucca
or
bogles
the
story
as
i
have
always
heard
it
is
that
they
are
the
spirits
of
jews
who
were
sent
by
the
romans
to
work
in
the
tin
mines
some
say
for
being
concerned
in
the
crucifixion
of
our
lord
which
sounds
improbable
they
are
benevolent
spirits
and
warn
miners
of
danger
but
the
only
true
cornish
fairy
is
the
pisky
of
the
race
which
is
the
or
little
people
and
the
spriggan
is
only
one
of
his
aspects
the
pisky
would
seem
to
be
the
of
the
lowland
scot
the
of
the
highlander
and
if
we
may
judge
from
an
interesting
note
in
scott
the
of
the
orkneys
if
really
means
folk
of
the
mounds
barrows
not
people
of
peace
it
is
possible
that
there
is
something
in
the
theory
that
brownie
and
which
is
pict
are
only
in
their
origin
ways
of
expressing
the
little
aboriginal
folk
who
were
supposed
to
inhabit
the
barrows
cromlechs
and
and
whose
cunning
their
only
effective
weapon
against
the
mere
strength
of
the
aryan
invader
earned
them
a
reputation
for
magical
powers
now
or
is
really
though
as
a
patriotic
cornishman
i
ought
not
to
admit
it
i
can
not
deny
especially
as
it
suits
my
argument
better
that
the
devon
form
is
the
correct
one
but
after
all
there
has
been
always
a
strong
cornish
element
in
devon
even
since
the
time
when
athelstan
drove
the
britons
out
of
exeter
and
set
the
tamar
for
their
boundary
and
i
think
the
original
word
is
really
cornish
the
transposition
of
consonants
especially
when
is
one
of
them
is
not
uncommon
in
modern
cornish
english
for
and
for
are
instances
if
we
take
the
root
of
and
divide
the
double
letter
into
its
component
parts
we
get
or
and
if
we
remember
that
a
final
or
in
cornish
almost
always
represents
a
or
of
welsh
and
breton
cf
for
for
for
we
may
not
unreasonably
though
without
absolute
certainty
conjecture
that
is
in
a
cornish
form
without
begging
any
question
concerning
the
origin
ethnology
or
homogeneity
of
those
who
are
called
in
history
from
the
times
of
ammianus
marcellinus
and
claudian
until
kenneth
macalpine
united
the
pictish
kingdom
with
the
scottish
we
can
nevertheless
accept
the
fact
that
the
name
has
been
popularly
applied
to
some
race
or
races
to
whom
certain
ancient
structures
such
as
and
houses
have
been
attributed
in
cornwall
there
are
instances
of
prehistoric
structures
being
called
halls
there
is
an
so
called
at
bosahan
in
constantine
and
crows
or
breton
is
a
shed
or
hovel
craw
is
still
used
for
and
there
are
three
genuine
examples
of
what
would
in
scotland
be
called
houses
just
outside
ives
in
the
direction
of
zennor
though
only
modern
antiquaries
have
applied
that
name
to
them
in
the
district
in
which
they
are
the
fringe
of
coast
from
ives
round
by
zennor
morvah
pendeen
and
just
nearly
to
sennen
are
found
to
this
day
a
strange
and
separate
people
of
mongol
type
like
the
bigaudens
of
pont
and
in
the
breton
cornouailles
one
of
those
of
forgotten
peoples
of
the
bound
of
lyonesse
of
whom
tennyson
tells
they
are
a
little
dark
folk
and
until
comparatively
modern
times
were
recognized
as
different
from
their
celtic
neighbours
and
were
commonly
believed
to
be
largely
wizards
and
witches
one
of
wentz
informants
seems
to
attribute
to
zennor
a
particularly
virulent
brand
of
pisky
and
zennor
is
the
most
primitive
part
of
that
district
possibly
the
more
completely
unmixed
ancestors
of
this
race
were
so
than
the
present
representatives
but
be
this
as
it
may
if
is
really
it
would
seem
that
like
the
inhabitants
of
the
extreme
north
of
the
british
isles
the
britons
eventually
applied
the
fairly
general
popular
name
of
the
mysterious
half
dreaded
half
despised
aboriginal
to
a
race
of
preternatural
beings
in
whose
existence
they
believed
and
with
the
name
transferred
some
of
the
qualities
attributes
and
legends
thus
producing
a
mixed
mental
conception
now
known
as
or
there
seems
to
have
been
always
and
everywhere
or
nearly
so
a
belief
in
a
race
neither
divine
nor
human
but
very
like
to
human
beings
who
existed
on
a
different
from
that
of
humans
though
occupying
the
same
space
this
has
been
called
the
or
the
plane
why
why
why
are
questions
the
answers
to
which
do
not
matter
and
i
do
not
attempt
to
defend
the
terms
but
you
must
call
it
something
this
is
the
belief
to
which
scott
refers
in
the
introduction
to
as
the
but
almost
forgotten
theory
of
astral
spirits
or
creatures
of
the
elements
surpassing
human
beings
in
knowledge
and
power
but
inferior
to
them
as
being
subject
after
a
certain
space
of
years
to
a
death
which
is
to
them
annihilation
the
subdivisions
and
elaborations
of
the
subject
by
paracelsus
the
rosicrucians
and
the
modern
theosophists
are
no
doubt
amplifications
of
that
popular
belief
which
though
rather
undefined
resembles
the
theory
of
these
mystics
in
its
main
outlines
and
was
probably
what
suggested
it
to
them
these
beings
are
held
to
be
normally
imperceptible
to
human
senses
but
conditions
may
arise
in
which
the
plane
of
the
elementals
and
that
part
of
the
plane
in
which
if
one
may
so
express
it
some
human
being
happens
to
be
may
be
in
such
a
relation
to
one
another
that
these
and
other
spirits
may
be
seen
and
heard
some
such
condition
is
perhaps
described
in
the
story
of
balaam
the
soothsayer
in
that
incident
when
lord
opened
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
and
he
saw
and
behold
the
mountain
was
full
of
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
round
about
elisha
and
possibly
also
in
the
mysterious
of
a
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees
which
david
heard
but
no
doubt
in
these
cases
it
was
angels
and
not
elementals
it
may
also
be
allowable
to
suggest
without
irreverence
that
the
gospel
stories
of
the
transfiguration
and
ascension
are
connected
with
the
same
idea
though
the
latter
is
expressed
in
the
form
of
the
geocentric
theory
of
the
universe
the
cornish
pisky
stories
are
largely
made
up
of
instances
of
contact
between
the
two
sometimes
accidental
sometimes
deliberately
induced
by
incantations
or
magic
yet
with
these
stories
are
often
mingled
incidents
that
are
not
preternatural
at
all
how
when
and
why
this
belief
arose
i
do
not
pretend
even
to
conjecture
but
there
it
is
and
though
of
course
the
holders
of
it
do
not
talk
about
that
is
very
much
the
notion
which
they
appear
to
have
i
do
not
think
that
the
piskies
were
ever
definitely
held
to
be
the
spirits
of
the
dead
and
while
a
certain
confusion
has
arisen
as
some
of
wentz
informants
show
i
think
it
belongs
to
the
confused
eschatology
of
modern
protestants
to
a
cornishman
or
indeed
to
any
other
catholic
the
idea
was
unthinkable
animae
in
manu
dei
sunt
et
non
tanget
illos
tormentum
malitiae
visi
sunt
oculis
insipientium
mori
illi
autem
sunt
in
pace
and
the
transmigration
of
the
souls
of
the
faithful
departed
into
another
order
of
beings
not
disembodied
because
never
embodied
was
to
them
impossible
such
a
notion
is
on
a
par
with
the
quaint
but
very
usual
hope
of
the
modern
christian
so
beautifully
expressed
in
one
of
hans
andersen
stories
that
his
departed
friends
are
promoted
to
be
there
may
be
perhaps
an
idea
as
there
certainly
is
in
the
breton
that
the
spirits
of
the
faithful
dead
are
all
round
us
and
are
not
rapt
away
into
a
paradise
or
purgatory
this
may
be
of
origin
but
does
not
contradict
any
article
of
the
christian
faith
the
warnings
apparitions
and
hauntings
the
of
the
dead
at
sea
and
other
details
of
cornish
seem
to
point
to
a
conception
of
a
of
the
dead
similar
to
but
not
necessarily
identical
with
that
of
the
elementals
under
some
quite
undefined
conditions
contact
may
occur
with
the
plane
whence
the
alleged
incidents
but
this
cornish
though
sometimes
as
commonly
in
brittany
presenting
similar
phenomena
has
in
itself
nothing
to
do
with
piskies
and
as
for
the
unfaithful
departed
their
destination
was
also
well
understood
and
it
was
not
fairyland
there
are
possible
connecting
links
in
the
not
very
common
idea
that
piskies
are
the
souls
of
unbaptized
children
and
in
the
more
common
notion
that
the
are
not
the
disembodied
spirits
but
the
living
souls
and
bodies
of
the
old
pagans
who
refusing
christianity
are
miraculously
preserved
alive
but
are
condemned
to
decrease
in
size
until
they
vanish
altogether
some
authorities
hold
that
it
is
the
race
and
not
the
individual
which
dwindles
from
generation
to
generation
this
last
idea
as
well
as
the
name
gives
some
probability
to
the
conclusion
that
as
applied
to
cornwall
macritchie
theory
represents
a
part
of
the
truth
and
that
on
to
an
already
existing
belief
in
elementals
have
been
grafted
exaggerated
traditions
of
a
dark
people
these
were
not
necessarily
pygmies
but
smaller
than
celts
and
may
have
survived
for
a
long
time
in
forests
and
hill
countries
sometimes
friendly
to
the
taller
race
whence
come
the
stories
of
piskies
working
for
farmers
sometimes
hostile
which
may
account
for
the
legends
of
changelings
and
other
mischievous
tricks
this
is
how
it
appears
to
one
who
knows
his
cornwall
in
all
its
aspects
fairly
well
but
does
not
profess
to
be
an
expert
in
bospowes
hayle
cornwall
our
investigation
of
the
in
cornwall
covers
the
region
between
falmouth
and
the
land
end
which
is
now
the
most
celtic
and
the
tintagel
country
on
the
north
coast
it
is
generally
believed
that
ancient
cornish
legends
like
the
cornish
language
are
things
of
the
past
only
but
i
am
now
no
longer
of
that
opinion
undoubtedly
cornwall
is
the
most
anglicized
of
all
celtic
lands
we
are
studying
and
its
is
therefore
far
from
being
as
virile
as
the
irish
nevertheless
through
its
people
racially
mixed
though
they
are
there
still
flows
the
blood
and
the
inspiration
of
a
prehistoric
native
ancestry
and
among
the
oldest
cornish
men
and
women
of
many
an
isolated
village
or
farm
there
yet
remains
some
belief
in
fairies
and
pixies
moreover
throughout
all
of
old
cornwall
there
is
a
very
living
faith
in
the
legend
of
the
dead
and
that
this
cornish
legend
of
the
dead
with
its
peculiar
brythonic
character
should
be
parallel
as
it
is
to
the
breton
legend
of
the
dead
has
heretofore
so
far
as
i
am
aware
not
been
pointed
out
i
am
giving
however
only
a
very
few
of
the
cornish
collected
because
in
essence
most
of
them
are
alike
a
cornish
historian
testimony
i
was
privileged
to
make
my
first
call
in
rural
cornwall
at
the
pretty
country
home
of
miss
susan
gay
of
crill
about
three
miles
from
falmouth
and
miss
gay
who
has
written
a
history
of
falmouth
london
very
willingly
accorded
me
an
interview
on
the
subject
of
my
inquiry
and
finally
dictated
for
my
use
the
following
matter
as
plane
pixies
and
fairies
are
little
beings
in
the
human
form
existing
on
the
plane
who
may
be
in
the
process
of
evolution
and
as
such
i
believe
people
have
seen
them
the
plane
is
not
known
to
us
now
because
our
psychic
faculty
of
perception
has
faded
out
by
and
this
condition
has
been
brought
about
by
an
almost
exclusive
development
of
the
physical
brain
but
it
is
likely
that
the
psychic
faculty
will
develop
again
in
its
turn
interpretation
of
is
my
point
of
view
that
there
is
a
basis
of
truth
in
the
with
its
remnants
of
occult
learning
magic
charms
and
the
like
seems
to
be
the
remains
of
forgotten
psychical
facts
rather
than
history
as
it
is
often
called
peasant
evidence
from
the
crill
country
miss
gay
kindly
gave
me
the
names
of
certain
peasants
in
the
crill
region
and
from
one
of
them
harriett
christopher
i
gleaned
the
following
material
pisky
woman
who
lived
near
breage
church
had
a
fine
girl
baby
and
she
thought
the
piskies
came
and
took
it
and
put
a
withered
child
in
its
place
the
withered
child
lived
to
be
twenty
years
old
and
was
no
larger
when
it
died
than
when
the
piskies
brought
it
it
was
fretful
and
peevish
and
frightfully
shrivelled
the
parents
believed
that
the
piskies
often
used
to
come
and
look
over
a
certain
wall
by
the
house
to
see
the
child
and
i
heard
my
grandmother
say
that
the
family
once
put
the
child
out
of
doors
at
night
to
see
if
the
piskies
would
take
it
back
again
of
piskies
are
said
to
be
very
small
you
could
never
see
them
by
day
i
used
to
hear
my
grandmother
who
has
been
dead
fifty
years
say
that
the
piskies
used
to
hold
a
fair
in
the
fields
near
breage
and
that
people
saw
them
there
dancing
i
also
remember
her
saying
that
it
was
customary
to
set
out
food
for
the
piskies
at
night
my
grandmother
great
belief
was
in
piskies
and
in
spirits
and
she
considered
piskies
spirits
she
used
to
tell
so
many
stories
about
spirits
of
the
dead
coming
back
and
such
things
that
i
would
be
afraid
to
go
to
bed
evidence
from
constantine
our
witnesses
from
the
ancient
and
picturesque
village
of
constantine
are
john
wilmet
years
old
and
his
good
wife
two
most
excellent
and
types
of
the
passing
generation
of
true
cornish
stock
john
began
by
telling
me
the
following
tale
about
an
a
tale
which
in
one
version
or
another
is
apt
to
be
told
of
most
cornish
megaliths
murphy
who
married
my
sister
once
went
to
the
at
bosahan
with
a
surveyor
and
the
two
of
them
heard
such
unearthly
noises
in
it
that
they
came
running
home
in
great
excitement
saying
they
had
heard
the
piskies
pisky
a
farm
near
here
a
pisky
used
to
come
at
night
to
thrash
the
farmer
corn
the
farmer
in
payment
once
put
down
a
new
suit
for
him
when
the
pisky
came
and
saw
it
he
put
it
on
and
said
pisky
fine
and
pisky
gay
pisky
now
will
fly
away
and
they
say
he
never
returned
of
always
understood
the
piskies
to
be
little
people
a
great
deal
was
said
about
ghosts
in
this
place
whether
or
not
piskies
are
the
same
as
ghosts
i
can
not
tell
but
i
fancy
the
old
folks
thought
they
were
farmer
who
lived
two
miles
from
here
near
the
gweek
river
called
parson
jago
to
his
house
to
have
him
quiet
the
ghosts
or
spirits
regularly
haunting
it
for
parson
jago
could
always
put
such
things
to
rest
the
clergyman
went
to
the
farmer
house
and
with
his
whip
formed
a
circle
on
the
floor
and
then
commanded
the
spirit
which
made
its
appearance
on
the
table
to
come
down
into
the
circle
while
on
the
table
the
spirit
had
been
visible
to
all
the
family
but
as
soon
as
it
got
into
the
ring
it
disappeared
and
the
house
was
never
haunted
afterwards
at
michael
mount
marazion
our
next
place
for
an
investigation
of
the
surviving
cornish
is
marazion
the
very
ancient
british
town
opposite
the
isle
called
michael
mount
from
constantine
i
walked
through
the
country
to
this
point
talking
with
as
many
old
people
as
possible
but
none
of
them
knew
very
much
about
ancient
cornish
beliefs
it
is
believed
though
the
matter
is
very
doubtful
that
marazion
was
the
chief
mart
for
the
tin
trade
of
celtic
britain
and
that
the
mount
sacred
to
the
sun
and
to
the
pagan
mysteries
long
before
caesar
crossed
the
channel
from
gaul
sheltered
the
of
the
phoenicians
in
such
a
romantic
town
where
oriental
merchants
and
celtic
pilgrims
probably
once
mingled
together
one
might
expect
some
survival
of
olden
beliefs
and
customs
to
thomas
jago
of
marazion
with
a
memory
extending
backwards
more
than
seventy
years
he
being
eighty
years
old
i
am
indebted
for
this
statement
about
the
pisky
creed
in
that
locality
imagine
that
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
the
belief
in
piskies
and
spirits
was
general
in
my
boyhood
days
piskies
were
often
called
the
mites
little
people
they
were
regarded
as
little
spirits
the
word
is
the
old
cornish
brogue
for
pixies
in
certain
grass
fields
mushrooms
growing
in
a
circle
might
be
seen
of
a
morning
and
the
old
folks
pointing
to
the
mushrooms
would
say
to
the
children
oh
the
piskies
have
been
dancing
there
last
night
two
more
of
the
oldest
natives
of
marazion
among
others
with
whom
i
talked
are
william
rowe
years
old
and
his
married
sister
years
old
about
the
piskies
rowe
said
this
would
go
out
at
night
and
lose
their
way
and
then
declare
that
they
had
been
i
think
they
meant
by
this
that
they
fell
under
some
spiritual
influence
that
some
spirit
led
them
astray
the
piskies
were
said
to
be
small
and
they
were
thought
of
as
spirits
sister
added
we
as
children
did
anything
wrong
the
old
folks
would
say
to
us
the
piskies
will
carry
you
away
if
you
do
that
again
i
heard
the
following
from
a
lawyer
a
native
of
the
district
who
lives
in
the
country
just
beyond
marazion
thomas
of
wendron
parish
who
died
within
the
last
years
was
the
last
i
know
about
in
west
cornwall
he
was
supposed
to
have
great
power
over
evil
spirits
his
immediate
predecessor
was
a
woman
called
the
witch
of
wendron
and
she
did
a
big
business
my
father
once
visited
her
in
company
with
a
friend
whose
father
had
lost
some
horses
this
was
about
seventy
to
eighty
years
ago
the
witch
when
consulted
on
this
occasion
turned
her
back
to
my
father
companion
and
began
talking
to
herself
in
cornish
then
she
gave
him
some
herbs
his
father
used
the
herbs
and
no
more
horses
died
the
herbs
were
supposed
to
have
driven
all
evil
spirits
out
of
the
stable
in
penzance
an
architect
testimony
penzance
from
earliest
times
has
undoubtedly
been
as
it
is
now
the
capital
of
the
land
end
district
the
sacred
land
of
britain
and
in
penzance
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
those
among
its
leading
citizens
who
still
cherish
and
keep
alive
the
poetry
and
the
mystic
lore
of
old
cornwall
and
to
no
one
of
them
am
i
more
indebted
than
to
henry
maddern
maddern
tells
me
that
he
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
cornish
of
this
region
when
a
boy
in
newlyn
where
he
was
born
by
his
old
nurse
betty
grancan
a
native
zennor
woman
of
stock
probably
the
most
primitive
and
pure
in
the
british
islands
at
his
home
in
penzance
maddern
dictated
to
me
the
very
valuable
evidence
which
follows
kinds
of
this
region
there
are
two
kinds
of
pixies
one
purely
a
pixy
and
the
other
a
pixy
which
dwells
on
the
between
high
and
low
water
mark
the
pixy
was
usually
thought
to
be
full
of
mischievous
fun
but
it
did
no
harm
there
was
a
very
prevalent
belief
when
i
was
a
boy
that
this
pixy
called
had
to
be
propitiated
by
a
three
of
fish
to
ensure
the
fishermen
having
a
good
catch
of
fish
the
land
pixy
was
supposed
to
be
able
to
render
its
devotees
invisible
if
they
only
anointed
their
eyes
with
a
certain
green
salve
made
of
secret
herbs
gathered
from
in
the
invisible
condition
thus
induced
people
were
able
to
join
the
pixy
revels
during
which
according
to
the
old
tradition
time
slipped
away
very
very
rapidly
though
people
returned
from
the
pixies
no
older
than
when
they
went
with
them
nurse
and
the
used
to
hear
about
a
zennor
girl
who
came
to
newlyn
as
nurse
to
the
child
of
a
gentleman
living
at
the
gentleman
warned
her
never
to
touch
a
box
of
ointment
which
he
guarded
in
a
special
room
nor
even
to
enter
that
room
but
one
day
in
his
absence
she
entered
the
room
and
took
some
of
the
ointment
suspecting
the
qualities
of
the
ointment
she
put
it
on
her
eyes
with
the
wish
that
she
might
see
where
her
master
was
she
immediately
found
herself
in
the
higher
part
of
the
orchard
amongst
the
pixies
where
they
were
having
much
festivity
and
dancing
and
there
saw
the
gentleman
whose
child
she
had
nursed
for
a
time
she
managed
to
evade
him
but
before
the
was
at
an
end
he
discovered
her
and
requested
her
to
go
home
and
then
to
her
intense
astonishment
she
learned
that
she
had
been
away
twenty
years
though
she
was
unchanged
the
gentleman
scolded
her
for
having
touched
the
ointment
paid
her
wages
in
full
and
sent
her
back
to
her
people
she
always
had
the
one
regret
that
she
had
not
gone
into
the
forbidden
room
at
first
tolcarne
fairy
of
the
newlyn
tolcarne
was
in
some
ways
like
the
puck
of
the
english
midlands
but
this
fairy
or
troll
was
supposed
to
date
back
to
the
time
of
the
phoenicians
he
was
described
as
a
little
old
man
dressed
in
a
leathern
jerkin
with
a
hood
on
his
head
who
lived
invisible
in
the
rock
whenever
he
chose
to
do
so
he
could
make
himself
visible
when
i
was
a
boy
it
was
said
that
he
spent
his
time
voyaging
from
here
to
tyre
on
the
galleys
which
carried
the
tin
and
also
that
he
assisted
in
the
building
of
solomon
temple
sometimes
he
was
called
the
wandering
one
or
odin
the
wanderer
my
old
nurse
betty
grancan
used
to
say
that
you
could
call
up
the
troll
at
the
tolcarne
if
while
there
you
held
in
your
hand
three
dried
leaves
one
of
the
ash
one
of
the
oak
and
one
of
the
thorn
and
pronounced
an
incantation
or
charm
betty
would
never
tell
me
the
words
of
the
charm
because
she
said
i
was
too
much
of
a
sceptic
the
words
of
such
a
cornish
charm
had
to
pass
from
one
believer
to
another
through
a
woman
to
a
man
and
from
a
man
to
a
woman
and
thus
alternately
of
were
often
supposed
to
be
the
souls
of
the
prehistoric
dwellers
of
this
country
as
such
pixies
were
supposed
to
be
getting
smaller
and
smaller
until
finally
they
are
to
vanish
entirely
the
country
pixies
inhabiting
the
highlands
from
above
newlyn
on
to
just
were
considered
a
wicked
sort
their
great
ambition
was
to
change
their
own
offspring
for
human
children
and
the
true
child
could
only
be
got
back
by
laying
a
clover
on
the
changeling
a
child
one
which
was
weak
frail
and
peevish
was
of
the
nature
of
a
changeling
miner
pixies
called
knockers
would
accept
a
portion
of
a
miner
lunch
on
good
faith
and
by
knocking
lead
him
to
a
rich
or
warn
him
by
knocking
if
there
was
danger
ahead
or
a
cavern
full
of
water
but
if
the
miner
begrudged
them
the
he
would
be
left
to
his
own
resources
to
find
the
lode
and
moreover
the
knockers
would
do
all
they
could
to
lead
him
away
from
a
good
lode
these
mine
pixies
too
were
supposed
to
be
spirits
sometimes
spirits
of
the
miners
of
ancient
times
and
general
appearance
the
fairies
were
much
the
same
as
pixies
they
were
small
men
and
women
much
smaller
than
dwarfs
the
men
were
swarthy
in
complexion
and
the
women
had
a
clear
complexion
of
a
bloom
none
ever
appeared
to
be
more
than
to
thirty
years
old
i
have
heard
my
nurse
say
that
she
could
see
scores
of
them
whenever
she
picked
a
clover
and
put
it
in
the
wisp
of
straw
which
she
carried
on
her
head
as
a
cushion
for
the
bucket
of
milk
her
theory
was
that
the
richness
of
the
milk
was
what
attracted
them
pixies
like
fairies
very
much
enjoyed
milk
and
people
of
miserly
nature
used
to
put
salt
around
a
cow
to
keep
the
pixies
away
and
then
the
pixies
would
lead
such
mean
people
astray
the
very
first
opportunity
that
came
according
to
some
the
pixies
have
been
seen
in
the
but
usually
they
are
only
seen
at
night
a
cornish
editor
opinion
herbert
thomas
editor
of
four
cornish
papers
cornish
and
and
a
true
celt
himself
has
been
deeply
interested
in
the
of
cornwall
and
has
made
excellent
use
of
it
in
his
poetry
and
other
literary
productions
so
that
his
personal
opinions
which
follow
as
to
the
probable
origin
of
the
are
for
our
study
a
very
important
contribution
origin
of
belief
in
should
say
that
the
modern
belief
in
pixies
or
in
fairies
arose
from
a
very
ancient
celtic
or
belief
in
spirits
just
as
among
some
savage
tribes
there
is
belief
in
gods
and
totems
here
there
was
belief
in
little
spirits
good
and
bad
who
were
able
to
help
or
to
hinder
man
belief
in
the
supernatural
in
my
opinion
is
the
root
of
it
all
a
cornish
testimony
in
penzance
i
had
the
privilege
of
also
meeting
miss
courtney
the
who
quite
agrees
with
me
in
believing
that
there
is
in
cornwall
a
widespread
legend
of
the
dead
and
she
cited
a
few
special
instances
in
illustration
as
follows
legend
of
the
amongst
the
fishermen
and
sailors
there
is
a
belief
that
the
dead
in
the
sea
will
be
heard
calling
if
a
drowning
is
about
to
occur
i
know
of
a
woman
who
went
to
a
clergyman
to
have
him
exorcize
her
of
the
spirit
of
her
dead
sister
which
she
said
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
bee
and
i
have
heard
of
miners
believing
that
white
moths
are
spirits
evidence
from
newlyn
in
newlyn
jane
tregurtha
gave
the
following
important
testimony
old
people
thoroughly
believed
in
the
and
that
they
gambolled
all
over
the
moors
on
moonlight
nights
some
pixies
would
rain
down
blessings
and
others
curses
and
to
remove
the
curses
people
would
go
to
the
wells
blessed
by
the
saints
whenever
anything
went
wrong
in
the
kitchen
at
night
the
pixies
were
blamed
after
the
of
october
or
after
halloween
the
blackberries
are
not
fit
to
eat
for
the
pixies
have
then
been
over
them
cf
the
parallel
irish
belief
guardian
of
the
the
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
guardian
fairy
or
pixy
who
can
make
miraculous
cures
and
my
mother
knew
of
an
actual
case
in
which
a
changeling
was
put
through
the
stone
in
order
to
get
the
real
child
back
it
seems
that
evil
pixies
changed
children
and
that
the
pixy
at
the
being
good
could
in
opposition
undo
their
work
spirit
was
put
to
rest
on
the
green
here
in
newlyn
the
parson
prayed
and
fasted
and
then
commanded
the
spirit
to
dip
dry
the
sea
with
a
limpet
shell
containing
no
bottom
and
the
spirit
is
supposed
to
be
still
busy
at
this
task
as
when
i
talked
with
her
in
her
neat
cottage
at
newlyn
miss
mary
ann
chirgwin
who
was
born
on
michael
mount
in
told
me
this
old
people
used
to
say
the
piskies
were
apparitions
of
the
dead
come
back
in
the
form
of
little
people
but
i
ca
remember
anything
more
than
this
about
them
an
artist
testimony
one
of
the
members
of
the
newlyn
art
school
was
able
to
offer
a
few
of
his
own
impressions
concerning
the
pixies
of
devonshire
where
he
has
frequently
made
sketches
of
pixies
from
descriptions
given
to
him
by
peasants
all
the
west
of
devonshire
anywhere
near
the
moorlands
the
country
people
are
much
given
to
belief
in
pixies
and
ghosts
i
think
they
expect
to
see
them
about
the
twilight
hour
though
i
have
not
found
anybody
who
has
actually
seen
a
pixy
the
belief
now
is
largely
based
on
hearsay
testimony
from
the
historian
of
mousehole
to
richard
harry
the
historian
of
mousehole
i
am
indebted
for
these
remarks
about
the
nature
and
present
state
of
the
belief
in
pixies
as
he
observes
it
in
that
region
pixy
piskies
thought
of
as
little
people
who
appear
on
moonlight
nights
are
still
somewhat
believed
in
here
if
interfered
with
too
much
they
are
said
to
exhibit
almost
fiendish
powers
in
a
certain
sense
they
are
considered
spiritual
but
in
another
sense
they
are
much
materialized
in
the
conceptions
of
the
people
generally
speaking
the
belief
in
them
has
almost
died
out
within
the
last
fifty
years
a
seaman
testimony
billy
pender
as
our
present
witness
is
familiarly
called
is
one
of
the
oldest
natives
of
mousehole
being
years
old
and
most
of
his
life
has
been
passed
on
the
ocean
as
a
fisherman
seaman
and
pilot
after
having
told
me
the
usual
things
about
piskies
fairies
spirits
ghosts
and
the
devil
uncle
billy
pender
was
very
soon
talking
about
the
dead
legend
of
the
was
up
in
bed
and
i
suppose
asleep
and
i
dreamt
that
the
boy
james
came
to
my
bedside
and
woke
me
up
by
saying
how
many
lights
does
death
put
up
and
in
the
dream
there
appeared
such
light
as
i
never
saw
in
my
life
and
when
i
woke
up
another
light
like
it
was
in
the
room
within
three
months
afterwards
we
buried
two
out
of
this
house
this
was
four
years
ago
when
this
strange
tale
was
finished
uncle
billy
pender
daughter
who
had
been
listening
added
three
mornings
one
after
another
there
was
a
robin
at
our
cellar
door
before
the
deaths
and
my
husband
said
he
did
like
that
then
uncle
billy
told
this
weird
tale
granny
told
about
a
boat
named
going
from
newlyn
to
bristol
with
six
thousand
mackerel
which
put
in
at
arbor
cove
close
to
padstow
on
account
of
bad
weather
the
boat
dragged
her
anchors
and
was
lost
granny
afterwards
declared
that
he
saw
the
crew
going
up
over
the
newlyn
slip
and
the
whole
of
newlyn
and
mousehole
believed
him
testimony
by
two
land
end
farmers
in
the
sennen
country
within
a
mile
of
the
end
of
britain
i
talked
with
two
farmers
who
knew
something
about
piskies
the
first
one
charles
hutchen
of
trevescan
told
me
this
legend
just
just
on
christmas
day
a
pisky
carried
away
in
his
cloak
a
boy
but
the
boy
got
home
then
the
pisky
took
him
a
second
time
and
again
the
boy
got
home
each
time
the
boy
was
away
for
only
an
hour
probably
in
a
dream
or
trance
state
the
frank
ellis
years
old
of
the
same
village
of
trevescan
then
gave
the
following
evidence
on
green
there
are
two
rings
where
the
piskies
used
to
dance
and
play
music
on
a
moonlight
night
i
heard
that
they
would
come
there
from
the
moors
they
are
called
if
you
keep
quiet
when
they
are
dancing
you
see
them
but
if
you
make
any
noise
disappear
frank
ellis
wife
who
is
a
very
aged
woman
was
in
the
house
listening
to
the
conversation
and
added
at
this
point
grandmother
nancy
maddern
was
down
on
green
by
moonlight
and
saw
the
piskies
dancing
and
passed
near
them
she
said
they
were
like
little
children
and
had
red
cloaks
testimony
from
a
sennen
cove
fisherman
john
gilbert
guy
years
old
a
retired
fisherman
of
sennen
cove
offers
very
valuable
testimony
as
follows
say
they
have
seen
the
here
by
the
hundreds
in
ireland
they
call
the
the
fairies
my
mother
believes
there
were
such
things
and
so
did
the
old
folks
in
these
parts
my
grandmother
used
to
put
down
a
good
furze
fire
for
on
stormy
nights
because
as
she
said
are
a
sort
of
people
wandering
about
the
world
with
no
home
or
habitation
and
ought
to
be
given
a
little
comfort
the
most
fear
of
was
that
they
might
come
at
night
and
change
a
baby
for
one
that
was
no
good
my
mother
said
that
joan
nicholas
believed
the
fairies
had
changed
her
baby
because
it
was
very
small
and
up
on
the
hill
you
see
a
round
ring
with
grass
greener
than
anywhere
else
and
that
is
where
the
used
to
dance
of
seeing
the
heard
that
a
woman
set
out
water
to
wash
her
baby
in
and
that
before
she
had
used
the
water
the
came
and
washed
their
babies
in
it
she
did
know
about
this
and
so
in
washing
her
baby
got
some
of
the
water
in
her
eyes
and
then
all
at
once
she
could
see
crowds
of
about
her
one
of
them
came
to
her
and
asked
if
she
was
able
to
see
their
crowd
and
when
she
said
yes
the
wanted
to
take
her
eyes
out
and
she
had
to
clear
away
from
them
as
fast
as
she
could
testimony
from
a
cornish
miner
william
shepherd
a
retired
miner
of
pendeen
near
just
where
he
has
passed
all
his
life
offers
us
from
his
own
experiences
under
the
earth
the
evidence
which
follows
are
which
are
not
the
knockers
i
heard
old
men
in
the
mines
say
that
they
have
seen
them
and
they
call
them
the
it
appears
that
they
do
like
company
for
they
are
always
seen
singly
the
knockers
are
spirits
too
as
one
might
say
they
are
said
to
bring
bad
luck
while
the
may
bring
good
luck
testimony
from
king
arthur
country
leaving
the
land
end
district
and
south
cornwall
we
now
pass
northward
to
king
arthur
country
our
chief
researches
there
are
to
be
made
outside
the
beaten
track
of
tourists
as
far
as
possible
in
the
country
between
camelford
and
tintagel
at
delabole
the
centre
of
this
district
we
find
our
first
witness
henry
spragg
a
retired
seventy
years
old
spragg
has
had
excellent
opportunities
of
hearing
any
that
might
have
been
living
during
his
lifetime
and
what
he
offers
first
is
about
king
arthur
always
thought
of
king
arthur
as
a
great
warrior
and
many
a
time
i
heard
old
people
say
that
he
used
to
appear
in
this
country
in
the
form
of
a
nath
this
was
all
that
could
be
told
of
king
arthur
and
the
conversation
finally
was
directed
toward
piskies
with
the
following
results
man
named
bottrell
who
lived
near
teath
was
at
west
down
and
when
he
turned
his
pockets
inside
out
he
heard
the
piskies
going
away
laughing
often
my
grandmother
used
to
say
when
i
got
home
after
dark
you
had
better
mind
or
the
piskies
will
carry
you
away
and
i
can
remember
hearing
the
old
people
say
that
the
piskies
are
the
spirits
of
children
from
pixies
the
conversation
drifted
to
the
heard
at
night
near
certain
haunted
downs
in
teath
parish
and
then
finally
to
ordinary
cornish
legends
about
the
dead
our
next
witnesses
from
delabole
are
john
male
years
old
one
of
the
very
oldest
men
in
king
arthur
country
and
his
wife
and
all
of
mr
male
ancestors
as
far
back
as
he
can
trace
them
have
lived
in
the
same
parish
in
mr
male
remarked
have
heard
a
good
deal
about
the
piskies
but
i
ca
remember
any
of
the
old
women
tales
i
have
heard
too
of
people
saying
that
they
had
seen
the
piskies
it
was
thought
that
when
the
piskies
have
misled
you
they
show
themselves
jumping
about
in
front
of
you
they
are
a
race
of
little
people
who
live
out
in
the
fields
mrs
male
had
now
joined
us
at
the
open
fire
and
added
always
come
at
night
and
in
marshy
ground
there
are
round
places
called
pisky
beds
where
they
play
when
i
was
little
my
mother
and
grandmother
would
be
sitting
round
the
fire
of
an
evening
telling
fireside
stories
and
i
can
remember
hearing
about
a
pisky
of
this
part
who
stole
a
new
coat
and
how
the
family
heard
him
talking
to
himself
about
it
and
then
finally
say
pisky
fine
and
pisky
gay
pisky
got
a
bright

i
can
just
remember
one
bit
of
another
story
a
pisky
looked
into
a
house
and
said
all
alone
fair
maid
no
here
am
i
with
a
dog
and
cat
and
apples
to
eat
and
nuts
to
crack
a
retired
rural
policeman
of
the
tintagel
country
where
he
was
born
and
reared
and
now
keeper
of
the
passmore
edwards
art
gallery
at
newlyn
offered
this
testimony
from
tintagel
tintagel
i
used
to
sit
round
the
fire
at
night
and
hear
old
women
tell
so
much
about
piskies
and
ghosts
that
i
was
then
afraid
to
go
out
of
doors
after
darkness
had
fallen
they
religiously
believed
in
such
things
and
when
i
expressed
my
doubts
i
was
driven
away
as
a
rude
boy
they
thought
if
you
went
to
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
that
you
could
there
see
the
piskies
as
little
spirits
it
was
held
that
the
piskies
could
lead
you
astray
and
play
tricks
on
you
but
that
they
never
did
you
any
serious
injury
of
the
arthurian
at
tintagel

said
spirit
of

mon

me
souvient
que
lors
de
votre
soutenance
de
thèse
devant
la
faculté
des

de
de
rennes
un
de
mes
collègues
mon
ami
le

vous
demanda
croyez
à
des
fées
en

vous
répondîtes
avec
autant
de
phlegme
que
de
sincérité
tout
fait
pour
en
voir
et
je
ai
jamais
vu
mais
il
y
a
beaucoup
de
choses
que
vous
pas
vues
monsieur
le
professeur
et
dont
vous
ne
songeriez
cependant
pas
à
nier
ainsi
à
des
fées
je
suis
comme
vous
mon
cher
monsieur
wentz
je
jamais
vu
de
fées
bien
une
amie
très
chère
que
nous
avons
baptisée
de
ce
nom
mais
malgré
tous
ses
beaux
dons
magiques
elle
humble
mortelle
en
revanche
vécu
tout
enfant
parmi
des
personnes
qui
avaient
avec
les
fées
véritables
un
commerce
quasi
journalier
dans
une
petite
bourgade
de
peuplée
de
paysans
à
moitié
marins
et
de
marins
à
moitié
paysans
il
y
avait
non
loin
du
village
une
ancienne
gentilhommière
que
ses
propriétaires
avaient
depuis
longtemps
abandonnée
pour
on
ne
savait
au
juste
quel
motif
on
continuait
de
le
de
lanascol
ne
fût
plus
guère
ruine
il
est
vrai
que
les
avenues
par
lesquelles
on
y
accédait
avaient
conservé
leur
aspect
seigneurial
avec
leurs
quadruples
rangées
de
vieux
hêtres
dont
les
vastes
frondaisons
se
miraient
dans
de
magnifiques
étangs
les
gens
se
risquaient
peu
le
soir
dans
ces
avenues
elles
passaient
pour
être
à
partir
du
coucher
du
soleil
le
lieu
de
promenade
favori
que
désignait
sous
le
nom
de
la
de
lanascol
beaucoup
disaient
rencontrée
et
la
dépeignaient
sous
les
couleurs
du
reste
les
plus
diverses
faisaient
une
vieille
femme
marchant
toute
courbée
les
deux
mains
appuyées
sur
un
tronçon
de
béquille
avec
lequel
de
temps
en
temps
elle
remuait
à
les
feuilles
mortes
les
feuilles
mortes
retournait
ainsi
devenaient
soudain
brillantes
comme
de
et
avec
un
bruit
clair
de
métal
selon
une
jeune
princesse
merveilleusement
parée
sur
les
pas
de
qui
petits
hommes
noirs
et
silencieux
elle
majestueuse
allure
de
reine
parfois
elle
devant
un
arbre
et
aussitôt
comme
pour
recevoir
ses
ordres
ou
bien
elle
jetait
un
regard
sur
étang
et
frissonnait
ses
profondeurs
comme
agité
mouvement
de
crainte
sous
la
puissance
de
son
regard
on
racontait
sur
elle
cette
curieuse
histoire
les
propriétaires
de
lanascol
ayant
voulu
se
défaire
domaine
plus
le
manoir
et
les
terres
qui
en
dépendaient
furent
mis
en
adjudication
chez
un
notaire
de
plouaret
au
jour
fixé
pour
les
enchères
nombre
accoururent
les
prix
étaient
déjà
montés
très
haut
et
le
domaine
allait
être
adjugé
quand
à
un
dernier
appel
du
crieur
une
voix
féminine
très
douce
et
très
impérieuse
tout
ensemble
et
dit
francs
de
plus
il
y
eut
grande
rumeur
dans
la
salle
tout
le
monde
chercha
des
yeux
la
personne
qui
avait
lancé
cette
surenchère
et
qui
ne
pouvait
être
femme
mais
il
ne
se
trouva
pas
une
seule
femme
dans
le
notaire
demanda
a
parlé
de
nouveau
la
même
voix
se
fit
entendre
lanascol
ce
fut
une
débandade
générale
depuis
lors
il
ne
jamais
présenté
et
voilà
pourquoi
couramment
lanascol
était
toujours
à
vendre
si
je
vous
ai
entretenu
à
plaisir
de
la
fée
de
lanascol
mon
cher
monsieur
wentz
est
la
première
qui
ait
fait
impression
sur
moi
dans
mon
enfance
combien
pas
connu
par
la
suite
à
travers
les
récits
de
mes
compatriotes
des
grèves
des
champs
ou
des
bois
la
bretagne
est
restée
un
royaume
de
féerie
on
peut
voyager
lieue
sans
côtoyer
la
demeure
de
quelque
fée
mâle
ou
femelle
ces
jours
derniers
comme
un
pèlerinage
à
forêt
de
paimpont
toute
hantée
encore
des
grands
souvenirs
de
la
légende
celtique
je
croisai
sous
les
opulents
ombrages
du
une
ramasseuse
de
bois
mort
avec
qui
je
ne
manquai
pas
vous
pensez
bien
de
lier
conversation
un
des
premiers
noms
que
je
prononçai
fut
naturellement
celui
de
viviane
se
récria
la
vieille
pauvresse
bénie
la
bonne
dame
car
elle
est
aussi
bonne
que
belle
sans
sa
protection
mon
homme
qui
travaille
dans
les
coupes
serait
tombé
comme
un
loup
sous
les
fusils
des
gardes
et
elle
se
mit
à
me
conter
comme
quoi
son
mari
un
tantinet
braconnier
comme
tous
les
bûcherons
de
ces
parages
porté
une
nuit
à
du
chevreuil
dans
les
environs
de
la
avait
été
surpris
en
flagrant
délit
par
une
tournée
de
gardes
il
voulut
fuir
les
gardes
tirèrent
une
balle
à
la
cuisse
il
tomba
et
il
à
se
faire
tuer
sur
place
plutôt
que
de
se
rendre
lorsque
entre
ses
agresseurs
et
lui
subitement
une
espèce
de
brouillard
très
dense
qui
voila
tout
le
sol
les
arbres
les
gardes
et
le
blessé
et
il
entendit
une
voix
sortie
du
brouillard
une
voix
légère
comme
un
bruit
de
feuilles
murmurer
à
son
oreille
mon
fils
de
viviane
veillera
sur
toi
ce
que
tu
aies
rampé
hors
de
la
forêt
furent
les
propres
paroles
de
la
fée
conclut
la
ramasseuse
de
bois
mort
et
dévotement
elle
se
signa
car
la
religieuse
bretagne
vous
le
savez
vénère
les
fées
à
des
saintes
faut
rattacher
les
lutins
au
monde
des
fées
mais
ce
qui
est
sûr
que
cette
charmante
et
malicieuse
engeance
a
toujours
pullulé
dans
notre
pays
je
me
suis
laissé
dire
chaque
maison
avait
le
sien
quelque
chose
comme
le
petit
dieu
pénate
tantôt
visible
tantôt
invisible
il
présidait
à
tous
les
actes
de
la
vie
domestique
mieux
encore
il
y
participait
et
de
la
façon
la
plus
efficace
a
du
logis
il
aidait
les
servantes
soufflait
le
feu
dans
surveillait
la
cuisson
de
la
nourriture
pour
les
hommes
ou
pour
les
bêtes
apaisait
les
cris
de
couché
dans
le
bas
de
empêchait
les
vers
de
se
mettre
dans
les
pièces
de
lard
suspendues
aux
solives
il
avait
pareillement
dans
son
lot
le
gouvernement
des
étables
et
des
écuries
grâce
à
lui
les
vaches
donnaient
un
lait
abondant
en
beurre
et
les
chevaux
avaient
la
croupe
ronde
le
poil
luisant
il
était
en
un
mot
le
bon
génie
de
la
famille
mais
à
la
condition
que
chacun
eût
pour
lui
les
égards
auxquels
il
avait
droit
si
peu
lui
manquât
sa
bonté
se
changeait
en
malice
et
il
point
de
mauvais
tours
dont
il
ne
fût
capable
envers
les
gens
qui
offensé
comme
de
renverser
le
contenu
des
marmites
sur
le
foyer
la
laine
autour
des
quenouilles
de
rendre
infumable
le
tabac
des
pipes
inextricablement
les
crins
des
chevaux
de
dessécher
le
pis
des
vaches
ou
de
faire
peler
le
dos
des
brebis
aussi
de
ne
le
point
mécontenter
on
respectait
soigneusement
toutes
ses
habitudes
toutes
ses
manies
ainsi
que
chez
mes
parents
notre
vieille
bonne
filie
jamais
le
trépied
du
feu
sans
avoir
la
précaution
de
pour
le
refroidir
avant
de
le
ranger
au
coin
de
si
vous
lui
demandiez
pourquoi
ce
rite
elle
vous
répondait
que
le
lutin
ne
brûle
pas
si
tout
à
il
dessus
il
appartient
encore
je
suppose
à
la
catégorie
des
ce
ce
mystérieux
de
la
nuit
dont
les
bretons
des
campagnes
voient
se
dresser
au
crépuscule
la
haute
et
troublante
silhouette
si
il
leur
arrive
de
rentrer
tard
du
labour
on
jamais
pu
me
renseigner
exactement
sur
le
genre
de
troupeau
faisait
paître
ni
sur
ce
que
présageait
sa
rencontre
le
plus
souvent
on
la
redoute
mais
comme
avec
raison
une
de
mes
conteuses
lise
bellec
est
préférable
le
il
ne
pas
pour
cela
que
ce
soit
un
méchant
esprit
elle
il
remplirait
plutôt
une
fonction
salutaire
en
signifiant
aux
humains
par
sa
venue
que
la
nuit
pas
faite
pour
aux
champs
ou
sur
les
chemins
mais
pour
derrière
les
portes
closes
et
pour
dormir
ce
berger
des
ombres
serait
donc
somme
toute
une
manière
de
bon
pasteur
pour
assurer
notre
repos
et
notre
sécurité
pour
nous
soustraire
aux
excès
du
travail
et
aux
embûches
de
la
nuit
nous
force
brebis
imprudentes
à
regagner
promptement
le
bercail
sans
doute
un
rôle
tutélaire
à
peu
près
semblable
qui
dans
la
croyance
populaire
est
dévolu
à
un
autre
plus
spécialement
affecté
au
rivage
de
la
mer
comme
son
nom
de
il
a
pas
sur
tout
le
littoral
maritime
de
la
bretagne
ou
comme
on
dit
dans
tout
une
seule
région
ou
de
ce
des
grèves
ne
soit
tenue
pour
un
fait
certain
dûment
constaté
indéniable
on
lui
prête
des
formes
variables
et
des
aspects
différents
tantôt
un
géant
tantôt
un
nain
il
porte
tantôt
un
de
toile
huilée
tantôt
un
large
chapeau
de
feutre
noir
parfois
il
sur
une
rame
et
fait
penser
au
personnage
énigmatique
armé
du
même
attribut
doit
suivre
dans
mais
toujours
un
héros
marin
dont
la
mission
est
de
parcourir
les
plages
en
poussant
par
intervalles
de
longs
cris
stridents
propres
à
effrayer
les
pêcheurs
qui
se
seraient
laissé
surprendre
dehors
par
les
ténèbres
de
la
nuit
il
ne
fait
de
mal
ceux
qui
récalcitrent
encore
ne
les
que
dans
leur
intérêt
pour
les
contraindre
à
se
mettre
à
il
est
avant
tout
un
ses
cris
ne
rappellent
pas
seulement
au
logis
les
gens
attardés
sur
les
grèves
ils
signalent
aussi
le
dangereux
voisinage
de
la
côte
aux
marins
qui
sont
en
mer
et
par
là
suppléent
à
du
mugissement
des
sirènes
ou
de
la
lumière
des
phares
remarquons
à
ce
propos
relève
un
trait
analogue
dans
la
légende
des
vieux
saints
armoricains
pour
la
plupart
émigrés
un
de
leurs
exercices
coutumiers
consistait
à
déambuler
de
nuit
le
long
des
côtes
où
ils
avaient
établi
leurs
oratoires
en
agitant
des
clochettes
de
fer
battu
dont
les
tintements
étaient
destinés
comme
les
cris
de
à
prévenir
les
navigateurs
que
la
terre
était
proche
je
suis
persuadé
que
le
culte
des
saints
qui
est
la
première
et
la
plus
fervente
des
dévotions
bretonnes
conserve
bien
des
traits
religion
plus
ancienne
où
la
croyance
aux
fées
jouait
le
principal
rôle
et
il
en
va
de
même
suis
convaincu
pour
ces
mythes
funéraires
que
recueillis
sous
le
titre
de
légende
de
la
chez
les
bretons
armoricains
a
vrai
dire
dans
la
conception
bretonne
les
morts
ne
sont
pas
morts
ils
vivent
vie
mystérieuse
en
marge
de
la
vie
réelle
mais
leur
monde
reste
en
définitive
tout
mêlé
au
nôtre
et
sitôt
que
la
nuit
tombe
sitôt
que
les
vivants
proprement
dits
à
la
mort
momentanée
du
sommeil
les
morts
redeviennent
les
habitants
de
la
terre
jamais
quittée
ils
reprennent
leur
place
à
leur
foyer
ils
vaquent
à
leurs
anciens
travaux
ils
au
logis
aux
champs
à
la
barque
ils
se
comportent
en
un
mot
comme
ce
peuple
des
hommes
et
des
qui
formait
jadis
une
espèce
plus
fine
et
plus
délicate
au
milieu
de
la
véritable
humanité
encore
mon
cher
monsieur
wentz
bien
types
à
évoquer
dans
cet
intermonde
de
la
féerie
bretonne
qui
chez
mes
compatriotes
ne
se
confond
ni
avec
ce
ni
avec
mais
participe
à
la
fois
de
tous
les
deux
par
un
singulier
mélange
de
naturel
et
de
surnaturel
je
voulu
en
ces
lignes
rapides
que
montrer
la
richesse
de
la
matière
à
laquelle
vous
avez
avec
tant
de
conscience
et
de
ferveur
appliqué
votre
effort
et
maintenant
que
les
fées
vous
soient
douces
mon
cher
ami
elles
ne
seront
que
justes
en
favorisant
de
toute
leur
tendresse
le
jeune
et
brillant
écrivain
qui
vient
de
restaurer
leur
culte
en
rénovant
leur
gloire
rennes
ce
er
my
dear
wentz
i
recollect
that
at
the
time
of
your
examination
on
your
thesis
before
the
faculty
of
letters
of
the
university
of
rennes
one
of
my
colleagues
my
friend
professor
dottin
put
to
you
this
question
believe
you
assert
in
the
existence
of
fairies
have
you
seen
any
you
answered
with
equal
coolness
and
candour
i
have
made
every
effort
to
do
so
and
i
have
never
seen
any
but
there
are
many
things
which
you
sir
have
not
seen
and
of
which
nevertheless
you
would
not
think
of
denying
the
existence
that
is
my
attitude
toward
fairies
i
am
like
you
my
dear
wentz
i
have
never
seen
fairies
it
is
true
that
i
have
a
very
dear
lady
friend
whom
we
have
christened
by
that
name
fairy
but
in
spite
of
all
her
fair
supernatural
gifts
she
is
only
a
humble
mortal
on
the
other
hand
i
lived
when
a
mere
child
among
people
who
had
almost
daily
intercourse
with
real
fairies
that
was
in
a
little
township
in
lower
brittany
inhabited
by
peasants
who
were
half
sailors
and
by
sailors
who
were
half
peasants
there
was
not
far
from
the
village
an
ancient
long
abandoned
by
its
owners
for
what
reason
was
not
known
exactly
it
continued
to
be
called
the
of
lanascol
though
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
ruin
it
is
true
that
the
avenues
by
which
one
approached
it
had
retained
their
feudal
aspect
with
their
fourfold
rows
of
ancient
beeches
whose
huge
masses
of
foliage
were
reflected
in
splendid
pools
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
seldom
ventured
into
these
avenues
in
the
evening
they
were
supposed
to
be
from
sunset
onwards
the
favourite
of
a
who
went
by
the
name
of
the
of
lanascol
many
claimed
to
have
met
her
and
described
her
in
colours
which
were
however
the
most
varied
some
represented
her
as
an
old
woman
who
walked
all
bent
her
two
hands
leaning
on
a
stump
of
a
crutch
with
which
in
autumn
from
time
to
time
she
stirred
the
dead
leaves
the
dead
leaves
which
she
thus
stirred
became
suddenly
shining
like
gold
and
clinked
against
one
another
with
the
clear
sound
of
metal
according
to
others
it
was
a
young
princess
marvellously
adorned
after
whom
there
hurried
curious
little
black
silent
men
she
advanced
with
a
majestic
and
queenly
bearing
sometimes
she
stopped
in
front
of
a
tree
and
the
tree
at
once
bent
down
as
if
to
receive
her
commands
or
again
she
would
cast
a
look
on
the
water
of
a
pool
and
the
pool
trembled
to
its
very
depths
as
though
stirred
by
an
access
of
fear
beneath
the
potency
of
her
look
the
following
strange
story
was
told
about
her
the
owners
of
lanascol
having
desired
to
get
rid
of
an
estate
which
they
no
longer
occupied
the
manor
and
lands
attached
to
it
were
put
up
to
auction
by
a
notary
of
plouaret
on
the
day
fixed
for
the
bidding
a
number
of
purchasers
presented
themselves
the
price
had
already
reached
a
large
sum
and
the
estate
was
on
the
point
of
being
knocked
down
when
on
a
last
appeal
from
the
auctioneer
a
female
voice
very
gentle
and
at
the
same
time
very
imperious
was
raised
and
said
thousand
francs
more
a
great
commotion
arose
in
the
hall
every
one
eyes
sought
for
the
person
who
had
made
this
advance
and
who
could
only
be
a
woman
but
there
was
not
a
single
woman
among
those
present
the
notary
asked
spoke
again
the
same
voice
made
itself
heard
fairy
of
lanascol
it
replied
a
general
followed
from
that
time
forward
no
purchaser
has
ever
appeared
and
as
the
current
report
ran
that
was
the
reason
why
lanascol
continued
to
be
for
sale
i
have
designedly
quoted
to
you
the
story
of
the
fairy
of
lanascol
my
dear
wentz
because
she
was
the
first
to
make
an
impression
on
me
in
my
childhood
how
many
others
have
i
come
to
know
later
on
in
the
course
of
narratives
from
those
who
lived
with
me
on
the
sandy
beaches
in
the
fields
or
the
woods
brittany
has
always
been
a
kingdom
of
faerie
one
can
not
there
travel
even
a
league
without
brushing
past
the
dwelling
of
some
male
or
female
fairy
quite
lately
in
the
course
of
an
autumn
pilgrimage
to
the
hallucinatory
forest
of
paimpont
or
brocéliande
still
haunted
throughout
by
the
great
memories
of
celtic
legend
i
encountered
beneath
the
thick
foliage
of
the
a
woman
gathering
faggots
with
whom
i
did
not
fail
as
you
may
well
imagine
to
enter
into
conversation
one
of
the
first
names
i
uttered
was
naturally
that
of
vivian
cried
out
the
poor
old
woman
a
blessing
on
her
the
good
lady
for
she
is
as
good
as
she
is
beautiful
without
her
protection
my
good
man
who
works
at
woodcutting
would
have
fallen
like
a
wolf
beneath
the
keepers
guns
and
she
began
to
narrate
to
me
how
her
husband
something
of
a
poacher
like
all
the
woodcutters
of
these
districts
had
one
night
gone
to
watch
for
a
roebuck
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
and
had
been
caught
by
a
party
of
keepers
he
sought
to
fly
the
keepers
fired
a
bullet
hit
him
in
the
thigh
he
fell
and
was
making
ready
to
let
himself
be
killed
on
the
spot
rather
than
surrender
when
there
suddenly
interposed
between
him
and
his
assailants
a
kind
of
very
thick
mist
which
covered
everything
the
ground
the
trees
the
keepers
and
the
wounded
man
himself
and
he
heard
a
voice
coming
out
of
the
mist
a
voice
gentle
like
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
murmuring
in
his
ear
thyself
my
son
the
spirit
of
vivian
will
watch
over
thee
till
thou
hast
crawled
out
of
the
forest
were
the
actual
words
of
the
fairy
concluded
the
and
she
crossed
herself
devoutly
for
pious
brittany
as
you
know
reveres
fairies
as
much
as
saints
i
do
not
know
if
mischievous
spirits
should
be
included
in
the
fairy
world
but
what
is
certain
is
that
this
charming
and
roguish
tribe
has
always
abounded
in
our
country
i
have
been
told
that
formerly
every
house
had
its
own
it
the
was
something
like
the
little
roman
household
god
now
visible
now
invisible
it
presided
over
all
the
acts
of
domestic
life
nay
more
it
shared
in
them
and
in
the
most
effective
manner
inside
the
house
it
helped
the
servants
blew
up
the
fire
on
the
hearth
supervised
the
cooking
of
the
food
for
men
or
beasts
quieted
the
crying
of
the
babe
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
cupboard
and
prevented
worms
from
settling
in
the
pieces
of
bacon
hanging
from
the
beams
similarly
there
fell
within
its
sphere
the
management
of
the
byres
and
stables
thanks
to
it
the
cows
gave
milk
abounding
in
butter
and
the
horses
had
round
croups
and
shining
coats
it
was
in
a
word
the
good
genius
of
the
house
but
conditionally
on
every
one
paying
to
it
the
respect
to
which
it
had
the
right
if
neglected
ever
so
little
its
kindness
changed
into
spite
and
there
was
no
unkind
trick
of
which
it
was
not
capable
towards
people
who
had
offended
it
such
as
upsetting
the
contents
of
the
pots
on
the
hearth
entangling
wool
round
distaffs
making
tobacco
unsmokeable
mixing
a
horse
mane
in
inextricable
confusion
drying
up
the
udders
of
cows
or
stripping
the
backs
of
sheep
therefore
care
was
taken
not
to
annoy
it
careful
attention
was
paid
to
all
its
habits
and
humours
thus
in
my
parents
house
our
old
maid
filie
never
lifted
the
trivet
from
the
fire
without
taking
the
precaution
of
sprinkling
it
with
water
to
cool
it
before
putting
it
away
at
the
corner
of
the
hearth
if
you
asked
her
the
reason
for
this
ceremony
she
would
reply
to
you
prevent
the
burning
himself
there
if
presently
he
sat
on
it
further
i
suppose
there
should
be
included
in
the
class
of
male
fairies
that
that
mysterious
night
shepherd
whose
tall
and
alarming
outline
the
rural
bretons
see
rising
in
the
twilight
if
by
chance
they
happen
to
return
late
from
i
have
never
been
able
to
obtain
exact
information
about
the
kind
of
herd
which
he
fed
nor
about
what
was
foreboded
by
the
meeting
with
him
most
often
such
a
meeting
is
dreaded
yet
as
one
of
my
female
informants
lise
bellec
reasonably
pointed
out
if
it
is
preferable
to
avoid
the
it
does
not
from
that
follow
that
he
is
a
harmful
spirit
according
to
her
he
would
rather
fulfil
a
beneficial
office
in
warning
human
beings
by
his
coming
that
night
is
not
made
for
lingering
in
the
fields
or
on
the
roads
but
for
shutting
oneself
in
behind
closed
doors
and
going
to
sleep
this
shepherd
of
the
shades
would
then
be
take
it
altogether
a
kind
of
good
shepherd
it
is
to
ensure
our
rest
and
safety
to
withdraw
us
from
excesses
of
toil
and
the
snares
of
night
that
he
compels
us
thoughtless
sheep
to
return
quickly
to
the
fold
no
doubt
it
is
an
almost
similar
protecting
office
which
in
popular
belief
has
fallen
to
another
male
fairy
more
particularly
attached
to
the
seashore
as
his
name
indicates
there
is
not
along
all
the
coast
of
brittany
or
as
it
is
called
in
all
the
a
single
district
where
the
existence
of
this
of
the
dunes
is
not
looked
on
as
a
real
fact
fully
proved
and
undeniable
changing
forms
and
different
aspects
are
attributed
to
him
sometimes
he
is
a
giant
sometimes
a
dwarf
sometimes
he
wears
a
seaman
hat
of
oiled
cloth
sometimes
a
broad
black
felt
hat
at
times
he
leans
on
an
oar
and
recalls
the
enigmatic
personage
possessed
of
the
same
attribute
whom
ulysses
has
to
follow
in
the
but
he
is
always
a
marine
hero
whose
office
it
is
to
traverse
the
shores
uttering
at
intervals
long
piercing
cries
calculated
to
frighten
away
fishermen
who
may
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
surprised
outside
by
the
darkness
of
night
he
only
hurts
those
who
resist
and
even
then
would
only
strike
them
in
their
own
interest
to
force
them
to
seek
shelter
he
is
before
all
one
who
warns
his
cries
not
only
call
back
home
people
out
late
on
the
sands
they
also
inform
sailors
at
sea
of
the
dangerous
proximity
of
the
shore
and
thereby
make
up
for
the
insufficiency
of
the
hooting
of
sirens
or
of
the
light
of
lighthouses
we
may
remark
in
this
connexion
that
a
parallel
feature
is
observed
in
the
legend
of
the
old
armorican
saints
who
were
mostly
emigrants
from
ireland
one
of
their
usual
exercises
consisted
in
parading
throughout
the
night
the
coasts
where
they
had
set
up
their
oratories
shaking
little
bells
of
wrought
iron
the
ringing
of
which
like
the
cries
of
was
intended
to
warn
voyagers
that
land
was
near
i
am
persuaded
that
the
worship
of
saints
which
is
the
first
and
most
fervent
of
breton
religious
observances
preserves
many
of
the
features
of
a
more
ancient
religion
in
which
a
belief
in
fairies
held
the
chief
place
the
same
i
feel
sure
applies
to
those
which
i
have
collected
under
the
name
of
the
legend
of
the
dead
among
the
armorican
bretons
in
truth
in
the
breton
mind
the
dead
are
not
dead
they
live
a
mysterious
life
on
the
edge
of
real
life
but
their
world
remains
fully
mingled
with
ours
and
as
soon
as
night
falls
as
soon
as
the
living
properly
so
called
give
themselves
up
to
the
temporary
sleep
of
death
the
dead
again
become
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
which
they
have
never
left
they
resume
their
place
at
their
former
hearth
devote
themselves
to
their
old
work
take
an
interest
in
the
home
the
fields
the
boat
they
behave
in
a
word
like
the
race
of
male
and
female
fairies
which
once
formed
a
more
refined
and
delicate
species
of
humanity
in
the
midst
of
ordinary
humanity
i
might
my
dear
wentz
evoke
many
other
types
from
this
intermediate
world
of
breton
faerie
which
in
my
countrymen
mind
is
not
identical
with
this
world
nor
with
the
other
but
shares
at
once
in
both
through
a
curious
mixture
of
the
natural
and
supernatural
i
have
only
intended
in
these
hasty
lines
to
show
the
wealth
of
material
to
which
you
have
with
so
much
conscientiousness
and
ardour
devoted
your
efforts
and
now
may
the
fairies
be
propitious
to
you
my
dear
friend
they
will
do
nothing
but
justice
in
favouring
with
all
their
goodwill
the
young
and
brilliant
writer
who
has
but
now
revived
their
cult
by
renewing
their
glory
rennes
breton
fairies
or
in
lower
brittany
which
is
the
genuinely
celtic
part
of
armorica
instead
of
finding
a
widespread
in
fairies
of
the
kind
existing
in
wales
ireland
and
scotland
we
find
a
widespread
in
the
existence
of
the
dead
and
to
a
less
extent
in
that
of
the
tribes
for
our
psychological
theory
this
is
very
significant
it
seems
to
indicate
that
among
the
bretons
who
are
one
of
the
most
conservative
celtic
peoples
the
finds
its
chief
expression
in
a
belief
that
men
live
after
death
in
an
invisible
world
just
as
in
ireland
the
dead
and
fairies
live
in
fairyland
this
opinion
was
first
suggested
to
me
by
professor
anatole
le
braz
author
of
légende
de
la
and
by
professor
georges
dottin
both
of
the
university
of
rennes
but
before
evidence
to
sustain
and
to
illustrate
this
opinion
is
offered
it
will
be
well
to
consider
the
less
important
breton
or
beings
like
them
and
then
and
dwarfs
luzel
who
collected
so
many
of
the
popular
stories
in
brittany
found
that
what
few
or
fairies
there
are
almost
always
appear
in
as
little
old
women
or
as
the
breton
usually
calls
them
i
have
selected
and
abridged
the
following
legendary
tale
from
his
works
to
illustrate
the
nature
of
these
breton
in
ancient
times
as
we
read
in
princesse
a
rich
nobleman
had
three
sons
the
oldest
was
called
cado
the
second
méliau
and
the
youngest
yvon
one
day
as
they
were
together
in
a
forest
with
their
bows
and
arrows
they
met
a
little
old
woman
whom
they
had
never
seen
before
and
she
was
carrying
on
her
head
a
jar
of
water
you
able
lads
cado
asked
his
two
brothers
break
with
an
arrow
the
jar
of
the
little
old
woman
without
touching
her
do
not
wish
to
try
it
they
said
fearing
to
injure
the
good
woman
right
i
do
it
then
watch
me
and
cado
took
his
bow
and
let
fly
an
arrow
the
arrow
went
straight
to
its
mark
and
split
the
jar
without
touching
the
little
old
woman
but
the
water
wet
her
to
the
skin
and
in
anger
she
said
to
the
skilful
archer
have
failed
cado
and
i
will
be
revenged
on
you
for
this
from
now
until
you
have
found
the
princess
blondine
all
the
members
of
your
body
will
tremble
as
leaves
on
a
tree
tremble
when
the
north
wind
blows
and
instantly
cado
was
seized
by
a
trembling
malady
in
all
his
body
the
three
brothers
returned
home
and
told
their
father
what
had
happened
and
the
father
turning
to
cado
said
my
unfortunate
son
you
have
failed
it
is
now
necessary
for
you
to
travel
until
you
find
the
princess
blondine
as
the
said
for
that
little
old
woman
was
a
and
no
doctor
in
the
world
can
cure
the
malady
she
has
put
upon
you
of
lower
throughout
the
morbihan
and
finistère
i
found
that
stories
about
are
much
less
common
than
about
and
in
some
localities
extremely
rare
but
the
ones
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
collect
are
much
the
same
in
character
as
those
gathered
in
the
by
luzel
and
elsewhere
by
other
collectors
those
i
here
record
were
told
to
me
at
carnac
during
the
summer
of
the
first
one
by
yvonne
daniel
a
native
of
the
île
de
croix
off
the
coast
of
carnac
and
the
others
by
goulven
le
scour
little
île
de
croix
was
especially
famous
for
its
old
and
the
following
legend
is
still
believed
by
its
oldest
inhabitants
an
aged
man
who
had
suffered
long
from
leprosy
was
certain
to
die
within
a
short
time
when
a
woman
bent
double
with
age
entered
his
house
she
asked
from
what
malady
he
suffered
and
on
being
informed
began
to
say
prayers
then
she
breathed
upon
the
sores
of
the
leper
and
almost
suddenly
disappeared
the
had
cured
him
is
certain
that
about
fifty
years
ago
the
people
in
finistère
still
believed
in
it
was
thought
that
the
were
spirits
who
came
to
predict
some
unexpected
event
in
the
family
they
came
especially
to
console
orphans
who
had
very
unkind
in
their
youth
tanguy
du
chatel
and
his
sister
eudes
were
protected
by
a
against
the
misfortune
which
pursued
them
the
history
of
brittany
says
so
in
léon
it
is
said
that
the
served
to
guide
unfortunate
people
consoling
them
with
the
promise
of
a
happy
and
victorious
future
in
the
cornouailles
on
the
contrary
it
is
said
that
the
were
very
evilly
disposed
that
they
were
demons
grandmother
marie
le
bras
had
related
to
me
that
one
evening
an
old
arrived
in
my
village
kerouledic
finistère
and
asked
for
hospitality
it
was
about
the
year
the
was
received
and
before
going
to
bed
she
predicted
that
the
little
daughter
whom
the
mother
was
dressing
in
would
be
found
dead
in
the
cradle
the
next
day
this
prediction
was
only
laughed
at
but
in
the
morning
the
little
one
was
dead
in
her
cradle
her
eyes
raised
toward
heaven
the
who
had
slept
in
the
stable
was
gone
in
these
last
three
accounts
by
le
scour
we
observe
three
quite
different
ideas
concerning
the
breton
fairies
or
in
finistère
and
in
léon
the
are
regarded
as
good
protecting
spirits
almost
like
ancestral
spirits
which
originally
they
may
have
been
in
the
cornouailles
they
are
evil
spirits
while
in
the
third
account
about
the
old
and
in
the
legend
of
the
leper
cured
by
a
the
are
rationalized
as
in
luzel
tale
quoted
above
into
sorceresses
or
changed
by
goulven
le
scour
at
my
request
wrote
down
in
french
the
following
account
of
actual
changelings
in
finistère
remember
very
well
that
there
was
a
woman
of
the
village
of
kergoff
in
plouneventer
who
was
called
the
mother
of
a
family
when
she
had
her

was
no
longer
the
fine
baby
she
had
put

evening
there
was
instead
an
infant
hideous
to
look
at
greatly
deformed
hunchbacked
and
crooked
and
of
a

colour
the
poor
woman
knew
that

night
and
had
changed
her
child

still
lives
and
he
is
about
seventy
years
old
he
has
all
the
possible
vices
and
he
has
tried
many
times
to
kill
his
mother
he
is
a
veritable
demon
he
often
predicts
the
future
and
has
a
habit
of
running
abroad
during
the
night
they
call
him
the
little
and
everybody
flees
from
him
being
poor
and
infirm
now
he
has
been
obliged
to
beg
and
people
give
him
alms
because
they
have
great
fear
of
him
his
is
olier
woman
had
a
second
then
a
third
child
both
of
whom
were
seen
by
everybody
to
have
been
born
with
no
infirmity
and
in
turn
each
of
these
two
was
stolen
by
a
and
replaced
by
a
little
hunchback
the
second
child
was
a
most
beautiful
daughter
she
was
during
the
night
and
replaced
by
a
little
girl
babe
so
deformed
that
it
resembled
a
ball
if
her
brother
olier
was
bad
she
was
even
worse
she
was
the
terror
of
the
village
and
they
called
her
anniac
the
third
child
met
the
same
luck
but
was
not
so
bad
as
the
first
and
second
poor
mother
greatly
worried
at
seeing
what
had
happened
related
her
troubles
to
another
woman
this
woman
said
to
her
if
you
have
another
child
place
with
it
in
the
cradle
a
little
sprig
of
which
has
been
blessed
by
a
priest
and
the
will
no
longer
have
the
power
of
stealing
your
children
and
when
a
fourth
child
was
born
to
the
unfortunate
woman
it
was
not
stolen
for
she
placed
in
the
cradle

in

that
the
who

to
make

it
is
equally
pretended
that
a

do
nothing

leaping

fleeing
from

guenolé
when
he
encountered

said
to

thereupon
gradlon

and

beautiful
castles

it
is
so
pleasant

that
mortals
going
there
find

no
longer
than
days
of

principally
in
upper
brittany
sébillot
found
rich
concerning
though
some
of
his
material
is
drawn
from
peasants
and
fishermen
who
are
not
so
purely
celtic
as
those
in
lower
brittany
and
he
very
concisely
summarizes
the
various
names
there
given
to
the
as
follows
are
generally
called
fairies
sometimes
fates
a
name
nearer
than
to
the
latin
fem
and

both
used
and
from
is
probably
derived
or
which
is
the
name
borne
by
the

the
husbands
or
the
children
of
the
near
they
are
sometimes
called
this
term
which
is
applied
to
both

seems
also
to
designate
the
mischievous
sprites
round
the
mené
in
the
cantons
of
collinée
and
of
moncontour
they
are
called
la
or
my
godmother
or
even
the
good
woman
on
the
coast
they
are
often
enough
called
by
the
name
of
good
ladies
or
of
bonnes

our
good
mothers
the
fairies
usually
they
are
spoken
of
with
a
certain
respect
as
the
same
authority
suggests
probably
the
most
characteristic
in
upper
brittany
are
the
des
fairies
of
the
billows
and
traditions
say
that
they
lived
in
natural
caverns
or
grottoes
in
the
they
form
a
distinct
class
of
unknown
elsewhere
in

them
as
greatly
rationalized
associated
with
them
are
the
a
race
of
dwarfs

swords
no
bigger
than
pins
a
pretty
legend
about
magic
buckwheat
cakes
which
in
different
forms
is
widespread
throughout
all
brittany
is
told
of
these
little
fairies
like
the
larger
the
kept
cattle
and
one
day
a
black
cow
belonging
to
the
of
ate
the
buckwheat
in
the
field
of
a
woman
of
that
neighbourhood
the
woman
went
to
the
to
complain
and
in
reply
to
her
a
voice
said
your
tongue
you
will
be
paid
for
your
buckwheat
thereupon
the
gave
the
woman
a
cupful
of
buckwheat
and
promised
her
that
it
would
never
diminish
so
long
as
none
should
be
given
away
that
year
buckwheat
was
very
scarce
but
no
matter
how
many
buckwheat
cakes
the
woman
and
her
family
ate
there
was
never
diminution
in
the
amount
of
the
fairy
buckwheat
at
last
however
the
unfortunate
hour
came
a
arrived
and
asked
for
food
thoughtlessly
the
woman
gave
him
one
of
her
buckwheat
cakes
and
suddenly
as
though
by
magic
all
the
rest
of
the
buckwheat
disappeared
for
ever
along
the
rance
the
inhabitants
tell
about
who
appear
during
storms
these
are
dressed
in
the
colours
of

pass
along
following
a
most
beautiful
who

from
a
nautilus
of
the
southern
seas

the
boat

place

similar
said
to
exist
in
upper
brittany
as
in
lower
brittany
the
generally
had
their
abodes
in
tumuli
in
dolmens
in
forests
in
waste
lands
where
there
are
great
rocks
or
about
menhirs
and
many
other
kinds
of
spirits
lived
in
the
sea
and
troubled
sailors
and
like
all
of
celtic
countries
those
of
upper
brittany
were
given
to
stealing
children
thus
at
dinard
not
long
ago
there
was
a
woman
more
than
thirty
years
old
who
was
no
bigger
than
a
girl
of
ten
and
it
was
said
she
was
a
fairy
changeling
in
lower
brittany
the
of
children
was
often
attributed
to
dwarfs
rather
than
to
though
the
method
of
making
the
changeling
speak
is
the
same
as
in
upper
brittany
namely
to
place
in
such
a
manner
before
an
open
fire
a
number
of
eggshells
filled
with
water
that
they
appear
to
the
changeling
who
is
placed
where
he
can
well
observe
all
the
proceedings
like
so
many
small
pots
of
cooking
food
whereupon
being
greatly
astonished
at
the
unusual
sight
he
forgets
himself
and
speaks
for
the
first
time
thus
betraying
his
demon
nature
the
following
midwife
story
as
told
by
comault
of
gouray
in
is
quite
a
parallel
to
the
one
we
have
recorded
on
as
coming
from
grange
ireland
a
midwife
who
delivered
a
la
carelessly
allowed
some
of
the
fairy
ointment
to
get
on
one
of
her
own
eyes
the
eye
at
once
became
clairvoyant
so
that
she
beheld
the
in
their
true
nature
and
quite
like
a
midwife
in
a
similar
story
about
the
des
this
midwife
happened
to
see
a
in
the
act
of
stealing
and
spoke
to
her
thereupon
the
asked
the
midwife
with
which
eye
she
beheld
her
and
when
the
midwife
indicated
which
one
it
was
the
pulled
it
out
generally
like
their
relatives
in
insular
celtdom
the
fairies
of
upper
brittany
could
assume
various
forms
and
could
even
transform
the
human
body
and
they
were
given
to
playing
tricks
on
mortals
and
always
to
taking
revenge
on
them
if
in
most
ways
they
were
like
other
races
of
fairies
celtic
and
though
very
much
anthropomorphosed
in
their
nature
by
the
peasant
and
mariner
as
a
rule
the
of
upper
brittany
are
described
in
legend
as
young
and
very
beautiful
some
however
appear
to
be
centuries
old
with
teeth
as
long
as
a
human
hand
and
with
backs
covered
with
seaweeds
and
mussels
or
other
marine
growths
as
an
indication
of
their
great
age
at
they
are
said
to
be
dressed
like
the
at
carnac
see
in
a
kind
of
heavy
linen
cloth
on
the
of
upper
brittany
the
popular
opinion
is
that
the
are
a
fallen
race
condemned
to
an
earthly
exile
for
a
certain
period
in
the
region
of
the
mené
canton
of
collinée
the
old
folk
say
that
after
the
angels
revolted
those
left
in
paradise
were
divided
into
two
parts
those
who
fought
on
the
side
of
god
and
those
who
remained
neutral
these
last
already
were
sent
to
the
earth
for
a
time
and
became
the
the
general
belief
in
the
interior
of
brittany
is
that
the
once
existed
but
that
they
disappeared
as
their
country
was
changed
by
modern
conditions
in
the
region
of
the
mené
and
of
ercé
it
is
said
that
for
more
than
a
century
there
have
been
no
and
on
the
where
it
is
still
firmly
believed
that
the
used
to
live
in
the
billows
or
amid
certain
grottoes
in
the
cliffs
against
which
the
billows
broke
the
opinion
is
that
they
disappeared
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
the
oldest
bretons
say
that
their
parents
or
grandparents
often
spoke
about
having
seen
but
very
rarely
do
they
say
that
they
themselves
have
seen

it
is
the
race
however
which
more
than
or

forms
a
large
part
of
the
invisible
inhabitants
of
brittany
and
this
race
of
and
dwarfs
may
be
made
to
include
many
kinds
of
or
as
they
are
often
called
by
the
peasant
or
playful
elves
though
the
peasants
both
in
upper
and
in
lower
brittany
may
have
no
strong
faith
in
most
of
them
say
that
or
and
mischievous
spirits
still
exist
but
in
a
few
localities
as
sébillot
discovered
there
is
an
opinion
that
the
departed
with
the
and
with
them
will
return
in
this
century
because
during
each
century
with
an
odd
number
like
the
fairy
tribes
of
all
kinds
are
said
to
be
visible
or
to
reappear
among
men
and
to
become
invisible
or
to
disappear
during
each
century
with
an
even
number
like
so
this
is
the
visible
century
and
only
show
themselves
at
night
or
in
the
twilight
no
one
knows
where
they
pass
the
some
or
after
the
manner
of
scotch
kelpies
live
solitary
lives
in
lakes
or
ponds
whereas
are
socially
united
in
groups
or
families
and
amuse
themselves
by
playing
tricks
on
travellers

by
after
dark
souvestre
records
a
story
showing
how
the
can
assume
any
animal
form
but
that
their
natural
form
is
that
of
a
little
man
dressed
in
green
and
that
the
have
declared
war
on
them
for
being
too
friendly
to
men
from
what
follows
about
by
goulven
le
scour
they
show
affinity
with
pucks
and
such
hobgoblins
as
are
found
in
wales
were
little
dwarfs
who
generally
appeared
at
to
attack
belated
travellers
and
it
is
related
in
breton
legends
that
these
sometimes
transformed
themselves
into
black
horses
or
into
goats
and
whoever
then
had
the
misfortune
to
encounter
them
sometimes
found
his
life
in
danger
and
was
always
seized
with
great
terror
but
generally
what
the
breton
peasant
tells
about
he
is
apt
to
tell
at
another
time
about
and
both
tribes
of
beings
so
far
as
they
can
be
distinguished
are
the
same
as
the
elfish
peoples
pixies
in

robin
in

goblins
in

brownies
in
scotland

some
carry
a

some

nearly
all
of
them
are
mischievous

an
article
in
the
des
traditions
sébillot
has
classified
more
than
fifty
names
given
to
and
in
lower
brittany
according
to
the
form
under
which
these
spirits
appear
their
peculiar
traits
and
the
country
they
inhabit
like
the
fairies
in
britain
and
ireland
the
and
the
cornish
pixies
find
their
favourite
amusement
in
the
circular
dance
when
the
moon
is
clear
and
bright
they
gather
for
their
frolic
near
menhirs
and
dolmens
and
tumuli
and
at
or
even
in
the
open
country
and
they
never
miss
an
opportunity
of
enticing
a
mortal
passing
by
to
join
them
if
he
happens
to
be
a
man
and
enters
their
sport
heartily
they
treat
him
quite
as
a
companion
and
may
even
do
him
some
good
turn
but
if
he
is
not
agreeable
they
will
make
him
dance
until
he
falls
down
exhausted
and
should
he
commit
some
act
thoroughly
displeasing
to
them
he
will
meet
their
certain
revenge
according
to
a
story
reported
from
lorient
morbihan
it
is
taboo
for
the

make
a
complete
enumeration
of
the

his

stupefied
and
distressed
attempted
in
vain
to
knock
in
his
hump
with
blows
of
their
fists
at
how
the
tradition
of
the
dancing
and
their
weekday
song
still
lives
appears
from
the
following
accounts
which
i
found
at
and
near
carnac
the
first
account
having
been
given
during
january
by
madame
marie
ezanno
of
carnac
then
years
old
are
little
dwarfs
who
formerly
by
moonlight
used
to
dance
in
a
circle
on
the
prairies
they
sang
a
song
the
couplet
of
which
was
not
understood
but
only
the
refrain
translated
in
breton
monday
tuesday
wednesday
whistled
in
order
to
assemble
where
they
danced
mushrooms
grew
and
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
silence
so
as
not
to
interrupt
them
in
their
dance
they
were
often
very
brutal
towards
a
man
who
fell
under
their
power
and
if
they
had
a
grudge
against
him
they
would
make
him
submit
to
the
greatest
tortures
the
peasants
believed
strongly
in
the
because
they
thus
saw
them
and
heard
them
the
dressed
in
very
coarse
white
linen
cloth
they
were
mischievous
spirits
who
lived
under
dolmens
one
morning
lemort
and
myself
called
upon
madame
louise
le
rouzic
in
her
neat
home
at
kerallan
a
little
group
of
thatched
cottages
about
a
mile
from
carnac
as
we
entered
madame
le
rouzic
herself
was
sitting
on
a
long
wooden
bench
by
the
window
knitting
and
her
daughter
was
watching
the
dinner
as
it
boiled
in
great
iron
pots
hanging
from
chains
over
a
brilliant
fire
on
the
hearth
large
gleaming
brass
basins
were
ranged
on
a
shelf
above
the
broad
open
wherein
the
fire
burned
and
massive
bedsteads
carved
after
the
breton
style
stood
on
the
stone
floor
when
many
things
had
been
talked
about
our
conversation
turned
to
and
then
the
good
woman
of
the
house
told
us
these
tales
at
former
times
a
young
girl
having
taken
the
keys
of
the
church
presumably
at
carnac
and
having
entered
it
found
the
about
to
dance
and
the
were
singing
monday
tuesday
on
seeing
the
young
girl
they
stopped
surrounded
her
and
invited
her
to
dance
with
them
she
accepted
and
in
singing
added
to
their
song
wednesday
in
amazement
the
cried
joyfully
she
has
added
something
to
our
song
what
shall
we
give
her
as
recompense
and
they
gave
her
a
bracelet
a
friend
of
hers
meeting
her
asked
where
the
fine
bracelet
came
from
and
the
young
girl
told
what
had
happened
the
second
girl
hurried
to
the
church
and
found
the
still
dancing
the
she
joined
their
dance
and
in
singing
added
thursday
to
their
song
but
that
broke
the
cadence
and
the
in
fury
instead
of
recompensing
her
wished
to
punish
her
what
shall
we
do
to
her
one
of
them
cried
let
the
day
be
as
night
to
her
the
others
replied
and
by
day
wherever
she
went
she
saw
only
the
night
my
grandfather
lived
continued
madame
le
rouzic
was
a
young
girl
who
went
to
the
sabbath
of
the
and
when
she
returned
and
was
asked
where
she
had
been
said
i
have
travelled
over
water
wood
and
hedges
and
she
related
all
she
had
seen
and
heard
then
one
night
afterwards
the
came
into
the
house
beat
her
and
dragged
her
from
bed
upon
hearing
the
uproar
my
grandfather
arose
and
found
the
girl
lying
flat
on
the
stone
floor
never
question
me
again
she
said
to
him
or
they
will
kill
me
as
some
breton
legends
give
the
chief
characteristics
of
fairies
in
celtic
britain
and
ireland
and
villemarqué
in
his
pp
makes
the
breton
word
synonymous
with
or
fairy
thus
seigneur

et
la
fée
aotrou
nann

ar
corrigan
in
this
legend
the
seems
clearly
enough
to
be
a
was
seated
at
the
edge
of
her
fountain
and
she
was
combing
her
long
fair
hair
but
unlike
most
the
lives
in
a
grotto
which
according
to
villemarqué
is
one
of
those
ancient
monuments
called
in
breton
or
ar
in
french
de
or
aux
like
the
famous
one
near
rennes
the
fountain
where
the
was
seated
seems
to
be
one
of
those
sacred
fountains
which
as
villemarqué
says
are
often
found
near
a
aux
and
called
de
la
or
in
breton
ar
in
another
of
villemarqué
legends
after
the
test
has
been
used
and
the
little
is
replaced
by
the
real
child
the
latter
as
though
all
the
while
it
had
been
in
an
unconscious
which
has
a
curious
bearing
on
our
psychological
theory
stretches
forth
its
arms
and
awakening
exclaims
mother
what
a
long
time
i
have
been
asleep
and
in
we
see
the
little
or
dwarfs
inhabiting
a
cave
and
guarding
treasures
in
his
introduction
to
the
villemarqué
describes
whom
he
equates
with
as
very
similar
to
ordinary
fairies
they
can
foretell
the
future
they
know
the
art
of
war
quite
like
the
irish
or
tuatha
de
danann
they
can
assume
any
animal
form
and
are
able
to
travel
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
another
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
love
feasting
and
music
like
all
celtic
and
dance
in
a
circle
holding
hands
but
at
the
least
noise
disappear
their
favourite
haunts
are
near
fountains
and
dolmens
they
are
little
beings
not
more
than
two
feet
high
and
beautifully
proportioned
with
bodies
as
aerial
and
transparent
as
those
of
wasps
and
like
all
fairy
or
elvish
races
and
like
the
breton
or
they
are
given
to
stealing
the
children
of
mortals
professor
loth
has
called
my
attention
to
an
unpublished
breton
legend
of
his
collection
in
which
there
are
beings
comparable
to
these
described
by
villemarqué
and
he
tells
me
too
that
throughout
brittany
one
finds
the
counterpart
of
the
welsh
or
family
and
that
both
in
wales
and
brittany
the
are
popularly
described
as
little
women
or
maidens
like
fairies
no
larger
than
children
and
where
villemarqué
draws
a
clear
distinction
is
between
these
and
on
the
one
hand
and
the
or
dwarfs
on
the
other
these
last
are
what
we
have
found
associated
or
identified
with
in
the
morbihan
villemarqué
describes
the
as
a
hideous
race
of
beings
with
dark
or
even
black
hairy
bodies
with
voices
like
old
men
and
with
little
sparkling
black
eyes
they
are
fond
of
playing
tricks
on
mortals
who
fall
into
their
power
and
are
given
to
singing
in
a
circular
dance
the
weekday
song
very
often
regarded
as
equally
with
all
kinds
of
are
believed
to
be
evil
spirits
or
demons
condemned
to
live
here
on
earth
in
a
penitential
state
for
an
indefinite
time
and
sometimes
they
seem
not
much
different
from
what
irish
celts
when
talking
of
fairies
call
fallen
angels
nain
de
translated
from
breton
by
professor
loth
in
part
illustrates
this
upon
seeing
water
boiling
in
a
number
of
ranged
before
an
open
fire
a
is
so
greatly
astonished
that
he
unwittingly
speaks
for
the
first
time
and
says
i
am
almost
one
hundred
years
old
and
never
such
a
thing
have
i
yet
seen
son
of
satan
then
cries
out
the
mother
as
she
comes
from
her
place
of
hiding
and
beats
the
who
thus
by
means
of
the
test
has
been
tricked
into
revealing
his
demon
nature
in
a
parallel
story
reported
by
villemarqué
in
his
a
is
equally
astonished
to
see
a
similar
row
of
boiling
before
an
open
fire
like
so
many
pots
of
food
and
gives
himself
away
through
the
following
remark
have
seen
the
acorn
before
the
oak
i
have
seen
the
egg
before
the
white
chicken
i
have
never
seen
the
equal
to
this
of
the
as
to
the
general
ideas
about
the
le
scour
says
the
were
the
terror
of
the
especially
in
finistère
in
the
morbihan
and
throughout
the
they
were
believed
to
be
souls
in
pain
condemned
to
wander
at
night
in
waste
lands
and
marshes
sometimes
they
were
seen
as
dwarfs
and
often
they
were
not
seen
at
all
but
were
heard
in
houses
making
an
infernal
noise
unlike
the
de
phantom
washerwomen
of
the
night
they
were
heard
only
in
summer
never
in
winter
the
breton
legend
of
the
dead
we
come
now
to
the
breton
legend
of
the
dead
common
generally
to
all
parts
of
armorica
though
probably
even
more
widespread
in
lower
brittany
than
in
upper
brittany
and
this
we
call
the
armorican
even
where
the
peasants
have
no
faith
in
or
fairies
and
where
their
faith
in
is
weak
or
almost
gone
there
is
a
strong
conviction
among
them
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
can
show
themselves
to
the
living
a
vigorous
belief
in
apparitions
and
various
as
professor
anatole
le
braz
has
so
well
said
in
his
introduction
to
légende
de
la
whole
conscience
of
these
people
is
fundamentally
directed
toward
that
which
concerns
death
and
the
ideas
which
they
form
of
it
in
spite
of
the
strong
christian
imprint
which
they
have
received
do
not
seem
much
different
from
those
which
we
have
pointed
out
among
their
pagan
ancestors
for
them
as
for
the
primitive
celts
death
is
less
a
change
of
condition
than
a
journey
a
departure
for
another
world
and
thus
it
seems
that
this
most
popular
of
the
breton
is
genuinely
celtic
and
extremely
ancient
as
renan
has
said
the
celtic
people
are
race
mysterious
having
knowledge
of
the
future
and
the
secret
of
death
and
whereas
in
ireland
unusual
happenings
or
strange
accidents
and
death
are
attributed
to
fairy
interference
in
brittany
they
are
attributed
to
the
influence
of
the
dead
the
breton
celt
makes
no
distinction
between
the
living
and
the
dead
all
alike
inhabit
this
world
the
one
being
visible
the
other
invisible
though
seers
can
at
all
times
behold
the
dead
on
november
eve
and
on
christmas
eve
they
are
most
numerous
and
most
easily
seen
and
no
peasant
would
think
of
questioning
their
existence
in
ireland
and
scotland
the
fear
to
speak
of
fairies
save
through
an
euphemism
and
the
bretons
speak
of
the
dead
indirectly
and
even
then
with
fear
and
trembling
the
following
legend
which
i
found
at
carnac
will
serve
to
illustrate
both
the
profundity
of
the
belief
in
the
power
of
the
dead
over
the
living
in
lower
brittany
and
how
deeply
the
people
can
be
stirred
by
the
predictions
of
one
who
can
see
the
dead
and
the
legend
is
quite
typical
of
those
so
common
in
armorica
there
was
a
woman
whom
spirits
impelled
to
rise
from
her
bed
it
made
no
difference
at
what
hour
of
the
night
in
order
to
behold
funerals
in
the
future
she
predicted
who
should
die
who
should
carry
the
corpse
who
the
cross
and
who
should
follow
the
her
predictions
frightened
every
one
and
made
her
such
a
terror
to
the
country
that
the
mayor
had
threatened
to
take
legal
proceedings
against
her
if
she
continued
her
practice
but
she
was
compelled
to
tell
the
things
which
the
spirits
showed
her
it
is
about
ten
years
since
this
woman
died
in
the
hospital
at
auray
of
a
breton
there
lives
in
the
little
hamlet
of
kerlois
less
than
a
mile
from
carnac
a
breton
seeress
a
woman
who
since
eight
years
of
age
has
been
privileged
to
behold
the
world
invisible
and
its
inhabitants
quite
like
the
woman
who
died
at
auray
she
is
madame
eugénie
le
port
now
years
old
and
what
she
tells
of
things
seen
in
this
invisible
world
which
surrounds
her
might
easily
be
taken
for
irish
legends
about
fairies
knowing
very
little
french
because
she
is
thoroughly
breton
madame
le
port
described
her
visions
in
her
own
native
tongue
and
her
eldest
daughter
acted
as
interpreter
i
had
known
the
good
woman
since
the
previous
winter
and
so
we
were
able
to
converse
familiarly
and
as
i
sat
in
her
own
little
cottage
in
company
with
her
husband
and
daughters
and
with
lemort
who
acted
as
recording
secretary
this
is
what
she
said
in
her
clear
earnest
manner
in
answer
to
my
questions
believe
that
the
spirits
of
our
ancestors
surround
us
and
live
with
us
one
day
on
a
road
from
carnac
i
encountered
a
woman
of
kergoellec
who
had
been
dead
eight
days
i
asked
her
to
move
to
one
side
so
that
i
could
pass
and
she
vanished
this
was
eleven
in
the
morning
i
saw
her
at
another
time
in
the
marsh
of
breno
i
spoke
but
she
did
not
reply
on
the
route
from
plouharnel
near
carnac
i
saw
in
the
the
funeral
of
a
woman
who
did
not
die
until
fifteen
days
afterwards
i
recognized
perfectly
all
the
people
who
took
part
in
it
but
the
person
with
me
saw
nothing
another
time
near
three
in
the
afternoon
and
eight
days
before
her
death
i
saw
upon
the
same
route
the
funeral
of
a
woman
who
was
drowned
and
i
have
seen
a
phantom
horse
going
to
the
sabbath
and
as
if
forced
along
against
its
will
for
it
reared
and
pawed
the
earth
when
pierre
rouzic
of
kerlois
died
i
saw
a
light
of
all
colours
between
heaven
and
earth
the
very
night
of
his
death
i
have
seen
a
woman
asleep
whose
spirit
must
have
been
free
for
i
saw
it
hovering
outside
her
body
she
was
not
awakened
at
the
time
for
fear
that
the
spirit
would
not
find
its
body
again
in
answer
to
my
question
as
to
how
long
these
various
visions
usually
lasted
madame
le
port
said
lasted
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
less
and
all
of
them
disappeared
instantaneously
as
madame
le
port
now
seemed
unable
to
recall
more
of
her
visions
i
finally
asked
her
what
she
thought
about
and
she
replied
believe
they
exist
as
some
special
kind
of
spirits
though
i
have
never
seen
any
that
the
dead
this
is
what
jean
couton
an
old
breton
told
me
at
carnac
am
only
an
old
peasant
without
instruction
without
any
education
but
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
concerning
the
dead
following
my
own
idea
i
believe
that
after
death
the
soul
always
exists
and
travels
among
us
i
repeat
to
you
that
i
have
belief
that
the
dead
are
seen
i
am
now
going
to
prove
this
to
you
in
the
following
story
winter
evening
i
was
returning
home
from
a
funeral
i
had
as
companion
a
kinswoman
of
the
man
just
buried
we
took
the
train
and
soon
alighted
in
the
station
of
plouharnel
we
still
had
three
kilometres
to
go
before
reaching
home
and
as
it
was
winter
and
at
that
epoch
there
was
no
we
were
obliged
to
travel
afoot
as
we
were
going
along
suddenly
there
appeared
to
my
companion
her
dead
relative
whom
we
had
buried
that
day
she
asked
me
if
i
saw
anything
and
since
i
replied
to
her
negatively
she
said
to
me
touch
me
and
you
will
see
without
doubt
i
touched
her
and
i
saw
the
same
as
she
did
the
person
just
dead
whom
i
clearly
recognized
concerning
a
very
popular
breton
belief
in
phantom
washerwomen

in

the
following
summary

were
heard
less
often
than
the
but
were
much
more
feared
it
was
usually
towards
midnight
that
they
were
heard
beating
their
linen
in
front
of
different
always
some
way
from
the
villages
according
to
the
old
folk
of
the
past
generation
when
the
phantom
washerwomen
would
ask
a
certain
to
help
them
to
wring
sheets
he
could
not
refuse
under
pain
of
being
stopped
and
wrung
like
a
sheet
himself
and
it
was
necessary
for
those
who
aided
in
wringing
the
sheets
to
turn
in
the
same
direction
as
the
washerwomen
for
if
by
misfortune
the
assistant
turned
in
an
opposite
direction
he
had
his
arms
wrung
in
an
instant
it
is
believed
that
these
phantom
washerwomen
are
women
condemned
to
wash
their
mortuary
sheets
during
whole
centuries
but
that
when
they
find
some
mortal
to
wring
in
an
opposite
direction
they
are
delivered

le
rouzic
a
breton
celt
who
has
spent
most
of
his
life
studying
the
archaeology
and
of
the
morbihan
and
who
is
at
present
keeper
of
the
miln
museum
at
carnac
summarizes
for
us
the
state
of
popular
beliefs
as
he
finds
them
existing
in
the
carnac
country
now
are
few
traditions
concerning
the
in
the
region
of
carnac
but
the
belief
in
spirits
good
and
bad
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
as
the
belief
in
is
general
and
profound
as
well
as
the
belief
in
the
incarnation
of
spirits
and
i
am
convinced
that
these
beliefs
are
the
reminiscences
of
ancient
celtic
beliefs
held
by
the
druids
and
conserved
by
christianity
in
finistère
as
purely
breton
as
the
morbihan
i
found
the
legend
of
the
dead
just
as
widespread
and
the
belief
in
spirits
and
the
apparitional
return
of
the
dead
quite
as
profound
but
nothing
worth
recording
concerning
fairies
the
stories
which
follow
were
told
to
me
by
pierre
vichon
a
pure
breton
celt
born
at
lescoff
near
the
pointe
du
raz
finistère
in
peter
is
a
genuine
old
having
made
the
tour
of
the
globe
and
yet
he
has
not
lost
the
innate
faith
of
his
ancient
ancestors
in
a
world
invisible
for
though
he
says
he
can
not
believe
all
that
the
people
in
his
part
of
finistère
tell
about
spirits
and
ghosts
he
must
have
a
belief
that
the
dead
as
spirits
exist
and
influence
the
living
because
of
his
own
personal
experience
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
its
kind
peter
speaks
breton
french
and
english
fluently
and
since
he
had
an
opportunity
for
the
first
time
in
seventeen
months
of
using
english
he
told
me
the
stories
in
my
own
native
language
vichon
strange
forty
years
ago
a
strange
thing
happened
in
my
life
a
relative
of
mine
had
taken
service
in
the
austrian
army
for
by
profession
he
was
a
soldier
though
at
first
he
had
begun
to
study
for
the
priesthood
during
the
progress
of
the
war
i
had
no
news
from
him
and
then
one
day
while
i
was
on
the
deck
of
a
norwegian
ship
just
off
dover
england
my
fellow
sailors
heard
a
noise
as
though
of
a
gun
being
discharged
and
the
whirr
of
a
shot
at
the
same
moment
i
fell
down
on
the
deck
as
though
mortally
wounded
and
lay
in
an
unconscious
state
for
two
hours
when
the
news
came
it
was
ascertained
that
at
the
very
moment
i
fell
and
the
was
heard
my
relative
in
austria
had
been
shot
in
the
head
and
fell
down
dead
and
he
had
been
seen
to
throw
his
hands
up
to
his
head
to
grasp
it
just
as
i
did
apparition
of
the
had
another
relative
who
died
in
a
hospital
near
christiania
norway
and
on
the
day
he
died
a
sister
of
mine
then
a
little
girl
saw
his
spirit
appear
here
in
lescoff
and
she
easily
recognized
it
but
none
of
her
girl
companions
with
her
at
the
time
saw
the
spirit
after
a
few
days
we
had
the
news
of
the
death
and
the
time
of
it
and
the
time
of
my
sister
seeing
the
spirit
coincided
exactly
in
all
the
peninsula
of
which
the
famous
and
dangerous
pointe
du
raz
is
the
terminus
similar
stories
are
current
and
among
the
with
whom
i
lived
on
the
strange
and
historic
île
de
sein
the
legend
of
the
dead
is
even
more
common
dead
and
fairies
without
setting
down
here
in
detail
numerous
other
which
we
have
collected
we
may
now
note
how
much
the
same
are
the
powers
and
nature
of
the
dead
and
spirits
in
brittany
and
the
power
and
nature
of
the
fairy
races
in
celtic
britain
and
ireland
thus
the
breton
dead
strike
down
the
living
just
as
fairies
are
said
to
do
the
who
is
a
king
of
the
dead
and
his
subjects
like
a
fairy
king
and
fairies
have
their
own
particular
paths
or
roads
over
which
they
travel
in
great
sacred
processions
and
exactly
as
fairies
the
hosts
of
the
dead
are
in
possession
of
the
earth
on
november
eve
and
the
living
are
expected
to
prepare
a
feast
and
entertainment
for
them
of
hot
pancakes
and
cider
served
on
the
family
table
covered
with
a
fresh
white
and
to
supply
music
the
breton
dead
come
to
enjoy
this
hospitality
of
their
friends
and
as
they
take
their
places
at
the
table
the
stools
are
heard
to
move
and
sometimes
the
plates
and
the
musicians
who
help
to
entertain
them
think
that
at
times
they
feel
the
cold
breath
of
the
invisible
visitors
concerning
this
same
feast
of
the
dead
villemarqué
in
his
records
that
in
many
parts
of
brittany
libations
of
milk
are
poured
over
or
near
ancestral
tombs
just
as
in
ireland
and
scotland
libations
of
milk
are
poured
to
fairies
and
the
people
of
armorica
at
other
times
than
november
eve
remember
the
dead
very
appropriately
as
in
ireland
the
irish
remember
fairies
the
breton
peasant
thinks
of
the
dead
as
frequently
as
the
irishman
thinks
of
fairies
one
day
while
i
was
walking
toward
carnac
there
was
told
to
me
in
the
most
ordinary
manner
a
story
about
a
dead
man
who
used
to
be
seen
going
along
the
very
road
i
was
on
he
quite
often
went
to
the
church
in
carnac
seeking
prayers
for
his
soul
and
almost
every
man
or
woman
one
meets
in
rural
lower
brittany
can
tell
many
similar
stories
if
a
mortal
should
happen
to
meet
one
of
the
dead
in
brittany
and
be
induced
to
eat
food
which
the
dead
sometimes
offer
he
will
never
be
able
to
return
among
the
living
for
the
effect
would
be
the
same
as
eating
like
ghosts
and
fairies
in
ireland
scotland
and
wales
in
brittany
the
dead
guard
hidden
treasure
it
is
after
sunset
that
the
dead
have
most
power
to
strike
down
the
living
and
to
them
just
as
fairies
do
a
natural
phenomenon
a
malady
a
death
or
a
tempest
may
be
the
work
of
a
spirit
in
brittany
and
in
ireland
the
work
of
a
fairy
the
breton
dead
like
the
scotch
fairies
described
in
kirk
are
capable
of
making
themselves
visible
or
invisible
to
mortals
at
will
their
bodies
for
they
have
bodies
are
material
being
composed
of
matter
in
a
state
unknown
to
us
and
the
bodies
of
daemons
as
described
by
the
ancients
are
made
of
congealed
air
the
dead
in
brittany
have
forms
more
slender
and
smaller
in
stature
than
those
of
the
living
and
herein
we
find
one
of
the
factors
which
supporters
of
the
pygmy
theory
would
emphasize
but
it
is
thoroughly
psychical
old
breton
farmers
after
death
return
to
their
farms
as
though
come
from
fairyland
and
sometimes
they
even
take
a
turn
at
the
ploughing
as
in
ireland
so
in
brittany
the
day
belongs
to
the
living
and
the
night
when
a
mortal
is
safer
indoors
than
out
to
spirits
and
the
dead
the
bretons
take
great
care
not
to
counterfeit
the
dead
nor
to
speak
slightingly
of
them
for
like
fairies
they
know
all
that
is
done
by
mortals
and
can
hear
all
that
is
said
about
them
and
can
take
revenge
just
as
in
the
case
of
all
fairies
and
goblins
the
dead
disappear
at
first
the
world
of
the
dead
like
the
land
of
faerie
or
the
otherworld
may
be
underground
in
the
air
in
a
hill
or
mountain
like
a
fairy
palace
under
a
river
or
sea
and
even
on
an
island
out
amid
the
ocean
as
other
celts
do
against
evil
spirits
and
fairies
the
breton
peasants
use
magic
against
evil
souls
of
the
dead
and
the
priests
use
exorcisms
the
breton
realm
of
the
dead
equally
with
the
irish
fairyland
is
an
invisible
world
peopled
by
other
kinds
of
spirits
besides
disembodied
mortals
and
fairies
the
dead
haunt
houses
just
as
robin
and
brownies
or
pixies
and
goblins
generally
do
the
dead
are
fond
of
frequenting
and
so
are
all
sorts
of
fairies
in
brittany
one
must
always
guard
against
the
evil
dead
in
cornwall
against
pixies
in
other
celtic
lands
against
different
kinds
of
fairies
in
ireland
and
scotland
there
is
the
banshee
in
wales
the
in
brittany
the
or
king
of
the
dead
to
foretell
a
death
and
as
the
banshee
wails
before
the
ancestral
mansion
so
the
sounds
its
doleful
cry
before
the
door
of
the
one
it
calls
there
seems
not
to
be
a
family
in
the
carnac
region
of
the
morbihan
without
some
tradition
of
a
warning
coming
before
the
death
of
one
of
its
members
in
ireland
only
certain
families
have
a
banshee
but
in
brittany
all
families
professor
le
braz
has
devoted
a
large
part
of
his
work
on
légende
de
la
to
these
breton
or
they
may
be
shades
of
the
dead
under
many
aspects
ghostly
hands
or
ghosts
of
inanimate
objects
they
may
come
by
the
fall
of
objects
without
known
cause
by
a
magpie
resting
on
a
roof
just
as
in
ireland
by
the
crowing
of
cocks
and
the
howling
of
dogs
at
night
they
may
be
or
torches
dreams
peculiar
bodily
sensations
images
in
water
phantom
funerals
and
or
as
in
wales
the
bretons
may
be
said
to
have
a
whereas
the
other
celts
have
a
and
both
are
a
real
innate
in
the
celtic
nature
and
thus
quite
as
influential
as
christianity
should
christianity
in
some
way
suddenly
be
swept
away
from
the
celt
he
would
still
be
religious
for
it
is
his
nature
to
be
so
and
as
professor
le
braz
has
suggested
to
me
carnac
with
its
strange
monuments
of
an
unknown
people
and
time
and
wrapped
in
its
air
of
mystery
and
silence
is
a
veritable
land
of
the
dead
i
too
have
felt
that
there
are
strange
vague
indefinable
influences
at
work
at
carnac
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
night
very
similar
to
those
which
i
have
felt
in
the
most
regions
of
ireland
we
might
say
that
all
of
brittany
is
a
land
of
the
dead
and
ancient
carnac
its
centre
just
as
ireland
is
fairyland
with
its
centre
at
ancient
tara
conclusion
we
can
very
appropriately
conclude
our
inquiry
about
brittany
with
a
very
beautiful
description
of
a
in
lower
brittany
written
down
in
french
for
our
special
use
by
the
breton
poet
le
scour
of
carnac
and
here
translated
le
scour
draws
the
whole
picture
from
life
and
from
his
own
intimate
experience
it
will
serve
to
give
us
some
insight
into
the
natural
literary
ability
of
the
breton
celts
to
illustrate
their
love
of
tales
dealing
with
the
marvellous
and
the
supernormal
and
is
especially
valuable
for
showing
the
social
environment
amidst
which
the
of
lower
brittany
lives
and
flourishes
isolated
from
foreign
interference
in
lower
wind
was
blowing
from
the
east
and
in
the
intermittent
moonlight
the
roof
of
the
thatched
cottage
already
gleamed
with
a
thin
covering
of
snow
which
had
fallen
since
sunset
each
comer
reached
on
the
run
the
comfortable
bakehouse
wherein
alain
corre
was
at
work
kneading
his
batch
of
barley
bread
and
the
father
le
scour
was
never
the
last
to
arrive
because
he
liked
to
get
the
best
seat
in
front
of
the
had
promised
us
for
that
night
a
pretty
story
which
no
person
had
ever
heard
before
i
was
not
more
than
fourteen
years
old
then
but
like
all
the
neighbours
i
hurried
to
get
a
place
in
order
to
hear
victor
my
mother
was
already
there
making
her
distaff
whirr
between
her
two
fingers
as
she
sat
in
the
light
of
a
rosin
candle
and
my
brother
yvon
was
finishing
a
wooden
every
few
minutes
i
and
my
little
cousin
went
out
to
see
if
it
was
still
snowing
and
if
victor
had
arrived
last
victor
entered
and
everybody
applauded
the
young
girls
lengthening
out
their
distaffs
to
do
him
reverence
then
when
silence
was
restored
after
some
of
the
older
men
had
several
times
shouted
out
let
us
commence
hold
your
tongues
victor
began
his
story
as
follows
formerly
in
the
village
of
plouneventer
finistère
there
were
two
neighbours
the
one
was
paol
al
ludu
and
the
other
yon
rustik
paol
al
ludu
was
a
sort
of
fellow
he
gained
his
living
easily
by
cheating
everybody
and
by
robbing
his
neighbours
and
being
always
well
dressed
he
was
much
envied
by
his
poorer
acquaintances
yon
rustik
on
the
contrary
was
a
poor
infirm
and
honest
man
always
seeking
to
do
good
but
not
being
able
to
work
had
to
beg
one
evening
our
two
men
were
disputing
paol
al
ludu
treated
yon
shamefully
telling
him
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
think
an
old
lame
man
such
as
he
was
could
ever
get
to
paris
i
added
paol
going
to
see
the
capital
and
amuse
myself
like
a
rich
at
this
yon
offered
to
bet
with
paol
that
in
spite
of
infirmities
he
would
also
go
to
paris
and
being
an
honest
man
he
placed
his
trust
in
god
the
wager
was
mutually
agreed
to
and
our
two
men
set
out
for
paris
by
different
routes
paol
al
ludu
who
had
no
infirmities
arrived
at
paris
within
three
weeks
he
followed
the
career
of
a
thief
and
deceived
everybody
and
as
he
was
well
dressed
people
had
confidence
in
him
the
poor
yon
rustik
on
the
contrary
did
not
travel
rapidly
he
was
obliged
to
beg
his
way
and
being
meanly
dressed
was
compelled
to
sleep
outdoors
when
he
could
not
find
a
stable
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
arrived
in
a
big
forest
in
the
region
of
versailles
and
having
no
other
shelter
for
the
night
chose
a
great
oak
tree
which
was
hollowed
by
the
centuries
and
lined
with
fungi
within
in
front
of
this
ancient
oak
there
was
a
fountain
which
must
have
been
miraculous
for
it
flowed
from
east
to
west
and
yon
had
closely
observed
it
towards
midnight
yon
was
awakened
by
a
terrible
uproar
there
were
a
hundred
dancing
round
the
fountain
he
overheard
one
of
them
say
to
the
others
have
news
to
report
to
you
i
have
cast
an
evil
spell
upon
the
daughter
of
the
king
and
no
mortal
will
ever
be
able
to
cure
her
and
yet
in
order
to
cure
her
nothing
more
would
be
needed
than
a
drop
of
water
from
this
fountain
the
who
thus
spoke
was
upon
two
sticks
crippled
and
commanded
all
the
others
the
beggar
having
understood
the
conversation
awaited
impatiently
the
departure
of
the
when
they
were
gone
he
took
a
little
water
from
the
fountain
in
a
bottle
and
hurried
on
to
paris
where
he
arrived
one
fine
morning
in
the
house
where
yon
stopped
to
eat
his
crust
of
dry
bread
he
heard
it
reported
that
the
daughter
of
the
king
was
very
ill
and
that
the
wisest
doctors
in
france
had
been
sent
for
three
days
later
yon
rustik
presented
himself
at
the
palace
and
asked
audience
with
the
king
but
as
he
was
so
shabbily
dressed
the
attendants
did
not
wish
to
let
him
enter
when
he
strongly
insisted
they
finally
prevailed
upon
the
king
to
receive
him
and
then
yon
told
the
king
that
he
had
come
to
cure
the
princess
thereupon
the
king
caused
yon
to
be
fittingly
dressed
and
presented
before
the
and
yon
drew
forth
his
bottle
of
water
and
at
his
request
the
princess
drank
it
to
the
last
drop
suddenly
she
began
to
laugh
with
joy
and
throwing
her
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
beggar
thanked
him
she
was
radically
cured
at
once
the
king
gave
orders
that
his
golden
coach
of
state
be
made
ready
and
placing
the
princess
and
the
beggar
on
one
seat
made
a
tour
throughout
all
the
most
beautiful
streets
of
paris
never
before
were
such
crowds
seen
in
paris
for
the
proclamation
had
gone
forth
that
the
one
who
had
made
the
miraculous
cure
was
a
beggar
paol
al
ludu
who
was
still
in
paris
pressed
forward
to
see
the
royal
coach
pass
and
when
he
saw
who
sat
next
to
the
princess
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
but
before
the
day
was
over
he
discovered
yon
in
the
great
hotel
of
the
city
and
asked
him
how
it
was
that
he
had
been
able
to
effect
the
cure
and
yon
replied
to
his
old
rival
that
it
was
with
the
water
of
a
miraculous
fountain
and
relating
everything
which
had
passed
explained
to
him
in
what
place
the
hollow
oak
and
the
fountain
were
to
be
found
paol
did
not
wait
even
that
night
but
set
off
at
once
to
find
the
miraculous
fountain
when
he
finally
found
it
the
hour
was
almost
midnight
and
so
he
hid
himself
in
the
hollow
of
the
oak
hoping
to
overhear
some
mysterious
revelation
midnight
had
hardly
come
when
a
frightful
uproar
commenced
this
time
the
crippled
chief
was
swearing
like
a
demon
and
he
cried
to
the
others
daughter
of
the
king
has
been
cured
by
a
beggar
he
must
have
overheard
us
by
hiding
in
the
hollow
of
that
d
d
old
oak
quick
let
fire
be
put
in
it
for
it
has
brought
us
misfortune
in
less
than
a
minute
the
trunk
of
the
oak
was
in
flames
and
there
were
heard
the
cries
of
anguish
of
paol
al
ludu
and
the
gnashing
of
his
teeth
as
he
fought
against
death
thus
the
evil
and
dishonest
man
ended
his
life
while
yon
rustik
received
a
pension
of
twenty
thousand
francs
and
was
able
to
live
happy
for
many
years
and
to
give
alms
to
the
poor
here
le
scour
ends
his
narrative
leaving
the
reader
to
imagine
the
enthusiastic
applause
and
fond
embraces
bestowed
upon
victor
for
this
most
marvellous
story
by
the
happy
gathering
of
in
that
cosy
warm
bakehouse
in
lower
brittany
while
without
the
cold
east
wind
of
winter
was
whirling
into
every
nook
and
corner
the
falling
flakes
of
snow
the
evidence
from
ireland
scotland
isle
of
man
wales
cornwall
and
brittany
which
the
living
celtic
offers
has
now
been
heard
and
as
was
stated
at
the
beginning
of
the
inquiry
apparently
most
of
it
can
only
be
interpreted
as
belonging
to
a
doctrine
of
souls
but
before
this
decision
can
be
arrived
at
safely
all
the
evidence
should
be
carefully
estimated
according
to
anthropological
and
psychological
methods
and
this
we
shall
proceed
to
do
in
the

the
modern

in

with
which
until
now
we
have
been
specifically
concerned
is
celtic
only
in
so
far
as
it
reflects
celtic
traditions
and
customs
celtic
myth
and
religion
and
celtic
social
and
environmental
conditions
otherwise
as
will
be
shown
throughout
this
and
succeeding
chapters
it
is
in
essence
a
part
of
a
animism
which
forms
the
background
of
all
religions
in
whatever
stage
of
culture
religions
exist
or
to
which
they
have
attained
by
evolution
from
the
barbarism
of
the
congo
black
man
to
the
civilization
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
as
far
back
as
we
can
go
into
human
origins
there
is
some
corresponding
belief
in
a
fairy
or
spirit
realm
as
there
is
among
contemporary
civilized
and
uncivilized
races
of
all
countries
we
may
therefore
very
profitably
begin
our
examination
of
the
living
of
the
celts
by
comparing
it
with
a
few
examples
taken
almost
at
random
from
the
animistic
beliefs
current
among
peoples
to
the
arunta
tribes
of
central
australia
furthest
removed
in
space
from
the
celts
and
hence
least
likely
to
have
been
influenced
by
them
let
us
go
first
in
order
to
examine
their
doctrine
of
ancestral
beings
and
of
the
which
offers
an
almost
complete
parallel
to
the
celtic
belief
in
fairies
these
beings
and
to
ignore
the
secondary
differences
between
the
two
are
a
spirit
race
inhabiting
an
invisible
or
fairy
world
only
certain
persons
and
seers
can
see
them
and
these
describe
them
as
thin
and
shadowy
and
like
the
irish
as
always
youthful
in
appearance
precisely
like
their
celtic
counterparts
in
general
these
australian
spirits
are
believed
to
haunt
inanimate
objects
such
as
stones
and
trees
or
to
frequent
totem
centres
as
in
ireland
demons
daemons
are
believed
to
frequent
certain
places
known
to
have
been
anciently
dedicated
to
the
religious
rites
of
the
celts
and
quite
after
the
manner
of
the
breton
dead
and
of
most
fairies
they
are
said
to
control
human
affairs
and
natural
phenomena
all
the
arunta
invariably
regard
themselves
as
incarnations
or
reincarnations
of
these
ancestral
and
in
accordance
with
evidence
to
be
set
forth
in
our
seventh
chapter
ancient
and
modern
celts
have
likewise
regarded
themselves
as
incarnations
or
reincarnations
of
ancestors
and
of
fairy
beings
also
the
arunta
think
of
the
beings
exactly
as
celts
think
of
fairies
as
real
invisible
entities
who
must
be
propitiated
if
men
wish
to
secure
their
goodwill
and
as
beneficent
and
protecting
beings
when
not
offended
who
may
attach
themselves
to
individuals
as
guardian
spirits
among
the
melanesian
peoples
there
is
an
equally
firm
faith
in
spiritual
beings
which
they
call
and
and
these
beings
have
very
many
of
the
chief
attributes
of
the
beings
in
africa
the
or
of
amazulu
belief
have
essentially
the
same
motives
for
action
toward
men
and
women
and
exhibit
the
same
powers
as
the
scotch
and
irish
peasants
assign
to
the
people
they
the
living
through
death
and
people
so
appear
afterwards
as
apparitions
having
become
in
the
new
world
we
find
in
the
north
american
red
men
a
race
as
much
given
as
the
celts
are
to
a
belief
in
various
spirits
like
fairies
they
believe
that
there
are
spirits
in
lakes
in
rivers
and
in
waterfalls
in
rocks
and
trees
in
the
earth
and
in
the
air
and
that
these
beings
produce
storms
droughts
good
and
bad
harvests
abundance
and
scarcity
of
game
disease
and
the
varying
fortunes
of
men
leland
who
has
carefully
studied
these
american
beliefs
says
that
the
à
or
little
spirits
inhabiting
rocks
and
streams
play
a
much
more
influential
part
in
the
social
and
religious
life
of
the
north
american
red
men
than
elves
or
fairies
ever
did
among
the
aryans
in
asia
there
is
the
and
elaborate
animistic
creed
of
the
chinese
and
of
the
japanese
to
be
in
part
illustrated
in
subsequent
sections
in
popular
indian
belief
as
found
in
the
panjab
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
various
orders
of
beings
endowed
with
immortality
such
as
ghosts
and
spirits
on
the
one
hand
and
gods
and
warriors
on
the
other
for
whether
in
bodies
in
this
world
or
out
of
bodies
in
the
invisible
world
they
equally
live
and
act
quite
as
fairies
do
throughout
the
malay
peninsula
belief
in
many
orders
of
good
and
bad
spirits
in
in
exorcism
and
in
the
power
of
black
magicians
is
very
common
but
in
the
races
of
siam
we
discover
what
is
probably
the
most
important
and
complete
parallel
to
the
celtic
existing
in
asia
according
to
the
siamese
all
the
stars
and
various
planets
as
well
as
the
ethereal
spaces
are
the
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
of
the
old
mythology
who
correspond
pretty
closely
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
of
irish
mythology
and
this
world
itself
is
peopled
by
legions
of
minor
deities
called
who
include
all
the
various
orders
of
good
and
bad
spirits
continually
influencing
mankind
some
of
these
live
in
forests
in
trees
in
open
spaces
and
watercourses
are
full
of
them
others
inhabit
mountains
and
high
places
a
particular
order
who
haunt
the
sacred
trees
surrounding
the
buddhist
temples
are
known
as
nang
and
since
is
the
word
for
female
and
for
tree
they
are
comparable
to
fairies
or
greek
still
another
order
called
phum
gods
of
the
earth
are
like
brownies
fairies
and
pixies
or
like
certain
orders
of
who
haunt
barns
stables
and
dwellings
and
in
many
curious
details
these
phum
correspond
to
the
penates
of
ancient
rome
not
only
is
the
worship
of
this
order
of
widespread
in
siam
but
to
every
other
order
of
altars
are
erected
and
propitiatory
offerings
made
by
all
classes
of
the
siamese
people
before
passing
westwards
to
europe
in
completion
of
our
rapid
tour
of
the
world
we
may
observe
that
the
persians
even
those
who
are
well
educated
have
a
firm
belief
in
and
different
orders
of
good
and
bad
spirits
with
all
the
chief
characteristics
of
fairies
and
modern
arabs
and
egyptians
and
egyptian
turks
hold
similar
animistic
beliefs
in
europe
the
greek
peasant
as
firmly
believes
in
nymphs
or
nereids
as
the
celtic
peasant
believes
in
fairies
and
nymphs
nereids
and
fairies
alike
are
often
the
survivals
of
an
ancient
mythology
lawson
who
has
very
carefully
investigated
the
of
modern
greece
says
nereids
are
conceived
as
women
yet
not
immortal
always
young
always
beautiful
capricious
at
best
and
at
their
worst
cruel
their
presence
is
suspected
everywhere
i
myself
had
a
nereid
pointed
out
to
me
by
my
guide
and
there
certainly
was
the
semblance
of
a
female
figure
draped
in
white
and
tall
beyond
human
stature
flitting
in
the
dusk
between
the
gnarled
and
twisted
boles
of
an
old
what
the
apparition
was
i
had
no
leisure
to
investigate
for
my
guide
with
many
signs
of
the
cross
and
muttered
invocations
of
the
virgin
urged
my
mule
to
perilous
haste
along
the
rough
mountain
path
like
celtic
fairies
these
greek
nereids
have
their
queens
they
dance
all
night
disappearing
at
they
can
cast
spells
on
animals
or
maladies
on
men
and
women
they
can
shift
their
shape
they
children
in
death
and
make
changelings
and
they
fall
in
love
with
young
men
among
the
roumain
peoples
the
widespread
belief
in
the
shows
in
other
ways
equally
marked
parallels
with
the
of
the
celts
these
wait
at
and
near
dwellings
or
at
village
fountains
or
in
fields
and
woods
where
they
can
best
cast
on
men
and
women
various
maladies
sometimes
they
fall
in
love
with
beautiful
young
men
and
women
and
have
on
such
occasions
even
been
controlled
by
their
mortal
lovers
they
are
extremely
fond
of
music
and
dancing
and
many
a
shepherd
with
his
pipes
has
been
favoured
by
them
though
they
have
their
own
music
and
songs
too
the
albanian
peoples
have
evil
fairies
no
taller
than
children
twelve
years
old
called
in
modern
greek
τα
εξωτικα
without
who
correspond
to
the
young
people
who
have
been
enticed
to
enter
their
round
dance
afterwards
waste
away
and
die
apparently
becoming
one
of
without
these
albanian
spirits
like
the
people
and
the
breton
dead
have
their
own
particular
paths
and
retreats
and
whoever
violates
these
is
struck
and
falls
these
parallels
from
roumain
lands
are
probably
due
to
the
close
aryan
relationship
between
the
roumains
the
greeks
and
the
celts
the
seem
nothing
more
than
the
nymphs
and
nereids
of
classical
antiquity
transformed
under
christian
influence
into
beings
who
contradict
their
original
good
character
as
in
celtic
lands
the
have
likewise
come
to
be
fallen
angels
and
evil
spirits
there
is
an
even
closer
relationship
between
the
italian
and
celtic
fairies
for
example
among
the
people
there
are
now
flourishing
animistic
beliefs
almost
identical
in
all
details
with
the
of
the
celts
in
a
very
valuable
study
on
the
fay
coote
writes
were
the
fays
the
of
later
italy
the
of
mediaeval
france
for
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
and
are
all
one
and
the
same
word
and
he
proceeds
to
show
that
the
race
of
immortal
damsels
whom
the
old
natives
of
italy
called
gave
origin
to
all
the
family
of
as
these
appear
in
latin
countries
and
that
the
italians
recognized
in
the
greek
nymphs
their
own
it
is
quite
evident
that
we
have
here
discovered
in
italy
as
we
discovered
in
greece
and
roumain
lands
fairies
very
celtic
in
character
and
should
further
examination
be
made
of
modern
european
yet
other
similar
fairies
would
be
found
such
for
example
as
the
elves
of
germany
and
of
scandinavia
or
as
the
of
the
swiss
peasant
and
in
all
cases
whether
the
beliefs
examined
be
celtic
or
aryan
or
from
australia
polynesia
africa
america
asia
or
europe
they
are
in
essence
animistically
the
same
as
later
sections
in
this
chapter
will
make
clear
but
while
the
parallelism
of
these
beliefs
is
indicated
it
is
of
course
not
meant
for
a
moment
that
in
all
of
the
cases
or
in
any
one
of
the
cases
the
specific
differences
are
not
considerable
the
ground
of
comparison
consists
simply
in
those
generic
characteristics
which
these
as
they
may
be
called
invariably
display
characteristics
which
we
have
good
precedent
for
summing
up
in
the
single
adjective
animistic
shaping
influence
of
social
psychology
for
the
term
animism
we
have
to
thank
tylor
whose
in
which
the
animistic
theory
is
developed
may
almost
be
said
to
mark
the
beginning
of
scientific
anthropology
in
this
work
however
there
is
a
decided
tendency
which
indeed
displays
itself
in
most
of
the
leading
anthropological
works
as
for
example
in
those
by
frazer
to
regard
men
or
at
any
rate
primitive
men
as
having
a
mind
absolutely
homogeneous
and
therefore
as
thinking
feeling
and
acting
in
the
same
way
under
all
conditions
alike
but
a
decided
change
is
beginning
to
manifest
itself
in
the
interpretation
of
the
customs
and
beliefs
of
the
ruder
races
it
is
assumed
as
a
working
principle
that
each
ethnic
group
has
or
tends
to
have
an
individuality
of
its
own
and
moreover
that
the
members
of
such
a
group
think
feel
and
act
primarily
as
the
representatives
so
to
speak
of
that
ethnic
individuality
in
which
they
live
move
and
have
their
being
that
is
to
say
a
social
as
contrasted
with
an
individual
psychology
must
it
is
held
pronounce
both
the
first
and
last
word
regarding
all
matters
of
mythology
religion
and
art
in
its
numerous
forms
the
reason
is
that
these
are
social
products
and
as
such
are
to
be
understood
only
in
the
light
of
the
laws
governing
the
workings
of
the
collective
mind
of
any
particular
ethnic
group
such
a
method
is
for
instance
employed
in
william
mcdougall
in
marett
of
and
in
many
anthropological
articles
to
be
found
in
if
therefore
we
hold
by
this
new
and
fruitful
method
of
social
psychology
we
must
be
prepared
to
treat
the
of
the
celtic
peoples
also
in
and
for
itself
as
expressive
of
an
individuality
more
or
less
unique
it
might
indeed
be
objected
that
these
peoples
are
not
a
single
social
group
but
rather
a
number
of
such
groups
and
this
is
in
a
way
true
nevertheless
their
displays
such
remarkable
homogeneity
from
whatever
quarter
of
the
celtic
world
it
be
derived
that
it
seems
the
soundest
method
to
treat
them
as
one
people
for
all
the
purposes
of
the
student
of
sociology
mythology
and
religion
granting
then
such
a
unity
in
the
beliefs
of
the
race
we
are
finally
obliged
to
distinguish
as
it
were
two
aspects
thereof
on
the
one
hand
there
is
shown
even
in
the
mere
handful
of
parallels
which
for
reasons
of
space
we
have
been
content
to
cite
as
well
as
in
their
celtic
equivalents
a
generic
element
common
to
all
peoples
living
under
primitive
conditions
of
society
it
is
emphatically
a
social
element
but
at
the
same
time
one
which
any
primitive
society
is
bound
to
display
on
the
other
hand
in
a
second
aspect
the
celtic
beliefs
show
of
themselves
a
character
which
is
wholly
celtic
in
the
which
is
generically
animistic
we
find
reflected
all
sorts
of
specific
characteristics
of
the
celtic
peoples
their
patriotism
their
peculiar
type
of
imagination
their
costumes
amusements
household
life
and
social
and
religious
customs
generally
with
this
fact
in
mind
we
may
proceed
to
examine
certain
of
the
more
specialized
aspects
of
the
as
manifested
both
among
celts
and
elsewhere
the
smallness
of
elvish
spirits
and
fairies
or
pygmy
in
any
anthropological
estimate
of
the
the
pygmy
stature
so
commonly
attributed
to
various
orders
of
celtic
and
of
fairies
should
be
considered
various
scholarly
champions
of
the
pygmy
theory
have
attempted
to
explain
this
smallness
of
fairies
by
means
of
the
hypothesis
that
the
belief
in
such
fairies
is
due
to
a
of
races
and
they
add
that
these
races
having
dwelt
in
caverns
like
the
prehistoric
cave
men
and
in
underground
houses
like
those
of
lapps
or
eskimos
gave
rise
to
the
belief
in
a
fairy
world
existing
in
caverns
and
under
hills
or
mountains
when
analysed
our
evidence
shows
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
witnesses
have
regarded
fairies
either
as
or
else
as
spirits
of
the
dead
that
in
a
comparatively
limited
number
of
cases
they
have
regarded
them
as
the
souls
of
prehistoric
races
and
that
occasionally
they
have
regarded
the
belief
in
them
as
due
to
a
of
such
races
it
follows
then
from
such
an
analysis
of
evidence
that
the
pygmy
theory
probably
does
explain
some
ethnological
elements
which
have
come
to
be
almost
inseparably
interwoven
with
the
essentially
animistic
fabric
of
the
primitive
but
though
the
theory
may
so
account
for
such
ethnological
elements
it
disregards
the
animism
that
has
made
such
interweaving
possible
and
on
the
whole
we
are
inclined
to
accept
jenner
view
of
the
theory
see
since
the
pygmy
theory
thus
fails
entirely
to
provide
a
basis
for
what
is
by
far
the
most
important
part
of
the
a
more
adequate
theory
is
required
the
testimony
of
celtic
literature
goes
to
show
that
leprechauns
and
similar
dwarfish
beings
are
not
due
to
a
of
a
real
pygmy
race
that
they
are
spirits
like
elves
and
that
the
of
a
people
who
may
have
been
picts
evidently
was
confused
with
them
so
as
to
result
in
their
being
anthropomorphosed
thus
in
there
is
reference
to
an
apparently
man
who
may
be
a
pict
and
as
campbell
who
records
the
ancient
tale
has
observed
there
are
many
similar
traditional
highland
tales
about
little
men
or
even
about
true
dwarfs
who
are
good
bowmen
but
it
is
very
certain
that
such
tales
have
often
blended
with
other
tales
in
which
supernatural
figures
like
fairies
play
a
rôle
and
apparently
the
former
kind
of
tales
are
much
more
historical
and
modern
in
their
origin
while
the
latter
are
more
mythological
and
extremely
archaic
this
blending
of
the
natural
or
ethnological
and
the
supernatural
in
quite
the
same
manner
as
in
the
modern
is
clearly
seen
in
another
of
campbell
collected
tales
lad
with
the
skin
which
in
essence
is
an
otherworld
tale
little
thickset
man
in
a
russet
coat
who
is
a
magician
but
who
otherwise
seems
to
be
a
genuine
lapp
dressed
in
furs
is
introduced
into
a
story
where
real
beings
play
the
chief
parts
again
in
irish
literature
we
read
of
a
or
of
the
pygmies
light
is
thrown
upon
this
reference
by
what
is
recorded
about
the
leprechauns
and
fergus
while
asleep
on
the
seashore
one
day
fergus
was
about
to
be
carried
off
by
the
he
awoke
and
caught
three
of
them
to
wit
one
in
each
of
his
two
hands
and
one
on
his
breast
life
for
life
protection
say
they
let
my
three
wishes
choices
be
given
says
fergus
thou
shalt
have
says
the
dwarf
save
that
which
is
impossible
for
us
fergus
requested
of
him
knowledge
of
passing
under
loughs
and
linns
and
seas
thou
shalt
have
says
the
dwarf
save
one
which
i
forbid
to
thee
thou
shalt
not
go
under
lough
rudraide
which
is
in
thine
own
country
thereafter
the
little
bodies
put
herbs
into
his
ears
and
he
used
to
go
with
them
under
seas
others
say
the
dwarf
gave
his
cloak
to
him
and
that
fergus
used
to
put
it
on
his
head
and
thus
go
under
seas
in
an
etymological
comment
on
this
passage
sir
john
rhŷs
says
words
and
leprechaun
appear
to
mean
literally
small
bodies
and
the
word
here
rendered
is
in
the
irish
the
etymological
equivalent
of
the
welsh
the
name
by
which
certain
water
inhabitants
of
a
mythic
nature
went
in
welsh
besides
what
we
find
in
the
recorded
there
are
very
many
parallel
traditions
both
celtic
and
about
various
classes
of
spirits
like
leprechauns
or
other
small
elvish
beings
which
tylor
has
called
and
apparently
all
of
these
can
best
be
accounted
for
by
means
of
the
animistic
hypothesis
for
example
in
north
america
as
in
celtic
lands
there
is
no
proof
of
there
ever
having
been
an
actual
dwarf
race
but
lewis
and
clark
in
their
to
the
source
of
the
missouri
found
among
the
sioux
a
tradition
that
a
hill
near
the
whitestone
river
which
the
red
men
called
the
of
little
people
or
spirits
was
inhabited
by
pygmy
demons
in
human
form
about
eighteen
inches
tall
armed
with
sharp
arrows
and
ever
on
the
alert
to
kill
mortals
who
should
dare
to
invade
their
domain
so
afraid
were
all
the
tribes
of
red
men
who
lived
near
the
mountain
of
these
little
spirits
that
no
one
of
them
could
be
induced
to
visit
it
and
we
may
compare
this
american
hill
with
similar
natural
hills
in
scotland
said
to
be
fairy
knolls
one
near
the
turning
of
a
road
from
reay
wick
to
safester
isle
of
unst
one
the
tomnahurich
near
inverness
and
a
third
the
hill
at
aberfoyle
on
which
the
of
peace
took
the
rev
robert
kirk
when
he
profaned
it
by
walking
on
it
or
we
may
equate
the
american
hill
with
the
slieve
gullion
and
ben
bulbin
in
ireland
the
iroquois
had
a
belief
that
they
could
summon
dwarfs
who
were
similar
by
knocking
on
a
certain
large
stone
likewise

are
pygmies

entirely
independent
of
the
common
legends
about
wild
races
of
pygmy
stature
are
myths
about
the
spirits
called
or
who
correspond
to
european
dwarfs
and

these
little

seem
to
occupy
the

position
toward
the

heroes
qat
of

of

beyond
the
borders
of
celtic
lands
in
southern
asia
with
its
islands
in
melanesia
with
new
guinea
and
in
central
africa
pygmy
races
generally
called
negritos
exist
at
the
present
day
but
they
themselves
have
a
just
as
their
primitive
neighbours
have
and
it
would
hardly
be
reasonable
to
argue
that
either
of
the
two
is
due
to
a
of
peoples
ancient
and
thoroughly
reliable
manuscript
records
testify
to
the
existence
of
pygmies
in
china
during
the
century
yet
no
one
has
ever
tried
to
explain
the
animistic
beliefs
of
modern
chinamen
in
ghosts
demons
and
in
little
like
fairies
by
saying
that
these
are
a
of
this
ancient
pygmy
race
in
yezo
and
the
kurile
islands
of
japan
still
survive
a
few
of
the
hairy
ainu
a
race
and
their
immediate
predecessors
whom
they
exterminated
were
a
negrito
race
who
according
to
some
traditions
were
two
to
three
feet
in
stature
and
according
to
other
traditions
only
one
inch
in
stature
both
pygmy
races
the
surviving
and
the
exterminated
race
seem
independently
to
have
evolved
a
belief
in
ghosts
and
spirits
so
that
here
again
it
need
not
be
argued
that
the
present
animism
of
the
japanese
is
due
to
a
of
either
ainus
or
negritos
further
examination
of
the
animistic
hypothesis
designed
to
explain
the
smallness
of
elvish
spirits
leads
away
from
mere
mythology
into
psychology
and
sets
us
the
task
of
finding
out
if
after
all
primitive
ideas
about
the
disembodied
human
soul
may
not
have
originated
or
at
least
have
helped
to
shape
the
celtic
folk
conception
of
fairies
as
beings
crawley
in
his
of
the
pp
shows
by
carefully
selected
evidence
from
ancient
and
modern
psychologies
that
among
the
attributes
of
the
soul
in
its
primary
form
may
be
placed
its
size
and
that
the
majority
of
cases
it
is
a
miniature
replica
of
the
person
described
often
as
a
mannikin
or
homunculus
of
a
few
inches
in
height
sometimes
the
soul
is
described
as
only
about
three
inches
in
stature
frazer
shows
likewise
that
by
practically
all
contemporary
primitive
peoples
the
soul
is
commonly
regarded
as
a
dwarf
the
same
opinions
regarding
the
human
soul
prevailed
among
ancient
peoples
highly
civilized
the
egyptians
and
greeks
and
may
have
thence
directly
influenced
celtic
tradition
thus
in
on
the
egyptian
temple
of
el
queen
hatshepsû
rāmaka
is
making
offerings
of
perfume
to
the
gods
while
just
behind
her
stands
her
soul
as
a
pygmy
so
little
that
the
crown
of
its
head
is
just
on
a
level
with
her
waist
the
is
usually
represented
as
about
half
the
size
of
an
ordinary
man
in
the
of
the
the
which
like
the
is
one
of
the
many
separable
parts
of
the
soul
is
represented
as
a
very
little
man
with
wings
and
body
on
greek
vases
the
human
soul
is
depicted
as
a
pygmy
issuing
from
the
body
through
the
mouth
and
this
conception
existed
among
romans
and
teutons
like
their
predecessors
the
egyptians
the
greeks
also
often
represented
the
soul
as
a
small
winged
human
figure
and
romans
in
turn
imagined
the
soul
as
a
pygmy
with
butterfly
wings
these
ideas
reappear
in
mediaeval
reliefs
and
pictures
wherein
the
soul
is
shown
as
a
child
or
little
naked
man
going
out
of
the
dying
person
mouth
and
according
to
cædmon
who
was
educated
by
celtic
teachers
angels
are
small
and
beautiful
quite
like
good
fairies
and
mystical
in
the
positive
doctrines
of
mediaeval
alchemists
and
mystics
paracelsus
and
the
rosicrucians
as
well
as
their
modern
followers
the
ancient
metaphysical
ideas
of
egypt
greece
and
rome
find
a
new
expression
and
these
doctrines
raise
the
final
problem
if
there
are
any
scientific
grounds
for
believing
in
such
pygmy
as
these
remarkable
thinkers
of
the
middle
ages
claim
to
have
studied
as
beings
actually
existing
in
nature
to
some
extent
this
interesting
problem
will
be
examined
in
our
chapter
entitled
and
here
we
shall
simply
outline
the
metaphysical
theory
adding
the
testimony
of
some
of
its
living
advocates
to
explain
the
smallness
of
elvish
spirits
and
fairies
these
mediaeval
metaphysicians
inheritors
of
platonic
and
teachings
purposely
obscured
their
doctrines
under
a
covering
of
alchemical
terms
so
as
to
safeguard
themselves
against
persecution
open
discussion
of
occultism
not
being
safe
during
the
middle
ages
as
it
was
among
the
ancients
and
happily
is
now
again
in
our
own
generation
but
they
were
quite
scientific
in
their
methods
for
they
divided
all
invisible
beings
into
four
distinct
classes
the
angels
who
in
character
and
function
are
parallel
to
the
gods
of
the
ancients
and
equal
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
of
the
irish
are
the
highest
below
them
are
the
devils
or
demons
who
correspond
to
the
fallen
angels
of
christianity
the
third
class
includes
all
elementals
who
are
generally
regarded
as
having
pygmy
stature
like
the
greek
daemons
and
the
fourth
division
comprises
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
the
shades
or
ghosts
of
the
dead
for
us
the
third
class
which
includes
spirits
of
form
is
the
most
important
in
this
present
discussion
all
its
members
are
of
four
kinds
according
as
they
inhabit
one
of
the
four
chief
elements
of
nature
those
inhabiting
the
earth
are
called
gnomes
they
are
definitely
of
pygmy
stature
and
friendly
to

and
in
ordinarily
correspond
to
fairies
or
goblins
to
pixies
leprechauns
and
to
such
elves
as
live
in
rocks
caverns
or
earth
an
important
consideration
entirely
overlooked
by
champions
of
the
pygmy
theory
those
inhabiting
the
air
are
called
sylphs
these
sylphs
commonly
described
as
little
spirits
like
pygmies
in
form
correspond
to
most
of
the
fairies
who
are
not
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
type
and
who
as
a
race
are
beautiful
and
graceful
they
are
quite
like
the
fairies
in
shakespeare
and
especially
like
the
aerials
in
which
according
to
morton
luce
a
commentator
on
the
drama
seem
to
have
been
shaped
by
shakespeare
from
his
knowledge
of
rosicrucian
occultism
in
which
such
spirits
hold
an
important
place
those
inhabiting
the
water
are
called
undines
and
correspond
exactly
to
the
fairies
who
live
in
sacred
fountains
lakes
or
rivers
and
the
fourth
kind
those
inhabiting
the
fire
are
called
salamanders
and
seldom
appear
in
the
celtic
they
are
supreme
in
the
elementary
hierarchies
all
these
elementals
who
procreate
after
the
manner
of
men
are
said
to
have
bodies
of
an
elastic
essence
which
is
sufficiently
ethereal
not
to
be
visible
to
the
physical
sight
and
probably
comparable
to
matter
in
the
form
of
invisible
gases
yeats
has
given
this
explanation
poets
and
all
mystic
and
occult
writers
in
all
ages
and
countries
have
declared
that
behind
the
visible
are
chains
on
chains
of
conscious
beings
who
are
not
of
heaven
but
of
the
earth
who
have
no
inherent
form
but
change
according
to
their
whim
or
the
mind
that
sees
them
you
can
not
lift
your
hand
without
influencing
and
being
influenced
by
hordes
the
visible
world
is
merely
their
skin
in
dreams
we
go
amongst
them
and
play
with
them
and
combat
with
them
they
are
perhaps
human
souls
in
the
crucible
these
creatures
of
whim
and
bringing
this
into
relation
with
ordinary
fairies
he
says
not
think
the
fairies
are
always
little
everything
is
capricious
about
them
even
their
size
they
seem
to
take
what
size
or
shape
pleases
them
in
celtic
yeats
makes
the
statement
that
the
in
ireland
are
sometimes
as
big
as
we
are
sometimes
bigger
and
sometimes
as
i
have
been
told
about
three
feet
high
x
a
cultured
irishwoman
now
living
in
county
dublin
who
as
a
percipient
fulfils
all
the
exacting
requirements
which
psychologists
and
pathologists
would
demand
tells
me
that
very
frequently
she
has
had
visions
of
fairy
beings
in
ireland
and
her
own
classification
and
description
of
these
fairy
beings
chiefly
according
to
their
stature
are
as
follows
the
usually
invisible
races
which
i
have
seen
in
ireland
i
distinguish
five
classes
there
are
the
gnomes
who
are
and
who
seem
to
be
a
sorrowful
race
i
once
saw
some
of
them
distinctly
on
the
side
of
ben
bulbin
they
had
rather
round
heads
and
dark
bodies
and
in
stature
were
about
two
and
feet
the
leprechauns
are
different
being
full
of
mischief
though
they
too
are
small
i
followed
a
leprechaun
from
the
town
of
wicklow
out
to
the
rock
of
the
fairies
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
or
more
where
he
disappeared
he
had
a
very
merry
face
and
beckoned
to
me
with
his
finger
a
third
class
are
the
little
people
who
unlike
the
gnomes
and
leprechauns
are
quite
and
they
are
very
small
the
good
people
are
tall
beautiful
beings
as
tall
as
ourselves
to
judge
by
those
i
saw
at
the
in
rosses
point
they
direct
the
magnetic
currents
of
the
earth
the
gods
are
really
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
they
are
much
taller
than
our
race
there
may
be
many
other
classes
of
invisible
beings
which
i
do
not
know
recorded
on
october
and
independently
of
the
celtic
peoples
there
is
available
very
much
testimony
of
the
most
reliable
character
from
modern
disciples
of
the
mediaeval
occultists
the
rosicrucians
and
the
theosophists
that
there
exist
in
nature
invisible
spiritual
beings
of
pygmy
stature
and
of
various
forms
and
characters
comparable
in
all
respects
to
the
little
people
of
celtic
how
all
this
is
parallel
to
the
celtic
is
perfectly
evident
and
no
comment
of
ours
is
necessary
this
point
of
view
presented
by
mediaeval
and
modern
occult
sciences
and
confirmed
by
celtic
and
percipients
when
considered
in
relation
to
its
sources
and
then
at
once
contrasted
with
ancient
and
modern
celtic
beliefs
of
the
same
character
which
constitute
it
to
be
seen
in
the
above
gaelic
and
brythonic
manuscript
and
other
evidence
and
in
cædmon
theory
that
angels
are
small
beings
plunges
us
into
the
very
complex
and
extremely
difficult
problem
how
far
fairies
as
pygmy
spirits
may
be
purely
celtic
and
how
far
they
may
reflect
beliefs
not
celtic
the
problem
however
is
far
too
complicated
to
be
discussed
here
and
one
may
briefly
say
that
there
seems
to
have
been
a
time
in
the
evolution
of
animism
when
the
ancient
celts
of
britain
of
ireland
and
of
continental
europe
too
held
in
common
with
the
ancient
greeks
romans
and
teutons
an
original
aryan
doctrine
this
doctrine
after
these
four
stocks
separated
in
possession
of
it
began
to
evolve
its
four
specialized
aspects
which
we
now
can
study
and
in
the
irish
universities
of
the
early
christian
centuries
when
ireland
was
the
centre
of
european
learning
the
classical
and
celtic
aspects
of
it
met
for
the
first
time
since
their
prehistoric
divorcement
there
as
is
clearly
seen
later
among
the
mediaeval
alchemists
and
occultists
a
new
influence
from
christian
theology
was
superadded
to
the
ancient
animistic
beliefs
of
europe
as
they
had
evolved
up
to
that
time
the
ethnological
argument
after
allowing
for
all
its
shortcomings
suggests
that
races
like
lapps
and
eskimos
though
not
necessarily
true
pygmy
races
of
whose
existence
in
europe
there
is
no
proof
available
did
once
inhabit
lands
where
there
are
celts
and
that
a
celtic
of
these
could
conceivably
have
originated
a
belief
in
certain
kinds
of
fairies
and
thus
have
been
a
shaping
influence
in
the
animistic
traditions
about
other
fairies
the
animistic
argument
shows
that
pygmies
described
in
celtic
literature
and
in
celtic
and
mythologies
are
nearly
always
to
be
thought
of
as
spirits
and
that
there
is
now
and
was
in
past
ages
a
belief
that
the
human
soul
is
in
stature
a
pygmy
the
philosophical
argument
of
alchemists
and
mystics
in
a
way
draws
to
itself
the
animistic
argument
and
sets
up
the
hypothesis
that
the
smallness
of
elves
and
fairies
is
due
to
their
own
nature
because
they
actually
exist
as
invisible
tribes
of
beings
of
pygmy
size
and
form
the
changeling
belief
the
smallness
of
fairies
which
has
just
been
considered
and
the
belief
in
changelings
are
the
two
most
prominent
characteristics
of
the
according
to
our
evidence
in
chapter
ii
and
we
are
now
to
consider
the
second
the
prevalent
and
apparently
the
only
important
theories
which
are
current
to
explain
this
belief
in
changelings
may
be
designated
as
the
kidnap
theory
and
the
theory
these
we
shall
proceed
to
estimate
after
which
there
will
be
introduced
newer
and
seemingly
more
adequate
theories
some
writers
have
argued
that
the
changeling
belief
merely
reflects
a
time
when
the
aboriginal
peoples
held
in
subjection
by
the
celts
and
forced
to
live
in
mountain
caverns
and
in
secret
retreats
underground
occasionally
kidnapped
the
children
of
their
conquerors
and
that
such
kidnapped
children
sometimes
escaped
and
told
to
their
celtic
kinsmen
highly
romantic
tales
about
having
been
in
an
underground
with
fairies
frequently
this
argument
has
taken
a
slightly
different
form
that
instead
of
unfriendly
peoples
it
was
druids
who
either
through
their
own
choice
or
else
having
been
driven
to
bay
by
the
spread
of
christianity
through
force
of
circumstances
dwelt
in
secret
in
chambered
mounds
or
souterrains
or
in
dense
forests
and
then
stole
young
people
for
recruits
sometimes
permitting
them
years
afterwards
when
too
old
to
be
of
further
use
to
return
home
under
an
inviolable
vow
of
secrecy
and
david
macritchie
in
supporting
his
own
pygmy
theory
has
made
interesting
modern
elaborations
of
these
two
slightly
different
theories
concerning
changelings
as
already
pointed
out
there
are
definite
ethnological
elements
blended
in
the
other
parts
of
the
complex
and
so
in
this
part
of
it
the
changeling
belief
there
are
conceivably
more
of
such
elements
which
lend
some
support
to
the
kidnap
theory
in
itself
however
as
we
hope
to
show
conclusively
the
theory
failing
to
grasp
the
essential
and
underlying
character
of
this
belief
does
not
adequately
explain
it
alfred
nutt
advanced
a
theory
which
anticipated
one
part
of
our
own
that
changeling
story
is
found
to
be
connected
with
the
antique
conception
of
life
and
sacrifice
and
he
wrote
is
at
least
possible
that
the
sickly
and
ailing
would
be
rejected
when
the
time
came
for
each
family
to
supply
its
quota
of
victims
and
this
might
easily
translate
itself
in
the
into
the
statement
that
the
fairies
had
carried
off
the
healthy
alone
acceptable
as
sacrifice
left
in
exchange
the
sickly
though
our
evidence
will
not
permit
us
to
accept
the
theory
why
it
will
not
will
be
clear
as
we
proceed
that
some
such
sacrificial
customs
among
the
ancient
celts
entirely
account
for
the
changeling
story
yet
we
consider
it
highly
probable
that
the
theory
helps
to
explain
particular
aspects
of
the
complex
tradition
and
that
the
underlying
philosophy
of
sacrifice
extended
in
an
animistic
way
as
we
shall
try
to
extend
it
probably
offers
more
complete
explanation
thus
the
mexicans
believed
that
the
souls
of
all
sacrificed
children
went
to
live
with
the
god
tlaloc
in
his
among
the
greeks
a
sacrificed
victim
appears
to
have
been
sent
as
a
messenger
bearing
a
message
repeated
to
him
before
death
to
some
god
on
the
funeral
pile
of
patroclus
were
laid
trojan
captives
together
with
horses
and
hounds
a
practice
corresponding
to
that
of
american
red
men
the
idea
being
that
the
sacrificed
trojans
and
the
horses
and
hounds
as
well
were
thus
sent
to
serve
the
slain
warriors
in
the
otherworld
among
ourselves
in
europe
and
in
america
it
is
not
uncommon
to
read
in
the
daily
newspaper
about
a
suicide
as
resulting
from
the
belief
that
death
alone
can
bring
union
with
a
deceased
sweetheart
or
loved
one
these
examples
and
very
many
parallel
ones
to
be
found
the
world
over
seem
to
furnish
the
key
to
the
theory
of
sacrifice
namely
that
by
extinguishing
life
in
this
world
it
is
transmitted
to
the
world
of
the
gods
spirits
and
the
dead
both
sir
john
rhŷs
and
de
jubainville
have
shown
that
the
irish
were
wont
to
sacrifice
the
of
children
and
of
flocks
points
out
a
clear
case
of
human
sacrifice
at
an
ancient
irish
funeral
then
brought
fifty
hostages
with
him
from
munster
and
when
he
died
hostages
which
he
brought
from
the
south
were
buried
alive
around
the
burial
mound
of
fiachra
more
commonly
the
ancient
celts
seem
to
have
made
sacrifices
to
appease
before
the
erection
of
a
new
building
by
sending
to
them
through
death
the
soul
of
a
youth
see
it
is
in
such
animistic
beliefs
as
these
which
underlie
sacrifice
that
we
find
a
partial
solution
of
the
problem
of
changeling
belief
but
the
sacrifice
theory
is
also
inadequate
for
though
changelings
may
in
some
cases
in
ancient
times
have
conceivably
been
the
sickly
children
discarded
by
priests
as
unfit
for
sending
to
the
gods
or
fairies
how
can
we
explain
actual
changelings
to
be
met
with
in
all
celtic
lands
some
other
hypothesis
is
evidently
necessary
comparative
study
shows
that
changeling
beliefs
parallel
to
those
of
the
celts
exist
almost
everywhere
that
they
centre
round
the
primitive
idea
that
the
human
soul
can
be
abstracted
from
the
body
by
disembodied
spirits
and
by
magicians
and
that
they
do
not
depend
upon
the
sacrifice
theory
though
animistically
closely
related
to
it
for
example
according
to
the
lepers
islanders
ghosts
steal
men
as
fairies
do
add
them
to
their
company
and
if
a
man
has
left
children
when
he
died
one
of
whom
sickens
afterwards
it
is
said
that
the
dead
father
takes
it
in
banks
island
polynesia
the
ghost
of
a
woman
who
has
died
in
childbirth
is
greatly
dreaded
as
long
as
her
child
is
on
earth
she
can
not
proceed
to
panoi
the
otherworld
and
the
relatives
take
her
child
to
another
house
they
know
that
the
mother
will
come
back
to
take
its
soul
when
a
motlav
child
sneezes
the
mother
will
cry
him
come
back
into
the
world
let
him
remain
under
similar
circumstances
in
mota
the
cry
is
roll
back
to
us
notion
is
that
a
ghost
is
drawing
a
child
soul
away
if
the
child
falls
ill
the
attempt
has
succeeded
and
a
wizard
throws
himself
into
a
trance
and
goes
to
the
to
bring
the
child
soul
back
in
the
islands
of
kei
and
kisar
a
belief
prevails
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
can
take
to
themselves
the
souls
of
the
living
who
go
near
the
graves
sometimes
a
polynesian
mother
insists
on
being
buried
with
her
dead
child
or
a
surviving
wife
with
her
dead
husband
so
that
there
will
be
no
separation
these
last
practices
help
to
illustrate
the
celtic
theory
behind
the
belief
that
fairies
can
abduct
adults
throughout
melanesia
sickness
is
generally
attributed
to
the
absence
from
the
body
and
this
state
of
disembodiment
is
believed
to
be
due
to
some
ghost
or
spirit
interference
just
as
among
celts
sickness
is
often
thought
to
be
due
to
fairies
having
taken
the
soul
to
fairyland
an
old
irish
piper
who
came
up
to
lady
gregory
home
at
coole
park
told
us
that
a
certain
relative
of
his
a
woman
had
lain
in
a
state
of
illness
for
months
and
that
when
she
recovered
full
consciousness
she
declared
she
had
been
with
the
people
like
all
the
above
which
more
adequately
explain
the
changeling
idea
than
the
theory
are
being
at
once
celtic
and
there
has
been
among
many
peoples
primitive
and
civilized
a
complementary
belief
to
the
one
that
evil
spirits
or
ghosts
may
steal
a
soul
and
so
cause
in
the
vacated
body
illness
if
the
abduction
is
temporary
and
death
if
it
is
permanent
namely
a
belief
that
demons
who
sometimes
may
be
souls
of
the
dead
can
possess
a
human
body
while
the
soul
is
out
of
it
during
sleep
or
else
can
expel
the
soul
and
occupy
its
place
when
complete
possession
of
this
character
takes
place
there
is
as
in
a
change
of
personality
and
the
manner
thoughts
actions
language
and
the
whole
nature
of
the
possessed
person
are
radically
changed
sometimes
a
foreign
tongue
of
which
the
subject
is
ignorant
is
fluently
spoken
when
the
possession
is
an
evil
one
as
nevius
has
observed
in
china
where
the
phenomena
are
common
the
change
of
character
is
in
the
direction
of
immorality
frequently
in
strong
contrast
with
the
character
of
the
subject
under
normal
conditions
and
is
often
accompanied
by
paroxysms
and
contortions
of
the
body
as
i
have
often
been
solemnly
assured
by
celts
is
the
case
in
a
changeling
see
le
scour
account
on
page
of
three
changelings
that
he
saw
in
one
family
in
finistère
and
compare
what
is
said
about
fairy
changelings
in
ireland
scotland
isle
of
man
wales
and
cornwall
a
conception
like
that
among
the
chinese
of
how
an
evil
spirit
may
dispossess
the
soul
inhabiting
a
child
or
adult
body
seems
to
be
the
basis
and
original
conception
behind
the
belief
in
all
celtic
and
other
countries
when
a
child
has
been
changed
by
fairies
and
an
old
fairy
left
in
its
place
the
child
has
been
according
to
this
theory
dispossessed
of
its
body
by
an
evil
fairy
which
a
chinaman
calls
a
demon
while
the
leaving
behind
of
the
old
fairy
accounts
for
the
changed
personality
and

the

takes

of

body
while
the

soul
is

of
it
during

and
all
fairies
make

when
a
babe
is
asleep
in
its

for

is

until
some
kind
of

or
exorcism
expels
the
possessing
demon
and
through
precisely
similar
methods
often
aided
by
christian
priests
celts
cure
changelings
made
by
fairies
pixies
and
in
the
following
account
therefore
apparently
lies
the
root
explanation
of
the
puzzling
beliefs
concerning
fairy
changelings
so
commonly
met
with
in
the
celtic
avert
the
calamity
of
nursing
a
demon
dried
is
burnt
to
ashes
which
are
then
mixed
with
water
into

paints
a

upon
the
sleeping
babe
forehead
in
a
short
time
the
demon
soul
returns
for
the
soul
wanders
from
the
body
during
sleep
and
is
free
but
failing
to
recognize
the
body
thus
disguised
flies
off
the
true
soul
which
has
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
now
approaches
the
dormant
body
and
if
the
mark
has
been
washed
off
in
time
takes
possession
of
it
but
if
not
it
like
the
demon
failing
to
recognize
the
body
departs
and
the
child
dies
in
its
sleep
in
relation
to
this
theory
the
writer
has
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
carefully
some
living
changelings
among
the
celts
and
is
convinced
that
in
many
such
cases
there
is
an
undoubted
belief
expressed
by
the
parents
and
friends
that
has
taken
place
this
belief
often
translates
itself
naturally
into
the
that
the
body
of
the
child
has
also
been
changed
when
examination
proves
only
a
change
of
personality
as
recognized
by
psychologists
or
in
a
distinct
type
of
changelings
those
who
exhibit
great
precocity
in
childhood
combined
with
an
old
and
wizened
countenance
there
is
neither
a
changed
personality
nor
but
simply
some
abnormal
physical
or
mental
condition
in
the
nature
of
cretinism
atrophy
marasmus
or
arrested
development
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
a
changeling
exists
at
brittany
where
there
is
now
living
a
dwarf
breton
whom
i
have
photographed
and
talked
with
and
who
may
possibly
combine
in
himself
both
the
abnormal
psychical
and
the
abnormal
pathological
conditions
he
is
no
taller
than
a
normal
child
ten
years
old
but
being
over
thirty
years
old
he
is
though
not
deformed
all
the
peasants
who
know
him
call
him
little
and
his
own
mother
declares
that
he
is
not
the
child
she
gave
birth
to
he
once
said
to
me
with
a
kind
of
pathetic
protest
tell
you
that
i
am
a
demon
the
kidnap
theory
resting
entirely
upon
the
ethnological
and
social
or
psychological
elements
which
we
have
elsewhere
pointed
out
as
existing
in
the
superficial
aspects
of
the
essentially
animistic
as
a
whole
is
accordingly
limited
in
its
explanation
of
this
specialized
part
of
the
the
changeling
belief
to
these
same
elements
which
may
exist
in
the
changeling
belief
and
on
the
showing
of
anthropology
the
other
theories
undoubtedly
offer
a
more
adequate
explanation
by
means
of
sacrifice
according
to
its
underlying
philosophy
man
is
able
to
transmit
souls
from
this
world
to
the
world
where
dwell
the
gods
and
both
good
and
evil
thus
had
abraham
sacrificed
isaac
the
soul
of
isaac
would
have
been
taken
to
heaven
by
jehovah
as
fairies
take
souls
to
fairyland
through
death
but
the
difference
is
that
in
human
sacrifice
men
do
voluntarily
and
for
specific
religious
ends
what
various
kinds
of
fairies
or
spirits
would
do
without
human
intervention
and
often
maliciously
as
our
review
of
ancient
and
modern
theories
of
sacrifice
has
shown
gods
and
fairies
are
spiritual
beings
hence
only
the
spiritual
part
of
man
can
be
delivered
over
to
them
melanesians
and
other
peoples
whose
changeling
beliefs
have
now
been
examined
regard
all
illness
and
death
as
the
result
of
spirit
interference
while
celts
regard
strange
maladies
in
children
and
in
adults
as
the
result
of
fairy
interference
and
to
no
celt
is
death
in
early
life
a
natural
thing
if
it
comes
to
a
child
or
to
a
beautiful
youth
in
any
way
whatsoever
the
fairies
have
taken
what
they
coveted
in
all
mythologies
gods
have
always
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
beautiful
maidens
and
goddesses
the
love
of
heroic
youths
and
they
have
often
taken
them
to
their
world
as
the
tuatha
de
danann
took
the
great
heroes
of
the
ancient
celts
to
the
otherworld
or
avalon
and
as
they
still
in
the
character
of
modern
fairies
abduct
brides
and
young
mothers
and
bridegrooms
or
other
attractive
young
men
whom
they
wish
to
have
with
them
in
fairyland
see
our
chapters
where
sacrifice
or
death
has
not
brought
about
such
complete
transfer
or
abduction
of
the
soul
to
the
fairy
world
there
is
only
a
temporary
absence
from
human
society
and
meanwhile
the
vacated
body
is
under
a
fairy
spell
and
lies
ill
or
unconscious
if
there
is
a
trance
state
if
the
body
is
an
infant
a
fairy
may
possess
it
as
in
the
chinese
theory
of
in
such
cases
the
celts
often
think
that
the
living
body
is
that
of
another
child
once
but
since
grown
too
old
for
fairyland
though
the
rational
explanation
frequently
is
purely
pathological
looked
at
philosophically
a
fairy
exchange
of
this
kind
is
fair
and
evenly
balanced
and
there
has
been
no
true
robbery
and
in
this
aspect
of
the
changeling
creed
an
aspect
of
it
purely
celtic
there
seems
to
be
still
another
influence
apart
from
human
sacrifice
demon
or
and
disease
namely
a
greatly
corrupted
of
an
ancient
doctrine
the
living
are
taken
to
the
dead
or
the
fairies
and
then
sent
back
again
after
the
manner
of
socrates
argument
that
the
living
come
from
the
dead
and
the
dead
from
the
living
cf
our
chapter
vii
in
all
such
exchanges
the
economy
of
nature
demands
that
the
balance
between
the
two
worlds
be
maintained
hence
there
arose
the
theories
of
human
sacrifice
of
soul
abduction
of
demon
or
and
in
all
these
collectively
is
to
be
found
the
complete
psychological
explanation
of
the
and
beliefs
among
ancient
and
modern
celts
as
these
show
themselves
in
the
all
remaining
classes
of
changelings
which
fall
outside
the
scope
of
this
clearly
defined
psychological
theory
are
to
be
explained
pathologically
magic
and
witchcraft
the
evidence
from
each
celtic
country
shows
very
clearly
that
magic
and
witchcraft
are
inseparably
blended
in
the
and
that
human
beings
and
other
magicians
and
sorceresses
are
often
enabled
through
the
aid
of
fairies
to
perform
the
same
magical
acts
as
fairies
or
again
like
christian
priests
who
use
exorcisms
they
are
able
acting
independently
to
counteract
fairy
power
thereby
preventing
changelings
or
curing
them
saving
churnings
healing
man
or
beast
of
and
in
short
nullifying
all
undesirable
influences
emanating
from
the
fairy
world
a
correct
interpretation
of
these
magical
elements
so
prominent
in
the
is
of
fundamental
importance
because
if
made
it
will
set
us
on
one
of
the
main
psychical
highways
which
traverse
the
vast
territory
of
our
anthropological
inquiry
let
us
then
undertake
such
an
interpretation
first
setting
up
as
we
must
some
sort
of
working
hypothesis
as
to
what
magic
is
witchcraft
being
assumed
to
be
a
part
of
magic
of
modern
we
may
define
magic
as
understood
by
ancients
and
moderns
civilized
or
apart
from
conjuring
which
is
mere
jugglery
and
deception
of
the
senses
as
the
art
of
controlling
for
particular
ends
various
kinds
of
invisible
forces
often
and
as
we
hold
generally
thought
of
as
intelligent
spirits
this
is
somewhat
opposed
to
marett
point
of
view
which
emphasizes
influences
to
which
the
animistic
form
is
very
vaguely
attributed
if
at
all
and
in
dealing
with
the
anthropological
aspects
of
in
magical
operations
marett
conceives
such
a
magical
act
to
be
in
relation
to
the
magician
a
projection
of
imperative
will
and
specifically
one
that
moves
on
a
supernormal
plane
and
the
victim
position
towards
this
invisible
projected
force
to
be
position
compatible
with
he
also
thinks
it
probable
that
the
essence
of
the
magician
supernormal
power
lies
in
what
melanesians
call
in
our
opinion
may
be
equated
with
what
william
james
writing
of
his
attitude
toward
psychical
phenomena
called
a
universally
diffused
leaking
through
so
to
speak
and
expressing
itself
in
the
human
individual
on
this
view
marett
theory
would
amount
to
saying
that
magicians
are
able
to
produce
magical
effects
because
they
are
able
to
control
this
and
our
evidence
would
regard
all
spirits
and
fairies
as
portions
of
such
universally
diffused
or
as
fechner
might
call
it
the
of
the
world
moreover
in
essence
such
an
idea
of
magic
coincides
when
carefully
examined
with
what
ancient
thinkers
like
plato
iamblichus
the
generally
and
mediaeval
magicians
like
paracelsus
and
eliphas
levi
called
magic
and
agrees
with
ancient
celtic
magic
judging
from
what
roman
historians
have
recorded
concerning
it
and
from
celtic
manuscripts
themselves
other
modern
anthropologists
have
set
up
far
less
satisfactory
definitions
of
magic
according
to
frazer
for
example
magic
assumes
as
natural
science
does
that
event
follows
another
necessarily
and
invariably
without
the
intervention
of
any
spiritual
or
personal
agency
such
a
theory
is
not
supported
by
the
facts
of
anthropology
and
does
not
even
apply
to
those
specialized
and
often
superficial
kinds
of
magic
classed
under
it
by
frazer
as
and
imitative
magic
that
through
which
like
produces
like
or
part
produces
whole
to
our
mind
sympathetic
and
imitative
magic
to
leave
out
of
account
many
fallacious
and
irrational
ritualistic
practices
which
frazer
includes
under
these
loose
terms
in
their
varied
aspects
are
directly
dependent
upon
hypnotic
states
upon
telepathy
mental
suggestion
association
of
ideas
and
similar
processes
in
short
are
due
to
the
operation
of
mind
on
mind
and
will
on
will
and
moreover
are
recognized
by
primitive
races
to
have
this
fundamental
character
or
according
to
the
they
are
caused
by
a
fairy
or
disembodied
spirit
acting
upon
an
embodied
one
a
man
or
woman
and
not
as
frazer
holds
through
applications
of
one
or
other
of
two
great
fundamental
laws
of
thought
namely
the
association
of
ideas
by
similarity
and
the
association
of
ideas
by
contiguity
in
space
or
time
the
mechanical
causation
theory
of
magic
as
thus
set
forth
in
golden
does
not
imply
or
as
marett
more
adequate
theory
does
in
part
frazer
wishes
us
to
regard
animistic
religious
practices
as
distinct
from
magic
nevertheless
in
direct
opposition
to
frazer
view
the
weight
of
the
evidence
from
the
past
and
from
the
present
which
we
are
about
to
offer
is
decidedly
favourable
to
our
regarding
magic
and
religion
as
complementary
to
one
another
and
for
all
ordinary
purposes
of
the
anthropologist
as
in
principle
the
same
the
testimony
touching
magicians
in
all
ages
celtic
magic
and
witchcraft
as
well
besides
that
resulting
from
modern
psychical
research
tends
to
establish
an
almost
exclusively
animistic
hypothesis
to
account
for
fairy
magical
phenomena
and
like
phenomena
among
human
beings
and
with
these
phenomena
we
are
solely
concerned
the
among
the
more
cultured
greeks
and
romans
and
the
same
can
be
said
of
most
great
nations
of
antiquity
it
was
an
unquestioned
belief
that
innumerable
gods
placed
in
hierarchies
form
part
of
an
unbroken
spiritual
chain
at
the
lowest
end
of
which
stands
man
and
at
the
highest
the
incomprehensible
supreme
deity
these
gods
having
their
abodes
throughout
the
universe
act
as
the
agents
of
the
unknown
god
directing
the
operation
of
his
cosmic
laws
and
animating
every
star
and
planet
inferior
to
these
gods
and
to
man
also
the
ancients
believed
there
to
be
innumerable
hosts
of
invisible
beings
called
by
them
daemons
who
acting
as
the
servants
of
the
gods
control
and
thus
in
a
secondary
sense
create
all
the
minor
phenomena
of
inanimate
and
animate
nature
such
as
tempests
atmospheric
disturbances
generally
the
failure
of
crops
or
their
abundance
maladies
and
their
cure
good
and
evil
passions
in
men
wars
and
peace
and
all
the
blessings
and
curses
which
affect
the
purely
human
life
man
being
of
the
and
thus
superior
to
these
lower
servile
entities
could
like
the
gods
control
them
if
adept
in
the
magical
sciences
for
ancient
magic
about
which
so
much
has
been
written
and
about
which
so
little
has
been
understood
by
most
people
in
ancient
mediaeval
and
modern
times
is
according
to
the
wisest
ancients
nothing
more
than
the
controlling
of
daemons
shades
and
all
sorts
of
secondary
spirits
or
elementals
by
men
specially
trained
for
that
purpose
sufficient
records
are
extant
to
make
it
evident
that
the
fundamental
training
of
egyptian
indian
assyrian
greek
roman
and
druid
priests
was
in
the
magical
or
occult
sciences
pliny
in
his
says
britain
practises
the
art
of
magic
with
religious
awe
and
with
so
many
ceremonies
that
it
might
seem
to
have
made
the
art
known
to
the
persians
herein
then
is
direct
evidence
that
the
celtic
considered
in
its
true
psychic
nature
has
been
immediately
shaped
by
the
ancient
celtic
religion
and
as
our
witness
from
the
isle
of
skye
so
clearly
set
forth
that
it
originated
among
a
cultured
class
of
the
celts
more
than
among
the
peasants
and
in
accordance
with
this
evidence
professor
georges
dottin
who
has
made
a
special
study
of
the
historical
records
concerning
druidism
writes
druids
of
ireland
appear
to
us
above
all
as
magicians
and
prophets
they
foretell
the
future
they
interpret
the
secret
will
of
the
fairies
they
cast
lots
thus
in
spite
of
the
popular
and
christian
reshaping
which
the
belief
in
fairies
has
had
to
endure
its
origin
is
easily
enough
discerned
even
in
its
modern
form
covered
over
though
this
is
with
accretions
foreign
to
its
primal
character
magic
was
the
supreme
science
because
it
raised
its
adepts
out
of
the
ordinary
levels
of
humanity
to
a
close
relationship
with
the
gods
and
creative
powers
nor
was
it
a
science
to
be
had
for
the
asking
many
were
the
and
few
the
chosen
roman
writers
tell
us
that
neophytes
for
the
druidic
priesthood
often
spent
twenty
years
in
severe
study
and
training
before
being
deemed
fit
to
be
called
druids
we
need
not
however
in
this
study
enter
into
an
exposition
of
the
ordeals
and
trials
of
candidates
seeking
magical
training
or
else
initiation
into
the
mysteries
there
were
always
two
schools
to
which
they
could
apply
directly
opposed
in
their
government
and
policy
the
school
of
white
magic
and
the
school
of
black
magic
the
former
being
a
school
in
which
magical
powers
were
used
in
religious
rites
and
always
for
good
ends
the
latter
a
school
in
which
all
magical
powers
were
used
for
wholly
selfish
and
evil
ends
in
both
schools
the
preliminary
training
was
the
same
that
is
to
say
the
first
thing
taught
to
the
neophyte
was
when
he
proved
himself
absolutely
his
own
master
when
his
teachers
were
certain
that
he
could
not
be
dominated
by
another
will
or
by
any
outside
or
psychic
influence
then
for
the
first
time
he
was
permitted
to
exercise
his
own
iron
will
in
controlling
daemons
ghosts
and
all
the
elemental
hosts
of
the
air
either
as
a
white
magician
or
as
a
black
magician
the
magical
sciences
taught
an
idea
which
still
holds
its
ground
as
one
can
discover
in
modern
india
that
by
formulas
of
invocation
by
chants
by
magic
sounds
by
music
these
invisible
beings
can
be
made
to
obey
the
will
of
the
magician
even
as
they
obey
the
will
of
the
gods
the
calling
up
of
the
dead
and
talking
with
them
is
called
necromancy
the
foretelling
through
spiritual
agency
and
otherwise
of
coming
events
or
things
hidden
like
the
outcome
of
a
battle
is
called
divination
the
employment
of
charms
against
children
so
as
to
prevent
their
growing
is
known
as
fascination
to
cause
any
ill
fortune
or
death
to
fall
upon
another
person
by
magic
is

magical
mixtures
called
philtres
are
used
almost
all
these
definitions
apply
to
the
practices
of
black
magic
but
the
great
schools
known
as
the
mysteries
were
of
white
magic
in
so
far
as
they
practised
the
art
and
such
men
as
pythagoras
plato
and
aeschylus
who
are
supposed
to
have
been
initiated
into
them
always
held
them
in
the
highest
reverence
though
prohibited
from
directly
communicating
anything
of
their
esoteric

concerning
the

and

in

the

or

of

in

is
explained
socrates
asks
of
the
prophetess
diotima
what
is
the
power
of
the
daemonic
element
personified
as

for
the
purposes
of

and
she
replies

and
taking
across

the

the
prayers
and

of

and
to

and

of

gods
he
is

who
spans
the
chasm
which
divides

and
therefore
in
him
all
is
bound
together
and
through
him
the
arts
of
the
prophets
and

their
sacrifices
and

and
charms
and
all
prophecy
and
incantation
find
their

for

but
through
the
daemonic
element
or
love
all
the
intercourse
and
converse
of
god
with
man
whether
awake
or
asleep
is
carried
on
the
wisdom
which
understands
this
is
spiritual
the
ancient
if
we
turn
now
directly
to
celtic
magic
in
ancient
times
we
discover
that
the
testimony
of
pliny
is
curiously
confirmed
by
celtic
manuscripts
chiefly
irish
ones
and
that
then
as
now
witchcraft
and
fairy
powers
over
men
and
women
are
indistinguishable
in
their
general
character
thus
in
the
adventures
of
connla
the
fairy
woman
says
of
druidism
and
magic
is
not
loved
little
has
it
progressed
to
honour
on
the
great
strand
when
his
law
shall
come
it
will
scatter
the
charms
of
druids
journeying
on
the
lips
of
black
lying
so
characterized
by
the
christian
transcribers
in
fionn
found
his
missing
an
ancient
tale
preserved
by
oral
tradition
until
recorded
by
campbell
it
is
said
that
then
went
out
with
bran
his
fairy
dog
there
were
millions
of
people
apparitions
out
before
him
called
up
by
some
sleight
of
hand
in
the
na
or
of
the
dun
cow
a
compiled
from
older
manuscripts
about
there
is
a
clear
example
of
irish
fetishism
based
on
belief
in
the
power
of
demons
for
their
swords
used
to
turn
against
them
the
ulstermen
when
they
made
a
false
trophy
reasonable
was
this
for
demons
used
to
speak
to
them
from
their
arms
so
that
hence
their
arms
were
safeguards
quite
after
the
fairy
fashion
is
very
frequently
met
with
in
old
celtic
literature
thus
in
the
rennes
there
is
this
passage
showing
that
spirits
or
fairies
were
regarded
as
necessary
for
the
employment
of
magic
were
envious
of
them
faifne
the
poet
and
his
sister
aige
so
they
loosed
elves
at
them
who
transformed
aige
into
a
fawn
the
form
assumed
by
the
fairy
mother
of
oisin
see
sent
her
on
a
circuit
all
round
ireland
and
the
fians
of
meilge
son
of
cobthach
king
of
ireland
killed
her
a
fact
which
ought
to
be
noted
in
this
connexion
is
that
kings
or
great
heroes
rather
than
ordinary
men
and
women
are
very
commonly
described
as
being
able
to
shift
their
own
shape
or
that
of
other
people
took
on
himself
the
shape
of
tibraide
and
gave
mac
an
daimh
the
shape
of
the
cleric
with
a
large
tonsure
on
his
head
and
when
this
fact
is
coupled
with
another
namely
the
ancient
belief
that
such
kings
and
great
heroes
were
incarnations
and
reincarnations
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
who
form
the
supreme
fairy
hierarchy
we
realize
that
having
such
an
origin
they
were
simply
exercising
in
human
bodies
powers
which
their
divine
race
exercise
over
men
from
the
fairy
world
see
our
chapter
iv
in
brythonic
literature
and
mythology
magic
and
witchcraft
with
the
same
animistic
character
play
as
great
or
even
a
greater
rôle
than
in
gaelic
literature
and
mythology
this
is
especially
true
with
respect
to
the
arthurian
legend
and
to
the
some
of
which
tales
are
regarded
by
scholars
as
versions
of
irish
ones
sir
john
rhŷs
and
professor
loth
who
have
been
the
chief
translators
of
the
consider
their
chief
literary
machinery
to
be
magic
see
our
chapter
v
so
far
it
ought
to
be
clear
that
celtic
magic
contains
much
animism
in
its
composition
and
that
these
few
illustrations
of
it
selected
from
numerous
illustrations
in
the
ancient
confirm
independent
testimony
that
in
his
age
the
britons
seemed
capable
of
instructing
even
the
persians
themselves
in
the
magical
arts
and
american
in
a
general
way
the
history
of
witchcraft
in
europe
and
in
the
american
colonies
is
supplementary
to
what
has
already
been
said
seeing
that
it
is
an
offshoot
of
mediaeval
magic
which
in
turn
is
an
offshoot
of
ancient
magic
witchcraft
in
the
west
in
probably
a
majority
of
cases
is
a
mere
fabric
of
absurd
superstitions
and
practices
as
it
is
shown
to
be
by
the
evidence
brought
out
in
so
many
of
the
horrible
legal
and
ecclesiastical
processes
conducted
against
helpless
and
eccentric
old
people
and
other
men
and
women
including
the
young
often
for
the
sake
of
private
revenge
and
generally
on
no
better
foundation
than
hearsay
and
false
accusations
in
the
remaining
instances
it
undoubtedly
arose
as
ancient
witchcraft
black
magic
seems
to
have
arisen
through
the
infiltration
of
occult
knowledge
into
uneducated
and
often
criminally
inclined
minds
so
that
what
had
formerly
been
secretly
guarded
among
the
learned
and
generally
used
for
legitimate
ends
degenerated
in
the
hands
of
the
unfit
into
black
magic
in
our
own
age
a
parallel
development
which
adequately
illustrates
our
subject
of
inquiry
has
taken
place
in
the
united
states
fragments
of
magical
lore
bequeathed
by
mesmer
and
his
immediate
predecessors
the
alchemists
were
practically
and
honestly
applied
to
the
practice
of
magnetic
healing
and
healing
through
mental
suggestion
by
a
small
group
of
practitioners
in
massachusetts
and
then
with
much
ingenuity
and
real
genius
were
applied
by
mary
baker
eddy
to
the
interpretation
of
miraculous
healing
by
jesus
christ
hence
arose
a
new
religion
called
christian
science
but
this
religious
movement
did
not
stop
at
mental
healing
according
to
published
reports
during
the
years
the
leader
of
the
new
york
first
church
of
christ
scientist
was
deposed
and
with
certain
of
her
close
associates
was
charged
with
having
projected
daily
against
the
late
eddy
adjutant
a
current
of
animal
magnetism
from
new
york
to
boston
in
order
to
bring
about
his
death
the
process
is
said
to
have
been
for
the
deposed
leader
and
her
friends
to
sit
together
in
a
darkened
room
with
their
eyes
closed
one
of
them
would
say
you
all
know
you
all
know
that
his
place
is
in
the
darkness
whence
he
came
if
his
place
is
six
feet
under
ground
that
is
where
he
should
be
then
all
present
would
concentrate
their
minds
on
the
one
thought
and
six
feet
under
ground
and
this
practice
is
supposed
to
have
been
kept
up
for
days
who
gives
this
testimony
is
a
friend
of
the
victim
and
she
asserts
that
these
evil
slowly
but
surely
began
his
effacement
and
that
had
the
black
magicians
down
in
new
york
not
been
discovered
in
time
could
not
have
withstood
the
forces
perhaps
so
enlightened
a
country
as
the
united
states
may
in
time
see
history
repeat
itself
and
add
a
new
chapter
to
witchcraft
for
the
true
witches
were
not
the
kind
who
are
popularly
supposed
to
ride
on
broomsticks
and
to
keep
a
house
full
of
black
cats
and
the
sooner
this
is
recognized
the
better
according
to
this
aspect
of
christian
science
animal
magnetism
or
black
magic
an
embodied
spirit
a
man
or
woman
possesses
and
can
employ
the
same
magical
powers
as
a
disembodied
spirit
or
as
the
celts
would
say
the
same
magical
powers
as
a
fairy
casting
spells
and
producing
disease
and
death
in
the
victim
and
this
view
coincides
with
ordinary
witchcraft
theories
for
witches
have
been
variously
defined
as
embodied
spirits
who
have
ability
to
act
in
conjunction
with
disembodied
spirits
through
the
employment
of
various
occult
forces
forces
comparable
to
mesmer
odic
forces
to
the
melanesian
or
to
the
postulated
by
william
james
or
as
celts
think
to
forces
focused
in
fairies
themselves
so
also
according
to
marett
view
there
is
a
state
of
between
the
victim
and
the
magician
or
witch
and
where
such
a
state
of
exists
there
is
some
force
passing
between
the
two
poles
of
the
magical
circuit
whether
it
be
only
unconscious
mental
or
electrical
force
emanating
from
the
operator
or
an
extraneous
force
brought
under
control
and
concentrated
in
some
such
conscious
unit
as
we
designate
by
the
term
or
in
conformity
with
this
psychical
or
animistic
view
of
witchcraft
in
the
capital
code
of
connecticut
a
witch
is
defined
as
one
who
or
consorteth
with
a
familiar
spirit
european
codes
as
illustrated
by
the
sixth
chapter
of
lord
coke
have
parallels
to
this
definition
witch
is
a
person
which
hath
conference
with
the
devil
to
consult
with
him
to
do
some
act
and
upon
these
theories
not
upon
the
broomstick
and
conception
were
based
the
trials
for
witchcraft
during
the
seventeenth
century
the
bible
then
so
frequently
the
last
court
of
appeal
in
such
matters
was
found
to
sustain
such
theories
about
witches
in
the
classical
example
of
the
witch
of
endor
and
saul
and
the
idea
of
witchcraft
in
europe
and
america
came
to
be
based
as
it
probably
always
had
been
in
pagan
times
on
the
theory
that
living
persons
could
control
or
be
controlled
by
disembodied
spirits
for
evil
ends
hence
all
black
magicians
and
what
are
now
known
as
mediums
were
made
liable
by
law
to
the
death
penalty
in
mediaeval
europe
the
great
difficulty
always
was
as
is
shown
in
the
trials
of
jeanne
to
decide
whether
the
invisible
agent
in
magical
processes
such
as
was
imputed
to
the
accused
was
an
angel
or
a
demon
if
an
angel
then
the
accused
was
a
saint
and
might
become
a
candidate
for
canonization
but
if
a
demon
the
accused
was
a
witch
and
liable
to
a
the
wisest
old
doctors
of
the
university
of
paris
who
sat
in
judgement
or
were
consulted
in
one
of
jeanne
trials
could
not
fully
decide
this
knotty
problem
nor
apparently
the
learned
churchmen
who
also
tried
her
but
evidently
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
better
to
waive
the
question
and
finally
an
innocent
peasant
girl
who
had
heard
divine
voices
and
who
had
thereby
miraculously
saved
her
king
and
her
country
was
burned
at
the
stake
under
the
joint
direction
of
english
civil
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
and
if
not
technically
at
least
practically
with
the
full
approval
of
the
corresponding
french
authorities
at
rouen
france
may
d
in
april
almost
five
centuries
afterwards
it
has
been
decided
with
tardy
justice
that
jeanne
voices
were
those
of
angels
and
not
of
demons
and
she
has
been
made
a
saint
how
the
case
of
jeanne
bears
directly
upon
the
is
one
of
the
first
questions
asked
by
jeanne
inquisitors
was
she
had
any
knowledge
of
those
who
went
to
the
sabbath
with
the
fairies
or
if
she
had
not
assisted
at
the
assemblies
held
at
the
fountain
of
the
fairies
near
domremy
around
which
dance
malignant
spirits
and
another
question
exactly
as
recorded
was
this
croiet
point
au
devant
de
aujourduy
que
les
fées
feussent
maulvais
esperis
respond
sçavoit
finally
we
may
say
that
what
are
to
american
indians
to
polynesians
australians
africans
eskimos
and
many
other
contemporary
races
or
what
the
mightier
magicians
of
modern
india
are
to
their
people
the
and
of
ireland
scotland
and
man
are
to
the
gaels
and
the
or
men
of
wales
the
witches
of
cornwall
and
the
seers
sorceresses
and
exorcists
of
brittany
are
to
the
brythons
these
gaelic
and
brythonic
magicians
and
witches
and
mediums
almost
invariably
claim
to
derive
their
power
from
their
ability
to
see
and
to
communicate
with
fairies
spirits
and
the
dead
and
they
generally
say
that
they
are
enabled
through
such
spiritual
agencies
to
reveal
the
past
to
foretell
the
future
to
locate
lost
property
to
cast
spells
upon
human
beings
and
upon
animals
to
remove
such
spells
to
cure
fairy
strokes
and
changelings
to
perform
exorcisms
and
to
bring
people
back
from
fairyland
we
arrive
at
the
following
conclusion
if
as
eminent
psychical
researchers
now
postulate
and
as
many
of
them
believe
there
are
active
and
intelligent
disembodied
beings
able
to
act
psychically
upon
embodied
men
in
much
the
same
way
that
embodied
men
are
known
ordinarily
to
act
psychically
upon
one
another
then
there
is
every
logical
and
reason
for
extending
this
psychical
hypothesis
so
as
to
include
the
ancient
mediaeval
and
modern
theory
of
magic
and
witchcraft
namely
that
what
embodied
men
and
women
can
do
in
magical
ways
as
for
example
in
hypnotism
disembodied
men
and
women
can
do
further
if
fairies
in
accord
with
reliable
testimony
from
educated
and
critical
percipients
hypothetically
exist
whatever
their
nature
may
be
they
may
be
possessed
of
magical
powers
of
the
same
sort
and
so
can
cast
spells
upon
or
possess
living
human
beings
as
celts
believe
and
assert
and
this
hypothesis
coincides
in
most
essentials
with
the
one
we
used
as
a
basis
for
this
discussion
that
in
accordance
with
the
melanesian
doctrine
of
control
of
ghosts
and
spirits
with
their
inherent
magical
acts
are
possible
this
in
turn
applied
to
the
celts
amounts
to
a
hypothetical
confirmation
of
the
ancient
druidical
doctrine
that
through
control
of
fairies
or
demons
daemons
druids
or
magicians
could
control
the
weather
and
natural
phenomena
connected
with
vegetable
and
animal
processes
could
cast
spells
could
divine
the
future
could
execute
all
magical
acts
exorcisms
according
to
the
testimony
of
anthropology
exorcism
as
a
religious
practice
has
always
flourished
wherever
animistic
beliefs
have
furnished
it
with
the
necessary
environment
and
not
only
has
exorcism
been
a
fundamental
part
of
religious
practices
in
past
ages
but
it
is
so
at
the
present
day
among
christians
celtic
and
among
followers
of
all
the
great
historical
religions
and
especially
among
east
indians
chinese
american
red
men
polynesians
and
most
africans
the
expelling
of
demons
from
men
and
women
from
animals
from
inanimate
objects
and
from
places
is
sanctioned
by
rituals
exorcism
as
applied
to
the
human
race
is
thus
defined
in
the
de
roman
catholic
by
bergier
conjuration
prayer
to
god
and
command
given
to
the
demon
to
depart
from
the
body
of
persons
possessed
the
same
authority
thus
logically
defends
its
practice
by
the
church
from
condemning
the
opinion
of
the
jews
who
attributed
to
the
demon
certain
maladies
that
divine
master
confirmed
it
and
whenever
exorcism
of
this
character
has
been
or
is
now
generally
practised
the
professional
exorcist
appears
as
a
personage
just
as
necessary
to
society
as
the
modern
doctor
since
nearly
all
diseases
were
and
to
some
extent
are
still
both
among
christians
and
very
often
thought
to
be
the
result
of
when
we
come
to
the
dawn
of
the
christian
period
in
ireland
and
in
scotland
we
see
patrick
and
columba
the
first
and
greatest
of
the
gaelic
missionaries
very
extensively
practising
exorcism
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
though
the
data
available
on
this
point
are
somewhat
unsatisfactory
that
their
wide
practice
of
exorcism
was
quite
as
much
a
christian
adaptation
of
celtic
exorcism
such
as
the
druids
practised
as
it
was
a
continuation
of
new
testament
tradition
we
may
now
present
certain
of
the
data
which
tend
to
verify
this
supposition
and
by
means
of
them
we
shall
be
led
to
realize
how
fundamentally
such
an
animistic
practice
as
exorcism
must
have
shaped
the
of
the
celts
both
before
and
after
the
coming
of
christianity
upon
a
time
so
the
tale
runs
about
patrick
went
to
milk
the
cow
he
also
went
with
her
to
drink
a
draught
of
new
milk
then
the
cow
goes
mad
in
the
byre
and
killed
five
other
kine
a
demon
namely
entered
her
there
was
great
sadness
on
his
and
she
told
him
to
bring
the
kine
back
to
life
then
he
brought
the
kine
to
life
so
that
they
were
whole
and
he
cured
the
mad
one
so
god
name
and
patrick
were
magnified
thereby
on
another
occasion
when
demons
came
to
ireland
in
the
form
of
black
birds
quite
after
the
manner
of
the
irish
belief
that
fairies
assume
the
form
of
crows
see
pp
the
celtic
ire
of
patrick
was
so
aroused
in
trying
to
exorcize
them
out
of
the
country
that
he
threw
his
bell
at
them
with
such
violence
that
it
was
cracked
and
then
he
wept
at
the
end
of
those
forty
days
and
forty
nights
of
patrick
long
fast
on
the
summit
of
cruachan
aigle
or
croagh
patrick
ireland
holy
mountain
mountain
was
filled
with
black
birds
so
that
he
knew
not
heaven
or
earth
he
sang
maledictive
psalms
at
them
they
left
him
not
because
of
this
then
his
anger
grew
against
them
he
strikes
his
bell
at
them
so
that
the
men
of
ireland
heard
its
voice
and
he
flung
it
at
them
so
that
a
gap
broke
out
of
it
and
that
bell
is
brigit
gapling
then
patrick
weeps
till
his
face
and
his
chasuble
in
front
of
him
were
wet
no
demon
came
to
the
land
of
erin
after
that
till
the
end
of
seven
years
and
seven
months
and
seven
days
and
seven
nights
then
the
angel
went
to
console
patrick
and
cleansed
the
chasuble
and
brought
white
birds
round
the
rick
and
they
used
to
sing
sweet
melodies
for
him
in
adamnan
of
it
is
said
that
to
custom
which
in
all
probability
was
established
in
pagan
times
by
the
druids
and
then
maintained
by
their
christian
descendants
it
was
usual
to
exorcize
even
a
milk
vessel
before
milking
and
the
milk
in
it
afterwards
thus
adamnan
tells
us
that
one
day
a
youth
columban
by
name
when
he
had
finished
milking
went
to
the
door
of
columba
cell
carrying
the
pail
full
of
new
milk
that
to
the
saint
might
exorcize
it
when
the
holy
man
had
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
the
air
the
air
greatly
agitated
and
the
bar
of
the
lid
driven
through
its
two
holes
was
shot
away
to
some
distance
the
lid
fell
to
the
ground
and
most
of
the
milk
was
spilled
on
the
soil
then
the
saint
chided
the
youth
saying
hast
done
carelessly
in
thy
work
for
thou
hast
not
cast
out
the
demon
that
was
lurking
in
the
bottom
of
the
empty
pail
by
tracing
on
it
before
pouring
in
the
milk
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
now
not
enduring
thou
seest
the
virtue
of
the
sign
he
has
quickly
fled
away
in
terror
while
at
the
same
time
the
whole
of
the
vessel
has
been
violently
shaken
and
the
milk
spilled
bring
then
the
pail
nearer
to
me
that
i
may
bless
it
when
the
pail
was
blessed
in
the
same
moment
it
was
refilled
with
milk
at
another
time
the
saint
to
destroy
the
practice
of
sorcery
commanded
silnan
a
peasant
sorcerer
to
draw
a
vessel
full
of
milk
from
a
bull
and
by
his
diabolical
art
silnan
drew
the
milk
then
columba
took
it
and
said
it
shall
be
proved
that
this
which
is
supposed
to
be
true
milk
is
not
so
but
is
blood
deprived
of
its
colour
by
the
fraud
of
demons
to
deceive
men
and
straightway
the
milky
colour
was
turned
into
its
own
proper
quality
that
is
into
blood
and
it
is
added
that
bull
also
which
for
the
space
of
one
hour
was
at
death
door
wasting
and
worn
by
a
horrible
emaciation
in
being
sprinkled
with
water
blessed
by
the
saint
was
cured
with
wonderful
rapidity
and
as
in
the
times
of
patrick
and
columba
exorcism
is
practised
in
ireland
and
in
the
western
hebrides
of
scotland
by
the
clergy
of
the
roman
church
against
fairies
demons
or
evil
spirits
when
a
person
is
possessed
by
them
that
is
to
say
or
when
they
have
entered
into
some
house
or
place
and
on
the
scotch
mainland
individual
protestants
have
been
known
to
practise
it
a
haunted
house
at
balechan
perthshire
in
which
certain
members
of
the
psychical
research
society
had
taken
up
summer
quarters
to
was
exorcized
by
the
late
archbishop
of
edinburgh
assisted
by
a
priest
from
the
outer
isles
among
the
nine
orders
of
the
irish
ecclesiastical
organization
of
patrick
time
one
was
composed
of
exorcists
the
official
ceremony
for
the
ordination
of
an
exorcist
in
the
latin
church
was
established
by
the
fourth
council
of
carthage
and
is
indicated
in
nearly
all
the
ancient
rituals
it
consists
in
the
bishop
giving
to
the
candidate
the
book
of
exorcisms
and
saying
as
he
does
so
and
understand
this
book
and
have
the
power
of
laying
hands
upon
demoniacs
whether
they
be
baptized
or
whether
they
be
catechumens
by
a
decree
of
the
church
council
of
orange
making
men
possessed
of
a
demon
ineligible
to
enter
the
priesthood
it
would
seem
that
the
number
of
demoniacs
must
have
been
very
great
as
to
the
efficacy
of
exorcisms
the
church
fathers
during
the
first
four
centuries
when
the
platonic
philosophy
was
most
influential
in
christianity
are
agreed
in
estimating
the
shaping
influences
designated
by
us
as
fundamental
which
undoubtedly
were
exerted
upon
the
through
the
practice
of
exorcism
it
is
necessary
to
realize
that
this
animistic
practice
holds
a
very
important
position
in
the
christian
religion
which
for
centuries
the
celtic
peoples
have
professed
one
of
the
two
chief
sacraments
of
christianity
that
of
baptism
is
preceded
by
a
definitely
recognized
exorcism
as
shown
in
the
roman
ritual
where
we
can
best
study
it
in
the
exhortation
preceding
the
rite
the
infant
is
called
a
slave
of
the
demon
and
by
baptism
is
to
be
set
free
the
salt
which
is
placed
in
the
mouth
of
the
infant
by
the
priest
during
the
ceremony
has
first
been
exorcized
by
special
rites
then
there
follows
before
the
entrance
to
the
baptismal
font
a
regular
exorcism
pronounced
over
the
child
the
priest
taking
some
of
his
own
saliva
on
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
touches
the
child
ears
and
nostrils
and
commands
the
demon
to
depart
out
of
the
child
after
this
part
of
the
ceremony
is
finished
the
priest
makes
on
the
child
forehead
a
sign
of
the
cross
with
holy
oil
finally
in
due
order
comes
the
actual
baptism
and
even
after
baptismal
rites
have
expelled
all
possessing
demons
precautions
are
necessary
against
a
repossession
augustine
has
said
that
exorcisms
of
precaution
ought
to
be
performed
over
every
christian
daily
and
it
appears
that
faithful
roman
catholics
who
each
day
employ
holy
water
in
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
all
protestants
who
pray
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
are
employing
such
exorcisms
gregory
of
nazianzus
writes
yourself
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
which
the
demons
fear
and
before
which
they
take
their
flight
and
by
the
same
sign
said
athanasius
the
illusions
of
the
demon
are
dissipated
and
all
his
snares
destroyed
an
eminent
catholic
theologian
asserts
that
saints
who
since
the
time
of
jesus
christ
have
been
endowed
with
the
power
of
working
miracles
have
always
made
use
of
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
driving
out
demons
in
curing
maladies
and
in
raising
the
dead
in
the
sur
le
it
is
said
that
water
which
has
been
blessed
is
particularly
designed
to
be
used
against
demons
in
the
formulated
near
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
holy
water
is
designated
as
a
means
of
purification
from
sin
and
of
putting
the
demon
to
flight
and
nowadays
when
the
priest
passes
through
his
congregation
casting
over
them
holy
water
it
is
as
an
exorcism
of
precaution
or
when
as
in
france
each
mourner
at
a
grave
casts
holy
water
over
the
corpse
it
is
undoubtedly
whether
done
consciously
as
such
or
not
to
protect
the
soul
of
the
deceased
from
demons
who
are
held
to
have
as
great
power
over
the
dead
as
over
the
living
other
forms
of
exorcism
too
are
employed
for
example
in
the
it
is
said
of
the
holy
scripture
that
it
the
snares
of
devils
and
vices
are
expelled
from
every
faithful
one
in
the
church
and
from
all
this
direct
testimony
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
many
of
the
chief
practices
of
christians
are
exorcisms
so
that
like
the
religion
of
zoroaster
the
religion
founded
by
jesus
has
come
to
rest
at
least
in
part
upon
the
basic
recognition
of
an
eternal
warfare
between
good
and
bad
spirits
for
the
control
of
man
the
curing
of
diseases
through
christian
exorcism
is
by
no
means
rare
now
and
it
was
common
a
few
centuries
ago
thus
in
the
eighteenth
century
beginning
with
and
till
his
death
gassner
a
roman
priest
of
closterle
diocese
of
coire
switzerland
devoted
his
life
to
curing
people
of
possessions
declaring
that
one
third
of
all
maladies
are
so
caused
and
fixed
his
at
elwangen
and
later
at
ratisbon
his
fame
spread
over
many
countries
of
europe
and
he
is
said
to
have
made
ten
thousand
cures
solely
by
exorcism
and
not
only
are
human
ills
overcome
by
exorcism
but
also
the
maladies
of
beasts
at
carnac
on
september
there
continues
to
be
celebrated
an
annual
fête
in
honour
of
cornely
the
patron
saint
of
the
country
and
the
saint
who
as
his
name
seems
to
suggest
presides
over
domestic
animals
and
if
there
is
a
cow
or
even
a
sheep
suffering
from
some
ailment
which
will
not
yield
to
medicine
its
owner
leads
it
to
the
church
door
beneath
the
saint
statue
and
the
priest
blesses
it
and
as
he
does
so
casts
over
it
the
exorcizing
holy
water
the
church
ritual
designates
two
forms
of
benediction
for
such
animals
one
form
for
those
who
are
ordinarily
diseased
and
another
for
those
suffering
from
some
contagious
malady
in
each
ceremony
there
comes
first
the
sprinkling
of
the
animal
with
holy
water
as
it
stands
before
the
priest
at
the
church
door
and
then
there
follows
in
latin
a
direct
invocation
to
god
to
bless
the
animal
extinguish
in
it
all
diabolical
powers
to
defend
its
life
and
to
restore
it
to
health
in
according
to
evans
an
old
in
north
wales
was
torn
down
and
in
its
walls
was
found
a
tin
box
containing
an
formula
the
box
and
its
enclosed
manuscript
had
been
hidden
there
some
years
previously
to
ward
off
all
evil
spirits
and
witchcraft
for
evidently
the
cattle
had
been
dying
of
some
strange
malady
which
no
doctors
could
cure
because
of
its
unique
nature
and
as
an
illustration
of
what
welsh
exorcisms
must
have
been

to
be

for
on

in

play

prominent

in
the

of

and
covered

with

order
to
produce

fire

in

carnac
country
discovered
the
image
of
a
small
bronze
cow
now
in
the
carnac
museum
and
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
before
christian
times
there
was
in
the
morbihan
a
cult
of
cattle
preserved
even
until
now
no
doubt
in
the
christian
fête
of
cornely
just
as
in
fountain
there
is
preserved
a
pagan
holy
well
it
ought
now
to
be
clear
that
both
and
christian
exorcisms
among
celts
have
shaped
the
in
a
very
fundamental
manner
and
anthropologically
the
whole
subject
of
exorcism
falls
in
line
with
the
psychological
theory
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
the
belief
in
fairies
in
celtic
countries
taboos
we
find
that
taboos
or
prohibitions
of
a
religious
and
social
character
are
as
common
in
the
living
as
exorcisms
the
chief
one
is
the
taboo
against
naming
the
fairies
which
inevitably
results
in
the
use
of
euphemisms
such
as
people
of
peace
folk
or
ladies
a
like
sort
of
taboo
with
its
accompanying
use
of
euphemisms
existed
among
the
ancients
among
the
egyptians
and
babylonians
and
early
celts
as
well
in
a
highly
developed
form
and
it
exists
now
among
the
native
peoples
of
australia
polynesia
central
africa
america
in
indian
systems
of
yoga
among
modern
greeks
and
in
fact
almost
everywhere
where
there
are
vestiges
of
a
primitive
culture
and
almost
always
such
a
taboo
is
bound
up
with
animistic
and
magical
elements
which
seem
to
form
its
background
just
as
it
is
in
our
own
evidence
to
discuss
name
taboo
in
all
its
aspects
would
lead
us
more
deeply
into
magic
and
comparative
than
we
have
yet
gone
and
such
discussion
is
unnecessary
here
we
may
therefore
briefly
state
that
the
root
of
the
matter
would
seem
to
be
that
the
name
and
the
dread
power
named
are
so
closely
associated
in
the
very
concrete
thought
of
the
primitive
culture
that
the
one
virtually
is
the
other
just
as
one
inevitably
calls
up
the
other
for
the
modern
thinker
so
it
is
that
in
the
world
of
objective
fact
for
the
primitive
philosopher
the
one
is
equivalent
to
the
other
the
primitive
man
in
short
has
projected
his
subjective
associations
into
reality
as
regards
euphemisms
the
process
of
development
possibly
is
that
first
you
employ
any
substitute
name
and
that
secondly
you
go
on
to
employ
such
a
substitute
name
as
will
at
the
same
time
be
conciliatory
in
the
latter
case
a
certain
anthropomorphosing
of
the
power
behind
the
taboo
would
seem
to
be
involved
next
in
prominence
comes
the
food
taboo
and
to
this
also
there
are
parallels
all
the
world
over
now
and
in
ancient
times
we
may
take
notice
of
three
very
striking
modern
parallels
a
woman
visited
her
dead
brother
in
panoi
the
polynesian
otherworld
and
cautioned
her
to
eat
nothing
there
and
she
returned
a
red
man
after
an
apparent
death
of
two
days
duration
revived
and
declared
that
he
had
been
to
a
beautiful
land
of
tall
trees
and
where
he
met
the
spirits
of
his
forefathers
and
uncle
while
there
he
felt
hunger
and
seeing
in
a
bark
dish
some
wild
rice
wished
to
eat
of
it
but
his
uncle
would
allow
him
none
in
telling
about
this
psychical
adventure
said
i
eaten
of
the
food
of
spirits
i
never
should
have
returned
to
earth
also
a
new
zealand
woman
visited
the
otherworld
in
a
trance
and
her
dead
father
whom
she
met
there
ordered
her
to
eat
no
food
in
that
land
so
that
she
could
return
to
this
world
to
take
care
of
her
child
all
such
parallels
like
their
equivalents
in
celtic
belief
seem
to
rest
on
this
psychological
and
physiological
conception
in
the
human
food
is
what
keeps
life
going
in
a
human
body
fairy
food
is
what
keeps
life
going
in
a
fairy
body
and
since
what
a
man
eats
makes
him
what
he
is
physically
so
eating
the
food
of
fairyland
or
of
the
land
of
the
dead
will
make
the
eater
partake
of
the
bodily
nature
of
the
beings
it
nourishes
hence
when
a
man
or
woman
has
once
entered
into
such
relation
or
communion
with
the
otherworld
of
the
dead
or
of
fairies
by
eating
their
food
his
or
her
physical
body
by
a
subtle
transformation
adjusts
itself
to
the
new
kind
of
nourishment
and
becomes
spiritual
like
a
spirit
or
fairy
body
so
that
the
eater
can
not
the
world
of
the
living
a
study
of
food
taboos
confirms
this
conclusion
a
third
prominent
taboo
the
iron
taboo
has
been
explained
by
exponents
of
the
pygmy
theory
as
pointing
to
a
prehistoric
race
in
celtic
lands
who
did
not
know
iron
familiarly
and
hence
venerated
it
so
that
in
time
it
came
to
be
religiously
regarded
as
very
efficacious
against
spirits
and
fairies
undoubtedly
there
may
be
much
reason
in
this
explanation
which
gives
some
ethnological
support
to
the
pygmy
theory
apparently
however
it
is
only
a
partial
explanation
of
iron
taboo
in
general
because
in
many
cases
iron
in
ancient
religious
rites
certainly
had
magical
properties
attributed
to
it
which
to
us
are
quite
unexplainable
from
this
ethnological
point
of
view
and
in
melanesia
and
in
africa
where
iron
is
venerated
now
the
same
explanation
through
ethnology
seems
but
at
present
there
seem
to
be
no
available
data
to
explain
adequately
this
iron
taboo
though
we
have
strong
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
philosophy
underlying
it
is
based
on
mystical
conceptions
of
virtues
attributed
reasonably
or
unreasonably
to
various
metals
and
precious
stones
and
that
a
careful
examination
of
alchemical
sciences
would
probably
arrive
at
an
explanation
wholly
psychological
besides
many
other
miscellaneous
taboos
noticeable
in
the
evidence
there
is
a
place
taboo
which
is
prominent
thus
if
an
irishman
cuts
a
thorn
tree
growing
on
a
spot
sacred
to
the
fairies
or
if
he
violates
a
fairy
preserve
of
any
sort
such
as
a
fairy
path
or
by
accident
interferes
with
a
fairy
procession
illness
and
possibly
death
will
come
to
his
cattle
or
even
to
himself
in
the
same
way
in
melanesia
violations
of
sacred
spots
bring
like
penalties
man
planted
in
the
bush
near
olevuga
some
and
almond
trees
and
not
long
after
died
the
place
being
a
spirit
preserve
and
a
man
in
the
island
lost
his
senses
because
as
the
natives
believed
he
had
unwittingly
trodden
on
ground
sacred
to
tagaro
and
ghost
of
the
man
who
lately
sacrificed
there
was
angry
with
him
in
this
case
the
wizards
were
called
in
and
cured
the
man
by
exorcisms
as
irishmen
or
their
cows
are
cured
by
the
exorcisms
of
when
for
some
similar
violation
the
animistic
background
of
place
taboos
in
the
is
in
these
cases
apparent
ancient
in
the
evidence
soon
to
be
examined
from
the
recorded
we
shall
find
taboos
of
various
kinds
often
more
prominent
than
in
the
living
so
essential
are
they
to
the
character
of
much
of
the
literary
and
mythological
matter
with
which
we
shall
have
to
deal
in
the
following
chapters
that
at
this
point
some
suggestions
ought
to
be
made
concerning
their
correct
anthropological
interpretation
almost
every
ancient
irish
taboo
is
connected
with
a
king
or
with
a
great
hero
like
cuchulainn
and
in
ireland
especially
all
such
kings
and
heroes
were
considered
of
divine
origin
and
as
direct
incarnations
or
reincarnations
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
the
true
fairies
originally
inhabitants
of
the
otherworld
see
our
chapter
vii
as
frazer
points
out
to
have
been
the
case
among
with
whom
the
same
theory
of
incarnated
divinities
has
prevailed
royal
taboos
are
to
isolate
the
king
from
all
sources
of
danger
especially
from
all
magic
and
witchcraft
and
they
act
in
many
cases
to
say
as
electrical
insulators
to
preserve
him
or
heroes
who
are
equally
divine
the
early
celts
recognized
an
intimate
relationship
between
man
and
nature
unperceived
by
man
unseen
forces
not
dissimilar
to
what
melanesians
call
looked
on
as
animate
and
intelligent
and
frequently
individual
entities
guided
every
act
of
human
life
it
was
the
special
duty
of
druids
to
act
as
intermediaries
between
the
world
of
men
and
the
world
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
as
old
irish
literature
indicates
clearly
it
was
through
the
exercise
of
powers
of
divination
on
the
part
of
druids
that
these
declared
what
was
taboo
or
what
was
unfavourable
and
also
what
it
was
favourable
for
the
divine
king
or
hero
to
perform
as
long
as
man
kept
himself
in
harmony
with
this
unseen
in
the
background
of
nature
all
was
well
but
as
soon
as
a
taboo
was
broken
disharmony
in
the
relationship
which
was
focused
in
a
king
or
hero
was
set
up
and
when
as
in
the
case
of
cuchulainn
many
taboos
were
violated
death
was
inevitable
and
not
even
the
tuatha
de
danann
could
intercede
breaking
of
a
royal
or
hero
taboo
not
only
affects
the
violator
but
his
subjects
or
followers
as
well
in
some
cases
the
king
seems
to
suffer
vicariously
for
his
people
almost
every
great
gaelic
hero
a
god
or
great
fairy
being
incarnate
is
overshadowed
with
an
impending
fate
which
only
the
strictest
observance
of
taboo
can
avoid
irish
taboo
and
inferentially
all
celtic
taboo
dates
back
to
an
unknown
pagan
antiquity
it
is
imposed
at
or
before
birth
or
again
during
life
usually
at
some
critical
period
and
when
broken
brings
disaster
and
death
to
the
breaker
its
whole
background
appears
to
rest
on
a
supernatural
relationship
between
divine
men
and
the
otherworld
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
it
is
very
certain
that
this
ancient
relationship
survives
in
the
living
as
one
between
ordinary
men
and
the
therefore
almost
all
taboos
surviving
among
celts
ought
to
be
interpreted
psychologically
or
even
psychically
and
not
as
ordinary
social
regulations
plays
a
very
important
rôle
in
the
modern
being
still
practised
as
our
evidence
shows
in
each
one
of
the
celtic
countries
without
any
doubt
it
is
a
survival
from
pagan
times
when
as
we
shall
observe
later
in
chapter
iv
and
elsewhere
propitiatory
offerings
were
regularly
made
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
as
gods
of
the
earth
and
apparently
to
other
orders
of
spiritual
beings
the
anthropological
significance
of
such
is
unmistakable
with
the
same
propitiatory
ends
in
view
as
modern
celts
now
have
in
offering
food
to
fairies
ancient
peoples
the
greeks
and
romans
maintained
a
state
ritual
of
sacrifices
to
the
gods
genii
daemons
and
to
the
dead
and
such
sacrifices
so
essential
a
part
of
most
ancient
religions
were
based
on
the
belief
as
stated
by
porphyry
in
his
concerning
that
all
the
various
orders
of
gods
genii
or
daemons
enjoy
as
nourishment
the
odour
of
burnt
offerings
and
like
the
the
daemons
of
the
air
live
not
on
the
gross
substance
of
food
but
on
its
finer
invisible
essences
conveyed
to
them
most
easily
on
the
socrates
plato
xenophon
and
other
leading
greeks
as
well
as
the
romans
of
a
like
metaphysical
school
unite
in
declaring
the
fundamental
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
of
regular
sacrifices
to
the
gods
and
to
the
daemons
who
control
all
natural
phenomena
since
they
caused
if
not
neglected
abundant
harvests
and
national
prosperity
for
unto
the
gods
is
due
by
right
a
part
of
all
things
which
they
give
to
man
for
his
happiness
the
relation
which
the
worship
of
ancestors
held
to
that
of
the
gods
above
who
are
the
olympian
gods
the
great
gods
and
to
the
gods
below
who
are
the
gods
of
the
dead
and
also
to
the
daemons
and
heroes
or
divine
ancestors
is
thus
set
forth
by
plato
in
his
the
first
place
we
affirm
that
next
after
the
olympian
gods
and
the
gods
of
the
state
honour
should
be
given
to
the
gods
below
next
to
these
gods
a
wise
man
will
do
service
to
the
daemons
or
spirits
and
then
to
the
heroes
and
after
them
will
follow
the
sacred
places
of
private
and
ancestral
gods
having
their
ritual
according
to
law
next
comes
the
honour
of
living
parents
it
is
evident
from
this
direct
testimony
that
the
same
sort
of
philosophy
underlies
among
the
celts
and
other
peoples
as
we
discovered
underlying
in
our
study
of
the
changeling
belief
and
that
the
tuatha
de
danann
in
their
true
mythological
nature
and
fairies
their
modern
counterpart
correspond
in
all
essentials
to
greek
and
roman
gods
genii
and
daemons
and
are
often
confused
with
the
dead
the
celtic
legend
of
the
dead
the
animistic
character
of
the
celtic
legend
of
the
dead
is
apparent
and
the
striking
likenesses
constantly
appearing
in
our
evidence
between
the
ordinary
apparitional
fairies
and
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
show
that
there
is
often
no
essential
and
sometimes
no
distinguishable
difference
between
these
two
orders
of
beings
nor
between
the
world
of
the
dead
and
fairyland
we
reserve
for
our
chapter
on
and
the
scientific
consideration
of
the
psychology
of
this
relationship
and
of
the
probability
that
fairies
as
souls
of
the
dead
and
as
ghosts
of
the
dead
actually
exist
and
influence
the
living
general
conclusion
the
chief
anthropological
problems
connected
with
the
modern
as
our
evidence
presents
it
have
now
been
examined
at
sufficient
length
we
trust
to
explain
their
essential
significance
and
problems
to
some
extent
parallel
connected
with
the
ancient
have
likewise
been
examined
there
remain
however
very
many
minor
anthropological
problems
not
yet
touched
upon
but
several
of
the
most
important
of
these
various
cults
of
gods
spirits
fairies
and
the
dead
and
thereto
related

or
as

will
receive
consideration
in
following
chapters
and
so
will
certain
very
definite
psychological
problems
connected
with
dreams
and
states
with
supernormal
lapse
of
time
and
with
seership
we
may
now
sum
up
the
results
so
far
attained
whether
we
examine
the
as
a
whole
or
whether
we
examine
specialized
parts
of
it
like
those
relating
to
the
smallness
of
fairies
to
changelings
to
witchcraft
and
magic
to
exorcisms
to
taboos
and
to
in
all
cases
comparative
shows
that
the
beliefs
composing
it
find
their
parallels
the
world
over
and
that
beings
are
objects
of
belief
now
not
only
in
celtic
countries
but
in
central
australia
throughout
polynesia
in
africa
among
american
red
men
in
asia
generally
in
southern
western
and
northern
europe
and
in
fact
wherever
civilized
and
primitive
men
hold
religious
beliefs
from
a
rationalist
point
of
view
anthropologists
would
be
inclined
to
regard
the
bulk
of
this
widespread
belief
in
spiritual
beings
as
being
purely
mythical
but
for
us
to
do
so
and
stop
there
would
lead
to
no
satisfactory
solution
the
origin
of
myth
itself
needs
to
be
explained
and
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
our
study
throughout
the
remainder
of
this
book
is
to
make
an
attempt
at
such
an
explanation
especially
of
celtic
myth
again
if
we
examine
all
beings
from
a
certain
superficial
point
of
view
or
even
from
the
mythological
point
of
view
it
is
easy
to
discern
that
they
are
universally
credited
with
precisely
the
same
characters
attributes
actions
or
powers
as
the
particular
peoples
possess
who
have
faith
in
them
and
then
the
further
fact
emerges
that
this
anthropomorphosing
is
due
directly
to
the
more
immediate
social
environment
we
see
merely
an
anthropomorphically
coloured
picture
of
the
whole
of
an
social
evolution
of
the
tribe
race
or
nation
who
have
fostered
the
particular
aspect
of
this
one
but
if
we
look
still
deeper
we
discover
as
background
to
the
myths
and
the
social
psychology
a
profound
animism
this
animism
appears
in
its
own
environment
in
the
shading
away
of
the
different
beings
into
spirits
and
ghosts
of
the
departed
going
deeper
yet
we
find
that
such
animistic
beliefs
as
concern
themselves
exclusively
with
the
realm
of
the
dead
are
in
many
cases
apparently
so
well
founded
on
definite
provable
psychical
experiences
on
the
part
of
living
men
and
women
that
the
aid
of
science
itself
must
be
called
in
to
explain
them
and
this
will
be
done
in
our
chapter
entitled
and
so
far
it
ought
to
be
clear
that
already
our
evidence
points
to
a
very
respectable
residue
in
the
experiences
of
percipients
which
can
not
be
explained
away
as
can
the
larger
mass
of
the
evidence
as
due
to
ethnological
anthropomorphic
naturalistic
or
sociological
influences
on
the
celtic
mind
and
for
the
present
this
must
be
designated
as
the
or
unknown
quantity
in
the
in
chapter
xi
this
quantity
augmented
by
whatever
else
is
to
be
elicited
from
further
evidence
will
be
specifically
discussed
these
points
of
view
derived
from
our
anthropological
examination
of
the
chief
parts
of
the
evidence
presented
by
the
living
will
be
kept
constantly
before
us
as
we
proceed
further
and
what
has
been
demonstrated
anthropologically
in
this
chapter
will
serve
to
interpret
what
is
to
follow
until
chapter
xi
is
reached
with
this
tentative
position
we
pass
to
section
ii
of
this
study
and
shall
there
begin
to
examine
as
we
have
just
done
with
their
modern
the
ancient
of
the
celts
section
ii
the
recorded
chapter
iv
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
dé
or
the
pronounced
firm
was
the
hold
which
the
ethnic
gods
of
ireland
had
taken
upon
the
imagination
and
spiritual
sensibilities
of
our
ancestors
that
even
the
monks
and
christianized
bards
never
thought
of
denying
them
they
doubtless
forbade
the
people
to
worship
them
but
to
root
out
the
belief
in
their
existence
was
so
impossible
that
they
could
not
even
dispossess
their
own
minds
of
the
conviction
that
the
gods
were
real
supernatural
beings
standish
the
goddess
dana
and
the
modern
cult
of
brigit
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
conquered
by
the
sons
of
mil
but
irish
seers
still
see
the
old
irish
mss
faithfully
represent
the
tuatha
de
danann
the
as
a
spirit
race
palaces
the
of
mortals
hill
visions
of
women
minstrels
and
musicians
social
organization
and
warfare
among
the
the

the

of
clontarf
conclusion
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
or
according
to
de
jubainville
the
people
of
the
god
whose
mother
was
called
dana
are
the
tuatha
de
danann
of
the
ancient
mythology
of
ireland
the
goddess
dana
called
in
the
genitive
danand
in
middle
irish
times
was
named
brigit
and
this
goddess
brigit
of
the
pagan
celts
has
been
supplanted
by
the
christian
brigit
and
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
pagan
cult
once
bestowed
on
the
spirits
in
wells
and
fountains
has
been
transferred
to
christian
saints
to
whom
the
wells
and
fountains
have
been
so
to
brigit
as
a
national
saint
has
been
transferred
the
pagan
cult
rendered
to
her
predecessor
thus
even
yet
as
in
the
case
of
the
minor
divinities
of
their
sacred
fountains
the
irish
people
through
their
veneration
for
the
good
brigit
render
homage
to
the
divine
mother
of
the
people
who
bear
her
name
dana
who
are
the
invisible
of
modern
ireland
for
when
the
sons
of
mil
the
ancestors
of
the
irish
people
came
to
ireland
they
found
the
tuatha
de
danann
in
full
possession
of
the
country
the
tuatha
de
danann
then
retired
before
the
invaders
without
however
giving
up
their
sacred
island
assuming
invisibility
with
the
power
of
at
any
time
reappearing
in
a
form
before
the
children
of
the
sons
of
mil
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
became
and
are
the
the
of
irish
mythology
and
romance
therefore
it
is
that
ireland
contains
two
races
a
race
visible
which
we
call
celts
and
a
race
invisible
which
we
call
fairies
between
these
two
races
there
is
constant
intercourse
even
now
for
irish
seers
say
that
they
can
behold
the
majestic
beautiful
and
according
to
them
the
are
a
race
quite
distinct
from
our
own
just
as
living
and
possibly
more
powerful
these
who
are
the
of
the
ben
bulbin
country
and
have
kindred
elsewhere
in
ireland
scotland
and
probably
in
most
other
countries
as
well
such
as
the
invisible
races
of
the
yosemite
valley
have
been
described
more
or
less
accurately
by
our
peasant
from
county
sligo
and
from
north
and
east
ireland
but
there
are
other
and
probably
more
reliable
seers
in
ireland
men
of
greater
education
and
greater
psychical
experience
who
know
and
describe
the
races
as
they
really
are
and
who
even
sketch
their
likenesses
and
to
such
seer
celts
as
these
death
is
a
passport
to
the
world
of
the
a
world
where
there
is
eternal
youth
and
joy
as
we
shall
learn
when
we
study
it
as
the
celtic
otherworld
the
recorded
mythology
and
literature
of
ancient
ireland
have
very
faithfully
for
the
most
part
preserved
to
us
clear
pictures
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
so
that
disregarding
some
christian
influence
in
the
texts
of
certain
manuscripts
much
rationalization
and
a
good
deal
of
poetical
colouring
and
romantic
imagination
in
the
pictures
we
can
easily
describe
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
as
they
appeared
in
pagan
days
when
they
were
more
frequently
seen
by
mortals
than
now
perhaps
the
irish
folk
of
the
olden
times
were
even
more
clairvoyant
and
than
the
irish
folk
of
so
by
drawing
upon
these
written
records
let
us
try
to
understand
what
sort
of
beings
the
were
and
are
nature
of
the
in
the
of
the
poem
of
records
that
the
tuatha
de
danann
the
conquerors
of
the
were
hosts
of
and
is
an
old
irish
word
meaning
fairies
sprites
or
ghosts
the
word
fairies
is
appropriate
if
restricted
to
mean
fairies
like
the
modern
but
the
word
is
inappropriate
because
our
evidence
shows
that
the
only
relation
the
or
real
fairies
hold
to
ghosts
is
a
superficial
one
the
and
ghosts
being
alike
only
in
respect
to
invisibility
in
the
two
chief
irish
the
of
the
dun
and
the
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
are
described
as
and
and
sir
john
rhŷs
considers
this
an
ancient
formula
comparable
with
the
sanskrit
and
but
not
with
and
husbandmen
as
the
author
of
learnedly
guessed
it
is
also
said
in
the
of
the
dun
that
wise
men
do
not
know
the
origin
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
but
that
seems
likely
to
them
that
they
came
from
heaven
on
account
of
their
intelligence
and
for
the
excellence
of
their
knowledge
the
hold
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
on
the
irish
mind
and
spirit
was
so
strong
that
even
christian
transcribers
of
texts
could
not
deny
their
existence
as
a
race
of
intelligent
beings
inhabiting
ireland
even
though
they
frequently
misrepresented
them
by
placing
them
on
the
level
of
evil
demons
as
the
ending
of
the
story
of
the
of
illustrates
that
this
was
a
vision
to
cuchulainn
of
being
stricken
by
the
people
of
the
for
the
demoniac
power
was
great
before
the
faith
and
such
was
its
greatness
that
the
demons
used
to
fight
bodily
against
mortals
and
they
used
to
show
them
delights
and
secrets
of
how
they
would
be
in
immortality
it
was
thus
they
used
to
be
believed
in
so
it
is
to
such
phantoms
the
ignorant
apply
the
names
of
and
a
passage
in
the
ii
not
only
tends
to
confirm
this
last
statement
but
it
also
shows
that
the
irish
people
made
a
clear
distinction
between
the
and
our
own
in
colloquy
with
the
as
patrick
and
caeilte
are
talking
with
one
another
lone
woman
robed
in
mantle
of
green
a
smock
of
soft
silk
being
next
her
skin
and
on
her
forehead
a
glittering
plate
of
yellow
gold
came
to
them
and
when
patrick
asked
from
whence
she
came
she
replied
of
or
the
cave
of
cruachan
caeilte
then
asked
my
soul
who
art
thou
am
or
daughter
of
the
daghda
son
bodhb
derg
caeilte
proceeded
what
started
thee
hither
require
of
thee
my
because
once
upon
a
time
thou
promisedst
me
such
and
as
they
parleyed
patrick
broke
in
with
is
a
wonder
to
us
how
we
see
you
two
the
girl
young
and
invested
with
all
comeliness
but
thou
caeilte
a
withered
ancient
bent
in
the
back
and
dingily
grown
grey
is
no
wonder
at
all
said
caeilte
no
people
of
one
generation
or
of
one
time
are
we
is
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
who
are
unfading
and
whose
duration
is
perennial
i
am
of
the
sons
of
milesius
that
are
perishable
and
fade
the
exact
distinction
is
between
caeilte
a
withered
old
ancient
in
most
ways
to
be
regarded
as
a
ghost
called
up
that
patrick
may
question
him
about
the
past
history
of
ireland
and
a
who
is
one
of
the
or
tuatha
de
danann
in
two
of
the
more
ancient
irish
texts
the
or
of
nera
a
preliminary
tale
in
the
introduction
to
the
bó
or
of
the
cattle
of
cuailnge
and
a
passage
from
the
bruidne
dâ
or
of
da
hostel
there
seems
no
reasonable
doubt
whatever
about
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
being
a
race
like
what
we
call
spirits
the
first
text
describes
how
ailill
and
medb
in
their
palace
of
cruachan
celebrated
the
feast
of
november
eve
a
feast
of
the
dead
even
in
times
two
culprits
had
been
executed
on
the
day
before
and
their
bodies
according
to
the
ancient
irish
custom
were
left
hanging
from
a
tree
until
the
night
of
should
have
passed
for
on
that
night
it
was
dangerous
to
touch
the
bodies
of
the
dead
while
demons
and
the
people
of
the
were
at
large
throughout
all
ireland
and
mortals
found
near
dead
bodies
at
such
a
time
were
in
great
danger
of
being
by
these
spirit
hosts
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
so
on
this
very
night
when
thick
darkness
had
settled
down
ailill
desired
to
test
the
courage
of
his
warriors
and
offered
his
own
sword
to
any
young
man
who
would
go
out
and
tie
a
coil
of
twisted
twigs
around
the
leg
of
one
of
the
bodies
suspended
from
the
tree
after
many
had
made
the
attempt
and
failed
because
unable
to
brave
the
legions
of
demons
and
fairies
nera
alone
succeeded
but
his
success
cost
him
dear
for
he
finally
fell
under
the
power
both
of
the
dead
man
round
whose
legs
he
had
tied
the
coil
and
of
an
elfin
host
with
the
dead
man
body
on
his
back
nera
was
obliged
to
go
to
a
strange
house
that
the
thirst
of
the
dead
man
might
be
assuaged
therein
and
the
dead
man
in
drinking
scattered
last
sip
from
his
lips
at
the
faces
of
the
people
that
were
in
the
house
so
that
they
all
died
nera
carried
back
the
body
and
on
returning
to
cruachan
he
saw
the
fairy
hosts
going
into
the
cave
the
of
erinn
are
always
opened
about
halloween
nera
followed
after
them
until
he
came
to
their
king
in
a
palace
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
seemingly
in
the
cavern
or
elsewhere
underground
where
he
remained
and
was
married
to
one
of
the
fairy
women
she
it
was
who
revealed
to
nera
the
secret
in
a
mysterious
well
of
the
king
golden
crown
and
then
betrayed
her
whole
people
by
reporting
to
nera
the
plan
they
had
for
attacking
ailill
court
on
the
halloween
to
come
moreover
nera
was
permitted
by
his
fairy
wife
to
depart
from
the
and
he
in
taking
leave
of
her
asked
will
it
be
believed
of
me
that
i
have
gone
into
the
fruits
of
summer
with
thee
said
the
woman
he
took
wild
garlic
with
him
and
primrose
and
golden
fern
and
on
the
following
november
eve
when
the
of
cruachan
was
again
open
men
of
connaught
and
the
black
hosts
of
exile
under
ailill
and
medb
plundered
it
taking
away
from
it
the
crown
of
briun
out
of
the
well
but
was
left
with
his
people
in
the
and
has
not
come
out
until
now
nor
will
he
come
till
doom
all
of
this
matter
is
definitely
enough
in
line
with
the
living
there
is
the
same
belief
expressed
as
now
about
november
eve
being
the
time
of
all
times
when
ghosts
demons
spirits
and
fairies
are
free
and
when
fairies
mortals
and
marry
them
to
fairy
women
also
the
beliefs
that
fairies
are
living
in
secret
places
in
hills
in
caverns
or
under
ground
palaces
full
of
treasure
and
open
only
on
november
eve
in
so
far
as
the
real
fairies
the
are
concerned
they
appear
as
the
rulers
of
the
feast
of
the
dead
or
as
the
controllers
of
all
spirits
who
are
then
at
large
and
allowing
for
some
poetical
imagination
and
much
social
psychology
and
anthropomorphism
elements
as
common
in
this
as
in
most
literary
descriptions
concerning
the
tuatha
de
danann
they
are
faithfully
enough
presented
the
second
text
describes
how
king
conaire
in
riding
along
a
road
toward
tara
saw
in
front
of
him
three
strange
horsemen
three
men
of
the
red
frocks
had
they
and
three
red
mantles
three
red
steeds
they
bestrode
and
three
red
heads
of
hair
were
on
them
red
were
they
all
both
body
and
hair
and
raiment
both
steeds
and
men
is
it
that
fares
before
us
asked
conaire
was
a
taboo
of
mine
for
those
three
to
go
before
me
the
three
reds
to
the
house
of
red
who
will
follow
them
and
tell
them
to
come
towards
me
in
my
track
will
follow
them
says
lé
fri
flaith
conaire
son
goes
after
them
lashing
his
horse
and
overtook
them
not
there
was
the
length
of
a
spearcast
between
them
but
they
did
not
gain
upon
him
and
he
did
not
gain
upon
them
all
attempts
to
come
up
with
the
red
horsemen
failed
but
at
last
before
they
disappeared
one
of
the
three
said
to
the
king
son
riding
so
furiously
behind
them
my
son
great
the
news
weary
are
the
steeds
we
ride
we
ride
the
steeds
of
donn
tetscorach
from
the
elfmounds
though
we
are
alive
we
are
dead
great
are
the
signs
destruction
of
life
sating
of
ravens
feeding
of
crows
strife
of
slaughter
wetting
of
shields
with
broken
bosses
in
hours
after
sundown
lo
my
son
then
they
disappear
when
conaire
and
his
followers
heard
the
message
fear
fell
upon
them
and
the
king
said
my
taboos
have
seized
me
since
those
three
reds
are
the
banished
folks
in
this
passage
we
behold
three
horsemen
of
the
banished
from
their
elfmound
because
guilty
of
falsehood
visible
for
a
time
they
precede
the
king
and
so
violate
one
of
his
taboos
and
then
delivering
their
fearful
prophecy
they
vanish
these
three
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
majestic
and
powerful
and
weird
in
their
mystic
red
are
like
the
warriors
of
the
seen
by
contemporary
seers
in
west
ireland
though
dead
that
is
in
an
invisible
world
like
the
dead
yet
they
are
living
it
seems
that
in
all
three
of
the
textual
examples
already
cited
the
scribe
has
emphasized
a
different
element
in
the
unique
nature
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
in
the
it
is
their
eternal
youth
and
beauty
in
the
it
is
their
supremacy
over
ghosts
and
demons
on
and
their
power
to
steal
mortals
away
at
such
a
time
and
in
this
last
their
respect
for
honesty
and
in
each
case
their
portrayal
corresponds
to
that
of
the
and
by
modern
irishmen
so
that
the
old
and
the
new
combine
to
prove
the
people
of
the
god
whose
mother
was
dana
to
have
been
and
to
be
a
race
of
beings
who
are
like
mortals
but
not
mortals
who
to
the
objective
world
are
as
though
dead
yet
to
the
subjective
world
are
fully
living
and
conscious
says
term
pron
as
far
as
we
know
it
is
always
applied
in
old
writings
to
the
palaces
courts
halls
or
residences
of
those
beings
which
in
ancient
gaedhelic
mythology
held
the
place
which
ghosts
phantoms
and
fairies
hold
in
the
superstitions
of
the
present
day
in
modern
irish
tradition
people
of
the
or
simply
the
refer
to
the
beings
themselves
rather
than
to
their
places
of
habitation
partly
perhaps
on
account
of
this
popular
opinion
that
the
are
a
subterranean
race
they
are
sometimes
described
as
gods
of
the
earth
or
as
in
the
of
and
since
it
was
believed
that
they
like
the
modern
fairies
control
the
ripening
of
crops
and
the
of
cows
the
ancient
irish
rendered
to
them
regular
worship
and
sacrifice
just
as
the
irish
of
do
by
setting
out
food
at
night
for
the
to
eat
thus
after
their
conquest
these
or
tuatha
de
danann
in
retaliation
and
perhaps
to
show
their
power
as
agricultural
gods
destroyed
the
wheat
and
milk
of
their
conquerors
the
sons
of
mil
as
fairies
can
do
and
the
sons
of
mil
were
constrained
to
make
a
treaty
with
their
supreme
king
dagda
who
in
is
himself
called
an
then
when
the
treaty
was
made
the
sons
of
mil
were
once
more
able
to
gather
wheat
in
their
fields
and
to
drink
the
milk
of
their
cows
and
we
can
suppose
that
ever
since
that
time
their
descendants
who
are
the
people
of
ireland
remembering
that
treaty
have
continued
to
reverence
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
by
pouring
libations
of
milk
to
them
and
by
making
them
offerings
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
palaces
of
the
the
marvellous
palaces
to
which
the
tuatha
de
danann
retired
when
conquered
by
the
race
of
mil
were
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
in
hills
or
under
ridges
more
or
less
elevated
at
the
time
of
their
conquest
dagda
their
high
king
made
a
distribution
of
all
such
palaces
in
his
kingdom
he
gave
one
to
lug
son
of
ethne
another
to
ogme
and
for
himself
retained
two
one
called
na
or
castle
of
the
boyne
because
it
was
situated
on
or
near
the
river
boyne
near
tara
and
the
other
called
or
maic
ind
which
means
enchanted
palace
or
castle
of
the
son
of
the
young
and
this
mac
ind
oc
was
dagda
own
son
by
the
queen
boann
according
to
some
accounts
so
that
as
the
name
son
of
the
young
signifies
dagda
and
boann
both
immortals
both
tuatha
de
danann
were
necessarily
always
young
never
knowing
the
touch
of
disease
or
decay
or
old
age
not
until
christianity
gained
its
psychic
triumph
at
tara
through
the
magic
of
patrick
prevailing
against
the
magic
of
the
druids
who
seem
to
have
stood
at
that
time
as
mediators
between
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
and
the
pagan
irish
did
the
tuatha
de
danann
lose
their
immortal
youthfulness
in
the
eyes
of
mortals
and
become
subject
to
death
in
the
most
ancient
manuscripts
of
ireland
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
divine
race
intact
and
without
restraint
but
in
the
na
or
of
the
cemeteries
from
the
na
and
in
the
or
of
the
conquests
from
the
of
it
was
completely
changed
by
the
christian
scribes
when
dagda
thus
distributed
the
underground
palaces
mac
ind
oc
or
as
he
was
otherwise
called
oengus
was
absent
and
hence
forgotten
so
when
he
returned
naturally
he
complained
to
his
father
and
the
na
the
king
own
residence
was
ceded
to
him
for
a
night
and
a
day
but
oengus
maintained
that
it
was
for
ever
this
palace
was
a
most
marvellous
one
it
contained
three
trees
which
always
bore
fruit
a
vessel
full
of
excellent
drink
and
two
pigs
one
alive
and
the
other
nicely
cooked
ready
to
eat
at
any
time
and
in
this
palace
no
one
ever
died
in
the
caeilte
tells
of
a
mountain
containing
a
fairy
palace
which
no
man
save
finn
and
six
companions
caeilte
being
one
of
these
ever
entered
the
fenians
while
hunting
were
led
thither
by
a
fairy
woman
who
had
changed
her
shape
to
that
of
a
fawn
in
order
to
allure
them
and
the
night
being
wild
and
snowy
they
were
glad
to
take
shelter
therein
beautiful
damsels
and
their
lovers
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
palace
in
it
there
was
music
and
abundance
of
food
and
drink
and
on
its
floor
stood
a
chair
of
crystal
in
another
fairy
palace
the
enchanted
cave
of
keshcorran
conaran
son
of
imidel
a
chief
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
had
sway
so
soon
as
he
perceived
that
the
hounds
cry
now
sounded
deviously
he
bade
his
three
daughters
that
were
full
of
sorcery
to
go
and
take
vengeance
on
finn
for
his
hunting
just
as
nowadays
the
people
take
vengeance
on
one
of
our
race
if
a
fairy
domain
is
violated
frequently
the
fairy
palace
is
under
a
lake
as
in
the
christianized
story
of
the
of
once
when
cleric
chanted
his
psalms
he
saw
come
towards
him
a
tall
man
that
emerged
out
of
the
loch
from
the
bottom
of
the
water
that
is
to
say
this
tall
man
informed
the
cleric
that
he
came
from
an
monastery
and
explained
there
should
be
subaqueous
inhabiting
by
men
is
with
god
no
harder
than
that
they
should
dwell
in
any
other
place
in
all
these
ancient
literary
accounts
of
the
we
easily
recognize
the
same
sort
of
palaces
as
those
described
by
gaelic
peasants
as
the
habitations
of
the
or
people
or
of
peace
such
habitations
are
in
mountain
caverns
like
those
of
ben
bulbin
or
knock
ma
or
in
fairy
hills
or
knolls
like
the
at
aberfoyle
on
which
robert
kirk
is
believed
to
have
been
or
beneath
lakes
this
brings
us
directly
to
the
way
in
which
the
or
tuatha
de
danann
of
the
olden
times
young
men
and
maidens
how
the
mortals
perhaps
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
famous
literary
accounts
of
such
a
is
that
concerning
aedh
son
of
eochaid
lethderg
son
of
the
king
of
leinster
who
is
represented
as
contemporary
with
patrick
while
aedh
was
enjoying
a
game
of
hurley
with
his
boy
companions
near
the
of
liamhain
softsmock
two
of
the
who
loved
the
young
prince
very
suddenly
appeared
and
as
suddenly
took
him
away
with
them
into
a
fairy
palace
and
kept
him
there
three
years
it
happened
however
that
he
escaped
at
the
end
of
that
time
and
knowing
the
magical
powers
of
patrick
went
to
where
the
holy
man
was
and
thus
explained
himself
the
youths
my
opponents
i
my
side
took
seven
goals
but
at
the
last
one
that
i
took
here
come
up
to
me
two
women
clad
in
green
mantles
two
daughters
of
derg
mac
an
and
their
names
and
either
of
them
took
me
by
a
hand
and
they
led
me
off
to
a
garish
whereby
for
now
three
years
my
people
mourn
after
me
the
caring
for
me
ever
since
and
until
last
night
i
got
a
chance
opening
to
escape
from
the
when
to
the
number
of
fifty
lads
we
emerged
out
of
the
and
forth
upon
the
green
then
it
was
that
i
considered
the
magnitude
of
that
strait
in
which
they
of
the
had
had
me
and
away
from
the
i
came
running
to
seek
thee
holy
patrick
said
the
saint
be
to
thee
a
safeguard
so
that
neither
their
power
nor
their
dominion
shall
any
more
prevail
against
thee
and
so
when
patrick
had
thus
made
aedh
proof
against
the
power
of
the
he
kept
him
with
him
under
the
disguise
of
a
travelling
minstrel
until
arriving
in
leinster
he
restored
him
to
his
father
the
king
and
to
his
inheritance
aedh
enters
the
palace
in
his
minstrel
disguise
and
in
the
presence
of
the
royal
assembly
patrick
commands
him
now
once
for
all
thy
dark
capacious
hood
and
well
mayest
thou
wear
thy
spear
when
the
lad
removed
his
hood
and
none
there
but
recognized
him
great
was
the
surprise
he
seemed
like
one
come
back
from
the
dead
for
long
had
his
heirless
father
and
people
mourned
for
him
our
word
exclaimed
the
assembly
in
their
joyous
excitement
is
a
good
cleric
gift
and
the
king
said
patrick
seeing
that
till
this
day
thou
hast
nourished
him
and
nurtured
let
not
the
tuatha
de
danann
power
any
more
prevail
against
the
lad
and
patrick
answered
death
which
the
king
of
heaven
and
earth
hath
ordained
is
the
one
that
he
will
have
this
ancient
legend
shows
clearly
that
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
in
the
time
when
the
scribe
wrote
the
were
thought
of
in
the
same
way
as
now
as
able
to
beautiful
mortals
whom
they
loved
and
able
to
confer
upon
them
fairy
immortality
which
prevented
death
which
the
king
of
heaven
and
earth
hath
ordained
mortals
did
they
will
it
could
live
in
the
world
of
the
for
ever
and
we
shall
see
this
more
fully
in
our
study
of
the
otherworld
but
here
it
will
be
interesting
to
learn
that
unlike
aedh
whom
some
perhaps
would
call
a
foolish
youth
laeghaire
also
a
prince
for
he
was
the
son
of
the
king
of
connaught
entered
a
of
the
taking
fifty
other
warriors
with
him
and
he
and
his
followers
found
life
in
fairyland
so
pleasant
that
they
all
decided
to
enjoy
it
eternally
accordingly
when
they
had
been
there
a
year
they
planned
to
return
to
connaught
in
order
to
bid
the
king
and
his
people
a
final
farewell
they
announced
their
plan
and
fiachna
of
the
told
them
how
to
accomplish
it
safely
ye
would
come
back
take
with
you
horses
but
by
no
means
dismount
from
off
them
it
was
done
they
went
their
way
and
came
upon
a
general
assembly
in
which
connaught
as
at
the
year
expired
mourned
for
the
aforesaid
whom
now
all
at
once
they
perceived
above
them
on
higher
ground
connaught
sprang
to
meet
them
but
laeghaire
cried
approach
us
not
to
touch
us
is
to
bid
you
farewell
that
we
are
here
leave
me
not
crimthann
his
father
said
connaught
royal
power
be
thine
their
silver
and
their
gold
their
horses
with
their
bridles
and
their
noble
women
be
at
thy
discretion
only
leave
me
not
but
laeghaire
turned
from
them
and
so
entered
again
into
the
where
with
fiachna
he
exercises
joint
kingly
rule
nor
is
he
as
yet
come
out
of
it
hill
visions
of
women
there
are
many
recorded
traditions
which
represent
certain
hills
as
mystical
places
whereon
men
are
favoured
with
visions
of
fairy
women
thus
one
day
king
muirchertach
came
forth
to
hunt
on
the
border
of
the
brugh
near
stackallan
bridge
county
meath
and
his
companions
left
him
alone
on
his
had
not
been
there
long
when
he
saw
a
solitary
damsel
beautifully
formed
with
a
green
mantle
about
her
sitting
near
him
on
the
turfen
mound
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
of
womankind
he
had
never
beheld
her
equal
in
beauty
and
refinement
in
the
mabinogion
of
prince
of
which
seems
to
be
only
a
brythonic
treatment
of
an
original
gaelic
tale
pwyll
seating
himself
on
a
mound
where
any
mortal
sitting
might
see
a
prodigy
saw
a
fairy
woman
ride
past
on
a
white
horse
and
she
clad
in
a
garment
of
shining
gold
though
he
tried
to
have
his
servitor
on
the
swiftest
horse
capture
her
was
some
magic
about
the
lady
that
kept
her
always
the
same
distance
ahead
though
she
appeared
to
be
riding
slowly
when
on
the
second
day
pwyll
returned
to
the
mound
the
fairy
woman
came
riding
by
as
before
and
the
servitor
again
gave
unsuccessful
chase
pwyll
saw
her
in
the
same
manner
on
the
third
day
he
thereupon
gave
chase
himself
and
when
he
exclaimed
to
her
the
sake
of
the
man
whom
you
love
wait
for
me
she
stopped
and
by
mutual
arrangement
the
two
agreed
to
meet
and
to
marry
at
the
end
of
a
year
the
minstrels
or
musicians
of
the
not
only
did
the
of
more
ancient
times
enjoy
wonderful
palaces
full
of
beauty
and
riches
and
a
life
of
eternal
youth
but
they
also
had
even
as
now
minstrelsy
and
rare
music
music
to
which
that
of
our
own
world
could
not
be
compared
at
all
for
even
patrick
himself
said
that
it
would
equal
the
very
music
of
heaven
if
it
were
not
for
twang
of
the
fairy
spell
that
infests
it
and
this
is
how
it
was
that
patrick
heard
the
fairy
music
as
he
was
travelling
through
ireland
he
once
sat
down
on
a
grassy
knoll
as
he
often
did
in
the
good
old
irish
way
with
ulidia
king
and
nobles
and
caeilte
also
were
they
long
there
before
they
saw
draw
near
them
a
or
that
wore
a
fair
green
mantle
having
in
it
a
fibula
of
silver
a
shirt
of
yellow
silk
next
his
skin
over
and
outside
that
again
a
tunic
of
soft
satin
and
with
a
a
sort
of
harp
of
the
best
slung
on
his
back
whence
comest
thou
asked
the
king
out
of
the
of
the
daghda
son
bodhb
derg
out
of
southern
part
what
moved
thee
out
of
the
south
and
who
art
thou
thyself
i
am
cascorach
son
of
cainchinn
that
is
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
am
myself
the
makings
of
an
an
aspirant
to
the
grade
what
started
me
was
the
design
to
acquire
knowledge
and
information
and
lore
for
recital
and
the
mighty
deeds
of
valour
from
caeilte
son
of
ronan
then
he
took
his
and
made
for
them
music
and
minstrelsy
so
that
he
sent
them
slumbering
off
to
sleep
and
cascorach
music
was
pleasing
to
patrick
who
said
of
it
indeed
it
were
but
for
a
twang
of
the
fairy
spell
that
infests
it
barring
which
nothing
could
more
nearly
than
it
resemble
heaven
harmony
and
that
very
night
which
followed
the
day
on
which
the
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
came
to
them
was
the
eve
of
there
was
also
another
of
these
fairy
called
wondrous
elfin
man
mac
midhna
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
that
out
of
finnachaidh
to
the
northward
used
to
come
to
tara
the
manner
of
his
coming
being
with
a
musical
in
his
hand
the
which
whenever
any
heard
he
would
at
once
sleep
then
all
being
lulled
thus
out
of
his
mouth
aillén
would
emit
a
blast
of
fire
it
was
on
the
solemn
november
day
he
came
in
every
year
played
his
and
to
the
fairy
music
that
he
made
all
hands
would
fall
asleep
with
his
breath
he
used
to
blow
up
the
flame
and
so
during
a
years
spell
yearly
burnt
up
tara
with
all
her
gear
and
it
is
said
that
finn
finally
overcoming
the
magic
of
aillén
slew
him
perhaps
in
the
first
musician
cascorach
though
he
is
described
as
the
son
of
a
tuatha
de
danann
minstrel
we
behold
a
mortal
like
one
of
the
many
irish
pipers
and
musicians
who
used
to
go
or
even
go
yet
to
the
to
be
educated
in
the
musical
profession
and
then
come
back
as
the
most
marvellous
players
that
ever
were
in
ireland
though
if
cascorach
were
once
a
mortal
it
seems
that
he
has
been
quite
transformed
in
bodily
nature
so
as
to
be
really
one
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
himself
but
aillén
mac
midhna
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
mighty
who
could
as
we
heard
from
county
sligo
destroy
half
the
human
race
if
they
wished
aillén
visits
tara
the
old
psychic
centre
both
for
ireland
and
its
druids
he
comes
as
it
were
against
the
conquerors
of
his
race
who
in
their
neglectfulness
no
longer
render
due
worship
and
sacrifice
on
the
feast
of
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
the
gods
of
the
dead
at
that
time
supreme
and
then
it
is
that
he
works
his
magic
against
the
royal
palaces
of
the
kings
and
druids
on
the
ancient
hill
and
to
overcome
the
magic
of
aillén
and
slay
him
that
is
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
repeat
his
annual
visits
to
tara
it
required
the
might
of
the
great
hero
finn
who
himself
was
related
to
the
same
race
for
by
a
woman
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
he
had
his
famous
son
ossian
oisin
in
who
is
manannan
mac
lir
the
greatest
magician
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
disguised
as
a
being
who
can
disappear
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
whenever
he
wishes
and
reappear
unexpectedly
as
a
that
wore
garb
of
yellow
stripes
we
meet
with
another
fairy
musician
and
to
him
says
heaven
grace
again
since
first
i
heard
the
fame
of
them
that
within
the
hills
and
under
the
earth
beneath
us
make
the
fairy
music
music
sweeter
than
thy
strains
i
have
never
heard
thou
art
in
sooth
a
most
melodious
rogue
and
again
it
is
said
of
him
the
taking
a
harp
played
music
so
sweet
and
the
king
after
a
momentary
glance
at
his
own
musicians
never
knew
which
way
he
went
from
him
social
organization
and
warfare
among
the
so
far
we
have
seen
only
the
happy
side
of
the
life
of
the
their
palaces
and
pleasures
and
music
but
there
was
a
more
human
or
anthropomorphic
side
to
their
nature
in
which
they
wage
war
on
one
another
and
have
their
matrimonial
troubles
even
as
we
moderns
and
we
turn
now
to
examine
this
other
side
of
their
life
to
behold
the
as
a
warlike
race
and
as
we
do
so
let
us
remember
that
the
in
the
ben
bulbin
country
and
in
all
ireland
and
the
people
of
finvara
in
knock
ma
and
also
the
invisible
races
of
california
are
likewise
described
as
given
to
war
and
mighty
feats
of
arms
the
invisible
irish
races
have
always
had
a
very
distinct
social
organization
so
distinct
in
fact
that
ireland
can
be
divided
according
to
its
fairy
kings
and
fairy
queens
and
their
territories
even
now
and
no
doubt
we
see
in
this
how
the
ancient
irish
anthropomorphically
projected
into
an
animistic
belief
their
own
social
conditions
and
racial
characteristics
and
this
social
organization
and
territorial
division
ought
to
be
understood
before
we
discuss
the
social
troubles
and
consequent
wars
of
the
for
example
in
munster
bodb
was
king
and
his
enchanted
palace
was
called
the
of
the
men
of
femen
and
we
already
know
about
the
dagda
and
his
boyne
palace
near
tara
in
more
modern
times
especially
in
popular
eevil
or
eevinn
or
of
the
or
grey
rock
is
a
queen
of
the
munster
fairies
and
finvara
is
king
of
the
connaught
fairies
see
there
are
also
the
irish
cleeona
or
in
an
earlier
form
cf
and
aine
see
above
we
are
now
prepared
to
see
the
tuatha
de
danann
in
their
domestic
troubles
and
wars
and
the
following
story
is
as
interesting
as
any
for
in
it
dagda
himself
is
the
chief
actor
once
when
his
own
son
oengus
fell
sick
of
a
love
malady
king
dagda
who
ruled
all
the
in
ireland
joined
forces
with
ailill
and
medb
in
order
to
compel
ethal
anbual
to
deliver
up
his
beautiful
daughter
caer
whom
oengus
loved
when
ethal
anbual
palace
had
been
stormed
and
ethal
anbual
reduced
to
submission
he
declared
he
had
no
power
over
his
daughter
caer
for
on
the
first
of
november
each
year
he
said
she
changed
to
a
swan
or
from
a
swan
to
a
maiden
again
first
of
november
next
he
added
daughter
will
be
under
the
form
of
a
swan
near
the
loch
bel
draccon
marvellous
birds
will
be
seen
there
my
daughter
will
be
surrounded
by
a
hundred
and
fifty
other
swans
when
the
november
day
arrived
oengus
went
to
the
lake
and
seeing
the
swans
and
recognizing
caer
plunged
into
the
water
and
instantly
became
a
swan
with
her
while
under
the
form
of
swans
oengus
and
caer
went
together
to
the
boyne
palace
of
the
king
dagda
his
father
and
remained
there
and
their
singing
was
so
sweet
that
all
who
heard
it
slept
three
days
and
three
nights
in
this
story
new
elements
in
the
nature
of
the
appear
though
like
modern
ones
the
are
able
to
assume
other
forms
than
their
own
are
subject
to
enchantments
like
mortals
and
when
under
the
form
of
swans
are
in
some
perhaps
superficial
aspects
like
the
in
stories
which
are
and
their
has
the
same
sweetness
and
magical
effect
as
in
other
countries
in
the
rennes
there
is
a
tale
about
a
war
among
the
of
the
elfmounds
over
lovable
maidens
who
dwelt
in
the
elfmound
and
when
they
delivered
the
battle
all
shaped
themselves
into
the
shapes
of
deer
midir
sons
under
donn
mac
midir
in
rebellion
against
the
daghda
son
bodh
derg
fled
away
to
an
obscure
where
in
yearly
battle
they
met
the
hosts
of
the
other
tuatha
de
danann
under
bodh
derg
and
it
was
into
this
or
fairy
palace
on
the
very
eve
before
the
annual
contest
that
finn
and
his
six
companions
were
enticed
by
the
fairy
woman
in
the
form
of
a
fawn
to
secure
their
aid
and
in
another
tale
laeghaire
son
of
the
king
of
connaught
with
fifty
warriors
plunged
into
a
lake
to
the
fairy
world
beneath
it
in
order
to
assist
the
fairy
man
who
came
thence
to
them
to
recover
his
wife
stolen
by
a
rival
the
as
or
the
it
is
in
the
form
of
birds
that
certain
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
appear
as
and
directors
of
battle
and
we
learn
from
one
of
our
witnesses
that
the
or
modern
take
sides
even
now
in
a
great
war
like
that
between
japan
and
russia
it
is
in
their
relation
to
the
hero
cuchulainn
that
one
can
best
study
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
in
their
rôle
as
controllers
of
human
war
in
the
greatest
of
the
irish
epics
the
bó
where
cuchulainn
is
under
their
influence
these
are
called
or
which
here
seems
to
be
a
collective
term
for
and
or
each
of
whom
exercises
a
particular
supernatural
power
appears
as
the
confounder
of
armies
so
that
friendly
bands
bereft
of
their
senses
by
her
slaughter
one
another
is
a
fury
that
riots
and
revels
among
the
slain
while
the
greatest
of
the
three
by
her
presence
infuses
superhuman
valour
into
cuchulainn
nerves
him
for
the
cast
and
guides
the
course
of
his
unerring
spear
and
the
tuatha
de
danann
in
infusing
this
valour
into
the
great
hero
show
themselves
as
we
already
know
them
to
be
on
eve
the
rulers
of
all
sorts
of
demons
of
the
air
and
awful
spirits
in
the
of
fol
b
it
is
recorded
that
satyrs
and
sprites
and
maniacs
of
the
valleys
and
demons
of
the
air
shouted
about
him
for
the
tuatha
de
danann
were
wont
to
impart
their
valour
to
him
in
order
that
he
might
be
more
feared
more
dreaded
more
terrible
in
every
battle
and
in
every
combat
and
conflict
into
which
he
went
the
battles
of
moytura
seem
in
most
ways
to
be
nothing
more
than
the
traditional
record
of
a
long
warfare
to
determine
the
future
spiritual
control
of
ireland
carried
on
between
two
diametrically
opposed
orders
of
invisible
beings
the
tuatha
de
danann
representing
the
gods
of
light
and
good
and
the
fomorians
representing
the
gods
of
darkness
and
evil
it
is
said
that
after
the
second
of
these
battles
daughter
of
ernmas
the
irish
proceeded
to
proclaim
that
battle
and
the
mighty
victory
which
had
taken
place
to
the
royal
heights
of
ireland
and
to
its
fairy
host
and
its
chief
waters
and
its
for
good
had
prevailed
over
evil
and
it
was
settled
that
all
ireland
should
for
ever
afterwards
be
a
sacred
country
ruled
over
by
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
and
the
sons
of
mil
jointly
so
that
here
we
see
the
tuatha
de
danann
with
their
fighting
their
own
battles
in
which
human
beings
play
no
part
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
this
irish
the
or
considered
of
old
to
be
one
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
has
survived
to
our
own
day
in
the
of
the
chief
celtic
countries
in
ireland
the
survival
is
best
seen
in
the
popular
and
still
almost
general
belief
among
the
peasantry
that
the
fairies
often
exercise
their
magical
powers
under
the
form
of
and
for
this
reason
these
birds
are
always
greatly
dreaded
and
avoided
the
resting
of
one
of
them
on
a
peasant
cottage
may
signify
many
things
but
often
it
means
the
death
of
one
of
the
family
or
some
great
misfortune
the
bird
in
such
a
case
playing
the
part
of
a
banshee
and
this
finds
its
echo
in
the
recorded
tales
of
wales
scotland
and
brittany
in
the
of
rhonabwy
owain
prince
of
rheged
and
a
contemporary
of
arthur
has
a
wonderful
crow
which
always
secures
him
victory
in
battle
by
the
aid
of
three
hundred
other
crows
under
its
leadership
in
campbell
tales
of
the
west
the
fairies
very
often
exercise
their
power
in
the
form
of
the
common
hoody
crow
and
in
brittany
there
is
a
entitled
in
which
the
chief
actor
is
a
fairy
under
the
form
of
a
magpie
who
lives
in
a
royal
forest
just
outside
rennes
hennessy
has
shown
that
the
word
or
aspirated
or
pronounced
or
originally
signified
rage
fury
or
violence
and
ultimately
implied
a
witch
fairy
or
goddess
and
that
as
the
memory
of
this
irish
goddess
of
war
survives
in
her
emblem
is
the
or
by
referring
to
peter
we
are
able
to
confirm
this
popular
belief
which
identifies
the
with
the
and
to
discover
that
there
is
a
definite
relationship
or
even
identification
between
the
and
the
or
banshee
as
there
is
in
modern
irish
between
the
and
the
fairy
who
announces
a
death
is
made
to
equal
a
a
squall
crow
is
defined
as
a
a
female
fairy
phantom
or
spectre
supposed
to
be
attached
to
certain
families
and
to
appear
sometimes
in
the
form
of
or
and
the
in
the
aspect
is
thus
explained
a
the
great
fairy
catha
nó
feannóg
a
badb
or
similar
explanations
are
given
by
other
glossarists
and
thus
the
evidence
of
etymological
scholarship
as
well
as
that
of
support
the
psychological
theory
the
in
the
battle
of
clontarf
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
played
an
important
part
in
human
warfare
even
so
late
as
the
battle
of
clontarf
fought
near
dublin
april
and
at
that
time
fairy
women
and
were
to
the
irish
unquestionable
existences
as
real
as
ordinary
men
and
women
it
is
recorded
in
the
manuscript
story
of
the
battle
of
which
numerous
copies
exist
that
the
fairy
woman
aoibheall
came
to
dunlang
before
the
battle
and
begged
him
not
to
fight
promising
him
life
and
happiness
for
two
hundred
years
if
he
would
put
off
fighting
for
a
single
day
but
the
patriotic
irishman
expressed
his
decision
to
fight
for
ireland
and
then
the
fairy
woman
foretold
how
he
and
his
friend
murrough
and
brian
and
conaing
and
all
the
nobles
of
erin
and
even
his
own
son
turlough
were
fated
to
fall
in
the
conflict
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
dunlang
comes
to
his
friend
murrough
directly
from
the
fairy
woman
and
murrough
upon
seeing
him
reproaches
him
for
his
absence
in
these
words
must
be
the
love
and
attachment
of
some
woman
for
thee
which
has
induced
thee
to
abandon
me
o
king
answered
dunlang
delight
which
i
have
abandoned
for
thee
is
greater
if
thou
didst
but
know
it
namely
life
without
death
without
cold
without
thirst
without
hunger
without
decay
beyond
any
delight
of
the
delights
of
the
earth
to
me
until
the
judgement
and
heaven
after
the
judgement
and
if
i
had
not
pledged
my
word
to
thee
i
would
not
have
come
here
and
moreover
it
is
fated
for
me
to
die
on
the
day
that
thou
shalt
die
when
murrough
has
heard
this
terrible
message
the
prophecy
of
his
own
death
in
the
battle
despondency
seizes
him
and
then
it
is
that
he
declares
that
he
for
ireland
like
dunlang
for
honour
has
also
sacrificed
the
opportunity
of
entering
and
living
in
that
wonderful
land
of
eternal
youth
was
i
offered
in
hills
and
in
fairy
mansions
this
world
the
fairy
world
and
these
gifts
but
i
never
abandoned
for
one
night
my
country
nor
mine
inheritance
for
them
and
thus
is
described
the
meeting
of
the
two
armies
at
clontarf
and
the
demons
of
the
air
and
the
phantoms
and
all
the
hosts
of
the
invisible
world
who
were
assembled
to
scatter
confusion
and
to
revel
in
the
bloodshed
and
how
above
them
in
supremacy
rose
the
will
be
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
day
of
judgement
to
relate
the
description
of
this
tremendous
onset
there
arose
a
wild
impetuous
precipitate
mad
inexorable
furious
dark
lacerating
merciless
combative
contentious
which
was
shrieking
and
fluttering
over
their
heads
and
there
arose
also
the
satyrs
and
sprites
and
the
maniacs
of
the
valleys
and
the
witches
and
goblins
and
owls
and
destroying
demons
of
the
air
and
firmament
and
the
demoniac
phantom
host
and
they
were
inciting
and
sustaining
valour
and
battle
with
them
it
is
said
of
murrough
as
he
entered
the
thick
of
the
fight
and
prepared
to
assail
the
foreign
invaders
the
danes
when
they
had
repulsed
the
that
was
seized
with
a
boiling
terrible
anger
an
excessive
elevation
and
greatness
of
spirit
and
mind
a
bird
of
valour
and
championship
rose
in
him
and
fluttered
over
his
head
and
on
his
breath
conclusion
the
recorded
or
manuscript
of
the
gaels
corresponds
in
all
essentials
with
the
living
gaelic
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
the
the
people
and
the
of
peace
are
described
as
a
race
of
invisible
divine
beings
eternally
young
and
unfading
they
inhabit
fairy
palaces
enjoy
rare
feasts
and
and
have
their
own
music
and
minstrelsy
they
are
essentially
majestic
in
their
nature
they
wage
war
in
their
own
invisible
realm
against
other
of
its
inhabitants
like
the
ancient
fomorians
they
frequently
direct
human
warfare
or
nerve
the
arm
of
a
great
hero
like
cuchulainn
and
demons
of
the
air
spirit
hosts
and
awful
unseen
creatures
obey
them
mythologically
they
are
gods
of
light
and
good
able
to
control
natural
phenomena
so
as
to
make
harvests
come
forth
abundantly
or
not
at
all
but
they
are
not
such
mythological
beings
as
we
read
about
in
scholarly
dissertations
on
mythology
dissertations
so
learned
in
their
curious
and
unreasonable
and
often
unintelligible
hypotheses
about
the
workings
of
the
mind
among
primitive
men
the
way
in
which
social
psychology
has
deeply
affected
all
such
animistic
beliefs
was

and
arthurian
mythology
as
we
have
just
considered
the
gaelic
divinities
in
their
character
as
the
of
popular
gaelic
tradition
so
now
we
proceed
to
consider
the
brythonic
divinities
in
the
same
way
beginning
with
the
greatest
of
them
all
arthur
even
a
superficial
acquaintance
with
the
arthurian
legend
shows
how
impossible
it
is
to
place
upon
it
any
one
interpretation
to
the
exclusion
of
other
interpretations
for
in
one
aspect
arthur
is
a
brythonic
divinity
and
in
another
a
brythonic
chieftain
but
the
explanation
of
this
double
aspect
seems
easy
enough
when
we
regard
the
historical
arthur
as
a
great
hero
who
exactly
as
in
so
many
parallel
cases
of
national
came
within
a
comparatively
short
time
to
be
enshrined
in
the
imagination
of
the
patriotic
brythons
with
all
the
attributes
anciently
belonging
to
a
great
celtic
god
called
arthur
the
hero
and
the
god
were
first
confused
and
then
identified
and
hence
arose
that
wonderful
body
of
romance
which
we
call
arthurian
and
which
has
become
the
glory
of
english
literature
arthur
in
the
character
of
a
culture
hero
with
powers
to
instruct
mortals
in
wisdom
and
also
as
a
being
in
some
way
related
to
the
sun
as
a
perhaps
can
well
be
considered
the
institutor
of
the
mystic
brotherhood
known
as
the
round
table
we
ought
probably
to
consider
arthur
like
cuchulainn
as
a
god
incarnate
in
a
human
body
for
the
purpose
of
educating
the
race
of
men
and
thus
while
living
as
a
man
related
definitely
and
apparently
consciously
to
the
invisible
gods
or
among
the
aztecs
and
peruvians
in
the
new
world
there
was
a
widespread
belief
that
great
heroes
who
had
once
been
men
have
now
their
celestial
abode
in
the
sun
and
from
time
to
time
reincarnate
to
become
teachers
of
their
less
developed
brethren
of
our
own
race
and
a
belief
of
the
same
character
existed
among
the
egyptians
and
other
peoples
of
the
old
world
including
the
celts
it
will
be
further
shown
in
our
study
of
the
celtic
doctrine
of
that
anciently
among
the
gaels
and
brythons
such
heroes
as
cuchulainn
and
arthur
were
also
considered
reincarnate
as
a
being
related
to
the
sun
as
a
arthur
is
like
osiris
the
great
being
who
with
his
brotherhood
of
great
heroes
and
enters
daily
the
underworld
or
hades
to
battle
against
the
demons
and
forces
of
evil
even
as
the
tuatha
de
danann
battled
against
the
fomors
and
the
most
important
things
in
the
traditions
of
the
great
brythonic
hero
connect
him
directly
with
this
strange
world
of
subjectivity
first
of
all
his
own
father
uthr
bendragon
was
a
king
of
hades
so
that
arthur
himself
being
his
child
is
a
direct
descendant
of
this
otherworld
second
the
arthurian
legend
traces
the
origin
of
the
round
table
back
to
arthur
father
hades
being
realm
whence
all
culture
was
fabled
to
have
been
derived
third
the
name
of
arthur
wife
gwenhwyvar
resolves
itself
into
white
phantom
or
white
apparition
in
harmony
with
arthur
line
of
descent
from
the
region
of
phantoms
and
apparitions
and
thus
or
equals
or
a
brythonic
word
meaning
white
and
a
word
not
found
in
the
brythonic
dialects
but
undoubtedly
cognate
with
the
irish
word
a
fairy
equal
to
a
fairy
or
ghost
the
welsh
and
the
irish
word
going
back
to
the
form
hence
the
name
of
arthur
wife
means
the
or
quite
in
keeping
with
the
nature
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
that
of
the
of
wales
or
the
family
fourth
as
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
connecting
arthur
with
the
invisible
world
where
the
live
his
own
sister
is
called
le
in
the
romances
and
is
thus
definitely
one
of
the
fairy
women
who
according
to
tradition
are
inhabitants
of
the
celtic
otherworld
sometimes
known
as
avalon
fifth
in
the
welsh
triads
llacheu
the
son
of
arthur
and
gwenhwyvar
is
credited
with
clairvoyant
vision
like
the
so
that
he
understands
the
secret
nature
of
all
solid
and
material
things
and
story
of
his
death
as
given
in
the
second
part
of
the
welsh
version
of
the
grail
makes
him
hardly
human
at
all
sixth
the
name
of
melwas
the
abductor
of
wife
is
shown
by
sir
john
rhŷs
to
mean
a
or
a
princely
youth
and
the
same
authority
considers
it
probable
that
as
such
melwas
or
maelwas
was
a
being
endowed
with
eternal
youth
even
as
midir
the
king
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
who
though
a
thousand
years
old
appeared
handsome
and
youthful
so
it
seems
that
the
abduction
of
gwenhwyfar
was
really
a
fairy
abduction
such
as
we
read
about
in
the
domestic
troubles
of
the
irish
on
a
level
with
the
abduction
of
etain
by
her
otherworld
husband
midir
and
in
keeping
with
this
superhuman
character
of
the
abductor
of
the
white
phantom
or
fairy
chrétien
de
troyes
in
his
metrical
romance
conte
de
la
describes
the
realm
of
which
melwas
was
lord
as
a
place
whence
no
traveller
returns
as
further
proof
that
the
realm
of
melwas
was
meant
by
chrétien
to
be
the
subjective
world
where
the
tuatha
de
danann
the
and
the
shades
of
the
dead
equally
exist
it
is
said
that
access
to
it
was
by
two
narrow
bridges
called
ponz
or
the
water
bridge
because
it
was
a
narrow
passage
a
foot
and
a
half
wide
and
as
much
in
height
with
water
above
and
below
it
as
well
as
on
both
sides
the
other
ponz
de
or
the
sword
bridge
because
it
consisted
of
the
edge
of
a
sword
two
lances
in
length
the
first
bridge
considered
less
perilous
than
the
other
was
chosen
by
gauvain
gwalchmei
when
with
lancelot
he
was
seeking
to
rescue
gwenhwyfar
but
he
failed
to
cross
it
lancelot
with
great
trouble
crossed
the
second
in
many
mythologies
and
in
there
is
a
narrow
bridge
or
bridges
leading
to
the
realm
of
the
dead
even
mohammed
in
the
declares
it
necessary
to
cross
a
bridge
as
thin
as
a
hair
if
one
would
enter
paradise
and
in
living
in
celtic
countries
as
we
found
among
the
irish
peasantry
the
crossing
of
a
bridge
or
stream
of
water
when
pursued
by
fairies
or
phantoms
is
a
guarantee
of
protection
there
is
always
the
mystic
water
between
the
realm
of
the
living
and
the
realm
of
subjectivity
in
ancient
egypt
there
was
always
the
last
voyage
begun
on
the
sacred
nile
and
in
all
classical
literature
pluto
realm
is
entered
by
crossing
a
dark
deep
river
the
river
of
forgetfulness
between
physical
consciousness
and
spiritual
consciousness
burns
has
expressed
this
belief
in
its
popular
form
in
his
and
in
our
arthurian
parallel
there
is
a
clear
enough
relation
between
the
beings
inhabiting
the
invisible
realm
and
the
brythonic
heroes
and
gods
how
striking
too
as
gaston
paris
has
pointed
out
is
the
similarity
between
capturing
gwenhwyvar
as
she
was
in
the
woods
and
the
rape
of
proserpine
by
pluto
the
god
of
hades
while
she
was
collecting
flowers
in
the
fields
a
curious
matter
in
connexion
with
this
episode
of
abduction
should
claim
our
attention
malory
relates
that
when
queen
guenever
advised
her
knights
of
the
table
round
that
on
the
morrow
may
day
when
fairies
have
special
powers
she
would
go
on
maying
she
warned
them
all
to
be
and
in
this
was
the
colour
that
nearly
all
the
of
britain
and
ireland
wear
it
symbolizes
as
many
ancient
mystical
writings
declare
eternal
youth
and
resurrection
or
as
in
nature
during
the
springtime
when
all
vegetation
after
its
of
winter
springs
into
new
life
in
the
arthur
when
he
has
reached
the
realm
of
melwas
speaks
with
gwenhwyvar
he
being
on
a
black
horse
and
she
on
a
green
one
is
my
steed
of
the
tint
of
the
leaves
arthur
black
horse
black
perhaps
signifying
the
dead
to
whose
realm
he
has
gone
being
proof
against
all
water
may
have
been
therefore
proof
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
of
shades
and
against
fairies
black
is
my
steed
and
brave
beneath
me
no
water
will
make
him
fear
and
no
man
will
make
him
swerve
the
fairy
colour
in
different
works
and
among
different
authors
differing
both
in
time
and
country
continues
to
attach
itself
to
the
abduction
episode
thus
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
poet
ab
gwilym
alludes
to
melwas
himself
as
having
a
cloak
of
green
sleep
of
melwas
beneath
or
in
the
green
cloak
sir
john
rhŷs
who
makes
this
translation
observes
that
another
reading
still
of
glas
resolves
it
into
a
green
bower
to
which
melwas
took
gwenhwyvar
in
any
case
the
reference
is
significant
and
goes
far
in
combination
with
the
other
references
to
represent
the
white
phantom
or
fairy
and
her
lover
melwas
as
beings
of
a
race
like
the
irish
or
people
of
the
goddess
dana
and
though
by
no
means
exhausting
all
examples
tending
to
prove
this
point
we
pass
on
to
the
seventh
and
most
important
of
our
links
in
the
sequence
of
evidence
the
carrying
of
arthur
to
avalon
in
a
fairy
ship
by
fairy
women
from
the
first
arthur
was
under
superhuman
guidance
and
protection
merlin
the
magician
born
of
a
spirit
or
daemon
claimed
arthur
before
birth
and
became
his
teacher
afterwards
from
the
mysterious
lady
of
the
lake
arthur
received
his
magic
sword
and
to
her
returned
it
through
sir
bedivere
during
all
his
time
on
earth
the
of
the
lake
that
was
always
friendly
to
king
arthur
watched
over
him
and
once
when
she
saw
him
in
great
danger
like
the
irish
who
presided
over
the
career
of
cuchulainn
she
sought
to
save
him
and
with
the
help
of
sir
tristram
succeeded
the
passing
of
arthur
to
avalon
or
faerie
seems
to
be
a
return
to
his
own
native
realm
of
subjectivity
his
own
sister
was
with
him
in
the
ship
for
she
was
of
the
invisible
country
too
and
another
of
his
companions
on
his
voyage
from
the
visible
to
the
invisible
was
his
nimue
the
lady
of
the
lake
merlin
could
not
be
of
the
company
for
he
was
already
in
faerie
with
the
fay
vivian
behold
the
passing
of
arthur
as
malory
describes
it
thus
was
he
led
away
in
a
ship
wherein
were
three
queens
that
one
was
king
arthur
sister
queen
morgan
le
fay
the
other
was
the
queen
of
northgalis
the
third
was
the
queen
of
the
waste
lands
also
there
was
nimue
the
chief
lady
of
the
lake
that
had
wedded
pelleas
the
good
knight
and
this
lady
had
done
much
for
king
arthur
for
she
would
never
suffer
sir
pelleas
to
be
in
no
place
where
he
should
be
in
danger
of
his
life
concerning
the
great
return
from
avalon
we
shall
speak
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
and
we
pass
now
from
arthur
and
his
brotherhood
of
gods
and
to
lancelot
and
his
son
galahad
the
two
chief
knights
in
the
arthurian
romance
according
to
one
of
the
earliest
accounts
we
have
of
lancelot
the
german
poem
by
ulrich
von
zatzikhoven
as
analysed
by
gaston
paris
he
was
the
son
of
king
pant
and
queen
clarine
of
genewis
in
consequence
of
the
hatred
of
their
subjects
the
royal
pair
were
forced
to
flee
when
lancelot
was
only
a
year
old
during
the
flight
the
king
mortally
wounded
died
and
just
as
the
queen
was
about
to
be
taken
captive
a
fairy
rising
in
a
cloud
of
mist
carried
away
the
infant
lancelot
from
where
his
parents
had
placed
him
under
a
tree
the
fairy
took
him
to
her
abode
on
an
island
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
from
whence
she
derived
her
title
of
lady
of
the
lake
and
he
as
her
adopted
son
the
name
of
du
and
her
was
called
the
land
of
maidens
having
lived
in
that
world
of
faerie
so
long
it
was
only
natural
that
lancelot
should
have
grown
up
more
like
one
of
its
than
like
a
mortal
no
doubt
it
was
on
account
of
his
nature
that
he
fell
in
love
with
the
white
phantom
gwenhwyvar
the
wife
of
the
king
who
had
power
to
enter
hades
and
return
again
to
the
land
of
the
living
who
better
than
lancelot
could
have
rescued
arthur
queen
no
one
else
in
the
court
was
so
well
fitted
for
the
task
and
it
was
he
who
was
able
to
cross
one
of
the
magic
bridges
into
the
realm
of
melwas
the
otherworld
while
gauvain
in
the
english
form
gawayne
failed
malory
narrative
records
how
lancelot
while
suffering
from
the
malady
of
madness
caused
by
gwenhwyvar
jealous
expulsion
of
elayne
his
quite
a
parallel
case
to
that
of
cuchulainn
when
his
wife
emer
expelled
his
fand
fought
against
a
wild
boar
and
was
terribly
wounded
and
how
afterwards
he
was
nursed
by
his
own
elayne
in
fairyland
and
healed
and
restored
to
his
right
mind
by
the
sangreal
then
sir
ector
and
sir
perceval
found
him
there
in
the
joyous
isle
enjoying
the
companionship
of
elayne
where
he
had
been
many
years
and
from
that
world
of
faerie
induced
him
to
return
to
arthur
court
and
finally
comes
the
most
important
element
of
all
to
show
how
closely
related
lancelot
is
with
the
fairy
world
and
its
people
and
how
inseparable
from
that
invisible
realm
another
of
the
fundamental
elements
in
the
life
of
arthur
is
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
and
the
story
of
galahad
who
of
all
the
knights
was
pure
and
good
enough
to
behold
the
sacred
vessel
and
who
was
the
offspring
of
the
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
the
fairy
woman
elayne
in
the
strange
old
welsh
tale
of
and
we
find
arthur
and
his
knights
even
more
closely
identified
with
the
fairy
realm
than
in
malory
and
the
writers
and
this
is
important
because
the
ancient
tale
is
as
scholars
think
probably
much
freer
from
foreign
influences
and
than
the
romances
of
arthur
and
therefore
more
in
accord
with
genuine
celtic
beliefs
and
as
we
shall
quickly
see
the
court
of
king
arthur
to
which
the
youth
kulhwch
goes
seeking
aid
in
his
enterprise
seems
in
some
ways
though
the
parallel
is
not
complete
enough
to
be
emphasized
to
be
a
more
artistic
because
literary
picture
of
that
fairy
court
which
the
celtic
peasant
locates
under
mountains
in
caverns
in
hills
and
in
knolls
a
court
quite
comparable
to
that
of
the
irish
or
tuatha
de
danann
arthur
is
represented
in
the
midst
of
a
brilliant
life
where
as
in
the
fairy
palaces
there
is
much
feasting
and
kulhwch
being
invited
to
the
feasting
says
came
not
here
to
consume
meat
and
drink
and
behold
what
sort
of
personages
from
that
court
kulhwch
has
pledged
to
him
so
that
by
their
supernatural
assistance
he
may
obtain
olwen
herself
perhaps
a
fairy
held
under
fairy
enchantment
the
sons
of
gwawrddur
kyrvach
whom
arthur
had
power
to
call
from
the
confines
of
hell
morvran
the
son
of
tegid
who
because
of
his
ugliness
was
thought
to
be
a
demon
sandde
bryd
angel
who
was
so
beautiful
that
mortals
thought
him
a
ministering
angel
henbedestyr
with
whom
no
one
could
keep
pace
on
horseback
or
on
foot
and
who
therefore
seems
to
be
a
spirit
of
the
air
henwas
adeinawg
with
whom
beast
could
run
the
distance
of
an
acre
much
less
go
beyond
it
sgilti
yscawndroed
who
must
have
been
another
spirit
or
fairy
for
he
intended
to
go
on
a
message
for
his
lord
arthur
who
is
like
a
tuatha
de
danann
king
he
never
sought
to
find
a
path
but
knowing
whither
he
was
to
go
if
his
way
lay
through
a
wood
he
went
along
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
his
whole
life
a
blade
of
bent
not
beneath
his
feet
much
less
did
one
ever
break
so
lightly
did
he
tread
gwallgoyc
who
he
came
to
a
town
though
there
were
three
hundred
houses
in
it
if
he
wanted
anything
he
would
not
let
sleep
come
to
the
eyes
of
any
whilst
he
remained
there
osla
gyllellvawr
who
bore
a
short
broad
dagger
and
arthur
and
his
hosts
came
before
a
torrent
they
would
seek
for
a
narrow
place
where
they
might
pass
the
water
and
would
lay
the
sheathed
dagger
across
the
torrent
and
it
would
form
a
bridge
sufficient
for
the
armies
of
the
three
islands
of
britain
and
of
the
three
islands
adjacent
with
their
spoil
it
seems
very
evident
that
this
is
the
magic
bridge
so
often
typified
by
a
sword
or
dagger
which
connects
the
world
invisible
with
our
own
and
over
which
all
shades
and
spirits
pass
freely
to
and
fro
in
this
case
we
think
arthur
is
very
clearly
a
ruler
of
the
spirit
realm
for
like
the
great
tuatha
de
danann
king
dagda
he
can
command
its
inhabitants
and
his
army
is
an
army
of
spirits
or
fairies
the
unknown
author
of
like
spenser
in
modern
times
in
his
seems
to
have
made
the
island
of
britain
the
realm
of
faerie
the
celtic
otherworld
and
arthur
its
king
but
let
us
take
a
look
at
more
of
the
men
pledged
to
kulhwch
from
among
followers
clust
the
son
of
clustveinad
who
possessed
clairaudient
faculties
of
so
extraordinary
a
kind
that
he
were
buried
seven
cubits
beneath
the
earth
he
would
hear
the
ant
fifty
miles
off
rise
from
her
nest
in
the
morning
and
the
wonderful
kai
who
could
live
nine
days
and
nine
nights
under
water
for
his
breath
lasted
this
long
and
he
could
exist
the
same
length
of
time
without
sleep
wound
from
kai
sword
no
physician
could
heal
and
at
will
he
was
as
tall
as
the
highest
tree
in
the
forest
he
had
another
peculiarity
so
great
was
the
heat
of
his
nature
that
when
it
rained
hardest
whatever
he
carried
remained
dry
for
a
handbreadth
above
and
a
handbreadth
below
his
hand
and
when
his
companions
were
coldest
it
was
to
them
as
fuel
with
which
to
light
their
fire
yet
besides
all
these
strange
knights
arthur
commanded
a
being
who
is
without
any
reasonable
doubt
a
god
or
ruler
of
the
subjective
realm
ab
nudd
whom
god
has
placed
over
the
brood
of
devils
in
annwn
lest
they
should
destroy
the
present
race
he
will
never
be
spared
thence
whatever
each
one
of
us
may
think
of
this
wonderful
assembly
of
warriors
and
heroes
who
recognized
in
arthur
their
chief
they
are
certainly
not
beings
of
the
ordinary
type
in
fact
they
seem
not
of
this
world
but
of
that
hidden
land
to
which
we
all
shall
one
day
journey
but
to
avoid
too
much
conjecture
and
to
speak
with
a
degree
of
scientific
exactness
as
to
how
arthur
and
these
companions
of
his
are
to
be
considered
let
us
undertake
a
brief
investigation
into
the
mythological
character
and
nature
of
the
chief
one
of
them
next
to
the
great
hero
gwynn
ab
nudd
professor
loth
has
said
that
shows
better
the
evolution
of
mythological
personages
than
the
history
of
gwynn
and
in
irish
we
have
the
equivalent
form
of
nudd
in
the
name
nuada
famous
for
having
had
a
hand
of
silver
and
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
was
a
king
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
the
same
authority
thus
describes
gwynn
the
son
of
nudd
like
his
father
nudd
is
an
ancient
god
of
the
britons
and
of
the
gaels
christian
priests
have
made
of
him
a
demon
the
people
persisted
in
regarding
him
as
a
powerful
and
rich
king
the
sovereign
of
supernatural
beings
and
referring
to
gwynn
professor
loth
in
his
early
edition
of
says
author
has
had
an
original
idea
he
has
left
him
in
hell
to
which
place
christianity
had
made
him
descend
but
for
a
motive
which
does
him
the
greatest
honour
god
has
given
him
the
strength
of
demons
to
control
them
and
to
prevent
them
from
destroying
the
present
race
of
men
he
is
indispensable
down
there
lady
guest
calls
gwynn
the
king
of
faerie
the
ruler
of
the
or
of
beauty
who
are
always
joyful
and
toward
mortals
and
also
the
ruler
of
the
elves
welsh
a
goblin
race
who
take
special
delight
in
misleading
travellers
and
in
playing
mischievous
tricks
on
men
it
is
even
said
that
gwynn
himself
is
given
to
indulging
in
the
same
mischievous
amusements
as
his
elvish
subjects
the
evidence
now
set
forth
seems
to
suggest
clearly
and
even
definitely
that
arthur
in
his
true
nature
is
a
god
of
the
subjective
world
a
ruler
of
ghosts
demons
and
demon
rulers
and
fairies
that
the
people
of
his
court
are
more
like
the
irish
than
like
mortals
and
that
as
a
great
king
he
is
comparable
to
dagda
the
of
all
the
tuatha
de
danann
arthur
and
osiris
two
culture
heroes
and
as
we
suggested
at
first
are
strikingly
parallel
osiris
came
from
the
otherworld
to
this
one
became
the
first
divine
ruler
and
culture
hero
of
egypt
and
then
returned
to
the
otherworld
where
he
is
now
a
king
arthur
father
was
a
ruler
in
the
otherworld
and
arthur
evidently
came
from
there
to
be
the
supreme
champion
of
the
brythons
and
then
returned
to
that
realm
whence
he
took
his
origin
a
realm
which
poets
called
avalon
the
passing
of
arthur
seems
mystically
to
represent
the
sunset
over
the
western
ocean
arthur
disappears
beneath
the
horizon
into
the
lower
world
which
is
also
the
halls
of
osiris
wherein
osiris
journeys
between
sunset
and
sunrise
between
death
and
merlin
found
the
infant
arthur
floating
on
the
waves
the
sun
rising
across
the
waters
is
this
birth
of
arthur
the
birth
of
osiris
in
the
chapter
on
evidence
will
be
offered
to
show
that
as
a
culture
hero
arthur
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
incarnate
in
a
human
body
to
teach
the
brythons
arts
and
sciences
and
hidden
things
even
as
prometheus
and
zeus
are
said
to
have
come
to
earth
to
teach
the
greeks
and
that
as
a
warrior
arthur
in
accordance
with
the
celtic
doctrine
of
is
an
ancient
brythonic
hero
reincarnate
the
literary
evolution
and
the
antiquity
of
the
brythonic
after
the
norman
conquest
of
england
in
the
ancient
of
the
brythons
began
to
exercise
their
remarkable
literary
influence
as
we
see
it
now
in
the
evolution
of
the
arthurian
legend
and
in
this
evolution
of
the
arthurian
legend
we
find
the
proof
of
the
antiquity
of
the
brythonic
just
as
we
find
in
the
old
irish
manuscripts
the
proof
of
the
antiquity
of
the
gaelic
long
before
gildas
gives
the
first
recorded
germs
of
the
arthurian
story
in
his
excidio
et
conquestu
though
they
are
hardly
distinguishable
as
such
his
failure
to
mention
the
name
of
arthur
though
treating
of
the
whole
period
when
arthur
is
supposed
to
have
lived
he
himself
being
contemporary
with
the
period
raises
the
very
difficult
question
which
we
have
already
mentioned
did
the
mighty
brythonic
hero
ever
have
an
actual
historical
existence
almost
three
hundred
years
later
a
period
sufficiently
removed
from
gildas
to
have
made
arthur
the
supreme
champion
of
the
falling
brythons
granting
that
he
did
exist
during
the
sixth
century
as
a
brythonic
chieftain
in
the
completed
about
the
year
and
attributed
to
nennius
arthur
for
the
first
time
in
a
known
manuscript
is
mentioned
as
a
character
of
british
history
all
that
can
be
definitely
said
of
the
narrative
of
nennius
that
it
represents
more
or
less
inconsistent
british
traditions
of
uncertain
age
that
it
is
not
always
historical
many
scholars
are
agreed
fletcher
says
is
always
the
possibility
that
arthur
never
existed
at
all
and
that
even
nennius
comparatively
modest
eulogy
has
no
firmer
foundation
than
the
persistent
stories
of
ancient
celtic
myth
or
the
patriotic
figments
of
the
ardent
celtic
imagination
sir
john
rhŷs
also
propounds
a
similar
view
thus
for
example
nennius
states
that
arthur
in
one
battle
slew
single
handed
more
than
nine
hundred
men
and
again
that
the
number
of
arthur
battles
was
twelve
as
though
arthur
were
the
sun
or
a
and
his
battles
the
twelve
months
of
the
solar
year
between
nennius
and
geoffrey
of
monmouth
there
is
an
intermediate
stage
in
the
development
of
the
arthurian
legend
during
which
the
character
of
arthur
tends
to
become
more
romantic
but
for
our
purpose
this
period
is
of
slight
importance
thereafter
by
means
of
geoffrey
famous
regum
written
about
the
arthurian
legend
gained
popularity
throughout
western
europe
in
this
work
arthur
ceases
to
be
purely
historical
and
appears
as
a
great
king
enveloped
in
the
mythical
atmosphere
of
a
celtic
hero
and
with
him
merlin
and
lear
are
for
the
first
time
definitely
enshrined
in
the
literature
of
britain
arthur
career
is
completely
sketched
in
the
from
birth
to
his
mysterious
departure
for
the
isle
of
avalon
after
the
last
fight
with
modred
when
fairy
women
take
him
to
cure
him
of
his
wounds
book
xi
geoffrey
thus
the
father
of
the
arthurian
legend
in
english
and
european
literature
was
undoubtedly
a
welshman
who
probably
had
natural
opportunities
of
knowing
the
true
character
of
arthur
from
genuine
brythonic
sources
though
we
know
little
about
his
life
his
as
the
researches
of
scholars
have
shown
was
the
sum
total
in
his
time
of
all
arthurian
history
and
myth
whether
written
or
orally
transmitted
which
he
could
collect
just
as
malory
morte
was
a
compendium
of
arthurian
material
in
the
time
of
edward
iv
there
followed
many
imitations
and
translations
of
the
the
most
important
of
these
appeared
in
roman
de
or
story
of
brutus
by
the
norman
poet
wace
the
though
fundamentally
a
rimed
version
of
the
is
much
more
than
a
mere
translation
wace
has
improved
on
it
and
he
gives
a
convincing
impression
that
he
had
access
to
celtic
arthurian
stories
not
drawn
upon
by
geoffrey
for
he
gives
new
touches
about
gawain
mentions
the
britons
expectation
of
arthur
return
from
faerie
and
the
institution
of
the
round
table
somewhere
about
the
year
layamon
a
saxon
priest
wrote
another
based
upon
the
metrical
one
by
wace
and
in
the
literature
of
england
layamon
work
is
the
most
valuable
single
production
between
the
conquest
and
chaucer
the
life
of
layamon
is
very
obscure
but
it
seems
reasonably
certain
that
for
a
long
time
he
lived
on
the
welsh
marches
in
north
worcestershire
in
the
midst
of
living
brythonic
traditions
which
he
used
at
first
hand
and
as
a
result
we
find
in
his
legends
not
recorded
in
geoffrey
or
wace
or
in
any
earlier
or
contemporary
literature
for
our
purposes
the
most
interesting
of
many
interesting
additions
made
by
layamon
are
the
curious
passages
about
the
fairy
elves
at
arthur
birth
and
about
the
way
in
which
arthur
was
taken
by
them
to
their
queen
argante
in
avalon
to
be
cured
of
his
wounds
time
came
that
was
chosen
then
was
arthur
born
so
soon
as
he
came
on
earth
elves
took
him
they
enchanted
the
child
into
magic
most
strong
they
gave
him
might
to
be
the
best
of
all
knights
they
gave
him
another
thing
that
he
should
be
a
rich
king
they
gave
him
the
third
that
he
should
live
long
they
gave
to
him
the
prince
virtues
most
good
so
that
he
was
most
generous
of
all
men
alive
this
the
elves
gave
him
and
thus
the
child
thrived
in
the
last
fatal
battle
modred
is
slain
and
arthur
is
grievously
wounded
as
arthur
lies
wounded
constantine
cador
son
the
earl
of
cornwall
and
a
relative
of
arthur
comes
to
him
arthur
greets
him
with
these
words
constantine
thou
art
welcome
thou
wert
cador
son
i
give
thee
here
my
kingdom
and
i
will
fare
to
avalun
to
the
fairest
of
all
maidens
to
argante
the
queen
and
elf
most
fair
and
she
shall
make
my
wounds
all
sound
make
me
all
whole
with
healing
draughts
and
afterwards
i
will
come
again
to
my
kingdom
and
dwell
with
the
britons
with
mickle
joy
even
with
the
words
there
approached
from
the
sea
that
was
a
short
boat
floating
with
the
waves
and
two
women
therein
wondrously
formed
and
they
took
arthur
anon
and
bare
him
quickly
and
laid
him
softly
down
and
forth
gan
depart
then
it
was
accomplished
that
merlin
whilom
said
that
mickle
care
sorrow
should
be
of
departure
the
britons
believe
that
he
is
alive
and
dwelleth
in
avalun
with
the
fairest
of
all
elves
and
the
britons
even
yet
expect
when
arthur
shall
return
during
this
same
period
giraldus
cambrensis
in
his
book
i
collected
a
popular
otherworld
tale
it
is
about
a
priest
named
elidorus
who
when
a
boy
in
gower
the
western
district
of
glamorganshire
had
free
passage
between
this
world
of
ours
and
an
underground
country
inhabited
by
a
race
of
little
people
who
spoke
a
language
like
greek
this
tends
to
prove
that
the
was
then
flourishing
among
the
people
of
wales
it
was
chiefly
during
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
that
the
arthurian
legend
as
a
thing
of
literature
began
to
take
definite
shape
the
old
romances
of
the
brythons
were
cultivated
and
revised
and
written
down
by
men
and
women
of
literary
genius
chrétien
de
troyes
who
recorded
a
large
number
of
legendary
stories
in
verse
marie
de
france
famous
for
her
thomas
the
author
of
the
chief
version
of
the
legend
béroul
who
recorded
a
less
important
version
of
this
legend
and
robert
de
boron
who
did
much
to
develop
the
legend
of
the
holy
grail
were
among
the
greatest
workers
in
the
french
celtic
revival
of
this
time
professor
brown
has
shown
that
every
incident
in
was
suggested
by
an
ancient
celtic
tale
dealing
with
the
familiar
theme
of
a
journey
to
win
a
fairy
mistress
in
the
otherworld
the
fay
whom
iwain
marries
is
called
laudine
and
like
one
of
the
fairies
who
live
in
sacred
waters
she
has
her
favourite
fountain
which
the
knight
guards
as
though
he
were
the
black
knight
in
the
old
welsh
tale
of
lady
of
the
both
gaston
paris
and
alfred
nutt
have
also
recognized
the
tale
of
as
a
fairy
romance
professor
loth
observes
that
is
not
impossible
that
chrétien
had
known
among
fairy
legends
armorican
legends
concerning
the
fairies
of
waters
whose
rôle
is
identical
with
that
of
the
welsh
in
one
of
the
by
marie
de
france
written
during
the
twelfth
century
probably
while
its
author
was
living
in
england
we
have
direct
proof
that
there
was
then
flourishing
in
brittany
well
known
to
marie
de
france
who
was
french
by
birth
and
training
a
popular
belief
in
fairy
women
who
lived
in
the
otherworld
and
who
could
mortals
on
whom
their
love
fell
it
is
probable
that
the
older
lay
to
which
marie
de
france
refers
in
the
beginning
of
her
may
have
been
the
anonymous
one
of
sometimes
improperly
attributed
to
her
zimmer
and
foerster
place
the
origin
of
in
brittany
and
the
similarity
of
the
heroes
in
the
two
poems
seems
to
be
due
to
a
very
ancient
brythonic
schofield
sees
in
an
older
form
of
the
more
polished
and
remarks
that
the
chief
difference
in
the
two
is
found
in
the
way
the
hero
meets
the
fairy
women
in
the
case
of
lanval
when
he
leaves
the
court
he
goes
to
rest
beside
a
river
where
two
beautiful
maidens
come
to
him
graelent
is
alone
in
the
woods
when
he
sees
a
hind
whiter
than
snow
and
following
it
comes
to
a
place
where
fairy
damsels
are
bathing
in
a
fountain
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
in
both
poems
the
maidens
and
damsels
are
fairies
quite
like
the
tuatha
de
danann
with
power
to
cast
their
spell
over
beautiful
young
men
whom
they
wish
to
have
for
husbands
in
another
of
the
old
breton
lays
ascribed
by
gaston
paris
to
marie
de
france
we
find
again
episodes
similar
to
those
in
and
the
of
marie
de
france
had
many
imitators
in
england
chaucer
too
has
made
it
clear
that
he
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
old
breton
and
their
subjects
or
for
in
the
to
the
frankeleyn
he
writes
thise
olde
gentil
britons
in
hir
dayes
of
diverse
aventures
maden
layes
rymeyed
in
hir
firste
briton
tonge
we
may
now
briefly
examine
in
a
general
way
some
of
the
most
noteworthy
of
the
more
obscure
but
for
us
important
old
french
of
a
kindred
brythonic
or
arthurian
character
called
and
wherein
appear
or
are
mentioned
bel
de
la
et
et
vengeance
and
et
in
these
romances
fairies
commonly
appear
as
most
beautiful
supernormal
women
who
love
mortal
heroes
they
are
seen
chiefly
at
night
frequenting
forests
and
fountains
and
like
all
fairies
disappear
at
or
before
they
are
skilled
in
magic
and
astrology
like
the
greek
fates
some
of
them
spin
and
weave
and
have
great
influence
over
the
lives
of
mankind
they
are
represented
as
relatively
immortal
so
long
is
their
span
of
life
compared
to
ours
but
ultimately
they
seem
to
be
subject
to
a
change
such
as
we
call
death
this
indeed
is
never
specifically
mentioned
only
implied
by
the
statements
that
they
enjoy
childhood
and
then
womanhood
being
thus
created
and
not
eternal
beings
some
are
very
prominent
figures
like
la
arthur
sister
in
most
cases
they
are
beneficent
and
frequently
act
as
guardian
spirits
for
their
special
hero
just
as
the
lake
lady
for
arthur

so
strong
is
the
faith
in
these
that
a
man
meeting
unusual
success
is

that
is
endowed
with
fairy
power
or

like

romance

fairy
haunts
and
he
names
them
as
being
under
the
dominion
of
arthur
who
is
described
as
a
great
fairy
king
such
fairy
romances
as
the
above
and
they
are
but
a
few
examples
selected
from
among
a
vast
number
often
localized
in
brittany
raise
the
perplexing
and
problem
concerning
the
origin
of
the
of
britain
the
most
reasonable
position
to
take
with
respect
to
this
problem
would
seem
to
be
that
celtic
traditions
flourished
wherever
there
were
gaels
and
brythons
that
there
was
much
interchange
of
these
traditions
between
one
celtic
country
and
another
especially
between
wales
and
ireland
and
across
the
channel
between
brittany
and
south
england
including
cornwall
and
wales
both
before
and
after
the
christian
era
further
the
arthurian
based
upon
such
interchanged
celtic
traditions
grew
up
with
a
brythonic
background
chiefly
after
the
norman
conquest
both
in
armorica
and
in
britain
and
became
in
the
later
middle
ages
one
of
the
chief
glories
of
english
and
of
european
literature
in
concluding
this
slight
examination
of
brythonic
we
may
very
briefly
suggest
by
means
of
a
few
selected
examples
what
fairies
are
like
in
the
stories
and
in
the
ancient
books
of
and
the
chief
literary
of
ancient
magical
and
mystical
otherworld
and
fairy
traditions
of
the
brythons
which
we
have
already
considered
in
relation
to
arthur
to
be
built
upon
arthurian
and
other
legends
of
native
growth
unmistakable
welsh
parallels
to
the
irish
appear
in
the
of
pwyll
prince
of
where
the
two
chief
incidents
are
pwyll
journey
to
the
otherworld
after
he
and
arawn
its
ruler
have
exchanged
shapes
and
kingdoms
for
a
year
and
the
marriage
of
pwyll
to
a
fairy
damsel
in
the
of
which
contains
much
magic
and
and
the
description
of
a
fairy
castle
belonging
to
llwyd
and
in
the
of
the
daughter
of
where
there
is
the
episode
of
the
feast
at
harlech
over
the
head
of
bran
during
which
the
birds
of
realm
sing
so
sweetly
that
time
passes
abnormally
fast
the
of
the
four
true
composed
before
the
eleventh
century
is
as
sir
john
rhŷs
has
pointed
out
the
fortunes
of
three
clans
of
superhuman
beings
comparable
to
the
irish
tuatha
de
danann
the
children
of
llyr
the
children
of
don
and
the
family
of
pwyll
herein
then
the
ancient
gaelic
and
brythonic
coincide
and
show
the
unity
of
the
celtic
race
which
evolved
them
in
the
ancient
books
of
which
are
poetical
compositions
whereas
the
tales
are
prose
with
extremely
little
verse
there
are
certain
interesting
passages
to
illustrate
the
ancient
of
the
brythons
from
some
of
its
purest
sources
the
first
selected
example
comes
from
the
book
of
it
is
a
poem
sometimes
called
the
from
among
the
poems
relating
to
the
battle
of
arderydd
and
it
represents
or
merlin
the
famous
magician
of
arthur
quite
at
the
mercy
of
sprites
the
passage
is
an
interesting
one
as
showing
that
in
the
region
where
merlin
is
supposed
to
be
under
the
enchantment
of
the
fairy
woman
vivian
he
was
regarded
as
no
longer
able
to
exercise
his
wonted
control
over
spirits
like
fairies
as
in
ancient
belief
where
the
loss
of
chastity
in
a
magician
that
is
to
say
in
one
able
to
command
certain
orders
of
invisible
beings
always
leads
to
his
falling
under
their
lawless
power
so
was
it
with
merlin
when
overcome
by
vivian
and
this
is
merlin
lamentation
ten
years
and
forty
as
the
toy
of
lawless
ones
have
i
been
wandering
in
gloom
among
sprites
after
wealth
in
abundance
and
entertaining
minstrels
i
have
been
here
so
long
that
it
is
useless
for
gloom
and
sprites
to
lead
me
astray
in
a
dialogue
between
myrddin
and
his
sister
gwenddydd
contained
in
the
book
of
hergest
there
is
a
curious
reference
to
ghosts
of
the
mountain
who
just
like
fairies
that
live
in
the
mountains
steal
away
men
reason
when
they
them
in
death
which
may
appear
natural
in
sickness
or
in
accident
and
after
his
death
after
he
has
been
by
these
ghosts
of
the
mountain
myrddin
returns
as
a
ghost
and
speaks
from
the
grave
a
prophecy
which
ghost
of
the
mountain
in
aber
carav
told
him
not
only
do
these
passages
prove
the
celtic
belief
in
ghosts
like
fairies
to
have
existed
anciently
in
wales
but
they
show
also
that
the
recorded
of
the
brythons
like
that
of
the
gaels
of
ireland
and
scotland
directly
attests
and
confirms
our
psychological
theory
like
a
record
from
the
official
proceedings
of
the
psychical
research
society
itself
they
form
one
of
the
strongest
proofs
that
fairies
ghosts
and
shades
were
confused
all
alike
in
the
mind
of
the
welsh
poet
mingling
together
in
that
realm
where
mortals
see
with
a
new
vision
and
exist
with
a
body
invisible
to
us
our
study
of
the
literary
evolution
of
the
brythonic
shows
that
as
early
as
about
the
year
arthurian
traditions
were
known
though
possibly
arthur
himself
never
had
historical
existence
by
about
when
geoffrey
famous
appeared
these
traditions
were
already
highly
developed
in
britain
and
arthur
had
become
a
great
brythonic
hero
enveloped
in
a
halo
of
romance
and
myth
and
as
an
otherworld
being
was
definitely
related
to
avalon
and
its
fairy
inhabitants
this
new
literary
material
of
celtic
origin
opened
up
to
europe
by
geoffrey
rapidly
began
to
influence
profoundly
the
form
of
continental
as
well
as
english
poetry
and
prose
chiefly
through
the
writers
of
the
period
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
in
itself
it
was
in
no
wise
essentially
different
from
what
we
find
as
fairy
romances
in
the
old
irish
manuscripts
written
during
the
same
and
earlier
periods
welsh
literature
however
it
may
be
related
to
irish
shows
a
common
origin
with
it
the
four
true
as
stories
are
earlier
than
and
in
its
present
form
most
probably
dates
from
the
latter
half
of
the
twelfth
century
the
ancient
books
of
date
from
the
twelfth
to
the
fifteenth
centuries
as
manuscripts
in
both
ancient
and
modern
times
there
was
much
interchange
of
material
between
irish
gaels
and
brythons
and
brittany
as
well
as
britain
and
ireland
undoubtedly
contributed
to
the
evolution
of
the
complex
fairy
romances
which
formed
the
germ
of
the
arthurian
legend
when
we
stop
to
consider
how
long
it
may
have
taken
the
brythonic
as
well
as
that
of
the
gaels
to
become
so
widespread
and
popular
among
the
celtic
peoples
that
it
could
take
such
definite
shape
as
it
now
shows
in
all
the
oldest
manuscripts
in
different
languages
we
can
easily
wander
backward

enlightenment
and
civilization

here
on

as
it
was
necessarily
a
subjective
world
poets
could
only
describe
it
in
terms
more
or
less
vague
and
its
exact
geographical
location
accordingly
differed
widely
in
the
minds
of
scribes
from
century
to
century
sometimes
as
is
usual
in
it
was
a
subterranean
world
entered
through
caverns
or
hills
or
mountains
and
inhabited
by
many
races
and
orders
of
invisible
beings
such
as
demons
shades
fairies
or
even
gods
and
the
underground
world
of
the
which
can
not
be
separated
from
it
was
divided
into
districts
or
kingdoms
under
different
fairy
kings
and
queens
just
as
the
upper
world
of
mortals
we
already
know
how
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
after
their
defeat
by
the
sons
of
mil
at
the
battle
of
tailte
retired
to
this
underground
world
and
took
possession
of
its
palaces
beneath
the
green
hills
and
vales
of
ireland
and
how
from
there
as
gods
of
the
harvest
they
still
continued
to
exercise
authority
over
their
conquerors
or
marshalled
their
own
invisible
in
fairy
warfare
and
sometimes
interfered
in
the
wars
of
men
more
frequently
in
the
old
irish
manuscripts
the
celtic
otherworld
was
located
in
the
midst
of
the
western
ocean
as
though
it
were
the
of
the
lost
atlantis
and
manannan
mac
lir
the
son
of
the
sea
perhaps
himself
the
of
an
ancient
atlantean
king
was
one
of
the
divine
rulers
of
its
fairy
inhabitants
and
his
palace
for
he
was
one
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
was
there
rather
than
in
ireland
and
when
he
travelled
between
the
two
countries
it
was
in
a
magic
chariot
drawn
by
horses
who
moved
over
the
as
on
land
and
fairy
women
came
from

to

away
such
mortal
men
as
in
their
love
they
chose
or
else
to
take
great
arthur
wounded
unto
death
and
in
that
island
world
there
was
neither
death
nor
pain
nor
scandal
nought
save
immortal
and
unfading
youth
and
endless
joy
and
feasting
even
yet
at
rare
intervals
like
a
phantom
hy
brasil
appears
far
out
on
the
atlantic
no
later
than
the
summer
of
it
is
said
to
have
been
seen
from
west
ireland
just
as
that
strange
invisible
island
near
innishmurray
inhabited
by
the
invisible
is
seen
once
in
seven
years
and
too
many
men
of
intelligence
testify
to
having
seen
hy
brasil
at
the
same
moment
when
they
have
been
together
or
separated
as
during
the
summer
of
for
it
to
be
explained
away
as
an
ordinary
illusion
of
the
senses
nor
can
it
be
due
to
a
mirage
such
as
we
know
because
neither
its
shape
nor
position
seems
to
conform
to
any
known
island
or
land
mass
the
celtic
otherworld
is
like
that
hidden
realm
of
subjectivity
lying
just
beyond
the
horizon
of
mortal
existence
which
we
can
not
behold
when
we
would
save
with
the
mystic
vision
of
the
irish
seer
thus
in
the
legend
of
bran
friends
who
sat
over
dinner
at
harlech
with
the
head
of
bran
for
seven
years
three
curious
birds
acted
as
musicians
the
three
birds
of
rhiannon
which
were
said
to
sing
the
dead
back
to
life
and
the
living
into
death
but
the
birds
were
not
in
harlech
they
were
out
over
the
sea
in
the
atmosphere
of
realm
in
the
bosom
of
cardigan
bay
and
though
we
might
say
of
that
otherworld
as
we
learn
from
these
three
birds
of
rhiannon
and
as
socrates
would
say
that
its
inhabitants
are
come
from
the
living
and
the
living
in
our
world
from
the
dead
there
yet
as
has
already
been
set
forth
in
chapter
iv
we
ought
not
to
think
of
the
nor
of
such
great
heroes
and
gods
as
arthur
and
cuchulainn
and
finn
who
are
also
of
its
invisible
company
as
in
any
sense
shades
for
they
are
always
represented
as
being
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
an
existence
and
consciousness
greater
than
our
own
in
irish

great
plain
and
also
plain
agreeable

but
this
western
otherworld
if
it
is
what
we
believe
it
to
be
a
poetical
picture
of
the
great
subjective
world
can
not
be
the
realm
of
any
one
race
of
invisible
beings
to
the
exclusion
of
another
in
it
all
alike
gods
tuatha
de

fairies
demons
shades
and
every
sort
of
disembodied
spirits
find
their
appropriate
abode
for
though
it
seems
to
surround
and
interpenetrate
this
planet
even
as
the
interpenetrate
matter
it
can
have
no
other
limits
than
those
of
the
universe
itself
and
that
it
is
not
an
exclusive
realm
is
certain
from
what
our
old
irish
manuscripts
record
concerning
the
fomorian
races
these
when
they
met
defeat
on
the
of
moytura
at
the
hands
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
retired
altogether
from
ireland
their
overthrow
being
final
and
returned
to
their
own
invisible
country
a
mysterious
land
beyond
the
ocean
where
the
dead
find
a
new
existence
and
where
their
tethra
ruled
as
he
formerly
ruled
in
this
world
and
the
fairy
women
of
tethra
kingdom
even
like
those
who
came
from
the
tuatha
de
danann
of
erin
or
those
of
enticed
mortals
to
go
with
them
to
be
heroes
under
their
king
and
to
behold
there
the
assemblies
of
ancestors
it
was
one
of
them
who
came
to
connla
son
of
conn
supreme
king
of
ireland
and
this
was
her
message
to
him
immortals
invite
you
you
are
going
to
be
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
people
of
tethra
you
will
always
be
seen
there
in
the
assemblies
of
your
ancestors
in
the
midst
of
those
who
know
and
love
you
and
with
the
fairy
spell
upon
him
the
young
prince
entered
the
glass
boat
of
the
fairy
woman
and
his
father
the
king
in
great
tribulation
and
wonder
beheld
them
disappear
across
the
waters
never
to
return
the
silver
branch
and
the
golden
bough
to
enter
the
otherworld
before
the
appointed
hour
marked
by
death
a
passport
was
often
necessary
and
this
was
usually
a
silver
branch
of
the
sacred
bearing
blossoms
or
fruit
which
the
queen
of
the
land
of
the
and
gives
to
those
mortals
whom
she
wishes
for
as
companions
though
sometimes
as
we
shall
see
it
was
a
single
apple
without
its
branch
the
queen
gifts
serve
not
only
as
passports
but
also
as
food
and
drink
for
mortals
who
go
with
her
often
the
produces
music
so
soothing
that
mortals
who
hear
it
forget
all
troubles
and
even
cease
to
grieve
for
those
whom
the
fairy
women
for
us
there
are
no
episodes
more
important
than
those
in
the
ancient
epics
concerning
these
talismans
because
in
them
we
find
a
certain
key
which
unlocks
the
secret
of
that
world
from
which
such
talismans
are
brought
and
proves
it
to
be
the
same
sort
of
a
place
as
the
otherworld
of
the
greeks
and
romans
let
us
then
use
the
key
and
make
a
few
comparisons
between
the
silver
branch
of
the
celts
and
the
golden
bough
of
the
ancients
expecting
the
two
symbols
naturally
to
differ
in
their
functions
though
not
fundamentally
it
is
evident
at
the
outset
that
the
golden
bough
was
as
much
the
property
of
the
queen
of
that
underworld
called
hades
as
the
silver
branch
was
the
gift
of
the
celtic
fairy
queen
and
like
the
silver
bough
it
seems
to
have
been
the
symbolic
bond
between
that
world
and
this
offered
as
a
tribute
to
proserpine
by
all
initiates
who
made
the
mystic
voyage
in
full
human
consciousness
and
as
we
suspect
there
may
be
even
in
the
ancient
celtic
legends
of
mortals
who
make
that
strange
voyage
to
the
western
otherworld
and
return
to
this
world
again
an
echo
of
initiatory
rites
perhaps
druidic
similar
to
those
of
proserpine
as
shown
in
the
journey
of
aeneas
which
as
virgil
records
it
is
undoubtedly
a
poetical
rendering
of
an
actual
psychic
experience
of
a
great
initiate
in
virgil
classic
poem
the
sibyl
commanded
the
plucking
of
the
sacred
bough
to
be
carried
by
aeneas
when
he
entered
the
underworld
for
without
such
a
bough
plucked
near
the
entrance
to
avernus
from
the
wondrous
tree
sacred
to
infernal
juno
proserpine
none
could
enter
pluto
realm
and
when
charon
refused
to
ferry
aeneas
across
the
stygian
lake
until
the
drew
forth
the
golden
bough
from
her
bosom
where
she
had
hidden
it
it
becomes
clearly
enough
a
passport
to
hades
just
as
the
silver
branch
borne
by
the
fairy
woman
is
a
passport
to
and
the
who
guided
aeneas
to
the
greek
and
roman
otherworld
takes
the
place
of
the
fairy
woman
who
leads
mortals
like
bran
to
the
celtic
otherworld
the
otherworld
idea
literally
interpreted
with
this
parallel
between
the
otherworld
of
the
celts
and
that
of
the
ancients
seemingly
established
we
may
leave
poetical
images
and
seek
a
literal
interpretation
for
the
animistic
idea
about
those
realms
the
rites
of
proserpine
as
conducted
in
the
mysteries
of
antiquity
furnish
us
with
the
means
and
in
what
servius
has
written
we
have
the
material
ready
taking
the
letter
y
which
pythagoras
said
is
like
life
with
its
dividing
ways
of
good
and
evil
as
the
mystic
symbol
of
the
branch
which
all
initiates
like
aeneas
offered
to
proserpine
in
the
subjective
world
while
there
out
of
the
physical
body
he
says
of
the
initiatory
rites
the
poet
could
not
join
the
rites
of
proserpine
without
having
the
branch
to
hold
up
and
by
to
the
the
poet
celebrating
the
rites
of
this
passage
is
certainly
capable
of
but
one
meaning
and
we
may
perhaps
assume
that
the
invisible
realm
of
the
ancients
which
is
called
hades
is
like
the
celtic
otherworld
located
in
the
western
ocean
and
is
also
like
or
has
its
mythological
counterpart
in
the
elysian
fields
to
the
west
reserved
by
the
greeks
and
romans
for
their
gods
and
heroes
and
in
the
happy
otherworld
of
scandinavian
iranian
and
indian
mythologies
it
must
then
follow
that
all
these
realms
though
placed
in
different
localities
by
various
nations
epochs
traditions
scribes
and
poets
even
as
the
world
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
in
ireland
differs
from
that
ruled
over
by
one
of
their
own
race
manannan
the
son
of
the
sea
are
simply
various
ways
which
different
aryan
peoples
have
had
of
looking
at
that
one
great
invisible
realm
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
and
which
forms
the
heavenworld
of
every
religion
aryan
and
known
to
man
and
if
this
conclusion
is
accepted
and
it
seems
that
it
must
be
merely
on
the
evidence
of
the
literary
or
recorded
celtic
our
psychological
theory
stands
proven
the
rites
of
proserpine
had
many
counterparts
thus
to
pass
on
to
another
parallel
in
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
the
disappearance
of
the
maiden
into
the
into
hades
the
land
of
the
dead
was
continually
in
a
sacred
drama
and
it
no
doubt
was
one
of
the
principal
rites
attending
initiation
in
our
study
of
the
celtic
doctrine
of
we
shall
return
to
this
subject
of
celtic
initiation
the
voyage
of
bran
son
of
febal
we
are
well
prepared
now
to
enjoy
the
best
known
voyages
which
men
heroes
and
are
said
to
have
made
to
avalon
or
the
land
of
the
living
through
the
invitation
of
a
fairy
woman
or
else
of
the
god
manannan
himself
and
probably
the
most
famous
is
that
of
the
of
bran
son
of
as
so
admirably
translated
from
the
original
old
irish
saga
by
kuno
meyer
perhaps
in
all
celtic
literature
no
poem
surpasses
this
in
natural
and
simple
beauty
one
day
bran
heard
strange
music
behind
him
as
he
was
alone
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
stronghold
and
as
he
listened
so
sweet
was
the
sound
that
it
lulled
him
to
sleep
when
he
awoke
there
lay
beside
him
a
branch
of
silver
so
white
with
blossoms
that
it
was
not
easy
to
distinguish
the
blossoms
from
the
branch
bran
took
up
the
branch
and
carried
it
to
the
royal
house
and
when
the
hosts
were
assembled
therein
they
saw
a
woman
in
strange
raiment
standing
on
the
floor
whence
she
came
and
how
no
one
could
tell
and
as
they
all
beheld
her
she
sang
fifty
quatrains
to
bran
a
branch
of
the
from
emain
i
bring
like
those
one
knows
twigs
of
white
silver
are
on
it
crystal
brows
with
blossoms
there
is
a
distant
isle
around
which
glisten
a
fair
course
against
the
surge
four
feet
uphold
it
when
the
song
was
finished
woman
went
from
them
while
they
knew
not
whither
she
went
and
she
took
her
branch
with
her
the
branch
sprang
from
bran
hand
into
the
hand
of
the
woman
nor
was
there
strength
in
bran
hand
to
hold
the
branch
the
next
day
with
the
fairy
spell
upon
him
bran
begins
the
voyage
towards
the
setting
sun
on
the
ocean
he
meets
manannan
riding
in
his
magic
chariot
over
the
and
the
king
tells
bran
that
he
is
returning
to
ireland
after
long
ages
parting
from
the
son
of
the
sea
bran
goes
on
and
the
first
island
he
and
his
companions
reach
is
the
of
joy
where
one
of
the
party
is
set
ashore
the
second
isle
is
the
of
women
where
the
queen
draws
bran
and
his
followers
to
her
realm
with
a
magic
clew
and
then
entertains
them
for
what
seems
no
more
than
a
year
though
chanced
to
be
many
years
after
a
while
seizes
the
adventurers
and
they
come
to
a
unanimous
decision
to
return
to
ireland
but
they
depart
under
a
taboo
not
to
set
foot
on
earth
or
at
least
not
till
holy
water
has
been
sprinkled
on
them
in
their
coracle
they
arrive
before
a
gathering
at
srub
brain
probably
in
west
kerry
and
bran
who
may
now
possibly
be
regarded
as
an
apparition
temporarily
returned
from
the
otherworld
to
bid
his
people
farewell
announces
himself
and
this
reply
is
made
to
him
do
not
know
such
a
one
though
the
voyage
of
bran
is
in
our
ancient
stories
then
one
of
bran
party
in
his
eagerness
to
land
broke
the
taboo
he
from
them
out
of
the
coracle
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
earth
of
ireland
forthwith
he
was
a
heap
of
ashes
as
though
he
had
been
in
the
earth
for
many
hundred
years
thereupon
to
the
people
of
the
gathering
bran
told
all
his
wanderings
from
the
beginning
until
that
time
and
he
wrote
these
quatrains
in
ogam
and
then
bade
them
farewell
and
from
that
hour
his
wanderings
are
not
known
cormac
adventure
in
the
land
of
promise
in
adventure
in
the
land
of
there
is
again
a
magic
silver
branch
with
three
golden
apples
on
it
day
at
dawn
in
cormac
grandson
of
conn
was
alone
on
múr
tea
in
tara
he
saw
coming
towards
him
a
sedate
warrior
a
branch
of
silver
with
three
golden
apples
on
his
shoulder
delight
and
amusement
to
the
full
was
it
to
listen
to
the
music
of
that
branch
for
men
sore
wounded
or
women
in
or
folk
in
sickness
would
fall
asleep
at
the
melody
when
that
branch
was
shaken
and
the
warrior
tells
cormac
that
he
has
come
from
a
land
where
only
truth
is
known
where
there
is
age
nor
decay
nor
gloom
nor
sadness
nor
envy
nor
jealousy
nor
hatred
nor
haughtiness
on
his
promising
the
unknown
warrior
any
three
boons
that
he
shall
ask
cormac
is
given
the
magic
branch
the
warrior
disappears
suddenly
cormac
knew
not
whither
he
had
gone
turned
into
the
palace
the
household
marvelled
at
the
branch
cormac
shook
it
at
them
and
cast
them
into
slumber
from
that
hour
to
the
same
time
on
the
following
day
at
the
end
of
a
year
the
warrior
comes
into
his
meeting
and
asked
of
cormac
the
consideration
for
his
branch
it
shall
be
given
says
cormac
i
will
take
thy
daughter
ailbe
says
the
warrior
so
he
took
the
girl
with
him
the
women
of
tara
utter
three
loud
cries
after
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
erin
but
cormac
shook
the
branch
at
them
so
that
he
banished
grief
from
them
all
and
cast
them
into
sleep
that
day
month
comes
the
warrior
and
takes
with
him
carpre
lifechair
the
son
of
cormac
weeping
and
sorrow
ceased
not
in
tara
after
the
boy
and
on
that
night
no
one
therein
ate
or
slept
and
they
were
in
grief
and
in
exceeding
gloom
but
cormac
shook
the
branch
at
them
and
they
parted
from
their
sorrow
the
same
warrior
comes
again
what
askest
thou
says
cormac
thy
wife
saith
he
even
ethne
the
longsided
daughter
of
dunlang
king
of
leinster
then
he
takes
away
the
woman
with
him
thereupon
cormac
follows
the
messenger
and
all
his
people
go
with
him
but
great
mist
was
brought
upon
them
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
of
the
wall
cormac
found
himself
on
a
great
plain
alone
it
is
the
of
promise
palaces
of
bronze
and
houses
of
white
silver
thatched
with
white
wings
are
there
he
sees
in
the
garth
a
shining
fountain
with
five
streams
flowing
out
of
it
and
the
hosts
in
turn
its
water
nine
hazels
of
buan
grow
over
the
well
the
purple
hazels
drop
their
nuts
into
the
fountain
and
the
five
salmon
which
are
in
the
fountain
sever
them
and
send
their
husks
floating
down
the
streams
now
the
sound
of
the
falling
of
those
streams
is
more
melodious
than
any
music
that
men
sing
cormac
having
entered
the
fairy
palace
at
the
fountain
beholds
loveliest
of
the
world
women
after
she
has
been
magically
bathed
he
bathes
and
this
apparently
is
symbolical
of
his
purification
in
the
otherworld
finally
at
a
feast
the
sings
cormac
to
sleep
and
when
cormac
awakes
he
sees
beside
him
his
wife
and
children
who
had
preceded
him
thither
to
the
land
of
promise
the
who
them
all
is
none
other
than
the
great
god
manannan
mac
lir
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
there
in
the
otherworld
cormac
gains
a
magic
cup
of
gold
richly
and
wondrously
wrought
which
would
break
into
three
pieces
if
words
of
falsehood
be
spoken
under
it
and
the
magic
silver
branch
and
manannan
as
the
says
to
ireland
high
king
thy
family
then
and
take
the
cup
that
thou
mayest
have
it
for
discerning
between
truth
and
falsehood
and
thou
shalt
have
the
branch
for
music
and
delight
and
on
the
day
that
thou
shalt
die
they
all
will
be
taken
from
thee
i
am
manannan
son
of
ler
king
of
the
land
of
promise
to
see
the
land
of
promise
was
the
reason
i
brought
thee
hither
the
fountain
which
thou
sawest
with
the
five
streams
out
of
it
is
the
fountain
of
knowledge
and
the
streams
are
the
five
senses
through
which
knowledge
is
obtained
and
no
one
will
have
knowledge
who
drinketh
not
a
draught
out
of
the
fountain
itself
and
out
of
the
streams
the
folk
of
many
arts
are
those
who
drink
of
them
both
on
the
morrow
morning
when
cormac
arose
he
found
himself
on
the
green
of
tara
with
his
wife
and
his
son
and
daughter
and
having
his
branch
and
his
cup
now
that
was
afterwards
called
cormac
cup
and
it
used
to
distinguish
between
truth
and
falsehood
with
the
gael
howbeit
as
had
been
promised
him
by
manannan
it
remained
not
after
cormac
death
this
beautiful
tale
evidently
echoes
in
an
extremely
poetical
and
symbolical
manner
a
very
ancient
celtic
initiation
of
a
king
and
his
family
into
the
mystic
cult
of
the
mighty
god
manannan
son
of
the
sea
they
enter
the
otherworld
in
a
trance
state
and
on
waking
are
in
erin
again
spiritually
enriched
the
cup
of
truth
is
probably
the
symbol
of
having
gained
knowledge
of
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
and
the
branch
that
of
the
peace
and
joy
which
comes
to
all
who
are
truly
initiated
for
to
have
passed
from
the
realm
of
mortal
existence
to
the
realm
of
the
dead
of
the
of
the
gods
and
back
again
with
full
human
consciousness
all
the
while
was
equivalent
to
having
gained
the
philosopher
stone
the
elixir
of
life
the
cup
of
truth
and
to
having
bathed
in
the
fountain
of
eternal
youth
which
confers
triumph
over
death
and
unending
happiness
thus
we
may
have
here
a
celtic
poetical
parallel
to
the
initiatory
journey
of
aeneas
to
the
land
of
the
dead
or
hades
the
magic
wand
of
gods
fairies
and
druids
manannan
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
as
a
from
the
invisible
realm
bearing
the
of
silver
is
in
externals
though
not
in
other
ways
like
hermes
the
from
the
realm
of
the
gods
bearing
his
wand
of
two
intertwined
serpents
in
modern
this
divine
branch
or
wand
is
the
magic
wand
of
fairies
or
where
messengers
like
old
men
guide
mortals
to
an
underworld
it
is
a
staff
or
cane
with
which
they
strike
the
rock
hiding
the
secret
entrance
the
irish
druids
made
their
wands
of
divination
from
the
and
like
the
ancient
priests
of
egypt
greece
and
rome
are
believed
to
have
controlled
spirits
fairies
daemons
elementals
and
ghosts
while
making
such
divinations
it
will
help
us
to
understand
how
closely
the
ancient
symbols
have
affected
our
own
life
and
age
though
we
have
forgotten
their
relation
with
the
otherworld
by
offering
a
few
examples
beginning
with
the
ancient
irish
bards
who
were
associated
with
the
druids
a
wand
in
the
form
of
a
symbolic
branch
like
a
little
spike
or
crescent
with
gently
tinkling
bells
upon
it
was
borne
by
them
and
in
the
piece
called
or
of
the
ultonians
it
is
said
of
the
chief
bard
of
ulster
sencha
that
in
the
midst
of
a
bloody
fray
he
the
peaceful
branch
of
sencha
and
all
the
men
of
ulster
were
silent
quiet
in
an
dá
or
the
of
the
two
sages
the
mystic
symbol
used
by
gods
fairies
magicians
and
by
all
initiates
who
know
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
is
thus
described
as
a
druid
symbol
a
young
bard
who
aspired
to
succeed
his
father
as
chief
poet
of
ulster
his
journey
with
a
silver
branch
over
him
the
or
poets
of
the
second
order
carried
a
silver
branch
but
the
or
chief
poets
carried
a
branch
of
gold
all
other
poets
bore
a
branch
of
bronze
modern
and
ancient
parallels
are
among
the
most
civilized
as
among
the
least
civilized
peoples
and
in
civil
or
religious
life
among
ourselves
thus
it
was
with
a
magic
rod
that
moses
struck
the
rock
and
pure
water
gushed
forth
and
he
raised
the
same
rod
and
the
red
sea
opened
kings
hold
their
sceptres
no
less
than
neptune
his
trident
popes
and
bishops
have
their
croziers
in
the
roman
church
there
are
little
objects
used
to
perform
benedictions
high
civil
officials
have
their
mace
of
office
and
all
the
world
over
there
are
the
wands
of
magicians
and
of
the
of
cuchulainn
we
turn
now
to
the
story
of
the
of
and
this
is
how
the
great
hero
of
ulster
was
manannan
mac
lir
tiring
of
his
wife
fand
had
deserted
her
and
so
she
wishing
to
marry
cuchulainn
went
to
ireland
with
her
sister
liban
taking
the
form
of
two
birds
bound
together
by
a
chain
of
red
gold
fand
and
liban
rested
on
a
lake
in
ulster
where
cuchulainn
should
see
them
as
he
was
hunting
to
capture
the
two
birds
cuchulainn
cast
a
javelin
at
them
but
they
escaped
though
injured
disappointed
at
a
failure
like
this
which
for
him
was
most
unusual
cuchulainn
went
away
to
a
menhir
where
he
sat
down
and
fell
asleep
then
he
saw
two
women
one
in
a
green
and
one
in
a
crimson
cloak
and
the
woman
in
green
coming
up
to
him
laughed
and
struck
him
with
a
object
the
woman
in
crimson
did
likewise
and
alternately
the
two
women
kept
striking
him
till
they
left
him
almost
dead
and
straightway
the
mighty
hero
of
the
red
branch
knights
took
to
his
bed
with
a
strange
malady
which
no
druid
or
doctor
in
all
ireland
could
cure
till
the
end
of
a
year
cuchulainn
lay
on
his
at
without
speaking
to
any
one
then
the
day
before
november
eve
there
came
to
him
an
unknown
messenger
who
sang
to
him
a
wonderful
song
promising
to
cure
him
of
his
malady
if
he
would
only
accept
the
invitation
of
the
daughters
of
aed
abrat
to
visit
them
in
the
otherworld
when
the
song
was
ended
the
messenger
departed
they
knew
not
whence
he
came
nor
whither
he
went
thereupon
cuchulainn
went
to
the
place
where
the
malady
had
been
put
on
him
and
there
appeared
to
him
again
the
woman
in
the
green
cloak
she
let
it
be
known
to
cuchulainn
that
she
was
liban
and
that
she
was
longing
for
him
to
go
with
her
to
the
plain
of
delight
to
fight
against
labraid
enemies
and
she
promised
cuchulainn
as
a
reward
that
he
would
get
fand
to
wife
but
cuchulainn
would
not
accept
the
invitation
without
knowing
to
what
country
he
was
called
so
he
sent
his
charioteer
laeg
to
bring
back
from
there
a
report
laeg
went
with
the
fairy
woman
in
a
boat
of
bronze
and
returned
and
when
cuchulainn
heard
from
him
the
wonderful
glories
of
that
otherworld
of
the
he
willingly
set
out
for
it
after
cuchulainn
had
overthrown
labraid
enemies
and
had
been
in
the
otherworld
a
month
with
the
fairy
woman
fand
he
returned
to
ireland
alone
though
afterwards
in
a
place
agreed
upon
fand
joined
him
emer
the
wife
of
cuchulainn
was
overcome
with
jealousy
and
schemed
to
kill
fand
so
that
fand
returned
to
her
husband
the
god
manannan
and
he
received
her
back
again
when
she
was
gone
cuchulainn
could
not
be
consoled
but
emer
obtained
from
the
druids
a
magic
drink
for
cuchulainn
which
made
him
forget
all
about
the
otherworld
and
the
fairy
woman
fand
and
another
drink
the
druids
gave
to
emer
so
that
she
forgot
all
her
jealousy
and
then
manannan
mac
lir
himself
came
and
shook
his
mantle
between
cuchulainn
and
fand
to
prevent
the
two
ever
meeting
again
and
thus
it
was
that
the
failed
to
steal
away
the
great
cuchulainn
the
magic
of
the
druids
and
the
power
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
king
triumphed
and
the
champion
of
ulster
did
not
go
to
the
otherworld
until
he
met
a
natural
death
in
that
last
great
fight
ossian
return
from
fairyland
ossian
too
like
cuchulainn
was
enticed
into
fairyland
by
a
fairy
woman
she
carries
him
away
on
a
white
horse
across
the
western
ocean
and
as
they
are
moving
over
the
they
behold
a
fair
maid
on
a
brown
horse
and
she
holding
in
her
right
hand
a
golden
apple
after
the
hero
had
married
his
fairy
abductress
and
lived
in
the
otherworld
for
three
hundred
years
an
overpowering
desire
to
return
to
ireland
and
join
again
in
the
councils
of
his
dearly
beloved
fenian
brotherhood
took
possession
of
him
and
he
set
out
on
the
same
white
horse
on
which
he
travelled
thence
with
the
fairy
princess
for
such
was
his
wife
and
she
as
he
went
thrice
warned
him
not
to
lay
his
on
level
ground
and
he
heard
from
her
the
startling
announcement
that
the
fenians
were
all
gone
and
ireland
quite
changed
safe
in
ireland
ossian
seeks
the
brotherhood
and
though
he
goes
from
one
place
to
another
where
his
old
companions
were
wont
to
meet
not
one
of
them
can
he
find
and
how
changed
is
all
the
land
he
realizes
at
last
how
long
he
must
have
been
away
the
words
of
his
fairy
wife
are
too
sadly
true
while
ossian
wanders
disconsolately
over
ireland
he
comes
to
a
multitude
of
men
trying
to
move
an
enormous
slab
of
marble
under
which
some
other
men
are
lying
assistance
is
asked
and
he
generously
gives
it
but
in
leaning
over
his
horse
to
take
up
the
stone
with
one
hand
the
girth
breaks
and
he
falls
straightway
the
white
horse
fled
away
on
his
way
home
and
ossian
became
aged
decrepit
and
blind
the
going
of
lanval
to
avalon
the
fairy
romances
which
were
recorded
during
the
mediaeval
period
in
continental
europe
report
a
surprisingly
large
number
of
heroes
who
like
cuchulainn
and
ossian
fell
under
the
power
of
fairy
women
or
and
followed
one
of
them
to
the
or
avalon
besides
arthur
they
include
sir
lancelot
sir
gawayne
ogier
guingemor
and
lanval
see
pp
the
story
of
lanval
is
told
by
marie
de
france
in
one
of
her
and
is
so
famous
a
one
that
we
shall
briefly
outline
it
lanval
was
a
mediaeval
knight
who
lived
during
the
time
of
king
arthur
in
brittany
he
was
young
and
very
beautiful
so
that
one
of
the
fairy
damsels
fell
in
love
with
him
and
in
the
true
irish
fashion
himself
and
his
fairy
sweetheart
mounted
on
the
same
fairy
horse
the
two
went
riding
off
to
fairyland
on
the
horse
behind
her
with
full
rush
lanval
jumped
with
her
he
goes
away
into
avalon
according
to
what
the
briton
tells
us
into
an
isle
which
is
very
beautiful
the
voyage
of
teigue
son
of
cian
there
is
another
type
of
in
which
through
adventure
rather
than
through
invitation
from
one
of
the
fairy
beings
men
enter
the
otherworld
as
illustrated
by
the
of
and
by
the
still
more
beautiful
of
teigue
son
of
this
last
old
irish
story
summarizes
many
of
the
otherworld
elements
we
have
so
far
considered
and
though
it
shows
christian
influences
gives
us
a
very
clear
picture
of
the
land
of
youth
amid
the
western
ocean
a
land
such
as
ponce
de
leon
and
so
many
brave
navigators
sought
in
america
teigue
son
of
cian
and
heir
to
the
kingship
of
west
munster
with
his
followers
set
out
from
ireland
to
recover
his
wife
and
brethren
who
had
been
stolen
by
cathmann
and
his
band
of
from
fresen
a
land
near
spain
it
was
the
time
of
the
spring
tide
when
the
sea
was
rough
and
storms
coming
on
the
voyagers
they
lost
their
way
after
about
nine
weeks
they
came
to
a
land
fairer
than
any
land
they
had
ever
beheld
it
was
the
happy
otherworld
in
it
were
many
with
leafy
oaks
too
in
it
and
hazels
yellow
with
nuts
in
their
clusters
and
wide
smooth
plain
clad
in
flowering
clover
all
bedewed
with
honey
in
the
midst
of
this
plain
teigue
and
his
companions
descried
three
hills
and
on
each
of
them
an
impregnable
place
of
strength
at
the
first
stronghold
which
had
a
rampart
of
white
marble
teigue
was
welcomed
by
lady
fairest
of
the
whole
world
women
and
she
told
him
that
the
stronghold
is
the
abode
ireland
kings
from
heremon
son
of
milesius
to
conn
of
the
hundred
battles
who
was
the
last
to
pass
into
it
teigue
with
his
people
moved
on
till
they
gained
the
middle
the
with
a
rampart
of
gold
there
also
found
a
queen
of
gracious
form
and
she
draped
in
vesture
of
a
golden
fabric
who
tells
them
that
they
are
in
the
earth
fourth
paradise
at
the
third
the
with
a
silver
rampart
teigue
and
his
party
met
connla
the
son
of
conn
of
the
hundred
battles
his
hand
he
held
a
fragrant
apple
having
the
hue
of
gold
a
third
part
of
it
he
would
eat
and
still
for
all
he
consumed
never
a
whit
would
it
be
diminished
and
at
his
side
sat
a
young
woman
of
many
charms
who
spake
thus
to
teigue
had
bestowed
on
him
felt
for
him
true
affection
love
and
therefore
wrought
to
have
him
come
to
me
in
this
land
where
our
delight
both
of
us
is
to
continue
in
looking
at
and
in
perpetual
contemplation
of
one
another
above
and
beyond
which
we
pass
not
to
commit
impurity
or
fleshly
sin
whatsoever
both
connla
and
his
friend
were
clad
in
vestments
of
green
like
the
and
their
step
was
so
light
that
hardly
did
the
beautiful
bend
beneath
it
and
the
apple
was
that
supported
the
pair
of
them
and
when
once
they
had
partaken
of
it
nor
age
nor
dimness
could
affect
them
when
teigue
asked
who
occupied
the
with
the
silver
rampart
the
maiden
with
connla
made
this
reply
that
one
there
is
not
any
one
for
behoof
of
the
righteous
kings
that
after
acceptance
of
the
faith
shall
rule
ireland
it
is
that
yonder
stands
ready
and
we
are
they
who
until
such
those
virtuous
princes
shall
enter
into
it
keep
the
same
in
the
which
teigue
my
soul
thou
too
shalt
have
an
appointed
place
across
the
most
capacious
palace
teigue
looked
away
as
he
was
observing
the
beauty
of
the
yet
uninhabited
marked
a
thickly
furnished
that
bare
blossoms
and
ripe
fruit
both
what
is
that
beyond
he
asked
of
the
maiden
and
she
made
answer
that
fruit
it
is
that
for
meat
shall
serve
the
congregation
which
is
to
be
in
this
mansion
a
single
apple
of
the
same
it
was
that
brought
coaxed
away
connla
to
then
the
party
rested
and
there
came
towards
them
a
whole
array
of
feminine
beauty
among
which
was
a
lovely
damsel
of
refined
form
who
foretold
to
teigue
the
manner
and
time
of
his
death
and
as
a
token
she
gave
him
fair
cup
of
emerald
hue
in
which
are
inherent
many
virtues
for
among
other
things
though
it
were
but
water
poured
into
it
incontinently
it
would
be
wine
and
this
was
her
farewell
message
to
teigue
that
the
cup
let
not
thine
hand
part
but
have
it
for
a
token
when
it
shall
escape
from
thee
then
in
a
short
time
after
shalt
thou
die
and
where
thou
shalt
meet
thy
death
is
in
the
glen
that
is
on
boyne
side
there
the
earth
shall
grow
into
a
great
hill
and
the
name
that
it
shall
bear
will
be
there
too
when
thou
shalt
first
have
been
wounded
by
a
roving
wild
hart
after
which
allmarachs
will
slay
thee
i
will
bury
thy
body
but
thy
soul
shall
come
with
me
hither
where
till
the
judgement
day
thou
shalt
assume
a
body
light
and
ethereal
as
the
party
led
by
teigue
were
going
down
to
the
seashore
to
depart
the
girl
who
had
been
escorting
them
asked
long
they
had
been
in
the
country

estimation
they
replied

in
it
but
one
single
day
she
however
said
an
entire
twelvemonth
ye
are
in
it
during
which
time
ye
have
had
neither
meat
nor
drink
nor
how
long
soever
ye
should
be

cold
or
thirst
or
hunger
assail
you
and
when
teigue
and
his
party
had
entered
their
they
looked
astern

saw
not

they
came

obscuring
magic
veil

drawn
over
it
the

this
interesting
combines
in
a
way
the
type
of
tale
wherein
a
fairy
woman
comes
from
the
otherworld
to
our

in
this

world
beneath

in

than
amid

there
is
a
curious
poem
in
the
of

describing
an
expedition
led
by
cuchulainn
to
the
stronghold

suggests
why
so
few
who
invaded
that
hades
world
ever
returned
perhaps
why
mystically
speaking
so
few
men
could
escape
either
through
initiation
or
the
natural
confusion
and
forgetfulness
arising
out
of
death
in
the
of
a
weird
poem
or
the
of
annwn
describes
in
language
not
always
clear
how
the
brythonic
arthur
made
a
similar
journey
to
the
welsh
hades
world
named
annwn
where
he
like
cuchulainn
in
scáth
gained
possession
of
a
magic
cauldron
a
pagan
celtic
type
of
the
holy
grail
which
furnishes
inexhaustible
food
though
will
not
boil
the
food
of
a
coward
but
in
stanzas
iii
and
iv
of
annwn
or
uffern
as
it
is
otherwise
called
is
not
an
underground
realm
but
some
world
to
be
reached
like
the
gaelic
land
of
promise
by
sea
annwn
is
also
called
caer
sidi
which
in
another
poem
of
the
of
no
xiv
is
thought
of
as
an
island
of
immortal
youth
amid
streams
of
the
ocean
where
there
is
a
fountain
literary
evolution
of
the
happy
otherworld
idea
we
have
now
noticed
two
chief
classes
of
otherworld
legends
in
one
there
is
the
beautiful
and
peaceful
or
of
the
living
under
manannan
rule
across
the
seas
and
its
fairy
inhabitants
are
principally
women
who
lure
away
noble
men
and
youths
through
love
for
them
in
the
other
there
is
a
hades
world
often
confused
with
the
former
in
which
great
heroes
go
on
some
mysterious
quest
sometimes
this
hades
world
is
inseparable
from
the
underground
palaces
or
world
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
again
it
may
be
an
underlake
like
that
entered
by
laeghaire
and
his
fifty
companions
see
or
as
in
of
late
composition
it
is
an
land
wherein
dermot
has
adventures
and
in
a
similar
tale
murough
on
the
invitation
of
a
mysterious
stranger
who
comes
out
of
a
lake
and
then
disappears
the
mist
of
a
winter
fog
or
the
whiff
of
a
march
wind
dives
beneath
the
lake
waters
and
is
escorted
to
the
palace
of
king
wherein
he
sees
the
stranger
as
the
himself
sitting
on
a
golden
throne
cf
pp
in
continual
feasting
there
murough
passes
a
day
and
a
year
thinking
the
time
only
a
few
days
as
a
rule
the
hades
world
or
underground
and
world
is
unlike
manannan
peaceful
ocean
realm
being
often
described
as
a
place
of
much
strife
and
mortals
are
usually
induced
to
enter
it
to
aid
in
settling
the
troubles
of
its
fairy
inhabitants
all
the
numerous
variations
of
otherworld
tales
now
extant
in
celtic
literature
show
a
common
origin
though
almost
all
of
them
have
been
coloured
by
christian
ideas
about
heaven
hell
and
purgatory
from
the
earliest
tales
of
the
otherworld
type
like
those
of
bran
maelduin
and
connla
all
of
which
may
go
back
to
the
early
eighth
century
as
compositions
the
christianizing
influence
is
already
clearly
begun
and
in
the
of
snedgus
and
of
mac
of
the
late
ninth
century
this
influence
predominates
purely
christian
texts
of
about
the
same
period
or
later
describe
the
christian
heaven
as
though
it
were
the
pagan
otherworld
some
of
these
like
the
latin
version
of
the
tale
of
brandan
greatly
influenced
european
literature
and
probably
contributed
to
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
the
combination
of
christian
and
pagan
celtic
ideas
is
well
shown
in
the
of
the
húi
a
wondrous
island
was
shown
to
them
a
venerable
old
man
with
fair
builded
churches
and
beautiful
bright
altars
beautiful
green
grass
therein
a
dew
of
honey
on
its
grass
little
bees
and
fair
birds
music
therein
so
that
merely
to
listen
to
them
was
enough
of
delight
but
in
another
passage
the
christian
scribe
describes
otherworld
birds
as
souls
some
of
them
in
hell
of
the
land
of
erin
am
i
quoth
the
bird
and
i
am
the
soul
of
a
woman
and
i
am
a
monkess
unto
thee
she
saith
to
the
elder
come
ye
to
another
place
saith
the
bird
to
hearken
to
yon
birds
the
birds
that
ye
see
are
the
souls
that
come
on
sunday
out
of
hell
still
other
islands
are
definitely
made
into
christian
hells
full
of
fire
wherein
wailing
and
shrieking
men
are
being
mangled
by
the
beaks
and
talons
of
birds
but
sometimes
like
the
legends
about
the
tuatha
de
danann
the
legends
about
the
otherworld
were
taken
literally
and
most
seriously
by
some
early
saints
professor
loth
records
a
very
interesting
episode
how
malo
and
his
teacher
brandan
actually
set
out
on
an
ocean
voyage
to
find
the
of
the
pagan
celts
malo
when
a
youth
embarks
with
his
teacher
brandan
in
a
boat
in
search
of
that
mysterious
country
after
some
days
the
waves
drive
him
back
rebuffed
and
discouraged
upon
the
seashore
an
angel
opens
his
eyes
the
land
of
eternal
peace
and
of
eternal
youth
is
that
which
christianity
promises
to
its
elect
not
only
was
the
celtic
otherworld
gradually
changed
into
a
christian
heaven
or
hell
from
the
eighth
century
onward
but
its
divine
inhabitants
soon
came
to
suffer
the
rationalization
commonly
applied
to
their
race
and
the
transcribers
began
to
set
them
down
as
actual
personages
of
irish
history
as
we
have
already
observed
the
tuatha
de
danann
were
shorn
of
their
immortality
and
were
given
in
exchange
all
the
passions
and
shortcomings
of
men
and
made
subject
to
disease
and
death
this
perhaps
was
a
natural
anthropomorphic
process
such
as
is
met
with
in
all
mythologies
celtic
myth
and
mysticism
wherein
may
yet
be
read
the
deepest
secrets
of
life
and
death
supplied
names
and
legends
to
fill
out
a
christianized
scheme
of
irish
chronology
which
was
made
to
begin
some
six
thousand
years
ago
with
adam
a
few
of
the
pagan
legends
however
met
very
fair
treatment
at
the
hands
of
poetical
and
patriotic
christian
transcribers
thus
in
though
the
celtic
otherworld
has
become
land
of
the
saints
its
primal
character
is
clearly
discernible
to
reach
it
a
sea
voyage
is
necessary
and
it
is
a
land
where
there
is
no
pride
falsehood
envy
disease
or
death
is
delight
of
every
goodness
in
it
there
are
singing
birds
and
for
sustenance
while
there
the
voyagers
need
only
to
hear
its
music
and
themselves
with
the
odour
which
is
in
the
land
again
in
the
of
and
in
later
there
is
a
of
almost
primal
pagan
purity
it
alludes
to
that
of
tuag
inbir
to
tuag
daughter
of
conall
manannan
the
sent
a
messenger
a
druid
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
in
the
shape
of
a
woman
the
druid
chanted
a
sleep
spell
over
the
girl
and
while
he
left
her
on
the
seashore
to
look
for
a
boat
in
which
to
embark
for
the
of
everliving
women
a
wave
of
the
flood
tide
came
and
drowned
her
but
the
oxford
version
of
the
same
tale
doubts
whether
the
maiden
was
drowned
for
it
suggests
maybe
it
the
wave
was
manannan
himself
that
was
carrying
her
off
thus
the
scribe
understood
that
to
go
to
manannan
world
literally
meant
entering
a
sleep
or
trance
state
or
what
is
equivalent
in
the
case
of
the
maiden
whom
manannan
summoned
the
passage
through
death
from
the
physical
body
and
still
the
irish
peasant
believes
that
the
people
take
to
their
invisible
world
all
young
men
or
maidens
who
meet
death
or
that
one
under
a
fairy
spell
may
go
to
their
world
for
a
short
time
and
come
back
to
our
world
again
we
have
frequently
emphasized
how
truly
the
modern
celtic
peasant
in
certain
localities
has
kept
to
the
faith
of
his
pagan
ancestors
while
the
learned
christian
scribes
have
often
departed
widely
from
it
the
story
of
the
voyage
of
fionn
to
the
otherworld
which
campbell
found
living
among
scotch
peasants
as
late
as
the
last
century
adds
a
striking
proof
of
this
assertion
so
does
michael
comyn
peasant
version
of
ossian
in
the
of
youth
as
outlined
above
which
though
dating
from
about
has
all
the
natural
character
of
the
best
ancient
tales
like
those
about
bran
and
cormac
we
are
inclined
therefore
to
attach
a
value
even
higher
than
we
have
already
done
to
the
testimony
of
the
living
which
confirms
in
so
many
parallel
ways
as
has
been
shown
the
of
the
remote
past
yeats
the
irish
poet
adequately
sums
up
this
matter
by
saying
the
irish
peasant
believes
that
the
utmost
he
can
dream
was
once
or
still
is
a
reality
by
his
own
door
he
will
point
to
some
mountain
and
tell
you
that
some
famous
hero
or
beauty
lived
and
sorrowed
there
or
he
will
tell
you
that
the
country
of
the
young
the
old
celtic
paradise
the
land
of
the
living
heart
as
it
used
to
be
called
is
all
about
him
at
the
end
of
his
long
and
careful
study
of
the
celtic
otherworld
alfred
nutt
arrived
at
the
tentative
conclusion
which
coincides
with
our
own
that
vision
of
a
happy
otherworld
found
in
irish
mythic
romances
of
the
eighth
and
following
centuries
is
substantially
that
its
closest
analogues
are
in
hellenic
myth
and
that
with
these
forms

most
archaic

presentation
of
the
divine
and
happy
land

possess

as
if
ossian
was

premature

of

the

among

may
have
differed
from
that
among

it
was

carefully

said

historical
survey
of
the
doctrine
among
ourselves
the
doctrine
may
seem
a
strange
one
though
among
the
great
nations
of
antiquity
the
egyptians
indians
greeks
and
celts
it
was
taught
in
the
mysteries
and
and
formed
the
of
the
most
important
philosophical
systems
like
those
of
buddha
pythagoras
plato
the
and
the
druids
the
alexandrian
jews
also
were
familiar
with
the
doctrine
as
implied
in
the
of
viii
and
in
the
writings
of
philo
it
was
one
of
the
teachings
in
the
schools
of
alexandria
and
thus
directly
shaped
the
thoughts
of
some
of
the
early
church
fathers
for
example
tertullian
of
carthage
circa
and
origen
of
alexandria
circa
it
is
of
considerable
historical
importance
for
us
at
this
point
to
consider
at
some
length
if
christians
in
the
first
centuries
held
or
were
greatly
influenced
by
the
doctrine
because
as
we
shall
presently
observe
the
probable
influence
of
christian
on
pagan
celtic
beliefs
may
have
been
at
a
certain
period
very
deep
and
even
the
most
important
reshaping
influence
as
an
examination
of
origen
proves
origen
himself
believed
in
the
doctrine
but
the
theologians
who
created
the
greek
canons
of
the
fifth
council
disagreed
with
origen
views
and
condemned
origen
for
believing
among
other
things
called
by
them
heresies
that
jesus
christ
will
be
reincarnated
and
suffer
on
earth
a
second
time
to
save
the
daemons
an
order
of
spiritual
beings
regarded
by
some
ancient
philosophers
as
destined
to
evolve
into
human
souls
tertullian
contemporary
with
origen
in
his
considers
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
can
be
regarded
as
christian
in
view
of
the
declaration
by
jesus
christ
that
john
the
baptist
was
elias
or
elijah
the
old
jewish
prophet
come
again
if
ye
are
willing
to
receive
it
or
him
this
john
the
baptist
is
elijah
which
is
to
come
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
tertullian
concludes
and
modern
christian
theologians
frequently
echo
him
upon
comparing
malachi
iv
that
all
the
new
testament
writers
mean
to
convey
is
that
john
the
baptist
possessed
or
acted
in
spirit
and
power
of
elias
but
was
not
actually
a
reincarnation
of
elias
since
he
did
not
possess
soul
and
body
of
elias
had
tertullian
been
a
mystic
and
not
merely
a
theologian
with
a
personal
bias
against
the
mystery
teachings
which
bias
he
shows
throughout
his
it
is
quite
evident
that
he
would
have
been
on
this
doctrinal
matter
in
agreement
with
origen
who
was
both
a
mystic
and
a
theologian
and
then
probably
with
such
an
agreement
of
these
two
eminent
church
fathers
on
record
before
the
time
when
christian
councils
met
to
determine
canonical
and
orthodox
beliefs
the
doctrine
of
would
never
have
been
expurgated
from
christianity
in
the
an
ancient
work
which
contains
what
are
alleged
to
be
some
of
jesus
christ
esoteric
teachings
to
his
disciples
it
is
clearly
stated
contrary
to
tertullian
argument
but
in
accord
with
what
we
may
assume
view
would
have
been
that
john
the
baptist
was
the
reincarnation
of
elias
the
same
work
further
expounds
the
doctrine
of
as
a
teaching
of
jesus
christ
which
applies
not
to
particular
personages
only
like
elias
but
as
a
universal
law
governing
the
lives
of
all
mankind
as
our
discussion
has
made
evident
during
the
first
centuries
the
doctrine
was
undoubtedly
well
known
to
alexandrian
christians
among
other
early
christian
theologians
and
philosophers
who
held
some
form
of
a
doctrine
were
synesius
bishop
of
ptolemais
circa
boethius
a
roman
circa
and
psellus
a
native
of
andros
second
half
of
ninth
century
in
addition
to
the
many
sects
the
manichaeans
who
comprised
more
than
seventy
sects
connected
with
the
primitive
church
also
promulgated
the
doctrine
along
with
the
condemnation
of
the
gnostics
and
manichaeans
as
heretical
the
doctrine
of
was
likewise
condemned
by
various
ecclesiastical
bodies
and
councils
this
was
the
declaration
by
the
council
of
constantinople
in
shall
support
the
mythical
doctrine
of
the
of
the
soul
and
the
consequent
wonderful
opinion
of
its
return
let
him
be
anathema
and
so
after
centuries
of
controversy
the
ancient
doctrine
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
christian
it
is
very
likely
however
as
will
be
shown
in
due
order
that
a
few
of
the
early
celtic
missionaries
always
famous
for
their
celtic
independence
even
in
questions
touching
christian
theology
and
government
did
not
feel
themselves
bound
by
the
decisions
of
continental
church
councils
with
respect
to
this
particular
doctrine
during
the
mediaeval
period
in
europe
the
doctrine
continued
to
live
on
in
secret
among
many
of
the
alchemists
and
mystical
philosophers
and
among
such
druids
as
survived
religious
persecution
and
it
has
come
down
from
that
period
to
this
through
orders
like
the
rosicrucian
order
an
order
which
seems
to
have
had
an
unbroken
existence
from
the
middle
ages
or
earlier
and
likewise
through
the
unbroken
traditions
of
modern
druidism
in
our
own
times
there
is
what
may
be
called
a
renaissance
of
the
ancient
doctrine
in
europe
and
america
especially
in
england
germany
france
and
the
united
states
through
various
philosophical
or
religious
societies
some
of
them
founding
their
teachings
and
literature
on
the
ancient
and
mediaeval
mystical
philosophers
while
others
stand
as
the
representatives
in
the
west
of
the
mystical
schools
of
modern
india
which
like
modern
druidism
claim
to
have
existed
from
what
we
call
prehistoric
times
in
the
roman
church
eminent
theologians
have
called
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
the
christian
counterpart
of
the
philosophical
doctrine
of
and
the
real
significance
of
this
opinion
will
appear
in
our
later
study
of
patrick
purgatory
which
as
we
hold
is
connected
more
or
less
definitely
with
the
doctrines
of
the
underworld
of
the
and
spirits
as
well
as
shades
of
the
dead
and
with
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
scientifically
speaking
as
shown
in
the
welsh
triads
of
bardism
the
ancient
celtic
doctrine
of
represented
for
the
priestly
and
bardic
initiates
an
exposition
of
the
complete
cycle
of
human
evolution
that
is
to
say
it
included
what
we
now
call
darwinism
which
explains
only
the
purely
physical
evolution
of
the
body
which
man
inhabits
as
an
inheritance
from
the
brute
kingdom
and
also
besides
darwinism
a
comprehensive
theory
of
man
own
evolution
as
a
spiritual
being
both
apart
from
and
in
a
physical
body
on
his
road
to
the
perfection
which
comes
from
knowing
completely
the
of
existence
and
in
time
judging
from
the
rapid
advance
of
the
present
age
our
own
science
through
psychical
research
may
work
back
to
the
old
mystery
teachings
and
declare
them
scientific
see
chap
xii
according
to
the
barddas
mss
with
this
preliminary
survey
of
the
subject
we
may
now
proceed
to
show
how
in
the
celtic
scheme
of
evolution
the
otherworld
with
all
its
gods
fairies
and
invisible
beings
and
this
world
with
all
its
visible
beings
form
the
two
poles
of
life
or
conscious
existence
let
us
begin
with
purely
philosophical
conceptions
going
first
to
the
welsh
where
it
is
said
are
three
circles
of
existence
the
circle
of
ceugant
the
circle
of
infinity
where
there
is
neither
animate
nor
inanimate
save
god
and
god
only
can
traverse
it
the
circle
of
abred
the
circle
of
where
the
dead
is
stronger
than
the
living
and
where
every
principal
existence
is
derived
from
the
dead
and
man
has
traversed
it
and
the
circle
of
gwynvyd
the
circle
of
the
white
the
circle
of
perfection
where
the
living
is
stronger
than
the
dead
and
where
every
principal
existence
is
derived
from
the
living
and
life
that
is
from
god
and
man
shall
traverse
it
nor
will
man
attain
to
perfect
knowledge
until
he
shall
have
fully
traversed
the
circle
of
gwynvyd
for
no
absolute
knowledge
can
be
obtained
but
by
the
experience
of
the
senses
from
having
borne
and
suffered
every
condition
and
incident
three
stabilities
of
knowledge
to
have
traversed
every
state
of
life
to
remember
every
state
and
its
incidents
and
to
be
able
to
traverse
every
state
as
one
would
wish
for
the
sake
of
experience
and
judgement
and
this
will
be
obtained
in
the
circle
of
gwynvyd
thus
expounds
the
complete
bardic
scheme
of
evolution
as
one
in
which
the
monad
or
soul
as
a
knowledge
of
physical
existence
is
gradually
unfolded
to
it
passes
through
every
phase
of
material
embodiment
before
it
enters
the
human
kingdom
where
for
the
first
time
exercising
freewill
in
a
physical
body
it
becomes
responsible
for
all
its
acts
the
bardic
doctrine
as
otherwise
stated
is
the
soul
commenced
its
course
in
the
lowest
and
passed
at
death
to
other
bodies
of
a
superior
order
successively
and
in
regular
gradation
until
it
entered
that
of
man
humanity
is
a
state
of
liberty
where
man
can
attach
himself
to
either
good
or
evil
as
he
pleases
once
in
the
human
kingdom
the
soul
begins
a
second
period
of
growth
altogether
different
from
that
preceding
a
period
of
growth
toward
divinity
and
with
this
in
our
study
we
are
chiefly
concerned
it
seems
clear
that
the
circle
of
gwynvyd
finds
its
parallel
in
the
nirvana
of
buddhism
being
like
it
a
state
of
absolute
knowledge
and
felicity
in
which
man
becomes
a
divine
being
a
veritable
god
we
see
in
all
this
the
intimate
relation
which
there
was
thought
to
be
between
what
we
call
the
state
of
life
and
the
state
of
death
between
the
world
of
men
and
the
world
of
gods
fairies
demons
spirits
and
shades
our
next
step
must
be
to
show
first
what
some
other
authorities
have
had
to
say
about
this
relation
and
then
second
and
fundamentally
that
gods
or
like
the
or
tuatha
de
danann
could
come
to
this
world
not
only
as
we
have
been
seeing
them
come
as
fairy
women
fairy
men
and
gods
at
will
visible
or
invisible
to
mortals
but
also
through
submitting
to
human
birth
according
to
ancient
and
modern
authorities
first
therefore
for
opinions
and
we
may
go
to
the
ancients
and
then
to
the
moderns
here
are
a
few
from
julius
caesar
particular
they
the
druids
wish
to
inculcate
this
idea
that
souls
do
not
die
but
pass
from
one
body
to
another
gauls
declare
that
they
have
all
sprung
from
their
father
dis
or
pluto
and
this
they
say
was
delivered
to
them
by
the
druids
and
the
testimony
of
caesar
is
confirmed
by
diodorus
siculus
and
by
pomponius
mela
lucan
in
the
addressing
the
druids
on
their
doctrine
of
says
you
know
what
you
sing
death
is
the
centre
of
a
long
life
and
again
in
the
same
passage
he
observes
the
folk
upon
whom
the
bear
looks
down
happy
in
this
error
whom
of
fears
the
greatest
moves
not
the
dread
of
death
hence
their
warrior
heart
hurls
them
against
the
steel
hence
their
ready
welcome
of
death
and
the
thought
that
it
were
a
coward
part
to
grudge
a
life
sure
of
its
return
douglas
hyde
in
his
history
of
speaking
for
the
irish
people
says
of
the
doctrine
the
idea
of
which
forms
part
of
half
a
dozen
existing
irish
sagas
was
perfectly
familiar
to
the
irish
gael
according
to
another
modern
celtic
authority
de
jubainville
two
chief
celtic
doctrines
or
beliefs
were
the
return
of
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
and
the
of
the
same
individuality
in
a
new
human
body
here
on
this
planet
reincarnation
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
we
proceed
now
directly
to
show
that
there
was
also
a
belief
probably
widespread
among
the
ancient
irish
that
divine
personages
national
heroes
who
are
members
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
race
and
great
men
can
be
reincarnated
that
is
to
say
can
descend
to
this
plane
of
existence
and
be
as
mortals
more
than
once
this
aspect
of
the
celtic
doctrine
of
has
been
clearly
set
forth
by
the
publications
of
such
eminent
celtic
as
alfred
nutt
and
miss
eleanor
hull
miss
hull
in
her
study
of
irish
tabus
or
referring
to
the
cuchulainn
cycle
of
irish
literature
and
mythology
writes
thus
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
chief
personages
of
this
cycle
were
regarded
as
the
direct
descendants
or
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
as
avatars
or
reincarnations
of
the
early
gods
not
only
are
their
pedigrees
traced
up
to
the
tuatha
dé
danann
but
there
are
indications
in
the
of
nearly
all
the
principal
personages
that
they
are
looked
upon
simply
as
divine
beings
reborn
on
the
human
plane
of
life
these
indications
are
mysterious
and
most
of
the
tales
which
deal
with
them
show
signs
of
having
been
altered
perhaps
intentionally
by
the
christian
transcribers
the
doctrine
of
was
naturally
not
one
acceptable
to
them
the
goddess
etain
becomes
the
mortal
wife
of
a
king
of
ireland
conchobhar
moreover
is
spoken
of
as
a
terrestrial
god
and
dechtire
his
sister
and
the
mother
of
cúchulainn
is
called
a
goddess
in
the
case
of
cúchulainn
himself
it
is
distinctly
noted
that
he
is
the
avatar
of
lugh
lamhfada
the
of
the
earliest
cycle
lugh
appears
to
dechtire
the
mother
of
cúchulainn
and
tells
her
that
he
himself
is
her
little
child
that
the
child
is
a
reincarnation
of
himself
and
cúchulainn
when
inquired
of
as
to
his
birth
points
proudly
to
his
descent
from
lugh
when
too
it
is
proposed
to
find
a
wife
for
the
hero
the
reason
assigned
is
that
they
knew
that
his
would
be
of
himself
that
only
from
himself
could
another
such
as
he
have
origin
we
have
in
this
last
a
clue
to
the
popular
irish
belief
regarding
the
of
beings
of
a
nature
de
jubainville
has
shown
also
that
the
grandfather
of
cuchulainn
son
of
sualtaim
was
from
the
country
of
the
and
so
was
ethné
ingubé
the
sister
of
sualtaim
and
dechtire
the
mother
of
cuchulainn
was
the
daughter
of
the
druid
cathba
and
the
brother
of
king
conchobhar
thus
the
ancestry
of
the
great
hero
of
the
red
branch
knights
of
ulster
is
both
royal
and
divine
and
conall
cernach
cuchulainn
comrade
and
avenger
apparently
from
a
tale
in
the
fitness
of
names
composed
probably
during
the
twelfth
century
was
also
a
reincarnated
tuatha
de
danann
hero
practically
all
the
extant
manuscripts
dealing
with
the
ancient
literature
and
mythology
of
the
gaels
were
written
by
christian
scribes
or
else
copied
by
them
from
older
manuscripts
so
that
as
miss
hull
points
out
what
few
irish
stories
have
come
down
to
us
and
they
are
probably
but
remnants
of
an
extensive
literature
like
that
of
india
have
been
more
or
less
altered
yet
to
these
scholarly
scribes
of
the
early
monastic
schools
who
kept
alive
the
sacred
fire
of
learning
while
their
own
country
was
being
plundered
by
foreign
invaders
and
the
rest
of
mediaeval
europe
plunged
in
warfare
the
world
owes
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
to
their
efforts
alone
in
spite
of
a
reshaping
of
matter
naturally
to
be
expected
is
due
almost
everything
recorded
on
parchments
concerning
pagan
ireland
the
story
concerning
king
mongan
we
have
preserved
to
us
a
remarkable
story
in
which
the
characters
are
known
to
be
historical
it
concerns
a
quarrel
between
the
king
of
ulster
mongan
son
of
fiachna
who
according
to
the
of
ireland
by
the
four
i
was
killed
in
by
arthur
son
of
bicor
and
forgoll
the
poet
of
mongan
the
dispute
between
them
was
as
to
the
place
of
the
death
of
fothad
airgdech
a
king
of
ireland
who
was
killed
by
cailte
one
of
the
warriors
of
find
in
a
battle
whose
date
is
fixed
by
the
in
d
forgoll
pretended
that
fothad
had
been
killed
at
duffry
in
leinster
and
mongan
asserted
that
it
was
on
the
river
larne
anciently
ollarba
in
county
antrim
enraged
at
being
contradicted
even
though
it
were
by
the
king
forgoll
threatened
mongan
with
terrible
incantations
and
it
was
agreed
that
unless
mongan
proved
his
assertion
within
three
days
his
queen
should
pass
under
the
control
of
forgoll
mongan
however
had
spoken
truly
and
with
certain
secret
knowledge
and
felt
sure
of
winning
when
the
third
day
was
almost
expired
and
forgoll
had
presented
himself
ready
to
claim
the
wager
there
was
heard
coming
in
the
distance
the
one
whom
mongan
awaited
it
was
cailte
himself
come
from
the
otherworld
to
bear
testimony
to
the
truthfulness
of
the
king
and
to
confound
the
audacious
presumptions
of
the
poet
forgoll
it
was
evening
when
he
reached
the
palace
the
king
mongan
was
seated
on
his
throne
and
the
queen
at
his
right
full
of
fear
about
the
outcome
and
in
front
stood
the
poet
forgoll
claiming
the
wager
no
one
knew
the
strange
warrior
as
he
entered
the
court
save
the
king
cailte
when
fully
informed
of
the
quarrel
and
the
wager
quickly
announced
so
that
all
heard
him
distinctly
poet
has
lied
will
regret
those
words
replied
the
poet
you
say
does
not
well
become
you
responded
cailte
in
turn
i
will
prove
what
i
say
and
straightway
cailte
revealed
this
strange
secret
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
companions
in
arms
under
the
great
warrior
find
who
was
also
his
teacher
and
that
mongan
the
king
before
whom
he
spoke
was
the
reincarnation
of
find
were
with
thee
said
cailte
addressing
the
king
were
with
find
however
replied
mongan
you
do
wrong
in
revealing
a
secret
but
the
warrior
continued
were
therefore
with
find
we
came
from
scotland
we
encountered
fothad
airgdech
near
here
on
the
shores
of
the
ollarba
we
gave
him
furious
battle
i
cast
my
spear
at
him
in
such
a
manner
that
it
passed
through
his
body
and
the
iron
point
detaching
itself
from
the
staff
became
fixed
in
the
earth
on
the
other
side
of
fothad
behold
here
in
my
hand
the
shaft
of
that
spear
there
will
be
found
the
bare
rock
from
the
top
of
which
i
let
fly
my
weapon
there
will
be
found
a
little
further
to
the
east
the
iron
point
sunken
in
the
earth
there
will
be
found
again
a
little
further
always
to
the
east
the
tomb
of
fothad
airgdech
a
coffin
of
stone
covers
his
body
his
two
bracelets
of
silver
his
two
and
his
of
silver
are
in
the
coffin
above
the
tomb
rises
a
and
on
the
upper
extremity
of
that
stone
which
is
planted
in
the
earth
one
may
read
an
inscription
in
ogam
reposes
fothad
airgdech
he
was
fighting
against
find
when
cailte
slew
and
to
the
consternation
of
forgoll
what
this
warrior
who
came
from
the
otherworld
declared
was
true
for
there
were
found
the
place
indicated
by
him
the
rock
the
the
the
inscription
the
coffin
of
stone
the
body
in
it
and
the
jewellery
thus
mongan
gained
the
wager
and
the
secret
of
his
life
which
he
alone
had
known
was
revealed
he
was
find
and
cailte
his
old
pupil
and
had
come
from
the
land
of
the
dead
to
aid
him
was
cailte
find
that
had
come
to
them
mongan
however
was
find
though
he
would
not
let
it
be
told
but
not
only
was
mongan
an
irish
king
he
was
also
a
god
the
son
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
manannan
mac
lir
mongan
is
a
son
of
manannan
mac
lir
though
he
is
called
mongan
son
of
fiachna
and
so
it
is
that
long
after
their
conquest
the
people
of
the
goddess
dana
ruled
their
conquerors
for
they
took
upon
themselves
human
bodies
being
born
as
the
children
of
the
kings
of
mil
sons
there
are
other
episodes
which
show
very
clearly
the
relationship
between
mongan
incarnated
in
a
human
body
and
his
divine
father
manannan
thus
mongan
was
three
nights
old
manannan
came
for
him
and
took
him
with
him
to
bring
up
in
the
land
of
promise
and
vowed
that
he
would
not
let
him
back
into
ireland
before
he
were
twelve
years
of
age
and
after
mongan
has
become
ulster
high
king
manannan
comes
to
him
to
rouse
him
out
of
human
slothfulness
to
a
consciousness
of
his
divine
nature
and
mission
and
of
the
need
of
action
mongan
and
his
wife
were
frittering
away
their
time
playing
a
game
when
they
beheld
a
dark
little
cleric
standing
at
the
who
said
this
inactivity
in
which
thou
art
o
mongan
is
not
an
inactivity
becoming
a
king
of
ulster
not
to
go
to
avenge
thy
father
on
fiachna
the
black
son
of
deman
though
may
think
it
wrong
to
tell
thee
so
mongan
seized
the
kingship
of
ulster
and
the
little
cleric
who
had
done
the
reason
was
manannan
the
great
and
mighty
in
the
ancient
tale
of
the
of
probably
composed
in
its
present
form
during
the
eighth
possibly
the
seventh
century
there
is
another
version
of
the
mongan
story
which
being
later
in
origin
and
composition
than
the
itself
was
undoubtedly
clumsily
inserted
into
the
manuscript
as
scholars
think
therein
mongan
as
the
offspring
of
manannan
by
the
woman
of
quite
after
the
theory
of
the
christian
incarnation
is
described
as
fair
man
in
a
body
of
white
clay
this
and
what
follows
in
the
introductory
quatrain
show
how
early
celtic
doctrines
correspond
to

another
clear
example
of
one
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
being
born
as
a
mortal
is
recorded
in
the
famous
saga
of
the
of
three
fragments
of
this
story
exist
in
the
of
the
dun
the
first
tells
how
etain
echraide
daughter
of
ailill
and
wife
of
midir
a
great
king
among
the
people
was
driven
out
of
fairyland
by
the
jealousy
of
her
husband
other
wife
and
how
after
being
wafted
about
on
the
winds
of
this
world
she
fell
invisibly
into
the
of
the
wife
of
etar
of
inber
cichmaine
who
was
an
ulster
chieftain
the
chieftain
wife
swallowed
her
and
in
due
time
gave
birth
to
a
girl
was
one
thousand
and
twelve
years
from
the
first
begetting
of
etain
by
ailill
to
the
last
begetting
by
etar
etain
retaining
her
own
name
grew
up
thence
as
an
irish
princess
one
day
an
unknown
man
of
very
stately
aspect
suddenly
appeared
to
etain
the
princess
and
as
suddenly
disappeared
after
he
had
sung
to
her
a
wonderful
song
designed
to
arouse
in
her
the
subconscious
memories
of
her
past
existence
among
the
so
is
etain
here
among
little
children
is
her
lot
it
is
she
was
gulped
in
the
drink
by
etar
wife
in
a
heavy
draught
the
scribe
ends
this
part
of
the
story
by
letting
it
be
known
that
midir
has
struck
off
the
head
of
his
other
wife
fuamnach
the
cause
of
all
etain
trouble
the
second
section
of
the
tale
introduces
etain
as
queen
of
eochaid
airem
high
king
of
ireland
and
the
most
curious
and
important
part
of
it
shows
how
she
was
loved
by
ailill
aenguba
ailill
so
far
as
blood
kinship
went
was
the
brother
of
eochaid
though
apparently
either
an
incarnation
of
midir
or
else
possessed
by
him
etain
acceded
to
his
love
but
he
was
under
a
strange
and
on
two
occasions
when
he
attempted
to
advance
his
desires
an
overpowering
sleep
fell
on
him
and
each
time
etain
met
a
man
in
ailill
shape
as
though
it
were
his
bemoaning
his
weakness
on
a
third
occasion
she
asked
who
the
man
was
and
he
declared
himself
to
be
midir
and
besought
her
to
return
with
him
to
the
otherworld
but
her
worldly
or
human
memory
clouded
her
subconscious
memory
and
she
did
not
recognize
midir
yet
promised
to
go
with
him
on
gaining
eochaid
permission
after
this
event
curiously
enough
ailill
was
healed
of
his
strange
in
the
third
part
of
the
story
midir
and
eochaid
are
playing
games
midir
loses
the
first
two
and
with
them
great
riches
but
winning
the
third
claims
the
right
to
place
his
arms
about
etain
and
kiss
her
eochaid
asked
a
month
delay
the
last
day
of
the
month
had
passed
it
was
night
eochaid
in
his
palace
at
tara
awaited
the
coming
of
his
rival
midir
and
though
all
the
doors
of
the
palace
had
been
firmly
closed
for
the
occasion
and
armed
soldiers
surrounded
the
queen
midir
like
a
spirit
suddenly
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
court
and
claimed
the
wager
then
grasping
and
kissing
etain
he
mounted
in
the
air
with
her
and
very
quickly
passed
out
through
the
opening
of
the
great
chimney
in
consternation
king
eochaid
and
his
warriors
hurried
without
the
palace
and
there
on
looking
up
they
saw
two
white
swans
flying
over
tara
bound
together
by
a
golden
chain
the
of
dermot
with
a
difficult
task
before
him
dermot
as
was
the
case
with
mongan
is
reminded
of
his
as
a
hero
in
the
otherworld
with
manannan
mac
lir
and
angus
oge
spoke
fergus
truelips
ollave
and
said
cowardly
and
punily
thou
shrinkest
dermot
for
with
most
potent
manannan
son
of
lir
thou
studiedst
and
wast
brought
up
in
the
land
of
promise
and
in
the
coasts
with
angus
oge
too
the
daghda
son
wast
most
accurately
taught
and
it
is
not
just
that
now
thou
lackest
even
a
moderate
portion
of
their
skill
and
daring
such
as
might
serve
to
convey
finn
and
his
party
up
this
rock
or
bastion
at
these
words
dermot
face
grew
red
he
laid
hold
on
manannan
magic
staves
that
he
had
and
as
once
again
he
redly
blushed
by
dint
of
skill
in
martial
feats
he
with
a
leap
rose
on
his
javelin
shafts
and
so
gained
his
two
soles
breadth
of
the
solid
glebe
that
overhung
the
water
edge
of
tuan
tuan
as
the
son
of
starn
lived
one
hundred
years
as
the
brother
of
partholon
the
first
man
to
reach
ireland
and
then
after
two
hundred
and
twenty
years
was
as
the
son
of
cairell
this
story
in
its
oldest
form
is
preserved
in
the
of
the
dun
and
seems
to
have
been
composed
during
the
late
ninth
or
early
tenth
century
among
the
brythons
such
then
are
the
stories
of
the
gaels
among
the
brythons
the
same
ancient
doctrine
prevailed
though
we
have
fewer
clear
records
of
it
of
the
brythonic
doctrine
as
philosophically
expounded
in
mention
has
already
been
made
in
the
ancient
welsh
story
about
taliessin
gwion
after
many
transformations
magical
in
their
nature
is
as
that
great
poet
of
wales
his
mother
being
a
goddess
caridwen
who
dwells
beneath
the
waters
of
lake
tegid
in
its
present
mystical
form
this
tale
can
not
be
traced
further
than
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
though
the
transformation
incidents
are
presupposed
in
the
of
a
manuscript
besides
being
the
of
gwion
taliessin
may
be
regarded
as
a
bardic
initiate
high
in
degree
who
is
possessed
of
all
magical
and
druidical
powers
he
made
a
voyage
to
the
otherworld
caer
sidi
and
this
seems
to
indicate
some
close
connexion
between
ancient
rites
of
initiation
and
his
occult
knowledge
of
all
things
like
the
irish
and
otherworld
tales
it
also
suggests
the
relation
between
the
world
of
death
or
faerie
and
the
world
of
human
embodiment
from
his
harrying
of
hades
the
brythonic
gwydion
secured
the
head
of
hades
cauldron
of
regeneration
or
and
when
corpses
of
slain
warriors
are
thrown
into
it
they
arise
next
day
as
excellent
as
ever
except
that
they
are
unable
to
speak
which
circumstance
may
be
equal
to
saying
that
the
ordinary
uninitiated
man
when
is
unable
to
speak
of
his
previous
incarnation
because
he
has
no
memory
of
it
this
cauldron
of
like
so
many
objects
mentioned
in
the
ancient
bardic
literature
is
evidently
a
mystic
symbol
it
suggests
the
same
correspondences
as
propounded
in
the
modern
between
the
dead
and
the
living
between
death
and
and
gwydion
having
been
a
great
culture
hero
of
wales
probably
promulgated
a
doctrine
of
and
hence
is
described
as
being
able
to
resuscitate
the
dead
king
arthur
as
a
reincarnated
hero
judging
from
substantial
evidence
set
forth
above
in
chapter
v
the
most
famous
of
all
welsh
heroes
arthur
equally
with
cuchulainn
his
irish
counterpart
can
safely
be
considered
both
as
a
god
apart
from
the
human
plane
of
existence
and
thus
like
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
and
also
like
a
great
national
hero
and
king
such
as
mongan
was
incarnated
in
a
physical
body
the
taking
of
arthur
to
avalon
by
his
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
by
his
own
sister
and
by
two
other
fairy
women
who
live
in
that
otherworld
of
sacred
is
sufficient
in
itself
we
believe
to
prove
him
of
a
descent
more
divine
than
that
of
ordinary
men
and
the
belief
in
his
return
from
that
otherworld
a
return
so
confidently
looked
for
by
the
brythonic
peoples
seems
to
be
a
belief
whether
recognized
as
such
or
not
that
the
great
hero
will
be
reincarnated
as
a
messiah
destined
to
set
them
free
in
avalon
arthur
lives
now
and
is
from
there
that
the
britons
of
england
and
of
france
have
for
a
long
time
awaited
his
coming
and
malory
expressing
the
sentiment
in
his
age
writes
some
men
say
in
many
parts
of
england
that
king
arthur
is
not
dead
but
had
by
the
will
of
our
lord
jesu
into
another
place
and
men
say
that
he
shall
come
again
and
he
shall
win
the
holy
cross
i
will
not
say
it
shall
be
so
but
rather
i
will
say
here
in
this
world
he
changed
his
life
if
we
consider
arthur
passing
and
expected
return
as
many
do
in
a
purely
mythological
aspect
we
must
think
of
him
for
the
time
as
a
and
yet
even
then
can
not
escape
altogether
from
the
idea
for
as
a
study
of
ancient
egyptian
mythology
shows
there
is
still
the
same
set
of
relations
there
are
the
always
made
use
of
to
set
forth
the
doctrine
of
be
it
egyptian
indian
mexican
or
celtic
the
death
of
a
mortal
like
the
passing
of
arthur
is
represented
by
the
on
the
horizon
between
the
visible
world
here
and
the
invisible
world
beyond
the
western
ocean
and
the
is
the
sunrise
of
a
new
day
parallels
as
a
parallel
to
what
has
preceded
concerning
the
otherworld
of
the
celts
and
their
doctrine
of
we
offer
the
second
of
the
of
the
of
as
published
by
griffith
from
ancient
manuscripts
it
is
a
history
of
the
son
of
osiris
whose
father
was
setme
khamuas
this
wonderful
divine
son
when
still
a
child
took
his
human
father
on
a
journey
to
see
amenti
the
otherworld
of
the
dead
and
when
twelve
years
of
age
he
was
wiser
than
the
wisest
of
the
scribes
and
unequalled
in
magic
at
this
period
in
his
life
there
arrived
in
egypt
an
ethiopian
magician
who
came
with
the
object
of
humbling
the
kingdom
but
read
what
was
in
the
unopened
letter
of
the
stranger
and
knew
that
its
bearer
was
the
reincarnation
of
the
son
of
the
negress
the
most
formidable
of
the
three
ethiopian
magicians
who
fifteen
hundred
years
before
had
waged
war
with
the
magicians
of
egypt
at
that
time
the
egyptian
hor
the
son
of
had
defeated
the
great
magician
of
ethiopia
in
the
final
struggle
between
white
and
black
magic
which
took
place
in
the
presence
of
the
pharaoh
and
the
son
of
the
negress
had
agreed
not
to
return
to
egypt
again
for
fifteen
hundred
years
but
now
the
time
was
elapsed
and
unmasking
the
character
of
the
messenger
destroyed
him
with
magical
fire
after
this
revealed
himself
as
the
reincarnation
of
hor
the
son
of
and
declared
that
osiris
had
permitted
him
to
return
to
earth
to
destroy
the
powerful
hereditary
enemy
of
egypt
when
the
revelation
was
made
away
as
a
shade
going
back
again
even
as
the
celtic
arthur
into
the
realm
invisible
from
which
he
came
as
in
ancient
ireland
where
many
kings
or
great
heroes
were
regarded
as
direct
incarnations
or
reincarnations
of
gods
or
divine
beings
from
the
otherworld
so
in
egypt
the
pharaohs
were
thought
to
be
gods
in
human
bodies
sent
by
osiris
to
rule
the
children
of
the
sun
in
mexico
and
peru
there
was
a
similar
belief
in
the
indian
râma
and
krishna
are
at
once
gods
and
men
the
celebrated
philosophical
poem
known
as
the
also
asserts
descent
from
the
gods
and
the
same
view
is
again
enforced
and
extended
in
the
and
especially
in
the
the
indian
of
say
that
an
infant
king
must
not
be
despised
from
an
idea
that
he
is
a
mere
mortal
for
he
is
a
great
deity
in
human
form
in
ancient
greece
it
was
a
common
opinion
that
zeus
was
reincarnated
from
age
to
age
in
the
great
national
heroes
the
great
was
regarded
not
merely
as
the
son
of
zeus
but
as
zeus
himself
and
other
great
greeks
were
regarded
as
gods
while
living
on
earth
like
lycurgus
the
spartan
who
after
his
death
was
worshipped
as
one
of
the
divine
ones
among
the
great
philosophers
the
ancient
doctrine
of
was
a
personal
conviction
buddha
related
very
many
of
his
previous
reincarnations
according
to
the
pythagoras
is
said
to
have
gone
to
the
temple
of
here
and
recognized
there
an
ancient
shield
which
he
had
carried
in
a
previous
life
when
he
was
euphorbus
a
homeric
hero
from
what
plato
in
his
quoted
from
an
old
poet
it
seems
very
probable
that
there
may
be
some
sort
of
relationship
between
legends
mentioning
the
rites
of
proserpine
like
the
legend
of
aeneas
in
virgil
and
certain
of
the
irish
otherworld
and
legends
among
the
gaels
as
we
have
already
suggested
from
whomsoever
persephone
hath
accepted
the
atonement
of
ancient
woe
their
souls
she
sendeth
up
once
more
to
the
upper
sun
in
the
ninth
year
from
these
grow
up
glorious
kings
and
men
of
swift
strength
and
men
surpassing
in
poetical
skill
and
for
all
future
time
they
are
called
holy
heroes
among
men
among
modern
philosophers
and
poets
in
europe
and
america
the
same
ideas
find
their
echo
wordsworth
in
his
to
definitely
inculcates
emerson
in
his
and
tennyson
in
his
seem
committed
to
the
doctrine
and
walt
whitman
in
his
of
without
doubt
accepted
it
as
true
certain
german
philosophers
too
appear
to
hold
views
in
harmony
with
what
is
also
the
celtic
doctrine
of
schopenhauer
in
world
as
will
and
fichte
in
destiny
of
and
herder
in
on
the
emperor
of
japan
is
still
the
divine
child
of
the
sun
the
head
of
the
of
the
rising
and
is
always
regarded
by
his
subjects
as
the
incarnation
of
a
great
being
the
great
lama
of
thibet
is
believed
to
reincarnate
immediately
after
death
william
ii
of
germany
seems
to
echo
perhaps
unconsciously
the
same
doctrine
when
he
claims
to
be
ruling
by
divine
right
that
the
celtic
doctrine
of
is
a
direct
and
complete
confirmation
of
the
psychological
theory
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
the
belief
in
fairies
is
could
it
be
shown
to
be
scientifically
plausible
in
itself
as
celts
consider
it
to
be
and
much
evidence
to
be
derived
from
a
study
of
states
of
consciousness
dreams
somnambulism
trance
changed
personality
subconsciousness
and
so
forth
indicates
that
it
might
be
shown
to
be
so
it
would
effectively
prove
the
theory
fairies
would
then
be
beings
of
the
otherworld
who
can
enter
the
human
plane
of
life
by
submitting
to
the
natural
process
of
birth
in
a
physical
body
and
would
correspond
to
the
ancestors
of
the
arunta
in
chapter
xii
following
such
a
proof
of
the
theory
is
attempted
among
modern
celts
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
this
chapter
is
to
show
that
the
doctrine
of
the
celts
like
most
beliefs
bound
up
with
the
still
survives
thus
further
proving
that
celtic
tradition
is
an
unbroken
thing
from
times
prehistoric
until
we
shall
therefore
proceed
to
bring
forward
the
following
original
material
collected
by
ourselves
as
evidence
on
this
point
in
ireland
i
found
two
districts
where
the
doctrine
has
not
been
wholly
forgotten
the
first
one
is
in
the
country
round
knock
ma
near
tuam
after
had
told
me
about
fairies
i
led
up
to
the
subject
of
and
the
most
valuable
of
all
my
irish
finds
concerning
the
belief
was
the
result
for
this
woman
of
belclare
told
me
that
it
was
believed
by
many
of
the
old
people
when
she
was
a
girl
living
a
few
miles
west
of
knock
ma
that
they
had
lived
on
this
earth
before
as
men
and
women
but
she
added
could
hardly
get
them
to
talk
about
their
belief
it
was
a
sort
of
secret
which
they
who
held
it
discussed
freely
only
among
themselves
they
believed
too
that
disease
and
misfortune
in
old
age
come
as
a
penalty
for
sins
committed
in
a
former
life
this
expiatory
or
purgatorial
aspect
of
the
doctrine
seems
to
have
been
more
widespread
than
the
doctrine
in
its
bare
outlines
for
the
belclare
woman
in
speaking
of
it
was
able
to
recall
from
memories
of
or
fifty
years
ago
what
was
then
a
popular
story
about
a
man
and
an
the
diseased
man
as
he
watches
the
taking
up
his
baskets
contrasts
his
own
wretched
physical
condition
with
the
vigour
and
good
health
of
the
latter
and
attributes
the
misfortune
which
is
upon
himself
to
bad
actions
in
a
life
prior
to
the
one
he
is
then
living
and
here
is
the
unhappy

cold
is
my

there
is

and
sharp

i
am
paying
for
pride
and
you
watching
your
basket
the
teller
of
the
story
insisted
on
giving
me
these
verses
in
irish
for
she
said
they
have
much
less
meaning
in
english
and
i
took
them
down
and
to
verify
them
and
the
story
in
which
they
find
a
place
i
went
to
the
cottage
a
second
time
there
is
no
doubt
therefore
that
the
legend
is
a
genuine
echo
of
the
religion
of
ireland
in
which
reincarnation
appears
to
have
been
clearly
inculcated
and
was
probably
the
common
belief
i
once
asked
steven
ruan
the
galway
piper
if
he
had
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
people
being
born
more
than
once
here
on
this
earth
seeing
that
i
was
seeking
for
traces
of
the
old
irish
doctrine
of
the
answer
he
gave
me
was
this
have
often
heard
it
said
that
people
born
and
dead
come
into
this
world
again
i
have
heard
the
old
people
say
that
we
have
lived
on
this
earth
before
and
i
have
often
met
old
men
and
women
who
believed
they
had
lived
before
the
idea
passed
from
one
old
person
to
another
and
was
a
common
belief
though
you
do
not
hear
much
about
it
now
a
highly
educated
irishman
now
living
in
california
tells
me
of
his
own
knowledge
that
there
was
a
popular
and
sincere
belief
among
many
of
the
irish
people
throughout
ireland
that
charles
parnell
their
great
champion
in
modern
times
was
the
reincarnation
of
one
of
the
old
gaelic
heroes
this
shows
how
the
ancient
doctrine
is
still
practically
applied
there
is
also
an
opinion
held
by
certain
very
prominent
irishmen
now
living
in
ireland
with
whom
i
have
been
privileged
to
discuss
the
doctrine
that
both
patrick
and
columba
are
likewise
to
be
regarded
as
ancient
gaelic
heroes
who
were
reincarnated
to
work
for
the
uplifting
of
the
gael
a
legend
concerning
lough
gur
county
limerick
indicates
that
the
type
of
tale
is
a
curious
aspect
of
an
ancient
doctrine
in
such
tales
heroes
and
their
warrior
companions
are
held
under
enchantment
awaiting
the
mystic
hour
to
strike
for
them
to
issue
forth
and
free
their
native
land
from
the
rule
of
the
saxon
usually
they
are
so
held
within
a
mysterious
cavern
as
is
the
case
of
arthur
and
his
men
according
to
differently
localized
welsh
stories
or
they
are
in
the
depths
of
magic
hills
and
mountains
like
most
irish
heroes
the
heroes
under
enchantment
with
their
companions
are
to
be
considered
as
resident
in
the
otherworld
and
their
return
to
human
action
as
a
return
to
the
human
plane
of
life
the
lough
gur
legend
is
about
garret
fitzgerald
the
earl
of
desmond
who
rebelled
against
queen
elizabeth
modern
regards
him
as
the
guardian
deity
of
the
lough
and
as
dwelling
in
an
enchanted
palace
situated
beneath
its
waters
as
count
john
de
salis
whose
ancestral
home
is
the
lough
gur
estate
assures
me
the
peasants
of
the
region
declare
themselves
convinced
that
the
earl
once
in
seven
years
appears
riding
across
the
lake
surface
on
a
phantom
white
horse
shod
with
shoes
of
silver
and
they
believe
that
when
the
horse
silver
shoes
are
worn
out
the
enchantment
will
end
then
like
arthur
when
his
stay
in
avalon
ends
garret
fitzgerald
will
return
to
the
world
of
human
life
again
to
lead
the
irish
hosts
to
victory
alexander
carmichael
author
of
who
as
a
has
examined
modern
peasant
beliefs
throughout
the
highlands
and
islands
more
thoroughly
than
any
other
living
scotsman
informs
me
that
apparently
there
was
at
one
time
in
the
highlands
a
definite
belief
in
the
ancient
celtic
doctrine
because
he
has
found
traces
of
it
there
though
these
traces
were
only
in
the
vaguest
and
barest
outline
the
isle
of
william
cashen
keeper
of
peel
castle
reported
as
follows
with
respect
to
a
doctrine
in
the
isle
of
man
in
the
island
among
old
manx
people
i
have
heard
it
said
but
only
in
a
joking
way
that
we
will
come
back
to
this
earth
again
after
some
thousands
of
years
the
idea
was
very
popular
nor
often
discussed
and
there
is
no
belief
in
it
now
to
my
knowledge
it
seems
to
have
come
down
from
the
druids
this
is
william
oates
testimony
given
at
ballasalla
held
a
belief
in
the
coming
back
of
spirits
i
ca
explain
it
a
certain
manxman
i
knew
used
to
talk
about
the
transmigration
of
spirits
but
i
shall
not
give
his
name
since
many
of
his
family
still
live
here
on
the
island
thomas
kelley
of
glen
meay
had
no
clear
idea
about
the
ancient
celtic
doctrine
of
though
he
said
grandfather
had
a
notion
that
he
would
be
back
here
again
at
the
resurrection
to
claim
his
land
this
undoubtedly
shows
how
the
christian
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
and
the
celtic
one
of
may
have
blended
both
being
based
on
the
common
idea
of
a
physical
in
the
pentre
evan
country
where
i
discovered
such
rich
i
found
my
chief
witness
from
there
not
unfamiliar
with
the
ancient
celtic
belief
in
one
day
i
asked
her
if
she
had
ever
heard
the
old
folk
say
that
they
had
lived
before
on
this
earth
as
men
and
women
somewhat
surprised
at
the
question
for
to
answer
it
would
reveal
thoughts
of
which
as
it
proved
not
even
her
own
nephew
or
niece
had
knowledge
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
looking
at
me
intently
said
with
great
earnestness
and
i
often
believe
myself
that
i
have
lived
before
and
because
of
the
unusual
question
which
seemed
to
reveal
on
my
part
familiarity
with
the
belief
she
added
i
think
you
must
be
of
the
same
opinion
as
to
yourself
she
explained
then
that
the
belief
was
a
rare
one
now
and
held
by
only
a
few
of
the
oldest
of
her
old
acquaintances
in
that
region
and
they
seldom
talk
about
it
to
their
children
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
ceredig
davies
the
of
llanilar
near
aberystwyth
speaking
of
the
welsh
doctrine
said
he
remembers
while
in
patagonia
having
discussed
druidism
with
a
friend
there
the
late
john
jones
originally
of
bala
north
wales
and
hearing
him
remark
i
have
a
that
i
have
been
in
this
world
before
jones
our
witness
from
pontrhydfendigaid
offers
testimony
of
the
highest
value
concerning
druidism
and
the
doctrine
of
in
central
wales
as
follows
believed
in
and
he
was
the
first
to
interpret
the
druidic
laws
he
believed
that
from
age
to
age
he
had
been
in
many
human
bodies
he
believed
that
he
possessed
the
same
soul
as
enoch
and
eli
that
he
had
been
a
judge
sitting
on
the
case
of
jesus
christ
i
was
a
judge
at
the
crucifixion
he
is
reported
as
saying
and
that
he
had
been
a
prisoner
in
bonds
at
the
court
of
cynfelyn
not
far
from
aberystwyth
for
a
year
and
a
day
two
hundred
years
ago
belief
in
was
common
many
still
held
it
when
i
was
a
boy
and
even
yet
here
in
this
region
some
people
are
imbued
with
the
ancient
faith
of
the
druids
and
firmly
believe
that
the
spirit
migrates
from
one
body
to
another
it
is
said
too
that
a
pregnant
woman
is
able
to
determine
what
kind
of
a
child
she
will
give
birth
to
jones
use
of
the
phrase
from
one
body
to
another
led
us
to
suspect
that
it
might
refer
to
transmigration
into
animal
bodies
which
tylor
in
ii
shows
is
a
distorted
or
corrupted
interpretation
of
what
he
calls
the
reasonable
and
straightforward
doctrine
of
into
human
bodies
only
but
when
we
questioned
jones
further
about
the
matter
he
said
belief
i
refer
to
is
into
human
bodies
i
have
heard
of
witches
being
able
to
change
their
own
body
into
the
body
of
an
animal
or
demon
but
i
never
heard
of
men
transmigrating
into
the
bodies
of
animals
some
people
have
said
that
the
druids
taught
transmigration
of
this
sort
but
i
do
not
think
they
did
though
welsh
poets
seem
to
have
made
use
of
such
a
doctrine
for
the
sake
of
poetry
in
order
to
gain
evidence
concerning
the
doctrine
as
concrete
as
possible
from
so
important
a
witness
as
jones
we
asked
him
further
if
he
could
recall
the
names
of
one
or
two
of
his
old
acquaintances
who
believed
in
it
and
he
said
old
character
named
thomas
williams
a
dyer
by
trade
nearly
believed
in
it
and
shôn
evan
rolant
firmly
believed
in
it
rolant
was
the
owner
of
old
abbey
farm
on
the
estate
and
originally
was
a
and
respectable
farmer
but
in
consequence
of
mortgages
on
the
estate
he
lost
his
property
after
being
dispossessed
and
badly
treated
he
used
to
recite
the
one
hundred
and
ninth
psalm
to
bring
curses
upon
those
who
worked
against
him
in
the
dispossession
process
and
it
was
thought
that
he
succeeded
in
bringing
curses
upon
them
the
rev
morgan
vicar
of
newchurch
parish
near
carmarthen
who
has
already
offered
valuable
evidence
concerning
the
see
pp
contributes
additional
material
about
the
doctrine
of
in
south
wales
father
said
there
used
to
be
expressed
in
cardiganshire
before
his
time
a
belief
in
this
was
in
accord
with
druidism
namely
that
all
human
beings
formerly
existed
on
the
moon
the
world
of
middle
light
and
the
queen
of
heaven
that
those
who
there
lived
a
righteous
life
were
thence
born
on
the
sun
and
thence
onward
to
the
highest
heaven
and
that
those
whose
moon
life
had
been
unrighteous
were
born
on
this
earth
of
suffering
and
sin
through
on
earth
souls
are
able
to
return
to
the
moon
and
then
evolve
to
the
sun
and
highest
heaven
or
through
wrong
living
on
earth
souls
are
born
in
the
third
condition
which
is
one
of
utter
darkness
and
of
still
greater
suffering
and
sin
than
our
world
offers
but
even
from
this
lowest
condition
souls
can
work
upwards
to
the
highest
glory
if
they
strive
successfully
against
evil
the
goddess
of
heaven
or
mother
of
all
human
beings
was
known
as
i
am
unable
to
tell
if
she
is
the
moon
itself
or
lived
in
the
moon
on
the
other
hand
the
sun
was
considered
the
father
of
all
human
beings
according
to
the
old
belief
every
new
moon
brings
the
souls
who
were
unfit
to
be
born
on
the
sun
to
deposit
them
here
on
our
earth
sometimes
there
are
more
souls
seeking
embodiment
on
earth
than
there
are
infant
bodies
to
contain
them
hence
souls
fight
among
themselves
to
occupy
a
body
occasionally
one
soul
tries
to
drive
out
from
a
body
the
soul
already
in
possession
of
it
in
order
to
possess
it
for
itself
in
consequence
of
such
struggling
of
soul
against
soul
men
in
this
world
manifest
madness
and
tear
themselves
whenever
such
a
condition
showed
itself
the
person
exhibiting
it
was
called
a
or
one
who
is
meaning
moon
and
to
notch
or
tear
and
in
the
english
word
meaning
we
have
a
similar
idea
david
williams
of
carmarthen
who
has
already
told
us
much
about
welsh
fairies
see
pp
offers
equally
valuable
information
about
the
circles
of
existence
and
the
druidic
scheme
of
as
follows
to
the
druids
there
are
three
circles
through
which
souls
must
pass
the
first
is
y
the
second
the
third
y
the
name
of
each
circle
refers
to
a
special
kind
of
spiritual
training
and
if
in
reaching
the
second
circle
you
do
not
gain
its
perfection
by
completing
all
its
provisions
probably
in
due
order
and
time
you
must
begin
again
in
circle
one
but
if
you
reach
the
perfection
of
circle
two
you
go
on
to
circle
three
in
circle
one
which
is
unlocated
the
soul
has
no
condition
of
bodily
existence
as
in
circle
two
the
second
circle
appears
to
be
a
state
something
like
the
one
we
are
in
now
a
mixture
of
good
and
evil
the
third
circle
is
a
state
of
perfection
and
blessedness
in
it
the
soul
environments
correspond
to
all
its
wishes
and
desires
and
there
is
contact
with
god
at
this
point
i
asked
if
there
was
loss
of
individuality
in
circle
three
and
williams
replied
there
is
not
loss
of
individuality
hence
as
we
suggest
y
is
the
druidic
parallel
to
the
nirvana
of
indian
metaphysics
being
like
it
a
state
of
perfect
and
unlimited
which
man
never
knows
in
and
finally
williams
said
in
relation
to
the
years
there
lived
an
old
bard
in
glamorganshire
who
was
actually
a
druid
though
he
professed
to
be
a
christian
as
well
and
he
believed
fully
in
his
common
name
was
edward
williams
iolo
morganwg
and
he
with
owen
jones
and
william
pughe
edited
the
famous
of
henry
maddern
our
very
important
witness
from
penzance
testifies
as
follows
concerning
a
doctrine
in
cornwall
in
reincarnation
was
very
common
among
the
old
cornish
peoples
for
example
it
was
believed
when
an
incantation
had
been
pronounced
in
the
proper
way
at
the
newlyn
tolcarne
that
the
troll
who
inhabited
it
could
embody
the
person
who
called
him
up
in
any
state
in
which
that
person
had
existed
during
a
former
age
you
had
only
to
name
the
age
or
period
and
you
could
live
your
past
life
therein
over
again
my
nurse
betty
grancan
and
an
old
miner
named
william
edwards
both
believed
in
and
told
me
about
it
i
have
heard
them
relate
stories
to
one
another
to
the
effect
that
a
person
can
go
back
into
the
memory
of
past
lives
they
said
that
the
sex
always
remains
the
same
from
life
to
life
i
have
never
heard
of
any
belief
in
transmigration
of
humans
into
animals
but
in
human
only

says
that
there
is
now
among
his
breton
countrymen
round
carnac
a
general
and
profound
belief
that
spirits
incarnate
as
men
and
women
and
he
has
told
me
that
this
belief
exists
also
in
other
regions
of
the
morbihan
and
i
myself
found
there
in
this
carnac
country
of
which
le
rouzic
speaks
that
the
doctrine
of
the
reincarnation
of
ancestors
which
as
he
agrees
is
the
same
thing
as
the
incarnation
of
spirits
is
quite
common
though
as
a
rule
only
talked
about
among
the
bretons
themselves
le
rouzic
restated
the
belief
as
he
knows
it
round
carnac
as
follows
is
incontestable
that
the
belief
in
the
reincarnation
of
spirits
is
general
in
our
country
and
it
is
believed
that
the
spirits
embodied
now
are
the
spirits
of
the
people
of
former
times
after
louis
guézel
of
the
village
of
columban
a
mile
from
carnac
had
related
to
me
certain
legends
of
the
dead
i
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
heard
that
the
dead
may
be
born
again
as
men
and
women
here
on
this
earth
contrary
to
my
expectations
the
question
caused
no
surprise
whatever
and
i
was
at
once
given
the
impression
that
the
ancient
celtic
doctrine
of
is
a
thoroughly
familiar
one
to
him
and
to
many
bretons
about
the
carnac
district
as
we
conversed
about
the
doctrine
he
said
emphatically
la
it
is
the
truth
and
in
illustration
told
the
following
anecdotes
woman
in
a
cemetery
one
evening
saw
the
spirits
of
many
dead
children

of
her
life
and
reincarnation
a
son
of
my

my

in
his

this
poetical

to
his

thereby
admirably
echoes
the
ancient
breton
doctrine
of
your

your

you

this
also
you
confess
to
me
yourself
these
unfathomable
epochs
remain
for
you
actual
and
present
origin
and
evolution
of
the
celtic
doctrine
of
in
considering
briefly
what
doctrines
could
conceivably
have
shaped
the
celtic
doctrine
of
two
chief
streams
of
influence
are
open
to
examination
one
stream
has
its
source
in
doctrines
like
those
set
forth
by
orphic
pythagorean
platonic
and
similar
philosophies
while
the
other
arises
out
of
primitive
christianity
wherein
as
literary
and
historical
evidence
suggests
may
have
been
an
equally
important
doctrine
or
at
all
events
there
was
a
decided
tendency
later
condemned
as
heretical
to
synthesize
the
alexandrian
philosophy
and
the
jewish
which
to
some
extent
influenced
the
alexandrian
with
early
church
doctrines
this
tendency
is
clearly
shown
by
origen
and
by
clemens
alexandrinus
another
eminent
father
we
have
a
better
check
on
the
second
stream
than
on
the
first
because
christianity
has
a
later
and
more
definite
origin
than
any
of
the
philosophies
some
of
the
druids
chiefly
of
scotland
and
wales
who
are
known
to
have
held
the
doctrine
before
conversion
and
probably
after
conversion
as
was
the
case
with
a
modern
druid
an
editor
of
the
of
see
above
accepted
the
new
faith
as
a
purer
form
of
druidism
and
jesus
christ
as
the
greatest
of
druids
this
ready
and
full
acceptance
would
most
likely
not
have
been
possible
had
their
cardinal
doctrine
been
thereby
condemned
it
would
seem
therefore
that
a
primitive
christian
doctrine
may
have
been
openly
held
by
certain
of
the
early
celtic
missionaries
these
latter
during
the
centuries
when
ireland
was
the
university
for
all
europe
had
good
opportunities
for
knowing
much
about
the
earliest
traditions
of
christianity
and
they
with
their
own
instincts
would
have
given
approval
to
such
a
doctrine
without
consulting
rome
just
as
church
fathers
like
tertullian
condemned
it
on
their
own
personal
authority
and
origen
believed
it
further
if
we
hold
in
mind
that
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
even
now
inculcates
that
the
son
and
united
himself
with
a
human
soul
in
the
act
of
conception
and
that
it
may
originally
and
by
some
irish
saints
have
been
thought
of
as
applying
to
all
mankind
in
a
more
humble
and
less
divine
way
we
seem
to
see
in
the
mongan
story
which
christian
transcribers
have
glossed
evidently
with
such
ideas
in
mind
a
proof
that
on
this
doctrinal
point
christian
and
celtic
beliefs
coalesced
but
the
christian
beliefs
did
not
originate
the
celtic
for
scholars
have
shown
that
the
germ
of
the
mongan
story
as
well
as
that
of
the
cuchulainn
episode
is
and
that
the
etain
dates
from
a
time
when
irish
myth
and
history
were
entirely
free
from
christian
influence
the
same
original
pagan
character
is
shown
in
the
episodes
existing
in
brythonic
literature
and
finally
from
the
testimony
of
several
ancient
authorities
julius
caesar
diodorus
siculus
pomponius
mela
and
lucan
who
wrote
respectively
about
and
to
that
the
celts
already
held
the
doctrine
it
is
certain
that
any
possible
influence
from
the
christian
stream
instead
of
originating
the
celtic
doctrine
of
could
merely
have
modified
it
the
question
remaining
would
the
classical
or
oriental
doctrines
of
have
originated
or
fundamentally
shaped
the
celtic
doctrine
is
a
very
difficult
one
at
present
it
can
not
be
answered
with
certainty
either
negatively
or
positively
we
may
suppose
however
as
we
did
in
the
case
of
the
parallel
christian
doctrine
a
possible
contact
and
amalgamation
brought
about
in
various
ways
through
oriental
merchants
like
the
phoenicians
and
travellers
who
visited
britain
in
times
but
chiefly
through
the
continental
celts
who
had
direct
knowledge
of
greek
and
roman
culture
meeting
their
insular
brethren
beyond
the
channel
and
irish
sea
all
such
ancient
contacts
push
the
problem
further
and
further
back
in
time
and
our
easiest
and
safest
course
is
to
state
as
we
may
of
the
similar
problem
of
the
origin
of
the
celtic
otherworld
belief
that
available
facts
of
comparative
religion
philosophy
and
myth
indicate
clearly
a
prehistoric
epoch
when
there
was
a
common
ancestral
stock
for
the
mediterranean
and
cultures
this
may
have
had
its
beginnings
in
the
danube
country
or
in
north
europe
as
many
authorities
in
ethnology
now
hold
or
as
others
are
beginning
to
hold
in
the
lost
atlantis
the
most
probable
home
of
the
dark
peoples
of
ireland
isle
of
man
scotland
britain
southern
and
western
europe
and
north
africa
who
with
the
aryans
are
the
joint
ancestors
of
the
modern
celts
both
branches
of
this
common
celtic
ancestral
stock
held
the
doctrine
and
at
least
from
their
aryan
ancestors
it
seems
to
have
been
inherited
by
the
celts
of
history
to
attempt
a
hypothetical
proof
that
this
race
or
that
race
egyptian
phoenician
greek
or
celtic
as
the
case
may
be
is
alone
the
originator
of
this
or
any
other
particular
belief
is
as
useless
and
as
absurd
as
to
attempt
proof
that
the
gael
has
no
racial
affinity
with
the
brython
one
of
the
greatest
services
now
being
performed
by
scientific
inquiry
into
human
problems
is
the
demonstration
of
the
unreasonableness
of
assuming
artificial
social
barriers
separating
race
from
race
religion
from
religion
and
institution
from
institution
and
the
declaration
that
the
unity
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
is
a
fact
inherent
in
man
own
nature
and
not
a
sentimental
ideal
but
there
is
specialization
and
differentiation
everywhere
in
nature
and
while
celtic
traditions
and
beliefs
are
not
fundamentally
unlike
those
found
in
every
age
race
and
cultural
stage
the
treatment
of
this
common
stock
of
prehistoric
lore
and
mystical
religion
is
in
some
respects
unique
and
hence
celtic

statement

paused
before
a

mound
grown
over
with
trees
and
around
it
silver
clear
in
the
moonlight
were
immense
stones
piled
the
remains
of
an

there
was

in

the
popular
belief
among
celtic
peoples
that
tumuli
dolmens
menhirs
and
in
fact
most
megalithic
monuments
prehistoric
or
historic
are
either
the
abodes
or
else
the
favourite
haunts
of
various
orders
of
fairies
of
pixies
in
cornwall
of
in
brittany
of
little
spirits
like
pygmies
of
spirits
like
mortals
in
stature
of
goblins
of
demons
and
of
ghosts
interesting
attempts
have
been
made
to
explain
this
by
means
of
the
pygmy
theory
of
fairies
and
this
appears
to
be
almost
the
chief
one
upon
which
the
theory
depends
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
introduction
xxiii
possibly
one
of
the
many
threads
interwoven
into
the
complex
fabric
of
the
round
an
original
psychical
pattern
may
have
been
bequeathed
by
a
of
some
unknown
perhaps
pygmy
races
who
may
have
inhabited
underground
places
like
those
in
certain
tumuli
but
even
though
the
pygmy
theory
were
altogether
accepted
by
us
the
problem
we
are
to
consider
would
still
be
an
unsolved
one
for
how
explain
by
the
pygmy
theory
why
the
should
always
run
in
psychical
channels
and
not
alone
in
celtic
lands
but
throughout
europe
and
even
in
australia
america
africa
and
india
archaeological
researches
have
now
made
it
clear
that
many
of
the
great
tumuli
covering
dolmens
or
subterranean
chambers
like
that
of
mont
michel
at
carnac
for
example
were
religious
and
funereal
in
their
purposes
from
the
first
and
therefore
the
pygmy
theory
is
far
from
a
satisfactory
or
adequate
explanation
to
us
the
inquiry
is
similar
to
an
investigation
into
the
reasons
why
ghosts
should
haunt
a
house
whereas
the
supporters
of
the
pygmy
theory
forget
the
ghosts
and
tell
all
about
the
people
who
may
or
who
may
never
have
lived
in
the
haunted
house
and
who
built
it
the
megaliths
in
the
plain
language
of
the
are
haunted
by
fairies
pixies
ghosts
and
various
sorts
of
invisible
beings
like
the
psychical
research
society
we
believe
there
may
be
or
actually
are
invisible
beings
like
ghosts
and
so
propose
to
conduct
our
investigations
from
that
point
of
view
menhirs
dolmens
cromlechs
and
tumuli
to
begin
with
we
shall
concern
ourselves
with
menhirs
dolmens
cromlechs
and
certain
kinds
of
tumuli
such
as
are
found
at
carnac
round
which
hold
their
nightly
revels
and
where
forms
are
sometimes
seen
in
the
moonlight
or
even
when
there
is
no
moon
paul
sébillot
in
de
has
very
adequately
described
the
numerous
and
customs
connected
with
all
such
monuments
and
it
remains
for
us
to
deal
especially
with
the
psychical
aspects
of
these
traditions
and
customs
the
learned
canon
mahé
in
his
sur
les
antiquités
du
département
du
a
work
of
rare
merit
published
at
vannes
in
holds
that
not
only
were
the
majestic
alignements
of
carnac
used
as
temples
for
religious
rites
but
that
the
stones
themselves
of
which
the
alignements
are
formed
were
venerated
as
the
abodes
of
gods
and
quoting
porphyry
iamblichus
proclus
hermes
and
others
he
shows
that
the
ancients
believed
that
gods
and
daemons
attracted
by
sacrifice
and
worship
to
stone
images
and
other
inanimate
objects
overshadowed
them
or
even
took
up
their
abode
in
them
this
position
of
canon
mahé
is
confirmed
by
a
comparative
study
of
celtic
and
traditions
respecting
the
theory
of
what
has
been
erroneously
called
all
evidence
goes
to
show
that
idols
so
called
are
simply
images
used
as
media
for
the
manifestation
of
ghosts
spirits
and
gods
the
ancients
like
contemporary
primitive
races
do
not
seem
ever
to
have
actually
worshipped
such
images
but
simply
to
have
supplicated
by
prayer
and
sacrifice
the
indwelling
deity
the
ancient
egyptians
for
example
conceived
the
or
personality
as
a
thing
separable
from
the
person
or
body
and
hence
statue
of
a
human
being
represented
and
embodied
a
human
likewise
a
statue
of
a
god
was
the
of
a
divine
attracted
to
it
by
certain
mystical
formulae
at
the
time
of
dedication
though
there
might
be
many
statues
of
the
same
god
no
two
were
alike
each
was
animated
by
an
independent
which
the
rites
of
consecration
had
elicited
from
the
god
these
statues
being
thus
animated
by
a
manifested
their
will
as
greek
and
roman
statues
are
reported
to
have
done
either
by
speaking
or
by
rhythmic
movements
the
divine
virtue
residing
in
the
images
of
the
gods
was
thought
to
be
a
sort
of
fluid
analogous
to
what
we
call
the
magnetic
fluid
the
aura
it
could
be
transmitted
by
the
imposition
of
hands
and
by
magic
passes
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
or
along
the
dorsal
spine
of
a
patient
and
no
doubt
extraordinary
curative
properties
were
attributed
to
it
tylor
has
brought
together
examples
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
of
fetishism
which
is
veneration
paid
to
natural
living
objects
such
as
trees
fish
animals
as
well
as
to
inanimate
objects
of
almost
every
conceivable
description
including
stones
because
of
the
spirit
believed
to
be
inherent
or
resident
in
the
particular
object
and
he
shows
that
idols
originally
were
fetishes
which
in
time
came
to
be
shaped
according
to
the
form
of
the
spirit
or
god
supposed
to
possess
them
marett
the
originator
of
the
theory
believes
that
originally
fetishes
were
regarded
as
gods
themselves
and
that
gradually
they
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
dwellings
of
gods
certain
celtic
traditions
entirely
fit
in
with
this
theory
canon
mahé
writes
accordance
with
this
strange
theory
they
the
celts
could
believe
that
rocks
set
in
motion
by
spirits
which
animated
them
sometimes
went
to
drink
at
rivers
as
is
said
of
the
peulvan
at
morbihan
and
i
have
found
a
parallel
belief
at
rollright
oxfordshire
england
where
it
is
said
of
the
king
stone
an
ancient
menhir
and
according
to
some
a
human
being
transformed
that
it
goes
down
the
hill
on
christmas
eve
to
drink
at
the
river
in
the
famous
menhir
or
on
tara
to
this
day
we
have
another
curious
example
like
the
moving
statues
in
egypt
and
the
celtic
stones
which
move
for
in
the
of
the
wonderful
properties
of
the
the
of
destiny
are
enumerated
and
it
is
said
that
ever
when
monarch
stepped
upon
it
the
stone
would
cry
out
under
him
but
that
if
any
other
person
stepped
upon
it
there
was
only
silence
in
the
life
of
it
is
said
that
ireland
chief
idol
was
at
mag
slecht
and
by
name
cruaich
covered
with
gold
and
silver
and
twelve
other
idols
were
about
it
covered
with
brass
when
patrick
tried
to
place
his
crosier
on
the
top
of
cenn
cruaich
the
idol
westward
to
turn
on
its
right
side
for
its
face
was
from
the
south
to
wit
tara
and
the
earth
swallowed
the
twelve
other
images
as
far
as
their
heads
and
they
are
thus
in
sign
of
the
miracle
and
he
cursed
the
demon
and
banished
him
to
hell
sir
john
rhŷs
points
out
that
means
or
chief
of
the
mound
and
that
the
story
of
its
inclined
position
suggests
to
us
an
ancient
and
gradually
falling
menhir
planted
on
the
summit
of
a
tumulus
or
hill
surrounded
by
twelve
lesser
pillar
stones
all
thirteen
itself
a
sacred
number
regarded
as
the
abodes
of
gods
or
else
as
gods
themselves
and
these
gods
are
referred
to
as
the
demon
exorcized
from
the
place
by
patrick
the
central
menhir
or
cenn
cruaich
probably
represents
the
solar
god
and
the
twelve
menhirs
surrounding
this
probably
represent
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
in
the
it
is
said
that
patrick
went
his
way
sow
faith
and
piety
to
banish
devils
and
wizards
out
of
ireland
to
raise
up
saints
and
righteous
to
erect
crosses
and
altars
also
to
overthrow
idols
and
goblin
images
and
the
whole
art
of
sorcery
welsh
tradition
says
that
david
split
the
capstone
of
the
maen
ketti
cromlech
dolmen
in
gower
in
order
to
prove
to
the
people
that
there
was
nothing
divine
in
it
according
to
geoffrey
of
monmouth
merlin
constructed
stonehenge
by
magically
transporting
from
ireland
the
of
the
giants
apparently
an
ancient
irish
circle
of
stones
the
rational
explanation
of
this
myth
seems
to
be
that
the
stones
of
stonehenge
not
belonging
to
the
native
rocks
of
south
england
as
geologists
well
know
were
probably
transported
from
some
distant
part
of
britain
and
set
up
on
salisbury
plain
because
of
some
magical
properties
supposed
to
have
been
possessed
by
them
and
most
likely
stones
were
regarded
as
divine
or
as
seats
of
divine
power
and
further
thereby
admitting
the
sacred
purpose
of
the
group
sir
john
rhŷs
sees
no
objection
to
identifying
stonehenge
with
the
famous
temple
of
apollo
in
the
island
of
the
hyperboreans
referred
to
in
the
journal
of
pytheas
travels
according
to
sir
john
rhŷs
interpretation
of
this
journal
kings
of
the
city
containing
the
temple
and
the
overseers
of
the
latter
were
the
boreads
who
took
up
the
government
in
succession
according
to
their
tribes
the
citizens
gave
themselves
up
to
music
harping
and
chanting
in
honour
of
the
who
was
every
nineteenth
year
wont
himself
to
appear
about
the
time
of
the
vernal
equinox
and
to
go
on
harping
and
dancing
in
the
sky
until
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
two
menhirs
roughly
hewn
to
simulate
the
human
form
are
yet
to
be
found
in
guernsey
channel
islands
and
formerly
there
was
a
similar
menhir
in
the
breton
village
of
baud
morbihan
one
of
the
guernsey
figures
was
dug
up
in
under
the
chancel
of
the
câtel
church
and
then
placed
in
the
churchyard
so
that
in
this
instance
it
seems
highly
probable
that
the
christian
church
was
built
on
the
site
of
a
sacred
pagan
shrine
where
a
cult
of
stones
once
existed
the
second
stone
figure
a
female
now
standing
as
a
in
the
churchyard
of
martin
parish
seems
also
to
mark
a
spot
where
a
sanctuary
was
christianized
the
of
the
district
up
to
the
middle
of
the
last
century
considered
it
lucky
to
make
floral
and
even
food
offerings
to
this
stone
but
in
the
churchwarden
to
destroy
its
sanctity
had
it
broken
in
two
though
now
it
has
been
restored
a
like
stone
image
was
the
famous
de
quinipilly
near
baud
morbihan
at
its
base
was
a
stone
trough
wherein
until
late
into
the
seventeenth
century
the
sick
were
cured
by
contact
with
the
image
and
young
men
and
maidens
were
wont
to
bathe
to
secure
love
and
long
life
canon
mahé
recorded
in
that
the
located
ghosts
and
spirits
of
the
dead
round
megalithic
monuments
more
especially
those
known
to
have
been
used
for
tombs
because
the
celts
thought
them
haunted
by
ancestral
spirits
and
what
was
true
in
is
true
now
for
there
is
still
in
brittany
the
association
of
ancestral
spirits
and
other
tribes
with
tumuli
dolmens
menhirs
and
cromlechs
and
as
we
have
shown
in
chapter
ii
a
very
living
faith
in
the
de
la
in
describing
some
curious
dolmens
and
cromlechs
stone
circles
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
called
the
or
er
of
the
bell
at
mendon
arrondissement
de
lorient
morbihan
the
same
author
gives
it
as
his
opinion
based
on
that
the
cromlechs
like
others
in
brittany
were
places
in
which
the
ancient
bretons
practised
necromancy
and
invoked
the
spirits
of
their
ancestors
to
whom
they
attributed
great
power
he
then
records
a
very
valuable
and
interesting
tradition
concerning
these
monuments
which
seems
to
indicate
clearly
a
close
relationship
between
the
another
name
for
thought
of
as
spirits
by
the
peasants
and
the
magical
rites
conducted
in
the
circles
to
invoke
spirits
or
daemons
people
call
the
stones
which
are
found
there
the
rocks
of
the
or
who
are
the
same
as
the
and
they
declare
that
at
fixed
seasons
they
are
in
the
habit
of
coming
there
to
celebrate
their
mysteries
which
would
prove
that
the
race
of
these
dwarfs
is
not
yet
extinct
as
i
believed
when
we
hear
how
dance
the
national
breton
or
at
or
in
such
cromlechs
themselves
like
the
dance
circular
in
form
which
with
other
ancient
stone
monuments
and
earthworks
are
still
believed
to
be
the
favourite
haunts
of
these
and
kindred
we
seem
to
see
in
the
light
of
what
canon
mahé
records
a
psychical
about
a
goblin
race
who
are
now
thought
of
as
frequenting
the
very
places
where
anciently
such
spirits
are
said
to
have
been
invoked
by
pagan
priests
for
the
purposes
of
divination
further
it
appears
that
at
these
sacred
centres
as
the
quoted
tradition
indicates
in
prehistoric
times
brythonic
initiations
took
place
like
those
still
flourishing
among
a
few
surviving
american
indian
tribes
who
also
dance
the
circular
initiation
dance
and
among
other
primitive
peoples
as
we
shall
more
adequately
show
in
the
chapter
on
patrick
purgatory
the
breton
dance
is
therefore
most
likely
the
memorial
of
an
ancient
initiation
dance
religious
in
character
and
probably
in
honour
of
the
sun
being
circular
in
the
same
way
that
cromlechs
dedicated
to
a
are
circular
stonehenge
the
most
highly
developed
type
of
the
cromlech
was
undoubtedly
a
and
the
dance
anciently
held
in
it
as
described
by
pytheas
in
honour
of
the
god
apollo
was
no
doubt
circular
like
the
breton
national
dance
and
presumably
initiatory
through
a
natural
anthropomorphic
process
this
circular
initiation
dance
has
come
to
be
attributed
to
in
brittany
to
pixies
in
cornwall
and
in
england
and
to
fairies
in
these
and
other
celtic
countries
the
idea
of
fairy
tribes
in
such
a
special
relation
may
result
from
a
of
the
actual
initiators
who
as
masked
men
represented
spirits
and
if
this
be
a
plausible
view
then
fairies
may
be
compared
to
the
initiators
of
contemporary
initiation
ceremonies
among
primitive
peoples
and
following
gilbert
murray
theory
to
the
greek
satyrs
also
a
circular
dance
like
the
breton
one
still
survives
among
the
peasantry
in
the
channel
islands
at
least
in
guernsey
alderney
and
sark
being
celebrated
at
weddings
but
the
revolution
is
now
around
a
person
instead
of
a
stone
and
to
this
person
obeisance
is
paid
this
tends
to
confirm
our
opinion
that
the
dance
is
the
survival
of
an
ancient
the
central
figure
being
typical
of
the
sun
deity
himself
or
apollo
and
if
we
design
this
dance
thus
we
have
the
astronomical
emblem
still
used
in
all
our
calendars
to
represent
the
sun
one
which
in
itself
preserves
a
vast
mass
of
forgotten
lore
formerly
in
guernsey
the
sites
of
principal
dolmens
or
cromlechs
and
were
visited
in
sacred
procession
and
round
certain
of
them
the
whole
body
of
pilgrims
revolved
three
times
from
east
to
west
as
the
sun
moves
again
according
to
canon
mahé
the
bases
and
lower
parts
of
the
sides
of
four
singular
barrows
at
blend
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
an
enclosed
court
and
one
of
the
barrows
has
been
pierced
as
though
for
a
into
this
court
and
he
holds
that
it
is
more
than
probable
that
these
ancient
earthworks
when
first
they
were
raised
and
others
like
them
in
various
celtic
lands
witnessed
many
mystic
and
religious
rites
and
sacred
tribal
assemblies
the
supposition
that
the
earthworks
were
originally
dedicated
to
pagan
religious
usages
is
very
much
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
in
very
early
times
a
christian
chapel
was
erected
near
them
mont
michel
at
carnac
is
another
example
of
a
pagan
tumulus
dedicated
to
a
christian
saint
and
as
sir
john
rhŷs
says
the
archangel
michael
appears
in
more
places
than
one
in
celtic
lands
as
the
supplanter
of
the
dark
powers
not
only
were
tumuli
thus
transferred
by
from
pagan
gods
to
christian
saints
but
dolmens
and
menhirs
as
well
thus
for
example
at
morbihan
there
is
a
menhir
surmounted
by
a
christian
cross
just
as
at
dol
a
wooden
crucifix
surmounts
the
great
menhir
and
at
carnac
there
is
a
dolmen
likewise
christianized
by
a
stone
on
the
again
déchelette
in
his
préhistorique
celtique
et
describes
a
dolmen
at
plouaret
converted
into
a
chapel
dedicated
to
the
seven
saints
and
another
dolmen
at
charente
likewise
transformed
into
a
place
of
worship
miss
edith
carey
thus
explains
the
dolmens
in
the
channel
islands
our
old
traditions
prove
our
dolmens
to
have
been
the
general
rendezvous
of
our
insular
sorcerers
in
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
century
manuscripts
i
have
found
these
dolmens
described
as
altars
of
the
gods
of
the
sea
one
of
our
ancient
dolmens
retains
its
ancient
name
of
de
hus
and
a
perchage
of
fief
de
léree
tells
us
that
a
now
destroyed
dolmen
on
our
western
coast
was
dedicated
to
the
same
god
for
heus
or
hesus
was
the
of
ancient
gaul
the
same
writer
describes
excavations
made
at
de
hus
by
lukis
and
that
he
found
in
a
side
chamber
there
two
kneeling
skeletons
one
facing
the
north
the
other
the
south
he
considered
them
to
have
been
of
young
persons
probably
interred
alive
as
a
funeral
or
propitiatory
sacrifice
to
some
tribal
chief
or
else
to
a
presiding
deity
of
the
dolmen
beside
a
tomb
of
the
early
bronze
age
at
the
bottom
of
a
large
tumulus
near
mammarlöf
in
skåne
oscar
montelius
the
famous
archaeologist
of
sweden
discovered
a
circular
stone
altar
on
which
reposed
charcoal
and
the
remains
of
a
burnt
animal
offering
which
undoubtedly
was
made
to
the
dead
schliemann
made
a
parallel
discovery
in
an
ancient
tomb
at
mycenae
greece
curiously
in
india
the
dravidian
tribes
a
aboriginal
race
worship
at
the
ancient
dolmens
in
their
forests
and
mountains
whether
as
at
tombs
and
hence
to
ancestral
spirits
or
to
gods
is
not
always
clear
but
the
latter
form
of
worship
is
probably
more
common
since
walhouse
once
observed
one
of
their
performing
a
propitiatory
service
to
the
agricultural
or
earth
deities
the
passed
the
night
in
solitude
sitting
the
capstone
of
a
dolmen
with
heels
and
hams
drawn
together
and
chin
on
knee
evidently
thus
to
await
the
advent
of
the
all
the
above
illustrations
mostly
celtic
ones
tend
to
prove
that
menhirs
certain
tumuli
and
earthworks
cromlechs
and
dolmens
were
originally
connected
with
religious
usages
chiefly
with
a
cult
of
gods
and
beings
and
though
less
commonly
with
the
dead
we
pass
now
to
a
special
consideration
of
chambered
tumuli
to
show
that
the
same
apparently
holds
true
of
them
new
grange
and
celtic
mysteries
though
as
professor
loth
and
other
eminent
archaeologists
hold
all
tumuli
containing
chambers
and
all
of
dolmens
should
be
considered
as
designedly
funereal
in
their
purposes
nevertheless
certain
of
the
greater
ones
like
new
grange
and
gavrinis
may
also
properly
be
considered
as
places
for
rendering
worship
or
even
sacrifice
to
the
dead
and
perhaps
as
places
for
religious
pilgrimages
and
sacred
rites
this
too
seems
to
be
the
opinion
of
déchelette
in
his
work
on
celtic
and
archaeology
as
he
traces
from
the
earliest
prehistoric
times
in
europe
the
evolution
of
the
cult
of
the
dead
according
to
the
evidence
furnished
by
the
ancient
megalithic
monuments
to
begin
with
let
us
take
as
a
type
for
our
study
the
most
famous
of
all
celtic
tumuli
that
of
new
grange
on
the
river
boyne
in
ireland
in
irish
literature
new
grange
is
constantly
associated
with
the
tuatha
de
danann
as
one
of
their
palaces
as
our
fourth
chapter
points
out
throughout
our
second
section
generally
the
testimony
indicates
that
the
essential
nature
of
these
is
subjective
or
spiritual
these
two
facts
at
the
outset
are
very
important
and
fundamental
because
we
expect
to
show
even
more
clearly
than
we
have
just
done
in
the
case
of
menhirs
dolmens
cromlechs
and
smaller
tumuli
that
the
under
consideration
is
at
bottom
a
psychical
one
which
has
grown
up
out
of
a
of
the
time
when
as
has
just
been
said
celtic
or
tumuli
were
used
for
interments
and
probably
certain
ones
among
them
as
places
for
the
celebration
of
pagan
mysteries
george
coffey
the
eminent
archaeologist
in
charge
of
the
archaeological
collections
of
the
royal
irish
academy
quotes
from
ancient
irish
records
in
the
na
and
other
manuscripts
to
show
that
the
early
traditions
refer
to
the
boyne
country
as
the
of
the
kings
of
tara
and
that
sometimes
they
seem
to
associate
with
the
tumuli
on
the
boyne
but
no
exact
identification
being
possible
it
can
not
be
said
with
certainty
whether
any
one
of
the
three
great
boyne
tumuli
is
meant
even
though
it
could
be
shown
conclusively
that
some
mighty
hero
or
king
had
actually
been
entombed
in
new
grange
as
is
likely
in
the
earth
behind
the
chamber
under
the
chamber
floor
or
even
within
the
chamber
still
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
most
of
the
great
irish
heroes
and
kings
were
in
popular
belief
literally
gods
incarnate
and
therefore
as
commonly
among
all
ancient
peoples
civilized
and
who
held
the
same
doctrine
the
tomb
of
such
a
divine
personage
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
actual
dwelling
of
the
once
incarnate
god
even
though
his
bones
were
long
turned
to
dust
the
of
strengthens
this
suggestion
in
one
of
its
ancient
irish
poems
by
macnia
son
of
oenna
preceded
by
this
mystical
dedication

of

a
king
mansion
which
was
built
by
the
firm
daghda
it
was
a
wonder
a
court
an
admirable
hill
it
seems
clear
enough
from
the
old
irish
manuscripts
referred
to
by
coffey
that
the
boyne
country
near
tara
was
the
sacred
and
religious
centre
of
ancient
ireland
and
was
used
by
the
irish
in
very
much
the
same
way
as
memphis
and
other
places
on
the
sacred
nile
were
used
by
the
ancient
egyptians
both
as
a
royal
cemetery
and
as
a
place
for
the
celebration
of
pagan
mysteries
it
is
known
that
most
of
the
mysteries
of
antiquity
were
psychic
in
their
nature
having
to
do
with
the
neophyte
entrance
into
hades
or
the
invisible
world
while
out
of
the
physical
body
or
else
with
direct
communication
with
gods
spirits
and
shades
of
the
dead
while
in
the
physical
body
and
such
mysteries
were
performed
in
darkened
chambers
from
which
all
light
was
excluded
these
chambers
were
often
carved
out
of
solid
rock
as
can
be
seen
in
the
rock
temples
of
india
and
when
mountain
caves
or
natural
caverns
were
not
available
artificial
ones
were
used
see
chapter
x
the
places
like
tara
and
memphis
where
the
great
men
and
kings
of
the
nations
of
antiquity
were
entombed
being
the
most
sacred
were
very
often
on
that
account
also
the
places
dedicated
to
the
most
magnificent
temples
and
to
the
mysteries
or
among
less
advanced
nations
to
the
worship
of
the
dead
on
every
side
of
sacred
stonehenge
salisbury
plain
is
dotted
with
the
burial
mounds
of
unknown
heroes
and
chieftains
of
ancient
britain
while
in
modern
times
even
though
the
mysteries
are
long
forgotten
westminster
abbey
at
the
centre
of
the
planet
capital
has
in
turn
become
the
hallowed
hall
of
the
mighty
dead
for
the
vast
british
empire
in
view
of
all
these
facts
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
famous
new
grange
tumulus
itself
and
a
study
of
the
references
to
it
in
old
irish
literature
we
are
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
one
can
not
be
far
wrong
in
describing
it
as
a
in
which
were
celebrated
ancient
celtic
or
mysteries
at
the
time
when
neophytes
including
those
of
royal
blood
were
initiated
and
as
such
it
is
directly
related
to
a
cult
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
of
spirits
and
of
the
dead
nor
are
we
alone
in
this
opinion
coffey
himself
we
believe
is
inclined
to
favour
it
and
borlase
author
of
dolmens
of
who
is
quite
committed
to
it
says
that
it
is
not
necessary
as
some
do
to
consider
new
grange
as
an
ancient
abode
of
mortal
men
for
spirits
of
the
dead
the
fairies
the
might
have
had
their
or
palace
as
well
and
he
points
out
that
in
the
old
irish
manuscripts
we
have
proof
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
thus
used
this
proof
is
found
in
the
na
or
with
the
ancients
by
patrick
from
the
of
a
manuscript
copied
from
older
manuscripts
and
now
translated
by
standish
the
three
sons
of
the
king
of
ireland
by
name
ruidhe
fiacha
and
eochaid
leaving
their
nurse
and
guardian
house
went
to
na
of
the
wizards
of
tara
to
ask
of
their
father
a
country
a
domain
but
he
refused
their
request
and
then
they
formed
a
project
to
gain
lands
and
riches
by
fasting
on
the
dé
at
the
upon
the
boyne
lands
therefore
i
will
not
bestow
on
you
but
win
lands
for
yourself
thereupon
they
with
the
ready
rising
of
one
man
rose
and
took
their
way
to
the
green
of
the
upon
the
boyne
where
none
other
being
in
their
company
they
sat
them
down
ruidhe
said
what
is
your
plan
his
brothers
rejoined
our
project
is
to
fast
on
the
dé
aiming
thus
to
win
from
them
good
fortune
in
the
shape
of
a
country
of
a
domain
of
lands
and
to
have
vast
riches
nor
had
they
been
long
there
when
they
marked
a
young
man
of
a
pacific
demeanour
that
came
towards
them
he
salutes
the
king
of
ireland
sons
they
answer
him
after
the
same
manner
young
man
whence
art
thou
whence
comest
thou
out
of
yonder
chequered
with
the
many
lights
hard
by
you
here
what
name
wearest
thou
i
am
the
daghda
son
bodhb
derg
and
to
the
dé
it
was
revealed
that
ye
would
come
to
fast
here
for
lands
and
for
great
fortune
then
with
bodhb
derg
the
three
sons
of
ireland
king
entered
into
the
and
the
dé
went
into
council
and
midhir
son
of
the
daghda
who
presided
said
yonder
accommodate
now
with
three
wives
since
from
wives
it
is
that
either
fortune
or
misfortune
is
derived
and
from
their
marriages
with
the
three
daughters
of
midhir
they
derived
all
their
wishes
territories
and
wealth
in
the
greatest
abundance
three
days
with
their
nights
they
abode
in
the
told
them
to
carry
away
out
of
oakwood
three
one
in
full
bloom
another
shedding
the
blossom
and
another
covered
with
ripe
fruit
then
they
repaired
to
the
where
they
abode
for
three
times
fifty
years
and
until
those
kings
disappeared
for
in
virtue
of
marriage
alliance
they
returned
again
to
the
dé
and
from
that
time
forth
have
remained
there
borlase
commenting
on
this
passage
suggests
its
importance
in
proving
to
us
that
during
the
middle
ages
there
existed
a
tradition
thus
committed
to
writing
from
older
manuscripts
or
from
oral
sources
regarding
nature
of
the
rites
performed
in
pagan
times
at
those
places
which
were
held
sacred
to
the
heathen
mysteries
the
passage
evidently
describes
a
cult
of
royal
or
famous
ancestral
spirits
identified
with
the
of
tuatha
de
danann
who
as
we
know
being
reborn
as
mortals
ruled
ireland
these
ancestral
spirits
were
to
be
approached
by
a
pilgrimage
made
to
their
abode
the
tumulus
and
a
residence
in
it
of
three
days
and
three
nights
during
which
period
there
was
to
be
an
unbroken
fast
sacrifices
were
doubtless
offered
to
the
gods
or
and
while
they
were
upon
they
were
expected
to
appear
and
grant
the
pilgrim
prayer
and
to
speak
with
him
all
this
indicates
that
the
existence
of
invisible
beings
was
taken
for
granted
probably
through
the
knowledge
gained
by
initiation
the
or
the
of
nera
see
this
study
contains
a
description
like
the
one
above
of
how
a
mortal
named
nera
went
into
the
at
cruachan
and
it
is
said
that
he
went
not
only
into
the
cave
but
into
the
of
the
cave
the
term
or
cave
according
to
borlase
indicates
the
whole
of
the
interior
vaulted
chamber
while
the
of
that
vaulted
chamber
or
is
intended
to
refer
to
or
of
the
upon
entering
into
which
the
mortal
came
face
to
face
with
the
royal
occupants
and
there
doubtless
he
lay
fasting
or
offering
his
sacrifices
at
the
periods
prescribed
the
word
refers
simply
to
the
appearance
of
a
tumulus
or
souterrain
beneath
a
fort
or
rath
and
means
therefore
mansion
or
and
borlase
adds
feel
but
little
doubt
that
in
the
inner
chamber
at
new
grange
with
its
three
recesses
and
its
basin
we
have
this
of
the
and
the
place
where
the
pilgrims
fasted
a
situation
and
a
practice
precisely
similar
to
those
which
under
christian
auspices
were
continued
at
such
places
as
the
leaba
mologa
in
cork
the
original
patrick
purgatory
in
lough
derg
and
elsewhere
the
practice
of
lying
in
stone
troughs
was
a
feature
of
the
christian
pilgrimages
in
ireland
sometimes
such
troughs
had
served
the
previous
purpose
of
stone
coffins
it
is
just
possible
that
the
shallow
basins
in
the
cells
at
lough
crew
new
grange
and
dowth
may
like
the
stone
beds
or
troughs
of
the
saints
have
been
occupied
by
the
pilgrims
engaged
in
their
devotions
if
so
however
they
must
have
sat
in
them
in
eastern
fashion
again
in
the
popular
tale
called
pursuit
of
diarmuid
and
aengus
the
son
of
the
dagda
one
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
is
called
and
connected
with
the
in
the
tale
finn
says
us
leave
this
tulach
for
fear
that
and
the
might
catch
us
and
though
we
have
no
part
in
the
slaying
of
diarmuid
he
would
none
the
more
readily
believe
us
aengus
is
evidently
an
invisible
being
with
great
power
over
mortals
this
is
clear
in
what
follows
he
transports
diarmuid
body
to
the
saying
i
can
not
restore
him
to
life
i
will
send
a
soul
into
him
so
that
he
may
talk
to
me
each
day
thus
as
the
presiding
deity
of
the
aengus
the
tuatha
de
danann
could
reanimate
dead
bodies
cause
them
to
speak
to
devotees
we
may
suppose
oracularly
in
the
or
of
the
rowan
tree
a
fenian
tale
a
poet
put
finn
under
taboo
to
understand
these
verses
i
saw
a
house
in
the
country
out
of
which
no
hostages
are
given
to
a
king
fire
burns
it
not
harrying
spoils
it
not
and
finn
made
reply
understand
that
verse
for
that
is
the
brugh
of
the
boyne
that
you
have
seen
perhaps
as
we
suggest
during
an
initiation
namely
the
house
of
aengus
og
of
the
brugh
and
it
can
not
be
burned
or
harried
as
long
as
aengus
a
god
shall
live
as
borlase
observes
to
say
that
hostages
are
given
to
a
king
out
of
the
is
probably
another
way
of
saying
that
the
dead
pay
no
taxes
or
that
being
a
holy
place
the
was
exempt
this
last
evidence
is
from
oral
tradition
and
rather
late
in
being
placed
on
record
but
it
is
not
on
that
account
less
trustworthy
and
may
be
much
more
so
than
the
older
manuscripts
until
quite
modern
times
the
of
the
boyne
country
still
echoed
similar
traditions
about
unknown
mystic
rites
following
what
has
recorded
for
he
has
said
that
was
considered
the
presiding
fairy
of
the
boyne
till
quite
within
recent
times
and
that
his
name
was
still
familiar
to
the
old
inhabitants
of
meath
who
were
then
fast
forgetting
their
traditions
with
the
irish
language
and
this
tradition
brings
us
to
consider
what
was
apparently
an
aengus
cult
among
the
ancient
celtic
peoples
the
aengus
cult
euhemeristic
tradition
came
to
represent
the
great
god
dagda
and
his
sons
as
buried
in
a
tumulus
probably
new
grange
and
then
called
it
as
i
found
it
called
a
fairy
mound
a
name
given
also
to
gavrinis
its
breton
parallel
the
older
and
clearer
tradition
relates
how
aengus
gained
possession
of
the
of
the
boyne
and
says
nothing
about
it
as
a
cemetery
but
rather
describes
it
as
admirable
place
more
accurately
speaking
as
an
admirable
land
a
term
which
betrays
the
usual
identification
of
the
fairy
mound
with
the
nether
world
to
which
it
formed
the
entrance
the
myth
placing
dagda
at
the
head
of
the
departed
makes
him
goidelic
cronus
ruling
over
an
elysium
with
which
a
sepulchral
mound
was
associated
the
displacement
of
dagda
by
his
son
makes
oc
aengus
who
should
have
been
the
youthful
zeus
of
the
goidelic
world
rejoicing
in
the
translucent
expanse
of
the
heavens
as
his
crystal
bower
a
king
of
the
dead
in
dun
aengus
the
strange
cyclopean
circular
structure
and
hence
most
likely
on
aranmore
we
have
another
example
of
the
localization
of
the
aengus
myth
this
fact
leads
us
to
believe
after
due
archaeological
examination
that
amid
the
stronghold
of
dun
aengus
with
its
tiers
of
seats
and
the
native
rock
at
its
centre
apparently
squared
to
form
a
platform
or
stage
were
anciently
celebrated
pagan
mysteries
comparable
to
those
of
the
greeks
and
less
cultured
peoples
and
initiations
into
an
aengus
cult
such
as
seems
to
have
once
flourished
at
new
grange
at
dun
aengus
however
the
mystic
assemblies
and
rites
conducted
in
such
a
so
secure
and
so
strongly
fortified
against
intrusion
no
doubt
represented
a
somewhat
different
mystical
school
and
probably
one
very
much
older
than
at
new
grange
in
the
same
manner
each
of
the
other
circular
but
less
important
cyclopean
structures
on
aranmore
and
elsewhere
in
west
ireland
may
have
been
structures
for
closely
related
to
our
mind
and
we
have
carefully
and
at
leisure
examined
most
of
these
cyclopean
structures
on
aranmore
it
seems
altogether
fanciful
to
consider
them
as
having
been
and
intended
as
places
of
refuge
or
forts
yet
because
the
ancient
celts
never
separated
civil
and
religious
functions
such
probable
could
have
been
as
frequently
used
for
tribal
assemblies
as
for
initiation
ceremonies
and
nothing
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
have
been
in
times
of
need
also
places
for
refuge
against
enemies
we
are
led
to
this
view
with
respect
to
dun
aengus
in
particular
because
the
aengus
of
aranmore
is
known
as
aengus
son
of
umór
and
is
associated
with
the
mystic
people
called
the
fir
bolg
and
yet
as
sir
john
rhŷs
thinks
this
aengus
son
of
umór
and
aengus
son
of
dagda
are
two
aspects
of
a
single
god
a
celtic
zeus
statements
about
dun
aengus
seem
to
confirm
all
this
and
there
seems
to
have
been
a
tale
now
lost
about
the
of
in
modern
irish
the
fortress
of
aengus
this
represented
in
ireland
by
the
aengus
cult
can
be
traced
further
sir
john
rhŷs
regards
stonehenge
a
also
circular
like
the
irish
and
breton
cromlechs
as
a
temple
to
the
celtic
zeus
in
irish
mythology
typified
by
aengus
and
in
welsh
by
merlin
sort
of
a
temple
could
have
been
more
appropriate
for
the
primary
god
of
light
and
of
the
luminous
heavens
than
a
spacious
enclosure
of
a
circular
form
like
stonehenge
in
welsh
myth
math
ab
mathonwy
called
also
the
ancient
was
the
greatest
magician
of
ancient
wales
and
his
relation
as
teacher
to
gwydion
ab
dôn
the
great
welsh
culture
hero
leads
sir
john
rhŷs
to
consider
him
the
brythonic
zeus
though
merlin
shares
with
him
in
this
distinction
and
since
the
gaelic
counterpart
of
math
is
aengus
a
close
study
of
math
might
finally
show
a
cult
in
his
honour
in
wales
as
we
have
found
in
ireland
an
aengus
cult
we
may
therefore
with
more
or
less
exactness
equate
the
aengus
cult
as
we
see
it
in
irish
myth
connected
chiefly
with
dun
aengus
and
new
grange
with
the
unknown
cult
practised
at
stonehenge
and
this
in
turn
with
other
brythonic
or
and
initiations
practised
at
carnac
the
great
celtic
jerusalem
in
brittany
and
at
gavrinis
all
this
will
be
more
clearly
seen
after
we
have
set
forth
what
seems
a
definite
and
most
striking
parallel
to
new
grange
both
as
a
monument
erected
by
man
and
as
we
maintain
as
a
place
for
religious
mysteries
the
greatest
structure
ever
raised
by
human
effort
the
great
pyramid
new
grange
and
the
great
pyramid
compared
caliph
al
mamoun
in
by
a
forced
passage
was
the
first
in
modern
times
to
enter
the
great
pyramid
and
he
found
nowhere
a
mummy
or
any
indications
that
the
structure
had
ever
been
used
as
a
tomb
for
the
dead
the
king
chamber
so
named
by
us
moderns
proved
to
be
a
keen
disappointment
for
its
first
violator
for
in
it
there
was
neither
gold
nor
silver
nor
anything
at
all
worth
carrying
away
the
magnificent
chamber
contained
nothing
save
an
empty
stone
chest
without
a
lid
archaeologists
in
egypt
and
archaeologists
in
ireland
face
the
same
unsolved
problem
namely
the
purpose
of
the
empty
stone
chest
without
inscriptions
and
quite
unlike
a
mummy
tomb
and
of
the
stone
basin
in
new
grange
certain
egyptologists
have
supposed
that
some
royal
personage
must
have
been
buried
in
the
curious
granite
coffer
though
there
can
be
only
their
supposition
to
support
them
for
they
have
absolutely
no
proof
that
such
is
true
while
there
is
strong
circumstantial
evidence
to
show
that
such
is
not
true
sir
gardner
wilkinson
in
his
publications
has
already
suggested
that
the
stone
chest
as
well
as
the
great
pyramid
itself
were
never
intended
to
hold
a
corpse
and
it
is
generally
admitted
by
egyptologists
that
no
sarcophagus
intended
for
a
mummy
has
ever
been
found
so
high
up
in
the
body
of
a
pyramid
as
this
empty
stone
chest
except
in
the
second
pyramid
incontestable
evidence
in
support
of
the
highly
probable
theory
that
the
great
pyramid
was
not
intended
for
an
actual
tomb
can
be
drawn
from
two
important
facts
coffer
has
certain
remarkable
cubic
proportions
which
show
a
care
and
design
beyond
what
could
be
expected
in
any
according
to
the
high
authority
of
flinders
petrie
the
chamber
containing
the
coffer
and
the
upper
have
ventilating
channels
not
known
in
any
other
pyramid
so
that
apparently
there
must
have
been
need
of
frequent
entrance
into
the
chamber
by
living
men
as
would
be
the
case
if
used
as
we
hold
for
initiation
ceremonies
it
is
well
known
that
very
many
of
the
megalithic
monuments
of
the
new
grange
type
scattered
over
europe
especially
from
the
carnac
centre
of
brittany
to
the
centre
of
ireland
have
one
thing
in
common
an
astronomical
arrangement
like
the
great
pyramid
and
an
entrance
facing
one
of
the
points
of
the
solstices
usually
either
the
winter
solstice
which
is
common
or
the
summer
solstice
the
puzzle
has
always
been
to
discover
the
exact
arrangement
of
the
great
pyramid
by
locating
its
main
entrance
a
californian
louis
mccarty
in
his
recent
work
entitled
great
pyramid
suggests
with
the
most
logical
and
reasonable
arguments
that
the
builders
of
the
pyramid
have
placed
its
main
entrance
in
an
undiscovered
beneath
the
great
sphinx
now
in
the
shifting
desert
sands
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
sphinx
is
the
real
portal
and
many
things
tend
to
indicate
that
it
is
the
great
pyramid
is
built
on
the
same
plan
as
new
grange
that
is
to
say
it
opens
to
the
and
like
new
grange
contains
a
narrow
leading
to
a
central
chamber
from
the
centre
of
the
pyramid
lies
the
sphinx
feet
away
a
distance
equal
to
five
times
the
distance
of
the
diagonal
socket
length
of
the
great
pyramid
from
the
centre
of
the
subterranean
chamber
under
the
pyramid
to
the
supposed
entrance
under
the
sphinx
a
distance
quite
in
keeping
with
the
mighty
proportions
of
the
wonderful
structure
and
what
is
important
several
eminent
archaeologists
have
worked
out
the
same
conclusion
and
have
been
seeking
to
connect
the
two
monuments
by
making
excavations
in
the
queen
chamber
where
it
is
supposed
there
exists
a
tunnel
to
the
sphinx
in
all
this
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
present
entrance
to
the
pyramid
is
the
forced
one
made
by
the
caliph
this
very
probable
astronomical
parallelism
between
the
great
egyptian
monument
and
the
irish
one
would
establish
their
common
religious
or
in
a
mystic
sense
their
funereal
significance
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
have
set
forth
what
symbolical
relation
the
sun
its
rising
and
setting
and
its
death
at
the
winter
equinox
were
anciently
supposed
to
hold
to
the
doctrines
of
human
death
and
jubainville
regarding
the
sun
among
the
celts
in
its
symbolical
relation
to
death
wrote
celtic
belief
the
dead
go
to
live
beyond
the
ocean
to
the
there
where
the
sun
sets
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
this
too
as
maspero
shows
was
an
egyptian
belief
while
as
equally
among
the
celts
the
east
especially
the
where
after
the
winter
solstice
the
sun
seems
to
be
or
to
rise
out
of
the
underworld
of
hades
into
which
it
goes
when
it
dies
is
symbolical
of
the
reverse
life
resurrection
and
in
this
last
belief
we
maintain
may
be
found
the
reason
why
the
chief
megalithic
monuments
dolmens
tumuli
and
alignements
in
celtic
countries
and
elsewhere
have
their
directions
east
and
west
and
why
those
like
new
grange
and
gavrinis
open
to
the
sunrise
greek
temples
also
opened
to
the
sunrise
and
on
the
divine
image
within
fell
the
first
rays
of
the
beautiful
god
apollo
in
the
great
peruvian
at
cuzco
a
splendid
disk
of
pure
gold
faced
the
east
and
reflecting
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
illuminated
the
whole
sanctuary
the
of
the
florida
red
men
opened
eastward
and
within
its
entrance
on
festival
days
stood
the
priest
at
dawn
watching
for
the
first
ray
of
the
sun
as
a
sign
to
begin
the
chant
and
offering
the
east
indian
performs
the
ablution
at
dawn
in
the
sacred
ganges
and
stands
facing
the
east
meditating
as
brahma
appears
in
all
the
wondrous
glory
of
a
tropical
sunrise
and
in
the
same
aryan
land
there
is
an
opposite
worship
the
dreaded
thugs
worshippers
of
devils
and
of
kali
the
in
their
most
diabolical
rites
face
the
west
and
the
sunset
symbols
of
death
how
christianity
was
shaped
by
paganism
is
nowhere
clearer
than
in
the
orientation
of
great
cathedral
churches
almost
without
exception
in
england
for
all
of
the
more
famous
ones
have
their
altars
eastward
and
roman
catholics
in
prayer
in
their
church
services
and
anglicans
in
repeating
the
creed
turn
to
the
east
as
the
hindu
does
augustine
says
we
stand
at
prayer
we
turn
to
the
east
where
the
heaven
arises
not
as
though
god
were
only
there
and
had
forsaken
all
other
parts
of
the
world
but
to
admonish
our
mind
to
turn
to
a
more
excellent
nature
that
is
to
the
lord
though
the
jews
came
to
be
utterly
opposed
to
in
their
later
history
they
were
at
first
as
their
temples
opening
eastward
testify
this
was
the
vision
of
ezekiel
behold
at
the
door
of
the
temple
of
jehovah
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
were
about
five
and
twenty
men
with
their
backs
toward
the
temple
of
jehovah
and
their
faces
toward
the
east
and
they
worshipped
the
sun
toward
the
east
all
this
illustrates
the
once
religion
of
our
race
and
shows
that
and
are
derived
from
a
universal
doctrine
regarding
the
two
states
of
existence
the
one
in
hades
or
the
invisible
lower
world
where
the
goes
at
night
and
the
other
in
what
we
call
the
visible
realm
which
the
visits
daily
the
relation
between
life
and
death
symbolically
figured
in
this
fundamental
conception
forming
the
background
of
every
is
the
foundation
of
all
ancient
mysteries
thus
we
should
expect
the
correspondences
which
we
believe
do
exist
between
new
grange
and
the
great
pyramid
both
alike
in
our
opinion
were
the
greatest
places
in
the
respective
countries
for
the
celebration
of
the
mysteries
high
up
in
the
body
of
the
great
pyramid
after
he
had
performed
the
long
underground
journey
typical
of
the
journey
of
osiris
or
the
sun
to
the
otherworld
or
the
world
of
the
dead
we
may
suppose
knowing
what
we
do
of
the
ancient
mysteries
and
their
shadows
in
modern
masonic
initiations
that
the
royal
or
priestly
neophyte
laid
himself
in
that
strange
stone
coffin
without
a
lid
for
a
certain
period
of
time
probably
for
three
days
and
three
nights
then
the
initiation
being
complete
he
arose
from
the
mystic
death
to
a
real
resurrection
a
true
child
of
osiris
in
new
grange
we
may
suppose
that
the
royal
or
priestly
neophyte
while
he
on
the
tuatha
de
danann
for
three
days
with
their
nights
sat
in
that
strange
stone
basin
after
the
manner
of
the
orient
the
great
pyramid
seems
to
be
the
most
ancient
of
the
egyptian
pyramids
and
undoubtedly
was
the
model
for
all
the
smaller
ones
which
betray
profound
ignorance
of
their
noble
model
chiefest
internal
features
as
well
as
of
all
its
niceties
of
angle
and
cosmic
harmonies
of
linear
measurement
flinders
petrie
says
great
pyramid
at
gizeh
of
khufu
fourth
dynasty
unquestionably
takes
the
lead
in
accuracy
and
in
beauty
of
work
as
well
as
in
size
not
only
is
the
fine
work
of
it
in
the
pavement
casing
king
and
queen
chambers
quite
unexcelled
but
the
general
character
of
the
core
masonry
is
better
than
that
of
any
other
pyramid
in
its
solidity
and
regularity
and
of
the
stone
coffers
he
says
most
of
its
dimensions
at
their
maximum
they
agree
closely
with
the
same
theory
as
that
which
is
applicable
to
the
chambers
for
when
squared
they
are
all
even
multiples
of
a
square
fifth
of
a
cubit
there
is
no
other
theory
applicable
to
every
lineal
dimension
of
the
coffer
but
having
found
the
π
proportion
in
the
form
of
the
pyramid
and
in
the
king
chamber
there
is
some
ground
for
supposing
that
it
was
intended
also
in
the
coffer
on
just
the
scale
of
the
chamber
and
here
is
apparent
the
important
fact
we
wish
to
emphasize
the
great
pyramid
does
not
seem
to
have
been
intended
primarily
if
at
all
for
the
entombment
of
dead
bodies
or
mummies
while
numerous
were
sepulchral
purposes
without
doubt
there
appears
to
have
been
at
first
a
clear
understanding
of
the
esoteric
usage
of
the
great
pyramid
as
a
place
for
the
mystic
burial
of
initiates
and
then
in
the
course
of
national
decadence
the
exoteric
interpretation
of
this
usage
the
interpretation
now
popular
with
egyptologists
led
to
the
erection
of
smaller
pyramids
for
purposes
of
actual
burial
and
may
we
not
see
in
such
tumuli
as
those
of
mont
michel
gavrinis
and
new
grange
copies
of
these
smaller
funeral
pyramids
or
if
not
direct
copies
at
least
the
result
of
a
similar
religious
decadence
from
the
unknown
centuries
since
the
great
pyramid
was
erected
by
the
divine
kings
of
prehistoric
egypt
as
a
silent
witness
for
all
ages
that
great
men
initiates
have
understood
universal
law
and
have
solved
the
greatest
of
all
human
problems
the
problem
of
life
and
death
gavrinis
and
new
grange
compared
in
conclusion
and
in
support
of
the
arguments
already
advanced
i
offer
a
few
observations
of
my
own
made
at
gavrinis
itself
the
most
famous
tumulus
in
continental
europe
after
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
interior
and
exterior
of
the
tumulus
an
examination
extending
over
more
than
twelve
hours
i
am
convinced
that
its
curious
and
those
in
new
grange
are
by
the
same
race
of
people
whoever
that
race
may
have
been
and
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
its
construction
to
show
that
like
new
grange
it
was
quite
as
religious
as
funereal
in
its
nature
and
use
the
facts
which
bear
out
this
view
are
the
following
first
there
are
three
strange
cavities
cut
into
the
body
of
the
stone
on
the
south
side
of
the
inner
chamber
communicating
interiorly
with
one
another
and
large
enough
to
admit
human
hands
if
used
as
places
in
which
to
offer
sacrifice
to
the
dead
or
fairies
small
objects
could
have
been
placed
in
them
in
the
oldest
extant
authentic
records
of
them
which
i
have
found
it
is
said
of
their
probable
purpose
people
look
on
them
as
a
double
noose
intended
to
strangle
the
animal
victims
which
the
priest
sacrificed
for
others
they
are
two
rings
behind
which
the
hands
of
the
betrothed
met
each
other
to
be
married
their
purpose
is
certainly
difficult
enough
to
decipher
perhaps
is
undecipherable
but
one
thing
about
them
is
certain
namely
that
a
close
examination
round
their
exterior
edges
and
within
them
also
shows
the
worn
smooth
as
though
by
ages
of
handling
and
touching
and
it
is
incontestable
that
this
wearing
of
the
by
human
hands
could
not
have
taken
place
had
the
inner
chamber
been
sealed
up
and
used
solely
as
a
tomb
we
suggest
here
as
sir
james
fergusson
in
his
stone
has
suggested
that
the
inner
chamber
of
gavrinis
was
probably
a
place
for
the
celebration
of
religious
rites
he
advances
the
opinion
that
the
strange
cavities
were
used
to
contain
holy
oil
or
holy
water
there
is
this
second
curious
fact
connected
with
the
tumulus
of
gavrinis
on
entering
it
and
it
opens
like
new
grange
to
the
sunrise
being
oriented
to
the
one
finds
placed
across
the
floor
of
the
narrow
as
slightly
inclined
steps
rising
to
the
inner
chamber
three
or
four
stones
two
of
them
now
very
prominent
form
veritable
and
the
one
at
the
threshold
of
the
inner
chamber
is
carved
quite
like
the
lintel
stone
above
the
entrance
at
new
grange
from
what
we
know
of
ancient
mystic
cults
there
was
a
darkened
chamber
approached
by
a
narrow
so
low
that
the
neophyte
must
stoop
in
traversing
it
to
show
symbolically
his
humility
and
as
symbolic
of
his
progress
to
the
chamber
of
death
the
of
the
there
were
steps
often
purposely
placed
as
the
great
pyramid
evidently
conforms
to
this
mystical
plan
and
strikes
one
therefore
all
the
more
forcibly
as
the
most
remarkable
structure
for
initiatory
ceremonies
ever
constructed
on
our
planet
thus
flinders
petrie
says
we
are
met
then
by
an
extraordinary
idea
that
all
access
to
the
king
chamber
after
its
completion
must
have
been
by
climbing
over
the
as
they
lay
in
the
gallery
or
by
walking
up
the
ramps
on
either
side
of
them
yet
as
the
blocks
can
not
physically
have
been
lying
in
any
other
place
before
they
were
let
down
we
are
shut
up
to
this
view
and
as
egyptian
tombs
represented
the
mansions
of
the
dead
just
so
celtic
or
and
place
for
initiations
were
always
connected
with
the
underworld
of
the
dead
and
save
for
such
symbolical
arrangements
as
we
see
in
gavrinis
and
new
grange
also
they
were
undistinguishable
from
tombs
used
for
interments
only
it
seems
to
us
most
reasonable
to
suppose
that
if
as
the
old
irish
manuscripts
show
there
were
or
places
for
pagan
funeral
rites
or
rites
of
initiation
in
ireland
constructed
like
other
tumuli
which
were
used
only
as
tombs
for
the
dead
because
the
ancient
cult
was
one
of
ancestor
worship
and
worship
of
gods
like
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
spirits
then
there
must
have
been
others
in
brittany
also
where
we
find
the
same
system
of
further
in
view
of
all
the
definite
provable
relations
between
gavrinis
and
new
grange
we
are
strongly
inclined
to
regard
them
both
as
having
the
same
origin
and
purpose
gavrinis
being
for
armorica
what
new
grange
was
for
ireland

the
testimony
of

of

of

and
of

is
to
be
explained
by
that
primitive
naturalism
which
all
the

held

united
to
proscribe

psychological
theory

so
vast
that
we
can
not
do
more
than
point
to
portions
of
it
especially
such
portions
as
are
most
celtic
in
their
nature
perhaps
most
of
us
will
think
first
of
all
about
the
ancient
cults
rendered
to
fountains
rivers
lakes
trees
and
as
we
have
seen
pp
ff
to
stones
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
these
cults
were
very
flourishing
when
christianity
came
to
europe
for
kings
popes
and
church
councils
issued
edict
after

condemning
them

of

infidels

he

he
must
know
that
he
is
guilty
of
sacrilege

canute
in
england
and
charlemagne
in
europe
conducted
a
most
vigorous
campaign
against
all
these
pagan
worships
this
is
charlemagne
edict
respect
to
trees
stones
and
fountains
where
certain
foolish
people
light
torches
or
practise
other
superstitions
we
earnestly
ordain
that
that
most
evil
custom
detestable
to
god
wherever
it
be
found
should
be
removed
and
destroyed
the
result
of
these
edicts
was
a
curious
one
it
was
too
much
to
expect
the
eradication
of
the
old
cults
after
their
existence
and
so
one
by
one
they
were
absorbed
by
the
new
religion
in
a
sacred
tree
or
grove
over
a
holy
well
or
fountain
on
the
shore
of
a
lake
or
river
there
was
placed
an
image
of
the
virgin
or
of
some
saint
and
unconsciously
the
transformation
was
made
as
the
beheld
in
the
brilliant
images
new
and
more
glorious
for
the
spirits
they
and
their
fathers
had
so
long
venerated
the
cult
of
sacred
waters
in
brittany
perhaps
better
than
in
other
celtic
countries
one
can
readily
discern
this
evolution
from
paganism
to
christianity
thus
for
example
in
the
morbihan
there
is
the
fountain
of
anne
round
which
centres
brittany
most
important
pardon
a
fountain
near
vannes
is
dedicated
to
peter
at
carnac
there
is
the
fountain
of
cornely
with
its
niche
containing
an
image
of
patron
saint
and
not
far
from
it
on
the
roadside
leading
to
carnac
plage
an
enclosed
well
dedicated
to
the
holy
virgin
and
less
than
a
mile
away
the
beautiful
fountain
of
columba
near
ploermel
canton
of
ploermel
morbihan
there
is
the
fountain
of
recourrance
or
laurent
in
which
sailors
perform
divinations
to
know
the
future
state
of
the
weather
by
casting
on
its
waters
a
morsel
of
bread
if
the
bread
floats
it
is
a
sure
sign
of
fair
weather
but
if
it
sinks
of
weather
so
bad
that
no
one
should
take
risks
by
going
out
in
the
in
some
wells
pins
are
dropped
by
lovers
if
the
pins
float
the
show
favourable
auspices
but
if
the
pins
sink
the
maiden
is
unhappy
and
will
hesitate
in
accepting
the
proposal
of
marriage
long
after
their
conversion
the
inhabitants
of
concoret
arrondissement
de
ploermel
morbihan
paid
divine
honours
to
the
fountain
of
baranton
in
the
druidical
forest
of
brocéliande
so
famous
in
the
breton
legends
of
arthur
and
merlin
a
long
time
the
inhabitants
of
concoret
in
place
of
addressing
themselves
to
god
or
to
his
saints
in
their
maladies
sought
the
remedy
in
the
fountain
of
baranton
either
by
praying
to
it
after
the
manner
of
the
gauls
or
by
drinking
of
its
waters
in
the
month
of
august
when
there
was
an
unusual
drought
in
the
land
all
the
inhabitants
of
concoret
formed
in
a
great
procession
with
banners
and
crucifix
at
their
head
and
with
chants
and
ringing
of
church
bells
marched
to
this
same
fountain
of
baranton
and
prayed
for
rain
this
curious
bit
of
history
was
also
reported
to
me
in
july
by
a
peasant
who
lives
near
the
fountain
and
who
heard
it
from
his
parents
and
he
added
that
the
foot
of
the
crucifix
was
planted
in
the
water
to
aid
the
we
have
here
an
interesting
combination
of
paganism
and
christianity
gregory
of
tours
says
that
the
of
gévaudan
rendered
divine
honours
to
a
certain
lake
and
as
offerings
cast
on
its
waters
linen
wool
cheese
bread
and
other
things
and
mahé
adds
that
gold
was
sometimes
offered
quite
after
the
manner
of
the
ancient
peruvians
who
cast
gold
and
silver
of
great
value
into
the
waters
of
sacred
lake
titicaca
high
up
in
the
andes
to
absorb
into
christianity
the
worship
paid
to
the
lake
near
gévaudan
the
bishop
ordered
a
church
to
be
built
on
its
shore
and
to
the
people
he
said
children
there
is
nothing
divine
in
this
lake
defile
not
your
souls
by
these
vain
ceremonies
but
recognize
rather
the
true
god
the
offerings
to
the
then
ceased
and
were
made
instead
on
the
altar
of
the
church
as
canon
mahé
so
consistently
sets
forth
other
similar
means
were
used
to
absorb
the
pagan
cults
of
sacred
waters
pastors
employed
a
similar
device
to
absorb
the
cult
of
fountains
into
christianity
they
consecrated
them
to
god
under
the
invocation
of
certain
saints
giving
the
saints
names
to
them
and
placing
in
them
the
saints
images
so
that
the
weak
and
christians
who
might
come
to
them
struck
by
these
names
and
by
these
images
should
grow
accustomed
to
addressing
their
prayers
to
god
and
to
his
saints
in
place
of
honouring
the
fountains
themselves
as
they
had
been
accustomed
to
do
this
is
the
reason
why
there
are
seen
in
the
stonework
of
so
many
fountains
niches
and
little
statues
of
saints
who
have
given
their
names
to
these
springs
procopius
reports
that
the
franks
even
after
having
accepted
christianity
remained
attached
to
their
ancient
cults
sacrificing
to
the
river
po
women
and
children
of
the
goths
and
casting
the
bodies
into
its
waters
to
the
spirits
of
the
waters
in
the
isle
of
man
not
yet
quite
extinct
was
no
doubt
once
very
general
as
moore
has
shown
the
sacred
wells
in
the
isle
of
man
were
visited
and
offerings
made
to
them
to
secure
immunity
from
witches
and
fairies
to
cure
maladies
to
raise
a
wind
and
for
various
kinds
of
divination
and
no
doubt
the
offerings
of
rags
on
bushes
over
sacred
wells
and
the
casting
of
pins
coins
buttons
pebbles
and
other
small
objects
into
their
waters
a
common
practice
yet
in
ireland
and
wales
as
in
countries
are
to
be
referred
to
as
survivals
of
a
time
when
regular
sacrifices
were
offered
in
divination
or
in
seeking
cures
from
maladies
and
equally
from
obsessing
demons
who
were
thought
to
cause
the
maladies
in
the
prologue
to
chrétien
du
there
is
an
account
seemingly
very
ancient
of
how
dishonour
to
the
divinities
of
wells
and
springs
brought
destruction
on
the
rich
land
of
logres
the
damsels
who
abode
in
these
watery
places
fed
travellers
with
nourishing
food
until
king
amangons
wronged
one
of
them
by
carrying
off
her
golden
cup
his
men
followed
his
evil
example
so
that
the
springs
dried
up
the
grass
withered
and
the
land
became
waste
according
to
borlase
was
by
passing
under
the
waters
of
a
well
that
the
that
is
the
abode
of
the
spirits
called
in
the
tumulus
or
natural
hill
as
the
case
might
be
was
reached
and
it
is
evident
from
this
that
the
were
even
identified
in
ireland
with
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
i
am
reminded
of
a
walk
i
was
privileged
to
take
with
william
yeats
on
lady
gregory
estate
at
coole
park
near
gort
county
galway
for
yeats
led
me
to
the
haunts
of
the
of
the
region
along
a
strange
river
which
flows
underground
for
some
distance
and
then
comes
out
to
the
light
again
in
its
weird
course
and
to
a
dark
deep
pool
hidden
in
the
forest
according
to
tradition
the
river
is
the
abode
of
and
in
the
shaded
whose
depth
is
very
great
live
a
like
the
greek
nymphs
more
than
one
mortal
while
looking
into
this
pool
has
felt
a
sudden
and
powerful
impulse
to
plunge
in
for
the
fairies
were
then
casting
their
magic
spell
over
him
that
they
might
take
him
to
live
in
their
palace
for
ever
one
of
the
most
beautiful
passages
in
tripartite
life
of
describes
the
holy
man
at
the
holy
well
called
cliabach
patrick
went
at
sunrise
to
the
well
namely
cliabach
on
the
sides
of
cruachan
the
clerics
sat
down
by
the
well
two
daughters
of
loegaire
son
of
niall
went
early
to
the
well
to
wash
their
hands
as
was
a
custom
of
theirs
namely
ethne
the
fair
and
fedelm
the
ruddy
the
maidens
found
beside
the
well
the
assembly
of
the
clerics
in
white
garments
with
their
books
before
them
and
they
wondered
at
the
shape
of
the
clerics
and
thought
that
they
were
men
of
the
elves
or
apparitions
they
asked
tidings
of
patrick
whence
are
ye
and
whence
have
ye
come
are
ye
of
the
elves
or
of
the
gods
and
patrick
said
to
them
it
were
better
for
you
to
believe
in
god
than
to
inquire
about
our
race
said
the
girl
who
was
elder
who
is
your
god
and
where
is
he
is
he
in
heaven
or
in
earth
or
under
earth
or
on
earth
is
he
in
seas
or
in
streams
or
in
mountains
or
in
glens
hath
he
sons
and
daughters
is
there
gold
and
silver
is
there
abundance
of
every
good
thing
in
his
kingdom
tell
us
about
him
how
he
is
seen
how
he
is
loved
how
he
is
found
if
he
is
in
youth
or
if
he
is
in
age
if
he
is
if
he
is
beautiful
if
many
have
fostered
his
son
if
his
daughters
are
dear
and
beautiful
to
the
men
of
the
world
and
in
another
place
it
is
recorded
that
went
to
the
well
of
findmag
slán
is
its
name
they
told
patrick
that
the
heathen
honoured
the
well
as
if
it
were
a
god
and
of
the
same
well
it
is
said
the
magi
wizards
or
druids
used
to
reverence
the
well
slán
and
offer
gifts
to
it
as
if
it
were
a
god
as
whitley
stokes
pointed
out
this
is
the
only
passage
connecting
the
druids
with
and
it
is
very
important
because
it
establishes
the
relation
between
the
druids
as
magicians
and
their
control
of
spirits
like
fairies
as
shown
here
and
as
seems
evident
in
relation
with
druids
and
exorcism
in
adamnan
of
the
early
celtic
peoples
undoubtedly
drew
many
of
their
from
a
memory
of
druidic
rites
of
divination
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
description
of
a
holy
well
and
a
description
illustrative
of
such
divination
is
that
of
ireland
most
mystical
well
connla
well
daughter
of
lodan
lucharglan
son
of
ler
out
of
tír
tairngire
land
of
promise
fairyland
went
to
connla
well
which
is
under
sea
to
behold
it
that
is
a
well
at
which
are
the
hazels
and
inspirations
of
wisdom
that
is
the
hazels
of
the
science
of
poetry
and
in
the
same
hour
their
fruit
and
their
blossom
and
their
foliage
break
forth
and
these
fall
on
the
well
in
the
same
shower
which
raises
on
the
water
a
royal
surge
of
purple
then
the
sacred
salmon
chew
the
fruit
and
the
juice
of
the
nuts
is
apparent
on
their
purple
bellies
and
seven
streams
of
wisdom
spring
forth
and
turn
there
again
to
these
cults
of
sacred
waters
numerous
parallels
could
easily
be
offered
but
they
seem
unnecessary
with
celtic
evidence
so
clear
and
this
evidence
which
is
already
set
forth
shows
that
the
origin
of
worship
paid
to
sacred
wells
fountains
lakes
or
rivers
is
to
be
found
in
the
religious
practices
of
the
celts
before
they
became
christianized
they
believed
that
certain
orders
of
spirits
often
called
fairies
and
to
be
identified
with
them
inhabited
or
as
was
the
case
with
sinend
who
came
from
the
otherworld
visited
these
places
and
must
be
appeased
or
approached
through
sacrifice
by
mortals
seeking
their
favours
canon
mahé
puts
the
matter
thus
celts
recognized
a
supreme
god
the
principle
of
all
things
but
they
rendered
religious
worship
to
the
genii
or
secondary
deities
who
according
to
them
united
themselves
to
different
objects
in
nature
and
made
them
divine
by
such
union
among
the
objects
were
rivers
the
sea
lakes
and
fountains
the
cult
of
sacred
trees
the
things
said
of
sacred
waters
can
also
be
said
of
sacred
trees
among
the
celts
and
in
the
case
of
sacred
trees
more
may
be
added
about
the
druids
and
their
relation
to
the
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
druids
held
the
oak
and
its
mistletoe
in
great
religious
veneration
and
it
is
generally
thought
that
most
of
the
famous
druid
schools
were
in
the
midst
of
sacred
or
forests
pliny
has
recorded
that
druids
for
so
they
call
their
magicians
have
nothing
which
they
hold
more
sacred
than
the
mistletoe
and
the
tree
on
which
it
grows
provided
only
it
be
an
oak
but
apart
from
that
they
select
groves
of
oak
and
they
perform
no
sacred
rite
without
leaves
from
that
tree
so
that
the
druids
may
be
regarded
as
even
deriving
from
it
their
name
interpreted
as
greek
a
disputed
point
among
modern
philologists
likewise
of
the
druids
maximus
tyrius
states
that
the
image
of
their
chief
god
considered
by
him
to
correspond
to
zeus
was
a
lofty
oak
tree
and
strabo
says
that
the
principal
place
of
assembly
for
the
galatians
a
celtic
people
of
asia
minor
was
the
sacred
just
as
the
cult
of
fountains
was
absorbed
by
christianity
so
was
the
cult
of
trees
concerning
this
canon
mahé
writes
sees
sometimes
in
the
country
and
in
gardens
trees
wherein
by
trimming
and
bending
together
the
branches
have
been
formed
niches
of
verdure
in
which
have
been
placed
crosses
or
images
of
certain
saints
this
usage
is
not
confined
to
the
morbihan
our
lady
of
the
oak
in
anjou
and
our
lady
of
the
oak
near
orthe
in
maine
are
places
famous
for
pilgrimage
in
this
last
province
says
a
historian
one
sees
at
various
the
most
beautiful
rustic
oaks
decorated
with
figures
of
saints
there
are
seen
there
in
five
or
six
villages
chapels
of
oaks
with
whole
trunks
of
that
tree
enshrined
in
the
wall
beside
the
altar
such
among
others
is
that
famous
chapel
of
our
lady
of
the
oak
near
the
forge
of
orthe
whose
celebrity
attracts
daily
from
five
to
six
leagues
about
a
very
great
gathering
of
people
saint
martin
according
to
canon
mahé
tried
to
destroy
a
sacred
in
the
diocese
of
tours
by
telling
the
people
there
was
nothing
divine
in
it
the
people
agreed
to
let
it
be
cut
down
on
condition
that
the
saint
should
receive
its
great
trunk
on
his
head
as
it
fell
and
the
tree
was
not
cut
down
saint

caused
a
great
scandal
at

to
abolish
among

of

to
certain
trees
in
ireland
fairy
trees
are
common
yet
though
throughout
celtdom
sacred
trees
naturally
of
short
duration
are
almost
forgotten
in
brittany
the
forest
of
brocéliande
still
enjoys
something
of
the
old
veneration
but
more
out
of
sentiment
than
by
actual
worship
a
curious
survival
of
an
ancient
celtic
exists
in
carmarthen
wales
where
there
is
still
carefully
preserved
and
held
upright
in
a
firm
casing
of
cement
the
decaying
trunk
of
an
old
called
merlin
oak
and
local
prophecy
declares
on
merlin
authority
that
when
the
tree
falls
carmarthen
will
fall
with
it
perhaps
through
an
unconscious
desire
on
the
part
of
some
patriotic
citizens
of
averting
the
calamity
by
inducing
the
to
transfer
its
abode
or
else
by
otherwise
hoodwinking
the
into
forgetting
that
merlin
oak
is
dead
a
vigorous
and
now
flourishing
young
oak
has
been
planted
so
directly
beside
it
that
its
foliage
embraces
it
and
in
many
parts
of
modern
england
the
a
man
entirely
hidden
in
a
covering
of
green
foliage
who
dances
through
the
streets
on
may
day
may
be
another
example
of
a
very
ancient
tree
or
else
agricultural
cult
of
celtic
origin
the
cult
of
fairies
spirits
and
the
dead
there
was
also
as
we
already
know
more
or
less
of
direct
worship
offered
to
fairies
like
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
sacrifice
was
made
to
them
even
as
now
when
the
irish
or
scotch
peasant
pours
a
libation
of
milk
to
the
people
or
to
the
fairy
queen

presides

tribes
worshipped
elves
they
believed
not
the
true
godhead
of
the
true
trinity
and
there
is
a
reliable
legend
concerning
columbkille
which
shows
that
this
old
cult
of
elves
was
not
forgotten
among
the
early
irish
christians
though
they
changed
the
original
good
reputation
of
these
invisible
beings
to
one
of
evil
it
is
said
that
columbkille
first
attempts
to
erect
a
church
or
monastery
on
iona
were
rendered
vain
by
the
influence
of
some
evil
spirit
or
else
of
demons
for
as
fast
as
a
wall
was
raised
it
fell
down
then
it
was
revealed
to
the
saint
that
the
walls
could
not
stand
until
a
human
victim
should
be
buried
alive
under
the
foundations
and
the
lot
fell
on
oran
columbkille
companion
who
accordingly
became
a
sacrifice
to
appease
the
evil
spirit
fairies
or
demons
of
the
place
where
the
building
was
to
be
raised
as
an
illustration
of
what
the
ancient
practice
of
such
sacrifice
to
or
to
gods
must
have
been
like
in
wales
we
offer
the
following
curious
legend
concerning
the
conception
of
myrddin
merlin
as
told
by
our
witness
from
pontrhydfendigaid
john
jones
see
building
the
castle
of
gwrtheyrn
near
carmarthen
as
much
as
was
built
by
day
fell
down
at
night
so
a
council
of
the
or
wise
men
was
called
and
they
decided
that
the
blood
of
a
fatherless
boy
had
to
be
used
in
mixing
the
mortar
if
the
wall
was
to
stand
search
was
thereupon
made
for
a
fatherless
boy
cf
and
throughout
all
the
kingdom
no
such
boy
could
be
found
but
one
day
two
boys
were
quarrelling
and
one
of
them
in
defying
the
other
wanted
to
know
what
a
fatherless
boy
like
him
had
to
say
to
him
an
officer
of
the
king
overhearing
the
quarrel
seized
the
boy
thus
tauntingly
addressed
as
the
one
so
long
looked
for
the
circumstances
were
made
known
to
the
king
and
the
boy
was
taken
to
him
who
is
your
father
asked
the
king
my
mother
never
told
me
the
boy
replied
then
the
boy
mother
was
sent
for
and
the
king
asked
her
who
the
father
of
the
boy
was
and
she
replied
i
do
not
know
for
i
have
never
known
a
man
yet
one
night
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
man
noble
and
majestic
in
appearance
slept
with
me
and
i
awoke
to
find
that
i
had
been
in
a
dream
but
when
i
grew
pregnant
afterwards
and
this
wonderful
boy
whom
you
now
see
was
delivered
i
considered
that
a
divine
being
or
an
angel
had
visited
me
in
that
dream
and
therefore
i
called
his
child
myrddin
the
magician
for
such
i
believe
my
son
to
be
when
the
mother
had
thus
spoken
the
king
announced
to
the
court
and
wise
men
here
is
the
fatherless
boy
take
his
blood
and
use
it
in
mixing
the
mortar
the
walling
will
not
hold
without
it
at
this
myrddin
taunted
the
king
and
wise
men
and
said
they
were
no
better
than
a
pack
of
idiots
the
reason
the
walling
falls
down
myrddin
went
on
to
say
is
because
you
have
tried
to
raise
it
on
a
rock
which
covers
two
large
whenever
the
wall
is
raised
over
them
its
weight
presses
on
their
backs
and
makes
them
uneasy
then
during
the
night
they
upheave
their
backs
to
relieve
themselves
of
the
pressure
and
thus
shake
the
walling
to
a
fall
the
story
ends
here
but
presumably
merlin
statements
were
found
to
be
true
and
merlin
was
not
sacrificed
for
as
we
know
he
became
the
great
magician
of
arthur
court
there
are
two
hills
in
the
highlands
of
aberdeenshire
where
travellers
had
to
propitiate
the
banshee
by
placing
cakes
near
a
well
on
each
hill
and
if
the
traveller
neglected
the
offering
death
or
some
dire
calamity
was
sure
to
follow
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
banshee
is
almost
always
thought
of
as
the
spirit
of
a
dead
ancestor
presiding
over
a
family
though
here
it
appears
more
like
the
tutelary
deity
of
the
hills
but
sacrifice
being
thus
made
according
to
the
to
a
banshee
shows
like
so
many
other
examples
where
there
is
a
confusion
between
divinities
or
fairies
and
the
souls
of
the
dead
that
ancestral
worship
must
be
held
to
play
a
very
important
part
in
the
complex
as
a
whole
a
few
parallels
determine
this
at
once
thus
exactly
as
to
fairies
here
milk
is
offered
to
the
souls
of
saints
in
the
panjab
india
as
a
means
of
propitiating
them
lefèvre
shows
that
the
roman
lares
so
frequently
compared
to
fairies
are
in
reality
quite
like
the
gaelic
banshee
that
originally
they
were
nothing
more
than
the
unattached
souls
of
the
dead
akin
to
manes
that
time
and
custom
made
distinctions
between
them
that
in
the
common
language
lares
and
manes
had
synonymous
dwellings
and
that
finally
the
idea
of
death
was
little
by
little
divorced
from
the
worship
of
the
lares
so
that
they
became
guardians
of
the
family
and
protectors
of
life
on
all
the
tombs
of
their
dead
the
romans
inscribed
these
names
the
last
of
which
meaning
silent
is
equivalent
to
the
term
of
peace
given
to
the
of
scotland
nor
were
the
roman
lares
always
thought
of
as
inhabiting
dwellings
many
were
supposed
to
live
in
the
fields
in
the
streets
of
cities
at
quite
like
certain
orders
of
fairies
and
demons
and
in
each
place
these
ancestral
spirits
had
their
chapels
and
received
offerings
of
fruit
flowers
and
of
foliage
if
neglected
they
became
spiteful
and
were
then
known
as
lemures
all
these
examples
tend
to
show
what
the
reviewer
of
curtin
of
the
fairies
and
of
the
ghost
states
that
attributes
of
a
ghost
that
is
to
say
the
spirit
of
a
dead
man
are
indistinguishable
from
those
of
a
fairy
and
it
is
well
known
how
is
the
worship
of
the
dead
and
the
offering
of
food
to
them
among
uncivilized
tribes
like
those
of
africa
australia
and
america
as
well
as
among
such
great
nations
as
china
corea
india
and
japan
and
in
ancient
times
it
was
universal
among
the
masses
of
the
people
in
egypt
greece
and
rome
celtic
and
feasts
of
the
dead
as
we
already
know
was
the
great
celtic
feast
of
the
dead
when
offerings
or
sacrifice
of
various
kinds
were
made
to
ancestral
spirits
and
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
the
under
their
control
and
or
the
first
of
may
was
another
day
anciently
dedicated
to
fêtes
in
honour
of
the
dead
and
fairies
chapter
ii
has
shown
us
how
november
eve
the
modern
and
like
it
all
saints
eve
or
are
regarded
among
the
celtic
peoples
now
and
the
history
of
seems
to
indicate
that
christianity
as
in
the
case
of
the
cult
of
trees
and
fountains
absorbed
certain
celtic
cults
of
the
dead
which
centred
around
the
pagan
feast
of
the
dead
and
even
adopted
the
date
of
see
among
the
ancient
egyptians
so
much
like
the
ancient
celts
in
their
innate
spirituality
and
clear
conceptions
of
the
invisible
world
we
find
a
parallel
feast
which
fell
on
the
seventeenth
of
the
year
this
day
was
directly
dependent
upon
the
progress
of
the
sun
and
as
we
have
throughout
emphasized
the
ancient
symbolism
connected
with
the
yearly
movements
of
the
great
god
of
light
and
life
can
not
be
divorced
from
the
ancient
doctrines
of
life
and
death
to
the
celts
the
first
of
november
or
the
festival
of
which
marked
the
end
of
summer
and
the
commencement
of
winter
was
symbolical
of
death
thus
corresponds
with
the
egyptian
fête
of
the
dead
for
the
seventeenth
of
the
year
marks
the
day
on
which
sîtou
the
god
of
darkness
killed
in
the
midst
of
a
banquet
his
brother
osiris
the
god
of
light
the
sun
and
which
was
therefore
thought
of
as
the
season
when
the
old
sun
was
dying
of
his
wounds
it
was
a
time
when
the
power
of
good
was
on
the
decline
so
that
all
nature
turning
against
man
was
abandoned
to
the
divinities
of
darkness
the
inhabitants
of
the
realms
of
the
dead
on
this
anniversary
of
the
death
of
osiris
an
egyptian
would
undertake
no
new
enterprise
should
he
go
down
to
the
nile
a
crocodile
would
attack
him
as
the
crocodile
sent
by
sîtou
had
attacked
osiris
and
even
as
the
darkness
was
attacking
the
light
to
devour
it
should
he
set
out
on
a
journey
he
would
part
from
his
home
and
family
never
to
return
his
only
course
was
to
remain
locked
in
his
house
and
there
await
in
fear
and
inaction
the
passing
of
the
night
until
osiris
returning
from
death
and
reborn
to
a
new
existence
should
rise
triumphant
over
the
forces
of
darkness
and
evil
it
is
clear
that
this
last
part
of
the
egyptian
belief
is
quite
like
the
celtic
conception
of
as
we
have
seen
ailill
and
medb
celebrating
that
festival
in
their
palace
at
cruachan
there
is
a
great
resemblance
between
the
christianized
feast
of
when
the
dead
return
to
visit
their
friends
and
to
be
entertained
for
example
as
in
brittany
and
the
beautiful
festivals
formerly
held
in
the
sînto
temples
of
japan
thus
at
nikko
thousands
of
lanterns
were
lighted
one
representing
the
spirit
of
an
ancestor
and
there
was
masquerading
and
revelry
for
the
entertainment
of
the
visiting
spirits
it
shows
how
much
religions
are
alike
each
year
the
roman
peoples
dedicated
two
days
february
to
the
honouring
of
the
dead
on
the
first
day
called
the
all
romans
were
supposed
to
remain
within
their
own
homes
the
sanctuaries
of
all
the
gods
were
closed
and
all
ceremony
suspended
the
only
sacrifices
made
at
such
a
time
were
to
the
dead
and
to
the
gods
of
the
dead
in
the
underworld
and
all
manes
were
appeased
by
of
meats
and
cakes
the
second
day
was
called
and
was
a
time
of
family
reunions
and
feasting
of
it
ovid
has
said
ii
the
visit
to
the
tombs
and
to
the
ancestors
who
are
no
longer
among
us
it
is
pleasant
to
turn
towards
the
living
after
the
loss
of
so
many
it
is
pleasant
to
behold
those
who
remain
of
our
blood
and
to
reckon
up
the
generations
of
our
descendants
and
the
greeks
also
had
their
feasts
for
the
dead
conclusion
the
fact
of
ancient
celtic
cults
of
stones
waters
trees
and
fairies
still
existing
under
cover
of
christianity
directly
sustains
the
psychological
theory
and
the
persistence
of
the
ancient
celtic
cult
of
the
dead
as
illustrated
in
the
survival
of
in
its
modern
forms
and
perhaps
best
seen
now
among
the
bretons
goes
far
to
sustain
the
opinion
of
ernest
renan
who
declared
in
his
admirable
that
of
all
peoples
the
celts
as
the
romans
also
recorded
have
most
precise
ideas
about
death
thus
it
is
that
the
celts
at
this
moment
are
the
most
spiritually
conscious
of
western
nations
to
think
of
them
as
materialists
is
impossible
since
the
time
of
patrick
and
columba
the
gaels
have
been
the
missionaries
of
europe
and
as
caesar
asserts
the
druids
were
the
ancient
teachers
of
the
gauls
no
less
than
of
all
britain
and
the
mysteries
of
life
and
death
are
the
of
all
things
really
celtic

another
series
of
tales
embodying
the
celtic
ideas
concerning
the
other
life
and
its
different
states
perhaps
the
profoundest
instinct
of
the
celtic
peoples
is
their
desire
to
penetrate
the
unknown

the

various
pagan
cults
which
also
came
to
be
more
or
less
christianized
have
been
considered
under
paganism
and
in
this
chapter
we
propose
to
examine
the
famous
purgatory
of
patrick
and
the
christian
rites
in
honour
of
the
dead
patrick
purgatory
in
the
south
of
county
donegal
in
ireland
amid
treeless
mountains
and
moorlands
lies
lough
derg
or
the
red
lake
containing
an
island
which
has
long
been
famous
throughout
christendom
as
the
site
of
purgatory
even
more
than
in
the
middle
ages
it
is
the
goal
of
thousands
of
pious
pilgrims
who
repair
thither
to
be
purified
of
the
accumulated
sins
of
a
lifetime
in
this
age
of
commercialism
the
picture
is
an
interesting
and
a
happy
one
no
matter
what
the
changing
voices
of
the
many
may
have
to
say
about
it
the
following
weird
legends
which
during
the
autumn
of
i
found
surviving
among
the
lough
derg
peasantry
explain
how
the
lough
received
its
present
name
and
seem
to
indicate
that
long
before
patrick
time
the
lough
was
already
considered
a
strange
and
mysterious
place
apparently
an
otherworld
preserve
the
first
legend
based
on
two
complementary
versions
one
from
james
ryan
of
tamlach
townland
who
is
years
old
the
other
from
arthur
monaghan
a
younger
man
who
lives
about
three
miles
from
james
ryan
is
as
follows
his
flight
from
county
armagh
finn
mac
coul
took
his
mother
on
his
shoulder
holding
her
by
the
legs
but
so
rapidly
did
he
travel
that
on
reaching
the
shores
of
the
lake
nothing
remained
of
his
mother
save
the
two
legs
and
these
he
threw
down
there
some
time
later
the
fenians
while
searching
for
finn
passed
the
same
spot
on
the
and
cinen
moul
who
was
of
their
number
upon
seeing
the
of
finn
mother
and
a
worm
in
one
said
if
that
worm
could
get
water
enough
it
would
come
to
something
great
i
give
it
water
enough
said
another
of
the
followers
and
at
that
he
flung
it
into
the
lake
later
called
finn
mac
coul
lake
immediately
the
worm
turned
into
an
enormous
this
it
was
that
patrick
had
to
fight
and
kill
and
as
the
struggle
went
on
the
lake
ran
red
with
the
blood
of
the
and
so
the
lake
came
to
be
called
loch
derg
red
lake
the
second
legend
composed
of
was
related
by
patrick
monaghan
the
caretaker
of
the
purgatory
as
he
was
rowing
me
to
saints
island
the
site
of
the
original
purgatorial
cave
and
this
legend
is
even
more
important
for
us
than
the
preceding
one
have
always
been
hearing
it
said
that
into
this
lough
patrick
drove
all
the
serpents
from
ireland
and
that
with
them
he
had
here
his
final
battle
gaining
complete
victory
the
old
men
and
women
in
this
neighbourhood
used
to
believe
that
lough
derg
was
the
last
stronghold
of
the
druids
in
ireland
and
from
what
i
have
heard
them
say
i
think
the
old
legend
means
that
this
is
where
patrick
ended
his
fight
with
the
druids
and
that
the
serpents
represent
the
druids
or
paganism
these
and
similar
legends
together
with
what
we
know
about
the
purgatorial
rites
lead
us
to
believe
that
in
times
finn
mac
coul
lake
later
called
lough
derg
was
venerated
as
sacred
and
that
the
cave
which
then
undoubtedly
existed
on
saints
island
was
used
as
a
centre
for
the
celebration
of
pagan
mysteries
similar
in
character
to
those
supposed
to
have
been
celebrated
in
new
grange
evidently
in
the
ordeals
and
ceremonies
of
the
modern
christian
purgatory
of
patrick
we
see
the
survivals
of
such
pagan
initiatory
rites
just
as
the
cults
of
stones
trees
fountains
lakes
and
waters
were
absorbed
by
the
new
religion
so
it
would
seem
were
all
cults
rendered
in
prehistoric
times
to
finn
mac
coul
lake
and
within
the
island
cave
though
the
present
location
of
the
purgatory
is
not
the
original
place
of
the
old
celtic
cults
there
having
been
a
transfer
from
island
to
station
island
the
present
place
of
pilgrimage
where
instead
of
the
cave
there
is
the
chapel
the
practices
though
naturally
much
modified
and
corrupted
retain
their
primitive
outlines
patrick
in
his
time
ordered
the
observance
of
the
following
ceremonies
by
all
penitents
before
their
entrance
into
the
original
cave
on
island
and
for
a
long
time
they
were
strictly
carried
out
visitor
must
first
go
to
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
declare
to
him
that
he
came
of
his
own
free
will
and
request
of
him
permission
to
make
the
pilgrimage
the
bishop
warned
him
against
venturing
any
further
in
his
design
and
represented
to
him
the
perils
of
his
undertaking
but
if
the
pilgrim
still
remained
steadfast
in
his
purpose
he
gave
him
a
recommendatory
letter
to
the
prior
of
the
island
the
prior
again
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
his
design
by
the
same
arguments
that
had
been
previously
urged
by
the
bishop
if
however
the
pilgrim
still
remained
steadfast
he
was
taken
into
the
church
to
spend
there
fifteen
days
in
fasting
and
praying
after
this
the
mass
was
celebrated
the
holy
communion
administered
to
him
and
holy
water
sprinkled
over
him
and
he
was
led
in
procession
with
reading
of
litanies
to
the
entrance
of
the
purgatory
where
a
third
attempt
was
made
to
dissuade
him
from
entering
if
he
still
persisted
the
prior
allowed
him
to
enter
the
cave
after
he
had
received
the
benediction
of
the
priests
and
in
entering
he
commended
himself
to
their
prayers
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
with
his
own
hand
the
prior
then
made
fast
the
door
and
opened
it
not
again
till
the
next
morning
when
if
the
penitent
were
there
he
was
taken
out
and
led
with
great
joy
to
the
church
and
after
fifteen
days
watching
and
praying
was
dismissed
if
he
was
not
found
when
the
door
was
opened
it
was
understood
that
he
had
perished
in
his
pilgrimage
through
purgatory
the
door
was
closed
again
and
he
was
never
afterwards
mentioned
an
enormous
mass
of
literary
and
historical
material
was
recorded
during
the
mediaeval
period
in
various
european
vernaculars
and
in
latin
concerning
patrick
purgatory
and
all
of
it
testifies
to
the
widespread
influence
of
the
rites
which
already
then
as
now
attracted
thousands
of
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
christendom
in
the
poem
of
which
forms
part
of
this
material
we
find
a
poetical
description
of
the
purgatorial
initiatory
rites
quite
comparable
to
virgil
account
of
aeneas
on
his
initiatory
journey
to
hades
the
poem
records
how
sir
owain
was
locked
in
the
cave
and
how
after
a
short
time
he
began
to
penetrate
its
depths
he
had
but
little
light
and
this
by
degrees
disappeared
leaving
him
in
total
darkness
then
a
strange
twilight
appeared
he
went
on
to
a
hall
and
there
met
fifteen
men
clad
in
white
and
with
heads
shaven
after
the
manner
of
ecclesiastics
one
of
them
told
owain
what
things
he
would
have
to
suffer
in
his
pilgrimage
how
unclean
spirits
would
attack
him
and
by
what
means
he
could
withstand
them
then
the
fifteen
men
left
the
knight
alone
and
soon
all
sorts
of
demons
and
ghosts
and
spirits
surrounded
him
and
he
was
led
on
from
one
torture
and
trial
to
another
by
different
companies
of
fiends
in
the
original
latin
legend
there
were
four
fields
of
punishment
finally
owain
came
to
a
magic
bridge
which
appeared
safe
and
wide
but
when
he
reached
the
middle
of
it
all
the
fiends
and
demons
and
unclean
spirits
raised
so
horrible
a
yell
that
he
almost
fell
into
the
chasm
below
he
however
reached
the
other
shore
and
the
power
of
the
devils
ceased
before
him
was
a
celestial
city
and
the
perfumed
air
which
was
wafted
from
it
was
so
ravishing
that
he
forgot
all
his
pains
and
sorrows
a
procession
came
to
owain
and
welcoming
him
led
him
into
the
paradise
where
adam
and
eve
dwelt
before
they
had
eaten
the
apple
food
was
offered
to
the
knight
and
when
he
had
eaten
of
it
he
had
no
desire
to
return
to
earth
but
he
was
told
that
it
was
necessary
to
live
out
his
natural
life
in
the
world
and
to
leave
his
flesh
and
bones
behind
him
before
beginning
the
heavenly
existence
so
he
began
his
return
journey
to
the
cave
entrance
by
a
short
and
pleasant
way
he
again
passed
the
fifteen
men
clad
in
white
who
revealed
what
things
the
future
had
in
store
for
him
and
reaching
the
door
safely
waited
there
till
morning
then
he
was
taken
out
congratulated
and
invited
to
remain
with
the
priests
for
fifteen
days
here
we
have
clearly
enough
many
of
the
essential
features
of
the
underworld
there
is
the
mystic
bridge
which
when
crossed
guarantees
the
traveller
against
evil
spirits
just
as
in
ireland
a
peasant
believes
himself
safe
when
fairies
are
pursuing
him
if
he
can
only
cross
a
bridge
or
stream
the
celestial
city
is
both
like
the
christian
heaven
and
the
world
the
eating
of
angel
food
by
owain
has
an
effect
quite
like
that
of
eating
food
in
fairyland
but
owain
by
christian
influence
is
sent
back
on
earth
to
die
death
which
the
king
of
heaven
and
earth
hath
ordained
as
patrick
said
of
the
prince
whom
he
saved
from
the
a
curious
story
in
which
king
arthur
himself
is
made
to
visit
patrick
purgatory
published
during
the
sixteenth
century
by
a
learned
frenchman
stephanus
forcatulus
shows
how
real
a
relation
there
is
between
purgatory
and
the
greek
or
roman
hades
arthur
it
is
said
leaving
the
light
behind
him
descended
into
the
cave
by
a
rough
and
steep
road
they
say
that
this
cave
is
an
entrance
to
the
shades
or
at
least
to
purgatory
where
poor
sinners
may
get
their
offences
washed
out
and
return
again
rejoicing
to
the
light
of
day
but
forcatulus
adds
that
have
learnt
from
certain
serious
commentaries
of
merlin
that
gawain
his
master
of
horse
called
arthur
back
and
dissuaded
him
from
examining
further
the
horrid
cave
in
which
was
heard
the
sound
of
falling
water
which
emitted
a
sulphureous
smell
and
of
voices
lamenting
as
it
were
for
the
loss
of
their
bodies
purgatorial
and
initiatory
rites
judging
from
the
above
data
and
from
the
great
mass
of
similar
data
available
the
religious
rites
connected
with
patrick
purgatory
are
to
be
anthropologically
interpreted
in
the
light
of
what
is
known
about
ancient
and
modern
initiatory
ceremonies
similarly
conducted
as
has
already
been
stated
the
original
purgatory
which
was
in
a
cave
on
saints
island
is
typified
by
chapel
on
station
island
and
in
this
chapel
as
formerly
in
the
cave
pilgrims
after
having
fasted
and
performed
the
necessary
preparatory
penances
are
required
to
pass
the
night
among
the
greeks
neophytes
seeking
initiation
after
similar
preparation
entered
the
recently
discovered
at
eleusis
the
site
of
the
great
mysteries
and
therein
in
the
entered
into
communion
with
the
god
and
goddess
of
the
lower
world
whereas
in
the
original
purgatory
sir
owain
and
arthur
are
described
as
having
come
into
contact
with
the
and
its
beings
in
the
state
cult
at
acharaca
greece
there
was
another
in
which
initiations
were
conducted
the
oracle
of
zeus
trophonius
was
situated
in
a
subterranean
chamber
into
which
after
various
preparatory
rites
including
the
invocation
of
agamedes
neophytes
descended
to
receive
in
a
very
mysterious
manner
the
divine
revelations
which
were
afterwards
interpreted
for
them
so
were
the
descent
into
the
cave
and
the
sights
therein
seen
that
it
was
popularly
believed
that
no
one
who
visited
the
cave
ever
smiled
again
and
persons
of
grave
and
serious
aspect
were
proverbially
said
to
have
been
in
the
cave
of
trophonius
the
worship
of
mithras
the
persian
god
of
created
light
and
all
earthly
wisdom
who
in
time
became
identified
with
the
sun
was
conducted
in
natural
and
artificial
caves
found
in
every
part
of
the
roman
empire
where
his
cult
flourished
until
superseded
by
christianity
and
in
these
caves
very
elaborate
initiations
of
seven
degrees
were
carried
out
the
cave
itself
signified
the
lower
world
into
which
during
the
ordeals
of
initiation
the
neophyte
was
supposed
to
enter
while
out
of
the
physical
body
that
the
soul
might
be
purged
by
many
trials
in
mexico
the
cavern
of
chalchatongo
led
to
the
plains
of
paradise
evidently
through
initiations
and
mictlan
a
subterranean
temple
similarly
led
to
the
aztec
land
of
the
dead
among
the
most
widespread
and
characteristic
features
of
contemporary
primitive
races
we
find
highly
developed
mysteries
puberty
institutions
of
the
same
essential
character
as
these
ancient
mysteries
they
are
to
uncivilized
youth
what
the
greek
mysteries
were
to
greek
youth
and
what
colleges
and
universities
are
to
the
youth
of
europe
and
america
though
perhaps
more
successful
than
these
last
as
places
of
moral
and
religious
instruction
these
mysteries
vary
from
tribe
to
tribe
though
in
almost
all
of
them
there
is
what
corresponds
to
the
death
rite
in
freemasonry
that
is
to
say
there
is
either
a
symbolical
presentation
of
death
in
a
sacred
drama
as
there
was
among
the
greeks
in
their
complete
initiatory
rites
or
a
state
of
actual
trance
imposed
upon
each
neophyte
by
the
priestly
initiators
the
of
these
primitive
mysteries
is
sometimes
in
a
natural
or
artificial
cavern
as
was
the
rule
with
respect
to
the
ancient
mysteries
and
patrick
purgatory
on
saints
island
sometimes
in
a
structure
specially
prepared
to
exclude
the
light
or
else
the
neophytes
are
symbolically
or
literally
buried
in
an
underground
place
to
be
resurrected
greatly
purified
and
strengthened
and
the
mystic
purification
at
the
and
spiritual
sought
in
the
cave
at
eleusis
by
the
highly
cultured
athenians
and
their
fellow
greeks
or
among
other
cultured
and
uncultured
ancient
and
modern
peoples
through
some
corresponding
initiation
ceremony
find
their
parallel
in
the
purification
and
spiritual
still
sought
in
the
christian
purgatory
now
chapel
and
in
the
lake
waters
amid
the
solitude
of
sacred
lough
derg
ireland
by
thousands
of
earnest
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
the
world
there
is
a
correspondence
between
this
conclusion
and
what
was
said
about
the
initiatory
aspects
of
the
aengus
cult
and
should
we
try
to
connect
the
purgatory
with
some
particular
of
a
character
parallel
to
that
of
the
aengus
cult
we
should
probably
have
to
name
lug
the
great
irish
because
of
the
significant
fact
that
the
purgatorial
rites
on
station
island
come
to
an
end
on
the
festival
of
the
assumption
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
of
august
a
date
which
apparently
coincides
sufficiently
to
represent
as
it
probably
does
the
ancient
august
lugnasadh
the
of
august
a
day
sacred
to
the
lug
as
the
name
indicates
if
we
are
to
class
together
the
original
purgatory
new
grange
gavrinis
and
other
celtic
underground
places
as
centres
of
the
highest
religious
practices
in
the
past
we
should
expect
to
discover
that
many
similar
structures
or
natural
caverns
existed
in
pagan
ireland
as
indeed
we
find
they
did
thus
in
different
irish
manuscripts
various
caves
are
mentioned
and
most
of
them
so
far
as
they
can
be
localized
are
traditionally
places
of
supernatural
marvels
and
often
as
in
the
case
of
the
last
one
enumerated
the
cave
of
cruachan
are
directly
related
to
the
another
of
these
caves
is
described
as
being
under
a
church
which
circumstance
suggests
that
the
church
was
dedicated
over
an
underground
place
originally
sacred
to
pagan
worship
and
as
we
may
safely
assume
to
pagan
mysteries
the
curious
custom
among
early
irish
christians
of
retiring
for
a
time
to
a
cave
seems
to
show
the
lasting
into
historical
times
of
the
pagan
now
surviving
at
lough
derg
only
the
custom
seems
to
have
been
common
among
the
saints
of
britain
and
of
scotland
and
in
stokes
life
of
there
is
a
very
significant
reference
to
it
in
the
story
of
and
there
seems
to
be
another
traditional
echo
of
the
times
when
caves
were
used
for
religious
rites
or
worship
in
the
reference
to
the
cave
of
the
witch
orddu
as
being
the
confines
of
hell
a
cave
was
thus
popularly
supposed
to
lead
to
hades
or
an
underworld
of
fairies
demons
and
spirits
again
just
as
in
patrick
purgatory
purely
celtic
instances
of
this
kind
might
be
greatly
multiplied
pagan
origin
of
purgatorial
doctrine
the
metrical
romance
of
and
in
ritson
of
metrical
illustrates
how
in
britain
and
britain
even
england
is
more
celtic
than
saxon
the
grecian
hell
or
hades
was
looked
on
as
identical
with
the
celtic
fairyland
this
is
quite
unusual
and
for
us
is
highly
significant
it
shows
that
in
britain
at
the
time
the
romance
was
written
there
was
no
essential
difference
between
the
underworld
of
fairies
and
the
underworld
of
shades
pluto
realm
and
the
realm
where
fairy
kings
and
fairy
queens
held
high
revelry
were
the
same
the
difference
is
this
hades
was
an
egyptian
and
in
turn
a
greek
conception
while
fairyland
was
a
celtic
conception
they
differ
as
the
imagination
at
work
on
a
philosophical
doctrine
differs
among
the
three
peoples
and
not
otherwise
and
as
wright
has
shown
the
origin
of
purgatory
in
the
roman
church
is
very
obscure
as
to
the
location
of
purgatory
roman
theology
confesses
it
has
nothing
certain
to
say
the
natural
conclusion
as
we
suggested
in
our
study
of
would
seem
to
be
that
the
irish
doctrine
of
the
otherworld
in
all
its
aspects
but
especially
as
the
underground
world
of
the
or
was
combined
with
the
pagan
doctrine
of
hades
in
patrick
purgatory
and
hence
gave
rise
to
the
modern
christian
doctrine
of
purgatory
christian
rites
in
honour
of
the
departed
we
may
now
readily
pass
from
an
examination
of
rites
concerned
with
death
and
which
are
based
on
an
ancient
to
an
examination
of
their
shadows
in
the
theology
of
christianity
where
they
are
commonly
known
as
the
rites
in
honour
of
the
departed
it
seems
to
be
clear
at
the
outset
that
the
christian
fête
in
commemoration
of
the
dead
according
to
its
history
is
an
adaptation
from
paganism
and
with
so
many
irish
ecclesiastics
or
else
their
disciples
educated
in
the
celtic
monasteries
of
britain
and
ireland
having
influence
in
the
church
during
the
early
centuries
there
is
a
strong
probability
that
the
feast
of
had
something
to
do
with
shaping
the
modern
feast
as
we
have
suggested
in
the
preceding
chapter
for
both
feasts
originally
fell
on
the
first
of
november
roman
catholic
writers
record
that
it
was
odilon
abbot
of
cluny
who
instituted
in
in
all
his
congregations
the
fête
in
commemoration
of
the
dead
and
fixed
its
anniversary
on
the
first
of
november
and
that
this
fête
was
quickly
adopted
by
all
the
churches
of
the
east
in
the
roman
church
both
the
first
and
second
of
november
are
holy
days
devoted
to
those
who
have
passed
out
of
this
life
the
first
day
the
fête
of
all
the
saints
is
said
to
have
originated
thus
the
roman
pantheon
pantheon
meaning
the
residence
of
all
the
gods
was
dedicated
to
jupiter
the
avenger
and
when
christianity
triumphed
the
pagan
images
were
overthrown
and
there
was
thereupon
originally
established
in
place
of
the
cult
of
all
the
gods
the
fête
of
all
the
saints
why
should
have
become
a
feast
of
the
dead
would
be
difficult
to
say
unless
we
admit
the
ancient
celtic
feast
of
the
dead
as
having
amalgamated
with
it
this
we
believe
is
what
took
place
for
if
the
fête
in
commemoration
of
the
dead
was
as
some
authorities
hold
established
by
odilon
to
fall
on
the
first
of
november
in
direct
accord
with
or
halloween
then
at
some
later
period
it
was
displaced
by
for
now
it
is
celebrated
on
the
second
of
november
likewise
prayers
and
masses
for
the
dead
which
annually
receive
emphasis
on
the
first
two
days
of
november
seem
to
have
had
their
origin
in
cults
according
to
mosheim
in
his
the
usage
of
celebrating
the
sacrament
at
the
tombs
of
martyrs
and
at
funerals
was
introduced
during
the
fourth
century
and
from
this
usage
the
masses
for
the
saints
and
for
the
dead
originated
in
the
eighth
century
prior
to
the
fourth
century
we
find
the
newly
converted
christians
in
all
parts
of
celtic
europe
and
in
many
countries
still
rendering
a
cult
to
ancestral
spirits
making
food
offerings
at
the
tombs
of
heroes
and
strictly
observing
the
very
ancient
november
feast
or
its
equivalent
in
honour
of
the
dead
and
fairies
then
very
gradually
in
the
course
of
four
centuries
the
character
of
the
christian
cults
and
feasts
of
the
saints
and
of
the
dead
seems
to
have
been
determined
the
following

serve
to
illustrate
the
nature
of

christian
rites

of

the
we

prayers
and

for

were
offered
by
the

sometimes
during
thirty
and
even
forty
days

offered
on

third

the
thirtieth
days
being
the
most
solemn
the
history
of
the
venerable
bede
the
letters
of
boniface
and
of
lul
prove
that
even
in
the
ancient
anglican
church
prayers
were
offered
up
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
and
a
council
of
bishops

at

the
souls
of
all
those
who
were

in
the
french
wars
of
the
fifteenth
century
conclusion
as
seems
to
be
evident
from
this
and
the
two
preceding
chapters
all
these
fêtes
rites
or
observances
of
christianity
have
a
relation
more
or
less
direct
to
paganism
and
thus
to
ancient
celtic
cults
and
sacrifice
offered
to
the
dead
to
spirits
and
to
the
tuatha
de
danann
or
fairies
and
the
same
set
of
ideas
which
operated
among
the
celts
to
create
their
ideas
arising
out
of
a
belief
in
or
knowledge

the

and
in

is
scientific
method
of
examination
the
promise
made
in
the
introduction
to
examine
the
why
of
the
belief
in
fairies
must
now
be
fulfilled
by
calling
in
the
aid
of
modern
science
to
adduce
parallels
when
studying
a
religion
or
a
mythology
is
worth
doing
in
order
to
show
the
fundamental
bond
which
unites
all
systems
of
belief
in
things
called
spiritual
but
it
is
more
important
to
try
to
understand
why
there
should
be
such
parallels
and
such
a
unifying
principle
behind
them
perhaps
there
has
been
too
much
of
a
tendency
among
students
of
and
of
anthropology
as
a
whole
to
be
content
to
do
no
more
than
to
discover
that
the
eskimos
in
greenland
hold
a
belief
in
spirits
parallel
to
a
belief
in
spirits
held
in
central
africa
or
that
the
greek
pantheon
and
possibly
the
celtic
one
as
well
consists
of
goddesses
which
are
apparently
and
of
gods
which
are
apparently
aryan
we
too
have
drawn
many
parallels
between
the
celtic
and
the
various
throughout
the
world
but
now
we
should
attempt
to
find
out
why
there
are
animistic
beliefs
at
all
this
chapter
then
will
confine
itself
to
a
scientific
examination
of
the
more
popular
or
as
it
may
be
called
the
exoteric
aspect
of
the
which
has
come
to
us
directly
from
the
masses
of
the
celtic
peoples
the
following
chapter
which
is
corollary
to
the
present
one
will
deal
especially
with
the
mystical
aspect
or
as
this
may
be
called
by
contrast
the
esoteric
aspect
of
the
same
belief
which
in
turn
has
come
to
us
from
learned
mystics
and
seers
who
form
in
proportion
but
a
very
small
minority
of
the
modern
celts
each
of
these
complementary
aspects
of
the
celtic
religion
undoubtedly
has
its
origin
in
the
remotest
antiquity
this
is
probably
more
readily
seen
with
respect
to
the
former
than
to
the
latter
the
latter
has
been
esoteric
always
and
in
our
opinion
shows
an
unbroken
tradition
if
only
a
very
incomplete
one
from
druidic
times
and
it
depends
less
upon
written
records
because
the
druids
had
none
than
upon
oral
transmission
from
age
to
age
both
aspects
of
the
have
in
modern
times
absorbed
many
ideas
from
systems
of
religion
and
mystical
thought
as
jenner
has
suggested
in
his
introduction
for
cornwall
and
as
certain
details
in
chapter
ii
clearly
indicate
systems
of
modern
theosophy
have
had
a
marked
influence
in
this
respect
but
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
say
what
parts
of
the
are
purely
celtic
and
what
are
not
so
because
comparative
studies
prove
that
mysticism
is
fundamentally
the
same
in
all
ages
and
among
all
peoples
it
is
psychologically
true
also
that
there
must
always
exist
some
sort
of
affinity
between
two
sets
of
thought
in
order
for
them
to
coalesce
hence
if
modern
mysticism
derived
from
oriental
or
other
sources
has
as
we
believe
affected
celtic
mysticism
as
handed
down
from
the
dim
druidic
ages
it
is
merely
because
the
two
occupy
a
common
psychical
territory
we
must
therefore
be
content
to
examine
scientifically
the
as
it
now
presents
itself
the
analysis
of
evidence
in
chapter
iii
indicates
clearly
that
there
is
in
the
exoteric
part
of
the
modern
celtic
belief
in
fairies
considerable
degeneration
from
what
must
have
been
in
pagan
times
a
widespread
and
highly
developed
animistic
creed
in
the
esoteric
part
of
it
there
will
be
observed
instead
of
such
degeneracy
a
surprisingly
elaborate
system
of
the
most
subtle
speculation
which
parallels
that
of
east
indian
systems
of
metaphysics
if
the
belief
be
looked
at
in
this
comprehensive
manner
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
to
some
extent
at
least
as
has
been
pointed
out
already
pp
the
in
its
purest
form
originated
amongst
the
most
highly
educated
and
scientific
celts
of
ancient
times
rather
than
among
their
unlearned
fellows
the
two
aspects
of
the
belief
form
an
harmonious
whole
as
they
will
be
presented
in
this
section
iv
chapter
xi
depends
mostly
upon
the
evidence
set
forth
in
chapter
ii
chapter
xii
depends
mostly
upon
the
evidence
set
forth
in
chapter
vii
in
chapter
iii
we
examined
anthropologically
the
modern
and
both
there
and
in
parts
of
chapters
following
the
historical
and
ancient
belief
in
fairies
in
celtic
countries
and
found
it
to
be
in
essence
animistic
social
psychology
anthropomorphism
generally
adequately
explained
by
far
the
greater
mass
of
the
evidence
presented
but
the
animistic
background
of
the
belief
in
question
presented
problems
which
the
strictly
anthropological
sciences
are
unable
to
solve
the
point
has
now
been
reached
when
these
problems
must
be
presented
to
physiology
and
to
psychology
for
solution
if
they
can
be
completely
solved
by
purely
rational
and
physical
data
then
the
as
a
whole
will
have
to
be
cast
aside
as
worthless
in
the
eyes
of
science
in
our
generation
however
such
a
casting
aside
is
not
to
be
the
fate
of
the
of
the
celts
the
following
phenomena
recorded
in
chapter
ii
and
elsewhere
throughout
our
study
and
designated
as
the
or
unknown
quantity
of
the
can
not
at
the
present
time
be
satisfactorily
explained
by
science
collective
hallucinations
and
veridical
hallucinations
objects
moving
without
contact
raps
and
noises
called
telepathy
seership
and
visions
dream
and
trance
states
manifesting
supernormal
knowledge
or
independently
of
our
own
celtic
data
in
their
support
the
first
class
of
phenomena
are
supported
by
an
enormous
mass
of
good
data
scientifically
collected
the
second
and
third
class
are
less
well
supported
telepathy
is
almost
generally
accepted
as
now
being
established
the
last
three
classes
are
hypothetically
accepted
by
many
authorities
in
pathology
psychology
and
psychical
research
scientific
attitudes
towards
the
animistic
hypothesis
assertions
similar
to
ours
that
phenomena
like
these
are
incapable
of
being
explained
away
by
any
known
laws
of
orthodox
science
have
helped
to
bring
about
a
marked
division
in
the
ranks
of
scientific
workers
on
one
hand
there
are
those
scientists
who
deny
the
existence
of
anything
not
capable
of
being
mathematically
tested
weighed
dissected
or
otherwise
analysed
in
laboratories
on
the
other
hand
there
are
their
colleagues
who
often
in
spite
of
previous
bias
toward
materialism
have
arrived
at
a
personal
conviction
that
an
animistic
view
of
man
is
more
in
harmony
with
their
scientific
experience
than
any
other
both
schools
include
men
eminent
in
all
branches
of
biological
sciences
midway
between
these
contending
schools
are
the
who
maintain
that
man
is
a
twofold
being
composed
of
a
psychical
and
physical
part
some
of
them
are
inclined
to
favour
animism
others
are
unwilling
to
regard
the
psychical
part
of
man
as
separable
from
the
physical
part
so
the
world
of
science
is
divided
under
such
chaotic
conditions
of
science
it
is
our
right
to
accept
one
view
or
another
or
to
reject
all
views
and
use
scientific
data
independently
there
can
be
no
final
court
of
appeal
in
matters
where
opinion
is
thus
divided
save
the
experience
of
coming
generations
we
are
therefore
content
to
state
our
own
position
and
leave
it
to
the
future
for
rejection
or
acceptance
as
the
case
may
be
to
attempt
a
critical
examination
of
the
thousand
and
one
theories
occupying
the
modern
arena
of
scientific
controversy
about
the
essential
nature
of
man
is
altogether
beyond
the
scope
of
this
work
we
must
nevertheless
blaze
a
rough
footpath
through
the
jungle
of
scientific
theories
and
at
the
outset
put
on
record
our
opposition
to
that
school
of
scientific
workers
who
deny
to
man
a
supersensuous
constitution
their
theory
if
carried
out
to
its
logical
conclusion
is
now
essentially
no
different
from
feuerbach
theory
at
a
time
when
science
was
far
less
developed
than
it
is
he
held
that
object
of
sense
or
the
sensuous
alone
is
really
true
and
therefore
truth
reality
and
the
sensible
are
one
to
say
that
we
know
reality
through
sensual
perception
is
an
error
as
all
schools
of
scientists
must
nowadays
admit
nature
is
for
ever
illuding
the
senses
she
masquerades
in
disguise
until
science
tears
away
her
mask
we
must
always
adjust
the
senses
to
the
world
itself
where
there
are
only
vibrations
in
ether
man
sees
light
and
in
atmospheric
vibrations
he
hears
sound
we
only
know
things
through
the
way
in
which
our
senses
react
upon
them
we
sum
up
the
by
saying
does
not
exhaust
its
object
the
world
perceptibility
and
reality
thus
not
being
coincident
man
and
the
universe
remain
an
unsolved
problem
despite
the
noisy
shoutings
of
the
materialist
in
his
hermetically
sealed
and
case
called
sensual
perceptions
science
admits
that
all
her
explanations
of
the
universe
are
mere
products
of
human
understanding
and
perceptions
by
the
physical
senses
the
universe
of
science
is
wholly
a
universe
of
phenomena
and
behind
phenomena
as
no
scientist
would
dare
deny
there
must
be
the
noumena
the
ultimate
causes
of
all
things
as
to
which
science
as
yet
offers
no
comprehensive
hypothesis
much
less
an
answer
to
consider
the
materialistic
hypothesis
as
adequate
to
account
for
the
residuum
or
of
the
would
not
even
be
reasonable
and
incontestably
would
not
be
scientific
when
scientists
holding
to
the
view
of
life
are
driven
from
their
now
for
the
most
part
abandoned
fortress
built
by
german
scientists
of
the
last
century
of
whom
feuerbach
was
a
type
they
in
opposing
the
animists
occupy
a
more
modernly
equipped
fortress
called
the
pathological
theory
this
theory
is
that
telepathy
hallucinations
or
the
voluntary
and
involuntary
exercise
of
any
faculties
on
the
part
of
men
and
women
with
the
resulting
phenomena
can
be
explained
as
due
to
abnormal
and
hence
according
to
its
point
of
view
diseased
states
of
the
human
organism
or
to
some
derangement
of
bodily
functions
leading
to
delusions
resembling
those
of
insanity
which
by
a
sort
of
hypnosis
telepathically
induced
may
even
affect
researchers
and
lead
them
into
erroneous
conclusions
all
scientists
are
in
agreement
with
the
pathological
theory
in
so
far
as
it
rejects
as
unworthy
of
serious
consideration
all
apparitions
and
abnormal
phenomena
save
those
observed
by
sane
and
healthy
percipients
under
ordinary
conditions
and
accordingly
whenever
there
can
be
shown
in
our
percipients
a
diseased
mental
or
psychical
state
we
must
eliminate
their
testimony
without
argument
but
since
we
have
endeavoured
to
present
no
testimony
from
celtic
percipients
who
are
not
physically
and
psychically
normal
the
pathological
theory
at
best
can
affect
the
merely
hypothetically
the
following
admission
in
regard
to
visual
and
auditory
hallucinations
is
here
worth
noting
as
coming
from
so
thorough
an
exponent
of
materialistic
psychology
as
théodule
ribot
must
exist
anatomical
and
physiological
causes
which
would
solve
the
problem
but
unfortunately
they
are
hidden
from
us
of
these
hidden
causes
which
he
thinks
create
all
psychical
states
of
mind
or
consciousness
called
by
him
of
personality
ribot
says
ignorance
of
the
causes
stops
us
short
the
psychologist
is
here
like
the
physician
who
has
to
deal
with
a
disease
in
which
he
can
make
out
only
the
symptoms
what
physiological
influences
are
they
which
thus
alter
the
general
tone
of
the
organism
consequently
of
the
coenaesthesis
consequently
too
of
the
memory
is
it
some
condition
of
the
vascular
system
or
some
inhibitory
action
some
arrest
of
function
we
can
not
say
and
after
six
years
of
most
careful
experimentation
charles
richet
professor
of
physiology
in
the
faculty
of
medicine
in
paris
reached
this
conclusion
exists
in
certain
persons
at
certain
moments
a

has
no
with
our
normal
faculties

that
kind
we
seem
to
have
here
the
last
words
of
science

the
pathological
theory

driven
from
their
pathological
stronghold
and
they
maintain
that
they
have
not
been
driven
from
it

always
find
a
safe
way
to
cover
their
retreat
by
setting
up
the
charge
that
all
psychical
phenomena
are
fraudulent
or
else
due
to
delusion
on
the
part
of
observers
in
reply
psychical
researchers
readily
admit
that
there
is
a
large
percentage
of
mere
trickery
delusion
and
imposture
in
observed
phenomena
some
of
which
is
deliberate
on
the
part
of
the
and
some
of
which
is
apparently
not
consciously
induced
nevertheless
such
investigators
are
not
at
all
willing
to
say
that
there
is
nothing
more
than
this
the
delusion
and
imposture
theory
will
account
for
a
very
respectable
proportion
of
these
phenomena
but
not
for
all
of
them
and
theoretically
we
shall
admit
its
application
to
the
parallel
phenomena
attributed
to
fairies
though
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
phenomena
are
for
the
most
part
spontaneously
exhibited
rather
than
as
in
set
up
through
holding
further
there
are
comparatively
few

men
the

the

who
ever
make
money
out
of
their
ability
to
deal
with
the
people
or
whence
the
margin
of
encouragement
for
fraudulent
production
of
phenomena
is
extremely
limited
when
compared
with
after
years
of
experimentation
more
or
less
continuous
with
during
which
every
conceivable
test
for
the
detection
of
fraud
on
their
part
was
applied

off

as

andrew
lang
one
of
the
bravest
of
psychical
researchers
in
england
not
only
would
agree
with
william
james
in
this
but
having
carefully
examined
the
delusion
and
imposture
theory
from
the
more
commanding
point
of
view
of
an
anthropologist
would
go
further
and
include
classical
spiritualistic
phenomena
as
well
as
those
existing
among
contemporary
uncultured
races
he
says
the
extraordinary
similarity
of
savage
and
classical
spiritualistic
rites
with
the
corresponding
similarity
of
alleged
modern
phenomena
raises
problems
which
it
is
more
easy
to
state
than
to
solve
for
example
such
occurrences
as
rappings
as
the
movement
of
untouched
objects
as
the
lights
of
the
room
are
all
easily
feigned
but
that
ignorant
modern
knaves
should
feign
precisely
the
same
raps
lights
and
movements
as
the
most
remote
and
unsophisticated
barbarians
and
as
the
educated
platonists
of
the
fourth
century
after
christ
and
that
many
of
the
other
phenomena
should
be
identical
in
each
case
is
certainly
noteworthy
evidently
then
there
is
a
large
proportion
of
psychical
and
phenomena
which
remain
unexplained
even
after
the
delusion
and
imposture
theory
has
been
applied
to
such
phenomena
and
in
all
such
cases
we
must
look
further
for
a
scientific
explanation
problems
of
consciousness
our
chief
investigations
will
at
first
be
directed
more
especially
to
the
problems
common
both
to
psychology
and
to
psychical
research
namely
dream
and
trance
states
hallucinations
and
possessions
in
order
to
show
what
bearings
if
any
they
have
in
the
eyes
of
science
upon
parallel
phenomena
said
to
be
due
to
fairies
and
set
forth
in
chapter
ii
and
anthropologically
examined
in
chapter
iii
the
popular
opinion
that
dreams
are
nonsense
is
quite
overthrown
by
definite
psychological
facts
when
during
sleep
our
sensory
organs
are
exposed
to
external
irritants
the
impressions
physically
produced
are
transmitted
to
the
brain
by
the
nervous
system
and
react
in
dreams
as
they
would
in
the
waking
state
except
that
the
reactions
in
the
two
states
of
consciousness
the
dream
state
and
the
waking
state
differ
in
proportion
as
the
two
states
differ
but
in
both
the
ego
is
the
real
percipient
such
stimuli
as
arise
from
dinners
and
so
forth
produce
a
type
of
dreams
and
the
same
stimuli
at
the
same
period
of
time
would
produce
an
equal
effect
though
an
altered
one
to
suit
the
altered
conditions
if
the
waking
state
were
active
rather
than
the
dream
state
just
as
would
all
dreams
which
arise
from
pathological
disturbances
in
disease
or
abnormal
physiological
functions
this
is
evident
from
dreams
of
a
morbid
and
sensual
type
which
directly
affect
the
physical
organism
and
its
functions
as
parallel
would
in
all
such
dreams
of
the
lower
order
animal
and
purely
physical
tendencies
which
are
directly
due
to
the
state
of
the
body
act
very
freely
an
imperfectly
balanced
temporarily
deranged
or
diseased
organism
must
correspondingly
respond
to
its
driving
forces
and
it
is
clear
from
comparative
study
of
phenomena
that
these
lower
kinds
of
dream
states
express
only
the
lower
or
animal
consciousness
which
in
most
individuals
is
the
predominant
or
only
consciousness
even
in
the
waking
life
and
not
the
higher
consciousness
of
the
ego
or
subconsciousness
which
may
be
expressed
in
somnambulism
for
somnambulism
there
awakes
an
inner
second
ego
which
is
the
subliminal
self
of
myers
stout
urges
against
myers
theory
of
the
subliminal
self
that
usual
incoherence
of
dreams
is
an
objection
to
regarding
them
as
manifestations
of
a
stream
of
thought
equal
or
superior
in
systematic
complexity
and
continuity
to
that
of
the
waking
self
which
objection
myers
also
observed
but
if
we
regard
all
dreams
which
are
of
the
lower
order
as
being
due
to
the
imperfect
response
of
the
body
to
its
driving
forces
because
of
various
bad
physical
conditions
in
the
body
and
recognize
that
these
driving
forces
depend
ultimately
on
the
subconsciousness
the
difficulty
seems
to
be
met
by
observing
that
under
such
conditions
there
is
no
real
mergence
of
the
normal
consciousness
into
the
subconsciousness
hence
ordinary
dreams
are
within
the
ordinary
spectrum
of
consciousness
but
dreams
pass
beyond
the
ordinary
spectrum
into
the
truly
supernormal
state
of
consciousness
as
all
this
indicates
dreams
are
of
many
classes
those
of
the
lowest
type
which
we
have
explained
as
due
to
bad
physiological
conditions
in
the
those
which
are
readily
explainable
as
distorted
reflections
of
waking
actions
often
based
on
some
stray
thought
or
suggestion
of
the
day
and
then
comparable
to
suggestions
other
dreams
are
demonstrably
entirely
outside
the
range
of
ordinary
mental
or
physical
disturbances
actions
reflections
or
suggestions
of
the
waking
life
and
seem
thus
have
a
wider
purview
and
to
indicate
that
the
record
of
external
events
which
is
kept
within
us
is
far
fuller
than
we
know
in
some
dreams
there
is
reasoning
as
well
as
memory
and
mathematicians
have
been
known
to
solve
problems
in
sleep
an
american
inventor
known
to
the
writer
mother
asserted
that
he
had
dreamt
out
the
details
of
a
certain
process
which
proved
successful
when
tested
through
set
up
in
the
waking
state
stevenson
upon
entering
the
dream
state
secured
details
for
his
imaginary
romances
stout
himself
in
criticizing
myers
self
admits
that
some
very
rare
instances
a
man
has
achieved
while
dreaming
intellectual
performances
equalling
or
perhaps
surpassing
the
best
of
which
he
was
capable
in
waking
life
and
there
are
many
authentic
cases
of
dream
experiences
which
can
not
possibly
be
explained
as
revivals
of
facts
fallen
out
of
the
range
of
the
ordinary
memory
or
consciousness
we
seem
to
be
led
to
some
hypothesis
like
this
in
dreaming
there
is
mental
activity
which
in
the
waking
state
is
either
functionless
or
else
below
the
threshold
of
sensibility
because
much
that
is
subconscious
in
the
state
is
in
the
dream
state
fully
conscious
and
we
probably
do
not
remember
one
quarter
of
our
dreams
they
belong
to
a
mainly
different
order
of
consciousness
professor
freud
view
of
dreams
coincides
pretty
generally
with
this
view
he
holds
that
the
subconsciousness
is
the
storehouse
out
of
which
dream
contents
are
drawn
and
acted
upon
by
the
dream
mind
very
much
distortion
of
the
subconscious
material
takes
place
in
the
process
due
to
what
he
calls
the
censor
in
the
waking
state
this
censor
is
always
on
the
alert
to
keep
out
of
consciousness
all
subconscious
processes
or
deposits
but
in
sleep
the
censor
is
less
alert
and
allows
some
subconscious
content
to
escape
over
into
the
ordinary
consciousness
the
result
is
a
dream
distorted
out
of
all
recognition
of
its
origin
such
a
dream
seems
to
occupy
a
position
midway
between
what
we
have
classed
as
the
lowest
or
dream
and
the
highest
or
subliminal
dream
it
possibly
shows
an
harmonious
condition
of
the
dream
life
whereas
the
lowest
type
of
dream
shows
the
preponderance
of
the
physical
or
animal
and
the
highest
type
of
dream
shows
the
preponderance
of
the
psychical
elements
in
man
further
it
may
be
designated
as
the
normal
dream
and
the
other
two
types
respectively
as
the
physically
abnormal
and
the
psychically
abnormal
professor
freud
detects
other
marked
processes
in
the
dream
state
all
of
which
help
to
illustrate
the
part
of
the
dependent
upon
dreaming
experiences
there
is
condensation
of
details
frequently
in
a
proportion
so
great
as
one
for
ten
and
one
for
twenty
displacement
of
details
or
transvaluation
of
all
values
much
dramatization
regression
a
retrograde
movement
of
abstract
mental
processes
toward
their
primary
conceptions
and
secondary
elaboration
an
attempt
to
rationalize
all
also
professor
freud
discovered
from
his
analysis
of
thousands
of
dreams
that
the
subconsciousness
makes
use
of
a
sort
of
symbolism
symbolism
in
part
varies
with
the
individual
but
in
part
is
of
a
typical
nature
and
seems
to
be
identical
with
the
symbolism
which
we
suppose
to
lie
behind
our
myths
and
legends
it
is
not
impossible
that
these
latter
creations
of
the
people
may
find
their
explanation
from
the
study
of
dreams
such
processes
taken
as
a
whole
show
that
man
possesses
a
twofold
consciousness
the
ordinary
consciousness
and
the
subconsciousness
and
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
subconscious
activities
go
on
continually
in
waking
and
in
sleeping
by
experiments
on
his
own
perfectly
healthy
children
wienholt
proved
that
there
are
natural
forces
existing
whose
stimulations
are
never
perceived
in
waking
life
he
made
passes
over
the
face
and
neck
of
his
son
with
an
iron
key
at
the
distance
of
half
an
inch
without
touching
him
whereupon
the
boy
began
to
rub
those
parts
and
manifested
uneasiness
wienholt
likewise
experimented
on
his
other
children
with
lead
zinc
gold
and
other
metals
and
in
most
cases
the
children
the
parts
so
treated
rubbed
them
or
drew
the
clothes
over
them
therefore
in
sleep
the
consciousness
perceives
objects
without
physical
contact
and
this
not
inconceivably
might
suggest
inversely
that
in
sleep
the
human
consciousness
can
affect
objects
without
physical
contact
as
it
is
said
fairies
and
the
dead
can
and
in
the
way
psychical
researchers
know
that
objects
can
be
affected
we
have
on
record
an
account
of
a
most
remarkable
dream
quite
the
same
in
character
as
dreams
wherein
certain
celts
believe
they
have
met
the
dead
or
fairies
professor
hilprecht
had
a
broken
assyrian
cylinder
in
cuneiform
which
he
could
not
decipher
but
in
a
dream
an
assyrian
priest
in
ancient
garb
appeared
to
him
and
deciphered
the
inscription
of
this
dream
myers
observed
seem
to
have
reached
the
utmost
intensity
of
sleep
faculty
within
the
limits
of
our
ordinary
spectrum
we
may
sum
up
the
results
of
our
examination
of
dreams
by
saying
that
scientific
analysis
of
the
dream
life
its
higher
proves
that
our
ego
is
not
wholly
embraced
in
that
the
ego
exceeds
the
instead
of
a
continuity
of
consciousness
which
constitutes
we
have
parallel
states
of
consciousness
for
the
one
subject
the
ego
our
study
of
the
celtic
theory
of
in
the
following
chapter
will
further
explain
this
subtle
aspect
of
the
dream
psychology
when
such
a
conclusion
is
applied
to
the
the
various
or
states
during
which
ancient
and
contemporary
celts
testify
to
having
been
in
fairyland
are
seen
to
be
scientifically
plausible
in
this
aspect
then
fairyland
stripped
of
all
its
literary
and
imaginative
glamour
and
of
its
social
psychology
in
the
eyes
of
science
resolves
itself
into
a
reality
because
it
is
one
of
the
states
of
consciousness
with
the
ordinary
consciousness
this
statement
will
be
confirmed
by
a
brief
examination
of
what
is
called
lapse
of
time
and
which
is
invariably
connected
with
fairyland
lapse
of
it
has
already
been
made
clear
that
in
the
dream
or
somnambulic
state
there
are
invariably
modifications
of
time
and
space
relations
and
these
give
rise
to
what
has
been
termed
the
lapse
of
time
two
conditions
are
possible
either
a
few
minutes
of
time
equal
long
periods
in
the
state
or
else
as
is
usually
the
case
in
the
the
reverse
is
true
the
first
condition
which
we
shall
examine
first
occasionally
appears
in
the
through
such
a
statement
as
this
one
may
thus
go
to
faerie
for
an
hour
or
two
similarly
as
physicians
well
know
patients
under
narcotics
will
experience
events
extending
over
long
periods
of
time
within
a
few
minutes
of
normal
time
de
quincey
the
famous
records
dreams
of
ten
to
sixty
supernatural
duration
and
some
quite
beyond
all
limits
of
the
waking
experience
fechner
records
a
case
of
a
woman
who
was
nearly
drowned
and
then
resuscitated
after
two
minutes
of
unconsciousness
and
who
in
that
time
lived
over
again
all
her
past
life
another
even
more
remarkable
case
than
this
last
concerns
admiral
beaufort
who
having
fallen
into
the
water
was
unconscious
also
for
two
minutes
and
yet
he
says
that
not
only
during
that
short
space
of
time
did
he
travel
over
every
incident
of
his
life
with
the
details
of
minute
and
collateral
feature
but
that
there
crowded
into
his
imagination
trifling
events
which
had
long
been
forgotten
we
shall
now
present
examples
to
illustrate
the
second
condition
höhne
was
in
an
unbroken
magnetic
sleep
from
the
first
of
january
to
the
tenth
of
may
and
when
he
came
out
of
it
he
was
overcome
with
surprise
to
see
that
spring
had
arrived
he
having
lain
down
as
he
believed
only
the
day
before
had
höhne
been
an
irishman
he
might
very
reasonably
have
explained
the
situation
by
saying
that
he
had
been
with
the
fairies
for
what
seemed
only
a
night
the
seeress
of
prevorst
in
a
similar
sleep
passed
through
a
period
of
six
years
and
five
months
and
then
awoke
as
from
a
sleep
with
no
memory
of
what
she
did
during
that
time
but
some
time
afterwards
memory
of
the
period
came
to
her
so
completely
that
she
recalled
all
its
details
old
people
and
some
young
people
too
among
the
celts
who
go
to
fairyland
for
varying
periods
of
time
sometimes
extending
over
weeks
as
in
a
case
i
knew
in
west
ireland
have
just
such
dreams
or
as
this
another
example
follows
chardel
in
fleeing
from
the
revolution
took
ship
from
brittany
and
was
obliged
to
induce
somnambulism
on
his
wife
in
order
to
overcome
her
horror
of
the
sea
when
the
couple
landed
in
america
and
chardel
awakened
his
wife
she
had
no
recollection
whatever
of
the
atlantic
voyage
and
believed
herself
still
in
brittany
both
helmholtz
and
fechner
show
that
the
functions
of
the
nervous
system
are
associated
with
a
definite
so
it
follows
that
consciousness
in
an
organic
body
like
man
depends
upon
the
nervous
system
but
as
these
examples
and
similar
ones
in
the
show
certain
conscious
states
exist
independently
of
the
human
nerves
and
they
therefore
set
up
a
strong
presumption
that
complete
consciousness
can
exist
independently
of
the
physical
and
in
proceeding
to
submit
this
presumption
of
a
supersensuous
consciousness
to
the
further
test
of
science
we
shall
at
the
same
time
be
testing
the
statements
made
by
wholly
reliable
like
the
irish
mystic
and
seer
that
not
only
can
men
and
women
enter
fairyland
during
for
a
brief
period
but
that
at
death
they
can
enter
it
for
an
unlimited
period
further
what
is
for
our
study
the
most
important
of
all
statements
will
likewise
be
tested
namely
that
in
fairyland
there
are
conscious
entities
like
the
races
psychical
research
and
fairies
our
present
task
then
is
to
extend
the
examination
beyond
incarnate
consciousness
into
the
realm
of
the
new
psychology
or
physical
research
where
as
a
working
hypothesis
it
is
assumed
that
there
is
discarnate
consciousness
which
by
the
celtic
peoples
is
believed
to
exist
and
to
exhibit
itself
in
various
individual
aspects
as
fairies
as
to
what
science
demands
as
proof
of
the
survival
of
human
consciousness
after
death
there
has
been
no
clear
consensus
of
opinion
to
prove
merely
the
existence
of
would
not
do
it
is
necessary
to
show
by
a
series
of
proofs
that
discarnate
intelligences
exist
that
they
possess
complete
and
persistent
personal
energy
wholly
within
themselves
that
they
are
the
actual
unit
of
consciousness
and
memory
known
to
have
manifested
itself
on
this
plane
of
existence
through
particular
incarnate
personalities
now
deceased
various
psychical
researchers
assert
that
they
have
already
reached
these
proofs
and
are
convinced
often
in
spite
of
their
initial
scientific
attitude
of
antagonism
toward
all
psychic
phenomena
of
the
survival
of
the
human
consciousness
after
the
death
of
the
human
body
and
we
shall
proceed
to
present
the
testimony
of
some
of
them
in
chapter
vii
concerning
of
the
forming
part
of
frederick
myers
personality
and
its
survival
of
bodily
and
in
the
two
chapters
which
follow
on
and
on
possession
and
all
the
necessary
proofs
above
noted
have
been
adduced
and
the
author
was
thereby
one
of
the
very
first
psychical
researchers
to
have
recorded
before
the
world
his
conversion
from
the
hypothesis
to
the
ancient
belief
that
man
is
immortal
for
he
admits
his
conviction
that
the
human
consciousness
does
incontestably
survive
the
decay
of
the
physical
body
types
of
some
of
these
and
proved
cases
offered
as
evidence
by
myers
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows
repeated
apparitions
indicating
intimate
acquaintance
with
some
fact
like
the
place
of
burial
single
apparitions
with
knowledge
of
the
affairs
of
surviving
friends
or
of
the
impending
death
of
a
survivor
or
of
spirits
of
persons
dead
after
the
apparition
decease
cases
where
professed
spirits
manifest
knowledge
of
their
as
of
some
secret
compact
made
with
survivors
cases
of
apparitional
appearances
near
a
corpse
or
a
grave
occasional
cases
of
the
appearance
of
the
dead
to
several
persons
collectively
under
motor
automatism
some
of
the
most
striking
phenomena
tending
toward
proof
are
cases
where
automatic
writing
has
announced
a
death
unknown
to
the
persons
present
knowledge
communicated
in
a
not
known
to
any
person
present
but
afterwards
proved
to
have
been
possessed
by
the
deceased
automatic
writing
by
a
child
in
language
unknown
to
her
in
chapter
ix
trance
or
possession
is
defined
by
myers
in
the
same
list
of
proofs
as
development
of
motor
automatism
resulting
at
last
in
a
substitution
of
personality
and
this
harmonizes
with
the
theory
of
the
control
of
a
living
organism
by
discarnate
spirits
and
is
supported
by
an
overwhelming
mass
of
scientific
experiment
telepathy
suggests
the
possibility
of
communication
between
the
living
and
the
living
and
between
the
living
and
the
dead
and
we
may
add
between
the
dead
and
the
dead
as
in
fairyland
without
the
consideration
of
space
or
time
as
known
in
the
lower
ranges
of
mental
action
and
that
the
communication
does
not
depend
upon
vibrations
from
a
material
telepathy
in
these
first
two
aspects
has
been
likewise
accepted
as
a
scientific
fact
by
workers
in
psychical
research
like
sir
william
crookes
sir
oliver
lodge
william
james
and
by
many
others
all
such
phenomena
as
these
now
being
so
carefully
investigated
and
weighed
by
men
thoroughly
trained
in
science
are
so
to
speak
the
protoplasmic
background
of
all
religions
philosophies
or
systems
of
mystical
thought
yet
evolved
on
this
planet
and
in
all
essentials
they
confirm
the
presented
in
the
evidence
of
the
stout
an
able
representative
of
the
school
of
to
the
theories
in
psychology
propounded
by
myers
and
by
psychical
research
states
his
position
thus
at
least
my
doubt
is
not
dogmatic
denial
and
i
agree
with
myers
that
there
is
no
sufficient
reason
for
being
peculiarly
sceptical
concerning
communications
from
departed
spirits
i
also
agree
with
him
that
the
alleged
cases
of
such
communication
can
not
be
with
any
approach
to
probability
explained
away
as
mere
instances
of
telepathy
in
addition
stout
says
conception
which
has
been
really
useful
to
him
is
that
of
telepathy
given
that
communication
takes
place
between
individual
minds
unmediated
by
ordinary
physical
conditions
we
may
regard
intercourse
with
departed
spirits
as
a
special
case
of
the
same
kind
of
process
and
clairvoyance
precognition
may
perhaps
be
referred
to
telepathic
communication
either
with
departed
spirits
or
with
other
intelligences
superior
to
the
human
in
this
last
phrase
superior
to
the
human
stout
assumes
our
own
position
that
hypothetically
there
is
good
reason
for
thinking
that
discarnate
intelligences
such
as
the
irish
call
the
may
exist
and
communicate
with
or
influence
in
some
unknown
way
the
living
as
during
and
in
andrew
lang
points
out
in
his
reply
to
stout
criticism
that
the
only
legitimate
scientific
resource
for
overthrowing
position
since
the
evidence
is
incapable
of
explanation
by
chance
coincidence
is
to
say
that
several
people
are
deliberate
forgers
and
liars
and
he
adds
myself
but
only
to
myself
and
a
small
circle
the
evidence
is
irrefragable
from
our
lifetime
knowledge
of
the
percipient
but
the
animistic
position
does
not
by
any
means
depend
upon
the
evidence
presented
by
myers
no
matter
how
incontestably
reliable
it
is
we
have
only
to
examine
the
voluminous
publications
of
the
for
psychical
london
to
realize
this
and
especially
the
on
the
census
of
hallucinations
of
modern
by
professor
sidgwick
committee
london
psychical
research
and
anthropology
in
relation
to
the
to
a
special
contribution
from
andrew
andrew
lang
who
has
done
a
special
service
to
science
by
showing
that
psychical
research
is
inseparably
related
to
anthropology
has
favoured
us
with
a
statement
of
his
own
position
toward
this
relationship
and
has
made
it
directly
applicable
to
the
in
a
general
way
but
not
in
some
important
details
as
indicated
in
our
annotations
we
agree
with
lang
position
which
he
states
as
follows
evans
wentz
has
asked
me
to
define
my
position
towards
psychical
research
in
relation
to
anthropology
i
have
done
so
in
my
book
making
of
the
alleged
abnormal
or
supernormal
occurrences
which
psychical
research
examines
are
for
the
most
part
human
and
whether
they
happen
or
do
not
happen
whether
they
are
the
results
of
malobservation
or
of
fraud
or
are
merely
mythical
as
they
can
not
be
wisely
neglected
by
anthropology
the
under
many
names
in
many
tongues
are
everywhere
objects
of
human
belief
in
central
australia
in
new
zealand
in
the
isles
of
the
pacific
as
in
the
british
isles
lowland
or
highland
celtic
in
the
main
or
english
in
the
main
i
conceive
the
various
beings
fairies
brownies
or
what
you
will
be
purely
i
am
incapable
of
believing
that
they
are
actual
entities
who
carry
off
men
and
women
steal
and
hide
objects
especially
as
the
do
love
or
hate
persecute
or
kiss
human
beings
practise
music
vocal
and
instrumental
and
in
short
the
pliskies
with
which
they
are
universally
credited
by
the
identical
workings
of
the
human
fancy
they
tend
to
shade
away
on
one
side
into
the
denizens
of
the
house
of
hades
phantasms
of
the
dead
the
belief
in
such
phantasms
may
be
partially
based
on
experience
whether
hallucinatory
or
otherwise
and
inexplicably
produced
as
far
as
psychical
research
studies
report
of
these
phantasms
it
approaches
the
realm
of
fairy
queen
proserpine
as
far
as
such
research
examines
the
historical
or
contemporary
stories
of
the
it
touches
on
fairies
because
the
irish
for
example
attribute
to
the
agency
of
fairies
the
modern
phenomena
whether
these
in
each
case
be
fraudulent
or
up
to
now
be
unexplained
there
are
not
more
than
two
or
three
alleged
visions
of
the
traditional
fairies
in
the
annals
of
psychical
research
and
i
have
met
with
but
few
sane
and
educated
persons
who
profess
to
have
seen
phantoms
at
all
resembling
the
traditional
fairy
while
phantasms
supposed
to
be
of
the
dead
the
dying
and
the
absent
are
frequently
reported
on
the
whole
psychical
research
has
very
little
concern
with
the
in
its
typical
forms
and
if
the
researcher
did
find
modern
cases
of
fairy
visions
alleged
by
sane
and
educated
percipients
he
would
be
apt
to
explain
them
by
suggestion
acting
on
the
subconscious
self
marloes
road
london
concerning
phantasms
of
the
dead
into
which
as
above
pointed
out
the
tend
to
shade
away
lang
has
elsewhere
said
the
whole
if
the
evidence
is
worth
anything
there
are
real
objective
ghosts
and
there
are
also
telepathic
hallucinations
so
that
the
scientific
attitude
is
to
believe
in
both
if
in
either
and
he
shows
that
while
anthropologists
have
explained
all
animistic
beliefs
as
the
results
of
primitive
men
philosophizing
life
death
sleep
dreams
trances
shadows
the
phenomena
of
epilepsy
and
the
illusions
of
starvation
phenomena
psychological
and
psychical
might
suggest
most
of
the
animistic
beliefs
in
making
of
lang
has
expanded
this
anthropological
argument
so
as
to
make
it
even
more
fully
embrace
psychical
research
if
we
apply
the
brilliant
results
of
lang
investigations
to
our
own
it
is
apparent
that
the
background
of
the
like
that
of
all
religions
is
animistic
as
we
have
argued
in
chapter
iii
that
it
must
have
grown
up
in
ancient
times
into
its
traditional
form
out
of
a
followed
by
a
celtic
religion
these
latter
due
in
turn
to
actual
psychical
experiences
such
as
hallucinations
visions
of
different
sorts
clairvoyance
and
magical
knowledge
on
the
part
of
druid
priests
and
probably
to
some
extent
on
the
part
of
the
common
people
as
well
and
finally
that
the
living
depends
not
so
much
upon
ancient
traditions
oral
and
recorded
as
upon
recent
and
contemporary
psychical
experiences
vouched
for
by
many
and
other
percipients
among
our
witnesses
and
now
placed
on
record
by
us
in
chapter
ii
and
elsewhere
throughout
this
study
the
present
position
of
psychical
research
sir
william
crookes
the
english
authority
in
physical
science
was
almost
the
first
scientist
to
become
seriously
interested
in
psychics
and
in
part
iii
of
of
an
enquiry
into
the
phenomena
called
spiritual
during
the
years
london
boldly
affirms
will
be
seen
that
the
facts
are
of
the
most
astounding
character
and
seem
utterly
irreconcilable
with
all
known
theories
of
modern
science
having
satisfied
myself
of
their
it
would
be
moral
cowardice
to
withhold
my
testimony
because
my
previous
publications
were
ridiculed
by
critics
and
others
and
this
conclusion
reached
forty
years
ago
has
not
been
reversed
but
has
been
confirmed
by
one
after
another
of
learned
scientists
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
in
sir
oliver
lodge
principal
of
the
university
of
birmingham
and
at
present
one
of
the
best
known
of
scientists
concerned
with
the
study
of
spiritual
phenomena
stated
his
position
thus
the
whole
i
am
of
those
who
though
they
would
like
to
see
further
and
still
stronger
and
more
continued
proofs
are
of
opinion
that
a
good
case
has
been
made
out
and
that
as
the
best
working
hypothesis
at
the
present
time
it
is
legitimate
to
grant
that
lucid
moments
of
intercourse
with
deceased
persons
may
in
the
best
cases
supervene
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
the
known
and
the
unknown
is
still
substantial
but
it
is
wearing
thin
in
places
and
like
excavators
engaged
in
boring
a
tunnel
from
opposite
ends
amid
the
roar
of
water
and
other
noises
we
are
beginning
to
hear
now
and
again
the
strokes
of
the
pickaxes
of
our
comrades
on
the
other
side
in
sir
oliver
lodge
published
survival
of
in
which
after
a
careful
exposition
covering
over
three
hundred
pages
of
the
definite
results
of
much
scientific
experimentation
by
the
best
scientists
of
europe
and
america
in
such
psychical
phenomena
as
telepathy
or
thought
transference
telepathy
and
clairvoyance
automatism
and
lucidity
the
following
tentative
conclusion
is
reached
first
thing
we
learn
perhaps
the
only
thing
we
clearly
learn
in
the
first
instance
is
there
is
no
such
sudden
break
in
the
conditions
of
existence
as
may
have
been
anticipated
and
no
break
at
all
in
the
continuous
and
conscious
identity
of
genuine
character
and
personality
and
his
personal
conviction
is
that
between
other
than
embodied
human
minds
than
our
own
has
become
possible
william
james
who
was
one
of
the
chief
psychical
researchers
in
the
united
states

his
conclusions
in
october

of
psychical
phenomena
he
wrote
to
there
being
such
real
natural
types
of
phenomena
ignored
by
orthodox
science
i
am
not
baffled
at
all
for
i
am
fully
convinced
of
it
of
he
postulated
the
very
interesting
theory
of
a
universally
diffused
which
elsewhere
we
have
referred
to
as
the
scientific
equivalent
to
the
polynesian
own
dramatic
sense
tends
instinctively
to
picture
the
situation
as
an
interaction
between
slumbering
faculties
in
the
automatist
mind
and
a
cosmic
environment
of
of
some
sort
which
is
able
to
work
upon
them
if
there
were
in
the
universe
a
lot
of
diffuse
unable
of
itself
to
get
into

form

to
take

possession

always
craving

do
so
it
might
get
its
head
into
the
air
parasitically
so
to
speak
by
profiting
by
weak
spots
in
the
armour
of
human
minds

in
and

sleeping
tendencies
to
personate

this
theory
into
a
view
of
the
universe
and

of

a
bank
upon
which
we
all
draw
james
asked
these
questions
about

which
educated
celtic
seers
ask
themselves
about

how
confluent

another
may
they
become
we
should
ask
the
reader
to
compare
this
scientific
attitude
with
the
almost
identical
attitude
taken
up
with
respect
to
the
races
and

says
conclusions
of

present
work
concord
with
those
of
the
former

may
sum
up
the
whole
matter
with
the
single
statement
that
there
exists
in
nature
in
myriad
activity
a
the
essential
nature
of
which
is
still
hidden
from
us
the
final
testing
of
the
this
chapter
can
now
be
brought
to
its
logical
conclusion
by
directly
applying
the
results
so
far
attained
to
our
still
vigorous
or
residuum
gathered
out
of
the
we
have
although
hurriedly
blazed
a
rough
pathway
through
the
necessary
parts
of
the
jungle
of
scientific
theories
and
have
arrived
at
a
very
considerable
clearing
made
by
the
pioneers
the
psychical
researchers
we
seem
in
fact
to
have
arrived
at
a
point
in
our
long
investigations
where
we
can
postulate
scientifically
on
the
showing
of
the
data
of
psychical
research
the
existence
of
such
invisible
intelligences
as
gods
genii
daemons
all
kinds
of
true
fairies
and
disembodied
men
it
is
not
necessary
to
produce
here
in
addition
to
what
already
has
been
set
forth
the
very
voluminous
detailed
evidence
of
psychical
research
as
to
the
existence
of
such
intelligences
the
general
statement
may
be
made
that
there
are
hundreds
of
carefully
proven
cases
of
phenomena
or
apparitions
precisely
like
many
of
those
which
the
celtic
peoples
attribute
to
fairies
various
explanations
or
theories
are
offered
by
our
men
of
science
as
to
what
these
invisible
intelligences
are
for
none
of
our
scientists
would
say
that
the
dead
alone
are
responsible
even
in
a
majority
of
cases
for
the
observed
phenomena
and
apparitions
but
rather
such
beings
as
we
call
daemons
fairies
and
elementals
camille
flammarion
says
greater
part
of
the
phenomena
observed
noises
movement
of
tables
confusions
disturbances
raps
replies
to
questions
asked
are
really
childish
puerile
vulgar
often
ridiculous
and
rather
resemble
the
pranks
of
mischievous
boys
than
serious
actions
it
is
impossible
not
to
notice
this
why
should
the
souls
of
the
dead
amuse
themselves
in
this
way
the
supposition
seems
almost
absurd
there
could
be
no
better
description
of
the
pranks
which
fairies
like
brownies
and
robin
goodfellows
and
elementals
enjoy
than
this
and
to
suppose
that
the
dead
perform
such
mischievous
and
playful
acts
is
in
truth
absurd
flammarion
also
says
inescapable
hypotheses
present
themselves
either
it
is
we
who
produce
these
phenomena
and
this
is
not
reasonable
it
is
spirits
but
mark
this
well
these
spirits
are
not
necessarily
the
souls
of
the
dead
for
other
kinds
of
spiritual
beings
may
exist
and
space
may
be
full
of
them
without
our
ever
knowing
anything
about
it
except
under
unusual
circumstances
we
not
find
in
the
different
ancient
literatures
demons
angels
gnomes
goblins
sprites
spectres
elementals
perhaps
these
legends
are
not
without
some
foundation
in
on
phenomena
of
percussive
and
allied
sound
such
as
fairies
and
the
dead
are
said
to
produce
sir
william
crookes
made
this
report
intelligence
governing
the
phenomena
is
sometimes
manifestly
below
that
of
the
medium
it
is
frequently
in
direct
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
the
medium
the
intelligence
is
sometimes
of
such
a
character
as
to
lead
to
the
belief
that
it
does
not
emanate
from
any
person
present
in
the
case
of
the
home
sir
william
crookes
used
mechanical
tests
and
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
physical
objects
moved
without
home
or
any
other
person
being
in
contact
with
them
in
the
way
that
fairies
are
believed
to
move
objects
these
phenomena
parallel
remarkable
ancient
and
modern
examples
of
the
same
nature
in
the
affair
at
cideville
france
brought
before
a
magistrate
there
is
sworn
evidence
by
reputable
witnesses
that
pillows
and
coverlets
floated
away
from
a
bed
in
which
two
children
were
asleep
and
that
furniture
in
the
house
moved
without
contact
margaret
quinn
originally
of
mullingar
but
now
of
howth
gave
this
remarkable
testimony
i
was
a
little
girl
i
lived
with
my
mother
in
west
meath
near
mullingar
a
was
at
the
back
of
our
house
and
mother
used
to
hear
music
playing
round
our
house
all
night
and
she
has
seen
the
it
often
happened
there
at
home
that
we
would
have
clothes
out
on
the
line
and
they
would
float
off
like
a
balloon
at
a
time
when
there
would
not
be
a
bit
of
wind
and
in
daylight
my
mother
would
come
out
and
say
god
bless
the
will
bring
them
back
and
then
the
clothes
would
slowly
come
floating
back
to
the
line
and
in
our
chapter
ii
there
is
other
testimony
concerning
objects
moved
without
contact
with
human
beings
either
through
the
agency
of
fairies
or
of
the
dead
after
due
investigation
of
such
and
various
other
phenomena
sir
william
crookes
among
other
theories
to
explain
them
gives
this
theory
actions
of
a
separate
order
of
beings
living
on
this
earth
but
invisible
and
immaterial
to
us
able
however
occasionally
to
manifest
their
presence
known
in
almost
all
countries
and
ages
as
demons
not
necessarily
bad
gnomes
fairies
kobolds
elves
goblins
puck
here
we
seem
to
have
what
ought
to
be
by
this
stage
of
our
study
proof
of
the
psychological
theory
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
the
let
us
now
draw
a
few
of
the
direct
parallels
thus
suggested
consider
first
how
a
fairy
is
said
to
appear
how
it
is
described
and
how
it
vanishes
and
then
compare
the
facts
stated
in
the
following
case
of
a
phantom
reported
by
sir
william
crookes
the
dusk
of
the
evening
just
the
time
when
fairies
are
most
easily
seen
a
with
home
at
my
house
the
curtains
of
a
window
about
eight
feet
from
home
were
seen
to
move
a
dark
shadowy
form
like
that
of
a
man
was
then
seen
by
all
present
standing
near
the
window
waving
the
curtain
with
his
hand
as
we
looked
the
form
faded
away
and
the
curtain
ceased
to
move
the
following
home
as
in
the
former
case
being
the
is
a
still
more
striking
instance
phantom
form
came
from
a
corner
of
the
room
took
an
accordion
in
its
hand
and
then
glided
about
the
room
playing
the
instrument
the
form
was
visible
to
all
present
for
many
minutes
home
also
being
seen
at
the
same
time
on
its
coming
rather
close
to
a
lady
who
was
sitting
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
company
she
gave
a
slight
cry
upon
which
it
vanished
compare
the
following
types
of
observed
phenomena
by
the
same
authority
with
what
our
welsh
witness
from
the
pentre
evan
country
said
about
have
seen
a
luminous
cloud
floating
upwards
to
a
picture
or
have
more
than
once
had
a
solid
body
placed
in
my
hand
by
a
hand
which
did
not
belong
to
any
person
in
the
room
in
the
light
i
have
seen
a
luminous
cloud
hover
over
a
heliotrope
on
a
break
a
sprig
off
and
carry
the
sprig
to
a
lady
and
on
some
occasions
i
have
seen
a
similar
luminous
cloud
visibly
condense
to
the
form
of
a
hand
and
carry
small
objects
about
similar
lights
parallel
to
the
death
lights
or
death
tokens
observed
by
celtic
percipients
in
wales
and
in
brittany
and
to
what
in
ireland
are
called
the
of
the
people
or
all
of
which
phenomena
are
traceable
to
no
material
causes
as
yet
discovered
are
reported
by
iamblichus
and
others
of
his
school
and
such
lights
are
among
phenomena
best
attested
by
modern
psychical
researchers
supernormally
produced
music
said
to
have
been
produced
by
daemons
which
is
parallel
to
that
called
by
several
of
our
own
percipients
music
was
also
known
to
the
and
in
the
scientific
investigations
to
which
home
was
subjected
musical
sounds
were
heard
which
could
not
be
attributed
to
any
known
agency
in
haunted
houses
as
psychical
research
discovers
the
rustling
of
dresses
movements
of
objects
and
sounds
often
occur
spontaneously
without
and
with
the
occurrence
of
apparitions
and
these
phenomena
are
parallel
to
certain
ones
which
we
have
had
cited
by
celtic
percipients
as
due
to
fairies
lang
too
has
set
forth
clearly
the
probability
of
real
or
spirits
possessing
particular
places
just
as
fairies
are
said
to
possess
particular
localities
or
buildings
in
celtic
lands
report
on
the
census
of
by
professor
committee
has
furnished
data
sufficiently
good
to
convince
many
scientists
that
phantoms
comparable
in
a
way
with
irish
banshees
and
the
breton
do
appear
to
the
living
directly
before
a
death
as
though
announcing
it
according
to
other
equally
reliable
data
sometimes
a
phantasmal
voice
like
certain
voices
has
given
news
of
a
death
myers
and
others
have
studied
and
recorded
many
cases
of
the
dead
appearing
as
the
celtic
dead
appear
when
they
have
been
to
fairyland
in
of
the
by
gurney
myers
and
podmore
the
explanation
of
apparitions
which
are
coincident
with
a
death
as
being
generated
by
a
telepathic
influence
exerted
upon
the
percipient
by
the
dying
friend
suggests
the
most
rational
interpretation
of
certain
parallel
kinds
of
apparitions
of
the
dead
or
of
fairies
who
as
in
these
last
examples
appear
dressed
in
garments
it
is
that
all
such
apparitional
appearances
coincident
with
a
death
or
not
are
equally
due
to
a
telepathic
force
exerted
by
an
agency
independent
of
the
percipient
this
outside
force
acts
as
a
stimulus
upon
the
nervous
apparatus
of
the
person
to
whom
it
is
thus
transmitted
and
causes
him
to
project
out
of
some
part
of
his
own
consciousness
which
part
may
have
passed
over
into
the
subconsciousness
a
visualized
image
already
impressed
there
the
image
has
natural
affinity
or
correspondence
with
the
outside
stimulus
which
arouses
it
such
an
hypothesis
curiously
agrees
in
part
with
the
one
put
forth
by
our
the
irish
mystic
he
would
probably
agree
as
to
the
visualization
process
in
most
types
of
ordinary
apparitions
in
addition
he
holds
that
nature
herself
has
a
memory
there
is
some
indefinable
psychic
element
in
the
earth
atmosphere
upon
which
all
human
and
physical
actions
or
phenomena
are
photographed
or
impressed
these
records
in
nature
mind
correspond
to
mental
impressions
in
us
under
certain
inexplicable
conditions
normal
persons
who
are
not
seers
may
observe
nature
mental
records
like
pictures
cast
upon
a
screen
often
like
moving
pictures
seers
can
always
see
them
if
they
wish
and
uncritical
seers
frequently
mistake
these
phantom
records
or
pictures
existing
on
the
psychical
envelope
of
the
planet
for
actual
events
now
occurring
and
for
actual
beings
fairies
of
various
kinds
and
the
dead
a
recent
book
entitled
by
elizabeth
morison
and
frances
lamont
pseudonyms
adequately
illustrates
what
we
mean
by
such
phantom
pictures
during
the
year
these
two
cultured
ladies
saw
at
petit
of
marie
antoinette
records
in
the
mind
of
nature
of
past
historical
events
dating
from
about
of
this
there
seems
not
to
be
the
slightest
doubt
the
fairy
on
lough
gur
as
described
by
count
john
de
salis
and
the
procession
seen
on
tara
hill
of
fairies
soldiers
of
ancient
ireland
in
review
probably
illustrate
the
same
kind
of
phenomena
cf
pp
but
in
visions
by
natural
seers
following
again
the
theory
of
our
irish
there
is
present
not
only
an
outside
force
as
seems
to
be
the
case
when
ordinary
apparitions
are
seen
but
also
a
veridical
being
with
a
form
and
life
of
its
own
in
a
world
of
its
own
such
a
real
entity
is
as
distinct
from
a
picture
in
the
memory
of
nature
as
a
living
person
is
distinct
from
the
mental
picture
which
his
friend
holds
and
projects
as
a
visualized
image
when
responding
to
a
telepathic
stimulus
sent
by
him
the
natural
seer
not
being
obliged
to
see
with
his
normal
sense
of
vision
need
not
use
the
normal
method
namely
visualization
of
responding
to
the
outside
telepathic
stimulus
and
so
does
not
see
the
ordinary
apparitional
ghost
or
fairy
he
exercises
or
ecstatic
vision
and
while
so
doing
is
in
the
same
plane
of
consciousness
and
under
the
same
conditions
of
perception
as
the
intelligence
which
projects
upon
him
the
stimulus
inducing
automatically
such
or
ecstatic
vision
therefore
if
the
intelligence
has
a
form
and
nature
of
its
own
the
seer
and
not
the
will
perceive
them
in
their
own
world
while
his
consciousness
is
temporarily
functioning
there
and
out
of
the
normal
plane
of
mental
action
in
other
words
in
the
normal
plane
the
reacts
normally
upon
the
same
stimulus
upon
which
the
seer
reacts
abnormally
the
former
percipient
sees
a
apparition
a
visualized
image
out
of
his
own
experience
the
latter
claims
to
see
a
real
being
the
real
being
exists
normally
under
conditions
which
are
abnormal
to
the
but
which
to
the
seer
become
normal
the
visualization
of
the
is
a
makeshift
a
reaction
to
a
purely
psychical
stimulus
it
is
mathematically
possible
to
conceive
beings
and
if
they
exist
it
would
be
impossible
in
a
plane
to
see
them
as
they
really
are
hence
the
ordinary
apparition
is
as
a
form
whereas
the
beings
which
wholly
sane
and
reliable
seers
claim
to
see
when
exercising
seership
of
the
highest
kind
may
be
as
real
to
themselves
and
to
the
seers
as
human
beings
are
to
us
here
in
this
world
when
we
exercise
normal
vision
concerning
actual
which
among
spiritualists
and
psychical
researchers
would
be
called
spirit
phenomena
through
and
which
as
we
have
elsewhere
pointed
out
pp
ff
offers
the
most
rational
explanation
for
the
changeling
belief
and
related
celtic
beliefs
about
fairies
nevius
in
his
offers
very
important
scientific
data
relating
to
china
ellinwood
who
like
that
authority
studied
strange
psychical
phenomena
in
the
interior
districts
of
the
shantung
province
china
for
many
years
says
in
an
introductory
note
to
that
work
to
any
knowledge
of
the
new
testament
so
full
of
cases
of
people
of
north
china
believed
fully
in
the
possession
of
the
minds
and
bodies
of
men
by
evil
spirits
it
has
always
been
understood
that
the
personality
of
the
evil
spirit
usurped
or
for
the
time
being
supplanted
that
of
the
unwilling
victim
and
acted
through
his
organs
and
faculties
physical
suffering
and
sometimes
violent
paroxysms
attended
the
presence
and
active
influence
of
the
spirit
in
the
face
of
so
many
cases
of
such
phenomena
observed
in
china
by
the
same
authorities
ellinwood
adds
as
conclusion
that
theory
has
been
advanced
which
so
well
accords
with
the
facts
as
the
simple
and
unquestioning
conclusion
so
universally
held
by
the
christians
of
shantung
viz
that
evil
spirits
do
in
many
instances
possess
or
control
the
mind
and
will
of
human
beings
hypnotism
shows
how
one
strong
and
magnetic
human
will
can
control
the
mind
and
will
of
its
subject
the
scientific
results
attained
by
the
society
for
psychical
research
in
its
study
of
spiritualism
show
a
disembodied
will
or
intelligence
controlling
and
using
the
body
of
a
living
human
being
and
nevius
writes
may
not
be
only
a
different
a
more
advanced
form
of
hypnotism
criminal
records
of
europe
and
america
show
many
examples
of
condemned
criminals
who
confessed
in
all
sincerity
that
some
invisible
or
outside
influence
led
them
against
their
better
judgement
to
commit
crime
and
very
often
in
such
examples
the
past
lives
of
the
condemned
are
so
good
as
to
set
up
a
strong
probability
in
favour
of
their
belief
in
possession
and
altogether
in
accord
with
the
evidence
of
modern
mediumship
as
well
as
that
of
mediumship
among
the
ancients
nevius
says
of
chinese
normal
consciousness
is
restored
after
one
of
these
attacks
the
subject
is
entirely
ignorant
of
everything
which
has
passed
during
that
state
the
most
striking
characteristic
of
those
cases
is
that
the
subject
evidences
another
personality
and
the
normal
personality
for
the
time
being
is
partially
or
wholly
dormant
the
new
personality
presents
traits
of
character
utterly
different
from
those
which
really
belong
to
the
subject
in
his
normal
state
and
this
change
of
character
is
with
rare
exceptions
in
the
direction
of
moral
obliquity
and
impurity
many
persons
while
give
evidence
of
knowledge
which
can
not
be
accounted
for
in
ordinary
ways
they
sometimes
converse
in
foreign
languages
of
which
in
their
normal
states
they
are
entirely
ignorant
there
are
often
heard
in
connexion
with
demon
possessions
rappings
and
noises
in
places
where
no
physical
cause
for
them
can
be
found
and
tables
chairs
crockery
and
the
like
are
moved
about
without
so
far
as
can
be
discerned
any
application
of
physical
force
exactly
as
we
are
told
is
the
case
among
spiritualists
conclusion
our
investigations
and
far
more
exhaustive
ones
than
ours
touching
similar
psychical
phenomena
show
when
applied
to
the
residuum
or
these
chief
results
the
materialistic
and
the
delusion
and
imposture
theories
can
be
dismissed
as
not
affecting
it
authorities
do
not
agree
in
their
opinions
as
to
the
pathological
and
psychological
processes
with
which
we
are
directly
concerned
they
are
quite
uncertain
how
to
explain
the
human
brain
in
all
its
more
subtle
functions
or
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
and
nervous
states
generally
in
relation
especially
to
human
consciousness
under
various
abnormal
but
not
diseased
conditions
of
the
organism
and
they
do
not
propose
any
conclusions
as
final
but
only
as
very
weakly
tentative
though
some
of
these
are
in
favour
of
a
view
of
man
in
which
there
is
a
close
approach
to
the
present
more
advanced
position
of
psychical
research
psychical
research
has
furnished
proof
sufficient
to
convince
such
scientists
as
sir
william
crookes
sir
oliver
lodge
william
james
camille
flammarion
and
others
that
states
of
consciousness
exist
in
nature
outside
of
though
probably
connected
with
the
consciousness
of
incarnate
human
beings
and
that
these
intelligences
can
produce
effects
on
matter
and
on
the
psychical
constitution
of
man
and
some
of
these
scientists
consider
certain
of
such
intelligences
to
be
discarnate
men
and
women
scientific
proof
has
been
adduced
that
there
are
genuine
hallucinations
like
those
relating
to
fairies
of
forms
seen
by
single
percipients
or
collectively
and
such
collective
hallucinations
are
incapable
of
being
explained
away
which
is
equally
true
of
apparitions
seen
by
a
single
percipient
to
move
physical
objects
many
of
the
foremost
psychical
researchers
including
those
named
above
accept
or
as
the
best
working
hypothesis
to
explain
automatism
in
the
accepted
theory
of
telepathy
we
have
support
for
assuming
that
like
hypnosis
it
is
a
psychical
process
and
can
be
carried
on
either
by
two
embodied
spirits
or
human
beings
or
by
a
disembodied
spirit
and
one
still
incarnate
myers
theories
including
that
of
the
subliminal
self
embody
all
the
preceding
ones
and
agree
in
details
with
them
the
results
taken
together
harmonize
with
those
attained
in
our
study
of
psychical
phenomena
attributed
by
the
celtic
peoples
to
fairies
and
if
they
be
accepted
older
psychological
and
pathological
theories
must
be
thoroughly
revised
in
many
cases
or
else
cast
aside
as
worthless
finally
since
we
have
demonstrated
that
the
background
of
the
and
hence
the
residuum
or
of
it
is
like
the
background
of
all
religious
and
mystical
beliefs
being
animistic
and
like
them
has
grown
up
in
ancient
times
out
of
definite
psychical
phenomena
identical
in
character
with
those
now
studied
by
science
and
is
kept
alive
by
an
unbroken
succession
of
and
percipients
we
have
a
clear
right
to
set
up
under
scientific
authority
these
tentative
conclusions
fairyland
exists
as
a
supernormal
state
of
consciousness
into
which
men
and
women
may
enter
temporarily
in
dreams
trances
or
in
various
ecstatic
conditions
or
for
an
indefinite
period
at
death
fairies
exist
because
in
all
essentials
they
appear
to
be
the
same
as
the
intelligent
forces
now
recognized
by
psychical
researchers
be
they
thus
collective
units
of
consciousness
like
what
william
james
has
called
or
more
individual
units
like
veridical
apparitions
our
examination
of
living
children
said
to
have
been
changed
by
fairies
shows
see
pp
that
many
changelings
are
so
called
merely
because
of
some
bodily
deformity
or
because
of
some
abnormal
mental
or
pathological
characteristics
capable
of
an
ordinary
rational
explanation
but
that
other
changelings
who
exhibit
a
change
of
personality
such
as
is
recognized
by
psychologists
are
in
many
cases
best
explained
on
the
theory
which
is
a
scientific
hypothesis
therefore
since
the
residuum
or
of
the
the
of
the
celtic
peoples
can
not
be
explained
away
by
any
known
scientific
laws
it
must
for
the
present
stand
and
the
psychological
theory
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
the
belief
in
fairies
in
celtic
countries
is
to
be
considered
as
hypothetically
established
in
the
eyes
of
science
hence
we
must
cease
to
look
upon
the
term
as
being
always
a
synonym
for
something
fanciful
absurd
we
must
also
cease
to
think
of
the
as
being
no
more
than
a
fabric
of
groundless
beliefs
in
short
the
ordinary
mind
must
readjust
itself
to
a
new
set
of
phenomena
which
through
ignorance
on
its
part
it
has
been
content
to
disregard
and
to
treat
with
ridicule
and
contempt
as
so
much
outworn

iv
modern
science
and
the
and
conclusions
chapter
xii
the
celtic
doctrine
of
and
otherworld
scientifically
examined
all
things
which
partook
of
life
were
to
die
and
after
they
were
dead
remained
in
the
form
of
death
and
did
not
come
to
life
again
all
would
at
last
die
and
nothing
would
be
alive
what
other
result
could
there
be
socrates
as
reported
by
plato
soul
if
immortal
existed
before
our
birth
what
is
incorruptible
must
be
hume
there
be
no
reasons
to
suppose
that
we
have
existed
before
that
period
at
which
our
existence
apparently
commences
then
there
are
no
grounds
for
supposing
that
we
shall
continue
to
exist
after
our
existence
has
apparently
shelley
the
extension
of
the
terms
fairy
and
fairyland
the
real

as
an
invisible
force
acting
through
a
a

essential
for

furnishes
clearest
illustrations
no
without
resurrection
as
the
circle
of
life
the
mystical
corollary
conclusion
the
celtic
doctrine
of
and
otherworld
is
essentially
scientific
in
the
esoteric
the
terms
fairy
and
fairyland
attain
their
broadest
meaning
to
the
celtic
mystic
the
universe
is
divisible
into
two
interpenetrating
parts
or
aspects
the
visible
in
which
we
are
now
and
the
invisible
which
is
fairyland
or
the
otherworld
and
a
fairy
is
an
intelligent
being
either
embodied
as
a
member
of
the
human
race
or
else
resident
in
the
otherworld
the
latter
class
includes
many
distinct
hierarchies
and
lower
orders
some
like
the
highest
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
who
are
the
same
in
character
as
the
gods
of
the
greeks
and
hindoos
are
superhuman
others
are
the
souls
of
the
dead
while
many
are
subhuman
and
have
never
been
embodied
in
gross
physical
bodies
these
last
include
daemons
incorrectly
regarded
by
christian
and
other
theologies
as
being
in
all
cases
evil
and
called
demons
and
other
like
spirits
such
as
those
which
tylor
in
has
designated
nature
spirits
leprechauns
pixies
knockers
elves
generally
and
their
counterparts
in
all
which
are
the
elementals
of
mediaeval
mystics
in
the
preceding
chapter
chiefly
the
lower
species
of
fairies
were
under
consideration
but
now
the
higher
orders
including
human
souls
embodied
and
disembodied
in
their
relation
toward
one
another
are
to
be
considered
independently
it
becomes
necessary
then
to
present
here
a
view
of
life
and
death
not
yet
scientifically
orthodox
the
celt
in
all
ages
of
his
long
history
like
the
ancient
greek
thinkers
with
whom
his
ancestors
were
contemporary
has
always
been
inclined
unlike
modern
scientists
to
seek
an
explanation
for
the
phenomena
of
evolutionary
life
by
postulating
a
noumenal
world
of
causes
as
the
background
of
the
phenomenal
world
of
effects
the
rapid
march
of
scientific
pioneers
chiefly
those
in
psychical
research
is
bringing
our
own
cold
and
exact
science
very
close
to
that
indefinable
boundary
which
separates
the
two
worlds
and
for
that
reason
alone
a
presentation
of
the
celtic
theory
of
the
causes
operating
to
produce
death
and
birth
will
be
at
least
by
way
of
suggestion
of
some
value
facts
of
common
everyday
knowledge
are
apt
to
lose
their
significance
through
too
great
familiarity
a
fact
of
this
character
is
that
when
each
child
is
born
it
must
awaken
into
life
often
it
is
not
known
whether
the
babe
is
dead
or
alive
until
it
stretches
forth
its
arms
and
breathes
or
cries
and
this
phenomenon
of
our
first
awakening
and
entry
upon
the
visible
plane
of
life
and
conscious
action
seems
to
corroborate
what
the
early
celt
who
thoughtfully
observed
it
held
to
be
true
and
what
the
celt
of
holds
to
be
true
that
the
material
substance
composing
the
body
of
man
is
merely
a
means
of
expression
for
life
a
conductor
for
an
unknown
force
which
exhibits
volition
and
individual
consciousness
just
as
material
substance
in
a
condition
called
inanimate
is
a
conductor
for
another
unknown
force
called
electricity
which
does
not
exhibit
any
volition
or
consciousness
destroy
the
human
body
and
there
is
no
manifestation
of
its
life
force
destroy
a
wire
and
there
is
no
manifestation
of
electric
light
the
human
body
seems
to
be
merely
incidental
in
the
history
of
the
individual
consciousness
as
a
wire
is
incidental
to
electric
light
but
is
this
consciousness
of
man
which
we
call
life
simply
a
phenomenon
of
matter
without
a
physical
means
of
expression
or
does
it
like
electricity
after
the
wire
is
destroyed
continue
to
exist
in
an
unmanifested
state
when
the
human
body
is
cold
and
motionless
in
death
and
in
the
case
of
a
child
born
dead
has
this
consciousness
found
some
organic
imperfection
in
the
infant
body
which
made
its
manifestation
impossible
a
few
thoughts
to
aid
in
answering
these
questions
will
probably
suggest
themselves
if
we
briefly
consider
the
great
difference
between
a
human
body
in
life
and
a
human
body
in
death
in
life
there
is
the
highly
organized
delicately
adjusted
perfectly
balanced
human
body
responding
to
the
will
of
an
invisible
power
and
it
is
admitted
by
all
schools
of
philosophers
moralists
and
scientists
that
this
invisible
power
whatever
it
may
be
is
the
real
man
this
invisible
power
beginning
its
manifestation
through
a
microscopic
bit
of
gradually
builds
for
itself
a
more
and
more
complex
physical
habitation
until
after
the
short
space
of
nine
months
it
claims
membership
among
the
ranks
of
men
during
the
many
years
of
its
sojourn
on
our
planet
it
renews
its
habitation
many
times
every
atom
it
began
with
in
childhood
is
discarded
and
replaced
by
a
new
one
long
before
the
age
of
manhood
is
reached
and
yet
upon
reaching
manhood
the
invisible
power
remembers
what
it
did
in
a
child
frame
this
indicates
that
memory
or
consciousness
as
a
psychical
process
does
not
depend
essentially
upon
a
material
brain
nor
upon
a
certain
grouping
of
for
if
it
did
apparently
it
would
slowly
and
imperceptibly
undergo
change
as
completely
as
the
whole
physical
body
and
brain
this
physiological
process
furnishes
sufficient
data
to
allow
us
to
postulate
that
there
is
a
psychical
organ
of
memory
behind
the
physical
and
that
such
an
organ
in
itself
is
at
least
during
a
period
unchanging
in
its
composition
without
such
an
organ
the
process
of
memory
when
more
fully
analysed
in
a
way
we
can
not
here
attempt
is
inexplicable
the
simplest
hypothesis
is
to
conceive
that
organ
as
the
one
connected
with
the
subconsciousness
or
by
means
of
which
the
invisible
power
or
rememberer
is
able
to
remember
and
to
impress
its
memory
upon
the
temporary
and
continually
unstable
physical
brain
in
the
process
of
memory
there
must
be
first
of
all
a
thing
to
be
remembered
second
a
record
of
that
thing
to
be
remembered
and
third
something
to
remember
that
thing
the
thing
remembered
is
the
result
of
a
conscious
experience
the
record
of
it
the
result
of
its
impress
at
the
time
it
was
experienced
but
the
rememberer
is
neither
that
invisible
power
which
we
have
called
the
real
man
animates
the
body
it
places
food
in
it
as
fuel
to
produce
animal
heat
animal
vitality
and
force
and
tries
to
keep
it
in
good
working
order
as
long
as
possible
if
the
body
is
imperfect
at
birth
or
becomes
so
later
that
invisible
power
is
forced
to
act
through
it
imperfectly
if
the
brain
is
diseased
there
is
insanity
if
undeveloped
idiocy
and
when
the
body
ceases
to
respond
either
perfectly
or
imperfectly
the
invisible
power
must
surrender
it
entirely
and
there
is
what
we
call
death
now
what
is
this
invisible
power
or
force
which
has
entirely
vanished
leaving
the
physical
body
and
brain
cold
and
motionless
let
us
see
if
there
is
an
answer
chemical
analysis
proves
that
the
visible
parts
of
the
body
of
man
are
merely
transformed
gases
but
in
a
complete
analysis
of
a
living
body
such
as
man
there
are
certain
elements
to
be
considered
which
are
always
invisible
thus
at
death
there
is
instantly
a
cessation
of
all
bodily
consciousness
of
all
willing
thinking
movement
the
power
which
has
made
the
body
conscious
and
which
can
not
be
compared
to
any
known
form
of
matter
is
entirely
gone
but
there
is
left
in
the
body
a
moment
after
its
departure
everything
which
we
know
to
be
material
the
animal
heat
the
animal
magnetism
the
animal
vitality
when
these
are
gone
the
body
is
cold
and
stiff
and
in
no
essential
way
unlike
any
other
mass
of
inert
matter
if
heat
be
applied
to
the
body
or
magnetism
or
vital
forces
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
retain
them
any
more
than
there
would
be
in
a
stone
the
real
man
is
gone
then
the
body
begins
to
disintegrate
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
and
the
indestructibility
of
matter
makes
it
certain
that
in
the
process
of
death
nothing
has
been
lost
certainly
nothing
material
the
animal
heat
has
gone
off
somewhere
in
the
atmosphere
or
in
some
other
matter
the
animal
magnetism
and
vitality
are
momentarily
lost
sight
of
but
soon
they
will
be
attached
to
other
organic
beings
such
as
plants
or
animals
to
begin
a
new
cycle
of
embodiment
the
physical
constituents
of
the
body
will
go
to
their
appropriate
places
into
the
air
as
gases
into
the
water
as
fluids
into
the
earth
as
salts
and
minerals
and
in
a
short
time
may
form
the
parts
of
a
flower
or
fruit
or
animal
but
where
or
what
is
the
willing
the
thinking
the
remembering
the
directing
force
which
once
controlled
all
these
and
held
them
together
in
unity
rays
are
invisible
but
they
show
their
existence
through
their
chemical
action
similarly
a
soul
or
ego
may
exist
invisibly
and
show
its
existence
through
the
vital
and
physical
unity
manifested
by
a
living
human
being
as
we
have
already
seen
in
the
preceding
chapter
there
are
a
number
of
the
first
men
of
science
who
feel
that
when
all
the
data
of
the
latest
scientific
discoveries
in
the
realm
of
psychology
and
of
psychical
research
are
impartially
examined
there
is
no
escape
from
some
such
hypothesis
as
the
ancient
hypothesis
of
a
soul
if
we
accept
the
soul
hypothesis
as
it
seems
we
must
and
regard
a
soul
as
an
indestructible
unit
of
invisible
power
possessing
consciousness
and
volition
and
normally
able
to
exist
independently
of
a
human
body
then
it
becomes
a
logical
and
a
scientific
necessity
to
postulate
its
because
as
such
a
unit
it
is
indestructible
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
and
indestructibility
of
matter
we
speak
here
not
of
the
ordinary
soul
or
human
personal
consciousness
but
of
that
ego
which
celtic
mystics
conceive
as
the
permanent
principle
though
probably
itself
relative
to
some
still
higher
power
behind
the
personality
which
in
turn
they
believe
is
a
temporary
combination
wholly
dependent
upon
the
ego
accordingly
it
is
scientifically
possible
for
such
a
soul
as
a
homogeneous
unit
of
force
or
conscious
energy
to
pass
from
one
mass
of
matter
or
physical
body
to
another
without
disintegration
diminution
or
loss
of
its
own
identity
it
is
scientifically
certain
also
from
experiments
performed
to
test
the
power
of
resistance
to
decomposition
exhibited
by
the
force
which
we
call
life
in
an
organic
body
that
such
a
force
is
capable
of
outwearing
many
physical
embodiments
recent
demonstrations
tend
to
show
that
the
heredity
hypothesis
can
not
be
held
to
account
fully
for
such
widely
varied
character
or
soul
individuality
as
may
be
exhibited
by
members
of
one
family
we
must
therefore
account
for
mental
moral
and
certainly
psychical
inequalities
among
our
race
by
some
other
hypothesis
and
no
hypothesis
is
more
scientific
more
in
line
with
known
physiological
and
psychical
processes
or
more
in
accord
with
the
law
of
evolution
than
that
of
the
theory
of
the
mechanical
transmission
of
acquired
characteristics
in
a
purely
physical
manner
through
the
is
no
longer
tenable
when
all
the
data
of
physiology
and
psychology
are
admitted
a
vitalistic
view
of
evolution
is
rapidly
developing
in
the
scientific
world
and
the
weight
of
evidence
is
decidedly
in
favour
of
regarding
all
evolutionary
processes
reaching
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
organisms
as
illustrating
a
gradual
unfolding
in
the
sensuous
world
of
a
psychical
power
through
an
complexity
of
specialized
structures
this
complexity
being
brought
about
by
natural
selection
such
a
view
is
also
strongly
supported
if
not
confirmed
by
the
general
scientific
belief
that
spontaneous
generation
of
life
is
and
always
has
been
impossible
on
our
planet
or
on
any
planet
there
must
have
been
life
before
its
physical
manifestation
or
its
physical
evolution
began
we
may
regard
this
psychical
power
as
like
a
vast
reservoir
of
consciousness
ever
trying
to
force
itself
through
matter
the
walls
of
the
reservoir
through
the
microscopic
body
of
an
amoeba
there
has
percolated
a
very
minute
drop
from
the
reservoir
as
evolution
advances
the
walls
of
the
reservoir
become
more
and
more
porous
and
little
by
little
the
drop
increases
to
a
tiny
rivulet
through
the
higher
animals
the
tiny
rivulet
flows
as
a
brook
through
man
as
he
is
the
brook
flows
as
a
deep
and
broad
river
throughout
the
completely
evolved
man
of
the
far
distant
future
the
deep
and
broad
river
will
have
overflowed
all
its
banks
it
will
have
inundated
and
completely
overwhelmed
the
nature
of
the
individual
through
whom
it
flows
as
the
whole
volume
of
the
vast
reservoir
pours
itself
out
the
ordinary
consciousness
of
man
will
then
have
been
transmuted
into
the
subconsciousness
of
which
it
had
always
been
a
pale
reflection
in
other
words
if
the
theory
of
the
mechanical
transmission
of
acquired
characteristics
has
failed
as
seems
to
be
the
case
then
we
must
assume
that
there
is
as
the
bearer
of
all
gains
made
from
generation
to
generation
some
sort
of
psychical
or
vitalistic
principle
this
making
use
of
the
merely
as
a
physical
basis
for
its
manifestation
begins
to
build
up
a
body
suited
to
its
further
evolutionary
needs
the
brilliant
discoveries
of
jacques
loeb
and
of
yves
delage
have
demolished
absolutely
the
old
idea
that
each
organ
and
each
tissue
contained
in
embryo
in
the
normal
must
develop
in
a
particular
and
way
into
a
normal
organism
and
after
the
parental
type
it
is
possible
to
make
a
head
grow
where
there
ought
to
be
feet
and
at
zürich
standfuss
solely
through
changing
the
temperature
of
his
laboratory
was
able
to
obtain
from
the
same
species
of
butterfly
forms
which
were
tropical
and
forms
which
were
arctic
all
this
helps
to
establish
the
hypothesis
which
amounts
to
certainty
that
the
conformation
of
a
physical
body
or
even
the
kind
of
species
to
be
born
is
directly
determined
by
physical
environment
and
not
by
heredity
and
that
the
chief
factor
to
consider
in
organisms
is
the
life
animating
the
body
physical
environment
affects
only
the
physical
organism
it
does
not
affect
the
invisible
and
unknown
resident
within
the
physical
organism
the
process
of
fertilization
is
a
physical
process
as
such
it
is
simply
initiatory
to
embryonic
evolution
which
also
is
physical
once
the
proper
physical
conditions
are
set
up
by
the
parents
life
pursues
its
marvellous
progress
in
the
womb
of
the
human
mother
from
the
initial
embryo
to
man
that
is
to
say
parents
set
in
motion
the
laws
governing
the
reproduction
of
physical
bodies
they
create
such
conditions
as
enable
the
invisible
to
begin
its
physical
manifestation
in
the
two
fused
germs
from
the
parents
resides
the
physical
inheritance
of
the
offspring
to
be
outwardly
shaped
by
environment
but
the
physical
inheritance
is
a
thing
distinct
from
the
psychical
part
of
the
living
being
just
as
much
as
the
dead
human
body
is
a
thing
apart
from
the
life
which
has
left
it
though
the
old
heredity
theory
is
overthrown
by
late
discoveries
the
question
as
to
what
life
is
in
human
bodies
under
all
possible
environmental
conditions
remains
unsolved
and
so
do
the
questions
why
there
should
be
sports
in
nature
which
among
man
are
called
geniuses
and
why
every
human
being
has
a
distinct
and
highly
developed
individual
character
essentially
unlike
that
of
his
immediate
ancestors
embryology
proves
conclusively
that
the
human
embryo
retraces
in
its
growth
the
evolution
of
lower
at
first
consisting
of
two
single
cells
fused
into
one
it
is
like
the
amoeba
by
it
grows
and
progresses
step
by
step
through
each
lower
realm
of
being
until
it
comes
to
be
a
with
gills
and
science
teaches
that
all
organic
life
on
this
planet
once
dwelt
in
the
seas
it
grows
progressively
out
of
the
stage
of
organic
life
into
the
world
of
creatures
nature
at
last
achieves
her
highest
product
and
a
human
being
is
born
out
of
the
womb
of
time
the
initial
microscopic
bit
of
is
endowed
with
power
of
motion
thought
and
human
consciousness
with
dominion
over
all
the
lower
kingdoms
through
which
by
right
of
ancient
conquests
it
passed
in
the
brief
period
of
nine
months
on
every
side
the
problem
of
life
is
full
of
poetry
and
wonder
it
is
the
greatest
mystery
not
only
can
we
thus
study
the
evolution
of
the
physical
man
but
we
have
recently
acquired
sufficient
scientific
data
to
lay
foundations
for
a
study
of
the
evolution
of
the
psychical
man
thus
for
example
instincts
seem
to
be
nothing
more
than
habits
which
through
unknown
periods
of
time
have
become
so
ingrained
in
the
constitution
of
man
and
of
all
animals
that
now
they
have
become
second
nature
and
usually
are
exercised
without
the
need
of
reasoning
processes
the
influence
from
innate
sensuous
experiences
rises
into
consciousness
as
the
life
of
every
normal
child
and
youth
unfolds
itself
and
these
experiences
in
their
full
expansion
when
the
age
of
maturity
has
been
reached
constitute
in
their
unity
what
we
call
character
which
in
one
sense
may
be
defined
as
the
sum
total
of
instincts
of
every
kind
from
such
a
point
of
view
the
psychical
or
invisible
power
in
man
is
merely
a
bundle
of
acquired
habits
which
make
use
of
the
bodily
organism
in
order
to
express
themselves
in
the
same
way
as
we
have
pointed
out
that
electrical
forces
manifest
their
presence
through
a
conductor
if
these
habits
be
good
we
call
their
possessor
a
good
man
if
evil
we
call
him
an
evil
man
the
theory
of
charles
darwin
suggests
that
all
evolutionary
progress
is
directed
to
the
acquirement
of
newer
and
ever
higher
instincts
and
if
this
process
be
the
true
one
that
is
to
say
if
all
instincts
which
in
their
finer
distinctions
mark
off
species
from
species
in
all
animal
kingdoms
be
as
darwin
thought
and
as
is
more
clearly
evident
the
result
of
a
long
and
gradual
evolution
through
experience
in
a
sensuous
realm
of
existence
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
a
monad
probably
a
one
to
which
such
acquired
instincts
can
attach
themselves
such
a
monad
too
must
have
been
a
percipient
and
hence
a
recorder
of
such
experiences
throughout
an
inconceivably
long
chain
of
lives
and
it
of
itself
must
while
so
perceiving
and
recording
not
be
subject
to
the
transitoriness
of
the
sensuous
realm
wherein
it
gathers
together
these
instincts
which
in
their
unified
expression
form
its
personality
or
human
character
in
harmony
with
the
vitalistic
view
of
evolution
which
implies
a
psychical
power
continually
striving
to
express
itself
completely
through
matter
yet
normally
able
to
exist
independently
of
a
physical
means
of
expression
we
should
regard
such
high
mental
processes
as
judgement
reasoning
analysis
and
synthesis
and
spatial
perception
along
with
memory
as
resultants
of
very
great
experience
in
a
sensuous
world
on
which
in
our
present
constitution
such
processes
appear
to
have
direct
bearing
in
other
words
for
man
to
be
able
to
exercise
such
high
mental
processes
there
is
need
to
postulate
incalculable
ages
of
specialization
in
the
nervous
apparatus
and
in
adjustment
of
a
kind
which
has
thus
enabled
the
psychical
power
to
express
itself
to
such
a
supreme
degree
in
the
realm
of
mind
and
matter
the
same
vitalistic
argument
is
applicable
to
the
lower
mental
processes
and
to
the
instinctual
powers
in
man
because
we
can
not
at
any
time
in
viewing
the
complete
evolution
of
man
as
a
twofold
being
composed
of
a
physical
and
a
psychical
part
force
aside
fechner
conviction
that
the
problem
is
a
one
a
study
of
sexual
instincts
in
children
seems
to
confirm
this
such
a
psychical
and
vitalistic
hypothesis
is
as
we
have
seen
strongly
supported
by
embryology
and
embryology
proves
conclusively
the
need
of
long
ages
of
physical
evolution
for
the
development
of
each
tissue
and
highly
specialized
organ
in
the
human
body
certain
french
and
german
and
other
scientists
of
the
vitalistic
school
have
demonstrated
physiologically
the
need
of
a
power
as
the
unifying
principle
which
attracts
and
compels
material
atoms
to
group
themselves
into
the
pattern
of
the
human
body
or
as
we
may
add
of
any
organic
body
psychical
researchers
at
the
outset
of
their
science
seem
apparently
to
have
demonstrated
psychologically
the
of
the
personal
and
it
is
very
likely
when
further
progress
has
been
made
in
psychics
that
there
will
arise
a
logical
need
to
postulate
in
addition
to
the
personal
a
hypothetical
as
the
unifying
principle
which
attracts
and
compels
psychical
atoms
of
experience
if
such
an
expression
may
be
used
to
group
themselves
into
the
personal
which
appears
to
survive
the
death
of
the
gross
physical
body
for
a
long
or
short
time
as
future
research
may
show
such
a
to
follow
the
view
held
by
celtic
mystics
led
by
acquired
instincts
which
were
transmitted
to
it
through
the
personality
held
by
the
celtic
esoteric
doctrine
to
be
a
temporary
combination
apparently
weaves
out
of
matter
the
adapted
to
its
further
evolution
in
a
way
analogous
to
that
in
which
a
silkworm
is
led
by
acquired
instincts
to
weave
a
cocoon
this
is
twofold
the
visible
body
derived
from
the
visible
elements
of
matter
and
the
invisible
or
derived
from
the
invisible
or
ethereal
elements
of
matter
strictly
speaking
for
the
celtic
mystic
this
is
something
upon
which
the
personal
consciousness
depends
for
its
psychical
unity
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
the
physical
body
depends
upon
the
personal
consciousness
for
its
physical
unity
the
celtic
mystic
holds
that
just
as
the
falls
back
again
into
its
primal
elements
of
matter
so
the
personal
apparently
able
to
survive
in
the
for
a
long
period
after
its
separation
from
the
grosser
physical
envelope
or
human
body
also
in
due
time
is
discarded
by
the
or
individuality
and
then
falls
back
into
its
primal
psychical
constituents
in
other
words
the
celtic
esoteric
doctrine
of
correctly
interpreted
does
not
conceive
personal
immortality
but
it
conceives
a
greater
kind
of
immortality
the
immortality
of
the
unknown
principle
which
gives
unity
to
each
temporary
personality
it
makes
use
of
and
which
we
prefer
to
designate
as
the
individuality
the
impersonator
and
this
individuality
is
the
bearer
of
all
evolutionary
gains
made
in
each
temporary
personality
through
which
it
reflects
itself
it
is
the
permanent
evolving
principle
perhaps
an
analogy
drawn
from
nature
will
make
the
celtic
position
clearer
we
may
say
that
the
personality
occupies
a
position
between
the
human
body
and
the
just
as
the
moon
occupies
a
position
between
the
earth
and
the
sun
personal
consciousness
is
to
the
human
body
what
the
moonlight
is
to
the
earth
merely
a
pale
reflection
from
a
third
thing
the
or
individuality
which
is
the
ultimate
source
of
both
sets
of
unities
the
material
or
in
its
twofold
aspect
and
the
psychical
or
personal
each
personality
is
temporary
while
the
individuality
like
the
sun
in
relation
to
the
earth
and
moon
is
capable
of
at
least
a
relative
immortality
the
sun
light
as
science
holds
existed
before
there
was
any
moon
to
reflect
it
on
to
the
earth
and
may
continue
to
exist
when
both
the
moon
and
earth
are
disintegrated
the
essential
nature
of
the
sun
energy
or
life
remains
unknown
to
science
so
does
the
essential
nature
of
the
energy
or
life
manifesting
itself
as
the
individuality
though
all
such
analogies
are
more
or
less
weak
this
one
adequately
fits
in
with
the
theories
concerning
the
celtic
esoteric
doctrine
of
which
the
most
learned
of
contemporary
celts
chiefly
mystics
have
favoured
us
with
and
it
is
our
rare
privilege
to
put
these
theories
on
record
for
whatever
they
may
be
worth
the
best
hypothesis
is
always
the
one
which
best
explains
all
available
data
and
to
our
mind
when
very
minutely
examined
in
a
way
which
chiefly
for
reasons
of
space
can
not
be
attempted
here
this
celtic
hypothesis
concerning
the
nature
and
destiny
of
man
is
the
best
hitherto
adduced
objectors
to
the
doctrine
as
held
by
the
celts
and
other
peoples
anciently
and
now
naturally
ask
why
if
we
have
lived
before
here
on
earth
in
physical
bodies
we
do
not
remember
it
but
the
shallowness
and
unscientific
nature
of
this
question
is
at
once
apparent
to
psychologists
who
know
that
there
exists
in
man
a
subconscious
mind
which
in
the
great
mass
of
people
is
almost
totally
dormant
subconscious
self
wrote
william
james
nowadays
a
psychological
entity
apart
from
all
religious
considerations
there
is
actually
and
literally
more
life
in
our
total
soul
than
we
are
at
any
time
aware
of
and
he
added
thus
is
scientific
to
interpret
all
otherwise
unaccountable
invasive
alternations
of
consciousness
as
results
of
the
tension
of
subliminal
memories
reaching
a
bursting
point
intuition
which
all
men
have
experienced
would
seem
to
be
the
result
of
a
momentary
contact
by
the
physical
brain
with
its
psychical
counterpart
the
subconscious
self
the
individuality
as
distinguished
from
the
personality
certain
observed
psychological
processes
in
ordinary
men
and
women
who
never
really
know
that
they
have
a
subconsciousness
or
transcendental
self
prove
that
it
exists
even
for
them
and
any
part
of
man
which
exists
and
functions
of
itself
can
be
developed
so
as
to
be
consciously
perceived
this
is
incontestable
let
us
point
out
a
few
of
these
observed
and
recorded
psychological
processes
there
may
be
an
unsolved
problem
in
the
mind
or
inability
to
recall
a
certain
name
or
fact
and
then
a
sudden
unexpected
intuitional
solving
of
the
problem
and
an
instantaneous
recollecting
of
the
desired
facts
at
a
time
when
the
ordinary
mind
may
be
entirely
absorbed
in
altogether
foreign
thoughts
again
many
persons
through
accident
or
disease
have
lost
their
memory
to
such
an
extent
as
to
require
complete
and
then
in
time
gradually
or
instantaneously
as
the
case
may
be
have
completely
recovered
it
and
we
noticed
in
our
study
of
supernatural
lapse
of
time
that
at
the
moment
of
accidental
loss
of
consciousness
as
in
drowning
for
example
all
forgotten
details
of
life
are
instantaneously
reproduced
in
a
complete
panorama
these
psychological
processes
support
what
we
have
said
above
with
respect
to
a
psychical
organ
being
behind
the
and
seem
thus
to
prove
that
the
subconscious
mind
is
the
place
for
recording
permanently
all
experiences
under
hypnosis
a
subject
may
be
requested
to
perform
a
certain
act
let
us
say
minutes
after
the
moment
of
making
the
request
when
the
hypnotic
condition
is
removed
the
subject
has
no
personal
consciousness
of
the
suggestion
but
as
different
experiments
have
proved
conclusively
he
invariably
performs
the
act
exactly
at
the
expiration
of
the
minutes
without
knowing
why
he
does
so
this
proves
that
there
is
a
subconsciousness
in
man
which
can
take
full
cognizance
of
such
a
suggestion
which
can
keep
count
of
the
passing
of
time
and
then
cause
the
unconscious
personality
to
act
in
response
to
its
will
again
in
extreme
old
age
people
who
have
come
to
have
an
imperfect
memory
or
none
at
all
in
their
normal
consciousness
under
abnormal
conditions
which
seemingly
are
due
to
a
temporary
influx
of
a
latent
psychical
power
into
the
physical
body
and
brain
or
else
to
an
awakening
of
a
dormant
force
within
the
physical
body
and
brain
themselves
often
regain
for
a
time
complete
and
clear
memory
of
their
childhood
this
proves
that
the
memory
is
somewhere
still
perfect
and
that
it
does
not
reside
in
the
consciousness
of
the
physical
brain
and
memory
albert
moll
in
his
treatise
on
hypnotism
says
that
events
in
the
normal
life
which
have
dropped
out
of
memory
can
be
remembered
in
hypnosis
english
officer
in
africa
was
hypnotized
by
hansen
and
suddenly
began
to
speak
a
strange
language
this
turned
out
to
be
welsh
which
he
had
learnt
as
a
child
but
had
forgotten
and
even
memory
of
acts
done
in
hypnotic
somnambulism
can
be
awakened
in
the
normal
state
furthermore
through
as
professor
freud
has
shown
forgotten
dreams
and
dreams
which
were
never
complete
in
the
ordinary
consciousness
can
be
recovered
in
their
entirety
out
of
the
subconsciousness
how
many
of
us
can
recall
without
some
mental
stimulus
certain
acts
performed
ten
years
ago
a
good
deal
of
our
present
life
is
no
longer
vivid
much
of
it
is
forgotten
and
in
old
age
many
of
the
memories
of
youth
and
of
mature
life
will
be
subconscious
if
this
brain
whose
total
existence
is
comprised
between
birth
and
death
can
not
remember
in
a
normal
way
all
its
own
experiences
how
could
it
be
expected
to
know
anything
at
all
of
hypothetical
past
lives
where
there
were
various
physical
brains
long
ago
disintegrated
unless
the
hypothetically
transcendental
individuality
whose
consciousness
is
the
subconsciousness
be
made
by
some
unusual
psychical
stimuli
to
transmit
its
memory
of
the
past
lives
to
each
new
brain
it
creates
in
other
words
to
have
memory
of
conditions
there
must
be
continuity
of
association
with
present
conditions
if
such
continuity
exists
it
exists
in
the
subconsciousness
and
if
it
exists
therein
then
in
order
to
recall
in
the
present
personal
or
ordinary
consciousness
which
began
at
birth
memory
of
an
anterior
state
of
consciousness
it
would
be
necessary
to
hold
impressed
upon
the
present
physical
brain
and
body
a
clear
and
unremittent
consciousness
of
the
subconsciousness
in
relation
to
our
personal
consciousness
apparently
our
greatest
powers
lie
in
the
subconsciousness
which
is
sleeping
and
in
embryo
awaiting
to
be
born
into
the
consciousness
of
this
world
through
the
slow
process
of
evolutionary
gestation
in
the
case
of
a
buddha
who
on
good
historical
authority
is
said
to
have
been
able
to
recall
all
past
existences
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
this
evolutionary
process
seems
to
have
reached
completion
under
ordinary
conditions
individuals
have
been
known
to
see
a
place
which
they
have
never
seen
before
or
to
do
a
thing
which
they
have
never
done
before
in
this
life
nor
in
any
conscious
and
yet
feel
that
they
have
seen
the
place
before
and
done
the
thing
before
th
ribot
in
his
of
chapter
iv
has
brought
together
many
cases
of
this
kind
some
are
undoubtedly
explicable
as
forgotten
experiences
of
the
present
life
others
to
our
mind
strongly
support
the
theory
of
experiences
preserved
in
memory
in
the
subconsciousness
under
chloroform
or
other
anaesthetics
patients
often
recover
for
the
time
being
forgotten
facts
of
experience
and
sometimes
appear
to
make
momentary
contact
with
their
subconsciousness
and
to
exhibit
therein
another
personality
in
certain
types
of
double
personality
which
are
not
the
kind
due
to
nor
to
as
in
there
are
two
memories
complete
and
absolutely
independent
of
the
other
and
in
similar
cases
where
the
subject
exhibits
alternately
numerous
personalities
we
see
the
individuality
that
is
to
say
the
subconscious
man
exhibiting
as
a
dramatist
might
various
characters
or
personalities
of
probable
past
existences
according
as
each
is
most
active
at
the
moment
similarly
sometimes
seems
not
only
to
revive
lost
memories
of
this
life
but
also
to
call
up
subconscious
memories
of
some
unknown
state
of
consciousness
which
may
be
from
a
previous
life
ribot
has
made
it
clear
from
his
careful
study
of
numerous
cases
of
amnesia
loss
of
memory
that
return
in
an
inverse
order
to
that
in
which
they
disappear
for
example
a
celebrated
russian
astronomer
lost
all
memory
save
that
of
his
childhood
and
in
recovering
it
there
appeared
first
the
recollections
of
youth
then
those
of
middle
age
then
the
experiences
of
later
years
and
finally
the
most
recent
events
many
even
more
marked
examples
of
the
law
of
regression
in
amnesia
are
given
by
ribot
we
conclude
from
them
that
all
strange
and
apparently
facts
of
experience
arising
in
consciousness
out
of
the
subconsciousness
as
in
the
different
cases
which
have
been
cited
above
would
necessarily
be
those
which
have
been
the
longest
lost
to
memory
and
hence
if
they
can
not
be
attached
to
this
present
life
then
they
can
only
be
derived
from
a
former
life
because
every
primary
detail
of
memory
must
always
originate
from
an
experience
at
some
past
period
of
time
ribot
himself
in
his
conclusion
to
diseases
of
makes
this
significant
observation
with
respect
to
the
law
of
regression
in
amnesia
law
of
regression
provides
us
with
an
explanation
for
extraordinary
revivification
of
certain
recollections
when
the
mind
turns
backward
to
conditions
of
existence
that
had
apparently
disappeared
for
ever
in
dreams
there
is
a
great
wealth
of
latent
memory
sometimes
memory
of
the
present
waking
life
but
often
not
capable
apparently
of
being
attached
to
it
nor
explicable
as
due
to
the
soul
wandering
from
the
body
during
sleep
the
hypothesis
of
seems
to
be
the
only
adequate
one
here
certain
dreams
suggest
that
man
possesses
innate
memories
extending
backwards
to
prehistoric
times
cf
above
this
fits
in
with
professor
freud
theory
in
his
that
dream
is
nothing
else
than
the
concealed
fulfilment
of
a
repressed
wish
some
dreams
are
the
form
of
frightful
cruel
horrible
scenes
which
seem
frightful
to
us
but
in
a
certain
depth
of
the
unconscious
satisfy
wishes
which
in
the
prehistoric
ages
of
our
own
mental
development
were
actually
recognized
as
desires
this
also
supports
our
vitalistic
view
of
the
evolution
of
human
instincts
again
in
somnambulism
there
is
a
much
more
exalted
memory
and
clear
cases
are
on
record
of
facts
being
then
consciously
present
which
can
not
be
accounted
for
save
through
the
same
hypothesis
if
we
keep
in
mind
the
psychology
of
the
dream
state
we
shall
probably
get
the
clearest
intellectual
theory
as
to
why
if
be
true
we
do
not
remember
various
previous
states
of
existence
in
our
present
state
of
consciousness
we
may
enter
a
dream
state
in
that
dream
state
by
dreaming
we
enter
a
second
dream
state
and
theoretically
though
not
by
common
experience
there
may
be
no
limit
to
superimposed
dream
states
each
one
in
itself
a
state
of
consciousness
distinct
from
the
waking
consciousness
accordingly
if
as
wordsworth
put
it
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
forgetting
of
another
state
of
consciousness
and
death
the
abrupt
ending
of
that
sleep
of
dreams
and
a
waking
up
or
if
the
direct
opposite
be
true
and
death
is
the
entrance
to
a
sleep
and
dream
state
of
consciousness
it
becomes
very
clear
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
us
here
now
either
to
recall
what
we
may
have
dreamt
or
have
actually
done
in
another
state
of
conscious
existence
corresponding
to
our
present
one
the
subtle
thinkers
of
modern
india
who
completely
accept
the
doctrine
of
as
a
universal
law
have
summed
up
this
abstruse
aspect
of
the
dream
psychology
as
follows
first
or
spiritual
state
was
ecstasy
from
ecstasy
it
the
ego
forgot
itself
into
deep
sleep
from
deep
sleep
it
awoke
out
of
unconsciousness
but
still
within
itself
into
the
internal
world
of
dreams
from
dreaming
it
passed
finally
into
the
thoroughly
waking
state
and
the
outer
world
of
sense
but
our
own
psychologists
are
not
yet
far
enough
advanced
to
accept
this
much
more
work
in
psychical
research
must
first
be
done
before
it
will
be
possible
for
them
to
announce
to
the
west
that
is
a
necessary
condition
for
which
they
now
hypothetically
accept
if
for
the
present
our
standpoint
be
that
of
our
own
psychologists
we
may
then
think
of
the
human
consciousness
as
a
spectrum
whose
central
parts
alone
are
visible
to
us
beyond
at
either
end
lies
an
unseen
and
to
us
unknown
region
awaiting
its
explorer
from
the
west
one
of
us
is
in
reality
an
abiding
psychical
entity
far
more
extensive
than
he
knows
an
individuality
which
can
never
express
itself
completely
through
any
corporeal
manifestation
the
self
manifests
through
the
organism
but
there
is
always
some
part
of
the
self
unmanifested
and
always
as
it
seems
some
power
of
organic
expression
in
abeyance
or
reserve
william
james
stated
the
position
thus
region
another
name
for
the
region
of
subconsciousness
is
obviously
the
larger
part
of
each
of
us
for
it
is
the
abode
of
everything
that
is
latent
and
the
reservoir
of
everything
that
passes
unrecorded
and
unobserved
men
of
science
see
no
way
of
accepting
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
physical
body
as
at
present
interpreted
by
christian
theology
but
the
late
professor
th
henri
martin
dean
of
the
faculty
of
letters
of
the
university
of
rennes
has
suggested
in
his
vie
that
the
doctrine
may
be
the
exoteric
interpretation
of
a
esoteric
truth
namely
that
the
soul
may
be
resurrected
in
a
new
physical
body
and
this
is
scientifically
possible
the
ancient
scientists
called
life
a
circle
in
the
upper
half
of
this
circle
or
here
on
the
visible
plane
we
know
that
in
the
physiological
history
of
man
and
of
all
living
things
there
is
first
the
embryonic
or
prenatal
state
then
birth
and
as
life
like
a
sun
rises
in
its
power
toward
the
zenith
there
is
childhood
youth
and
maturity
and
then
as
it
passes
the
zenith
on
its
way
to
the
horizon
there
is
decline
old
age
and
finally
death
and
as
a
scientific
possibility
we
have
in
the
lower
half
of
the
circle
in
hades
or
the
otherworld
of
the
celts
and
of
all
peoples
corresponding
processes
between
death
and
a
hypothetical
but
logically
necessary
the
logical
corollary
to
the
doctrine
and
an
integral
part
of
the
celtic
esoteric
theory
of
evolution
is
that
there
have
been
human
races
like
the
present
human
race
who
in
past
aeons
of
time
have
evolved
completely
out
of
the
human
plane
of
conscious
existence
into
the
divine
plane
of
conscious
existence
hence
the
gods
are
beings
which
once
were
men
and
the
actual
race
of
men
will
in
time
become
gods
man
now
stands
related
to
the
divine
and
invisible
world
in
precisely
the
same
manner
that
the
brute
stands
related
to
the
human
race
to
the
gods
man
is
a
being
in
a
lower
kingdom
of
evolution
according
to
the
complete
celtic
belief
the
gods
can
and
do
enter
the
human
world
for
the
specific
purposes
of
teaching
men
how
to
advance
most
rapidly
toward
the
higher
kingdom
in
other
words
all
the
great
teachers
jesus
buddha
zoroaster
and
many
others
in
different
ages
and
among
various
races
whose
teachings
are
extant
are
according
to
a
belief
yet
held
by
educated
and
mystical
celts
divine
beings
who
in
inconceivably
past
ages
were
men
but
who
are
now
gods
able
at
will
to
incarnate
into
our
world
in
order
to
emphasize
the
need
which
exists
in
nature
by
virtue
of
the
working
of
evolutionary
laws
to
which
they
themselves
are
still
subject
for
man
to
look
forward
and
so
strive
to
reach
divinity
rather
than
to
look
backward
in
evolution
and
thereby
fall
into
mere
animalism
the
stating
of
this
mystical
corollary
makes
the
exposition
of
the
complete
at
least
in
outline
as
shown
by
the
barddas
mss
in
our
chapter
vii
the
celtic
doctrine
of
is
the
scientific
extension
of
darwin
law
as
corrected
that
alone
through
traversing
the
circle
of
life
man
reaches
that
destined
perfection
which
natural
analogies
life
processes
as
exhibited
by
living
things
and
evolution
suggest
and
from
which
at
present
man
is
so
far
removed
there
seems
to
emerge
this
postulate
the
world
is
the
object
of
normal
consciousness
the
ego
or
the
object
of
subconsciousness
and
the
subconsciousness
can
not
be
realized
in
the
world
until
through
the
normal
consciousness
of
man
the
ego
is
able
to
function
completely
and
so
endow
man
with
full
in
matter
which
endowment
seems
to
be
the
goal
of
all
planetary
evolution
we
conclude
that
the
otherworld
of
the
celts
and
their
doctrine
of
accord
thoroughly
in
their
essentials
with
modern
science
and
accordingly
with
other
essential
elements
in
the
complete
celtic
which
we
have
in
the
preceding
chapter
found
to
be
equally
scientific
establish
our
psychological
theory
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
that
upon
a
logical
and
solid
foundation
and
we
now
submit
this
study
to
the
judgement
of
our
readers
with
more
complete
evidence
in
the
future
both
from
and
from
science
there
will
be
we
trust
a
better
vindication
of
the
theory
and
perhaps
finally
there
will
come
about
its
transformation
into
what
it
but
seems
to
us
to
be
now
a
fact
some
beliefs
which
a
century
ago
were
regarded
as
absurdities
are
now
regarded
as
fundamentally
scientific
in
the
same
way
what
in
this
generation
is
heretical
alike
to
the
christian
theologian
and
to
the
man

held

among

in
this
connexion
we
may
think
of
the
north
and
south
magnetic
poles
of
the
earth
as
centres
of
definite
yet
invisible
forces
which
can
be
detected
and
to
some
extent
measured
scientifically
for
a
circular
earthen
fort
throughout
ireland
there
are
many
ancient
often
prehistoric
earthworks
or
tumuli
which
are
popularly
called
or
and
in
these
are
considered
fairy
hills
or
the
abodes
of
various
orders
of
fairies
in
this
belief
we
see
at
work
a
definite
anthropomorphism
which
attributes
dwellings
here
on
earth
to
an
invisible
as
though
this
race
were
actually
the
spirits
of
the
ancient
irish
who
built
the
as
we
proceed
we
shall
see
how
important
and
varied
a
part
these
earthworks
play
in
the
irish
cf
chapter
viii
on
archaeology
an
irish
mystic
and
seer
of
great
power
with
whom
i
have
often
discussed
the
in
its
details
regards
paths
or
passes
as
actual
magnetic
arteries
so
to
speak
through
which
circulates
the
earth
magnetism
scholars
differ
as
to
the
signification
of
some
say
that
it
is
the
genitive
case
of
the
name
of
some
ancient
chieftain
who
was
buried
in
the

the
spelling
often
used
by
writers

hold
that
the
name
means

john
glynn
on
september
about
a
year
after
this
testimony
was
given
our
at
his
own
home
near
grange
told
to
me
again
the
same
essential
facts
concerning
his
psychical
experiences
as
during
my
first
interview
with
him
and
even
repeated
word
for
word
the
expressions
the
used
in
communicating
with
him
therefore
i
feel
that
he
is
thoroughly
sincere
in
his
beliefs
and
descriptions
whatever
various
readers
may
think
of
them
as
his
neighbours
said
to
me
about
him
and
i
interviewed
a
good
many
of
them
give
in
to
him
and
some
do
not
but
they
always
spoke
of
him
with
respect
though
a
few
naturally
consider
him
eccentric
at
the
time
of
our
second
meeting
which
gave
me
a
chance
to
revise
the
evidence
as
first
taken
down
made
this
additional
statement
do
not
tell
all
their
secrets
and
i
do
not
understand
many
things
about
them
nor
can
i
be
sure
that
everything
i
tell
concerning
them
is
exact
a
learned
and
more
careful
irish
seer
thinks
this
should
really
be
described
as
an
aura
i
have
been
told
by
a
friend
in
california
who
is
a
student
of
psychical
sciences
that
there
exist
in
certain
parts
of
that
state
notably
in
the
yosemite
valley
as
the
red
men
seem
to
have
known
according
to
their
traditions
invisible
races
exactly
comparable
to
the
of
this
ben
bulbin
country
such
as
our
describes
them
and
as
other
seers
in
ireland
have
described
them
and
quite
like
the
of
peace
as
described
by
kirk
the
seventh
son
in
his
see
this
study
these
california
races
are
said
to
exist
now
as
the
irish
and
scotch
invisible
races
are
said
to
exist
now
by
seers
who
can
behold
them
and
like
the
latter
races
are
described
as
a
distinct
order
of
beings
who
have
never
been
in
physical
embodiments
if
we
follow
the
traditions
of
the
red
men
the
yosemite
invisible
tribes
are
probably
but
a
few
of
many
such
tribes
scattered
throughout
the
north
american
continent
and
equally
with
their
celtic
relatives
they
are
described
as
a
warlike
race
with
more
than
human
powers
over
physical
nature
and
as
able
to
subject
or
destroy
men
this
refers
to
a
tale
told
by
hugh
currid
in
august
about
father
patrick
and
father
dominick
which
is
here
omitted
because
during
my
second
visit
to
grange
in
september
showed
the
tale
to
have
been
incorrectly
reported
the
same
story
however
based
upon
facts
according
to
several
reliable
witnesses
was
more
accurately
told
by
patrick
waters
at
the
time
of
my
and
appears
on
page
it
happened
that
i
had
in
my
pocket
a
fossil
picked
out
of
the
neighbouring
rocks
which
are
very
rich
in
fossils
i
showed
this
to
pat
to
ascertain
if
what
he
had
had
in
his
hand
looked
anything
like
it
and
he
at
once
said
after
this
ossianic
fragment
which
has
been
handed
down
orally
i
asked
pat
if
he
had
ever
heard
the
old
people
talk
about
dermot
and
grania
and
he
replied
be
sure
i
have
dermot
and
grania
used
to
live
in
these
parts
dermot
stole
finn
maccoul
sister
and
had
to
flee
away
he
took
with
him
a
bag
of
sand
and
a
bunch
of
heather
and
when
he
was
in
the
mountains
he
would
put
the
bag
of
sand
under
his
head
at
night
and
then
tell
everybody
he
met
that
he
had
slept
on
the
sand
the
and
when
on
the
sand
he
would
use
the
bunch
of
heather
for
a
pillow
and
say
he
had
slept
on
the
heather
the
mountains
and
so
nobody
ever
caught
him
at
all
as
to
probable
proof
that
there
was
an
atlantis
see
this
refers
to
robert
kirk
minister
of
aberfoyle
who
wrote
secret
see
this
study
in
going
from
east
ireland
to
galway
during
the
summer
of
i
passed
through
the
country
near
mullingar
where
there
was
then
great
excitement
over
a
leprechaun
which
had
been
appearing
to
and
to
many
of
the
i
talked
with
some
of
the
people
as
i
walked
through
part
of
county
meath
about
this
leprechaun
and
most
of
them
were
certain
that
there
could
be
such
a
creature
showing
itself
and
i
noticed
too
that
they
were
all
quite
anxious
to
have
a
chance
at
the
if
they
could
only
see
the
little
fellow
with
it
i
told
one
old
irishman
at
ballywillan
where
i
stopped
over
night
as
we
sat
round
his
peat
fire
and
pot
of
boiling
potatoes
that
the
leprechaun
was
reported
as
captured
by
the
police
in
mullingar
that
could
be
at
all
he
said
instantly
everybody
knows
the
leprechaun
is
a
spirit
and
ca
be
caught
by
any
blessed
policeman
though
it
is
likely
one
might
get
his
gold
if
they
got
him
cornered
so
he
had
no
chance
to
run
away
but
the
minute
you
wink
or
take
your
eyes
off
the
little
devil
sure
enough
he
is
gone

woman
guardian
of

is
called
toice
bhrean
untidy
or
lazy
wench
according
to
a
local
legend
she
is
said
to
have
been
originally
the
guardian
of
the
sacred
well
from
which
owing
to
her
neglect
lough

issued
and
in

of

sacred
well
from

according
to

and

tale
of
eochaidh
j
lynch
it
was
on
the
bank
of
the
little
river
camóg
which
flows
near
lough
gur
that
the
earl
of
desmond
one
day
saw
aine
as
she
sat
there
combing
her
hair
overcome
with
love
for
the
he
gained
control
over
her
through
seizing
her
cloak
and
made
her
his
wife
from
this
union
was
born
the
enchanted
son
geróid
iarla
even
as
galahad
was
born
to
lancelot
by
the
lady
of
the
lake
when
geróid
had
grown
into
young
manhood
in
order
to
surpass
a
woman
he
leaped
right
into
a
bottle
and
right
out
again
and
this
happened
in
the
midst
of
a
banquet
in
his
father
castle
his
father
the
earl
had
been
put
under
taboo
by
aine
never
to
show
surprise
at
anything
her
magician
son
might
do
but
now
the
taboo
was
forgotten
and
hence
broken
amid
so
unusual
a
performance
and
immediately
geróid
left
the
feasting
and
went
to
the
lake
as
soon
as
its
water
touched
him
he
assumed
the
form
of
a
goose
and
he
went

cavalcade
across

a
case
of
such
an
apparitional
appearance
of

been
recorded
by

a
young
woman
also
known
to
miss

saw
the
phantom
earl
by
himself
under
very
weird
circumstances
by
day
as
she
stood
at
the
margin
of
the
lake
washing
clothes
some
say
that
aine
true
is
in
her
hill
upon
which
on
every
john
night
the
peasantry
used
to
gather
from
all
the
immediate
neighbourhood
to
view
the
moon
for
aine
seems
to
have
been
a
moon
goddess
like
diana
and
then
with
torches
made
of
bunches
of
straw
and
hay
tied
on
poles
used
to
march
in
procession
from
the
hill
and
afterwards
run
through
cultivated
fields
and
amongst
the
cattle
the
underlying
purpose
of
this
latter
ceremony
probably
was
as
is
the
case
in
the
isle
of
man
and
in
brittany
see
pp
where
corresponding
surviving
from
an
ancient
agricultural
cult
are
still
celebrated
to
exorcise
the
land
from
all
evil
spirits
and
witches
in
order
that
there
may
be
good
harvests
and
rich
increase
of
flocks
sometimes
on
such
occasions
the
goddess
herself
has
been
seen
leading
the
sacred
procession
cf
the
bacchus
cult
among
the
ancient
greeks
who
believed
that
the
god
himself
led
his
worshippers
in
their
sacred
procession
at
night

being
like

this
respect
more

the
hill
was
crowded
with

there

on

brittany
on
all

night
libations

this
is
proof
that
the
nature
of
fairies
in
scotland
and
of
the
dead
in
brittany
is
thought
to
be
the
same

parts

known

in

to
him
at

coming

at
night
a

was
sent

shony
i
give
you

you
will
be
so
kind

to
give
us
plenty
of
for

from

would
become

becomes
one
thinks
of
one
of
the
goddesses
in
the
edda
in
any
case
the
word
is
norse
it
seems
therefore
that
the
celtic
stock
in
lewis
have
adopted
the
name
or
and
possibly
also
the
god
it
designates
through
contact
with
norsemen
but
at
all
events
they
have
assimilated
him
to
their
own
fairy
pantheon
as
we
can
see
in
their
celebrating
special
libations
to
him
on
the
ancient
celtic
feast
of
the
dead

fairies
halloween
this
as

told
me
i
believe
very
justly
represents
the
present
state
of
in
many
parts
of

there
are
it
is
true
old
men
and
women
here
and
there
who
know
much
about
fairies
but
they
fearing
the
ridicule
of
a
younger
and
generation
are
generally
unwilling
to
admit
any
belief
in
fairies

it
is
probably
a

but
as

a

bower

we
recognize
the
fairy
woman
as
one
of
the
tuatha
de
fairies
one
of
the
women
of
the
as
irish
seers
call
them
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
present
inhabitants
of
barra
or
at
least
most
of
them
are
the
descendants
of
irish
colonists
who
belonged
to
the
clan
eoichidh
of
county
cork
and
who
emigrated
from
there
to
barra
in
they
brought
with
them
their
old
customs
and
beliefs
and
in
their
isolation
their
children
have
kept
these
things
alive
in
almost
their
primitive
celtic
purity
for
example
besides
their
belief
in
fairies
may
day
baaltine
and
november
eve
are
still
rigorously
observed
in
the
pagan
way
and
so
is
easter
for
it
too
before
being
claimed
by
christianity
was
a
sun
festival
and
how
beautiful
it
is
in
this
age
to
see
the
youths
and
maidens
and
some
of
the
elders
of
these
christian
climb
to
the
rocky
heights
of
their
little
on
easter
morn
to
salute
the
sun
as
it
rises
out
of
the
mountains
to
the
east
and
to
hear
them
say
that
the
sun
dances
with
joy
that
morning
because
the
christ
is
risen
in
a
similar
way
they
salute
the
new
moon
making
as
they
do
so
the
sign
of
the
cross
finn
barr
is
said
to
have
been
a
county
cork
man
of
great
sanctity
and
he
probably
came
to
barra
with
the
colony
for
he
is
the
patron
saint
of
the
island
and
hence
its
name
to
my
friend
michael
buchanan
of
barra
i
am
indebted
for
this
history
and
these
traditions
of
his
native
isle
hosts
the
the
hosts
are
the
spirits
of
mortals
who
have
died
according
to
one
informant
the
spirits
fly
about
in
great
clouds
up
and
down
the
face
of
the
world
like
the
starlings
and
come
back
to
the
scenes
of
their
earthly
transgressions
no
soul
of
them
is
without
the
clouds
of

dimming
the
brightness
of
the
works
of

nor
can
any

till

alexander
carmichael
ii
this
curious
tale
suggests
that
certain
of
the
fairy
women
who
entice
mortals
to
their
love
in
modern
times
are
much
the
same
if
not
the
same
as
the
of
mystics
but
it
is
not
intended
by
this
observation
to
confuse
the
higher
orders
of
the
and
all
the
fairy
folk
like
the
fays
who
come
from
avalon
with
though
and
fairy
women
in
general
were
often
confused
and
improperly
identified
the
one
with
the
other
it
need
not
be
urged
in
this
example
of
a
woman
that
we
have
to
do
not
with
a
being
of
flesh
and
blood
whatever
various
readers
may
think
of
her
otherwise
known
as
william
cain
is
the
musician
referred
to
by
the
late
john
nelson
the
statement
that
william
cain
played
one
of
these
fairy
tunes
at
one
of
our
manx
entertainments
in
peel
is
perfectly
correct
sophia
morrison
this
is
the
of
irish
seers
who
would
be
inclined
to
follow
the
manx
custom
and
call
the
fairies
people
of
the
middle
world
in
manx
eve
on
this
evening
the
fairies
were
supposed
to
be
peculiarly
active
to
propitiate
them
and
to
ward
off
the
influence
of
evil
spirits
and
witches
who
were
also
active
at
this
time
green
leaves
or
boughs
and
or
primrose
flowers
were
strewn
on
the
threshold
and
branches
of
the
or
mountain
ash
made
into
small
crosses
without
the
aid
of
a
knife
which
was
on
no
account
to
be
used
steel
or
iron
in
any
form
being
taboo
to
fairies
and
spirits
and
stuck
over
the
doors
of
the
and
cows
were
further
protected
from
the
same
influences
by
having
the
john
feast
wort
placed
in
their
stalls
this
was
also
one
of
the
occasions
on
which
no
one
would
give
fire
away
and
on
which
fires
were
and
are
still
lit
on
the
hills
to
drive
away
the
fairies
sophia
morrison
i
am
wholly
indebted
to
miss
morrison
for
these
manx
verses
and
their
translation
which
i
have
substituted
for
moore
english
rendering
miss
morrison
after
my
return
to
oxford
saw
moore
and
took
them
down
from
her
a
task
i
was
not
well
fitted
to
do
when
the
tale
was
told
it
has
been
suggested
and
no
doubt
correctly
that
these
murmuring
sounds
heard
on
dalby
mountain
are
due
to
the
action
of
close
at
hand
washing
over
shifting
masses
of
pebbles
on
the
shore
though
this
be
the
true
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
itself
it
only
proves
the
attribution
of
cause
to
be
wrong
and
not
the
underlying
animistic
conception
of
spiritual
beings
in
this
mythological
role
manannan
is
apparently
a
sun
god
or
else
the
sun
itself
and
the
manx
coat
of
arms
which
is
connected
with
him
being
a
sun
symbol
suggests
to
us
now
ages
long
prior
to
history
when
the
isle
of
man
was
a
sacred
isle
dedicated
to
the
cult
of
the
supreme
god
of
light
and
life
and
when
all
who
dwelt
thereon
were
regarded
as
the
children
of
the
sun
sir
john
rhŷs
tells
me
that
this
snowdon
was
contributed
by
the
late
lady
rhŷs
who
as
a
girl
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
snowdon
and
heard
very
much
from
the
old
people
there
most
of
whom
believed
in
the
fairies
and
she
herself
then
used
to
be
warned
in
the
manner
mentioned
against
being
carried
away
into
the
fairyland
cf
folklore
welsh
and
pp
where
sir
john
rhŷs
says
of
his
friend
professor
haddon
find
also
that
he
among
others
has
anticipated
me
in
my
theory
as
to
the
origins
of
the
fairies
witness
the
following
extract
from
the
syllabus
of
a
lecture

him
at

what
are
the
fairies
legendary
origin
of
the
fairies
it
is
evident
from
fairy
literature
that
there
is
a
mixture
of
the
possible
and
the
impossible
of
fact
and
fancy
part
of
fairydom
refers
to
spirits
that
never
were
embodied
other
fairies
are
spirits
of
environment
nature
or
local
spirits
and
household
or
domestic
spirits
spirits
of
the
organic
world
spirits
of
plants
and
spirits
of
animals
spirits
of
men
or
ghosts
and
witches
and
wizards
or
men
possessed
with
other
spirits
all
these
and
possibly
other
elements
enter
into
the
fanciful
aspects
of
fairyland
but
there
is
a
large
residuum
of
real
occurrences
these
point
to
a
clash
of
races
and
we
may
regard
many
of
these
fairy
sagas
as
stories
told
by
men
of
the
iron
age
of
events
which
happened
to
men
of
the
bronze
age
in
their
conflicts
with
men
of
the
neolithic
age
and
possibly
these
too
handed
on
traditions
of
the
paleolithic
age
this
is
the
one
tale
i
have
found
in
north
wales
about
a
midwife
and
fairies
a
type
of
tale
common
to
west
ireland
isle
of
man
cornwall
and
brittany
but
in
a
reverse
version
the
midwife
there
being
as
she
is
sometimes
in
welsh
versions
one
of
the
human
race
called
in
by
fairies
if
evidence
of
the
oneness
of
the
celtic
mind
were
needed
we
should
find
it
here
cf
pp
there
are
in
this
type
of
as
the
advocates
of
the
pygmy
theory
may
well
hold
certain
elements
most
likely
traceable
to
a
of
some
early
race
or
special
class
of
some
early
race
who
knew
the
secrets
of
midwifery
and
the
use
of
medicines
when
such
knowledge
was
considered
magical
but
in
each
example
of
this
midwife
story
there
is
the
germ
idea
no
matter
what
other
ideas
cluster
round
it
that
fairies
like
spirits
are
only
to
be
seen
by
an
vision
or
as
psychical
researchers
might
say
by
clairvoyance
after
this
remarkable
story
jones
told
me
about
another
very
rare
psychical
experience
of
her
own
which
is
here
recorded
because
it
illustrates
the
working
of
the
psychological
law
of
the
association
of
ideas
husband
price
jones
was
drowned
some
forty
years
ago
within
four
miles
of
arms
head
near
bangor
on
friday
at
midday
and
that
night
at
about
one
he
appeared
to
me
in
our
bedroom
and
laid
his
head
on
my
breast
i
tried
to
ask
him
where
he
came
from
but
before
i
could
get
my
breath
he
was
gone
i
believed
at
the
time
that
he
was
out
at
sea
perfectly
safe
and
well
but
next
day
saturday
at
about
noon
a
message
came
announcing
his
death
i
was
as
fully
awake
as
one
can
be
when
i
thus
saw
the
spirit
of
my
husband
he
returned
to
me
a
second
time
about
six
months
later
had
this
happened
in
west
ireland
it
is
almost
certain
that
public
opinion
would
have
declared
that
price
jones
had
been
by
the
or
people
here
we
find
the
showing
quite
the
same
characteristics
as
welsh
elves
in
general
as
cornish
pixies
and
as
breton
or
that
is
given
to
dancing
at
night
to
stealing
children
and
to
deceiving
travellers
this
partially
sustains
the
view
put
forth
in
our
chapter
on
environment
that
david
during
pagan
times
was
already
a
sacred
spot
and
perhaps
then
the
seat
of
a
druidic
oracle
here
we
have
an
example
of
the
being
identified
with
a
prehistoric
race
quite
in
accordance
with
the
argument
of
the
pygmy
theory
we
have
however
as
the
essential
idea
that
the
heard
singing
were
the
spirits
of
this
prehistoric
race
thus
our
contention
that
ancestral
spirits
play
a
leading
part
in
the
is
sustained
and
the
pygmy
theory
appears
quite
at
its
true
relative
value
as
able
to
explain
one
subordinate
ethnological
strand
in
the
complex
fabric
of
the
belief
this
story
is
much
like
the
one
recorded
by
giraldus
cambrensis
about
a
boy
going
to
fairyland
and
returning
to
his
mother
see
this
study
the
possibility
that
it
may
be
an
independent
version
of
the
told
to
cambrensis
which
has
continued
to
live
on
among
the
people
makes
it
highly
interesting
jones
gives
further
evidence
on
the
doctrine
in
wales
pp
and
concerning
merlin
and
sacrifice
to
appease
pp
as
a
result
of
his
researches
the
rev
morgan
has
just
published
a
new
work
entitled
history
and
antiquities
of
the
parish
of
carmarthen
in
these
last
two
anecdotes
as
in
modern
we
observe
a
popular
practice
of
necromancy
or
the
calling
up
of
spirits
of
spirits
and
spirit
communication
through
a
human
who
is
the
as
well
as
divination
the
revealing
of
things
hidden
and
the
foretelling
of
future
events
this
is
direct
evidence
that
welsh
fairies
or
the
were
formerly
the
same
to
welshmen
as
spirits
are
to
spiritualists
now
we
seem
therefore
to
have
proof
of
our
psychological
theory
see
chap
xi
here
we
have
a
combination
of
many
distinct
elements
and
influences
as
among
mortals
so
among
the
there
is
a
king
and
this
conception
may
have
arisen
directly
from
anthropomorphic
influences
on
the
ancient
brythonic
religion
or
it
may
have
come
directly
from
druidic
teachings
the
locating
of
ab
like
a
god
in
a
rather
than
like
his
counterpart
ab
in
a
is
probably
due
to
a
peculiar
admixture
of
druidism
and
christianity
at
first
both
gods
were
probably
druidic
or
pagan
and
the
same
but
ab
became
a
demon
or
evil
god
under
christian
influences
while
ab
seems
to
have
curiously
retained
his
original
good
reputation
in
spite
of
christianity
cf
the
name
reminds
us
at
once
of
arthur
queen
or
apparition
and
the
sheep
of
can
properly
be
explained
by
the
naturalistic
theory
it
seems
however
that
analogy
was
imaginatively
suggested
between
the
queen
as
resembling
the
welsh
white
lady
or
a
being
and
her
sheep
the
clouds
also
of
a
necessarily
character
all
this
is
an
admirable
illustration
of
the
great
complexity
of
the
the
parallel
between
this
welsh
method
of
conferring
vision
and
the
breton
method
is
very
striking
cf
this
is
the
substance
of
the
story
as
it
was
told
to
me
by
a
gentleman
who
lives
within
sight
of
the
farm
where
the
image
is
said
to
have
been
found
and
one
day
he
took
me
to
the
house
and
showed
me
the
room
and
the
place
in
the
wall
where
the
find
was
made
the
old
manor
is
one
of
the
solidest
and
most
picturesque
of
its
kind
in
wales
and
in
spite
of
its
extreme
age
well
preserved
he
being
as
a
native
welshman
of
the
locality
well
acquainted
with
its
archaeology
thinks
it
safe
to
place
an
age
of
six
to
eight
hundred
years
on
the
manor
what
is
interesting
about
this
matter
of
age
arises
from
the
query
was
the
image
one
of
the
virgin
or
of
some
christian
saint
or
was
it
a
druid
idol
both
opinions
are
current
in
the
neighbourhood
but
there
is
a
good
deal
in
favour
of
the
second
the
region
the
little
valley
on
whose
side
stands
the
pentre
evan
cromlech
the
finest
in
britain
is
believed
to
have
been
a
favourite
place
with
the
ancient
druids
and
in
the
oak
groves
which
still
exist
there
tradition
says
there
was
once
a
flourishing
pagan
school
for
neophytes
and
that
the
cromlech
instead
of
being
a
place
for
interments
or
for
sacrifices
was
in
those
days
completely
enclosed
forming
like
other
cromlechs
a
darkened
chamber
in
which
novices
when
initiated
were
placed
for
a
certain
number
of
days
the
interior
being
called
the
or
court
of
ceridwen
the
same
remedy
is
prescribed
in
brittany
when
mischievous
or
lead
a
traveller
astray
in
ireland
when
the
lead
a
traveller
astray
and
at
rollright
oxfordshire
england
an
old
woman
told
me
that
it
is
efficacious
against
being
led
astray
through
witchcraft
obviously
the
fairy
and
witch
spell
are
alike
the
same
sort
of
a
story
as
this
is
told
in
lower
brittany
where
the
or
slaughter
a
farmer
fat
cow
or
ox
and
invite
the
farmer
to
partake
of
the
feast
it
provides
if
he
does
so
with
good
grace
and
humour
he
finds
his
cow
or
ox
perfectly
whole
in
the
morning
but
if
he
refuses
to
join
the
feast
or
joins
it
unwillingly
in
the
morning
he
is
likely
to
find
his
cow
or
ox
actually
dead
and
eaten
see

john
rhŷs

vaguely

i
suspect
the

is
only
an
form
of

not

one
of
the
fate
of
margery

spirit

rivalry

fun
the
penzance
people
like
to
taunt
the
people
of

almost
a
suburb
of
penzance
by
calling
them
and
that
the
newlyn
townsmen
very
much
resent
being
so
designated
thus
what
no

was
originally
an
ancient
cult
to
some
local
called
has
survived
as
see

version
which
is
more
usual
is
that
the
pisky
anointed

so
rendered
itself

commanding

above

john
cornish
solicitor
of

me
that
when

suggested
to
an
old
miner
who
fully
believed
in

that
the
noises
they
were
supposed
to
make
were
due
to
material
causes
the
old

became
quite
annoyed
and
said
i
guess
i
have
ears
to
hear
for
the
cornish

in

time
cf
his

the
three
stones
were
not
as
now
in
a
direct
line
the
has
aroused
much
speculation
among
archaeologists
as
to
its
probable
use
or
meaning
no
doubt
it
was
astronomical
and
religious
in
its
significance
and
it
may
have
been
a
calendar
stone
with
which
ancient
priests
took
sun
observations
cf
sir
norman
lockyer
and
other
stone

it
may
have
been
otherwise
related
to
a
sun
cult

to
some
pagan
initiatory
rites

asked
what
a

is

explained
nath
is
a
bird
with

beak
like

of

parrot

with
black

grey
feathers
the
naths
live
on
in
holes
like
rabbits
and
before
they
start
to
fly
they
first
run
the
nath

henry

as

we

not
here
attempt

present
even
in
outline
all
the
complex
ethnological
arguments
for
and
against
the
existence
in
prehistoric
times
of
european
pygmy
races
attention
ought
however
to
be
called
to
the
remarkable
finds
recently
made
in
the
des
at
mentone
france
a
certain
number
of
skeletons
of
probably
the
earliest
men
who
dwelt
on
the
present
land
surface
of
europe
which
were
found
there
suggest
that
different
racial
stocks
possibly
in
succession
have
preceded
the
aryan
stock
the
first
race
as
indicated
by
two
small
skeletons
of
a
woman
mm
inches
and
of
a
boy
mm
inches
in
height
found
in
the
lowest
part
of
the
was
probably
ethiopian
the
succeeding
race
was
probably
mongolian
judging
from
other
remains
found
in
another
part
of
the
same
and
especially
from
the
chancelade
skeleton
with
its
distinctly
eskimo
appearance
only
mm
inches
high
discovered
near
perigneux
france
the
race
succeeding
this
one
was
possibly
the
one
out
of
which
our
own
aryan
race
evolved
in
relation
to
the
pygmy
theory
these
recent
finds
are
of
the
utmost
significance
they
confirm
windle
earlier
conclusion
that
contrary
to
the
argument
advanced
to
support
the
pygmy
theory
the
neolithic
races
of
central
europe
were
not
true
pygmies
a
people
whose
average
stature
does
not
exceed
four
feet
nine
inches
cf
windle
pygmies
of
the
london
introduction
and
furthermore
these
finds
show
as
far
as
any
available
ethnological
data
can
that
there
are
no
good
reasons
for
believing
that
european
and
therefore
celtic
lands
were
once
dominated
by
pygmies
even
in
epochs
so
remote
that
we
can
only
calculate
them
in
tens
of
thousands
of
years
nevertheless
it
is
very
highly
probable
that
a
of
lappish
pictish
or
other
small
but
not
true
pygmy
races
has
superficially
coloured
the
modern
fairy
traditions
of
northern
scotland
of
the
western
hebrides
where
what
may
prove
to
have
been
lapps
or
picts
houses
undoubtedly
remain
of
northern
ireland
of
the
isle
of
man
and
slightly
if
indeed
at
all
the
fairy
traditions
of
other
parts
of
the
celtic
world
cf
david
macritchie
testimony
of
london
and
his
criticism
of
our
own
psychological
theory
in
the
october
and
january
entitled
respectively
new
solution
of
the
fairy
and
and
again
the
very
small
flint
implements
frequently
found
in
celtic
lands
and
elsewhere
have
perhaps
very
reasonably
been
attributed
to
a
pygmy
race
though
we
must
bear
in
mind
in
this
connexion
that
it
would
be
very
unwise
to
conclude
definitely
that
no
race
save
a
race
could
have
made
and
used
such
implements
american
red
men
were
when
discovered
by
europeans
and
still
are
making
and
using
the
tiniest
of
precisely
the
same
in
size
and
design
as
those
found
in
celtic
lands
and
attributed
to
pygmies
the
use
of
small
flint
implements
for
special
purposes
arrows
for
shooting
small
game
like
birds
for
spearing
fish
and
for
use
in
warfare
as
poisoned
arrows
seems
to
have
been
common
to
most
primitive
peoples
of
normal
stature
contemporary
pygmy
races
far
removed
from
celtic
lands
are
also
using
them
and
no
doubt
their
prehistoric
ancestors
used
them

else

no

the
most
curious

in

are
those
which
represent
the

and
his

companions
fresh
come
from

as
in

mysterious

so
changed
that
they
must
neither
dismount

thus
come

allow
any

to

seems
to
have
come
about
from
their
sojourn
among

who
are
eternally
young
and
unfading
a
transmutation
apparently
quite
the
same
as
that
which
the
are

to
bring
about
now
when
one
of

is
taken
to
live

and
in

no
mortal
ever
returns
from

a
day
older
than
on
entering
it
no
matter
how
many
years
may

the
idea
reminds
us
of
the
dreams
of

thought
there
exists

the
parallel
would
be
a
striking
and
exact
one
in
any
case
for
it
is
recorded
that
jesus
after
he
had
arisen
from
the
dead
had
come
out
of
hades
or
the
invisible
realm
of
subjectivity
which
too
is
fairyland
appeared
to
some
and
not
to
others
some
being
able
to
recognize
him
and
others
not
and
concerning
the
nature
of
jesus
body
at
the
ascension
not
all
theologians
are
agreed
some
believe
it
to
have
been
a
physical
body
so
purified
and
transmuted
as
to
be
like
or
the
same
as
a
spiritual
body
and
thus
capable
of
invisibility
and
of
entrance
into
the
realm
of
spirit
the
scotch
minister
and
seer
used
this
same
parallel
in
describing
the
nature
and
power
of
fairies
and
spirits
hence
it
would
seem
to
follow
if
we
admit
the
influence
in
the
irish
text
to
be
christian
that
early
like
modern
christians
have
in

described
the

is
so
described
that
we
recognize
in
its
symbolism
the
same
essential
significance
as
in
the
writings
of
both
pagan
and
christian
mystics
thus
is
what
the
green
denotes
when
he
the
priest
looks
at
it
that
his
heart
and
his
mind
be
filled
with
great
faintness

exceeding
sorrow
for

is

by
it
is
his
burial
at

of

for
green
is
the
original
colour
of
every
earth
and
therefore
the
colour
of
the
robe
of
offering
is
likened
unto
green
stokes
during
the
ceremonies
of
initiation
into
the
ancient
mysteries
it
is
supposed
that
the
neophyte
left
the
physical
body
in
a
trance
state
and
in
full
consciousness
which
he
retained
afterwards
entered
the
subjective
world
and
beheld
all
its
wonders
and
inhabitants
and
that
coming
out
of
that
world
he
was
clothed
in
a
robe
of
sacred
green
to
symbolize
his
own
spiritual
resurrection
and
into
real
life
for
he
had
penetrated
the
mystery
of
death
and
was
now
an
initiate
even
yet
there
seems
to
be
an
echo
of
the
ancient
egyptian
mysteries
in
the
festival
of
celebrated
in
the
middle
of
the
wheat
harvest
in
lower
egypt
is
a
holy
personage
who
according
to
the
belief
of
the
people
was
the
vizier
of
a
contemporary
of
abraham
and
who
never
having
died
is
still
living
and
will
continue
to
live
until
the
day
of
judgement
and
he
is
always
represented
in
green
garments
whence
probably
the
name
he
bears
green
is
thus
associated
with
a
hero
or
god
who
is
immortal

unchanging

the
remnant

ancient

preserved

the
oral
traditions
of
the
people
and
the
prevalence
of
such
bardic
traditions
in
a
part
of
wales
where
some
of

stories
either
took
shape

from
where
they
drew
material
would
make
it
probable

there
may
even
be
some
close
relationship

the
olwen
of

the
olwen
of

how
tertullian

the

it
is
the
corrupted
form

the
doctrine
viz
transmigration
of
human
souls

bodies

he
therein
as
well
as
in

and
elsewhere
chiefly
and
logically
combats

also
combated
it

first
shows
why
a
human
soul
must
return
into
a
human
body
in

with

analogy
every
creature
being
after
its

then
because
the
purpose
of
the
resurrection
is
the
judgement
that
the
soul
must
return
into
its
own
body
and
he
concludes
is
surely
more
worthy
of
belief
that
a
man
will
be
restored
from
a
man
any
given
person
from
any

person

still
a

of

concerning

and
find
that
irenaeus
the
last
refuge
of
christian
haeresiologists
has
so
condensed
and
paraphrased
his
sources
that
we
can
not
depend
upon
him
at
all
for
a
consistent
exposition
of
gnostic
doctrines
which
with
more
or
less
prejudice
he
is
trying
to
refute
it
is
true
that
the
age
of
these
manuscripts
has
not
been
satisfactorily
determined
in
fact
most
of
them
have
not
yet
been
carefully

very
probably
however
as
appears
to
be
the
case
with
the

have
been
copied
from
manuscripts
which
were
contemporary
with
or
earlier
than
the
time
of

many
unprejudiced
scholars
are

unwilling
to
admit
the

determined
what
was
orthodox
and
what
heretical
doctrines
among
the
because
many
of
their
dogmatic
decisions
were
based
upon
the
unscholarly
of

upon
other
equally
unreliable
evidence
the
data
which
have
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
scholars
about
early
christian
thought
and
gnosticism
are
now
much
more
complete
and
trustworthy
than
the
similar
data
were
upon
which
the
council
of
constantinople
in
based
its
decision
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
and
the
truth
coming
to
be
recognized
seems
to
be
that
the
gnostics
rather
than
the
church
fathers
who
adopted
from
them
what
doctrines
they
liked
condemning
those
they
did
not
like
should
henceforth
be
regarded
as
the
first
christian
theologians
and
mystics
if
this
view
of
the
very
difficult
and
complex
matter
be
accepted
then
modern
christianity
itself
ought
to
be
allowed
to
resume
what
thus
appears
to
have
been
its
original
position
so
long
obscured
by
the
but
nevertheless
ecclesiastical
councils
as
the
synthesizer
of

some
such
view
has
been
accepted
by
many
eminent
christian
theologians
since
origen
the
cambridge
platonist
henry
more
openly
advocated
the
doctrine
in
the
seventeenth
century

whom
i
met
in
the
morbihan
where
he
now

told
me
that
he
believes
thoroughly
in
the
doctrine
of
and
that
it
is
according
to
his
opinion
the
proper
and
logical
interpretation
of
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
and
he
added
that
there
are
priests
in
his
church
who
have
told
him
that
their
personal
interpretation
of
the
purgatorial
doctrine
is
the
same
thus
some
roman
catholics
do
not
deny
the
doctrine
and
such
conversations
as
this
with
catholic
celts
in
ireland
and
brittany
lead
me
to
believe
that
to
a
larger
extent
than
has
been
suspected
the
old
celtic
doctrine
of
may
have
been
one
of
the
chief
foundations
for
the
modern
roman
catholic
doctrine
of
purgatory
whose
origin
is
not
clearly
indicated
in
any
theological
works
for
us
this
probability
is
important
as
well
as
interesting
and
especially
so
when
we
remember
the
profound
influence
which
the
celtic
purgatory
certainly
exerted
on
the
church
during
the
middle
ages

doctrine
of

arose
from

in
this
particular
example
the
uninitiated
scribe
evidently
having
failed
to
grasp
an
important
aspect
of
the
doctrine
as
this
was
esoterically
explained
in
the
mysteries
namely
that
between
death

while
the
conscious
ego
is
resident
in
the
otherworld
the
physical
atoms
of
the
discarded
human
body
may
transmigrate
through
various
plant
and
animal
bodies
appears
to
set
forth
as
celtic
an
erroneous
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
the
conscious
ego
itself
see
in
other
texts
for
example
in
the
song
which
amairgen
considered
the
gaelic
equivalent
or
even
original
of
the
brythonic
taliessin
sang
as

with

see
the

but
these
transformations
seem
to
echo
poetically
and
often
rationally
a
very
mystical
celtic
pantheism
in

in

there
has

corrupt
form

the
doctrine

transmigration

douglas

has
sent
to
me
the
following
evidence
have
a
poem
consisting
of
nearly
one
hundred
stanzas
about
a
pig
who
ate
an
irish
manuscript
and
who
by
eating
it
recovered
human
speech
for
hours
and
gave
his
master
an
account
of
his
previous
embodiments
he
had
been
a
man
of
cromwell
a
weaver
in
france
a
subject
of
the
grand
signor
the
poem
might
be
about
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
it
is
probable
that
the
poet
who
composed
this
poem
intended
to
add
a
touch
of
modern
irish
humour
by
making
use
of
the
pig
we
should
nevertheless
bear
in
mind
that
the
pig
or
as
is
more
commonly
the
rule
the
wild
boar
holds
a
very
curious
and
prominent
position
in
the
ancient
mythology
of
ireland
and
of
wales
as
well
it
was
regarded
as
a
magical
animal
cf
and
apparently
was
also
a
druid
symbol
whose
meaning
we
have
lost
possibly
the
poet
may
have
been
aware
of
this
if
so
he
does
not
necessarily
imply
transmigration
of
the
human
soul
into
animal
bodies
but
is
merely
employing
symbolism

the
doctrine
of
kingly
rule
by
divine
right
was
substituted
after
the
conversion
of
the
roman
empire
for
the
very
ancient
belief
that
the
emperor
was
a
god
incarnate
not
necessarily
reincarnate
and
the
same
christianized
aspect
of
a
doctrine
stands
behind
the
english
kingship
at
the
present
day
a
curious
parallel
to
this
irish
doctrine
that
through
one
suffers
for
the
sins
committed
in
a
previous
is
found
in
the
christian
scriptures
where
in
asking
jesus
about
a
man
born
blind
who
did
sin
this
man
or
his
parents
that
he
should
be
born
blind
the
disciple
exhibits
what
must
have
been
a
popular
jewish
belief
in
quite
like
the
celtic
one
see
john
ix
though
the
rabbis
admitted
the
possibility
of
sin
in
thought
this
passage
seems
to
point
unmistakably
to
a
jewish
doctrine
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
connexion
with
these
two
complementary
ideas
what
has
been
written
by
standish
concerning
strange
phenomena
witnessed
at
the
time
of
charles
funeral
his
followers
were
committing
charles
parnell
remains
to
the
earth
the
sky
was
bright
with
strange
lights
and
flames
only
a
coincidence
possibly
and
yet
persons
not
superstitious
have
maintained
that
there
is
some
mysterious
sympathy
between
the
human
soul
and
the
elements
those
strange
flames
recalled
to
my
memory
what
is
told
of
similar
phenomena
said
to
have
been
witnessed
when
tidings
of
the
death
of
the
great
christian
saint
columba
overran
the
of
europe
as
perhaps
truer
than
i
had
imagined
her
pp
cf
lenihan
its
history
and
dublin
i
take
this
to
mean
somewhat
as
in
the
similar
case
of
dechtire
the
mother
of
cuchulainn
see
above
that
the
kind
of
soul
or
character
which
will
be
reincarnated
in
the
child
is
determined
by
the
psychic
prenatal
conditions
which
a
mother
consciously
or
unconsciously
may
set
up
if
this
interpretation
as
it
seems
to
be
is
correct
we
have
in
this
welsh
belief
a
surprising
comprehension
of
scientific
laws
on
the
part
of
the
ancient
welsh
druids
from
whom
the
doctrine
comes
which
equals
and
surpasses
in
its
subtlety
the
latest
discoveries
of

corrupted
after

among
certain
cornish

in

the
primitive
character
of

doctrine
is
clear
origen
in
refuting
a
jewish
accusation
against

apparently
the
natural
outgrowth
of
hatred

religious
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
jews
that
jesus
christ
was
born
through
the
adultery
of
the

with
a
certain
soldier
named

argues
every
soul
for
certain
mysterious
reasons
i
speak
now
according
to
the
opinions
of
pythagoras
and
plato
and
empedocles
whom
celsus
frequently
names
is
introduced
into
a
body
and
introduced
according
to
its
deserts
and
former
actions
and
according
to
origen
argument
to
assign
to
jesus
christ
a
birth
more
disgraceful
than
any
other
is
absurd
because
who
sends
souls
down
into
the
bodies
of
men
would
not
have
thus
him
who
was
to
dare
such
mighty
acts
and
to
teach
so
many
men
and
to
reform
so
many
from
the
mass
of
wickedness
in
the
world
and
origen
adds
is
probable
therefore
that
this
soul
also
which
conferred
more
benefit
by
its
residence
in
the
flesh
than
that
of
many
men
to
avoid
prejudice

only
superior

it
is
interesting
to
compare
with

theology
the
following
passage
from
the
wherein

alleged
esoteric
discourse
to
his
disciples
refers
to
the
of
their
souls
took
them
from
the
hands
of
the
twelve
saviours
of
the
treasure
of
light
according
to
the
command

powers

me

there
exists
a
theory
parallel
to
this
one
arrived
at
through
careful
scientific
research
namely
that
ghosts
haunt

and
monuments
connected

according

a

coin

coin
was

is
on
the
south
side
about
fifteen
inches
above
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
menhir
is
very
tall
and
smoothly
rounded
and
there
is
no
possible
way
for
the
coin
to
have
fallen
into
the
fissure
by
accident
nor
is
there
any
probability
that
the
coin
was
placed
there
without
a
serious
purpose
and
it
is
an
object
such
as
only
an
adult
would
possess
an
examination
of
the
link
remaining
on
the
coin
which
no
doubt
formerly
connected
it
with
a
necklace
or
string
of
shows
that
it
has
been
purposely
opened
so
as
to
free
it
at
the
time
it
was
deposited
in
the
stone
had
the
coin
been
accidentally
torn
away
from
a
chain
or
string
of
the
link
would
have
presented
a
different
sort
of
opening
but
it
would
be
altogether
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
by
any
sort
of
chance
the
coin
could
have
reached
the
place
where
i
found
it
i
showed
the
coin
to
z
le
rouzic
of
the
carnac
museum
and
he
considers
it
as
i
do
as
evidence
or
proof
of
a
cult
rendered
to
stones
here
in
brittany
the
coin
must
have
been
secretly
placed
in
the
menhir
by
some
pious
peasant
as
a
direct
for
some
favour
received
or
demanded
the
coin
is
somewhat
discoloured
and
has
probably
been
some
years
in
the
stone
though
it
can
not
be
very
old
and
the
offering
of
a
coin
to
the
spirit
residing
in
a
menhir
is
parallel
to
throwing
coins
pins
or
other
objects
into
sacred
fountains
which
as
we
know
is
an
undisputed
practice

very
much
evidence
suggests
that
the

was
regarded
by
the
primitive

both
as
an

as
a
seat
of
divine
power
and
as
a
phallic
symbol
cf
jubainville

des

as
a
phallic
symbol
the
menhir
must
have
been
inseparably
related
to
a
celtic
because
among
all
ancient
peoples
where
phallic
worship
has
prevailed
the
sun
has
been
venerated
as
the
supreme
masculine
force
in

which
all

for

while

respects
it

a

this
origin
seems
on
the
evidence

to
have
been
a
restoration
an
expansion

chiefly
a
christianization
of
prehistoric
rites
then
already
partly
fallen

such
rites
remained
latent
in

were
originally
celebrated
in
honour
of
the

probably
also
of

the

was
ploughed
up
in

nicolas

naturally
regarded
by
him

all
who
saw
it
as
of
anne

the
holy
child
thus
in
the
pardon
of
anne
which
extends
over
three
days
there
is
a
procession
at

under
ecclesiastical
sanction
as
in

there
are
purification
rites
not

at

the

the

parallel

our

us

the

mythical
aspect

exists
a
substantial
substratum

real

the
foundation
underlying

this

the

we

it

applies
to
all

the

hypothesis

the

statement
will
make
our
position
towards
mediumship
of
the
most
common
kind
clear
in
druidism
for
one
example
disciples
for
training
in

sciences
are
said
to
have
spent
twenty
years
in
severe
study
and
special
psychical
training
before
deemed
fit
to
be
called
druids
and
thus
to
control
daemons
ghosts
or
all
invisible
entities
capable
of
possessing
living
men
and
women
and
even
now
in
india
and
elsewhere
there
is
reported
to
be
still
the
same
ancient
course
of
severe
disciplinary
training
for
candidates
seeking
magical
powers
but
in
modern
spiritualism
conditions
are
altogether
different
in
most
cases
and
instead
of
controlling
with
an
iron
will
as
a
magician
does
spirits
which
become
manifest
in
surrender
entirely
their
and
whole
personality
to
them

the
fact
that

conclusion

this
celtic
view
of
immortality
completely
fits
in
with
all
the
voluminous
data
of
psychical
research
after
forty
years
of
scientific
research
into
psychics
there
are
no
proofs
yet
adduced
that
the
human
personality
as
a
unit
of
consciousness
survives
indefinitely
the
death
of
its
body
granted
that
it
does
survive
as
a
ghost
for
an
undetermined
period
generally
to
be
counted
in
years
during
which
time
it
seems
to
be
gradually
fading
out
or
disintegrating
there
is
no
reliable
evidence
anywhere
to
show
that
a
personality
has
manifested
through
a
or
otherwise
after
an
interval
of
one
thousand
years
or
even
of
five
hundred
years
we
have
in
fact
no
knowledge
of
the
survival
of
a
human
personality
one
hundred
years
after
and
probably
there
are
no
good
examples
of
such
a
survival
years
after
the
death
of
the
body
such
an
eminent
psychical
researcher
as
william
james
recognized
this
drift
of
the
data
of
psychics
and
when
he
died
he
held
the
conviction
that
there
is
no
personal
immortality
see
following
though
not
inclined
toward
the
vitalistic
view
of
human
evolution
th
ribot
very
closely
approaches
the
celtic
view
of
the
ego
or
individuality
as
being
the
principle
which
gives
unity
to
different
personalities
but
he
does
not
have
in
mind
personalities
in
the
sense
implied
by
the
celtic
esoteric
doctrine
of
ego
subjectively
considered
consists
of
a
sum
of
conscious
comparable
to
personalities
brief
the
ego
may
be
considered
in
two
ways
either
in
its
actual
form
and
then
it
is
the
sum
of
existing
conscious
states
or
in
its
continuity
with
the
past
and
then
it
is
formed
by
the
memory
according
to
the
process
outlined
above
it
would
seem
according
to
this
view
that
the
identity
of
the
ego
depended
entirely
upon
the
memory
but
such
a
conception
is
only
partial
beneath
the
unstable
compound
phenomenon
in
all
its
protean
phases
of
growth
degeneration
and
reproduction
there
is
a
something
that
remains
and
this
something
is
the
undefined
consciousness

product

all
the
vital
processes
constituting
bodily
perception

william

the
greatest
psychologist
of
our
epoch
after
a
long
and
faithful
life
consecrated
to
the
search
after
a
true
understanding
of
human
consciousness
finally
arrived
at
substantially
the
same
conviction
as
fechner
did
that
there
is
no
personal
immortality
but
that
the
personality
but
a
temporary
and
partial
separation
and
circumscription
of
a
part
of
a
larger
whole
into
which
it
is
reabsorbed
at
death
mcdougall

of
william
in

lxii

he
thus
virtually
accepted
the
mystic
view
that
the
personality
after
the
death
of
the
body
is
absorbed
into
a
higher
power
which
to
our
mind
is
comparable
with
the
ego
conceived
as
the
unifying
principle
behind
personalities
in
one
of
his
last
writings
james
explained
his
belief
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
coincide
at
certain
points
with
the
view
held
by
modern
celtic
mystics
which
has
been
presented
above
the
difference
being
that
unlike
these
mystics
james
was
not
prepared
to
say
though
he
raised
the
question
whether
or
not
behind
the
of
consciousness
there
is
as
fechner
believed
a
hierarchy
of
consciousnesses
themselves
subordinate
to
still
higher
consciousnesses
and
comparable
with
so
many
egos
or
individualities
which
send
out
emanations
as
temporary
human
personalities
the
organic
psychical
forms
if
we
may
use
such
an
expression
of
such
temporary
human
personalities
would
have
to
be
regarded
from
james
point
of
view
as
being
built
up
out
of
the
psychical
elements
constituting
the
of
consciousness
just
as
the
human
body
is
built
up
out
of
the
physical
elements
in
the
realm
of
matter
of
my
experience
such
as
it
is
and
it
is
limited
enough
one
fixed
conclusion
dogmatically
emerges
and
that
is
this
that
we
with
our
lives
are
like
islands
in
the
sea
or
like
trees
in
the
forest
the
maple
and
the
pine
may
whisper
to
each
other
with
their
leaves
and
conanicut
and
newport
hear
each
other
foghorns
but
the
trees
also
commingle
their
roots
in
the
darkness
underground
and
the
islands
also
hang
together
through
the
ocean
bottom
just
so
there
is
a
continuum
of
cosmic
consciousness
against
which
our
used
as
synonymous
with
personality
and
not
in
our
distinct
sense
but
accidental
fences
and
into
which
our
several
minds
plunge
as
into
a
or
reservoir
our
normal
consciousness
the
personality
as
we
distinguish
it
from
the
ego
or
individuality
circumscribed
for
adaptation
to
our
external
earthly
environment
but
the
fence
is
weak
in
spots
and
fitful
influences
from
beyond
break
in
showing
the
otherwise
unverifiable
common
connexion
not
only
psychic
research
but
metaphysical
philosophy
and
speculative
biology
are
led
in
their
own
ways
to
look
with

some

kind
whether

may
be
due
to
the

collected

over
from
a
previous
state
of

parallel

respect

professor

holds
as
a
result

of

subjects
that
the
latent
content
of
every
dream
in
the

mental
processes

is
always
a

the
esoteric
teaching
in

of

of
antiquity
was
that
the
atoms

body
transmigrate
through
all
lower
forms
of
life
during
the
long
period
supposed
to
intervene
between

and

this
doctrine
seems
to
be
one
of
the
main
sources
of
the
corruption
which
crept
into
the
ancient
doctrines
and
transformed
many
of
them
into
doctrines
of
transmigration
of
the
human
soul
into
animal
and
plant
bodies
and
some
unscrupulous
priesthoods
openly
taught
such
corrupted
doctrines
as
a
means
of
making
the
ignorant
populace
submissive
to
ecclesiastical
rule
the
theological
theory
expounded
by
such
priesthoods
being
that
the
but
not
the
keeper
of
the
letter
of
the
canonical
law
is
condemned
to
expiate
his
sins
through
birth
in
brute
bodies
the
pure
form
of
the
mystic
doctrine
was
that
after
the
lapse
of
the
long
period
of
disembodiment
the
individuality
reconstructs
its
human
body
anew
by
drawing
to
itself
the
identical
atoms
which
constituted
its
previous
human
body
these
atoms
and
not
the
individuality
having
transmigrated
through
all
the
lower
kingdoms
such
an
esoteric
doctrine
probably
lies
behind
the
exoteric
egyptian
teaching
that
the
human
soul
after
the
death
of
its
body
passes
through
all
plant
and
animal
bodies
during
a
period
of
three
thousand
years
after
which
it
returns
to
human
embodiment
some
scholars
have
held
that
the
exoteric
interpretation
of
this
theory
and
its
consequent
literal
interpretation
as
a
transmigration
doctrine
led
