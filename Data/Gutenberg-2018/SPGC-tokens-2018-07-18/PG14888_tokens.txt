chapter
one
ideas
she
said
oh
as
for
ideas
well
i
hazarded
as
for
ideas
we
went
through
the
old
gateway
and
i
cast
a
glance
over
my
shoulder
the
noon
sun
was
shining
over
the
masonry
over
the
little
effigies
over
the
little
fretted
canopies
the
grime
and
the
white
streaks
of
there
i
said
pointing
toward
it
does
that
suggest
something
to
you
she
made
a
motion
with
her
head
half
negative
half
contemptuous
but
i
stuttered
the
associations
the
ideas
the
historical
ideas
she
said
nothing
you
americans
i
began
but
her
smile
stopped
me
it
was
as
if
she
were
amused
at
the
utterances
of
an
old
lady
shocked
by
the
habits
of
the
daughters
of
the
day
it
was
the
smile
of
a
person
who
is
confident
of
superseding
one
fatally
in
conversations
of
any
length
one
of
the
parties
assumes
the
superiority
superiority
of
rank
intellectual
or
social
in
this
conversation
she
if
she
did
not
attain
to
tacitly
acknowledged
temperamental
superiority
seemed
at
least
to
claim
it
to
have
no
doubt
as
to
its
ultimate
according
i
was
unused
to
this
i
was
a
talker
proud
of
my
conversational
powers
i
had
looked
at
her
before
now
i
cast
a
sideways
critical
glance
at
her
i
came
out
of
my
moodiness
to
wonder
what
type
this
was
she
had
good
hair
good
eyes
and
some
charm
yes
and
something
besides
a
something
a
something
that
was
not
an
attribute
of
her
beauty
the
modelling
of
her
face
was
so
perfect
and
so
delicate
as
to
produce
an
effect
of
transparency
yet
there
was
no
suggestion
of
frailness
her
glance
had
an
extraordinary
strength
of
life
her
hair
was
fair
and
gleaming
her
cheeks
coloured
as
if
a
warm
light
had
fallen
on
them
from
somewhere
she
was
familiar
till
it
occurred
to
you
that
she
was
strange
which
way
are
you
going
she
asked
i
am
going
to
walk
to
dover
i
answered
and
i
may
come
with
you
i
looked
at
her
intent
on
divining
her
in
that
one
glance
it
was
of
course
impossible
there
will
be
time
for
analysis
i
thought
the
roads
are
free
to
all
i
said
you
are
not
an
american
she
shook
her
head
no
she
was
not
an
australian
either
she
came
from
none
of
the
british
colonies
you
are
not
english
i
affirmed
you
speak
too
well
i
was
piqued
she
did
not
answer
she
smiled
again
and
i
grew
angry
in
the
cathedral
she
had
smiled
at
the
verger
commendation
of
particularly
abominable
restorations
and
that
smile
had
drawn
me
toward
her
had
emboldened
me
to
offer
deferential
and
condemnatory
remarks
as
to
the
mouldings
you
know
how
one
addresses
a
young
lady
who
is
obviously
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
that
was
how
i
had
come
across
her
she
had
smiled
at
the
gabble
of
the
cathedral
guide
as
he
showed
the
obsessed
troop
of
which
we
had
formed
units
the
place
of
martyrdom
of
blessed
thomas
and
her
smile
had
had
just
that
quality
of
contempt
it
had
pleased
me
then
but
now
that
she
smiled
thus
past
me
it
was
not
quite
at
me
in
the
crooked
highways
of
the
town
i
was
irritated
after
all
i
was
somebody
i
was
not
a
cathedral
verger
i
had
a
fancy
for
myself
in
those
days
a
fancy
that
solitude
and
brooding
had
crystallised
into
a
habit
of
mind
i
was
a
writer
with
high
with
the
highest
ideals
i
had
withdrawn
myself
from
the
world
lived
isolated
hidden
in
the
countryside
lived
as
hermits
do
on
the
hope
of
one
day
doing
something
of
putting
greatness
on
paper
she
suddenly
fathomed
my
thoughts
you
write
she
affirmed
i
asked
how
she
knew
wondered
what
she
had
read
of
mine
there
was
so
little
are
you
a
popular
author
she
asked
alas
no
i
answered
you
must
know
that
you
would
like
to
be
we
should
all
of
us
like
i
answered
though
it
is
true
some
of
us
protest
that
we
aim
for
higher
things
i
see
she
said
musingly
as
far
as
i
could
tell
she
was
coming
to
some
decision
with
an
instinctive
dislike
to
any
such
proceeding
as
regarded
myself
i
tried
to
cut
across
her
unknown
thoughts
but
really
i
said
i
am
quite
a
commonplace
topic
let
us
talk
about
yourself
where
do
you
come
from
it
occurred
to
me
again
that
i
was
intensely
unacquainted
with
her
type
here
was
the
same
smile
as
far
as
i
could
see
exactly
the
same
smile
there
are
fine
shades
in
smiles
as
in
laughs
as
in
tones
of
voice
i
seemed
unable
to
hold
my
tongue
where
do
you
come
from
i
asked
you
must
belong
to
one
of
the
new
nations
you
are
a
foreigner
i
swear
because
you
have
such
a
fine
contempt
for
us
you
irritate
me
so
that
you
might
almost
be
a
prussian
but
it
is
obvious
that
you
are
of
a
new
nation
that
is
beginning
to
find
itself
oh
we
are
to
inherit
the
earth
if
that
is
what
you
mean
she
said
the
phrase
is
comprehensive
i
said
i
was
determined
not
to
give
myself
away
where
in
the
world
do
you
come
from
i
repeated
the
question
i
was
quite
conscious
would
have
sufficed
but
in
the
hope
i
suppose
of
establishing
my
intellectual
superiority
i
continued
you
know
fair
play
a
jewel
now
i
quite
willing
to
give
you
information
as
to
myself
i
have
already
told
you
the
essentials
you
ought
to
tell
me
something
it
would
only
be
fair
play
why
should
there
be
any
fair
play
she
asked
what
have
you
to
say
against
that
i
said
do
you
not
number
it
among
your
national
characteristics
you
really
wish
to
know
where
i
come
from
i
expressed
acquiescence
listen
she
said
and
uttered
some
sounds
i
felt
a
kind
of
unholy
emotion
it
had
come
like
a
sudden
suddenly
hushed
intense
gust
of
wind
through
a
breathless
day
what
what
i
cried
i
said
i
inhabit
the
fourth
dimension
i
recovered
my
equanimity
with
the
thought
that
i
had
been
visited
by
some
stroke
of
an
obscure
and
unimportant
physical
kind
i
think
we
must
have
been
climbing
the
hill
too
fast
for
me
i
said
i
have
not
been
very
well
i
missed
what
you
said
i
was
certainly
out
of
breath
i
said
i
inhabit
the
fourth
dimension
she
repeated
with
admirable
gravity
oh
come
i
expostulated
this
is
playing
it
rather
low
down
you
walk
a
convalescent
out
of
breath
and
then
propound
riddles
to
him
i
was
recovering
my
breath
and
with
it
my
inclination
to
expand
instead
i
looked
at
her
i
was
beginning
to
understand
it
was
obvious
enough
that
she
was
a
foreigner
in
a
strange
land
in
a
land
that
brought
out
her
national
characteristics
she
must
be
of
some
race
perhaps
semitic
perhaps
sclav
of
some
incomprehensible
race
i
had
never
seen
a
circassian
and
there
used
to
be
a
tradition
that
circassian
women
were
beautiful
were
and
so
on
what
was
repelling
in
her
was
accounted
for
by
this
difference
in
national
point
of
view
one
is
after
all
not
so
very
remote
from
the
horse
what
one
does
not
understand
one
shies
at
finds
sinister
in
fact
and
she
struck
me
as
sinister
you
wo
tell
me
who
you
are
i
said
i
have
done
so
she
answered
if
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
inhabit
a
mathematical
monstrosity
you
are
mistaken
you
are
really
she
turned
round
and
pointed
at
the
city
look
she
said
we
had
climbed
the
western
hill
below
our
feet
beneath
a
sky
that
the
wind
had
swept
clean
of
clouds
was
the
valley
a
broad
bowl
shallow
filled
with
the
purple
of
and
above
the
mass
of
red
roofs
there
soared
the
golden
stonework
of
the
cathedral
tower
it
was
a
vision
the
last
word
of
a
great
art
i
looked
at
her
i
was
moved
and
i
knew
that
the
glory
of
it
must
have
moved
her
she
was
smiling
look
she
repeated
i
looked
there
was
the
purple
and
the
red
and
the
golden
tower
the
vision
the
last
word
she
said
something
uttered
some
sound
what
had
happened
i
do
know
it
all
looked
contemptible
one
seemed
to
see
something
beyond
something
vaster
vaster
than
cathedrals
vaster
than
the
conception
of
the
gods
to
whom
cathedrals
were
raised
the
tower
reeled
out
of
the
perpendicular
one
saw
beyond
it
not
roofs
or
smoke
or
hills
but
an
unrealised
an
unrealisable
infinity
of
space
it
was
merely
momentary
the
tower
filled
its
place
again
and
i
looked
at
her
what
the
devil
i
said
hysterically
what
the
devil
do
you
play
these
tricks
upon
me
for
you
see
she
answered
the
rudiments
of
the
sense
are
there
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
fail
to
understand
i
said
grasping
after
fragments
of
dropped
dignity
i
am
subject
to
fits
of
giddiness
i
felt
a
need
for
covering
a
species
of
nakedness
pardon
my
swearing
i
added
a
proof
of
recovered
equanimity
we
resumed
the
road
in
silence
i
was
physically
and
mentally
shaken
and
i
tried
to
deceive
myself
as
to
the
cause
after
some
time
i
said
you
insist
then
in
preserving
your
your
incognito
oh
i
make
no
mystery
of
myself
she
answered
you
have
told
me
that
you
come
from
the
fourth
dimension
i
remarked
ironically
i
come
from
the
fourth
dimension
she
said
patiently
she
had
the
air
of
one
in
a
position
of
difficulty
of
one
aware
of
it
and
ready
to
brave
it
she
had
the
listlessness
of
an
enlightened
person
who
has
to
explain
over
and
over
again
to
stupid
children
some
rudimentary
point
of
the
multiplication
table
she
seemed
to
divine
my
thoughts
to
be
aware
of
their
very
wording
she
even
said
yes
at
the
opening
of
her
next
speech
yes
she
said
it
is
as
if
i
were
to
try
to
explain
the
new
ideas
of
any
age
to
a
person
of
the
age
that
has
gone
before
she
paused
seeking
a
concrete
illustration
that
would
touch
me
as
if
i
were
explaining
to
johnson
the
methods
and
the
ultimate
vogue
of
the
cockney
school
of
poetry
i
understand
i
said
that
you
wish
me
to
consider
myself
as
relatively
a
choctaw
but
what
i
do
not
understand
is
what
bearing
that
has
upon
upon
the
fourth
dimension
i
think
you
said
i
will
explain
she
replied
but
you
must
explain
as
if
you
were
explaining
to
a
choctaw
i
said
pleasantly
you
must
be
concise
and
convincing
she
answered
i
will
she
made
a
long
speech
of
it
i
condense
i
ca
remember
her
exact
words
there
were
so
many
but
she
spoke
like
a
book
there
was
something
exquisitely
piquant
in
her
choice
of
words
in
her
expressionless
voice
i
seemed
to
be
listening
to
a
phonograph
reciting
a
technical
work
there
was
a
touch
of
the
incongruous
of
the
mad
that
appealed
to
me
the
commonplace
landscape
the
straight
white
undulating
road
that
from
the
tops
of
rises
one
saw
running
for
miles
and
miles
straight
straight
and
so
white
filtering
down
through
the
great
blue
of
the
sky
came
the
thrilling
of
innumerable
skylarks
and
i
was
listening
to
a
parody
of
a
scientific
work
recited
by
a
phonograph
i
heard
the
nature
of
the
fourth
dimension
heard
that
it
was
an
inhabited
plane
invisible
to
our
eyes
but
omnipresent
heard
that
i
had
seen
it
when
bell
harry
had
reeled
before
my
eyes
i
heard
the
dimensionists
described
a
race
eminently
practical
incredible
with
no
ideals
prejudices
or
remorse
with
no
feeling
for
art
and
no
reverence
for
life
free
from
any
ethical
tradition
callous
to
pain
weakness
suffering
and
death
as
if
they
had
been
invulnerable
and
immortal
she
did
not
say
that
they
were
immortal
however
you
would
you
will
hate
us
she
concluded
and
i
seemed
only
then
to
come
to
myself
the
power
of
her
imagination
was
so
great
that
i
fancied
myself
face
to
face
with
the
truth
i
supposed
she
had
been
amusing
herself
that
she
should
have
tried
to
frighten
me
was
inadmissible
i
do
pretend
that
i
was
completely
at
my
ease
but
i
said
amiably
you
certainly
have
succeeded
in
making
these
beings
hateful
i
have
made
nothing
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
and
went
on
amusing
herself
she
would
explain
origins
now
your
she
used
the
word
as
signifying
i
suppose
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
or
the
populations
of
the
earth
your
ancestors
were
mine
but
long
ago
you
were
crowded
out
of
the
dimension
as
we
are
you
overran
the
earth
as
we
shall
do
but
you
contracted
diseases
as
we
shall
contract
them
beliefs
traditions
fears
ideas
of
pity
of
love
you
grew
luxurious
in
the
worship
of
your
ideals
and
sorrowful
you
solaced
yourselves
with
creeds
with
arts
you
have
forgotten
she
spoke
with
calm
conviction
with
an
overwhelming
and
dispassionate
assurance
she
was
stating
facts
not
professing
a
faith
we
approached
a
little
roadside
inn
on
a
bench
before
the
door
a
country
fellow
was
asleep
his
head
on
the
table
put
your
fingers
in
your
ears
my
companion
commanded
i
humoured
her
i
saw
her
lips
move
the
countryman
started
shuddered
and
by
a
clumsy
convulsive
motion
of
his
arms
upset
his
quart
he
rubbed
his
eyes
before
he
had
voiced
his
emotions
we
had
passed
on
i
have
seen
a
do
as
much
for
a
stallion
i
commented
i
know
there
are
words
that
have
certain
effects
but
you
should
play
pranks
like
the
devil
in
faustus
it
is
good
form
i
suppose
she
sneered
it
a
matter
of
feeling
i
said
hotly
the
poor
fellow
has
lost
his
beer
what
that
to
me
she
commented
with
the
air
of
one
affording
a
concrete
illustration
it
a
good
deal
to
him
i
answered
but
what
to
me
i
said
nothing
she
ceased
her
exposition
immediately
afterward
growing
silent
as
suddenly
as
she
had
become
discoursive
it
was
rather
as
if
she
had
learnt
a
speech
by
heart
and
had
come
to
the
end
of
it
i
was
quite
at
a
loss
as
to
what
she
was
driving
at
there
was
a
newness
a
strangeness
about
her
sometimes
she
struck
me
as
mad
sometimes
as
frightfully
sane
we
had
a
meal
somewhere
a
meal
that
broke
the
current
of
her
speech
and
then
in
the
late
afternoon
took
a
and
wandered
in
secluded
valleys
i
had
been
ill
trouble
of
the
nerves
brooding
the
monotony
of
life
in
the
shadow
of
unsuccess
i
had
an
errand
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
had
been
approaching
it
deviously
seeking
the
normal
in
its
quiet
hollows
trying
to
get
back
to
my
old
self
i
did
not
wish
to
think
of
how
i
should
get
through
the
year
of
the
thousand
little
things
that
matter
so
i
talked
and
she
she
listened
very
well
but
topics
exhaust
themselves
and
at
the
last
i
myself
brought
the
talk
round
to
the
fourth
dimension
we
were
sauntering
along
the
forgotten
valley
that
lies
between
hardves
and
stelling
minnis
we
had
been
silent
for
several
minutes
for
me
at
least
the
silence
was
pregnant
with
the
undefinable
emotions
that
at
times
run
in
currents
between
man
and
woman
the
sun
was
getting
low
and
it
was
shadowy
in
those
shrouded
hollows
i
laughed
at
some
thought
i
forget
what
and
then
began
to
badger
her
with
questions
i
tried
to
exhaust
the
possibilities
of
the
dimensionist
idea
made
grotesque
suggestions
i
said
and
when
a
great
many
of
you
have
been
crowded
out
of
the
dimension
and
invaded
the
earth
you
will
do
so
and
so
something
preposterous
and
ironical
she
coldly
dissented
and
at
once
the
irony
appeared
as
gross
as
the
jocularity
of
a
commercial
traveller
sometimes
she
signified
yes
that
is
what
we
shall
do
signified
it
without
speaking
by
some
gesture
perhaps
i
hardly
know
what
there
was
something
impressive
something
almost
regal
in
this
manner
of
hers
it
was
rather
frightening
in
those
lonely
places
which
were
so
forgotten
so
gray
so
closed
in
there
was
something
of
the
past
world
about
the
hanging
woods
the
little
veils
of
unmoving
mist
as
if
time
did
not
exist
in
those
furrows
of
the
great
world
and
one
was
so
absolutely
alone
anything
might
have
happened
i
grew
weary
of
the
sound
of
my
tongue
but
when
i
wanted
to
cease
i
found
she
had
on
me
the
effect
of
some
incredible
stimulant
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
valley
where
the
road
begins
to
climb
the
southern
hill
out
into
the
open
air
i
managed
to
maintain
an
uneasy
silence
from
her
grimly
dispassionate
reiterations
i
had
attained
to
a
clear
idea
even
to
a
visualisation
of
her
fantastic
conception
allegory
madness
or
whatever
it
was
she
certainly
forced
it
home
the
dimensionists
were
to
come
in
swarms
to
materialise
to
devour
like
locusts
to
be
all
the
more
irresistible
because
indistinguishable
they
were
to
come
like
snow
in
the
night
in
the
morning
one
would
look
out
and
find
the
world
white
they
were
to
come
as
the
gray
hairs
come
to
sap
the
strength
of
us
as
the
years
sap
the
strength
of
the
muscles
as
to
methods
we
should
be
treated
as
we
ourselves
treat
the
inferior
races
there
would
be
no
fighting
no
killing
we
our
whole
social
system
would
break
as
a
beam
snaps
because
we
were
with
altruism
and
ethics
we
at
our
worst
had
a
certain
limit
a
certain
stage
where
we
exclaimed
no
this
is
playing
it
too
low
down
because
we
had
scruples
that
acted
like
handicapping
weights
she
uttered
i
think
only
two
sentences
of
connected
words
we
shall
race
with
you
and
we
shall
not
be
weighted
and
we
shall
merely
sink
you
lower
by
our
weight
all
the
rest
went
like
this
but
then
i
would
say
we
shall
not
be
able
to
trust
anyone
anyone
may
be
one
of
you
she
would
answer
anyone
she
prophesied
a
reign
of
terror
for
us
as
one
passed
one
neighbour
in
the
street
one
would
cast
sudden
piercing
glances
at
him
i
was
silent
the
birds
were
singing
the
sun
down
it
was
very
dark
among
the
branches
and
from
minute
to
minute
the
colours
of
the
world
deepened
and
grew
sombre
but
i
said
a
feeling
of
unrest
was
creeping
over
me
but
why
do
you
tell
me
all
this
i
asked
do
you
think
i
will
enlist
with
you
you
will
have
to
in
the
end
she
said
and
i
do
not
wish
to
waste
my
strength
if
you
had
to
work
unwittingly
you
would
resist
and
resist
and
resist
i
should
have
to
waste
my
power
on
you
as
it
is
you
will
resist
only
at
first
then
you
will
begin
to
understand
you
will
see
how
we
will
bring
a
man
down
a
man
you
understand
with
a
great
name
standing
for
probity
and
honour
you
will
see
the
nets
drawing
closer
and
closer
and
you
will
begin
to
understand
then
you
will
cease
resisting
that
is
all
i
was
silent
a
june
nightingale
began
to
sing
a
trifle
hoarsely
we
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
signal
the
things
of
the
night
came
and
went
rustled
through
the
grass
rustled
through
the
leafage
at
last
i
could
not
even
see
the
white
gleam
of
her
face
i
stretched
out
my
hand
and
it
touched
hers
i
seized
it
without
an
instant
of
hesitation
how
could
i
resist
you
i
said
and
heard
my
own
whisper
with
a
kind
of
amazement
at
its
emotion
i
raised
her
hand
it
was
very
cold
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
thought
of
resistance
but
before
it
touched
my
lips
something
like
a
panic
of
prudence
had
overcome
me
i
did
not
know
what
it
would
lead
to
and
i
remembered
that
i
did
not
even
know
who
she
was
from
the
beginning
she
had
struck
me
as
sinister
and
now
in
the
obscurity
her
silence
and
her
coldness
seemed
to
be
a
passive
threatening
of
unknown
entanglement
i
let
her
hand
fall
we
must
be
getting
on
i
said
the
road
was
shrouded
and
overhung
by
branches
there
was
a
kind
of
translucent
light
enough
to
see
her
face
but
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
ground
i
was
vexed
now
that
it
was
past
the
episode
appeared
to
be
a
lost
opportunity
we
were
to
part
in
a
moment
and
her
rare
mental
gifts
and
her
unfamiliar
but
very
vivid
beauty
made
the
idea
of
parting
intensely
disagreeable
she
had
filled
me
with
a
curiosity
that
she
had
done
nothing
whatever
to
satisfy
and
with
a
fascination
that
was
very
nearly
a
fear
we
mounted
the
hill
and
came
out
on
a
stretch
of
soft
common
sward
then
the
sound
of
our
footsteps
ceased
and
the
world
grew
more
silent
than
ever
there
were
little
enclosed
fields
all
round
us
the
moon
threw
a
wan
light
and
gleaming
mist
hung
in
the
ragged
hedges
broad
soft
roads
ran
away
into
space
on
every
side
and
now
i
asked
at
last
shall
we
ever
meet
again
my
voice
came
huskily
as
if
i
had
not
spoken
for
years
and
years
oh
very
often
she
answered
very
often
i
repeated
i
hardly
knew
whether
i
was
pleased
or
dismayed
through
the
in
a
hedge
i
caught
a
glimmer
of
a
white
house
front
it
seemed
to
belong
to
another
world
to
another
order
of
things
ah
here
is
callan
i
said
this
is
where
i
was
going
i
know
she
answered
we
part
here
to
meet
again
i
asked
oh
to
meet
again
why
yes
to
meet
again
chapter
two
her
figure
faded
into
the
darkness
as
pale
things
waver
down
into
deep
water
and
as
soon
as
she
disappeared
my
sense
of
humour
returned
the
episode
appeared
more
clearly
as
a
flirtation
with
an
enigmatic
but
decidedly
charming
chance
travelling
companion
the
girl
was
a
riddle
and
a
riddle
once
guessed
is
a
very
trivial
thing
she
too
would
be
a
very
trivial
thing
when
i
had
found
a
solution
it
occurred
to
me
that
she
wished
me
to
regard
her
as
a
symbol
perhaps
of
the
future
as
a
type
of
those
who
are
to
inherit
the
earth
in
fact
she
had
been
playing
the
fool
with
me
in
her
insolent
modernity
she
had
wished
me
to
understand
that
i
was
that
the
frame
of
mind
of
which
i
and
my
fellows
were
the
inheritors
was
over
and
done
with
we
were
to
be
compulsorily
retired
to
stand
aside
superannuated
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
better
equipped
for
the
swiftness
of
life
she
had
a
something
not
only
quickness
of
wit
not
only
ruthless
determination
but
a
something
quite
different
and
quite
indefinably
more
impressive
perhaps
it
was
only
the
confidence
of
the
superseder
the
essential
quality
that
makes
for
the
empire
of
the
occidental
but
i
was
not
a
negro
not
even
relatively
a
hindoo
i
was
somebody
confound
it
i
was
somebody
as
an
author
i
had
been
so
uniformly
unsuccessful
so
absolutely
unrecognised
that
i
had
got
into
the
way
of
regarding
myself
as
ahead
of
my
time
as
a
worker
for
posterity
it
was
a
habit
of
mind
the
only
revenge
that
i
could
take
upon
despiteful
fate
this
girl
came
to
confound
me
with
the
common
herd
she
declared
herself
to
be
that
very
posterity
for
which
i
worked
she
was
probably
a
member
of
some
clique
that
called
themselves
fourth
dimensionists
just
as
there
had
been
it
was
a
matter
of
cant
allegory
i
began
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
i
had
never
heard
of
them
and
how
on
earth
had
they
come
to
hear
of
me
she
must
have
read
something
of
mine
i
found
myself
musing
the
jenkins
story
perhaps
it
must
have
been
the
jenkins
story
they
gave
it
a
good
place
in
their
rotten
magazine
she
must
have
seen
that
it
was
the
real
thing
and
when
one
is
an
author
one
looks
at
things
in
that
way
you
know
by
that
time
i
was
ready
to
knock
at
the
door
of
the
great
callan
i
seemed
to
be
jerked
into
the
commonplace
medium
of
a
great
great
oh
an
infinitely
great
novelist
home
life
i
was
led
into
a
welcomed
by
the
great
man
wife
gently
propelled
into
a
bedroom
made
myself
tidy
descended
and
was
introduced
into
the
sanctum
before
my
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
callan
was
seated
upon
his
sofa
surrounded
by
an
admiring
crowd
of
very
local
personages
i
forget
what
they
looked
like
i
think
there
was
a
man
whose
reddish
beard
did
not
become
him
and
another
whose
face
might
have
been
improved
by
the
addition
of
a
reddish
beard
there
was
also
an
extremely
moody
dark
man
and
i
vaguely
recollect
a
person
who
lisped
they
did
not
talk
much
indeed
there
was
very
little
conversation
what
there
was
callan
supplied
he
spoke
very
slowly
and
very
authoritatively
like
a
great
actor
whose
aim
is
to
hold
the
stage
as
long
as
possible
the
raising
of
his
heavy
eyelids
at
the
opening
door
conveyed
the
impression
of
a
dark
mental
weariness
and
seemed
somehow
to
give
additional
length
to
his
white
nose
his
short
brown
beard
was
getting
very
grey
i
thought
with
his
lofty
forehead
and
with
his
superior
yet
propitiatory
smile
i
was
of
course
familiar
indeed
one
saw
them
on
posters
in
the
street
the
notables
did
not
want
to
talk
they
wanted
to
be
and
they
were
callan
sat
there
in
an
appropriate
attitude
the
one
in
which
he
was
always
photographed
one
hand
supported
his
head
the
other
toyed
with
his
his
face
was
uniformly
solemn
but
his
eyes
were
disconcertingly
furtive
he
me
as
to
my
walk
from
canterbury
remarked
that
the
cathedral
was
a
magnificent
gothic
monument
and
set
me
right
as
to
the
lie
of
the
roads
he
seemed
pleased
to
find
that
i
remembered
very
little
of
what
i
ought
to
have
noticed
on
the
way
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
for
the
display
of
his
local
erudition
a
remarkable
woman
used
to
live
in
the
cottage
next
the
mill
at
stelling
he
said
she
was
the
original
of
kate
wingfield
in
your
the
chorus
chorussed
remembrance
of
the
common
at
stelling
of
the
glimmering
white
faces
of
the
shadowy
cottages
was
like
a
cold
waft
of
mist
to
me
i
forgot
to
say
indeed
she
was
a
very
remarkable
woman
she
i
found
myself
wondering
which
was
real
the
common
with
its
misty
hedges
and
the
blurred
moon
or
this
room
with
its
ranks
of
uniformly
bound
books
and
its
bust
of
the
great
man
that
threw
a
portentous
shadow
upward
from
its
pedestal
behind
the
lamp
before
i
had
entirely
recovered
myself
the
notables
were
departing
to
catch
the
last
train
i
was
left
alone
with
callan
he
did
not
trouble
to
resume
his
attitude
for
me
and
when
he
did
speak
spoke
faster
interesting
man
mr
jinks
he
said
you
recognised
him
no
i
said
i
do
think
i
ever
met
him
callan
looked
annoyed
i
thought
i
got
him
pretty
well
he
hector
steele
in
my
he
added
indeed
i
said
i
had
never
been
able
to
read
blanfield
indeed
ah
yes
of
course
there
was
an
awkward
pause
the
whiskey
will
be
here
in
a
minute
he
said
suddenly
i
do
have
it
in
when
whatnot
here
he
the
rector
you
know
a
great
temperance
man
when
we
had
a
a
modest
quencher
we
get
to
business
oh
i
said
your
letters
really
meant
of
course
he
answered
oh
here
the
whiskey
well
now
fox
was
down
here
the
other
night
you
know
fox
of
course
did
he
start
the
rag
called
yes
yes
callan
answered
hastily
he
been
very
successful
in
launching
papers
now
he
trying
his
hand
with
a
new
one
he
any
amount
of
backers
big
names
you
know
he
to
run
my
next
as
a
this
this
venture
is
to
be
rather
more
serious
in
tone
than
any
that
he
done
hitherto
you
understand
why
yes
i
said
but
i
do
see
where
i
come
in
callan
took
a
meditative
sip
of
whiskey
added
a
little
more
water
a
little
more
whiskey
and
then
found
the
mixture
to
his
liking
you
see
he
said
fox
got
a
letter
here
to
say
that
wilkinson
had
died
suddenly
some
affection
of
the
heart
wilkinson
was
to
have
written
a
series
of
personal
articles
on
prominent
people
well
fox
was
nonplussed
and
i
put
in
a
word
for
you
i
sure
i
much
i
began
not
at
all
not
at
all
callan
interrupted
blandly
i
known
you
and
you
known
me
for
a
number
of
years
a
sudden
picture
danced
before
my
eyes
the
portrait
of
the
callan
of
the
old
days
the
fawning
shady
individual
with
the
seedy
clothes
the
furtive
eyes
and
the
obliging
manners
why
yes
i
said
but
i
do
see
that
that
gives
me
any
claim
callan
cleared
his
throat
the
lapse
of
time
he
said
in
his
grand
manner
rivets
what
we
may
call
the
bands
of
association
he
paused
to
inscribe
this
sentence
on
the
tablets
of
his
memory
it
would
be
dragged
in
to
form
a
purple
patch
in
his
new
serial
you
see
he
went
on
i
written
a
good
deal
of
autobiographical
matter
and
it
would
verge
upon
to
do
more
you
know
how
much
i
dislike
so
i
showed
fox
your
sketch
in
the
the
jenkins
story
i
said
how
did
you
come
to
see
it
then
send
me
the
he
answered
there
was
a
touch
of
sourness
in
his
tone
and
i
remembered
that
the
i
had
seen
had
been
ballasted
with
seven
goodly
pages
by
callan
himself
seven
unreadable
packed
pages
of
a
serial
as
i
was
saying
callan
began
again
you
ought
to
know
me
very
well
and
i
suppose
you
are
acquainted
with
my
books
as
for
the
rest
i
will
give
you
what
material
you
want
but
my
dear
callan
i
said
i
never
tried
my
hand
at
that
sort
of
thing
callan
silenced
me
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
it
struck
both
fox
and
myself
that
your
your
was
just
what
was
wanted
he
said
of
course
that
was
a
study
of
a
kind
of
painter
but
it
was
well
done
i
bowed
my
head
praise
from
callan
was
best
acknowledged
in
silence
you
see
what
we
want
or
rather
what
fox
wants
he
explained
is
a
kind
of
series
of
studies
of
celebrities
of
course
they
are
not
broken
down
but
if
you
can
treat
them
as
you
treated
jenkins
get
them
in
their
studies
surrounded
by
what
in
their
case
stands
for
the
broken
lay
figures
and
the
faded
serge
curtains
it
will
be
exactly
the
thing
it
will
be
a
new
line
or
rather
what
is
a
great
deal
better
mind
you
an
old
line
treated
in
a
slightly
very
slightly
different
way
that
what
the
public
wants
ah
yes
i
said
that
what
the
public
wants
but
all
the
same
been
done
time
out
of
mind
before
why
i
seen
photographs
of
you
and
your
and
your
and
so
on
half
a
score
of
times
in
the
sixpenny
magazines
callan
again
indicated
bland
superiority
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
you
undervalue
yourself
he
said
i
murmured
thanks
this
is
to
be
not
a
mere
pandering
to
curiosity
but
an
attempt
to
get
at
the
inside
of
things
to
get
the
atmosphere
so
to
speak
not
merely
to
catalogue
furniture
he
was
quoting
from
the
prospectus
of
the
new
paper
and
then
cleared
his
throat
for
the
utterance
of
a
tremendous
truth
photography
is
not
art
he
remarked
the
fantastic
side
of
our
colloquy
began
to
strike
me
after
all
i
thought
to
myself
why
should
that
girl
have
played
at
being
a
denizen
of
another
sphere
she
did
it
ever
so
much
better
than
callan
she
did
it
too
well
i
suppose
the
price
is
very
decent
callan
chimed
in
i
do
know
how
much
per
thousand
but
i
found
myself
reckoning
against
my
will
as
it
were
you
do
it
i
suppose
he
said
i
thought
of
my
debts
why
yes
i
suppose
so
i
answered
but
who
are
the
others
that
i
am
to
provide
with
atmospheres
callan
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
all
sorts
of
prominent
people
soldiers
statesmen
churchill
the
foreign
minister
artists
preachers
all
sorts
of
people
all
sorts
of
glory
occurred
to
me
the
paper
will
stand
expenses
up
to
a
reasonable
figure
callan
reassured
me
it
be
a
good
joke
for
a
time
i
said
i
infinitely
obliged
to
you
he
warded
off
my
thanks
with
both
hands
i
just
send
a
wire
to
fox
to
say
that
you
accept
he
said
rising
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
in
the
appropriate
attitude
he
had
an
appropriate
attitude
for
every
vicissitude
of
his
life
these
he
had
struck
before
so
many
people
that
even
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
he
was
ready
for
the
kodak
wielder
beside
him
he
had
every
form
of
every
kind
of
literary
there
were
that
swung
into
positions
suitable
to
appropriate
attitudes
there
were
piles
of
little
green
boxes
with
red
capital
letters
of
the
alphabet
upon
them
and
big
red
boxes
with
black
small
letters
there
was
a
that
cast
an
æsthetic
glow
upon
another
appropriate
attitude
and
there
was
one
typewriter
with
upon
it
and
another
with
paper
already
in
position
my
god
i
thought
to
these
heights
the
muse
soars
as
i
looked
at
the
gleaming
pillars
of
the
typewriters
the
image
of
my
own
desk
appeared
to
me
chipped
gloriously
dusty
i
thought
that
when
again
i
lit
my
battered
old
tin
lamp
i
should
see
ashes
and
a
an
old
gnawed
penny
penholder
bits
of
pink
old
letters
and
dust
everywhere
and
i
knew
that
my
attitude
when
i
sat
at
it
would
be
inappropriate
callan
was
ticking
off
the
telegram
upon
his
machine
it
will
go
in
the
morning
at
eight
he
said
chapter
three
to
encourage
me
i
suppose
callan
gave
me
the
of
his
next
to
read
in
bed
the
thing
was
so
bad
that
it
nearly
sickened
me
of
him
and
his
jobs
i
tried
to
read
the
stuff
to
read
it
conscientiously
to
read
myself
to
sleep
with
it
i
was
under
obligations
to
old
cal
and
i
wanted
to
do
him
justice
but
the
thing
was
impossible
i
fathomed
a
sort
of
a
plot
it
dealt
in
fratricide
with
a
touch
of
adultery
a
great
moral
purpose
loomed
in
the
background
it
would
have
been
a
dully
readable
novel
but
for
that
as
it
was
it
was
intolerable
it
was
amazing
that
cal
himself
could
put
out
such
stuff
that
he
should
have
the
impudence
he
was
not
a
fool
not
by
any
means
a
fool
it
revolted
me
more
than
a
little
i
came
to
it
out
of
a
different
plane
of
thought
i
may
not
have
been
able
to
write
then
or
i
may
but
i
did
know
enough
to
recognise
the
flagrantly
the
indecently
bad
and
upon
my
soul
the
idea
that
i
too
must
cynically
offer
this
sort
of
stuff
if
i
was
ever
to
sell
my
tens
of
thousands
very
nearly
sent
me
back
to
my
solitude
callan
had
begun
very
much
as
i
was
beginning
now
he
had
even
i
believe
had
ideals
in
his
youth
and
had
starved
a
little
it
was
rather
trying
to
think
that
perhaps
i
was
really
no
more
than
another
callan
that
when
at
last
i
came
to
review
my
life
i
should
have
much
such
a
record
to
look
back
upon
it
disgusted
me
a
little
and
when
i
put
out
the
light
the
horrors
settled
down
upon
me
i
woke
in
a
shivering
frame
of
mind
ashamed
to
meet
callan
eye
it
was
as
if
he
must
be
aware
of
my
thoughts
as
if
he
must
think
me
a
fool
who
quarrelled
with
my
victuals
he
gave
no
signs
of
any
such
knowledge
was
dignified
cordial
discussed
his
breakfast
with
gusto
opened
his
letters
and
so
on
an
anæmic
amanuensis
was
taking
notes
for
appropriate
replies
how
could
i
tell
him
that
i
would
not
do
the
work
that
i
was
too
proud
and
all
the
rest
of
it
he
would
have
thought
me
a
fool
would
have
stiffened
into
hostility
i
should
have
lost
my
last
chance
and
in
the
broad
light
of
day
i
was
loath
to
do
that
he
began
to
talk
about
indifferent
things
we
glided
out
on
to
a
current
of
mediocre
conversation
the
psychical
moment
if
there
were
any
such
disappeared
someone
bearing
my
name
had
written
to
express
an
intention
of
offering
personal
worship
that
afternoon
the
prospect
seemed
to
please
the
great
cal
he
was
used
to
such
things
he
found
them
pay
i
suppose
we
began
desultorily
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
the
writer
being
a
relation
of
mine
i
doubted
i
had
no
relations
that
i
knew
of
there
was
a
phenomenal
old
aunt
who
had
inherited
the
acres
and
respectability
of
the
etchingham
grangers
but
she
was
not
the
kind
of
person
to
worship
a
novelist
i
the
poor
last
of
the
family
was
without
the
pale
simply
because
i
too
was
a
novelist
i
explained
these
things
to
callan
and
he
commented
on
them
found
it
strange
how
small
or
how
large
i
forget
which
the
world
was
since
his
own
apotheosis
shoals
of
callans
had
claimed
relationship
i
ate
my
breakfast
afterward
we
set
about
the
hatching
of
that
article
the
thought
of
it
sickens
me
even
now
you
will
find
it
in
the
volume
along
with
the
others
you
may
see
how
i
lugged
in
surroundings
his
his
the
romantic
arbour
in
which
he
found
it
easy
to
write
the
clipped
trees
like
peacocks
and
the
trees
clipped
like
bears
and
all
the
rest
of
the
background
for
appropriate
attitudes
he
was
satisfied
with
any
arrangements
of
words
that
suggested
a
gentle
awe
on
the
part
of
the
writer
yes
yes
he
said
once
or
twice
that
just
the
touch
just
the
touch
very
nice
but
do
you
think
we
lunched
after
some
time
i
was
so
happy
quite
pathetically
happy
it
had
come
so
easy
to
me
i
had
doubted
my
ability
to
do
the
sort
of
thing
but
it
had
written
itself
as
money
spends
itself
and
i
was
going
to
earn
money
like
that
the
whole
of
my
past
seemed
a
mistake
a
childishness
i
had
kept
out
of
this
sort
of
thing
because
i
had
thought
it
below
me
i
had
kept
out
of
it
and
had
starved
my
body
and
warped
my
mind
perhaps
i
had
even
damaged
my
work
by
this
isolation
to
understand
life
one
must
live
and
i
had
only
brooded
but
by
jove
i
would
try
to
live
now
callan
had
retired
for
his
accustomed
siesta
and
i
was
smoking
pipe
after
pipe
over
a
confoundedly
bad
french
novel
that
i
had
found
in
the
i
must
have
been
dozing
a
voice
from
behind
my
back
announced
miss
etchingham
granger
and
added
callan
will
be
down
directly
i
laid
down
my
pipe
wondered
whether
i
ought
to
have
been
smoking
when
cal
expected
visitors
and
rose
to
my
feet
you
i
said
sharply
she
answered
you
see
she
was
smiling
she
had
been
so
much
in
my
thoughts
that
i
was
hardly
surprised
the
thing
had
even
an
air
of
pleasant
inevitability
about
it
you
must
be
a
cousin
of
mine
i
said
the
name
oh
call
it
sister
she
answered
i
was
feeling
inclined
for
farce
if
blessed
chance
would
throw
it
in
my
way
you
see
i
was
going
to
live
at
last
and
life
for
me
meant
irresponsibility
ah
i
said
ironically
you
are
going
to
be
a
sister
to
me
as
they
say
she
might
have
come
the
bogy
over
me
last
night
in
the
moonlight
but
now
there
was
a
spice
of
danger
about
it
too
just
a
touch
lurking
somewhere
besides
she
was
and
well
set
up
and
i
could
see
what
could
touch
me
even
if
it
did
even
if
i
got
into
a
mess
i
had
no
relatives
not
even
a
friend
to
be
worried
about
me
i
stood
quite
alone
and
i
half
relished
the
idea
of
getting
into
a
mess
it
would
be
part
of
life
too
i
was
going
to
have
a
little
money
and
she
excited
my
curiosity
i
was
tingling
to
know
what
she
was
really
at
and
one
might
ask
i
said
what
you
are
doing
in
this
in
this
i
was
at
a
loss
for
a
word
to
describe
the
room
the
smugness
parading
as
professional
bohemianism
oh
i
am
about
my
own
business
she
said
i
told
you
last
night
have
you
forgotten
last
night
you
were
to
inherit
the
earth
i
reminded
her
and
one
does
start
in
a
place
like
this
now
i
should
have
gone
well
i
should
have
gone
to
some
politician
house
a
cabinet
minister
say
to
gurnard
he
the
coming
man
is
he
why
yes
she
answered
he
the
coming
man
you
will
remember
that
in
those
days
gurnard
was
only
the
dark
horse
of
the
ministry
i
knew
little
enough
of
these
things
despised
politics
generally
they
simply
did
interest
me
gurnard
i
disliked
platonically
perhaps
because
his
face
was
a
little
enigmatic
a
little
repulsive
the
country
then
was
in
the
position
of
having
no
opposition
and
a
cabinet
with
two
distinct
strains
in
it
the
churchill
and
the
gurnard
and
gurnard
was
the
dark
horse
oh
you
should
join
your
flats
i
said
pleasantly
if
he
the
coming
man
where
do
you
come
in
unless
he
too
is
a
dimensionist
oh
both
both
she
answered
i
admired
the
tranquillity
with
which
she
converted
my
points
into
her
own
and
i
was
very
happy
it
struck
me
as
a
pleasant
sort
of
fooling
i
suppose
you
will
let
me
know
some
day
who
you
are
i
said
i
have
told
you
several
times
she
answered
oh
you
wo
frighten
me
i
asserted
not
here
you
know
and
anyhow
why
should
you
want
to
i
have
told
you
she
said
again
you
told
me
you
were
my
sister
i
said
but
my
sister
died
years
and
years
ago
still
if
it
suits
you
if
you
want
to
be
sister
it
suits
me
she
answered
i
want
to
be
placed
you
see
i
knew
that
my
name
was
good
enough
to
place
anyone
we
had
been
the
grangers
of
etchingham
since
oh
since
the
flood
and
if
the
girl
wanted
to
be
my
sister
and
a
granger
why
the
devil
should
she
so
long
as
she
would
let
me
continue
on
this
footing
i
had
talked
to
a
woman
not
to
a
well
one
for
ages
and
ages
it
was
as
if
i
had
come
back
from
one
of
the
places
to
which
younger
sons
exile
themselves
and
for
all
i
knew
it
might
be
the
correct
thing
for
girls
to
elect
brothers
nowadays
in
one
set
or
another
oh
tell
me
some
more
i
said
one
likes
to
know
about
one
sister
you
and
the
right
honourable
charles
gurnard
are
dimensionists
and
who
are
the
others
of
your
set
there
is
only
one
she
answered
and
would
you
believe
it
it
seems
he
was
fox
the
editor
of
my
new
paper
you
select
your
characters
with
charming
indiscriminateness
i
said
fox
is
only
a
sort
of
toad
you
know
he
wo
get
far
oh
he
go
far
she
answered
but
he
wo
get
there
fox
is
fighting
against
us
oh
so
you
do
dwell
in
amity
i
said
you
fight
for
your
own
hands
we
fight
for
our
own
hands
she
answered
i
shall
throw
gurnard
over
when
he
pulled
the
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
i
was
beginning
to
get
a
little
tired
of
this
you
see
for
me
the
scene
was
a
veiled
flirtation
and
i
wanted
to
get
on
but
i
had
to
listen
to
her
fantastic
scheme
of
things
it
was
really
a
duel
between
fox
the
and
gurnard
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
fox
with
churchill
the
foreign
minister
and
his
supporters
for
pieces
played
what
he
called
the
old
morality
business
against
gurnard
who
passed
for
a
cynically
immoral
politician
i
grew
more
impatient
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
this
stage
into
something
more
personal
i
thought
she
invented
this
sort
of
stuff
to
keep
me
from
getting
at
her
errand
at
callan
but
i
did
want
to
know
her
errand
i
wanted
to
make
love
to
her
as
for
fox
and
gurnard
and
churchill
the
foreign
minister
who
really
was
a
sympathetic
character
and
did
stand
for
political
probity
she
might
be
uttering
allegorical
truths
but
i
was
not
interested
in
them
i
wanted
to
start
some
topic
that
would
lead
away
from
this
dimensionist
farce
my
dear
sister
i
began
callan
always
moved
about
like
a
confounded
eavesdropper
wore
carpet
slippers
and
stepped
round
the
corners
of
screens
i
expect
he
got
copy
like
that
so
she
your
sister
he
said
suddenly
from
behind
me
strange
that
you
should
recognise
the
handwriting
oh
we
do
correspond
i
said
we
are
different
i
wanted
to
take
a
rise
out
of
the
creeping
animal
that
he
was
he
confronted
her
blandly
you
must
be
the
little
girl
that
i
remember
he
said
he
had
known
my
parents
ages
ago
that
indeed
was
how
i
came
to
know
him
i
have
chosen
him
for
a
friend
i
thought
granger
said
you
were
dead
but
one
gets
confused
oh
we
see
very
little
of
each
other
she
answered
arthur
might
have
said
i
was
dead
he
capable
of
anything
you
know
she
spoke
with
an
assumption
of
sisterly
indifference
that
was
absolutely
striking
i
began
to
think
she
must
be
an
actress
of
genius
she
did
it
so
well
she
the
sister
who
had
remained
within
the
pale
i
the
rapscallion
of
a
brother
whose
vagaries
were
trying
to
his
relations
that
was
the
note
she
struck
and
she
maintained
it
i
did
know
what
the
deuce
she
was
driving
at
and
i
did
care
these
scenes
with
a
touch
of
madness
appealed
to
me
i
was
going
to
live
and
here
apparently
was
a
woman
ready
to
my
hand
besides
she
was
making
a
fool
of
callan
and
that
pleased
me
his
patronising
manners
had
irritated
me
i
assisted
rather
silently
they
began
to
talk
of
mutual
acquaintances
as
one
talks
they
both
seemed
to
know
everyone
in
this
world
she
gave
herself
the
airs
of
being
quite
in
the
inner
ring
alleged
familiarity
with
quite
impossible
persons
with
my
portentous
aunt
with
cabinet
ministers
that
sort
of
people
they
talked
about
them
she
as
if
she
lived
among
them
he
as
if
he
tried
very
hard
to
live
up
to
them
she
affected
reverence
for
his
person
plied
him
with
compliments
that
he
swallowed
raw
horribly
raw
it
made
me
shudder
a
little
it
was
tragic
to
see
the
little
great
man
confronted
with
that
woman
it
shocked
me
to
think
that
really
i
must
appear
much
like
him
must
have
looked
like
that
yesterday
he
was
a
little
uneasy
i
thought
made
little
confidences
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
little
confidences
about
the
the
new
paper
for
which
i
was
engaged
it
seemed
to
be
run
by
a
small
gang
with
quite
a
number
of
assorted
axes
to
grind
there
was
some
foreign
financier
a
person
of
position
whom
she
knew
a
noble
man
in
the
sense
callan
said
there
was
some
politician
she
knew
him
too
and
he
was
equally
excellent
so
callan
said
churchill
himself
an
artist
or
so
an
actor
or
so
and
callan
they
all
wanted
a
little
backing
so
it
seemed
callan
of
course
put
it
in
another
way
the
great
moral
purpose
turned
up
i
do
know
why
he
could
not
think
he
was
taking
me
in
and
she
obviously
knew
more
about
the
people
concerned
than
he
did
but
there
it
was
looming
large
and
quite
as
farcical
as
all
the
rest
of
it
the
foreign
financier
they
called
him
the
duc
de
mersch
was
by
way
of
being
a
philanthropist
on
megalomaniac
lines
for
some
international
reason
he
had
been
allowed
to
possess
himself
of
the
pleasant
land
of
greenland
there
was
gold
in
it
and
in
it
and
other
things
that
paid
but
the
duc
de
mersch
was
not
thinking
of
that
he
was
first
and
foremost
a
state
founder
or
at
least
he
was
that
after
being
titular
ruler
of
some
little
spot
of
a
teutonic
no
one
of
the
great
powers
would
let
any
other
of
the
great
powers
possess
the
country
so
it
had
been
handed
over
to
the
duc
de
mersch
who
had
at
heart
said
cal
the
glorious
vision
of
founding
a
model
state
model
state
in
which
washed
and
broadclothed
esquimaux
would
live
side
by
side
regenerated
lives
enfranchised
equals
of
choicely
selected
younger
sons
of
whatever
occidental
race
it
was
that
sort
of
thing
i
was
even
a
little
overpowered
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
callan
was
its
trumpeter
there
was
something
fine
about
the
conception
and
churchill
acquiescence
seemed
to
guarantee
an
honesty
in
its
execution
the
duc
de
mersch
wanted
money
and
he
wanted
to
run
a
railway
across
greenland
his
idea
was
that
the
british
public
should
supply
the
money
and
the
british
government
back
the
railway
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
a
less
philanthropic
suez
canal
in
return
he
offered
an
eligible
harbour
and
a
strip
of
coast
at
one
end
of
the
line
the
british
public
was
to
be
repaid
in
casks
of
and
gold
and
with
the
consciousness
of
having
aided
in
letting
the
light
in
upon
a
dark
spot
of
the
earth
so
the
duc
de
mersch
started
the
the
was
to
extol
the
duc
de
mersch
moral
purpose
to
pat
the
government
back
influence
public
opinion
and
generally
advance
the
cause
of
the
system
for
the
regeneration
of
the
arctic
regions
i
tell
the
story
rather
flippantly
because
i
heard
it
from
callan
and
because
it
was
impossible
to
take
him
seriously
besides
i
was
not
very
much
interested
in
the
thing
itself
but
it
did
interest
me
to
see
how
deftly
she
pumped
him
squeezed
him
dry
i
was
even
a
little
alarmed
for
poor
old
cal
after
all
the
man
had
done
me
a
service
had
got
me
a
job
as
for
her
she
struck
me
as
a
potentially
dangerous
person
one
could
tell
she
might
be
some
adventuress
or
if
not
that
a
speculator
who
would
damage
cal
little
schemes
i
put
it
to
her
plainly
afterward
and
quarrelled
with
her
as
well
as
i
could
i
drove
her
down
to
the
station
callan
must
have
been
distinctly
impressed
or
he
would
never
have
had
out
his
trap
for
her
you
know
i
said
to
her
i
wo
have
you
play
tricks
with
callan
not
while
you
using
my
name
it
very
much
at
your
service
as
far
as
i
concerned
but
confound
it
if
you
going
to
injure
him
i
shall
have
to
show
you
up
to
tell
him
you
could
you
know
she
said
perfectly
calmly
you
let
yourself
in
for
it
he
would
feel
pleased
with
you
for
letting
it
go
as
far
as
it
has
you
lose
your
job
and
you
going
to
live
you
know
you
going
to
live
i
was
taken
aback
by
this
veiled
threat
in
the
midst
of
the
pleasantry
it
was
fair
play
not
at
all
fair
play
i
recovered
some
of
my
old
alarm
remembered
that
she
really
was
a
dangerous
person
that
but
i
hurt
callan
she
said
suddenly
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
you
really
wo
i
asked
really
not
she
answered
it
relieved
me
to
believe
her
i
did
not
want
to
quarrel
with
her
you
see
she
fascinated
me
she
seemed
to
act
as
a
stimulant
to
set
me
tingling
somehow
and
to
baffle
me
and
there
was
truth
in
what
she
said
i
had
let
myself
in
for
it
and
i
did
want
to
lose
callan
job
by
telling
him
i
had
made
a
fool
of
him
i
do
care
about
anything
else
i
said
she
smiled
chapter
four
i
went
up
to
town
bearing
the
callan
article
and
a
letter
of
warm
commendation
from
callan
to
fox
i
had
been
very
docile
had
accepted
emendations
had
lavished
praise
had
been
unctuous
and
yet
had
contrived
to
retain
the
dignified
savour
of
the
editorial
we
callan
himself
asked
no
more
i
was
directed
to
seek
fox
out
to
find
him
immediately
the
matter
was
growing
urgent
fox
was
not
at
the
office
the
brand
new
office
that
i
afterward
saw
pass
through
the
succeeding
stages
of
comfort
and
dusty
neglect
i
was
directed
to
ask
for
him
at
the
stage
door
of
the
buckingham
i
waited
in
the
doorkeeper
glass
box
at
the
buckingham
i
was
eyed
by
the
suspicious
commissionaire
with
the
contempt
reserved
for
resting
actors
resting
actors
are
hungry
suppliants
as
a
rule
sought
fox
anybody
seen
fox
he
gone
to
lunch
fox
is
out
said
the
commissionaire
i
explained
that
the
matter
was
urgent
more
disappeared
through
the
folding
doors
unenticing
personages
passed
the
glass
box
casting
hostile
glances
askance
at
me
on
my
high
stool
a
message
came
back
if
it
etchingham
granger
he
to
follow
fox
to
at
once
i
followed
fox
to
hartly
to
a
little
flat
in
a
neighbourhood
that
i
need
not
specify
the
eminent
journalist
was
lunching
with
the
eminent
actress
a
husband
was
in
attendance
a
nonentity
with
a
heavy
yellow
moustache
who
hummed
and
hawed
over
his
watch
fox
was
with
a
persuasive
peremptory
manner
hartly
was
well
she
was
just
hartly
you
remember
how
we
all
fell
in
love
with
her
figure
and
her
manner
and
her
voice
and
the
way
she
used
her
hands
she
broke
her
bread
with
those
very
hands
spoke
to
her
husband
with
that
very
voice
and
rose
from
table
with
that
same
graceful
management
of
her
limp
skirts
she
made
eyes
at
me
at
her
husband
at
little
fox
at
the
man
who
handed
the
asparagus
great
round
grey
eyes
she
was
just
the
same
the
curtain
never
fell
on
that
eternal
dress
rehearsal
i
do
wonder
the
husband
was
forever
looking
at
his
watch
fox
was
a
friend
of
the
house
he
dispensed
with
ceremony
read
my
manuscript
over
his
roquefort
and
seemed
to
find
it
add
to
the
savour
you
are
going
to
do
me
for
fox
hartly
said
turning
her
large
grey
eyes
upon
me
they
were
very
soft
they
seemed
to
send
out
waves
of
intense
sympatheticism
i
thought
of
those
others
that
had
shot
out
a
ray
why
i
answered
there
was
some
talk
of
my
doing
somebody
for
the
fox
put
my
manuscript
under
his
empty
tumbler
yes
he
said
sharply
he
will
do
i
think
h
yes
why
yes
you
a
friend
of
callan
are
you
hartly
asked
what
a
dear
nice
man
he
is
you
should
see
him
at
rehearsals
you
know
doing
his
he
given
me
a
perfectly
lovely
part
perfectly
lovely
and
the
trouble
he
takes
he
tries
every
chair
on
the
stage
h
yes
fox
interjected
he
likes
to
have
his
own
way
we
like
that
the
great
actress
said
she
was
quoting
from
her
first
great
part
i
thought
but
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
that
all
her
utterances
were
quotations
from
her
first
great
part
her
husband
looked
at
his
watch
are
you
coming
to
this
confounded
flower
show
he
asked
yes
she
said
turning
her
mysterious
eyes
upon
him
i
go
and
get
ready
she
disappeared
through
an
inner
door
i
expected
to
hear
the
and
the
heavy
fall
from
the
next
room
i
forgot
that
it
was
not
the
end
of
the
fifth
act
fox
put
my
manuscript
into
his
breast
pocket
come
along
granger
he
said
to
me
i
want
to
speak
to
you
have
plenty
of
opportunity
for
seeing
hartly
i
expect
she
tenth
on
your
list
hartly
hartly
hand
was
wavering
between
his
moustache
and
his
watch
pocket
he
said
sulkily
you
must
come
and
see
me
again
granger
hartly
said
from
the
door
come
to
the
buckingham
and
see
how
we
getting
on
with
your
friend
play
we
must
have
a
good
long
talk
if
you
to
get
my
local
colour
as
fox
calls
it
to
gild
refined
gold
to
paint
the
lily
to
throw
a
perfume
on
the
violet
i
quoted
banally
that
it
she
said
with
a
tender
smile
she
was
fastening
a
button
in
her
glove
i
doubt
her
recognition
of
the
quotation
when
we
were
in
our
hansom
fox
began
i
relieved
by
what
i
seen
of
your
copy
one
did
expect
this
sort
of
thing
from
you
you
think
it
a
bit
below
you
do
you
oh
i
know
i
know
you
literary
people
are
usually
so
impracticable
you
know
what
i
mean
callan
said
you
were
the
man
callan
has
his
uses
but
one
has
something
else
to
do
with
one
paper
i
got
interests
of
my
own
but
you
do
it
all
you
do
mind
my
being
candid
do
you
now
i
muttered
that
i
rather
liked
it
well
then
he
went
on
now
i
see
my
way
i
glad
you
do
i
murmured
i
wish
i
did
oh
that
will
be
all
right
fox
comforted
i
dare
say
callan
has
rather
sickened
you
of
the
job
particularly
if
you
ai
used
to
it
but
you
wo
find
the
others
as
trying
there
churchill
now
your
next
you
have
to
mind
him
you
find
him
a
decent
chap
not
a
bit
of
side
on
him
what
churchill
i
asked
the
foreign
minister
the
devil
i
said
oh
you
find
him
all
right
fox
reassured
you
to
go
down
to
his
place
it
all
arranged
here
we
are
hop
out
he
suited
his
own
action
to
his
words
and
ran
nimbly
up
the
new
steps
of
the
home
he
left
me
to
pay
the
cabman
when
i
rejoined
him
he
was
giving
directions
to
an
invisible
somebody
through
folding
doors
come
along
he
said
breathlessly
ca
see
him
he
added
to
a
little
boy
who
held
a
card
in
his
hands
tell
him
to
go
to
evans
one
life
is
one
own
here
he
went
on
when
he
had
reached
his
own
room
it
was
a
palatial
apartment
furnished
in
white
and
gold
louis
quinze
or
something
of
the
sort
with
very
new
decorations
after
watteau
covering
the
walls
the
process
of
disfiguration
however
had
already
begun
a
roll
desk
of
the
least
possible
louis
quinze
order
stood
in
one
of
the
tall
windows
the
carpet
was
marked
by
muddy
footprints
and
a
matchboard
screen
had
been
run
across
one
end
of
the
room
hullo
evans
fox
shouted
across
it
just
see
that
man
from
grant
will
you
heard
from
the
central
news
yet
he
was
looking
through
the
papers
on
the
desk
not
yet
i
just
rung
them
up
for
the
fifth
time
the
answer
came
keep
on
at
it
fox
exhorted
here
churchill
letter
he
said
to
me
have
an
those
blasted
things
are
too
uncomfortable
for
anything
make
yourself
comfortable
i
be
back
in
a
minute
i
took
an
and
addressed
myself
to
the
foreign
letter
it
expressed
bored
tolerance
of
a
potential
interviewer
but
it
seemed
to
please
fox
he
ran
into
the
room
snatched
up
a
paper
from
his
desk
and
ran
out
again
read
churchill
letter
he
asked
in
passing
i
tell
you
all
about
it
in
a
minute
i
do
know
what
he
expected
me
to
do
with
it
kiss
the
postage
stamp
perhaps
at
the
same
time
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
there
idle
in
the
midst
of
the
hurry
the
breathlessness
i
seemed
to
be
at
last
in
contact
with
real
life
with
the
life
that
matters
i
was
somebody
too
fox
treated
me
with
a
kind
of
deference
as
if
i
were
a
great
unknown
his
you
literary
men
was
pleasing
it
was
the
homage
that
the
pretender
pays
to
the
legitimate
prince
the
recognition
due
to
the
real
thing
from
the
imitation
the
homage
of
the
builder
to
the
architect
ah
yes
it
seemed
to
say
we
jobbing
men
run
up
our
rows
and
rows
of
houses
build
whole
towns
and
fill
the
papers
for
years
but
when
we
want
something
special
something
monumental
we
have
to
come
to
you
fox
came
in
again
very
sorry
my
dear
fellow
find
i
ca
possibly
get
a
moment
for
a
chat
with
you
look
here
come
and
dine
with
me
at
the
paragraph
round
the
corner
at
six
sharp
you
go
to
churchill
the
paragraph
club
where
i
was
to
meet
fox
was
one
of
those
sporadic
establishments
that
spring
up
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
strand
it
is
one
of
their
qualities
that
they
are
always
just
round
the
corner
another
that
their
stewards
are
too
familiar
another
that
they
in
the
opinion
of
the
other
members
are
run
too
much
for
the
convenience
of
one
in
particular
in
this
case
it
was
fox
who
kept
the
dinner
waiting
i
sat
in
the
little
and
from
behind
a
belated
morning
paper
listened
to
the
conversation
of
the
three
or
four
journalists
who
represented
the
members
i
felt
as
a
new
boy
in
a
new
school
feels
on
his
first
introduction
to
his
fellows
there
was
a
fossil
dramatic
critic
sleeping
in
an
before
the
fire
at
he
woke
up
remarked
you
should
have
seen
fanny
ellsler
and
went
to
sleep
again
sprawling
on
a
red
velvet
couch
was
a
jeune
with
the
necktie
of
a
student
on
a
chair
beside
him
sat
a
personage
whom
perhaps
because
of
his
plentiful
lack
of
h
i
took
for
a
distinguished
foreigner
they
were
talking
about
a
splendid
subject
for
a
dramatic
sketch
of
some
sort
afforded
by
a
bus
driver
i
fancy
i
heard
afterward
that
my
frenchman
had
been
a
costermonger
and
was
now
half
journalist
half
financier
and
that
my
art
student
was
an
employee
of
one
of
the
older
magazines
dinner
on
the
table
gents
the
steward
said
from
the
door
he
went
toward
the
sleeper
by
the
fire
i
expect
cunningham
will
wear
that
out
before
he
done
he
said
over
his
shoulder
poor
old
chap
he
got
nowhere
else
to
go
to
the
magazine
employee
said
why
does
he
go
to
the
the
journalist
financier
retorted
make
a
good
sketch
that
eh
he
continued
reverting
to
his
jolly
the
magazine
employee
said
indifferently
now
then
cunningham
the
steward
said
touching
the
sleeper
on
the
shoulder
dinner
on
the
table
god
bless
my
soul
the
dramatic
critic
said
with
a
start
the
steward
left
the
room
the
dramatic
critic
furtively
took
a
set
of
false
teeth
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
wiped
them
with
a
bandanna
handkerchief
and
inserted
them
in
his
mouth
he
tottered
out
of
the
room
i
got
up
and
began
to
inspect
the
sketches
on
the
walls
the
faded
paltry
caricatures
of
faded
paltry
lesser
lights
that
confronted
me
from
frames
on
the
purple
walls
almost
made
me
shiver
there
you
are
granger
said
a
cheerful
voice
behind
me
come
and
have
some
dinner
i
went
and
had
some
dinner
it
was
seasoned
by
small
jokes
and
little
personalities
a
teutonic
journalist
a
musical
critic
i
suppose
inquired
as
to
the
origin
of
the
meagre
pheasant
fox
replied
that
it
had
been
preserved
in
the
the
dramatic
critic
mumbled
unheard
that
some
piece
or
other
was
off
the
bills
of
the
adelphi
i
grinned
vacantly
afterward
under
his
breath
fox
put
me
up
to
a
thing
or
two
regarding
the
inner
meaning
of
the
new
daily
put
by
him
without
any
glamour
of
a
moral
purpose
the
case
seemed
rather
mean
the
dingy
depressed
me
and
the
whole
thing
was
what
i
had
for
so
many
years
striven
to
keep
out
of
fox
hung
over
my
ear
whispering
there
were
shades
of
intonation
in
his
sibillating
some
of
those
in
it
the
voice
implied
were
not
others
were
and
the
tone
became
deferential
implied
that
i
was
to
take
my
tone
from
itself
of
course
a
man
like
the
right
honourable
does
it
on
the
straight
quite
on
the
straight
has
to
have
some
sort
of
backer
in
this
case
it
me
the
they
a
bit
splitty
the
ministry
i
mean
they
say
gurnard
is
playing
square
they
so
his
broad
red
face
glowed
as
he
bent
down
to
my
ear
his
little
eyes
twinkled
with
moisture
he
enlightened
me
cautiously
circumspectly
there
was
something
unpleasant
in
the
business
not
exactly
in
fox
himself
but
the
kind
of
thing
i
wish
he
would
cease
his
explanations
i
did
want
to
hear
them
i
have
never
wanted
to
know
how
things
are
worked
preferring
to
take
the
world
at
its
face
value
callan
revelations
had
been
bearable
because
of
the
farcical
pompousness
of
his
manner
but
this
was
different
it
had
the
stamp
of
truth
perhaps
because
it
was
a
little
dirty
i
did
want
to
hear
that
the
foreign
minister
was
ever
so
remotely
mixed
up
in
this
business
he
was
only
a
symbol
to
me
but
he
stood
for
the
stability
of
statesmanship
and
for
the
decencies
that
it
is
troublesome
to
have
touched
of
course
he
was
proceeding
the
churchill
gang
would
like
to
go
on
playing
the
to
us
but
it
wo
do
they
got
to
come
in
or
see
themselves
left
gurnard
has
pretty
well
nobbled
their
old
party
press
so
they
got
to
begin
all
over
again
that
was
it
that
was
precisely
it
churchill
ought
to
have
played
the
to
people
like
us
to
have
gone
on
playing
it
at
whatever
cost
that
was
what
i
demanded
of
the
world
as
i
conceived
it
it
was
so
much
less
troublesome
in
that
way
on
the
other
hand
this
was
life
i
was
living
now
and
the
cost
of
living
is
disillusionment
it
was
the
price
i
had
to
pay
obviously
a
foreign
minister
had
to
have
a
organ
or
i
supposed
so
mind
you
fox
whispered
on
i
think
myself
that
it
a
pity
he
is
supporting
the
greenland
business
the
thing
not
straight
but
it
going
to
be
made
to
pay
like
hell
and
there
the
national
interest
to
be
considered
if
this
government
did
take
it
up
some
other
would
and
that
would
give
gurnard
and
a
lot
of
others
a
peg
against
churchill
and
his
we
ca
afford
to
lose
any
more
coaling
stations
in
greenland
or
anywhere
else
and
mind
you
can
look
after
the
interests
of
the
niggers
a
good
deal
better
if
he
a
hand
in
the
pie
you
see
the
position
eh
i
was
actually
listening
to
him
but
i
nodded
at
proper
intervals
i
knew
that
he
wanted
me
to
take
that
line
in
confidential
conversations
with
fellows
seeking
copy
i
was
quite
resigned
to
that
incidentally
i
was
overcome
by
the
conviction
perhaps
it
was
no
more
than
a
sensation
that
that
girl
was
mixed
up
in
this
thing
that
her
shadow
was
somewhere
among
the
others
flickering
upon
the
sheet
i
wanted
to
ask
fox
if
he
knew
her
but
then
in
that
absurd
business
i
did
not
even
know
her
name
and
the
whole
story
would
have
sounded
a
little
mad
just
now
it
suited
me
that
fox
should
have
a
moderate
idea
of
my
sanity
besides
the
thing
was
out
of
tone
i
idealised
her
then
one
would
talk
about
her
in
a
full
of
men
telling
stories
and
one
would
talk
about
her
at
all
to
fox
the
musical
critic
had
been
prowling
about
the
room
with
fox
eyes
upon
him
he
edged
suddenly
nearer
pushed
a
chair
aside
and
came
toward
us
hullo
he
said
in
an
ostentatiously
genial
voice
what
are
you
two
chaps
about
private
matters
fox
answered
without
moving
a
hair
then
i
suppose
i
in
the
way
the
other
muttered
fox
did
not
answer
wants
a
job
he
said
watching
the
discomfited
teuton
retreat
but
as
i
was
saying
oh
it
pays
both
ways
he
paused
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
he
had
been
explaining
the
financial
details
of
the
matter
in
which
the
duc
de
mersch
and
callan
and
hartly
and
all
these
people
clubbed
together
and
started
a
paper
which
they
hired
fox
to
run
which
was
to
bring
their
money
back
again
which
was
to
scratch
their
backs
which
it
was
like
the
house
that
jack
built
i
wondered
who
jack
was
that
was
it
who
was
jack
it
all
hinged
upon
that
why
yes
i
said
it
seems
rather
neat
of
course
fox
wandered
on
you
are
wondering
why
the
deuce
i
tell
you
all
this
fact
is
you
hear
it
all
if
i
did
and
a
good
deal
more
that
is
true
besides
but
i
believe
you
the
sort
of
chap
to
respect
a
confidence
i
did
rise
to
the
sentiment
i
knew
as
well
as
he
did
that
he
was
bamboozling
me
that
he
was
as
he
said
only
telling
me
not
the
truth
but
just
what
i
should
hear
everywhere
i
did
not
bear
him
any
it
was
part
of
the
game
that
but
the
question
was
who
was
jack
it
might
be
fox
himself
there
might
after
all
be
some
meaning
in
the
farrago
of
nonsense
that
that
fantastic
girl
had
let
off
upon
me
fox
really
and
in
a
figure
of
speech
such
as
she
allowed
herself
might
be
running
a
team
consisting
of
the
duc
de
mersch
and
churchill
chapter
four
he
might
really
be
backing
a
foreign
philanthropic
ruler
and
and
a
british
foreign
minister
against
the
rather
sinister
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
that
gurnard
undoubtedly
was
it
might
suit
him
perhaps
he
had
shares
in
something
or
other
that
depended
on
the
success
of
the
duc
de
mersch
greenland
protectorate
i
knew
well
enough
you
must
remember
that
fox
was
a
big
man
one
of
those
big
men
that
remain
permanently
behind
the
curtain
perhaps
because
they
have
a
certain
lack
of
comeliness
of
one
sort
or
another
and
do
look
well
on
the
stage
itself
and
i
understood
now
that
if
he
had
abandoned
as
he
had
done
half
a
dozen
enterprises
of
his
own
for
the
sake
of
the
it
must
be
because
it
was
very
well
worth
his
while
it
was
not
merely
a
question
of
the
editorship
of
a
paper
there
was
something
very
much
bigger
in
the
background
my
dimensionist
young
lady
again
might
have
other
shares
that
depended
on
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
blocking
the
way
in
that
way
she
might
very
well
talk
allegorically
of
herself
as
in
alliance
with
gurnard
against
fox
and
churchill
i
was
at
sea
in
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
understood
vaguely
that
something
of
the
sort
was
remotely
possible
i
did
feel
called
upon
to
back
out
of
it
on
that
account
yet
i
very
decidedly
wished
that
the
thing
could
have
been
otherwise
for
myself
i
came
into
the
matter
with
clean
hands
and
i
was
going
to
keep
my
hands
clean
otherwise
i
was
at
fox
disposal
i
understand
i
said
the
speech
marking
my
decision
i
shall
have
dealings
with
a
good
many
of
the
proprietors
i
am
the
scratcher
in
fact
and
you
do
want
me
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
well
he
answered
gauging
me
with
his
blue
gimlet
eyes
it
just
as
well
to
know
it
just
as
well
to
know
i
echoed
it
just
as
well
to
know
chapter
five
i
had
gone
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
night
with
a
firmer
step
with
a
new
assurance
i
had
had
my
interview
the
thing
was
definitely
settled
the
first
thing
in
my
life
that
had
ever
been
definitely
settled
and
i
felt
i
must
tell
lea
before
i
slept
lea
had
helped
me
a
good
deal
in
the
old
days
he
had
helped
everybody
for
that
matter
you
would
probably
find
traces
of
lea
influence
in
the
beginnings
of
every
writer
of
about
my
decade
of
everybody
who
ever
did
anything
decent
and
of
some
who
never
got
beyond
the
stage
of
burgeoning
decently
he
had
given
me
the
material
help
that
a
publisher
reader
could
give
until
his
professional
reputation
was
endangered
and
he
had
given
me
the
more
valuable
help
that
so
few
can
give
i
had
grown
ashamed
of
this
friendship
it
was
indeed
partly
because
of
that
that
i
had
taken
to
the
wilds
to
a
hut
near
a
wood
and
all
the
rest
of
what
now
seemed
youthful
foolishness
i
had
desired
to
live
alone
not
to
be
helped
any
more
until
i
could
make
return
as
a
natural
result
i
had
lost
nearly
all
my
friends
and
found
myself
standing
there
as
naked
as
on
the
day
i
was
born
all
around
me
stretched
an
immense
town
an
immense
blackness
people
thousands
of
people
hurried
past
me
had
errands
had
aims
had
others
to
talk
to
to
trifle
with
but
i
had
nobody
this
immense
city
this
immense
blackness
had
no
interiors
for
me
there
were
house
fronts
staring
windows
closed
doors
but
nothing
within
no
rooms
no
hollow
places
the
houses
meant
nothing
to
me
nothing
more
than
the
solid
earth
lea
remained
the
only
one
the
thought
of
whom
was
not
like
the
reconsideration
of
an
ancient
a
musty
pair
of
gloves
he
lived
just
anywhere
being
a
publisher
reader
he
had
to
report
upon
the
probable
commercial
value
of
the
manuscripts
that
unknown
authors
sent
to
his
employer
and
i
suppose
he
had
a
settled
plan
of
life
of
the
sort
that
brought
him
within
the
radius
of
a
given
spot
at
apparently
irregular
but
probably
ordered
intervals
it
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
a
piece
of
good
luck
that
let
me
find
him
that
night
in
a
little
room
in
one
of
the
of
bloomsbury
he
was
sprawling
angularly
on
a
cane
lounge
surrounded
by
whole
rubbish
heaps
of
manuscript
a
grey
scrawl
in
a
foam
of
soiled
paper
he
peered
up
at
me
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
hullo
he
said
what
brought
you
here
have
a
manuscript
he
waved
an
abstracted
hand
round
him
you
find
a
chair
somewhere
a
claret
bottle
stood
on
the
floor
beside
him
he
took
it
by
the
neck
and
passed
it
to
me
he
bent
his
head
again
and
continued
his
reading
i
displaced
three
bulky
folio
sheaves
of
typewritten
matter
from
a
chair
and
seated
myself
behind
him
he
continued
to
read
i
had
seen
these
rooms
before
i
said
for
want
of
something
to
say
the
room
was
not
so
much
scantily
as
arbitrarily
furnished
it
contained
a
big
mahogany
sideboard
a
common
deal
table
an
extraordinary
kind
of
folding
a
deal
bookshelf
the
cane
lounge
and
three
unrelated
chairs
there
were
three
framed
dutch
prints
on
the
marble
striped
curtains
before
the
windows
a
square
cheap
with
a
razor
above
it
hung
between
them
and
on
the
floor
on
the
chairs
on
the
sideboard
on
the
unmade
bed
the
profusion
of
manuscripts
he
scribbled
something
on
a
blue
paper
and
began
to
roll
a
cigarette
he
took
off
his
glasses
rubbed
them
and
closed
his
eyes
tightly
well
and
how
sussex
he
asked
i
felt
a
sudden
attack
of
what
essentially
was
nostalgia
the
fact
that
i
was
really
leaving
an
old
course
of
life
was
actually
and
finally
breaking
with
it
became
vividly
apparent
lea
you
see
stood
for
what
was
best
in
the
mode
of
thought
that
i
was
casting
aside
he
stood
for
the
aspiration
the
brooding
the
moodiness
all
the
childish
qualities
were
my
own
importations
i
was
a
little
ashamed
to
tell
him
that
that
i
was
going
to
live
in
fact
some
of
the
glory
of
it
had
gone
as
if
one
of
two
candles
i
had
been
reading
by
had
flickered
out
but
i
told
him
after
a
fashion
that
i
had
got
a
job
at
last
oh
i
congratulate
you
he
said
you
see
i
began
to
combat
the
objections
he
had
not
had
time
to
utter
even
for
my
work
it
will
be
a
good
thing
i
was
seeing
enough
of
life
to
be
able
to
oh
of
course
not
he
answered
it
be
a
good
thing
you
must
have
been
having
a
pretty
bad
time
it
struck
me
as
abominably
unfair
i
had
taken
up
with
the
because
i
was
tired
of
having
a
bad
time
but
for
other
reasons
because
i
had
felt
my
soul
being
crushed
within
me
you
mistaken
i
said
and
i
explained
he
answered
yes
yes
but
i
fancied
that
he
was
adding
to
himself
they
all
say
that
i
grew
more
angry
lea
opinion
formed
to
some
extent
the
background
of
my
life
for
many
years
i
had
been
writing
quite
as
much
to
satisfy
him
as
to
satisfy
myself
and
his
coldness
chilled
me
he
thought
that
my
heart
was
not
in
my
work
and
i
did
not
want
lea
to
think
that
of
me
i
tried
to
explain
as
much
to
him
but
it
was
difficult
and
he
gave
me
no
help
i
knew
there
had
been
others
that
he
had
fostered
only
to
see
them
in
the
end
drift
into
the
and
now
he
thought
i
was
going
too
here
he
said
suddenly
breaking
away
from
the
subject
look
at
that
he
threw
a
heavy
mass
of
matter
into
my
lap
and
recommenced
writing
his
report
upon
its
saleability
as
a
book
he
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
too
delicately
good
to
attract
his
employer
class
of
readers
i
began
to
read
it
to
get
rid
of
my
thoughts
the
heavy
black
handwriting
of
the
manuscript
sticks
in
my
mind
eye
it
must
have
been
good
but
probably
not
so
good
as
i
then
thought
it
i
have
entirely
forgotten
all
about
it
otherwise
i
remember
that
we
argued
afterward
i
for
its
publication
he
against
i
was
thinking
of
the
wretched
author
whose
fate
hung
in
the
balance
he
became
a
pathetic
possibility
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
white
paper
that
bore
of
a
kind
too
good
to
be
marketable
there
was
something
appalling
in
lea
careless
oh
it
too
good
he
was
used
to
it
but
as
for
me
in
arguing
that
man
case
i
suddenly
became
aware
that
i
was
pleading
my
own
pleading
the
case
of
my
better
work
everything
that
lea
said
of
this
work
of
this
man
applied
to
my
work
and
to
myself
there
no
market
for
that
sort
of
thing
no
public
this
book
been
all
round
the
trade
i
had
it
before
the
man
will
never
come
to
the
front
he
take
to
and
that
will
finish
him
off
what
he
said
and
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
of
me
some
one
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
room
tentative
knocks
of
rather
flabby
knuckles
it
was
one
of
those
sounds
that
one
does
not
notice
immediately
the
man
might
have
been
knocking
for
ten
minutes
it
happened
to
be
employer
the
publisher
of
my
first
book
he
opened
the
door
at
last
and
came
in
rather
peremptorily
he
had
the
air
of
having
worked
himself
into
a
temper
of
being
intellectually
rather
afraid
of
lea
but
of
being
for
this
occasion
determined
to
assert
himself
the
introduction
to
myself
i
had
never
met
him
which
took
place
after
he
had
hastily
brought
out
half
a
sentence
or
so
had
the
effect
of
putting
him
out
of
his
stride
but
after
having
remotely
acknowledged
the
possibility
of
my
existence
he
began
again
the
matter
was
one
of
some
delicacy
i
myself
should
have
hesitated
to
broach
it
before
a
third
party
even
one
so
negligible
as
myself
but
polehampton
apparently
did
not
he
had
to
catch
the
last
post
lea
it
appeared
had
advised
him
to
publish
a
manuscript
by
a
man
called
howden
a
moderately
known
writer
but
i
am
disturbed
to
find
lea
that
is
my
daughter
tells
me
that
the
manuscript
is
not
is
not
at
all
the
thing
in
fact
quite
and
eh
i
suppose
it
too
late
to
draw
back
oh
it
altogether
too
late
for
lea
said
nonchalantly
besides
howden
theories
always
sell
oh
yes
of
course
of
course
polehampton
interjected
hastily
but
do
you
think
now
i
mean
taking
into
consideration
the
damage
it
may
do
our
reputation
that
we
ought
to
ask
howden
to
accept
say
fifty
pounds
less
than
i
should
think
it
an
excellent
idea
lea
said
polehampton
glanced
at
him
suspiciously
then
turned
to
me
you
see
he
began
to
explain
one
has
to
be
careful
about
these
things
oh
i
can
quite
understand
i
answered
there
was
something
so
naïve
in
the
man
point
of
view
that
i
had
felt
my
heart
go
out
to
him
and
he
had
taught
me
at
last
how
it
is
that
the
godly
grow
fat
at
the
expense
of
the
unrighteous
polehampton
however
was
not
fat
he
was
even
rather
thin
and
his
peaked
grey
hair
though
it
was
actually
well
brushed
looked
as
if
it
ought
not
to
have
been
he
had
even
an
anxious
expression
people
said
he
speculated
in
some
stock
or
other
and
i
should
say
they
were
right
i
eh
believe
i
published
your
first
book
i
lost
money
by
it
but
i
can
assure
you
that
i
bear
no
grudge
almost
a
hundred
pounds
i
bear
no
grudge
the
man
was
an
original
he
had
no
idea
that
i
might
feel
insulted
indeed
he
really
wanted
to
be
pleasant
and
condescending
and
forgiving
i
did
feel
insulted
he
was
too
big
for
his
clothes
gave
that
impression
at
least
and
he
wore
black
kid
gloves
moreover
his
eyes
never
left
the
cornice
of
the
room
i
saw
him
rather
often
after
that
night
but
never
without
his
gloves
and
never
with
his
eyes
lowered
and
eh
he
asked
what
are
you
doing
now
mr
granger
lea
told
him
fox
had
taken
me
up
that
i
was
going
to
go
i
suddenly
remembered
it
was
said
of
fox
that
everyone
he
took
up
did
go
the
fact
was
obviously
patent
to
polehampton
he
unbent
with
remarkable
suddenness
it
reminded
me
of
the
abrupt
closing
of
a
stiff
umbrella
he
became
distinctly
and
crudely
cordial
hoped
that
we
should
work
together
again
once
more
reminded
me
that
he
had
published
my
first
book
the
words
had
a
different
savour
now
and
was
enchanted
to
discover
that
we
were
neighbours
in
sussex
my
cottage
was
within
four
miles
of
his
villa
and
we
were
members
of
the
same
golf
club
we
must
have
a
game
several
games
he
said
he
struck
me
as
the
sort
of
man
to
find
a
difficulty
in
getting
anyone
to
play
with
him
after
that
he
went
away
as
i
had
said
i
did
not
dislike
him
he
was
pathetic
but
his
tone
of
mind
his
sudden
change
of
front
unnerved
me
it
proved
so
absolutely
that
i
was
going
to
go
and
i
did
not
want
to
go
in
that
sense
the
thing
is
a
little
difficult
to
explain
i
wanted
to
take
the
job
because
i
wanted
to
have
money
for
a
little
time
for
a
year
or
so
but
if
i
once
began
to
go
the
temptation
would
be
strong
to
keep
on
going
and
i
was
by
no
means
sure
that
i
should
be
able
to
resist
the
temptation
so
many
others
had
failed
what
if
i
wrote
to
fox
and
resigned
lea
was
deep
in
a
manuscript
once
more
shall
i
throw
it
up
i
asked
suddenly
i
wanted
the
thing
settled
oh
go
on
with
it
by
all
means
go
on
with
it
lea
answered
and
i
postulated
take
your
chance
of
the
rest
he
supplied
you
had
a
pretty
bad
time
i
suppose
i
reflected
if
i
have
got
the
strength
of
mind
to
get
out
of
it
in
time
i
not
up
to
much
there
that
too
he
commented
the
game
may
not
be
worth
the
candle
i
was
silent
you
must
take
your
chance
when
you
get
it
he
added
he
had
resumed
his
reading
but
he
looked
up
again
when
i
gave
way
as
i
did
after
a
moment
thought
of
course
he
said
it
will
probably
be
all
right
you
do
your
best
it
a
good
thing
might
even
do
you
good
in
that
way
the
thing
went
through
as
i
was
leaving
the
room
the
idea
occurred
to
me
by
the
way
you
do
know
anything
of
a
clique
the
dimensionists
dimensionists
never
heard
of
them
he
negatived
what
their
specialty
they
going
to
inherit
the
earth
i
answered
oh
i
wish
them
joy
he
closed
you
do
happen
to
be
one
yourself
i
believe
it
a
sort
of
secret
society
he
was
listening
i
went
out
quietly
the
night
effects
of
that
particular
neighbourhood
have
always
affected
me
dismally
that
night
they
upset
me
upset
me
in
much
the
same
way
acting
on
much
the
same
nerves
as
the
valley
in
which
i
had
walked
with
that
puzzling
girl
i
remembered
that
she
had
said
she
stood
for
the
future
that
she
was
a
symbol
of
my
own
decay
the
whole
silly
farrago
in
fact
i
reasoned
with
myself
that
i
was
tired
out
of
trim
and
so
on
that
i
was
in
a
fit
state
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
any
nightmare
i
plunged
into
southampton
row
there
was
safety
in
the
contact
with
the
crowd
in
jostling
in
being
jostled
chapter
six
it
was
saturday
and
as
was
his
custom
during
the
session
the
foreign
secretary
had
gone
for
privacy
and
rest
till
monday
to
a
small
country
house
he
had
within
easy
reach
of
town
i
went
down
with
a
letter
from
fox
in
my
pocket
and
early
in
the
afternoon
found
myself
talking
without
any
kind
of
inward
disturbance
to
the
minister
aunt
a
lean
elderly
lady
with
a
keen
eye
and
credited
with
a
profound
knowledge
of
european
politics
she
had
a
rather
abrupt
manner
and
a
brown
scheme
of
coloration
she
looked
people
very
straight
in
the
face
bringing
to
bear
all
the
penetration
which
as
rumour
said
enabled
her
to
take
a
hidden
but
very
real
part
in
the
shaping
of
our
foreign
policy
she
seemed
to
catalogue
me
label
me
and
lay
me
on
the
shelf
before
i
had
given
my
first
answer
to
her
first
question
you
ought
to
know
this
part
of
the
country
well
she
said
i
think
she
was
considering
me
as
a
possible
canvasser
an
infinitesimal
thing
but
of
a
kind
possibly
worth
remembrance
at
the
next
general
election
no
i
said
i
never
been
here
before
etchingham
is
only
three
miles
away
it
was
new
to
me
to
be
looked
upon
as
worth
consideration
for
my
i
realised
that
miss
churchill
accorded
me
toleration
on
its
account
that
i
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
grangers
of
etchingham
who
had
taken
to
literature
i
met
your
aunt
yesterday
miss
churchill
continued
she
had
met
everybody
yesterday
yes
i
said
i
wondered
what
had
happened
at
that
meeting
my
aunt
and
i
had
never
been
upon
terms
she
was
a
great
personage
in
her
part
of
the
world
a
great
dowager
as
poor
as
a
mouse
and
as
respectable
as
a
hen
she
was
moreover
a
keen
politician
on
the
side
of
miss
churchill
i
who
am
neither
nor
respectable
nor
politician
had
never
been
acknowledged
but
i
knew
that
for
the
sake
of
the
race
she
would
have
refrained
from
enlarging
on
my
shortcomings
has
she
found
a
companion
to
suit
her
yet
i
said
i
was
thinking
of
an
old
legend
of
my
mother
miss
churchill
looked
me
in
between
the
eyes
again
she
was
preparing
to
relabel
me
i
think
i
had
become
a
spiteful
humourist
possibly
i
might
be
useful
for
platform
malice
why
yes
she
said
the
faintest
of
twinkles
in
her
eyes
she
has
adopted
a
niece
the
legend
went
that
at
a
hotly
contested
election
in
which
my
aunt
had
played
a
prominent
part
a
rainbow
poster
had
beset
the
walls
who
starved
her
governess
it
had
inquired
my
accidental
reference
to
such
electioneering
details
placed
me
upon
an
excellent
footing
with
miss
churchill
i
seemed
quite
unawares
to
have
asserted
myself
a
social
equal
a
person
not
to
be
treated
as
a
casual
journalist
i
became
in
fact
not
the
representative
of
the
but
an
etchingham
granger
that
competitive
forces
had
compelled
to
accept
a
journalistic
plum
i
began
to
see
the
line
i
was
to
take
throughout
my
interviewing
campaign
on
the
one
hand
i
was
one
of
us
who
had
temporarily
strayed
beyond
the
pale
on
the
other
i
was
to
be
a
sort
of
great
author
a
side
door
behind
miss
churchill
opened
gently
there
was
something
very
characteristic
in
the
tentative
manner
of
its
coming
ajar
it
seemed
to
say
why
any
noisy
vigour
it
seemed
to
be
propelled
by
a
contemplative
person
with
many
things
on
his
mind
a
tall
grey
man
in
the
doorway
leaned
the
greater
part
of
his
weight
on
the
arm
that
was
stretched
down
to
the
handle
he
was
looking
thoughtfully
at
a
letter
that
he
held
in
his
other
hand
a
face
familiar
enough
in
caricatures
suddenly
grew
real
to
me
more
real
than
the
face
of
one
nearest
friends
yet
older
than
one
had
any
wish
to
expect
it
was
as
if
i
had
gazed
more
intently
than
usual
at
the
face
of
a
man
i
saw
daily
and
had
found
him
older
and
greyer
than
he
had
ever
seemed
before
as
if
i
had
begun
to
realise
that
the
world
had
moved
on
he
said
languidly
almost
protestingly
what
am
i
to
do
about
the
duc
de
mersch
miss
churchill
turned
swiftly
almost
apprehensively
toward
him
she
uttered
my
name
and
he
gave
the
slightest
of
starts
of
annoyance
a
start
that
meant
why
was
i
warned
before
this
irritated
me
i
knew
well
enough
what
were
his
relations
with
de
mersch
and
the
man
took
me
for
a
little
eavesdropper
i
suppose
his
attitudes
were
rather
grotesque
of
the
sort
that
would
pass
in
a
person
of
his
eminence
he
stuck
his
on
the
end
of
his
nose
looked
at
me
took
them
off
and
looked
again
he
had
the
air
of
looking
down
from
an
immense
height
of
needing
a
telescope
oh
ah
granger
son
i
presume
i
was
aware
the
hesitation
of
his
manner
made
me
feel
as
if
we
never
should
get
anywhere
not
for
years
and
years
no
i
said
rather
brusquely
i
only
from
the
he
thought
me
one
of
fox
messengers
then
said
that
fox
might
have
written
have
saved
you
the
trouble
i
mean
or
he
had
the
air
of
wishing
to
be
amiable
of
wishing
even
to
please
me
by
proving
that
he
was
aware
of
my
identity
oh
i
said
a
little
loftily
i
have
any
message
i
only
come
to
interview
you
an
expression
of
dismay
sharpened
the
lines
of
his
face
to
he
began
but
i
never
allowed
he
recovered
himself
sharply
and
set
the
glasses
vigorously
on
his
nose
at
last
he
had
found
the
right
track
oh
i
remember
now
he
said
i
had
looked
at
it
in
that
way
the
whole
thing
grated
on
my
and
i
became
in
a
contained
way
furiously
angry
i
was
impressed
with
the
idea
that
the
man
was
only
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
fox
and
de
mersch
and
that
lot
and
he
gave
himself
these
airs
of
enormous
distance
i
at
any
rate
was
in
the
matter
i
had
any
axe
to
grind
ah
yes
he
said
hastily
you
are
to
draw
my
portrait
as
fox
put
it
he
sent
me
your
jenkins
sketch
i
read
it
it
struck
a
very
nice
note
and
so
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
preposterously
low
chair
his
knees
on
a
level
with
his
chin
i
muttered
that
i
feared
he
would
find
the
process
a
bore
not
more
for
me
than
for
you
he
answered
seriously
one
has
to
do
these
things
why
yes
i
echoed
one
has
to
do
these
things
it
struck
me
that
he
regretted
it
regretted
it
intensely
that
he
attached
a
bitter
meaning
to
the
words
and
what
is
the
procedure
he
asked
after
a
pause
i
am
new
to
the
sort
of
thing
he
had
the
air
i
thought
of
talking
to
some
respectable
tradesman
that
one
calls
in
only
when
one
is
to
a
distinguished
pawnbroker
a
man
quite
at
the
top
of
a
tree
of
inferior
timber
oh
for
the
matter
of
that
so
am
i
i
answered
i
supposed
to
get
your
atmosphere
as
callan
put
it
indeed
he
answered
absently
and
then
after
a
pause
you
know
callan
i
was
afraid
i
should
fall
in
his
estimation
one
has
to
do
these
things
i
said
i
just
been
getting
his
atmosphere
he
looked
again
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
smoothed
his
necktie
and
was
silent
i
realised
that
i
was
in
the
way
but
i
was
still
so
disturbed
that
i
forgot
how
to
phrase
an
excuse
for
a
momentary
absence
perhaps
i
began
he
looked
at
me
attentively
i
mean
i
think
i
in
the
way
i
blurted
out
well
he
answered
it
quite
a
small
matter
but
if
you
are
to
get
my
atmosphere
we
may
as
well
begin
out
of
doors
he
hesitated
pleased
with
his
witticism
unless
you
tired
he
added
i
will
go
and
get
ready
i
said
as
if
i
were
a
lady
with
to
tie
i
was
conducted
to
my
room
where
i
kicked
my
heels
for
a
decent
interval
when
i
descended
churchill
was
lounging
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
and
his
head
hanging
limply
over
his
chest
he
said
ah
on
seeing
me
as
if
he
had
forgotten
my
existence
he
paused
for
a
long
moment
looked
meditatively
at
himself
in
the
glass
over
the
fireplace
and
then
grew
brisk
come
along
he
said
we
took
a
longish
walk
through
a
lush
meadow
land
we
talked
about
a
number
of
things
he
opening
the
ball
with
that
infernal
jenkins
sketch
i
was
in
the
stage
at
which
one
is
sick
of
the
thing
tired
of
the
bare
idea
of
it
and
churchill
laboriously
kind
phrases
made
the
matter
no
better
you
know
who
jenkins
stands
for
i
asked
i
wanted
to
get
away
on
the
side
issues
oh
i
guessed
it
was
he
answered
they
said
that
churchill
was
an
enthusiast
for
the
school
of
painting
of
which
jenkins
was
the
last
exponent
he
began
to
ask
questions
about
him
did
he
still
paint
was
he
even
alive
i
once
saw
several
of
his
pictures
he
reflected
his
work
certainly
appealed
to
me
yes
it
appealed
to
me
i
meant
at
the
time
but
one
forgets
there
are
so
many
things
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
man
wished
by
these
detached
sentences
to
convey
that
he
had
the
weight
of
a
kingdom
of
several
kingdoms
on
his
mind
that
he
could
spare
no
more
than
a
fragment
of
his
thoughts
for
everyday
use
you
must
take
me
to
see
him
he
said
suddenly
i
ought
to
have
something
i
thought
of
poor
jenkins
and
of
his
long
struggle
with
adversity
it
seemed
a
little
cruel
that
churchill
should
talk
in
that
way
without
meaning
a
word
of
it
as
if
the
words
were
a
polite
formality
nothing
would
delight
me
more
i
answered
and
added
nothing
in
the
world
he
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
such
and
such
a
picture
talked
of
artists
and
praised
this
and
that
man
very
fittingly
but
with
a
certain
timidity
a
timidity
that
lured
me
back
to
my
normally
overbearing
frame
of
mind
in
such
matters
i
was
used
to
hearing
my
own
voice
i
could
talk
a
man
down
and
with
a
feeling
of
the
unfitness
of
things
i
talked
churchill
down
the
position
even
then
struck
me
as
gently
humorous
it
was
as
if
some
infinitely
small
animal
were
bullying
some
colossus
among
the
beasts
i
was
of
no
account
in
the
world
he
had
his
say
among
the
olympians
and
i
talked
recklessly
like
any
little
and
he
swallowed
it
we
reached
the
broad
of
a
little
red
and
grey
home
county
town
a
place
of
but
one
street
dominated
by
a
great
of
an
enormous
white
post
the
effigy
of
of
gracious
memory
swung
lazily
creaking
overhead
this
is
etchingham
churchill
said
it
was
a
pleasant
commentary
on
the
course
of
time
this
entry
into
the
home
of
my
ancestors
i
had
been
without
the
pale
for
so
long
that
i
had
never
seen
the
haunt
of
ancient
peace
they
had
done
very
little
the
grangers
of
etchingham
never
anything
but
live
at
etchingham
and
quarrel
at
etchingham
and
die
at
etchingham
and
be
the
monstrous
important
grangers
of
etchingham
my
father
had
had
the
undesirable
touch
not
of
the
genius
but
of
the
bohemian
the
grangers
of
etchingham
had
cut
him
adrift
and
he
had
swum
to
sink
in
other
seas
now
i
was
the
last
of
the
grangers
and
as
things
went
was
quite
the
best
known
of
all
of
them
they
had
grown
poor
in
their
generation
they
bade
fair
to
sink
even
as
it
seemed
i
bade
fair
to
rise
and
i
had
come
back
to
the
old
places
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
i
wondered
what
the
portentous
old
woman
who
ruled
alone
in
etchingham
thought
of
these
times
the
portentous
old
woman
who
ruled
so
they
said
the
place
with
a
rod
of
iron
who
made
herself
unbearable
to
her
companions
and
had
to
fall
back
upon
an
unfortunate
niece
i
wondered
idly
who
the
niece
could
be
certainly
not
a
granger
of
etchingham
for
i
was
the
only
one
of
the
breed
one
of
her
own
nieces
most
probably
churchill
had
gone
into
the
leaving
me
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
it
was
a
pleasant
summer
day
the
air
very
clear
the
place
very
slumbrous
i
looked
up
the
street
at
a
pair
of
great
stone
august
in
their
way
standing
distinctly
aloof
from
the
common
houses
a
little
staidly
lichened
at
the
top
of
each
column
sat
a
sculptured
wolf
as
far
as
i
knew
my
own
crest
it
struck
me
pleasantly
that
this
must
be
the
entrance
of
the
manor
house
the
tall
iron
gates
swung
inward
and
i
saw
a
girl
on
a
bicycle
curve
out
at
the
top
of
the
sunny
street
she
glided
very
clear
small
and
defined
against
the
glowing
wall
leaned
aslant
for
the
turn
and
came
shining
down
toward
me
my
heart
leapt
she
brought
the
whole
thing
into
composition
the
whole
of
that
slumbrous
sunny
street
the
bright
sky
fell
back
into
place
the
red
roofs
the
blue
shadows
the
red
and
blue
of
the
the
blue
of
the
pigeons
walking
round
my
feet
the
bright
red
of
a
postman
cart
she
was
gliding
toward
me
growing
and
growing
into
the
central
figure
she
descended
and
stood
close
to
me
you
i
said
what
blessed
chance
brought
you
here
oh
i
am
your
aunt
companion
she
answered
her
niece
you
know
then
you
be
a
cousin
i
said
no
sister
she
corrected
i
assure
you
it
sister
ask
anyone
ask
your
aunt
i
was
braced
into
a
state
of
puzzled
buoyancy
but
really
you
know
i
said
she
was
smiling
standing
up
squarely
to
me
leaning
a
little
back
swaying
her
machine
with
the
motion
of
her
body
it
a
little
ridiculous
is
it
she
said
very
i
answered
but
even
at
that
i
do
see
and
i
not
phenomenally
dense
not
phenomenally
she
answered
considering
that
i
not
a
not
a
dimensionist
i
bantered
but
you
have
really
palmed
yourself
off
on
my
aunt
really
she
answered
she
does
know
any
better
she
believes
in
me
immensely
i
am
such
a
real
granger
there
never
was
a
more
typical
one
and
we
shake
our
heads
together
over
you
my
bewilderment
was
infinite
but
it
stopped
short
of
being
unpleasant
might
i
call
on
my
aunt
i
asked
it
would
interfere
oh
it
would
she
said
but
we
leave
for
paris
we
are
very
busy
we
that
is
my
aunt
i
am
too
young
and
too
too
discreet
have
a
little
salon
where
we
hatch
plots
against
half
the
régimes
in
europe
you
have
no
idea
how
legitimate
we
are
i
do
understand
in
the
least
i
said
not
in
the
least
oh
you
must
take
me
literally
if
you
want
to
understand
she
answered
and
you
wo
do
that
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
find
my
account
in
unsettled
states
and
that
i
am
unsettling
them
everywhere
you
will
see
she
spoke
with
her
monstrous
dispassionateness
and
i
felt
a
shiver
pass
down
my
spine
very
distinctly
i
was
thinking
what
she
might
do
if
ever
she
became
in
earnest
and
if
ever
i
chanced
to
stand
in
her
way
as
her
husband
for
example
i
wish
you
would
talk
sense
for
one
blessed
minute
i
said
i
want
to
get
things
a
little
settled
in
my
mind
oh
i
talk
sense
she
said
by
the
hour
but
you
wo
listen
take
your
friend
churchill
now
he
the
man
that
we
going
to
bring
down
i
mentioned
it
to
you
and
so
but
this
is
sheer
madness
i
answered
oh
no
it
a
bald
statement
of
fact
she
went
on
i
do
see
how
i
said
involuntarily
your
article
in
the
will
help
every
trifle
will
help
she
said
things
that
you
understand
and
others
that
you
can
not
he
is
identifying
himself
with
the
duc
de
mersch
that
looks
nothing
but
fatal
there
will
be
friendships
and
desertions
ah
i
said
i
had
had
an
inkling
of
this
and
it
made
me
respect
her
insight
into
home
politics
she
must
have
been
alluding
to
gurnard
whom
everybody
perhaps
from
fear
pretended
to
trust
she
looked
at
me
and
smiled
again
it
was
still
the
same
smile
she
was
not
radiant
and
pensive
do
you
know
i
do
like
to
hear
that
i
began
oh
there
irony
in
it
and
pathos
and
that
sort
of
thing
she
said
with
the
remotest
chill
of
mockery
in
her
intonation
he
goes
into
it
enough
and
he
only
half
likes
it
but
he
sees
that
it
his
last
chance
it
not
that
he
worn
out
but
he
feels
that
his
time
has
come
unless
he
does
something
and
so
he
going
to
do
something
you
understand
not
in
the
least
i
said
oh
it
the
system
for
the
regeneration
of
the
arctic
regions
the
greenland
affair
of
my
friend
de
mersch
churchill
is
going
to
make
a
grand
coup
with
that
to
keep
himself
from
slipping
down
hill
and
of
course
it
would
add
immensely
to
your
national
prestige
and
he
only
half
sees
what
de
mersch
is
or
this
is
all
greek
to
me
i
muttered
rebelliously
oh
i
know
i
know
she
said
but
one
has
to
do
these
things
and
i
want
you
to
understand
so
churchill
does
like
the
whole
business
but
he
under
the
shadow
he
been
thinking
a
good
deal
lately
that
his
day
is
over
i
prove
it
to
you
in
a
minute
and
so
oh
going
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
get
in
touch
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
that
he
does
like
and
does
understand
so
he
lets
you
get
his
atmosphere
that
all
oh
that
i
said
ironically
of
course
he
have
liked
to
go
on
playing
the
to
chaps
like
you
and
me
she
mimicked
the
tone
and
words
of
fox
himself
this
is
witchcraft
i
said
how
in
the
world
do
you
know
what
fox
said
to
me
oh
i
know
she
said
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
playing
me
with
all
this
nonsense
as
if
she
must
have
known
that
i
had
a
tenderness
for
her
and
were
fooling
me
to
the
top
of
her
bent
i
tried
to
get
my
hook
in
now
look
here
i
said
we
must
get
things
settled
you
she
carried
the
speech
off
from
under
my
nose
oh
you
wo
denounce
me
she
said
not
any
more
than
you
did
before
there
are
so
many
reasons
there
would
be
a
scene
and
afraid
of
scenes
and
our
aunt
would
back
up
she
have
to
my
money
has
been
reviving
the
glories
of
the
grangers
you
can
see
they
been
regilding
the
gate
i
looked
almost
involuntarily
at
the
tall
iron
gates
through
which
she
had
passed
into
my
view
it
was
true
enough
some
of
the
scroll
work
was
radiant
with
new
gold
well
i
said
i
will
give
you
credit
for
not
wishing
to
to
prey
upon
my
aunt
but
still
i
was
trying
to
make
the
thing
out
it
struck
me
that
she
was
an
american
of
the
kind
that
subsidizes
households
like
that
of
etchingham
manor
perhaps
my
aunt
had
even
forced
her
to
take
the
family
name
to
save
appearances
the
old
woman
was
capable
of
anything
even
of
providing
an
obscure
nephew
with
a
brilliant
sister
and
i
should
not
be
thanked
if
i
interfered
this
skeleton
of
swift
reasoning
passed
between
word
and
word
you
are
no
sister
of
mine
i
was
continuing
my
sentence
quite
amiably
her
face
brightened
to
greet
someone
approaching
behind
me
did
you
hear
him
she
said
you
hear
him
churchill
he
casts
off
he
disowns
me
is
he
a
stern
brother
and
the
quarrel
is
about
nothing
the
impudence
or
the
presence
of
mind
of
it
overwhelmed
me
churchill
smiled
pleasantly
oh
one
always
quarrels
about
nothing
churchill
answered
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
her
about
my
aunt
about
the
way
her
machine
ran
that
sort
of
thing
he
behaved
toward
her
as
if
she
were
an
indulged
child
impertinent
with
licence
and
welcome
enough
he
himself
looked
rather
like
the
but
indulgent
and
very
meagre
lion
that
peers
at
the
unicorn
across
a
so
you
are
going
back
to
paris
he
said
miss
churchill
will
be
sorry
and
you
are
going
to
continue
to
to
break
up
the
universe
oh
yes
she
answered
we
are
going
on
with
that
my
aunt
would
never
give
it
up
she
could
you
know
you
get
into
trouble
churchill
said
as
if
he
were
talking
to
a
child
intent
on
stealing
apples
and
when
is
our
turn
coming
going
to
restore
the
stuarts
are
you
it
was
his
idea
of
badinage
amiable
without
consequence
oh
not
quite
that
she
answered
not
that
it
was
curious
to
watch
her
talking
to
another
man
to
a
man
not
a
bagman
like
callan
she
put
aside
the
face
she
always
showed
me
and
became
at
once
what
churchill
took
her
for
a
spoiled
child
at
times
she
suggested
a
certain
kind
of
american
and
had
that
indefinable
air
of
glib
acquaintance
with
the
names
and
none
of
the
spirit
of
tradition
one
half
expected
her
to
utter
rhapsodies
about
oh
you
know
she
said
with
a
fine
affectation
of
aloofness
we
shall
have
to
be
rather
hard
upon
you
we
shall
crumple
you
up
like
churchill
had
been
moving
his
stick
in
the
dust
of
the
road
he
had
produced
a
big
c
h
u
she
had
erased
it
with
the
point
of
her
foot
like
that
she
concluded
he
laid
his
head
back
and
laughed
almost
heartily
dear
me
he
said
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
so
much
in
the
way
of
of
yourself
and
mrs
granger
oh
it
not
only
that
she
said
with
a
little
smile
and
a
cast
of
the
eye
to
me
but
you
got
to
make
way
for
the
future
churchill
face
changed
suddenly
he
looked
rather
old
and
grey
and
wintry
even
a
little
frail
i
understood
what
she
was
proving
to
me
and
i
rather
disliked
her
for
it
it
seemed
wantonly
cruel
to
remind
a
man
of
what
he
was
trying
to
forget
ah
yes
he
said
with
the
gentle
sadness
of
quite
an
old
man
i
dare
say
there
is
more
in
that
than
you
think
even
you
will
have
to
learn
but
not
for
a
long
time
she
interrupted
audaciously
i
hope
not
he
answered
i
hope
not
she
nodded
and
glided
away
we
resumed
the
road
in
silence
churchill
smiled
at
his
own
thoughts
once
or
twice
a
most
amusing
he
said
at
last
she
does
me
a
great
deal
of
good
a
great
deal
i
think
he
meant
that
she
distracted
his
thoughts
does
she
always
talk
like
that
i
asked
he
had
hardly
spoken
to
me
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
interrupting
a
reverie
but
i
wanted
to
know
i
should
say
she
did
he
answered
i
should
so
but
miss
churchill
says
that
she
has
a
real
genius
for
organization
she
used
to
see
a
good
deal
of
them
before
they
went
to
paris
you
know
what
are
they
doing
there
it
was
as
if
i
were
extracting
secrets
from
a
oh
they
have
a
kind
of
a
meeting
place
for
all
kinds
of
legitimist
pretenders
french
and
spanish
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
believe
granger
takes
it
very
seriously
he
looked
at
me
suddenly
but
you
ought
to
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
he
said
oh
we
see
very
little
of
each
other
i
answered
you
could
hardly
call
us
brother
and
sister
oh
i
see
he
answered
i
do
know
what
he
saw
for
myself
i
saw
nothing
chapter
seven
i
succeeded
in
giving
fox
what
his
journal
wanted
i
got
the
atmosphere
of
churchill
and
his
house
in
a
way
that
satisfied
the
people
for
whom
it
was
meant
his
house
was
a
pleasant
enough
place
of
the
sort
where
they
do
you
well
but
not
nauseously
well
it
stood
in
a
tranquil
countryside
and
stood
there
modestly
architecturally
speaking
it
was
gently
commonplace
one
got
used
to
it
and
liked
it
and
churchill
himself
when
one
had
become
accustomed
to
his
manner
one
liked
very
well
very
well
indeed
he
had
a
dainty
dilettante
mind
delicately
balanced
with
strong
limitations
a
fantastic
temperament
for
a
person
in
his
walk
of
life
but
sane
mind
you
persistent
after
a
time
i
amused
myself
with
a
theory
that
his
heart
was
not
in
his
work
that
circumstance
had
driven
him
into
the
career
of
politics
and
ironical
fate
set
him
at
its
head
for
myself
i
had
an
intense
contempt
for
the
political
mind
and
it
struck
me
that
he
had
some
of
the
same
feeling
he
had
little
personal
quaintnesses
too
a
deference
a
modesty
an
i
was
with
him
for
the
greater
part
of
his
weekend
holiday
hung
perforce
about
him
whenever
he
had
any
leisure
i
suppose
he
found
me
tiresome
but
one
has
to
do
these
things
he
talked
and
i
talked
heavens
how
we
talked
he
was
almost
always
deferential
i
almost
always
dogmatic
perhaps
because
the
conversation
kept
on
my
own
ground
politics
we
never
touched
i
seemed
to
feel
that
if
i
broached
them
i
should
be
checked
politely
but
very
definitely
perhaps
he
actually
contrived
to
convey
as
much
to
me
perhaps
i
evolved
the
idea
that
if
i
were
to
say
what
do
you
think
about
the
system
he
would
answer
i
try
not
to
think
about
it
or
whatever
gently
closuring
phrase
his
mind
conceived
but
i
never
did
so
there
were
so
many
other
topics
he
was
then
writing
his
of
and
his
mind
was
very
full
of
his
subject
once
he
opened
his
heart
after
delicately
sounding
me
for
signs
of
boredom
it
happened
by
the
merest
chance
one
of
those
blind
chances
that
inevitably
lead
in
the
future
that
i
too
was
obsessed
at
that
moment
by
the
lord
oliver
a
great
many
years
before
when
i
was
a
yearling
of
tremendous
plans
i
had
set
about
one
of
those
glorious
novels
that
one
plans
a
splendid
thing
with
old
noll
as
the
hero
or
the
heavy
father
i
had
haunted
the
bookstalls
in
search
of
local
colour
and
had
wonderfully
well
invested
my
thus
a
company
of
seventeenth
century
tracts
coverless
but
very
glorious
under
their
dust
accompany
me
through
life
one
parts
last
with
those
relics
of
a
golden
age
and
during
my
late
convalescence
i
had
reread
many
of
them
the
arbitrary
phrases
suggesting
all
sorts
of
scenes
lamplight
in
squalid
streets
trays
full
of
books
so
even
then
my
mind
was
full
of
mercurius
rusticus
churchill
on
cromwell
amused
me
immensely
and
even
excited
me
it
was
life
this
attending
at
a
of
an
impossible
temperament
it
did
me
good
as
he
had
said
of
my
it
was
fantastic
as
fantastic
as
herself
and
it
came
out
more
in
his
conversation
than
in
the
book
itself
i
had
something
to
do
with
that
of
course
but
imagine
the
treatment
accorded
to
cromwell
by
this
delicate
negative
obstinately
judicial
personality
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
one
wants
to
get
into
a
novel
it
was
a
lesson
to
me
in
temperament
in
point
of
view
i
went
with
his
mood
tried
even
to
outdo
him
in
the
hope
of
spurring
him
to
outdo
himself
i
only
mention
it
because
i
did
it
so
well
that
it
led
to
extraordinary
consequences
we
were
walking
up
and
down
his
lawn
in
the
twilight
after
his
sunday
supper
the
pale
light
shone
along
the
gleaming
laurels
and
dwelt
upon
the
soft
clouds
of
orchard
blossoms
that
shimmered
above
them
it
dwelt
too
upon
the
silver
streaks
in
his
dark
hair
and
made
his
face
seem
more
pallid
and
more
old
it
affected
me
like
some
intense
piece
of
irony
it
was
like
hearing
a
dying
man
talk
of
the
year
after
next
i
had
the
sense
of
the
unreality
of
things
strong
upon
me
why
should
nightingale
upon
nightingale
pour
out
volley
upon
volley
of
song
for
the
delight
of
a
politician
whose
heart
was
not
in
his
task
of
keeping
back
the
waters
of
the
deluge
but
who
grew
animated
at
the
idea
of
damning
one
of
the
titans
who
had
let
loose
the
deluge
about
a
week
after
or
it
may
have
been
a
fortnight
churchill
wrote
to
me
and
asked
me
to
take
him
to
see
the
jenkins
of
my
jenkins
story
it
was
one
of
those
ordeals
that
one
goes
through
when
one
has
tried
to
advance
one
friends
jenkins
took
the
matter
amiss
thought
it
was
a
display
of
insulting
patronage
on
the
part
of
officialism
he
was
reluctant
to
show
his
best
work
the
forgotten
masterpieces
the
things
that
had
never
sold
that
hung
about
on
the
faded
walls
and
rotted
in
cellars
he
would
not
be
his
genial
self
he
would
not
talk
churchill
behaved
very
well
i
think
he
understood
jenkins
thawed
before
his
gentle
appreciations
i
could
see
the
change
operating
within
him
he
began
to
realise
that
this
incredible
visit
from
a
man
who
ought
to
be
hand
and
glove
with
academicians
was
something
other
than
a
spy
encroachment
he
was
old
you
must
remember
and
entirely
unsuccessful
he
had
fought
a
hard
fight
and
had
been
worsted
he
took
his
revenge
in
these
suspicions
we
younger
men
adored
him
he
had
the
ruddy
face
and
the
archaic
silver
hair
of
the
king
of
hearts
and
a
wonderful
elaborate
politeness
that
he
had
inherited
from
his
youth
from
the
days
of
brummell
and
whilst
all
his
belongings
were
rotting
into
dust
he
retained
an
extraordinarily
youthful
and
ingenuous
habit
of
mind
it
was
that
or
a
little
of
it
that
gave
the
charm
to
my
jenkins
story
it
was
a
disagreeable
experience
i
wished
so
much
that
the
perennial
hopefulness
of
the
man
should
at
last
escape
deferring
and
i
was
afraid
that
churchill
would
chill
before
jenkins
had
time
to
thaw
but
as
i
have
said
i
think
churchill
understood
he
smiled
his
kindly
smile
over
canvas
after
canvas
praised
the
right
thing
in
each
remembered
having
seen
this
and
that
in
such
and
such
a
year
and
jenkins
thawed
he
happened
to
leave
the
room
to
fetch
some
studies
to
hurry
up
the
tea
or
for
some
such
reason
bereft
of
his
presence
the
place
suddenly
grew
ghostly
it
was
as
if
the
sun
had
died
in
the
sky
and
left
us
in
that
nether
world
where
dead
buried
pasts
live
in
a
grey
shadowless
light
jenkins
palette
glowed
from
above
a
medley
of
stained
rags
on
his
open
colour
table
the
of
his
chair
resembled
a
thatch
one
can
draw
morals
from
a
life
like
that
i
said
suddenly
i
was
thinking
rather
of
jenkins
than
of
the
man
i
was
talking
to
why
yes
he
said
absently
i
suppose
there
are
men
who
have
the
knack
of
getting
on
it
more
than
a
knack
i
said
with
unnecessary
bitterness
it
a
temperament
i
think
it
a
habit
too
it
may
be
acquired
may
it
no
no
i
fulminated
it
precisely
because
it
ca
be
acquired
that
the
best
men
the
men
like
i
stopped
suddenly
impressed
by
the
idea
that
the
thing
was
out
of
tone
i
had
to
assert
myself
more
than
i
liked
in
talking
to
churchill
otherwise
i
should
have
disappeared
a
word
from
him
had
the
weight
of
three
kingdoms
and
several
colonies
behind
it
and
i
was
forced
to
get
that
out
of
my
head
by
making
conversation
a
mere
matter
of
temperament
in
that
i
was
the
stronger
if
i
wanted
to
say
a
thing
i
said
it
but
he
was
hampered
by
a
judicial
mind
it
seemed
too
that
he
liked
a
dictatorial
interlocutor
else
he
would
hardly
have
brought
himself
into
contact
with
me
again
perhaps
it
was
new
to
him
my
eye
fell
upon
a
couple
of
masks
hanging
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
the
room
was
full
of
a
profusion
of
little
casts
thick
with
dust
upon
the
shoulders
the
hair
the
eyelids
on
every
part
that
projected
outward
i
said
that
a
of
cromwell
ah
he
answered
i
knew
there
he
moved
very
slowly
toward
it
rather
as
if
he
did
not
wish
to
bring
it
within
his
field
of
view
he
stopped
before
reaching
it
and
pivotted
slowly
to
face
me
about
my
book
he
opened
suddenly
i
have
so
little
time
his
briskness
dropped
into
a
half
complaint
like
a
faintly
suggested
avowal
of
impotence
i
have
been
at
it
four
years
now
it
struck
me
you
seemed
to
coincide
so
singularly
with
my
ideas
his
speech
came
wavering
to
a
close
but
he
recommenced
it
apologetically
as
if
he
wished
me
to
help
him
out
i
went
to
see
smithson
the
publisher
about
it
and
he
said
he
had
no
objection
he
looked
appealingly
at
me
i
kept
silence
of
course
it
not
your
sort
of
work
but
you
might
try
you
see
he
came
to
a
sustained
halt
i
do
understand
i
said
rather
coldly
when
the
silence
became
embarrassing
you
want
me
to
for
you
good
gracious
no
he
said
energetically
dear
me
no
then
i
really
do
understand
i
said
i
thought
you
might
see
your
i
wanted
you
to
collaborate
with
me
quite
publicly
of
course
as
far
as
the
epithet
applies
to
collaborate
i
said
slowly
you
i
was
looking
at
a
miniature
of
the
farnese
hercules
i
wondered
what
it
meant
what
club
had
struck
the
wheel
of
my
fortune
and
whirled
it
into
this
astounding
attitude
of
course
you
must
think
about
it
he
said
i
do
know
i
muttered
the
idea
is
so
new
it
so
little
in
my
line
i
do
know
what
i
should
make
of
it
i
talked
at
random
there
were
so
many
thoughts
jostling
in
my
head
it
seemed
to
carry
me
so
much
farther
from
the
kind
of
work
i
wanted
to
do
i
did
not
really
doubt
my
ability
one
does
not
i
rather
regarded
it
as
work
upon
a
lower
plane
and
it
was
a
tremendous
an
incredibly
tremendous
opportunity
you
know
pretty
well
how
much
i
done
he
continued
i
got
a
good
deal
of
material
together
and
a
good
deal
of
the
actual
writing
is
done
but
there
is
ever
so
much
still
to
do
it
getting
beyond
me
as
i
said
just
now
i
looked
at
him
again
rather
incredulously
he
stood
before
me
a
thin
parallelogram
of
black
with
a
mosaic
of
white
about
the
throat
the
slight
grotesqueness
of
the
man
made
him
almost
impossibly
real
in
his
abstracted
earnestness
he
so
much
meant
what
he
said
that
he
ignored
what
his
hands
were
doing
or
his
body
or
his
head
he
had
taken
a
very
small
very
dusty
book
out
of
a
little
shelf
beside
him
and
was
absently
turning
over
the
rusty
leaves
while
he
talked
with
his
head
bent
over
it
what
was
i
to
him
or
he
to
me
i
could
give
my
saturday
afternoons
to
it
he
was
saying
whenever
you
could
come
down
it
immensely
kind
of
you
i
began
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
waived
i
set
my
heart
on
doing
it
and
unless
you
help
me
i
do
suppose
i
ever
shall
get
it
done
but
there
are
hundreds
of
others
i
said
there
may
be
he
said
there
may
be
but
i
have
not
come
across
them
i
was
beset
by
a
sudden
emotion
of
blind
candour
oh
nonsense
nonsense
i
said
do
you
see
that
you
are
offering
me
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
churchill
laughed
after
all
one
can
not
refuse
to
take
what
offers
he
said
besides
your
right
man
to
do
the
work
might
not
suit
me
as
a
collaborator
it
very
tempting
i
said
why
then
succumb
he
smiled
i
could
not
find
arguments
against
him
and
i
succumbed
as
jenkins
the
room
chapter
eight
after
that
i
began
to
live
as
one
lives
and
for
weeks
i
know
it
was
because
i
got
atmospheres
in
all
callan
and
churchill
and
those
and
the
last
one
that
finished
the
job
and
the
year
of
it
it
was
amusing
work
in
its
way
people
mostly
preferred
to
have
their
atmospheres
taken
at
their
country
houses
it
showed
that
they
had
them
i
suppose
thus
i
spent
a
couple
of
days
out
of
every
week
in
agreeable
resorts
and
people
were
very
nice
to
me
it
was
part
of
the
game
so
i
had
a
pretty
good
time
for
a
year
and
enjoyed
it
probably
because
i
had
had
a
pretty
bad
one
for
several
years
i
filled
in
the
rest
of
my
weeks
by
helping
fox
and
collaborating
with
churchill
and
adoring
hartly
at
odd
moments
i
used
to
hang
about
the
office
of
the
on
the
chance
of
snapping
up
a
blank
three
lines
fit
for
a
subtle
puff
of
her
sometimes
they
were
too
hurried
to
be
subtle
and
then
hartly
was
really
pleased
i
never
understood
her
in
the
least
and
i
very
much
doubt
whether
she
ever
understood
a
word
i
said
i
imagine
that
i
must
have
talked
to
her
about
her
art
or
her
mission
things
obviously
as
strange
to
her
as
to
the
excellent
hartly
himself
i
suppose
she
had
any
art
i
am
certain
she
had
any
mission
except
to
be
adored
she
walked
about
the
stage
and
one
adored
her
just
as
she
sat
about
her
flat
and
was
adored
and
there
the
matter
ended
as
for
fox
i
seemed
to
suit
him
i
do
in
the
least
know
why
no
doubt
he
knew
me
better
than
i
knew
myself
he
used
to
get
hold
of
me
whilst
i
was
hanging
about
the
office
on
the
chance
of
engaging
space
for
hartly
and
he
used
to
utilise
me
for
the
ignoblest
things
i
saw
men
for
him
scribbled
notes
for
him
abused
people
through
the
telephone
and
wrote
articles
of
course
there
were
the
pickings
i
never
understood
fox
not
in
the
least
not
more
than
i
understood
hartly
he
had
the
mannerisms
of
the
most
incredible
vulgarian
and
had
apparently
the
point
of
view
of
a
pig
but
there
was
something
else
that
obscured
all
that
that
forced
one
to
call
him
a
man
everyone
called
him
that
he
used
to
say
that
he
knew
what
he
wanted
and
that
he
got
it
and
that
was
true
too
i
did
in
the
least
want
to
do
his
odd
jobs
even
for
the
ensuing
pickings
and
i
want
to
be
with
him
but
i
did
them
and
i
was
without
even
realising
that
it
was
distasteful
to
me
it
was
probably
the
same
with
everybody
else
i
used
to
have
an
idea
that
i
was
going
to
reform
him
that
one
day
i
should
make
him
convert
the
into
an
asylum
for
writers
of
merit
he
used
to
let
me
have
my
own
way
sometimes
just
often
enough
to
keep
my
conscience
from
inconveniencing
me
he
let
me
present
lea
with
an
occasional
column
and
a
half
and
once
he
promised
me
that
one
day
he
would
allow
me
to
get
the
atmosphere
of
arthur
edwards
the
novelist
then
there
was
churchill
and
the
of
that
progressed
slowly
the
experiment
succeeded
well
enough
as
i
grew
less
domineering
and
he
less
embarrassed
toward
the
end
i
seemed
to
have
become
a
familiar
inmate
of
his
house
i
used
to
go
down
with
him
on
saturday
afternoons
and
we
talked
things
over
in
the
train
it
was
to
an
idler
like
myself
wonderful
the
way
that
essential
idler
days
were
cut
out
and
fitted
in
like
the
squares
of
a
child
puzzle
little
passages
of
work
of
one
kind
fitting
into
quite
unrelated
passages
of
something
else
he
did
it
well
too
without
the
remotest
semblance
of
hurry
i
suppose
that
actually
the
motive
power
was
his
aunt
people
used
to
say
so
but
it
did
not
appear
on
the
surface
to
anyone
in
close
contact
with
the
man
or
it
appeared
only
in
very
small
things
we
used
to
work
in
a
tall
dark
pleasant
room
and
giving
on
to
a
lawn
that
was
always
an
asylum
for
furtive
thrushes
miss
churchill
as
a
rule
sat
half
forgotten
near
the
window
with
the
light
falling
over
her
shoulder
she
was
always
very
absorbed
in
papers
seemed
to
be
spending
laborious
days
in
answering
letters
in
evolving
reports
occasionally
she
addressed
a
question
to
her
nephew
occasionally
received
guests
that
came
informally
but
could
not
be
refused
admittance
once
it
was
a
personage
once
the
duc
de
mersch
my
reputed
employer
the
latter
i
remember
was
announced
when
churchill
and
i
were
finally
finishing
our
account
of
the
tremendous
passing
of
the
protector
in
that
silent
room
i
had
a
vivid
sense
of
the
vast
noise
of
the
storm
in
that
twilight
of
the
crowning
mercy
i
seemed
to
see
the
candles
in
the
eddies
of
air
forced
into
the
gloomy
room
the
great
bed
and
the
portentous
uncouth
form
that
struggled
in
the
shadows
of
the
hangings
miss
churchill
looked
up
from
the
card
that
had
been
placed
in
her
hands
edward
she
said
the
duc
de
mersch
churchill
rose
irritably
from
his
low
seat
confound
him
he
said
i
wo
see
him
you
ca
help
it
i
think
his
aunt
said
reflectively
you
will
have
to
settle
it
sooner
or
later
i
know
pretty
well
what
it
was
they
had
to
settle
the
greenland
affair
that
had
hung
in
the
air
so
long
i
knew
it
from
hearsay
from
fox
vaguely
enough
gurnard
was
said
to
recommend
it
for
financial
reasons
the
duc
to
be
eager
churchill
to
hang
back
unaccountably
i
never
had
much
head
for
details
of
this
sort
but
people
used
to
explain
them
to
me
to
explain
the
reasons
for
de
mersch
eagerness
they
were
rather
shabby
rather
incredible
reasons
that
sounded
too
reasonable
to
be
true
he
wanted
the
money
for
his
railways
wanted
it
very
badly
he
was
vastly
in
want
of
money
he
was
this
that
and
the
other
in
certain
concerns
and
had
a
finger
in
this
that
and
the
other
pie
there
was
an
all
round
the
world
cable
company
that
united
hearts
and
hands
and
a
railway
exploration
and
civilisation
company
that
let
in
light
in
dark
places
and
an
international
housing
of
the
poor
company
as
well
as
a
number
of
others
somewhere
at
the
bottom
of
these
seemingly
bottomless
concerns
the
duc
de
mersch
was
said
to
be
moving
and
the
certainly
contained
periodically
complimentary
allusions
to
their
higher
philanthropy
and
prospects
but
that
was
as
much
as
i
knew
the
same
people
people
one
met
in
said
that
the
railway
was
the
last
card
of
de
mersch
british
investors
would
trust
the
duc
without
some
sort
of
guarantee
from
the
british
government
and
no
other
investor
would
trust
him
on
any
terms
england
was
to
guarantee
something
or
other
the
interest
for
a
number
of
years
i
suppose
i
did
believe
them
of
course
one
makes
it
a
practice
to
believe
nothing
of
the
sort
but
i
recognised
that
the
evening
was
momentous
to
somebody
that
gurnard
and
the
duc
de
mersch
and
churchill
were
to
discuss
something
and
that
i
was
remotely
interested
because
the
employed
me
churchill
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
gurnard
dines
here
his
aunt
said
oh
i
see
his
hands
played
with
some
coins
in
his
i
see
he
said
again
they
the
occasion
impressed
me
i
remember
very
well
the
manner
of
both
nephew
and
aunt
they
seemed
to
be
suddenly
called
to
come
to
a
decision
that
was
no
easy
one
that
they
had
wished
to
relegate
to
an
indefinite
future
she
left
churchill
pacing
nervously
up
and
down
i
could
go
on
with
something
else
if
you
like
i
said
but
i
do
like
he
said
energetically
i
much
rather
not
see
the
man
you
know
the
sort
of
person
he
is
why
no
i
answered
i
never
studied
the
almanac
de
gotha
oh
i
forgot
he
said
he
seemed
vexed
with
himself
churchill
dinners
were
frequently
rather
trying
to
me
personages
of
enormous
importance
used
to
drop
in
and
reveal
themselves
as
rather
asinine
at
the
best
of
times
they
sat
dimly
opposite
to
me
discomposed
me
and
disappeared
sometimes
they
stared
me
down
that
night
there
were
two
of
them
gurnard
i
had
heard
of
one
ca
help
hearing
of
a
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
the
books
of
reference
said
that
he
was
the
son
of
one
william
gurnard
of
grimsby
but
i
remember
that
once
in
my
club
a
man
who
professed
to
know
everything
assured
me
that
gurnard
esq
whom
he
had
described
as
a
fish
salesman
was
only
an
adoptive
father
his
rapid
rise
seemed
to
me
inexplicable
till
the
same
man
accounted
for
it
with
a
shrug
when
a
man
of
such
ability
believes
in
nothing
and
sticks
at
nothing
there
no
saying
how
far
he
may
go
he
has
kicked
away
every
ladder
he
does
mean
to
come
down
this
no
doubt
explained
much
but
not
everything
in
his
fabulous
career
his
adherents
called
him
an
inspired
statesman
his
enemies
set
him
down
a
mere
politician
he
was
a
man
of
thin
slightly
bald
and
with
an
icy
assurance
of
manner
he
was
indifferent
to
attacks
upon
his
character
but
crushed
mercilessly
every
one
who
menaced
his
position
he
stood
alone
and
a
little
mysterious
his
own
party
was
afraid
of
him
gurnard
was
quite
hidden
from
me
by
table
ornaments
the
duc
de
mersch
glowed
with
light
and
talked
voluminously
as
if
he
had
for
years
and
years
been
starved
of
human
society
he
glowed
all
over
it
seemed
to
me
he
had
a
glorious
beard
that
let
one
see
very
little
of
his
florid
face
and
took
the
edge
away
from
an
almost
forehead
and
depressingly
wrinkled
eyelids
he
spoke
excellent
english
rather
slowly
as
if
he
were
forever
replying
to
toasts
to
his
health
it
struck
me
that
he
seemed
to
treat
churchill
in
nuances
as
an
inferior
whilst
for
the
invisible
gurnard
he
reserved
an
attitude
of
nervous
he
had
apparently
come
to
dilate
on
the
and
he
dilated
some
mistaken
persons
had
insinuated
that
the
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
corporate
exploitation
of
unhappy
esquimaux
de
mersch
emphatically
declared
that
those
people
were
declared
it
with
official
finality
the
esquimaux
were
not
unhappy
i
paid
attention
to
my
dinner
and
let
the
discourse
on
the
affairs
of
the
hyperborean
protectorate
lapse
into
an
unheeded
murmur
i
tried
to
be
the
simple
amanuensis
at
the
feast
suddenly
however
it
struck
me
that
de
mersch
was
talking
at
me
that
he
had
by
the
merest
shade
raised
his
intonation
he
was
dilating
upon
the
immense
international
value
of
the
proposed
railway
its
importance
to
british
trade
was
indisputable
even
the
opposition
had
no
serious
arguments
to
offer
it
was
the
obvious
duty
of
the
british
government
to
give
the
financial
guarantee
he
would
not
insist
upon
the
moral
aspect
of
the
work
it
was
unnecessary
progress
improvement
civilisation
a
little
less
evil
in
the
world
more
light
it
was
our
duty
not
to
count
the
cost
of
humanising
a
lower
race
besides
the
thing
would
pay
like
another
suez
canal
its
terminus
and
the
british
coaling
station
would
be
on
the
west
coast
of
the
island
i
knew
the
man
was
talking
at
me
i
wondered
why
suddenly
he
turned
his
glowing
countenance
full
upon
me
i
think
i
must
have
met
a
member
of
your
family
he
said
the
solution
occurred
to
me
i
was
a
journalist
he
a
person
interested
in
a
railway
that
he
wished
the
government
to
back
in
some
way
or
another
his
attempts
to
capture
my
suffrage
no
longer
astonished
me
i
murmured
indeed
in
paris
etchingham
granger
he
said
i
said
oh
yes
miss
churchill
came
to
the
rescue
the
duc
de
mersch
means
our
friend
your
aunt
she
explained
i
had
an
unpleasant
sensation
through
fronds
of
asparagus
fern
i
caught
the
eyes
of
gurnard
fixed
upon
me
as
though
something
had
drawn
his
attention
i
returned
his
glance
tried
to
make
his
face
out
it
had
nothing
distinctive
in
its
pallid
oval
nothing
that
one
could
seize
upon
but
it
gave
the
impression
of
never
having
seen
the
light
of
day
of
never
having
had
the
sun
upon
it
but
the
conviction
that
i
had
aroused
his
attention
disturbed
me
what
could
the
man
know
about
me
i
seemed
to
feel
his
glance
bore
through
the
irises
of
my
eyes
into
the
back
of
my
skull
the
feeling
was
almost
physical
it
was
as
if
some
incredibly
concentrant
reflector
had
been
turned
upon
me
then
the
eyelids
dropped
over
the
metallic
rings
beneath
them
miss
churchill
continued
to
explain
she
has
started
a
sort
of
des
causes
in
the
faubourg
saint
germain
she
was
recording
the
vagaries
of
my
aunt
the
duc
laughed
ah
yes
he
said
what
a
menagerie
carlists
and
orleanists
and
papal
blacks
i
wonder
she
has
not
held
a
bazaar
in
favour
of
your
white
rose
league
ah
yes
i
echoed
i
have
heard
that
she
was
mad
about
the
divine
right
of
kings
miss
churchill
rose
as
ladies
rise
at
the
end
of
a
dinner
i
followed
her
out
of
the
room
in
obedience
to
some
minute
signal
we
were
on
the
best
of
terms
we
two
she
mothered
me
as
she
mothered
everybody
not
beneath
contempt
or
above
a
certain
age
i
liked
her
immensely
the
masterful
absorbed
brown
lady
as
she
walked
up
the
stairs
she
said
in
half
apology
for
withdrawing
me
they
got
things
to
talk
about
why
yes
i
answered
i
suppose
the
railway
matter
has
to
be
settled
she
looked
at
me
fixedly
you
you
must
talk
she
warned
oh
i
answered
i
not
indiscreet
not
essentially
the
other
three
were
somewhat
tardy
in
making
their
appearance
i
had
a
sense
of
them
leaning
their
heads
together
over
the
edges
of
the
table
in
the
interim
a
rather
fierce
political
dowager
convoyed
two
blond
daughters
into
the
room
there
was
a
continual
coming
and
going
of
such
people
in
the
house
they
did
with
miss
churchill
social
business
of
some
kind
arranged
electoral
and
what
not
troubled
me
very
little
on
this
occasion
the
blond
daughters
were
types
of
the
sixties
survivals
the
type
that
unemotionally
inspected
albums
i
was
convoying
them
through
a
volume
of
views
of
switzerland
the
dowager
was
saying
to
miss
churchill
you
think
then
it
will
be
enough
if
we
have
when
the
door
opened
behind
my
back
i
looked
round
negligently
and
hastily
returned
to
the
consideration
of
a
shining
photograph
of
the
dent
du
midi
a
very
gracious
figure
of
a
girl
was
embracing
the
grim
miss
churchill
as
a
gracious
girl
should
virginally
salute
a
grim
veteran
ah
my
dear
miss
churchill
a
fluting
voice
filled
the
large
room
we
were
very
nearly
going
back
to
paris
without
once
coming
to
see
you
we
are
only
over
for
two
days
for
the
tenants
ball
and
so
my
aunt
but
surely
that
is
arthur
i
turned
eagerly
it
was
the
dimensionist
girl
she
continued
talking
to
miss
churchill
we
meet
so
seldom
and
we
are
never
upon
terms
she
said
lightly
i
assure
you
we
are
like
cat
and
dog
she
came
toward
me
and
the
blond
maidens
disappeared
everybody
everything
disappeared
i
had
not
seen
her
for
nearly
a
year
i
had
vaguely
gathered
from
miss
churchill
that
she
was
regarded
as
a
sister
of
mine
that
she
had
with
wealth
inherited
from
a
australian
uncle
revived
the
glories
of
my
aunt
house
i
had
never
denied
it
because
i
did
not
want
to
interfere
with
my
aunt
attempts
to
regain
some
of
the
prosperity
it
even
had
my
sympathy
to
a
small
extent
for
after
all
the
family
was
my
family
too
as
a
memory
my
had
been
something
bright
and
and
rather
small
seen
now
she
was
something
that
one
could
not
look
at
for
glow
she
moved
toward
me
smiling
and
radiant
as
a
ship
moves
beneath
towers
of
shining
canvas
i
was
simply
overwhelmed
i
do
know
what
she
said
what
i
said
what
she
did
or
i
have
an
idea
that
we
conversed
for
some
minutes
i
remember
that
she
said
at
some
point
go
away
now
i
want
to
talk
to
mr
gurnard
as
a
matter
of
fact
gurnard
was
making
toward
her
a
deliberate
slow
progress
she
greeted
him
with
nonchalance
as
beneath
eyes
a
woman
greets
a
man
she
knows
intimately
i
found
myself
hating
him
thinking
that
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
she
ought
to
know
it
settled
she
asked
him
as
he
came
within
range
he
looked
at
me
inquiringly
insolently
she
said
my
brother
and
he
answered
oh
yes
as
i
moved
away
i
hated
the
man
and
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
off
him
and
her
i
went
and
stood
against
the
the
duc
de
mersch
bore
down
upon
them
and
i
welcomed
his
interruption
until
i
saw
that
he
too
was
intimate
with
her
intimate
with
a
pomposity
of
flourishes
as
irritating
as
gurnard
nonchalance
i
stood
there
and
glowered
at
them
i
noted
her
excessive
beauty
her
almost
perilous
while
she
stood
talking
to
those
two
men
of
me
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
eyes
i
had
no
mind
no
thoughts
i
saw
the
three
figures
go
through
the
attitudes
of
conversation
she
very
animated
de
mersch
grotesquely
gurnard
undisguisedly
saturnine
he
repelled
me
exactly
as
grossly
vulgar
men
had
the
power
of
doing
but
he
himself
was
not
that
there
was
something
something
i
could
not
quite
make
out
his
face
i
never
could
i
never
did
any
more
than
i
could
ever
quite
visualise
hers
i
wondered
vaguely
how
churchill
could
work
in
harness
with
such
a
man
how
he
could
bring
himself
to
be
closeted
as
he
had
just
been
with
him
and
with
a
fool
like
de
mersch
i
should
have
been
afraid
as
for
de
mersch
standing
between
those
two
he
seemed
like
a
country
lout
between
confederate
sharpers
it
struck
me
that
she
let
me
see
made
me
see
that
she
and
gurnard
had
an
understanding
made
manifest
to
me
by
glances
that
passed
when
the
duc
had
his
unobservant
eyes
turned
elsewhere
i
saw
churchill
in
turn
move
desultorily
toward
them
drawn
in
like
a
straw
toward
a
little
whirlpool
i
turned
my
back
in
a
fury
of
jealousy
chapter
nine
i
had
a
pretty
bad
night
after
that
and
was
not
much
in
the
mood
for
fox
on
the
morrow
the
sight
of
her
had
dwarfed
everything
the
thought
of
her
disgusted
me
with
everything
made
me
out
of
conceit
with
the
world
with
that
part
of
the
world
that
had
become
my
world
i
wanted
to
get
up
into
hers
and
i
could
not
see
any
way
the
room
in
which
fox
sat
seemed
to
be
hopelessly
off
the
road
to
be
hopelessly
off
any
road
to
any
place
to
be
the
end
of
a
blind
alley
one
day
i
might
hope
to
occupy
such
a
room
in
my
like
fox
but
that
was
not
the
end
of
my
career
not
the
end
that
i
desired
she
had
upset
me
you
just
missed
polehampton
fox
said
wanted
to
get
hold
of
your
oh
damn
polehampton
i
said
and
particularly
damn
the
willingly
fox
said
but
i
told
that
you
were
willing
if
i
do
want
to
know
i
repeated
i
tell
you
i
sick
of
the
things
what
a
change
he
asserted
sympathetically
i
you
would
it
struck
me
as
disgusting
that
a
person
like
fox
should
think
about
me
at
all
oh
i
see
it
through
i
said
who
the
next
we
got
to
have
the
duc
de
mersch
now
he
answered
de
mersch
as
state
founder
written
as
large
as
you
can
all
across
the
page
the
moment
come
and
we
got
to
rope
it
in
that
all
i
been
middling
good
to
you
you
understand
he
began
to
explain
in
his
dark
sentences
the
time
had
come
for
an
energetically
engineered
boom
in
de
mersch
a
boom
all
along
the
line
and
i
was
to
commence
the
campaign
fox
had
been
good
to
me
and
i
was
to
repay
him
i
listened
in
a
sort
of
apathetic
indifference
oh
very
well
i
said
i
was
subconsciously
aware
that
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
determining
factor
of
the
situation
was
the
announcement
that
de
mersch
was
to
be
in
paris
if
he
had
been
in
his
own
particular
grand
duchy
i
would
have
gone
after
him
for
a
moment
i
thought
of
the
interview
as
taking
place
in
london
but
fox
ostensibly
at
least
was
even
aware
of
de
mersch
visit
spoke
of
him
as
being
in
paris
in
a
flat
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
interview
the
continental
financiers
who
took
up
so
much
of
his
time
i
realised
that
i
wanted
to
go
to
paris
because
she
was
there
she
had
said
that
she
was
going
to
paris
on
the
morrow
of
yesterday
the
name
was
pleasant
to
me
and
it
turned
the
scale
fox
eyes
remained
upon
my
face
do
you
good
eh
he
dimly
interpreted
my
thoughts
a
run
over
i
thought
you
like
it
and
look
here
polehampton
taken
over
the
wants
to
get
new
blood
into
it
see
he
take
something
i
been
talking
to
him
a
short
series
that
sort
of
thing
i
tried
to
work
myself
into
some
sort
of
enthusiasm
of
gratitude
i
knew
that
fox
had
spoken
well
of
me
to
polehampton
as
a
sort
of
set
off
you
go
and
see
he
confirmed
it
really
all
arranged
and
then
get
off
to
paris
as
fast
as
you
can
and
have
a
good
time
have
i
been
unusually
cranky
lately
i
asked
oh
you
been
a
little
off
the
hooks
i
thought
for
the
last
week
or
so
he
took
up
a
large
bottle
of
white
mucilage
and
i
accepted
it
as
a
sign
of
dismissal
i
was
touched
by
his
solicitude
for
my
health
it
always
did
touch
me
and
i
found
myself
unusually
in
thought
as
i
went
down
the
front
steps
into
the
streets
for
all
his
frank
vulgarity
for
all
his
i
somehow
regarded
that
habit
of
his
as
the
final
mark
of
the
beast
and
the
louis
quinze
accessories
i
felt
a
warm
for
the
little
man
i
made
haste
to
see
polehampton
to
beard
him
in
a
sort
of
den
that
contained
a
number
of
shelves
of
books
selected
for
their
glittering
back
decoration
they
gave
the
impression
that
polehampton
wished
to
suggest
to
his
visitors
the
fitness
and
propriety
of
clothing
their
walls
with
the
same
gilt
cloth
they
gave
that
idea
but
i
think
that
actually
polehampton
took
an
aesthetic
delight
in
the
gilding
he
was
not
a
publisher
by
nature
he
had
drifted
into
the
trade
and
success
but
beneath
a
polish
of
acquaintance
retained
a
fine
awe
for
a
book
as
such
in
early
life
he
had
had
such
shining
things
on
a
shiny
table
in
a
parlour
he
had
a
similar
awe
for
his
daughter
who
had
been
born
after
his
entry
into
the
trade
and
who
had
the
literary
flavour
a
flavour
so
pronounced
that
he
dragged
her
by
the
heels
into
any
conversation
with
us
who
hewed
his
raw
material
expecting
i
suppose
to
cow
us
for
the
greater
good
of
this
young
lady
he
had
bought
the
one
of
the
portentous
political
organs
he
had
they
said
ideas
of
forcing
a
seat
out
of
the
party
as
a
recompense
it
did
matter
much
what
was
the
nature
of
my
series
of
articles
i
was
to
get
the
atmosphere
of
cities
as
i
had
got
those
of
the
various
individuals
i
seemed
to
pay
on
those
lines
and
miss
polehampton
commended
me
my
daughter
likes
eh
your
touch
you
know
and
his
terms
were
decent
for
the
man
and
were
offered
with
a
flourish
that
indicated
special
benevolence
and
a
reference
to
the
hundred
pounds
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
his
manner
until
he
began
to
stammer
out
an
indication
its
lines
were
that
i
knew
fox
and
i
knew
churchill
and
the
duc
de
mersch
and
the
and
those
financial
articles
in
the
were
they
now
they
was
the
trans
railway
actually
did
i
think
it
would
be
worth
while
in
fact
and
so
on
i
never
was
any
good
in
a
situation
of
that
sort
never
any
good
at
all
i
ought
to
have
assumed
blank
ignorance
but
the
man
eyes
pleaded
it
seemed
a
tremendous
matter
to
him
i
tried
to
be
and
said
of
course
i
have
any
right
but
i
had
a
vague
stupid
sense
that
loyalty
to
churchill
demanded
that
i
should
back
up
a
man
he
was
backing
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
so
direct
was
it
have
been
it
was
something
about
shares
in
one
of
de
mersch
other
enterprises
polehampton
was
going
to
pick
them
up
for
nothing
and
they
were
going
to
rise
when
the
boom
in
de
mersch
began
something
of
the
sort
and
the
boom
would
begin
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
agreement
about
the
railway
got
abroad
i
let
him
get
it
out
of
me
in
a
way
that
makes
the
thought
of
that
bare
place
with
its
gilt
and
its
three
uncomfortable
and
the
windows
through
which
one
read
the
inversion
of
the
legend
polehampton
all
its
gloom
and
its
rigid
lines
and
its
pallid
light
a
memory
of
confusion
and
polehampton
was
properly
grateful
and
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
and
his
phantasmal
daughter
who
wanted
to
make
my
acquaintance
it
was
like
a
command
to
a
state
banquet
given
by
a
palace
official
and
lea
would
be
invited
to
meet
me
miss
polehampton
did
not
like
lea
but
he
had
to
be
asked
once
a
year
to
encourage
good
feeling
i
suppose
the
interview
dribbled
out
on
those
lines
i
asked
if
it
was
one
of
lea
days
at
the
office
it
was
not
i
tried
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
lea
but
it
was
not
very
effective
polehampton
was
too
subject
to
his
assistant
thorns
to
be
responsive
to
praise
of
him
so
i
hurried
out
of
the
place
i
wanted
to
be
out
of
this
medium
in
which
my
ineffectiveness
threatened
to
proclaim
itself
to
me
it
was
not
a
very
difficult
matter
i
had
in
those
days
rooms
in
one
of
the
political
journalists
clubs
a
vast
mausoleum
of
white
tiles
but
a
man
used
to
pack
my
portmanteau
very
efficiently
and
at
short
notice
at
the
station
one
of
those
coincidences
that
are
not
coincidences
made
me
run
against
the
great
callan
he
was
rather
unhappy
found
it
impossible
to
make
an
already
distracted
porter
listen
to
the
end
of
one
of
his
sentences
with
waits
between
each
word
for
that
reason
he
brightened
to
see
me
was
delighted
to
find
a
companion
who
would
take
him
on
terms
of
greatness
in
the
railway
carriage
divested
of
troublesome
bags
that
imparted
anxiety
to
his
small
face
and
a
stagger
to
his
walk
he
swelled
to
his
normal
dimensions
so
you
going
to
paris
he
meditated
for
the
i
going
to
paris
for
the
i
agreed
ah
he
went
on
you
going
to
interview
the
elective
grand
duke
we
call
him
the
duc
de
mersch
i
interrupted
flippantly
it
was
a
matter
of
nuances
the
elective
grand
duke
was
a
philanthropist
and
a
state
founder
the
duc
de
mersch
was
the
hero
as
financier
of
callan
ignored
the
titles
slipped
over
his
tongue
like
the
last
drops
of
some
inestimable
oily
vintage
i
might
have
saved
you
the
trouble
i
going
to
see
him
myself
i
italicised
it
struck
me
as
phenomenal
and
rather
absurd
that
everybody
that
i
came
across
should
in
some
way
or
other
be
mixed
up
with
this
portentous
philanthropist
it
was
as
if
a
fisherman
were
drawing
in
a
ground
line
baited
with
hundreds
of
hooks
he
had
a
little
offended
air
he
or
i
should
say
a
number
of
people
interested
in
a
philanthropic
society
have
asked
me
to
go
to
greenland
do
they
want
to
get
rid
of
you
i
asked
flippantly
i
was
made
to
know
my
place
my
dear
fellow
callan
said
in
his
most
deliberate
most
olympian
tone
i
believe
you
entirely
mistaken
i
believe
i
been
informed
that
the
système
groënlandais
is
one
of
the
healthiest
places
in
the
polar
regions
there
are
interested
persons
who
so
i
heard
i
interrupted
but
i
can
assure
you
i
heard
nothing
but
good
of
the
système
and
the
and
its
philanthropists
i
meant
nothing
against
them
i
was
only
astonished
that
you
should
go
to
such
a
place
i
have
been
asked
to
go
upon
a
mission
he
explained
seriously
to
ascertain
what
the
truth
about
the
système
really
is
it
is
a
new
country
with
i
am
assured
a
great
future
in
store
a
great
deal
of
english
money
has
been
invested
in
its
securities
and
naturally
great
interest
is
taken
in
its
affairs
so
it
seems
i
said
i
seem
to
run
upon
it
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
ah
yes
callan
rhapsodised
it
has
a
great
future
in
store
a
great
future
the
duke
is
a
true
philanthropist
he
has
taken
infinite
pains
infinite
pains
he
wished
to
build
up
a
model
state
model
protectorate
of
the
world
a
place
where
perfect
equality
shall
obtain
for
all
races
all
creeds
and
all
colours
you
would
scarcely
believe
how
he
has
worked
to
ensure
the
happiness
of
the
native
races
he
founded
the
great
society
to
protect
the
esquimaux
the
society
for
the
regeneration
of
the
arctic
regions
the
as
you
called
it
and
now
he
is
only
waiting
to
accomplish
his
greatest
project
the
railway
when
that
is
done
he
will
hand
over
the
système
to
his
own
people
that
is
the
act
of
a
great
man
ah
yes
i
said
well
callan
began
again
but
suddenly
paused
this
must
go
no
farther
he
said
anxiously
i
will
let
you
have
full
particulars
when
the
time
is
ripe
my
dear
callan
i
said
touchily
i
can
hold
my
tongue
he
went
off
at
tangent
i
do
want
you
to
take
my
word
i
have
seen
it
yet
but
i
feel
assured
about
it
myself
the
most
distinguished
people
have
spoken
to
me
in
its
favour
the
celebrated
traveller
aston
spoke
of
it
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
was
the
first
you
know
of
course
i
should
not
take
any
interest
in
it
if
i
were
not
satisfied
as
to
that
it
is
percisely
because
i
feel
that
the
thing
is
one
of
the
finest
monuments
of
a
grand
century
that
i
am
going
to
lend
it
the
weight
of
my
pen
i
quite
understand
i
assured
him
then
solicitously
i
hope
they
do
expect
you
to
do
it
for
nothing
oh
dear
no
callan
answered
ah
well
i
wish
you
luck
i
said
they
could
have
got
a
better
man
to
win
over
the
national
conscience
i
suppose
it
comes
to
that
callan
nodded
i
fancy
i
have
the
ear
of
the
public
he
said
he
seemed
to
get
satisfaction
from
the
thought
the
train
entered
folkestone
harbour
the
smell
of
the
sea
and
the
easy
send
of
the
boat
put
a
little
heart
into
me
but
my
spirits
were
on
the
down
grade
callan
was
a
trying
companion
the
sight
of
him
stirred
uneasy
emotions
the
sound
of
his
voice
jarred
are
you
coming
to
the
grand
he
said
as
we
passed
denis
my
god
no
i
answered
hotly
i
going
across
the
river
ah
he
murmured
the
quartier
latin
i
wish
i
could
come
with
you
but
i
my
reputation
to
think
of
you
be
surprised
how
people
get
to
hear
of
my
movements
besides
i
a
family
man
i
was
agitatedly
silent
the
train
steamed
into
the
glare
of
the
electric
lights
and
getting
into
a
fiacre
i
breathed
again
i
seemed
to
be
at
the
entrance
of
a
new
life
a
better
sort
of
paradise
during
that
drive
across
the
night
city
in
london
one
is
always
a
passenger
in
paris
one
has
reached
a
goal
the
crowds
on
the
pavements
under
the
in
the
black
shadows
in
the
white
glare
of
the
open
spaces
are
at
leisure
they
go
nowhere
seek
nothing
beyond
we
crossed
the
river
the
unwinking
towers
of
notre
dame
towering
pallidly
against
the
dark
sky
behind
us
rattled
into
the
new
light
of
the
resuming
boulevard
turned
up
a
dark
street
and
came
to
a
halt
before
a
shut
door
you
know
how
one
wakes
the
sleepy
concierge
how
one
takes
one
candle
climbs
up
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
smooth
stairs
following
the
slipshod
footfalls
of
a
guide
upward
through
rembrandt
own
shadows
and
how
one
final
sleep
is
sweetened
by
the
little
inconveniences
of
a
strange
bare
room
and
of
a
strange
hard
bed
chapter
ten
before
noon
of
the
next
day
i
was
ascending
the
stairs
of
the
new
house
in
which
the
duc
had
his
hermitage
there
was
an
air
of
secrecy
in
the
broad
publicity
of
the
carpeted
stairs
that
led
to
his
flat
a
hush
in
the
atmosphere
in
the
street
itself
a
glorified
de
that
ran
into
the
bustling
life
of
the
italiens
it
had
the
sudden
sluggishness
of
a
one
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
deaf
in
the
midst
of
the
rattle
there
was
an
incredible
suggestion
of
silence
the
silence
of
a
private
detective
in
the
mien
of
the
servant
who
ushered
me
into
a
room
he
was
the
english
servant
of
the
theatre
the
english
servant
that
foreigners
affect
the
room
had
a
splendour
of
its
own
not
a
cheaply
vulgar
splendour
but
the
vulgarity
of
the
most
lavish
plush
and
purple
kind
the
air
was
heavy
killed
by
the
scent
of
exotic
flowers
darkened
by
curtains
that
suggested
the
voluminous
velvet
backgrounds
of
certain
old
portraits
the
duc
de
mersch
had
carried
with
him
into
this
place
of
retirement
the
taste
of
the
new
palace
that
of
his
that
was
the
stupefaction
of
swarms
of
honest
tourists
i
remembered
soon
enough
that
the
man
was
a
philanthropist
that
he
might
be
an
excellent
man
of
heart
and
indifferent
of
taste
he
must
be
but
i
was
prone
to
be
influenced
by
things
of
this
sort
and
felt
depressed
at
the
thought
that
so
much
of
royal
excellence
should
weigh
so
heavily
in
the
wrong
scale
of
the
balance
of
the
applied
arts
i
turned
my
back
on
the
room
and
gazed
at
the
blazing
white
decorations
of
the
opposite
a
door
behind
me
must
have
opened
for
i
heard
the
sounds
of
a
concluding
tirade
in
a
voice
quant
à
un
duc
de
farce
je
ne
fiche
pas
mal
it
said
in
an
accent
curiously
compounded
of
the
foreign
and
the
a
muttered
male
remonstrance
ensued
and
then
with
disconcerting
clearness
eschingan
eh
bien
il
entend
et
moi
moi
aussi
tu
veux
me
jouer
contre
elle
la
grangeur
pah
avec
elle
mon
vieux
je
ne
veux
plus
de
toi
tu
donné
de
tes
sales
rentes
groenlandoises
et
je
pas
pu
les
vendre
ah
vieux
farceur
tu
vas
voir
ce
que
vais
a
glorious
creature
a
really
glorious
creature
came
out
of
an
adjoining
room
she
was
as
frail
as
swaying
as
a
garden
lily
her
great
blue
eyes
turned
irefully
upon
me
her
bowed
lips
parted
her
nostrils
quivered
quant
à
vous
grangeur
eschingan
she
began
vais
vous
donner
mon
idée
à
moi
i
did
not
understand
the
situation
in
the
least
but
i
appreciated
the
awkwardness
of
it
the
world
seemed
to
be
standing
on
its
head
i
was
overcome
but
i
felt
for
the
person
in
the
next
room
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
suddenly
i
found
myself
saying
i
am
extremely
sorry
madam
but
i
do
understand
french
an
expression
of
more
intense
vexation
passed
into
her
face
her
beautiful
face
i
fancy
she
wished
wished
intensely
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
her
à
she
made
a
quick
violent
gesture
of
disgusted
contempt
and
turned
toward
the
door
from
which
she
had
come
she
began
again
to
dilate
upon
the
little
weaknesses
of
the
person
behind
when
silently
and
swiftly
it
closed
we
heard
the
lock
click
with
extraordinary
quickness
she
had
her
mouth
at
the
keyhole
she
enunciated
then
she
stood
to
her
full
height
her
face
became
calm
her
manner
stately
she
glided
half
way
across
the
room
paused
looked
at
me
and
pointed
toward
the
unmoving
door
she
explained
mysteriously
i
think
she
was
warning
me
against
the
wiles
of
the
person
behind
the
door
i
gazed
into
her
great
eyes
i
understand
i
said
gravely
she
glided
from
the
room
for
me
the
incident
supplied
a
welcome
touch
of
comedy
i
had
leisure
for
thought
the
door
remained
closed
it
made
the
duc
a
more
real
person
for
me
i
had
regarded
him
as
a
rather
tiresome
person
in
whom
a
pompous
philanthropism
took
the
place
of
human
feelings
it
amused
me
to
be
called
it
amused
me
and
i
stood
in
need
of
amusement
without
it
i
might
never
have
written
the
article
on
the
duc
i
had
started
out
that
morning
in
a
state
of
nervous
irritation
i
had
wanted
more
than
ever
to
have
done
with
the
thing
with
the
with
journalism
with
everything
but
this
little
new
experience
buoyed
me
up
set
my
mind
working
in
less
morbid
lines
i
began
to
wonder
whether
de
mersch
would
funk
or
whether
he
would
take
my
of
the
woman
tirades
as
a
thing
assured
the
door
at
which
i
had
entered
by
which
she
had
left
opened
he
must
have
impressed
me
in
some
way
or
other
that
evening
at
the
churchills
he
seemed
a
very
stereotyped
image
in
my
memory
he
spoke
just
as
he
had
spoken
moved
his
hands
just
as
i
expected
him
to
move
them
he
called
for
no
modification
of
my
views
of
his
person
as
a
rule
one
classes
a
man
at
first
meeting
modifies
the
classification
at
each
subsequent
one
and
so
on
he
seemed
to
be
all
affability
of
an
adipose
turn
he
had
the
air
of
the
man
of
the
world
among
men
of
the
world
but
none
of
the
unconscious
reserve
of
manner
that
one
expects
to
find
in
the
temporarily
great
he
had
in
its
place
a
kind
of
as
if
he
regretted
the
pedestal
from
which
he
had
descended
in
his
slow
commercial
english
he
apologised
for
having
kept
me
waiting
he
had
been
taking
the
air
of
this
fine
morning
he
said
he
mumbled
the
words
with
his
eyes
on
my
waistcoat
with
an
air
that
accorded
rather
ill
with
the
semblance
of
portentous
probity
that
his
beard
conferred
on
him
but
he
set
an
in
his
left
eye
immediately
afterward
and
looked
straight
at
me
as
if
in
challenge
with
a
smiling
do
mention
i
tried
to
demonstrate
that
i
met
him
half
way
you
want
to
interview
me
he
said
blandly
i
am
only
too
pleased
i
suppose
it
is
about
my
arctic
schemes
that
you
wish
to
know
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
inform
you
you
perhaps
remember
what
i
said
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
at
the
house
of
the
right
honourable
churchill
it
has
been
the
dream
of
my
life
to
leave
behind
me
a
happy
and
contented
state
as
much
as
laws
and
organisation
can
make
one
this
is
what
i
should
most
like
the
english
to
know
of
me
he
was
a
dull
talker
i
supposed
that
philanthropists
and
state
founders
kept
their
best
faculties
for
their
higher
pursuits
i
imagined
the
low
receding
forehead
and
the
fleshy
hands
to
belong
to
a
new
solon
a
æneas
i
tried
to
work
myself
into
the
properly
enthusiastic
frame
of
mind
after
all
it
was
a
great
work
that
he
had
undertaken
i
was
too
much
given
to
dwell
upon
intellectual
gifts
these
the
duc
seemed
to
lack
i
credited
him
with
having
let
them
be
merged
in
his
one
noble
idea
he
furnished
me
with
statistics
they
had
laid
down
so
many
miles
of
railways
used
so
many
engines
of
british
construction
they
had
taught
the
natives
to
use
and
to
value
and
european
costumes
so
many
hundred
of
english
younger
sons
had
gone
to
make
their
fortunes
and
incidentally
to
enlighten
the
esquimaux
so
many
hundreds
of
french
of
germans
greeks
russians
all
these
lived
and
moved
in
harmony
employed
happy
free
labourers
protected
by
the
most
rigid
laws
slavery
had
been
abolished
stamped
out
the
great
international
society
for
the
preservation
of
polar
freedom
watched
over
all
suggested
new
laws
modified
the
old
the
country
was
unhealthy
but
not
to
men
of
clean
lives
bonæ
it
asked
for
no
others
i
have
had
to
endure
much
misrepresentation
i
have
been
called
names
the
duc
said
the
figure
of
the
lady
danced
before
my
eyes
lithe
supple
a
statue
endued
with
the
motion
of
a
serpent
i
seemed
to
see
her
sculptured
white
hand
pointing
to
the
closed
door
ah
yes
i
said
but
one
knows
the
people
that
call
you
names
well
then
he
answered
it
is
your
task
to
make
them
know
the
truth
your
nation
has
so
much
power
if
it
will
only
realise
i
will
do
my
best
i
said
i
saw
the
apotheosis
of
the
press
a
press
that
makes
a
state
founder
suppliant
to
a
man
like
myself
for
he
had
the
tone
of
a
deprecating
petitioner
i
stood
between
himself
and
a
people
the
arbiter
of
the
peoples
of
the
kings
of
the
future
i
was
nothing
nobody
yet
here
i
stood
in
communion
with
one
of
those
who
change
the
face
of
continents
he
had
need
of
me
of
the
power
that
was
behind
me
it
was
strange
to
be
alone
in
that
room
with
that
man
to
be
there
just
as
i
might
be
in
my
own
little
room
alone
with
any
other
man
i
was
not
unduly
elated
you
must
understand
it
was
nothing
to
me
i
was
just
a
person
elected
by
some
suffrage
of
accidents
even
in
my
own
eyes
i
was
merely
a
symbol
the
sign
visible
of
incomprehensible
power
i
will
do
my
best
i
said
ah
yes
do
he
said
churchill
told
me
how
nicely
you
can
do
such
things
i
said
that
it
was
very
kind
of
churchill
the
tension
of
the
conversation
was
relaxed
the
duc
asked
if
i
had
yet
seen
my
aunt
i
had
forgotten
her
i
said
oh
you
must
see
her
he
said
she
is
a
most
remarkable
lady
she
is
one
of
my
relaxations
all
paris
talks
about
her
i
can
assure
you
i
had
no
idea
i
said
oh
cultivate
her
he
said
you
will
be
amused
i
will
i
said
as
i
took
my
leave
i
went
straight
home
to
my
little
room
above
the
roofs
i
began
at
once
to
write
my
article
working
at
high
pressure
almost
hysterically
i
remember
that
place
and
that
time
so
well
in
moments
of
emotion
one
gazes
fixedly
at
things
hardly
conscious
of
them
afterward
one
remembers
i
can
still
see
the
narrow
room
the
bare
brown
discoloured
walls
the
incongruous
marble
clock
on
the
the
single
rickety
chair
that
swayed
beneath
me
i
could
almost
draw
the
tortuous
pattern
of
the
faded
cloth
that
hid
the
round
table
at
which
i
sat
the
ink
was
thick
pale
and
sticky
the
pen
spluttered
i
wrote
furiously
anxious
to
be
done
with
it
once
i
went
and
leaned
over
the
balcony
trying
to
hit
on
a
word
that
would
not
come
miles
down
below
little
people
crawled
over
the
cobbled
street
little
carts
rattled
little
workmen
let
down
casks
into
a
cellar
it
was
all
very
grey
small
and
clear
through
the
open
window
of
an
opposite
garret
i
could
see
a
sculptor
working
at
a
colossal
clay
model
in
his
white
blouse
he
seemed
big
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
world
level
with
my
eyes
there
were
flat
lead
roofs
and
chimneys
on
one
of
these
was
scrawled
in
big
irregular
letters
bas
great
clouds
began
to
loom
into
view
over
the
rounded
toppling
masses
of
grey
lit
up
with
sullen
orange
against
the
pale
limpid
blue
of
the
sky
i
stood
and
looked
at
all
these
objects
i
had
come
out
here
to
think
thoughts
had
deserted
me
i
could
only
look
the
clouds
moved
imperceptibly
fatefully
onward
a
streak
of
lightning
tore
them
apart
they
whirled
like
tortured
smoke
and
grew
suddenly
black
large
spots
of
rain
with
jagged
edges
began
to
fall
on
the
lead
floor
of
my
balcony
i
turned
into
the
twilight
of
my
room
and
began
to
write
i
can
still
feel
the
tearing
of
my
on
the
coarse
paper
it
was
a
hindrance
to
thought
but
my
flow
of
words
ignored
it
gained
impetus
from
it
as
a
stream
does
at
the
breaking
of
a
dam
i
was
writing
a
pæan
to
a
great
coloniser
that
sort
of
thing
was
in
the
air
then
i
was
drawn
into
it
carried
away
by
my
subject
perhaps
i
let
it
do
so
because
it
was
so
little
familiar
to
my
lines
of
thought
it
was
fresh
ground
and
i
revelled
in
it
i
committed
myself
to
that
kind
of
emotional
lyrical
outburst
that
one
dislikes
so
much
on
i
was
half
conscious
of
the
fact
but
i
ignored
it
the
thunderstorm
was
over
and
there
was
a
moist
sparkling
freshness
in
the
air
when
i
hurried
with
my
copy
to
the
office
in
the
avenue
de
i
wished
to
be
rid
of
it
to
render
impossible
all
chance
of
revision
on
the
morrow
i
wanted
too
to
feel
elated
i
expected
it
it
was
a
right
at
the
office
i
found
the
foreign
correspondent
a
little
cosmopolitan
jew
whose
eyebrows
began
their
growth
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
he
was
effusive
and
familiar
as
the
rest
of
his
kind
hullo
granger
was
his
greeting
i
was
used
to
regarding
myself
as
fallen
from
a
high
estate
but
i
was
not
yet
so
humble
in
spirit
as
to
relish
being
called
granger
by
a
stranger
of
his
stamp
i
tried
to
freeze
him
politely
read
your
stuff
in
the
was
his
rejoinder
jolly
good
i
call
it
been
doing
old
let
have
a
look
yes
yes
that
the
way
that
the
real
thing
i
call
it
must
have
bored
you
to
death
old
de
mersch
i
mean
i
ought
to
have
had
the
job
you
know
my
business
interviewing
people
in
paris
but
do
mind
much
rather
you
did
it
than
i
you
do
it
a
heap
better
i
murmured
thanks
there
was
a
pathos
about
the
sleek
little
man
a
pathos
that
is
always
present
in
the
type
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
assume
a
deprecating
equality
where
are
you
going
he
asked
with
sudden
effusiveness
i
was
taken
aback
one
is
not
used
to
being
asked
these
questions
after
five
minutes
acquaintance
i
said
that
i
had
no
plans
look
here
he
said
brightening
up
come
and
have
dinner
with
me
at
breguet
and
look
in
at
the
opera
afterward
we
have
a
real
nice
chat
i
was
too
tired
to
frame
an
adequate
excuse
besides
the
little
man
was
as
eager
as
a
child
for
a
new
toy
we
went
to
breguet
and
had
a
really
excellent
dinner
always
come
here
he
said
one
meets
a
lot
of
swells
it
runs
away
with
a
deal
of
money
but
i
do
care
to
do
things
on
the
cheap
not
for
the
you
know
you
can
always
be
certain
when
i
say
that
i
have
a
thing
from
a
senator
that
he
is
a
senator
and
not
an
old
woman
in
a
paper
kiosque
most
of
them
do
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
i
always
wondered
i
said
mildly
that
de
sourdam
i
nodded
to
as
we
came
in
and
that
old
chap
there
is
pluyvis
the
affaire
man
you
know
i
must
have
a
word
with
him
in
a
minute
if
you
excuse
me
he
began
to
ask
affectionately
after
the
health
of
the
excellent
fox
asked
if
i
saw
him
often
and
so
on
and
so
on
i
divined
with
amusement
that
was
pleasurable
that
the
little
man
had
his
own
little
axe
to
grind
and
thought
i
might
take
a
turn
at
the
grindstone
if
he
managed
me
well
so
he
nodded
to
de
sourdam
of
the
austrian
embassy
and
had
his
word
with
pluyvis
and
rejoiced
to
have
impressed
me
i
could
see
him
bubble
with
happiness
and
purr
he
proposed
that
we
should
stroll
as
far
as
the
paper
kiosque
that
he
patronised
habitually
it
was
kept
by
a
a
snuffy
little
old
woman
i
understood
that
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
he
was
for
expanding
for
wasting
a
few
minutes
on
a
stroll
have
stretched
my
legs
for
months
he
explained
we
strolled
there
through
the
summer
twilight
it
was
so
pleasant
to
saunter
through
the
young
summer
night
there
were
so
many
little
things
to
catch
the
eyes
so
many
of
the
little
things
down
near
the
earth
expressions
on
faces
of
the
passers
the
set
of
a
collar
the
quaint
foreign
tightness
of
waist
of
a
good
bourgeoise
who
walked
arm
in
arm
with
her
perspiring
spouse
the
gilding
on
the
statue
of
joan
of
arc
had
a
pleasant
littleness
of
philistinism
the
arcades
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
broke
up
the
grey
light
pleasantly
too
i
remembered
a
little
shop
a
little
greek
affair
with
a
windowful
of
where
i
had
been
given
a
false
piece
years
and
years
ago
the
same
villainous
old
levantine
stood
in
the
doorway
perhaps
the
fez
that
he
wore
was
the
same
fez
the
little
old
woman
that
we
strolled
to
was
bent
nearly
double
her
nose
touched
her
wares
as
often
as
not
her
mittened
hands
sought
quiveringly
the
papers
that
the
correspondent
asked
for
i
liked
him
the
better
for
his
solicitude
for
this
forlorn
piece
of
flotsam
of
his
own
race
always
come
here
he
exclaimed
one
gets
into
habits
very
honest
woman
too
you
can
be
certain
of
getting
your
change
if
you
a
stranger
you
ca
be
sure
that
they
wo
give
you
italian
silver
you
know
oh
i
know
i
answered
i
knew
too
that
he
wished
me
to
purchase
something
i
followed
the
course
of
her
groping
hands
caught
sight
of
the
and
remembered
that
it
contained
something
about
greenland
i
helped
myself
to
it
paid
for
it
and
received
my
just
change
i
felt
that
i
had
satisfied
the
little
man
and
felt
satisfied
with
myself
i
want
to
see
radet
article
on
greenland
i
said
oh
yes
he
explained
once
more
exhibiting
himself
in
the
capacity
of
the
man
who
knows
radet
gives
it
to
them
rather
a
lark
i
call
it
though
you
must
let
old
de
mersch
know
you
read
him
radet
got
sick
of
cochin
and
tried
greenland
he
getting
touched
by
the
whites
you
know
they
say
that
the
priests
do
like
the
way
the
système
playing
into
the
hands
of
the
protestants
and
the
english
government
so
they
set
radet
on
to
write
it
down
he
going
in
for
mysticism
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
just
like
all
these
french
jokers
are
doing
got
deuced
thick
with
that
lot
in
the
germain
some
relation
of
yours
ai
they
rather
a
lark
that
lot
quite
the
thing
just
now
everyone
goes
there
old
de
mersch
too
have
frightful
rows
sometimes
such
a
mixed
lot
you
see
the
good
little
man
rattled
amiably
along
beside
me
seems
quite
funny
to
be
buying
books
he
said
i
have
read
a
thing
i
bought
not
for
years
we
reached
the
opera
in
time
for
the
end
of
the
first
act
it
was
aïda
i
think
my
little
friend
had
a
free
pass
all
over
the
house
i
had
not
been
in
it
for
years
in
the
old
days
i
had
always
seen
the
stage
from
a
great
height
craning
over
people
heads
in
a
sultry
twilight
now
i
saw
it
on
a
level
seated
at
my
ease
i
had
only
the
power
of
the
press
to
thank
for
the
change
come
here
as
often
as
i
can
my
companion
said
ca
do
without
music
when
it
to
be
had
indeed
he
had
the
love
of
his
race
for
it
it
seemed
to
soften
him
to
change
his
nature
as
he
sat
silent
by
my
side
but
the
closing
notes
of
each
scene
found
him
out
in
the
cool
of
the
corridors
talking
and
being
talked
to
by
anyone
that
would
vouchsafe
him
a
word
pick
up
a
lot
here
he
explained
after
the
finale
we
leaned
over
one
of
the
side
balconies
to
watch
the
crowd
streaming
down
the
marble
staircases
it
is
a
scene
that
i
never
tire
of
there
is
something
so
fantastically
tawdry
in
the
coloured
marble
of
the
architecture
it
is
for
all
the
world
like
a
triumph
of
ornamental
soap
work
one
expects
to
smell
the
odours
and
the
torrent
of
humanity
pouring
liquidly
aslant
through
the
light
and
the
spaciousness
yes
it
is
fantastic
somehow
ironical
too
i
was
watching
the
devious
passage
of
a
rather
drunken
gigantic
florid
englishman
wondering
i
think
how
he
would
reach
his
bed
that
must
be
a
relation
of
yours
the
correspondent
said
pointing
my
glance
followed
the
line
indicated
by
his
pale
finger
i
made
out
the
glorious
beard
of
the
duc
de
mersch
on
his
arm
was
an
old
lady
to
whom
he
seemed
to
pay
deferential
attention
his
head
was
bent
on
one
side
he
was
smiling
frankly
a
little
behind
them
on
the
stairway
there
was
a
space
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
perhaps
there
was
no
space
i
know
i
was
only
conscious
of
a
figure
an
indescribably
woman
figure
gliding
down
the
way
it
had
a
coldness
a
a
motion
of
its
own
in
that
clear
transparent
shimmering
light
every
little
fold
of
the
dress
every
little
shadow
of
the
white
arms
the
white
shoulders
came
up
to
me
the
face
turned
up
to
meet
mine
i
remember
so
well
the
light
shining
down
on
the
face
not
a
shadow
anywhere
not
a
shadow
beneath
the
eyebrows
the
nostrils
the
waves
of
hair
it
was
a
vision
of
light
theatening
sinister
she
smiled
her
lips
parted
you
come
to
me
she
said
did
i
hear
the
words
did
her
lips
merely
form
them
she
was
far
far
down
below
me
the
air
was
alive
with
the
rustling
of
feet
of
garments
of
laughter
full
of
sounds
that
made
themselves
heard
full
of
sounds
that
would
not
be
caught
you
come
to
me
the
old
lady
on
the
duc
de
mersch
arm
was
obviously
my
aunt
i
did
not
see
why
i
should
not
go
to
them
it
struck
me
suddenly
and
rather
pleasantly
that
this
was
after
all
my
family
this
old
lady
actually
was
a
connection
more
close
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
as
for
the
girl
to
all
intents
and
in
everyone
else
eyes
she
was
my
sister
i
can
not
say
i
disliked
having
her
for
my
sister
either
i
stood
looking
down
upon
them
and
felt
less
alone
than
i
had
done
for
many
years
a
minute
scuffle
of
the
shortest
duration
was
taking
place
beside
me
there
were
a
couple
of
men
at
my
elbow
i
do
in
the
least
know
what
they
were
perhaps
marquises
perhaps
railway
employees
one
never
can
tell
over
there
one
of
them
was
tall
and
blond
with
a
heavy
red
moustache
irish
in
type
the
other
of
no
particular
height
excellently
groomed
dark
and
exemplary
i
knew
he
was
exemplary
from
some
detail
of
costume
that
i
ca
remember
his
gloves
or
a
strip
of
silk
down
the
sides
of
his
trousers
something
of
the
sort
the
blond
was
saying
something
that
i
did
not
catch
i
heard
the
words
de
mersch
and
and
saw
the
dark
man
turn
his
attention
to
the
little
group
below
then
i
caught
my
own
name
mispronounced
and
somewhat
of
a
to
a
contemptuous
intonation
the
little
correspondent
who
was
on
my
other
arm
started
visibly
and
moved
swiftly
behind
my
back
he
said
in
an
urgent
whisper
and
drew
them
to
a
little
distance
i
saw
him
say
something
saw
them
pivot
to
look
at
me
shrug
their
shoulders
and
walk
away
i
did
in
the
least
grasp
the
significance
of
the
scene
not
then
what
the
matter
i
asked
my
returning
friend
were
they
talking
about
me
he
answered
nervously
oh
it
was
about
your
aunt
salon
you
know
they
might
have
been
going
to
say
something
awkward
one
never
knows
they
really
talk
about
it
then
i
said
i
a
good
mind
to
attend
one
of
their
exhibitions
why
of
course
he
said
you
ought
i
really
think
you
i
go
i
answered
chapter
eleven
i
could
get
to
sleep
that
night
but
lay
and
tossed
lit
my
candle
and
read
and
so
on
for
ever
and
ever
for
an
eternity
i
was
confoundedly
excited
there
were
a
hundred
things
to
be
thought
about
clamouring
to
be
thought
about
the
chimes
of
some
near
clock
i
began
to
read
the
article
by
radet
in
the
the
one
i
had
bought
of
the
old
woman
in
the
kiosque
it
upset
me
a
good
deal
that
article
it
gave
away
the
whole
greenland
show
so
completely
that
the
ecstatic
bosh
i
had
just
despatched
to
the
seemed
impossible
i
suppose
the
good
radet
had
his
axe
to
grind
just
as
i
had
had
to
grind
the
state
founder
but
radet
axe
did
show
i
was
reading
about
an
inland
valley
a
broad
shadowy
grey
thing
immensely
broad
immensely
shadowy
winding
away
between
immense
mountains
into
the
silence
of
an
unknown
country
a
little
band
of
men
microscopic
figures
in
that
immensity
in
those
mists
crept
slowly
up
it
a
man
among
them
was
speaking
i
seemed
to
hear
his
voice
low
monotonous
overpowered
by
the
wan
light
and
the
silence
and
the
vastness
and
how
well
it
was
done
how
the
man
could
write
how
skilfully
he
made
his
points
there
was
no
slosh
about
it
no
sentiment
the
touch
was
light
in
places
even
gay
he
saw
so
well
the
romance
of
that
dun
band
that
had
cast
remorse
behind
that
had
no
return
no
future
that
spread
desolation
desolately
this
was
merely
a
review
article
a
thing
that
in
england
would
have
been
unreadable
the
narrative
of
a
nomad
of
some
genius
i
could
never
have
written
like
that
i
should
have
spoilt
it
somehow
it
set
me
tingling
with
desire
with
the
desire
that
transcends
the
sexual
the
desire
for
the
fine
phrase
for
the
right
word
for
all
the
other
intangibles
and
i
had
been
wasting
all
this
time
had
been
writing
my
inanities
i
must
go
away
must
get
back
right
back
to
the
old
road
must
work
there
was
so
little
time
it
was
unpleasant
too
to
have
been
mixed
up
in
this
affair
to
have
been
trepanned
into
doing
my
best
to
help
it
on
its
foul
way
god
knows
i
had
little
of
the
humanitarian
in
me
if
people
must
murder
in
the
of
an
immense
world
they
must
do
murder
and
pay
the
price
but
that
i
should
have
been
mixed
up
in
such
was
not
what
i
had
wanted
i
must
have
done
with
it
all
with
all
this
sort
of
thing
must
get
back
to
my
old
self
must
get
back
i
seemed
to
hear
the
slow
words
of
the
duc
de
mersch
we
have
increased
exports
by
so
much
the
imports
by
so
much
we
have
protected
the
natives
have
kept
their
higher
interests
ever
present
in
our
minds
and
through
it
all
we
have
never
forgotten
the
mission
entrusted
to
us
by
europe
to
remove
the
evil
of
darkness
from
the
earth
to
root
out
barbarism
with
its
nameless
horrors
whose
existence
has
been
a
blot
on
our
consciences
men
of
and
are
doing
it
now
are
laying
down
their
priceless
lives
to
root
out
to
root
our
of
course
they
rooting
them
out
it
did
matter
to
me
one
supposes
that
that
sort
of
native
exists
for
that
sort
of
thing
to
be
rooted
out
by
men
of
with
careers
to
make
the
point
was
that
that
was
what
they
were
really
doing
out
there
rooting
out
the
barbarians
as
well
as
the
barbarism
and
proving
themselves
worthy
of
their
hire
and
i
had
been
writing
them
up
and
was
no
better
than
the
farcical
governor
of
a
department
who
would
write
on
the
morrow
to
protest
that
that
was
what
they
did
not
do
you
see
i
had
a
sort
of
personal
pride
in
those
days
and
preferred
to
think
of
myself
as
a
decent
person
i
knew
that
people
would
say
the
same
sort
of
thing
about
me
that
they
said
about
all
the
rest
of
them
i
could
very
well
protest
i
been
scratching
the
backs
of
all
sorts
of
creatures
out
of
friendship
out
of
love
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
this
was
only
a
sort
of
last
straw
or
perhaps
it
was
the
sight
of
her
that
had
been
the
last
straw
it
seemed
naïvely
futile
to
have
been
wasting
my
time
over
hartly
and
those
she
stood
for
when
there
was
something
so
different
in
the
world
something
so
like
a
current
of
east
wind
that
vein
of
thought
kept
me
awake
and
a
worse
came
to
keep
it
company
the
men
from
the
next
room
came
home
students
i
suppose
they
talked
gaily
enough
their
remarks
interspersed
by
the
thuds
of
falling
boots
and
the
other
incomprehensible
noises
of
the
night
through
the
flimsy
partition
i
caught
half
sentences
in
that
sort
of
french
intonation
that
is
so
impossible
to
attain
it
reminded
me
of
the
voices
of
the
two
men
at
the
opera
i
began
to
wonder
what
they
had
been
saying
what
they
could
have
been
saying
that
concerned
me
and
affected
the
little
correspondent
to
interfere
suddenly
the
thing
dawned
upon
me
with
the
startling
clearness
of
a
figure
in
a
complicated
pattern
a
clearness
from
which
one
can
not
take
one
eyes
it
threw
everything
the
whole
world
into
more
unpleasant
relations
with
me
than
even
the
greenland
affair
they
had
not
been
talking
about
my
aunt
and
her
salon
but
about
my
my
sister
she
was
de
i
did
not
believe
it
but
probably
all
paris
the
whole
world
said
she
was
and
to
the
whole
world
i
was
her
brother
those
two
men
who
had
looked
at
me
over
their
shoulders
had
shrugged
and
said
oh
and
the
whole
world
wherever
i
went
would
whisper
in
asides
do
you
know
granger
he
the
brother
de
mersch
employs
him
i
began
to
understand
everything
the
woman
in
de
mersch
room
with
her
the
deference
of
the
little
jew
the
man
who
knew
knew
that
i
that
i
who
patronised
him
was
a
person
to
stand
well
with
because
of
my
my
sister
hold
over
de
mersch
i
was
of
course
but
you
ca
understand
how
the
whole
thing
maddened
me
all
the
same
i
hated
the
world
this
world
of
people
who
whispered
and
were
whispered
to
of
men
who
knew
and
men
who
wanted
to
know
the
shadowy
world
of
people
who
did
matter
but
whose
eyes
and
voices
were
all
round
one
and
did
somehow
matter
i
knew
well
enough
how
it
had
come
about
it
was
de
mersch
the
state
founder
with
his
shamed
face
and
his
pallid
hands
she
had
been
attracted
by
his
air
of
greatness
by
his
elective
by
his
protestations
women
are
like
that
she
had
been
attracted
and
did
know
what
she
was
doing
did
know
what
the
world
was
over
here
how
people
talked
she
had
been
excited
by
the
whirl
and
flutter
of
it
and
perhaps
she
did
care
the
thing
must
come
to
an
end
however
she
had
said
that
i
should
go
to
her
on
the
morrow
well
i
would
go
and
i
would
put
a
stop
to
this
i
had
suddenly
discovered
how
very
much
i
was
a
granger
of
etchingham
after
all
i
family
traditions
and
graves
behind
me
and
for
the
sake
of
all
these
people
whose
one
achievement
had
been
the
making
of
a
good
name
i
to
intervene
now
after
all
sang
does
not
get
itself
talked
about
in
way
the
early
afternoon
of
the
morrow
found
me
in
a
great
room
a
faded
sombre
salon
of
the
house
my
aunt
had
taken
in
the
faubourg
saint
germain
numbers
of
people
were
talking
in
groups
among
the
tables
and
chairs
of
a
time
before
the
revolution
i
rather
forget
how
i
had
got
there
and
what
had
gone
before
i
must
have
arisen
late
and
passed
the
intervening
hours
in
a
state
of
trepidation
i
was
going
to
see
her
and
i
was
like
a
cub
in
love
with
a
man
place
to
fill
it
was
a
preposterous
state
of
things
that
set
the
solid
world
in
a
whirl
once
there
my
eyes
suddenly
took
in
things
i
had
a
sense
of
her
standing
by
my
side
she
had
just
introduced
me
to
my
aunt
a
village
tyrant
she
was
so
obviously
worn
out
so
obviously
not
what
she
had
been
that
her
face
would
have
been
pitiful
but
for
its
immovable
expression
of
class
pride
the
grangers
of
etchingham
you
see
were
so
absolutely
at
the
top
of
their
own
particular
kind
of
tree
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
meet
anyone
who
was
not
an
inferior
a
man
might
be
a
cabinet
minister
might
even
be
a
prince
but
he
could
be
a
granger
of
etchingham
could
have
such
an
assortment
of
graves
each
containing
a
granger
behind
his
back
the
expression
did
even
lift
for
me
who
had
it
could
it
was
fixed
there
one
wondered
what
she
was
doing
in
this
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
should
interest
herself
in
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
they
were
all
very
well
but
they
even
english
let
alone
a
county
family
i
figured
it
out
that
she
must
have
set
her
own
village
so
much
in
order
that
there
remained
nothing
but
the
setting
in
order
of
the
rest
of
the
world
her
bored
eyes
wandered
sleepily
over
the
assemblage
they
seemed
to
have
no
preferences
for
any
of
them
they
rested
on
the
vacuously
bonaparte
prince
on
the
moribund
german
jesuit
to
whom
he
was
listening
on
the
darkly
supple
young
spanish
priest
on
the
english
passionist
on
radet
the
writer
of
that
article
in
the
who
was
talking
to
a
compatriot
in
one
of
the
tall
windows
she
seemed
to
accept
the
men
the
political
women
who
all
spoke
a
language
not
their
own
with
an
accent
and
a
fluency
and
a
dangerous
smile
and
a
display
of
questionable
teeth
all
their
own
she
seemed
to
class
the
political
with
the
pious
the
obvious
adventurer
with
the
seeming
fanatic
it
was
amazing
to
me
to
see
her
there
standing
with
her
county
family
in
the
midst
of
so
much
that
was
questionable
she
offered
me
no
explanation
i
had
to
find
one
for
myself
we
stood
and
talked
in
the
centre
of
the
room
it
did
not
seem
a
place
in
which
one
sit
why
have
you
never
been
to
see
me
she
asked
languidly
i
might
never
have
known
of
your
existence
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
sister
my
sister
was
standing
at
my
side
you
must
remember
i
do
suppose
that
i
started
but
i
made
my
aunt
no
answer
indeed
she
went
on
i
should
never
have
known
that
you
had
a
sister
your
father
was
so
peculiar
from
the
day
he
married
my
husband
never
heard
a
word
from
him
they
were
so
very
different
i
said
listlessly
ah
yes
she
answered
brothers
so
often
are
she
sighed
apropos
of
nothing
she
continued
to
utter
disjointed
sentences
from
which
i
gathered
a
skeleton
history
of
my
sister
introduction
of
herself
and
of
her
pretensions
she
had
it
seemed
casually
introduced
herself
at
some
or
function
of
the
sort
had
represented
herself
as
a
sister
of
my
own
to
whom
a
maternal
uncle
had
left
a
fabulous
fortune
she
herself
had
suggested
her
being
sheltered
under
my
aunt
roof
as
a
singularly
welcome
paying
guest
she
herself
too
had
suggested
the
visit
to
paris
and
had
hired
the
house
from
a
degenerate
duc
de
luynes
who
preferred
the
delights
of
an
in
the
less
lugubrious
avenue
marceau
we
have
tastes
so
much
in
common
my
aunt
explained
as
she
moved
away
to
welcome
a
new
arrival
i
was
left
alone
with
the
woman
who
called
herself
my
sister
we
stood
a
little
apart
each
little
group
of
talkers
in
the
vast
room
seemed
to
stand
just
without
earshot
of
the
next
i
had
my
back
to
the
door
my
face
to
her
and
so
you
have
come
she
said
maliciously
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
impossible
to
speak
in
a
position
in
such
a
place
impossible
to
hold
a
discussion
on
family
affairs
when
a
diminutive
irishwoman
with
too
mobile
eyebrows
and
a
couple
of
gigantic
lugubrious
spaniards
were
in
a
position
to
hear
anything
that
one
uttered
above
a
whisper
one
might
want
to
raise
one
voice
besides
she
was
so
so
terrible
there
was
no
knowing
what
she
might
not
say
she
so
obviously
did
not
care
what
the
irish
or
the
spaniards
or
the
jesuits
heard
or
thought
that
i
was
forced
to
the
mortifying
conclusion
that
i
did
oh
i
come
i
answered
i
felt
as
outrageously
out
of
it
as
one
does
at
a
suburban
hop
where
one
does
not
know
one
animal
of
the
menagerie
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
with
my
hands
i
was
pervaded
by
the
unpleasant
idea
that
all
those
furtive
eyes
were
upon
me
gauging
me
because
i
was
the
brother
of
a
personality
i
was
concerned
about
the
fit
of
my
coat
and
my
boots
and
all
the
while
i
was
in
a
furious
temper
my
errand
was
important
she
stood
looking
at
me
a
sinuous
brilliant
thing
with
a
light
in
the
eyes
half
challenging
half
openly
victorious
you
have
come
she
said
and
i
became
singularly
afraid
of
her
and
wanted
to
stop
her
mouth
she
might
be
going
to
say
anything
she
overpowered
me
so
that
i
actually
dwindled
into
the
gawkiness
of
extreme
youth
i
became
a
boy
again
and
made
a
boy
desperate
effort
after
a
recovery
at
one
stroke
of
an
ideal
standard
of
dignity
i
must
have
a
word
with
you
i
said
remembering
she
made
a
little
gesture
with
her
hands
signifying
i
am
here
but
in
private
i
added
oh
everything
in
private
here
she
said
i
was
silent
i
must
i
added
after
a
time
i
ca
retire
with
you
she
said
would
look
odd
you
say
would
you
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
in
intense
irritation
i
want
to
be
burlesqued
a
flood
of
fresh
people
came
into
the
room
i
heard
a
throaty
ahem
behind
me
the
duc
de
mersch
was
introducing
himself
to
notice
it
was
as
i
had
thought
the
man
was
an
habitue
with
his
clothes
his
air
of
protestation
and
his
tremendous
golden
poll
he
was
the
only
sunlight
that
the
gloomy
place
rejoiced
in
he
bowed
low
over
my
oppressor
hand
smiled
upon
me
and
began
to
utter
platitudes
in
english
oh
you
may
speak
french
she
said
carelessly
but
your
brother
he
answered
i
understand
french
very
well
i
said
i
was
in
no
mood
to
spare
him
embarrassments
wanted
to
show
him
that
i
had
a
hold
over
him
and
knew
he
was
the
proper
person
to
talk
to
a
young
lady
he
glared
at
me
haughtily
but
yesterday
he
began
in
a
tone
that
burlesqued
august
displeasure
i
was
wondering
what
he
had
looked
like
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
whilst
that
lady
had
been
explaining
his
nature
to
me
yesterday
i
wished
to
avoid
embarrassments
i
said
i
was
to
represent
your
views
about
greenland
i
might
have
misunderstood
you
in
some
important
matter
i
see
i
see
he
said
conciliatorily
yesterday
we
spoke
english
for
the
benefit
of
the
british
public
when
we
speak
french
we
are
not
in
public
i
hope
he
had
a
manner
everything
rather
too
much
in
public
here
i
answered
my
part
as
i
imagined
it
was
that
of
a
british
brother
defending
his
sister
from
questionable
attentions
the
person
who
tries
to
show
the
man
he
wanted
but
de
mersch
did
see
the
matter
in
that
light
at
all
he
could
not
of
course
he
was
as
much
used
to
being
purred
to
as
my
aunt
to
looking
down
on
persons
he
seemed
to
think
i
was
making
an
incomprehensible
insular
joke
and
laughed
it
would
have
been
possible
to
let
him
know
he
was
wanted
oh
you
need
be
afraid
of
my
brother
she
said
suddenly
he
is
quite
harmless
he
is
even
going
to
give
up
writing
for
the
papers
except
when
we
want
him
the
duc
turned
from
me
to
her
smiled
and
bowed
his
smile
was
inane
but
he
bowed
very
well
he
had
been
groomed
into
that
sort
of
thing
or
had
it
in
the
blood
we
work
together
still
he
asked
why
not
she
answered
a
hubbub
of
angry
voices
raised
itself
behind
my
back
it
was
one
of
the
that
made
the
salon
grangeur
famous
throughout
the
city
you
forced
yourself
upon
me
did
i
say
anywhere
that
you
were
responsible
if
it
resembles
your
particular
hell
upon
earth
what
is
that
to
me
you
do
worse
things
you
yourself
monsieur
have
i
seen
have
i
seen
it
the
duc
de
mersch
looked
swiftly
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
window
they
seem
to
be
angry
there
he
said
nervously
had
not
something
better
be
done
miss
granger
miss
granger
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
why
she
said
we
used
to
these
differences
of
opinion
besides
it
only
monsieur
radet
he
forever
at
war
with
someone
or
other
he
ought
to
be
shown
the
door
the
duc
grumbled
oh
as
for
that
she
answered
we
could
my
aunt
would
be
desolated
by
such
a
necessity
he
is
very
influential
in
certain
quarters
my
aunt
wants
to
catch
him
for
the
he
going
to
write
an
article
he
writes
too
many
articles
the
duc
said
with
heavy
displeasure
oh
he
has
written
too
many
she
answered
but
that
can
be
traversed
but
no
one
believes
the
duc
objected
radet
voice
intermittently
broke
in
upon
his
coming
to
our
ears
in
gusts
have
i
seen
you
and
then
and
you
offer
me
the
cross
to
bribe
me
to
silence
me
in
the
general
turning
of
faces
toward
the
window
in
which
stood
radet
and
the
other
mine
turned
too
radet
was
a
cadaverous
weatherworn
individual
and
worked
up
into
a
grotesquely
attitudinised
fury
of
injured
the
other
was
a
denationalised
sallow
governor
of
one
of
the
provinces
of
the
système
groënlandais
had
a
closely
barbered
head
a
bull
neck
and
a
great
belly
he
cast
furtive
glances
round
him
uncertain
whether
to
escape
or
to
wait
for
his
say
he
looked
at
the
ring
that
encircled
the
window
at
a
little
distance
and
his
face
which
had
betrayed
a
shame
hardened
at
sight
of
the
cynical
masks
of
the
cosmopolitan
conspirators
they
were
amused
by
the
scene
the
holsteiner
gained
confidence
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
have
had
the
fever
very
badly
since
you
came
back
he
said
showing
a
level
row
of
white
teeth
you
did
not
talk
like
that
out
there
no
si
you
would
have
hanged
me
perhaps
as
you
did
that
poor
devil
of
a
swiss
what
was
his
name
now
you
offer
me
the
cross
because
i
had
the
fever
i
had
been
watching
the
duc
face
a
first
red
flush
had
come
creeping
from
under
the
roots
of
his
beard
and
had
spread
over
the
low
forehead
and
the
sides
of
the
neck
the
fell
from
the
eye
a
signal
for
the
colour
to
retreat
the
full
lips
grew
pallid
and
began
to
mutter
unspoken
words
his
eyes
wandered
appealingly
from
the
woman
beside
him
to
me
did
want
to
look
him
in
the
face
the
man
was
a
trafficker
in
human
blood
an
evil
liver
and
i
hated
him
he
had
to
pay
his
price
would
have
to
pay
but
i
did
want
to
see
him
pay
it
there
was
a
limit
i
began
to
excuse
myself
and
slid
out
between
the
groups
of
excellent
plotters
as
i
was
going
she
said
to
me
you
may
come
to
me
in
the
morning
chapter
twelve
i
was
at
the
hôtel
de
luynes
or
granger
early
on
the
following
morning
the
mists
were
still
hanging
about
the
dismal
upper
windows
of
the
inscrutable
faubourg
the
toilet
of
the
city
was
being
completed
the
little
hoses
on
wheels
were
clattering
about
the
quiet
larger
streets
i
had
not
much
courage
thus
early
in
the
day
i
had
started
impulsively
stepping
with
the
impulse
of
immediate
action
from
the
doorstep
of
the
dairy
where
i
had
breakfasted
but
i
made
detours
it
was
too
early
and
my
pace
slackened
into
a
saunter
as
i
passed
the
row
of
porters
lodges
in
that
dead
inscrutable
street
i
wanted
to
fly
had
that
impulse
very
strongly
but
i
burnt
my
boats
with
my
inquiry
of
the
incredibly
ancient
porteress
i
made
my
way
across
the
damp
under
the
enormous
portico
and
into
the
chilly
stone
hall
that
no
amount
of
human
coming
and
going
sufficed
to
bring
back
to
a
semblance
of
life
mademoiselle
was
expecting
me
one
went
up
a
great
flight
of
stone
steps
into
one
of
the
immensely
high
narrow
impossibly
rectangular
that
one
sees
in
the
frontispieces
of
old
plays
the
furniture
looked
no
more
than
until
one
discovered
that
one
self
had
no
appreciable
stature
the
sad
light
slanted
in
ruled
lines
from
the
great
height
of
the
windows
an
army
of
motes
moved
slowly
in
and
out
of
the
shadows
i
went
after
awhile
and
looked
disconsolately
out
into
the
the
porteress
was
making
her
way
across
the
gravelled
space
her
arms
her
hands
the
pockets
of
her
black
apron
full
of
letters
of
all
sizes
i
remembered
that
the
had
followed
me
down
the
street
a
noise
of
voices
came
confusedly
to
my
ears
from
between
the
thing
reminded
me
of
my
waiting
in
de
mersch
rooms
it
did
not
last
so
long
the
voices
gathered
tone
as
they
do
at
the
end
of
a
colloquy
succeeded
each
other
at
longer
intervals
and
at
last
came
to
a
sustained
halt
the
tall
doors
moved
ajar
and
she
entered
followed
by
a
man
whom
i
recognized
as
the
governor
of
a
province
of
the
day
before
in
that
hostile
light
he
looked
old
and
weazened
and
worried
seemed
to
have
lost
much
of
his
rotundity
as
for
her
she
shone
with
a
light
of
her
own
he
greeted
me
dejectedly
and
did
not
brighten
when
she
let
him
know
that
we
had
a
mutual
friend
in
callan
the
governor
it
seemed
in
his
capacity
of
supervisor
of
the
système
was
to
conduct
that
distinguished
person
through
the
wilds
of
greenland
was
to
smooth
his
way
and
to
point
out
to
him
excellences
of
administration
i
wished
him
a
good
journey
he
sighed
and
began
to
fumble
with
his
hat
she
said
giving
him
leave
to
depart
he
looked
at
her
in
an
odd
sort
of
way
took
her
hand
and
applied
it
to
his
lips
he
said
with
a
heavy
sigh
drops
of
moisture
spattering
from
beneath
his
white
moustache
he
ogled
again
with
infinitesimal
eyes
and
went
out
of
the
room
he
had
the
air
of
wishing
to
wipe
the
perspiration
from
his
brows
and
to
exclaim
but
if
he
had
any
such
wish
he
mastered
it
until
the
door
hid
him
from
sight
why
the
i
began
before
it
had
well
closed
do
you
allow
that
thing
to
make
love
to
you
i
wanted
to
take
up
my
position
before
she
could
have
a
chance
to
make
me
ridiculous
i
wanted
to
make
a
long
speech
about
duty
to
the
name
of
granger
but
the
next
word
hung
and
before
it
came
she
had
answered
he
oh
i
making
use
of
him
to
inherit
the
earth
i
asked
ironically
and
she
answered
gravely
to
inherit
the
earth
she
was
leaning
against
the
window
playing
with
the
strings
of
the
blinds
and
silhouetted
against
the
leaden
light
she
seemed
to
be
physically
a
little
tired
and
the
lines
of
her
figure
to
interlace
almost
tenderly
to
compose
well
after
the
ideas
of
a
certain
school
i
knew
so
little
of
her
only
just
enough
to
be
in
love
with
her
that
this
struck
me
as
the
herald
of
a
new
phase
not
so
much
in
her
attitude
to
me
as
in
mine
to
her
she
had
even
then
a
sort
of
gravity
the
gravity
of
a
person
on
whom
things
were
beginning
to
weigh
but
i
said
irresolutely
i
could
not
speak
to
her
to
this
new
conception
of
her
in
the
way
i
had
planned
in
the
way
one
would
talk
to
a
brilliant
limpid
oh
to
a
woman
of
sorts
but
i
had
to
take
something
of
my
old
line
how
would
flirting
with
that
man
help
you
it
quite
simple
she
answered
he
to
show
callan
all
greenland
and
callan
is
to
write
callan
has
immense
influence
over
a
great
class
and
he
will
have
some
of
the
prestige
of
of
a
commissioner
oh
i
know
about
callan
i
said
and
she
went
on
this
man
had
orders
to
hide
things
from
callan
you
know
what
it
is
they
have
to
hide
but
he
wo
now
that
is
what
i
was
arranging
it
partly
by
bribery
and
partly
because
he
has
a
belief
in
his
so
callan
will
be
upset
and
will
write
an
exposure
the
sort
of
thing
callan
would
write
if
he
were
well
upset
and
he
will
be
by
what
this
man
will
let
him
see
you
know
what
a
little
man
like
callan
will
feel
he
will
be
made
ill
he
would
faint
at
the
sight
of
a
drop
of
blood
you
know
and
he
will
see
oh
the
very
worst
worse
than
what
radet
saw
and
he
will
write
a
frightful
article
and
it
will
be
a
thunderclap
for
de
mersch
and
de
mersch
will
be
getting
very
shaky
by
then
and
your
friend
churchill
will
try
to
carry
de
mersch
railway
bill
through
in
the
face
of
the
scandal
motives
will
be
excellent
but
everyone
will
say
you
know
what
people
say
that
is
what
i
and
gurnard
want
we
want
people
to
talk
we
want
them
to
believe
i
do
know
whether
there
really
was
a
hesitation
in
her
voice
or
whether
i
read
that
into
it
she
stood
there
playing
with
the
knots
of
the
and
speaking
in
a
low
monotone
the
whole
thing
the
sad
twilight
of
the
place
her
tone
of
voice
seemed
tinged
with
unavailing
regret
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
dimensionist
story
and
i
had
never
believed
in
it
but
now
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
have
my
doubts
i
was
certain
that
she
had
been
plotting
with
one
of
the
duc
de
mersch
lieutenants
the
man
manner
vouched
for
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
look
me
in
the
face
but
more
than
anything
his
voice
and
manner
made
me
feel
that
we
had
passed
out
of
a
realm
of
farcical
allegory
i
knew
enough
to
see
that
she
might
be
speaking
the
truth
and
if
she
were
her
calm
avowal
of
such
treachery
proved
that
she
what
she
had
said
the
dimensionists
were
cold
with
no
scruples
and
admirably
courageous
and
indubitably
enemies
of
society
i
do
understand
i
said
but
de
mersch
then
she
made
a
little
gesture
one
of
those
movements
that
i
best
remember
of
her
the
smallest
the
least
noticeable
it
reduced
de
mersch
to
nothing
he
no
longer
even
counted
oh
as
for
him
she
said
he
is
only
a
detail
i
had
still
the
idea
that
she
spoke
with
a
pitying
intonation
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
a
dog
in
pain
he
does
really
count
not
really
he
will
crumble
up
and
disappear
very
soon
you
wo
even
remember
him
but
i
said
you
go
about
with
him
as
if
you
you
are
getting
yourself
talked
about
everyone
thinks
the
accusation
that
i
had
come
to
make
seemed
impossible
now
i
was
facing
her
i
believe
i
added
with
the
suddenness
of
inspiration
i
certain
even
that
thinks
that
you
well
they
think
that
sort
of
thing
but
it
is
only
part
of
the
game
oh
i
assure
you
it
is
no
more
than
that
i
was
silent
i
felt
that
for
one
reason
or
another
she
wished
me
to
believe
yes
she
said
i
want
you
to
believe
it
will
save
you
a
good
deal
of
pain
if
you
wanted
to
save
me
pain
i
maintained
you
would
have
done
with
de
mersch
for
good
i
had
an
idea
that
the
solution
was
beyond
me
it
was
as
if
the
controlling
powers
were
flitting
invisible
just
above
my
head
just
beyond
my
grasp
there
was
obviously
something
vibrating
some
cord
somewhere
stretched
very
taut
and
quivering
but
i
could
think
of
no
better
solution
than
you
must
have
done
with
him
it
seemed
obvious
too
that
that
was
impossible
was
outside
the
range
of
things
that
could
be
done
but
i
had
to
do
my
best
it
a
it
vile
i
added
vile
oh
i
know
i
know
she
said
for
you
and
i
even
sorry
but
it
has
to
be
gone
on
with
de
mersch
has
to
go
under
in
just
this
way
it
ca
be
any
other
why
not
i
asked
because
she
had
paused
i
had
any
desire
for
enlightenment
it
is
even
only
churchill
she
said
not
even
only
that
de
mersch
will
bring
down
churchill
with
him
it
is
that
he
must
bring
down
everything
that
churchill
stands
for
you
know
what
that
is
the
sort
of
probity
all
the
old
order
of
things
and
the
more
vile
the
means
used
to
destroy
de
mersch
the
more
vile
the
whole
affair
will
seem
people
the
sort
of
people
have
an
idea
that
a
decent
man
can
not
be
touched
by
tortuous
intrigues
and
the
whole
thing
will
be
oh
malodorous
you
understand
i
do
i
answered
i
do
understand
at
all
ah
yes
you
do
she
said
you
understand
she
paused
for
a
long
while
and
i
was
silent
i
understood
vaguely
what
she
meant
that
if
churchill
fell
amid
the
clouds
of
dust
of
such
a
collapse
there
would
be
an
end
of
belief
in
probity
or
nearly
an
end
but
i
could
not
see
what
it
all
led
up
to
where
it
left
us
you
see
she
began
again
i
want
to
make
it
as
little
painful
to
you
as
i
can
as
little
painful
as
explanations
make
it
i
ca
feel
as
you
feel
but
i
can
see
rather
dimly
what
it
is
that
hurts
you
and
so
i
want
to
i
really
want
to
but
you
wo
do
the
one
thing
i
returned
hopelessly
to
the
charge
i
can
not
she
answered
it
must
be
like
that
there
is
any
way
you
are
so
tied
down
to
these
little
things
do
you
see
that
de
mersch
and
and
all
these
people
do
really
count
they
anything
at
all
in
the
scheme
of
things
i
think
that
even
for
you
they
are
worth
bothering
about
they
only
accidents
the
accidents
that
that
what
i
asked
although
i
began
to
see
dimly
what
she
meant
that
lead
in
the
inevitable
she
answered
do
you
see
do
you
understand
we
the
inevitable
and
you
ca
keep
us
back
we
have
to
come
and
you
you
will
only
hurt
yourself
by
resisting
a
sense
that
this
was
the
truth
the
only
truth
beset
me
it
was
for
the
moment
impossible
to
think
of
anything
else
of
anything
else
in
the
world
you
must
accept
us
and
all
that
we
mean
you
must
stand
back
sooner
or
later
look
even
all
round
you
and
you
will
understand
better
you
are
in
the
house
of
a
type
a
type
that
became
impossible
oh
centuries
ago
and
that
type
too
tried
very
hard
to
keep
back
the
inevitable
not
only
because
itself
went
under
but
because
everything
that
it
stood
for
went
under
and
it
had
to
suffer
heartache
that
sort
of
suffering
is
it
so
i
did
not
answer
the
illustration
was
too
abominably
just
it
was
just
that
there
were
even
now
all
these
people
these
legitimists
sneering
ineffectually
shutting
themselves
away
from
the
light
in
their
mournful
houses
and
suffering
horribly
because
everything
that
they
stood
for
had
gone
under
but
even
if
i
believe
you
i
said
the
thing
is
too
horrible
and
your
tools
are
too
mean
that
man
who
has
just
gone
out
and
and
callan
are
they
the
weapons
of
the
inevitable
after
all
the
revolution
i
was
striving
to
get
back
to
tangible
ideas
ideas
that
one
could
name
and
date
and
label
the
revolution
was
noble
in
essence
and
made
for
good
but
all
this
of
yours
is
too
vile
and
too
petty
you
are
bribing
or
something
worse
that
man
to
betray
his
master
and
that
you
call
helping
on
the
inevitable
they
used
to
say
just
that
of
the
revolution
that
was
nice
of
its
tools
do
you
see
they
were
the
people
that
went
under
they
could
see
the
good
and
i
i
am
to
take
it
on
trust
i
said
bitterly
you
could
see
the
good
she
answered
it
is
possible
and
there
is
no
way
of
explaining
our
languages
are
different
and
there
no
bridge
no
bridge
at
all
we
meet
it
was
that
revolted
me
if
there
was
no
bridge
and
we
could
not
meet
we
must
even
fight
that
is
if
i
believed
her
version
of
herself
if
i
did
not
i
was
being
played
the
fool
with
i
preferred
to
think
that
if
she
were
only
fooling
me
she
remained
attainable
if
it
was
as
she
said
there
was
no
hope
at
all
not
any
i
do
believe
you
i
said
suddenly
i
did
want
to
believe
her
the
thing
was
too
abominable
too
abominable
for
words
and
incredible
i
struggled
against
it
as
one
struggles
against
inevitable
madness
against
the
thought
of
it
it
hung
over
me
stupefying
deadening
one
could
only
fight
it
with
violence
crudely
in
jerks
as
one
struggles
against
the
numbness
of
frost
it
was
like
a
pall
like
descending
clouds
of
smoke
seemed
to
be
actually
present
in
the
absurdly
lofty
room
this
belief
in
what
she
stood
for
in
what
she
said
she
stood
for
i
do
believe
you
i
proclaimed
i
wo
you
are
playing
the
fool
with
me
trying
to
get
round
me
to
make
me
let
you
go
on
with
these
with
these
it
is
abominable
think
of
what
it
means
for
me
what
people
are
saying
of
me
and
i
am
a
decent
man
you
shall
not
do
you
understand
you
not
it
is
unbearable
and
you
you
try
to
fool
me
in
order
to
keep
me
quiet
oh
no
she
said
oh
no
she
had
an
accent
that
touched
grief
as
nearly
as
she
could
touch
it
i
remember
it
now
as
one
remembers
these
things
but
then
i
passed
it
over
i
was
too
much
moved
myself
to
notice
it
more
than
subconsciously
as
one
notices
things
past
which
one
is
whirled
and
i
was
whirled
past
these
things
in
an
ungovernable
fury
at
the
remembrance
of
what
i
had
suffered
of
what
i
had
still
to
suffer
i
was
speaking
with
intense
rage
jerking
out
words
ideas
as
floodwater
jerks
through
a
sluice
the
of
once
ordered
fields
you
are
i
said
you
you
you
dragging
an
ancient
name
through
the
dust
you
i
forget
what
i
said
but
i
remember
dragging
an
ancient
name
it
struck
me
at
the
time
by
its
forlornness
as
part
of
an
appeal
to
her
it
was
so
pathetically
tiny
a
motive
so
out
of
tone
that
it
stuck
in
my
mind
i
only
remember
the
upshot
of
my
speech
that
unless
she
swore
oh
yes
swore
to
have
done
with
de
mersch
i
would
denounce
her
to
my
aunt
at
that
very
moment
and
in
that
very
house
and
she
said
that
it
was
impossible
chapter
thirteen
i
had
a
sense
of
walking
very
fast
almost
of
taking
flight
down
a
long
dim
corridor
and
of
a
door
that
opened
into
an
immense
room
all
that
i
remember
of
it
as
i
saw
it
then
was
a
number
of
pastel
portraits
of
weak
vacuous
individuals
in
dulled
gilt
oval
frames
the
heads
stood
out
from
the
panelling
and
stared
at
me
from
between
ringlets
from
under
powdered
hair
simpering
or
contemptuous
with
the
expression
that
must
have
prevailed
in
the
of
the
time
before
the
revolution
at
a
great
distance
bent
over
account
books
and
pink
cheques
on
the
flap
of
an
escritoire
sat
my
aunt
very
small
very
grey
very
intent
on
her
work
the
people
who
built
these
rooms
must
have
had
some
property
of
the
presence
to
make
them
bulk
large
if
they
ever
really
did
so
in
the
eyes
of
dependents
of
lackeys
perhaps
it
was
their
sense
of
ownership
that
gave
them
the
necessary
prestige
my
aunt
who
was
only
a
temporary
occupant
certainly
had
none
of
it
bent
intently
over
her
accounts
peering
through
her
spectacles
at
columns
of
figures
she
was
nothing
but
a
little
old
woman
alone
in
an
immense
room
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
really
have
any
family
pride
any
pride
of
any
sort
she
looked
round
at
me
over
her
spectacles
across
her
shoulder
ah
etchingham
she
said
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
carry
herself
back
to
england
to
the
england
of
her
and
her
select
visiting
list
here
she
was
no
more
superior
than
if
we
had
been
on
a
desert
island
i
wanted
to
enlighten
her
as
to
the
woman
she
was
sheltering
wanted
to
very
badly
but
a
necessity
for
introducing
the
matter
seemed
to
arise
as
she
gradually
stiffened
into
assertiveness
my
dear
aunt
i
said
the
woman
the
alien
nature
of
the
theme
grew
suddenly
formidable
she
looked
at
me
arousedly
you
got
my
note
then
she
said
but
i
do
think
a
woman
have
brought
it
i
have
given
such
strict
orders
they
have
such
strange
ideas
here
though
and
madame
the
is
an
old
retainer
of
de
luynes
i
have
much
influence
over
her
it
is
absurd
but
it
seems
that
the
old
lady
in
the
lodge
made
a
point
of
carrying
letters
that
went
by
hand
she
had
an
eye
for
gratuities
and
the
police
i
should
say
were
concerned
they
make
a
good
deal
of
use
of
that
sort
of
person
in
that
neighbourhood
of
infinitesimal
and
unceasing
plotting
i
did
mean
that
i
said
but
the
woman
who
calls
herself
my
sister
my
dear
nephew
she
interrupted
with
tranquil
force
as
if
she
were
taking
an
arranged
line
i
can
not
i
absolutely
can
not
be
worried
with
your
quarrels
with
your
sister
as
i
said
to
you
in
my
note
of
this
morning
when
you
are
in
this
town
you
must
consider
this
house
your
home
it
is
almost
insulting
of
you
to
go
to
an
inn
i
am
told
it
is
even
quite
an
unfit
place
that
you
are
stopping
at
for
a
member
of
our
family
i
maintained
for
a
few
seconds
a
silence
of
astonishment
but
i
returned
to
the
charge
the
matter
is
one
of
importance
you
must
understand
that
she
my
aunt
stiffened
and
froze
it
was
as
if
i
had
committed
some
flagrant
sin
against
etiquette
if
i
am
satisfied
as
to
her
behaviour
she
said
i
think
that
you
might
be
she
paused
as
if
she
were
satisfied
that
she
had
set
me
hopelessly
in
the
wrong
i
do
withdraw
my
invitation
she
said
you
must
understand
i
you
to
come
here
but
your
quarrels
you
and
she
must
settle
on
those
terms
she
had
the
air
of
conferring
an
immense
favour
as
if
she
believed
that
i
had
all
my
life
through
been
waiting
for
her
invitation
to
come
within
the
pale
as
for
me
i
felt
a
certain
relief
at
having
the
carrying
out
of
my
duty
made
impossible
for
me
i
did
not
to
tell
my
aunt
and
thus
to
break
things
off
definitely
and
for
good
something
would
have
happened
the
air
might
have
cleared
as
it
clears
after
a
storm
i
should
have
learnt
where
i
stood
but
i
was
afraid
of
the
knowledge
light
in
these
dark
places
might
reveal
an
abyss
at
my
feet
i
wanted
to
let
things
slide
my
aunt
had
returned
to
her
accounts
the
accounts
which
were
the
that
kept
running
the
smooth
course
of
the
etchingham
estates
she
seemed
to
wish
to
indicate
that
i
counted
for
not
very
much
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
she
saw
it
i
should
like
to
make
your
better
acquaintance
she
said
with
her
head
still
averted
there
are
reasons
it
came
suddenly
into
my
head
that
she
had
an
idea
of
testamentary
dispositions
that
she
felt
she
was
breaking
up
that
i
had
my
rights
i
did
much
care
for
the
thing
but
the
idea
of
being
the
heir
of
etchingham
was
well
was
an
idea
it
would
make
me
more
possible
to
my
it
would
be
as
it
were
a
would
make
me
potentially
a
somebody
of
her
sort
of
ideal
moreover
i
should
be
under
the
same
roof
near
her
with
her
sometimes
one
asks
so
little
more
than
that
that
it
seemed
almost
half
the
battle
i
began
to
consider
phrases
of
thanks
and
acceptance
and
then
uttered
them
i
never
quite
understood
the
bearings
of
that
scene
never
quite
whether
my
aunt
really
knew
that
my
sister
was
not
my
sister
she
was
a
wonderfully
clever
woman
of
the
unscrupulous
order
with
a
and
well
calculated
to
let
her
cut
short
any
inconvenient
revelations
it
was
as
if
she
had
had
long
practice
in
the
art
though
i
can
not
say
what
occasion
she
can
have
had
for
its
practice
perhaps
for
the
confounding
of
wavering
avowers
of
dissent
at
home
i
used
to
think
that
she
knew
if
not
all
at
least
a
portion
that
the
weight
that
undoubtedly
was
upon
her
mind
was
nothing
else
but
that
she
broke
up
was
breaking
up
from
day
to
day
and
i
can
think
of
no
other
reason
she
had
the
air
of
being
disintegrated
like
a
mineral
under
an
immense
weight
quartz
in
a
crushing
mill
of
being
dulled
and
numbed
as
if
she
were
under
the
influence
of
narcotics
there
is
little
enough
wonder
if
she
actually
carried
that
imponderable
secret
about
with
her
i
used
to
look
at
her
sometimes
and
wonder
if
she
too
saw
the
oncoming
of
the
inevitable
she
was
limited
enough
in
her
ideas
but
not
too
stupid
to
take
that
in
if
it
presented
itself
indeed
they
have
that
sort
of
idea
rather
grimly
before
them
all
the
time
that
class
it
must
have
been
that
that
was
daily
and
little
by
little
pressing
down
her
eyelids
and
deepening
the
quivering
lines
of
her
impenetrable
face
she
had
a
certain
solitary
grandeur
the
pathos
attaching
to
the
last
of
a
race
of
a
type
the
air
of
waiting
for
the
deluge
of
listening
for
an
inevitable
sound
the
sound
of
oncoming
waters
it
was
weird
the
time
that
i
spent
in
that
house
more
than
weird
deadening
it
had
an
extraordinary
effect
on
me
an
effect
that
my
sister
perhaps
had
carefully
calculated
she
made
pretensions
of
that
sort
later
on
said
that
she
had
been
breaking
me
in
to
perform
my
allotted
task
in
the
bringing
on
of
the
inevitable
i
have
nowhere
come
across
such
an
intense
solitude
as
there
was
there
a
solitude
that
threw
one
so
absolutely
upon
one
self
and
into
self
i
used
to
sit
working
in
one
of
those
tall
panelled
rooms
very
high
up
in
the
air
i
was
writing
at
the
series
of
articles
for
the
for
polehampton
i
was
to
get
the
atmosphere
of
paris
you
remember
it
was
rather
extraordinary
that
process
up
there
i
seemed
to
be
as
much
isolated
from
paris
as
if
i
had
been
in
well
in
hampton
court
it
was
almost
impossible
to
write
i
had
things
to
think
about
preoccupations
jealousies
it
was
true
i
had
a
living
to
make
but
that
seemed
to
have
lost
its
engrossingness
as
a
pursuit
or
at
least
to
have
suspended
it
the
panels
of
the
room
seemed
to
act
as
a
the
belly
of
an
immense
there
were
never
any
noises
in
the
house
only
whispers
coming
from
an
immense
distance
as
when
one
drops
stones
down
an
unfathomable
well
and
hears
ages
afterward
the
faint
sound
of
disturbed
waters
when
i
look
back
at
that
time
i
figure
myself
as
forever
sitting
with
uplifted
pen
waiting
for
a
word
that
would
not
come
and
that
i
did
not
much
care
about
getting
the
panels
of
the
room
would
creak
sympathetically
to
the
opening
of
the
of
the
house
the
faintest
of
creaks
people
would
cross
the
immense
hall
to
the
room
in
which
they
plotted
would
cross
leisurely
with
laughter
and
rustling
of
garments
that
after
a
long
time
reached
my
ears
in
whispers
then
i
should
have
an
access
of
mad
jealousy
i
wanted
to
be
part
of
her
life
but
i
could
not
stand
that
salon
of
suspicious
conspirators
what
could
i
do
there
stand
and
look
at
them
conscious
that
they
all
dropped
their
voices
instinctively
when
i
came
near
them
that
was
the
general
tone
of
that
space
of
time
but
of
course
it
was
not
always
that
i
used
to
emerge
now
and
then
to
breakfast
sympathetically
with
my
aunt
sometimes
to
sit
through
a
meal
with
the
two
of
them
i
danced
attendance
on
them
singly
paid
depressing
calls
with
my
aunt
calls
on
the
people
in
the
faubourg
people
without
any
individuality
other
than
a
kind
of
desiccation
the
shrivelled
appearance
and
point
of
view
of
a
dried
pippin
in
revenge
they
had
names
that
startled
one
names
that
recalled
the
generals
and
of
an
impossibly
distant
time
names
that
could
hardly
have
had
any
existence
outside
the
memoirs
of
madame
de
sévigné
the
names
of
people
that
could
hardly
have
been
fitted
to
do
anything
more
vigorous
than
be
reflected
in
the
mirrors
of
the
des
i
was
so
absolutely
depressed
so
absolutely
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
that
i
seemed
to
conform
exactly
to
my
aunt
ideas
of
what
was
desirable
in
me
as
an
attendant
on
her
at
these
functions
i
used
to
stand
behind
chairs
and
talk
like
a
good
young
man
to
the
assorted
and
who
were
generally
present
and
then
i
used
to
go
home
and
get
the
atmospheres
of
these
people
i
must
have
done
it
abominably
badly
for
the
notes
that
brought
polehampton
cheques
were
accompanied
by
the
bravos
of
that
gentleman
and
the
assurances
that
miss
polehampton
liked
my
work
liked
it
very
much
i
suppose
i
exhibited
myself
in
the
capacity
of
the
man
who
knew
who
could
let
you
into
a
thing
or
two
after
all
anyone
could
write
about
students
balls
and
the
lakes
in
the
bois
but
it
took
to
write
with
knowledge
of
the
interiors
of
the
barred
houses
in
the
rue
de
then
too
i
attended
the
more
showy
entertainments
with
my
sister
i
had
by
now
become
so
used
to
hearing
her
styled
your
sister
that
the
epithet
had
the
quality
of
a
name
she
was
mademoiselle
votre
soeur
as
she
might
have
been
mlle
patience
or
hope
without
having
anything
of
the
named
quality
what
she
did
at
the
entertainments
the
charitable
bazaars
the
dismal
dances
the
impossibly
bad
concerts
i
have
no
idea
she
must
have
had
some
purpose
for
she
did
nothing
without
i
myself
descended
into
fulfilling
the
functions
of
a
rudimentarily
developed
chaperon
functions
similar
in
importance
to
those
performed
by
the
eyes
of
a
mole
i
had
the
maddest
of
accesses
of
jealousy
if
she
talked
to
a
man
and
men
or
danced
with
one
and
then
i
was
forever
screwing
my
courage
up
and
feeling
it
die
away
we
used
to
drive
about
in
a
coupe
a
thing
that
shut
us
inexorably
together
but
which
quite
as
inexorably
destroyed
all
opportunities
for
what
one
calls
making
love
in
smooth
streets
its
motion
was
too
glib
on
the
it
rattled
too
abominably
i
wanted
to
make
love
to
her
oh
immensely
but
i
was
never
in
the
mood
or
the
opportunity
was
never
forthcoming
i
used
to
have
the
wildest
fits
of
irritation
not
of
madness
or
of
depression
but
of
simple
wildness
at
the
continual
recurrence
of
small
obstacles
i
could
read
could
bring
myself
to
it
i
used
to
sit
and
look
dazedly
at
the
english
newspapers
at
any
newspaper
but
the
de
mersch
had
for
the
moment
disappeared
there
were
troubles
in
his
elective
grand
duchy
he
had
indeed
contrived
to
make
himself
unpopular
with
the
electors
excessively
unpopular
i
used
to
read
piquant
articles
about
his
embroglio
in
an
american
paper
that
devoted
itself
to
matters
of
the
sort
all
sorts
of
international
difficulties
were
to
arise
if
de
mersch
were
ejected
there
was
some
other
obscure
prince
of
a
rival
house
prussian
or
russian
who
had
desires
for
the
degree
of
royalty
that
sat
so
heavily
on
de
mersch
indeed
i
think
there
were
two
rival
princes
each
waiting
with
portmanteaux
packed
and
manifestos
in
their
breast
pockets
ready
to
pass
de
mersch
frontiers
the
grievances
of
his
subjects
so
the
said
were
intimately
connected
with
matters
of
finance
and
de
personal
finances
and
his
grand
ducal
were
inextricably
mixed
up
with
the
schemes
with
which
he
was
seeking
to
make
a
fortune
large
enough
to
enable
him
to
laugh
at
half
a
dozen
elective
grand
duchies
indeed
de
mersch
own
portmanteau
was
reported
to
be
packed
against
the
day
when
british
support
of
his
greenland
schemes
would
let
him
afford
to
laugh
at
his
cantankerous
diet
the
thing
interested
me
so
little
that
i
never
quite
mastered
the
details
of
it
i
wished
the
man
no
good
but
so
long
as
he
kept
out
of
my
way
i
was
not
going
to
hate
him
actively
finally
the
affairs
of
ceased
to
occupy
the
papers
the
thing
was
arranged
and
the
russian
and
prussian
princes
unpacked
their
portmanteaux
and
i
suppose
consigned
their
manifestos
to
the
flames
or
adapted
them
to
the
needs
of
other
principalities
de
mersch
affairs
ceded
their
space
in
the
public
prints
to
the
topic
of
the
dearness
of
money
somebody
somewhere
was
said
to
be
up
to
something
i
used
to
try
to
read
the
articles
to
master
the
details
because
i
disliked
finding
a
whole
field
of
thought
of
which
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
i
used
to
read
about
the
great
discount
houses
and
other
things
that
conveyed
absolutely
nothing
to
my
mind
i
only
gathered
that
the
said
great
houses
were
having
a
very
bad
time
and
that
everybody
else
was
having
a
very
much
worse
one
day
indeed
the
matter
was
brought
home
to
me
by
the
receipt
from
polehampton
of
bills
instead
of
my
usual
cheques
i
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
cashing
the
things
indeed
people
seemed
to
look
askance
at
them
i
consulted
my
aunt
on
the
subject
at
breakfast
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
interested
the
woman
of
business
in
her
and
we
were
always
short
of
topics
of
conversation
we
breakfasted
in
rather
a
small
room
as
rooms
went
there
my
aunt
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
an
early
morning
air
of
being
that
she
wore
at
no
other
time
of
day
it
was
not
a
matter
of
garments
for
she
was
not
the
woman
to
wear
a
but
lay
i
supposed
in
her
manner
which
did
not
begin
to
assume
frigidity
until
several
watches
of
the
day
had
passed
i
handed
her
polehampton
bills
and
explained
that
i
was
at
a
loss
to
turn
them
to
account
that
i
even
had
only
the
very
haziest
of
ideas
as
to
their
meaning
holding
the
forlorn
papers
in
her
hand
she
began
to
lecture
me
on
the
duty
of
acquiring
the
rudiments
of
what
she
called
business
habits
of
course
you
do
not
require
to
master
details
to
any
considerable
extent
she
said
but
i
always
have
held
that
it
is
one
of
the
duties
of
a
she
interrupted
herself
as
my
sister
came
into
the
room
looked
at
her
and
then
held
out
the
papers
in
her
hand
the
things
quivered
a
little
the
hand
must
have
quivered
too
you
are
going
to
halderschrodt
she
said
interrogatively
you
could
get
him
to
negotiate
these
for
etchingham
miss
granger
looked
at
the
papers
negligently
i
am
going
this
afternoon
she
answered
etchingham
can
come
she
suddenly
turned
to
me
so
your
friend
is
getting
shaky
she
said
it
means
that
i
asked
but
i
heard
that
he
has
done
the
same
sort
of
thing
before
he
must
have
been
shaky
before
she
said
but
i
daresay
halderschrodt
oh
it
hardly
worth
while
bothering
that
personage
about
such
a
sum
i
interrupted
halderschrodt
in
those
days
was
a
name
that
suggested
no
dealings
in
any
sum
less
than
a
million
my
dear
etchingham
my
aunt
interrupted
in
a
shocked
tone
it
is
quite
worth
his
while
to
oblige
us
i
did
know
i
said
that
afternoon
we
drove
to
halderschrodt
private
office
a
sumptuous
that
is
the
suite
of
rooms
on
the
first
floor
of
the
house
next
to
the
duc
de
mersch
i
sat
on
a
gilded
chair
whilst
my
transacted
her
business
in
an
adjoining
room
a
room
exactly
corresponding
with
that
within
which
de
mersch
had
lurked
whilst
the
lady
was
warning
me
against
him
a
clerk
came
after
awhile
carried
me
off
into
an
enclosure
where
my
bill
was
discounted
by
another
and
then
reconducted
me
to
my
plush
chair
i
did
not
occupy
it
as
it
happened
a
meagre
very
tall
alsatian
was
holding
the
door
open
for
the
exit
of
my
sister
he
said
nothing
at
all
but
stood
slightly
inclined
as
she
passed
him
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
red
long
face
very
tired
eyes
and
hair
of
almost
startling
whiteness
the
white
hair
of
a
comparatively
young
man
without
any
lustre
of
any
sort
a
dead
white
like
that
of
snow
i
remember
that
white
hair
with
a
feeling
of
horror
whilst
i
have
almost
forgotten
the
features
of
the
great
baron
de
halderschrodt
i
had
still
some
of
the
feeling
of
having
been
in
contact
with
a
personality
of
the
most
colossal
significance
as
we
went
down
the
red
carpet
of
the
broad
white
marble
stairs
with
one
foot
on
the
lowest
step
the
figure
of
a
perfectly
clothed
perfectly
groomed
man
was
standing
looking
upward
at
our
descent
i
had
thought
so
little
of
him
that
the
sight
of
the
duc
de
mersch
face
hardly
suggested
any
train
of
emotions
it
lit
up
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
you
he
said
she
stood
looking
down
upon
him
from
the
altitude
of
two
steps
looking
with
intolerable
passivity
so
you
use
the
common
stairs
she
said
one
had
the
idea
that
you
communicated
with
these
people
through
a
private
door
he
laughed
uneasily
looking
askance
at
me
oh
i
he
said
she
moved
a
little
to
one
side
to
pass
him
in
her
descent
so
things
have
arranged
themselves
she
said
referring
i
supposed
to
the
elective
grand
duchy
oh
it
was
like
a
miracle
he
answered
and
i
owed
a
great
deal
a
great
deal
to
your
hints
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
de
mersch
face
had
an
extraordinary
quality
that
i
seemed
to
notice
in
all
the
faces
around
me
a
quality
of
the
flesh
that
seemed
to
lose
all
luminosity
of
the
eyes
that
seemed
forever
to
have
a
tendency
to
seek
the
ground
to
avoid
the
sight
of
the
world
when
he
brightened
to
answer
her
it
was
as
if
with
effort
it
seemed
as
if
a
weight
were
on
the
mind
of
the
whole
world
a
preoccupation
that
i
shared
without
understanding
she
herself
a
certain
apart
seemed
the
only
one
that
was
entirely
unaffected
as
we
sat
side
by
side
in
the
little
carriage
she
said
suddenly
they
are
coming
to
the
end
of
their
tether
you
see
i
shrank
away
from
her
a
little
but
i
did
not
see
and
did
not
want
to
see
i
said
so
it
even
seemed
to
me
that
de
mersch
having
got
over
the
troubles
was
taking
a
new
lease
of
life
i
think
i
said
a
little
time
ago
that
the
wheels
of
the
coupe
suddenly
began
to
rattle
abominably
over
the
cobbles
of
a
narrow
street
it
was
impossible
to
talk
and
i
was
thrown
back
upon
myself
i
found
that
i
was
in
a
temper
in
an
abominable
temper
the
sudden
sight
of
that
man
her
method
of
greeting
him
the
intimacy
that
the
scene
revealed
the
whole
thing
had
upset
me
of
late
for
want
of
any
alarms
in
spite
of
groundlessness
i
had
had
the
impression
that
i
was
the
integral
part
of
her
life
it
was
not
a
logical
idea
but
strictly
a
habit
of
mind
that
had
grown
up
in
the
desolation
of
my
solitude
we
passed
into
one
of
the
larger
boulevards
and
the
thing
ran
silently
that
de
mersch
was
crumbling
up
she
suddenly
completed
my
unfinished
sentence
oh
that
was
only
a
grumble
premonitory
but
it
wo
take
long
now
i
have
been
putting
on
the
screw
halderschrodt
will
i
suppose
he
will
commit
suicide
in
a
day
or
two
and
then
the
the
fun
will
begin
i
did
answer
the
thing
made
no
impression
no
mental
impression
at
all
chapter
fourteen
that
afternoon
we
had
a
scene
and
late
that
night
another
the
memory
of
the
former
is
a
little
blotted
out
things
began
to
move
so
quickly
that
try
as
i
will
to
arrange
their
sequence
in
my
mind
i
can
not
i
can
not
even
very
distinctly
remember
what
she
told
me
at
that
first
explanation
i
must
have
attacked
her
fiercely
on
the
score
of
de
mersch
in
the
old
vein
must
have
told
her
that
i
would
not
in
the
interest
of
the
name
allow
her
to
see
the
man
again
she
told
me
things
too
rather
abominable
things
about
the
way
in
which
she
had
got
halderschrodt
into
her
power
and
was
pressing
him
down
halderschrodt
was
de
mersch
his
fall
would
mean
de
mersch
and
so
on
the
so
on
in
this
case
meant
a
great
deal
more
halderschrodt
apparently
was
the
somebody
who
was
up
to
something
of
the
american
paper
that
is
to
say
the
allied
firms
that
halderschrodt
represented
i
ca
remember
the
details
they
were
too
huge
and
too
unfamiliar
and
i
was
too
agitated
by
my
own
share
in
the
humanity
of
it
but
in
sum
it
seemed
that
the
fall
of
halderschrodt
would
mean
a
sort
of
incredibly
vast
black
monday
a
frightful
thing
in
the
existing
state
of
public
confidence
but
one
which
did
not
mean
much
to
me
i
forget
how
she
said
she
had
been
able
to
put
the
screw
on
him
halderschrodt
as
you
must
remember
was
the
third
of
his
colossal
name
a
man
without
much
genius
and
conscious
of
the
lack
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
operating
some
enormous
coup
like
the
founder
of
his
dynasty
something
in
which
foresight
in
international
occurrence
played
a
chief
part
that
idea
was
his
weakness
the
defect
of
his
mind
and
she
had
played
on
that
weakness
i
forget
i
say
the
details
if
i
ever
heard
them
they
concerned
themselves
with
a
dynastic
revolution
somewhere
a
revolution
that
was
to
cause
a
slump
all
over
the
world
and
that
had
been
engineered
in
our
salon
and
she
had
burked
the
revolution
betrayed
it
i
suppose
and
the
consequences
did
not
ensue
and
halderschrodt
and
all
the
rest
of
them
were
left
high
and
dry
the
whole
thing
was
a
matter
of
that
never
came
to
the
surface
a
matter
of
shifting
sands
from
which
only
those
with
the
clearest
heads
could
come
forth
and
we
we
have
clear
heads
she
said
it
was
impossible
to
listen
to
her
without
shuddering
for
me
if
he
stood
for
anything
halderschrodt
stood
for
stability
there
was
the
tremendous
name
and
there
was
the
person
i
had
just
seen
the
person
on
whom
a
habit
of
mind
approaching
almost
to
the
royal
had
conferred
a
presence
that
had
some
of
the
divinity
that
hedges
a
king
it
seemed
frightful
merely
to
imagine
his
ignominious
collapse
as
frightful
as
if
she
had
pointed
out
a
man
and
said
that
man
will
be
dead
in
five
minutes
that
indeed
was
what
she
said
of
halderschrodt
the
man
had
saluted
her
going
to
his
death
the
austere
inclination
that
i
had
seen
had
been
the
salutation
of
such
a
man
i
was
so
moved
by
one
thing
and
another
that
i
hardly
noticed
that
gurnard
had
come
into
the
room
i
had
not
seen
him
since
the
night
when
he
had
dined
with
the
duc
de
mersch
at
churchill
but
he
seemed
so
part
of
the
emotion
of
the
frame
of
mind
that
he
slid
noiselessly
into
the
scene
and
hardly
surprised
me
i
was
called
out
of
the
room
someone
desired
to
see
me
and
i
passed
without
any
transition
of
feeling
into
the
presence
of
an
entire
stranger
a
man
who
remains
a
voice
to
me
he
began
to
talk
to
me
about
the
state
of
my
aunt
health
he
said
she
was
breaking
up
that
he
begged
respectfully
to
urge
that
i
would
use
my
influence
to
take
her
back
to
london
to
consult
sir
james
i
perhaps
living
in
the
house
and
not
having
known
my
aunt
for
very
long
might
not
see
but
he
he
was
my
aunt
solicitor
he
was
quite
right
my
aunt
breaking
up
she
had
declined
visibly
in
the
few
hours
that
i
had
been
away
from
her
she
had
been
doing
business
with
this
man
had
altered
her
will
had
seen
gurnard
and
in
some
way
had
received
a
shock
that
seemed
to
have
deprived
her
of
all
volition
she
sat
with
her
head
leaning
back
her
eyes
closed
the
lines
of
her
face
all
seeming
to
run
downward
it
is
obvious
to
me
that
arrangements
ought
to
be
made
for
your
return
to
england
the
lawyer
said
whatever
engagements
miss
granger
or
etchingham
granger
or
even
gurnard
may
have
made
i
wondered
vaguely
what
the
devil
gurnard
could
have
to
say
in
the
matter
and
then
miss
granger
herself
came
into
the
room
they
want
me
my
aunt
said
in
a
low
voice
they
have
been
persuading
me
to
go
back
to
etchingham
i
think
you
said
meredith
i
became
conscious
that
i
wanted
to
return
to
england
wanted
it
very
much
wanted
to
be
out
of
this
to
get
somewhere
where
there
was
stability
and
things
that
one
could
understand
everything
here
seemed
to
be
in
a
mist
with
the
ground
trembling
underfoot
why
miss
granger
verdict
came
we
can
go
when
you
like
things
immediately
began
to
shape
themselves
on
these
unexpected
lines
a
sort
of
bustle
of
departure
to
be
in
the
air
i
was
employed
to
conduct
the
lawyer
as
far
as
the
porter
lodge
a
longish
traverse
he
beguiled
the
way
by
excusing
himself
for
hurrying
back
to
london
i
might
have
been
of
use
in
these
hurried
departures
there
are
generally
things
but
you
will
understand
etchingham
at
a
time
like
this
i
could
hardly
spare
the
hours
that
it
cost
me
to
come
over
you
would
be
astonished
what
a
deal
of
extra
work
it
gives
and
how
the
evil
is
people
seem
to
have
gone
mad
even
i
have
been
astonished
i
had
no
idea
i
said
of
course
not
of
course
not
no
one
had
but
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
there
will
have
to
be
an
enquiry
and
people
will
be
very
lucky
who
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
gathered
that
things
were
in
a
bad
way
over
there
as
over
here
that
there
were
scandals
and
a
tremendous
outcry
for
purification
in
the
highest
places
i
saw
the
man
get
into
his
fiacre
and
took
my
way
back
across
the
rather
slowly
pondering
over
the
part
i
was
to
fill
in
the
emigration
wondering
how
far
events
had
conferred
on
me
a
partnership
in
the
family
affairs
i
found
that
my
tacitly
acknowledged
function
was
that
of
supervising
the
sort
of
thing
that
made
for
personal
tenderness
in
the
aridity
of
profuse
hired
help
i
was
expected
to
arrange
a
rug
just
a
more
comfortably
than
the
lady
maid
who
would
travel
in
the
compartment
to
give
the
finishing
touches
it
was
astonishing
how
well
the
thing
was
engineered
the
removal
i
mean
it
gave
me
an
even
better
idea
of
the
woman
my
aunt
had
been
than
even
the
panic
of
her
solicitor
the
thing
went
as
smoothly
as
the
disappearance
of
a
caravan
of
gypsies
camped
for
the
night
on
a
heath
beside
gorse
bushes
we
went
to
the
ball
that
night
as
if
from
a
household
that
had
its
roots
deep
in
the
solid
rock
and
in
the
morning
we
had
disappeared
the
ball
itself
was
a
finishing
touch
the
finishing
touch
of
my
sister
affairs
and
the
end
of
my
patience
i
spent
an
interminable
night
one
of
those
nights
that
never
end
and
that
remain
quivering
and
raw
in
the
memory
i
seemed
to
be
in
a
blaze
of
light
watching
through
a
shifting
screen
of
shimmering
dresses
her
and
the
duc
de
mersch
i
do
know
whether
the
thing
was
really
noticeable
but
it
seemed
that
everyone
was
that
everyone
must
be
remarking
it
i
thought
i
caught
women
making
remarks
behind
fans
men
answering
inaudibly
with
eyes
discreetly
on
the
ground
it
was
a
mixed
assembly
somebody
liquidation
of
social
obligations
and
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
the
kind
of
people
who
do
make
remarks
it
was
not
the
noticeability
for
its
own
sake
that
i
hated
but
the
fact
that
their
relations
by
their
noticeability
made
me
impossible
whilst
the
notice
itself
confirmed
my
own
fears
i
hung
glowering
in
corners
noticeable
enough
myself
i
suppose
the
thing
reached
a
crisis
late
in
the
evening
there
was
a
kind
of
that
one
strolled
in
a
place
of
giant
palms
stretching
up
into
a
darkness
of
intense
shadow
i
was
prowling
about
in
the
shadows
of
great
metallic
leaves
cursing
under
my
breath
in
a
fury
of
nervous
irritation
quivering
like
a
horse
martyrised
by
a
stupidly
merciless
driver
i
happened
to
stand
back
for
a
moment
in
the
narrowest
of
paths
with
the
touch
of
spiky
leaves
on
my
hand
and
on
my
face
in
front
of
me
was
the
glaring
perspective
of
one
of
the
longer
alleys
and
stepping
into
it
a
great
band
of
blue
ribbon
cutting
across
his
chest
came
de
mersch
with
her
upon
his
arm
de
mersch
himself
hardly
counted
he
had
a
way
of
glowing
but
he
paled
ineffectual
fires
beside
her
mænadic
glow
there
was
something
overpowering
in
the
sight
of
her
in
the
fire
of
her
eyes
in
the
glow
of
her
coils
of
hair
in
the
poise
of
her
head
she
wore
some
kind
of
early
dress
sweeping
low
from
the
waist
with
a
tenderness
of
fold
that
affected
one
with
delicate
pathos
that
had
a
virgin
quality
of
almost
poignant
intensity
and
beneath
it
she
stepped
with
the
buoyancy
the
long
steps
of
a
triumphing
diana
it
was
more
than
terrible
for
me
to
stand
there
longing
with
a
black
baffled
longing
with
some
of
the
base
quality
of
an
eavesdropper
and
all
the
baseness
of
the
unsuccessful
then
gurnard
loomed
in
the
distance
moving
insensibly
down
the
long
glaring
corridor
a
sinister
figure
suggesting
in
the
silence
of
his
oncoming
the
motionless
flight
of
a
vulture
well
within
my
field
of
sight
he
overtook
them
and
with
a
lack
of
preliminary
greeting
that
suggested
supreme
intimacy
walked
beside
them
i
stood
for
some
moments
for
some
minutes
and
then
hastened
after
them
i
was
going
to
do
something
after
a
time
i
found
de
mersch
and
gurnard
standing
facing
each
other
in
one
of
the
doorways
of
the
place
gurnard
a
small
dark
impassive
column
de
mersch
bulky
overwhelming
florid
standing
with
his
legs
well
apart
and
speaking
vociferously
with
a
good
deal
of
gesture
i
approached
them
from
the
side
standing
rather
insistently
at
his
elbow
i
want
i
said
i
would
be
extremely
glad
if
you
would
give
me
a
minute
monsieur
i
was
conscious
that
i
spoke
with
a
tremour
of
the
voice
a
sort
of
throaty
eagerness
i
was
unaware
of
what
course
i
was
to
pursue
but
i
was
confident
of
calmness
of
i
was
equal
to
that
they
had
a
pause
of
surprised
silence
gurnard
wheeled
and
fixed
me
critically
with
his
i
took
de
mersch
a
little
apart
into
a
solitude
of
palm
branches
and
began
to
speak
before
he
had
asked
me
my
errand
you
must
understand
that
i
would
not
interfere
without
a
good
deal
of
provocation
i
was
saying
when
he
cut
me
short
speaking
in
a
thick
jovial
voice
oh
we
will
understand
that
my
good
granger
and
then
it
is
about
my
sister
i
said
you
you
go
too
far
i
must
ask
you
as
a
gentleman
to
cease
persecuting
her
he
answered
the
devil
and
then
if
i
do
not
it
was
evident
in
his
voice
in
his
manner
that
the
man
was
a
little
well
if
you
do
not
i
said
i
shall
forbid
her
to
see
you
and
i
shall
oh
oh
he
interjected
with
the
intonation
of
a
reveller
at
a
farce
we
are
at
that
we
are
the
excellent
brother
he
paused
and
then
added
well
go
to
the
devil
you
and
your
forbidding
he
spoke
with
the
greatest
good
humour
i
am
in
earnest
i
said
very
much
in
earnest
the
thing
has
gone
too
far
and
even
for
your
own
sake
you
had
better
he
said
ah
ah
in
the
tone
of
his
oh
oh
she
is
no
friend
to
you
i
struggled
on
she
is
playing
with
you
for
her
own
purposes
you
will
he
swayed
a
little
on
his
feet
and
said
bravo
bravissimo
if
we
ca
forbid
him
we
will
frighten
him
go
on
my
good
fellow
and
then
come
go
on
i
looked
at
his
great
bulk
of
a
body
it
came
into
my
head
dimly
that
i
wanted
him
to
strike
me
to
give
me
an
excuse
anything
to
end
the
scene
violently
with
a
crash
and
exclamations
of
fury
you
absolutely
refuse
to
pay
any
attention
i
said
oh
absolutely
he
answered
you
know
that
i
can
do
something
that
i
can
expose
you
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
i
could
that
the
number
of
small
things
that
i
knew
to
his
discredit
and
the
mass
of
my
hatred
could
be
welded
into
a
damning
whole
he
laughed
a
hysterical
laugh
the
dawn
was
beginning
to
spread
pallidly
above
us
gleaming
mournfully
through
the
glass
of
the
people
began
to
pass
muffled
up
on
their
way
out
of
the
place
you
may
go
he
was
beginning
but
the
expression
of
his
face
altered
miss
granger
muffled
up
like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
was
coming
out
of
the
inner
door
we
have
been
having
a
charming
he
began
to
her
she
touched
me
gently
on
the
arm
come
arthur
she
said
and
then
to
him
you
have
heard
the
news
he
looked
at
her
rather
muzzily
baron
halderschrodt
has
committed
suicide
she
said
come
arthur
we
passed
on
slowly
but
de
mersch
followed
you
you
are
in
he
said
catching
at
her
arm
so
that
we
swung
round
and
faced
him
there
was
a
sort
of
mad
entreaty
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
hoped
that
by
unsaying
she
could
remedy
an
irremediable
disaster
and
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
but
those
beseeching
eyes
monsieur
de
sabran
told
me
she
answered
he
had
just
come
from
making
the
besides
you
can
hear
came
to
our
ears
from
groups
that
passed
us
a
very
old
man
with
a
nose
that
almost
touched
his
thick
lips
was
saying
to
another
of
the
same
type
shot
himself
through
the
left
temple
de
mersch
walked
slowly
down
the
long
corridor
away
from
us
there
was
an
extraordinary
stiffness
in
his
gait
as
if
he
were
trying
to
emulate
the
goose
step
of
his
days
in
the
prussian
guard
my
companion
looked
after
him
as
though
she
wished
to
gauge
the
extent
of
his
despair
you
would
say
would
you
she
asked
me
i
thought
we
had
seen
the
last
of
him
but
as
in
the
twilight
of
the
dawn
we
waited
for
the
lodge
gates
to
open
a
furious
clatter
of
hoofs
came
down
the
long
street
and
a
carriage
drew
level
with
ours
a
moment
after
de
mersch
was
knocking
at
our
window
you
will
you
will
he
stuttered
speak
to
gurnard
that
is
our
only
chance
now
his
voice
came
in
mingled
with
the
cold
air
of
the
morning
i
shivered
you
have
so
much
power
with
him
and
oh
i
she
answered
the
thing
must
go
through
he
said
again
or
else
he
paused
the
great
gates
in
front
of
us
swung
noiselessly
open
one
saw
into
the
the
light
was
growing
stronger
she
did
not
answer
i
tell
you
he
asseverated
insistently
if
the
british
government
abandons
my
railway
our
plans
oh
the
government
wo
it
she
said
with
a
little
emphasis
on
the
verb
he
stepped
back
out
of
range
of
the
wheels
and
we
turned
in
and
left
him
standing
there
in
the
great
room
which
was
usually
given
up
to
the
political
plotters
stood
a
table
covered
with
eatables
and
lit
by
a
pair
of
candles
in
tall
silver
sticks
i
was
conscious
of
a
raging
hunger
and
of
a
fierce
excitement
that
made
the
thought
of
sleep
part
of
a
past
of
phantoms
i
began
to
eat
unconsciously
pacing
up
and
down
the
while
she
was
standing
beside
the
table
in
the
glow
of
the
transparent
light
pallid
blue
lines
showed
in
the
long
windows
it
was
very
cold
and
hideously
late
away
in
those
endless
small
hours
when
the
pulse
drags
when
the
drags
when
time
is
effaced
you
see
she
said
suddenly
oh
i
see
i
answered
and
and
now
now
we
are
almost
done
with
each
other
she
answered
i
felt
a
sudden
mental
falling
away
i
had
never
looked
at
things
in
that
way
had
never
really
looked
things
in
the
face
i
had
grown
so
used
to
the
idea
that
she
was
to
parcel
out
the
remainder
of
my
life
had
grown
so
used
to
the
feeling
that
i
was
the
integral
portion
of
her
life
but
i
i
said
what
is
to
become
of
me
she
stood
looking
down
at
the
ground
for
a
long
time
at
last
she
said
in
a
low
monotone
oh
you
must
try
to
forget
a
new
idea
struck
me
luminously
overwhelming
i
grew
reckless
you
you
are
growing
considerate
i
taunted
you
are
not
so
sure
not
so
cold
i
notice
a
change
in
you
upon
my
soul
her
eyes
dilated
suddenly
and
as
suddenly
closed
again
she
said
nothing
i
grew
conscious
of
unbearable
pain
the
pain
of
returning
life
she
was
going
away
i
should
be
alone
the
future
began
to
exist
again
looming
up
like
a
vessel
through
thick
mist
silent
phantasmal
overwhelming
a
hideous
future
of
irremediable
remorse
of
solitude
of
craving
you
are
going
back
to
work
with
churchill
she
said
suddenly
how
did
you
know
i
asked
breathlessly
my
despair
of
a
sort
found
vent
in
violent
interjecting
of
an
immaterial
query
you
leave
your
letters
about
she
said
and
it
will
be
best
for
you
it
will
not
i
said
bitterly
it
could
never
be
the
same
i
want
to
see
churchill
i
want
you
want
she
asked
in
a
low
monotone
you
i
answered
she
spoke
at
last
very
slowly
oh
as
for
me
i
am
going
to
marry
gurnard
i
do
know
just
what
i
said
then
but
i
remember
that
i
found
myself
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
phrases
running
metrically
up
and
down
my
mind
you
could
marry
gurnard
you
do
know
what
he
is
you
could
marry
gurnard
you
do
know
what
he
is
i
do
suppose
that
i
knew
anything
to
the
discredit
of
gurnard
but
he
struck
me
in
that
way
at
that
moment
struck
me
convincingly
more
than
any
array
of
facts
could
have
done
oh
as
for
what
he
is
she
said
and
paused
know
and
then
suddenly
she
began
to
speak
very
fast
do
you
see
you
see
that
i
do
marry
gurnard
for
what
he
is
in
that
sense
but
for
what
he
is
in
the
other
it
is
a
marriage
in
your
sense
at
all
and
and
it
does
affect
you
do
you
we
have
to
have
done
with
one
another
because
because
i
had
an
inspiration
i
believe
i
said
very
slowly
i
believe
you
care
she
said
nothing
you
care
i
repeated
she
spoke
then
with
an
energy
that
had
something
of
a
threat
in
it
do
you
think
i
would
do
you
think
i
could
or
dare
do
you
understand
she
faltered
but
then
she
added
and
was
silent
for
a
long
minute
i
felt
the
throb
of
a
thousand
pulses
in
my
head
on
my
temples
oh
yes
i
care
she
said
slowly
but
that
that
makes
it
all
the
worse
why
yes
i
care
yes
yes
it
hurts
me
to
see
you
i
might
it
would
draw
me
away
i
have
my
allotted
course
and
you
do
you
see
you
would
influence
me
you
would
be
you
a
disease
for
me
but
i
said
i
could
i
would
do
anything
i
had
only
the
faintest
of
ideas
of
what
i
would
do
for
her
sake
ah
no
she
said
you
must
not
say
that
you
do
understand
even
that
would
mean
misery
for
you
and
i
i
could
not
bear
do
you
see
even
now
before
you
have
done
your
allotted
part
i
am
wanting
oh
wanting
to
let
you
go
but
i
must
not
i
must
not
you
must
go
on
and
bear
it
for
a
little
while
more
and
then
there
was
a
tension
somewhere
a
string
somewhere
that
was
stretched
tight
and
vibrating
i
was
tremulous
with
an
excitement
that
overmastered
my
powers
of
speech
that
surpassed
my
understanding
do
you
see
she
asked
again
you
are
the
past
the
passing
we
could
never
meet
you
are
for
me
only
the
portrait
of
a
man
of
a
man
who
has
been
dead
oh
a
long
time
and
i
for
you
only
a
possibility
a
conception
you
work
to
bring
me
on
to
make
me
possible
but
i
said
the
idea
was
so
difficult
to
grasp
i
will
there
must
be
a
way
no
she
answered
there
is
no
way
you
must
go
back
must
try
there
will
be
churchill
and
what
he
stands
for
he
wo
die
he
wo
even
care
much
for
losing
this
game
not
much
and
you
will
have
to
forget
me
there
is
no
other
way
no
bridge
we
ca
meet
you
and
i
the
words
goaded
me
to
fury
i
began
to
pace
furiously
up
and
down
i
wanted
to
tell
her
that
i
would
throw
away
everything
for
her
would
crush
myself
out
would
be
a
lifeless
tool
would
do
anything
but
i
could
tear
no
words
out
of
the
stone
that
seemed
to
surround
me
you
may
even
tell
him
if
you
like
what
i
and
gurnard
are
going
to
do
it
will
make
no
difference
he
will
fall
but
you
would
like
him
to
to
make
a
good
fight
for
it
would
you
that
is
all
i
can
do
for
your
sake
i
began
to
speak
as
if
i
had
not
spoken
for
years
the
house
seemed
to
be
coming
to
life
there
were
noises
of
opening
doors
of
voices
outside
i
believe
you
care
enough
i
said
to
give
it
all
up
for
me
i
believe
you
do
and
i
want
you
i
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
the
noises
of
returning
day
grew
loud
frightfully
loud
it
was
as
if
i
must
hasten
must
get
said
what
i
had
to
say
as
if
i
must
raise
my
voice
to
make
it
heard
amid
the
clamour
of
a
world
awakening
to
life
i
believe
you
do
i
believe
you
do
i
said
again
and
again
and
i
want
you
my
voice
rose
higher
and
higher
she
stood
motionless
an
inscrutable
white
figure
like
some
silent
greek
statue
a
harmony
of
falling
folds
of
heavy
drapery
perfectly
motionless
i
want
you
i
said
i
want
you
i
want
you
i
want
you
it
was
unbearable
to
myself
oh
be
quiet
she
said
at
last
be
quiet
if
you
had
wanted
me
i
have
been
here
it
is
too
late
all
these
days
all
these
but
i
said
from
without
someone
opened
the
great
shutters
of
the
windows
and
the
light
from
the
outside
world
burst
in
upon
us
chapter
fifteen
we
parted
in
london
next
day
i
hardly
know
where
she
seemed
so
part
of
my
being
was
for
me
so
little
more
than
an
intellectual
force
so
little
of
a
physical
personality
that
i
can
not
remember
where
my
eyes
lost
sight
of
her
i
had
desolately
made
the
crossing
from
country
to
country
had
convoyed
my
aunt
to
her
big
house
in
one
of
the
gloomy
squares
in
a
certain
district
and
then
we
had
parted
even
afterward
it
was
as
if
she
were
still
beside
me
as
if
i
had
only
to
look
round
to
find
her
eyes
upon
me
she
remained
the
propelling
force
i
a
boat
thrust
out
upon
a
moving
more
and
more
slowly
i
had
been
for
so
long
in
the
shadow
of
that
great
house
shut
in
among
the
gloom
that
all
this
light
this
blazing
world
it
was
a
june
day
in
london
seemed
impossible
and
hateful
over
there
there
had
been
nothing
but
very
slow
fading
minutes
now
there
was
a
past
a
future
it
was
as
if
i
stood
between
them
in
a
cleft
of
unscalable
rocks
i
went
about
mechanically
made
arrangements
for
my
housing
moved
in
and
out
of
rooms
in
the
enormous
mausoleum
of
a
club
that
was
all
the
home
i
had
in
a
sort
of
stupor
suddenly
i
remembered
that
i
had
been
thinking
of
something
that
she
had
been
talking
of
churchill
i
had
had
a
letter
from
him
on
the
morning
of
the
day
before
when
i
read
it
churchill
and
his
had
risen
in
my
mind
like
preposterous
phantoms
the
one
as
unreal
as
the
other
as
alien
i
seemed
to
have
passed
an
infinity
of
æons
beyond
them
the
one
and
the
other
belonged
as
absolutely
to
the
past
as
a
past
year
belongs
the
thought
of
them
did
not
bring
with
it
the
tremulously
unpleasant
sensations
that
as
a
rule
come
with
the
thoughts
of
a
too
recent
but
rather
as
a
vein
of
rose
across
a
gray
evening
i
had
passed
his
letter
over
had
dropped
it
among
the
litter
of
the
others
then
there
had
seemed
to
be
a
haven
into
whose
mouth
i
was
drifting
now
i
should
have
to
pick
the
letters
up
again
all
of
them
set
to
work
desolately
to
pick
up
the
threads
of
the
past
and
work
it
back
into
life
as
one
does
things
i
set
about
it
listlessly
there
remained
of
that
time
an
errand
for
my
aunt
an
errand
that
would
take
me
to
etchingham
something
connected
with
her
land
steward
i
think
the
old
lady
had
ideas
of
inducting
me
into
a
position
that
it
had
grown
tacitly
acknowledged
i
was
to
fill
i
was
to
go
down
there
to
see
about
some
alterations
that
were
in
progress
and
to
make
arrangements
for
my
aunt
return
i
was
so
tired
so
dog
tired
and
the
day
still
had
so
many
weary
hours
to
run
that
i
recognised
instinctively
that
if
i
were
to
come
through
it
sane
i
must
tire
myself
more
must
keep
on
going
until
i
sank
i
drifted
down
to
etchingham
that
evening
i
sent
a
messenger
over
to
churchill
cottage
waited
for
an
answer
that
told
me
that
churchill
was
there
and
then
slept
and
slept
i
woke
back
in
the
world
again
in
a
world
that
contained
the
land
steward
and
the
manor
house
i
had
a
sense
of
recovered
power
from
the
sight
of
them
of
the
sunlight
on
the
stretches
of
turf
of
the
mellow
golden
stonework
of
the
long
range
of
buildings
from
the
sound
of
a
chime
of
bells
that
came
wonderfully
sweetly
over
the
soft
swelling
of
the
close
turf
the
feeling
came
not
from
any
sense
of
prospective
ownership
but
from
the
acute
consciousness
of
what
these
things
stood
for
i
did
not
recognise
it
then
but
later
i
understood
for
the
present
it
was
enough
to
have
again
the
power
to
set
my
foot
on
the
ground
heel
first
in
the
streets
of
the
little
town
there
was
a
sensation
of
holiday
not
pronounced
enough
to
call
for
flags
but
enough
to
convey
the
idea
of
waiting
for
an
event
the
land
steward
at
the
end
of
a
tour
amongst
cottages
explained
there
was
to
be
a
celebration
in
the
neighbourhood
a
show
with
a
political
annex
the
latter
under
the
auspices
of
miss
churchill
churchill
himself
was
to
speak
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
pronouncement
i
found
london
reporters
at
my
inn
men
i
half
knew
they
expressed
mitigated
delight
at
the
view
of
me
and
over
a
let
me
know
what
one
said
what
one
said
of
the
outside
of
events
i
knew
too
well
internally
they
most
of
them
had
the
air
of
my
solicitor
when
he
had
said
even
i
did
not
realise
their
positions
saving
them
the
necessity
of
concealing
surprise
one
ca
know
they
fumbled
amusingly
about
the
causes
differed
with
one
another
but
were
surprisingly
unanimous
as
to
effects
as
to
the
panic
and
the
call
for
purification
it
was
rather
extraordinary
too
how
large
de
mersch
loomed
on
the
horizon
over
here
it
was
as
if
the
whole
world
centred
in
him
as
if
he
represented
the
modern
spirit
that
must
be
purified
away
by
burning
before
things
could
return
to
their
normal
state
i
knew
what
he
represented
but
there
it
was
it
was
part
of
my
programme
the
attendance
at
the
poultry
show
i
was
to
go
back
to
the
cottage
with
churchill
after
he
had
made
his
speech
it
was
rather
extraordinary
the
sensations
of
that
function
i
went
in
rather
late
with
the
reporter
of
the
who
was
anxious
to
do
me
the
favour
of
introducing
me
without
payment
it
was
his
way
of
making
himself
pleasant
and
i
had
the
reputation
of
knowing
celebrities
it
rather
extraordinary
to
be
back
again
in
the
midst
of
this
sort
of
thing
to
be
walking
over
a
crowded
green
paddock
hedged
in
with
tall
trees
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
the
gaily
striped
species
of
tent
that
is
called
marquee
and
the
type
of
face
and
the
style
of
the
costume
they
would
have
seemed
impossible
the
day
before
yesterday
there
were
all
miss
churchill
gang
of
great
dames
muslin
rustling
marriageable
daughters
a
continual
twitter
of
voices
and
a
sprinkling
of
the
peasantry
and
struck
speechless
one
of
the
great
ladies
surveyed
me
as
i
stood
in
the
centre
of
an
open
space
surveyed
me
through
glasses
on
the
end
of
a
long
handle
and
beckoned
me
to
her
side
you
are
unattached
she
asked
she
had
pretensions
to
voice
the
county
just
as
my
aunt
undoubtedly
set
the
tone
of
its
doings
decided
who
was
visitable
and
just
as
miss
churchill
gave
the
political
tone
you
may
wait
upon
me
then
she
said
my
daughter
is
with
her
young
man
that
is
the
correct
phrase
is
it
not
she
was
a
great
lady
who
stood
nearly
six
foot
high
and
whom
one
would
have
styled
buxom
had
one
dared
i
have
a
grievance
she
went
on
i
must
talk
to
someone
come
this
way
she
pointed
with
the
handle
of
her
glasses
to
a
pen
of
glossy
blackbirds
you
see
not
even
commended
and
i
assure
you
the
trouble
i
have
taken
over
them
with
the
idea
of
setting
an
example
to
the
tenantry
is
incredible
they
give
a
prize
to
one
of
our
own
tenants
which
is
as
much
as
telling
the
man
that
he
is
an
example
to
then
they
wonder
that
the
country
is
going
to
the
dogs
i
assure
you
that
after
breakfast
i
have
had
the
scraps
collected
from
the
plates
that
was
the
course
recommended
by
the
poultry
manuals
and
have
taken
them
out
with
my
own
hands
the
sort
of
thing
passed
for
humour
in
the
county
and
being
delivered
with
an
air
and
a
half
irish
ruefulness
passed
well
enough
and
that
reminds
me
she
went
on
i
mean
the
fact
that
the
country
is
going
to
the
dogs
as
my
husband
you
have
seen
him
anywhere
have
you
he
is
one
of
the
judges
and
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
him
about
my
orpingtons
says
every
morning
after
he
has
looked
at
his
paper
that
oh
that
you
have
been
in
paris
have
you
with
your
aunt
then
of
course
you
have
seen
this
famous
duc
de
mersch
she
looked
at
me
humourously
through
her
glasses
i
going
to
pump
you
you
know
she
said
it
is
the
duty
that
is
expected
of
me
i
have
to
talk
for
a
countyful
of
women
without
a
tongue
in
their
heads
so
tell
me
about
him
is
it
true
that
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
mischief
is
it
through
him
that
this
man
committed
suicide
they
say
so
he
mixed
up
in
that
royalist
plot
was
he
and
the
people
that
have
been
failing
all
over
the
place
mixed
up
with
him
are
they
i
i
really
do
know
i
said
if
you
say
so
oh
i
assure
you
i
sound
enough
she
answered
the
churchills
i
know
you
a
friend
of
his
have
a
stauncher
ally
than
i
am
and
i
should
only
be
too
glad
to
be
able
to
contradict
but
it
so
difficult
i
assure
you
i
go
out
of
my
way
talk
to
the
most
outrageous
people
deny
the
very
possibility
of
churchill
being
in
any
way
implicated
one
knows
that
it
impossible
but
what
can
one
do
i
have
said
again
and
again
to
people
like
grocers
wives
even
to
the
grocers
for
that
matter
that
churchill
is
a
statesman
and
that
if
he
insists
that
this
odious
man
railway
must
go
through
it
is
in
the
interests
of
the
country
that
it
should
i
tell
them
she
paused
for
a
minute
to
take
breath
and
then
went
on
i
was
speaking
to
a
man
of
that
class
only
this
morning
rather
an
intelligent
man
and
quite
nice
i
was
saying
you
see
my
dear
tull
that
it
is
a
question
of
international
politics
if
the
grand
duke
does
not
get
the
money
for
his
railway
the
grand
duke
will
be
turned
out
of
his
what
is
it
principality
and
that
would
be
most
dangerous
in
the
present
condition
of
affairs
over
there
and
besides
the
man
listened
very
respectfully
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
not
convinced
i
buckled
to
again
besides
i
said
is
the
question
of
greenland
itself
we
english
must
have
greenland
sooner
or
later
it
touches
you
even
you
have
a
son
who
above
who
does
care
for
life
in
a
country
town
and
you
want
to
send
him
abroad
with
a
little
capital
well
greenland
is
just
the
place
for
him
the
man
looked
at
me
and
almost
shook
his
head
in
my
face
you
excuse
me
my
lady
he
said
wo
do
churchill
is
a
man
above
well
i
know
it
that
have
had
dealings
with
him
but
well
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
my
lady
that
you
ca
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
or
leastwise
people
think
you
been
defiled
those
that
do
know
you
the
foreign
nations
are
all
very
well
and
the
grand
duchy
and
the
getting
hold
of
greenland
but
what
touches
me
is
this
my
neighbour
slingsby
had
a
little
money
and
he
gets
a
prospectus
it
looked
very
well
very
well
and
he
brings
it
in
to
me
i
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
slingsby
did
well
now
there
slingsby
on
the
rates
and
his
wife
a
lady
born
almost
i
might
have
been
taken
in
the
same
way
but
for
for
the
grace
of
god
i
minded
to
say
well
slingsby
a
good
man
and
used
to
be
a
man
all
his
life
and
now
it
turns
out
that
that
prospectus
came
about
by
the
man
de
mersch
manoeuvres
schemes
they
call
them
in
the
paper
that
i
read
and
there
any
number
of
them
started
by
de
mersch
or
his
agents
just
for
what
that
de
mersch
may
be
the
richest
man
in
the
world
and
a
philanthropist
well
then
where
slingsby
if
that
philanthropy
so
churchill
comes
along
and
says
in
a
manner
of
speaking
that
all
very
well
but
this
same
mersch
is
the
grand
duke
of
somewhere
or
other
and
we
must
bolster
him
up
in
his
kingdom
or
else
there
will
be
trouble
with
the
powers
powers
what
powers
to
me
or
greenland
when
slingsby
a
man
i
smoked
a
pipe
with
every
market
evening
of
my
life
in
the
workhouse
and
there
hundreds
of
slingsbys
all
over
the
country
the
man
was
working
himself
slingsby
a
good
sort
of
man
it
shocked
even
me
one
knows
what
goes
on
in
one
own
village
of
course
and
it
only
too
true
that
there
hundreds
of
slingsbys
i
not
boring
you
am
i
i
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
i
i
had
no
idea
i
said
i
have
been
so
long
out
of
it
and
over
there
one
did
not
realise
the
the
feeling
you
been
well
out
of
it
she
answered
one
has
had
to
suffer
i
assure
you
i
believed
that
she
had
had
to
suffer
it
must
have
taken
a
good
deal
to
make
that
lady
complain
her
large
ruddy
features
followed
the
droop
of
her
eyes
down
to
the
fringe
of
the
parasol
that
she
was
touching
the
turf
with
we
were
sitting
on
garden
seats
in
the
dappled
shade
of
enormous
elms
there
was
in
the
air
a
touch
of
the
sounds
discoursed
by
a
yeomanry
band
at
the
other
end
of
the
grounds
one
could
see
the
red
of
their
uniforms
through
moving
rifts
in
the
crowd
of
white
dresses
that
was
even
the
worst
she
said
suddenly
lifting
her
eyes
and
looking
away
between
the
trunks
of
the
trees
the
man
has
been
reading
the
papers
and
he
gave
me
the
benefit
of
his
reflections
got
to
be
punished
for
this
he
said
got
to
show
them
that
you
ca
be
with
that
sort
of
blackguard
without
paying
for
it
i
do
say
mind
you
that
churchill
is
or
ever
has
been
i
know
him
and
i
trust
him
but
there
more
than
me
in
the
world
and
they
ca
all
know
him
well
here
the
papers
saying
or
they
say
it
but
they
hint
which
is
worse
in
a
way
that
he
must
be
or
he
would
stick
up
for
the
man
they
say
the
man
a
blackguard
out
and
out
in
greenland
too
has
the
blacks
murdered
churchill
says
the
blacks
are
to
be
that
the
word
well
they
may
be
but
so
ought
slingsby
to
have
been
yet
it
did
help
him
no
my
lady
we
got
to
put
our
own
house
in
order
and
that
first
before
thinking
of
the
powers
or
places
like
greenland
what
the
good
of
the
saner
policy
that
churchill
talks
about
if
you
ca
trust
anyone
with
your
money
and
have
to
live
on
the
capital
if
you
ca
sleep
at
night
for
thinking
that
you
may
be
in
the
workhouse
like
slingsby
the
first
duty
of
men
in
churchill
position
as
i
see
it
is
to
see
that
we
able
to
be
confident
of
honest
dealing
that
what
we
want
not
greenlands
that
how
we
all
feel
and
you
know
it
too
or
else
you
a
great
lady
would
stop
to
talk
to
a
man
like
me
and
mind
you
i
true
blue
always
have
been
and
always
shall
be
and
if
it
was
a
matter
of
votes
i
give
mine
to
churchill
but
there
a
many
that
would
there
a
many
that
believe
the
hintings
my
lady
stopped
and
sighed
from
a
broad
bosom
what
could
i
say
she
went
on
again
i
know
churchill
and
i
like
him
and
everyone
that
knows
him
likes
him
i
one
of
the
stalwarts
mind
you
i
not
for
giving
in
to
popular
clamour
i
for
the
policy
like
churchill
but
as
the
man
said
a
many
that
believe
the
hintings
and
i
almost
wish
churchill
however
you
understand
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
one
had
had
to
suffer
oh
i
understand
i
said
i
was
beginning
to
and
churchill
i
asked
later
he
gives
no
sign
of
relenting
would
you
have
him
she
asked
sharply
would
you
make
him
if
you
could
she
had
an
air
of
challenging
i
for
the
policy
cost
what
it
may
he
owes
it
to
himself
to
sacrifice
himself
if
it
comes
to
that
i
with
you
too
i
answered
over
boot
and
spur
her
enthusiasm
was
contagious
and
unnecessary
oh
he
stick
she
began
again
after
consultation
with
the
parasol
fringe
you
hear
him
after
a
minute
it
a
field
day
you
miss
the
other
heavy
guns
if
you
stop
with
me
i
do
it
ostentatiously
wait
until
they
done
they
all
trembling
all
of
them
my
husband
will
be
on
the
platform
trembling
too
he
is
a
type
of
them
all
day
long
and
at
odd
moments
at
night
i
talk
to
him
him
and
silence
him
what
the
state
of
popular
feeling
to
him
for
the
country
not
the
town
this
sort
of
thing
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
it
a
matter
to
be
settled
by
jews
in
the
city
well
he
sees
it
at
night
and
then
in
the
morning
the
papers
undo
all
my
work
he
begins
to
talk
about
his
seat
which
got
for
him
i
been
the
of
the
county
for
years
now
well
it
soon
be
a
voice
without
a
county
what
is
it
old
order
changeth
so
i
arranged
it
that
i
shall
wait
until
the
trembling
have
stuttered
their
speeches
out
and
then
i
going
to
sail
down
the
centre
aisle
and
listen
to
churchill
with
visible
signs
of
approval
it
wo
do
much
but
there
was
a
time
when
it
would
have
changed
the
course
of
an
election
ah
there
effie
young
man
it
time
she
rose
and
marched
with
the
air
of
going
to
a
last
sacrifice
across
the
deserted
sward
toward
a
young
man
who
was
passing
under
the
calico
flag
of
the
gateway
it
all
right
willoughby
she
said
as
we
drew
level
i
found
someone
else
to
face
the
music
with
me
you
can
go
back
to
effie
a
bronzed
and
grateful
young
man
murmured
thanks
to
me
it
an
awful
relief
granger
he
said
ca
think
how
you
can
do
it
i
hooked
but
you
he
the
better
man
his
said
over
her
shoulder
she
sailed
slowly
up
the
aisle
beside
me
an
almost
heroic
figure
of
a
matron
splendidly
timed
you
see
she
said
do
you
observe
my
husband
embarrassment
it
was
splendid
to
see
churchill
again
standing
there
negligently
with
the
diffidence
of
a
boy
amid
the
bustle
of
applause
i
understood
suddenly
why
i
loved
him
so
this
tall
gray
man
with
the
delicate
almost
grotesque
mannerisms
he
appealed
to
me
by
sheer
force
of
picturesqueness
appealed
as
some
forgotten
mediaeval
city
might
i
was
concerned
for
him
as
for
some
such
dying
place
standing
above
the
level
plains
i
was
jealous
lest
it
should
lose
one
jot
of
its
glory
of
its
renown
he
advocated
his
saner
policy
before
all
those
people
stood
up
there
and
spoke
gently
persuasively
without
any
stress
of
emotion
without
more
movement
than
an
occasional
flutter
of
the
glasses
he
held
in
his
hand
one
would
never
have
recognised
that
the
thing
was
a
fighting
speech
but
for
the
occasional
shiver
of
his
audience
they
were
thinking
of
their
slingsbys
he
affecting
insouciantly
to
treat
them
as
rational
people
it
was
extraordinary
to
sit
there
shut
in
by
that
wall
of
people
all
of
one
type
of
one
idea
the
idea
of
getting
back
all
conscious
that
a
force
of
which
they
knew
nothing
was
dragging
them
forward
over
the
edge
of
a
glacier
into
a
crevasse
they
wanted
to
get
back
were
struggling
panting
even
as
a
nation
pants
to
get
back
by
their
own
way
that
they
understood
and
saw
were
hauling
and
hauling
desperately
at
the
weighted
rope
that
was
dragging
them
forward
churchill
stood
up
there
and
repeated
mine
is
the
only
way
the
saner
policy
and
his
words
would
fly
all
over
the
country
to
fall
upon
the
deaf
ears
of
the
who
could
not
understand
the
use
of
calmness
of
trifling
even
in
the
face
of
danger
who
suspected
the
calmness
as
one
suspects
the
thing
one
has
not
at
the
end
of
it
i
received
his
summons
to
a
small
door
at
the
back
of
the
building
the
speech
seemed
to
have
passed
out
of
his
mind
far
more
than
out
of
mine
so
you
have
come
he
said
that
good
and
so
let
us
walk
a
little
way
out
of
this
my
aunt
will
pick
us
up
on
the
road
he
linked
his
arm
into
mine
and
propelled
me
swiftly
down
the
bright
broad
street
i
sorry
you
came
in
for
that
but
one
has
to
do
these
things
there
was
a
sort
of
resisted
numbness
in
his
voice
a
lack
of
any
resiliency
my
heart
sank
a
little
it
was
as
if
i
were
beside
an
invalid
who
did
not
must
not
know
his
condition
as
if
i
were
pledged
not
to
notice
anything
in
the
open
the
change
struck
home
as
a
hammer
strikes
in
the
pitiless
searching
of
the
unrestrained
light
his
grayness
his
tremulousness
his
aloofness
from
the
things
about
him
came
home
to
me
like
a
pang
you
look
a
bit
fagged
i
said
perhaps
we
ought
not
to
talk
about
work
his
thoughts
seemed
to
come
back
from
a
great
distance
oh
from
an
infinite
distance
beyond
the
horizon
the
soft
hills
of
that
fat
country
you
want
rest
i
added
i
oh
no
he
answered
i
ca
have
it
till
the
end
of
the
session
i
used
to
it
too
he
began
talking
briskly
about
the
proofs
had
emerged
from
the
infinite
and
wanted
attention
there
were
innumerable
little
matters
things
to
be
copied
for
the
appendix
and
revisions
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
keep
my
mind
upon
them
it
had
come
suddenly
home
to
me
that
this
was
the
world
that
i
belonged
to
that
i
had
come
back
to
it
as
if
from
an
under
world
that
to
this
i
owed
allegiance
she
herself
had
recognised
that
she
herself
had
bidden
me
tell
him
what
was
against
him
it
was
a
duty
too
he
was
my
friend
but
face
to
face
with
him
it
became
almost
an
impossibility
it
was
impossible
even
to
put
it
into
words
the
mere
ideas
seemed
to
be
untranslatable
to
savour
of
madness
i
found
myself
in
the
very
position
that
she
had
occupied
at
the
commencement
of
our
relations
that
of
having
to
explain
say
to
a
persian
the
working
principles
of
the
telegraph
and
i
was
not
equal
to
the
task
at
the
same
time
i
had
to
do
something
i
had
to
it
would
be
abominable
to
have
to
go
through
life
forever
alone
with
the
consciousness
of
that
sort
of
treachery
of
silence
but
how
could
i
tell
him
even
the
comprehensibles
what
kind
of
sentence
was
i
to
open
with
with
pluckings
of
an
apologetic
string
without
prelude
at
all
or
how
i
grew
conscious
that
there
was
need
for
haste
he
was
looking
behind
him
down
the
long
white
road
for
the
carriage
that
was
to
pick
us
up
my
dear
fellow
i
began
he
must
have
noted
a
change
in
my
tone
and
looked
at
me
with
suddenly
lifted
eyebrows
you
know
my
sister
is
going
to
marry
mr
gurnard
why
no
he
answered
that
is
i
heard
he
began
to
offer
good
wishes
no
no
i
interrupted
him
hurriedly
not
that
but
i
happen
to
know
that
gurnard
is
meditating
is
going
to
separate
from
you
in
public
matters
an
expression
of
dismay
spread
over
his
face
my
dear
fellow
he
began
oh
i
not
drunk
i
said
bitterly
but
i
been
behind
the
scenes
for
a
long
time
and
i
could
not
could
let
the
thing
go
on
without
a
word
he
stopped
in
the
road
and
looked
at
me
yes
yes
he
said
i
daresay
but
what
does
it
lead
to
even
if
i
could
listen
to
you
ca
go
behind
the
scenes
gurnard
may
differ
from
me
in
points
but
do
you
see
he
had
walked
on
slowly
but
he
came
to
a
halt
again
we
had
better
put
these
matters
out
of
our
minds
of
course
you
are
not
drunk
but
one
is
tied
down
in
these
matters
he
spoke
very
gently
as
if
he
did
not
wish
to
offend
me
by
this
closing
of
the
door
he
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
very
old
and
very
gray
there
was
a
stile
in
the
dusty
and
he
walked
toward
it
meditating
in
a
moment
he
looked
back
at
me
i
had
forgotten
he
said
i
meant
to
suggest
that
we
should
wait
here
i
am
a
little
tired
he
perched
himself
on
the
top
bar
and
became
lost
in
the
inspection
of
the
cord
of
his
glasses
i
went
toward
him
i
knew
i
said
that
you
could
not
listen
to
to
the
sort
of
thing
but
there
were
reasons
i
felt
forced
you
will
forgive
me
he
looked
up
at
me
starting
as
if
he
had
forgotten
my
presence
yes
yes
he
said
i
have
a
certain
i
ca
think
of
the
right
word
say
respect
for
your
judgment
and
and
motives
but
you
see
there
are
for
instance
my
colleagues
i
could
go
to
them
he
lost
the
thread
of
his
idea
to
tell
the
truth
i
said
with
a
sudden
impulse
for
candour
it
is
the
political
aspect
of
the
matter
but
the
personal
i
spoke
because
it
was
just
possible
that
i
might
be
of
service
to
you
personally
and
because
i
would
like
you
to
make
a
good
fight
for
it
i
had
borrowed
her
own
words
he
looked
up
at
me
and
smiled
thank
you
he
said
i
believe
you
think
it
a
losing
game
he
added
with
a
touch
of
gray
humour
that
was
like
a
genial
hour
of
sunlight
on
a
wintry
day
i
did
not
answer
a
little
way
down
the
road
miss
churchill
carriage
whirled
into
sight
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
and
sending
up
an
attendant
cloud
of
dust
that
melted
like
smoke
through
the
of
the
leeward
hedge
so
you
do
think
much
of
me
as
a
politician
churchill
suddenly
deduced
smilingly
you
had
better
not
tell
that
to
my
aunt
i
went
up
to
town
with
churchill
that
evening
there
was
nothing
waiting
for
me
there
but
i
did
not
want
to
think
i
wanted
to
be
among
men
among
crowds
of
men
to
be
dazed
to
be
stupefied
to
hear
nothing
for
the
din
of
life
to
be
blinded
by
the
blaze
of
lights
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
churchill
carriage
a
military
member
and
a
local
member
happened
to
be
in
my
immediate
neighbourhood
their
minds
were
full
of
the
financial
scandals
and
they
dinned
their
alternating
opinions
into
me
i
assured
them
that
i
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
and
they
grew
more
solicitous
for
my
enlightenment
it
all
comes
from
having
too
many
eggs
in
one
basket
the
local
member
summed
up
the
small
enterprises
had
their
disadvantages
but
mind
you
these
gigantic
trusts
is
that
so
general
oh
i
quite
agree
with
you
the
general
barked
at
the
same
time
their
voices
sounded
on
intermingling
indistinguishable
soothing
even
i
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
hum
of
a
a
passage
of
sound
booming
on
one
note
a
passage
a
higher
and
so
on
and
so
on
visible
things
grew
hazy
fused
into
one
another
chapter
sixteen
we
reached
london
somewhat
late
in
the
evening
in
the
twilight
of
a
summer
day
there
was
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
arrival
a
hurry
and
bustle
that
changed
the
tenor
of
my
thoughts
and
broke
their
train
as
i
stood
reflecting
before
the
door
of
the
carriage
i
felt
a
friendly
pressure
of
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
you
see
to
that
churchill
voice
said
in
my
ear
you
set
the
copyists
to
work
i
go
to
the
museum
i
said
there
were
certain
extracts
to
be
made
for
the
life
of
cromwell
extracts
from
pamphlets
that
we
had
not
conveniently
at
disposal
he
nodded
walked
swiftly
toward
his
brougham
opened
the
door
and
entered
i
remember
so
well
that
last
sight
of
him
of
his
long
slim
figure
bending
down
for
the
entrance
woefully
solitary
woefully
weighted
remember
so
well
the
gleam
of
the
carriage
panels
reflecting
the
murky
light
of
the
bare
london
terminus
the
attitude
of
the
coachman
stiffly
reining
back
the
horse
the
thin
hand
that
reached
out
a
gleam
of
white
to
turn
the
gleaming
handle
there
was
something
intimately
suggestive
of
the
man
in
the
motion
of
that
hand
in
its
tentative
outstretching
its
gentle
almost
theoretic
grasp
of
the
handle
the
pleasure
of
its
friendly
pressure
on
my
shoulder
carried
me
over
some
minutes
of
solitude
its
weight
on
my
body
removing
another
from
my
mind
i
had
feared
that
my
ineffective
disclosure
had
chilled
what
of
regard
he
had
for
me
he
had
said
nothing
his
manner
had
said
nothing
but
i
had
feared
in
the
railway
carriage
he
had
sat
remote
from
me
buried
in
papers
but
that
touch
on
my
shoulder
was
enough
to
set
me
well
with
myself
again
if
not
to
afford
scope
for
pleasant
improvisation
it
at
least
showed
me
that
he
bore
me
no
otherwise
he
would
hardly
have
touched
me
perhaps
even
he
was
grateful
to
me
not
for
service
but
for
ineffectual
whatever
i
read
into
it
that
was
the
last
time
he
spoke
to
me
and
the
last
time
he
touched
me
and
i
loved
him
very
well
things
went
so
quickly
after
that
in
a
moderately
cheerful
frame
of
mind
i
strolled
the
few
yards
that
separated
me
from
my
club
intent
on
dining
in
my
averseness
to
solitude
i
sat
down
at
a
table
where
sat
already
a
little
a
man
who
bored
me
into
fits
of
nervous
excitement
he
was
by
way
of
being
an
incredibly
distant
uncle
of
my
own
as
a
rule
i
avoided
him
i
dined
with
him
he
was
a
person
of
interminable
and
incredibly
inaccurate
reminiscences
his
long
residence
in
an
swamp
had
affected
his
memory
which
was
supported
by
only
very
occasional
visits
to
england
he
told
me
tales
of
my
poor
father
and
of
my
poor
dear
mother
and
of
bromptons
and
kenwards
who
had
figured
on
their
visiting
lists
away
back
in
the
musty
sixties
your
poor
dear
father
was
precious
badly
off
then
he
said
he
had
a
hard
struggle
for
it
i
had
a
bad
time
of
it
too
worm
had
got
at
all
my
plantations
so
i
could
help
him
poor
chap
i
think
mind
you
kenny
granger
treated
him
very
badly
he
might
have
done
something
for
him
he
had
influence
kenny
had
kenny
was
my
uncle
the
head
of
the
family
the
husband
of
my
aunt
they
were
on
terms
i
said
oh
i
know
i
know
the
old
man
mumbled
but
still
for
one
only
brother
however
you
contrive
to
do
yourselves
pretty
well
making
your
pile
are
you
someone
said
to
me
the
other
day
remember
who
it
was
that
you
were
quite
one
of
the
rising
men
quite
one
of
men
very
kind
of
someone
i
said
and
now
i
see
he
went
on
lifting
up
a
copy
of
a
morning
paper
over
which
i
had
found
him
munching
his
salmon
cutlet
now
i
see
your
sister
is
going
to
marry
a
cabinet
minister
ah
he
shook
his
poor
muddled
baked
head
i
remember
you
both
as
tiny
little
dots
why
i
said
she
can
hardly
have
been
born
then
oh
yes
he
affirmed
that
was
when
i
came
over
in
she
remembered
too
that
i
brought
her
over
an
ivory
doll
she
remembered
you
have
seen
her
i
asked
oh
i
called
two
or
three
weeks
no
months
ago
she
the
image
of
your
poor
dear
mother
he
added
at
that
age
i
remarked
upon
it
to
your
aunt
but
of
course
she
could
not
remember
they
were
not
married
until
after
the
quarrel
a
sudden
restlessness
made
me
bolt
the
rest
of
my
tepid
dinner
with
my
return
to
the
upper
world
and
the
return
to
me
of
a
will
despair
of
a
sort
had
come
back
i
had
before
me
the
problem
the
necessity
of
winning
her
once
i
was
out
of
contact
with
her
she
grew
smaller
less
of
an
idea
more
of
a
person
that
one
could
win
and
there
were
two
ways
i
must
either
woo
her
as
one
woos
a
person
barred
must
compel
her
to
take
flight
to
abandon
to
cast
away
everything
or
i
must
go
to
her
as
an
eligible
suitor
with
the
etchingham
acres
and
possibilities
of
a
future
on
that
basis
this
fantastic
old
man
with
his
mumbled
reminiscences
spoilt
me
for
the
last
one
remembers
sooner
or
later
that
a
may
not
marry
his
reputed
sister
without
scandal
and
i
craved
her
intensely
she
had
upon
me
the
effect
of
an
incredible
stimulant
away
from
her
i
was
like
a
drunkard
cut
off
from
his
liquor
an
from
his
drug
i
hardly
existed
i
hardly
thought
i
had
an
errand
at
my
aunt
house
had
a
message
to
deliver
sympathetic
enquiries
to
make
and
i
wanted
to
see
her
to
gain
some
sort
of
information
from
her
to
spy
out
the
land
to
ask
her
for
terms
there
was
a
change
in
the
appearance
of
the
house
an
adventitious
brightness
that
indicated
the
rise
in
the
fortunes
of
the
family
for
me
the
house
was
empty
and
the
great
door
closed
hollowly
behind
me
my
sister
was
not
at
home
it
seemed
abominable
to
me
that
she
should
be
out
that
she
could
be
talking
to
anyone
or
could
exist
without
me
i
went
sullenly
across
the
road
to
the
palings
of
the
square
as
i
turned
the
corner
i
found
my
head
pivoting
on
my
neck
i
was
looking
over
my
shoulder
at
the
face
of
the
house
was
wondering
which
was
her
window
like
a
boy
like
a
damn
boy
i
growled
at
myself
my
sense
of
humour
was
returning
to
me
there
began
a
pilgrimage
in
search
of
companionship
london
was
a
desert
more
solitary
than
was
believable
on
those
brilliant
summer
evenings
the
streets
were
crowded
were
alive
bustled
with
the
of
footsteps
with
the
of
voices
of
laughter
it
was
impossible
to
walk
impossible
to
do
more
than
tread
on
one
own
toes
one
was
almost
blinded
by
the
constant
passing
of
faces
it
was
like
being
in
a
with
one
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
indistinguishable
ears
one
was
alone
in
one
intense
contempt
for
all
these
faces
all
these
contented
faces
one
towered
intellectually
above
them
one
towered
into
regions
of
rarefaction
and
down
below
they
enjoyed
themselves
one
understood
life
better
they
better
how
to
live
that
struck
me
then
in
oxford
street
there
was
the
intense
the
absolute
disregard
of
the
minor
inconveniences
of
the
inconveniences
of
a
crowd
of
the
ignominy
of
being
one
of
a
crowd
there
was
the
intense
poetry
of
the
soft
light
the
poetry
of
the
coolness
and
they
understood
how
to
enjoy
it
i
turned
up
an
ancient
court
near
bedford
row
in
the
name
of
god
i
said
i
will
enjoy
and
i
did
the
poetry
of
those
old
deserted
quarters
came
suddenly
home
to
me
all
the
little
commonplace
thoughts
all
the
commonplace
associations
of
georgian
london
for
the
time
i
was
done
with
the
meanings
of
things
i
was
seeking
lea
he
was
not
at
home
the
quarter
was
honeycombed
with
the
homes
of
people
one
knows
of
people
one
used
to
know
excellent
young
men
who
wrote
for
the
papers
who
papers
who
designed
posters
who
were
always
just
the
same
one
forgot
them
for
a
year
or
two
one
came
across
them
again
and
found
them
just
the
same
still
writing
for
the
same
papers
still
the
same
papers
designing
the
same
posters
i
was
in
the
mood
to
rediscover
them
in
the
privacies
of
their
hearths
with
the
same
excellent
wives
making
fair
copies
of
the
same
manuscripts
with
the
same
gaiety
of
the
same
indifferent
whiskey
brown
or
pale
or
in
heavy
square
stoppered
decanters
and
with
the
same
indifferent
virginian
tobacco
at
the
same
level
in
the
same
jars
i
was
in
the
mood
for
this
stability
for
the
excellent
household
article
that
was
their
view
of
life
and
literature
i
wanted
to
see
it
again
to
hear
again
how
it
was
filling
the
unvarying
allotted
columns
of
the
daily
the
weekly
or
the
monthly
journals
i
wanted
to
breathe
again
this
mild
atmosphere
where
there
are
no
longer
hopes
or
fears
but
alas
i
rang
bell
after
bell
of
that
gloomy
central
london
district
you
know
what
happens
one
pulls
the
knob
under
the
name
of
the
person
one
seeks
pulls
it
three
or
it
may
be
four
times
in
vain
one
rings
the
housekeeper
bell
it
reverberates
growing
fainter
and
fainter
gradually
stifled
by
a
cavernous
subterranean
atmosphere
after
an
age
a
head
peeps
round
the
opening
door
the
head
of
a
hopeless
anachronism
the
head
of
a
widow
of
early
victorian
merit
or
of
an
orphan
of
incredible
age
one
asks
for
he
out
for
williams
expecting
an
increase
of
family
and
has
gone
into
the
country
with
madame
and
waring
oh
he
gone
no
one
knows
where
and
johnson
who
used
to
live
at
number
only
comes
up
to
town
on
tuesdays
now
i
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
that
part
of
bloomsbury
the
possibilities
of
variety
in
the
types
of
housekeepers
the
rest
of
london
divided
itself
into
bands
into
zones
between
here
and
kensington
the
people
that
i
knew
could
not
be
called
on
after
dinner
those
who
lived
at
chiswick
and
beyond
were
hyperborean
one
was
bound
by
the
exigencies
of
time
it
was
ten
as
i
stood
reflecting
on
a
doorstep
on
johnson
doorstep
i
must
see
somebody
must
talk
to
somebody
before
i
went
to
bed
in
the
cheerless
room
at
the
club
it
was
true
i
might
find
a
political
stalwart
in
the
but
that
was
a
last
resort
a
desperate
and
ignominious
there
was
fox
i
should
find
him
at
the
office
but
it
needed
a
change
of
tone
before
i
could
contemplate
with
equanimity
the
meeting
of
that
individual
i
had
been
preparing
myself
to
confront
all
the
ethically
excellent
young
men
and
fox
was
ethically
speaking
far
from
excellent
rubicund
leery
a
free
lance
of
genius
i
made
the
necessary
change
in
my
tone
of
mind
and
ran
him
to
earth
the
watteau
room
was
further
enlivened
by
the
introduction
of
a
scarlet
plush
couch
of
sumptuous
design
by
its
side
stood
a
couple
of
electric
lights
the
virulent
green
of
their
shades
made
the
colours
of
the
appear
almost
unearthly
and
threw
impossible
shadows
on
the
deal
partition
round
the
couch
stood
chairs
with
piles
of
papers
neatly
arranged
on
them
round
it
on
the
floor
were
more
papers
lying
like
the
leaves
of
autumn
that
one
sings
of
on
it
lay
fox
enveloped
in
a
shetland
shawl
a
good
shawl
that
was
the
only
honest
piece
of
workmanship
in
the
place
fox
was
as
rubicund
as
ever
but
his
features
were
noticeably
peaked
and
there
were
heavy
lines
under
his
eyes
lines
cast
into
deep
shadow
by
the
light
by
which
he
was
reading
i
entered
unannounced
and
was
greeted
by
an
indifferent
upward
glance
that
changed
into
one
of
something
like
pleasure
as
he
made
out
my
features
in
the
dim
light
hullo
you
old
country
hawbuck
he
said
with
spasmodic
jocularity
i
uncommon
glad
to
see
you
he
came
to
a
jerky
close
with
an
indrawing
of
his
breath
i
about
done
he
went
on
same
old
thing
sciatica
took
me
just
after
i
got
here
this
afternoon
sent
out
one
of
the
messengers
to
buy
me
a
sofa
and
here
i
been
ever
since
well
and
what
brought
you
up
do
answer
i
know
all
about
it
got
to
keep
on
talking
until
this
particular
spasm
over
or
else
i
shall
scream
and
disturb
the
flow
of
soane
leader
well
and
now
you
come
you
stop
and
help
me
to
put
the
to
bed
you
and
then
you
can
come
and
put
me
to
bed
he
went
on
talking
at
high
pressure
exaggerating
his
expressions
heightening
his
humorous
touches
with
punctuations
of
rather
wild
laughter
at
last
he
came
to
a
stop
with
a
half
suppressed
ah
and
a
long
indrawing
of
the
breath
that
over
he
said
give
me
a
drop
of
brandy
there
a
good
fellow
i
gave
him
his
nip
then
i
explained
to
him
that
i
work
for
the
that
i
was
on
terms
with
de
mersch
been
dropping
money
over
him
he
asked
cheerfully
i
explained
a
little
more
that
there
was
a
lady
oh
it
fox
said
the
man
a
fool
but
anyhow
mersch
do
count
for
much
in
this
particular
show
he
no
money
in
it
even
so
you
may
put
your
pride
in
your
pocket
or
wherever
you
keep
it
all
right
straight
he
only
the
small
change
but
i
said
everyone
says
you
said
yourself
to
be
sure
he
answered
but
you
do
think
that
play
second
fiddle
to
a
bounder
of
that
calibre
not
really
he
looked
at
me
with
a
certain
seriousness
i
remembered
as
i
had
remembered
once
before
that
fox
was
a
personality
a
power
i
had
never
realised
till
then
how
entirely
fundamentally
different
he
was
from
any
other
man
that
i
knew
he
was
surprising
enough
to
have
belonged
to
another
race
he
looked
at
me
not
as
if
he
cared
whether
i
gave
him
his
due
or
no
but
as
if
he
were
astonished
at
my
want
of
perception
of
the
fact
he
let
his
towzled
head
fall
back
upon
the
plush
cushions
you
might
kick
him
from
here
to
greenland
for
me
he
said
i
weep
it
suits
me
to
hold
him
up
and
a
kicking
might
restore
his
equilibrium
i
sick
of
him
i
told
him
so
i
knew
there
a
woman
but
do
you
worry
the
man
here
if
that
the
case
i
said
oh
that
it
he
answered
i
helped
him
to
put
the
paper
to
bed
took
some
of
the
work
off
his
hands
it
was
all
part
of
the
getting
back
to
life
of
the
resuming
of
rusty
armour
and
i
wanted
to
pass
the
night
i
was
not
unused
to
it
as
it
happened
fox
had
had
several
of
these
fits
during
my
year
and
during
most
of
them
i
had
helped
him
through
the
night
once
or
twice
for
three
on
end
once
i
had
had
entire
control
for
a
matter
of
five
nights
but
they
gave
me
a
new
idea
of
fox
those
two
or
three
weird
hours
that
night
it
was
as
if
i
had
never
seen
him
before
the
attacks
grew
more
virulent
as
the
night
advanced
he
groaned
and
raved
and
said
things
oh
the
most
astounding
things
in
gibberish
that
upset
nerves
and
everything
else
at
the
height
he
sang
hymns
and
then
as
the
fits
passed
relapsed
into
incredible
it
gave
me
i
say
a
new
idea
of
fox
it
was
as
if
for
all
the
time
i
had
known
him
he
had
been
playing
a
part
and
that
only
now
in
the
delirium
of
his
pain
in
the
madness
into
which
he
drank
himself
were
fragments
of
the
real
man
thrown
to
the
surface
i
grew
at
last
almost
afraid
to
be
alone
with
him
in
the
dead
small
hours
of
the
morning
and
longed
for
the
time
when
i
could
go
to
bed
among
the
uninspiring
furniture
of
my
club
chapter
seventeen
at
noon
of
the
next
day
i
gave
fox
his
look
in
at
his
own
flat
he
was
stretched
upon
a
sofa
it
was
evident
that
i
was
to
take
such
of
his
duties
as
were
takeable
he
greeted
me
with
words
to
that
effect
do
go
filling
the
paper
with
your
unbreeched
geniuses
he
said
genially
and
do
overwork
yourself
there
really
nothing
to
do
but
you
being
there
will
keep
that
little
beast
evans
from
getting
too
he
like
to
jerk
me
out
altogether
thinks
they
get
on
just
as
well
without
me
i
expressed
in
my
manner
general
contempt
for
evans
and
was
taking
my
leave
oh
and
fox
called
after
me
i
turned
back
the
greenland
mail
ought
to
be
in
if
callan
contrived
to
get
his
open
run
his
stuff
in
there
a
good
chap
it
a
feature
and
all
that
you
know
i
suppose
soane
to
have
a
look
at
it
i
asked
oh
yes
he
answered
but
tell
him
to
keep
strictly
to
old
lines
rub
that
into
him
if
he
were
to
get
drunk
and
run
in
some
of
his
own
tips
it
be
awkward
people
are
expecting
cal
stuff
tell
you
what
you
take
him
out
to
lunch
eh
keep
an
eye
on
the
supplies
and
ram
it
into
him
that
he
got
to
stick
to
cal
line
of
argument
soane
as
bad
as
ever
then
i
asked
oh
fox
answered
he
be
all
right
for
the
stuff
if
you
get
that
one
idea
into
him
a
prolonged
and
acute
fit
of
pain
seized
him
i
fetched
his
man
and
left
him
to
his
rest
at
the
office
of
the
i
was
greeted
by
the
handing
to
me
of
a
proof
of
callan
manuscript
evans
the
man
across
the
screen
was
the
immediate
agent
i
suppose
it
got
to
go
in
so
i
had
it
set
up
he
said
oh
of
course
it
got
to
go
in
i
answered
it
to
go
to
soane
first
though
soane
not
here
yet
he
answered
i
noted
the
tone
of
pleasure
in
his
voice
evans
would
have
enjoyed
a
fiasco
oh
well
i
answered
nonchalantly
there
plenty
of
time
you
allow
space
on
those
lines
i
send
round
to
hunt
soane
up
i
felt
called
to
be
upon
my
mettle
i
did
much
care
about
the
paper
but
i
had
a
definite
antipathy
to
being
done
by
evans
by
a
mad
welshman
in
a
stubborn
fit
i
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
knew
that
evans
would
feign
inconceivable
stupidity
the
sort
of
black
stupidity
that
is
at
command
of
individuals
of
his
primitive
race
i
was
in
for
a
day
of
petty
worries
in
the
circumstances
it
was
a
thing
to
be
thankful
for
it
dragged
my
mind
away
from
larger
issues
one
has
no
time
for
brooding
when
one
is
driving
a
horse
in
a
jibbing
fit
evans
was
grimly
conscious
that
i
was
moderately
ignorant
of
technical
details
he
kept
them
well
before
my
eyes
all
day
long
at
odd
moments
i
tried
to
read
callan
article
it
was
impossible
it
opened
with
a
description
of
the
squalor
of
the
greenlander
life
and
contained
tawdry
passages
of
local
colour
i
knew
what
was
coming
this
was
the
view
of
the
greenlanders
of
greenland
elaborated
after
the
manner
of
callan
the
special
commissioner
so
as
to
bring
out
the
glory
and
virtue
of
the
work
of
regeneration
then
in
a
gush
of
superlatives
the
work
itself
would
be
described
i
knew
quite
well
what
was
coming
and
was
temperamentally
unable
to
read
more
than
the
first
ten
lines
everything
was
going
wrong
the
printers
developed
one
of
their
sudden
crazes
for
asking
idiotic
questions
their
messengers
came
to
evans
evans
sent
them
round
the
screen
to
me
jackson
wants
to
know
the
fourth
of
the
messengers
that
i
had
despatched
to
soane
returned
with
the
news
that
soane
would
arrive
at
nine
i
sent
out
in
search
of
the
strongest
coffee
that
the
city
afforded
soane
arrived
he
had
been
ill
he
said
very
ill
he
desired
to
be
fortified
with
champagne
i
produced
the
coffee
soane
was
the
son
of
an
irish
peer
he
had
magnificent
features
a
little
blurred
nowadays
and
a
remainder
of
the
grand
manner
his
nose
was
a
marvel
of
classic
workmanship
but
the
floods
of
time
had
reddened
and
speckled
it
not
offensively
but
ironically
his
hair
was
turning
grey
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
heavy
moustache
rather
ragged
he
inspired
one
with
the
respect
that
one
feels
for
a
man
who
has
lived
and
does
not
care
a
curse
he
had
a
weird
intermittent
genius
that
made
it
worth
fox
while
to
put
up
with
his
lapses
and
his
brutal
snubs
i
produced
the
coffee
and
pointed
to
the
sofa
of
the
night
before
damn
it
he
said
i
ill
i
tell
you
i
want
exactly
i
cut
in
you
want
a
rest
old
fellow
here
cal
article
we
want
something
special
about
it
if
you
do
feel
up
to
it
i
send
round
to
jenkins
damn
jenkins
he
said
i
up
to
it
you
understand
i
said
you
to
write
strictly
on
callan
lines
do
insert
any
information
from
extraneous
sources
and
make
it
as
slashing
as
you
like
on
those
lines
he
grunted
in
acquiescence
i
left
him
lying
on
the
sofa
drinking
the
coffee
i
had
tenderly
arranged
the
lights
for
him
as
fox
had
arranged
them
the
night
before
as
i
went
out
to
get
my
dinner
i
was
comfortably
aware
of
him
holding
the
slips
close
to
his
muddled
eyes
and
philosophically
damning
the
nature
of
things
when
i
returned
soane
from
his
sofa
said
something
that
i
did
not
catch
something
about
callan
and
his
article
oh
for
god
sake
i
answered
do
worry
me
have
some
more
coffee
and
stick
to
cal
line
of
argument
that
what
fox
said
i
not
responsible
deuced
queer
soane
muttered
he
began
to
scribble
with
a
pencil
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
knew
that
he
had
reached
the
precise
stage
at
which
something
brilliant
the
real
thing
of
its
kind
might
be
expected
very
late
soane
finished
his
leader
he
looked
up
as
he
wrote
the
last
word
i
got
it
written
he
said
but
i
say
what
the
deuce
is
up
it
like
being
a
tall
clock
with
the
mainspring
breaking
this
i
rang
the
bell
for
someone
to
take
the
copy
down
your
metaphor
too
much
for
me
soane
i
said
it
appropriate
all
the
way
along
he
maintained
if
you
call
me
a
mainspring
i
been
wound
up
and
wound
up
to
write
old
de
mersch
and
his
greenland
up
and
it
been
a
tight
wind
these
days
i
tell
you
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
boy
appeared
and
carried
off
the
copy
all
of
a
sudden
soane
resumed
something
gives
i
suppose
something
given
and
there
a
and
the
hands
fly
backwards
and
old
de
mersch
and
greenland
bump
to
the
bottom
like
the
weights
the
boom
of
the
great
presses
was
rattling
the
window
frames
soane
got
up
and
walked
toward
one
of
the
cupboards
dry
work
he
said
but
the
simile
just
is
it
i
gave
one
swift
step
toward
the
beside
the
desk
the
proof
of
callan
article
from
which
soane
had
been
writing
lay
a
crumpled
white
streamer
on
the
brown
wood
of
fox
desk
i
made
toward
it
as
i
stretched
out
my
hand
the
solution
slipped
into
my
mind
coming
with
no
more
noise
than
that
of
a
bullet
impinging
with
all
the
shock
and
remaining
with
all
the
pain
i
had
remembered
the
morning
over
there
in
paris
when
she
had
told
me
that
she
had
invited
one
of
de
lieutenants
to
betray
him
by
not
concealing
from
callan
the
real
horrors
of
the
systeme
groënlandais
flogged
butchered
miserable
natives
the
famines
the
vices
diseases
and
the
crimes
there
came
suddenly
before
my
eyes
the
tall
narrow
room
in
my
aunt
house
the
opening
of
the
door
and
her
entry
followed
by
that
of
the
woebegone
governor
of
a
province
the
man
who
was
to
show
callan
things
with
his
grating
entendu
i
remembered
the
scene
distinctly
her
words
her
looks
my
utter
unbelief
i
remembered
too
that
it
had
not
saved
me
from
a
momentary
sense
of
revolt
against
that
inflexible
intention
of
a
treachery
which
was
to
be
another
step
toward
the
inheritance
of
the
earth
i
had
rejected
the
very
idea
and
here
it
had
come
it
was
confronting
me
with
all
its
meaning
and
consequences
callan
been
shown
things
he
had
not
been
meant
to
see
and
had
written
the
truth
as
he
had
seen
it
his
article
was
a
small
thing
in
itself
but
he
had
been
sent
out
there
with
tremendous
flourishes
of
de
mersch
trumpets
he
was
man
who
could
be
believed
de
mersch
supporters
had
practically
said
if
he
condemns
us
we
are
indeed
damned
and
now
that
the
condemnation
had
come
it
meant
ruin
as
it
seemed
to
me
for
everybody
i
had
known
worked
for
seen
or
heard
of
during
the
last
year
of
my
life
it
was
ruin
for
fox
for
churchill
for
the
ministers
and
for
the
men
who
talk
in
railway
carriages
for
shopkeepers
and
for
the
government
it
was
a
menace
to
the
institutions
which
hold
us
to
the
past
that
are
our
guarantees
for
the
future
the
safety
of
everything
one
respected
and
believed
in
was
involved
in
the
disclosure
of
an
atrocious
fraud
and
the
disclosure
was
in
my
hands
for
that
night
i
had
the
power
of
the
press
in
my
keeping
people
were
waiting
for
this
pronouncement
de
mersch
last
card
was
his
philanthropy
his
model
state
and
his
happy
natives
the
drone
of
the
presses
made
the
floor
under
my
feet
quiver
and
the
whole
building
vibrated
as
if
the
earth
itself
had
trembled
i
was
alone
with
my
knowledge
did
she
know
had
she
put
the
power
in
my
hand
but
i
was
alone
and
i
was
free
i
took
up
the
proof
and
began
to
read
slanting
the
page
to
the
fall
of
the
light
it
was
a
phrenetic
indictment
but
under
the
paltry
rhetoric
of
the
man
there
was
genuine
indignation
and
pain
there
were
revolting
details
of
cruelty
to
the
miserable
helpless
and
defenceless
there
were
greed
and
stripped
naked
but
more
revolting
to
see
without
a
mask
was
that
falsehood
which
had
been
hiding
under
the
words
that
for
ages
had
spurred
men
to
noble
deeds
to
to
heroism
what
was
appalling
was
the
sudden
perception
that
all
the
traditional
ideals
of
honour
glory
conscience
had
been
committed
to
the
upholding
of
a
gigantic
and
atrocious
fraud
the
falsehood
had
spread
stealthily
had
eaten
into
the
very
heart
of
creeds
and
convictions
that
we
lean
upon
on
our
passage
between
the
past
and
the
future
the
old
order
of
things
had
to
live
or
perish
with
a
lie
i
saw
all
this
with
the
intensity
and
clearness
of
a
revelation
i
saw
it
as
though
i
had
been
asleep
through
a
year
of
work
and
dreams
and
had
awakened
to
the
truth
i
saw
it
all
i
saw
her
intention
what
was
i
to
do
without
my
marking
its
approach
emotion
was
upon
me
the
fingers
that
held
up
the
extended
slips
tattooed
one
on
another
through
its
negligible
thickness
pretty
thick
that
soane
said
he
was
looking
back
at
me
from
the
cupboard
he
had
opened
i
rubbed
it
in
too
there
be
hats
on
the
green
he
had
his
head
inside
the
cupboard
and
his
voice
came
to
me
hollowly
he
extracted
a
large
bottle
with
a
neck
wo
it
upset
the
apple
cart
he
said
very
loudly
it
his
voice
acted
on
me
as
the
slight
shake
upon
a
phial
full
of
waiting
chemicals
crystallised
them
suddenly
with
a
little
click
everything
suddenly
grew
very
clear
to
me
i
suddenly
understood
that
all
the
tortuous
intrigue
hinged
upon
what
i
did
in
the
next
few
minutes
it
rested
with
me
now
to
stretch
out
my
hand
to
that
button
in
the
wall
or
to
let
the
whole
world
the
the
probity
that
sort
of
thing
she
had
said
fall
to
pieces
the
drone
of
the
presses
continued
to
make
itself
felt
like
the
quiver
of
a
suppressed
emotion
i
might
stop
them
or
i
might
not
it
rested
with
me
everybody
was
in
my
hands
they
were
quite
small
if
i
let
the
thing
go
on
they
would
be
done
for
utterly
and
the
new
era
would
begin
soane
had
got
hold
of
a
couple
of
glasses
they
clinked
together
whilst
he
searched
the
cupboard
for
something
eh
what
he
said
it
pretty
is
it
ought
to
shake
out
some
of
the
supporters
eh
bill
comes
on
do
for
that
i
should
think
he
wanted
a
corkscrew
very
badly
but
that
was
precisely
it
it
would
shake
out
some
of
the
supporters
and
give
gurnard
his
patent
excuse
churchill
i
knew
would
stick
to
his
line
the
saner
policy
but
so
many
of
the
men
who
had
stuck
to
churchill
would
fall
away
now
and
gurnard
of
course
would
lead
them
to
his
own
triumph
it
was
a
criminal
verdict
callan
had
gone
out
as
a
commissioner
with
a
good
deal
of
and
this
was
his
report
this
shriek
if
it
sounded
across
the
if
i
let
it
to
the
saner
policy
and
to
churchill
it
did
not
make
any
difference
that
churchill
the
saner
policy
because
there
was
no
one
in
the
nation
sane
enough
to
see
it
they
wanted
purity
in
high
places
and
here
was
a
definite
criminal
indictment
against
de
mersch
and
de
mersch
would
in
a
manner
of
speaking
have
to
be
lynched
policy
or
no
policy
she
wanted
this
and
in
all
the
earth
she
was
the
only
desirable
thing
if
i
thwarted
her
she
would
what
would
she
do
now
i
looked
at
soane
what
would
happen
if
i
stopped
the
presses
i
asked
soane
was
twisting
his
corkscrew
in
the
wire
of
the
champagne
bottle
it
was
fatal
i
could
see
nothing
on
earth
but
her
what
else
was
there
in
the
world
wine
the
light
of
the
sun
the
wind
on
the
heath
honour
my
god
what
was
honour
to
me
if
i
could
see
nothing
but
her
on
earth
would
honour
or
wine
or
sun
or
wind
ever
give
me
what
she
could
give
let
them
go
what
would
happen
if
what
soane
grumbled
this
wire
oh
i
was
thinking
about
something
i
answered
the
wire
gave
with
a
little
snap
and
he
began
to
ease
the
cork
was
i
to
let
the
light
pass
me
by
for
the
sake
of
of
fox
for
instance
who
trusted
me
well
let
fox
go
and
churchill
and
what
churchill
stood
for
the
probity
the
greatness
and
the
spirit
of
the
past
from
which
had
sprung
my
conscience
and
the
consciences
of
the
sleeping
millions
around
me
the
woman
at
the
poultry
show
with
her
farmers
and
shopkeepers
let
them
go
too
soane
put
into
my
hand
one
of
his
charged
glasses
he
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
infinite
a
forgotten
shape
i
sat
down
at
the
desk
opposite
him
deuced
good
idea
he
said
suddenly
to
stop
the
confounded
presses
and
spoof
old
fox
he
up
to
some
devilry
and
by
jove
i
like
to
get
my
knife
in
him
jove
i
would
and
then
chuck
up
everything
and
leave
for
the
sandwich
islands
i
sick
of
this
life
this
life
one
might
have
made
a
pile
though
if
one
known
this
smash
was
coming
but
one
ca
get
at
the
innards
of
no
such
luck
no
such
luck
eh
i
looked
at
him
stupidly
took
in
his
eyes
and
his
ruffled
grizzling
hair
i
wondered
who
he
was
il
i
seemed
to
be
back
in
paris
i
could
think
of
what
i
had
been
thinking
of
i
drank
his
glass
of
wine
and
he
filled
me
another
i
drank
that
too
ah
yes
even
then
the
thing
was
settled
even
now
that
i
had
recognized
that
fox
and
the
others
were
of
no
account
what
remained
was
to
prove
to
her
that
i
was
a
mere
chattel
a
piece
in
the
game
i
was
at
the
very
heart
of
the
thing
after
all
it
was
chance
that
had
put
me
there
the
blind
chance
of
all
the
little
things
that
lead
in
the
inevitable
the
future
if
now
i
thwarted
her
she
would
what
would
she
do
she
would
have
to
begin
all
over
again
she
would
want
to
be
revenged
she
was
revengeful
but
how
if
she
would
never
look
upon
me
again
the
thing
had
reduced
itself
to
a
mere
matter
of
policy
or
was
it
passion
a
clatter
of
the
wheels
of
heavy
carts
and
of
the
hoofs
of
heavy
horses
on
granite
struck
like
hammer
blows
on
my
ears
coming
from
the
well
of
the
below
soane
had
finished
his
bottle
and
was
walking
to
the
cupboard
he
paused
at
the
window
and
stood
looking
down
strong
beggars
those
porters
he
said
i
could
carry
that
weight
of
paper
not
with
my
rot
on
it
let
alone
callan
you
think
it
would
break
down
the
carts
i
understood
that
they
were
loading
the
carts
for
the
newspaper
mails
there
was
still
time
to
stop
them
i
got
up
and
went
toward
the
window
very
swiftly
i
was
going
to
call
to
them
to
stop
loading
i
threw
the
casement
open
of
course
i
did
not
stop
them
the
solution
flashed
on
me
with
the
breath
of
the
raw
air
it
was
ridiculously
simple
if
i
thwarted
her
well
she
would
respect
me
but
her
business
in
life
was
the
inheritance
of
the
earth
and
however
much
she
might
respect
me
or
by
so
much
the
more
she
would
recognise
that
i
was
a
force
to
deflect
her
from
the
right
line
a
disease
for
me
she
had
said
what
i
have
to
do
i
said
is
to
show
her
that
that
i
had
her
in
my
hands
and
that
i
loyally
the
thing
was
so
simple
that
i
triumphed
triumphed
with
the
full
glow
of
wine
triumphed
looking
down
into
that
murky
where
the
lanthorns
danced
about
in
the
rays
of
a
great
arc
lamp
the
gilt
letters
scattered
all
over
the
windows
blazed
forth
the
names
of
innumerable
ventures
well
he
he
had
been
a
power
but
i
triumphed
i
had
loyally
with
the
powers
of
the
future
though
i
wanted
no
share
in
the
inheritance
of
the
earth
only
i
was
going
to
push
into
the
future
one
of
the
great
carts
got
into
motion
amidst
a
shower
of
sounds
that
whirled
upward
round
and
round
the
well
the
black
hood
swayed
like
the
shoulders
of
an
elephant
as
it
passed
beneath
my
feet
under
the
arch
it
disappeared
it
was
too
in
a
few
hours
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
country
of
the
world
would
be
raising
their
hands
oh
yes
it
was
loyally
i
closed
the
window
soane
was
holding
a
champagne
bottle
in
one
hand
in
the
other
he
had
a
paper
knife
of
fox
a
metal
thing
a
japanese
dagger
or
a
deccan
knife
he
sliced
the
neck
off
the
bottle
thought
you
were
going
to
throw
yourself
out
he
said
i
stop
you
sick
of
it
sick
look
at
this
this
infernal
trick
of
fox
and
i
helped
too
why
i
must
eat
he
paused
and
drink
he
added
but
there
is
starvation
for
no
end
of
fools
in
this
little
move
a
few
will
be
losing
their
good
names
too
i
do
care
off
what
is
he
doing
it
for
money
funk
you
ought
to
know
you
must
be
in
it
too
it
not
hunger
with
you
wonderful
what
people
will
do
to
keep
their
pet
vice
going
eh
he
swayed
a
little
you
do
drink
what
your
pet
vice
he
looked
at
me
very
defiantly
clutching
the
neck
of
the
empty
bottle
his
drunken
and
overbearing
glare
seemed
to
force
upon
me
a
complicity
in
his
squalid
bargain
with
life
rewarded
by
a
squalid
freedom
he
was
pitiful
and
odious
to
my
eyes
and
somehow
in
a
moment
he
appeared
menacing
you
ca
frighten
me
i
said
in
response
to
the
strange
fear
he
had
inspired
no
one
can
frighten
me
now
a
sense
of
my
inaccessibility
was
the
first
taste
of
an
achieved
triumph
i
had
done
with
fear
the
poor
devil
before
me
appeared
infinitely
remote
he
was
lost
but
he
was
only
one
of
the
lost
one
of
those
that
i
could
see
already
overwhelmed
by
the
rush
from
the
opened
at
my
touch
he
would
be
destroyed
in
good
company
swept
out
of
my
sight
together
with
the
past
they
had
known
and
with
the
future
they
had
waited
for
but
he
was
odious
i
am
done
with
you
i
said
eh
what
who
wants
to
frighten
i
wanted
to
know
what
your
pet
vice
wo
tell
you
might
safely
i
off

to
tell
me

going
to
be

angel

of
all
this
warm
sand
warm
mind

an
injured
expression
well
i
off
see
me
into
the
cab
old
chap
you
a
decent
fellow
after
all
not
one
of
these
beggars
who
would
sell
their
best
friend
for
a
little
money
or
some
woman
will
see
the
last
of
me
i
did
believe
he
would
reach
the
south
seas
but
i
went
downstairs
and
watched
him
march
up
the
street
with
a
slight
stagger
under
the
pallid
dawn
i
suppose
it
was
the
lingering
chill
of
the
night
that
made
me
shiver
i
felt
unbounded
confidence
in
the
future
there
was
nothing
now
between
her
and
me
the
echo
of
my
footsteps
on
the
flagstones
accompanied
me
filling
the
empty
earth
with
the
sound
of
my
progress
chapter
eighteen
i
walked
along
got
to
my
club
and
upstairs
into
my
room
peaceably
a
feeling
of
entire
tranquillity
had
come
over
me
i
rested
after
a
strife
which
had
issued
in
a
victory
whose
meaning
was
too
great
to
comprehend
and
enjoy
at
once
i
only
knew
that
it
was
great
because
there
seemed
nothing
more
left
to
do
everything
reposed
within
me
even
conscience
even
memory
reposed
as
in
death
i
had
risen
above
them
and
my
thoughts
moved
serenely
as
in
a
new
light
as
men
move
in
sunshine
above
the
graves
of
the
forgotten
dead
i
felt
like
a
man
at
the
beginning
of
a
long
holiday
an
indefinite
space
of
idleness
with
some
great
felicity
a
felicity
too
great
for
words
too
great
for
joy
at
the
end
everything
was
delicious
and
vague
there
were
no
shapes
no
persons
names
flitted
through
my
mind
fox
churchill
my
aunt
but
they
were
living
people
seen
from
above
flitting
in
the
dusk
without
individuality
things
that
moved
below
me
in
a
valley
from
which
i
had
emerged
i
must
have
been
dreaming
of
them
i
know
i
dreamed
of
her
she
alone
was
distinct
among
these
shapes
she
appeared
dazzling
resplendent
with
a
splendid
calmness
and
i
braced
myself
to
the
shock
of
love
the
love
i
had
known
that
all
men
had
known
but
greater
transcendental
almost
terrible
a
fit
reward
for
the
sacrifice
of
a
whole
past
suddenly
she
spoke
i
heard
a
sound
like
the
rustling
of
a
wind
through
trees
and
i
felt
the
shock
of
an
unknown
emotion
made
up
of
fear
and
of
enthusiasm
as
though
she
had
been
not
a
woman
but
only
a
voice
crying
strange
unknown
words
in
inspiring
tones
promising
and
cruel
without
any
passion
of
love
or
hate
i
listened
it
was
like
the
wind
in
the
trees
of
a
little
wood
no
hate
no
love
no
love
there
was
a
crash
as
of
a
falling
temple
i
was
borne
to
the
earth
overwhelmed
crushed
by
an
immensity
of
ruin
and
of
sorrow
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
the
sun
shining
through
the
i
seem
to
remember
i
was
surprised
at
it
i
do
know
why
perhaps
the
lingering
effect
of
the
ruin
in
the
dream
which
had
involved
sunshine
itself
i
liked
it
though
and
lay
for
a
time
enjoying
the
what
shall
i
say
usualness
of
it
the
sunshine
of
yesterday
of
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
morning
must
be
far
advanced
and
i
got
up
briskly
as
a
man
rises
to
his
work
but
as
soon
as
i
got
on
my
legs
i
felt
as
if
i
had
already
myself
in
reality
there
was
nothing
to
do
all
my
muscles
twitched
with
fatigue
i
had
experienced
the
same
sensations
once
after
an
hour
desperate
swimming
to
save
myself
from
being
carried
out
to
sea
by
the
tide
no
there
was
nothing
to
do
i
descended
the
staircase
and
an
utter
sense
of
aimlessness
drove
me
out
through
the
big
doors
which
swung
behind
me
without
noise
i
turned
toward
the
river
and
on
the
broad
embankment
the
sunshine
enveloped
me
friendly
familiar
and
warm
like
the
care
of
an
old
friend
a
black
dumb
barge
drifted
clumsy
and
empty
and
the
solitary
man
in
it
wrestled
with
the
heavy
sweep
straining
his
arms
throwing
his
face
up
to
the
sky
at
every
effort
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
though
it
was
the
river
that
did
his
work
for
him
his
exertions
impressed
me
with
the
idea
that
i
too
had
something
to
do
certainly
i
had
one
always
has
somehow
i
could
not
remember
it
was
intolerable
and
even
alarming
this
blank
this
emptiness
of
the
many
hours
before
night
came
again
till
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
me
i
had
to
make
some
extracts
in
the
british
museum
for
our
our
cromwell
there
was
no
cromwell
he
had
lived
had
worked
for
the
future
and
now
he
had
ceased
to
exist
his
future
our
past
had
come
to
an
end
the
barge
with
the
man
still
straining
at
the
oar
had
gone
out
of
sight
under
the
arch
of
the
bridge
as
through
a
gate
into
another
world
a
bizarre
sense
of
solitude
stole
upon
me
and
i
turned
my
back
upon
the
river
as
empty
as
my
day
hansoms
broughams
streamed
with
a
continuous
muffled
roll
of
wheels
and
a
beat
of
hoofs
a
big
dray
put
in
a
note
of
thunder
and
a
clank
of
chains
i
found
myself
curiously
unable
to
understand
what
possible
purpose
remained
to
keep
them
in
motion
the
past
that
had
made
them
had
come
to
an
end
and
their
future
had
been
devoured
by
a
new
conception
and
what
of
churchill
he
too
had
worked
for
the
future
he
would
live
on
but
he
had
already
ceased
to
exist
i
had
evoked
him
in
this
poignant
thought
and
he
came
not
alone
he
came
with
a
train
of
all
the
vanquished
in
this
stealthy
unseen
contest
for
an
immense
stake
in
which
i
was
one
of
the
victors
they
crowded
upon
me
i
saw
fox
polehampton
de
mersch
himself
crowds
of
figures
without
a
name
women
with
whom
i
had
fancied
myself
in
love
men
i
had
shaken
by
the
hand
lea
reproachful
ironical
face
they
were
near
near
enough
to
touch
nearer
i
did
not
only
see
them
i
absolutely
felt
them
all
their
tumultuous
and
silent
stir
seemed
to
raise
a
tumult
in
my
breast
i
sprang
suddenly
to
my
feet
a
sensation
that
i
had
had
before
that
was
not
new
to
me
a
remembered
fear
had
me
fast
a
remembered
voice
seemed
to
speak
clearly
incomprehensible
words
that
had
moved
me
before
the
sheer
faces
of
the
enormous
buildings
near
at
hand
seemed
to
topple
forwards
like
cliffs
in
an
earthquake
and
for
an
instant
i
saw
beyond
them
into
unknown
depths
that
i
had
seen
into
before
it
was
as
if
the
shadow
of
annihilation
had
passed
over
them
beneath
the
sunshine
then
they
returned
to
rest
motionless
but
with
a
changed
aspect
this
is
too
absurd
i
said
to
myself
i
am
not
well
i
was
certainly
unfit
for
any
sort
of
work
but
i
must
get
through
the
day
somehow
i
had
a
pale
vision
of
her
face
as
it
had
appeared
to
me
at
sunset
on
the
first
day
i
had
met
her
i
went
back
to
my
club
to
lunch
of
course
i
had
no
appetite
but
i
was
tormented
by
the
idea
of
an
interminable
afternoon
before
me
i
sat
idly
for
a
long
time
behind
my
back
two
men
were
talking
churchill
oh
no
better
than
the
rest
he
only
wants
to
be
found
out
if
i
any
nose
for
that
sort
of
thing
there
something
in
the
air
it
absurd
to
be
told
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
seen
the
i
got
up
to
go
away
but
suddenly
found
myself
standing
by
their
table
you
are
unjust
i
said
they
looked
up
at
me
together
with
an
immense
surprise
i
did
know
them
and
i
passed
on
but
i
heard
one
of
them
ask
who
that
fellow
oh
etchingham
granger
is
he
queer
the
other
postulated
i
went
slowly
down
the
great
staircase
a
knot
of
men
was
huddled
round
the
tape
machine
others
came
half
trotting
half
walking
to
peer
over
heads
under
what
the
matter
with
that
thing
i
asked
of
one
of
them
oh
grogram
up
he
said
and
passed
me
someone
from
a
point
of
vantage
read
out
the
leader
of
the
house
sir
grogram
devonport
said
that
the
words
came
haltingly
to
my
ears
as
the
man
voice
followed
the
jerks
of
the
little
instrument
the
government
obviously
could
not
alter
its
policy
at
eleventh
hour
at
dictates
of
quite
irresponsible
person
in
one
of
the
daily
papers
i
was
wondering
whether
it
was
soane
or
callan
who
was
poor
old
grogram
quite
irresponsible
person
when
i
caught
the
sound
of
gurnard
name
i
turned
irritably
away
i
did
want
to
hear
that
fool
read
out
the
words
of
that
it
was
like
the
warning
croak
of
a
raven
in
an
old
ballad
i
began
desultorily
to
descend
to
the
in
the
cimmerian
gloom
of
the
stairway
the
voice
of
a
pursuer
hailed
me
i
say
granger
i
say
granger
i
looked
back
the
man
was
one
of
the
rats
of
the
lower
journalism
rubicund
asthmatic
a
mass
of
flesh
that
might
to
the
advantage
of
his
country
and
himself
have
served
as
a
cavalry
trooper
he
puffed
stertorously
down
towards
me
i
say
i
say
his
breath
came
rattling
and
wheezing
what
up
at
the
i
sure
i
do
know
i
answered
curtly
they
said
you
took
it
yesterday
you
been
playing
the
very
devil
have
you
but
i
suppose
it
was
not
off
your
own
bat
oh
i
never
play
off
my
own
bat
i
answered
of
course
i
do
want
to
intrude
he
said
again
in
the
gloom
i
was
beginning
to
discern
the
workings
of
the
tortured
apoplectic
face
but
i
say
what
de
mersch
little
game
you
better
ask
him
i
answered
it
was
incredibly
hateful
this
satyr
mask
in
the
dim
light
he
not
in
london
it
answered
with
a
wink
of
the
creased
eyelids
but
i
suppose
now
fox
and
de
mersch
have
had
a
row
now
have
they
i
did
not
answer
the
thing
was
wearily
hateful
and
this
was
only
the
beginning
hundreds
more
would
be
asking
the
same
question
in
a
few
minutes
the
head
wagged
on
the
mountainous
shoulders
looks
fishy
he
said
i
recognised
that
to
force
words
from
me
he
was
threatening
a
kind
of
blackmail
another
voice
began
to
call
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
say
granger
i
say
granger
i
pushed
the
apart
and
went
slowly
down
the
gloomy
room
i
heard
the
doors
swing
again
and
footsteps
patter
on
the
matting
behind
me
i
did
not
turn
the
man
came
round
me
and
looked
at
my
face
it
was
polehampton
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
i
say
he
said
i
say
what
does
it
mean
does
it
mean
it
was
very
difficult
for
me
to
look
at
him
i
tell
you
he
began
again
he
had
the
dictatorial
air
of
a
very
small
quite
hopeless
man
a
man
mystified
by
a
blow
of
unknown
provenance
i
tell
you
he
began
again
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
i
said
roughly
oh
but
you
advised
me
to
buy
he
had
become
supplicatory
did
you
now
did
you
you
said
you
remember
that
i
did
answer
the
man
what
had
i
got
to
say
he
remained
looking
intently
at
me
as
if
it
were
of
the
greatest
moment
to
him
that
i
should
make
the
acknowledgment
and
share
the
blame
as
if
it
would
take
an
immense
load
from
his
shoulders
i
could
do
it
i
hated
him
did
you
he
began
categorically
did
you
advise
me
to
buy
those
debentures
of
de
mersch
i
did
not
answer
what
does
it
all
mean
he
said
again
if
this
bill
does
get
through
i
tell
you
i
shall
be
ruined
and
they
say
that
gurnard
is
going
to
smash
it
they
are
all
saying
it
up
there
and
that
you
you
on
the
are
are
responsible
he
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
began
to
blow
his
nose
i
did
say
a
single
word
but
what
to
be
done
he
started
again
what
to
be
i
tell
you
my
daughter
you
know
she
very
brave
she
said
to
me
this
morning
she
could
work
but
she
could
you
know
she
not
been
brought
up
to
that
sort
of
thing
not
even
typewriting
and
so
we
all
ruined
everyone
of
us
and
i
more
than
fifty
hands
counting
lea
and
they
all
have
to
go
it
horrible
i
trusted
you
granger
you
know
i
trusted
you
and
they
say
up
there
that
you
i
turned
away
from
him
i
could
bear
to
see
the
bewildered
fear
in
his
eyes
so
many
of
us
he
began
again
everyone
i
know
i
told
them
to
buy
and
but
you
might
have
let
us
know
granger
you
might
have
think
of
my
poor
daughter
i
wanted
to
say
something
to
the
man
wanted
to
horribly
but
there
was
anything
to
say
not
a
word
i
was
sorry
i
took
up
a
paper
that
sprawled
on
one
of
the
purple
ottomans
i
stood
with
my
back
to
this
haggard
man
and
pretended
to
read
i
noticed
incredulously
that
i
was
swaying
on
my
legs
i
looked
round
me
two
old
men
were
asleep
in
armchairs
under
the
gloomy
windows
one
had
his
head
thrown
back
the
other
was
crumpled
forward
into
himself
his
frail
white
hand
just
touched
the
floor
a
little
further
off
two
young
men
were
talking
they
had
the
air
of
conspirators
over
their
empty
coffee
cups
i
was
conscious
that
polehampton
had
left
me
that
he
had
gone
from
behind
me
but
i
do
think
i
was
conscious
of
the
passage
of
time
god
knows
how
long
i
stood
there
now
and
then
i
saw
polehampton
face
before
my
eyes
with
the
eyes
the
ruffled
hair
the
lines
of
tears
seaming
the
cheeks
seeming
to
look
out
at
me
from
the
crumple
of
the
paper
that
i
held
i
knew
too
that
there
were
faces
like
that
everywhere
everywhere
faces
of
little
people
of
no
more
account
than
the
dead
in
graveyards
just
the
material
to
make
graveyards
nothing
more
little
people
of
absolutely
no
use
but
just
to
suffer
horribly
from
this
blow
coming
upon
them
from
nowhere
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
at
the
time
that
their
inheritance
had
passed
to
me
to
us
and
yet
i
began
to
wonder
stupidly
what
was
the
difference
between
me
and
me
yesterday
there
was
any
not
any
at
all
only
i
had
nothing
more
to
do
the
doors
at
the
end
of
the
room
flew
open
as
if
burst
by
a
great
outcry
penetrating
from
without
and
a
man
appeared
running
up
the
room
one
of
those
men
who
bear
news
eternally
who
catch
the
distant
clamour
and
carry
it
into
quiet
streets
why
did
he
disturb
me
did
i
want
to
hear
his
news
i
wanted
to
think
of
churchill
to
think
of
how
to
explain
the
man
was
running
up
the
room
i
say
i
say
you
beggars
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
i
felt
such
an
absolute
conviction
of
being
alone
and
it
was
then
i
believe
that
in
this
solitude
that
had
descended
upon
my
soul
i
seemed
to
see
the
shape
of
an
approaching
nemesis
it
is
permitted
to
no
man
to
break
with
his
past
with
the
past
of
his
kind
and
to
throw
away
the
treasure
of
his
future
i
began
to
suspect
i
had
gained
nothing
i
began
to
understand
that
even
such
a
catastrophe
was
possible
i
sat
down
in
the
nearest
chair
then
my
fear
passed
away
the
room
was
filling
it
hummed
with
excited
voices
churchill
no
better
than
the
others
i
heard
somebody
saying
two
men
had
stopped
talking
they
were
a
little
gray
and
ruddy
the
face
of
one
was
angry
and
of
the
other
sad
he
wanted
only
to
be
found
out
what
a
fall
in
the
mud
no
matter
said
the
other
one
is
made
a
little
sad
he
stood
for
everything
i
had
been
pinning
my
faith
to
they
passed
on
a
brazen
voice
bellowed
in
the
distance
the
greatest
fall
of
any
minister
that
ever
was
a
tall
heavy
journalist
in
a
white
waistcoat
was
the
centre
of
a
group
that
turned
slowly
upon
itself
gathering
bulk
done
for
stood
up
to
the
last
i
saw
him
get
into
his
brougham
the
police
had
a
job
there
quite
a
riot
down
there
pale
as
a
ghost
gurnard
gurnard
magnificent
very
cool
and
in
his
best
form
threw
them
over
without
as
much
as
a
wink
outraged
conscience
speech
magnificent
why
it
the
chance
of
his
life
and
then
for
a
time
the
voices
and
the
faces
seemed
to
pass
away
and
die
out
i
had
dropped
my
paper
and
as
i
stooped
to
pick
it
up
the
voices
returned
granger
etchingham
granger
sister
is
going
to
marry
gurnard
i
got
on
to
my
hands
and
knees
to
pick
up
the
paper
of
course
what
i
did
not
understand
was
where
the
water
came
from
otherwise
it
was
pretty
clear
somebody
seemed
to
be
in
a
fit
no
he
was
drunk
look
at
his
teeth
what
did
they
want
to
look
at
his
teeth
for
was
he
a
horse
it
must
have
been
i
that
was
in
the
fit
there
were
a
lot
of
men
round
me
the
front
row
on
their
knees
holding
me
some
of
them
a
man
in
a
red
coat
and
plush
breeches
a
waiter
was
holding
a
glass
of
water
another
had
a
small
bottle
they
were
talking
about
me
under
their
breaths
at
one
end
of
the
horseshoe
someone
said
he
the
man
who
then
he
caught
my
eye
he
lowered
his
voice
and
the
abominable
whisper
ran
round
among
the
heads
it
was
easy
to
guess
the
man
who
was
got
at
i
was
to
be
that
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
was
to
be
famous
at
last
there
came
the
desire
to
be
out
of
it
i
struggled
to
my
feet
someone
said
feel
better
now
i
answered
i
oh
i
got
to
go
and
see
it
was
rather
difficult
to
speak
distinctly
my
tongue
got
in
the
way
but
i
strove
to
impress
the
fool
with
the
idea
that
i
had
affairs
that
must
be
attended
to
that
i
had
private
affairs
you
are
fit
let
me
i
pushed
him
roughly
aside
what
business
was
it
of
his
i
slunk
hastily
out
of
the
room
the
others
remained
i
knew
what
they
were
going
to
do
to
talk
things
over
to
gabble
about
the
man
who
it
was
treacherous
walking
that
tessellated
pavement
in
the
hall
someone
said
hullo
granger
as
i
passed
i
took
no
notice
where
did
i
wish
to
go
to
there
was
no
one
who
could
minister
to
me
the
whole
world
had
resolved
itself
into
a
vast
solitary
city
of
closed
doors
i
had
no
friend
no
one
but
i
must
go
somewhere
must
hide
somewhere
must
speak
to
someone
i
mumbled
the
address
of
fox
to
a
cabman
some
idea
of
expiation
must
have
been
in
my
mind
some
idea
of
seeing
the
thing
through
mingled
with
that
necessity
for
talking
to
someone
anyone
i
was
afraid
too
not
of
fox
rage
not
even
of
anything
that
he
could
do
but
of
the
sight
of
his
despair
he
had
become
a
tragic
figure
i
reached
his
flat
and
i
had
said
it
is
i
and
again
it
is
i
and
he
had
not
stirred
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
under
a
rug
motionless
as
a
corpse
i
had
paced
up
and
down
the
room
i
remember
that
the
pile
of
the
carpet
was
so
long
that
it
was
impossible
to
walk
upon
it
easily
everything
else
in
the
room
was
conceived
in
an
exuberance
of
luxury
that
now
had
something
of
the
macabre
in
it
it
was
that
now
before
it
had
been
unclean
there
was
a
great
bed
whose
lines
suggested
sinking
softness
a
glaring
yellow
satin
coverlet
vast
like
a
sea
the
walls
were
covered
with
yellow
satin
the
windows
draped
with
lace
worth
a
king
ransom
the
light
was
softened
the
air
dead
the
sounds
hung
slumbrously
and
in
the
centre
of
it
that
motionless
body
it
stirred
pivoted
on
some
central
axis
beneath
the
rug
and
faced
me
sitting
there
was
no
look
of
inquiry
in
the
bloodshot
eyes
they
turned
dully
upon
me
in
a
setting
there
was
no
expression
in
the
suffused
face
you
want
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
august
by
dint
of
hopelessness
i
want
to
explain
i
said
i
had
no
idea
that
this
was
what
i
had
come
for
he
answered
only
you
he
had
the
air
of
one
speaking
to
something
infinitely
unimportant
it
was
as
if
i
had
no
inkling
of
the
real
issue
with
a
bravery
of
desperation
i
began
to
explain
that
i
had
stumbled
into
the
thing
that
i
had
acted
for
my
own
ends
my
own
ends
i
repeated
it
several
times
i
wanted
him
to
understand
and
i
did
explain
i
kept
nothing
from
him
neither
her
coming
nor
her
words
nor
my
feelings
i
had
gone
in
with
my
eyes
open
for
the
first
time
fox
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
sentient
being
oh
you
know
that
much
he
said
listlessly
it
no
disgrace
to
have
gone
under
to
her
i
said
we
to
his
despair
seemed
to
link
him
into
one
we
with
myself
i
wanted
to
put
heart
into
him
i
do
know
why
he
did
look
at
me
again
oh
he
said
dully
i
i
understand
who
you
mean
if
i
had
known
before
i
might
have
done
something
but
she
came
of
a
higher
plane
he
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
the
horror
grew
large
i
remembered
that
she
had
said
that
fox
like
herself
was
one
of
a
race
apart
that
was
to
supersede
us
dimensionists
and
when
i
looked
at
him
now
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
of
a
race
different
to
my
own
just
as
he
had
always
seemed
different
from
any
other
man
he
had
had
a
different
tone
in
triumph
he
was
different
now
in
his
despair
he
went
on
i
might
have
managed
gurnard
alone
but
i
never
thought
of
her
coming
you
see
one
does
one
best
but
somehow
here
one
grows
rather
blind
i
ought
to
have
stuck
to
gurnard
of
course
never
to
have
broken
with
him
we
ought
all
to
have
kept
but
i
kept
my
end
up
as
long
as
he
was
alone
he
went
on
talking
in
an
expressionless
monotone
perhaps
to
himself
perhaps
to
me
i
listened
as
one
listens
to
unmeaning
sounds
to
that
of
a
distant
train
at
night
he
was
looking
at
the
floor
his
mouth
moving
mechanically
he
sat
perfectly
square
one
hand
on
either
knee
his
back
bowed
out
his
head
drooping
forward
it
was
as
if
there
were
no
more
muscular
force
in
the
whole
man
as
if
he
were
one
of
those
ancient
things
one
sees
sunning
themselves
on
benches
by
the
walls
of
workhouses
but
i
said
angrily
it
not
all
over
you
can
make
a
fight
for
it
still
you
do
seem
to
understand
he
answered
it
all
over
the
whole
thing
i
ran
churchill
and
his
conscious
rectitude
gang
for
all
they
were
worth
well
i
liked
them
i
was
a
fool
to
give
way
to
but
i
one
grows
weak
among
people
like
you
of
course
i
knew
that
their
day
was
over
and
it
all
he
said
again
after
a
long
pause
and
what
will
you
i
asked
half
hysterically
i
do
just
know
he
answered
we
none
of
us
gone
under
before
there
have
been
enough
really
to
clash
until
she
came
the
dead
tranquillity
of
his
manner
was
overwhelming
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
was
not
as
i
was
whose
standard
of
values
absolute
to
himself
was
not
to
be
measured
by
any
of
mine
i
suppose
i
shall
cut
my
throat
he
began
again
i
noticed
with
impersonal
astonishment
that
the
length
of
my
right
side
was
covered
with
the
dust
of
a
floor
in
my
restless
motions
i
came
opposite
the
fireplace
above
it
hung
a
number
of
tiny
jewelled
frames
containing
daubs
of
an
astonishing
lewdness
the
riddle
grew
painful
what
kind
of
a
being
could
conceive
this
impossibly
barbaric
room
could
enshrine
those
impossibly
crude
designs
and
then
fold
his
hands
i
turned
fiercely
upon
him
but
you
are
rich
enough
to
enjoy
life
i
said
what
that
he
asked
wearily
in
the
name
of
god
i
shouted
what
do
you
work
for
what
have
you
been
plotting
and
plotting
for
if
not
to
enjoy
your
life
at
the
last
he
made
a
small
indefinite
motion
of
ignorance
as
if
i
had
propounded
to
him
a
problem
that
he
could
not
solve
that
he
did
not
think
worth
the
solving
it
came
to
me
as
the
confirmation
of
a
suspicion
that
motion
they
had
no
joy
these
people
who
were
to
supersede
us
their
did
nothing
more
for
them
than
just
that
enabling
them
to
spread
desolation
among
us
and
take
our
places
it
had
been
in
her
manner
all
along
she
was
like
fate
like
the
abominable
fate
that
desolates
the
whole
length
of
our
lives
that
leaves
of
our
hopes
of
our
plans
nothing
but
a
hideous
jumble
of
fragments
like
those
of
statues
smashed
by
hammers
the
senseless
inscrutable
joyless
fate
that
we
hate
and
that
debases
us
forever
and
ever
she
had
been
all
that
to
me
and
to
how
many
more
i
used
to
be
a
decent
personality
i
vociferated
at
him
do
you
hear
decent
i
could
look
a
man
in
the
face
and
you
can
not
even
enjoy
what
do
you
come
for
what
do
you
live
for
what
is
at
the
end
of
it
all
ah
if
i
knew
he
answered
negligently
chapter
nineteen
i
wanted
to
see
her
to
finish
it
one
way
or
another
and
at
my
house
i
found
her
standing
in
an
immense
white
room
waiting
for
me
there
was
a
profusion
of
light
it
left
her
absolutely
shadowless
like
a
white
statue
in
a
gallery
inscrutable
i
have
come
i
said
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
say
because
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
on
earth
but
i
did
not
i
looked
at
her
instead
you
have
come
she
repeated
she
had
no
expression
in
her
voice
in
her
eyes
it
was
as
if
i
were
nothing
to
her
as
if
i
were
the
picture
of
a
man
well
that
was
it
i
was
a
picture
she
a
statue
i
did
it
i
said
at
last
and
you
want
she
asked
you
know
i
answered
i
want
my
i
could
not
think
of
the
word
it
was
either
a
reward
or
a
just
due
she
looked
at
me
quite
suddenly
it
made
an
effect
as
if
the
venus
of
milo
had
turned
its
head
toward
me
she
began
to
speak
as
if
the
statue
were
speaking
as
if
a
passing
bell
were
speaking
recording
a
passing
passionlessly
you
have
done
nothing
at
all
she
said
nothing
and
yet
i
said
i
was
at
the
heart
of
it
all
nothing
at
all
she
repeated
you
were
at
the
heart
yes
but
at
the
heart
of
a
machine
her
words
carried
a
sort
of
strong
conviction
i
seemed
suddenly
to
see
an
immense
machine
unconcerned
soulless
but
all
its
parts
made
up
of
bodies
of
men
a
great
mill
grinding
out
the
dust
of
centuries
a
great
she
was
continuing
her
speech
as
for
you
you
are
only
a
detail
like
all
the
others
you
were
set
in
a
place
because
you
would
act
as
you
did
it
was
in
your
character
we
inherit
the
earth
and
you
your
day
is
over
you
remember
that
day
when
i
found
you
the
first
day
i
remembered
that
day
it
was
on
the
downland
under
the
immense
sky
amid
the
sound
of
larks
she
had
explained
the
nature
of
things
she
had
talked
expressionlessly
in
pregnant
words
she
was
talking
now
i
knew
no
more
of
her
after
all
these
days
after
i
had
given
up
to
her
my
past
and
my
future
you
remember
that
day
i
was
looking
for
such
a
man
and
i
found
you
and
you
i
said
you
have
done
this
thing
think
of
it
i
have
nobody
nothing
nowhere
in
the
world
i
can
not
look
a
man
in
the
face
not
even
churchill
i
can
never
go
to
him
again
i
paused
expecting
a
sign
of
softening
none
came
i
have
parted
with
my
past
and
you
tell
me
there
is
no
future
none
she
echoed
then
coldly
as
a
swan
takes
the
water
she
began
to
speak
well
yes
i
hurt
you
you
have
suffered
and
in
your
pain
you
think
me
vile
but
remember
that
for
ages
the
virtue
of
has
been
the
vileness
of
that
which
outstrips
one
one
calls
vile
my
virtue
lies
in
gaining
my
end
pity
for
you
would
have
been
a
crime
for
me
you
have
suffered
and
then
what
are
you
to
me
as
i
came
among
you
i
am
that
is
where
i
am
triumphant
and
virtuous
i
have
succeeded
when
i
came
here
i
came
into
a
world
of
of
shadows
of
men
what
were
their
passions
their
joys
their
fears
their
despair
their
outcry
to
me
if
i
had
ears
my
virtue
was
to
close
them
to
the
cries
there
was
no
other
way
there
was
one
of
us
your
friend
fox
i
mean
he
came
into
the
world
but
had
not
the
virtue
to
hold
himself
aloof
he
has
told
you
goes
blind
down
here
he
began
to
feel
a
little
like
the
people
round
him
he
contracted
likings
and
dislikings
he
liked
you
and
you
betrayed
him
so
he
went
under
he
grew
blind
down
here
i
have
not
grown
blind
i
see
as
i
saw
i
move
as
i
did
in
a
world
of
of
the
pictures
of
men
they
despair
i
hear
groans
well
they
are
the
groans
of
the
dead
to
me
this
to
you
down
near
it
is
a
mass
of
tortuous
intrigue
vile
in
its
pettiest
detail
but
come
further
off
stand
beside
me
and
what
does
it
look
like
it
is
a
mighty
engine
of
disintegration
it
has
crushed
out
a
whole
fabric
a
whole
plane
of
society
it
has
done
that
i
guided
it
i
had
to
have
my
eyes
on
every
little
strand
of
it
to
be
forever
on
the
watch
and
now
i
stand
alone
yesterday
that
fabric
was
everything
to
you
it
seemed
solid
enough
and
where
is
it
what
is
it
to
you
more
than
to
me
there
stood
virtue
and
probity
and
all
the
things
that
all
those
people
stood
for
well
they
are
gone
the
very
belief
in
them
is
gone
who
will
believe
in
them
now
that
it
is
proved
that
their
tools
were
people
like
de
mersch
and
it
was
i
that
did
it
that
too
is
to
be
accounted
to
me
for
virtue
well
i
have
inherited
the
earth
i
am
the
worm
at
the
very
heart
of
the
rose
of
it
you
are
thinking
that
all
that
i
have
gained
is
the
hand
of
gurnard
but
it
is
more
than
that
it
is
a
matter
of
a
and
gurnard
is
the
only
piece
that
remains
and
i
am
the
hand
that
moves
him
as
for
a
marriage
well
it
is
a
marriage
of
minds
a
union
for
a
common
purpose
but
mine
is
the
master
mind
as
for
you
well
you
have
parted
with
your
past
and
there
is
no
future
for
you
that
is
true
you
have
nowhere
to
go
to
have
nothing
left
nothing
in
the
world
that
is
true
too
but
what
is
that
to
me
a
set
of
facts
that
you
have
parted
with
your
past
and
have
no
future
you
had
to
do
the
work
i
had
to
make
you
do
it
i
chose
you
because
you
would
do
it
that
is
all
i
knew
you
knew
your
secret
places
your
weaknesses
that
is
my
power
i
stand
for
the
inevitable
for
the
future
that
goes
on
its
way
you
for
the
past
that
lies
by
the
roadside
if
for
your
sake
i
had
swerved
one
jot
from
my
allotted
course
i
should
have
been
untrue
there
was
a
danger
once
for
a
minute
but
i
stood
out
against
it
what
would
you
have
had
me
do
go
under
as
fox
went
under
speak
like
him
look
as
he
looks
now
me
well
i
did
not
i
was
in
the
hands
of
the
future
i
never
swerved
i
went
on
my
way
i
had
to
judge
men
as
i
judged
you
to
corrupt
as
i
corrupted
you
i
cajoled
i
bribed
i
held
out
hopes
and
with
every
one
as
with
you
i
succeeded
it
is
in
that
power
that
the
secret
of
the
greatness
which
is
virtue
lies
i
had
to
set
about
a
work
of
art
of
an
art
strange
to
you
as
strange
as
alien
as
the
arts
of
dead
peoples
you
are
the
dead
now
mine
the
art
of
an
ensuing
day
all
that
remains
to
you
is
to
fold
your
hands
and
wonder
as
you
wondered
before
the
gates
of
nineveh
i
had
to
sound
the
knell
of
the
old
order
of
your
virtues
of
your
honours
of
your
faiths
of
of
altruism
if
you
like
well
it
is
sounded
i
was
forever
on
the
watch
i
foresaw
i
forestalled
i
have
never
rested
and
you
and
i
i
said
i
only
loved
you
there
was
a
silence
i
seemed
for
a
moment
to
see
myself
a
tenuous
bodiless
thing
like
a
ghost
in
a
bottomless
cleft
between
the
past
and
the
to
come
and
i
was
to
be
that
forever
you
only
loved
me
she
repeated
yes
you
loved
me
but
what
claim
upon
me
does
that
give
you
you
loved
me
well
if
i
had
loved
you
it
would
have
given
you
a
claim
all
your
misery
your
heartache
comes
from
from
love
your
love
for
me
your
love
for
the
things
of
the
past
for
what
was
doomed
you
loved
the
others
too
in
a
way
and
you
betrayed
them
and
you
are
wretched
if
you
had
not
loved
them
you
would
not
be
wretched
now
if
you
had
not
loved
me
you
would
not
have
betrayed
your
your
very
self
at
the
first
you
stood
alone
as
much
alone
as
i
all
these
people
were
nothing
to
you
i
was
nothing
to
you
but
you
must
needs
love
them
and
me
you
should
have
let
them
remain
nothing
to
the
end
but
you
did
not
what
were
they
to
you
shapes
shadows
on
a
sheet
they
looked
real
but
were
they
any
one
of
them
you
will
never
see
them
again
you
will
never
see
me
again
we
shall
be
all
parts
of
a
past
of
shadows
if
you
had
been
as
i
am
you
could
have
looked
back
upon
them
unmoved
or
could
have
forgotten
but
you
only
loved
and
you
will
have
no
more
ease
and
even
now
it
is
only
yourself
that
matters
it
is
because
you
broke
because
you
were
false
to
your
standards
at
a
supreme
moment
because
you
have
discovered
that
your
honour
will
not
help
you
to
stand
a
strain
it
is
not
the
thought
of
the
harm
you
have
done
the
others
what
are
they
what
is
churchill
who
has
fallen
or
fox
who
is
dead
to
you
now
it
is
yourself
that
you
bemoan
that
is
your
tragedy
that
you
can
never
go
again
to
churchill
with
the
old
look
in
your
eyes
that
you
can
never
go
to
anyone
for
fear
of
contempt
oh
i
know
you
i
know
you
she
knew
me
it
was
true
what
she
said
i
had
had
my
eyes
on
the
ground
all
this
while
now
i
looked
at
her
trying
to
realise
that
i
should
never
see
her
again
it
was
impossible
there
was
that
intense
beauty
that
shadowlessness
that
was
like
translucence
and
there
was
her
voice
it
was
impossible
to
understand
that
i
was
never
to
see
her
again
never
to
hear
her
voice
after
this
she
was
silent
for
a
long
time
and
i
said
nothing
nothing
at
all
it
was
the
thought
of
her
making
fox
end
of
her
sitting
as
fox
had
sat
hopelessly
lifelessly
like
a
man
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
world
at
last
she
said
there
is
no
hope
we
have
to
go
our
ways
you
yours
i
mine
and
then
if
you
will
if
you
can
not
forget
you
may
remember
that
i
cared
that
for
a
moment
in
between
two
breaths
i
thought
of
of
failing
that
is
all
i
can
do
for
your
sake
that
silenced
me
even
if
i
could
have
spoken
to
any
purpose
i
would
have
held
my
tongue
now
i
had
not
looked
at
her
but
stood
with
my
eyes
averted
very
conscious
of
her
standing
before
me
of
her
great
beauty
of
her
great
glory
after
a
long
time
i
went
away
i
never
saw
her
again
i
never
saw
any
one
of
them
all
again
fox
was
dead
and
churchill
i
have
never
had
the
heart
to
face
that
was
the
end
of
all
that
part
of
my
life
it
passed
away
and
left
me
only
a
consciousness
of
weakness
and
and
regrets
she
remains
one
recognises
her
hand
in
the
trend
of
events
well
it
is
not
a
very
gay
world
gurnard
they
say
is
the
type
of
the
age
of
its
spirit
and
they
say
that
i
the
granger
of
etchingham
am
not
on
terms
with
my
