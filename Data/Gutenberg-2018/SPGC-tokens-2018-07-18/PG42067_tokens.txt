preface
in
the
last
part
of
this
work
we
examined
the
figure
of
the
dying
and
reviving
god
as
it
appears
in
the
oriental
religions
of
classical
antiquity
with
the
present
instalment
of
golden
we
pursue
the
same
theme
in
other
religions
and
among
other
races
passing
from
the
east
to
europe
we
begin
with
the
religion
of
ancient
greece
which
embodies
the
now
familiar
conception
in
two
typical
examples
the
dionysus
and
the
persephone
with
her
mother
and
duplicate
demeter
both
of
these
greek
divinities
are
personifications
of
cultivated
plants
and
a
consideration
of
them
naturally
leads
us
on
to
investigate
similar
personifications
elsewhere
now
of
all
the
plants
which
men
have
artificially
reared
for
the
sake
of
food
the
cereals
are
on
the
whole
the
most
important
therefore
it
is
natural
that
the
religion
of
primitive
agricultural
communities
should
be
deeply
coloured
by
the
principal
occupation
of
their
lives
the
care
of
the
corn
hence
the
frequency
with
which
the
figures
of
the
and
answering
to
the
demeter
and
persephone
of
ancient
greece
meet
us
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
not
least
of
all
on
the
of
modern
europe
but
edible
roots
as
well
as
cereals
have
been
cultivated
by
many
races
especially
in
the
tropical
regions
as
a
subsidiary
or
even
as
a
principal
means
of
subsistence
and
accordingly
they
too
enter
largely
into
the
religious
ideas
of
the
peoples
who
live
by
them
yet
in
the
case
of
the
roots
such
as
yams
taro
and
potatoes
the
conception
of
the
dying
and
reviving
god
appears
to
figure
less
prominently
than
in
the
case
of
the
cereals
perhaps
for
the
simple
reason
that
while
the
growth
and
decay
of
the
one
sort
of
fruit
go
on
above
ground
for
all
to
see
the
similar
processes
of
the
other
are
hidden
under
ground
and
therefore
strike
the
popular
imagination
less
forcibly
having
surveyed
the
variations
of
our
main
theme
among
the
agricultural
races
of
mankind
we
prosecute
the
enquiry
among
savages
who
remain
more
or
less
completely
in
the
hunting
fishing
and
pastoral
stages
of
society
the
same
motive
which
leads
the
primitive
husbandman
to
adore
the
corn
or
the
roots
induces
the
primitive
hunter
fowler
fisher
or
herdsman
to
adore
the
beasts
birds
or
fishes
which
furnish
him
with
the
means
of
subsistence
to
him
the
conception
of
the
death
of
these
worshipful
beings
is
naturally
presented
with
singular
force
and
distinctness
since
it
is
no
figurative
or
allegorical
death
no
poetical
embroidery
thrown
over
the
skeleton
but
the
real
death
the
naked
skeleton
that
constantly
thrusts
itself
importunately
on
his
attention
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
us
civilised
men
the
notion
of
the
immortality
and
even
of
the
resurrection
of
the
lower
animals
appears
to
be
almost
as
familiar
to
the
savage
and
to
be
accepted
by
him
with
nearly
as
unwavering
a
faith
as
the
obvious
fact
of
their
death
and
destruction
for
the
most
part
he
assumes
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
souls
of
dead
animals
survive
their
decease
hence
much
of
the
thought
of
the
savage
hunter
is
devoted
to
the
problem
of
how
he
can
best
appease
the
naturally
incensed
ghosts
of
his
victims
so
as
to
prevent
them
from
doing
him
a
mischief
this
refusal
of
the
savage
to
recognise
in
death
a
final
cessation
of
the
vital
process
this
unquestioning
faith
in
the
unbroken
continuity
of
all
life
is
a
fact
that
has
not
yet
received
the
attention
which
it
seems
to
merit
from
enquirers
into
the
constitution
of
the
human
mind
as
well
as
into
the
history
of
religion
in
the
following
pages
i
have
collected
examples
of
this
curious
faith
i
must
leave
it
to
others
to
appraise
them
thus
on
the
whole
we
are
concerned
in
these
volumes
with
the
reverence
or
worship
paid
by
men
to
the
natural
resources
from
which
they
draw
their
nutriment
both
vegetable
and
animal
that
they
should
invest
these
resources
with
an
atmosphere
of
wonder
and
awe
often
indeed
with
a
halo
of
divinity
is
no
matter
for
surprise
the
circle
of
human
knowledge
illuminated
by
the
pale
cold
light
of
reason
is
so
infinitesimally
small
the
dark
regions
of
human
ignorance
which
lie
beyond
that
luminous
ring
are
so
immeasurably
vast
that
imagination
is
fain
to
step
up
to
the
border
line
and
send
the
warm
richly
coloured
beams
of
her
fairy
lantern
streaming
out
into
the
darkness
and
so
peering
into
the
gloom
she
is
apt
to
mistake
the
shadowy
reflections
of
her
own
figure
for
real
beings
moving
in
the
abyss
in
short
few
men
are
sensible
of
the
sharp
line
that
divides
the
known
from
the
unknown
to
most
men
it
is
a
hazy
borderland
where
perception
and
conception
melt
indissolubly
into
one
hence
to
the
savage
the
ghosts
of
dead
animals
and
men
with
which
his
imagination
peoples
the
void
are
hardly
less
real
than
the
solid
shapes
which
the
living
animals
and
men
present
to
his
senses
and
his
thoughts
and
activities
are
nearly
as
much
absorbed
by
the
one
as
by
the
other
of
him
it
may
be
said
with
perhaps
even
greater
truth
than
of
his
civilised
brother
what
shadows
we
are
and
what
shadows
we
pursue
but
having
said
so
much
in
this
book
of
the
misty
glory
which
the
human
imagination
sheds
round
the
hard
material
realities
of
the
food
supply
i
am
unwilling
to
leave
my
readers
under
the
impression
natural
but
erroneous
that
man
has
created
most
of
his
gods
out
of
his
belly
that
is
not
so
at
least
that
is
not
my
reading
of
the
history
of
religion
among
the
visible
tangible
perceptible
elements
by
which
he
is
it
is
only
of
these
that
i
presume
to
are
others
than
the
merely
nutritious
which
have
exerted
a
powerful
influence
in
touching
his
imagination
and
stimulating
his
energies
and
so
have
contributed
to
build
up
the
complex
fabric
of
religion
to
the
preservation
of
the
species
the
reproductive
faculties
are
no
less
essential
than
the
nutritive
and
with
them
we
enter
on
a
very
different
sphere
of
thought
and
feeling
to
wit
the
relation
of
the
sexes
to
each
other
with
all
the
depths
of
tenderness
and
all
the
intricate
problems
which
that
mysterious
relation
involves
the
study
of
the
various
forms
some
gross
and
palpable
some
subtle
and
elusive
in
which
the
sexual
instinct
has
moulded
the
religious
consciousness
of
our
race
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
as
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
delicate
tasks
which
await
the
future
historian
of
religion
but
the
influence
which
the
sexes
exert
on
each
other
intimate
and
profound
as
it
has
been
and
must
always
be
is
far
indeed
from
exhausting
the
forces
of
attraction
by
which
mankind
are
bound
together
in
society
the
need
of
mutual
protection
the
economic
advantages
of
the
contagion
of
example
the
communication
of
knowledge
the
great
ideas
that
radiate
from
great
minds
like
shafts
of
light
from
high
towers
and
many
other
things
combine
to
draw
men
into
communities
to
drill
them
into
regiments
and
to
set
them
marching
on
the
road
of
progress
with
a
concentrated
force
to
which
the
loose
skirmishers
of
mere
anarchy
and
individualism
can
never
hope
to
oppose
a
permanent
resistance
hence
when
we
consider
how
intimately
humanity
depends
on
society
for
many
of
the
boons
which
it
prizes
most
highly
we
shall
probably
admit
that
of
all
the
forces
open
to
our
observation
which
have
shaped
human
destiny
the
influence
of
man
on
man
is
by
far
the
greatest
if
that
is
so
it
seems
to
follow
that
among
the
beings
real
or
imaginary
which
the
religious
imagination
has
clothed
with
the
attributes
of
divinity
human
spirits
are
likely
to
play
a
more
important
part
than
the
spirits
of
plants
animals
or
inanimate
objects
i
believe
that
a
careful
examination
of
the
evidence
which
has
still
to
be
undertaken
will
confirm
this
conclusion
and
that
if
we
could
strictly
interrogate
the
phantoms
which
the
human
mind
has
conjured
up
out
of
the
depths
of
its
bottomless
ignorance
and
enshrined
as
deities
in
the
dim
light
of
temples
we
should
find
that
the
majority
of
them
have
been
nothing
but
the
ghosts
of
dead
men
however
to
say
this
is
necessarily
to
anticipate
the
result
of
future
research
and
if
in
saying
it
i
have
ventured
to
make
a
prediction
which
like
all
predictions
is
liable
to
be
falsified
by
the
event
i
have
done
so
only
from
a
fear
lest
without
some
such
warning
the
numerous
facts
recorded
in
these
volumes
might
lend
themselves
to
an
exaggerated
estimate
of
their
own
importance
and
hence
to
a
misinterpretation
and
distortion
of
history
frazer

may
chapter
dionysus
in
the
preceding
part
of
this
work
we
saw
that
in
antiquity
the
civilised
nations
of
western
asia
and
egypt
pictured
to
themselves
the
changes
of
the
seasons
and
particularly
the
annual
growth
and
decay
of
vegetation
as
episodes
in
the
life
of
gods
whose
mournful
death
and
happy
resurrection
they
celebrated
with
dramatic
rites
of
alternate
lamentation
and
rejoicing
but
if
the
celebration
was
in
form
dramatic
it
was
in
substance
magical
that
is
to
say
it
was
intended
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
to
ensure
the
vernal
regeneration
of
plants
and
the
multiplication
of
animals
which
had
seemed
to
be
menaced
by
the
inroads
of
winter
in
the
ancient
world
however
such
ideas
and
such
rites
were
by
no
means
confined
to
the
oriental
peoples
of
babylon
and
syria
of
phrygia
and
egypt
they
were
not
a
product
peculiar
to
the
religious
mysticism
of
the
dreamy
east
but
were
shared
by
the
races
of
livelier
fancy
and
more
mercurial
temperament
who
inhabited
the
shores
and
islands
of
the
aegean
we
need
not
with
some
enquirers
in
ancient
and
modern
times
suppose
that
these
western
peoples
borrowed
from
the
older
civilisation
of
the
orient
the
conception
of
the
dying
and
reviving
god
together
with
the
solemn
ritual
in
which
that
conception
was
dramatically
set
forth
before
the
eyes
of
the
worshippers
more
probably
the
resemblance
which
may
be
traced
in
this
respect
between
the
religions
of
the
east
and
the
west
is
no
more
than
what
we
commonly
though
incorrectly
call
a
fortuitous
coincidence
the
effect
of
similar
causes
acting
alike
on
the
similar
constitution
of
the
human
mind
in
different
countries
and
under
different
skies
the
greek
had
no
need
to
journey
into
far
countries
to
learn
the
vicissitudes
of
the
seasons
to
mark
the
fleeting
beauty
of
the
damask
rose
the
transient
glory
of
the
golden
corn
the
passing
splendour
of
the
purple
grapes
year
by
year
in
his
own
beautiful
land
he
beheld
with
natural
regret
the
bright
pomp
of
summer
fading
into
the
gloom
and
stagnation
of
winter
and
year
by
year
he
hailed
with
natural
delight
the
outburst
of
fresh
life
in
spring
accustomed
to
personify
the
forces
of
nature
to
tinge
her
cold
abstractions
with
the
warm
hues
of
imagination
to
clothe
her
naked
realities
with
the
gorgeous
drapery
of
a
mythic
fancy
he
fashioned
for
himself
a
train
of
gods
and
goddesses
of
spirits
and
elves
out
of
the
shifting
panorama
of
the
seasons
and
followed
the
annual
fluctuations
of
their
fortunes
with
alternate
emotions
of
cheerfulness
and
dejection
of
gladness
and
sorrow
which
found
their
natural
expression
in
alternate
rites
of
rejoicing
and
lamentation
of
revelry
and
mourning
a
consideration
of
some
of
the
greek
divinities
who
thus
died
and
rose
again
from
the
dead
may
furnish
us
with
a
series
of
companion
pictures
to
set
side
by
side
with
the
sad
figures
of
adonis
attis
and
osiris
we
begin
with
dionysus
the
god
dionysus
or
bacchus
is
best
known
to
us
as
a
personification
of
the
vine
and
of
the
exhilaration
produced
by
the
juice
of
the
grape
his
ecstatic
worship
characterised
by
wild
dances
thrilling
music
and
tipsy
excess
appears
to
have
originated
among
the
rude
tribes
of
thrace
who
were
notoriously
addicted
to
drunkenness
its
mystic
doctrines
and
extravagant
rites
were
essentially
foreign
to
the
clear
intelligence
and
sober
temperament
of
the
greek
race
yet
appealing
as
it
did
to
that
love
of
mystery
and
that
proneness
to
revert
to
savagery
which
seem
to
be
innate
in
most
men
the
religion
spread
like
wildfire
through
greece
until
the
god
whom
homer
hardly
deigned
to
notice
had
become
the
most
popular
figure
of
the
pantheon
the
resemblance
which
his
story
and
his
ceremonies
present
to
those
of
osiris
have
led
some
enquirers
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
to
hold
that
dionysus
was
merely
a
disguised
osiris
imported
directly
from
egypt
into
greece
but
the
great
preponderance
of
evidence
points
to
his
thracian
origin
and
the
similarity
of
the
two
worships
is
sufficiently
explained
by
the
similarity
of
the
ideas
and
customs
on
which
they
were
founded
while
the
vine
with
its
clusters
was
the
most
characteristic
manifestation
of
dionysus
he
was
also
a
god
of
trees
in
general
thus
we
are
told
that
almost
all
the
greeks
sacrificed
to
dionysus
of
the
in
boeotia
one
of
his
titles
was
dionysus
in
the
his
image
was
often
merely
an
upright
post
without
arms
but
draped
in
a
mantle
with
a
bearded
mask
to
represent
the
head
and
with
leafy
boughs
projecting
from
the
head
or
body
to
shew
the
nature
of
the
deity
on
a
vase
his
rude
effigy
is
depicted
appearing
out
of
a
low
tree
or
bush
at
magnesia
on
the
maeander
an
image
of
dionysus
is
said
to
have
been
found
in
a
which
had
been
broken
by
the
wind
he
was
the
patron
of
cultivated
trees
prayers
were
offered
to
him
that
he
would
make
the
trees
grow
and
he
was
especially
honoured
by
husbandmen
chiefly
who
set
up
an
image
of
him
in
the
shape
of
a
natural
in
their
orchards
he
was
said
to
have
discovered
all
amongst
which
apples
and
figs
are
particularly
mentioned
and
he
was
referred
to
as
he
of
the
green
fruit
and
making
the
fruit
to
one
of
his
titles
was
teeming
or
bursting
as
of
sap
or
blossoms
and
there
was
a
flowery
dionysus
in
attica
and
at
patrae
in
achaia
the
athenians
sacrificed
to
him
for
the
prosperity
of
the
fruits
of
the
land
amongst
the
trees
particularly
sacred
to
him
in
addition
to
the
vine
was
the
the
delphic
oracle
commanded
the
corinthians
to
worship
a
particular
equally
with
the
god
so
they
made
two
images
of
dionysus
out
of

and

bodies
in

a
wand
tipped
with
a

commonly
carried
by
the
god
or
his
worshippers
again
the
ivy
and
the
were
especially
associated
with
him
in
the
attic
township
of
acharnae
there
was
a
dionysus
ivy
at
lacedaemon
there
was
a
fig
dionysus
and
in
naxos
where
figs
were
called
there
was
a
dionysus
meilichios
the
face
of
whose
image
was
made
of
further
there
are
indications
few
but
significant
that
dionysus
was
conceived
as
a
deity
of
agriculture
and
the
corn
he
is
spoken
of
as
himself
doing
the
work
of
a
husbandman
he
is
reported
to
have
been
the
first
to
yoke
oxen
to
the
plough
which
before
had
been
dragged
by
hand
alone
and
some
people
found
in
this
tradition
the
clue
to
the
bovine
shape
in
which
as
we
shall
see
the
god
was
often
supposed
to
present
himself
to
his
worshippers
thus
guiding
the
ploughshare
and
scattering
the
seed
as
he
went
dionysus
is
said
to
have
eased
the
labour
of
the
husbandman
further
we
are
told
that
in
the
land
of
the
bisaltae
a
thracian
tribe
there
was
a
great
and
fair
sanctuary
of
dionysus
where
at
his
festival
a
bright
light
shone
forth
at
night
as
a
token
of
an
abundant
harvest
vouchsafed
by
the
deity
but
if
the
crops
were
to
fail
that
year
the
mystic
light
was
not
seen
darkness
brooded
over
the
sanctuary
as
at
other
times
moreover
among
the
emblems
of
dionysus
was
the
that
is
the
large
open
basket
which
down
to
modern
times
has
been
used
by
farmers
to
separate
the
grain
from
the
chaff
by
tossing
the
corn
in
the
air
this
simple
agricultural
instrument
figured
in
the
mystic
rites
of
dionysus
indeed
the
god
is
traditionally
said
to
have
been
placed
at
birth
in
a
as
in
a
cradle
in
art
he
is
represented
as
an
infant
so
cradled
and
from
these
traditions
and
representations
he
derived
the
epithet
of
that
is
he
of
the
at
first
sight
this
symbolism
might
be
explained
very
simply
and
naturally
by
supposing
that
the
divine
infant
cradled
in
the
was
identified
with
the
corn
which
it
is
the
function
of
the
instrument
to
winnow
and
sift
yet
against
this
identification
it
may
be
urged
with
reason
that
the
use
of
a
as
a
cradle
was
not
peculiar
to
dionysus
it
was
a
regular
practice
with
the
ancient
greeks
to
place
their
infants
in
as
an
omen
of
wealth
and
fertility
for
the
future
life
of
the
children
customs
of
the
same
sort
have
been
observed
apparently
for
similar
reasons
by
other
peoples
in
other
lands
for
example
in
java
it
is
or
used
to
be
customary
to
place
every
child
at
birth
in
a
bamboo
basket
like
the
sieve
or
which
javanese
farmers
use
for
separating
the
rice
from
the
chaff
it
is
the
midwife
who
places
the
child
in
the
basket
and
as
she
does
so
she
suddenly
knocks
with
the
palms
of
both
hands
on
the
basket
in
order
that
the
child
may
not
be
timid
and
fearful
then
she
addresses
the
child
thus
cry
not
for
and
two
spirits
are
watching
over
next
she
addresses
these
two
spirits
saying
bring
not
your
grandchild
to
the
road
lest
he
be
trampled
by
a
horse
bring
him
not
to
the
bank
of
the
river
lest
he
fall
into
the
the
object
of
the
ceremony
is
said
to
be
that
these
two
spirits
should
always
and
everywhere
guard
the
child
on
the
first
anniversary
of
a
child
s
birthday
the
chinese
of
set
the
little
one
in
a
large
bamboo
sieve
such
as
farmers
employ
in
winnowing
grain
and
in
the
sieve
they
place
along
with
the
child
a
variety
of
articles
such
as
fruits
gold
or
silver
ornaments
a
set
of
books
a
pencil
pen
ink
paper
and
so
on
and
they
draw
omens
of
the
child
s
future
career
from
the
object
which
it
first
handles
and
plays
with
thus
if
the
infant
first
grasps
the
he
will
be
wealthy
if
he
seizes
on
a
book
he
will
be
learned
and
so
forth
in
the
bilaspore
district
of
india
it
is
customary
for
people
to
place
a
newborn
infant
in
a
filled
with
rice
and
afterwards
to
give
the
grain
to
the
nurse
in
attendance
in
upper
egypt
a
babe
is
immediately
laid
upon
a
and
corn
is
scattered
around
it
moreover
on
the
seventh
day
after
birth
the
infant
is
carried
on
a
sieve
through
the
whole
house
while
the
midwife
scatters
wheat
barley
pease
and
salt
the
intention
of
these
ceremonies
is
said
to
be
to
avert
evil
spirits
from
the
child
and
a
like
motive
is
assigned
by
other
peoples
for
the
practice
of
placing
newborn
infants
in
a
or
for
example
in
the
punjaub
when
several
children
of
a
family
have
died
in
succession
a
new
baby
will
sometimes
be
put
at
birth
into
an
old
along
with
the
sweepings
of
the
house
and
so
dragged
out
into
the
yard
such
a
child
may
like
dionysus
in
after
life
be
known
by
the
name
of
or
dragged
the
object
of
treating
the
child
in
this
way
seems
to
be
to
save
its
life
by
deceiving
the
spirits
who
are
supposed
to
have
carried
off
its
elder
brothers
and
sisters
these
malevolent
beings
are
on
the
for
the
new
baby
but
they
will
never
think
of
raking
for
it
in
the
that
being
the
last
place
where
they
would
expect
to
find
the
hope
of
the
family
the
same
may
perhaps
be
the
intention
of
a
ceremony
observed
by
the
gaolis
of
the
deccan
as
soon
as
a
child
is
born
it
is
bathed
and
then
placed
on
a
sieve
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
fifth
day
the
sieve
with
a
lime
and
leaves
on
it
is
removed
outside
the
house
and
then
after
the
worship
of
chetti
has
been
performed
the
sieve
is
thrown
away
on
the
road
again
the
same
notion
of
rescuing
the
child
from
dangerous
spirits
comes
out
very
clearly
in
a
similar
custom
observed
by
the
natives
of
laos
a
province
of
siam
these
people
believe
that
an
infant
is
the
child
not
of
its
parents
but
of
the
spirits
and
in
this
belief
they
go
through
the
following
formalities
as
soon
as
an
infant
is
born
it
is
bathed
and
dressed
laid
upon
a
and
the
grandmother
if
present
if
not
by
the
next
near
female
the
head
of
the
stairs
or
of
the
ladder
leading
to
the
house
the
person
performing
this
duty
calls
out
in
a
loud
tone
to
the
spirits
to
come
and
take
the
child
away
or
for
ever
after
to
let
it
alone
at
the
same
moment
she
stamps
violently
on
the
floor
to
frighten
the
child
or
give
it
a
jerk
and
make
it
cry
if
it
does
not
cry
this
is
regarded
as
an
evil
omen
if
on
the
other
hand
it
follows
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
and
begins
to
exercise
its
vocal
organs
it
is
supposed
to
have
a
happy
and
prosperous
life
before
it
sometimes
the
spirits
do
come
and
take
the
infant
away
it
dies
before
it
is
hours
old
but
to
prevent
such
a
calamity
strings
are
tied
round
its
wrists
on
the
first
night
after
its
birth
and
if
it
sickens
or
is
feeble
the
are
called
in
to
prescribe
certain
offerings
to
be
made
to
keep
away
the
very
spirits
who
only
a
few
hours
previously
were
ceremoniously
called
upon
to
come
and
carry
the
child
off
on
the
day
after
its
birth
the
child
is
regarded
as
being
the
property
no
longer
of
the
spirits
who
could
have
taken
it
if
they
had
wanted
it
but
of
the
parents
who
forthwith
sell
it
to
some
relation
for
a
nominal
eighth
or
a
quarter
of
a
rupee
perhaps
this
again
is
a
further
guarantee
against
molestation
by
the
spirits
who
apparently
are
regarded
as
honest
folk
that
would
not
stoop
to
take
what
has
been
bought
and
paid
a
like
intention
of
averting
evil
in
some
shape
from
a
child
is
assigned
in
other
cases
of
the
same
custom
thus
in
travancore
if
an
infant
is
observed
to
distort
its
limbs
as
if
in
pain
it
is
supposed
to
be
under
the
pressure
of
some
one
who
has
stooped
over
it
to
relieve
which
the
mother
places
it
with
a
on
a
winnowing
fan
and
shakes
it
three
or
four
again
among
the
tanala
people
of
madagascar
almost
all
children
born
in
the
unlucky
month
of
faosa
are
buried
alive
in
the
forest
but
if
the
parents
resolve
to
let
the
child
live
they
must
call
in
the
aid
of
a
diviner
who
performs
a
ceremony
for
averting
the
threatened
the
child
is
placed
in
a
along
with
certain
herbs
further
the
diviner
takes
herbs
of
the
same
sort
a
spade
and
an
axe
fastens
them
to
the
father
s
spear
and
sets
the
spear
up
in
the
ground
then
the
child
is
bathed
in
water
which
has
been
medicated
with
some
of
the
same
herbs
finally
the
diviner
says
the
spade
to
the
grandchild
may
it
the
child
not
despoil
its
father
may
it
not
despoil
its
mother
may
it
not
despoil
the
children
let
it
be
this
ceremony
we
are
told
puts
an
end
to
the
child
s
evil
days
and
the
father
gets
the
spear
to
put
away
all
evil
the
child
then
joins
its
father
and
mother
its
evil
days
are
averted
and
the
water
and
the
other
things
are
buried
for
they
account
them
similarly
the
ancient
greeks
used
to
bury
or
throw
into
the
sea
or
deposit
at
the
things
that
had
been
used
in
ceremonies
of
purification
no
doubt
because
the
things
were
supposed
to
be
tainted
by
the
evil
which
had
been
transferred
to
them
in
the
rites
another
example
of
the
use
of
a
in
what
may
be
called
a
purificatory
ceremony
is
furnished
by
the
practice
of
the
chinese
of
a
lad
who
is
suffering
from
is
made
to
squat
in
a
large
winnowing
sieve
on
his
head
is
placed
a
piece
of
red
cloth
and
on
the
cloth
are
laid
some
parched
beans
which
are
then
allowed
to
roll
off
as
the
name
for
beans
pronounced
in
the
local
dialect
is
identical
with
the
common
name
for
and
as
moreover
the
scars
left
by
the
pustules
are
thought
to
resemble
beans
it
appears
to
be
imagined
that
just
as
the
beans
roll
off
the
boy
s
head
so
will
the
pustules
vanish
from
his
body
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
thus
the
cure
depends
on
the
principle
of
homoeopathic
magic
perhaps
on
the
same
principle
a
is
employed
in
the
ceremony
from
a
notion
that
it
will
help
to
waft
or
fan
away
the
disease
like
chaff
from
the
grain
we
may
compare
a
purificatory
ceremony
observed
by
the
karens
of
burma
at
the
naming
of
a
child
amongst
these
people
children
are
supposed
to
come
into
the
world
defiled
and
unless
that
defilement
is
removed
they
will
be
unfortunate
and
unsuccessful
in
their
undertakings
an
elder
takes
a
thin
splint
of
bamboo
and
tying
a
noose
at
one
end
he
fans
it
down
the
child
s
arm
saying
away
ill
luck
fan
away
ill
success
away
inability
fan
away
unskilfulness
away
slow
growth
fan
away
difficulty
of

away
stuntedness

away
puniness
away
drowsiness
fan
away
stupidity
away
debasedness
fan
away

away
the
whole
the
elder
now
changes
his
motion
and
fans
up
the
child

arm
saying
on

on

on
the
paddy
bin

the
paddy
barn
on

things
fan
on
appropriate
thus
in
some
of
the
foregoing
instances
the
employment
of
the
may
have
been
suggested
by
the
proper
use
of
the
implement
as
a
means
of
separating
the
corn
from
the
chaff
the
same
operation
being
extended
by
analogy
to
rid
men
of
evils
of
various
sorts
which
would
otherwise
adhere
to
them
like
husks
to
the
grain
it
was
in
this
way
that
the
ancients
explained
the
use
of
the
in
the
mysteries
but
one
motive
and
perhaps
the
original
one
for
setting
a
newborn
child
in
a
and
surrounding
it
with
corn
was
probably
the
wish
to
communicate
to
the
infant
on
the
principle
of
sympathetic
magic
the
fertility
and
especially
the
power
of
growth
possessed
by
the
grain
this
was
in
substance
the
explanation
which
mannhardt
gave
of
the
custom
he
rightly
insisted
on
the
analogy
which
many
peoples
and
in
particular
the
ancient
greeks
have
traced
between
the
sowing
of
seed
and
the
begetting
of
children
and
he
confirmed
his
view
of
the
function
of
the
in
these
ceremonies
by
aptly
comparing
a
german
custom
of
sowing
barley
or
flax
seed
over
weakly
and
stunted
children
in
the
belief
that
this
will
make
them
grow
with
the
growth
of
the
barley
or
the
flax
an
esthonian
mode
of
accomplishing
the
same
object
is
to
set
the
child
in
the
middle
of
a
plot
of
ground
where
a
sower
is
sowing
hemp
and
to
leave
the
little
one
there
till
the
sowing
is
finished
after
that
they
imagine
that
the
child
will
shoot
up
in
stature
like
the
hemp
which
has
just
been
sown
with
the
foregoing
evidence
before
us
of
a
widespread
custom
of
placing
newborn
children
in
we
clearly
can
not
argue
that
dionysus
must
necessarily
have
been
a
god
of
the
corn
because
greek
tradition
and
greek
art
represent
him
as
an
infant
cradled
in
a
the
argument
would
prove
too
much
for
it
would
apply
equally
to
all
the
infants
that
have
been
so
cradled
in
all
parts
of
the
world
we
can
not
even
press
the
argument
drawn
from
the
surname
he
of
the
which
was
borne
by
dionysus
since
we
have
seen
that
similar
names
are
borne
for
similar
reasons
in
india
by
persons
who
have
no
claim
whatever
to
be
regarded
as
deities
of
the
corn
yet
when
all
necessary
deductions
have
been
made
on
this
score
the
association
of
dionysus
with
the
appears
to
be
too
intimate
to
be
explained
away
as
a
mere
reminiscence
of
a
practice
to
which
every
greek
baby
whether
human
or
divine
had
to
submit
that
practice
would
hardly
account
either
for
the
use
of
the
in
the
mysteries
or
for
the
appearance
of
the
implement
filled
with
fruitage
of
various
kinds
on
the
monuments
which
set
forth
the
ritual
of
dionysus
this
last
emblem
points
plainly
to
a
conception
of
the
god
as
a
personification
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
in
general
and
as
if
to
emphasise
the
idea
of
fecundity
conveyed
by
such
a
symbol
there
sometimes
appears
among
the
fruits
in
the
an
effigy
of
the
male
organ
of
generation
the
prominent
place
which
that
effigy
occupied
in
the
worship
of
dionysus
hints
broadly
if
it
does
not
strictly
prove
that
to
the
greek
mind
the
god
stood
for
the
powers
of
fertility
in
general
animal
as
well
as
vegetable
in
the
thought
of
the
ancients
no
sharp
line
of
distinction
divided
the
fertility
of
animals
from
the
fertility
of
plants
rather
the
two
ideas
met
and
blended
in
a
nebulous
haze
we
need
not
wonder
therefore
that
the
same
coarse
but
expressive
emblem
figured
conspicuously
in
the
ritual
of
father
liber
the
italian
counterpart
of
dionysus
who
in
return
for
the
homage
paid
to
the
symbol
of
his
creative
energy
was
believed
to
foster
the
growth
of
the
crops
and
to
guard
the
fields
against
the
powers
of
evil
like
the
other
gods
of
vegetation
whom
we
considered
in
the
last
volume
dionysus
was
believed
to
have
died
a
violent
death
but
to
have
been
brought
to
life
again
and
his
sufferings
death
and
resurrection
were
enacted
in
his
sacred
rites
his
tragic
story
is
thus
told
by
the
poet
nonnus
zeus
in
the
form
of
a
serpent
visited
persephone
and
she
bore
him
zagreus
that
is
dionysus
a
horned
infant
scarcely
was
he
born
when
the
babe
mounted
the
throne
of
his
father
zeus
and
mimicked
the
great
god
by
brandishing
the
lightning
in
his
tiny
hand
but
he
did
not
occupy
the
throne
long
for
the
treacherous
titans
their
faces
whitened
with
chalk
attacked
him
with
knives
while
he
was
looking
at
himself
in
a
mirror
for
a
time
he
evaded
their
assaults
by
turning
himself
into
various
shapes
assuming
the
likeness
successively
of
zeus
and
cronus
of
a
young
man
of
a
lion
a
horse
and
a
serpent
finally
in
the
form
of
a
bull
he
was
cut
to
pieces
by
the
murderous
knives
of
his
enemies
his
cretan
myth
as
related
by
firmicus
maternus
ran
thus
he
was
said
to
have
been
the
bastard
son
of
jupiter
a
cretan
king
going
abroad
jupiter
transferred
the
throne
and
sceptre
to
the
youthful
dionysus
but
knowing
that
his
wife
juno
cherished
a
jealous
dislike
of
the
child
he
entrusted
dionysus
to
the
care
of
guards
upon
whose
fidelity
he
believed
he
could
rely
juno
however
bribed
the
guards
and
amusing
the
child
with
rattles
and
a
lured
him
into
an
ambush
where
her
satellites
the
titans
rushed
upon
him
cut
him
limb
from
limb
boiled
his
body
with
various
herbs
and
ate
it
but
his
sister
minerva
who
had
shared
in
the
deed
kept
his
heart
and
gave
it
to
jupiter
on
his
return
revealing
to
him
the
whole
history
of
the
crime
in
his
rage
jupiter
put
the
titans
to
death
by
torture
and
to
soothe
his
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
son
made
an
image
in
which
he
enclosed
the
child
s
heart
and
then
built
a
temple
in
his
honour
in
this
version
a
euhemeristic
turn
has
been
given
to
the
myth
by
representing
jupiter
and
juno
zeus
and
hera
as
a
king
and
queen
of
crete
the
guards
referred
to
are
the
mythical
curetes
who
danced
a
round
the
infant
dionysus
as
they
are
said
to
have
done
round
the
infant
zeus
very
noteworthy
is
the
legend
recorded
both
by
nonnus
and
firmicus
that
in
his
infancy
dionysus
occupied
for
a
short
time
the
throne
of
his
father
zeus
so
proclus
tells
us
that
dionysus
was
the
last
king
of
the
gods
appointed
by
zeus
for
his
father
set
him
on
the
kingly
throne
and
placed
in
his
hand
the
sceptre
and
made
him
king
of
all
the
gods
of
the
such
traditions
point
to
a
custom
of
temporarily
investing
the
king
s
son
with
the
royal
dignity
as
a
preliminary
to
sacrificing
him
instead
of
his
father
pomegranates
were
supposed
to
have
sprung
from
the
blood
of
dionysus
as
anemones
from
the
blood
of
adonis
and
violets
from
the
blood
of
attis
hence
women
refrained
from
eating
seeds
of
pomegranates
at
the
festival
of
the
thesmophoria
according
to
some
the
severed
limbs
of
dionysus
were
pieced
together
at
the
command
of
zeus
by
apollo
who
buried
them
on
parnassus
the
grave
of
dionysus
was
shewn
in
the
delphic
temple
beside
a
golden
statue
of
apollo
however
according
to
another
account
the
grave
of
dionysus
was
at
thebes
where
he
is
said
to
have
been
torn
in
pieces
thus
far
the
resurrection
of
the
slain
god
is
not
mentioned
but
in
other
versions
of
the
myth
it
is
variously
related
according
to
one
version
which
represented
dionysus
as
a
son
of
zeus
and
demeter
his
mother
pieced
together
his
mangled
limbs
and
made
him
young
again
in
others
it
is
simply
said
that
shortly
after
his
burial
he
rose
from
the
dead
and
ascended
up
to
heaven
or
that
zeus
raised
him
up
as
he
lay
mortally
wounded
or
that
zeus
swallowed
the
heart
of
dionysus
and
then
begat
him
afresh
by
semele
who
in
the
common
legend
figures
as
mother
of
dionysus
or
again
the
heart
was
pounded
up
and
given
in
a
portion
to
semele
who
thereby
conceived
him
turning
from
the
myth
to
the
ritual
we
find
that
the
cretans
celebrated
a
biennial
festival
at
which
the
passion
of
dionysus
was
represented
in
every
detail
all
that
he
had
done
or
suffered
in
his
last
moments
was
enacted
before
the
eyes
of
his
worshippers
who
tore
a
live
bull
to
pieces
with
their
teeth
and
roamed
the
woods
with
frantic
shouts
in
front
of
them
was
carried
a
casket
supposed
to
contain
the
sacred
heart
of
dionysus
and
to
the
wild
music
of
flutes
and
cymbals
they
mimicked
the
rattles
by
which
the
infant
god
had
been
lured
to
his
doom
where
the
resurrection
formed
part
of
the
myth
it
also
was
acted
at
the
rites
and
it
even
appears
that
a
general
doctrine
of
resurrection
or
at
least
of
immortality
was
inculcated
on
the
worshippers
for
plutarch
writing
to
console
his
wife
on
the
death
of
their
infant
daughter
comforts
her
with
the
thought
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
taught
by
tradition
and
revealed
in
the
mysteries
of
dionysus
a
different
form
of
the
myth
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
dionysus
is
that
he
descended
into
hades
to
bring
up
his
mother
semele
from
the
dead
the
local
argive
tradition
was
that
he
went
down
through
the
alcyonian
lake
and
his
return
from
the
lower
world
in
other
words
his
resurrection
was
annually
celebrated
on
the
spot
by
the
argives
who
summoned
him
from
the
water
by
trumpet
blasts
while
they
threw
a
lamb
into
the
lake
as
an
offering
to
the
warder
of
the
dead
whether
this
was
a
spring
festival
does
not
appear
but
the
lydians
certainly
celebrated
the
advent
of
dionysus
in
spring
the
god
was
supposed
to
bring
the
season
with
him
deities
of
vegetation
who
are
supposed
to
pass
a
certain
portion
of
each
year
under
ground
naturally
come
to
be
regarded
as
gods
of
the
lower
world
or
of
the
dead
both
dionysus
and
osiris
were
so
conceived
a
feature
in
the
mythical
character
of
dionysus
which
at
first
sight
appears
inconsistent
with
his
nature
as
a
deity
of
vegetation
is
that
he
was
often
conceived
and
represented
in
animal
shape
especially
in
the
form
or
at
least
with
the
horns
of
a
bull
thus
he
is
spoken
of
as
bull
he
was
believed
to
appear
at
least
occasionally
as
a
bull
his
images
were
often
as
at
cyzicus
made
in
bull
shape
or
with
bull
horns
and
he
was
painted
with
horns
types
of
the
horned
dionysus
are
found
amongst
the
surviving
monuments
of
antiquity
on
one
statuette
he
appears
clad
in
a
bull
s
hide
the
head
horns
and
hoofs
hanging
down
behind
again
he
is
represented
as
a
child
with
clusters
of
grapes
round
his
brow
and
a
calf
s
head
with
sprouting
horns
attached
to
the
back
of
his
head
on
a
vase
the
god
is
portrayed
as
a
child
seated
on
a
woman
s
lap
the
people
of
cynaetha
in
arcadia
held
a
festival
of
dionysus
in
winter
when
men
who
had
greased
their
bodies
with
oil
for
the
occasion
used
to
pick
out
a
bull
from
the
herd
and
carry
it
to
the
sanctuary
of
the
god
dionysus
was
supposed
to
inspire
their
choice
of
the
particular
bull
which
probably
represented
the
deity
himself
for
at
his
festivals
he
was
believed
to
appear
in
bull
form
the
women
of
elis
hailed
him
as
a
bull
and
prayed
him
to
come
with
his
bull
s
foot
they
sang
come
hither
dionysus
to
thy
holy
temple
by
the
sea
come
with
the
graces
to
thy
temple
rushing
with
thy
bull
s
foot
o
goodly
bull
o
goodly
bull
the
bacchanals
of
thrace
wore
horns
in
imitation
of
their
god
according
to
the
myth
it
was
in
the
shape
of
a
bull
that
he
was
torn
to
pieces
by
the
titans
and
the
cretans
when
they
acted
the
sufferings
and
death
of
dionysus
tore
a
live
bull
to
pieces
with
their
teeth
indeed
the
rending
and
devouring
of
live
bulls
and
calves
appear
to
have
been
a
regular
feature
of
the
dionysiac
rites
when
we
consider
the
practice
of
portraying
the
god
as
a
bull
or
with
some
of
the
features
of
the
animal
the
belief
that
he
appeared
in
bull
form
to
his
worshippers
at
the
sacred
rites
and
the
legend
that
in
bull
form
he
had
been
torn
in
pieces
we
can
not
doubt
that
in
rending
and
devouring
a
live
bull
at
his
festival
the
worshippers
of
dionysus
believed
themselves
to
be
killing
the
god
eating
his
flesh
and
drinking
his
blood
another
animal
whose
form
dionysus
assumed
was
the
goat
one
of
his
names
was
at
athens
and
at
hermion
he
was
worshipped
under
the
title
of
the
one
of
the
black
goatskin
and
a
legend
ran
that
on
a
certain
occasion
he
had
appeared
clad
in
the
skin
from
which
he
took
the
title
in
the
district
of
phlius
where
in
autumn
the
plain
is
still
thickly
mantled
with
the
red
and
golden
foliage
of
the
fading
vines
there
stood
of
old
a
bronze
image
of
a
goat
which
the
husbandmen
plastered
with
as
a
means
of
protecting
their
vines
against
blight
the
image
probably
represented
the
himself
to
save
him
from
the
wrath
of
hera
his
father
zeus
changed
the
youthful
dionysus
into
a
kid
and
when
the
gods
fled
to
egypt
to
escape
the
fury
of
typhon
dionysus
was
turned
into
a
goat
hence
when
his
worshippers
rent
in
pieces
a
live
goat
and
devoured
it
raw
they
must
have
believed
that
they
were
eating
the
body
and
blood
of
the
god
the
custom
of
tearing
in
pieces
the
bodies
of
animals
and
of
men
and
then
devouring
them
raw
has
been
practised
as
a
religious
rite
by
savages
in
modern
times
we
need
not
therefore
dismiss
as
a
fable
the
testimony
of
antiquity
to
the
observance
of
similar
rites
among
the
frenzied
worshippers
of
bacchus
an
english
missionary
to
the
coast
indians
of
british
columbia
has
thus
described
a
scene
like
the
cannibal
orgies
of
the
bacchanals
after
mentioning
that
an
old
chief
had
ordered
a
female
slave
to
be
dragged
to
the
beach
murdered
and
thrown
into
the
water
he
proceeds
as
follows
i
did
not
see
the
murder
but
immediately
after
i
saw
crowds
of
people
running
out
of
those
houses
near
to
where
the
corpse
was
thrown
and
forming
themselves
into
groups
at
a
good
distance
away
this
i
learnt
was
from
fear
of
what
was
to
follow
presently
two
bands
of
furious
wretches
appeared
each
headed
by
a
man
in
a
state
of
nudity
they
gave
vent
to
the
most
unearthly
sounds
and
the
two
naked
men
made
themselves
look
as
unearthly
as
possible
proceeding
in
a
creeping
kind
of
stoop
and
stepping
like
two
proud
horses
at
the
same
time
shooting
forward
each
arm
alternately
which
they
held
out
at
full
length
for
a
little
time
in
the
most
defiant
manner
besides
this
the
continual
jerking
their
heads
back
causing
their
long
black
hair
to
twist
about
added
much
to
their
savage
appearance
for
some
time
they
pretended
to
be
seeking
the
body
and
the
instant
they
came
where
it
lay
they
commenced
screaming
and
rushing
round
it
like
so
many
angry
wolves
finally
they
seized
it
dragged
it
out
of
the
water
and
laid
it
on
the
beach
where
i
was
told
the
naked
men
would
commence
tearing
it
to
pieces
with
their
teeth
the
two
bands
of
men
immediately
surrounded
them
and
so
hid
their
horrid
work
in
a
few
minutes
the
crowd
broke
into
two
when
each
of
the
naked
cannibals
appeared
with
half
of
the
body
in
his
hands
separating
a
few
yards
they
commenced
amid
horrid
yells
their
still
more
horrid
feast
the
sight
was
too
terrible
to
behold
i
left
the
gallery
with
a
depressed
heart
i
may
mention
that
the
two
bands
of
savages
just
alluded
to
belong
to
that
class
which
the
whites
term
the
same
writer
informs
us
that
at
the
winter
ceremonials
of
these
indians
the
cannibal
on
such
occasions
is
generally
supplied
with
two
three
or
four
human
bodies
which
he
tears
to
pieces
before
his
audience
several
persons
either
from
bravado
or
as
a
charm
present
their
arms
for
him
to
bite
i
have
seen
several
whom
he
has
bitten
and
i
hear
two
have
died
from
the
and
when
corpses
were
not
forthcoming
these
cannibals
apparently
seized
and
devoured
living
people
duncan
has
seen
hundreds
of
the
tsimshian
indians
sitting
in
their
canoes
which
they
had
just
pushed
off
from
the
shore
in
order
to
escape
being
torn
to
pieces
by
a
party
of
prowling
cannibals
others
of
these
indians
contented
themselves
with
tearing
dogs
to
pieces
while
their
attendants
kept
up
a
growling
noise
or
a
whoop
which
was
seconded
by
a
screeching
noise
made
from
an
instrument
which
they
believe
to
be
the
abode
of
a
duncan
s
account
of
these
savage
rites
has
been
fully
borne
out
by
later
observation
among
the
kwakiutl
indians
the
cannibals
are
the
highest
in
rank
of
the
secret
societies
they
devour
corpses
bite
pieces
out
of
living
people
and
formerly
ate
slaves
who
had
been
killed
for
the
purpose
but
when
their
fury
has
subsided
they
are
obliged
to
pay
compensation
to
the
persons
whom
they
have
bitten
and
to
the
owners
of
slaves
whom
they
have
killed
the
indemnity
consists
sometimes
of
blankets
sometimes
of
canoes
in
the
latter
case
the
tariff
is
fixed
one
bite
one
canoe
for
some
time
after
eating
human
flesh
the
cannibal
has
to
observe
a
great
many
rules
which
regulate
his
eating
and
drinking
his
going
out
and
his
coming
in
his
clothing
and
his
intercourse
with
his
wife
similar
customs
prevail
among
other
tribes
of
the
same
coast
such
as
the
bella
coola
the
tsimshian
the
niska
and
the
nootka
in
the
nootka
tribe
members
of
the
panther
society
tear
dogs
to
pieces
and
devour
them
they
wear
masks
armed
with
canine
teeth
so
among
the
haida
indians
of
the
queen
charlotte
islands
there
is
one
religion
of
cannibalism
and
another
of
the
cannibals
in
a
state
of
frenzy
real
or
pretended
bite
flesh
out
of
the
extended
arms
of
their
fellow
villagers
when
they
issue
forth
with
cries
of
to
observe
this
solemn
rite
all
who
are
of
a
different
religious
persuasion
make
haste
to
get
out
of
their
way
but
men
of
the
cannibal
creed
and
of
stout
hearts
will
resolutely
hold
out
their
arms
to
be
bitten
the
sect
of
cut
or
tear
dogs
to
pieces
and
devour
some
of
the
flesh
but
they
have
to
pay
for
the
dogs
which
they
consume
in
their
religious
enthusiasm
in
the
performance
of
these
savage
rites
the
frenzied
actors
are
believed
to
be
inspired
by
a
cannibal
spirit
and
a
spirit

there
is
an
order
of
saints
known
as

of

whose

they
assemble
at

elsewhere
and
holding
each

dance
a
frantic
dance
round
a
fire
while
the
mad
dance
is
still
proceeding
a
sudden
rush
is
made
from

sanctuary
and
the
dancers
like

delirious
speed
away
to
a
place
where
live

in
readiness
at

of

and

wretched

now
at

the
people
avoid
them
as

as

goats

try
to
prevent
the
desecration
of

but
the
fanatics
sometimes
prevail
and
the
unclean
animal
abhorred
by
the
mussulman
is
torn
in
pieces
and
devoured
or
pretended
to
be
devoured
with
indiscriminating
the
custom
of
killing
a
god
in
animal
form
which
we
shall
examine
more
in
detail
further
on
belongs
to
a
very
early
stage
of
human
culture
and
is
apt
in
later
times
to
be
misunderstood
the
advance
of
thought
tends
to
strip
the
old
animal
and
plant
gods
of
their
bestial
and
vegetable
husk
and
to
leave
their
human
attributes
which
are
always
the
kernel
of
the
conception
as
the
final
and
sole
residuum
in
other
words
animal
and
plant
gods
tend
to
become
purely
anthropomorphic
when
they
have
become
wholly
or
nearly
so
the
animals
and
plants
which
were
at
first
the
deities
themselves
still
retain
a
vague
and
connexion
with
the
anthropomorphic
gods
who
have
been
developed
out
of
them
the
origin
of
the
relationship
between
the
deity
and
the
animal
or
plant
having
been
forgotten
various
stories
are
invented
to
explain
it
these
explanations
may
follow
one
of
two
lines
according
as
they
are
based
on
the
habitual
or
on
the
exceptional
treatment
of
the
sacred
animal
or
plant
the
sacred
animal
was
habitually
spared
and
only
exceptionally
slain
and
accordingly
the
myth
might
be
devised
to
explain
either
why
it
was
spared
or
why
it
was
killed
devised
for
the
former
purpose
the
myth
would
tell
of
some
service
rendered
to
the
deity
by
the
animal
devised
for
the
latter
purpose
the
myth
would
tell
of
some
injury
inflicted
by
the
animal
on
the
god
the
reason
given
for
sacrificing
goats
to
dionysus
exemplifies
a
myth
of
the
latter
sort
they
were
sacrificed
to
him
it
was
said
because
they
injured
the
vine
now
the
goat
as
we
have
seen
was
originally
an
embodiment
of
the
god
himself
but
when
the
god
had
divested
himself
of
his
animal
character
and
had
become
essentially
anthropomorphic
the
killing
of
the
goat
in
his
worship
came
to
be
regarded
no
longer
as
a
slaying
of
the
deity
himself
but
as
a
sacrifice
offered
to
him
and
since
some
reason
had
to
be
assigned
why
the
goat
in
particular
should
be
sacrificed
it
was
alleged
that
this
was
a
punishment
inflicted
on
the
goat
for
injuring
the
vine
the
object
of
the
god
s
especial
care
thus
we
have
the
strange
spectacle
of
a
god
sacrificed
to
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
is
his
own
enemy
and
as
the
deity
is
supposed
to
partake
of
the
victim
offered
to
him
it
follows
that
when
the
victim
is
the
god
s
old
self
the
god
eats
of
his
own
flesh
hence
the
dionysus
is
represented
as
eating
raw
goat
s
blood
and
the
dionysus
is
called
eater
of
on
the
analogy
of
these
instances
we
may
conjecture
that
wherever
a
deity
is
described
as
the
eater
of
a
particular
animal
the
animal
in
question
was
originally
nothing
but
the
deity
himself
later
on
we
shall
find
that
some
savages
propitiate
dead
bears
and
whales
by
offering
them
portions
of
their
own
bodies
all
this
however
does
not
explain
why
a
deity
of
vegetation
should
appear
in
animal
form
but
the
consideration
of
that
point
had
better
be
deferred
till
we
have
discussed
the
character
and
attributes
of
demeter
meantime
it
remains
to
mention
that
in
some
places
instead
of
an
animal
a
human
being
was
torn
in
pieces
at
the
rites
of
dionysus
this
was
the
practice
in
chios
and
tenedos
and
at
potniae
in
boeotia
the
tradition
ran
that
it
had
been
formerly
the
custom
to
sacrifice
to
the
dionysus
a
child
for
whom
a
goat
was
afterwards
substituted
at
orchomenus
as
we
have
seen
the
human
victim
was
taken
from
the
women
of
an
old
royal
family
as
the
slain
bull
or
goat
represented
the
slain
god
so
we
may
suppose
the
human
victim
also
represented
him
the
legends
of
the
deaths
of
pentheus
and
lycurgus
two
kings
who
are
said
to
have
been
torn
to
pieces
the
one
by
bacchanals
the
other
by
horses
for
their
opposition
to
the
rites
of
dionysus
may
be
as
i
have
already
suggested
distorted
reminiscences
of
a
custom
of
sacrificing
divine
kings
in
the
character
of
dionysus
and
of
dispersing
the
fragments
of
their
broken
bodies
over
the
fields
for
the
purpose
of
fertilising
them
in
regard
to
lycurgus
king
of
the
thracian
tribe
of
the
edonians
it
is
expressly
said
that
his
subjects
at
the
bidding
of
an
oracle
caused
him
to
be
rent
in
pieces
by
horses
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
the
fertility
of
the
ground
after
a
period
of
barrenness
and
dearth
there
is
no
improbability
in
the
tradition
we
have
seen
that
in
africa
and
other
parts
of
the
world
kings
or
chiefs
have
often
been
put
to
death
by
their
people
for
similar
reasons
further
it
is
significant
that
king
lycurgus
is
said
to
have
slain
his
own
son
dryas
with
an
axe
in
a
fit
of
madness
mistaking
him
for
a
have
we
not
in
this
tradition
a
reminiscence
of
a
custom
of
sacrificing
the
king
s
son
in
place
of
the
father
similarly
athamas
a
king
of
thessaly
or
boeotia
is
said
to
have
been
doomed
by
an
oracle
to
be
sacrificed
at
the
altar
in
order
to
remove
the
curse
of
barrenness
which
afflicted
his
country
however
he
contrived
to
evade
the
sentence
and
in
a
fit
of
madness
killed
his
own
son
learchus
mistaking
him
for
a
wild
beast
that
this
legend
was
not
a
mere
myth
is
made
probable
by
a
custom
observed
at
alus
down
to
historical
times
the
eldest
male
scion
of
the
royal
house
was
regularly
sacrificed
in
due
form
to
laphystian
zeus
if
he
ever
set
foot
within
the
the
close
resemblance
between
the
legends
of
king
athamas
and
king
lycurgus
furnishes
a
ground
for
believing
both
legends
to
be
based
on
a
real
custom
of
sacrificing
either
the
king
himself
or
one
of
his
sons
for
the
good
of
the
country
and
the
story
that
the
king
s
son
dryas
perished
because
his
frenzied
father
mistook
him
for
a
fits
in
well
with
the
theory
that
the
victim
in
these
sacrifices
represented
the
dionysus
it
is
probably
no
mere
coincidence
that
dionysus
himself
is
said
to
have
been
torn
in
pieces
at
thebes
the
very
place
where
according
to
legend
the
same
fate
befell
king
pentheus
at
the
hands
of
the
frenzied
votaries
of
the
the
theory
that
in
prehistoric
times
greek
and
thracian
kings
or
their
sons
may
have
been
dismembered
in
the
character
of
the
or
the
for
the
purpose
of
fertilising
the
earth
or
quickening
the
vines
has
received
of
late
years
some
confirmation
from
the
discovery
that
down
to
the
present
time
in
thrace
the
original
home
of
dionysus
a
drama
is
still
annually
performed
which
reproduces
with
remarkable
fidelity
some
of
the
most
striking
traits
in
the
dionysiac
myth
and
ritual
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
i
have
already
called
attention
to
this
interesting
survival
of
paganism
among
a
christian
peasantry
but
it
seems
desirable
and
appropriate
in
this
place
to
draw
out
somewhat
more
fully
the
parallelism
between
the
modern
drama
and
the
ancient
worship
the
drama
which
may
reasonably
be
regarded
as
a
direct
descendant
of
the
dionysiac
rites
is
annually
performed
at
the
carnival
in
all
the
christian
villages
which
cluster
round
viza
the
ancient
bizya
a
town
of
thrace
situated
about
midway
between
adrianople
and
constantinople
in
antiquity
the
city
was
the
capital
of
the
thracian
tribe
of
the
asti
the
kings
had
their
palace
there
probably
in
the
acropolis
of
which
some
fine
walls
are
still
standing
inscriptions
preserved
in
the
modern
town
record
the
names
of
some
of
these
old
kings
the
date
of
the
celebration
is
cheese
monday
as
it
is
locally
called
which
is
the
monday
of
the
last
week
of
carnival
at
viza
itself
the
mummery
has
been
shorn
of
some
of
its
ancient
features
but
these
have
been
kept
up
at
the
villages
and
have
been
particularly
observed
and
recorded
at
the
village
of
george
haghios
gheorgios
it
is
to
the
drama
as
acted
at
that
village
that
the
following
description
specially
applies
the
principal
parts
in
the
drama
are
taken
by
two
men
disguised
in
goatskins
each
of
them
wears
a
headdress
made
of
a
complete
goatskin
which
is
stuffed
so
as
to
rise
a
foot
or
more
like
a
shako
over
his
head
while
the
skin
falls
over
the
face
forming
a
mask
with
holes
cut
for
the

their
shoulders
are
thickly
padded
with
hay
to
protect
them
from

be
rained

liberally

their
backs
fawnskins
on
their
shoulders
and
goatskins
on
their
legs
are
or
used
to
be
part
of
their
equipment

another
indispensable
part
of
it
is
a
number
of
tied
round
their
waists

of
the
two
actors
carries
a
bow
and
the
other
a
wooden
effigy
of
the
male
organ
of

both
these
actors
must
be
married
men
according
to
vizyenos
they
are
chosen
for
periods
of
four
years
two

sometimes
called

a
man
disguised
as
an

basket
the
brat
is
supposed
to
be
a
child
born
out
of

begotten
by
an
unknown
father

in
which
the

such
are
the
masqueraders
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
they
perform
their

spent
by
them
going
from
door
to
door
collecting
bread
eggs
or
money
at
every
door
the
two
maskers
knock
the
boys
disguised
as

enact
an
obscene
pantomime
on

when
every
house
in

village
has
been
thus
visited
the
troop
takes
up
position
on
the
open
space
before
the
village
church
where
the
whole
population
has
already
mustered
to
witness
the
performance
after
a
dance

in
which
all
the
actors
take
part
the
two
maskers
withdraw
and
leave
the
field
to

now
pretend
to
forge

to
work

bellows
at
this
point
the
old
woman

baby
is
supposed
to
grow
up
at
a
great
pace
to
develop
a
huge
appetite
for
meat
and
drink
and
to
clamour
for
a
wife
one
of
the
men
now
pursues
one
of
the
two
pretended
brides
and
a
mock
marriage
is
celebrated
between
the
couple
after
these
nuptials
have
been
performed
with
a
parody
of
a
real
wedding
the
mock
bridegroom
is
shot
by
his
comrade
with
the
bow
and
falls
down
on
his
face
like
dead
his
slayer
thereupon
feigns
to
skin
him
with
a
knife
but
the
dead
man

wife
laments
over
her
deceased
husband
with
loud
cries
throwing
herself
across
his
prostrate
body
in
this
lamentation
the
slayer
himself
and
all
the
other
actors

burlesqued
and
the
pretended
corpse
is
lifted
up
as
if
to
be
carried
to
the
grave
at
this
point
however
the
dead
man
disconcerts
the
preparations
for
his
burial
by
suddenly
coming
to
life
again
and
getting
up
so
ends
the
drama
of
death
and
resurrection
the
next
act
opens
with
a
repetition
of
the
pretence
of
forging
a
ploughshare
but
this
time
the
gypsy
man
hammers
on
a
real
share
when
the
implement
is
supposed
to
have
been
fashioned
a
real
plough
is
brought
forward
the
mockery
appears
to
cease
the
two
boys
dressed
as
girls
are
yoked
to
the
plough
and
drag
it
twice
round
the
village
square
contrary
to
the
way
of
the
sun
one
of
the
two
men
walks
at
the
tail
of
the
plough
the
other
guides
it
in
front
and
a
third
man
follows
in
the
rear
scattering
seed
from
a
basket
after
the
two
rounds
have
been
completed
the
gypsy
and
his
wife
are
yoked
to
the
plough
and
drag
it
a
third
time
round
the
square
the
two
men
still
playing
the
part
of
ploughmen
at
viza
the
plough
is
drawn
by
the
men
themselves
while
the
plough
is
going
its
rounds
followed
by
the
sower
sowing
the
seed
the
people
pray
aloud
saying

amen
o

filled
this
ends
the
performance
the
evening
is
spent
in
feasting
on
the
proceeds
of
the
visitation
which
took
place
in
the
morning
a
kindred
festival
is
observed
on
the
same
day
of
the
carnival
at
kosti
a
place
in
the
extreme
north
of
thrace
near
the
black
sea
there
a
man
dressed
in
sheepskins
or
goatskins
with
a
mask
on
his
face
bells
round
his
neck
and
a
broom
in
his
hand
goes
round
the
village
collecting
food
and
presents
he
is
addressed
as
a
king
and
escorted
with
music
with
him
go
boys
dressed
as
girls
and
another
boy
not
so
disguised
who
carries
wine
in
a
wooden
bottle
and
gives
of
it
to
every
householder
to
drink
in
a
cup
receiving
a
gift
in
return
the
king
then
mounts
a
cart
and
is
drawn
to
the
church
he
carries
seed
in
his
hand
and
at
the
church
two
bands
of
men
one
of
married
men
and
the
other
of
unmarried
men
try
each
in
turn
to
induce
the
king
to
throw
the
seed
on
them
finally
he
casts
it
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
church
the
ceremony
ends
with
stripping
the
king
of
his
clothes
and
flinging
him
into
the
river
after
which
he
resumes
his
usual
dress
in
these
ceremonies
still
annually
held
at
and
near
an
old
capital
of
thracian
kings
the
points
of
similarity
to
the
ritual
of
the
ancient
thracian
deity
dionysus
are
sufficiently
obvious
the
goatskins
in
which
the
principal
actors
are
disguised
remind
us
of
the
identification
of
dionysus
with
a
goat
the
infant
cradled
in
a
and
taking
its
name
from
the
implement
answers
exactly
to
the
traditions
and
the
monuments
which
represent
the
infant
dionysus
as
similarly
cradled
and
similarly
named
the
pretence
that
the
baby
is
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
and
begotten
by
an
unknown
father
tallies
precisely
with
the
legend
that
dionysus
was
born
prematurely
in
the
seventh
month
as
the
offspring
of
an
intrigue
between
a
mortal
woman
and
a
mysterious
divine
father
the
same
coarse
symbol
of
reproductive
energy
which
characterised
the
ancient
ritual
of
dionysus
figures
conspicuously
in
the
modern
drama
the
annual
mock
marriage
of
the
mummer
with
the
pretended
bride
may
be
compared
with
the
annual
pretence
of
marrying
dionysus
to
the
queen
of
athens
and
the
simulated
slaughter
and
resurrection
of
the
same
actor
may
be
compared
with
the
traditional
slaughter
and
resurrection
of
the
god
himself
further
the
ceremony
of
ploughing
in
which
after
his
resurrection
the
mummer
takes
a
prominent
part
fits
in
well
not
only
with
the
legend
that
dionysus
was
the
first
to
yoke
oxen
to
the
plough
but
also
with
the
symbolism
of
the
in
his
worship
while
the
prayers
for
plentiful
crops
which
accompany
the
ploughing
accord
with
the
omens
of
an
abundant
harvest
which
were
drawn
of
old
from
the
mystic
light
seen
to
illumine
by
night
one
of
his
ancient
sanctuaries
in
thrace
lastly
in
the
ceremony
as
observed
at
kosti
the
giving
of
wine
by
the
king
s
attendant
is
an
act
worthy
of
the
the
throwing
of
seed
by
the
king
can
only
be
interpreted
like
the
ploughing
as
a
charm
to
promote
the
fertility
of
the
ground
and
the
royal
title
borne
by
the
principal
masker
harmonises
well
with
the
theory
that
the
part
of
the
god
of
the
corn
and
the
wine
was
of
old
sustained
by
the
thracian
kings
who
reigned
at
bisya
if
we
ask
to
what
ancient
festival
of
dionysus
does
the
modern
celebration
of
the
carnival
in
thrace
most
nearly
correspond
the
answer
can
be
hardly
doubtful
the
thracian
drama
of
the
mock
marriage
of
the
mummer
his
mimic
death
and
resurrection
and
his
subsequent
ploughing
corresponds
both
in
date
and
in
character
most
nearly
to
the
athenian
festival
of
the
anthesteria
which
was
celebrated
at
athens
during
three
days
in
early
spring
towards
the
end
of
february
or
the
beginning
of
march
thus
the
date
of
the
anthesteria
could
not
fall
far
from
and
it
might
sometimes
actually
coincide
with
the
last
week
of
the
carnival
the
date
of
the
thracian
celebration
while
the
details
of
the
festival
of
the
anthesteria
are
obscure
its
general
character
is
well
known
it
was
a
festival
both
of
and
of
the
dead
whose
souls
were
supposed
to
revisit
the
city
and
to
go
about
the
streets
just
as
in
modern
europe
and
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
the
ghosts
of
the
departed
are
still
believed
to
return
to
their
old
homes
on
one
day
of
the
year
and
to
be
entertained
by
their
relatives
at
a
solemn
feast
of
all
souls
but
the
dionysiac
nature
of
the
festival
was
revealed
not
merely
by
the
opening
of
the
and
the
wassailing
which
went
on
throughout
the
city
among
freemen
and
slaves
alike
on
the
second
day
of
the
festival
the
marriage
of
dionysus
with
the
queen
of
athens
was
celebrated
with
great
solemnity
at
the
bucolium
or
it
has
been
suggested
with
much
probability
that
at
this
sacred
marriage
in
the
the
god
was
represented
wholly
or
partly
in
bovine
shape
whether
by
an
image
or
by
an
actor
dressed
in
the
hide
and
wearing
the
horns
of
a
bull
for
as
we
have
seen
dionysus
was
often
supposed
to
assume
the
form
of
a
bull
and
to
present
himself
in
that
guise
to
his
worshippers
if
this
conjecture
should
prove
to
be
a
demonstration
of
it
can
hardly
be
sacred
marriage
of
the
queen
to
the
at
athens
would
be
parallel
to
the
sacred
marriage
of
the
queen
to
the
at
cnossus
according
to
the
interpretation
which
i
have
suggested
of
the
myth
of
pasiphae
and
the
minotaur
only
whereas
the
at
cnossus
if
i
am
right
stood
for
the
sun
the
at
athens
stood
for
the
powers
of
vegetation
especially
the
corn
and
the
vines
it
would
not
be
surprising
that
among
a
people
in
early
days
the
bull
regarded
as
a
type
of
strength
and
reproductive
energy
should
be
employed
to
symbolise
and
represent
more
than
one
of
the
great
powers
of
nature
if
dionysus
did
indeed
figure
as
a
bull
at
his
marriage
it
is
not
improbable
that
on
that
occasion
his
representative
whether
a
real
bull
or
a
man
dressed
in
a
bull
s
hide
took
part
in
a
ceremony
of
ploughing
for
we
have
seen
that
the
invention
of
yoking
oxen
to
the
plough
was
ascribed
to
dionysus
and
we
know
that
the
athenians
performed
a
sacred
ceremony
of
ploughing
which
went
by
the
name
of
the
ploughing
and
took
place
in
a
field
or
other
open
piece
of
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
acropolis
it
is
a
reasonable
conjecture
that
the
field
of
the
ploughing
may
have
adjoined
the
building
called
the
in
which
the
marriage
of
dionysus
with
the
queen
was
solemnised
for
that
building
is
known
to
have
been
near
the
prytaneum
or
on
the
northern
slope
of
the
acropolis
thus
on
the
whole
the
ancient
festival
of
the
anthesteria
so
far
as
its
features
are
preserved
by
tradition
or
can
be
restored
by
the
use
of
reasonable
conjecture
presents
several
important
analogies
to
the
modern
thracian
carnival
in
respect
of
a
mock
marriage
of
disguised
actors
and
a
ceremony
of
ploughing
the
resemblance
between
the
ancient
and
the
modern
ritual
would
be
still
closer
if
some
eminent
modern
scholars
who
wrote
before
the
discovery
of
the
thracian
carnival
and
whose
judgment
was
therefore
not
biassed
by
its
analogy
to
the
athenian
festival
are
right
in
holding
that
another
important
feature
of
the
anthesteria
was
the
dramatic
death
and
resurrection
of
dionysus
they
point
out
that
at
the
marriage
of
dionysus
fourteen
sacred
women
officiated
at
fourteen
altars
that
the
number
of
the
titans
who
tore
dionysus
in
pieces
was
fourteen
namely
seven
male
and
seven
female
and
that
osiris
a
god
who
in
some
respects
corresponded
closely
to
dionysus
is
said
to
have
been
rent
by
typhon
into
fourteen
fragments
hence
they
conjecture
that
at
athens
the
body
of
dionysus
was
dramatically
broken
into
fourteen
fragments
one
for
each
of
the
fourteen
altars
and
that
it
was
afterwards
dramatically
pieced
together
and
restored
to
life
by
the
fourteen
sacred
women
just
as
the
broken
body
of
osiris
was
pieced
together
by
a
company
of
gods
and
goddesses
and
restored
to
life
by
his
sister
isis
the
conjecture
is
ingenious
and
plausible
but
with
our
existing
sources
of
information
it
must
remain
a
conjecture
and
nothing
more
could
it
be
established
it
would
forge
another
strong
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
which
binds
the
modern
thracian
carnival
to
the
ancient
athenian
anthesteria
for
in
that
case
the
drama
of
the
divine
death
and
resurrection
would
have
to
be
added
to
the
other
features
which
these
two
festivals
of
spring
possess
in
common
and
we
should
have
to
confess
that
greece
had
what
we
may
call
its
good
friday
and
its
easter
sunday
long
before
the
events
took
place
in
judaea
which
diffused
these
two
annual
commemorations
of
the
dying
and
reviving
god
over
a
great
part
of
the
civilised
world
from
so
simple
a
beginning
may
flow
consequences
so
and
impressive
for
in
the
light
of
the
rude
thracian
ceremony
we
may
surmise
that
the
high
tragedy
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
dionysus
originated
in
a
rustic
mummers
play
acted
by
ploughmen
for
the
purpose
of
fertilising
the
brown
earth
which
they
turned
up
with
the
gleaming
share
in
sunshiny
days
of
spring
as
they
followed
the
oxen
down
the
long
furrows
in
the
fallow
field
later
on
we
shall
see
that
a
play
of
the
same
sort
is
still
acted
or
was
acted
down
to
recent
years
by
english
yokels
on
plough
monday
but
before
we
pass
from
the
tragic
myth
and
ritual
of
dionysus
to
the
sweeter
story
and
milder
worship
of
demeter
and
persephone
the
true
greek
deities
of
the
corn
it
is
fair
to
admit
that
the
legends
of
human
sacrifice
which
have
left
so
dark
a
stain
on
the
memory
of
the
old
thracian
god
may
have
been
nothing
more
than
mere
misinterpretations
of
a
sacrificial
ritual
in
which
an
animal
victim
was
treated
as
a
human
being
for
example
at
tenedos
the
calf
sacrificed
to
dionysus
was
shod
in
buskins
and
the
mother
cow
was
tended
like
a
woman
in
at
rome
a
was
sacrificed
to
vedijovis
as
if
it
were
a
human
victim
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
is
equally
possible
and
perhaps
more
probable
that
these
curious
rites
were
themselves
mitigations
of
an
older
and
ruder
custom
of
sacrificing
human
beings
and
that
the
later
pretence
of
treating
the
sacrificial
victims
as
if
they
were
human
beings
was
merely
part
of
a
pious
and
merciful
fraud
which
palmed
off
on
the
deity
less
precious
victims
than
living
men
and
women
this
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
undoubted
cases
in
which
animals
have
been
substituted
for
human
victims
on
the
whole
we
may
conclude
that
neither
the
polished
manners
of
a
later
age
nor
the
glamour
which
greek
poetry
and
art
threw
over
the
figure
of
dionysus
sufficed
to
conceal
or
erase
the
deep
lines
of
savagery
and
cruelty
imprinted
on
the
features
of
this
barbarous
deity
chapter
ii
demeter
and
persephone
dionysus
was
not
the
only
greek
deity
whose
tragic
story
and
ritual
appear
to
reflect
the
decay
and
revival
of
vegetation
in
another
form
and
with
a
different
application
the
old
tale
reappears
in
the
myth
of
demeter
and
persephone
substantially
their
myth
is
identical
with
the
syrian
one
of
aphrodite
astarte
and
adonis
the
phrygian
one
of
cybele
and
attis
and
the
egyptian
one
of
isis
and
osiris
in
the
greek
fable
as
in
its
asiatic
and
egyptian
counterparts
a
goddess
mourns
the
loss
of
a
loved
one
who
personifies
the
vegetation
more
especially
the
corn
which
dies
in
winter
to
revive
in
spring
only
whereas
the
oriental
imagination
figured
the
loved
and
lost
one
as
a
dead
lover
or
a
dead
husband
lamented
by
his
leman
or
his
wife
greek
fancy
embodied
the
same
idea
in
the
tenderer
and
purer
form
of
a
dead
daughter
bewailed
by
her
sorrowing
mother
the
oldest
literary
document
which
narrates
the
myth
of
demeter
and
persephone
is
the
beautiful
homeric
to
which
critics
assign
to
the
seventh
century
before
our
era
the
object
of
the
poem
is
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
and
the
complete
silence
of
the
poet
as
to
athens
and
the
athenians
who
in
after
ages
took
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
festival
renders
it
probable
that
the
hymn
was
composed
in
the
far
off
time
when
eleusis
was
still
a
petty
independent
state
and
before
the
stately
procession
of
the
mysteries
had
begun
to
defile
in
bright
september
days
over
the
low
chain
of
barren
rocky
hills
which
divides
the
flat
eleusinian
cornland
from
the
more
spacious
expanse
of
the
athenian
plain
be
that
as
it
may
the
hymn
reveals
to
us
the
conception
which
the
writer
entertained
of
the
character
and
functions
of
the
two
goddesses
their
natural
shapes
stand
out
sharply
enough
under
the
thin
veil
of
poetical
imagery
the
youthful
persephone
so
runs
the
tale
was
gathering
roses
and
lilies
crocuses
and
violets
hyacinths
and
narcissuses
in
a
lush
meadow
when
the
earth
gaped
and
pluto
lord
of
the
dead
issuing
from
the
abyss
carried
her
off
on
his
golden
car
to
be
his
bride
and
queen
in
the
gloomy
subterranean
world
her
sorrowing
mother
demeter
with
her
yellow
tresses
veiled
in
a
dark
mourning
mantle
sought
her
over
land
and
sea
and
learning
from
the
sun
her
daughter
s
fate
she
withdrew
in
high
dudgeon
from
the
gods
and
took
up
her
abode
at
eleusis
where
she
presented
herself
to
the
king
s
daughters
in
the
guise
of
an
old
woman
sitting
sadly
under
the
shadow
of
an
olive
tree
beside
the
maiden
s
well
to
which
the
damsels
had
come
to
draw
water
in
bronze
pitchers
for
their
father
s
house
in
her
wrath
at
her
bereavement
the
goddess
suffered
not
the
seed
to
grow
in
the
earth
but
kept
it
hidden
under
ground
and
she
vowed
that
never
would
she
set
foot
on
olympus
and
never
would
she
let
the
corn
sprout
till
her
lost
daughter
should
be
restored
to
her
vainly
the
oxen
dragged
the
ploughs
to
and
fro
in
the
fields
vainly
the
sower
dropped
the
barley
seed
in
the
brown
furrows
nothing
came
up
from
the
parched
and
crumbling
soil
even
the
rarian
plain
near
eleusis
which
was
wont
to
wave
with
yellow
harvests
lay
bare
and
fallow
mankind
would
have
perished
of
hunger
and
the
gods
would
have
been
robbed
of
the
sacrifices
which
were
their
due
if
zeus
in
alarm
had
not
commanded
pluto
to
disgorge
his
prey
to
restore
his
bride
persephone
to
her
mother
demeter
the
grim
lord
of
the
dead
smiled
and
obeyed
but
before
he
sent
back
his
queen
to
the
upper
air
on
a
golden
car
he
gave
her
the
seed
of
a
pomegranate
to
eat
which
ensured
that
she
would
return
to
him
but
zeus
stipulated
that
henceforth
persephone
should
spend
two
thirds
of
every
year
with
her
mother
and
the
gods
in
the
upper
world
and
one
third
of
the
year
with
her
husband
in
the
nether
world
from
which
she
was
to
return
year
by
year
when
the
earth
was
gay
with
spring
flowers
gladly
the
daughter
then
returned
to
the
sunshine
gladly
her
mother
received
her
and
fell
upon
her
neck
and
in
her
joy
at
recovering
the
lost
one
demeter
made
the
corn
to
sprout
from
the
clods
of
the
ploughed
fields
and
all
the
broad
earth
to
be
heavy
with
leaves
and
blossoms
and
straightway
she
went
and
shewed
this
happy
sight
to
the
princes
of
eleusis
to
triptolemus
eumolpus
diocles
and
to
the
king
celeus
himself
and
moreover
she
revealed
to
them
her
sacred
rites
and
mysteries
blessed
says
the
poet
is
the
mortal
man
who
has
seen
these
things
but
he
who
has
had
no
share
of
them
in
life
will
never
be
happy
in
death
when
he
has
descended
into
the
darkness
of
the
grave
so
the
two
goddesses
departed
to
dwell
in
bliss
with
the
gods
on
olympus
and
the
bard
ends
the
hymn
with
a
pious
prayer
to
demeter
and
persephone
that
they
would
be
pleased
to
grant
him
a
livelihood
in
return
for
his
song
it
has
been
generally
recognised
and
indeed
it
seems
scarcely
open
to
doubt
that
the
main
theme
which
the
poet
set
before
himself
in
composing
this
hymn
was
to
describe
the
traditional
foundation
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
by
the
goddess
demeter
the
whole
poem
leads
up
to
the
transformation
scene
in
which
the
bare
leafless
expanse
of
the
eleusinian
plain
is
suddenly
turned
at
the
will
of
the
goddess
into
a
vast
sheet
of
ruddy
corn
the
beneficent
deity
takes
the
princes
of
eleusis
shews
them
what
she
has
done
teaches
them
her
mystic
rites
and
vanishes
with
her
daughter
to
heaven
the
revelation
of
the
mysteries
is
the
triumphal
close
of
the
piece
this
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
a
more
minute
examination
of
the
poem
which
proves
that
the
poet
has
given
not
merely
a
general
account
of
the
foundation
of
the
mysteries
but
also
in
more
or
less
veiled
language
mythical
explanations
of
the
origin
of
particular
rites
which
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
formed
essential
features
of
the
festival
amongst
the
rites
as
to
which
the
poet
thus
drops
significant
hints
are
the
preliminary
fast
of
the
candidates
for
initiation
the
torchlight
procession
the
vigil
the
sitting
of
the
candidates
veiled
and
in
silence
on
stools
covered
with
sheepskins
the
use
of
scurrilous
language
the
breaking
of
ribald
jests
and
the
solemn
communion
with
the
divinity
by
participation
in
a
draught
of
from
a
holy
chalice
but
there
is
yet
another
and
a
deeper
secret
of
the
mysteries
which
the
author
of
the
poem
appears
to
have
divulged
under
cover
of
his
narrative
he
tells
us
how
as
soon
as
she
had
transformed
the
barren
brown
expanse
of
the
eleusinian
plain
into
a
field
of
golden
grain
she
gladdened
the
eyes
of
triptolemus
and
the
other
eleusinian
princes
by
shewing
them
the
growing
or
standing
corn
when
we
compare
this
part
of
the
story
with
the
statement
of
a
christian
writer
of
the
second
century
hippolytus
that
the
very
heart
of
the
mysteries
consisted
in
shewing
to
the
initiated
a
reaped
ear
of
corn
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
poet
of
the
hymn
was
well
acquainted
with
this
solemn
rite
and
that
he
deliberately
intended
to
explain
its
origin
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
he
explained
other
rites
of
the
mysteries
namely
by
representing
demeter
as
having
set
the
example
of
performing
the
ceremony
in
her
own
person
thus
myth
and
ritual
mutually
explain
and
confirm
each
other
the
poet
of
the
seventh
century
before
our
era
gives
us
the
could
not
without
sacrilege
have
revealed
the
ritual
the
christian
father
reveals
the
ritual
and
his
revelation
accords
perfectly
with
the
veiled
hint
of
the
old
poet
on
the
whole
then
we
may
with
many
modern
scholars
confidently
accept
the
statement
of
the
learned
christian
father
clement
of
alexandria
that
the
myth
of
demeter
and
persephone
was
acted
as
a
sacred
drama
in
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
but
if
the
myth
was
acted
as
a
part
perhaps
as
the
principal
part
of
the
most
famous
and
solemn
religious
rites
of
ancient
greece
we
have
still
to
enquire
what
was
after
all
stripped
of
later
accretions
the
original
kernel
of
the
myth
which
appears
to
later
ages
surrounded
and
transfigured
by
an
aureole
of
awe
and
mystery
lit
up
by
some
of
the
most
brilliant
rays
of
grecian
literature
and
art
if
we
follow
the
indications
given
by
our
oldest
literary
authority
on
the
subject
the
author
of
the
homeric
hymn
to
demeter
the
riddle
is
not
hard
to
read
the
figures
of
the
two
goddesses
the
mother
and
the
daughter
resolve
themselves
into
personifications
of
the
corn
at
least
this
appears
to
be
fairly
certain
for
the
daughter
persephone
the
goddess
who
spends
three
or
according
to
another
version
of
the
myth
six
months
of
every
year
with
the
dead
under
ground
and
the
remainder
of
the
year
with
the
living
above
ground
in
whose
absence
the
barley
seed
is
hidden
in
the
earth
and
the
fields
lie
bare
and
fallow
on
whose
return
in
spring
to
the
upper
world
the
corn
shoots
up
from
the
clods
and
the
earth
is
heavy
with
leaves
and
goddess
can
surely
be
nothing
else
than
a
mythical
embodiment
of
the
vegetation
and
particularly
of
the
corn
which
is
buried
under
the
soil
for
some
months
of
every
winter
and
comes
to
life
again
as
from
the
grave
in
the
sprouting
cornstalks
and
the
opening
flowers
and
foliage
of
every
spring
no
other
reasonable
and
probable
explanation
of
persephone
seems
possible
and
if
the
daughter
goddess
was
a
personification
of
the
young
corn
of
the
present
year
may
not
the
mother
goddess
be
a
personification
of
the
old
corn
of
last
year
which
has
given
birth
to
the
new
crops
the
only
alternative
to
this
view
of
demeter
would
seem
to
be
to
suppose
that
she
is
a
personification
of
the
earth
from
whose
broad
bosom
the
corn
and
all
other
plants
spring
up
and
of
which
accordingly
they
may
appropriately
enough
be
regarded
as
the
daughters
this
view
of
the
original
nature
of
demeter
has
indeed
been
taken
by
some
writers
both
ancient
and
modern
and
it
is
one
which
can
be
reasonably
maintained
but
it
appears
to
have
been
rejected
by
the
author
of
the
homeric
hymn
to
demeter
for
he
not
only
distinguishes
demeter
from
the
personified
earth
but
places
the
two
in
the
sharpest
opposition
to
each
other
he
tells
us
that
it
was
earth
who
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
zeus
and
to
please
pluto
lured
persephone
to
her
doom
by
causing
the
narcissuses
to
grow
which
tempted
the
young
goddess
to
stray
far
beyond
the
reach
of
help
in
the
lush
meadow
thus
demeter
of
the
hymn
far
from
being
identical
with
the
must
have
regarded
that
divinity
as
her
worst
enemy
since
it
was
to
her
insidious
wiles
that
she
owed
the
loss
of
her
daughter
but
if
the
demeter
of
the
hymn
can
not
have
been
a
personification
of
the
earth
the
only
alternative
apparently
is
to
conclude
that
she
was
a
personification
of
the
corn
with
this
conclusion
all
the
indications
of
the
seem
to
harmonise
he
certainly
represents
demeter
as
the
goddess
by
whose
power
and
at
whose
pleasure
the
corn
either
grows
or
remains
hidden
in
the
ground
and
to
what
deity
can
such
powers
be
so
fittingly
ascribed
as
to
the
goddess
of
the
corn
he
calls
demeter
yellow
and
tells
how
her
yellow
tresses
flowed
down
on
her
shoulders
could
any
colour
be
more
appropriate
with
which
to
paint
the
divinity
of
the
yellow
grain
the
same
identification
of
demeter
with
the
ripe
the
yellow
corn
is
made
even
more
clearly
by
a
still
older
poet
homer
himself
or
at
all
events
the
author
of
the
fifth
book
of
the
there
we
read
and
even
as
the
wind
carries
the
chaff
about
the
sacred
when
men
are
winnowing
what
time
yellow
demeter
sifts
the
corn
from
the
chaff
on
the
hurrying
blast
so
that
the
heaps
of
chaff
grow
white
below
so
were
the
achaeans
whitened
above
by
the
cloud
of
dust
which
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
spurned
to
the
brazen
here
the
yellow
demeter
who
sifts
the
grain
from
the
chaff
at
the
can
hardly
be
any
other
than
the
goddess
of
the
yellow
corn
she
can
not
be
the
for
what
has
the
to
do
with
the
grain
and
the
chaff
blown
about
a
with
this
interpretation
it
agrees
that
elsewhere
homer
speaks
of
men
eating
demeter
s
corn
and
still
more
definitely
hesiod
speaks
of
the
annual
store
of
food
which
the
earth
bears
demeter
s
corn
thus
distinguishing
the
goddess
of
the
corn
from
the
earth
which
bears
it
still
more
clearly
does
a
later
greek
poet
personify
the
corn
as
demeter
when
in
allusion
to
the
time
of
the
he
says
that
then
the
sturdy
swains
cleave
demeter
limb
from
and
just
as
the
ripe
or
yellow
corn
was
personified
as
the
yellow
demeter
so
the
unripe
or
green
corn
was
personified
as
the
green
demeter
in
that
character
the
goddess
had
sanctuaries
at
athens
and
other
places
sacrifices
were
appropriately
offered
to
green
demeter
in
spring
when
the
earth
was
growing
green
with
the
fresh
vegetation
and
the
victims
included
sows
big
with
young
which
no
doubt
were
intended
not
merely
to
symbolise
but
magically
to
promote
the
abundance
of
the
crops
in
greek
the
various
kinds
of
corn
were
called
by
the
general
name
of
demeter
s
fruits
just
as
in
latin
they
were
called
the
fruits
or
gifts
of
ceres
an
expression
which
survives
in
the
english
word
cereals
tradition
ran
that
before
demeter
s
time
men
neither
cultivated
corn
nor
tilled
the
ground
but
roamed
the
mountains
and
woods
in
search
of
the
wild
fruits
which
the
earth
produced
spontaneously
from
her
womb
for
their
subsistence
the
tradition
clearly
implies
not
only
that
demeter
was
the
goddess
of
the
corn
but
that
she
was
different
from
and
younger
than
the
goddess
of
the
earth
since
it
is
expressly
affirmed
that
before
demeter
s
time
the
earth
existed
and
supplied
mankind
with
nourishment
in
the
shape
of
wild
herbs
grasses
flowers
and
fruits
in
ancient
art
demeter
and
persephone
are
characterised
as
goddesses
of
the
corn
by
the
crowns
of
corn
which
they
wear
on
their
heads
and
by
the
stalks
of
corn
which
they
hold
in
their
hands
theocritus
describes
a
smiling
image
of
demeter
standing
by
a
heap
of
yellow
grain
on
a
and
grasping
sheaves
of
barley
and
poppies
in
both
her
hands
indeed
corn
and
poppies
singly
or
together
were
a
frequent
symbol
of
the
goddess
as
we
learn
not
only
from
the
testimony
of
ancient
writers
but
from
many
existing
monuments
of
classical
art
the
naturalness
of
the
symbol
can
be
doubted
by
no
one
who
has
who
has
not
seen
field
of
yellow
corn
bespangled
thick
with
scarlet
poppies
and
we
need
not
resort
to
the
shifts
of
an
ancient
mythologist
who
explained
the
symbolism
of
the
poppy
in
demeter
s
hand
by
comparing
the
globular
shape
of
the
poppy
to
the
roundness
of
our
globe
the
unevenness
of
its
edges
to
hills
and
valleys
and
the
hollow
interior
of
the
scarlet
flower
to
the
caves
and
dens
of
the
earth
if
only
students
would
study
the
little
black
and
white
books
of
men
less
and
the
great
book
of
nature
more
if
they
would
more
frequently
exchange
the
heavy
air
and
the
dim
light
of
libraries
for
the
freshness
and
the
sunshine
of
the
open
sky
if
they
would
oftener
unbend
their
minds
by
rural
walks
between
fields
of
waving
corn
beside
rivers
rippling
by
under
grey
willows
or
down
green
lanes
where
the
hedges
are
white
with
the
hawthorn
bloom
or
red
with
wild
roses
they
might
sometimes
learn
more
about
primitive
religion
than
can
be
gathered
from
many
dusty
volumes
in
which
theories
are
set
forth
with
all
the
tedious
parade
of
learning
nowhere
perhaps
in
the
monuments
of
greek
art
is
the
character
of
persephone
as
a
personification
of
the
young
corn
sprouting
in
spring
portrayed
more
gracefully
and
more
truly
than
on
a
coin
of
lampsacus
of
the
fourth
century
before
our
era
on
it
we
see
the
goddess
in
the
very
act
of
rising
from
the
earth
her
face
is
upraised
in
her
hand
are
three
ears
of
corn
and
others
together
with
grapes
are
springing
behind
her
shoulder
complete
is
here
the
identification
of
the
goddess
and
her
attribute
she
is
embowered
amid
the
ears
of
growing
corn
and
like
it
half
buried
in
the
ground
she
does
not
make
the
corn
and
vine
grow
but
she
the
corn
and
vine
growing
and
returning
again
to
the
face
of
the
earth
after
lying
hidden
in
its
depths
certainly
the
artist
who
designed
this
beautiful
figure
thoroughly
understood
hellenic
as
the
goddess
who
first
bestowed
corn
on
mankind
and
taught
them
to
sow
and
cultivate
it
demeter
was
naturally
invoked
and
propitiated
by
farmers
before
they
undertook
the
various
operations
of
the
agricultural
year
in
autumn
when
he
heard
the
sonorous
trumpeting
of
the
cranes
as
they
winged
their
way
southward
in
vast
flocks
high
overhead
the
greek
husbandman
knew
that
the
rains
were
near
and
that
the
time
of
ploughing
was
at
hand
but
before
he
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
he
prayed
to
underground
zeus
and
to
holy
demeter
for
a
heavy
crop
of
demeter
s
sacred
corn
then
he
guided
the
plough
down
the
field
turning
up
the
brown
earth
with
the
share
while
a
swain
followed
close
behind
with
a
hoe
who
covered
up
the
seed
as
fast
as
it
fell
to
protect
it
from
the
voracious
birds
that
fluttered
and
twittered
at
the
but
while
the
ordinary
greek
farmer
took
the
signal
for
ploughing
from
the
clangour
of
the
cranes
hesiod
and
other
writers
who
aimed
at
greater
exactness
laid
it
down
as
a
rule
that
the
ploughing
should
begin
with
the
autumnal
setting
of
the
pleiades
in
the
morning
which
in
hesiod
s
time
fell
on
the
of
october
the
month
in
which
the
pleiades
set
in
the
morning
was
generally
recognised
by
the
greeks
as
the
month
of
sowing
it
corresponded
apparently
in
part
to
our
october
in
part
to
our
november
the
athenians
called
it
pyanepsion
the
boeotians
named
it
significantly
damatrius
that
is
demeter
s
month
and
they
celebrated
a
feast
of
mourning
because
says
plutarch
who
as
a
boeotian
speaks
with
authority
on
such
a
matter
demeter
was
then
in
mourning
for
the
descent
of
persephone
is
it
possible
to
express
more
clearly
the
true
original
nature
of
persephone
as
the
which
has
just
been
buried
in
the
earth
the
obvious
the
almost
inevitable
conclusion
did
not
escape
plutarch
he
tells
us
that
the
mournful
rites
which
were
held
at
the
time
of
the
autumn
sowing
nominally
commemorated
the
actions
of
deities
but
that
the
real
sadness
was
for
the
fruits
of
the
earth
some
of
which
at
that
season
dropped
of
themselves
and
vanished
from
the
trees
while
others
in
the
shape
of
seed
were
committed
with
anxious
thoughts
to
the
ground
by
men
who
scraped
the
earth
and
then
huddled
it
up
over
the
seed
just
as
if
they
were
burying
and
mourning
for
the
dead
surely
this
interpretation
of
the
custom
and
of
the
myth
of
persephone
is
not
only
beautiful
but
true
and
just
as
the
greek
husbandman
prayed
to
the
corn
goddess
when
he
committed
the
seed
with
anxious
forebodings
to
the
furrows
so
after
he
had
reaped
the
harvest
and
brought
back
the
yellow
sheaves
with
rejoicing
to
the
he
paid
the
bountiful
goddess
her
dues
in
the
form
of
a
of
golden
grain
theocritus
has
painted
for
us
in
glowing
colours
a
picture
of
a
rustic
as
it
fell
on
a
bright
autumn
day
some
two
thousand
years
ago
in
the
little
greek
island
of
the
poet
tells
us
how
he
went
with
two
friends
from
the
city
to
attend
a
festival
given
by
farmers
who
were
offering
to
demeter
from
the
store
of
barley
with
which
she
had
filled
their
barns
the
day
was
warm
indeed
so
hot
that
the
very
lizards
which
love
to
bask
and
run
about
in
the
sun
were
slumbering
in
the
crevices
of
the
and
not
a
lark
soared
carolling
into
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
yet
despite
the
great
heat
there
were
everywhere
signs
of
autumn
all
things
says
the
poet
smelt
of
summer
but
smelt
of
autumn
indeed
the
day
was
really
autumnal
for
a
who
met
the
friends
on
their
way
to
the
rural
asked
them
whether
they
were
bound
for
the
treading
of
the
grapes
in
the
and
when
they
had
reached
their
destination
and
reclined
at
ease
in
the
dappled
shade
of
poplars
and
elms
with
the
babble
of
a
neighbouring
fountain
the
buzz
of
the
cicadas
the
hum
of
bees
and
the
cooing
of
doves
in
their
ears
the
ripe
apples
and
pears
rolled
in
the
grass
at
their
feet
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
were
bowed
down
to
the
earth
with
the
weight
of
their
purple
fruit
so
couched
on
soft
beds
of
fragrant
lentisk
they
passed
the
sultry
hours
singing
ditties
alternately
while
a
rustic
image
of
demeter
to
whom
the
honours
of
the
day
were
paid
stood
smiling
beside
a
heap
of
yellow
grain
on
the
with
and
poppies
in
her
hands
in
this
description
the
time
of
year
when
the
was
celebrated
is
clearly
marked
apart
from
the
mention
of
the
ripe
apples
pears
and
plums
the
reference
to
the
treading
of
the
grapes
is
decisive
the
greeks
gather
and
press
the
grapes
in
the
first
half
of
october
and
accordingly
it
is
to
this
date
that
the
described
by
theocritus
must
be
assigned
at
the
present
day
in
greece
the
immediately
precedes
the
vintage
the
grain
being
reaped
and
garnered
at
the
end
of
september
travelling
in
rural
districts
of
argolis
and
arcadia
at
that
time
of
the
year
you
pass
from
time
to
time
piles
of
the
cobs
laid
up
ready
to
be
shelled
or
again
heaps
of
the
yellow
grain
beside
the
pods
but
maize
was
unknown
to
the
ancient
greeks
who
like
their
modern
descendants
reaped
their
wheat
and
barley
crops
much
earlier
in
the
summer
usually
from
the
end
of
april
till
june
however
we
may
conclude
that
the
day
immortalised
by
theocritus
was
one
of
those
autumn
days
of
great
heat
and
effulgent
beauty
which
in
greece
may
occur
at
any
time
up
to
the
very
verge
of
winter
i
remember
such
a
day
at
panopeus
on
the
borders
of
phocis
and
boeotia
it
was
the
first
of
november
yet
the
sun
shone
in
cloudless
splendour
and
the
heat
was
so
great
that
when
i
had
examined
the
magnificent
remains
of
ancient
greek
which
crown
the
summit
of
the
hill
it
was
delicious
to
repose
on
a
grassy
slope
in
the
shade
of
some
fine
and
to
inhale
the
sweet
scent
of
the
wild
thyme
which
perfumed
all
the
air
but
it
was
summer
s
farewell
next
morning
the
weather
had
completely
changed
a
grey
november
sky
lowered
sadly
overhead
and
grey
mists
hung
like
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
barren
mountains
which
shut
in
the
fatal
plain
of
chaeronea
thus
we
may
infer
that
in
the
rural
districts
of
ancient
greece
farmers
offered
their
of
the
barley
harvest
to
demeter
in
autumn
about
the
time
when
the
grapes
were
being
trodden
in
the
and
the
ripe
apples
and
pears
littered
the
ground
in
the
orchards
at
first
sight
the
lateness
of
the
festival
in
the
year
is
surprising
for
in
the
lowlands
of
greece
at
the
present
day
barley
is
reaped
at
the
end
of
april
and
wheat
in
may
and
in
antiquity
the
time
of
harvest
would
seem
not
to
have
been
very
different
for
hesiod
bids
the
husbandman
put
the
sickle
to
the
corn
at
the
morning
rising
of
the
pleiades
which
in
his
time
took
place
on
the
eleventh
of
may
but
if
the
harvest
was
reaped
in
spring
or
early
summer
why
defer
the
offerings
of
corn
to
the
corn
goddess
until
the
middle
of
autumn
the
reason
for
the
delay
is
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware
explained
by
any
ancient
author
and
accordingly
it
must
remain
for
us
a
matter
of
conjecture
i
surmise
that
the
reason
may
have
been
a
calculation
on
the
part
of
the
practical
farmer
that
the
best
time
to
propitiate
the
corn
goddess
was
not
after
harvest
when
he
had
got
all
that
was
to
be
got
out
of
her
but
immediately
before
ploughing
and
sowing
when
he
had
everything
to
hope
from
her
and
everything
to
fear
from
her
displeasure
when
he
had
reaped
his
corn
and
the
sheaves
had
been
safely
garnered
in
his
barns
he
might
so
to
say
snap
his
fingers
at
the
corn
goddess
what
could
she
do
for
him
on
the
bare
which
lay
scorched
and
baking
under
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
all
the
long
rainless
summer
through
but
matters
wore
a
very
different
aspect
when
with
the
shortening
and
cooling
of
the
days
he
began
to
scan
the
sky
for
clouds
and
to
listen
for
the
cries
of
the
cranes
as
they
flew
southward
heralding
by
their
notes
the
approach
of
the
autumnal
rains
then
he
knew
that
the
time
had
come
to
break
up
the
ground
that
it
might
receive
the
seed
and
be
fertilised
by
the
refreshing
water
of
heaven
then
he
bethought
him
of
the
corn
goddess
once
more
and
brought
forth
from
the
grange
a
share
of
the
harvested
corn
with
which
to
woo
her
favour
and
induce
her
to
quicken
the
grain
which
he
was
about
to
commit
to
the
earth
on
this
theory
the
greek
offering
of
was
prompted
not
so
much
by
gratitude
for
past
favours
as
by
a
shrewd
eye
to
favours
to
come
and
perhaps
this
interpretation
of
the
custom
does
no
serious
injustice
to
the
cool
phlegmatic
temper
of
the
bucolic
mind
which
is
more
apt
to
be
moved
by
considerations
of
profit
than
by
sentiment
at
all
events
the
reasons
suggested
for
delaying
the
accord
perfectly
with
the
natural
conditions
and
seasons
of
farming
in
greece
for
in
that
country
the
summer
is
practically
rainless
and
during
the
long
months
of
heat
and
drought
the
cultivation
of
the
two
ancient
cereals
barley
and
wheat
is
at
a
standstill
the
first
rains
of
autumn
fall
about
the
middle
of
october
and
that
was
the
greek
farmer
s
great
time
for
ploughing
and
sowing
hence
we
should
expect
him
to
make
his
offering
of
to
the
corn
goddess
shortly
before
he
ploughed
and
sowed
and
this
expectation
is
entirely
confirmed
by
the
date
which
we
have
inferred
for
the
offering
from
the
evidence
of
theocritus
thus
the
sacrifice
of
barley
to
demeter
in
the
autumn
would
seem
to
have
been
not
so
much
a
as
a
bribe
judiciously
administered
to
her
at
the
very
moment
of
all
the
year
when
her
services
were
most
urgently
wanted
when
with
the
progress
of
civilisation
a
number
of
petty
agricultural
communities
have
merged
into
a
single
state
dependent
for
its
subsistence
mainly
on
the
cultivation
of
the
ground
it
commonly
happens
that
though
every
farmer
continues
to
perform
for
himself
the
simple
old
rites
designed
to
ensure
the
blessing
of
the
gods
on
his
crops
the
government
undertakes
to
celebrate
similar
though
more
stately
and
elaborate
rites
on
behalf
of
the
whole
people
lest
the
neglect
of
public
worship
should
draw
down
on
the
country
the
wrath
of
the
offended
deities
hence
it
comes
about
that
for
all
their
pomp
and
splendour
the
national
festivals
of
such
states
are
often
merely
magnified
and
embellished
copies
of
homely
rites
and
uncouth
observances
carried
out
by
rustics
in
the
open
fields
in
barns
and
on
in
ancient
egypt
the
religion
of
isis
and
osiris
furnishes
examples
of
solemnities
which
have
been
thus
raised
from
the
humble
rank
of
rural
festivities
to
the
dignity
of
national
celebrations
and
in
ancient
greece
a
like
development
may
be
traced
in
the
religion
of
demeter
if
the
greek
ploughman
prayed
to
demeter
and
underground
zeus
for
a
good
crop
before
he
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
in
autumn
the
authorities
of
the
athenian
state
celebrated
about
the
same
time
and
for
the
same
purpose
a
public
festival
in
honour
of
demeter
at
eleusis
it
was
called
the
proerosia
which
signifies
before
the
ploughing
and
as
the
festival
was
dedicated
to
her
demeter
herself
bore
the
name
of
proerosia
tradition
ran
that
once
on
a
time
the
whole
world
was
desolated
by
a
famine
and
that
to
remedy
the
evil
the
pythian
oracle
bade
the
athenians
offer
the
sacrifice
of
the
proerosia
on
behalf
of
all
men
they
did
so
and
the
famine
ceased
accordingly
hence
to
testify
their
gratitude
for
the
deliverance
people
sent
the
of
their
harvest
from
all
quarters
to
athens
but
the
exact
date
at
which
the
proerosia
or
festival
before
ploughing
took
place
is
somewhat
uncertain
and
enquirers
are
divided
in
opinion
as
to
whether
it
fell
before
or
after
the
great
mysteries
which
began
on
the
fifteenth
or
sixteenth
of
boedromion
a
month
corresponding
roughly
to
our
september
another
name
for
the
festival
was
proarcturia
that
is
before
arcturus
which
points
to
a
date
either
before
the
middle
of
september
when
arcturus
is
a
morning
star
or
before
the
end
of
october
when
arcturus
is
an
evening
star
in
favour
of
the
earlier
date
it
may
be
said
first
that
the
morning
phase
of
arcturus
was
well
known
and
much
observed
because
it
marked
the
middle
of
autumn
whereas
little
use
was
made
of
the
evening
phase
of
arcturus
for
the
purpose
of
dating
and
second
that
in
an
official
athenian
inscription
the
festival
before
ploughing
is
mentioned
immediately
before
the
great
mysteries
on
the
other
hand
in
favour
of
the
later
date
it
may
be
said
that
as
the
autumnal
rains
in
greece
set
in
about
the
middle
of
october
the
latter
part
of
that
month
would
be
a
more
suitable
time
for
a
ceremony
at
the
opening
of
ploughing
than
the
middle
of
september
when
the
soil
is
still
parched
with
the
summer
drought
and
second
that
this
date
is
confirmed
by
a
greek
inscription
of
the
fourth
or
third
century
found
at
eleusis
in
which
the
festival
before
ploughing
is
apparently
mentioned
in
the
month
of
pyanepsion
immediately
before
the
festival
of
the
pyanepsia
which
was
held
on
the
seventh
day
of
that
month
it
is
difficult
to
decide
between
these
conflicting
arguments
but
on
the
whole
i
incline
not
without
hesitation
to
agree
with
some
eminent
modern
authorities
in
placing
the
festival
before
ploughing
in
pyanepsion
october
after
the
mysteries
rather
than
in
boedromion
september
before
the
mysteries
however
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
as
the
attic
months
like
the
greek
months
generally
were
lunar
their
position
in
the
solar
year
necessarily
varied
from
year
to
year
and
though
these
variations
were
periodically
corrected
by
intercalation
nevertheless
the
beginning
of
each
attic
month
sometimes
diverged
by
several
weeks
from
the
beginning
of
the
corresponding
month
to
which
we
equate
it
from
this
it
follows
that
the
great
mysteries
which
were
always
dated
by
the
calendar
month
must
have
annually
shifted
their
place
somewhat
in
the
solar
year
whereas
the
festival
before
ploughing
if
it
was
indeed
dated
either
by
the
morning
or
by
the
evening
phase
of
arcturus
must
have
occupied
a
fixed
place
in
the
solar
year
hence
it
appears
to
be
not
impossible
that
the
great
mysteries
oscillating
to
and
fro
with
the
inconstant
moon
may
sometimes
have
fallen
before
and
sometimes
after
the
festival
before
ploughing
which
apparently
always
remained
true
to
the
constant
star
at
least
this
possibility
which
seems
to
have
been
overlooked
by
previous
enquirers
deserves
to
be
taken
into
account
it
is
a
corollary
from
the
shifting
dates
of
the
lunar
months
that
the
official
greek
calendar
in
spite
of
its
appearance
of
exactness
really
furnished
the
ancient
farmer
with
little
trustworthy
guidance
as
to
the
proper
seasons
for
conducting
the
various
operations
of
agriculture
and
he
was
well
advised
in
trusting
to
various
natural
timekeepers
such
as
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
constellations
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
migratory
birds
the
flowering
of
certain
plants
the
ripening
of
fruits
and
the
setting
in
of
the
rains
rather
than
to
the
fallacious
indications
of
the
public
calendar
it
is
by
natural
timekeepers
and
not
by
calendar
months
that
hesiod
determines
the
seasons
of
the
farmer
s
year
in
the
poem
which
is
the
oldest
existing
treatise
on
husbandry
just
as
the
ploughman
s
prayer
to
demeter
before
he
drove
the
share
through
the
clods
of
the
field
was
taken
up
and
reverberated
so
to
say
with
a
great
volume
of
sound
in
the
public
prayers
which
the
athenian
state
annually
offered
to
the
goddess
before
the
ploughing
on
behalf
of
the
whole
world
so
the
simple
of
barley
presented
to
the
rustic
demeter
under
the
dappled
shade
of
rustling
poplars
and
elms
on
the
in
cos
were
repeated
year
by
year
on
a
grander
scale
in
the
of
the
barley
and
wheat
harvest
which
were
presented
to
the
corn
mother
and
the
corn
maiden
at
eleusis
not
merely
by
every
husbandman
in
attica
but
by
all
the
allies
and
subjects
of
athens
far
and
near
and
even
by
many
free
greek
communities
beyond
the
sea
the
reason
why
year
by
year
these
offerings
of
grain
poured
from
far
countries
into
the
public
granaries
at
eleusis
was
the
widespread
belief
that
the
gift
of
corn
had
been
first
bestowed
by
demeter
on
the
athenians
and
afterwards
disseminated
by
them
among
all
mankind
through
the
agency
of
triptolemus
who
travelled
over
the
world
in
his
car
teaching
all
peoples
to
plough
the
earth
and
to
sow
the
seed
in
the
fifth
century
before
our
era
the
legend
was
celebrated
by
sophocles
in
a
play
called
in
which
he
represented
demeter
instructing
the
hero
to
carry
the
seed
of
the
fruits
which
she
had
bestowed
on
men
to
all
the
coasts
of
southern
italy
from
which
we
may
infer
that
the
cities
of
magna
graecia
were
among
the
number
of
those
that
sent
the
of
barley
and
wheat
every
year
to
athens
again
in
the
fourth
century
before
our
era
xenophon
represents
callias
the
braggart
eleusinian
torchbearer
addressing
the
lacedaemonians
in
a
set
speech
in
which
he
declared
that
our
ancestor
triptolemus
is
said
to
have
bestowed
the
seed
of
demeter
s
corn
on
the
peloponese
before
any
other
land
how
then
he
asked
with
pathetic
earnestness
can
it
be
right
that
you
should
come
to
ravage
the
corn
of
the
men
from
whom
you
received
the
seed
again
writing
in
the
fourth
century
before
our
era
isocrates
relates
with
a
swell
of
patriotic
pride
how
in
her
search
for
her
lost
daughter
persephone
the
goddess
demeter
came
to
attica
and
gave
to
the
ancestors
of
the
athenians
the
two
greatest
of
all
gifts
the
gift
of
the
corn
and
the
gift
of
the
mysteries
of
which
the
one
reclaimed
men
from
the
life
of
beasts
and
the
other
held
out
hopes
to
them
of
a
blissful
eternity
beyond
the
grave
the
antiquity
of
the
tradition
the
orator
proceeds
to
say
was
no
reason
for
rejecting
it
but
quite
the
contrary
it
furnished
a
strong
argument
in
its
favour
for
what
many
affirmed
and
all
had
heard
might
be
accepted
as
trustworthy
and
moreover
he
adds
we
are
not
driven
to
rest
our
case
merely
on
the
venerable
age
of
the
tradition
we
can
appeal
to
stronger
evidence
in
its
support
for
most
of
the
cities
send
us
every
year
the
of
the
corn
as
a
memorial
of
that
ancient
benefit
and
when
any
of
them
have
failed
to
do
so
the
pythian
priestess
has
commanded
them
to
send
the
due
portions
of
the
fruits
and
to
act
towards
our
city
according
to
ancestral
custom
can
anything
be
supported
by
stronger
evidence
than
by
the
oracle
of
god
the
assent
of
many
greeks
and
the
harmony
of
ancient
legend
with
the
deeds
of
this
testimony
of
isocrates
to
the
antiquity
both
of
the
legend
and
of
the
custom
might
perhaps
have
been
set
aside
or
at
least
disparaged
as
the
empty
bombast
of
a
wordy
rhetorician
if
it
had
not
happened
by
good
chance
to
be
amply
confirmed
by
an
official
decree
of
the
athenian
people
passed
in
the
century
before
isocrates
wrote
the
decree
was
found
inscribed
on
a
stone
at
eleusis
and
is
dated
by
scholars
in
the
latter
half
of
the
fifth
century
before
our
era
sometime
between
and
it
deals
with
the
of
barley
and
wheat
which
were
offered
to
the
two
goddesses
that
is
to
demeter
and
persephone
not
only
by
the
athenians
and
their
allies
but
by
the
greeks
in
general
it
prescribes
the
exact
amount
of
barley
and
wheat
which
was
to
be
offered
by
the
athenians
and
their
allies
and
it
directs
the
highest
officials
at
eleusis
namely
the
hierophant
and
the
torchbearer
to
exhort
the
other
greeks
at
the
mysteries
to
offer
likewise
of
the
of
the
corn
the
authority
alleged
in
the
decree
for
requiring
or
inviting
offerings
of
alike
from
athenians
and
from
foreigners
is
ancestral
custom
and
the
bidding
of
the
delphic
oracle
the
senate
is
further
enjoined
to
send
commissioners
so
far
as
it
could
be
done
to
all
greek
cities
whatsoever
exhorting
though
not
commanding
them
to
send

the

the
greeks
observed
of
sending
year
by
year
the
of
the
harvest
to
athens
in
gratitude
for
the
corn
but
he
speaks
of
the
practice
as
a
thing
of
the
past
we
may
suspect
that
the
tribute
of
corn
ceased
to
flow
from
far
countries
to
athens
when
with
her
falling
fortunes
and
decaying
empire
her
proud
galleys
had
ceased
to
carry
the
terror
of
the
athenian
arms
into
distant
seas
but
if
the
homage
was
no
longer
paid
in
the
substantial
shape
of
cargoes
of
grain
it
continued
down
to
the
latest
days
of
paganism
to
be
paid
in
the
cheaper
form
of
gratitude
for
that
inestimable
benefit
which
the
athenians
claimed
to
have
received
from
the
corn
goddess
and
to
have
liberally
communicated
to
the
rest
of
mankind
even
the
sicilians
who
inhabiting
a
fertile
island
worshipped
demeter
and
persephone
above
all
the
gods
and
claimed
to
have
been
the
first
to
receive
the
gift
of
the
corn
from
the
corn
goddess
nevertheless
freely
acknowledged
that
the
athenians
had
spread
though
they
had
not
originated
the
useful
discovery
among
the
nations
thus
the
patriotic
sicilian
historian
diodorus
while
giving
the
precedence
to
his
strives
to
be
just
to
the
athenian
pretensions
in
the
following
passage
mythologists
says
he
relate
that
demeter
unable
to
find
her
daughter
lit
torches
at
the
craters
of
etna
and
roamed
over
many
parts
of
the
world
those
people
who
received
her
best
she
rewarded
by
giving
them
in
return
the
fruit
of
the
wheat
and
because
the
athenians
welcomed
her
most
kindly
of
all
she
bestowed
the
fruit
of
the
wheat
on
them
next
after
the
sicilians
wherefore
that
people
honoured
the
goddess
more
than
any
other
folk
by
magnificent
sacrifices
and
the
mysteries
at
eleusis
which
for
their
extreme
antiquity
and
sanctity
have
become
famous
among
all
men
from
the
athenians
many
others
received
the
boon
of
the
corn
and
shared
the
seed
with
their
neighbours
till
they
filled
the
whole
inhabited
earth
with
it
but
as
the
people
of
sicily
on
account
of
the
intimate
relation
in
which
they
stood
to
demeter
and
the
maiden
were
the
first
to
participate
in
the
newly
discovered
corn
they
appointed
sacrifices
and
popular
festivities
in
honour
of
each
of
the
two
goddesses
naming
the
celebrations
after
them
and
signifying
the
nature
of
the
boons
they
had
received
by
the
dates
of
the
festivals
for
they
celebrated
the
bringing
home
of
the
maiden
at
the
time
when
the
corn
was
ripe
performing
the
sacrifice
and
holding
the
festivity
with
all
the
solemnity
and
zeal
that
might
be
reasonably
expected
of
men
who
desired
to
testify
their
gratitude
for
so
signal
a
gift
bestowed
on
them
before
all
the
rest
of
mankind
but
the
sacrifice
to
demeter
they
assigned
to
the
time
when
the
sowing
of
the
corn
begins
and
for
ten
days
they
hold
a
popular
festivity
which
bears
the
name
of
the
goddess
and
is
remarkable
as
well
for
the
magnificence
of
its
pomp
as
for
the
costumes
then
worn
in
imitation
of
the
olden
time
during
these
days
it
is
customary
for
people
to
rail
at
each
other
in
foul
language
because
when
demeter
was
mourning
for
the
rape
of
the
maiden
she
laughed
at
a
ribald
thus
despite
his
natural
prepossession
in
favour
of
his
native
land
diodorus
bears
testimony
both
to
the
special
blessing
bestowed
on
the
athenians
by
the
corn
goddess
and
to
the
generosity
with
which
they
had
imparted
the
blessing
to
others
until
it
gradually
spread
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
again
cicero
addressing
a
roman
audience
enumerates
among
the
benefits
which
athens
was
believed
to
have
conferred
on
the
world
the
gift
of
the
corn
and
its
origin
in
attic
soil
and
the
cursory
manner
in
which
he
alludes
to
it
seems
to
prove
that
the
tradition
was
familiar
to
his
hearers
four
centuries
later
the
rhetorician
himerius
speaks
of
demeter
s
gift
of
the
corn
and
the
mysteries
to
the
athenians
as
the
source
of
the
first
and
greatest
service
rendered
by
their
city
to
mankind
so
ancient
widespread
and
persistent
was
the
legend
which
ascribed
the
origin
of
the
corn
to
the
goddess
demeter
and
associated
it
with
the
institution
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
no
wonder
that
the
delphic
oracle
called
athens
the
metropolis
of
the
from
the
passage
of
diodorus
which
i
have
quoted
we
learn
that
the
sicilians
celebrated
the
festival
of
demeter
at
the
beginning
of
sowing
and
the
festival
of
persephone
at
harvest
this
proves
that
they
associated
if
they
did
not
identify
the
mother
goddess
with
the
and
the
daughter
goddess
with
the
ripe
ears
could
any
association
or
identification
be
more
easy
and
obvious
to
people
who
personified
the
processes
of
nature
under
the
form
of
anthropomorphic
deities
as
the
seed
brings
forth
the
ripe
ear
so
the
corn
mother
demeter
gave
birth
to
the
corn
daughter
persephone
it
is
true
that
difficulties
arise
when
we
attempt
to
analyse
this
seemingly
simple
conception
how
for
example
are
we
to
divide
exactly
the
two
persons
of
the
divinity
at
what
precise
moment
does
the
seed
cease
to
be
the
corn
mother
and
begins
to
burgeon
out
into
the
corn
daughter
and
how
far
can
we
identify
the
material
substance
of
the
barley
and
wheat
with
the
divine
bodies
of
the
two
goddesses
questions
of
this
sort
probably
gave
little
concern
to
the
sturdy
swains
who
ploughed
sowed
and
reaped
the
fat
fields
of
sicily
we
can
not
imagine
that
their
night
s
rest
was
disturbed
by
uneasy
meditations
on
these
knotty
problems
it
would
hardly
be
strange
if
the
muzzy
mind
of
the
sicilian
bumpkin
who
looked
with
blind
devotion
to
the
two
goddesses
for
his
daily
bread
totally
failed
to
distinguish
demeter
from
the
seed
and
persephone
from
the
ripe
sheaves
and
if
he
accepted
implicitly
the
doctrine
of
the
real
presence
of
the
divinities
in
the
corn
without
discriminating
too
curiously
between
the
material
and
the
spiritual
properties
of
the
barley
or
the
wheat
and
if
he
had
been
closely
questioned
by
a
rigid
logician
as
to
the
exact
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
the
two
persons
of
the
godhead
who
together
represented
for
him
the
annual
vicissitudes
of
the
cereals
hodge
might
have
scratched
his
head
and
confessed
that
it
puzzled
him
to
say
where
precisely
the
one
goddess
ended
and
the
other
began
or
why
the
seed
buried
in
the
ground
should
figure
at
one
time
as
the
dead
daughter
persephone
descending
into
the
nether
world
and
at
another
as
the
living
mother
demeter
about
to
give
birth
to
next
year
s
crop
theological
subtleties
like
these
have
posed
longer
heads
than
are
commonly
to
be
found
on
bucolic
shoulders
the
time
of
year
at
which
the
were
offered
to
demeter
and
persephone
at
eleusis
is
not
explicitly
mentioned
by
ancient
authorities
and
accordingly
no
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
date
of
the
offering
as
to
its
religious
significance
it
is
true
that
at
the
eleusinian
mysteries
the
hierophant
and
torchbearer
publicly
exhorted
the
greeks
in
general
as
distinguished
from
the
athenians
and
their
allies
to
offer
the
in
accordance
with
ancestral
custom
and
the
bidding
of
the
delphic
oracle
but
there
is
nothing
to
shew
that
the
offerings
were
made
immediately
after
the
exhortation
nor
does
any
ancient
authority
support
the
view
of
a
modern
scholar
that
the
offering
of
the
or
a
portion
of
them
took
place
at
the
festival
before
ploughing
though
that
festival
would
no
doubt
be
an
eminently
appropriate
occasion
for
propitiating
with
such
offerings
the
goddess
on
whose
bounty
the
next
year
s
crop
was
believed
to
depend
on
the
other
hand
we
are
positively
told
that
the
were
carried
to
eleusis
to
be
used
at
the
festival
of
the
but
the
statement
cursorily
reported
by
writers
of
no
very
high
authority
can
not
be
implicitly
relied
upon
and
even
if
it
could
we
should
hardly
be
justified
in
inferring
from
it
that
all
the
of
the
corn
were
offered
to
demeter
and
persephone
at
this
festival
be
that
as
it
may
the
festival
of
the
was
intimately
connected
with
the
worship
both
of
demeter
and
of
dionysus
and
accordingly
it
deserves
our
attention
it
is
said
to
have
been
sacred
to
both
these
deities
and
while
the
name
seems
to
connect
it
rather
with
the
corn
goddess
than
with
the
wine
god
we
are
yet
informed
that
it
was
held
by
the
athenians
on
the
occasion
of
the
pruning
of
the
vines
and
the
tasting
of
the
wine
the
festival
is
frequently
mentioned
in
eleusinian
inscriptions
from
some
of
which
we
gather
that
it
included
sacrifices
to
the
two
goddesses
and
a
ancestral
contest
as
to
the
nature
of
which
we
have
no
information
we
may
suppose
that
the
festival
or
some
part
of
it
was
celebrated
on
the
sacred
of
triptolemus
at
eleusis
for
as
triptolemus
was
the
hero
who
is
said
to
have
diffused
the
knowledge
of
the
corn
all
over
the
world
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
the
festival
of
the
should
be
held
on
the
sacred
which
bore
his
name
as
for
demeter
we
have
already
seen
how
intimate
was
her
association
with
the
and
the
operation
of
threshing
according
to
homer
she
is
the
yellow
goddess
who
parts
the
yellow
grain
from
the
white
chaff
at
the
threshing
and
in
cos
her
image
with
the
and
the
poppies
in
her
hands
stood
on
the
the
festival
lasted
one
day
and
no
victims
might
be
sacrificed
at
it
but
special
use
was
made
as
we
have
seen
of
the
of
the
corn
with
regard
to
the
dating
of
the
festival
we
are
informed
that
it
fell
in
the
month
poseideon
which
corresponds
roughly
to
our
december
and
as
the
date
rests
on
the
high
authority
of
the
ancient
athenian
antiquary
philochorus
and
is
moreover
indirectly
confirmed
by
inscriptional
evidence
we
are
bound
to
accept
it
but
it
is
certainly
surprising
to
find
a
festival
of
the
held
so
late
in
the
year
long
after
the
threshing
which
in
greece
usually
takes
place
not
later
than
midsummer
though
on
high
ground
in
crete
it
is
sometimes
prolonged
till
near
the
end
of
august
we
seem
bound
to
conclude
that
the
festival
of
the
was
quite
distinct
from
the
actual
threshing
of
the
corn
it
is
said
to
have
included
certain
mystic
rites
performed
by
women
alone
who
feasted
and
quaffed
wine
while
they
broke
filthy
jests
on
each
other
and
exhibited
cakes
baked
in
the
form
of
the
male
and
female
organs
of
generation
if
the
latter
particulars
are
correctly
reported
we
may
suppose
that
these
indecencies
like
certain
obscenities
which
seem
to
have
formed
part
of
the
great
mysteries
at
eleusis
were
no
mere
wanton
outbursts
of
licentious
passion
but
were
deliberately
practised
as
rites
calculated
to
promote
the
fertility
of
the
ground
by
means
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
a
like
association
of
what
we
might
call
indecency
with
rites
intended
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
meets
us
in
the
thesmophoria
a
festival
of
demeter
celebrated
by
women
alone
at
which
the
character
of
the
goddess
as
a
source
of
fertility
comes
out
clearly
in
the
custom
of
mixing
the
remains
of
the
sacrificial
pigs
with
the
in
order
to
obtain
a
plentiful
crop
we
shall
return
to
this
festival
later
on
other
festivals
held
at
eleusis
in
honour
of
demeter
and
persephone
were
known
as
the
green
festival
and
the
festival
of
the
cornstalks
of
the
manner
of
their
celebration
we
know
nothing
except
that
they
comprised
sacrifices
which
were
offered
to
demeter
and
persephone
but
their
names
suffice
to
connect
the
two
festivals
with
the
green
and
the
standing
corn
we
have
seen
that
demeter
herself
bore
the
title
of
green
and
that
sacrifices
were
offered
to
her
under
that
title
which
plainly
aimed
at
promoting
fertility
among
the
many
epithets
applied
to
demeter
which
mark
her
relation
to
the
corn
may
further
be
mentioned
she
of
the
corn
she
of
the
she
of
the
nurse
of
the
crowned
with
ears
of
corn
she
of
the
seed
she
of
the
green
fruits
heavy
with
summer
fruits
she
of
the
great
loaf
and
she
of
the
great
barley
of
these
epithets
it
may
be
remarked
that
though
all
of
them
are
quite
appropriate
to
a
corn
goddess
some
of
them
would
scarcely
be
applicable
to
an
earth
goddess
and
therefore
they
add
weight
to
the
other
arguments
which
turn
the
scale
in
favour
of
the
corn
as
the
fundamental
attribute
of
demeter
how
deeply
implanted
in
the
mind
of
the
ancient
greeks
was
this
faith
in
demeter
as
goddess
of
the
corn
may
be
judged
by
the
circumstance
that
the
faith
actually
persisted
among
their
christian
descendants
at
her
old
sanctuary
of
eleusis
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
when
the
english
traveller
dodwell
revisited
eleusis
the
inhabitants
lamented
to
him
the
loss
of
a
colossal
image
of
demeter
which
was
carried
off
by
clarke
in
and
presented
to
the
university
of
cambridge
where
it
still
remains
in
my
first
journey
to
greece
says
dodwell
this
protecting
deity
was
in
its
full
glory
situated
in
the
centre
of
a
amongst
the
ruins
of
her
temple
the
villagers
were
impressed
with
a
persuasion
that
their
rich
harvests
were
the
effect
of
her
bounty
and
since
her
removal
their
abundance
as
they
assured
me
has
thus
we
see
the
corn
goddess
demeter
standing
on
the
of
eleusis
and
dispensing
corn
to
her
worshippers
in
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
christian
era
precisely
as
her
image
stood
and
dispensed
corn
to
her
worshippers
on
the
of
cos
in
the
days
of
theocritus
and
just
as
the
people
of
eleusis
last
century
attributed
the
diminution
of
their
harvests
to
the
loss
of
the
image
of
demeter
so
in
antiquity
the
sicilians
a
people
devoted
to
the
worship
of
the
two
corn
goddesses
lamented
that
the
crops
of
many
towns
had
perished
because
the
unscrupulous
roman
governor
verres
had
impiously
carried
off
the
image
of
demeter
from
her
famous
temple
at
henna
could
we
ask
for
a
clearer
proof
that
demeter
was
indeed
the
goddess
of
the
corn
than
this
belief
held
by
the
greeks
down
to
modern
times
that
the
depended
on
her
presence
and
bounty
and
perished
when
her
image
was
removed
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
i
followed
an
eminent
french
scholar
in
concluding
from
various
indications
that
part
of
the
religious
drama
performed
in
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
may
have
been
a
marriage
between
the
zeus
and
the
demeter
represented
by
the
hierophant
and
the
priestess
of
the
goddess
respectively
the
conclusion
is
arrived
at
by
combining
a
number
of
passages
all
more
or
less
vague
and
indefinite
of
late
christian
writers
hence
it
must
remain
to
some
extent
uncertain
and
can
not
at
the
best
lay
claim
to
more
than
a
fair
degree
of
probability
it
may
be
as
professor
ridgeway
holds
that
this
dramatic
marriage
of
the
god
and
goddess
was
an
innovation
foisted
into
the
eleusinian
mysteries
in
that
great
welter
of
religions
which
followed
the
meeting
of
the
east
and
the
west
in
the
later
ages
of
antiquity
if
a
marriage
of
zeus
and
demeter
did
indeed
form
an
important
feature
of
the
mysteries
in
the
fifth
century
before
our
era
it
is
certainly
remarkable
as
professor
ridgeway
has
justly
pointed
out
that
no
mention
of
zeus
occurs
in
the
public
decree
of
that
century
which
regulates
the
offerings
of
and
the
sacrifices
to
be
made
to
the
gods
and
goddesses
of
eleusis
at
the
same
time
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
if
the
evidence
for
the
ritual
marriage
of
zeus
and
demeter
is
late
and
doubtful
the
evidence
for
the
myth
is
ancient
and
indubitable
the
story
was
known
to
homer
for
in
the
list
of
beauties
to
whom
he
makes
zeus
in
a
burst
of
candour
confess
that
he
had
lost
his
too
susceptible
heart
there
occurs
the
name
of
the
queen
demeter
and
in
another
passage
the
poet
represents
the
jealous
god
smiting
with
a
thunderbolt
the
favoured
lover
with
whom
the
goddess
had
forgotten
her
dignity
among
the
furrows
of
a
fallow
field
moreover
according
to
one
tradition
dionysus
himself
was
the
offspring
of
the
intrigue
between
zeus
and
demeter
thus
there
is
no
intrinsic
improbability
in
the
view
that
one
or
other
of
these
unedifying
incidents
in
the
backstairs
chronicle
of
olympus
should
have
formed
part
of
the
sacred
in
the
eleusinian
mysteries
but
it
seems
just
possible
that
the
marriage
to
which
the
christian
writers
allude
with
malicious
joy
may
after
all
have
been
of
a
more
regular
and
orthodox
pattern
we
are
positively
told
that
the
rape
of
persephone
was
acted
at
the
mysteries
may
that
scene
not
have
been
followed
by
another
representing
the
solemnisation
of
her
nuptials
with
her
ravisher
and
husband
pluto
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
pluto
was
sometimes
known
as
a
god
of
fertility
under
the
title
of
subterranean
zeus
it
was
to
him
under
that
title
as
well
as
to
demeter
that
the
greek
ploughman
prayed
at
the
beginning
of
the
ploughing
and
the
people
of
myconus
used
to
sacrifice
to
subterranean
zeus
and
subterranean
earth
for
the
prosperity
of
the
crops
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
month
lenaeon
thus
it
may
be
that
the
zeus
whose
marriage
was
dramatically
represented
at
the
mysteries
was
not
the
zeus
but
his
brother
zeus
of
the
underworld
and
that
the
writers
who
refer
to
the
ceremony
have
confused
the
two
brothers
this
view
if
it
could
be
established
would
dispose
of
the
difficulty
raised
by
the
absence
of
the
name
of
zeus
in
the
decree
which
prescribes
the
offerings
to
be
made
to
the
gods
of
eleusis
for
although
in
that
decree
pluto
is
not
mentioned
under
the
name
of
subterranean
zeus
he
is
clearly
referred
to
as
the
editors
of
the
inscription
have
seen
under
the
vague
title
of
the
god
while
his
consort
persephone
is
similarly
referred
to
under
the
title
of
the
goddess
and
it
is
ordained
that
perfect
victims
shall
be
sacrificed
to
both
of
them
however
if
we
thus
dispose
of
one
difficulty
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
doing
so
we
raise
another
for
if
the
bridegroom
in
the
sacred
marriage
at
eleusis
was
not
the
zeus
but
the
pluto
we
seem
driven
to
suppose
that
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
reverend
christian
the
bride
was
his
lawful
wife
persephone
and
not
his
sister
and
demeter
in
short
on
the
hypothesis
which
i
have
suggested
we
are
compelled
to
conclude
that
the
ancient
busybodies
who
lifted
the
veil
from
the
mystic
marriage
were
mistaken
as
to
the
person
both
of
the
divine
bridegroom
and
of
the
divine
bride
in
regard
to
the
bridegroom
i
have
conjectured
that
they
may
have
confused
the
two
brothers
zeus
of
the
upper
world
and
zeus
of
the
lower
world
in
regard
to
the
bride
can
any
reason
be
suggested
for
confounding
the
persons
of
the
mother
and
daughter
on
the
view
here
taken
of
the
nature
of
demeter
and
persephone
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
confuse
them
with
each
other
for
both
of
them
were
mythical
embodiments
of
the
corn
the
mother
demeter
standing
for
the
old
corn
of
last
year
and
the
daughter
persephone
standing
for
the
new
corn
of
this
year
in
point
of
fact
greek
artists
both
of
the
archaic
and
of
later
periods
frequently
represent
the
mother
and
daughter
side
by
side
in
forms
which
resemble
each
other
so
closely
that
eminent
modern
experts
have
sometimes
differed
from
each
other
on
the
question
which
is
demeter
and
which
is
persephone
indeed
in
some
cases
it
might
be
quite
impossible
to
distinguish
the
two
if
it
were
not
for
the
inscriptions
attached
to
the
figures
the
ancient
sculptors
and
engravers
must
have
had
some
good
reason
for
portraying
the
two
goddesses
in
types
which
are
almost
indistinguishable
from
each
other
and
what
better
reason
could
they
have
had
than
the
knowledge
that
the
two
persons
of
the
godhead
were
one
in
substance
that
they
stood
merely
for
two
different
aspects
of
the
same
simple
natural
phenomenon
the
growth
of
the
corn
thus
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
demeter
and
persephone
may
have
been
confused
in
ritual
as
well
as
in
art
why
in
particular
the
part
of
the
divine
bride
in
a
sacred
marriage
may
sometimes
have
been
assigned
to
the
mother
and
sometimes
to
the
daughter
but
all
this
i
fully
admit
is
a
mere
speculation
and
i
only
put
it
forward
as
such
we
possess
far
too
little
information
as
to
a
sacred
marriage
in
the
eleusinian
mysteries
to
be
justified
in
speaking
with
confidence
on
so
obscure
a
subject
one
thing
however
which
we
may
say
with
a
fair
degree
of
probability
is
that
if
such
a
marriage
did
take
place
at
eleusis
no
date
in
the
agricultural
year
could
well
have
been
more
appropriate
for
it
than
the
date
at
which
the
mysteries
actually
fell
namely
about
the
middle
of
september
the
long
greek
summer
is
practically
rainless
and
in
the
fervent
heat
and
unbroken
drought
all
nature
languishes
the
are
dry
the
fields
parched
the
farmer
awaits
impatiently
the
of
the
autumnal
rains
which
begin
in
october
and
mark
the
great
season
for
ploughing
and
sowing
what
time
could
be
fitter
for
celebrating
the
union
of
the
corn
goddess
with
her
husband
the
earth
god
or
perhaps
rather
with
her
paramour
the
sky
god
who
will
soon
descend
in
fertilising
showers
to
quicken
the
seed
in
the
furrows
such
embraces
of
the
divine
powers
or
their
human
representatives
might
well
be
deemed
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
indispensable
to
the
growth
of
the
crops
at
least
similar
ideas
have
been
entertained
and
similar
customs
have
been
practised
by
many
peoples
and
in
the
legend
of
demeter
s
among
the
furrows
of
the
fallow
we
seem
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
rude
rites
of
the
same
sort
performed
in
the
fields
at
by
greek
ploughmen
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
the
growth
of
the
seed
which
they
were
about
to
commit
to
the
bosom
of
the
naked
earth
in
this
connexion
a
statement
of
ancient
writers
as
to
the
rites
of
eleusis
receives
fresh
significance
we
are
told
that
at
these
rites
the
worshippers
looked
up
to
the
sky
and
cried
rain
and
then
looked
down
at
the
earth
and
cried
conceive
nothing
could
be
more
appropriate
at
a
marriage
of
the
sky
god
and
the
earth
or
corn
goddess
than
such
invocations
to
the
heaven
to
pour
down
rain
and
to
the
earth
or
the
corn
to
conceive
seed
under
the
fertilising
shower
in
greece
no
time
could
well
be
more
suitable
for
the
utterance
of
such
prayers
than
just
at
the
date
when
the
great
mysteries
of
eleusis
were
celebrated
at
the
end
of
the
long
drought
of
summer
and
before
the
first
rains
of
autumn
different
both
from
the
great
mysteries
and
the
offerings
of
at
eleusis
were
the
games
which
were
celebrated
there
on
a
great
scale
once
in
every
four
years
and
on
a
less
scale
once
in
every
two
years
that
the
games
were
distinct
from
the
mysteries
is
proved
by
their
periods
which
were
quadriennial
and
biennial
respectively
whereas
the
mysteries
were
celebrated
annually
moreover
in
greek
epigraphy
our
most
authentic
evidence
in
such
matters
the
games
and
the
mysteries
are
clearly
distinguished
from
each
other
by
being
mentioned
separately
in
the
same
inscription
but
like
the
mysteries
the
games
seem
to
have
been
very
ancient
for
the
parian
chronicler
who
wrote
in
the
year
assigns
the
foundation
of
the
eleusinian
games
to
the
reign
of
pandion
the
son
of
cecrops
however
he
represents
them
as
of
later
origin
than
the
eleusinian
mysteries
which
according
to
him
were
instituted
by
eumolpus
in
the
reign
of
erechtheus
after
demeter
had
planted
corn
in
attica
and
triptolemus
had
sown
seed
in
the
rarian
plain
at
eleusis
this
testimony
to
the
superior
antiquity
of
the
mysteries
is
in
harmony
with
our
most
ancient
authority
on
the
rites
of
eleusis
the
author
of
the
to
who
describes
the
origin
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
but
makes
no
reference
or
allusion
to
the
eleusinian
games
however
the
great
age
of
the
games
is
again
vouched
for
at
a
much
later
date
by
the
rhetorician
aristides
who
even
declares
that
they
were
the
oldest
of
all
greek
games
with
regard
to
the
nature
and
meaning
of
the
games
our
information
is
extremely
scanty
but
an
old
scholiast
on
pindar
tells
us
that
they
were
celebrated
in
honour
of
demeter
and
persephone
as
a
at
the
conclusion
of
the
his
testimony
is
confirmed
by
that
of
the
rhetorician
aristides
who
mentions
the
institution
of
the
eleusinian
games
in
immediate
connexion
with
the
offerings
of
the
of
the
corn
which
many
greek
states
sent
to
athens
and
from
an
inscription
dated
about
the
close
of
the
third
century
before
our
era
we
learn
that
at
the
great
eleusinian
games
sacrifices
were
offered
to
demeter
and
persephone
further
we
gather
from
an
official
athenian
inscription
of
that
both
the
great
and
the
lesser
games
included
athletic
and
musical
contests
a
and
a
competition
which
bore
the
name
of
the
ancestral
or
hereditary
contest
and
which
accordingly
may
well
have
formed
the
original
kernel
of
the
games
unfortunately
nothing
is
known
about
this
ancestral
contest
we
might
be
tempted
to
identify
it
with
the
ancestral
contest
included
in
the
eleusinian
festival
of
the
which
was
probably
held
on
the
sacred
of
triptolemus
at
eleusis
if
the
identification
could
be
proved
we
should
have
another
confirmation
of
the
tradition
which
connects
the
games
with
demeter
and
the
corn
for
according
to
the
prevalent
tradition
it
was
to
triptolemus
that
demeter
first
revealed
the
secret
of
the
corn
and
it
was
he
whom
she
sent
out
as
an
itinerant
missionary
to
impart
the
beneficent
discovery
of
the
cereals
to
all
mankind
and
to
teach
them
to
sow
the
seed
on
monuments
of
art
especially
in
he
is
constantly
represented
along
with
demeter
in
this
capacity
holding
in
his
hand
and
sitting
in
his
car
which
is
sometimes
winged
and
sometimes
drawn
by
dragons
and
from
which
he
is
said
to
have
sowed
the
seed
down
on
the
whole
world
as
he
sped
through
the
air
at
eleusis
victims
bought
with
the
of
the
wheat
and
barley
were
sacrificed
to
him
as
well
as
to
demeter
and
persephone
in
short
if
we
may
judge
from
the
combined
testimony
of
greek
literature
and
art
triptolemus
was
the
first
and
foremost
even
beyond
the
limits
of
the
greek
world
all
men
we
are
told
founded
sanctuaries
and
erected
altars
in
his
honour
because
he
had
bestowed
on
them
the
gift
of
the
corn
his
very
name
has
been
plausibly
explained
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
as
with
reference
to
the
greek
custom
of
ploughing
the
land
thrice
a
year
and
the
derivation
is
said
to
be
on
philological
principles
free
from
objection
in
fact
it
would
seem
as
if
triptolemus
like
demeter
and
persephone
themselves
were
a
purely
mythical
being
an
embodiment
of
the
conception
of
the
first
sower
at
all
events
in
the
local
eleusinian
legend
according
to
an
eminent
scholar
who
has
paid
special
attention
to
attic
genealogy
triptolemus
does
not
like
his
comrade
eumolpus
or
other
founders
of
eleusinian
priestly
families
continue
his
kind
but
without
leaving
offspring
who
might
perpetuate
his
priestly
office
he
is
removed
from
the
scene
of
his
beneficent
activity
as
he
appeared
so
he
vanishes
again
from
the
legend
after
he
has
fulfilled
his
divine
however
there
is
no
sufficient
ground
for
identifying
the
ancestral
contest
of
the
eleusinian
games
with
the
ancestral
contest
of
the
at
eleusis
and
accordingly
the
connexion
of
the
games
with
the
and
with
the
triptolemus
must
so
far
remain
uncertain
but
a
clear
trace
of
such
a
connexion
may
be
seen
in
the
custom
of
rewarding
the
victors
in
the
eleusinian
games
with
measures
of
barley
in
the
official
athenian
inscription
of
which
contains
the
accounts
of
the
superintendents
of
eleusis
and
the
treasurers
of
the
two
goddesses
the
amounts
of
corn
handed
over
by
these
officers
to
the
priests
and
priestesses
for
the
purposes
of
the
games
is
exactly
specified
this
of
itself
is
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
eleusinian
games
were
closely
connected
with
the
worship
of
demeter
and
persephone
the
grain
thus
distributed
in
prizes
was
probably
reaped
on
the
rarian
plain
near
eleusis
where
according
to
the
legend
triptolemus
sowed
the
first
corn
certainly
we
know
that
the
barley
grown
on
that
plain
was
used
in
sacrifices
and
for
the
baking
of
the
sacrificial
cakes
from
which
we
may
reasonably
infer
that
the
prizes
of
barley
to
which
no
doubt
a
certain
sanctity
attached
in
the
popular
mind
were
brought
from
the
same
holy
fields
so
sacred
was
the
rarian
plain
that
no
dead
body
was
allowed
to
defile
it
when
such
a
pollution
accidentally
took
place
it
was
expiated
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
pig
the
usual
victim
employed
in
greek
purificatory
rites
thus
so
far
as
the
scanty
evidence
at
our
disposal
permits
us
to
judge
the
eleusinian
games
like
the
eleusinian
mysteries
would
seem
to
have
been
primarily
concerned
with
demeter
and
persephone
as
goddesses
of
the
corn
at
least
that
is
expressly
affirmed
by
the
old
scholiast
on
pindar
and
it
is
borne
out
by
the
practice
of
rewarding
the
victors
with
measures
of
barley
perhaps
the
ancestral
contest
which
may
well
have
formed
the
original
nucleus
of
the
games
was
a
contest
between
the
reapers
on
the
sacred
rarian
plain
to
see
who
should
finish
his
allotted
task
before
his
fellows
for
success
in
such
a
contest
no
prize
could
be
more
appropriate
than
a
measure
of
the
sacred
barley
which
the
victorious
reaper
had
just
cut
on
the
in
the
sequel
we
shall
see
that
similar
contests
between
reapers
have
been
common
on
the
harvest
fields
of
modern
europe
and
it
will
appear
that
such
competitions
are
not
purely
athletic
their
aim
is
not
simply
to
demonstrate
the
superior
strength
activity
and
skill
of
the
victors
it
is
to
secure
for
the
particular
farm
the
possession
of
the
blooming
young
of
the
present
year
conceived
as
the
embodiment
of
the
vigorous
grain
and
to
pass
on
to
laggard
neighbours
the
aged
of
the
past
year
conceived
as
an
embodiment
of
the
effete
and
outworn
energies
of
the
corn
may
it
not
have
been
so
at
eleusis
may
not
the
reapers
have
vied
with
each
other
for
possession
of
the
young
persephone
and
for
avoidance
of
the
old
demeter
may
not
the
prize
of
barley
which
rewarded
the
victor
in
the
ancestral
contest
have
been
supposed
to
house
in
the
ripe
ears
no
less
a
personage
than
the
persephone
herself
and
if
there
is
any
truth
in
these
conjectures
for
conjectures
they
are
and
nothing
more
we
may
hazard
a
guess
as
to
the
other
ancestral
contest
which
took
place
at
the
eleusinian
festival
of
the
perhaps
it
in
like
manner
was
originally
a
competition
between
threshers
on
the
sacred
of
triptolemus
to
determine
who
should
finish
threshing
his
allotted
quantity
of
corn
before
the
rest
such
competitions
have
also
been
common
as
we
shall
see
presently
on
the
of
modern
europe
and
their
motive
again
has
not
been
simple
emulation
between
sturdy
swains
for
the
reward
of
strength
and
dexterity
it
has
been
a
dread
of
being
burdened
with
the
aged
and
outworn
spirit
of
the
corn
conceived
as
present
in
the
bundle
of
which
receives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
we
know
that
effigies
of
demeter
with
corn
and
poppies
in
her
hands
stood
on
greek
perhaps
at
the
conclusion
of
the
threshing
these
effigies
as
representatives
of
the
old
were
passed
on
to
neighbours
who
had
not
yet
finished
threshing
the
corn
at
least
the
supposition
is
in
harmony
with
modern
customs
observed
on
the
it
is
possible
that
the
eleusinian
games
were
no
more
than
a
popular
merrymaking
celebrated
at
the
close
of
the
harvest
this
view
of
their
character
might
be
supported
by
modern
analogies
for
in
some
parts
of
germany
it
has
been
customary
for
the
harvesters
when
their
work
is
done
to
engage
in
athletic
competitions
of
various
kinds
which
have
at
first
sight
no
very
obvious
connexion
with
the
business
of
harvesting
for
example
at
besbau
near
luckau
great
cakes
were
baked
at
the
and
the
labourers
both
men
and
women
ran
races
for
them
he
or
she
who
reached
them
first
received
not
only
a
cake
but
a
handkerchief
or
the
like
as
a
prize
again
at
bergkirchen
when
the
harvest
was
over
a
garland
was
hung
up
and
the
harvesters
rode
at
it
on
horseback
and
tried
to
bring
it
down
with
a
stab
or
a
blow
as
they
galloped
past
he
who
succeeded
in
bringing
it
down
was
proclaimed
king
again
in
the
villages
near
fürstenwald
at
harvest
the
young
men
used
to
fetch
a
from
the
wood
peel
the
trunk
and
set
it
up
like
a
mast
in
the
middle
of
the
village
a
handkerchief
and
other
prizes
were
fastened
to
the
top
of
the
pole
and
the
men
clambered
up
for
them
among
the
peasantry
of
silesia
we
are
told
the
broadened
out
into
a
popular
festival
in
which
athletic
sports
figured
prominently
thus
for
example
at
järischau
in
the
strehlitz
district
a
scythe
a
rake
a
flail
and
a
or
pitchfork
were
fastened
to
the
top
of
a
smooth
pole
and
awarded
as
prizes
in
order
of
merit
to
the
men
who
displayed
most
agility
in
climbing
the
pole
younger
men
amused
themselves
with
running
in
sacks
high
jumps
and
so
forth
at
prauss
near
nimptsch
the
girls
ran
a
race
in
a
field
for
aprons
as
prizes
in
the
central
parts
of
silesia
a
favourite
amusement
at
harvest
was
a
race
between
girls
for
a
garland
of
leaves
or
flowers
yet
it
seems
probable
that
all
such
sports
at
harvest
were
in
origin
not
mere
pastimes
but
that
they
were
serious
attempts
to
secure
in
one
way
or
another
the
help
and
blessing
of
the
thus
in
some
parts
of
prussia
at
the
close
of
the
a
few
sheaves
used
to
be
left
standing
in
the
field
after
all
the
rest
of
the
rye
had
been
carted
home
these
sheaves
were
then
made
up
into
the
shape
of
a
man
and
dressed
out
in
masculine
costume
and
all
the
young
women
were
obliged
to
run
a
race
of
which
the
was
the
goal
she
who
won
the
race
led
off
the
dancing
in
the
evening
here
the
aim
of
the
among
the
young
women
is
clearly
to
secure
the
embodied
in
the
last
sheaf
left
standing
on
the
field
for
as
we
shall
see
later
on
the
last
sheaf
is
commonly
supposed
to
harbour
the
and
is
treated
accordingly
like
a
man
or
a
woman
if
the
ancestral
contest
at
the
eleusinian
games
was
as
i
have
conjectured
a
contest
between
the
reapers
on
the
sacred
we
should
have
to
suppose
that
the
games
were
celebrated
at
which
in
the
lowlands
of
greece
falls
in
may
or
even
at
the
end
of
april
this
theory
is
in
harmony
with
the
evidence
of
the
scholiast
on
pindar
who
tells
us
that
the
eleusinian
games
were
celebrated
after
the
no
other
ancient
authority
so
far
as
i
am
aware
mentions
at
what
time
of
the
year
these
games
were
held
modern
authorities
arguing
from
certain
slight
and
to
some
extent
conjectural
data
have
variously
assigned
them
to
metageitnion
august
and
to
boedromion
september
and
those
who
assign
them
to
boedromion
september
are
divided
in
opinion
as
to
whether
they
preceded
or
followed
the
mysteries
however
the
evidence
is
far
too
slender
and
uncertain
to
allow
of
any
conclusions
being
based
on
it
but
there
is
a
serious
difficulty
in
the
way
of
connecting
the
eleusinian
games
with
the
goddesses
of
the
corn
how
is
the
quadriennial
or
the
biennial
period
of
the
games
to
be
reconciled
with
the
annual
growth
of
the
crops
year
by
year
the
barley
and
the
wheat
are
sown
and
reaped
how
then
could
the
games
held
only
every
fourth
or
every
second
year
have
been
regarded
as
for
the
annual
harvest
on
this
view
of
their
nature
which
is
the
one
taken
by
the
old
scholiast
on
pindar
though
the
harvest
was
received
at
the
hands
of
the
corn
goddess
punctually
every
year
men
thanked
her
for
her
bounty
only
every
second
year
or
even
only
every
fourth
year
what
were
her
feelings
likely
to
be
in
the
blank
years
when
she
got
no
thanks
and
no
games
she
might
naturally
resent
such
negligence
and
ingratitude
and
punish
them
by
forbidding
the
seed
to
sprout
just
as
she
did
at
eleusis
when
she
mourned
the
loss
of
her
daughter
in
short
men
could
hardly
expect
to
reap
crops
in
years
in
which
they
offered
nothing
to
the
corn
goddess
that
would
indeed
appear
to
be
the
view
generally
taken
by
the
ancient
greeks
for
we
have
seen
that
year
by
year
they
presented
the
of
the
barley
and
the
wheat
to
demeter
not
merely
in
the
solemn
state
ritual
of
eleusis
but
also
in
rustic
festivals
held
by
farmers
on
their
the
pious
greek
husbandman
would
no
doubt
have
been
shocked
and
horrified
at
a
proposal
to
pay
the
corn
goddess
her
dues
only
every
second
or
fourth
year
no
offerings
no
crops
he
would
say
to
himself
and
would
anticipate
nothing
but
dearth
and
famine
in
any
year
when
he
failed
to
satisfy
the
just
and
lawful
demands
of
the
divinity
on
whose
good
pleasure
he
believed
the
growth
of
the
corn
to
be
directly
dependent
accordingly
we
may
regard
it
as
highly
probable
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
settled
and
regular
agriculture
in
greece
men
annually
propitiated
the
deities
of
the
corn
with
a
ritual
of
some
sort
and
rendered
them
their
dues
in
the
shape
of
offerings
of
the
ripe
barley
and
wheat
now
we
know
that
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
were
celebrated
every
year
and
accordingly
if
i
am
right
in
interpreting
them
as
essentially
a
dramatic
representation
of
the
annual
vicissitudes
of
the
corn
performed
for
the
purpose
of
quickening
the
seed
it
becomes
probable
that
in
some
form
or
another
they
were
annually
held
at
eleusis
long
before
the
practice
arose
of
celebrating
games
there
every
fourth
or
every
second
year
in
short
the
eleusinian
mysteries
were
in
all
probability
far
older
than
the
eleusinian
games
how
old
they
were
we
can
not
even
guess
but
when
we
consider
that
the
cultivation
of
barley
and
wheat
the
two
cereals
specially
associated
with
demeter
appears
to
have
been
practised
in
prehistoric
europe
from
the
stone
age
onwards
we
shall
be
disposed
to
admit
that
the
annual
performance
of
religious
or
magical
rites
at
eleusis
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
good
crops
whether
by
propitiating
the
corn
goddess
with
offerings
of
or
by
dramatically
representing
the
sowing
and
the
growth
of
the
corn
in
mythical
form
probably
dates
from
an
extremely
remote
antiquity
but
in
order
to
clear
our
ideas
on
this
subject
it
is
desirable
to
ascertain
if
possible
the
reason
for
holding
the
eleusinian
games
at
intervals
of
two
or
four
years
the
reason
for
holding
a
harvest
festival
and
thanksgiving
every
year
is
obvious
enough
but
why
hold
games
only
every
second
or
every
fourth
year
the
reason
for
such
limitations
is
by
no
means
obvious
on
the
face
of
them
especially
if
the
growth
of
the
crops
is
deemed
dependent
on
the
celebration
in
order
to
find
an
answer
to
this
question
it
may
be
well
at
the
outset
to
confine
our
attention
to
the
great
eleusinian
games
which
were
celebrated
only
every
fourth
year
that
these
were
the
principal
games
appears
not
only
from
their
name
but
from
the
testimony
of
aristotle
or
at
least
of
the
author
of
constitution
of
who
notices
only
the
quadriennial
or
as
in
accordance
with
greek
idiom
he
calls
it
the
penteteric
celebration
of
the
games
now
the
custom
of
holding
games
at
intervals
of
four
years
was
very
common
in
greece
to
take
only
a
few
conspicuous
examples
the
olympic
games
at
olympia
the
pythian
games
at
delphi
the
panathenaic
games
at
athens
and
the
eleutherian
games
at
plataea
were
all
celebrated
at
quadriennial
or
as
the
greeks
called
them
penteteric
periods
and
at
a
later
time
when
augustus
instituted
or
rather
renewed
on
a
more
splendid
scale
the
games
at
actium
to
commemorate
his
great
victory
he
followed
a
greek
precedent
by
ordaining
that
they
should
be
quadriennial
still
later
the
emperor
hadrian
instituted
quadriennial
games
at
mantinea
in
honour
of
his
dead
favourite
antinous
but
in
regard
to
the
two
greatest
of
all
the
greek
games
the
olympian
and
the
pythian
i
have
shewn
reasons
for
thinking
that
they
were
originally
celebrated
at
intervals
of
eight
instead
of
four
years
certainly
this
is
attested
for
the
pythian
games
and
the
mode
of
calculating
the
olympiads
by
alternate
periods
of
fifty
and
lunar
months
which
added
together
make
up
eight
solar
years
seems
to
prove
that
the
olympic
cycle
of
four
years
was
really
based
on
a
cycle
of
eight
years
from
which
it
is
natural
to
infer
that
in
the
beginning
the
olympic
like
the
pythian
games
may
have
been
octennial
instead
of
quadriennial
now
we
know
from
the
testimony
of
the
ancients
themselves
that
the
greeks
instituted
the
cycle
for
the
purpose
of
harmonising
solar
and
lunar
time
they
regulated
their
calendar
primarily
by
observation
of
the
moon
rather
than
of
the
sun
their
months
were
lunar
and
their
ordinary
year
consisted
of
twelve
lunar
months
but
the
solar
year
of
three
hundred
and
and
a
quarter
days
exceeds
the
lunar
year
of
twelve
lunar
months
or
three
hundred
and
days
by
eleven
and
a
quarter
days
so
that
in
eight
solar
years
the
excess
amounts
to
ninety
days
or
roughly
three
lunar
months
accordingly
the
greeks
equated
eight
solar
years
to
eight
lunar
years
of
twelve
months
each
by
intercalating
three
lunar
months
of
thirty
days
each
in
the
octennial
cycle
they
intercalated
one
lunar
month
in
the
third
year
of
the
cycle
a
second
lunar
month
in
the
fifth
year
and
a
third
lunar
month
in
the
eighth
year
in
this
way
they
so
to
say
made
the
sun
and
moon
keep
time
together
by
reckoning
lunar
months
as
equivalent
to
eight
solar
years
so
that
if
for
example
the
full
moon
coincided
with
the
summer
solstice
in
one
year
it
coincided
with
it
again
after
the
revolution
of
the
eight
years
cycle
but
not
before
the
equation
was
indeed
not
quite
exact
and
in
order
to
render
it
so
the
greeks
afterwards
found
themselves
obliged
first
to
intercalate
three
days
every
sixteen
years
and
next
to
omit
one
intercalary
month
in
every
period
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
years
but
these
corrections
were
doubtless
refinements
of
a
later
age
they
may
have
been
due
to
the
astronomer
eudoxus
of
cnidus
or
to
cleostratus
of
tenedos
who
were
variously
but
incorrectly
supposed
to
have
instituted
the
octennial
cycle
there
are
strong
grounds
for
holding
that
in
its
simplest
form
the
octennial
cycle
of
lunar
months
dates
from
an
extremely
remote
antiquity
in
greece
that
it
was
in
fact
as
a
greek
writer
tell
us
the
first
systematic
attempt
to
bring
solar
and
the
lunar
time
into
harmony
indeed
if
the
olympiads
were
calculated
as
they
appear
to
have
been
on
the
eight
years
cycle
this
of
itself
suffices
to
place
the
origin
of
the
cycle
not
later
than
the
year
with
which
the
reckoning
by
olympiads
begins
and
when
we
bear
in
mind
the
very
remote
period
from
which
judged
by
the
wonderful
remains
of
mycenae
tiryns
cnossus
and
other
cities
civilisation
in
greek
lands
appears
to
date
it
seems
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
octennial
cycle
based
as
it
was
on
very
simple
observations
for
which
nothing
but
good
eyes
and
almost
no
astronomical
knowledge
was
necessary
may
have
been
handed
down
among
the
inhabitants
of
these
countries
from
ages
that
preceded
by
many
centuries
possibly
by
thousands
of
years
the
great
period
of
greek
literature
and
art
the
supposition
is
confirmed
by
the
traces
which
the
octennial
cycle
has
left
of
itself
in
certain
ancient
greek
customs
and
superstitions
particularly
by
the
evidence
which
points
to
the
conclusion
that
at
two
of
the
oldest
seats
of
monarchy
in
greece
namely
cnossus
and
sparta
the
king
s
tenure
of
office
was
formerly
limited
to
eight
years
we
are
informed
and
may
readily
believe
that
the
motive
which
led
the
greeks
to
adopt
the
eight
years
cycle
was
religious
rather
than
practical
or
scientific
their
aim
was
not
so
much
to
ensure
the
punctual
despatch
of
business
or
to
solve
an
abstract
problem
in
astronomy
as
to
ascertain
the
exact
days
on
which
they
ought
to
sacrifice
to
the
gods
for
the
greeks
regularly
employed
lunar
months
in
their
reckonings
and
accordingly
if
they
had
dated
their
religious
festivals
simply
by
the
number
of
the
month
and
the
day
of
the
month
the
excess
of
eleven
and
a
quarter
days
of
the
solar
over
the
lunar
year
would
have
had
the
effect
of
causing
the
festivals
gradually
to
revolve
throughout
the
whole
circle
of
the
seasons
so
that
in
time
ceremonies
which
properly
belonged
to
winter
would
come
to
be
held
in
summer
and
on
the
contrary
ceremonies
which
were
only
appropriate
to
summer
would
come
to
be
held
in
winter
to
avoid
this
anomaly
and
to
ensure
that
festivals
dated
by
lunar
months
should
fall
at
fixed
or
nearly
fixed
points
in
the
solar
year
the
greeks
adopted
the
octennial
cycle
by
the
simple
expedient
of
intercalating
three
lunar
months
in
every
period
of
eight
years
in
doing
so
they
acted
as
one
of
their
writers
justly
pointed
out
on
a
principle
precisely
the
reverse
of
that
followed
by
the
ancient
egyptians
who
deliberately
regulated
their
religious
festivals
by
a
purely
lunar
calendar
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
them
gradually
to
revolve
throughout
the
whole
circle
of
the
seasons
thus
at
an
early
stage
of
culture
the
regulation
of
the
calendar
is
largely
an
affair
of
religion
it
is
a
means
of
maintaining
the
established
relations
between
gods
and
men
on
a
satisfactory
footing
and
in
public
opinion
the
great
evil
of
a
disordered
calendar
is
not
so
much
that
it
disturbs
and
disarranges
the
ordinary
course
of
business
and
the
various
transactions
of
civil
life
as
that
it
endangers
the
welfare
or
even
the
existence
both
of
individuals
and
of
the
community
by
interrupting
their
normal
intercourse
with
those
divine
powers
on
whose
favour
men
believe
themselves
to
be
absolutely
dependent
hence
in
states
which
take
this
view
of
the
deep
religious
import
of
the
calendar
its
superintendence
is
naturally
entrusted
to
priests
rather
than
to
astronomers
because
the
science
of
astronomy
is
regarded
merely
as
ancillary
to
the
deeper
mysteries
of
theology
for
example
at
rome
the
method
of
determining
the
months
and
regulating
the
festivals
was
a
secret
which
the
pontiffs
for
ages
jealously
guarded
from
the
profane
vulgar
and
in
consequence
of
their
ignorance
and
incapacity
the
calendar
fell
into
confusion
and
the
festivals
were
celebrated
out
of
their
natural
seasons
until
the
greatest
of
all
the
roman
pontiffs
julius
caesar
remedied
the
confusion
and
placed
the
calendar
of
the
civilised
world
on
the
firm
foundation
on
which
with
little
change
it
stands
to
this
day
on
the
whole
then
it
appears
probable
that
the
octennial
cycle
based
on
considerations
of
religion
and
on
elementary
observations
of
the
two
great
luminaries
dated
from
a
very
remote
period
among
the
ancient
greeks
if
they
did
not
bring
it
with
them
when
they
migrated
southwards
from
the
oakwoods
and
beechwoods
of
central
europe
they
may
well
have
taken
it
over
from
their
civilised
predecessors
of
different
blood
and
different
language
whom
they
found
leading
a
settled
agricultural
life
on
the
lands
about
the
aegean
sea
now
we
have
seen
reasons
to
hold
that
the
two
most
famous
of
the
great
greek
games
the
pythian
and
the
olympian
were
both
based
on
the
ancient
cycle
of
eight
years
and
that
the
quadriennial
period
at
which
they
were
regularly
celebrated
in
historical
times
was
arrived
at
by
a
subdivision
of
the
older
octennial
cycle
it
is
hardly
rash
therefore
to
conjecture
that
the
quadriennial
period
in
general
regarded
as
the
normal
period
for
the
celebration
of
great
games
and
festivals
was
originally
founded
on
elementary
religious
and
astronomical
considerations
of
the
same
kind
that
is
on
a
somewhat
crude
attempt
to
harmonise
the
discrepancies
of
solar
and
lunar
time
and
thereby
to
ensure
the
continued
favour
of
the
gods
it
is
indeed
certain
or
probable
that
some
of
these
quadriennial
festivals
were
celebrated
in
honour
of
the
dead
but
there
seems
to
be
nothing
in
the
beliefs
or
customs
of
the
ancient
greeks
concerning
the
dead
which
would
suggest
a
quadriennial
period
as
an
appropriate
one
for
propitiating
the
ghosts
of
the
departed
at
first
sight
it
is
different
with
the
octennial
period
for
according
to
pindar
the
souls
of
the
dead
who
had
been
purged
of
their
guilt
by
an
abode
of
eight
years
in
the
nether
world
were
born
again
on
earth
in
the
ninth
year
as
glorious
kings
athletes
and
sages
now
if
this
belief
in
the
reincarnation
of
the
dead
after
eight
years
were
primitive
it
might
certainly
furnish
an
excellent
reason
for
honouring
the
ghosts
of
great
men
at
their
graves
every
eight
years
in
order
to
facilitate
their
rebirth
into
the
world
yet
the
period
of
eight
years
thus
rigidly
applied
to
the
life
of
disembodied
spirits
appears
too
arbitrary
and
conventional
to
be
really
primitive
and
we
may
suspect
that
in
this
application
it
was
nothing
but
an
inference
drawn
from
the
old
octennial
cycle
which
had
been
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
reconciling
solar
and
lunar
time
if
that
was
so
it
will
follow
that
the
quadriennial
period
of
funeral
games
was
like
the
similar
period
of
other
religious
festivals
obtained
through
the
bisection
of
the
octennial
cycle
and
hence
that
it
was
ultimately
derived
from
astronomical
considerations
rather
than
from
any
beliefs
touching
a
quadriennial
revolution
in
the
state
of
the
dead
yet
in
historical
times
it
may
well
have
happened
that
these
considerations
were
forgotten
and
that
games
and
festivals
were
instituted
at
quadriennial
intervals
for
example
at
plataea
in
honour
of
the
slain
at
actium
to
commemorate
the
great
victory
and
at
mantinea
in
honour
of
antinous
without
any
conscious
reference
to
the
sun
and
moon
and
merely
because
that
period
had
from
time
immemorial
been
regarded
as
the
proper
and
normal
one
for
the
celebration
of
certain
solemn
religious
rites
if
we
enquire
why
the
greeks
so
often
bisected
the
old
octennial
period
into
two
quadriennial
periods
for
purposes
of
religion
the
answer
can
only
be
conjectural
for
no
positive
information
appears
to
be
given
us
on
the
subject
by
ancient
writers
perhaps
they
thought
that
eight
years
was
too
long
a
time
to
elapse
between
the
solemn
services
and
that
it
was
desirable
to
propitiate
the
deities
at
shorter
intervals
but
it
is
possible
that
political
as
well
as
religious
motives
may
have
operated
to
produce
the
change
we
have
seen
reason
to
think
that
at
two
of
the
oldest
seats
of
monarchy
in
greece
namely
cnossus
and
sparta
kings
formerly
held
office
for
periods
of
eight
years
only
after
which
their
sovereignty
either
terminated
or
had
to
be
formally
renewed
now
with
the
gradual
growth
of
that
democratic
sentiment
which
ultimately
dominated
greek
political
life
men
would
become
more
and
more
jealous
of
the
kingly
power
and
would
seek
to
restrict
it
within
narrower
limits
and
one
of
the
most
obvious
means
of
doing
so
was
to
shorten
the
king
s
tenure
of
office
we
know
that
this
was
done
at
athens
where
the
dynasty
of
the
medontids
was
reduced
from
the
rank
of
monarchs
for
life
to
that
of
magistrates
holding
office
for
ten
years
only
it
is
possible
that
elsewhere
the
king
s
reign
was
cut
down
from
eight
years
to
four
years
and
if
i
am
right
in
my
explanation
of
the
origin
of
the
olympic
games
this
political
revolution
actually
took
place
at
olympia
where
the
victors
in
the
would
seem
at
first
to
have
personated
the
and
perhaps
held
office
in
the
capacity
of
divine
kings
during
the
intervals
between
successive
celebrations
of
the
games
if
at
olympia
and
elsewhere
the
games
were
of
old
primarily
contests
in
which
the
king
had
personally
to
take
part
for
the
purpose
of
attesting
his
bodily
vigour
and
therefore
his
capacity
for
office
the
repetition
of
the
test
at
intervals
of
four
instead
of
eight
years
might
be
regarded
as
furnishing
a
better
guarantee
of
the
maintenance
of
the
king
s
efficiency
and
thereby
of
the
general
welfare
which
in
primitive
society
is
often
supposed
to
be
sympathetically
bound
up
with
the
health
and
strength
of
the
king
but
while
many
of
the
great
greek
games
were
celebrated
at
intervals
of
four
years
others
such
as
the
nemean
and
the
isthmian
were
celebrated
at
intervals
of
two
years
only
and
just
as
the
quadriennial
period
seems
to
have
been
arrived
at
through
a
bisection
of
the
octennial
period
so
we
may
surmise
that
the
biennial
period
was
produced
by
a
bisection
of
the
quadriennial
period
this
was
the
view
which
the
admirable
modern
chronologer
ideler
took
of
the
origin
of
the
quadriennial
and
biennial
festivals
respectively
and
it
appears
far
more
probable
than
the
contrary
opinion
of
the
ancient
chronologer
censorinus
that
the
quadriennial
period
was
reached
by
doubling
the
biennial
and
the
octennial
period
by
doubling
the
quadriennial
the
theory
of
censorinus
was
that
the
greeks
started
with
a
biennial
cycle
of
twelve
and
thirteen
lunar
months
alternately
in
successive
years
for
the
purpose
of
harmonising
solar
and
lunar
time
but
as
the
cycle
so
produced
exceeds
the
true
solar
time
by
seven
and
a
half
days
the
discrepancy
which
it
leaves
between
the
two
great
celestial
clocks
the
sun
and
moon
was
too
glaring
to
escape
the
observation
even
of
simple
farmers
who
would
soon
have
been
painfully
sensible
that
the
times
were
out
of
joint
if
they
had
attempted
to
regulate
the
various
operations
of
the
agricultural
year
by
reference
to
so
very
inaccurate
an
almanac
it
is
unlikely
therefore
that
the
greeks
ever
made
much
use
of
a
biennial
cycle
of
this
sort
now
to
apply
these
conclusions
to
the
eleusinian
games
which
furnished
the
for
the
preceding
discussion
whatever
the
origin
and
meaning
of
these
games
may
have
been
we
may
surmise
that
the
quadriennial
and
biennial
periods
at
which
they
were
held
were
originally
derived
from
astronomical
considerations
and
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
directly
either
with
the
agricultural
cycle
which
is
annual
nor
with
the
worship
of
the
dead
which
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
any
cycle
at
all
unless
indeed
it
be
an
annual
one
in
other
words
neither
the
needs
of
husbandry
nor
the
superstitions
relating
to
ghosts
furnish
any
natural
explanation
of
the
quadriennial
and
biennial
periods
of
the
eleusinian
games
and
to
discover
such
an
explanation
we
are
obliged
to
fall
back
on
astronomy
or
to
be
more
exact
on
that
blend
of
astronomy
with
religion
which
appears
to
be
mainly
responsible
for
such
greek
festivals
as
exceed
a
year
in
their
period
to
admit
this
is
not
to
decide
the
question
whether
the
eleusinian
games
were
agricultural
or
funereal
in
character
but
it
is
implicitly
to
acknowledge
that
the
games
were
of
later
origin
than
the
annual
ceremonies
including
the
great
mysteries
which
were
designed
to
propitiate
the
deities
of
the
corn
for
the
very
simple
and
practical
purpose
of
ensuring
good
crops
within
the
year
for
it
can
not
but
be
that
men
observed
and
laid
their
account
with
the
annual
changes
of
the
seasons
especially
as
manifested
by
the
growth
and
maturity
of
the
crops
long
before
they
attempted
to
reconcile
the
discrepancies
of
solar
and
lunar
time
by
a
series
of
observations
extending
over
several
years
on
the
whole
then
if
ignoring
theories
we
adhere
to
the
evidence
of
the
ancients
themselves
in
regard
to
the
rites
of
eleusis
including
under
that
general
term
the
great
mysteries
the
games
the
festival
before
ploughing
the
festival
of
the
the
green
festival
the
festival
of
the
cornstalks
and
the
offerings
of
we
shall
probably
incline
to
agree
with
the
most
learned
of
ancient
antiquaries
the
roman
varro
who
to
quote
augustine
s
report
of
his
opinion
interpreted
the
whole
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
as
relating
to
the
corn
which
ceres
demeter
had
discovered
and
to
proserpine
persephone
whom
pluto
had
carried
off
from
her
and
proserpine
herself
he
said
signifies
the
fecundity
of
the
seeds
the
failure
of
which
at
a
certain
time
had
caused
the
earth
to
mourn
for
barrenness
and
therefore
had
given
rise
to
the
opinion
that
the
daughter
of
ceres
that
is
fecundity
itself
had
been
ravished
by
pluto
and
detained
in
the
nether
world
and
when
the
dearth
had
been
publicly
mourned
and
fecundity
had
returned
once
more
there
was
gladness
at
the
return
of
proserpine
and
solemn
rites
were
instituted
accordingly
after
that
he
says
continues
augustine
reporting
varro
that
many
things
were
taught
in
her
mysteries
which
had
no
reference
but
to
the
discovery
of
the
thus
far
i
have
for
the
most
part
assumed
an
identity
of
nature
between
demeter
and
persephone
the
divine
mother
and
daughter
personifying
the
corn
in
its
double
aspect
of
the
of
last
year
and
the
ripe
ears
of
this
and
i
pointed
out
that
this
view
of
the
substantial
unity
of
mother
and
daughter
is
borne
out
by
their
portraits
in
greek
art
which
are
often
so
alike
as
to
be
indistinguishable
such
a
close
resemblance
between
the
artistic
types
of
demeter
and
persephone
militates
decidedly
against
the
view
that
the
two
goddesses
are
mythical
embodiments
of
two
things
so
different
and
so
easily
distinguishable
from
each
other
as
the
earth
and
the
vegetation
which
springs
from
it
had
greek
artists
accepted
that
view
of
demeter
and
persephone
they
could
surely
have
devised
types
of
them
which
would
have
brought
out
the
deep
distinction
between
the
goddesses
that
they
were
capable
of
doing
so
is
proved
by
the
simple
fact
that
they
regularly
represented
the
earth
goddess
by
a
type
which
differed
widely
both
from
that
of
demeter
and
from
that
of
persephone
not
only
so
but
they
sometimes
set
the
two
types
of
the
earth
goddess
and
the
corn
goddess
demeter
side
by
side
as
if
on
purpose
to
demonstrate
their
difference
thus
at
patrae
there
was
a
sanctuary
of
demeter
in
which
she
and
persephone
were
portrayed
standing
while
earth
was
represented
by
a
seated
image
and
on
a
the
earth
goddess
is
seen
appropriately
emerging
from
the
ground
with
a
horn
of
plenty
and
an
infant
in
her
uplifted
arms
while
demeter
and
persephone
scarcely
distinguishable
from
each
other
stand
at
full
height
behind
her
looking
down
at
her
figure
and
triptolemus
in
his
wheeled
car
sits
directly
above
her
in
this
instructive
picture
accordingly
we
see
grouped
together
the
principal
personages
in
the
myth
of
the
corn
the
earth
goddess
the
two
goddesses
of
the
old
and
the
new
corn
and
the
hero
who
is
said
to
have
been
sent
forth
by
the
corn
goddess
to
sow
the
seed
broadcast
over
the
earth
such
representations
seem
to
prove
that
the
artists
clearly
distinguished
demeter
from
the
earth
goddess
and
if
demeter
did
not
personify
the
earth
can
there
be
any
reasonable
doubt
that
like
her
daughter
she
personified
the
corn
which
was
so
commonly
called
by
her
name
from
the
time
of
homer
downwards
the
essential
identity
of
mother
and
daughter
is
suggested
not
only
by
the
close
resemblance
of
their
artistic
types
but
also
by
the
official
title
of
the
two
goddesses
which
was
regularly
applied
to
them
in
the
great
sanctuary
at
eleusis
without
any
specification
of
their
individual
attributes
and
titles
as
if
their
separate
individualities
had
almost
merged
in
a
single
divine
substance
surveying
the
evidence
as
a
whole
we
may
say
that
from
the
myth
of
demeter
and
persephone
from
their
ritual
from
their
representations
in
art
from
the
titles
which
they
bore
from
the
offerings
of
which
were
presented
to
them
and
from
the
names
applied
to
the
cereals
we
are
fairly
entitled
to
conclude
that
in
the
mind
of
the
ordinary
greek
the
two
goddesses
were
essentially
personifications
of
the
corn
and
that
in
this
germ
the
whole
efflorescence
of
their
religion
finds
implicitly
its
explanation
but
to
maintain
this
is
not
to
deny
that
in
the
long
course
of
religious
evolution
high
moral
and
spiritual
conceptions
were
grafted
on
this
simple
original
stock
and
blossomed
out
into
fairer
flowers
than
the
bloom
of
the
barley
and
the
wheat
above
all
the
thought
of
the
seed
buried
in
the
earth
in
order
to
spring
up
to
new
and
higher
life
readily
suggested
a
comparison
with
human
destiny
and
strengthened
the
hope
that
for
man
too
the
grave
may
be
but
the
beginning
of
a
better
and
happier
existence
in
some
brighter
world
unknown
this
simple
and
natural
reflection
seems
perfectly
sufficient
to
explain
the
association
of
the
corn
goddess
at
eleusis
with
the
mystery
of
death
and
the
hope
of
a
blissful
immortality
for
that
the
ancients
regarded
initiation
in
the
eleusinian
mysteries
as
a
key
to
unlock
the
gates
of
paradise
appears
to
be
proved
by
the
allusions
which
writers
among
them
drop
to
the
happiness
in
store
for
the
initiated
hereafter
no
doubt
it
is
easy
for
us
to
discern
the
flimsiness
of
the
logical
foundation
on
which
such
high
hopes
were
built
but
drowning
men
clutch
at
straws
and
we
need
not
wonder
that
the
greeks
like
ourselves
with
death
before
them
and
a
great
love
of
life
in
their
hearts
should
not
have
stopped
to
weigh
with
too
nice
a
hand
the
arguments
that
told
for
and
against
the
prospect
of
human
immortality
the
reasoning
that
satisfied
saint
paul
and
has
brought
comfort
to
untold
thousands
of
sorrowing
christians
standing
by
the
deathbed
or
the
open
grave
of
their
loved
ones
was
good
enough
to
pass
muster
with
ancient
pagans
when
they
too
bowed
their
heads
under
the
burden
of
grief
and
with
the
taper
of
life
burning
low
in
the
socket
looked
forward
into
the
darkness
of
the
unknown
therefore
we
do
no
indignity
to
the
myth
of
demeter
and
of
the
few
myths
in
which
the
sunshine
and
clarity
of
the
greek
genius
are
crossed
by
the
shadow
and
mystery
of
we
trace
its
origin
to
some
of
the
most
familiar
yet
eternally
affecting
aspects
of
nature
to
the
melancholy
gloom
and
decay
of
autumn
and
to
the
freshness
the
brightness
and
the
verdure
of
spring
chapter
iii
magical
significance
of
games
in
primitive
agriculture
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
saw
that
among
the
rites
of
eleusis
were
comprised
certain
athletic
sports
such
as
leaping
wrestling
and
boxing
the
victors
in
which
were
rewarded
with
measures
of
barley
distributed
among
them
by
the
priests
these
sports
the
ancients
themselves
associated
with
the
worship
of
demeter
and
persephone
the
goddesses
of
the
corn
and
strange
as
such
an
association
may
seem
to
us
it
is
not
without
its
analogy
among
the
harvest
customs
of
modern
european
peasantry
but
to
discover
clear
cases
of
games
practised
for
the
express
purpose
of
promoting
the
growth
of
the
crops
we
must
turn
to
more
primitive
agricultural
communities
than
the
athenians
of
classical
antiquity
or
the
peoples
of
modern
europe
such
communities
may
be
found
at
the
present
day
among
the
savage
tribes
of
borneo
and
new
guinea
who
subsist
mainly
by
tilling
the
ground
among
them
we
take
the
kayans
or
bahaus
of
central
borneo
as
typical
they
are
essentially
an
agricultural
people
and
devote
themselves
mainly
to
the
cultivation
of
rice
which
furnishes
their
staple
food
all
other
products
of
the
ground
are
of
subordinate
importance
hence
agriculture
we
are
told
dominates
the
whole
life
of
these
tribes
their
year
is
the
year
of
the
cultivation
of
the
rice
and
they
divide
it
into
various
periods
which
are
determined
by
the
conditions
necessary
for
the
tilling
of
the
fields
and
the
manipulation
of
the
rice
in
tribes
whose
thoughts
are
so
much
engrossed
by
agriculture
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
associate
with
it
their
ideas
of
the
powers
which
rule
them
for
good
or
evil
the
stands
in
close
connexion
with
the
agriculture
of
the
bahaus
without
the
consent
of
the
spirits
no
work
in
the
fields
may
be
undertaken
moreover
all
the
great
popular
festivals
coincide
with
the
different
periods
of
the
cultivation
of
the
rice
as
the
people
are
in
an
unusual
state
of
affluence
after
harvest
all
family
festivals
which
require
a
large
outlay
are
for
practical
reasons
deferred
till
the
new
year
festival
at
the
end
of
harvest
the
two
mighty
spirits
amei
awi
and
his
wife
buring
une
who
according
to
the
belief
of
the
kayans
live
in
a
world
under
ground
dominate
the
whole
of
the
tillage
and
determine
the
issue
of
the
harvest
in
great
measure
by
the
behaviour
of
the
owner
of
the
land
not
so
much
by
his
moral
conduct
as
by
the
offerings
he
has
made
to
the
spirits
and
the
attention
he
has
paid
to
their
warnings
an
important
part
in
agriculture
falls
to
the
chief
at
the
festivals
he
has
in
the
name
of
the
whole
tribe
to
see
to
it
that
the
prescribed
conjurations
are
carried
out
by
the
priestesses
all
religious
ceremonies
required
for
the
cultivation
of
the
ground
take
place
in
a
small
specially
set
apart
for
that
purpose
called
here
the
chief
s
family
ushers
in
every
fresh
operation
in
the
cultivation
of
the
rice
such
as
sowing
hoeing
and
reaping
the
solemn
actions
there
performed
have
a
symbolical
not
only
the
chief
s
family
among
the
kayans
has
such
a
consecrated
field
every
family
possesses
one
of
its
own
these
little
fields
are
never
cultivated
for
the
sake
of
their
produce
they
serve
only
as
the
scene
of
religious
ceremonies
and
of
those
symbolical
operations
of
agriculture
which
are
afterwards
performed
in
earnest
on
the
real
for
example
at
the
festival
before
sowing
a
priestess
sows
some
rice
on
the
consecrated
field
of
the
chief
s
family
and
then
calls
on
a
number
of
young
men
and
girls
to
complete
the
work
the
young
men
then
dig
holes
in
the
ground
with
and
the
girls
come
behind
them
and
plant
the
in
the
holes
afterwards
the
priestesses
lay
offerings
of
food
wrapt
in
here
and
there
on
the
holy
field
while
they
croon
prayers
to
the
spirits
in
soft
tones
which
are
half
drowned
in
the
clashing
music
of
the
gongs
on
another
day
women
gather
all
kinds
of
edible
leaves
in
their
gardens
and
fields
boil
them
in
water
and
then
sprinkle
the
water
on
the
consecrated
but
on
that
and
other
days
of
the
festival
the
people
attend
also
to
their
own
wants
banqueting
on
a
favourite
species
of
rice
and
other
dainties
the
ceremonies
connected
with
sowing
last
several
weeks
and
during
this
time
certain
taboos
have
to
be
observed
by
the
people
thus
on
the
first
day
of
the
festival
the
whole
population
except
the
very
old
and
the
very
young
must
refrain
from
bathing
after
that
there
follows
a
period
of
rest
for
eight
nights
during
which
the
people
may
neither
work
nor
hold
intercourse
with
their
neighbours
on
the
tenth
day
the
prohibition
to
bathe
is
again
enforced
and
during
the
eight
following
days
the
great
of
the
village
where
the
real
crops
are
raised
is
sowed
the
reason
for
excluding
strangers
from
the
village
at
these
times
is
a
religious
one
it
is
a
fear
lest
the
presence
of
strangers
might
frighten
the
spirits
or
put
them
in
a
bad
humour
and
so
defeat
the
object
of
the
ceremony
for
while
the
religious
ceremonies
which
accompany
the
cultivation
of
the
rice
differ
somewhat
from
each
other
in
different
tribes
the
ideas
at
the
bottom
of
them
we
are
told
are
everywhere
the
same
the
aim
always
is
to
appease
and
propitiate
the
souls
of
the
rice
and
the
other
spirits
by
sacrifices
of
all
sorts
however
during
this
obligatory
period
of
seclusion
and
rest
the
kayans
employ
themselves
in
various
pursuits
which
though
at
first
sight
they
might
seem
to
serve
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
recreation
have
really
in
the
minds
of
the
people
a
much
deeper
significance
for
example
at
this
time
the
men
often
play
at
spinning
tops
the
tops
are
smooth
flat
pieces
of
wood
weighing
several
pounds
each
man
tries
to
spin
his
own
top
so
that
it
knocks
down
those
of
his
neighbours
and
continues
itself
to
revolve
triumphantly
new
tops
are
commonly
carved
for
the
festival
the
older
men
sometimes
use
heavy
tops
of
again
every
evening
the
young
men
assemble
in
the
open
space
before
the
chief
s
house
and
engage
in
contests
of
strength
and
agility
while
the
women
watch
them
from
the
long
gallery
or
verandah
of
the
house
another
popular
pastime
during
the
festival
of
sowing
is
a
masquerade
it
takes
place
on
the
evening
of
the
tenth
day
the
day
on
which
for
the
second
time
the
people
are
forbidden
to
bathe
the
scene
of
the
performance
is
again
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
chief
s
house
as
the
day
draws
towards
evening
the
villagers
begin
to
assemble
in
the
gallery
or
verandah
of
the
house
in
order
to
secure
good
places
for
viewing
the
masquerade
all
the
maskers
at
these
ceremonies
represent
evil
spirits
the
men
wear
ugly
wooden
masks
on
their
faces
and
their
bodies
are
swathed
in
masses
of
slit
banana
leaves
so
as
to
imitate
the
hideous
faces
and
hairy
bodies
of
the
demons
the
young
women
wear
on
their
heads
cylindrical
baskets
which
conceal
their
real
features
while
they
exhibit
to
the
spectators
grotesque
human
faces
formed
by
stitches
on
pieces
of
white
cotton
which
are
fastened
to
the
baskets
on
the
occasion
when
nieuwenhuis
witnessed
the
ceremony
the
first
to
appear
on
the
scene
were
some
men
wearing
wooden
masks
and
helmets
and
so
thickly
wrapt
in
banana
leaves
that
they
looked
like
moving
masses
of
green
foliage
they
danced
silently
keeping
time
to
the
beat
of
the
gongs
they
were
followed
by
other
figures
some
of
whom
executed
but
the
weight
of
their
leafy
envelope
was
such
that
they
soon
grew
tired
and
though
they
leaped
high
they
uttered
none
of
the
wild
which
usually
accompany
these
martial
exercises
when
darkness
fell
the
dances
ceased
and
were
replaced
by
a
little
drama
representing
a
boar
brought
to
bay
by
a
pack
of
hounds
the
part
of
the
boar
was
played
by
an
actor
wearing
a
wooden
boar
s
head
mask
who
ran
about
on
all
fours
and
grunted
in
a
manner
while
the
hounds
acted
by
young
men
snarled
yelped
and
made
dashes
at
him
the
play
was
watched
with
lively
interest
and
peals
of
laughter
by
the
spectators
later
in
the
evening
eight
disguised
girls
danced
one
behind
the
other
with
slow
steps
and
waving
arms
to
the
glimmering
light
of
torches
and
the
strains
of
a
sort
of
jew
s
harp
the
rites
which
accompany
the
sowing
of
the
fields
are
no
sooner
over
than
those
which
usher
in
the
hoeing
begin
like
the
sowing
ceremonies
they
are
inaugurated
by
a
priestess
who
hoes
the
sacred
field
round
about
a
sacrificial
stage
and
then
calls
upon
other
people
to
complete
the
work
after
that
the
holy
field
is
again
sprinkled
with
a
decoction
of
herbs
but
the
crowning
point
of
the
kayan
year
is
the
new
year
festival
the
harvest
has
then
been
fully
housed
abundance
reigns
in
every
family
and
for
eight
days
the
people
dressed
out
in
all
their
finery
give
themselves
up
to
mirth
and
jollity
the
festival
was
witnessed
by
the
dutch
explorer
nieuwenhuis
to
lure
the
good
spirits
from
the
spirit
land
baskets
filled
with
precious
objects
were
set
out
before
the
windows
and
the
priestesses
made
long
speeches
in
which
they
invited
these
beneficent
beings
to
come
to
the
chief
s
house
and
to
stay
there
during
the
whole
of
the
ceremonies
two
days
afterwards
one
of
the
priestesses
harangued
the
spirits
for
of
an
hour
telling
them
who
the
kayans
were
from
whom
the
chief
s
family
was
descended
what
the
tribe
was
doing
and
what
were
its
wishes
not
forgetting
to
implore
the
vengeance
of
the
spirits
on
the
the
hereditary
foes
of
the
kayans
the
harangue
was
couched
in
rhyming
verse
and
delivered
in
tones
five
days
later
eight
priestesses
ascended
a
sacrificial
stage
on
which
food
was
daily
set
forth
for
the
spirits
there
they
joined
hands
and
crooned
another
long
address
to
the
spirits
marking
the
time
with
their
hands
then
a
basket
containing
offerings
of
food
was
handed
up
to
them
and
one
of
the
priestesses
opened
it
and
invited
the
spirits
to
enter
the
basket
when
they
were
supposed
to
have
done
so
the
lid
was
shut
down
on
them
and
the
basket
with
the
spirits
in
it
was
conveyed
into
the
chief
s
house
as
the
priestesses
in
the
performance
of
the
sacred
ceremonies
might
not
touch
the
ground
planks
were
cut
from
a
and
laid
on
the
ground
for
them
to
step
on
but
the
great
feature
of
the
new
year
festival
is
the
sacrifice
of
pigs
of
which
the
spiritual
essence
is
appropriately
offered
to
the
spirits
while
their
material
substance
is
consumed
by
the
worshippers
in
carrying
out
this
highly
satisfactory
arrangement
while
the
live
pigs
lay
tethered
in
a
row
on
the
ground
the
priestesses
danced
solemnly
round
a
sacrificial
stage
each
of
them
arrayed
in
a
of
and
wearing
a
on
her
head
and
on
either
side
two
priests
armed
with
swords
executed
war
dances
for
the
purpose
of
scaring
away
evil
spirits
by
their
gesticulations
the
priestesses
indicated
to
the
powers
above
that
the
pigs
were
intended
for
their
benefit
one
of
them
a
fat
but
dignified
lady
dancing
composedly
seemed
by
her
courteous
gestures
to
invite
the
souls
of
the
pigs
to
ascend
up
to
heaven
but
others
not
content
with
this
too
ideal
offering
rushed
at
the
pigs
seized
the
smallest
of
them
by
the
hind
legs
and
exerting
all
their
strength
danced
with
the
squealing
porker
to
and
from
the
sacrificial
stage
in
the
evening
before
darkness
fell
the
animals
were
slaughtered
and
their
livers
examined
for
omens
if
the
under
side
of
the
liver
was
pale
the
omen
was
good
but
if
it
was
dark
the
omen
was
evil
on
the
last
day
of
the
festival
one
of
the
chief
priestesses
in
martial
array
danced
round
the
sacrificial
stage
making
passes
with
her
old
sword
as
if
she
would
heave
the
whole
structure
heavenward
while
others
stabbed
with
spears
at
the
foul
fiends
that
might
be
hovering
in
the
air
intent
on
disturbing
the
sacred
ministers
at
their
holy
work
thus
says
nieuwenhuis
reviewing
the
agricultural
rites
which
he
witnessed
among
the
kayans
on
the
mendalam
river
every
fresh
operation
on
the
was
ushered
in
by
religious
and
culinary
ceremonies
during
which
the
community
had
always
to
observe
taboos
for
several
nights
and
to
play
certain
definite
games
as
we
saw
games
and
masquerades
were
played
during
the
sowing
festival
at
the
first
bringing
in
of
the
rice
the
people
pelted
each
other
with
clay
pellets
discharged
from
small
but
in
former
times
sham
fights
took
place
with
wooden
swords
while
during
the
new
year
festival
the
men
contend
with
each
other
in
wrestling
high
leaps
long
leaps
and
running
the
women
also
fight
each
other
with
great
glee
using
bamboo
vessels
full
of
water
for
their
principal
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
sports
and
pastimes
which
custom
prescribes
to
the
kayans
on
these
occasions
are
they
mere
diversions
meant
to
while
away
the
tedium
of
the
holidays
or
have
they
a
serious
perhaps
a
religious
or
magical
significance
to
this
question
it
will
be
well
to
let
nieuwenhuis
give
his
answer
the
kayans
on
the
mendalam
river
he
says
enjoy
tolerably
regular
harvests
and
their
agricultural
festivals
accordingly
take
place
every
year
whereas
the
kayans
on
the
mahakam
river
on
account
of
the
frequent
failure
of
the
harvests
can
celebrate
a
new
year
s
festival
only
once
in
every
two
or
three
years
yet
although
these
festivities
are
celebrated
more
regularly
on
the
mendalam
river
they
are
followed
on
the
mahakam
river
with
livelier
interest
and
the
meaning
of
all
ceremonies
and
games
can
also
be
traced
much
better
there
on
the
mendalam
river
i
came
to
the
false
conclusion
that
the
popular
games
which
take
place
at
the
festivals
are
undertaken
quite
arbitrarily
at
the
seasons
of
sowing
and
harvest
but
on
the
mahakam
river
on
the
contrary
i
observed
that
even
the
masquerade
at
the
sowing
festival
is
invested
with
as
deep
a
significance
as
any
of
the
ceremonies
performed
by
the
the
influence
of
religious
worship
which
dominates
the
whole
life
of
the
dyak
tribes
manifests
itself
also
in
their
games
this
holds
good
chiefly
of
pastimes
in
which
all
adults
take
part
together
mostly
on
definite
occasions
it
is
less
applicable
to
more
individual
pastimes
which
are
not
restricted
to
any
special
season
pastimes
of
the
former
sort
are
very
rarely
indulged
in
at
ordinary
times
and
properly
speaking
they
attain
their
full
significance
only
on
the
occasion
of
the
agricultural
festivals
which
bear
a
strictly
religious
stamp
even
then
the
recreations
are
not
left
to
choice
but
definite
games
belong
to
definite
festivals
thus
at
the
sowing
festivals
other
amusements
are
in
vogue
than
at
the
little
harvest
festival
or
the
great
harvest
festival
at
the
beginning
of
the
reaping
and
at
the
new
year
festival
is
this
connexion
between
festivals
and
games
merely
an
accidental
one
or
is
it
based
on
a
real
affinity
the
latter
seems
to
me
the
more
probable
view
for
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
most
important
games
played
by
men
i
was
able
to
prove
directly
a
religious
significance
and
although
i
failed
to
do
so
in
the
case
of
the
others
i
conjecture
nevertheless
that
a
religious
idea
lies
at
the
bottom
of
all
other
games
which
are
connected
with
definite
if
the
reader
should
entertain
any
doubt
on
the
subject
and
should
suspect
that
in
arriving
at
this
conclusion
the
dutch
traveller
gave
the
reins
to
his
fancy
rather
than
followed
the
real
opinion
of
the
people
these
doubts
and
suspicions
will
probably
be
dispelled
by
comparing
the
similar
games
which
another
primitive
agricultural
people
avowedly
play
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
good
crops
the
people
in
question
are
the
kai
of
german
new
guinea
who
inhabit
the
rugged
densely
wooded
mountains
inland
from
finsch
harbour
they
subsist
mainly
on
the
produce
of
the
taro
and
yams
which
they
cultivate
in
their
fields
though
the
more
inland
people
also
make
much
use
of
sweet
potatoes
all
their
crops
are
root
crops
no
patch
of
ground
is
cultivated
for
more
than
a
year
at
a
time
as
soon
as
it
has
yielded
a
crop
it
is
deserted
for
another
and
is
quickly
overgrown
with
rank
weeds
bamboos
and
bushes
in
six
or
eight
years
when
the
undergrowth
has
died
out
under
the
shadow
of
the
taller
trees
which
have
shot
up
the
land
may
again
be
cleared
and
brought
under
cultivation
thus
the
area
of
cultivation
shifts
from
year
to
year
and
the
villages
are
not
much
more
permanent
for
in
the
damp
tropical
climate
the
wooden
houses
soon
rot
and
fall
into
ruins
and
when
this
happens
the
site
of
the
village
is
changed
to
procure
good
crops
of
the
taro
and
yams
on
which
they
depend
for
their
subsistence
the
kai
resort
to
many
superstitious
practices
for
example
in
order
to
make
the
yams
strike
deep
roots
they
touch
the
shoots
with
the
bone
of
a
wild
animal
that
has
been
killed
in
the
recesses
of
a
cave
imagining
that
just
as
the
creature
penetrated
deep
into
the
earth
so
the
shoots
that
have
been
touched
with
its
bone
will
descend
deep
into
the
ground
and
in
order
that
the
taro
may
bear
large
and
heavy
fruit
they
place
the
shoots
before
planting
them
on
a
large
and
heavy
block
of
stone
believing
that
the
stone
will
communicate
its
valuable
properties
of
size
and
weight
to
the
future
fruit
moreover
great
use
is
made
of
spells
and
incantations
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
and
all
persons
who
utter
such
magical
formulas
for
this
purpose
have
to
abstain
from
eating
certain
foods
until
the
plants
have
sprouted
and
give
promise
of
a
good
crop
for
example
they
may
not
eat
young
bamboo
shoots
which
are
a
favourite
article
of
diet
with
the
people
the
reason
is
that
the
young
shoots
are
covered
with
fine
prickles
which
cause
itching
and
irritation
of
the
skin
from
which
the
kai
infer
that
if
an
enchanter
of
field
fruits
were
to
eat
bamboo
shoots
the
contagion
of
their
prickles
would
be
conveyed
through
him
to
the
fruits
and
would
manifest
itself
in
a
pungent
disagreeable
flavour
for
a
similar
reason
no
charmer
of
the
crops
who
knows
his
business
would
dream
of
eating
crabs
because
he
is
well
aware
that
if
he
were
to
do
so
the
leaves
and
stalks
of
the
plants
would
be
dashed
in
pieces
by
a
pelting
rain
just
like
the
long
thin
brittle
legs
of
a
dead
crab
again
were
such
an
enchanter
to
eat
any
of
the
edible
kinds
of
locusts
it
seems
obvious
to
the
kai
that
locusts
would
devour
the
crops
over
which
the
imprudent
wizard
had
recited
his
spells
above
all
people
who
are
concerned
in
planting
fields
must
on
no
account
eat
pork
because
pigs
whether
wild
or
tame
are
the
most
deadly
enemies
of
the
crops
which
they
grub
up
and
destroy
from
which
it
follows
as
surely
as
the
night
does
the
day
that
if
you
eat
pork
while
you
are
at
work
on
the
farm
your
fields
will
be
devastated
by
inroads
of
pigs
however
these
precautions
are
not
the
only
measures
which
the
kai
people
adopt
for
the
benefit
of
the
yams
and
the
taro
in
the
opinion
of
the
natives
various
games
are
important
for
a
proper
growth
of
the
hence
these
games
may
only
be
played
in
the
time
after
the
work
on
the
fields
has
been
done
thus
to
swing
on
a
long
spanish
reed
fastened
to
a
branch
of
a
tree
is
thought
to
have
a
good
effect
on
the
newly
planted
yams
therefore
swinging
is
practised
by
old
and
young
by
men
and
women
no
one
who
has
an
interest
in
the
growth
of
his
crop
in
the
field
leaves
the
swing
idle
as
they
swing
to
and
fro
they
sing
these
songs
often
contain
only
the
names
of
the
kinds
of
yams
that
have
been
planted
together
with
the
joyous
repeated
with
variations
i
have
found
a
fine
fruit
in
leaping
from
the
swing
they
cry
by
calling
out
the
name
of
the
yams
they
think
to
draw
their
shoots
upwards
out
of
the
ground
a
small
bow
with
a
string
on
which
a
wooden
flag
adorned
with
a
feather
is
made
to
slide
down
the
kai
call
the
instrument
may
only
be
used
when
the
yams
are
beginning
to
wind
up
about
their
props
the
tender
shoots
are
then
touched
with
the
bow
while
a
song
is
sung
which
is
afterwards
often
repeated
in
the
village
it
runs
thus
gelo
gelowaineja
gelowaineja
kikí
tambai
kíki
the
meaning
of
the
words
is
unknown
the
intention
is
to
cause
a
strong
upward
growth
of
the
plants
in
order
that
the
foliage
of
the
yams
may
sprout
luxuriantly
and
grow
green
and
spread
the
kai
people
play
cat
s
cradle
each
of
the
intricate
figures
has
a
definite
meaning
and
a
name
to
match
for
example
the
flock
of
pigeons
the
star
the
flying
fox
the
fan
the
araucaria
the
lizard
and
the
dog
the
pig
the
in
the
fields
the
rat
s
nest
the
wasp
s
nest
in
the
the
kangaroo
the
spider
s
web
the
little
children
the
canoe
rain
and
sunshine
the
pig
s
pitfall
the
the
two
cousins
kewâ
and
imbiâwâ
carrying
their
dead
mother
to
the
grave
etc
by
spinning
large
native
acorns
or
a
sort
of
wild
fig
they
think
that
they
foster
the
growth
of
the
taro
the
plants
will
turn
about
and
the
game
must
therefore
only
be
played
at
the
time
when
the
taro
is
planted
the
same
holds
good
of
spearing
at
the
stalks
of
taro
leaves
with
the
ribs
of
sago
leaves
used
as
miniature
spears
this
is
done
when
the
taro
leaves
have
unfolded
themselves
but
when
the
plants
have
not
yet
set
any
tubers
a
single
leaf
is
cut
from
a
number
of
stems
and
these
leaves
are
brought
into
the
village
the
game
is
played
by
two
partners
who
sit
down
opposite
to
each
other
at
a
distance
of
three
or
four
paces
a
number
of
taro
stalks
lie
beside
each
he
who
has
speared
all
his
adversary
s
stalks
first
is
victor
then
they
change
stalks
and
the
game
begins
again
by
piercing
the
leaves
they
think
that
they
incite
the
plants
to
set
tubers
almost
more
remarkable
than
the
limitation
of
these
games
to
the
time
when
work
on
the
fields
is
going
forward
is
the
custom
of
the
kai
people
which
only
permits
the
tales
of
the
olden
time
or
popular
legends
to
be
told
at
the
time
when
the
newly
planted
fruits
are
budding
and
at
the
end
of
every
such
tale
the
kai
mentions
the
names
of
the
various
kinds
of
yams
and
adds
shoots
for
the
new
planting
and
fruits
to
eat
in
abundance
from
their
concluding
words
we
see
that
the
kai
legends
are
only
told
for
a
quite
definite
purpose
namely
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
yams
planted
in
the
field
by
reviving
the
memory
of
the
ancient
beings
to
whom
the
origin
of
the
is
referred
they
imagine
that
they
influence
the
growth
of
the
fruits
for
good
when
the
planting
is
over
and
especially
when
the
young
plants
begin
to
sprout
the
telling
of
legends
comes
to
an
end
in
the
villages
it
is
always
only
a
few
old
men
who
as
good
can
hold
the
attention
of
their
thus
with
these
new
guinea
people
the
playing
of
certain
games
and
the
recital
of
certain
legends
are
alike
magical
in
their
intention
they
are
charms
practised
to
ensure
good
crops
both
sets
of
charms
appear
to
be
based
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
in
playing
the
games
the
players
perform
acts
which
are
supposed
to
mimic
or
at
all
events
to
stimulate
the
corresponding
processes
in
the
plants
by
swinging
high
in
the
air
they
make
the
plants
grow
high
by
playing
cat
s
cradle
they
cause
the
leaves
of
the
yams
to
spread
and
the
stalks
to
intertwine
even
as
the
players
spread
their
hands
and
twine
the
string
about
their
fingers
by
spinning
fruits
they
make
the
taro
plants
to
turn
and
broaden
and
by
spearing
the
taro
leaves
they
induce
the
plants
to
set
tubers
in
telling
the
legends
the
mention
the
names
of
the
powerful
beings
who
first
created
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
the
mere
mention
of
their
names
avails
on
the
principle
of
the
magical
equivalence
of
names
and
persons
or
things
to
reproduce
the
effect
the
recitation
of
tales
as
a
charm
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
is
not
peculiar
to
the
kai
it
is
practised
also
by
the
bakaua
another
tribe
of
german
new
guinea
who
inhabit
the
coast
of
huon
gulf
not
far
from
the
kai
these
people
tell
stories
in
the
evening
at
the
time
when
the
yams
and
taro
are
ripe
and
the
stories
always
end
with
a
prayer
to
the
ancestral
spirits
invoked
under
various
more
or
less
figurative
designations
such
as
a
man
or
a
cricket
that
they
would
be
pleased
to
cause
countless
shoots
to
sprout
the
great
tubers
to
swell
the
to
thrive
and
the
bananas
to
hang
in
long
clusters
from
this
we
see
says
the
missionary
who
reports
the
custom
that
the
object
of
telling
the
stories
is
to
prove
to
the
ancestors
whose
spirits
are
believed
to
be
present
at
the
recitation
of
the
tales
which
they
either
invented
or
inherited
that
people
always
remember
them
for
which
reason
they
ought
to
be
favourable
to
their
descendants
and
above
all
to
bestow
their
blessings
on
the
shoots
which
are
ready
to
be
planted
or
on
the
plants
already
in
the
as
the
utters
the
prayer
he
looks
towards
the
house
in
which
the
young
shoots
ready
for
planting
or
the
ripe
fruits
are
deposited
similarly
the
yabim
a
neighbouring
tribe
of
german
new
guinea
at
the
entrance
to
huon
gulf
tell
tales
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
plentiful
harvest
of
yams
taro
and
bananas
they
subsist
chiefly
by
the
fruits
of
the
earth
which
they
cultivate
and
among
which
taro
yams
and
supply
them
with
their
staple
food
in
their
agricultural
labours
they
believe
themselves
to
be
largely
dependent
on
the
spirits
of
their
dead
the
as
they
call
them
before
they
plant
the
first
taro
in
a
newly
cleared
field
they
invoke
the
souls
of
the
dead
to
make
the
plants
grow
and
prosper
and
to
propitiate
these
powerful
spirits
they
bring
valuable
objects
such
as
boar
s
tusks
and
dog
s
teeth
into
the
field
in
order
that
the
ghosts
may
deck
themselves
with
the
souls
of
these
ornaments
while
at
the
same
time
they
minister
to
the
grosser
appetites
of
the
disembodied
spirits
by
offering
them
a
savoury
mess
of
taro
porridge
later
in
the
season
they
whirl
in
the
fields
and
call
out
the
names
of
the
dead
believing
that
this
makes
the
crops
to
thrive
but
besides
the
prayers
which
they
address
to
the
spirits
of
the
dead
for
the
sake
of
procuring
an
abundant
harvest
the
yabim
utter
spells
for
the
same
purpose
and
these
spells
sometimes
take
the
form
not
of
a
command
but
of
a
narrative
here
for
instance
is
one
of
their
spells
once
upon
a
time
a
man
laboured
in
his
field
and
complained
that
he
had
no
taro
shoots
then
came
two
doves
flying
from
poum
they
had
devoured
much
taro
and
they
perched
on
a
tree
in
the
field
and
during
the
night
they
vomited
all
the
taro
up
thus
the
man
got
so
many
taro
shoots
that
he
was
even
able
to
sell
some
of
them
to
other
or
again
if
the
taro
will
not
bud
the
yabim
will
have
recourse
to
the
following
spell
a
muraena
lay
at
on
the
shore
it
seemed
to
be
at
its
last
gasp
then
the
tide
flowed
on
and
the
muraena
came
to
life
again
and
plunged
into
the
deep
this
spell
is
pronounced
over
twigs
of
a
certain
tree
while
the
enchanter
smites
the
ground
with
them
after
that
the
taro
is
sure
to
bud
apparently
the
mere
recitation
of
such
simple
tales
is
thought
to
produce
the
same
effect
as
a
direct
appeal
whether
in
the
shape
of
a
prayer
or
a
command
addressed
to
the
spirits
such
incantations
may
be
called
narrative
spells
to
distinguish
them
from
the
more
familiar
imperative
spells
in
which
the
enchanter
expresses
his
wishes
in
the
form
of
direct
commands
much
use
seems
to
be
made
of
such
narrative
spells
among
the
natives
of
this
part
of
german
new
guinea
for
example
among
the
bukaua
who
attribute
practically
boundless
powers
to
sorcerers
in
every
department
of
life
and
nature
the
spells
by
which
these
wizards
attempt
to
work
their
will
assume
one
of
two
forms
either
they
are
requests
made
to
the
ancestors
or
they
are
short
narratives
addressed
to
nobody
in
particular
which
the
sorcerer
mutters
while
he
is
performing
his
magical
rites
it
is
true
that
here
the
distinction
is
drawn
between
narratives
and
requests
rather
than
between
narratives
and
commands
but
the
difference
of
a
request
from
a
command
though
great
in
theory
may
be
very
slight
in
practice
so
that
prayer
and
spell
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
words
may
melt
into
each
other
almost
imperceptibly
even
the
priest
or
the
enchanter
who
utters
the
one
may
be
hardly
conscious
of
the
hairbreadth
that
divides
it
from
the
other
in
regard
to
narrative
spells
it
seems
probable
that
they
have
been
used
much
more
extensively
among
mankind
than
the
evidence
at
our
disposal
permits
us
positively
to
affirm
in
particular
we
may
conjecture
that
many
ancient
narratives
which
we
have
been
accustomed
to
treat
as
mere
myths
used
to
be
regularly
recited
in
magical
rites
as
spells
for
the
purpose
of
actually
producing
events
like
those
which
they
describe
the
use
of
the
to
quicken
the
fruits
of
the
earth
is
not
peculiar
to
the
yabim
on
the
other
side
of
new
guinea
the
instrument
is
employed
for
the
same
purpose
by
the
natives
of
kiwai
an
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
fly
river
they
think
that
by
whirling
they
produce
good
crops
of
yams
sweet
potatoes
and
bananas
and
in
accordance
with
this
belief
they
call
the
implement
the
mother
of
similarly
in
mabuiag
an
island
in
torres
straits
the
is
looked
upon
as
an
instrument
that
can
be
used
to
promote
the
growth
of
garden
produce
such
as
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
certain
spirits
were
supposed
to
march
round
the
gardens
at
night
swinging
for
this
purpose
indeed
a
fertilising
or
prolific
virtue
appears
to
be
attributed
to
the
instrument
by
savages
who
are
totally
ignorant
of
agriculture
thus
among
the
dieri
of
central
australia
when
a
young
man
had
undergone
the
painful
initiatory
ceremony
of
having
a
number
of
gashes
cut
in
his
back
he
used
to
be
given
a
whereupon
it
was
believed
that
he
became
inspired
by
the
spirits
of
the
men
of
old
and
that
by
whirling
it
when
he
went
in
search
of
game
before
his
wounds
were
healed
he
had
power
to
cause
a
good
harvest
of
lizards
snakes
and
other
reptiles
on
the
other
hand
the
dieri
thought
that
if
a
woman
were
to
see
a
that
had
been
used
at
the
initiatory
ceremonies
and
to
learn
its
secret
the
tribe
would
ever
afterwards
be
destitute
of
snakes
lizards
and
other
such
food
it
may
very
well
be
that
a
similar
power
to
fertilise
or
multiply
edible
plants
and
animals
has
been
ascribed
to
the
by
many
other
peoples
who
employ
the
implement
in
their
mysteries
further
it
is
to
be
observed
that
just
as
the
kai
of
new
guinea
swing
to
and
fro
on
reeds
suspended
from
the
branches
of
trees
in
order
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
in
like
manner
lettish
peasants
in
russia
devote
their
leisure
to
swinging
in
spring
and
early
summer
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
the
flax
grow
as
high
as
they
swing
in
the
air
and
we
may
suspect
that
wherever
swinging
is
practised
as
a
ceremony
at
certain
times
of
the
year
particularly
in
spring
and
at
harvest
the
pastime
is
not
so
much
a
mere
popular
recreation
as
a
magical
rite
designed
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
with
these
examples
before
us
we
need
not
hesitate
to
believe
that
nieuwenhuis
is
right
when
he
attributes
a
deep
religious
or
magical
significance
to
the
games
which
the
kayans
or
bahaus
of
central
borneo
play
at
their
various
agricultural
festivals
it
remains
to
point
out
how
far
the
religious
or
magical
practices
of
these
primitive
agricultural
peoples
of
borneo
and
new
guinea
appear
to
illustrate
by
analogy
the
original
nature
of
the
rites
of
eleusis
so
far
as
we
can
recompose
from
the
broken
fragments
of
tradition
a
picture
of
the
religious
and
political
condition
of
the
eleusinian
people
in
the
olden
time
it
appears
to
tally
fairly
well
with
the
picture
which
nieuwenhuis
has
drawn
for
us
of
the
kayans
or
bahaus
at
the
present
day
in
the
forests
of
central
borneo
here
as
there
we
see
a
petty
agricultural
community
ruled
by
hereditary
chiefs
who
while
they
unite
religious
to
civil
authority
being
bound
to
preside
over
the
numerous
ceremonies
performed
for
the
good
of
the
crops
nevertheless
lead
simple
patriarchal
lives
and
are
so
little
raised
in
outward
dignity
above
their
fellows
that
their
daughters
do
not
deem
it
beneath
them
to
fetch
water
for
the
household
from
the
village
well
here
as
there
we
see
a
people
whose
whole
religion
is
dominated
and
coloured
by
the
main
occupation
of
their
lives
who
believe
that
the
growth
of
the
crops
on
which
they
depend
for
their
subsistence
is
at
the
mercy
of
two
powerful
spirits
a
divine
husband
and
his
wife
dwelling
in
a
subterranean
world
and
who
accordingly
offer
sacrifices
and
perform
ceremonies
in
order
to
ensure
the
favour
of
these
mighty
beings
and
so
to
obtain
abundant
harvests
if
we
knew
more
about
the
rarian
plain
at
eleusis
we
might
discover
that
it
was
the
scene
of
many
religious
ceremonies
like
those
which
are
performed
on
the
little
consecrated
the
of
the
kayans
where
the
various
operations
of
the
agricultural
year
are
performed
in
miniature
by
members
of
the
chief
s
family
before
the
corresponding
operations
may
be
performed
on
a
larger
scale
by
common
folk
on
their
fields
certainly
we
know
that
the
rarian
plain
witnessed
one
such
ceremony
in
the
year
it
was
a
solemn
ceremony
of
ploughing
one
of
the
three
sacred
ploughings
which
took
place
annually
in
various
parts
of
attica
probably
the
rite
formed
part
of
the
or
festival
before
ploughing
which
was
intended
to
ensure
a
plentiful
crop
further
it
appears
that
the
priests
who
guided
the
sacred
oxen
as
they
dragged
the
plough
down
the
furrows
of
the
rarian
plain
were
drawn
from
the
old
priestly
family
of
bouzygai
or
whose
eponymous
ancestor
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
man
to
yoke
oxen
and
to
plough
the
fields
as
they
performed
this
ceremony
the
priests
uttered
many
quaint
curses
against
all
churls
who
should
refuse
to
lend
fire
or
water
to
neighbours
or
to
shew
the
way
to
wanderers
or
who
should
leave
a
corpse
unburied
if
we
had
a
complete
list
of
the
execrations
fulminated
by
the
holy
ploughmen
on
these
occasions
we
might
find
that
some
of
them
were
levelled
at
the
impious
wretches
who
failed
to
keep
all
the
rules
of
the
sabbath
as
we
may
call
those
periods
of
enforced
rest
and
seclusion
which
the
kayans
of
borneo
and
other
primitive
agricultural
peoples
observe
for
the
good
of
the
crops
further
when
we
see
that
many
primitive
peoples
practise
what
we
call
games
but
what
they
regard
in
all
seriousness
as
solemn
rites
for
the
good
of
the
crops
we
may
be
the
more
inclined
to
accept
the
view
of
the
ancients
who
associated
the
eleusinian
games
directly
with
the
worship
of
demeter
and
persephone
the
corn
goddesses
one
of
the
contests
at
the
eleusinian
games
was
in
leaping
and
we
know
that
even
in
modern
europe
to
this
day
leaping
or
dancing
high
is
practised
as
a
charm
to
make
the
crops
grow
tall
again
the
was
swung
so
as
to
produce
a
humming
sound
at
the
greek
mysteries
and
when
we
find
the
same
simple
instrument
whirled
by
savages
in
new
guinea
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
good
crops
we
may
reasonably
conjecture
that
it
was
whirled
with
a
like
intention
by
the
rude
forefathers
of
the
greeks
among
the
cornfields
of
eleusis
if
that
were
the
conjecture
is
hardly
susceptible
of
would
go
some
way
to
confirm
the
theory
that
the
eleusinian
mysteries
were
in
their
origin
nothing
more
than
simple
rustic
ceremonies
designed
to
make
the
farmer
s
fields
to
wave
with
yellow
corn
and
in
the
practice
of
the
kayans
whose
worship
of
the
rice
offers
many
analogies
to
the
eleusinian
worship
of
the
corn
may
we
not
detect
a
hint
of
the
origin
of
that
rule
of
secrecy
which
always
characterised
the
eleusinian
mysteries
may
it
not
have
been
that
just
as
the
kayans
exclude
strangers
from
their
villages
while
they
are
engaged
in
the
celebration
of
religious
rites
lest
the
presence
of
these
intruders
should
frighten
or
annoy
the
shy
and
touchy
spirits
who
are
invoked
at
these
times
so
the
old
eleusinians
may
have
debarred
foreigners
from
participation
in
their
most
solemn
ceremonies
lest
the
coy
goddesses
of
the
corn
should
take
fright
or
offence
at
the
sight
of
strange
faces
and
so
refuse
to
bestow
on
men
their
annual
blessing
the
admission
of
foreigners
to
the
privilege
of
initiation
in
the
mysteries
was
probably
a
late
innovation
introduced
at
a
time
when
the
fame
of
their
sanctity
had
spread
far
and
wide
and
when
the
old
magical
meaning
of
the
ritual
had
long
been
obscured
if
not
forgotten
lastly
it
may
be
suggested
that
in
the
masked
dances
and
dramatic
performances
which
form
a
conspicuous
and
popular
feature
of
the
sowing
festival
among
the
kayans
we
have
the
savage
counterpart
of
that
drama
of
divine
death
and
resurrection
which
appears
to
have
figured
so
prominently
in
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
if
my
interpretation
of
that
solemn
drama
is
correct
it
represented
in
mythical
guise
the
various
stages
in
the
growth
of
the
corn
for
the
purpose
of
magically
fostering
the
natural
processes
which
it
simulated
in
like
manner
among
the
kaua
and
kobeua
indians
of
brazil
who
subsist
chiefly
by
the
cultivation
of
manioc
dances
or
rather
pantomimes
are
performed
by
masked
men
who
represent
spirits
or
demons
of
fertility
and
by
imitating
the
act
of
procreation
are
believed
to
stimulate
the
growth
of
plants
as
well
as
to
quicken
the
wombs
of
women
and
to
promote
the
multiplication
of
animals
coarse
and
grotesque
as
these
dramatic
performances
may
seem
to
us
they
convey
no
suggestion
of
indecency
to
the
minds
either
of
the
actors
or
of
the
spectators
who
regard
them
in
all
seriousness
as
rites
destined
to
confer
the
blessing
of
fruitfulness
on
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
on
their
plantations
and
on
the
whole
realm
of
nature
however
we
possess
so
little
exact
information
as
to
the
rites
of
eleusis
that
all
attempts
to
elucidate
them
by
the
ritual
of
savages
must
necessarily
be
conjectural
yet
the
candid
reader
may
be
willing
to
grant
that
conjectures
supported
by
analogies
like
the
foregoing
do
not
exceed
the
limits
of
a
reasonable
hypothesis
chapter
iv
woman
s
part
in
primitive
agriculture
if
demeter
was
indeed
a
personification
of
the
corn
it
is
natural
to
ask
why
did
the
greeks
personify
the
corn
as
a
goddess
rather
than
a
god
why
did
they
ascribe
the
origin
of
agriculture
to
a
female
rather
than
to
a
male
power
they
conceived
the
spirit
of
the
vine
as
masculine
why
did
they
conceive
the
spirit
of
the
barley
and
wheat
as
feminine
to
this
it
has
been
answered
that
the
personification
of
the
corn
as
feminine
or
at
all
events
the
ascription
of
the
discovery
of
agriculture
to
a
goddess
was
suggested
by
the
prominent
part
which
women
take
in
primitive
agriculture
the
theory
illustrates
a
recent
tendency
of
mythologists
to
explain
many
myths
as
reflections
of
primitive
society
rather
than
as
personifications
of
nature
for
that
reason
apart
from
its
intrinsic
interest
the
theory
deserves
to
be
briefly
considered
before
the
invention
of
the
plough
which
can
hardly
be
worked
without
resort
to
the
labour
of
men
it
was
and
still
is
customary
in
many
parts
of
the
world
to
break
up
the
soil
for
cultivation
with
hoes
and
among
not
a
few
savage
peoples
to
this
day
the
task
of
hoeing
the
ground
and
sowing
the
seed
devolves
mainly
or
entirely
upon
the
women
while
the
men
take
little
or
no
part
in
cultivation
beyond
clearing
the
land
by
felling
the
forest
trees
and
burning
the
fallen
timber
and
brushwood
which
encumber
the
soil
thus
for
example
among
the
zulus
when
a
piece
of
land
has
been
selected
for
cultivation
the
task
of
clearing
it
belongs
to
the
men
if
the
ground
be
much
encumbered
this
becomes
a
laborious
undertaking
for
their
axe
is
very
small
and
when
a
large
tree
has
to
be
encountered
they
can
only
lop
the
branches
fire
is
employed
when
it
is
needful
to
remove
the
trunk
the
reader
will
therefore
not
be
surprised
that
the
people
usually
avoid
though
they
seem
to
be
aware
of
its
superior
fertility
as
a
general
rule
the
men
take
no
further
share
in
the
labour
of
cultivation
and
as
the
site
chosen
is
seldom
much
encumbered
and
frequently
bears
nothing
but
grass
their
part
of
the
work
is
very
slight
the
women
are
the
real
labourers
for
except
in
some
particular
cases
the
entire
business
of
digging
planting
and
weeding
devolves
on
them
and
if
we
regard
the
assagai
and
shield
as
symbolical
of
the
man
the
hoe
may
be
looked
upon
as
emblematic
of
the
woman
with
this
rude
and
heavy
instrument
the
woman
digs
plants
and
weeds
her
garden
digging
and
sowing
are
generally
one
operation
which
is
thus
performed
the
seed
is
first
scattered
on
the
ground
when
the
soil
is
dug
or
picked
up
with
the
hoe
to
the
depth
of
three
or
four
inches
the
larger
roots
and
tufts
of
grass
being
gathered
out
but
all
the
rest
left
in
or
on
the
a
special
term
of
contempt
is
applied
to
any
zulu
man
who
deprived
of
the
services
of
his
wife
and
family
is
compelled
by
hard
necessity
to
handle
the
hoe
himself
similarly
among
the
baronga
of
delagoa
bay
when
the
rains
begin
to
fall
sometimes
as
early
as
september
but
generally
later
they
hasten
to
sow
with
her
hoe
in
her
hands
the
mistress
of
the
field
walks
with
little
steps
every
time
she
lifts
a
clod
of
earth
well
broken
up
and
in
the
hole
thus
made
she
plants
three
or
four
grains
of
maize
and
covers
them
up
if
she
has
not
finished
clearing
all
the
patch
of
the
bush
which
she
contemplated
she
proceeds
to
turn
up
again
the
fields
she
tilled
last
year
the
crop
will
be
less
abundant
than
in
virgin
soil
but
they
plant
three
or
four
years
successively
in
the
same
field
before
it
is
exhausted
as
for
enriching
the
soil
with
manure
they
never
think
of
among
the
barotsé
who
cultivate
millet
maize
and
peas
to
a
small
extent
and
in
a
rudimentary
fashion
women
alone
are
occupied
with
the
and
their
only
implement
is
a
spade
or
hoe
of
the
matabelé
we
are
told
that
most
of
the
hard
work
is
performed
by
the
women
the
whole
of
the
cultivation
is
done
by
them
they
plough
with
short
spades
of
native
manufacture
they
sow
the
fields
and
they
clear
them
of
among
the
awemba
to
the
west
of
lake
tanganyika
the
bulk
of
the
work
in
the
plantations
falls
on
the
women
in
particular
the
men
refuse
to
hoe
the
ground
they
have
a
saying
is
not
each
male
child
born
for
the
axe
and
each
female
child
for
the
hoe
the
natives
of
the
tanganyika
plateau
cultivate
the
banana
and
have
a
curious
custom
connected
with
it
no
man
is
permitted
to
sow
but
when
the
hole
is
prepared
a
little
girl
is
carried
to
the
spot
on
a
man
s
shoulders
she
first
throws
into
the
hole
a
sherd
of
broken
pottery
and
then
scatters
the
seed
over
the
reason
of
the
latter
practice
has
been
explained
by
more
recent
observers
of
these
natives
young
children
it
may
here
be
noted
are
often
employed
to
administer
drugs
remedies
even
the
poison
ordeal
and
to
sow
the
first
seeds
such
acts
the
natives
say
must
be
performed
by
chaste
and
innocent
hands
lest
a
contaminated
touch
should
destroy
the
potency
of
the
medicine
or
of
the
seedlings
planted
it
used
to
be
a
very
common
sight
upon
the
islands
of
lake
bangweolo
to
watch
how
a
bisa
woman
would
solve
the
problem
of
her
own
moral
unfitness
by
carrying
her
to
the
and
inserting
seedlings
in
the
tiny
hands
for
dropping
into
the
holes
already
similarly
among
the
people
of
the
lower
congo
women
must
remain
chaste
while
planting
pumpkin
and
calabash
seeds
they
are
not
allowed
to
touch
any
and
they
must
wash
their
hands
before
touching
the
seeds
if
a
woman
does
not
observe
all
these
rules
she
must
not
plant
the
seeds
or
the
crop
will
be
bad
she
may
make
the
holes
and
her
baby
girl
or
another
who
has
obeyed
the
restrictions
can
drop
in
the
seeds
and
cover
them
we
can
now
perhaps
understand
why
attic
matrons
had
to
observe
strict
chastity
when
they
celebrated
the
festival
of
the
thesmophoria
in
attica
that
festival
was
held
in
honour
of
demeter
in
the
month
of
pyanepsion
corresponding
to
october
the
season
of
the
autumn
sowing
and
the
rites
included
certain
ceremonies
which
bore
directly
on
the
quickening
of
the
seed
we
may
conjecture
that
the
rule
of
chastity
imposed
on
matrons
at
this
festival
was
a
relic
of
a
time
when
they
too
like
many
savage
women
down
to
the
present
time
discharged
the
important
duty
of
sowing
the
seed
and
were
bound
for
that
reason
to
observe
strict
continence
lest
any
impurity
on
their
part
should
defile
the
seed
and
prevent
it
from
bearing
fruit
of
the
caffres
of
south
africa
in
general
we
read
that
agriculture
is
mainly
the
work
of
the
women
for
in
olden
days
the
men
were
occupied
in
hunting
and
fighting
the
women
do
but
scratch
the
land
with
hoes
sometimes
using
instruments
as
in
zululand
and
sometimes
ones
as
above
the
zambesi
when
the
ground
is
thus
prepared
the
women
scatter
the
seed
throwing
it
over
the
soil
quite
at
random
they
know
the
time
to
sow
by
the
position
of
the
constellations
chiefly
by
that
of
the
pleiades
they
date
their
new
year
from
the
time
they
can
see
this
constellation
just
before
in
basutoland
where
the
women
also
till
the
fields
though
the
lands
of
chiefs
are
dug
and
sowed
by
men
an
attempt
is
made
to
determine
the
time
of
sowing
by
observation
of
the
moon
but
the
people
generally
find
themselves
out
in
their
reckoning
and
after
much
dispute
are
forced
to
fall
back
upon
the
state
of
the
weather
and
of
vegetation
as
better
evidence
of
the
season
of
sowing
intelligent
chiefs
rectify
the
calendar
at
the
summer
solstice
which
they
call
the
of
the
sun
among
the
nandi
of
british
east
africa
the
rough
work
of
clearing
the
bush
for
plantations
is
performed
by
the
men
after
which
nearly
all
work
in
connexion
with
them
is
done
by
the
women
the
men
however
assist
in
sowing
the
seed
and
in
harvesting
some
of
the
crops
as
a
rule
trees
are
not
felled
but
the
bark
is
stripped
off
for
about
four
feet
from
the
ground
and
the
trees
are
then
left
to
die
the
planting
is
mostly
if
not
entirely
done
during
the
first
half
of
the
moon
february
which
is
the
first
month
of
the
year
and
when
the
moon
rises
march
all
seed
should
be
in
the
ground
the
chief
medicine
man
is
consulted
before
the
planting
operations
begin
but
the
nandi
know
by
the
arrival
in
the
fields
of
the
whose
song
is
supposed
to
be
plant
plant
there
is
luck
in
it
that
the
planting
season
is
at
hand
when
the
first
seed
is
sown
salt
is
mixed
with
it
and
the
sower
sings
mournfully
and
grow
quickly
as
he
sows
after
fresh
ground
has
been
cleared
eleusine
grain
is
planted
this
crop
is
generally
repeated
the
second
year
after
which
millet
is
sown
and
finally
sweet
potatoes
or
some
other
product
most
fields
are
allowed
to
lie
fallow
every
fourth
or
fifth
year
the
nandi
manure
their
plantations
with
turf
ashes
the
eleusine
crops
are
harvested
by
both
men
and
women
all
other
crops
are
reaped
by
the
women
only
who
are
at
times
assisted
by
the
children
the
corn
is
pounded
and
winnowed
by
the
women
and
among
the
suk
and
of
british
east
africa
it
is
the
women
who
cultivate
the
fields
and
milk
the
cows
among
the
wadowe
of
german
east
africa
the
men
clear
the
forest
and
break
up
the
hard
ground
but
the
women
sow
and
reap
the
crops
so
among
the
wanyamwezi
who
are
an
essentially
agricultural
people
to
the
south
of
lake
victoria
nyanza
the
men
cut
down
the
bush
and
hoe
the
hard
ground
but
leave
the
rest
of
the
labour
of
weeding
sowing
and
reaping
to
the
women
the
baganda
of
central
africa
subsist
chiefly
on
bananas
and
among
them
the
garden
and
its
cultivation
have
always
been
the
woman
s
department
princesses
and
peasant
women
alike
looked
upon
cultivation
as
their
special
work
the
garden
with
its
produce
was
essentially
the
wife
s
domain
and
she
would
under
no
circumstances
allow
her
husband
to
do
any
digging
or
sowing
in
it
no
woman
would
remain
with
a
man
who
did
not
give
her
a
garden
and
a
hoe
to
dig
it
with
if
these
were
denied
her
she
would
seek
an
early
opportunity
to
escape
from
her
husband
and
return
to
her
relations
to
complain
of
her
treatment
and
to
obtain
justice
or
a
divorce
when
a
man
married
he
sought
a
plot
of
land
for
his
wife
in
order
that
she
might
settle
to
work
and
provide
food
for
the
household
in
initial
clearing
of
the
land
it
was
customary
for
the
husband
to
take
part
he
cut
down
the
tall
grass
and
shrubs
and
so
left
the
ground
ready
for
his
wife
to
begin
her
digging
the
grass
and
the
trees
she
heaped
up
and
burned
reserving
only
so
much
as
she
needed
for
firewood
a
hoe
was
the
only
implement
used
in
cultivation
the
blade
was
with
a
prong
at
the
base
by
which
it
was
fastened
to
the
handle
the
was
never
more
than
two
feet
long
so
that
a
woman
had
to
stoop
when
using
in
kiziba
a
district
immediately
to
the
south
of
uganda
the
tilling
of
the
soil
is
exclusively
the
work
of
the
women
they
turn
up
the
soil
with
hoes
make
holes
in
the
ground
with
or
their
fingers
and
drop
a
few
seeds
into
each
hole
among
the
of
central
africa
the
men
most
studiously
devote
themselves
to
their
hunting
and
leave
the
culture
of
the
soil
to
be
carried
on
exclusively
by
the
women
and
among
the
monbuttoo
of
the
same
region
in
like
manner
whilst
the
women
attend
to
the
tillage
of
the
soil
and
the
gathering
of
the
harvest
the
men
unless
they
are
absent
either
for
war
or
hunting
spend
the
entire
day
in
as
to
the
bangala
of
the
upper
congo
we
read
that
large
farms
were
made
around
the
towns
the
men
did
the
clearing
of
the
bush
felling
the
trees
and
cutting
down
the
undergrowth
the
women
worked
with
them
heaping
up
the
grass
and
brushwood
ready
for
burning
and
helping
generally
as
a
rule
the
women
did
the
hoeing
planting
and
weeding
but
the
men
did
not
so
despise
this
work
as
never
to
do
in
this
tribe
the
food
belonged
to
the
woman
who
cultivated
the
farm
and
while
she
supplied
her
husband
with
the
vegetable
food
he
had
to
supply
the
fish
and
meat
and
share
them
with
his
wife
or
amongst
the
tofoke
a
tribe
of
the
congo
state
on
the
equator
all
the
field
labour
except
the
clearing
away
of
the
forest
is
performed
by
the
women
they
dig
the
soil
with
a
hoe
and
plant
maize
and
manioc
a
field
is
used
only
once
so
with
the
a
bantu
tribe
between
the
rivers
inzia
and
kwilu
the
men
clear
the
ground
for
cultivation
but
all
the
rest
of
the
work
of
tillage
falls
to
the
women
whose
only
tool
is
an
iron
hoe
fresh
ground
is
cleared
for
cultivation
every
year
the
mpongwe
of
the
gaboon
in
west
africa
cultivate
manioc
cassava
maize
yams
plantains
sweet
potatoes
and
ground
nuts
when
new
clearings
have
to
be
made
in
the
forest
the
men
cut
down
and
burn
the
trees
and
the
women
put
in
the
crop
the
only
tool
they
use
is
a
dibble
with
which
they
turn
up
a
sod
put
in
a
seed
and
cover
it
over
among
the
ashira
of
the
same
region
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
is
in
the
hands
of
the
women
a
similar
division
of
labour
between
men
and
women
prevails
among
many
primitive
agricultural
tribes
of
indians
in
south
america
in
the
interior
of
the
villages
says
an
eminent
authority
on
aboriginal
south
america
the
man
often
absents
himself
to
hunt
or
to
go
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
in
search
of
the
honey
of
the
wild
bees
and
he
always
goes
alone
he
fells
the
trees
in
the
places
where
he
wishes
to
make
a
field
for
cultivation
he
fashions
his
weapons
he
digs
out
his
canoe
while
the
woman
rears
the
children
makes
the
garments
busies
herself
with
the
interior
cultivates
the
field
gathers
the
fruits
collects
the
roots
and
prepares
the
food
such
is
generally
at
least
the
respective
condition
of
the
two
sexes
among
almost
all
the
americans
the
peruvians
alone
had
already
in
their
state
partially
modified
these
customs
for
among
them
the
man
shared
the
toils
of
the
other
sex
or
took
on
himself
the
most
laborious
thus
to
take
examples
among
the
caribs
of
the
west
indies
the
men
used
to
fell
the
trees
and
leave
the
fallen
trunks
to
cumber
the
ground
burning
off
only
the
smaller
boughs
then
the
women
came
and
planted
manioc
potatoes
yams
and
bananas
wherever
they
found
room
among
the
in
digging
the
ground
to
receive
the
seed
or
the
shoots
they
did
not
use
hoes
but
simply
pointed
sticks
the
men
we
are
told
would
rather
have
died
of
hunger
than
undertake
such
agricultural
labours
again
the
staple
vegetable
food
of
the
indians
of
british
guiana
is
cassava
bread
made
from
the
roots
of
the
manioc
or
cassava
plant
which
the
indians
cultivate
in
clearings
of
the
forest
the
men
fell
the
trees
cut
down
the
undergrowth
and
in
dry
weather
set
fire
to
the
fallen
lumber
thus
creating
open
patches
in
the
forest
which
are
covered
with
white
ashes
when
the
rains
set
in
the
women
repair
to
these
clearings
heavily
laden
with
baskets
full
of
cassava
sticks
to
be
used
as
cuttings
these
they
insert
at
irregular
intervals
in
the
soil
and
so
the
field
is
formed
while
the
cassava
is
growing
the
women
do
just
as
much
weeding
as
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
cultivated
plants
from
being
choked
by
the
rank
growth
of
the
tropical
vegetation
and
in
doing
so
they
plant
bananas
pumpkin
seeds
yams
sweet
potatoes
red
and
yellow
peppers
and
so
forth
wherever
there
is
room
for
them
at
last
in
the
ninth
or
tenth
month
when
the
seeds
appearing
on
the
straggling
branches
of
the
cassava
plants
announce
that
the
roots
are
ripe
the
women
cut
down
the
plants
and
dig
up
the
roots
not
all
at
once
but
as
they
are
required
these
roots
they
afterwards
peel
scrape
and
bake
into
cassava
bread
in
like
manner
the
cassava
or
manioc
plant
is
cultivated
generally
among
all
the
indian
tribes
of
tropical
south
america
wherever
the
plant
will
grow
and
the
cultivation
of
it
is
altogether
in
the
hands
of
the
women
who
insert
the
sticks
in
the
ground
after
the
fashion
already
described
for
example
among
the
tribes
of
the
uaupes
river
in
the
upper
valley
of
the
amazon
who
are
an
agricultural
people
with
settled
abodes
the
men
cut
down
the
trees
and
brushwood
which
after
they
have
lain
some
months
to
dry
are
burnt
and
the
mandiocca
is
then
planted
by
the
women
together
with
little
patches
of
cane
sweet
potatoes
and
various
fruits
the
women
also
dig
up
the
mandiocca
and
prepare
from
it
the
bread
which
is
their
main
subsistence
the
bread
is
made
fresh
every
day
as
when
it
gets
cold
and
dry
it
is
far
less
palatable
the
women
thus
have
plenty
to
do
for
every
other
day
at
least
they
have
to
go
to
the
field
often
a
mile
or
two
distant
to
fetch
the
root
and
every
day
to
grate
prepare
and
bake
the
bread
as
it
forms
by
far
the
greater
part
of
their
food
and
they
often
pass
days
without
eating
anything
else
especially
when
the
men
are
engaged
in
clearing
the
among
the
tupinambas
a
tribe
of
brazilian
indians
the
wives
had
something
more
than
their
due
share
of
labour
but
they
were
not
treated
with
brutality
and
their
condition
was
on
the
whole
happy
they
set
and
dug
the
mandioc
they
sowed
and
gathered
the
maize
an
odd
superstition
prevailed
that
if
a
sort
of
which
the
portugueze
call
was
planted
by
the
men
it
would
not
similar
accounts
appear
to
apply
to
the
brazilian
indians
in
general
the
men
occupy
themselves
with
hunting
war
and
the
manufacture
of
their
weapons
while
the
women
plant
and
reap
the
crops
and
search
for
fruits
in
the
forest
above
all
they
cultivate
the
manioc
scraping
the
soil
clear
of
weeds
with
pointed
sticks
and
inserting
the
shoots
in
the
earth
similarly
among
the
indians
of
peru
who
cultivate
maize
in
clearings
of
the
forest
the
cultivation
of
the
fields
is
left
to
the
women
while
the
men
hunt
with
bows
and
arrows
and
blowguns
in
the
woods
often
remaining
away
from
home
for
weeks
or
even
months
together
a
similar
distribution
of
labour
between
the
sexes
prevails
among
some
savage
tribes
in
other
parts
of
the
world
thus
among
the
lhoosai
of
india
the
men
employ
themselves
chiefly
in
hunting
or
in
making
forays
on
their
weaker
neighbours
but
they
clear
the
ground
and
help
to
carry
home
the
harvest
however
the
main
burden
of
the
bodily
labour
by
which
life
is
supported
falls
on
the
women
they
fetch
water
hew
wood
cultivate
the
ground
and
help
to
reap
the
crops
among
the
miris
of
assam
almost
the
whole
of
the
field
work
is
done
by
the
women
they
cultivate
a
patch
of
ground
for
two
successive
years
then
suffer
it
to
lie
fallow
for
four
or
five
but
they
are
deterred
by
superstitious
fear
from
breaking
new
ground
so
long
as
the
fallow
suffices
for
their
needs
they
dread
to
offend
the
spirits
of
the
woods
by
needlessly
felling
the
trees
they
raise
crops
of
rice
maize
millet
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
but
they
seldom
possess
any
implement
adapted
solely
for
tillage
they
have
never
taken
to
the
plough
nor
even
to
a
hoe
they
use
their
long
straight
swords
to
clear
cut
and
dig
with
among
the
korwas
a
savage
hill
tribe
of
bengal
the
men
hunt
with
bows
and
arrows
while
the
women
till
the
fields
dig
for
wild
roots
or
cull
wild
vegetables
their
principal
crop
is
pulse
among
the
papuans
of
ayambori
near
doreh
in
dutch
new
guinea
it
is
the
men
who
lay
out
the
fields
by
felling
and
burning
the
trees
and
brushwood
in
the
forest
and
it
is
they
who
enclose
the
fields
with
fences
but
it
is
the
women
who
sow
and
reap
them
and
carry
home
the
produce
in
sacks
on
their
backs
they
cultivate
rice
millet
and
bananas
so
among
the
natives
of
kaimani
bay
in
dutch
new
guinea
the
men
occupy
themselves
only
with
fishing
and
hunting
while
all
the
field
work
falls
on
the
women
in
the
gazelle
peninsula
of
new
britain
when
the
natives
have
decided
to
convert
a
piece
of
into
a
plantation
the
men
cut
down
the
long
grass
burn
it
dig
up
the
soil
with
sticks
and
enclose
the
land
with
a
fence
of
saplings
then
the
women
plant
the
banana
shoots
weed
the
ground
and
in
the
intervals
between
the
bananas
insert
slips
of
yams
sweet
potatoes
or
ginger
when
the
produce
is
ripe
they
carry
it
to
the
village
thus
the
bulk
of
the
labour
of
cultivation
devolves
on
the
women
among
some
peoples
of
the
indian
archipelago
after
the
land
has
been
cleared
for
cultivation
by
the
men
the
work
of
planting
and
sowing
is
divided
between
men
and
women
the
men
digging
holes
in
the
ground
with
pointed
sticks
and
the
women
following
them
putting
the
seeds
or
shoots
into
the
holes
and
then
huddling
the
earth
over
them
for
savages
seldom
sow
broadcast
they
laboriously
dig
holes
and
insert
the
seed
in
them
this
division
of
agricultural
labour
between
the
sexes
is
adopted
by
various
tribes
of
celebes
ceram
borneo
nias
and
new
guinea
sometimes
the
custom
of
entrusting
the
sowing
of
the
seed
to
women
appears
to
be
influenced
by
superstitious
as
well
as
economic
considerations
thus
among
the
indians
of
the
orinoco
who
with
an
infinitude
of
pains
cleared
the
jungle
for
cultivation
by
cutting
down
the
forest
trees
with
their
stone
axes
burning
the
fallen
lumber
and
breaking
up
the
ground
with
wooden
instruments
hardened
in
the
fire
the
task
of
sowing
the
maize
and
planting
the
roots
was
performed
by
the
women
alone
and
when
the
spanish
missionaries
expostulated
with
the
men
for
not
helping
their
wives
in
this
toilsome
duty
they
received
for
answer
that
as
women
knew
how
to
conceive
seed
and
bear
children
so
the
seeds
and
roots
planted
by
them
bore
fruit
far
more
abundantly
than
if
they
had
been
planted
by
male
hands
even
among
savages
who
have
not
yet
learned
to
cultivate
any

the
task
of
collecting
the
edible
seeds
and
digging
up
the
edible
roots
of
wild
plants
appears
to
devolve
mainly
on
women
while
the
men
contribute
their
share
to
the
common
food
supply
by
hunting
and
fishing
for
which
their
superior
strength
agility
and
courage
especially
qualify
them
for
example
among
the
indians
of
california
who
were
entirely
ignorant
of
agriculture
the
general
division
of
labour
between
the
sexes
in
the
search
for
food
was
that
the
men
killed
the
game
and
caught
the
salmon
while
the
women
dug
the
roots
and
brought
in
most
of
the
vegetable
food
though
the
men
helped
them
to
gather
acorns
nuts
and
berries
among
the
indians
of
san
juan
capistrano
in
california
while
the
men
passed
their
time
in
fowling
fishing
dancing
and
lounging
the
women
were
obliged
to
gather
seeds
in
the
fields
prepare
them
for
cooking
and
to
perform
all
the
meanest
offices
as
well
as
the
most
laborious
it
was
painful
in
the
extreme
to
behold
them
with
their
infants
hanging
upon
their
shoulders
groping
about
in
search
of
herbs
or
seeds
and
exposed
as
they
frequently
were
to
the
inclemency
of
the
yet
these
rude
savages
possessed
a
calendar
containing
directions
as
to
the
seasons
for
collecting
the
different
seeds
and
produce
of
the
earth
the
calendar
consisted
of
lunar
months
corrected
by
observation
of
the
solstices
for
at
the
conclusion
of
the
moon
in
december
that
is
at
the
conjunction
they
calculated
the
return
of
the
sun
from
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
another
year
commenced
the
indian
saying
the
sun
has
arrived
at
his
they
observed
with
greater
attention
and
celebrated
with
more
pomp
the
sun
s
arrival
at
the
tropic
of
capricorn
than
they
did
his
reaching
the
tropic
of
cancer
for
the
reason
that
as
they
were
situated
ten
degrees
from
the
latter
they
were
pleased
at
the
sun
s
approach
towards
them
for
it
returned
to
ripen
their
fruits
and
seeds
to
give
warmth
to
the
atmosphere
and
enliven
again
the
fields
with
beauty
and
however
the
knowledge
of
the
calendar
was
limited
to
the
or
general
council
of
the
tribe
who
sent
criers
to
make
proclamation
when
the
time
had
come
to
go
forth
and
gather
the
seeds
and
other
produce
of
the
earth
in
their
calculations
they
were
assisted
by
a
or
astrologer
who
observed
the
aspect
of
the
moon
when
we
consider
that
these
rude
californian
savages
destitute
alike
of
agriculture
and
of
the
other
arts
of
civilised
life
yet
succeeded
in
forming
for
themselves
a
calendar
based
on
observation
both
of
the
moon
and
of
the
sun
we
need
not
hesitate
to
ascribe
to
the
immeasurably
more
advanced
greeks
at
the
dawn
of
history
the
knowledge
of
a
somewhat
more
elaborate
calendar
founded
on
a
cycle
of
eight
solar
years
among
the
equally
rude
aborigines
of
australia
to
whom
agriculture
in
every
form
was
totally
unknown
the
division
of
labour
between
the
sexes
in
regard
to
the
collection
of
food
appears
to
have
been
similar
while
the
men
hunted
game
the
labour
of
gathering
and
preparing
the
vegetable
food
fell
chiefly
to
the
women
thus
with
regard
to
the
encounter
bay
tribe
of
south
australia
we
are
told
that
while
the
men
busied
themselves
according
to
the
season
either
with
fishing
or
with
hunting
emus
opossums
kangaroos
and
so
forth
the
women
and
children
searched
for
roots
and
plants
again
among
the
natives
of
western
australia
it
is
generally
considered
the
province
of
women
to
dig
roots
and
for
this
purpose
they
carry
a
long
pointed
stick
which
is
held
in
the
right
hand
and
driven
firmly
into
the
ground
where
it
is
shaken
so
as
to
loosen
the
earth
which
is
scooped
up
and
thrown
out
with
the
fingers
of
the
left
hand
and
in
this
manner
they
dig
with
great
rapidity
but
the
labour
in
proportion
to
the
amount
obtained
is
great
to
get
a
yam
about
half
an
inch
in
circumference
and
a
foot
in
length
they
have
to
dig
a
hole
above
a
foot
square
and
two
feet
in
depth
a
considerable
portion
of
the
time
of
the
women
and
children
is
therefore
passed
in
this
employment
if
the
men
are
absent
upon
any
expedition
the
females
are
left
in
charge
of
one
who
is
old
or
sick
and
in
traversing
the
bush
you
often
stumble
on
a
large
party
of
them
scattered
about
in
the
forest
digging
roots
and
collecting
the
different
species
of
in
fertile
districts
where
the
yams
which
the
aborigines
use
as
food
grow
abundantly
the
ground
may
sometimes
be
seen
riddled
with
holes
made
by
the
women
in
their
search
for
these
edible
roots
thus
to
quote
sir
george
grey
we
now
crossed
the
dry
bed
of
a
stream
and
from
that
emerged
upon
a
tract
of
light
fertile
soil
quite
overrun
with
yam
plants
the
root
of
which
is
a
favourite
article
of
food
with
the
natives
this
was
the
first
time
we
had
yet
seen
this
plant
on
our
journey
and
now
for
three
and
a
half
consecutive
miles
we
traversed
a
fertile
piece
of
land
literally
perforated
with
the
holes
the
natives
had
made
to
dig
this
root
indeed
we
could
with
difficulty
walk
across
it
on
that
account
whilst
this
tract
extended
east
and
west
as
far
as
we
could
again
in
the
valley
of
the
lower
murray
river
a
kind
of
yam
grew
plentifully
and
was
easily
found
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
when
the
roots
were
dug
up
out
of
the
earth
by
the
women
and
children
the
root
is
small
and
of
a
sweetish
taste
and
grows
throughout
the
greater
part
of
australia
outside
the
tropics
on
the
alpine
pastures
of
the
high
australian
mountains
it
attains
to
a
much
larger
size
and
furnishes
a
not
unpalatable
food
but
the
women
gather
edible
herbs
and
seeds
as
well
as
roots
and
at
evening
they
may
be
seen
trooping
in
to
the
camp
each
with
a
great
bundle
of
dandelions
or
trefoil
on
her
head
or
carrying
wooden
vessels
filled
with
seeds
which
they
afterwards
grind
up
between
stones
and
knead
into
a
paste
with
water
or
bake
into
cakes
among
the
aborigines
of
central
victoria
while
the
men
hunted
the
women
dug
up
edible
roots
and
gathered
succulent
vegetables
such
as
the
young
tops
of
the
the
and
several
kinds
of
the
implement
which
they
used
to
dig
up
roots
with
was
a
pole
seven
or
eight
feet
long
hardened
in
the
fire
and
pointed
at
the
end
which
also
served
them
as
a
weapon
both
of
defence
and
of
offence
among
the
tribes
of
central
australia
the
principal
vegetable
food
is
the
seed
of
a
species
of
claytonia
called
by
white
men
which
the
women
gather
in
large
quantities
and
winnow
by
pouring
the
little
black
seeds
from
one
vessel
to
another
so
as
to
let
the
wind
blow
the
loose
husks
away
in
these
customs
observed
by
savages
who
are
totally
ignorant
of
agriculture
we
may
perhaps
detect
some
of
the
steps
by
which
mankind
have
advanced
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
wild
fruits
of
the
earth
to
the
systematic
cultivation
of
plants
for
an
effect
of
digging
up
the
earth
in
the
search
for
roots
has
probably
been
in
many
cases
to
enrich
and
fertilise
the
soil
and
so
to
increase
the
crop
of
roots
or
herbs
and
such
an
increase
would
naturally
attract
the
natives
in
larger
numbers
and
enable
them
to
subsist
for
longer
periods
on
the
spot
without
being
compelled
by
the
speedy
exhaustion
of
the
crop
to
shift
their
quarters
and
wander
away
in
search
of
fresh
supplies
moreover
the
winnowing
of
the
seeds
on
ground
which
had
thus
been
turned
up
by
the
of
the
women
would
naturally
contribute
to
the
same
result
for
though
savages
at
the
level
of
the
californian
indians
and
the
aborigines
of
australia
have
no
idea
of
using
seeds
for
any
purpose
but
that
of
immediate
consumption
and
it
has
never
occurred
to
them
to
incur
a
temporary
loss
for
the
sake
of
a
future
gain
by
sowing
them
in
the
ground
yet
it
is
almost
certain
that
in
the
process
of
winnowing
the
seeds
as
a
preparation
for
eating
them
many
of
the
grains
must
have
escaped
and
being
wafted
by
the
wind
have
fallen
on
the
upturned
soil
and
borne
fruit
thus
by
the
operations
of
turning
up
the
ground
and
winnowing
the
seed
though
neither
operation
aimed
at
anything
beyond
satisfying
the
immediate
pangs
of
hunger
savage
man
or
rather
savage
woman
was
unconsciously
preparing
for
the
whole
community
a
future
and
more
abundant
store
of
food
which
would
enable
them
to
multiply
and
to
abandon
the
old
migratory
and
wasteful
manner
of
life
for
a
more
settled
and
economic
mode
of
existence
so
curiously
sometimes
does
man
aiming
his
shafts
at
a
near
but
petty
mark
hit
a
greater
and
more
distant
target
on
the
whole
then
it
appears
highly
probable
that
as
a
consequence
of
a
certain
natural
division
of
labour
between
the
sexes
women
have
contributed
more
than
men
towards
the
greatest
advance
in
economic
history
namely
the
transition
from
a
nomadic
to
a
settled
life
from
a
natural
to
an
artificial
basis
of
subsistence
among
the
aryan
peoples
of
europe
the
old
practice
of
hoeing
the
ground
as
a
preparation
for
sowing
appears
to
have
been
generally
replaced
at
a
very
remote
period
by
the
far
more
effective
process
of
ploughing
and
as
the
labour
of
ploughing
practically
necessitates
the
employment
of
masculine
strength
it
is
hardly
to
be
expected
that
in
europe
many
traces
should
remain
of
the
important
part
formerly
played
by
women
in
primitive
agriculture
however
we
are
told
that
among
the
iberians
of
spain
and
the
athamanes
of
epirus
the
women
tilled
the
ground
and
that
among
the
ancient
germans
the
care
of
the
fields
was
left
to
the
women
and
old
men
but
these
indications
of
an
age
when
the
cultivation
of
the
ground
was
committed
mainly
to
feminine
hands
are
few
and
slight
and
if
the
greek
conception
of
demeter
as
a
goddess
of
corn
and
agriculture
really
dates
from
such
an
age
and
was
directly
suggested
by
such
a
division
of
labour
between
the
sexes
it
seems
clear
that
its
origin
must
be
sought
at
a
period
far
back
in
the
history
of
the
aryan
race
perhaps
long
before
the
segregation
of
the
greeks
from
the
common
stock
and
their
formation
into
a
separate
people
it
may
be
so
but
to
me
i
confess
that
this
derivation
of
the
conception
appears
somewhat
and
improbable
and
i
prefer
to
suppose
that
the
idea
of
the
corn
as
feminine
was
suggested
to
the
greek
mind
not
by
the
position
of
women
in
remote
prehistoric
ages
but
by
a
direct
observation
of
nature
the
teeming
head
of
corn
appearing
to
the
primitive
fancy
to
resemble
the
teeming
womb
of
a
woman
and
the
ripe
ear
on
the
stalk
being
likened
to
a
child
borne
in
the
arms
or
on
the
back
of
its
mother
at
least
we
know
that
similar
sights
suggest
similar
ideas
to
some
of
the
agricultural
negroes
of
west
africa
thus
the
hos
of
togoland
who
plant
maize
in
february
and
reap
it
in
july
say
that
the
maize
is
an
image
of
a
mother
when
the
cobs
are
forming
the
mother
is
binding
the
infant
on
her
back
but
in
july
she
sinks
her
head
and
dies
and
the
child
is
taken
away
from
her
to
be
afterwards
multiplied
at
the
next
sowing
when
the
rude
aborigines
of
western
australia
observe
that
a
plant
has
flowered
they
call
it
the
mother
of
naming
the
particular
kind
of
plant
and
they
will
not
allow
it
to
be
dug
up
apparently
they
think
that
respect
and
regard
are
due
to
the
plant
as
to
a
mother
and
her
child
such
simple
and
natural
comparisons
which
may
occur
to
men
in
any
age
and
country
suffice
to
explain
the
greek
personification
of
the
corn
as
mother
and
daughter
and
we
need
not
cast
about
for
more
recondite
theories
be
that
as
it
may
the
conception
of
the
corn
as
a
woman
and
a
mother
was
certainly
not
peculiar
to
the
ancient
greeks
but
has
been
shared
by
them
with
many
other
races
as
will
appear
abundantly
from
the
instances
which
i
shall
cite
in
the
following
chapter
chapter
the
and
the
in
northern
europe
it
has
been
argued
by
mannhardt
that
the
first
part
of
demeter
s
name
is
derived
from
an
alleged
cretan
word
barley
and
that
accordingly
demeter
means
neither
more
nor
less
than
or
for
the
root
of
the
word
seems
to
have
been
applied
to
different
kinds
of
grain
by
different
branches
of
the
aryans
as
crete
appears
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
ancient
seats
of
the
worship
of
demeter
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
her
name
were
of
cretan
origin
but
the
etymology
is
open
to
serious
objections
and
it
is
safer
therefore
to
lay
no
stress
on
it
be
that
as
it
may
we
have
found
independent
reasons
for
identifying
demeter
as
the
and
of
the
two
species
of
corn
associated
with
her
in
greek
religion
namely
barley
and
wheat
the
barley
has
perhaps
the
better
claim
to
be
her
original
element
for
not
only
would
it
seem
to
have
been
the
staple
food
of
the
greeks
in
the
homeric
age
but
there
are
grounds
for
believing
that
it
is
one
of
the
oldest
if
not
the
very
oldest
cereal
cultivated
by
the
aryan
race
certainly
the
use
of
barley
in
the
religious
ritual
of
the
ancient
hindoos
as
well
as
of
the
ancient
greeks
furnishes
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
the
great
antiquity
of
its
cultivation
which
is
known
to
have
been
practised
by
the
of
the
stone
age
in
europe
analogies
to
the
or
of
ancient
greece
have
been
collected
in
great
abundance
by
mannhardt
from
the
of
modern
europe
the
following
may
serve
as
specimens
in
germany
the
corn
is
very
commonly
personified
under
the
name
of
the
thus
in
spring
when
the
corn
waves
in
the
wind
the
peasants
say
there
comes
the
or
the
is
running
over
the
field
or
the
is
going
through
the
when
children
wish
to
go
into
the
fields
to
pull
the
blue
or
the
red
poppies
they
are
told
not
to
do
so
because
the
is
sitting
in
the
corn
and
will
catch
them
or
again
she
is
called
according
to
the
crop
the
or
the
and
children
are
warned
against
straying
in
the
rye
or
among
the
peas
by
threats
of
the
or
the
in
norway
also
the
is
said
to
sit
among
the
peas
similar
expressions
are
current
among
the
slavs
the
poles
and
czechs
warn
children
against
the
who
sits
in
the
corn
or
they
call
her
the
old
and
say
that
she
sits
in
the
corn
and
strangles
the
children
who
tread
it
down
the
lithuanians
say
the
old
sits
in
the
again
the
is
believed
to
make
the
crop
grow
thus
in
the
neighbourhood
of
magdeburg
it
is
sometimes
said
it
will
be
a
good
year
for
flax
the
has
been
at
dinkelsbühl
in
bavaria
down
to
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
people
believed
that
when
the
crops
on
a
particular
farm
compared
unfavourably
with
those
of
the
neighbourhood
the
reason
was
that
the
had
punished
the
farmer
for
his
sins
in
a
village
of
styria
it
is
said
that
the
in
the
shape
of
a
female
puppet
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
of
corn
and
dressed
in
white
may
be
seen
at
midnight
in
the
which
she
fertilises
by
passing
through
them
but
if
she
is
angry
with
a
farmer
she
withers
up
all
his
corn
further
the
plays
an
important
part
in
harvest
customs
she
is
believed
to
be
present
in
the
handful
of
corn
which
is
left
standing
last
on
the
field
and
with
the
cutting
of
this
last
handful
she
is

one

that
the

again
the
fertilising
power
of

indicated
in

also
in

the

of
the

of
the

mother
of
the

mother
of

or
mother
of
the
oats
they
leave
it
standing
in
the
field
till
the
last
waggon
is
about
to
wend
homewards
then
they
make
a
puppet
out
of
it
dress
it
with
clothes
belonging
to
the
farmer
and
adorn
it
with
a
crown
and
a

a

of
a

is
stuck
in

of
the

at

in

evening
the
ceres
is
set
in

and
the
reaper
who
reaped
fastest
dances
round
it
with
the
prettiest
girl
for
his
partner
after
the
dance
a
pyre
is
made
all
the
girls
each
wearing
a

strip
the
puppet
pull
it
to
pieces
and
place
it
on
the
pyre
along
with
the
flowers
with
which
it
was
adorned
then
the
girl
who
was
the
first
to
finish
reaping
sets
fire
to
the
pile
and
all
pray
that
ceres
may
give
a
fruitful
year
here
as
mannhardt
observes
the
old
custom
has
remained
intact
though
the
name
ceres
is
a
bit
of
schoolmaster
s
learning
in
upper
brittany
the
last
sheaf
is
always
made
into
human
shape
but
if
the
farmer
is
a
married
man
it
is
made
double
and
consists
of
a
little
placed
inside
of
a
large

this
is
called
the

is
delivered
to
the

who
unties

then
the
reapers
dance
about
with
it
in
some
parts
of
westphalia
the
last
sheaf
at
the
is
made
especially
heavy
by
fastening
stones
in
it
they
bring
it
home
on
the
last
waggon
and
call
it
the
great
mother
though
they
do
not
fashion
it
into
any
special
shape
in
the
district
of
erfurt
a
very
heavy
sheaf
not
necessarily
the

is
called
the
great

and
is
carried
on
the
last
waggon
to
the
barn
where
all
hands
lift
it
down
amid
a
fire
of
jokes
sometimes
again
the

is
called
the

and
is
adorned
with
flowers
ribbons
and
a

in

prussia
at

the
men

servants
strive
who

called
the

whoever
gets
it
will
be
married
in

but
his
or

spouse
will
be

sometimes
goes
by

of
the

not

way
but
all
the
reapers
throw
their
sickles
at
it
and
try
to
bring
it
down
it
is
plaited
and
kept
till
the
next
autumn
whoever
gets
it
will
marry
in
the

oftener
the
last

is
called
the

the
old
man
in
germany
it
is
frequently
shaped
and
dressed
as
a

and
the

altisheim
in
swabia
when
all
the

all
the

stand
in
a
row
before
the

each
cuts
his
share
rapidly
and
he
who
gives
the
last
cut
has
the
old
when
the
sheaves
are
being
set
up
in
heaps
the
person
who
gets
hold
of
the
old
woman
which
is
the
largest
and
thickest
of
all
the
sheaves
is
jeered
at
by
the
rest
who
call
out
to
him
he
has
the
old
woman
and
must
keep
the
woman
who
binds
the

the

is
made
up
into
a
human

and
called

the

the

dress
up
the

in
the

of
a

this
figure
goes
by
the
laggard

name
as
the

the
idle

is
brought
home
on

and
as

the

the

it
to
him
while
he
recites
some
verses
of
the

it
is
said
that
he
has
the
old
probably
the
puppet
is
or
used
to
be
made
out
of
the
last
corn
cut
in
many
districts
of
saxony
the
last
sheaf
used
to
be
adorned
with
ribbons
and
set
upright
so
as
to
look
like
a
man
it
was
then
known
as
the
old
man
and
the
young
women
brought
it
back
in
procession
to
the
farm
singing
as
they
went
now
we
are
bringing
the
old
in
west
prussia
when
the
last
rye
is
being
raked
together
the
women
and
girls
hurry
with
the
work
for
none
of
them
likes
to
be
the
last
and
to
get
the
old
man
that
is
a
puppet
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
which
must
be
carried
before
the
other
reapers
by
the
person
who
was
the
last
to
finish
in
silesia
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
old
woman
or
the
old
man
and
is
the
theme
of
many
jests
it
is
made
unusually
large
and
is
sometimes
weighted
with
a
stone
at
girlachsdorf
near
reichenbach
when
this
heavy
sheaf
is
lifted
into
the
waggon
they
say
that
is
the
old
man
whom
we
sought
for
so
among
the
germans
of
west
bohemia
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
corn
is
said
to
have
the
old
in
former
times
it
used
to
be
customary
to
put
a
wreath
on
his
head
and
to
play
all
kinds
of
pranks
with
him
and
at
the
harvest
supper
he
was
given
the
largest
portion
at
wolletz
in
westphalia
the
last
sheaf
at
harvest
is
called
the
old
man
and
being
made
up
into
the
likeness
of
a
man
and
decorated
with
flowers
it
is
presented
to
the
farmer
who
in
return
prepares
a
feast
for
the
reapers
about
unna
in
westphalia
the
last
sheaf
at
harvest
is
made
unusually
large
and
stones
are
inserted
to
increase
its
weight
it
is
called
greaute
the
grey
mother
and
when
it
is
brought
home
on
the
waggon
water
is
thrown
on
the
harvesters
who
accompany
it
among
the
wends
the
man
or
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
at
wheat
harvest
is
said
to
have
the
old
a
puppet
is
made
out
of
the
wheaten
straw
and
ears
in
the
likeness
of
a
man
and
decked
with
flowers
the
person
who
bound
the
last
sheaf
must
carry
the
old
man
home
while
the
rest
laugh
and
jeer
at
him
the
puppet
is
hung
up
in
the
farmhouse
and
remains
till
a
new
old
man
is
made
at
the
next
harvest
at
the
close
of
the
harvest
the
arabs
of
moab
bury
the
last
sheaf
in
a
grave
in
the
cornfield
saying
as
they
do
so
we
are
burying
the
old
man
or
the
old
man
is
in
some
of
these
customs
as
mannhardt
has
remarked
the
person
who
is
called
by
the
same
name
as
the
last
sheaf
and
sits
beside
it
on
the
last
waggon
is
obviously
identified
with
it
he
or
she
represents
the
which
has
been
caught
in
the
last
sheaf
in
other
words
the
is
represented
in
duplicate
by
a
human
being
and
by
a
sheaf
the
identification
of
the
person
with
the
sheaf
is
made
still
clearer
by
the
custom
of
wrapping
up
in
the
last
sheaf
the
person
who
cuts
or
binds
it
thus
at
hermsdorf
in
silesia
it
used
to
be
the
regular
practice
to
tie
up
in
the
last
sheaf
the
woman
who
had
bound
it
at
weiden
in
bavaria
it
is
the
cutter
not
the
binder
of
the
last
sheaf
who
is
tied
up
in
it
here
the
person
wrapt
up
in
the
corn
represents
the
exactly
as
a
person
wrapt
in
branches
or
leaves
represents
the
the
last
sheaf
designated
as
the
old
woman
is
often
distinguished
from
the
other
sheaves
by
its
size
and
weight
thus
in
some
villages
of
west
prussia
the
old
woman
is
made
twice
as
long
and
thick
as
a
common
sheaf
and
a
stone
is
fastened
in
the
middle
of
it
sometimes
it
is
made
so
heavy
that
a
man
can
barely
lift
it
at
in
samland
eight
or
nine
sheaves
are
often
tied
together
to
make
the
old
woman
and
the
man
who
sets
it
up
grumbles
at
its
weight
at
itzgrund
in
the
last
sheaf
called
the
old
woman
is
made
large
with
the
express
intention
of
thereby
securing
a
good
crop
next
year
thus
the
custom
of
making
the
last
sheaf
unusually
large
or
heavy
is
a
charm
working
by
sympathetic
magic
to
ensure
a
large
and
heavy
crop
at
the
following
harvest
in
denmark
also
the
last
sheaf
is
made
larger
than
the
others
and
is
called
the
old
or
the
old
no
one
likes
to
bind
it
because
whoever
does
so
will
be
sure
they
think
to
marry
an
old
man
or
an
old
woman
sometimes
the
last
called
the
old
is
made
up
in
human
shape
with
head
arms
and
legs
and
being
dressed
in
clothes
is
carried
home
on
the
last
waggon
while
the
harvesters
sit
beside
it
drinking
and
huzzaing
of
the
person
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
it
is
said
she
or
he
is
the
old
in
scotland
when
the
last
corn
was
cut
after
hallowmas
the
female
figure
made
out
of
it
was
sometimes
called
the
carlin
or
carline
that
is
the
old
woman
but
if
cut
before
hallowmas
it
was
called
the
maiden
if
cut
after
sunset
it
was
called
the
witch
being
supposed
to
bring
bad
luck
among
the
highlanders
of
scotland
the
last
corn
cut
at
harvest
is
known
either
as
the
old
wife
or
as
the
maiden
on
the
whole
the
former
name
seems
to
prevail
in
the
western
and
the
latter
in
the
central
and
eastern
districts
of
the
maiden
we
shall
speak
presently
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
old
wife
the
following
general
account
of
the
custom
is
given
by
a
careful
and
enquirer
the
rev
campbell
minister
of
the
remote
hebridean
island
of
tiree
the
harvest
old
wife
harvest
there
was
a
struggle
to
escape
from
being
the
last
done
with
the
shearing
and
when
tillage
in
common
existed
instances
were
known
of
a
ridge
being
left
unshorn
no
person
would
claim
it
because
of
it
being
behind
the
rest
the
fear
entertained
was
that
of
having
the
famine
of
the
farm
a
in
the
shape
of
an
imaginary
old
woman
to
feed
till
next
harvest
much
emulation
and
amusement
arose
from
the
fear
of
this
old
woman
the
first
done
made
a
doll
of
some
blades
of
corn
which
was
called
the
old
wife
and
sent
it
to
his
nearest
neighbour
he
in
turn
when
ready
passed
it
to
another
still
less
expeditious
and
the
person
it
last
remained
with
had
the
old
woman
to
keep
for
that
to
illustrate
the
custom
by
examples
in
bernera
on
the
west
of
lewis
the
harvest
rejoicing
goes
by
the
name
of
the
old
wife
from
the
last
sheaf
cut
whether
in
a
township
farm
or
croft
where
there
are
a
number
of
crofts
beside
each
other
there
is
always
great
rivalry
as
to
who
shall
first
finish
reaping
and
so
have
the
old
wife
before
his
neighbours
some
people
even
go
out
on
a
clear
night
to
reap
their
fields
after
their
neighbours
have
retired
to
rest
in
order
that
they
may
have
the
old
wife
first
more
neighbourly
habits
however
usually
prevail
and
as
each
finishes
his
own
fields
he
goes
to
the
help
of
another
till
the
whole
crop
is
cut
the
reaping
is
still
done
with
the
sickle
when
the
corn
has
been
cut
on
all
the
crofts
the
last
sheaf
is
dressed
up
to
look
as
like
an
old
woman
as
possible
she
wears
a
white
cap
a
dress
an
apron
and
a
little
shawl
over
the
shoulders
fastened
with
a
sprig
of
heather
the
apron
is
tucked
up
to
form
a
pocket
which
is
stuffed
with
bread
and
cheese
a
sickle
stuck
in
the
string
of
the
apron
at
the
back
completes
her
equipment
this
costume
and
outfit
mean
that
the
old
wife
is
ready
to
bear
a
hand
in
the
work
of
harvesting
at
the
feast
which
follows
the
old
wife
is
placed
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
as
the
whisky
goes
round
each
of
the
company
drinks
to
her
saying
here
s
to
the
one
that
has
helped
us
with
the
when
the
table
has
been
cleared
away
and
dancing
begins
one
of
the
lads
leads
out
the
old
wife
and
dances
with
her
and
if
the
night
is
fine
the
party
will
sometimes
go
out
and
march
in
a
body
to
a
considerable
distance
singing
while
one
of
them
carries
the
old
wife
on
his
back
when
the
is
over
the
old
wife
is
shorn
of
her
gear
and
used
for
ordinary
purposes
in
the
island
of
islay
the
last
corn
cut
also
goes
by
the
name
of
the
old
wife
and
when
she
has
done
her
duty
at
harvest
she
is
hung
up
on
the
wall
and
stays
there
till
the
time
comes
to
plough
the
fields
for
the
next
year
s
crop
then
she
is
taken
down
and
on
the
first
day
when
the
men
go
to
plough
she
is
divided
among
them
by
the
mistress
of
the
house
they
take
her
in
their
pockets
and
give
her
to
the
horses
to
eat
when
they
reach
the
field
this
is
supposed
to
secure
good
luck
for
the
next
harvest
and
is
understood
to
be
the
proper
end
of
the
old
wife
in
kintyre
also
the
name
of
the
old
wife
is
given
to
the
last
corn
cut
on
the
shores
of
the
beautiful
loch
awe
a
long
sheet
of
water
winding
among
soft
green
hills
above
which
the
giant
ben
cruachan
towers
bold
and
rugged
on
the
north
the
harvest
custom
is
somewhat
different
the
name
of
the
old
wife
is
here
bestowed
not
on
the
last
corn
cut
but
on
the
reaper
who
is
the
last
to
finish
he
bears
it
as
a
term
of
reproach
and
is
not
privileged
to
reap
the
last
ears
left
standing
on
the
contrary
these
are
cut
by
the
reaper
who
was
the
first
to
finish
his
or
strip
literally
claw
and
out
of
them
is
fashioned
the
maiden
which
is
afterwards
hung
up
according
to
one
statement
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
death
of
horses
in
in
the
of
scotland
the
one
who
took
the
last
of
the
grain
from
the
field
to
the
stackyard
was
called
the
each
one
did
what
could
be
done
to
avoid
being
the
last
on
the
field
and
when
there
were
several
on
the
field
there
was
a
race
to
get
off
the
unfortunate
winter
was
the
subject
of
a
good
deal
of
teasing
and
was
dressed
up
in
all
the
old
clothes
that
could
be
gathered
about
the
farm
and
placed
on
the
bink
to
eat
his
so
in
caithness
the
person
who
cuts
the
last
sheaf
is
called
winter
and
retains
the
name
till
the
next
harvest
usages
of
the
same
sort
are
reported
from
wales
thus
in
north
pembrokeshire
a
tuft
of
the
last
corn
cut
from
six
to
twelve
inches
long
is
plaited
and
goes
by
the
name
of
the
hag
and
quaint
old
customs
used
to
be
practised
with
it
within
the
memory
of
many
persons
still
alive
great
was
the
excitement
among
the
reapers
when
the
last
patch
of
standing
corn
was
reached
all
in
turn
threw
their
sickles
at
it
and
the
one
who
succeeded
in
cutting
it
received
a
jug
of
ale
the
hag
was
then
hurriedly
made
and
taken
to
a
neighbouring
farm
where
the
reapers
were
still
busy
at
their
work
this
was
generally
done
by
the
ploughman
but
he
had
to
be
very
careful
not
to
be
observed
by
his
neighbours
for
if
they
saw
him
coming
and
had
the
least
suspicion
of
his
errand
they
would
soon
make
him
retrace
his
steps
creeping
stealthily
up
behind
a
fence
he
waited
till
the
foreman
of
his
neighbour
s
reapers
was
just
opposite
him
and
within
easy
reach
then
he
suddenly
threw
the
hag
over
the
fence
and
if
possible
upon
the
foreman
s
sickle
crying
out
y
codais
i
y
dilynais
i
ei
gwar
on
that
he
took
to
his
heels
and
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
run
and
he
was
a
lucky
man
if
he
escaped
without
being
caught
or
cut
by
the
flying
sickles
which
the
infuriated
reapers
hurled
after
him
in
other
cases
the
hag
was
brought
home
to
the
farmhouse
by
one
of
the
reapers
he
did
his
best
to
bring
it
home
dry
and
without
being
observed
but
he
was
apt
to
be
roughly
handled
by
the
people
of
the
house
if
they
suspected
his
errand
sometimes
they
stripped
him
of
most
of
his
clothes
sometimes
they
would
drench
him
with
water
which
had
been
carefully
stored
in
buckets
and
pans
for
the
purpose
if
however
he
succeeded
in
bringing
the
hag
in
dry
and
unobserved
the
master
of
the
house
had
to
pay
him
a
small
fine
or
sometimes
a
jug
of
beer
from
the
cask
next
to
the
wall
which
seems
to
have
commonly
held
the
best
beer
would
be
demanded
by
the
bearer
the
hag
was
then
carefully
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
hall
or
elsewhere
and
kept
there
all
the
year
the
custom
of
bringing
in
the
hag
into
the
house
and
hanging
it
up
still
exists
in
some
farms
of
north
pembrokeshire
but
the
ancient
ceremonies
which
have
just
been
described
are
now
discontinued
similar
customs
at
harvest
were
observed
in
south
pembrokeshire
within
living
memory
in
that
part
of
the
country
there
used
to
be
a
competition
between
neighbouring
farms
to
see
which
would
finish
reaping
first
the
foreman
of
the
reapers
planned
so
as
to
finish
the
reaping
in
a
corner
of
the
field
out
of
sight
of
the
people
on
the
next
farm
there
with
the
last
handful
of
corn
cut
he
would
make
two
old
women
or
hags
one
of
them
he
would
send
by
a
lad
or
other
messenger
to
be
laid
secretly
in
the
field
where
the
neighbours
were
still
at
work
cutting
their
corn
the
messenger
would
disguise
himself
to
look
like
a
stranger
and
jumping
the
fence
and
creeping
through
the
corn
he
would
lay
the
hag
in
a
place
where
the
reapers
in
reaping
would
be
sure
to
find
it
having
done
so
he
fled
for
dear
life
for
were
the
reapers
to
catch
him
they
would
shut
him
up
in
a
dark
room
and
not
let
him
out
till
he
had
cleaned
all
the
muddy
boots
shoes
and
clogs
in
the
house
the
second
hag
was
sent
or
taken
by
the
foreman
of
the
reapers
to
his
master
s
farmhouse
generally
he
tried
to
pop
into
the
house
unseen
and
lay
the
hag
on
the
kitchen
table
but
if
the
people
of
the
farm
caught
him
before
he
laid
it
down
they
used
to
drench
him
with
water
if
a
foreman
succeeded
in
getting
both
the
hags
laid
safe
in
their
proper
quarters
one
at
home
the
other
on
a
neighbour
s
farm
without
interruption
it
was
deemed
a
great
honour
in
county
antrim
down
to
some
years
ago
when
the
sickle
was
finally
expelled
by
the
reaping
machine
the
few
stalks
of
corn
left
standing
last
on
the
field
were
plaited
together
then
the
reapers
blindfolded
threw
their
sickles
at
the
plaited
corn
and
whoever
happened
to
cut
it
through
took
it
home
with
him
and
put
it
over
his
door
this
bunch
of
corn
was
called
the
carley
the
same
word
as
carlin
similar
customs
are
observed
by
slavonic
peoples
thus
in
poland
the
last
sheaf
is
commonly
called
the
baba
that
is
the
old
woman
in
the
last
sheaf
it
is
said
sits
the
the
sheaf
itself
is
also
called
the
baba
and
is
sometimes
composed
of
twelve
smaller
sheaves
lashed
together
in
some
parts
of
bohemia
the
baba
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
has
the
figure
of
a
woman
with
a
great
straw
hat
it
is
carried
home
on
the
last
and
delivered
along
with
a
garland
to
the
farmer
by
two
girls
in
binding
the
sheaves
the
women
strive
not
to
be
last
for
she
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
will
have
a
child
next
year
the
last
sheaf
is
tied
up
with
others
into
a
large
bundle
and
a
green
branch
is
stuck
on
the
top
of
it
sometimes
the
harvesters
call
out
to
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
she
has
the
baba
or
she
is
the
she
has
then
to
make
a
puppet
sometimes
in
female
sometimes
in
male
form
out
of
the
corn
the
puppet
is
occasionally
dressed
with
clothes
often
with
flowers
and
ribbons
only
the
cutter
of
the
last
stalks
as
well
as
the
binder
of
the
last
sheaf
was
also
called
baba
and
a
doll
called
the
was
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
and
adorned
with
ribbons
the
oldest
reaper
had
to
dance
first
with
this
doll
and
then
with
the
farmer
s
wife
in
the
district
of
cracow
when
a
man
binds
the
last
sheaf
they
say
the
grandfather
is
sitting
in
it
when
a
woman
binds
it
they
say
the
baba
is
sitting
in
it
and
the
woman
herself
is
wrapt
up
in
the
sheaf
so
that
only
her
head
projects
out
of
it
thus
encased
in
the
sheaf
she
is
carried
on
the
last
to
the
house
where
she
is
drenched
with
water
by
the
whole
family
she
remains
in
the
sheaf
till
the
dance
is
over
and
for
a
year
she
retains
the
name
of
baba
in
lithuania
the
name
for
the
last
sheaf
is
boba
old
woman
answering
to
the
polish
name
baba
the
boba
is
said
to
sit
in
the
corn
which
is
left
standing
last
the
person
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
or
digs
the
last
potato
is
the
subject
of
much
banter
and
receives
and
long
retains
the
name
of
the
old
or
the
old
the
last
made
into
the
form
of
a
woman
carried
solemnly
through
the
village
on
the
last
and
drenched
with
water
at
the
farmer
s
house
then
every
one
dances
with
it
in
russia
also
the
last
sheaf
is
often
shaped
and
dressed
as
a
woman
and
carried
with
dance
and
song
to
the
farmhouse
out
of
the
last
sheaf
the
bulgarians
make
a
doll
which
they
call
the
or
it
is
dressed
in
a
woman
s
shirt
carried
round
the
village
and
then
thrown
into
the
river
in
order
to
secure
plenty
of
rain
and
dew
for
the
next
year
s
crop
or
it
is
burned
and
the
ashes
strewn
on
the
fields
doubtless
to
fertilise
them
the
name
queen
as
applied
to
the
last
sheaf
has
its
analogies
in
central
and
northern
europe
thus
in
the
salzburg
district
of
austria
at
the
end
of
the
harvest
a
great
procession
takes
place
in
which
a
queen
of
the
is
drawn
along
in
a
little
carriage
by
young
fellows
the
custom
of
the
harvest
queen
appears
to
have
been
common
in
england
brand
quotes
from
hutchinson
s
of
the
following
i
have
seen
in
some
places
an
image
apparelled
in
great
finery
crowned
with
flowers
a
sheaf
of
corn
placed
under
her
arm
and
a
scycle
in
her
hand
carried
out
of
the
village
in
the
morning
of
the
conclusive
reaping
day
with
music
and
much
clamour
of
the
reapers
into
the
field
where
it
stands
fixed
on
a
pole
all
day
and
when
the
reaping
is
done
is
brought
home
in
like
manner
this
they
call
the
harvest
queen
and
it
represents
the
roman
again
the
traveller
clarke
tells
us
that
even
in
the
town
of
cambridge
and
centre
of
our
university
such
curious
remains
of
antient
customs
may
be
noticed
in
different
seasons
of
the
year
which
pass
without
observation
the
custom
of
blowing
horns
upon
the
first
of
may
old
style
is
derived
from
a
festival
in
honour
of
diana
at
the
as
it
is
called
or
harvest
home
i
have
seen
a
clown
dressed
in
woman
s
clothes
having
his
face
painted
his
head
decorated
with
ears
of
corn
and
bearing
about
him
other
symbols
of
ceres
carried
in
a
waggon
with
great
pomp
and
loud
shouts
through
the
streets
the
horses
being
covered
with
white
sheets
and
when
i
inquired
the
meaning
of
the
ceremony
was
answered
by
the
people
that
they
were
drawing
the
morgay
μητηρ
γη
or
harvest
milton
must
have
been
familiar
with
the
custom
of
the
harvest
queen
for
in
he
says
the
desirous
her
return
had
choicest
flow
rs
a
garland
to
tresses
and
her
rural
labours
crown
reapers
oft
are
wont
their
often
customs
of
this
sort
are
practised
not
on
the
but
on
the
the
spirit
of
the
corn
fleeing
before
the
reapers
as
they
cut
down
the
ripe
grain
quits
the
reaped
corn
and
takes
refuge
in
the
barn
where
it
appears
in
the
last
sheaf
threshed
either
to
perish
under
the
blows
of
the
flail
or
to
flee
thence
to
the
still
unthreshed
corn
of
a
neighbouring
farm
thus
the
last
corn
to
be
threshed
is
called
the
or
the
old
woman
sometimes
the
person
who
gives
the
last
stroke
with
the
flail
is
called
the
old
woman
and
is
wrapt
in
the
straw
of
the
last
sheaf
or
has
a
bundle
of
straw
fastened
on
his
back
whether
wrapt
in
the
straw
or
carrying
it
on
his
back
he
is
carted
through
the
village
amid
general
laughter
in
some
districts
of
bavaria
thüringen
and
elsewhere
the
man
who
threshes
the
last
sheaf
is
said
to
have
the
old
woman
or
the
old
he
is
tied
up
in
straw
carried
or
carted
about
the
village
and
set
down
at
last
on
the
dunghill
or
taken
to
the
of
a
neighbouring
farmer
who
has
not
finished
his
threshing
in
poland
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
called
baba
old
woman
he
is
wrapt
in
corn
and
wheeled
through
the
village
sometimes
in
lithuania
the
last
sheaf
is
not
threshed
but
is
fashioned
into
female
shape
and
carried
to
the
barn
of
a
neighbour
who
has
not
finished
his
threshing
at
chorinchen
near

the

is
said
to
get

so
forth
according
to

has
been
reaped
sometimes
he
is
called

he
is
dressed

he

the

separately
and
the

ground
into

baked
into

to
possess
healing

the

gets
the

a
hideous
scarecrow
tied
on
his

if

is
still
proceeding
at
another
farm
he
may
go
thither
and
rid
himself
of
his
burden
but
must
take
care
not
to
be
caught
in
this
way
a
farmer
who
is
with
his
threshing
may
receive
several
such
scarecrows
and
so
become
the
target
for
many
gibes
among

the

the

baked
in

is

the

say
of
the

gives
the

at

that

stareho
and
he
is
obliged
to
carry
a

puppet
to
a
neighbour
who
has
not

finished
his
threshing
where
he
throws
the
puppet
unobserved
over
the
fence
in
some
parts
of
sweden
when
a
stranger
woman
appears
on

put
round
her
body
stalks
of
corn
are
wound
round
her
neck
a
crown
of
ears
is
placed
on
her
head
and
the

call
out
behold
the

the
stranger
woman
thus
suddenly
appearing
is
taken
to
be
the
who
has
just
been
expelled
by
the
flails
from
the
in
other
cases
the
farmer
s
wife
represents
the
thus
in
the
commune
of
saligné
canton
de
poiret
vendée
the
farmer
s
wife
along
with
the
last
sheaf
is
tied
up
in
a
sheet
placed
on
a
litter
and
carried
to
the
threshing
machine
under
which
she
is
shoved
then
the
woman
is
drawn
out
and
the
sheaf
is
threshed
by
itself
but
the
woman
is
tossed
in
the
sheet
as
if
she
were
being
winnowed
it
would
be
impossible
to
express
more
clearly
the
identification
of
the
woman
with
the
corn
than
by
this
graphic
imitation
of
threshing
and
winnowing
her
mitigated
forms
of
the
custom
are
observed
in
various
places
thus
among
the
germans
of
schüttarschen
in
west
bohemia
it
was
customary
at
the
close
of
the
threshing
to
throttle
the
farmer
s
wife
by
squeezing
her
neck
between
the
arms
of
a
flail
till
she
consented
to
bake
a
special
kind
of
cake
called
a
from
to
thresh
a
similar
custom
of
throttling
the
farmer
s
wife
at
the
threshing
is
practised
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
only
there
the
pressure
is
applied
by
means
of
a
straw
rope
instead
of
a
flail
in
these
customs
the
spirit
of
the
ripe
corn
is
regarded
as
old
or
at
least
as
of
mature
age
hence
the
names
of
mother
grandmother
old
woman
and
so
forth
but
in
other
cases
the
is
conceived
as
young
thus
at
saldern
near
wolfenbuttel
when
the
rye
has
been
reaped
three
sheaves
are
tied
together
with
a
rope
so
as
to
make
a
puppet
with
the
corn
ears
for
a
head
this
puppet
is
called
the
maiden
or
the
sometimes
the
is
conceived
as
a
child
who
is
separated
from
its
mother
by
the
stroke
of
the
sickle
this
last
view
appears
in
the
polish
custom
of
calling
out
to
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
handful
of
corn
you
have
cut
the
in
some
districts
of
west
prussia
the
figure
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
bastard
and
a
boy
is
wrapt
up
in
it
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
and
represents
the
is
told
that
she
is
about
to
be
brought
to
bed
she
cries
like
a
woman
in
travail
and
an
old
woman
in
the
character
of
grandmother
acts
as
midwife
at
last
a
cry
is
raised
that
the
child
is
born
whereupon
the
boy
who
is
tied
up
in
the
sheaf
whimpers
and
squalls
like
an
infant
the
grandmother
wraps
a
sack
in
imitation
of
swaddling
bands
round
the
pretended
baby
who
is
carried
joyfully
to
the
barn
lest
he
should
catch
cold
in
the
open
air
in
other
parts
of
north
germany
the
last
sheaf
or
the
puppet
made
out
of
it
is
called
the
child
the
and
so
on
and
they
call
out
to
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
you
are
getting
the
in
the
north
of
england
particularly
in
the
counties
of
northumberland
durham
and
yorkshire
the
last
corn
cut
on
the
field
at
harvest
is
or
used
to
be
variously
known
as
the
or
the
of
which
and
are
merely
local
or
dialectical
variations
the
corn
so
cut
is
either
plaited
or
made
up
into
a
figure
which
goes
by
the
name
of
the
or
the
or
the
and
is
brought
home
with
rejoicings
at
the
end
of
the
harvest
in
the
north
riding
of
yorkshire
the
last
sheaf
gathered
in
is
called

the
expression
we
ve
gotten

as
much
as
to
say
the

formerly
a

made
out
of
a
sheaf
of
corn
decked
with
flowers
and
wrapped
in
such
of
the
reapers
garments
as
could
be
spared
it
was
carried
with
music
and
dancing
to
the
scene
of
the
which
was
called
the
in
the
north
of
yorkshire
the
was
frequently
made
of
such
dimensions
as
to
be
a
heavy
load
for
a
man
and
within
a
few
years
comparatively
was
proposed
as
the
prize
to
be
won
in
a
race
of
old
women
in
other
cases
it
was
carefully
preserved
and
set
up
in
some
conspicuous
place
in
the
where
the
last
sheaf
of
corn
cut
was
called
the
or
instead
of
the
the
customs
concerned
with
it
seem
to
have
been
essentially
similar
thus
we
are
told
that
in
the
north
it
was
common
for
the
reapers
on
the
last
day
of
the
reaping
to
have
a
contention
for
superiority
in
quickness
of
dispatch
groups
of
three
or
four
taking
each
a
ridge
and
striving
which
should
soonest
get
to
its
termination
in
scotland
this
was
called
a
which
simply
means
a
striving
in
the
north
of
england
it
was
a
as
the
reapers
went
on
during
the
last
day
they
took
care
to
leave
a
good
handful
of
the
grain
uncut
but
laid
down
flat
and
covered
over
and
when
the
field
was
done
the
bonniest
lass
was
allowed
to
cut
this
final
handful
which
was
presently
dressed
up
with
various
sewings
tyings
and
trimmings
like
a
doll
and
hailed
as
a
it
was
brought
home
in
triumph
with
music
of
fiddles
and
bagpipes
was
set
up
conspicuously
that
night
at
supper
and
was
usually
preserved
in
the
farmer
s
parlour
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
the
bonny
lass
who
cut
this
handful
of
grain
was
deemed
the
st
to
cut
the
last
portion
of
standing
corn
in
the
harvest
field
was
known
as
to
get
the
kirn
or
to
win
the
kirn
and
as
soon
as
this
was
done
the
reapers
let
the
neighbours
know
that
the
harvest
was
finished
by
giving
three
cheers
which
was
called
to
cry
or
shout
the
where
the
last
handful
of
standing
corn
was
called
the
the
stalks
were
roughly
plaited
together
and
the
reapers
threw
their
sickles
at
it
till
some
one
cut
it
through
which
was
called
cutting
the
the
severed
churn
that
is
the
plaited
corn
was
then
placed
over
the
kitchen
door
or
over
the
hob
in
the
chimney
for
good
luck
and
as
a
charm
against
witchcraft
in
kent
the
ivy
girl
is
or
used
to
be
a
figure
composed
of
some
of
the
best
corn
the
field
produces
and
made
as
well
as
they
can
into
a
human
shape
this
is
afterwards
curiously
dressed
by
the
women
and
adorned
with
paper
trimmings
cut
to
resemble
a
cap
ruffles
handkerchief
of
the
finest
lace
it
is
brought
home
with
the
last
load
of
corn
from
the
field
upon
the
waggon
and
they
suppose
entitles
them
to
a
supper
at
the
expense
of
the
in
some
parts
of
scotland
as
well
as
in
the
north
of
england
the
last
handful
of
corn
cut
on
the
was
called
the
and
the
person
who
carried
it
off
was
said
to
win
the
it
was
then
dressed
up
like
a
child
s
doll
and
went
by
the
name
of
the
the
or
the
maiden
in
berwickshire
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
there
was
an
eager
competition
among
the
reapers
to
cut
the
last
bunch
of
standing
corn
they
gathered
round
it
at
a
little
distance
and
threw
their
sickles
in
turn
at
it
and
the
man
who
succeeded
in
cutting
it
through
gave
it
to
the
girl
he
preferred
she
made
the
corn
so
cut
into
a
and
dressed
it
and
the
doll
was
then
taken
to
the
farmhouse
and
hung
up
there
till
the
next
harvest
when
its
place
was
taken
by
the
new
at
spottiswoode
westruther
parish
in
berwickshire
the
reaping
of
the
last
corn
at
harvest
was
called
cutting
the
queen
almost
as
often
as
cutting
the
the
mode
of
cutting
it
was
not
by
throwing
sickles
one
of
the
reapers
consented
to
be
blindfolded
and
having
been
given
a
sickle
in
his
hand
and
turned
twice
or
thrice
about
by
his
fellows
he
was
bidden
to
go
and
cut
the
kirn
his
groping
about
and
making
wild
strokes
in
the
air
with
his
sickle
excited
much
hilarity
when
he
had
tired
himself
out
in
vain
and
given
up
the
task
as
hopeless
another
reaper
was
blindfolded
and
pursued
the
quest
and
so
on
one
after
the
other
till
at
last
the
kirn
was
cut
the
successful
reaper
was
tossed
up
in
the
air
with
three
cheers
by
his
brother
harvesters
to
decorate
the
room
in
which
the
was
held
at
spottiswoode
as
well
as
the
granary
where
the
dancing
took
place
two
women
made
or
queens
every
year
and
many
of
these
rustic
effigies
of
the
might
be
seen
hanging
up
together
at
lanfine
in
ayrshire
down
to
near
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
last
bunch
of
standing
corn
at
harvest
was
occasionally
at
least
plaited
together
and
the
reapers
tried
to
cut
it
by
throwing
their
sickles
at
it
when
they
failed
in
the
attempt
a
woman
has
been
known
to
run
in
and
sever
the
stalks
at
a
blow
in
dumfriesshire
also
within
living
memory
it
used
to
be
customary
to
cut
the
last
standing
corn
by
throwing
the
sickles
at
it
in
the
north
of
ireland
the
harvest
customs
were
similar
but
there
as
in
some
parts
of
england
the
last
patch
of
standing
corn
bore
the
name
of
the
a
dialectical
variation
of
the
custom
of
winning
the
churn
was
prevalent
all
through
the
counties
of
down
and
antrim
fifty
years
ago
it
was
carried
out
at
the
end
of
the
harvest
or
reaping
the
grain
on
each
farm
or
holding
were
it
small
or
large
oats
are
the
main
crop
of
the
district
but
the
custom
was
the
same
for
other
kinds
of
grain
when
the
reapers
had
nearly
finished
the
last
field
a
handful
of
the
stalks
was
selected
carefully
plaited
as
it
stood
and
fastened
at
the
top
just
under
the
ears
to
keep
the
plait
in
place
then
when
all
the
corn
was
cut
from
about
this
which
was
known
as
and
the
sheaves
about
it
had
been
removed
to
some
distance
the
reapers
stood
in
a
group
about
ten
yards
off
it
and
each
whirled
his
sickle
at
the
till
one
lucky
one
succeeded
in
cutting
it
down
when
he
was
cheered
on
his
achievement
this
person
had
then
the
right
of
presenting
it
to
the
master
or
mistress
of
the
farm
who
gave
the
reaper
a
a
supper
and
a
dance
of
the
reapers
in
the
farmhouse
often
concluded
the
day
the
trimmed
and
adorned
with
ribbons
was
hung
up
on
a
wall
in
the
farmhouse
and
carefully
preserved
it
was
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
six
or
even
twelve
or
more
such
decorating
the
walls
of
a
farmhouse
in
county
down
or
antrim
in
some
parts
of
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
last
handful
of
corn
that
is
cut
by
the
reapers
on
any
particular
farm
is
called
the
maiden
or
in
gaelic
literally
the
shorn
superstitions
attach
to
the
winning
of
the
maiden
if
it
is
got
by
a
young
person
they
think
it
an
omen
that
he
or
she
will
be
married
before
another
harvest
for
that
or
other
reasons
there
is
a
strife
between
the
reapers
as
to
who
shall
get
the
maiden
and
they
resort
to
various
stratagems
for
the
purpose
of
securing
it
one
of
them
for
example
will
often
leave
a
handful
of
corn
uncut
and
cover
it
up
with
earth
to
hide
it
from
the
other
reapers
till
all
the
rest
of
the
corn
on
the
field
is
cut
down
several
may
try
to
play
the
same
trick
and
the
one
who
is
coolest
and
holds
out
longest
obtains
the
coveted
distinction
when
it
has
been
cut
the
maiden
is
dressed
with
ribbons
into
a
sort
of
doll
and
affixed
to
a
wall
of
the
farmhouse
in
the
north
of
scotland
the
maiden
is
carefully
preserved
till
yule
morning
when
it
is
divided
among
the
cattle
to
make
them
thrive
all
the
year
round
in
the
island
of
mull
and
some
parts
of
the
mainland
of
argyleshire
the
last
handful
of
corn
cut
is
called
the
maiden
near
ardrishaig
in
argyleshire
the
maiden
is
made
up
in
a
fanciful
shape
decorated
with
ribbons
and
hung
from
a
nail
on
the
wall
the
following
account
of
the
maiden
was
obtained
in
the
summer
of
from
the
manager
of
a
farm
near
kilmartin
in
argyleshire
the

the

the

of
both
sexes
when
they
neared
the

the
festival
the
sheaf
so
designated
was
carefully
preserved
and
kept
intact
until
the
day
they
began
leading
home
the
corn
a
tuft
of
it
was
then
given
to
each
of
the
horses
as
they
started
from
the
with
their
first
load
the
rest
of
it
was
neatly
made
up
and
hung
in
some
conspicuous
corner
of
the
farmhouse
where
it
remained
till
it
was
replaced
by
a
younger
sister
next
season
on
the
first
day
of
ploughing
a
tuft
of
it
was
given
as
on
the
first
day
of
leading
home
the
corn
as
a
or
handsel
for
luck
to
the
horses
the
so
preserved
and
used
was
a
symbol
that
the
harvest
had
been
duly
secured
and
that
the
spring
work
had
been
properly
inaugurated
it
was
also
believed
to
be
a
protection
against
fairies
and
in
the
parish
of
longforgan
situated
at
the
corner
of
perthshire
it
used
to
be
customary
to
give
what
was
called
the
maiden
feast
at
the
end
of
the
harvest
the
last
handful
of
corn
reaped
on
the
field
was
called
the
maiden
and
things
were
generally
so
arranged
that
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
pretty
girl
it
was
then
decked
out
with
ribbons
and
brought
home
in
triumph
to
the
music
of
bagpipes
and
fiddles
in
the
evening
the
reapers
danced
and
made
merry
afterwards
the
maiden
was
dressed
out
generally
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
hung
up
with
the
date
attached
to
it
in
a
conspicuous
part
of
the
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
balquhidder
perthshire
the
last
handful
of
corn
is
cut
by
the
youngest
girl
on
the
field
and
is
made
into
the
rude
form
of
a
female
doll
clad
in
a
paper
dress
and
decked
with
ribbons
it
is
called
the
maiden
and
is
kept
in
the
farmhouse
generally
above
the
chimney
for
a
good
while
sometimes
till
the
maiden
of
the
next
year
is
brought
in
the
writer
of
this
book
witnessed
the
ceremony
of
cutting
the
maiden
at
balquhidder
in
september
a
lady
friend
informed
me
that
as
a
young
girl
she
cut
the
maiden
several
times
at
the
request
of
the
reapers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
perth
the
name
of
the
maiden
was
given
to
the
last
handful
of
standing
corn
a
reaper
held
the
top
of
the
bunch
while
she
cut
it
afterwards
the
bunch
was
plaited
decked
with
ribbons
and
hung
up
in
a
conspicuous
place
on
the
wall
of
the
kitchen
till
the
next
maiden
was
brought
in
the
in
this
neighbourhood
was
also
called
the
maiden
the
reapers
danced
at
it
in
the
highland
district
of
lochaber
dancing
and
on
the
last
night
of
harvest
used
to
be
universal
and
are
still
generally
observed
here
we
are
told
the
festivity
without
the
maiden
would
be
like
a
wedding
without
the
bride
the
maiden
is
carried
home
with
tumultuous
rejoicing
and
after
being
suitably
decorated
is
hung
up
in
the
barn
where
the
dancing
usually
takes
place
when
supper
is
over
one
of
the
company
generally
the
oldest
man
present
drinks
a
glass
of
whisky
after
turning
to
the
suspended
sheaf
and
saying
here
s
to
the
the
company
follow
his
example
each
in
turn
drinking
to
the
maiden
then
the
dancing
begins
on
some
farms
on
the
gareloch
in
dumbartonshire
about
the
year
the
last
handful
of
standing
corn
was
called
the
maiden
it
was
divided
in
two
plaited
and
then
cut
with
the
sickle
by
a
girl
who
it
was
thought
would
be
lucky
and
would
soon
be
married
when
it
was
cut
the
reapers
gathered
together
and
threw
their
sickles
in
the
air
the
maiden
was
dressed
with
ribbons
and
hung
in
the
kitchen
near
the
roof
where
it
was
kept
for
several
years
with
the
date
attached
sometimes
five
or
six
maidens
might
be
seen
hanging
at
once
on
hooks
the
was
called
the
kirn
in
other
farms
on
the
gareloch
the
last
handful
of
corn
was
called
the
maidenhead
or
the
head
it
was
neatly
plaited
sometimes
decked
with
ribbons
and
hung
in
the
kitchen
for
a
year
when
the
grain
was
given
to
the
poultry
in
the
of
aberdeenshire
the
customs
connected
with
the
last
corn
cut
at
harvest
have
been
carefully
collected
and
recorded
by
the
late
rev
walter
gregor
of
pitsligo
his
account
runs
as
follows
the
last
sheaf
cut
is
the
object
of
much
care
the
manner
of
cutting
it
binding
it
and
carrying
it
to
the
house
varies
a
little
in
the
different
districts
the
following
customs
have
been
reported
to
me
by
people
who
have
seen
them
or
who
have
practised
them
and
some
of
the
customs
have
now
disappeared
the
information
comes
from
the
parishes
of
pitsligo
aberdour
and
tyrie
situated
in
the
corner
of
the
county
of
aberdeen
but
the
customs
are
not
limited
to
these
parishes
some
particulars
relating
to
the
sheaf
may
be
noted
as
always
the
same
thus
it
is
cut
and
gathered
by
the
youngest
person
present
in
the
field
the
person
who
is
supposed
to
be
the
purest
the
sheaf
is
not
allowed
to
touch
the
ground
it
is
made
up
and
carried
in
triumph
to
the
house
it
occupies
a
conspicuous
place
in
the
festivals
which
follow
the
end
of
the
reaping
it
is
kept
till
christmas
morning
and
is
then
given
to
one
or
more
of
the
horses
or
to
the
cattle
of
the
farm
before
the
introduction
of
the
scythe
the
corn
was
cut
by
the
sickle
or
a
kind
of
curved
sickle
the
last
sheaf
was
shorn
or
cut
by
the
youngest
girl
present
as
the
corn
might
not
touch
the
ground
the
master
or
gueedman
sat
down
placed
the
band
on
his
knees
and
received
thereupon
each
handful
as
it
was
cut
the
sheaf
was
bound
dressed
as
a
woman
and
when
it
had
been
brought
to
the
house
it
was
placed
in
some
part
of
the
kitchen
where
everybody
could
see
it
during
the
meal
which
followed
the
end
of
the
reaping
this
sheaf
was
called
the
sheaf
the
manner
of
receiving
and
binding
the
last
sheaf
is
not
always
the
same
here
is
another
three
persons
hold
the
band
in
their
hands
one
of
them
at
each
end
while
the
third
holds
the
knot
in
the
middle
each
handful
of
corn
is
placed
so
that
the
cut
end
is
turned
to
the
breast
of
those
who
support
the
ears
on
the
opposite
side
when
all
is
cut
the
youngest
boy
ties
the
knot
two
other
bands
are
fastened
to
the
sheaf
one
near
the
cut
end
the
other
near
the
ears
the
sheaf
is
carried
to
the
house
by
those
who
have
helped
to
cut
or
bind
it
aberdour
since
the
introduction
of
the
scythe
it
is
the
youngest
boy
who
cuts
the
last
sheaf
my
informant
a
woman
told
me
that
when
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
wield
the
scythe
his
hand
was
guided
by
another
the
youngest
girl
gathers
it
when
it
is
bound
with
three
bands
it
is
cut
straight
and
it
is
not
allowed
to
touch
the
ground
the
youngest
girls
carry
it
to
the
house
my
informant
a
woman
told
me
that
she
had
seen
it
decked
and
placed
at
the
head
of
the
bed
formerly
and
still
sometimes
there
was
always
a
bed
in
the
kitchen
tyrie
the
corn
is
not
allowed
to
fall
on
the
ground
the
young
girls
who
gather
it
take
it
by
the
ear
and
convey
it
handful
by
handful
till
the
whole
sheaf
is
cut
a
woman
who
has
lost
a
feather
of
her
wing
as
an
old
woman
put
it
to
me
may
not
touch
it
sometimes
also
they
merely
put
the
two
hands
round
the
sheaf
new
deer
generally
a
feast
and
dance
follow
when
all
the
wheat
is
cut
this
feast
and
dance
bear
the
name
of
or
meal
and
however
some
people
do
not
give
meal
and
ale
till
all
the
cut
corn
has
been
got
in
then
the
feast
is
called
the
winter
and
they
say
that
a
farmer
has
the
winter
when
all
his
sheaves
have
been
carried
home
at
this
feast
two
things
are
indispensable
a
cheese
called
the
and
meal
and
the
cheese
must
be
cut
by
the
master
of
the
house
the
first
slice
is
larger
than
the
rest
it
is
known
by
the
name
of
the
s
young
man
s
big
is
generally
the
share
of
the
herd
boy
tyrie
the
dish
called
meal
and
ale
is
made
as
follows
you
take
a
suitable
vessel
whether
an
earthenware
pot
or
a
if
the
crockery
is
scanty
but
if
on
the
contrary
the
family
is
well
off
they
use
other
special
utensils
in
each
dish
ale
is
poured
and
treacle
is
added
to
sweeten
it
then
oatmeal
is
mixed
with
the
sweetened
ale
till
the
whole
is
of
a
sufficient
consistency
the
cook
adds
whisky
to
the
mixture
in
such
proportion
as
she
thinks
fit
in
each
plate
is
put
a
ring
to
allow
the
meal
time
to
be
completely
absorbed
the
dish
is
prepared
on
the
morning
of
the
feast
at
the
moment
of
the
feast
the
dish
or
dishes
containing
the
strong
and
savoury
mixture
are
set
on
the
middle
of
the
table
but
it
is
not
served
up
till
the
end
six
or
seven
persons
generally
have
a
plate
to
themselves
each
of
them
plunges
his
spoon
into
the
plate
as
fast
as
possible
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
ring
for
he
who
is
lucky
enough
to
get
it
will
be
married
within
the
year
meantime
some
of
the
stuff
is
swallowed
but
often
in
the
struggle
some
of
it
is
spilt
on
the
table
or
the
floor
in
some
districts
there
used
to
be
and
still
is
dancing
in
the
evening
of
the
feast
the
sheaf
figured
in
the
dances
it
was
dressed
as
a
girl
and
carried
on
the
back
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
to
the
barn
or
granary
which
served
as
a
ballroom
the
mistress
danced
a
reel
with
the
sheaf
on
her
back
the
woman
who
gave
me
this
account
had
been
a
witness
of
what
she
described
when
she
was
a
girl
the
sheaf
was
afterwards
carefully
stored
till
the
first
day
of
christmas
when
it
was
given
to
eat
to
a
mare
in
foal
if
there
was
one
on
the
farm
or
if
there
was
not
to
the
oldest
cow
in
calf
elsewhere
the
sheaf
was
divided
between
all
the
cows
and
their
calves
or
between
all
the
horses
and
the
cattle
of
the
farm
related
by
an
in
these
aberdeenshire
customs
the
sanctity
attributed
to
the
last
corn
cut
at
harvest
is
clearly
manifested
not
merely
by
the
ceremony
with
which
it
is
treated
on
the
field
in
the
house
and
in
the
barn
but
also
by
the
great
care
taken
to
prevent
it
from
touching
the
ground
or
being
handled
by
any
unchaste
person
the
reason
why
the
youngest
person
on
the
field
whether
a
girl
or
a
boy
is
chosen
to
cut
the
last
standing
corn
and
sometimes
to
carry
it
to
the
house
is
no
doubt
a
calculation
that
the
younger
the
person
the
more
likely
is
he
or
she
to
be
sexually
pure
we
have
seen
that
for
this
reason
some
negroes
entrust
the
sowing
of
the
seed
to
very
young
girls
and
later
on
we
shall
meet
with
more
evidence
in
africa
of
the
notion
that
the
corn
may
be
handled
only
by
the
pure
and
in
the
gruel
of
and
ale
which
the
harvesters
sup
with
spoons
as
an
indispensable
part
of
the
harvest
supper
have
we
not
the
scotch
equivalent
of
the
gruel
of
and
water
flavoured
with
pennyroyal
which
the
initiates
at
eleusis
drank
as
a
solemn
form
of
communion
with
the
barley
goddess
demeter
may
not
that
mystic
sacrament
have
originated
in
a
simple
harvest
supper
held
by
eleusinian
farmers
at
the
end
of
the
reaping
according
to
a
briefer
account
of
the
aberdeenshire
custom
the
last
sheaf
cut
or
maiden
is
carried
home
in
merry
procession
by
the
harvesters
it
is
then
presented
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
dresses
it
up
to
be
preserved
till
the
first
mare
foals
the
maiden
is
then
taken
down
and
presented
to
the
mare
as
its
first
food
the
neglect
of
this
would
have
untoward
effects
upon
the
foal
and
disastrous
consequences
upon
farm
operations
generally
for
the
in
fifeshire
the
last
handful
of
corn
known
as
the
maiden
is
cut
by
a
young
girl
and
made
into
the
rude
figure
of
a
doll
tied
with
ribbons
by
which
it
is
hung
on
the
wall
of
the
till
the
next
spring
the
custom
of
cutting
the
maiden
at
harvest
was
also
observed
in
and
sutherlandshire
a
somewhat
maturer
but
still
youthful
age
is
assigned
to
the
by
the
appellations
of
bride
and
which
in
germany
are
sometimes
bestowed
both
on
the
last
sheaf
and
on
the
woman
who
binds
it
at
near
müglitz
in
moravia
a
small
portion
of
the
wheat
is
left
standing
after
all
the
rest
has
been
reaped
this
remnant
is
then
cut
amid
the
rejoicing
of
the
reapers
by
a
young
girl
who
wears
a
wreath
of
wheaten
ears
on
her
head
and
goes
by
the
name
of
the
it
is
supposed
that
she
will
be
a
real
bride
that
same
year
in
the
upland
valley
of
alpach
in
north
tyrol
the
person
who
brings
the
last
sheaf
into
the
granary
is
said
to
have
the
or
the
according
to
the
crop
and
is
received
with
great
demonstrations
of
respect
and
rejoicing
the
people
of
the
farm
go
out
to
meet
him
bells
are
rung
and
refreshments
offered
to
him
on
a
tray
in
austrian
silesia
a
girl
is
chosen
to
be
the
and
much
honour
is
paid
to
her
at
the
near
roslin
and
stonehaven
in
scotland
the
last
handful
of
corn
cut
got
the
name
of
the
bride
and
she
was
placed
over
the
or
she
had
a
ribbon
tied
below
her
numerous
and
another
round
her
sometimes
the
idea
implied
by
the
name
of
bride
is
worked
out
more
fully
by
representing
the
productive
powers
of
vegetation
as
bride
and
bridegroom

instances
the

personified
in
double

as

sometimes
the
spirit
appears
in
a
double
female
form
as
both
old
and
young
corresponding
exactly
to
the
greek
demeter
and
persephone
if
my
interpretation
of
these
goddesses
is
right
we
have
seen
that
in
scotland
especially
among
the
population
the
last
corn
cut
is
sometimes
called
the
old
wife
and
sometimes
the
maiden
now
there
are
parts
of
scotland
in
which
both
an
old
wife
and
a
maiden
are
cut
at
harvest
as
the
accounts
of
this
custom
are
not
quite
clear
and
consistent
it
may
be
well
to
give
them
first
in
the
words
of
the
original
authorities
thus
the
late
sheriff
alexander
nicolson
tells
us
that
there
is
a
gaelic
proverb
a
balk
in
autumn
is
better
than
a
sheaf
the
more
and
he
explains
it
by
saying
that
a
or
balk
is
a
strip
of
a
left
fallow
the
fear
of
being
left
with
the
last
sheaf
of
the
harvest
called
the
or
always
led
to
an
exciting
competition
among
the
reapers
in
the
last
field
the
reaper
who
came
on
a
would
of
course
be
glad
to
have
so
much
the
less
to
in
further
explanation
of
the
proverb
the
writer
adds
the
customs
as
to
the
and
seem
to
have
varied
somewhat
two
reapers
were
usually
set
to
each
rig
and
according
to
one
account
the
man
who
was
first
done
got
the
or
while
the
man
who
was
last
got
the
or
old
the
latter
term
is
used
in
argyleshire
the
term
the
lame
goat
is
used
in
skye
according
to
what
appears
to
be
the
better
version
the
competition
to
avoid
the
was
not
between
reapers
but
between
neighbouring
crofters
and
the
man
who
got
his
harvest
done
first
sent
a
handful
of
corn
called
the
to
his
neighbour
who
passed
it
on
till
it
landed
with
him
who
was
latest
that
man
s
penalty
was
to
provide
for
the
dearth
of
the
township
a
in
the
ensuing
season
the
again
was
the
last
cut
handful
of
oats
on
a
croft
or
farm
and
was
an
object
of
lively
competition
among
the
reapers
it
was
tastefully
tied
up
with
ribbons
generally
dressed
like
a
doll
and
then
hung
up
on
a
nail
till
spring
on
the
first
day
of
ploughing
it
was
solemnly
taken
down
and
given
as
a
or
handsel
to
the
horses
for
luck
it
was
meant
as
a
symbol
that
the
harvest
had
been
secured
and
to
ward
off
the
fairies
representatives
of
the
ethereal
and
unsubstantial
till
the
time
came
to
provide
for
a
new
again
the
rev
campbell
of
kilchrenan
on
loch
awe
furnished
maclagan
with
the
following
account
of
the
highland
customs
at
harvest
the
recollections
of
maccorquodale
then
resident
at
kilchrenan
refer
to
the
customs
practised
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
wild
and
gloomy
valley
of
glencoe
infamous
in
history
for
the
treacherous
massacre
perpetrated
there
by
the
government
troops
in
mrs
maccorquodale
says
that
the
rivalry
was
for
the
maiden
and
for
the
privilege
she
gave
of
sending
the
cailleach
to
the
next
neighbour
the
maiden
was
represented
by
the
last
stalks
reaped
the
cailleach
by
a
handful
taken
at
random
from
the
field
perhaps
the
last
rig
of
the
reaper
last
to
finish
the
cailleach
was
not
dressed
but
carried
after
binding
to
the
neighbour
s
field
the
maiden
was
cut
in
the
following
manner
all
the
reapers
gathered
round
her
and
kept
a
short
distance
from
her
they
then
threw
their
hooks
sickles
at
her
the
person
successful
in
cutting
her
down
in
this
manner
was
the
man
whose
possession
she
became
maccorquodale
understood
that
the
man
of
a
township
who
got
the
cailleach
finally
was
supposed
to
be
doomed
to
poverty
for
his
want
of
energy
gaelic
a
sample
of
the
toast
to
the
cailleach
at
the
harvest
entertainment
was
as
follows
the
cailleach
is
with
and
is
now
with
me
since
i
was
the
last
i
drink
to
her
health
since
she
assisted
me
in
harvest
it
is
likely
that
it
is
with
me
she
will
abide
during
the
in
explaining
the
above
toast
campbell
says
that
it
signifies
that
the
cailleach
is
always
with
agriculturists
she
has
been
with
others
before
and
is
now
with
me
the
proposer
of
the
toast
though
i
did
my
best
to
avoid
her
i
welcome
her
as
my
assistant
and
am
prepared
to
entertain
her
during
the
another
form
of
the
toast
was
as
follows
to
your
health
good
wife
who
for
harvest
has
come
to
help
us
and
if
i
live
i
ll
try
to
support
you
when
winter
john
maccorquodale
kilchrenan
says
that
at
crianlarich
in
strath
fillan
they
make
a
cailleach
of
sticks
and
a
turnip
old
clothes
and
a
pipe
in
this
case
the
effigy
passed
in
succession
to
seven
farms
which
he
mentioned
and
finally
settled
with
an
innkeeper
the
list
suggested
that
the
upper
farms
stood
a
bad
chance
and
perhaps
that
a
prosperous
innkeeper
could
more
easily
bear
up
against
the
reproach
and
loss
of
supporting
the
cailleach
duncan
macintyre
kilchrenan
says
that
in
one
case
where
the
last
field
to
be
reaped
was
the
most
fertile
land
on
the
farm
the
corn
first
cut
in
it
which
was
taken
near
the
edge
was
reserved
to
make
a
cailleach
should
the
owner
be
so
happy
as
to
be
able
to
pass
her
on
to
his
neighbour
the
last
blades
cut
were
generally
in
the
middle
or
best
part
of
the
field
these
in
any
event
became
the
lastly
maclagan
observes
that
having
directed
the
attention
of
miss
kerr
port
charlotte
islay
to
the
practice
of
having
two
different
bunches
on
the
mainland
of
argyle
she
informs
me
that
in
islay
and
kintyre
the
last
handful
is
the
cailleach
and
they
have
no
maiden
the
same
is
the
custom
in
bernara
and
other
parts
of
the
western
isles
while
in
mull
the
last
handful
is
the
maiden
and
they
have
no
cailleach
in
north
uist
the
habit
still
prevails
of
putting
the
cailleach
among
the
standing
corn
of
lazy
the
general
rule
to
which
these
various
accounts
point
seems
to
be
that
where
both
a
maiden
and
an
old
wife
are
fashioned
out
of
the
reaped
corn
at
harvest
the
maiden
is
always
made
out
of
the
last
stalks
left
standing
and
is
kept
by
the
farmer
on
whose
land
it
was
cut
while
the
old
wife
is
made
out
of
other
stalks
sometimes
out
of
the
first
stalks
cut
and
is
regularly
passed
on
to
a
laggard
farmer
who
happens
to
be
still
reaping
after
his
brisker
neighbour
has
cut
all
his
corn
thus
while
each
farmer
keeps
his
own
maiden
as
the
embodiment
of
the
young
and
fruitful
spirit
of
the
corn
he
passes
on
the
old
wife
as
soon
as
he
can
to
a
neighbour
and
so
the
old
lady
may
make
the
round
of
all
the
farms
in
the
district
before
she
finds
a
place
in
which
to
lay
her
venerable
head
the
farmer
with
whom
she
finally
takes
up
her
abode
is
of
course
the
one
who
has
been
the
last
of
all
the
countryside
to
finish
reaping
his
crops
and
thus
the
distinction
of
entertaining
her
is
rather
an
invidious
one
similarly
we
saw
that
in
pembrokeshire
where
the
last
corn
cut
is
called
not
the
maiden
but
the
hag
she
is
passed
on
hastily
to
a
neighbour
who
is
still
at
work
in
his
fields
and
who
receives
his
aged
visitor
with
anything
but
a
transport
of
joy
if
the
old
wife
represents
the
of
the
past
year
as
she
probably
does
wherever
she
is
contrasted
with
and
opposed
to
a
maiden
it
is
natural
enough
that
her
faded
charms
should
have
less
attractions
for
the
husbandman
than
the
buxom
form
of
her
daughter
who
may
be
expected
to
become
in
her
turn
the
mother
of
the
golden
grain
when
the
revolving
year
has
brought
round
another
autumn
the
same
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
effete
mother
of
the
corn
by
palming
her
off
on
other
people
comes
out
clearly
in
some
of
the
customs
observed
at
the
close
of
threshing
particularly
in
the
practice
of
passing
on
a
hideous
straw
puppet
to
a
neighbour
farmer
who
is
still
threshing
his
corn
the
harvest
customs
just
described
are
strikingly
analogous
to
the
spring
customs
which
we
reviewed
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
as
in
the
spring
customs
the
is
represented
both
by
a
tree
and
by
a
person
so
in
the
harvest
customs
the
is
represented
both
by
the
last
sheaf
and
by
the
person
who
cuts
or
binds
or
threshes
it
the
equivalence
of
the
person
to
the
sheaf
is
shewn
by
giving
him
or
her
the
same
name
as
the
sheaf
by
wrapping
him
or
her
in
it
and
by
the
rule
observed
in
some
places
that
when
the
sheaf
is
called
the
mother
it
must
be
made
up
into
human
shape
by
the
oldest
married
woman
but
that
when
it
is
called
the
maiden
it
must
be
cut
by
the
youngest
girl
here
the
age
of
the
personal
representative
of
the
corresponds
with
that
of
the
supposed
age
of
the
just
as
the
human
victims
offered
by
the
mexicans
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
maize
varied
with
the
age
of
the
maize
for
in
the
mexican
as
in
the
european
custom
the
human
beings
were
probably
representatives
of
the
rather
than
victims
offered
to
it
again
the
same
fertilising
influence
which
the
is
supposed
to
exert
over
vegetation
cattle
and
even
women
is
ascribed
to
the
thus
its
supposed
influence
on
vegetation
is
shewn
by
the
practice
of
taking
some
of
the
grain
of
the
last
sheaf
in
which
the
is
regularly
supposed
to
be
present
and
scattering
it
among
the
young
corn
in
spring
or
mixing
it
with
the
its
influence
on
animals
is
shewn
by
giving
the
last
sheaf
to
a
mare
in
foal
to
a
cow
in
calf
and
to
horses
at
the
first
ploughing
lastly
its
influence
on
women
is
indicated
by
the
custom
of
delivering
the
made
into
the
likeness
of
a
pregnant
woman
to
the
farmer
s
wife
by
the
belief
that
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
will
have
a
child
next
year
perhaps
too
by
the
idea
that
the
person
who
gets
it
will
soon
be
married
plainly
therefore
these
spring
and
harvest
customs
are
based
on
the
same
ancient
modes
of
thought
and
form
parts
of
the
same
primitive
heathendom
which
was
doubtless
practised
by
our
forefathers
long
before
the
dawn
of
history
amongst
the
marks
of
a
primitive
ritual
we
may
note
the
following
no
special
class
of
persons
is
set
apart
for
the
performance
of
the
rites
in
other
words
there
are
no
priests
the
rites
may
be
performed
by
any
one
as
occasion
demands
no
special
places
are
set
apart
for
the
performance
of
the
rites
in
other
words
there
are
no
temples
the
rites
may
be
performed
anywhere
as
occasion
demands
spirits
not
gods
are
recognised
as
distinguished
from
gods
spirits
are
restricted
in
their
operations
to
definite
departments
of
nature
their
names
are
general
not
proper
their
attributes
are
generic
rather
than
individual
in
other
words
there
is
an
indefinite
number
of
spirits
of
each
class
and
the
individuals
of
a
class
are
all
much
alike
they
have
no
definitely
marked
individuality
no
accepted
traditions
are
current
as
to
their
origin
life
adventures
and
character
on
the
other
hand
gods
as
distinguished
from
spirits
are
not
restricted
to
definite
departments
of
nature
it
is
true
that
there
is
generally
some
one
department
over
which
they
preside
as
their
special
province
but
they
are
not
rigorously
confined
to
it
they
can
exert
their
power
for
good
or
evil
in
many
other
spheres
of
nature
and
life
again
they
bear
individual
or
proper
names
such
as
demeter
persephone
dionysus
and
their
individual
characters
and
histories
are
fixed
by
current
myths
and
the
representations
of
art
the
rites
are
magical
rather
than
propitiatory
in
other
words
the
desired
objects
are
attained
not
by
propitiating
the
favour
of
divine
beings
through
sacrifice
prayer
and
praise
but
by
ceremonies
which
as
i
have
already
explained
are
believed
to
influence
the
course
of
nature
directly
through
a
physical
sympathy
or
resemblance
between
the
rite
and
the
effect
which
it
is
the
intention
of
the
rite
to
produce
judged
by
these
tests
the
spring
and
harvest
customs
of
our
european
peasantry
deserve
to
rank
as
primitive
for
no
special
class
of
persons
and
no
special
places
are
set
exclusively
apart
for
their
performance
they
may
be
performed
by
any
one
master
or
man
mistress
or
maid
boy
or
girl
they
are
practised
not
in
temples
or
churches
but
in
the
woods
and
meadows
beside
brooks
in
barns
on
harvest
fields
and
cottage
floors
the
supernatural
beings
whose
existence
is
taken
for
granted
in
them
are
spirits
rather
than
deities
their
functions
are
limited
to
certain
departments
of
nature
their
names
are
general
like
the
the
old
woman
the
maiden
not
proper
names
like
demeter
persephone
dionysus
their
generic
attributes
are
known
but
their
individual
histories
and
characters
are
not
the
subject
of
myths
for
they
exist
in
classes
rather
than
as
individuals
and
the
members
of
each
class
are
indistinguishable
for
example
every
farm
has
its
or
its
old
woman
or
its
maiden
but
every
is
much
like
every
other
and
so
with
the
old
women
and
maidens
lastly
in
these
harvest
as
in
the
spring
customs
the
ritual
is
magical
rather
than
propitiatory
this
is
shewn
by
throwing
the
into
the
river
in
order
to
secure
rain
and
dew
for
the
crops
by
making
the
old
woman
heavy
in
order
to
get
a
heavy
crop
next
year
by
strewing
grain
from
the
last
sheaf
amongst
the
young
crops
in
spring
and
by
giving
the
last
sheaf
to
the
cattle
to
make
them
thrive
chapter
vi
the
in
many
lands
the
in
america
european
peoples
ancient
and
modern
have
not
been
singular
in
personifying
the
corn
as
a
mother
goddess
the
same
simple
idea
has
suggested
itself
to
other
agricultural
races
in
distant
parts
of
the
world
and
has
been
applied
by
them
to
other
indigenous
cereals
than
barley
and
wheat
if
europe
has
its
and
its
america
has
its
and
the
east
indies
their
these
personifications
i
will
now
illustrate
beginning
with
the
american
personification
of
the
maize
we
have
seen
that
among
european
peoples
it
is
a
common
custom
to
keep
the
plaited
of
the
last
sheaf
or
the
puppet
which
is
formed
out
of
them
in
the
from
harvest
to
harvest
the
intention
no
doubt
is
or
rather
originally
was
by
preserving
the
representative
of
the
to
maintain
the
spirit
itself
in
life
and
activity
throughout
the
year
in
order
that
the
corn
may
grow
and
the
crops
be
good
this
interpretation
of
the
custom
is
at
all
events
rendered
highly
probable
by
a
similar
custom
observed
by
the
ancient
peruvians
and
thus
described
by
the
old
spanish
historian
acosta
they
take
a
certain
portion
of
the
most
fruitful
of
the
maize
that
grows
in
their
farms
the
which
they
put
in
a
certain
granary
which
they
do
call
with
certain
ceremonies
watching
three
nights
they
put
this
maize
in
the
richest
garments
they
have
and
being
thus
wrapped
and
dressed
they
worship
this
and
hold
it
in
great
veneration
saying
it
is
the
mother
of
the
maize
of
their
inheritances
and
that
by
this
means
the
maize
augments
and
is
preserved
in
this
month
the
sixth
month
answering
to
may
they
make
a
particular
sacrifice
and
the
witches
demand
of
this
if
it
hath
strength
sufficient
to
continue
until
the
next
year
and
if
it
answers
no
then
they
carry
this
maize
to
the
farm
to
burn
whence
they
brought
it
according
to
every
man
s
power
then
they
make
another
with
the
same
ceremonies
saying
that
they
renew
it
to
the
end
the
seed
of
maize
may
not
perish
and
if
it
answers
that
it
hath
force
sufficient
to
last
longer
they
leave
it
until
the
next
year
this
foolish
vanity
continueth
to
this
day
and
it
is
very
common
amongst
the
indians
to
have
these
in
this
description
of
the
custom
there
seems
to
be
some
error
probably
it
was
the
bunch
of
maize
not
the
granary
which
was
worshipped
by
the
peruvians
and
regarded
as
the
mother
of
the
maize
this
is
confirmed
by
what
we
know
of
the
peruvian
custom
from
another
source
the
peruvians
we
are
told
believed
all
useful
plants
to
be
animated
by
a
divine
being
who
causes
their
growth
according
to
the
particular
plant
these
divine
beings
were
called
the
the
the
and
the
figures
of
these
divine
mothers
were
made
respectively
of
ears
of
maize
and
leaves
of
the
quinoa
and
coca
plants
they
were
dressed
in
women
s
clothes
and
worshipped
thus
the
was
represented
by
a
puppet
made
of
stalks
of
maize
dressed
in
full
female
attire
and
the
indians
believed
that
as
mother
it
had
the
power
of
producing
and
giving
birth
to
much
probably
therefore
acosta
misunderstood
his
informant
and
the
mother
of
the
maize
which
he
describes
was
not
the
granary
but
the
bunch
of
maize
dressed
in
rich
vestments
the
peruvian
mother
of
the
maize
like
the
at
balquhidder
was
kept
for
a
year
in
order
that
by
her
means
the
corn
might
grow
and
multiply
but
lest
her
strength
might
not
suffice
to
last
till
the
next
harvest
she
was
asked
in
the
course
of
the
year
how
she
felt
and
if
she
answered
that
she
felt
weak
she
was
burned
and
a
fresh
mother
of
the
maize
made
to
the
end
the
seed
of
maize
may
not
here
it
may
be
observed
we
have
a
strong
confirmation
of
the
explanation
already
given
of
the
custom
of
killing
the
god
both
periodically
and
occasionally
the
mother
of
the
maize
was
allowed
as
a
rule
to
live
through
a
year
that
being
the
period
during
which
her
strength
might
reasonably
be
supposed
to
last
unimpaired
but
on
any
symptom
of
her
strength
failing
she
was
put
to
death
and
a
fresh
and
vigorous
mother
of
the
maize
took
her
place
lest
the
maize
which
depended
on
her
for
its
existence
should
languish
and
decay
hardly
less
clearly
does
the
same
train
of
thought
come
out
in
the
harvest
customs
formerly
observed
by
the
zapotecs
of
mexico
at
harvest
the
priests
attended
by
the
nobles
and
people
went
in
procession
to
the
maize
fields
where
they
picked
out
the
largest
and
finest
sheaf
this
they
took
with
great
ceremony
to
the
town
or
village
and
placed
it
in
the
temple
upon
an
altar
adorned
with
wild
flowers
after
sacrificing
to
the
harvest
god
the
priests
carefully
wrapped
up
the
sheaf
in
fine
linen
and
kept
it
till
then
the
priests
and
nobles
met
again
at
the
temple
one
of
them
bringing
the
skin
of
a
wild
beast
elaborately
ornamented
in
which
the
linen
cloth
containing
the
sheaf
was
enveloped
the
sheaf
was
then
carried
once
more
in
procession
to
the
field
from
which
it
had
been
taken
here
a
small
cavity
or
subterranean
chamber
had
been
prepared
in
which
the
precious
sheaf
was
deposited
wrapt
in
its
various
envelopes
after
sacrifice
had
been
offered
to
the
gods
of
the
fields
for
an
abundant
crop
the
chamber
was
closed
and
covered
over
with
earth
immediately
thereafter
the
sowing
began
finally
when
the
time
of
harvest
drew
near
the
buried
sheaf
was
solemnly
disinterred
by
the
priests
who
distributed
the
grain
to
all
who
asked
for
it
the
packets
of
grain
so
distributed
were
carefully
preserved
as
talismans
till
the
harvest
in
these
ceremonies
which
continued
to
be
annually
celebrated
long
after
the
spanish
conquest
the
intention
of
keeping
the
finest
sheaf
buried
in
the
maize
field
from
to
harvest
was
undoubtedly
to
quicken
the
growth
of
the
maize
a
fuller
and
to
some
extent
different
account
of
the
ancient
mexican
worship
of
the
maize
has
been
given
us
by
the
franciscan
monk
bernardino
de
sahagun
who
arrived
in
mexico
in
only
eight
years
after
its
conquest
by
the
spaniards
and
devoted
the
remaining
years
of
his
long
life
to
labouring
among
the
indians
for
their
moral
and
spiritual
good
uniting
the
curiosity
of
a
scientific
enquirer
to
the
zeal
of
a
missionary
and
adorning
both
qualities
with
the
humanity
and
benevolence
of
a
good
man
he
obtained
from
the
oldest
and
most
learned
of
the
indians
accounts
of
their
ancient
customs
and
beliefs
and
embodied
them
in
a
work
which
for
combined
interest
of
matter
and
fulness
of
detail
has
perhaps
never
been
equalled
in
the
records
of
aboriginal
peoples
brought
into
contact
with
european
civilisation
this
great
document
after
lying
neglected
in
the
dust
of
spanish
archives
for
centuries
was
discovered
and
published
almost
simultaneously
in
mexico
and
england
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
exists
in
the
double
form
of
an
aztec
text
and
a
spanish
translation
both
due
to
sahagun
himself
only
the
spanish
version
has
hitherto
been
published
in
full
but
the
original
aztec
text
to
judge
by
the
few
extracts
of
it
which
have
been
edited
and
translated
appears
to
furnish
much
more
ample
details
on
many
points
and
in
the
interest
of
learning
it
is
greatly
to
be
desired
that
a
complete
edition
and
translation
of
it
should
be
given
to
the
world
fortunately
among
the
sections
of
this
great
work
which
have
been
edited
and
translated
from
the
aztec
original
into
german
by
professor
eduard
seler
of
berlin
is
a
long
one
describing
the
religious
festivals
of
the
ancient
mexican
calendar
from
it
we
learn
some
valuable
particulars
as
to
the
worship
of
the
and
the
ceremonies
observed
by
the
mexicans
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
a
good
crop
of
maize
the
festival
was
the
fourth
of
the
aztec
year
and
went
by
the
name
of
the
great
vigil
it
fell
on
a
date
which
corresponds
to
the
seventh
of
april
the
name
of
the
was
chicome
couatl
and
the
mexicans
conceived
and
represented
her
in
the
form
of
a
woman
red
in
face
and
arms
and
legs
wearing
a
paper
crown
dyed
vermilion
and
clad
in
garments
of
the
hue
of
ripe
cherries
no
doubt
the
red
colour
of
the
goddess
and
her
garments
referred
to
the
deep
orange
hue
of
the
ripe
maize
it
was
like
the
yellow
hair
of
the
greek
demeter
she
was
supposed
to
make
all
kinds
of
maize
beans
and
vegetables
to
grow
on
the
day
of
the
festival
the
mexicans
sent
out
to
the
and
fetched
from
every
field
a
plant
of
maize
which
they
brought
to
their
houses
and
greeted
as
their
setting
them
up
in
their
dwellings
clothing
them
in
garments
and
placing
food
before
them
and
after
sunset
they
carried
the
to
the
temple
of
the
where
they
snatched
them
from
one
another
and
fought
and
struck
each
other
with
them
further
at
this
festival
they
brought
to
the
temple
of
the
the
which
were
to
be
used
in
the
sowing
the
cobs
were
carried
by
three
maidens
in
bundles
of
seven
wrapt
in
red
paper
one
of
the
girls
was
small
with
short
hair
another
was
older
with
long
hair
hanging
down
and
the
third
was
with
her
hair
wound
round
her
head
red
feathers
were
gummed
to
the
arms
and
legs
of
the
three
maidens
and
their
faces
were
painted
probably
to
resemble
the
red
whom
they
may
be
supposed
to
have
personated
at
various
stages
of
the
growth
of
the
corn
the
which
they
brought
to
the
temple
of
the
were
called
by
the
name
of
the
cinteotl
and
they
were
afterwards
deposited
in
the
granary
and
kept
there
as
the
heart
of
the
granary
till
the
sowing
time
came
round
when
they
were
used
as
seed
the
eastern
indians
of
north
america
who
subsisted
to
a
large
extent
by
the
cultivation
of
maize
generally
conceived
the
spirit
of
the
maize
as
a
woman
and
supposed
that
the
plant
itself
had
sprung
originally
from
the
blood
drops
or
the
dead
body
of
the
corn
woman
in
the
sacred
formulas
of
the
cherokee
the
corn
is
sometimes
invoked
as
the
old
woman
and
one
of
their
myths
relates
how
a
hunter
saw
a
fair
woman
issue
from
a
single
green
stalk
of
corn
the
iroquois
believe
the
spirit
of
the
corn
the
spirit
of
beans
and
the
spirit
of
squashes
to
be
three
sisters
clad
in
the
leaves
of
their
respective
plants
very
fond
of
each
other
and
delighting
to
dwell
together
this
divine
trinity
is
known
by
the
name
of
which
means
our
life
or
our
the
three
persons
of
the
trinity
have
no
individual
names
and
are
never
mentioned
separately
except
by
means
of
description
the
indians
have
a
legend
that
of
old
the
corn
was
easily
cultivated
yielded
abundantly
and
had
a
grain
exceedingly
rich
in
oil
till
the
evil
one
envious
of
this
good
gift
of
the
great
spirit
to
man
went
forth
into
the
fields
and
blighted
them
and
still
when
the
wind
rustles
in
the
corn
the
pious
indian
fancies
he
hears
the
spirit
of
the
corn
bemoaning
her
blighted
fruitfulness
the
huichol
indians
of
mexico
imagine
maize
to
be
a
little
girl
who
may
sometimes
be
heard
weeping
in
the
fields
so
afraid
is
she
of
the
wild
beasts
that
eat
the
corn
the
in
the
punjaub
in
the
punjaub
to
the
east
of
the
jumna
when
the
cotton
boles
begin
to
burst
it
is
usual
to
select
the
largest
plant
in
the
field
sprinkle
it
with
and
and
then
bind
to
it
pieces
of
cotton
taken
from
the
other
plants
of
the
field
this
selected
plant
is
called
sirdar
or
that
is
from
a
name
sometimes
given
to
a
large
and
for
a
mother
and
after
it
has
been
saluted
prayers
are
offered
that
the
other
plants
may
resemble
it
in
the
richness
of
their
produce
the
barley
bride
among
the
berbers
the
conception
of
the
as
a
bride
seems
to
come
out
clearly
in
a
ceremony
still
practised
by
the
berbers
near
tangier
in
morocco
when
the
women
assemble
in
the
fields
to
weed
the
green
barley
or
reap
the
crops
they
take
with
them
a
straw
figure
dressed
like
a
woman
and
set
it
up
among
the
corn
suddenly
a
group
of
horsemen
from
a
neighbouring
village
gallops
up
and
carries
off
the
straw
puppet
amid
the
screams
and
cries
of
the
women
however
the
ravished
effigy
is
rescued
by
another
band
of
mounted
men
and
after
a
struggle
it
remains
more
or
less
dishevelled
in
the
hands
of
the
women
that
this
pretended
abduction
is
a
mimic
marriage
appears
from
a
berber
custom
in
accordance
with
which
at
a
real
wedding
the
bridegroom
carries
off
his
seemingly
unwilling
bride
on
horseback
while
she
screams
and
pretends
to
summon
her
friends
to
her
rescue
no
fixed
date
is
appointed
for
the
simulated
abduction
of
the
straw
woman
from
the
the
time
depends
upon
the
state
of
the
crops
but
the
day
and
hour
are
made
public
before
the
event
each
village
used
to
practise
this
mimic
contest
for
possession
of
the
straw
woman
who
probably
represents
the
barley
bride
but
nowadays
the
custom
is
growing
obsolete
an
earlier
account
of
what
seems
to
be
the
same
practice
runs
as
follows
there
is
a
curious
custom
which
seems
to
be
a
relic
of
their
pagan
masters
who
made
this
and
the
adjoining
regions
of
north
africa
the
main
granary
of
their
latin
empire
when
the
young
corn
has
sprung
up
which
it
does
about
the
middle
of
february
the
women
of
the
villages
make
up
the
figure
of
a
female
the
size
of
a
very
large
doll
which
they
dress
in
the
gaudiest
fashion
they
can
contrive
covering
it
with
ornaments
to
which
all
in
the
village
contribute
something
and
they
give
it
a
tall
peaked
this
image
they
carry
in
procession
round
their
fields
screaming
and
singing
a
peculiar
ditty
the
doll
is
borne
by
the
foremost
woman
who
must
yield
it
to
any
one
who
is
quick
enough
to
take
the
lead
of
her
which
is
the
cause
of
much
racing
and
squabbling
the
men
also
have
a
similar
custom
which
they
perform
on
horseback
they
call
the
image
mata
these
ceremonies
are
said
by
the
people
to
bring
good
luck
their
efficacy
ought
to
be
great
for
you
frequently
see
crowds
of
men
engaged
in
their
performances
running
and
galloping
recklessly
over
the
young
crops
of
wheat
and
barley
such
customs
are
directly
opposed
to
the
faith
of
islam
and
i
never
met
with
a
moor
who
could
in
any
way
enlighten
me
as
to
their
origin
the
berber
tribes
the
most
ancient
race
now
remaining
in
these
regions
to
which
they
give
the
name
are
the
only
ones
which
retain
this
antique
usage
and
it
is
viewed
by
the
arabs
and
dwellers
in
the
town
as
a
remnant
of
we
may
conjecture
that
this
gaudily
dressed
effigy
of
a
female
which
the
berber
women
carry
about
their
fields
when
the
corn
is
sprouting
represents
the
and
that
the
procession
is
designed
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
by
imparting
to
them
the
quickening
influence
of
the
goddess
we
can
therefore
understand
why
there
should
be
a
competition
among
the
women
for
the
possession
of
the
effigy
each
woman
probably
hopes
to
secure
for
herself
and
her
crops
a
larger
measure
of
fertility
by
appropriating
the
image
of
the
the
competition
on
horseback
among
the
men
is
no
doubt
to
be
explained
similarly
they
too
race
with
each
other
in
their
eagerness
to
possess
themselves
of
an
effigy
perhaps
of
a
male
power
of
the
corn
by
whose
help
they
expect
to
procure
a
heavy
crop
such
contests
for
possession
of
the
embodied
in
the
are
common
as
we
have
seen
among
the
reapers
on
the
harvest
fields
of
europe
perhaps
they
help
to
explain
some
of
the
contests
in
the
eleusinian
games
among
which
as
well
as
were
included
the
in
the
east
indies
if
the
reader
still
feels
any
doubts
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
harvest
customs
which
have
been
practised
within
living
memory
by
european
peasants
these
doubts
may
perhaps
be
dispelled
by
comparing
the
customs
observed
at
the
by
the
malays
and
dyaks
of
the
east
indies
for
these
eastern
peoples
have
not
like
our
peasantry
advanced
beyond
the
intellectual
stage
at
which
the
customs
originated
their
theory
and
their
practice
are
still
in
unison
for
them
the
quaint
rites
which
in
europe
have
long
dwindled
into
mere
fossils
the
pastime
of
clowns
and
the
puzzle
of
the
learned
are
still
living
realities
of
which
they
can
render
an
intelligible
and
truthful
account
hence
a
study
of
their
beliefs
and
usages
concerning
the
rice
may
throw
some
light
on
the
true
meaning
of
the
ritual
of
the
corn
in
ancient
greece
and
modern
europe
now
the
whole
of
the
ritual
which
the
malays
and
dyaks
observe
in
connexion
with
the
rice
is
founded
on
the
simple
conception
of
the
rice
as
animated
by
a
soul
like
that
which
these
people
attribute
to
mankind
they
explain
the
phenomena
of
reproduction
growth
decay
and
death
in
the
rice
on
the
same
principles
on
which
they
explain
the
corresponding
phenomena
in
human
beings
they
imagine
that
in
the
fibres
of
the
plant
as
in
the
body
of
a
man
there
is
a
certain
vital
element
which
is
so
far
independent
of
the
plant
that
it
may
for
a
time
be
completely
separated
from
it
without
fatal
effects
though
if
its
absence
be
prolonged
beyond
certain
limits
the
plant
will
wither
and
die
this
vital
yet
separable
element
is
what
for
the
want
of
a
better
word
we
must
call
the
soul
of
a
plant
just
as
a
similar
vital
and
separable
element
is
commonly
supposed
to
constitute
the
soul
of
man
and
on
this
theory
or
myth
of
the
is
built
the
whole
worship
of
the
cereals
just
as
on
the
theory
or
myth
of
the
human
soul
is
built
the
whole
worship
of
the
dead
towering
superstructure
reared
on
a
slender
and
precarious
foundation
the
strict
parallelism
between
the
indonesian
ideas
about
the
soul
of
man
and
the
soul
of
rice
is
well
brought
out
by
wilkinson
in
the
following
passage
the
spirit
of
life
according
to
the
ancient
indonesian
belief
existed
in
all
things
even
in
what
we
should
now
consider
inanimate
known
as
the
it
was
not
a
soul
in
the
modern
english
sense
since
it
was
not
the
exclusive
possession
of
mankind
its
separation
from
the
body
did
not
necessarily
mean
death
and
its
nature
may
possibly
not
have
been
considered
immortal
at
the
present
day
if
a
malay
feels
faint
he
will
describe
his
condition
by
saying
that
his
spirit
of
life
is
weak
or
is
flying
from
his
body
he
sometimes
appeals
to
it
to
return
hither
hither
bird
of
my
or
again
if
a
malay
lover
wishes
to
influence
the
mind
of
a
girl
he
may
seek
to
obtain
control
of
her
for
he
believes
that
this
spirit
of
active
and
vigorous
life
must
quit
the
body
when
the
body
sleeps
and
so
be
liable
to
capture
by
the
use
of
magic
arts
it
is
however
in
the
ceremonies
connected
with
the
spirit
of
the
that
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
come
out
most
clearly
the
malay
considers
it
essential
that
the
spirit
of
life
should
not
depart
from
the
rice
intended
for
next
year
s
sowing
as
otherwise
the
dead
seed
would
fail
to
produce
any
crop
whatever
he
therefore
approaches
the
standing
at
in
a
deprecatory
manner
he
addresses
them
in
endearing
terms
he
offers
propitiatory
sacrifices
he
fears
that
he
may
scare
away
the
timorous
bird
of
life
by
the
sight
of
a
weapon
or
the
least
sign
of
violence
he
must
reap
the
but
he
does
it
with
a
knife
of
peculiar
shape
such
that
the
cruel
blade
is
hidden
away
beneath
the
reaper
s
fingers
and
does
not
alarm
the
soul
of
the
when
once
the
has
been
harvested
more
expeditious
may
be
employed
since
it
is
clearly
unnecessary
to
retain
the
spirit
of
life
in
grain
that
is
only
intended
for
the
similar
rites
attend
all
the
processes
of
sowing
and
the
as
well
as
the
harvest
at
each
of
these
stages
there
is
a
risk
that
the
vitality
of
the
crop
may
be
ruined
if
the
bird
of
life
is
scared
away
in
the
language
used
by
the
of
these
very
ancient
ceremonies
we
constantly
find
references
to
sri
the
hindu
goddess
of
the
crops
to
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
to
adam
who
according
to
moslem
tradition
was
the
first
planter
of
cereals
of
these
references
only
represent
the
attempts
of
the
conservative
malays
to
make
their
old
religions
harmonize
with
later
beliefs
beneath
successive
layers
of
religious
veneer
we
see
the
animism
of
the
old
indonesians
the
theory
of
a
of
life
and
the
characteristic
view
that
the
best
protection
against
evil
lies
in
gentleness
and
courtesy
to
all
animate
and
inanimate
it
is
a
familiar
fact
says
another
eminent
authority
on
the
east
indies
that
the
indonesian
imagines
rice
to
be
animated
to
be
provided
with
since
rice
is
everywhere
cultivated
in
the
indian
archipelago
and
with
some
exceptions
is
the
staple
food
we
need
not
wonder
that
the
indonesian
conceives
the
rice
to
be
not
merely
animated
in
the
ordinary
sense
but
to
be
possessed
of
a
which
in
strength
and
dignity
ranks
with
that
of
man
thus
the
bataks
apply
the
same
word
to
the
of
rice
and
the
of
human
beings
whereas
the
dyaks
of
poelopetak
give
the
name
of
to
the
of
things
animals
and
plants
they
give
the
name
of
to
the
of
rice
as
well
as
of
man
so
also
the
inhabitants
of
halmahera
call
the
of
things
and
plants
and
but
in
men
and
food
they
recognise
a
of
the
javanese
malays
macassars
buginese
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
of
buru
we
know
that
they
ascribe
a
or
to
rice
as
well
as
to
men
so
it
is
with
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
while
they
manifestly
conceive
all
things
and
plants
as
animated
they
attribute
a
or
only
to
men
animals
and
rice
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
this
custom
originates
in
the
very
high
value
that
is
set
on
believing
the
rice
to
be
animated
by
a
soul
like
that
of
a
man
the
indonesians
naturally
treat
it
with
the
deference
and
the
consideration
which
they
shew
to
their
fellows
thus
they
behave
towards
the
rice
in
bloom
as
they
behave
towards
a
pregnant
woman
they
abstain
from
firing
guns
or
making
loud
noises
in
the
field
lest
they
should
so
frighten
the
soul
of
the
rice
that
it
would
miscarry
and
bear
no
grain
and
for
the
same
reason
they
will
not
talk
of
corpses
or
demons
in
the
moreover
they
feed
the
blooming
rice
with
foods
of
various
kinds
which
are
believed
to
be
wholesome
for
women
with
child
but
when
the
are
just
beginning
to
form
they
are
looked
upon
as
infants
and
women
go
through
the
fields
feeding
them
with
as
if
they
were
human
babes
in
such
natural
and
obvious
comparisons
of
the
breeding
plant
to
a
breeding
woman
and
of
the
young
grain
to
a
young
child
is
to
be
sought
the
origin
of
the
kindred
greek
conception
of
the
and
the
demeter
and
persephone
and
we
need
not
go
further
afield
to
search
for
it
in
a
primitive
division
of
labour
between
the
sexes
but
if
the
timorous
feminine
soul
of
the
rice
can
be
frightened
into
a
miscarriage
even
by
loud
noises
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
her
feelings
must
be
at
harvest
when
people
are
under
the
sad
necessity
of
cutting
down
the
rice
with
the
knife
at
so
critical
a
season
every
precaution
must
be
used
to
render
the
necessary
surgical
operation
of
reaping
as
inconspicuous
and
as
painless
as
possible
for
that
reason
as
we
have
seen
the
reaping
of
the
is
done
with
knives
of
a
peculiar
pattern
such
that
the
blades
are
hidden
in
the
reapers
hands
and
do
not
frighten
the
till
the
very
last
moment
when
her
head
is
swept
off
almost
before
she
is
aware
and
from
a
like
delicate
motive
the
reapers
at
work
in
the
fields
employ
a
special
form
of
speech
which
the
can
not
be
expected
to
understand
so
that
she
has
no
warning
or
inkling
of
what
is
going
forward
till
the
heads
of
rice
are
safely
deposited
in
the
basket
among
the
indonesian
peoples
who
thus
personify
the
rice
we
may
take
the
kayans
or
bahaus
of
central
borneo
as
typical
as
we
have
already
seen
they
are
essentially
an
agricultural
people
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
rice
which
furnishes
their
staple
food
their
religion
is
deeply
coloured
by
this
main
occupation
of
their
lives
and
it
presents
many
analogies
to
the
eleusinian
worship
of
the
demeter
and
persephone
and
just
as
the
greeks
regarded
corn
as
a
gift
of
the
goddess
demeter
so
the
kayans
believe
that
rice
maize
sweet
potatoes
tobacco
and
all
the
other
products
of
the
earth
which
they
cultivate
were
originally
created
for
their
benefit
by
the
spirits
in
order
to
secure
and
detain
the
volatile
soul
of
the
rice
the
kayans
resort
to
a
number
of
devices
among
the
instruments
employed
for
this
purpose
are
a
miniature
ladder
a
spatula
and
a
basket
containing
hooks
thorns
and
cords
with
the
spatula
the
priestess
strokes
the
soul
of
the
rice
down
the
little
ladder
into
the
basket
where
it
is
naturally
held
fast
by
the
hooks
the
thorn
and
the
cord
and
having
thus
captured
and
imprisoned
the
soul
she
conveys
it
into
the
sometimes
a
bamboo
box
and
a
net
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
and
in
order
to
ensure
a
good
harvest
for
the
following
year
it
is
necessary
not
only
to
detain
the
soul
of
all
the
grains
of
rice
which
are
safely
stored
in
the
granary
but
also
to
attract
and
recover
the
soul
of
all
the
rice
that
has
been
lost
through
falling
to
the
earth
or
being
eaten
by
deer
apes
and
pigs
for
this
purpose
instruments
of
various
sorts
have
been
invented
by
the
priests
one
for
example
is
a
bamboo
vessel
provided
with
four
hooks
made
from
the
wood
of
a
by
means
of
which
the
absent
may
be
hooked
and
drawn
back
into
the
vessel
which
is
then
hung
up
in
the
house
sometimes
two
hands
carved
out
of
the
wood
of
a
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
and
every
time
that
a
kayan
housewife
fetches
rice
from
the
granary
for
the
use
of
her
household
she
must
propitiate
the
souls
of
the
rice
in
the
granary
lest
they
should
be
angry
at
being
robbed
of
their
substance
to
keep
them
in
good
humour
a
bundle
of
shavings
of
a
and
a
little
basket
are
always
hung
in
the
granary
an
egg
and
a
small
vessel
containing
the
juice
of
are
attached
as
offerings
to
the
bundle
of
shavings
and
the
basket
contains
a
sacred
mat
which
is
used
at
fetching
the
rice
when
the
housewife
comes
to
fetch
rice
from
the
granary
she
pours
juice
of
the
on
the
egg
takes
the
sacred
mat
from
the
basket
spreads
it
on
the
ground
lays
a
stalk
of
rice
on
it
and
explains
to
the
souls
of
the
rice
the
object
of
her
coming
then
she
kneels
before
the
mat
mutters
some
prayers
or
spells
eats
a
single
grain
from
the
and
having
restored
the
various
objects
to
their
proper
place
departs
from
the
granary
with
the
requisite
amount
of
rice
satisfied
that
she
has
discharged
her
religious
duty
to
the
spirits
of
the
rice
at
harvest
the
spirits
of
the
rice
are
propitiated
with
offerings
of
food
and
water
which
are
carried
by
children
to
the
at
evening
the
first
which
have
been
cut
are
solemnly
brought
home
in
a
consecrated
basket
to
the
beating
of
a
gong
and
all
cats
and
dogs
are
driven
from
the
house
before
the
basket
with
its
precious
contents
is
brought
in
among
the
kayans
of
the
mahakam
river
in
central
borneo
the
sowing
of
the
rice
is
immediately
preceded
by
a
performance
of
masked
men
which
is
intended
to
attract
the
soul
or
rather
souls
of
the
rice
and
so
to
make
sure
that
the
harvest
will
be
a
good
one
the
performers
represent
spirits
for
believing
that
spirits
are
mightier
than
men
the
kayans
imagine
that
they
can
acquire
and
exert
superhuman
power
by
imitating
the
form
and
actions
of
spirits
to
support
their
assumed
character
they
wear
grotesque
masks
with
goggle
eyes
great
teeth
huge
ears
and
beards
of
white
goat
s
hair
while
their
bodies
are
so
thickly
wrapt
up
in
shredded
that
to
the
spectator
they
present
the
appearance
of
unwieldy
masses
of
green
foliage
the
leader
of
the
band
carries
a
long
wooden
hook
or
rather
crook
the
shaft
of
which
is
partly
whittled
into
loose
fluttering
shavings
these
disguises
they
don
at
a
little
distance
from
the
village
then
dropping
down
the
river
in
boats
they
land
and
march
in
procession
to
an
open
space
among
the
houses
where
the
people
dressed
out
in
all
their
finery
are
waiting
to
witness
the
performance
here
the
maskers
range
themselves
in
a
circle
and
dance
for
some
time
under
the
burning
rays
of
the
midday
sun
waving
their
arms
shaking
and
turning
their
heads
and
executing
a
variety
of
steps
to
the
sound
of
a
gong
which
is
beaten
according
to
a
rigidly
prescribed
rhythm
after
the
dance
they
form
a
line
one
behind
the
other
to
fetch
the
vagrant
soul
of
the
rice
from
far
countries
at
the
head
of
the
procession
marches
the
leader
holding
high
his
crook
and
behind
him
follow
all
the
other
masked
men
in
their
leafy
costume
each
holding
his
fellow
by
the
hand
as
he
strides
along
the
leader
makes
a
motion
with
his
crook
as
if
he
were
hooking
something
and
drawing
it
to
himself
and
the
gesture
is
imitated
by
all
his
followers
what
he
is
thus
catching
are
the
souls
of
the
rice
which
sometimes
wander
far
away
and
by
drawing
them
home
to
the
village
he
is
believed
to
ensure
that
the
seed
of
the
rice
which
is
about
to
be
sown
will
produce
a
plentiful
harvest
as
the
spirits
are
thought
not
to
possess
the
power
of
speech
the
actors
who
personate
them
may
not
utter
a
word
else
they
would
run
the
risk
of
falling
down
dead
the
great
field
of
the
chief
is
sown
by
representatives
of
all
the
families
both
free
and
slaves
on
the
day
after
the
masquerade
on
the
same
day
the
free
families
sacrifice
on
their
fields
and
begin
their
sowing
on
one
or
other
of
the
following
days
every
family
sets
up
in
its
field
a
sacrificial
stage
or
altar
with
which
the
sowers
must
remain
in
connexion
during
the
time
of
sowing
therefore
no
stranger
may
pass
between
them
and
the
stage
indeed
the
kayans
are
not
allowed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
strangers
in
the
fields
above
all
they
may
not
speak
with
them
if
such
a
thing
should
accidentally
happen
the
sowing
must
cease
for
that
day
at
the
sowing
festival
but
at
no
other
time
kayan
men
of
the
mahakam
river
like
their
brethren
of
the
mendalam
river
amuse
themselves
with
spinning
tops
for
nine
days
before
the
masquerade
takes
place
the
people
are
bound
to
observe
certain
taboos
no
stranger
may
enter
the
village
no
villager
may
pass
the
night
out
of
his
own
house
they
may
not
hunt
nor
pluck
fruits
nor
fish
with
the
or
the
in
this
tribe
the
proper
day
for
sowing
is
officially
determined
by
a
priest
from
an
observation
of
the
sun
setting
behind
the
hills
in
a
line
with
two
stones
which
the
priest
has
set
up
one
behind
the
other
however
the
official
day
often
does
not
coincide
with
the
actual
day
of
sowing
the
masquerade
thus
performed
by
the
kayans
of
the
mahakam
river
before
sowing
the
rice
is
an
instructive
example
of
a
religious
or
rather
magical
drama
acted
for
the
express
purpose
of
ensuring
a
good
crop
as
such
it
may
be
compared
to
the
drama
of
demeter
and
persephone
the
and
the
which
was
annually
played
at
the
eleusinian
mysteries
shortly
before
the
autumnal
sowing
of
the
corn
if
my
interpretation
of
these
mysteries
is
correct
the
intention
of
the
greek
and
of
the
kayan
drama
was
one
and
the
same
at
harvest
the
dyaks
of
northern
borneo
have
a
special
feast
the
object
of
which
is
to
secure
the
soul
of
the
rice
which
if
not
so
detained
the
produce
of
their
farms
would
speedily
rot
and
decay
at
sowing
time
a
little
of
the
principle
of
life
of
the
rice
which
at
every
harvest
is
secured
by
their
priests
is
planted
with
their
other
seeds
and
is
thus
propagated
and
the
mode
of
securing
the
soul
of
the
rice
varies
in
different
tribes
in
the
quop
district
the
ceremony
is
performed
by
the
chief
priest
alone
first
in
the
long
broad
verandah
of
the
common
house
and
afterwards
in
each
separate
family
apartment
as
a
preparation
for
the
ceremony
a
bamboo
altar
decorated
with
green
boughs
and
red
and
white
streamers
is
erected
in
the
verandah
and
presents
a
very
gay
appearance
here
the
people
old
and
young
assemble
the
priestesses
dressed
in
gorgeous
array
and
the
elder
men
wearing
jackets
and
trousers
of
purple
yellow
or
scarlet
hue
while
the
young
men
and
lads
beat
gongs
and
drums
when
the
priest
with
a
bundle
of
charms
in
either
hand
is
observed
to
be
gazing
earnestly
in
the
air
at
something
invisible
to
common
eyes
the
band
strikes
up
with
redoubled
energy
and
the
elderly
men
in
the
gay
breeches
begin
to
shriek
and
revolve
round
the
altar
in
the
dance
suddenly
the
priest
starts
up
and
makes
a
rush
at
the
invisible
object
men
run
to
him
with
white
cloths
and
as
he
shakes
his
charms
over
the
cloths
a
few
grains
of
rice
fall
into
them
these
grains
are
the
soul
of
the
rice
they
are
carefully
folded
up
in
the
cloths
and
laid
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
the
same
performance
is
afterwards
repeated
in
every
family
apartment
in
some
tribes
the
soul
of
the
rice
is
secured
at
midnight
outside
the
village
a
lofty
altar
is
erected
in
an
open
space
surrounded
by
the
stately
forms
of
the
tropical
palms
huge
bonfires
cast
a
ruddy
glow
over
the
scene
and
light
up
the
dusky
but
picturesque
forms
of
the
dyaks
as
they
move
in
slow
and
solemn
dance
round
the
altar
some
bearing
lighted
tapers
in
their
hands
others
brass
salvers
with
offerings
of
rice
others
covered
baskets
of
which
the
contents
are
hidden
from
all
but
the
initiated
the
of
the
altar
are
lofty
bamboos
whose
leafy
tops
are
yet
green
and
rustle
in
the
wind
and
from
one
of
them
a
long
narrow
streamer
of
white
cloth
hangs
down
suddenly
elders
and
priests
rush
at
this
streamer
seize
the
end
of
it
and
amid
the
crashing
music
of
drums
and
gongs
and
the
yells
of
the
spectators
begin
dancing
and
swaying
themselves
backwards
and
forwards
and
to
and
fro
a
priest
or
elder
mounts
the
altar
amid
the
shouts
of
the
bystanders
and
shakes
the
tall
bamboos
violently
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
excitement
and
hubbub
small
stones
bunches
of
hair
and
grains
of
rice
fall
at
the
feet
of
the
dancers
and
are
carefully
picked
up
by
watchful
attendants
these
grains
are
the
soul
of
the
rice
the
ceremony
ends
with
several
of
the
oldest
priestesses
falling
or
pretending
to
fall
senseless
to
the
ground
where
till
they
come
to
themselves
their
heads
are
supported
and
their
faces
fanned
by
their
younger
colleagues
at
the
end
of
the
harvest
when
the
year
s
crop
has
been
garnered
another
feast
is
held
a
pig
and
fowls
are
killed
and
for
four
days
gongs
are
beaten
and
dancing
kept
up
for
eight
days
the
village
is
tabooed
and
no
stranger
may
enter
it
at
this
festival
the
ceremony
of
catching
the
soul
of
the
rice
is
repeated
to
prevent
the
crop
from
rotting
and
the
soul
so
obtained
is
mixed
with
the
of
the
next
year
the
same
need
of
securing
the
soul
of
the
rice
if
the
crop
is
to
thrive
is
keenly
felt
by
the
karens
of
burma
when
a
does
not
flourish
they
suppose
that
the
soul
of
the
rice
is
in
some
way
detained
from
the
rice
if
the
soul
can
not
be
called
back
the
crop
will
fail
the
following
formula
is
used
in
recalling
the
soul
of
the
rice
o
come
come
come
to
the
field
come
to
the
rice
with
seed
of
each
gender
come
come
from
the
river
kho
come
from
the
river
kaw
from
the
place
where
they
meet
come
come
from
the
west
come
from
the
east
from
the
throat
of
the
bird
from
the
maw
of
the
ape
from
the
throat
of
the
elephant
come
from
the
sources
of
rivers
and
their
mouths
come
from
the
country
of
the
shan
and
burman
from
the
distant
kingdoms
come
from
all
granaries
come
o
come
to
the
among
the
taungthu
of
upper
burma
it
is
customary
when
all
the
have
been
reaped
to
make
a
trail
of
unhusked
rice
paddy
and
husks
all
the
way
from
the
fields
to
the
in
order
to
guide
the
spirit
or
butterfly
as
they
call
it
of
the
rice
home
to
the
granary
care
is
taken
that
there
should
be
no
break
in
the
trail
and
the
butterfly
of
the
rice
is
invited
with
loud
cries
to
come
to
the
house
were
the
spirit
of
the
rice
not
secured
in
this
manner
next
year
s
harvest
would
be
bad
similarly
among
the
cherokee
indians
of
north
america
care
was
always
taken
to
keep
a
clean
trail
from
the
field
to
the
house
so
that
the
corn
might
be
encouraged
to
stay
at
home
and
not
go
wandering
elsewhere
and
seven
ears
from
the
last
year
s
crop
were
always
put
carefully
aside
in
order
to
the
until
the
new
crop
was
in
hsa
möng
hkam
a
native
state
of
upper
burma
when
two
men
work
in
partnership
they
take
particular
care
as
to
the
division
of
the
grain
between
them
each
partner
has
a
basket
made
of
which
both
top
and
bottom
are
carefully
closed
with
wood
to
prevent
the
butterfly
spirit
of
the
rice
from
escaping
for
if
it
were
to
flutter
away
the
next
year
s
crop
would
be
but
poor
among
the
talaings
of
lower
burma
the
last
sheaf
is
larger
than
the
rest
it
is
brought
home
separately
usually
if
not
invariably
on
the
morning
after
the
remainder
of
the
harvest
has
been
carted
to
the
the
cultivators
drive
out
in
their
taking
with
them
a
woman
s
comb
a
and
a
woman
s
skirt
the
sheaf
is
dressed
in
the
skirt
and
apparently
the
form
is
gone
through
of
presenting
it
with
the
glass
and
comb
it
is
then
brought
home
in
triumph
the
people
decking
the
cart
with
their
silk
kerchiefs
and
cheering
and
singing
the
whole
way
on
their
arrival
home
they
celebrate
the
occasion
with
a
feast
strictly
speaking
the
sheaf
should
be
kept
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
harvest
owing
however
to
the
high
price
of
paddy
it
often
finds
its
way
to
the
even
when
this
is
not
the
case
it
is
rarely
tended
so
carefully
as
it
is
said
to
have
been
in
former
days
and
if
not
threshed
with
the
remaining
crop
is
apt
to
be
eaten
by
the
cattle
so
far
as
i
could
ascertain
it
had
never
been
the
custom
to
keep
it
throughout
the
year
but
on
the
first
ploughing
of
the
ensuing
season
there
was
some
ceremony
in
connection
with
it
the
name
of
the
sheaf
was
at
first
i
was
inclined
to
fancy
that
this
was
a
contraction
of
ma
the
old
woman
of
the
there
are
however
various
reasons
for
discarding
this
derivation
and
i
am
unable
to
suggest
any
in
this
custom
the
personification
of
the
last
sheaf
of
rice
as
a
woman
comes
out
clearly
in
the
practice
of
dressing
it
up
in
female
attire
the
of
our
european
peasants
has
her
match
in
the
of
the
minangkabauers
of
sumatra
the
minangkabauers
definitely
attribute
a
soul
to
rice
and
will
sometimes
assert
that
rice
pounded
in
the
usual
way
tastes
better
than
rice
ground
in
a
mill
because
in
the
mill
the
body
of
the
rice
was
so
bruised
and
battered
that
the
soul
has
fled
from
it
like
the
javanese
they
think
that
the
rice
is
under
the
special
guardianship
of
a
female
spirit
called
saning
sari
who
is
conceived
as
so
closely
knit
up
with
the
plant
that
the
rice
often
goes
by
her
name
as
with
the
romans
the
corn
might
be
called
ceres
in
particular
saning
sari
is
represented
by
certain
stalks
or
grains
called
that
is
literally
mother
of
rice
a
name
that
is
often
given
to
the
guardian
spirit
herself
this
mother
of
rice
is
the
occasion
of
a
number
of
ceremonies
observed
at
the
planting
and
harvesting
of
the
rice
as
well
as
during
its
preservation
in
the
barn
when
the
seed
of
the
rice
is
about
to
be
sown
in
the
nursery
or
ground
where
under
the
wet
system
of
cultivation
it
is
regularly
allowed
to
sprout
before
being
transplanted
to
the
fields
the
best
grains
are
picked
out
to
form
the
these
are
then
sown
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
and
the
common
seed
is
planted
round
about
them
the
state
of
the
is
supposed
to
exert
the
greatest
influence
on
the
growth
of
the
rice
if
she
droops
or
pines
away
the
harvest
will
be
bad
in
consequence
the
woman
who
sows
the
in
the
nursery
lets
her
hair
hang
loose
and
afterwards
bathes
as
a
means
of
ensuring
an
abundant
harvest
when
the
time
comes
to
transplant
the
rice
from
the
nursery
to
the
field
the
receives
a
special
place
either
in
the
middle
or
in
a
corner
of
the
field
and
a
prayer
or
charm
is
uttered
as
follows
saning
sari
may
a
measure
of
rice
come
from
a
stalk
of
rice
and
a
basketful
from
a
root
may
you
be
frightened
neither
by
lightning
nor
by
sunshine
make
you
glad
with
the
storm
may
you
be
at
peace
and
may
rain
serve
to
wash
your
face
while
the
rice
is
growing
the
particular
plant
which
was
thus
treated
as
the
is
lost
sight
of
but
before
harvest
another
is
found
when
the
crop
is
ripe
for
cutting
the
oldest
woman
of
the
family
or
a
sorcerer
goes
out
to
look
for
her
the
first
stalks
seen
to
bend
under
a
passing
breeze
are
the
and
they
are
tied
together
but
not
cut
until
the
of
the
field
have
been
carried
home
to
serve
as
a
festal
meal
for
the
family
and
their
friends
nay
even
for
the
domestic
animals
since
it
is
saning
sari
s
pleasure
that
the
beasts
also
should
partake
of
her
good
gifts
after
the
meal
has
been
eaten
the
is
fetched
home
by
persons
in
gay
attire
who
carry
her
very
carefully
under
an
umbrella
in
a
neatly
worked
bag
to
the
barn
where
a
place
in
the
middle
is
assigned
to
her
every
one
believes
that
she
takes
care
of
the
rice
in
the
barn
and
even
multiplies
it
not
uncommonly
when
the
tomori
of
central
celebes
are
about
to
plant
the
rice
they
bury
in
the
field
some
betel
as
an
offering
to
the
spirits
who
cause
the
rice
to
grow
over
the
spot
where
the
offering
is
buried
a
small
floor
of
wood
is
laid
and
the
family
sits
on
it
and
consumes
betel
together
as
a
sort
of
silent
prayer
or
charm
to
ensure
the
growth
of
the
crop
the
rice
that
is
planted
round
this
spot
is
the
last
to
be
reaped
at
harvest
at
the
commencement
of
the
reaping
the
stalks
of
this
patch
of
rice
are
tied
together
into
a
sheaf
which
is
called
the
mother
of
the
rice
and
offerings
in
the
shape
of
rice
fowl
s
liver
eggs
and
other
things
are
laid
down
before
it
when
all
the
rest
of
the
rice
in
the
field
has
been
reaped
the
mother
of
the
rice
is
cut
down
and
carried
with
due
honour
to
the
where
it
is
laid
on
the
floor
and
all
the
other
sheaves
are
piled
upon
it
the
tomori
we
are
told
regard
the
mother
of
the
rice
as
a
special
offering
made
to
the
omonga
who
dwells
in
the
moon
if
that
spirit
is
not
treated
with
proper
respect
for
example
if
the
people
who
fetch
rice
from
the
barn
are
not
decently
clad
he
is
angry
and
punishes
the
offenders
by
eating
up
twice
as
much
rice
in
the
barn
as
they
have
taken
out
of
it
some
people
have
heard
him
smacking
his
lips
in
the
barn
as
he
devoured
the
rice
on
the
other
hand
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
who
also
practise
the
custom
of
the
at
harvest
regard
her
as
the
actual
mother
of
the
whole
harvest
and
therefore
keep
her
carefully
lest
in
her
absence
the
garnered
store
of
rice
should
all
melt
away
and
disappear
among
the
tomori
as
among
other
indonesian
peoples
reapers
at
work
in
the
field
make
use
of
special
words
which
differ
from
the
terms
in
ordinary
use
the
reason
for
adopting
this
peculiar
form
of
speech
at
reaping
appears
to
be
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
a
fear
of
alarming
the
timid
soul
of
the
rice
by
revealing
the
fate
in
store
for
it
to
the
same
motive
is
perhaps
to
be
ascribed
the
practice
observed
by
the
tomori
of
asking
each
other
riddles
at
harvest
similarly
among
the
alfoors
or
toradjas
of
poso
in
central
celebes
while
the
people
are
watching
the
crops
in
the
fields
they
amuse
themselves
with
asking
each
other
riddles
and
telling
stories
and
when
any
one
guesses
a
riddle
aright
the
whole
company
cries
out
let
our
rice
come
up
let
fat
ears
come
up
both
in
the
lowlands
and
on
the
but
all
the
time
between
harvest
and
the
laying
out
of
new
fields
the
asking
of
riddles
and
the
telling
of
stories
is
strictly
forbidden
thus
among
these
people
it
seems
that
the
asking
of
riddles
is
for
some
reason
regarded
as
a
charm
which
may
make
or
mar
the
crops
among
some
of
the
toradjas
of
celebes
the
ceremony
of
cutting
and
bringing
home
the
mother
of
the
rice
is
observed
as
follows
when
the
crop
is
ripe
in
the
fields
the
mother
of
the
rice
must
be
fetched
before
the
rest
of
the
harvest
is
reaped
the
ceremony
is
performed
on
a
lucky
day
by
a
woman
who
knows
the
rites
for
three
days
previously
she
observes
certain
precautions
to
prevent
the
soul
of
the
rice
from
escaping
out
of
the
field
as
it
might
be
apt
to
do
if
it
got
wind
that
the
reapers
with
their
cruel
knives
were
so
soon
to
crop
the
ripe
ears
with
this
view
she
ties
up
a
handful
of
standing
stalks
of
the
rice
into
a
bunch
in
each
corner
of
the
field
while
she
recites
an
invocation
to
the
spirits
of
the
rice
bidding
them
gather
in
the
field
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
heaven
as
a
further
precaution
she
stops
the
sluices
lest
with
the
outrush
of
the
water
from
the
the
sly
soul
of
the
rice
should
make
good
its
escape
and
she
ties
knots
in
the
leaves
of
the
all
to
hinder
the
soul
of
the
rice
from
running
away
this
she
does
in
the
afternoon
of
three
successive
days
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
she
comes
again
to
the
field
sits
down
in
a
corner
of
it
and
kisses
the
rice
three
times
again
inviting
the
souls
of
the
rice
to
come
thither
and
assuring
them
of
her
affection
and
care
then
she
cuts
the
bunch
of
which
she
had
tied
together
on
one
of
the
previous
days
the
stalks
in
the
bunch
must
be
nine
in
number
and
their
leaves
must
be
cut
with
them
not
thrown
away
as
she
cuts
she
may
not
look
about
her
nor
cry
out
nor
speak
to
any
one
nor
be
spoken
to
but
she
says
to
the
rice
the
prophet
reaps
you
i
take
you
but
you
diminish
not
i
hold
you
in
my
hand
and
you
increase
you
are
the
links
of
my
soul
the
support
of
my
body
my
blessing
my
salvation
there
is
no
god
but
then
she
passes
to
another
corner
of
the
field
to
cut
the
bunch
of
standing
rice
in
it
with
the
same
ceremony
but
before
coming
to
it
she
stops
half
way
to
pluck
another
bunch
of
five
stalks
in
like
manner
thus
from
the
four
sides
of
the
field
she
collects
in
all
stalks
of
rice
which
together
make
up
the
mother
of
the
rice
then
in
a
corner
of
the
field
she
makes
a
little
stage
and
lays
the
mother
of
the
rice
on
it
with
the
ears
turned
towards
the
standing
rice
and
the
cut
stalks
towards
the
dyke
which
encloses
the
field
after
that
she
binds
the
stalks
of
the
into
a
sheaf
with
the
bark
of
a
particular
kind
of
tree
as
she
does
so
she
says
the
prophet
binds
you
into
a
sheaf
the
angel
increases
you
the
cares
for
you
we
loved
and
cared
for
each
then
after
anointing
the
sheaf
and
fumigating
it
with
incense
she
lays
it
on
the
little
stage
on
this
stage
she
had
previously
placed
several
kinds
of
rice
betel
one
or
more
eggs
sweetmeats
and
young
all
as
offerings
to
the
mother
of
the
rice
who
if
she
did
not
receive
these
attentions
would
be
offended
and
visit
people
with
sickness
or
even
vanish
away
altogether
sometimes
on
large
farms
a
fowl
is
killed
and
its
blood
deposited
in
the
half
of
a
on
the
stage
the
standing
rice
round
about
the
stage
is
the
last
of
the
whole
field
to
be
reaped
when
it
has
been
cut
it
is
bound
up
with
the
mother
of
the
rice
into
a
single
sheaf
and
carried
home
any
body
may
carry
the
sheaf
but
in
doing
so
he
or
she
must
take
care
not
to
let
it
fall
or
the
would
be
angry
and
might
disappear
among
the
battas
or
bataks
of
sumatra
the
rice
appears
to
be
personified
as
a
young
unmarried
woman
rather
than
as
a
mother
on
the
first
day
of
reaping
the
crop
only
a
few
ears
of
rice
are
plucked
and
made
up
into
a
little
sheaf
after
that
the
reaping
may
begin
and
while
it
is
going
forward
offerings
of
rice
and
betel
are
presented
in
the
middle
of
the
field
to
the
spirit
of
the
rice
who
is
personified
under
the
name
of
miss
dajang
the
offering
is
accompanied
by
a
common
meal
shared
by
the
reapers
when
all
the
rice
has
been
reaped
threshed
and
garnered
the
little
sheaf
which
was
first
cut
is
brought
in
and
laid
on
the
top
of
the
heap
in
the
granary
together
with
an
egg
or
a
stone
which
is
supposed
to
watch
over
the
rice
though
we
are
not
told
we
may
assume
that
the
personified
spirit
of
the
rice
is
supposed
to
be
present
in
the
first
sheaf
cut
and
in
that
form
to
keep
guard
over
the
rice
in
the
granary
another
writer
who
has
independently
described
the
customs
of
the
at
the
tells
us
that
the
largest
sheaf
which
is
usually
the
one
first
made
up
is
regarded
as
the
seat
of
the
and
is
treated
exactly
like
a
person
at
the
trampling
of
the
paddy
to
separate
the
grain
from
the
husks
the
sheaf
in
question
is
specially
entrusted
to
a
girl
who
has
a
lucky
name
and
whose
parents
are
both
alive
in
mandeling
a
district
of
sumatra
contrary
to
what
seems
to
be
the
usual
practice
the
spirit
of
the
rice
is
personified
as
a
male
instead
of
as
a
female
and
is
called
the
rajah
or
king
of
the
rice
he
is
supposed
to
be
immanent
in
certain
which
are
recognised
by
their
peculiar
formation
such
as
a
concealment
of
the
ears
in
the
sheath
an
unusual
arrangement
of
the
leaves
or
a
stunted
growth
when
one
or
more
such
plants
have
been
discovered
in
the
field
they
are
sprinkled
with
and
the
spirits
are
invoked
by
name
and
informed
that
they
are
expected
at
home
and
that
all
is
ready
for
their
reception
then
the
king
of
the
rice
is
plucked
with
the
hand
and
seven
neighbouring
cut
with
a
knife
he
and
his
seven
companions
are
then
carefully
brought
home
the
bearer
may
not
speak
a
word
and
the
children
in
the
house
may
make
no
noise
till
the
king
of
the
rice
has
been
safely
lodged
in
the
granary
and
tethered
for
greater
security
with
a
grass
rope
to
one
of
the
posts
as
soon
as
that
is
done
the
doors
are
shut
to
prevent
the
spirits
of
the
rice
from
escaping
the
person
who
fetches
the
king
of
the
rice
from
the
field
should
prepare
himself
for
the
important
duty
by
eating
a
hearty
meal
for
it
would
be
an
omen
of
a
bad
harvest
if
he
presented
himself
before
the
king
of
the
rice
with
an
empty
stomach
for
the
same
reason
the
sower
of
rice
should
sow
the
seed
on
a
full
stomach
in
order
that
the
ears
which
spring
from
the
seed
may
be
full
also
again
just
as
in
scotland
the
old
and
the
young
spirit
of
the
corn
are
represented
as
an
old
wife
and
a
maiden
respectively
so
in
the
malay
peninsula
we
find
both
the
and
her
child
represented
by
different
sheaves
or
bundles
of
ears
on
the
the
following
directions
for
obtaining
both
are
translated
from
a
native
malay
work
on
the
cultivation
of
rice
when
the
rice
is
ripe
all
over
one
must
first
take
the
soul
out
of
all
the
plots
of
one
s
field
you
choose
the
spot
where
the
rice
is
best
and
where
it
is
female
that
is
to
say
where
the
bunch
of
stalks
is
big
and
where
there
are
seven
joints
in
the
stalk
you
begin
with
a
bunch
of
this
kind
and
clip
seven
stems
to
be
the
soul
of
the
rice
and
then
you
clip
yet
another
handful
to
be
the
for
the
following
year
the
soul
is
wrapped
in
a
white
cloth
tied
with
a
cord
of
bark
and
made
into
the
shape
of
a
little
child
in
swaddling
clothes
and
put
into
the
small
basket
the
is
put
into
another
basket
and
both
are
fumigated
with
benzoin
and
then
the
two
baskets
are
piled
the
one
on
the
other
and
taken
home
and
put
into
the
the
receptacle
in
which
rice
is
stored
the
ceremony
of
cutting
and
bringing
home
the
soul
of
the
rice
was
witnessed
by
skeat
at
chodoi
in
selangor
on
the
of
january
the
particular
bunch
or
sheaf
which
was
to
serve
as
the
mother
of
the
had
previously
been
sought
and
identified
by
means
of
the
markings
or
shape
of
the
ears
from
this
sheaf
an
aged
sorceress
with
much
solemnity
cut
a
little
bundle
of
seven
ears
anointed
them
with
oil
tied
them
round
with
thread
fumigated
them
with
incense
and
having
wrapt
them
in
a
white
cloth
deposited
them
in
a
little
basket
these
seven
ears
were
the
infant
soul
of
the
rice
and
the
little
basket
was
its
cradle
it
was
carried
home
to
the
farmer
s
house
by
another
woman
who
held
up
an
umbrella
to
screen
the
tender
infant
from
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
arrived
at
the
house
the
was
welcomed
by
the
women
of
the
family
and
laid
cradle
and
all
on
a
new
with
pillows
at
the
head
after
that
the
farmer
s
wife
was
instructed
to
observe
certain
rules
of
taboo
for
three
days
the
rules
being
in
many
respects
identical
with
those
which
have
to
be
observed
for
three
days
after
the
birth
of
a
real
child
for
example
perfect
quiet
must
be
observed
as
in
a
house
where
a
baby
has
just
been
born
a
light
was
placed
near
the
head
of
the
s
bed
and
might
not
go
out
at
night
while
the
fire
on
the
hearth
had
to
be
kept
up
both
day
and
night
till
the
three
days
were
over
hair
might
not
be
cut
and
money
rice
salt
oil
and
so
forth
were
forbidden
to
go
out
of
the
house
though
of
course
these
valuable
articles
were
quite
free
to
come
in
something
of
the
same
tender
care
which
is
thus
bestowed
on
the
is
naturally
extended
also
to
its
parent
the
sheaf
from
whose
body
it
was
taken
this
sheaf
which
remains
standing
in
the
field
after
the
has
been
carried
home
and
put
to
bed
is
treated
as
a
mother
that
is
to
say
young
shoots
of
trees
are
pounded
together
and
scattered
broadcast
every
evening
for
three
successive
days
and
when
the
three
days
are
up
you
take
the
pulp
of
a
and
what
are
called
mix
them
up
eat
them
with
a
little
sugar
and
spit
some
of
the
mixture
out
among
the
rice
so
after
a
real
birth
the
young
shoots
of
the
the
certain
kinds
of
banana
and
the
thin
pulp
of
young
are
mixed
with
dried
fish
salt
acid
and
the
like
dainties
to
form
a
sort
of
salad
which
is
administered
to
mother
and
child
for
three
successive
days
the
last
sheaf
is
reaped
by
the
farmer
s
wife
who
carries
it
back
to
the
house
where
it
is
threshed
and
mixed
with
the
the
farmer
then
takes
the
and
its
basket
and
deposits
it
together
with
the
product
of
the
last
sheaf
in
the
big
circular
used
by
the
malays
some
grains
from
the
are
mixed
with
the
seed
which
is
to
be
sown
in
the
following
year
in
this
and
of
the
malay
peninsula
we
may
see
the
counterpart
and
in
a
sense
the
prototype
of
the
demeter
and
persephone
of
ancient
greece
once
more
the
european
custom
of
representing
the
in
the
double
form
of
bride
and
bridegroom
has
its
parallel
in
a
ceremony
observed
at
the
in
java
before
the
reapers
begin
to
cut
the
rice
the
priest
or
sorcerer
picks
out
a
number
of
ears
of
rice
which
are
tied
together
smeared
with
ointment
and
adorned
with
flowers
thus
decked
out
the
ears
are
called
the
that
is
the
and
the
their
wedding
feast
is
celebrated
and
the
cutting
of
the
rice
begins
immediately
afterwards
later
on
when
the
rice
is
being
got
in
a
bridal
chamber
is
partitioned
off
in
the
barn
and
furnished
with
a
new
mat
a
lamp
and
all
kinds
of
toilet
articles
sheaves
of
rice
to
represent
the
wedding
guests
are
placed
beside
the
and
the
not
till
this
has
been
done
may
the
whole
harvest
be
housed
in
the
barn
and
for
the
first
forty
days
after
the
rice
has
been
housed
no
one
may
enter
the
barn
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
pair
another
account
of
the
javanese
custom
runs
as
follows
when
the
rice
at
harvest
is
to
be
brought
home
two
handfuls
of
common
unhusked
rice
paddy
are
tied
together
into
a
sheaf
and
two
handfuls
of
a
special
kind
of
rice
are
tied
up
into
another
sheaf
then
the
two
sheaves
are
fastened
together
in
a
bundle
which
goes
by
the
name
of
the
bridal
pair
the
special
rice
is
the
bridegroom
the
common
rice
is
the
bride
at
the
barn
the
bridal
pair
is
received
on
a
by
a
wizard
who
removes
them
from
the
fan
and
lays
them
on
the
floor
with
a
couch
of
leaves
under
them
in
order
that
the
rice
may
increase
and
beside
them
he
places
a
nut
tamarind
pips
and
a
top
and
string
as
playthings
with
which
the
young
couple
may
divert
themselves
the
bride
is
called
emboq
sri
and
the
bridegroom
sadana
and
the
wizard
addresses
them
by
name
saying
emboq
sri
and
sadana
i
have
now
brought
you
home
and
i
have
prepared
a
place
for
you
may
you
sleep
agreeably
in
this
agreeable
place
emboq
sri
and
sadana
you
have
been
received
by
the
owner
let
lead
a
life
free
from
care
may
emboq
sri
s
luck
continue
in
this
very
agreeable
place
the
same
idea
of
the
as
a
husband
and
wife
meets
us
also
in
the
harvest
customs
of
bali
and
lombok
two
islands
which
lie
immediately
to
the
east
of
java
the
inhabitants
of
lombok
we
are
told
think
of
the
as
animated
by
a
soul
they
regard
it
as
one
with
a
divinity
and
treat
it
with
the
distinction
and
honour
that
are
shewn
to
a
very
important
person
but
as
it
is
impossible
to
treat
all
the
in
a
field
ceremoniously
the
native
feeling
the
need
of
a
visible
and
tangible
representative
of
the
and
taking
a
part
for
the
whole
picks
out
some
stalks
and
conceives
them
as
the
visible
abode
of
the
to
which
he
can
pay
his
homage
and
from
which
he
hopes
to
derive
advantage
these
few
stalks
the
foremost
among
their
many
peers
form
what
is
called
the
by
the
people
of
bali
and
the
by
the
sassaks
of
lombok
the
name
is
sometimes
translated
but
the
more
correct
translation
is
said
to
be
the
principal
the
stalks
of
which
this
principal
rice
consists
are
the
first
nine
shoots
which
the
husbandman
himself
takes
with
his
own
hands
from
the
nursery
or
ground
and
plants
at
the
upper
end
of
the
beside
the
inlet
of
the
irrigation
water
they
are
planted
with
great
care
in
a
definite
order
one
of
them
in
the
middle
and
the
other
eight
in
a
circle
about
it
when
the
whole
field
has
been
planted
an
offering
which
usually
consists
of
rice
in
many
forms
is
made
to
the
principal
rice
when
the
begin
to
swell
the
rice
is
said
to
be
pregnant
and
the
principal
rice
is
treated
with
the
delicate
attentions
which
are
paid
to
a
woman
with
child
thus
and
eggs
are
laid
down
beside
it
and
sour
fruits
are
often
presented
to
it
because
pregnant
women
are
believed
to
long
for
sour
fruit
moreover
the
fertilisation
of
the
rice
by
the
irrigation
water
is
compared
to
the
union
of
the
goddess
batari
sri
with
her
husband
ida
batara
vishnu
who
is
identified
with
the
flowing
water
some
people
sprinkle
the
pregnant
rice
with
water
in
which
cooling
drugs
have
been
infused
or
with
water
which
has
stood
on
a
holy
grave
in
order
that
the
ears
may
fill
out
well
when
the
time
of
harvest
has
come
the
owner
of
the
field
himself
makes
a
beginning
by
cutting
the
principal
rice
or
with
his
own
hands
and
binding
it
into
two
sheaves
each
composed
of
one
hundred
and
eight
stalks
with
their
leaves
attached
to
them
one
of
the
sheaves
represents
a
man
and
the
other
a
woman
and
they
are
called
husband
and
wife
the
male
sheaf
is
wound
about
with
thread
so
that
none
of
the
leaves
are
visible
whereas
the
female
sheaf
has
its
leaves
bent
over
and
tied
so
as
to
resemble
the
roll
of
a
woman
s
hair
sometimes
for
further
distinction
a
necklace
of
is
tied
round
the
female
sheaf
the
two
sheaves
are
then
fastened
together
and
tied
to
a
branch
of
a
tree
which
is
stuck
in
the
ground
at
the
inlet
of
the
irrigation
water
there
they
remain
while
all
the
rest
of
the
rice
is
being
reaped
sometimes
instead
of
being
tied
to
a
bough
they
are
laid
on
a
little
bamboo
altar
the
reapers
at
their
work
take
great
care
to
let
no
grains
of
rice
fall
on
the
ground
otherwise
the
would
grieve
and
weep
at
being
parted
from
her
sisters
who
are
carried
to
the
barn
if
any
portion
of
the
field
remains
unreaped
at
nightfall
the
reapers
make
loops
in
the
leaves
of
some
of
the
standing
stalks
to
prevent
the
evil
spirits
from
proceeding
with
the
harvest
during
the
hours
of
darkness
or
according
to
another
account
lest
the
should
go
astray
when
the
rice
is
brought
home
from
the
field
the
two
sheaves
representing
the
husband
and
wife
are
carried
by
a
woman
on
her
head
and
are
the
last
of
all
to
be
deposited
in
the
barn
there
they
are
laid
to
rest
on
a
small
erection
or
on
a
cushion
of
along
with
three
lumps
of
which
are
regarded
as
the
attendants
or
watchers
of
the
bridal
pair
the
whole
arrangement
we
are
informed
has
for
its
object
to
induce
the
rice
to
increase
and
multiply
in
the
granary
so
that
the
owner
may
get
more
out
of
it
than
he
put
in
hence
when
the
people
of
bali
bring
the
two
sheaves
the
husband
and
wife
into
the
barn
they
say
increase
ye
and
multiply
without
when
a
woman
fetches
rice
from
the
granary
for
the
use
of
her
household
she
has
to
observe
a
number
of
rules
all
of
which
are
clearly
dictated
by
respect
for
the
spirit
of
the
rice
she
should
not
enter
the
barn
in
the
dark
or
at
noon
perhaps
because
the
spirit
may
then
be
supposed
to
be
sleeping
she
must
enter
with
her
right
foot
first
she
must
be
decently
clad
with
her
breasts
covered
she
must
not
chew
betel
and
she
would
do
well
to
rinse
her
mouth
before
repairing
to
the
barn
just
as
she
would
do
if
she
waited
on
a
person
of
distinction
or
on
a
divinity
no
sick
or
menstruous
woman
may
enter
the
barn
and
there
must
be
no
talking
in
it
just
as
there
must
be
no
talking
when
shelled
rice
is
being
scooped
up
when
all
the
rice
in
the
barn
has
been
used
up
the
two
sheaves
representing
the
husband
and
wife
remain
in
the
empty
building
till
they
have
gradually
disappeared
or
been
devoured
by
mice
the
pinch
of
hunger
sometimes
drives
individuals
to
eat
up
the
rice
of
these
two
sheaves
but
the
wretches
who
do
so
are
viewed
with
disgust
by
their
fellows
and
branded
as
pigs
and
dogs
nobody
would
ever
sell
these
holy
sheaves
with
the
rest
of
their
profane
brethren
the
same
notion
of
the
propagation
of
the
rice
by
a
male
and
female
power
finds
expression
amongst
the
szis
of
upper
burma
when
the
paddy
that
is
the
rice
with
the
husks
still
on
it
has
been
dried
and
piled
in
a
heap
for
threshing
all
the
friends
of
the
household
are
invited
to
the
and
food
and
drink
are
brought
out
the
heap
of
paddy
is
divided
and
one
half
spread
out
for
threshing
while
the
other
half
is
left
piled
up
on
the
pile
food
and
spirits
are
set
and
one
of
the
elders
addressing
the
father
and
mother
of
the
prays
for
plenteous
harvests
in
future
and
begs
that
the
seed
may
bear
many
fold
then
the
whole
party
eat
drink
and
make
merry
this
ceremony
at
the
is
the
only
occasion
when
these
people
invoke
the
father
and
mother
of
the
the
spirit
of
the
corn
embodied
in
human
beings
thus
the
theory
which
recognises
in
the
european
and
so
forth
the
embodiment
in
vegetable
form
of
the
animating
spirit
of
the
crops
is
amply
confirmed
by
the
evidence
of
peoples
in
other
parts
of
the
world
who
because
they
have
lagged
behind
the
european
races
in
mental
development
retain
for
that
very
reason
a
keener
sense
of
the
original
motives
for
observing
those
rustic
rites
which
among
ourselves
have
sunk
to
the
level
of
meaningless
survivals
the
reader
may
however
remember
that
according
to
mannhardt
whose
theory
i
am
expounding
the
spirit
of
the
corn
manifests
itself
not
merely
in
vegetable
but
also
in
human
form
the
person
who
cuts
the
last
sheaf
or
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
passes
for
a
temporary
embodiment
of
the
just
as
much
as
the
bunch
of
corn
which
he
reaps
or
threshes
now
in
the
parallels
which
have
been
hitherto
adduced
from
the
customs
of
peoples
outside
europe
the
spirit
of
the
crops
appears
only
in
vegetable
form
it
remains
therefore
to
prove
that
other
races
besides
our
european
peasantry
have
conceived
the
spirit
of
the
crops
as
incorporate
in
or
represented
by
living
men
and
women
such
a
proof
i
may
remind
the
reader
is
germane
to
the
theme
of
this
book
for
the
more
instances
we
discover
of
human
beings
representing
in
themselves
the
life
or
animating
spirit
of
plants
the
less
difficulty
will
be
felt
at
classing
amongst
them
the
king
of
the
wood
at
nemi
the
mandans
and
minnitarees
of
north
america
used
to
hold
a
festival
in
spring
which
they
called
the
festival
of
the
women
they
thought
that
a
certain
old
woman
who
never
dies
made
the
crops
to
grow
and
that
living
somewhere
in
the
south
she
sent
the
migratory
waterfowl
in
spring
as
her
tokens
and
representatives
each
sort
of
bird
represented
a
special
kind
of
crop
cultivated
by
the
indians
the
wild
goose
stood
for
the
maize
the
wild
swan
for
the
gourds
and
the
wild
duck
for
the
beans
so
when
the
feathered
messengers
of
the
old
woman
began
to
arrive
in
spring
the
indians
celebrated
the
festival
of
the
women
scaffolds
were
set
up
on
which
the
people
hung
dried
meat
and
other
things
by
way
of
offerings
to
the
old
woman
and
on
a
certain
day
the
old
women
of
the
tribe
as
representatives
of
the
old
woman
who
never
dies
assembled
at
the
scaffolds
each
bearing
in
her
hand
an
ear
of
maize
fastened
to
a
stick
they
first
planted
these
sticks
in
the
ground
then
danced
round
the
scaffolds
and
finally
took
up
the
sticks
again
in
their
arms
meanwhile
old
men
beat
drums
and
shook
rattles
as
a
musical
accompaniment
to
the
performance
of
the
old
women
further
young
women
came
and
put
dried
flesh
into
the
mouths
of
the
old
women
for
which
they
received
in
return
a
grain
of
the
consecrated
maize
to
eat
three
or
four
grains
of
the
holy
corn
were
also
placed
in
the
dishes
of
the
young
women
to
be
afterwards
carefully
mixed
with
the
which
they
were
supposed
to
fertilise
the
dried
flesh
hung
on
the
scaffold
belonged
to
the
old
women
because
they
represented
the
old
woman
who
never
dies
a
similar
festival
was
held
in
autumn
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
the
herds
of
buffaloes
and
securing
a
supply
of
meat
at
that
time
every
woman
carried
in
her
arms
an
uprooted
plant
of
maize
they
gave
the
name
of
the
old
woman
who
never
dies
both
to
the
maize
and
to
those
birds
which
they
regarded
as
symbols
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
they
prayed
to
them
in
autumn
saying
mother
have
pity
on
us
send
us
not
the
bitter
cold
too
soon
lest
we
have
not
meat
enough
let
not
all
the
game
depart
that
we
may
have
something
for
the
winter
in
autumn
when
the
birds
were
flying
south
the
indians
thought
that
they
were
going
home
to
the
old
woman
and
taking
to
her
the
offerings
that
had
been
hung
up
on
the
scaffolds
especially
the
dried
meat
which
she
ate
here
then
we
have
the
spirit
or
divinity
of
the
corn
conceived
as
an
old
woman
and
represented
in
bodily
form
by
old
women
who
in
their
capacity
of
representatives
receive
some
at
least
of
the
offerings
which
are
intended
for
her
the
miamis
another
tribe
of
north
american
indians
tell
a
tale
in
which
the
spirit
of
the
corn
figures
as
a
old
man
they
say
that
corn
that
is
maize
first
grew
in
heaven
and
that
the
good
spirit
commanded
it
to
go
down
and
dwell
with
men
on
earth
at
first
it
was
reluctant
to
do
so
but
the
good
spirit
prevailed
on
it
to
go
by
promising
that
men
would
treat
it
well
in
return
for
the
benefit
they
derived
from
it
so
corn
came
down
from
heaven
to
benefit
the
indian
and
this
is
the
reason
why
they
esteem
it
and
are
bound
to
take
good
care
of
it
and
to
nurture
it
and
not
raise
more
than
they
actually
require
for
their
own
but
once
a
whole
town
of
the
miamis
was
severely
punished
for
failing
in
respect
for
the
corn
they
had
raised
a
great
crop
and
stored
much
of
it
under
ground
and
much
of
it
they
packed
for
immediate
use
in
bags
but
the
corn
was
so
plentiful
that
much
of
it
still
remained
on
the
stalks
and
the
young
men
grew
reckless
and
played
with
the
shelled
cobs
throwing
them
at
each
other
and
at
last
they
even
broke
the
cobs
from
the
growing
stalks
and
pelted
each
other
with
them
too
but
a
judgment
soon
followed
on
such
wicked
conduct
for
when
the
hunters
went
out
to
hunt
though
the
deer
seemed
to
abound
they
could
kill
nothing
so
the
corn
was
gone
and
they
could
get
no
meat
and
the
people
were
hungry
well
one
of
the
hunters
roaming
by
himself
in
the
woods
to
find
something
to
eat
for
his
aged
father
came
upon
a
small
lodge
in
the
wilderness
where
a
decrepit
old
man
was
lying
with
his
back
to
the
fire
now
the
old
man
was
no
other
than
the
spirit
of
the
corn
he
said
to
the
young
hunter
my
grandson
the
indians
have
afflicted
me
much
and
reduced
me
to
the
sad
state
in
which
you
see
me
in
the
side
of
the
lodge
you
will
find
a
small
kettle
take
it
and
eat
and
when
you
have
satisfied
your
hunger
i
will
speak
to
but
the
kettle
was
full
of
such
fine
sweet
corn
as
the
hunter
had
never
in
his
life
seen
before
when
he
had
eaten
his
fill
the
old
man
resumed
the
thread
of
his
discourse
saying
your
people
have
wantonly
abused
and
reduced
me
to
the
state
you
now
see
me
in
my
is
broken
in
many
places
it
was
the
foolish
young
men
of
your
town
who
did
me
this
evil
for
i
am
mondamin
or
corn
that
came
down
from
heaven
in
their
play
they
threw
and
at
one
another
treating
me
with
contempt
i
am
the
whom
they
have
injured
that
is
why
you
experience
bad
luck
and
famine
i
am
the
cause
you
feel
my
just
resentment
therefore
your
people
are
punished
other
indians
do
not
treat
me
so
they
respect
me
and
so
it
is
well
with
them
had
you
no
elders
to
check
the
youths
at
their
wanton
sport
you
are
an
of
my
sufferings
they
are
the
effect
of
what
you
did
to
my
with
that
he
groaned
and
covered
himself
up
so
the
young
hunter
returned
and
reported
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
since
then
the
indians
have
been
very
careful
not
to
play
with
corn
in
the
ear
in
some
parts
of
india
the
gauri
is
represented
at
once
by
an
unmarried
girl
and
by
a
bundle
of
wild
balsam
plants
which
is
made
up
into
the
figure
of
a
woman
and
dressed
as
such
with
mask
garments
and
ornaments
both
the
human
and
the
vegetable
representative
of
the
goddess
are
worshipped
and
the
intention
of
the
whole
ceremony
appears
to
be
to
ensure
a
good
crop
of
rice
the
double
personification
of
the
corn
as
mother
and
daughter
compared
with
the
of
germany
and
the
of
scotland
the
demeter
and
persephone
of
greece
are
late
products
of
religious
growth
yet
as
members
of
the
aryan
family
the
greeks
must
at
one
time
or
another
have
observed
harvest
customs
like
those
which
are
still
practised
by
celts
teutons
and
slavs
and
which
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
aryan
world
have
been
practised
by
the
indians
of
peru
the
dyaks
of
borneo
and
many
other
natives
of
the
east
sufficient
proof
that
the
ideas
on
which
these
customs
rest
are
not
confined
to
any
one
race
but
naturally
suggest
themselves
to
all
untutored
peoples
engaged
in
agriculture
it
is
probable
therefore
that
demeter
and
persephone
those
stately
and
beautiful
figures
of
greek
mythology
grew
out
of
the
same
simple
beliefs
and
practices
which
still
prevail
among
our
modern
peasantry
and
that
they
were
represented
by
rude
dolls
made
out
of
the
yellow
sheaves
on
many
a
long
before
their
breathing
images
were
wrought
in
bronze
and
marble
by
the
master
hands
of
phidias
and
praxiteles
a
reminiscence
of
that
olden
scent
so
to
say
of
the
to
the
last
in
the
title
of
the
maiden
by
which
persephone
was
commonly
known
thus
if
the
prototype
of
demeter
is
the
of
germany
the
prototype
of
persephone
is
the
which
autumn
after
autumn
is
still
made
from
the
last
sheaf
on
the
braes
of
balquhidder
indeed
if
we
knew
more
about
the
of
ancient
greece
we
should
probably
find
that
even
in
classical
times
they
continued
annually
to
fashion
their
demeters
and
maidens
persephones
out
of
the
ripe
corn
on
the
but
unfortunately
the
demeter
and
persephone
whom
we
know
were
the
denizens
of
towns
the
majestic
inhabitants
of
lordly
temples
it
was
for
such
divinities
alone
that
the
refined
writers
of
antiquity
had
eyes
the
uncouth
rites
performed
by
rustics
amongst
the
corn
were
beneath
their
notice
even
if
they
noticed
them
they
probably
never
dreamed
of
any
connexion
between
the
puppet
of
on
the
sunny
and
the
marble
divinity
in
the
shady
coolness
of
the
temple
still
the
writings
even
of
these
and
cultured
persons
afford
us
an
occasional
glimpse
of
a
demeter
as
rude
as
the
rudest
that
a
remote
german
village
can
shew
thus
the
story
that
iasion
begat
a
child
plutus
wealth
abundance
by
demeter
on
a
field
may
be
compared
with
the
west
prussian
custom
of
the
mock
birth
of
a
child
on
the
in
this
prussian
custom
the
pretended
mother
represents
the
the
pretended
child
represents
the
and
the
whole
ceremony
is
a
charm
to
ensure
a
crop
next
year
the
custom
and
the
legend
alike
point
to
an
older
practice
of
performing
among
the
sprouting
crops
in
spring
or
the
stubble
in
autumn
one
of
those
real
or
mimic
acts
of
procreation
by
which
as
we
have
seen
primitive
man
often
seeks
to
infuse
his
own
vigorous
life
into
the
languid
or
decaying
energies
of
nature
another
glimpse
of
the
savage
under
the
civilised
demeter
will
be
afforded
farther
on
when
we
come
to
deal
with
another
aspect
of
these
agricultural
divinities
the
reader
may
have
observed
that
in
modern
the
is
generally
represented
either
by
a
old
woman
etc
or
by
a
maiden
etc
not
both
by
a
and
by
a
maiden
why
then
did
the
greeks
represent
the
corn
both
as
a
mother
and
a
daughter
in
the
breton
custom
the
large
figure
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
with
a
small
inside
of
represents
both
the
and
the
the
latter
still
unborn
again
in
the
prussian
custom
just
referred
to
the
woman
who
plays
the
part
of
represents
the
ripe
grain
the
child
appears
to
represent
next
year
s
corn
which
may
be
regarded
naturally
enough
as
the
child
of
this
year
s
corn
since
it
is
from
the
seed
of
this
year
s
harvest
that
next
year
s
crop
will
spring
further
we
have
seen
that
among
the
malays
of
the
peninsula
and
sometimes
among
the
highlanders
of
scotland
the
spirit
of
the
grain
is
represented
in
double
female
form
both
as
old
and
young
by
means
of
ears
taken
alike
from
the
ripe
crop
in
scotland
the
old
spirit
of
the
corn
appears
as
the
carline
or
the
young
spirit
as
the
maiden
while
among
the
malays
of
the
peninsula
the
two
spirits
of
the
rice
are
definitely
related
to
each
other
as
mother
and
child
judged
by
these
analogies
demeter
would
be
the
ripe
crop
of
this
year
persephone
would
be
the
taken
from
it
and
sown
in
autumn
to
reappear
in
spring
the
descent
of
persephone
into
the
lower
world
would
thus
be
a
mythical
expression
for
the
sowing
of
the
seed
her
reappearance
in
spring
would
signify
the
sprouting
of
the
young
corn
in
this
way
the
persephone
of
one
year
becomes
the
demeter
of
the
next
and
this
may
very
well
have
been
the
original
form
of
the
myth
but
when
with
the
advance
of
religious
thought
the
corn
came
to
be
personified
no
longer
as
a
being
that
went
through
the
whole
cycle
of
birth
growth
reproduction
and
death
within
a
year
but
as
an
immortal
goddess
consistency
required
that
one
of
the
two
personifications
the
mother
or
the
daughter
should
be
sacrificed
however
the
double
conception
of
the
corn
as
mother
and
daughter
may
have
been
too
old
and
too
deeply
rooted
in
the
popular
mind
to
be
eradicated
by
logic
and
so
room
had
to
be
found
in
the
reformed
myth
both
for
mother
and
daughter
this
was
done
by
assigning
to
persephone
the
character
of
the
corn
sown
in
autumn
and
sprouting
in
spring
while
demeter
was
left
to
play
the
somewhat
vague
part
of
the
heavy
mother
of
the
corn
who
laments
its
annual
disappearance
underground
and
rejoices
over
its
reappearance
in
spring
thus
instead
of
a
regular
succession
of
divine
beings
each
living
a
year
and
then
giving
birth
to
her
successor
the
reformed
myth
exhibits
the
conception
of
two
divine
and
immortal
beings
one
of
whom
annually
disappears
into
and
reappears
from
the
ground
while
the
other
has
little
to
do
but
to
weep
and
rejoice
at
the
appropriate
seasons
this
theory
of
the
double
personification
of
the
corn
in
greek
myth
assumes
that
both
personifications
demeter
and
persephone
are
original
but
if
we
suppose
that
the
greek
myth
started
with
a
single
personification
the
of
a
second
personification
may
perhaps
be
explained
as
follows
on
looking
over
the
harvest
customs
which
have
been
passed
under
review
it
may
be
noticed
that
they
involve
two
distinct
conceptions
of
the
for
whereas
in
some
of
the
customs
the
is
treated
as
immanent
in
the
corn
in
others
it
is
regarded
as
external
to
it
thus
when
a
particular
sheaf
is
called
by
the
name
of
the
and
is
dressed
in
clothes
and
handled
with
reverence
the
spirit
is
clearly
regarded
as
immanent
in
the
corn
but
when
the
spirit
is
said
to
make
the
crops
grow
by
passing
through
them
or
to
blight
the
grain
of
those
against
whom
she
has
a
grudge
she
is
apparently
conceived
as
distinct
from
though
exercising
power
over
the
corn
conceived
in
the
latter
way
the
is
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
deity
of
the
corn
if
she
has
not
become
so
already
of
these
two
conceptions
that
of
the
as
immanent
in
the
corn
is
doubtless
the
older
since
the
view
of
nature
as
animated
by
indwelling
spirits
appears
to
have
generally
preceded
the
view
of
it
as
controlled
by
external
deities
to
put
it
shortly
animism
precedes
deism
in
the
harvest
customs
of
our
european
peasantry
the
seems
to
be
conceived
now
as
immanent
in
the
corn
and
now
as
external
to
it
in
greek
mythology
on
the
other
hand
demeter
is
viewed
rather
as
the
deity
of
the
corn
than
as
the
spirit
immanent
in
it
the
process
of
thought
which
leads
to
the
change
from
the
one
mode
of
conception
to
the
other
is
anthropomorphism
or
the
gradual
investment
of
the
immanent
spirits
with
more
and
more
of
the
attributes
of
humanity
as
men
emerge
from
savagery
the
tendency
to
humanise
their
divinities
gains
strength
and
the
more
human
these
become
the
wider
is
the
breach
which
severs
them
from
the
natural
objects
of
which
they
were
at
first
merely
the
animating
spirits
or
souls
but
in
the
progress
upwards
from
savagery
men
of
the
same
generation
do
not
march
abreast
and
though
the
new
anthropomorphic
gods
may
satisfy
the
religious
wants
of
the
more
developed
intelligences
the
backward
members
of
the
community
will
cling
by
preference
to
the
old
animistic
notions
now
when
the
spirit
of
any
natural
object
such
as
the
corn
has
been
invested
with
human
qualities
detached
from
the
object
and
converted
into
a
deity
controlling
it
the
object
itself
is
by
the
withdrawal
of
its
spirit
left
inanimate
it
becomes
so
to
say
a
spiritual
vacuum
but
the
popular
fancy
intolerant
of
such
a
vacuum
in
other
words
unable
to
conceive
anything
as
inanimate
immediately
creates
a
fresh
mythical
being
with
which
it
peoples
the
vacant
object
thus
the
same
natural
object
comes
to
be
represented
in
mythology
by
two
distinct
beings
first
by
the
old
spirit
now
separated
from
it
and
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
deity
second
by
the
new
spirit
freshly
created
by
the
popular
fancy
to
supply
the
place
vacated
by
the
old
spirit
on
its
elevation
to
a
higher
sphere
for
example
in
japanese
religion
the
solar
character
of
the
great
goddess
of
the
sun
has
become
obscured
and
accordingly
the
people
have
personified
the
sun
afresh
under
the
name
of
personage
and
tentō
to
the
lower
class
of
japanese
at
the
present
day
especially
to
women
and
children
tentō
is
the
actual
sun
sexless
mythless
and
unencumbered
by
any
formal
worship
yet
looked
up
to
as
a
moral
being
who
rewards
the
good
punishes
the
wicked
and
enforces
oaths
made
in
his
name
in
such
cases
the
problem
for
mythology
is
having
got
two
distinct
personifications
of
the
same
object
what
to
do
with
them
how
are
their
relations
to
each
other
to
be
adjusted
and
room
found
for
both
in
the
mythological
system
when
the
old
spirit
or
new
deity
is
conceived
as
creating
or
producing
the
object
in
question
the
problem
is
easily
solved
since
the
object
is
believed
to
be
produced
by
the
old
spirit
and
animated
by
the
new
one
the
latter
as
the
soul
of
the
object
must
also
owe
its
existence
to
the
former
thus
the
old
spirit
will
stand
to
the
new
one
as
producer
to
produced
that
is
in
mythology
as
parent
to
child
and
if
both
spirits
are
conceived
as
female
their
relation
will
be
that
of
mother
and
daughter
in
this
way
starting
from
a
single
personification
of
the
corn
as
female
mythic
fancy
might
in
time
reach
a
double
personification
of
it
as
mother
and
daughter
it
would
be
very
rash
to
affirm
that
this
was
the
way
in
which
the
myth
of
demeter
and
persephone
actually
took
shape
but
it
seems
a
legitimate
conjecture
that
the
reduplication
of
deities
of
which
demeter
and
persephone
furnish
an
example
may
sometimes
have
arisen
in
the
way
indicated
for
example
among
the
pairs
of
deities
dealt
with
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
it
has
been
shewn
that
there
are
grounds
for
regarding
both
isis
and
her
companion
god
osiris
as
personifications
of
the
corn
on
the
hypothesis
just
suggested
isis
would
be
the
old
and
osiris
would
be
the
newer
one
whose
relationship
to
the
old
spirit
was
variously
explained
as
that
of
brother
husband
and
son
for
of
course
mythology
would
always
be
free
to
account
for
the
coexistence
of
the
two
divinities
in
more
ways
than
one
it
must
not
however
be
forgotten
that
this
proposed
explanation
of
such
pairs
of
deities
as
demeter
and
persephone
or
isis
and
osiris
is
purely
conjectural
and
is
only
given
for
what
it
is
worth
chapter
vii
lityerses
songs
of
the
corn
reapers
in
the
preceding
pages
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
shew
that
in
the
and
of
northern
europe
we
have
the
prototypes
of
demeter
and
persephone
but
an
essential
feature
is
still
wanting
to
complete
the
resemblance
a
leading
incident
in
the
greek
myth
is
the
death
and
resurrection
of
persephone
it
is
this
incident
which
coupled
with
the
nature
of
the
goddess
as
a
deity
of
vegetation
links
the
myth
with
the
cults
of
adonis
attis
osiris
and
dionysus
and
it
is
in
virtue
of
this
incident
that
the
myth
finds
a
place
in
our
discussion
of
the
dying
god
it
remains
therefore
to
see
whether
the
conception
of
the
annual
death
and
resurrection
of
a
god
which
figures
so
prominently
in
these
great
greek
and
oriental
worships
has
not
also
its
origin
or
its
analogy
in
the
rustic
rites
observed
by
reapers
and
amongst
the
and
the
vines
our
general
ignorance
of
the
popular
superstitions
and
customs
of
the
ancients
has
already
been
confessed
but
the
obscurity
which
thus
hangs
over
the
first
beginnings
of
ancient
religion
is
fortunately
dissipated
to
some
extent
in
the
present
case
the
worships
of
osiris
adonis
and
attis
had
their
respective
seats
as
we
have
seen
in
egypt
syria
and
phrygia
and
in
each
of
these
countries
certain
harvest
and
vintage
customs
are
known
to
have
been
observed
the
resemblance
of
which
to
each
other
and
to
the
national
rites
struck
the
ancients
themselves
and
compared
with
the
harvest
customs
of
modern
peasants
and
barbarians
seems
to
throw
some
light
on
the
origin
of
the
rites
in
question
it
has
been
already
mentioned
on
the
authority
of
diodorus
that
in
ancient
egypt
the
reapers
were
wont
to
lament
over
the
first
sheaf
cut
invoking
isis
as
the
goddess
to
whom
they
owed
the
discovery
of
corn
to
the
plaintive
song
or
cry
sung
or
uttered
by
egyptian
reapers
the
greeks
gave
the
name
of
maneros
and
explained
the
name
by
a
story
that
maneros
the
only
son
of
the
first
egyptian
king
invented
agriculture
and
dying
an
untimely
death
was
thus
lamented
by
the
people
it
appears
however
that
the
name
maneros
is
due
to
a
misunderstanding
of
the
formula
come
to
the
house
which
has
been
discovered
in
various
egyptian
writings
for
example
in
the
dirge
of
isis
in
the
book
of
the
dead
hence
we
may
suppose
that
the
cry
was
chanted
by
the
reapers
over
the
cut
corn
as
a
dirge
for
the
death
of
the
isis
or
osiris
and
a
prayer
for
its
return
as
the
cry
was
raised
over
the
first
ears
reaped
it
would
seem
that
the
was
believed
by
the
egyptians
to
be
present
in
the
first
corn
cut
and
to
die
under
the
sickle
we
have
seen
that
in
the
malay
peninsula
and
java
the
first
ears
of
rice
are
taken
to
represent
either
the
soul
of
the
rice
or
the
and
the
in
parts
of
russia
the
first
sheaf
is
treated
much
in
the
same
way
that
the
last
sheaf
is
treated
elsewhere
it
is
reaped
by
the
mistress
herself
taken
home
and
set
in
the
place
of
honour
near
the
holy
pictures
afterwards
it
is
threshed
separately
and
some
of
its
grain
is
mixed
with
the
next
year
s
in
aberdeenshire
while
the
last
corn
cut
was
generally
used
to
make
the
sheaf
it
was
sometimes
though
rarely
the
first
corn
cut
that
was
dressed
up
as
a
woman
and
carried
home
with
ceremony
in
phoenicia
and
western
asia
a
plaintive
song
like
that
chanted
by
the
egyptian
was
sung
at
the
vintage
and
probably
to
judge
by
analogy
also
at
harvest
this
phoenician
song
was
called
by
the
greeks
linus
or
ailinus
and
explained
like
maneros
as
a
lament
for
the
death
of
a
youth
named
linus
according
to
one
story
linus
was
brought
up
by
a
shepherd
but
torn
to
pieces
by
his
dogs
but
like
maneros
the
name
linus
or
ailinus
appears
to
have
originated
in
a
verbal
misunderstanding
and
to
be
nothing
more
than
the
cry
that
is
woe
to
us
which
the
phoenicians
probably
uttered
in
mourning
for
adonis
at
least
sappho
seems
to
have
regarded
adonis
and
linus
as
equivalent
in
bithynia
a
like
mournful
ditty
called
bormus
or
borimus
was
chanted
by
mariandynian
reapers
bormus
was
said
to
have
been
a
handsome
youth
the
son
of
king
upias
or
of
a
wealthy
and
distinguished
man
one
summer
day
watching
the
reapers
at
work
in
his
fields
he
went
to
fetch
them
a
drink
of
water
and
was
never
heard
of
more
so
the
reapers
sought
for
him
calling
him
in
plaintive
strains
which
they
continued
to
chant
at
harvest
ever
afterwards
killing
the
in
phrygia
the
corresponding
song
sung
by
harvesters
both
at
reaping
and
at
threshing
was
called
lityerses
according
to
one
story
lityerses
was
a
bastard
son
of
midas
king
of
phrygia
and
dwelt
at
celaenae
he
used
to
reap
the
corn
and
had
an
enormous
appetite
when
a
stranger
happened
to
enter
the
or
to
pass
by
it
lityerses
gave
him
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
then
took
him
to
the
on
the
banks
of
the
maeander
and
compelled
him
to
reap
along
with
him
lastly
it
was
his
custom
to
wrap
the
stranger
in
a
sheaf
cut
off
his
head
with
a
sickle
and
carry
away
his
body
swathed
in
the
corn
stalks
but
at
last
hercules
undertook
to
reap
with
him
cut
off
his
head
with
the
sickle
and
threw
his
body
into
the
river
as
hercules
is
reported
to
have
slain
lityerses
in
the
same
way
that
lityerses
slew
others
as
theseus
treated
sinis
and
sciron
we
may
infer
that
lityerses
used
to
throw
the
bodies
of
his
victims
into
the
river
according
to
another
version
of
the
story
lityerses
a
son
of
midas
was
wont
to
challenge
people
to
a
reaping
match
with
him
and
if
he
vanquished
them
he
used
to
thrash
them
but
one
day
he
met
with
a
stronger
reaper
who
slew
him
there
are
some
grounds
for
supposing
that
in
these
stories
of
lityerses
we
have
the
description
of
a
phrygian
harvest
custom
in
accordance
with
which
certain
persons
especially
strangers
passing
the
harvest
field
were
regularly
regarded
as
embodiments
of
the
and
as
such
were
seized
by
the
reapers
wrapt
in
sheaves
and
beheaded
their
bodies
bound
up
in
the
being
afterwards
thrown
into
water
as
a
the
grounds
for
this
supposition
are
first
the
resemblance
of
the
lityerses
story
to
the
harvest
customs
of
european
peasantry
and
second
the
frequency
of
human
sacrifices
offered
by
savage
races
to
promote
the
fertility
of
the
fields
we
will
examine
these
grounds
successively
beginning
with
the
former
in
comparing
the
story
with
the
harvest
customs
of
europe
three
points
deserve
special
attention
namely
the
reaping
match
and
the
binding
of
persons
in
the
sheaves
ii
the
killing
of
the
or
his
representatives
iii
the
treatment
of
visitors
to
the
harvest
field
or
of
strangers
passing
it
i
in
regard
to
the
first
head
we
have
seen
that
in
modern
europe
the
person
who
cuts
or
binds
or
threshes
the
last
sheaf
is
often
exposed
to
rough
treatment
at
the
hands
of
his
for
example
he
is
bound
up
in
the
last
sheaf
and
thus
encased
is
carried
or
carted
about
beaten
drenched
with
water
thrown
on
a
dunghill
and
so
forth
or
if
he
is
spared
this
horseplay
he
is
at
least
the
subject
of
ridicule
or
is
thought
to
be
destined
to
suffer
some
misfortune
in
the
course
of
the
year
hence
the
harvesters
are
naturally
reluctant
to
give
the
last
cut
at
reaping
or
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
or
to
bind
the
last
sheaf
and
towards
the
close
of
the
work
this
reluctance
produces
an
emulation
among
the
labourers
each
striving
to
finish
his
task
as
fast
as
possible
in
order
that
he
may
escape
the
invidious
distinction
of
being
last
for
example
in
the
neighbourhood
of
danzig
when
the
winter
corn
is
cut
and
mostly
bound
up
in
sheaves
the
portion
which
still
remains
to
be
bound
is
divided
amongst
the
women
binders
each
of
whom
receives
a
swath
of
equal
length
to
bind
a
crowd
of
reapers
children
and
idlers
gather
round
to
witness
the
contest
and
at
the
word
seize
the
old
man
the
women
fall
to
work
all
binding
their
allotted
swaths
as
hard
as
they
can
the
spectators
watch
them
narrowly
and
the
woman
who
can
not
keep
pace
with
the
rest
and
consequently
binds
the
last
sheaf
has
to
carry
the
old
man
that
is
the
last
sheaf
made
up
in
the
form
of
a
man
to
the
farmhouse
and
deliver
it
to
the
farmer
with
the
words
here
i
bring
you
the
old
at
the
supper
which
follows
the
old
man
is
placed
at
the
table
and
receives
an
abundant
portion
of
food
which
as
he
can
not
eat
it
falls
to
the
share
of
the
woman
who
carried
him
afterwards
the
old
man
is
placed
in
the
yard
and
all
the
people
dance
round
him
or
the
woman
who
bound
the
last
sheaf
dances
for
a
good
while
with
the
old
man
while
the
rest
form
a
ring
round
them
afterwards
they
all
one
after
the
other
dance
a
single
round
with
him
further
the
woman
who
bound
the
last
sheaf
goes
herself
by
the
name
of
the
old
man
till
the
next
harvest
and
is
often
mocked
with
the
cry
here
comes
the
old
in
the
mittelmark
district
of
prussia
when
the
rye
has
been
reaped
and
the
last
sheaves
are
about
to
be
tied
up
the
binders
stand
in
two
rows
facing
each
other
every
woman
with
her
sheaf
and
her
straw
rope
before
her
at
a
given
signal
they
all
tie
up
their
sheaves
and
the
one
who
is
the
last
to
finish
is
ridiculed
by
the
rest
not
only
so
but
her
sheaf
is
made
up
into
human
shape
and
called
the
old
man
and
she
must
carry
it
home
to
the
farmyard
where
the
harvesters
dance
in
a
circle
round
her
and
it
then
they
take
the
old
man
to
the
farmer
and
deliver
it
to
him
with
the
words
we
bring
the
old
man
to
the
master
he
may
keep
him
till
he
gets
a
new
after
that
the
old
man
is
set
up
against
a
tree
where
he
remains
for
a
long
time
the
butt
of
many
jests
at
aschbach
in
bavaria
when
the
reaping
is
nearly
finished
the
reapers
say
now
we
will
drive
out
the
old
each
of
them
sets
himself
to
reap
a
patch
of
corn
as
fast
as
he
can
he
who
cuts
the
last
handful
or
the
last
stalk
is
greeted
by
the
rest
with
an
exulting
cry
you
have
the
old
sometimes
a
black
mask
is
fastened
on
the
reaper
s
face
and
he
is
dressed
in
woman
s
clothes
or
if
the
reaper
is
a
woman
she
is
dressed
in
man
s
clothes
a
dance
follows
at
the
supper
the
old
man
gets
twice
as
large
a
portion
of
food
as
the
others
the
proceedings
are
similar
at
threshing
the
person
who
gives
the
last
stroke
is
said
to
have
the
old
man
at
the
supper
given
to
the
threshers
he
has
to
eat
out
of
the
and
to
drink
a
great
deal
moreover
he
is
quizzed
and
teased
in
all
sorts
of
ways
till
he
frees
himself
from
further
annoyance
by
treating
the
others
to
brandy
or
beer
these
examples
illustrate
the
contests
in
reaping
threshing
and
binding
which
take
place
amongst
the
harvesters
from
their
unwillingness
to
suffer
the
ridicule
and
discomfort
incurred
by
the
one
who
happens
to
finish
his
work
last
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
person
who
is
last
at
reaping
binding
or
threshing
is
regarded
as
the
representative
of
the
and
this
idea
is
more
fully
expressed
by
binding
him
or
her
in
the
latter
custom
has
been
already
illustrated
but
a
few
more
instances
may
be
added
at
kloxin
near
stettin
the
harvesters
call
out
to
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
you
have
the
old
man
and
must
keep
the
old
man
is
a
great
bundle
of
corn
decked
with
flowers
and
ribbons
and
fashioned
into
a
rude
semblance
of
the
human
form
it
is
fastened
on
a
rake
or
strapped
on
a
horse
and
brought
with
music
to
the
village
in
delivering
the
old
man
to
the
farmer
the
woman
says
dear
sir
is
the
old
can
stay
no
longer
on
the
field
can
hide
himself
no
longer
must
come
into
the
and
gentlemen
pray
be
so
to
give
the
old
man
a
as
late
as
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
custom
was
to
tie
up
the
woman
herself
in
and
bring
her
with
music
to
the
farmhouse
where
the
harvesters
danced
with
her
till
the
fell
off
in
other
villages
round
stettin
when
the
last
is
being
loaded
there
is
a
regular
race
amongst
the
women
each
striving
not
to
be
last
for
she
who
places
the
last
sheaf
on
the
waggon
is
called
the
old
man
and
is
completely
swathed
in
she
is
also
decked
with
flowers
and
flowers
and
a
helmet
of
straw
are
placed
on
her
head
in
solemn
procession
she
carries
the
to
the
squire
over
whose
head
she
holds
it
while
she
utters
a
string
of
good
wishes
at
the
dance
which
follows
the
old
man
has
the
right
to
choose
his
or
rather
her
partner
it
is
an
honour
to
dance
with
him
at
blankenfelde
in
the
district
of
potsdam
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
at
the
is
saluted
with
the
cry
you
have
the
old
a
woman
is
then
tied
up
in
the
last
sheaf
in
such
a
way
that
only
her
head
is
left
free
her
hair
also
is
covered
with
a
cap
made
of
adorned
with
ribbons
and
flowers
she
is
called
the
and
must
keep
dancing
in
front
of
the
last
till
it
reaches
the
squire
s
house
where
she
receives
a
present
and
is
released
from
her
envelope
of
corn
at
gommern
near
magdeburg
the
reaper
who
cuts
the
last
ears
of
corn
is
often
wrapt
up
in
so
completely
that
it
is
hard
to
see
whether
there
is
a
man
in
the
bundle
or
not
thus
wrapt
up
he
is
taken
by
another
stalwart
reaper
on
his
back
and
carried
round
the
field
amidst
the
joyous
cries
of
the
harvesters
at
neuhausen
near
merseburg
the
person
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
is
wrapt
in
ears
of
oats
and
saluted
as
the
whereupon
the
others
dance
round
him
at
brie
isle
de
france
the
farmer
himself
is
tied
up
in
the
sheaf
at
the
at
udvarhely
transylvania
a
person
is
encased
in
and
wears
on
his
head
a
crown
made
out
of
the
last
ears
cut
on
reaching
the
village
he
is
soused
with
water
over
and
over
at
dingelstedt
in
the
district
of
erfurt
down
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
the
custom
to
tie
up
a
man
in
the
last
sheaf
he
was
called
the
old
man
and
was
brought
home
on
the
last
waggon
amid
huzzas
and
music
on
reaching
the
farmyard
he
was
rolled
round
the
barn
and
drenched
with
water
at
nördlingen
in
bavaria
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
wrapt
in
straw
and
rolled
on
the
in
some
parts
of
oberpfalz
bavaria
he
is
said
to
get
the
old
man
is
wrapt
in
straw
and
carried
to
a
neighbour
who
has
not
yet
finished
his
threshing
in
silesia
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
has
to
submit
to
a
good
deal
of
she
is
pushed
knocked
down
and
tied
up
in
the
sheaf
after
which
she
is
called
the
in
thüringen
a
sausage
is
stuck
in
the
last
sheaf
at
threshing
and
thrown
with
the
sheaf
on
the
it
is
called
the
or
and
is
eaten
by
all
the
threshers
after
they
have
eaten
it
a
man
is
encased
in
and
thus
attired
is
led
through
the
village
in
all
these
cases
the
idea
is
that
the
spirit
of
the
old
man
of
driven
out
of
the
corn
last
cut
or
last
threshed
and
lives
in
the
barn
during
the
winter
at
he
goes
out
again
to
the
fields
to
resume
his
activity
as
animating
force
among
the
sprouting
ideas
of
the
same
sort
appear
to
attach
to
the
last
corn
in
india
at
hoshangábád
in
central
india
when
the
reaping
is
nearly
done
a
patch
of
corn
about
a
rood
in
extent
is
left
standing
in
the
cultivator
s
last
field
and
the
reapers
rest
a
little
then
they
rush
at
this
remnant
tear
it
up
and
cast
it
into
the
air
shouting
victory
to
one
or
other
of
the
local
gods
according
to
their
religious
persuasion
a
sheaf
is
made
out
of
this
corn
tied
to
a
bamboo
set
up
in
the
last
harvest
cart
and
carried
home
in
triumph
here
it
is
fastened
up
in
the
or
attached
to
a
tree
or
to
the
where
its
services
are
held
to
be
essential
for
the
purpose
of
averting
the
a
like
custom
prevails
in
the
eastern
districts
of
the
provinces
of
india
sometimes
a
little
patch
is
left
untilled
as
a
refuge
for
the
sometimes
it
is
sown
and
when
the
corn
of
this
patch
has
been
reaped
with
a
rush
and
a
shout
it
is
presented
to
the
priest
who
offers
it
to
the
local
gods
or
bestows
it
on
a
beggar
ii
passing
to
the
second
point
of
comparison
between
the
lityerses
story
and
european
harvest
customs
we
have
now
to
see
that
in
the
latter
the
is
often
believed
to
be
killed
at
reaping
or
threshing
in
the
romsdal
and
other
parts
of
norway
when
the
haymaking
is
over
the
people
say
that
the
old
has
been
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
said
to
have
killed
the
the
or
the
according
to
the
crop
in
the
canton
of
tillot
in
lothringen
at
threshing
the
last
corn
the
men
keep
time
with
their
flails
calling
out
as
they
thresh
we
are
killing
the
old
woman
we
are
killing
the
old
woman
if
there
is
an
old
woman
in
the
house
she
is
warned
to
save
herself
or
she
will
be
struck
dead
near
ragnit
in
lithuania
the
last
handful
of
corn
is
left
standing
by
itself
with
the
words
the
old
woman
is
sitting
in
then
a
young
reaper
whets
his
scythe
and
with
a
strong
sweep
cuts
down
the
handful
it
is
now
said
of
him
that
he
has
cut
off
the
boba
s
head
and
he
receives
a
gratuity
from
the
farmer
and
a
jugful
of
water
over
his
head
from
the
farmer
s
wife
according
to
another
account
every
lithuanian
reaper
makes
haste
to
finish
his
task
for
the
old
lives
in
the
last
stalks
and
whoever
cuts
the
last
stalks
kills
the
old
and
by
killing
her
he
brings
trouble
on
himself
in
wilkischken
in
the
district
of
tilsit
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
corn
goes
by
the
name
of
the
killer
of
the
in
lithuania
again
the
is
believed
to
be
killed
at
threshing
as
well
as
at
reaping
when
only
a
single
pile
of
corn
remains
to
be
threshed
all
the
threshers
suddenly
step
back
a
few
paces
as
if
at
the
word
of
command
then
they
fall
to
work
plying
their
flails
with
the
utmost
rapidity
and
vehemence
till
they
come
to
the
last
bundle
upon
this
they
fling
themselves
with
almost
frantic
fury
straining
every
nerve
and
raining
blows
on
it
till
the
word
halt
rings
out
sharply
from
the
leader
the
man
whose
flail
is
the
last
to
fall
after
the
command
to
stop
has
been
given
is
immediately
surrounded
by
all
the
rest
crying
out
that
he
has
struck
the
old
he
has
to
expiate
the
deed
by
treating
them
to
brandy
and
like
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
corn
he
is
known
as
the
killer
of
the
old
sometimes
in
lithuania
the
slain
was
represented
by
a
puppet
thus
a
female
figure
was
made
out
of
dressed
in
clothes
and
placed
on
the
under
the
heap
of
corn
which
was
to
be
threshed
last
whoever
thereafter
gave
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
struck
the
old
woman
we
have
already
met
with
examples
of
burning
the
figure
which
represents
the
in
the
east
riding
of
yorkshire
a
custom
called
burning
the
old
witch
is
observed
on
the
last
day
of
harvest
a
small
sheaf
of
corn
is
burnt
on
the
field
in
a
fire
of
stubble
peas
are
parched
at
the
fire
and
eaten
with
a
liberal
allowance
of
ale
and
the
lads
and
lasses
romp
about
the
flames
and
amuse
themselves
by
blackening
each
other
s
faces
sometimes
again
the
is
represented
by
a
man
who
lies
down
under
the
last
corn
it
is
threshed
upon
his
body
and
the
people
say
that
the
old
man
is
being
beaten
to
we
saw
that
sometimes
the
farmer
s
wife
is
thrust
together
with
the
last
sheaf
under
the
as
if
to
thresh
her
and
that
afterwards
a
pretence
is
made
of
winnowing
her
at
volders
in
the
tyrol
husks
of
corn
are
stuck
behind
the
neck
of
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
and
he
is
throttled
with
a
straw
garland
if
he
is
tall
it
is
believed
that
the
corn
will
be
tall
next
year
then
he
is
tied
on
a
bundle
and
flung
into
the
river
in
carinthia
the
thresher
who
gave
the
last
stroke
and
the
person
who
untied
the
last
sheaf
on
the
are
bound
hand
and
foot
with
straw
bands
and
crowns
of
straw
are
placed
on
their
heads
then
they
are
tied
face
to
face
on
a
sledge
dragged
through
the
village
and
flung
into
a
brook
the
custom
of
throwing
the
representative
of
the
into
a
stream
like
that
of
drenching
him
with
water
is
as
usual
a
iii
thus
far
the
representatives
of
the
have
generally
been
the
man
or
woman
who
cuts
binds
or
threshes
the
last
corn
we
now
come
to
the
cases
in
which
the
is
represented
either
by
a
stranger
passing
the
as
in
the
lityerses
tale
or
by
a
visitor
entering
it
for
the
first
time
all
over
germany
it
is
customary
for
the
reapers
or
threshers
to
lay
hold
of
passing
strangers
and
bind
them
with
a
rope
made
of
till
they
pay
a
forfeit
and
when
the
farmer
himself
or
one
of
his
guests
enters
the
field
or
the
for
the
first
time
he
is
treated
in
the
same
way
sometimes
the
rope
is
only
tied
round
his
arm
or
his
feet
or
his
neck
but
sometimes
he
is
regularly
swathed
in
corn
thus
at
solör
in
norway
whoever
enters
the
field
be
he
the
master
or
a
stranger
is
tied
up
in
a
sheaf
and
must
pay
a
ransom
in
the
neighbourhood
of
soest
when
the
farmer
visits
the
for
the
first
time
he
is
completely
enveloped
in
flax
are
also
surrounded
by
the
women
tied
up
in
flax
and
compelled
to
stand
brandy
at
nördlingen
strangers
are
caught
with
straw
ropes
and
tied
up
in
a
sheaf
till
they
pay
a
forfeit
among
the
germans
of
haselberg
in
west
bohemia
as
soon
as
a
farmer
had
given
the
last
corn
to
be
threshed
on
the
he
was
swathed
in
it
and
had
to
redeem
himself
by
a
present
of
cakes
in
anhalt
when
the
proprietor
or
one
of
his
family
the
steward
or
even
a
stranger
enters
the
for
the
first
time
after
the
reaping
has
begun
the
wife
of
the
chief
reaper
ties
a
rope
twisted
of
or
a
nosegay
made
of
and
flowers
to
his
arm
and
he
is
obliged
to
ransom
himself
by
the
payment
of
a
fine
in
the
canton
of
putanges
in
normandy
a
pretence
of
tying
up
the
owner
of
the
land
in
the
last
sheaf
of
wheat
is
still
practised
or
at
least
was
still
practised
some
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
task
falls
to
the
women
alone
they
throw
themselves
on
the
proprietor
seize
him
by
the
arms
the
legs
and
the
body
throw
him
to
the
ground
and
stretch
him
on
the
last
sheaf
then
a
show
is
made
of
binding
him
and
the
conditions
to
be
observed
at
the
are
dictated
to
him
when
he
has
accepted
them
he
is
released
and
allowed
to
get
up
at
brie
isle
de
france
when
any
one
who
does
not
belong
to
the
farm
passes
by
the
the
reapers
give
chase
if
they
catch
him
they
bind
him
in
a
sheaf
and
bite
him
one
after
the
other
in
the
forehead
crying
you
shall
carry
the
key
of
the
to
have
the
key
is
an
expression
used
by
harvesters
elsewhere
in
the
sense
of
to
cut
or
bind
or
thresh
the
last
sheaf
hence
it
is
equivalent
to
the
phrases
you
have
the
old
man
you
are
the
old
man
which
are
addressed
to
the
cutter
binder
or
thresher
of
the
last
sheaf
therefore
when
a
stranger
as
at
brie
is
tied
up
in
a
sheaf
and
told
that
he
will
carry
the
key
of
the
field
it
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
is
the
old
man
that
is
an
embodiment
of
the
in
if
a
stranger
passes
the
he
is
seized
by
the
women
tumbled
into
the
bin
covered
with
leaves
and
not
released
till
he
has
paid
a
fine
in
some
parts
of
scotland
particularly
in
the
counties
of
fife
and
kinross
down
to
recent
times
the
reapers
used
to
seize
and
dump
as
it
was
called
any
stranger
who
happened
to
visit
or
pass
by
the
harvest
field
the
custom
was
to
lay
hold
of
the
stranger
by
his
ankles
and
armpits
lift
him
up
and
bring
the
lower
part
of
his
person
into
violent
contact
with
the
ground
women
as
well
as
men
were
liable
to
be
thus
treated
the
practice
of
interposing
a
sheaf
between
the
sufferer
and
the
ground
is
said
to
be
a
modern
refinement
comparing
this
custom
with
the
one
practised
at
putanges
in
normandy
which
has
just
been
described
we
may
conjecture
that
in
scotland
the
dumping
of
strangers
on
the
was
originally
a
preliminary
to
wrapping
them
up
in
sheaves
of
corn
ceremonies
of
a
somewhat
similar
kind
are
performed
by
the
tarahumare
indians
of
mexico
not
only
at
harvest
but
also
at
hoeing
and
ploughing
when
the
work
of
hoeing
and
weeding
is
finished
the
workers
seize
the
master
of
the
field
and
tying
his
arms
crosswise
behind
him
load
all
the
implements
that
is
to
say
the
hoes
upon
his
back
fastening
them
with
ropes
then
they
form
two
single
columns
the
landlord
in
the
middle
between
them
and
all
facing
the
house
thus
they
start
homeward
simultaneously
the
two
men
at
the
heads
of
the
columns
begin
to
run
rapidly
forward
some
thirty
yards
cross
each
other
then
turn
back
run
along
the
two
columns
cross
each
other
again
at
the
rear
and
take
their
places
each
at
the
end
of
his
row
as
they
pass
each
other
ahead
and
in
the
rear
of
the
columns
they
beat
their
mouths
with
the
hollow
of
their
hands
and
yell
as
soon
as
they
reach
their
places
at
the
foot
the
next
pair
in
front
of
the
columns
starts
off
running
in
the
same
way
and
thus
pair
after
pair
performs
the
tour
the
procession
all
the
time
advancing
toward
the
house
a
short
distance
in
front
of
it
they
come
to
a
halt
and
are
met
by
two
young
men
who
carry
red
handkerchiefs
tied
to
sticks
like
flags
the
father
of
the
family
still
tied
up
and
loaded
with
the
hoes
steps
forward
alone
and
kneels
down
in
front
of
his
the
wave
their
banners
over
him
and
the
women
of
the
household
come
out
and
kneel
on
their
left
knees
first
toward
the
east
and
after
a
little
while
toward
each
of
the
other
cardinal
points
west
south
and
north
in
conclusion
the
flags
are
waved
in
front
of
the
house
the
father
then
rises
and
the
people
untie
him
whereupon
he
first
salutes
the
women
with
the
usual
greeting
or
now
they
all
go
into
the
house
and
the
man
makes
a
short
speech
thanking
them
all
for
the
assistance
they
have
given
him
for
how
could
he
have
gotten
through
his
work
without
them
they
have
provided
him
with
a
year
s
life
that
is
with
the
wherewithal
to
sustain
it
and
now
he
is
going
to
give
them
tesvino
he
gives
a
full
to
each
one
in
the
assembly
and
appoints
one
man
among
them
to
distribute
more
to
all
the
same
ceremony
is
performed
after
the
ploughing
and
after
the
harvesting
on
the
first
occasion
the
tied
man
may
be
made
to
carry
the
yoke
of
the
oxen
on
the
second
he
does
not
carry
the
meaning
of
these
mexican
ceremonies
is
not
clear
perhaps
the
custom
of
tying
up
the
farmer
at
hoeing
ploughing
and
reaping
is
a
form
of
expiation
or
apology
offered
to
the
spirits
of
the
earth
who
are
naturally
disturbed
by
agricultural
operations
when
the
yabim
of
simbang
in
german
new
guinea
see
that
the
taro
plants
in
their
fields
are
putting
forth
leaves
they
offer
sacrifice
of
and
pork
to
the
spirits
of
the
former
owners
of
the
land
in
order
that
they
may
be
kindly
disposed
and
not
do
harm
but
let
the
fruits
ripen
similarly
when
the
alfoors
or
toradjas
of
central
celebes
are
planting
a
new
field
they
offer
rice
eggs
and
so
forth
to
the
souls
of
the
former
owners
of
the
land
hoping
that
mollified
by
these
offerings
the
souls
will
make
the
crops
to
grow
and
thrive
however
this
explanation
of
the
mexican
ceremonies
at
hoeing
ploughing
and
reaping
is
purely
conjectural
in
these
ceremonies
there
is
no
evidence
that
as
in
the
parallel
european
customs
the
farmer
is
identified
with
the
since
he
is
not
wrapt
up
in
the
sheaves
be
that
as
it
may
the
evidence
adduced
above
suffices
to
prove
that
like
the
ancient
lityerses
modern
european
reapers
have
been
wont
to
lay
hold
of
a
passing
stranger
and
tie
him
up
in
a
sheaf
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
they
should
complete
the
parallel
by
cutting
off
his
head
but
if
they
do
not
take
such
a
strong
step
their
language
and
gestures
are
at
least
indicative
of
a
desire
to
do
so
for
instance
in
mecklenburg
on
the
first
day
of
reaping
if
the
master
or
mistress
or
a
stranger
enters
the
field
or
merely
passes
by
it
all
the
mowers
face
towards
him
and
sharpen
their
scythes
clashing
their
against
them
in
unison
as
if
they
were
making
ready
to
mow
then
the
woman
who
leads
the
mowers
steps
up
to
him
and
ties
a
band
round
his
left
arm
he
must
ransom
himself
by
payment
of
a
forfeit
near
ratzeburg
when
the
master
or
other
person
of
mark
enters
the
field
or
passes
by
it
all
the
harvesters
stop
work
and
march
towards
him
in
a
body
the
men
with
their
scythes
in
front
on
meeting
him
they
form
up
in
line
men
and
women
the
men
stick
the
poles
of
their
scythes
in
the
ground
as
they
do
in
whetting
them
then
they
take
off
their
caps
and
hang
them
on
the
scythes
while
their
leader
stands
forward
and
makes
a
speech
when
he
has
done
they
all
whet
their
scythes
in
measured
time
very
loudly
after
which
they
put
on
their
caps
two
of
the
women
binders
then
come
forward
one
of
them
ties
the
master
or
stranger
as
the
case
may
be
with
or
with
a
silken
band
the
other
delivers
a
rhyming
address
the
following
are
specimens
of
the
speeches
made
by
the
reaper
on
these
occasions
in
some
parts
of
pomerania
every
is
stopped
his
way
being
barred
with
a
the
reapers
form
a
circle
round
him
and
sharpen
their
scythes
while
their
leader
says
men
are
ready
scythes
are
bent
corn
is
great
and
small
gentleman
must
be
then
the
process
of
whetting
the
scythes
is
repeated
at
ramin
in
the
district
of
stettin
the
stranger
standing
encircled
by
the
reapers
is
thus
addressed
ll
stroke
the
our
naked
sword
we
shear
meadows
and
shear
princes
and
are
often
athirst
the
gentleman
will
stand
beer
and
joke
will
soon
be
if
our
prayer
he
does
not
like
sword
has
a
right
to
that
in
these
customs
the
whetting
of
the
scythes
is
really
meant
as
a
preliminary
to
mowing
appears
from
the
following
variation
of
the
preceding
customs
in
the
district
of
lüneburg
when
any
one
enters
the
he
is
asked
whether
he
will
engage
a
good
fellow
if
he
says
yes
the
harvesters
mow
some
swaths
yelling
and
screaming
and
then
ask
him
for
on
the
strangers
are
also
regarded
as
embodiments
of
the
and
are
treated
accordingly
at
wiedingharde
in
schleswig
when
a
stranger
comes
to
the
he
is
asked
shall
i
teach
you
the
if
he
says
yes
they
put
the
arms
of
the
round
his
neck
as
if
he
were
a
sheaf
of
corn
and
press
them
together
so
tight
that
he
is
nearly
choked
in
some
parishes
of
wermland
sweden
when
a
stranger
enters
the
where
the
threshers
are
at
work
they
say
that
they
will
teach
him
the
then
they
put
a
flail
round
his
neck
and
a
straw
rope
about
his
body
also
as
we
have
seen
if
a
stranger
woman
enters
the
the
threshers
put
a
flail
round
her
body
and
a
wreath
of
round
her
neck
and
call
out
see
the
see
that
is
how
the
looks
in
these
customs
observed
both
on
the
and
on
the
a
passing
stranger
is
regarded
as
a
personification
of
the
corn
in
other
words
as
the
and
a
show
is
made
of
treating
him
like
the
corn
by
mowing
binding
and
threshing
him
if
the
reader
still
doubts
whether
european
peasants
can
really
regard
a
passing
stranger
in
this
light
the
following
custom
should
set
his
doubts
at
rest
during
the
in
the
dutch
province
of
zealand
a
stranger
passing
by
a
field
where
the
people
are
digging
the
will
sometimes
call
out
to
them
a
term
of
reproach
upon
this
two
of
the
fleetest
runners
make
after
him
and
if
they
catch
him
they
bring
him
back
to
the
and
bury
him
in
the
earth
up
to
his
middle
at
least
jeering
at
him
the
while
then
they
ease
nature
before
his
face
this
last
act
is
to
be
explained
as
follows
the
spirit
of
the
corn
and
of
other
cultivated
plants
is
sometimes
conceived
not
as
immanent
in
the
plant
but
as
its
owner
hence
the
cutting
of
the
corn
at
harvest
the
digging
of
the
roots
and
the
gathering
of
fruit
from
the
are
each
and
all
of
them
acts
of
spoliation
which
strip
him
of
his
property
and
reduce
him
to
poverty
hence
he
is
often
known
as
the
poor
man
or
the
poor
thus
in
the
neighbourhood
of
eisenach
a
small
sheaf
is
sometimes
left
standing
on
the
field
for
the
poor
old
at
marksuhl
near
eisenach
the
puppet
formed
out
of
the
last
sheaf
is
itself
called
the
poor
at
alt
lest
in
silesia
the
man
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
in
a
village
near
roeskilde
in
zealand
denmark
peasants
sometimes
make
up
the
last
sheaf
into
a
rude
puppet
which
is
called
the
in
southern
schonen
the
sheaf
which
is
bound
last
is
called
the
beggar
it
is
made
bigger
than
the
rest
and
is
sometimes
dressed
in
clothes
in
the
district
of
olmütz
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
beggar
it
is
given
to
an
old
woman
who
must
carry
it
home
limping
on
one
foot
sometimes
a
little
of
the
crop
is
left
on
the
field
for
the
spirit
under
other
names
than
the
poor
old
thus
at
szagmanten
a
village
of
the
tilsit
district
the
last
sheaf
was
left
standing
on
the
field
for
the
old
in
neftenbach
canton
of
zurich
the
first
three
ears
of
corn
reaped
are
thrown
away
on
the
field
to
satisfy
the
and
to
make
the
next
year
s
crop
at
kupferberg
in
bavaria
some
corn
is
left
standing
on
the
field
when
the
rest
has
been
cut
of
this
corn
left
standing
they
say
that
it
belongs
to
the
old
woman
to
whom
it
is
dedicated
in
the
following
words
give
it
to
the
old
woman
shall
keep
year
may
she
be
to
kind
as
this
time
she
has
these
words
clearly
shew
that
the
old
woman
for
whom
the
corn
is
left
on
the
field
is
not
a
real
personage
poor
and
hungry
but
the
mythical
old
woman
who
makes
the
corn
to
grow
at
schüttarschen
in
west
bohemia
after
the
crop
has
been
reaped
a
few
stalks
are
left
standing
and
a
garland
is
attached
to
them
that
belongs
to
the
they
say
and
offer
a
prayer
in
this
way
the
we
are
told
has
enough
to
live
on
through
the
winter
and
the
corn
will
thrive
the
better
next
year
the
same
thing
is
done
for
all
the
different
kinds
of
so
in
thüringen
when
the
is
being
got
in
a
little
heap
is
left
lying
on
the
field
it
belongs
to
the
little
in
return
for
the
blessing
she
has
bestowed
in
the
frankenwald
of
bavaria
three
handfuls
of
flax
were
left
on
the
field
for
the
at
lindau
in
anhalt
the
reapers
used
to
leave
some
stalks
standing
in
the
last
corner
of
the
last
field
for
the
to
in
some
parts
of
silesia
it
was
till
lately
the
custom
to
leave
a
few
standing
in
the
field
in
order
that
the
next
harvest
should
not
in
russia
it
is
customary
to
leave
patches
of
unreaped
corn
in
the
fields
and
to
place
bread
and
salt
on
the
ground
near
them
these
ears
are
eventually
knotted
together
and
the
ceremony
is
called
the
plaiting
of
the
beard
of
volos
and
it
is
supposed
that
after
it
has
been
performed
no
wizard
or
other
person
will
be
able
to
hurt
the
produce
of
the
fields
the
unreaped
patch
is
looked
upon
as
tabooed
and
it
is
believed
that
if
any
one
meddles
with
it
he
will
shrivel
up
and
become
twisted
like
the
interwoven
ears
similar
customs
are
kept
up
in
various
parts
of
russia
near
kursk
and
voroneje
for
instance
a
patch
of
rye
is
usually
left
in
honour
of
the
prophet
elijah
and
in
another
district
one
of
oats
is
consecrated
to
nicholas
as
it
is
well
known
that
both
the
saint
and
the
prophet
have
succeeded
to
the
place
once
held
in
the
estimation
of
the
russian
people
by
perun
it
seems
probable
that
volos
really
was
in
ancient
times
one
of
the
names
of
the
in
the
of
scotland
a
few
stalks
were
sometimes
left
unreaped
on
the
field
for
the
benefit
of
the
aul
here
the
aul
man
is
probably
the
equivalent
of
the
harvest
old
man
of
germany
among
the
mohammedans
of
zanzibar
it
is
customary
at
sowing
a
field
to
reserve
a
certain
portion
of
it
for
the
guardian
spirits
who
at
harvest
are
invited
to
the
tuck
of
drum
to
come
and
take
their
share
tiny
huts
are
also
built
in
which
food
is
deposited
for
their
use
in
the
island
of
nias
to
prevent
the
depredations
of
wandering
spirits
among
the
rice
at
harvest
a
miniature
field
is
dedicated
to
them
and
in
it
are
sown
all
the
plants
that
grow
in
the
real
fields
the
hos
a
ewe
tribe
of
negroes
in
togoland
observe
a
similar
custom
for
a
similar
reason
at
the
entrance
to
their
the
traveller
may
see
on
both
sides
of
the
path
small
mounds
on
which
yams
beans
and
maize
are
planted
and
appear
to
flourish
with
more
than
usual
luxuriance
these
little
gardens
tended
with
peculiar
care
are
dedicated
to
the
guardian
gods
of
the
owner
of
the
land
there
he
cultivates
for
their
benefit
the
same
plants
which
he
cultivates
for
his
own
use
in
the
fields
and
the
notion
is
that
the
guardian
gods
will
content
themselves
with
eating
the
fruits
which
grow
in
their
little
private
preserves
and
will
not
poach
on
the
crops
which
are
destined
for
human
use
these
customs
suggest
that
the
little
sacred
on
which
the
kayans
of
borneo
perform
the
various
operations
of
husbandry
in
mimicry
before
they
address
themselves
to
the
real
labours
of
the
field
may
be
dedicated
to
the
spirits
of
the
rice
to
compensate
them
for
the
loss
they
sustain
by
allowing
men
to
cultivate
all
the
rest
of
the
land
for
their
own
benefit
perhaps
the
rarian
plain
at
eleusis
was
a
spiritual
preserve
of
the
same
kind
set
apart
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
demeter
and
persephone
it
may
even
be
that
the
law
which
forbade
the
hebrews
to
reap
the
corners
and
gather
the
gleanings
of
the
and
to
strip
the
vines
of
their
last
grapes
was
originally
intended
for
the
benefit
not
of
the
human
poor
but
of
the
poor
spirits
of
the
corn
and
the
vine
who
had
just
been
despoiled
by
the
reapers
and
the
vintagers
and
who
if
some
provision
were
not
made
for
their
subsistence
would
naturally
die
of
hunger
before
another
year
came
round
in
providing
for
their
wants
the
prudent
husbandman
was
really
consulting
his
own
interests
for
how
could
he
expect
to
reap
wheat
and
barley
and
to
gather
grapes
next
year
if
he
suffered
the
spirits
of
the
corn
and
of
the
vine
to
perish
of
famine
in
the
meantime
this
train
of
thought
may
possibly
explain
the
custom
of
offering
the
of
the
crops
to
gods
or
spirits
such
offerings
may
have
been
originally
not
so
much
an
expression
of
gratitude
for
benefits
received
as
a
means
of
enabling
the
benefactors
to
continue
their
benefactions
in
time
to
come
primitive
man
has
generally
a
shrewd
eye
to
the
main
chance
he
is
more
prone
to
provide
for
the
future
than
to
sentimentalise
over
the
past
thus
when
the
spirit
of
vegetation
is
conceived
as
a
being
who
is
robbed
of
his
store
and
impoverished
by
the
harvesters
it
is
natural
that
his
passing
upbraid
them
and
it
is
equally
natural
that
they
should
seek
to
disable
him
from
pursuing
them
and
recapturing
the
stolen
property
now
it
is
an
old
superstition
that
by
easing
nature
on
the
spot
where
a
robbery
is
committed
the
robbers
secure
themselves
for
a
certain
time
against
interruption
hence
when
resort
to
this
proceeding
in
presence
of
the
stranger
whom
they
have
caught
and
buried
in
the
field
we
may
infer
that
they
consider
themselves
robbers
and
him
as
the
person
robbed
regarded
as
such
he
must
be
the
natural
owner
of
the
that
is
their
spirit
or
demon
and
this
conception
is
carried
out
by
burying
him
like
the
in
the
ground
the
greeks
it
may
be
observed
were
quite
familiar
with
the
idea
that
a
passing
stranger
may
be
a
god
homer
says
that
the
gods
in
the
likeness
of
foreigners
roam
up
and
down
cities
once
in
poso
a
district
of
celebes
when
a
new
missionary
entered
a
house
where
a
number
of
people
were
gathered
round
a
sick
man
one
of
them
addressed
the
newcomer
in
these
words
well
sir
as
we
had
never
seen
you
before
and
you
came
suddenly
in
while
we
sat
here
by
ourselves
we
thought
it
was
a
thus
in
these
of
modern
europe
the
person
who
cuts
binds
or
threshes
the
last
corn
is
treated
as
an
embodiment
of
the
by
being
wrapt
up
in
sheaves
killed
in
mimicry
by
agricultural
implements
and
thrown
into
the
water
these
coincidences
with
the
lityerses
story
seem
to
prove
that
the
latter
is
a
genuine
description
of
an
old
phrygian
but
since
in
the
modern
parallels
the
killing
of
the
personal
representative
of
the
is
necessarily
omitted
or
at
most
enacted
only
in
mimicry
it
is
desirable
to
shew
that
in
rude
society
human
beings
have
been
commonly
killed
as
an
agricultural
ceremony
to
promote
the
fertility
of
the
fields
the
following
examples
will
make
this
plain
human
sacrifices
for
the
crops
the
indians
of
guayaquil
in
ecuador
used
to
sacrifice
human
blood
and
the
hearts
of
men
when
they
sowed
their
fields
the
people
of
cañar
now
cuenca
in
ecuador
used
to
sacrifice
a
hundred
children
annually
at
harvest
the
kings
of
quito
the
incas
of
peru
and
for
a
long
time
the
spaniards
were
unable
to
suppress
the
bloody
rite
at
a
mexican
when
the
of
the
season
were
offered
to
the
sun
a
criminal
was
placed
between
two
immense
stones
balanced
opposite
each
other
and
was
crushed
by
them
as
they
fell
together
his
remains
were
buried
and
a
feast
and
dance
followed
this
sacrifice
was
known
as
the
meeting
of
the
tlaloc
was
worshipped
in
mexico
as
the
god
of
the
thunder
and
the
storm
which
precedes
the
fertilising
rain
elsewhere
his
wife
xochiquetzal
who
at
tlaxcallan
was
called
matlalcuéyé
or
the
lady
of
the
blue
petticoats
shared
these
honours
and
it
was
to
her
that
many
countries
in
central
america
particularly
paid
their
devotions
every
year
at
the
time
when
the
cobs
of
the
still
green
and
milky
maize
are
about
to
coagulate
and
ripen
they
used
to
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
four
young
girls
chosen
among
the
noblest
families
of
the
country
they
were
decked
out
in
festal
attire
crowned
with
flowers
and
conveyed
in
rich
palanquins
to
the
brink
of
the
hallowed
waters
where
the
sacrifice
was
to
be
offered
the
priests
clad
in
long
floating
robes
their
heads
encircled
with
feather
crowns
marched
in
front
of
the
litters
carrying
censers
with
burning
incense
the
town
of
elopango
celebrated
for
its
temple
was
near
the
lake
of
the
same
name
the
etymology
of
which
refers
to
the
sheaves
of
tender
maize
sheaf
of
tender
maize
it
was
dedicated
to
the
goddess
xochiquetzal
to
whom
the
young
victims
were
offered
by
being
hurled
from
the
top
of
a
rock
into
the
abyss
at
the
moment
of
consummating
this
inhuman
rite
the
priests
addressed
themselves
in
turn
to
the
four
virgins
in
order
to
banish
the
fear
of
death
from
their
minds
they
drew
for
them
a
bright
picture
of
the
delights
they
were
about
to
enjoy
in
the
company
of
the
gods
and
advised
them
not
to
forget
the
earth
which
they
had
left
behind
but
to
entreat
the
divinity
to
whom
they
despatched
them
to
bless
the
forthcoming
we
have
seen
that
the
ancient
mexicans
also
sacrificed
human
beings
at
all
the
various
stages
in
the
growth
of
the
maize
the
age
of
the
victims
corresponding
to
the
age
of
the
corn
for
they
sacrificed
babes
at
sowing
older
children
when
the
grain
had
sprouted
and
so
on
till
it
was
fully
ripe
when
they
sacrificed
old
men
no
doubt
the
correspondence
between
the
ages
of
the
victims
and
the
state
of
the
corn
was
supposed
to
enhance
the
efficacy
of
the
sacrifice
the
pawnees
annually
sacrificed
a
human
victim
in
spring
when
they
sowed
their
fields
the
sacrifice
was
believed
to
have
been
enjoined
on
them
by
the
morning
star
or
by
a
certain
bird
which
the
morning
star
had
sent
to
them
as
its
messenger
the
bird
was
stuffed
and
preserved
as
a
powerful
talisman
they
thought
that
an
omission
of
this
sacrifice
would
be
followed
by
the
total
failure
of
the
crops
of
maize
beans
and
pumpkins
the
victim
was
a
captive
of
either
sex
he
was
clad
in
the
gayest
and
most
costly
attire
was
fattened
on
the
choicest
food
and
carefully
kept
in
ignorance
of
his
doom
when
he
was
fat
enough
they
bound
him
to
a
cross
in
the
presence
of
the
multitude
danced
a
solemn
dance
then
cleft
his
head
with
a
tomahawk
and
shot
him
with
arrows
according
to
one
trader
the
squaws
then
cut
pieces
of
flesh
from
the
victim
s
body
with
which
they
greased
their
hoes
but
this
was
denied
by
another
trader
who
had
been
present
at
the
ceremony
immediately
after
the
sacrifice
the
people
proceeded
to
plant
their
fields
a
particular
account
has
been
preserved
of
the
sacrifice
of
a
sioux
girl
by
the
pawnees
in
april
or
the
girl
was
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
and
had
been
kept
for
six
months
and
well
treated
two
days
before
the
sacrifice
she
was
led
from
wigwam
to
wigwam
accompanied
by
the
whole
council
of
chiefs
and
warriors
at
each
lodge
she
received
a
small
billet
of
wood
and
a
little
paint
which
she
handed
to
the
warrior
next
to
her
in
this
way
she
called
at
every
wigwam
receiving
at
each
the
same
present
of
wood
and
paint
on
the
of
april
she
was
taken
out
to
be
sacrificed
attended
by
the
warriors
each
of
whom
carried
two
pieces
of
wood
which
he
had
received
from
her
hands
her
body
having
been
painted
half
red
and
half
black
she
was
attached
to
a
sort
of
gibbet
and
roasted
for
some
time
over
a
slow
fire
then
shot
to
death
with
arrows
the
chief
sacrificer
next
tore
out
her
heart
and
devoured
it
while
her
flesh
was
still
warm
it
was
cut
in
small
pieces
from
the
bones
put
in
little
baskets
and
taken
to
a
neighbouring
there
the
head
chief
took
a
piece
of
the
flesh
from
a
basket
and
squeezed
a
drop
of
blood
upon
the
grains
of
corn
his
example
was
followed
by
the
rest
till
all
the
seed
had
been
sprinkled
with
the
blood
it
was
then
covered
up
with
earth
according
to
one
account
the
body
of
the
victim
was
reduced
to
a
kind
of
paste
which
was
rubbed
or
sprinkled
not
only
on
the
maize
but
also
on
the
potatoes
the
beans
and
other
seeds
to
fertilise
them
by
this
sacrifice
they
hoped
to
obtain
plentiful
crops
a
west
african
queen
used
to
sacrifice
a
man
and
woman
in
the
month
of
march
they
were
killed
with
spades
and
hoes
and
their
bodies
buried
in
the
middle
of
a
field
which
had
just
been
tilled
at
lagos
in
guinea
it
was
the
custom
annually
to
impale
a
young
girl
alive
soon
after
the
spring
equinox
in
order
to
secure
good
crops
along
with
her
were
sacrificed
sheep
and
goats
which
with
yams
heads
of
maize
and
plantains
were
hung
on
stakes
on
each
side
of
her
the
victims
were
bred
up
for
the
purpose
in
the
king
s
seraglio
and
their
minds
had
been
so
powerfully
wrought
upon
by
the
fetish
men
that
they
went
cheerfully
to
their
fate
a
similar
sacrifice
used
to
be
annually
offered
at
benin
in
guinea
the
marimos
a
bechuana
tribe
sacrifice
a
human
being
for
the
crops
the
victim
chosen
is
generally
a
short
stout
man
he
is
seized
by
violence
or
intoxicated
and
taken
to
the
fields
where
he
is
killed
amongst
the
wheat
to
serve
as
seed
so
they
phrase
it
after
his
blood
has
coagulated
in
the
sun
it
is
burned
along
with
the
frontal
bone
the
flesh
attached
to
it
and
the
brain
the
ashes
are
then
scattered
over
the
ground
to
fertilise
it
the
rest
of
the
body
is
eaten
the
wamegi
of
the
usagara
hills
in
german
east
africa
used
to
offer
human
sacrifices
of
a
peculiar
kind
once
a
year
about
the
time
of
harvest
which
was
also
the
time
of
sowing
for
the
wamegi
have
two
crops
annually
one
in
september
and
one
in
february
the
festival
was
usually
held
in
september
or
october
the
victim
was
a
girl
who
had
attained
the
age
of
puberty
she
was
taken
to
a
hill
where
the
festival
was
to
be
celebrated
and
there
she
was
crushed
to
death
between
two
branches
the
sacrifice
was
not
performed
in
the
fields
and
my
informant
could
not
ascertain
its
object
but
we
may
conjecture
that
it
was
to
ensure
good
crops
in
the
following
year
the
bagobos
of
mindanao
one
of
the
philippine
islands
offer
a
human
sacrifice
before
they
sow
their
rice
the
victim
is
a
slave
who
is
hewn
to
pieces
in
the
forest
the
natives
of
bontoc
a
province
in
the
interior
of
luzon
one
of
the
philippine
islands
are
passionate
their
principal
seasons
for
are
the
times
of
planting
and
reaping
the
rice
in
order
that
the
crop
may
turn
out
well
every
farm
must
get
at
least
one
human
head
at
planting
and
one
at
sowing
the
go
out
in
twos
or
threes
lie
in
wait
for
the
victim
whether
man
or
woman
cut
off
his
or
her
head
hands
and
feet
and
bring
them
back
in
haste
to
the
village
where
they
are
received
with
great
rejoicings
the
skulls
are
at
first
exposed
on
the
branches
of
two
or
three
dead
trees
which
stand
in
an
open
space
of
every
village
surrounded
by
large
stones
which
serve
as
seats
the
people
then
dance
round
them
and
feast
and
get
drunk
when
the
flesh
has
decayed
from
the
head
the
man
who
cut
it
off
takes
it
home
and
preserves
it
as
a
relic
while
his
companions
do
the
same
with
the
hands
and
the
feet
similar
customs
are
observed
by
the
apoyaos
another

in
the
interior
of
luzon
the

for

the

regards
his

as
a
protection
against
the
powers
of
evil
without
a

his
crops
would
fail
without
a
skull
his
kine
might
die
without
a
skull
the
father
and
mother
spirits
would
be
shamed
and
might
be
enraged
if
there
were
no
protecting
skull
the
other
spirits
who
are
all
malignant
might
gain
entrance
and
kill
the
inhabitants
or

all

the
wa
country
is
a
series
of
mountain
ranges
shelving
rapidly
down
to
narrow
valleys
from
two
to
five
thousand
feet
deep
the
villages
are
all
perched
high
on
the
slopes
some
just
under
the
crest
of
the
ridge
some
lower
down
on
a
small
projecting
spur
of
flat
ground
industrious
cultivation
has
cleared
away
the
jungle
and
the
villages
stand
out
conspicuously
in
the
landscape
as
blotches
on
the
hillsides
each
village
is
fortified
by
an
earthen
rampart
so
thickly
overgrown
with
cactuses
and
other
shrubs
as
to
be
impenetrable
the
only
entrance
is
through
a
narrow
low
and
winding
tunnel
the
floor
of
which
for
additional
security
is
thickly
studded
with
pegs
to
wound
the
feet
of
enemies
who
might
attempt
to
force
a
way
in
the
wa
depend
for
their
subsistence
mainly
on
their
crops
of
buckwheat
beans
and
maize
rice
they
cultivate
only
to
distil
a
strong
spirituous
liquor
from
it
they
had
need
be
industrious
for
no
field
can
be
reached
without
a
climb
up
or
down
the
steep
sometimes
the
lie
three
thousand
feet
or
more
below
the
village
and
they
require
constant
attention
but
the
chief
crop
raised
by
the
wa
is
the
poppy
from
which
they
make
opium
in

march
the
for

are
white
with
the
blossom
and
you
may
travel
for

through
nothing
but
fields
of

then

is
the
proper
season
for
it
opens
in
march
and
lasts
through
april
parties
of
at
that
time
go
forth
to
prowl
for
human
prey
as
a
rule
they
will
not
behead
people
of
a
neighbouring
village
nor
even
of
any
village
on
the
same
range
of
hills
to
find
victims
they
go
to
the
next
range
or
at
any
rate
to
a
distance
and
the
farther
the
better
for
the
heads
of
strangers
are
preferred
the
reason
is
that
the
ghosts
of
strangers
being
unfamiliar
with
the
country
are
much
less
likely
to
stray
away
from
their
skulls
hence
they
make
more
vigilant
sentinels
than
the
ghosts
of
people
better
acquainted
with
the
neighbourhood
who
are
apt
to
go
off
duty
without
waiting
for
the
tedious
formality
of
relieving
guard
when
return
to
a
village
with
human
heads
the
rejoicing
is
uproarious
then
the
great
drum
is
beaten
frantically
and
its
deep
hollow
boom
resounding
far
and
wide
through
the
hills
announces
to
the
neighbourhood
the
glad
tidings
of
murder
successfully
perpetrated
then
the
barrels
or
rather
the
bamboos
of
are
tapped
and
while
the
genial
stream
flows
and
the
women
and
children
dance
and
sing
for
glee
the
men
drink
themselves
blind
and
mad
drunk
the
ghastly
head
which
forms
the
centre
of
all
this
rejoicing
is
first
taken
to
the
a
small
shed
which
usually
stands
on
the
highest
point
of
the
village
site
there
wrapt
in
grass
or
leaves
it
is
hung
up
in
a
basket
to
ripen
and
bleach
when
all
the
flesh
and
sinews
have
mouldered
away
and
nothing
remains
but
the
blanched
and
grinning
skull
it
is
put
to
rest
in
the
village
golgotha
this
is
an
avenue
of
huge
old
trees
whose
interlacing
boughs
form
a
verdant
archway
overhead
and
with
the
dense
undergrowth
cast
a
deep
shadow
on
the
ground
below
every
village
has
such
an
avenue
stretching
along
the
hillside
sometimes
for
a
long
distance
or
even
till
it
meets
the
avenue
of
the
neighbouring
village
in
the
solemn
gloom
of
this
verdurous
canopy
is
the
place
of

on
one
side
of
the
avenue
stands
a
row
of
wooden
posts
usually
mere
trunks
of
trees
with
the
bark
peeled
off
but
sometimes
rudely
carved
and
painted
with
designs
in
red
and
black
a

below
the

is
cut
a

some
of

when

human
sacrifice
to
procure

though
they
act
on
the
belief
less
than
some
other
tribes
of
this
region
their
practice
now
is
to
poison
somebody
at
the
state
festival
which
is
generally
held
at
some
time
between
march
and
may
among
the
lhota
naga
one
of
the
many
savage
tribes
who
inhabit
the
deep
rugged
labyrinthine
glens
which
wind
into
the
mountains
from
the
rich
valley
of
brahmapootra
it
used
to
be
a
common
custom
to
chop
off
the
heads
hands
and
feet
of
people
they
met
with
and
then
to
stick
up
the
severed
extremities
in
their
fields
to
ensure
a
good
crop
of
grain
they
bore
no
whatever
to
the
persons
upon
whom
they
operated
in
this
unceremonious
fashion
once
they
flayed
a
boy
alive
carved
him
in
pieces
and
distributed
the
flesh
among
all
the
villagers
who
put
it
into
their
to
avert
bad
luck
and
ensure
plentiful
crops
of
grain
the
angami
another
tribe
of
the
same
region
used
also
to
relieve
casual
of
their
heads
hands
and
feet
with
the
same
excellent
intention
the
hill
tribe
kudulu
near
vizagapatam
in
the
madras
presidency
offered
human
sacrifices
to
the
god
jankari
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
good
crops
the
ceremony
was
generally
performed
on
the
sunday
before
or
after
the
pongal
feast
for
the
most
part
the
victim
was
purchased
and
until
the
time
for
the
sacrifice
came
he
was
free
to
wander
about
the
village
to
eat
and
drink
what
he
liked
and
even
to
lie
with
any
woman
he
met
on
the
appointed
day
he
was
carried
before
the
idol
drunk
and
when
one
of
the
villagers
had
cut
a
hole
in
his
stomach
and
smeared
the
blood
on
the
idol
the
crowds
from
the
neighbouring
villages
rushed
upon
him
and
hacked
him
to
pieces
all
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
secure
morsels
of
his
flesh
carried
them
away
and
presented
them
to
their
village
idols
the
gonds
of
india
a
dravidian
race
kidnapped
brahman
boys
and
kept
them
as
victims
to
be
sacrificed
on
various
occasions
at
sowing
and
reaping
after
a
triumphal
procession
one
of
the
lads
was
slain
by
being
punctured
with
a
poisoned
arrow
his
blood
was
then
sprinkled
over
the
ploughed
field
or
the
ripe
crop
and
his
flesh
was
devoured

of
chota
nagpur
worship
a
goddess
called
anna
kuari
who
can
give
good
crops
and
make
a
man
rich
but
to
induce
her
to
do
so
it
is
necessary
to
offer
human
sacrifices
in
spite
of
the
vigilance
of
the
british
government
these
sacrifices
are
said
to
be
still
secretly
perpetrated
the
victims
are
poor
waifs
and
strays
whose
disappearance
attracts
no
notice
april
and
may
are
the
months
when
the
catchpoles
are
out
on
the
prowl
at
that
time
strangers
will
not
go
about
the
country
alone
and
parents
will
not
let
their
children
enter
the
jungle
or
herd
the
cattle
when
a
catchpole
has
found
a
victim
he
cuts
his
throat
and
carries
away
the
upper
part
of
the
ring
finger
and
the
nose
the
goddess
takes
up
her
abode
in
the
house
of
any
man
who
has
offered
her
a
sacrifice
and
from
that
time
his
fields
yield
a
double
harvest
the
form
she
assumes
in
the
house
is
that
of
a
small
child
when
the
householder
brings
in
his
unhusked
rice
he
takes
the
goddess
and
rolls
her
over
the
heap
to
double
its
size
but
she
soon
grows
restless
and
can
only
be
pacified
with
the
blood
of
fresh
human
victims
but
the
best
known
case
of
human
sacrifices
systematically
offered
to
ensure
good
crops
is
supplied
by
the
khonds
or
kandhs
another
dravidian
race
in
bengal
our
knowledge
of
them
is
derived
from
the
accounts
written
by
british
officers
who
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
engaged
in
putting
them
down
the
sacrifices
were
offered
to
the
earth
goddess
tari
pennu
or
bera
pennu
and
were
believed
to
ensure
good
crops
and
immunity
from
all
disease
and
accidents
in
particular
they
were
considered
necessary
in
the
cultivation
of
turmeric
the
khonds
arguing
that
the
turmeric
could
not
have
a
deep
red
colour
without
the
shedding
of
blood
the
victim
or
meriah
as
he
was
called
was
acceptable
to
the
goddess
only
if
he
had
been
purchased
or
had
been
born
a
is
the
son
of
a
victim
father
or
had
been
devoted
as
a
child
by
his
father
or
guardian
khonds
in
distress
often
sold
their
children
for
victims
considering
the
beatification
of
their
souls
certain
and
their
death
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
the
most
honourable
a
man
of
the
panua
tribe
was
once
seen
to
load
a
khond
with
curses
and
finally
to
spit
in
his
face
because
the
khond
had
sold
for
a
victim
his
own
child
whom
the
panua
had
wished
to
marry
a
party
of
khonds
who
saw
this
immediately
pressed
forward
to
comfort
the
seller
of
his
child
saying
your
child
has
died
that
all
the
world
may
live
and
the
earth
goddess
herself
will
wipe
that
spittle
from
your
the
victims
were
often
kept
for
years
before
they
were
sacrificed
being
regarded
as
consecrated
beings
they
were
treated
with
extreme
affection
mingled
with
deference
and
were
welcomed
wherever
they
went
a
meriah
youth
on
attaining
maturity
was
generally
given
a
wife
who
was
herself
usually
a
meriah
or
victim
and
with
her
he
received
a
portion
of
land
and
their
offspring
were
also
victims
human
sacrifices
were
offered
to
the
earth
goddess
by
tribes
branches
of
tribes
or
villages
both
at
periodical
festivals
and
on
extraordinary
occasions
the
periodical
sacrifices
were
generally
so
arranged
by
tribes
and
divisions
of
tribes
that
each
head
of
a
family
was
enabled
at
least
once
a
year
to
procure
a
shred
of
flesh
for
his
fields
generally
about
the
time
when
his
chief
crop
was
laid
down
the
mode
of
performing
these
tribal
sacrifices
was
as
follows
ten
or
twelve
days
before
the
sacrifice
the
victim
was
devoted
by
cutting
off
his
hair
which
until
then
had
been
kept
unshorn
crowds
of
men
and
women
assembled
to
witness
the
sacrifice
none
might
be
excluded
since
the
sacrifice
was
declared
to
be
for
all
mankind
it
was
preceded
by
several
days
of
wild
revelry
and
gross
debauchery
on
the
day
before
the
sacrifice
the
victim
dressed
in
a
new
garment
was
led
forth
from
the
village
in
solemn
procession
with
music
and
dancing
to
the
meriah
grove
a
clump
of
high
forest
trees
standing
a
little
way
from
the
village
and
untouched
by
the
axe
there
they
tied
him
to
a
post
which
was
sometimes
placed
between
two
plants
of
the
sankissar
shrub
he
was
then
anointed
with
oil
ghee
and
turmeric
and
adorned
with
flowers
and
a
species
of
reverence
which
it
is
not
easy
to
distinguish
from
adoration
was
paid
to
him
throughout
the
day
a
great
struggle
now
arose
to
obtain
the
smallest
relic
from
his
person
a
particle
of
the
turmeric
paste
with
which
he
was
smeared
or
a
drop
of
his
spittle
was
esteemed
of
sovereign
virtue
especially
by
the
women
the
crowd
danced
round
the
post
to
music
and
addressing
the
earth
said
o
god
we
offer
this
sacrifice
to
you
give
us
good
crops
seasons
and
health
then
speaking
to
the
victim
they
said
we
bought
you
with
a
price
and
did
not
seize
you
now
we
sacrifice
you
according
to
custom
and
no
sin
rests
with
on
the
last
morning
the
orgies
which
had
been
scarcely
interrupted
during
the
night
were
resumed
and
continued
till
noon
when
they
ceased
and
the
assembly
proceeded
to
consummate
the
sacrifice
the
victim
was
again
anointed
with
oil
and
each
person
touched
the
anointed
part
and
wiped
the
oil
on
his
own
head
in
some
places
they
took
the
victim
in
procession
round
the
village
from
door
to
door
where
some
plucked
hair
from
his
head
and
others
begged
for
a
drop
of
his
spittle
with
which
they
anointed
their
heads
as
the
victim
might
not
be
bound
nor
make
any
show
of
resistance
the
bones
of
his
arms
and
if
necessary
his
legs
were
broken
but
often
this
precaution
was
rendered
unnecessary
by
stupefying
him
with
opium
the
mode
of
putting
him
to
death
varied
in
different
places
one
of
the
commonest
modes
seems
to
have
been
strangulation
or
squeezing
to
death
the
branch
of
a
green
tree
was
cleft
several
feet
down
the
middle
the
victim
s
neck
in
other
places
his
chest
was
inserted
in
the
cleft
which
the
priest
aided
by
his
assistants
strove
with
all
his
force
to
close
then
he
wounded
the
victim
slightly
with
his
axe
whereupon
the
crowd
rushed
at
the
wretch
and
hewed
the
flesh
from
the
bones
leaving
the
head
and
bowels
untouched
sometimes
he
was
cut
up
alive
in
chinna
kimedy
he
was
dragged
along
the
fields
surrounded
by
the
crowd
who
avoiding
his
head
and
intestines
hacked
the
flesh
from
his
body
with
their
knives
till
he
died
another
very
common
mode
of
sacrifice
in
the
same
district
was
to
fasten
the
victim
to
the
proboscis
of
a
wooden
elephant
which
revolved
on
a
stout
post
and
as
it
whirled
round
the
crowd
cut
the
flesh
from
the
victim
while
life
remained
in
some
villages
major
campbell
found
as
many
as
fourteen
of
these
wooden
elephants
which
had
been
used
at
sacrifices
in
one
district
the
victim
was
put
to
death
slowly
by
fire
a
low
stage
was
formed
sloping
on
either
side
like
a
roof
upon
it
they
laid
the
victim
his
limbs
wound
round
with
cords
to
confine
his
struggles
fires
were
then
lighted
and
hot
brands
applied
to
make
him
roll
up
and
down
the
slopes
of
the
stage
as
long
as
possible
for
the
more
tears
he
shed
the
more
abundant
would
be
the
supply
of
rain
next
day
the
body
was
cut
to
pieces
the
flesh
cut
from
the
victim
was
instantly
taken
home
by
the
persons
who
had
been
deputed
by
each
village
to
bring
it
to
secure
its
rapid
arrival
it
was
sometimes
forwarded
by
relays
of
men
and
conveyed
with
postal
fleetness
fifty
or
sixty
miles
in
each
village
all
who
stayed
at
home
fasted
rigidly
until
the
flesh
arrived
the
bearer
deposited
it
in
the
place
of
public
assembly
where
it
was
received
by
the
priest
and
the
heads
of
families
the
priest
divided
it
into
two
portions
one
of
which
he
offered
to
the
earth
goddess
by
burying
it
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
with
his
back
turned
and
without
looking
then
each
man
added
a
little
earth
to
bury
it
and
the
priest
poured
water
on
the
spot
from
a
hill
gourd
the
other
portion
of
flesh
he
divided
into
as
many
shares
as
there
were
heads
of
houses
present
each
head
of
a
house
rolled
his
shred
of
flesh
in
leaves
and
buried
it
in
his
favourite
field
placing
it
in
the
earth
behind
his
back
without
looking
in
some
places
each
man
carried
his
portion
of
flesh
to
the
stream
which
watered
his
fields
and
there
hung
it
on
a
pole
for
three
days
thereafter
no
house
was
swept
and
in
one
district
strict
silence
was
observed
no
fire
might
be
given
out
no
wood
cut
and
no
strangers
received
the
remains
of
the
human
victim
namely
the
head
bowels
and
bones
were
watched
by
strong
parties
the
night
after
the
sacrifice
and
next
morning
they
were
burned
along
with
a
whole
sheep
on
a
funeral
pile
the
ashes
were
scattered
over
the
fields
laid
as
paste
over
the
houses
and
granaries
or
mixed
with
the
new
corn
to
preserve
it
from
insects
sometimes
however
the
head
and
bones
were
buried
not
burnt
after
the
suppression
of
the
human
sacrifices
inferior
victims
were
substituted
in
some
places
for
instance
in
the
capital
of
chinna
kimedy
a
goat
took
the
place
of
a
human
victim
others
sacrifice
a
buffalo
they
tie
it
to
a
wooden
post
in
a
sacred
grove
dance
wildly
round
it
with
brandished
knives
then
falling
on
the
living
animal
hack
it
to
shreds
and
tatters
in
a
few
minutes
fighting
and
struggling
with
each
other
for
every
particle
of
flesh
as
soon
as
a
man
has
secured
a
piece
he
makes
off
with
it
at
full
speed
to
bury
it
in
his
fields
according
to
ancient
custom
before
the
sun
has
set
and
as
some
of
them
have
far
to
go
they
must
run
very
fast
all
the
women
throw
clods
of
earth
at
the
rapidly
retreating
figures
of
the
men
some
of
them
taking
very
good
aim
soon
the
sacred
grove
so
lately
a
scene
of
tumult
is
silent
and
deserted
except
for
a
few
people
who
remain
to
guard
all
that
is
left
of
the
buffalo
to
wit
the
head
the
bones
and
the
stomach
which
are
burned
with
ceremony
at
the
foot
of
the
stake
in
these
khond
sacrifices
the
meriahs
are
represented
by
our
authorities
as
victims
offered
to
propitiate
the
earth
goddess
but
from
the
treatment
of
the
victims
both
before
and
after
death
it
appears
that
the
custom
can
not
be
explained
as
merely
a
propitiatory
sacrifice
a
part
of
the
flesh
certainly
was
offered
to
the
earth
goddess
but
the
rest
was
buried
by
each
householder
in
his
fields
and
the
ashes
of
the
other
parts
of
the
body
were
scattered
over
the
fields
laid
as
paste
on
the
granaries
or
mixed
with
the
new
corn
these
latter
customs
imply
that
to
the
body
of
the
meriah
there
was
ascribed
a
direct
or
intrinsic
power
of
making
the
crops
to
grow
quite
independent
of
the
indirect
efficacy
which
it
might
have
as
an
offering
to
secure
the
of
the
deity
in
other
words
the
flesh
and
ashes
of
the
victim
were
believed
to
be
endowed
with
a
magical
or
physical
power
of
fertilising
the
land
the
same
intrinsic
power
was
ascribed
to
the
blood
and
tears
of
the
meriah
his
blood
causing
the
redness
of
the
turmeric
and
his
tears
producing
rain
for
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
originally
at
least
the
tears
were
supposed
to
bring
down
the
rain
not
merely
to
prognosticate
it
similarly
the
custom
of
pouring
water
on
the
buried
flesh
of
the
meriah
was
no
doubt
a
again
magical
power
as
an
attribute
of
the
meriah
appears
in
the
sovereign
virtue
believed
to
reside
in
anything
that
came
from
his
person
as
his
hair
or
spittle
the
ascription
of
such
power
to
the
meriah
indicates
that
he
was
much
more
than
a
mere
man
sacrificed
to
propitiate
a
deity
once
more
the
extreme
reverence
paid
him
points
to
the
same
conclusion
major
campbell
speaks
of
the
meriah
as
being
regarded
as
something
more
than
mortal
and
major
macpherson
says
a
species
of
reverence
which
it
is
not
easy
to
distinguish
from
adoration
is
paid
to
in
short
the
meriah
seems
to
have
been
regarded
as
divine
as
such
he
may
originally
have
represented
the
earth
goddess
or
perhaps
a
deity
of
vegetation
though
in
later
times
he
came
to
be
regarded
rather
as
a
victim
offered
to
a
deity
than
as
himself
an
incarnate
god
this
later
view
of
the
meriah
as
a
victim
rather
than
a
divinity
may
perhaps
have
received
undue
emphasis
from
the
european
writers
who
have
described
the
khond
religion
habituated
to
the
later
idea
of
sacrifice
as
an
offering
made
to
a
god
for
the
purpose
of
conciliating
his
favour
european
observers
are
apt
to
interpret
all
religious
slaughter
in
this
sense
and
to
suppose
that
wherever
such
slaughter
takes
place
there
must
necessarily
be
a
deity
to
whom
the
carnage
is
believed
by
the
slayers
to
be
acceptable
thus
their
preconceived
ideas
may
unconsciously
colour
and
warp
their
descriptions
of
savage
rites
the
same
custom
of
killing
the
representative
of
a
god
of
which
strong
traces
appear
in
the
khond
sacrifices
may
perhaps
be
detected
in
some
of
the
other
human
sacrifices
described
above
thus
the
ashes
of
the
slaughtered
marimo
were
scattered
over
the
fields
the
blood
of
the
brahman
lad
was
put
on
the
crop
and
field
the
flesh
of
the
slain
naga
was
stowed
in
the
and
the
blood
of
the
sioux
girl
was
allowed
to
trickle
on
the
seed
again
the
identification
of
the
victim
with
the
corn
in
other
words
the
view
that
he
is
an
embodiment
or
spirit
of
the
corn
is
brought
out
in
the
pains
which
seem
to
be
taken
to
secure
a
physical
correspondence
between
him
and
the
natural
object
which
he
embodies
or
represents
thus
the
mexicans
killed
young
victims
for
the
young
corn
and
old
ones
for
the
ripe
corn
the
marimos
sacrifice
as
seed
a
short
fat
man
the
shortness
of
his
stature
corresponding
to
that
of
the
young
corn
his
fatness
to
the
condition
which
it
is
desired
that
the
crops
may
attain
and
the
pawnees
fattened
their
victims
probably
with
the
same
view
again
the
identification
of
the
victim
with
the
corn
comes
out
in
the
african
custom
of
killing
him
with
spades
and
hoes
and
the
mexican
custom
of
grinding
him
like
corn
between
two
stones
one
more
point
in
these
savage
customs
deserves
to
be
noted
the
pawnee
chief
devoured
the
heart
of
the
sioux
girl
and
the
marimos
and
gonds
ate
the
victim
s
flesh
if
as
we
suppose
the
victim
was
regarded
as
divine
it
follows
that
in
eating
his
flesh
his
worshippers
believed
themselves
to
be
partaking
of
the
body
of
their
god
the
slain
in
his
human
representatives
the
barbarous
rites
just
described
offer
analogies
to
the
harvest
customs
of
europe
thus
the
fertilising
virtue
ascribed
to
the
is
shewn
equally
in
the
savage
custom
of
mixing
the
victim
s
blood
or
ashes
with
the
and
the
european
custom
of
mixing
the
grain
from
the
last
sheaf
with
the
young
corn
in
spring
again
the
identification
of
the
person
with
the
corn
appears
alike
in
the
savage
custom
of
adapting
the
age
and
stature
of
the
victim
to
the
age
and
stature
whether
actual
or
expected
of
the
crop
in
the
scotch
and
styrian
rules
that
when
the
is
conceived
as
the
maiden
the
last
corn
shall
be
cut
by
a
young
maiden
but
when
it
is
conceived
as
the
it
shall
be
cut
by
an
old
woman
in
the
lothringian
warning
given
to
old
women
to
save
themselves
when
the
old
woman
is
being
killed
that
is
when
the
last
corn
is
being
threshed
and
in
the
tyrolese
expectation
that
if
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
tall
the
next
year
s
corn
will
be
tall
also
further
the
same
identification
is
implied
in
the
savage
custom
of
killing
the
representative
of
the
with
hoes
or
spades
or
by
grinding
him
between
stones
and
in
the
european
custom
of
pretending
to
kill
him
with
the
scythe
or
the
flail
once
more
the
khond
custom
of
pouring
water
on
the
buried
flesh
of
the
victim
is
parallel
to
the
european
customs
of
pouring
water
on
the
personal
representative
of
the
or
plunging
him
into
a
stream
both
the
khond
and
the
european
customs
are
to
return
now
to
the
lityerses
story
it
has
been
shewn
that
in
rude
society
human
beings
have
been
commonly
killed
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
there
is
therefore
no
improbability
in
the
supposition
that
they
may
once
have
been
killed
for
a
like
purpose
in
phrygia
and
europe
and
when
phrygian
legend
and
european
closely
agreeing
with
each
other
point
to
the
conclusion
that
men
were
so
slain
we
are
bound
provisionally
at
least
to
accept
the
conclusion
further
both
the
lityerses
story
and
european
agree
in
indicating
that
the
victim
was
put
to
death
as
a
representative
of
the
and
this
indication
is
in
harmony
with
the
view
which
some
savages
appear
to
take
of
the
victim
slain
to
make
the
crops
flourish
on
the
whole
then
we
may
fairly
suppose
that
both
in
phrygia
and
in
europe
the
representative
of
the
was
annually
killed
upon
the
grounds
have
been
already
shewn
for
believing
that
similarly
in
europe
the
representative
of
the
was
annually
slain
the
proofs
of
these
two
remarkable
and
closely
analogous
customs
are
entirely
independent
of
each
other
their
coincidence
seems
to
furnish
fresh
presumption
in
favour
of
both
to
the
question
how
was
the
representative
of
the
chosen
one
answer
has
been
already
given
both
the
lityerses
story
and
european
shew
that
passing
strangers
were
regarded
as
manifestations
of
the
escaping
from
the
cut
or
threshed
corn
and
as
such
were
seized
and
slain
but
this
is
not
the
only
answer
which
the
evidence
suggests
according
to
the
phrygian
legend
the
victims
of
lityerses
were
not
simply
passing
strangers
but
persons
whom
he
had
vanquished
in
a
reaping
contest
and
afterwards
wrapt
up
in
and
beheaded
this
suggests
that
the
representative
of
the
may
have
been
selected
by
means
of
a
competition
on
the
in
which
the
vanquished
competitor
was
compelled
to
accept
the
fatal
honour
the
supposition
is
countenanced
by
european
we
have
seen
that
in
europe
there
is
sometimes
a
contest
amongst
the
reapers
to
avoid
being
last
and
that
the
person
who
is
vanquished
in
this
competition
that
is
who
cuts
the
last
corn
is
often
roughly
handled
it
is
true
we
have
not
found
that
a
pretence
is
made
of
killing
him
but
on
the
other
hand
we
have
found
that
a
pretence
is
made
of
killing
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
that
is
who
is
vanquished
in
the
threshing
contest
now
since
it
is
in
the
character
of
representative
of
the
that
the
thresher
of
the
last
corn
is
slain
in
mimicry
and
since
the
same
representative
character
attaches
as
we
have
seen
to
the
cutter
and
binder
as
well
as
to
the
thresher
of
the
last
corn
and
since
the
same
repugnance
is
evinced
by
harvesters
to
be
last
in
any
one
of
these
labours
we
may
conjecture
that
a
pretence
has
been
commonly
made
of
killing
the
reaper
and
binder
as
well
as
the
thresher
of
the
last
corn
and
that
in
ancient
times
this
killing
was
actually
carried
out
this
conjecture
is
corroborated
by
the
common
superstition
that
whoever
cuts
the
last
corn
must
die
soon
sometimes
it
is
thought
that
the
person
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
on
the
field
will
die
in
the
course
of
next
year
the
reason
for
fixing
on
the
reaper
binder
or
thresher
of
the
last
corn
as
the
representative
of
the
may
be
this
the
is
supposed
to
lurk
as
long
as
he
can
in
the
corn
retreating
before
the
reapers
the
binders
and
the
threshers
at
their
work
but
when
he
is
forcibly
expelled
from
his
refuge
in
the
last
corn
cut
or
the
last
sheaf
bound
or
the
last
grain
threshed
he
necessarily
assumes
some
other
form
than
that
of
the
which
had
hitherto
been
his
garment
or
body
and
what
form
can
the
expelled
assume
more
naturally
than
that
of
the
person
who
stands
nearest
to
the
corn
from
which
he
the
has
just
been
expelled
but
the
person
in
question
is
necessarily
the
reaper
binder
or
thresher
of
the
last
corn
he
or
she
therefore
is
seized
and
treated
as
the
himself
thus
the
person
who
was
killed
on
the
as
the
representative
of
the
may
have
been
either
a
passing
stranger
or
the
harvester
who
was
last
at
reaping
binding
or
threshing
but
there
is
a
third
possibility
to
which
ancient
legend
and
modern
alike
point
lityerses
not
only
put
strangers
to
death
he
was
himself
slain
and
apparently
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
slain
others
namely
by
being
wrapt
in
a
beheaded
and
cast
into
the
river
and
it
is
implied
that
this
happened
to
lityerses
on
his
own
land
similarly
in
modern
the
pretence
of
killing
appears
to
be
carried
out
quite
as
often
on
the
person
of
the
master
farmer
or
squire
as
on
that
of
strangers
now
when
we
remember
that
lityerses
was
said
to
have
been
a
son
of
the
king
of
phrygia
and
that
in
one
account
he
is
himself
called
a
king
and
when
we
combine
with
this
the
tradition
that
he
was
put
to
death
apparently
as
a
representative
of
the
we
are
led
to
conjecture
that
we
have
here
another
trace
of
the
custom
of
annually
slaying
one
of
those
divine
or
priestly
kings
who
are
known
to
have
held
ghostly
sway
in
many
parts
of
western
asia
and
particularly
in
phrygia
the
custom
appears
as
we
have
seen
to
have
been
so
far
modified
in
places
that
the
king
s
son
was
slain
in
the
king
s
stead
of
the
custom
thus
modified
the
story
of
lityerses
would
be
in
one
version
at
least
a
reminiscence
turning
now
to
the
relation
of
the
phrygian
lityerses
to
the
phrygian
attis
it
may
be
remembered
that
at
seat
of
a
priestly
appears
to
have
been
annually
slain
in
the
character
of
attis
a
god
of
vegetation
and
that
attis
was
described
by
an
ancient
authority
as
a
reaped
ear
of
thus
attis
as
an
embodiment
of
the
annually
slain
in
the
person
of
his
representative
might
be
thought
to
be
ultimately
identical
with
lityerses
the
latter
being
simply
the
rustic
prototype
out
of
which
the
state
religion
of
attis
was
developed
it
may
have
been
so
but
on
the
other
hand
the
analogy
of
european
warns
us
that
amongst
the
same
people
two
distinct
deities
of
vegetation
may
have
their
separate
personal
representatives
both
of
whom
are
slain
in
the
character
of
gods
at
different
times
of
the
year
for
in
europe
as
we
have
seen
it
appears
that
one
man
was
commonly
slain
in
the
character
of
the
in
spring
and
another
in
the
character
of
the
in
autumn
it
may
have
been
so
in
phrygia
also
attis
was
especially
a
and
his
connexion
with
corn
may
have
been
only
such
an
extension
of
the
power
of
a
as
is
indicated
in
customs
like
the
again
the
representative
of
attis
appears
to
have
been
slain
in
spring
whereas
lityerses
must
have
been
slain
in
summer
or
autumn
according
to
the
time
of
the
harvest
in
phrygia
on
the
whole
then
while
we
are
not
justified
in
regarding
lityerses
as
the
prototype
of
attis
the
two
may
be
regarded
as
parallel
products
of
the
same
religious
idea
and
may
have
stood
to
each
other
as
in
europe
the
old
man
of
harvest
stands
to
the
wild
man
the
leaf
man
and
so
forth
of
spring
both
were
spirits
or
deities
of
vegetation
and
the
personal
representatives
of
both
were
annually
slain
but
whereas
the
attis
worship
became
elevated
into
the
dignity
of
a
state
religion
and
spread
to
italy
the
rites
of
lityerses
seem
never
to
have
passed
the
limits
of
their
native
phrygia
and
always
retained
their
character
of
rustic
ceremonies
performed
by
peasants
on
the
at
most
a
few
villages
may
have
clubbed
together
as
amongst
the
khonds
to
procure
a
human
victim
to
be
slain
as
representative
of
the
for
their
common
benefit
such
victims
may
have
been
drawn
from
the
families
of
priestly
kings
or
kinglets
which
would
account
for
the
legendary
character
of
lityerses
as
the
son
of
a
phrygian
king
or
as
himself
a
king
when
villages
did
not
so
club
together
each
village
or
farm
may
have
procured
its
own
representative
of
the
by
dooming
to
death
either
a
passing
stranger
or
the
harvester
who
cut
bound
or
threshed
the
last
sheaf
perhaps
in
the
olden
time
the
practice
of
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
growth
of
the
corn
may
have
been
as
common
among
the
rude
inhabitants
of
europe
and
western
asia
as
it
still
is
or
was
till
lately
among
the
primitive
agricultural
tribes
of
assam
burma
the
philippine
islands
and
the
indian
archipelago
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
in
phrygia
as
in
europe
the
old
barbarous
custom
of
killing
a
man
on
the
or
the
had
doubtless
passed
into
a
mere
pretence
long
before
the
classical
era
and
was
probably
regarded
by
the
reapers
and
threshers
themselves
as
no
more
than
a
rough
jest
which
the
license
of
a
permitted
them
to
play
off
on
a
passing
stranger
a
comrade
or
even
on
their
master
himself
i
have
dwelt
on
the
lityerses
song
at
length
because
it
affords
so
many
points
of
comparison
with
european
and
savage
the
other
harvest
songs
of
western
asia
and
egypt
to
which
attention
has
been
called
above
may
now
be
dismissed
much
more
briefly
the
similarity
of
the
bithynian
bormus
to
the
phrygian
lityerses
helps
to
bear
out
the
interpretation
which
has
been
given
of
the
latter
bormus
whose
death
or
rather
disappearance
was
annually
mourned
by
the
reapers
in
a
plaintive
song
was
like
lityerses
a
king
s
son
or
at
least
the
son
of
a
wealthy
and
distinguished
man
the
reapers
whom
he
watched
were
at
work
on
his
own
fields
and
he
disappeared
in
going
to
fetch
water
for
them
according
to
one
version
of
the
story
he
was
carried
off
by
the
nymphs
doubtless
the
nymphs
of
the
spring
or
pool
or
river
whither
he
went
to
draw
water
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
lityerses
story
and
of
european
this
disappearance
of
bormus
may
be
a
reminiscence
of
the
custom
of
binding
the
farmer
himself
in
a
and
throwing
him
into
the
water
the
mournful
strain
which
the
reapers
sang
was
probably
a
lamentation
over
the
death
of
the
slain
either
in
the
cut
corn
or
in
the
person
of
a
human
representative
and
the
call
which
they
addressed
to
him
may
have
been
a
prayer
that
he
might
return
in
fresh
vigour
next
year
the
phoenician
linus
song
was
sung
at
the
vintage
at
least
in
the
west
of
asia
minor
as
we
learn
from
homer
and
this
combined
with
the
legend
of
syleus
suggests
that
in
ancient
times
passing
strangers
were
handled
by
vintagers
and
in
much
the
same
way
as
they
are
said
to
have
been
handled
by
the
reaper
lityerses
the
lydian
syleus
so
ran
the
legend
compelled
to
dig
for
him
in
his
vineyard
till
hercules
came
and
killed
him
and
dug
up
his
vines
by
the
roots
this
seems
to
be
the
outline
of
a
legend
like
that
of
lityerses
but
neither
ancient
writers
nor
modern
enable
us
to
fill
in
the
details
but
further
the
linus
song
was
probably
sung
also
by
phoenician
reapers
for
herodotus
compares
it
to
the
maneros
song
which
as
we
have
seen
was
a
lament
raised
by
egyptian
reapers
over
the
cut
corn
further
linus
was
identified
with
adonis
and
adonis
has
some
claims
to
be
regarded
as
especially
a
thus
the
linus
lament
as
sung
at
harvest
would
be
identical
with
the
adonis
lament
each
would
be
the
lamentation
raised
by
reapers
over
the
dead
spirit
of
the
corn
but
whereas
adonis
like
attis
grew
into
a
stately
figure
of
mythology
adored
and
mourned
in
splendid
cities
far
beyond
the
limits
of
his
phoenician
home
linus
appears
to
have
remained
a
simple
ditty
sung
by
reapers
and
vintagers
among
the
and
the
vines
the
analogy
of
lityerses
and
of
both
european
and
savage
suggests
that
in
phoenicia
the
slain
dead
formerly
have
been
represented
by
a
human
victim
and
this
suggestion
is
possibly
supported
by
the
harran
legend
that
tammuz
adonis
was
slain
by
his
cruel
lord
who
ground
his
bones
in
a
mill
and
scattered
them
to
the
wind
for
in
mexico
as
we
have
seen
the
human
victim
at
harvest
was
crushed
between
two
stones
and
both
in
africa
and
india
the
ashes
or
other
remains
of
the
victim
were
scattered
over
the
fields
but
the
harran
legend
may
be
only
a
mythical
way
of
expressing
the
grinding
of
corn
in
the
mill
and
the
scattering
of
the
seed
it
seems
worth
suggesting
that
the
mock
king
who
was
annually
killed
at
the
babylonian
festival
of
the
sacaea
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
month
lous
may
have
represented
tammuz
himself
for
the
historian
berosus
who
records
the
festival
and
its
date
probably
used
the
macedonian
calendar
since
he
dedicated
his
history
to
antiochus
soter
and
in
his
day
the
macedonian
month
lous
appears
to
have
corresponded
to
the
babylonian
month
tammuz
if
this
conjecture
is
right
the
view
that
the
mock
king
at
the
sacaea
was
slain
in
the
character
of
a
god
would
be
established
but
to
this
point
we
shall
return
later
on
there
is
a
good
deal
more
evidence
that
in
egypt
the
slain
dead
represented
by
a
human
victim
whom
the
reapers
slew
on
the
mourning
his
death
in
a
dirge
to
which
the
greeks
through
a
verbal
misunderstanding
gave
the
name
of
maneros
for
the
legend
of
busiris
seems
to
preserve
a
reminiscence
of
human
sacrifices
once
offered
by
the
egyptians
in
connexion
with
the
worship
of
osiris
busiris
was
said
to
have
been
an
egyptian
king
who
sacrificed
all
strangers
on
the
altar
of
zeus
the
origin
of
the
custom
was
traced
to
a
dearth
which
afflicted
the
land
of
egypt
for
nine
years
a
cyprian
seer
informed
busiris
that
the
dearth
would
cease
if
a
man
were
annually
sacrificed
to
zeus
so
busiris
instituted
the
sacrifice
but
when
hercules
came
to
egypt
and
was
being
dragged
to
the
altar
to
be
sacrificed
he
burst
his
bonds
and
slew
busiris
and
his
son
here
then
is
a
legend
that
in
egypt
a
human
victim
was
annually
sacrificed
to
prevent
the
failure
of
the
crops
and
a
belief
is
implied
that
an
omission
of
the
sacrifice
would
have
entailed
a
recurrence
of
that
infertility
which
it
was
the
object
of
the
sacrifice
to
prevent
so
the
pawnees
as
we
have
seen
believed
that
an
omission
of
the
human
sacrifice
at
planting
would
have
been
followed
by
a
total
failure
of
their
crops
the
name
busiris
was
in
reality
the
name
of
a
city
the
house
of
osiris
the
city
being
so
called
because
it
contained
the
grave
of
osiris
indeed
some
high
modern
authorities
believe
that
busiris
was
the
original
home
of
osiris
from
which
his
worship
spread
to
other
parts
of
egypt
the
human
sacrifices
were
said
to
have
been
offered
at
his
grave
and
the
victims
were
men
whose
ashes
were
scattered
abroad
by
means
of
this
tradition
of
human
sacrifices
offered
at
the
tomb
of
osiris
is
confirmed
by
the
evidence
of
the
monuments
for
we
find
in
the
temple
of
dendereh
a
human
figure
with
a
hare
s
head
and
pierced
with
knives
tied
to
a
stake
before
osiris
and
horus
is
shown
in
a
ptolemaic
sculpture
at
karnak
killing
a
bound
figure
before
the
bier
of
osiris
who
is
represented
in
the
form
of
harpocrates
that
these
figures
are
really
human
beings
with
the
head
of
an
animal
fastened
on
is
proved
by
another
sculpture
at
dendereh
where
a
kneeling
man
has
the
hawk
s
head
and
wings
over
his
head
and
shoulders
and
in
another
place
a
priest
has
the
jackal
s
head
on
his
shoulders
his
own
head
appearing
through
the
disguise
besides
diodorus
tells
us
that
the
egyptian
kings
in
former
times
had
worn
on
their
heads
the
of
a
lion
or
of
a
bull
or
of
a
dragon
showing
that
this
method
of
disguise
or
transformation
was
a
in
the
light
of
the
foregoing
discussion
the
egyptian
tradition
of
busiris
admits
of
a
consistent
and
fairly
probable
explanation
osiris
the
was
annually
represented
at
harvest
by
a
stranger
whose
red
hair
made
him
a
suitable
representative
of
the
ripe
corn
this
man
in
his
representative
character
was
slain
on
the
and
mourned
by
the
reapers
who
prayed
at
the
same
time
that
the
might
revive
and
return
maneros
with
renewed
vigour
in
the
following
year
finally
the
victim
or
some
part
of
him
was
burned
and
the
ashes
scattered
by
over
the
fields
to
fertilise
them
here
the
choice
of
the
victim
on
the
ground
of
his
resemblance
to
the
corn
which
he
was
to
represent
agrees
with
the
mexican
and
african
customs
already
described
similarly
the
woman
who
died
in
the
character
of
the
at
the
mexican
midsummer
sacrifice
had
her
face
painted
red
and
yellow
in
token
of
the
colours
of
the
corn
and
she
wore
a
pasteboard
mitre
surmounted
by
waving
plumes
in
imitation
of
the
tassel
of
the
maize
on
the
other
hand
at
the
festival
of
the
goddess
of
the
white
maize
the
mexicans
sacrificed
lepers
the
romans
sacrificed
puppies
in
spring
to
avert
the
supposed
blighting
influence
of
the
believing
that
the
crops
would
thus
grow
ripe
and
ruddy
the
heathen
of
harran
offered
to
the
sun
moon
and
planets
human
victims
who
were
chosen
on
the
ground
of
their
supposed
resemblance
to
the
heavenly
bodies
to
which
they
were
sacrificed
for
example
the
priests
clothed
in
red
and
smeared
with
blood
offered
a
man
to
the
red
planet
mars
in
a
temple
which
was
painted
red
and
draped
with
red
hangings
these
and
the
like
cases
of
assimilating
the
victim
to
the
god
or
to
the
natural
phenomenon
which
he
represents
are
based
ultimately
on
the
principle
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
the
notion
being
that
the
object
aimed
at
will
be
most
readily
attained
by
means
of
a
sacrifice
which
resembles
the
effect
that
it
is
designed
to
bring
about
again
the
scattering
of
the
egyptian
victim
s
ashes
over
the
fields
resembles
the
marimo
and
khond
custom
and
the
use
of
for
the
purpose
is
another
hint
of
his
identification
with
the
corn
so
in
vendée
a
pretence
is
made
of
threshing
and
winnowing
the
farmer
s
wife
regarded
as
an
embodiment
of
the
in
mexico
the
victim
was
ground
between
stones
and
in
africa
he
was
slain
with
spades
and
hoes
the
story
that
the
fragments
of
osiris
s
body
were
scattered
up
and
down
the
land
and
buried
by
isis
on
the
spots
where
they
lay
may
very
well
be
a
reminiscence
of
a
custom
like
that
observed
by
the
khonds
of
dividing
the
human
victim
in
pieces
and
burying
the
pieces
often
at
intervals
of
many
miles
from
each
other
in
the
fields
however
it
is
possible
that
the
story
of
the
dismemberment
of
osiris
like
the
similar
story
told
of
tammuz
may
have
been
simply
a
mythical
expression
for
the
scattering
of
the
seed
once
more
the
legend
that
the
body
of
osiris
enclosed
in
a
coffer
was
thrown
by
typhon
into
the
nile
perhaps
points
to
a
custom
of
casting
the
body
of
the
victim
or
at
least
a
portion
of
it
into
the
nile
as
a
or
rather
to
make
the
river
rise
for
a
similar
purpose
phrygian
reapers
seem
to
have
flung
the
headless
bodies
of
their
victims
wrapt
in
into
a
river
and
the
khonds
poured
water
on
the
buried
flesh
of
the
human
victim
probably
when
osiris
ceased
to
be
represented
by
a
human
victim
an
image
of
him
was
annually
thrown
into
the
nile
just
as
the
effigy
of
his
syrian
counterpart
adonis
used
to
be
cast
into
the
sea
at
alexandria
or
water
may
have
been
simply
poured
over
it
as
on
the
monument
already
mentioned
a
priest
is
seen
pouring
water
over
the
body
of
osiris
from
which
are
sprouting
the
accompanying
legend
this
is
osiris
of
the
mysteries
who
springs
from
the
returning
waters
bears
out
the
view
that
at
the
mysteries
of
osiris
a
charm
to
make
rain
fall
or
the
river
rise
was
regularly
wrought
by
pouring
water
on
his
effigy
or
flinging
it
into
the
nile
it
may
be
objected
that
the
victims
were
slain
as
representatives
not
of
osiris
but
of
his
enemy
typhon
for
the
victims
were
called
typhonian
and
red
was
the
colour
of
typhon
black
the
colour
of
osiris
the
answer
to
this
objection
must
be
reserved
for
the
present
meantime
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
if
osiris
is
often
represented
on
the
monuments
as
black
he
is
still
more
commonly
depicted
as
green
appropriately
enough
for
a
who
may
be
conceived
as
black
while
the
seed
is
under
ground
but
as
green
after
it
has
sprouted
so
the
greeks
recognised
both
a
green
and
a
black
demeter
and
sacrificed
to
the
green
demeter
in
spring
with
mirth
and
gladness
thus
if
i
am
right
the
key
to
the
mysteries
of
osiris
is
furnished
by
the
melancholy
cry
of
the
egyptian
reapers
which
down
to
roman
times
could
be
heard
year
after
year
sounding
across
the
fields
announcing
the
death
of
the
the
rustic
prototype
of
osiris
similar
cries
as
we
have
seen
were
also
heard
on
all
the
of
western
asia
by
the
ancients
they
are
spoken
of
as
songs
but
to
judge
from
the
analysis
of
the
names
linus
and
maneros
they
probably
consisted
only
of
a
few
words
uttered
in
a
prolonged
musical
note
which
could
be
heard
for
a
great
distance
such
sonorous
and
cries
raised
by
a
number
of
strong
voices
in
concert
must
have
had
a
striking
effect
and
could
hardly
fail
to
arrest
the
attention
of
any
wayfarer
who
happened
to
be
within
hearing
the
sounds
repeated
again
and
again
could
probably
be
distinguished
with
tolerable
ease
even
at
a
distance
but
to
a
greek
traveller
in
asia
or
egypt
the
foreign
words
would
commonly
convey
no
meaning
and
he
might
take
them
not
unnaturally
for
the
name
of
some
one
maneros
linus
lityerses
bormus
upon
whom
the
reapers
were
calling
and
if
his
journey
led
him
through
more
countries
than
one
as
bithynia
and
phrygia
or
phoenicia
and
egypt
while
the
corn
was
being
reaped
he
would
have
an
opportunity
of
comparing
the
various
harvest
cries
of
the
different
peoples
thus
we
can
readily
understand
why
these
harvest
cries
were
so
often
noted
and
compared
with
each
other
by
the
greeks
whereas
if
they
had
been
regular
songs
they
could
not
have
been
heard
at
such
distances
and
therefore
could
not
have
attracted
the
attention
of
so
many
travellers
and
moreover
even
if
the
wayfarer
were
within
hearing
of
them
he
could
not
so
easily
have
picked
out
the
words
down
to
recent
times
devonshire
reapers
uttered
cries
of
the
same
sort
and
performed
on
the
field
a
ceremony
exactly
analogous
to
that
in
which
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
rites
of
osiris
originated
the
cry
and
the
ceremony
are
thus
described
by
an
observer
who
wrote
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
after
the
wheat
is
all
cut
on
most
farms
in
the
north
of
devon
the
harvest
people
have
a
custom
of
crying
the
i
believe
that
this
practice
is
seldom
omitted
on
any
large
farm
in
that
part
of
the
country
it
is
done
in
this
way
an
old
man
or
some
one
else
well
acquainted
with
the
ceremonies
used
on
the
occasion
when
the
labourers
are
reaping
the
last
field
of
wheat
goes
round
to
the
shocks
and
sheaves
and
picks
out
a
little
bundle
of
all
the
best
ears
he
can
find
this
bundle
he
ties
up
very
neat
and
trim
and
plats
and
arranges
the
straws
very
tastefully
this
is
called
the
neck
of
wheat
or
after
the
field
is
cut
out
and
the
pitcher
once
more
circulated
the
reapers
binders
and
the
women
stand
round
in
a
circle
the
person
with
the
neck
stands
in
the
centre
grasping
it
with
both
his
hands
he
first
stoops
and
holds
it
near
the
ground
and
all
the
men
forming
the
ring
take
off
their
hats
stooping
and
holding
them
with
both
hands
towards
the
ground
they
then
all
begin
at
once
in
a
very
prolonged
and
harmonious
tone
to
cry
the
neck
at
the
same
time
slowly
raising
themselves
upright
and
elevating
their
arms
and
hats
above
their
heads
the
person
with
the
neck
also
raising
it
on
high
this
is
done
three
times
they
then
change
their
cry
to
wee
yen
way
yen
they
sound
in
the
same
prolonged
and
slow
manner
as
before
with
singular
harmony
and
effect
three
times
this
last
cry
is
accompanied
by
the
same
movements
of
the
body
and
arms
as
in
crying
the
after
having
thus
repeated
the
neck
three
times
and
wee
yen
or
way
yen
as
often
they
all
burst
out
into
a
kind
of
loud
and
joyous
laugh
flinging
up
their
hats
and
caps
into
the
air
capering
about
and
perhaps
kissing
the
girls
one
of
them
then
gets
the
neck
and
runs
as
hard
as
he
can
down
to
the
farmhouse
where
the
dairymaid
or
one
of
the
young
female
domestics
stands
at
the
door
prepared
with
a
pail
of
water
if
he
who
holds
the
neck
can
manage
to
get
into
the
house
in
any
way
unseen
or
openly
by
any
other
way
than
the
door
at
which
the
girl
stands
with
the
pail
of
water
then
he
may
lawfully
kiss
her
but
if
otherwise
he
is
regularly
soused
with
the
contents
of
the
bucket
on
a
fine
still
autumn
evening
the
crying
of
the
neck
has
a
wonderful
effect
at
a
distance
far
finer
than
that
of
the
turkish
muezzin
which
lord
byron
eulogises
so
much
and
which
he
says
is
preferable
to
all
the
bells
in
christendom
i
have
once
or
twice
heard
upwards
of
twenty
men
cry
it
and
sometimes
joined
by
an
equal
number
of
female
voices
about
three
years
back
on
some
high
grounds
where
our
people
were
harvesting
i
heard
six
or
seven
necks
cried
in
one
night
although
i
know
that
some
of
them
were
four
miles
off
they
are
heard
through
the
quiet
evening
air
at
a
considerable
distance
again
bray
tells
how
travelling
in
devonshire
she
saw
a
party
of
reapers
standing
in
a
circle
on
a
rising
ground
holding
their
sickles
aloft
one
in
the
middle
held
up
some
ears
of
corn
tied
together
with
flowers
and
the
party
shouted
three
times
what
she
writes
as
arnack
arnack
arnack
we
we
we
they
went
home
accompanied
by
women
and
children
carrying
boughs
of
flowers
shouting
and
singing
the
manservant
who
attended
bray
said
it
was
only
the
people
making
their
games
as
they
always
did
the
spirit
of
here
as
miss
burne
remarks
arnack
we
haven
is
obviously
in
the
devon
dialect
a
neck
or
nack
we
have
un
the
neck
is
generally
hung
up
in
the
farmhouse
where
it
sometimes
remains
for
two
or
three
years
a
similar
custom
is
still
observed
in
some
parts
of
cornwall
as
i
was
told
by
my
lamented
friend
middleton
the
last
sheaf
is
decked
with
ribbons
two
men
are
chosen
and
placed
one
with
the
sheaf
on
opposite
sides
of

valley

the
other
shouts

old
custom

now
when
all
the
corn
was
cut
at
heligan
the
farming
men
and
maidens
come
in
front
of
the
house
and
bring
with
them
a
small
sheaf
of
corn
the
last
that
has
been
cut
and
this
is
adorned
with
ribbons
and
flowers
and
one
part
is
tied
quite
tight
so
as
to
look
like
a
neck
then
they
cry
out
our
my
side
my
side
as
loud
as
they
can
then
the
dairymaid
gives
the
neck
to
the
head
he
takes
it
and
says
very
loudly
three
times
i
have
him
i
have
him
i
have
then
another
shouts
very
loudly
what
have
ye
what
have
ye
what
have
ye
then
the
first
says
a
neck
a
neck
a
and
when
he
has
said
this
all
the
people
make
a
very
great
shouting
this
they
do
three
times
and
after
one
famous
shout
go
away
and
eat
supper
and
dance
and
sing
according
to
another
account
all
went
out
to
the
field
when
the
last
corn
was
cut
the
neck
was
tied
with
ribbons
and
plaited
and
they
danced
round
it
and
carried
it
to
the
great
kitchen
where
the
supper
was
the
words
were
as
given
in
the
previous
account
and
hip
hip
hack
heck
i
have
ee
i
have
ee
i
have
it
was
hung
up
in
the
another
account
relates
that
one
of
the
men
rushed
from
the
field
with
the
last
sheaf
while
the
rest
pursued
him
with
vessels
of
water
which
they
tried
to
throw
over
the
sheaf
before
it
could
be
brought
into
the
barn
similar
customs
appear
to
have
been
formerly
observed
in
pembrokeshire
as
appears
from
the
following
account
in
which
however
nothing
is
said
of
the
sonorous
cries
raised
by
the
reapers
when
their
work
was
done
at
in
south
pembrokeshire
the
last
ears
of
corn
left
standing
in
the
field
were
tied
together
and
the
harvesters
then
tried
to
cut
this
neck
by
throwing
their
hatchets
at
it
what
happened
afterwards
appears
to
have
varied
somewhat
i
have
been
told
by
one
old
man
that
the
one
who
got
possession
of
the
neck
would
carry
it
over
into
some
neighbouring
field
leave
it
there
and
take
to
his
heels
as
fast
as
he
could
for
if
caught
he
had
a
rough
time
of
it
the
men
who
caught
him
would
shut
him
up
in
a
barn
without
food
or
belabour
him
soundly
or
perhaps
shoe
him
as
it
was
called
beating
the
soles
of
his
feet
with
very
severe
and
punishment
on
my
grandfather
s
farm
the
man
used
to
make
for
the
house
as
fast
as
possible
and
try
to
carry
in
the
neck
the
maids
were
on
the
for
him
and
did
their
best
to
drench
him
with
water
if
they
succeeded
they
got
the
present
of
which
my
grandfather
always
gave
and
which
was
considered
a
very
liberal
present
indeed
if
the
man
was
successful
in
dodging
the
maids
and
getting
the
neck
into
the
house
without
receiving
the
wetting
the
became
his
the
neck
was
then
hung
up
and
kept
until
the
following
year
at
any
rate
like
the
bunches
of
flowers
or
boughs
gathered
at
the
jean
in
the
south
of
france
sometimes
the
necks
of
many
successive
years
were
to
be
found
hanging
up
together
in
these
two
ways
of
disposing
of
the
neck
one
sees
the
embodiment
no
doubt
of
the
two
ways
of
looking
at
the
as
good
to
be
kept
or
as
bad
to
be
passed
on
to
the
neighbour
in
the
foregoing
customs
a
particular
bunch
of
ears
generally
the
last
left
standing
is
conceived
as
the
neck
of
the
who
is
consequently
beheaded
when
the
bunch
is
cut
down
similarly
in
shropshire
the
name
neck
or
the
gander
s
neck
used
to
be
commonly
given
to
the
last
handful
of
ears
left
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
field
when
all
the
rest
of
the
corn
was
cut
it
was
plaited
together
and
the
reapers
standing
ten
or
twenty
paces
off
threw
their
sickles
at
it
whoever
cut
it
through
was
said
to
have
cut
off
the
gander
s
neck
the
neck
was
taken
to
the
farmer
s
wife
who
was
supposed
to
keep
it
in
the
house
for
good
luck
till
the
next
harvest
came
round
near
trèves
the
man
who
reaps
the
last
standing
corn
cuts
the
goat
s
neck
at
faslane
on
the
gareloch
dumbartonshire
the
last
handful
of
standing
corn
was
sometimes
called
the
at
aurich
in
east
friesland
the
man
who
reaps
the
last
corn
cuts
the
hare
s
tail
in
mowing
down
the
last
corner
of
a
field
french
reapers
sometimes
call
out
we
have
the
cat
by
the
in
bresse
bourgogne
the
last
sheaf
represented
the
fox
beside
it
a
score
of
ears
were
left
standing
to
form
the
tail
and
each
reaper
going
back
some
paces
threw
his
sickle
at
it
he
who
succeeded
in
severing
it
cut
off
the
fox
s
tail
and
a
cry
of
cou
cou
was
raised
in
his
honour
these
examples
leave
no
room
to
doubt
the
meaning
of
the
devonshire
and
cornish
expression
the
neck
as
applied
to
the
last
sheaf
the
is
conceived
in
human
or
animal
form
and
the
last
standing
corn
is
part
of
its
neck
its
head
or
its
tail
sometimes
as
we
have
seen
the
last
corn
is
regarded
as
the
lastly
the
devonshire
custom
of
drenching
with
water
the
person
who
brings
in
the
neck
is
a
such
as
we
have
had
many
examples
of
its
parallel
in
the
mysteries
of
osiris
was
the
custom
of
pouring
water
on
the
image
of
osiris
or
on
the
person
who
represented
him
in
germany
cries
of
or
or
are
sometimes
raised
by
the
reapers
at
cutting
the
last
corn
thus
in
some
places
the
last
patch
of
standing
rye
was
called
the
a
stick
decked
with
flowers
was
inserted
in
it
and
the
ears
were
fastened
to
the
stick
then
all
the
reapers
took
off
their
hats
and
cried
thrice
sometimes
they
accompanied
the
cry
by
clashing
with
their
whetstones
on
their
scythes

animal
embodiments
of
the
in
some
of
the
examples
which
i
have
cited
to
establish
the
meaning
of
the
term
neck
as
applied
to
the
last
sheaf
the
appears
in
animal
form
as
a
gander
a
goat
a
hare
a
cat
and
a
fox
this
introduces
us
to
a
new
aspect
of
the
which
we
must
now
examine
by
doing
so
we
shall
not
only
have
fresh
examples
of
killing
the
god
but
may
hope
also
to
clear
up
some
points
which
remain
obscure
in
the
myths
and
worship
of
adonis
attis
osiris
dionysus
demeter
and
virbius
amongst
the
many
animals
whose
forms
the
is
supposed
to
take
are
the
wolf
dog
hare
fox
cock
goose
quail
cat
goat
cow
ox
bull
pig
and
horse
in
one
or
other
of
these
shapes
the
is
often
believed
to
be
present
in
the
corn
and
to
be
caught
or
killed
in
the
last
sheaf
as
the
corn
is
being
cut
the
animal
flees
before
the
reapers
and
if
a
reaper
is
taken
ill
on
the
field
he
is
supposed
to
have
stumbled
unwittingly
on
the
who
has
thus
punished
the
profane
intruder
it
is
said
the
has
got
hold
of
him
the
has
given
him
a
the
person
who
cuts
the
last
corn
or
binds
the
last
sheaf
gets
the
name
of
the
animal
as
the
the
the
and
so
forth
and
retains
the
name
sometimes
for
a
year
also
the
animal
is
frequently
represented
by
a
puppet
made
out
of
the
last
sheaf
or
of
wood
flowers
and
so
on
which
is
carried
home
amid
rejoicings
on
the
last
even
where
the
last
sheaf
is
not
made
up
in
animal
shape
it
is
often
called
the
the
hare
goat
and
so
forth
generally
each
kind
of
crop
is
supposed
to
have
its
special
animal
which
is
caught
in
the
last
sheaf
and
called
the
the
the
the
or
the
according
to
the
crop
but
sometimes
the
figure
of
the
animal
is
only
made
up
once
for
all
at
getting
in
the
last
crop
of
the
whole
harvest
sometimes
the
creature
is
believed
to
be
killed
by
the
last
stroke
of
the
sickle
or
scythe
but
oftener
it
is
thought
to
live
so
long
as
there
is
corn
still
unthreshed
and
to
be
caught
in
the
last
sheaf
threshed
hence
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
with
the
flail
is
told
that
he
has
got
the
the
or
the
like
when
the
threshing
is
finished
a
puppet
is
made
in
the
form
of
the
animal
and
this
is
carried
by
the
thresher
of
the
last
sheaf
to
a
neighbouring
farm
where
the
threshing
is
still
going
on
this
again
shews
that
the
is
believed
to
live
wherever
the
corn
is
still
being
threshed
sometimes
the
thresher
of
the
last
sheaf
himself
represents
the
animal
and
if
the
people
of
the
next
farm
who
are
still
threshing
catch
him
they
treat
him
like
the
animal
he
represents
by
shutting
him
up
in
the
calling
him
with
the
cries
commonly
addressed
to
pigs
and
so
forth
these
general
statements
will
now
be
illustrated
by
examples
the
as
a
wolf
or
a
dog
we
begin
with
the
conceived
as
a
wolf
or
a
dog
this
conception
is
common
in
france
germany
and
slavonic
countries
thus
when
the
wind
sets
the
corn
in
motion
the
peasants
often
say
the
wolf
is
going
over
or
through
the
corn
the
is
rushing
over
the
field
the
wolf
is
in
the
corn
the
mad
dog
is
in
the
corn
the
big
dog
is
when
children
wish
to
go
into
the
to
pluck
ears
or
gather
the
blue
they
are
warned
not
to
do
so
for
the
big
dog
sits
in
the
corn
or
the
wolf
sits
in
the
corn
and
will
tear
you
in
pieces
the
wolf
will
eat
the
wolf
against
whom
the
children
are
warned
is
not
a
common
wolf
for
he
is
often
spoken
of
as
the
or
the
like
thus
they
say
the
will
come
and
eat
you
up
children
the
will
carry
you
off
and
so
forth
still
he
has
all
the
outward
appearance
of
a
wolf
for
in
the
neighbourhood
of
feilenhof
east
prussia
when
a
wolf
was
seen
running
through
a
field
the
peasants
used
to
watch
whether
he
carried
his
tail
in
the
air
or
dragged
it
on
the
ground
if
he
dragged
it
on
the
ground
they
went
after
him
and
thanked
him
for
bringing
them
a
blessing
and
even
set
before
him
but
if
he
carried
his
tail
high
they
cursed
him
and
tried
to
kill
him
here
the
wolf
is
the
whose
fertilising
power
is
in
his
tail
both
dog
and
wolf
appear
as
embodiments
of
the
in
thus
in
some
parts
of
silesia
the
person
who
cuts
or
binds
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
or
the
but
it
is
in
the
of
the
of
france
that
the
idea
of
the
comes
out
most
clearly
thus
when
a
harvester
through
sickness
weariness
or
laziness
can
not
or
will
not
keep
up
with
the
reaper
in
front
of
him
they
say
the
white
dog
passed
near
him
he
has
the
white
bitch
or
the
white
bitch
has
bitten
in
the
vosges
the
is
called
the
dog
of
the
harvest
and
the
person
who
cuts
the
last
handful
of
hay
or
wheat
is
said
to
kill
the
about
in
the
jura
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
bitch
in
the
neighbourhood
of
verdun
the
regular
expression
for
finishing
the
reaping
is
they
are
going
to
kill
the
dog
and
at
epinal
they
say
according
to
the
crop
we
will
kill
the
or
the
or
the
in
lorraine
it
is
said
of
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
corn
he
is
killing
the
dog
of
the
at
dux
in
the
tyrol
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
said
to
strike
down
the
dog
and
at
ahnebergen
near
stade
he
is
called
according
to
the
crop
so
with
the
wolf
in
silesia
when
the
reapers
gather
round
the
last
patch
of
standing
corn
to
reap
it
they
are
said
to
be
about
to
catch
the
in
various
parts
of
mecklenburg
where
the
belief
in
the
is
particularly
prevalent
every
one
fears
to
cut
the
last
corn
because
they
say
that
the
wolf
is
sitting
in
it
hence
every
reaper
exerts
himself
to
the
utmost
in
order
not
to
be
the
last
and
every
woman
similarly
fears
to
bind
the
last
sheaf
because
the
wolf
is
in
so
both
among
the
reapers
and
the
binders
there
is
a
competition
not
to
be
the
last
to
finish
and
in
germany
generally
it
appears
to
be
a
common
saying
that
the
wolf
sits
in
the
last
in
some
places
they
call
out
to
the
reaper
beware
of
the
wolf
or
they
say
he
is
chasing
the
wolf
out
of
the
in
mecklenburg
the
last
bunch
of
standing
corn
is
itself
commonly
called
the
wolf
and
the
man
who
reaps
it
has
the
wolf
the
animal
being
described
as
the
the
the
and
so
on
according
to
the
particular
crop
the
reaper
of
the
last
corn
is
himself
called
wolf
or
the
if
the
crop
is
rye
and
in
many
parts
of
mecklenburg
he
has
to
support
the
character
by
pretending
to
bite
the
other
harvesters
or
by
howling
like
a
wolf
the
last
sheaf
of
corn
is
also
called
the
wolf
or
the
or
the
according
to
the
crop
and
of
the
woman
who
binds
it
they
say
the
wolf
is
biting
her
she
has
the
wolf
she
must
fetch
the
wolf
out
of
the
corn
moreover
she
herself
is
called
wolf
they
cry
out
to
her
thou
art
the
wolf
and
she
has
to
bear
the
name
for
a
whole
year
sometimes
according
to
the
crop
she
is
called
the
or
the
in
the
island
of
rügen
not
only
is
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
called
wolf
but
when
she
comes
home
she
bites
the
lady
of
the
house
and
the
stewardess
for
which
she
receives
a
large
piece
of
meat
yet
nobody
likes
to
be
the
wolf
the
same
woman
may
be
and
if
she
happens
to
bind
the
last
sheaf
of
rye
wheat
and
oats
at
buir
in
the
district
of
cologne
it
was
formerly
the
custom
to
give
to
the
last
sheaf
the
shape
of
a
wolf
it
was
kept
in
the
barn
till
all
the
corn
was
threshed
then
it
was
brought
to
the
farmer
and
he
had
to
sprinkle
it
with
beer
or
brandy
at
brunshaupten
in
mecklenburg
the
young
woman
who
bound
the
last
sheaf
of
wheat
used
to
take
a
handful
of
stalks
out
of
it
and
make
the
with
them
it
was
the
figure
of
a
wolf
about
two
feet
long
and
half
a
foot
high
the
legs
of
the
animal
being
represented
by
stiff
stalks
and
its
tail
and
mane
by
this
she
carried
back
at
the
head
of
the
harvesters
to
the
village
where
it
was
set
up
on
a
high
place
in
the
parlour
of
the
farm
and
remained
there
for
a
long
time
in
many
places
the
sheaf
called
the
wolf
is
made
up
in
human
form
and
dressed
in
clothes
this
indicates
a
confusion
of
ideas
between
the
conceived
in
human
and
in
animal
form
generally
the
wolf
is
brought
home
on
the
last
waggon
with
joyful
cries
hence
the
last
itself
receives
the
name
of
the
wolf
again
the
wolf
is
supposed
to
hide
himself
amongst
the
cut
corn
in
the
granary
until
he
is
driven
out
of
the
last
bundle
by
the
strokes
of
the
flail
hence
at
wanzleben
near
magdeburg
after
the
threshing
the
peasants
go
in
procession
leading
by
a
chain
a
man
who
is
enveloped
in
the
straw
and
is
called
the
wolf
he
represents
the
who
has
been
caught
escaping
from
the
threshed
corn
in
the
district
of

it
is
believed
that
the
is
killed
at
threshing
the
men
thresh
the
last
sheaf
till
it
is
reduced
to
chopped
straw
in
this
way
they
think
that
the
who
was
lurking
in
the
last
sheaf
has
been
certainly
killed
in
france
also
the
appears
at
harvest
thus
they
call
out
to
the
reaper
of
the
last
corn
you
will
catch
the
near
chambéry
they
form
a
ring
round
the
last
standing
corn
and
cry
the
wolf
is
in
in
finisterre
when
the
reaping
draws
near
an
end
the
harvesters
cry
there
is
the
wolf
we
will
catch
each
takes
a
swath
to
reap
and
he
who
finishes
first
calls
out
i
ve
caught
the
in
guyenne
when
the
last
corn
has
been
reaped
they
lead
a
wether
all
round
the
field
it
is
called
the
wolf
of
the
its
horns
are
decked
with
a
wreath
of
flowers
and
and
its
neck
and
body
are
also
encircled
with
garlands
and
ribbons
all
the
reapers
march
singing
behind
it
then
it
is
killed
on
the
field
in
this
part
of
france
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
which
in
the
patois
means
a
wether
hence
the
killing
of
the
wether
represents
the
death
of
the
considered
as
present
in
the
last
sheaf
but
two
different
conceptions
of
the
a
wolf
and
as
a
mixed
up
together
sometimes
it
appears
to
be
thought
that
the
wolf
caught
in
the
last
corn
lives
during
the
winter
in
the
farmhouse
ready
to
renew
his
activity
as
in
the
spring
hence
at
midwinter
when
the
lengthening
days
begin
to
herald
the
approach
of
spring
the
wolf
makes
his
appearance
once
more
in
poland
a
man
with
a
wolf
s
skin
thrown
over
his
head
is
led
about
at
christmas
or
a
stuffed
wolf
is
carried
about
by
persons
who
collect
money
there
are
facts
which
point
to
an
old
custom
of
leading
about
a
man
enveloped
in
leaves
and
called
the
wolf
while
his
conductors
collected
money
the
as
a
cock
another
form
which
the
often
assumes
is
that
of
a
cock
in
austria
children
are
warned
against
straying
in
the
because
the
sits
there
and
will
peck
their
eyes
out
in
north
germany
they
say
that
the
cock
sits
in
the
last
sheaf
and
at
cutting
the
last
corn
the
reapers
cry
now
we
will
chase
out
the
when
it
is
cut
they
say
we
have
caught
the
at
braller
in
transylvania
when
the
reapers
come
to
the
last
patch
of
corn
they
cry
here
we
shall
catch
the
at
fürstenwalde
when
the
last
sheaf
is
about
to
be
bound
the
master
releases
a
cock
which
he
has
brought
in
a
basket
and
lets
it
run
over
the
field
all
the
harvesters
chase
it
till
they
catch
it
elsewhere
the
harvesters
all
try
to
seize
the
last
corn
cut
he
who
succeeds
in
grasping
it
must
crow
and
is
called
cock
among
the
wends
it
is
or
used
to
be
customary
for
the
farmer
to
hide
a
live
cock
under
the
last
sheaf
as
it
lay
on
the
field
and
when
the
corn
was
being
gathered
up
the
harvester
who
lighted
upon
this
sheaf
had
a
right
to
keep
the
cock
provided
he
could
catch
it
this
formed
the
close
of
the
and
was
known
as
the
and
the
beer
which
was
served
out
to
the
reapers
at
this
time
went
by
the
name
of
the
last
sheaf
is
called
cock
a
distinction
is
made
between
a
and
so
on
according
to
the
crop
at
wünschensuhl
in
thüringen
the
last
sheaf
is
made
into
the
shape
of
a
cock
and
called
the
a
figure
of
a
cock
made
of
wood
pasteboard

of

in
westphalia
where
the
cock
carries
in
his
beak
fruits
of
the

of
all
kinds
sometimes
the
image
of
the

is
fastened
to
the

a

a

elsewhere
this

is
fastened

which
the
leader
of
the
carries
on
her
head
as
she
marches
in

of
the

procession
in

a
live
cock
is
presented
to
the
master
on
a
plate
the
is
called
and
a
chief
dish
at
it
at
least
in
some
places
is
a
cock
if
a
waggoner
upsets
a
it
is
said
that
he
has
spilt
the
harvest
cock
and
he
loses
the
cock
that
is
the
the
with
the
figure
of
the
cock
on
it
is
driven
round
the
farmhouse
before
it
is
taken
to
the
barn
then
the
cock
is
nailed
over
or
at
the
side
of
the
or
on
the
gable
and
remains
there
till
next
harvest
in
east
friesland
the
person
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
called
the
and
grain
is
strewed
before
him
as
if
he
were
a
hen
again
the
is
killed
in
the
form
of
a
cock
in
parts
of
germany
hungary
poland
and
picardy
the
reapers
place
a
live
cock
in
the
corn
which
is
to
be
cut
last
and
chase
it
over
the
field
or
bury
it
up
to
the
neck
in
the
ground
afterwards
they
strike
off
its
head
with
a
sickle
or
scythe
in
many
parts
of
westphalia
when
the
harvesters
bring
the
wooden
cock
to
the
farmer
he
gives
them
a
live
cock
which
they
kill
with
whips
or
sticks
or
behead
with
an
old
sword
or
throw
into
the
barn
to
the
girls
or
give
to
the
mistress
to
cook
if
the
has
not
been
is
if
no
waggon
has
been
harvesters
have
the
right
to
kill
the
farmyard
cock
by
throwing
stones
at
it
or
beheading
it
where
this
custom
has
fallen
into
disuse
it
is
still
common
for
the
farmer
s
wife
to
make
for
the
harvesters
and
to
shew
them
the
head
of
the
cock
which
has
been
killed
for
the
soup
in
the
neighbourhood
of
klausenburg
transylvania
a
cock
is
buried
on
the
in
the
earth
so
that
only
its
head
appears
a
young
man
then
takes
a
scythe
and
cuts
off
the
cock
s
head
at
a
single
sweep
if
he
fails
to
do
this
he
is
called
the
red
cock
for
a
whole
year
and
people
fear
that
next
year
s
crop
will
be
bad
near
udvarhely
in
transylvania
a
live
cock
is
bound
up
in
the
last
sheaf
and
killed
with
a
spit
it
is
then
skinned
the
flesh
is
thrown
away
but
the
skin
and
feathers
are
kept
till
next
year
and
in
spring
the
grain
from
the
last
sheaf
is
mixed
with
the
feathers
of
the
cock
and
scattered
on
the
field
which
is
to
be
tilled
nothing
could
set
in
a
clearer
light
the
identification
of
the
cock
with
the
spirit
of
the
corn
by
being
tied
up
in
the
last
sheaf
and
killed
the
cock
is
identified
with
the
corn
and
its
death
with
the
cutting
of
the
corn
by
keeping
its
feathers
till
spring
then
mixing
them
with
the
taken
from
the
very
sheaf
in
which
the
bird
had
been
bound
and
scattering
the
feathers
together
with
the
seed
over
the
field
the
identity
of
the
bird
with
the
corn
is
again
emphasised
and
its
quickening
and
fertilising
power
as
an
embodiment
of
the
is
intimated
in
the
plainest
manner
thus
the
in
the
form
of
a
cock
is
killed
at
harvest
but
rises
to
fresh
life
and
activity
in
spring
again
the
equivalence
of
the
cock
to
the
corn
is
expressed
hardly
less
plainly
in
the
custom
of
burying
the
bird
in
the
ground
and
cutting
off
its
head
like
the
ears
of
corn
with
the
scythe
the
as
a
hare
another
common
embodiment
of
the
is
the
hare
in
galloway
the
reaping
of
the
last
standing
corn
is
called
cutting
the
the
mode
of
cutting
it
is
as
follows
when
the
rest
of
the
corn
has
been
reaped
a
handful
is
left
standing
to
form
the
hare
it
is
divided
into
three
parts
and
plaited
and
the
ears
are
tied
in
a
knot
the
reapers
then
retire
a
few
yards
and
each
throws
his
or
her
sickle
in
turn
at
the
hare
to
cut
it
down
it
must
be
cut
below
the
knot
and
the
reapers
continue
to
throw
their
sickles
at
it
one
after
the
other
until
one
of
them
succeeds
in
severing
the
stalks
below
the
knot
the
hare
is
then
carried
home
and
given
to
a
maidservant
in
the
kitchen
who
places
it
over
the
on
the
inside
sometimes
the
hare
used
to
be
thus
kept
till
the
next
harvest
in
the
parish
of
minnigaff
when
the
hare
was
cut
the
unmarried
reapers
ran
home
with
all
speed
and
the
one
who
arrived
first
was
the
first
to
be
married
in
southern
ayrshire
the
last
corn
cut
is
also
called
the
hare
and
the
mode
of
cutting
it
seems
to
be
the
same
as
in
galloway
at
least
in
the
neighbourhood
of
kilmarnock
the
last
corn
left
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
field
is
plaited
and
the
reapers
used
to
try
to
cut
it
by
throwing
their
sickles
at
it
when
cut
it
was
carried
home
and
hung
up
over
the
door
in
the
vosges
mountains
the
person
who
cuts
the
last
handful
of
hay
or
wheat
is
sometimes
said
to
have
caught
the
hare
he
is
congratulated
by
his
comrades
and
has
the
honour
of
carrying
the
nosegay
or
the
small
decorated
with
ribbons
which
marks
the
conclusion
of
the
harvest
in
germany
also
one
of
the
names
for
the
last
sheaf
is
the
hare
thus
in
some
parts
of
anhalt
when
the
corn
has
been
reaped
and
only
a
few
stalks
are
left
standing
they
say
the
hare
will
soon
come
or
the
reapers
cry
to
each
other
look
how
the
hare
comes
jumping
in
east
prussia
they
say
that
the
hare
sits
in
the
last
patch
of
standing
corn
and
must
be
chased
out
by
the
last
reaper
the
reapers
hurry
with
their
work
each
being
anxious
not
to
have
to
chase
out
the
hare
for
the
man
who
does
so
that
is
who
cuts
the
last
corn
is
much
laughed
at
at
birk
in
transylvania
when
the
reapers
come
to
the
last
patch
they
cry
out
we
have
the
at
aurich
as
we
have
seen
an
expression
for
cutting
the
last
corn
is
to
cut
off
the
hare
s
he
is
killing
the
hare
is
commonly
said
of
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
corn
in
germany
sweden
holland
france
and
italy
in
norway
the
man
who
is
thus
said
to
kill
the
hare
must
give
hare
s
blood
in
the
form
of
brandy
to
his
fellows
to
drink
in
lesbos
when
the
reapers
are
at
work
in
two
neighbouring
fields
each
party
tries
to
finish
first
in
order
to
drive
the
hare
into
their
neighbour
s
field
the
reapers
who
succeed
in
doing
so
believe
that
next
year
the
crop
will
be
better
a
small
sheaf
of
corn
is
made
up
and
kept
beside
the
holy
picture
till

the
expression
for

when

they
kill

itself
called
the
goat
thus
in
the
valley
of
the
wiesent
bavaria
the
last
sheaf
bound
on
the
field
is
called
the
goat
and
they
have
a
proverb
the
field
must
bear
a
at
spachbrücken
in
hesse
the
last
handful
of
corn
which
is
cut
is
called
the
goat
and
the
man
who
cuts
it
is
much
ridiculed
at
dürrenbüchig
and
about
mosbach
in
baden
the
last
sheaf
is
also
called
the
goat
sometimes
the
last
sheaf
is
made
up
in
the
form
of
a
goat
and
they
say
the
goat
is
sitting
in
again
the
person
who
cuts
or
binds
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
goat
thus
in
parts
of
mecklenburg
they
call
out
to
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
sheaf
you
are
the
near
uelzen
in
hanover
the
harvest
festival
begins
with
the
bringing
of
the
that
is
the
woman
who
bound
the
last
sheaf
is
wrapt
in
straw
crowned
with
a
and
brought
in
a
wheelbarrow
to
the
village
where
a
round
dance
takes
place
about
luneburg
also
the
woman
who
binds
the
last
corn
is
decked
with
a
crown
of
and
is
called
the
at
münzesheim
in
baden
the
reaper
who
cuts
the
last
handful
of
corn
or
oats
is
called
the
or
the
in
the
canton
gall
switzerland
the
person
who
cuts
the
last
handful
of
corn
on
the
field
or
drives
the
last
to
the
barn
is
called
the
or
the
or
simply
the
goat
in
the
canton
thurgau
he
is
called
like
a
goat
he
has
a
bell
hung
round
his
neck
is
led
in
triumph
and
drenched
with
liquor
in
parts
of
styria
also
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
corn
is
called
or
the
like
as
a
rule
the
man
who
thus
gets
the
name
of
has
to
bear
it
a
whole
year
till
the
next
harvest
according
to
one
view
the
who
has
been
caught
in
the
form
of
a
goat
or
otherwise
lives
in
the
farmhouse
or
barn
over
winter
thus
each
farm
has
its
own
embodiment
of
the
but
according
to
another
view
the
is
the
genius
or
deity
not
of
the
corn
of
one
farm
only
but
of
all
the
corn
hence
when
the
corn
on
one
farm
is
all
cut
he
flees
to
another
where
there
is
still
corn
left
standing
this
idea
is
brought
out
in
a
which
was
formerly
observed
in
skye
the
farmer
who
first
finished
reaping
sent
a
man
or
woman
with
a
sheaf
to
a
neighbouring
farmer
who
had
not
finished
the
latter
in
his
turn
when
he
had
finished
sent
on
the
sheaf
to
his
neighbour
who
was
still
reaping
and
so
the
sheaf
made
the
round
of
the
farms
till
all
the
corn
was
cut
the
sheaf
was
called
the
that
is
the
cripple
goat
the
custom
appears
not
to
be
extinct
at
the
present
day
for
it
was
reported
from
skye
only
a
few
years
ago
we
are
told
that
when
the
crofters
and
small
farmers
are
cutting
down
their
corn
each
tries
his
best
to
finish
before
his
neighbour
the
first
to
finish
goes
to
his
neighbour
s
field
and
makes
up
at
one
end
of
it
a
bundle
of
sheaves
in
a
fanciful
shape
which
goes
by
the
name
of
the
or
lame
goat
as
each
man
in
succession
finishes
reaping
his
field
he
proceeds
to
set
up
a
lame
goat
of
this
sort
in
his
neighbour
s
field
where
there
is
still
corn
standing
no
one
likes
to
have
the
lame
goat
put
in
his
field
not
from
any
it
brings
but
because
it
is
humiliating
to
have
it
standing
there
visible
to
all
neighbours
and
and
of
course
he
can
not
the
was
probably
thus
represented
as
lame
because
he
had
been
crippled
by
the
cutting
of
the
corn
we
have
seen
that
sometimes
the
old
woman
who
brings
home
the
last
sheaf
must
limp
on
one
foot
in
the
böhmer
wald
mountains
between
bohemia
and
bavaria
when
two
peasants
are
driving
home
their
corn
together
they
race
against
each
other
to
see
who
shall
get
home
first
the
village
boys
mark
the
loser
in
the
race
and
at
night
they
come
and
erect
on
the
roof
of
his
house
the
which
is
a
colossal
figure
of
a
goat
made
of
straw
but
sometimes
the
in
the
form
of
a
goat
is
believed
to
be
slain
on
the
by
the
sickle
or
scythe
thus
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bernkastel
on
the
moselle
the
reapers
determine
by
lot
the
order
in
which
they
shall
follow
each
other
the
first
is
called
the
the
last
the
if
a
reaper
overtakes
the
man
in
front
he
reaps
past
him
bending
round
so
as
to
leave
the
slower
reaper
in
a
patch
by
himself
this
patch
is
called
the
goat
and
the
man
for
whom
the
goat
is
cut
in
this
way
is
laughed
and
jeered
at
by
his
fellows
for
the
rest
of
the
day
when
the
cuts
the
last
ears
of
corn
it
is
said
he
is
cutting
the
goat
s
neck
in
the
neighbourhood
of
grenoble
before
the
end
of
the
reaping
a
live
goat
is
adorned
with
flowers
and
ribbons
and
allowed
to
run
about
the
field
the
reapers
chase
it
and
try
to
catch
it
when
it
is
caught
the
farmer
s
wife
holds
it
fast
while
the
farmer
cuts
off
its
head
the
goat
s
flesh
serves
to
furnish
the
a
piece
of
the
flesh
is
pickled
and
kept
till
the
next
harvest
when
another
goat
is
killed
then
all
the
harvesters
eat
of
the
flesh
on
the
same
day
the
skin
of
the
goat
is
made
into
a
cloak
which
the
farmer
who
works
with
his
men
must
always
wear
at
if
rain
or
bad
weather
sets
in
but
if
a
reaper
gets
pains
in
his
back
the
farmer
gives
him
the
to
wear
the
reason
for
this
seems
to
be
that
the
pains
in
the
back
being
inflicted
by
the
can
also
be
healed
by
it
similarly
we
saw
that
elsewhere
when
a
reaper
is
wounded
at
reaping
a
cat
as
the
representative
of
the
is
made
to
lick
the
wound
esthonian
reapers
in
the
island
of
mon
think
that
the
man
who
cuts
the
first
ears
of
corn
at
harvest
will
get
pains
in
his
back
probably
because
the
is
believed
to
resent
especially
the
first
wound
and
in
order
to
escape
pains
in
the
back
saxon
reapers
in
transylvania
gird
their
loins
with
the
first
handful
of
ears
which
they
cut
here
again
the
is
applied
to
for
healing
or
protection
but
in
his
original
vegetable
form
not
in
the
form
of
a
goat
or
a
cat
further
the
under
the
form
of
a
goat
is
sometimes
conceived
as
lurking
among
the
cut
corn
in
the
barn
till
he
is
driven
from
it
by
the
thus
in
baden
the
last
sheaf
to
be
threshed
is
called
the
the
or
the
according
to
the
kind
of
grain
again
near
marktl
in
upper
bavaria
the
sheaves
are
called
or
simply
goats
they
are
laid
in
a
great
heap
on
the
open
field
and
threshed
by
two
rows
of
men
standing
opposite
each
other
who
as
they
ply
their
flails
sing
a
song
in
which
they
say
that
they
see
the
amongst
the
the
last
goat
that
is
the
last
sheaf
is
adorned
with
a
wreath
of
violets
and
other
flowers
and
with
cakes
strung
together
it
is
placed
right
in
the
middle
of
the
heap
some
of
the
threshers
rush
at
it
and
tear
the
best
of
it
out
others
lay
on
with
their
flails
so
recklessly
that
heads
are
sometimes
broken
in
threshing
this
last
sheaf
each
man
casts
up
to
the
man
opposite
him
the
misdeeds
of
which
he
has
been
guilty
throughout
the
year
at
oberinntal
in
the
tyrol
the
last
thresher
is
called
goat
so
at
haselberg
in
west
bohemia
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
oats
is
called
the
at
tettnang
in
würtemburg
the
thresher
who
gives
the
last
stroke
to
the
last
bundle
of
corn
before
it
is
turned
goes
by
the
name
of
the
and
it
is
said
he
has
driven
the
the
person
who
after
the
bundle
has
been
turned
gives
the
last
stroke
of
all
is
called
the
in
this
custom
it
is
implied
that
the
corn
is
inhabited
by
a
pair
of
male
and
female
further
the
captured
in
the
form
of
a
goat
at
threshing
is
passed
on
to
a
neighbour
whose
threshing
is
not
yet
finished
in
franche
comté
as
soon
as
the
threshing
is
over
the
young
people
set
up
a
straw
figure
of
a
goat
on
the
farmyard
of
a
neighbour
who
is
still
threshing
he
must
give
them
wine
or
money
in
return
at
ellwangen
in
würtemburg
the
effigy
of
a
goat
is
made
out
of
the
last
bundle
of
corn
at
threshing
four
sticks
form
its
legs
and
two
its
horns
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
with
the
flail
must
carry
the
goat
to
the
barn
of
a
neighbour
who
is
still
threshing
and
throw
it
down
on
the
floor
if
he
is
caught
in
the
act
they
tie
the
goat
on
his
back
a
similar
custom
is
observed
at
indersdorf
in
upper
bavaria
the
man
who
throws
the
straw
goat
into
the
neighbour
s
barn
imitates
the
bleating
of
a
goat
if
they
catch
him
they
blacken
his
face
and
tie
the
goat
on
his
back
at
zabern
in
elsace
when
a
farmer
is
a
week
or
more
behind
his
neighbours
with
his
threshing
they
set
a
real
stuffed
goat
or
fox
before
his
door
sometimes
the
spirit
of
the
corn
in
goat
form
is
believed
to
be
killed
at
threshing
in
the
district
of
traunstein
upper
bavaria
they
think
that
the
is
in
the
last
sheaf
of
oats
he
is
represented
by
an
old
rake
set
up
on
end
with
an
old
pot
for
a
head
the
children
are
then
told
to
kill
the
elsewhere
however
the
in
the
form
of
a
goat
is
apparently
thought
to
live
in
the
field
throughout
the
winter
hence
at
wannefeld
near
gardelegen
and
also
between
calbe
and
salzwedel
in
the
altmark
the
last
stalks
used
to
be
left
uncut
on
the
with
the
words
that
shall
the
keep
evidently
the
last
corn
was
here
left
as
a
provision
for
the
lest
robbed
of
all
his
substance
he
should
die
of
hunger
a
stranger
passing
a
is
sometimes
taken
for
the
escaping
in
human
shape
from
the
cut
or
threshed
grain
thus
when
a
stranger
passes
a
all
the
labourers
stop
and
shout
as
with
one
voice
at
threshing
in
schleswig
which
is
generally
done
on
the
field
the
same
cry
is
raised
if
the
stranger
does
not
take
off
his
hat
at
sowing
their
winter
corn
the
old
prussians
used
to
kill
a
goat
consume
its
flesh
with
many
superstitious
ceremonies
and
hang
the
skin
on
a
high
pole
near
an
oak
and
a
large
stone
there
it
remained
till
harvest
when
a
great
bunch
of
corn
and
herbs
was
fastened
to
the
pole
above
the
then
after
a
prayer
had
been
offered
by
a
peasant
who
acted
as
priest
the
young
folks
joined
hands
and
danced
round
the
oak
and
the
pole
afterwards
they
scrambled
for
the
bunch
of
corn
and
the
priest
distributed
the
herbs
with
a
sparing
hand
then
he
placed
the
on
the
large
stone
sat
down
on
it
and
preached
to
the
people
about
the
history
of
their
forefathers
and
their
old
heathen
customs
and
beliefs
the
thus
suspended
on
the
field
from
sowing
time
to
harvest
perhaps
represents
the
superintending
the
growth
of
the
corn
the
tomori
of
central
celebes
imagine
that
the
spirits
which
cause
rice
to
grow
have
the
form
of
great
goats
with
long
hair
and
long
lips
the
as
a
bull
cow
or
ox
another
form
which
the
often
assumes
is
that
of
a
bull
cow
or
ox
when
the
wind
sweeps
over
the
corn
they
say
at
conitz
in
west
prussia
the
steer
is
running
in
the
corn
when
the
corn
is
thick
and
strong
in
one
spot
they
say
in
some
parts
of
east
prussia
the
bull
is
lying
in
the
when
a
harvester
has
overstrained
and
lamed
himself
they
say
in
the
graudenz
district
of
west
prussia
the
bull
pushed
him
in
lothringen
they
say
he
has
the
the
meaning
of
both
expressions
is
that
he
has
unwittingly
lighted
upon
the
divine
who
has
punished
the
profane
intruder
with
lameness
so
near
chambéry
when
a
reaper
wounds
himself
with
his
sickle
it
is
said
that
he
has
the
wound
of
the
in
the
district
of
bunzlau
silesia
the
last
sheaf

sometimes
made
into
the
shape
of

with

called
the

in
some
parts
of
bohemia
the

made
up
in
human
form
and
called
the
these
cases
shew
a
confusion
of
the
human
with
the
animal
shape
of
the
the
confusion
is
like
that
of
killing
a
wether
under
the
name
of
a
wolf
in
the
canton
of
thurgau
switzerland
the
last
sheaf
if
it
is
a
large
one
is
called
the
cow
all
over
swabia
the
last
bundle
of
corn
on
the
field
is
called
the
cow
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
ears
has
the
cow
and
is
himself
called
cow
or
or
according
to
the
crop
at
the
he
gets
a
nosegay
of
flowers
and
and
a
more
liberal
allowance
of
drink
than
the
rest
but
he
is
teased
and
laughed
at
so
no
one
likes
to
be
the
cow
the
cow
was
sometimes
represented
by
the
figure
of
a
woman
made
out
of
ears
of
corn
and
it
was
carried
to
the
farmhouse
by
the
man
who
had
cut
the
last
handful
of
corn
the
children
ran
after
him
and
the
neighbours
turned
out
to
laugh
at
him
till
the
farmer
took
the
cow
from
him
here
again
the
confusion
between
the
human
and
the
animal
form
of
the
is
apparent
in
various
parts
of
switzerland
the
reaper
who
cuts
the

ears
of

called

is
the
butt
of
many
a
joke
in
some

a
few

been
left
standing

inadvertence

seizes
them

on

spring
of
the
year
it
is
followed
by
all
the
reapers
with
their
tools
then
it
is
allowed
to
run
free
the
reapers
chase
it
and
whoever
catches
it
is
called
king
of
the
calf
lastly
it
is
solemnly
killed
at
lunéville
the
man
who
acts
as
butcher
is
the
jewish
merchant
of
the
village
sometimes
again
the
hides
himself
amongst
the
cut
corn
in
the
barn
to
reappear
in
bull
or
cow
form
at
threshing
thus
at
wurmlingen
in
thüringen
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
called
the
cow
or
rather
the
or
the
like
according
to
the
crop
he
is
entirely
enveloped
in
straw
his
head
is
surmounted
by
sticks
in
imitation
of
horns
and
two
lads
lead
him
by
ropes
to
the
well
to
drink
on
the
way
thither
he
must
low
like
a
cow
and
for
a
long
time
afterwards
he
goes
by
the
name
of
the
cow
at
obermedlingen
in
swabia
when
the
threshing
draws
near
an
end
each
man
is
careful
to
avoid
giving
the
last
stroke
he
who
does
give
it
gets
the
cow
which
is
a
straw
figure
dressed
in
an
old
ragged
petticoat
hood
and
stockings
it
is
tied
on
his
back
with
a
his
face
is
blackened
and
being
bound
with
to
a
wheelbarrow
he
is
wheeled
round
the
village
here
again
we
meet
with
that
confusion
between
the
human
and
animal
shape
of
the
which
we
have
noted
in
other
customs
in
canton
schaffhausen
the
man
who
threshes
the
last
corn
is
called
the
cow
in
canton
thurgau
the
in
canton
zurich
the
in
the
district
he
is
wrapt
in
straw
and
bound
to
one
of
the
trees
in
the
orchard
at
arad
in
hungary
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
is
enveloped
in
straw
and
a
cow
s
hide
with
the
horns
attached
to
it
at
pessnitz
in
the
district
of
dresden
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
with
the
flail
is
called
bull
he
must
make
a
and
set
it
up
before
a
neighbour
s
window
here
apparently
as
in
so
many
cases
the
is
passed
on
to
a
neighbour
who
has
not
finished
threshing
so
at
herbrechtingen
in
thüringen
the
effigy
of
a
ragged
old
woman
is
flung
into
the
barn
of
the
farmer
who
is
last
with
his
threshing
the
man
who
throws
it
in
cries
there
is
the
cow
for
if
the
threshers
catch
him
they
detain
him
over
night
and
punish
him
by
keeping
him
from
the
in
these
latter
customs
the
confusion
between
the
human
and
the
animal
shape
of
the
meets
us
again
further
the
in
bull
form
is
sometimes
believed
to
be
killed
at
threshing
at
auxerre
in
threshing
the
last
bundle
of
corn
they
call
out
twelve
times
we
are
killing
the
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bordeaux
where
a
butcher
kills
an
ox
on
the
field
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
reaping
it
is
said
of
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
that
he
has
killed
the
at
chambéry
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
sheaf
of
the
young
ox
and
a
race
takes
place
to
it
in
which
all
the
reapers
join
when
the
last
stroke
is
given
at
threshing
they
say
that
the
ox
is
killed
and
immediately
thereupon
a
real
ox
is
slaughtered
by
the
reaper
who
cut
the
last
corn
the
flesh
of
the
ox
is
eaten
by
the
threshers
at
supper
we
have
seen
that
sometimes
the
young
whose
task
it
is
to
quicken
the
corn
of
the
coming
year
is
believed
to
be
born
as
a
on
the
similarly
in
berry
the
young
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
born
on
the
field
in
calf
form
for
when
a
binder
has
not
rope
enough
to
bind
all
the
corn
in
sheaves
he
puts
aside
the
wheat
that
remains
over
and
imitates
the
lowing
of
a
cow
the
meaning
is
that
the
sheaf
has
given
birth
to
a
in
when
a
binder
can
not
keep
up
with
the
reaper
whom
he
or
she
follows
they
say
he
or
she
is
giving
birth
to
the
in
some
parts
of
prussia
in
similar
circumstances
they
call
out
to
the
woman
the
bull
is
coming
and
imitate
the
bellowing
of
a
bull
in
these
cases
the
woman
is
conceived
as
the
or
old
while
the
supposed
calf
is
the
or
young
in
some
parts
of
austria
a
mythical
calf
is
believed
to
be
seen
amongst
the
sprouting
corn
in
spring
and
to
push
the
children
when
the
corn
waves
in
the
wind
they
say
the
calf
is
going
clearly
as
mannhardt
observes
this
calf
of
the
is
the
same
animal
which
is
afterwards
believed
to
be
killed
at
reaping
the
as
a
horse
or
mare
sometimes
the
appears
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
or
mare
between
kalw
and
stuttgart
when
the
corn
bends
before
the
wind
they
say
there
runs
the
at
bohlingen
near
radolfzell
in
baden
the
last
sheaf
of
oats
is
called
the
in
hertfordshire
at
the
end
of
the
reaping
there
is
or
used
to
be
observed
a
ceremony
called
crying
the
the
last
blades
of
corn
left
standing
on
the
field
are
tied
together
and
called
the
mare
the
reapers
stand
at
a
distance
and
throw
their
sickles
at
it
he
who
cuts
it
through
has
the
prize
with
acclamations
and
good
after
it
is
cut
the
reapers
cry
thrice
with
a
loud
voice
i
have
her
others
answer
thrice
what
have
you

a

you
send
her
to
naming
some
neighbour
who
has
not
reaped
all
his
corn
in
this
custom
the
in
the
form
of
a
mare
is
passed
on
from
a
farm
where
the
corn
is
all
cut
to
another
farm
where
it
is
still
standing
and
where
therefore
the
may
be
supposed
naturally
to
take
refuge
in
shropshire
the
custom
is
similar
crying
calling
or
shouting
the
mare
is
a
ceremony
performed
by
the
men
of
that
farm
which
is
the
first
in
any
parish
or
district
to
finish
the
harvest
the
object
of
it
is
to
make
known
their

to

any

else
is
said
to
keep

all
the
mocking
offer
of
the
mare
was
sometimes
responded
to
by
a
mocking
acceptance
of
her
help
thus
an
old
man
told
an
enquirer
while
we
wun
at
supper
a
mon

at

near

the

used
really
to
be
sent
the
head
man
of
the
farmer
who
had
finished
harvest
first
was
mounted
on
the
best
horse
of
the
horse
and
man
being
adorned
with
ribbons
streamers
etc
thus
arrayed
a
boy
on
foot
led
the
pair
in
triumph
to
the
neighbouring
farmhouses
sometimes
the
man
who
took
the
mare
received
as
well
as
plenty
of
some
rather
rough
though
treatment
coming
back
minus
his
decorations
and
so
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lille
the
idea
of
the
in
horse
form
is
clearly
preserved
when
a
harvester
grows
weary
at
his
work
it
is
said
he
has
the
fatigue
of
the
the
first
sheaf
called
the
cross
of
the
horse
is
placed
on
a
cross
of
boxwood
in
the
barn
and
the
youngest
horse
on
the
farm
must
tread
on
it
the
reapers
dance
round
the
last
blades
of
corn
crying
see
the
remains
of
the
the
sheaf
made
out
of
these
last
blades
is
given
to
the
youngest
horse
of
the
parish
to
eat
this
youngest
horse
of
the
parish
clearly
represents
as
mannhardt
says
the
of
the
following
year
the
which
absorbs
the
spirit
of
the
old
by
eating
the
last
corn
cut
for
as
usual
the
old
takes
his
final
refuge
in
the
last
sheaf
the
thresher
of
the
last
sheaf
is
said
to
beat
the
again
a
trace
of
the
is
reported
from
berry
the
harvesters
there
are
accustomed
to
take
a
noonday
nap
in
the
field
this
is
called
seeing
the
the
leader
or
king
of
the
harvesters
gives
the
signal
for
going
to
sleep
if
he
delays
giving
the
signal
one
of
the
harvesters
will
begin
to
neigh
like
a
horse
the
rest
imitate
him
and
then
they
all
go
to
see
the
the
as
a
bird
sometimes
the
assumes
the
form
of
a
bird
thus
among
the
saxons
of
the
bistritz
district
in
transylvania
there
is
a
saying
that
the
quail
is
sitting
in
the
last
standing
stalks
on
the
and
all
the
reapers
rush
at
these
stalks
in
order
as
they
say
to
catch
the
quail
exactly
the
same
expression
is
used
by
reapers
in
austrian
silesia
when
they
are
about
to
cut
the
last
standing
corn
whatever
the
kind
of
grain
may
be
in
the
bocage
of
normandy
when
the
reapers
have
come
to
the
last
ears
of
the
last
rig
they
surround
them
for
the
purpose
of
catching
the
quail
which
is
supposed
to
have
taken
refuge
there
they
run
about
the
corn
crying
mind
the
quail
and
make
believe
to
grab
at
the
bird
amid
shouts
and
laughter
connected
with
this
identification
of
the
with
a
quail
is
probably
the
belief
that
the
cry
of
the
bird
in
spring
is
prophetic
of
the
price
of
corn
in
the
autumn
in
germany
they
say
that
corn
will
sell
at
as
many
gulden
a
bushel
as
the
quail
uttered
its
cry
over
the
fields
in
spring
similar
prognostications
are
drawn
from
the
note
of
the
bird
in
central
and
western
france
in
switzerland
and
in
tuscany
perhaps
one
reason
for
identifying
the
quail
with
the
is
that
the
bird
lays
its
eggs
on
the
ground
without
making
much
of
a
nest
similarly
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
think
that
the
soul
of
the
rice
is
embodied
in
a
pretty
little
blue
bird
which
builds
its
nest
in
the
at
the
time
when
the
rice
is
beginning
to
germinate
and
which
disappears
again
after
the
harvest
thus
both
the
place
and
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
the
bird
suggest
to
the
natives
the
notion
that
the
blue
bird
is
the
rice
incarnate
and
like
the
note
of
the
quail
in
europe
the
note
of
this
little
bird
in
celebes
is
believed
to
prognosticate
the
state
of
the
harvest
foretelling
whether
the
rice
will
be
abundant
or
scarce
nobody
may
drive
the
bird
away
to
do
so
would
not
merely
injure
the
rice
it
would
hurt
the
eyes
of
the
sacrilegious
person
and
might
even
strike
him
blind
in
minahassa
a
district
in
the
north
of
celebes
a
similar
though
less
definite
belief
attaches
to
a
sort
of
small
quail
which
loves
to
haunt
the
before
the
rice
is
reaped
and
when
the
galelareeze
of
halmahera
hear
a
certain
kind
of
bird
which
they
call
croaking
among
the
rice
in
ear
they
say
that
the
bird
is
putting
the
grain
into
the
rice
so
they
will
not
kill
it
the
as
a
fox
another
animal
whose
shape
the
is
sometimes
thought
to
assume
is
the
fox
the
conception
is
recorded
at
various
places
in
germany
and
france
thus
at
nördlingen
in
bavaria
when
the
corn
waves
to
and
fro
in
the
wind
they
say
the
fox
goes
through
the
corn
and
at
usingen
in
nassau
they
say
the
foxes
are
marching
through
the
at
ravensberg
in
westphalia
and
at
steinau
in
kurhessen
children
are
warned
against
straying
in
the
corn
because
the
fox
is
at
campe
near
stade
when
they
are
about
to
cut
the
last
corn
they
call
out
to
the
reaper
the
fox
is
sitting
there
hold
him
fast
in
the
department
of
the
moselle
they
say
watch
whether
the
fox
comes
in
bourbonnais
the
expression
is
you
will
catch
the
when
a
reaper
wounds
himself
or
is
sick
at
reaping
they
say
in
the
lower
loire
that
he
has
the
in
or
they
say
he
has
killed
the
at
louhans
in
when
the
reapers
are
cutting
the
last
corn
they
leave
a
handful
standing
and
throw
their
sickles
at
it
he
who
hits
it
is
called
the
fox
and
two
girls
deck
his
bonnet
with
flowers
in
the
evening
there
is
a
dance
at
which
the
fox
dances
with
all
the
girls
the
supper
which
follows
is
also
called
the
fox
they
say
we
have
eaten
the
fox
meaning
that
they
have
partaken
of
the
in
the
canton
of
zurich
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
fox
at
bourgogne
in
ain
they
cry
out
the
fox
is
sitting
in
the
last
sheaf
and
having
made
the
figure
of
an
animal
out
of
white
cloth
and
some
ears
of
the
last
corn
they
dub
it
the
fox
and
throw
it
into
the
house
of
a
neighbour
who
has
not
yet
got
in
all
his
harvest
in
poitou
when
the
corn
is
being
reaped
in
a
district
all
the
reapers
strive
to
finish
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
that
they
may
send
the
fox
to
the
fields
of
a
farmer
who
has
not
yet
garnered
his
sheaves
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
handful
of
standing
corn
is
said
to
have
the
this
last
handful
is
carried
to
the
farmer
s
house
and
occupies
a
place
on
the
table
during
the
and
the
custom
is
to
drench
it
with
water
after
that
it
is
set
up
on
the
and
remains
there
the
whole
year
at
threshing
also
in
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
fox
in
lot
they
say
we
are
going
to
beat
the
fox
and
at
zabern
in
alsace
they
set
a
stuffed
fox
before
the
door
of
the
of
a
neighbour
who
has
not
finished
his
threshing
with
this
conception
of
the
fox
as
an
embodiment
of
the
may
possibly
be
connected
an
old
custom
observed
in
holstein
and
westphalia
of
carrying
a
dead
or
living
fox
from
house
to
house
in
spring
the
intention
of
the
custom
was
perhaps
to
diffuse
the
refreshing
and
invigorating
influence
of
the
reawakened
spirit
of
vegetation
in
japan
the
inari
is
represented
as
an
elderly
man
with
a
long
beard
riding
on
a
white
fox
and
the
fox
is
always
associated
with
this
deity
in
front
of
his
shrines
may
usually
be
seen
a
pair
of
foxes
carved
in
wood
or
stone
the
as
a
pig
boar
or
sow
the
last
animal
embodiment
of
the
which
we
shall
notice
is
the
pig
boar
or
sow
in
thüringen
when
the
wind
sets
the
young
corn
in
motion
they
sometimes
say
the
boar
is
rushing
through
the
amongst
the
esthonians
of
the
island
of
oesel
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
and
the
man
who
gets
it
is
saluted
with
a
cry
of
you
have
the
on
your
back
in
reply
he
strikes
up
a
song
in
which
he
prays
for
plenty
at
kohlerwinkel
near
augsburg
at
the
close
of
the

the

cut
down
stalk
by

by
all
the
reapers
in
turn
he
who
cuts
the
last
stalk
gets
the
sow
and
is
laughed
at
in
other
swabian
villages
also
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
corn
has
the
sow
or
has
the
in
the
traunstein
district
upper
bavaria
the
man
who
cuts
the
last
handful
of
rye
or
wheat
has
the
sow
and
is
called
at
bohlingen
near
radolfzell
in

the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
or
the
according
to
the

and
at
röhrenbach
in

the
person
who
brings
the
last
armful
for
the

is
called

and
in
the
of

the
thresher
who
gives
the

stroke
at
threshing
or
is

at
onstmettingen
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
has
the
sow
he
is
often
bound
up
in
a
sheaf
and
dragged
by
a
rope
along
the
ground
and
generally
in
swabia
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
with
the
flail
is
called
sow
he
may
however
rid
himself
of
this
invidious
distinction
by
passing
on
to
a
neighbour
the
which
is
the
badge
of
his
position
as
sow
so
he
goes
to
a
house
and
throws
the
into
it
crying
there
i
bring
you
the
all
the
inmates
give
chase
and
if
they
catch
him
they
beat
him
shut
him
up
for
several
hours
in
the
and
oblige
him
to
take
the
sow
away
again
in
various
parts
of
upper
bavaria
the
man
who
gives
the
last
stroke
at
threshing
must
carry
the
pig
is
either
a
straw
effigy
of
a
pig
or
merely
a
bundle
of
this
he
carries
to
a
neighbouring
farm
where
the
threshing
is
not
finished
and
throws
it
into
the
barn
if
the
threshers
catch
him
they
handle
him
roughly
beating
him
blackening
or
dirtying
his
face
throwing
him
into
filth
binding
the
sow
on
his
back
and
so
on
if
the
bearer
of
the
sow
is
a
woman
they
cut
off
her
hair
at
the
harvest
supper
or
dinner
the
man
who
carried
the
pig
gets
one
or
more
dumplings
made
in
the
form
of
pigs
sometimes
he
gets
a
large
dumpling
and
a
number
of
small
ones
all
in
pig
form
the
large
one
being
called
the
sow
and
the
small
ones
the
sometimes
he
has
the
right
to
be
the
first
to
put
his
hand
into
the
dish
and
take
out
as
many
small
dumplings
as
he
can
while
the
other
threshers
strike
at
his
hand
with
spoons
or
sticks
when
the
dumplings
are
served
up
by
the
all
the
people
at
table
cry
süz
süz
süz
that
being
the
cry
used
in
calling
pigs
sometimes
after
dinner
the
man
who
carried
the
pig
has
his
face
blackened
and
is
set
on
a
cart
and
drawn
round
the
village
by
his
fellows
followed
by
a
crowd
crying
süz
süz
süz
as
if
they
were
calling
swine
sometimes
after
being
wheeled
round
the
village
he
is
flung
on
the
dunghill
again
the
in
the
form
of
a
pig
plays
his
part
at
as
well
as
at
harvest
at
neuautz
in
courland
when
barley
is
sown
for
the
first
time
in
the
year
the
farmer
s
wife
boils
the
chine
of
a
pig
along
with
the
tail
and
brings
it
to
the
sower
on
the
field
he
eats
of
it
but
cuts
off
the
tail
and
sticks
it
in
the
field
it
is
believed
that
the
ears
of
corn
will
then
grow
as
long
as
the
tail
here
the
pig
is
the
whose
fertilising
power
is
sometimes
supposed
to
lie
especially
in
his
tail
as
a
pig
he
is
put
in
the
ground
at
and
as
a
pig
he
reappears
amongst
the
ripe
corn
at
harvest
for
amongst
the
neighbouring
esthonians
as
we
have
seen
the
last
sheaf
is
called
the
somewhat
similar
customs
are
observed
in
germany
in
the
salza
district
near
meiningen
a
certain
bone
in
the
pig
is
called
the
jew
on
the
the
flesh
of
this
bone
is
boiled
on
shrove
tuesday
but
the
bone
is
put
amongst
the
ashes
which
the
neighbours
exchange
as
presents
on
peter
s
day
the
of
february
and
then
mix
with
the
in
the
whole
of
hesse
meiningen
and
other
districts
people
eat
with
dried
on
ash
wednesday
or
candlemas
the
ribs
are
then
collected
and
hung
in
the
room
till
when
they
are
inserted
in
the
sown
field
or
in
the
amongst
the
flax
seed
this
is
thought
to
be
an
infallible
specific
against
and
moles
and
to
cause
the
flax
to
grow
well
and
tall
in
many
parts
of
white
russia
people
eat
a
roast
lamb
or
at
easter
and
then
throw
the
bones
backwards
upon
the
fields
to
preserve
the
corn
from
hail
but
the
idea
of
the
as
embodied
in
pig
form
is
nowhere
more
clearly
expressed
than
in
the
scandinavian
custom
of
the
yule
boar
in
sweden
and
denmark
at
yule
christmas
it
is
the
custom
to
bake
a
loaf
in
the
form
of
a
this
is
called
the
yule
boar
the
corn
of
the
last
sheaf
is
often
used
to
make
it
all
through
yule
the
yule
boar
stands
on
the
table
often
it
is
kept
till
the
in
spring
when
part
of
it
is
mixed
with
the
and
part
given
to
the
ploughmen
and
or
to
eat
in
the
expectation
of
a
good
harvest
in
this
custom
the
immanent
in
the
last
sheaf
appears
at
midwinter
in
the
form
of
a
boar
made
from
the
corn
of
the
last
sheaf
and
his
quickening
influence
on
the
corn
is
shewn
by
mixing
part
of
the
yule
boar
with
the
and
giving
part
of
it
to
the
ploughman
and
his
cattle
to
eat
similarly
we
saw
that
the
makes
his
appearance
at
midwinter
the
time
when
the
year
begins
to
verge
towards
spring
we
may
conjecture
that
the
yule
straw
which
swedish
peasants
turn
to
various
superstitious
uses
comes
in
part
at
least
from
the
sheaf
out
of
which
the
yule
boar
is
made
the
yule
straw
is
long
a
portion
of
which
is
always
set
apart
for
this
season
it
is
strewn
over
the
floor
at
christmas
and
the
peasants
attribute
many
virtues
to
it
for
example
they
think
that
some
of
it
scattered
on
the
ground
will
make
a
barren
field
productive
again
the
peasant
at
christmas
seats
himself
on
a
log
and
his
eldest
son
or
daughter
or
the
mother
herself
if
the
children
are
not
old
enough
places
a
wisp
of
the
yule
straw
on
his
knee
from
this
he
draws
out
single
straws
and
throws
them
one
by
one
up
to
the
ceiling
and
as
many
as
lodge
in
the
rafters
so
many
will
be
the
sheaves
of
rye
he
will
have
to
thresh
at
harvest
again
it
is
only
the
yule
straw
which
may
be
used
in
binding
the
as
a
charm
to
fertilise
them
these
uses
of
the
yule
straw
shew
that
it
is
believed
to
possess
fertilising
virtues
analogous
to
those
ascribed
to
the
yule
boar
we
may
therefore
fairly
conjecture
that
the
yule
straw
is
made
from
the
same
sheaf
as
the
yule
boar
formerly
a
real
boar
was
sacrificed
at
christmas
and
apparently
also
a
man
in
the
character
of
the
yule
boar
this
at
least
may
perhaps
be
inferred
from
a
christmas
custom
still
observed
in
sweden
a
man
is
wrapt
up
in
a
skin
and
carries
a
wisp
of
straw
in
his
mouth
so
that
the
projecting
straws
look
like
the
bristles
of
a
boar
a
knife
is
brought
and
an
old
woman
with
her
face
blackened
pretends
to
sacrifice
him
on
christmas
eve
in
some
parts
of
the
esthonian
island
of
oesel
they
bake
a
long
cake
with
the
two
ends
turned
up
it
is
called
the
christmas
boar
and
stands
on
the
table
till
the
morning
of
new
year
s
day
when
it
is
distributed
among
the
cattle
in
other
parts
of
the
island
the
christmas
boar
is
not
a
cake
but
a
little
pig
born
in
march
which
the
housewife
fattens
secretly
often
without
the
knowledge
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
on
christmas
eve
the
little
pig
is
secretly
killed
then
roasted
in
the
oven
and
set
on
the
table
standing
on
all
fours
where
it
remains
in
this
posture
for
several
days
in
other
parts
of
the
island
again
though
the
christmas
cake
has
neither
the
name
nor
the
shape
of
a
boar
it
is
kept
till
the
new
year
when
half
of
it
is
divided
among
all
the
members
and
all
the
quadrupeds
of
the
family
the
other
half
of
the
cake
is
kept
till
comes
round
when
it
is
similarly
distributed
in
the
morning
among
human
beings
and
beasts
in
other
parts
of
esthonia
again
the
christmas
boar
as
it
is
called
is
baked
of
the
first
rye
cut
at
harvest
it
has
a
conical
shape
and
a
cross
is
impressed
on
it
with
a
pig
s
bone
or
a
key
or
three
dints
are
made
in
it
with
a
buckle
or
a
piece
of
charcoal
it
stands
with
a
light
beside
it
on
the
table
all
through
the
festal
season
on
new
year
s
day
and
epiphany
before
sunrise
a
little
of
the
cake
is
crumbled
with
salt
and
given
to
the
cattle
the
rest
is
kept
till
the
day
when
the
cattle
are
driven
out
to
pasture
for
the
first
time
in
spring
it
is
then
put
in
the
herdsman
s
bag
and
at
evening
is
divided
among
the
cattle
to
guard
them
from
magic
and
harm
in
some
places
the
christmas
boar
is
partaken
of
by
and
cattle
at
the
time
of
the
barley
sowing
for
the
purpose
of
thereby
producing
a
heavier
crop
on
the
animal
embodiments
of
the
so
much
for
the
animal
embodiments
of
the
as
they
are
presented
to
us
in
the
of
northern
europe
these
customs
bring
out
clearly
the
sacramental
character
of
the
the
is
conceived
as
embodied
in
an
animal
this
divine
animal
is
slain
and
its
flesh
and
blood
are
partaken
of
by
the
harvesters
thus
the
cock
the
goose
the
hare
the
cat
the
goat
and
the
ox
are
eaten
sacramentally
by
the
harvesters
and
the
pig
is
eaten
sacramentally
by
ploughmen
in
spring
again
as
a
substitute
for
the
real
flesh
of
the
divine
being
bread
or
dumplings
are
made
in
his
image
and
eaten
sacramentally
thus
dumplings
are
eaten
by
the
harvesters
and
loaves
made
in
the
yule
boar
are
eaten
in
spring
by
the
ploughman
and
his
cattle
the
reader
has
probably
remarked
the
complete
parallelism
between
the
conceptions
of
the
in
human
and
in
animal
form
the
parallel
may
be
here
briefly
resumed
when
the
corn
waves
in
the
wind
it
is
said
either
that
the
or
that
the
is
passing
through
the
corn
children
are
warned
against
straying
in
either
because
the
or
because
the
is
there
in
the
last
corn
cut
or
the
last
sheaf
threshed
either
the
or
the
is
supposed
to
be
present
the
last
sheaf
is
itself
called
either
the
or
the
and
is
made
up
in
the
shape
either
of
a
woman
or
of
a
wolf
etc
the
person
who
cuts
binds
or
threshes
the
last
sheaf
is
called
either
the
old
woman
or
the
wolf
according
to
the
name
bestowed
on
the
sheaf
itself
as
in
some
places
a
sheaf
made
in
human
form
and
called
the
maiden
the
mother
of
the
maize
is
kept
from
one
harvest
to
the
next
in
order
to
secure
a
continuance
of
the
s
blessing
so
in
some
places
the
and
in
others
the
flesh
of
the
goat
is
kept
for
a
similar
purpose
from
one
harvest
to
the
next
as
in
some
places
the
grain
taken
from
the
is
mixed
with
the
in
spring
to
make
the
crop
abundant
so
in
some
places
the
feathers
of
the
cock
and
in
sweden
the
yule
boar
are
kept
till
spring
and
mixed
with
the
for
a
like
purpose
as
part
of
the
or
maiden
is
given
to
the
cattle
at
christmas
or
to
the
horses
at
the
first
ploughing
so
part
of
the
yule
boar
is
given
to
the
ploughing
horses
or
oxen
in
spring
lastly
the
death
of
the
is
represented
by
killing
or
pretending
to
kill
either
his
human
or
his
animal
representative
and
the
worshippers
partake
sacramentally
either
of
the
actual
body
and
blood
of
the
representative
of
the
divinity
or
of
bread
made
in
his
likeness
other
animal
forms
assumed
by
the
are
the
stag
roe
sheep
bear
ass
mouse
stork
swan
and
kite
if
it
is
asked
why
the
should
be
thought
to
appear
in
the
form
of
an
animal
and
of
so
many
different
animals
we
may
reply
that
to
primitive
man
the
simple
appearance
of
an
animal
or
bird
among
the
corn
is
probably
enough
to
suggest
a
mysterious
link
between
the
creature
and
the
corn
and
when
we
remember
that
in
the
old
days
before
fields
were
fenced
in
all
kinds
of
animals
must
have
been
free
to
roam
over
them
we
need
not
wonder
that
the
should
have
been
identified
even
with
large
animals
like
the
horse
and
cow
which
nowadays
could
not
except
by
a
rare
accident
be
found
straying
in
an
english
this
explanation
applies
with
peculiar
force
to
the
very
common
case
in
which
the
animal
embodiment
of
the
is
believed
to
lurk
in
the
last
standing
corn
for
at
harvest
a
number
of
wild
animals
such
as
hares
rabbits
and
partridges
are
commonly
driven
by
the
progress
of
the
reaping
into
the
last
patch
of
standing
corn
and
make
their
escape
from
it
as
it
is
being
cut
down
so
regularly
does
this
happen
that
reapers
and
others
often
stand
round
the
last
patch
of
corn
armed
with
sticks
or
guns
with
which
they
kill
the
animals
as
they
dart
out
of
their
last
refuge
among
the
stalks
now
primitive
man
to
whom
magical
changes
of
shape
seem
perfectly
credible
finds
it
most
natural
that
the
spirit
of
the
corn
driven
from
his
home
in
the
ripe
grain
should
make
his
escape
in
the
form
of
the
animal
which
is
seen
to
rush
out
of
the
last
patch
of
corn
as
it
falls
under
the
scythe
of
the
reaper
thus
the
identification
of
the
with
an
animal
is
analogous
to
the
identification
of
him
with
a
passing
stranger
as
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
stranger
near
the
or
is
to
the
primitive
mind
enough
to
identify
him
as
the
spirit
of
the
corn
escaping
from
the
cut
or
threshed
corn
so
the
sudden
appearance
of
an
animal
issuing
from
the
cut
corn
is
enough
to
identify
it
with
the
escaping
from
his
ruined
home
the
two
identifications
are
so
analogous
that
they
can
hardly
be
dissociated
in
any
attempt
to
explain
them
those
who
look
to
some
other
principle
than
the
one
here
suggested
for
the
explanation
of
the
latter
identification
are
bound
to
shew
that
their
theory
covers
the
former
identification
also
note
the
pleiades
in
primitive
calendars
the
constellation
of
the
pleiades
plays
an
important
part
in
the
calendar
of
primitive
peoples
both
in
the
northern
and
in
the
southern
hemisphere
indeed
for
reasons
which
at
first
sight
are
not
obvious
savages
appear
to
have
paid
more
attention
to
this
constellation
than
to
any
other
group
of
stars
in
the
sky
and
in
particular
they
have
commonly
timed
the
various
operations
of
the
agricultural
year
by
observation
of
its
heliacal
rising
or
setting
some
evidence
on
the
subject
was
adduced
by
the
late
richard
andree
but
much
more
exists
and
it
may
be
worth
while
to
put
certain
of
the
facts
together
in
the
first
place
it
deserves
to
be
noticed
that
great
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
pleiades
by
savages
in
the
southern
hemisphere
who
do
not
till
the
ground
and
who
therefore
lack
that
incentive
to
observe
the
stars
which
is
possessed
by
peoples
in
the
agricultural
stage
of
society
for
we
can
scarcely
doubt
that
in
early
ages
the
practical
need
of
ascertaining
the
proper
seasons
for
sowing
and
planting
has
done
more
than
mere
speculative
curiosity
to
foster
a
knowledge
of
astronomy
by
compelling
savages
to
scrutinise
the
great
celestial
clock
for
indications
of
the
time
of
year
now
amongst
the
rudest
of
savages
known
to
us
are
the
australian
aborigines
none
of
whom
in
their
native
state
ever
practised
agriculture
yet
we
are
told
that
they
do
according
to
their
manner
worship
the
hosts
of
heaven
and
believe
particular
constellations
rule
natural
causes
for
such
they
have
names
and
sing
and
dance
to
gain
the
favour
of
the
pleiades
the
constellation
worshipped
by
one
body
as
the
giver
of
rain
but
if
it
should
be
deferred
instead
of
blessings
curses
are
apt
to
be
bestowed
upon
according
to
a
writer
whose
evidence
on
other
matters
of
australian
beliefs
is
open
to
grave
doubt
some
of
the
aborigines
of
new
south
wales
denied
that
the
sun
is
the
source
of
heat
because
he
shines
also
in
winter
when
the
weather
is
cold
the
real
cause
of
warm
weather
they
held
to
be
the
pleiades
because
as
the
summer
heat
increases
that
constellation
rises
higher
and
higher
in
the
sky
reaching
its
greatest
elevation
in
the
height
of
summer
and
gradually
sinking
again
in
autumn
as
the
days
grow
cooler
till
in
winter
it
is
either
barely
visible
or
lost
to
view
altogether
another
writer
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
natives
of
victoria
in
the
early
days
of
the
colony
and
whose
testimony
can
be
relied
upon
tells
us
that
an
old
chief
of
the
spring
creek
tribe
taught
the
young
people
the
names
of
the
favourite
planets
and
constellations
as
indications
of
the
seasons
for
example
when
canopus
is
a
very
little
above
the
horizon
in
the
east
at
daybreak
the
season
for
emu
eggs
has
come
when
the
pleiades
are
visible
in
the
east
an
hour
before
sunrise
the
time
for
visiting
friends
and
neighbouring
tribes
is
at
again
the
abipones
of
paraguay
who
neither
sowed
nor
reaped
nevertheless
regarded
the
pleiades
as
an
image
of
their
ancestor
as
that
constellation
is
invisible
in
the
sky
of
south
america
for
several
months
every
year
the
abipones
believed
that
their
ancestor
was
then
sick
and
they
were
dreadfully
afraid
that
he
would
die
but
when
the
constellation
reappeared
in
the
month
of
may
they
saluted
the
return
of
their
ancestor
with
joyous
shouts
and
the
glad
music
of
flutes
and
horns
and
they
congratulated
him
on
his
recovery
from
sickness
next
day
they
all
went
out
to
collect
wild
honey
from
which
they
brewed
a
favourite
beverage
then
at
sunset
they
feasted
and
kept
up
the
revelry
all
night
by
the
light
of
torches
while
a
sorceress
who
presided
at
the
festivity
shook
her
rattle
and
danced
but
the
proceedings
were
perfectly
decorous
the
sexes
did
not
mix
with
each
other
the
mocobis
of
paraguay
also
looked
upon
the
pleiades
as
their
father
and
creator
the
guaycurus
of
the
gran
chaco
used
to
rejoice
greatly
at
the
reappearance
of
the
pleiades
on
this
occasion
they
held
a
festival
at
which
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
all
beat
each
other
soundly
believing
that
this
brought
them
health
abundance
and
victory
over
their
enemies
amongst
the
lengua
indians
of
paraguay
at
the
present
day
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
is
connected
with
the
beginning
of
spring
and
feasts
are
held
at
this
time
generally
of
a
markedly
immoral
character
the
guaranis
of
paraguay
knew
the
time
of
sowing
by
observation
of
the
pleiades
they
are
said
to
have
revered
the
constellation
and
to
have
dated
the
beginning
of
their
year
from
the
rising
of
the
constellation
in
may
the
tapuiyas
formerly
a
numerous
and
warlike
tribe
of
brazil
hailed
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
with
great
respect
and
worshipped
the
constellation
with
songs
and
dances
the
indians
of
brazil
an
agricultural
people
who
subsist
mainly
by
the
cultivation
of
manioc
determine
the
time
for
their
various
field
labours
by
the
position
of
certain
constellations
especially
the
pleiades
when
that
constellation
has
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
the
regular
heavy
rains
set
in
the
omagua
indians
of
brazil
ascribe
to
the
pleiades
a
special
influence
on
human
destiny
a
brazilian
name
for
the
pleiades
is
that
is
mother
of
those
who
are
the
constellation
we
are
told
is
known
to
the
indians
of
the
whole
of
brasil
and
appears
to
be
even
worshipped
by
some
tribes
in
matto
grosso
in
the
valley
of
the
amazon
a
number
of
popular
sayings
are
current
about
it
thus
they
say
that
in
the
first
days
of
its
appearance
in
the
firmament
while
it
is
still
low
the
birds
and
especially
the
fowls
sleep
on
the
lower
branches
or
perches
and
that
just
as
it
rises
so
do
they
that
it
brings
much
cold
and
rain
that
when
the
constellation
vanishes
the
serpents
lose
their
venom
that
the
reeds
used
in
making
arrows
must
be
cut
before
the
appearance
of
the
pleiades
else
they
will
be
according
to
the
legend
the
pleiades
disappear
in
may
and
reappear
in
june
their
reappearance
coincides
with
the
renewal
of
vegetation
and
of
animal
life
hence
the
legend
relates
that
everything
which
appears
before
the
constellation
is
renewed
that
is
the
appearance
of
the
pleiades
marks
the
beginning
of
the
indians
of
the
orinoco
called
the
pleiades
or
according
to
their
dialect
and
they
dated
the
beginning
of
their
year
from
the
time
when
these
stars
are
visible
in
the
east
after
sunset
by
the
indians
of
peru
the
pleiades
were
called
the
in
this
constellation
the
peruvians
both
of
the
sierra
and
the
coast
beheld
the
prototype
of
their
cherished
stores
of
corn
it
made
their
maize
to
grow
and
was
worshipped
when
the
pleiades
appeared
above
the
horizon
on
or
about
corpus
christi
day
these
indians
celebrated
their
chief
festival
of
the
year
and
adored
the
constellation
in
order
that
the
maize
might
not
dry
adjoining
the
great
temple
of
the
sun
at
cuzco
there
was
a
cloister
with
halls
opening
off
it
one
of
these
halls
was
dedicated
to
the
moon
and
another
to
the
planet
venus
the
pleiades
and
all
the
other
stars
the
incas
venerated
the
pleiades
because
of
their
curious
position
and
the
symmetry
of
their
shape
the
tribes
of
vera
cruz
on
the
coast
of
mexico
dated
the
beginning
of
their
year
from
the
heliacal
setting
of
the
pleiades
which
in
the
latitude
of
vera
cruz
in
the
year
fell
on
the
first
of
may
of
the
gregorian
calendar
the
aztecs
appear
to
have
attached
great
importance
to
the
pleiades
for
they
timed
the
most
solemn
and
impressive
of
all
their
religious
ceremonies
so
as
to
coincide
with
the
moment
when
that
constellation
was
in
the
middle
of
the
sky
at
midnight
the
ceremony
consisted
in
kindling
a
sacred
new
fire
on
the
breast
of
a
human
victim
on
the
last
night
of
a
great
period
of
years
they
expected
that
at
the
close
of
one
of
these
periods
the
stars
would
cease
to
revolve
and
the
world
itself
would
come
to
an
end
hence
when
the
critical
moment
approached
the
priests
watched
from
the
top
of
a
mountain
the
movement
of
the
stars
and
especially
of
the
pleiades
with
the
utmost
anxiety
when
that
constellation
was
seen
to
cross
the
meridian
great
was
the
joy
for
they
knew
that
the
world
was
respited
for
another
years
immediately
the
bravest
and
handsomest
of
the
captives
was
thrown
down
on
his
back
a
board
of
dry
wood
was
placed
on
his
breast
and
one
of
the
priests
made
fire
by
twirling
a
stick
between
his
hands
on
the
board
as
soon
as
the
flame
burst
forth
the
breast
of
the
victim
was
cut
open
his
heart
was
torn
out
and
together
with
the
rest
of
his
body
was
thrown
into
the
fire
runners
carried
the
new
fire
at
full
speed
to
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
to
rekindle
the
cold
hearths
for
every
fire
throughout
the
country
had
been
extinguished
as
a
preparation
for
this
solemn
rite
the
blackfeet
indians
of
north
america
know
and
observe
the
pleiades
and
regulate
their
most
important
feast
by
those
stars
about
the
first
and
the
last
days
of
the
occultation
of
the
pleiades
there
is
a
sacred
feast
among
the
blackfeet
the
mode
of
observance
is
national
the
whole
of
the
tribe
turning
out
for
the
celebration
of
its
rites
which
include
two
sacred
vigils
the
solemn
blessing
and
planting
of
the
seed
it
is
the
opening
of
the
agricultural
season
in
all
highly
religious
feasts
the
calumet
or
pipe
is
always
presented
towards
the
pleiades
with
invocation
for
goods
the
women
swear
by
the
pleiades
as
the
men
do
by
the
sun
or
the
morning
at
the
general
meeting
of
the
nation
there
is
a
dance
of
warriors
which
is
supposed
to
represent
the
dance
of
the
seven
young
men
who
are
identified
with
the
pleiades
for
the
indians
say
that
the
seven
stars
of
the
constellation
were
seven
brothers
who
guarded
by
night
the
field
of
sacred
seed
and
danced
round
it
to
keep
themselves
awake
during
the
long
hours
of
darkness
according
to
another
legend
told
by
the
blackfeet
the
pleiades
are
six
children
who
were
so
ashamed
because
they
had
no
little
yellow
hides
of
buffalo
calves
that
they
wandered
away
on
the
plains
and
were
at
last
taken
up
into
the
sky
they
are
not
seen
during
the
moon
when
the
buffalo
calves
are
yellow
spring
the
time
of
their
shame
but
every
year
when
the
calves
turn
brown
autumn
the
lost
children
can
be
seen
in
the
sky
every
this
version
of
the
myth
it
will
be
observed
recognises
only
six
stars
in
the
constellation
and
many
savages
apparently
see
no
more
which
speaks
ill
for
the
keenness
of
their
vision
since
among
ourselves
persons
endowed
with
unusually
good
sight
are
able
i
understand
to
discern
seven
among
the
pueblo
indians
of
tusayan
an
ancient
province
of
arizona
the
culmination
of
the
pleiades
is
often
used
to
determine
the
proper
time
for
beginning
a
sacred
nocturnal
rite
especially
an
invocation
addressed
to
the
six
deities
who
are
believed
to
rule
the
six
quarters
of
the
world
the
writer
who
records
this
fact
adds
i
can
not
explain
its
significance
and
why
of
all
stellar
objects
this
minute
cluster
of
stars
of
a
low
magnitude
is
more
important
than
other
stellar
groups
is
not
clear
to
if
the
pueblo
indians
see
only
six
stars
in
the
cluster
as
to
which
i
can
not
speak
it
might
seem
to
them
a
reason
for
assigning
one
of
the
stars
to
each
of
the
six
quarters
namely
north
south
east
west
above
and
below
the
society
islanders
in
the
south
pacific
divided
the
year
into
two
seasons
which
they
determined
by
observation
of
the
pleiades
the
first
they
called
i
pleiades
above
it
commenced
when
in
the
evening
these
stars
appeared
on
or
near
the
horizon
and
the
half
year
during
which
immediately
after
sunset
they
were
seen
above
the
horizon
was
called
i
the
other
season
commenced
when
at
sunset
the
stars
were
invisible
and
continued
until
at
that
hour
they
appeared
again
above
the
horizon
this
season
was
called
i
pleiades
in
the
hervey
islands
of
the
south
pacific
it
is
said
that
the
constellation
was
originally
a
single
star
which
was
shattered
into
six
fragments
by
the
god
tane
this
cluster
of
little
stars
is
appropriately
named
or
on
account
of
their
brightness
it
is
also
designated
or
on
account
of
the
apparent
number
of
the
fragments
the
presence
of
the
seventh
star
not
having
been
detected
by
the
unassisted
native
among
these
islanders
the
arrival
of
the
new
year
was
indicated
by
the
appearance
of
the
constellation
on
the
eastern
horizon
just
after
sunset
that
is
about
the
middle
of
december
hence
the
idolatrous
worship
paid
to
this
beautiful
cluster
of
stars
in
many
of
the
south
sea
islands
the
pleiades
were
worshipped
at
danger
island
and
at
the
penrhyns
down
to
the
introduction
of
christianity
in
in
many
islands
extravagant
joy
is
still
manifested
at
the
rising
of
this
constellation
out
of
the
for
example
in
manahiki
or
humphrey
s
island
south
pacific
when
the
constellation
pleiades
was
seen
there
was
unusual
joy
all
over
the
month
and
expressed
by
singing
dancing
and
so
the
maoris
of
new
zealand
another
polynesian
people
of
the
south
pacific
divided
the
year
into
moons
and
determined
the
first
moon
by
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
which
they
called
indeed
throughout
polynesia
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
variously
known
as
matariki
mataliki
matalii
makalii
etc
seems
to
have
marked
the
beginning
of
the
year
among
some
of
the
melanesians
also
the
pleiades
occupy
an
important
position
in
the
calendar
the
banks
islanders
and
northern
new
hebrides
people
content
themselves
with
distinguishing
the
pleiades
by
which
the
approach
of
yam
harvest
is
amongst
the
constellations
the
pleiades
and
orion
s
belt
seem
to
be
those
which
are
most
familiar
to
the
natives
of
bougainville
straits
the
former
which
they
speak
of
as
possessing
six
stars
they
name
the
latter
they
have
also
names
for
a
few
other
stars
as
in
the
case
of
many
other
savage
races
the
pleiades
is
a
constellation
of
great
significance
with
the
inhabitants
of
these
straits
the
treasury
islanders
hold
a
great
feast
towards
the
end
of
october
to
celebrate
as
far
as
i
could
learn
the
approaching
appearance
of
the
constellation
above
the
eastern
horizon
soon
after
sunset
probably
as
in
many
of
the
pacific
islands
this
event
marks
the
beginning
of
their
year
i
learned
from
stephens
that
in
ugi
where
of
all
the
constellations
the
pleiades
alone
receives
a
name
the
natives
are
guided
by
it
in
selecting
the
times
for
planting
and
taking
up
the
the
natives
of
the
torres
straits
islands
observe
the
appearance
of
the
pleiades
on
the
horizon
at
sunset
and
when
they
see
it
they
say
that
the
new
yam
time
has
come
the
kai
and
the
bukaua
two
agricultural
tribes
of
german
new
guinea
also
determine
the
season
of
their
labour
in
the
fields
by
observation
of
the
pleiades
the
kai
say
that
the
time
for
such
labours
is
when
the
pleiades
are
visible
above
the
horizon
at
night
in
some
districts
of
northern
celebes
the
are
similarly
prepared
for
cultivation
when
the
pleiades
are
seen
at
a
certain
height
above
the
horizon
as
to
the
dyaks
of
sarawak
we
read
that
the
pleiades
themselves
tell
them
when
to
farm
and
according
to
their
position
in
the
heavens
morning
and
evening
do
they
cut
down
the
forest
burn
plant
and
reap
the
malays
are
obliged
to
follow
their
example
or
their
lunar
year
would
soon
render
their
farming
operations
when
the
season
for
clearing
fresh
land
in
the
forest
approaches
a
wise
man
is
appointed
to
go
out
before
dawn
and
watch
for
the
pleiades
as
soon
as
the
constellation
is
seen
to
rise
while
it
is
yet
dark
they
know
that
the
time
has
come
to
begin
but
not
until
the
pleiades
are
at
the
zenith
before
dawn
do
the
dyaks
think
it
desirable
to
burn
the
fallen
timber
and
to
sow
the
rice
however
the
kenyahs
and
kayans
two
other
tribes
of
sarawak
determine
the
agricultural
seasons
by
observation
of
the
sun
rather
than
of
the
stars
and
for
this
purpose
they
have
devised
certain
simple
but
ingenious
mechanisms
the
kenyahs
measure
the
length
of
the
shadow
cast
by
an
upright

when

sets

line
with
two
upright
stones
in
bali
an
island
to
the
east
of
java
the
appearance
of
the
pleiades
at
sunset
in
march
marks
the
end
of
the
year
the
pleiades
and
orion
are
the
only
constellations
which
the
people
of
bali
observe
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
their
lunar
calendar
by
intercalation
for
example
they
bring
the
lunar
year
into
harmony
with
the
solar
by
prolonging
the
month
asada
until
the
pleiades
are
visible
at
sunset
the
natives
of
nias
an
island
to
the
south
of
sumatra
pay
little
heed
to
the
stars
but
they
have
names
for
the
morning
star
and
for
the
pleiades
and
when
the
pleiades
appear
in
the
sky
the
people
assemble
to
till
their
fields
for
they
think
that
to
do
so
before
the
rising
of
the
constellation
would
be
useless
in
some
districts
of
sumatra
much
confusion
in
regard
to
the
period
of
sowing
is
said
to
have
arisen
from
a
very
extraordinary
cause
anciently
say
the
natives
it
was
regulated
by
the
stars
and
particularly
by
the
appearance
heliacal
rising
of
the
or
pleiades
but
after
the
introduction
of
the
mahometan
religion
they
were
induced
to
follow
the
returns
of
the
or
great
annual
fast
and
forgot
their
old
rules
the
consequence
of
this
was
obvious
for
the
lunar
year
of
the
being
eleven
days
short
of
the
sidereal
or
solar
year
the
order
of
the
seasons
was
soon
inverted
and
it
is
only
astonishing
that
its
inaptness
to
the
purposes
of
agriculture
should
not
have
been
immediately
the
battas
or
bataks
of
central
sumatra
date
the
various
operations
of
the
agricultural
year
by
the
positions
of
orion
and
the
pleiades
when
the
pleiades
rise
before
the
sun
at
the
beginning
of
july
the
achinese
of
northern
sumatra
know
that
the
time
has
come
to
sow
the
rice
scattered
and
fragmentary
as
these
notices
are
they
suffice
to
shew
that
the
pleiades
have
received
much
attention
from
savages
in
the
tropical
regions
of
the
world
from
brasil
in
the
east
to
sumatra
in
the
west
far
to
the
north
of
the
tropics
the
rude
kamchatkans
are
said
to
know
only
three
constellations
the
great
bear
the
pleiades
and
three
stars
in
orion
when
we
pass
to
africa
we
again
find
the
pleiades
employed
by
tribes
in
various
parts
of
the
continent
to
mark
the
seasons
of
the
agricultural
year
we
have
seen
that
the
caffres
of
south
africa
date
their
new
year
from
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
just
before
sunrise
and
fix
the
time
for
sowing
by
observation
of
that
constellation
they
calculate
only
twelve
lunar
months
for
the
year
for
which
they
have
descriptive
names
and
this
results
in
frequent
confusion
and
difference
of
opinion
as
to
which
month
it
really
is
the
confusion
is
always
rectified
by
the
first
appearance
of
pleiades
just
before
sunrise
and
a
fresh
start
is
made
and
things
go
on
smoothly
till
once
more
the
moons
get
out
of
place
and
reference
has
again
to
be
made
to
the
according
to
another
authority
on
the
bantu
tribes
of
south
africa
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
shortly
after
sunset
was
regarded
as
indicating
the
planting
season
to
this
constellation
as
well
as
to
several
of
the
prominent
stars
and
planets
they
gave
expressive
names
they
formed
no
theories
concerning
the
nature
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
their
motions
and
were
not
given
to
thinking
of
such
the
amazulu
call
the
pleiades
which
means
the
stars
because
when
the
pleiades
appear
the
people
begin
to
dig
they
say
that
the
pleiades
dies
and
is
not
seen
it
is
not
seen
in
winter
and
at
last
when
the
winter
is
coming
to
an
end
it
begins
to
of
its
stars
first
and
then
three
until
going
on
increasing
it
becomes
a
cluster
of
stars
and
is
perfectly
clear
when
the
sun
is
about
to
rise
and
we
say
is
renewed
and
the
year
is
renewed
and
so
we
begin
to
the
bechuanas
are
directed
by
the
position
of
certain
stars
in
the
heavens
that
the
time
has
arrived
in
the
revolving
year
when
particular
roots
can
be
dug
up
for
use
or
when
they
may
commence
their
labours
of
the
field
this
is
their
turnings
or
revolvings
or
what
we
should
call
the
spring
time
of
the
year
the
pleiades
they
call
which
may
be
translated
cultivator
or
the
precursor
of
agriculture
from
the
relative
verb
to
cultivate
and
a
pronominal
prefix
distinguishing
them
as
the
actors
thus
when
this
constellation
assumes
a
certain
position
in
the
heavens
it
is
the
signal
to
commence
cultivating
their
fields
and
among
some
of
these
south
african
tribes
the
period
of
seclusion
observed
by
lads
after
circumcision
comes
to
an
end
with
the
appearance
of
the
pleiades
and
accordingly
the
youths
are
said
to
long
as
ardently
for
the
rising
of
the
constellation
as
mohammedans
for
the
rising
of
the
moon
which
will
put
an
end
to
the
fast
of
ramadan
the
hottentots
date
the
seasons
of
the
year
by
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
pleiades
an
early
moravian
missionary
settled
among
the
hottentots
reports
that
at
the
return
of
the
pleiades
these
natives
celebrate
an
anniversary
as
soon
as
these
stars
appear
above
the
eastern
horizon
mothers
will
lift
their
little
ones
on
their
arms
and
running
up
to
elevated
spots
will
show
to
them
those
friendly
stars
and
teach
them
to
stretch
their
little
hands
towards
them
the
people
of
a
kraal
will
assemble
to
dance
and
to
sing
according
to
the
old
custom
of
their
ancestors
the
chorus
always
sings
o
tiqua
our
father
above
our
heads
give
rain
to
us
that
the
fruits
bulbs
etc
may
ripen
and
that
we
may
have
plenty
of
food
send
us
a
good
with
some
tribes
of
british
central
africa
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
early
in
the
evening
is
the
signal
for
the
hoeing
to
begin
to
the
masai
of
east
africa
the
appearance
of
the
pleiades
in
the
wrest
is
the
sign
of
the
beginning
of
the
rainy
season
which
takes
its
name
from
the
constellation
in
masailand
the
pleiades
are
above
the
horizon
from
september
till
about
the
seventeenth
of
may
and
the
people
as
they
express
it
themselves
know
whether
it
will
rain
or
not
according
to
the
appearance
or
of
the
six
stars
called
the
pleiades
which
follow
after
one
another
like
cattle
when
the
month
which
the
masai
call
of
the
pleiades
arrives
and
the
pleiades
are
no
longer
visible
they
know
that
the
rains
are
over
for
the
pleiades
set
in
that
month
and
are
not
seen
again
until
the
season
of
showers
has
come
to
an
end
it
is
then
that
they
the
only
other
groups
of
stars
for
which
the
masai
appear
to
have
names
are
orion
s
sword
and
orion
s
belt
the
nandi
of
british
east
africa
have
a
special
name
for
the
pleiades
and
it
is
by
the
appearance
or
of
these
stars
that
the
nandi
know
whether
they
may
expect
a
good
or
a
bad
the
kikuyu
of
the
same
region
say
that
the
pleiades
is
the
mark
in
the
heavens
to
show
the
people
when
to
plant
their
crops
they
plant
when
this
constellation
is
in
a
certain
position
early
in
the
in
sierra
leone
the
proper
time
for
preparing
the
plantations
is
shewn
by
the
particular
situation
in
which
the
pleiades
called
by
the
bulloms
the
only
stars
which
they
observe
or
distinguish
by
peculiar
names
are
to
be
seen
at
we
have
seen
that
ancient
greek
farmers
reaped
their
corn
when
the
pleiades
rose
at
sunrise
in
may
and
that
they
ploughed
their
fields
when
the
constellation
set
at
sunrise
in
november
the
interval
between
the
two
dates
is
about
six
months
both
the
greeks
and
the
romans
dated
the
beginning
of
summer
from
the
heliacal
rising
of
the
pleiades
and
the
beginning
of
winter
from
their
heliacal
setting
pliny
regarded
the
autumnal
setting
of
the
pleiades
as
the
proper
season
for
sowing
the
corn
particularly
the
wheat
and
the
barley
and
he
tells
us
that
in
greece
and
asia
all
the
crops
were
sown
at
the
setting
of
that
constellation
so
widespread
over
the
world
has
been
and
is
the
association
of
the
pleiades
with
agriculture
especially
with
the
sowing
or
planting
of
the
crops
the
reason
for
the
association
seems
to
be
the
coincidence
of
the
rising
or
setting
of
the
constellation
with
the
commencement
of
the
rainy
season
since
men
must
very
soon
have
learned
that
the
best
if
not
the
only
season
to
sow
and
plant
is
the
time
of
year
when
the
seeds
or
roots
will
be
quickened
by
abundant
showers
the
same
association
of
the
pleiades
with
rain
seems
sufficient
to
explain
their
importance
even
for
savages
who
do
not
till
the
ground
for
ignorant
though
such
races
are
they
yet
can
hardly
fail
to
observe
that
wild
fruits
grow
more
plentifully
and
therefore
that
they
themselves
have
more
to
eat
after
a
heavy
fall
of
rain
than
after
a
long
drought
in
point
of
fact
we
saw
that
some
of
the
australian
aborigines
who
are
wholly
ignorant
of
agriculture
look
on
the
pleiades
as
the
givers
of
rain
and
curse
the
constellation
if
its
appearance
is
not
followed
by
the
expected
showers
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale
of
culture
the
civilised
greeks
similarly
supposed
that
the
autumnal
setting
of
the
pleiades
was
the
cause
of
the
rains
which
followed
it
and
the
astronomical
writer
geminus
thought
it
worth
while
to
argue
against
the
supposition
pointing
out
that
the
vicissitudes
of
the
weather
and
of
the
seasons
though
they
may
coincide
with
the
risings
and
settings
of
the
constellations
are
not
produced
by
them
the
stars
being
too
distant
from
the
earth
to
exercise
any
appreciable
influence
on
our
atmosphere
hence
he
says
though
the
constellations
serve
as
the
signals
they
must
not
be
regarded
as
the
causes
of
atmospheric
changes
and
he
aptly
illustrates
the
distinction
by
a
reference
to
which
are
the
signals

the

the

was
originally
a
magical
ceremony
to
ensure

than
merely
a
mode
of
divination

those
which
are

which

of

stalks

of

last

writer
tells

were
the
principal
and
were
revered
by
the
natives
as
mothers
of
the
maize
similarly
when
two
potatoes
were
found
growing
together

called
them
and
kept
them
in

to
get
a
good
crop

not
as
a
