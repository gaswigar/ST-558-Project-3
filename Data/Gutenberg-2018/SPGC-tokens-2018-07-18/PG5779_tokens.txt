chapter
i
his
name
was
yura
he
was
six
years
old
and
the
world
was
to
him
enormous
alive
and
bewitchingly
mysterious
he
knew
the
sky
quite
well
he
knew
its
deep
azure
by
day
and
the
half
silvery
half
golden
clouds
slowly
floating
by
he
often
watched
them
as
he
lay
on
his
back
upon
the
grass
or
upon
the
roof
but
he
did
not
know
the
stars
so
well
for
he
went
to
bed
early
he
knew
well
and
remembered
only
one
star
the
green
bright
and
very
attentive
star
that
rises
in
the
pale
sky
just
before
you
go
to
bed
and
that
seemed
to
be
the
only
star
so
large
in
the
whole
sky
but
best
of
all
he
knew
the
earth
in
the
yard
in
the
street
and
in
the
garden
with
all
its
inexhaustible
wealth
of
stones
of
velvety
grass
of
hot
sand
and
of
that
wonderfully
varied
mysterious
and
delightful
dust
which
grown
people
did
not
notice
at
all
from
the
height
of
their
enormous
size
and
in
falling
asleep
as
the
last
bright
image
of
the
passing
day
he
took
along
to
his
dreams
a
bit
of
hot
rubbed
off
stone
bathed
in
sunshine
or
a
thick
layer
of
tenderly
tickling
burning
dust
when
he
went
with
his
mother
to
the
centre
of
the
city
along
the
large
streets
he
remembered
best
of
all
upon
his
return
the
wide
flat
stones
upon
which
his
steps
and
his
feet
seemed
terribly
small
like
two
little
boats
and
even
the
multitude
of
revolving
wheels
and
horses
heads
did
not
impress
themselves
so
clearly
upon
his
memory
as
this
new
and
unusually
interesting
appearance
of
the
ground
everything
was
enormous
to
him
the
fences
the
dogs
and
the
people
but
that
did
not
at
all
surprise
or
frighten
him
that
only
made
everything
particularly
interesting
that
transformed
life
into
an
uninterrupted
miracle
according
to
his
measures
various
objects
seemed
to
him
as
follows
his
father
ten
yards
tall
his
mother
three
yards
the
neighbour
s
angry
dog
thirty
yards
their
own
dog
ten
yards
like
papa
their
house
of
one
story
was
very
very
tall
a
mile
the
distance
between
one
side
of
the
street
and
the
other
two
miles
their
garden
and
the
trees
in
their
garden
seemed
immense
infinitely
tall
the
city
a
million
just
how
much
he
did
not
know
and
everything
else
appeared
to
him
in
the
same
way
he
knew
many
people
large
and
small
but
he
knew
and
appreciated
better
the
little
ones
with
whom
he
could
speak
of
everything
the
grown
people
behaved
so
foolishly
and
asked
such
absurd
dull
questions
about
things
that
everybody
knew
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
also
to
make
believe
that
he
was
foolish
he
had
to
lisp
and
give
nonsensical
answers
and
of
course
he
felt
like
running
away
from
them
as
soon
as
possible
but
there
were
over
him
and
around
him
and
within
him
two
entirely
extraordinary
persons
at
once
big
and
small
wise
and
foolish
at
once
his
own
and
strangers
his
father
and
mother
they
must
have
been
very
good
people
otherwise
they
could
not
have
been
his
father
and
mother
at
any
rate
they
were
charming
and
unlike
other
people
he
could
say
with
certainty
that
his
father
was
very
great
terribly
wise
that
he
possessed
immense
power
which
made
him
a
person
to
be
feared
somewhat
and
it
was
interesting
to
talk
with
him
about
unusual
things
placing
his
hand
in
father
s
large
strong
warm
hand
for
safety
s
sake
mamma
was
not
so
large
and
sometimes
she
was
even
very
small
she
was
very
kind
hearted
she
kissed
tenderly
she
understood
very
well
how
he
felt
when
he
had
a
pain
in
his
little
stomach
and
only
with
her
could
he
relieve
his
heart
when
he
grew
tired
of
life
of
his
games
or
when
he
was
the
victim
of
some
cruel
injustice
and
if
it
was
unpleasant
to
cry
in
father
s
presence
and
even
dangerous
to
be
capricious
his
tears
had
an
unusually
pleasant
taste
in
mother
s
presence
and
filled
his
soul
with
a
peculiar
serene
sadness
which
he
could
find
neither
in
his
games
nor
in
laughter
nor
even
in
the
reading
of
the
most
terrible
fairy
tales
it
should
be
added
that
mamma
was
a
beautiful
woman
and
that
everybody
was
in
love
with
her
that
was
good
for
he
felt
proud
of
it
but
that
was
also
bad
for
he
feared
that
she
might
be
taken
away
and
every
time
one
of
the
men
one
of
those
enormous
invariably
inimical
men
who
were
busy
with
themselves
looked
at
mamma
fixedly
for
a
long
time
yura
felt
bored
and
uneasy
he
felt
like
stationing
himself
between
him
and
mamma
and
no
matter
where
he
went
to
attend
to
his
own
affairs
something
was
drawing
him
back
sometimes
mamma
would
utter
a
bad
terrifying
phrase
why
are
you
forever
staying
around
here
go
and
play
in
your
own
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
go
away
he
would
take
a
book
along
or
he
would
sit
down
to
draw
but
that
did
not
always
help
him
sometimes
mamma
would
praise
him
for
reading
but
sometimes
she
would
say
again
you
had
better
go
to
your
own
room
yurochka
you
see
you
ve
spilt
water
on
the
tablecloth
again
you
always
do
some
mischief
with
your
and
then
she
would
reproach
him
for
being
perverse
but
he
felt
worst
of
all
when
a
dangerous
and
suspicious
guest
would
come
when
yura
had
to
go
to
bed
but
when
he
lay
down
in
his
bed
a
sense
of
easiness
came
over
him
and
he
felt
as
though
all
was
ended
the
lights
went
out
life
stopped
everything
slept
in
all
such
cases
with
suspicious
men
yura
felt
vaguely
but
very
strongly
that
he
was
replacing
father
in
some
way
and
that
made
him
somewhat
like
a
grown
man
he
was
in
a
bad
frame
of
mind
like
a
grown
person
but
therefore
he
was
unusually
calculating
wise
and
serious
of
course
he
said
nothing
about
this
to
any
one
for
no
one
would
understand
him
but
by
the
manner
in
which
he
caressed
father
when
he
arrived
and
sat
down
on
his
knees
patronisingly
one
could
see
in
the
boy
a
man
who
fulfilled
his
duty
to
the
end
at
times
father
could
not
understand
him
and
would
simply
send
him
away
to
play
or
to
sleep
yura
never
felt
offended
and
went
away
with
a
feeling
of
great
satisfaction
he
did
not
feel
the
need
of
being
understood
he
even
feared
it
at
times
he
would
not
tell
under
any
circumstances
why
he
was
crying
at
times
he
would
make
believe
that
he
was
absent
minded
that
he
heard
nothing
that
he
was
occupied
with
his
own
affairs
but
he
heard
and
understood
and
he
had
a
terrible
secret
he
had
noticed
that
these
extraordinary
and
charming
people
father
and
mother
were
sometimes
unhappy
and
were
hiding
this
from
everybody
therefore
he
was
also
concealing
his
discovery
and
gave
everybody
the
impression
that
all
was
well
many
times
he
found
mamma
crying
somewhere
in
a
corner
in
the
drawing
room
or
in
the
bedroom
his
own
room
was
next
to
her
bedroom
and
one
night
very
late
almost
at
dawn
he
heard
the
terribly
loud
and
angry
voice
of
father
and
the
weeping
voice
of
mother
he
lay
a
long
time
holding
his
breath
but
then
he
was
so
terrified
by
that
unusual
conversation
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
he
asked
his
nurse
in
a
soft
voice
what
are
they
saying
and
the
nurse
answered
quickly
in
a
whisper
sleep
sleep
they
are
not
saying
i
am
coming
over
to
your
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
such
a
big
boy
i
am
coming
over
to
your
thus
terribly
afraid
lest
they
should
be
heard
they
spoke
in
whispers
and
argued
in
the
dark
and
the
end
was
that
yura
moved
over
to
nurse
s
bed
upon
her
rough
but
cosy
and
warm
blanket
in
the
morning
papa
and
mamma
were
very
cheerful
and
yura
pretended
that
he
believed
them
and
it
seemed
that
he
really
did
believe
them
but
that
same
evening
and
perhaps
it
was
another
evening
he
noticed
his
father
crying
it
happened
in
the
following
way
he
was
passing
his
father
s
study
and
the
door
was
half
open
he
heard
a
noise
and
he
looked
in
quietly
father
lay
face
downward
upon
his
couch
and
cried
aloud
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
yura
went
away
turned
about
in
his
room
and
came
back
the
door
was
still
half
open
no
one
but
father
was
in
the
room
and
he
was
still
sobbing
if
he
cried
quietly
yura
could
understand
it
but
he
sobbed
loudly
he
moaned
in
a
heavy
voice
and
his
teeth
were
gnashing
terribly
he
lay
there
covering
the
entire
couch
hiding
his
head
under
his
broad
shoulders
sniffing
heavily
and
that
was
beyond
his
understanding
and
on
the
table
on
the
large
table
covered
with
pencils
papers
and
a
wealth
of
other
things
stood
the
lamp
burning
with
a
red
flame
and
smoking
a
flat
greyish
black
strip
of
smoke
was
coming
out
and
bending
in
all
directions
suddenly
father
heaved
a
loud
sigh
and
stirred
yura
walked
away
quietly
and
then
all
was
the
same
as
ever
no
one
would
have
learned
of
this
but
the
image
of
the
enormous
mysterious
and
charming
man
who
was
his
father
and
who
was
crying
remained
in
yura
s
memory
as
something
dreadful
and
extremely
serious
and
if
there
were
things
of
which
he
did
not
feel
like
speaking
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
say
nothing
of
this
as
though
it
were
something
sacred
and
terrible
and
in
that
silence
he
must
love
father
all
the
more
but
he
must
love
so
that
father
should
not
notice
it
and
he
must
give
the
impression
that
it
is
very
jolly
to
live
on
earth
and
yura
succeeded
in
accomplishing
all
this
father
did
not
notice
that
he
loved
him
in
a
special
manner
and
it
was
really
jolly
to
live
on
earth
so
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
make
believe
the
threads
of
his
soul
stretched
themselves
to
all
to
the
sun
to
the
knife
and
the
cane
he
was
peeling
to
the
beautiful
and
enigmatic
distance
which
he
saw
from
the
top
of
the
iron
roof
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
separate
himself
from
all
that
was
not
himself
when
the
grass
had
a
strong
and
fragrant
odour
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
had
such
a
fragrant
odour
and
when
he
lay
down
in
his
bed
however
strange
it
may
seem
together
with
him
in
his
little
bed
lay
down
the
enormous
yard
the
street
the
slant
threads
of
the
rain
and
the
muddy
pools
and
the
whole
enormous
live
fascinating
mysterious
world
thus
all
fell
asleep
with
him
and
thus
all
awakened
with
him
and
together
with
him
they
all
opened
their
eyes
and
there
was
one
striking
fact
worthy
of
the
profoundest
reflection
if
he
placed
a
stick
somewhere
in
the
garden
in
the
evening
it
was
there
also
in
the
morning
and
the
which
he
hid
in
a
box
in
the
barn
remained
there
although
it
was
dark
and
he
went
to
his
room
for
the
night
because
of
this
he
felt
a
natural
need
for
hiding
under
his
pillow
all
that
was
most
valuable
to
him
since
things
stood
or
lay
there
alone
they
might
also
disappear
of
their
accord
he
reasoned
and
in
general
it
was
so
wonderful
and
pleasant
that
the
nurse
and
the
house
and
the
sun
existed
not
only
yesterday
but
every
day
he
felt
like
laughing
and
singing
aloud
when
he
awoke
when
people
asked
him
what
his
name
was
he
answered
promptly
but
some
people
were
not
satisfied
with
this
alone
and
they
wanted
to
know
his
full
name
and
then
he
replied
with
a
certain
effort
yura
and
after
a
moment
s
thought
he
added
yura
mikhailovich
chapter
ii
an
unusual
day
arrived
it
was
mother
s
birthday
guests
were
expected
in
the
evening
military
music
was
to
play
and
in
the
garden
and
upon
the
terrace
lanterns
were
to
burn
and
yura
need
not
go
to
bed
at
o
clock
but
could
stay
up
as
late
as
he
liked
yura
got
up
when
all
were
still
sleeping
he
dressed
himself
and
jumped
out
quickly
with
the
expectation
of
miracles
but
he
was
unpleasantly
surprised
the
rooms
were
in
the
same
disorder
as
usual
in
the
morning
the
cook
and
the
chambermaid
were
still
sleeping
and
the
door
was
closed
with
a
hook
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
the
people
would
stir
and
commence
to
run
about
and
that
the
rooms
would
assume
a
holiday
appearance
and
he
feared
for
the
fate
of
the
festival
it
was
still
worse
in
the
garden
the
paths
were
not
swept
and
there
was
not
a
single
lantern
there
he
grew
very
uneasy
fortunately
yevmen
the
coachman
was
washing
the
carriage
behind
the
barn
in
the
back
yard
and
though
he
had
done
this
frequently
before
and
though
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
his
appearance
yura
clearly
felt
something
of
the
holiday
in
the
decisive
way
in
which
the
coachman
splashed
the
water
from
the
bucket
with
his
sinewy
arms
on
which
the
sleeves
of
his
red
blouse
were
rolled
up
to
his
elbows
yevmen
only
glanced
askance
at
yura
and
suddenly
yura
seemed
to
have
noticed
for
the
first
time
his
broad
black
wavy
beard
and
thought
respectfully
that
yevmen
was
a
very
worthy
man
he
said
good
morning
then
all
moved
very
rapidly
suddenly
the
janitor
appeared
and
started
to
sweep
the
paths
suddenly
the
window
in
the
kitchen
was
thrown
open
and
women
s
voices
were
heard
chattering
suddenly
the
chambermaid
rushed
out
with
a
little
rug
and
started
to
beat
it
with
a
stick
as
though
it
were
a
dog
all
commenced
to
stir
and
the
events
starting
simultaneously
in
different
places
rushed
with
such
mad
swiftness
that
it
was
impossible
to
catch
up
with
them
while
the
nurse
was
giving
yura
his
tea
people
were
beginning
to
hang
up
the
wires
for
the
lanterns
in
the
garden
and
while
the
wires
were
being
stretched
in
the
garden
the
furniture
was
rearranged
completely
in
the
drawing
room
and
while
the
furniture
was
rearranged
in
the
drawing
room
yevmen
the
coachman
harnessed
the
horse
and
drove
out
of
the
yard
with
a
certain
special
mysterious
mission
yura
succeeded
in
concentrating
himself
for
some
time
with
the
greatest
difficulty
together
with
father
he
was
hanging
up
the
lanterns
and
father
was
charming
he
laughed
jested
put
yura
on
the
ladder
he
himself
climbed
the
thin
creaking
rungs
of
the
ladder
and
finally
both
fell
down
together
with
the
ladder
upon
the
grass
but
they
were
not
hurt
yura
jumped
up
while
father
remained
lying
on
the
grass
hands
thrown
back
under
his
head
looking
with
eyes
at
the
shining
infinite
azure
of
the
sky
thus
lying
on
the
grass
with
a
serious
expression
on
his
face
apparently
not
in
the
mood
for
play
father
looked
very
much
like
gulliver
longing
for
his
land
of
giants
yura
recalled
something
unpleasant
but
to
cheer
his
father
up
he
sat
down
astride
upon
his
knees
and
said
do
you
remember
father
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
used
to
sit
down
on
your
knees
and
you
used
to
shake
me
like
a
horse
but
before
he
had
time
to
finish
he
lay
with
his
nose
on
the
grass
he
was
lifted
in
the
air
and
thrown
down
with
force
father
had
thrown
him
high
up
with
his
knees
according
to
his
old
habit
yura
felt
offended
but
father
entirely
ignoring
his
anger
began
to
tickle
him
under
his
armpits
so
that
yura
had
to
laugh
against
his
will
and
then
father
picked
him
up
like
a
little
pig
by
the
legs
and
carried
him
to
the
terrace
and
mamma
was
frightened
what
are
you
doing
the
blood
will
rush
to
his
head
after
which
yura
found
himself
standing
on
his
legs
red
faced
dishevelled
feeling
very
miserable
and
terribly
happy
at
the
same
time
the
day
was
rushing
fast
like
a
cat
that
is
chased
by
a
dog
like
forerunners
of
the
coming
great
festival
certain
messengers
appeared
with
notes
wonderfully
tasty
cakes
were
brought
the
dressmaker
came
and
locked
herself
in
with
mamma
in
the
bedroom
then
two
gentlemen
arrived
then
another
gentleman
then
a
lady
evidently
the
entire
city
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
yura
examined
the
messengers
as
though
they
were
strange
people
from
another
world
and
walked
before
them
with
an
air
of
importance
as
the
son
of
the
lady
whose
birthday
was
to
be
celebrated
he
met
the
gentlemen
he
escorted
the
cakes
and
toward
midday
he
was
so
exhausted
that
he
suddenly
started
to
despise
life
he
quarrelled
with
the
nurse
and
lay
down
in
his
bed
face
downward
in
order
to
have
his
revenge
on
her
but
he
fell
asleep
immediately
he
awoke
with
the
same
feeling
of
hatred
for
life
and
a
desire
for
revenge
but
after
having
looked
at
things
with
his
eyes
which
he
washed
with
cold
water
he
felt
that
both
the
world
and
life
were
so
fascinating
that
they
were
even
funny
when
they
dressed
yura
in
a
red
silk
rustling
blouse
and
he
thus
clearly
became
part
of
the
festival
and
he
found
on
the
terrace
a
long
snow
white
table
glittering
with
glass
dishes
he
again
commenced
to
spin
about
in
the
whirlpool
of
the
onrushing
events
the
musicians
have
arrived
the
musicians
have
arrived
he
cried
looking
for
father
or
mother
or
for
any
one
who
would
treat
the
arrival
of
the
musicians
with
proper
seriousness
father
and
mother
were
sitting
in
the
garden
in
the
arbour
which
was
thickly
surrounded
with
wild
grapes
maintaining
silence
the
beautiful
head
of
mother
lay
on
father
s
shoulder
although
father
embraced
her
he
seemed
very
serious
and
he
showed
no
enthusiasm
when
he
was
told
of
the
arrival
of
the
musicians
both
treated
their
arrival
with
inexplicable
indifference
which
called
forth
a
feeling
of
sadness
in
yura
but
mamma
stirred
and
said
let
me
go
i
must
remember
said
father
referring
to
something
yura
did
not
understand
but
which
resounded
in
his
heart
with
a
light
gnawing
alarm
stop
aren
t
you
ashamed
mother
laughed
and
this
laughter
made
yura
feel
still
more
alarmed
especially
since
father
did
not
laugh
but
maintained
the
same
serious
and
mournful
appearance
of
gulliver
pining
for
his
native
land
but
soon
all
this
was
forgotten
for
the
wonderful
festival
had
begun
in
all
its
glory
mystery
and
grandeur
the
guests
came
fast
and
there
was
no
longer
any
place
at
the
white
table
which
had
been
deserted
but
a
while
before
voices
resounded
and
laughter
and
merry
jests
and
the
music
began
to
play
and
on
the
deserted
paths
of
the
garden
where
but
a
while
ago
yura
had
wandered
alone
imagining
himself
a
prince
in
quest
of
the
sleeping
princess
now
appeared
people
with
cigarettes
and
with
loud
free
speech
yura
met
the
first
guests
at
the
front
entrance
he
looked
at
each
one
carefully
and
he
made
the
acquaintance
and
even
the
friendship
of
some
of
them
on
the
way
from
the
corridor
to
the
table
thus
he
managed
to
become
friendly
with
the
officer
whose
name
was
mitenka
a
grown
man
whose
name
was
mitenka
he
said
so
himself
mitenka
had
a
heavy
leather
sword
which
was
as
cold
as
a
snake
which
could
not
be
taken
out
but
mitenka
lied
the
sword
was
only
fastened
at
the
handle
with
a
silver
cord
but
it
could
be
taken
out
very
nicely
and
yura
felt
vexed
because
the
stupid
mitenka
instead
of
carrying
his
sword
as
he
always
did
placed
it
in
a
corner
in
the
hallway
as
a
cane
but
even
in
the
corner
the
sword
stood
out
alone
one
could
see
at
once
that
it
was
a
sword
another
thing
that
displeased
yura
was
that
another
officer
came
with
mitenka
an
officer
whom
yura
knew
and
whose
name
was
also
yura
mikhailovich
yura
thought
that
the
officer
must
have
been
named
so
for
fun
that
wrong
yura
mikhailovich
had
visited
them
several
times
he
even
came
once
on
horseback
but
most
of
the
time
he
came
just
before
little
yura
had
to
go
to
bed
and
little
yura
went
to
bed
while
the
unreal
yura
mikhailovich
remained
with
mamma
and
that
caused
him
to
feel
alarmed
and
sad
he
was
afraid
that
mamma
might
be
deceived
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
real
yura
mikhailovich
and
now
walking
beside
mitenka
he
did
not
seem
to
realise
his
guilt
he
adjusted
his
moustaches
and
maintained
silence
he
kissed
mamma
s
hand
and
that
seemed
repulsive
to
little
yura
but
the
stupid
mitenka
also
kissed
mamma
s
hand
and
thereby
set
everything
aright
but
soon
the
guests
arrived
in
such
numbers
and
there
was
such
a
variety
of
them
as
if
they
had
fallen
straight
from
the
sky
and
some
of
them
seemed
to
have
fallen
near
the
table
while
others
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
the
garden
suddenly
several
students
and
ladies
appeared
in
the
path
the
ladies
were
ordinary
but
the
students
had
holes
cut
at
the
left
side
of
their
white
coats
for
their
swords
but
they
did
not
bring
their
swords
along
no
doubt
because
of
their
pride
they
were
all
very
proud
and
the
ladies
rushed
over
to
yura
and
began
to
kiss
him
then
the
most
beautiful
of
the
ladies
whose
name
was
ninochka
took
yura
to
the
swing
and
swung
him
until
she
threw
him
down
he
hurt
his
left
leg
near
the
knee
very
painfully
and
even
stained
his
little
white
pants
in
that
spot
but
of
course
he
did
not
cry
and
somehow
his
pain
had
quickly
disappeared
somewhere
at
this
time
father
was
leading
an
old
man
in
the
garden
and
he
asked
yurochka
did
you
get
hurt
but
as
the
old
man
also
smiled
and
also
spoke
yurochka
did
not
kiss
father
and
did
not
even
answer
him
but
suddenly
he
seemed
to
have
lost
his
mind
he
commenced
to
squeal
for
joy
and
to
run
around
if
he
had
a
bell
as
large
as
the
whole
city
he
would
have
rung
that
bell
but
as
he
had
no
such
bell
he
climbed
the
linden
tree
which
stood
near
the
terrace
and
began
to
show
off
the
guests
below
were
laughing
and
mamma
was
shouting
and
suddenly
the
music
began
to
play
and
yura
soon
stood
in
front
of
the
orchestra
spreading
his
legs
apart
and
according
to
his
old
but
long
forgotten
habit
put
his
finger
into
his
mouth
the
sounds
seemed
to
strike
at
him
all
at
once
they
roared
and
thundered
they
made
his
legs
tingle
and
they
shook
his
jaw
they
played
so
loudly
that
there
was
nothing
but
the
orchestra
on
the
whole
earth
everything
else
had
vanished
the
brass
ends
of
some
of
the
trumpets
even
spread
apart
and
opened
wide
from
the
great
roaring
yura
thought
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
make
a
military
helmet
out
of
such
a
trumpet
suddenly
yura
grew
sad
the
music
was
still
roaring
but
now
it
was
somewhere
far
away
while
within
him
all
became
quiet
and
it
was
growing
ever
more
and
more
quiet
heaving
a
deep
sigh
yura
looked
at
the
sky
it
was
so
high
and
with
slow
footsteps
he
started
out
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
holiday
of
all
its
confused
boundaries
possibilities
and
distances
and
everywhere
he
turned
out
to
be
too
late
he
wanted
to
see
how
the
tables
for
card
playing
would
be
arranged
but
the
tables
were
ready
and
people
had
been
playing
cards
for
a
long
time
when
he
came
up
he
touched
the
chalk
and
the
brush
near
his
father
and
his
father
immediately
chased
him
away
what
of
that
what
difference
did
that
make
to
him
he
wanted
to
see
how
they
would
start
to
dance
and
he
was
sure
that
they
would
dance
in
the
parlour
but
they
had
already
commenced
to
dance
not
in
the
parlour
but
under
the
linden
trees
he
wanted
to
see
how
they
would
light
the
lanterns
but
the
lanterns
had
all
been
lit
already
every
one
of
them
to
the
very
last
of
the
last
they
lit
up
of
themselves
like
stars
mamma
danced
best
of
all
chapter
iii
night
arrived
in
the
form
of
red
green
and
yellow
lanterns
while
there
were
no
lanterns
there
was
no
night
and
now
it
lay
everywhere
it
crawled
into
the
bushes
it
covered
the
entire
garden
with
darkness
as
with
water
and
it
covered
the
sky
everything
looked
as
beautiful
as
the
very
best
fairy
tale
with
coloured
pictures
at
one
place
the
house
had
disappeared
entirely
only
the
square
window
made
of
red
light
remained
and
the
chimney
of
the
house
was
visible
and
there
a
certain
spark
glistened
looked
down
and
seemed
to
think
of
its
own
affairs
what
affairs
do
chimneys
have
various
affairs
of
the
people
in
the
garden
only
their
voices
remained
as
long
as
some
one
walked
near
the
lanterns
he
could
be
seen
but
as
soon
as
he
walked
away
all
seemed
to
melt
melt
melt
and
the
voice
above
the
ground
laughed
talked
floating
fearlessly
in
the
darkness
but
the
officers
and
the
students
could
be
seen
even
in
the
dark
a
white
spot
and
above
it
a
small
light
of
a
cigarette
and
a
big
voice
and
now
the
most
joyous
thing
commenced
for
yura
the
fairy
tale
the
people
and
the
festival
and
the
lanterns
remained
on
earth
while
he
soared
away
transformed
into
air
melting
in
the
night
like
a
grain
of
dust
the
great
mystery
of
the
night
became
his
mystery
and
his
little
heart
yearned
for
still
more
mystery
in
its
solitude
his
heart
yearned
for
the
fusion
of
life
and
death
that
was
yura
s
second
madness
that
evening
he
became
invisible
although
he
could
enter
the
kitchen
as
others
did
he
climbed
with
difficulty
upon
the
roof
of
the
cellar
over
which
the
kitchen
window
was
flooded
with
light
and
he
looked
in
there
people
were
roasting
something
busying
themselves
and
did
not
know
that
he
was
looking
at
them
and
yet
he
saw
everything
then
he
went
away
and
looked
at
papa
s
and
mamma
s
bedroom
the
room
was
empty
but
the
beds
had
already
been
made
for
the
night
and
a
little
image
lamp
was
burning
he
saw
that
then
he
looked
into
his
own
room
his
own
bed
was
also
ready
waiting
for
him
he
passed
the
room
where
they
were
playing
cards
also
as
an
invisible
being
holding
his
breath
and
stepping
so
lightly
as
though
he
were
soaring
in
the
air
only
when
he
reached
the
garden
in
the
dark
he
drew
a
proper
breath
then
he
resumed
his
quest
he
came
over
to
people
who
were
talking
so
near
him
that
he
could
touch
them
with
his
hand
and
yet
they
did
not
know
that
he
was
there
and
they
continued
to
speak
undisturbed
he
watched
ninochka
for
a
long
time
until
he
learned
all
her
life
he
was
almost
trapped
ninochka
even
exclaimed
yurochka
is
that
you
he
lay
down
behind
a
bush
and
held
his
breath
thus
ninochka
was
deceived
and
she
had
almost
caught
him
to
make
things
more
mysterious
he
started
to
crawl
instead
of
walk
now
the
alleys
seemed
full
of
danger
thus
a
long
time
went
by
according
to
his
own
calculations
at
the
time
ten
years
went
by
and
he
was
still
hiding
and
going
ever
farther
away
from
the
people
and
thus
he
went
so
far
that
he
was
seized
with
dread
between
him
and
the
past
when
he
was
walking
like
everybody
else
an
abyss
was
formed
over
which
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
to
cross
now
he
would
have
come
out
into
the
light
but
he
was
afraid
it
was
impossible
all
was
lost
and
the
music
was
still
playing
and
everybody
had
forgotten
him
even
mamma
he
was
alone
there
was
a
breath
of
cold
from
the
dewy
grass
the
gooseberry
bush
scratched
him
the
darkness
could
not
be
pierced
with
his
eyes
and
there
was
no
end
to
it
o
lord
without
any
definite
plan
in
a
state
of
utter
despair
yura
now
crawled
toward
a
mysterious
faintly
blinking
light
fortunately
it
turned
out
to
be
the
same
arbour
which
was
covered
with
wild
grapes
and
in
which
father
and
mother
had
sat
that
day
he
did
not
recognise
it
at
first
yes
it
was
the
same
arbour
the
lights
of
the
lanterns
everywhere
had
gone
out
and
only
two
were
still
burning
a
yellow
little
lantern
was
still
burning
brightly
and
the
other
a
yellow
one
too
was
already
beginning
to
blink
and
though
there
was
no
wind
that
lantern
quivered
from
its
own
blinking
and
everything
seemed
to
quiver
slightly
yura
was
about
to
get
up
to
go
into
the
arbour
and
there
begin
life
anew
with
an
imperceptible
transition
from
the
old
when
suddenly
he
heard
voices
in
the
arbour
his
mother
and
the
wrong
yura
mikhailovich
the
officer
were
talking
the
right
yura
grew
petrified
in
his
place
his
heart
stood
still
and
his
breathing
ceased
mamma
said
stop
you
have
lost
your
mind
somebody
may
come
in
yura
mikhailovich
said
and
you
mamma
said
i
am
years
old
i
am
old
yura
mikhailovich
said
he
does
not
know
anything
is
it
possible
that
he
does
not
know
anything
he
does
not
even
suspect
listen
does
he
shake
everybody
s
hand
so
firmly
mamma
said
what
a
question
of
course
he
does
that
is
no
not
yura
mikhailovich
said
i
feel
sorry
for
mamma
said
for
him
and
she
laughed
strangely
yurochka
understood
that
they
were
talking
of
him
of
yurochka
but
what
did
it
all
mean
o
lord
and
why
did
she
laugh
yura
mikhailovich
said
where
are
you
going
i
will
not
let
you
mamma
said
you
offend
me
let
me
go
no
you
have
no
right
to
kiss
me
let
me
go
they
became
silent
now
yurochka
looked
through
the
leaves
and
saw
that
the
officer
embraced
and
kissed
mamma
then
they
spoke
of
something
but
he
understood
nothing
he
heard
nothing
he
suddenly
forgot
the
meaning
of
words
and
he
even
forgot
the
words
which
he
knew
and
used
before
he
remembered
but
one
word
mamma
and
he
whispered
it
uninterruptedly
with
his
dry
lips
but
that
word
sounded
so
terrible
more
terrible
than
anything
and
in
order
not
to
exclaim
it
against
his
will
yura
covered
his
mouth
with
both
hands
one
upon
the
other
and
thus
remained
until
the
officer
and
mamma
went
out
of
the
arbour
when
yura
came
into
the
room
where
the
people
were
playing
cards
the
serious
man
was
scolding
papa
for
something
brandishing
the
chalk
talking
shouting
saying
that
father
did
not
act
as
he
should
have
acted
that
what
he
had
done
was
impossible
that
only
bad
people
did
such
things
that
the
old
man
would
never
again
play
with
father
and
so
on
and
father
was
smiling
waving
his
hands
attempting
to
say
something
but
the
old
man
would
not
let
him
and
he
commenced
to
shout
more
loudly
and
the
old
man
was
a
little
fellow
while
father
was
big
handsome
and
tall
and
his
smile
was
sad
like
that
of
gulliver
pining
for
his
native
land
of
tall
and
handsome
people
of
course
he
must
conceal
from
him
of
course
he
must
conceal
from
him
that
which
happened
in
the
arbour
and
he
must
love
him
and
he
felt
that
he
loved
him
so
much
and
with
a
wild
cry
yura
rushed
over
to
the
old
man
and
began
to
beat
him
with
his
fists
with
all
his
strength
don
t
you
dare
insult
him
don
t
you
dare
insult
him
o
lord
what
has
happened
some
one
laughed
some
one
shouted
father
caught
yura
in
his
arms
pressed
him
closely
causing
him
pain
and
cried
where
is
mother
call
then
yura
was
seized
with
a
whirlwind
of
frantic
tears
of
desperate
sobs
and
mortal
anguish
but
through
his
frantic
tears
he
looked
at
his
father
to
see
whether
he
had
guessed
it
and
when
mother
came
in
he
started
to
shout
louder
in
order
to
divert
any
suspicion
but
he
did
not
go
to
her
arms
he
clung
more
closely
to
father
so
that
father
had
to
carry
him
into
his
room
but
it
seemed
that
he
himself
did
not
want
to
part
with
yura
as
soon
as
he
carried
him
out
of
the
room
where
the
guests
were
he
began
to
kiss
him
and
he
repeated
oh
my
dearest
oh
my
dearest
and
he
said
to
mamma
who
walked
behind
him
just
think
of
the
boy
mamma
said
that
is
all
due
to
your
whist
you
were
scolding
each
other
so
that
the
child
was
father
began
to
laugh
and
answered
yes
he
does
scold
harshly
but
yura
oh
what
a
dear
boy
in
his
room
yura
demanded
that
father
himself
undress
him
now
you
are
getting
cranky
said
father
i
don
t
know
how
to
do
it
let
mamma
undress
but
you
stay
mamma
had
deft
fingers
and
she
undressed
him
quickly
and
while
she
was
removing
his
clothes
yura
held
father
by
the
hand
he
ordered
the
nurse
out
of
the
room
but
as
father
was
beginning
to
grow
angry
and
he
might
guess
what
had
happened
in
the
arbour
decided
to
let
him
go
but
while
kissing
him
he
said
cunningly
he
will
not
scold
you
any
more
will
he
papa
smiled
then
he
laughed
kissed
yura
once
more
and
said
no
no
and
if
he
does
i
will
throw
him
across
the
please
do
said
yura
you
can
do
it
you
are
so
yes
i
am
pretty
strong
but
you
had
better
sleep
mamma
will
stay
here
with
you
a
mamma
said
i
will
send
the
nurse
in
i
must
attend
to
the
father
shouted
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
that
you
can
stay
a
while
with
the
but
mamma
insisted
we
have
guests
we
can
t
leave
them
that
but
father
looked
at
her
steadfastly
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
mamma
decided
to
stay
very
well
then
i
ll
stay
here
but
see
that
maria
does
not
mix
up
the
usually
it
was
thus
when
mamma
sat
near
yura
as
he
was
falling
asleep
she
held
his
hand
until
the
last
moment
that
is
what
she
usually
did
but
now
she
sat
as
though
she
were
all
alone
as
though
yura
her
son
who
was
falling
asleep
was
not
there
at
all
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looked
into
the
distance
to
attract
her
attention
yura
stirred
but
mamma
said
briefly
and
she
continued
to
look
but
when
yura
s
eyes
had
grown
heavy
and
he
was
falling
asleep
with
all
his
sorrow
and
his
tears
mamma
suddenly
went
down
on
her
knees
before
the
little
bed
and
kissed
yura
firmly
many
many
times
but
her
kisses
were
wet
hot
and
wet
why
are
your
kisses
wet
are
you
crying
muttered
yura
yes
i
am
you
must
not
very
well
i
won
t
answered
mother
submissively
and
again
she
kissed
him
firmly
firmly
frequently
frequently
yura
lifted
both
hands
with
a
heavy
movement
clasped
his
mother
around
the
neck
and
pressed
his
burning
cheek
firmly
to
her
wet
and
cold
cheek
she
was
his
mother
after
all
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
how
painful
how
bitterly
painful
a
story
which
will
never
be
finished
exhausted
with
the
painful
uncertainty
of
the
day
i
fell
asleep
dressed
on
my
bed
suddenly
my
wife
aroused
me
in
her
hand
a
candle
was
flickering
which
appeared
to
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
as
bright
as
the
sun
and
behind
the
candle
her
chin
too
was
trembling
and
enormous
unfamiliar
dark
eyes
stared
motionlessly
do
you
know
she
said
do
you
know
they
are
building
barricades
on
our
street
it
was
quiet
we
looked
straight
into
each
other
s
eyes
and
i
felt
my
face
turning
pale
life
vanished
somewhere
and
then
returned
again
with
a
loud
throbbing
of
the
heart
it
was
quiet
and
the
flame
of
the
candle
was
quivering
and
it
was
small
dull
but
like
a
crooked
sword
are
you
afraid
i
asked
the
pale
chin
trembled
but
her
eyes
remained
motionless
and
looked
at
me
without
blinking
and
only
now
i
noticed
what
unfamiliar
what
terrible
eyes
they
were
for
ten
years
i
had
looked
into
them
and
had
known
them
better
than
my
own
eyes
and
now
there
was
something
new
in
them
which
i
am
unable
define
i
would
have
called
it
pride
but
there
was
something
different
in
them
something
new
entirely
new
i
took
her
hand
it
was
cold
she
grasped
my
hand
firmly
and
there
was
something
new
something
i
had
not
known
before
in
her
handclasp
she
had
never
before
clasped
my
hand
as
she
did
this
time
how
long
i
asked
about
an
hour
already
your
brother
has
gone
away
he
was
apparently
afraid
that
you
would
not
let
him
go
so
he
went
away
quietly
but
i
saw
it
was
true
then
the
time
had
arrived
i
rose
and
for
some
reason
spent
a
long
time
washing
myself
as
was
my
wont
in
the
morning
before
going
to
work
and
my
wife
held
the
light
then
we
put
out
the
light
and
walked
over
to
the
window
overlooking
the
street
it
was
spring
it
was
may
and
the
air
that
came
in
from
the
open
window
was
such
as
we
had
never
before
felt
in
that
old
large
city
for
several
days
the
factories
and
the
roads
had
been
idle
and
the
air
free
from
smoke
was
filled
with
the
fragrance
of
the
fields
and
the
flowering
gardens
perhaps
with
that
of
the
dew
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
that
smells
so
wonderfully
on
spring
nights
when
i
go
out
far
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
city
not
a
lantern
not
a
carriage
not
a
single
sound
of
the
city
over
the
unconcerned
stony
surface
if
you
had
closed
your
eyes
you
would
really
have
thought
that
you
were
in
a
village
there
a
dog
was
barking
i
had
never
before
heard
a
dog
barking
in
the
city
and
i
laughed
for
happiness
listen
a
dog
is
my
wife
embraced
me
and
said
it
is
there
on
the
we
bent
over
the
and
there
in
the
transparent
dark
depth
we
saw
some
movement
not
people
but
movement
something
was
moving
about
like
a
shadow
suddenly
the
blows
of
a
hatchet
or
a
hammer
resounded
they
sounded
so
cheerful
so
resonant
as
in
a
forest
as
on
a
river
when
you
are
mending
a
boat
or
building
a
dam
and
in
the
presentiment
of
cheerful
harmonious
work
i
firmly
embraced
my
wife
while
she
looked
above
the
houses
above
the
roofs
looked
at
the
young
crescent
of
the
moon
which
was
already
setting
the
moon
was
so
young
so
strange
even
as
a
young
girl
who
is
dreaming
and
is
afraid
to
tell
her
dreams
and
it
was
shining
only
for
itself
when
will
we
have
a
full
moon
you
must
not
you
must
not
my
wife
interrupted
you
must
not
speak
of
that
which
will
be
what
for
it
is
afraid
of
words
come
it
was
dark
in
the
room
and
we
were
silent
for
a
long
time
without
seeing
each
other
yet
thinking
of
the
same
thing
and
when
i
started
to
speak
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
one
else
was
speaking
i
was
not
afraid
yet
the
voice
of
the
other
one
was
hoarse
as
though
suffocating
for
thirst
what
shall
it
be
and
they
you
will
be
with
them
it
will
be
enough
for
them
to
have
a
mother
i
can
not
and
i
can
i
i
know
that
she
did
not
stir
from
her
place
but
i
felt
distinctly
that
she
was
going
away
that
she
was
far
far
away
i
began
to
feel
so
cold
i
stretched
out
my
hands
but
she
pushed
them
aside
people
have
such
a
holiday
once
in
a
hundred
years
and
you
want
to
deprive
me
of
it
why
she
said
but
they
may
kill
you
there
and
our
children
will
life
will
be
merciful
to
me
but
even
if
they
should
perish
and
this
was
said
by
her
my
wife
a
woman
with
whom
i
had
lived
for
ten
years
but
yesterday
she
had
known
nothing
except
our
children
and
had
been
filled
with
fear
for
them
but
yesterday
she
had
caught
with
terror
the
stern
symptoms
of
the
future
what
had
come
over
her
yesterday
but
i
too
forgot
everything
that
was
yesterday
do
you
want
to
go
with
me
do
not
be
angry
she
thought
that
i
was
afraid
angry
don
t
be
angry
when
they
began
to
knock
here
and
you
were
still
sleeping
i
suddenly
understood
that
my
husband
my
children
all
these
were
simply
temporary
i
love
you
very
much
she
found
my
hand
and
shook
it
with
the
same
new
unfamiliar
grasp
but
do
you
hear
how
they
are
knocking
there
they
are
knocking
and
something
seems
to
be
falling
some
kind
of
walls
seem
to
be
falling
and
it
is
so
spacious
so
wide
so
free
it
is
night
now
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sun
is
shining
i
am
thirty
years
of
age
and
i
am
old
already
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
only
seventeen
and
that
i
love
some
one
with
my
first
love
a
great
boundless
what
a
night
i
said
it
is
as
if
the
city
were
no
more
you
are
right
i
have
also
forgotten
how
old
i
they
are
knocking
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
music
like
singing
of
which
i
have
always
dreamed
all
my
life
and
i
did
not
know
whom
it
was
that
i
loved
with
such
a
boundless
love
which
made
me
feel
like
crying
and
laughing
and
singing
there
is
freedom
do
not
take
my
happiness
away
let
me
die
with
those
who
are
working
there
who
are
calling
the
future
so
bravely
and
who
are
rousing
the
dead
past
from
its
there
is
no
such
thing
as
what
do
you
say
there
is
no
such
thing
as
time
who
are
you
i
did
not
know
you
are
you
a
human
being
she
burst
into
such
ringing
laughter
as
though
she
were
really
only
seventeen
years
old
i
did
not
know
you
either
are
you
too
a
human
being
how
strange
and
how
beautiful
it
is
a
human
being
that
which
i
am
writing
happened
long
ago
and
those
who
are
sleeping
now
in
the
sleep
of
grey
life
and
who
die
without
awakening
those
will
not
believe
me
in
those
days
there
was
no
such
thing
as
time
the
sun
was
rising
and
setting
and
the
hand
was
moving
around
the
dial
but
time
did
not
exist
and
many
other
great
and
wonderful
things
happened
in
those
days
and
those
who
are
sleeping
now
the
sleep
of
this
grey
life
and
who
die
without
awakening
will
not
believe
me
i
must
go
said
i
wait
i
will
give
you
something
to
eat
you
haven
t
eaten
anything
see
how
sensible
i
am
i
shall
go
i
shall
give
the
children
away
and
find
comrade
said
i
yes
through
the
open
windows
came
the
breath
of
the
fields
and
silence
and
from
time
to
time
the
cheerful
strokes
of
the
axe
and
i
sat
by
the
table
and
looked
and
listened
and
everything
was
so
mysteriously
new
that
i
felt
like
laughing
i
looked
at
the
walls
and
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
transparent
as
if
embracing
all
eternity
with
one
glance
i
saw
how
all
these
walls
had
been
built
i
saw
how
they
were
being
destroyed
and
i
alone
always
was
and
always
will
be
everything
will
pass
but
i
shall
remain
and
everything
seemed
to
me
strange
and
queer
so
unnatural
the
table
and
the
food
upon
it
and
everything
outside
of
me
it
all
seemed
to
me
transparent
and
light
existing
only
temporarily
why
don
t
you
eat
asked
my
wife
i
smiled
bread
it
is
so
she
glanced
at
the
bread
at
the
stale
dry
crust
of
bread
and
for
some
reason
her
face
became
sad
still
continuing
to
look
at
it
she
silently
adjusted
her
apron
with
her
hands
and
her
head
turned
slightly
very
slightly
in
the
direction
where
the
children
were
sleeping
do
you
feel
sorry
for
them
i
asked
she
shook
her
head
without
removing
her
eyes
from
the
bread
no
but
i
was
thinking
of
what
happened
in
our
life
how
incomprehensible
as
one
who
awakens
from
a
long
sleep
she
surveyed
the
room
with
her
eyes
and
all
seemed
to
her
so
incomprehensible
was
this
the
place
where
we
had
lived
you
were
my
and
there
are
our
here
beyond
the
wall
your
father
yes
he
died
he
died
without
the
smallest
child
frightened
at
something
in
her
sleep
began
to
cry
and
this
simple
childish
cry
apparently
demanding
something
sounded
so
strange
amid
these
phantom
walls
while
there
below
people
were
building
barricades
she
cried
and
demanded
caresses
certain
queer
words
and
promises
to
soothe
her
and
she
soon
was
soothed
well
go
said
my
wife
in
a
whisper
i
should
like
to
kiss
i
am
afraid
you
will
wake
them
no
i
will
it
turned
out
that
the
oldest
child
was
awake
he
had
heard
and
understood
everything
he
was
but
nine
years
old
but
he
understood
everything
he
met
me
with
a
deep
stern
look
will
you
take
your
gun
he
asked
thoughtfully
and
earnestly
i
it
is
behind
the
how
do
you
know
well
kiss
me
will
you
remember
me
he
jumped
up
in
his
bed
in
his
short
little
shirt
hot
from
sleep
and
firmly
clasped
my
neck
his
arms
were
burning
they
were
so
soft
and
delicate
i
lifted
his
hair
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
kissed
his
little
neck
will
they
kill
you
he
whispered
right
into
my
ear
no
i
will
come
but
why
did
he
not
cry
he
had
cried
sometimes
when
i
had
simply
left
the
house
for
a
while
is
it
possible
that
it
had
reached
him
too
who
knows
so
many
strange
things
happened
during
the
great
days
i
looked
at
the
walls
at
the
bread
at
the
candle
at
the
flame
which
had
kept
flickering
and
took
my
wife
by
the
hand
well
till
we
meet
again
yes
till
we
meet
again
that
was
all
i
went
out
it
was
dark
on
the
stairway
and
there
was
the
odour
of
old
filth
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
stones
and
the
darkness
groping
down
the
stairs
i
was
seized
with
a
tremendous
powerful
and
feeling
of
the
new
unknown
and
joyous
something
to
which
i
was
going
on
the
day
of
the
crucifixion
on
that
terrible
day
when
the
universal
injustice
was
committed
and
jesus
christ
was
crucified
in
golgotha
among
robbers
on
that
day
from
early
morning
a
tradesman
of
jerusalem
suffered
from
an
unendurable
toothache
his
toothache
had
commenced
on
the
day
before
toward
evening
at
first
his
right
jaw
started
to
pain
him
and
one
tooth
the
one
right
next
the
wisdom
tooth
seemed
to
have
risen
somewhat
and
when
his
tongue
touched
the
tooth
he
felt
a
slightly
painful
sensation
after
supper
however
his
toothache
had
passed
and
had
forgotten
all
about
it
he
had
made
a
profitable
deal
on
that
day
had
bartered
an
old
donkey
for
a
young
strong
one
so
he
was
very
cheerful
and
paid
no
heed
to
any
ominous
signs
and
he
slept
very
soundly
but
just
before
daybreak
something
began
to
disturb
him
as
if
some
one
were
calling
him
on
a
very
important
matter
and
when
awoke
angrily
his
teeth
were
aching
aching
openly
and
maliciously
causing
him
an
acute
drilling
pain
and
he
could
no
longer
understand
whether
it
was
only
the
same
tooth
that
had
ached
on
the
previous
day
or
whether
others
had
joined
that
tooth
s
entire
mouth
and
his
head
were
filled
with
terrible
sensations
of
pain
as
though
he
had
been
forced
to
chew
thousands
of
sharp
nails
he
took
some
water
into
his
mouth
from
an
earthen
jug
for
a
minute
the
acuteness
of
the
pain
subsided
his
teeth
twitched
and
swayed
like
a
wave
and
this
sensation
was
even
pleasant
as
compared
with
the
other
lay
down
again
recalled
his
new
donkey
and
thought
how
happy
he
would
have
been
if
not
for
his
toothache
and
he
wanted
to
fall
asleep
but
the
water
was
warm
and
five
minutes
later
his
toothache
began
to
rage
more
severely
than
ever
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
swayed
back
and
forth
like
a
pendulum
his
face
became
wrinkled
and
seemed
to
have
shrunk
and
a
drop
of
cold
perspiration
was
hanging
on
his
nose
which
had
turned
pale
from
his
sufferings
thus
swaying
back
and
forth
and
groaning
for
pain
he
met
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
which
was
destined
to
see
golgotha
and
the
three
crosses
and
grow
dim
from
horror
and
sorrow
was
a
good
and
kind
man
who
hated
any
injustice
but
when
his
wife
awoke
he
said
many
unpleasant
things
to
her
opening
his
mouth
with
difficulty
and
he
complained
that
he
was
left
alone
like
a
jackal
to
groan
and
writhe
for
pain
his
wife
met
the
undeserved
reproaches
patiently
for
she
knew
that
they
came
not
from
an
angry
heart
and
she
brought
him
numerous
good
remedies
rats
litter
to
be
applied
to
his
cheek
some
strong
liquid
in
which
a
scorpion
was
preserved
and
a
real
chip
of
the
tablets
that
moses
had
broken
he
began
to
feel
a
little
better
from
the
rats
litter
but
not
for
long
also
from
the
liquid
and
the
stone
but
the
pain
returned
each
time
with
renewed
intensity
during
the
moments
of
rest
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
of
the
little
donkey
and
he
dreamed
of
him
and
when
he
felt
worse
he
moaned
scolded
his
wife
and
threatened
to
dash
his
head
against
a
rock
if
the
pain
should
not
subside
he
kept
pacing
back
and
forth
on
the
flat
roof
of
his
house
from
one
corner
to
the
other
feeling
ashamed
to
come
close
to
the
side
facing
the
street
for
his
head
was
tied
around
with
a
kerchief
like
that
of
a
woman
several
times
children
came
running
to
him
and
told
him
hastily
about
jesus
of
nazareth
paused
listened
to
them
for
a
while
his
face
wrinkled
but
then
he
stamped
his
foot
angrily
and
chased
them
away
he
was
a
kind
man
and
he
loved
children
but
now
he
was
angry
at
them
for
bothering
him
with
trifles
it
was
disagreeable
to
him
that
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
in
the
street
and
on
the
neighbouring
roofs
doing
nothing
and
looking
curiously
at
who
had
his
head
tied
around
with
a
kerchief
like
a
woman
he
was
about
to
go
down
when
his
wife
said
to
him
look
they
are
leading
robbers
there
perhaps
that
will
divert
let
me
alone
don
t
you
see
how
i
am
suffering
answered
angrily
but
there
was
a
vague
promise
in
his
wife
s
words
that
there
might
be
a
relief
for
his
toothache
so
he
walked
over
to
the
parapet
unwillingly
bending
his
head
on
one
side
closing
one
eye
and
supporting
his
cheek
with
his
hand
his
face
assumed
a
squeamish
weeping
expression
and
he
looked
down
to
the
street
on
the
narrow
street
going
uphill
an
enormous
crowd
was
moving
forward
in
disorder
covered
with
dust
and
shouting
uninterruptedly
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
walked
the
criminals
bending
down
under
the
weight
of
their
crosses
and
over
them
the
scourges
of
the
roman
soldiers
were
wriggling
about
like
black
snakes
one
of
the
men
he
of
the
long
light
hair
in
a
torn
cloak
stumbled
over
a
stone
which
was
thrown
under
his
feet
and
he
fell
the
shouting
grew
louder
and
the
crowd
like
coloured
sea
water
closed
in
about
the
man
on
the
ground
suddenly
shuddered
for
pain
he
felt
as
though
some
one
had
pierced
a
needle
into
his
tooth
and
turned
it
there
he
groaned
and
walked
away
from
the
parapet
angry
and
squeamishly
indifferent
how
they
are
shouting
he
said
enviously
picturing
to
himself
their
mouths
with
strong
healthy
teeth
and
how
he
himself
would
have
shouted
if
he
had
been
well
this
intensified
his
toothache
and
he
shook
his
muffled
head
frequently
and
roared
they
say
that
he
restored
sight
to
the
blind
said
his
wife
who
remained
standing
at
the
parapet
and
she
threw
down
a
little
cobblestone
near
the
place
where
jesus
lifted
by
the
whips
was
moving
slowly
of
course
of
course
he
should
have
cured
my
toothache
replied
ironically
and
he
added
bitterly
with
irritation
what
dust
they
have
kicked
up
like
a
herd
of
cattle
they
should
all
be
driven
away
with
a
stick
take
me
down
sarah
the
wife
proved
to
be
right
the
spectacle
had
diverted
slightly
perhaps
it
was
the
rats
litter
that
had
helped
after
all
he
succeeded
in
falling
asleep
when
he
awoke
his
toothache
had
passed
almost
entirely
and
only
a
little
inflammation
had
formed
over
his
right
jaw
his
wife
told
him
that
it
was
not
noticeable
at
all
but
smiled
cunningly
he
knew
how
his
wife
was
and
how
fond
she
was
of
telling
him
pleasant
things
samuel
the
tanner
a
neighbour
of
s
came
in
and
led
him
to
see
the
new
little
donkey
and
listened
proudly
to
the
warm
praises
for
himself
and
his
animal
then
at
the
request
of
the
curious
sarah
the
three
went
to
golgotha
to
see
the
people
who
had
been
crucified
on
the
way
told
samuel
in
detail
how
he
had
felt
a
pain
in
his
right
jaw
on
the
day
before
and
how
he
awoke
at
night
with
a
terrible
toothache
to
illustrate
it
he
made
a
martyr
s
face
closing
his
eyes
shook
his
head
and
groaned
while
the
samuel
nodded
his
head
compassionately
and
said
oh
how
painful
it
must
have
been
was
pleased
with
samuel
s
attitude
and
he
repeated
the
story
to
him
then
went
back
to
the
past
when
his
first
tooth
was
spoiled
on
the
left
side
thus
absorbed
in
a
lively
conversation
they
reached
golgotha
the
sun
which
was
destined
to
shine
upon
the
world
on
that
terrible
day
had
already
set
beyond
the
distant
hills
and
in
the
west
a
narrow
strip
was
burning
like
a
stain
of
blood
the
crosses
stood
out
darkly
but
vaguely
against
this
background
and
at
the
foot
of
the
middle
cross
white
kneeling
figures
were
seen
indistinctly
the
crowd
had
long
dispersed
it
was
growing
chilly
and
after
a
glance
at
the
crucified
men
took
samuel
by
the
arm
and
carefully
turned
him
in
the
direction
toward
his
house
he
felt
that
he
was
particularly
eloquent
just
then
and
he
was
eager
to
finish
the
story
of
his
toothache
thus
they
walked
and
made
a
martyr
s
face
shook
his
head
and
groaned
skilfully
while
samuel
nodded
compassionately
and
uttered
exclamations
from
time
to
time
and
from
the
deep
narrow
defiles
out
of
the
distant
burning
plains
rose
the
black
night
it
seemed
as
though
it
wished
to
hide
from
the
view
of
heaven
the
great
crime
of
the
earth
the
serpent
s
story
hush
hush
hush
come
closer
to
me
look
into
my
eyes
i
always
was
a
fascinating
creature
tender
sensitive
and
grateful
i
was
wise
and
i
was
noble
and
i
am
so
flexible
in
the
writhing
of
my
graceful
body
that
it
will
afford
you
joy
to
watch
my
easy
dance
now
i
shall
coil
up
into
a
ring
flash
my
scales
dimly
wind
myself
around
tenderly
and
clasp
my
steel
body
in
my
gentle
cold
embraces
one
in
many
one
in
many
hush

into
my
eyes

do
not
like
my
writhing
and
my
straight
open
look
oh
my
head
is
heavy
therefore
i
sway
about
so
quietly
oh
my
head
is
heavy
therefore
i
look
so
straight
ahead
as
i
sway
about
come
closer
to
me
give
me
a
little
warmth
stroke
my
wise
forehead
with
your
fingers
in
its
fine
outlines

will
find
the
form
of
a
cup
into
which
flows
wisdom
the
dew
of
the
when
i
draw
the
air
by
my
writhing
a
trace
is
left
in
it
the
design
of
the
finest
of
webs
the
web
of
the
enchantment
of
noiseless
movements
the
inaudible
hiss
of
gliding
lines
i
am
silent
and
i
sway
myself
i
look
ahead
and
i
sway
myself
what
strange
burden
am
i
carrying
on
my
neck

a
fascinating
creature
and
loved
tenderly

i
loved

closer
to
me

you
see
my
white
sharp
enchanting
little
teeth
kissing
i
used
to
bite
not
painfully
no
just
a
trifle
caressing
tenderly
i
used
to
bite
a
little
until
the
first
bright
little
drops
appeared
until
a
cry
came
forth
which
sounded
like
the
laugh
produced
by
tickling
that
was
very
pleasant
think
not
it
was
unpleasant
otherwise
they
whom
i
kissed
would
not
come
back
for
more
kisses
it
is
now
that
i
can
kiss
only
once
how
sad
only
once
one
kiss
for
each
how
little
for
a
loving
heart
for
a
sensitive
soul
striving
for
a
great
union
but
it
is
only
i
the
sad
one
who
kiss
but
once
and
must
seek
love
again
he
knows
no
other
love
any
more
to
him
my
one
tender
nuptial
kiss
is
inviolable
and
eternal
i
am
speaking
to
you
frankly
and
when
my
story
is
ended
i
will
kiss
you
i
love
you
look
into
my
eyes
is
it
not
true
that
mine
is
a
magnificent
a
powerful
look
a
firm
look
and
a
straight
look
and
it
is
steadfast
like
steel
forced
against
your
heart
i
look
ahead
and
sway
myself
i
look
and
i
enchant
in
my
green
eyes
i
gather
your
fear
your
loving
fatigued
submissive
longing
come
closer
to
me
now
i
am
a
queen
and
you
dare
not
fail
to
see
my
beauty
but
there
was
a
strange
time
ah
what
a
strange
time
ah
what
a
strange
time
at
the
mere
recollection
i
am
agitated
ah
what
a
strange
time
no
one
loved
me
no
one
respected
me
i
was
persecuted
with
cruel
ferocity
trampled
in
the
mud
and
jeered
ah
what
a
strange
time
it
was
one
in
many
one
in
many
i
say
to
you
come
closer
to
me
why
did
they
not
love
me
at
that
time
i
was
also
a
fascinating
creature
but
without
malice
i
was
gentle
and
i
danced
wonderfully
but
they
tortured
me
they
burnt
me
with
fire
heavy
and
coarse
beasts
trampled
upon
me
with
the
dull
steps
of
terribly
heavy
feet
cold
tusks
of
bloody
mouths
tore
my
tender
body
and
in
my
powerless
sorrow
i
bit
the
sand
i
swallowed
the
dust
of
the
ground
i
was
dying
of
despair
crushed
i
was
dying
every
day
every
day
i
was
dying
of
despair
oh
what
a
terrible
time
that
was
the
stupid
forest
has
forgotten
everything
it
does
not
remember
that
time
but
you
have
pity
on
me
come
closer
to
me
have
pity
on
me
on
the
offended
on
the
sad
one
on
the
loving
one
on
the
one
who
dances
so
beautifully
i
love
you
how
could
i
defend
myself
i
had
only
my
white
wonderful
sharp
little
teeth
they
were
good
only
for
kisses
how
could
i
defend
myself
it
is
only
now
that
i
carry
on
my
neck
this
terrible
burden
of
a
head
and
my
look
is
commanding
and
straight
but
then
my
head
was
light
and
my
eyes
gazed
meekly
then
i
had
no
poison
yet
oh
my
head
is
so
heavy
and
it
is
hard
for
me
to
hold
it
up
oh
i
have
grown
tired
of
my
look
two
stones
are
in
my
forehead
and
these
are
my
eyes
perhaps
the
glittering
stones
are
precious
but
it
is
hard
to
carry
them
instead
of
gentle
eyes
they
oppress
my
brain
it
is
so
hard
for
my
head
i
look
ahead
and
sway
myself
i
see
you
in
a
green
mist
you
are
so
far
away
come
closer
to
me
you
see
even
in
sorrow
i
am
beautiful
and
my
look
is
languid
because
of
my
love
look
into
my
pupil
i
will
narrow
and
widen
it
and
give
it
a
peculiar
glitter
the
twinkling
of
a
star
at
night
the
playfulness
of
all
precious
stones
of
diamonds
of
green
emeralds
of
yellowish
topaz
of
rubies
look
into
my
eyes
it
is
i
the
queen
i
am
crowning
myself
and
that
which
is
glittering
burning
and
glowing
that
robs
you
of
your
reason
your
freedom
and
your
life
it
is
poison
it
is
a
drop
of
my
poison
how
has
it
happened
i
do
not
know
i
did
not
bear
to
the
living
i
lived
and
suffered
i
was
silent
i
languished
i
hid
myself
hurriedly
when
i
could
hide
myself
i
crawled
away
hastily
but
they
have
never
seen
me
weep
i
can
not
weep
and
my
easy
dance
grew
ever
faster
and
ever
more
beautiful
alone
in
the
stillness
alone
in
the
thicket
i
danced
with
sorrow
in
my
heart
they
despised
my
swift
dance
and
would
have
been
glad
to
kill
me
as
i
danced
suddenly
my
head
began
to
grow
heavy
how
strange
it
is
my
head
grew
heavy
just
as
small
and
beautiful
just
as
wise
and
beautiful
it
had
suddenly
grown
terribly
heavy
it
bent
my
neck
to
the
ground
and
caused
me
pain
now
i
am
somewhat
used
to
it
but
at
first
it
was
dreadfully
awkward
and
painful
i
thought
i
was
sick
and
suddenly
come
closer
to
me
look
into
my
eyes
hush
hush
hush
and
suddenly
my
look
became
heavy
it
became
fixed
and
strange
i
was
even
frightened
i
want
to
glance
and
turn
away
but
can
not
i
always
look
straight
ahead
i
pierce
with
my
eyes
ever
more
deeply
i
am
as
though
petrified
look
into
my
eyes
it
is
as
though
i
am
petrified
as
though
everything
i
look
upon
is
petrified
look
into
my
eyes
i
love
you
do
not
laugh
at
my
frank
story
or
i
shall
be
angry
every
hour
i
open
my
sensitive
heart
for
all
my
efforts
are
in
vain
i
am
alone
my
one
and
last
kiss
is
full
of
ringing
sorrow
and
the
one
i
love
is
not
here
and
i
seek
love
again
and
i
tell
my
tale
in
vain
my
heart
can
not
bare
itself
and
the
poison
torments
me
and
my
head
grows
heavier
am
i
not
beautiful
in
my
despair
come
closer
to
me
i
love
you
once
i
was
bathing
in
a
stagnant
swamp
in
the
forest
i
love
to
be
clean
it
is
a
sign
of
noble
birth
and
i
bathe
frequently
while
bathing
dancing
in
the
water
i
saw
my
reflection
and
as
always
fell
in
love
with
myself
i
am
so
fond
of
the
beautiful
and
the
wise
and
suddenly
i
saw
on
my
forehead
among
my
other
inborn
adornments
a
new
strange
sign
was
it
not
this
sign
that
has
brought
the
heaviness
the
petrified
look
and
the
sweet
taste
in
my
mouth
here
a
cross
is
darkly
outlined
on
my
forehead
right
here
look
come
closer
to
me
is
this
not
strange
but
i
did
not
understand
it
at
that
time
and
i
liked
it
let
there
be
no
more
adornment
and
on
the
same
day
on
that
same
terrible
day
when
the
cross
appeared
my
first
kiss
became
also
my
last
my
kiss
became
fatal
one
in
many
one
in
many
oh
you
love
precious
stones
but
think
my
beloved
how
far
more
precious
is
a
little
drop
of
my
poison
it
is
such
a
little
have
you
ever
seen
it
never
never
but
you
shall
find
it
out
consider
my
beloved
how
much
suffering
painful
humiliation
powerless
rage
devoured
me
i
had
to
experience
in
order
to
bring
forth
this
little
drop
i
am
a
queen
i
am
a
queen
in
one
drop
brought
forth
by
myself
i
carry
death
unto
the
living
and
my
kingdom
is
limitless
even
as
grief
is
limitless
even
as
death
is
limitless
i
am
queen
my
look
is
inexorable
my
dance
is
terrible
i
am
beautiful
one
in
many
one
in
many
oh
do
not
fall
my
story
is
not
yet
ended
come
closer
to
me
and
then
i
crawled
into
the
stupid
forest
into
my
green
dominion
now
it
is
a
new
way
a
terrible
way
i
was
kind
like
a
queen
and
like
a
queen
i
bowed
graciously
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
they
they
ran
away
like
a
queen
i
bowed
benevolently
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
they
queer
people
they
ran
away
what
do
you
think
why
did
they
run
away
what
do
you
think
look
into
my
eyes
do
you
see
in
them
a
certain
glimmer
and
a
flash
the
rays
of
my
crown
blind
your
eyes
you
are
petrified
you
are
lost
i
shall
soon
dance
my
last
dance
not
fall
i
shall
coil
into
rings
i
shall
flash
my
scales
dimly
and
i
shall
clasp
my
steel
body
in
my
gentle
cold
embraces
here
i
am
accept
my
only
kiss
my
nuptial
kiss
in
it
is
the
deadly
grief
of
all
oppressed
lives

in
many

in
many
bend
down
to
me
i
love
you
die
love
faith
and
hope
he
loved
according
to
his
passport
he
was
called
max
z
but
as
it
was
stated
in
the
same
passport
that
he
had
no
special
peculiarities
about
his
features
i
prefer
to
call
him
he
represented
a
long
line
of
young
men
who
possess
wavy
dishevelled
locks
straight
bold
and
open
looks
and
strong
bodies
and
very
large
and
powerful
hearts
all
these
youths
have
loved
and
perpetuated
their
love
some
of
them
have
succeeded
in
engraving
it
on
the
tablets
of
history
like
henry
iv
others
like
petrarch
have
made
literary
preserves
of
it
some
have
availed
themselves
for
that
purpose
of
the
newspapers
wherein
the
happenings
of
the
day
are
recorded
and
where
they
figured
among
those
who
had
strangled
themselves
shot
themselves
or
who
had
been
shot
by
others
still
others
the
happiest
and
most
modest
of
all
perpetuated
their
love
by
entering
it
in
the
birth
records
by
creating
posterity
the
love
of
was
as
strong
as
death
as
a
certain
writer
put
it
as
strong
as
life
he
thought
max
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
was
the
first
to
have
discovered
the
method
of
loving
so
intensely
so
unrestrainedly
so
passionately
and
he
regarded
with
contempt
all
who
had
loved
before
him
still
more
he
was
convinced
that
even
after
him
no
one
would
love
as
he
did
and
he
felt
sorry
that
with
his
death
the
secret
of
true
love
would
be
lost
to
mankind
but
being
a
modest
young
man
he
attributed
part
of
his
achievement
to
her
to
his
beloved
not
that
she
was
perfection
itself
but
she
came
very
close
to
it
as
close
as
an
ideal
can
come
to
reality
there
were
prettier
women
than
she
there
were
wiser
women
but
was
there
ever
a
better
woman
did
there
ever
exist
a
woman
on
whose
face
was
so
clearly
and
distinctly
written
that
she
alone
was
worthy
of
love
of
infinite
pure
and
devoted
love
max
knew
that
there
never
were
and
that
there
never
would
be
such
women
in
this
respect
he
had
no
special
peculiarities
just
as
adam
did
not
have
them
just
as
you
my
reader
do
not
have
them
beginning
with
grandmother
eve
and
ending
with
the
woman
upon
whom
your
eyes
were
directed
before
you
read
these
lines
the
same
inscription
is
to
be
clearly
and
distinctly
read
on
the
face
of
every
woman
at
a
certain
time
the
difference
is
only
in
the
quality
of
the
ink
a
very
nasty
day
set
in
it
was
monday
or
tuesday
when
max
noticed
with
a
feeling
of
great
terror
that
the
inscription
upon
the
dear
face
was
fading
max
rubbed
his
eyes
looked
first
from
a
distance
then
from
all
sides
but
the
fact
was
undeniable
the
inscription
was
fading
soon
the
last
letter
also
disappeared
the
face
was
white
like
the
recently
whitewashed
wall
of
a
new
house
but
he
was
convinced
that
the
inscription
had
disappeared
not
of
itself
but
that
some
one
had
wiped
it
off
who
max
went
to
his
friend
john
he
knew
and
he
felt
sure
that
such
a
true
disinterested
and
honest
friend
there
never
was
and
never
would
be
and
in
this
respect
too
as
you
see
max
had
no
special
peculiarities
he
went
to
his
friend
for
the
purpose
of
taking
his
advice
concerning
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
inscription
and
found
john
exactly
at
the
moment
when
he
was
wiping
away
that
inscription
by
his
kisses
it
was
then
that
the
records
of
the
local
occurrences
were
enriched
by
another
unfortunate
incident
entitled
an
attempt
at
it
is
said
that
death
always
comes
in
due
time
evidently
that
time
had
not
yet
arrived
for
max
for
he
remained
alive
that
is
he
ate
drank
walked
borrowed
money
and
did
not
return
it
and
altogether
he
showed
by
a
series
of
acts
that
he
was
a
living
being
possessing
a
stomach
a
will
and
a
mind
but
his
soul
was
dead
or
to
be
more
exact
it
was
absorbed
in
lethargic
sleep
the
sound
of
human
speech
reached
his
ears
his
eyes
saw
tears
and
laughter
but
all
that
did
not
stir
a
single
echo
a
single
emotion
in
his
soul
i
do
not
know
what
space
of
time
had
elapsed
it
may
have
been
one
year
and
it
may
have
been
ten
years
for
the
length
of
such
intermissions
in
life
depends
on
how
quickly
the
actor
succeeds
in
changing
his
costume
one
beautiful
day
it
was
wednesday
or
thursday
max
awakened
completely
a
careful
and
guarded
liquidation
of
his
spiritual
property
made
it
clear
that
a
fair
piece
of
max
s
soul
the
part
which
contained
his
love
for
woman
and
for
his
friends
was
dead
like
a
hand
or
foot
but
what
remained
was
nevertheless
enough
for
life
that
was
love
for
and
faith
in
mankind
then
max
having
renounced
personal
happiness
started
to
work
for
the
happiness
of
others
that
was
a
new
phase
he
believed
all
the
evil
that
is
tormenting
the
world
seemed
to
him
to
be
concentrated
in
a
red
flower
in
one
red
flower
it
was
but
necessary
to
tear
it
down
and
the
incessant
cries
and
moans
which
rise
to
the
indifferent
sky
from
all
points
of
the
earth
like
its
natural
breathing
would
be
silenced
the
evil
of
the
world
he
believed
lay
in
the
evil
will
and
in
the
madness
of
the
people
they
themselves
were
to
blame
for
being
unhappy
and
they
could
be
happy
if
they
wished
this
seemed
so
clear
and
simple
that
max
was
dumfounded
in
his
amazement
at
human
stupidity
humanity
reminded
him
of
a
crowd
huddled
together
in
a
spacious
temple
and
at
the
cry
of
fire
instead
of
passing
calmly
through
the
wide
doors
and
saving
themselves
the
maddened
people
with
the
cruelty
of
frenzied
beasts
cry
and
roar
crush
one
another
and
perish
not
from
the
fire
for
it
is
only
imaginary
but
from
their
own
madness
it
is
enough
sometimes
when
one
sensible
firm
word
is
uttered
to
this
crowd
the
crowd
calms
down
and
imminent
death
is
thus
averted
let
then
a
hundred
calm
rational
voices
be
raised
to
mankind
showing
them
where
to
escape
and
where
the
danger
lies
and
heaven
will
be
established
on
earth
if
not
immediately
then
at
least
within
a
very
brief
time
max
began
to
utter
his
word
of
wisdom
how
he
uttered
it
you
will
learn
later
the
name
of
max
was
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
shouted
in
the
market
places
blessed
and
cursed
whole
books
were
written
on
what
max
had
done
what
he
was
doing
and
what
he
intended
to
do
he
appeared
here
and
there
and
everywhere
he
was
seen
standing
at
the
head
of
the
crowd
commanding
it
he
was
seen
in
chains
and
under
the
knife
of
the
guillotine
in
this
respect
max
did
not
have
any
special
peculiarities
either
a
preacher
of
humility
and
peace
a
stern
bearer
of
fire
and
sword
he
was
the
same
max
max
the
believer
but
while
he
was
doing
all
this
time
kept
passing
on
his
nerves
were
shattered
his
wavy
locks
became
thin
and
his
head
began
to
look
like
that
of
elijah
the
prophet
here
and
there
he
felt
a
piercing
pain
the
earth
continued
to
turn
around
the
sun
now
coming
nearer
to
it
now
retreating
coquettishly
and
giving
the
impression
that
it
fixed
all
its
attention
upon
its
household
friend
the
moon
the
days
were
replaced
by
other
days
and
the
dark
nights
by
other
dark
nights
with
such
pedantic
german
punctuality
and
correctness
that
all
the
artistic
natures
were
compelled
to
move
over
to
the
far
north
by
degrees
where
the
devil
himself
would
break
his
head
endeavouring
to
distinguish
between
day
and
night
when
suddenly
something
happened
to
max
somehow
it
happened
that
max
became
misunderstood
he
had
calmed
the
crowd
by
his
words
of
wisdom
many
a
time
before
and
had
saved
them
from
mutual
destruction
but
now
he
was
not
understood
they
thought
that
it
was
he
who
had
shouted
fire
with
all
the
eloquence
of
which
he
was
capable
he
assured
them
that
he
was
exerting
all
his
efforts
for
their
sake
alone
that
he
himself
needed
absolutely
nothing
for
he
was
alone
childless
that
he
was
ready
to
forget
the
sad
misunderstanding
and
serve
them
again
with
faith
and
truth
but
all
in
vain
they
would
not
trust
him
and
in
this
respect
max
did
not
have
any
special
peculiarities
either
the
sad
incident
ended
for
max
in
a
new
intermission
max
was
alive
as
was
positively
established
by
medical
experts
who
had
made
a
series
of
simple
tests
thus
when
they
pricked
a
needle
into
his
foot
he
shook
his
foot
and
tried
to
remove
the
needle
when
they
put
food
before
him
he
ate
it
but
he
did
not
walk
and
did
not
ask
for
any
loans
which
clearly
testified
to
the
complete
decline
of
his
energy
his
soul
was
dead
as
much
as
the
soul
can
be
dead
while
the
body
is
alive
to
max
all
that
he
had
loved
and
believed
in
was
dead
impenetrable
gloom
wrapped
his
soul
there
were
neither
feelings
in
it
nor
desires
nor
thoughts
and
there
was
not
a
more
unhappy
man
in
the
world
than
max
if
he
was
a
man
at
all
but
he
was
a
man
according
to
the
calendar
it
was
friday
or
saturday
when
max
awakened
as
from
a
prolonged
sleep
with
the
pleasant
sensation
of
an
owner
to
whom
his
property
has
been
restored
which
had
wrongly
been
taken
from
him
max
realised
that
he
was
once
more
in
possession
of
all
his
five
senses
his
sight
reported
to
him
that
he
was
all
alone
in
a
place
which
might
in
justice
be
called
either
a
room
or
a
chimney
each
wall
of
the
room
was
about
a
metre
and
a
half
wide
and
about
ten
metres
high
the
walls
were
straight
white
smooth
with
no
openings
except
one
through
which
food
was
brought
to
max
an
electric
lamp
was
burning
brightly
on
the
ceiling
it
was
burning
all
the
time
so
that
max
did
not
know
now
what
darkness
was
there
was
no
furniture
in
the
room
and
max
had
to
lie
on
the
stone
floor
he
lay
curled
together
as
the
narrowness
of
the
room
did
not
permit
him
to
stretch
himself
his
sense
of
hearing
reported
to
him
that
until
the
day
of
his
death
he
would
not
leave
this
room
having
reported
this
his
hearing
sank
into
inactivity
for
not
the
slightest
sound
came
from
without
except
the
sounds
which
max
himself
produced
tossing
about
or
shouting
until
he
was
hoarse
until
he
lost
his
voice
max
looked
into
himself
in
contrast
to
the
outward
light
which
never
went
out
he
saw
within
himself
impenetrable
heavy
and
motionless
darkness
in
that
darkness
his
love
and
faith
were
buried
max
did
not
know
whether
time
was
moving
or
whether
it
stood
motionless
the
same
even
white
light
poured
down
on
him
the
same
silence
and
quiet
only
by
the
beating
of
his
heart
max
could
judge
that
chronos
had
not
left
his
chariot
his
body
was
aching
ever
more
from
the
unnatural
position
in
which
it
lay
and
the
constant
light
and
silence
were
growing
ever
more
tormenting
how
happy
are
they
for
whom
night
exists
near
whom
people
are
shouting
making
noise
beating
drums
who
may
sit
on
a
chair
with
their
feet
hanging
down
or
lie
with
their
feet
outstretched
placing
the
head
in
a
corner
and
covering
it
with
the
hands
in
order
to
create
the
illusion
of
darkness
max
made
an
effort
to
recall
and
to
picture
to
himself
what
there
is
in
life
human
faces
voices
the
stars
he
knew
that
his
eyes
would
never
in
life
see
that
again
he
knew
it
and
yet
he
lived
he
could
have
destroyed
himself
for
there
is
no
position
in
which
a
man
can
not
do
that
but
instead
max
worried
about
his
health
trying
to
eat
although
he
had
no
appetite
solving
mathematical
problems
to
occupy
his
mind
so
as
not
to
lose
his
reason
he
struggled
against
death
as
if
it
were
not
his
deliverer
but
his
enemy
and
as
if
life
were
to
him
not
the
worst
of
infernal
tortures
but
love
faith
and
happiness
gloom
in
the
past
the
grave
in
the
future
and
infernal
tortures
in
the
present
and
yet
he
lived
tell
me
john
where
did
he
get
the
strength
for
that
he
hoped

the

heavy

in
its

side
by
side
as
if
attached
to
one
another
the
roofs
and
the
walls
embracing
one
another
pressing
close
to
one
another
seized
with
the
same
uneasiness
before
the
eternal
unknown
right
here
there
is
also
a
little
church
its
side
wall
formed
crudely
of
rough
granite
with
a
deep
window
which
seems
to
be
concealing
itself
a
cautious
sound
of
women
s
voices
is
heard
softened
by
uneasiness
and
by
the
approaching
night
we
can
sleep
peacefully
the
sea
is
calm
and
the
rollers
are
breaking
like
the
clock
in
the
steeple
of
old
they
will
come
back
with
the
morning
tide
my
husband
told
me
that
they
will
come
back
with
the
morning
perhaps
they
will
come
back
with
the
evening
tide
it
is
better
for
us
to
think
they
will
come
back
in
the
evening
so
that
our
waiting
will
not
be
in
vain
but
i
must
build
a
fire
in
the
when
the
men
are
away
from
home
one
does
not
feel
like
starting
a
fire
i
never
build
a
fire
even
when
i
am
awake
it
seems
to
me
that
fire
brings
a
storm
it
is
better
to
be
quiet
and
and
listen
to
the
wind
no
that
is
i
love
the
fire
i
should
like
to
sleep
near
the
fire
but
my
husband
does
not
allow
why
doesn
t
old
dan
come
here
it
is
time
to
strike
the
old
dan
will
play
in
the
church
he
can
not
bear
such
silence
as
this
when
the
sea
is
roaring
old
dan
hides
himself
and
is
silent
he
is
afraid
of
the
sea
but
as
soon
as
the
waves
calm
down
dan
crawls
out
quietly
and
sits
down
to
play
his
the
women
laugh
softly
he
reproaches
the
he
is
complaining
to
god
against
it
he
knows
how
to
complain
well
one
feels
like
crying
when
he
tells
god
about
those
who
have
perished
at
sea
mariet
have
you
seen
dan
why
are
you
silent
mariet
mariet
is
the
adopted
daughter
of
the
abbot
in
whose
house
old
dan
the
organist
lives
absorbed
in
thought
she
does
not
hear
the
question
mariet
do
you
hear
anna
is
asking
you
whether
you
have
seen
dan
yes
i
think
i
have
i
don
t
remember
he
is
in
his
room
he
does
not
like
to
leave
his
room
when
father
goes
dan
is
fond
of
the
city
priests
he
can
not
get
used
to
the
idea
of
a
priest
who
goes
fishing
like
an
ordinary
fisherman
and
who
goes
to
sea
with
our
he
is
simply
afraid
of
the
you
may
say
what
you
like
but
i
believe
we
have
the
very
best
priest
in
the
that
s
true
i
fear
him
but
i
love
him
as
a
may
god
forgive
me
but
i
would
have
been
proud
and
always
happy
if
i
were
his
adopted
daughter
do
you
hear
mariet
the
women
laugh
softly
and
tenderly
do
you
hear
mariet
i
do
but
aren
t
you
tired
of
always
laughing
at
the
same
thing
yes
i
am
his
daughter
is
it
so
funny
that
you
will
laugh
all
your
life
at
it
the
women
commence
to
justify
themselves
confusedly
but
he
laughs
at
it
the
abbot
is
fond
of
jesting
he
says
so
comically
my
adopted
daughter
and
then
he
strikes
himself
with
his
fist
and
shouts
she
s
my
real
daughter
not
my
adopted
daughter
she
s
my
real
i
have
never
known
my
mother
but
this
laughter
would
have
been
unpleasant
to
her
i
feel
it
says
mariet
the
women
grow
silent
the
breakers
strike
against
the
shore
dully
with
the
regularity
of
a
great
pendulum
the
unknown
city
wrapped
with
fire
and
smoke
is
still
being
destroyed
in
the
sky
yet
it
does
not
fall
down
completely
and
the
sea
is
waiting
mariet
lifts
her
lowered
head
what
were
you
going
to
say
mariet
didn
t
he
pass
here
asks
mariet
in
a
low
voice
another
woman
answers
timidly
hush
why
do
you
speak
of
him
i
fear
him
no
he
did
not
pass
this
he
did
i
saw
from
the
window
that
he
passed
you
are
mistaken
it
was
some
one
who
else
could
that
be
is
it
possible
to
make
a
mistake
if
you
have
once
seen
him
walk
no
one
walks
as
he
naval
officers
englishmen
walk
like
no
haven
t
i
seen
naval
officers
in
the
city
they
walk
firmly
but
openly
even
a
girl
could
trust
oh
look
out
frightened
and
cautious
laughter
no
don
t
laugh
he
walks
without
looking
at
the
ground
he
puts
his
feet
down
as
if
the
ground
itself
must
take
them
cautiously
and
place
but
if
there
s
a
stone
on
the
road
we
have
many
stones
he
does
not
bend
down
nor
does
he
hide
his
head
when
a
strong
wind
of
course
not
of
course
not
he
does
not
hide
his
is
it
true
that
he
is
handsome
who
has
seen
him
at
close
range
i
says
mariet
no
no
don
t
speak
of
him
i
shall
not
be
able
to
sleep
all
night
since
they
settled
on
that
hill
in
that
accursed
castle
i
know
no
rest
i
am
dying
of
fear
you
are
also
afraid
confess
well
not
all
of
us
are
what
have
they
come
here
for
there
are
two
of
them
what
is
there
for
them
to
do
here
in
our
poor
land
where
we
have
nothing
but
stones
and
the
sea
they
drink
gin
the
sailor
comes
every
morning
for
they
are
simply
drunkards
who
don
t
want
anybody
to
disturb
their
drinking
when
the
sailor
passes
along
the
street
he
leaves
behind
him
an
odour
as
of
an
open
bottle
of
but
is
that
their
business
drinking
gin
i
fear
them
where
is
the
ship
that
brought
them
here
they
came
from
the
i
saw
the
ship
says
mariet
the
women
begin
to
question
her
in
amazement
you
why
then
didn
t
you
say
anything
about
it
tell
us
what
you
mariet
maintains
silence
suddenly
one
of
the
women
exclaims
ah
look
they
have
lit
a
lamp
there
is
a
light
in
the
castle
on
the
left
about
half
a
mile
away
from
the
village
a
faint
light
flares
up
a
red
little
coal
in
the
dark
blue
of
the
twilight
and
the
distance
there
upon
a
high
rock
overhanging
the
sea
stands
an
ancient
castle
a
grim
heritage
of
grey
and
mysterious
antiquity
long
destroyed
long
ruined
it
blends
with
the
rocks
continuing
and
delusively
ending
them
by
the
broken
dented
line
of
its
batteries
its
shattered
roofs
its
towers
now
the
rocks
and
the
castle
are
covered
with
a
smoky
shroud
of
twilight
they
seem
airy
devoid
of
any
weight
and
almost
as
fantastic
as
those
monstrous
heaps
of
structures
which
are
piled
up
and
which
are
falling
so
noiselessly
in
the
sky
but
while
the
others
are
falling
this
one
stands
and
a
live
light
reddens
against
the
deep
blue
and
it
is
just
as
strange
a
sight
as
if
a
human
hand
were
to
kindle
a
light
in
the
clouds
turning
their
heads
in
that
direction
the
women
look
on
with
frightened
eyes
do
you
see
says
one
of
them
it
is
even
worse
than
a
light
on
a
cemetery
who
needs
a
light
among
the
tombstones
it
is
getting
cold
toward
night
and
the
sailor
must
have
thrown
some
branches
into
the
fireplace
that
s
all
at
least
i
think
so
says
mariet
and
i
think
that
the
abbot
should
have
gone
there
with
holy
water
long
or
with
the
gendarmes
if
that
isn
t
the
devil
himself
it
is
surely
one
of
his
it
is
impossible
to
live
peacefully
with
such
neighbours
close
i
am
afraid
for
the
and
for
your
soul
two
elderly
women
rise
silently
and
go
away
then
a
third
an
old
woman
also
rises
we
must
ask
the
abbot
whether
it
isn
t
a
sin
to
look
at
such
a
she
goes
off
the
smoke
in
the
sky
is
ever
increasing
and
the
fire
is
subsiding
and
the
unknown
city
is
already
near
its
dark
end
the
sea
odour
is
growing
ever
sharper
and
stronger
night
is
coming
from
the
shore
their
heads
turned
the
women
watch
the
departing
old
woman
then
they
turn
again
toward
the
light
mariet
as
though
defending
some
one
says
softly
there
can
t
be
anything
bad
in
light
for
there
is
light
in
the
candles
on
god
s
but
there
is
also
fire
for
satan
in
hell
says
another
old
woman
heavily
and
angrily
and
then
goes
off
now
four
remain
all
young
girls
i
am
afraid
says
one
pressing
close
to
her
companion
the
noiseless
and
cold
conflagration
in
the
sky
is
ended
the
city
is
destroyed
the
unknown
land
is
in
ruins
there
are
no
longer
any
walls
or
falling
towers
a
heap
of
pale
blue
gigantic
shapes
have
fallen
silently
into
the
abyss
of
the
ocean
and
the
night
a
young
little
star
glances
at
the
earth
with
frightened
eyes
it
feels
like
coming
out
of
the
clouds
near
the
castle
and
because
of
its
inmost
neighbourship
the
heavy
castle
grows
darker
and
the
light
in
its
window
seems
redder
and
darker
good
night
mariet
says
the
girl
who
sat
alone
and
then
she
goes
off
let
us
also
go
it
is
getting
cold
say
the
other
two
rising
good
night
good
why
are
you
alone
mariet
why
are
you
alone
mariet
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
on
week
days
and
on
merry
holidays
do
you
love
to
think
of
your
betrothed
yes
i
do
i
love
to
think
of
the
girl
laughs
but
you
don
t
want
to
see
him
when
he
goes
out
to
sea
you
look
at
the
sea
for
hours
when
he
comes
back
you
are
not
there
where
are
you
hiding
yourself
i
love
to
think
of
like
a
blind
man
he
gropes
among
the
houses
forever
calling
mariet
mariet
have
you
not
seen
mariet
they
go
off
laughing
and
repeating
good
night
mariet
have
you
not
seen
mariet
mariet
the
girl
is
left
alone
she
looks
at
the
light
in
the
castle
she
hears
soft
irresolute
footsteps
old
dan
of
small
stature
slim
a
coughing
old
man
with
a
face
comes
out
from
behind
the
church
because
of
his
irresoluteness
or
because
of
the
weakness
of
his
eyes
he
steps
uncertainly
touching
the
ground
cautiously
and
with
a
certain
degree
of
fear
oho
oho
is
that
you
dan
the
sea
is
calm
dan
are
you
going
to
play
oho
i
shall
ring
the
bell
seven
times
seven
times
i
shall
ring
it
and
send
to
god
seven
of
his
holy
he
takes
the
rope
of
the
bell
and
strikes
the
hour
seven
ringing
and
slow
strokes
the
wind
plays
with
them
it
drops
them
to
the
ground
but
before
they
touch
it
it
catches
them
tenderly
sways
them
softly
and
with
a
light
accompaniment
of
whistling
carries
them
off
to
the
dark
coast
oh
no
mutters
dan
bad
hours
they
fall
to
the
ground
they
are
not
his
holy
hours
and
he
will
send
them
back
oh
a
storm
is
coming
o
lord
have
mercy
on
those
who
are
perishing
at
sea
he
mutters
and
coughs
dan
i
have
seen
the
ship
again
do
you
hear
dan
many
ships
are
going
out
to
but
this
one
had
black
sails
it
was
again
going
toward
the
many
ships
are
going
out
to
sea
listen
mariet
there
was
once
a
wise
king
oh
how
wise
he
was
and
he
commanded
that
the
sea
be
lashed
with
chains
oho
i
know
dan
you
told
me
about
oho
with
chains
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
christen
the
sea
why
did
it
not
occur
to
him
to
do
that
mariet
ah
why
did
he
not
think
of
it
we
have
no
such
kings
what
would
have
happened
dan
oho
he
whispers
softly
all
the
rivers
and
the
streams
have
already
been
christened
and
the
cross
of
the
lord
has
touched
even
many
stagnant
swamps
only
the
sea
remained
that
nasty
salty
deep
why
do
you
scold
it
it
does
not
like
to
be
scolded
mariet
reproaches
him
oho
let
the
sea
not
like
it
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
the
sea
thinks
it
is
also
an
organ
and
music
for
god
it
is
a
nasty
hissing
furious
pool
a
salty
spit
of
satan
fie
fie
fie
he
goes
to
the
doors
at
the
entrance
of
the
church
muttering
angrily
threatening
as
though
celebrating
some
victory
oho
oho
dan
go
dan
why
don
t
you
light
candles
when
you
play
dan
i
don
t
love
my
betrothed
do
you
hear
dan
dan
turns
his
head
unwillingly
i
have
heard
it
long
ago
mariet
tell
it
to
your
where
is
my
mother
dan
oho
you
are
mad
again
mariet
you
are
gazing
too
much
at
the
sea
yes
i
am
going
to
tell
i
am
going
to
tell
your
father
he
enters
the
church
soon
the
sounds
of
the
organ
are
heard
faint
in
the
first
deeply
pensive
chords
they
rapidly
gain
strength
and
with
a
passionate
sadness
their
human
melodies
now
wrestle
with
the
dull
and
gloomy
plaintiveness
of
the
tireless
surf
like
seagulls
in
a
storm
the
sounds
soar
amidst
the
high
waves
unable
to
rise
higher
on
their
overburdened
wings
the
stern
ocean
holds
them
captive
by
its
wild
and
eternal
charms
but
when
they
have
risen
the
lowered
ocean
roars
more
dully
now
they
rise
still
higher
and
the
heavy
almost
voiceless
pile
of
water
is
shaking
helplessly
varied
voices
resound
through
the
expanse
of
the
resplendent
distances
day
has
one
sorrow
night
has
another
sorrow
and
the
proud
ever
rebellious
black
ocean
suddenly
seems
to
become
an
eternal
slave
her
cheek
pressed
against
the
cold
stone
of
the
wall
mariet
is
listening
all
alone
she
is
growing
reconciled
to
something
she
is
grieving
ever
more
quietly
suddenly
firm
footsteps
are
heard
on
the
road
the
cobblestones
are
creaking
under
the
vigorous
steps
and
a
man
appears
from
behind
the
church
he
walks
slowly
and
sternly
like
those
who
do
not
roam
in
vain
and
who
know
the
earth
from
end
to
end
he
carries
his
hat
in
his
hands
he
is
thinking
of
something
looking
ahead
on
his
broad
shoulders
is
set
a
round
strong
head
with
short
hair
his
dark
profile
is
stern
and
commandingly
haughty
and
although
the
man
is
dressed
in
a
partly
military
uniform
he
does
not
subject
his
body
to
the
discipline
of
his
clothes
but
masters
it
as
a
free
man
the
folds
of
his
clothes
fall
submissively
mariet
greets
him
good
he
walks
on
quite
a
distance
then
stops
and
turns
his
head
slowly
he
waits
silently
as
though
regretting
to
part
with
his
silence
did
you
say
good
evening
to
me
he
asks
at
last
yes
to
you
good
he
looks
at
her
silently
well
good
evening
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
greeted
in
this
land
and
i
was
surprised
when
i
heard
your
voice
come
nearer
to
me
why
don
t
you
sleep
when
all
are
sleeping
who
are
you
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
abbot
of
this
he
laughs

priests

or
are
there
special
priests
in
your
land
yes
the
priests
are
different

me
something
about
the
priest
of
this
who
is
khorre
my
sailor
the
one
who
buys
gin
in
your
he
suddenly
laughs
again
and
continues
yes
he
told
me
something
was
it
your
father
who
cursed
the
pope
and
declared
his
own
church
independent
and
he
makes
his
own
prayers
and
goes
to
sea
with
the
fishermen
and
punishes
with
his
own
hands
those
who
disobey
him
yes
i
am
his
daughter
my
name
is
mariet
and
what
is
your
name
i
have
many
names
which
one
shall
i
tell
you

one
by
which
you
were
what
makes
you
think
that
i
was
christened
then

me

name

which
your
mother
called
what
makes
you
think
that
i
had
a
mother
i
do
not
know
my
mariet
says
softly
neither
do
i
know
my
both
are
silent
they
look
at
each
other
kindly
is
that
so
he
says
you
too
don
t
know
your
mother
well
then
call
me
haggart
yes
do
you
like
the
name
i
have
invented
it
myself
haggart
it
s
a
pity
that
you
have
been
named
already
i
would
have
invented
a
fine
name
for
suddenly
he
frowned
tell
me
mariet
why
is
your
land
so
mournful
i
walk
along
your
paths
and
only
the
cobblestones
creak
under
my
feet
and
on
both
sides
are
huge
that
is
on
the
road
to
the
castle
none
of
us
ever
go
there
is
it
true
that
these
stones
stop
the
passersby
with
the
question
where
are
you
going
no
they
are
mute
why
is
your
land
so
mournful
it
is
almost
a
week
since
i
ve
seen
my
shadow
it
is
impossible
i
don
t
see
my
our
land
is
very
cheerful
and
full
of
joy
it
is
still
winter
now
but
soon
spring
will
come
and
sunshine
will
come
back
with
it
you
shall
see
it
he
speaks
with
contempt
and
you
are
sitting
and
waiting
calmly
for
its
return
you
must
be
a
fine
set
of
people
ah
if
i
only
had
a
ship
what
would
you
have
done
he
looks
at
her
morosely
and
shakes
his
head
suspiciously
you
are
too
inquisitive
little
girl
has
any
one
sent
you
over
to
me
no
what
do
you
need
a
ship
for
haggart
laughs
and
ironically
she
asks
what
a
man
needs
a
ship
for
you
must
be
a
fine
set
of
people
you
don
t
know
what
a
man
needs
a
ship
for
and
you
speak
seriously
if
i
had
a
ship
i
would
have
rushed
toward
the
sun
and
it
would
not
matter
how
it
sets
its
golden
sails
i
would
overtake
it
with
my
black
sails
and
i
would
force
it
to
outline
my
shadow
on
the
deck
of
my
ship
and
i
would
put
my
foot
upon
it
this
way
he
stamps
his
foot
firmly
then
mariet
asks
cautiously
did
you
say
with
black
sails
that
s
what
i
said
why
do
you
always
ask
questions
i
have
no
ship
you
know
he
puts
on
his
hat
but
does
not
move
mariet
maintains
silence
then
he
says
very
angrily
perhaps
you
too
like
the
music
of
your
old
dan
that
old
fool
you
know
his
name
khorre
told
me
it
i
don
t
like
his
music
no
no
bring
me
a
good
honest
dog
or
beast
and
he
will
howl
you
will
say
that
he
knows
no
music
he
does
but
he
can
t
bear
falsehood
here
is
music
listen
he
takes
mariet
by
the
hand
and
turns
her
roughly
her
face
toward
the
ocean
do
you
hear
this
is
music
your
dan
has
robbed
the
sea
and
the
wind
no
he
is
worse
than
a
thief
he
is
a
deceiver
he
should
be
hanged
on
a
sailyard
your
dan
he
goes
but
after
taking
two
steps
he
turns
around
i
said
to
you
go
home
let
this
fool
play
alone
well
mariet
is
silent
motionless
haggart
laughs
are
you
afraid
perhaps
that
i
have
forgotten
your
name
i
remember
it
your
name
is
mariet
go
she
says
softly
i
have
seen
your
haggart
advances
to
her
quickly
and
bends
down
his
face
is
terrible
it
is
not
true
when
last
it
is
not
true
which
way
was
it
going
toward
the
last
evening
i
was
drunk
and
i
slept
but
this
is
not
true
i
have
never
seen
it
you
are
testing
me
beware
shall
i
tell
you
if
i
see
it
again
how
can
you
tell
me
i
shall
come
up
your
haggart
looks
at
her
attentively
if
you
are
only
telling
me
the
truth
what
sort
of
people
are
there
in
your
land
false
or
not
in
the
lands
i
know
all
the
people
are
false
has
any
one
else
seen
that
ship
i
don
t
know
i
was
alone
on
the
shore
now
i
see
that
it
was
not
your
ship
you
are
not
glad
to
hear
of
haggart
is
silent
as
though
he
has
forgotten
her
presence
you
have
a
pretty
uniform
you
are
silent
i
shall
come
up
to
haggart
is
silent
his
dark
profile
is
stern
and
wildly
gloomy
every
motion
of
his
powerful
body
every
fold
of
his
clothes
is
full
of
the
dull
silence
of
the
taciturnity
of
long
hours
or
days
or
perhaps
of
a
lifetime
your
sailor
will
not
kill
me
you
are
silent
i
have
a
betrothed
his
name
is
philipp
but
i
don
t
love
him
you
are
now
like
that
rock
which
lies
on
the
road
leading
to
the
haggart
turns
around
silently
and
starts
i
also
remember
your
name
your
name
is
he
goes
away
haggart
calls
mariet
but
he
has
already
disappeared
behind
the
house
only
the
creaking
of
the
scattered
cobblestones
is
heard
dying
away
in
the
misty
air
dan
who
has
taken
a
rest
is
playing
again
he
is
telling
god
about
those
who
have
perished
at
sea
the
night
is
growing
darker
neither
the
rock
nor
the
castle
is
visible
now
only
the
light
in
the
window
is
redder
and
brighter
the
dull
thuds
of
the
tireless
breakers
are
telling
the
story
of
different
lives
chapter
ii
a
strong
wind
is
tossing
the
fragment
of
a
sail
which
is
hanging
over
the
large
open
window
the
sail
is
too
small
to
cover
the
entire
window
and
through
the
gaping
hole
the
dark
night
is
breathing
inclement
weather
there
is
no
rain
but
the
warm
wind
saturated
with
the
sea
is
heavy
and
damp
here
in
the
tower
live
haggart
and
his
sailor
khorre
both
are
sleeping
now
a
heavy
drunken
sleep
on
the
table
and
in
the
corners
of
the
room
there
are
empty
bottles
and
the
remains
of
food
the
only
taburet
is
overturned
lying
on
one
side
toward
evening
the
sailor
got
up
lit
a
large
illumination
lamp
and
was
about
to
do
more
but
he
was
overcome
by
intoxication
again
and
fell
asleep
upon
his
thin
mattress
of
straw
and
seagrass
tossed
by
the
wind
the
flame
of
the
is
quivering
in
yellow
restless
spots
over
the
uneven
mutilated
walls
losing
itself
in
the
dark
opening
of
the
door
which
leads
to
the
other
rooms
of
the
castle
haggart
lies
on
his
back
and
the
same
quivering
yellow
shades
run
noiselessly
over
his
strong
forehead
approach
his
closed
eyes
his
straight
sharply
outlined
nose
and
tossing
about
in
confusion
rush
back
to
the
wall
the
breathing
of
the
sleeping
man
is
deep
and
uneven
from
time
to
time
his
heavy
strange
hand
lifts
itself
makes
several
weak
unfinished
movements
and
falls
down
on
his
breast
helplessly
outside
the
window
the
breakers
are
roaring
and
raging
beating
against
the
rocks
this
is
the
second
day
a
storm
is
raging
in
the
ocean
the
ancient
tower
is
quivering
from
the
violent
blows
of
the
waves
it
responds
to
the
storm
with
the
rustling
of
the
falling
plaster
with
the
rattling
of
the
little
cobblestones
as
they
are
torn
down
with
the
whisper
and
moans
of
the
wind
which
has
lost
its
way
in
the
passages
it
whispers
and
mutters
like
an
old
woman
the
sailor
begins
to
feel
cold
on
the
stone
floor
on
which
the
wind
spreads
itself
like
water
he
tosses
about
folds
his
legs
under
himself
draws
his
head
into
his
shoulders
gropes
for
his
imaginary
clothes
but
is
unable
to
wake
up
his
intoxication
produced
by
a
two
days
spree
is
heavy
and
severe
but
now
the
wind
whines
more
powerfully
than
before
something
heaves
a
deep
groan
perhaps
a
part
of
a
destroyed
wall
has
sunk
into
the
sea
the
quivering
yellow
spots
commence
to
toss
about
upon
the
crooked
wall
more
desperately
and
khorre
awakes
he
sits
up
on
his
mattress
looks
around
but
is
unable
to
understand
anything
the
wind
is
hissing
like
a
robber
summoning
other
robbers
and
filling
the
night
with
disquieting
phantoms
it
seems
as
if
the
sea
were
full
of
sinking
vessels
of
people
who
are
drowning
and
desperately
struggling
with
death
voices
are
heard
somewhere
near
by
people
are
shouting
scolding
each
other
laughing
and
singing
like
madmen
or
talking
sensibly
and
rapidly
it
seems
that
soon
one
will
see
a
strange
human
face
distorted
by
horror
or
laughter
or
fingers
bent
convulsively
but
there
is
a
strong
smell
of
the
sea
and
that
together
with
the
cold
brings
khorre
to
his
senses
noni
he
calls
hoarsely
but
haggart
does
not
hear
him
after
a
moment
s
thought
he
calls
once
more
captain
noni
get
but
haggart
does
not
answer
and
the
sailor
mutters
noni
is
drunk
and
he
sleeps
let
him
sleep
oh
what
a
cold
night
it
is
there
isn
t
enough
warmth
in
it
even
to
warm
your
nose
i
am
cold
i
feel
cold
and
lonesome
noni
i
can
t
drink
like
that
although
everybody
knows
i
am
a
drunkard
but
it
is
one
thing
to
drink
and
another
to
drown
in
gin
that
s
an
entirely
different
matter
noni
you
are
like
a
drowned
man
simply
like
a
corpse
i
feel
ashamed
for
your
sake
noni
i
shall
drink
now
and
he
rises
and
staggering
finds
an
unopened
bottle
and
drinks
a
fine
wind
they
call
this
a
storm
do
you
hear
noni
they
call
this
a
storm
what
will
they
call
a
real
storm
he
drinks
again
a
fine
wind
he
goes
over
to
the
window
and
pushing
aside
the
corner
of
the
sail
looks
out
not
a
single
light
on
the
sea
or
in
the
village
they
have
hidden
themselves
and
are
sleeping
they
are
waiting
for
the
storm
to
pass
how
cold
i
would
have
driven
them
all
out
to
sea
it
is
mean
to
go
to
sea
only
when
the
weather
is
calm
that
is
cheating
the
sea
i
am
a
pirate
that
s
true
my
name
is
khorre
and
i
should
have
been
hanged
long
ago
on
a
yard
that
s
true
too
but
i
shall
never
allow
myself
such
meanness
as
to
cheat
the
sea
why
did
you
bring
me
to
this
hole
noni
he
picks
up
some
brushwood
and
throws
it
into
the
fireplace
i
love
you
noni
i
am
now
going
to
start
a
fire
to
warm
your
feet
i
used
to
be
your
nurse
noni
but
you
have
lost
your
reason
that
s
true
i
am
a
wise
man
but
i
don
t
understand
your
conduct
at
all
why
did
you
drop
your
ship
you
will
be
hanged
noni
you
will
be
hanged
and
i
will
dangle
by
your
side
you
have
lost
your
reason
that
s
true
he
starts
a
fire
then
prepares
food
and
drink
what
will
you
say
when
you
wake
up
and
i
will
answer
here
it
then
you
will
say
something
to
and
i
will
answer
here
it
and
then
you
will
drink
your
fill
again
and
i
will
drink
with
you
and
you
will
prate
nonsense
how
long
is
this
going
to
last
we
have
lived
this
way
two
months
now
or
perhaps
two
years
or
twenty
years
i
am
drowning
in
gin
i
don
t
understand
your
conduct
at
all
he
drinks
either
i
have
lost
my
mind
from
this
gin
or
a
ship
is
being
wrecked
near
by
how
they
are
crying
he
looks
out
of
the
window
no
no
one
is
here
it
is
the
wind
the
wind
feels
weary
and
it
plays
all
by
itself
it
has
seen
many
shipwrecks
and
now
it
is
inventing
the
wind
itself
is
crying
the
wind
itself
is
scolding
and
sobbing
and
the
wind
itself
is
laughing
the
rogue
but
if
you
think
that
this
rag
with
which
i
have
covered
the
window
is
a
sail
and
that
this
ruin
of
a
castle
is
a
brig
you
are
a
fool
we
are
not
going
anywhere
we
are
standing
securely
at
our
moorings
do
you
hear
he
pushes
the
sleeping
man
cautiously
get
up
noni
i
feel
lonesome
if
we
must
drink
let
s
drink
together
i
feel
lonesome
noni
haggart
awakens
stretches
himself
and
says
without
opening
his
eyes
here
it
something
to
here
it
is
a
fine
wind
noni
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
the
sea
splashed
into
my
eyes
it
is
high
tide
now
and
the
flies
up
to
the
tower
i
feel
lonesome
noni
i
want
to
speak
to
you
don
t
be
angry
it
s
soon
the
fire
will
burn
better
i
don
t
understand
your
actions
don
t
be
angry
noni
but
i
don
t
understand
your
actions
i
am
afraid
that
you
have
lost
your
did
you
drink
again
i
give
me
he
drinks
from
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
lying
on
the
floor
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
crooked
mutilated
walls
whose
every
projection
and
crack
is
now
lighted
by
the
bright
flame
in
the
fireplace
he
is
not
quite
sure
yet
whether
he
is
awake
or
whether
it
is
all
a
dream
with
each
strong
gust
of
wind
the
flame
is
hurled
from
the
fireplace
and
then
the
entire
tower
seems
to
dance
the
last
shadows
melt
and
rush
off
into
the
open
door
don
t
drink
it
all
at
once
noni
not
all
at
once
says
the
sailor
and
gently
takes
the
bottle
away
from
him
haggart
seats
himself
and
clasps
his
head
with
both
hands
i
have
a
headache
what
is
that
cry
was
there
a
shipwreck
no
noni
it
is
the
wind
playing
khorre
give
me
the
he
drinks
a
little
more
and
sets
the
bottle
on
the
table
then
he
paces
the
room
straightening
his
shoulders
and
his
chest
and
looks
out
of
the
window
khorre
looks
over
his
shoulder
and
whispers
not
a
single
light
it
is
dark
and
deserted
those
who
had
to
die
have
died
already
and
the
cautious
cowards
are
sitting
on
the
solid
haggart
turns
around
and
says
wiping
his
face
when
i
am
intoxicated
i
hear
voices
and
singing
does
that
happen
to
you
too
khorre
who
is
that
singing
now
the
wind
is
singing
noni
only
the
no
but
who
else
it
seems
to
me
a
human
being
is
singing
a
woman
is
singing
and
others
are
laughing
and
shouting
something
is
that
all
nothing
but
the
wind
only
the
why
does
the
wind
deceive
me
says
haggart
haughtily
it
feels
lonesome
noni
just
as
i
do
and
it
laughs
at
the
human
beings
have
you
heard
the
wind
lying
like
this
and
mocking
in
the
open
sea
there
it
tells
the
truth
but
here
it
frightens
the
people
on
shore
and
mocks
them
the
wind
does
not
like
cowards
you
know
haggart
says
morosely
i
heard
their
organist
playing
not
long
ago
in
church
he
they
are
all
no
exclaims
haggart
angrily
not
all
there
are
some
who
tell
the
truth
there
too
i
shall
cut
your
ears
off
if
you
will
slander
honest
people
do
you
hear
they
are
silent
they
listen
to
the
wild
music
of
the
sea
the
wind
has
evidently
grown
mad
having
taken
into
its
embrace
a
multitude
of
instruments
with
which
human
beings
produce
their
music
harps
priceless
violins
heavy
drums
and
brass
trumpets
it
breaks
them
all
together
with
a
wave
against
the
sharp
rocks
it
dashes
them
and
bursts
into
laughter
only
thus
does
the
wind
understand
music
each
time
in
the
death
of
an
instrument
each
time
in
the
breaking
of
strings
in
the
snapping
of
the
clanging
brass
thus
does
the
mad
musician
understand
music
haggart
heaves
a
deep
sigh
and
with
some
amazement
like
a
man
just
awakened
from
sleep
looks
around
on
all
sides
then
he
commands
shortly
give
me
my
here
it
both
commence
to
smoke
don
t
be
angry
noni
says
the
sailor
you
have
become
so
angry
that
one
can
t
come
near
you
at
all
may
i
chat
with
you
there
are
some
who
do
tell
the
truth
there
too
says
haggart
sternly
emitting
rings
of
smoke
how
shall
i
say
it
you
noni
answers
the
sailor
cautiously
but
stubbornly
there
are
no
truthful
people
there
it
has
been
so
ever
since
the
deluge
at
that
time
all
the
honest
people
went
out
to
sea
and
only
the
cowards
and
liars
remained
upon
the
solid
haggart
is
silent
for
a
minute
then
he
takes
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
laughs
gaily
have
you
invented
it
yourself
i
think
so
says
khorre
modestly
clever
and
it
was
worth
teaching
you
sacred
history
for
that
were
you
taught
by
a
priest
yes
in
prison
at
that
time
i
was
as
innocent
as
a
dove
that
s
also
from
sacred
scriptures
noni
that
s
what
they
always
say
he
was
a
fool
it
was
not
necessary
to
teach
you
but
to
hang
you
says
haggart
adding
morosely
don
t
talk
nonsense
sailor
hand
me
a
they
drink
khorre
stamps
his
foot
against
the
stone
floor
and
asks
do
you
like
this
motionless
floor
i
should
have
liked
to
have
the
deck
of
a
ship
dancing
under
my
noni
exclaims
the
sailor
enthusiastically
noni
now
i
hear
real
words

go
away
from
here
i
can
not
live
like
this
i
am
drowning
in

lost
your
mind

yourself
to
me
my
boy
i
was
your
nurse
i
nursed
you
noni
when
your
father
brought
you
on
board
ship
i
remember
how
the
city
was
burning
then
and
we
were
putting
out
to
sea
and
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
you
you
whined
like
a
little
pig
in
the
cook
s
room
i
even
wanted
to
throw
you
overboard
you
annoyed
me
so
much
ah
noni
it
is
all
so
touching
that
i
can
t
bear
to
recall
it
i
must
have
a
drink
take
a
drink
too
my
boy
but
not
all
at
once
not
all
at
once
they
drink
haggart
paces
the
room
heavily
and
slowly
like
a
man
who
is
imprisoned
in
a
dungeon
but
does
not
want
to
escape
i
feel
sad
he
says
without
looking
at
khorre
khorre
as
though
understanding
shakes
his
head
in
assent
sad
i
understand
since
then
ever
since
ever
since
we
drowned
those
people
they
cried
so
i
did
not
hear
their
cry
but
this
i
heard
something
snapped
in
my
heart
khorre
always
sadness
everywhere
sadness
let
me
drink
he
drinks
he
who
cried
am
i
perhaps
afraid
of
him
khorre
that
would
be
fine
tears
were
trickling
from
his
eyes
he
wept
like
one
who
is
unfortunate
why
did
he
do
that
perhaps
he
came
from
a
land
where
the
people
had
never
heard
of
death
what
do
you
think
sailor
i
don
t
remember
him
noni
you
speak
so
much
about
him
while
i
don
t
remember
he
was
a
fool
says
haggart
he
spoilt
his
death
for
himself
and
spoilt
me
my
life
i
curse
him
khorre
may
he
be
cursed
but
that
doesn
t
matter
khorre
no
silence
they
have
good
gin
on
this
coast
says
khorre
he
ll
pass
easily
noni
if
you
have
cursed
him
there
will
be
no
delay
he
ll
slip
into
hell
like
an
haggart
shakes
his
head
no
khorre

i
am
sad
ah
sailor
why
have
i
stopped
here
where
i
hear
the
sea
i
should
go
away
far
away
on
land
where
the
people
don
t
know
the
sea
at
all
where
the
people
have
never
heard
about
the
sea
a
thousand
miles
away
five
thousand
miles
away
there

khorre
that
organist

torn
by
the
storm

gloomily

captain
is
it
your
intention
to
return
to
the
ship

go
to
the
people
on
the
coast
and

your
actions
noni

police
dogs

and
not

getting
stronger
do

haggart
paces
the
room
in
agitation
striking
against
the

he
mutters
something
abruptly
suddenly
he
seizes
the
sail
and
tears
it
down
furiously
admitting
the
salty
wind
the
illumination
lamp
is
extinguished
and
the
flame
in

about
wildly

the
coasts
wherever

saw
you
in

the
sailor
sullenly
gathers
his
belongings
the
pouch
the
pipe
and
the
flask
and
wabbling
goes
off

he
does
not
go
far
he
sits

neighbouring
rock

the
work
is
ended
having
lost
its
gloss
the
last
neglected
fish
lies
on
the
ground
even
the
children
are
too
lazy
to
pick
it
up
and
an
indifferent
satiated
foot
treads
it
into
the
mud
a
quiet
fatigued
conversation
goes
on
mingled
with
gay
and
peaceful
laughter
what
kind
of
a
prayer
is
our
abbot
going
to
say
it
is
already
time
for
him
to
and
do
you
think
it
is
so
easy
to
compose
a
good
prayer
he
is
selly
s
basket
broke
and
the
fish
were
falling
out
we
laughed
so
much
it
seems
so
funny
to
me
even
now

two
fishermen
look
at
the
sail
in
the
distance
all
my
life
i
have
seen
large
ships
sailing
past
us
where
are
they
going

disappear
beyond
the
horizon
and
i
go
off
to
sleep
and

sleep
while

are
forever
going
going
where
are
they
going

should
like
to
go
with
them
when

my
heart

to
ring

purpose
or

truth
several
old
women

sailor
is
displeased

wan
his
face

looks
like

is
compelled
to
listen
to
a
psalm
but
i
don

like
wild
gart

resume
their
whispers
haggart
complains
softly

you
the
same
name

a
truthful
mariet

asks
mariet
sadly
the
abbot
and
old
dan

the
abbot
says
in
a
loud
deep
voice
here
i
am
here
i
am
bringing
you
a
prayer
children
i
have
just
composed
it
it
has
even
made
me
feel
hot
dan
why
doesn
t
the
boy
ring
the
bell
oh
yes
he
is
ringing
the
fool
he
isn
t
swinging
the
right
rope
but
that
doesn
t
matter
that
s
good
enough
too
isn
t
it
mariet
two
thin
but
merry
bells
are
ringing
mariet
is
silent
and
haggart
answers
for
her
that
s
good
enough
but
what
are
the
bells
saying
abbot
the
fishermen
who
have
gathered
about
them
are
already
prepared
to
laugh
the
same
undying
jest
is
always
repeated
will
you
tell
no
one
about
it
says
the
abbot
in
a
deep
voice
slily
winking
his
eye
pope
s
a
rogue
pope
s
a
rogue
the
fishermen
laugh
merrily
this
man
roars
the
abbot
pointing
at
haggart
is
my
favourite
man
he
has
given
me
a
grandson
and
i
wrote
the
pope
about
it
in
latin
but
that
wasn
t
so
hard
isn
t
that
true
mariet
but
he
knows
how
to
look
at
the
water
he
foretells
a
storm
as
if
he
himself
caused
it
gart
do
you
produce
the
storm
yourself
where
does
the
wind
come
from
you
are
the
wind
all
laugh
approval
an
old
fisherman
says
that
s
true
father
ever
since
he
has
been
here
we
have
never
been
caught
in
a
of
course
it
is
true
if
i
say
it
pope
s
a
rogue
pope

a
rogue
old
dan
walks
over
to
khorre
and
says
something
to
him
khorre
nods
his
head
negatively
the
abbot
singing
pope
s
a
rogue
goes
around
the
crowd
throws
out
brief
remarks
and
claps
some
people
on
the
shoulder
in
a
friendly
manner
hello
katerina
you
are
getting
stout
oho
are
you
all
ready
and
thomas
is
missing
again
this
is
the
second
time

has
stayed
away
from
prayer
anna
you
are
rather
sad
that
isn
t
good
one
must
live
merrily
one
must
live
merrily
i
think
that
it
is
jolly
even
in
hell
but
in
a
different
way
it
is
two
years
since
you
have
stopped
growing
philipp
that
isn
t
philipp
answers
gruffly
grass
also
stops
growing
if
a
stone
falls
upon
what
is
still
worse
than
that
worms
begin
to
breed
under
the
mariet
says
softly
sadly
and
entreatingly
don
t
you
want
me
to
call
you
mariet
haggart
answers
obstinately
and
sternly
i
don
t
if
my
name
will
be
mariet
i
shall
never
kill
that
man
he
disturbs
my
life
make
me
a
present
of
his
life
mariet
he
kissed
how
can
i
present
you
that
which
is
not
mine
his
life
belongs
to
god
and
to
that
is
not
true
he
kissed
you
do
i
not
see
the
burns
upon
your
lips
let
me
kill
him
and
you
will
feel
as
joyful
and
as
a
seagull
say
yes
no
you
shouldn
t
do
it
gart
it
will
be
painful
to
haggart
looks
at
her
and
speaks
with
deep
irony
is
that
it
well
then
it
is
not
true
that
you
give
me
anything
you
don
t
know
how
to
give
i
am
your
no
a
man
has
no
wife
when
another
man
and
not
his
wife
grinds
his
knife
my
knife
is
dull
mariet
mariet
looks
at
him
with
horror
and
sorrow
what
did
you
say
haggart
wake
up
it
is
a
terrible
dream
haggart
it
is
i
look
at
me
open
your
eyes
wider
wider
until
you
see
me
well
do
you
see
me
gart
haggart
slowly
rubs
his
brow
i
don
t
know
it
is
true
i
love
you
mariet
but
how
incomprehensible
your
land
is
in
your
land
a
man
sees
dreams
even
when
he
is
not
asleep
perhaps
i
am
smiling
already
look
the
abbot
stops
in
front
of
khorre
ah
old
friend
how
do
you
do
you
are
smiling
already
look
i
don
t
want
to
work
ejaculates
the
sailor
sternly
you
want
your
own
way
this
man
roars
the
abbot
pointing
at
khorre
thinks
that
he
is
an
atheist
but
he
is
simply
a
fool
he
does
not
understand
that
he
is
also
praying
to
god
but
he
is
doing
it
the
wrong
way
like
a
crab
even
a
fish
prays
to
god
my
children
i
have
seen
it
myself
when
you
will
be
in
hell
old
man
give
my
regards
to
the
pope
well
children
come
closer
and
don
t
gnash
your
teeth
i
am
going
to
start
at
once
eh
you
mathias
you
needn
t
put
out
the
fire
in
your
pipe
isn
t
it
the
same
to
god
what
smoke
it
is
incense
or
tobacco
if
it
is
only
well
meant
why
do
you
shake
your
head
woman
woman
his
tobacco
is
contraband
young
fisherman
god
wouldn
t
bother
with
such
trifles
the
abbot
thinks
a
while
no
hold
on
i
think
contraband
tobacco
is
not
quite
so
good
that
s
an
inferior
grade
look
here
you
better
drop
your
pipe
meanwhile
mathias
i
ll
think
the
matter
over
later
now
silence
perfect
silence
let
god
take
a
look
at
us
all
stand
silent
and
serious
only
a
few
have
lowered
their
heads
most
of
the
people
are
looking
ahead
with
motionless
eyes
as
though
they
really
saw
god
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
in
the
boundless
radiant
distant
surface
of
the
sea
the
sea
is
approaching
with
a
caressing
murmur
high
tide
has
set
in
my
god
and
the
god
of
all
these
people
don
t
judge
us
for
praying
not
in
latin
but
in
our
own
language
which
our
mothers
have
taught
us
our
god
save
us
from
all
kinds
of
terrors
from
unknown
sea
monsters
protect
us
against
storms
and
hurricanes
against
tempests
and
gales
give
us
calm
weather
and
a
kind
wind
a
clear
sun
and
peaceful
waves
and
another
thing
o
lord
we
ask
you
don
t
allow
the
devil
to
come
close
to
our
bedside
when
we
are
asleep
in
our
sleep
we
are
defenceless
o
lord
and
the
devil
terrifies
us
tortures
us
to
convulsions
torments
us
to
the
very
blood
of
our
heart
and
there
is
another
thing
o
lord
old
rikke
whom
you
know
is
beginning
to
extinguish
your
light
in
his
eyes
and
he
can
make
nets
no
longer
rikke
frequently
shakes
his
head
in
assent
i
can
t
i
can
t
prolong
then
o
lord
your
bright
day
and
bid
the
night
wait
am
i
right
rikke
and
here
is
still
another
the
last
request
o
lord
i
shall
not
ask
any
more
the
tears
do
not
dry
up
in
the
eyes
of
our
old
women
crying
for
those
who
have
perished
take
their
memory
away
o
lord
and
give
them
strong
forgetfulness
there
are
still
other
trifles
o
lord
but
let
the
others
pray
whose
turn
has
come
before
you
silence
old
dan
tugs
the
abbot
by
the
sleeve
and
whispers
something
in
his
ear
abbot
dan
is
asking
me
to
pray
for
those
who
perished
at
sea
the
women
exclaim
in
plaintive
chorus
for
those
who
perished
at
sea
for
those
who
died
at
sea
some
of
them
kneel
the
abbot
looks
tenderly
at
their
bowed
heads
exhausted
with
waiting
and
fear
and
says
no
priest
should
pray
for
those
who
died
at
sea
these
women
should
pray
make
it
so
o
lord
that
they
should
not
weep
so
much
silence
the
incoming
tide
roars
more
loudly
the
ocean
is
carrying
to
the
earth
its
noise
its
secrets
its
bitter
briny
taste
of
unexplored
depths
soft
voices
say
the
sea
is
high

says
the
priest
tenderly

isn

it
strange
that
this
a
woman
he
strokes
his
daughter
tenderly
with
his
finger
on
her
pure
forehead
should
be
born
of
me
a
man
haggart
smiles
and
is
it
not
strange
that
this
should
have
become
a
wife
to
me

man
he
embraces
mariet
bending
her
frail
shoulders
let
us
go

around
silently

the
distance

not

stay
there
and

son
says
the
priest
in

deep
whisper

rat

puts
something
away
for
him
in
the
closet
for
the
night
when

two
old
men
seated
in
a
friendly
manner
on
two
neighbouring
rocks

on
the
deserted
shore
and
the
old
men
resemble
each
other
so
closely

whatever
they
may
say

each
other

direction

and
stooping
khorre
is
left
alone
before
the
entire
vastness
of
the
sea
and
the
sky
he
is
gone
then
i
am
going
to
look
at
you
o
sea
until
my
eyes
will
burst
of
thirst
the
ocean
approaching
is
roaring
chapter
iv
at
the
very
edge
of
the
water
upon
a
narrow
landing
on
the
rocky
shore
stands
a
man
a
small
dark
motionless
dot
behind
him
is
the
cold
almost
vertical
slope
of
granite
and
before
his
eyes
the
ocean
is
rocking
heavily
and
dully
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
its
mighty
approach
is
felt
in
the
open
voice
of
the
waves
which
are
rising
from
the
depths
even
sniffing
sounds
are
heard
it
is
as
though
a
drove
of
monsters
playing
were
splashing
snorting
lying
down
on
their
backs
and
panting
contentedly
deriving
their
monstrous
pleasures
the
ocean
smells
of
the
strong
odour
of
the
depths
of
decaying
seaweeds
of
its
grass
the
sea
is
calm
and
as
always
alone
and
there
is
but
one
little
light
in
the
black
space
of
water
and
night
the
distant
lighthouse
of
the
holy
cross
the
rattle
of
cobblestones
is
heard
from
under
a
cautious
step
haggart
is
coming
down
to
the
sea
along
a
steep
path
he
pauses
silent
with
restraint
breathing
deeply
after
the
strain
of
passing
the
dangerous
slope
and
goes
forward
he
is
now
at
the
edge
he
straightens
himself
and
looks
for
a
long
time
at
him
who
had
long
before
taken
his
strange
but
customary
place
at
the
very
edge
of
the
deep
he
makes
a
few
steps
forward
and
greets
him
irresolutely
and
gently
haggart
greets
him
even
timidly
good
evening
stranger
have
you
been
here
long
a
sad
soft
and
grave
voice
answers
good
evening
haggart
yes
i
have
been
here
you
are
watching
i
am
watching
and
will
you
allow
me
to
stand
near
you
and
look
in
the
same
direction
you
are
looking
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
disturbing
you
by
my
uninvited
presence
for
when
i
came
you
were
already
here
but
i
am
so
fond
of
this
spot
this
place
is
isolated
and
the
sea
is
near
and
the
earth
behind
is
silent
and
here
my
eyes
open
like
a
i
see
better
in
the
dark
the
light
of
day
dazzles
me
you
know
i
have
grown
up
on
the
sea
no
you
are
not
disturbing
me
haggart
but
am
i
not
disturbing
you
then
i
shall
go
you
are
so
polite
sir
mutters
haggart
but
i
also
love
this
spot
continues
the
sad
grave
voice
i
too
like
to
feel
that
the
cold
and
peaceful
granite
is
behind
me
you
have
grown
up
on
the
sea
haggart
tell
me
what
is
that
faint
light
on
the
right
that
is
the
lighthouse
of
the
holy
aha
the
lighthouse
of
the
holy
cross
i
didn
t
know
that
but
can
such
a
faint
light
help
in
time
of
a
storm
i
look
and
it
always
seems
to
me
that
the
light
is
going
out
i
suppose
it
isn
t
haggart
agitated
but
restrained
says
you
frighten
me
sir
why
do
you
ask
me
what
you
know
better
than
i
do
you
want
to
tempt
me
you
know
there
is
not
a
trace
of
a
smile
in
the
mournful
voice
nothing
but
sadness
no
i
know
little
i
know
even
less
than
you
do
for
i
know
more
pardon
my
rather
complicated
phrase
haggart
but
the
tongue
responds
with
so
much
difficulty
not
only
to
our
feeling
but
also
to
our
you
are
polite
mutters
haggart
agitated
you
are
polite
and
always
calm
you
are
always
sad
and
you
have
a
thin
hand
with
rings
upon
it
and
you
speak
like
a
very
important
personage
who
are
you
sir
i
am
he
whom
you
called
the
one
who
is
always
when
i
come
you
are
already
here
when
i
go
away
you
remain
why
do
you
never
want
to
go
with
me
sir
there
is
one
way
for
you
haggart
and
another
for
i
see
you
only
at
night
i
know
all
the
people
around
this
settlement
and
there
is
no
one
who
looks
like
you
sometimes
i
think
that
you
are
the
owner
of
that
old
castle
where
i
lived
if
that
is
so
i
must
tell
you
the
castle
was
destroyed
by
the
i
don
t
know
of
whom
you
i
don
t
understand
how
you
know
my
name
haggart
but
i
don
t
want
to
deceive
you
although
my
wife
mariet
calls
me
so
i
invented
that
name
myself
i
have
another
name
my
real
name
of
which
no
one
has
ever
heard
i
know
your
other
name
also
haggart
i
know
your
third
name
too
which
even
you
do
not
know
but
it
is
hardly
worth
speaking
of
this
you
had
better
look
into
this
dark
sea
and
tell
me
about
your
life
is
it
true
that
it
is
so
joyous
they
say
that
you
are
forever
smiling
they
say
that
you
are
the
bravest
and
most
handsome
fisherman
on
the
coast
and
they
also
say
that
you
love
your
wife
mariet
very
o
sir
exclaims
haggart
with
restraint
my
life
is
so
sad
that
you
could
not
find
an
image
like
it
in
this
dark
deep
o
sir
my
sufferings
are
so
deep
that
you
could
not
find
a
more
terrible
place
in
this
dark
what
is
the
cause
of
your
sorrow
and
your
sufferings
haggart
life
sir
here
your
noble
and
sad
eyes
look
in
the
same
direction
my
eyes
look
into
this
terrible
dark
distance
tell
me
then
what
is
stirring
there
what
is
resting
and
waiting
there
what
is
silent
there
what
is
screaming
and
singing
and
complaining
there
in
its
own
voices
what
are
the
voices
that
agitate
me
and
fill
my
soul
with
phantoms
of
sorrow
and
yet
say
nothing
and
whence
comes
this
night
and
whence
comes
my
sorrow
are
you
sighing
sir
or
is
it
the
sigh
of
the
ocean
blending
with
your
voice
my
hearing
is
beginning
to
fail
me
my
master
my
dear
the
sad
voice
replies
it
is
my
sigh
haggart
my
great
sorrow
is
responding
to
your
sorrow
you
see
at
night
like
an
owl
haggart
then
look
at
my
thin
hands
and
at
my
rings
are
they
not
pale
and
look
at
my
face
is
it
not
pale
is
it
not
pale
is
it
not
pale
oh
haggart
my
dear
they
grieve
silently
the
heavy
ocean
is
splashing
tossing
about
spitting
and
snorting
and
sniffing
peacefully
the
sea
is
calm
and
alone
as
always
tell
haggart
says
the
sad
voice
very
well
i
will
tell
tell
haggart
that
i
love
silence
and
then
a
faint
plaintive
reproach
resounds
softly
if
your
voice
were
not
so
grave
sir
i
would
have
thought
that
you
were
laughing
at
me
am
i
not
haggart
that
i
should
tell
something
to
haggart
but
no
i
sense
a
different
meaning
in
your
words
and
you
frighten
me
again
and
when
haggart
is
afraid
it
is
real
terror
very
well
i
will
tell
haggart
everything
you
have
adjust
my
cloak
my
shoulder
is
cold
but
it
always
seems
to
me
that
the
light
over
there
is
going
out
you
called
it
the
lighthouse
of
the
holy
cross
if
i
am
not
mistaken
yes
it
is
called
so
aha
it
is
called
so
silence
must
i
go
now
asks
haggart
yes
and
you
will
remain
here
i
will
remain
haggart
retreats
several
steps
again
the
cobblestones
rattle
under
his
cautious
steps
without
looking
back
haggart
climbs
the
steep
rocks
of
what
great
sorrow
speaks
this
night
chapter
v
your
hands
are
in
blood
haggart
whom
have
you
killed
haggart
silence
khorre
i
killed
that
man

silent
and
listen

will
commence
to
play
soon
i
stood
here
and
listened
but
suddenly
my
heart
sank
and
i
can
not
stay
here
don
t
confuse
my
mind
noni
don
t
tempt
me
i
will
run
away
from

at
night
when
i
am
already
fast
asleep
you
swoop
down
on
me
like
a
demon
grab
me
by
the
neck
and
drag
me
over
here

can
t
understand
anything

boy

prating
about
i
have
nothing
to
throw
into
the
but
your
hands
are
in
silence

will
commence
soon

silent
and

to
you

he
drags
him
closer
to
the
dark
window
of
the
church
khorre
mutters
how
dark
it
is
if
you
raised
me
out
of
bed
for
this
accursed
music
yes

this
accursed
then
you
have
disturbed
my
honest
sleep
in

was
i
perhaps
to
run
through
the
street
knock
at
the
windows
and
shout
eh
who
is
there
where

a
living
soul

away
from

i
think
he
looked
at
us
from
the
window
something
white
flashed
behind
the
window
pane
you
may
laugh
khorre
if
he
came
out
now
i
would
scream
like
a
he

softly

dan
of
course

think
that
you
simply
drank
too

time

castle
and
your
hand
is
quivering
but
then
the
game
was
different

his
voice

your
hand
is
really
in
blood

silence
the
distant
breakers
are
softly
groaning
as
if
complaining
the
sea
has
gone
far
away
from
the
black
earth
and
the
night
is
silent
it
came
no
one
knows
whence
and
spread
over
the
earth
it
spread
over
the
earth
and
is
silent

waiting
for
something
and
ferocious
mists
have
swung
themselves
to
meet

phantoms
driving
to
the
earth
a
herd
of
headless
submissive
giants
a
heavy
fog
is
coming
why

light
a
lamp

khorre
sternly
but
submissively
he
needs
no

no

sounds
of

organ

is
sitting
alone
in

dark
and
is
speaking
to
god
in
an
incomprehensible
language
about
the
most
important
things
and
however
faint
the
sounds
suddenly
the
silence
vanishes
the
night
trembles
and
stares
into
the
dark
church
with
all
its
myriads
of
phantom
eyes
an
agitated
voice
whispers

always
begins
that
way

he
stops
speaking
the
organ
sings
solemnly
why

the
sailor
with
alarm

listening
and
you

talking
the
musician
may
feel
offended
he
laughs
quietly
brass
trumpets
are
roaring
harmoniously
about
the
triumphant
conciliation
between
man
and
god
the
fog
is
growing
thicker
a
loud
stamping
of
feet
some
one
runs
through
the
deserted
street
in
agitation
noni
whispers
the
sailor
who
ran
by
i
noni
another
one
is
running
something
is
frightened
people
are
running
about
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
echo
of
the
night
doubles
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
increasing
their
terror
tenfold
and
it
seems
as
if
the
entire
village
is
running
away
somewhere
rocking
dancing
silently
as
upon
waves
a
lantern
floats
by
they
have
found
him
khorre
they
have
found
the
man
i
killed
sailor
i
did
not
throw
him
into
the
sea
i
brought
him
and
set
his
head
up
against
the
door
of
his
house
they
have
found
another
lantern
floats
by
swinging
from
side
to
side
as
if
hearing
the
alarm
the
organ
breaks
off
at
a
high
chord
an
instant
of
silence
emptiness
of
dread
waiting
and
then
a
woman
s
sob
of
despair
fills
it
up
to
the
brim
the
mist
is
growing
thicker
chapter
vi
the
flame
in
the
is
dying
out
having
a
smell
of
burning
it
is
near
sunrise
a
large
clean
fisherman
s
hut
a
skilfully
made
little
ship
is
fastened
to
the
ceiling
and
even
the
sails
are
set
involuntarily
this
little
ship
has
somehow
become
the
centre
of
attraction
and
all
those
who
speak
who
are
silent
and
who
listen
look
at
it
study
each
familiar
sail
behind
the
dark
curtain
lies
the
body
of
philipp
this
hut
belonged
to
him
the
people
are
waiting
for
haggart
some
have
gone
out
to
search
for
him
on
the
benches
along
the
walls
the
old
fishermen
have
seated
themselves
their
hands
folded
on
their
knees
some
of
them
seem
to
be
slumbering
others
are
smoking
their
pipes
they
speak
meditatively
and
cautiously
as
though
eager
to
utter
no
unnecessary
words
whenever
a
belated
fisherman
comes
in
he
looks
first
at
the
curtain
then
he
silently
squeezes
himself
into
the
crowd
and
those
who
have
no
place
on
the
bench
apparently
feel
embarrassed
the
abbot
paces
the
room
heavily
his
hands
folded
on
his
back
his
head
lowered
when
any
one
is
in
his
way
he
quietly
pushes
him
aside
with
his
hand
he
is
silent
and
knits
his
brows
convulsively
occasionally
he
glances
at
the
door
or
at
the
window
and
listens
the
only
woman
present
there
is
mariet
she
is
sitting
by
the
table
and
constantly
watching
her
father
with
her
burning
eyes
she
shudders
slightly
at
each
loud
word
at
the
sound
of
the
door
as
it
opens
at
the
noise
of
distant
footsteps
at
night
a
fog
came
from
the
sea
and
covered
the
earth
and
such
perfect
quiet
reigns
now
that
tolling
is
heard
in
the
distant
lighthouse
of
the
holy
cross
warning
is
thus
given
to
the
ships
that
have
lost
their
way
in
the
fog
some
one
in
the
corner
says
judging
from
the
blow
it
was
not
one
of
our
people
that
killed
him
our
people
can
t
strike
like
that
he
stuck
the
knife
here
then
slashed
over
there
and
almost
cut
his
head
you
can
t
do
that
with
a
dull
knife
no
you
can
t
do
it
with
a
weak
hand
i
saw
a
murdered
sailor
on
the
wharf
one
day
he
was
cut
up
just
like
silence
and
where
is
his
mother
asks
some
one
nodding
at
the
curtain
selly
is
taking
care
of
her
selly
took
her
to
her
an
old
fisherman
quietly
asks
his
neighbour
who
told
you
francina
woke
me
who
told
you
marle
some
one
knocked
on
my
who
knocked
on
your
window
i
don
t
silence
how
is
it
you
don
t
know
who
was
the
first
to
see
some
one
passed
by
and
noticed
none
of
us
passed
by
there
was
nobody
among
us
who
passed
a

he
turns
to
the
window
an
elderly
fisherman
enters
and
forces
himself
silently
into
the
line
well
tibo
asks
the
abbot
stopping

t
you
found
haggart

it
is
so
foggy
that
they
are
afraid
of
losing
themselves
they
walk
and
call
each
other
some
of
them
hold
each
other
by
the
hand
even
a
lantern
can
t
be
seen
ten
feet
the
abbot
lowers
his
head
and
resumes
his
pacing
the
old
fisherman
speaks
without
addressing
any
one
in
particular
there
are
many
ships

staring
helplessly
in
the
i
walked
like
a
blind
man

tibo
i
heard
the
holy
cross
ringing
but
it
seems
as
if
it
changed
its
place
the
sound
comes
from
the
left
the
fog
is
old
desfoso
says

abbot
stops

says
the
abbot
and
resumes
pacing
the
room
then
dugamel
threw
himself
into
the
sea
from
a
rock
and
was
dashed
to
death
that
s
how
it
happened
he
threw
himself
mariet
shudders
and
looks
at
the
speaker
with
hatred
silence
what
did

say
thomas
thomas
takes
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth

there
philipp
was
sitting
at
his
door

about

night
ever
since

stops
irresolutely
mariet

frankly
and
heavily
since

i
said
to
him
why

you
knock
philipp

but
he

and
he
was
silent
he
was
silent
if
you
don
t
want
anything
you
had
better
go
to
sleep
my
friend
said
i
but
he
was
silent
then
i
looked
at
him
his
throat
was
cut
mariet
shudders
and
looks
at
the
speaker
with
aversion
silence
another
fisherman
enters
looks
at
the
curtain
and
silently
forces
his
way
into
the
crowd
women
s
voices
are
heard
behind
the
door
the
abbot
stops
eh
lebon
chase
the
women
away
he
says
tell
them
there
is
nothing
for
them
to

lebon

the
abbot

women
abbot
and
your
daughter
she
is
the
abbot
looks
at
mariet
she
says
i
am
not
going
away
from
silence
the
abbot
paces
the
room
again
he
looks
at
the
little
ship
fastened
to
the
ceiling
and
asks
who
made
it
all
look
at
the
little
ship
he
answers
desfoso
he
made
it
when
he
wanted
to
go
to
america
as
a
sailor
he
was
always
asking
me
how
a
brig
is
fitted
they
look
at
the
ship
again
at
its
perfect
little
sails
at
the
little
rags
lebon
returns
i
don
t
know
how
to
tell
you
about
it
abbot
the
women
say
that
haggart
and
his
sailor
are
being
led
over
here
the
women
are
mariet
shudders
and
looks
at
the
door
the
abbot
pauses
oho
it
is
daybreak
already
the
fog
is
turning
blue
says
one
fisherman
to
another
but
his
voice
breaks
off
yes
low
tide
has
started
replies
the
other
dully
silence
then
uneven
footsteps
resound
several
young
fishermen
with
excited
faces
bring
in
haggart
who
is
bound
and
push
khorre
in
after
him
also
bound
haggart
is
calm
as
soon
as
the
sailor
was
bound
something
wildly
free
appeared
in
his
movements
in
his
manners
in
the
sharpness
of
his
swift
glances
one
of
the
men
who
brought
haggart
says
to
the
abbot
in
a
low
voice
he
was
near
the
church
ten
times
we
passed
by
and
saw
no
one
until
he
called
aren
t
you
looking
for
me
it
is
so
foggy
the
abbot
shakes
his
head
silently
and
sits
down
mariet
smiles
to
her
husband
with
her
pale
lips
but
he
does
not
look
at
her
like
all
the
others
he
has
fixed
his
eyes
in
amazement
on
the
toy
ship
hello
haggart
says
the
abbot
hello
you
call
me
father
yes
you
are
mistaken
haggart
i
am
not
your
the
fishermen
exchanged
glances
contentedly
well
then
hello
abbot
says
haggart
with
indifference
and
resumes
examining
the
little
ship
khorre
mutters
that
s
the
way
be
firm
who
made
this
toy
asks
haggart
but
no
one
replies
hello
gart
says
mariet
smiling
it
is
i
your
wife
mariet
let
me
untie
your
with
a
smile
pretending
that
she
does
not
notice
the
stains
of
blood
she
unfastens
the
ropes
all
look
at
her
in
silence
haggart
also
looks
at
her
bent
alarmed
head
thank
you
he
says
straightening
his
hands
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
untie
my
hands
too
said
khorre
but
there
is
no
answer
abbot
haggart
did
you
kill
philipp
haggart
abbot
do
you
mean
to
say
eh
you
haggart
that
you
yourself
killed
him
with
your
own
hands
perhaps
you
said
to
the
sailor
sailor
go
and
kill
philipp
and
he
did
it
for
he
loves
you
and
respects
you
as
his
superior
perhaps
it
happened
that
way
tell
me
haggart
i
called
you
my
son
haggart
haggart
no
i
did
not
order
the
sailor
to
do
it
i
killed
philipp
with
my
own
hand
silence
khorre
noni
tell
them
to
unfasten
my
hands
and
give
me
back
my
pipe
don
t
be
in
a
hurry
roars
the
priest
be
bound
awhile
drunkard
you
had
better
be
afraid
of
an
untied
rope
it
may
be
formed
into
a
but
obeying
a
certain
swift
movement
or
glance
of
haggart
mariet
walks
over
to
the
sailor
and
opens
the
knots
of
the
rope
and
again
all
look
in
silence
upon
her
bent
alarmed
head
then
they
turn
their
eyes
upon
haggart
just
as
they
looked
at
the
little
ship
before
so
they
now
look
at
him
and
he
too
has
forgotten
about
the
toy
as
if
aroused
from
sleep
he
surveys
the
fishermen
and
stares
long
at
the
dark
curtain
abbot
haggart
i
am
asking
you
who
carried
philipp
s
body
haggart
i
brought
it
and
put
it
near
the
door
his
head
against
the
door
his
face
against
the
sea
it
was
hard
to
set
him
that
way
he
was
always
falling
down
but
i
did
it
abbot
why
did
you
do
it
haggart
i
don
t
know
exactly
i
heard
that
philipp
has
a
mother
an
old
woman
and
i
thought
this
might
please
them
better
both
him
and
his
mother
abbot
with
restraint
you
are
laughing
at
us
haggart
no
what
makes
you
think
i
am
laughing
i
am
just
as
serious
as
you
are
did
he
did
philipp
make
this
little
ship
no
one
answers
mariet
rising
and
bending
over
to
haggart
across
the
table
says
didn
t
you
say
this
haggart
my
poor
boy
i
killed
you
because
i
had
to
kill
you
and
now
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
your
mother
my
dear
boy
these
are
very
sad
words
who
told
them
to
you
mariet
asks
haggart
surprised
i
heard
them
and
didn
t
you
say
further
mother
i
have
brought
you
your
son
and
put
him
down
at
your
door
take
your
boy
mother
haggart
maintains
silence
i
don
t
know
roars
the
abbot
bitterly
i
don
t
know
people
don
t
kill
here
and
we
don
t
know
how
it
is
done
perhaps
that
is
as
it
should
be
to
kill
and
then
bring
the
murdered
man
to
his
mother
s
threshold
what
are
you
gaping
at
you
scarecrow
khorre
replies
rudely
according
to
my
opinion
he
should
have
thrown
him
into
the
sea
your
haggart
is
out
of
his
mind
i
have
said
it
long
suddenly
old
desfoso
shouts
amid
the
loud
approval
of
the
others
hold
your
tongue
we
will
send
him
to
the
city
but
we
will
hang
you
like
a
cat
ourselves
even
if
you
did
not
kill
silence
old
man
silence
the
abbot
stops
him
while
khorre
looks
over
their
heads
with
silent
contempt
haggart
i
am
asking
you
why
did
you
take
philipp
s
life
he
needed
his
life
just
as
you
need
he
was
mariet
s
betrothed
and
well
and
i
don
t
want
to
speak
why
didn
t
you
ask
me
before
when
he
was
alive
now
i
have
killed
but
says
the
abbot
and
there
is
a
note
of
entreaty
in
his
heavy
voice
but
it
may
be
that
you
are
already
repenting
haggart
you
are
a
splendid
man
gart
i
know
you
when
you
are
sober
you
can
not
hurt
even
a
fly
perhaps
you
were
intoxicated
that
happens
with
young
people
and
philipp
may
have
said
something
to
you
and
you
no
well
then
let
it
be
no
am
i
not
right
children
but
perhaps
something
strange
came
over
you
it
happens
with
people
suddenly
a
red
mist
will
get
into
a
man
s
head
the
beast
will
begin
to
howl
in
his
breast
and
in
such
cases
one
word
is
enough
no
philipp
did
not
say
anything
to
me
he
passed
along
the
road
when
i
jumped
out
from
behind
a
large
rock
and
stuck
a
knife
into
his
throat
he
had
no
time
even
to
be
scared
but
if
you
like
haggart
surveys
the
fishermen
with
his
eyes
irresolutely
i
feel
a
little
sorry
for
him
that
is
just
a
little
did
he
make
this
toy
the
abbot
lowers
his
head
sternly
and
desfoso
shouts
again
amidst
sobs
of
approval
from
the
others
no
abbot
you
better
ask
him
what
he
was
doing
at
the
church
dan
saw
them
from
the
window
wouldn
t
you
tell
us
what
you
and
your
accursed
sailor
were
doing
at
the
church
what
were
you
doing
there
haggart
looks
at
the
speaker
steadfastly
and
says
slowly
i
talked
with
the
a
muffled
rumbling
follows
the
abbot
jumps
from
his
place
and
roars
furiously
then
let
him
sit
on
your
neck
eh
pierre
jules
tie
him
down
as
fast
as
you
can
until
morning
and
the
other
one
too
and
in
the
morning
in
the
morning
take
him
away
to
the
city
to
the
judges
i
don
t
know
their
accursed
city
laws
cries
the
abbot
in
despair
but
they
will
hang
you
haggart
you
will
dangle
on
a
rope
haggart
khorre
rudely
pushes
aside
the
young
fisherman
who
comes
over
to
him
with
a
rope
and
says
to
desfoso
in
a
low
voice
it
s
an
important
matter
old
man
go
away
for
a
minute
he
oughtn
t
to
hear
it
he
nods
at
haggart
i
don
t

a
little
matter

have
no
the
people
step
aside
and
whisper
haggart
is
silently
waiting
to
be
bound
but
no
one
comes
over
to
him
all
shudder
when
mariet
suddenly
commences
to
speak
perhaps
you
think
that
all
this
is
just
father
why
then
don
t
you
ask
me
about
it
i
am
his
wife
don
t

he
is
sleeping
but
i
will
wake
him
up
once
in
his
life

may
wake
up
at
night
in
order
to
say
that
this
man
whom
you
want
to
hang
in
the
city

his

haggart
very
well

mariet
obediently

i
must
obey
he
is
my
husband

little
noni
sleep
but
i

mariet
how
was
it
possible
that
your
husband
haggart
should
kill
philipp
silence
desfoso
who
has
returned
and
who
is
agitated
decides
let
her
speak

is
his
you
will
not
believe
desfoso
says
mariet
turning
to
the
old
fisherman
with
a
tender
and
mournful
smile
desfoso
you
will
not
believe
what
strange
and
peculiar
creatures
we
women
are
turning
to
all
the
people
with
the
same
smile
she
continues
you
will
not
believe
what
queer
desires
what
cunning
malicious
little
thoughts
we
women
have
it
was
i
who
persuaded
my
husband
to
kill
philipp
yes
yes
he
did
not
want
to
do
it
but
i
urged
him
i
cried
so
much
and
threatened
him
so
he
consented
men
always
give
in
isn
t
that
true
desfoso
haggart
looks
at
his
wife
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
his
eyebrows
brought
close
to
each
other
mariet
continues
without
looking
at
him
still
smiling
as
before
you
will
ask
me
why
i
wanted
philipp
s
death
yes
yes
you
will
ask
this
question
i
know
it
he
never
did
me
any
harm
that
poor
philipp
isn
t
that
true
then
i
will
tell
you
he
was
my
betrothed
i
don
t
know
whether
you
will
be
able
to
understand
me
you
old
desfoso
you
would
not
kill
the
girl
you
kissed
one
day
of
course
not
but
we
women
are
such
strange
creatures
you
can
t
even
imagine
what
strange
suspicious
peculiar
creatures
we
are
philipp
was
my
betrothed
and
he
kissed
me
she
wipes
her
mouth
and
continues
laughing
here
i
am
wiping
my
mouth
even
now
you
have
all
seen
how
i
wiped
my
mouth
i
am
wiping
away
philipp
s
kisses
you
are
laughing
but
ask
your
wife
desfoso
does
she
want
the
life
of
the
man
who
kissed
her
before
you
ask
all
women
who
love
even
the
old
women
we
never
grow
old
in
love
we
are
born
so
we
haggart
almost
believes
her
advancing
a
step
forward
he
asks

t
mariet

say
perhaps
that

mariet
haggart
interrupts
her
threateningly

pale
looking
sorrowfully
at
his
terrible
eyes
which
are
now
steadfastly
fixed
upon
her

still
smiling

in
the
marketplace
in
one
hand
you
have
truth
and
in
the
other
hand
you
have
truth
and
you
are
forever
performing
tricks
and
now
she
is
lying
she
lies
so
well
that
my
heart
contracts
with
belief
oh
she
is
doing
it
well
and
he
laughs
bitterly
mariet
forgive
me
gart
haggart
when
i
wanted
to
kill
him
she
hung
on
my
hand
like
a
rock
and
now
she
says
that
she
killed
him
she
steals
from
me
this
murder
she
does
not
know
that
one
has
to
earn
that
too
oh
there
are
queer
people
in
your
land
i
wanted
to
deceive
them
not
you
gart
i
wanted
to
save
you
says
mariet
haggart
replies
my
father
taught
me
eh
noni
beware
there
is
one
truth
and
one
law
for
all
for
the
sun
for
the
wind
for
the
waves
for
the
beasts
and
only
for
man
there
is
another
truth
beware
of
this
truth
of
man
noni
so
said
my
father
perhaps
this
is
your
truth
then
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
but
i
feel
very
sad
and
very
embittered
mariet
if
you
sharpened
my
knife
and
said
go
and
kill
that
man
it
may
be
that
i
would
not
have
cared
to
kill
him
what
is
the
use
of
cutting
down
a
withered
tree
i
would
have
said
but
now
farewell
mariet
well
bind
me
and
take
me
to
the
he
waits
haughtily
but
no
one
approaches
him
mariet
has
lowered
her
head
upon
her
hands
her
shoulders
are
twitching
the
abbot
is
also
absorbed
in
thought
his
large
head
lowered
desfoso
is
carrying
on
a
heated
conversation
in
whispers
with
the
fishermen
khorre
steps
forward
and
speaks
glancing
at
haggart
askance
i
had
a
little
talk
with
them
noni
they
are
all

the
priest
but
he
is
a
good
man
too
am
i
right
noni
don
t
look
so
crossly
at
me
or
i
ll
mix
up
the
whole
thing
you
see
kind
people
it
s
this
way
this
man
haggart
and
i
have
saved
up
a
little
sum
of
money
a
little
barrel
of
gold
we
don
t
need
it
noni

we
perhaps
you
will
take
it
for
yourselves
what
do
you
think
shall
we
give
them
the
gold
noni
you
see
here
i
ve
entangled
myself
he

slyly
at
mariet
who
has
now
lifted
her
head
what
are
you
prating
there
you
scarecrow
asks
the
abbot
khorre
continues
here

by
little
but
where

barrel
do
you
remember
noni
i
have
forgotten
they
say
it

from
the
gin
kind
people
they
say
that
one
s
memory
fails
from
too
much
gin
i
am
a
drunkard
that
s
if
you
are
not
inventing
then
you
had
better
choke
yourself
with
your
gold
you
dog
says
the
abbot
haggart
khorre
khorre
yes
haggart
you
will
get
a
hundred
lashes
abbot

hundred
lashes
for
him
abbot
with
pleasure
my
son
with
pleasure
the
movements
of
the
fishermen
are
just
as
slow
and
languid
but
there
is
something
new
in
their
increased
puffing
and
pulling
at
their
pipes
in
the
light
quiver
of
their
tanned
hands
some
of
them
arise
and
look
out
of
the
window
with
feigned
indifference
the
fog
is
rising
says
one
looking
out
of
the
window
do
you
hear
what
i
said
about
the
fog
it
s
time
to
go
to
sleep
i
say
it
s
time
to
go
to
sleep
desfoso
comes
forward
and
speaks
cautiously
that
isn
t
quite
so
abbot
it
seems
you
didn
t
say
exactly
what
you
ought
to
say
abbot
they
seem
to
think
differently
i
don
t
say
anything
for
myself
i
am
simply
talking
about
them
what
do
you
say
thomas
thomas
we
ought
to
go
to
sleep
i
say
isn
t
it
true
that
it
is
time
to
go
to
sleep
mariet
softly
sit
down
gart
you
are
tired
you
don
t
answer
an
old
fisherman
says
there
used
to
be
a
custom
in
our
land
i
heard
that
a
murderer
was
to
pay
a
fine
for
the
man
he
killed
have
you
heard
about
it
desfoso
another
voice
is
heard
philipp
is
dead
philipp
is
dead
already
do
you
hear
neighbour
who
is
going
to
support
his
mother
i
haven
t
enough
even
for
my
own
and
the
fog
is
rising
abbot
did

hear
us

a
bad
man
gart
is
a
a
city
trickster
no
we
said
this
thing
has
never
happened
here

says
desfoso
then
a
determined
voice
remarks
gart
is
a
good
man
wild
gart
is
a
good
man
desfoso
if
you
looked
around
abbot
you
couldn
t
find
a
single
strong
boat
here
i
haven
t
enough
tar
for
mine
and
the
church
is
that
the
way
a
good
church
ought
to
look
i
am
not
saying
it
myself
but
it
comes
out
that
way
it
can
t
be
helped
abbot
haggart
turns
to
mariet
and
says
do
you
hear
woman
i
why
don
t
you
spit
into
their
faces
i
can
t
i
love
you
haggart
are
there
only
ten
commandments
of
god
no
there
is
still
another
i
love
you
what
sad
dreams
there
are
in
your
the
abbot
rises
and
walks
over
to
the
fishermen
well
what
did
you
say
about
the
church
old
man
you
said
something
interesting
about
the
church
or
was
i
mistaken
he
casts
a
swift
glance
at
mariet
and
haggart
it
isn
t
the
church
alone
abbot
there
are
four
of
us
old
men
legran
stoffle
puasar
kornu
and
seven
old
women
do
i
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
feed
them
of
course
we
will
but
don
t
be
angry
father
it
is
hard
you
know
it
yourself
abbot
old
age
is
no
i
am
an
old
man
too
begins
old
rikke
lisping
but
suddenly
he
flings
his
hat
angrily
to
the
ground
yes
i
am
an
old
man
i
don
t
want
any
more
that
s
all
i
worked
and
now
i
don
t
want
to
work
that
s
all
i
don
t
want
to
he
goes
out
swinging
his
hand
all
look
sympathetically
at
his
stooping
back
at
his
white
tufts
of
hair
and
then
they
look
again
at
desfoso
at
his
mouth
from
which
their
words
come
out
a
voice
says
there
rikke
doesn
t
want
to
work
any
all
laugh
softly
and
forcedly
suppose
we
send
gart
to
the
city
what
then
desfoso
goes
on
without
looking
at
haggart
well
the
city
people
will
hang
him
and
then
what
the
result
will
be
that
a
man
will
be
gone
a
fisherman
will
be
gone
you
will
lose
a
son
and
mariet
will
lose
her
husband
and
the
little
boy
his
father
is
there
any
joy
in
that
that
s
right
that
s
right
nods
the
abbot
approvingly
but
what
a
mind
you
have
desfoso
do
you
pay
attention
to
them
abbot
asked
haggart
yes
i
do
haggart
and
it
wouldn
t
do
you
any
harm
to
pay
attention
to
them
the
devil
is
prouder
than
you
and
yet
he
is
only
the
devil
and
nothing
desfoso
affirms
what
s
the
use
of
pride
pride
isn
t
he
turns
to
haggart
his
eyes
still
lowered
then
he
lifts
his
eyes
and
asks
gart
but
you
don
t
need
to
kill
anybody
else
excepting
philipp
you
don
t
feel
like
killing
anybody
else
do
you
only
philipp
and
no
more
do
you
hear
only
philipp
and
no
more
and
another
question
gart
don
t
you
want
to
send

man
khorre
we
would
like
you

all
this
trouble
comes
through
several
voices

heard
through
him

it
will
be
better
for

the
abbot
upholds
them
true

too
priest
says
khorre
gruffly
haggart
looks
with
a
faint
smile
at
his
angry
bristled
face
and
says
i
rather
feel
like
sending
him
away
let
him
well
then
abbot
says
desfoso
turning
around
we
have
decided
in
accordance
with
our
conscience
to
take
the
money

accursed

there
he
bends
down
and
draws
a
map
on
the
floor
with
his
crooked
finger
all
bend
down
and
look
attentively
only
the
abbot
gazes
sternly
out
of
the
window
behind
which
the
heavy
fog
is
still
grey
haggart
whispers
in
a
fit
of
rage
mariet
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
killed
me
as
i
killed
philipp
and
now
my
father
is
calling
me
where
will
be
the
end

and

chapter
vii
these
are
your
comrades
haggart
i
am
so
glad
to
see
them
you
said
gart
yes
you
said
that
their
faces
were
entirely
different
from
the
faces
of
our
people
and
that
is
true
oh
how
true
it
is
our
people
have
handsome
faces
too
don
t
think
our
fishermen
are
ugly
but
they
haven
t
these
deep
terrible
sears
i
like
them
very
much
i
assure
you
gart
i
suppose
you
are
a
friend
of
haggart
s
you
have
such
stern
fine
eyes
but
you
are
silent
why
are
they
silent
haggart
did
you
forbid
them
to
speak
and
why
are
you
silent
yourself
haggart
haggart
illuminated
by
the
light
of
torches
haggart
stands
and
listens
to
the
rapid
agitated
speech
the
metal
of
the
guns
and
the
uniforms
vibrates
and
flashes
the
light
is
also
playing
on
the
faces
of
those
who
have
surrounded
haggart
in
a
close
circle
these
are
his
nearest
his
friends
and
in
the
distance
there
is
a
different
game
there
a
large
ship
is
dancing
silently
casting
its
light
upon
the
black
waves
and
the
black
water
plays
with
them
pleating
them
like
a
braid
extinguishing
them
and
kindling
them
again
a
noisy
conversation
and
the
splashing
of
the
waters
and
the
dreadful
silence
of
kindred
human
lips
that
are
sealed
i
am
listening
to
you
mariet
says
haggart
at
last
what
do
you
want
mariet
it
is
impossible
that
some
one
should
have
offended
you
i
ordered
them
not
to
touch
your
oh
no

of
that
which
you
do
not

the

a
spell
over
me
and
turning
my
head
do
you
hear
the
noise
and
something
like
voices
that
is
the
sea
waiting
for
me
don
t
hold
my
soul
let
it
go
don
t
speak
haggart
i
know
everything

was
not
as
though
i
came
along
a
fiery
road
it
was
not
as
though
i
saw
blood
be
silent
haggart
i
have
seen
something
more
terrible
haggart
oh
if
you
could
only
understand
me
i
have
seen
cowardly
people
who
ran
without
defending
themselves
i
have
seen
clutching
greedy
fingers
crooked
like
those
of
birds
like
those
of
birds
haggart
and
out
of
these
fingers
which
were
forced
open
gold
was
taken
and
suddenly
i
saw
a
man
sobbing
think
of
it
haggart
they
were
taking
gold
from
him
and
he
was
she
laughs
bitterly
haggart
advances
a
step
toward
her
and
puts
his
heavy
hand
upon
her
shoulder
yes
yes
mariet
speak
on
girl
let
the
sea
mariet
removes
his
hand
and
continues
no
i
thought
these
are
not
my
brethren
at
all
i
thought
and
laughed
and
father
shouted
to
the
cowards
take
shafts
and
strike
but
they
were
running
father
is
such
a
splendid
father
is
a
splendid
man
haggart
affirms
cheerfully
such
a
splendid
man
and
then
one
sailor
bent
down
close
to
noni
perhaps
he
did
not
want
to
do
any
harm
to
him
but
he
bent
down
to
him
too
closely
so
i
fired
at
him
from
your
pistol
is
it
nothing
that
i
fired
at
our
sailor
haggart
laughs
he
had
a
comical
face
you
killed
him
no
i
don
t
know
how
to
shoot
and
it
was
he
who
told
me
where
you
were
o
haggart
o
brother
she
sobs
and
then
she
speaks
angrily
with
a
shade
of
a
serpentine
hiss
in
her
voice
i
hate
them
they
were
not
tortured
enough
i
would
have
tortured
them
still
more
still
more
oh
what
cowardly
rascals
they
are
listen
haggart
i
was
always
afraid
of
your
power
to
me
there
was
always
something
terrible
and
incomprehensible
in
your
power
where
is
his
god
i
wondered
and
i
was
terrified
even
this
morning
i
was
afraid
but
now
that
this
night
came
this
terror
has
fled
and
i
came
running
to
you
over
the
fiery
road

am
going
with
you

cannon
ball

love
to
watch
its
invisible
flight

one
comes
in
its
way
let
him
fate
itself
strikes
down
like
that
what
is
an
aim

monstrous
dreams
terrified
his
heavy
frame
trembling
helplessly
pushing
the
people
aside

glitter
of
the
metal
the
dark
and
terrible
faces

hears
the
angry
splashing
of
the
waters
and
he
covers
his
head
with
his
hands
and
walks
off
quickly

khorre
jumps
up
and
strikes
him
with
a
knife
in

quivering
glitter
of

mysterious
merry
dashing
of
the
waves

fit
of
terror

frightened

happy

he
laughs
like
a
madman
and
the
sailors
respond
with
roaring
laughter
the
reflected
lights

dancing
more
merrily
upon
the
waves

a

reigns
a
woman
s
strange
voice
drowns
the
noise
so
strange
and
unfamiliar
as

ocean
and
a
distant
voice
sad
and
grave
replies
oh
haggart
my
dear
but
who
knows
perhaps
it
was
the
roaring
of
the
waves
many
sad
and
strange
dreams
come
to
man
on
earth
all
aboard
exclaims
haggart
cheerily
and
goes
off
without
looking
around
below
a
gay
noise
of
voices
and
laughter
resounds
the
cobblestones
are
rattling
under
the
firm
footsteps
haggart
is
going
away
haggart
he
goes
without
turning
around
haggart
he
has
gone
away
loud
shouting
is
heard
the
sailors
are
greeting
haggart
they
drink
and
go
off
into
the
darkness
on
the
shore
the
torches
which
were
cast
aside
are
burning
low
illumining
the
body
and
a
woman
is
rushing
about
she
runs
swiftly
from
one
spot
to
another
bending
down
over
the
steep
rocks
insane
dan
comes
crawling
out
is
that
you

high
on
a
mast
my
little
the
thundering
salute
drowns
her
cry
haggart
has
boarded
his
ship
the
night
grows
darker
and
the
dashing
of
the
waves
fainter
the
ocean
is
moving
away
with
the
tide
the
great
desert
of
the
sky
is
mute
and
the
night
grows
darker
and
the
dashing
of
the
waves
ever
fainter
judas
iscariot
and
others
chapter
i
jesus
christ
had
often
been
warned
that
judas
iscariot
was
a
man
of
very
evil
repute
and
that
he
ought
to
beware
of
him
some
of
the
disciples
who
had
been
in
judaea
knew
him
well
while
others
had
heard
much
about
him
from
various
sources
and
there
was
none
who
had
a
good
word
for
him
if
good
people
in
speaking
of
him
blamed
him
as
covetous
cunning
and
inclined
to
hypocrisy
and
lying
the
bad
when
asked
concerning
him
inveighed
against
him
in
the
severest
terms
he
is
always
making
mischief
among
us
they
would
say
and
spit
in
contempt
he
always
has
some
thought
which
he
keeps
to
himself
he
creeps
into
a
house
quietly
like
a
scorpion
but
goes
out
again
with
an
ostentatious
noise
there
are
friends
among
thieves
and
comrades
among
robbers
and
even
liars
have
wives
to
whom
they
speak
the
truth
but
judas
laughs
at
thieves
and
honest
folk
alike
although
he
is
himself
a
clever
thief
moreover
he
is
in
appearance
the
ugliest
person
in
judaea
no
he
is
no
friend
of
ours
this
judas
iscariot
the
bad
would
say
thereby
surprising
the
good
people
in
whose
opinion
there
was
not
much
difference
between
him
and
all
other
vicious
people
in
judaea
they
would
recount
further
that
he
had
long
ago
deserted
his
wife
who
was
living
in
poverty
and
misery
striving
to
eke
out
a
living
from
the
unfruitful
patch
of
land
which
constituted
his
estate
he
had
wandered
for
many
years
aimlessly
among
the
people
and
had
even
gone
from
one
sea
to
the
other
no
mean
distance
and
everywhere
he
lied
and
grimaced
and
would
make
some
discovery
with
his
thievish
eye
and
then
suddenly
disappear
leaving
behind
him
animosity
and
strife
yes
he
was
as
inquisitive
artful
and
hateful
as
a
demon
children
he
had
none
and
this
was
an
additional
proof
that
judas
was
a
wicked
man
that
god
would
not
have
from
him
any
posterity
none
of
the
disciples
had
noticed
when
it
was
that
this
ugly
jew
first
appeared
in
the
company
of
christ
but
he
had
for
a
long
time
haunted
their
path
joined
in
their
conversations
performed
little
acts
of
service
bowing
and
smiling
and
currying
favour
sometimes
they
became
quite
used
to
him
so
that
he
escaped
their
weary
eyes
then
again
he
would
suddenly
obtrude
himself
on
eye
and
ear
irritating
them
as
something
abnormally
ugly
treacherous
and
disgusting
they
would
drive
him
away
with
harsh
words
and
for
a
short
time
he
would
disappear
only
to
reappear
suddenly
officious
flattering
and
crafty
as
a
demon
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
disciples
that
under
his
desire
to
draw
near
to
jesus
was
hidden
some
secret
intention
some
malign
and
cunning
scheme
but
jesus
did
not
listen
to
their
advice
their
prophetic
voice
did
not
reach
his
ears
in
that
spirit
of
serene
contradiction
which
ever
irresistibly
inclined
him
to
the
reprobate
and
unlovable
he
deliberately
accepted
judas
and
included
him
in
the
circle
of
the
chosen
the
disciples
were
disturbed
and
murmured
under
their
breath
but
he
would
sit
still
with
his
face
towards
the
setting
sun
and
listen
abstractedly
perhaps
to
them
perhaps
to
something
else
for
ten
days
there
had
been
no
wind
and
the
transparent
atmosphere
wary
and
sensitive
continued
ever
the
same
motionless
and
unchanged
it
seemed
as
though
it
preserved
in
its
transparent
depths
every
cry
and
song
made
during
those
days
by
men
and
beasts
and
birds
tears
laments
and
cheerful
song
prayers
and
curses
and
that
on
account
of
these
crystallised
sounds
the
air
was
so
heavy
threatening
and
saturated
with
invisible
life
once
more
the
sun
was
sinking
it
rolled
heavily
downwards
in
a
flaming
ball
setting
the
sky
on
fire
everything
upon
the
earth
which
was
turned
towards
it
the
swarthy
face
of
jesus
the
walls
of
the
houses
and
the
leaves
of
the
trees
everything
obediently
reflected
that
distant
fearfully
pensive
light
now
the
white
walls
were
no
longer
white
and
the
white
city
upon
the
white
hill
was
turned
to
red
and
lo
judas
arrived
he
arrived
bowing
low
bending
his
back
cautiously
and
timidly
protruding
his
ugly
bumpy
head
just
exactly
as
his
acquaintances
had
described
he
was
spare
and
of
good
height
almost
the
same
as
that
of
jesus
who
stooped
a
little
through
the
habit
of
thinking
as
he
walked
and
so
appeared
shorter
than
he
was
judas
was
to
all
appearances
fairly
strong
and
well
knit
though
for
some
reason
or
other
he
pretended
to
be
weak
and
somewhat
sickly
he
had
an
uncertain
voice
sometimes
it
was
strong
and
manly
then
again
shrill
as
that
of
an
old
woman
scolding
her
husband
provokingly
thin
and
disagreeable
to
the
ear
so
that
ofttimes
one
felt
inclined
to
tear
out
his
words
from
the
ear
like
rough
decaying
splinters
his
short
red
locks
failed
to
hide
the
curious
form
of
his
skull
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
split
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
by
a
double
and
then
joined
together
again
so
that
it
was
apparently
divided
into
four
parts
and
inspired
distrust
nay
even
alarm
for
behind
such
a
cranium
there
could
be
no
quiet
or
concord
but
there
must
ever
be
heard
the
noise
of
sanguinary
and
merciless
strife
the
face
of
judas
was
similarly
doubled
one
side
of
it
with
a
black
sharply
watchful
eye
was
vivid
and
mobile
readily
gathering
into
innumerable
tortuous
wrinkles
on
the
other
side
were
no
wrinkles
it
was
deadly
flat
smooth
and
set
and
though
of
the
same
size
as
the
other
it
seemed
enormous
on
account
of
its
blind
eye
covered
with
a
whitish
film
closing
neither
night
nor
day
this
eye
met
light
and
darkness
with
the
same
indifference
but
perhaps
on
account
of
the
proximity
of
its
lively
and
crafty
companion
it
never
got
full
credit
for
blindness
when
in
a
paroxysm
of
joy
or
excitement
judas
would
close
his
sound
eye
and
shake
his
head
the
other
eye
would
always
shake
in
unison
and
gaze
in
silence
even
people
quite
devoid
of
penetration
could
clearly
perceive
when
looking
at
judas
that
such
a
man
could
bring
no
good
and
yet
jesus
brought
him
near
to
himself
and
once
even
made
him
sit
next
to
him
john
the
beloved
disciple
fastidiously
moved
away
and
all
the
others
who
loved
their
teacher
cast
down
their
eyes
in
disapprobation
but
judas
sat
on
and
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
began
in
a
somewhat
thin
voice
to
complain
of
and
said
that
his
chest
gave
him
pain
in
the
night
and
that
when
ascending
a
hill
he
got
out
of
breath
and
when
he
stood
still
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
he
would
be
seized
with
a
dizziness
and
could
scarcely
restrain
a
foolish
desire
to
throw
himself
down
and
many
other
impious
things
he
invented
as
though
not
understanding
that
sicknesses
do
not
come
to
a
man
by
chance
but
as
a
consequence
of
conduct
not
corresponding
with
the
laws
of
the
eternal
thus
judas
iscariot
kept
on
rubbing
his
chest
with
his
broad
palm
and
even
pretended
to
cough
midst
a
general
silence
and
downcast
eyes
john
without
looking
at
the
teacher
whispered
to
his
friend
simon
peter
aren
t
you
tired
of
that
lie
i
can
t
stand
it
any
longer
i
am
going
peter
glanced
at
jesus
and
meeting
his
eye
quickly
arose
wait
a
moment
said
he
to
his
friend
once
more
he
looked
at
jesus
sharply
as
a
stone
torn
from
a
mountain
he
moved
towards
judas
and
said
to
him
in
a
loud
voice
with
expansive
serene
courtesy
you
will
come
with
us
he
gave
him
a
kindly
slap
on
his
bent
back
and
without
looking
at
the
teacher
though
he
felt
his
eye
upon
him
resolutely
added
in
his
loud
voice
which
excluded
all
objection
just
as
water
excludes
air
it
does
not
matter
that
you
have
such
a
nasty
face
there
fall
into
our
nets
even
worse
monstrosities
and
they
sometimes
turn
out
very
tasty
food
it
is
not
for
us
our
lord
s
fishermen
to
throw
away
a
catch
merely
because
the
fish
have
spines
or
only
one
eye
i
saw
once
at
tyre
an
octopus
which
had
been
caught
by
the
local
fishermen
and
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
wanted
to
run
away
but
they
laughed
at
me
a
fisherman
from
tiberias
gave
me
some
of
it
to
eat
and
i
asked
for
more
it
was
so
tasty
you
remember
master
that
i
told
you
the
story
and
you
laughed
too
and
you
judas
are
like
an
octopus
but
only
on
one
and
he
laughed
loudly
content
with
his
joke
when
peter
spoke
his
words
resounded
so
forcibly
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
driving
them
in
with
nails
when
peter
moved
or
did
anything
he
made
a
noise
that
could
be
heard
afar
and
which
called
forth
a
response
from
the
deafest
of
things
the
stone
floor
rumbled
under
his
feet
the
doors
shook
and
rattled
and
the
very
air
was
convulsed
with
fear
and
roared
in
the
clefts
of
the
mountains
his
voice
awoke
the
inmost
echo
and
in
the
when
they
were
fishing
on
the
lake
he
would
roll
about
on
the
sleepy
glittering
water
and
force
the
first
shy
sunbeams
into
smiles
for
this
apparently
he
was
loved
when
on
all
other
faces
there
still
lay
the
shadow
of
night
his
powerful
head
and
bare
breast
and
freely
extended
arms
were
already
aglow
with
the
light
of
dawn
the
words
of
peter
evidently
approved
as
they
were
by
the
master
dispersed
the
oppressive
atmosphere
but
some
of
the
disciples
who
had
been
to
the
seaside
and
had
seen
an
octopus
were
disturbed
by
the
monstrous
image
so
lightly
applied
to
the
new
disciple
they
recalled
the
immense
eyes
the
dozens
of
greedy
tentacles
the
feigned
repose
and
how
all
at
once
it
embraced
clung
crushed
and
sucked
all
without
one
wink
of
its
monstrous
eyes
what
did
it
mean
but
jesus
remained
silent
he
smiled
with
a
frown
of
kindly
raillery
on
peter
who
was
still
telling
glowing
tales
about
the
octopus
then
one
by
one
the
disciples
approached
judas
and
began
a
friendly
conversation
with
him
but
beat
a
hasty
and
awkward
retreat
only
john
the
son
of
zebedee
maintained
an
obstinate
silence
and
thomas
had
evidently
not
made
up
his
mind
to
say
anything
but
was
still
weighing
the
matter
he
kept
his
gaze
attentively
fixed
on
christ
and
judas
as
they
sat
together
and
that
strange
proximity
of
divine
beauty
and
monstrous
ugliness
of
a
man
with
a
benign
look
and
of
an
octopus
with
immense
motionless
dully
greedy
eyes
oppressed
his
mind
like
an
insoluble
enigma
he
tensely
wrinkled
his
smooth
upright
forehead
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
thinking
that
he
would
see
better
so
but
only
succeeded
in
imagining
that
judas
really
had
eight
incessantly
moving
feet
but
that
was
not
true
thomas
understood
that
and
again
gazed
obstinately
judas
gathered
courage
he
straightened
out
his
arms
which
had
been
bent
at
the
elbows
relaxed
the
muscles
which
held
his
jaws
in
tension
and
began
cautiously
to
protrude
his
bumpy
head
into
the
light
it
had
been
the
whole
time
in
view
of
all
but
judas
imagined
that
it
had
been
impenetrably
hidden
from
sight
by
some
invisible
but
thick
and
cunning
veil
but
lo
now
as
though
creeping
out
from
a
ditch
he
felt
his
strange
skull
and
then
his
eyes
in
the
light
he
stopped
and
then
deliberately
exposed
his
whole
face
nothing
happened
peter
had
gone
away
somewhere
or
other
jesus
sat
pensive
with
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
and
gently
swayed
his
sunburnt
foot
the
disciples
were
conversing
together
and
only
thomas
gazed
at
him
attentively
and
seriously
like
a
conscientious
tailor
taking
measurement
judas
smiled
thomas
did
not
reply
to
the
smile
but
evidently
took
it
into
account
as
he
did
everything
else
and
continued
to
gaze
but
something
unpleasant
alarmed
the
left
side
of
judas
countenance
as
he
looked
round
john
handsome
pure
without
a
single
fleck
upon
his
conscience
was
looking
at
him
out
of
a
dark
corner
with
cold
but
beautiful
eyes
and
though
he
walked
as
others
walk
yet
judas
felt
as
if
he
were
dragging
himself
along
the
ground
like
a
whipped
cur
as
he
went
up
to
john
and
said
why
are
you
silent
john
your
words
are
like
golden
apples
in
vessels
of
silver
filigree
bestow
one
of
them
on
judas
who
is
so
john
looked
steadfastly
into
his
motionless
eye
and
said
nothing
and
he
looked
on
while
judas
crept
out
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
disappeared
in
the
deep
darkness
of
the
open
door
since
the
full
moon
was
up
there
were
many
people
out
walking
jesus
went
out
too
and
from
the
low
roof
on
which
judas
had
spread
his
couch
he
saw
him
going
out
in
the
light
of
the
moon
each
white
figure
looked
bright
and
deliberate
in
its
movements
and
seemed
not
so
much
to
walk
as
to
glide
in
front
of
its
dark
shadow
then
suddenly
a
man
would
be
lost
in
something
black
and
his
voice
became
audible
and
when
people
reappeared
in
the
moonlight
they
seemed
silent
like
white
walls
or
black
shadows
as
everything
did
in
the
transparent
mist
of
night
almost
every
one
was
asleep
when
judas
heard
the
soft
voice
of
jesus
returning
all
in
and
around
about
the
house
was
still
a
cock
crew
somewhere
an
ass
disturbed
in
his
sleep
brayed
aloud
and
insolently
as
in
daytime
then
reluctantly
and
gradually
relapsed
into
silence
judas
did
not
sleep
at
all
but
listened
surreptitiously
the
moon
illumined
one
half
of
his
face
and
was
reflected
strangely
in
his
enormous
open
eye
as
on
the
frozen
surface
of
a
lake
suddenly
he
remembered
something
and
hastily
coughed
rubbing
his
perfectly
healthy
chest
with
his
hairy
hand
maybe
some
one
was
not
yet
asleep
and
was
listening
to
what
judas
was
thinking
chapter
ii
they
gradually
became
used
to
judas
and
ceased
to
notice
his
ugliness
jesus
entrusted
the
common
purse
to
him
and
with
it
there
fell
on
him
all
household
cares
he
purchased
the
necessary
food
and
clothing
distributed
alms
and
when
they
were
on
the
road
it
was
his
duty
to
choose
the
place
where
they
were
to
stop
or
to
find
a
night
s
lodging
all
this
he
did
very
cleverly
so
that
in
a
short
time
he
had
earned
the
goodwill
of
some
of
the
disciples
who
had
noticed
his
efforts
judas
was
an
habitual
liar
but
they
became
used
to
this
when
they
found
that
his
lies
were
not
followed
by
any
evil
conduct
nay
they
added
a
special
piquancy
to
his
conversation
and
tales
and
made
life
seem
like
a
comic
and
sometimes
a
tragic
tale
according
to
his
stories
he
seemed
to
know
every
one
and
each
person
that
he
knew
had
some
time
in
his
life
been
guilty
of
evil
conduct
or
even
crime
those
according
to
him
were
called
good
who
knew
how
to
conceal
their
thoughts
and
acts
but
if
one
only
embraced
flattered
and
questioned
such
a
man
sufficiently
there
would
ooze
out
from
him
every
untruth
nastiness
and
lie
like
matter
from
a
pricked
wound
he
freely
confessed
that
he
sometimes
lied
himself
but
affirmed
with
an
oath
that
others
were
still
greater
liars
and
that
if
any
one
in
this
world
was
ever
deceived
it
was
judas
indeed
according
to
his
own
account
he
had
been
deceived
time
upon
time
in
one
way
or
another
thus
a
certain
guardian
of
the
treasures
of
a
rich
grandee
once
confessed
to
him
that
he
had
for
ten
years
been
continually
on
the
point
of
stealing
the
property
committed
to
him
but
that
he
was
debarred
by
fear
of
the
grandee
and
of
his
own
conscience
and
judas
believed
him
and
he
suddenly
committed
the
theft
and
deceived
judas
but
even
then
judas
still
trusted
him
and
then
he
suddenly
restored
the
stolen
treasure
to
the
grandee
and
again
deceived
judas
yes
everything
deceived
him
even
animals
whenever
he
pets
a
dog
it
bites
his
fingers
but
when
he
beats
it
with
a
stick
it
licks
his
feet
and
looks
into
his
eyes
like
a
daughter
he
killed
one
such
dog
and
buried
it
deep
laying
a
great
stone
on
the
top
of
it
but
who
knows
perhaps
just
because
he
killed
it
it
has
come
to
life
again
and
instead
of
lying
in
the
trench
is
running
about
cheerfully
with
other
dogs
all
laughed
merrily
at
judas
tale
and
he
smiled
pleasantly
himself
winking
his
one
lively
mocking
eye
and
by
that
very
smile
confessed
that
he
had
lied
somewhat
that
he
had
not
really
killed
the
dog
but
he
meant
to
find
it
and
kill
it
because
he
did
not
wish
to
be
deceived
and
at
these
words
of
judas
they
laughed
all
the
more
but
sometimes
in
his
tales
he
transgressed
the
bounds
of
probability
and
ascribed
to
people
such
proclivities
as
even
the
beasts
do
not
possess
accusing
them
of
such
crimes
as
are
not
and
never
have
been
and
since
he
named
in
this
connection
the
most
honoured
people
some
were
indignant
at
the
calumny
while
others
jokingly
asked
how
about
your
own
father
and
mother
judas
were
they
not
good
people
judas
winked
his
eye
and
smiled
with
a
gesture
of
his
hands
and
the
fixed
eye
shook
in
unison
with
the
shaking
of
his
head
and
looked
out
in
silence
but
who
was
my
father
perhaps
it
was
the
man
who
used
to
beat
me
with
a
rod
or
may
be
a
devil
a
goat
or
a
cock
how
can
judas
tell
how
can
judas
tell
with
whom
his
mother
shared
her
couch
judas
had
many
fathers
to
which
of
them
do
you
refer
but
at
this
they
were
all
indignant
for
they
had
a
profound
reverence
for
parents
and
matthew
who
was
very
learned
in
the
scriptures
said
severely
in
the
words
of
solomon
whoso
slandereth
his
father
and
his
mother
his
lamp
shall
be
extinguished
in
deep
but
john
the
son
of
zebedee
haughtily
jerked
out
and
what
of
us
what
evil
have
you
to
say
of
us
judas
iscariot
but
he
waved
his
hands
in
simulated
terror
whined
and
bowed
like
a
beggar
who
has
in
vain
asked
an
alms
of
a
ah
they
are
tempting
poor
judas
they
are
laughing
at
him
they
wish
to
take
in
the
poor
trusting
judas
and
while
one
side
of
his
face
was
crinkled
up
in
buffooning
grimaces
the
other
side
wagged
sternly
and
severely
and
the
eye
looked
out
in
a
broad
stare
more
and
louder
than
any
laughed
simon
peter
at
the
jokes
of
judas
iscariot
but
once
it
happened
that
he
suddenly
frowned
and
became
silent
and
sad
and
hastily
dragging
judas
aside
by
the
sleeve
he
bent
down
and
asked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
but
jesus
what
do
you
think
of
jesus
speak
seriously
i
entreat
judas
cast
on
him
a
malign
glance
and
what
do
you
think
peter
whispered
with
awe
and
gladness
i
think
that
he
is
the
son
of
the
living
then
why
do
you
ask
what
can
judas
tell
you
whose
father
was
a
goat
but
do
you
love
him
you
do
not
seem
to
love
any
one
and
with
the
same
strange
malignity
iscariot
blurted
out
abruptly
and
sharply
i
some
two
days
after
this
conversation
peter
openly
dubbed
judas
my
friend
the
octopus
but
judas
awkwardly
and
ever
with
the
same
malignity
endeavoured
to
creep
away
from
him
into
some
dark
corner
and
would
sit
there
morosely
glaring
with
his
white
eye
thomas
alone
took
him
quite
seriously
he
understood
nothing
of
jokes
hypocrisy
or
lies
nor
of
the
play
upon
words
and
thoughts
but
investigated
everything
positively
to
the
very
bottom
he
would
often
interrupt
judas
stories
about
wicked
people
and
their
conduct
with
short
practical
remarks
you
must
prove
that
did
you
hear
it
yourself
was
there
any
one
present
besides
yourself
what
was
his
name
at
this
judas
would
get
angry
and
shrilly
cry
out
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
everything
himself
but
the
obstinate
thomas
would
go
on
quietly
and
persistently
until
judas
confessed
that
he
had
lied
or
until
he
invented
some
new
and
more
probable
lie
which
provided
the
others
for
some
time
with
food
for
thought
but
when
thomas
discovered
a
discrepancy
he
would
immediately
come
and
calmly
expose
the
liar
usually
judas
excited
in
him
a
strong
curiosity
which
brought
about
between
them
a
sort
of
friendship
full
of
wrangling
jeering
and
invective
on
the
one
side
and
of
quiet
insistence
on
the
other
sometimes
judas
felt
an
unbearable
aversion
to
his
strange
friend
and
transfixing
him
with
a
sharp
glance
would
say
irritably
and
almost
with
entreaty
what
more
do
you
want
i
have
told
you
i
want
you
to
prove
how
it
is
possible
that
a
should
be
your
father
thomas
would
reply
with
calm
insistency
and
wait
for
an
answer
it
chanced
once
that
after
such
a
question
judas
suddenly
stopped
speaking
and
gazed
at
him
with
surprise
from
head
to
foot
what
he
saw
was
a
tall
upright
figure
a
grey
face
honest
eyes
of
transparent
blue
two
fat
folds
beginning
at
the
nose
and
losing
themselves
in
a
stiff
beard
he
said
with
conviction
what
a
stupid
you
are
thomas
what
do
you
dream
about
a
tree
a
wall
or
a
donkey
thomas
was
in
some
way
strangely
perturbed
and
made
no
reply
but
at
night
when
judas
was
already
closing
his
vivid
restless
eye
for
sleep
he
suddenly
said
aloud
from
where
he
lay
the
two
now
slept
together
on
the
roof
you
are
wrong
judas
i
have
very
bad
dreams
what
think
you
are
people
responsible
for
their
dreams
does
then
any
one
but
the
dreamer
see
a
dream
judas
replied
thomas
sighed
gently
and
became
thoughtful
but
judas
smiled
contemptuously
and
firmly
closed
his
roguish
eye
and
quickly
gave
himself
up
to
his
mutinous
dreams
monstrous
ravings
mad
phantoms
which
rent
his
bumpy
skull
to
pieces
when
during
jesus
travels
about
judaea
the
disciples
approached
a
village
iscariot
would
speak
evil
of
the
inhabitants
and
foretell
misfortune
but
almost
always
it
happened
that
the
people
of
whom
he
had
spoken
evil
met
christ
and
his
friends
with
gladness
and
surrounded
them
with
attentions
and
love
and
became
believers
and
judas
became
so
full
that
it
was
difficult
to
carry
and
when
they
laughed
at
his
mistake
he
would
make
a
humble
gesture
with
his
hands
and
say
well
well
judas
thought
that
they
were
bad
and
they
turned
out
to
be
good
they
quickly
believed
and
gave
money
that
only
means
that
judas
has
been
deceived
once
more
the
poor
confiding
judas
iscariot
but
on
one
occasion
when
they
had
already
gone
far
from
a
village
which
had
welcomed
them
kindly
thomas
and
judas
began
a
hot
dispute
to
settle
which
they
turned
back
and
did
not
overtake
jesus
and
his
disciples
until
the
next
day
thomas
wore
a
perturbed
and
sorrowful
appearance
while
judas
had
such
a
proud
look
that
you
would
have
thought
that
he
expected
them
to
offer
him
their
congratulations
and
thanks
upon
the
spot
approaching
the
master
thomas
declared
with
decision
judas
was
right
lord
they
were
stupid
people
and
the
seeds
of
your
words
has
fallen
upon
the
and
he
related
what
had
happened
in
the
village
after
jesus
and
his
disciples
left
it
an
old
woman
had
begun
to
cry
out
that
her
little
white
kid
had
been
stolen
and
she
laid
the
theft
at
the
door
of
the
visitors
who
had
just
departed
at
first
the
people
had
disputed
with
her
but
when
she
obstinately
insisted
that
there
was
no
one
else
who
could
have
done
it
except
jesus
many
agreed
with
her
and
even
were
about
to
start
in
pursuit
and
although
they
soon
found
the
kid
straying
in
the
underwood
they
still
decided
that
jesus
was
a
deceiver
and
possibly
a
thief
so
that
s
what
they
think
of
us
is
it
cried
peter
with
a
snort
lord
wilt
thou
that
i
return
to
those
fools
and
but
jesus
saying
not
a
word
gazed
severely
at
him
and
peter
in
silence
retired
behind
the
others
and
no
one
ever
referred
to
the
incident
again
as
though
it
had
never
occurred
and
as
though
judas
had
been
proved
wrong
in
vain
did
he
show
himself
on
all
sides
endeavouring
to
give
to
his
double
crafty
hooknosed
face
an
expression
of
modesty
they
would
not
look
at
him
and
if
by
chance
any
one
did
glance
at
him
it
was
in
a
very
unfriendly
not
to
say
contemptuous
manner
from
that
day
on
jesus
treatment
of
him
underwent
a
strange
change
formerly
for
some
reason
or
other
judas
never
used
to
speak
directly
with
jesus
who
never
addressed
himself
directly
to
him
but
nevertheless
would
often
glance
at
him
with
kindly
eyes
smile
at
his
rallies
and
if
he
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
would
inquire
where
is
judas
but
now
he
looked
at
him
as
if
he
did
not
see
him
although
as
before
and
indeed
more
determinedly
than
formerly
he
sought
him
out
with
his
eyes
every
time
that
he
began
to
speak
to
the
disciples
or
to
the
people
but
he
was
either
sitting
with
his
back
to
him
so
that
he
was
obliged
as
it
were
to
cast
his
words
over
his
head
so
as
to
reach
judas
or
else
he
made
as
though
he
did
not
notice
him
at
all
and
whatever
he
said
though
it
was
one
thing
one
day
and
then
next
day
quite
another
although
it
might
be
the
very
thing
that
judas
was
thinking
it
always
seemed
as
though
he
were
speaking
against
him
to
all
he
was
the
tender
beautiful
flower
the
rose
of
lebanon
but
for
judas
he
left
only
sharp
thorns
as
though
judas
had
neither
heart
nor
sight
nor
smell
and
did
not
understand
even
better
than
any
the
beauty
of
tender
immaculate
petals
thomas
do
you
like
the
yellow
rose
of
lebanon
which
has
a
swarthy
countenance
and
eyes
like
the
roe
he
inquired
once
of
his
friend
who
replied
indifferently
rose
yes
i
like
the
smell
but
i
have
never
heard
of
a
rose
with
a
swarthy
countenance
and
eyes
like
a
roe
what
do
you
not
know
that
the
polydactylous
cactus
which
tore
your
new
garment
yesterday
has
only
one
beautiful
flower
and
only
one
eye
but
thomas
did
not
know
this
although
only
yesterday
a
cactus
had
actually
caught
in
his
garment
and
torn
it
into
wretched
rags
but
then
thomas
never
did
know
anything
though
he
asked
questions
about
everything
and
looked
so
straight
with
his
bright
transparent
eyes
through
which
as
through
a
pane
of
phoenician
glass
was
visible
a
wall
with
a
dismal
ass
tied
to
it
some
time
later
another
occurrence
took
place
in
which
judas
again
proved
to
be
in
the
right
at
a
certain
village
in
judaea
of
which
judas
had
so
bad
an
opinion
that
he
had
advised
them
to
avoid
it
the
people
received
christ
with
hostility
and
after
his
sermon
and
exposition
of
hypocrites
they
burst
into
fury
and
threatened
to
stone
jesus
and
his
disciples
enemies
he
had
many
and
most
likely
they
would
have
carried
out
their
sinister
intention
but
for
judas
iscariot
seized
with
a
mad
fear
for
jesus
as
though
he
already
saw
the
drops
of
ruby
blood
upon
his
white
garment
judas
threw
himself
in
blind
fury
upon
the
crowd
scolding
screeching
beseeching
and
lying
and
thus
gave
time
and
opportunity
to
jesus
and
his
disciples
to
escape
amazingly
active
as
though
running
upon
a
dozen
feet
laughable
and
terrible
in
his
fury
and
entreaties
he
threw
himself
madly
in
front
of
the
crowd
and
charmed
it
with
a
certain
strange
power
he
shouted
that
the
nazarene
was
not
possessed
of
a
devil
that
he
was
simply
an
impostor
a
thief
who
loved
money
as
did
all
his
disciples
and
even
judas
himself
and
he
rattled
the
grimaced
and
beseeched
throwing
himself
on
the
ground
and
by
degrees
the
anger
of
the
crowd
changed
into
laughter
and
disgust
and
they
let
fall
the
stones
which
they
had
picked
up
to
throw
at
them
they
are
not
fit
to
die
by
the
hands
of
an
honest
person
said
they
while
others
thoughtfully
followed
the
rapidly
disappearing
judas
with
their
eyes
again
judas
expected
to
receive
congratulations
praise
and
thanks
and
made
a
show
of
his
torn
garments
and
pretended
that
he
had
been
beaten
but
this
time
too
he
was
greatly
mistaken
the
angry
jesus
strode
on
in
silence
and
even
peter
and
john
did
not
venture
to
approach
him
and
all
whose
eyes
fell
on
judas
in
his
torn
garments
his
face
glowing
with
happiness
but
still
somewhat
frightened
repelled
him
with
curt
angry
exclamations
it
was
just
as
though
he
had
not
saved
them
all
just
as
though
he
had
not
saved
their
teacher
whom
they
loved
so
dearly
do
you
want
to
see
some
fools
said
he
to
thomas
who
was
thoughtfully
walking
in
the
rear
look
there
they
go
along
the
road
in
a
crowd
like
a
flock
of
sheep
kicking
up
the
dust
but
you
are
wise
thomas
you
creep
on
behind
and
i
the
noble
magnificent
judas
creep
on
behind
like
a
dirty
slave
who
has
no
place
by
the
side
of
his
why
do
you
call
yourself
magnificent
asked
thomas
in
surprise
because
i
am
so
judas
replied
with
conviction
and
he
went
on
talking
giving
more
details
of
how
he
had
deceived
the
enemies
of
jesus
and
laughed
at
them
and
their
stupid
stones
but
you
told
lies
said
thomas
of
course
i
did
quickly
assented
iscariot
i
gave
them
what
they
asked
for
and
they
gave
me
in
return
what
i
wanted
and
what
is
a
lie
my
clever
thomas
would
not
the
death
of
jesus
be
the
greatest
lie
of
all
you
did
not
act
rightly
now
i
believe
that
a
devil
is
your
father
it
was
he
that
taught
you
the
face
of
judas
grew
pale
and
something
suddenly
came
over
thomas
and
as
if
it
were
a
white
cloud
passed
over
and
concealed
the
road
and
jesus
with
a
gentle
movement
judas
just
as
suddenly
drew
thomas
to
himself
pressed
him
closely
with
a
paralysing
movement
and
whispered
in
his
ear
you
mean
then
that
a
devil
has
instructed
me
don
t
you
thomas
well
i
saved
jesus
therefore
a
devil
loves
jesus
and
has
need
of
him
and
of
the
truth
is
it
not
so
thomas
but
then
my
father
was
not
a
devil
but
a
can
a
want
jesus
eh
and
don
t
you
want
him
yourselves
and
the
truth
also
angry
and
slightly
frightened
thomas
freed
himself
with
difficulty
from
the
clinging
embrace
of
judas
and
began
to
stride
forward
quickly
but
he
soon
slackened
his
pace
as
he
endeavoured
to
understand
what
had
taken
place
but
judas
crept
on
gently
behind
and
gradually
came
to
a
standstill
and
lo
in
the
distance
the
pedestrians
became
blended
into
a
mass
so
that
it
was
impossible
any
longer
to
distinguish
which
among
those
little
figures
was
jesus
and
lo
the
little
thomas
too
changed
into
a
grey
spot
and
suddenly
all
disappeared
round
a
turn
in
the
road
looking
round
judas
went
down
from
the
road
and
with
immense
leaps
descended
into
the
depths
of
a
rocky
ravine
his
clothes
blew
out
with
the
speed
and
abruptness
of
his
course
and
his
hands
were
extended
upwards
as
though
he
would
fly
lo
now
he
crept
along
an
abrupt
declivity
and
suddenly
rolled
down
in
a
grey
ball
rubbing
off
his
skin
against
the
stones
then
he
jumped
up
and
angrily
threatened
the
mountain
with
his
fist
you
too
damn
you
suddenly
he
changed
his
quick
movements
into
a
comfortable
concentrated
dawdling
chose
a
place
by
a
big
stone
and
sat
down
without
hurry
he
turned
himself
as
if
seeking
a
comfortable
position
laid
his
hands
side
by
side
on
the
grey
stone
and
heavily
sank
his
head
upon
them
and
so
for
an
hour
or
two
he
sat
on
as
motionless
and
grey
as
the
grey
stone
itself
so
still
that
he
deceived
even
the
birds
the
walls
of
the
ravine
rose
before
him
and
behind
and
on
every
side
cutting
a
sharp
line
all
round
on
the
blue
sky
while
everywhere
immense
grey
stones
obtruded
from
the
ground
as
though
there
had
been
at
some
time
or
other
a
shower
here
and
as
though
its
heavy
drops
had
become
petrified
in
endless
split
upturned
skull
and
every
stone
in
it
was
like
a
petrified
thought
and
there
were
many
of
them
and
they
all
kept
thinking
heavily
boundlessly
stubbornly
a
scorpion
deceived
by
his
quietness
hobbled
past
on
its
tottering
legs
close
to
judas
he
threw
a
glance
at
it
and
without
lifting
his
head
from
the
stone
again
let
both
his
eyes
rest
fixedly
on
something
both
motionless
both
veiled
in
a
strange
whitish
turbidness
both
as
though
blind
and
yet
terribly
alert
and
lo
from
out
of
the
ground
the
stones
and
the
clefts
the
quiet
darkness
of
night
began
to
rise
enveloped
the
motionless
judas
and
crept
swiftly
up
towards
the
pallid
light
of
the
sky
night
was
coming
on
with
its
thoughts
and
dreams
that
night
judas
did
not
return
to
the
and
the
disciples
forgetting
their
thoughts
busied
themselves
with
preparations
for
their
meal
and
grumbled
at
his
negligence
chapter
iii
once
about
jesus
and
his
disciples
were
walking
along
a
stony
and
hilly
road
devoid
of
shade
and
since
they
had
been
more
than
five
hours
afoot
jesus
began
to
complain
of
weariness
the
disciples
stopped
and
peter
and
his
friend
john
spread
their
cloaks
and
those
of
the
other
disciples
on
the
ground
and
fastened
them
above
between
two
high
rocks
and
so
made
a
sort
of
tent
for
jesus
he
lay
down
in
the
tent
resting
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
while
they
amused
him
with
pleasant
conversation
and
jokes
but
seeing
that
even
talking
fatigued
him
and
being
themselves
but
little
affected
by
weariness
and
the
heat
they
went
some
distance
off
and
occupied
themselves
in
various
ways
one
sought
edible
roots
among
the
stones
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
and
when
he
had
found
them
brought
them
to
jesus
another
climbing
up
higher
and
higher
searched
musingly
for
the
limits
of
the
blue
distance
and
failing
climbed
up
higher
on
to
new
rocks
john
found
a
beautiful
little
blue
lizard
among
the
stones
and
smiling
brought
it
quickly
with
tender
hands
to
jesus
the
lizard
looked
with
its
protuberant
mysterious
eyes
into
his
and
then
crawled
quickly
with
its
cold
body
over
his
warm
hand
and
soon
swiftly
disappeared
with
tender
quivering
tail
but
peter
and
philip
not
caring
about
such
amusements
occupied
themselves
in
tearing
up
great
stones
from
the
mountain
and
hurling
them
down
below
as
a
test
of
their
strength
the
others
attracted
by
their
loud
laughter
by
degrees
gathered
round
them
and
joined
in
their
sport
exerting
their
strength
they
would
tear
up
from
the
ground
an
ancient
rock
all
overgrown
and
lifting
it
high
with
both
hands
hurl
it
down
the
slope
heavily
it
would
strike
with
a
dull
thud
and
hesitate
for
a
moment
then
resolutely
it
would
make
a
first
leap
and
each
time
it
touched
the
ground
gathering
from
it
speed
and
strength
it
would
become
light
furious
now
it
no
longer
leapt
but
flew
with
grinning
teeth
and
the
whistling
wind
let
its
dull
round
mass
pass
by
lo
it
is
on
the
edge
with
a
last
floating
motion
the
stone
would
sweep
high
and
then
quietly
with
ponderous
deliberation
fly
downwards
in
a
curve
to
the
invisible
bottom
of
the
precipice
now
then
another
cried
peter
his
white
teeth
shone
between
his
black
beard
and
moustache
his
mighty
chest
and
arms
were
bare
and
the
sullen
ancient
rocks
dully
wondering
at
the
strength
which
lifted
them
obediently
one
after
another
precipitated
themselves
into
the
abyss
even
the
frail
john
threw
some
stones
and
jesus
smiled
quietly
as
he
looked
at
their
sport
but
what
are
you
doing
judas
why
do
you
not
take
part
in
the
game
it
seems
amusing
enough
asked
thomas
when
he
found
his
strange
friend
motionless
behind
a
great
grey
stone
i
have
a
pain
in
my
chest
moreover
they
have
not
invited
what
need
of
invitation
at
all
events
i
invite
you
come
look
what
stones
peter
throws
judas
somehow
or
other
happened
to
glance
sideward
at
him
and
thomas
became
for
the
first
time
indistinctly
aware
that
he
had
two
faces
but
before
he
could
thoroughly
grasp
the
fact
judas
said
in
his
ordinary
tone
at
once
fawning
and
mocking
there
is
surely
none
stronger
than
peter
when
he
shouts
all
the
asses
in
jerusalem
think
that
their
messiah
has
arrived
and
lift
up
their
voices
too
you
have
heard
them
before
now
have
you
not
thomas
smiling
politely
and
modestly
wrapping
his
garment
round
his
chest
which
was
overgrown
with
red
curly
hairs
judas
stepped
into
the
circle
of
players
and
since
they
were
all
in
high
good
humour
they
met
him
with
mirth
and
loud
jokes
and
even
john
condescended
to
vouchsafe
a
smile
when
judas
pretending
to
groan
with
the
exertion
laid
hold
of
an
immense
stone
but
lo
he
lifted
it
with
ease
and
threw
it
and
his
blind
eye
gave
a
jerk
and
then
fixed
itself
immovably
on
peter
while
the
other
eye
cunning
and
merry
was
overflowing
with
quiet
laughter
no
you
throw
again
said
peter
in
an
offended
tone
and
lo
one
after
the
other
they
kept
lifting
and
throwing
gigantic
stones
while
the
disciples
looked
on
in
amazement
peter
threw
a
great
stone
and
then
judas
a
still
bigger
one
peter
frowning
and
concentrated
angrily
wielded
a
fragment
of
rock
and
struggling
as
he
lifted
it
hurled
it
down
then
judas
without
ceasing
to
smile
searched
for
a
still
larger
fragment
and
digging
his
long
fingers
into
it
grasped
it
and
swinging
himself
together
with
it
and
paling
sent
it
into
the
gulf
when
he
had
thrown
his
stone
peter
would
recoil
and
so
watch
its
fall
but
judas
always
bent
himself
forward
stretched
out
his
long
vibrant
arms
as
though
he
were
going
to
fly
after
the
stone
eventually
both
of
them
first
peter
then
judas
seized
hold
of
an
old
grey
stone
but
neither
one
nor
the
other
could
move
it
all
red
with
his
exertion
peter
resolutely
approached
jesus
and
said
aloud
lord
i
do
not
wish
to
be
beaten
by
judas
help
me
to
throw
this
jesus
made
answer
in
a
low
voice
and
peter
shrugging
his
broad
shoulders
in
dissatisfaction
but
not
daring
to
make
any
rejoinder
came
back
with
the
words
he
says
but
who
will
help
iscariot
then
glancing
at
judas
who
panting
with
clenched
teeth
was
still
embracing
the
stubborn
stone
he
laughed
cheerfully
look
what
an
invalid
he
is
see
what
our
poor
sick
judas
is
doing
and
even
judas
laughed
at
being
so
unexpectedly
exposed
in
his
deception
and
all
the
others
laughed
too
and
even
thomas
allowed
his
pointed
grey
overhanging
moustache
to
relax
into
a
smile
and
so
in
friendly
chat
and
laughter
they
all
set
out
again
on
the
way
and
peter
quite
reconciled
to
his
victor
kept
from
time
to
time
digging
him
in
the
ribs
and
loudly
guffawed
there
s
an
invalid
for
you
all
of
them
praised
judas
and
acknowledged
him
victor
and
all
chatted
with
him
in
a
friendly
manner
but
jesus
once
again
had
no
word
of
praise
for
judas
he
walked
silently
in
front
nibbling
the
grasses
which
he
plucked
and
gradually
one
by
one
the
disciples
craved
laughing
and
went
over
to
jesus
so
that
in
a
short
time
it
came
about
that
they
were
all
walking
ahead
in
a
compact
body
while
judas
the
victor
the
strong
man
crept
on
behind
choking
with
dust
and
lo
they
stood
still
and
jesus
laid
his
hand
on
peter
s
shoulder
while
with
his
other
he
pointed
into
the
distance
where
jerusalem
had
just
become
visible
in
the
smoke
and
the
broad
strong
back
of
peter
gently
accepted
that
slight
sunburnt
hand
for
the
night
they
stayed
in
bethany
at
the
house
of
lazarus
and
when
all
were
gathered
together
for
conversation
judas
thought
that
they
would
now
recall
his
victory
over
peter
and
sat
down
nearer
but
the
disciples
were
silent
and
unusually
pensive
images
of
the
road
they
had
traversed
of
the
sun
the
rocks
and
the
grass
of
christ
lying
down
under
the
shelter
quietly
floated
through
their
heads
breathing
a
soft
pensiveness
begetting
confused
but
sweet
reveries
of
an
eternal
movement
under
the
sun
the
wearied
body
reposed
sweetly
and
thought
was
merged
in
something
mystically
great
and
beautiful
and
no
one
recalled
judas
judas
went
out
and
then
returned
jesus
was
discoursing
and
his
disciples
were
listening
to
him
in
silence
mary
sat
at
his
feet
motionless
as
a
statue
and
gazed
into
his
face
with
upturned
eyes
john
had
come
quite
close
and
endeavoured
to
sit
so
that
his
hand
touched
the
garment
of
the
master
but
without
disturbing
him
he
touched
him
and
was
still
peter
breathed
loud
and
deeply
repeating
under
his
breath
the
words
of
jesus
iscariot
had
stopped
short
on
the
threshold
and
contemptuously
letting
his
gaze
pass
by
the
company
he
concentrated
all
its
fire
on
jesus
and
the
more
he
looked
the
more
everything
around
him
seemed
to
fade
and
to
become
clothed
with
darkness
and
silence
while
jesus
alone
shone
forth
with
uplifted
hand
and
then
lo
he
was
as
it
were
raised
up
into
the
air
and
melted
away
as
though
he
consisted
of
mist
floating
over
a
lake
and
penetrated
by
the
light
of
the
setting
moon
and
his
soft
speech
began
to
sound
tenderly
somewhere
far
far
away
and
gazing
at
the
wavering
phantom
and
drinking
in
the
tender
melody
of
the
distant
words
judas
gathered
his
whole
soul
into
his
iron
fingers
and
in
its
vast
darkness
silently
began
building
up
some
colossal
scheme
slowly
in
the
profound
darkness
he
kept
lifting
up
masses
like
mountains
and
quite
easily
heaping
them
one
on
another
and
again
he
would
lift
up
and
again
heap
them
up
and
something
grew
in
the
darkness
spread
noiselessly
and
burst
its
bounds
his
head
felt
like
a
dome
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
of
which
the
colossal
thing
continued
to
grow
and
some
one
working
on
in
silence
kept
lifting
up
masses
like
mountains
and
piling
them
one
on
another
and
again
lifting
up
and
so
on
and
on
whilst
somewhere
in
the
distance
the
words
tenderly
sounded
thus
he
stood
blocking
the
doorway
huge
and
black
while
jesus
went
on
talking
and
the
strong
intermittent
breathing
of
peter
repeated
his
words
aloud
but
on
a
sudden
jesus
broke
off
an
unfinished
sentence
and
peter
as
though
waking
from
sleep
cried
out
exultingly
lord
to
thee
are
known
the
words
of
eternal
life
but
jesus
held
his
peace
and
kept
gazing
fixedly
in
one
direction
and
when
they
followed
his
gaze
they
perceived
in
the
doorway
the
petrified
judas
with
gaping
mouth
and
fixed
eyes
and
not
understanding
what
was
the
matter
they
laughed
but
matthew
who
was
learned
in
the
scriptures
touched
judas
on
the
shoulder
and
said
in
the
words
of
solomon
he
that
looketh
kindly
shall
be
forgiven
but
he
that
is
met
within
the
gates
will
impede
judas
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
fretfully
and
everything
about
him
his
eyes
hands
and
feet
seemed
to
start
in
different
directions
as
those
of
an
animal
which
suddenly
perceives
the
eye
of
man
upon
him
jesus
went
straight
to
judas
as
though
words
trembled
on
his
lips
but
passed
by
him
through
the
open
and
now
unoccupied
door
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
restless
thomas
came
to
judas
bed
and
sitting
down
on
his
heels
asked
are
you
weeping
judas
no
go
away
why
do
you
groan
and
grind
your
teeth
are
you
ill
judas
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
fretfully
there
fell
from
his
lips
distressful
words
fraught
with
grief
and
anger
why
does
not
he
love
me
why
does
he
love
the
others
am
i
not
handsomer
better
and
stronger
than
they
did
not
i
save
his
life
while
they
ran
away
like
cowardly
dogs
my
poor
friend
you
are
not
quite
right
you
are
not
at
all
and
your
tongue
is
as
disagreeable
as
your
face
you
lie
and
slander
continually
how
then
can
you
expect
jesus
to
love
you
but
judas
stirring
heavily
in
the
darkness
continued
as
though
he
heard
him
not
why
is
he
not
on
the
side
of
judas
instead
of
on
the
side
of
those
who
do
not
love
him
john
brought
him
a
lizard
i
would
bring
him
a
poisonous
snake
peter
threw
stones
i
would
overthrow
a
mountain
for
his
sake
but
what
is
a
poisonous
snake
one
has
but
to
draw
its
fangs
and
it
will
coil
round
one
s
neck
like
a
necklace
what
is
a
mountain
which
it
is
possible
to
dig
down
with
the
hands
and
to
trample
with
the
feet
i
would
give
to
him
judas
the
bold
magnificent
judas
but
now
he
will
perish
and
together
with
him
will
perish
you
are
speaking
strangely
judas
a
withered
which
must
needs
be
cut
down
with
the
axe
such
am
i
he
said
it
of
me
why
then
does
he
not
do
it
he
dare
not
thomas
i
know
him
he
fears
judas
he
hides
from
the
bold
strong
magnificent
judas
he
loves
fools
traitors
liars
you
are
a
liar
thomas
have
you
never
been
told
so
before
thomas
was
much
surprised
and
wished
to
object
but
he
thought
that
judas
was
simply
railing
and
so
only
shook
his
head
in
the
darkness
and
judas
lamented
still
more
grievously
and
groaned
and
ground
his
teeth
and
his
whole
huge
body
could
be
heard
heaving
under
the
coverlet
what
is
the
matter
with
judas
who
has
applied
fire
to
his
body
he
will
give
his
son
to
the
dogs
he
will
give
his
daughter
to
be
betrayed
by
robbers
his
bride
to
harlotry
and
yet
has
not
judas
a
tender
heart
go
away
thomas
go
away
stupid
leave
the
strong
bold
magnificent
judas
alone
chapter
iv
judas
had
concealed
some
denarii
and
the
deception
was
discovered
thanks
to
thomas
who
had
seen
by
chance
how
much
money
had
been
given
to
them
it
was
only
too
probable
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
judas
had
committed
a
theft
and
they
all
were
enraged
the
angry
peter
seized
judas
by
his
collar
and
almost
dragged
him
to
jesus
and
the
terrified
judas
paled
but
did
not
resist
master
see
here
he
is
the
trickster
here
s
the
thief
you
trusted
him
and
he
steals
our
money
thief
scoundrel
if
thou
wilt
permit
i
ll
but
jesus
held
his
peace
and
attentively
regarding
him
peter
suddenly
turned
red
and
loosed
the
hand
which
held
the
collar
while
judas
shyly
rearranged
his
garment
casting
a
sidelong
glance
on
peter
and
assuming
the
downcast
look
of
a
repentant
criminal
so
that
s
how
it
s
to
be
angrily
said
peter
as
he
went
out
loudly
slamming
the
door
they
were
all
dissatisfied
and
declared
that
on
no
account
would
they
consort
with
judas
any
longer
but
john
after
some
consideration
passed
through
the
door
behind
which
might
be
heard
the
quiet
almost
caressing
voice
of
jesus
and
when
in
the
course
of
time
he
returned
he
was
pale
and
his
downcast
eyes
were
red
as
though
with
recent
tears
the
master
says
that
judas
may
take
as
much
money
as
he
peter
laughed
angrily
john
gave
him
a
quick
reproachful
glance
and
suddenly
flushing
and
mingling
tears
with
anger
and
delight
with
tears
loudly
exclaimed
and
no
one
must
reckon
how
much
money
judas
receives
he
is
our
brother
and
all
the
money
is
as
much
his
as
ours
if
he
wants
much
let
him
take
much
without
telling
any
one
or
taking
counsel
with
any
judas
is
our
brother
and
you
have
grievously
insulted
him
so
says
the
master
shame
on
you
brother
in
the
doorway
stood
judas
pale
and
with
a
distorted
smile
on
his
face
with
a
light
movement
john
went
up
to
him
and
kissed
him
three
times
after
him
glancing
round
at
one
another
james
philip
and
the
others
came
up
shamefacedly
and
after
each
kiss
judas
wiped
his
mouth
but
gave
a
loud
smack
as
though
the
sound
afforded
him
pleasure
peter
came
up
last
we
were
all
stupid
all
blind
judas
he
alone
sees
he
alone
is
wise
may
i
kiss
you
why
not
kiss
away
said
judas
as
in
consent
peter
kissed
him
vigorously
and
said
aloud
in
his
ear
but
i
almost
choked
you
the
others
kissed
you
in
the
usual
way
but
i
kissed
you
on
the
throat
did
it
hurt
you
a
i
will
go
and
tell
him
all
i
was
angry
even
with
him
said
peter
sadly
trying
noiselessly
to
open
the
door
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
thomas
asked
john
severely
he
it
was
who
looked
after
the
conduct
and
the
conversation
of
the
disciples
i
don
t
know
yet
i
must
and
thomas
thought
long
almost
the
whole
day
the
disciples
had
dispersed
to
their
occupations
and
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
peter
was
shouting
joyfully
but
thomas
was
still
considering
he
would
have
come
to
a
decision
more
quickly
had
not
judas
hindered
him
somewhat
by
continually
following
him
about
with
a
mocking
glance
and
now
and
again
asking
him
in
a
serious
tone
well
thomas
and
how
does
the
matter
progress
then
judas
brought
his
and
shaking
the
money
and
pretending
not
to
look
at
thomas
began
to
count
it
two
three
look
thomas
a
bad
coin
again
oh
what
rascals
people
are
they
even
give
bad
money
as
offerings
and
then
they
will
say
again
that
judas
has
stolen
it
thomas
approached
him
resolutely
for
it
was
already
towards
evening
and
said
he
is
right
judas
let
me
kiss
will
you
thirty
it
s
no
good
i
shall
steal
again
but
how
can
you
steal
when
it
is
neither
yours
nor
another
s
you
will
simply
take
as
much
as
you
want
it
has
taken
you
a
long
time
to
repeat
his
words
don
t
you
value
time
you
clever
thomas
you
seem
to
be
laughing
at
me
and
consider
are
you
doing
well
my
virtuous
thomas
in
repeating
his
words
he
said
something
of
his
own
but
you
do
not
he
really
kissed
me
you
only
defiled
my
mouth
i
can
still
feel
your
moist
lips
upon
mine
it
was
so
disgusting
my
good
thomas
forty
forty
denarii
thomas
won
t
you
check
the
sum
certainly
he
is
our
master
why
then
should
we
not
repeat
the
words
of
our
master
is
judas
collar
torn
away
is
there
now
nothing
to
seize
him
by
the
master
will
go
out
of
the
house
and
judas
will
unexpectedly
steal
three
more
denarii
won
t
you
seize
him
by
the
collar
we
know
now
judas
we
have
not
all
pupils
a
bad
memory
have
not
all
masters
been
deceived
by
their
pupils
but
the
master
has
only
to
lift
the
rod
and
the
pupils
cry
out
we
know
master
but
the
master
goes
to
bed
and
the
pupils
say
did
the
master
teach
us
this
and
so
in
this
case
this
morning
you
called
me
a
thief
this
evening
you
call
me
brother
what
will
you
call
me
judas
laughed
and
lifting
up
the
heavy
rattling
with
ease
went
on
when
a
strong
wind
blows
it
raises
the
dust
and
foolish
people
look
at
the
dust
and
say
look
at
the
wind
but
it
is
only
dust
my
good
thomas
ass
s
dung
trodden
underfoot
the
dust
meets
a
wall
and
lies
down
gently
at
its
foot
but
the
wind
flies
farther
and
farther
my
good
judas
obligingly
pointed
over
the
wall
in
illustration
of
his
meaning
and
laughed
again
i
am
glad
that
you
are
merry
said
thomas
but
it
is
a
great
pity
that
there
is
so
much
malice
in
your
why
should
not
a
man
be
cheerful
who
has
been
kissed
so
much
and
who
is
so
useful
if
i
had
not
stolen
the
three
denarii
would
john
have
known
the
meaning
of
delight
is
it
not
pleasant
to
be
a
hook
on
which
john
may
hang
his
damp
virtue
out
to
dry
and
thomas
his
mind
i
think
that
i
had
better
be
but
i
am
only
joking
my
good
thomas
i
merely
wanted
to
know
whether
you
really
wished
to
kiss
the
old
obnoxious
judas
the
thief
who
stole
the
three
denarii
and
gave
them
to
a
to
a
harlot
exclaimed
thomas
in
surprise
and
did
you
tell
the
master
of
it
again
you
doubt
thomas
yes
to
a
harlot
but
if
you
only
knew
thomas
what
an
unfortunate
woman
she
was
for
two
days
she
had
had
nothing
to
are
you
sure
of
that
said
thomas
in
confusion
yes
of
course
i
am
i
myself
spent
two
days
with
her
and
saw
that
she
ate
and
drank
nothing
except
red
wine
she
tottered
from
exhaustion
and
i
was
always
falling
down
with
thereupon
thomas
got
up
quickly
and
when
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
away
he
flung
out
at
judas
you
seem
to
be
possessed
of
satan
and
as
he
went
away
he
heard
in
the
approaching
twilight
how
dolefully
the
heavy
rattled
in
judas
hands
and
judas
seemed
to
laugh
but
the
very
next
day
thomas
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
misjudged
judas
so
simple
so
gentle
and
at
the
same
time
so
serious
was
iscariot
he
neither
grimaced
nor
made
jokes
he
was
neither
obsequious
nor
scurrilous
but
quietly
and
unobtrusively
went
about
his
work
of
catering
he
was
as
active
as
formerly
as
though
he
did
not
have
two
feet
like
other
people
but
a
whole
dozen
of
them
and
ran
noiselessly
without
that
squeaking
sobbing
and
laughter
of
a
hyena
with
which
he
formerly
accompanied
his
actions
and
when
jesus
began
to
speak
he
would
seat
himself
quickly
in
a
corner
fold
his
hands
and
feet
and
look
so
kindly
with
his
great
eyes
that
many
observed
it
he
ceased
speaking
evil
of
people
but
rather
remained
silent
so
that
even
the
severe
matthew
deemed
it
possible
to
praise
him
saying
in
the
words
of
solomon
he
that
is
devoid
of
wisdom
despiseth
his
neighbour
but
a
man
of
understanding
holdeth
his
and
he
lifted
up
his
hand
hinting
thereby
at
judas
former
in
a
short
time
all
remarked
this
change
in
him
and
rejoiced
at
it
only
jesus
looked
on
him
still
with
the
same
detached
look
although
he
gave
no
direct
indication
of
his
dislike
and
even
john
for
whom
judas
now
showed
a
profound
reverence
as
the
beloved
disciple
of
jesus
and
as
his
own
champion
in
the
matter
of
the
three
denarii
began
to
treat
him
somewhat
more
kindly
and
even
sometimes
entered
into
conversation
with
him
what
do
you
think
judas
said
he
one
day
in
a
condescending
manner
which
of
us
peter
or
i
will
be
nearest
to
christ
in
his
heavenly
kingdom
judas
meditated
and
then
answered
i
suppose
that
you
but
peter
thinks
that
he
will
laughed
john
no
peter
would
scatter
all
the
angels
with
his
shout
you
have
heard
him
shout
of
course
he
will
quarrel
with
you
and
will
endeavour
to
occupy
the
first
place
as
he
insists
that
he
too
loves
jesus
but
he
is
already
advanced
in
years
and
you
are
young
he
is
heavy
on
his
feet
while
you
run
swiftly
you
will
enter
there
first
with
christ
will
you
not
yes
i
will
not
leave
jesus
john
agreed
on
the
same
day
simon
peter
referred
the
very
same
question
to
judas
but
fearing
that
his
loud
voice
would
be
heard
by
the
others
he
led
judas
out
to
the
farthest
corner
behind
the
house
well
then
what
is
your
opinion
about
it
he
asked
anxiously
you
are
wise
even
the
master
praises
you
for
your
intellect
and
you
will
speak
the
you
of
course
answered
iscariot
without
hesitation
and
peter
exclaimed
with
indignation
i
told
him
so
but
of
course
he
will
try
even
there
to
oust
you
from
the
first
certainly
but
what
can
he
do
when
you
already
occupy
the
place
won
t
you
be
the
first
to
go
there
with
jesus
you
will
not
leave
him
alone
has
he
not
named
you
the
rock
peter
put
his
hand
on
judas
shoulder
and
said
with
warmth
i
tell
you
judas
you
are
the
cleverest
of
us
all
but
why
are
you
so
sarcastic
and
malignant
the
master
does
not
like
it
otherwise
you
might
become
the
beloved
disciple
equally
with
john
but
to
you
neither
and
peter
lifted
his
hand
threateningly
will
i
yield
my
place
next
to
jesus
neither
on
earth
nor
there
do
you
hear
thus
judas
endeavoured
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
all
but
at
the
same
time
he
cherished
hidden
thoughts
in
his
mind
and
while
he
remained
ever
the
same
modest
restrained
and
unobtrusive
person
he
knew
how
to
make
some
especially
pleasing
remark
to
each
thus
to
thomas
he
said
the
fool
believeth
every
word
but
the
prudent
taketh
heed
to
his
while
to
matthew
who
suffered
somewhat
from
excess
in
eating
and
drinking
and
was
ashamed
of
his
weakness
he
quoted
the
words
of
solomon
the
sage
whom
matthew
held
in
high
estimation
the
righteous
eateth
to
the
satisfying
of
his
soul
but
the
belly
of
the
wicked
shall
but
his
pleasant
speeches
were
rare
which
gave
them
the
greater
value
for
the
most
part
he
was
silent
listening
attentively
to
what
was
said
and
always
meditating
when
reflecting
judas
had
an
unpleasant
look
ridiculous
and
at
the
same
time
as
long
as
his
quick
crafty
eye
was
in
motion
he
seemed
simple
and
enough
but
directly
both
eyes
became
fixed
in
an
immovable
stare
and
the
skin
on
his
protruding
forehead
gathered
into
strange
ridges
and
creases
a
distressing
surmise
would
force
itself
on
one
that
under
that
skull
some
very
peculiar
thoughts
were
working
so
thoroughly
apart
peculiar
and
voiceless
were
the
thoughts
which
enveloped
iscariot
in
the
deep
silence
of
secrecy
when
he
was
in
one
of
his
reveries
that
one
would
have
preferred
that
he
should
begin
to
speak
to
move
nay
even
to
tell
lies
for
a
lie
spoken
by
a
human
tongue
had
been
truth
and
light
compared
with
that
hopelessly
deep
and
unresponsive
silence
in
the
dumps
again
judas
peter
would
cry
with
his
clear
voice
and
bright
smile
suddenly
breaking
in
upon
the
sombre
silence
of
judas
thoughts
and
banishing
them
to
some
dark
corner
what
are
you
thinking
about
of
many
things
iscariot
would
reply
with
a
quiet
smile
and
perceiving
apparently
what
a
bad
impression
his
silence
made
upon
the
others
he
began
more
frequently
to
shun
the
society
of
the
disciples
and
spent
much
time
in
solitary
walks
or
would
betake
himself
to
the
flat
roof
and
there
sit
still
and
more
than
once
he
startled
thomas
who
has
unexpectedly
stumbled
in
the
darkness
against
a
grey
heap
out
of
which
the
hands
and
feet
of
judas
suddenly
started
and
his
jeering
voice
was
heard
but
one
day
in
a
specially
brusque
and
strange
manner
judas
recalled
his
former
character
this
happened
on
the
occasion
of
the
quarrel
for
the
first
place
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
peter
and
john
were
disputing
together
hotly
contending
each
for
his
own
place
nearest
to
jesus
they
reckoned
up
their
services
they
measured
the
degrees
of
their
love
for
jesus
they
became
heated
and
noisy
and
even
reviled
one
another
without
restraint
peter
roared
all
red
with
anger
john
was
quiet
and
pale
with
trembling
hands
and
biting
speech
their
quarrel
had
already
passed
the
bounds
of
decency
and
the
master
had
begun
to
frown
when
peter
looked
up
by
chance
on
judas
and
laughed
john
too
looked
at
judas
and
also
smiled
each
of
them
recalled
what
the
cunning
judas
had
said
to
him
and
foretasting
the
joy
of
approaching
triumph
they
with
silent
consent
invited
judas
to
decide
the
matter
peter
called
out
come
now
judas
the
wise
tell
us
who
will
be
first
nearest
to
jesus
he
or
i
but
judas
remained
silent
breathing
heavily
his
eyes
eagerly
questioning
the
quiet
deep
eyes
of
jesus
yes
john
condescendingly
repeated
tell
us
who
will
be
first
nearest
to
without
taking
his
eyes
off
christ
judas
slowly
rose
and
answered
quietly
and
gravely
jesus
let
his
gaze
fall
slowly
and
quietly
striking
himself
on
the
breast
with
a
bony
finger
iscariot
repeated
solemnly
and
sternly
i
i
shall
be
nearest
to
jesus
and
he
went
out
struck
by
his
insolent
freak
the
disciples
remained
silent
but
peter
suddenly
recalling
something
whispered
to
thomas
in
an
unexpectedly
gentle
voice
so
that
is
what
he
is
always
thinking
about
see
chapter
v
just
at
this
time
judas
iscariot
took
the
first
definite
step
towards
the
betrayal
he
visited
the
chief
priest
annas
secretly
he
was
very
roughly
received
but
that
did
not
disturb
him
in
the
least
and
he
demanded
a
long
private
interview
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
the
dry
harsh
old
man
who
looked
at
him
with
contempt
from
beneath
his
heavy
overhanging
eyelids
he
stated
that
he
was
an
honourable
man
who
had
become
one
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
of
nazareth
with
the
sole
purpose
of
exposing
the
impostor
and
handing
him
over
to
the
arm
of
the
law
but
who
is
this
nazarene
asked
annas
contemptuously
making
as
though
he
heard
the
name
of
jesus
for
the
first
time
judas
on
his
part
pretended
to
believe
in
the
extraordinary
ignorance
of
the
chief
priest
and
spoke
in
detail
of
the
preaching
of
jesus
of
his
miracles
of
his
hatred
for
the
pharisees
and
the
temple
of
his
perpetual
infringement
of
the
law
and
eventually
of
his
wish
to
wrest
the
power
out
of
the
hands
of
the
priesthood
and
to
set
up
his
own
personal
kingdom
and
so
cleverly
did
he
mingle
truth
with
lies
that
annas
looked
at
him
more
attentively
and
lazily
remarked
there
are
plenty
of
impostors
and
madmen
in
no
he
is
a
dangerous
person
judas
hotly
contradicted
he
breaks
the
law
and
it
were
better
that
one
man
should
perish
rather
than
the
whole
annas
with
an
approving
nod
said
but
he
apparently
has
many
yes
and
they
it
seems
probable
have
a
great
love
for
him
yes
they
say
that
they
love
him
love
him
much
more
than
but
if
we
try
to
take
him
will
they
not
defend
him
will
they
not
raise
a
tumult
judas
laughed
long
and
maliciously
what
they
those
cowardly
dogs
who
run
if
a
man
but
stoop
down
to
pick
up
a
stone
they
indeed
are
they
really
so
bad
asked
annas
coldly
but
surely
it
is
not
the
bad
who
flee
from
the
good
is
it
not
rather
the
good
who
flee
from
the
bad
ha
ha
they
are
good
and
therefore
they
flee
they
are
good
and
therefore
they
hide
themselves
they
are
good
and
therefore
they
will
appear
only
in
time
to
bury
jesus
they
will
lay
him
in
the
tomb
themselves
you
have
only
to
execute
but
surely
they
love
him
you
yourself
said
people
always
love
their
teacher
but
better
dead
than
alive
while
a
teacher
s
alive
he
may
ask
them
questions
which
they
will
find
difficult
to
answer
but
when
a
teacher
dies
they
become
teachers
themselves
and
then
others
fare
badly
in
turn
ha
ha
annas
looked
piercingly
at
the
traitor
and
his
lips
puckered
which
indicated
that
he
was
smiling
you
have
been
insulted
by
them
i
can
see
can
one
hide
anything
from
the
perspicacity
of
the
astute
annas
you
have
pierced
to
the
very
heart
of
judas
yes
they
insulted
poor
judas
they
said
he
had
stolen
from
them
three
denarii
as
though
judas
were
not
the
most
honest
man
in
israel
they
talked
for
some
time
longer
about
jesus
and
his
disciples
and
of
his
pernicious
influence
on
the
people
of
israel
but
on
this
occasion
the
crafty
cautious
annas
gave
no
decisive
answer
he
had
long
had
his
eyes
on
jesus
and
in
secret
conclave
with
his
own
relatives
and
friends
with
the
authorities
and
the
sadducees
had
decided
the
fate
of
the
prophet
of
galilee
but
he
did
not
trust
judas
who
he
had
heard
was
a
bad
untruthful
man
and
he
had
no
confidence
in
his
flippant
faith
in
the
cowardice
of
the
disciples
and
of
the
people
annas
believed
in
his
own
power
but
he
feared
bloodshed
feared
a
serious
riot
such
as
the
insubordinate
irascible
people
of
jerusalem
lent
itself
to
so
easily
he
feared
in
fact
the
violent
intervention
of
the
roman
authorities
fanned
by
opposition
fertilised
by
the
red
blood
of
the
people
which
vivifies
everything
on
which
it
falls
the
heresy
would
grow
stronger
and
stifle
in
its
folds
annas
the
government
and
all
his
friends
so
when
iscariot
knocked
at
his
door
a
second
time
annas
was
perturbed
in
spirit
and
would
not
admit
him
but
yet
a
third
and
a
fourth
time
iscariot
came
to
him
persistent
as
the
wind
which
beats
day
and
night
against
the
closed
door
and
blows
in
through
its
crevices
i
see
that
the
most
astute
annas
is
afraid
of
something
said
judas
when
at
last
he
obtained
admission
to
the
high
priest
i
am
strong
enough
not
to
fear
anything
annas
answered
haughtily
and
iscariot
stretched
forth
his
hands
and
bowed
abjectly
what
do
you
want
i
wish
to
betray
the
nazarene
to
we
do
not
want
judas
bowed
and
waited
humbly
fixing
his
gaze
on
the
high
priest
go
but
i
am
bound
to
return
am
i
not
revered
annas
you
will
not
be
admitted
go
away
but
yet
again
and
again
judas
called
on
the
aged
annas
and
at
last
was
admitted
dry
and
malicious
worried
with
thought
and
silent
he
gazed
on
the
traitor
and
as
it
were
counted
the
hairs
on
his
knotted
head
judas
also
said
nothing
and
seemed
in
his
turn
to
be
counting
the
somewhat
sparse
grey
hairs
in
the
beard
of
the
high
priest
what
you
here
again
the
irritated
annas
haughtily
jerked
out
as
though
spitting
upon
his
head
i
wish
to
betray
the
nazarene
to
both
held
their
peace
and
continued
to
gaze
attentively
at
each
other
iscariot
s
look
was
calm
but
a
quiet
malice
dry
and
cold
began
slightly
to
prick
annas
like
the
early
morning
rime
of
winter
how
much
do
you
want
for
your
jesus
how
much
will
you
give
annas
with
evident
enjoyment
insultingly
replied
you
are
nothing
but
a
band
of
scoundrels
thirty
pieces
that
s
what
we
will
and
he
quietly
rejoiced
to
see
how
judas
began
to
squirm
and
run
about
agile
and
swift
as
though
he
had
a
whole
dozen
feet
not
two
thirty
pieces
of
silver
for
jesus
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
wild
madness
most
pleasing
to
annas
for
jesus
of
nazareth
you
wish
to
buy
jesus
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
and
you
think
that
jesus
can
be
betrayed
to
you
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
judas
turned
quickly
to
the
wall
and
laughed
in
its
smooth
white
fence
lifting
up
his
long
hands
do
you
hear
thirty
pieces
of
silver
for
jesus
with
the
same
quiet
pleasure
annas
remarked
indifferently
if
you
will
not
deal
go
away
we
shall
find
some
one
whose
work
is
and
like
men
who
throw
useless
rags
from
hand
to
hand
in
the
dirty
and
shout
and
swear
and
abuse
each
other
so
they
embarked
on
a
rabid
and
fiery
bargaining
intoxicated
with
a
strange
rapture
running
and
turning
about
and
shouting
judas
ticked
off
on
his
fingers
the
merits
of
him
whom
he
was
selling
and
the
fact
that
he
is
kind
and
heals
the
sick
is
that
worth
nothing
at
all
in
your
opinion
ah
yes
tell
me
like
an
honest
man
if
you
began
annas
who
was
turning
red
as
he
tried
to
get
in
a
word
his
cold
malice
quickly
warming
up
under
the
burning
words
of
judas
who
however
interrupted
him
shamelessly
that
he
is
young
and
handsome
like
the
narcissus
of
sharon
and
the
lily
of
the
valley
what
is
that
worth
nothing
perhaps
you
will
say
that
he
is
old
and
useless
and
that
judas
is
trying
to
dispose
of
an
old
bird
eh
if
you
annas
tried
to
exclaim
but
judas
stormy
speech
bore
away
his
senile
croak
like
down
upon
the
wind
thirty
pieces
of
silver
that
will
hardly
work
out
to
one
obolus
for
each
drop
of
blood
half
an
obolus
will
not
go
to
a
tear
a
quarter
to
a
groan
and
cries
and
convulsions
and
for
the
ceasing
of
his
heartbeats
and
the
closing
of
his
eyes
is
all
this
to
be
thrown
in
gratis
sobbed
iscariot
advancing
toward
the
high
priest
and
enveloping
him
with
an
insane
movement
of
his
hands
and
fingers
and
with
intervolved
words
includes
everything
said
annas
in
a
choking
voice
and
how
much
will
you
make
out
of
it
yourself
eh
you
wish
to
rob
judas
to
snatch
the
bit
of
bread
from
his
children
no
i
can
t
do
it
i
will
go
on
to
the
and
shout
out
annas
has
robbed
poor
judas
help
wearied
and
grown
quite
dizzy
annas
wildly
stamped
about
the
floor
in
his
soft
slippers
gesticulating
be
off
be
off
but
judas
on
a
sudden
bowed
down
stretching
forth
his
hands
submissively
but
if
you
really
but
why
be
angry
with
poor
judas
who
only
desires
his
children
s
good
you
also
have
children
young
and
we
shall
find
some
one
else
be
gone
but
i
i
did
not
say
that
i
was
unwilling
to
make
a
reduction
did
i
ever
say
that
i
could
not
too
yield
and
do
i
not
believe
you
that
possibly
another
may
come
and
sell
jesus
to
you
for
fifteen
oboli
nay
for
two
for
one
and
bowing
lower
and
lower
wriggling
and
flattering
judas
submissively
consented
to
the
sum
offered
to
him
annas
shamefacedly
with
dry
trembling
hand
paid
him
the
money
and
silently
looking
round
as
though
scorched
lifted
his
head
again
and
again
towards
the
ceiling
and
moving
his
lips
rapidly
waited
while
judas
tested
with
his
teeth
all
the
silver
pieces
one
after
another
there
is
now
so
much
bad
money
about
judas
quickly
explained
this
money
was
devoted
to
the
temple
by
the
pious
said
annas
glancing
round
quickly
and
still
more
quickly
turning
the
ruddy
bald
nape
of
his
neck
to
judas
view
but
can
pious
people
distinguish
between
good
and
bad
money
only
rascals
can
do
judas
did
not
take
the
money
home
but
went
beyond
the
city
and
hid
it
under
a
stone
then
he
came
back
again
quietly
with
heavy
dragging
steps
as
a
wounded
animal
creeps
slowly
to
its
lair
after
a
severe
and
deadly
fight
only
judas
had
no
lair
but
there
was
a
house
and
in
the
house
he
perceived
jesus
weary
and
thin
exhausted
with
continual
strife
with
the
pharisees
who
surrounded
him
every
day
in
the
temple
with
a
wall
of
white
shining
scholarly
foreheads
he
was
sitting
leaning
his
cheek
against
the
rough
wall
apparently
fast
asleep
through
the
open
window
drifted
the
restless
noises
of
the
city
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
peter
was
hammering
as
he
put
together
a
new
table
for
the
meal
humming
the
while
a
quiet
galilean
song
but
he
heard
nothing
he
slept
on
peacefully
and
soundly
and
this
was
he
whom
they
had
bought
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
coming
forward
noiselessly
judas
with
the
tender
touch
of
a
mother
who
fears
to
wake
her
sick
child
with
the
wonderment
of
a
wild
beast
as
it
creeps
from
its
lair
suddenly
charmed
by
the
sight
of
a
white
flowerlet
he
gently
touched
his
soft
locks
and
then
quickly
withdrew
his
hand
once
more
he
touched
him
and
then
silently
crept
out
lord
lord
said
he
and
going
apart
he
wept
long
shrinking
and
wriggling
and
scratching
his
bosom
with
his
nails
and
gnawing
his
shoulders
then
suddenly
he
ceased
weeping
and
gnawing
and
gnashing
his
teeth
and
fell
into
a
sombre
reverie
inclining
his
face
to
one
side
in
the
attitude
of
one
listening
and
so
he
remained
for
a
long
time
doleful
determined
from
every
one
apart
like
fate
itself
judas
surrounded
the
unhappy
jesus
during
those
last
days
of
his
short
life
with
quiet
love
and
tender
care
and
caresses
bashful
and
timid
like
a
maid
in
her
first
love
strangely
sensitive
and
discerning
he
divined
the
minutest
unspoken
wishes
of
jesus
penetrating
to
the
hidden
depth
of
his
feelings
his
passing
fits
of
sorrow
and
distressing
moments
of
weariness
and
wherever
jesus
stepped
his
foot
met
something
soft
and
whenever
he
turned
his
gaze
it
encountered
something
pleasing
formerly
judas
had
not
liked
mary
magdalene
and
the
other
women
who
were
near
jesus
he
had
made
rude
jests
at
their
expense
and
done
them
little
unkindnesses
but
now
he
became
their
friend
their
strange
awkward
ally
with
deep
interest
he
would
talk
with
them
of
the
charming
little
idiosyncrasies
of
jesus
and
persistently
asking
the
same
questions
he
would
thrust
money
into
their
hands
their
very
palms
and
they
brought
a
box
of
very
precious
ointment
which
jesus
liked
so
much
and
anointed
his
feet
he
himself
bought
for
jesus
after
desperate
bargaining
an
expensive
wine
and
then
was
very
angry
when
peter
drank
nearly
all
of
it
up
with
the
indifference
of
a
person
who
looks
only
to
quantity
and
in
that
rocky
jerusalem
almost
devoid
of
trees
flowers
and
greenery
he
somehow
managed
to
obtain
young
spring
flowers
and
green
grass
and
through
these
same
women
to
give
them
to
jesus
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
would
take
up
little
children
in
his
arms
finding
them
somewhere
about
the
courts
and
streets
and
unwillingly
kiss
them
to
prevent
their
crying
and
often
it
would
happen
that
some
swarthy
urchin
with
curly
hair
and
dirty
little
nose
would
climb
up
on
the
knees
of
the
pensive
jesus
and
imperiously
demand
to
be
petted
and
while
they
enjoyed
themselves
together
judas
would
walk
up
and
down
at
one
side
like
a
severe
jailor
who
had
himself
in
springtime
let
a
butterfly
in
to
a
prisoner
and
pretends
to
grumble
at
the
breach
of
discipline
on
an
evening
when
together
with
the
darkness
alarm
took
post
as
sentry
by
the
window
iscariot
would
cleverly
turn
the
conversation
to
galilee
strange
to
himself
but
dear
to
jesus
with
its
still
waters
and
green
banks
and
he
would
jog
the
heavy
peter
till
his
dulled
memory
awoke
and
in
clear
pictures
in
which
everything
was
loud
distinct
full
of
colour
and
solid
there
arose
before
his
eyes
and
ears
the
dear
galilean
life
with
eager
attention
with
mouth
in
fashion
and
with
eyes
laughing
in
anticipation
jesus
would
listen
to
his
gusty
resonant
cheerful
utterance
and
sometimes
laughed
so
at
his
jokes
that
it
was
necessary
to
interrupt
the
story
for
some
minutes
but
john
told
tales
even
better
than
peter
there
was
nothing
ludicrous
nor
startling
about
his
stories
but
everything
seemed
so
pensive
unusual
and
beautiful
that
tears
would
appear
in
jesus
eyes
and
he
would
sigh
softly
while
judas
nudged
mary
magdalene
and
excitedly
whispered
to
her
what
a
narrator
he
is
do
you
hear
yes
no
be
more
attentive
you
women
never
make
good
then
they
would
all
quietly
disperse
to
bed
and
jesus
would
kiss
his
thanks
to
john
and
stroke
kindly
the
shoulder
of
the
tall
peter
and
without
envy
but
with
a
condescending
contempt
judas
would
witness
these
caresses
of
what
importance
were
these
tales
and
kisses
and
sighs
compared
with
what
he
judas
iscariot
the
misshapen
judas
begotten
among
the
rocks
could
tell
them
if
he
chose
chapter
vi
with
one
hand
betraying
jesus
judas
tried
hard
with
the
other
to
frustrate
his
own
plans
he
did
not
indeed
endeavour
to
dissuade
jesus
from
the
last
dangerous
journey
to
jerusalem
as
did
the
women
he
even
inclined
rather
to
the
side
of
the
relatives
of
jesus
and
of
those
amongst
his
disciples
who
looked
for
a
victory
over
jerusalem
as
indispensable
to
the
full
triumph
of
his
cause
but
he
kept
continually
and
obstinately
warning
them
of
the
danger
and
in
lively
colours
depicted
the
threatening
hatred
of
the
pharisees
for
jesus
and
their
readiness
to
commit
any
crime
if
either
secretly
or
openly
they
might
make
an
end
of
the
prophet
of
galilee
each
day
and
every
hour
he
kept
talking
of
this
and
there
was
not
one
of
the
believers
before
whom
judas
had
not
stood
with
uplifted
finger
and
uttered
this
serious
warning
we
must
look
after
jesus
we
must
defend
for
jesus
when
the
hour
but
whether
it
was
the
unlimited
faith
which
the
disciples
had
in
the
power
of
their
master
or
the
consciousness
of
their
own
uprightness
or
whether
it
was
simply
blindness
the
alarming
words
of
judas
were
met
with
a
smile
and
his
continual
advice
provoked
only
a
grumble
when
judas
procured
somewhere
or
other
two
swords
and
brought
them
only
peter
approved
of
them
and
gave
judas
his
meed
of
praise
while
the
others
complained
are
we
soldiers
that
we
should
be
made
to
gird
on
swords
is
jesus
a
captain
of
the
host
and
not
a
prophet
but
if
they
attempt
to
kill
him
they
will
not
dare
when
they
perceive
how
all
the
people
follow
but
if
they
should
dare
what
then
john
replied
disdainfully
one
would
think
judas
that
you
were
the
only
one
who
loved
jesus
and
eagerly
seizing
hold
of
these
words
and
not
in
the
least
offended
judas
began
to
question
impatiently
and
hotly
with
stern
insistency
but
you
love
him
don
t
you
and
there
was
not
one
of
the
believers
who
came
to
jesus
whom
he
did
not
ask
more
than
once
do
you
love
him
dearly
love
him
and
all
answered
that
they
loved
him
he
used
often
to
converse
with
thomas
and
holding
up
his
dry
hooked
forefinger
with
its
long
dirty
nail
in
warning
would
mysteriously
say
look
here
thomas
the
terrible
hour
is
drawing
near
are
you
prepared
for
it
why
did
you
not
take
the
sword
i
brought
you
thomas
would
reply
with
deliberation
we
are
men
unaccustomed
to
the
use
of
arms
if
we
were
to
take
issue
with
the
roman
soldiery
they
would
kill
us
all
one
after
the
other
besides
you
brought
only
two
swords
and
what
could
we
do
with
only
two
we
could
get
more
we
could
take
them
from
the
roman
soldiers
judas
impatiently
objected
and
even
the
serious
thomas
smiled
through
his
overhanging
moustache
ah
judas
judas
but
where
did
you
get
these
they
are
like
roman
i
stole
them
i
could
have
stolen
more
only
some
one
gave
the
alarm
and
i
thomas
considered
a
little
then
said
sorrowfully
again
you
acted
ill
judas
why
do
you
steal
there
is
no
such
thing
as
no
but
they
will
ask
the
soldiers
where
are
your
swords
and
when
they
can
not
find
them
they
will
be
punished
though
the
consequence
was
that
after
the
death
of
jesus
the
disciples
recalled
these
conversations
of
judas
and
determined
that
he
had
wished
to
destroy
them
together
with
the
master
by
inveigling
them
into
an
unequal
and
murderous
conflict
and
once
again
they
cursed
the
hated
name
of
judas
iscariot
the
traitor
but
the
angry
judas
after
each
conversation
would
go
to
the
women
and
weep
they
heard
him
gladly
the
tender
womanly
element
that
there
was
in
his
love
for
jesus
drew
him
near
to
them
and
made
him
simple
comprehensible
and
even
handsome
in
their
eyes
although
as
before
a
certain
amount
of
disdain
was
perceptible
in
his
attitude
towards
them
are
they
men
he
would
bitterly
complain
of
the
disciples
fixing
his
blind
motionless
eye
confidingly
on
mary
magdalene
they
are
not
men
they
have
not
an
oboles
worth
of
blood
in
their
veins
but
then
you
are
always
speaking
ill
of
others
mary
objected
have
i
ever
said
judas
in
surprise
oh
yes
i
have
indeed
spoken
ill
of
them
but
is
there
not
room
for
improvement
in
them
ah
mary
silly
mary
why
are
you
not
a
man
to
carry
a
sword
it
is
so
heavy
i
could
not
lift
it
said
mary
smilingly
but
you
will
lift
it
when
men
are
too
worthless
did
you
give
jesus
the
lily
that
i
found
on
the
mountain
i
got
up
early
to
find
it
and
this
morning
the
sun
was
so
beautiful
mary
was
he
pleased
with
it
did
he
smile
yes
he
was
pleased
he
said
that
its
smell
reminded
him
of
but
surely
you
did
not
tell
him
that
it
was
judas
judas
iscariot
who
got
it
for
him
why
you
asked
me
not
to
tell
yes
certainly
quite
right
said
judas
with
a
sigh
you
might
have
let
it
out
though
women
are
such
chatterers
but
you
did
not
let
it
out
no
you
were
firm
you
are
a
good
woman
mary
you
know
that
i
have
a
wife
somewhere
now
i
should
be
glad
to
see
her
again
perhaps
she
is
not
a
bad
woman
either
i
don
t
know
she
said
judas
was
a
liar
and
malignant
so
i
left
her
but
she
may
be
a
good
woman
do
you
know
how
should
i
know
when
i
have
never
seen
your
wife
true
true
mary
but
what
think
you
are
thirty
pieces
of
silver
a
large
sum
is
it
not
rather
a
small
one
i
should
say
a
small
certainly
certainly
how
much
did
you
get
when
you
were
a
harlot
five
pieces
of
silver
or
ten
you
were
an
expensive
one
were
you
not
mary
magdalene
blushed
and
dropped
her
head
till
her
luxuriant
golden
hair
completely
covered
her
face
so
that
nothing
but
her
round
white
chin
was
visible
how
bad
you
are
judas
i
want
to
forget
about
that
and
you
remind
me
of
it
no
mary
you
must
not
forget
that
why
should
you
let
others
forget
that
you
were
a
harlot
but
you
must
remember
it
is
the
others
who
should
forget
as
soon
as
possible
but
you
should
not
why
should
you
but
it
was
a
sin
he
fears
who
never
committed
a
sin
but
he
who
has
committed
it
what
has
he
to
fear
do
the
dead
fear
death
is
it
not
rather
the
living
no
the
dead
laugh
at
the
living
and
their
thus
by
the
hour
would
they
sit
and
talk
in
friendly
guise
he
already
old
and
misshapen
with
his
bulbous
head
and
monstrous
face
she
young
modest
tender
and
charmed
with
life
as
with
a
story
or
a
dream
but
time
rolled
by
unconcernedly
while
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
lay
under
the
stone
and
the
terrible
day
of
the
betrayal
drew
inevitably
near
already
jesus
had
ridden
into
jerusalem
on
the
ass
s
back
and
the
people
strewing
their
garments
in
the
way
had
greeted
him
with
enthusiastic
cries
of
hosanna
hosanna
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
so
great
was
the
exultation
so
unrestrainedly
did
their
loving
cries
rend
the
skies
that
jesus
wept
but
his
disciples
proudly
said
is
not
this
the
son
of
god
with
us
and
they
themselves
cried
out
with
enthusiasm
hosanna
hosanna
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
evening
it
was
long
before
they
went
to
bed
recalling
the
enthusiastic
and
joyful
reception
peter
was
like
a
madman
as
though
possessed
by
the
demon
of
merriment
and
pride
he
shouted
drowning
all
voices
with
his
leonine
roar
he
laughed
hurling
his
laughter
at
their
heads
like
great
round
stones
he
kept
kissing
john
and
james
and
even
gave
a
kiss
to
judas
he
noisily
confessed
that
he
had
had
great
fears
for
jesus
but
that
he
feared
nothing
now
that
he
had
seen
the
love
of
the
people
for
him
swiftly
moving
his
vivid
watchful
eye
judas
glanced
in
surprise
from
side
to
side
he
meditated
and
then
again
listened
and
looked
then
he
took
thomas
aside
and
pinning
him
as
it
were
to
the
wall
with
his
keen
gaze
he
asked
in
doubt
and
fear
but
with
a
certain
confused
hopefulness
thomas
but
what
if
he
is
right
what
if
he
be
founded
upon
a
rock
and
we
upon
sand
what
then
of
whom
are
you
speaking
how
then
would
it
be
with
judas
iscariot
then
i
should
be
obliged
to
strangle
him
in
order
to
do
right
who
is
deceiving
judas
you
or
he
himself
who
is
deceiving
judas
who
i
don
t
understand
you
judas
you
speak
very
unintelligently
who
is
deceiving
jesus
who
is
right
and
judas
nodded
his
head
and
repeated
like
an
echo
who
is
deceiving
judas
who
and
the
next
day
in
the
way
in
which
judas
raised
his
hand
with
thumb
bent
back
and
by
the
way
in
which
he
looked
at
thomas
the
same
strange
question
was
implied
who
is
deceiving
judas
who
is
right
does
our
author
refer
to
the
roman
sign
of
disapprobation
vertere
or
convertere
pollicem
tr
and
still
more
surprised
and
even
alarmed
was
thomas
when
suddenly
in
the
night
he
heard
the
loud
apparently
glad
voice
of
judas
then
judas
iscariot
will
be
no
more
then
jesus
will
be
no
more
then
there
will
be
thomas
the
stupid
thomas
did
you
ever
wish
to
take
the
earth
and
lift
it
and
then
possibly
hurl
it
away
that
s
impossible
what
are
you
talking
about
judas
it
s
quite
possible
said
iscariot
with
conviction
and
we
will
lift
it
up
some
day
when
you
are
asleep
stupid
thomas
go
to
sleep
i
m
enjoying
myself
when
you
sleep
your
nose
plays
the
galilean
pipe
sleep
but
now
the
believers
were
already
dispersed
about
jerusalem
hiding
in
houses
and
behind
walls
and
the
faces
of
those
that
met
them
looked
mysterious
the
exultation
had
died
down
confused
reports
of
danger
found
their
way
in
peter
with
gloomy
countenance
tested
the
sword
given
to
him
by
judas
and
the
face
of
the
master
became
even
more
melancholy
and
stern
so
swiftly
the
time
passed
and
inevitably
approached
the
terrible
day
of
the
betrayal
lo
the
last
supper
was
over
full
of
grief
and
confused
dread
and
already
had
the
obscure
words
of
jesus
sounded
concerning
some
one
who
should
betray
him
you
know
who
will
betray
him
asked
thomas
looking
at
judas
with
his
clear
almost
transparent
eyes
yes
i
know
judas
replied
harshly
and
decidedly
you
thomas
will
betray
him
but
he
himself
does
not
believe
what
he
says
it
is
full
time
why
does
he
not
call
to
him
the
strong
magnificent
judas
no
longer
by
days
but
by
short
fleeting
hours
was
the
inevitable
time
to
be
measured
it
was
evening
and
evening
stillness
and
long
shadows
lay
upon
the
ground
the
first
sharp
darts
of
the
coming
night
of
mighty
contest
when
a
harsh
sorrowful
voice
was
heard
it
said
dost
thou
know
whither
i
go
lord
i
go
to
betray
thee
into
the
hands
of
thine
and
there
was
a
long
silence
evening
stillness
and
swift
black
shadows
thou
art
silent
lord
thou
commandest
me
to
go
and
again
silence
allow
me
to
remain
but
perhaps
thou
canst
not
or
darest
not
or
wilt
not
and
again
silence
stupendous
like
the
eyes
of
eternity
but
indeed
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
thou
knowest
all
things
why
lookest
thou
thus
at
judas
great
is
the
mystery
of
thy
beautiful
eyes
but
is
mine
less
order
me
to
remain
but
thou
art
silent
thou
art
ever
silent
lord
lord
is
it
for
this
that
in
grief
and
pains
have
i
sought
thee
all
my
life
sought
and
found
free
me
remove
the
weight
it
is
heavier
than
even
mountains
of
lead
dost
thou
hear
how
the
bosom
of
judas
iscariot
is
cracking
under
it
and
the
last
silence
was
abysmal
like
the
last
glance
of
eternity
i
but
the
evening
stillness
woke
not
neither
uttered
cry
nor
plaint
nor
did
its
subtle
air
vibrate
with
the
slightest
tinkle
so
soft
was
the
fall
of
the
retreating
steps
they
sounded
for
a
time
and
then
were
silent
and
the
evening
stillness
became
pensive
stretched
itself
out
in
long
shadows
and
then
grew
dark
and
suddenly
night
coming
to
meet
it
all
atremble
with
the
rustle
of
sadly
leaves
heaved
a
last
sigh
and
was
still
there
was
a
bustle
a
jostle
a
rattle
of
other
voices
as
though
some
one
had
untied
a
bag
of
lively
resonant
voices
and
they
were
falling
out
on
the
ground
by
one
and
two
and
whole
heaps
it
was
the
disciples
talking
and
drowning
them
all
reverberating
from
the
trees
and
walls
and
tripping
up
over
itself
thundered
the
determined
powerful
voice
of
peter
he
was
swearing
that
never
would
he
desert
his
master
lord
said
he
half
in
anger
half
in
grief
lord
i
am
ready
to
go
with
thee
to
prison
and
to
and
quietly
like
the
soft
echo
of
retiring
footsteps
came
the
inexorable
answer
i
tell
thee
peter
the
cock
will
not
crow
this
day
before
thou
dost
deny
me
chapter
vii
the
moon
had
already
risen
when
jesus
prepared
to
go
to
the
mount
of
olives
where
he
had
spent
all
his
last
nights
but
he
tarried
for
some
inexplicable
reason
and
the
disciples
ready
to
start
were
hurrying
him
then
he
said
suddenly
he
that
hath
a
purse
let
him
take
it
and
likewise
his
scrip
and
he
that
hath
no
sword
let
him
sell
his
garment
and
buy
one
for
i
say
unto
you
that
this
that
is
written
must
yet
be
accomplished
in
me
and
he
was
reckoned
among
the
the
disciples
were
surprised
and
looked
at
one
another
in
confusion
peter
replied
lord
we
have
two
swords
he
looked
searchingly
into
their
kind
faces
lowered
his
head
and
said
softly
it
is
the
steps
of
the
disciples
resounded
loudly
in
the
narrow
streets
and
they
were
frightened
by
the
sounds
of
their
own
footsteps
on
the
white
wall
illumined
by
the
moon
their
black
shadows
appeared
and
they
were
frightened
by
their
own
shadows
thus
they
passed
in
silence
through
jerusalem
which
was
absorbed
in
sleep
and
now
they
came
out
of
the
gates
of
the
city
and
in
the
valley
full
of
fantastic
motionless
shadows
the
stream
of
kedron
stretched
before
them
now
they
were
frightened
by
everything
the
soft
murmuring
and
splashing
of
the
water
on
the
stones
sounded
to
them
like
voices
of
people
approaching
them
stealthily
the
monstrous
shades
of
the
rocks
and
the
trees
obstructing
the
road
disturbed
them
and
their
motionlessness
seemed
to
them
to
stir
but
as
they
were
ascending
the
mountain
and
approaching
the
garden
where
they
had
safely
and
quietly
passed
so
many
nights
before
they
were
growing
ever
bolder
from
time
to
time
they
looked
back
at
jerusalem
all
white
in
the
moonlight
and
they
spoke
to
one
another
about
the
fear
that
had
passed
and
those
who
walked
in
the
rear
heard
in
fragments
the
soft
words
of
jesus
he
spoke
about
their
forsaking
him
in
the
garden
they
paused
soon
after
they
had
entered
it
the
majority
of
them
remained
there
and
speaking
softly
began
to
make
ready
for
their
sleep
outspreading
their
cloaks
over
the
transparent
embroidery
of
the
shadows
and
the
moonlight
jesus
tormented
with
uneasiness
and
four
of
his
disciples
went
further
into
the
depth
of
the
garden
there
they
seated
themselves
on
the
ground
which
had
not
yet
cooled
off
from
the
heat
of
the
day
and
while
jesus
was
silent
peter
and
john
lazily
exchanged
words
almost
devoid
of
any
meaning
yawning
from
fatigue
they
spoke
about
the
coolness
of
the
night
about
the
high
price
of
meat
in
jerusalem
and
about
the
fact
that
no
fish
was
to
be
had
in
the
city
they
tried
to
determine
the
exact
number
of
pilgrims
that
had
gathered
in
jerusalem
for
the
festival
and
peter
drawling
his
words
and
yawning
loudly
said
that
they
numbered
while
john
and
his
brother
jacob
assured
him
just
as
lazily
that
they
did
not
number
more
than
suddenly
jesus
rose
quickly
my
soul
is
exceedingly
sorrowful
even
unto
death
tarry
ye
here
and
watch
with
me
he
said
and
departed
hastily
to
the
grove
and
soon
disappeared
amid
its
motionless
shades
and
light
where
did
he
go
said
john
lifting
himself
on
his
elbow
peter
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
of
jesus
and
answered
fatiguedly
i
do
not
and
he
yawned
again
loudly
then
threw
himself
on
his
back
and
became
silent
the
others
also
became
silent
and
their
motionless
bodies
were
soon
absorbed
in
the
sound
sleep
of
fatigue
through
his
heavy
slumber
peter
vaguely
saw
something
white
bending
over
him
some
one
s
voice
resounded
and
died
away
leaving
no
trace
in
his
dimmed
consciousness
simon
are
you
sleeping
and
he
slept
again
and
again
some
soft
voice
reached
his
ear
and
died
away
without
leaving
any
trace
you
could
not
watch
with
me
even
one
hour
oh
master
if
you
only
knew
how
sleepy
i
am
he
thought
in
his
slumber
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
said
it
aloud
and
he
slept
again
and
a
long
time
seemed
to
have
passed
when
suddenly
the
figure
of
jesus
appeared
near
him
and
a
loud
rousing
voice
instantly
awakened
him
and
the
others
you
are
still
sleeping
and
resting
it
is
ended
the
hour
has
come
the
son
of
man
is
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
the
the
disciples
quickly
sprang
to
their
feet
confusedly
seizing
their
cloaks
and
trembling
from
the
cold
of
the
sudden
awakening
through
the
thicket
of
the
trees
a
multitude
of
warriors
and
temple
servants
was
seen
approaching
noisily
illumining
their
way
with
torches
and
from
the
other
side
the
disciples
came
running
quivering
from
cold
their
sleepy
faces
frightened
and
not
yet
understanding
what
was
going
on
they
asked
hastily
what
is
it
who
are
these
people
with
torches
thomas
pale
faced
his
moustaches
in
disorder
his
teeth
chattering
from
chilliness
said
to
peter
they
have
evidently
come
after
now
a
multitude
of
warriors
surrounded
them
and
the
smoky
quivering
light
of
the
torches
dispelled
the
soft
light
of
the
moon
in
front
of
the
warriors
walked
judas
iscariot
quickly
and
sharply
turning
his
quick
eye
searched
for
jesus
he
found
him
rested
his
look
for
an
instant
upon
his
tall
slender
figure
and
quickly
whispered
to
the
priests
whomsoever
i
shall
kiss
that
same
is
he
take
him
and
lead
him
cautiously
lead
him
cautiously
do
you
hear
then
he
moved
quickly
to
jesus
who
waited
for
him
in
silence
and
he
directed
his
straight
sharp
look
like
a
knife
into
his
calm
darkened
eyes
hail
master
he
said
loudly
charging
his
words
of
usual
greeting
with
a
strange
and
stern
meaning
but
jesus
was
silent
and
the
disciples
looked
at
the
traitor
with
horror
not
understanding
how
the
soul
of
a
man
could
contain
so
much
evil
iscariot
threw
a
rapid
glance
at
their
confused
ranks
noticed
their
quiver
which
was
about
to
turn
into
a
loud
trembling
fear
noticed
their
pallor
their
senseless
smiles
the
drowsy
movements
of
their
hands
which
seemed
as
though
fettered
in
iron
at
the
shoulders
and
a
mortal
sorrow
began
to
burn
in
his
heart
akin
to
the
sorrow
christ
had
experienced
before
outstretching
himself
into
a
hundred
ringing
sobbing
strings
he
rushed
over
to
jesus
and
kissed
his
cold
cheek
tenderly
he
kissed
it
so
softly
so
tenderly
with
such
painful
love
and
sorrow
that
if
jesus
had
been
a
flower
upon
a
thin
stalk
it
would
not
have
shaken
from
this
kiss
and
would
not
have
dropped
the
pearly
dew
from
its
pure
petals
judas
said
jesus
and
with
the
lightning
of
his
look
he
illumined
that
monstrous
heap
of
shadows
which
was
iscariot
s
soul
but
he
could
not
penetrate
into
the
bottomless
depth
judas
is
it
with
a
kiss
you
betray
the
son
of
man
and
he
saw
how
that
monstrous
chaos
trembled
and
stirred
speechless
and
stern
like
death
in
its
haughty
majesty
stood
judas
iscariot
and
within
him
a
thousand
impetuous
and
fiery
voices
groaned
and
roared
yes
we
betray
thee
with
the
kiss
of
love
with
the
kiss
of
love
we
betray
thee
to
outrage
to
torture
to
death
with
the
voice
of
love
we
call
together
the
hangmen
from
their
dark
holes
and
we
place
a
cross
and
high
over
the
top
of
the
earth
we
lift
love
crucified
by
love
upon
a
thus
stood
judas
silent
and
cold
like
death
and
the
shouting
and
the
noise
about
jesus
answered
the
cry
of
his
soul
with
the
rude
irresoluteness
of
armed
force
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
vaguely
understood
purpose
the
soldiers
seized
him
and
dragged
him
off
mistaking
their
irresoluteness
for
resistance
their
fear
for
derision
and
mockery
like
a
flock
of
frightened
lambs
the
disciples
stood
huddled
together
not
interfering
yet
disturbing
everybody
even
themselves
only
a
few
of
them
resolved
to
walk
and
act
separately
jostled
from
all
sides
peter
drew
out
the
sword
from
its
sheath
with
difficulty
as
though
he
had
lost
all
his
strength
and
faintly
lowered
it
upon
the
head
of
one
of
the
priests
without
causing
him
any
harm
jesus
observing
this
ordered
him
to
throw
away
the
useless
weapon
and
it
fell
under
foot
with
a
dull
thud
and
so
evidently
had
it
lost
its
sharpness
and
destructive
power
that
it
did
not
occur
to
any
one
to
pick
it
up
so
it
rolled
about
under
foot
until
several
days
afterwards
it
was
found
on
the
same
spot
by
some
children
at
play
who
made
a
toy
of
it
the
soldiers
kept
dispersing
the
disciples
but
they
gathered
together
again
and
stupidly
got
under
the
soldiers
feet
and
this
went
on
so
long
that
at
last
a
contemptuous
rage
mastered
the
soldiery
one
of
them
with
frowning
brow
went
up
to
the
shouting
john
another
rudely
pushed
from
his
shoulder
the
hand
of
thomas
who
was
arguing
with
him
about
something
or
other
and
shook
a
big
fist
right
in
front
of
his
straightforward
transparent
eyes
john
fled
and
thomas
and
james
fled
and
all
the
disciples
as
many
as
were
present
forsook
jesus
and
fled
losing
their
cloaks
knocking
themselves
against
the
trees
tripping
up
against
stones
and
falling
they
fled
to
the
hills
while
in
the
stillness
of
the
moonlight
night
the
ground
rumbled
loudly
beneath
the
tramp
of
many
feet
some
one
whose
name
did
not
transpire
just
risen
from
his
bed
for
he
was
covered
only
with
a
blanket
rushed
excitedly
into
the
crowd
of
soldiers
and
servants
when
they
tried
to
stop
him
and
seized
hold
of
his
blanket
he
gave
a
cry
of
terror
and
took
to
flight
like
the
others
leaving
his
garment
in
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
and
so
he
ran
with
desperate
leaps
and
his
bare
body
glistened
strangely
in
the
moonlight
when
jesus
was
led
away
peter
who
had
hidden
himself
behind
the
trees
came
out
and
followed
his
master
at
a
distance
noticing
another
man
in
front
of
him
who
walked
silently
he
thought
that
it
was
john
and
he
called
him
softly
john
is
that
you
and
is
that
you
peter
answered
the
other
pausing
and
by
the
voice
peter
recognised
the
traitor
peter
why
did
you
not
run
away
together
with
the
others
peter
stopped
and
said
with
contempt
leave
me
satan
judas
began
to
laugh
and
paying
no
further
attention
to
peter
he
advanced
where
the
torches
were
flashing
dimly
and
where
the
clanking
of
the
weapons
mingled
with
the
footsteps
peter
followed
him
cautiously
and
thus
they
entered
the
court
of
the
high
priest
almost
simultaneously
and
mingled
in
the
crowd
of
the
priests
who
were
warming
themselves
at
the
bonfires
judas
warmed
his
bony
hands
morosely
at
the
bonfire
and
heard
peter
saying
loudly
somewhere
behind
him
no
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
evident
that
they
were
insisting
there
that
he
was
one
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
for
peter
repeated
still
louder
but
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
without
turning
around
and
smiling
involuntarily
judas
shook
his
head
affirmatively
and
muttered
that
s
right
peter
do
not
give
up
the
place
near
jesus
to
any
and
he
did
not
see
the
frightened
peter
walk
away
from
the
courtyard
and
from
that
night
until
the
very
death
of
jesus
judas
did
not
see
a
single
one
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
near
him
and
amid
all
that
multitude
there
were
only
two
inseparable
until
death
strangely
bound
together
by
sufferings
he
who
had
been
betrayed
to
abuse
and
torture
and
he
who
had
betrayed
him
like
brothers
they
both
the
betrayed
and
the
betrayer
drank
out
of
the
same
cup
of
sufferings
and
the
fiery
liquid
burned
equally
the
pure
and
the
impure
lips
gazing
fixedly
at
the
which
imparted
a
feeling
of
warmth
to
his
eyes
stretching
out
his
long
shaking
hands
to
the
flame
his
hands
and
feet
forming
a
confused
outline
in
the
trembling
light
and
shade
iscariot
kept
mumbling
in
hoarse
complaint
how
cold
my
god
how
cold
it
is
so
when
the
fishermen
go
away
at
night
leaving
an
expiring
fire
of
upon
the
shore
from
the
dark
depth
of
the
sea
might
something
creep
forth
crawl
up
towards
the
fire
look
at
it
with
wild
intentness
and
dragging
all
its
limbs
up
to
it
mutter
in
hoarse
complaint
how
cold
my
god
how
cold
it
is
suddenly
judas
heard
behind
him
a
burst
of
loud
voices
the
cries
and
laughter
of
the
soldiers
full
of
the
usual
sleepy
greedy
malice
and
lashes
short
frequent
strokes
upon
a
living
body
he
turned
round
a
momentary
anguish
running
through
his
whole
frame
his
very
bones
they
were
scourging
jesus
has
it
come
to
that
he
had
seen
the
soldiers
lead
jesus
away
with
them
to
their
guardroom
the
night
was
already
nearly
over
the
fires
had
sunk
down
and
were
covered
with
ashes
but
from
the
guardroom
was
still
borne
the
sound
of
muffled
cries
laughter
and
invectives
they
were
scourging
jesus
as
one
who
has
lost
his
way
iscariot
ran
nimbly
about
the
empty
courtyard
stopped
in
his
course
lifted
his
head
and
ran
on
again
and
was
surprised
when
he
came
into
collision
with
heaps
of
embers
or
with
the
walls
then
he
clung
to
the
wall
of
the
guardroom
stretched
himself
out
to
his
full
height
and
glued
himself
to
the
window
and
the
crevices
of
the
door
eagerly
examining
what
they
were
doing
he
saw
a
confined
stuffy
room
dirty
like
all
guardrooms
in
the
world
with
bespitten
floor
and
walls
as
greasy
and
stained
as
though
they
had
been
trodden
and
rolled
upon
and
he
saw
the
man
whom
they
were
scourging
they
struck
him
on
the
face
and
head
and
tossed
him
about
like
a
soft
bundle
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
since
he
neither
cried
out
nor
resisted
after
looking
intently
it
actually
appeared
at
moments
as
though
it
was
not
a
living
human
being
but
a
soft
effigy
without
bones
or
blood
it
bent
itself
strangely
like
a
doll
and
in
falling
knocking
its
head
against
the
stone
floor
it
did
not
give
the
impression
of
a
hard
substance
striking
against
a
hard
substance
but
of
something
soft
and
devoid
of
feeling
and
when
one
looked
long
it
became
like
some
strange
endless
game
and
sometimes
it
became
almost
a
complete
illusion
after
one
hard
kick
the
man
or
effigy
fell
slowly
on
its
knees
before
a
sitting
soldier
he
in
turn
flung
it
away
and
turning
over
it
dropped
down
before
the
next
and
so
on
and
on
a
loud
guffaw
arose
and
judas
smiled
too
as
though
the
strong
hand
of
some
one
with
iron
fingers
had
torn
his
mouth
asunder
it
was
the
mouth
of
judas
that
was
deceived
night
dragged
on
and
the
fires
were
still
smouldering
judas
threw
himself
from
the
wall
and
crawled
to
one
of
the
fires
poked
up
the
ashes
rekindled
it
and
although
he
no
longer
felt
the
cold
he
stretched
his
slightly
trembling
hands
over
the
flames
and
began
to
mutter
dolefully
ah
how
painful
my
son
my
son
how
painful
then
he
went
again
to
the
window
which
was
gleaming
yellow
with
a
dull
light
between
the
thick
grating
and
once
more
began
to
watch
them
scourging
jesus
once
before
the
very
eyes
of
judas
appeared
his
swarthy
countenance
now
marred
out
of
human
semblance
and
covered
with
a
forest
of
dishevelled
hair
then
some
one
s
hand
plunged
into
those
locks
threw
the
man
down
and
rhythmically
turning
his
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
began
to
wipe
the
filthy
floor
with
his
face
right
under
the
window
a
soldier
was
sleeping
his
open
mouth
revealing
his
glittering
white
teeth
and
some
one
s
broad
back
with
naked
brawny
neck
barred
the
window
so
that
nothing
more
could
be
seen
and
suddenly
the
noise
ceased
what
s
that
why
are
they
silent
have
they
suddenly
divined
the
truth
momentarily
the
whole
head
of
judas
in
all
its
parts
was
filled
with
the
rumbling
shouting
and
roaring
of
a
thousand
maddened
thoughts
had
they
divined
they
understood
that
this
was
the
very
best
of
men
it
was
so
simple
so
clear
lo
he
is
coming
out
and
behind
him
they
are
abjectly
crawling
yes
he
is
coming
here
to
judas
coming
out
a
victor
a
hero
arbiter
of
the
truth
a
god
who
is
deceiving
judas
who
is
right
but
no
once
more
noise
and
shouting
they
are
scourging
him
again
they
do
not
understand
they
have
not
guessed
they
are
beating
him
harder
more
cruelly
than
ever
the
fires
burn
out
covered
with
ashes
and
the
smoke
above
them
is
as
transparently
blue
as
the
air
and
the
sky
as
bright
as
the
moon
it
is
the
day
approaching
what
is
day
asks
judas
and
lo
everything
begins
to
glow
to
scintillate
to
grow
young
again
and
the
smoke
above
is
no
longer
blue
but
it
is
the
sun
rising
what
is
the
sun
asks
judas
chapter
viii
they
pointed
the
finger
at
judas
and
some
in
contempt
others
with
hatred
and
fear
said
look
that
is
judas
the
traitor
this
already
began
to
be
the
opprobrious
title
to
which
he
had
doomed
himself
throughout
the
ages
thousands
of
years
may
pass
nation
may
supplant
nation
and
still
the
air
will
resound
with
the
words
uttered
with
contempt
and
fear
by
good
and
bad
alike
judas
the
traitor
but
he
listened
imperturbably
to
what
was
said
of
him
dominated
by
a
feeling
of
burning
curiosity
ever
since
the
morning
when
they
led
forth
jesus
from
the
guardroom
after
scourging
him
judas
had
followed
him
strangely
enough
feeling
neither
grief
nor
pain
nor
joy
only
an
unconquerable
desire
to
see
and
hear
everything
though
he
had
had
no
sleep
the
whole
night
his
body
felt
light
when
he
was
crushed
and
prevented
from
advancing
he
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
adroitly
wormed
himself
into
the
front
place
and
not
for
a
moment
did
his
vivid
quick
eye
remain
at
rest
at
the
examination
of
jesus
before
caiaphas
in
order
not
to
lose
a
word
he
hollowed
his
hand
round
his
ear
and
nodded
his
head
in
affirmation
murmuring
just
so
thou
hearest
jesus
but
he
was
a
prisoner
like
a
fly
tied
to
a
thread
which
buzzing
flies
hither
and
thither
but
can
not
for
one
moment
free
itself
from
the
tractable
but
unyielding
thread
certain
stony
thoughts
lay
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
to
these
he
was
firmly
bound
he
knew
not
as
it
were
what
these
thoughts
were
he
did
not
wish
to
stir
them
up
but
he
felt
them
continually
at
times
they
would
come
to
him
all
of
a
sudden
oppress
him
more
and
more
and
begin
to
crush
him
with
their
unimaginable
weight
as
though
the
vault
of
a
rocky
cavern
were
slowly
and
terribly
descending
upon
his
head
then
he
would
grip
his
heart
with
his
hand
and
strive
to
set
his
whole
body
in
motion
as
though
he
were
perishing
with
cold
and
hasten
to
shift
his
eyes
to
a
fresh
place
and
again
to
another
when
they
led
jesus
away
from
caiaphas
he
met
his
weary
eyes
quite
close
and
somehow
or
other
unconsciously
he
gave
him
several
friendly
nods
i
am
here
my
son
i
am
here
he
muttered
hurriedly
and
maliciously
poked
to
some
gaper
in
the
back
who
stood
in
his
way
and
now
in
a
huge
shouting
crowd
they
all
moved
on
to
pilate
for
the
last
examination
and
trial
and
with
the
same
insupportable
curiosity
judas
searched
the
faces
of
the
ever
swelling
multitude
many
were
quite
unknown
to
him
judas
had
never
seen
them
before
but
some
were
there
who
had
cried
hosanna
to
jesus
and
at
each
step
the
number
of
them
seemed
to
increase
well
well
thought
judas
and
his
head
spun
round
as
if
he
were
drunk
the
worst
is
over
directly
they
will
be
crying
he
is
ours
he
is
jesus
what
are
you
about
and
all
will
understand
and
but
the
believers
walked
in
silence
some
hypocritically
smiled
as
if
to
say
the
affair
is
none
of
ours
others
spoke
with
constraint
but
their
low
voices
were
drowned
in
the
rumbling
of
movement
and
the
loud
delirious
shouts
of
his
enemies
and
judas
felt
better
again
suddenly
he
noticed
thomas
cautiously
slipping
through
the
crowd
not
far
off
and
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
he
was
about
to
go
up
to
him
at
the
sight
of
the
traitor
thomas
was
frightened
and
tried
to
hide
himself
but
in
a
little
narrow
street
between
two
walls
judas
overtook
him
thomas
wait
a
bit
thomas
stopped
and
stretching
both
hands
out
in
front
of
him
solemnly
pronounced
the
words
avaunt
satan
iscariot
made
an
impatient
movement
of
the
hands
what
a
fool
you
are
thomas
i
thought
that
you
had
more
sense
than
the
others
satan
indeed
that
requires
letting
his
hands
fall
thomas
asked
in
surprise
but
did
not
you
betray
the
master
i
myself
saw
you
bring
the
soldiers
and
point
him
out
to
them
if
this
is
not
treachery
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
never
mind
that
hurriedly
said
judas
listen
there
are
many
of
you
here
you
must
all
gather
together
and
loudly
demand
give
up
jesus
he
is
ours
they
will
not
refuse
you
they
dare
not
they
themselves
will
what
do
you
mean
what
are
you
thinking
of
said
thomas
with
a
decisive
wave
of
his
hands
have
you
not
seen
what
a
number
of
armed
soldiers
and
servants
of
the
temple
there
are
here
moreover
the
trial
has
not
yet
taken
place
and
we
must
not
interfere
with
the
court
surely
he
understands
that
jesus
is
innocent
and
will
order
his
release
without
you
then
think
so
too
said
judas
thoughtfully
thomas
thomas
what
if
it
be
the
truth
what
then
who
is
right
who
has
deceived
judas
we
were
all
talking
last
night
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
can
not
condemn
the
innocent
but
if
it
does
why
then
what
then
why
then
it
is
no
court
and
it
will
be
the
worse
for
them
when
they
have
to
give
an
account
before
the
real
before
the
real
is
there
any
real
left
sneered
judas
and
all
of
our
party
cursed
you
but
since
you
say
that
you
were
not
the
traitor
i
think
you
ought
to
be
judas
did
not
want
to
hear
him
out
but
turned
right
about
and
hurried
down
the
street
in
the
wake
of
the
retreating
crowd
he
soon
however
slackened
his
pace
mindful
of
the
fact
that
a
crowd
always
travels
slowly
and
that
a
single
pedestrian
will
inevitably
overtake
it
when
pilate
led
jesus
out
from
his
palace
and
set
him
before
the
people
judas
crushed
against
a
column
by
the
heavy
backs
of
the
soldiers
furiously
turning
his
head
about
to
see
something
between
two
shining
helmets
suddenly
felt
clearly
that
the
worst
was
over
he
saw
jesus
in
the
sunshine
high
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
pale
with
a
crown
of
thorns
the
sharp
spikes
of
which
pressed
into
his
forehead
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
an
elevation
visible
from
his
head
to
his
small
sunburnt
feet
and
waited
so
calmly
was
so
serene
in
his
immaculate
purity
that
only
a
blind
man
who
perceived
not
the
very
sun
could
fail
to
see
only
a
madman
would
not
understand
and
the
people
held
their
peace
it
was
so
still
that
judas
heard
the
breathing
of
the
soldier
in
front
of
him
and
how
at
each
breath
a
strap
creaked
somewhere
about
his
body
yes
it
will
soon
be
over
they
will
understand
immediately
thought
judas
and
suddenly
something
strange
like
the
dazzling
joy
of
falling
from
a
giddy
height
into
a
blue
sparkling
abyss
arrested
his
contemptuously
drawing
his
lips
down
to
his
rounded
chin
pilate
flung
to
the
crowd
the
dry
curt
words
as
one
throws
bones
to
a
pack
of
hungry
hounds
thinking
to
cheat
their
longing
for
fresh
blood
and
living
palpitating
flesh
you
have
brought
this
man
before
me
as
a
corrupter
of
the
people
and
behold
i
have
examined
him
before
you
and
i
find
this
man
guiltless
of
that
of
which
you
accuse
him
judas
closed
his
eyes
he
was
waiting
all
the
people
began
to
shout
to
sob
to
howl
with
a
thousand
voices
of
wild
beasts
and
men
put
him
to
death
crucify
him
crucify
him
and
as
though
in
as
though
wishing
in
one
moment
to
plumb
the
very
depths
of
all
possible
degradation
madness
and
shame
the
crowd
cries
out
sobs
and
demands
with
a
thousand
voices
of
wild
beasts
and
men
release
unto
us
barabbas
but
crucify
him
crucify
him
but
the
roman
had
evidently
not
yet
said
his
last
word
over
his
proud
shaven
countenance
there
passed
convulsions
of
disgust
and
anger
he
understood
he
has
understood
all
along
he
speaks
quietly
to
his
attendants
but
his
voice
is
not
heard
in
the
roar
of
the
crowd
what
does
he
say
is
he
ordering
them
to
bring
swords
and
to
smite
those
maniacs
bring
water
what
water
what
for
ah
lo
he
washes
his
hands
why
does
he
wash
his
clean
white
hands
all
adorned
with
rings
he
lifts
them
and
cries
angrily
to
the
people
whom
surprise
holds
in
silence
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
see
ye
to
while
the
water
is
still
dripping
from
his
fingers
on
to
the
marble
pavement
something
soft
prostrates
itself
at
his
feet
and
sharp
burning
lips
kiss
his
hand
which
he
is
powerless
to
withdraw
glue
themselves
to
it
like
tentacles
almost
bite
and
draw
blood
he
looks
down
in
disgust
and
fear
and
sees
a
great
squirming
body
a
strangely
twofold
face
and
two
immense
eyes
so
queerly
diverse
from
one
another
that
as
it
were
not
one
being
but
a
number
of
them
clung
to
his
hands
and
feet
he
heard
a
broken
burning
whisper
o
wise
and
noble
wise
and
and
with
such
a
truly
satanic
joy
did
that
wild
face
blaze
that
with
a
cry
pilate
kicked
him
away
and
judas
fell
backwards
and
there
he
lay
upon
the
stone
flags
like
an
overthrown
demon
still
stretching
out
his
hand
to
the
departing
pilate
and
crying
as
one
passionately
enamoured
o
wise
o
wise
and
noble
then
he
gathered
himself
up
with
agility
and
ran
away
followed
by
the
laughter
of
the
soldiery
evidently
there
was
yet
hope
when
they
come
to
see
the
cross
and
the
nails
then
they
will
understand
and
then
what
then
he
catches
sight
of
the
thomas
in
passing
and
for
some
reason
or
other
reassuringly
nods
to
him
he
overtakes
jesus
being
led
to
execution
the
walking
is
difficult
small
stones
roll
under
the
feet
and
suddenly
judas
feels
that
he
is
tired
he
gives
himself
up
wholly
to
the
trouble
of
deciding
where
best
to
plant
his
feet
he
looks
dully
around
and
sees
mary
magdalene
weeping
and
a
number
of
women
weeping
hair
dishevelled
eyes
red
lips
distorted
all
the
excessive
grief
of
a
tender
woman
s
soul
when
submitted
to
outrage
suddenly
he
revives
and
seizing
the
moment
runs
up
to
jesus
i
go
with
thee
he
hurriedly
whispers
the
soldiers
drive
him
away
with
blows
of
their
whips
and
squirming
so
as
to
avoid
the
blows
and
showing
his
teeth
at
the
soldiers
he
explains
hurriedly
i
go
with
thee
thither
thou
understandest
he
wipes
the
blood
from
his
face
shakes
his
fist
at
one
of
the
soldiers
who
turns
round
and
smiles
and
points
him
out
to
the
others
then
he
looks
for
thomas
but
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
disciples
are
in
the
crowd
that
accompanies
jesus
again
he
is
conscious
of
fatigue
and
drags
one
foot
with
difficulty
after
the
other
as
he
attentively
looks
out
for
the
sharp
white
scattered
pebbles
when
the
hammer
was
uplifted
to
nail
jesus
left
hand
to
the
tree
judas
closed
his
eyes
and
for
a
whole
age
neither
breathed
nor
saw
nor
lived
but
only
listened
but
lo
with
a
grating
sound
iron
strikes
against
iron
time
after
time
dull
short
blows
and
then
the
sharp
nail
penetrating
the
soft
wood
and
separating
its
particles
is
distinctly
heard
one
hand
it
is
not
yet
too
late
the
other
hand
it
is
not
yet
too
late
a
foot
the
other
foot
is
all
lost
he
irresolutely
opens
his
eyes
and
sees
how
the
cross
is
raised
and
rocks
and
is
set
fast
in
the
trench
he
sees
how
the
hands
of
jesus
are
convulsed
by
the
tension
how
painfully
his
arms
stretch
how
the
wounds
grow
wider
and
how
the
exhausted
abdomen
disappears
under
the
ribs
the
arms
stretch
more
and
more
grow
thinner
and
whiter
and
become
dislocated
from
the
shoulders
and
the
wounds
of
the
nails
redden
and
lengthen
gradually
lo
in
a
moment
they
will
be
torn
away
no
it
stopped
all
stopped
only
the
ribs
move
up
and
down
with
the
short
deep
breathing
on
the
very
crown
of
the
hill
the
cross
is
raised
and
on
it
is
the
crucified
jesus
the
horror
and
the
dreams
of
judas
are
realised
he
gets
up
from
his
knees
on
which
for
some
reason
he
has
knelt
and
gazes
around
coldly
thus
does
a
stern
conqueror
look
when
he
has
already
determined
in
his
heart
to
surrender
everything
to
destruction
and
death
and
for
the
last
time
throws
a
glance
over
a
rich
foreign
city
still
alive
with
sound
but
already
under
the
cold
hand
of
death
and
suddenly
as
clearly
as
his
terrible
victory
iscariot
saw
its
ominous
precariousness
what
if
they
should
suddenly
understand
it
is
not
yet
too
late
jesus
still
lives
there
he
gazes
with
entreating
sorrowing
eyes
what
can
prevent
the
thin
film
which
covers
the
eyes
of
mankind
so
thin
that
it
hardly
seems
to
exist
at
all
what
can
prevent
it
from
rending
what
if
they
should
understand
what
if
suddenly
in
all
their
threatening
mass
of
men
women
and
children
they
should
advance
silently
without
a
cry
and
wipe
out
the
soldiery
plunging
them
up
to
their
ears
in
their
own
blood
should
tear
from
the
ground
the
accursed
cross
and
by
the
hands
of
all
who
remain
alive
should
lift
up
the
liberated
jesus
above
the
summit
of
the
hill
hosanna
hosanna
hosanna
no
better
that
judas
should
lie
on
the
ground
better
that
he
should
lie
upon
the
ground
and
gnashing
his
teeth
like
a
dog
should
watch
and
wait
until
all
these
should
rise
up
but
what
has
come
to
time
now
it
almost
stands
still
so
that
one
would
wish
to
push
it
with
the
hands
to
kick
it
beat
it
with
a
whip
like
a
lazy
ass
now
it
rushes
madly
down
some
mountain
and
catches
its
breath
and
stretches
out
its
hand
in
vain
to
stop
itself
there
weeps
the
mother
of
jesus
let
them
weep
what
avail
her
tears
now
nay
the
tears
of
all
the
mothers
in
the
world
what
are
tears
asks
judas
and
madly
pushes
unyielding
time
beats
it
with
his
fists
curses
it
like
a
slave
it
belongs
to
some
one
else
and
therefore
is
unamenable
to
discipline
oh
if
only
it
belonged
to
judas
but
it
belongs
to
all
these
people
who
are
weeping
laughing
chattering
as
in
the
market
it
belongs
to
the
sun
it
belongs
to
the
cross
to
the
heart
of
jesus
which
is
dying
so
slowly
what
an
abject
heart
has
judas
he
lays
his
hand
upon
it
but
it
cries
out
hosanna
so
loud
that
all
may
hear
he
presses
it
to
the
ground
but
it
cries
hosanna
hosanna
like
a
babbler
who
scatters
holy
mysteries
broadcast
through
the
street
be
still
be
still
suddenly
a
loud
broken
lamentation
dull
cries
the
last
hurried
movements
towards
the
cross
what
is
it
have
they
understood
at
last
no
jesus
is
dying
but
can
this
be
yes
jesus
is
dying
his
pale
hands
are
motionless
but
short
convulsions
run
over
his
face
and
breast
and
legs
but
can
this
be
yes
he
is
dying
his
breathing
becomes
less
frequent
it
ceases
no
there
is
yet
one
sigh
jesus
is
still
upon
the
earth
but
is
there
another
no
no
no
jesus
is
dead
it
is
finished
hosanna
hosanna
his
horror
and
his
dreams
are
realised
who
will
now
snatch
the
victory
from
the
hands
of
iscariot
it
is
finished
let
all
people
on
earth
stream
to
golgotha
and
shout
with
their
million
throats
hosanna
hosanna
and
let
a
sea
of
blood
and
tears
be
poured
out
at
its
foot
and
they
will
find
only
the
shameful
cross
and
a
dead
jesus
calmly
and
coldly
iscariot
surveys
the
dead
letting
his
gaze
rest
for
a
moment
on
that
neck
which
he
had
kissed
only
yesterday
with
a
farewell
kiss
and
slowly
goes
away
now
all
time
belongs
to
him
and
he
walks
without
hurry
now
all
the
world
belongs
to
him
and
he
steps
firmly
like
a
ruler
like
a
king
like
one
who
is
infinitely
and
joyfully
alone
in
the
world
he
observes
the
mother
of
jesus
and
says
to
her
sternly
thou
weepest
mother
weep
weep
and
long
will
all
the
mothers
upon
earth
weep
with
thee
until
i
come
with
jesus
and
destroy
what
does
he
mean
is
he
mad
or
is
he
mocking
this
traitor
he
is
serious
and
his
face
is
stern
and
his
eyes
no
longer
dart
about
in
mad
haste
lo
he
stands
still
and
with
cold
attention
views
a
new
diminished
earth
it
has
become
small
and
he
feels
the
whole
of
it
under
his
feet
he
looks
at
the
little
mountains
quietly
reddening
under
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
and
he
feels
the
mountains
under
his
feet
he
looks
at
the
sky
opening
wide
its
azure
mouth
he
looks
at
the
small
round
disc
of
the
sun
which
vainly
strives
to
singe
and
dazzle
and
he
feels
the
sky
and
the
sun
under
his
feet
infinitely
and
joyfully
alone
he
proudly
feels
the
impotence
of
all
forces
which
operate
in
the
world
and
has
cast
them
all
into
the
abyss
he
walks
farther
on
with
quiet
masterful
steps
and
time
goes
neither
forward
nor
back
obediently
it
marches
in
step
with
him
in
all
its
invisible
immensity
it
is
the
end
chapter
ix
as
an
old
cheat
coughing
smiling
fawningly
bowing
incessantly
judas
iscariot
the
traitor
appeared
before
the
sanhedrin
it
was
the
day
after
the
murder
of
jesus
about
there
they
were
all
his
judges
and
murderers
the
aged
annas
with
his
sons
exact
and
disgusting
likenesses
of
their
father
and
his
caiaphas
devoured
by
ambition
and
all
the
other
members
of
the
sanhedrin
whose
names
have
been
snatched
from
the
memory
of
mankind
rich
and
distinguished
sadducees
proud
in
their
power
and
knowledge
of
the
law
in
silence
they
received
the
traitor
their
haughty
faces
remaining
motionless
as
though
no
one
had
entered
and
even
the
very
least
and
most
insignificant
among
them
to
whom
the
others
paid
no
attention
lifted
up
his
face
and
looked
as
though
no
one
had
entered
judas
bowed
and
bowed
and
bowed
and
they
looked
on
in
silence
as
though
it
were
not
a
human
being
that
had
entered
but
only
an
unclean
insect
that
had
crept
in
and
which
they
had
not
observed
but
judas
iscariot
was
not
the
man
to
be
perturbed
they
kept
silence
and
he
kept
on
bowing
and
thought
that
if
it
was
necessary
to
go
on
bowing
till
evening
he
could
do
so
at
length
caiaphas
inquired
impatiently
what
do
you
want
judas
bowed
once
more
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
it
is
i
judas
iscariot
who
betrayed
to
you
jesus
of
well
what
of
that
you
have
received
your
due
go
away
ordered
annas
but
judas
appeared
unconscious
of
the
command
and
continued
bowing
glancing
at
him
caiaphas
asked
annas
how
much
did
you
give
thirty
pieces
of
caiaphas
laughed
and
even
the
annas
laughed
too
and
over
all
their
proud
faces
there
crept
a
smile
of
enjoyment
and
even
the
one
with
the
face
laughed
judas
perceptibly
blanching
hastily
interrupted
with
the
words
that
s
right
certainly
it
was
very
little
but
is
judas
discontented
does
judas
call
out
that
he
has
been
robbed
he
is
satisfied
has
he
not
contributed
to
a
holy
cause
yes
a
holy
do
not
the
most
sage
people
now
listen
to
judas
and
think
he
is
one
of
us
this
judas
iscariot
he
is
our
brother
our
friend
this
judas
iscariot
the
traitor
does
not
annas
want
to
kneel
down
and
kiss
the
hand
of
judas
only
judas
will
not
allow
it
he
is
a
coward
he
is
afraid
they
will
bite
caiaphas
said
drive
the
dog
out
what
s
he
barking
about
get
along
with
you
we
have
no
time
to
listen
to
your
babbling
said
annas
imperturbably
judas
drew
himself
up
and
closed
his
eyes
the
hypocrisy
which
he
had
carried
so
lightly
all
his
life
suddenly
became
an
insupportable
burden
and
with
one
movement
of
his
eyelashes
he
cast
it
from
him
and
when
he
looked
at
annas
again
his
glance
was
simple
direct
and
terrible
in
its
naked
truthfulness
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
this
either
you
want
to
be
driven
out
with
sticks
cried
caiaphas
panting
under
the
weight
of
the
terrible
words
which
he
was
lifting
higher
and
higher
in
order
to
hurl
them
hence
upon
the
heads
of
the
judges
judas
hoarsely
asked
but
you
know
you
know
who
he
was
he
whom
you
condemned
yesterday
and
crucified
we
know
go
away
with
one
word
he
would
straightway
rend
that
thin
film
which
was
spread
over
their
eyes
and
all
the
earth
would
stagger
beneath
the
weight
of
the
merciless
truth
they
had
a
soul
they
should
be
deprived
of
it
they
had
a
life
they
should
lose
their
life
they
had
light
before
their
eyes
eternal
darkness
and
horror
should
cover
them
hosanna
hosanna
and
these
words
these
terrible
words
were
tearing
his
throat
asunder
he
was
no
deceiver
he
was
innocent
and
pure
do
you
hear
judas
deceived
you
he
betrayed
to
you
an
innocent
he
waits
he
hears
the
aged
unconcerned
voice
of
annas
saying
and
is
that
all
you
want
to
say
you
do
not
seem
to
have
understood
me
says
judas
with
dignity
turning
pale
judas
deceived
you
he
was
innocent
you
have
slain
the
he
of
the
face
smiles
but
annas
is
indifferent
annas
yawns
and
caiaphas
yawns
too
and
says
wearily
what
did
they
mean
by
talking
to
me
about
the
intellect
of
judas
iscariot
he
is
simply
a
fool
and
a
bore
what
cries
judas
all
suffused
with
dark
madness
but
who
are
you
the
clever
ones
judas
deceived
you
hear
it
was
not
he
that
he
betrayed
but
you
you
wiseacres
you
the
powerful
you
he
betrayed
to
a
shameful
death
which
will
not
end
throughout
the
ages
thirty
pieces
of
silver
well
well
but
that
is
the
price
of
your
blood
blood
filthy
as
the
which
the
women
throw
out
of
the
gates
of
their
houses
oh
annas
old
grey
stupid
annas
of
the
law
why
did
you
not
give
one
silver
piece
just
one
obolus
more
at
this
price
you
will
go
down
through
the
ages
be
off
cries
caiaphas
growing
purple
in
the
face
but
annas
stops
him
with
a
motion
of
the
hand
and
asks
judas
as
unconcernedly
as
ever
is
that
all
verily
if
i
were
to
go
into
the
desert
and
cry
to
the
wild
beasts
wild
beasts
have
ye
heard
the
price
at
which
men
valued
their
jesus
what
would
the
wild
beasts
do
they
would
creep
out
of
the
lairs
they
would
howl
with
anger
they
would
forget
their
fear
of
mankind
and
would
all
come
here
to
devour
you
if
i
were
to
say
to
the
sea
sea
knowest
thou
the
price
at
which
men
valued
their
jesus
if
i
were
to
say
to
the
mountains
mountains
know
ye
the
price
at
which
men
valued
their
jesus
then
the
sea
and
the
mountains
would
leave
their
places
assigned
to
them
for
ages
and
would
come
here
and
fall
upon
your
heads
does
judas
wish
to
become
a
prophet
he
speaks
so
loud
mockingly
remarks
he
of
the
face
with
an
ingratiating
glance
at
caiaphas
i
saw
a
pale
sun
it
was
looking
at
the
earth
and
saying
where
is
the
man
i
saw
a
scorpion
it
was
sitting
upon
a
stone
and
laughingly
said
where
is
the
man
i
went
near
and
looked
into
its
eyes
and
it
laughed
and
said
where
is
the
man
i
do
not
see
him
where
is
the
man
i
ask
you
i
do
not
see
him
or
is
judas
become
blind
poor
judas
iscariot
and
iscariot
begins
to
weep
aloud
he
was
during
those
moments
like
a
man
out
of
his
mind
and
caiaphas
turned
away
making
a
contemptuous
gesture
with
his
hand
but
annas
considered
for
a
time
and
then
said
i
perceive
judas
that
you
really
have
received
but
little
and
that
disturbs
you
here
is
some
more
money
take
it
and
give
it
to
your
he
threw
something
which
rang
shrilly
the
sound
had
not
died
away
before
another
like
it
strangely
prolonged
the
clinking
judas
had
hastily
flung
the
pieces
of
silver
and
the
oboles
into
the
faces
of
the
high
priest
and
of
the
judges
returning
the
price
paid
for
jesus
the
pieces
of
money
flew
in
a
curved
shower
falling
on
their
faces
and
on
the
table
and
rolling
about
the
floor
some
of
the
judges
closed
their
hands
with
the
palms
outwards
others
leapt
from
their
places
and
shouted
and
scolded
judas
trying
to
hit
annas
threw
the
last
coin
after
which
his
trembling
hand
had
long
been
fumbling
in
his
wallet
spat
in
anger
and
went
out
well
well
he
mumbled
as
he
passed
swiftly
through
the
streets
scaring
the
children
it
seems
that
thou
didst
weep
judas
was
caiaphas
really
right
when
he
said
that
judas
iscariot
was
a
fool
he
who
weeps
in
the
day
of
his
great
revenge
is
not
worthy
of
it
know
st
thou
that
judas
let
not
thine
eyes
deceive
thee
let
not
thine
heart
lie
to
thee
flood
not
the
fire
with
tears
judas
iscariot
the
disciples
were
sitting
in
mournful
silence
listening
to
what
was
going
on
without
there
was
still
danger
that
the
vengeance
of
jesus
enemies
might
not
confine
itself
to
him
and
so
they
were
all
expecting
a
visit
from
the
guard
and
perhaps
more
executions
near
to
john
to
whom
as
the
beloved
disciple
the
death
of
jesus
was
especially
grievous
sat
mary
magdalene
and
matthew
trying
to
comfort
him
in
an
undertone
mary
whose
face
was
swollen
with
weeping
softly
stroked
his
luxurious
curling
hair
with
her
hand
while
matthew
said
didactically
in
the
words
of
solomon
the
long
suffering
is
better
than
a
hero
and
he
that
ruleth
his
own
spirit
than
one
who
taketh
a
at
this
moment
judas
knocked
loudly
at
the
door
and
entered
all
started
up
in
terror
and
at
first
were
not
sure
who
it
was
but
when
they
recognised
the
hated
countenance
the
bulbous
head
they
uttered
a
simultaneous
cry
peter
raised
both
hands
and
shouted
get
out
of
here
traitor
get
out
or
i
will
kill
but
the
others
looked
more
carefully
at
the
face
and
eyes
of
the
traitor
and
said
nothing
merely
whispering
in
terror
leave
him
alone
leave
him
alone
he
is
possessed
with
a
judas
waited
until
they
had
quite
done
and
then
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
hail
ye
eyes
of
judas
iscariot
ye
have
just
seen
the
murderers
lo
where
is
jesus
i
ask
you
where
is
jesus
there
was
something
compelling
in
the
hoarse
voice
of
judas
and
thomas
replied
obediently
you
know
yourself
judas
that
our
master
was
crucified
but
how
came
you
to
permit
it
where
was
your
love
thou
beloved
disciple
and
thou
rock
where
were
you
all
when
they
were
crucifying
your
friend
on
the
tree
what
could
we
do
judge
thou
said
thomas
with
a
gesture
of
protest
thou
asketh
that
thomas
very
well
and
judas
threw
his
head
back
and
fell
upon
him
angrily
he
who
loves
does
not
ask
what
can
be
done
he
goes
and
does
it
he
weeps
he
bites
he
throttles
the
enemy
and
breaks
his
bones
he
that
is
who
loves
if
your
son
were
drowning
would
you
go
into
the
city
and
inquire
of
the
passers
by
what
must
i
do
my
son
is
drowning
no
you
would
rather
throw
yourself
into
the
water
and
drown
with
him
one
who
loved
would
peter
replied
grimly
to
the
violent
speech
of
judas
i
drew
a
sword
but
he
himself
forbade
and
you
obeyed
jeered
judas
peter
peter
how
could
you
listen
to
him
does
he
know
anything
of
men
and
of
fighting
he
who
does
not
submit
to
him
goes
to
hell
then
why
did
you
not
go
peter
hell
fire
what
s
that
now
supposing
you
had
gone
what
good
s
your
soul
to
you
if
you
dare
not
throw
it
into
the
fire
if
you
want
to
silence
cried
john
rising
he
himself
willed
this
sacrifice
his
sacrifice
is
beautiful
is
a
sacrifice
ever
beautiful
beloved
disciple
wherever
there
is
a
sacrifice
then
there
is
an
executioner
and
there
traitors
sacrifice
that
is
suffering
for
one
and
disgrace
for
all
the
others
traitors
traitors
what
have
ye
done
with
the
world
now
they
look
at
it
from
above
and
below
and
laugh
and
cry
look
at
that
world
upon
it
they
crucified
jesus
and
they
spit
on
it
as
i
do
judas
angrily
spat
on
the
ground
he
took
upon
him
the
sin
of
all
mankind
his
sacrifice
is
beautiful
john
insisted
no
you
have
taken
all
sin
upon
yourselves
you
beloved
disciple
will
not
a
race
of
traitors
take
their
beginning
from
you
a
pusillanimous
and
lying
breed
o
blind
men
what
have
ye
done
with
the
earth
you
have
done
your
best
to
destroy
it
ye
will
soon
be
kissing
the
cross
on
which
ye
crucified
jesus
yes
yes
judas
gives
ye
his
word
that
ye
will
kiss
the
cross
judas
don
t
revile
roared
peter
pushing
how
could
we
slay
all
his
enemies
they
are
so
many
and
thou
peter
exclaimed
john
in
anger
dost
thou
not
perceive
that
he
is
possessed
of
satan
leave
us
tempter
thou
rt
full
of
lies
the
teacher
forbade
us
to
but
did
he
forbid
you
to
die
why
are
you
alive
when
he
is
dead
why
do
your
feet
walk
why
does
your
tongue
talk
trash
why
do
your
eyes
blink
when
he
is
dead
motionless
speechless
how
do
your
cheeks
dare
to
be
red
john
when
his
are
pale
how
can
you
dare
to
shout
peter
when
he
is
silent
what
could
you
do
you
ask
judas
and
judas
answers
you
the
magnificent
bold
judas
iscariot
replies
die
you
ought
to
have
fallen
on
the
road
to
have
seized
the
soldiers
by
the
sword
by
the
hands
and
drowned
them
in
a
sea
of
your
own
blood
yes
die
die
better
had
it
been
that
his
father
should
have
cause
to
cry
out
with
horror
when
you
all
enter
there
judas
ceased
with
raised
head
suddenly
he
noticed
the
remains
of
a
meal
upon
the
table
with
strange
surprise
curiously
as
though
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
looked
on
food
he
examined
it
and
slowly
asked
what
is
this
you
have
been
eating
perhaps
you
have
also
been
sleeping
peter
who
had
begun
to
feel
judas
to
be
some
one
who
could
command
obedience
drooping
his
head
tersely
replied
i
slept
i
slept
and
ate
thomas
said
resolutely
and
firmly
this
is
all
untrue
judas
just
consider
if
we
had
all
died
who
would
have
told
the
story
of
jesus
who
would
have
conveyed
his
teaching
to
mankind
if
we
had
all
died
peter
and
john
and
i
but
what
is
the
truth
itself
in
the
mouths
of
traitors
does
it
not
become
a
lie
thomas
thomas
dost
thou
not
understand
that
thou
art
now
only
a
sentinel
at
the
grave
of
dead
truth
the
sentinel
falls
asleep
and
the
thief
cometh
and
carries
away
the
truth
say
where
is
the
truth
cursed
be
thou
thomas
fruitless
and
a
beggar
shalt
thou
be
throughout
the
ages
and
all
you
with
him
accursed
ones
accursed
be
thou
thyself
satan
cried
john
and
james
and
matthew
and
all
the
other
disciples
repeated
his
cry
only
peter
held
his
peace
i
am
going
to
him
said
judas
stretching
his
powerful
hand
on
high
who
will
follow
iscariot
to
jesus
i
i
also
go
with
thee
cried
peter
rising
but
john
and
the
others
stopped
him
in
horror
saying
madman
thou
hast
forgotten
that
he
betrayed
the
master
into
the
hands
of
his
peter
began
to
lament
bitterly
striking
his
breast
with
his
fist
whither
then
shall
i
go
o
lord
whither
shall
i
go
judas
had
long
ago
during
his
solitary
walks
marked
the
place
where
he
intended
to
make
an
end
of
himself
after
the
death
of
jesus
it
was
upon
a
hill
high
above
jerusalem
there
stood
but
one
tree
bent
and
twisted
by
the
wind
which
had
torn
it
on
all
sides
half
withered
one
of
its
broken
crooked
branches
stretched
out
towards
jerusalem
as
though
in
blessing
or
in
threat
and
this
one
judas
had
chosen
on
which
to
hang
a
noose
but
the
walk
to
the
tree
was
long
and
tedious
and
judas
iscariot
was
very
weary
the
small
sharp
stones
scattered
under
his
feet
seemed
continually
to
drag
him
backwards
and
the
hill
was
high
stern
and
malign
exposed
to
the
wind
judas
was
obliged
to
sit
down
several
times
to
rest
and
panted
heavily
while
behind
him
through
the
clefts
of
the
rock
the
mountain
breathed
cold
upon
his
back
thou
too
art
against
me
accursed
one
said
judas
contemptuously
as
he
breathed
with
difficulty
and
swayed
his
heavy
head
in
which
all
the
thoughts
were
now
petrifying
then
he
raised
it
suddenly
and
opening
wide
his
now
fixed
eyes
angrily
muttered
no
they
were
too
bad
for
judas
thou
hearest
jesus
wilt
thou
trust
me
now
i
am
coming
to
thee
meet
me
kindly
i
am
weary
very
weary
then
thou
and
i
embracing
like
brothers
shall
return
to
earth
shall
we
not
again
he
swayed
his
petrifying
head
and
again
he
opened
his
eyes
mumbling
but
maybe
thou
wilt
be
angry
with
judas
when
he
arrives
and
thou
wilt
not
trust
him
and
wilt
send
him
to
hell
well
what
then
i
will
go
to
hell
and
in
thy
hell
fire
i
will
weld
iron
and
weld
iron
and
demolish
thy
heaven
dost
approve
then
thou
wilt
believe
in
me
then
thou
wilt
come
back
with
me
to
earth
wilt
thou
not
jesus
eventually
judas
reached
the
summit
and
the
crooked
tree
and
there
the
wind
began
to
torment
him
and
when
judas
rebuked
it
it
began
to
blow
soft
and
low
and
took
leave
and
flew
away
right
but
as
for
them
they
are
curs
said
judas
making
a
and
since
the
rope
might
fail
him
and
break
he
hung
it
over
a
precipice
so
that
if
it
broke
he
would
be
sure
to
meet
his
death
upon
the
stones
and
before
he
shoved
himself
off
the
brink
with
his
foot
and
hanged
himself
judas
iscariot
once
more
anxiously
prepared
jesus
for
his
coming
yes
meet
me
kindly
jesus
i
am
very
he
leapt
the
rope
strained
but
held
his
neck
stretched
but
his
hands
and
feet
were
crossed
and
hung
down
as
though
damp
he
died
thus
in
the
course
of
two
days
one
after
another
jesus
of
nazareth
and
judas
iscariot
the
traitor
left
the
world
all
the
night
through
like
some
monstrous
fruit
judas
swayed
over
jerusalem
and
the
wind
kept
turning
his
face
now
to
the
city
and
now
to
the
desert
as
though
it
wished
to
exhibit
judas
to
both
city
and
desert
but
in
whichever
direction
his
face
distorted
by
death
was
turned
his
red
eyes
suffused
with
blood
and
now
as
like
one
another
as
two
brothers
incessantly
looked
towards
the
sky
in
the
morning
some
person
perceived
judas
hanging
above
the
city
and
cried
out
in
horror
people
came
and
took
him
down
and
knowing
who
he
was
threw
him
into
a
deep
ravine
into
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
throwing
dead
horses
and
cats
and
other
carrion
the
same
evening
all
the
believers
knew
of
the
terrible
death
of
the
traitor
and
the
next
day
it
was
known
to
all
jerusalem
stony
judaea
knew
of
it
and
green
galilee
and
from
one
sea
to
the
other
distant
as
it
was
the
news
flew
of
the
death
of
the
traitor
neither
faster
nor
slower
but
with
equal
pace
with
time
itself
it
went
and
as
there
is
no
end
to
time
so
will
there
be
no
end
to
the
stories
about
the
traitor
judas
and
his
terrible
death
and
all
both
good
and
bad
will
equally
anathematise
his
shameful
memory
and
among
all
peoples
past
and
present
will
he
remain
alone
in
his
cruel
destiny
judas
iscariot
the
traitor
the
man
who
found
the
truth
chapter
i
i
was
years
old
and
had
just
maintained
my
thesis
for
the
degree
of
doctor
of
mathematics
with
unusual
success
when
i
was
suddenly
seized
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
thrown
into
this
prison
i
shall
not
narrate
to
you
the
details
of
the
monstrous
crime
of
which
i
was
accused
there
are
events
which
people
should
neither
remember
nor
even
know
that
they
may
not
acquire
a
feeling
of
aversion
for
themselves
but
no
doubt
there
are
many
people
among
the
living
who
remember
that
terrible
case
and
the
human
brute
as
the
newspapers
called
me
at
that
time
they
probably
remember
how
the
entire
civilised
society
of
the
land
unanimously
demanded
that
the
criminal
be
put
to
death
and
it
is
due
only
to
the
inexplicable
kindness
of
the
man
at
the
head
of
the
government
at
the
time
that
i
am
alive
and
i
now
write
these
lines
for
the
edification
of
the
weak
and
the
wavering
i
shall
say
briefly
my
father
my
elder
brother
and
my
sister
were
murdered
brutally
and
i
was
supposed
to
have
committed
the
crime
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
really
enormous
inheritance
i
am
an
old
man
now
i
shall
die
soon
and
you
have
not
the
slightest
ground
for
doubting
when
i
say
that
i
was
entirely
innocent
of
the
monstrous
and
horrible
crime
for
which
twelve
honest
and
conscientious
judges
unanimously
sentenced
me
to
death
the
death
sentence
was
finally
commuted
to
imprisonment
for
life
in
solitary
confinement
it
was
merely
a
fatal
linking
of
circumstances
of
grave
and
insignificant
events
of
vague
silence
and
indefinite
words
which
gave
me
the
appearance
and
likeness
of
the
criminal
innocent
though
i
was
but
he
who
would
suspect
me
of
being
toward
my
strict
judges
would
be
profoundly
mistaken
they
were
perfectly
right
perfectly
right
as
people
who
can
judge
things
and
events
only
by
their
appearance
and
who
are
deprived
of
the
ability
to
penetrate
their
own
mysterious
being
they
could
not
act
differently
nor
should
they
have
acted
differently
it
so
happened
that
in
the
game
of
circumstances
the
truth
concerning
my
actions
which
i
alone
knew
assumed
all
the
features
of
an
insolent
and
shameless
lie
and
however
strange
it
may
seem
to
my
kind
and
serious
reader
i
could
establish
the
truth
of
my
innocence
only
by
falsehood
and
not
by
the
truth
later
on
when
i
was
already
in
prison
in
going
over
in
detail
the
story
of
the
crime
and
the
trial
and
picturing
myself
in
the
place
of
one
of
my
judges
i
came
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
each
time
that
i
was
guilty
then
i
produced
a
very
interesting
and
instructive
work
having
set
aside
entirely
the
question
of
truth
and
falsehood
on
general
principles
i
subjected
the
facts
and
the
words
to
numerous
combinations
erecting
structures
even
as
small
children
build
various
structures
with
their
wooden
blocks
and
after
persistent
efforts
i
finally
succeeded
in
finding
a
certain
combination
of
facts
which
though
strong
in
principle
seemed
so
plausible
that
my
actual
innocence
became
perfectly
clear
exactly
and
positively
established
to
this
day
i
remember
the
great
feeling
of
astonishment
mingled
with
fear
which
i
experienced
at
my
strange
and
unexpected
discovery
by
telling
the
truth
i
lead
people
into
error
and
thus
deceive
them
while
by
maintaining
falsehood
i
lead
them
on
the
contrary
to
the
truth
and
to
knowledge
i
did
not
yet
understand
at
that
time
that
like
newton
and
his
famous
apple
i
discovered
unexpectedly
the
great
law
upon
which
the
entire
history
of
human
thought
rests
which
seeks
not
the
truth
but
verisimilitude
the
appearance
of
truth
that
is
the
harmony
between
that
which
is
seen
and
that
which
is
conceived
based
on
the
strict
laws
of
logical
reasoning
and
instead
of
rejoicing
i
exclaimed
in
an
outburst
of
naive
juvenile
despair
where
then
is
the
truth
where
is
the
truth
in
this
world
of
phantoms
and
falsehood
see
my
diary
of
a
prisoner
of
june
i
know
that
at
the
present
time
when
i
have
but
five
or
six
more
years
to
live
i
could
easily
secure
my
pardon
if
i
but
asked
for
it
but
aside
from
my
being
accustomed
to
the
prison
and
for
several
other
important
reasons
of
which
i
shall
speak
later
i
simply
have
no
right
to
ask
for
pardon
and
thus
break
the
force
and
natural
course
of
the
lawful
and
entirely
justified
verdict
nor
would
i
want
to
hear
people
apply
to
me
the
words
a
victim
of
judicial
error
as
some
of
my
gentle
visitors
expressed
themselves
to
my
sorrow
i
repeat
there
was
no
error
nor
could
there
be
any
error
in
a
case
in
which
a
combination
of
definite
circumstances
inevitably
lead
a
normally
constructed
and
developed
mind
to
the
one
and
only
conclusion
i
was
convicted
justly
although
i
did
not
commit
the
crime
such
is
the
simple
and
clear
truth
and
i
live
joyously
and
peacefully
my
last
few
years
on
earth
with
a
sense
of
respect
for
this
truth
the
only
purpose
by
which
i
was
guided
in
writing
these
modest
notes
is
to
show
to
my
indulgent
reader
that
under
the
most
painful
conditions
where
it
would
seem
that
there
remains
no
room
for
hope
or
life
a
human
being
a
being
of
the
highest
order
possessing
a
mind
and
a
will
finds
both
hope
and
life
i
want
to
show
how
a
human
being
condemned
to
death
looked
with
free
eyes
upon
the
world
through
the
grated
window
of
his
prison
and
discovered
the
great
purpose
harmony
and
beauty
of
the
universe
to
the
disgrace
of
those
fools
who
being
free
living
a
life
of
plenty
and
happiness
slander
life
disgustingly
some
of
my
visitors
reproach
me
for
being
haughty
they
ask
me
where
i
secured
the
right
to
teach
and
to
preach
cruel
in
their
reasoning
they
would
like
to
drive
away
even
the
smile
from
the
face
of
the
man
who
has
been
imprisoned
for
life
as
a
murderer
no
just
as
the
kind
and
bright
smile
will
not
leave
my
lips
as
an
evidence
of
a
clear
and
unstained
conscience
so
my
soul
will
never
be
darkened
my
soul
which
has
passed
firmly
through
the
defiles
of
life
which
has
been
carried
by
a
mighty
will
power
across
these
terrible
abysses
and
bottomless
pits
where
so
many
daring
people
have
found
their
heroic
but
alas
fruitless
death
and
if
the
tone
of
my
confessions
may
sometimes
seem
too
positive
to
my
indulgent
reader
it
is
not
at
all
due
to
the
absence
of
modesty
in
me
but
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
i
firmly
believe
that
i
am
right
and
also
to
my
firm
desire
to
be
useful
to
my
neighbour
as
far
as
my
faint
powers
permit
here
i
must
apologise
for
my
frequent
references
to
my
diary
of
a
prisoner
which
is
unknown
to
the
reader
but
the
fact
is
that
i
consider
the
complete
publication
of
my
diary
too
premature
and
perhaps
even
dangerous
begun
during
the
remote
period
of
cruel
disillusions
of
the
shipwreck
of
all
my
beliefs
and
hopes
breathing
boundless
despair
my
note
book
bears
evidence
in
places
that
its
author
was
if
not
in
a
state
of
complete
insanity
on
the
brink
of
insanity
and
if
we
recall
how
contagious
that
illness
is
my
caution
in
the
use
of
my
diary
will
become
entirely
clear
o
blooming
youth
with
an
involuntary
tear
in
my
eye
i
recall
your
magnificent
dreams
your
daring
visions
and
outbursts
your
impetuous
seething
power
but
i
should
not
want
your
return
blooming
youth
only
with
the
greyness
of
the
hair
comes
clear
wisdom
and
that
great
aptitude
for
unprejudiced
reflection
which
makes
of
all
old
men
philosophers
and
often
even
sages
chapter
ii
those
of
my
kind
visitors
who
honour
me
by
expressing
their
delight
and
even
may
this
little
indiscretion
be
forgiven
me
even
their
adoration
of
my
spiritual
clearness
can
hardly
imagine
what
i
was
when
i
came
to
this
prison
the
tens
of
years
which
have
passed
over
my
head
and
which
have
whitened
my
hair
can
not
muffle
the
slight
agitation
which
i
experience
at
the
recollection
of
the
first
moments
when
with
the
creaking
of
the
rusty
hinges
the
fatal
prison
doors
opened
and
then
closed
behind
me
forever
not
endowed
with
literary
talent
which
in
reality
is
an
indomitable
inclination
to
invent
and
to
lie
i
shall
attempt
to
introduce
myself
to
my
indulgent
reader
exactly
as
i
was
at
that
remote
time
i
was
a
young
man
years
of
age
as
i
had
occasion
to
mention
before
unrestrained
impetuous
given
to
abrupt
deviations
a
certain
dreaminess
peculiar
to
my
age
a
which
was
easily
offended
and
which
revolted
at
the
slightest
insignificant
provocation
a
passionate
impetuosity
in
solving
world
problems
fits
of
melancholy
alternated
by
equally
wild
fits
of
merriment
all
this
gave
the
young
mathematician
a
character
of
extreme
unsteadiness
of
sad
and
harsh
discord
i
must
also
mention
the
extreme
pride
a
family
trait
which
i
inherited
from
my
mother
and
which
often
hindered
me
from
taking
the
advice
of
riper
and
more
experienced
people
than
myself
also
my
extreme
obstinacy
in
carrying
out
my
purposes
a
good
quality
in
itself
which
becomes
dangerous
however
when
the
purpose
in
question
is
not
sufficiently
well
founded
and
considered
thus
during
the
first
days
of
my
confinement
i
behaved
like
all
other
fools
who
are
thrown
into
prison
i
shouted
loudly
and
of
course
vainly
about
my
innocence
i
demanded
violently
my
immediate
freedom
and
even
beat
against
the
door
and
the
walls
with
my
fists
the
door
and
the
walls
naturally
remained
mute
while
i
caused
myself
a
rather
sharp
pain
i
remember
i
even
beat
my
head
against
the
wall
and
for
hours
i
lay
unconscious
on
the
stone
floor
of
my
cell
and
for
some
time
when
i
had
grown
desperate
i
refused
food
until
the
persistent
demands
of
my
organism
defeated
my
obstinacy
i
cursed
my
judges
and
threatened
them
with
merciless
vengeance
at
last
i
commenced
to
regard
all
human
life
the
whole
world
even
heaven
as
an
enormous
injustice
a
derision
and
a
mockery
forgetting
that
in
my
position
i
could
hardly
be
unprejudiced
i
came
with
the
of
youth
with
the
sickly
pain
of
a
prisoner
gradually
to
the
complete
negation
of
life
and
its
great
meaning
those
were
indeed
terrible
days
and
nights
when
crushed
by
the
walls
getting
no
answer
to
any
of
my
questions
i
paced
my
cell
endlessly
and
hurled
one
after
another
into
the
dark
abyss
all
the
great
valuables
which
life
has
bestowed
upon
us
friendship
love
reason
and
justice
in
some
justification
to
myself
i
may
mention
the
fact
that
during
the
first
and
most
painful
years
of
my
imprisonment
a
series
of
events
happened
which
reflected
themselves
rather
painfully
upon
my
psychic
nature
thus
i
learned
with
the
profoundest
indignation
that
the
girl
whose
name
i
shall
not
mention
and
who
was
to
become
my
wife
married
another
man
she
was
one
of
the
few
who
believed
in
my
innocence
at
the
last
parting
she
swore
to
me
to
remain
faithful
to
me
unto
death
and
rather
to
die
than
betray
her
love
for
me
and
within
one
year
after
that
she
married
a
man
i
knew
who
possessed
certain
good
qualities
but
who
was
not
at
all
a
sensible
man
i
did
not
want
to
understand
at
that
time
that
such
a
marriage
was
natural
on
the
part
of
a
young
healthy
and
beautiful
girl
but
alas
we
all
forget
our
natural
science
when
we
are
deceived
by
the
woman
we
love
may
this
little
jest
be
forgiven
me
at
the
present
time
mme
is
a
happy
and
respected
mother
and
this
proves
better
than
anything
else
how
wise
and
entirely
in
accordance
with
the
demands
of
nature
and
life
was
her
marriage
at
that
time
which
vexed
me
so
painfully
i
must
confess
however
that
at
that
time
i
was
not
at
all
calm
her
exceedingly
amiable
and
kind
letter
in
which
she
notified
me
of
her
marriage
expressing
profound
regret
that
changed
circumstances
and
a
suddenly
awakened
love
compelled
her
to
break
her
promise
to
me
that
amiable
truthful
letter
scented
with
perfume
bearing
the
traces
of
her
tender
fingers
seemed
to
me
a
message
from
the
devil
himself
the
letters
of
fire
burned
my
exhausted
brains
and
in
a
wild
ecstasy
i
shook
the
doors
of
my
cell
and
called
violently
come
let
me
look
into
your
lying
eyes
let
me
hear
your
lying
voice
let
me
but
touch
with
my
fingers
your
tender
throat
and
pour
into
your
death
rattle
my
last
bitter
laugh
from
this
quotation
my
indulgent
reader
will
see
how
right
were
the
judges
who
convicted
me
for
murder
they
had
really
foreseen
in
me
a
murderer
my
gloomy
view
of
life
at
the
time
was
aggravated
by
several
other
events
two
years
after
the
marriage
of
my
fiancee
consequently
three
years
after
the
first
day
of
my
imprisonment
my
mother
died
she
died
as
i
learned
of
profound
grief
for
me
however
strange
it
may
seem
she
remained
firmly
convinced
to
the
end
of
her
days
that
i
had
committed
the
monstrous
crime
evidently
this
conviction
was
an
inexhaustible
source
of
grief
to
her
the
chief
cause
of
the
gloomy
melancholy
which
fettered
her
lips
in
silence
and
caused
her
death
through
paralysis
of
the
heart
as
i
was
told
she
never
mentioned
my
name
nor
the
names
of
those
who
died
so
tragically
and
she
bequeathed
the
entire
enormous
fortune
which
was
supposed
to
have
served
as
the
motive
for
the
murder
to
various
charitable
organisations
it
is
characteristic
that
even
under
such
terrible
conditions
her
motherly
instinct
did
not
forsake
her
altogether
in
a
postscript
to
the
will
she
left
me
a
considerable
sum
which
secures
my
existence
whether
i
am
in
prison
or
at
large
now
i
understand
that
however
great
her
grief
may
have
been
that
alone
was
not
enough
to
cause
her
death
the
real
cause
was
her
advanced
age
and
a
series
of
illnesses
which
had
undermined
her
once
strong
and
sound
organism
in
the
name
of
justice
i
must
say
that
my
father
a
man
was
not
at
all
a
model
husband
and
family
man
by
numerous
betrayals
by
falsehood
and
deception
he
had
led
my
mother
to
despair
constantly
offending
her
pride
and
her
strict
unbribable
truthfulness
but
at
that
time
i
did
not
understand
it
the
death
of
my
mother
seemed
to
me
one
of
the
most
cruel
manifestations
of
universal
injustice
and
called
forth
a
new
stream
of
useless
and
sacrilegious
curses
i
do
not
know
whether
i
ought
to
tire
the
attention
of
the
reader
with
the
story
of
other
events
of
a
similar
nature
i
shall
mention
but
briefly
that
one
after
another
my
friends
who
remained
my
friends
from
the
time
when
i
was
happy
and
free
stopped
visiting
me
according
to
their
words
they
believed
in
my
innocence
and
at
first
warmly
expressed
to
me
their
sympathy
but
our
lives
mine
in
prison
and
theirs
at
liberty
were
so
different
that
gradually
under
the
pressure
of
perfectly
natural
causes
such
as
forgetfulness
official
and
other
duties
the
absence
of
mutual
interests
they
visited
me
ever
more
and
more
rarely
and
finally
ceased
to
see
me
entirely
i
can
not
recall
without
a
smile
that
even
the
death
of
my
mother
even
the
betrayal
of
the
girl
i
loved
did
not
arouse
in
me
such
a
hopelessly
bitter
feeling
as
these
gentlemen
whose
names
i
remember
but
vaguely
now
succeeded
in
wresting
from
my
soul
what
horror
what
pain
my
friends
you
have
left
me
alone
my
friends
do
you
understand
what
you
have
done
you
have
left
me
alone
can
you
conceive
of
leaving
a
human
being
alone
even
a
serpent
has
its
mate
even
a
spider
has
its
comrade
and
you
have
left
a
human
being
alone
you
have
given
him
a
soul
and
left
him
alone
you
have
given
him
a
heart
a
mind
a
hand
for
a
handshake
lips
for
a
kiss
and
you
have
left
him
alone
what
shall
he
do
now
that
you
have
left
him
alone
thus
i
exclaimed
in
my
diary
of
a
prisoner
tormented
by
woeful
perplexities
in
my
juvenile
blindness
in
the
pain
of
my
young
senseless
heart
i
still
did
not
want
to
understand
that
the
solitude
of
which
i
complained
so
bitterly
like
the
mind
was
an
advantage
given
to
man
over
other
creatures
in
order
to
fence
around
the
sacred
mysteries
of
his
soul
from
the
stranger
s
gaze
let
my
serious
reader
consider
what
would
have
become
of
life
if
man
were
robbed
of
his
right
of
his
duty
to
be
alone
in
the
gathering
of
idle
chatterers
amid
the
dull
collection
of
transparent
glass
dolls
that
kill
each
other
with
their
sameness
in
the
wild
city
where
all
doors
are
open
and
all
windows
are
open
look
wearily
through
the
glass
walls
and
observe
the
same
evidences
of
the
hearth
and
the
alcove
only
the
creatures
that
can
be
alone
possess
a
face
while
those
that
know
no
solitude
the
great
blissful
sacred
solitude
of
the
soul
have
snouts
instead
of
faces
and
in
calling
my
friends
perfidious
traitors
i
poor
youth
that
i
was
could
not
understand
the
wise
law
of
life
according
to
which
neither
friendship
nor
love
nor
even
the
tenderest
attachment
of
sister
and
mother
is
eternal
deceived
by
the
lies
of
the
poets
who
proclaimed
eternal
friendship
and
love
i
did
not
want
to
see
that
which
my
indulgent
reader
observes
from
the
windows
of
his
dwelling
how
friends
relatives
mother
and
wife
in
apparent
despair
and
in
tears
follow
their
dead
to
the
cemetery
and
after
a
lapse
of
some
time
return
from
there
no
one
buries
himself
together
with
the
dead
no
one
asks
the
dead
to
make
room
in
the
coffin
and
if
the
wife
exclaims
in
an
outburst
of
tears
oh
bury
me
together
with
him
she
is
merely
expressing
symbolically
the
extreme
degree
of
her
despair
one
could
easily
convince
himself
of
this
by
trying
in
jest
to
push
her
down
into
the
grave
and
those
who
restrain
her
are
merely
expressing
symbolically
their
sympathy
and
understanding
thus
lending
the
necessary
aspect
of
solemn
grief
to
the
funeral
custom
man
must
subject
himself
to
the
laws
of
life
not
of
death
nor
to
the
fiction
of
the
poets
however
beautiful
it
may
be
but
can
the
fictitious
be
beautiful
is
there
no
beauty
in
the
stern
truth
of
life
in
the
mighty
work
of
its
wise
laws
which
subjects
to
itself
with
great
disinterestedness
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
luminaries
as
well
as
the
restless
linking
of
the
tiny
creatures
called
human
beings
chapter
iii
thus
i
lived
sadly
in
my
prison
for
five
or
six
years
the
first
redeeming
ray
flashed
upon
me
when
i
least
expected
it
endowed
with
the
gift
of
imagination
i
made
my
former
fiancee
the
object
of
all
my
thoughts
she
became
my
love
and
my
dream
another
circumstance
which
suddenly
revealed
to
me
the
ground
under
my
feet
was
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
conviction
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
my
escape
from
prison
during
the
first
period
of
my
imprisonment
i
as
a
youthful
and
enthusiastic
dreamer
made
all
kinds
of
plans
for
escape
and
some
of
them
seemed
to
me
entirely
possible
of
realisation
cherishing
deceptive
hopes
this
thought
naturally
kept
me
in
a
state
of
tense
alarm
and
hindered
my
attention
from
concentrating
itself
on
more
important
and
substantial
matters
as
soon
as
i
despaired
of
one
plan
i
created
another
but
of
course
i
did
not
make
any
progress
i
merely
moved
within
a
closed
circle
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
mention
that
each
transition
from
one
plan
to
another
was
accompanied
by
cruel
sufferings
which
tormented
my
soul
just
as
the
eagle
tortured
the
body
of
prometheus
one
day
while
staring
with
a
weary
look
at
the
walls
of
my
cell
i
suddenly
began
to
feel
how
irresistibly
thick
the
stone
was
how
strong
the
cement
which
kept
it
together
how
skilfully
and
mathematically
this
severe
fortress
was
constructed
it
is
true
my
first
sensation
was
extremely
painful
it
was
perhaps
a
horror
of
hopelessness
i
can
not
recall
what
i
did
and
how
i
felt
during
the
two
or
three
months
that
followed
the
first
note
in
my
diary
after
a
long
period
of
silence
does
not
explain
very
much
briefly
i
state
only
that
they
made
new
clothes
for
me
and
that
i
had
grown
stout
the
fact
is
that
after
all
my
hopes
had
been
abandoned
the
consciousness
of
the
impossibility
of
my
escape
once
for
all
extinguished
also
my
painful
alarm
and
liberated
my
mind
which
was
then
already
inclined
to
lofty
contemplation
and
the
joys
of
mathematics
but
the
following
is
the
day
i
consider
as
the
first
real
day
of
my
liberation
it
was
a
beautiful
spring
morning
may
and
the
balmy
invigourating
air
was
pouring
into
the
open
window
while
walking
back
and
forth
in
my
cell
i
unconsciously
glanced
at
each
turn
with
a
vague
interest
at
the
high
window
where
the
iron
grate
outlined
its
form
sharply
and
distinctly
against
the
background
of
the
azure
cloudless
sky
why
is
the
sky
so
beautiful
through
these
bars
i
reflected
as
i
walked
is
not
this
the
effect
of
the
aesthetic
law
of
contrasts
according
to
which
azure
stands
out
prominently
beside
black
or
is
it
not
perhaps
a
manifestation
of
some
other
higher
law
according
to
which
the
infinite
may
be
conceived
by
the
human
mind
only
when
it
is
brought
within
certain
boundaries
for
instance
when
it
is
enclosed
within
a
square
when
i
recalled
that
at
the
sight
of
a
wide
open
window
which
was
not
protected
by
bars
or
of
the
sky
i
had
usually
experienced
a
desire
to
fly
which
was
painful
because
of
its
uselessness
and
absurdity
i
suddenly
began
to
experience
a
feeling
of
tenderness
for
the
bars
tender
gratitude
even
love
forged
by
hand
by
the
weak
human
hand
of
some
ignorant
blacksmith
who
did
not
even
give
himself
an
account
of
the
profound
meaning
of
his
creation
placed
in
the
wall
by
an
equally
ignorant
mason
it
suddenly
represented
in
itself
a
model
of
beauty
nobility
and
power
having
seized
the
infinite
within
its
iron
squares
it
became
congealed
in
cold
and
proud
peace
frightening
the
ignorant
giving
food
for
thought
to
the
intelligent
and
delighting
the
sage
chapter
iv
in
order
to
make
the
further
narrative
clearer
to
my
indulgent
reader
i
am
compelled
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
exclusive
quite
flattering
and
i
fear
not
entirely
deserved
position
which
i
occupy
in
our
prison
on
one
hand
my
spiritual
clearness
my
rare
and
perfect
view
of
life
and
the
nobility
of
my
feelings
which
impress
all
those
who
speak
to
me
and
on
the
other
hand
several
rather
unimportant
favours
which
i
have
done
to
the
warden
have
given
me
a
series
of
privileges
of
which
i
avail
myself
rather
moderately
of
course
not
desiring
to
upset
the
general
plan
and
system
of
our
prison
thus
during
the
weekly
visiting
days
my
visitors
are
not
limited
to
any
special
time
for
their
interviews
and
all
those
who
wish
to
see
me
are
admitted
sometimes
forming
quite
a
large
audience
not
daring
to
accept
altogether
the
assurances
made
somewhat
ironically
by
the
warden
to
the
effect
that
i
would
be
the
pride
of
any
prison
i
may
say
nevertheless
without
any
false
modesty
that
my
words
are
treated
with
proper
respect
and
that
among
my
visitors
i
number
quite
a
few
warm
and
enthusiastic
admirers
both
men
and
women
i
shall
mention
that
the
warden
himself
and
some
of
his
assistants
honour
me
by
their
visits
drawing
from
me
strength
and
courage
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
their
hard
work
of
course
i
use
the
prison
library
freely
and
even
the
archives
of
the
prison
and
if
the
warden
politely
refused
to
grant
my
request
for
an
exact
plan
of
the
prison
it
is
not
at
all
because
of
his
lack
of
confidence
in
me
but
because
such
a
plan
is
a
state
secret
our
prison
is
a
huge
building
situated
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
at
the
edge
of
a
deserted
field
overgrown
with
high
grass
it
attracts
the
attention
of
the
wayfarer
by
its
rigid
outlines
promising
him
peace
and
rest
after
his
endless
wanderings
not
being
plastered
the
building
has
retained
its
natural
dark
red
colour
of
old
brick
and
at
close
view
i
am
told
it
produces
a
gloomy
even
threatening
impression
especially
on
nervous
people
to
whom
the
red
bricks
recall
blood
and
bloody
lumps
of
human
flesh
the
small
dark
flat
windows
with
iron
bars
naturally
complete
the
impression
and
lend
to
the
whole
a
character
of
gloomy
harmony
or
stern
beauty
even
during
good
weather
when
the
sun
shines
upon
our
prison
it
does
not
lose
any
of
its
dark
and
grim
importance
and
is
constantly
reminding
the
people
that
there
are
laws
in
existence
and
that
punishment
awaits
those
who
break
them
my
cell
is
on
the
fifth
story
and
my
grated
window
commands
a
splendid
view
of
the
distant
city
and
a
part
of
the
deserted
field
to
the
right
on
the
left
beyond
the
boundary
of
my
vision
are
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
as
i
am
told
the
church
and
the
cemetery
adjoining
it
of
the
existence
of
the
church
and
even
the
cemetery
i
had
known
before
from
the
mournful
tolling
of
the
bells
which
custom
requires
during
the
burial
of
the
dead
quite
in
keeping
with
the
external
style
of
architecture
the
interior
arrangement
of
our
prison
is
also
finished
harmoniously
and
properly
constructed
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
to
the
reader
a
clearer
idea
of
the
prison
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
giving
the
example
of
a
fool
who
might
make
up
his
mind
to
run
away
from
our
prison
admitting
that
the
brave
fellow
possessed
supernatural
herculean
strength
and
broke
the
lock
of
his
room
what
would
he
find
the
corridor
with
numerous
grated
doors
which
could
withstand
cannonading
and
armed
keepers
let
us
suppose
that
he
kills
all
the
keepers
breaks
all
the
doors
and
comes
out
into
the
yard
perhaps
he
may
think
that
he
is
already
free
but
what
of
the
walls
the
walls
which
encircle
our
prison
with
three
rings
of
stone
i
omitted
the
guard
advisedly
the
guard
is
indefatigable
day
and
night
i
hear
behind
my
doors
the
footsteps
of
the
guard
day
and
night
his
eye
watches
me
through
the
little
window
in
my
door
controlling
my
movements
reading
on
my
face
my
thoughts
my
intentions
and
my
dreams
in
the
daytime
i
could
deceive
his
attention
with
lies
assuming
a
cheerful
and
carefree
expression
on
my
face
but
i
have
rarely
met
the
man
who
could
lie
even
in
his
sleep
no
matter
how
much
i
would
be
on
my
guard
during
the
day
at
night
i
would
betray
myself
by
an
involuntary
moan
by
a
twitch
of
the
face
by
an
expression
of
fatigue
or
grief
or
by
other
manifestations
of
a
guilty
and
uneasy
conscience
only
very
few
people
of
unusual
will
power
are
able
to
lie
even
in
their
sleep
skilfully
managing
the
features
of
their
faces
sometimes
even
preserving
a
courteous
and
bright
smile
on
their
lips
when
their
souls
given
over
to
dreams
are
quivering
from
the
horrors
of
a
monstrous
nightmare
but
as
exceptions
these
can
not
be
taken
into
consideration
i
am
profoundly
happy
that
i
am
not
a
criminal
that
my
conscience
is
clear
and
calm
read
my
friend
read
i
say
to
the
watchful
eye
as
i
lay
myself
down
to
sleep
peacefully
you
will
not
be
able
to
read
anything
on
my
face
and
it
was
i
who
invented
the
window
in
the
prison
door
i
feel
that
my
reader
is
astonished
and
smiles
incredulously
mentally
calling
me
an
old
liar
but
there
are
instances
in
which
modesty
is
superfluous
and
even
dangerous
yes
this
simple
and
great
invention
belongs
to
me
just
as
newton
s
system
belongs
to
newton
and
as
kepler
s
laws
of
the
revolution
of
the
planets
belong
to
kepler
later
on
encouraged
by
the
success
of
my
invention
i
devised
and
introduced
in
our
prison
a
series
of
little
innovations
which
were
concerned
only
with
details
thus
the
form
of
chains
and
locks
used
in
our
prison
has
been
changed
the
little
window
in
the
door
was
my
invention
and
if
any
one
should
dare
deny
this
i
would
call
him
a
liar
and
a
scoundrel
i
came
upon
this
invention
under
the
following
circumstances
one
day
during
the
roll
call
a
certain
prisoner
killed
with
the
iron
leg
of
his
bed
the
inspector
who
entered
his
cell
of
course
the
rascal
was
hanged
in
the
yard
of
our
prison
and
the
administration
light
mindedly
grew
calm
but
i
was
in
despair
the
great
purpose
of
the
prison
proved
to
be
wrong
since
such
horrible
deeds
were
possible
how
is
it
that
no
one
had
noticed
that
the
prisoner
had
broken
off
the
leg
of
his
bed
how
is
it
that
no
one
had
noticed
the
state
of
agitation
in
which
the
prisoner
must
have
been
before
committing
the
murder
by
taking
up
the
question
so
directly
i
thus
approached
considerably
the
solution
of
the
problem
and
indeed
after
two
or
three
weeks
had
elapsed
i
arrived
simply
and
even
unexpectedly
at
my
great
discovery
i
confess
frankly
that
before
telling
my
discovery
to
the
warden
of
the
prison
i
experienced
moments
of
a
certain
hesitation
which
was
quite
natural
in
my
position
of
prisoner
to
the
reader
who
may
still
be
surprised
at
this
hesitation
knowing
me
to
be
a
man
of
a
clear
unstained
conscience
i
will
answer
by
a
quotation
from
my
diary
of
a
prisoner
relating
to
that
period
how
difficult
is
the
position
of
the
man
who
is
convicted
though
innocent
as
i
am
if
he
is
sad
if
his
lips
are
sealed
in
silence
and
his
eyes
are
lowered
people
say
of
him
he
is
repenting
he
is
suffering
from
pangs
of
if
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
he
smiles
brightly
and
kindly
the
keeper
thinks
there
by
a
false
and
feigned
smile
he
wishes
to
hide
his
no
matter
what
he
does
he
seems
guilty
such
is
the
force
of
the
prejudice
against
which
it
is
necessary
to
struggle
but
i
am
innocent
and
i
shall
be
myself
firmly
confident
that
my
spiritual
clearness
will
destroy
the
malicious
magic
of
and
on
the
following
day
the
warden
of
the
prison
pressed
my
hand
warmly
expressing
his
gratitude
to
me
and
a
month
later
little
holes
were
made
in
all
doors
in
every
prison
in
the
land
thus
opening
a
field
for
wide
and
fruitful
observation
the
entire
system
of
our
prison
life
gives
me
deep
satisfaction
the
hours
for
rising
and
going
to
bed
for
meals
and
walks
are
arranged
so
rationally
in
accordance
with
the
real
requirements
of
nature
that
soon
they
lose
the
appearance
of
compulsion
and
become
natural
even
dear
habits
only
in
this
way
can
i
explain
the
interesting
fact
that
when
i
was
free
i
was
a
nervous
and
weak
young
man
susceptible
to
colds
and
illness
whereas
in
prison
i
have
grown
considerably
stronger
and
that
for
my
sixty
years
i
am
enjoying
an
enviable
state
of
health
i
am
not
stout
but
i
am
not
thin
either
my
lungs
are
in
good
condition
and
i
have
saved
almost
all
my
teeth
with
the
exception
of
two
on
the
left
side
of
the
jaw
i
am
good
natured
even
tempered
my
sleep
is
sound
almost
without
any
dreams
in
figure
in
which
an
expression
of
calm
power
and
predominates
and
in
face
i
resemble
somewhat
michaelangelo
s
moses
that
is
at
least
what
some
of
my
friendly
visitors
have
told
me
but
even
more
than
by
the
regular
and
healthy
regime
the
strengthening
of
my
soul
and
body
was
helped
by
the
wonderful
yet
natural
peculiarity
of
our
prison
which
eliminates
entirely
the
accidental
and
the
unexpected
from
its
life
having
neither
a
family
nor
friends
i
am
perfectly
safe
from
the
shocks
so
injurious
to
life
which
are
caused
by
treachery
by
the
illness
or
death
of
relatives
let
my
indulgent
reader
recall
how
many
people
have
perished
before
his
eyes
not
of
their
own
fault
but
because
capricious
fate
had
linked
them
to
people
unworthy
of
them
without
changing
my
feeling
of
love
into
trivial
personal
attachments
i
thus
make
it
free
for
the
broad
and
mighty
love
for
all
mankind
and
as
mankind
is
immortal
not
subjected
to
illness
and
as
a
harmonious
whole
it
is
undoubtedly
progressing
toward
perfection
love
for
it
becomes
the
surest
guarantee
of
spiritual
and
physical
soundness
my
day
is
clear
so
are
also
my
days
of
the
future
which
are
coming
toward
me
in
radiant
and
even
order
a
murderer
will
not
break
into
my
cell
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
me
a
mad
automobile
will
not
crush
me
the
illness
of
a
child
will
not
torture
me
cruel
treachery
will
not
steal
its
way
to
me
from
the
darkness
my
mind
is
free
my
heart
is
calm
my
soul
is
clear
and
bright
the
clear
and
rigid
rules
of
our
prison
define
everything
that
i
must
not
do
thus
freeing
me
from
those
unbearable
hesitations
doubts
and
errors
with
which
practical
life
is
filled
true
sometimes
there
penetrates
even
into
our
prison
through
its
high
walls
something
which
ignorant
people
call
chance
or
even
fate
and
which
is
only
an
inevitable
reflection
of
the
general
laws
but
the
life
of
the
prison
agitated
for
a
moment
quickly
goes
back
to
its
habitual
rut
like
a
river
after
an
overflow
to
this
category
of
accidents
belong
the
murder
of
the
inspector
the
rare
and
always
unsuccessful
attempts
at
escape
and
also
the
executions
which
take
place
in
one
of
the
remotest
yards
of
our
prison
there
is
still
another
peculiarity
in
the
system
of
our
prison
which
i
consider
most
beneficial
and
which
gives
to
the
whole
thing
a
character
of
stern
and
noble
justice
left
to
himself
and
only
to
himself
the
prisoner
can
not
count
upon
support
or
upon
that
spurious
wretched
pity
which
so
often
falls
to
the
lot
of
weak
people
disfiguring
thereby
the
fundamental
purposes
of
nature
i
confess
that
i
think
with
a
certain
sense
of
pride
that
if
i
am
now
enjoying
general
respect
and
admiration
if
my
mind
is
strong
my
will
powerful
my
view
of
life
clear
and
bright
i
owe
it
only
to
myself
to
my
power
and
my
perseverance
how
many
weak
people
would
have
perished
in
my
place
as
victims
of
madness
despair
or
grief
but
i
have
conquered
everything
i
have
changed
the
world
i
gave
to
my
soul
the
form
which
my
mind
desired
in
the
desert
working
alone
exhausted
with
fatigue
i
have
erected
a
stately
structure
in
which
i
now
live
joyously
and
calmly
like
a
king
destroy
it
and
i
shall
begin
to
build
a
new
structure
and
in
my
bloody
sweat
i
shall
erect
it
for
i
must
live
forgive
my
involuntary
pathos
in
the
last
lines
which
is
so
unbecoming
to
my
balanced
and
calm
nature
but
it
is
hard
to
restrain
myself
when
i
recall
the
road
i
have
travelled
i
hope
however
that
in
the
future
i
shall
not
darken
the
mood
of
my
reader
with
any
outbursts
of
agitated
feelings
only
he
shouts
who
is
not
confident
of
the
truth
of
his
words
calm
firmness
and
cold
simplicity
are
becoming
to
the
truth
i
do
not
remember
whether
i
told
you
that
the
criminal
who
murdered
my
father
has
not
been
found
as
yet
chapter
v
deviating
from
time
to
time
from
the
calm
form
of
a
historical
narrative
i
must
pause
on
current
events
thus
i
will
permit
myself
to
acquaint
my
readers
in
a
few
lines
with
a
rather
interesting
specimen
of
the
human
species
which
i
have
found
accidentally
in
our
prison
one
afternoon
a
few
days
ago
the
warden
came
to
me
for
the
usual
chat
and
among
other
things
told
me
there
was
a
very
unfortunate
man
in
prison
at
the
time
upon
whom
i
could
exert
a
beneficent
influence
i
expressed
my
willingness
in
the
most
cordial
manner
and
for
several
days
in
succession
i
have
had
long
discussions
with
the
artist
by
permission
of
the
warden
the
spirit
of
hostility
even
of
obstinacy
with
which
to
my
regret
he
met
me
at
his
first
visit
has
now
disappeared
entirely
under
the
influence
of
my
discussion
listening
willingly
and
with
interest
to
my
ever
pacifying
words
he
gradually
told
me
his
rather
unusual
story
after
a
series
of
persistent
questions
he
is
a
man
of
about
or
of
pleasant
appearance
and
rather
good
manners
which
show
that
he
is
a
man
a
certain
quite
natural
unrestraint
in
his
speech
a
passionate
vehemence
with
which
he
talks
about
himself
occasionally
a
bitter
even
ironical
laughter
followed
by
painful
pensiveness
from
which
it
is
difficult
to
arouse
him
even
by
a
touch
of
the
hand
these
complete
the
of
my
new
acquaintance
personally
to
me
he
is
not
particularly
sympathetic
and
however
strange
it
may
seem
i
am
especially
annoyed
by
his
disgusting
habit
of
constantly
moving
his
thin
emaciated
fingers
and
clutching
helplessly
the
hand
of
the
person
with
whom
he
speaks
told
me
very
little
of
his
past
life
well
what
is
there
to
tell
i
was
an
artist
that
s
all
he
repeated
with
a
sorrowful
grimace
and
refused
to
talk
about
the
immoral
act
for
which
he
was
condemned
to
solitary
confinement
i
don
t
want
to
corrupt
you
grandpa
live
honestly
he
would
jest
in
a
somewhat
unbecoming
familiar
tone
which
i
tolerated
simply
because
i
wished
to
please
the
warden
of
the
prison
having
learned
from
the
prisoner
the
real
cause
of
his
sufferings
which
sometimes
assumed
an
acute
form
of
violence
and
threats
during
one
of
these
painful
minutes
when
s
will
power
was
weak
as
a
result
of
insomnia
from
which
he
was
suffering
i
seated
myself
on
his
bed
and
treated
him
in
general
with
fatherly
kindness
and
he
blurted
out
everything
to
me
right
there
and
then
not
desiring
to
tire
the
reader
with
an
exact
reproduction
of
his
hysterical
outbursts
his
laughter
and
his
tears
i
shall
give
only
the
facts
of
his
story
s
grief
at
first
not
quite
clear
to
me
consists
of
the
fact
that
instead
of
paper
or
canvas
for
his
drawings
he
was
given
a
large
slate
and
a
slate
pencil
by
the
way
the
art
with
which
he
mastered
the
material
which
was
new
to
him
is
remarkable
i
have
seen
some
of
his
productions
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
could
satisfy
the
taste
of
the
most
fastidious
expert
of
graphic
arts
personally
i
am
indifferent
to
the
art
of
painting
preferring
live
and
truthful
nature
thus
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
material
before
commencing
a
new
picture
had
to
destroy
the
previous
one
by
wiping
it
off
his
slate
and
this
seemed
to
lead
him
every
time
to
the
verge
of
madness
you
can
not
imagine
what
it
means
he
would
say
clutching
my
hands
with
his
thin
clinging
fingers
while
i
draw
you
know
i
forget
entirely
that
it
is
useless
i
am
usually
very
cheerful
and
i
even
whistle
some
tune
and
once
i
was
even
incarcerated
for
that
as
it
is
forbidden
to
whistle
in
this
cursed
prison
but
that
is
a
trifle
for
i
had
at
least
a
good
sleep
there
but
when
i
finish
my
picture
no
even
when
i
approach
the
end
of
the
picture
i
am
seized
with
a
sensation
so
terrible
that
i
feel
like
tearing
the
brain
from
my
head
and
trampling
it
with
my
feet
do
you
understand
me
i
understand
you
my
friend
i
understand
you
perfectly
and
i
sympathise
with
really
well
then
listen
old
man
i
make
the
last
strokes
with
so
much
pain
with
such
a
sense
of
sorrow
and
hopelessness
as
though
i
were
bidding
to
the
person
i
loved
best
of
all
but
here
i
have
finished
it
do
you
understand
what
it
means
it
means
that
it
has
assumed
life
that
it
lives
that
there
is
a
certain
mysterious
spirit
in
it
and
yet
it
is
already
doomed
to
death
it
is
dead
already
dead
like
a
herring
can
you
understand
it
at
all
i
do
not
understand
it
and
now
imagine
i
fool
that
i
am
i
nevertheless
rejoice
i
cry
and
rejoice
no
i
think
this
picture
i
shall
not
destroy
it
is
so
good
that
i
shall
not
destroy
it
let
it
live
and
it
is
a
fact
that
at
such
times
i
do
not
feel
like
drawing
anything
new
i
have
not
the
slightest
desire
for
it
and
yet
it
is
dreadful
do
you
understand
me
perfectly
my
friend
no
doubt
the
drawing
ceases
to
please
you
on
the
following
day
oh
what
nonsense
you
are
prating
old
man
that
is
exactly
what
he
said
how
can
a
dying
child
cease
to
please
you
of
course
if
he
lived
he
might
have
become
a
scoundrel
but
when
he
is
dying
no
old
man
that
isn
t
it
for
i
am
killing
it
myself
i
do
not
sleep
all
night
long
i
jump
up
i
look
at
it
and
i
love
it
so
dearly
that
i
feel
like
stealing
it
stealing
it
from
whom
what
do
i
know
but
when
morning
sets
in
i
feel
that
i
can
not
do
without
it
that
i
must
take
up
that
cursed
pencil
again
and
create
anew
what
a
mockery
to
create
what
am
i
a
galley
slave
my
friend
you
are
in
a
my
dear
old
man
when
i
begin
to
steal
over
to
the
slate
with
the
sponge
in
my
hand
i
feel
like
a
murderer
it
happens
that
i
go
around
it
for
a
day
or
two
do
you
know
one
day
i
bit
off
a
finger
of
my
right
hand
so
as
not
to
draw
any
more
but
that
of
course
was
only
a
trifle
for
i
started
to
learn
drawing
with
my
left
hand
what
is
this
necessity
for
creating
to
create
by
all
means
create
for
suffering
create
with
the
knowledge
that
it
will
all
perish
do
you
understand
it
finish
it
my
friend
don
t
be
agitated
then
i
will
expound
to
you
my
unfortunately
my
advice
hardly
reached
the
ears
of
in
one
of
those
paroxysms
of
despair
which
frighten
the
warden
of
our
prison
began
to
throw
himself
about
in
his
bed
tear
his
clothes
shout
and
sob
manifesting
in
general
all
the
symptoms
of
extreme
mortification
i
looked
at
the
sufferings
of
the
unfortunate
youth
with
deep
emotion
compared
with
me
he
was
a
youth
vainly
endeavouring
to
hold
his
fingers
which
were
tearing
his
clothes
i
knew
that
for
this
breach
of
discipline
new
incarceration
awaited
him
o
impetuous
youth
i
thought
when
he
had
grown
somewhat
calmer
and
i
was
tenderly
unfolding
his
fine
hair
which
had
become
entangled
how
easily
you
fall
into
despair
a
bit
of
drawing
which
may
in
the
end
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
dealer
in
old
rags
or
a
dealer
in
old
bronze
and
cemented
porcelain
can
cause
you
so
much
suffering
but
of
course
i
did
not
tell
this
to
my
youthful
friend
striving
as
any
one
should
under
similar
circumstances
not
to
irritate
him
by
unnecessary
contradictions
thank
you
old
man
said
apparently
calm
now
to
tell
the
truth
you
seemed
very
strange
to
me
at
first
your
face
is
so
venerable
but
your
eyes
have
you
murdered
anybody
old
man
i
deliberately
quote
the
malicious
and
careless
phrase
to
show
how
in
the
eyes
of
lightminded
and
shallow
people
the
stamp
of
a
terrible
accusation
is
transformed
into
the
stamp
of
the
crime
itself
controlling
my
feeling
of
bitterness
i
remarked
calmly
to
the
impertinent
youth
you
are
an
artist
my
child
to
you
are
known
the
mysteries
of
the
human
face
that
flexible
mobile
and
deceptive
masque
which
like
the
sea
reflects
the
hurrying
clouds
and
the
azure
ether
being
green
the
sea
turns
blue
under
the
clear
sky
and
black
when
the
sky
is
black
when
the
heavy
clouds
are
dark
what
do
you
want
of
my
face
over
which
hangs
an
accusation
of
the
most
cruel
crime
but
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
the
artist
apparently
paid
no
particular
attention
to
my
words
and
continued
in
a
broken
voice
what
am
i
to
do
you
saw
my
drawing
i
destroyed
it
and
it
is
already
a
whole
week
since
i
touched
my
pencil
of
course
he
resumed
thoughtfully
rubbing
his
brow
it
would
be
better
to
break
the
slate
to
punish
me
they
would
not
give
me
another
one
you
had
better
return
it
to
the
very
well
i
may
hold
out
another
week
but
what
then
i
know
myself
even
now
that
devil
is
pushing
my
hand
take
the
pencil
take
the
at
that
moment
as
my
eyes
wandered
distractedly
over
his
cell
i
suddenly
noticed
that
some
of
the
artist
s
clothes
hanging
on
the
wall
were
unnaturally
stretched
and
one
end
was
skilfully
fastened
by
the
back
of
the
cot
assuming
an
air
that
i
was
tired
and
that
i
wanted
to
walk
about
in
the
cell
i
staggered
as
from
a
quiver
of
senility
in
my
legs
and
pushed
the
clothes
aside
the
entire
wall
was
covered
with
drawings
the
artist
had
already
leaped
from
his
cot
and
thus
we
stood
facing
each
other
in
silence
i
said
in
a
tone
of
gentle
reproach
how
did
you
allow
yourself
to
do
this
my
friend
you
know
the
rules
of
the
prison
according
to
which
no
inscriptions
or
drawing
on
the
walls
are
permissible
i
know
no
rules
said
morosely
and
then
i
continued
sternly
this
time
you
lied
to
me
my
friend
you
said
that
you
did
not
take
the
pencil
into
your
hands
for
a
whole
of
course
i
didn
t
said
the
artist
with
a
strange
smile
and
even
a
challenge
even
when
caught
he
did
not
betray
any
signs
of
repentance
and
looked
rather
sarcastic
than
guilty
having
examined
more
closely
the
drawings
on
the
wall
which
represented
human
figures
in
various
positions
i
became
interested
in
the
strange
colour
of
an
unknown
pencil
is
this
iodine
you
told
me
that
you
had
a
pain
and
that
you
secured
no
it
is
blood
i
must
say
frankly
that
i
even
liked
him
at
that
moment
how
did
you
get
it
from
my
from
your
hand
but
how
did
you
manage
to
hide
yourself
from
the
eye
that
is
watching
you
he
smiled
cunningly
and
even
winked
don
t
you
know
that
you
can
always
deceive
if
only
you
want
to
do
it
my
sympathies
for
him
were
immediately
dispersed
i
saw
before
me
a
man
who
was
not
particularly
clever
but
in
all
probability
terribly
spoiled
already
who
did
not
even
admit
the
thought
that
there
are
people
who
simply
can
not
lie
recalling
however
the
promise
i
had
made
to
the
warden
i
assumed
a
calm
air
of
dignity
and
said
to
him
tenderly
as
only
a
mother
could
speak
to
her
child
don
t
be
surprised
and
don
t
condemn
me
for
being
so
strict
my
friend
i
am
an
old
man
i
have
passed
half
of
my
life
in
this
prison
i
have
formed
certain
habits
like
all
old
people
and
submitting
to
all
rules
myself
i
am
perhaps
overdoing
it
somewhat
in
demanding
the
same
of
others
you
will
of
course
wipe
off
these
drawings
yourself
although
i
feel
sorry
for
them
for
i
admire
them
sincerely
and
i
will
not
say
anything
to
the
administration
we
will
forget
all
this
as
if
nothing
had
happened
are
you
satisfied
he
answered
drowsily
very
in
our
prison
where
we
have
the
sad
pleasure
of
being
confined
everything
is
arranged
in
accordance
with
a
most
purposeful
plan
and
is
most
strictly
subjected
to
laws
and
rules
and
the
very
strict
order
on
account
of
which
the
existence
of
your
creations
is
so
short
lived
and
i
may
say
ephemeral
is
full
of
the
profoundest
wisdom
allowing
you
to
perfect
yourself
in
your
art
it
wisely
guards
other
people
against
the
perhaps
injurious
influence
of
your
productions
and
in
any
case
it
completes
logically
finishes
enforces
and
makes
clear
the
meaning
of
your
solitary
confinement
what
does
solitary
confinement
in
our
prison
mean
it
means
that
the
prisoner
should
be
alone
but
would
he
be
alone
if
by
his
productions
he
would
communicate
in
some
way
or
other
with
other
people
outside
by
the
expression
of
s
face
i
noticed
with
a
sense
of
profound
joy
that
my
words
had
produced
on
him
the
proper
impression
bringing
him
back
from
the
realm
of
poetic
inventions
to
the
land
of
stern
but
beautiful
reality
and
raising
my
voice
i
continued
as
for
the
rule
you
have
broken
which
forbids
any
inscription
or
drawing
on
the
walls
of
our
prison
it
is
not
less
logical
years
will
pass
in
your
place
there
may
be
another
prisoner
like
you
and
he
may
see
that
which
you
have
drawn
shall
this
be
tolerated
just
think
of
it
and
what
would
become
of
the
walls
of
our
prison
if
every
one
who
wished
it
were
to
leave
upon
them
his
profane
marks
to
the
devil
with
it
this
is
exactly
how
expressed
himself
he
said
it
loudly
even
with
an
air
of
calmness
what
do
you
mean
to
say
by
this
my
youthful
friend
i
wish
to
say
that
you
may
perish
here
my
old
friend
but
i
shall
leave
this
you
can
t
escape
from
our
prison
i
retorted
sternly
have
you
tried
yes
i
have
he
looked
at
me
incredulously
and
smiled
he
smiled
you
are
a
coward
old
man
you
are
simply
a
miserable
i
a
coward
oh
if
that
puppy
knew
what
a
tempest
of
rage
he
had
aroused
in
my
soul
he
would
have
squealed
for
fright
and
would
have
hidden
himself
on
the
bed
i
a
coward
the
world
has
crumbled
upon
my
head
but
has
not
crushed
me
and
out
of
its
terrible
fragments
i
have
created
a
new
world
according
to
my
own
design
and
plan
all
the
evil
forces
of
life
solitude
imprisonment
treachery
and
falsehood
all
have
taken
up
arms
against
me
but
i
have
subjected
them
all
to
my
will
and
i
who
have
subjected
to
myself
even
my
dreams
i
am
a
coward
but
i
shall
not
tire
the
attention
of
my
indulgent
reader
with
these
lyrical
deviations
which
have
no
bearing
on
the
matter
i
continue
after
a
pause
broken
only
by
s
loud
breathing
i
said
to
him
sadly
i
a
coward
and
you
say
this
to
the
man
who
came
with
the
sole
aim
of
helping
you
of
helping
you
not
only
in
word
but
also
in
deed
you
wish
to
help
me
in
what
way
i
will
get
you
paper
and
the
artist
was
silent
and
his
voice
was
soft
and
timid
when
he
asked
hesitatingly
and
my
drawings
will
remain
yes
they
will
it
is
hard
to
describe
the
vehement
delight
into
which
the
exalted
young
man
was
thrown
naive
and
youth
knows
no
bounds
either
in
grief
or
in
joy
he
pressed
my
hand
warmly
shook
me
disturbing
my
old
bones
he
called
me
friend
father
even
dear
old
phiz
and
a
thousand
other
endearing
and
somewhat
naive
names
to
my
regret
our
conversation
lasted
too
long
and
notwithstanding
the
entreaties
of
the
young
man
who
would
not
part
with
me
i
hurried
away
to
my
cell
i
did
not
go
to
the
warden
of
the
prison
as
i
felt
somewhat
agitated
at
that
remote
time
i
paced
my
cell
until
late
in
the
night
striving
to
understand
what
means
of
escaping
from
our
prison
that
rather
foolish
young
man
could
have
discovered
was
it
possible
to
run
away
from
our
prison
no
i
could
not
admit
and
i
must
not
admit
it
and
gradually
conjuring
up
in
my
memory
everything
i
knew
about
our
prison
i
understood
that
must
have
hit
upon
an
old
plan
which
i
had
long
discarded
and
that
he
would
convince
himself
of
its
impracticability
even
as
i
convinced
myself
it
is
impossible
to
escape
from
our
prison
but
tormented
by
doubts
i
measured
my
lonely
cell
for
a
long
time
thinking
of
various
plans
that
might
relieve
s
position
and
thus
divert
him
from
the
idea
of
making
his
escape
he
must
not
run
away
from
our
prison
under
any
circumstances
then
i
gave
myself
to
peaceful
and
sound
sleep
with
which
benevolent
nature
has
rewarded
those
who
have
a
clear
conscience
and
a
pure
soul
by
the
way
lest
i
forget
i
shall
mention
the
fact
that
i
destroyed
my
diary
of
a
prisoner
that
night
i
had
long
wished
to
do
it
but
the
natural
pity
and
love
which
we
feel
for
our
blunders
and
our
shortcomings
restrained
me
besides
there
was
nothing
in
my
diary
that
could
have
compromised
me
in
any
way
and
if
i
have
destroyed
it
now
it
is
due
solely
to
my
desire
to
throw
my
past
into
oblivion
and
to
save
my
reader
from
the
tediousness
of
long
complaints
and
moans
from
the
horror
of
sacrilegious
cursings
may
it
rest
in
peace
chapter
vi
having
conveyed
to
the
warden
of
our
prison
the
contents
of
my
conversation
with
i
asked
him
not
to
punish
the
young
man
for
spoiling
the
walls
which
would
thus
betray
me
and
i
to
save
the
youth
suggested
the
following
plan
which
was
accepted
by
the
warden
after
a
few
purely
formal
objections
it
is
important
for
him
i
said
that
his
drawings
should
be
preserved
but
it
is
apparently
immaterial
to
him
in
whose
possession
these
drawings
are
let
him
then
avail
himself
of
his
art
paint
your
portrait
mr
warden
and
after
that
the
portraits
of
the
entire
staff
of
your
officials
to
say
nothing
of
the
honour
you
would
show
him
by
this
condescension
an
honour
which
he
will
surely
know
how
to
appreciate
the
painting
may
be
useful
to
you
as
a
very
original
ornament
in
your
drawing
room
or
study
besides
nothing
will
prevent
us
from
destroying
the
drawings
if
we
should
not
care
for
them
for
the
naive
and
somewhat
selfish
young
man
apparently
does
not
even
admit
the
thought
that
anybody
s
hand
would
destroy
his
smiling
the
warden
suggested
with
a
politeness
that
flattered
me
extremely
that
the
series
of
portraits
should
commence
with
mine
i
quote
word
for
word
that
which
the
warden
said
to
me
your
face
actually
calls
for
reproduction
on
canvas
we
shall
hang
your
portrait
in
the
the
zeal
of
creativeness
these
are
the
only
words
i
can
apply
to
the
passionate
silent
agitation
in
which
reproduced
my
features
usually
talkative
he
now
maintained
silence
for
hours
leaving
unanswered
my
jests
and
remarks
be
silent
old
man
be
silent
you
are
at
your
best
when
you
are
silent
he
repeated
persistently
calling
forth
an
involuntary
smile
by
his
zeal
as
a
professional
my
portrait
would
remind
you
my
indulgent
reader
of
that
mysterious
peculiarity
of
artists
according
to
which
they
very
often
transmit
their
own
feelings
even
their
external
features
to
the
subject
upon
which
they
are
working
thus
reproducing
with
remarkable
likeness
the
lower
part
of
my
face
where
kindness
and
the
expression
of
authoritativeness
and
calm
dignity
are
so
harmoniously
blended
undoubtedly
introduced
into
my
eyes
his
own
suffering
and
even
his
horror
their
fixed
immobile
gaze
madness
glimmering
somewhere
in
their
depth
the
painful
eloquence
of
a
deep
and
infinitely
lonely
soul
all
that
was
not
mine
is
this
i
i
exclaimed
laughing
when
from
the
canvas
this
terrible
face
full
of
wild
contradictions
stared
at
me
my
friend
i
do
not
congratulate
you
on
this
portrait
i
do
not
think
it
is
it
is
you
old
man
you
it
is
well
drawn
you
criticise
it
wrongly
where
will
you
hang
it
he
grew
talkative
again
like
a
magpie
that
amiable
young
man
and
all
because
his
wretched
painting
was
to
be
preserved
for
some
time
o
impetuous
o
happy
youth
here
i
could
not
restrain
myself
from
a
little
jest
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
a
lesson
to
the
youngster
so
i
asked
him
with
a
smile
well
mr
artist
what
do
you
think
am
i
murderer
or
not
the
artist
closing
one
eye
examined
me
and
the
portrait
critically
then
whistling
a
polka
he
answered
recklessly
the
devil
knows
you
old
man
i
smiled
understood
my
jest
at
last
burst
out
laughing
and
then
said
with
sudden
seriousness
you
are
speaking
of
the
human
face
but
do
you
know
that
there
is
nothing
worse
in
the
world
than
the
human
face
even
when
it
tells
the
truth
when
it
shouts
about
the
truth
it
lies
it
lies
old
man
for
it
speaks
its
own
language
do
you
know
old
man
a
terrible
incident
happened
to
me
it
was
in
one
of
the
picture
galleries
in
spain
i
was
examining
a
portrait
of
christ
when
suddenly
christ
you
understand
christ
great
eyes
dark
terrible
suffering
sorrow
grief
love
well
in
a
word
christ
suddenly
i
was
struck
with
something
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
the
face
of
the
greatest
wrongdoer
tormented
by
the
greatest
woes
of
repentance
old
man
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
old
man
nearing
my
eyes
to
the
very
face
of
the
artist
i
asked
him
in
a
cautious
whisper
as
the
occasion
required
dividing
each
word
from
the
other
don
t
you
think
that
when
the
devil
tempted
him
in
the
desert
he
did
not
renounce
him
as
he
said
later
but
consented
sold
himself
that
he
did
not
renounce
the
devil
but
sold
himself
do
you
understand
does
not
that
passage
in
the
gospels
seem
doubtful
to
you
extreme
fright
was
expressed
on
the
face
of
my
young
friend
forcing
the
palms
of
his
hands
against
my
chest
as
if
to
push
me
away
he
ejaculated
in
a
voice
so
low
that
i
could
hardly
hear
his
indistinct
words
what
you
say
jesus
sold
himself
what
for
i
explained
softly
that
the
people
my
child
that
the
people
should
believe
well
i
smiled
s
eyes
became
round
as
if
a
noose
was
strangling
him
suddenly
with
that
lack
of
respect
for
old
age
which
was
one
of
his
characteristics
he
threw
me
down
on
the
bed
with
a
sharp
thrust
and
jumped
away
into
a
corner
when
i
was
slowly
getting
up
from
the
awkward
position
into
which
the
unrestraint
of
that
young
man
had
forced
me
i
fell
backward
with
my
head
between
the
pillow
and
the
back
of
the
bed
he
cried
to
me
loudly
don
t
you
dare
don
t
you
dare
get
up
you
but
i
did
not
think
of
rising
to
my
feet
i
simply
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
thus
seated
with
an
involuntary
smile
at
the
passionate
outburst
of
the
youth
i
shook
my
head
good
naturedly
and
laughed
oh
young
man
young
man
you
yourself
have
drawn
me
into
this
theological
but
he
stared
at
me
stubbornly
wide
eyed
and
kept
repeating
sit
there
sit
there
i
did
not
say
this
no
no
you
said
it
you
young
man
you
do
you
remember
spain
the
picture
gallery
you
said
it
and
now
you
deny
it
mocking
my
clumsy
old
age
oh
suddenly
lowered
his
hands
and
admitted
in
a
low
voice
yes
i
said
it
but
you
old
man
i
do
not
remember
what
he
said
after
that
it
is
so
hard
to
recall
all
the
childish
chatter
of
this
kind
but
unfortunately
too
young
man
i
remember
only
that
we
parted
as
friends
and
he
pressed
my
hand
warmly
expressing
to
me
his
sincere
gratitude
even
calling
me
so
far
as
i
can
remember
his
by
the
way
i
succeeded
in
convincing
the
warden
that
the
portrait
of
even
such
a
man
as
i
after
all
a
prisoner
was
out
of
place
in
such
a
solemn
official
room
as
the
office
of
our
prison
and
now
the
portrait
hangs
on
the
wall
of
my
cell
pleasantly
breaking
the
cold
monotony
of
the
pure
white
walls
leaving
for
a
time
our
artist
who
is
now
carried
away
by
the
portrait
of
the
warden
i
shall
continue
my
story
chapter
vii
my
spiritual
clearness
as
i
had
the
pleasure
of
informing
the
reader
before
has
built
up
for
me
a
considerable
circle
of
men
and
women
admirers
with
emotion
i
shall
tell
of
the
pleasant
hours
of
our
hearty
conversations
which
i
modestly
call
my
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
explain
how
i
deserved
it
but
the
majority
of
those
who
come
to
me
regard
me
with
a
feeling
of
the
profoundest
respect
even
adoration
and
only
a
few
come
for
the
purpose
of
arguing
with
me
but
these
arguments
are
usually
of
a
moderate
and
proper
character
i
usually
seat
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
a
soft
and
deep
armchair
which
is
furnished
me
for
this
occasion
by
the
warden
my
hearers
surround
me
closely
and
some
of
them
the
more
enthusiastic
youths
and
maidens
seat
themselves
at
my
feet
having
before
me
an
audience
more
than
half
of
which
is
composed
of
women
and
entirely
disposed
in
my
favour
i
always
appeal
not
so
much
to
the
mind
as
to
the
sensitive
and
truthful
heart
fortunately
i
possess
a
certain
oratorical
power
and
the
customary
effects
of
the
oratorical
art
to
which
all
preachers
beginning
in
all
probability
with
mohammed
have
resorted
and
which
i
can
handle
rather
cleverly
allow
me
to
influence
my
hearers
in
the
desired
direction
it
is
easily
understood
that
to
the
dear
ladies
in
my
audience
i
am
not
so
much
the
sage
who
has
solved
the
mystery
of
the
iron
grate
as
a
great
martyr
of
a
righteous
cause
which
they
do
not
quite
understand
shunning
abstract
discussions
they
eagerly
hang
on
every
word
of
compassion
and
kindness
and
respond
with
the
same
allowing
them
to
love
me
and
to
believe
in
my
immutable
knowledge
of
life
i
afford
them
the
happy
opportunity
to
depart
at
least
for
a
time
from
the
coldness
of
life
from
its
painful
doubts
and
questions
i
say
openly
without
any
false
modesty
which
i
despise
even
as
i
despise
hypocrisy
there
were
lectures
at
which
i
myself
being
in
a
state
of
exaltation
called
forth
in
my
audience
especially
in
my
nervous
lady
visitors
a
mood
of
intense
agitation
which
turned
into
hysterical
laughter
and
tears
of
course
i
am
not
a
prophet
i
am
merely
a
modest
thinker
but
no
one
would
succeed
in
convincing
my
lady
admirers
that
there
is
no
prophetic
meaning
and
significance
in
my
speeches
i
remember
one
such
lecture
which
took
place
two
months
ago
the
night
before
i
could
not
sleep
as
soundly
as
i
usually
slept
perhaps
it
was
simply
because
of
the
full
moon
which
affects
sleep
disturbing
and
interrupting
it
i
vaguely
remember
the
strange
sensation
which
i
experienced
when
the
pale
crescent
of
the
moon
appeared
in
my
window
and
the
iron
squares
cut
it
with
ominous
black
lines
into
small
silver
squares
when
i
started
for
the
lecture
i
felt
exhausted
and
rather
inclined
to
silence
than
to
conversation
the
vision
of
the
night
before
disturbed
me
but
when
i
saw
those
dear
faces
those
eyes
full
of
hope
and
ardent
entreaty
for
friendly
advice
when
i
saw
before
me
that
rich
field
already
ploughed
waiting
only
for
the
good
seed
to
be
sown
my
heart
began
to
burn
with
delight
pity
and
love
avoiding
the
customary
formalities
which
accompany
the
meetings
of
people
declining
the
hands
outstretched
to
greet
me
i
turned
to
the
audience
which
was
agitated
at
the
very
sight
of
me
and
gave
them
my
blessing
with
a
gesture
to
which
i
know
how
to
lend
a
peculiar
majesty
come
unto
me
i
exclaimed
come
unto
me
you
who
have
gone
away
from
that
life
here
in
this
quiet
abode
under
the
sacred
protection
of
the
iron
grate
at
my
heart
overflowing
with
love
you
will
find
rest
and
comfort
my
beloved
children
give
me
your
sad
soul
exhausted
from
suffering
and
i
shall
clothe
it
with
light
i
shall
carry
it
to
those
blissful
lands
where
the
sun
of
eternal
truth
and
love
never
many
had
begun
to
cry
already
but
as
it
was
too
early
for
tears
i
interrupted
them
with
a
gesture
of
fatherly
impatience
and
continued
you
dear
girl
who
came
from
the
world
which
calls
itself
free
what
gloomy
shadows
lie
on
your
charming
and
beautiful
face
and
you
my
daring
youth
why
are
you
so
pale
why
do
i
see
instead
of
the
ecstasy
of
victory
the
fear
of
defeat
in
your
lowered
eyes
and
you
honest
mother
tell
me
what
wind
has
made
your
eyes
so
red
what
furious
rain
has
lashed
your
wizened
face
what
snow
has
whitened
your
hair
for
it
used
to
be
dark
but
the
weeping
and
the
sobs
drowned
the
end
of
my
speech
and
besides
i
admit
it
without
feeling
ashamed
of
it
i
myself
brushed
away
more
than
one
treacherous
tear
from
my
eyes
without
allowing
the
agitation
to
subside
completely
i
called
in
a
voice
of
stern
and
truthful
reproach
do
not
weep
because
your
soul
is
dark
stricken
with
misfortunes
blinded
by
chaos
clipped
of
its
wings
by
doubts
give
it
to
me
and
i
shall
direct
it
toward
the
light
toward
order
and
reason
i
know
the
truth
i
have
conceived
the
world
i
have
discovered
the
great
principle
of
its
purpose
i
have
solved
the
sacred
formula
of
the
iron
grate
i
demand
of
you
swear
to
me
by
the
cold
iron
of
its
squares
that
henceforth
you
will
confess
to
me
without
shame
or
fear
all
your
deeds
your
errors
and
doubts
all
the
secret
thoughts
of
your
soul
and
the
dreams
and
desires
of
your
body
we
swear
we
swear
we
swear
save
us
reveal
to
us
the
truth
take
our
sins
upon
yourself
save
us
save
us
numerous
exclamations
resounded
i
must
mention
the
sad
incident
which
occurred
during
that
same
lecture
at
the
moment
when
the
excitement
reached
its
height
and
the
hearts
had
already
opened
ready
to
unburden
themselves
a
certain
youth
looking
morose
and
embittered
exclaimed
loudly
evidently
addressing
himself
to
me
liar
do
not
listen
to
him
he
is
lying
the
indulgent
reader
will
easily
believe
that
it
was
only
by
a
great
effort
that
i
succeeded
in
saving
the
incautious
youth
from
the
fury
of
the
audience
offended
in
that
which
is
most
precious
to
a
human
being
his
faith
in
goodness
and
the
divine
purpose
of
life
my
women
admirers
rushed
upon
the
foolish
youth
in
a
mob
and
would
have
beaten
him
cruelly
remembering
however
that
there
was
more
joy
to
the
pastor
in
one
sinner
who
repents
than
in
ten
righteous
men
i
took
the
young
man
aside
where
no
one
could
hear
us
and
entered
into
a
brief
conversation
with
him
did
you
call
me
a
liar
my
child
moved
by
my
kindness
the
poor
young
man
became
confused
and
answered
hesitatingly
pardon
me
for
my
harshness
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
not
telling
the
i
understand
you
my
friend
you
must
have
been
agitated
by
the
intense
ecstasy
of
the
women
and
you
as
a
sensible
man
not
inclined
to
mysticism
suspected
me
of
fraud
of
a
hideous
fraud
no
no
don
t
excuse
yourself
i
understand
you
but
i
wish
you
would
understand
me
out
of
the
mire
of
superstitions
out
of
the
deep
gulf
of
prejudices
and
unfounded
beliefs
i
want
to
lead
their
strayed
thoughts
and
place
them
upon
the
solid
foundation
of
strictly
logical
reasoning
the
iron
grate
which
i
mentioned
is
not
a
mystical
sign
it
is
only
a
formula
a
simple
sober
honest
mathematical
formula
to
you
as
a
sensible
man
i
will
willingly
explain
this
formula
the
grate
is
the
scheme
in
which
are
placed
all
the
laws
guiding
the
universe
which
do
away
with
chaos
substituting
in
its
place
strict
iron
inviolable
order
forgotten
by
mankind
as
a
brightminded
man
you
will
easily
understand
pardon
me
i
did
not
understand
you
and
if
you
will
permit
me
i
but
why
do
you
make
them
swear
my
friend
the
soul
of
man
believing
itself
free
and
constantly
suffering
from
this
spurious
freedom
is
demanding
fetters
for
itself
to
some
these
fetters
are
an
oath
to
others
a
vow
to
still
others
simply
a
word
of
honour
you
will
give
me
your
word
of
honour
will
you
not
i
and
by
this
you
are
simply
striving
to
enter
the
harmony
of
the
world
where
everything
is
subjected
to
a
law
is
not
the
falling
of
a
stone
the
fulfilment
of
a
vow
of
the
vow
called
the
law
of
gravitation
i
shall
not
go
into
detail
about
this
conversation
and
the
others
that
followed
the
obstinate
and
unrestrained
youth
who
had
insulted
me
by
calling
me
liar
became
one
of
my
warmest
adherents
i
must
return
to
the
others
during
the
time
that
i
talked
with
the
young
man
the
desire
for
penitence
among
my
charming
proselytes
reached
its
height
not
patient
enough
to
wait
for
me
they
commenced
in
a
state
of
intense
ecstasy
to
confess
to
one
another
giving
to
the
room
an
appearance
of
a
garden
where
dozens
of
birds
of
paradise
were
twittering
at
the
same
time
when
i
returned
each
of
them
separately
unfolded
her
agitated
soul
to
me
i
saw
how
from
day
to
day
from
hour
to
hour
terrible
chaos
was
struggling
in
their
souls
with
an
eager
inclination
for
harmony
and
order
how
in
the
bloody
struggle
between
eternal
falsehood
and
immortal
truth
falsehood
through
inconceivable
ways
passed
into
truth
and
truth
became
falsehood
i
found
in
the
human
soul
all
the
forces
in
the
world
and
none
of
them
was
dormant
and
in
the
mad
whirlpool
each
soul
became
like
a
fountain
whose
source
is
the
abyss
of
the
sea
and
whose
summit
the
sky
and
every
human
being
as
i
have
learned
and
seen
is
like
the
rich
and
powerful
master
who
gave
a
masquerade
ball
at
his
castle
and
illuminated
it
with
many
lights
and
strange
masks
came
from
everywhere
and
the
master
greeted
them
bowing
courteously
and
vainly
asking
them
who
they
were
and
new
ever
stranger
ever
more
terrible
masks
were
arriving
and
the
master
bowed
to
them
ever
more
courteously
staggering
from
fatigue
and
fear
and
they
were
laughing
and
whispering
strange
words
about
the
eternal
chaos
whence
they
came
obeying
the
call
of
the
master
and
lights
were
burning
in
the
castle
and
in
the
distance
lighted
windows
were
visible
reminding
him
of
the
festival
and
the
exhausted
master
kept
bowing
ever
lower
ever
more
courteously
ever
more
cheerfully
my
indulgent
reader
will
easily
understand
that
in
addition
to
a
certain
sense
of
fear
which
i
experienced
the
greatest
delight
and
even
joyous
emotion
soon
came
upon
me
for
i
saw
that
eternal
chaos
was
defeated
and
the
triumphant
hymn
of
bright
harmony
was
rising
to
the
skies
not
without
a
sense
of
pride
i
shall
mention
the
modest
offerings
by
which
my
kind
admirers
were
striving
to
express
to
me
their
feelings
of
love
and
adoration
i
am
not
afraid
of
calling
out
a
smile
on
the
lips
of
my
readers
for
i
feel
how
comical
it
is
i
will
say
that
among
the
offerings
brought
me
at
first
were
fruit
cakes
all
kinds
of
but
i
am
afraid
however
that
no
one
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
have
actually
declined
these
offerings
preferring
the
observance
of
the
prison
regime
in
all
its
rigidness
at
the
last
lecture
a
kind
and
honourable
lady
brought
me
a
basketful
of
live
flowers
to
my
regret
i
was
compelled
to
decline
this
present
too
forgive
me
madam
but
flowers
do
not
enter
into
the
system
of
our
prison
i
appreciate
very
much
your
magnanimous
attention
i
kiss
your
hands
madam
i
said
but
i
am
compelled
to
decline
the
flowers
travelling
along
the
thorny
road
to
i
must
not
caress
my
eyes
with
the
ephemeral
and
illusionary
beauty
of
these
charming
lilies
and
roses
all
flowers
perish
in
our
prison
yesterday
another
lady
brought
me
a
very
valuable
crucifix
of
ivory
a
family
heirloom
she
said
not
afflicted
with
the
sin
of
hypocrisy
i
told
my
generous
lady
frankly
that
i
do
not
believe
in
miracles
but
at
the
same
time
i
said
i
regard
with
the
profoundest
respect
him
who
is
justly
called
the
saviour
of
the
world
and
i
honour
greatly
his
services
to
mankind
if
i
should
tell
you
madam
that
the
gospel
has
long
been
my
favourite
book
that
there
is
not
a
day
in
my
life
that
i
do
not
open
this
great
book
drawing
from
it
strength
and
courage
to
be
able
to
continue
my
hard
course
you
will
understand
that
your
liberal
gift
could
not
have
fallen
into
better
hands
henceforth
thanks
to
you
the
sad
solitude
of
my
cell
will
vanish
i
am
not
alone
i
bless
you
my
i
can
not
forego
mentioning
the
strange
thoughts
brought
out
by
the
crucifix
as
it
hung
there
beside
my
portrait
it
was
twilight
outside
the
wall
the
bell
was
tolling
heavily
in
the
invisible
church
calling
the
believers
together
in
the
distance
over
the
deserted
field
overgrown
with
high
grass
an
unknown
wanderer
was
plodding
along
passing
into
the
unknown
distance
like
a
little
black
dot
it
was
as
quiet
in
our
prison
as
in
a
sepulchre
i
looked
long
and
attentively
at
the
features
of
jesus
which
were
so
calm
so
joyous
compared
with
him
who
looked
silently
and
dully
from
the
wall
beside
him
and
with
my
habit
formed
during
the
long
years
of
solitude
of
addressing
inanimate
things
aloud
i
said
to
the
motionless
crucifix
good
evening
jesus
i
am
glad
to
welcome
you
in
our
prison
there
are
three
of
us
here
you
i
and
the
one
who
is
looking
from
the
wall
and
i
hope
that
we
three
will
manage
to
live
in
peace
and
in
harmony
he
is
looking
silently
and
you
are
silent
and
your
eyes
are
closed
i
shall
speak
for
the
three
of
us
a
sure
sign
that
our
peace
will
never
be
they
were
silent
and
continuing
i
addressed
my
speech
to
the
portrait
where
are
you
looking
so
intently
and
so
strangely
my
unknown
friend
and
roommate
in
your
eyes
i
see
mystery
and
reproach
is
it
possible
that
you
dare
reproach
him
answer
and
pretending
that
the
portrait
answered
i
continued
in
a
different
voice
with
an
expression
of
extreme
sternness
and
boundless
grief
yes
i
do
reproach
him
jesus
jesus
why
is
your
face
so
pure
so
blissful
you
have
passed
only
over
the
brink
of
human
sufferings
as
over
the
brink
of
an
abyss
and
only
the
foam
of
the
bloody
and
miry
waves
have
touched
you
do
you
command
me
a
human
being
to
sink
into
the
dark
depth
great
is
your
golgotha
jesus
but
too
reverent
and
joyous
and
one
small
but
interesting
stroke
is
missing
the
horror
of
aimlessness
here
i
interrupted
the
speech
of
the
portrait
with
an
expression
of
anger
how
dare
you
i
exclaimed
how
dare
you
speak
of
aimlessness
in
our
prison
they
were
silent
and
suddenly
jesus
without
opening
his
eyes
he
even
seemed
to
close
them
more
tightly
answered
who
knows
the
mysteries
of
the
heart
of
jesus
i
burst
into
laughter
and
my
esteemed
reader
will
easily
understand
this
laughter
it
turned
out
that
i
a
cool
and
sober
mathematician
possessed
a
poetic
talent
and
could
compose
very
interesting
comedies
i
do
not
know
how
all
this
would
have
ended
for
i
had
already
prepared
a
thundering
answer
for
my
roommate
when
the
appearance
of
the
keeper
who
brought
me
food
suddenly
interrupted
me
but
apparently
my
face
bore
traces
of
excitement
for
the
man
asked
me
with
stern
sympathy
were
you
praying
i
do
not
remember
what
i
answered
chapter
viii
last
sunday
a
great
misfortune
occurred
in
our
prison
the
artist
whom
the
reader
knows
already
ended
his
life
in
suicide
by
flinging
himself
from
the
table
with
his
head
against
the
stone
floor
the
fall
and
the
force
of
the
blow
had
been
so
skilfully
calculated
by
the
unfortunate
young
man
that
his
skull
was
split
in
two
the
grief
of
the
warden
was
indescribable
having
called
me
to
the
office
the
warden
without
shaking
hands
with
me
reproached
me
in
angry
and
harsh
terms
for
having
deceived
him
and
he
regained
his
calm
only
after
my
hearty
apologies
and
promises
that
such
accidents
would
not
happen
again
i
promised
to
prepare
a
project
for
watching
the
criminals
which
would
render
suicide
impossible
the
esteemed
wife
of
the
warden
whose
portrait
remained
unfinished
was
also
grieved
by
the
death
of
the
artist
of
course
i
had
not
expected
this
outcome
either
although
a
few
days
before
committing
suicide
had
provoked
in
me
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
upon
entering
his
cell
one
morning
and
greeting
him
i
noticed
with
amazement
that
he
was
sitting
before
his
slate
once
more
drawing
human
figures
what
does
this
mean
my
friend
i
inquired
cautiously
and
how
about
the
portrait
of
the
second
assistant
the
devil
take
it
but
you
the
devil
take
it
after
a
pause
i
remarked
distractedly
your
portrait
of
the
warden
is
meeting
with
great
success
although
some
of
the
people
who
have
seen
it
say
that
the
right
moustache
is
somewhat
shorter
than
the
left
shorter
yes
shorter
but
in
general
they
find
that
you
caught
the
likeness
very
had
put
aside
his
slate
pencil
and
perfectly
calm
said
tell
your
warden
that
i
am
not
going
to
paint
that
prison
riffraff
any
after
these
words
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
but
leave
him
which
i
decided
to
do
but
the
artist
who
could
not
get
along
without
giving
vent
to
his
effusions
seized
me
by
the
hand
and
said
with
his
usual
enthusiasm
just
think
of
it
old
man
what
a
horror
every
day
a
new
repulsive
face
appears
before
me
they
sit
and
stare
at
me
with
their
froglike
eyes
what
am
i
to
do
at
first
i
laughed
i
even
liked
it
but
when
the
froglike
eyes
stared
at
me
every
day
i
was
seized
with
horror
i
was
afraid
they
might
start
to
quack
indeed
there
was
a
certain
fear
even
madness
in
the
eyes
of
the
artist
the
madness
which
shortly
led
him
to
his
untimely
grave
old
man
it
is
necessary
to
have
something
beautiful
do
you
understand
me
and
the
wife
of
the
warden
is
she
not
i
shall
pass
in
silence
the
unbecoming
expressions
with
which
he
spoke
of
the
lady
in
his
excitement
i
must
however
admit
that
to
a
certain
extent
the
artist
was
right
in
his
complaints
i
had
been
present
several
times
at
the
sittings
and
noticed
that
all
who
had
posed
for
the
artist
behaved
rather
unnaturally
sincere
and
naive
conscious
of
the
importance
of
their
position
convinced
that
the
features
of
their
faces
perpetuated
upon
the
canvas
would
go
down
to
posterity
they
exaggerated
somewhat
the
qualities
which
are
so
characteristic
of
their
high
and
responsible
office
in
our
prison
a
certain
bombast
of
pose
an
exaggerated
expression
of
stern
authority
an
obvious
consciousness
of
their
own
importance
and
a
noticeable
contempt
for
those
on
whom
their
eyes
were
directed
all
this
disfigured
their
kind
and
affable
faces
but
i
can
not
understand
what
horrible
features
the
artist
found
where
there
should
have
been
a
smile
i
was
even
indignant
at
the
superficial
attitude
with
which
an
artist
who
considered
himself
talented
and
sensible
passed
the
people
without
noticing
that
a
divine
spark
was
glimmering
in
each
one
of
them
in
the
quest
after
some
fantastic
beauty
he
passed
by
the
true
beauties
with
which
the
human
soul
is
filled
i
can
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
those
unfortunate
people
who
like
because
of
a
peculiar
construction
of
their
brains
always
turn
their
eyes
toward
the
dark
side
whereas
there
is
so
much
joy
and
light
in
our
prison
when
i
said
this
to
i
heard
to
my
regret
the
same
stereotyped
and
indecent
answer
the
devil
take
it
all
i
could
do
was
to
shrug
my
shoulders
suddenly
changing
his
tone
and
bearing
the
artist
turned
to
me
seriously
with
a
question
which
in
my
opinion
was
also
indecent
why
do
you
lie
old
man
i
was
astonished
of
course
i
lie
well
let
it
be
the
truth
if
you
like
but
why
i
am
looking
and
thinking
why
did
you
say
that
why
my
indulgent
reader
who
knows
well
what
the
truth
has
cost
me
will
readily
understand
my
profound
indignation
i
deliberately
mention
this
audacious
and
other
calumnious
phrases
to
show
in
what
an
atmosphere
of
malice
distrust
and
disrespect
i
have
to
plod
along
the
hard
road
of
suffering
he
insisted
rudely
i
have
had
enough
of
your
smiles
tell
me
plainly
why
do
you
speak
so
then
i
admit
i
flared
up
you
want
to
know
why
i
speak
the
truth
because
i
hate
falsehood
and
i
commit
it
to
eternal
anathema
because
fate
has
made
me
a
victim
of
injustice
and
as
a
victim
like
him
who
took
upon
himself
the
great
sin
of
the
world
and
its
great
sufferings
i
wish
to
point
out
the
way
to
mankind
wretched
egoist
you
know
only
yourself
and
your
miserable
art
while
i
love
my
anger
grew
i
felt
the
veins
on
my
forehead
swelling
fool
miserable
dauber
unfortunate
schoolboy
in
love
with
colours
human
beings
pass
before
you
and
you
see
only
their
froglike
eyes
how
did
your
tongue
turn
to
say
such
a
thing
oh
if
you
only
looked
even
once
into
the
human
soul
what
treasures
of
tenderness
love
humble
faith
holy
humility
you
would
have
discovered
there
and
to
you
bold
man
it
would
have
seemed
as
if
you
entered
a
temple
a
bright
illuminated
temple
but
it
is
said
of
people
like
you
do
not
cast
your
pearls
before
the
artist
was
silent
crushed
by
my
angry
and
unrestrained
speech
finally
he
sighed
and
said
forgive
me
old
man
i
am
talking
nonsense
of
course
but
i
am
so
unfortunate
and
so
lonely
of
course
my
dear
old
man
it
is
all
true
about
the
divine
spark
and
about
beauty
but
a
polished
boot
is
also
beautiful
i
can
not
i
can
not
just
think
of
it
how
can
a
man
have
such
moustaches
as
he
has
and
yet
he
is
complaining
that
the
left
moustache
is
shorter
he
laughed
like
a
child
and
heaving
a
sigh
added
i
ll
make
another
attempt
i
will
paint
the
lady
there
is
really
something
good
in
her
although
she
is
after
all
a
he
laughed
again
and
fearing
to
brush
away
with
his
sleeve
the
drawing
on
the
slate
he
cautiously
placed
it
in
the
corner
here
i
did
that
which
my
duty
compelled
me
to
do
seizing
the
slate
i
smashed
it
to
pieces
with
a
powerful
blow
i
thought
that
the
artist
would
rush
upon
me
furiously
but
he
did
not
to
his
weak
mind
my
act
seemed
so
blasphemous
so
supernaturally
horrible
that
his
deathlike
lips
could
not
utter
a
word
what
have
you
done
he
asked
at
last
in
a
low
voice
you
have
broken
it
and
raising
my
hand
i
replied
solemnly
foolish
youth
i
have
done
that
which
i
would
have
done
to
my
heart
if
it
wanted
to
jest
and
mock
me
unfortunate
youth
can
you
not
see
that
your
art
has
long
been
mocking
you
that
from
that
slate
of
yours
the
devil
himself
was
making
hideous
faces
at
you
yes
the
devil
being
far
from
your
wonderful
art
i
did
not
understand
you
at
first
nor
your
longing
your
horror
of
aimlessness
but
when
i
entered
your
cell
and
noticed
you
at
your
ruinous
occupation
i
said
to
myself
it
is
better
that
he
should
not
create
at
all
than
to
create
in
this
manner
listen
to
i
then
revealed
for
the
first
time
to
this
youth
the
sacred
formula
of
the
iron
grate
which
dividing
the
infinite
into
squares
thereby
subjects
it
to
itself
listened
to
my
words
with
emotion
looking
with
the
horror
of
an
ignorant
man
at
the
figures
which
must
have
seemed
to
him
to
be
cabalistic
but
which
were
nothing
else
than
the
ordinary
figures
used
in
mathematics
i
am
your
slave
old
man
he
said
at
last
kissing
my
hand
with
his
cold
lips
no
you
will
be
my
favourite
pupil
my
son
i
bless
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
artist
was
saved
true
he
regarded
me
with
great
joy
which
could
easily
be
explained
by
the
extreme
respect
with
which
i
inspired
him
and
he
painted
the
portrait
of
the
warden
s
wife
with
such
zeal
and
enthusiasm
that
the
esteemed
lady
was
sincerely
moved
and
strange
to
say
the
artist
succeeded
in
making
so
strangely
beautiful
the
features
of
this
woman
who
was
stout
and
no
longer
young
that
the
warden
long
accustomed
to
the
face
of
his
wife
was
greatly
delighted
by
its
new
expression
thus
everything
went
on
smoothly
when
suddenly
this
catastrophe
occurred
the
entire
horror
of
which
i
alone
knew
not
desiring
to
call
forth
any
unnecessary
disputes
i
concealed
from
the
warden
the
fact
that
on
the
eve
of
his
death
the
artist
had
thrown
a
letter
into
my
cell
which
i
noticed
only
in
the
morning
i
did
not
preserve
the
note
nor
do
i
remember
all
that
the
unfortunate
youth
told
me
in
his
farewell
message
i
think
it
was
a
letter
of
thanks
for
my
effort
to
save
him
he
wrote
that
he
regretted
sincerely
that
his
failing
strength
did
not
permit
him
to
avail
himself
of
my
instructions
but
one
phrase
impressed
itself
deeply
in
my
memory
and
you
will
understand
the
reason
for
it
when
i
repeat
it
in
all
its
terrifying
simplicity
i
am
going
away
from
your
prison
thus
read
the
phrase
and
he
really
did
go
away
here
are
the
walls
here
is
the
little
window
in
the
door
here
is
our
prison
but
he
is
not
there
he
has
gone
away
consequently
i
too
could
go
away
instead
of
having
wasted
dozens
of
years
on
a
titanic
struggle
instead
of
being
tormented
by
the
throes
of
despair
instead
of
growing
enfeebled
by
horror
in
the
face
of
unsolved
mysteries
of
striving
to
subject
the
world
to
my
mind
and
my
will
i
could
have
climbed
the
table
and
one
instant
of
pain
i
would
be
free
i
would
be
triumphant
over
the
lock
and
the
walls
over
truth
and
falsehood
over
joys
and
sufferings
i
will
not
say
that
i
had
not
thought
of
suicide
before
as
a
means
of
escaping
from
our
prison
but
now
for
the
first
time
it
appeared
before
me
in
all
its
attractiveness
in
a
fit
of
base
which
i
shall
not
conceal
from
my
reader
even
as
i
do
not
conceal
from
him
my
good
qualities
perhaps
even
in
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
i
momentarily
forgot
all
i
knew
about
our
prison
and
its
great
purpose
i
forgot
i
am
ashamed
to
say
even
the
great
formula
of
the
iron
grate
which
i
conceived
and
mastered
with
such
difficulty
and
i
prepared
a
noose
made
of
my
towel
for
the
purpose
of
strangling
myself
but
at
the
last
moment
when
all
was
ready
and
it
was
but
necessary
to
push
away
the
taburet
i
asked
myself
with
my
habit
of
reasoning
which
did
not
forsake
me
even
at
that
time
but
where
am
i
going
the
answer
was
i
am
going
to
death
but
what
is
death
and
the
answer
was
i
do
not
know
these
brief
reflections
were
enough
for
me
to
come
to
myself
and
with
a
bitter
laugh
at
my
cowardice
i
removed
the
fatal
noose
from
my
neck
just
as
i
had
been
ready
to
sob
for
grief
a
minute
before
so
now
i
laughed
i
laughed
like
a
madman
realising
that
another
trap
placed
before
me
by
derisive
fate
had
so
brilliantly
been
evaded
by
me
oh
how
many
traps
there
are
in
the
life
of
man
like
a
cunning
fisherman
fate
catches
him
now
with
the
alluring
bait
of
some
truth
now
with
the
hairy
little
worm
of
dark
falsehood
now
with
the
phantom
of
life
now
with
the
phantom
of
death
my
dear
young
man
my
fascinating
fool
my
charming
silly
fellow
who
told
you
that
our
prison
ends
here
that
from
one
prison
you
did
not
fall
into
another
prison
from
which
it
will
hardly
be
possible
for
you
to
run
away
you
were
too
hasty
my
friend
you
forgot
to
ask
me
something
else
i
would
have
told
it
to
you
i
would
have
told
you
that
omnipotent
law
reigns
over
that
which
you
call
and
death
just
as
it
reigns
over
that
which
you
call
life
and
existence
only
the
fools
dying
believe
that
they
have
made
an
end
of
themselves
they
have
ended
but
one
form
of
themselves
in
order
to
assume
another
form
immediately
thus
i
reflected
laughing
at
the
foolish
suicide
the
ridiculous
destroyer
of
the
fetters
of
eternity
and
this
is
what
i
said
addressing
myself
to
my
two
silent
roommates
hanging
motionlessly
on
the
white
wall
of
my
cell
i
believe
and
confess
that
our
prison
is
immortal
what
do
you
say
to
this
my
friends
but
they
were
silent
and
having
burst
into
laughter
what
quiet
roommates
i
have
i
undressed
slowly
and
gave
myself
to
peaceful
sleep
in
my
dream
i
saw
another
majestic
prison
and
wonderful
jailers
with
white
wings
on
their
backs
and
the
chief
warden
of
the
prison
himself
i
do
not
remember
whether
there
were
any
little
windows
in
the
doors
or
not
but
i
think
there
were
i
recall
that
something
like
an
angel
s
eye
was
fixed
upon
me
with
tender
attention
and
love
my
indulgent
reader
will
of
course
guess
that
i
am
jesting
i
did
not
dream
at
all
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
dreaming
without
hoping
that
the
warden
occupied
with
pressing
official
affairs
would
understand
me
thoroughly
and
appreciate
my
idea
concerning
the
impossibility
of
escaping
from
our
prison
i
confined
myself
in
my
report
to
an
indication
of
several
ways
in
which
suicides
could
be
averted
with
magnanimous
shortsightedness
peculiar
to
busy
and
trusting
people
the
warden
failed
to
notice
the
weak
points
of
my
project
and
clasped
my
hand
warmly
expressing
to
me
his
gratitude
in
the
name
of
our
entire
prison
on
that
day
i
had
the
honour
for
the
first
time
to
drink
a
glass
of
tea
at
the
home
of
the
warden
in
the
presence
of
his
kind
wife
and
charming
children
who
called
me
tears
of
emotion
which
gathered
in
my
eyes
could
but
faintly
express
the
feelings
that
came
over
me
at
the
request
of
the
warden
s
wife
who
took
a
deep
interest
in
me
i
related
in
detail
the
story
of
the
tragic
murders
which
led
me
so
unexpectedly
and
so
terribly
to
the
prison
i
could
not
find
expressions
strong
enough
there
are
no
expressions
strong
enough
in
the
human
language
to
brand
adequately
the
unknown
criminal
who
not
only
murdered
three
helpless
people
but
who
mocked
them
brutally
in
a
fit
of
blind
and
savage
rage
as
the
investigation
and
the
autopsy
showed
the
murderer
dealt
the
last
blows
after
the
people
had
been
dead
it
is
very
possible
however
even
murderers
should
be
given
their
due
that
the
man
intoxicated
by
the
sight
of
blood
ceased
to
be
a
human
being
and
became
a
beast
the
son
of
chaos
the
child
of
dark
and
terrible
desires
it
was
characteristic
that
the
murderer
after
having
committed
the
crime
drank
wine
and
ate
biscuits
some
of
these
were
left
on
the
table
together
with
the
marks
of
his
fingers
but
there
was
something
so
horrible
that
my
mind
could
neither
understand
nor
explain
the
murderer
after
lighting
a
cigar
himself
apparently
moved
by
a
feeling
of
strange
kindness
put
a
lighted
cigar
between
the
closed
teeth
of
my
father
i
had
not
recalled
these
details
in
many
years
they
had
almost
been
erased
by
the
hand
of
time
and
now
while
relating
them
to
my
shocked
listeners
who
would
not
believe
that
such
horrors
were
possible
i
felt
my
face
turning
pale
and
my
hair
quivering
on
my
head
in
an
outburst
of
grief
and
anger
i
rose
from
my
armchair
and
straightening
myself
to
my
full
height
i
exclaimed
justice
on
earth
is
often
powerless
but
i
implore
heavenly
justice
i
implore
the
justice
of
life
which
never
forgives
i
implore
all
the
higher
laws
under
whose
authority
man
lives
may
the
guilty
one
not
escape
his
deserved
punishment
his
punishment
moved
by
my
sobs
my
listeners
there
and
then
expressed
their
zeal
and
readiness
to
work
for
my
liberation
and
thus
at
least
partly
redeem
the
injustice
heaped
upon
me
i
apologised
and
returned
to
my
cell
evidently
my
old
organism
can
not
bear
such
agitation
any
longer
besides
it
is
hard
even
for
a
strong
man
to
picture
in
his
imagination
certain
images
without
risking
the
loss
of
his
reason
only
in
this
way
can
i
explain
the
strange
hallucination
which
appeared
before
my
fatigued
eyes
in
the
solitude
of
my
cell
as
though
benumbed
i
gazed
aimlessly
at
the
tightly
closed
door
when
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
one
was
standing
behind
me
i
had
felt
this
deceptive
sensation
before
so
i
did
not
turn
around
for
some
time
but
when
i
turned
around
at
last
i
saw
in
the
distance
between
the
crucifix
and
my
portrait
about
a
quarter
of
a
yard
above
the
floor
the
body
of
my
father
as
though
hanging
in
the
air
it
is
hard
for
me
to
give
the
details
for
twilight
had
long
set
in
but
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
it
was
the
image
of
a
corpse
and
not
of
a
living
being
although
a
cigar
was
smoking
in
its
mouth
to
be
more
exact
there
was
no
smoke
from
the
cigar
but
a
faintly
reddish
light
was
seen
it
is
characteristic
that
i
did
not
sense
the
odour
of
tobacco
either
at
that
time
or
later
i
had
long
given
up
smoking
here
i
must
confess
my
weakness
but
the
illusion
was
striking
i
commenced
to
speak
to
the
hallucination
advancing
as
closely
as
possible
the
body
did
not
retreat
as
i
approached
but
remained
perfectly
motionless
i
said
to
the
ghost
i
thank
you
father
you
know
how
your
son
is
suffering
and
you
have
come
you
have
come
to
testify
to
my
innocence
i
thank
you
father
give
me
your
hand
and
with
a
firm
filial
i
will
respond
to
your
unexpected
visit
don
t
you
want
to
let
me
have
your
hand
give
me
your
hand
or
i
will
call
you
a
liar
i
stretched
out
my
hand
but
of
course
the
hallucination
did
not
deem
it
worth
while
to
respond
and
i
was
forever
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
feeling
the
touch
of
a
ghost
the
cry
which
i
uttered
and
which
so
upset
my
friend
the
jailer
creating
some
confusion
in
the
prison
was
called
forth
by
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
phantom
it
was
so
sudden
that
the
space
in
the
place
where
the
corpse
had
been
seemed
to
me
more
terrible
than
the
corpse
itself
such
is
the
power
of
human
imagination
when
excited
it
creates
phantoms
and
visions
peopling
the
bottomless
and
ever
silent
emptiness
with
them
it
is
sad
to
admit
that
there
are
people
however
who
believe
in
ghosts
and
build
upon
this
belief
nonsensical
theories
about
certain
relations
between
the
world
of
the
living
and
the
enigmatic
land
inhabited
by
the
dead
i
understand
that
the
human
ear
and
eye
can
be
deceived
but
how
can
the
great
and
lucid
human
mind
fall
into
such
coarse
and
ridiculous
deception
i
asked
the
jailer
i
feel
a
strange
sensation
as
though
there
were
the
odour
of
cigar
smoke
in
my
cell
don
t
you
smell
it
the
jailer
sniffed
the
air
conscientiously
and
replied
no
i
don
t
you
only
imagined
if
you
need
any
confirmation
here
is
a
splendid
proof
that
all
i
had
seen
if
it
existed
at
all
existed
only
in
the
net
of
my
eye
chapter
ix
something
altogether
unexpected
has
happened
the
efforts
of
my
friends
the
warden
and
his
wife
were
crowned
with
success
and
for
two
months
i
have
been
free
out
of
prison
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
immediately
upon
my
leaving
the
prison
i
occupied
a
very
honourable
position
to
which
i
could
hardly
have
aspired
conscious
of
my
humble
qualities
the
entire
press
met
me
with
unanimous
enthusiasm
numerous
journalists
photographers
even
caricaturists
the
people
of
our
time
are
so
fond
of
laughter
and
clever
witticisms
in
hundreds
of
articles
and
drawings
reproduced
the
story
of
my
remarkable
life
with
striking
unanimity
the
newspapers
assigned
to
me
the
name
of
master
a
highly
flattering
name
which
i
accepted
after
some
hesitation
with
deep
gratitude
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
worth
mentioning
the
few
hostile
notices
called
forth
by
irritation
and
envy
a
vice
which
so
frequently
stains
the
human
soul
in
one
of
these
notices
which
appeared
by
the
way
in
a
very
filthy
little
newspaper
a
certain
scamp
guided
by
wretched
gossip
and
baseless
rumours
about
my
chats
in
our
prison
called
me
a
zealot
and
enraged
by
the
insolence
of
the
miserable
scribbler
my
friends
wanted
to
prosecute
him
but
i
persuaded
them
not
to
do
it
vice
is
its
own
proper
punishment
the
fortune
which
my
kind
mother
had
left
me
and
which
had
grown
considerably
during
the
time
i
was
in
prison
has
enabled
me
to
settle
down
to
a
life
of
luxury
in
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
hotels
i
have
a
large
retinue
of
servants
at
my
command
and
an
automobile
a
splendid
invention
with
which
i
now
became
acquainted
for
the
first
time
and
i
have
skilfully
arranged
my
financial
affairs
live
flowers
brought
to
me
in
abundance
by
my
charming
lady
visitors
give
to
my
nook
the
appearance
of
a
flower
garden
or
even
a
bit
of
a
tropical
forest
my
servant
a
very
decent
young
man
is
in
a
state
of
despair
he
says
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
variety
of
flowers
and
had
never
smelled
such
a
variety
of
odours
at
the
same
time
if
not
for
my
advanced
age
and
the
strict
and
serious
propriety
with
which
i
treat
my
visitors
i
do
not
know
how
far
they
would
have
gone
in
the
expression
of
their
feelings
how
many
perfumed
notes
how
many
languid
sighs
and
humbly
imploring
eyes
there
was
even
a
fascinating
stranger
with
a
black
veil
three
times
she
appeared
mysteriously
and
when
she
learned
that
i
had
visitors
she
disappeared
just
as
mysteriously
i
will
add
that
at
the
present
time
i
have
had
the
honour
of
being
elected
an
honourary
member
of
numerous
humanitarian
organisations
such
as
the
league
of
peace
the
league
for
combating
juvenile
criminality
the
society
of
the
friends
of
man
and
others
besides
at
the
request
of
the
editor
of
one
of
the
most
widely
read
newspapers
i
am
to
begin
next
month
a
series
of
public
lectures
for
which
purpose
i
am
going
on
a
tour
together
with
my
kind
impresario
i
have
already
prepared
my
material
for
the
first
three
lectures
and
in
the
hope
that
my
reader
may
be
interested
i
shall
give
the
synopsis
of
these
lectures
first
lecture
chaos
or
order
the
eternal
struggle
between
chaos
and
order
the
eternal
revolt
and
the
defeat
of
chaos
the
rebel
the
triumph
of
law
and
order
second
lecture
what
is
the
soul
of
man
the
eternal
conflict
in
the
soul
of
man
between
chaos
whence
it
came
and
harmony
whither
it
strives
irresistibly
falsehood
as
the
offspring
of
chaos
and
truth
as
the
child
of
harmony
the
triumph
of
truth
and
the
downfall
of
falsehood
third
lecture
the
explanation
of
the
sacred
formula
of
the
iron
grate
as
my
indulgent
reader
will
see
justice
is
after
all
not
an
empty
sound
and
i
am
getting
a
great
reward
for
my
sufferings
but
not
daring
to
reproach
fate
which
was
so
merciful
to
me
i
nevertheless
do
not
feel
that
sense
of
contentment
which
it
would
seem
i
ought
to
feel
true
at
first
i
was
positively
happy
but
soon
my
habit
for
strictly
logical
reasoning
the
clearness
and
honesty
of
my
views
gained
by
contemplating
the
world
through
a
mathematically
correct
grate
have
led
me
to
a
series
of
disillusions
i
am
afraid
to
say
it
now
with
full
certainty
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
their
life
of
this
freedom
is
a
continuous
and
falsehood
the
life
of
each
of
these
people
whom
i
have
seen
during
these
days
is
moving
in
a
strictly
defined
circle
which
is
just
as
solid
as
the
corridors
of
our
prison
just
as
closed
as
the
dial
of
the
watches
which
they
in
the
innocence
of
their
mind
lift
every
minute
to
their
eyes
not
understanding
the
fatal
meaning
of
the
eternally
moving
hand
which
is
eternally
returning
to
its
place
and
each
of
them
feels
this
even
as
the
circus
horse
probably
feels
it
but
in
a
state
of
strange
blindness
each
one
assures
us
that
he
is
perfectly
free
and
moving
forward
like
the
stupid
bird
which
is
beating
itself
to
exhaustion
against
the
transparent
glass
obstacle
without
understanding
what
it
is
that
obstructs
its
way
these
people
are
helplessly
beating
against
the
walls
of
their
glass
prison
i
was
greatly
mistaken
it
seems
also
in
the
significance
of
the
greetings
which
fell
to
my
lot
when
i
left
the
prison
of
course
i
was
convinced
that
in
me
they
greeted
the
representative
of
our
prison
a
leader
hardened
by
experience
a
master
who
came
to
them
only
for
the
purpose
of
revealing
to
them
the
great
mystery
of
purpose
and
when
they
congratulated
me
upon
the
freedom
granted
to
me
i
responded
with
thanks
not
suspecting
what
an
idiotic
meaning
they
placed
on
the
word
may
i
be
forgiven
this
coarse
expression
but
i
am
powerless
now
to
restrain
my
aversion
for
their
stupid
life
for
their
thoughts
for
their
feelings
foolish
hypocrites
fearing
to
tell
the
truth
even
when
it
adorns
them
my
hardened
truthfulness
was
cruelly
taxed
in
the
midst
of
these
false
and
trivial
people
not
a
single
person
believed
that
i
was
never
so
happy
as
in
prison
why
then
are
they
so
surprised
at
me
and
why
do
they
print
my
portraits
are
there
so
few
idiots
that
are
unhappy
in
prison
and
the
most
remarkable
thing
which
only
my
indulgent
reader
will
be
able
to
appreciate
is
this
often
distrusting
me
completely
they
nevertheless
sincerely
go
into
raptures
over
me
bowing
before
me
clasping
my
hands
and
mumbling
at
every
step
master
master
if
they
only
profited
by
their
constant
lying
but
no
they
are
perfectly
disinterested
and
they
lie
as
though
by
some
one
s
higher
order
they
lie
in
the
fanatical
conviction
that
falsehood
is
in
no
way
different
from
the
truth
wretched
actors
even
incapable
of
a
decent
makeup
they
writhe
from
morning
till
night
on
the
boards
of
the
stage
and
dying
the
most
real
death
suffering
the
most
real
sufferings
they
bring
into
their
deathly
convulsions
the
cheap
art
of
the
harlequin
even
their
crooks
are
not
real
they
only
play
the
roles
of
crooks
while
remaining
honest
people
and
the
role
of
honest
people
is
played
by
rogues
and
played
poorly
and
the
public
sees
it
but
in
the
name
of
the
same
fatal
falsehood
it
gives
them
wreaths
and
bouquets
and
if
there
is
really
a
talented
actor
who
can
wipe
away
the
boundary
between
truth
and
deception
so
that
even
they
begin
to
believe
they
go
into
raptures
call
him
great
start
a
subscription
for
a
monument
but
do
not
give
any
money
desperate
cowards
they
fear
themselves
most
of
all
and
admiring
delightedly
the
reflection
of
their
spuriously
faces
in
the
mirror
they
howl
with
fear
and
rage
when
some
one
incautiously
holds
up
the
mirror
to
their
soul
my
indulgent
reader
should
accept
all
this
relatively
not
forgetting
that
certain
grumblings
are
natural
in
old
age
of
course
i
have
met
quite
a
number
of
most
worthy
people
absolutely
truthful
sincere
and
courageous
i
am
proud
to
admit
that
i
found
among
them
also
a
proper
estimate
of
my
personality
with
the
support
of
these
friends
of
mine
i
hope
to
complete
successfully
my
struggle
for
truth
and
justice
i
am
sufficiently
strong
for
my
sixty
years
and
it
seems
there
is
no
power
that
could
break
my
iron
will
at
times
i
am
seized
with
fatigue
owing
to
their
absurd
mode
of
life
i
have
not
the
proper
rest
even
at
night
the
consciousness
that
while
going
to
bed
i
may
have
forgotten
to
lock
my
bedroom
door
compels
me
to
jump
from
my
bed
dozens
of
times
and
to
feel
the
lock
with
a
quiver
of
horror
not
long
ago
it
happened
that
i
locked
my
door
and
hid
the
key
under
my
pillow
perfectly
confident
that
my
room
was
locked
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
knock
then
the
door
opened
and
my
servant
entered
with
a
smile
on
his
face
you
dear
reader
will
easily
understand
the
horror
i
experienced
at
this
unexpected
visit
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
one
had
entered
my
soul
and
though
i
have
absolutely
nothing
to
conceal
this
breaking
into
my
room
seems
to
me
indecent
to
say
the
least
i
caught
a
cold
a
few
days
ago
there
is
a
terrible
draught
in
their
windows
and
i
asked
my
servant
to
watch
me
at
night
in
the
morning
i
asked
him
in
jest
well
did
i
talk
much
in
my
sleep
no
you
didn
t
talk
at
i
had
a
terrible
dream
and
i
remember
i
even
no
you
smiled
all
the
time
and
i
thought
what
fine
dreams
our
master
must
see
the
dear
youth
must
have
been
sincerely
devoted
to
me
and
i
am
deeply
moved
by
such
devotion
during
these
painful
days
i
shall
sit
down
to
prepare
my
lectures
it
is
high
time
chapter
x
my
god
what
has
happened
to
me
i
do
not
know
how
i
shall
tell
my
reader
about
it
i
was
on
the
brink
of
the
abyss
i
almost
perished
what
cruel
temptations
fate
is
sending
me
fools
we
smile
without
suspecting
anything
when
some
murderous
hand
is
already
lifted
to
attack
us
we
smile
and
the
very
next
instant
we
open
our
eyes
wide
with
horror
i
i
cried
i
cried
another
moment
and
deceived
i
would
have
hurled
myself
down
thinking
that
i
was
flying
toward
the
sky
it
turned
out
that
the
charming
stranger
who
wore
a
dark
veil
and
who
came
to
me
so
mysteriously
three
times
was
no
one
else
than
mme
my
former
fiancee
my
love
my
dream
and
my
suffering
but
order
order
may
my
indulgent
reader
forgive
the
involuntary
incoherence
of
the
preceding
lines
but
i
am
sixty
years
old
and
my
strength
is
beginning
to
fail
me
and
i
am
alone
my
unknown
reader
be
my
friend
at
this
moment
for
i
am
not
of
iron
and
my
strength
is
beginning
to
fail
me
listen
my
friend
i
shall
endeavour
to
tell
you
exactly
and
in
detail
as
objectively
as
my
cold
and
clear
mind
will
be
able
to
do
it
all
that
has
happened
you
must
understand
that
which
my
tongue
may
omit
i
was
sitting
engaged
upon
the
preparation
of
my
lecture
seriously
carried
away
by
the
absorbing
work
when
my
servant
announced
that
the
strange
lady
in
the
black
veil
was
there
again
and
that
she
wished
to
see
me
i
confess
i
was
irritated
that
i
was
ready
to
decline
to
see
her
but
my
curiosity
coupled
with
my
desire
not
to
offend
her
led
me
to
receive
the
unexpected
guest
assuming
the
expression
of
majestic
nobleness
with
which
i
usually
greet
my
visitors
and
softening
that
expression
somewhat
by
a
smile
in
view
of
the
romantic
character
of
the
affair
i
ordered
my
servant
to
open
the
door
please
be
seated
my
dear
guest
i
said
politely
to
the
stranger
who
stood
as
dazed
before
me
still
keeping
the
veil
on
her
face
she
sat
down
although
i
respect
all
secrecy
i
continued
jestingly
i
would
nevertheless
ask
you
to
remove
this
gloomy
cover
which
disfigures
you
does
the
human
face
need
a
mask
the
strange
visitor
declined
in
a
state
of
agitation
very
well
i
ll
take
it
off
but
not
now
later
first
i
want
to
see
you
the
pleasant
voice
of
the
stranger
did
not
call
forth
any
recollections
in
me
deeply
interested
and
even
flattered
i
submitted
to
my
strange
visitor
all
the
treasures
of
my
mind
experience
and
talent
with
enthusiasm
i
related
to
her
the
edifying
story
of
my
life
constantly
illuminating
every
detail
with
a
ray
of
the
great
purpose
in
this
i
availed
myself
partly
of
the
material
on
which
i
had
just
been
working
preparing
my
lectures
the
passionate
attention
with
which
the
strange
lady
listened
to
my
words
the
frequent
deep
sighs
the
nervous
quiver
of
her
thin
fingers
in
her
black
gloves
her
agitated
exclamations
inspired
me
carried
away
by
my
own
narrative
i
confess
i
did
not
pay
proper
attention
to
the
queer
behaviour
of
my
strange
visitor
having
lost
all
restraint
she
now
clasped
my
hands
now
pushed
them
away
she
cried
and
availing
herself
of
each
pause
in
my
speech
she
implored
don
t
don
t
don
t
stop
speaking
i
can
t
listen
to
it
and
at
the
moment
when
i
least
expected
it
she
tore
the
veil
from
her
face
and
before
my
eyes
before
my
eyes
appeared
her
face
the
face
of
my
love
of
my
dream
of
my
boundless
and
bitter
sorrow
perhaps
because
i
lived
all
my
life
dreaming
of
her
alone
with
her
alone
i
was
young
with
her
i
had
developed
and
grown
old
with
her
i
was
advancing
to
the
grave
her
face
seemed
to
me
neither
old
nor
faded
it
was
exactly
as
i
had
pictured
it
in
my
dreams
it
seemed
endlessly
dear
to
me
what
has
happened
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
tens
of
years
i
forgot
that
i
had
a
face
for
the
first
time
in
tens
of
years
i
looked
helplessly
like
a
youngster
like
a
criminal
caught
waiting
for
some
deadly
blow
you
see
you
see
it
is
i
it
is
i
my
god
why
are
you
silent
don
t
you
recognise
me
did
i
recognise
her
it
were
better
not
to
have
known
that
face
at
all
it
were
better
for
me
to
have
grown
blind
rather
than
to
see
her
again
why
are
you
silent
how
terrible
you
are
you
have
forgotten
me
madam
of
course
i
should
have
continued
in
this
manner
i
saw
how
she
staggered
i
saw
how
with
trembling
fingers
almost
falling
she
was
looking
for
her
veil
i
saw
that
another
word
of
courageous
truth
and
the
terrible
vision
would
vanish
never
to
appear
again
but
some
stranger
within
me
not
i
not
i
uttered
the
following
absurd
ridiculous
phrase
in
which
despite
its
chilliness
rang
so
much
jealousy
and
hopeless
sorrow
madam
you
have
deceived
me
i
don
t
know
you
perhaps
you
entered
the
wrong
door
i
suppose
your
husband
and
your
children
are
waiting
for
you
please
my
servant
will
take
you
down
to
the
could
i
think
that
these
words
uttered
in
the
same
stern
and
cold
voice
would
have
such
a
strange
effect
upon
the
woman
s
heart
with
a
cry
all
the
bitter
passion
of
which
i
could
not
describe
she
threw
herself
before
me
on
her
knees
exclaiming
so
you
do
love
me
forgetting
that
our
life
had
already
been
lived
that
we
were
old
that
all
had
been
ruined
and
scattered
like
dust
by
time
and
that
it
can
never
return
again
forgetting
that
i
was
grey
that
my
shoulders
were
bent
that
the
voice
of
passion
sounds
strangely
when
it
comes
from
old
lips
i
burst
into
impetuous
reproaches
and
complaints
yes
i
did
deceive
you
her
deathly
pale
lips
uttered
i
knew
that
you
were
innocent
be
silent
be
everybody
laughed
at
me
even
your
friends
your
mother
whom
i
despised
for
it
all
betrayed
you
only
i
kept
repeating
he
is
innocent
oh
if
this
woman
knew
what
she
was
doing
to
me
with
her
words
if
the
trumpet
of
the
angel
announcing
the
day
of
judgment
had
resounded
at
my
very
ear
i
would
not
have
been
so
frightened
as
now
what
is
the
blaring
of
a
trumpet
calling
to
battle
and
struggle
to
the
ear
of
the
brave
it
was
as
if
an
abyss
had
opened
at
my
feet
it
was
as
if
an
abyss
had
opened
before
me
and
as
though
blinded
by
lightning
as
though
dazed
by
a
blow
i
shouted
in
an
outburst
of
wild
and
strange
ecstasy
be
silent
i
if
that
woman
were
sent
by
god
she
would
have
become
silent
if
she
were
sent
by
the
devil
she
would
have
become
silent
even
then
but
there
was
neither
god
nor
devil
in
her
and
interrupting
me
not
permitting
me
to
finish
the
phrase
she
went
on
no
i
will
not
be
silent
i
must
tell
you
all
i
have
waited
for
you
so
many
years
listen
listen
but
suddenly
she
saw
my
face
and
she
retreated
seized
with
horror
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
do
you
laugh
i
am
afraid
of
your
laughter
stop
laughing
don
t
don
t
but
i
was
not
laughing
at
all
i
only
smiled
softly
and
then
i
said
very
seriously
without
smiling
i
am
smiling
because
i
am
glad
to
see
you
tell
me
about
and
as
in
a
dream
i
saw
her
face
and
i
heard
her
soft
terrible
whisper
you
know
that
i
love
you
you
know
that
all
my
life
i
loved
you
alone
i
lived
with
another
and
was
faithful
to
him
i
have
children
but
you
know
they
are
all
strangers
to
me
he
and
the
children
and
i
myself
yes
i
deceived
you
i
am
a
criminal
but
i
do
not
know
how
it
happened
he
was
so
kind
to
me
he
made
me
believe
that
he
was
convinced
of
your
innocence
later
i
learned
that
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
and
with
this
just
think
of
it
with
this
he
won
you
lie
i
swear
to
you
for
a
whole
year
he
followed
me
and
spoke
only
of
you
one
day
he
even
cried
when
i
told
him
about
you
about
your
sufferings
about
your
but
he
was
lying
of
course
he
was
lying
but
at
that
time
he
seemed
so
dear
to
me
so
kind
that
i
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
then
we
used
to
bring
you
flowers
to
the
prison
one
day
as
we
were
returning
from
you
listen
he
suddenly
proposed
that
we
should
go
out
driving
the
evening
was
so
beautiful
and
you
went
how
did
you
dare
go
out
with
him
you
had
just
seen
my
prison
you
had
just
been
near
me
and
yet
you
dared
go
with
him
how
base
be
silent
be
silent
i
know
i
am
a
criminal
but
i
was
so
exhausted
so
tired
and
you
were
so
far
away
understand
she
began
to
cry
wringing
her
hands
understand
me
i
was
so
exhausted
and
he
he
saw
how
i
felt
and
yet
he
dared
kiss
he
kissed
you
and
you
allowed
him
on
the
lips
no
no
only
on
the
you
lie
no
no
i
swear
to
i
began
to
laugh
you
responded
and
you
were
driving
in
the
forest
you
my
fiancee
my
love
my
dream
and
all
this
for
my
sake
tell
me
speak
in
my
rage
i
wrung
her
arms
and
wriggling
like
a
snake
vainly
trying
to
evade
my
look
she
whispered
forgive
me
forgive
how
many
children
have
you
forgive
but
my
reason
forsook
me
and
in
my
growing
rage
i
cried
stamping
my
foot
how
many
children
have
you
speak
or
i
will
kill
you
i
actually
said
this
evidently
i
was
losing
my
reason
completely
if
i
could
threaten
to
kill
a
helpless
woman
and
she
surmising
apparently
that
my
threats
were
mere
words
answered
with
feigned
readiness
kill
me
you
have
a
right
to
do
it
i
am
a
criminal
i
deceived
you
you
are
a
martyr
a
saint
when
you
told
me
is
it
true
that
even
in
your
thoughts
you
never
deceived
me
even
in
your
thoughts
and
again
an
abyss
opened
before
me
everything
trembled
everything
fell
everything
became
an
absurd
dream
and
in
the
last
effort
to
save
my
extinguishing
reason
i
shouted
but
you
are
happy
you
can
not
be
unhappy
you
have
no
right
to
be
unhappy
otherwise
i
shall
lose
my
but
she
did
not
understand
with
a
bitter
laugh
with
a
senseless
smile
in
which
her
suffering
mingled
with
bright
heavenly
joy
she
said
i
am
happy
i
happy
oh
my
friend
only
near
you
i
can
find
happiness
from
the
moment
you
left
the
prison
i
began
to
despise
my
home
i
am
alone
there
i
am
a
stranger
to
all
if
you
only
knew
how
i
hate
that
scoundrel
you
are
sensible
you
must
have
felt
that
you
were
not
alone
in
prison
that
i
was
always
with
you
there
and
he
be
silent
be
silent
if
you
only
heard
with
what
delight
i
called
him
scoundrel
she
burst
into
laughter
frightening
me
by
the
wild
expression
on
her
face
just
think
of
it
all
his
life
he
embraced
only
a
lie
and
when
deceived
happy
he
fell
asleep
i
looked
at
him
with
eyes
i
gnashed
my
teeth
softly
and
i
felt
like
pinching
him
like
sticking
him
with
a
she
burst
into
laughter
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
driving
wedges
into
my
brain
clasping
my
head
i
cried
you
lie
you
lie
to
me
indeed
it
was
easier
for
me
to
speak
to
the
ghost
than
to
the
woman
what
could
i
say
to
her
my
mind
was
growing
dim
and
how
could
i
repulse
her
when
she
full
of
love
and
passion
kissed
my
hands
my
eyes
my
face
it
was
she
my
love
my
dream
my
bitter
sorrow
i
love
you
i
love
you
and
i
believed
her
i
believed
her
love
i
believed
everything
and
once
more
i
felt
that
my
locks
were
black
and
i
saw
myself
young
again
and
i
knelt
before
her
and
wept
for
a
long
time
and
whispered
to
her
about
my
sufferings
about
the
pain
of
solitude
about
a
heart
cruelly
broken
about
offended
disfigured
mutilated
thoughts
and
laughing
and
crying
she
stroked
my
hair
suddenly
she
noticed
that
it
was
grey
and
she
cried
strangely
what
is
it
and
life
i
am
an
old
woman
on
leaving
me
she
demanded
that
i
escort
her
to
the
threshold
like
a
young
man
and
i
did
before
going
she
said
to
me
i
am
coming
back
i
know
my
children
will
deny
me
my
daughter
is
to
marry
soon
you
and
i
will
go
away
do
you
love
me
i
we
will
go
far
far
away
my
dear
you
wanted
to
deliver
some
lectures
you
should
not
do
it
i
don
t
like
what
you
say
about
that
iron
grate
you
are
exhausted
you
need
a
rest
shall
it
be
so
oh
i
forgot
my
veil
keep
it
keep
it
as
a
remembrance
of
this
day
my
dear
in
the
vestibule
in
the
presence
of
the
sleepy
porter
she
kissed
me
there
was
the
odour
of
some
new
perfume
unlike
the
perfume
with
which
her
letter
was
scented
and
her
coquettish
laugh
was
like
a
sob
as
she
disappeared
behind
the
glass
door
that
night
i
aroused
my
servant
ordered
him
to
pack
our
things
and
we
went
away
i
shall
not
say
where
i
am
at
present
but
last
night
and
trees
were
rustling
over
my
head
and
the
rain
was
beating
against
my
windows
here
the
windows
are
small
and
i
feel
much
better
i
wrote
her
a
rather
long
letter
the
contents
of
which
i
shall
not
reproduce
i
shall
never
see
her
again
but
what
am
i
to
do
may
the
reader
pardon
these
incoherent
questions
they
are
so
natural
in
a
man
in
my
condition
besides
i
caught
an
acute
rheumatism
while
travelling
which
is
most
painful
and
even
dangerous
for
a
man
of
my
age
and
which
does
not
permit
me
to
reason
calmly
for
some
reason
or
another
i
think
very
often
about
my
young
friend
who
went
to
an
untimely
grave
how
does
he
feel
in
his
new
prison
morning
if
my
strength
will
permit
me
i
intend
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
warden
of
our
prison
and
to
his
esteemed
wife
our
prison
chapter
xi
i
am
profoundly
happy
to
inform
my
dear
reader
that
i
have
completely
recovered
my
physical
as
well
as
my
spiritual
powers
a
long
rest
out
in
the
country
amid
nature
s
soothing
beauties
the
contemplation
of
village
life
which
is
so
simple
and
bright
the
absence
of
the
noise
of
the
city
where
hundreds
of
are
stupidly
flapping
their
long
arms
before
your
very
nose
and
finally
the
complete
solitude
undisturbed
by
anything
all
these
have
restored
to
my
unbalanced
view
of
the
world
all
its
former
steadiness
and
its
iron
irresistible
firmness
i
look
upon
my
future
calmly
and
confidently
and
although
it
promises
me
nothing
but
a
lonely
grave
and
the
last
journey
to
an
unknown
distance
i
am
ready
to
meet
death
just
as
courageously
as
i
lived
my
life
drawing
strength
from
my
solitude
from
the
consciousness
of
my
innocence
and
my
uprightness
after
long
hesitations
which
are
not
quite
intelligible
to
me
now
i
finally
resolved
to
establish
for
myself
the
system
of
our
prison
in
all
its
rigidness
for
that
purpose
finding
a
small
house
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
which
was
to
be
leased
for
a
long
term
of
years
i
hired
it
then
with
the
kind
assistance
of
the
warden
of
our
prison
i
can
not
express
my
gratitude
to
him
adequately
enough
in
words
i
invited
to
the
new
place
one
of
the
most
experienced
jailers
who
is
still
a
young
man
but
already
hardened
in
the
strict
principles
of
our
prison
availing
myself
of
his
instruction
and
also
of
the
suggestions
of
the
obliging
warden
i
have
engaged
workmen
who
transformed
one
of
the
rooms
into
a
cell
the
measurements
as
well
as
the
form
and
all
the
details
of
my
new
and
i
hope
my
last
dwelling
are
strictly
in
accordance
with
my
plan
my
cell
is
by
yards
yards
high
the
walls
are
painted
grey
at
the
bottom
the
upper
part
of
the
walls
and
the
ceiling
are
white
and
near
the
ceiling
there
is
a
square
window
by
yards
with
a
massive
iron
grate
which
has
already
become
rusty
with
age
in
the
door
locked
with
a
heavy
and
strong
lock
which
issues
a
loud
creak
at
each
turn
of
the
key
there
is
a
small
hole
for
observation
and
below
it
a
little
window
through
which
the
food
is
brought
and
received
the
furnishing
of
the
cell
a
table
a
chair
and
a
cot
fastened
to
the
wall
on
the
wall
a
crucifix
my
portrait
and
the
rules
concerning
the
conduct
of
the
prisoners
in
a
black
frame
and
in
the
corner
a
closet
filled
with
books
this
last
being
a
violation
of
the
strict
harmony
of
my
dwelling
i
was
compelled
to
do
by
extreme
and
sad
necessity
the
jailer
positively
refused
to
be
my
librarian
and
to
bring
the
books
according
to
my
order
and
to
engage
a
special
librarian
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
act
of
unnecessary
eccentricity
aside
from
this
in
elaborating
my
plans
i
met
with
strong
opposition
not
only
from
the
local
population
which
simply
declared
me
to
be
insane
but
even
from
the
enlightened
people
even
the
warden
endeavoured
for
some
time
to
dissuade
me
but
finally
he
clasped
my
hand
warmly
with
an
expression
of
sincere
regret
at
not
being
in
a
position
to
offer
me
a
place
in
our
prison
i
can
not
recall
the
first
day
of
my
confinement
without
a
bitter
smile
a
mob
of
impertinent
and
ignorant
idlers
yelled
from
morning
till
night
at
my
window
with
their
heads
lifted
high
my
cell
is
situated
in
the
second
story
and
they
heaped
upon
me
senseless
abuse
there
were
even
efforts
to
the
disgrace
of
my
townspeople
to
storm
my
dwelling
and
one
heavy
stone
almost
crushed
my
head
only
the
police
which
arrived
in
time
succeeded
in
averting
the
catastrophe
when
in
the
evening
i
went
out
for
a
walk
hundreds
of
fools
adults
and
children
followed
me
shouting
and
whistling
heaping
abuse
upon
me
and
even
hurling
mud
at
me
thus
like
a
persecuted
prophet
i
wended
my
way
without
fear
amidst
the
maddened
crowd
answering
their
blows
and
curses
with
proud
silence
what
has
stirred
these
fools
in
what
way
have
i
offended
their
empty
heads
when
i
lied
to
them
they
kissed
my
hands
now
when
i
have
the
sacred
truth
of
my
life
in
all
its
strictness
and
purity
they
burst
into
curses
they
branded
me
with
contempt
they
hurled
mud
at
me
they
were
disturbed
because
i
dared
to
live
alone
and
because
i
did
not
ask
them
for
a
place
in
the
common
cell
for
how
difficult
it
is
to
be
truthful
in
this
world
true
my
perseverance
and
firmness
finally
defeated
them
with
the
naivete
of
savages
who
honour
all
they
do
not
understand
they
commenced
in
the
second
year
to
bow
to
me
and
they
are
making
ever
lower
bows
to
me
because
their
amazement
is
growing
ever
greater
their
fear
of
the
inexplicable
is
growing
ever
deeper
and
the
fact
that
i
never
respond
to
their
greetings
fills
them
with
delight
and
the
fact
that
i
never
smile
in
response
to
their
flattering
smiles
fills
them
with
a
firm
assurance
that
they
are
guilty
before
me
for
some
grave
wrong
and
that
i
know
their
guilt
having
lost
confidence
in
their
own
and
other
people
s
words
they
revere
my
silence
even
as
people
revere
every
silence
and
every
mystery
if
i
were
to
start
to
speak
suddenly
i
would
again
become
human
to
them
and
would
disillusion
them
bitterly
no
matter
what
i
would
say
in
my
silence
i
am
to
them
like
their
eternally
silent
god
for
these
strange
people
would
cease
believing
their
god
as
soon
as
their
god
would
commence
to
speak
their
women
are
already
regarding
me
as
a
saint
and
the
kneeling
women
and
sick
children
that
i
often
find
at
the
threshold
of
my
dwelling
undoubtedly
expect
of
me
a
trifle
to
heal
them
to
perform
a
miracle
well
another
year
or
two
will
pass
and
i
shall
commence
to
perform
miracles
as
well
as
those
of
whom
they
speak
with
such
enthusiasm
strange
people
at
times
i
feel
sorry
for
them
and
i
begin
to
feel
really
angry
at
the
devil
who
so
skilfully
mixed
the
cards
in
their
game
that
only
the
cheat
knows
the
truth
his
little
cheating
truth
about
the
marked
queens
and
the
marked
kings
they
bow
too
low
however
and
this
hinders
me
from
developing
a
sense
of
mercy
otherwise
smile
at
my
jest
indulgent
reader
i
would
not
restrain
myself
from
the
temptation
of
performing
two
or
three
small
but
effective
miracles
i
must
go
back
to
the
description
of
my
prison
having
constructed
my
cell
completely
i
offered
my
jailer
the
following
alternative
he
must
observe
with
regard
to
me
the
rules
of
the
prison
regime
in
all
its
rigidness
and
in
that
case
he
would
inherit
all
my
fortune
according
to
my
will
or
he
would
receive
nothing
if
he
failed
to
do
his
duty
it
seemed
that
in
putting
the
matter
before
him
so
clearly
i
would
meet
with
no
difficulties
yet
at
the
very
first
instance
when
i
should
have
been
incarcerated
for
violating
some
prison
regulation
this
naive
and
timid
man
absolutely
refused
to
do
it
and
only
when
i
threatened
to
get
another
man
immediately
a
more
conscientious
jailer
was
he
compelled
to
perform
his
duty
though
he
always
locked
the
door
punctually
he
at
first
neglected
his
duty
of
watching
me
through
the
peephole
and
when
i
tried
to
test
his
firmness
by
suggesting
a
change
in
some
rule
or
other
to
the
detriment
of
common
sense
he
yielded
willingly
and
quickly
one
day
on
trapping
him
in
this
way
i
said
to
him
my
friend
you
are
simply
foolish
if
you
will
not
watch
me
and
guard
me
properly
i
shall
run
away
to
another
prison
taking
my
legacy
along
with
me
what
will
you
do
then
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
at
the
present
time
all
these
misunderstandings
have
been
removed
and
if
there
is
anything
i
can
complain
of
it
is
rather
excessive
strictness
than
mildness
now
that
my
jailer
has
entered
into
the
spirit
of
his
position
this
honest
man
treats
me
with
extreme
sternness
not
for
the
sake
of
the
profit
but
for
the
sake
of
the
principle
thus
in
the
beginning
of
this
week
he
incarcerated
me
for
hours
for
violating
some
rule
of
which
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
not
guilty
and
protesting
against
this
seeming
injustice
i
had
the
unpardonable
weakness
to
say
to
him
in
the
end
i
will
drive
you
away
from
here
you
must
not
forget
that
you
are
my
before
you
drive
me
away
i
will
incarcerate
you
replied
this
worthy
man
but
how
about
the
money
i
asked
with
astonishment
don
t
you
know
that
you
will
be
deprived
of
it
do
i
need
your
money
i
would
give
up
all
my
own
money
if
i
could
stop
being
what
i
am
but
what
can
i
do
if
you
violate
the
rule
and
i
must
punish
you
by
incarcerating
you
i
am
powerless
to
describe
the
joyous
emotion
which
came
over
me
at
the
thought
that
the
consciousness
of
duty
had
at
last
entered
his
dark
mind
and
that
now
even
if
in
a
moment
of
weakness
i
wanted
to
leave
my
prison
my
conscientious
jailer
would
not
permit
me
to
do
it
the
spark
of
firmness
which
glittered
in
his
round
eyes
showed
me
clearly
that
no
matter
where
i
might
run
away
he
would
find
me
and
bring
me
back
and
that
the
revolver
which
he
often
forgot
to
take
before
and
which
he
now
cleans
every
day
would
do
its
work
in
the
event
i
decided
to
run
away
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
these
years
i
fell
asleep
on
the
stone
floor
of
my
dark
cell
with
a
happy
smile
realising
that
my
plan
was
crowned
with
complete
success
passing
from
the
realm
of
eccentricity
to
the
domain
of
stern
and
austere
reality
and
the
fear
which
i
felt
while
falling
asleep
in
the
presence
of
my
jailer
my
fear
of
his
resolute
look
of
his
revolver
my
timid
desire
to
hear
a
word
of
praise
from
him
or
to
call
forth
perhaps
a
smile
on
his
lips
in
my
soul
as
the
harmonious
clanking
of
my
eternal
and
last
chains
thus
i
pass
my
last
years
as
before
my
health
is
sound
and
my
free
spirit
is
clear
let
some
call
me
a
fool
and
laugh
at
me
in
their
pitiful
blindness
let
others
regard
me
as
a
saint
and
expect
me
to
perform
miracles
an
upright
man
to
some
people
to
others
a
liar
and
a
deceiver
i
myself
know
who
i
am
and
i
do
not
ask
them
to
understand
me
and
if
there
are
people
who
will
accuse
me
of
deception
of
baseness
even
of
the
lack
of
simple
honour
for
there
are
scoundrels
who
are
convinced
to
this
day
that
i
committed
murder
no
one
will
dare
accuse
me
of
cowardice
no
one
will
dare
say
that
i
could
not
perform
my
painful
duty
to
the
end
from
the
beginning
till
the
end
i
remained
firm
and
unbribable
and
though
a
bugbear
a
fanatic
a
dark
horror
to
some
people
i
may
awaken
in
others
a
heroic
dream
of
the
infinite
power
of
man
i
have
long
discontinued
to
receive
visitors
and
with
the
death
of
the
warden
of
our
prison
my
only
true
friend
whom
i
visited
occasionally
my
last
tie
with
this
world
was
broken
only
i
and
my
ferocious
jailer
who
watches
every
movement
of
mine
with
mad
suspicion
and
the
black
grate
which
has
caught
in
its
iron
embrace
and
muzzled
the
infinite
this
is
my
life
silently
accepting
the
low
bows
in
my
cold
estrangement
from
the
people
i
am
passing
my
last
road
i
am
thinking
of
death
ever
more
frequently
but
even
before
death
i
do
not
bend
my
fearless
look
whether
it
brings
me
eternal
rest
or
a
new
unknown
and
terrible
struggle
i
am
humbly
prepared
to
accept
it
farewell
my
dear
reader
like
a
vague
phantom
you
appeared
before
my
eyes
and
passed
leaving
me
alone
before
the
face
of
life
and
death
do
not
be
angry
because
at
times
i
deceived
you
and
lied
you
too
would
have
lied
perhaps
in
my
place
nevertheless
i
loved
you
sincerely
and
sincerely
longed
for
your
love
and
the
thought
of
your
sympathy
for
me
was
quite
a
support
to
me
in
my
moments
and
days
of
hardship
i
am
sending
you
my
last
farewell
and
my
sincere
advice
forget
about
my
existence
even
as
i
shall
henceforth
forget
about
yours
forever
a
deserted
field
overgrown
with
high
grass
devoid
of
an
echo
extends
like
a
deep
carpet
to
the
very
fence
of
our
prison
whose
majestic
outlines
subdue
my
imagination
and
my
mind
when
the
dying
sun
illumines
it
with
its
last
rays
and
our
prison
all
in
red
stands
like
a
queen
like
a
martyr
with
the
dark
wounds
of
its
grated
windows
and
the
sun
rises
silently
and
proudly
over
the
plain
with
sorrow
like
a
lover
i
send
my
complaints
and
my
sighs
and
my
tender
reproach
and
vows
to
her
to
my
love
to
my
dream
to
my
bitter
and
last
sorrow
i
wish
i
could
forever
remain
near
her
but
here
i
look
back
and
black
against
the
fiery
frame
of
the
sunset
stands
my
jailer
stands
and
waits
with
a
sigh
i
go
back
in
silence
and
he
moves
behind
me
noiselessly
about
two
steps
away
watching
every
move
of
mine
our
prison
is
beautiful
at
sunset
